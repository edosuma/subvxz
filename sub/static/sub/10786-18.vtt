WEBVTT

00:09.458 --> 00:10.041
OHH!

00:10.041 --> 00:10.959
ARE YOU INSANE?

00:10.959 --> 00:13.333
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

00:13.333 --> 00:15.834
HOW COULD YOU TAKE SOME
SIMPLE DECLARATION
OF FRIENDSHIP

00:15.834 --> 00:18.166
AS AN INVITATION
TO JUST MAUL ME, PACEY?

00:18.166 --> 00:20.166
ANSWER ME.

00:20.166 --> 00:20.500
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

00:20.500 --> 00:22.458
WHAT?

00:22.458 --> 00:23.834
WHAT? I DON'T KNOW.
GOD.

00:23.834 --> 00:25.959
IT--IT--IT WAS AN IMPULSE.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.041
AN IMPULSE?!

00:27.041 --> 00:28.792
YES, AN IMPULSE.

00:28.792 --> 00:31.041
SUDDEN, MOMENTARY,
AND, BELIEVE ME, FLEETING.

00:31.041 --> 00:33.333
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
OF THE MONUMENTAL
IMPLICATIONS

00:33.333 --> 00:35.667
OF THAT MEANINGLESS
LITTLE IMPULSE?

00:35.667 --> 00:37.375
THE RIPPLE EFFECT
THAT IT COULD CREATE

00:37.375 --> 00:38.792
IN OUR SMALL BUT
FRAGILE UNIVERSE?

00:38.792 --> 00:42.208
YOU'RE RIGHT. FORGIVE ME FOR
THINKING A KISS IS JUST A KISS.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.875
WELL, IT'S TRUE.
A KISS IS NOT
JUST A KISS,

00:43.875 --> 00:45.417
NOT BETWEEN
YOU AND ME,

00:45.417 --> 00:47.542
AND YOU KNOW WHY.

00:47.542 --> 00:48.875
DAWSON?

00:48.875 --> 00:50.041
REMEMBER?

00:50.041 --> 00:54.417
HE FACTORS INTO
THIS LITTLE...
HORMONAL MELTDOWN.

00:54.417 --> 00:55.041
"MELTDOWN"?
YEAH.

00:55.041 --> 00:57.375
I JUST HAD A MELTDOWN?

00:57.375 --> 00:59.875
FORGIVE ME IF I DON'T
THINK THAT THIS IS
THE WORST TRAGEDY

00:59.875 --> 01:01.542
IN THE HISTORY
OF HUMANKIND--

01:01.542 --> 01:03.208
THAT PACEY WITTER,
IN A MOMENT OF...

01:03.208 --> 01:05.875
IMPULSIVE, COMPULSIVE,
HORMONE-INDUCED INSANITY,

01:05.875 --> 01:06.875
WOULD HAVE THE NERVE
TO KISS JOEY POTTER.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.792
AND YOU LET ME DO IT.

01:08.792 --> 01:10.083
YOU DID, YOU LET ME DO IT.

01:10.083 --> 01:12.583
SO, WHAT, NOW I GUESS
THE UNIVERSE BEGINS
TO UNRAVEL.

01:12.583 --> 01:13.333
WELL, EXCUSE ME WHILE
I GET IN THE CAR.

01:16.375 --> 01:17.750
OH!

01:19.667 --> 01:21.583
WOULD YOU GET
IN THE CAR, POTTER!

01:21.583 --> 01:23.208
NO!

01:33.417 --> 01:34.959
WILL YOU JUST GET
IN THE CAR, POTTER,

01:34.959 --> 01:37.083
PLEASE?
NO.

01:37.083 --> 01:38.083
I DIDN'T EVEN
MEAN TO DO IT.

01:38.083 --> 01:39.667
YOU KNOW? THIS IS ME
PACEY--

01:39.667 --> 01:41.208
ACT FIRST,
THINK LATER.

01:41.208 --> 01:43.333
AND NOW THAT I'M
GETTING A CHANCE
TO THINK ABOUT IT,

01:43.333 --> 01:43.959
I TAKE IT
ALL BACK, OK?

01:43.959 --> 01:45.750
SO GET IN THE CAR.

01:45.750 --> 01:47.417
NO.

01:47.417 --> 01:49.500
JO, IT'S AT LEAST
ANOTHER 6 MILES
TO YOUR HOUSE.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.333
IT IS FREEZING COLD
OUTSIDE.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.583
AND IF YOU DON'T GET IN,

01:52.583 --> 01:54.375
I'M JUST GONNA DO THIS
THE WHOLE WAY THERE.

01:54.375 --> 01:55.583
SO WOULD YOU
GET IN, PLEASE?

02:00.542 --> 02:02.667
[SIGHS]

02:06.959 --> 02:09.083
SO I GUESS
I'M TO TAKE IT
FROM YOUR ANGRY SILENCE

02:09.083 --> 02:10.667
THAT YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING
TO ME ANYMORE.

02:10.667 --> 02:12.500
NOPE.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.125
GREAT, GREAT. AND HOW LONG
YOU PLANNING ON KEEPING
THAT UP?

02:14.125 --> 02:15.959
HOW DOES "INDEFINITELY"
SOUND?

02:15.959 --> 02:18.041
FINE.
FINE.

02:18.041 --> 02:19.542
FINE.
FINE.

03:11.333 --> 03:14.959
SO, ARE YOU PLANNING
TO FILL ME IN,

03:14.959 --> 03:16.667
OR DO I HAVE TO DIE
FROM ANTICIPATION?

03:16.667 --> 03:17.333
WHAT?

03:17.333 --> 03:19.625
HOW WAS IT SEEING A.J.?

03:19.625 --> 03:21.708
AND LEAVE NO SORDID
DETAIL UNTURNED.

03:21.708 --> 03:25.166
WELL, LET'S SEE...
WE BROKE UP,

03:25.166 --> 03:26.959
AND THEN PACEY
WENT INSANE
AND KISSED ME.

03:26.959 --> 03:29.458
HEY, YOU KISSED HER.
GOOD FOR YOU.

03:29.458 --> 03:31.041
Bessie: OH, MY GOD.

03:31.041 --> 03:32.542
OH, MY GOD.

03:32.542 --> 03:34.500
HOW COULD HE
DO THIS TO YOU?

03:36.083 --> 03:38.959
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
I MAYBE SORT OF...

03:38.959 --> 03:40.375
LET HIM DO IT TO ME,

03:40.375 --> 03:43.208
BUT I STILL BLAME HIM
ENTIRELY.

03:43.208 --> 03:44.625
THE WHOLE THING
WAS HER FAULT.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.959
I MEAN, SHE TOLD ME
THAT I WAS THE ONE
SHE THINKS ABOUT.

03:46.959 --> 03:48.166
YOU KNOW? ME.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.417
AND THEN SHE GIVES ME
THIS LOOK.

03:50.417 --> 03:51.750
WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

03:51.750 --> 03:53.333
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
I'VE BEEN WAITING

03:53.333 --> 03:54.959
FOR HER TO GIVE ME
THAT LOOK?

03:54.959 --> 03:56.375
AND THEN HE GAVE ME
THIS LOOK,

03:56.375 --> 03:57.417
THIS LOOK, LIKE...

03:57.417 --> 03:58.625
I KNOW THE LOOK.

03:58.625 --> 03:59.917
Doug: LOOK,
I DON'T GET IT.

03:59.917 --> 04:01.000
SHE GAVE YOU THE LOOK.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.417
YOU KISSED HER,
IT WAS A GOOD KISS.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.458
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

04:04.458 --> 04:06.417
WELL, THE HITTING,
PUNCHING, AND REJECTING.

04:06.417 --> 04:08.250
THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM,
NOT TO MENTION--

04:08.250 --> 04:09.208
DAWSON.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.291
I MEAN,
IF HE FOUND OUT,

04:10.291 --> 04:11.750
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO THINK ABOUT

04:11.750 --> 04:12.875
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF HE FOUND OUT.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.959
WE COULD KISS OUR
FRIENDSHIP GOODBYE.

04:14.959 --> 04:17.041
HE'D NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.
I CAN'T RISK THAT.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.583
HE'S THE BROTHER
I NEVER HAD.

04:18.583 --> 04:20.834
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS JOEY'S LIKE A BUS.

04:20.834 --> 04:23.417
NO. WHAT I'M SAYING
IS JOEY IS LIKE GIRL.

04:23.417 --> 04:24.708
NO, NO.
HEAR ME OUT, OK?

04:24.708 --> 04:27.583
JOEY IS LIKE A BUS
THAT CAN'T GO BELOW 50.

04:27.583 --> 04:30.667
DAWSON IS A BOMB HIDDEN
UNDERNEATH THAT BUS.

04:30.667 --> 04:33.250
AND YOU ARE THE BRAVE,
HEROIC POLICE OFFICER

04:33.250 --> 04:35.125
WANTING TO DRIVE
THE BUS TO SAFETY,

04:35.125 --> 04:36.333
BUT CAN'T
BECAUSE OF THE BOMB.

04:36.333 --> 04:39.500
Joey: DO YOU THINK IT WAS
MORE THAN JUST AN IMPULSE?

04:39.500 --> 04:41.708
I DON'T KNOW, JOEY.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.291
YOU'RE SURE
A BIG HELP.

04:44.708 --> 04:46.625
I'M SORRY. LOOK, I'M OBVIOUSLY
NOT TELLING YOU

04:46.625 --> 04:47.792
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR

04:47.792 --> 04:49.333
BECAUSE I HONESTLY
DON'T KNOW.

04:49.333 --> 04:51.083
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK
TO SOMEONE ABOUT IT,

04:51.083 --> 04:52.875
SOMEONE WHO
COULD HELP YOU
FIGURE IT OUT.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.083
WHO?

04:54.083 --> 04:56.125
DAWSON, PACEY, ANDIE?

04:56.125 --> 04:58.125
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO HELP ME WITH.

04:58.125 --> 05:00.208
I CAN'T SHED LIGHT
ON THIS ONE FOR YOU.

05:00.208 --> 05:02.000
I'M SORRY, JOEY.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.458
Doug: YOU NEED TO
FORGE AHEAD.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.458
THINGS CAN WORK
BETWEEN YOU 2,

05:05.458 --> 05:08.125
IF YOU FIRST
DEFUSE THE BOMB.

05:08.125 --> 05:12.291
PACEY, YOU NEED TO TELL
DAWSON ABOUT JOEY. OK?

05:12.291 --> 05:14.250
NOW, THE TRICK IS
TO DO IT IN A MANNER

05:14.250 --> 05:16.083
THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HIM TO HATE YOU.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.125
NOW, WHAT I SUGGEST IS
YOU TAKE HIM TO A PLACE

05:19.125 --> 05:21.250
THAT REMINDS HIM
OF THE STRONG HISTORY
THE 2 OF YOU SHARE,

05:21.250 --> 05:25.792
A PLACE WHERE HE'LL
THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH
YOU REALLY MEAN TO HIM.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.041
THEN YOU TELL HIM.

05:27.041 --> 05:29.333
OH, SURE, YEAH,
HE'LL BE UPSET,

05:29.333 --> 05:31.125
BUT HE'LL ALSO
UNDERSTAND

05:31.125 --> 05:33.166
THAT YOUR FRIENDSHIP
IS MORE IMPORTANT
TO HIM.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.000
IN FACT, HE'LL PROBABLY
RESPECT THE FACT

05:35.000 --> 05:37.291
THAT YOU CARED ENOUGH
TO TELL HIM
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

05:37.291 --> 05:39.542
IN WHICH CASE,
HE'LL TELL YOU
TO GO RIGHT ON AHEAD.

05:39.542 --> 05:43.834
AND YOU AND JOEY
CAN JUST DRIVE OFF
INTO THE SUNSET.

05:43.834 --> 05:44.917
THAT'S YOUR ADVICE?

05:44.917 --> 05:46.875
AND WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THAT ADVICE?

05:46.875 --> 05:49.166
NOTHING. THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT ADVICE.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.667
IT'S JUST VERY THOUGHT OUT
AND UNDOUGIE-LIKE.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.959
HOWEVER, EVEN IF YOUR
RIDICULOUS PLAN WAS TO WORK,

05:53.959 --> 05:55.708
YOU'VE LEFT OUT A COUPLE
OF MINOR DETAILS,

05:55.708 --> 05:58.083
I.E. HER HITTING,
HER PUNCHING, HER YELLING--

05:58.083 --> 05:59.500
OH, GROW UP,
LITTLE BROTHER.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.625
DO YOU THINK
SHE WOULD'VE REACTED
SO STRONGLY

06:00.625 --> 06:02.834
IF SHE DIDN'T
FEEL SOMETHING?

06:02.834 --> 06:04.125
HMM?

06:06.500 --> 06:09.458
OHH!
THERE WAS NO HOT WATER
IN THE SHOWER TODAY,

06:09.458 --> 06:11.250
I RAN OUT OF SHAMPOO,

06:11.250 --> 06:14.000
AND I HAVE 2 TESTS,
FRENCH AND MATH.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.417
WHAT ARE YOU
SO SMILEY ABOUT?

06:18.417 --> 06:20.041
ETHAN'S COMING
EARLY THIS AFTERNOON.

06:20.041 --> 06:21.959
HE'S GOING
TO SPEND THE WEEKEND.

06:21.959 --> 06:24.208
HMMM!

06:24.208 --> 06:26.917
DO I SMELL A ROMANCE
A-BREWIN', BIG BROTHER?

06:26.917 --> 06:28.375
COME ON.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.417
IT IS POSSIBLE
FOR 2 GAY MALES
TO BE FRIENDS

06:30.417 --> 06:32.250
WITHOUT IT
TURNING SEXUAL,
YOU KNOW?

06:32.250 --> 06:34.166
JACK, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOUR ORIENTATION.

06:34.166 --> 06:38.542
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FACT
THAT YOU CAN'T WIPE THAT GRIN
OFF YOUR FACE.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.208
I'M SERIOUS.

06:40.208 --> 06:43.333
I'M JUST GLAD
I FINALLY FOUND A FRIEND
WHO ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,

06:43.333 --> 06:47.291
ACCEPTS ME FOR WHO I AM
AND UNDERSTANDS.

06:47.291 --> 06:49.041
IT'S JUST A GIGANTIC
RELIEF, THAT'S ALL.

06:49.041 --> 06:52.458
SO, UH, WHAT DOES DAD
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS?

06:52.458 --> 06:54.834
WELL, HE'S GOT
THAT BUSINESS TRIP
THIS WEEKEND ANYWAY,

06:54.834 --> 06:56.959
SO I FIGURED, YOU KNOW,
WHY RISK A FIGHT?

06:57.875 --> 06:59.917
WHAT?

06:59.917 --> 07:01.834
UH, DAD CANCELED IT.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.792
UNH!

07:05.750 --> 07:08.208
OHH.

07:08.208 --> 07:09.417
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:09.417 --> 07:11.166
SO WHAT?

07:11.166 --> 07:12.750
YOU KNOW, IT'S
A HARMLESS SITUATION.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.500
I'M AN ADULT,
PRETTY MUCH,

07:14.500 --> 07:17.417
AND IF I WANT TO HAVE A FRIEND
COME OVER TO THE HOUSE,
I CAN. YOU KNOW?

07:17.417 --> 07:19.333
THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING
HE CAN SAY ABOUT IT.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.500
NOT A DAMN THING
WHO CAN SAY
ABOUT WHAT?

07:22.417 --> 07:24.125
UH, NOT A DAMN THING

07:24.125 --> 07:26.417
THE CONGRESS CAN SAY
TO THE PRESIDENT

07:26.417 --> 07:29.875
IF HE DECIDES TO VETO
THAT NEW TAX INITIATIVE
REFORM THINGY.

07:30.834 --> 07:31.750
OK.

07:33.458 --> 07:34.500
BYE.

07:34.500 --> 07:34.750
BYE.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.458
WHY ARE YOU
SMILING LIKE THAT?

07:47.458 --> 07:49.792
OH, NO REASON.

07:51.583 --> 07:53.625
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, HENRY.

07:53.625 --> 07:54.959
OK.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.500
WHEN, EXACTLY, WERE YOU
PLANNING ON TELLING ME

07:56.500 --> 07:59.125
THAT TOMORROW'S
YOUR BIRTHDAY?

08:00.875 --> 08:02.083
HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?

08:02.083 --> 08:04.125
I HAVE MY SOURCES,

08:04.125 --> 08:07.542
AND IN HONOR OF YOUR BIRTH,
I PLANNED US A LITTLE OUTING.

08:07.542 --> 08:08.792
DINNER, A MOVIE,

08:08.792 --> 08:11.166
THEN COMES YOUR PRESENT,
WHICH WILL REMAIN A SURPRISE,

08:11.166 --> 08:12.667
SO DON'T EVEN TRY
AND GET IT OUT OF ME.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.375
JEN, ACTUALLY,
I CAN'T.

08:14.375 --> 08:17.250
WELL, NOT TOMORROW,
AT LEAST.

08:17.250 --> 08:18.208
WHY NOT?

08:18.208 --> 08:20.208
I HAVE PLANS.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.041
YOU HAVE PLANS
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY?

08:22.041 --> 08:23.625
WITH WHO? YOUR
OTHER GIRLFRIEND?

08:23.625 --> 08:27.792
WITH MY MOM
AND MY FAMILY.

08:27.792 --> 08:30.708
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A FAMILY THING,

08:30.708 --> 08:32.250
NO FRIENDS.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.332
OH.

08:33.332 --> 08:34.332
I--I'M SORRY.

08:34.332 --> 08:37.041
THAT'S COOL.

08:37.041 --> 08:40.041
I MEAN,
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.291
HEY, HENRY.

08:41.291 --> 08:42.166
I'LL SEE YOU AT YOUR PARTY
TOMORROW, MAN.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.125
CAN'T WAIT.

08:47.708 --> 08:50.291
YOU'RE HAVING A BIRTHDAY PARTY
AND YOU DIDN'T INVITE ME?

08:50.291 --> 08:53.000
OH, OK, JUST--JUST
LET ME EXPLAIN, OK?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.625
OH, I CAN'T THINK
OF ONE POSSIBLE THING
YOU WOULD SAY RIGHT NOW

08:55.625 --> 08:58.333
THAT WOULD DIG YOU OUT
OF THE GRAND CANYON-SIZE
HOLE YOU ARE IN.

08:58.333 --> 09:01.375
BUT WHILE YOU FRANTICALLY
SEARCH FOR A SHOVEL,
I'M GOING TO CLASS.

09:15.708 --> 09:17.166
HEY, MAN.

09:17.166 --> 09:18.792
I CAN'T--
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.750
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE DOING THAT.

09:23.959 --> 09:24.917
"CONSTRUCTION
TO BEGIN NEXT WEEK

09:24.917 --> 09:27.083
ON PHASE 3
OF CAPEWOODS CONDOMINIUMS."

09:27.083 --> 09:29.458
AND?

09:29.458 --> 09:32.166
AND?  PACEY,
THEY'RE GONNA
BULLDOZE OUR WOODS.

09:32.166 --> 09:34.625
OUR FORT.

09:34.625 --> 09:37.333
THAT'S WHERE WE DID
ALL OUR PRE-ADOLESCENT
MALE BONDING.

09:37.333 --> 09:39.000
AH, YEAH.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.917
OUR FIRST FURTIVE GLANCES
AT PLAYBOY,

09:40.917 --> 09:44.083
YOU WATCHING ME TAKE
MY FIRST SIPS OF STOLEN BEER.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.667
WE SHOULD PROTEST IT,
YOU KNOW?

09:45.667 --> 09:48.917
WE SHOULD HANDCUFF
OURSELVES TO THE FORT,
OR SOMETHING.

09:48.917 --> 09:50.750
Andie:
YOU SEEM A LITTLE--

09:50.750 --> 09:52.291
I DON'T KNOW--
WEIRD, OR SOMETHING.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.333
I'M FINE.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.125
I'M JOKING.

09:56.125 --> 09:57.792
SO, HOW WAS YOUR WEEKEND?

09:57.792 --> 09:59.208
ANYTHING INTERESTING
HAPPEN?

09:59.208 --> 10:00.041
UM...

10:00.041 --> 10:01.875
NAH.

10:04.583 --> 10:06.750
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE SHOULD DO?

10:06.750 --> 10:09.083
WE SHOULD GO CAMPING.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.000
YOU AND I.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.125
GIVE THE OLD FORT
ONE LAST HURRAH.

10:11.125 --> 10:13.750
REALLY?

10:13.750 --> 10:16.542
YEAH, I MEAN,
THIS COULD BE OUR
LAST CHANCE, MAN.

10:16.542 --> 10:18.000
PACEY AND DAWSON
PAYING HOMAGE

10:18.000 --> 10:20.375
TO THEIR SWIFTLY
DISAPPEARING CHILDHOOD.

10:20.375 --> 10:23.417
THAT'S A REALLY
GOOD IDEA.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.583
LET'S DO IT.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.750
LET'S GO CAMPING.

10:29.959 --> 10:31.792
GREAT.

10:31.792 --> 10:33.458
OK.

10:37.875 --> 10:38.959
WHAT'S WRONG?

10:40.750 --> 10:42.708
WELL, MY BOYFRIEND
IS ASHAMED OF ME

10:42.708 --> 10:44.792
AND A WEASELLY
LITTLE LIAR,

10:44.792 --> 10:45.458
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,

10:45.458 --> 10:48.834
I'M JUST PEACHY.

10:48.834 --> 10:49.917
SORRY, JEN.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.417
ME, TOO.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.667
WELL, GIVEN
THE PATHETIC TRACK RECORD
OF MY LOVE LIFE,

10:53.667 --> 10:55.458
WHY WOULD I
EXPECT ANY LESS?

10:55.458 --> 10:59.000
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT,
FRIENDS?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.417
OTHER GIRLS DON'T HAVE
THESE PROBLEMS LIKE WE DO.

11:01.417 --> 11:02.792
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

11:02.792 --> 11:04.917
BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY
HANG OUT TOGETHER.

11:05.792 --> 11:06.792
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:06.792 --> 11:10.792
I MEAN, THIS MOOD OF YOURS
IS IN CLEAR NEED

11:10.792 --> 11:13.750
OF A LITTLE ESTROGEN
ENERGY BOOST.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.667
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT
THAT THERE'S THIS
MYSTERIOUS BLACK CLOUD

11:15.667 --> 11:17.083
HANGING OVER JOEY'S HEAD.

11:17.083 --> 11:20.375
SO, I THINK THIS CALLS
FOR A GIRLS' NIGHT OUT.

11:21.125 --> 11:22.583
A GIRLS' NIGHT OUT?

11:22.583 --> 11:24.375
YEAH.

11:24.375 --> 11:26.500
OK, DON'T YOU GUYS THINK
IT'S A LITTLE ABNORMAL

11:26.500 --> 11:28.500
THAT THE TWO OF YOU
NEVER HANG OUT WITH ANYBODY

11:28.500 --> 11:30.125
WHO DOESN'T HAVE A PENIS?

11:30.125 --> 11:32.834
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
AT HOW POWERFUL
FEMALE BONDING CAN BE.

11:32.834 --> 11:35.625
HAVEN'T YOU EVER SEEN
THELMA AND LOUISE?

11:35.625 --> 11:37.166
ANDIE, THEY KILLED
SOMEBODY.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.417
AND THEN THEY DROVE
OFF OF A CLIFF.

11:39.417 --> 11:42.875
YEAH, BUT THE POINT IS,
THEY DID IT TOGETHER.
SOLIDARITY.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.834
I MEAN, IN THIS
COLD, CRUEL WORLD,

11:44.834 --> 11:47.583
A GIRL CAN RELY ON
ONE THING: HER SISTERS.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.333
I NEED A LITTLE
FEMALE BONDING,
AND SO DO YOU.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.708
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

12:01.291 --> 12:01.708
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M IN.

12:01.708 --> 12:02.917
YAY, JEN.

12:08.667 --> 12:11.875
YEAH, I'M--
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.

12:11.875 --> 12:12.834
YAY. OK, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA REGRET IT.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.959
HEY, JACK.
HEY.

12:20.959 --> 12:22.166
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

12:22.166 --> 12:24.166
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, MAN.
YOU, TOO.

12:24.542 --> 12:26.208
DAD.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.625
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.333
COULD I SEE YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

12:44.333 --> 12:46.083
WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF THIS?

12:46.083 --> 12:48.542
NO MEANING,
HE'S A FRIEND.

12:50.625 --> 12:52.792
IF YOU HAD JUST
ASKED MY PERMISSION,

12:52.792 --> 12:54.792
YOU WOULD HAVE
SAVED YOURSELF
THE EMBARRASSMENT

12:54.792 --> 12:56.583
OF HAVING TO TELL
THAT BOY TO GO HOME.

12:56.583 --> 13:00.166
HE JUST TOOK
A 2-HOUR TRAIN RIDE
FROM BOARDING SCHOOL.

13:00.166 --> 13:01.792
I'M NOT TELLING HIM
TO GO HOME.

13:01.792 --> 13:04.166
JACK, THIS IS NOT
A GOOD WEEKEND FOR GUESTS.

13:04.166 --> 13:05.083
THIS IS NOT A GOOD
WEEKEND FOR GUESTS,

13:05.083 --> 13:06.250
OR THIS IS NOT
A GOOD WEEKEND

13:06.250 --> 13:08.625
FOR THE KIND OF GUESTS
THAT I WOULD HAVE?

13:08.625 --> 13:09.792
THAT IS NOT
WHAT I SAID.

13:09.792 --> 13:11.792
NO, BUT IT'S
WHAT YOU MEAN.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.667
LOOK, DAD, I DON'T CARE,
ALL RIGHT?

13:13.667 --> 13:14.792
HE'S A FRIEND,
HE'S STAYING.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.375
I DON'T HAVE TO JUSTIFY
THAT TO YOU.

13:16.375 --> 13:18.041
BUT YOU FELT YOU HAD
TO KEEP IT FROM ME,

13:18.041 --> 13:20.542
WHICH MAKES IT
ALL THE MORE CLEAR
THAT IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

13:20.542 --> 13:22.125
YEAH, I FELT I HAD
TO KEEP IT FROM YOU

13:22.125 --> 13:24.291
BECAUSE I KNEW
YOU'D REACT THIS WAY.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.583
MY ANSWER IS NO.

13:26.583 --> 13:27.875
LOOK...

13:28.500 --> 13:30.333
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:30.333 --> 13:33.750
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOUR ANSWER IS,
BECAUSE I'M NOT ASKING.

13:33.750 --> 13:36.208
WHEN I MOVED BACK HOME,
THERE WAS A PROMISE

13:36.208 --> 13:37.917
THAT THIS WOULD BE
AN OPEN HOUSEHOLD,

13:37.917 --> 13:38.959
THAT I COULD
LIVE MY LIFE
FREE OF JUDGMENT.

13:38.959 --> 13:41.125
AS LONG AS YOU'RE
UNDER MY ROOF--

13:41.125 --> 13:43.417
THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE
IS BECAUSE OF ANDIE.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.917
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GLAD YOU CAME
BACK HERE THIS WEEKEND.

13:47.917 --> 13:51.125
'CAUSE IF WATCHING ME
HANG OUT WITH MY FRIENDS
MAKES YOU SUFFER,

13:51.125 --> 13:53.291
THEN YOU
DESERVE TO SUFFER.

14:01.458 --> 14:04.333
GOTTA SAY, THAT WAS GOOD WORK
OUT THERE TODAY, BUZZ.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.708
COUPLE MORE
WEEKENDS LIKE THIS
AND WE'LL BE DONE.

14:05.708 --> 14:08.500
ALL RIGHT,
DOWN YOU COME.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.750
YOU LITTLE MONKEY.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.834
ALL RIGHT, SLAP ME
SOME SKIN, MAN.
IT WAS GOOD WORK.

14:13.834 --> 14:14.792
YOU CAN'T LEAVE YET.

14:14.792 --> 14:17.166
MY FRIENDS
ARE COMING OVER

14:17.166 --> 14:18.542
AND I TOLD THEM ALL
ABOUT MY SEMI-COOL
MENTOR.

14:18.542 --> 14:22.708
I WISH I COULD STAY,
BUT I ALREADY MADE PLANS,
LITTLE BUDDY.

14:22.708 --> 14:24.000
TRYING TO GIVE ME
A COMPLEX ABOUT
MY HEIGHT?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.166
LOOK, THIS HAS BEEN
A TON OF FUN,

14:26.166 --> 14:28.000
BUT I'M ALREADY LATE
TO MEET MY BUDDY, OK?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.333
GIRLFRIEND?

14:29.333 --> 14:31.333
NO, NOSY.
I'M GOING CAMPING
WITH MY BUDDY DAWSON.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.792
BUT I WANT TO GO CAMPING. WHY
DON'T YOU TAKE ME CAMPING?

14:33.792 --> 14:35.458
BUZZ, I CAN'T.
THIS IS A NO-KIDS TRIP.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.208
IT'S JUST ME AND DAWSON.
BUT NEXT TIME--

14:37.208 --> 14:38.708
YOU AND ME, CAMPING.
I PROMISE.

14:38.708 --> 14:39.875
HOW DOES THAT SOUND, HUH?

14:39.875 --> 14:40.917
SEE YOU ON SUNDAY?

14:40.917 --> 14:42.166
WHATEVER.

14:42.166 --> 14:43.166
BYE, PACEY.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.542
OK.

14:52.166 --> 14:54.959
Andie: I'LL GO FIRST.

14:54.959 --> 14:57.708
FACIALS AND PEDICURES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:59.917 --> 15:02.500
GREAT! OK, I'LL GO
GET THE STUFF READY.

15:06.667 --> 15:07.000
SO, WHAT'S UP?

15:09.875 --> 15:11.834
NOT MUCH.

15:11.834 --> 15:14.250
REALLY?

15:14.250 --> 15:17.208
'CAUSE, JOEY, IF YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH

15:17.208 --> 15:19.166
A PARTICULAR SITUATION
RIGHT NOW

15:19.166 --> 15:21.667
AND YOU NEED SOMEBODY
TO TALK TO,

15:21.667 --> 15:25.834
SOMEBODY TO SHED LIGHT
BUT YET WHO'S STILL
UNINVOLVED,

15:25.834 --> 15:27.583
I JUST WANTED TO
LET YOU KNOW I'M HERE.

15:27.583 --> 15:30.208
DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE

15:30.208 --> 15:31.208
ABOUT A PARTICULAR
SITUATION?

15:36.375 --> 15:39.375
YOU, ME, DAWSON, PACEY--
IT'S A REAL INCESTUOUS
LITTLE GROUP.

15:39.375 --> 15:41.583
NOW, I KNOW I'M JUST
STANDING ON THE PERIPHERY,

15:41.583 --> 15:44.542
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
THERE'S A WHOLE
WORLD BALANCE

15:44.542 --> 15:45.708
THAT'S DEFINITELY
BEEN SHIFTING.

15:45.708 --> 15:49.708
YOU KNOW, WHAT I'D
LIKE TO KNOW IS...

15:49.708 --> 15:51.083
HOW SOME MEANINGLESS
IMPULSIVE SCENARIO--

15:51.083 --> 15:53.500
WHICH WAS OVER
BEFORE IT BEGAN--

15:53.500 --> 15:54.792
SOMEHOW BECAME
PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE.

15:54.792 --> 15:57.583
AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT?

15:57.583 --> 15:59.625
JOEY, NOTHING'S
PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE,

15:59.625 --> 16:03.708
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT PARTICULAR SCENARIO
YOU'RE REFERRING TO,

16:03.708 --> 16:09.000
BUT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR
FROM YOUR ATTITUDE THAT
IT'S NOT MEANINGLESS.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.291
AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE,
IF YOU NEED SOMEBODY
TO TALK TO,

16:12.291 --> 16:14.834
TO HELP FIGURE
THINGS OUT WITH IT,

16:14.834 --> 16:17.583
I JUST WANTED TO
TELL YOU THAT I'M HERE.

16:21.125 --> 16:24.125
Mr. McPhee: SO, WHAT
ARE YOU KIDS UP TO?

16:24.125 --> 16:27.291
WHAT DOES IT LOOK
LIKE WE'RE UP TO?

16:27.291 --> 16:27.792
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

16:27.792 --> 16:30.041
ACTUALLY, YES.

16:30.041 --> 16:32.208
WHY DON'T YOU
GO OVER TO JEN'S

16:32.208 --> 16:33.333
WITH A PAIR
OF BINOCULARS

16:33.333 --> 16:35.583
AND SPY ON ANDIE
FOR A WHILE?

16:46.458 --> 16:49.125
GOD.

16:49.125 --> 16:52.500
YOU'D THINK HE'D BE
A LITTLE LESS BLATANT
ABOUT WATCHDOGGING US.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.458
I'M SORRY TO PUT YOU
THROUGH THIS.

16:55.458 --> 16:56.667
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.792
I'VE BEEN THERE AND BACK
WITH MY OWN DAD.

16:58.792 --> 17:00.625
I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.875
HOW THE HELL
DID WE DO THIS WHEN
WE WERE 10 YEARS OLD?

17:06.875 --> 17:08.290
THEN, ALL WE HAD
ON OUR BACKS

17:08.290 --> 17:11.875
WERE A BAG OF CHIPS
AND A COUPLE CAPRI SUNS.

17:11.875 --> 17:14.625
YEAH, I GUESS A LOT'S
CHANGED SINCE THEN.

17:14.625 --> 17:16.750
YEAH, OF COURSE.

17:16.750 --> 17:19.625
BUT CHANGE IS GOOD,
RIGHT?

17:19.625 --> 17:21.125
I MEAN,
CHANGE CAN  BE GOOD.

17:21.125 --> 17:23.708
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
EVEN CHANGE THAT
SEEMS LIKE IT'S BAD

17:23.708 --> 17:24.708
CAN END UP BEING GOOD.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.875
HEY, THERE
IT IS, MAN.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.375
OUR OLD FORT.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.208
FRUIT OF AN ENTIRE
SUMMER'S LABOR.

17:33.208 --> 17:34.291
STILL STANDING.

17:36.875 --> 17:40.000
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S JUST TYPICAL.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
OF WHAT?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.083
OF ME.

17:42.083 --> 17:43.500
I MEAN, EVERYTHING--

17:43.500 --> 17:45.667
THIS FORT,
EVERYTHING WE'VE
SEEN TODAY--

17:45.667 --> 17:48.542
I REMEMBER AS
BEING BIGGER THAN LIFE.

17:48.542 --> 17:50.875
BUT OUT HERE,
IT'S JUST ORDINARY.

17:50.875 --> 17:53.375
MAYBE MY WHOLE LIFE
WAS JUST ORDINARY.

17:54.125 --> 17:57.375
ALL THIS OVER
AN OLD FORT?

17:57.375 --> 17:59.417
WE WERE 9 YEARS OLD WHEN
WE BUILT THIS, DAWSON.

17:59.417 --> 18:00.959
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT,
THE TAJ MAHAL?

18:00.959 --> 18:03.208
OF COURSE NOT
IT'S JUST I...

18:03.208 --> 18:07.750
I DON'T KNOW. RECENTLY
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONNECT
WITH WHO I WAS IN THE PAST,

18:07.750 --> 18:10.708
WHEN I HAD ALL THIS PASSION
AND I KNEW WHO I WAS,

18:10.708 --> 18:14.083
AND THINGS WERE SIMPLE--
MAGICAL, EVEN.

18:14.083 --> 18:15.542
BUT NOW I JUST--

18:17.667 --> 18:19.583
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
I NEVER WAS THAT PERSON.

18:19.583 --> 18:20.959
MAYBE I JUST THOUGHT I WAS.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.792
YOU KNOW WHAT,

18:26.792 --> 18:28.250
IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD
PUT IT THAT WAY

18:28.250 --> 18:30.917
BECAUSE WHAT IT
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE IS--

18:30.917 --> 18:33.250
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER,
YOU KNOW?

18:33.250 --> 18:35.333
AND SO AM I, BECAUSE
JUST THIS MORNING

18:35.333 --> 18:37.875
I WAS SITTIN' OVER BREAKFAST
WITH DEPUTY DOUG AND--

18:37.875 --> 18:40.417
OF ALL PEOPLE TO ASK
FOR AN ANSWER,
BUT YOU KNOW--

18:40.417 --> 18:42.667
SO HE TELLS ME THAT I SHOULD
PROBABLY COME TO YOU

18:42.667 --> 18:45.583
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S GONNA HAVE THE ANSWER
THAT I NEED, SO--

18:45.583 --> 18:47.000
[RUSTLING IN BUSHES]

18:47.000 --> 18:48.458
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

18:48.959 --> 18:51.166
NO. WHAT?

18:56.959 --> 18:59.041
YES! WE FOUND THEM!

18:59.041 --> 19:00.625
HEY! NEAT FORT!

19:10.792 --> 19:13.041
CAN WE TAKE
THIS GUCK OFF NOW?

19:13.041 --> 19:16.583
UGH. I KNOW. I CAN BARELY
MOVE MY CHEEKS.

19:16.583 --> 19:19.208
STILL HAVE 2 1/2
MORE MINUTES.

19:19.208 --> 19:20.792
THIS POPCORN
IS GOOD.

19:20.792 --> 19:23.959
THANKS. IT WAS
MY MOM'S SPECIALTY
WHEN I WAS A KID.

19:23.959 --> 19:26.792
REMINDS ME
OF BEING A CHILD.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.500
DON'T YOU WISH YOU COULD BE
10 YEARS OLD AGAIN?

19:29.500 --> 19:32.959
EVERYTHING WAS SO SIMPLE
AND UNDER CONTROL THEN.

19:32.959 --> 19:35.000
GOD, I FELT SO PROTECTED.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.125
YOU KNOW, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

19:36.125 --> 19:37.166
I MEAN,
I MISS THE TIME

19:37.166 --> 19:38.750
WHEN I COULD JUST
CLIMB THE TREES

19:38.750 --> 19:39.834
AND ROLL AROUND
IN THE MUD

19:39.834 --> 19:40.667
AND HANG OUT
WITH THE BOYS.

19:40.667 --> 19:43.125
IT WAS LIKE
WE WERE THE SAME.

19:43.125 --> 19:46.166
NONE OF THIS STUPID
MAN-WOMAN STUFF
GETTING IN THE WAY.

19:46.166 --> 19:49.834
I FELT FREE TO JUST
BE MYSELF.

19:49.834 --> 19:51.708
I NEVER REALLY
GOT TO BE A LITTLE GIRL.

19:51.708 --> 19:53.708
MY MOM WOULDN'T LET ME
PLAY IN THE DIRT BECAUSE
IT WASN'T PROPER,

19:53.708 --> 19:56.667
AND SHE WOULDN'T LET ME
DRESS UP IN HER HIGH HEELS

19:56.667 --> 19:57.667
BECAUSE THEY WERE
TOO EXPENSIVE.

19:57.667 --> 20:02.125
AND SHE WAS NOT ABOUT
TO LET ME PIG OUT

20:02.125 --> 20:03.500
BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID
I'D GET FAT.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.500
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS EAT ICE CREAM.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.333
EAT ICE CREAM,
PRETEND TO BE A KID,

20:07.333 --> 20:10.166
AND FORGET ABOUT
THOSE STUPID BOYS.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.959
OH, I KNOW.
THEY'RE TWITS. AWFUL.

20:11.959 --> 20:15.458
I MEAN, MAYBE
IT'S GENETIC OR SOMETHING,
BUT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.458
AND THEY LIE.

20:18.458 --> 20:21.041
MMM. THEY MESS
WITH YOUR HEADS.

20:21.041 --> 20:24.333
AND THE WORST IS WHEN
THEY HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU
AND THEY WON'T EVEN ADMIT IT.

20:28.875 --> 20:30.125
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:30.125 --> 20:32.708
I'VE DECIDED
ON MY ACTIVITY.

20:32.708 --> 20:34.041
MY FAVORITE PLACE
AS A KID.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.125
THE ROLLER RINK.

20:36.125 --> 20:39.208
ROLLER SKATING!

20:39.208 --> 20:42.542
GOOD! I THINK THAT
YOUR ACTIVITY CAN
OVERLAP WITH MINE.

20:54.250 --> 20:58.166
UH, MR. McPHEE,
WOULD YOU CARE TO
JOIN US FOR DINNER?

20:58.166 --> 21:00.417
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU BOYS
DON'T MIND,

21:00.417 --> 21:02.583
I'D LOVE THAT.

21:02.583 --> 21:04.041
GREAT.
LET'S GO.

21:04.041 --> 21:05.959
WELL, JUST LET ME
GET A JACKET.

21:05.959 --> 21:07.250
OK.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.041
WHAT?

21:14.375 --> 21:16.208
Pacey: ALL RIGHT,
I TALKED TO
YOUR PARENTS.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.375
THEY SAID
IT'S OK FOR YOU TO
STAY HERE TONIGHT.

21:17.375 --> 21:20.125
Boys: YAY!
Pacey: YAY.

21:20.125 --> 21:21.250
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW,

21:21.250 --> 21:22.583
A 10-YEAR-OLD
WITH A CELL PHONE

21:22.583 --> 21:24.750
IS JUST PLAIN WRONG.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.375
DAWSON WAS GONNA
TELL US A STORY.

21:27.375 --> 21:28.834
THAT'S RIGHT,
THAT'S RIGHT.

21:28.834 --> 21:31.291
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU
A STORY ABOUT
A VERY OLD MAN

21:31.291 --> 21:32.542
WHO WAS VERY RICH
AND DECIDED TO BUILD

21:32.542 --> 21:34.708
A VERY UNUSUAL TYPE
OF AMUSEMENT PARK.

21:34.708 --> 21:37.291
WITH DINOSAURS,
AND THEY CALLED IT
JURASSIC PARK,

21:37.291 --> 21:40.125
AND I'VE SEEN IT
12 TIMES.

21:40.125 --> 21:40.959
TRY AGAIN.

21:40.959 --> 21:41.959
OK.

21:41.959 --> 21:44.000
UH...

21:46.500 --> 21:49.041
ALL RIGHT, THIS
IS A STORY ABOUT
A BOY NAMED ELLIOTT

21:49.041 --> 21:50.792
WHO THOUGHT
HE SAW A GOBLIN IN HIS
TOOL SHED OUT BACK AND--

21:50.792 --> 21:52.917
HEL-LO!

21:52.917 --> 21:54.000
THAT WAS
A MOVIE.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.708
IT'S CALLED
E.T.

21:55.708 --> 21:56.125
OK, A GREAT WHITE SHARK?

21:56.125 --> 21:57.917
All: NO!

21:57.917 --> 22:00.959
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US ONE OF
YOUR  STORIES?

22:00.959 --> 22:02.333
OK.

22:02.333 --> 22:04.917
ALL RIGHT, WELL...

22:04.917 --> 22:08.667
THIS IS A TRUE STORY,
AND PACEY SAID I SHOULDN'T
TELL YOU GUYS,

22:08.667 --> 22:10.500
BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

22:10.500 --> 22:14.458
ACTUALLY, IT TAKES PLACE
IN THE WOODS THAT WE'RE
SITTING IN RIGHT NOW.

22:14.458 --> 22:18.125
IT'S ABOUT AN OLD MAN
WHO ACTUALLY USED TO LIVE
IN THAT FORT RIGHT BACK THERE.

22:18.125 --> 22:21.125
IT USED TO BE HIS HOME.

22:21.125 --> 22:22.500
HIS NAME WAS MAX,

22:22.500 --> 22:25.333
WHICH IS AN ORDINARY
ENOUGH NAME,

22:25.333 --> 22:26.959
BUT MAX IS NOT
AN ORDINARY GUY.

22:26.959 --> 22:29.500
MAX IS EVIL.

22:29.500 --> 22:35.083
NOBODY KNOWS WHY,
BUT HE HATES THINGS
THAT ARE ADORABLE, OR...

22:35.083 --> 22:36.667
KIND, OR EVEN HAPPY.

22:36.667 --> 22:39.500
AND HE WALKS
AROUND THESE WOODS.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.625
HE USED TO BE A LUMBERJACK,
SO HE CARRIES THIS HUGE,
BLOODY AXE.

22:42.625 --> 22:47.166
HE STALKS THE WOODS
KILLING BUNNIES, BIRDS,

22:47.166 --> 22:48.333
WHATEVER
HE CAN COME ACROSS;

22:48.333 --> 22:49.166
BUT HIS FAVORITE TARGET...

22:49.166 --> 22:51.792
IS 9-YEAR-OLDS.

22:53.959 --> 22:56.083
YOU OK, BUZZ?

22:56.083 --> 22:58.291
JUST KEEP GOIN'.

22:58.291 --> 23:05.000
ONE DAY, MAX ARRIVED HOME
TO FIND 3 BOYS SLEEPING
IN HIS HOUSE.

23:06.417 --> 23:09.417
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT
YOU GUYS SAID EARLIER,

23:09.417 --> 23:11.959
ABOUT HOW ALL GUYS
ARE TWITS?

23:11.959 --> 23:13.250
AND I THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT,

23:13.250 --> 23:15.542
BUT I THINK
THERE'S MORE TO IT
THAN THAT BECAUSE...

23:15.542 --> 23:19.125
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW
WHEN THEY GIVE YOU
THAT CERTAIN LOOK?

23:19.125 --> 23:20.500
YOU KNOW, THAT LOOK
THAT SAYS

23:20.500 --> 23:23.208
YOU ARE EXACTLY
WHERE THEY WANT
TO BE RIGHT NOW.

23:23.208 --> 23:25.208
AND YOU FEEL IT
FOR THEM, TOO.

23:25.208 --> 23:29.708
AND THEN YOU JUST MELT LIKE
THIS BIG BLOB OF ICE CREAM,

23:29.708 --> 23:31.417
EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO.

23:31.417 --> 23:34.375
PACEY USED TO DO THAT
TO ME ALL THE TIME.

23:34.375 --> 23:36.625
RIGHT BEFORE HE KISSED ME.

23:36.625 --> 23:39.125
MADE MY KNEES WEAK.

23:39.125 --> 23:42.208
HENRY'S GOT
A LOOK LIKE THAT.

23:42.208 --> 23:43.542
DOES IT TO ME
EVERY TIME.

23:46.667 --> 23:47.750
WHOA!

23:50.250 --> 23:52.917
OK, WHO WANTS
TO GO AGAIN?

23:52.917 --> 23:54.125
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

23:54.125 --> 23:55.250
I'M GONNA TAKE
A BREAK.

23:55.250 --> 23:56.333
OK. COME ON, JOEY.

23:56.333 --> 23:58.834
OK.
LET'S GO.

23:58.834 --> 23:59.875
BYE.

23:59.875 --> 24:01.375
BYE.

24:08.417 --> 24:09.583
[CHANTING]
HENRY, HENRY, HENRY!

24:12.333 --> 24:15.917
[CHANTING]
HENRY, HENRY, HENRY!

24:20.458 --> 24:21.667
Jen: HENRY?

24:31.667 --> 24:32.708
HI.

24:40.125 --> 24:42.667
Ethan: YOU HAD
A '57 FORD
THUNDERBIRD?

24:42.667 --> 24:44.875
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THAT'S MY DREAM CAR.

24:44.875 --> 24:47.834
LET ME TELL YOU,
IT DROVE LIKE
A DREAM, TOO.

24:47.834 --> 24:50.667
MINT CONDITION.
CHERRY RED,
BLACK INTERIOR,

24:50.667 --> 24:53.625
8 CYLINDERS,
3 SPEEDS,
CONVERTIBLE.

24:53.625 --> 24:56.041
JACK, DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT PHOTOGRAPH
YOUR MOTHER TOOK

24:56.041 --> 24:56.959
OF THE TWO OF US
ON THE BUMPER

24:56.959 --> 24:59.250
WHEN YOU WERE
JUST A BABY?

24:59.250 --> 25:00.625
I GUESS I
BLOCKED IT OUT.

25:02.834 --> 25:03.917
WHY'D YOU
GET RID OF IT?

25:03.917 --> 25:07.417
OH, YOU KNOW.
KIDS AND EVERYTHING--

25:07.417 --> 25:09.291
WAS IMPRACTICAL.

25:09.291 --> 25:10.208
BUT I LOVED THAT CAR.

25:10.208 --> 25:12.250
I CRIED WHEN
I TRADED IT IN.

25:12.250 --> 25:13.708
TEARS.

25:13.708 --> 25:16.125
OH, MAN.
I CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT.

25:16.125 --> 25:17.500
ME NEITHER.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.500
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT IN YEARS.

25:19.500 --> 25:23.834
JACK USED TO BEG ME
TO TAKE HIM FOR RIDES IN IT.

25:23.834 --> 25:24.542
YOU REMEMBER THAT CAR, JACK?

25:24.542 --> 25:27.917
I THINK I ALREADY SAID NO.

25:28.625 --> 25:30.583
RIGHT.

25:32.500 --> 25:33.875
THERE'S A CLASSIC CAR
MUSEUM

25:33.875 --> 25:35.125
JUST DOWN THE ROAD,

25:35.125 --> 25:36.375
STAY OPEN LATE
ON WEEKENDS.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.542
THEY'VE GOT
A 1926 CADILLAC.

25:38.542 --> 25:39.834
BLOW YOUR MIND, ETHAN.

25:39.834 --> 25:41.583
SOUNDS GREAT.

25:41.583 --> 25:42.000
JACK?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.708
GREAT.

25:47.458 --> 25:48.708
[SHOVEL DIGGING INTO DIRT]

25:53.166 --> 25:55.291
[SHOVEL STRIKES SOMETHING]

26:10.667 --> 26:12.208
DAWSON.

26:12.208 --> 26:13.834
HEY, CHECK IT OUT, MAN.

26:17.542 --> 26:20.333
OH, MY GOD,
I COMPLETELY
FORGOT ABOUT THIS.

26:23.667 --> 26:25.583
THIS IS...

26:27.250 --> 26:29.708
OK, THE TICKET STUB
FROM THE FIRST TIME
I SAW JURASSIC PARK.

26:29.708 --> 26:33.792
AND THE SECOND,
AND THE THIRD.

26:33.792 --> 26:34.917
THAT'S JUST SAD, MAN.

26:34.917 --> 26:36.875
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

26:36.875 --> 26:38.041
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

26:38.041 --> 26:41.959
IT'S DEPUTY DOUG'S
POCKET KNIFE.

26:41.959 --> 26:43.083
YOU KNOW, MY DAD
NEVER FOUND THE EVIDENCE,

26:43.083 --> 26:45.834
BUT HE STILL GAVE ME
THE SPANKING OF A LIFETIME.

26:45.834 --> 26:46.750
GO FIGURE.

26:46.750 --> 26:49.333
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THIS.

26:50.625 --> 26:52.959
IT'S A PICTURE OF ME
AND LITTLE JOEY POTTER.

26:55.125 --> 26:57.417
LOOK AT HOW BEAUTIFUL
SHE WAS, EVEN THEN.

26:57.417 --> 26:59.041
WE HAD NO IDEA.

26:59.041 --> 27:03.542
WE MUST HAVE BEEN DEAF, DUMB,
AND BLIND NOT TO NOTICE.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.417
WHAT'S THIS?

27:06.417 --> 27:08.333
"THE SECRET CODE
OF PACEY WITTER
AND DAWSON LEERY."

27:08.333 --> 27:11.583
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?
YOU DREW THIS UP
THE DAY THAT--

27:11.583 --> 27:13.291
THE DAY THAT WE BECAME
BLOOD BROTHERS.

27:13.291 --> 27:14.583
YEAH.

27:16.291 --> 27:18.208
IT'S OUR
OATH OF LOYALTY.

27:18.208 --> 27:19.250
YEAH.

27:19.250 --> 27:22.083
GOD, THIS IS GREAT.
I CAN'T--

27:22.083 --> 27:24.375
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FOUND THIS.

27:24.375 --> 27:26.083
IT'S SO--
ISN'T IT WEIRD HOW
YOU CAN JUST...

27:26.083 --> 27:27.959
PUT YOUR FRIENDSHIP
WITH SOMEBODY IN A BOX,

27:27.959 --> 27:30.750
BURY IT, AND COMPLETELY
FORGET ABOUT IT?

27:34.834 --> 27:35.875
YEAH.

27:43.959 --> 27:45.583
AGAIN, LET ME
JUST ASSURE YOU

27:45.583 --> 27:47.208
THAT THIS
IS A PURE COINCIDENCE.

27:47.208 --> 27:48.458
I AM NOT
CRASHING YOUR PARTY,

27:48.458 --> 27:50.250
AND YOUR MOM INSISTED
THAT WE STAY,

27:50.250 --> 27:51.792
AND THAT'S
THE ONLY REASON.

27:51.792 --> 27:53.625
SO YOU CAN STOP
BEING MAD.

27:53.625 --> 27:57.000
I'M NOT MAD.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.291
HUMILIATED, MAYBE,
BUT NOT MAD.

27:59.291 --> 28:00.458
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

28:00.458 --> 28:02.625
FIRST YOU LIE TO ME
ABOUT THIS PARTY,

28:02.625 --> 28:04.667
THEN YOU HURT MY FEELINGS
BY NOT INVITING ME,

28:04.667 --> 28:08.166
AND THEN I ACCIDENTLY
SHOW UP ANYWAY,
WEARING THIS?

28:08.166 --> 28:09.500
AND YOU'RE  HUMILIATED?

28:09.500 --> 28:11.500
CAN YOU BLAME ME?

28:11.500 --> 28:13.834
LOOK AROUND, JEN.
THIS PLACE IS FIT
FOR A 6-YEAR OLD.

28:16.041 --> 28:18.333
I TOLD MY MOM
I'D DO IT
THIS LAST TIME.

28:18.333 --> 28:19.917
HOW COULD I
HAVE BROUGHT YOU?

28:19.917 --> 28:21.834
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
POSSIBLY UNDERSTOOD.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.500
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL
UNDERSTAND UNLESS YOU TELL ME?

28:24.500 --> 28:28.375
IT'S BEEN HARD ENOUGH
TRYING TO GET YOU TO
STOP THINKING OF ME

28:28.375 --> 28:29.792
AS AN INNOCENT
LITTLE KID.

28:29.792 --> 28:33.667
THEN WHAT--
BRING YOU TO THIS?

28:33.667 --> 28:34.834
COME ON.

28:34.834 --> 28:38.333
HENRY, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS?

28:38.333 --> 28:41.250
YOUR INNOCENCE IS ONE OF
THE BEST THINGS ABOUT YOU.

28:41.250 --> 28:44.250
IT'S HELPING ME FIND
THE SAME THING WITHIN MYSELF.

28:44.250 --> 28:47.375
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE
WHO YOU ARE.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.375
NOT FROM ME.

28:50.458 --> 28:54.041
SO ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU FORGIVE ME?

28:54.041 --> 28:57.959
I'M SAYING
I DON'T LIKE BEING LIED TO.

28:58.583 --> 29:01.333
NO. I'M SORRY.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.959
I UNDERSTAND IF YOU
NEVER WANT TO SPEAK
TO ME AGAIN.

29:06.458 --> 29:07.708
SO DRAMATIC.

29:07.708 --> 29:10.208
COME BACK HERE,
PARKER!

29:17.417 --> 29:21.625
YOU KNOW, BY THE WAY,
YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT
WOULD HAVE BEEN

29:21.625 --> 29:23.083
A COPY OF BORN TO RUN.

29:23.083 --> 29:25.417
MINT CONDITION,
ON VINYL.

29:25.417 --> 29:28.583
WOULD HAVE BEEN?

29:29.125 --> 29:31.250
WELL, I--I--I--

29:31.250 --> 29:33.500
I SORT OF SOLD IT BACK
TO THE RECORD STORE

29:33.500 --> 29:36.333
AND BOUGHT SOME
ANGRY CHICK MUSIC.

29:38.041 --> 29:40.583
I GUESS IT'S
THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS.

29:40.583 --> 29:43.792
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

29:46.875 --> 29:48.667
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HENRY.

29:52.250 --> 29:53.333
COME ON.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.875
THE BEAUTY OF THE OLD CARS
IS THE SIMPLICITY.

29:55.875 --> 29:58.458
EVERYTHING'S RIGHT HERE.
THERE'S NOTHING AUTOMATIC.

29:58.458 --> 29:59.792
YOU HAVE TO PRIME THIS--

29:59.792 --> 30:02.166
CAN I, LIKE, TALK TO YOU
OVER HERE FOR
A MOMENT, PLEASE?

30:02.166 --> 30:03.125
SURE.

30:09.792 --> 30:11.417
WHAT'S UP?

30:11.417 --> 30:14.125
WHAT'S UP IS THAT
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO COME AND VISIT

30:14.125 --> 30:15.750
SO WE COULD HANG OUT
WITH MY DAD,

30:15.750 --> 30:19.458
WHO HATES ME, OK?
AND DOESN'T EVEN TRY
TO UNDERSTAND ME.

30:19.458 --> 30:21.041
WHO CAN CRY TEARS
OVER A STUPID CAR,

30:21.041 --> 30:23.750
BUT CAN'T MUSTER UP
A SHRED OF EMOTION
FOR HIS OWN SON.

30:23.750 --> 30:27.125
NO, NO. HE STOPPED
BEING MY FATHER
A LONG TIME AGO, ETHAN.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.125
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
SOME EXCRUCIATING
EVENING

30:29.125 --> 30:30.875
BEING REMINDED OF THAT.
I MEAN, COME ON.

30:30.875 --> 30:31.959
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

30:31.959 --> 30:34.208
JACK, CALM DOWN.
I MEAN--

30:34.208 --> 30:38.333
BOYS, I'M GONNA HEAD BACK.
YOU CAN GET HOME OK?

30:38.333 --> 30:39.000
YES.

30:48.375 --> 30:50.834
YOU KNOW,
I REALLY THOUGHT THINGS
WERE GETTING BETTER.

30:50.834 --> 30:54.166
I WAS SO GRATEFUL
FOR TONIGHT.

30:54.166 --> 30:57.000
I CANCELED
MY BUSINESS TRIP
THIS WEEKEND

30:57.000 --> 30:59.041
TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

30:59.041 --> 31:01.291
I GUESS I'M JUST
NOT THE FATHER
YOU WANT...

31:01.291 --> 31:03.458
OR NEED.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.417
Dawson:
PACE, YOU AWAKE?

31:16.417 --> 31:19.083
WIDE AWAKE. YES.

31:21.041 --> 31:22.750
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

31:22.750 --> 31:27.458
IT FINALLY OCCURRED TO ME
WHAT IN MY LIFE HASN'T
LOST ITS LUSTER WITH TIME.

31:27.458 --> 31:30.333
MY FRIENDSHIPS.

31:30.333 --> 31:32.750
YOU KNOW, I MIGHT BE UNSURE
OF A LOT OF THINGS IN MY LIFE,

31:32.750 --> 31:34.959
BUT I'M ALWAYS GONNA BE
SURE OF YOU...

31:34.959 --> 31:37.583
AND JOEY.

31:37.583 --> 31:40.708
ME AND JOEY, HUH?

31:40.708 --> 31:42.333
YEAH.

31:42.333 --> 31:43.750
I MEAN, YOU--
YOU'RE...

31:43.750 --> 31:45.625
YOU'RE PURE LOYALTY.

31:45.625 --> 31:49.875
YOU'RE STILL THE GUY
WHO DREW UP THAT OATH
WE TOOK WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

31:49.875 --> 31:52.041
STILL THE GUY WHO'D DO
ANYTHING FOR A FRIEND.

31:52.041 --> 31:53.417
AND JOEY?

31:53.417 --> 31:55.750
JOEY?

31:55.750 --> 31:58.417
SHE'S MY CONSCIENCE.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.750
MY SOUL MATE.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.708
MY INSPIRATION.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.750
THE POINT IS,

32:07.750 --> 32:09.834
I'M REALLY GLAD TO HAVE
YOU GUYS IN MY LIFE.

32:09.834 --> 32:11.583
I'D BE LOST WITHOUT YOU.

32:18.250 --> 32:21.417
YOU KNOW,
IF I'M LOYALTY, DAWSON,

32:21.417 --> 32:24.417
IT'S ONLY 'CAUSE
YOU CAST ME IN THE ROLE.

32:24.417 --> 32:26.500
YOU'RE THE STORYTELLER,
YOU KNOW?

32:26.500 --> 32:30.125
YOU SEE EVERYTHING
AND FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT MEANS.

32:30.125 --> 32:32.708
DID YOU SEE THE LOOK
ON THOSE KIDS' FACES

32:32.708 --> 32:33.917
WHILE YOU WERE TELLING THEM
THAT STORY TONIGHT?

32:33.917 --> 32:36.250
HOW CAUGHT UP THEY WERE?

32:36.250 --> 32:39.625
YOU'RE THE GUY
WHO BUILDS
THIS FANTASTIC WORLD.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.959
YOU JUST LET THE REST
OF US LIVE IN IT.

32:42.959 --> 32:46.250
THESE DAYS, IT DOESN'T FEEL
SO FANTASTIC.

32:46.250 --> 32:48.417
IT WILL, BRO.

33:05.041 --> 33:06.291
GOOD NIGHT.

33:06.291 --> 33:07.959
HOLD UP.

33:07.959 --> 33:10.375
DON'T YOU THINK
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT?

33:10.375 --> 33:12.750
ACTUALLY, I'D LIKE TO PRETEND
IT'S ALL A BAD DREAM.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.625
WELL, THAT WOULD BE
A MISTAKE, JACK.

33:14.625 --> 33:19.417
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE MAD AT ME,
BUT DON'T BE.

33:19.417 --> 33:20.583
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP.

33:20.583 --> 33:22.792
NO. I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

33:22.792 --> 33:26.208
I'M JUST--
I'M JUST MAD.

33:27.333 --> 33:31.291
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, TONIGHT...

33:31.291 --> 33:33.333
TONIGHT HE JUST SOMEHOW
MANAGED TO MAKE IT LOOK

33:33.333 --> 33:34.500
LIKE HE WAS THE VICTIM
IN THIS WHOLE THING

33:34.500 --> 33:39.458
AND LIKE I WAS SOME KIND
OF MALICIOUS OGRE,

33:39.458 --> 33:39.875
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

33:39.875 --> 33:41.875
GOD, JACK.

33:41.875 --> 33:44.417
DON'T YOU GET IT?
YOU'RE BOTH VICTIMS
HERE.

33:44.417 --> 33:46.417
AND IT'S NOT GONNA
GET ANY BETTER

33:46.417 --> 33:48.500
UNLESS YOU START
LETTING GO SOME
OF THAT ANGER.

33:48.500 --> 33:52.625
YEAH, BUT HE'S THE ONE
WHO DID THIS TO ME.

33:52.625 --> 33:54.917
OK? HE'S THE ONE
WHO MADE ME THIS ANGRY.

33:54.917 --> 33:57.500
A YEAR, ETHAN.
A WHOLE YEAR HE SPENDS
WALKING AROUND

33:57.500 --> 34:00.625
LIKE I'M THE WORST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO HIM.

34:00.625 --> 34:03.500
AND HE CANCELS ONE TRIP SO HE
CAN PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVELY THROW
IT BACK INTO MY FACE,

34:03.500 --> 34:07.041
AND EVERYTHING'S SUPPOSED TO
MAGICALLY FALL BACK INTO PLACE?

34:07.041 --> 34:09.000
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

34:11.291 --> 34:15.125
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
HOW IT DOES WORK, JACK.

34:15.125 --> 34:17.917
YOU KEEP WALKING AROUND
WITH ALL THAT ANGER,

34:17.917 --> 34:19.875
YOU AND YOUR DAD
ARE GONNA LOSE
ANOTHER YEAR...

34:19.875 --> 34:22.375
AND ANOTHER ONE.

34:22.375 --> 34:24.291
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP
ONE MORNING

34:24.291 --> 34:27.083
AND REALIZE THAT YOU
NEED HIM...

34:27.708 --> 34:29.792
OR HE NEEDS YOU...

34:29.792 --> 34:32.083
BUT IT'S GONNA BE
TOO LATE.

34:35.041 --> 34:38.833
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER
NICE SIDE EFFECT OF
LETTING GO OF YOUR ANGER

34:38.833 --> 34:42.125
IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE ANGRY ANYMORE.

34:46.542 --> 34:49.291
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

34:51.708 --> 34:52.792
GOOD NIGHT, JACK.

34:56.625 --> 34:57.959
GOOD NIGHT.

35:19.834 --> 35:21.500
WEIRD NIGHT, HUH?

35:23.041 --> 35:23.417
YEAH, I'D SAY.

35:27.333 --> 35:31.000
I WAS TALKING TO BESSIE
THE OTHER DAY AND...

35:31.000 --> 35:32.417
SHE TOLD ME TO TALK TO
SOMEBODY ABOUT THIS AND...

35:32.417 --> 35:35.750
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M TELLING YOU, BUT...

35:41.417 --> 35:43.792
PACEY KISSED ME
THE OTHER DAY.

35:43.792 --> 35:46.708
YEAH, I FIGURED THIS
THING WOULD COME TO
A HEAD SOONER OR LATER.

35:46.708 --> 35:50.125
NOTHING CAME TO A HEAD.
I MEAN, THERE IS NO THING. IT--

35:50.125 --> 35:51.917
I'M JUST FREAKED OUT
AND ANGRY,

35:51.917 --> 35:54.542
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HE WOULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

35:54.542 --> 35:57.125
I MEAN, IT CAME OUT
OF NOWHERE, AND...

35:57.125 --> 35:59.917
WELL, IF IT CAME OUT
OF NOWHERE,

35:59.917 --> 36:01.750
THEN HOW COME
I'M NOT SURPRISED?

36:03.583 --> 36:05.959
YOU SHOULD ASK
YOURSELF, JOEY,

36:05.959 --> 36:08.875
IF THIS IS REALLY
NOTHING...

36:08.875 --> 36:12.458
THEN WHY ARE YOU
SO UPSET
AND SO CONFUSED?

36:29.875 --> 36:32.000
IT'S LATE.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.917
WHAT IS IT?

36:35.458 --> 36:36.333
YEAH, I JUST, UM...

36:42.000 --> 36:43.458
I JUST WANTED TO
ASK YOU WHY...

36:46.458 --> 36:50.417
WHY THIS WEEKEND,
WHY THIS TRIP,
WHY NOW?

36:50.417 --> 36:53.875
WHEN FOR THE PAST YEAR
YOU'VE TREATED ME
LIKE I WAS A LEPER.

36:57.125 --> 36:58.875
ANSWER ME THAT, WHY?

37:15.417 --> 37:17.834
IT WAS JUST...

37:17.834 --> 37:19.125
TIME.

37:21.250 --> 37:23.583
I WAS TALKING TO RICHARD
AT THE OFFICE.

37:23.583 --> 37:28.375
HE HAS A SON JUST FAILED
OUT OF HIS FOURTH COLLEGE,

37:28.375 --> 37:31.708
GOT CAUGHT STEALING A CAR,
DRUG PROB--WHOLE NINE YARDS.

37:34.166 --> 37:37.250
IT JUST SUDDENLY
OCCURRED TO ME...

37:37.250 --> 37:39.542
JACK IS A GOOD KID.

37:42.583 --> 37:47.500
I HAVE A GOOD KID,
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

37:51.041 --> 37:54.125
BUT I WANT TO KNOW HIM.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.417
SO I CANCELED MY TRIP.

38:01.667 --> 38:04.667
LOOK, I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

38:04.667 --> 38:06.417
SOMEBODY HAD TO MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE.

38:08.583 --> 38:11.250
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD BE YOU.

38:45.959 --> 38:47.291
I'LL TALK TO YOU
LATER, HUH?

38:47.291 --> 38:48.291
ALRIGHT, I'LL SEE YA.

38:48.291 --> 38:49.500
LET'S GO, GUYS.

38:55.083 --> 38:58.708
BYE, DAWSON.
WATCH OUT FOR MAX
AND HIS BLOODY AXE.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.542
SEE YOU GUYS.

39:15.041 --> 39:18.792
I'M GONNA GET
12 PIXIE STICKS
AND 5 CANDY BARS.

39:18.792 --> 39:23.917
HOW ABOUT AN ORANGE SODA
AND A BOX OF PRETZELS?

39:23.917 --> 39:28.750
ONE PIXIE STICK,
ONE CANDY BAR,
AND AN ORANGE SODA.

39:28.750 --> 39:29.875
HEY.

39:29.875 --> 39:31.375
HEY.

39:31.959 --> 39:33.041
HEY.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.166
JUST A SECOND.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.125
LISTEN, IF YOU'LL
GIVE US 2 MINUTES,

39:38.125 --> 39:39.875
I'LL GIVE YOU 10 SODAS
AND A BOX OF SUGAR.
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

39:39.875 --> 39:40.917
DONE.

39:40.917 --> 39:43.166
THERE YOU GO.

39:49.166 --> 39:49.667
HEY.

39:51.083 --> 39:53.166
HEY AGAIN.

39:53.166 --> 39:55.291
SO I GUESS I--
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT--

39:58.417 --> 39:59.834
YOU GO FIRST.

39:59.834 --> 40:05.041
WELL, UH, I JUST--
I--I WANTED TO...

40:05.041 --> 40:09.417
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT, UH...

40:09.417 --> 40:10.750
I'M SORRY.

40:10.750 --> 40:13.542
YOU KNOW, ALL THAT STUFF
ABOUT DISASTER AND DAWSON

40:13.542 --> 40:16.834
AND THE RIPPLE EFFECT
IN OUR UNIVERSE,

40:16.834 --> 40:18.250
IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.917
I MEAN, WHAT I DID, THAT
WAS JUST MONUMENTALLY STUPID.

40:20.917 --> 40:21.917
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I
WAS THINKING,

40:21.917 --> 40:23.959
SO...I JUST WANTED
YOU TO KNOW

40:23.959 --> 40:25.875
IT WAS AN IMPULSE,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

40:25.875 --> 40:27.750
ONE'S THAT
LEFT MY BODY.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.458
PERMANENTLY.

40:29.458 --> 40:30.583
I PROMISE.

40:30.583 --> 40:33.250
IT'S OK, PACEY. I MEAN...

40:33.250 --> 40:36.667
I TOTALLY OVERREACTED.

40:36.667 --> 40:39.417
I MEAN SOMETHING
ISN'T A BIG DEAL
UNLESS YOU LET IT BE.

40:39.417 --> 40:43.166
AND--AND IT...
YOU KNOW, IT'S--
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

40:43.166 --> 40:45.375
WHY GET SO UPSET?

40:45.375 --> 40:50.708
I MEAN, IT OBVIOUSLY MEANT
N-NOTHING. RIGHT?

40:51.917 --> 40:53.166
RIGHT.

40:53.166 --> 40:56.500
RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT I DID
WAS A MISTAKE.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.959
RIGHT.

40:57.959 --> 40:59.375
RIGHT. WELL, UH...

40:59.375 --> 41:04.458
I GUESS THAT
PUTS US BACK TO
JUST BEING FRIENDS.

41:05.208 --> 41:07.041
DEFINITELY.

41:07.041 --> 41:08.250
GREAT.

41:08.250 --> 41:12.625
UH...ALL RIGHT.

41:12.625 --> 41:13.667
WELL, UH...

41:13.667 --> 41:15.625
YEAH, I SHOULD
PROBABLY GET GOING.

41:15.625 --> 41:17.792
ONCE THAT KID GETS
ALL THAT SUGAR IN HIM,
WATCH OUT.

41:17.792 --> 41:20.458
HE'S A LITTLE TERROR.
I'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO
CHASE HIM BACK HOME.

41:20.458 --> 41:22.166
IT'S 2 MILES.
NOT PRETTY.

41:22.166 --> 41:24.959
WELL, THEN I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, PACEY.

41:24.959 --> 41:26.667
YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU
LATER, JO.

41:43.625 --> 41:45.333
YOU GRAB THE FRONT,
I'LL GRAB THE BACK?

41:45.333 --> 41:46.875
1, 2, 3...

41:46.875 --> 41:47.959
GRAB IT.

41:48.875 --> 41:49.959
THERE YOU GO.

41:51.083 --> 41:52.333
IS THAT HER?

41:52.333 --> 41:53.333
WHO?

41:53.333 --> 41:54.834
THE GIRL.

41:54.834 --> 41:55.708
WHAT GIRL?

41:55.708 --> 41:58.333
THE GIRL YOU WANT
TO KISS, STUPID.

41:58.333 --> 41:59.750
THE ONE YOU'RE
IN LOVE  WITH.

41:59.750 --> 42:00.750
NOPE.
