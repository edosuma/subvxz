taking them.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.500

08:31.584 --> 08:33.542
I want to make
a formal apology...

08:33.625 --> 08:36.208
- Okay. Thank you.
- About last night, and...

08:36.292 --> 08:37.584
everything, really.

08:37.667 --> 08:38.876
I feel like you and I

08:38.959 --> 08:40.542
just got off on the wrong foot.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.001
- I mean, was there
a right foot?

08:42.084 --> 08:45.834
Because honestly, you came
in someone else's place.

08:45.917 --> 08:48.667
- Well, technically
it was Miguel's invitation,

08:48.750 --> 08:52.333
and his plus-one could be
anyone of his choosing, so--

08:52.417 --> 08:54.876
but I don't want to argue
about that stuff.

08:54.959 --> 08:57.167
Because I know

08:57.250 --> 09:01.042
that this has been
a really intense time for you.

09:01.126 --> 09:02.792
- It has. Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.167
- It has.
It's been very intense.

09:05.250 --> 09:07.208
But honestly,
when isn't it intense?

09:07.292 --> 09:08.584
It's intense to be me,

09:08.667 --> 09:12.001
and that seems to really
rub people the wrong way.

09:12.084 --> 09:13.625
I don't know
if you get this,

09:13.709 --> 09:16.417
but friends scatter
after an illness.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.584
- Mm.

09:17.667 --> 09:18.750
- It's too real for them.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.208
They shrink in the face of it.

09:22.458 --> 09:24.876

09:44.084 --> 09:45.542
It's Lyme season.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.959

I mean, it's silly.

09:58.126 --> 09:59.292

got off the trail

17:12.458 --> 17:15.001
- And Craysia was
never really normal.

17:15.084 --> 17:16.417
I mean, whatever "normal"
means.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.458
- Yeah.

17:17.542 --> 17:19.375
- And I was the younger sister

17:19.458 --> 17:21.250
who had to be the big sister,
like you.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.750
- The oldest story in the book.
- And it hurts.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.625
- Yeah.
- I mean, it hurts, doesn't it?

17:25.709 --> 17:28.959
I mean, to not have
the compassion and the care

17:29.042 --> 17:33.584
and that focus that only
a big sister can bring.

17:33.667 --> 17:35.750
- I--I have never
thought of it that way.

17:35.834 --> 17:37.584
I was always just like,
"Hey, Carleen,

17:37.667 --> 17:39.542
great drawing of a horse."

17:39.625 --> 17:40.834
But our mom babied her.

17:40.917 --> 17:42.834
She always let her have
porridge for dinner.

17:42.917 --> 17:45.292
She didn't baby me.
She said I was the tough one.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.667
If I wanted my favorite dinner,
she'd say,

17:47.750 --> 17:50.667
"You get what you get
and you don't get upset."

17:50.750 --> 17:52.959
- And what did you want
for dinner?

17:53.042 --> 17:55.250
- Oh.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.084
Honestly...

17:57.167 --> 17:59.126
raisins.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.959
A big bowl full of raisins.

18:01.042 --> 18:02.750
[chuckles]

18:02.834 --> 18:05.042
They're still
my guilty pleasure.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.834

18:07.917 --> 18:09.417
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.667

18:10.750 --> 18:13.375
- I don't think
we're on the trail anymore.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.959
- Uh, okay.
How did that happen?

18:16.042 --> 18:18.250
- I don't know.
- [laughs]

18:18.333 --> 18:20.042
- I think I stopped
paying attention.

18:20.126 --> 18:23.375
- Yeah, just two girls
talking and walking

18:23.458 --> 18:24.667

18:48.333 --> 18:49.709
- What do you want to sing?

18:49.792 --> 18:50.750
- Fleetwood Mac?

21:28.667 --> 21:30.584
- Huh.
- And I crave it, you know?

Wednesday, Friday,

21:43.292 --> 21:45.375

21:45.458 --> 21:47.876
but other than that
we're really independent.

21:47.959 --> 21:49.458
- Me and Craysia haven't talked

21:49.542 --> 21:51.292

I mean, not by choice,
of course.

21:53.084 --> 21:55.834

no reliable internet.

of releasing primal urges.

22:26.709 --> 22:27.709
- Oh, yeah.

22:27.792 --> 22:28.750
- Manners have no place

22:28.834 --> 22:30.042
in healing.

22:30.126 --> 22:31.750
- I was taught
manners will open a door,

22:31.834 --> 22:33.458
but smarts'll keep 'em propped.

22:33.542 --> 22:35.876
- I don't have any idea
what that means,

22:35.959 --> 22:37.375
but I'm thinking

22:37.458 --> 22:40.333
one of the huge issues
you're having

22:40.417 --> 22:41.625
with your health

22:41.709 --> 22:44.625
is your sexual energy
is stagnated.

22:44.709 --> 22:47.709
- Yeah, well,
I have a burning urethra

22:47.792 --> 22:50.084
and disease
in my Douglas' pouch,

22:50.167 --> 22:52.042
so...yeah.

22:52.126 --> 22:54.333
- Okay, think of your pelvis

22:54.417 --> 22:56.458
as a bowl of water.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.126
- In reality it's more
of a trampoline

22:58.208 --> 22:59.542
of muscle flesh.

22:59.625 --> 23:02.292
- Okay, you're gonna want Walt

23:02.375 --> 23:04.959
to bounce on that.

23:08.001 --> 23:10.208
- What if I don't want
to have sex with Walt?

23:10.292 --> 23:11.542
- That's amazing.

23:11.625 --> 23:13.792
You just fuck someone
you're attracted to.

23:13.876 --> 23:16.250

23:16.333 --> 23:17.167
- What!

- Oh, my God,

23:18.500 --> 23:19.876
we're gonna break up
in a week.

23:19.959 --> 23:22.500

way too fast for me.

23:22.584 --> 23:24.042
We're not even
on the same page anymore.

23:24.126 --> 23:26.417

attracted to Miguel.

23:34.084 --> 23:35.709
You're gonna want to get
into that.

23:35.792 --> 23:38.625
Plus, you wouldn't have reacted
to me the way you did

of sexual obsession

23:40.584 --> 23:42.126

And I'm here to tell you,
you can act on those urges.

23:45.959 --> 23:47.167
You should.
- No.

23:47.250 --> 23:48.792
No, you--you don't know me.

23:48.876 --> 23:51.584
I do not like Miguel,
I am not attracted to Miguel,

23:51.667 --> 23:54.001
and actually,
anyone who does like him

23:54.084 --> 23:56.625
is probably
a full-fledged idiot.

23:56.709 --> 23:58.458
- I'm not gonna take that
personally.

23:58.542 --> 24:01.500
I'm gonna kiss that comment
good-bye. [chuckles]

on the level.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.959

to convince me

24:20.042 --> 24:21.792
to have sex with
my husband's best friend,

24:21.876 --> 24:22.917
whose home you already wrecked.

24:23.001 --> 24:24.333
- Margaret cheated on him.

24:24.417 --> 24:25.917
- Yeah, well, they might have
been able to fix it

24:26.001 --> 24:27.542
if you hadn't been
tossing your hair everywhere.

24:27.625 --> 24:28.917

it's their dad's time.

to Hawaiian culture

- Actually, Sol,
it's pretty shitty, yeah.

25:54.250 --> 25:55.917
- We weren't able
to locate her.

25:56.001 --> 25:58.458
- But this bootie tells us
that she's in the woods.

25:58.542 --> 26:00.208
- Or was.
Is or was.

26:02.001 --> 26:03.208
- Okay.
- Dad!

26:03.292 --> 26:04.959
You're such a soulless
piece of shit.

26:05.042 --> 26:07.333
I mean, can you open
your fucking eyes?

26:07.417 --> 26:09.126
Carleen is not even--

26:10.292 --> 26:11.417
- [sobbing]

26:11.500 --> 26:13.417
- What's happening?
Oh, my God.

26:13.500 --> 26:16.042
- [sobs]
We have to find her!

26:16.126 --> 26:17.959
- Dad--
- Carleen!

26:18.042 --> 26:19.876
Carleen!
- Dad!

26:19.959 --> 26:22.417
- Carleen!
- Dad, calm down!

26:22.500 --> 26:23.917
- I know the feeling, sir.

26:24.001 --> 26:25.001
- [faint shouting]
Carleen!

26:25.084 --> 26:27.750
- I know it well.

26:30.542 --> 26:31.917
- Okay.

26:32.001 --> 26:36.084
Well, we should be able
to make our way back from here.

26:36.167 --> 26:37.625
- Oh, are you fucking serious?

26:37.709 --> 26:39.959
- Oh, we're gonna walk?

26:40.042 --> 26:41.208
- Yep.

26:41.292 --> 26:42.584
- You don't even know
your way back.

26:42.667 --> 26:43.834
- I'll figure it out.

26:43.917 --> 26:45.458
By the way,
please don't speak to me

26:45.542 --> 26:46.625
the remainder of the trip.

26:46.709 --> 26:48.167
Thanks in advance.
- Fine!

26:48.250 --> 26:50.959
But you're missing the best
friendship of your life.

26:51.042 --> 26:54.126
And you're never gonna
have it.

26:54.208 --> 26:56.375
Hi, I'm Jandice.

27:04.001 --> 27:07.792
The campsite's back this way,
asshole!

Guys, it's Walt's birthday.

28:48.042 --> 28:49.333
Can everyone go get changed?

28:49.500 --> 28:51.375
From one pair of shorts
to another pair of shorts?

28:51.458 --> 28:52.876
Did you not read
in the packing guide

28:52.959 --> 28:54.625
where it said, "festive garb?"

28:55.917 --> 28:57.709
-Hi!
-Carleen! You're alive!

28:57.792 --> 28:59.333
I got so lost.

28:59.417 --> 29:02.375
-Girl, everyone came
to look for you.
-We did.

29:02.458 --> 29:03.917
I mean, I didn't.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.584
What would make you all
have some fun?

29:06.667 --> 29:08.417
Let's do drugs.

29:09.084 --> 29:11.001
Sure. This night
couldn't get any worse.

29:11.792 --> 29:12.959
Oh my God!

29:13.042 --> 29:13.876
Oh!

29:14.375 --> 29:15.292
Oh!

29:15.375 --> 29:17.500
Well, congrats.
Walt hates his birthday.
