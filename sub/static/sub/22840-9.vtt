WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:03.977
So 
Peruggia thinks to himself,

00:04.054 --> 00:05.742
<i>this is our painting,</i>

00:05.819 --> 00:08.900
<i>and I'm bringing it 
back to my people!</i>

00:08.977 --> 00:11.449
I'm beyond drunk, 
by the way.

00:11.526 --> 00:14.362
So, the Santa bandits,
they're like,

00:14.439 --> 00:15.984
<i>time to rob another bank,</i>

00:16.061 --> 00:18.110
<i>and then, just... 
everybody just starts shooting.</i>

00:18.187 --> 00:20.638
What's it mean 
when you're swallowing too much?

00:20.715 --> 00:22.331
So Adolf Eichmann is escaped,

00:22.408 --> 00:24.697
<i>and the Mossad
literally kidnap him.</i>

00:24.774 --> 00:26.260
No! 
My water went

00:26.337 --> 00:27.742
under the couch.

00:35.350 --> 00:38.750

00:43.027 --> 00:44.112
I remember this being

00:44.189 --> 00:46.068
- the funniest thing.
- I think I'll have enough room.

00:46.145 --> 00:48.472
- Ready? One, two, three.
- Yeah.

00:49.621 --> 00:50.779
Yeah!

00:50.856 --> 00:51.904
Why was that so funny?

00:51.981 --> 00:53.612
Oh, no.
Can you see my belly?

00:54.493 --> 00:55.982
That's your first
"Drunk History" line.

00:56.059 --> 00:57.281
Oh, remember?

00:57.358 --> 00:58.801
- Callback.
- I love you.

00:58.878 --> 01:00.644
I love you. Muah!

01:06.215 --> 01:08.276
Hi, 
my name's Mark Gagliardi,

01:08.353 --> 01:09.845
and today, 
we're gonna talk about

01:09.922 --> 01:11.834
the theft of the "Mona Lisa."

01:11.911 --> 01:13.148
It's a painting.

01:13.225 --> 01:15.498
- Hm.
- It's 1911.

01:15.590 --> 01:18.817
<i>Paris is 
the center of the universe,</i>

01:18.894 --> 01:20.457
<i>but at this moment in time,</i>

01:20.534 --> 01:21.875
<i>the "Mona Lisa" was not</i>

01:21.952 --> 01:24.196
<i>actually a terribly famous painting.</i>

01:24.273 --> 01:26.167
<i>It's just one of the paintings
that's hanging in the Louvre,</i>

01:26.244 --> 01:28.427
<i>and the French are like,
yeah, it's a painting</i>

01:28.504 --> 01:30.042
<i>in the Louvre.
Like, it kind of looks</i>

01:30.119 --> 01:31.645
<i>like my aunt, but,
you know,</i>

01:31.722 --> 01:33.865
<i>I don't think 
it's all that important.</i>

01:34.215 --> 01:36.170
And, uh, at this point,

01:36.254 --> 01:39.529
<i>Vincenzo Peruggia, 
an Italian immigrant,</i>

01:39.597 --> 01:43.588
got a job as a glassmaker
in the Louvre.

01:43.681 --> 01:45.241
<i>And he's like,
oh, look at this!</i>

01:45.318 --> 01:47.188
<i>All of these beautiful paintings
in the Louvre!</i>

01:47.265 --> 01:49.141
<i>But the French are like,
oh, you're,</i>

01:49.218 --> 01:51.471
<i>you know,
a dirtbag from Italy</i>

01:51.539 --> 01:53.833
<i>who's come in 
to steal our jobs,</i>

01:53.919 --> 01:56.151
<i>so clean the floors, Macaroni.</i>

01:56.228 --> 01:59.535
And that's the world that
Peruggia was brought into.

01:59.612 --> 02:00.964
<i>And he would think to himself,</i>

02:01.041 --> 02:03.447
<i>why are these French
calling me "Macaroni"</i>

02:03.540 --> 02:07.742
<i>when this great piece
of Renaissance art came</i>

02:07.820 --> 02:09.071
<i>from my homeland</i>

02:09.148 --> 02:12.919
<i>and was stolen by Napoleon?</i>

02:13.308 --> 02:16.497
<i>You know what? 
These assholes.</i>

02:16.665 --> 02:18.695
<i>Leonardo da Vinci</i>

02:18.772 --> 02:20.617
<i>worked out of Florence.</i>

02:20.694 --> 02:22.395
<i>He painted this pla...</i>

02:22.472 --> 02:24.534
<i>he painted this painting</i>

02:24.611 --> 02:29.203
<i>of Lisa del Giocondo in Florence.</i>

02:29.280 --> 02:31.246
<i>This is our painting.</i>

02:31.323 --> 02:34.710
<i>And I'm bringing it 
back to my people!</i>

02:34.778 --> 02:35.781
I'm v...

02:35.849 --> 02:40.288
I'm beyond drunk,
by the way. F-Y-Information.

02:40.468 --> 02:43.359
<i>So on August 20, 1911,</i>

02:43.468 --> 02:45.814
<i>Vincenzo Peruggia 
went to the Louvre</i>

02:45.891 --> 02:48.324
<i>and he hid 
in a closet until Monday,</i>

02:48.401 --> 02:51.719
<i>the day that the Louvre
is closed for cleaning.</i>

02:51.796 --> 02:54.513
<i>So he comes out, 
and he walks up</i>

02:54.590 --> 02:56.204
<i>to the "Mona Lisa."</i>

02:56.281 --> 02:58.287
<i>He puts it 
under his smock...</i>

02:58.941 --> 03:01.662
<i>and... 
well, he steals it.</i>

03:01.841 --> 03:03.869
<i>And he leaves the Louvre...</i>

03:05.180 --> 03:07.586
<i>Walks home 
to his one-room apartment</i>

03:07.663 --> 03:11.959
<i>and places the "Mona Lisa"
on his breakfast table.</i>

03:12.079 --> 03:16.294
<i>So Tuesday, August 22nd,
the Louvre realizes</i>

03:16.371 --> 03:19.685
<i>Mona Lisa la Giocondo 
has been stolen</i>

03:19.762 --> 03:21.128
<i>from the Louvre.</i>

03:21.205 --> 03:24.294
<i>And every newspaper 
in the world printed</i>

03:24.371 --> 03:26.128
<i>any picture 
they could that was like,</i>

03:26.205 --> 03:28.388
<i>"Here's What The Mona Lisa Looks Like!"</i>

03:28.465 --> 03:31.372
<i>Little kids are selling newspapers</i>

03:31.449 --> 03:33.132
for a penny a pape, going,

03:33.209 --> 03:35.738
<i>oh, this is some "Ocean's Eleven" shit</i>

03:35.815 --> 03:36.778
<i>right here.</i>

03:36.855 --> 03:39.175
<i>So this picture of "Mona Lisa"</i>

03:39.252 --> 03:42.823
<i>is being spread
throughout every continent</i>

03:42.900 --> 03:44.891
<i>in the world,
and everybody was going,</i>

03:44.968 --> 03:48.971
<i>oh, my God, what a
beautiful work of art...</i>

03:49.054 --> 03:50.826
<i>this woman is.</i>

03:52.911 --> 03:54.171
<i>Rude.</i>

03:54.855 --> 03:57.060
I feel like the magic has been taken out

03:57.137 --> 04:00.092
of my soul and put onto display.

04:00.691 --> 04:03.567
Well, that's what happens
when you do television.

04:03.706 --> 04:07.971
So Louis Lépine, the
head of the French police,

04:08.048 --> 04:12.034
<i>brings in Peruggia for an interrogation.</i>

04:12.111 --> 04:14.173
<i>And Lépine's like, what'd you do?</i>

04:14.250 --> 04:15.750
<i>What'd you do at the Louvre?</i>

04:15.827 --> 04:18.607
<i>And Peruggia's like, uh, why am I here?</i>

04:18.684 --> 04:20.719
<i>What's all this all
about? And Lépine's like,</i>

04:20.796 --> 04:24.552
<i>Uh, the "Mona Lisa"! It's been stolen!</i>

04:24.629 --> 04:26.141
<i>Why aren't you listening?</i>

04:26.218 --> 04:27.690
<i>And Peruggia's like...</i>

04:27.767 --> 04:30.541
<i>The "Mona Lisa" was
stolen? And Lépine's like,</i>

04:30.618 --> 04:34.187
<i>this guy's an idiot, man.
There's no way he did it.</i>

04:34.303 --> 04:38.144
<i>So, for the next two
years, every morning,</i>

04:38.221 --> 04:41.703
<i>the gentle Peruggia would
look at this masterpiece,</i>

04:41.780 --> 04:43.285
<i>and he would say...</i>

04:45.444 --> 04:47.493
<i>I've looked
at a lot of paintings,</i>

04:47.570 --> 04:50.280
<i>but until I looked at the "Mona Lisa"...</i>

04:51.176 --> 04:54.382
<i>no painting ever looked at me.</i>

04:54.459 --> 04:57.097
<i>And that... that smile</i>

04:57.174 --> 05:00.186
<i>on Mona Lisa's face is saying,</i>

05:00.359 --> 05:01.884
<i>"I acknowledge you.</i>

05:01.961 --> 05:03.584
<i>I know what you're going through..."</i>

05:03.661 --> 05:05.780
<i>"And it's okay."</i>

05:08.093 --> 05:10.011
- Everything's okay.
- Yeah,

05:10.088 --> 05:12.381
I need another one of these.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.630
<i>So, after two years,</i>

05:14.707 --> 05:17.841
<i>Peruggia reaches out to Alfredo Geri,</i>

05:17.918 --> 05:20.519
<i>who is an Italian art
dealer, and he goes...</i>

05:20.596 --> 05:21.728
<i>I have-a something</i>

05:21.805 --> 05:23.558
<i>you might be interested in.</i>

05:23.635 --> 05:25.118
<i>It's-a the "Mona Lisa."</i>

05:25.195 --> 05:26.997
<i>I'm-a gonna give you the picture,</i>

05:27.074 --> 05:28.894
<i>and I'm-a gonna get-a some money.</i>

05:28.971 --> 05:31.771
<i>So, Alfredo Geri, why don't you call me</i>

05:31.848 --> 05:32.995
<i>on the telephone...</i>

05:33.072 --> 05:34.766
Is it true if he found a mushroom,

05:34.843 --> 05:36.630
he would become a little bigger?

05:37.809 --> 05:39.920
You don't like my accent?
Is that it?

05:40.106 --> 05:41.190
Okay.

05:41.267 --> 05:43.706
So, Alfredo Geri reaches out

05:43.783 --> 05:45.874
<i>to the Italian authorities,
and he's like...</i>

05:45.951 --> 05:47.425
<i>Aye, you a-lookin'</i>

05:47.502 --> 05:50.027
<i>for-a the guy
that stole the "Mona Lisa"?</i>

05:50.104 --> 05:52.013
<i>So, uh, here's the number.</i>

05:52.090 --> 05:54.212
<i>So the Italian authorities are like,</i>

05:54.289 --> 05:57.647
<i>oh, hey, you're Peruggia?
You're under arrest.</i>

05:57.733 --> 06:00.936
<i>And he's taken before the Italian court.</i>

06:01.731 --> 06:03.435
<i>And he says, this painting...</i>

06:03.512 --> 06:06.186
<i>la Giocondo, the "Mona Lisa"...</i>

06:06.263 --> 06:10.948
<i>was stolen from Italy by Napoleon,</i>

06:11.025 --> 06:14.660
<i>and it was my task to take this painting</i>

06:14.737 --> 06:17.760
<i>out of the Louvre and bring it back</i>

06:17.837 --> 06:21.013
<i>to the Italian people who deserve it.</i>

06:21.121 --> 06:24.560
<i>I have nothing to be ashamed of,</i>

06:24.637 --> 06:26.147
<i>as an Italian!</i>

06:26.265 --> 06:28.956
And after his impassioned speech,

06:29.033 --> 06:32.141
<i>the Italian judge said, actually,</i>

06:32.218 --> 06:35.569
<i>this painting wasn't stolen by Napoleon.</i>

06:35.687 --> 06:38.331
<i>Leonardo da Vinci came to France</i>

06:38.408 --> 06:40.164
<i>and actually gave this painting</i>

06:40.241 --> 06:42.391
<i>to the king of France as a gift,</i>

06:42.468 --> 06:45.776
<i>so you really don't
have a leg to stand on.</i>

06:48.061 --> 06:49.517
<i>But, you know what?</i>

06:49.594 --> 06:52.268
<i>We're super into your patriotism.</i>

06:52.345 --> 06:55.171
<i>You're super good at being Italian,</i>

06:55.248 --> 06:57.140
<i>so how about this?</i>

06:57.217 --> 06:59.969
<i>We give you a sentence of seven months,</i>

07:00.046 --> 07:02.718
<i>which is what you've
already been in prison,</i>

07:02.795 --> 07:05.316
<i>and we release you today.</i>

07:05.393 --> 07:06.979
<i>And Peruggia was like,</i>

07:07.056 --> 07:09.620
<i>I really like you guys. Thanks, man.</i>

07:10.923 --> 07:14.105
Vincenzo Peruggia was...

07:15.492 --> 07:20.384
An inconsequential
housepainter from Italy,

07:20.461 --> 07:22.657
<i>and by stealing the "Mona Lisa,"</i>

07:22.734 --> 07:24.499
<i>he made that work of art</i>

07:24.576 --> 07:28.066
<i>the most famous painting
in all the world.</i>

07:28.644 --> 07:30.800
Ah, *** hell, dude.

07:30.877 --> 07:32.668

Hello, I'm...

08:20.621 --> 08:24.270
my name's Brendon Walsh,
and today we're going to

08:24.347 --> 08:27.832
be talking about the Santa bandits.

08:28.503 --> 08:31.772
<i>Our story starts in 1927,</i>

08:31.849 --> 08:34.524
<i>in the days leading up to Christmas.</i>

08:34.601 --> 08:36.940
<i>Marshall Ratliff got out of jail</i>

08:37.019 --> 08:38.701
<i>and he's like, I'm out of jail.</i>

08:38.778 --> 08:40.421
<i>Time to rob another bank,</i>

08:40.498 --> 08:42.606
<i>but I need help,
so I'm gonna get...</i>

08:42.683 --> 08:44.833
<i>uh, uh... this guy Ed Helms.</i>

08:44.910 --> 08:46.848
<i>Oh... oh, from "The Hangover."</i>

08:46.957 --> 08:49.395
This guy... Henry Helms?

08:49.472 --> 08:52.021
<i>I'm gonna get Henry
Helms and Robert Hill,</i>

08:52.098 --> 08:54.594
<i>and they rope in Helms' brother-in-law,</i>

08:54.671 --> 08:57.598
<i>Louis Davis. And Ratliff says,</i>

08:57.675 --> 09:00.137
<i>help us rob this bank in Cisco.</i>

09:00.326 --> 09:02.790
And, uh, Ratliff's afraid

09:02.867 --> 09:04.792
he's gonna get recognized.

09:04.869 --> 09:07.140
<i>And he goes, I wanna disguise myself.</i>

09:07.217 --> 09:09.916
<i>Hey, it's Christmas.</i>

09:10.054 --> 09:11.652
<i>So they steal this Buick,</i>

09:11.729 --> 09:13.454
<i>and they arrive in Cisco</i>

09:13.531 --> 09:16.216
<i>on the morning of December 23rd.</i>

09:16.293 --> 09:18.452
<i>Uh, Ratliff gets out of the car.</i>

09:18.529 --> 09:19.927
<i>He's dressed as Santa,</i>

09:20.004 --> 09:21.922
<i>and he gets mobbed by kids.</i>

09:21.999 --> 09:23.174
<i>And you see Santa,</i>

09:23.251 --> 09:24.453
kids are gonna come towards you.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.026
Kids wanna see you!

09:26.103 --> 09:27.226
You're like Justin...

09:27.303 --> 09:30.004
you're like the Justin Beaver

09:30.081 --> 09:32.599
of... the times.

09:32.676 --> 09:34.697
- Yeah.
- And he's a bank robber,

09:34.774 --> 09:37.111
<i>but he's like,
yeah, okay, I gotta go.</i>

09:37.188 --> 09:39.809
<i>Santa's gotta make a deposit, kids.</i>

09:39.950 --> 09:43.708
<i>So after that, he goes into the bank.</i>

09:43.986 --> 09:45.928
<i>And he doesn't even say anything.</i>

09:46.011 --> 09:48.541
<i>And, uh, the tellers are like,</i>

09:48.618 --> 09:49.954
<i>Santa's here!</i>

09:50.031 --> 09:52.703
<i>And then Hill, Helms, Davis</i>

09:52.780 --> 09:55.341
<i>all bust in with their guns a-blazing.</i>

09:55.418 --> 09:57.176
<i>They go, hey, uh, all right,</i>

09:57.253 --> 10:00.656
<i>everybody shut up!
We're robbing this place.</i>

10:00.733 --> 10:06.415
Santa Ratliff gets $12,400 in cash

10:06.492 --> 10:10.851
<i>and $150,000 in bonds.</i>

10:10.962 --> 10:14.382
<i>And Santa's like, yeah! But this lady,</i>

10:14.459 --> 10:16.610
<i>Mrs. Blasingame,</i>

10:16.687 --> 10:19.515
<i>goes into the bank and
loses her shit.</i>

10:19.592 --> 10:22.357
<i>She's like...</i>

10:22.526 --> 10:25.860
<i>So she, uh, runs out
screaming her head off...</i>

10:25.937 --> 10:30.416
<i>Here's the thing...</i>

10:30.493 --> 10:32.667
I love that Duncan
Trussell is this woman.

10:32.744 --> 10:35.963
Hey!
Terence McKenna predicted

10:36.040 --> 10:39.409
this bank was gonna be robbed, man!

10:40.173 --> 10:42.377
<i>So then the whole town,</i>

10:42.454 --> 10:44.609
<i>they hear her running up and down the...</i>

10:44.686 --> 10:47.541
<i>And then, at this time,</i>

10:47.618 --> 10:50.234
<i>the Texas Bank Association was like,</i>

10:50.311 --> 10:53.174
<i>well, we're offering $5,000</i>

10:53.251 --> 10:55.523
<i>for anybody who shoots a bank robber</i>

10:55.600 --> 10:57.598
<i>during a bank robbery.</i>

10:57.675 --> 11:01.748
<i>And the whole town is
like, we could use $5,000!</i>

11:01.832 --> 11:03.841
<i>That's a lot of money back now.</i>

11:03.918 --> 11:06.166
<i>So everybody, grab their guns!</i>

11:06.243 --> 11:08.315
<i>'Cause an angry mom's
about to...</i>

11:08.509 --> 11:11.268
"Angry mom's about to form."

11:12.216 --> 11:14.669
<i>So, um, they go to the bank</i>

11:14.746 --> 11:17.560
while all the... the robbery's going on.

11:17.652 --> 11:20.014
And then it just... everybody
just starts shooting.

11:20.798 --> 11:22.418
<i>Customers are getting shot.</i>

11:22.495 --> 11:24.140
<i>A guy gets shot in the leg.</i>

11:24.217 --> 11:25.926
<i>So the Santa bandits,</i>

11:26.003 --> 11:28.255
<i>they're like, why is
everybody shooting us?</i>

11:28.332 --> 11:29.788
<i>Get into the alley! 'Cause that's</i>

11:29.865 --> 11:31.076
<i>where the Buick is.</i>

11:31.153 --> 11:32.975
<i>But everybody keeps shooting.</i>

11:33.052 --> 11:34.183
<i>A bandit gets shot,</i>

11:34.260 --> 11:35.479
<i>a... uh, uh...</i>

11:35.556 --> 11:37.738
<i>the bank president gets shot!</i>

11:37.815 --> 11:39.266
Everybody's going nuts. All right.

11:39.343 --> 11:41.487
<i>So, the-the the Santa bandits,</i>

11:41.564 --> 11:43.094
<i>they grab these two young girls</i>

11:43.171 --> 11:47.038
<i>as human shields to get into their Buick</i>

11:47.115 --> 11:48.763
<i>and get the *** out of there.</i>

11:48.840 --> 11:51.450
<i>So Santa's driving the car,</i>

11:51.527 --> 11:53.781
<i>and he looks at the
gas gauge, and he goes,</i>

11:53.858 --> 11:56.283
<i>What the*** we're
almost out of gas!</i>

11:56.360 --> 11:57.714
<i>What a bunch of idiots.</i>

11:57.791 --> 11:59.905
<i>And they're like, we drove 100 miles</i>

11:59.982 --> 12:04.555
<i>from Wichita Falls and we
didn't get gas in 1927?</i>

12:04.632 --> 12:07.287
<i>So, they see this Oldsmobile,</i>

12:07.364 --> 12:09.063
<i>and they're like, give
us your Oldsmobile.</i>

12:09.140 --> 12:12.109
<i>And he leaves.
Helms gets shot.</i>

12:12.186 --> 12:13.576
<i>And they're like, come
on, put all the money</i>

12:13.653 --> 12:15.199
<i>in here and get Davis in there.</i>

12:15.276 --> 12:16.604
<i>And they get in the Oldsmobile,</i>

12:16.681 --> 12:20.203
<i>and then they realize,
uh, *** the keys!</i>

12:20.520 --> 12:23.117
<i>So they're like, well...
well, we can't ***</i>

12:23.194 --> 12:24.338
<i>do anything with this.</i>

12:24.415 --> 12:26.581
<i>So then they, like, get
back into the Buick,</i>

12:26.658 --> 12:28.409
<i>and they leave Davis there.</i>

12:28.747 --> 12:31.111
<i>Poor sap. He's ***.</i>

12:31.188 --> 12:32.908
<i>And they're like, well, that sucks.</i>

12:32.985 --> 12:34.578
<i>And then they're like, oh, shit!</i>

12:34.655 --> 12:37.182
<i>We left the money in that car too...</i>

12:37.259 --> 12:39.292
<i>in the Oldsmobile. And they're like...</i>

12:39.369 --> 12:40.587
Uh...

12:40.712 --> 12:43.448
what's it mean when
you're swallowing too much?

12:43.525 --> 12:45.125
Good question.

12:45.202 --> 12:48.768
<i>So they're trying to
cross the Brazos River,</i>

12:48.845 --> 12:50.555
<i>but they get ambushed,</i>

12:50.632 --> 12:54.167
<i>and they shoot Ratcliff
six times.</i>

12:54.251 --> 12:58.107
<i>So Helms and Hill just
give themselves up,</i>

12:58.184 --> 13:02.443
<i>and Ratliff... survives.</i>

13:02.520 --> 13:05.604
<i>So the townsfolk are out
there,</i>

13:05.681 --> 13:08.090
<i>and they're like, we've
had it with this guy!</i>

13:08.167 --> 13:10.158
<i>And they put a noose
around his neck.</i>

13:10.235 --> 13:13.287
<i>They're like, we're
gonna publicly lynch you,</i>

13:13.364 --> 13:15.363
<i>'cause we've had it with your shit.</i>

13:15.440 --> 13:18.104
<i>And he's just like, hey, I got an idea.</i>

13:18.298 --> 13:20.294
<i>Eh... forgive me!</i>

13:20.371 --> 13:22.312
<i>And then they're like,
uh, no, no, no, no.</i>

13:22.389 --> 13:25.268
<i>And then they hang him.</i>

13:25.861 --> 13:28.354
<i>Then... well, yeah,
then he's croaked.</i>

13:29.547 --> 13:31.878
<i>These guys *** up.</i>

13:33.651 --> 13:35.550
<i>Because back then,</i>

13:35.627 --> 13:38.729
it was, uh, so easy

13:38.889 --> 13:40.628
to get away with crimes.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.182
<i>They were stupid.</i>

13:44.571 --> 13:46.284
Is this a wig, or...

13:46.376 --> 13:48.917
There's a wig and a beard.

13:54.138 --> 13:55.643
That's good.

13:56.946 --> 13:59.664
Stay tuned
for more "Drunk History."

13:59.741 --> 14:01.854
Ho-ho-ho!

14:03.876 --> 14:07.050
- My God, it's so cold.
- I love you.

14:08.371 --> 14:09.679
Oh, you got it.

14:09.756 --> 14:11.690
How's my hair look?

14:12.010 --> 14:13.538
You look great.

14:14.650 --> 14:16.806
What, like, Jewish
desserts have you had...

14:16.883 --> 14:18.523
in your life?

14:18.891 --> 14:20.863
Is latkes, uh, Jewish?

14:20.940 --> 14:22.763
It's not dessert,
but it is Jewish.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.647
- Mm-hmm.
- My husband's always,

14:24.724 --> 14:26.839
like, hiding treats from me.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.917
Is this *** a piece of pie?

14:30.016 --> 14:31.706
That's what it looks like.

14:33.153 --> 14:34.544
Oh, my God, this is so good.

14:34.621 --> 14:36.179
It's good? This is my first attempt.

14:36.256 --> 14:37.688
What's this called again?
One more time.

14:37.765 --> 14:39.745
- Pie?
- Oh, cool.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.706
I'm not Jewish.

14:43.813 --> 14:46.456
Hello. I'm Rachel Bloom,

14:46.533 --> 14:48.987
and today we're gonna
talk about the capture...

14:49.680 --> 14:51.300
of Adolf Eichmann.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.635
<i>So Israel's established in 1948,</i>

14:55.712 --> 15:00.111
<i>and Israel's like, okay,
we need our own CIA.</i>

15:00.188 --> 15:04.046
<i>And so they form the Mossad,
and David Ben-Gurion,</i>

15:04.123 --> 15:05.328
<i>who's the prime minister, is like,</i>

15:05.405 --> 15:07.518
<i>I'm going to appoint you,</i>

15:07.595 --> 15:10.513
<i>Isser Harel, to be head of Mossad.</i>

15:10.590 --> 15:12.456
<i>And Isser Harel is like, awesome.</i>

15:12.533 --> 15:15.485
<i>We're gonna hunt down
Nazi war criminals,</i>

15:15.562 --> 15:17.060
<i>'cause there are a lot of Nazis</i>

15:17.137 --> 15:18.484
<i>still, like, chilling.</i>

15:18.561 --> 15:20.185
<i>And the guy at the top of their list</i>

15:20.262 --> 15:21.882
<i>is Adolf Eichmann,</i>

15:21.959 --> 15:25.010
<i>who literally planned the Holocaust.</i>

15:25.087 --> 15:26.396
<i>So Isser Harel is like,</i>

15:26.473 --> 15:28.798
<i>let's nail this *** mother ***</i>

15:28.875 --> 15:30.316
<i>to the wall ***  like a moose</i>

15:30.393 --> 15:31.927
<i>who's been hunted.</i>

15:32.028 --> 15:35.311
<i>Meanwhile, Adolf Eichmann
is living in Argentina,</i>

15:35.388 --> 15:37.650
<i>making, like, a new
alias. And he's like...</i>

15:37.727 --> 15:40.017
<i>Hmm,
what's an Argentinean-sounding name?</i>

15:40.094 --> 15:42.520
<i>Oh, I know, Ricardo Clement.</i>

15:42.597 --> 15:45.187
<i>Good job, Adolf...
I mean, Ricardo.</i>

15:45.264 --> 15:47.355
<i>Wink. However, his kids,</i>

15:47.432 --> 15:48.749
<i>who were there with him, they're like,</i>

15:48.826 --> 15:50.988
<i>well, I'm really attached to
Eichmann.</i>

15:51.065 --> 15:52.468
<i>It's, like, in all my yearbooks.</i>

15:52.545 --> 15:54.898
<i>Like, I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna... I'm gonna keep it.</i>

15:54.975 --> 15:57.430
<i>So, the Eichmann kids ***
are stupid.</i>

15:59.973 --> 16:01.996
Okay, so...

16:02.073 --> 16:05.801
<i>in the 1950s, Eichmann's
son, Klaus, starts dating</i>

16:05.878 --> 16:07.621
<i>this very nice girl, Sylvia.</i>

16:07.698 --> 16:09.541
<i>And when she's like,
Daddy, I'm dating, like,</i>

16:09.618 --> 16:12.429
<i>the best guy. His name
is Klaus Eichmann.</i>

16:12.506 --> 16:14.912
<i>And he's like, that's weird.</i>

16:15.451 --> 16:17.458
<i>My dog loves licking her*** .</i>

16:18.034 --> 16:19.855
My dog licks her vagina

16:19.932 --> 16:21.692
<i>- more than any dog.
- That's cool.</i>

16:21.769 --> 16:24.027
<i>Anyway, so Sylvia's father,
Lothar Hermann,</i>

16:24.104 --> 16:26.525
<i>is like, huh, Eichmann, Eichmann...</i>

16:26.602 --> 16:28.653
<i>Where
have I heard that name?</i>

16:30.906 --> 16:33.879
<i>And so, Lothar tips off the Mossad.</i>

16:33.956 --> 16:36.010
<i>And he's like, my daughter's dating</i>

16:36.087 --> 16:37.934
<i>a guy named Klaus
Eichmann. Like, this might</i>

16:38.011 --> 16:39.334
<i>be Adolf Eichmann... and this might be</i>

16:39.411 --> 16:40.726
<i>the son of Adolf Eichmann.</i>

16:40.803 --> 16:42.052
<i>And the Mossad is like,</i>

16:42.129 --> 16:43.781
<i>we need to check this guy out.</i>

16:43.858 --> 16:46.542
<i>And so, they send
operatives to Argentina,</i>

16:46.619 --> 16:48.095
<i>all of whom are Holocaust survivors.</i>

16:48.172 --> 16:50.173
<i>And they're like, you need
to take pictures of Eichmann</i>

16:50.250 --> 16:52.221
<i>to make sure this is Eichmann,
so that we're not just, like,</i>

16:52.298 --> 16:53.922
<i>capturing some poor Argentinean dude.</i>

16:53.999 --> 16:54.886
<i>Smart.</i>

16:54.963 --> 16:56.950
Okay, so...

16:57.291 --> 16:58.379
No!

16:58.456 --> 16:59.388
What are you looking for?

16:59.465 --> 17:00.989
My water went under the couch.

17:01.066 --> 17:02.253
I got you.

17:02.961 --> 17:04.259
- You got it?
- Thanks, friend.

17:04.336 --> 17:05.586
Mm-hmm.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.262
So, they send a guy,

17:08.346 --> 17:10.074
<i>who just kind of walks up to him</i>

17:10.151 --> 17:11.980
<i>while he's gardening, and they're like,</i>

17:12.057 --> 17:13.689
<i>tell us how you garden. And he's like,</i>

17:13.766 --> 17:15.082
<i>well... and he, like, starts</i>

17:15.159 --> 17:16.171
<i>to explain gardening to them.</i>

17:16.248 --> 17:17.762
<i>And the whole time, they have</i>

17:17.839 --> 17:19.767
<i>a suitcase that has,
like, a spy camera in it,</i>

17:19.844 --> 17:21.215
<i>so they're like...</i>

17:21.368 --> 17:22.611
<i>And he's like, what's that sound?</i>

17:22.688 --> 17:23.838
<i>They're like, nothing.</i>

17:23.915 --> 17:25.425
<i>So they send the pictures</i>

17:25.502 --> 17:27.314
<i>back to Israel, and the Mossad is like,</i>

17:27.391 --> 17:30.615
<i>dudes, this is Eichmann.
Let's get him there.</i>

17:31.010 --> 17:32.681
<i>But Harel's like, whoa.</i>

17:32.758 --> 17:35.480
<i>- Argentina is really bad...
- Mm-hmm.</i>

17:35.557 --> 17:37.251
<i>About extraditing Nazis.</i>

17:37.328 --> 17:39.916
<i>They, like, don't give
a shit for some reason.</i>

17:39.993 --> 17:43.012
<i>I don't know why.
I don't know why!</i>

17:43.089 --> 17:44.926
<i>But they're just bad about it.</i>

17:45.050 --> 17:46.661
<i>And he tells Zvi Aharoni,</i>

17:46.738 --> 17:48.808
<i>if we're gonna
capture Adolf Eichmann,</i>

17:48.885 --> 17:50.603
<i>we're gonna have to...
we're gonna have to,</i>

17:50.680 --> 17:52.072
<i>like, full-on kidnap him.</i>

17:52.149 --> 17:54.035
<i>Like-like a kid
on a milk carton.</i>

17:54.112 --> 17:55.877
<i>We're gonna have to
milk-carton Adolf Eichmann.</i>

17:55.954 --> 17:57.574
<i>- Mm.
- So...</i>

17:57.651 --> 18:01.206
the four operatives, um...

18:02.987 --> 18:05.654
they go to Argentina...
it's weird to tell a story

18:05.731 --> 18:07.322
about Nazis and be so cozy.

18:07.399 --> 18:08.349
Anyway,

18:08.426 --> 18:10.385
<i>they park a deserted car</i>

18:10.462 --> 18:11.686
<i>to lure Eichmann.</i>

18:11.763 --> 18:13.361
<i>And they're like, okay guys,</i>

18:13.438 --> 18:16.273
<i>so... to distract ourselves</i>

18:16.350 --> 18:18.013
<i>we need to come up with a group name.</i>

18:18.090 --> 18:21.742
<i>How about...
"The Kidnapping Friends"?</i>

18:21.819 --> 18:24.476
<i>And one of them's like,
no, I don't... I...</i>

18:24.553 --> 18:26.352
<i>okay, if we're gonna
come up with names,</i>

18:26.429 --> 18:28.904
<i>now's not the time to do
it... but if we're going to,</i>

18:28.981 --> 18:32.218
<i>I think it should be called
"The Abduction Posse."</i>

18:32.295 --> 18:35.036
<i>And another one's like,
no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

18:35.113 --> 18:37.013
<i>Listen, how about, I don't know,</i>

18:37.090 --> 18:38.179
<i>"The Snatch Squad?"</i>

18:38.256 --> 18:40.048
<i>And they're like, Snatch Squad!</i>

18:40.125 --> 18:42.843
<i>And just then, that's when
Eichmann walks down the road.</i>

18:42.920 --> 18:45.709
<i>And they're like, uh,
our car is broken down.</i>

18:47.632 --> 18:48.865
<i>Psych! It's not!</i>

18:48.942 --> 18:50.528
<i>And they tackle Eichmann.</i>

18:50.605 --> 18:51.730
<i>They just, like, full-on,</i>

18:51.807 --> 18:53.068
<i>like, bum-rush Eichmann.</i>

18:53.145 --> 18:54.716
<i>And they get him in the car,</i>

18:54.802 --> 18:57.171
and my dog continues
to lick her own ♪♪♪.

18:57.248 --> 18:58.502
I'll be dogged.

18:59.965 --> 19:01.856
Anyway... I wanna do

19:01.933 --> 19:03.448
the rest of the story lying down.

19:03.525 --> 19:05.208
You do it. You do what you...

19:05.285 --> 19:07.807
- you do it the way you want.
- So, they bring him

19:07.884 --> 19:10.434
<i>to a safe house,
and then they try</i>

19:10.511 --> 19:12.934
<i>to question him to make
sure it's Adolf Eichmann</i>

19:13.011 --> 19:14.583
<i>living in Germany...
Ar-Argentina.</i>

19:14.660 --> 19:17.568
<i>And Eichmann's like, hola.</i>

19:17.997 --> 19:20.458
<i>Me llamo Ricardo Clement.</i>

19:20.535 --> 19:22.998
<i>Like, he's
pretending to be Argentinean.</i>

19:23.075 --> 19:24.785
<i>They're just like, clearly not.</i>

19:24.862 --> 19:27.522
<i>You are a pasty white German dude.</i>

19:27.786 --> 19:30.643
<i>And finally, he drops all the shit,</i>

19:30.720 --> 19:33.164
<i>and he's like, all right,
I'm Adolf Eichmann.</i>

19:33.241 --> 19:35.451
<i>Can I get a glass of wine?</i>

19:35.704 --> 19:38.539
<i>And they're like, okay,
there is a plane leaving</i>

19:38.616 --> 19:40.581
<i>from Buenos Aires to Israel.</i>

19:40.658 --> 19:42.961
<i>How do we sneak Eichmann
onto this plane?</i>

19:43.038 --> 19:46.971
<i>So May 20, 1960, they
sedate Adolf Eichmann,</i>

19:47.048 --> 19:49.225
<i>they dress him up as an
El Al flight attendant...</i>

19:49.302 --> 19:50.701
<i>which is the Israeli airline...</i>

19:50.778 --> 19:53.094
<i>and they literally, like,
drag him to the airport.</i>

19:53.171 --> 19:55.627
<i>Like, full-on
"Weekend At Bernie's" -ing</i>

19:55.704 --> 19:57.659
<i>the orchestrator of,
like, the worst thing</i>

19:57.736 --> 19:59.344
<i>that's ever happened in their lives,</i>

19:59.421 --> 20:01.235
<i>and just being like, hey,
I'm tired.</i>

20:01.312 --> 20:03.487
<i>Hello, I'm an El Al flight attendant.</i>

20:03.564 --> 20:04.914
<i>And they're literally carrying him</i>

20:04.991 --> 20:06.581
<i>like, onto the plane.</i>

20:06.751 --> 20:09.451
I mean, like, the
story's insane.

20:09.595 --> 20:11.164
<i>So they get him to Israel,</i>

20:11.241 --> 20:13.616
<i>and they put Eichmann on trial.</i>

20:13.693 --> 20:17.550
<i>And he's convicted, and... he's hung</i>

20:17.642 --> 20:19.479
<i>- outside of Tel Aviv.
- Wow.</i>

20:19.556 --> 20:20.891
<i>And the guys who captured him</i>

20:20.975 --> 20:22.877
<i>are like, look, f...</i>

20:23.055 --> 20:26.032
<i>far be it for we to celebrate death,</i>

20:26.109 --> 20:28.307
<i>but also, um, *** yeah.</i>

20:28.384 --> 20:30.969
<i>- *** The Nazis.
- *** The Nazis, man.</i>

20:31.046 --> 20:33.698
I'm alive.
I'm 97.4 Ashkenazi.
