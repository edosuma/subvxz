Drink! Drink! Drink!

00:46.800 --> 00:47.500

Drink!

Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink!

00:50.100 --> 00:52.600
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink...!

01:50.700 --> 01:52.400
Sorry, no ID.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.200
It's okay. Brass has a line
on the resident director.

01:57.900 --> 01:58.500
Lanie!

01:58.500 --> 02:00.300
Oh, my God, no!

02:00.800 --> 02:03.400
My God, Lanie, I can't believe it.
You really did it.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.800
Hey! Let her on through.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.500
Monica!

02:09.600 --> 02:10.699
Lanie!

02:11.800 --> 02:14.200
Don't you ever die on me! Promise!

02:14.200 --> 02:16.100
I won't.
I promise.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.300
okay, come on.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.100
It's the third jumper
on campus this year.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.700
Maybe it's contagious.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.300
I saw this documentary once
on suicides

02:30.300 --> 02:32.000
off the Golden Gate Bridge,

02:33.500 --> 02:35.600
and they interviewed
a survivor

02:35.600 --> 02:38.300
and he said the moment
that he let go of the railing,

02:38.800 --> 02:41.200
he realized that all of
his problems were fixable,

02:42.000 --> 02:43.300
except for
having jumped.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.800
Hey, Catherine.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.300
Uh, yeah, Nicky,
what you got?

02:51.500 --> 02:52.500
Chains and padlocks.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.700
There's no roof access
from the dorm.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.700
Well, the body landed
close to the building,

02:56.700 --> 02:58.600
so if she didn't
come from the roof,

02:58.600 --> 03:00.300
she must have come
out of a room.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.100
Okay, I'll work my way down.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.200
Nick, you in the dorm?

03:05.200 --> 03:06.300
That's affirmative.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.900
I'm with the
resident director.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.900
He's ID'd the victim
as Kira Dellinger.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.700
She's in Room 807.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.100
She's a freshman
from McLean, Virginia.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.800
I guess I'm going to go
notify the parents.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.000
Perks of the job.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.200
Yeah.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.700
Hey, Catherine, do you see
any wounds on the body

04:20.700 --> 04:22.300
inconsistent with the fall?

04:22.600 --> 04:23.700
Hang on.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.200
I did find this.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.600
Yeah, there's a

04:27.600 --> 04:30.900
long ptem abrasionon the lower back

04:31.100 --> 04:32.600
i think i know how i got there

04:33.600 --> 04:36.400
No!

04:38.600 --> 04:39.500
Drag 'n' drop.

Oh, ooh!

05:41.200 --> 05:43.500
- Oh...
- Ooh, where's the fire?

05:43.500 --> 05:44.400
is it all right?

05:44.400 --> 05:45.400
Oh, sorry.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.600
Ah.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.000
"Zopidem"?

05:52.200 --> 05:52.900
That's good stuff.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.400
Yeah, it's to help me sleep.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.100
I've been having
the hardest time lately.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.100
Me, too.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.600
Well, just coming off of grave
after all these years,

06:01.100 --> 06:02.700
you know, takes
a while to adjust.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.900
You're a tough cookie.
I'm not worried about you.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.700
Take care of yourself, huh?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.200
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.100
Sweet dreams.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.100
Thanks.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.400
Oh...

06:21.600 --> 06:22.400
Hey.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.800
Sara, you done with your scene?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.300
- Yeah.
- Great, because

06:25.300 --> 06:26.500
we just caught another one.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.200
425 off Craig Road.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.500
Busy shift, but you
know I like that.

06:31.900 --> 06:33.700
- i'll see you outside, okay?
- Okay.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.400
what you got?

06:51.500 --> 06:53.400
Neighbors called in
a domestic disturbance

06:53.400 --> 06:55.600
between Adam
and Kim Jimenez.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.100
i responded, i knocked

06:58.300 --> 06:59.300
and didn't get any answers,

06:59.300 --> 07:00.600
so I looked
through the window,

07:00.600 --> 07:01.900
and this is
what I saw.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.800
Nobody's home, so
I called you guys.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.600
Blood but no body.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.100
- No sign of the couple.
- No.

07:33.100 --> 07:34.100
Nothing.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.200
Lots of blood activity here.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.400
Then someone ran out the door.

07:49.700 --> 07:50.500
Stop right there.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.700
Hands where i can see' em.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.500
This is my house.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.500
Mrs. Jimenez?

07:58.900 --> 08:00.100
Where have you been?

08:02.200 --> 08:04.400
My husband and I
had an argument.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.800
I went on a walk.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.900
Where's your husband now?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.100
I, uh...

08:14.100 --> 08:15.200
I don't know.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.800
Mrs. Jimenez,
are you okay?

08:23.200 --> 08:24.300
Bad back.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.200
Sara,

08:27.700 --> 08:29.200
she's got a very bad back.

08:29.700 --> 08:30.800
dispatch,

08:30.800 --> 08:31.700
This is CSI Lake.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.900
We need paramedics
right away on location.

08:52.000 --> 08:52.800
Hey.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.900
What do you think this might be?

08:58.100 --> 09:00.400
Well, possibly a tooth fragment.

09:00.700 --> 09:01.500
High fall?

09:01.500 --> 09:01.800
Yeah.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.300
We think she was pushed.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.500
So, between her knuckles--

09:07.600 --> 09:08.900
suggests a struggle.

09:09.100 --> 09:09.900
No!

09:13.100 --> 09:14.200
Ah!

09:15.600 --> 09:17.600
- Was she raped?
- There's no trauma,

09:17.600 --> 09:20.700
but the wet mount indicates
that she definitely had sex.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.600
Oh, no condom. Good for us.

09:24.000 --> 09:24.800
Yeah.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.900
Such a scary thing,
sending your kid off to college.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.500
Is Lindsey looking already?

09:31.700 --> 09:32.500
Yeah.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.200
In fact, we looked at WLVU
last month.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.900
Well, at least
she'd be close to home.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.000
She's free on campus,

09:41.100 --> 09:42.900
might as well be
a thousand miles away.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.500
Hey.

09:57.800 --> 09:58.700
hey.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.300
- Any luck with dorm security?
- Nope.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.100
There's no cameras,
only key cards,

10:03.100 --> 10:05.000
but according
to the residence director,

10:05.200 --> 10:07.100
the door's propped open
all the time anyway.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.700
Okay.

10:10.900 --> 10:11.600
Kind of hard to tell

10:11.600 --> 10:13.200
the difference
between a struggle

10:13.200 --> 10:15.200
and a typical
college dorm room.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.300
Yeah. You should
have seen mine.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.700
It was really bad.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.200
"X" marks the girl.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.600
Symbol for a "straight edge"
lifestyle.

10:36.700 --> 10:39.000
Abstinence from drugs,
tobacco,

10:39.100 --> 10:40.200
alcohol...

10:43.800 --> 10:45.100
...but not sex.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.300
Sexual lubricant.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.100
Give me that.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.200
So, pretty brave
for college.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.200
Yeah, or just another way
to get attention.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.900
Looks like our vic
was in a Goth band.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.500
You know, I used to be Goth.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.000
Mm-hmm.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.700
Yeah, the Goth thing
was just an act.

11:10.700 --> 11:11.800
Chicks dug it.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.800
How does that work?

11:14.100 --> 11:17.100
You act depressed to get chicks,
you get depressed chicks.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.900
just let me in.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.000
Baby, are you okay?

11:31.600 --> 11:32.600
Are you all right?

11:33.300 --> 11:35.100
You doing okay, huh?

11:35.400 --> 11:37.700
You all right?
You okay? Yeah?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.700
Did you call
these cops on me?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.300
- No...
- Did you call cops on me?

11:42.300 --> 11:45.500
I didn't call the cops!

12:08.400 --> 12:10.000
It's okay now.
Sara?

12:10.400 --> 12:11.700
Why don't you
finish up here?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.100
Wait a minute.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.400
How are we going
to handle this?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.400
Well, the guy's
under arrest.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.300
He'll be free
by tomorrow.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.600
Her husband is obviously
abusing her.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.000
There's got to be something
we can do.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.500
We'll be back
for her body next month.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.200
Or his.
Or both.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.500
There is nothing
you can do about this, Ronnie.

12:33.700 --> 12:34.700
Don't kid yourself.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.700
Sara, I've got
something really good

13:23.700 --> 13:25.300
on that defenestrated
college kid.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.500
Oh, that's
Catherine's case.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.600
Or, you know what,
talk to Nick.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.200
No, no, no, you're really
going to love this.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.600
A print on a lube tube matched
a print on her windowsill.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.000
AFIS got a hit.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.400
Ever think you'd
see that guy again?

13:44.000 --> 13:47.100
<i>Marlon West was on trial for</i>
<i>the murder of Stacy Vollmer.</i>

13:48.500 --> 13:49.500
He confessed.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.800
It was later thrown out
on a technicality.

13:51.800 --> 13:52.700
We really didn't need it.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.100
The prosecution's case against
Marlon was very strong.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.600
Until Marlon's
little sister Hannah

13:56.600 --> 13:59.200
got on the stand and confessed
to the murder herself.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.100
Marlon didn't kill Stacy.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.200
I did.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.600
And I was wearing this
when I did it.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.800
Oh, yes, I remember this case.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.800
A high school senior
at age 12.

14:11.800 --> 14:12.800
She's a prodigy.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.200
She's a pint-size
Machiavelli.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.700
She manipulated events,
fabricated evidence,

14:18.800 --> 14:19.900
and in the end...

14:20.200 --> 14:22.700
We, the jury, find the defendant,
Marlon West

14:22.800 --> 14:23.700
not guilty.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.300
Hannah, you are smart.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.400
But you have to be really smart

14:31.400 --> 14:34.700
to make people think
things happened that never did.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.800
What do you mean exactly?

14:41.900 --> 14:43.500
I didn't kill Stacy.

14:44.700 --> 14:45.900
Marlon did.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.400
She claimed that she did it

14:48.400 --> 14:49.700
because she
loved Marlon.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.600
Some warped
sense of justice...

14:51.600 --> 14:53.100
She graduated
later that summer,

14:53.100 --> 14:55.500
became legally emancipated
from her parents

14:55.500 --> 14:57.000
and went off to Harvard.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Pre-med.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.900
You keeping tabs on her?

15:00.300 --> 15:01.500
Not recently.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.800
Look, accident or no accident,
Marlon killed before.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.700
Hannah sunk this case;
Marlon got a free pass;

15:07.700 --> 15:09.100
and now he's killed again.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.400
Well, we don't
know that just yet.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.400
I mean, we don't have
Marlon's DNA

15:12.400 --> 15:14.600
to compare with the semen
that was found in the victim.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.700
All the old evidence was
expunged with the verdict.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.200
I want this case.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.700
The one that got away?

15:20.200 --> 15:22.200
We're not supposed to let them
get away, right?

15:23.900 --> 15:24.800
Okay.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.400
I'll see if I can clear it
with Ecklie.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.600
Catherine has to
supervise, though.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.800
You report to her.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Hello, Marlon.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.700
What are you guys doing here?

15:50.100 --> 15:52.000
We here to talk to you
about Kira Dellinger.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.300
Kira committed suicide.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.700
Actually, she was murdered.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.900
Somebody I know ends up dead
and I'm automatically

16:00.900 --> 16:02.000
a suspect?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.500
History has a way
of repeating itself, Marlon.

16:04.700 --> 16:05.700
You've killed before, you know?

16:05.700 --> 16:07.000
That was an accident.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.200
And I admitted I was responsible
from day one.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.400
Kira was forced out
her dorm window.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.600
Your prints were there.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.600
My prints were there

16:14.600 --> 16:16.700
because I've been in there
a million times.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.500
Kira and I were in a band.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.000
Your prints were
also found on a tube

16:20.000 --> 16:22.500
- of sexual lubricant.
- Were you having

16:22.500 --> 16:23.700
sex with her, Marlon?

16:23.700 --> 16:25.900
- Yeah, we were having sex.
- Last night?

16:26.400 --> 16:28.200
No, we had a gig last night.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.800
We... We got into a fight.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.600
Did she give you
that fat lip?

16:35.900 --> 16:37.200
No, not exactly.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.100
Kira! Kira!

16:42.600 --> 16:44.000
Keep your hands off her!

16:51.800 --> 16:52.800
I'm done!

16:52.800 --> 16:55.500
From now on, you stay
away from me, psycho!

16:57.900 --> 17:01.100
I don't know who the guy was.
I had never seen him before.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.700
After that, I just...

17:03.500 --> 17:05.900
wandered the campus
most of the night by myself.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.400
So you don't have an alibi.

17:07.599 --> 17:08.500
I guess I don't.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.300
Well, I'll tell you what.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.099
We will give you
the benefit of the doubt

17:12.599 --> 17:14.000
in exchange for this.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.500
You remember this.

17:18.099 --> 17:20.200
I assume you have
a DNA warrant, Sara.

17:20.900 --> 17:22.099
Because if you don't,

17:22.200 --> 17:24.000
you certainly
don't have his consent.

17:24.700 --> 17:25.800
Isn't that right, Marlon?

17:26.400 --> 17:27.800
Hannah, I heard
you were

17:28.200 --> 17:30.100
studying back east--
what are you doing here?

17:30.500 --> 17:31.500
Graduate school.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.700
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.800
You are not going to muddy
the waters this time.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.200
Are you sure
you'd know if I had?

17:43.900 --> 17:45.100
You're welcome to stay.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.800
You might learn something.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.800
Please turn to page 187,

17:59.800 --> 18:01.800
the Clausius-
Clapeyron equation.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.600
Oh, by the way, Professor Costin
said it'll be on the exam.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.200
I don't know, Sara.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.500
It's going to be tough
to get a warrant.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.100
I need Marlon West's DNA

18:15.100 --> 18:16.700
If his semen
is in Kira Dellinger,

18:16.700 --> 18:17.500
it puts him at the murder.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.100
Look, they had a known
sexual relationship,

18:19.100 --> 18:20.400
so there's no
evidence of rape.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.500
And I don't know
if you know this,

18:21.500 --> 18:22.600
but Marlon's mother
and father

18:22.600 --> 18:24.600
were killed in a car
accident last year.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.600
the judge ??? very sensitive to that.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.200
It could look
like harassment.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.400
Jim, are you going to talk
to the judge or not?

18:32.100 --> 18:33.900
Wow, you really
got it out for this kid.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.200
What's the deal here, Sara?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.200
Marlon West has killed before.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.100
Not according
to a jury of his peers.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.900
Did you have fun talking
to Kira Dellinger's parents?

18:41.900 --> 18:42.500
Excuse me?

18:42.500 --> 18:45.300
Must've been a lot of screaming
and crying and despair.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.200
Yeah, there usually is.
What's your point, Sara?

18:47.200 --> 18:51.200
My point is, if we had done
our job right the first time,

18:51.400 --> 18:52.800
Marlon West would be in jail,

18:52.800 --> 18:54.900
and Kira Dellinger
would still be alive.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
Talk to the judge.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.700
HPLC found high levels
of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid

19:03.700 --> 19:05.100
in Kira Dellinger's blood.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.100
GHB does occur
naturally in the body.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.400
You sure she
was drugged?

19:08.400 --> 19:09.000
Pretty sure.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.500
Started to metabolize in her
blood and urine when she died.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.100
That typically
indicates dosing.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.800
Okay, so then maybe she was
roofied, raped, then murdered.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.400
And no vaginal trauma because
she was too numb to resist.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.300
It's possible.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.900
You know, some people
take GHB recreationally.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.700
I didn't find any drug
paraphernalia in her room.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.100
It was pretty consistent with
a "straight edge" lifestyle.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.300
You know, that just
sounds like something

19:30.300 --> 19:33.100
a girl tells her parents in
order to make them feel better.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.800
I mean, we know she had sex.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.500
There was GHB in her system...

19:37.300 --> 19:39.100
I think you just need to test
everything in her room

19:39.100 --> 19:42.000
- that she may have ingested.
- Okay.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.700
you've got a band. you've got a blog.
(So this is her Twitter page.)

19:44.800 --> 19:46.700
Got e-mails, IMs,

19:46.700 --> 19:47.900
text messages.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.900
A minute-by-minute diary
of Kira Dellinger's life.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.800
With the last post a couple
hours before she died.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.100
What made you think
to check her Twitter page?

19:56.100 --> 19:58.300
Well, most date rape victims
know their assailants,

19:58.300 --> 20:00.400
and Kira was an active blogger,
so I figured

20:00.400 --> 20:01.800
if she was having trouble
with anyone,

20:01.800 --> 20:04.100
she'd probably
talk about it online.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.700
Some people just
don't value privacy.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.400
They don't expect privacy.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.400
They value openness.

20:10.700 --> 20:11.700
Whatever.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.200
Hmm.

20:15.800 --> 20:19.300
"It shouldn't suck when two boys
fight over you, but it does.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.600
"Drummerboy19 won't be a man.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.200
"And TorchX wants
what he can't have.

20:24.700 --> 20:26.300
They both bug."

20:26.700 --> 20:29.000
Looks like a virtual
love triangle to me.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.200
My guess is
DrummerBoy19 is Marlon.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.100
Well, TorchX responded to that.

20:37.500 --> 20:41.000
"KiraEdge, you know
I never give up."

20:41.300 --> 20:42.500
That could be a threat.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.200
Let's see
if this "TorchX"

20:44.400 --> 20:45.600
has a real name.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.200
Jordan Rockwell.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.300
I guess he values
openness, too.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.200
Mr. Rockwell,
do you know this girl?

21:02.500 --> 21:03.300
Yeah, sure.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
It's Kira Dellinger.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.700
When was the last
time you saw her?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.800
Uh... last night.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.500
Hmm. Where?

21:12.700 --> 21:13.800
At her place.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.700
We had sex.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.400
Nice. How did that happen?

21:18.600 --> 21:20.000
We used to date
in high school.

21:21.100 --> 21:23.900
Then we reconnected
online, and, uh...

21:24.300 --> 21:26.800
I came down to the campus
to check out her band.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.300
So she gave you a roll
for old times' sake.

21:29.600 --> 21:33.000
Well, I, uh...
I kind of helped her out

21:33.000 --> 21:34.700
with a boyfriend problem.

21:34.900 --> 21:36.100
Is this the problem?

21:37.300 --> 21:38.100
Yeah.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.700
Yeah, that's the guy.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.600
He was, uh...

21:42.900 --> 21:44.400
he was into her,
you know, but she...

21:44.400 --> 21:45.800
she was not into him.

21:45.900 --> 21:47.700
And he started
giving her static,

21:47.700 --> 21:51.600
so... I knocked the little
douche's teeth out.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.700
I guess she
kind of liked it,

21:53.700 --> 21:56.000
because she took me
back to her place after that.

21:56.700 --> 21:57.700
Then what?

21:58.300 --> 21:59.900
I want to know everything
up until the time

21:59.900 --> 22:02.200
when you wrapped your car
around that telephone pole.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.900
She fell asleep...

22:05.500 --> 22:07.100
and then I started feeling sick,

22:08.100 --> 22:11.100
so I, uh, got my car
to drive home.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.200
Then I got
really dizzy

22:14.300 --> 22:17.300
and, uh... wham.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.500
That's it.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.500
So she was alive
the last time you saw her.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.400
Wh-What do you mean,
"she was alive"?

22:28.200 --> 22:29.200
She's dead.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.600
According to Brass,
officers at the crash scene

22:35.600 --> 22:37.900
suspected that Jordan Rockwell
was under the influence,

22:38.000 --> 22:39.700
so the hospital
ran a tox panel.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.200
Positive for GHB.

22:41.800 --> 22:42.400
Really?

22:43.100 --> 22:46.000
So this guy roofies
himself along with Kira?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.200
Did they share a drink?

22:47.300 --> 22:47.700
Well, if they did,

22:47.700 --> 22:49.300
it wasn't in anything
we tested.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.300
Hodges ran all the water
bottles and soda cans

22:51.300 --> 22:52.600
we collected
from the room--

22:52.700 --> 22:54.000
no GHB in anything.

22:55.300 --> 22:56.100
Wait a minute.

22:57.700 --> 22:59.000
I think I know
what they shared.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.900
Kira and Jordan had
unprotected sex, right?

23:04.000 --> 23:04.800
Yes.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.700
That means...

23:09.900 --> 23:11.800
they both came in contact...

23:12.800 --> 23:13.800
with this.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.400
Kudos to you.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.400
The lube was indeed
laced with GHB.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.900
Not hard to do if you
know a little chemistry.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.600
Marlon takes chemistry.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.700
Hannah teaches it.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.800
We know Marlon's fingerprints
are on the lube tube.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.200
We know he was jealous.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.000
Maybe the GHB-lube was his way
of getting back at her.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.900
You know? Give a drug-free girl
a bad trip.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.500
Which became a
<i>really</i> bad trip.

23:38.100 --> 23:38.900
Yeah.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.600
But still, that doesn't

23:40.600 --> 23:42.800
conclusively put anybody
at the crime scene.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.400
There's one thing
we have that does.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.000
We can get a warrant for this.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.600
I'm telling you,
I didn't kill Kira.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.400
I've never lied to you.
Not once.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.300
You just never believe me.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.500
When I'm guilty,
you want me to be innocent.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.600
When I'm innocent,
you want me to be guilty.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.100
Hey, you know
what, Marlon?

24:05.700 --> 24:08.300
You can save it.
'Cause unlike most people,

24:08.800 --> 24:10.700
you're not going to get me
to underestimate you.

24:11.600 --> 24:15.200
I already know you're every bit
as smart as your sister,

24:15.900 --> 24:18.400
especially when it comes
to creating confusion.

24:20.300 --> 24:21.200
Open up.

24:23.500 --> 24:24.500
Bite down.

24:26.300 --> 24:27.300
Let it sit.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.500
He didn't kill Kira.
He cared about her.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.000
Hannah, what
makes you think

24:41.000 --> 24:43.100
that I would believe anything
that you tell me?

24:43.800 --> 24:45.800
I suppose I'm an optimist.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
College has been a difficult
adjustment for Marlon,

24:51.700 --> 24:54.300
especially after
we lost our parents.

24:54.300 --> 24:55.600
I'm sorry about that.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.900
You're not really, though.

25:00.300 --> 25:01.900
When will Marlon
be able to leave?

25:03.000 --> 25:05.800
Well, we're going to keep him
here as long as we possibly can.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.100
At least that's honest.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.800
It also seems

25:11.800 --> 25:13.400
a little vindictive.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.900
Given your brother's history,
I think it's pretty sensible.

25:18.300 --> 25:19.600
What's wrong, Sara?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.900
You're different
than you used to be.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.600
You're angry.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.600
And a little sad, too.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.100
Why?

25:31.300 --> 25:33.500
If you want to spend more time
with your brother,

25:34.200 --> 25:36.700
i recommend you invest in a lawyer, hannah.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.100
It's a physical match.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.800
Puts Marlon
at the scene.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.200
That's probably not enough
to put him in jail.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.400
I think I might be able
to help you out there.

26:03.700 --> 26:06.300
I found a Friend Agenda page
for Kira and Marlon's band,

26:06.300 --> 26:07.800
The Death Crusade.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.600
Seems like a lot of pictures
for a college band.

26:10.600 --> 26:11.900
Well, TDC, as
they're called,

26:11.900 --> 26:14.100
has quite a solid
fan base on campus.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.200
Hannah was there.

26:17.900 --> 26:19.700
Yeah. Marlon must've
been thrilled.

26:19.700 --> 26:22.000
What guy would like
having his little sister around

26:22.000 --> 26:23.500
to watch
as he gets his ass kicked

26:23.500 --> 26:25.100
in front of his girlfriend?

26:26.800 --> 26:29.300
From now on, just stay
away from me, psycho!

26:31.100 --> 26:32.700
Marlon, Marlon,
it's okay.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.300
Kira, don't do this to me!

26:36.200 --> 26:37.300
So this new guy

26:37.300 --> 26:39.600
pops Marlon in the mouth,
chips his tooth.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.400
Marlon's humiliated,
decides to take it out on Kira.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.400
Kills her, then tries to make it
look le a suicide,

26:45.800 --> 26:47.400
and in the midst
of their struggle,

26:47.700 --> 26:50.200
his tooth fragment
ends up in her fist?

26:53.900 --> 26:55.300
What are you looking for now?

26:56.700 --> 26:57.700
I'm not sure.

27:52.500 --> 27:53.400
What are you doing?

27:53.800 --> 27:56.900
I'm just, uh, taking a closer
look at Marlon's chipped tooth.

27:58.100 --> 28:01.300
Look at the orientation
of the fragment in the mouth.

28:04.800 --> 28:08.200
And now look at the way the tooth
ended up in Kira's right fist.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.600
Looks like it's backwards.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.400
I don't think
Kira punched Marlon.

28:18.900 --> 28:20.800
I think Hannah picked up
the tooth from a fight

28:20.800 --> 28:22.500
that Marlon had earlier
in the evening.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.500
And I think
she planted it on Kira.

28:26.800 --> 28:27.800
That's crazy.

28:28.900 --> 28:29.900
It's possible.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.900
This kid is spinning me
in circles again.

28:35.100 --> 28:38.000
You know, Sara, some cases,

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
some suspects
can get under your skin.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.400
Like this tooth.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.000
But you can't let it
make you feel bad.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.400
If you want,
we can put Nick on this.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.200
No. No, I, um...

28:52.300 --> 28:54.100
I need to finish this case.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.600
I'll be okay.

28:59.300 --> 29:00.200
Okay.

29:04.700 --> 29:07.200
What is that
in your hand?

29:08.500 --> 29:10.100
I think it was
a gum wrapper.

29:10.900 --> 29:11.700
It's wrong to litter.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.300
It's a piece of a tooth.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.600
The one that Kira Dellinger's
new boy-toy

29:15.600 --> 29:17.400
knocked out of
Marlon's head.

29:24.700 --> 29:27.600
<i>You had already spiked</i>
<i>Kira's lube with GHB.</i>

29:28.200 --> 29:29.800
<i>All you had to do was wait.</i>

29:32.600 --> 29:36.100
<i>A piece of his tooth</i>
<i>in her fist.</i>

29:39.400 --> 29:40.800
<i>A little bit of leverage.</i>

29:41.100 --> 29:42.400
<i>And your brother's</i>
<i>a killer again.</i>

29:51.200 --> 29:53.900
That's a highly unlikely series
of events.

29:54.100 --> 29:56.800
You don't expect me to confess
to something I didn't do?

29:57.000 --> 30:00.400
I am just putting you on notice.
You are not fooling me anymore.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.900
I think I know
why you're so angry, Sara.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.000
I did some research.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.100
I read about what
that serial killer did to you

30:09.200 --> 30:10.400
out in the desert,
under that car...

30:10.400 --> 30:11.700
We're talking about you, Hannah.

30:11.700 --> 30:16.000
It must've been so terrible being trapped like that
all alone.

30:16.300 --> 30:17.900
Did your life flash
in front of your eyes?

30:17.900 --> 30:20.500
- That is none of your business.
- You must've been so sad

30:20.500 --> 30:22.200
knowing that you were
gonna lose everyone

30:22.200 --> 30:23.600
- who mattered to you.
- Stop it, Hannah.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.400
Look, I know how it feels.

30:25.500 --> 30:26.900
One moment
my parents were alive,

30:26.900 --> 30:29.000
- and the next they were gone.
- Answer the question!

30:29.000 --> 30:33.300
My life changed in that moment.
All that I have left is Marlon.

30:33.300 --> 30:35.500
Why would I do
anything to hurt him?

30:37.200 --> 30:38.700
Stop playing games with me.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.400
You're the one
who's playing games.

30:48.700 --> 30:49.400
Hey.

30:49.800 --> 30:50.800
What are you doing here?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.400
I was going to ask you
the same question.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.700
Listen, I'm worried
about you.

30:53.700 --> 30:55.500
That just makes this worse.

30:55.700 --> 30:58.400
I-I can't talk about
this right now. I can't.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.400
- Just stay in touch, okay?
- okay.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.400
What happened?
Her husband attack her again?

31:21.800 --> 31:23.300
No. She came in
voluntarily.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.800
It took some convincing, but
she's agreed to go to a shelter.

31:25.800 --> 31:26.900
She won't stay.

31:27.400 --> 31:28.000
Maybe not.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.600
But at least now
she has a chance.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.800
Look, I did it all
on my own time, no OT.

31:34.500 --> 31:35.400
I know it's not the way
you do things,

31:35.400 --> 31:36.900
but I think it's
part of the job.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.800
At least, that's how
I want it to be. For me.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.200
Why would Hannah
want to frame me?

31:50.400 --> 31:52.300
I don't know, Marlon.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.000
She's <i>your</i> sister.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.800
Hannah's always
been kinda weird.

31:55.800 --> 31:59.100
But since the trial...
and after our parents died,

31:59.100 --> 32:01.000
she's started
getting really weird.

32:01.300 --> 32:02.200
Like how?

32:03.600 --> 32:04.600
Really clingy, I guess.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.100
Always wanting to hang
around with me.

32:06.100 --> 32:08.200
And that changed
when you met Kira?

32:09.100 --> 32:09.900
Yeah.

32:10.700 --> 32:11.900
But not for Hannah.

32:18.900 --> 32:20.400
Get out of here,
you little freak!

32:21.000 --> 32:22.400
Aren't you gonna
get her out of here?!

32:23.400 --> 32:26.700
Oh, I hope you two are really
happy together. Freaks!

32:26.700 --> 32:29.000
<i>After that, Kira said</i>
<i>she was done with me.</i>

32:29.400 --> 32:32.300
Marlon... don't be sad.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.700
She doesn't deserve you.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.900
You're right. She doesn't.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.800
You want to help me
teach Kira a lesson?

32:45.800 --> 32:48.400
I asked Hannah to teach me
how to make GHB,

32:48.400 --> 32:50.000
and how to get
it into Kira.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.900
I just wanted
to mess her up a bit.

32:53.900 --> 32:57.100
I snuck it into Kira's room a
few days ago; I still had a key.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.400
Hannah must've made a copy.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.800
I believe you, Marlon.

33:01.800 --> 33:02.700
I really do.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.300
But the only thing
that a jury's going to see

33:05.500 --> 33:08.300
is your prints on the lube,
your prints on the windowsill,

33:08.400 --> 33:09.700
and another dead girl.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.300
Why is Hannah
doing this to me?

33:11.500 --> 33:12.300
I don't know.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.300
All I know is...

33:15.300 --> 33:18.500
you don't deserve
to take the fall for this.

33:19.100 --> 33:21.000
And the question is...

33:21.600 --> 33:24.100
are you going to let your sister
get away with this

33:24.600 --> 33:28.300
and spend the rest
of your life in jail?

33:28.900 --> 33:31.600
If Hannah wants me in jail,
that's where I'm going to be.

33:32.300 --> 33:33.900
There's nothing
I can do about it.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.000
There is one thing.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.500
One foot away from the bars
at all times.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.600
And no contact,
you understand?

33:49.900 --> 33:51.500
Yeah, I understand.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.100
Thanks for coming.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.100
The police said
you needed me.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.300
Yeah, I do.

34:03.800 --> 34:07.500
I need to know...
what I did to deserve this.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.100
You killed Kira.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.199
We both know I didn't do that.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.300
You look a little flushed,
Marlon.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.100
Are you feeling all right?

34:24.600 --> 34:26.400
No, I'm not feeling all right.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.900
Kira always brought out
the worst in you.

34:33.500 --> 34:37.000
Hannah, they're going to put me
away for the rest of my life.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.100
The evidence is against you,

34:42.199 --> 34:44.900
particularly given
your history of violence.

34:45.000 --> 34:45.900
Please...

34:47.000 --> 34:48.800
after everything
I've done for you,

34:49.199 --> 34:51.699
after everything we've done
for each other,

34:53.100 --> 34:55.199
at least tell me why.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.500
Because I love you.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.600
And I love you, too.

35:08.300 --> 35:09.200
No.

35:10.900 --> 35:11.800
You don't.

35:14.500 --> 35:15.600
But you will.

35:19.500 --> 35:22.400
I promise,
I'll visit you every week.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.100
We're done.

35:38.300 --> 35:39.300
Well, he gave it a shot,

35:39.300 --> 35:41.600
but she is way out
of his league.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.400
She's out of mine, too.

35:57.700 --> 35:58.600
Hi.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.300
Okay, what's up?

36:08.000 --> 36:09.100
I'm sorry.

36:11.700 --> 36:12.800
I've been, uh...

36:19.000 --> 36:20.200
This is Sara.

36:26.800 --> 36:27.900
I'll be right there.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.100
Guard found him
about an hour ago.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.900
Said he didn't
even make a sound.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.900
You need to talk
to me again?

37:17.100 --> 37:17.900
I do.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.400
I know that you killed
Kira Dellinger.

37:22.200 --> 37:23.400
I just can't prove it.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.600
That must be
frustrating for you.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.400
Hannah, Marlon's dead.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Wow.

37:35.400 --> 37:39.200
That's a really sad
and desperate ploy, Sara.

37:39.900 --> 37:41.000
It's beneath you.

37:46.900 --> 37:48.500
He was doing well
here, wasn't he?

37:48.500 --> 37:51.200
Making friends, joining a band,
falling in love.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.800
But you're still a freak,
just like high school.

37:54.300 --> 37:56.300
You're lying.
No. This is a lie.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.200
His world got bigger,
and yours stayed the same,

37:59.200 --> 38:00.300
and you killed Kira

38:00.300 --> 38:03.100
so you could keep him
all to yourself, didn't you?

38:03.100 --> 38:04.200
It's a lie!

38:04.600 --> 38:06.400
No... it's a lie!

38:06.700 --> 38:07.700
It's a lie!

38:07.700 --> 38:09.600
This is a... lie!

38:10.400 --> 38:11.400
Stop it!

38:15.300 --> 38:16.900
???

38:19.700 --> 38:20.900
Marlon...

38:21.800 --> 38:25.200
he-he-he can't
leave me all alone.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.600
Judy, have you seen Sara?

41:09.800 --> 41:10.900
She left a few minutes ago, sir,

41:10.900 --> 41:12.800
but she did leave
something for you.

41:15.300 --> 41:16.100
Thank you.

41:24.000 --> 41:24.900
<i>Gil...</i>

41:25.100 --> 41:26.500
<i>You know I love you.</i>

41:27.800 --> 41:29.700
<i>I feel I've loved you forever.</i>

41:30.800 --> 41:31.500
<i>Lately...</i>

41:32.000 --> 41:33.900
<i>I haven't been feeling</i>
<i>very well.</i>

41:34.500 --> 41:37.400
<i>Truth be told, I'm tired.</i>

41:37.900 --> 41:40.100
<i>Out in the desert,</i>
<i>under that car that night,</i>

41:40.100 --> 41:44.000
<i>I realized something, and I</i>
<i>haven't been able to shake it.</i>

41:44.800 --> 41:46.300
<i>Since my father died,</i>

41:46.500 --> 41:49.500
<i>I've spent almost</i>
<i>my entire life with ghosts.</i>

41:49.700 --> 41:52.900
<i>We've been like close friends,</i>
<i>and out there in the desert,</i>

41:52.900 --> 41:56.400
<i>it occurred to me that it was </i>
<i>time for me to bury them.</i>

41:57.300 --> 41:58.700
<i>I can't do that here.</i>

41:59.900 --> 42:01.300
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

42:02.700 --> 42:05.100
<i>No matter how hard</i>
<i>I try to fight it off,</i>

42:05.100 --> 42:09.100
<i>I'm left with the feeling</i>
<i>that... I have to go.</i>

42:10.000 --> 42:11.700
<i>I have no idea where I'm going,</i>

42:12.900 --> 42:14.600
<i>but I know I have to do this.</i>

42:15.400 --> 42:18.100
<i>If I don't, I'm afraid</i>
<i>I'll self-destruct,</i>

42:18.100 --> 42:22.000
<i>and worse, you'll be there</i>
<i>to see it happen.</i>

42:23.300 --> 42:24.400
<i>Be safe.</i>

42:25.800 --> 42:28.600
<i>Know that I tried</i>
<i>very hard to stay.</i>

42:29.500 --> 42:31.800
<i>Know that you are</i>
<i>my one and only.</i>

42:32.100 --> 42:34.700
<i>I will miss you</i>
<i>with every beat of my heart.</i>

42:35.600 --> 42:38.700
<i>Our life together was the only</i>
<i>home I've ever really had.</i>

42:39.400 --> 42:41.400
<i>I wouldn't trade it</i>
<i>for anything.</i>

42:42.400 --> 42:43.400
<i>I love you.</i>

42:44.200 --> 42:45.400
<i>I always will.</i>

42:47.100 --> 42:48.600
<i>Good-bye.</i>
