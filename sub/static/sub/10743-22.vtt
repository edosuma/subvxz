    If you've got a problem,
maybe I could help you with it.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.597
      The only person who
      could help me is me.

21:23.599 --> 21:25.216
         More hot sake?

21:25.218 --> 21:26.650
 How could you let me do that?

21:27.887 --> 21:29.787
     I must have missed
   part of the conversation.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.888
  How could I let you do what?

21:30.890 --> 21:33.023
          Fine friend
     you turned out to be.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.158
    Well...I must have been
        out of my mind.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.861
   I can't go on without her.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.146
     You mean you've changed
            your mind?

21:39.148 --> 21:41.148
             Yeah. I'm gonna
               stop her.

21:41.150 --> 21:43.483
I wish I knew what everybody
was talking about?

21:43.485 --> 21:44.885
           It can't be 9:30--
             Uh, pardon me.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.687
        Could you tell me
     what time it is, please?

21:46.689 --> 21:49.256
Mm. It's, uh,
one minute past midnight.

21:53.963 --> 21:55.295
     [SIGHS]

21:55.297 --> 21:57.998
Here's to the best genie
a master ever had.

21:59.101 --> 22:00.117
                       Yeah.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.101
              Jeannie?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.711
      Haji, I want to
        talk to you.

22:27.713 --> 22:29.813
         You can't have
         Jeannie back.

22:29.815 --> 22:31.582
       There's, um, been
    some kind of a mistake.

22:31.584 --> 22:34.384
   Something went wrong
      with my watch.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.587
Now, it's up to me to decide
if I want to send her back.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.989
And I've decided I do not
want to send her back.

22:40.559 --> 22:41.958
Are you listening?

22:43.762 --> 22:45.362
All right, I'll tell you
what I'll do.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.696
I'll fight you for her.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.732
But I warn you, I'm
trained in unarmed combat.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.066
Thanks, Jeannie.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.835
  [LAUGHING]
   Jeannie.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.838
   Jeannie.
  You escaped!

22:53.840 --> 22:54.889
          No, master.

22:54.891 --> 22:56.373
    How did you get away
       from the Haji?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.841
        I did not go to Haji.

22:57.843 --> 23:00.460
 Yeah-- But you-- But you said
 that at midnight, you had to--

23:00.462 --> 23:02.363
          Yes, master.
     Midnight, Haji's time.

23:02.365 --> 23:04.531
     Midnight, Haji's time.

23:05.368 --> 23:06.700
               Well, I, uh--

23:06.702 --> 23:09.102
        I set your watches back.

23:09.104 --> 23:10.771
    You set our watches back?

23:10.773 --> 23:13.741
Well, I did not think
you wanted me to go, really.

23:13.743 --> 23:17.611
And-- And-- And anyway,
it-- It is too late now.

23:17.613 --> 23:19.713
Oh ye-- Too late--
Too late, yes. Uh...

23:19.715 --> 23:21.782
Uh, that is,
until next year.

23:21.784 --> 23:23.283
                   Yes.

23:23.285 --> 23:25.486
                 Do you mind
                  very much?

23:25.488 --> 23:27.721
Well, I guess I could put up
with you for another year.

23:27.723 --> 23:29.055
                  Oh, I am glad.

23:29.057 --> 23:31.525
Yeah, but you remember,
you're gonna keep your promises.

23:31.527 --> 23:34.227
You're gonna stay in your bottle
and not interfere in my life.

23:34.229 --> 23:35.962
              Oh, that is right,
                    master.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.166
Welcome home.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.403
              Oh. Thank you,
                 master.

          [BOTH LAUGH]

23:45.207 --> 23:47.040
                 Okay, now,
            back in the bottle.

23:47.042 --> 23:48.308
  Oh, where are
   you going?

23:48.310 --> 23:50.176
        Oh, well, I'm going back
           to The Tokyo House.

23:50.178 --> 23:51.812
              I have a date,
                remember?

23:51.814 --> 23:53.614
 And you are going
    back there?

23:53.616 --> 23:55.282
                 Yeah, sure.
                 Good night.

24:02.341 --> 24:03.507
             Wait.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.275
            Jeannie, what do you
             think you're doing?

24:05.277 --> 24:08.512
It is past midnight, master,
and you should be in bed.

24:08.514 --> 24:12.182
You have a hard day tomorrow,
and you should be fresh.

24:13.485 --> 24:14.502
Sleep well.

24:15.354 --> 24:16.854
             Well--
              Oh.

24:18.107 --> 24:19.473
I will see you
in the morning.

              Jeannie, now,
            you cut this out.
