WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:03.667
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.754 --> 00:06.291
I don't see another option.

00:06.382 --> 00:08.247
Scorpius has the knowledge
from my brain

00:08.342 --> 00:10.833
and I'm not gonna let him
shaft the universe with it.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.385
I'm going to stop Scorpius.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.427
Welcome.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.722
I grant you, John, and
your companions,

00:16.809 --> 00:23.430
full diplomatic rights,
immunities and courtesies
whilst aboard this vessel.

00:23.524 --> 00:27.608
Those wearing the bracelets
will feel each other's pain.

00:29.238 --> 00:30.739
(yells)

00:30.823 --> 00:32.154
And if one is killed?

00:32.241 --> 00:33.947
Both will be dead.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.445
Crichton:
Let's test the jewelry.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.653
( groans )

00:38.748 --> 00:40.739
The rift between us is
finally breached.

00:40.833 --> 00:43.245
Scorpius stole your command.

00:43.336 --> 00:45.418
I knew he squeezed you
out of power.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.335
What else do you know?

00:47.423 --> 00:49.163
You could have come back.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.169
I didn't want to come back.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.340
It's magnificent.

00:52.428 --> 00:54.965
He's harmless. His weapons
have been deactivated.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.763
That's ship's biologics are
on minimal autosupport.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.226
All its other systems are dead.

00:59.310 --> 01:00.925
These are design specs, right?

01:01.020 --> 01:05.764
To create an external field
that stabilizes the wormhole
before entry.

01:05.858 --> 01:11.069
Your project has cost us dearly
and yielded nothing.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.111
The equations we need
are in here.

01:13.199 --> 01:14.154
Don't touch me.

01:14.242 --> 01:17.200
You give me what I want,
or I swear,

01:17.286 --> 01:23.327
I will keep you alive so that
you can witness your
homeworld's destruction!

01:24.252 --> 01:26.743
And now, on Farscape.

01:28.339 --> 01:29.545
Look at it!

01:29.632 --> 01:32.874
Get the hell off me,
you son of a bitch!

01:32.969 --> 01:35.176
You listen to me, John.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.219
I don't care about
your homeworld.

01:37.306 --> 01:41.345
Your entire species, live, die,
means nothing to me.

01:41.435 --> 01:45.974
What interests me is that
they matter to you!

01:46.065 --> 01:50.354
You think holding a frickin'
gun on my planet is going to
motivate me to help you?!

01:50.444 --> 01:54.232
l have run out of time.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.403
(grunts)

01:55.491 --> 01:57.573
Oh, don't stop.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.322
Let's see how much pain
you can take.

02:00.830 --> 02:04.118
( screams )

02:04.208 --> 02:07.075
That Commandant bitch will
return here any time.

02:07.169 --> 02:12.755
I must be able to report
success or she's going to scrap
my wormhole project

02:12.842 --> 02:18.337
and soon, the Scarrans will
rule half this galaxy!

02:18.431 --> 02:22.424
Oh, Grasshopper.
You're so screwed.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.509
( screams )

02:29.483 --> 02:34.318
If I am screwed, John,

02:34.405 --> 02:38.148
things around here are
going to get very ugly.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.963
Aeryn:
But if Grayza's going to stop
the experiment in a few days then we have already succeeded.

02:58.054 --> 03:00.170
No. Scorpius is in
Captain Queeg mode.

03:00.264 --> 03:03.051
Somebody's stolen his
strawberries and he's not gonna
let his pet project die.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.928
How's he planning to
stop Grayza?

03:05.019 --> 03:09.012
We're talking about Scorpius.
You prepared to bet against him?

03:09.106 --> 03:13.691
Bialar. You look tense. Let's
take a little steam in that
restorative chamber.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.229
So we're agreed.

03:18.324 --> 03:20.736
We stay no longer. We go.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.362
Agreed.

03:22.453 --> 03:23.909
Agreed.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.614
All right folks, gather round.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.414
New deal.

03:29.502 --> 03:32.335
This whole Commandant Grayza's
strong arm routine changes
everything.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.376
We agree.

03:33.464 --> 03:36.297
Rygel:
This could all get nasty
very quickly.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.217
Absolutely. But it might not be
nasty enough to put a spike

03:39.303 --> 03:41.168
into Scorpy's wormhole project
once and for all.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.219
From the scuttlebutt
on the ship,

03:43.307 --> 03:46.390
this Grayza's got Scorpius's
mivonks in one hezmana
of a vice.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.639
Are we all on the
same page here?

03:52.733 --> 03:56.567
We came to permanently sabotage
Scorpy's project.

03:56.654 --> 04:00.112
Now, I've been trying to kill
it from the inside, but we
have run out of time.

04:00.199 --> 04:03.362
We have one option left.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.363
Only one.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.829
We blow up the Command Carrier.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.581
( laughs )

04:22.847 --> 04:25.213
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

04:25.307 --> 04:29.266
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

04:29.353 --> 04:30.684
I'm trying to stay alive...

04:30.771 --> 04:32.682
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

04:32.773 --> 04:35.435
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.232
If you can hear me...
Beware.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.310
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

04:39.405 --> 04:41.862
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

04:41.949 --> 04:46.409
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.872
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

04:48.956 --> 04:51.413
Not show them...
You exist...

04:51.500 --> 04:55.209
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.239
Jool:
Blow up the Command Carrier?

05:29.330 --> 05:30.570
The entire Command Carrier?

05:30.664 --> 05:34.373
Crichton:
All of Scorpy's data
is on this ship.

05:40.090 --> 05:44.129
This boat is the Peacekeeper
Wormhole Project.

05:44.220 --> 05:47.633
But this Carrier's huge.
Over a metra long.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.964
Is it possible to blow up
the whole ship?

05:50.059 --> 05:51.515
It's armed to the teeth.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.558
We can blow the
munitions store.

05:53.646 --> 05:56.604
Hell, we can stick a banana
in the tailpipe.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.942
I do not care how we do it,
but we do it.

05:59.026 --> 06:03.690
There are over 50,000 men, women
and children aboard this ship.

06:07.409 --> 06:11.277
Then we find a way to get them
off before we blow it up.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.578
John, there's no way...

06:12.665 --> 06:16.283
Is this not what we
came here to do?

06:24.927 --> 06:26.087
Crais.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.555
You commanded this ship.
Can we destroy it?

06:30.349 --> 06:32.340
It's possible.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.141
I'll need to see the specs on
any modifications Scorpius
has made,

06:35.229 --> 06:39.438
and any redistribution of
power and fuel since
I was in command.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.265
Good. We have a start.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.568
And we will find a way to
get the people off.

06:50.286 --> 06:51.822
Guys...

06:51.912 --> 06:53.868
we can do this.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.292
And we have to try.

07:00.296 --> 07:04.164
Rygel:
I did see what the Scarrans
were able to do.

07:04.258 --> 07:09.594
Even if, by some wild miracle,
I manage to regain my throne,

07:09.680 --> 07:13.593
lwon't hold it for long if the
Peacekeepers have this
technology.

07:13.684 --> 07:18.428
I know what horrible destruction
wormholes can wreak.

07:18.522 --> 07:21.138
Nobody should wield such power.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.815
Nobody.

07:23.902 --> 07:27.235
Announcer:
All available tech units to
Docking Bay Two.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.651
I'm on my way to the
Leviathan hybrid.

07:30.743 --> 07:32.529
Not anymore, sir.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.326
The hybrid is dead.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.324
There is no reason to
deny me access.

07:36.415 --> 07:39.703
Scorpius's orders are
my reason.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.972
Scorpius Clone:
This is all very pleasant, John,
but shouldn't we be working?

07:56.143 --> 07:59.431
Or at least, well,
pretending to work?

07:59.521 --> 08:00.897
Would he do it?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.596
Eh?

08:02.691 --> 08:05.558
Oh. Would Scorpius actually
attack Earth

08:05.653 --> 08:08.645
if you fail in delivering the
wormhole answers?

08:12.534 --> 08:14.070
( chuckles )

08:17.373 --> 08:23.790
Would he set out on a 60 cycle
mission to destroy an
insignificant planet? Huh!

08:23.879 --> 08:27.542
I would never underestimate
Scorpius's resolve for
retribution, John.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.214
If he feels he's been...

08:29.301 --> 08:30.290
No, wait...
-Hey!

08:30.386 --> 08:32.422
Took your hand off.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.427
Got any threes?

08:43.190 --> 08:45.397
Ah-ha. Yes.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.146
So tell me, John.

08:48.237 --> 08:52.901
If you do develop wormhole
travel and gain the ability
to return home,

08:52.991 --> 08:56.154
would you really destroy
that information?

08:56.245 --> 08:57.325
Got any sixes?

08:57.413 --> 08:59.699
G0 fish! Ah-ha!

08:59.790 --> 09:01.997
Oh, yes!

09:02.084 --> 09:04.325
Co-Kura:
Crichton... Crichton?

09:05.629 --> 09:07.836
Crichton?

09:07.923 --> 09:12.257
Crichton, you're no longer
writing on the tablet.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.426
Crichton... Crichton...

09:21.395 --> 09:23.135
Oh my Jenset, look what
you've done.

09:23.230 --> 09:27.894
l... I think you've unlocked the
fifth level coupling anomalies!

09:30.362 --> 09:32.478
So that's how it works.

09:32.573 --> 09:35.986
I must get these figures
plugged in immediately.

09:37.161 --> 09:38.276
We're close.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.907
Yes. Oh, yes!

09:47.963 --> 09:49.874
I can do this.

10:03.312 --> 10:08.682
Disarming him was the final
step towards his resurrection.

10:08.776 --> 10:14.112
Your experience with Talyn
will be invaluable to
making that happen.

10:14.198 --> 10:16.189
We must get you back
aboard Talyn.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.399
They'd never let me
stay with him.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.790
We don't know that.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.285
Not unless I have
something to trade.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.427
Sir.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.270
A talk with Crais, sir.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.153
You have something for me?

11:00.244 --> 11:01.950
Yes. A demand.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.369
Get him out of... get him
out of my sight!

11:04.456 --> 11:09.325
I demand that I suffer no
repercussions for any of my
actions during exile.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.627
I demand assurances that the
Leviathan hybrid will be
resurrected.

11:12.714 --> 11:16.298
That I will be leader of that
project working alongside
Lieutenant Larell.

11:16.385 --> 11:17.921
Stop.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.797
Let him speak.

11:21.431 --> 11:25.549
You have something comparable,
I assume.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.807
More than comparable.

11:29.898 --> 11:34.688
Any deal you strike with me may
not prove enforceable once
Commandant Grayza returns.

11:36.071 --> 11:38.938
If you delineate my requests
in an Executive Order,

11:39.032 --> 11:41.114
signed while you are still in
command of this vessel,

11:41.201 --> 11:47.197
High Command must honor it,
no matter what dishonor
you may endure.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.246
I accept your terms.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.122
Release him.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.298
Scorpius,

12:05.392 --> 12:08.680
Crichton has no intention
of helping you.

12:11.648 --> 12:18.736
He is determined that there is
only one way to stop you and
your experiments with finality.

12:21.033 --> 12:28.405
He is conspiring with some of
Moya's crew to destroy this
Command Carrier.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.884
(children shouting)

12:55.943 --> 12:58.275
Child:
Help! Let me go!

12:58.362 --> 12:59.852
Aeryn:
Hey!

13:00.614 --> 13:03.572
Ow... Ow...

13:05.744 --> 13:07.200
Got an injury?

13:07.287 --> 13:08.663
Yes.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.453
Let's have a look.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.246
( sniffles )

13:12.334 --> 13:14.245
All right.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.418
Well, this may sting a little.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.083
When I was your age,

13:19.174 --> 13:23.258
do you have any idea how many
times l was ambushed when
I wasn't ready?

13:24.972 --> 13:26.803
Let me see.

13:29.601 --> 13:30.932
Hmm... Hmm... Hmm...
(girl giggles)

13:31.019 --> 13:32.930
Henta:
Cadet. At service, now!

13:33.397 --> 13:34.807
Henta.

13:38.193 --> 13:40.400
Henta:
Let it bleed. Let it scar.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.352
You'll want it. Go.

13:44.783 --> 13:47.399
Don't make her soft, Aeryn.

13:48.537 --> 13:51.324
So much you don't know, Henta.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.752
What are you doing here?

13:59.840 --> 14:01.330
We need to talk.
There's a problem.

14:01.425 --> 14:02.881
Follow me.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.177
We've secured the information
about the ship's modifications.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.303
We got word on the life pods.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.930
Great. Let's get the
information, get it to Crichton

14:14.021 --> 14:15.682
and get the frell out of here.

14:25.657 --> 14:31.402
Co-Kura:
The equations they're
flowing from you like a Walteran fountain.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.828
( laughing softly)

14:35.375 --> 14:37.161
This is wonderful, Crichton.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.208
(laughing)

14:46.511 --> 14:49.674
It seems your subconscious
has blossomed.

14:49.765 --> 14:55.681
Despite yourself, you are
delivering the secrets that
will allow me to succeed.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.605
And, ah,

14:57.689 --> 15:00.146
no more distractions, John.

15:00.233 --> 15:05.273
Your plot against this ship
has failed. Your friends
are in custody.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.288
(yelling)

15:23.090 --> 15:25.172
(grunts)

15:25.258 --> 15:26.998
Crichton:
You are dead!

15:27.094 --> 15:30.632
You are a dead man, Crais!

15:30.722 --> 15:36.342
lf Grayza insists that they all
complete their sentences as
prisoners, then so be it.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.267
No, no, no.
I forced 'em to do it.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.346
I demand you let them go,
if want me to keep working.

15:40.440 --> 15:45.309
You demand nothing! You get me
my wormholes or I swear,

15:45.403 --> 15:48.236
|Wi|| kill them all.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.279
(grunts)

15:55.705 --> 15:58.412
(huffing)

16:00.669 --> 16:02.284
Jool:
We didn't actually do anything.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.119
I mean, all they have
is our intent.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.750
They're Peacekeepers, Jool.

16:05.841 --> 16:09.004
They're not into justice,
they're into enforcement.

16:09.928 --> 16:12.715
Hey. Come on.

16:12.806 --> 16:15.889
We've been in worse scrapes
than this.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.683
l was a Peacekeeper prisoner
for eight cycles.

16:18.770 --> 16:24.857
You don't think that I spent
every single solar day
trying to escape?

16:24.943 --> 16:29.903
Last time it took me
130 cycles to escape.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.447
Jool:
130 cycles?!

16:32.534 --> 16:35.867
Huh, I was lucky.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.199
(sighs)

16:41.168 --> 16:43.250
Crichton:
You wanted to see me?

16:46.339 --> 16:47.499
No, stop it!

16:47.591 --> 16:49.547
It's safe to talk here and
you need to hear this.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.716
I need to kick his ass.
He sold us out!

16:51.803 --> 16:55.091
Crais:
You can't destroy this ship by
simply throwing a few switches.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.718
So you set 'em up.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.639
Crais:
No Crichton, I did not.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.308
I needed the distraction

17:00.395 --> 17:04.229
so that Scorpius would believe
that the plot against
him had failed.

17:04.316 --> 17:06.728
I kept Aeryn safe because
I need her.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.649
You should come up with
a newer line.

17:08.737 --> 17:12.275
And you should listen
to him now.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.277
Crais:
All that l have cared
for have gone.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.576
My parents were taken away from
me, my brother dead.

17:18.663 --> 17:24.374
So now | live, I plan, I do,
all in the service of my
own interests.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.952
In that, I believe, lam not
unique in the universe.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.709
Snap this up.
I gotta get back.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.585
Despite all of this,

17:31.676 --> 17:36.261
I understand the power of the
technology that Scorpius is
attempting to harness.

17:36.348 --> 17:40.808
I understand the horror that
will wash over this galaxy if
anyone wields this weapon.

17:40.894 --> 17:45.854
And last of all, | now know
that I am the only individual
capable of stopping it.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.731
Have fun.

17:51.821 --> 17:55.655
Listen, we are all on the same
team. We all want this
ship destroyed.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.279
Crais:
And the one way to do that...

17:58.370 --> 18:00.326
is with Talyn.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.322
Crais is proposing that
he and Talyn

18:03.416 --> 18:07.500
Starburst while still inside
the Command Carrier hangar.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.329
Crais:
The Carrier will
collapse upon itself.

18:10.423 --> 18:14.132
Outer decks first,
central core last.

18:14.219 --> 18:18.337
It will take at least half
an am for the ship to
fully implode.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.673
Giving the crew time
to abandon ship.

18:27.732 --> 18:31.099
Tell me you believe this?

18:31.194 --> 18:33.685
Do you have a plan to
destroy the ship?

18:38.576 --> 18:40.157
Not yet.

18:40.245 --> 18:44.033
D'Argo and the others are
probably in a holding cell and
I can find them.

18:46.584 --> 18:49.075
Where do we meet up with
you and Talyn?

18:50.505 --> 18:53.167
You don't.

18:53.258 --> 18:56.967
Starburst in a confined space
where the energy can't
dissipate...

18:57.846 --> 18:59.256
Hmm.

18:59.347 --> 19:02.305
It will be the hero's death
that Talyn deserves.

19:08.565 --> 19:09.850
You're gonna die?

19:09.941 --> 19:12.318
I will need a, uh...

19:12.402 --> 19:16.862
significant distraction to keep
Scorpius occupied.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.736
Crais!

19:30.795 --> 19:32.706
I'll get you one.

19:36.968 --> 19:40.756
Announcer:
19 through 27 to Cargo Bay 7.

19:40.847 --> 19:45.136
F11217 to Dock Bay 6.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.197
Yo, Harrison. Get your shoes on.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.525
We're going on a little
trip to my module.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.451
My dear Crichton...

20:06.247 --> 20:07.828
You smell this?

20:08.583 --> 20:10.323
Wormholes.

20:10.418 --> 20:13.626
We are this close.

20:13.713 --> 20:17.205
But you gotta get Scorpy to
call off the watchdogs.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.461
Crichton. Crichton!

20:19.552 --> 20:20.632
Crichton.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.336
What's happening?
-Nothing.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.138
You forget how well I know you.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.717
I can tell you're about
to do something.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.894
You do know me very well.

20:35.443 --> 20:39.982
If I suspect you're conspiring
against Scorpius,
I must report it.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.359
Larell...

20:43.785 --> 20:46.948
if you suspect anything,
you must report it.

20:47.038 --> 20:50.405
Do not be disloyal to
Scorpius in any way.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.492
Tell me. Tell me.

20:56.131 --> 20:58.292
Tell Scorpius it's not
going to work.

20:58.383 --> 21:02.251
Next time he sends someone
to spy on me, send someone
I care about!

21:16.317 --> 21:17.693
Co-Kura:
Crichton!

21:17.777 --> 21:19.438
Crichton, we must hurry.

21:19.529 --> 21:22.020
Scorpius said we must not
stay on Moya long.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.980
Yeah, yeah. I'm on my way.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.736
Quickly, check the stabilizers.

21:25.827 --> 21:28.534
Pilot:
Moya understands.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.907
She says it is best this way.

21:30.999 --> 21:36.164
Talyn was always destined
for a violent end.

21:36.254 --> 21:39.621
This then at least will
be a noble one.

21:41.593 --> 21:46.303
We may never see any
of you again.

21:48.391 --> 21:54.637
Pilot, just be ready to
Starburst if you don't see us
hauling ass toward you.

22:01.029 --> 22:03.941
You give Moya my love.

22:05.408 --> 22:08.741
And her love to you.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.498
As well as mine.

22:33.728 --> 22:36.014
Co-Kura:
Check the nose cone.

22:36.105 --> 22:40.018
Crichton:
Co-Kura, make sure those
sensors are far away from the head strut.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.361
Attach one to either side.

22:43.655 --> 22:47.614
I allowed you to get this
primitive ship.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.282
How is this going to get
me what I want?

22:50.370 --> 22:51.860
Read the middle finger, Scorpy.

22:51.955 --> 22:55.197
l have a thought forming in
my head about why this
"primitive ship"

22:55.291 --> 22:58.374
with no shielding allows me
to survive wormholes.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.622
I'm gonna check it out.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.122
Which pilot is ready
for deployment?

23:04.217 --> 23:05.172
Oh, no.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.841
No, no, nobody flies
her but me.

23:06.928 --> 23:09.761
One of your bozos screws up
and bye bye, birdie.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.224
(flipping switches)

23:12.308 --> 23:14.219
You could die, John.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.892
Yes, I could die.

23:16.980 --> 23:21.223
If I don't kick this project in
the ass before Commandant
Cleavage gets back,

23:21.317 --> 23:23.694
she's going to execute me
anyway, right?

23:24.279 --> 23:25.894
What?

23:25.989 --> 23:28.947
Are you worried if I turn to
Silly Putty, so do you?

23:32.245 --> 23:34.327
Why don't you come with me?

23:35.415 --> 23:39.158
Come on, Grasshopper.
Come with me.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.914
You spent your life in
search of wormholes.

23:42.005 --> 23:45.042
Let me introduce you to one,
up close and personal.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.552
Unless of course you're
too scared.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.435
Co-Kura, how are the
sensors reading?

24:07.530 --> 24:10.397
All sensor data flowing
at maximum.

24:12.035 --> 24:14.117
All right, Scorp.
You ready to rumble?

24:14.203 --> 24:16.285
Oh yes, John.

24:18.708 --> 24:22.326
Crichton:
We are approaching
optimal attitude.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.875
Co-Kura:
All data still flowing.

24:31.137 --> 24:35.255
Crichton:
Entering the wormhole in
ten microts on my mark.

24:38.311 --> 24:41.098
Co-Kura:
Check your drag
coefficient, Crichton.

24:48.613 --> 24:51.400
Hey, what do you think?

24:53.076 --> 24:55.283
This is without
description, John.

24:59.374 --> 25:01.285
It's a real Kodak moment.

25:02.877 --> 25:06.415
Co-Kura:
Sensor readings are
starting to oscillate.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.001
Crichton, we're detecting
rantak thrust.

25:13.096 --> 25:15.382
(rumbling)

25:15.473 --> 25:18.135
What is that, John?
-I don't know.

25:18.226 --> 25:20.968
Co-Kura:
You're approaching a zone of
possible instability.

25:21.062 --> 25:23.678
All right, buckle up back there.
We got a little problem.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.311
What is causing this, John?

25:34.492 --> 25:39.361
You may not know it, sir, but
my orders have been changed
by Scorpius himself.

25:39.455 --> 25:43.573
He said if you tried to board
the hybrid again, l was
authorized to shoot to kill.

25:46.754 --> 25:49.871
Co-Kura:
Sensor readings, they're all
in the danger zone.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.422
Do you read me?

25:51.509 --> 25:52.874
Crichton?

25:52.969 --> 25:54.209
Commander Crichton?!

25:54.303 --> 25:56.464
Do you read me?

25:56.556 --> 25:58.387
Do you read me?!

26:03.438 --> 26:05.269
Co-Kura:
Can you read me?

26:05.815 --> 26:07.271
Crichton?

26:08.317 --> 26:10.899
Get me readings!

26:10.987 --> 26:13.478
Are either of them still alive?

26:13.573 --> 26:16.861
I'm going to enjoy this,
Commander.

26:16.951 --> 26:18.191
Not as much as me.

26:18.286 --> 26:19.867
( beeping )

26:21.122 --> 26:22.282
Grenade!

26:34.302 --> 26:37.294
Co-Kura, we are experiencing
heavy instabilities.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.049
Attempting to recover.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.131
Scorpius:
What is causing this, John?

26:41.225 --> 26:44.968
Flying through wormholes ain't
like dusting crops, farm boy.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.348
It takes a little finesse.

26:53.780 --> 26:57.193
Okay, Co-Kura.
We are stabilizing.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.444
Sensor readings confirm that.

27:06.876 --> 27:08.457
Now you go.

27:25.686 --> 27:29.304
I've never felt this...
connected, John.

27:29.398 --> 27:32.265
You're not goin' all mushy on
me back there, are you?

27:32.360 --> 27:36.194
Co-Kura:
The wormhole appears to be
experiencing wave fluctuations.

27:36.280 --> 27:41.024
l... I strongly recommend that
you fly clear and return
to the Carrier.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.325
Right.

27:50.253 --> 27:52.335
(faint beeps)

27:52.421 --> 27:56.164
Yes, Talyn. I'm here.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.927
(sighs)

28:01.013 --> 28:03.220
No need to be afraid.

28:05.935 --> 28:09.268
Talyn...

28:09.355 --> 28:18.150
the firing mechanism on your
cannon was taken from you
by the Peacekeepers.

28:19.240 --> 28:24.234
The rest have been captured...

28:25.037 --> 28:26.993
and Moya...

28:27.081 --> 28:32.121
Moya will soon be
enslaved, unless...

28:33.421 --> 28:35.457
we do something.

28:37.425 --> 28:39.711
Something radical.

28:41.387 --> 28:45.300
You and l.

28:46.017 --> 28:48.099
Together.

28:52.315 --> 28:54.397
You haven't got your
wormhole legs yet.

28:54.483 --> 28:58.067
Don't worry.
First time is the worst.

28:58.154 --> 29:00.270
Crais:
Scorpius.

29:01.866 --> 29:06.235
lam just making my
final goodbyes.

29:06.329 --> 29:08.160
Where are you, Crais?

29:08.247 --> 29:11.785
lam standing in your heart.

29:11.876 --> 29:14.288
And I am about to squeeze.

29:15.129 --> 29:16.790
Braca.

29:16.881 --> 29:20.965
Find the source of this
transmission and arrest
that fool.

29:21.052 --> 29:25.591
Braca:
It's coming from the hybrid in
the Gamma hanger on level 12.

29:27.058 --> 29:28.798
The hybrid's powering up.

29:38.444 --> 29:43.905
Crais:
You are the most repellent
of creatures, Scorpius.

29:43.991 --> 29:46.277
You weren't born into
Peacekeepers.

29:46.369 --> 29:49.987
You weren't conscripted
against your will.

29:50.081 --> 29:51.662
You chose to be one.

29:51.749 --> 29:54.661
I want the bay doors sealed.

29:54.752 --> 29:58.210
All Prowlers scrambled.

29:58.297 --> 30:02.506
That hybrid must not get away.

30:02.593 --> 30:06.461
The hybrid's building to maximum
power inside the hanger.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.683
ldon't think he's planning
to escape.

30:09.767 --> 30:12.008
Crais:
The last time I left this ship,

30:12.103 --> 30:14.094
my ship,

30:14.188 --> 30:16.099
I did so under a
veil of secrecy.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.101
You forced that situation.

30:18.192 --> 30:20.183
You took away my command.

30:20.277 --> 30:23.610
You stole my life from me.

30:25.992 --> 30:28.449
Well, this time, Scorpius,

30:31.247 --> 30:33.238
I am not leaving quietly.

30:33.332 --> 30:39.328
Somebody find that fool and
get him out of that ship.

30:43.676 --> 30:46.008
(rumbling)

30:55.312 --> 30:59.271
Somebody get that traitor
off that ship!

31:00.609 --> 31:02.145
(growling)

31:02.236 --> 31:04.978
| suggest you hang on
to something.

31:07.992 --> 31:08.697
( growls )

31:08.784 --> 31:10.194
(whimpering)

31:17.543 --> 31:18.498
Talyn.

31:18.586 --> 31:20.542
( beeps )

31:23.132 --> 31:24.588
Starburst.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.264
( loud explosion )

31:36.228 --> 31:38.059
What the frell?

31:42.777 --> 31:45.484
Announcer:
Emergency. Emergency.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.732
(yelling and screaming)

31:49.325 --> 31:51.111
Chiana:
D'Argo!

31:53.621 --> 31:56.203
He's done it. It's going down.

32:08.302 --> 32:12.090
Yes, Moya. I see it.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.346
| see it.

32:28.823 --> 32:29.528
Let us out!

32:29.615 --> 32:31.480
(shrieking)

32:35.371 --> 32:37.077
(shrieking)

32:37.164 --> 32:38.745
Jool!

32:38.833 --> 32:40.744
It's Crichton. He's done it.

32:40.835 --> 32:42.666
He's done it. He's killed it.

32:42.753 --> 32:44.744
Rygel:
Yeah, but he's also killing us.

32:44.839 --> 32:46.545
We're still frelling trapped.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.872
( screaming )

32:47.967 --> 32:50.583
I want out!

33:03.232 --> 33:05.018
Aeryn:
It's time to go!

33:06.443 --> 33:08.354
Clear the area!

33:08.445 --> 33:09.696
Move it!

33:15.870 --> 33:17.110
Move!

33:17.204 --> 33:19.991
Evacuation procedures now!

34:20.559 --> 34:21.594
We have to go.

34:21.685 --> 34:23.596
No, I must save our data.

34:23.687 --> 34:26.804
This ship is dead.

34:26.899 --> 34:29.390
The wormhole experiment
is over, Co-Kura.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.146
It's for the best.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.478
You had something to
do with this.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.608
No!

34:38.369 --> 34:39.950
But you wanted this too.

34:40.037 --> 34:41.152
More than you know.

34:41.247 --> 34:44.580
To stabilize a wormhole.
To tame it, to tame its power.

34:44.667 --> 34:48.376
It would have been the greatest
scientific discovery anyone
could imagine.

34:48.462 --> 34:52.296
It is not just science!

34:52.383 --> 34:55.216
It is neverjust science.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.759
It's a weapon. It kills.

34:57.846 --> 35:01.464
And I would not let the
Peacekeepers have it.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.470
Do you understand me?
-Yes, I understand.

35:05.729 --> 35:08.937
But you still hold the
knowledge in your mind.

35:11.318 --> 35:15.277
Then I'll have to be very,
very careful.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.740
Can you get to an escape pod?

35:21.036 --> 35:22.776
Commander.

35:22.871 --> 35:27.410
Other than you, there's one
receptacle which holds
significant data

35:27.501 --> 35:30.288
pertaining to wormhole research.

35:30.379 --> 35:33.337
If he lives, Scorpius
will find me,

35:33.424 --> 35:36.382
force me to tell him
what I know.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.175
Damn.

35:39.263 --> 35:41.800
What are we going to
do about that?

35:41.890 --> 35:44.552
Only one thing to do.

35:52.526 --> 35:55.609
Co-Kura:
The Aurora Chair will erase all
wormhole knowledge from my mind.

35:55.696 --> 36:01.282
Yeah, but Co-Kura, the chair
won't wipe what I know and
if it could,

36:01.368 --> 36:04.280
I don't know that I could do
what you're doing.

36:04.371 --> 36:05.986
You're a brave man.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.747
D'Argo! Chiana!
-Aeryn!

36:09.835 --> 36:10.950
Aeryn, this way!

36:11.045 --> 36:13.206
Down here! Down here!

36:15.799 --> 36:18.586
We're going to be Boolite goo
realsoon!

36:18.677 --> 36:20.588
It's bent the bars!

36:22.765 --> 36:24.756
Now! Chiana, let's go.

36:31.398 --> 36:32.729
Braca:
Sir!

36:37.446 --> 36:40.404
Attention personnel.
This is Scorpius.

36:43.452 --> 36:47.445
The Command Carrier is
collapsing in on itself.

36:47.539 --> 36:52.875
Priority One Escape Procedures
for the entire ship are
now in effect!

36:56.340 --> 36:57.921
Braca.

36:58.008 --> 36:59.794
Come with me.

37:03.597 --> 37:05.133
Crichton, are you still
with Co-Kura?

37:05.224 --> 37:07.260
Yeah, Aeryn. You okay?

37:07.351 --> 37:10.184
Yes. The others are attending
to business and then we shall
be seeking transport.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.352
Do not wait for me.
I'm gonna get to the module.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.350
I'll meet you back at Moya.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.181
Crichton.

37:16.276 --> 37:19.609
It would have been nice to know
it could have been done.

37:22.199 --> 37:23.564
Yeah.

37:26.036 --> 37:27.947
( screams )

37:37.840 --> 37:39.250
Pilot?

37:40.426 --> 37:41.757
Pilot, can you hear me?

37:41.844 --> 37:43.630
D'Argo, is that you?

37:43.720 --> 37:47.463
This Command Carrier is blowing
to bits and we cannot get
an escape pod off.

37:47.558 --> 37:49.765
I need transportation
out of here now!

37:49.852 --> 37:51.558
What do you want me to do?

37:51.645 --> 37:53.181
Patch me through to my ship.

37:53.272 --> 37:54.762
Doing it now.

37:56.275 --> 37:57.981
Voice activation on.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.399
(gasps )

38:00.988 --> 38:03.400
Weapons and defense
shields activate.

38:04.366 --> 38:06.982
Prepare for rescue retrieval.

38:21.592 --> 38:24.925
Officer Sun, drop your weapon!

38:27.723 --> 38:29.554
You did this, didn't you?

38:29.641 --> 38:31.802
You and your fellow traitors.

38:33.145 --> 38:35.227
There are 50,000 of us.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.599
We gave you enough time.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.476
Most of you will survive.
-Most.

38:38.567 --> 38:40.478
I know that by destroying
this ship

38:40.569 --> 38:43.231
lam saving millions of
lives, Henta.

38:46.450 --> 38:49.112
Too bad you can't save yourself.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.285
(gasping)

39:03.425 --> 39:04.756
(gasps )

39:23.570 --> 39:26.186
(gasps )

39:26.281 --> 39:29.114
D'Argo, Moya's scans are
rising to critical.

39:29.201 --> 39:33.319
If we're not away from here when
the Command Carrier implodes,

39:33.413 --> 39:35.244
it will destroy Moya.

39:35.332 --> 39:38.369
We're on our way, Pilot.
Give us 60 microts.

40:07.447 --> 40:10.439
Looks like our partnership
is over.

40:12.327 --> 40:14.318
John Crichton.

40:15.414 --> 40:17.325
Commander John Crichton.

40:18.667 --> 40:22.159
Generations will know
that name.

40:22.254 --> 40:26.839
Because of you, very soon,

40:26.925 --> 40:29.962
the Scarrans will destroy us.

40:30.053 --> 40:32.214
One evil at a time.

40:32.306 --> 40:34.467
That's the best I can do.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.938
Tell me, Gandhi.

40:48.238 --> 40:50.945
You still going after Earth?

40:51.033 --> 40:53.274
To what purpose?

40:53.368 --> 40:55.359
Vengeance against you?

40:55.454 --> 40:59.447
The only vengeance I cared about
is no longer within my grasp.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.793
While holding two lights,
depress 3-1-7,

41:06.715 --> 41:08.580
then release.

41:09.885 --> 41:14.504
Hold two, press 9-1-1,

41:14.598 --> 41:16.429
and release.

41:27.694 --> 41:29.901
We were close.

41:42.417 --> 41:46.877
If we're gonna get off this
boat, now would be a good time.

41:51.051 --> 41:54.043
I may not be getting off
this ship, John.

42:01.311 --> 42:03.643
Goodbye, Crichton.

42:06.566 --> 42:08.227
Scorpius!

42:18.286 --> 42:20.902
Crichton, the others are
on D'Argo's ship.

42:20.997 --> 42:23.454
I've taken a Prowler and
I'm leaving now.

42:23.542 --> 42:25.248
On my way.

42:29.965 --> 42:31.330
Aeryn.

42:32.509 --> 42:34.374
What?

42:35.846 --> 42:37.882
Fly safe.

43:02.330 --> 43:06.619
We all knew the time would come
when we'd split up.

43:06.710 --> 43:10.453
In the beginning I would never
have even believed it could
take so long.

43:10.547 --> 43:12.629
Don't think I'm going
to miss you.

43:12.716 --> 43:16.004
Any of you. I'm not.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.961
Well, maybe a little bit.

43:21.016 --> 43:23.758
What are you going
to do, Chiana?

43:26.021 --> 43:29.980
I think I might... I might try
and find the Nebari resistance.

43:35.614 --> 43:40.404
Should we manage to reunite
you with your people...

43:43.663 --> 43:46.826
will you be leaving us?

43:56.009 --> 43:59.092
From what I can tell, Pilot,

43:59.179 --> 44:01.921
I won't be the only one
leaving Moya soon.
