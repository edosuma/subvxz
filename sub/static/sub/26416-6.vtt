from California.

for these fugitive Talkers.

dropping off Talkers.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.362
You never saw them?

11:51.798 --> 11:53.103
Not my job, man.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.977
I dunno. They show up
in a truck. That's it.

11:57.020 --> 11:57.717
And these Talkers,

11:59.022 --> 12:00.154
they're eating bizkits
like there's no tomorrow.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.721
So you better hope we get
a shipment soon

12:01.764 --> 12:04.114
or there'll be no tomorrow.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.120

You want to get involved.

12:40.498 --> 12:43.763

but Altura cut off our supply.

12:44.589 --> 12:48.419
I saw the Talkers betting
for them on the casino floor.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.596
Well yeah, I gotta keep
those Talkers fed and happy.

12:51.640 --> 12:55.252

16:21.154 --> 16:22.155
Can you hear me?

16:22.198 --> 16:23.069
It's Lucy.

16:23.547 --> 16:24.287
What?

16:25.419 --> 16:26.246
Lucy.

16:28.291 --> 16:28.857
Lucy!

16:28.900 --> 16:29.771
Murphy!

16:29.814 --> 16:30.163
Lucy!

16:30.206 --> 16:31.164
Murphy!

16:32.948 --> 16:34.167
Don't move!

16:36.560 --> 16:37.692
Addy.

16:41.043 --> 16:44.003
Well of course
you're the Big Red One.

16:55.797 --> 16:59.061
I know, it's been a long road
for all of us.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.411
I sure missed you.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.413
And Lucy too.

17:05.502 --> 17:08.592
Missed you too, Doc.
Missed you too.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.384
Sorry about the gun.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.561
I felt Lucy in you.

17:21.649 --> 17:24.391
I know it doesn't
make any sense,

17:24.434 --> 17:26.349
but I thought it was her.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.526
I thought about taking the shot.

17:30.484 --> 17:33.922
Speaking of which, Z Shine,
please.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.163
Thank you.

17:58.642 --> 17:59.948
To Lucy.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.993
To Lucy.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.089
Hey, you guys...

18:10.132 --> 18:13.527
You bury her somewhere
that I could visit?

18:13.788 --> 18:15.485
Viking funeral.

18:16.573 --> 18:20.186
That's good. That's good.
She'd like that.

18:24.015 --> 18:29.282
I saved something of hers. I
think she'd want you to have it.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.954
You know, I felt her too.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.696
When I was looking for her,

18:52.957 --> 18:55.177
during the day
I'd lose the signal.

18:55.525 --> 18:59.268
But at night,
I'd look up at the stars,

18:59.312 --> 19:01.618
and it's like I could feel her.

19:01.662 --> 19:05.100
You know like maybe
she was thinking about me.

19:06.797 --> 19:10.410
And then, and then one night,

19:11.976 --> 19:15.893
I looked up at the stars
and I felt nothing.

19:16.329 --> 19:19.984
Just the weight of them,
crushing me down.

19:20.855 --> 19:23.336
That's when I knew I was alone.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.774
And I haven't felt anything
since.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.472
She did love you.

19:32.388 --> 19:35.261
But I wasn't there to save her.

19:36.087 --> 19:39.047
But hey, neither were you. So...

19:40.831 --> 19:44.270
You shouldn't drink so much.
You look like shit.

19:44.835 --> 19:45.880
Bite me, Murphy.

19:45.923 --> 19:49.362
Boss
Boss, we have a problem.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.060
All right. I'll take care of it.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.195
Tell the others to keep their
eyes open. Doc, come with me.

19:57.065 --> 20:00.416
Don't listen to him.
You look great.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.057
Stay close.

20:39.412 --> 20:40.500
How'd she get out?

20:40.543 --> 20:41.588
I don't know.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.112
But that means the others
are running around here

20:44.155 --> 20:44.678
somewhere too.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.158
You stay back.
You're food. I'm not.

20:47.202 --> 20:49.422
Oh come on. She looks like
she might still be nice.

20:49.465 --> 20:51.467
Hey, Marjorie. Remember me?

20:51.511 --> 20:54.340
Yeah, Doc.
You look a little lost.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.909
Dante!

20:59.693 --> 21:00.998
She's not nice.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.784
Come on.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.790
Still no sign of him.

21:10.573 --> 21:14.534
Addy,
this is my good friend George.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.884
It's an honor to meet you.

21:18.189 --> 21:21.192
Any friend of the Talkers
is a friend of mine.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.326
I'm not their friend.

21:24.587 --> 21:25.545
No?

21:25.588 --> 21:26.981
Nope!

21:27.024 --> 21:29.375
You've put yourself in
grave danger just to help them.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.900
I didn't even know
about the attack in Altura.

21:32.943 --> 21:36.599
I just had a truck.
There was a Talker family.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.906
They asked me to smuggle them
across the border

21:38.949 --> 21:40.995
because I had a truck.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.564
They had a baby.

21:45.042 --> 21:48.089
Never seen a Talker baby before.

21:49.090 --> 21:52.659
Lucy couldn't stop growing,
and here they had this

21:52.702 --> 21:56.880
little baby that was never gonna
grow a day again in its life.

21:57.141 --> 21:59.927
They were scared.
So I helped them.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.844
I was just glad to have
a mission again. That's all.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.500
I'm sleepy.

22:08.196 --> 22:09.719
Any of those Talkers you helped,

22:09.763 --> 22:12.461
you happen to come across
one named Dante?

22:19.163 --> 22:20.382
Uh,

22:21.601 --> 22:23.342
no.

22:23.777 --> 22:26.736
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.999
No, no, no
I know what you're gonna do.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.349
Shoo.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.743
This is what you're into now?
Huh?

22:33.787 --> 22:36.006
You're gonna get him executed?

22:36.616 --> 22:37.791
Huh.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.011
Where is she?

22:41.316 --> 22:43.710
Rabid Talkers
are not great for business.

22:43.753 --> 22:46.016
Limbo is the one place
where folks can get away

22:46.060 --> 22:48.497
and forget about getting eaten
for a minute.

22:48.976 --> 22:52.283
Hey Murphy, do you think that
dancer really liked me?

22:52.327 --> 22:55.983
It's weird. You know I felt like
she really got me, you know?

22:56.026 --> 22:59.552
Once you go Blend,
Blend to the end.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.500
Go, go, go, go, go!
Stay behind me!

23:34.543 --> 23:36.327
Stay behind me!
Go, go, go, go, go!

23:36.371 --> 23:37.111
In here, Murphy!

23:38.634 --> 23:39.635
Get them inside!

23:41.550 --> 23:42.421
Sorry.

23:46.033 --> 23:46.860
Sorry.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.820
Murphy. Not now, Marjorie.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.302
Murphy, they're friends.
Remember?

23:54.345 --> 23:56.478
Friends don't have friends
for lunch.

23:57.305 --> 23:58.524
Well now what do we do?

23:58.828 --> 24:00.439
We feed them.

24:01.048 --> 24:02.266
Come on.

24:02.310 --> 24:02.963
Sorry, guys.

24:04.051 --> 24:04.921
We're going to need
a lot of bizkits.

24:04.965 --> 24:05.792
Right now Dante is a fugitive.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.228
A trial will clear his name.

24:07.271 --> 24:09.752
We have all seen the kind of
trials that Talkers get.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.928
He's better off
exactly where he is.

24:15.018 --> 24:16.542
Where is that?

24:19.066 --> 24:21.460
Hey, hey, hey. Talk to me.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.768
It's been real, Warren. Bye bye.

Addison?

No, no, no. Wait, wait. Please?

We call it the...

28:01.418 --> 28:03.725
bullets for bizkits program.

28:10.776 --> 28:14.736
Let's say I hold onto this
one more week.

Maybe

28:29.795 --> 28:32.275
I'll just eat them all

28:36.845 --> 28:38.238
You listen to me, Moby Prick.

Hey, hey, hey. Now, now,
what if I win them off you?

28:43.373 --> 28:44.113
Name your game.

28:44.157 --> 28:44.940
What are you doing?

28:44.984 --> 28:46.202
Shut up.

28:48.248 --> 28:52.426
I have the longest winning

28:52.469 --> 28:54.733
I even got Clooney's foot
to giggle.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.735
That's a daily double.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.868
Then what've you got to lose?

29:05.961 --> 29:08.659
Well I do like that hat.

29:19.192 --> 29:20.671
All right, place your bets.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.021
Hope you know what you're doing.

29:28.157 --> 29:30.029

What, now you're being honest.

Go fish.

Well if I keep playing,
I'm bound to win something.

30:00.711 --> 30:01.974

This guy's so lucky,
he shits rabbit's feet.

30:03.976 --> 30:06.456
Why you gotta say that?
You're messing with my mojo.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.719
I do like that jacket.

30:24.605 --> 30:25.780
Come on.

30:29.697 --> 30:30.785
Shit.

30:33.353 --> 30:34.397
Shit.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.757
Eight thousand six hundred
and ten.

30:55.505 --> 30:58.291
Okay, where is he?

31:07.604 --> 31:08.518
Oh.

31:09.128 --> 31:10.607
Dante?

31:14.046 --> 31:15.743
Hey, George.

31:23.142 --> 31:24.883
I can't believe it's you.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.581
You haven't changed at all.

31:27.929 --> 31:31.411
I'd never leave your back,
George. Where's my wife?

31:32.542 --> 31:33.804
Hey.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.328
You can trust George.
I promise you.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.373
But can we trust Altura?

31:37.417 --> 31:39.941
Well, CEO Estes is trying
to keep his people safe.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.595
So is it a good idea
to hand over

31:41.638 --> 31:44.554
the leader of the so-called
Talker resistance to him?

31:44.598 --> 31:47.688
Copy you.
Maybe there's another option.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.995
Where does this
Talker Underground end?

31:50.038 --> 31:51.605
It doesn't.

31:51.648 --> 31:53.433
Some of them want to get out of
Newmerica. But most of them,

31:53.476 --> 31:55.435
they want to stay here.
They want to stay

31:55.478 --> 31:58.481
as human as they can
for as long as they can.

32:01.832 --> 32:04.966
So, heard a lot of rumors
about you, Lieutenant.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.576
I didn't plant that bomb.

32:06.620 --> 32:07.186
I know.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.320
CEO Estes has video proof
it was you.

32:11.364 --> 32:13.061
I don't know anything
about that.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.281
What about the Talkers
you escaped Altura with?

32:15.324 --> 32:16.847
We split up.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.806
But I heard what happened.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.764
Vigilantes on the highway.

32:20.808 --> 32:21.940
They're not gonna stop.

32:23.419 --> 32:24.638
Not as long as they think
the Talkers are rebelling

32:24.681 --> 32:25.813
and that you're behind it.

32:27.075 --> 32:30.035
We fight this. We go back.

32:30.078 --> 32:30.949
We'll go together.

32:30.992 --> 32:31.906
That's crazy.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.735
George always does it
the hard way.

32:34.778 --> 32:37.564
That's what I like about her.

32:38.043 --> 32:39.479
My wife?

32:40.262 --> 32:41.655
Where is she?

32:42.612 --> 32:44.484
Marjorie's here.

32:44.527 --> 32:45.441
She's inside.

32:53.319 --> 32:55.147
I'm down to my last sock.

32:55.756 --> 32:57.540
It's not on my foot.

32:58.846 --> 33:01.240
Oh. Big sock.

33:01.283 --> 33:03.024
I do okay.

33:04.156 --> 33:06.114
I could sure use
that secret ace.

33:07.115 --> 33:09.204
I put it up your sleeve.

33:10.901 --> 33:13.904
Oh great.
I'm gonna lose my only sock.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.299
All right. Listen.

33:17.821 --> 33:20.041
I have a proposition for you.

33:20.085 --> 33:23.871
One last hand. All or nothing.
Winner takes all.

33:24.654 --> 33:26.178
I'm listening.

33:28.397 --> 33:31.357
The deed. Ownership of Limbo.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.923
Murphy, what are you doing?

33:32.967 --> 33:36.362
Look. If he takes those bizkits,
this place is doomed anyway.

33:36.405 --> 33:37.798
I have to try.

33:40.540 --> 33:41.628
Deal me in.

34:05.478 --> 34:08.524
I hear you. Ace of spades.

34:08.568 --> 34:12.050
Ace of hearts. Ace of diamonds.

34:13.051 --> 34:13.660
Check.

34:14.878 --> 34:15.923
Call.

34:16.750 --> 34:20.623
Six of clubs. Five of clubs.

34:28.022 --> 34:29.241
I'll take two.

34:31.286 --> 34:32.374
Just call.

34:32.418 --> 34:33.201
Call.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.389
House wins!

34:56.268 --> 34:59.880
What happens in Limbo,
stays in Limbo!

35:01.055 --> 35:01.708
You cheated!

35:01.751 --> 35:02.361
We won!

35:02.404 --> 35:03.188
You did it!

35:03.231 --> 35:04.363
You did it!

35:09.585 --> 35:10.630
You're my best friend!

35:10.673 --> 35:12.371
I love you, man!

35:14.590 --> 35:15.852
Holy hell.

35:17.289 --> 35:18.551
Give me back those bizkits.

35:18.594 --> 35:19.378
Hold on now.

35:20.466 --> 35:21.902
If there's one thing
I've learned from

35:21.945 --> 35:23.947
feeding uppers to rock stars,
it's the body has limits.

35:24.426 --> 35:26.254
Don't you do it. I mean it.

35:26.298 --> 35:30.128
Don't you put that cookie in
your mouth. Son of a bitch!

35:58.678 --> 36:00.897
I don't feel so good.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.815
Clean up table seven.

36:06.512 --> 36:07.643
Stat.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.891
Make sure these bizkits
get down to the talkers

36:37.934 --> 36:39.022
in the wine cellar.

36:44.898 --> 36:47.161
Do I wanna know?

36:48.858 --> 36:51.252
Looks like I saved Limbo.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.862
Murphy helped. You?

36:52.906 --> 36:55.387
We found
what we were looking for.

37:06.789 --> 37:07.964
Who's in charge here?

37:08.008 --> 37:09.270
Christ. What now?

37:09.531 --> 37:10.619
Can I help you?

37:12.012 --> 37:14.144
Was that really necessary?

37:15.320 --> 37:16.538
Can I help you?

37:16.582 --> 37:18.236
We're searching for one
Lieutenant Dante.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.760
And we have reason to believe
that he is

37:20.803 --> 37:22.979
or has been in the area.

37:23.589 --> 37:27.027
A Talker?
Here? Please.

37:29.551 --> 37:31.858
Isn't that Dante's wife?

37:34.295 --> 37:36.297
How does she keep escaping?

37:39.996 --> 37:41.389
You again.

37:41.433 --> 37:43.261
You know it's funny
how you keep popping up.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.653
Yeah well what's funnier

37:44.697 --> 37:46.829
is we came here for the same
reason you did, Captain.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.005
Okay, so we turned this place
upside down.

37:49.049 --> 37:51.791
And there is no Lieutenant Dante
here.

37:51.834 --> 37:52.705
Dante.

37:52.748 --> 37:53.793
Dante.

38:04.586 --> 38:05.848
Dante.

38:06.196 --> 38:09.417
Altura has no power here.
You can't do this.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.078
You are wanted for questioning

38:18.121 --> 38:19.862
in the whereabouts
of Lieutenant Dante.

38:19.906 --> 38:21.255
Dante.

38:21.821 --> 38:23.126
What's wrong with her?

38:23.388 --> 38:25.825
Isn't it obvious?
She needs bizkits.

38:25.868 --> 38:27.261
Dante.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.618
Look,
if he finds the other Talkers,

38:36.662 --> 38:38.403
he's gonna take them with him.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.013
Make sure they're safe. Go.

38:40.056 --> 38:40.970
Got it.

38:52.025 --> 38:53.548
Come out now

38:53.592 --> 38:57.247
or I will shoot this Talker
deader than she already is.

39:00.033 --> 39:01.643
Say the word.

39:01.687 --> 39:02.427
We'll take them all.

39:02.470 --> 39:04.777
No. George,

39:04.820 --> 39:07.040
you're our hope for the future.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.216
I can't let you risk that.

39:09.259 --> 39:10.130
Not for me.

39:10.173 --> 39:11.697
I never leave a brother behind.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.655
We do this together.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.441
Come on. You're hurting her!

39:17.877 --> 39:19.095
Up here!

39:19.661 --> 39:21.359
We're coming down.
Don't hurt her.

39:21.402 --> 39:22.490
Dante.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.101
Let's go.

39:26.581 --> 39:28.931
See. They're surrendering.
Come on.

39:35.024 --> 39:37.070
They're surrendering. Look.

39:37.592 --> 39:40.247
Lieutenant Dante,
you are under arrest.

39:40.290 --> 39:41.422
Marjorie.

39:41.466 --> 39:42.554
Dante.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.123
Dante.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.393
That was a mistake.

39:56.132 --> 39:57.264
Marjorie,

39:58.396 --> 39:59.919
I love you.

39:59.962 --> 40:03.575
Love... Love...

40:03.618 --> 40:04.924
Yeah, baby.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.667
Now, I'll let you take me.

40:12.801 --> 40:13.672
Captain.

40:13.715 --> 40:16.196
Look, he's surrendering.

40:18.677 --> 40:20.113
We go together.

40:20.679 --> 40:23.986
Just the fugitive.
Those are our orders.

40:24.030 --> 40:26.424
Hey, hey. I understand
you're doing your job.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.817
Let her go.
She's not even a part of this!

40:28.861 --> 40:29.992
Don't you bite me!

40:30.689 --> 40:31.211
Come on. Let her go!

40:31.820 --> 40:33.039
No!

40:33.387 --> 40:34.475
No, no, no, no! No!

40:34.519 --> 40:35.607
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:35.650 --> 40:36.825
Marjorie! No!

40:38.436 --> 40:40.612
Hey, you're no good to Dante
if you're behind bars. Come on.

40:40.655 --> 40:42.875
Marjorie! No!

40:43.528 --> 40:47.575
She was too far gone.
She gave me no choice.

40:57.933 --> 40:59.848
What have they done?

41:01.284 --> 41:03.809
Still think humans
are the good guys?

41:08.553 --> 41:10.859
I need to go after him.

41:11.947 --> 41:14.472
I need to be there at his trial.

41:20.216 --> 41:21.130
Hey.

41:21.174 --> 41:22.958
Hey. How are they doing?

41:23.002 --> 41:25.047
Well, we got all the bizkit bits
we could find.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.875
So the Talkers are calm for now.

41:26.919 --> 41:29.269
Okay, good. Thanks.

41:30.313 --> 41:31.314
Doc!

41:31.750 --> 41:32.968
10K?

41:34.056 --> 41:36.058
Where you been, kid?

41:36.494 --> 41:37.320
Addy?

41:38.017 --> 41:39.279
10K.

41:40.019 --> 41:41.499
What the hell?

41:41.934 --> 41:43.588
Oh, I have news.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.720
Man.

41:49.985 --> 41:52.727
Well, it's safe
to let the Talkers out now.

41:52.771 --> 41:55.164
Just make sure they're fed
first.

41:55.208 --> 41:56.339
Yes, sir.

41:56.601 --> 41:58.211
Those vans are being
loaded up deliberately.

41:58.254 --> 42:00.866
Somebody's shipping in
truckloads of zombie tourists.

42:00.909 --> 42:02.215
So you think it's Altura?

42:02.258 --> 42:03.999
I don't know.
That's where I saw the vans.

42:04.043 --> 42:06.306
But it could be anybody.

42:09.178 --> 42:10.397
Well?

42:11.572 --> 42:13.226
We've got to find more bizkits

42:13.269 --> 42:15.924
before every Talker turns
in Newmerica.

42:16.708 --> 42:20.189
We could always
feed them brains.

42:20.233 --> 42:22.496
I'm just throwing it out there.

42:23.018 --> 42:24.672
Let's get a move on.
