WEBVTT

00:04.275 --> 00:08.109
[woman] OK, you beautiful high
school graduates, hold still.

00:08.109 --> 00:13.514
I'm setting the timer now.
Kenny, man up for Pete's sake.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.717
You're right. You're right.
I don't want to be
teary-eyed in my Lilly's...

00:16.717 --> 00:19.720
[sobbing] ...graduation picture!

00:19.720 --> 00:22.553
Oh, real classy, Dad.

00:22.553 --> 00:25.096
- OK, here we go.
- [timer beeping]

00:25.096 --> 00:27.528
- And...
- [camera clicks]

00:27.528 --> 00:30.201
Well, for heaven's sake!

00:32.133 --> 00:33.634
All right.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.437
- Second time's the charm!
- Wait. Hold on.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.239
[blowing nose]

00:38.239 --> 00:40.211
Dad, Dad,
you're embarrassing me.

00:40.211 --> 00:42.173
And I'm paying
for your college.

00:42.173 --> 00:45.546
I'd like to think that
earns me some emotional space.

00:45.546 --> 00:49.580
- OK, here we go.
- [camera beeping]

00:51.752 --> 00:54.255
Dang flabbit!

00:55.686 --> 00:58.659
OK, I think I've got it now.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.592
- OK. And...
- [beeping]

01:02.363 --> 01:04.135
All right. Here I go.

01:04.135 --> 01:05.636
[beeping]

01:08.099 --> 01:10.070
It's not doing anything.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.273
Can we not do this when
I graduate from college?

01:12.273 --> 01:13.644
You mean if you graduate.

01:13.644 --> 01:17.378
[both mimicking]
You mean if you graduate.

01:17.378 --> 01:20.211
- Shut up!
- Oh, cheese and biscuits!

01:20.211 --> 01:23.854
They can send a man to the moon
but they can't make a camera
with a timer that...

01:23.854 --> 01:28.119
- [camera clicks]
- Oh, well, that just tears it!

01:28.119 --> 01:31.562
Somebody get me
a pad and pencil,
I will sketch the dang picture.

01:31.562 --> 01:34.225
Uh, can you draw me in?
'Cause I gotta go to the john.

01:34.225 --> 01:37.368
- Honey, language.
- Restroom.

01:37.368 --> 01:40.671
I'm just gonna go
guard the door.

01:40.671 --> 01:43.604
I won't be able to do that
when she's...

01:43.604 --> 01:44.875
[sobbing] ...in college.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.610
Darn camera.
This thing is about as useful

01:49.610 --> 01:52.443
as a blow dryer
in a bald man's bathroom.

01:52.443 --> 01:54.685
Just calm down.
Let me take a look at it.

01:54.685 --> 01:58.419
I would just like one
nice picture with my
grandbaby on her graduation.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.651
Well, Mamaw, then maybe
you shouldn't have
bought your camera

02:00.651 --> 02:02.553
at Uncle Bud's
House of Suds Car Wash.

02:02.553 --> 02:05.356
I bought your daddy's
first guitar at Uncle Bud's,

02:05.356 --> 02:09.229
and I'll have you know,
things turned out just fine
for him, thank you very much.

02:09.229 --> 02:12.203
You told me you got it
from Johnny Cash.

02:12.203 --> 02:16.807
Yeah, and I set your pet
goldfish free in the lake.
Grow up!

02:16.807 --> 02:20.611
Now, take the picture
before I lose my happy face!

02:20.611 --> 02:22.873
I don't feel very happy.

02:22.873 --> 02:25.746
One second. Sorry.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.178
- [cell phone ringing]
- It's Kelly Ripa's people

02:27.178 --> 02:28.749
just confirming the interview
at the house on Monday.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.752
Sometime between now
and my death would be perfect.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.525
- Sorry.
- Yo, Stewart.
Don't want to be rude,

02:34.525 --> 02:38.459
- but my sister is a big fan...
- I love you in the front,

02:38.459 --> 02:41.732
- and back!
- She's weird, I know.

02:41.732 --> 02:44.835
- Can we get a picture?
- Yeah, but I just promised...

02:44.835 --> 02:46.797
- Great, over here then.
- OK, then.

02:46.797 --> 02:49.200
You have got to be kidding me.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.772
Geez, Palumbo,
give the girl a little space.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.844
- Since when have you
become so considerate?
- I'm not.

02:53.844 --> 02:55.806
Yo, Isabel, picture time.

02:55.806 --> 02:57.878
My niece, big fan.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.581
And If she asks,
I dumped you, all right?

03:00.581 --> 03:03.284
What?! [groans]

03:03.284 --> 03:05.656
- We were here first!
- Uh...

03:05.656 --> 03:09.290
Yeah? Well, my family
came over here with Cortez!

03:09.290 --> 03:12.263
So technically,
we were here first!

03:12.263 --> 03:17.368
OK, everybody, stop it.
The girl's arms are
unnaturally long as it is.

03:17.368 --> 03:19.430
- Mamaw!
- Well, I blame your daddy,

03:19.430 --> 03:22.533
swinging you around
over his head all the time
when you were a baby.

03:22.533 --> 03:25.205
Now, just everybody back off.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.638
Ma, come on.
I know it's frustrating,

03:27.638 --> 03:30.781
but you gotta understand,
ever since she took
that dang wig off,

03:30.781 --> 03:32.813
things got a little crazy
around here.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.516
But you are gonna
get your picture with Miley.
Don't you worry.

03:35.516 --> 03:38.489
But after us.
We're next in line.

03:38.489 --> 03:41.792
- What line?
- [crowd clamoring]

03:45.656 --> 03:47.828
[Miley] Whoo!

I know you're upset today,

04:49.059 --> 04:51.792
but one of your fake nails
just drew real blood.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.626
Mamaw, it's not Dad's fault
that you didn't
get your picture.

04:55.626 --> 04:57.928
It's Miley's.

04:57.928 --> 05:00.331
It's always Miley's fault.

05:00.331 --> 05:03.474
Well, at least I'm not 20 years
old and still living at home.

05:03.474 --> 05:05.736
- Long-armed freak!
- I'm an international pop star!

05:05.736 --> 05:07.638
I'm dating a super model!

05:07.638 --> 05:11.642
- Almost home, almost home.
- Hush up, all of you.

05:11.642 --> 05:15.916
Jackson is right.
I'm just ticked off over this
whole graduation situation.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.719
People not giving
a mamaw cut'sies?

05:18.719 --> 05:21.752
I will never
understand California.

05:21.752 --> 05:25.726
Ya'll will spend millions
protecting some
endangered stinkbug,

05:25.726 --> 05:29.800
but an elderly woman's
tender feelings? Squish.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.862
When exactly will you
be flying home, Mother?

05:31.862 --> 05:35.636
Look, Mamaw, I know life
is a little more complicated

05:35.636 --> 05:38.569
now that I took off the wig,
but I promise
I'll make it up to you.

05:38.569 --> 05:42.643
Tomorrow at 4:00, you
and me at the Hollywood
Plaza Hotel for...

05:42.643 --> 05:44.645
High tea and finger sandwiches?

05:44.645 --> 05:47.978
- With snooty waiters.
- And funny accents.

05:47.978 --> 05:53.353
[both] Simply scrumptious.
[laughing]

05:53.353 --> 05:55.486
I could be an
international pop star, too.

05:56.487 --> 05:58.689
If I had talent.

05:58.689 --> 06:00.461
And hair extensions.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.463
Yeah, I said it!
Hair extensions!

06:02.463 --> 06:04.965
[both mimicking each other]

06:04.965 --> 06:08.799
Almost home, almost home,
almost home, almost home...

06:14.745 --> 06:18.378
Ah! People lined up
to give me money.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.811
America, I love you.

06:20.811 --> 06:23.584
Wow, business
looks pretty good.

06:23.584 --> 06:27.858
Who'd have thought there'd be
such a market for cheese, tomato
and rat droppings?

06:27.858 --> 06:30.060
[laughs] That was one time!

06:30.060 --> 06:32.062
And you went back for seconds!

06:32.062 --> 06:34.795
That's when I thought they were
little flavor-packed olives.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.927
All right,
things are different now, OK?

06:36.927 --> 06:40.731
I added a new ingredient.
Just a touch of rosemary.

06:40.731 --> 06:44.705
Yeah, I get it. You hired
a hot girl named Rosemary
and she's serving the pizza.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.677
No, I actually added rosemary.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.440
But I hired Bambi!

06:49.440 --> 06:50.981
Say hello, Bambi.

06:53.984 --> 06:58.048
Admit it. She gets the old
taste buds going, doesn't she?

06:58.048 --> 07:02.723
Sorry, dude. Even if I wasn't
dating a gorgeous supermodel,

07:02.723 --> 07:06.026
which I am, I'm just
not that into short hair.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.129
Yeah, right. So you're saying
you wouldn't be dating
Siena if she had short hair?

07:09.129 --> 07:11.832
Wouldn't have
given her a second look.

07:11.832 --> 07:15.966
- Given who a second look?
- You if you had short hair.

07:15.966 --> 07:19.870
- I never said that.
- Would you like me to
play it back for you?

07:19.870 --> 07:22.713
- You recorded that?
- I record everything.

07:22.713 --> 07:25.646
We live in a very
litigious society.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.448
Wait a minute. So you're saying
that you wouldn't even

07:28.448 --> 07:32.583
- be attracted to me
if I had short hair?
- I didn't say that.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.055
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

07:35.055 --> 07:38.529
- I said I wouldn't be into her.
- What's the difference?

07:38.529 --> 07:41.492
- Yeah, what's the difference?
- What's the difference?

07:41.492 --> 07:44.795
[laughs] I'll tell
you the difference.

07:44.795 --> 07:46.737
Right after a
refreshing drink of water.

07:48.939 --> 07:53.674
So you're saying that
we wouldn't even be together
right now if I had short hair?

07:53.674 --> 07:55.676
Why are we even
talking about this?

07:55.676 --> 07:59.580
It's not like you're
gonna cut your hair.
It's beautiful.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.912
It's like that shirt.
You wouldn't just
chop off the sleeves.

08:01.912 --> 08:03.884
- It'd look hideous.
- So now I look horrible?

08:03.884 --> 08:06.687
I said hideous.
There's a difference.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.820
- What's the difference?
- Yeah, what's the difference?

08:09.820 --> 08:11.892
I'll tell you the difference.

08:24.875 --> 08:28.639
♪ La-di-di-da
Oh, yeah ♪

08:29.810 --> 08:32.142
- May I help you?
- Yes.

08:32.142 --> 08:36.587
We have a reservation under
Muffy and Tipper Clydesdale.

08:36.587 --> 08:39.690
Of the Malibu Clydesdales.

08:39.690 --> 08:41.952
Of course.
I have your table ready.

08:41.952 --> 08:43.754
Well, make it a good one.

08:43.754 --> 08:46.226
Ooh, a dollar.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.829
Five more of these
and I can buy some milk.

08:51.261 --> 08:53.664
Look at this, Mamaw, no kids.

08:53.664 --> 08:56.066
Just snooty old people that
couldn't care less who I am.

08:56.066 --> 09:00.911
Ooh, and cucumber sandwiches!
Don't they look divine, Muffy?

09:00.911 --> 09:05.275
- I thought I was Tipper.
- Not a good one.

09:06.917 --> 09:09.620
- Muffy, tea time.
- You're right.

09:09.620 --> 09:13.854
I'm not gonna let
Mr. Snooty-patootey
spoil our good time.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.756
I'm just so happy
we could do this, Mamaw.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.658
Oh, me, too, sugar.

09:17.658 --> 09:21.732
I can't believe
that my last grandbaby
is going off to college.

09:21.732 --> 09:25.896
You know, I still remember
the first time we went
to tea back in Nashville.

09:25.896 --> 09:27.998
You could barely
see over the table.

09:33.644 --> 09:37.207
- This is gross!
- [laughs] It's
an acquired taste.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.610
Why don't you just add a
little bit of sugar, sweetie.

09:44.154 --> 09:48.018
Or the whole bowl.

09:48.018 --> 09:49.790
Lord knows they charge enough.

09:50.761 --> 09:53.093
All right. Now, first we toast.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.325
Pinky.

09:55.325 --> 09:59.830
And when we toast,
[affected accent]
we talk like this.

09:59.830 --> 10:04.004
- Like this?
- [laughs] Like this.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.677
[accent] Like this?

10:06.677 --> 10:09.810
By George,
I think she's got it.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.946
[both] Delightful.

10:15.946 --> 10:17.918
[both chuckling]

10:17.918 --> 10:21.291
Oh! Now, sweetie, tell me
all about this Jesse fella.

10:21.291 --> 10:25.195
Do I need to like him
from the get-go or do
I squeeze him a little?

10:25.195 --> 10:27.998
- Well, just like him. I'll...
- I know.

10:27.998 --> 10:30.160
You will take care
of all the squeezing part.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.734
I'm sorry.
My granddaughter adores you.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.265
Can I bother you
for an autograph?

10:35.265 --> 10:38.709
- Uh, well, I...
- You know,
what she's trying to say

10:38.709 --> 10:42.142
is that she's right in the
middle of some private time
with her grandma.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.676
And I know what you're thinking.
"My goodness, you're kidding.

10:45.676 --> 10:48.949
She's much too young to be
a grandma." But it is true.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.923
Lots of water, healthy diet,
and my Belly Dance Your Way
To Better Buns DVD.

10:52.923 --> 10:57.027
- You oughta try it.
- Well, I never.

10:57.027 --> 11:01.061
- Clearly so. Bye-bye.
- Oh!

11:01.061 --> 11:03.063
Mamaw, it's just one autograph.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.736
Sweetie, it's
like ants at a picnic.

11:05.736 --> 11:08.368
You let one in,
the next thing you know,
you got the whole army

11:08.368 --> 11:12.142
crawling all up
in your barracks.
You know what I'm sayin'.

11:12.142 --> 11:13.974
- Excuse me.
- Ya see?

11:13.974 --> 11:16.977
But my granddaughter's a huge
fan and I hate to bother you...

11:16.977 --> 11:18.979
Well, then bless
your heart. Don't.

11:20.150 --> 11:21.952
Mamaw. What's she's
trying to say

11:21.952 --> 11:24.314
is she's just not in town
very often so we're trying
to have quality time.

11:24.314 --> 11:27.287
- I'm sure you understand.
- Make sure she makes it out
to Katherine.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.320
She likes Katie, but I like
Katherine and she's not here.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.993
- She's not gonna sign.
- She's not gonna sign?

11:32.993 --> 11:36.096
- She's not gonna sign!
- It's not like
I don't want to sign.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.800
- So you want to sign?
- Come on, Mamaw. It's just
a couple of autographs.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.133
A couple?
Miley, look around.

11:43.133 --> 11:47.177
It's not gonna be a couple
of autographs, it's gonna
be the whole dang restaurant.

11:47.177 --> 11:50.010
Yeah, but they've all
got nieces or nephews
or grandkids that love me.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.441
- Like Katie.
- Katherine. She likes Katie...

11:51.441 --> 11:52.983
Not the time!

11:54.144 --> 11:56.316
Mamaw,
you've got to understand

11:56.316 --> 11:58.749
- that the fans
are part of my life.
- I know that.

11:58.749 --> 12:00.150
But I'm a part
of your life, too.

12:00.150 --> 12:03.453
- Of course you are, but...
- I'm just a smaller part.

12:03.453 --> 12:05.495
- Mamaw!
- No.

12:05.495 --> 12:07.998
You've made your choice.

12:12.062 --> 12:13.403
Ooh!

12:13.403 --> 12:15.766
Anyway,
make it out to Katherine.

12:15.766 --> 12:18.869
She likes Katie,
but I like Katherine.
So if you would make it out...

12:18.869 --> 12:21.211
She knows!

12:21.211 --> 12:22.172
She's gonna sign!

12:22.172 --> 12:24.174
[all cheering]

12:28.178 --> 12:30.180
♪ Oh, oh ♪

12:30.180 --> 12:32.322
♪ Hey, yeah ♪

12:32.322 --> 12:34.184
Fine! Stay in your room.

12:34.184 --> 12:35.856
But I think
you're being childish.

12:35.856 --> 12:39.189
[Mamaw] I'm being childish? You
know what I have to say to that?

12:39.189 --> 12:41.491
[Mamaw blows raspberry]

12:43.163 --> 12:46.296
Please tell me that
came from her mouth
and not down south.

12:46.296 --> 12:49.539
Either way, I'm not going
up there and finding out.

12:49.539 --> 12:54.304
Daddy, I don't care what
she says, it's not my fault.

12:54.304 --> 12:55.976
I know.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.378
But she is still your mamaw.
You gotta make this right.

12:58.378 --> 13:02.482
- No, I am not apologizing.
- I'm not asking you to.

13:03.513 --> 13:05.555
OK, I'm asking you to.

13:05.555 --> 13:08.458
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I didn't do anything,

13:08.458 --> 13:11.191
and if anyone should be
saying sorry, it's Mamaw.

13:14.965 --> 13:17.127
What is it with you women?

13:17.127 --> 13:20.370
Why do you always have to be
so emotional and dramatic?

13:21.471 --> 13:23.874
A guy would
never act that way.

13:26.877 --> 13:29.379
I am not gonna
apologize to that woman!

13:29.379 --> 13:32.182
You hear me?! Never!

13:33.543 --> 13:35.315
Then there's my boy.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.919
Son, what's going on?

13:38.919 --> 13:42.853
Siena is furious with me
just because I told her
I like her hair long!

13:42.853 --> 13:45.525
And you did that by telling
her you wouldn't like it short,
didn't you?

13:45.525 --> 13:48.828
- How did you know that?
- Well, because you're a guy,

13:48.828 --> 13:51.501
and when a guy opens his mouth,
stupid comes out.

13:51.501 --> 13:55.535
Dad, I do like her hair long.
So telling her
that I hated short hair

13:55.535 --> 13:57.537
was actually a very
heartfelt compliment.

14:00.010 --> 14:01.611
Kinda.

14:01.611 --> 14:04.614
Son, with women, it's
the "kinda" that kills ya.

14:04.614 --> 14:06.546
[whispers] Kills ya dead.

14:09.479 --> 14:13.223
Your mama gave me this as
a tenth anniversary present.

14:13.223 --> 14:16.156
Look at this.
This was me in my disco days.

14:18.628 --> 14:20.530
- Wow.
- Wow!

14:21.331 --> 14:23.493
Me in my new wave days.

14:23.493 --> 14:26.636
- Wow!
- Oh, my!

14:26.636 --> 14:29.869
And this was the cover

14:29.869 --> 14:33.403
of my never-released
 Robby Ray Does Reggae.

14:35.605 --> 14:37.647
Why?

14:39.549 --> 14:41.511
I'm showing you this because

14:41.511 --> 14:44.184
your mama hated every
one of these haircuts,

14:44.184 --> 14:47.187
but she never told me. Why?

14:47.187 --> 14:50.360
Because she loved me
no matter what was
on top of my head.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.893
Oh, man,
I totally don't deserve Siena.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.997
You guys never deserve us.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.969
You're right.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.673
Wha...! Ow!

15:03.673 --> 15:06.506
Wow! Look at you!

15:06.506 --> 15:10.140
- Absolutely gorgeous!
- No, I am not!

15:10.140 --> 15:13.543
I was so mad at you
that I got my hair cut at
the first place I could find.

15:13.543 --> 15:17.347
- And look what he did to me!
- Hey, it's not that bad.

15:17.347 --> 15:20.290
It makes your cheek bones
stand out and your ears look...

15:21.551 --> 15:22.552
...prominent.

15:24.294 --> 15:26.656
- Right, Lilly?
- Good luck!

15:26.656 --> 15:28.999
- Dad?
- What she said.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.566
Look, Siena, I'm sorry
if I made you do this.

15:36.566 --> 15:39.269
And I know it's
a little late, but...

15:39.269 --> 15:41.711
...I'd love you no matter
what your hair looks like.

15:41.711 --> 15:45.175
Even this hideous mess?

15:49.249 --> 15:51.381
On you,

15:51.381 --> 15:52.552
it's beautiful.

15:56.186 --> 15:58.188
That's all I wanted to hear.

15:58.188 --> 16:00.991
Oh, thank the Lord.

16:00.991 --> 16:03.033
What do you mean,
"Thank the Lord"?

16:05.165 --> 16:06.736
For giving me you.

16:06.736 --> 16:09.399
Aw!

16:09.399 --> 16:14.444
You're so cute
when you're stupid.

16:14.444 --> 16:17.177
I know.
And I'm not even trying.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.650
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh ♪

16:20.650 --> 16:24.584
I can't believe
how fabulous your
house is, Miley.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.716
You should really see
this place, Reeg. It's amazing.

16:26.716 --> 16:28.688
They have a horse outside!

16:28.688 --> 16:31.061
He's so beautiful.
When you brush him, he goes...

16:31.061 --> 16:34.594
[flaps lips loudly]
Just like you! [laughs]

16:34.594 --> 16:38.698
I'm kidding. I don't brush
Regis. He has people for that.

16:41.231 --> 16:45.105
Anyway, this has been quite a
year for you, lots of changes.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.537
Yeah, it has, but,
you know, I'm lucky.

16:47.537 --> 16:51.741
I've had awesome friends
and a really supportive family
that has gotten me through it.

16:51.741 --> 16:56.086
Out of my way. Move it.
Coming through.

16:56.086 --> 16:57.717
Anybody make coffee?

16:57.717 --> 16:59.149
For goodness sakes,
hold it down.

16:59.149 --> 17:00.650
They're trying
to do an interview.

17:00.650 --> 17:02.292
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

17:02.292 --> 17:05.355
You see there? At least
I can say that I'm sorry

17:05.355 --> 17:08.558
when I've done something
wrong, unlike other people.

17:08.558 --> 17:11.800
[laughs] That's my Mamaw.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.104
Well, good morning
to you, Mamaw.

17:14.104 --> 17:16.165
You're live
on Regis and Kelly.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.238
Well, consider yourself lucky.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.411
At least you get to be in
the picture with her, Kelly.

17:21.411 --> 17:24.074
She's not a morning person.

17:24.074 --> 17:25.714
Neither is Regis.

17:25.714 --> 17:29.649
And now he's learned how
to sleep with his eyes open.
It's really creepy.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.822
I kid ya 'cause I love ya!

17:32.822 --> 17:36.656
[grinder buzzing]

17:36.656 --> 17:39.729
Ma, do you have to grind
your beans right now?

17:39.729 --> 17:41.231
Well, I'm so sorry.

17:41.231 --> 17:43.193
Maybe I should just
suck on those beans

17:43.193 --> 17:45.795
and then wash 'em down
with some scalding hot water.

17:45.795 --> 17:48.298
How does that work for ya?

17:50.840 --> 17:52.802
- I'll be right back.
- Uh, but...

17:52.802 --> 17:54.674
You're a pro, Ripa,
rise to the challenge.

17:56.746 --> 18:00.410
OK, well, back to you
in the studio, Reeg!

18:00.410 --> 18:02.552
What do you mean "no"?

18:02.552 --> 18:06.156
Well, I'm sorry, but that
eye thing really is creepy.

18:08.718 --> 18:12.692
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm trying to get her to keep
from making so much noise.

18:12.692 --> 18:16.296
- Not you, Dad. You!
- What am I doing?

18:16.296 --> 18:19.599
I'm just making myself
a lovely cup of instant coffee

18:19.599 --> 18:22.372
because I didn't get
any tea yesterday.

18:22.372 --> 18:24.374
Come on, Mamaw.

18:24.374 --> 18:27.207
The tea thing wasn't my fault.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.339
And the graduation picture
wasn't my fault.

18:29.339 --> 18:31.641
It's just my life now.
Please cut me some slack.

18:31.641 --> 18:34.814
That's exactly what your daddy
said when his career took off.

18:34.814 --> 18:38.348
And between the concerts
and the videos and the tours,

18:38.348 --> 18:41.351
I saw him for all of three hours
in the next three years.

18:41.351 --> 18:44.524
Come on, Ma,
you're exaggerating.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.827
Mother's Day, 1994.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.300
We celebrated
in an airport cafe

18:50.300 --> 18:52.662
because you were switching
flights in Nashville.

18:52.662 --> 18:54.864
And the only reason
that I got three hours

18:54.864 --> 18:59.169
was because [sobbing]
there was fog in Boston.

18:59.169 --> 19:03.213
- Is that true, Daddy?
- Well, Mile,
you gotta understand,

19:03.213 --> 19:07.717
when I went number one
with Dr. Love Will See You Now,
 I was huge.

19:09.219 --> 19:13.253
So you will have to forgive me
if cutting slack is hard for me.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.385
But I do not want to spend
another Mother's Day

19:15.385 --> 19:19.389
in an airport cafe
eating chewy meatloaf
and lumpy mashed potatoes.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.796
Uh, so Miley... [laughs]

19:26.796 --> 19:31.841
You ready to come back to our
live national interview? Please?

19:33.943 --> 19:35.375
Right after this.

19:37.447 --> 19:39.178
OK...

19:41.551 --> 19:44.414
So, Reeg, is it time
for that cooking segment yet?

19:45.915 --> 19:47.617
[sobbing] Come on!

19:54.324 --> 19:58.328
Fine way to treat
good furniture.

19:58.328 --> 20:01.831
- Mamaw?
- I give you people a perfectly
lovely housewarming present,

20:01.831 --> 20:05.335
and what do you do?
You dump it outdoors.

20:05.335 --> 20:08.678
It's outdoor furniture.

20:08.678 --> 20:11.941
You always have
to be right, don't you?

20:11.941 --> 20:13.983
Listen, Mamaw, I...

20:16.215 --> 20:18.718
I didn't know
about Mother's Day.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.552
But even if I did, I'm not
sure that there's anything
I could've done differently.

20:22.552 --> 20:25.555
I mean, I wanna be
nice and respectful

20:25.555 --> 20:26.856
to the people
that come up to me.

20:26.856 --> 20:28.558
Of course you do.

20:28.558 --> 20:31.831
Us Stewarts raise our
kids right, dang flabbit.

20:34.604 --> 20:36.406
You know I love you, right?

20:36.406 --> 20:37.907
I know that.

20:37.907 --> 20:41.240
It's just that before
you let the secret out,

20:41.240 --> 20:44.744
you could take that wig off and
me and my Miley could go off

20:44.744 --> 20:47.847
and do what we wanted
and no one would bother us.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.950
And I'm just afraid we're
never gonna have that again.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.883
[sighs] Well, maybe we won't.

20:53.883 --> 20:55.985
Maybe we won't?

20:55.985 --> 21:01.931
What kind of a "heartfelt,
feel-good leadin' to a hug"
kind of moment is that?

21:01.931 --> 21:05.995
Mamaw, you didn't
let me finish.

21:05.995 --> 21:10.670
Listen. Maybe from now on,

21:10.670 --> 21:13.503
our private time
is just gonna have to be

21:13.503 --> 21:17.577
a little more private.
But it's still our time.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.910
And it'll always mean as much
to me as it does to you.

21:20.910 --> 21:23.553
That's the moment
I'm talking about.

21:27.957 --> 21:29.919
Hey.

21:32.061 --> 21:33.993
You got room in that hug
for a guilty son?

21:33.993 --> 21:36.896
Get on in here, "Dr. Love".

21:39.929 --> 21:41.931
Oh, my gosh, Kelly!

21:44.934 --> 21:49.339
Seventy-four, 75, 76, 77!

21:49.339 --> 21:50.940
- Uh, Kelly?
- Not now!

21:50.940 --> 21:54.083
I'm going for my personal best!

21:54.083 --> 21:57.547
Like to see the girls
on The View try this one.

22:02.592 --> 22:05.395

We're gonna get this ♪

22:05.395 --> 22:07.627

22:11.601 --> 22:13.663
- Whatcha doin'?
- I never did get that

22:13.663 --> 22:17.106
graduation picture with you.
So I'm about to fix that now.

22:17.106 --> 22:21.641
This is a little Photoshop,
Mamaw style.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.513
Huh. Artsy.

22:23.513 --> 22:25.975
But now Lilly's dad's
not in the picture.

22:25.975 --> 22:29.619
Oh, like I need that
crybaby on my mantle.

22:29.619 --> 22:32.452
- Now, this is a keeper.
- [laughs]
