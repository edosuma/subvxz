Deven was following
someone that he did know.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.210
They then, at some point,

07:08.562 --> 07:10.262
- There are people out here.
- Okay.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.130
- Um, just not
what I'm looking for,

07:12.199 --> 07:14.132
<i> not like James.</i>

07:14.201 --> 07:16.435
- So let's go back
to the beginning.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.470
You get this random message.
You start chatting.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.605
Do you still have
his dating profiles?

07:20.674 --> 07:22.340
- No.
- He deleted?

07:22.409 --> 07:24.843
- It's normal for somebody
to delete a profile

07:24.912 --> 07:26.445
after finding somebody.

07:26.513 --> 07:29.247
- Have you asked,
is there a particular reason

07:29.316 --> 07:31.416
why James hasn't FaceTimed?

07:31.485 --> 07:32.918
- I haven't asked why.

07:32.986 --> 07:33.952
I'm not trying
to scare him away.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.620
- Okay.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.757
- Every time I bring it up,
it's just a defense mechanism.

07:38.826 --> 07:42.060
- How serious has
the communication become?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.428
- Is he close with his family?

07:43.497 --> 07:45.197
- We've briefly
talked about it,

07:45.265 --> 07:48.099
like the reason he doesn't
live in Detroit anymore.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.468
- Wait, he's from Detroit?

07:49.536 --> 07:51.002
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.504
- He has a 313 number.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.639
- Whoa, have you guys
talked about Detroit?

07:54.708 --> 07:56.408
Did you say, like, "Where'd you
go to high school?"

07:56.477 --> 07:58.043
<i> - Yeah, he told me where</i>
<i> he went to high school.</i>

07:58.111 --> 07:59.778
<i> It was right by my house.</i>

07:59.847 --> 08:01.680
- Whoa.
- So wait a second.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.115
So do y'all know any of the
same people from the same town?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.151
- No, I've looked
on his profile.

08:06.220 --> 08:09.154
We only have one person
in common, Juan.

08:09.223 --> 08:10.355
He used to work
at the airport with me.

08:10.424 --> 08:12.057
- In Detroit.
- Correct, yes.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.593
- Were you friends with him?
- We weren't really close,

08:14.661 --> 08:17.796
um, but I knew that
he had a crush on me,

08:17.865 --> 08:19.965
something like that.
- Oh, man, hold up.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.433
You see, this is
all information.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.368
- Well, this is why we're here.
- This is great.

08:23.437 --> 08:25.203
- But from what you can tell,
has he left Detroit?

08:25.272 --> 08:26.705
Has he moved to California?

08:26.773 --> 08:27.873
- Not that I know of.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.274
- So that could just be
a coincidence.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.675
- That could just be
a coincidence.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.210
- All right, can we see
what James looks like?

08:32.279 --> 08:34.646
All right, so here's James.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.249
So this guy, obviously,
yes, very handsome.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.951
- The next one, don't--wait--
I'ma warn you.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.520
- All right, ready for this?
- Yeah.

08:41.588 --> 08:44.089
- Whoa!
- That man doing?

08:44.157 --> 08:45.557
- [laughs]

08:45.626 --> 08:46.758
- So you think that's him?
- Hold up, man.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.026
Come on, now.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.261
- And you're pretty confident
that's him?

08:49.329 --> 08:50.629
- I think that's him.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.430
- Now, obviously,
the facial hair matches.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.132
You can only really see
a little bit of his profile,

08:54.201 --> 08:55.267
but I do agree.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.668
I do think that looks like him.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.537
Can we see that Instagram
account you found?

08:58.605 --> 09:00.105
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.941
His Instagram is J-A-Y,
oh, and his Facebook.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.010
So he's only told you
his name is James.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.912
- Right.
- So he follows you.

09:06.980 --> 09:07.979
You guys follow each other.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.381
- Y'all follow each other.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.582
You're saying good night.
- That's crazy.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.883
- This might be
a real person.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.319
- But at the same time,
on his Facebook,

09:14.388 --> 09:17.055
it says that he lives
in Buffalo, New York.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.523
- Right, which is weird.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.258
Can we see some of the messages
you guys sent?

09:20.327 --> 09:22.427
- Okay.
- Holy moly.

09:22.496 --> 09:24.129
All that's
just from yesterday?

09:24.197 --> 09:26.631
This is like a month
of conversation with my wife...

09:26.700 --> 09:27.666
- [laughs]

09:27.734 --> 09:29.034
- In one day.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.735
Oh, wait a second.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.737
You said, "Where do you see us
in about two to four years?"

09:32.806 --> 09:36.141
"I see us in two years happy
and hopeful with a dog

09:36.209 --> 09:38.743
and married, trying to start
a family with me."

09:38.812 --> 09:40.679
- Drop the mic.
They talking about family?

09:40.747 --> 09:41.746
- Wow!

09:41.815 --> 09:43.448
- Y'all talking
about love, man.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.317
- You're on the doorstep
of what could be

09:45.385 --> 09:47.852
a very meaningful,
serious relationship.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.523
- I just need your help
to knock on the door.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.191
- All right,
so send us everything.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.759
We'll do some research.
- Yeah.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.761
- Tomorrow morning,
we'll see what we can find.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.330
- All right.
- All right, brah.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.965
Take it easy.
- Thank you.

10:00.033 --> 10:03.602
<i> [tense music]</i>

10:03.670 --> 10:05.403
<i> - If you told me the situation</i>
<i> and you showed me</i>

10:05.472 --> 10:08.506
<i> the Instagram page, I would</i>
<i> think everything was legit.</i>

10:08.575 --> 10:10.175
But the whole not
talking on the phone

10:10.243 --> 10:13.812
plus the never video-chatting
means something is up.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.086
<i> - Right, way more complicated</i>
<i> than I initially thought.</i>

10:23.690 --> 10:25.590
eat music]

10:25.659 --> 10:28.126
- All right, let's get started
with the task at hand.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.761
- All right.
- We've got Deven,

10:29.830 --> 10:32.731
<i> 27-year-old guy,</i>
<i> and he's super low-key</i>

10:32.799 --> 10:34.733
and doesn't like to broadcast
that he's gay.

10:34.801 --> 10:38.303
Happens to get this message
from James on this dating app

10:38.372 --> 10:40.438
<i> and very quickly</i>
<i> becomes infatuated.</i>

10:40.507 --> 10:43.642
- There are conversations
about living with each other,

10:43.710 --> 10:45.276
<i>moving, getting a dog.</i>

10:45.345 --> 10:47.212
- Yeah.
- This is some heavy stuff.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.415
- Another thing that makes
this story particularly unusual

10:50.484 --> 10:53.318
<i> is that Deven and James,</i>
<i> prior to the dating profile,</i>

10:53.387 --> 10:56.021
<i> followed each other</i>
<i> on Instagram.</i>

10:56.089 --> 10:58.490
Well, if you care to join me...
- Let's do it.

10:58.558 --> 11:01.526
- We can head on over
to the investigation station.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.928
All right, we got
an email from Deven.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.664
James' phone number,
so we have that.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.399
It's 313,
which is a Michigan number.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.769
"I don't know his last name,
but he lives in Barstow.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.504
"The profile that's
following me on Instagram

11:12.572 --> 11:14.205
"is Jay Punktualiety.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.507
"When I searched
that name on Facebook,

11:15.575 --> 11:17.075
"his profile popped up.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.910
"That's when I noticed the
mutual friend we have, Juan.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.512
"Here is his Facebook page.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.614
"He and I used to work together
at the airport in Michigan.

11:22.683 --> 11:25.750
"James has sent me
two pictures of his face,

11:25.819 --> 11:27.819
"and I've attached them
along with the nude picture

11:27.888 --> 11:30.021
you requested
but not the video."

11:30.090 --> 11:31.389
Sorry.
- Yeah, appreciate you.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.458
- "If Rashad feels like
he needs to see it,

11:33.527 --> 11:35.093
let me know and I'll send it."

11:35.162 --> 11:37.295
[laughs]
- Oh, we good, bro.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.730
I told ya, we Gucci.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.365
- All right, so where
do you want to start?

11:40.434 --> 11:43.334
- I'm interested in looking
at the Jay Instagram.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.703
- Okay, yeah.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.705
So here's the Jay Instagram
that Deven follows,

11:46.773 --> 11:48.940
2,000 followers.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.209
Here's the pictures
that we saw already.

11:51.278 --> 11:55.613
Oh, here's his Facebook,
also with the Jay Punktualiety.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.248
Lives in Buffalo,
from Buffalo,

11:57.317 --> 11:59.551
so maybe he's from there.
Maybe he just visits.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.019
Wait a second,
what's this?

12:01.088 --> 12:02.654
This was from August.

12:02.723 --> 12:06.291
"I lost my phone this morning
and my Facebook was hacked,

12:06.359 --> 12:10.261
"so I'm sorry whoever seen
my nudes and got inboxed.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.297
If you know me,
I'm far from like that."

12:12.365 --> 12:15.133
- Okay, I mean, that's
interesting, though, so...

12:15.202 --> 12:17.869
- That's, like,
around the time

12:17.938 --> 12:19.738
that Deven and James
started talking.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.239
- Yeah, three months ago.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.374
- That was when
Jay's Facebook was hacked.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.843
Someone got his phone.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.277
- Maybe somebody's
using his identity.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.913
Somebody got into
his information.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.149
Somebody took his nudes.
- Right.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.585
- Put his nudes out somewhere.
- Right.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.120
Oh, here's some replies.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.722
Anthony said, "Someone's
on your page exposing you."

12:37.791 --> 12:40.358
In reply, LeeLee said,
"This his cousin.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.194
His page got hacked.
Somebody got his phone."

12:43.263 --> 12:45.396
- She's his cousin,
so we should talk to her.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.966
- Yeah, "Hey, LeeLee, hope
you're having a nice weekend.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.567
"This is Nev from 'Catfish.'

12:49.636 --> 12:51.336
"I am working on an episode now
that involves your friend

12:51.404 --> 12:53.905
"Jay Punktualiety, would love
to ask you a couple questions.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.073
Please give me a call."

12:55.142 --> 12:56.608
Great, that's a good place
to start.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.777
All right, let's go to friends,
see if we can find Juan.

12:58.845 --> 13:00.945
- Juan is the guy
he used to work with.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.947
- Right, who he said
has a crush on him.

13:03.016 --> 13:06.618
There he is.
He lives in Detroit, Michigan.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.386
He still works at the airport.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.355
Everything else is private.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.690
Okay, we got
a phone number we can search.

13:12.759 --> 13:16.394
Let's see what comes up when
we search the phone number.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.029
No name associated.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.665
It does say it's a landline,
though,

13:20.734 --> 13:22.967
which often means
that it's a text app,

13:23.036 --> 13:26.070
which means the person
could be in Michigan

13:26.139 --> 13:27.438
or could be anywhere

13:27.507 --> 13:28.807
and have just selected
a Michigan area code...

13:28.875 --> 13:30.341
- Right.
- Which is weird,

13:30.410 --> 13:32.076
'cause if you're going
to catfish someone

13:32.145 --> 13:33.945
and say you're from California,
wouldn't you then think,

13:34.014 --> 13:35.680
"Why don't I make
a California phone number?"

13:35.749 --> 13:37.115
Like, doesn't make
a lot of sense.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.117
- Nah.
- But okay.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.418
[cell phone rings]

13:40.487 --> 13:41.653
Oh, what?

13:41.721 --> 13:44.455
We got a phone call from
Plandome Manor, New York.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.590
- What's up, bro?
- Hello?

13:51.531 --> 13:52.997
- Yeah.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.967
- Okay, hey, this is Nev
from the show "Catfish."

13:56.036 --> 13:58.469
I'm with Rashad, who's
my cohost on this episode.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.938
- What's happening?

14:00.006 --> 14:01.739
- And we messaged LeeLee
because we're doing an episode

14:01.808 --> 14:03.708
and we're trying
to just talk to someone

14:03.777 --> 14:07.879
who knows Jay or James.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.582
- That's you.
He's Jay.

14:10.650 --> 14:11.983
This is the guy.
- Oh, okay.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.618
- So great,
you saved us some time.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.553
- Yeah, hey, Jay money,
what's up, bro?

14:15.622 --> 14:17.088
We been looking for you.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.224
- Wait, so I want to ask you
before we say anything,

14:19.292 --> 14:21.759
do you have any idea why
we would be trying

14:21.828 --> 14:24.596
to get in touch with you?

14:24.664 --> 14:26.865
- Have no idea, noted.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.867
- So can we FaceTime?

14:28.935 --> 14:32.036
Yo!
- What up, bro?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.006
- It's you.
- It's definitely you.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.975
What's up, man?
Rashad.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.810
- Okay, so we got
some questions.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.345
Well, your name is James?

14:41.848 --> 14:43.448
- So your real name
is Jarris.

14:43.516 --> 14:44.649
You just go by Jay.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.385
Okay, and where do you live?

14:47.454 --> 14:50.455
- Okay, according
to Instagram,

14:50.523 --> 14:57.662
you follow a guy from Phoenix
named Deven.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.265
- Okay, you don't
know that guy.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.766
- So just random connection.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.134
<i> - I guess.</i>

15:03.203 --> 15:05.003
- So you got hacked,
though, right,

15:05.071 --> 15:07.205
at some point?

15:07.274 --> 15:10.541
Okay, and some information
got leaked out.

15:10.610 --> 15:14.746
- So you're aware that
that photo is out there?

15:14.814 --> 15:15.914
- All right.

15:15.982 --> 15:16.981
- So, basically,
what it looks like,

15:17.050 --> 15:19.217
someone made a profile of you,

15:19.286 --> 15:22.987
found Deven, and then
told them they were you

15:23.056 --> 15:26.291
and sent him
a nude photo of you.

15:26.359 --> 15:30.561
What would be great is, as sad
as it's gonna be for Deven,

15:30.630 --> 15:31.729
I think it would be good

15:31.798 --> 15:33.631
for him to see you
in a video saying,

15:33.700 --> 15:35.733
"We are not texting
and talking every day."

15:45.412 --> 15:48.079
- Thank you for that.
- Appreciate it.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.580
- Is there any other
information you could give us

15:49.649 --> 15:51.316
that would be helpful?

15:51.384 --> 15:54.085
- Yes, there's a mutual friend
that y'all have, Juan [bleep].

15:58.525 --> 16:00.325
- Oh, really?

16:04.597 --> 16:06.397
- Yeah, I see.
- Interesting, okay.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.567
I think you've answered all
the questions you can for us,

16:09.636 --> 16:11.602
which is very helpful.
- Appreciate it, man.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.071
Appreciate it.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.238
- All right, man,
have a good one.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.107
- Good to meet you, Jarris.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.575
- Later.
- All right, bro.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.876
- Boom.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.278
- That just got
interesting, man.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.246
Somebody's pretending
to be this guy.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.316
- We know that Juan
is aware of Jarris

16:25.385 --> 16:27.151
and could have
found his nudes

16:27.220 --> 16:28.853
and been like,
"Ooh, this guy's cute.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.688
I'll use him
to talk to Deven."

16:30.757 --> 16:32.824
I don't want to necessarily
reach out to Juan yet

16:32.892 --> 16:34.726
because if it is him--

16:34.794 --> 16:36.494
- Scare him off.
- Right.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.296
- Definitely.
- But at the same time,

16:38.365 --> 16:40.398
if it's not Juan,
then it's probably

16:40.467 --> 16:43.468
just some totally
random unknown.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.636
- But James,
who is the catfish,

16:45.705 --> 16:49.240
is still asking to meet up
face to face,

16:49.309 --> 16:50.808
which is unusual...
- Right, yeah.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.678
- Because James knows
when they meet face to face,

16:53.747 --> 16:56.247
it's not gonna be the same
person in these pictures.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.250
- If Deven had gone,
what would have happened?

16:59.319 --> 17:01.519
- That's scary.
A lot of things can happen.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.388

17:07.027 --> 17:08.159

17:08.228 --> 17:09.427

17:09.496 --> 17:10.962
- We've got a lot
to talk about.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.997
We wanted to find out
if we could come meet up.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.534
- All right, text me
the address

17:16.603 --> 17:17.802
and we'll meet you
over there.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.637

- What's going on?

17:19.706 --> 17:21.472
- Oh!

17:21.541 --> 17:22.673
What's up?
- How's it going?

17:22.742 --> 17:24.008
- Good, how's it going, man?

17:24.077 --> 17:26.544
- All right, guys,
let's have a seat.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.780
Anything to report
since we last spoke?

17:28.848 --> 17:31.749
- Nothing to report,
but trying to get through this

17:31.818 --> 17:33.484
has been, like,
really stressful.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.786
- You just look, like, drained.

17:34.854 --> 17:35.987
- A lot on your mind.
- Right.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.355
- A lot on my mind.
- Yeah.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.689
- Just, the dishonesty
is just--

17:38.758 --> 17:39.991
it's just kicking my ass
right now.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.859
- Why don't we show you
what we found.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.461
- Okay.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.929
- Now, we started
with your email,

17:44.998 --> 17:47.165
and we wanted to go
check out his profiles.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.266
- Mm-hmm.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.001
- So we looked
through the posts,

17:50.070 --> 17:51.636
and then this was interesting
'cause he was talking about

17:51.704 --> 17:53.271
how someone hacked
his Facebook account

17:53.339 --> 17:55.973
and started sending around
his nudes.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.242
It's a little unclear
what exactly happened,

17:58.311 --> 18:01.079
but this girl LeeLee says,
"Oh, this is his cousin.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.481
His page got hacked."

18:03.550 --> 18:05.850
So we messaged her,
and she got back to us.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.452
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.088
So LeeLee got our message
about Jay...

18:10.156 --> 18:11.222
- All right.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.725
- And had her cousin call us.
- Mm-hmm.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.861
- And her cousin's name
was Jarris.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.263
- Jarris.
- But he goes by Jay.

18:19.332 --> 18:23.234
And we made a little clip of
our conversation to show you.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.341

19:37.410 --> 19:40.645
We also looked up

Detroit, Michigan.

we asked Jarris

19:50.657 --> 19:52.256
if he knew Juan.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.825
- He said he messaged him

19:56.763 --> 19:57.828

- Right.

19:57.897 --> 19:58.963
It's definitely
suspicious.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.499
Juan has communicated
with Jarris.

20:01.568 --> 20:02.833
- Just out of curiosity,

20:02.902 --> 20:05.536
when is the last time
you talked with Juan?

20:05.605 --> 20:08.573
- Since the last time
I've actually been in Michigan.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.241
- But it was very casual.
- Right.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.709
- You've never, like,
hung out with him?

20:11.778 --> 20:13.444
- No.

20:13.513 --> 20:14.712
- Do you think he could have
been, like, hurt by that or...

20:14.781 --> 20:15.813
- You know he likes you.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.381
- Yeah, I don't know.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.684
- So that kind of led us to be
where we are now.

20:19.752 --> 20:23.988
- I'm thinking if we tell James
we know that he's been lying,

20:24.057 --> 20:25.990
there's always
a chance he could...

20:26.059 --> 20:27.692
- Disappear.
- Right.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.060
So that got me thinking.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.729
I don't like
to surprise people,

20:31.798 --> 20:33.898
but since he invited you,

20:33.967 --> 20:36.000
what if you just followed up
and were like,

20:36.069 --> 20:39.370
"Hey, I could
fly out and meet you"?

20:39.439 --> 20:41.839
Maybe he would say yes.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.841
- I'm not usually
that type of person

20:43.910 --> 20:45.576

20:45.645 --> 20:47.445

21:20.847 --> 21:23.514

21:27.687 --> 21:28.986

21:29.055 --> 21:31.489
- Somebody that used
to live in Michigan,

21:31.557 --> 21:32.890
and they moved to Las Vegas.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.258

Not really an ex,

fooling around with in Detroit.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.900
- Yes.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.068

the impression when you moved

21:47.307 --> 21:48.673

21:48.741 --> 21:49.940

that it could lead up
to something like this.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.580

person that you know in Vegas

21:56.649 --> 21:58.015

33:59.905 --> 34:01.138
- All right, well, look,

34:01.206 --> 34:03.907
you deserve some kind
of clarity, I think.

34:03.976 --> 34:05.442
<i> - What is it?</i>

34:05.511 --> 34:07.978
Is it his personality?

34:08.047 --> 34:09.212
Is it the way he looks?

34:09.281 --> 34:11.648
He kind of needs
a closure as well.

34:11.717 --> 34:12.916
- It wasn't
his personality.

34:12.985 --> 34:14.184
That wasn't the problem.

34:14.253 --> 34:17.687
I'm just not--
just not attracted to him.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.523
What else do you
want me to say?

34:19.591 --> 34:21.992
- Right, I'm just thinking,
"I'm not attracted to you,

34:22.061 --> 34:24.961
but I did things that I do
with people I'm attracted to."

34:25.030 --> 34:26.296
- Okay.
- So that could be confusing.

34:26.365 --> 34:27.631
- Can be attracted to a hooker,

34:27.699 --> 34:29.232
but that don't mean
you love her.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.139
<i> - Sha'Quan needs to know what</i>
<i> you feel and what you want.</i>

34:36.208 --> 34:38.442
- I know what exactly
what I want to say.

[cell phone swoops]

34:41.413 --> 34:44.014
[cell phone swoops]

34:48.287 --> 34:51.488
- Hello, hi.
- Hi, we're here for Sha'Quan.

34:51.557 --> 34:52.923
- Okay, he's in here.

34:52.991 --> 34:54.324
Just go ahead.
- What's your name?

34:54.393 --> 34:55.525
- Tiara.
- Tiara.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.927
It's nice to meet you.

34:56.995 --> 34:58.161
- He's in here,
if you guys want to come in.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.330
- All right.
Hey, buddy.

35:00.399 --> 35:03.100
- Hi.
- Whew.

35:03.168 --> 35:07.537
So I guess do you know
what's been going on

35:07.606 --> 35:09.306
this whole time?
- Yeah, kind of do.

35:09.374 --> 35:13.343
Not the whole time, but when
he began to tell me about it,

35:13.412 --> 35:16.246
I was--you know, I was like,
"No, that's not cool."

35:17.716 --> 35:20.050
- It wasn't supposed
to go this far.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.292
- You wanted me to move to LA.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.795
You wanted me to come visit you
in Las Vegas.

35:31.864 --> 35:34.798
Why?
- I really like talking to you.

35:34.867 --> 35:37.267
But then you, like, cut me off
or just disappeared.

35:38.704 --> 35:42.472
- Do you feel that because
you wasn't getting a response

35:42.541 --> 35:43.840
in a timely manner

35:43.909 --> 35:47.110
that it deserves
to then have a fake account?

35:51.884 --> 35:53.517
- But what he did,
he did the same thing.

35:53.585 --> 35:57.254
Not catfishing,
but he was ghosting you.

35:57.322 --> 35:58.855
He was messaging you.

35:58.924 --> 36:01.057
He'd get what he want
and then disappear.

36:01.126 --> 36:04.261
And the way he's saying it now
is as if that was okay too.

36:04.329 --> 36:05.829
That wasn't cool either.

36:05.898 --> 36:08.832
- I've told him that
I am not comfortable

36:08.901 --> 36:11.268
with being in a relationship,

36:11.336 --> 36:13.670
and we kept meeting,

36:13.739 --> 36:15.338
and I assumed
that he was okay with that.

36:16.909 --> 36:18.909
- A while ago.
- Text me what?

36:18.977 --> 36:21.411
- Meeting you like that
was never--it was...

36:22.347 --> 36:24.614
- But then did you
see him again after that?

36:24.683 --> 36:25.916
- Yeah.

36:25.984 --> 36:29.119
- So he feels
he communicated to you

36:29.188 --> 36:31.154
that he doesn't want to see you
if it's gonna be casual,

36:31.223 --> 36:33.990
and then you
wanting to see him again

36:34.059 --> 36:37.627
suggested that you were
in something more than that.

36:38.197 --> 36:39.496
- Sure.

36:39.932 --> 36:43.033
- I don't know,
he was more of somebody

36:43.101 --> 36:45.235
that I could actually
see myself with.

36:45.304 --> 36:48.038
<i> [poignant music]</i>

36:48.106 --> 36:50.173
- But it's just mostly
the looks, is it?

36:50.242 --> 36:52.309
- I'm just not attracted
to Sha'Quan

36:52.377 --> 36:54.177
in the relationship
type of way.

36:54.246 --> 36:55.946
- Just in the hooking up
type of way.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.948
Like, that's where
the confusion is coming from.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.382
'cause it's, like,
you're not attracted to him.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.918
He's not your type
or whatever it is, right?

37:01.987 --> 37:04.921
But he's enough for you
to come hook up.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.190
- Is that what you
want me to tell her?

37:07.259 --> 37:08.625
- Tell her what?

37:08.694 --> 37:09.993
- Is that what
you want me to say?

37:10.062 --> 37:12.362
Like, yeah, that's all
it was for me.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.631
- Was it?

37:14.700 --> 37:16.399
- How long have
we known each other?

37:16.468 --> 37:18.335
- Since I was 18.

37:18.403 --> 37:21.037
- We've been back and forth
all this time.

37:21.106 --> 37:22.372
You're 23.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.241
We've done the same thing.

37:24.309 --> 37:25.909
How could you not
get that impression

37:25.978 --> 37:28.678
that that's the only thing
that I would like?

37:28.747 --> 37:29.913
- If you're not
attracted to somebody,

37:29.982 --> 37:31.348
you don't hook up
with them for years.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.259
- That's from
a friend's perspective.

37:42.327 --> 37:45.729
I didn't insinuate
that we were doing

37:45.797 --> 37:48.298
really pretty much
anything else.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.100
- But did you?

37:52.304 --> 37:53.637
- We did.

37:53.705 --> 37:54.838
- He even went
to my Facebook

37:54.906 --> 37:56.840
yesterday, like,
to say, "What's up?"

37:56.908 --> 37:58.275
- Is that true?

37:58.343 --> 37:59.676
- Yeah.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.978
- Interesting.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.848
'Cause it kind of feels like...
- The plan...

38:04.916 --> 38:06.082
almost worked.
- Worked.

38:06.151 --> 38:07.884
- You got out here,
we got stood up,

38:07.953 --> 38:09.286
and you were like,

38:09.354 --> 38:11.121
"Ah, I got a friend
out here I could hit up."

38:11.189 --> 38:13.089
What has he done in the past
to give you the impression

38:13.158 --> 38:14.858
that he does like you?

38:14.926 --> 38:17.894
- Well, we talk,
text, hang out.

38:30.208 --> 38:31.775
- All right,
look, what you did

38:31.843 --> 38:33.576
in pretending
to be someone else is wrong.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.744
- Is wrong, yeah.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.513
- But, arguably, what you did

38:36.581 --> 38:39.716
for the four or five years
you guys been friends is a...

38:39.785 --> 38:41.284
- Not communicate.

38:41.353 --> 38:44.888
- Different but similar
version of misleading him.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.157
So that's where we're at.

38:47.225 --> 38:48.191
What now?

38:48.260 --> 38:49.559
What do you want?

38:49.628 --> 38:51.594
- I would like to say
still be friends at least,

38:51.663 --> 38:53.997
but I don't know
what Deven wants.

38:54.066 --> 38:55.498
- Yeah, but forget
what he wants.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.233
What do you want?

38:59.104 --> 39:00.770
- You have strong feelings
for him.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.539
- Yeah.

39:02.607 --> 39:06.743
- If you look at it from, like,
say, one of ours perspective,

39:06.812 --> 39:09.312
it don't sound too great,
that five years.

39:09.381 --> 39:11.147
You feel like
you deserve that?

39:11.216 --> 39:12.549
- No.

39:12.617 --> 39:13.683
- I like her.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.318
I like her.
- [laughs]

39:17.589 --> 39:21.124
- Deven, how do you feel?
What do you want?

39:22.928 --> 39:26.096
- There is definitely
a possibility

39:26.164 --> 39:28.365
that we could
still be friends.

39:28.433 --> 39:30.567
- But you don't
want a relationship

39:30.635 --> 39:32.535
in any romantic way...
- Right.

39:32.604 --> 39:36.506
- Which, if I'm going
to give my opinion, means

39:36.575 --> 39:39.809
you should stop hooking up.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.111
- Okay.

39:41.179 --> 39:42.145
- Thanks.

39:42.214 --> 39:43.380
- I think that would make it

39:43.448 --> 39:47.150
easier and clearer
for both of you.

39:48.353 --> 39:49.619
- Whew.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.087
- Okay.

39:51.156 --> 39:53.189
Sometimes saying the thing
that hurts in the moment

39:53.258 --> 39:56.326
actually hurts a lot less
over time.

39:56.395 --> 39:58.061
- That's a hard lesson
to learn, though.

39:58.130 --> 40:00.397

40:00.465 --> 40:03.466

you keep her around.

Are you a little sad
that James is gone?

40:28.894 --> 40:30.693
- Little bit, yeah.

40:30.762 --> 40:34.330
- Are you a little sad that,
like, Sha'Quan is gone?

40:34.399 --> 40:38.001
- In a way.
