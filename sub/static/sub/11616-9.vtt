00:00.334 --> 00:02.935
The eyes of the world are on us.

00:02.937 --> 00:04.737
Once that virus is out,
it is out.

00:04.872 --> 00:07.072
WOMAN:<i> He's a child. </i>
I don't get sick.

00:07.074 --> 00:09.341
Thomas's cells contain
the blueprint for a cure.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.810
LOMMERS:<i> I need you to help me</i>
<i> sneak him out of the Cordon.</i>

00:11.812 --> 00:14.079
If this is just
a moment in time,

00:14.081 --> 00:16.315
I just want you to know
I'm still glad I met you.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.883
JAKE:
<i> There's no version of my life</i>

00:17.885 --> 00:19.218
<i> that doesn't have you in it.</i>

00:20.654 --> 00:22.588
We have to find
a way out of the Cordon.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.256
I think we're being lied to.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.357
I saw two bodies--

00:25.359 --> 00:26.792
they were both dead
before Patient Zero.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.094
JAKE:<i> Surveillance footage from</i>
<i> the day the outbreak started.</i>

00:29.096 --> 00:30.129
<i> Henry Burns.</i>

00:30.131 --> 00:32.364
<i> He's the real Patient Zero.</i>

00:32.366 --> 00:36.201
A biohazard package was
delivered to Burns from the CDC.

00:36.203 --> 00:39.004
LEX:<i> But guess who paid for it.</i>
<i> Dr. Victor Cannerts.</i>

00:39.006 --> 00:41.240

<i> (Cannerts shouts)</i>

00:41.242 --> 00:43.108
Thomas is
an asymptomatic carrier.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.344
If Thomas leaves the Cordon,
the virus leaves with him!

00:45.346 --> 00:46.712
THOMAS:
Miss Katie!

00:46.714 --> 00:47.946
You need to
take him back!

00:47.948 --> 00:49.114
They're letting people out!

00:50.317 --> 00:52.117
You'll be quarantined here
for 48 hours.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.485
Get out of my way.
(guns cock)

00:53.487 --> 00:54.720
I didn't even touch him.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.155

I did.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.793

MAN:
We know you're in there!

01:17.011 --> 01:19.578
This location was a bad idea!

01:19.580 --> 01:20.879
It would have
been fine

01:20.881 --> 01:22.381
if things had gone to plan.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.184
Lose your gloves.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.319
You touched him,
with your gloves.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.822
Thought this thing was only
transmitted through fluids.

01:29.824 --> 01:32.891
MAN: You cage us like animals
and leave us out here to die!

01:32.893 --> 01:34.993
WOMAN:
Open up!

01:34.995 --> 01:37.029
We're getting out!

01:37.031 --> 01:38.330
Your job was to find a spot

01:38.332 --> 01:40.265
where they would not see us
taking the child.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.233
And they didn't!

01:41.235 --> 01:43.569
We weren't supposed to send him
back in there!

01:43.571 --> 01:46.105
Dr. Cannerts assured me
that Thomas was not infectious,

01:46.107 --> 01:48.006
that his body had eradicated
the virus,

01:48.008 --> 01:49.908
that he was the blueprint
to the cure.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.777
(clamoring continues outside)

01:56.917 --> 02:00.185
The only mistake I made
was trusting him.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.531
What's happening out there?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.266
They're leaving.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.934
Why?

02:17.171 --> 02:19.938
My guess is to get more people.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.946
CANNERTS:<i> I must declare</i>

02:27.948 --> 02:31.216

I'm okay.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.703
Now I get to
stay with you.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.372
You're amazing, Thomas.

02:53.374 --> 02:56.108
Do you still think
I have superpowers?

02:56.110 --> 02:59.278
People seem kind of...
scared of me now.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.546
Are you kidding?

03:00.548 --> 03:02.614
Your powers
just got stronger.

03:06.020 --> 03:06.985
Thanks, Miss Katie.

03:06.987 --> 03:10.489
Do you think Quentin
wants to play cards?

03:10.491 --> 03:11.890
I'm sure he does.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.258
I'll ask him.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.632
Hey.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.234
You're as tough
as they come, bud.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.602
Huh?

03:23.604 --> 03:25.270
Oh, wow.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.808
Hey. You okay?

03:29.810 --> 03:30.909
I don't like this.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.145
Cannerts has been lying
to us since day one.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.813
I don't like leaving
Thomas in his care.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.149
That boy should be with me.
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

03:37.151 --> 03:39.484
He should be, okay?
But that is not an option.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.820
Look, Cannerts wants to see the
antidote just as bad as the rest of us.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.289
So now you trust him all of a sudden?
No, no, of course not.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.059
Okay, but right now, he's the
best chance any of us have got.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.594
(door closes)

03:48.596 --> 03:49.728
KATIE:
Hi, Bert.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.762
Everything all right?

03:50.764 --> 03:53.198
Dr. Cannerts asked me to come by
and check on Thomas for him.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.466
Why didn't he come himself?

03:54.468 --> 03:56.768
The doctor has quarantined
himself in his lab,

03:56.770 --> 03:58.637
because of how close
he worked with the boy.

03:58.639 --> 03:59.638
He'll be fine.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.505
We're still
in good hands.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.840
Yeah, I'm sure
you're right.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.610
You two need to smile more.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.645
You look good
together.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.946
I met my Michi

04:07.948 --> 04:09.414
during dark times
as well.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.650
But we made a point
to try to change that.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.051
Spread a little sunshine.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.353
She sounds wonderful.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.454
And then some.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.657
I'll go check on the boy
so I can get back to her.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.891
Got to get
some medicine to her.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.293
She okay?

04:21.295 --> 04:23.929
Got a cut on her leg.
I'll take good care of her.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.797
You two...

04:25.799 --> 04:27.099
spread that sunshine.

04:27.101 --> 04:28.634
Yeah, thanks.
We will.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.426
Xander?

04:54.428 --> 04:56.962

and got out of here.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.000

05:03.937 --> 05:06.405
Awesome.
Just the way we left it.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.775
Only now it smells like meth.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.677
If this is gonna be home,
we better get cleaning.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.111
Ya think?

05:13.113 --> 05:15.280
Easy, Suzy.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.516
Maybe Dennis was right
to ditch us.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.625
(exhales) I'm not
sure I can make it.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.093
One step at a time.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.695
Our girl deserves
a clean home

05:29.697 --> 05:30.896
to welcome her
into this world.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.398
And your grandparents will be
happy to see you. (groans)

05:33.400 --> 05:36.335
It's like a bowling ball
in my spine.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.136
She's gonna be
a tough one.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.838
Hardheaded, just like her daddy.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.707
More like thick-skulled.
(glass shatters in distance)

05:41.709 --> 05:43.542
Right now this thick skull

05:43.544 --> 05:45.777
is set on getting you
to your grandma's, so...

05:45.779 --> 05:47.079
keep those feet moving.

05:47.081 --> 05:48.613
I hate you so much.

05:48.615 --> 05:49.948
Yeah, I know you do.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.050
Come on.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.920
But he's not sick, right?

05:54.922 --> 05:55.921
No, Mary, Thomas is fine.

05:55.923 --> 05:59.424
He... he just needs to stay
in his own room from now on.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.593
They've been yanking
our chain this whole time.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.862
There's no reason these kids
should be in here.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.863
If they're not sick,

06:04.865 --> 06:05.897
they should go home.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.166
Hey, Ray, will you try
to stay positive on this?

06:08.168 --> 06:10.936
Hey, you know what I think
Thomas would love, guys?

06:10.938 --> 06:13.438
His freedom?

06:13.440 --> 06:14.773
A game.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.442
Yeah?
Oh, what a great idea.

06:17.444 --> 06:20.178
Why don't you guys go
make him a new board game?

06:20.180 --> 06:21.913
He would definitely like that.
Come on.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.448
Masks, please.

06:23.450 --> 06:26.485
Ray, could you keep
an eye on them?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.921
Nice work.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.490
Well, just spreading sunshine.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.524
(laughs)

06:32.526 --> 06:33.892
Hey, uh...

06:33.894 --> 06:37.095
so I was thinking about
that date we were planning.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.530
Seemed a lot more fun
to talk about it

06:38.532 --> 06:40.098
when we thought we might
be getting out of here.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.734
Yeah, I'm not sure
I'm willing to wait for that.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.337
Normally, I'd push for,
uh, you know, dinner,

06:45.339 --> 06:46.938
large amounts of alcohol,

06:46.940 --> 06:49.141
but you seem to be
breaking all my rules,

06:49.143 --> 06:50.942
so how about lunch?

06:50.944 --> 06:52.878
Lunch?

06:52.880 --> 06:55.580
Yeah, isn't that something girls
do for, like, a first date?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.349
To see if they're
interested in a guy?

06:57.351 --> 06:59.351
Yeah. But that
generally happens

06:59.353 --> 07:01.420
well before they
shower together.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.322
Well, we can skip to that part
again, if you want.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.024
I mean, it was...
No, no, no, no.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.393
I like this new you.
Very respectable.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.862
I could do lunch.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.098
Great.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.271
Lex, this is not a good time

07:19.273 --> 07:21.206
This lab journal links Cannerts
to the virus,

07:21.208 --> 07:22.407
but I can't do anything with it.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.775
What I need is proof
that Patient Zero

07:23.777 --> 07:26.244
called Cannerts when he realized
he was infected.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.679
I have got to have
those phone records, man.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.749
They're gonna show that Cannerts
knew exactly when and how

07:30.751 --> 07:32.284
this virus got out.

07:35.756 --> 07:39.124
All right? Don't make me
do this without you.

07:41.395 --> 07:44.029
LOMMERS:
There's still no sign of them.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.564
Oh, they're out there.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.099
Anger like that
won't die down easy.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.267
A demonstration
is the worst thing

07:49.269 --> 07:50.368
that could happen in there.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.404
We cut them off from the world.

07:52.406 --> 07:53.638
Told them things
would get better

07:53.640 --> 07:54.840
when they were
only getting worse.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.576
You can only lock people
up and lie to them

07:57.578 --> 07:59.778
for so long before they revolt.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.112
And that would be suicide.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.080
We can't let that happen.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.648
So you got a plan to stop it?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.116
(door opens)

08:07.688 --> 08:09.020
Stand back, please.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.255
I need to speak
to Captain Scott.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.389
Food and water for two days.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.558
Empty the bucket,
use it for waste.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.327
There were people
outside this container.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.461
We're aware. They've moved on.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.197
Moved on how?
Have they dispersed?

08:19.199 --> 08:20.398
They're protesting
in the street.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.800
We'll keep an
eye on them.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.735
How many are there?

08:25.973 --> 08:27.038
Stay hydrated.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.440
I need a line

08:28.442 --> 08:29.541

his people are

08:29.543 --> 08:30.709
gathering close together,
and any of them

08:30.711 --> 08:33.445
are infected, the virus
will spread like wildfire.

08:33.447 --> 08:35.480

continues)

08:47.794 --> 08:49.494
Come on!

08:58.272 --> 09:00.939
I'm not saying it's
not a pretty name.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.173
It's just...

09:02.175 --> 09:03.942
You know what?

09:03.944 --> 09:05.210
Maybe it'll grow on me.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.945

09:06.947 --> 09:08.713
Stay right here.

way too close together.

09:24.464 --> 09:27.265
That's the way
to my grandma's.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.268
Come on.
We don't want to go

09:30.270 --> 09:32.370
anywhere near
that madness.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.005
No, we'll wait it out.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.407
You know, let it die down.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.875
(sighs):
Okay.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.777
Tell baby Caitlin
to hang tough.

09:38.779 --> 09:42.514
Mm. Yeah, when I hear you say
it, I kind of hate it, too.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.883
Yeah. We'll find her a name.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.251
I promise.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.953
(sighs)

09:54.995 --> 09:57.095
Mom, have you seen my cards?

09:57.097 --> 09:59.164
Check under your cot, baby.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.699
Thanks.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.270
I think it looks
prettier down.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.439
Oh, do you?

10:07.441 --> 10:09.441
Who says I'm trying
to look prettier?

10:09.443 --> 10:11.142
Maybe I want
to look smart

10:11.144 --> 10:13.545
or kind or funny.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.146
You like him, don't you?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.448
(chuckles softly)

10:17.618 --> 10:19.017
Maybe.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.185
Do you?

10:20.187 --> 10:23.722
He says we're going to a Hawks
game when we get out of here.

10:23.724 --> 10:27.292
Just the two of you,
or... am I allowed to come?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.426
I guess you could come.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.929
We'll make it, like,
a family thing almost.

10:30.931 --> 10:34.733
Let's not get
too ahead of ourselves.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.836
Go have fun.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.172
Your hair is fine.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.741
Either way, you look pretty.

10:50.584 --> 10:53.985
No disinfectant, no
bleach, no fresh gloves.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.154
How long does it take
to hunt down a walkie?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.590
Maybe if you pace faster,
it'll speed things up.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.325
What is your issue with me,
Major?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.459
I have given you

11:01.461 --> 11:02.394
nothing but opportunities.

11:02.396 --> 11:03.928
To do what, exactly?

11:03.930 --> 11:05.096
Be your puppet?

11:05.098 --> 11:06.898
To smile and lie for you?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.500
Information needs to be managed
in a crisis.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.834
I thought you understood that.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.036
Oh, I do.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.471
But you're managing
what you tell me just as much.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.040
When have I ever been
less than honest with you?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.442
You can start with the day
you showed up here

11:17.444 --> 11:19.511
saying this would all be over
before it began.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.247
Truth is, you knew better
from day one. Did I?

11:22.249 --> 11:25.016
There is no way these shipping
containers show up here so fast

11:25.018 --> 11:27.919
unless you ordered them
before you even got on a plane.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.688
And what about the cell
towers that were prepped

11:29.690 --> 11:31.489
to go dark on
your command?

11:31.491 --> 11:34.092
Those are not steps you take
in a crisis

11:34.094 --> 11:37.195
you plan to be over in 48 hours.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.763
You're right.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.965
I had the containers
and the phone companies

11:40.967 --> 11:41.900
on hold from day one.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.702
What are you accusing me of,
being prepared?

11:43.704 --> 11:45.904
I'm accusing you of knowing
more than you let on.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.039
What really happened when
that virus broke out?

11:48.041 --> 11:51.976
What is it that you
don't want to tell me?

11:51.978 --> 11:53.912
The enemies I fight, Lex,

11:53.914 --> 11:56.081
don't give a rat's ass
about humanity.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.250
A virus doesn't care about
politics or race or emotion.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.187
The truth is, I had no idea

12:02.189 --> 12:04.489
where this outbreak was going.

12:05.659 --> 12:08.626
But I made damn sure
I was prepared to stop it.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.933
Next time, that's what you say
on day one.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.308
This would go a lot faster
if there was three of us.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.576
She just needs space.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.544
She's pretty broken up
about Dennis leaving.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.446
Yeah, I kind of
picked up on that.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.547
I'll go talk to her.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.049
All right,
I'll take this stuff down,

12:31.051 --> 12:33.151
hit the supply room
for some disinfectant.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.452
(beep)

12:40.994 --> 12:42.460
Suze?

12:45.398 --> 12:47.599
Hey, Suzy?

12:53.206 --> 12:54.806
Suzy?

12:58.245 --> 13:00.445
Suzy?

13:04.050 --> 13:05.717
<i> (knocking)</i>

13:05.719 --> 13:07.218
Hey, you got a
small cheese here?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.854
Yeah, just throw it on the table
anywhere, please.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.293
Would you mind if I
borrow your work phone?

13:15.295 --> 13:17.629
My work phone? Yeah, your boss
gives you a phone so his business

13:17.631 --> 13:18.763
pops up on a customer's

13:18.765 --> 13:20.131
caller ID when you call.
May I borrow it?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.100
What's wrong with yours?
Oh, it died.

13:22.102 --> 13:22.967
It's a long story.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.602
No, no, no, you
keep the change.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.770
Just let me use your phone.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.505
Just make it quick.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.374
(dialing)

13:29.376 --> 13:30.842
(line ringing)

13:30.844 --> 13:32.343
WOMAN:
This is Nancy.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.046
Hi, Nancy, this is... Chip

13:35.048 --> 13:35.814
with Cheesy Pies.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.016
I have a delivery
for 1132 Bay.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.385
Uh, no. I-I'm sorry.
The wrong number.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.986
Uh, I don't think it is, Nancy.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.222
I have a custom pie here,
which is not something

13:44.224 --> 13:45.390
you want to let go to waste.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.126
I didn't order a pizza
and I don't want a pizza.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.962
Trust me, you want this one.
15 minutes.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.797
Thank you.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.635
CROWD (chanting):
We want out! We want out!

13:57.637 --> 13:59.504
(chanting continues,
motorcycle revving)

14:03.777 --> 14:05.810
It's getting worse.

14:05.812 --> 14:08.746
We can either turn back
or we can go for it right now.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.915
TERESA:
I'm not turning back.

14:10.917 --> 14:14.085
All right, don't stop moving.
Slow and steady. Come on.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.687
Okay.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.024
Mom?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.860
Mom!
Easy, Tee, that wasn't your mom.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.429
Yes, it is! It's a long block; you
probably didn't get a good look!

14:24.431 --> 14:25.496
That's my mom, Xander!
All right!

14:25.498 --> 14:26.564
TERESA:
I made her that jacket!

14:26.566 --> 14:28.166
Okay...
Mom!

14:28.168 --> 14:29.667
All right!
Can you stop her, please?

14:29.669 --> 14:31.069
Even if she's sick,
I need to see her.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.705
Tee, Tee, it's been
almost four days.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.941
You know what, all right.
Here, hold this.

14:36.943 --> 14:39.811
Don't stop moving, all right?
I'll find you.

14:39.813 --> 14:43.114
Just... keep your distance.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.195
Hello?

14:57.197 --> 14:59.464
Jake?

14:59.466 --> 15:01.165

That was beautiful.
So good.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.321
Where did you find that guitar?

15:23.323 --> 15:24.923
It was in the chapel.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.457
It was this
or the electric organ.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.892
Guitar was lighter.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.661
Right.

15:29.663 --> 15:31.462

Oh, wow, I do.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.469
Actually, I'm a little...
a little jealous.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.637
I could check in
the lost and found,

15:39.639 --> 15:40.772
see if they've got another pair.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.607
Please do that.
(laughs)

15:44.411 --> 15:46.010
So, what's on the menu?

15:46.012 --> 15:49.247
Oh, well, we have
a, uh, a fine assortment

15:49.249 --> 15:51.115
of dehydrated meals.

15:51.117 --> 15:54.352
Um, I hear
the vegetarian taco pasta

15:54.354 --> 15:55.887
is-is heavenly.

15:55.889 --> 15:57.021
Is that right? Okay.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.057
Yes, and we also have
some dried fruit.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.292

16:01.294 --> 16:03.795

16:08.668 --> 16:10.835
(both laugh)

16:16.209 --> 16:18.209
You play?
Hmm?

16:19.980 --> 16:21.212
A little.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.317
Hmm?

16:26.319 --> 16:28.553
I never play for anyone
except Quentin.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.054
Please.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.359
Fine, but you cannot laugh.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.327
Wouldn't dream of it.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.665
I'm not gonna
look at you while you...

16:40.667 --> 16:42.834
Don't. Close your eyes.
Nope.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.324
He tried
taking me, too,

17:40.326 --> 17:41.359
but I wouldn't go.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.160
What?

17:42.162 --> 17:43.895
He said people are breaking out.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.499
Did you see
where they went?

17:48.501 --> 17:49.534
No.

17:49.536 --> 17:50.768
Come on, bud.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.445
(people chattering)

18:06.953 --> 18:09.320
I swear you look more beautiful
every time I see you.

18:09.322 --> 18:12.256
Can it. This better be
end-of-days important, Leo.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.058
You know better than
to call me at work.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.726
No, that was
a legit pizza phone.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.129
You got nothing to worry about.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.531
So I assume you heard about
Melinda and Allie.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.267
You posted images of
their bodies on the Internet.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.169
And that's exactly
what they would have wanted.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.305
You're probably right.

18:27.307 --> 18:31.342
Once again,
I'm the minority voice.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.610
Why am I here?

18:32.612 --> 18:35.113
Because I'm about to find out
why they died.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.048
This virus

18:37.050 --> 18:39.784
was created by a doctor
at the CDC.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.119
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.454
No, I have proof.
I have hard, factual proof

18:43.456 --> 18:45.690
that this doctor was working
with this virus...

18:45.692 --> 18:46.991
Leo...
...prior to the outbreak.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.426
I work for the NSA.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.161
Do you have any idea
how many resources

18:50.163 --> 18:52.230
we have devoted to finding
the cause of this?

18:52.232 --> 18:54.432
You're looking
in the wrong places.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.234
But you've cracked it
single-handed.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.969
Look, all I need
is a phone record.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.504
Maybe the transcript of a call.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.371
Oh, is that all?

19:00.373 --> 19:02.707
So I just need to
abuse my NSA access

19:02.709 --> 19:04.909
and commit a federal
crime. Perfect.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.878
Just hear me out, please.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.779
The call was made
by Patient Zero--

19:08.781 --> 19:11.649
the real Patient Zero-- the
moment he realized he was sick.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.251
Now, I have footage
of all this.

19:13.253 --> 19:16.387
Whoever he spoke to
made him dump his I.D.,

19:16.389 --> 19:17.822
his phone, everything.

19:17.824 --> 19:21.726
Then he put himself in isolation
and tried to remain anonymous.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.094
That's his name and the time

19:23.096 --> 19:25.263
he made the call
from his phone.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.735
Why should I risk
everything I have for this?

19:30.737 --> 19:33.538
It won't bring
them back.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.705
Won't save any lives.

19:34.707 --> 19:35.840
No, it won't.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.209
But our friends died
searching for the truth,

19:38.211 --> 19:40.845
and you're just a few keystrokes
away from finding it.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.549
You really
want to deny them that?

19:54.093 --> 19:57.862
CROWD (chanting):
We want out! We want out!

19:57.864 --> 19:59.463
(chanting continues)
XANDER: Leanne!

19:59.465 --> 20:02.400
Leanne!

20:04.337 --> 20:07.438
Hey, hey, help me,
man. Please.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.507
Help...

20:10.843 --> 20:12.443
You're welcome.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.046
(chanting continues)

20:23.823 --> 20:25.189
(motorcycle approaching)

20:26.593 --> 20:28.159
Give me your stuff!

20:29.696 --> 20:31.996
(groaning):
Oh. Oh.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.868
LOMMERS:
You want to go find your girl?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.303
Now's your chance.

20:39.305 --> 20:43.074
No one in, no one out,
Dr. Lommers.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.678
She must be very special.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.647
She is.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.315
Smart.

20:51.317 --> 20:54.085
Smart like you wouldn't believe.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.821
And driven.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.089
Beautiful.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.924
Met her at a bar,

20:59.926 --> 21:01.959
if you can believe that.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.462
My buddy Jake's
birthday.

21:04.464 --> 21:08.065
She threw an elbow
at this guy who tried to do

21:08.067 --> 21:09.700
a body shot
off her neck.

21:09.702 --> 21:10.935
(laughing)

21:10.937 --> 21:14.205
Bastard tried to press charges.

21:15.174 --> 21:17.074
(laughs):
Yeah.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.847
Well...

21:22.849 --> 21:25.016
my husband and I...

21:26.819 --> 21:28.586
...met in graduate school.

21:28.588 --> 21:29.654
He was...

21:29.656 --> 21:31.088
(door opening)

21:34.060 --> 21:37.628
Captain Scott is on for you.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.931
Captain.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.233
We have a situation.

21:42.235 --> 21:44.368
The group of protestors
is growing.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.370
We're concerned they may attack
one of our sluices.

21:46.372 --> 21:47.471
If there's enough of them,

21:47.473 --> 21:48.706
they'll pull the doors
right off.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.074
We can't allow that.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.375
Understood.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.644
We positioned a food supply
in front of each sluice

21:53.646 --> 21:54.979
aimed to dissipate their intent.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.447
You need
to be positioning snipers.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.648
It's not the National Guard's

21:57.650 --> 21:59.483
practice to fire upon
unarmed Americans.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.086
Captain,
if you let this virus out,

22:02.088 --> 22:04.255
there won't be
any Americans left.

22:06.225 --> 22:07.892
Yeah, I'll take that
under advisement.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.226
Over and out.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.800
Anything?

22:15.802 --> 22:18.235
I checked every floor;
there's no sign of her.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.137
She wouldn't just
run away, would she?

22:20.139 --> 22:22.006
Wouldn't be the first time.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.008
Where the hell were you?

22:24.010 --> 22:25.176
On the roof.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.410
Why? Is that a problem?

22:26.412 --> 22:28.045
When you don't tell anyone, yes.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.146
Well, you guys
were busy playing house.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.281
I figured you wouldn't care.

22:30.283 --> 22:31.449
Wouldn't care?
Suzy, I have been

22:31.451 --> 22:33.451
a wreck searching for you.
Whatever!

22:33.453 --> 22:36.153
Okay, so there's a prison break
going on out there.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.722
People are busting out.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.023
I say we join them.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.491
What are you talking about?

22:40.493 --> 22:42.326
Protestors, hundreds of them.

22:42.328 --> 22:43.427
I saw it from the roof.

22:43.429 --> 22:45.162
They're gonna break
through the barricade.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.530
Suzy, that's insane.

22:46.532 --> 22:50.468
This whole thing
is insane, Jana.

22:50.470 --> 22:54.038
Well, you guys can stay here
and rot if you want,

22:54.040 --> 22:56.273
but I'm getting out.

22:58.678 --> 23:02.012
(crowd chanting, clamoring,
saw whirring)

23:03.983 --> 23:05.616
MAN:
Hey, get me out of here!

23:10.857 --> 23:13.190
(woman shouting)

23:13.192 --> 23:15.793
CROWD (chanting):
We want out! We want out!

23:15.795 --> 23:17.161
This isn't good.

23:17.163 --> 23:20.164
I don't see them.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.032
(engine revving,
chanting continues)

23:24.937 --> 23:26.904
MAN:
Let's get out of here!

23:26.906 --> 23:28.939
(tires screeching)

23:28.941 --> 23:30.107
Come on.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.742
What's wrong?

23:31.744 --> 23:32.977
My uniform.

23:32.979 --> 23:34.578
I'm a moving target
in this thing.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.213
Here. I'll ditch the gear
and circle back.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.215
Just tuck in here.
I'll be right back.

23:47.059 --> 23:49.393
Remember when you were a kid,

23:49.395 --> 23:51.662
and you thought that
the grown-ups knew everything,

23:51.664 --> 23:54.632
and the president was
the smartest man on the planet?

23:54.634 --> 23:56.867
And you were
going to be an astronaut.

23:56.869 --> 23:58.536
I was gonna be the president.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.138
(both chuckle)

24:01.140 --> 24:02.373
Yeah.

24:02.375 --> 24:04.074
And then
the older you get,

24:04.076 --> 24:05.609
the more you realize
how rare it is

24:05.611 --> 24:08.245
that someone who deserves
to be making

24:08.247 --> 24:11.081
the important decisions
is actually in power to do so.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.983
And that
if you want to be

24:12.985 --> 24:16.253
one of them...

24:16.255 --> 24:18.422
you better be tough as nails.

24:18.424 --> 24:20.691
Oh, I'd say
you got that covered.

24:22.562 --> 24:26.831
If that were true, I wouldn't be
sitting in this box,

24:26.833 --> 24:29.300
terrified that we're both
gonna die.

24:29.302 --> 24:32.036
(walkie-talkie chirps)

24:32.038 --> 24:34.271
This is Lommers.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.006
SCOTT:
They're at the sluice.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.107
Food didn't work.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.143
They're prying at the hinges.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.544
Position snipers.

24:40.546 --> 24:42.446
Use tear gas
and water cannons first,

24:42.448 --> 24:45.015
snipers if there's any risk
of a breach.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.016
Negative.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.751
Captain, a breach
cannot happen.

24:47.753 --> 24:49.186
And it won't.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.721
I'm sending in a unit
to subdue the crowd.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.289
Negative. Captain,
that is a negative.

24:52.291 --> 24:54.859
Under no circumstances
are you to send in troops.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.127
We have no tear gas
or water cannons on site,

24:57.129 --> 24:58.996
and I'm not using snipers.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.030
My men are going in.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.199
Captain, you
will sentence

25:02.201 --> 25:03.367
your men to
die in there.

25:03.369 --> 25:04.902
Do not do this.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.037
My men are not the APD, Major.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.405
They're trained for this.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.040
People need reassurance.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.042
They need to see
boots on the ground.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.278
Trust me, this is what we do.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.046
Captain, this is a
different situation.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.015
You are dealing with
an active virus.

25:18.017 --> 25:21.352
Captain, I am forbidding you
from sending in your men.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.487
I've got
the governor's approval.

25:23.489 --> 25:25.222
I don't need your permission.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.034
(men chattering)

25:37.036 --> 25:39.169
MAN:
Keep it moving!

25:39.171 --> 25:41.639
I said, go!
Keep it moving!

25:41.641 --> 25:42.873
Face masks

25:42.875 --> 25:44.275
down at all times!

25:44.277 --> 25:46.277
Avoid physical contact!

25:46.279 --> 25:47.845
LEX (over walkie-talkie): Captain Scott...
MAN: Understood, sir.

25:47.847 --> 25:50.614
Do not fire
unless in self-defense.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.950
LEX:
Captain Scott.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.084
(walkie-talkie beeps)

25:54.086 --> 25:55.352
Let's move.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.490
He turned it off.

25:59.492 --> 26:01.191
(helicopter whirring
in distance)

26:03.529 --> 26:06.597
I've managed more than
20 epidemics in my career.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.500
And this is the one I lose to?

26:09.502 --> 26:10.935
(siren wailing in distance)

26:10.937 --> 26:15.472
Do you know what happens
to a virus when its host dies?

26:15.474 --> 26:17.474
The virus dies with it.

26:17.476 --> 26:20.911
Doesn't serve the virus
to kill its host so quickly.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.446
It's suicide.

26:22.448 --> 26:25.316
A smart virus
keeps its host alive.

26:25.318 --> 26:27.084
Hepatitis,

26:27.086 --> 26:28.519
polio, HIV.

26:28.521 --> 26:31.021
Beautiful, evolved viruses.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.890
This virus?

26:32.892 --> 26:34.858
It isn't smart

26:34.860 --> 26:35.926
or elegant.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.194
It's just brutal
and short-sighted,

26:37.196 --> 26:39.797
and it doesn't deserve to win.
And it won't.

26:39.799 --> 26:42.967
Sending those men in may be a
mistake, but that's not on you.

26:47.607 --> 26:49.840
Sabine,

26:49.842 --> 26:52.309
whatever happens,
you will fix it.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.044
No matter
what we face,

26:54.046 --> 26:57.281
when we get out of here,
this will still be your fight

26:57.283 --> 26:59.383
to fight.

26:59.385 --> 27:02.186
'Cause those people
inside the Cordon--

27:02.188 --> 27:04.722
they're gonna need you.

27:10.363 --> 27:11.729
If I didn't know better,

27:11.731 --> 27:14.732
I'd think
you were finally on my side.

27:17.536 --> 27:21.005
(clamoring, chanting continues)

27:21.007 --> 27:22.172
MAN:
Up! Pull it hard!

27:22.174 --> 27:24.608
Open up and pull it hard!

27:36.022 --> 27:37.121
Meese?

27:37.123 --> 27:39.323
What the hell are you doing?
Surviving.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.724
I need your help.
I'm looking for

27:40.726 --> 27:42.660
a guy with two 11-year-old girls.
Are you serious? What?

27:42.662 --> 27:44.728
You still playing cop?
Come on, Meese, let's go!

27:44.730 --> 27:45.863
Yeah, I'm still playing cop.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.765
You're running with
these guys now?

27:47.767 --> 27:49.466
Hey, don't guilt me.
At the end of the day,

27:49.468 --> 27:50.467
I'm gonna live through this.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.069
You know what happens to heroes.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.038
They die, Jake!

27:56.976 --> 27:59.009
You're not going out there.
Yeah, we'll see.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.345
Do you really think those
people stand a chance?

28:01.347 --> 28:02.680
Huh? Do you think
the government

28:02.682 --> 28:03.981
will actually
let them break free?

28:03.983 --> 28:06.250
They'll kill every one of us
before they let that happen.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.952
Gee, your boyfriend's really
fighting for the good guys,

28:08.954 --> 28:10.220
isn't he?

28:10.222 --> 28:11.889
Don't you dare
make this about Lex.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.358
Or me, or even about
being locked up in here.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.060
This is about Dennis,
nothing else.

28:16.062 --> 28:19.730
So whatever he did or said
is not my fault.

28:19.732 --> 28:22.800
Now, I have seen you through
a lot over the years, Suzy,

28:22.802 --> 28:26.170
but this Dennis thing--
this is small-time.

28:26.172 --> 28:28.539
I'm sorry that he left,
but that is what happens

28:28.541 --> 28:29.940
when you sleep with married men.

28:29.942 --> 28:33.777
They leave, and you knew that,
so get over it.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.383
I think I'm pregnant.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.419
(scoffs)

28:42.421 --> 28:44.121
(sighs)

28:46.525 --> 28:48.659
(clamoring continues,
glass breaking)

28:52.064 --> 28:53.497
Ray!

28:54.233 --> 28:55.532
Ray!

28:55.534 --> 28:57.301
Britney's under my care.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.770
If I decide to get out of here,
we're gonna get a...

28:59.772 --> 29:02.139
Listen, no one's getting out.
No one's getting out.

29:02.141 --> 29:03.140
(glass shattering)

29:03.142 --> 29:04.575
Where's Mary?

29:06.712 --> 29:07.878
What?

29:07.880 --> 29:08.712
We had to leave her.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.514
Leave her where? Why?

29:11.350 --> 29:12.816
She got sick.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.952
What, you mean like sick sick?

29:18.224 --> 29:19.556
(clamoring continues)

29:21.660 --> 29:24.595
CROWD (chanting):
We want out! We want out!

29:24.597 --> 29:27.564

29:27.566 --> 29:28.866

Beat him down! Come on!

29:34.006 --> 29:35.072

29:38.911 --> 29:41.478

29:43.315 --> 29:44.748

29:50.389 --> 29:51.488
Mary.

outside)

SCOTT: C Company,
you have a confirmed go.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.998
Keep your visors down

Go! Go! Go! Go!

30:52.685 --> 30:54.017
We're trying to help!

30:57.923 --> 30:59.823
Help me!

31:02.394 --> 31:03.627
Give me that!

31:06.065 --> 31:08.565

Hey, it's me!
Xander, thank God!

31:17.476 --> 31:19.776
Are you okay? I got knocked down.
They weren't sick.

31:19.778 --> 31:21.845
I just can't get up. Help me.
I can't, Tee.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.847
I bumped into someone.
I might be infected.

31:23.849 --> 31:26.717
What did you...?
Did you... did you touch them?

31:26.719 --> 31:28.518
I don't know.
I mean, it's crazy.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.987
I found the one lady in
the jacket; it wasn't your mom.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.289
Xander, that sick person--
did you touch them?

Inside! Inside!

31:57.983 --> 32:00.951
Please, take me with you.
I'm not sick.

32:00.953 --> 32:03.720
I'm sorry.
We were only trying to help.

32:07.226 --> 32:11.228
The first crisis I worked
was in Ghana.

32:11.230 --> 32:14.164
Some tropical bug

32:14.166 --> 32:17.234
was dotting the
countryside with corpses.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.569
My mentor at the time
was a British man,

32:19.571 --> 32:21.505
Dr. Hughes.

32:21.507 --> 32:24.207
Smart.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.909
Handsome.

32:27.413 --> 32:28.845
Nothing like that.

32:28.847 --> 32:31.848
He was much
older than me.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.083
He knew everything.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.852
He was three steps ahead
of the virus at every turn.

32:35.854 --> 32:38.588
I wanted to be like him.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.624
Then he got sick.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.060
He was dead within a week.

32:44.730 --> 32:48.298
Sorry to hear that.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.101
I knew in my line of work
there were inherent risks,

32:51.103 --> 32:53.637
but somehow I thought
that a man like that

32:53.639 --> 32:55.439
would be above them.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.174
Even the best cops get shot.

32:57.176 --> 33:00.777
Unfortunately, in this case,
it was his own fault.

33:00.779 --> 33:03.280
He'd grown close to
one of the patients,

33:03.282 --> 33:05.382
held the man's hand
when he was dying.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.818
He was... lost in the moment,

33:07.820 --> 33:10.087
didn't see the tear
in his glove.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.891
It was his compassion
that killed him.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.929

have a choice.

on a vacation I planned

That "Anonymous" you see
