01:27.954 --> 01:28.955
The apple is delicious.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.026
If you're throwing them out,

01:33.726 --> 01:34.861
could I have them?

01:35.795 --> 01:37.097
You see, I really love apples.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.777
I'm...

01:52.745 --> 01:54.013
going to run away.

01:55.014 --> 01:58.051
What's wrong with running away?

01:59.018 --> 02:00.887
I'm going to run away.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.702
Most girls look pretty when they cry,

02:18.505 --> 02:19.706
but crying doesn't suit you.

02:21.207 --> 02:22.108
Stop crying.

02:22.942 --> 02:23.776
Stop it.

03:31.844 --> 03:32.679
What is this?

03:33.346 --> 03:35.081
Loner and JB are an item?

03:36.583 --> 03:38.451
Really? Let me see.

03:38.851 --> 03:40.420
Oh, come on.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.123
Cell phones are banned.
How did you bring yours in?

03:44.891 --> 03:45.825
What?

03:45.892 --> 03:47.994
What kind of absurd regulation is that?

03:48.061 --> 03:48.895
The director--

03:49.762 --> 03:50.597
It's Si-u.

03:51.731 --> 03:55.001
They broke Kirin's no dating rule?

03:56.636 --> 03:57.470
This is unexpected.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.105
Si-u.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.078
You're back.

04:06.112 --> 04:07.347
You did the right thing.

04:08.448 --> 04:11.084
I told you not to be like this in public.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.420
You're so cute. I missed you.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.155
What took you so long?

04:16.889 --> 04:18.424
Were you worried about me?

04:19.158 --> 04:20.893
I took my time so that you would worry.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.763
You troublemaker.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.232
You won't cause me
any more grief, will you?

04:26.499 --> 04:29.102
No. I won't.

04:31.471 --> 04:33.139
I'm so proud of you.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.248
Why are you shivering?

04:42.849 --> 04:43.816
Are you not feeling well?

05:12.378 --> 05:13.346
You...

05:15.315 --> 05:17.850
You don't have to pity me.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.652
I don't pity you.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.622
It's just that I can't stand it
when girls cry.

05:42.608 --> 05:43.810
Just look at you.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.846
What did I tell you?

05:48.715 --> 05:50.917
I can't stand seeing you

05:52.518 --> 05:53.986
pick up dirt and crap.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.757
This is why

05:58.725 --> 06:01.661
losers like Shin Hae-seong think
they have a chance with you.

06:04.497 --> 06:08.501
You're the one who's been hanging out
with your loser bandmates.

06:10.636 --> 06:13.573
Shin Hae-seong is a loser,
but Jin Yu-jin isn't?

06:15.241 --> 06:19.112
Do you have an inferiority complex
toward Jin Yu-jin?

06:21.714 --> 06:22.882
I guess you do.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.718
Are you jealous of him?

06:27.687 --> 06:28.654
Are you...

06:30.056 --> 06:32.191
intentionally doing this to hurt me?

06:34.527 --> 06:35.695
If you are,

06:38.297 --> 06:39.265
then you're a screwup.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.403
Don't you know what screwup means?

06:45.171 --> 06:46.539
You're not thinking straight

06:46.606 --> 06:49.041
after being banned from the networks
and coming to this crappy school,

06:51.210 --> 06:53.913
but don't demean yourself

06:55.515 --> 06:56.916
by pitying a nobody like Shin Hae-seong.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.787
You're making me feel cheap too.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.490
-"Cheap"?
-Yes.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.195
You're making me regret

07:11.164 --> 07:12.965
all the time we spent together.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.404
Take that back.

07:20.807 --> 07:22.408
Stardom comes and goes.

07:24.076 --> 07:25.678
People are fickle.

07:29.248 --> 07:30.850
Let me give you a piece of advice.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.455
You really need to break that nasty habit

07:37.023 --> 07:38.524
of going soft on crying girls.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.628
I told you to take back what you said.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.434
Seeing you with Hae-seong...

07:50.803 --> 07:53.039
reminded me of why we broke up.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.346
You being weakhearted

08:02.748 --> 08:04.050
was a major screwup.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.256
I had hoped you would have changed,

08:12.325 --> 08:13.259
but you haven't.

08:41.988 --> 08:44.257
I thought you were completely incompetent,

08:45.791 --> 08:47.193
but I was wrong.

08:50.129 --> 08:53.332
It's not easy to get so much pity

08:54.200 --> 08:55.334
using nothing but apples.

08:56.002 --> 08:59.438
My father worked hard
to grow those apples,

09:00.907 --> 09:02.942
so mind what you say about them.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.977
Does your father know

09:06.178 --> 09:08.948
that you use those apples to seduce boys?

09:14.086 --> 09:16.122
I know what I did to you was wrong.

09:17.456 --> 09:19.792
It was my mistake because I was no good,

09:21.127 --> 09:22.962
so couldn't you forgive me

09:23.930 --> 09:24.997
as a friend?

09:26.332 --> 09:27.300
"As a friend"?

09:29.068 --> 09:30.002
Listen.

09:31.337 --> 09:34.206
You must be confused
because we go to the same school

09:34.907 --> 09:37.109
and use the same room,

09:38.778 --> 09:40.246
but I'm not your friend.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.350
Don't make a spectacle
of pretending to pack.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.885
If you're going to leave, make it quick.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.794
I'm leaving
so that I won't have to see you anymore.

09:55.294 --> 09:56.362
Don't worry.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.898
That's good news.

10:02.702 --> 10:03.936
Before you leave,

10:05.037 --> 10:06.906
consider getting changed.

10:08.641 --> 10:11.477
No need to advertise the fact
that you're an ugly duckling.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.516
It's like I'm seeing two of you.

10:18.217 --> 10:19.318
It's giving me a headache.

11:00.292 --> 11:01.527
What's wrong?

11:03.195 --> 11:05.064
Why are you torturing your guitar?

11:05.131 --> 11:06.065
I'm fine.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.634
I'm trying to arrange the song
Hae-seong wrote.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.507
Does playing it like that

11:15.975 --> 11:17.376
make you feel better?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.081
Do you want to try?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.503
Press down harder here.

11:45.304 --> 11:46.505
This is A minor.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.012
-There.
-Like this?

11:53.746 --> 11:54.747
And then here.

12:05.157 --> 12:08.594
I need to have a word.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.964
Would you give us some time alone?

12:14.567 --> 12:15.468
Just say it now.

12:23.142 --> 12:25.044
I'm sorry I walked away

12:26.746 --> 12:29.849
from our rehearsal on the street
the other day.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.253
Don't be sorry.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.223
It worked out for the better.

12:39.225 --> 12:42.027
The crowd loved hearing Rian sing anyway.

12:48.134 --> 12:49.135
Are you...

12:50.402 --> 12:52.338
still mad at me?

12:55.274 --> 12:57.643
Staying mad at you is a waste of time.

12:59.145 --> 13:00.479
I'm actually thankful.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.517
Imagine if you had run off
during the actual performance.

13:06.252 --> 13:07.720
Just thinking about it gives me chills.

13:10.322 --> 13:11.257
I guess you're right.

13:12.591 --> 13:13.492
What?

13:17.129 --> 13:18.497
Is that all you can say?

13:19.565 --> 13:23.335
Why do you want to become a singer anyway?

13:25.004 --> 13:27.006
If you're not talented,
you should at least have passion.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.178
I really don't get you.

13:33.779 --> 13:35.748
Do you enjoy being a nuisance to everyone?

13:36.348 --> 13:39.185
-How can you, of all people--
-You cry in front of anyone.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.155
You beg for pity.

13:44.990 --> 13:45.925
Are you trying...

13:47.993 --> 13:50.830
to act all distressed
in order to attract guys?

13:53.365 --> 13:55.701
How can you say that

13:56.735 --> 13:58.170
when you hardly even know me?

13:58.437 --> 14:00.639
I know you very well now.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.878
I know why you never passed
a single audition year after year.

14:07.646 --> 14:09.782
I can totally see why.
It's bizarre that you don't get it.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.119
You always act like
you are the only one struggling.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.723
I can't take your side anymore.

14:17.790 --> 14:18.624
So stop doing that.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.828
There's is no need
for you to do so anymore.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.467
That recorder.

14:30.469 --> 14:31.537
Give back my digital recorder.

15:12.111 --> 15:13.846
Why did you say things
that you didn't mean?

15:18.450 --> 15:19.285
I'm sorry.

15:20.185 --> 15:21.587
I'll teach you guitar some other time.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.034
I know

15:36.835 --> 15:38.570
you were being mean

15:40.272 --> 15:42.608
to motivate me.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.176
I really do.

15:46.245 --> 15:50.115
That's what you thought I would say,
didn't you, you nasty freak?

15:50.716 --> 15:53.485
You go back and forth with me
like a crazy person.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.989
Do you think

15:57.456 --> 16:00.159
being looked down on is easy for me?

16:01.493 --> 16:04.930
To people who are born talented
like you, I'm just a...

16:07.566 --> 16:10.336
Am I bipolar? What's wrong with me?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.738
Really? I feel the same way.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.508
I have highs and lows many times a day.

16:17.776 --> 16:19.144
What causes the highs and lows?

16:20.579 --> 16:24.183
When I don't see her, I get nervous,

16:25.217 --> 16:27.453
and when I see her, I feel great again.

16:28.854 --> 16:32.458
And when I see her with another guy,
I get angry.

16:33.025 --> 16:33.859
"Her"?

16:34.460 --> 16:35.661
Na-na, right?

16:36.929 --> 16:38.097
You like her, don't you?

16:38.530 --> 16:41.900
-No, I mean...
-Yes, you do.

16:42.401 --> 16:43.802
Did you fall for her during the duet?

16:44.870 --> 16:47.406
When you were happy
to give up all your parts,

16:47.473 --> 16:48.941
I knew something was up.

16:50.209 --> 16:53.012
-You're such an amateur.
-I'm not an amateur.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.346
Come on.

16:54.546 --> 16:55.814
You can't see things straight

16:55.881 --> 16:57.783
because of your one-sided love.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.284
That's being an amateur.

16:59.818 --> 17:00.953
It's not one-sided.

17:03.922 --> 17:04.757
She...

17:05.758 --> 17:06.692
likes me too.

17:09.928 --> 17:11.630
What makes you say that?

17:12.398 --> 17:13.699
"You're cute."

17:13.932 --> 17:15.300
She went like that.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.404
When girls say, "You're cute,"

17:19.071 --> 17:21.006
it's another way of saying, "I like you."

17:22.174 --> 17:26.578
She says that to Si-u
and just about every other guy.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.452
Be a man. Don't sulk.

17:37.756 --> 17:40.125
I don't feel sleepy at all.
I might as well go practice.

18:19.064 --> 18:20.399
Hello.

18:21.333 --> 18:26.572
I'm Shin Hae-seong,
a senior at Kirin Art School.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.777
"Hae" means "ocean." "Seong" means "star."

18:32.778 --> 18:34.246
I'm a star hidden in the ocean.

18:36.582 --> 18:41.153
Although I never got to deliver
a proper performance on this stage,

18:43.589 --> 18:44.923
I'm okay.

18:46.325 --> 18:50.062
Someday, I'll rise to the sky
and shine like the star I'm meant to be.

18:54.900 --> 18:55.767
"Hae-seong.

18:58.203 --> 19:02.908
Are you really planning to leave Kirin?"

19:05.377 --> 19:06.211
Yes.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.450
I'm giving up on my dream
to become a singer.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.952
I'm going to find something else to do.

19:15.988 --> 19:16.922
"I see.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.992
Then, Hae-seong,

19:20.926 --> 19:22.261
other than becoming a singer...

19:26.298 --> 19:27.399
Other than becoming a singer...

19:29.434 --> 19:32.404
have you thought of anything else
you would like to do?"

19:33.472 --> 19:34.306
Well...

19:36.642 --> 19:37.543
No.

19:41.046 --> 19:41.880
No.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.618
Other than becoming a singer,

19:48.187 --> 19:50.455
I haven't really thought about
doing anything else.

20:00.499 --> 20:02.534
Next up is number 314, Jang U-jae.

20:02.801 --> 20:03.702
U-jae.

20:04.970 --> 20:09.241
U-jae, don't waste your time.
Think of something else to do.

20:10.742 --> 20:13.278
There's nothing else for me, if not this.

20:16.782 --> 20:17.616
What?

20:26.758 --> 20:27.693
Please help me.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.928
If I don't pass,

20:30.729 --> 20:32.097
I'll die.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.168
-You would be saving my life--
-U-jae.

20:36.602 --> 20:37.469
U-jae.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.372
Going on your knees is very passé.

20:40.439 --> 20:43.942
Just today, four kids before you kneeled
and said they would die.

20:45.143 --> 20:47.112
But I can't save everyone, can I?

20:49.948 --> 20:51.283
Run along.

20:51.650 --> 20:52.751
Next!

20:55.587 --> 20:56.888
Did you say your name was Jang U-jae?

21:02.694 --> 21:06.598
You know, studying and hard work alone
won't make you good at music.

21:07.666 --> 21:11.737
You need innate talent,
inspiration, and sensibility.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.171
Don't you think so?

21:16.141 --> 21:18.810
You shouldn't just mimic
whoever you think is cool.

21:20.579 --> 21:22.848
You're a dancer. Where's your confidence?

21:22.914 --> 21:26.618
Look at your sagging shoulders.
Sit up straight.

21:27.085 --> 21:30.989
Straighten your back,
and pull in your chin.

21:31.056 --> 21:32.658
Be proud. Be strong.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.893
You hunched too low
when you were playing the guitar.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.762
Look at me. Be confident.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.099
I own G minor. That's confidence.

22:24.676 --> 22:31.650
FOR HAE-SEONG

22:37.456 --> 22:38.423
Sam-dong.

22:38.757 --> 22:41.059
I want my cell phone back,
and I want to date.

22:41.126 --> 22:42.894
Why do I want to do everything
I am not allowed to?

22:42.961 --> 22:44.029
What am I supposed to do?

22:45.163 --> 22:47.432
It's time to sleep. Let's go to bed.

22:49.234 --> 22:50.068
What is this?

22:51.303 --> 22:52.304
Who turned off the lights?

22:52.604 --> 22:53.872
It's lights out.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.375
They turn off all the lights in the dorm
at midnight.

22:59.778 --> 23:02.280
What? That's so stupid.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.817
Don't take it out on me.

23:06.318 --> 23:07.352
Jeez.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.791
Where's Hae-seong anyway?
I wonder why she's so late.

23:14.659 --> 23:16.094
Did you say something to her again?

23:17.596 --> 23:19.731
Am I responsible for everything
that goes wrong around here?

23:21.967 --> 23:25.670
The world is governed
by a number of immutable laws.

23:26.505 --> 23:31.076
If you hurt someone,
it comes back to you twofold.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.913
So stop harassing her,
or you'll suffer cosmic retribution.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.151
My goodness.

23:39.651 --> 23:41.219
What did I do to her?

23:42.154 --> 23:43.555
Seriously...

23:50.128 --> 23:51.263
Hey, you.

23:52.697 --> 23:54.599
Go and find Shin Hae-seong right now.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.370
I don't want to hear her yapping
all night long.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.989
What's bothering you now?

24:18.757 --> 24:20.292
What's up with this school?

24:21.593 --> 24:24.663
I know I'm a nutjob,
but so is everyone else here.

24:24.729 --> 24:26.798
Now, now. Mind your language.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.135
Why aren't we allowed to use cell phones?

24:31.002 --> 24:32.504
What kind of stupid rule is that?

24:33.772 --> 24:35.607
Stop being so lame, Dad.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.611
I'll have to stop being lame
if Seul tells me so.

24:43.748 --> 24:44.616
And...

24:58.363 --> 24:59.498
You're so annoying.

25:29.861 --> 25:30.996
Who is it?

25:37.702 --> 25:40.839
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

25:45.744 --> 25:46.811
Is Hae-seong here?

25:50.949 --> 25:52.384
I have something to give her.

25:58.890 --> 25:59.791
What is this?

26:01.226 --> 26:02.861
FOR HAE-SEONG

26:10.936 --> 26:11.770
What is this?

26:13.371 --> 26:15.040
You're giving a song you wrote

26:16.041 --> 26:17.108
to Shin Hae-seong?

26:30.789 --> 26:31.723
Is she not here?

26:32.757 --> 26:34.225
She left last night

26:34.593 --> 26:36.695
because the girl in front of you
was bothering her no end.

26:48.473 --> 26:49.341
Hey!

27:00.952 --> 27:01.987
Hey, Hae-seong.

27:05.957 --> 27:06.891
Shin Hae-seong!

27:07.959 --> 27:09.194
Isn't that a friend of yours?

27:10.261 --> 27:11.196
Let's go, Dad.

27:12.197 --> 27:13.164
You dummy.

27:13.732 --> 27:16.034
You should at least take this.

27:16.935 --> 27:18.003
You wanted it back.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.038
Let's just go, Dad.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.907
What did you do so wrong?
Why are you running away like this?

27:23.475 --> 27:24.909
Why are you being so dumb?

27:25.777 --> 27:28.747
-Dad, please. Let's go.
-All right.

27:30.415 --> 27:31.416
Listen to it.

27:34.352 --> 27:35.353
You have to.

27:36.054 --> 27:37.222
You really have to, okay?

27:41.426 --> 27:43.161
I don't mean everything I say.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.697
Filter some things out, you dope.

27:51.569 --> 27:53.471
He doesn't know when to stop.

27:54.439 --> 27:56.041
He's the real dummy.

27:57.575 --> 27:59.644
Does he like you?

28:00.812 --> 28:02.981
It's not like that, Dad.

28:20.131 --> 28:21.966
-The main stage is over there.
-I see.

28:24.836 --> 28:27.572
This is the student
I was telling you about.

28:28.907 --> 28:29.841
Jin Yu-jin?

28:31.376 --> 28:32.210
Nice to meet you.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.080
Who are you?

28:39.184 --> 28:42.687
You call yourself a musician?
This is Korea's top songwriter.

28:43.188 --> 28:45.590
-This is producer Shin Jae-in.
-I see.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.727
He listened to the songs
you wrote a while back.

28:49.527 --> 28:51.796
He wants to make you a star.

28:53.965 --> 28:55.300
Follow his guidance, okay?

28:56.167 --> 28:57.168
My songs?

28:58.303 --> 29:00.171
I don't let just anyone
listen to my songs.

29:00.772 --> 29:01.840
How did you listen to them?

29:05.310 --> 29:08.113
Right, the composition assignments?

29:08.747 --> 29:09.981
They're nothing.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.616
I just made them for fun.

29:11.683 --> 29:14.519
I'm sure you important men
have better things to do.

29:15.854 --> 29:16.855
I'm going to play

29:18.456 --> 29:21.059
the kind of music I want,

29:21.593 --> 29:24.863
so please just leave me alone.

29:30.568 --> 29:32.270
He really is something.

29:32.670 --> 29:33.671
Fascinating.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.777
He is a rebellious one.
Please train him well.

29:39.844 --> 29:40.912
I will.

29:41.913 --> 29:45.283
It's a lot more fun
to work with talented rebels

29:46.084 --> 29:49.921
than talentless but submissive types.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.503
I didn't know she would leave so quickly.

30:06.237 --> 30:08.540
There's something I have to give her.

30:10.408 --> 30:11.376
Is it something important?

30:13.511 --> 30:14.345
Yes.

30:19.517 --> 30:22.220
STUDENT RECORDS
NAME: SHIN HAE-SEONG

30:22.487 --> 30:24.289
Her hometown is Chungju.

30:25.356 --> 30:26.891
You can ship it express.

30:32.530 --> 30:33.464
Thank you.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.139
Where do you want to go?

30:43.274 --> 30:45.176
I like going to the zoo.

30:45.476 --> 30:46.444
The zoo?

30:50.148 --> 30:51.983
What's going on? Why are you here?

30:52.050 --> 30:52.884
What?

30:53.351 --> 30:54.185
Well...

30:55.386 --> 30:58.456
What about you?
Why did you hop into my car?

30:58.523 --> 31:00.425
Take me to the express bus terminal.

31:00.725 --> 31:01.559
Hurry.

31:04.963 --> 31:08.132
I didn't go all the way to the States
to get a license to be your chauffeur.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.401
This is urgent.

31:12.570 --> 31:13.905
"This is urgent."

31:34.559 --> 31:35.793
Why are you going there?

31:37.362 --> 31:38.396
What for?

31:39.330 --> 31:41.232
I won't ask about you two,

31:41.866 --> 31:44.469
so don't pry or get any wrong ideas.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.806
There's nothing going on between us.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.279
We just wanted to go for a drive.

31:55.346 --> 31:58.783
I needed a change of pace, so Si-u said
he would take me out for a drive.

32:02.353 --> 32:07.225
I know Si-u doesn't let
just anyone in his car.

32:13.398 --> 32:16.367
Yes, I do. You're in my car.

32:21.706 --> 32:25.009
This connection here
serves as the foundation.

32:25.076 --> 32:28.413
The chord tone and tension
comprise the chord sound.

32:28.846 --> 32:31.449
Including slightly
unusual cases like these,

32:31.516 --> 32:33.618
this note is...

32:33.685 --> 32:36.688
You must be bored
with no one to harass now.

32:37.555 --> 32:40.224
-Be quiet.
-Am I wrong?

32:40.458 --> 32:42.493
You didn't even let her sleep at night.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.529
Is it my fault she left?

32:45.029 --> 32:49.600
Then whose fault is it?
You turned everyone against her.

32:50.234 --> 32:52.270
It takes more than one person
to turn someone into a loner.

32:53.504 --> 32:55.206
What about you?

32:55.473 --> 32:58.743
What are you talking about?

32:58.810 --> 33:02.113
You know what? I'm her best friend.

33:03.047 --> 33:04.349
Come on.

33:04.749 --> 33:06.484
I can't focus because of all the noise.

33:08.086 --> 33:08.920
Ms. Ahn.

33:09.687 --> 33:10.722
Why don't we call it a day?

33:14.425 --> 33:15.259
What?

33:15.827 --> 33:16.661
Why?

33:17.061 --> 33:18.329
Are you not happy with the lecture?

33:18.496 --> 33:20.598
Why did Shin Hae-seong transfer?

33:21.232 --> 33:23.701
That's what everyone is
talking about right now.

33:24.202 --> 33:26.270
Are you going to continue teaching
when no one is listening?

33:26.904 --> 33:29.007
-Hey.
-She's right.

33:29.374 --> 33:32.343
We couldn't even say goodbye to Hae-seong,

33:32.410 --> 33:36.147
and yet you're not telling us anything.

33:36.381 --> 33:37.815
-Yes.
-Yes.

33:37.882 --> 33:39.217
-Why did she leave?
-What happened?

33:39.283 --> 33:41.019
-Why did she transfer?
-This isn't cool.

33:41.919 --> 33:43.554
Why did Hae-seong leave Kirin?

33:44.922 --> 33:47.992
Our friend suddenly took off
without even saying goodbye.

33:48.459 --> 33:50.194
If you were in our shoes,
would you just sit back?

33:51.662 --> 33:52.697
What happened?

33:53.598 --> 33:54.532
Well...

33:55.533 --> 33:57.402
You see...

34:09.013 --> 34:10.548
My dear friends,

34:12.050 --> 34:14.819
I couldn't bear to say goodbye in person,

34:15.520 --> 34:17.422
so I'm writing a letter.

34:19.490 --> 34:21.426
I'll never be able to forget

34:22.226 --> 34:24.028
the time I spent with you all.

34:25.630 --> 34:29.367
Park Hong-ju, who sang for me
whenever the going got tough,

34:30.468 --> 34:33.037
Ui-bong, Kirin's best dancing machine,

34:34.439 --> 34:37.241
Sun-dong, my lucky charm,

34:38.709 --> 34:44.382
and Yu-jin, who is so fickle,
but still loyal...

34:46.551 --> 34:47.418
It makes me sad

34:48.453 --> 34:53.091
that I won't be able to
listen to you sing in person.

34:54.959 --> 34:56.461
No matter how hard things were,

34:57.228 --> 35:02.433
hearing you guys sing
gave me the strength to go on.

35:04.035 --> 35:07.839
But I'm sure I'll see you on TV very soon

35:09.407 --> 35:11.242
because you're all great.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.879
While my dream ends here,

35:15.680 --> 35:17.915
you guys have to realize yours.

35:23.988 --> 35:24.989
Hong-ju, are you crying?

35:25.756 --> 35:26.824
Ui-bong, you too?

35:28.092 --> 35:29.894
What's up with everyone today?

35:30.661 --> 35:31.662
Yu-jin.

35:32.830 --> 35:34.966
Hae-seong wrote us a letter and left.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.301
I think she's gone for good.

35:41.439 --> 35:43.641
What are you doing?

35:46.878 --> 35:48.779
Shin Hae-seong's not transferring,

35:49.547 --> 35:50.481
so don't cry.

35:53.384 --> 35:54.385
The goal of today's show

35:55.953 --> 35:57.655
will be bringing Hae-seong back to school.

35:59.390 --> 36:01.292
She will come to watch our performance,

36:02.560 --> 36:05.763
so just focus on convincing her
to stay here.

36:06.864 --> 36:07.865
Are you sure...

36:09.300 --> 36:10.835
Hae-seong will come?

36:11.769 --> 36:12.837
Don't you trust me?

36:13.671 --> 36:14.505
So...

36:15.740 --> 36:18.075
all we have to do
is pull off a great show, right?

36:32.223 --> 36:33.191
What is it?

36:33.791 --> 36:37.161
-The day has come.
-What day?

36:37.495 --> 36:39.597
I put together a band.

36:39.664 --> 36:42.967
The name is Kirin Art School
Yang Jin-man's Road Band.

36:47.572 --> 36:48.739
It's just a street band.

36:49.774 --> 36:52.009
You shouldn't be narrow-minded.

36:52.076 --> 36:55.446
We're destined for greatness,
but we have to start somewhere,

36:55.513 --> 36:57.882
so we thought we could start
by performing on the streets.

36:59.283 --> 37:00.918
Why should I come to see this band?

37:01.319 --> 37:04.488
I whipped the kids into shape.

37:04.789 --> 37:07.391
They need more practice,
but they have the basics down.

37:07.458 --> 37:09.627
You'll be impressed
by the audience's reaction.

37:09.927 --> 37:11.329
And who was behind this project?

37:11.896 --> 37:12.897
Me.

37:16.467 --> 37:18.069
Mr. Yang, you're not a child.

37:18.636 --> 37:21.105
Yet why do you crave compliments?

37:23.574 --> 37:24.809
No. I mean...

37:25.343 --> 37:26.477
Once you see their performance,

37:27.945 --> 37:30.248
you may have no choice but to praise me...

37:30.548 --> 37:31.649
All right. I'll come.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.018
Really? You're coming?

37:36.053 --> 37:37.221
Thank you.

37:42.960 --> 37:46.731
I think Jin Yu-jin is the leader
of the band Mr. Yang formed.

37:48.399 --> 37:51.736
Then things might move along
more quickly than expected.

37:53.404 --> 37:54.238
Right.

38:10.154 --> 38:11.122
Hey, Rian.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.359
Are you having fun at school?

38:17.028 --> 38:18.062
It's all right.

38:19.330 --> 38:20.164
But...

38:21.632 --> 38:22.933
what are you doing here?

38:25.403 --> 38:29.507
I'm thinking of putting together
Korea's top idol group.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.943
I'm discussing details with Mr. Lee,

38:33.778 --> 38:36.180
but I'm planning to pick
super idols through an audition.

38:38.349 --> 38:39.850
From our school?

38:42.086 --> 38:43.020
Is that why...

38:44.021 --> 38:45.890
you were talking to Jin Yu-jin?

38:46.724 --> 38:47.992
Oh, him.

38:48.359 --> 38:49.627
He piqued my interest.

38:50.594 --> 38:53.831
He will be performing this evening,
so I'll go see if he has potential.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.134
What about HershE and I:dn?

38:58.502 --> 38:59.970
What will happen to us?

39:02.206 --> 39:03.808
That I don't know.

39:04.809 --> 39:06.277
But to me,

39:06.877 --> 39:09.513
you're just another candidate
for a super idol group.

39:16.387 --> 39:19.023
I will be performing tonight.

39:20.758 --> 39:23.027
Please keep an eye on me too.

39:24.795 --> 39:25.629
Really?

39:26.364 --> 39:27.565
Then I'll see what you're made of.

39:45.916 --> 39:47.918
Now that you're focusing
on this fried chicken joint,

39:48.719 --> 39:50.254
are you seeing more money?

39:50.621 --> 39:53.724
Get out of here. Don't you have school?

39:55.092 --> 39:57.962
Stop getting in the way
and please leave, dear customer.

40:00.998 --> 40:02.533
Why did you pick me?

40:04.402 --> 40:05.236
What?

40:06.670 --> 40:10.107
Why did you pick me
if you were just going to abandon me?

40:11.609 --> 40:14.078
What kind of principal doesn't
take responsibility for his own student?

40:15.312 --> 40:18.015
What nonsense is this? What do you want?

40:18.315 --> 40:21.152
Students are abandoning the school
because teachers are abandoning them.

40:22.086 --> 40:24.188
You're driving me up the wall.

40:26.557 --> 40:27.691
What are you talking about?

40:28.459 --> 40:30.027
LET'S GATHER! LET'S PARTY!

40:32.696 --> 40:33.531
What is this?

40:41.205 --> 40:42.373
If you don't come tonight,

40:43.207 --> 40:44.542
I will quit school.

40:48.145 --> 40:50.281
It's not like you've been
going to that school for me.

40:51.215 --> 40:53.017
Let's set things straight.

40:53.083 --> 40:56.487
You've been babbling about
how I abandoned the school,

40:57.521 --> 40:58.856
but I was actually fired.

41:01.392 --> 41:02.760
I warned you.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.261
The show is at 6:00 p.m.

41:08.265 --> 41:09.600
I'm not the principal anymore.

41:10.935 --> 41:12.002
That brat.

41:12.970 --> 41:13.971
Gosh.

41:15.272 --> 41:16.273
What a weirdo.

41:20.744 --> 41:21.712
Goodness.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.991
Unbelievable.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.729
What now?

41:41.799 --> 41:43.334
Hello.

41:45.069 --> 41:46.670
What brings you here, Ms. Ahn?

41:50.040 --> 41:51.075
I...

41:52.076 --> 41:54.111
I think I messed up, Principal Ju.

41:56.981 --> 41:58.315
Hae-seong...

41:59.183 --> 42:01.719
is leaving Kirin because of me.

42:13.764 --> 42:17.735
I got jealous of Ms. Hyeon
for taking care of my students.

42:18.402 --> 42:20.671
I just thought I should be the one
scolding my students, not her.

42:21.505 --> 42:22.640
You know what I mean, right?

42:24.041 --> 42:26.043
Yes. Go on.

42:26.443 --> 42:27.278
So...

42:28.412 --> 42:30.347
I tried to be like Ms. Hyeon.

42:30.714 --> 42:32.049
I was really harsh.

42:33.017 --> 42:34.952
And it was in front of Hae-seong's father.

42:36.420 --> 42:39.390
Her father suddenly said
he would take her out of Kirin.

42:40.124 --> 42:43.127
I really didn't know that would happen.

42:43.494 --> 42:45.462
I was just trying to do my best.

42:47.164 --> 42:49.600
And I had no one else to talk to.

42:52.703 --> 42:53.571
Did I...

42:54.638 --> 42:57.074
ruin a student's life?

42:58.742 --> 43:01.979
Why did you do something
so out of character?

43:02.813 --> 43:04.181
My gosh.

43:05.082 --> 43:07.618
I'm not the principal anymore.
What do you expect me to do?

43:09.420 --> 43:10.621
Where is Hae-seong right now?

43:16.694 --> 43:18.329
Isn't Hae-seong from Chungju?

43:32.343 --> 43:33.577
SEOUL BUS TERMINAL SCHEDULE

43:33.644 --> 43:36.013
How will you find Hae-seong
in this huge crowd?

43:36.580 --> 43:39.650
She's pretty tall. Look for tall girls.

43:40.217 --> 43:41.385
Where is she from again?

43:41.452 --> 43:43.120
Chungju? Cheongju?

43:43.387 --> 43:44.221
Chungju.

44:08.612 --> 44:10.047
What's there to listen to?

44:10.614 --> 44:11.749
It's just my singing.

44:18.389 --> 44:20.324
The bus is here. Let's go.

44:41.912 --> 44:42.813
Let's talk.

44:44.581 --> 44:45.616
Who are you?

44:48.485 --> 44:49.920
Nice to meet you, Mr. Shin.

44:50.421 --> 44:52.222
I'm Hae-seong's friend, JB.

44:55.659 --> 44:57.094
Are you that JB?

44:57.828 --> 44:59.396
Hae-seong's boyfriend?

45:02.599 --> 45:03.901
-Boyfriend?
-Dad.

45:04.435 --> 45:06.437
He's just a friend.

45:07.204 --> 45:08.806
A friend who is also a boy.

45:12.776 --> 45:14.978
I came to give you this.

45:24.655 --> 45:28.859
If you're here to take her back
to that school, it's too late.

45:29.860 --> 45:32.763
Don't make her second-guess her decision.

45:35.365 --> 45:37.901
I want to attend school with her.

45:39.036 --> 45:40.704
Hae-seong will improve,

45:41.872 --> 45:45.209
so please let her keep studying music.

45:46.009 --> 45:49.947
You may say she will improve
since you're her boyfriend,

45:50.647 --> 45:53.584
but if she had talent,

45:54.551 --> 45:56.520
she would've gotten somewhere
in the past three years.

45:57.788 --> 46:01.191
Her teacher had me come over,
and said that she had no talent

46:01.625 --> 46:03.093
and that I should take her home.

46:05.729 --> 46:08.699
I'm so sorry I said that.

46:12.536 --> 46:14.738
I'm here to apologize.

46:15.739 --> 46:17.908
I made a mistake.

46:21.378 --> 46:24.581
Sir, why don't we talk?

46:33.757 --> 46:35.425
We received a complaint.
Please show us your ID.

46:44.935 --> 46:47.504
Do you control the police as well?

46:50.607 --> 46:52.476
You know what you need to do, right?

46:52.810 --> 46:55.012
Yes. I'll be right back.

47:05.289 --> 47:06.990
Is he dumb or just gullible?

47:08.358 --> 47:10.360
I called the police for a noise complaint.

47:10.427 --> 47:12.229
"Control the police"?

47:13.263 --> 47:16.767
He takes orders well
because he's gullible.

47:18.235 --> 47:19.403
It makes him cute.

47:23.207 --> 47:24.608
Who said that?

47:24.675 --> 47:26.510
Aren't you guys ready for it?

47:31.348 --> 47:33.283
If you were going to try
to bring her back to Kirin,

47:34.017 --> 47:36.486
you should never have hurt her
in the first place.

47:37.020 --> 47:38.822
You're right, Mr. Shin.

47:39.623 --> 47:40.524
We're so sorry.

47:40.591 --> 47:42.993
Hae-seong's only 19 years old.

47:43.060 --> 47:47.431
She has more than enough time
to discover her musical talent.

47:47.798 --> 47:49.533
-Talent?
-Yes.

47:51.034 --> 47:54.972
It makes no difference to me
whether she's talented or not.

47:56.473 --> 48:00.878
I didn't send her to Kirin
thinking she would become a singer.

48:01.545 --> 48:02.379
Pardon?

48:02.913 --> 48:05.616
I only let her do it

48:06.350 --> 48:07.751
because it's what she wanted so badly.

48:09.253 --> 48:12.589
I wanted her to give it a shot
even if she ends up having to give it up.

48:14.958 --> 48:15.792
Dad.

48:17.594 --> 48:19.429
But all throughout her three years
at Kirin,

48:21.265 --> 48:22.299
she never came home

48:24.067 --> 48:26.570
happy and excited.

48:28.605 --> 48:31.308
She always came home dejected and unsure.

48:34.211 --> 48:35.245
Regardless,

48:36.647 --> 48:38.315
she practiced singing every night.

48:39.116 --> 48:40.817
She was so determined to become a singer.

48:44.922 --> 48:47.124
If you knew how much
Hae-seong wanted to sing,

48:47.858 --> 48:48.859
you wouldn't have said

48:50.060 --> 48:52.029
such hurtful things to her.

48:53.997 --> 48:55.666
You were so callous
when I was sitting there,

48:57.234 --> 49:00.437
so I can only imagine how awful you were
to her over the past three years.

49:01.905 --> 49:02.839
That's not true, sir.

49:03.373 --> 49:05.309
Why don't you look at it this way?

49:06.443 --> 49:10.747
We had not been able to recognize
Hae-seong's talent until now.

49:13.250 --> 49:15.719
-You weren't able to recognize her talent?
-Right.

49:23.827 --> 49:24.661
Mr. Shin.

49:25.262 --> 49:26.229
Mr. Shin.

49:34.071 --> 49:36.306
Stand here and sing.

49:37.474 --> 49:38.342
What?

49:39.209 --> 49:40.077
Mr. Shin.

49:41.111 --> 49:42.379
If even a single person

49:44.081 --> 49:47.351
recognizes your singing talent,

49:48.652 --> 49:50.187
then I'll concede.

49:51.288 --> 49:52.756
Come on, Mr. Shin.

49:52.823 --> 49:55.092
This isn't right. Please don't.

49:55.392 --> 49:56.560
Go ahead and sing.

51:33.323 --> 51:34.758
Why are you crying?

51:36.626 --> 51:37.894
Aren't you mad?

51:41.898 --> 51:45.635
All that hard work
hasn't amounted to anything.

51:46.002 --> 51:47.170
Are you really okay with that?

51:50.841 --> 51:51.808
Do you really think

51:53.577 --> 51:55.278
I don't want you to become a singer?

51:58.081 --> 52:01.318
I want you to realize your dream
more than anyone else out there.

52:07.491 --> 52:08.625
Let's go home.

52:10.794 --> 52:11.928
We've had enough.

52:24.774 --> 52:25.775
This place is great.

52:26.176 --> 52:27.777
-It's so spacious.
-It really is.

52:29.246 --> 52:30.080
Mr. Yang.

52:31.081 --> 52:34.284
-You're quite something.
-This is nothing.

52:35.418 --> 52:36.653
This will be broadcasted.

52:38.421 --> 52:40.891
-I'm not doing it.
-Why not?

52:40.957 --> 52:42.425
What's up with you?

52:42.859 --> 52:44.027
This is a great chance.

52:44.661 --> 52:45.562
That's right.

52:45.629 --> 52:48.231
We've always dreamed of performing on-air.

52:48.532 --> 52:50.500
Maybe you have, but not me.

52:51.668 --> 52:53.503
This was supposed to be for Hae-seong.

52:54.504 --> 52:56.907
If we perform here, Hae-seong can't come.

52:58.141 --> 52:59.643
Maybe she will listen to it on the radio.

53:00.043 --> 53:04.281
That will leave a bigger impact on her
than watching straight from here.

53:05.882 --> 53:10.220
Plus, this show is also for Principal Ju.

53:10.487 --> 53:13.390
You said you had invited him, right?

53:13.456 --> 53:14.391
Right.

53:14.457 --> 53:18.461
Let's put on a great show for him
so that he comes back to Kirin.

53:18.895 --> 53:22.098
I went through a lot
to get you this venue.

53:22.399 --> 53:24.534
Your bandmates have dreamed
of performing live on-air.

53:24.601 --> 53:26.236
Why are you so selfish?

53:30.373 --> 53:32.342
Okay, I'll do it.

53:34.778 --> 53:35.679
Oh, right.

53:36.046 --> 53:37.414
Does anyone have Principal Ju's number?

53:38.081 --> 53:39.683
We need to tell him the venue changed.

53:39.916 --> 53:40.817
I have his number.

53:41.184 --> 53:42.986
I'll text him. Let's do a final rehearsal.

53:44.054 --> 53:44.888
Okay.

53:49.793 --> 53:53.029
Principal Ju, the venue has been changed
to KBC Radio Hall.

53:53.563 --> 53:54.431
You have to come.

53:54.931 --> 53:57.133
If you don't, I'm really quitting school.

54:03.740 --> 54:05.575
HUG THE RADIO LIVE BROADCAST
AT KBC RADIO HALL

54:10.480 --> 54:12.148
We'll do that as the encore song,

54:13.216 --> 54:14.551
so each of you, practice on your own.

54:17.153 --> 54:18.989
What is this? I've never seen it before.

54:30.066 --> 54:31.601
I came because I was worried about you.

54:32.802 --> 54:34.504
You don't have a vocalist in your band.

54:35.672 --> 54:37.173
I'm your temporary member, did you forget?

54:39.309 --> 54:42.479
Yu-jin texted me
about the change of venue.

54:46.449 --> 54:49.619
Gosh, why is she pretending to be friendly
all of a sudden?

55:00.597 --> 55:01.965
Hae-seong wrote this.

55:03.133 --> 55:06.569
I arranged it slightly
for our band to play it.

55:13.243 --> 55:14.077
What is this?

55:15.578 --> 55:17.247
You're giving a song you wrote

55:17.781 --> 55:18.815
to Shin Hae-seong?

55:58.888 --> 56:00.256
-You're here.
-Yes.

56:00.924 --> 56:04.160
You won't regret coming.
The kids worked very hard.

56:04.427 --> 56:05.428
I see.

56:30.820 --> 56:31.654
Dummy.

56:32.555 --> 56:33.790
You're a good piano player.

56:36.326 --> 56:39.262
I realized that your song is good
after listening to it for the second time.

56:39.929 --> 56:40.897
It's really good.

56:42.298 --> 56:45.135
We're performing your song
at six o'clock tonight.

56:46.369 --> 56:48.438
You have to come. Come and sing it.

56:49.806 --> 56:50.874
It's your song after all.

56:51.775 --> 56:52.709
I'll be waiting for you.

56:58.982 --> 57:02.419
It's an unusual name for a band.
Spirit of Kirin Art School?

57:03.486 --> 57:04.320
Yes.

57:04.888 --> 57:09.459
A childhood idol of mine
taught me what the spirit of rock is.

57:11.461 --> 57:12.695
He said, "Rock is rebellion.

57:13.229 --> 57:15.665
You need to make your voice heard.
There's no need to be discouraged."

57:20.870 --> 57:21.971
To me,

57:23.106 --> 57:25.375
Kirin Art School once was
the very spirit of rock.

57:29.612 --> 57:31.080
That's because my childhood idol

57:32.849 --> 57:34.984
was Principal Ju Jeong-wan.

57:36.619 --> 57:39.622
The leader of the band Galaxy?

57:40.390 --> 57:41.224
Yes.

57:42.459 --> 57:45.495
Why is he overdoing it?
Like he ever respected me.

57:45.895 --> 57:47.697
But he betrayed me.

57:48.431 --> 57:49.265
No.

57:50.133 --> 57:52.402
He betrayed all of us and left Kirin

57:55.505 --> 57:58.374
because a big entertainment agency
took over our school.

58:01.678 --> 58:04.380
What used to be a place
of freedom and dreams

58:05.181 --> 58:07.183
became a training ground
for cookie-cutter singers.

58:07.650 --> 58:11.120
He just watched our dreams
being crushed by rules and regulations,

58:12.589 --> 58:15.925
and he let existing students
be pushed to the sidelines

58:17.026 --> 58:18.895
by idol group members
who transferred to Kirin.

58:20.763 --> 58:22.866
He's a bit rough around the edges.

58:23.733 --> 58:25.768
He's merely expressing

58:26.636 --> 58:28.238
his love for Principal Ju.

58:32.642 --> 58:35.245
Rian of HershE. It's been a long time.

58:35.311 --> 58:36.679
How have you been?

58:36.913 --> 58:38.448
-Is that Rian?
-It's Rian.

58:38.515 --> 58:39.582
Is that really Rian?

58:40.016 --> 58:43.419
As you can see,
I'm having a great time at school.

58:43.753 --> 58:46.789
Learning songwriting, for one thing.

58:47.824 --> 58:50.460
How can she just lie through her teeth?

58:50.527 --> 58:52.495
Songwriting? That's great.

58:52.862 --> 58:54.731
Could we hear one of your songs here?

58:57.600 --> 58:59.369
-Rian!
-Rian!

58:59.602 --> 59:06.276
-Rian!
-Rian!

59:36.205 --> 59:38.141
Wait, isn't this Rian's voice?

59:38.474 --> 59:42.078
I think tonight's show has turned into
a radio show live broadcast.

59:42.645 --> 59:45.181
Rian is writing songs?
That was unexpected.

59:46.282 --> 59:47.116
That's...

59:48.284 --> 59:49.352
Hae-seong's song.

1:00:41.137 --> 1:00:42.138
Play.

1:00:43.239 --> 1:00:44.307
Just play.

1:00:44.707 --> 1:00:45.541
Come on.

1:01:03.826 --> 1:01:04.661
This...

1:01:05.728 --> 1:01:06.763
This is my song.

1:01:08.364 --> 1:01:09.999
I wrote this.

1:02:13.596 --> 1:02:16.065
Hey, it's JB!

1:02:27.243 --> 1:02:30.146
-Look. It's JB!
-It's JB!

1:02:35.318 --> 1:02:37.153
What's going on?
Why is he taking the stage?

1:02:38.121 --> 1:02:39.288
What's going on?

1:02:56.205 --> 1:02:57.039
You are

1:02:58.207 --> 1:02:59.108
the real screwup.

1:03:31.374 --> 1:03:33.576
Let go of me. People are watching!

1:03:33.876 --> 1:03:36.279
You've never stooped this low.

1:03:36.813 --> 1:03:37.947
Let go of me.

1:03:38.614 --> 1:03:39.448
Tell me.

1:03:40.082 --> 1:03:41.117
Why did you do it?

1:03:42.552 --> 1:03:45.388
-Do what?
-You knew it was Hae-seong's.

1:03:45.988 --> 1:03:47.657
Did you do it on purpose,

1:03:48.691 --> 1:03:50.259
knowing full well
I'm interested in the song?

1:03:51.694 --> 1:03:53.729
Did you have to take
even the last little thing from her?

1:03:55.064 --> 1:03:57.333
Are you implying that I stole her song

1:03:59.368 --> 1:04:01.103
because I'm jealous of her
for being close to you?

1:04:03.506 --> 1:04:05.174
Don't you think that's childish?

1:04:05.241 --> 1:04:06.542
That's not what I was implying.

1:04:08.411 --> 1:04:10.780
She has nothing but her love for music.

1:04:11.848 --> 1:04:14.050
But you took even that little ray of hope
from her.

1:04:16.118 --> 1:04:18.020
Do you have any idea how cruel you are?

1:04:20.890 --> 1:04:21.958
I'm cruel?

1:04:23.593 --> 1:04:24.527
Hope?

1:04:25.761 --> 1:04:28.631
I don't have the wherewithal
to worry about other people.

1:04:28.764 --> 1:04:30.199
Put yourself in her shoes.

1:04:31.901 --> 1:04:35.504
You know very well how it feels
to have what's yours taken away.

1:04:35.571 --> 1:04:37.206
I know. I know all too well...

1:04:40.543 --> 1:04:42.578
that you need to take from others
or have yours taken away.

1:04:45.214 --> 1:04:46.649
I did nothing wrong.

1:04:47.016 --> 1:04:49.051
As a star,

1:04:49.952 --> 1:04:51.320
you're shining brightly enough already.

1:04:51.821 --> 1:04:52.655
No.

1:04:54.090 --> 1:04:55.758
No matter how big a star I am,

1:04:57.293 --> 1:04:59.061
people will forget me
if I'm out of the limelight.

1:05:02.465 --> 1:05:03.666
You know what?

1:05:04.967 --> 1:05:06.202
Mr. Lee...

1:05:07.770 --> 1:05:09.305
is putting together a new group.

1:05:10.907 --> 1:05:12.208
It looks as if

1:05:13.175 --> 1:05:15.044
he'll pick Jin Yu-jin over you.

1:05:17.847 --> 1:05:19.081
I'm not like you.

1:05:20.783 --> 1:05:22.718
I won't let anyone take what's mine.

1:06:27.550 --> 1:06:28.517
Are you okay?

1:06:28.584 --> 1:06:30.319
The ship has sailed.

1:06:30.953 --> 1:06:34.223
It's like I've graduated
and gotten my diploma.

1:06:34.523 --> 1:06:36.993
What is this?
You never discussed any of it with me.

1:06:37.059 --> 1:06:40.863
We're making Kirin's super idol,
Jin Yu-jin, into Korea's top star.

1:06:41.130 --> 1:06:43.933
But the one who stole the show
last night wasn't Jin Yu-jin. It was me.

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:46.869
You've never once proven yourself
with your talent.

1:06:47.303 --> 1:06:49.005
Don't you have respect
for other people's things?

1:06:49.071 --> 1:06:50.139
So you're jealous of me too?

1:06:50.206 --> 1:06:52.174
How can you cause someone so much grief?

1:06:52.241 --> 1:06:53.209
Do you like her?

1:06:53.709 --> 1:06:54.543
I like you.

1:06:55.511 --> 1:06:56.345
What?
