-CHANDLER: That him?
-BOSCH: That's him.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.778
Terry Spencer.

00:27.820 --> 00:30.156
-How'd you find it?
-Uh, Hector found it,

00:30.197 --> 00:31.782
under her maiden name.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.284
She's owned it for a long time.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.870
Well before she married Cronyn.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.335
-Shall we ring the bell?
-I imagine he's been instructed

00:43.377 --> 00:44.879
not to answer the door.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.672
Mm-hmm.

00:53.345 --> 00:56.348
(car alarm ringing,
horn honking)

01:04.398 --> 01:05.983
CHANDLER:

Kathy told me you might try
something before the hearing.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.474
Kathy Zelden? Mrs. Cronyn?

02:20.516 --> 02:23.102
Why does a property room clerk
need a lawyer at all?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.562
I don't have to talk to you.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.480
Look, we know about your debts,

02:26.522 --> 02:28.482
how the Cronyns used
your financial predicament

02:28.524 --> 02:29.817
to leverage you.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.485
How Olmer's DNA
got on that handkerchief,

02:31.527 --> 02:32.820
how you switched it
with the original.

02:32.862 --> 02:34.530
I would never do anything
like that.

02:34.572 --> 02:36.574
Hey. Your signature
is on the seal.

02:36.615 --> 02:39.118
Ask yourself:
who has the most exposure

02:39.159 --> 02:40.744
when we blow this up
at the hearing?

02:40.786 --> 02:42.079
CHANDLER:
Not the Cronyns.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.206
The Cronyns represent Borders,
not you.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.833
BOSCH:
They played you
for a patsy, pal.

02:45.875 --> 02:48.002
We don't want you, Terry.
We want Cronyn.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.420
And we want to keep
a serial killer

02:49.461 --> 02:51.046
locked up inside his cage.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.464
They preyed on your desperation,

02:52.506 --> 02:54.550
now they're counting
on your silence.

02:54.592 --> 02:57.052
Help us, we'll help you.

02:59.471 --> 03:02.308
(engine starts)

03:02.349 --> 03:04.894
Why'd you kill the pharmacist?

03:04.935 --> 03:07.354
That was Stones.

03:07.396 --> 03:08.981
We have video.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.816
I can play it for you
if you want.

03:10.858 --> 03:15.321
That dude was already dead.
I just shot him to play along.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.989
Why'd Stones kill him?

03:17.031 --> 03:18.449
Send a message.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.867
Which was?

03:19.909 --> 03:21.410
Don't rat.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.454
Hmm.

03:24.997 --> 03:27.374
Who gave the order?

03:27.416 --> 03:29.418
(laughs softly)

03:29.460 --> 03:31.712
Walsh.

03:31.754 --> 03:34.131
And where's Walsh?

03:34.173 --> 03:35.966
Who knows?

03:36.008 --> 03:37.801
I thought you might.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.304
We'll come back to that.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.182
Who killed Charles Fagan?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.642
Who?

03:44.683 --> 03:47.394
The guy you carjacked
after the pharmacy hit.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.479
Stones.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.105
Stones is dead.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.982
R.I.P., motherfucker.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.943
Who killed Oscar Piñeto?

03:53.984 --> 03:55.361
I don't know who that is.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.572
This is your idea
of a full cooperation?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.577
(whispers indistinctly)

04:07.331 --> 04:10.125
(sighs)

04:10.167 --> 04:13.712
I know where there's
another body.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.781
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:40.823 --> 04:41.949
PIERCE:
What do you got?

04:41.991 --> 04:44.618
-That.
-Somebody call it in?

04:44.660 --> 04:45.995
MORGAN:
Anonymous tip.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.413
VEGA:
Why us and not the bomb squad?

04:47.454 --> 04:49.456
It's oozing blood.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.917
And it smells bad.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.027
-(exhales)
-Ugh.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.866
-Adult?
-Looks like.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.493
-VEGA: One person?
-PIERCE:
Hope it's not a mix and match.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.912
-Male or female?
-Kind of burly...

05:28.954 --> 05:31.957
Shaved legs. Toenail polish.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.584
Not dispositive.

05:33.625 --> 05:37.129
I don't know.
Without the pelvic girdle...

05:39.798 --> 05:42.301
-You're there tomorrow, right?
-Not if I have to wear a tie.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.887
-You even own a tie?
-Trashed 'em all when I retired.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.889
Just not a Hawaiian shirt.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.515
Clean T and sport coat?

05:48.557 --> 05:50.768
Jesus. Read my memo?

05:50.809 --> 05:51.769
Glanced at it.

05:51.810 --> 05:52.811
Comments by end of day.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.313
Counting your chickens?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.190
Playing the odds, brother,
playing the odds.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.233
With house money.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.236
Am I whining?

06:01.278 --> 06:02.905
No, not at all.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.324
I'm just having
a really hard time with this.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.409
Uh, it's understandable.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.578
It's been a year.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.789
-More.
-Well, it's not that long.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.792
Plus, I'm sure you're stressed
about your dad's hearing.

06:14.833 --> 06:18.003
Not really. Why?

06:18.045 --> 06:21.048
I don't know. I would be.

06:21.090 --> 06:23.592
Not so much.

06:23.634 --> 06:25.219
You going?

06:25.260 --> 06:27.346
Of course. You?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.889
Yeah. I have to.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.936
-You started to say...
-Her birthday's coming up.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.063
Anniversary Effect?

06:37.106 --> 06:39.149
Maybe that's it.

06:39.191 --> 06:42.277
Look, you should
take the day off.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.905
Just to think about your mom.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.490
Just celebrate her.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.494
You ever been to Catalina?

06:50.536 --> 06:52.079
No.

06:52.121 --> 06:53.622
It's better
than the grunion run.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.998
(Galligan chuckles)

06:55.040 --> 06:57.751
Nothing's better
than the grunion run.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.506
BILLETS:
Don.

07:02.548 --> 07:05.175
Hey, Grace.
This thing takes forever.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.719
-Yeah, but so worth it, right?
-Right.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.139
-Look, I wanted to ask you...
-What?

07:10.180 --> 07:12.599
Any interest in reviewing
the quarterly stats?

07:12.641 --> 07:14.560
Why?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.562
I think they're a little rosy.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.148
-In some areas.
-Like?

07:19.189 --> 07:22.860
Burglaries, assaults,
robberies, BFMVs.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.904
-All down.
-Are they really?

07:25.946 --> 07:30.701
Or are we just bumping marginal
felonies to misdemeanors?

07:30.742 --> 07:32.536
I trust our people, don't you?

07:32.578 --> 07:34.955
Yeah-- but if they were feeling
pressure from above...

07:34.997 --> 07:36.540
Not from me they're not.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.333
-...to shade their reporting...
-Now, look.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.419
I'm comfortable
with the numbers, Grace.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.045
Mm.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.089
-Just thought I'd ask.
-Mm-hmm.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.717
Oh...

07:46.758 --> 07:50.512
Gack. God, pure gack.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.223
Might as well just drink
straight stomach acid.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.267
Cut out the middleman.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.952
♪ ♪

08:38.310 --> 08:39.686
Hey.

08:39.728 --> 08:42.231
-Oh, hey.
-Got something for me?

08:42.272 --> 08:43.357
Left it on your desk.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.442
Ah, thanks.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.487
Anything interesting?

08:48.528 --> 08:51.031
Eh, just budget stuff.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.660
See you later.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.912
Yeah. Hope so.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.092
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

09:20.560 --> 09:21.770
Bo Jonas.

09:24.690 --> 09:27.067
(turns off vacuum)

09:27.109 --> 09:30.320
Gary said these detectives
wanted to talk to me,

09:30.362 --> 09:31.947
so I went.

09:31.989 --> 09:34.241
What happened?

09:34.283 --> 09:37.077
They didn't show.

09:37.119 --> 09:40.080
They said you didn't show.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.915
-You and Gary.
-No, man.

09:41.957 --> 09:44.459
We're waiting, they're late.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.837
I'm getting a bad feeling
in my gut.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.089
Then these two Jakes roll up.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.800
-Jamaicans?
-Mm-hmm. Gangsters.

09:51.842 --> 09:55.512
It was a trap, and I ran, man.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.597
Gary didn't.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.518
You knew them? The Jamaicans?

10:01.560 --> 10:05.272
Recognized them. Sold me a gun.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.316
You still got it?

10:07.357 --> 10:09.109
Gave it to Gary to hold.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.778
Felt like a trap how?

10:11.820 --> 10:14.197
Like they knew
we was gonna be there.

10:14.239 --> 10:17.367
Ah, they, they was gunning
for us, no doubt.

10:19.036 --> 10:22.914
These Jamaicans,
could you identify them?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.833
Could.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.293
But you won't.

10:26.335 --> 10:29.212
Nope.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.341
(clears throat)

10:32.382 --> 10:34.593
(chuckles)

10:34.634 --> 10:37.054
-Detective Moore.
-Sergeant Mankiewicz.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.181
What can I do for you?

10:39.222 --> 10:41.475
You can save the date.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.101
Huh.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.644
He's finally gonna pull the pin.

10:44.686 --> 10:45.645
Mm-hmm.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.397
It's the end of an era.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.815
I wouldn't miss it.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.610
You know, we're asking everyone
to, uh, kick in.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.487
Oh. Enough said.

10:53.528 --> 10:56.198
-Double sawbuck, if you got it.
-I'll do better than that.

10:56.239 --> 11:00.452
Oops. Ha.
Just saw a moth fly out.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.120
I meant to hit the ATM
on the way in.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.663
Sorry. Circle back?

11:03.705 --> 11:05.499
Making a mental note.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.542
That's the best kind.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.555
Twice in one day.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.601
Would you like something?

11:24.643 --> 11:26.645
Oh, a coffee, black.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.358
What's up?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.693
Tell me about you
and Christina Henry. Your side.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.487
What's her beef?

11:35.529 --> 11:37.572
Think she had something to do
with the Times article?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.991
Well, I certainly think
she has it in for you.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.953
I'd like to know the full story.

11:42.994 --> 11:45.497
We were involved. Didn't last.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.082
Hard feelings?

11:47.124 --> 11:49.376
For a while. That passed.

11:49.418 --> 11:51.211
Least I thought it did.

11:51.253 --> 11:54.714
She came up for a promotion,
asked me to put in a good word.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.217
It didn't come through,
she blamed me.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.885
More than that,
said I didn't support her,

11:58.927 --> 12:01.680
bad-mouthed her,
ruined her career.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.808
-Did you?
-Ruin her career?

12:04.850 --> 12:06.226
Put in a good word.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.311
Kept my mouth shut.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.981
Asked my opinion
about Detective Henry's work,

12:11.022 --> 12:13.650
I recused myself
for obvious reasons.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.652
Hmm.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.238
I told you personal
could be useful.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.073
I got a text this morning
from someone

12:20.115 --> 12:22.868
in the D.A.'s office.
A memo from Henry...

12:24.870 --> 12:26.037
A leaked memo.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.124
Urging the D.A.
to open an investigation

12:29.166 --> 12:31.668
after the hearing
into police misconduct,

12:31.710 --> 12:33.378
yours in particular.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.422
Who's your source?

12:35.464 --> 12:37.090
Ah, you know I can't
tell you that.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.758
Trustworthy?

12:38.800 --> 12:40.760
Impeccable.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.057
Juan, ¿cómo está?

12:47.601 --> 12:49.978
Captain?

12:51.021 --> 12:54.107
Lieutenant. Come in.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.239
HINES (on monitor):
Given those realities,

13:01.281 --> 13:03.074
I've concluded that
it's fruitless to pursue

13:03.116 --> 13:04.993
a criminal prosecution
in this matter.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.329

file charges

a thorough investigation

13:14.461 --> 13:16.296
into Officer Robson's conduct

13:16.338 --> 13:19.591
before, during,
and after the incident.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.676
No comment yet from LAPD

13:21.718 --> 13:23.345

announcement.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.393

13:30.435 --> 13:32.562

You know who tells
the best version? Barrel.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.367
-Yeah. (chuckles)
-He can go on for half an hour.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.202
Oh, yeah, he's the master.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.412
What's this I hear
about a retirement party?

13:49.454 --> 13:52.040
Well, my understanding,
an intimate gathering,

13:52.082 --> 13:54.167
-detectives only.
-Of course.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.503
Still, shouldn't we
get him a gift?

13:56.545 --> 13:59.214
-Acknowledge his stellar career.
-No, that's a thought.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.299
-Don?
-Well, it's a nice gesture.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.969
Uh, happy to chip in.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.929

Hart says he's the driver.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.782
We pulled a print
from one of their rides.

14:25.824 --> 14:29.744
A career car thief
named Brandon Cleek.

Who shot him?

14:30.996 --> 14:32.330
Hart says Stones.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.375
Yeah, he would. Believe him?

14:35.417 --> 14:37.711
Think they both did it.

14:37.752 --> 14:42.090
We recover any usable forensics,
we'll let you know.

Gone?

15:10.702 --> 15:13.747
Poor choice of words. She split.

15:13.788 --> 15:17.292
Walked out of here
sometime this afternoon.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.836

Why don't you come up,
Ms. Chandler?

22:00.737 --> 22:03.281
Your Honor,
this motion has no merit.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.075
It's a publicity stunt
at the expense of my client.

22:06.117 --> 22:09.495
Ms. Chandler, I assume
you have a response to that.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.206
I do, Your Honor.
For the record, Honey Chandler,

22:12.248 --> 22:15.460
representing
Detective Hieronymus Bosch.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.129
My client has become aware
of the petition

22:18.171 --> 22:21.591
filed by Mr. Cronyn and
supported by the D.A.'s office

22:21.632 --> 22:24.761
alleging that Detective Bosch
falsified material evidence

22:24.802 --> 22:26.971
used to convict Mr. Borders.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.307
Somehow, these unfounded
allegations have made their way

22:29.348 --> 22:30.892
into the L.A. Times,

22:30.933 --> 22:33.061
-damaging his reputation.
-Ms. Chandler,

22:33.102 --> 22:34.937
we don't have all day;
make your argument.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.022
CHANDLER:
Of course, Your Honor.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.524
My client denies
the allegations.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.401
I have filed a motion
for leave to intervene

22:40.443 --> 22:41.944
so that he may answer them.

22:41.986 --> 22:45.782
Ms. Chandler, both Mr. Kennedy
and Mr. Cronyn object

22:45.823 --> 22:48.743
to your client's standing
in the matter.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.620
Your Honor,
these allegations implicate

22:50.661 --> 22:53.623
my client's property rights
and reputation and good name.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.583
I believe he has standing
to intervene

22:55.625 --> 22:56.876
and defend those rights.

22:56.918 --> 22:59.378
Your Honor, the people
can't be held responsible

22:59.420 --> 23:00.838
for an article in a newspaper

23:00.880 --> 23:02.507
that my office had
nothing to do with.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.551
Mr. Kennedy, Detective Bosch's
property rights

23:05.593 --> 23:08.096
and his good name and reputation
is an interest

23:08.137 --> 23:10.473
that he's entitled to protect.

23:10.515 --> 23:13.935
I therefore grant the motion
for leave to intervene.

23:13.976 --> 23:17.188
Ms. Chandler, you can call
your first witness.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.648
KENNEDY:
Your Honor, this is unfair.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.192
We're not prepared
for new witnesses.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.820
The people request that
we carry this over 30 days

23:23.861 --> 23:25.446
in order to seek depositions

23:25.488 --> 23:27.532
and properly prepare
for a new hearing.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.159
Your Honor,
I second that request.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.870
Court calendars
being what they are,

23:32.912 --> 23:37.166
putting this off for 30 days
might as well be 90.

23:37.208 --> 23:41.420
Mr. Borders, are you willing
to go back to San Quentin

23:41.462 --> 23:43.297
for another three months?

23:43.339 --> 23:48.219
Um... yeah, I-I don't suppose
a little more time matters

23:48.261 --> 23:50.346
if it means they get it right.

23:50.388 --> 23:52.974
That's exactly what the court
is trying to do here,

23:53.015 --> 23:55.643
-get it right.
-(door opens)

24:06.320 --> 24:09.490
Your Honor, my client is
the injured party here.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.576
His reputation has been damaged,

24:11.617 --> 24:14.745
and delaying this 90 days
will permanently destroy it.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.205
We object to any delay,

24:16.247 --> 24:18.040
and would like to offer
a solution.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.417
Go ahead, Ms. Chandler.

the lawyers and principals

I plan to introduce.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.350

I'll be putting up, Your Honor.

27:27.521 --> 27:30.608
I have a sworn statement
from a corrections officer

27:30.649 --> 27:32.693
who witnessed
Olmer's deathbed confession

27:32.735 --> 27:36.030
and saw Mr. Cronyn use
an identical handkerchief

27:36.072 --> 27:39.575
to wipe the dying man's hands,
thus procuring his DNA.

27:39.617 --> 27:42.244
We will then show
how he arranged

27:42.286 --> 27:44.663
to have that handkerchief
switched for the original

27:44.705 --> 27:48.584
and placed in the case evidence
box in LAPD Property Control.

27:48.626 --> 27:52.046
Your Honor, Mr. Cronyn could not
have come near that material.

27:52.088 --> 27:54.382
Chain-of-evidence protocol
requires a secure

27:54.423 --> 27:56.592
lab-to-lab transfer.

27:56.634 --> 27:57.927
Detective Bosch will testify
to how he thinks

27:57.968 --> 27:59.261
this scheme was carried out.

27:59.303 --> 28:02.556
We have Property Room video
to corroborate his theory.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.643
In addition, I would like
to call Christina Henry,

28:05.684 --> 28:10.064
of the CIU, and your court
reporter, Rita Tedesco.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.610
Please elaborate as to why.

28:14.652 --> 28:17.238
Ms. Henry to testify
to her personal history

28:17.279 --> 28:19.949
of intimacy and animus
with Detective Bosch.

28:19.990 --> 28:23.828
I will offer a recent draft memo
which clearly indicates

28:23.869 --> 28:25.287
her bias toward my client.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.790
Your Honor, I would like to know
the provenance

28:27.832 --> 28:31.001
of this purported memo
and how counsel acquired it.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.754
SOBEL: You'll get your turn,
Mr. Kennedy.

28:33.796 --> 28:34.839
And Ms. Tedesco?

28:34.880 --> 28:37.675
To testify to her
matrimonial status,

28:37.716 --> 28:39.885
which she has kept secret
from this court

28:39.927 --> 28:42.430
in furtherance of the conspiracy

28:42.471 --> 28:44.181
between the Cronyns
and Mr. Borders.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.599
And what is that status?

28:45.641 --> 28:47.726
She is married to Mr. Borders.

28:47.768 --> 28:51.313
Rita, is this true?

28:53.566 --> 28:55.818
Yes, Your Honor.

28:55.860 --> 28:58.946
For how long?

28:58.988 --> 29:02.074
Uh... uh, for 16 years.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.080
We'll sidebar.

29:08.122 --> 29:10.833
Continue, Ms. Chandler.

29:10.875 --> 29:13.002
Well, finally, Your Honor,
I will provide evidence

29:13.043 --> 29:15.212
from Terrence Spencer,
the Property Room clerk,

29:15.254 --> 29:17.298
who became enmeshed
with the Cronyns,

29:17.339 --> 29:21.260
and how they persuaded him
to aid them in their conspiracy.

29:22.970 --> 29:26.515
Do you have an affidavit
from Mr. Spencer, Ms. Chandler?

29:26.557 --> 29:28.517
Your Honor, I have
Terrence Spencer himself

29:28.559 --> 29:29.727
here to testify.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.187
What the fuck?

29:31.228 --> 29:33.772
Control your client, Mr. Cronyn.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.399
-Yes, Your Honor.
-(Borders mutters)

29:35.441 --> 29:36.859
SOBEL:
Please continue, Ms. Chandler.

29:36.901 --> 29:39.278
CHANDLER: He's been sequestered
at a home owned by Mrs. Cronyn.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.698
He's here now, and he's ready
to take the stand

29:42.740 --> 29:45.117
and explain his role
in this conspiracy.

29:45.159 --> 29:46.744
You fucking moron!

29:46.785 --> 29:49.038
You said this would work.

29:49.079 --> 29:51.040
-Shut up.
-Asshole.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.708
I'm telling 'em everything.

29:52.750 --> 29:55.544
I'm telling 'em your whole
fucking fucked-up plan.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.757
Your Honor, at this time,
the people wish

29:59.798 --> 30:02.426
to withdraw their motions
in this matter.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.303
We now oppose
the habeas petition.

30:06.347 --> 30:07.765
SOBEL:
I'm sure you do.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.767
But you can take your seat
for the moment.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.438
Mr. Borders,

30:14.480 --> 30:18.484
your petition for habeas corpus
is no longer uncontested.

30:18.526 --> 30:21.570
Is it your desire now
to withdraw it?

30:21.612 --> 30:23.739
Yeah, might as well.

30:23.781 --> 30:26.492
'Cause it ain't fucking
going nowhere.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.577
The matter before the court
is withdrawn.

30:28.619 --> 30:31.288
Deputies, you can take
Mr. Borders back to jail.

30:32.623 --> 30:34.041
Thanks for the road trip,
Cronyn.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.877
Beats three days in a cage.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.172
Sorry, babe.

30:40.214 --> 30:42.675
-Do what you got to do.
-I won't leave you, Pres.

30:42.716 --> 30:43.676
I promise.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.053
Yeah, well,
we know how that goes.

30:46.095 --> 30:47.972
-I won't hold you to it.
-Pres...

30:48.013 --> 30:50.224
Fuck you all very much.

30:50.266 --> 30:51.559
And fuck you, Bosch!

30:51.600 --> 30:53.102
You planted
that fucking pendant!

30:53.143 --> 30:56.272
I know you did.
You stole it from my backpack!

30:56.313 --> 30:57.606
Get the fuck off me.

30:59.149 --> 31:01.068
Your Honor, if I may,
I need to get on the record

31:01.110 --> 31:03.070
how my client threatened me
and my wife.

31:03.112 --> 31:05.072
Enough, Mr. Cronyn.

31:05.114 --> 31:06.865
You, your cocounsel
and your client

31:06.907 --> 31:09.159
came into this courtroom
with the clear intent

31:09.201 --> 31:11.662
of manipulating the court
for financial gain,

31:11.704 --> 31:15.165
gaining the release of
a rightfully convicted murderer,

31:15.207 --> 31:18.627
and tarnishing the reputation
of a veteran detective.

31:18.669 --> 31:20.671
-Your Honor...
-I find

31:20.713 --> 31:23.007
Lance Cronyn
and Katherine Zelden Cronyn

31:23.048 --> 31:25.009
in criminal contempt
of the court,

31:25.050 --> 31:27.136
and order them
taken into custody forthwith.

31:27.177 --> 31:30.431
-Y-You can't do that.
-Oh, yes, I can.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.310
-(handcuffs clicking)
-Now, Mr. Kennedy.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.604
-Yes, Your Honor?
-Your office

31:36.645 --> 31:41.066
owes Detective Bosch
a big, fat, public apology.

31:41.108 --> 31:45.738
Nothing short of full
exoneration of the allegations

31:45.779 --> 31:47.781
published in the L.A. Times
will suffice.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.742
Do I make myself clear,
Mr. Kennedy?

31:49.783 --> 31:51.368
Yes, Your Honor.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.996
We would be doing that
even if you had not ordered it.

31:54.038 --> 31:57.166
Knowing what I know about
politics and the justice system,

31:57.207 --> 31:59.335
I find that highly unlikely.

32:04.298 --> 32:06.050
Detective Bosch.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.926
Yes, Your Honor?

32:07.968 --> 32:12.222
I would like to apologize
on behalf of the court.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.850
I wish you
the best of luck, sir.

32:14.892 --> 32:17.978
And you're welcome
in my courtroom anytime.

32:18.020 --> 32:20.731
Thank you, Your Honor.

32:38.248 --> 32:41.210
Give you a lift?

32:41.251 --> 32:43.295
I got to grab my stuff.

32:43.337 --> 32:45.506
I'll wait.
Meet you downstairs?

32:45.547 --> 32:47.216
Okay.

32:47.257 --> 32:48.884
Congratulations.

32:48.926 --> 32:51.345
Thanks.

32:51.387 --> 32:53.514
-Love you.
-You, too.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.394
Whew.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.229
-"Cahoots."
-(chuckles)

33:00.270 --> 33:02.648
My Clarence Darrow moment.

33:02.690 --> 33:03.774
Too folksy?

33:03.816 --> 33:06.360
-Borderline.
-(chuckles)

33:06.402 --> 33:07.945
You didn't even need me.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.155
I would have if we'd
gone back to open court.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.740
Spencer's lawyer just told me

33:11.782 --> 33:13.534
he was only here
to take the Fifth.

33:13.575 --> 33:15.119
Holy shit.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.955
Holy shit indeed.

33:17.996 --> 33:21.250
We should celebrate.
Dinner sometime soon?

33:21.291 --> 33:24.294
I'd like that. I'm buying.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.338
Then I'm choosing where.

33:29.091 --> 33:31.218
Thank you.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.262
I'll call you.

33:38.142 --> 33:39.977
You must be feeling good.

33:43.313 --> 33:46.108
(exhales) I am.

33:48.569 --> 33:50.946
I know what you did.

33:52.990 --> 33:54.992
What?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.578
Read the memo
that was on my desk.

33:57.619 --> 33:59.997
Tom...

34:00.038 --> 34:02.166
Then you sent it
to your father's lawyer.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.759
What are you gonna do about it?

34:17.681 --> 34:19.850
I don't know yet.

34:23.228 --> 34:27.191
Thanks for not lying to me,
at least.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.406
(sighs)

34:34.448 --> 34:36.950
(elevator bell dings)

34:36.992 --> 34:39.995
-HENRY: Here to rub it in?
-No, here to collect my kid.

34:40.037 --> 34:41.455
You did it.

34:41.497 --> 34:43.040
-I know you did it.
-Look.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.209
You took your best shot,
you came up short.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.960
-Move on.
-I'm not done with this.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.546
-I heard what Borders said.
-Then you heard him confess.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.840
By the way,
you give bullshit a bad name.

34:51.882 --> 34:54.635
-I didn't stunt your career.
-The fuck you didn't.

34:54.676 --> 34:55.928
You weren't good enough.

34:55.969 --> 34:57.221
The department didn't need me
to tell them that.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.264
You campaigned against me,
you bastard.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.934
Come on, Christina.
He's not worth it.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.602
I'm watching you, Bosch.

35:03.644 --> 35:06.188
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-(elevator bell dings)

35:09.525 --> 35:11.527
(elevator doors close)

35:14.279 --> 35:15.989
Sorry you had to see that.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.699
What's her problem?

35:17.741 --> 35:19.910
Guess she just felt like
she had to piss on my parade.

35:19.952 --> 35:22.329
Know the feeling.

35:22.371 --> 35:24.248
What?

35:24.289 --> 35:26.959
Let's just go home.

35:39.888 --> 35:43.141
-Where's Ida?
-Oh, I let her go early.

35:45.435 --> 35:49.022
-You ready?
-Just about.

35:49.064 --> 35:52.234
When exactly do you think you're
gonna have time for those?

35:52.276 --> 35:54.069
After dinner.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.113
I don't think so.

36:00.450 --> 36:02.369
Well, then.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.878
Jen Kowski called me today.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.880
What'd she say?

36:12.921 --> 36:14.965
Just taking my temperature.

36:15.007 --> 36:17.134
What'd you tell her?

36:17.175 --> 36:19.636
I told her
I'm seriously considering it.

36:21.638 --> 36:25.267
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

36:28.478 --> 36:31.273
Mr. Mayor.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.275
(dog collar jangles)

36:33.317 --> 36:35.485
(panting, whining)

36:35.527 --> 36:36.737
(chuckles):
Hey.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.030
Hey.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.996
-Thanks.
-As requested.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.165
Appreciate it.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.626
-Come here.
-What's his name?

36:50.667 --> 36:52.586
I don't know yet.

36:52.628 --> 36:55.088
-Maybe I'll call him Hovan.
-(laughs)

36:55.130 --> 36:57.090
You want a beer, man?

36:57.132 --> 36:59.217
Still on the clock.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.053
I hear congratulations
are in order.

37:01.094 --> 37:03.138
I dodged a bullet.

37:03.180 --> 37:05.098
Any word on Walsh?

37:05.140 --> 37:07.225
We think he's left the country.

37:07.267 --> 37:08.810
Mexico.

37:08.852 --> 37:12.606
Thought he was persona non grata
south of the border.

37:12.648 --> 37:15.275
Linked up with the Zetas.
Fentanyl.

37:15.317 --> 37:18.737
Yeah, always another cartel.
And another drug.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.449
Hold back the night.

37:22.491 --> 37:25.494
Somebody's got to.

37:25.535 --> 37:26.954
Hey.

37:29.122 --> 37:31.333
-Thanks again.
-My pleasure.

37:31.375 --> 37:33.210
-Adios.
-Adios.

37:38.382 --> 37:40.008
(whispers):
Hey.

37:48.517 --> 37:50.519
(brakes squeal softly)

37:55.482 --> 37:57.484
(musical chiming)

38:02.280 --> 38:03.907
(door unlocks)

38:08.745 --> 38:11.623
Mr. Avril, Detective Edgar.

38:11.665 --> 38:13.625
LAPD.

38:13.667 --> 38:16.003
I know who you are.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.631
There are not so many of us.

38:19.673 --> 38:23.593
I saw you at the Little Jewel
the other day, did I not?

38:23.635 --> 38:25.887
You were leaving
as I was coming in.

38:25.929 --> 38:28.557
We have mutual friends.

38:28.598 --> 38:30.600
Marcos and Arias.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.605
You should have joined us,
last night at the club.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.442
My people saw you there.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.903
I didn't want to intrude.

38:41.945 --> 38:45.198
Next time.

38:46.533 --> 38:49.161
Would you like to come in?

38:49.202 --> 38:51.538
-Another time.
-Ah.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.457
I look forward
to getting to know you.

38:53.498 --> 38:56.168
-One question.
-Yes?

38:56.209 --> 38:59.087
-Are you who I think you are?
-And who is that?

38:59.129 --> 39:02.340
Jacques Avril, secret police.

39:02.382 --> 39:06.178
The Butcher of Pétion-Ville...

39:06.219 --> 39:08.472
who murdered
my mother's brother.

39:08.513 --> 39:12.100
What was his name?
Your uncle.

39:12.142 --> 39:14.227
Antoine Hector.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.146
Hmm.

39:16.188 --> 39:18.857
Wasn't me.

39:18.899 --> 39:21.401
That was my father.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.617
(lock clicks)

39:35.332 --> 39:39.127
Oh, an hour. Less.

39:39.169 --> 39:41.671
Hmm. We'll order.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.925
No, you choose.
I don't care.

39:44.966 --> 39:47.135
Yeah, be home soon.
See you then.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.386
(sniffles)

39:48.428 --> 39:49.930
(clears throat)

39:51.932 --> 39:54.392
Buy you a drink?

39:54.434 --> 39:56.394
I already have one.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.195
-Martini, please.
-Gin preference?

40:05.237 --> 40:06.822
Uh, Hendrick's.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.907
Paying for her, too?

40:08.949 --> 40:10.784
You're kidding.

40:12.828 --> 40:16.206
(chuckles) Sure.

40:18.250 --> 40:21.128
I needed to look him in the eye.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.421
-Can't you arrest him?
-For what?

40:23.463 --> 40:25.382
He hasn't done anything here.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.218
-How long's he been here?
-Since 2010.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.011
-Since the earthquake.
-(refrigerator opens)

40:30.053 --> 40:33.598
Doing well. Really well.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.934
Living openly
under his own name.

40:35.976 --> 40:38.186
It's freaking people out.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.190
(bottle opens)

40:42.232 --> 40:44.734
I mean, he has
so much blood on his hands.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.444
(exhales)

40:46.486 --> 40:49.489
What did Gary have to do
with these people?

40:49.531 --> 40:52.576
-Why'd they kill my son?
-I don't know yet.

40:55.662 --> 40:58.582
If you could get Jonas
to I.D. the Jamaicans,

40:58.623 --> 41:00.208
you could squeeze them.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.002
Maybe they'd give up
Marcos and Arias.

41:02.043 --> 41:05.463
But he won't.
He doesn't trust us.

41:09.342 --> 41:10.969
This is bad, Jerry.

41:12.846 --> 41:15.473
Dirty cops.

41:15.515 --> 41:18.810
-Be careful.
-I know it.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.148
I could help you.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.658
Hey.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.744
He looks like he's adjusting.

41:35.785 --> 41:37.579
Yeah.

41:37.621 --> 41:39.497
He's a good boy.

41:39.539 --> 41:41.750
Had to keep him away
from the raccoons, though.

41:41.791 --> 41:43.376
He's kind of scrappy.

41:43.418 --> 41:46.463
-What are you gonna call him?
-I don't know.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.673
Maybe Scrappy.

41:48.715 --> 41:51.092
-Very creative.
-Pooch.

41:51.134 --> 41:52.636
Cochise.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.095
I don't know. Biscuit?

41:54.137 --> 41:55.472
Biscuit?

41:55.513 --> 41:57.349
Help me out here.

41:59.142 --> 42:00.727
I'll sleep on it.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.397
Listen.

42:04.439 --> 42:07.067
I wanted to tell you.

42:07.108 --> 42:10.487
I'm going back to school early.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.530
Like, tomorrow.

42:12.572 --> 42:15.283
Why?

42:17.327 --> 42:19.829
Need to get ready
for the fall semester.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.375
You give notice?

42:23.416 --> 42:26.878
-I just sent the email.
-So early?

42:26.920 --> 42:28.922
Come on, talk to me.

42:28.964 --> 42:30.966
What's going on?

42:31.007 --> 42:32.968
-Boyfriend trouble?
-No.

42:33.009 --> 42:34.511
'Cause I noticed
a little tension there.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.638
It's not him.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.223
It's you.

42:42.394 --> 42:44.229
Me?

42:44.271 --> 42:46.314
What'd I do?

42:46.356 --> 42:47.983
Nothing.

42:50.026 --> 42:51.611
You're just you.

42:53.530 --> 42:56.574
And I need some time
away from you.

42:58.618 --> 43:00.412
Sound like your mother.

43:00.453 --> 43:03.540
I'm sure I do.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.128
Still pissed about
the undercover caper.

43:08.169 --> 43:12.048
Can we talk about this later?

43:12.090 --> 43:13.717
I'm beat.

43:15.719 --> 43:17.762
At least stay
until her birthday.

43:17.804 --> 43:19.431
Catalina?

43:22.350 --> 43:23.977
Maybe next year.

43:29.691 --> 43:31.693
(dog grunts softly)

43:33.028 --> 43:35.030
(phone ringing)

43:39.451 --> 43:42.162
-Chief.
-Bad time?

43:42.203 --> 43:44.748
Long day.

43:44.789 --> 43:48.209
Well, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

43:48.251 --> 43:50.545
Thanks.

43:50.587 --> 43:53.381
I trust this puts
this matter to rest.

43:53.423 --> 43:55.592
Not quite.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.553
I'm sorry?

43:58.595 --> 44:01.264
Loose end I need to tie up.

44:03.099 --> 44:05.101
Have a good evening.
