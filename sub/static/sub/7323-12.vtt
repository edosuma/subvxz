FRESH START...

00:07.408 --> 00:09.180
CLEAN SLATE...

00:09.180 --> 00:11.682

WHAT NEW ADVENTURE

00:14.215 --> 00:16.547
YOU'RE EMBARKING ON,

NEXT TIME.

00:24.255 --> 00:25.656
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

00:25.656 --> 00:28.399

00:28.399 --> 00:29.800
NO, IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.403
WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP DOING IT
UNTIL WE GET IT RIGHT, RIGHT?

00:32.403 --> 00:34.105
RIGHT.

00:34.105 --> 00:38.139

NEW BEGINNING IN YOUR LIFE.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.141
SO HOW DIFFERENT...

05:03.834 --> 05:06.707

ASPECTS OF THE CASE?

05:33.434 --> 05:36.336
HE'S BEEN BROUGHT UP TO SPEED.
DID SHE TELL YOU
THAT HENRY HERE

05:36.336 --> 05:38.068
ORIGINALLY
WAS DENIED THIS SURGERY

05:38.068 --> 05:39.670
BECAUSE HE WAS UNINSURED?

05:39.670 --> 05:43.073
UM, NO. I MEAN,
SHE DIDN'T MENTION... THAT.

05:43.073 --> 05:45.345

06:03.033 --> 06:06.366
JUST A FEW SIGNATURES,

BRADY SULLIVAN, 32.

06:43.133 --> 06:45.676
STABLE VITAL SIGNS, COMPLAINTS
OF NECK AND BACK PAINS.

06:45.676 --> 06:48.809
POSSIBLE CRUSH INJURIES.
HE WAS TRAMPLED BY A HORSE.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.411
A HORSE?
A-A TEAM OF HORSES,
LIKE--LIKE THREE HORSES,

06:51.411 --> 06:53.113
IF THAT HELPS YOU AT ALL.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.115
PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T LET HIM
DIE ON OUR WEDDING DAY.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.847
AAH! OH!

06:56.847 --> 06:59.590
PUSH 5 OF MORPHINE.
WE WERE GOING DOWNTOWN
THIS MORNING

06:59.590 --> 07:02.553
TO SIGN OUR
DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP PAPERS...
THERE'S A LOT
OF BRUISING HERE.

07:02.553 --> 07:04.555
AND I HAD A HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE
TO PICK US UP FROM CITY HALL

07:04.555 --> 07:06.657
AND--AND BAGPIPERS,
BECAUSE BRADY IS SCOTTISH,

07:06.657 --> 07:09.660
AND HE REALLY LIKES
BEING SCOTTISH.
OKAY, I FEEL TENDERNESS
AT C-6.

07:09.660 --> 07:13.003
GET X-RAY IN HERE, STAT.
BRADY, I AM SO SORRY.
THE BAGPIPERS STARTED UP,

07:13.003 --> 07:15.466
AND THEY SPOOKED THE HORSES,
AND--AND THEY RAN.

07:15.466 --> 07:17.668
OVER ME.
THEY ALL RAN OVER ME, KYLE.

07:17.668 --> 07:20.070
BAGPIPES?
ALL RIGHT, EXAM SHOWS WEAKNESS
IN LOWER EXTREMITIES.

07:20.070 --> 07:22.573
I'VE GOT
DIMINISHED REFLEXES.
MOVE. I CAN'T WORK.

07:22.573 --> 07:25.115
DUDE...
SORRY, SORRY.

07:25.115 --> 07:27.978
I AGREED TO THE TUXES,
BUT HORSES?
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A SURPRISE.

07:27.978 --> 07:30.951
IT WAS.
(Callie) OKAY. YEAH. LOOKS LIKE
L-4 AND L-5 ARE AFFECTED.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.724
PAGE SHEPHERD. ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET HIM READY FOR C.T.

07:33.724 --> 07:36.857

I HAVE A RIGHT TO STAY WITH HIM.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.989
AVERY,
GET HIM OUTTA HERE NOW.
MOVE.

07:38.989 --> 07:41.862
(Edward) SORRY.
OH, MY G--OKAY,
EVERYBODY OUT. NOW.

07:43.494 --> 07:45.636
NOW! BEFORE I HAVE TO
TAKE SOMEONE OUT.

07:54.144 --> 07:56.146
YOU MARRIED A PATIENT
TO GIVE HIM INSURANCE?

07:56.146 --> 07:58.248
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

07:58.248 --> 08:00.781
INSURANCE FRAUD
IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE.
ACTUALLY, ACCORDING TO

08:00.781 --> 08:03.053
THE NATIONAL MEDICAL
ANTI-FRAUD ASSOCIATION,

08:03.053 --> 08:05.055
IT'S NOT INSURANCE FRAUD,
IT'S JUST FROWNED UPON.

08:05.055 --> 08:07.758
IT'S HIGHLY UNETHICAL.
YOU'RE A DOCTOR, FOR GOD SAKES.

08:07.758 --> 08:09.489
THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY
IS FAIRLY SPLIT ON THIS.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.022
IS IT MORE UNETHICAL TO DENY
A PATIENT LIFESAVING CARE

08:12.022 --> 08:15.265
OR TO MARRY A PATIENT AND GIVE
HIM THAT CARE? IT CAN GET MURKY.
DON'T YOU HAVE SOMEWHERE
TO BE, DR. GREY?

08:15.265 --> 08:17.898
I'M ON
DR. ALTMAN'S SERVICE TODAY.
WE ARE DOCTORS.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.671
WE SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES EVERY DAY
WITHOUT MARRYING THEM.

08:20.671 --> 08:22.202
YOU MARRY SOMEONE YOU LOVE.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.204
WELL, I LOVE HIM. I DO.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.177
I MEAN, I LOVE HIM...
SOMUCH.

08:27.177 --> 08:29.880
DR. ALTMAN,
THIS ISN'T A JOKE.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.282
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN,
CHIEF, BUT IT'S DONE.

08:32.282 --> 08:34.284
HE HAS INSURANCE,
YOU'RE HIS DOCTOR,

08:34.284 --> 08:37.287
AND NOW
YOU CAN SAVE HIS LIFE.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.652
(sighs)

08:41.652 --> 08:44.054
(sighs)
PLEASE DON'T TELL THE CHIEF
I SAID THIS,

08:44.054 --> 08:47.798
BUT I THINK WHAT YOU DID
WAS AWESOME.
(Arizona) I MEAN, I GET IT.

08:47.798 --> 08:49.800
SHE'S GOT A HANG-UP ABOUT ME
BEING PERFECT. YOU KNOW,

08:49.800 --> 08:52.532
EVERYTHING COMES EASY FOR ME,
AND I DON'T HAVE ANY FLAWS,

08:52.532 --> 08:55.065
AND NOW THAT I'VE CLEARLY
MADE A MISTAKE,

08:55.065 --> 08:58.669
SHE'S JUST GONNA
POUND THE CRAP OUT OF IT.
(laughs) SO YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'RE PERFECT?

08:58.669 --> 09:00.711
NO. I HAVE LOTS OF FLAWS.
I'M COMPETITIVE,

09:00.711 --> 09:03.043
I'M A WORKAHOLIC,
I SMOKE WHEN I'M STRESSED.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.046
IT'S DISGUSTING.
WELL, I'M SURE SHE'D LOVE
TO HEAR ALL THOSE,

09:06.046 --> 09:09.049
ALONG WITH ANY OTHER
REAL FAULTS YOU COME UP WITH.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.151
YOU WERE THAT GUY
ON "SEATTLE MED," RIGHT?

09:11.151 --> 09:13.153
THE ONE WHO MADE
A TRACHEA FROM SCRATCH.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.825
WELL, STEM CELLS,
NOT SCRATCH.

09:14.825 --> 09:16.627
BUT YEAH, THAT'S--
THAT'S ME.

09:16.627 --> 09:17.958
BADASS.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.560
I'M REALLY INTERESTED
IN REGENERATIVE MEDICINE.
YEAH?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.563
MM-HMM.
I'LL SHOW YOU A BLADDER
WE'RE GROWING IN THE LAB

09:23.563 --> 09:24.965
AFTER ROUNDS.
OKAY.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.837
LADIES FIRST.

09:26.837 --> 09:28.238
YOU'RE HER TEACHER, ALEX.

09:28.238 --> 09:30.300
ONLY FOR THE DAY.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.142
(elevator bell dings)

09:32.142 --> 09:37.047
(Alex) UH, SARAH CASSIDY, 15,
HAS A RARE GENETIC CONDITION

09:37.047 --> 09:38.849
CALLED
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME...
(sighs)

09:38.849 --> 09:41.812
WHICH CAUSED HER TO BE BORN
WITHOUT CHEEK BONES,

09:41.812 --> 09:44.284
LEAVING HER ORBITAL FLOOR
UNPROTECTED,

09:44.284 --> 09:46.717
AND VULNERABLE TO EYE INJURY.
WHICH MEANS
THE ONLY EXTRACURRICULARS

09:46.717 --> 09:48.719
I CAN SIGN UP FOR ARE THE ONES

09:48.719 --> 09:51.291
THAT DON'T INVOLVE THINGS
FLYING AT MY FACE.
SHE ROCKS THE CHESS CLUB.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.794
I JUST WANT TO PLAY SPORTS.
YOU BOWL, HONEY.

09:53.794 --> 09:57.097
NOT REALLY A SPORT, DAD.
YOU, UH, YOU MIND
IF I TAKE A LOOK?

09:57.097 --> 09:59.069
SCOOT OVER A LITTLE
SO LAUREL CAN SEE.

09:59.069 --> 10:01.932
(Arizona) SARAH, WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE PIECES FROM YOUR SKULL

10:01.932 --> 10:04.905
AND TRANSPLANT THEM INTO YOUR
FACE TO REBUILD NEW CHEEKBONES.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.937
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
OR CONCERNS?

10:06.937 --> 10:09.710
VOLLEYBALL TRYOUTS ARE
IN TWO MONTHS. CAN I TRYOUT?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.385
HEY. SORRY I'M LATE.

10:15.385 --> 10:18.889
HERE ARE THE FORMS.
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY INSURED.

10:18.889 --> 10:21.652
AMAZING. AND I HAVE NOTHING
TO GIVE YOU IN RETURN.

10:21.652 --> 10:23.694
WAIT. ARE YOU HUNGRY?

10:23.694 --> 10:27.227
YOU WANT A FRUIT CUP?
HENRY, YOU NEEDED INSURANCE.
I WAS HAPPY TO GIVE IT.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.259
COME ON.
TAKE THE FRUIT CUP.

10:29.259 --> 10:31.401
WELL, I AM STARVING.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.868
(mouth full)
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

10:37.868 --> 10:40.871
YEAH. I WOULDN'T EAT IT
IF I WERE DYING.
(laughs)

10:40.871 --> 10:41.942
(chuckles)

10:41.942 --> 10:44.214
I SHOULD GO. UM...

10:44.214 --> 10:46.747
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR SURGERY.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.179
THANK YOU, DR. ALTMAN.

10:49.179 --> 10:50.751
MM.

10:53.323 --> 10:56.326
WOW. A VOLLEYBALL PLAYER.
DIGGING INTO HER SKULL
WILL TACK ON

10:56.326 --> 10:58.328
AN EXTRA YEAR OF HEALING,
YOU KNOW?

10:58.328 --> 11:00.430
WELL, MAYBE SHE'LL PLAY
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, THEN.

11:00.430 --> 11:02.662
WELL, DID YOU CONSIDER
THE STEM CELL SURGERY

11:02.662 --> 11:05.065
THEY DID IN CINCINNATI
USING A CADAVER BONE GRAFT?
OH, IT'S TOO EXPERIMENTAL.

11:05.065 --> 11:08.068
I THINK IT'S WORTH CONSIDERING
GIVEN HER AGE.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.671
I THINK CONSIDERING HER AGE,
IT'S BEST TO BE CONSERVATIVE.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.804
I'LL SEE YOU IN SURGERY.

11:13.804 --> 11:15.305
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

11:15.305 --> 11:17.307
CAN WE, UH, GO IN
AND SEE THE SCANS?

11:17.307 --> 11:20.680
PRETTY SMALL ROOM.
LET'S JUST WAIT.
HE'S GOT TANDEM LESIONS,

11:20.680 --> 11:22.682
A FRACTURE TRANSLOCATION
AT L-4 AND 5,

11:22.682 --> 11:25.055
AND A UNILATERAL JUMPED FACET
AT C-5 AND 6.

11:25.055 --> 11:27.457
(Edward) WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS ONE OF THE JOINTS
IN HIS NECK

11:27.457 --> 11:30.761
WAS KNOCKED OUT OF PLACE,
AND HE'S GOT A BROKEN BACK.
THAT ONE'S YOUR HUSBAND?

11:30.761 --> 11:34.294
WHAT? YES.
CAN I JUST SAY, JACKPOT?

11:34.294 --> 11:36.326
I MEAN, YOU GET TO BE AT WORK
WITH THAT ALL DAY

11:36.326 --> 11:39.369
AND GO HOME TO HIM AT NIGHT?
(elevator bell dings)

11:39.369 --> 11:41.802
I'M GONNA GO SEE
WHERE THEY'RE AT.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.434
(Derek) I'M WORRIED
ABOUT HIS NECK. I DON'T THINK

11:44.434 --> 11:47.207
HE SHOULD BE INTUBATED
WITH A CERVICAL INJURY.
(Callie) WELL, I COULD DO
A LITTLE TRACTION.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.209
SNAP IT BACK IN
BEFORE WE DO SURGERY.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.241
(sighs)
HELL OF A WEDDING DAY.
(Callie and Derek) MM.

11:51.241 --> 11:54.484
THEY SAY IF YOU WANT TO PISS OFF
GOD, JUST TELL HIM YOUR PLANS.

11:54.484 --> 11:57.347
DUDE, OUT, OUT, OUT.

11:57.347 --> 12:00.050
(sighs) I DON'T...

12:00.050 --> 12:02.452
THAT IS THE BIGGEST PHEO
I'VE EVER SEEN.

12:02.452 --> 12:04.995
IS IT INFILTRATING
THE KIDNEY THERE?

12:04.995 --> 12:08.128
IS THAT--THAT--
THAT'S THE SPLEEN, RIGHT?
NO, THAT'S THE LIVER.

12:08.128 --> 12:11.731
OH. OKAY, SO IS THAT
THE TUMOR?
THAT'S A GALL BLADDER.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.434
WAIT. REALLY?
CROSS MY HEART.
HOPE TO DIE.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.037
THE IMAGE IS REVERSED
ON AN M.R.I.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.438
IT'S CONFUSING AT FIRST.

12:18.438 --> 12:22.272
I'M SURE DR. YANG CAN REMEMBER
SEEING HER FIRST M.R.I.

12:22.272 --> 12:24.414
AND EMPATHIZE.

12:24.414 --> 12:26.917
EMPATHY IS A GOOD QUALITY
FOR A CHIEF RESIDENT,

12:26.917 --> 12:29.279
DON'T YOU THINK, DR. BAILEY?
OH, I DO, SIR.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.356
THIS IS FROM THE FEET
LOOKING UP,

12:36.356 --> 12:38.228
SO THAT'S THE KIDNEY,

12:38.228 --> 12:41.161
THAT'S THE ADRENAL GLAND,
AND THAT IS THE TUMOR.

12:41.161 --> 12:44.494
THAT'S THE TUMOR? IT--
IT'S EATING INTO THE KIDNEY.

12:44.494 --> 12:47.838
RIGHT. I WAS HOPING
WE'D ONLY HAVE TO REMOVE

12:47.838 --> 12:49.239
THE ADRENAL GLAND.

12:49.239 --> 12:50.841
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

12:50.841 --> 12:53.443
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
HENRY'S KIDNEY AS WELL.

12:53.443 --> 12:55.445
(Callie) DR. SHEPHERD
WILL DECOMPRESS

12:55.445 --> 12:58.448
THE NERVE ROOTS FROM BEHIND,
AND THEN I WILL PUT IN

12:58.448 --> 13:00.450
A GRAFT AND A PLATE
FOR STABILIZATION.

13:00.450 --> 13:02.512
BUT BEFORE ANY OF THAT
CAN HAPPEN,

13:02.512 --> 13:05.415
WE NEED TO MOVE YOUR NECK
BACK INTO PLACE.

13:05.415 --> 13:08.188
FUN.
I'LL BE DONE
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

13:08.188 --> 13:11.892
SIR, YOU PROBABLY DON'T
WANT TO BE HERE FOR THIS.
NO, I'M STAYING.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.224
KYLE, DON'T OVERDO IT.
YOU ALWAYS--
THERE'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF, UM--

13:14.224 --> 13:16.897
I'M STAYING.
IT'S MY FAULT HE'S HERE.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.399
IF HE'S IN PAIN,
I'LL BE HERE WITH HIM.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.401
STOP TRYING TO KICK ME OUT.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.403
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD STAY.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.375
HOLD HIS HAND.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.537
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

13:27.537 --> 13:29.279
OKAY, BRADY,

13:29.279 --> 13:32.482
YOU READY?
OKAY.

13:32.482 --> 13:35.085
OKAY. ONE, TWO... THREE.

13:35.085 --> 13:36.416
(loud crack)
AAH!

13:36.416 --> 13:38.849
OH, MY GOD!

13:38.849 --> 13:40.590
(Brady screams and coughs)

13:40.590 --> 13:42.322
SO HOW'D MY TUMOR LOOK?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.324
WE DON'T HAVE, UH,
THE RESULTS

13:44.324 --> 13:46.056
FROM ALL THE SCANS YET.

13:46.056 --> 13:48.458
I'VE HAD 11 OPERATIONS
IN THE PAST 3 YEARS.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.600
I HAVE TUMORS REMOVED
AS A HOBBY.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.202
I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.

13:52.202 --> 13:54.564
YOU KNOW THE RESULTS,
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL ME.

13:54.564 --> 13:57.037
SO GIVE ME A HINT.
I MEAN, LOOK,

13:57.037 --> 14:00.170
ARE WE TALKING MARBLE,
GRAPEFRUIT, BASKETBALL?
DR. WEBBER
WILL BE UP SHORTLY

14:00.170 --> 14:03.213
TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS
OF THE SCAN.
COME ON, FRED.
WHAT'D YOU SEE?

14:03.213 --> 14:05.215
NO, HE'S A FIRST-YEAR
MED STUDENT.

14:05.215 --> 14:07.948
HE CAN'T EVEN READ A SCAN.
THEN WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE
HE'S GONNA PISS HIMSELF?

14:07.948 --> 14:10.450
LOOK AT HIS FACE.
HE'S SWEATING.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.223
WHAT'S GOING ON?
AM I GONNA DIE?
NO, I'M NOT--MY FACE...

14:13.223 --> 14:15.185
IT--DON'T LET ME--

14:15.185 --> 14:17.187
'CAUSE I'M JUST--
LIKE SHE SAID, PRETEND I'M--

14:17.187 --> 14:19.990
STOP TALKING.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.992
WHAT'D YOU SEE, FRED?
NOTHING.

14:21.992 --> 14:24.334
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. TRULY.

14:24.334 --> 14:27.267
MY UNCLE HAD
HIS KIDNEY REMOVED, AND HE'S--
WHAT?

14:27.267 --> 14:30.000
OH, GOD. I'M SORRY.
STOP TALKING.
MR. BURTON--

14:30.000 --> 14:32.402
YOU HAVE TO REMOVE
MY KIDNEY?

14:32.402 --> 14:35.976
DO YOU? DO YOU HAVE TO
TAKE OUT MY KIDNEY?

14:47.357 --> 14:49.359
THE TUMOR
ON YOUR ADRENAL GLAND

14:49.359 --> 14:51.361
HAS COMPROMISED YOUR KIDNEY.

14:51.361 --> 14:54.164
IT'S ENOUGH DAMAGE
THAT WE NEED TO REMOVE IT.

14:54.164 --> 14:56.496
(Miranda) I KNOW.
IT--IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT,

14:56.496 --> 14:58.628
BUT IT REALLY IS
OUR BEST OPTION.

14:58.628 --> 15:02.032
COULD WE ASK DR. ALTMAN
WHAT SHE THINKS?

15:02.032 --> 15:04.034
UH, DR. ALTMAN IS
A CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON.

15:04.034 --> 15:06.036
THIS ISN'T HER AREA
OF EXPERTISE.

15:06.036 --> 15:08.908
I KNOW, BUT SHE DID THIS
AMAZING THING FOR ME.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.340
I TRUST HER.

15:10.340 --> 15:13.984
I'D FEEL A WHOLE LOT BETTER
IF I KNEW THAT SHE WAS ON BOARD.

15:16.646 --> 15:18.248
I'VE GOT A CONSULT WAITING.

15:18.248 --> 15:20.190
WE'LL BE QUICK. KAREV.

15:20.190 --> 15:21.451
(clicks)

15:21.451 --> 15:23.453
(Alex)
WE PUT TOGETHER SOME STATS

15:23.453 --> 15:25.996
COMPARING THE SURGICAL OPTIONS
FOR SARAH.

15:25.996 --> 15:28.228
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THIS SLIDE SHOWS

15:28.228 --> 15:29.929
THE DONOR SITE MORBIDITIES

15:29.929 --> 15:33.463
ASSOCIATED WITH USING
SARAH'S OWN SKULL. NEXT SLIDE.

15:33.463 --> 15:35.535
(remote beeps)
AND HERE YOU CAN SEE
THE PROS AND CONS

15:35.535 --> 15:38.508
OF USING SKULL BONE
VERSUS CADAVER BONE.

15:38.508 --> 15:40.670
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE BENEFITS
OF USING CADAVER BONE

15:40.670 --> 15:42.973
ARE REALLY QUITE EXTENSIVE--
TURN THE LIGHTS ON.

15:42.973 --> 15:45.245
WE JUST GOT STARTED.
LIGHTS. NOW.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.516
(click)

15:46.516 --> 15:48.618
MARK, I KNOW WHAT
THE RESEARCH SAYS.

15:48.618 --> 15:52.382
SO THERE'S A CHANCE OF SOME
DONOR GRAFT COMPLICATIONS.

15:52.382 --> 15:54.554
COMPLICATIONS? NO.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.987
YOU, COME HERE.

15:59.629 --> 16:01.431
WE DO YOUR PROCEDURE,

16:01.431 --> 16:04.564
WE'D INCISE HERE
AND HERE.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.067
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
STAND STILL.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.569
THERE'S RISK OF HITTING BRAIN,
CAUSING A HEMATOMA.

16:09.569 --> 16:13.573
OR WE TAKE THE CADAVER ROUTE.
YOU AVOID THAT COMPLETELY,

16:13.573 --> 16:17.077
WHICH MEANS ALL OF THIS...
DOESN'T EVEN GET TOUCHED.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.250
SHE'S A CHILD. AND THAT--
THAT PROCEDURE IS EXPERIMENTAL.

16:20.250 --> 16:23.653
SO AS THE LEAD DOCTOR
ON THIS CASE, LET ME BE CLEAR,

16:23.653 --> 16:26.516
WE'RE DOING THE SURGERY
AS PLANNED.

16:26.516 --> 16:28.258
YOU'RE A CRAPPY LISTENER.

16:28.258 --> 16:29.389
(whistles)

16:29.389 --> 16:31.661
ADD THAT TO THE LIST.
WHAT?

16:31.661 --> 16:33.263
JUST SAYING,

16:33.263 --> 16:37.367
THERE'S MORE WRONG WITH YOU
THAN THE FACT THAT YOU SMOKE.

16:37.367 --> 16:40.130
(door opens)

16:40.130 --> 16:42.132
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE USED
PERMANENT MARKER.

16:42.132 --> 16:45.635
MY APOLOGIES.

16:45.635 --> 16:50.140
(indistinct conversations)

16:50.140 --> 16:52.682
MRS. BURTON.

16:52.682 --> 16:56.516
MRS. HENRY BURTON.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.219
(elevator bell dings)

16:59.219 --> 17:01.421
YOUR HUSBAND REQUESTED
THAT I TALK TO YOU

17:01.421 --> 17:03.323
ABOUT HIS UPCOMING OPERATION.

17:03.323 --> 17:07.157
WE WOULD LIKE
TO REMOVE THE KIDNEY.
WELL, A MAN CAN LIVE
WITHOUT A KIDNEY...

17:07.157 --> 17:10.560
IF THAT'S
YOURRECOMMENDATION.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.303
FUNNY, BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND,

17:13.303 --> 17:16.306
BUT APPARENTLY,
MY RECOMMENDATION

17:16.306 --> 17:19.439
AS CHIEF OF SURGERY,
WITH OVER 30 YEARS

17:19.439 --> 17:23.042
OF GENERAL SURGERY EXPERIENCE
UNDER MY BELT, ISN'T ENOUGH.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.044
HE WOULD LIKE
YOURRECOMMENDATION.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.447
THE RECOMMENDATION
OF ACARDIOSURGEON

17:27.447 --> 17:30.480
WHO HAPPENS TO BE HIS WIFE.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.822
I SEE.

17:36.186 --> 17:39.229
(people speaking indistinctly)

17:39.229 --> 17:41.331
(clears throat)

17:41.331 --> 17:43.363
(clears throat)

17:43.363 --> 17:47.197
YEAH, I AGREE
WITH YOUR RECOMMENDATION.

17:47.197 --> 17:50.100
THERE YOU GO.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.102
(elevator bell dings)

17:52.102 --> 17:54.504
THIS IS A TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE
RELATIONSHIP.

17:54.504 --> 17:57.507
TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.
YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT
INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIPS?

17:57.507 --> 17:59.679
EVERYWHERE I LOOK
IN THIS HOSPITAL,

17:59.679 --> 18:02.081
THERE IS
INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIPS--

18:02.081 --> 18:04.354
GREY AND SHEPHERD,
HUNT AND YANG,

18:04.354 --> 18:07.417
THE OTHER GREY AND SLOAN.

OF PEEING ON STICKS.

18:23.173 --> 18:26.176

IS EXHAUSTING?

BONES WITH STEM CELLS.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.043

THIS SURGERY IS MORE ADVANCED,

21:54.043 --> 21:55.885
AND WOULD DECREASE
THE CHANCE OF COMPLICATIONS

21:55.885 --> 21:58.718
THAT COULD MAKE THE KIND OF
SPORTS THAT SARAH WANTS TO PLAY

21:58.718 --> 22:01.050
OUT OF THE QUESTION.
WELL, IT'S JUST SPORTS, HONEY.

22:01.050 --> 22:03.993
YOU'RE GOOD AT OTHER THINGS.
YOU PAINT. YOU DRAW.

22:03.993 --> 22:06.996

22:12.732 --> 22:14.734
DRAW AND PAINT AND BOWL,

TO PLAY VOLLEYBALL

22:17.707 --> 22:19.809

23:23.132 --> 23:25.435
SORRY ABOUT THAT, SIR.
AH, IT'S FINE.

23:25.435 --> 23:27.837

23:27.837 --> 23:29.539

WOULDN'T YOU SAY,

23:38.117 --> 23:40.550
IT WAS ALWAYS ONE OF
MY BEST QUALITIES.

23:40.550 --> 23:43.122
ALSO, IT'S FUNNY
WHEN THEY FALL DOWN.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.595

A LOOK AT THIS.

over p.a.)

23:55.104 --> 23:56.706

23:56.706 --> 23:59.569
HE'S DOING FINE.
HIS SPINE'S BEEN STABILIZED,

AND, UH,
HE'LL BE AWAKE SOON.

24:01.571 --> 24:03.573
HE'S FINE?
HE'LL BE OKAY?

24:03.573 --> 24:05.715
HIS RECOVERY WILL BE SLOW
AND PAINFUL.

24:05.715 --> 24:07.747
YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED
FOR THAT.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.148
(exhales)

24:09.148 --> 24:12.882
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE BEST DAY OF OUR LIVES.

AND THE... BAGPIPES.

24:27.136 --> 24:29.138

24:29.138 --> 24:32.602
WE DON'T GET MARRIAGE
IN WASHINGTON.

24:32.602 --> 24:35.705
WE GET DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS.

24:35.705 --> 24:38.548
WE GET TO GO TO CITY HALL

24:38.548 --> 24:40.550
AND STAND IN LINE

24:40.550 --> 24:42.952
AND... SIGN SOME PAPERS.

24:42.952 --> 24:47.216
MAIL IT IN
IF YOU'RE EVEN MORE ROMANTIC.

24:47.216 --> 24:49.619
SO CALL ME CRAZY, BUT...

24:51.090 --> 24:55.925
I-I JUST WANTED THE BIG DAY
THAT EVERYBODY ELSE GETS.

24:55.925 --> 24:57.927
AND I FOUGHT FOR IT.

24:57.927 --> 25:00.630
I ORGANIZED RALLIES, I...

25:00.630 --> 25:02.732
STOOD IN THE COLD
OUTSIDE THE STATEHOUSE.

25:02.732 --> 25:05.735
I HAD SOME NEANDERTHAL
THROW HOT COFFEE ON ME.

25:05.735 --> 25:08.037
I FOUGHT FOR A WEDDING

25:08.037 --> 25:09.779
AND WAITED.

25:09.779 --> 25:13.182
AND THEY STILL SAID NO.

25:13.182 --> 25:16.285
SO WHEN WE GOT TIRED
OF WAITING, AND...

25:16.285 --> 25:18.888
BRADY AND I WENT
TO GO SIGN THE PAPERS,

25:18.888 --> 25:20.920
I WANTED IT TO BE SPECIAL.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.928
HE'S THE BEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME,

25:28.928 --> 25:32.161
AND I WANTED IT
TO FEEL LIKE THAT.

25:32.161 --> 25:34.834
NOT LIKE SOME TRIP
TO THE DMV.

25:38.207 --> 25:40.610
I WANTED IT TO BE SPECIAL.

25:43.542 --> 25:47.046

I NEARLY KILLED HIM.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.718
(exhales deeply)

25:51.821 --> 25:55.084
THINGS DON'T GO
THE WAY YOU WANT 'EM TO.

25:56.826 --> 25:59.228
EVER.

25:59.228 --> 26:02.091
EVER.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.335
COME ON.

26:06.335 --> 26:08.067
LET'S GO SEE HIM.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.642
(suction gurgling)

26:12.642 --> 26:14.704
(door opens)

26:14.704 --> 26:16.275
YOU PAGED ME, CHIEF?

26:16.275 --> 26:18.307
WE FOUND A CYST
ON HENRY'S PANCREAS

26:18.307 --> 26:20.710
THAT'S IN DANGER
OF RUPTURING.

26:20.710 --> 26:23.953
REMOVING IT MEANS REMOVING
A LARGE PORTION OF HIS PANCREAS,

26:23.953 --> 26:26.786
WHICH WOULD MAKE HENRY
A DIABETIC.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.818
WE DIDN'T DISCUSS
THAT POSSIBILITY WITH HIM.

26:28.818 --> 26:30.820
OKAY.

26:30.820 --> 26:34.593
WELL, DO YOU THINK THAT'S
SOMETHING HE COULD LIVE WITH?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.195
I DON'T KNOW.

26:36.195 --> 26:39.598
WELL, I HATE TO ASK YOU
ON THE SPOT, DR. ALTMAN,

26:39.598 --> 26:41.971
BUT TECHNICALLY,
YOU ARE THE WIFE.

26:41.971 --> 26:43.873
AND YOU'RE ALSO
HIS EMERGENCY CONTACT PERSON,

26:43.873 --> 26:45.875
SO I AM ASKING YOU,

26:45.875 --> 26:47.877
DO YOU THINK HE HAS
THE SUPPORT SYSTEM

26:47.877 --> 26:49.879
TO MANAGE
A VERY TRICKY DISEASE?

26:52.782 --> 26:54.343
I DON'T KNOW.

26:54.343 --> 26:57.687
IS THERE SOMEONE WE COULD CALL?
A NEXT OF KIN? ANYONE?

26:57.687 --> 26:59.949
I-I DON'T KNOW.
YOU SIGNED
A MARRIAGE LICENSE,

26:59.949 --> 27:02.621
AND YOU HAVEN'T ASKED HIM
THE MOST BASIC QUESTIONS

27:02.621 --> 27:04.623
ON HOW HE WANTS
TO LIVE OR DIE?

27:11.961 --> 27:15.404
DO I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION
TO ACT AS I SEE FIT?

27:15.404 --> 27:17.837
YES.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.369
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:20.369 --> 27:23.012
THAT'S ALL, DR. ALTMAN.

27:23.012 --> 27:26.275
(suction gurgling)

27:37.026 --> 27:39.759
SO...
DID YOU GET MY NOTE?

27:39.759 --> 27:41.430
ELI. (chuckles)

27:41.430 --> 27:43.432
I GUESS YOU GOT MY NOTE.

27:43.432 --> 27:46.265
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

27:46.265 --> 27:49.268
I THINK YOU'RE DIRTY
IS WHAT I THINK.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.901
YOU WANT TO BE DIRTY WITH ME?
SHOW ME THOSE ON-CALL ROOMS

27:51.901 --> 27:54.673
YOU DOCTORS
ARE ALWAYS HAVING SEX IN?
I'M GOING HOME.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.675
MM. MM.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.307
MM.

27:59.949 --> 28:02.681
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND...

28:02.681 --> 28:05.284
(whispers)
I GET OFF IN AN HOUR.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.188
(snickers)

28:11.360 --> 28:13.222
(whispers) WHEW.

28:19.829 --> 28:21.971
(sighs)

28:27.376 --> 28:29.739
I HAVE A PhD.

28:31.440 --> 28:34.944
UM... AFTER COLLEGE,
I GOT A PhD,

28:34.944 --> 28:36.946
AND THEN I WENT
TO MEDICAL SCHOOL,

28:36.946 --> 28:39.318
AND I'M NUMBER ONE
IN MY CLASS.

28:39.318 --> 28:42.922
I KNOW YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT,
BUT I'M NOT.

28:42.922 --> 28:45.324
I-I'VE SEEN THIS STUFF
IN TEXTBOOKS.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.127
I-I'VE JUST N-NEVER SEEN IT
UP CLOSE BEFORE.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.731
(sighs) WHATEVER.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.864
THINK WHAT YOU WANT OF ME.

28:54.864 --> 28:57.867
YOU WANT
TO NOT BE AN IDIOT?

28:57.867 --> 29:00.739

29:09.278 --> 29:12.021
JUST WAIT LONG ENOUGH
UNTIL THE ATTENDING GETS THERE.

29:12.021 --> 29:13.953

ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF YOU.

29:22.391 --> 29:24.063
JUST STOP THINKING

29:24.063 --> 29:25.795
AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

29:25.795 --> 29:27.336

30:49.548 --> 30:52.151
BECAUSE WHO KNOWS
WHAT HE WOULD DO.

30:52.151 --> 30:55.955
HE LEFT A DIRTY NOTE FOR ME
IN A CHART.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.227

WHAT IF THE CHIEF

30:58.227 --> 31:00.629
