WEBVTT

00:02.607 --> 00:04.050
- Pigeon's still here?
- Yeah.

00:04.085 --> 00:05.623
No matter what we do,
he just won't leave.

00:05.658 --> 00:07.358
The problem is you're
thinking like detectives.

00:07.393 --> 00:08.860
- No, I'm definitely not.
- When you should

00:08.895 --> 00:10.446
be thinking like a bird.

00:10.481 --> 00:14.165
- _
- This is Operation: Saving Private Pigeon.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.234
On my mark, I will turn on this fan,

00:16.268 --> 00:18.469
gently startling our bird due east,

00:18.504 --> 00:20.338
into the file box canyon, where he will

00:20.373 --> 00:22.607
encounter Charles holding two pot lids.

00:22.642 --> 00:23.960
He'll bang them together,

00:23.995 --> 00:26.163
forcing Private Pigeon
into the ceiling there

00:26.198 --> 00:27.685
and out of the ceiling there,

00:27.720 --> 00:29.688
where he will be greeted by scary Rosa

00:29.723 --> 00:31.315
holding a scary picture of an owl.

00:31.350 --> 00:32.783
Now he's playing our game.

00:32.974 --> 00:35.319
He'll veer left, into an
upside down garbage can

00:35.354 --> 00:36.580
propped up by a hockey stick

00:36.615 --> 00:38.248
and connected to a string
that Gina is holding.

00:38.457 --> 00:39.690
She pulls it, he is trapped,

00:39.725 --> 00:41.425
and Terry releases him outside.

00:41.460 --> 00:43.752
- Terry hates birds.
- Okay, little friend.

00:43.859 --> 00:45.642
Let's get you home to mama.

00:48.234 --> 00:50.601
Oh, God. It flew right into the fan!

00:50.636 --> 00:53.404
It's everywhere!
There's pigeon everywhere!

01:13.459 --> 01:15.226
- Hey, Boyle.
- Hey, Jake.

01:15.261 --> 01:16.339
- Wait, what?
- Hey, Jake.

01:16.374 --> 01:18.185
Ahh! Bill, what are you doing here?

01:18.220 --> 01:20.254
I thought we agreed to meet only
once a year for the Halloween Heist.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.533
I'm here to deliver
your quarterly NutriBoom shipment.

01:22.568 --> 01:24.569
It comes with both
the amino acid reducer

01:24.604 --> 01:27.030
and extra amino acid,
so you get the perfect balance.

01:27.065 --> 01:29.574
What? No. I only signed up
as a one-time payment bribe.

01:29.609 --> 01:31.976
I'm not selling NutriBoom.
It's clearly a pyramid scheme.

01:32.011 --> 01:34.334
First off, it's not a pyramid scheme.

01:34.369 --> 01:36.113
It's a conical-tiered multi-flow-through

01:36.148 --> 01:37.196
medical marketing entity.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.563
And secondly, you signed the contract.

01:38.851 --> 01:40.484
"Permission to charge my card quarterly

01:40.519 --> 01:42.245
for the next 85 years."

01:42.280 --> 01:44.055
This is written in white
ink on white paper.

01:44.090 --> 01:45.756
They do it that way
so you can't read it.

01:45.791 --> 01:47.558
Well, I did read it
and I'm canceling the contract.

01:47.593 --> 01:49.067
Canceling? If it was that easy
to get out,

01:49.102 --> 01:51.162
would I be here scamming
my closest friends?

01:51.197 --> 01:52.468
We're your closest friends?

01:52.503 --> 01:54.049
What... whatever,
I'm not accepting the shipment.

01:54.084 --> 01:55.833
Jake, piece of advice: just give up.

01:55.868 --> 01:57.702
It's the Boyle way.
It's why our family crest

01:57.737 --> 01:59.270
- is a white flag.
- That reminds me, Charles,

01:59.305 --> 02:00.671
- your shipment's downstairs.
- Great.

02:00.706 --> 02:02.206
- I'll help you bring it up.
- Charles, no.

02:02.241 --> 02:04.208
We're gonna go down to that
office and fight this thing.

02:04.243 --> 02:05.676
I need that money for my honeymoon.

02:05.711 --> 02:07.545
Oh, my God.
The honeymoon is on the line?

02:07.580 --> 02:09.045
- And your money.
- Eh.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.448
Okay, great. Whatever gets you onboard.

02:10.483 --> 02:11.683
- Let's go.
- For the honeymoon

02:11.718 --> 02:12.716
- and no other reason.
- All right.

02:12.985 --> 02:14.185
Sergeant Santiago,

02:14.220 --> 02:16.153
commander of the Nine-Nine's
uniformed officers,

02:16.188 --> 02:18.436
- reporting for duty.
- Hey!

02:18.758 --> 02:21.846
My first order as Sergeant,
tell me I look dope.

02:21.881 --> 02:23.479
- You look dope.
- You won't be abusing

02:23.514 --> 02:25.630
your power like this with the
officers downstairs, will you?

02:25.665 --> 02:27.331
No! No, of course not.

02:27.366 --> 02:28.799
I'm just excited for my first day.

02:28.834 --> 02:30.401
Yes, I remember my first day
as a sergeant.

02:30.436 --> 02:31.669
- I bet.
- My Uncle Geoffrey

02:31.704 --> 02:33.812
was struck by a subway and maimed.

02:34.706 --> 02:36.340
- Oh.
- But the work aspect

02:36.375 --> 02:37.483
was quite exciting.

02:37.518 --> 02:38.809
Are you ready for your first briefing?

02:38.844 --> 02:41.012
Yes, I am fully prepared.

02:41.047 --> 02:43.681
I just wanna establish myself
as a leader right away.

02:43.716 --> 02:46.317
Just be confident, deliberate and firm.

02:46.352 --> 02:47.485
You'll know you have their respect

02:47.520 --> 02:48.959
when you can take a moment...

02:55.528 --> 02:57.339
and still keep their attention.

02:57.563 --> 02:59.530
- Amazing.
- That was captivating as hell.

02:59.565 --> 03:01.165
My recommendation would be
you start with

03:01.200 --> 03:02.400
a small, attainable goal...

03:02.435 --> 03:03.701
something you can accomplish quickly,

03:03.736 --> 03:05.269
perfectly and publicly.

03:05.304 --> 03:08.921
The best way to lead is to
always achieve all your goals.

03:09.909 --> 03:12.243
Cool. That's not a ton of pressure.

03:12.278 --> 03:14.578
Well, it was meant to be. Pressure's
an important part of success.

03:14.613 --> 03:16.714
Just remember, you represent

03:16.749 --> 03:18.788
all Latina policewomen right now.

03:20.173 --> 03:21.105
Thanks.

03:21.454 --> 03:23.245
_

03:23.723 --> 03:26.023
Hello. Welcome to NutriServices.

03:26.058 --> 03:28.492
I'm Angela. How can I heal you today?

03:28.527 --> 03:30.028
Hi, Angela. Creepy greeting.

03:30.063 --> 03:31.530
So not a big deal, there was just

03:31.565 --> 03:34.398
a little bit of a mix-up and we
need to cancel our NutriContracts.

03:34.433 --> 03:36.667
Absolutely. It happens all the time.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.451
All you need to do is sign a few things.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.671
Ah. See, Charles,
that is why you never give up.

03:40.706 --> 03:42.707
- I'll also need $10,000.
- What's that? I'm sorry.

03:42.742 --> 03:44.142
It's payment for the last shipment.

03:44.177 --> 03:45.877
Plus the cancellation fee,
plus the restocking fee

03:45.912 --> 03:48.112
plus something we call
a coward's charge.

03:48.214 --> 03:49.847
And that comes to $10,000.

03:49.882 --> 03:51.349
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

03:51.384 --> 03:53.551
I'll write you a check.
Is gratuity included?

03:53.586 --> 03:54.472
Charles, no.

03:54.507 --> 03:55.874
- Angela...
- Yes? How can I

03:55.909 --> 03:57.254
- heal you today?
- Please stop saying that.

03:57.289 --> 03:58.790
Look, you seem like a perfectly pleasant

03:58.825 --> 03:59.958
robot person, but there's no way

03:59.993 --> 04:01.125
we're giving you any more money.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.627
Ohh. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

04:03.662 --> 04:06.864
For the no payment option,
you just need to sign here.

04:06.899 --> 04:08.566
"Enrollment in NutriCore"?

04:08.601 --> 04:09.967
It's our charity organization.

04:10.002 --> 04:11.736
"Pay off your contracts in labor hours

04:11.771 --> 04:14.572
under the teachings of founder
Docter David Stovelman."

04:14.607 --> 04:16.141
"Docter" is spelled with an E?

04:16.176 --> 04:18.250
- It's the British spelling.
- That can't be right.

04:18.285 --> 04:20.611
All right, look. I didn't
wanna have to do this,

04:20.646 --> 04:22.680
but we're in the NYPD.

04:22.715 --> 04:24.415
And if you don't cooperate,
we'll have no choice

04:24.450 --> 04:25.750
but to file a report
against the company.

04:25.785 --> 04:27.918
You signed a contract,
and that is binding.

04:27.953 --> 04:29.954
No one gets special treatment, Officer.

04:29.989 --> 04:31.522
- Not even Jay.
- Who?

04:31.557 --> 04:33.224
Jay Chandrasekhar,
their celebrity spokesman.

04:33.259 --> 04:34.825
Oh, no way.
The guy from "Super Troopers"?

04:34.860 --> 04:36.627
Yep. He was also in "Beerfest."

04:36.662 --> 04:38.196
Now I have to get back to work,

04:38.231 --> 04:40.965
but allow me to introduce you
to our complaint specialist.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.335
This is Phil. He's been
assigned to intimidate you.

04:44.370 --> 04:45.870
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!

04:45.905 --> 04:47.505
Charles, stop thanking her.

04:49.141 --> 04:51.910
Hello, squad. I am Sergeant Amy Santiago

04:51.945 --> 04:53.812
and I'm your new commanding officer.

04:54.055 --> 04:56.380
I have big plans for us,
but it's always best

04:56.415 --> 04:59.513
to start with something small
and do it perfectly.

04:59.548 --> 05:00.676
So...

05:04.890 --> 05:06.424
Sergeant, I know what
we should start with.

05:06.459 --> 05:09.260
- Oh, I'm sorry, Officer...
- Jennings. Gary Jennings.

05:09.295 --> 05:11.228
Officer Jennings, I already have a plan.

05:11.330 --> 05:12.830
Okay, well, you just paused,
so I thought

05:12.865 --> 05:14.064
you were looking for suggestions,

05:14.099 --> 05:15.299
- which I have a lot of.
- Nope.

05:15.334 --> 05:16.559
Not why I paused.

05:17.069 --> 05:19.603
Anyway, our first order
of business will be

05:19.638 --> 05:22.196
updating the filing system, so...

05:24.910 --> 05:26.577
- We should use barcodes.
- No, no, no, no.

05:26.612 --> 05:27.912
No need to jump in.

05:27.947 --> 05:29.246
I already have a system in mind.

05:29.281 --> 05:30.748
Okay, well you just keep stopping,

05:30.783 --> 05:32.049
- so I thought...
- Ah... to pour water.

05:32.084 --> 05:34.018
- Because I'm thirsty.
- Got it. Great.

05:34.053 --> 05:37.521
Now, let's get into
the details of this with...

05:37.556 --> 05:38.923
Oh, my God! What, Gary?

05:38.958 --> 05:40.834
You're spilling water everywhere.

05:42.912 --> 05:44.213
Yes, I am.

05:44.248 --> 05:46.297
Because our first order of business

05:46.332 --> 05:48.137
is cleaning this floor.

05:48.968 --> 05:50.668
Charles! Charles, come here.

05:50.703 --> 05:51.936
I figured out how to get our money back.

05:51.971 --> 05:53.415
I knew you'd save our honeymoon.

05:53.772 --> 05:54.839
- My honeymoon.
- Whatever.

05:54.874 --> 05:56.140
Yeah, all right, so NutriBoom

05:56.175 --> 05:57.942
is a massive financial scam, right?

05:57.977 --> 05:59.810
If we can prove that, we could
take down the whole company.

05:59.845 --> 06:01.312
Oh, I don't know. Are you
sure you wanna take them on?

06:01.347 --> 06:03.280
They're pretty scary.
I mean, no one's seen

06:03.315 --> 06:04.681
the CEO's wife in years.

06:04.783 --> 06:06.183
People think she's been murdered.

06:06.218 --> 06:07.518
That's just a rumor.
All right, here's the plan:

06:07.620 --> 06:08.819
we infiltrate their headquarters

06:08.854 --> 06:10.287
and get their financial records.

06:10.322 --> 06:11.889
But how do we get in, you ask?

06:11.924 --> 06:13.958
By attending today's meeting
of President's Club

06:13.993 --> 06:15.426
Admiral Level NutriMasters

06:15.461 --> 06:17.094
- at the NutriTower Life Base.
- I don't know,

06:17.129 --> 06:18.662
they know we're cops,
we can't just walk in.

06:18.697 --> 06:20.130
Correct. We can't walk right in,

06:20.165 --> 06:21.932
but we know someone who's a high-level

06:21.967 --> 06:23.467
NutriBoom distributor who can.

06:23.502 --> 06:25.069
And he look exactly like you.

06:25.104 --> 06:26.637
- Hey, guys.
- I don't know.

06:26.739 --> 06:27.838
You really think it'll work?

06:27.873 --> 06:29.073
Charles, it has to.

06:29.108 --> 06:31.609
It's for our honeymoon.

06:31.644 --> 06:33.210
You said "our."

06:36.718 --> 06:39.389
Okay, the meeting
at NutriBoom HQ starts in two hours.

06:39.424 --> 06:40.791
Charles, you're going as Bill

06:40.826 --> 06:42.492
and I'm going as one
of your NutriCruits.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.894
Bill, did you bring
those things I asked for?

06:43.929 --> 06:45.096
Yep, all of my belongings
that you'll need

06:45.131 --> 06:46.732
are in this suitcase.

06:48.837 --> 06:50.871
Why is it vibrating?
Is your cell phone in here?

06:50.906 --> 06:53.588
- No.
- I'm sure it's not a sex toy.

06:53.623 --> 06:54.605
All right, these people
really know Bill,

06:54.640 --> 06:56.206
so you're gonna have to become him.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.574
I can't believe I'm about to say this,

06:57.609 --> 06:59.549
but Bill, tell us all about yourself.

06:59.584 --> 07:01.811
Let's start with
my whole family history.

07:02.129 --> 07:04.130
I was abandoned
at a playground as an infant.

07:04.165 --> 07:05.448
And here I am.

07:05.741 --> 07:07.073
Oh. That was the whole thing.

07:07.327 --> 07:10.020
Well, sad. But easier than remembering
a bunch of names.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.792
Okay, tell us more.

07:11.827 --> 07:13.390
Now, here's a list of all
the nicknames I go by.

07:13.425 --> 07:16.442
Big Bill, Big Eric, Big Drew,
Big Dave, Super Thick...

07:16.477 --> 07:17.894
Just write them all down for us.

07:17.929 --> 07:20.672
And that's why the number
of belly buttons I have is...

07:20.707 --> 07:21.940
- Two.
- One.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.905
- Zero.
- Ahh.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.129
Hello.

07:25.164 --> 07:31.105
- Hello.
- Hello.

07:31.140 --> 07:33.330
That's it. Okay, now
let's work on your wink.

07:34.450 --> 07:35.950
Almost. Now think,

07:36.281 --> 07:40.075
only you and I know
our naughty little secret.

07:40.823 --> 07:42.189
Mmm-hmm.

07:42.374 --> 07:44.141
Okay, I think Boyle's ready.

07:44.176 --> 07:45.328
That's a no-go, Amigo.

07:45.363 --> 07:46.600
If you really wanna pass as me,

07:46.635 --> 07:47.931
you're gonna need to learn my patented

07:47.966 --> 07:49.026
neck massage technique.

07:49.061 --> 07:50.318
I think I've learned enough.

07:50.353 --> 07:51.461
Yeah, I don't really see that coming up.

07:51.496 --> 07:52.888
Thanks for your help, Bill.

07:53.684 --> 07:55.407
So how did your
first briefing go, Sergeant?

07:55.442 --> 07:57.143
Did you give the squad a simple goal?

07:57.178 --> 07:59.208
Mm-hmm. Revamping the filing system.

07:59.243 --> 08:01.414
Mm, smart. Sounds very easy.

08:01.449 --> 08:02.912
- Mm.
- I assume it's been a success?

08:02.947 --> 08:05.542
Oh... Yes. It's been...

08:05.917 --> 08:07.518
all types of successes.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.813
Rousing, resounding...

08:09.848 --> 08:11.615
smashing.

08:11.650 --> 08:14.439
Oh, it's good to hear.
Remember, failure...

08:15.020 --> 08:16.119
is for failures.

08:16.334 --> 08:17.674
Good thing I'm not a failure.

08:19.450 --> 08:21.655
Guys, I lied. My briefing
was a total failure.

08:21.690 --> 08:23.026
But you told Captain Holt it went great

08:23.061 --> 08:24.675
in such a normal way.

08:24.710 --> 08:26.177
I'm a terrible manager.

08:26.212 --> 08:28.761
I've got this super eager
know-it-all on my squad

08:28.796 --> 08:30.606
who keeps derailing
me with all his ideas

08:30.641 --> 08:31.866
and I can't get anything done.

08:31.901 --> 08:33.292
Aww, you got an Amy.

08:33.327 --> 08:34.886
- Oh, she's got an Amy.
- It's pretty normal.

08:34.922 --> 08:36.222
Yeah, she got one of her, right?

08:36.256 --> 08:37.590
Like a pet. Takes one to know one,

08:37.625 --> 08:39.859
- I guess.
- No, he is not an Amy.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.361
I am nothing like Gary.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.962
Uhh, first of all, Gary and Amy

08:42.996 --> 08:44.964
- are the exact same name.
- Let me ask you this:

08:45.066 --> 08:47.000
did he already send you
nine follow-up emails

08:47.035 --> 08:48.691
- about the briefing?
- No.

08:49.449 --> 08:50.904
- It was 30.
- You got an Amy.

08:50.939 --> 08:53.974
Guys, I think I would know
if my Gary was an Amy.

08:55.214 --> 08:56.509
- Hey, Gary. What you reading?
- The new issue

08:56.544 --> 08:57.778
of "Stationary Monthly."

08:57.813 --> 08:58.950
Yeah, I have an Amy.

08:58.985 --> 09:00.413
_

09:00.448 --> 09:01.915
Bill. Is that you?

09:01.950 --> 09:05.533
Yes, it's me, Bill. Hello.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.220
- You seem different.
- Nope.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.101
I'm still the same old Bill Hummertrout

09:09.136 --> 09:10.890
who grew up in Bean Station, Tennessee

09:10.925 --> 09:12.032
and shaves his armpits.

09:12.067 --> 09:13.927
Anyway, meet the new recruit
I signed up.

09:13.962 --> 09:15.395
New NutriCruit? Boom, boom!

09:15.430 --> 09:17.263
Boom, boom. My name is Barry St. Barry.

09:17.298 --> 09:20.166
And I can't wait to get inside
and unlock my NutriFuture.

09:20.201 --> 09:21.734
Let me... let me in! Let me in!

09:21.769 --> 09:23.003
I love your energy. Boom, boom!

09:23.038 --> 09:25.606
I love your energy. Boom, boom!

09:25.641 --> 09:27.652
Okay, get up there.

09:28.076 --> 09:30.243
Man, everybody here is so creepy.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.565
Yeah. Is that Hitchcock and Scully?

09:33.014 --> 09:35.448
- Boom, boom, Bill!
- Boom, boom!

09:35.483 --> 09:36.616
Yeah, that tracks.

09:36.651 --> 09:38.184
All right, let's get a move on.

09:38.219 --> 09:39.686
The longer I stay here,
the more horrified I get.

09:39.721 --> 09:40.954
I know. Have you seen all these posters

09:40.989 --> 09:42.796
of David Stovelman's wife, Debby?

09:43.124 --> 09:45.091
"I'm happy healthy and alive."

09:45.126 --> 09:47.227
- Oh, Debbie dead.
- Debbie real dead.

09:47.262 --> 09:48.761
All right, Bill said that the offices

09:48.796 --> 09:50.063
are behind that roped-off area.

09:50.098 --> 09:51.564
We're gonna need a distraction.

09:51.599 --> 09:53.299
Well, if I know cults,
this meeting will start

09:53.334 --> 09:55.368
with an insanely over-the-top
nonsense video.

09:55.403 --> 09:56.937
- Huh.
<i>- Hello, Admirals.</i>

09:56.972 --> 09:58.472
<i>Please turn your eyes to the monitors</i>

09:58.507 --> 10:00.507
<i>for a special hello
from NutriBoom elite,</i>

10:00.542 --> 10:01.508
<i>Jay Chandrasekhar.</i>

10:01.543 --> 10:03.443
<i>Boom, boom, everybody!</i>

10:03.478 --> 10:05.212
Boom, boom, Jay!

10:05.247 --> 10:06.714
- And there's our distraction.
<i>- When I first met</i>

10:06.749 --> 10:08.250
<i>Docter David Stovelman,</i>

10:08.285 --> 10:10.984
<i>I had no idea my amino acids
could be so high</i>

10:11.019 --> 10:12.934
<i>or so low.</i>

10:13.421 --> 10:14.954
Ugh, guys.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.990
Gary is killing my productivity.

10:17.025 --> 10:19.425
Terry, how did you used to deal
with having an Amy?

10:19.460 --> 10:21.761
I didn't have to do anything.
You've always been great.

10:21.796 --> 10:23.296
Cut the crap, Terry. I'm drowning.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.565
Fine. When you got
too difficult to deal with,

10:25.600 --> 10:26.729
I'd pull rank.

10:26.966 --> 10:29.169
- Did that work?
- No. Not even once.

10:29.204 --> 10:30.837
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

10:30.872 --> 10:32.105
Well, you could always
just wait for Gary

10:32.140 --> 10:33.607
to find his Jake and then eventually,

10:33.642 --> 10:35.810
over time, they'll each become
10% easier to deal with.

10:35.845 --> 10:37.378
Gary will never find love.

10:37.413 --> 10:38.746
He is unlovable.

10:38.781 --> 10:40.415
- Gina, what do I do?
- No, I don't know

10:40.450 --> 10:41.583
how to deal with an Amy.

10:41.618 --> 10:45.051
But there is this girl Wanda
in my Mommy & Me class.

10:45.086 --> 10:47.954
She's such a pill.
She's so into her baby

10:47.989 --> 10:49.989
and not into the other babies
and it's like,

10:50.024 --> 10:51.257
oh, cool, well, congrats.

10:51.292 --> 10:52.793
Your baby rolled over early.

10:52.828 --> 10:54.229
- Like, who cares?
- I don't have time

10:54.264 --> 10:56.766
- for this, Gina.
- And that is how

10:56.801 --> 10:58.235
you deal with an Amy.

10:58.270 --> 10:59.970
You talk about something
she's not interested in

11:00.005 --> 11:03.349
- until she walks away.
- Ohh, brilliant.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.505
Stupid cult.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.907
They labeled their financial
records "financial records."

11:07.942 --> 11:09.156
Dummies.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.145
Uh-oh, Jake. We got a NutriBoomer

11:12.180 --> 11:13.479
approaching at 12:00.

11:13.514 --> 11:14.804
The file just started downloading.

11:14.839 --> 11:16.073
- How much time do we have?
- I don't know,

11:16.108 --> 11:17.440
- but he's a polka dotter.
- Polka Dotter...

11:17.475 --> 11:19.310
- what does that mean?
- Of the eight types of walkers?

11:19.345 --> 11:21.111
Polka dotters, drivers, arm swingers,

11:21.146 --> 11:22.647
stompers... you don't know about this?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.964
Nobody does, Charles. You clearly
just read some weird blog post.

11:24.999 --> 11:27.192
First of all, Popmango.com
is not a weird blog.

11:27.227 --> 11:28.227
It's infotainment.

11:28.262 --> 11:29.562
Secondly, polka dot walkers

11:29.597 --> 11:30.683
take short strides on their toes.

11:30.718 --> 11:32.194
I don't wanna learn
about polka dotters right now.

11:32.229 --> 11:33.163
Just get out there and stall him.

11:33.198 --> 11:34.130
But... gah!

11:34.514 --> 11:36.636
Hello, bud. Boom, boom.

11:36.671 --> 11:38.138
Boom, boom. Bill.

11:38.173 --> 11:39.306
What are you doing back here?

11:39.341 --> 11:40.908
This floor's closed on the weekend.

11:40.943 --> 11:42.809
You know me, just gotta stretch my legs.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.344
I'm really sore from Pilates.

11:44.379 --> 11:46.045
But NutriBoom doesn't allow Pilates.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.513
It's a pseudoscience.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.783
Right, no. Pilates is the name of my

11:50.818 --> 11:52.485
most recent sexual partner.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.620
Boom, boom!

11:53.655 --> 11:55.288
Boom, boom. You seem off, man.

11:55.323 --> 11:57.190
Your voice is different,
you're not sucking on

11:57.225 --> 11:59.108
- your signature lollipop.
- Right.

11:59.779 --> 12:01.961
I guess I just woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

12:01.996 --> 12:03.529
Since when do you sleep in a bed?

12:03.564 --> 12:04.731
Why are you being so weird?

12:04.766 --> 12:06.056
What are you doing back here?

12:06.230 --> 12:07.729
I know what's going on.

12:08.236 --> 12:10.570
You're fishing for one of
my patented neck massages,

12:10.605 --> 12:11.488
aren't you?

12:11.919 --> 12:14.440
- There's the Bill I know.
- Present and accounted for.

12:14.475 --> 12:17.637
Now turn around and gimme me that neck.

12:19.247 --> 12:20.713
You're not gonna do it from the front?

12:20.748 --> 12:23.537
Well, of course. I mean,
that's how I do it.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.289
Oh, that's the good stuff. Boom, boom.

12:29.324 --> 12:30.423
Boom, boom.

12:32.927 --> 12:34.690
Hey, where's my eye contact?

12:37.231 --> 12:38.298
I got the files.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.832
I told you it would work.

12:39.867 --> 12:42.567
- Wait, what's wrong?
- They formed a line, Jake.

12:43.601 --> 12:45.200
They formed a line.

12:48.637 --> 12:51.685
Ugh... No evidence of wrong
doing in any of these files.

12:51.891 --> 12:53.190
Credit where credit is due,

12:53.225 --> 12:54.792
NutriBoom is good at criminal activity.

12:54.827 --> 12:56.460
Well, they're terrible at making shakes.

12:56.495 --> 12:59.364
Right? The only listed ingredient
is "foreign substance."

12:59.400 --> 13:02.244
And the flavor is called
"Almost Cherry."

13:02.402 --> 13:03.935
And I can't stop drinking it.

13:03.971 --> 13:06.302
This is interesting.
There's a major transaction

13:06.338 --> 13:07.670
- on June 10th.
- My dad's birthday!

13:07.706 --> 13:09.206
You really think that's what I thought

13:09.241 --> 13:10.641
- was interesting about it?
- I don't know.

13:10.676 --> 13:12.476
It's a payment for
100 grand to ScepterCore.

13:12.512 --> 13:14.445
Isn't that one of those
black ops security firms

13:14.481 --> 13:16.346
- that ex-SEALs worked for?
- Yes, it is.

13:16.382 --> 13:18.082
- And on June 10th...
- My dad's birthday.

13:18.117 --> 13:20.279
Are you just trying to get me to
remember your dad's birthday now?

13:20.315 --> 13:21.287
I mean, it wouldn't kill you to call.

13:21.323 --> 13:22.683
We don't have time to talk about this.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.653
Your dad's birthday is the same day

13:24.689 --> 13:26.323
that Debbie Stovelman
went missing last year.

13:26.358 --> 13:27.992
I bet the payment is a paper trail

13:28.027 --> 13:30.094
for the hit Stovelman
took out on his wife.

13:30.129 --> 13:31.595
This just became a murder case.

13:31.630 --> 13:33.597
Maybe, but it's not enough
to open an investigation.

13:33.632 --> 13:35.833
Right, but it is enough
to make Stovelman nervous.

13:35.868 --> 13:37.480
- We just have to get to him.
- Oh, no.

13:37.836 --> 13:39.136
Do I have to go as Bill again?

13:39.171 --> 13:40.337
No, don't worry. He isn't big enough

13:40.372 --> 13:41.939
to earn face time with the founder.

13:41.975 --> 13:43.589
We have to take this
to the highest level.

13:44.143 --> 13:45.771
Jay Chandrasekhar!

13:46.912 --> 13:48.345
Hey, Gina. Thanks for nothin'!

13:48.380 --> 13:50.681
- Oh, you're welcome.
- I said, for nothin'.

13:50.716 --> 13:52.683
Your boring story didn't work.

13:52.718 --> 13:55.986
So my friend Wanda,
she just loves the oceans.

13:56.088 --> 13:58.889
The Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian...

13:58.924 --> 14:01.892
Ooh, ooh! What is her take on straits?

14:01.927 --> 14:03.405
Because I love the Bering.

14:03.662 --> 14:06.196
We talked about
bodies of water for hours.

14:06.231 --> 14:08.933
Damn, the Force is strong with this Amy.

14:08.968 --> 14:10.200
Look, I wasn't gonna tell you this,

14:10.235 --> 14:11.702
but you should just do what I used to do

14:11.737 --> 14:13.470
- when I needed to escape you.
- What did you do?

14:13.505 --> 14:15.306
Literally escape you.
Always be on the move.

14:15.341 --> 14:16.607
Never be static. Like a shark.

14:16.642 --> 14:18.075
That way he can't catch your attention.

14:18.110 --> 14:20.277
That's right! That is what we did.

14:20.312 --> 14:22.012
- But you all did that?
- Mm-hmm.

14:22.047 --> 14:24.048
Okay, but Rosa, how did you...

14:24.083 --> 14:26.197
Rosa? W-where did she...

14:26.952 --> 14:29.350
Damn, you guys are good.

14:30.022 --> 14:32.156
There he is. How did you know
he'd be at this coffee shop?

14:32.191 --> 14:34.391
"US Weekly." He's pictured
here all the time.

14:34.493 --> 14:35.993
He's coming out. All right, look,

14:36.028 --> 14:37.160
this guy is into NutriBoom pretty deep.

14:37.262 --> 14:39.563
But if we apply enough pressure,
we may get him to crack.

14:39.598 --> 14:40.631
Copy that.

14:40.666 --> 14:41.898
Hi, excuse me.

14:42.001 --> 14:43.434
Mr. Chandrasekhar,
we wanted to talk to you

14:43.469 --> 14:45.035
- about NutriBoom.
- All right!

14:45.070 --> 14:46.804
- Boom, boom, guys.
- Boom, boom!

14:46.839 --> 14:49.106
- We're with the NYPD.
- Oh, my God. Seriously?

14:49.141 --> 14:50.161
You guys have to save me.

14:50.197 --> 14:51.308
- Can you get me out?
- What's that now?

14:51.344 --> 14:52.879
NutriBoom is a scam and a cult.

14:52.915 --> 14:54.345
- They've ruined my life.
- Really?

14:54.380 --> 14:55.913
You look so happy in the videos.

14:55.949 --> 14:57.744
You'd pretend to be happy too
if you knew what they did to me.

14:57.780 --> 14:59.649
- Testicular torture?
- Yeah.

14:59.752 --> 15:01.051
- Ohh.
- Look,

15:01.086 --> 15:02.619
we have reason to believe
David Stovelman

15:02.654 --> 15:03.787
murdered his wife, Debbie.

15:03.822 --> 15:05.089
- Yeah, duh!
- All right, Jay.

15:05.124 --> 15:06.523
- Try to remain calm, here.
- Sorry.

15:06.558 --> 15:08.025
- I'm just so scarred.
- Right,

15:08.061 --> 15:09.427
from the nard torture.

15:09.463 --> 15:11.196
Look, we have evidence
that could tie David

15:11.232 --> 15:12.966
to his wife's death,
but we need your help

15:13.002 --> 15:14.859
- to get to him.
- Yeah, I'll do whatever you want.

15:14.895 --> 15:16.381
You have no idea how terrible they are.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.335
Trust me, I do.
They took ten grand from me.

15:18.436 --> 15:20.136
Boo-hoo, they kidnapped my dog.

15:20.172 --> 15:21.572
Okay, well, no need to compare stakes.

15:21.607 --> 15:23.407
Although I doubt your dog cost $10,000.

15:23.442 --> 15:24.808
You can't put a price on life.

15:24.843 --> 15:26.894
You're absolutely right. Thank
you so much for your help, sir.

15:27.913 --> 15:29.079
- Sergeant?
- Aah!

15:29.114 --> 15:30.214
I need to tell you something.

15:30.249 --> 15:31.648
Great. Can't wait to hear it.

15:31.683 --> 15:33.350
First, could you pass
that thing over there?

15:33.385 --> 15:35.724
Sure, yes. Oh, what thing? I don't...

15:36.972 --> 15:38.040
Sergeant?

15:38.424 --> 15:40.171
- Sergeant!
- Oh, hey.

15:43.430 --> 15:44.755
Sergeant?

15:45.863 --> 15:47.013
Sergeant?

15:52.237 --> 15:53.622
Okay.

15:54.206 --> 15:56.767
Let's finally get these shelves up.

15:58.031 --> 16:00.265
Goes perfect.

16:00.879 --> 16:02.647
Ohh! Oh, no.

16:02.769 --> 16:04.469
Oh, there you are.

16:04.716 --> 16:07.151
I was trying to tell you
not to use that wall.

16:07.186 --> 16:08.737
It has water damage.

16:09.715 --> 16:10.760
Noted.

16:11.523 --> 16:14.324
So Stovelman will pick up Jay
and take him to lunch.

16:14.426 --> 16:16.160
We trail them, and then
when they get comfortable,

16:16.195 --> 16:17.828
ambush 'em with the intel
about his wife.

16:17.863 --> 16:20.764
Wow. I can't believe we're
working a sting operation

16:20.799 --> 16:22.199
- with a celebrity.
- I know.

16:22.234 --> 16:23.634
I feel like we're in "Oceans 11."

16:23.669 --> 16:24.701
You're such a Clooney.

16:24.736 --> 16:26.403
- Ooh, and I'm Elliot Gould.
- Wow.

16:26.438 --> 16:28.628
Just skipped right over
Pitt and Damon, huh?

16:29.241 --> 16:30.674
- I've been good!
- Oh, no!

16:30.709 --> 16:32.743
- Those are NutriCore guys.
- They're taking Jay!

16:32.778 --> 16:34.777
It's not a pick up. It's a throw in.

16:35.347 --> 16:36.847
- Where's Jay?
- Hey, Bill.

16:36.882 --> 16:38.282
- Boom, boom!
- No boom, boom.

16:38.317 --> 16:40.350
- I am not Bill.
- Look, we're with the NYPD.

16:40.452 --> 16:43.053
We saw two NutriCore thugs
kidnap Jay and bring him here.

16:43.088 --> 16:44.855
- Now where is he?
- Bill, you're a cop!

16:44.890 --> 16:46.890
- No, I am not Bill!
- If you don't cooperate,

16:46.925 --> 16:48.725
we'll consider you an accessory
to this crime.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.227
I don't know what you mean by crime.

16:50.262 --> 16:51.528
Jay's just voluntarily hanging out with

16:51.563 --> 16:53.397
some nutrition
specialists in the basement.

16:53.432 --> 16:55.165
You can see for yourself
if you'd like, Bill.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.867
I will see for myself,
but I am not Bill.

16:56.902 --> 16:58.135
- Good one, Bill.
- Oh!

16:58.170 --> 16:59.188
Get out of here.

16:59.605 --> 17:02.372
- Jay! Oh, my God.
- Boom, boom, guys!

17:02.407 --> 17:04.273
What? We saw them take you.
Are you okay?

17:04.309 --> 17:05.843
What are you talking about?

17:05.877 --> 17:08.345
- Oh, the van thing?
- Yeah, Jay. The van thing.

17:08.380 --> 17:09.847
Those are just my friends
from NutriBoom.

17:09.882 --> 17:11.647
They were worried about
my amino acid levels,

17:11.683 --> 17:14.512
so they rushed me straight here
to give me more or less of them.

17:14.549 --> 17:15.886
Why are you talking like that?

17:15.921 --> 17:16.958
What did they do to you?

17:17.222 --> 17:18.255
Oh, I see.

17:18.290 --> 17:19.263
They gave you back your dog.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.924
No, they found my dog.

17:20.959 --> 17:23.093
He was wandering around a park
for a year.

17:23.127 --> 17:25.028
Come on, man. Pull it together.

17:25.063 --> 17:26.363
These people are evil, remember?

17:26.397 --> 17:28.031
David Stovelman murdered his wife.

17:28.067 --> 17:29.392
You mean me?

17:29.428 --> 17:32.295
- Debbie Stovelman.
- Boom, boom.

17:32.437 --> 17:34.871
She is happy, healthy and alive.

17:39.154 --> 17:41.263
Hey, Captain. Just wanted to say

17:41.298 --> 17:42.723
sorry about the hole in the wall.

17:42.758 --> 17:44.158
I've already called maintenance.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.659
- Okay. Anything else?
- God, you're good.

17:45.694 --> 17:46.994
You saw right through me.

17:47.029 --> 17:48.233
I failed as a manager.

17:48.269 --> 17:51.465
I couldn't deal with this overeager
officer who kept pestering me.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.267
- Ohh, you have an...
- Amy.

17:53.302 --> 17:55.436
Yes, I know. We've been
through it a lot today.

17:55.471 --> 17:57.037
Well, you should've come to me.

17:57.274 --> 17:58.708
I know exactly what it's like to be you.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.940
You used to be an Amy?

17:59.975 --> 18:02.203
No, I never had your level
of insecurity.

18:02.239 --> 18:04.048
I was referring to managing an Amy.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.547
Of course. Well, I'm not sure
there's anything left to try.

18:06.582 --> 18:07.848
No matter what I did,

18:07.883 --> 18:09.517
he just kept interrupting me

18:09.552 --> 18:10.918
with all his own ideas.

18:10.953 --> 18:12.152
- Were they good ideas?
- I don't know.

18:12.187 --> 18:13.551
I didn't listen to them.

18:14.264 --> 18:15.530
Damn.

18:15.566 --> 18:17.015
Did you just solve it that easily?

18:17.051 --> 18:20.668
Yes, I did. You see, managing Amy
is not a chore, it's a pleasure.

18:20.704 --> 18:22.696
- Because an Amy is a tool.
- I'm a tool?

18:22.731 --> 18:24.460
Yes, you're a massive tool.

18:24.532 --> 18:26.299
You're useful and valuable.

18:26.335 --> 18:28.663
Sure, an Amy can be
intimidating sometimes

18:28.699 --> 18:30.433
because they have such strong ideas.

18:30.469 --> 18:32.569
But you should always listen to an Amy

18:32.605 --> 18:34.341
because they will only make you better.

18:34.729 --> 18:37.854
At least, that's my experience.

18:38.995 --> 18:40.100
Thank you, sir.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.880
<i>Jay, would you please excuse us.</i>

18:42.916 --> 18:44.616
I believe there's a brand new motorcycle

18:44.652 --> 18:46.085
with your name on it upstairs.

18:46.121 --> 18:47.654
You guys are the best.

18:47.689 --> 18:49.423
Thanks for bringing my dog back.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.124
He looks almost exactly the same.

18:51.159 --> 18:52.893
- Come on.
- Boom, boom, Jake.

18:52.928 --> 18:54.962
- Boom, boom, Charles.
- Boom, boom, Jay.

18:54.997 --> 18:55.996
What's going on here?

18:56.031 --> 18:57.964
- I thought you were murdered.
- I was never dead.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.467
Then what was that 100k
payment to ScepterCore for?

19:00.714 --> 19:02.369
It was to get you off the grid.

19:02.404 --> 19:04.171
Because the Feds were investigating you.

19:04.206 --> 19:06.106
You can't indict someone
who doesn't exist.

19:06.141 --> 19:07.407
So you're still working for NutriBoom?

19:07.442 --> 19:09.977
Working for? I am NutriBoom.

19:10.302 --> 19:12.980
Look, your annoying little
crusade is wasting my time.

19:13.015 --> 19:15.415
I want you to leave me
and my company alone.

19:15.450 --> 19:17.251
Not gonna happen.
Now we know you're alive

19:17.286 --> 19:18.518
and I bet the Feds would be interested

19:18.554 --> 19:19.720
- in knowing that, too.
- Maybe,

19:19.756 --> 19:20.689
but the fact remains,

19:20.725 --> 19:22.292
I haven't committed any crimes...

19:22.391 --> 19:23.590
that anyone can prove.

19:23.625 --> 19:25.425
So you can try your luck with the Feds.

19:25.460 --> 19:26.927
Or you can get your money back and go on

19:26.962 --> 19:28.228
that expensive honeymoon.

19:28.263 --> 19:29.529
How do you know about my honeymoon?

19:29.564 --> 19:31.486
- I know everything.
- Oh, really?

19:31.522 --> 19:34.273
Because you don't know about
my big ass moral compass.

19:35.646 --> 19:36.982
Damn!

19:37.940 --> 19:40.693
I'm going to the Feds,
and you're going down.

19:42.077 --> 19:43.610
Also, can you tell us
how to get out of here?

19:43.646 --> 19:45.378
This place is a real maze.

19:46.148 --> 19:47.381
Oh, Officer Jennings?

19:47.416 --> 19:48.548
Can I speak to you for a minute?

19:48.583 --> 19:49.750
Of course. Nothing I like more

19:49.785 --> 19:51.218
than one-on-one time with my boss.

19:51.253 --> 19:52.853
Wow, it's like staring in a mirror.

19:52.888 --> 19:54.254
- What?
- Nothing.

19:54.289 --> 19:55.923
Listen, I wanna apologize.

19:55.958 --> 19:59.293
I ignored your ideas
and that was a mistake.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.894
Please, tell me your suggestions

20:00.929 --> 20:02.362
- for the filing system.
- It's actually

20:02.397 --> 20:04.731
five suggestions and 23 sub suggestions.

20:04.766 --> 20:06.566
- And I...
- After the briefing.

20:06.601 --> 20:08.790
Ohh. Copy that.

20:09.379 --> 20:10.837
All right, listen up, squad.

20:10.872 --> 20:12.539
We had increased criminal activity

20:12.574 --> 20:13.840
in the park last night, so we'll be

20:13.875 --> 20:15.509
doubling our patrols there today.

20:15.544 --> 20:18.648
After the meeting,
I will be handing out new...

20:24.453 --> 20:25.785
assignments.

20:27.155 --> 20:28.675
Oh, my God, I did it.

20:29.533 --> 20:31.191
The Feds said our intel could help them

20:31.226 --> 20:32.592
maybe take down Stovelman someday,

20:32.627 --> 20:35.095
- but they didn't sound hopeful.
- Well, I'm glad

20:35.130 --> 20:36.363
- you did the right thing.
- Really?

20:36.398 --> 20:37.798
Even though it means
we now have no money

20:37.833 --> 20:39.433
- for a decent honeymoon?
- It's hard not to

20:39.468 --> 20:40.867
say a really corny thing right now

20:40.902 --> 20:42.669
about how every day's
a honeymoon with you.

20:42.704 --> 20:45.138
Aww. Although, technically,
you did you just say it.

20:45.173 --> 20:46.967
Which is very embarrassing for you.

20:49.264 --> 20:50.631
Jake, don't freak out.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.934
There's a really creepy guy
spying on us.

20:53.148 --> 20:54.715
Oh, no, no, no.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.416
That's just Phil from NutraBoom.

20:56.451 --> 20:57.993
He'll be intimidating us from now on.

20:58.028 --> 21:00.820
There's an evil corporation
hell-bent on destroying us.

21:00.856 --> 21:02.682
Hi, Phil! Boom, boom!

21:03.333 --> 21:04.833
Say, "Boom, boom," darling.

21:04.868 --> 21:05.800
Boom, boom.
