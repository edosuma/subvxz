07:16.000 --> 07:17.208

07:17.250 --> 07:20.041

SOMETHING CALLED PICA.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.750

YEAH.

07:22.792 --> 07:25.250

MAKES YOU PRETTY SPECIAL.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.041

FOR THE STOMACHACHE.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.250

A MOUTH FULL OF SPLINTERS,

07:58.291 --> 08:02.041
AND YOU'RE MISSING A BOX OF
TONGUE DEPRESSORS, IT'S PICA.
(chuckles)
IT'S NOT REALLY THAT SIMPLE.

08:02.083 --> 08:04.125
I MEAN, THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR
COULD BE O.C.D.

08:04.166 --> 08:07.375
OR A NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCY,
NEUROLOGICAL OR TRAUMA RESPONSE.

08:07.417 --> 08:10.625
I MEAN, SOMETIMES,
WE NEVER FIGURE IT OUT.
WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU
A HEAD START.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.625

A NEW STEPFATHER.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.625
THE PROBLEM STARTED
AROUND THE SAME TIME.

08:14.667 --> 08:17.625
THE STEPFATHER'S SOLUTION IS TO
LOCK A HOCKEY MASK ON HIS FACE.

08:17.667 --> 08:20.709
I WAS GONNA TALK TO VIOLET ABOUT
IT, BUT IT'S HER FIRST DAY BACK.

08:20.750 --> 08:24.041
I DON'T WANNA...
COULD YOU SEE HIM?
SURE, SURE.
I'M HAPPY TO BE SECOND CHOICE.

SHELDON IS THOROUGH,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.166
BUT NEXT TIME
I GO OUT OF TOWN,

08:41.208 --> 08:44.000

COVER MY PATIENTS

08:46.041 --> 08:47.458

YEAH,

I'M GOOD. CAN'T I BE GOOD?

09:06.709 --> 09:09.041

09:32.750 --> 09:36.375

PROFESSIONAL DISTANCE.

09:55.083 --> 09:58.041
(Addison) LUCIA... I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT CARL.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.041
BUT IF THERE IS A PROBLEM
WITH HIS HEART,

10:00.083 --> 10:02.291
DR. BENNETT WILL FIND IT.
I HOPE SO.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.208
HE'S THE BEST.
NO, I MEAN, I HOPE HE WILL...

10:05.250 --> 10:07.083
FIND SOMETHING WRONG.

10:07.125 --> 10:09.750
(voice breaking) THIS IS
HIS FOURTH TOUR OF DUTY.

10:09.792 --> 10:11.041
WHEN I HEAR ON THE NEWS

10:11.083 --> 10:14.041
THAT A ROADSIDE BOMB WENT OFF
KILLING SIX,

10:14.083 --> 10:17.083
I WONDER IF ONE OF THEM
WAS CARL.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.542
WHEN OFFICERS COME AROUND,

10:18.583 --> 10:21.417
I PRAY THAT
THEY DON'T STOP BY MY HOUSE.

10:21.458 --> 10:24.333
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I'M WAITING FOR HIM TO DIE.

10:24.375 --> 10:27.917
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO.

10:27.959 --> 10:31.125
IF YOU COULD FIND SOMETHING
OR SAY THERE'S SOMETHING,

10:31.166 --> 10:34.125
SOMETHING THAT MEANS HE CAN'T
GO BACK TO IRAQ AT ALL...

10:34.166 --> 10:38.083
I LOVE HIM.
HELP ME KEEP HIM ALIVE.

10:43.917 --> 10:45.750
HEY.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
ARE THOSE, UH,
CARL'S CARDIAC C.T.s?

10:55.041 --> 10:57.834
SO WHAT, ARE YOU NOT
TALKING TO ME NOW EITHER?

10:57.875 --> 11:00.583
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? I REALLY
CAN'T HANDLE THAT TODAY, SAM.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.041
SO BE A GROWN-UP.
USE YOUR WORDS.
VANESSA AND I BROKE UP.

11:03.083 --> 11:06.041
OH. I'M SORRY.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.333
I AM. I KNOW THAT WE DIDN'T
ALWAYS GET ALONG--

11:08.375 --> 11:11.041
YOU HATED HER. YOU HATED
THAT I WAS WITH HER.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.041
SO DON'T SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

11:13.083 --> 11:15.041
IT'S A LIE. YOU KNOW IT,
AND I KNOW IT.

11:15.083 --> 11:18.041
SEE... YOU WANT TO HAVE
YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT, TOO.

11:18.083 --> 11:21.041
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN'T,
BECAUSE I'M THE CAKE.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.625
AND FROM HERE ON OUT,
I'M TAKING THE CAKE AWAY.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.041
NO MORE CAKE FOR YOU.
I'M GOOD CAKE, TOO.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.750
DOUBLE CHOCOLATE, CREAM-FILLED

11:27.792 --> 11:29.792

11:29.834 --> 11:32.834
SO NO MORE CAKE FOR YOU.
SO JUST SHUT UP.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.125
OKAY.

11:34.166 --> 11:37.041
CARL HAS A BLOCK IN HIS L.A.D.
IT'S CALLED A WIDOWMAKER.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.041
WE'RE LUCKY WE FOUND IT.
COULDA KILLED HIM.

11:39.083 --> 11:43.041
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
WELL, HE'S A PERFECT CANDIDATE
FOR A STENT.

11:43.083 --> 11:45.166
AFTER THE PROCEDURE,
HE SHOULD BE GOOD AS NEW.

11:45.208 --> 11:46.959
MAYBE DRUG THERAPY
WOULD WORK.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.125
WAIT. THE KID'S SERVING
IN A WAR ZONE, ADDISON.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.875
YOU WANT TO SLOW DOWN
HIS HEART, HIS ENTIRE SYSTEM?

11:51.917 --> 11:54.041
YOU KNOW,
DO YOU THINK HE CAN PERFORM

11:54.083 --> 11:56.041
TO THE LEVEL HE NEEDS TO
ON--ON BETA-BLOCKERS?

11:56.083 --> 11:58.250
PROBABLY NOT.
HE'D BE DISCHARGED.

11:58.291 --> 12:01.375
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT ME
TO DO SOMETHING LESS EFFECTIVE

12:01.417 --> 12:04.500
SO THAT THEY'LL PULL HIM
OUT OF MILITARY SERVICE?
THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME, SAM.

12:04.542 --> 12:07.625
LUCIA'S GONNA HAVE HIS BABY.
SHE WANTS TO KEEP HIM AROUND.

12:07.667 --> 12:11.041
WELL, YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET
WHAT YOU WANT.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.041
UGH.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.834

12:17.625 --> 12:19.041
(Lucia) I DON'T KNOW.

12:19.083 --> 12:21.875
SURGERY SOUNDS RISKY.

12:21.917 --> 12:24.041
BUT IF I TAKE THE MEDICATION,
I CAN'T GO BACK?

12:24.083 --> 12:25.583
I CAN'T MAKE
THAT DETERMINATION,

12:25.625 --> 12:28.291
BUT WILL IT HAVE AN AFFECT
ON YOUR PERFORMANCE? IT MIGHT.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.291
BUT, HONEY,
IF YOU'RE SICK, THEN--

12:30.333 --> 12:32.875
LOOK, I'M NOT SICK.

12:32.917 --> 12:35.041
I'M NOT. I HAVE A THING,
AND DR. BENNETT CAN FIX IT.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.625
I LOCATE I.E.D.s, BOMBS.

12:37.667 --> 12:41.083
I HAVE PEOPLE IN MY SQUAD
WHO DEPEND ON ME TO STAY ALIVE.

12:41.125 --> 12:43.667
I DEPEND ON YOU
TO STAY ALIVE.

12:43.709 --> 12:46.542
YOUR BABY DEPENDS ON YOU
TO STAY ALIVE.

12:46.583 --> 12:49.333
THE ARMY CAN REPLACE YOU.
I CAN'T.

12:53.083 --> 12:56.542
CAN YOU FIX THIS WITH SURGERY,
MAKE ME AS GOOD AS NEW?

12:56.583 --> 12:59.125
I CAN.

13:01.083 --> 13:04.709
I WANT THE SURGERY.
I'M A SOLDIER. IT'S WHAT I DO.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.291
AND I WANT TO GO BACK.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.041
SO HOW'S IT BEEN
WITH YOUR STEPDAD SCOTT,

13:11.083 --> 13:14.000
YOU KNOW,
SINCE THEY GOT MARRIED?
HE'S PRETTY COOL.

13:14.041 --> 13:16.000
I'VE NEVER HAD A DAD BEFORE,

13:16.041 --> 13:19.041
SO WE GET TO DO
SOME STUFF TOGETHER, FUN STUFF.

13:19.083 --> 13:21.709
BUT I THINK
HE'S A LITTLE FREAKED OUT

13:21.750 --> 13:24.458

WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?

13:24.500 --> 13:27.125

OKAY.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.834
(whispers) HI.

20:10.875 --> 20:13.041
MM.

20:13.083 --> 20:15.792
YOU GIVE HIM VITAMINS
AND AN HOUR OF THERAPY,

20:15.834 --> 20:18.959
AND THEN HE GOES HOME
AND EATS DIRT. LITERALLY DIRT.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.041
AS I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU
YESTERDAY, WE CAN WORK WITH HIM.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.250
BUT THERE ISN'T ALWAYS
A SIMPLE ANSWER.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.041
(scoffs)
NOW ALL WE CAN DO IS WORK

20:26.083 --> 20:27.834
TO REDIRECT HIS URGES
TO OTHER THINGS.

20:27.875 --> 20:30.041
STRAIGHT OUT OF
THE FLOWER BED--DIRT.
I'M SORRY.

20:30.083 --> 20:33.250
KELLY, DON'T YOU THINK THAT
HE WANTS TO CHANGE THIS?

20:33.291 --> 20:37.208
I THINK IF HE WANTED TO,
HE WOULD.

20:37.250 --> 20:40.375
AND I'M AFRAID THIS WHOLE THING
IS GONNA BE TOO MUCH FOR SCOTT.

20:40.417 --> 20:42.041
HE HAS BEEN PATIENT.

20:42.083 --> 20:44.041
HE HAS BEEN A SAINT
WITH ALL THIS.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.041
BUT WHAT I NEED FROM YOU,
YOU PROFESSIONALS,

20:46.083 --> 20:48.792
IS TO DO SOMETHING.
SO BASICALLY,
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

20:48.834 --> 20:50.792
YOU CARE MORE ABOUT KEEPING
YOUR HUSBAND

20:50.834 --> 20:52.834
THAN YOU DO
ABOUT HELPING YOUR CHILD?
COOPER.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.041
I JUST...

20:54.083 --> 20:56.041
WANT HIM TO BE NORMAL.

20:56.083 --> 20:59.333
PUTTING A MASK ON HIS FACE
DOES NOT MAKE HIM FEEL NORMAL.

20:59.375 --> 21:01.959
I AM TRYING TO HELP HIM.
ARE YOU?
WHY DON'T WE DIAL THIS BACK?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.333
LOOK, I SEE A LOT OF KIDS
WITH A LOT OF ISSUES,

21:04.375 --> 21:06.667
AND ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,
OLIVER IS HURTING.

21:06.709 --> 21:09.500
HE IS HURTING IN SOME WAY,
AND YOU NEED TO LET ME FIGURE--

21:09.542 --> 21:13.125
YOU--YOU NEED TO LET DR. WALLACE
FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS.

21:13.166 --> 21:17.166
AND HOWEVER HARD IT IS ON YOU,
IT IS HARDER ON HIM.

21:20.917 --> 21:23.333
THAT WAS UNPROFESSIONAL
IN THERE.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.333
SHE SHOULD BE WORRIED
ABOUT HER SON,

21:25.375 --> 21:28.625
NOT HER HUSBAND OR HERSELF.
OH, AND YOU THINK TELLING HER
OFF IS GONNA MAKE THINGS BETTER?

21:28.667 --> 21:31.333
LOOK, YOU ARE AGITATED
ABOUT THIS PATIENT

21:31.375 --> 21:33.041
AND ABOUT CHARLOTTE.

21:33.083 --> 21:36.000
CHARLOTTE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

21:36.041 --> 21:38.917
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT HER
STILL PUSHES YOUR BUTTONS.

21:38.959 --> 21:40.500
BUTTON-PUSHING, WE CALL IT.

21:40.542 --> 21:42.500
YEAH. SHE TOLD ME
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

21:42.542 --> 21:45.500
OH, THAT IS
SO NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

21:45.542 --> 21:48.291
WHEN IT AFFECTS OUR PATIENT,
IT IS.

21:48.333 --> 21:51.458
I'M NOT TRYING TO FIX SOMETHING
BECAUSE MY LIFE IS BROKEN.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.875
MY LIFE IS FINE.
IT'S THE PATIENT THAT IS BROKEN.

21:53.917 --> 21:55.208
FIX HIM.

21:59.166 --> 22:01.417
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

22:01.458 --> 22:04.083
HE'S, UH,
JUST HAVING A BOTTLE.

22:04.125 --> 22:07.709
VIOLET, IF--IF...
IF THIS TOO MUCH FOR YOU--

22:07.750 --> 22:09.542
NO. NO.

22:09.583 --> 22:11.166
IT'S NOT TOO MUCH.

22:11.208 --> 22:14.125
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.125
I MEAN, IT WOULD BE ONE THING
IF I WAS A BAD MOTHER,

22:17.166 --> 22:21.333
IF I WAS MEAN TO MY KID
OR HIT MY KID.

22:21.375 --> 22:24.041
BUT I'M...
NOT A MOTHER AT ALL.

22:24.083 --> 22:26.041
YOU ARE.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.583
YOU'RE HIS... MOTHER.

22:28.625 --> 22:32.166
YOU'RE MORE OF A MOTHER
THAN I AM.
VIOLET...

22:32.208 --> 22:34.208
I'M SORRY.

22:34.250 --> 22:37.333
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

22:37.375 --> 22:39.375
YOU SAVED LUCAS' LIFE.

22:40.875 --> 22:43.417
AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THAT,
REALLY.

22:43.458 --> 22:45.041
IT'S JUST THAT...

22:45.083 --> 22:46.834
THIS...

22:46.875 --> 22:49.250
YOU AND LUCAS,

22:49.291 --> 22:52.041
YOU AND PETE...

22:52.083 --> 22:55.041
I MEAN, I EXPECTED A LOT
OF THINGS WHEN I CAME HOME,

22:55.083 --> 22:58.458
BUT MY SON LOVING YOU
WAS NOT ONE OF THEM.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.583
(Lucas sucks on bottle)

23:04.625 --> 23:06.417
(babbles)

23:06.458 --> 23:09.417
I CAN'T HAVE KIDS.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

23:09.458 --> 23:11.458
I'VE GOT, LIKE, ONE EGG LEFT

23:11.500 --> 23:14.041
OR SOMETHING HORRIBLE...
LIKE THAT,

23:14.083 --> 23:16.041
AND--AND I'M OKAY WITH IT.

23:16.083 --> 23:19.000
I AM. I HAD MADE... MY PEACE.

23:19.041 --> 23:22.000
I... (exhales) WASN'T
ONE OF THOSE CRAZY WOMEN

23:22.041 --> 23:25.792
WHO CRIED, YOU KNOW,
EVERY TIME SHE SAW... A BABY.

23:25.834 --> 23:27.792
I JUST SHUT IT DOWN.

23:27.834 --> 23:33.500
BUT THEN, UH...
PETE AND I HAPPENED, AND...

23:33.542 --> 23:35.625
THAT MEANT LUCAS, TOO.

23:35.667 --> 23:39.041
AND IT WAS SO SCARY FOR ME,
YOU KNOW, TO... (sniffles)

23:39.083 --> 23:41.625
ALLOW MYSELF TO...

23:41.667 --> 23:45.250
ENJOY HIM, TO... LOVE HIM.

23:45.291 --> 23:50.291
BUT WHEN I DID,
IT WAS LIKE...

23:50.333 --> 23:53.041
IT WAS LIKE I WAS BROKEN...

23:53.083 --> 23:55.041
AND LUCAS FIXED ME.

23:55.083 --> 23:58.208
AND NOW I CAN'T IMAGINE
MY LIFE WITHOUT HIM.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.583
I CAN'T. I JUST...

24:00.625 --> 24:03.875
SO YOU COMING BACK--
AND--AND I'M THRILLED...

24:03.917 --> 24:05.875
(sniffles) THAT YOU'RE BACK,
GENUINELY,

24:05.917 --> 24:09.208
BECAUSE I...
I LIKE YOU, VIOLET,

24:09.250 --> 24:11.875
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
WAS SO...

24:13.583 --> 24:15.041
(sighs)

24:15.083 --> 24:16.291
BUT FOR ME, IT MEANS--

24:16.333 --> 24:18.917
I-I...

24:18.959 --> 24:20.291
IT JUST--I'M--IT'S--

24:20.333 --> 24:23.333
I'M SAYING,
IT'S HARD FOR ME, TOO.

24:28.417 --> 24:30.500
I WANT TO HATE YOU
SO BADLY.

24:30.542 --> 24:32.750
I WANT TO PUNCH YOU
IN THE FACE.
(laughs)

24:32.792 --> 24:34.375
(laughs)

24:34.417 --> 24:36.000
(laughs)

24:38.333 --> 24:42.041
WELL, I SHOULD GO.
AND YOU...

24:42.083 --> 24:45.083
YOU'RE DOING FINE...
WITH HIM.

24:45.125 --> 24:46.667
I KNOW.

24:46.709 --> 24:48.375
RIGHT?

24:48.417 --> 24:50.375
I MEAN, I WASN'T SURE
IF I WOULD.

24:50.417 --> 24:52.375
I-I'VE NEVER BEEN GOOD
WITH KIDS--

24:52.417 --> 24:55.125
OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS--
BUT, UH...

24:55.166 --> 24:59.000
I'M GOOD AT TAKING CARE
OF MY SON.

25:02.875 --> 25:05.834
HE'LL PICK YOU...

25:05.875 --> 25:09.583
BECAUSE YOU'RE HIS MOTHER,
YOU KNOW.

25:09.625 --> 25:12.959
IN THE END,
HE'LL PICK YOU.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.166
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:15.208 --> 25:17.166
BABIES GET ADOPTED
ALL THE TIME.

25:17.208 --> 25:18.625
THEY LOVE
THEIR ADOPTED MOTHERS.

25:18.667 --> 25:21.625
THEY--THEY DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT THEIR BIRTH MOTHERS.

25:21.667 --> 25:25.125
I WASN'T
TALKING ABOUT LUCAS.

25:36.083 --> 25:38.333
WHAT HAPPENED?
OH, MY GOD. SCOTT AND I
GOT IN AN ARGUMENT.

25:38.375 --> 25:41.041
IT WAS OVER OLIVER. HE OVERHEARD
IT. HE GOT UPSET AND HE RAN--
I FOUND HIM IN THE GARAGE.
HE WAS LOOKING WHITE

25:41.083 --> 25:43.542
AND HE WAS SCARED.
WHAT'S IN THE GARAGE?

25:43.583 --> 25:47.041
EVERYTHING--BUG SPRAY,
UH, UH, GARDENING STUFF.
OLIVER, CAN YOU
TELL ME WHAT YOU ATE?

25:47.083 --> 25:49.125
HEY. CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU ATE?

25:49.166 --> 25:51.125
I NEED A CHEM PANEL,
A TOX SCREEN,

25:51.166 --> 25:53.583
AND LET'S GIVE HIM
50 OF CHARCOAL.
WHAT--WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:53.625 --> 25:56.041
THEY'RE GOING TO PUMP
HIS STOMACH.
OH!

25:56.083 --> 25:58.166
OLIVER. HEY, BUDDY,
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

25:58.208 --> 26:00.709
IT'S A ROUTINE SURGERY.

26:00.750 --> 26:03.375
I'M COMING BACK.

26:03.417 --> 26:05.667
YOUR WIFE REALLY LOVES YOU.

26:05.709 --> 26:07.875
I MEAN, IT'S GOTTA BE
HARD ON HER,

26:07.917 --> 26:09.667
WORRYING ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

26:09.709 --> 26:12.667
WHAT, YOU THINK THAT I DON'T
WORRY ABOUT HER, ESPECIALLY NOW?

26:12.709 --> 26:15.041
HELL, I KNOW THAT
I SHOULD BE HERE. I DO.

26:15.083 --> 26:17.041
A MAN
SHOULD BE WITH HIS CHILD.

26:17.083 --> 26:19.291
BUT, YOU KNOW, LUCIA'S GONNA
BE HERE WHEN I GET BACK,

26:19.333 --> 26:22.458
AND IF I STAY, I CAN'T SAY
THE SAME THING ABOUT MY GUYS.
THERE ARE OTHER GUYS

26:22.500 --> 26:24.500
WHO CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE
OVER THERE.

26:24.542 --> 26:27.500
IF EVERYONE SAID THAT, WHO'D BE
THERE FIGHTING FOR US?
WELL, I'M GUESSING YOUR WIFE

26:27.542 --> 26:29.500
WOULD RATHER
YOU WERE FIGHTING FOR HER.

26:29.542 --> 26:31.166
IT'S A GIRL THING.

26:31.208 --> 26:33.208
WELL, YOU PULL ME
THROUGH THIS,

26:33.250 --> 26:36.250
AND I'LL MAKE SURE
I FIGHT FOR BOTH.

26:38.667 --> 26:40.333
HIS VESSELS HAVE CALCIFIED.

26:40.375 --> 26:43.041
I DON'T KNOW
IF THE STENT'S GONNA HOLD.

26:43.083 --> 26:46.542
I'M GONNA OPEN UP HIS CHEST
AND BYPASS THE VESSEL.

26:46.583 --> 26:48.333
THE STENT SHOULD COMPRESS
AND SEAL THE TEAR.

26:48.375 --> 26:50.291
YOU COULD WAIT,
SEE IF IT HOLDS.

26:50.333 --> 26:53.750
I MEAN, YOU CONVERT TO BYPASS,
HE'S NOT GOING BACK.

26:53.792 --> 26:55.750
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:55.792 --> 26:57.875
ALL RIGHT, NOTIFY O.R.
I'M GONNA BYPASS.

26:59.542 --> 27:02.041
SO LAWN FURNITURE,
HUH, OLIVER?

27:02.083 --> 27:04.750
YOU ATE
SOME MOLDY LAWN FURNITURE.

27:04.792 --> 27:07.041
JUST THE CUSHIONS.

27:07.083 --> 27:10.041
OH, YEAH. I KNOW. I SAW IT
WHILE IT WAS COMING UP.

27:10.083 --> 27:12.041
(retches)
(laughs)

27:12.083 --> 27:14.333
YOUR THROAT'S GONNA BE SORE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

27:14.375 --> 27:17.333
BUT WE'LL RUN SOME TESTS,
WE'LL MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY,

27:17.375 --> 27:19.333
AND THEN WE'LL GET YOU HOME.
ALL RIGHT?

27:19.375 --> 27:22.333
I'M JUST GONNA EAT
MORE STUFF.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.333
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
KEEP ME HERE

27:24.375 --> 27:27.750
AND SEW MY MOUTH SHUT?
HEY, BELIEVE ME. IF I COULD
SEW A KID'S MOUTH SHUT,

27:27.792 --> 27:30.333
I WOULD BE
A REALLY WEALTHY PEDIATRICIAN.

27:30.375 --> 27:31.458
(laughs)

27:31.500 --> 27:33.458
YOU JUST WORRY
ABOUT GETTING BETTER.

27:33.500 --> 27:36.792
I'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.
I'M GONNA GET YOU SOME WATER.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.375
(grunts)

27:44.417 --> 27:46.166
OH...

27:46.208 --> 27:48.375
(cries)

27:48.417 --> 27:50.083
(knock on door)

27:50.125 --> 27:52.041
HI.

27:52.083 --> 27:54.333
HEY.

27:56.333 --> 27:59.291
UM... LUCAS ISN'T HERE.
THE NANNY WENT--

27:59.333 --> 28:00.834
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

28:00.875 --> 28:02.792
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT US.

28:05.625 --> 28:07.041
YEAH?

28:07.083 --> 28:10.500
OH, NOT--I MEAN... (chuckles)
NOT "US" US.

28:10.542 --> 28:14.166
I-I MEANT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
ABOUT LUCAS.

28:14.208 --> 28:15.959
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.625
UH, WELL, UM,

28:17.667 --> 28:19.166
I ORDERED A CRIB ONLINE,

28:19.208 --> 28:21.166
AND IT SHOULD BE HERE
ON THURSDAY.

28:21.208 --> 28:23.542
AND, UH, MY HOUSE WAS
ALREADY CHILDPROOFED.

28:23.583 --> 28:26.208
AND I ORDERED, UH, DIAPERS
AND CAR SEATS AND TOYS

28:26.250 --> 28:29.208
AND ALL THAT STUFF.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BUY HIM THINGS, VIOLET.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.375
WELL, I MEAN,
I'M GONNA NEED IT.

28:31.417 --> 28:33.417
AND I FIGURED WE COULD
WORK OUT A SCHEDULE,

28:33.458 --> 28:35.417
AND I COULD PAY HALF OF
THE NANNY BILL,

28:35.458 --> 28:37.750
AND I'M TOTALLY WILLING
TO REIMBURSE YOU

28:37.792 --> 28:40.250
FOR ANY BACK CHILD CARE
OR ANY OTHER EXPENDITURES

28:40.291 --> 28:42.667
THAT YOU MAY HAVE--
W-W-WAIT--WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

28:42.709 --> 28:44.667
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

28:44.709 --> 28:48.250
W--LOOK, I-I KNOW THIS IS NOT
GONNA HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY.

28:48.291 --> 28:51.291
I KNOW IT'S A PROCESS.

28:51.333 --> 28:55.041
SO I FIGURED WE COULD
TRANSITION LUCAS VERY SLOWLY.

28:55.083 --> 28:58.792
START OUT WITH DAILY VISITS,
THEN MAYBE AN OVERNIGHT,

28:58.834 --> 29:00.875
MAYBE ONE WEEK WITH YOU,
ONE WEEK WITH ME--

29:00.917 --> 29:02.875
NO.

29:02.917 --> 29:04.208
NO?

29:04.250 --> 29:07.041
YOU'VE BEEN BACK
FOR TWO DAYS.

29:07.083 --> 29:09.291
LET'S...
TAKE THIS SLOW.

29:09.333 --> 29:12.041
YOU WERE RECENTLY THINKING
ABOUT MOVING TO NEW YORK,

29:12.083 --> 29:14.500
FOR GOD SAKE--
RIGHT, I-I TOLD YOU,
THAT WAS A CRISIS POINT.

29:14.542 --> 29:17.208
WHICH TO ME MEANS I'M NOT
LETTING YOU HAVE LUCAS.

29:17.250 --> 29:19.709
OKAY, PETE, PETE, JUST--LET'S
JUST SLOW DOWN, START AGAIN.

29:19.750 --> 29:22.041
ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT I WANT TO SHARE--

29:22.083 --> 29:23.458
NO.
WHAT--

29:23.500 --> 29:26.041
MY SON IS NOT GOING TO BE
PART OF YOUR THERAPY.

29:26.083 --> 29:28.041
I'M HIS FATHER.
AND I'M HIS MOTHER.

29:28.083 --> 29:29.875
WHO GAVE HIM AWAY.

29:29.917 --> 29:33.709
YOU SHOWED UP AT MY DOORSTEP
AND YOU GAVE HIM AWAY.

29:35.333 --> 29:37.083
THAT WAS LOW, PETE.

29:37.125 --> 29:40.083
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH.
YOU KNOW WHAT I...

29:40.125 --> 29:42.542
Y--YOU KNOW ME.

29:42.583 --> 29:44.625
COME ON, PETE.
YOU KNOW ME.

29:44.667 --> 29:46.625
I DO KNOW YOU,
BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

29:46.667 --> 29:49.041
I HAVE TO DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR LUCAS.

30:08.375 --> 30:12.250
(woman speaking over p.a.
indistinctly)

30:12.291 --> 30:14.917
SO...

30:14.959 --> 30:17.792
YOUR SON
IS STRUGGLING WITH PICA,

30:17.834 --> 30:20.792
AND YOU HAVE IT, TOO,
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,

30:20.834 --> 30:23.375
TO HIM OR TO US.

30:23.417 --> 30:25.583
YOU LIED.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.291
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
YOU'VE HAD IT?

30:31.333 --> 30:33.166

30:33.208 --> 30:36.041

WHEN I WAS NERVOUS

30:36.083 --> 30:39.417
OR WHEN THINGS
WERE REALLY BAD.

30:39.458 --> 30:41.417
BUT I GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.

30:41.458 --> 30:45.583
I JUST...
MADE MYSELF STOP...

30:45.625 --> 30:47.208
UNTIL TODAY.

30:47.250 --> 30:50.625
WITH OLIVER SO SICK,
IT WAS JUST SO STRESSFUL, I--
STRESSFUL FOR YOU?

30:50.667 --> 30:53.041
IT'S STRESSFUL FOR HIM.
HE'S 10 YEARS OLD.

30:53.083 --> 30:56.000
AND HE'S FEELING WEIRD ENOUGH
ABOUT THIS PROBLEM,

30:56.041 --> 30:59.250
AND HE HAS IMPULSES
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO CONTROL,

30:59.291 --> 31:02.417
AND INSTEAD OF TELLING HIM
THAT YOU HAVE IT, TOO,

31:02.458 --> 31:04.417
YOU PUT A MASK ON HIM.

31:04.458 --> 31:06.667
WELL, I THOUGHT
THAT WOULD STOP IT.

31:06.709 --> 31:09.959
I WANTED TO SPARE HIM THAT.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.125
BUT YOU LIED TO HIM,

31:12.166 --> 31:15.166
MAKING IT SO HE CAN
NEVER TRUST YOU...

31:15.208 --> 31:17.166
ABOUT ANYTHING.

31:25.041 --> 31:27.208
WHEN WE OPENED YOU UP,
YOUR CORONARY ARTERIES

31:27.250 --> 31:30.041
WERE TOO CALCIFIED
TO HOLD THE STENT.

31:30.083 --> 31:32.041
NOW IF I HADN'T
CONVERTED TO A BYPASS,

31:32.083 --> 31:34.667
YOU WOULD'VE HAD
A HEART ATTACK.

31:34.709 --> 31:37.041

32:39.417 --> 32:41.375

YOU SHOULD NOT... DO THAT.
