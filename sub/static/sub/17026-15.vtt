00:50.120 --> 00:51.200
Previously:

00:51.200 --> 00:52.280
How about your husband?

00:52.400 --> 00:53.280
I'm not married.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.160
Boyfriend?

00:54.320 --> 00:56.280
I don't have one.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.680
Anything changes
with Jody, call me.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.920
Or just call me.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.720
I will.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.000
It's not over with Sam.
Not for me, anyway.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.160
Did you realise that

01:06.280 --> 01:08.640
before or after
you had sex with Daria?

01:08.640 --> 01:10.240
It was a mistake.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.720
You still love him?

01:11.880 --> 01:14.840
And at some level, The faculty will
always see you as "Little Neela".

01:14.960 --> 01:17.279
You go somewhere new,
you'll be taken seriously

01:17.479 --> 01:19.799
in a way that will not happen
if you stay.

01:27.999 --> 01:29.959
Food's here!

01:31.319 --> 01:34.839
I have never had so much
takeout in my life.

01:35.039 --> 01:37.519
Well, I thought
you liked Vietnamese.
Yeah, I like it,

01:37.639 --> 01:39.599
but there are places in Chicago

01:39.759 --> 01:42.599
with chairs and tables
and food on plates.

01:42.599 --> 01:44.399
Ah, but no bed.

01:44.519 --> 01:46.639
That's an excellent point. Yes.

01:46.799 --> 01:48.599
Now we're not on
for another two hours,

01:48.759 --> 01:50.399
so we should ride in together.

01:50.559 --> 01:53.359
Unless someone
might see you.

01:53.479 --> 01:57.439
Mm, being covert
is more exciting, isn't it?

01:57.559 --> 01:58.799
Yeah.

01:58.919 --> 02:02.519
(phone rings)

02:02.599 --> 02:03.839
Oh, wait.

02:03.959 --> 02:07.599
No-no-no-no,
leave it, leave it. Ah!

02:07.599 --> 02:09.079
Hello?

02:09.079 --> 02:10.758
Yeah.

02:10.758 --> 02:11.759
Really?

02:12.639 --> 02:13.519
Yeah, that's great.

02:13.679 --> 02:15.039
Can I... can I take
a number?

02:15.159 --> 02:17.999
Yep, thank you.

02:20.039 --> 02:22.959
That was Duke. The department
chair wants to meet me.

02:23.159 --> 02:25.919
What, uh, about
the attending position?

02:25.919 --> 02:27.599
Yeah, I can't
believe it.

02:27.759 --> 02:29.199
I thought I'd sunk myself
in the interview.

02:29.319 --> 02:31.279
Well, Dr Corday
must have been very impressed.

02:31.399 --> 02:32.439
When is it?

02:32.559 --> 02:33.759
This weekend.

02:33.919 --> 02:35.199
This...?

02:35.319 --> 02:36.639
Wow, that's soon.

02:36.759 --> 02:38.359
That's... that's great.

02:38.479 --> 02:41.839
Can you actually imagine me
being in North Carolina?

02:41.999 --> 02:43.319
I mean, I only took
the interview

02:43.479 --> 02:44.759
to get the banker
off my back.

02:44.879 --> 02:46.639
I didn't consider moving there.

02:46.799 --> 02:50.599
Well, that is the risk
of being a brilliant surgeon.

02:50.599 --> 02:51.719
Are you leaving?

02:51.879 --> 02:53.559
Yeah, I should, um...

02:53.719 --> 02:55.359
I should get back
to my apartment

02:55.519 --> 02:57.359
and grab some clothes
before my shift.

02:57.479 --> 02:59.439
But I thought we were gonna...

02:59.519 --> 03:01.999
You save me a spring roll, yeah?

03:05.159 --> 03:07.159
(door closes)

03:07.319 --> 03:09.559
No fractures of
the alveolar ridge.

03:09.719 --> 03:11.919
I knew better than to play
that shady-ass club last night.

03:12.039 --> 03:13.759
Belly's soft,
no obstruction.

03:13.919 --> 03:16.559
Lost my health insurance.
401k's in the gutter. Now look?

03:16.559 --> 03:17.759
Two teeth in the
small intestine.

03:17.919 --> 03:19.599
Thank God.
Can you get 'em out?

03:19.719 --> 03:21.879
They should pass on their own
in a day or two.

03:21.959 --> 03:23.679
Um... here.

03:23.799 --> 03:25.519
Flush discriminately.

03:25.599 --> 03:26.999
Poor guy.

03:27.119 --> 03:27.999
That's disgusting.

03:28.119 --> 03:29.319
I gotta call
my accountant.

03:29.439 --> 03:30.639
Tooth guy's going home.

03:30.759 --> 03:32.639
Botox lady's up in psych,

03:32.759 --> 03:34.639
and Mr Lam's sleeping it off in 2.

03:34.759 --> 03:36.399
You talking to me?

03:36.479 --> 03:37.599
No. Where's Brenner?

03:37.719 --> 03:38.759
Break room, suiting up.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.559
Oh, come on. Come on!
I gotta go!

03:40.679 --> 03:41.799
So what did you decide on?

03:41.879 --> 03:42.919
Gibson's or Divina Cucina?

03:43.119 --> 03:44.639
None of the above.
Claudia made the plans.

03:44.719 --> 03:46.079
I like the sound of that.

03:46.239 --> 03:47.879
Yeah, meeting her
at some address in Elmhurst.

03:47.879 --> 03:48.919
I'll bet it's
something romantic.

03:49.039 --> 03:50.199
A river walk
under the stars.

03:50.279 --> 03:51.399
Ooh, or wine-tasting?

03:51.559 --> 03:53.119
I bet it's hot cop fantasy
role-play stuff.

03:53.239 --> 03:54.119
Handcuffs and whatnot.

03:54.279 --> 03:55.359
No! Grady!

03:55.479 --> 03:56.639
I'll let you know.

03:56.799 --> 03:58.479
What kind of operation
you run around here, doc?

03:58.639 --> 03:59.479
My back's killing me.

03:59.599 --> 04:00.839
I'm so sorry.

04:00.959 --> 04:02.719
We're still waiting on HMO
approval for your MRI.

04:02.919 --> 04:04.719
Someone should be down soon.
Well, hurry it up.

04:04.919 --> 04:07.319
If I'm gonna rot,
I'd rather do it
in my lazyboy.

04:07.479 --> 04:08.599
That's the last
of the marcaine.

04:08.759 --> 04:10.759
All right, thanks, Cecilia.

04:10.919 --> 04:12.839
Dilantin level on your
seizure guy came back low.

04:12.959 --> 04:14.199
All right.
Push 500 milligrams,

04:14.359 --> 04:16.358
I'll get him
ready to go.

04:16.519 --> 04:17.719
That's it?
For now.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.439
All right, you know,
this is still weird for me.

04:19.439 --> 04:20.439
What are you
talking about?

04:20.439 --> 04:21.399
Us. We've broken up.

04:21.559 --> 04:22.799
We're working together.
It's weird.

04:22.959 --> 04:24.839
We said we weren't gonna
screw up our schedules.

04:25.079 --> 04:27.599
Some awkwardness
while we're finding
our bearings is...

04:27.759 --> 04:28.959
Weird?
It's expected.

04:29.079 --> 04:29.999
That's what you say.

04:30.079 --> 04:32.279
Guys, listen up.

04:32.399 --> 04:34.759
Banfield is out sick,
but she left instructions

04:34.919 --> 04:36.159
to get patient satisfaction
scores up.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.679
Tony, congratulations.
Yours are the worst
in the department.

04:38.839 --> 04:41.239
She's had me
on geriatrics study for weeks.

04:41.399 --> 04:42.639
They're not the most
enthusiastic bunch.

04:42.839 --> 04:45.079
Just rub their feet,
work a jigsaw puzzle.

04:45.079 --> 04:47.119
78-year-old male passed out
at home, combative in the rig.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.199
Ten minutes out.

04:48.279 --> 04:49.479
Bingo.

04:49.639 --> 04:51.639
Oh, come on. Banfield's not
here. Give me someone

04:51.719 --> 04:53.039
a little less salty?

04:53.159 --> 04:54.839
I got a kid mixing X
and valerian root.

04:54.999 --> 04:57.399
Dawn, you get
Dr Gates' numbers up this shift,

04:57.519 --> 04:58.399
it's dinner at Gibson's.

04:58.519 --> 04:59.519
I'll foot the bill.

04:59.679 --> 05:01.759
Don't blow this for me.
Sam, you're with me.

05:02.519 --> 05:03.639
Hey, you know
department policy

05:03.799 --> 05:05.959
about switching weekend
shifts at short notice?

05:06.079 --> 05:07.919
Depends on Banfield's mood.

05:08.039 --> 05:09.039
You going out of town?

05:09.199 --> 05:11.278
No. Well, maybe.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.438
North Carolina, maybe.

05:12.598 --> 05:13.918
Hey, Dr Brenner,
my delivery was short.

05:14.078 --> 05:15.598
You mind if I steal some Kerlix
from your supply room?

05:15.758 --> 05:17.798
Yeah, sure, you go ahead.
I'll grab it for you. Here.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.998
What's in North Carolina? Uh, n-not,

05:20.158 --> 05:22.998
not sure, really, nothing,
no-nothing definite...

05:23.118 --> 05:24.038
(laughs)

05:24.158 --> 05:25.318
What?

05:25.398 --> 05:26.918
Nothing.

05:26.998 --> 05:27.998
All right.

05:28.158 --> 05:30.598
I get it.
Secret getaway.

05:30.758 --> 05:33.598
Well, whoever it is,
my advice: keep it casual, fun.

05:33.598 --> 05:34.758
You think?

05:34.958 --> 05:36.558
Believe me,
it's a long way down.

05:36.638 --> 05:37.958
Is that the rig?

05:38.118 --> 05:39.118
They said it was
ten minutes out.

05:39.198 --> 05:40.438
Stop, stop!

05:40.558 --> 05:42.038
(tyres squealing)

05:43.638 --> 05:46.478
(alarm blaring)

06:00.918 --> 06:02.238
Girl:
Mom!

06:02.398 --> 06:05.078
What happened?
Check on Zadro!

06:05.238 --> 06:06.318
I'm Dr Brenner.
Joanie.

06:06.478 --> 06:08.598
OK, Joanie,
any trouble breathing?

06:08.718 --> 06:10.238
Um, Lucy,
are you OK?

06:10.398 --> 06:12.198
I think so.
Honey... ow, ow, ow.

06:12.398 --> 06:13.358
Ow, ow.
Oh, Mom.
What is it?

06:13.558 --> 06:15.518
My hip, my hip, my hip.
Don't move, Joanie.

06:15.678 --> 06:16.958
That goes for you, too.
I want you

06:17.118 --> 06:19.038
to take a big,
deep breath.

06:19.198 --> 06:20.078
Pulse rate 120.

06:20.198 --> 06:21.078
I'm OK.

06:21.158 --> 06:22.238
I can get out.

06:22.358 --> 06:23.998
Lucy, Lucy, you stay there.

06:24.078 --> 06:25.078
Let us check you first, OK?

06:25.238 --> 06:26.398
I need a collar!

06:27.518 --> 06:28.958
Ugh, hit my head.

06:29.118 --> 06:30.558
We got to get you
on a backboard.

06:30.638 --> 06:31.718
Are you serious?

06:31.878 --> 06:33.798
Look at this rig.
You're lucky to be alive, man.

06:33.918 --> 06:34.958
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

06:35.118 --> 06:37.198
Clear bilaterally,
sternal contusion.

06:37.198 --> 06:38.598
Yeah, the seatbelt hurt
your chest.

06:38.758 --> 06:39.758
Ouch.

06:39.918 --> 06:41.078
Right hip tender
with internal rotation.

06:41.238 --> 06:42.958
Mom!
Your daughter's here.

06:43.078 --> 06:44.518
Are you OK?
We cleared her neck outside.

06:44.718 --> 06:46.438
Listen to what the doctors say.
She just has

06:46.598 --> 06:48.118
a minor forearm burn
from the car's airbag.

06:48.238 --> 06:50.038
Put her in sutures;
I think mom has a broken hip.

06:50.198 --> 06:51.558
Could have an
intra-abdominal bleed.

06:51.678 --> 06:52.518
They were separated outside.

06:52.638 --> 06:53.678
Just give 'em a minute, OK?

06:53.798 --> 06:55.238
OK, fine, we need a hemocue.

06:55.238 --> 06:57.638
I want to go home.
You got this.

06:57.798 --> 06:59.558
Frank has my sign-outs.
Make sure the back pain

06:59.718 --> 07:00.878
gets an MRI;
his HMO won't approve it.

07:01.038 --> 07:02.558
So, what do you want
me to do about it?

07:02.678 --> 07:04.518
Talk them into it.
No, Archie, no, not today.

07:04.678 --> 07:06.118
Look, you stay if you feel
that strongly about it.

07:06.238 --> 07:07.598
But I can't.
I'm sorry.

07:07.718 --> 07:09.798
Pulse ox 97 on two litres.

07:09.918 --> 07:12.598
Set up for a fast.

07:13.118 --> 07:14.198
All right, your neck is fine.

07:14.358 --> 07:17.518
I just need
to sew up your forehead.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.078
What about steri-strips?

07:19.198 --> 07:20.958
Ah, it's well into the sub-Q.

07:21.078 --> 07:23.518
Well, how about that super glue?

07:23.678 --> 07:24.958
You'll have much better
results with sutures.

07:25.118 --> 07:26.518
You should listen
to your doctor.

07:27.518 --> 07:29.638
Hey, Sam,
drunk driver?

07:29.758 --> 07:31.678
Mom and daughter. Not sure why.

07:32.558 --> 07:34.438
Huh. Well, I hope they're OK.

07:35.958 --> 07:38.438
Dr Gates, that old guy
with syncope is here.

07:38.598 --> 07:40.558
Go. Someone else
can stitch me up.

07:40.678 --> 07:42.878
OK, I'll come back
to check you out.

07:43.038 --> 07:44.198
(siren wailing)

07:44.358 --> 07:45.998
I need a signature
for Dr Gates

07:46.118 --> 07:48.398
on this patient satisfaction
form before you go.

07:48.518 --> 07:50.758
It's already filled out.

07:50.878 --> 07:52.398
Just sign it.

07:52.518 --> 07:54.718
This is Leo Malcolm,
found down at home,

07:54.838 --> 07:55.718
unconscious
on the scene,

07:55.878 --> 07:57.158
Woke up in the rig
after a litre.

07:57.318 --> 07:58.998
I'm Dr Gates.
Do you know where you are?

07:58.998 --> 08:00.678
Some fleabag hospital,
looks like.

08:00.798 --> 08:03.598
Tachy at 118.
BP: 98/40. Sats 97.

08:03.758 --> 08:05.758
Heart's beating pretty fast.
Does anything hurt?

08:05.878 --> 08:07.278
I'm fine.

08:07.438 --> 08:09.438
Man can't take a nap without big
brother knocking at the door.

08:09.598 --> 08:10.678
Family installed
some kind of motion detector

08:10.798 --> 08:12.198
in the house;
no movement for an hour,

08:12.358 --> 08:14.398
paramedics get a call
from the monitoring company.

08:14.518 --> 08:15.638
All right, let's
go, Mr Malcolm.

08:15.758 --> 08:16.918
May as well get it over with.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.438
I feel
the same way.

08:18.558 --> 08:19.478
Dr Gates.

08:19.638 --> 08:21.078
I mean, welcome
to County, sir.

08:21.238 --> 08:23.358
We're so glad
you're here.

08:27.398 --> 08:28.518
Acetabular fracture.

08:28.638 --> 08:29.518
That's bad?

08:29.638 --> 08:31.678
You broke the socket
of your hip joint.

08:31.798 --> 08:33.038
We can reconstruct
it surgically,

08:33.198 --> 08:35.198
but you'll need to stay at
the hospital while it mends.

08:35.318 --> 08:36.518
How long will that take?

08:36.638 --> 08:38.798
A week, another month of rehab.

08:38.957 --> 08:40.717
No, I can't. I have Lucy.

08:40.837 --> 08:42.078
If the pelvis
doesn't heal properly,

08:42.238 --> 08:43.518
you'll develop arthritis,
chronic pain.

08:43.678 --> 08:45.518
You could need a total
hip replacement.

08:45.598 --> 08:47.598
All set.

08:47.758 --> 08:49.558
I got a tetanus shot, Mom.

08:49.718 --> 08:51.518
Your daughter
was very brave.

08:51.518 --> 08:52.798
She's my angel.

08:54.558 --> 08:55.958
I don't know what happened.

08:56.118 --> 08:58.758
I mean, one minute we were driving
along, singing with the radio,

08:58.918 --> 09:01.278
and the next,
my car won't stop.

09:01.438 --> 09:02.958
You're lucky it happened
in front of the hospital.

09:03.078 --> 09:04.438
Yeah. God's plan, right?

09:05.437 --> 09:07.157
Right, right, Mom.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.317
Excuse me.
Dr Fazzio is on the phone.

09:09.437 --> 09:11.277
Is he approving the MRI?

09:11.397 --> 09:12.557
Fork over the four grand,

09:12.717 --> 09:14.197
he says you can do
anything you want.

09:14.277 --> 09:15.757
Unbelievable.

09:15.877 --> 09:17.077
I'm ordering it.

09:17.237 --> 09:18.477
Be careful, let's not
stick a patient

09:18.637 --> 09:22.477
with a huge bill for an
unauthorized procedure.

09:22.557 --> 09:23.517
Hey, Lucy,

09:23.677 --> 09:26.077
have you ever seen a
newborn baby close up?

09:26.197 --> 09:27.357
Come on.

09:27.477 --> 09:28.837
I'll take you
to where they're sleeping.

09:28.997 --> 09:30.037
It's OK.
OK.

09:30.117 --> 09:32.677
I'll be right back.

09:35.557 --> 09:38.117
I've been looking after her
alone for so long.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.997
You never expect something
like this to happen.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.877
Well, we can hold off on surgery

09:42.037 --> 09:43.797
while you find someone
to take her home.

09:43.957 --> 09:45.637
Do you have any
family nearby?

09:45.797 --> 09:47.957
Uh, my mom died
when I was in college.

09:48.117 --> 09:50.717
Do you have any friends
that can take her, uh, siblings?

09:50.837 --> 09:53.957
I have a brother Stuart, but
we haven't talked in a while.

09:54.117 --> 09:55.957
Last I heard,
he works a bar on Cicero.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.797
I can call him
if you want.

10:00.677 --> 10:02.317
If he's reachable,
we need to try.

10:04.997 --> 10:07.837
Look, Lucy was three
the last time we saw him.

10:07.957 --> 10:09.837
He shows up late one night,

10:09.997 --> 10:11.237
and he says he's
in trouble; he needs

10:11.437 --> 10:13.557
a place to stay,
regroup, whatever.

10:13.557 --> 10:15.677
When we woke up,
he was long gone.

10:15.797 --> 10:17.037
He'd stolen a bunch of cash

10:17.197 --> 10:20.397
from my wallet
and my mom's wedding ring.

10:20.557 --> 10:23.077
My family's gotten
pretty small since then.

10:26.557 --> 10:29.517
I have a neighbour that looks
after her sometimes.

10:29.517 --> 10:30.717
We, we can just ask her.

10:31.877 --> 10:32.877
OK.

10:33.517 --> 10:34.637
What labs
do you want?

10:34.797 --> 10:37.797
CBC, BMP,
and a blood culture.

10:38.557 --> 10:39.637
Oh!

10:39.797 --> 10:42.397
All right,
mid-epigastric tenderness.

10:42.557 --> 10:44.317
Yeah, your stomach would hurt
like this, too,

10:44.437 --> 10:45.837
if I pushed you like that.

10:46.077 --> 10:47.837
There's nothing
wrong with me.
(beeping)

10:47.957 --> 10:49.477
Systolic only 88.

10:49.677 --> 10:52.317
So this doesn't hurt?
Don't be so disappointed.

10:52.477 --> 10:53.957
Little stick here.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.557
That's it. That's it.
I'm out of here.

10:56.557 --> 10:57.477
Where are you going?
I'm going home.

10:57.637 --> 10:59.477
No, no, come on.
Get out of my way, kid.

10:59.637 --> 11:00.837
No, you're not going
anywhere.

11:01.037 --> 11:02.517
Do you want me to
call Dr Brenner?
I got this.

11:02.677 --> 11:04.157
Yeah, that's it. Goodbye.
Leo, put this back.

11:04.277 --> 11:05.597
The paramedics would not
have brought you in here

11:05.757 --> 11:07.197
if they thought
nothing was wrong with you.

11:07.357 --> 11:09.117
Your heart's beating
way too fast.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.877
Your blood pressure
is very low.

11:10.957 --> 11:12.677
Let me help you.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.637
I'm fine, you know. I'm fine.

11:17.637 --> 11:19.197
Finger?

11:23.917 --> 11:26.797
Now, doctor... Everybody
wants to help me.

11:26.957 --> 11:29.037
Draw some blood,
will you?

11:29.197 --> 11:30.477
What?! Wait, hold it.
Wait a minute, man.

11:30.597 --> 11:31.717
My, my daughter, you know?

11:31.717 --> 11:33.077
She had these computers
all over my house.

11:33.197 --> 11:35.157
Couldn't even go to the can
without this little...

11:35.277 --> 11:36.237
light blinking at me.

11:36.397 --> 11:38.077
She's probably just
worried about you.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.437
Yeah, but she should have let me
go to the assisted-living place.

11:41.597 --> 11:43.877
At least there I wouldn't
be bothering nobody.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.157
All right, let's order
an abdominal series.

11:46.277 --> 11:48.197
What's that?
Take x rays of your belly.

11:48.317 --> 11:50.277
I'm fine.

11:50.437 --> 11:52.717
Now, come on.
Look, if it's clear,

11:52.837 --> 11:54.117
I'll call you a cab. Deal?

11:54.117 --> 11:56.477
Ah... um...

11:56.477 --> 11:58.037
Deal.

12:00.277 --> 12:01.997
No fever,
no neuro deficit.

12:02.117 --> 12:03.757
That it's an epidural abscess
is a long throw.

12:03.917 --> 12:06.197
Worsening pain for weeks,
not relieved with Vicodin.

12:06.357 --> 12:07.917
Think we should image him
before he's paralyzed?

12:08.037 --> 12:09.637
Of course I do,
but it's not our call.

12:09.837 --> 12:12.157
Dr Brenner, someone called
this guy about his sister.

12:12.277 --> 12:13.957
You're Stuart Moore?

12:14.077 --> 12:15.677
You're the one said
Joanie was asking about me?

12:15.757 --> 12:16.917
Yeah, I called you, yeah.

12:17.037 --> 12:17.997
Must be bad, man.

12:18.157 --> 12:19.237
I'm the last person
she'd call.

12:19.397 --> 12:21.637
OK, she's back here.
Uh, Dr Brenner!

12:21.757 --> 12:22.837
Frank, his sister...

12:22.997 --> 12:24.397
His sister's in Trauma 1.
Would you mind?

12:24.517 --> 12:25.997
I'll be with you in a minute.

12:26.117 --> 12:28.477
Look. Dr Fazzio promised
he'd be down in the next hour.

12:28.597 --> 12:29.917
If he doesn't approve it,

12:30.117 --> 12:31.597
call my cell.
I'll deal with it.

12:31.757 --> 12:33.877
Fine.
Really? I can go?

12:33.997 --> 12:35.117
Hallelujah. Thank you.

12:35.237 --> 12:36.277
Hey, Sam!

12:36.437 --> 12:39.157
I, uh, talked to Dubenko
about the roux-en-y

12:39.317 --> 12:40.917
with the robotic surgery
system next week.

12:40.917 --> 12:42.077
Cool. Thanks.

12:42.197 --> 12:44.037
We've seen you upstairs
quite a bit lately.

12:44.237 --> 12:46.317
Yeah, I'm taking
as many OR shifts as I can.

12:46.437 --> 12:49.157
I'm not really having
a great time down here.

12:49.237 --> 12:50.837
Tony. Breakup.

12:50.997 --> 12:52.957
Oh. You seem
to be managing.

12:53.077 --> 12:54.477
For the most part.

12:54.597 --> 12:55.477
You know him.

12:55.637 --> 12:57.357
Yeah.
We had coffee.

12:57.517 --> 12:59.917
He apologised.
I yelled.

13:00.077 --> 13:02.476
Then we both decided we didn't
want it to affect our jobs.

13:02.596 --> 13:04.356
So... that's that.

13:04.476 --> 13:06.036
I'm sorry.

13:06.196 --> 13:08.996
It's OK. For now,
I'm keeping my work life

13:09.116 --> 13:10.476
out of my life life.

13:10.596 --> 13:12.436
Well, sounds like a plan.

13:15.076 --> 13:16.756
I figured you were done
loaning me money.

13:16.876 --> 13:17.996
So you rob me?

13:18.156 --> 13:19.436
My car was
in the shop, Joanie.

13:19.636 --> 13:22.556
How was I supposed to get to work?
Guys, we need
to calm down in here.

13:22.716 --> 13:23.916
I am talking
about what you did to me.

13:24.076 --> 13:25.996
You want
your half of Mom's ring?

13:25.996 --> 13:27.196
What is he doing here?

13:27.396 --> 13:29.436
I told you that I did not want
him called.

13:29.556 --> 13:30.796
All right, I'm sorry,

13:30.956 --> 13:32.676
but we called your neighbours;
they're out of town.

13:32.836 --> 13:33.956
Stuart's the only
family Lucy has.

13:34.116 --> 13:35.116
It's him or
foster care.

13:35.236 --> 13:36.836
She'd be better off
with strangers.

13:36.916 --> 13:37.996
We're fine.

13:39.156 --> 13:40.796
CT can take her.

13:41.356 --> 13:42.676
Everything OK?

13:42.836 --> 13:44.636
OK.
My brother here needs to leave.

13:44.876 --> 13:46.876
Call CT. We're
going to take
her upstairs.
Wait. Wait.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.596
If something's happening
with Lucy, I should know.

13:48.716 --> 13:50.036
Why?

13:50.116 --> 13:51.356
Why should you know?

13:51.356 --> 13:53.156
You don't deserve anything!

13:55.436 --> 13:57.436
OK. You know what?

13:57.436 --> 13:59.036
Your problem.

13:59.036 --> 14:00.796
Have a nice life.
Get out!

14:00.916 --> 14:02.996
Stuart, look.

14:03.116 --> 14:04.676
I'm sorry about all this.
I didn't realise...

14:04.836 --> 14:06.076
Yeah, look, it was
my mistake to come.

14:06.196 --> 14:08.236
Look, your sister's sick.

14:08.396 --> 14:10.276
Now someone needs to take
care of Lucy for a while.

14:10.436 --> 14:12.796
That ain't me.
Sam, he's not interested.

14:12.956 --> 14:14.236
I'm leaving, all right?
Hey.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.676
Just leave me alone.
Just gonna walk away?

14:15.876 --> 14:16.876
Believe me,
it's what she wants.

14:16.996 --> 14:18.236
It's not what your niece wants.

14:18.396 --> 14:20.636
What do you know about it?
She needs someone.

14:20.796 --> 14:22.556
Stuart?

14:25.316 --> 14:27.276
Lucy's not my niece.

14:28.276 --> 14:30.236
She's my daughter.

15:29.516 --> 15:31.436
# Here come the girls...

15:42.796 --> 15:44.676
# Here come the girls!

15:45.756 --> 15:49.276
Get 3 for 2 Mix & Match across
facial skincare products

15:49.276 --> 15:51.076
only until Tuesday at...

15:58.596 --> 16:00.636
Let's do something good tonight.

16:00.716 --> 16:02.236
Just me and you.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.516
Dinner for two.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.316
We'll have Scottish salmon fillets,

16:06.396 --> 16:07.596
responsibly sourced,

16:07.716 --> 16:10.956
with baby new potatoes,
some fine green beans

16:11.036 --> 16:13.636
and a cuddle on the sofa for afters.

16:14.396 --> 16:16.356
Dinner for two, for:

16:17.516 --> 16:18.876
Sorted.

16:20.596 --> 16:22.236
Good with food.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.516
Who says only young skin
can be luminous?

16:26.636 --> 16:28.596
Skin looks dull when
its radiance is blocked

16:28.676 --> 16:30.356
by dry, old skin cells.

16:30.476 --> 16:32.836
pro.age, with
the highest levels of AHAs,

16:32.916 --> 16:34.756
helps speed up cell renewal.

16:34.876 --> 16:36.796
After only two weeks,
the tape test proves -

16:36.876 --> 16:38.916
visibly fewer old skin cells.

16:39.636 --> 16:42.756
Help turn your skin
from dull to luminous.

16:45.236 --> 16:47.596
Dove pro.age Beauty Body Lotion.

16:47.676 --> 16:49.156
Now save a third

16:49.276 --> 16:51.236
on Dove pro.age
hand and body care

16:51.316 --> 16:52.356
in Boots.

16:53.996 --> 16:56.235
Behind this level of brilliance,

16:56.355 --> 16:59.315
there has to be an equally brilliant
dishwasher tablet.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.955
Finish Quantum is scientifically
proven to cut through grease,

17:03.035 --> 17:04.595
powerfully remove stains

17:04.714 --> 17:06.954
and deliver
our best-ever clean and shine.

17:08.515 --> 17:11.915
That's why all these dishwasher
manufacturers recommend it.

17:13.275 --> 17:14.915
It's only dishwashing,

17:15.035 --> 17:18.435
but we believe you deserve
flawless results every time.

17:24.355 --> 17:25.835
Come on, kids!

17:26.795 --> 17:28.155
Wow!

17:28.234 --> 17:30.235
That was your first bike, remember?

17:32.115 --> 17:34.955
Dirt takes its toll
on things you cherish.

17:35.075 --> 17:37.875
Cif Cream with micro-particles
lifts dirt easily...

17:37.955 --> 17:40.115
Mum! Look at my glasses!

17:40.195 --> 17:41.835
..bringing back the clean...

17:41.955 --> 17:43.715
- (giggles)
- Hm.

17:44.675 --> 17:46.835
..and a new lease of life.

17:47.595 --> 17:49.635
It's amazing what comes clean...

18:23.755 --> 18:27.795
Wouldn't it be nice if you could save
money when you do the washing?

18:27.795 --> 18:30.115
And still clean off tough stains
like beans?

18:30.115 --> 18:31.715
Tea?

18:31.715 --> 18:33.435
And chocolate sauce?

18:33.435 --> 18:35.435
New Ariel Excel Gel

18:35.435 --> 18:38.315
gives outstanding cleaning
from as low as 15 degrees.

18:38.835 --> 18:42.035
So you save up to Â£1 per pack
in energy

18:42.035 --> 18:43.915
when you turn down to cold.

18:44.275 --> 18:47.155
Outstanding cleaning
from as low as 15 degrees

18:47.155 --> 18:50.475
and brilliant savings
with new Ariel Excel Gel

18:50.475 --> 18:52.395
Now that is...

19:47.195 --> 19:49.155
So Joanie's not her mother?

19:49.275 --> 19:52.155
I don't know
where her mom is.

19:52.315 --> 19:55.115
She took off when,
uh, Lucy was three.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.035
And Lucy has no idea?

19:59.275 --> 20:01.115
I haven't exactly
been around.

20:02.195 --> 20:04.595
Yeah, I know.

20:04.595 --> 20:06.875
Look, I didn't know
what I was doing.

20:06.875 --> 20:09.355
I wasn't supposed
to have a kid.

20:09.355 --> 20:10.835
I figured leaving
her with Joanie

20:10.995 --> 20:12.875
was the best I could do.

20:12.995 --> 20:14.795
(sighs)

20:14.955 --> 20:16.795
Asking your sister
to raise your child--

20:16.955 --> 20:18.875
That's a pretty
big favour.

20:19.035 --> 20:21.675
Guess that's why
I didn't ask.

20:25.755 --> 20:27.715
Joanie's in trouble.

20:29.715 --> 20:31.635
She needs your help now.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.235
I got a tiny apartment.

20:38.555 --> 20:41.515
I-I play guitar at a bar.

20:45.515 --> 20:48.555
Hey, maybe you'll...
maybe you'll surprise yourself.

20:52.874 --> 20:54.914
I doubt it.

20:58.874 --> 21:01.114
Yeah, look, I got to go.

21:01.234 --> 21:02.714
So, uh,

21:02.874 --> 21:04.394
Tell Joanie
I had to go to work.

21:04.474 --> 21:06.554
Uh, maybe I'll come visit later.

21:06.674 --> 21:07.634
Sure.

21:10.714 --> 21:12.634
So?

21:13.714 --> 21:16.314
He's not going to do it.

21:18.514 --> 21:20.474
Call foster care
when you're done with the CT.

21:24.474 --> 21:25.474
It's been
over an hour.

21:25.594 --> 21:27.074
You said you were going
to call me a cab.

21:27.274 --> 21:29.154
The results are
on their way.
Huh.

21:30.874 --> 21:33.674
Hey, look, I got light-headed,
and I fainted.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.194
It's no big deal.

21:35.354 --> 21:36.674
Why can't you
understand that?

21:36.674 --> 21:38.794
Whatever you have, Leo,
let us try to fix it.
Ah.

21:38.914 --> 21:40.434
I'm sure you will.

21:40.554 --> 21:42.394
Hi, I'm Dr Rasgotra.

21:42.554 --> 21:44.434
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Got tied up.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.674
I've got the OR
standing by.

21:46.794 --> 21:48.674
Free air under the diaphragm.

21:48.834 --> 21:50.114
Yeah, it's most likely
a perfed ulcer.

21:50.274 --> 21:51.834
He's been taking
large doses

21:51.954 --> 21:53.594
of Ibuprofen
for his arthritis.

21:53.754 --> 21:55.474
Do you have
any belly pain?

21:55.594 --> 21:56.474
No.

21:56.634 --> 21:59.354
Well, the nsaids could
be masking the symptoms.

21:59.514 --> 22:02.434
Mr Malcolm, air in the abdomen
is not normal.

22:02.594 --> 22:05.394
We need to go in,
find the perforation,
and repair it.

22:05.514 --> 22:07.434
Go in? Lady, I'm 78 years old.

22:07.434 --> 22:09.194
It's true there's some
increased risk associated

22:09.194 --> 22:13.194
with surgery at your age, but there
should be a good outcome.

22:13.194 --> 22:15.114
If you don't do
this operation,

22:15.234 --> 22:16.914
you could die.

22:17.034 --> 22:18.914
What are we waiting for?

22:19.034 --> 22:20.194
Cancer?

22:20.314 --> 22:22.634
I've seen that.

22:22.714 --> 22:24.794
No, thank you.

22:24.954 --> 22:27.394
You sure this is
your decision?

22:27.514 --> 22:29.434
Yes. No, thank you.

22:31.434 --> 22:32.834
His daughter's here.

22:32.954 --> 22:35.034
All right, have 'em
hold on a second.

22:35.194 --> 22:37.794
Look, Leo, this is one relatively
routine operation.

22:37.874 --> 22:39.394
You could be home in a few days.

22:39.554 --> 22:41.394
Oh, yeah, that's what
they told my wife.

22:41.554 --> 22:43.314
Two years later she was still
in the hospital

22:43.434 --> 22:45.754
tied to... to the hoses
and machines.

22:47.794 --> 22:49.914
I can't do that, ma'am.

22:51.314 --> 22:53.354
You get to stay here
and watch all the action.

22:53.514 --> 22:54.874
We're going to see
inside my mom?

22:54.994 --> 22:57.394
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

22:57.554 --> 23:00.354
I can do a 3-D
reconstruction.

23:00.514 --> 23:02.354
Wow.

23:02.514 --> 23:04.394
Taggart:
How are you doing?

23:04.474 --> 23:05.954
A little dizzy.

23:06.074 --> 23:08.314
It's probably
the morphine.

23:10.034 --> 23:12.354
Will I be able to meet
the foster family

23:12.474 --> 23:14.714
before she goes?
Of course.

23:14.714 --> 23:16.234
And she can
visit me here?

23:16.354 --> 23:17.834
Yeah.

23:17.954 --> 23:19.194
Every day.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.154
Two weeks are going
to fly by. You'll see.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.674
She deserves better than Stuart.

23:26.754 --> 23:28.794
Does she remember him at all?

23:28.914 --> 23:31.754
She knows that she has an uncle.

23:31.874 --> 23:33.394
She knows she met him once.

23:33.474 --> 23:35.474
That he lives in the city.

23:36.994 --> 23:39.034
My brother...

23:39.034 --> 23:41.674
he wasn't always like this.

23:44.114 --> 23:45.914
But I'm worried
that if I'm stuck here,

23:46.034 --> 23:47.394
he'll use it against me.

23:47.514 --> 23:49.394
He could use custody

23:49.514 --> 23:51.354
to blackmail me for money.

23:51.474 --> 23:53.194
It's what he does.

23:53.314 --> 23:54.954
But you're her mom now.

23:56.034 --> 23:58.394
Not legally.

24:00.154 --> 24:03.154
I always thought adoption
was just a formality.

24:03.354 --> 24:06.834
I never thought
that I could ever really...

24:06.834 --> 24:08.674
lose her.

24:10.754 --> 24:13.154
You won't.

24:14.154 --> 24:17.234
Joanie, he's not coming back.

24:18.714 --> 24:21.234
So what happens now?

24:21.394 --> 24:22.914
Well, he's refusing
treatment.

24:23.074 --> 24:24.954
There's nothing
we can do.

24:25.074 --> 24:26.434
Nothing?

24:26.554 --> 24:28.554
This is a hospital.
You can't just let someone die.

24:28.674 --> 24:29.754
It's his choice.

24:29.914 --> 24:32.434
It's been one battle
after another

24:32.514 --> 24:33.994
since my mom died.

24:34.114 --> 24:37.994
Trying to move him out
of his house, give up his car.

24:37.994 --> 24:40.674
Feels like I should know
how to do this.

24:40.674 --> 24:42.674
Well, you know,
sometimes people

24:42.834 --> 24:44.713
make this kind of decision
when they're depressed.

24:44.833 --> 24:47.713
Maybe we can have him
talk to somebody.

24:47.833 --> 24:49.673
Like a psychiatrist?

24:49.833 --> 24:52.233
Yeah, they can offer
counselling, medication.

24:52.393 --> 24:55.833
I know he's not ready
to say goodbye.

24:59.473 --> 25:01.433
(music playing)

25:06.433 --> 25:08.353
Hi, Archie.

25:08.473 --> 25:10.033
I'm late. I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.

25:10.153 --> 25:11.153
Come on in.

25:12.153 --> 25:13.633
Nice place.

25:13.833 --> 25:15.113
Here, these
are for you.
Oh.

25:15.273 --> 25:16.513
I have a surprise for you.

25:16.673 --> 25:17.953
Oh, yeah?
What kind of surprise?

25:18.113 --> 25:19.913
Hey, are those cupcakes?
Yes.

25:20.033 --> 25:21.073
And balloons.

25:21.233 --> 25:22.153
I like balloons,
I guess.

25:22.273 --> 25:23.793
Archie, this is
my mom, Olga.

25:23.993 --> 25:24.913
My sister,
Lorraine.

25:25.073 --> 25:27.393
My cousins Bianca, Javier,
Gabriella, Jose.

25:27.553 --> 25:28.433
And these are
my grandmothers,

25:28.553 --> 25:29.913
Carmen and Alicia.

25:30.993 --> 25:31.993
Hi.

25:33.433 --> 25:34.953
(elevator bell rings)

25:35.153 --> 25:36.673
Hey, I'm having
Psych see Leo.
What? Why?

25:36.673 --> 25:38.193
Well, if we can have him
declared incompetent,

25:38.353 --> 25:40.153
then we can have
power of attorney
transferred to his daughter

25:40.313 --> 25:41.873
and have the operation.
But he's not incompetent.

25:42.033 --> 25:43.233
He simply doesn't
want treatment.

25:43.393 --> 25:45.393
Well, if not incompetent,
then depressed.

25:45.513 --> 25:46.633
It's natural at his age.

25:46.833 --> 25:48.233
Part of the process
of letting go.
You know what?

25:48.393 --> 25:50.433
If a 25-year-old kid came in
and refused surgery,

25:50.593 --> 25:51.953
you'd get Psych involved
just like that.

25:52.113 --> 25:54.193
He's not 25. And it's his right
to decide

25:54.353 --> 25:55.633
whether he wants
his last years spent

25:55.793 --> 25:56.873
in and out
of hospital beds.

25:57.033 --> 25:58.953
You have to respect
his wishes.

25:59.073 --> 26:00.953
Frank, isn't it
a bit ridiculous

26:01.113 --> 26:02.873
to file four different copies
of the base station report?

26:02.873 --> 26:05.993
Gee, that thought has
never occurred to me.

26:05.993 --> 26:07.353
Neela, um... look,

26:07.353 --> 26:09.153
just put the rest of them
in the break room.

26:09.153 --> 26:11.313
Also, your father-of-the-year
is out there in waiting.

26:11.473 --> 26:12.953
Stuart Moore?
He came back?

26:13.113 --> 26:14.273
Yeah, I'm watching my wallet.

26:14.393 --> 26:16.273
I suggest you do the same.

26:16.433 --> 26:18.593
Car crash in the
ambulance bay.

26:18.753 --> 26:20.073
Dysfunctional
family drama--

26:20.233 --> 26:21.513
a little bit
of everything.
Yeah.

26:21.673 --> 26:23.313
Well, listen, I was...
about Duke...

26:23.473 --> 26:24.833
Yeah, I'm sorry
about that.

26:24.993 --> 26:26.713
I don't know
why I was going on.

26:26.873 --> 26:28.113
I guess I got caught
off guard.

26:28.193 --> 26:29.313
Well, it's a big move.

26:29.433 --> 26:31.273
You're probably right
to be a little hesitant.

26:31.433 --> 26:32.713
Listen, I was thinking
maybe we could...

26:32.833 --> 26:34.393
I booked my flight.

26:34.553 --> 26:36.433
You did?
Yeah, Lucien switched my schedule.

26:36.593 --> 26:38.273
He said if I couldn't come up
with a better reason

26:38.433 --> 26:39.473
than nerves...
Of course.

26:39.553 --> 26:40.673
That's... that's good.

26:40.833 --> 26:41.913
Well, it's just
an interview, right?

26:42.033 --> 26:43.673
No need to make any
big life decisions.

26:43.673 --> 26:45.593
I'll see you later.
All right. Bye.

26:45.713 --> 26:47.873
Need some help here!

26:47.993 --> 26:49.113
Mom!

26:49.273 --> 26:50.913
I need some help!
Mom, wake up!

26:51.033 --> 26:52.233
I need a doc.
Dr Brenner!

26:52.433 --> 26:54.033
Mom? Mom...
She needs to rest
now, honey.

26:54.233 --> 26:57.233
Dropped her pressure in CT;
dropped her sats; lungs are wet.
What are you guys doing?

26:57.353 --> 26:58.833
Pink, frothy sputum,
pulmonary edema.

26:58.993 --> 27:00.473
What is that?!
Congestive heart failure?

27:00.633 --> 27:01.793
OK, we're helping
her breathe, Lucy.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.753
She might have bruised
her heart in the crash.

27:03.993 --> 27:06.513
Mommy! Mommy,
are you OK? Mom!
Bipap, 40 of Lasix.

27:06.633 --> 27:09.033
I got the airway!
Mom, tell me you're OK!

27:09.033 --> 27:11.673
You need to calm down, OK?
But what are you guys doing?

27:11.673 --> 27:12.673
30 on 15, Tony.

27:12.833 --> 27:14.273
Let's see if we
can avoid intubation.

27:14.393 --> 27:15.513
Multifocal PVCs.

27:15.633 --> 27:16.793
Hundred of Lidocaine.

27:17.273 --> 27:18.833
Mommy, please
talk to me! Mommy!

27:18.953 --> 27:21.473
She's sleeping, Lucy,
because her oxygen level's low.

27:21.633 --> 27:23.193
Sometimes when the heart
isn't pumping well,

27:23.313 --> 27:24.593
the lungs fill with fluid.

27:24.753 --> 27:27.633
Damn. Diffuse hypokinesis.
Ejection fraction 20%.

27:27.633 --> 27:29.473
Looks like a dilated
cardiomyopathy.

27:29.593 --> 27:30.833
That can't be from the crash.

27:31.033 --> 27:33.913
What's happening?
Your mom's heart
isn't doing its job.

27:34.073 --> 27:35.513
We're trying
to find out why.

27:35.633 --> 27:36.873
Run of six on the monitor.

27:37.033 --> 27:38.233
Did she present
in failure?

27:38.433 --> 27:39.473
No, she was
compensating.

27:39.633 --> 27:40.553
She couldn't handle
the two litres

27:40.713 --> 27:42.273
of saline
we gave her.
Mommy!

27:42.433 --> 27:43.393
Mommy!
V-tach.

27:43.513 --> 27:44.673
Charge to 300.

27:44.793 --> 27:45.713
Stop!

27:45.873 --> 27:48.113
We're charged.
All right, clear!

27:48.233 --> 27:49.193
Can someone get her
out of here, please?!

27:49.193 --> 27:51.353
All right, clear.
Stop!

27:51.353 --> 27:52.553
No change.

27:52.553 --> 27:56.433
No, no! Mommy! Mommy!

27:56.553 --> 27:58.273
I want to stay!

27:58.433 --> 27:59.993
(screaming):
I want to stay!

28:56.752 --> 28:58.072
DRAMATIC MUSIC

When pain strikes,

28:59.592 --> 29:01.192
new formula Nurofen Express

29:01.272 --> 29:02.312
targets pain

29:02.432 --> 29:04.712
twice as fast
as standard Nurofen tablets.

29:07.712 --> 29:08.792
This is Iams.

29:08.792 --> 29:11.952
And this... This is other cat food.

29:11.952 --> 29:14.032
To keep me in tip top condition

29:14.032 --> 29:17.232
you only need to feed me
this much Iams every day.

29:17.232 --> 29:20.712
Whereas you'd have to feed me up to
four of these.

29:20.712 --> 29:22.192
Apparently,... (doorbell)

29:22.192 --> 29:26.592
Apparently, gram for gram Iams
has more high quality nutrition.

29:26.592 --> 29:28.632
But you have to check the label,

29:28.632 --> 29:30.792
because unfortunately...

29:30.792 --> 29:31.832
I can't read!

30:07.472 --> 30:11.552
Ever had that feeling that your love
life is spiralling out of control?

30:11.552 --> 30:13.152
You've made a life-changing decision

30:13.152 --> 30:16.512
and promised to organise a make
or break trip to Rome and then...

30:16.512 --> 30:19.312
at the crucial moment
when you absolutely HAD to book

30:19.312 --> 30:21.712
the last two remaining flights...

30:21.712 --> 30:23.552
..you suddenly lost internet
connection?

30:25.072 --> 30:26.712
And then you realise

30:26.712 --> 30:28.912
it was all just a bad dream.

30:28.912 --> 30:32.872
Nobody gives you a better wireless
connection than BT Total Broadband.

30:32.872 --> 30:35.472
Stay connected. Call...

30:56.312 --> 30:58.072
helps promote healthy digestion,

30:58.192 --> 31:00.472
helps support some natural defences.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.272
Cow & Gate Complete Care.

31:04.392 --> 31:05.232
(giggles)

31:26.712 --> 31:28.072
# "I Couldn't Live
Without Your Love"

31:28.192 --> 31:30.992
He's not just bringing you
the latest news.

31:31.112 --> 31:33.952
# A shoulder there
for me to cry on

31:34.032 --> 31:34.912
# No one knows...

31:34.992 --> 31:37.392
He's not just making you smile.

31:37.472 --> 31:39.512
# Even though my love...

31:39.632 --> 31:42.032
He's not just going out with you
in any weather.

31:42.112 --> 31:44.112
# I couldn't live without your love

31:45.272 --> 31:46.792
Love him back

31:46.872 --> 31:49.152
with new recipes from Cesar,

31:49.232 --> 31:50.312
carefully sourced ingredients

31:50.432 --> 31:52.872
for all the balanced nutrition
he needs every day.

31:56.992 --> 31:58.512
Not a morning person?

31:58.592 --> 32:00.312
Wake up to Garnier Eye Roll-on.

32:01.592 --> 32:02.952
Enriched
with caffeine,

32:03.072 --> 32:04.192
the cooling
moisturiser

32:04.272 --> 32:05.152
instantly:

32:05.552 --> 32:06.992
..tired-looking
eyes.

32:07.072 --> 32:08.912
The roll-on massages the eye area

32:08.992 --> 32:10.832
for a bright-eyed look.

32:13.152 --> 32:14.112
Got yours?

33:10.311 --> 33:13.351
Yeah, OK, that sounds good.
You call me when you're ready.

33:14.831 --> 33:15.951
Was that cardiology?

33:16.071 --> 33:17.711
Fulminant myocarditis.

33:17.871 --> 33:20.391
A heart biopsy is gonna tell us
if it's treatable with steroids.

33:20.511 --> 33:22.071
What about the hip surgery?

33:22.231 --> 33:24.151
We'll keep her in traction
for a couple of days,

33:24.311 --> 33:25.751
give her lungs
a chance to dry out

33:25.911 --> 33:27.231
before we subject her
to general anaesthesia.

33:27.351 --> 33:28.991
Hey, uh, I put the little girl
in the break room.

33:29.151 --> 33:31.151
Social Service
is on their way down.

33:31.311 --> 33:33.631
Geez, poor kid. Two weeks is scary
enough, but a month?

33:33.631 --> 33:35.231
And then if the biopsy
shows scarring...

33:35.431 --> 33:36.831
Well, the brother's
out in waiting.

33:36.991 --> 33:38.391
I'm going to speak to him.
Maybe he'll reconsider.

33:38.551 --> 33:40.511
Whoa, we're not sending her home
with that guy.

33:40.671 --> 33:42.031
Sam, he's the father.

33:42.191 --> 33:44.151
He deserves to know if his
child's going to be sent off

33:44.311 --> 33:45.471
to live with strangers.
He didn't mind

33:45.631 --> 33:46.751
abandoning her in the
middle of the night.

33:46.911 --> 33:48.751
That was six years ago.
Sam, this is different.

33:48.871 --> 33:50.311
You think?

33:54.711 --> 33:57.871
Hey, it was a slow night.
How'd the surgery go?

33:57.871 --> 34:00.151
She hasn't had it yet.

34:03.391 --> 34:06.431
We discovered Joanie
was in heart failure.

34:07.591 --> 34:10.351
I don't... from the car crash?

34:10.511 --> 34:11.871
No, it's something else,
I think.

34:11.991 --> 34:14.511
We're running a test now
to assess the damage.

34:14.871 --> 34:18.871
Stuart, your daughter
was with Joanie

34:19.031 --> 34:20.951
when she needed CPR.

34:20.951 --> 34:22.831
She's scared.

34:22.831 --> 34:25.951
She needs a place
to stay tonight.

34:28.031 --> 34:29.670
Yeah.

34:29.670 --> 34:33.231
Well, all right.

34:44.271 --> 34:45.991
Is my mom OK?

34:46.150 --> 34:48.630
Uh, she might be upstairs
for a little while.

34:49.831 --> 34:51.110
Lucy, there's someone
here to see you.

34:51.231 --> 34:52.751
This...

34:52.831 --> 34:54.150
This is, uh, Stuart.

34:55.311 --> 34:58.711
Your, uh, mom's told you
about me, I think.

34:58.831 --> 35:01.111
A little.

35:01.231 --> 35:03.751
You're my uncle?

35:05.391 --> 35:09.351
You probably don't remember,
but we met when you were little.

35:09.351 --> 35:11.831
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

35:14.231 --> 35:15.671
Uh, I've been busy.

35:15.791 --> 35:16.831
Yeah, I, uh...

35:16.951 --> 35:19.231
Stuart here is a musician.

35:19.711 --> 35:21.951
Really?

35:22.071 --> 35:23.911
That's cool.

35:23.911 --> 35:26.511
What kind of music?

35:26.631 --> 35:28.471
Um, rock mostly.

35:28.591 --> 35:30.391
You like music?

35:30.471 --> 35:31.951
I like the Police.

35:32.111 --> 35:35.471
What? Come on.
The Police? Really?

35:36.151 --> 35:38.671
My mom and I like the song
about dinosaurs.

35:39.511 --> 35:42.231
You ever, uh, you ever
listen to the Clash?

35:42.231 --> 35:44.111
They're all right.

35:45.831 --> 35:49.311
Liz Dade's here.
OK, um, Lucy,

35:49.311 --> 35:50.511
do you mind if I, um,

35:50.671 --> 35:51.951
leave you guys alone
for a minute?

35:52.111 --> 35:54.911
No, it's OK.
OK.

36:00.351 --> 36:02.191
You know, your mom
and I used to listen

36:02.351 --> 36:04.071
to the Police
when we were kids.

36:04.191 --> 36:06.391
We had it on a cassette tape.

36:06.511 --> 36:08.271
You know what that is?

36:08.271 --> 36:10.991
We used blast it so loud,
it drove your grandma crazy.

36:11.111 --> 36:12.431
(giggling)

36:13.231 --> 36:14.191
That's Stuart Moore?

36:14.271 --> 36:15.311
Yeah, he's the father.

36:15.431 --> 36:16.671
Technically.

36:16.831 --> 36:17.991
That's what
the birth certificate says.

36:17.991 --> 36:20.191
He has no criminal record,
no history of violence,

36:20.311 --> 36:21.711
no record of abuse.

36:21.831 --> 36:23.591
So, given the gravity
of Joanie's condition,

36:23.751 --> 36:25.031
he's a candidate
for temporary custody.

36:25.031 --> 36:26.751
If he wants it.
I think he will.

36:26.751 --> 36:28.951
What? You can't just show up
after six years

36:28.951 --> 36:30.430
and act like nothing's happened.

36:30.590 --> 36:32.750
I'll try to get a sense
if he can handle it.

36:32.750 --> 36:34.310
But yeah, he's the father.

36:34.310 --> 36:36.390
What about Joanie?
She knows Lucy best.

36:36.390 --> 36:38.030
She'll need to sign off.

36:38.190 --> 36:40.550
We are not gonna add
to the stress of her illness.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.270
I think it's a mistake.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.830
# Won't you send it southbound?

36:47.990 --> 36:49.990
# Give it
a cool bluesman name? #

36:50.070 --> 36:51.790
Like Lucy.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.150
Check this out.

36:53.150 --> 36:55.470
Here it comes.

36:55.470 --> 36:56.950
All right, you ready?

36:57.990 --> 37:00.550
# But on the southside
of heaven

37:00.670 --> 37:03.030
# Won't you take me home?

37:04.870 --> 37:07.270
# Cos I been broke down
for so long

37:07.390 --> 37:10.470
# Lord, it's getting cold... #

37:10.590 --> 37:11.990
Sing that part with me.

37:12.110 --> 37:14.590
# But on the southside
of heaven

37:14.590 --> 37:15.990
# Won't you take me home?

37:16.110 --> 37:17.270
That's it!

37:17.430 --> 37:20.830
# Cos I been broke down
for so long

37:20.950 --> 37:22.790
# Lord, it's getting cold... #

37:22.790 --> 37:25.830
(party music playing)

37:28.630 --> 37:30.950
So, uh, her nephew's
seventh birthday party.

37:31.110 --> 37:33.470
Seven years.

37:35.830 --> 37:38.070
Boy, what a fun age, huh?

37:38.230 --> 37:41.590
Just running around
with other seven-year-olds.

37:41.670 --> 37:43.470
Disculpenme, abuelitas.

37:43.630 --> 37:45.590
Le voy a ensenar la casa
a Archie antes de irnos.

37:45.710 --> 37:46.790
Come on.

37:46.870 --> 37:49.470
Come on!

37:49.590 --> 37:50.550
They don't speak English.

37:50.750 --> 37:51.590
Kinda wish
I knew that.
Yeah, why?

37:51.750 --> 37:53.510
You speak Spanish?
No, not really.

37:54.670 --> 37:55.750
Ay, Rogelio.
I'm fine!

37:55.830 --> 37:57.910
I'm fine!

37:57.910 --> 38:00.590
That's my cousin, Rogelio.
He always does this.

38:00.590 --> 38:03.070
Lorraine, don't worry. It'll be
fine. We'll just serve the cake.

38:03.070 --> 38:06.070
No. Superhero Gary is like
Philip's favourite TV character.

38:06.070 --> 38:08.030
If he sees this, he'll freak.

38:08.150 --> 38:09.390
What can we do?

38:09.390 --> 38:11.310
I don't know.

38:15.950 --> 38:18.470
(chanting):
Superhero Gary! Superhero Gary!

38:18.470 --> 38:21.470
Greetings, small children!

38:21.630 --> 38:23.550
You're not...
Gary?

38:23.630 --> 38:24.950
Nice tights.

38:25.110 --> 38:27.750
It's, uh, a beautiful day
in the neighbourhood.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.430
A beautiful day for...

38:29.590 --> 38:31.950
Uh... a birthday! It's somebody's
birthday, right?

38:31.950 --> 38:32.830
It's Philip's birthday.

38:32.990 --> 38:34.990
It's somebody's birthday!
Philip! Yes!

38:34.990 --> 38:35.950
What a rip-off.

38:36.070 --> 38:38.630
Uh, how old are you, Philip?

38:38.710 --> 38:40.870
You're not Superhero Gary.

38:40.870 --> 38:41.870
Of course I am.

38:41.990 --> 38:43.510
Yeah, I'm Superhero Gary.

38:43.670 --> 38:44.990
I'm the strongest
man in Chicago.

38:45.070 --> 38:46.950
With, uh, behold

38:47.070 --> 38:48.150
my biceps of superness!

38:48.270 --> 38:49.310
Ooh, those are fake.

38:49.430 --> 38:50.910
Your hair looks different.

38:51.070 --> 38:52.550
And his legs.
Yeah!

38:52.750 --> 38:56.310
Superhero Gary has man legs.
These are my bionic legs!

38:56.310 --> 39:00.110
Yes, for leaping buildings
in a single bound.

39:00.110 --> 39:02.110
What's a bound?
It's...

39:02.270 --> 39:04.310
Oh, nice shot!
Don't throw that.

39:04.470 --> 39:05.630
Hit him!
Get him!

39:05.750 --> 39:06.750
OK, Phillip, seriously.

39:06.870 --> 39:08.750
You guys, come on.

39:12.110 --> 39:14.310
Get him! Whoo!
Yeah, yeah!

39:16.910 --> 39:18.270
How are you feeling, Joanie?

39:18.270 --> 39:19.230
Better.

39:19.350 --> 39:20.310
Setting well on Bipap.

39:20.470 --> 39:22.750
Switching her
to ten litres by mask.

39:22.870 --> 39:24.110
I felt like I was drowning.

39:24.270 --> 39:26.350
Over a litre of urine
output with the Lasix.

39:26.470 --> 39:27.830
You get the results?

39:27.950 --> 39:33.390
Joanie... most
of your heart muscle

39:33.550 --> 39:35.310
has been replaced
by scar tissue.

39:35.310 --> 39:37.430
I don't understand.

39:40.950 --> 39:42.510
A virus attacked your heart.

39:42.510 --> 39:43.990
A virus?
What kind of virus?

39:44.150 --> 39:45.830
Well, it could have
been a cold or flu.

39:47.470 --> 39:48.710
Something in the last 12 months,
perhaps.

39:50.870 --> 39:52.630
How does something
like this happen?

39:52.630 --> 39:55.270
It's extremely rare.

39:55.430 --> 39:58.150
Now, unfortunately,
the damage is irreversible.

39:58.150 --> 40:00.710
Now, we'll wait to see
if your heart

40:00.710 --> 40:02.510
Responds to IV medication,

40:02.630 --> 40:04.830
but if it doesn't,

40:04.950 --> 40:06.790
we may have to put you
on the transplant list.

40:06.790 --> 40:10.630
Mom. Mom. Mom.

40:17.430 --> 40:18.870
What about Lucy?

40:23.550 --> 40:24.829
I'm gonna take her, Joan.

40:24.949 --> 40:26.909
No.

40:26.909 --> 40:29.029
Just for a couple of weeks
till you're better.

40:31.549 --> 40:34.309
It's a lot of responsibility.
Every day.

40:34.309 --> 40:35.669
He knows that.

40:35.829 --> 40:37.429
It's more than
just watching her.

40:38.749 --> 40:40.709
There's an old woman
who lives in my building.

40:40.909 --> 40:43.749
She baby-sits. She can
help out if I need it.

40:43.749 --> 40:45.349
Is that cool, kiddo?

40:45.469 --> 40:46.589
It's cool.

40:46.709 --> 40:49.109
We'll catch up for lost time.

40:49.109 --> 40:50.229
Stuart...

40:50.229 --> 40:51.989
Hey...

40:52.989 --> 40:55.029
I can do this.

40:56.669 --> 40:58.469
Let me prove it to you.

41:13.229 --> 41:15.549
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

41:15.549 --> 41:17.269
I want to.

41:34.789 --> 41:36.789
Here we go again.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.189
What did
the psychiatrist say?

41:40.189 --> 41:42.389
He says you're not suicidal,

41:42.549 --> 41:44.069
you're not
clinically depressed,

41:44.229 --> 41:46.389
and you have the right
to refuse treatment.

41:46.549 --> 41:48.549
Finally, a doctor
around here who listens.

41:48.549 --> 41:50.389
But refusing treatment
is just the first step.

41:50.389 --> 41:51.669
We need to walk you
through the rest.

41:51.829 --> 41:54.149
The rest of what?
He means the hospice.

41:54.149 --> 41:55.389
If that's the path
you're choosing.

41:55.389 --> 41:56.749
Yeah, it is.

41:56.909 --> 42:00.749
You know, contents of your bowel
could spill into your abdomen

42:00.829 --> 42:02.629
and cause a massive infection,

42:02.789 --> 42:05.869
get through your bloodstream,
infect your lungs.

42:05.869 --> 42:07.389
Which we will treat
with antibiotics.

42:07.389 --> 42:08.669
Fine.

42:08.669 --> 42:11.749
Your blood pressure could drop so low
that fluid could get in your lungs.

42:11.749 --> 42:14.229
We'll give you medication to keep
you comfortable.

42:14.229 --> 42:16.029
If you have to.
Morphine.

42:16.029 --> 42:17.469
Which will make you out of it.

42:17.629 --> 42:19.069
You won't be able to see.
You can't talk.

42:19.069 --> 42:21.149
Your daughter will be there
watching you lose

42:21.149 --> 42:22.749
the ability to breathe.
You want that? You want

42:22.869 --> 42:24.029
to put your daughter
through that?

42:24.029 --> 42:26.229
Your granddaughters through that?
Tony.

42:26.229 --> 42:28.989
Can you step outside, please?

42:35.989 --> 42:38.029
What the hell was that?
He's making a mistake.

42:38.029 --> 42:40.189
So you think scaring him into it
is the best solution?

42:40.189 --> 42:42.749
What other choice do I have?
Let it go.

When it's vital you're in control,

45:14.908 --> 45:16.948
don't be held back by heartburn
and indigestion.

45:17.028 --> 45:18.908
Count on Gaviscon Double Action.

45:18.988 --> 45:20.348
A powerful formula

45:20.428 --> 45:22.268
that soothes burning pain.

45:22.348 --> 45:23.748
Plus the extra power

45:23.828 --> 45:25.548
of two acid neutralisers.

45:25.628 --> 45:26.908
For powerful relief

45:27.028 --> 45:28.828
you can
really feel.

45:31.228 --> 45:32.748
When you're
constipated,

45:32.828 --> 45:34.548
your stomach's full of waste food,

45:34.628 --> 45:35.828
just like this bag.

45:35.908 --> 45:36.908
And, every time you eat,

45:36.988 --> 45:38.628
it weighs you down more and more.

45:38.708 --> 45:39.948
So try Senokot

45:40.028 --> 45:41.188
to help restore the flow

45:41.308 --> 45:43.508
of your
digestive system.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.308

45:45.428 --> 45:48.428

What is it?

47:59.428 --> 48:01.788
I want to apologise
for earlier.

48:05.268 --> 48:07.428
I watched my wife...

48:07.428 --> 48:10.748
turn into a corpse
before my very eyes.

48:11.748 --> 48:13.708
What makes you think

48:13.868 --> 48:16.867
I can't handle a little, uh,
shortness of breath?

48:19.147 --> 48:21.227
Hey, you, uh...

48:21.347 --> 48:23.027
you religious or something?

48:28.467 --> 48:31.587
Huh. Well, why-why can't I, uh,

48:31.747 --> 48:34.067
show my family
that I'm still strong?

48:34.067 --> 48:35.867
That, uh, I can, uh,

48:36.027 --> 48:39.067
leave this world
with some kind of dignity?

48:39.067 --> 48:42.947
You want to protect your family;
I get it.

48:43.067 --> 48:46.867
You know, I sat with my wife...

48:46.987 --> 48:49.547
for two years...

48:49.667 --> 48:52.987
waiting, watching her...

48:53.067 --> 48:55.227
disappear.

48:55.227 --> 48:58.387
I did that so that
my family didn't have to.

48:58.387 --> 49:00.347
Two years.

49:03.107 --> 49:04.667
And then when it was over, sh...
(chuckles)

49:04.827 --> 49:06.907
She didn't even
remember who I was.

49:06.907 --> 49:10.627
What kind of cruel joke is that?

49:12.667 --> 49:14.267
Leo, you don't have cancer.

49:14.427 --> 49:15.587
We could fix this, man.

49:15.747 --> 49:17.587
Ah, you did
what you need to do.

49:17.587 --> 49:20.787
Now you just... let me do mine.

49:23.987 --> 49:25.067
(sighs)

49:25.227 --> 49:26.667
I was talking to your
granddaughter Alyssa.

49:26.787 --> 49:27.987
Yep.

49:28.147 --> 49:30.707
She's going to, uh, Wisconsin

to get into, huh?

49:39.387 --> 49:40.267
Yeah.

49:40.427 --> 49:41.627
She said she
talked about it,

49:41.787 --> 49:43.267
when she was
a kid with you,

49:43.467 --> 49:44.747
that you wanted to
do the same thing.

49:44.907 --> 49:46.347
They never had
anything like that

49:46.467 --> 49:48.307

Oh.

49:57.907 --> 49:59.907
I'm proud
of all my grandchildren.

49:59.907 --> 50:02.507
They always remember
what they come from.

50:04.987 --> 50:06.507
You know, I have a daughter.

50:06.507 --> 50:08.667
Oh, yeah?

50:08.667 --> 50:10.347
Haven't always done
the right thing.

50:10.347 --> 50:13.547
That's for sure.

50:13.547 --> 50:16.227
Seeing you with your family,
meeting them

50:16.307 --> 50:19.587

50:19.747 --> 50:21.827
all that you've
accomplished, it's...

50:25.107 --> 50:26.867
You figure it out as you go.

50:27.707 --> 50:29.227
Yeah.

50:29.227 --> 50:32.267
The college,
the classes, the career.

50:32.267 --> 50:35.907
You-you've talked to her about
that your whole life. That's cool.

50:35.907 --> 50:37.347
And she's doing it.
Mm-hmm.

50:37.507 --> 50:38.787
She's doing it,
and she's doing it

50:38.947 --> 50:40.067
not just for herself,
but for you.

50:41.427 --> 50:43.187
She's gonna graduate,

50:43.187 --> 50:46.587
and she's gonna look out there,
and you're not gonna be there.

50:52.347 --> 50:54.747
That how you want it to be?

50:59.347 --> 51:00.827

51:25.387 --> 51:27.267
Here's a map and directions
to Lucy's school.

51:27.427 --> 51:29.667
You're responsible for getting
her to and from every day.

51:29.787 --> 51:31.947
And her paediatrician's office.

51:32.107 --> 51:34.907
She's got an annual physical
scheduled in two weeks.

51:35.067 --> 51:36.587
Can't some of this
wait until Joanie's better?

51:36.587 --> 51:38.667
No, it's important
to keep her routine stable

51:38.827 --> 51:39.787
during the
transition.

51:39.947 --> 51:41.707
Now, you need to bring
her here every day.

51:41.707 --> 51:44.387
Contact with Joanie is vital.
How am I supposed to work?

51:44.387 --> 51:47.707
You'll figure it out. Call me
if you have any questions.

51:51.027 --> 51:52.307
You OK?

51:52.307 --> 51:53.387
Yeah.

51:53.387 --> 51:55.667
Now, this is nothing
you can't handle.

51:56.867 --> 51:58.147
Listen, uh, Lucy's
with your sister

51:58.267 --> 51:59.547
until we take her upstairs.

51:59.707 --> 52:01.987
Why don't you go down the, uh,
street and pick up some food?

52:02.147 --> 52:04.027
Ike Ryan's is a block down;
shouldn't take you too long.

52:04.187 --> 52:06.467
Grab yourselves some, uh,
dinner, maybe a couple of sodas.

52:06.627 --> 52:09.107
All right.
You need some money?

52:09.227 --> 52:10.186
No, man, I got money.

52:10.346 --> 52:12.586
(chuckles) I'll see you
in half an hour.

52:12.586 --> 52:14.906
And, um, this is

52:14.906 --> 52:18.386
a bench, yeah,
where-where people wait

52:18.546 --> 52:20.306
to hear matters
of life and death.

52:22.026 --> 52:23.186
Oh, oh!

52:49.386 --> 52:51.186
Can you feel this?

52:51.306 --> 52:53.266
No. I can't move my legs.

52:53.266 --> 52:55.306
Spinal shock.
Probably septic, too.

52:55.466 --> 52:57.346
I'll throw in a central line.
Why can't I move my legs?

52:57.346 --> 52:59.226
You have an infection
that's pressing

52:59.386 --> 53:00.986
on your spinal cord.

53:17.866 --> 53:19.986
God! I'm going to be paralyzed?
No, we hope not.

53:19.986 --> 53:21.186
Don't worry. I've got you.

53:21.186 --> 53:23.986
OK, let's roll.
The clock is ticking.

53:24.986 --> 53:25.946

53:28.946 --> 53:31.586

Yeah? Yeah, Mom?

53:31.586 --> 53:34.506
Listen, do you have your
backpack and your sweatshirt?

53:34.666 --> 53:36.106
Yeah. Don't worry, Mom.
OK.

53:36.226 --> 53:37.226

53:41.946 --> 53:43.146
I'll see you tomorrow.

53:44.626 --> 53:45.906

Good night, guys.

53:57.746 --> 53:59.946
Bye, Dr Morris.
Happy birthday, Philip.

54:05.906 --> 54:09.786
You know, impersonating
a superhero's a misdemeanour? It is?

54:09.786 --> 54:12.786
And resisting arrest
will only make it worse.

54:12.786 --> 54:15.586
I guess I'm in big trouble.

54:15.586 --> 54:17.346
I guess you are.

54:17.346 --> 54:18.986
# When I die, Lord

54:18.986 --> 54:21.666
# Won't you put my soul
up on a train?

54:22.746 --> 54:24.466
# Won't you send it southbound

54:24.466 --> 54:26.666
# Give it
a cool bluesman name?

54:28.586 --> 54:31.106
# Cos I've been lost
on them back roads

54:31.106 --> 54:33.386
# So many times
I've gone blind

54:36.266 --> 54:37.986
# Losing faith in my family

54:37.986 --> 54:40.026
# Had put me
out of my damn mind

54:42.186 --> 54:46.266
# On the southside of heaven,
won't you take me home?

54:48.266 --> 54:50.986
# Cos I've been broke down

# Lord, it's getting cold

# Now the wind blows
every day, Lord

55:17.106 --> 55:19.186
# Oh, like a desert snow

55:21.186 --> 55:23.106
# Like a lostbound train

55:36.546 --> 55:38.706
# Lord, it's getting cold. #

55:38.706 --> 55:41.146
He probably went to get
his place ready for you.

55:46.306 --> 55:49.226
We can wait out here
for a few minutes, if you like.

55:53.826 --> 55:55.266
He's not coming.

55:58.866 --> 56:01.386
How do you know that?

56:01.866 --> 56:03.266
I could tell.

56:05.145 --> 56:06.545
It's kind of cold out here.

56:07.825 --> 56:10.185
I'm OK.

56:20.105 --> 56:22.145
How long is she
going to be here?

56:25.745 --> 56:27.025
It's hard to say.

56:30.065 --> 56:31.985
I hope it's not too long.

56:34.105 --> 56:35.705
Me, too.

56:45.705 --> 56:52.265
# On the southside of heaven,
won't you take me home?

58:28.545 --> 58:30.585
Let's do something good tonight.

58:30.665 --> 58:32.185
Just me and you.

58:32.785 --> 58:34.465
Dinner for two.

58:34.545 --> 58:36.265
We'll have Scottish salmon fillets,

58:36.345 --> 58:37.545
responsibly sourced,

58:37.665 --> 58:40.905
with baby new potatoes,
some fine green beans

58:40.985 --> 58:43.585
and a cuddle on the sofa for afters.

58:44.345 --> 58:46.305
Dinner for two, for:

58:47.465 --> 58:48.825
Sorted.

58:50.545 --> 58:52.185
Good with food.

59:23.665 --> 59:25.185
One of the issues
that dentists are raising

59:25.305 --> 59:26.505
is the issue of acid erosion.

59:26.665 --> 59:30.105
Acid erosion is really the weakening
and the softening of enamel

59:30.265 --> 59:32.425
caused by acid,
which is normally in our diets.

59:32.585 --> 59:35.145
That weakened enamel on your teeth
can be brushed away.

59:35.305 --> 59:36.705
It's very difficult
to see yourself

59:36.865 --> 59:38.185
whether you have
acid erosion.

59:38.345 --> 59:39.505
The teeth can appear
very healthy

59:39.665 --> 59:40.825
but have
acid damage.

59:41.785 --> 59:42.865
The first port of call

59:43.025 --> 59:44.705
always would be to go
and see a dental professional.

59:44.825 --> 59:45.905
I would recommend that you use

59:46.065 --> 59:47.905
a product such as
Sensodyne Pronamel.

59:48.065 --> 59:49.065
Replace your
normal toothpaste,

59:49.225 --> 59:50.185
twice
a day

59:50.305 --> 59:51.185
and it will help minimise

59:51.305 --> 59:52.225
the risk of acid erosion.

01:01:32.544 --> 01:01:33.544
You're leaving town?

01:01:33.544 --> 01:01:34.704
For one day. I'm not moving.

01:01:34.704 --> 01:01:35.544
Why?

01:01:35.544 --> 01:01:39.624
There is a facility providing
housing for cancer patients.

01:01:39.624 --> 01:01:41.904
I'm going to take a tour,
get some ideas.

01:01:41.904 --> 01:01:43.544
This has nothing
to do with Roger?

01:01:43.544 --> 01:01:44.544
Roger who?

01:01:44.544 --> 01:01:46.744
You know,
the architect with the wife.

01:01:46.744 --> 01:01:48.544
It's OK if you want to be
upset that you broke up with him.
