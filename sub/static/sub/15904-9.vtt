WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:04.072
When you think about it,
aren't we all special needs?

00:04.105 --> 00:07.007
I mean, we have this set of ways
we want to be treated, right?

00:07.041 --> 00:09.009
But the question is, is it real

00:09.043 --> 00:12.180
or is it just a reaction to life
constantly disappointing us?

00:12.213 --> 00:14.348
Of course, we blame
those who are closest to us

00:14.382 --> 00:16.984
for our misery,
instead of taking responsibility

00:17.017 --> 00:19.387
for being
unsatisfiable dick nuggets.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.190
We say,
"Hey there, person I love,

00:22.223 --> 00:24.525
I'm unhappy,
so clearly you're failing me."

00:24.558 --> 00:27.461
My wife is miserable,

00:27.495 --> 00:30.231
and instead of dealing
with her own malfunction,

00:30.264 --> 00:34.235
she fixates on some minor
financial trouble I had.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.471
So not only am I now not allowed
to spend more than 25 bucks

00:37.505 --> 00:40.808
on anything fun, she requires me
to haggle for everything.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.376
I'm a happy dude.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.977
But Bec,
she's this

00:44.011 --> 00:46.480
angry bee swarm. And instead
of actually pollinating

00:46.514 --> 00:50.118
some goddamn flowers,
she finds me enjoying life

00:50.151 --> 00:51.685
and knows she can't have that.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.287
So, buzz! Sting! Aah!

00:53.321 --> 00:55.223
Anyway, so how 'bout $40?

00:55.256 --> 00:56.457
It's $60.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.291
Had to try.

00:57.325 --> 00:58.492
(shouts)

00:58.526 --> 01:01.995
(moaning)
(laughing)

01:02.029 --> 01:04.965
You guys sure came
a long way for a bassinet.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.635
My glasses!
VERNON: Oh, when Bec
wants something...

01:07.668 --> 01:08.636
Doing good, bud!

01:08.669 --> 01:11.872
I broke my glasses!

01:11.905 --> 01:13.307
When's the baby due?

01:13.341 --> 01:15.309
I forget. Whenever.

01:15.343 --> 01:18.812
Hey, shoot me a text confirming
that I tried to haggle with you.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.148
Shotgun!

01:20.181 --> 01:21.549
I called shotgun!

01:21.582 --> 01:23.451
I'm driving.
So what?

01:23.484 --> 01:24.985
I still get shotgun!

RADIO HOST:
You're listening to Folio.
(harmonica playing)

01:55.683 --> 01:56.984
I'm Steve Cornelia.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.452
Up next,

01:58.486 --> 02:01.289
we'll talk to the
ambrosial Jay Becanerny.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.957
I've known Jay since we were
both fact-checkers at the

02:03.991 --> 02:05.193
(radio turns up):
New Yorker.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.894
The year, I shall not reveal,

02:06.927 --> 02:09.963
but suffice it to say
that we each carried...

02:09.997 --> 02:12.233

02:12.266 --> 02:14.535
(radio turns up)

02:14.568 --> 02:16.136
(clears throat)
Well, I have to say

02:16.170 --> 02:18.472
we've made good time.

02:18.506 --> 02:19.907
I believe we'll
beat my estimate home

02:19.940 --> 02:21.909
by 25 minutes or so.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.244
Road trip bonus time.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.512
Let's do a bunch of fun shit.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.180
First we got to get a Blizzard.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.216
You put some rum in it,
you call it a rizzard.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.351
If you put gin in it, gizzard.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.954
Put wine in it, it's a wizard.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.223
Yes! See?
(chuckles)

02:35.256 --> 02:36.624
This is what it's all about,

02:36.657 --> 02:39.793
family hang, making mad jokes,
dicking around.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.962
So boss.
I love it, I really do.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.332
("Lido Shuffle" by Boz Scaggs

02:44.365 --> 02:45.833
* At a tombstone bar

02:45.866 --> 02:47.368
* In a juke joint car

02:47.401 --> 02:48.636

02:48.669 --> 02:50.671
(singing along):
* Stop

02:50.704 --> 02:53.073
* Just long enough

02:53.106 --> 02:57.878
* To grab a handle off the top

03:22.936 --> 03:24.538
* Oh, oh

03:24.572 --> 03:27.174
* He said one more

03:27.207 --> 03:29.243
(sustained):
* For

03:29.277 --> 03:34.147
* The road

03:34.181 --> 03:35.383
Scaggs, check it.

03:40.321 --> 03:43.056
(music and harmonica stop)

03:43.090 --> 03:46.294
I did a list of cool
road trip stuff-- check it.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.562
Strawberry patch,
Pea Soup Andersens.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.997
You got to get some pea soup.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.400
Michael Penn is playing
at the Morongo.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.869
I promised Lindsay I'd be home
in two hours and 12 minutes.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.573
Fine.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.841
I'll get the gas.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.876
Thanks.
I'll get provisions.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.846
Get some Mambas
and some Red Vines.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.715
and some Blammos,
whatever flavor.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.750
But make sure it's something
really messed up.

04:15.556 --> 04:19.159
Oh snap, free blue paper towels.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.838

Shh.

04:30.871 --> 04:31.672
LINDSAY:
What?

04:31.705 --> 04:32.906
Hello, my love.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.842
You're on speaker phone.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.243
No, I'm not,
my ear's on the thing.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.845
(chuckles)

04:37.878 --> 04:39.480
We've successfully
picked up the bassinet.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.015
We should be home in
the next two hours or so.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.685
You're not here?

04:44.718 --> 04:46.620
What?
(chuckles)

04:46.654 --> 04:47.988
No.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.957
Don't forget,
Raul is coming at 7:00.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.726
That's tonight?

04:52.760 --> 04:53.894
Can you postpone?

04:53.927 --> 04:54.895
Can you pick up some lube,

04:54.928 --> 04:57.130
diet sun...
Lindsay?

04:57.164 --> 04:59.533
(Siri beeps)
Call Lindsay.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.502
SIRI:
I found Lind Ski Resort nearby.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.636
Ugh.
(Siri beeps)

05:02.670 --> 05:04.972
Call Lindsay.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.074
Dang it.
Damn, damn!

05:07.107 --> 05:09.009
(car sputters)
What?

05:09.042 --> 05:12.680
Don't! No.
VERNON: Stop it.

05:12.713 --> 05:15.048
Cut it out.
PAUL: Vernon, it's stalling.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.819
VERNON:
Oh.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.053
(groans)

05:20.087 --> 05:22.390
Great.
Nice job, fa...

05:22.423 --> 05:24.492
(coughs)

05:24.525 --> 05:27.227
I swear you can taste
each individual flavor

05:27.260 --> 05:29.397
in these
seven-layer dip Blammos.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.864
How do they do that?

05:33.667 --> 05:34.868
One, beans.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.236
Two, cheese.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.505
Three, guac.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.972
Four, sour cream.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.207
Five, salsa.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.476
Six, black olives.

05:42.510 --> 05:43.744
You sure you
don't have a signal?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.012
What's the seventh layer

05:45.045 --> 05:46.246
in a seven-layer dip?

05:46.279 --> 05:47.415
Why can't I remember?

05:47.448 --> 05:48.716
Come on, brain.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.652
Aw, man.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.954
Now I'll never figure out
what the seventh layer is.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.689
What's the seventh?

05:55.723 --> 05:57.625
This is a disaster.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.827
(spits)

05:59.860 --> 06:02.663
All right, if you could live
anywhere in the world,

06:02.696 --> 06:03.997
where would it be? Go.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.298
Where would you live?

06:05.332 --> 06:06.534
Go.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.901
Paul, go.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.970
I don't feel like
playing games right now.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.506
(spitting)

06:12.540 --> 06:13.974
What are you doing anyway?

06:14.007 --> 06:16.043
What's it look like, idiot?

06:16.076 --> 06:17.377
I'm messing with these ants.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.812
Would you help me?

06:18.846 --> 06:20.013
With what?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.248
We have no cell.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.750
No one's coming by.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.486
You're not doing jack.
(continues spitting)

06:25.519 --> 06:27.020
No, man.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.622
I'm thirsty.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.559
I ate too many Blammos and I
spat on these ants too much.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.060
You got any water?
I drank all my sodas.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.962
No.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.830
I hear a creek.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.533
You can't drink creek water.
It's not safe.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.169
Nah, I can't get sick.
To build my immune system,

06:42.202 --> 06:44.071
I lick weird stuff
at the hospital

06:44.104 --> 06:45.706
all the time.
In surg,

06:45.739 --> 06:48.542
they say scrub up, I just
fake go through the motions.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.810
Come on.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.712
That's to protect the patients.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.548
Agree to disagree.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.090
*

07:04.357 --> 07:07.060
(leaves rustling)

07:07.094 --> 07:09.129
VERNON:
How'd they get so mean?

07:09.162 --> 07:10.498
Both of them.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.799
Mean-ass sisters.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.133
We goofed, Paul.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.569
We married a couple
of straight meanies.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.672
My family growing up
was problematic, too.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.373
Is that right?

07:20.407 --> 07:21.675
I just said it was.

07:21.709 --> 07:24.344
Yeah, my parents
never bonded with me

07:24.377 --> 07:25.813
on account I was born dead.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.749
So, emotionally, they already
buried their son,

07:28.782 --> 07:30.718
but then oh, shit, dude's alive.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.352
Your parents suck, too?

07:32.385 --> 07:33.654
No.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.855
They were quite
advanced in years

07:34.888 --> 07:36.824
by the time I came around.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.458
My siblings were
already out of college.

07:38.492 --> 07:41.361
My nephew though, he's
six years older than me.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.996
He was like a father to me.

07:43.030 --> 07:46.667
He taught me a love
of the natural world.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.202
My nephew gave me
my first beer.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.470
Can you imagine that?

07:50.504 --> 07:53.473
(laughs)
Ah.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.075
Father was a kind soul,

07:55.108 --> 07:57.010
but he just
wanted to sit quietly

07:57.044 --> 07:59.246
and rest his eyes.

07:59.279 --> 08:03.884
Anyway, that's why I'm so
excited to be a young father.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.218
What? You're like 50.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.154
I'm 35.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.690
No. No way you're
younger than me.

08:09.723 --> 08:10.958
But I am.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.293
No way. That's insane.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.528
Ask anyone. That is crazy.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.963
Look at you. You're insane.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.131
I'm five years younger
than you are.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.499
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.635
Impossible.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.070
Yes!

08:24.171 --> 08:25.973
VERNON:
Water skeeters,

08:26.006 --> 08:28.909
I'm-a spit at you!

08:28.942 --> 08:30.310
(Vernon chuckling)

08:30.343 --> 08:32.980
Oh, my.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.381
I think...

08:34.414 --> 08:35.649
Yes!

08:35.683 --> 08:37.117
Vernon,

08:37.150 --> 08:38.552
it's a Squant-Billed Bushtit!

08:38.586 --> 08:39.452
A what?

08:39.486 --> 08:40.654
A Squant-Billed Bushtit!

08:40.688 --> 08:42.790
Oh, man. I can't even.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.725
Oh, look at him.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.561
It's rare to see a male calling
out of mating season.

08:47.595 --> 08:50.197
You see, once a male mates,
he falls silent.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.466
He spends all his time tending
to his mate and her chicks.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.036
Eventually, mute and unneeded,

08:56.069 --> 08:58.872
he jumps from the tree
and does not fly.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.307
You're harshing my swim.

09:00.340 --> 09:04.077
Boy, he would've been
a good find.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.714
Except I gave up my big year

09:06.747 --> 09:08.515
because of my unfortunate
knife accident.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.683
(laughing)

09:09.717 --> 09:11.551
Are you done?

09:11.585 --> 09:14.521
Yeah, I guess so.
I'm pretty full.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.523
Which way back?

09:19.727 --> 09:21.361
That way.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.396
(yells)

09:24.998 --> 09:26.700
Don't throw pinecones at me.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.501
You got us lost.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.971
You're lucky I'm only throwing
pinecones, shitlord.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.973
(yells)

09:33.006 --> 09:36.009
(grunting)

09:37.010 --> 09:39.012
(sighs)

09:39.046 --> 09:41.882
Can you just admit that we've
been walking around in circles?

09:41.915 --> 09:45.185
I've become too reliant on apps
in recent years.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.688
Uncle Nephew taught me
solar location.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.057
He'd put me on his lap

09:50.090 --> 09:51.524
and point to the sun and say,

09:51.558 --> 09:53.727
"That's the only tool
you'll ever need

09:53.761 --> 09:55.195
to get where you want to go."

09:55.228 --> 09:57.230
Normally, I'd slap
the shit out of you

09:57.264 --> 10:00.934
for talking like that,
but I am having fun.

10:01.669 --> 10:02.670
(grunts)

10:03.937 --> 10:05.538
(imitates explosion)

10:05.572 --> 10:06.907
Come on!

10:06.940 --> 10:08.175
We're men...
Hey.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.476
...out in nature,

10:09.509 --> 10:12.312
away from the sisters
Cottumaccio.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.681
Ugh.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.349
What a sonically displeasing
last name.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.551
Isn't it? They're lucky to
take our dope-ass names.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.387
Now, shh.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.222
I have to concentrate.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.024
As it is, I'm going to be
terribly late

10:24.057 --> 10:25.292
to get home to Lindsay.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.559
And Raul.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.961
What?

10:27.995 --> 10:29.029
She said Raul was coming over.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.030
Who's Raul?

10:30.063 --> 10:32.700
No one.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.367
TV repairman.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.236
Now, come on.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.171
This way.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.876
Is the seventh layer corn chips?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.544
Nah, that doesn't count,
damn it.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.890
We should bunker down
for the night.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.358
No, we can make it.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.293
Even if we knew which
direction to go in,

11:00.327 --> 11:01.528
which we don't,

11:01.561 --> 11:03.496
'cause your gross adult nephew

11:03.530 --> 11:05.032
clearly just put you on his lap

11:05.065 --> 11:06.800
so he could rub his dick
on your butt,

11:06.834 --> 11:08.635
it's gonna be dark soon.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.137
We have to make it!

11:10.170 --> 11:11.805
We have to build a fire, Paul.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.073
I saw The Grey.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.842
I'm not bottle-fighting
no woofs.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.879
(Paul yelling)

11:18.912 --> 11:20.881
(yelling continues)

11:20.914 --> 11:22.816
Aah!

11:22.850 --> 11:23.784
(gasping)

11:23.817 --> 11:25.953
(groaning)

11:25.986 --> 11:28.488
(panting)

11:28.521 --> 11:30.557
Now I'm not gonna
be there for...

11:30.590 --> 11:32.359
Oh...

11:32.392 --> 11:33.894
this is bad.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.396
This is very, very bad.

11:39.566 --> 11:40.868
Okay.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.138
We got a lot of work to do.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.207
I'm gonna build a pit trap
and catch some varmints.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.976
Whatever.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.044
I'll build a fire.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.345
Shoot.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.314
This ground is pretty moist.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.317
It's going to make
finding accelerant difficult.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.386
Booyah!

12:05.525 --> 12:07.727
(plays harmonica riff)

12:07.761 --> 12:09.629
* I am a doctor

12:09.662 --> 12:11.131
(plays riff)

12:11.164 --> 12:13.366
* I go snip snip

12:13.400 --> 12:15.135
(plays riff)

12:15.168 --> 12:16.736
* I rock that body

12:16.770 --> 12:18.538
(plays riff)

12:18.571 --> 12:20.607
* Or replace that hip.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.911
(chuckling)
Now your turn.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.512
Come on, it's easy. Just--

12:25.545 --> 12:26.847
just sing your truth.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.515
(plays harmonica riff)

12:28.548 --> 12:30.717
Uh...

12:30.750 --> 12:32.719
(plays riff)

12:32.752 --> 12:34.454
* My name is Paul

12:34.487 --> 12:35.956
(plays riff)

12:35.989 --> 12:37.891
* I am a human

12:37.925 --> 12:39.059
(plays riff)

12:39.092 --> 12:40.060
* I'm Vice President

12:40.093 --> 12:41.194
* Of Wealth Management

12:41.228 --> 12:42.462
* and Investment Strategies

12:42.495 --> 12:43.730
(plays riff)

12:43.763 --> 12:47.500
* Again my name's Paul.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.740
(chuckles)

12:53.773 --> 12:54.908
See, the blues is easy.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.844
I am so hungry.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.645
We got to get some food.
I think I'm gonna die.

12:58.678 --> 12:59.646
(groans)

12:59.679 --> 13:01.982
(stomach growling)
Ooh...

13:02.015 --> 13:03.783
Oh, great.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.485
My IBS is flaring up.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.956
Oh, okay, this is quite dire.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.557
I bet you're regretting
making me burn

13:10.590 --> 13:12.059
all those sweet paper towels.
Oh...

13:12.092 --> 13:14.327
Here. It's a receipt for gas.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.829
Hope your poop's small.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.230
Stay away from
my pit trap.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.999
Don't want you scaring
any future food.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.334
(plays riff)

13:21.368 --> 13:23.236
* Paul's going to poop

13:23.270 --> 13:24.838
(plays riff)

13:24.872 --> 13:26.874
* That cough could be croup

13:26.907 --> 13:28.241
(plays riff)

13:28.275 --> 13:30.143
* Salt and pepper same shoe

13:30.177 --> 13:31.378
(plays riff)

13:31.411 --> 13:33.313
* My wife Bec is a stu

13:33.346 --> 13:35.748
(continues playing)

13:44.524 --> 13:47.460
You sabotaged my car!

13:47.494 --> 13:49.029
(plays riff)

13:49.062 --> 13:50.297
No!

13:50.330 --> 13:51.531
I'm saying

13:51.564 --> 13:52.866
you sabotaged my car!

13:52.900 --> 13:55.202
You put diesel in the tank!

13:55.235 --> 13:56.636
(plays riff)

13:56.669 --> 13:57.971
(chuckles)
(grunts)

13:58.005 --> 14:00.073
(chuckles)
What's funny?

14:00.107 --> 14:01.508
You didn't wipe your butt.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.210
Gas was $3.27.

14:03.243 --> 14:06.146
My car takes 18 gallons, max.

14:06.179 --> 14:09.816
Total price should be, at most,
$58.86.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.120
Your total was $64.39!

14:13.153 --> 14:16.123
The only way that's
mathematically possible

14:16.156 --> 14:18.325
is if you put diesel
in the tank!

14:18.358 --> 14:19.659
Fine!

14:19.692 --> 14:21.728
Yeah, I put diesel
in your dumb tank!

14:21.761 --> 14:22.896
So what?
I panicked.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.564
I don't want to go home.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.900
This is, like, my last chance
to get out of my house

14:26.934 --> 14:28.701
and you're trying to end it.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.804
Why did I agree
to come help you?

14:31.838 --> 14:33.706
You and Becca are bad people.

14:33.740 --> 14:34.975
We're bad people?

14:35.008 --> 14:36.209
Your wife stabbed you.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.012
I backed into the knife.

14:39.046 --> 14:42.249
Why was she holding it
directly at you, then, huh?

14:42.282 --> 14:43.783
Face it, she tried
to murder you.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.053
You shut up, Vernon!

14:46.086 --> 14:47.554
You shut up right now!

14:47.587 --> 14:49.122
You shut up,
Rumpleforeskin!

14:49.156 --> 14:50.523
I hate you!
Your sunglasses

14:50.557 --> 14:51.791
look so stupid!

14:51.824 --> 14:53.126
You're not cool at all!

14:53.160 --> 14:54.727
(yells)

14:54.761 --> 14:56.796
(both grunting)

14:56.829 --> 14:59.232
You're going to die
out here, Vernon!
You're worthless!

14:59.266 --> 15:01.668
I will see to that!
You suck at everything!
You're gonna die!

15:01.701 --> 15:03.370
I'm strong!
I'm a strong man!

15:03.403 --> 15:04.371
I've killed so many people,
Paul!

15:04.404 --> 15:05.672
I'm not afraid of it!

15:05.705 --> 15:07.240
I am going to throw you
off this mountain!

15:07.274 --> 15:09.809
I'm gonna feed you to a bear!

15:09.842 --> 15:11.178
Ah! Not my hands!
Ah!

15:11.211 --> 15:12.479
(both yelling)

15:12.512 --> 15:13.746
(snap, animal squeals)

15:19.987 --> 15:23.190
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.492
Mmm, mmm.
Mmm.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.228
(smacking lips)

15:28.261 --> 15:30.563
Never thought squirrel
could be so delicious.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.299
Nuts are high in
protein and fat.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.667
Makes for tender flesh.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.404
People forget I'm a doctor
and I know shit.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.705
(sniffs)
Hey.
Mmm?

15:38.738 --> 15:39.973
Check out his little
squirrel dick.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.208
You dare me to flick it?

15:41.241 --> 15:43.110
Ugh...
(chuckles)

15:45.712 --> 15:47.580
I didn't know
we'd get lost.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.016
I was just trying
to buy more time.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.217
You don't understand.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.484
It's a nightmare over there.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.986
Becca makes me wear

15:53.020 --> 15:54.954
full pajamas
so our skins don't touch.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.824
Lindsay may have stabbed me
intentionally.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.459
I only get 20% of the TiVo.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.828
And Becca's always erasing
my shows "accidentally."

16:01.861 --> 16:03.997
I missed all last season
of The Librarians.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.665
Lindsay order takeout for one.

16:05.698 --> 16:06.966
One time I took a French fry

16:07.000 --> 16:08.468
and she made me
give her a dollar

16:08.501 --> 16:10.070
even though it was
on my credit card.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.305
Becca once held my head
in the toilet for a minute

16:12.339 --> 16:13.873
when I forgot
to flush a duke.

16:13.906 --> 16:16.343
Lindsey's cucking me.
Yeah, no kidding.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.477
No, seriously.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.547
That guy I mentioned
earlier, Raul,

16:20.580 --> 16:22.082
he's her bull.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.552
What? Whoa.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.554
What? So he porks her
and you have to watch?

16:27.587 --> 16:30.223
(groaning)
What?

16:30.257 --> 16:32.559
Damn, that's crazy!

16:32.592 --> 16:35.495
Jesus, why doesn't anything
cool ever happen to me?

16:35.528 --> 16:39.299
I was trying to be
a good husband.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.900
This is going
to sound bonkers,

16:40.933 --> 16:42.669
but why are we
even going home?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.537
We should drive
straight to Mexico.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.806
There's a thought.
No, I'm serious.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.475
We could just disappear,
start a new life.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.976
Things are cheaper down there,

16:50.009 --> 16:51.911
and I can find out
what the seventh layer is.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.581
Seriously! We're both
clearly miserable.

16:54.614 --> 16:55.848
What's stopping us?

16:55.882 --> 16:57.617
The impending children.

16:57.650 --> 16:58.885
No, that's bullshit.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.153
If a dad is miserable,

17:00.187 --> 17:01.554
he's no good for his kid.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.357
Look at Jimmy.
He hated his dad so much,

17:04.391 --> 17:06.326
he's actually happier
now that he's dead.

17:06.359 --> 17:10.130
Jimmy's dad did seem to be
quite a miserable person.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.465
Picture it--
Casa Vernon y Paul.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.001
Just the two of us
eating shellfish

17:15.034 --> 17:17.570
and drinking margaritas
and wizards.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.707
I could take bullets out of
cartel members on the DL.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.008
You can be their
accountant or whatever.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.811
We only get one shot
at this life, man.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.314
She is killing my spirit.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.149
This is our only chance.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.517
If we wait, it's going
to be too late.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.618
I'm in.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.885
Seriously?

17:32.919 --> 17:34.321
Seriously.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.223
I can't go back to that house.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.791
She doesn't even let me
self-stimulate anymore.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.561
I don't get to jack off,
either, not since Cassia.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.895
Let's reclaim it.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.531
Let's jack off
into the fire!

17:44.564 --> 17:46.333
What? No.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.667
We have to.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.736
We're not allowed to masturbate!

17:49.769 --> 17:52.672
Come on, we got to take back
domain over ourselves!

17:52.705 --> 17:55.208
And into the fire?
That is so manly.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.177
Okay.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.347
But don't look at me.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.050
(chuckles)

18:06.719 --> 18:09.556
Hell yeah! I bet no one's
ever done this before.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.690
Hush.

18:10.723 --> 18:11.691
What if it explodes?

18:11.724 --> 18:13.393
Shh.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.729
Yeah.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.466
Yeah. Yeah...

18:19.499 --> 18:21.534
(moaning)

18:21.568 --> 18:23.636
Oh there it is.

18:23.670 --> 18:24.904
(both moaning)

18:24.937 --> 18:27.607
(both yelling)

18:32.912 --> 18:35.148
BOTH:
Yeah!

18:35.182 --> 18:36.383
Oh, God.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.851
Oh...
Holy...

18:38.885 --> 18:40.820
We just killed, like,
a million of our babies.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.423
(both laughing)

18:48.395 --> 18:49.529
(animal growling)

18:51.164 --> 18:53.966
(screaming)

18:54.000 --> 18:57.003
I've been stuck!

18:57.036 --> 18:59.872
(yelling)

19:06.012 --> 19:08.014
(both groaning)

19:14.554 --> 19:16.989
(snoring)

19:20.327 --> 19:21.528
Wake up.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.866
(groans)

19:26.899 --> 19:29.736
My wound opened up.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.571
I have trouble clotting

19:31.604 --> 19:34.507
because of my
oblong platelets.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.909
Uncle Nephew had
the same ailment.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.212
I could close it with
some sap and a hot stick.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.981
We'll get you hella painkillers
when we get to Tijuana.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.683
I can't go with you.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.984
What?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.553
But Casa Vernon y Paul!

19:46.586 --> 19:48.888
I want to be a father.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.990
Last night, when
I thought I was dying,

19:51.023 --> 19:52.225
all I thought about was

19:52.259 --> 19:54.527
how I'd never
meet my child.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.863
Watching how
Jimmy's father squandered

19:56.896 --> 20:01.067
his opportunity and left Jimmy
such a miserable person...

20:01.100 --> 20:03.135
I can't do that to my offspring.

20:03.169 --> 20:06.172
Goddamn you, Paul.

20:06.205 --> 20:10.510
Regardless of what we do,
we're in a pretty tight bind.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.746
I can't see anything.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.348
(blows on harmonica)
How do we get out of here?

20:15.382 --> 20:16.549
I don't know.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.017
(harmonica playing)

20:18.050 --> 20:19.286
(bird chirping)

20:19.319 --> 20:21.654
(gasps)
Wait.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.022
Keep playing.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.124
(harmonica playing)

20:25.157 --> 20:27.660
(bird chirping)
It's the Squat-Billed Bushtit.

20:27.694 --> 20:31.464
So?
He'll lead us back to his
nesting ground.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.466
We'll follow
the creek this time,

20:33.500 --> 20:37.236
and we'll find a campground
or something for sure.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.272
(panting and grunting)

20:45.545 --> 20:47.714
Push me up!

20:47.747 --> 20:48.981
But keep playing.

20:49.015 --> 20:52.218
(harmonica playing)

20:52.251 --> 20:55.388
*

20:55.422 --> 20:58.825
Give me your hand.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.328
(harmonica playing, bird calls)

21:01.361 --> 21:04.196
Um, Vernon?

21:04.230 --> 21:05.865
What happened
back at the campsite....

21:05.898 --> 21:07.099
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.737
(both grunting)

21:16.943 --> 21:19.846
Okay.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.581
Thank you so much.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.783
No problem. You really should
sue the gas station guy

21:23.816 --> 21:25.785
for putting diesel in your tank.

21:25.818 --> 21:30.657
I would, but I think he was
severely mentally handicapped.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.859
(soft chuckle)
Where y'all headed?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.126
San Diego.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.797
Can I pay you for a ride?

21:37.830 --> 21:40.900
Yeah, sure.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.168
All right,
get in there.

21:42.201 --> 21:43.803
I know I mess around a lot,

21:43.836 --> 21:46.005
and I like to have fun,
and Becca thinks I'm a baby,

21:46.038 --> 21:49.342
but I'm really a good person
with a good heart.

21:49.376 --> 21:52.011
I know you are.
And I believe there is
someone out there

21:52.044 --> 21:53.413
who will love me.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.715
Hopefully a Mexican hottie
with big naturals.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.817
(chuckles)

21:57.850 --> 21:59.318
I'll miss you.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.887
Yeah?

22:02.889 --> 22:04.156
Me, too.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.932
Where the hell is the bassinet?

22:14.367 --> 22:15.868
It's not here.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.837
Goddamn it!

22:17.870 --> 22:20.573
That was my baby's bassinet.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.642
Someone stole my baby's crib.
She could've been in there.

22:22.675 --> 22:27.013
I will murder whoever did this!

22:28.948 --> 22:31.718
(sputters)

22:31.751 --> 22:34.086
I can't let a blind fool
like you drive home.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.890
Oh, yeah.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.192
That might be dangerous.

22:40.226 --> 22:41.794
Thanks, anyway.

22:41.828 --> 22:45.164
All right, get in.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.033
(car door closes)
I'm glad you're staying.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.969
Oh, I just realized I can't
leave everything hanging yet.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.972
(car engine starts)
Plus I need cash and passports,

22:53.005 --> 22:54.240
and I should grab some
medical-grade condoms

22:54.273 --> 22:55.875
from the hospital.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.978
They got some viruses down there
that will eat up your junk

22:59.011 --> 23:02.148
like a pig tearing
into a corn cob.
Ugh.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.850
Don't worry, I will
give you a signal

23:03.883 --> 23:06.719
before I leave
in case you change your mind.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.020
Okay.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.860
By the way, traditionally the
seventh layer can be anything.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.361
It can be ground beef,

23:15.394 --> 23:17.830
shredded lettuce, green onion,

23:17.864 --> 23:19.065
jalapeños.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.667
It's up to whoever makes it.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.069
Whatever makes them happy.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.671
You knew this all along
and you didn't tell me?

23:24.704 --> 23:26.372
(chuckles)
You dick.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.410
Mind if we stop
at the baby store?

23:31.444 --> 23:33.680
I got to get my baby a place
to sleep before I bail.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.381
Sure.
And we got to stop

23:35.414 --> 23:36.816
at the toilet paper store,
I haven't forgotten

23:36.849 --> 23:39.118
you didn't wipe
your ass, you cuck.

23:39.151 --> 23:39.986
(chuckles)
Hmm.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.288
(car door closes)

23:42.321 --> 23:43.890
(car engine starts)

23:43.923 --> 23:47.359
* One more job ought to get it

23:47.393 --> 23:50.162
(both singing along):
* One last shot 'for I quit it

23:50.196 --> 23:51.397
* One more for

23:51.430 --> 23:57.003
* The road

23:59.205 --> 24:00.507
* Lido will be runnin'

24:00.540 --> 24:02.074
* Havin' great big funnin'

24:02.108 --> 24:05.545
* Till he got the note

24:05.578 --> 24:08.648
* Sayin' tow the line
or blow it *

24:08.681 --> 24:12.552
* And that was all she wrote

24:12.585 --> 24:14.654
* He'll be makin'
like a bee line *

24:14.687 --> 24:16.455
* Headin' for the border line

24:16.489 --> 24:19.492
* Goin' for broke

24:19.526 --> 24:23.395
* Sayin' one more hit
ought to do it... *

24:23.429 --> 24:26.365
(dog barks)

24:26.398 --> 24:28.935
