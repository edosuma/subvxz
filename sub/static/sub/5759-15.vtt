WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.521
PREVIOUSLY
ON PRETI'Y LITI'LE LIARS...

00:03.630 --> 00:05.621
Hanna: IT'S MONA.
"HANNA WON, SO MONA LOSES."

00:05.730 --> 00:08.130
Caleb: MONA MIGHT BE SAFE,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
SHE'S NOT ON ON THIS.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.265
WE'RE DROPPING THE CHARGES
AGAINST YOU.
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

00:10.370 --> 00:12.634
Spencer: I THINK THAT
THE RED COAT THAT I WAS CHASING
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALI.

00:12.740 --> 00:15.004
AND THIS IS WHAT ALI
WANTED US TO SEE.

00:18.410 --> 00:20.014
Hanna: THEY'RE HAVING
A CELEBRATION TONIGHT.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.247
AND BOARD SHORTS THINKS
THAT ALI'S GONNA BE THERE.

00:22.350 --> 00:23.544
Hanna:
I THINK "A" IS A GUY.

00:23.650 --> 00:26.551
YOU NEED TO LEAVE RAVENSWOOD.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.549
WE'RE CRASHING A PARTY.
Caleb: I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF YOU GUYS BEING THERE ALONE.

00:29.660 --> 00:31.184
I'LL GET ON THE NEXT BUS.
Miranda: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

00:31.290 --> 00:32.291
CALEB.
MIRANDA.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.098
ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY?
IT'S COMPLICATED.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.120
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.
YEAH. I WILL.

00:36.230 --> 00:37.424
( gasps )
( heavy breathing )

00:37.530 --> 00:39.020
( grunts )

00:39.140 --> 00:40.664
Mrs. Grunwald:
ONE OF YOU HAS BEEN TOUCHED

00:40.770 --> 00:44.137
BY THE ONE
ALISON FEARS THE MOST.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.309
Hanna:
HELP HER GO FIND HER UNCLE.

00:46.510 --> 00:48.034
AND THEN FIND ME
WHEN YOU GET HOME.
I LOVE YOU, HANNA MARIN.

00:48.140 --> 00:49.573
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING,
ARE YOU?
NOT TONIGHT.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.477
WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME?
RIVERS.

00:54.350 --> 00:56.409
ALISON?
IT WAS YOU, WASN'T IT?
IN RAVENSWOOD.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.283
I WANNA COME HOME.
BUT YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

00:58.390 --> 00:59.288
WHO ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

00:59.390 --> 01:01.381
Ezra: ARIA?
SHH.

01:01.490 --> 01:02.184
( thunder rumbling )

01:10.200 --> 01:12.566
Hanna: WHERE HAS SHE
BEEN HIDING ALL THIS TIME?

01:12.670 --> 01:14.433
Aria: I DON'T KNOW.
Emily: DO YOU THINK
SHE'S BEEN HIDING

01:14.540 --> 01:16.064
RIGHT HERE IN ROSEWOOD?

01:16.170 --> 01:17.569
WHY WOULD SHE BE HIDING?
WHY COULDN'T SHE JUST COME BACK?

01:17.670 --> 01:19.103
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT.

01:19.210 --> 01:21.428
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY, WHAT DO WE KNOW?

01:21.540 --> 01:24.077
SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL ALI.
THEY BURIED HER
IN HER BACK YARD.

01:24.180 --> 01:26.068
RIGHT, AND THEN
GRUNWALD PULLED HER OUT.

01:26.180 --> 01:27.317
YEAH, LIKE A CARROT.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.513
WELL WHY DIDN'T SHE
JUST CALL THE COPS?

01:29.620 --> 01:32.214
WHICH COPS WAS SHE
SUPPOSED TO CALL?
WILDEN? GARRETT?

01:32.320 --> 01:34.550
ALI NOT CALLING THE COPS
IS THE ONLY THING
I DO UNDERSTAND.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.220
YOU GUYS, WE JUST FOUND OUT
THAT ALI IS ALIVE.

01:37.330 --> 01:39.218
SHE'S REALLY ALIVE.

01:39.330 --> 01:41.093
WHY AM I NOT INSANELY HAPPY?

01:41.200 --> 01:43.225
THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME.

01:43.330 --> 01:46.231
IT'S NOT.
LOOK WE CAN FIGURE OUT
HOW WE FEEL ABOUT THIS LATER.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.092
THE FACT IS THAT
ALI'S ALIVE.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.736
RIGHT. AND SHE'S BEEN
HIDING OUT THIS WHOLE TIME.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.569
MAYBE IT WAS IN ROSEWOOD.
MAYBE IT WAS IN PHILADELPHIA.

01:51.670 --> 01:53.228
MAYBE IT WAS IN NOVA SCOTIA.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.568
OKAY? BUT THE SOONER
WE CAN MAKE IT OKAY

01:55.980 --> 01:57.106
FOR HER TO COME BACK,
THE SOONER WE CAN
SIT HER DOWN IN A CHAIR

01:58.050 --> 01:58.379
AND ASK HER WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON...

01:59.110 --> 02:00.316
AND WHY SHE
WOULD DO THIS TO US.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.717
ALI ALWAYS LIKED GAMES.

02:01.820 --> 02:03.640
WHAT? LIKE SHE'S
BEEN PLAYING WITH US?

02:03.750 --> 02:05.308
CHASING US
AROUND THE GAME BOARD--

02:05.420 --> 02:07.251
LIKE SHE WAS "A"?

02:07.360 --> 02:09.453
TELL ME YOU'VE NEVER
THOUGHT THAT YOURSELF.
NO. THAT'S CRAZY,

02:09.560 --> 02:12.256
ISN'T IT?
WELL, WE HAVE TO CONSIDER
EVERY POSSIBILITY, DON'T WE?

02:12.360 --> 02:14.658
NOT THE ONES THAT MAKE YOU
WANT TO HIDE IN THE CLOSET
WITH A QUART OF ICE CREAM.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.660
THERE'S SOMEONE ALI
IS SO AFRAID OF

02:16.770 --> 02:18.465
SHE CAN'T COME BACK.

02:18.570 --> 02:20.197
WHO?

02:20.300 --> 02:22.234
TOBY SAID THE ONLY THING
THAT SHANA WAS GUILTY OF

02:22.340 --> 02:23.432
WAS SELLING JENNA'S CAR
TO MONA.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.405
AND CECE'S BEEN BUSY
RUNNING FROM THE COPS

02:25.510 --> 02:26.499
'CAUSE SHE KILLED WILDEN.

02:26.610 --> 02:28.271
WHAT ABOUT BOARD SHORTS?

02:28.380 --> 02:29.699
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THAT'S A REAL PERSON.

02:29.810 --> 02:33.246
IT WAS A REAL PERSON
WHO CAME AFTER ME
IN THAT HOUSE.

02:33.350 --> 02:35.545
SO CALEB DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING
IN "A's" APARTMENT

02:35.650 --> 02:37.140
WHEN HE WAS IN RAVENSWOOD?

02:37.250 --> 02:39.753
NOTHING.
IT WAS COMPLETELY
CLEANED OUT.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.454
GUYS, I WONDER IF ALI
REACHED OUT TO ANYBODY
BESIDES US.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.549
SUCH AS?

02:43.660 --> 02:45.252
SUCH AS HER BROTHER.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.554
MAYBE WE SHOULD
BE TALKING TO JASON.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.355
NO. W-WE ALL AGREED

02:48.460 --> 02:50.428
THAT IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS
TO TELL ANYBODY.

02:50.530 --> 02:52.464
WHOEVER TRIED TO KILL ALI'S
STILL AROUND.

02:52.570 --> 02:55.334
OKAY, BUT SUPPOSE JASON
ALREADY KNOWS SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.500
AT LEAST THEN WE WOULDN'T
BE THE ONLY ONES IN CHARGE
OF A SECRET.

02:58.610 --> 03:01.477
OKAY, I'VE BEEN THINKING,
AND I HAVE A THEORY.

03:01.580 --> 03:03.207
YOU HAVE WHAT?

03:03.310 --> 03:04.402
A THEORY.

03:04.510 --> 03:05.647
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR IT
OR NOT?

03:05.750 --> 03:07.479
( scoffs )

03:07.580 --> 03:09.389
GUYS, DON'T--
DON'T FIGHT IN THE CRYPT.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.288
HEY, LOOK--
ALI'S NOT IN THE BOX.

03:12.390 --> 03:13.357
SHE'S ALIVE SOMEWHERE.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.779
BUT SOMEBODY IS DEAD.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.585
AT THAT SOMEBODY MUST HAVE
BEEN BURIED IN THE BACK YARD

03:16.690 --> 03:18.248
AFI'ER ALI WAS PULLED OUT

03:18.360 --> 03:20.191
BUT BEFORE THE MEN CAME
TO SET UP THE "GAZE-BOH"

03:20.300 --> 03:21.824
AND POUR THE CEMENT.
"GAZEBO."

03:21.930 --> 03:23.693
WHATEVER I-IT STILL MEANS

03:23.800 --> 03:25.529
THAT THERE'S A GIRL
MISSING SOMEWHERE.

03:25.630 --> 03:28.235
AND THAT GIRL WENT MISSING
AROUND THE SAME TIME
THAT ALI DID.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.467
SO, WE FIGURE OUT WHO'S
REALLY IN THERE

03:30.570 --> 03:32.208
AND CONNECT THEM TO SOMEONE
THAT WE DO KNOW,

03:32.310 --> 03:33.709
THEN THAT WOULD
SOLVE THE WHOLE THING.

03:33.810 --> 03:36.404
YEAH, BUT THE BODY
THAT WAS IN THE BOX

03:36.510 --> 03:37.442
WAS IDENTIFIED AS ALI.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.642
HOW--HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

03:39.650 --> 03:41.515
I DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT IT WAS.
YEAH, SO, WHY?

03:41.620 --> 03:44.441
BECAUSE IT WAS IMPORTANT
TO SOMEBODY THAT
WE THINK IT WAS ALI.

03:44.550 --> 03:46.689
YOU'RE RIGHT--
THAT'S AN ACTUAL THEORY.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.485
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.557
KNOCK KNOCK.

03:51.660 --> 03:52.797
WHO'S THERE?

03:57.300 --> 03:59.439
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT? *

03:59.540 --> 04:02.259
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

04:02.370 --> 04:04.565
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

04:04.670 --> 04:06.831
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

04:06.940 --> 04:12.344
* IF I SHOW YOU THEN I'LL KNOW
YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

04:12.450 --> 04:14.714
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN
KEEP A SECRET *

04:14.820 --> 04:16.640
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD

04:26.660 --> 04:28.525
STILL CHANGE THE SHEETS?

04:28.630 --> 04:31.519
FRESH LINEN KEEPS HER ROOM
FROM GETTING MUSTY.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.663
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO ASK ME
ABOUT JASON?

04:35.740 --> 04:38.265
UH, I-I TRIED CALLING HIM,

04:38.370 --> 04:40.338
BUT HIS VOICEMAIL'S
ALWAYS FULL.

04:41.710 --> 04:43.405
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?

04:43.510 --> 04:46.718
( sighs )
PEOPLE REACT TO STRESS
IN THEIR OWN WAYS.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.812
I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY JASON NEEDED SOME TIME
BY HIMSELF.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.410
SURE.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.659
HE TOLD ME HE WAS GONNA
DRIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

04:53.760 --> 04:56.388
MAYBE STOP AND VISIT SOME
FRIENDS IN MONTANA.

04:56.490 --> 04:58.287
HE DIDN'T HAVE A SET PLAN.

04:58.390 --> 04:59.698
BUT I CAN REACH HIM IN CASE
OF EMERGENCY.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.824
IS THIS AN EMERGENCY?

05:00.930 --> 05:02.693
NO. NO, MA'AM.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.563
JUST--IF HE CALLS,
TELL HIM THAT I SAID "HELLO."

05:04.670 --> 05:07.389
CERTAINLY.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.400
I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT I CHANGE THIS COMFORTER,

05:09.510 --> 05:10.568
DON'T YOU?

05:14.680 --> 05:16.545
YEAH. GUESS.

05:32.530 --> 05:33.554
( sighing )

05:36.970 --> 05:38.858
( computer beeping )

05:41.470 --> 05:42.664
Ashley: NO, I UNDERSTAND.

05:42.770 --> 05:44.761
BUT THE INTERVIEW'S
ALREADY SET UP.

05:44.870 --> 05:45.905
WHY DON'T I COME IN ANWVAY?

05:47.580 --> 05:50.640
NO, IT WOULDN'T
BE INCONVENIENT AT ALL.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.741
NO.
( sighs )

05:52.850 --> 05:54.670
I...APPRECIATE THAT.

05:54.780 --> 05:55.974
THANKS FOR THE CALL.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.638
BYE.

05:57.750 --> 05:58.944
( phone beeps )

05:59.050 --> 06:00.756
( sighs )

06:00.860 --> 06:03.420
DO YOU THINK THE BANK
IS TELLING PEOPLE
NOT TO HIRE YOU?

06:03.530 --> 06:05.589
THEY DON'T HAVE TO.
PEOPLE WATCH THE NEWS,

06:05.690 --> 06:06.554
READ THE PAPERS.

06:07.530 --> 06:08.599
MOM, YOU DID
NOT KILL WILDEN.

06:09.730 --> 06:11.459
YOU'RE INNOCENT.
YEAH, WELL PEOPLE
MAKE A DISTINCTION

06:11.570 --> 06:12.935
BETWEEN "INNOCENT"
AND "NOT GUILTY."

06:14.040 --> 06:14.836
( sighs )

06:15.640 --> 06:17.437
DON'T WORRY.
THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOBS

06:17.540 --> 06:20.703
THAT WON'T CONSIDER ME
A PUBLIC-RELATIONS TRAIN WRECK.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.011
CALL YOUR FATHER.
HE WANTS AN ANSWER.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.940
I'M NOT GOING WITH HIM
AND ISABELLE.

06:32.050 --> 06:34.518
IT WOULD BE A LOT OF FUN.

06:34.620 --> 06:35.917
AUSTRALIA
IS A LONG WAYS AWAY

06:36.020 --> 06:38.022
FROM ALL THAT'S
BEEN HAPPENING HERE.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.894
WELL, ISABELLE THINKS IF SHE
GETS ME BELOW THE EQUATOR,

06:41.000 --> 06:42.797
I'LL BE FREED
FROM YOUR INFLUENCE.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.788
NOT MUCH CHANCE OF THAT.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.664
AND BESIDES, THE WATER
IN AUSTRALIA RUNS BACKWARDS,

06:47.770 --> 06:48.930
AND I CANNOT DEAL WITH THAT.

06:53.910 --> 06:55.707
Spencer: SHE STILL
CHANGES THE SHEETS

06:55.810 --> 06:56.799
ON ALI'S BED?

06:56.910 --> 06:59.049
THAT'S A NEW DIMENSION
IN AWKWARD.

06:59.150 --> 07:00.674
AND SHE WOULDN'T TELL YOU
WHERE JASON WAS?

07:00.780 --> 07:02.509
SHE SAID HE WANTED
HIS PRIVATE TIME.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.042
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THAT AND HIDING OUT?

07:04.150 --> 07:05.947
WELL, YEAH.
WHAT'S HE GOT TO HIDE FROM?

07:06.050 --> 07:07.813
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO ASK HIM.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.979
MRS. D. SAID SHE
COULD REACH HIM
IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY.

07:10.090 --> 07:11.819
SOMEBODY'S GO'l'l'A
KNOW WHERE HE IS.

07:11.930 --> 07:14.524
YEAH, BUT WE HAVEN'T
HEARD ANYTHING SINCE
THAT NIGHT AT SPENCER'S.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.029
FROM WHO?
"A" OR ALI?

07:16.130 --> 07:17.062
TAKE YOUR PICK.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.058
NO, I-I'M JUST
SAYING THAT...

07:19.170 --> 07:21.434
QUIET JUST MAKES ME
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.042
HEY.

07:35.150 --> 07:35.946
HEY.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.715
I THINK YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY HOLD ME RIGHT NOW.

07:39.820 --> 07:40.980
OTHERWISE
I'M GOING TO EXPLODE,

07:42.060 --> 07:43.584
AND YOU WILL
HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT
TO THE CUSTODIANS.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.849
YOU CAN'T LEAVE
FOR THAT LONG AGAIN.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.951
IT'S JUST A WEEK.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.527
NO. IT WAS MORE LIKE TWO.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.562
DID YOU GET ANY ANSWERS
ABOUT YOUR MOM?

07:54.670 --> 07:56.661
SOME. NOT ENOUGH.

07:56.770 --> 07:57.464
( horn honking )

07:58.740 --> 07:59.809
( horn honks )

08:02.710 --> 08:05.008
THERE WAS A TIME MONA WOULD'VE
DRIVEN RIGHT OVER US.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.715
SHE MUST BE MAKING PROGRESS.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.515
YEAH. SHE'S WORKING
ON HER AIM.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.581
Paige: I GOT OFF THE BLOCKS
REALLY STRONG.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.851
GOOD EIGHT FEET
BEFORE I HIT WATER.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.951
IT WOULD'VE BEEN PERFECT
IF I HAD JUST WAITED
THAT HALF-SECOND

08:17.060 --> 08:18.755
FOR THE HEAT
TO ACTUALLY START.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.798
I'M SORRY.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.026
SORRY FOR WHAT?

08:23.130 --> 08:24.927
TALKING ABOUT SWIMMING.

08:25.030 --> 08:26.634
I'M THE ONE THAT
SHOULD BE SORRY.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.607
MY HEAD'S JUST
BEEN SOMEWHERE ELSE.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.063
I'VE NOTICED.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.638
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

08:33.740 --> 08:35.139
NOTHING YOU
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.606
I LIKE WORRYING.
I'M VERY GOOD AT IT.

08:37.710 --> 08:39.644
IT'S OKAY.
DON'T WANT YOU
TRYING TO FIX ME.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.741
I'M NOT TRYING TO FIX YOU.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.044
JUST LET ME FEEL
WHAT I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW.

08:43.150 --> 08:44.014
OKAY?

08:45.890 --> 08:47.050
ALL RIGHT.

08:50.660 --> 08:51.888
HELLO, STRANGER.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.753
MONA.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.568
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT A RIDE IN MY NEW WHEELS--

08:57.670 --> 08:59.695
A VICTORY LAP
IN JENNA'S MUSTANG,

08:59.800 --> 09:01.597
SINCE SHE WON'T
BE NEEDING IT ANYMORE.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.008
KIND OF CREEPY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

09:03.110 --> 09:04.907
CREEPY IS AS CREEPY DOES.

09:05.010 --> 09:06.671
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.099
( grunts )

09:08.210 --> 09:09.973
YOU'RE SHUTTING ME
OUT AGAIN.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.547
I CAN UNDERSTAND THE OTHERS,

09:11.650 --> 09:12.719
BUT NOT YOU.

09:13.950 --> 09:14.974
I THOUGHT WE MOVED ON...

09:15.080 --> 09:17.583
AFTER WHAT I DID FOR YOU.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.043
THAT'S JUST IT, MONA.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.053
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU DID DO IT FOR ME.

09:29.730 --> 09:31.561
NOW...

09:31.670 --> 09:34.138
YOU ALL KNOW THE PLOT
TO JEKYLL AND HYDE...

09:35.840 --> 09:37.637
BUT YOU
DON'T KNOW THE STORY.

09:37.740 --> 09:40.038
Ezra: THAT HAPPENS
WITH GREAT WRITING.

09:40.140 --> 09:41.801
IT GETS TURNED INTO CLICHES,

09:41.910 --> 09:44.708
AND WE LOSE THE RAW POWER
OF THE ORIGINAL.

09:44.810 --> 09:47.608
BUT THE ORIGINAL,
IN THIS CASE, IS AMAZING.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.938
STEVENSON WAS SO CAUGHT UP
WITH HIS OWN STORY

09:50.050 --> 09:52.883
THAT HE WROTE THE DRAFT
IN THREE DAYS.

09:52.990 --> 09:55.185
( school bell rings )

09:55.290 --> 09:56.086
Ezra: WELL, LISTEN.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.928
CLEAR YOUR MIND OF ALL
THE KNOCKOFFS

09:59.030 --> 10:00.122
AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE
READY TO DISCUSS.

10:12.140 --> 10:13.129
MISS MONTGOMERY?

10:15.010 --> 10:16.079
CAN I SEE YOU FOR A MOMENT?

10:27.160 --> 10:29.219
IT'S WEIRD SEEING HER
TALK TO EZRA,

10:29.320 --> 10:31.254
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE KNOW
SHE'S SEEING JAKE.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.897
WELL SHE CAN'T SEE JAKE
WHEN HE'S IN HARRISBURG.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.150
( sighs )
WELL, IF ARIA WANTS
TO TALK ABOUT IT, SHE CAN.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.865
BUT I'M TOO OVERSTOCKED
ON WEIRD.

10:38.970 --> 10:40.733
'KAY. SHOW US
WHAT YOU GOT.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.637
( sighs )
ALL RIGHT.

10:43.870 --> 10:45.758
SO THEY FOUND THIS GIRL
OVER IN COURTLAND

10:45.870 --> 10:47.201
NAMED SARA HARVEY.

10:47.310 --> 10:49.778
SHE WENT MISSING
THE SAME TIME ALI DID.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.177
SHE'S BLONDE.
SAME AGE.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.168
HER PARENTS THINK SHE
RAN OFF WITH A BOY.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.009
AND HER FRIENDS
SET UP A TRIBUTE SITE.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.781
WHY DID YOU PICK THIS GIRL?

10:56.890 --> 10:57.879
WELL, I NARROWED IT DOWN.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.185
I MEAN, SHE'S SORT OF
ALI'S SIZE,

11:00.290 --> 11:01.655
THE TIMING IS RIGHT,

11:01.760 --> 11:03.284
AND IT'S NOT TOO FAR AWAY.

11:03.390 --> 11:06.757
I DON'T REMEMBER ALI EVER
SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT COURTLAND.

11:06.860 --> 11:08.122
WELL, SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT BROOKHAVEN

11:08.230 --> 11:09.788
OR TAKING FLYING LESSONS,
EITHER.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.663
SHOULD WE
TALK TO HER FRIENDS?

11:11.770 --> 11:13.192
OH, ALREADY DID.
I SENT THEM AN E-MAIL.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.790
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

11:14.900 --> 11:17.039
"WE THINK YOUR FRIEND
IS IN OUR FRIEND'S GRAVE"?

11:17.140 --> 11:19.802
( sarcastically)
YEAH, SPENCER, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID. DUH.

11:19.910 --> 11:22.299
NO, I JUST SAID THAT
WE HAVE SOME THINGS IN COMMON

11:22.410 --> 11:23.707
AND WE SHOULD TALK.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.971
IT COULD BE LIKE
A SUPPORT GROUP THING.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.947
WOW. YEAH.
HANNA, YOU'RE TWO-FOR-TWO.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.318
( music playing
over video )
WHO DID THAT?

11:33.420 --> 11:35.911
Male Narrator on Video:
SCHOOL IS AN IMPORTANT PLACE
FOR EVERY BOY AND GIRL.

11:36.020 --> 11:37.954
IT'S WHERE YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
COME TO LEARN WHAT YOU'LL NEED
TO KNOW

11:38.060 --> 11:39.925
IN ORDER TO PREPARE
FOR LIFE AND WORK.

11:40.030 --> 11:41.952
YOU DON'T JUST LEARN
MATH AND HISTORY AT SCHOOL.

11:42.060 --> 11:44.096
YOU LEARN HOW TO BE
GOOD CITIZENS.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.760
AND BEING A GOOD CITIZEN
IS SOMETHING YOU
LEARN NOT ONLY--

11:46.870 --> 11:48.064
Spencer:
"ALI, ALI, OXEN-FREE?"

11:48.170 --> 11:50.229
"WHOEVER FINDS HER
GETS TO KEEP HER."

11:50.340 --> 11:52.729
...IN THE HALLWAYS
AND CAFETERIAS

11:52.840 --> 11:54.728
BECAUSE BEING A GOOD CITIZEN
IS A FULL-TIME JOB.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.740
( sighs )
DID WE JUST GET DARED?

11:56.850 --> 11:59.171
DOUBLE-DOG DARED.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.147
...INTO ADULTS.
TELLS EVERYBODY WHAT KIND
OF AMERICAN YOU ARE.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.111
I WANNA SAY SOMETHING,

12:08.220 --> 12:09.118
AND I'M--I'M SAYING THIS

12:09.220 --> 12:10.323
WITH NO EXPECTATIONS.

12:13.130 --> 12:15.997
I PUT YOU IN AN IMPOSSIBLE
POSITION WITH MALCOLM.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.819
I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE
ALL THE PIECES FIT.

12:18.930 --> 12:21.091
AND...I DID THAT

12:21.200 --> 12:22.838
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA
HAVE TO GIVE YOU UP.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.832
THAT WAS INCREDIBLY SELFISH.

12:26.940 --> 12:28.908
I'M SORRY.

12:29.010 --> 12:31.149
NO. THIS IS MY APOLOGY.

12:32.980 --> 12:34.242
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,

12:34.350 --> 12:37.012
I THINK MY DAYS
ARE NUMBERED HERE.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.816
YEAH. MINE, TOO.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.252
I KNOW I'VE PROBABLY USED UP
ALL MY CHANCES WITH YOU,

12:42.360 --> 12:43.179
BUT...

12:44.190 --> 12:47.159
AFTER YOU GRADUATE
AND WE BOTH LEAVE THIS PLACE,

12:47.260 --> 12:48.921
I WOULD LIKE TO TRY
AND BE THE PERSON

12:49.030 --> 12:50.167
YOU THINK I AM.

12:53.970 --> 12:56.234
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'D KNOW WHERE JASON IS?

12:56.340 --> 12:58.808
HE IS YOUR SON.
HE'S MY HALF-BROTHER.

12:58.910 --> 13:00.309
PLEASE DON'T BE SARCASTIC,
SPENCER.

13:00.410 --> 13:02.401
THAT'S SORT OF LIKE
THE NATIVE TONGUE IN THIS HOUSE.

13:02.510 --> 13:04.899
( sighs )
HAVE YOU ASKED
ANYONE ELSE WHERE HE IS?

13:05.010 --> 13:06.375
NO, NOT DIRECTLY.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.869
HAVE YOU ASKED ANYONE
INDIRECT LY?

13:08.980 --> 13:10.379
YEAH. MRS. DILAURENTIS.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.048
YOU DROP THAT RIGHT NOW.

13:12.150 --> 13:13.117
I JUST WANNA TALK TO HIM.

13:13.220 --> 13:14.915
SUPPRESS THE URGE.

13:15.020 --> 13:17.352
( thumping on counter)
( sighs )

13:17.460 --> 13:19.826
SPENCER, IF YOU
THINK ABOUT IT,
YOU'LL REALIZE

13:19.930 --> 13:21.329
THAT IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S
BEST INTEREST

13:21.430 --> 13:24.319
THAT WE JUST SAY UNTANGLED
FROM THE DILAURENTIS FAMILY.

13:24.430 --> 13:27.160
DAD, JASON IS MORE
THAN JUST A "TANGLE."

13:27.270 --> 13:28.965
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT
TO TALK TO HIM?

13:32.140 --> 13:33.971
SINCE HE LEFT TOWN.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.036
I MEAN, I-I WANNA
KNOW IF HE'S ALL RIGHT.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.044
FINE. IF I CAN FIND OUT
WHERE HE IS,

13:41.150 --> 13:43.209
WILL YOU PROMISE ME YOU'LL STAY
AWAY FROM JESSICA DILAURENTIS

13:43.320 --> 13:46.039
DIRECTLY AND INDIRECT LY?

13:46.150 --> 13:47.879
I PROMISE.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.265
( sighs )

14:18.020 --> 14:19.089
( computer beeps )

14:24.930 --> 14:26.079
( sighs )

14:29.400 --> 14:31.288
WAS ALL RIGHT THERE
IN THE VISITORS' LOG

14:31.400 --> 14:32.992
WHERE DR. PALMER LIVES.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.965
HE'S A POPULAR MAN.

14:35.070 --> 14:38.005
I FOUND THE NAMES OF SIX PEOPLE
WHO WORKED WITH HIM AT RADLEY.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.862
WHAT MADE YOU THINK
TO LOOK IN THE VISITORS' LOG?

14:39.980 --> 14:42.107
I TRIED TO THINK LIKE YOU.

14:42.210 --> 14:43.973
( scoffs )
GOOD ANSWER.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.968
DID YOU TRACK
THESE PEOPLE DOWN?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.274
MOST OF THEM.

14:47.380 --> 14:49.268
AND MOST OF THEM
WANTED TO TALK AS...

14:49.380 --> 14:52.144
LONG AS I DIDN'T
GET THEM INTO TROUBLE.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.514
WAIT, SO THESE PEOPLE
KNEW YOUR MOTHER DIDN'T JUMP,

14:54.620 --> 14:57.180
THEY KNEW ABOUT WILDEN,
AND YET THEY
NEVER SAID ANYTHING?

14:57.290 --> 14:59.429
WELL THAT'S BECAUSE RADLEY

14:59.530 --> 15:01.896
IS OWNED BY A BIG
HEALTH CARE COMPANY:

15:02.000 --> 15:03.319
DECLODYNE.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.364
THAT'S WHO
PAYS THEIR PENSIONS.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.938
OKAY, BUT WHY
WOULD AN ACCIDENT

15:08.040 --> 15:11.066
BE MORE DAMAGING THAN SAYING
A PATIENT COMMITTED SUICIDE?

15:11.170 --> 15:13.274
AND WHAT MAKES THIS WORTH
BRIBING A POLICE OFFICER?

15:13.380 --> 15:15.177
DID YOU TRY THIS
DECLODYNE PLACE?

15:15.280 --> 15:17.498
LEGAL IS RUN BY THIS WOMAN
NAMED MAINWAY,

15:17.610 --> 15:21.148
BUT YOU NEED AN APPOINTMENT
TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.444
WHY DOES EVERYTHING

15:22.550 --> 15:24.313
ALWAYS LEAD BACK TO RADLEY?

15:24.420 --> 15:27.480
'CAUSE RADLEY IS WHERE EVERYONE
GOES TO LEAVE THEIR SECRETS--

15:27.590 --> 15:30.184
WILDEN, MONA, CECE.

15:30.290 --> 15:31.325
ME.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.296
BUT AT THIS POINT,
I WOULD JUST BE HAPPY

15:36.400 --> 15:38.095
IF SOMEONE WOULD
OFFICIALLY SAY MY MOM

15:38.200 --> 15:39.462
DIDN'T KILL HERSELF.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.205
DID YOU EVER
SEE THAT MYTHBUSTERS

15:44.310 --> 15:46.460
WHERE THEY PROVED THAT A MOUSE
CAN SCARE AN ELEPHANT?

15:49.480 --> 15:51.448
OKAY, SO, I TALKED
THIS GIRL TINA--

15:51.550 --> 15:52.972
WELL, ON THE COMPUTER,

15:53.080 --> 15:53.944
AND SHE WANTS TO MEET US.

15:54.050 --> 15:54.971
US?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.149
ALL OF US?

15:56.250 --> 15:57.979
YEAH. AS MANY "US"
AS WE CAN GET.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.216
I DON'T WANNA
DO THIS ALONE.

16:00.490 --> 16:01.514
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
BEFORE YOU HIT "SEND."

16:02.320 --> 16:03.958
EM, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

16:04.060 --> 16:05.129
THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER
WITH ME.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.095
WAIT-- ( stammers )

16:07.200 --> 16:09.156
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
THAT ALI'S ALIVE

16:09.260 --> 16:11.467
AND SHE'S COUNTING ON US
TO MAKE ROSEWOOD SAFE
FOR HER TO COME BACK?

16:11.570 --> 16:13.367
THAT'S RIGHT.
ALI'S ALIVE.

16:13.470 --> 16:15.233
SHE'S BEEN ALIVE THE WHOLE TIME
AND DIDN'T TELL US.

16:15.340 --> 16:18.059
SHE TALKED TO US
BUT SHE NEVER TOLD US
SHE WAS ALIVE.

16:18.170 --> 16:20.400
HEY, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO FEELS LIKE SHE'S BEEN
PLAYING "HIDE AND SEEK"

16:20.510 --> 16:21.408
SINCE JUNIOR YEAR.

16:21.510 --> 16:23.341
Hanna: YEAH. I MEAN,

16:23.450 --> 16:26.078
SOMETIMES I IMAGINE HER

16:26.180 --> 16:27.579
WET AND SCARED
IN A CARDBOARD BOX

16:27.680 --> 16:29.272
BY SOME TRAIN TRACKS.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.382
AND, OTHER TIMES I SEE HER
IN A PENTHOUSE,

16:31.490 --> 16:33.219
DRIPPING DIAMONDS
AND LAUGHING AT US.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.117
BUT...WE DON'T KNOW

16:35.220 --> 16:36.187
WHICH ONE'S THE TRUTH.

16:36.290 --> 16:37.325
NONE OF US DO.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.556
SO WE HAVE
TO BRING HER BACK.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.465
( soft music playing
indistinctly )

16:45.830 --> 16:46.467
( sighs )

16:49.200 --> 16:50.599
* SO DON'T SAY

16:50.710 --> 16:52.268
* DON'T SAY

16:52.370 --> 16:54.406
* DON'T SAY ANYTHING

17:06.350 --> 17:08.215
YOU GOT PRETTIER
WHILE I WAS AWAY.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.548
( chuckles )

17:09.660 --> 17:12.083
I'M SAVING IT ALL UP
FOR YOU.
( chuckles )

17:12.190 --> 17:14.021
GOD, I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.557
I'M SO GLAD TO BE HERE.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.058
YOU KN I SAID
I WOULD COME TO YOU.

17:20.170 --> 17:21.330
I KNOW. I...

17:21.440 --> 17:24.159
JUST--ME COMING HERE

17:24.270 --> 17:25.305
IS LESS COMPLICATED.

17:25.410 --> 17:26.604
LESS COMPLICATED HOW?

17:28.240 --> 17:29.377
I'M SORT OF...

17:29.480 --> 17:30.447
( sighs )

17:30.550 --> 17:34.543
KEEPING MULTIPLE PROMISES
TO PEOPLE RIGHT NOW.

17:34.650 --> 17:37.210
TRUST ME,
IT'S LESS COMPLICATED.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.639
WELL, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

17:38.750 --> 17:40.411
I MEAN, HOW'S MIRANDA?

17:41.620 --> 17:43.258
SHE'S GOOD--

17:43.360 --> 17:45.055
UM, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.599
JUST THE...
FAMILY STUFF WITH HER,

17:48.700 --> 17:50.520
IT'S, UM,

17:50.630 --> 17:52.393
EXTREMELY COMPLICATED.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.529
WELL, YOU FIXED THEM, RIGHT?

17:55.640 --> 17:56.595
I'M TRYING.

17:59.310 --> 18:00.709
( sighs )
THE THING IS,

18:00.810 --> 18:02.209
HANNA, UM...

18:03.480 --> 18:05.209
THE REASON I CAME BACK...

18:14.260 --> 18:16.080
I MISSED YOU.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.581
I MISSED TOUCHING YOU.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.095
AND I MISSED KISSING YOU.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.192
I MISSED WATCHING YOU
WALK BAREFOOT
ACROSS THE KITCHEN FLOOR.

18:26.300 --> 18:26.629
( chuckles )

18:29.640 --> 18:32.131
I THOUGHT I'D GO CRAZY
MISSING YOU.

18:35.340 --> 18:36.637
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

18:46.950 --> 18:48.611
( car beeps, unlocks )

18:48.720 --> 18:50.483
MRS. MAINWAY?

18:50.590 --> 18:52.751
Toby: YOU'RE
A HARD WOMAN TO SEE.
THAT'S BECAUSE I'M VERY BUSY.

18:52.860 --> 18:55.454
TOO BUSY TO SAVE YOUR COMPANY
A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS

18:55.560 --> 18:56.697
AND A LOT OF BAD PRESS?

19:02.300 --> 19:03.528
IS YOUR NAME CAVANAUGH?

19:03.640 --> 19:05.198
YES, IT IS.

19:07.210 --> 19:07.676
( sighs )

19:11.710 --> 19:15.669
Tina:
IT WAS THE FOUR OF US:
SARA, CLAIRE, AVERY, AND ME.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.418
WHEN SARA DISAPPEARED,

19:17.520 --> 19:20.409
IT WAS LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THE CENTER WAS GONE.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.579
WE KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

19:22.690 --> 19:25.579
YEAH, ALI WAS SORT OF
THE MIDDLE FOR US.

19:25.690 --> 19:27.590
Tina: SARA WAS THE REASON
WE WERE ALL FRIENDS.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.190
THERE'S ALWAYS THIS ONE GIRL

19:29.300 --> 19:30.699
WHO JUST SEEMS
TO BE EVERYTHING

19:30.800 --> 19:32.290
AND HA EVERYTHING.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.233
AND OUT OF NOWHERE,
SHE DECIDED TO TALK TO YOU.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.193
SHE MAKES YOU SPECIAL.

19:37.770 --> 19:41.274
AVERY THINKS SARA'S
STILL OUT THERE SOMEWHERE

19:41.380 --> 19:42.802
WITH AMNESIA OR SOMETHING.

19:42.910 --> 19:45.549
ONE DAY SHE'LL JUST
SHOW UP OUT OF THE BLUE,

19:45.650 --> 19:47.277
WALK BACK INTO OUR LIVES,

19:47.380 --> 19:49.348
AND WONDER WHAT
ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT.

19:49.450 --> 19:50.815
AVERY COULDN'T MAKE IT TODAY.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.512
SHE HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.689
DID THE FOUR OF YOU GUYS
EVER GO TO ROSEWOOD?

19:57.790 --> 20:00.224
YOU'VE GOT THAT FUNKY
LITTLE MOVIE THEATER.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.389
WE WENT THERE
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.365
Claire: IT'S LIKE SHE
KEPT US ALL ON HOLD

20:04.470 --> 20:05.562
WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED.

20:05.670 --> 20:06.728
LEFT US DANGLING.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.264
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
SHE DID IT ON PURPOSE.

20:09.370 --> 20:10.462
SHE DIDN'T.

20:10.570 --> 20:12.765
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HER.

20:12.870 --> 20:14.303
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
THINKS.

20:14.410 --> 20:15.809
EXCEPT AVERY.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.673
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO SAW HER LAST.

20:17.780 --> 20:19.509
ON LABOR DAY?

20:19.610 --> 20:20.713
DAY AFTER LABOR DAY.

20:23.720 --> 20:24.789
THE DAY AFTER?

20:24.890 --> 20:26.517
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL,

20:26.620 --> 20:28.611
AVERY SAW SARA RIDING
ON HER BIKE

20:28.720 --> 20:30.620
OUT TO THE BIG PARK
WE HAVE.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.358
THE FOUND THE BIKE
BUT NOT SARA.

20:37.060 --> 20:39.369
IS IT DIFFERENT...

20:39.470 --> 20:40.732
KNOWING SHE'S DEAD?

20:42.300 --> 20:43.608
IT'S DIFFERENT.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.405
BUT IT'S NOT EASIER.

20:51.750 --> 20:52.842
Mona: MR. FITZ!

20:54.520 --> 20:56.374
HI.
( mutters )

20:56.480 --> 20:58.619
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A BOOK
IN YOUR HANDS.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.711
OH, D--
IT JUST SEEMS THAT WAY.

21:00.820 --> 21:02.811
I WANTED TO TELL YOU

21:02.920 --> 21:05.388
I'M HAVING A LOVELY TIME
WITH JEKYLL AND HYDE.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.549
OH.
IT'S JUST SO GRUESOME

21:07.660 --> 21:09.355
IN A REALLY GOOD WAY.

21:09.460 --> 21:11.291
OH, I'M--I'M HAPPY
YOU'RE ENJOYING IT.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.890
I'M HAPPY YOU'RE BACK
TEACHING.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.467
SO AM I.

21:14.570 --> 21:17.300
SPENCER AND EMILY
THINK YOU'RE THE BEST.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.331
SO DOES ARIA.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.874
I'M A LITTLE ENVIOUS.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.305
"ENVIOUS"?

21:25.410 --> 21:26.809
OF THE OTHER GIRLS.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.616
THE SUPPORT THEY GET,

21:28.720 --> 21:30.813
HOW THEY DEPEND ON YOU.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.717
MAKES ME THINK
HOW MUCH BETTER I'D BE DOING

21:32.820 --> 21:34.879
IF I FOUND
THE RIGHT MENTOR.

21:37.760 --> 21:40.285
SOMEONE AT RADLEY
THOUGHT THIS SHOULD
BE COVERED UP.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.755
AND THEY GOT A POLICE
OFFICER TO DO IT.

21:42.860 --> 21:45.624
( chuckles )
THAT'S A GREAT DEAL TO ASSUME
BASED ON ONE DOCUMENT.

21:45.730 --> 21:47.595
WELL, THERE'S MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.839
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT,
MR. CAVANAUGH?

21:49.940 --> 21:51.601
I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW

21:51.710 --> 21:53.837
MY MOTHER
DID N COMMIT SUICIDE.

21:53.940 --> 21:56.431
WELL, I--
I DON'T REALLY KNOW

21:56.540 --> 21:58.349
HOW WE COULD HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.543
SOMEONE AT A SANITARIUM
YOU OWN

22:00.650 --> 22:02.641
PAID DETECTIVE WILDEN
TO ALTER HIS REPORT.

22:02.750 --> 22:05.446
RADLEY IS JUST
ONE FACILITY

22:05.550 --> 22:06.642
IN THE DECLODYNE FAMILY.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.752
WELL I BET IT
CAUSES MORE TROUBLE THAN MOST.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.856
A LOSS LIKE THIS--

22:12.960 --> 22:15.656
CLOSURE'S DIFFICULT.
Spencer: LOOK,
YOU NEED CLOSURE, TOO.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.660
PREFERABLY BEFORE YOUR
NEXT STOCKHOLDER MEETING.

22:17.770 --> 22:18.759
MEANING WHAT?

22:18.870 --> 22:20.462
MEANING IF WE'RE HERE,

22:20.570 --> 22:22.595
YOU PROBABLY HAVE MORE
PROBLEMS WITH THIS PLACE.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.463
MAYBE EVEN WORSE.

22:24.570 --> 22:25.730
IT'S ALL CONJECTURE.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.738
YOU CAN'T PROVE ANY WRONGDOING
WITH WHAT YOU HAVE.

22:28.610 --> 22:29.736
WELL WE DON'T NEED
TO PROVE ANYTHING.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.502
WE JUST HAVE TO GO
ON THE INTERNET AND SAY IT.

22:38.450 --> 22:39.712
THE DATES DON'T WORK.

22:39.820 --> 22:41.412
Aria: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THEY DON'T WORK?

22:41.520 --> 22:43.988
SOMEONE SAW THIS GIRL SARA
AFTER THEY POURED THE CEMENT.

22:44.090 --> 22:46.422
CRAP.
YEAH, "CRAP" IS RIGHT.

22:46.530 --> 22:47.849
(Ashley laughing )

22:47.960 --> 22:49.894
HEY, WE'LL
TALK LATER, OKAY?
RIGHT.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.763
( phone beeps )

22:51.870 --> 22:52.689
(Ashley laughing )

22:57.470 --> 22:58.630
HI.

22:58.740 --> 23:00.401
HELLO, HANNA.

23:00.510 --> 23:01.477
EVERYTHING OKAY?

23:01.580 --> 23:02.638
I THINK SO.

23:02.740 --> 23:05.447
I'M GOING TO WORK
FOR MRS. DILAURENTIS

23:05.550 --> 23:06.005
IN THE REAL ESTATE OFFICE.

23:06.110 --> 23:07.646
YOU ARE?

23:07.750 --> 23:09.445
I NEED SOMEONE
IN THERE.

23:09.550 --> 23:10.448
WOW.
( sighs )

23:10.550 --> 23:12.484
I WILL GET YOU THE COPY

23:12.590 --> 23:13.909
OF MY REAL ESTATE LICENSE.

23:14.020 --> 23:15.487
( Ashley sighs )

23:18.790 --> 23:21.657
YOU MADE MY MOM SO HAPPY.

23:21.760 --> 23:24.558
WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT SHE
WASN'T WORKING AT THE BANK
ANYMORE,

23:26.900 --> 23:29.494
PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
CAN BE VERY INTOLERANT.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.568
WELL, THANK YOU.

23:31.670 --> 23:33.831
IT WASN'T MY IDEA.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.703
ALISON SUGGESTED IT.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.548
( sighs )
WAIT--ALI DID WHAT?

23:40.650 --> 23:42.538
SHE STILL SHOWS UP...

23:42.650 --> 23:44.789
IN MY DREAMS.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.710
SHE WANTED ME TO HELP.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.811
SUCH A GREAT COMFORT,
SEEING HER.

23:48.920 --> 23:49.750
( sighs )

23:52.990 --> 23:55.527
YOU SHOULDN'T
SELL YOURSELF SHORT, MONA.

23:55.630 --> 23:57.996
YOU'RE A STRONGLY
MOTIVATED STUDENT.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.568
I'VE HAD TO BE.
I MEAN,

24:00.670 --> 24:03.559
I'VE HAD A RATHER
DICKENSIAN LIFE UP UNTIL NOW,

24:03.670 --> 24:05.558
FULL OF FOLLY,
AND GRUDGES,

24:05.670 --> 24:07.479
AND FALSE IMPRISONMENT,

24:07.580 --> 24:09.832
PEOPLE THINKING I'M ONE THING
WHEN I KNOW I'M SOMETHING ELSE.

24:09.940 --> 24:12.647
BUT YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT
THAT SORT OF THING.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.479
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

24:14.580 --> 24:16.844
JUST A FEELING.

24:16.950 --> 24:19.544
MAYBE IT'S THE BOOKS
YOU HAVE US READ--

24:19.650 --> 24:21.481
ALL THE MASKS

24:21.590 --> 24:22.682
AND SECRET IDENTITIES.

24:23.890 --> 24:25.926
THAT READING LIST
IS VERY REVEALING

24:26.030 --> 24:27.725
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT TO LOOK FOR.

24:27.830 --> 24:30.628
AND WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR, MONA?

24:32.730 --> 24:35.631
WHAT DID THE COUNT
OF MONTE CRISTO WANT?

24:35.740 --> 24:37.935
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO THAT MUCH REVENGE?

24:38.040 --> 24:40.600
YOU'RE IN THAT SCHOOL
EVERY DAY.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.507
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO ME.

24:42.610 --> 24:44.749
AND I KNOW ABOUT
SOME OF THE THINGS

24:44.850 --> 24:46.078
YOU'VE MADE HAPPEN
TO OTHERS.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.614
"HE WHO IS WITHOUT SIN,"
MR. FITZ.

24:53.690 --> 24:56.750
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT I'VE LEARNED
ABOUT ROSEWOOD HIGH:

24:57.990 --> 25:00.629
IS THAT FEAR
IS THE NUMBER-ONE MOTIVATOR.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.652
AND I WISH IT
WAS LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE,
BUT IT'S NOT.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.966
IT'S FEAR--

25:04.070 --> 25:06.891
FEAR OF FAILURE,
FEAR OF BEING DISCOVERED,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.560
FEAR OF LIKING
THE WRONG PERSON.

25:09.670 --> 25:10.705
YOU FIGURED THAT OUT,

25:10.810 --> 25:13.699
AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,
YOU DUMPED ALL THAT FEAR.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.569
AND THAT'S WHAT
MAKES YOU SPECIAL.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.001
"SPECIAL"? MOI?

25:19.110 --> 25:20.975
BUT IT ALSO
MAKES YOU VULNERABLE.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.914
SEE, FEAR CAN BE A VERY
GOOD THING, MONA.

25:25.020 --> 25:27.580
IT CAN KEEP YOU
FROM UNDERESTIMATING PEOPLE

25:27.690 --> 25:29.009
AND KEEP YOU
FROM MAKING MISTAKES

25:29.120 --> 25:30.781
ABOUT HOW FAR
YOU CAN PUSH SOMEONE

25:30.890 --> 25:32.585
BEFORE THEY PUSH BACK.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.999
HMM.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.022
( sighs )

25:40.840 --> 25:42.660
WELL,

25:42.770 --> 25:45.068
I KNEW I COULD
COUNT ON YOU FOR GOOD ADVICE.

25:45.170 --> 25:46.831
WELL FEEL FREE
TO TALK TO ME ANY TIME.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.778
SHE SAID SHE TALKS TO ALI
IN HER DREAMS.

26:00.890 --> 26:02.653
MAYBE SHE DOES.

26:02.760 --> 26:03.886
NO, IT CAN'T BE REAL.

26:03.990 --> 26:07.084
I MEAN, SHE'S TALKING
TO HERSELF, ISN'T SHE?

26:07.190 --> 26:10.091
I, UH--I'M NOT AS QUICK
ON THE DRAW AS I USED TO BE

26:10.200 --> 26:11.599
WHEN IT COMES TO REALITY.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.826
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:14.740 --> 26:16.037
IT'S COM PLICATED.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.903
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
SAYING THAT A LOT LATELY

26:20.010 --> 26:21.204
WHEN YOU DON'T
WANT TO ANSWER A QUESTION.

26:21.310 --> 26:22.902
"IT'S COM PLICATED."

26:25.010 --> 26:26.898
WELL...

26:27.010 --> 26:28.170
THINGS ARE COMPLICATED.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.741
MAY NOT WANT THEM
TO BE, BUT THEY ARE.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.855
ALL KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN
THAT WE'RE NOT EXPECTING.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.889
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

26:42.000 --> 26:42.989
TRY ME.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.127
RAVENSWOOD TURNED INTO MORE
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

26:47.230 --> 26:50.131
YEAH, I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD
THAT YOU'RE OUT OF THERE.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.731
HANNA, I MIGHT
HAVE TO GO BACK.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.603
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "MIGHT"?

26:54.710 --> 26:56.735
I HAVE TO GO BACK.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.649
NO, YOU DON'T.

26:58.750 --> 26:59.876
I DO.

27:01.180 --> 27:04.149
I TOLD YOU
I MADE SOME PROMISES.

27:04.250 --> 27:06.912
WHAT KIND OF PROMISES?

27:07.020 --> 27:09.215
AND DON'T SAY
THAT IT'S COMPLICATED.

27:09.320 --> 27:12.858
JUST...SOME STUFF
THAT I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.029
THAT'S ALL.

27:14.130 --> 27:15.825
( church bell tolling )

27:20.900 --> 27:21.764
( sighs )

27:23.300 --> 27:24.938
( sighs )

27:25.040 --> 27:26.837
YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT BEING A LAWYER?

27:26.940 --> 27:29.738
ONLY IN MY
WORST NIGHTMARES.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.876
HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT THIS?

27:31.980 --> 27:33.777
I FEEL LIKE
I SHOULD TELL MY DAD.

27:33.880 --> 27:34.869
YOU SHOULD.

27:34.980 --> 27:35.844
I WILL.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.913
GOT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
TO DO RIGHT NOW.

27:39.020 --> 27:39.918
OH?

27:40.020 --> 27:42.284
( door opens, shuts )

27:42.390 --> 27:44.051
HEY, DAD.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.252
HEY.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.258
TOBY.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.191
MR. HASTINGS.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.768
YOUR MOTHER'S WALL-TO-WALL
DEPOSITIONS,

27:50.870 --> 27:51.996
SO WE'RE ON OUR OWN TONIGHT.

27:52.100 --> 27:52.896
Spencer: OKAY.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.768
YOUR DAUGHTER
IS VERY SMART.

27:56.870 --> 27:57.939
I KNOW.

27:58.040 --> 28:00.702
I MEAN, SHE'S A GENIUS.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.209
RADLEY SANITARIUM
HAS TO ADMIT

28:02.310 --> 28:04.073
MY MOM WASN'T A SUICIDE.

28:04.180 --> 28:04.874
IT WAS A COVER-UP.

28:06.150 --> 28:08.778
"AN EXHAUSTIVE
INTERNAL INVESTIGATION

28:08.880 --> 28:10.711
"FOUND OVERSIGHT ISSUES.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.709
APPROPRIATE ACTIONS
WILL BE TAKEN."

28:13.820 --> 28:14.787
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HER.

28:17.020 --> 28:17.987
THIS IS DECLODYNE.

28:18.090 --> 28:19.318
YEAH.
( sighs )

28:19.430 --> 28:21.295
RADLEY'S BAD
FOR THEIR IMAGE,

28:21.400 --> 28:23.049
SO THIS GIVES THEM
COVER TO CLEAN UP.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.889
IF THEY'RE
ADMITTING THIS MUCH,

28:25.000 --> 28:26.228
THERE MUST BE A LOT MORE.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.888
YEAH, THERE IS.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.230
BUT THIS IS ALL
WE REALLY WANTED.

28:30.340 --> 28:32.831
MMM, THIS IS GOOD.

28:32.940 --> 28:36.034
SPENCER GOT THEM TO BLINK.
BUT IF SHE WERE A REAL LAWYER,

28:36.140 --> 28:38.244
SHE WOULD'VE EXPLAINED
THE SORT OF OPPORTUNITY
YOU HAVE THERE.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.739
YOU'D DO A LOT
OF DAMAGE WITH THAT.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.147
COULD SHUT
THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN.

28:42.250 --> 28:43.888
CLOSE RADLEY?

28:43.990 --> 28:46.117
MM-HMM.
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

28:46.220 --> 28:47.289
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

28:48.860 --> 28:51.055
YEAH. I DID.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.856
( birds chirping )

28:57.400 --> 28:58.765
( sighs )

29:00.570 --> 29:02.037
HI. THANKS.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.903
I'M--I'M SORRY
FOR CALLING YOU LIKE THAT.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.204
NO PROBLEM.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.831
CAN WE GO SOMEPLACE?

29:10.280 --> 29:11.975
I KNOW SOMEWHERE,

29:12.080 --> 29:13.968
IF YOU DON'T MIND A DRIVE.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.843
NO. NO. I DON'T MIND.

29:17.050 --> 29:17.880
OKAY.

29:37.840 --> 29:38.761
( thudding )

29:45.980 --> 29:46.878
( creaking )

29:54.190 --> 29:55.259
( pounding on door)

29:59.290 --> 30:01.292
CLAIRE?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.960
I REMEMBERED YOU
SAID YOU WORKED HERE.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.992
UH--

30:06.100 --> 30:08.068
DO YOU WANT SOME TEA?

30:08.170 --> 30:09.865
( insects chirping )

30:11.310 --> 30:14.177
AND I...CHECK ON IT
FOR MY FRIEND

30:14.280 --> 30:16.032
WHEN HE'S OUT
OF THE COUNTRY.

30:16.140 --> 30:18.802
Ezra: I WRITE HERE
WHEN I CAN.

30:18.910 --> 30:21.276
NO CELL SERVICE.
NO INTERNET.

30:22.650 --> 30:23.878
IT'S--IT'S CLOSE TO TOWN,

30:23.990 --> 30:25.412
BUT IT'S NOT TOO CLOSE.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.182
SO IT'S KINDA PERFECT.

30:28.290 --> 30:31.157
IT'S KINDA LIKE THE PLACE
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT ONCE.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.851
YEAH. IT IS.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.292
BUT BY THE TIME
HE OFFERED ME THE CABIN,

30:37.400 --> 30:38.128
THINGS HAD CHANGED.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.167
EZRA, I HAVE TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

30:44.070 --> 30:45.230
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

30:45.340 --> 30:46.864
RIGHT NOW...

30:46.970 --> 30:49.029
A TIME MACHINE.

30:49.140 --> 30:51.142
WE COULD...

30:51.250 --> 30:54.469
START OVER AND I COULD
AVOID ALL THE MISTAKES.

30:54.580 --> 30:57.378
SOMEBODY MIGHT SAY THAT WE
WERE THE BIG MISTAKE.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.141
I DON'T BUY THAT.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.888
I'M SEEING SOMEONE.

31:00.990 --> 31:02.059
I KNOW.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.378
MR. HACKETT WATCHES ME
LIKE A PRISON GUARD.

31:04.490 --> 31:06.048
I'VE NOTICED.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.357
AND...I SWEAR
I WOULD STRANGLE MAGGIE

31:09.460 --> 31:10.358
IF I EVER GOT THE CHANCE.

31:13.100 --> 31:16.137
( sighs )
IT'S--IT'S NOT JUST
THAT THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

31:16.240 --> 31:18.162
THEY'RE ALL JUST INSIDE OUT,

31:18.270 --> 31:20.135
AND I...

31:20.240 --> 31:23.232
I WAKE UP AND I HAVE TO LIE
THERE FOR A COUPLE MINUTES

31:23.340 --> 31:24.238
JUST--

31:27.280 --> 31:29.419
JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER
WHAT'S REAL.

31:36.560 --> 31:39.256
WE COULD HAVE THIS PLACE.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.384
THAT'S REAL.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.320
FOR HOW LONG?

31:44.430 --> 31:45.465
I DON'T KNOW.

31:47.330 --> 31:49.036
IT COULD BE OUR SECRET.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.455
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW WHY
AVERY WASN'T THERE TODAY.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.059
YOU SAID SHE WAS BUSY.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.162
BUSY SLEEPING.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.090
MOSTLY THAT'S
WHAT AVERY DOES NOW.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.395
THEY KEEP ADJUSTING HER MEDS.

32:24.140 --> 32:26.131
IT JUST GETS WORSE
THE LONGER SARA'S GONE.

32:27.340 --> 32:28.432
I'M SORRY.

32:28.540 --> 32:30.201
I'M SURE ALISON

32:30.310 --> 32:31.538
WAS A GREAT PERSON.

32:31.650 --> 32:34.448
BUT SARA WASN'T.

32:34.550 --> 32:36.518
SHE WAS PRETTY,

32:36.620 --> 32:37.518
AND POISED,

32:37.620 --> 32:38.518
AND PERFECT.

32:38.620 --> 32:39.939
AND...

32:40.050 --> 32:42.359
EVERYTHING SHE GAVE YOU,

32:42.460 --> 32:44.223
SHE TOOK TWO THINGS AWAY.

32:45.790 --> 32:48.099
I-I CAN'T TALK LIKE THIS

32:48.200 --> 32:49.997
TO THE OTHERS,
BUT I'M SAYING IT TO YOU.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.166
WHY ME?

32:53.800 --> 32:56.439
SEEING YOU TODAY
MADE ME SO JEALOUS.

32:56.540 --> 32:58.167
"J EALOUS"?

32:59.370 --> 33:01.270
THAT YOUR FRIEND
IS DEAD.

33:02.510 --> 33:05.047
I'M SORRY.
I'M TERRIBLE.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.471
BUT THAT'S WHAT
I KEEP THINKING.

33:07.580 --> 33:09.309
YOU'RE DONE. YOU'VE--

33:09.420 --> 33:11.980
YOU'VE GOT YOUR LIFE BACK.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.011
NOT US.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.511
SHE'S GONE

33:15.620 --> 33:17.156
BUT SHE'S NOT GONE.

33:17.260 --> 33:20.286
AND WE CAN'T
GET AWAY FROM HER.

33:20.390 --> 33:23.427
AND I'M SO TIRED
OF BEING SARA'S FRIEND.

33:23.530 --> 33:26.465
JUST...SUCKS THE LIFE
OUT OF YOU.

33:28.370 --> 33:30.031
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.

33:32.410 --> 33:34.002
NO, YOU DON'T.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.174
I WISHED SARA WAS DEAD

33:38.280 --> 33:39.474
BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED.

33:42.380 --> 33:44.484
I TOLD YOU
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

33:46.350 --> 33:49.148
( door opens, shuts )

33:52.260 --> 33:54.296
I HAVE TO GO.
NO, YOU DON'T.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.322
IT'S TIME.
NO! IT'S NOT.

33:56.430 --> 33:58.261
YOUR WATCH IS BROKEN.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.167
IT'S LATE.

34:00.270 --> 34:01.237
( scoffs )

34:02.500 --> 34:04.434
WELL THEN TAKE ME WITH YOU.

34:04.540 --> 34:05.507
I CAN'T.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.032
THEN I'LL FOLLOW YOU.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.072
DON'T.

34:12.310 --> 34:13.072
( sighs )

34:15.620 --> 34:17.269
( sighs )

34:18.520 --> 34:20.511
IS THIS ABOUT MIRANDA?

34:20.620 --> 34:21.587
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

34:21.690 --> 34:23.180
LIKE WHAT?

34:23.290 --> 34:24.279
LIKE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

34:24.390 --> 34:26.426
WHAT AM I THINKING?

34:26.530 --> 34:28.259
I MEAN, I-IS THIS

34:28.360 --> 34:30.225
ABOUT THE GIRL I TOLD YOU
TO LOOK AFTER?

34:33.330 --> 34:34.558
SHE NEEDS ME.

34:36.540 --> 34:39.407
BUT IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT SOUNDS.

34:39.510 --> 34:42.331
YOU SAY THAT, BUT WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK?

34:42.440 --> 34:44.647
I-I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT TO THINK.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.638
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M THINKING.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.411
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
I HAVE TO GO,

34:48.520 --> 34:50.272
AND YOU HAVE TO SAY.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.382
IT'S BEST FOR THE BOTH
OF US.

34:52.490 --> 34:53.343
( sighs )

34:56.690 --> 34:58.089
( door opens )

34:59.160 --> 35:00.252
HAN NA.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.497
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.249
DO WHAT?

35:03.360 --> 35:04.691
WHAT AM I DOING?
I-I'M STANDING IN FRONT

35:04.800 --> 35:07.121
OF MY OWN DOOR
IN MY OWN HOUSE.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.629
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO GO.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.607
WHY AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE THIS
SO EASY FOR YOU?

35:11.710 --> 35:13.701
THIS IS NOT EASY.

35:19.610 --> 35:21.168
( sighs )
GOD,

35:21.280 --> 35:23.214
I GAVE HER TO YOU.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.389
( sighs )

35:24.490 --> 35:25.616
I'M SO STUPID.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.608
YOU ARE NOT STUPID.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.608
THAT IS NOT
WHAT HAPPENED.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.223
WELL THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.358
I CAN'T.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.722
( breathing heavily)

35:46.240 --> 35:48.128
IS THIS HOW IT WORKS?

35:49.540 --> 35:50.677
THEY JUST LEAVE?

35:52.580 --> 35:54.548
"IT'S NOT YOU;
IT'S ME."

35:54.650 --> 35:55.639
AND THEN...

35:55.750 --> 35:57.308
THEY'RE JUST OUT THE DOOR.

35:58.350 --> 35:59.317
NO.

36:00.550 --> 36:01.357
( sighs )

36:02.560 --> 36:04.357
( sobbing )

36:11.370 --> 36:12.769
( sighs )

36:17.440 --> 36:18.702
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:19.710 --> 36:21.530
JUST TRYING TO HELP.

36:21.640 --> 36:22.607
TOBY DOESN'T WANT YOUR HELP.

36:23.710 --> 36:25.439
NO, I THINK HE DOES.

36:25.550 --> 36:27.245
NOW.

36:27.350 --> 36:30.672
WHY ARE YOU
SUDDENLY SO INTERESTED
IN CLOSING DOWN RADLEY?

36:30.780 --> 36:33.419
MMM, ACTUALLY BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT FOR QUITE A WHILE.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.715
PLACE IS OUTDATED
AND DANGEROUS.

36:35.820 --> 36:38.459
TOBY'S MOTHER PROBABLY ISN'T
THE ONLY VICTIM OF THAT PLACE.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.357
YOU FIGURED THAT OUT.

36:40.460 --> 36:42.496
IT'S WHY YOU WERE ABLE
TO LEVERAGE THAT LETTER
OUT OF THEM.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.761
SO WHAT DO YOU GET
OUT OF THIS PUBLIC SERVICE?

36:44.870 --> 36:47.725
( sighs )
SPENCER, I SAW YOU
IN THAT PLACE.

36:47.830 --> 36:49.695
YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOU WOULDN'T
LIKE TO SEE IT TAKEN APART

36:49.800 --> 36:50.789
BRICK BY BRICK.

36:52.470 --> 36:53.767
SO YOU'RE
DOING THIS FOR ME?

36:59.350 --> 37:01.614
I ALWAYS DO WHAT'S BEST
FOR MY FAMILY.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.782
ALI LET ME
KISS HER...ONCE.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.755
I'M NOT SO SURE
I WANT TO HEAR THIS.

37:48.860 --> 37:50.657
I'M NOT SO SURE
I WANT TO TELL YOU,

37:50.760 --> 37:52.523
BUT...I HAVE
TO SAY IT OUT LOUD.

37:53.770 --> 37:55.328
SHE LET ME KISS HER,

37:55.440 --> 37:58.659
AND...I THOUGHT IT
WAS THIS INCREDIBLE GIFT.

37:59.710 --> 38:00.859
NOW I KNOW IT WASN'T.

38:00.970 --> 38:02.835
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?

38:02.940 --> 38:05.807
I REALIZED IT DIDN'T
MEAN ANYTHING TO HER.

38:08.550 --> 38:11.314
I DON'T THINK SHE
EVER LOVED ANYBODY.

38:11.420 --> 38:12.887
I DON'T THINK
SHE KNEW HOW.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.410
( stammers )

38:15.520 --> 38:17.852
SHE JUST COLLECTED LOVE
FROM OTHER PEOPLE.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.326
SHE'S BEEN GONE SO LONG,

38:20.430 --> 38:21.749
AND YOU'RE STILL
THINKING ABOUT HER.

38:21.860 --> 38:23.452
BECAUSE SHE BROKE MY HEART.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.429
I MEAN, REALLY--

38:27.530 --> 38:29.430
LIKE, I-I COULD
HEAR IT CRACK

38:29.540 --> 38:31.337
INSIDE ME.

38:31.440 --> 38:32.634
I HATE HER FOR BEING
SO MEAN TO YOU,

38:32.740 --> 38:34.298
SO CRUEL.

38:35.710 --> 38:38.440
CRUEL WOULD MEAN
SHE CARED WHAT SHE WAS DOING.

38:38.550 --> 38:39.903
I DON'T THINK SHE DID.

38:43.980 --> 38:46.619
IS THIS HOW YOU FINALLY
START TO SAY "GOOD-BYE" TO HER?

38:48.860 --> 38:50.418
I GUESS IT IS.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.558
*

39:02.700 --> 39:05.703
* GONNA RIDE THIS TRAIN

39:05.810 --> 39:07.801
* UNTIL YOU NEED A RIDE

39:12.980 --> 39:15.915
* 'CAUSE NEW YORK
NEVER FELT SO BIG *

39:16.020 --> 39:18.739
* AS IT DID TONIGHT

39:20.850 --> 39:22.886
( sighs )

39:22.990 --> 39:24.924
* IT'S SUCH A LONELY RIDE

39:25.030 --> 39:27.555
LOOK, WHATEVER HAPPENS,

39:27.660 --> 39:29.594
I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT
BE THE WAY WE SAY "GOOD-BYE."

39:32.770 --> 39:34.931
* IF ONLY IT WERE RIGHT

39:36.770 --> 39:38.465
( softly)
Bye.

39:40.670 --> 39:41.705
Good-bye.

39:44.810 --> 39:45.879
( sighs )

39:47.680 --> 39:48.715
( sighs )

39:53.550 --> 39:54.687
HEY.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.881
YOU'D...FORGET YOUR HEAD
IF IT WASN'T ATTACHED.

40:05.530 --> 40:06.997
I'M NOT GONNA
FORGET ANYTHING.

40:14.540 --> 40:17.509
* BUT IT
DOESN'T HELP TO HIDE *
( engine starts )

40:17.610 --> 40:19.601
* DREAMING YOU TONIGHT

40:19.710 --> 40:21.871
* ON THIS TRAIN

40:24.490 --> 40:28.813
* 'CAUSE TONIGHT

40:28.920 --> 40:31.923
* THE CITY HAS NO LIGHT

40:34.730 --> 40:38.928
* 'CAUSE TONIGHT

40:39.030 --> 40:42.796
* THE CITY HAS NO LIGHT

40:44.970 --> 40:49.839
* ONE LAST RIDE

40:49.940 --> 40:53.569
* THE CITY HAS NO LIGHT

40:55.820 --> 41:00.712
* ONE LAST RIDE

41:11.800 --> 41:13.825
Spencer: SO WE STILL
DON'T KNOW WHO'S IN THERE.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.989
WE JUST KNOW
THAT IT'S SOMEBODY.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.830
SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER.
SOMEBODY'S FRIEND.

41:18.940 --> 41:20.737
REST IN PEACE,

41:20.840 --> 41:21.932
JANE DOE.

41:26.710 --> 41:28.610
GUYS...

41:28.720 --> 41:29.914
ARE YOU OKAY?

41:30.020 --> 41:31.612
NO.

41:32.790 --> 41:33.882
( sighs )

41:38.630 --> 41:40.052
WHAT IS THAT?

41:40.160 --> 41:41.855
IT WAS ALI'S.

41:41.960 --> 41:44.121
SHE SHOWED IT TO ME.

41:44.230 --> 41:46.027
IT'S...SORT OF LIKE A DIARY

41:46.130 --> 41:47.893
BUT...MORE LIKE A JOURNAL

41:48.000 --> 41:49.069
WHERE SHE WROTE THINGS.

41:49.170 --> 41:50.694
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?

41:50.800 --> 41:52.062
I TOOK IT...

41:52.170 --> 41:53.899
FROM THE LAIR IN RAVENSWOOD.

41:54.010 --> 41:55.079
WH-WHAT?

41:55.180 --> 41:56.772
Y-YOU'VE HAD IT
THIS WHOLE TIME?

41:56.880 --> 41:58.905
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW THIS
TO US BEFORE?

41:59.010 --> 42:01.149
BECAUSE OF WHAT'S IN IT.

42:01.250 --> 42:03.844
BECAUSE OF WHAT
SHE SAID ABOUT US.

42:03.950 --> 42:05.042
ALL OF US.

42:59.810 --> 43:01.801
*
