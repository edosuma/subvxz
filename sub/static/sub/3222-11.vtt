WEBVTT

00:08.314 --> 00:09.679
- What the hell?
- Leviathan!

00:27.901 --> 00:29.095
Stay away from me.

00:29.269 --> 00:31.760
Your world is whatever
I want it to be, understand?

00:31.938 --> 00:32.996
Leave me alone!

00:33.439 --> 00:34.531
Whoa! Whoa!

00:34.707 --> 00:37.471
Know what's real? You got away.
We got you out, Sammy.

00:37.644 --> 00:39.305
This is real.

00:39.479 --> 00:41.106
You need to see Frank Devereaux.

00:41.281 --> 00:42.339
Bobby Singer sent us.

00:46.286 --> 00:48.550
You can't stop any of us.
We can't be killed.

00:48.721 --> 00:52.623
These are smarter. You don't have a clue
how to kill or slow them down...

00:52.792 --> 00:54.851
...and your plan is go right at them?

00:55.028 --> 00:58.828
Years of demons nipping at your heels.
Haven't seen one for months. Why?

00:58.998 --> 01:01.660
- We've been busy.
- Hunting Leviathan. Yes, I know.

01:01.834 --> 01:03.233
You met that Dick yet?

01:03.436 --> 01:06.564
- We should be friends. You and I.
- I'd never work with you.

01:07.473 --> 01:10.169
Okay, you sons of bitches.
I see what you're up to.

01:10.343 --> 01:11.970
Go, go!

01:12.579 --> 01:13.978
Page the neurosurgeon on call.

01:14.147 --> 01:16.411
He's not gonna die. It's one bullet.

01:16.583 --> 01:18.676
He's gonna be fine
because he's always fine.

01:18.851 --> 01:21.513
So maybe I'm not real,
but I'm not going anywhere, Sam.

01:21.688 --> 01:23.155
- His eyes are open.
- Bobby?

01:23.323 --> 01:24.813
Hey.

01:29.562 --> 01:30.995
Idjits.

01:33.833 --> 01:35.357
Bobby?

01:40.673 --> 01:42.607
Yup. Order up.

01:48.982 --> 01:51.280
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:51.884 --> 01:54.216
You've been here a couple nights
in a row now.

01:54.387 --> 01:58.255
- What can I say? I like the ambiance.
- Heh.

01:58.424 --> 01:59.550
Get you anything else?

01:59.726 --> 02:02.092
No, thanks.

02:03.129 --> 02:05.757
Thanks. Keep safe out there.

02:06.633 --> 02:08.726
- Really? Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

02:11.137 --> 02:13.037
- Yeah.
- Well, that's fine.

02:13.206 --> 02:15.766
Let's see if we can take care of that.

02:38.531 --> 02:40.658
Hey there, you lost?

02:42.435 --> 02:44.096
What?

02:45.938 --> 02:47.337
- Excuse me, l...
- Heh, whoa.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.440
You look a little Cabo Wabo there.

02:50.043 --> 02:51.670
No. No, I'm fine.

02:51.844 --> 02:55.245
No, you're not. I slipped
a little special sauce into your coffee...

02:55.415 --> 02:57.508
...while you were watching the skirt.

02:57.684 --> 03:00.346
You do know we're venomous, right?

03:01.421 --> 03:03.514
Looks like I didn't dose you
hard enough.

03:03.690 --> 03:06.352
That's okay.
There's more where that came from.

03:13.766 --> 03:16.166
That's for the crappy tip.

05:03.876 --> 05:05.707
Dean, you know, um...

05:07.580 --> 05:09.275
...I wonder if we...

05:10.383 --> 05:13.375
I mean, should we be telling people?
I mean, people he knew?

05:13.553 --> 05:15.612
How long ago did I give Frank
these numbers?

05:15.788 --> 05:17.881
It's been a few weeks, right?

05:18.424 --> 05:21.120
What, is he nuts
or is he just being rude?

05:21.294 --> 05:23.159
Probably both.

05:23.329 --> 05:25.957
Dean, I asked you a question.

05:26.132 --> 05:29.124
Unless something happened to him.
He can't get to the phone...

05:29.302 --> 05:32.271
...because a Leviathan ate his face.
Also a possibility.

05:32.438 --> 05:34.167
- We should go check on him.
- Dean.

05:34.340 --> 05:37.002
Do you wanna call Bobby's people
or not?

05:37.210 --> 05:40.611
- Why is that our job?
- Because who else is gonna do it?

05:41.914 --> 05:44.576
I'm not calling anybody.
If you want to, go right ahead.

05:44.750 --> 05:47.514
I don't wanna call anybody.
You kidding me?

05:52.124 --> 05:54.092
Well, I'm not getting it.

06:01.334 --> 06:02.358
Hello?

06:02.535 --> 06:04.594
<i>Is Bobby Singer there?</i>

06:05.738 --> 06:07.865
Uh, no. He's, uh...

06:08.641 --> 06:11.201
Uh, he's not, but I'm a friend of his.

06:11.377 --> 06:13.845
<i>My dad asked me to call
Bobby Singer specifically.</i>

06:14.013 --> 06:16.447
Right. Well, he's not here.

06:16.616 --> 06:17.844
Um, but, look, if you need...

06:23.055 --> 06:24.215
Who was it?

06:24.390 --> 06:25.687
Just some kid.

06:25.858 --> 06:27.689
For Bobby?

06:27.960 --> 06:29.052
Girl Scout cookies?

06:29.262 --> 06:31.059
I think maybe...

06:31.564 --> 06:35.000
Maybe a hunter's kid?
I mean, she sounded pretty scared.

06:37.136 --> 06:40.196
I have caller ID. We should go find her.
We can check on her.

06:40.373 --> 06:41.635
What about Frank?

06:42.141 --> 06:44.575
Dean,
I think we should go find this girl first.

06:44.777 --> 06:49.146
Frank's been working on the numbers
that Bobby spent his last breath on.

06:49.315 --> 06:51.681
And you wanna back burner that?

06:56.355 --> 06:58.687
Fine. You go check out Girl Scout.

06:58.858 --> 07:00.325
- I'll find Frank.
- Fine.

07:00.493 --> 07:03.758
Know what? On one condition.
If Frank is just spinning his wheels...

07:03.930 --> 07:06.728
...then you bail out on crazy
and come meet me.

07:08.301 --> 07:09.825
Thanks for drinking my beer.

07:10.336 --> 07:12.861
I didn't touch your beer.
Mine's right there.

07:14.407 --> 07:16.739
You probably drank it
without noticing.

07:18.878 --> 07:20.368
Right.

07:43.336 --> 07:48.467
Hello? Um, we spoke
on the phone earlier?

07:52.411 --> 07:53.935
Hi.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.714
Um, I'm Sam.

07:56.882 --> 07:59.544
You sounded like you needed help,
and I was in the area.

07:59.719 --> 08:01.414
How'd you find me?

08:02.088 --> 08:04.454
Your dad is in Bobby's address book.

08:04.623 --> 08:06.420
So where is he?

08:06.592 --> 08:08.082
Bobby?

08:09.428 --> 08:11.089
He, uh...

08:11.931 --> 08:13.762
He's passed away.

08:16.569 --> 08:17.968
- Look, um...
- Krissy.

08:18.137 --> 08:20.970
Krissy. I get it.
You don't let strangers in.

08:21.140 --> 08:23.301
But if your dad said
you could trust Bobby...

08:23.476 --> 08:25.603
...then you can trust me too.

08:31.784 --> 08:35.583
Just so you know, 911 is on speed dial.
One button.

08:35.755 --> 08:37.245
Yeah, sure. Note taken.

08:44.797 --> 08:48.096
So you're a salesman too?

08:48.267 --> 08:49.825
Yup.

08:50.002 --> 08:52.334
So your dad's on the road right now?

08:53.706 --> 08:55.367
Been gone a while?

08:55.541 --> 08:58.032
- He usually calls every night.
- How long has it been?

08:59.111 --> 09:00.942
Five days.

09:02.782 --> 09:04.272
Just you and him, huh?

09:06.118 --> 09:08.916
Heh, I know how that is.

09:09.555 --> 09:11.045
Look, um...

09:12.458 --> 09:15.825
...sometimes, on the road,
crap happens.

09:15.995 --> 09:17.963
So I'll help you track him down.

09:18.130 --> 09:19.427
- Really?
- Of course.

09:20.032 --> 09:22.193
Did he happen to say
where he was going?

09:22.368 --> 09:24.165
He said he had leads near Dodge City.

09:24.336 --> 09:27.362
And does he have a desk or something
where he keeps his stuff?

09:27.540 --> 09:28.939
Yup.

09:40.152 --> 09:41.813
Do you mind making some coffee?

09:45.057 --> 09:46.547
Thanks.

10:15.054 --> 10:16.749
Krissy. Hey, listen.

10:16.922 --> 10:19.390
So I think I got an idea where to start.

10:19.558 --> 10:21.253
So I'm gonna go. Um...

10:21.494 --> 10:22.756
Can I borrow this?

10:23.863 --> 10:25.296
Yup.

10:26.232 --> 10:28.564
Thanks. Here. Here's a number...

10:28.734 --> 10:32.602
...in case you don't hear from me
in the next couple days. Don't worry.

10:33.105 --> 10:34.970
I promise I'll check in.

10:35.141 --> 10:36.233
Don't say that.

10:36.408 --> 10:38.535
That's what my dad said.

11:11.343 --> 11:12.571
This can't be good.

11:16.982 --> 11:18.973
Well, hi.

11:22.655 --> 11:25.317
Frank, we're amongst friends here.

11:26.859 --> 11:28.827
Okay, acquaintances.

11:29.461 --> 11:33.056
That's just what a Leviathan
would say.

11:39.939 --> 11:42.931
Frank, I'm not a Leviathan.

11:43.108 --> 11:44.803
Oh, sure.

11:44.977 --> 11:47.002
You're not a Leviathan.

11:47.179 --> 11:49.204
Dick Roman is not a Leviathan.

11:49.381 --> 11:52.544
Gwyneth Paltrow is not a Leviathan.

11:52.718 --> 11:54.879
- Yeah?
- Trust me.

11:56.522 --> 11:59.457
Okay, I think you've been doing
a little too much research.

11:59.625 --> 12:01.718
They're anywhere, anyone.

12:01.894 --> 12:06.593
Who's to say this ain't the day they
come for old Frank who knew too much?

12:07.600 --> 12:08.794
They bleed black goo.

12:09.301 --> 12:10.461
Right?

12:10.636 --> 12:12.365
You wanna see what I bleed?

12:13.606 --> 12:14.732
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:16.408 --> 12:18.808
Let's take the guns out of it, okay?

12:18.978 --> 12:20.843
Okay.

12:38.197 --> 12:40.392
See? Red-blooded American.

12:42.534 --> 12:44.866
Unh, now...

12:45.938 --> 12:48.930
...your turn.
Whoa, whoa, look, I'm obviously not...

12:49.141 --> 12:51.075
Fair is fair, douche bag.

13:02.221 --> 13:04.917
Yeah.
I'm glad we could share that together.

13:05.691 --> 13:09.923
Grab your gun, come with me.
For God's sake, don't make any noise.

13:28.247 --> 13:29.908
Why the downsize?

13:30.082 --> 13:31.310
You.

13:31.483 --> 13:33.951
"Hey, Frank, go dig up some dirt
on Richard Roman."

13:34.119 --> 13:36.587
That night,
I was burned off every IP I had.

13:36.755 --> 13:40.191
- Ears on my phone, eyes on my house.
- Dick's got people watching you?

13:40.826 --> 13:42.316
Do I look like I know?

13:42.494 --> 13:45.156
You think it's easy to see this deep
into what's real...

13:45.331 --> 13:47.925
...and also be bipolar
with delusional ideation?

13:48.100 --> 13:50.830
There is no pill for my situation,
sweetie pop.

13:51.003 --> 13:55.599
So, yeah, best guess, the bigmouths
are onto me. Next question.

13:55.774 --> 13:57.639
All right, well,
what's the word on the bigmouths?

13:57.810 --> 14:02.941
Ugh, their tentacles are everywhere. I'm
looking at bankers, military high-ups.

14:03.115 --> 14:05.583
- This why you didn't call back?
- Cut me some slack.

14:05.751 --> 14:09.118
- You called me like four days ago.
- I called four weeks ago, Frank.

14:09.288 --> 14:11.256
What? No.

14:11.423 --> 14:13.254
Really? Days, weeks.

14:13.425 --> 14:14.619
Quit busting my chops.

14:14.793 --> 14:16.852
- What, are you kidding me?
- Cool your heels.

14:17.029 --> 14:18.758
I paid you 15 grand for this.

14:18.931 --> 14:21.229
- Yeah, I get that.
- No, you don't get that.

14:21.800 --> 14:25.964
Dick Roman is every card in my hit deck.
You understand that?

14:26.138 --> 14:28.868
Those numbers, they got something
to do with him, okay?

14:29.041 --> 14:30.941
Bobby died for those numbers.

14:31.110 --> 14:35.513
Look, I'm sorry about Bobby.
I really am.

14:36.181 --> 14:40.618
Heh, you know, this one time,
we were in Fresno, and we got stuck...

14:40.786 --> 14:42.219
No, no, no.

14:42.388 --> 14:45.619
I'm not gonna play this "this one time
with Bobby" crap, all right?

14:45.791 --> 14:49.283
I'm not gonna get all warm and fuzzy
with somebody who barely knew him.

14:49.461 --> 14:52.555
- Trying to make friendly conversation.
- This is not a friendship.

14:52.765 --> 14:56.292
- I'm paying you.
- Hey, you know what you need?

14:56.468 --> 15:00.199
- Little LSD, little shiatsu.
- I'm out of here.

15:00.372 --> 15:03.170
Hey, you wanna know
what those numbers are?

15:03.342 --> 15:06.402
Bupkis.
They're not lottery numbers, license.

15:06.578 --> 15:08.045
I know that, Frank, thank you.

15:08.213 --> 15:12.411
Which leaves us little else to do
but probability generate.

15:14.486 --> 15:16.215
Come again?

15:17.156 --> 15:22.423
You run most reasonable possibilities
for a Levi-related five-digit number...

15:22.594 --> 15:25.757
...written by a dying drunk,
and you come up flat.

15:25.931 --> 15:29.833
Know when you start to wonder?
Hey, maybe I'm missing a number.

15:30.536 --> 15:32.834
- Well, how do you figure?
- Oh, I don't know.

15:33.005 --> 15:35.735
Because Bobby was dying
of brain trauma.

15:35.908 --> 15:38.706
I had a tickle there was a reason
nothing was popping out.

15:38.877 --> 15:42.904
I set up a program to run possibilities
for six numbers, seven, eight.

15:43.081 --> 15:44.275
But good news.

15:44.450 --> 15:46.918
- Good news.
- Never had to go past six.

15:47.085 --> 15:48.575
Because this...

15:49.822 --> 15:53.053
...my little lamb, is coordinates.

16:00.833 --> 16:03.233
Are you sure? To what?

16:03.402 --> 16:06.428
A field in Wisconsin.

16:08.540 --> 16:11.065
No. No, Bobby
didn't give us coordinates...

16:11.243 --> 16:13.404
...to some patch of weeds
in Cheeseville.

16:13.579 --> 16:18.744
No. He gave you coordinates to a parcel
recently purchased by Wellman Inc.

16:18.917 --> 16:20.384
A subsidiary of...

16:23.288 --> 16:24.585
...Richard Roman Enterprises.

16:32.664 --> 16:35.326
- So, what do we do?
- Stay away.

16:35.501 --> 16:38.959
Or if we're stupid...

16:39.571 --> 16:41.596
...we go there and set up surveillance.

16:50.182 --> 16:53.948
Matthew Havlena,
found in a ditch off the interstate.

16:54.119 --> 16:55.177
Cause of death?

16:55.387 --> 16:57.446
Missing 5 pints of blood
can't have helped.

16:57.623 --> 17:01.286
Puncture wounds,
femoral arteries and carotid.

17:01.460 --> 17:04.020
- So, what, some kind of animal attack?
- Or a vampire.

17:06.632 --> 17:09.829
Huh. That usually gets
at least a chuckle.

17:15.173 --> 17:16.196
Find Frank?

17:16.407 --> 17:17.432
<i>Yeah. Those numbers?</i>

17:17.608 --> 17:20.476
<i>Coordinates. Dick bought some land.
We're headed there now.</i>

17:20.646 --> 17:22.876
<i>- You're just gonna drive right up...?
- Relax.</i>

17:23.048 --> 17:24.675
It's a field, not the Death Star.

17:24.849 --> 17:28.183
<i>Dick's at a TED conference.
It's all over the Huffington Post.</i>

17:28.353 --> 17:31.049
Heh, wait, wait, wait.
Since when do you read?

17:31.223 --> 17:33.487
Know your enemy.
What's going on with the girl?

17:33.659 --> 17:37.322
Don't think she knows her dad's in the
life. I got three missing truckers...

17:37.496 --> 17:38.895
...and one blood-free body.

17:39.064 --> 17:41.965
Good times.
All right, well, keep me posted.

17:42.134 --> 17:46.230
Got the equipment arranged. Come
and get your costume on. We can scoot.

17:46.939 --> 17:48.463
Costume?

17:48.640 --> 17:50.301
What?

17:52.477 --> 17:54.206
What is so special about this place?

17:54.379 --> 17:55.403
I love a mystery.

17:55.581 --> 17:58.573
Get up in that cherry picker.
Act like you're fixing something.

17:58.750 --> 18:01.344
- I don't know how to drive that.
- You think I do?

18:01.520 --> 18:04.182
- Why do I gotta be the sap that...?
- This says manager.

18:04.356 --> 18:08.087
That one says technician.
Sometime this month?

18:10.596 --> 18:12.393
Come on.

18:23.408 --> 18:25.501
Okay. Ah...

18:27.879 --> 18:29.506
Moving...

18:44.129 --> 18:45.391
Crap.

18:47.933 --> 18:49.366
Come on down, Tarzan.

18:49.534 --> 18:51.024
- What?
- Get down here.

18:57.209 --> 18:58.301
We need to move.

18:59.044 --> 19:02.445
They got this place wired
up the wazoo.

19:02.748 --> 19:03.806
They're watching us?

19:04.016 --> 19:06.644
Ah, no. They're just watching
Cheech and Ed from Ma Bell.

19:06.818 --> 19:09.150
It's gonna be difficult
to set up surveillance...

19:09.321 --> 19:11.448
...if there's, uh, surveillance
everywhere.

19:11.623 --> 19:15.252
Right.
So we need to tap into theirs instead.

19:19.331 --> 19:20.662
There. Now what?

19:20.832 --> 19:24.131
You look horrific. When was
the last time you really slept a night?

19:24.302 --> 19:27.169
- Let's just work, all right?
- This is it.

19:27.339 --> 19:30.968
We watch the screens.
I can take the first shift.

19:31.143 --> 19:33.737
You're no use if you can't even...

19:34.246 --> 19:36.407
...keep your eyes open.

19:43.255 --> 19:46.520
Dean, hey.
So I think this guy was hunting a Vetala.

19:46.692 --> 19:48.353
Uh, dad took one down
back in the day.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.994
Silver knife to the heart, twist,
they're done.

19:51.163 --> 19:53.131
He says they're maladjusted
loner types.

19:53.298 --> 19:55.789
Like to knock a guy out, drag him home,
feed slow.

19:55.967 --> 20:00.063
So if Krissy's dad got grabbed,
there's a chance he might still be alive.

20:01.106 --> 20:04.473
Be nice to get this girl's dad
back home to her, you know?

20:05.177 --> 20:08.078
All right. I could use your help.
Call me.

20:13.885 --> 20:15.443
Excuse me.

20:16.388 --> 20:18.652
Your manager said
you might be able to help me.

20:18.824 --> 20:20.382
Sure. What can I do for you?

20:22.461 --> 20:23.723
You ever see this man?

20:25.397 --> 20:28.298
Uh, might have served him
the other day.

20:30.869 --> 20:33.895
I think he may have gone to talk
to that girl out there.

20:39.311 --> 20:40.710
Thanks.

20:44.015 --> 20:45.505
Hey.

20:45.817 --> 20:48.012
Can I talk to you for a second, uh...

20:48.520 --> 20:50.044
...Sally?

20:51.890 --> 20:52.982
You ever see this man?

20:54.860 --> 20:57.488
- No. Heh.
- You sure?

21:00.232 --> 21:03.531
It's not safe here. Somewhere private.

21:09.741 --> 21:11.402
Something's happening around here.

21:11.576 --> 21:13.134
I'm afraid I'll be next.

21:13.712 --> 21:14.770
Tell me what you saw.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.713
I don't know what I saw.

21:23.054 --> 21:25.022
Sally, run!

21:53.552 --> 21:57.386
- How long was I out?
- About 36 hours.

21:57.556 --> 21:59.114
What?

21:59.324 --> 22:01.884
- Why didn't you wake me?
- Not your butler.

22:02.561 --> 22:03.619
Come see this.

22:08.767 --> 22:10.735
- What?
- This is where it gets good.

22:12.904 --> 22:15.896
- Frank, you need to get out more.
- Not that.

22:20.745 --> 22:22.076
Check out Sarah Palin.

22:23.114 --> 22:25.412
- Who is she?
- Amanda Willer.

22:25.584 --> 22:27.609
Surprise, surprise.

22:27.786 --> 22:29.583
Works for Richard Roman.

22:30.355 --> 22:33.483
- What's she doing?
- Being a naughty, bossy little girl.

22:34.492 --> 22:36.687
I hate to ask for that
in a non-porno version.

22:36.862 --> 22:39.353
Surveying. They're getting ready
to build something.

22:39.531 --> 22:41.021
- Build what?
- Exactly.

22:41.233 --> 22:42.325
What?

22:42.500 --> 22:44.695
- No idea.
- Well, how do we find out?

22:44.870 --> 22:46.337
We watch.

22:46.504 --> 22:48.165
Patience, grasshopper.

22:48.740 --> 22:50.708
Patience and me aren't exactly
on terms.

22:50.876 --> 22:52.275
Go out and kill something...

22:52.444 --> 22:55.311
...or whatever you kids do
to blow off steam.

22:55.480 --> 22:58.608
- Don't like my suggestion?
- I don't think you're in a position...

22:58.783 --> 23:02.480
...to be giving suggestions. You're one
tinfoil hat away from a rubber room.

23:02.654 --> 23:05.214
- Did I mention you look awful?
- Yes.

23:05.390 --> 23:08.518
Maybe because somebody I cared about
just got shot in the head...

23:08.693 --> 23:12.220
...and this is like shoving a rock
up a hill.

23:12.397 --> 23:13.887
And screw you.

23:14.065 --> 23:15.965
Here's my advice you didn't ask for.

23:16.134 --> 23:17.192
- Quit.
- What?

23:17.369 --> 23:18.893
You wanna keep going?

23:19.070 --> 23:20.537
I want Dick Roman on a spit.

23:20.705 --> 23:24.539
But you're gonna drive yourself
into the ground first. Good plan.

23:28.079 --> 23:29.876
I'm not gonna quit.

23:30.048 --> 23:31.208
It's not even an option.

23:31.383 --> 23:35.080
- Not gonna walk out on my brother.
- Okay, then. Fine.

23:35.287 --> 23:36.311
Do what I did.

23:36.488 --> 23:39.389
Heh, what? Go native?
Stock up on C rations? Yeah.

23:39.557 --> 23:41.047
No, cupcake.

23:41.793 --> 23:43.192
What I did when I was 26...

23:43.361 --> 23:47.661
...and came home to find my wife
and two kids gutted on the floor.

23:49.501 --> 23:51.662
Decide to be fine
till the end of the week.

23:52.737 --> 23:58.198
Make yourself smile
because you're alive and that's your job.

23:58.543 --> 24:00.238
Then do it again the next week.

24:03.381 --> 24:06.839
- So fake it?
- I call it being professional.

24:07.085 --> 24:10.919
Do it right, with a smile...

24:11.189 --> 24:13.054
...or don't do it.

24:24.936 --> 24:28.463
<i>Dean, hey.
So I think this guy was hunting a Vetala.</i>

24:28.640 --> 24:30.608
<i>Dad took one down back in the day...</i>

24:30.775 --> 24:33.107
No, no, no, Sam. That's not right.

24:33.278 --> 24:35.041
<i>- What's the guff?
- They're loner types.</i>

24:36.448 --> 24:38.575
<i>Like to knock a guy out, drag him home,
feed slow.</i>

24:38.750 --> 24:39.842
Sam?

24:40.352 --> 24:41.444
No.

24:41.619 --> 24:43.416
<i>- Who's this?
- Who's this?</i>

24:45.423 --> 24:48.950
Sam told me to call
if I didn't hear anything back from him.

25:07.812 --> 25:10.508
That ringing in your ears...

25:11.016 --> 25:13.075
...it's from the venom.

25:13.818 --> 25:15.683
- Venom?
- Yeah.

25:15.887 --> 25:18.378
They hit you
with some kind of knockout juice.

25:19.958 --> 25:21.983
You seem to be handling this
very well.

25:22.527 --> 25:27.089
Yeah, well, um,
I was out there looking for you.

25:27.499 --> 25:29.262
Lee Chambers?

25:29.934 --> 25:31.925
I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's.

25:32.103 --> 25:34.537
Krissy called. She's fine. She is.

25:34.706 --> 25:37.766
She's just worried about you.

25:38.443 --> 25:40.968
Unh, so how do we get out of here?

25:41.646 --> 25:43.614
I don't know.

25:44.015 --> 25:45.676
They'll be back pretty quick here.

25:46.484 --> 25:49.112
- What, just the two of them?
- Yeah. They're a tag team.

25:49.287 --> 25:52.723
One knocks you out, the other dumps
your rig or your ride or whatever...

25:52.924 --> 25:55.290
...miles down the road.

25:55.727 --> 25:58.355
It's a pretty nice system they got.

25:59.464 --> 26:01.489
They've been draining you.

26:01.699 --> 26:03.223
Yeah.

26:03.535 --> 26:05.901
Tap you three, four times,
you're dead.

26:06.071 --> 26:08.005
And let me tell you, heh...

26:08.473 --> 26:10.168
...you can't see...

26:10.341 --> 26:12.536
...you can't walk.

26:14.245 --> 26:16.975
I thought they'd kill me right off...

26:17.449 --> 26:20.543
...but they don't have to.
They got nothing to worry about.

26:20.852 --> 26:23.150
How many times they fed on you?

26:25.957 --> 26:27.857
Three.

26:32.330 --> 26:34.059
Did Sam tell you where he was going?

26:34.232 --> 26:36.894
That's what I'm trying to figure out.
What did you tell him?

26:37.068 --> 26:39.662
- Uh, he checked my dad's room.
- There?

26:39.838 --> 26:41.237
Yeah.

26:54.219 --> 26:56.210
I don't have time
to hold your hand here.

26:56.387 --> 26:58.753
- What are you saying?
- Go wait in the living room.

26:58.923 --> 27:02.290
Your dad may not want you to know
every single thing about him.

27:33.124 --> 27:34.648
Where is it?

27:34.826 --> 27:37.795
You mean everything about the job
my dad was working?

27:37.962 --> 27:41.159
- Sam said you didn't know.
- Sam seemed competent...

27:41.332 --> 27:44.460
...so I figured fine,
I'll do what my dad always tells me to.

27:44.636 --> 27:48.504
Be a regular kid, don't say anything,
stay out of the line of fire.

27:48.673 --> 27:50.641
Let the adults work it out.

27:50.808 --> 27:52.332
So much for that.

27:54.078 --> 27:56.239
All right. Hand it over, okay?

27:56.414 --> 27:58.541
I have had a long, long week.

28:02.921 --> 28:05.287
All right, I get it, you're a tough kid.

28:05.857 --> 28:09.349
But I'm trying to get Sam
and your dad back.

28:09.861 --> 28:13.160
My dad left, and he didn't come back.

28:14.299 --> 28:17.666
Sam left, and he didn't come back.

28:17.835 --> 28:21.771
I give you the info, you leave,
you don't come back.

28:21.940 --> 28:23.840
- I'm coming back.
- I'm coming with you.

28:25.076 --> 28:27.874
- No. No. Hell, no.
- I'm coming.

28:28.947 --> 28:30.505
Or you're not going.

28:33.785 --> 28:34.809
Ow.

28:34.986 --> 28:36.214
Now, hand it over.

28:38.823 --> 28:40.518
I can't.

28:41.159 --> 28:42.626
I burned it.

28:42.794 --> 28:45.786
- You what?
- But lucky for you...

28:45.964 --> 28:48.626
...I memorized it all first.

28:56.741 --> 29:00.336
- Hey, I have a question.
- All right, here's the deal.

29:00.612 --> 29:01.874
I'm a fun guy.

29:02.046 --> 29:04.378
I'm actually awesome. Okay?

29:04.549 --> 29:06.517
But right now, I'm not in the mood.

29:06.684 --> 29:08.345
I'm neck deep in some serious crap.

29:08.519 --> 29:12.250
If this wasn't an emergency, I would
drop your ass off at the nearest mall.

29:12.423 --> 29:14.653
What serious crap?

29:16.394 --> 29:19.227
Revenge crap, all right? Now, shut up.

29:19.397 --> 29:21.695
Eat a cookie or something.

29:30.908 --> 29:34.173
One thing doesn't make sense.
My dad is a pretty great hunter...

29:34.345 --> 29:38.714
...and your brother is the size of a car,
so how did this thing get them both?

29:43.087 --> 29:44.679
Vetalas usually hunt in pairs.

29:46.057 --> 29:50.517
Sam and your dad both assumed
it was one thing hunting solo.

29:50.695 --> 29:52.424
Why did they think that?

29:52.597 --> 29:54.155
Because they had the wrong info.

29:54.866 --> 29:56.595
Or best available.

29:56.768 --> 29:59.965
Our dad took down a loner, years ago.
Sam has his journal.

30:00.171 --> 30:02.662
Your dad must have been going
on the same facts.

30:03.174 --> 30:05.699
And you know different because?

30:07.578 --> 30:11.070
Because I hunted one that turned out
to be two, couple years back.

30:11.249 --> 30:12.944
And you never told Sam?

30:13.117 --> 30:14.209
Wow, thanks.

30:14.385 --> 30:18.082
How about sharing that with the rest
of the class so we don't all get killed?

30:18.323 --> 30:20.689
Sam was away at Stanford,
smart-ass.

30:22.627 --> 30:26.256
Sam went to college?
Thought you said your dad was a hunter.

30:26.431 --> 30:28.331
He was. We were.

30:28.499 --> 30:31.195
Sam quit, went to college.

30:39.711 --> 30:41.702
You could too, you know?

30:41.913 --> 30:43.744
Go to college.

30:44.415 --> 30:47.213
Be a hunter-slash-pediatrician.

30:55.927 --> 30:58.191
Hunter day at the all-you-can-eat.

30:58.363 --> 31:00.923
How's everyone feeling? Good?

31:01.966 --> 31:04.662
Strong silent. Fine.

31:04.836 --> 31:07.828
I don't need much entertainment
with my meal.

31:15.813 --> 31:20.273
Hey, Sally, uh, did I tell you
about the Vetalas I took down in Utah?

31:20.985 --> 31:22.316
Yeah.

31:22.487 --> 31:23.852
You remind me of them.

31:24.021 --> 31:27.047
Except they were so much younger.

31:29.994 --> 31:31.859
I tied them up.

31:32.397 --> 31:34.388
Not because I had to.

31:34.565 --> 31:38.365
More so I could take my time.

31:39.337 --> 31:40.804
- You're lying.
- No.

31:41.539 --> 31:44.531
I want you to know how much I enjoyed
cutting up your sisters.

31:44.709 --> 31:45.801
Shut up.

31:59.323 --> 32:01.188
You ever actually work with your dad?

32:01.359 --> 32:03.850
Sure. Of course.

32:04.028 --> 32:07.725
No, I mean work
and not shoot cans in the woods.

32:07.899 --> 32:09.594
I mean, I help all the time.

32:11.869 --> 32:13.427
So no.

32:15.306 --> 32:19.072
Well, right about now, your stomach
should be pretty knotted up.

32:19.243 --> 32:20.710
Not really.

32:20.878 --> 32:24.609
Look, maybe this was a lot harder
for you when you were my age.

32:24.949 --> 32:27.076
Oh, you think you're a good actress.

32:27.251 --> 32:28.343
You're not.

32:28.519 --> 32:32.011
- What are you talking about?
- Well, hate to break it to you.

32:32.190 --> 32:34.055
It's all over your face. You're scared.

32:34.225 --> 32:39.686
Quit treating me like I'm some girl.
I've been prepping for this my entire life.

32:42.033 --> 32:43.398
Training's one thing.

32:43.935 --> 32:45.835
Doing? A whole another beast.

32:46.337 --> 32:50.068
Wow, you've really scared me straight.
Thanks, Dean.

32:58.616 --> 33:01.050
Why is that waitress
getting into that truck?

33:01.219 --> 33:02.948
I'm not explaining the R-rated crap.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.111
The front of the truck.
Not the back, Dean.

33:15.266 --> 33:17.257
All right.

33:20.004 --> 33:21.733
What century is this?

33:21.906 --> 33:24.670
- No one fist bumps anymore.
- Come on, give it up.

33:24.876 --> 33:26.571
Good work.

33:27.311 --> 33:29.370
You're a dweeb.

33:31.415 --> 33:32.939
- What the hell?
- I got an idea.

33:33.117 --> 33:34.607
How about you stay here?

33:35.520 --> 33:37.579
- Oh, you jackass.
- Well, I'm the jackass...

33:37.755 --> 33:40.155
...who ain't bringing a kid in there.
Why?

33:40.324 --> 33:44.658
- I can do everything you can do.
- I'll bring them back, trust me.

33:44.829 --> 33:46.387
Please. They're probably dead.

33:48.933 --> 33:51.925
- You don't know that.
- It's been days.

33:52.103 --> 33:53.968
They're just a pile of meat.

33:54.138 --> 33:55.469
I've seen it.

33:56.173 --> 33:58.641
People die, Dean.

33:59.110 --> 34:01.977
I watched my mom get torn to shreds.

34:04.549 --> 34:07.143
Let me go in there and kill them.

34:12.790 --> 34:14.155
No.

34:14.324 --> 34:16.315
- Sorry.
- You're such a hypocrite.

34:16.494 --> 34:19.657
- How come you get to do it and I don't?
- Because I'm the grown-up.

34:23.734 --> 34:24.860
Give it to me.

34:25.969 --> 34:28.563
- What?
- Your lock pick.

34:29.940 --> 34:31.306
I will frisk you.

34:35.246 --> 34:36.975
Thank you.

35:01.672 --> 35:04.835
Good thing we picked up a
new one. This one is about tapped out.

35:05.910 --> 35:09.038
- You wanna finish him together?
- Sure. Love to.

35:12.717 --> 35:14.184
Not so fast.

35:27.231 --> 35:28.425
Dad, hold on, I got you.

35:29.433 --> 35:30.923
No!

35:35.306 --> 35:37.297
Let her go.

35:37.508 --> 35:39.942
Or Little Miss Sunshine here gets it.

36:01.766 --> 36:04.963
What were you thinking
bringing her here?

36:08.439 --> 36:10.066
Now drop the knife.

36:15.680 --> 36:18.979
She's just a child. Let her go.

36:19.150 --> 36:22.176
Yeah, I don't think
we'll be letting anyone go.

36:26.057 --> 36:28.048
- Daddy.
- It's okay, baby.

36:28.659 --> 36:31.093
Everything's gonna be fine.

36:31.262 --> 36:33.753
All right,
enough with the family bonding.

36:33.931 --> 36:35.922
- It's time for you to shut up.
- Unh!

36:36.100 --> 36:37.294
Daddy, no!

36:37.468 --> 36:38.935
Dean.

36:39.103 --> 36:41.094
He can't help you. No one can.

36:49.580 --> 36:51.309
Guess I'll have to help myself, then.

37:12.870 --> 37:14.167
Bad actress, huh?

37:15.339 --> 37:17.239
Yeah, I take it back.

37:26.517 --> 37:28.417
Yeah, I was hoping you'd stop by.

37:28.919 --> 37:30.978
I wanted to thank you.

37:31.155 --> 37:33.749
- It's no problem.
- Well, you saved my life.

37:33.924 --> 37:35.016
Krissy's too.

37:36.160 --> 37:39.755
Actually, uh, heh,
she kind of saved ours.

37:40.364 --> 37:42.696
Don't thank us. Quit.

37:44.502 --> 37:46.436
Your daughter is 14 years old.

37:46.637 --> 37:49.003
She's already a hunter
with a kill under her belt.

37:49.173 --> 37:51.164
I'm not trying to be a dick...

37:51.342 --> 37:53.936
...but what do you think that does
to her life span?

37:54.945 --> 37:57.379
She could still be a regular kid.

37:57.782 --> 38:00.216
- You know, I got into this for a reason.
- I know.

38:00.384 --> 38:03.717
Your family. That's the same reason
you should get out now.

38:03.888 --> 38:05.788
I can't.

38:08.592 --> 38:11.220
You ever know anyone
who left the life?

38:15.366 --> 38:16.731
No.

38:16.901 --> 38:18.368
They all get killed first.

38:27.211 --> 38:30.476
Well, uh, we should probably
let you get some rest.

38:31.715 --> 38:33.182
Yeah.

38:43.561 --> 38:44.619
Dean.

38:45.796 --> 38:48.128
Thanks for saying bye, asshat.

38:48.299 --> 38:50.665
- Oh, what, now you're sentimental?
- No.

38:50.835 --> 38:54.931
Just wanted to tell you that
you're kind of amusing for an old man.

38:56.574 --> 38:58.599
How did you get out of them cuffs,
anyway?

38:58.776 --> 39:01.336
A girl's gotta have her secrets.

39:02.780 --> 39:04.441
Bobby pin.

39:04.615 --> 39:07.175
- Could've gotten yourself killed.
- I saved your bacon.

39:07.351 --> 39:08.648
My point stands.

39:10.321 --> 39:11.652
But yes.

39:13.991 --> 39:16.425
So guess I'm retiring.

39:16.594 --> 39:18.528
- One and done.
- Really?

39:18.729 --> 39:21.027
- Mm-hm.
- How you feel about that?

39:22.433 --> 39:26.767
Who knows?
Maybe I'll go to Stanford like Sam.

39:31.508 --> 39:34.033
- We're so lame.
- Yeah, we are.

39:34.245 --> 39:36.145
Take care of yourself.

39:49.293 --> 39:51.887
You know what? Good for them.

39:53.163 --> 39:54.255
Yeah.

39:54.965 --> 39:58.332
It's nice to walk away from someone
and feel like they could be okay.

39:58.502 --> 40:01.130
How about you? How you doing?
You all right?

40:03.574 --> 40:06.566
No. I'm definitely not.

40:06.777 --> 40:13.774
But, uh, you know, I mean, um,
I think maybe I just wanna work. Heh.

40:18.055 --> 40:20.046
Should I even ask?

40:20.557 --> 40:23.526
- I'm fine.
- Fine, meaning?

40:25.195 --> 40:29.495
You're right.
We should just work, right?

40:31.669 --> 40:34.797
Figure out a way
to kick Dick Roman's ass.

40:35.406 --> 40:38.204
But, hey, we are the professionals.

40:55.426 --> 41:00.921
<i>Dear Mr. Fantasy, play us a tune</i>

41:01.098 --> 41:06.536
<i>Something to make us all happy</i>

41:07.204 --> 41:12.232
<i>Do anything
Take us out of this gloom</i>

41:12.409 --> 41:18.644
<i>Sing a song, play guitar
Make it snappy</i>
