01:15.648 --> 01:16.614
We're here.

01:16.650 --> 01:19.517
We are here.

01:20.620 --> 01:21.679
I can't believe we at Three-Tizzle.

01:22.789 --> 01:25.280
The hottest shop in La Lizzle.

01:25.391 --> 01:27.291
English, son.
Remember, we're in America.

01:30.496 --> 01:33.954
- Son, your Uncle Mack is gonna trip.
- Phew! Oh!

01:34.066 --> 01:36.159
Man, when I first left Caruthersville...

01:36.269 --> 01:38.794
- all I had was a $50 Grimley and a Jheri curl.
- Oh!

01:38.938 --> 01:42.203
- Look at me now. Pushin' a fully loaded...
- Oh!

01:42.308 --> 01:44.242
Brand-new Lincoln Navigator.

01:44.343 --> 01:46.243
Come on, Dad.
Compared to these trucks...

01:46.345 --> 01:48.711
- yours is wack.
- What?

01:48.815 --> 01:51.682
- I'm just sayin'. Don't get all mad at me.
- Come on.

01:51.784 --> 01:53.752
I mean, these are
nice cars out here.

01:53.853 --> 01:57.789
You got your Ferrari, your Lotus,
but it's no Lincoln. That's what I'm saying.

01:57.890 --> 01:59.824
Hello, man.
Welcome to 310 Motoring.

01:59.926 --> 02:03.293
- How may I help ya?
- I'm NateJohnson. Is my truck ready?

02:03.396 --> 02:05.956
Oh, Nate. Yes, it is, man.

02:06.065 --> 02:08.966
You're the insurance guy.
I remember your truck.

02:11.002 --> 02:13.665
Oh, snap! Hey.
Yo, that's Kurupt.

02:13.806 --> 02:16.468
I sent him my demo tape,
like, two weeks ago.

02:16.609 --> 02:19.169
Just act like you're my bodyguard.
Look.

02:19.312 --> 02:21.212
- Hey, and if he come over...
- What?

02:21.314 --> 02:24.044
Just call me M.C. "D" to theJizz-A.

02:24.150 --> 02:26.778
- Yeah, Dad.
- Call you who to the Wizz-A?

02:26.886 --> 02:28.945
I named you Divernius James...

02:29.055 --> 02:30.955
After your granddaddy.

02:31.057 --> 02:33.048
Plus that street name stuff
isn't marketable.

02:33.159 --> 02:35.525
This rap thing, son,
there's no future in it.

02:35.628 --> 02:37.619
There's no pension,
no 401 plan...

02:37.730 --> 02:39.664
and obviously no dental.

02:39.765 --> 02:41.733
That's why they all have
those gold teeth.

02:44.504 --> 02:47.064
Oh!

02:47.206 --> 02:49.800
Dad, come on.
Dad, come on.!

02:51.477 --> 02:55.345
That's what I call a fully loaded 'Gator
for the haters.

02:55.448 --> 02:57.780
The platinum grille,
Burberry interior.

03:00.019 --> 03:03.853
Hydraulic switches, three-wheel motion,
and look at the wheels.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.759
Oh, boy.

03:08.861 --> 03:11.989
Son, all that Crenshaw crap
kills the resale.

03:12.098 --> 03:15.295
Now, what self-respecting lawyer or doctor
would drive this thing now?

03:16.769 --> 03:19.738
- Dr. Dre.
- Boy, he ain't no real doctor.

03:19.839 --> 03:21.739
Come here now.
Look, son.

03:21.841 --> 03:23.741
My car will be your car in...

03:23.843 --> 03:25.743
three, four or five, six...

03:25.845 --> 03:27.779
seven, eight, nine, 1 0 years...

03:27.880 --> 03:30.678
and I don't want you thuggin' it up.

03:30.783 --> 03:33.411
But, Dad, then why are we here?

03:35.454 --> 03:37.922
We're here to install my Delco
eight-track tape player...

03:38.024 --> 03:40.117
so I can listen to my music
on the trip.

03:40.226 --> 03:43.127
Listen, if you wanted
to go old-school...

03:43.229 --> 03:45.356
you should have had them
install your record player.

03:45.464 --> 03:48.433
Boy, you know, those videos
got your head all mixed up.

03:48.534 --> 03:50.729
- Now, back in my day...
- Yeah, right.

03:50.836 --> 03:54.704
You couldn't have just two hit songs
and call yourself having a good record.

03:54.807 --> 03:58.504
No, no, no. The whole album had to be good.
You just put it on, let it play.

03:58.611 --> 04:01.375
Wasn't no skip buttons.
Wasn't like that mess you listen to today.

04:01.480 --> 04:04.847
All that "rub me"
and "lick me" and "suck me. "

04:04.951 --> 04:07.977
Gotta wear a condom just
to listen to some of it.

04:10.990 --> 04:13.652
Oh. Oh. No, no, no, no.

04:13.759 --> 04:16.853
- Tell me this is not my truck.
- It is, insurance man. Beautiful, isn't it?

04:16.963 --> 04:20.922
This truck has everything.
It has TVs in the floors and the headrest...

04:21.033 --> 04:26.938
a Nike air bag, even new 26-inch rims
just approved for public use.

04:27.039 --> 04:31.169
Not by me. The only thing I approved
was an eight-track.

04:31.277 --> 04:34.440
Now, where is it?

04:34.547 --> 04:38.244
Oh, the Delco.
It must have been a mix-up...

04:38.351 --> 04:40.819
uh, made by my brother
who we fired yesterday.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.684
Well, imagine that, Ziggy Marley.

04:43.789 --> 04:46.519
Now, I suggest you get
that junk off my truck right now...

04:46.626 --> 04:49.220
before I flip you upside-down
and mop the floor with ya!

04:49.328 --> 04:52.525
Wait, don't. Shh, shh.
Don't be so violent.

04:52.632 --> 04:56.500
Calm down.
I can't just take it off.

04:56.602 --> 04:58.593
It's... It's gonna take about...

04:59.872 --> 05:02.067
- Three days.
- Uh, no. Three? Three days?

05:02.208 --> 05:04.904
No, no, no, no.
In three days I've gotta be in Missouri...

05:05.011 --> 05:07.673
which means
I'm on the I-10 by 10:00.

05:07.780 --> 05:10.578
But no worries.
Just take it...

05:10.683 --> 05:12.651
and bring it back exactly how it is.

05:12.752 --> 05:14.185
- No charge.
- Whoa.

05:14.286 --> 05:17.915
Better not be no charge to me.
Look, what about my eight-track?

05:18.024 --> 05:20.390
Oh, it has eight-track,
nine-track, 1 0-track.

05:20.493 --> 05:24.554
It's a C.D. Player. Don't worry, boss man.
Your ride will glide.

05:24.664 --> 05:26.325
Yeah!

05:26.432 --> 05:28.332
Dad. Look. Look.

05:31.737 --> 05:33.705
Yeah!

05:35.775 --> 05:37.640
Up, up. Down.

05:37.743 --> 05:40.337
Yeah!

05:43.182 --> 05:46.083
Real smooth!

05:46.185 --> 05:47.880
Oh!

05:47.987 --> 05:51.514
This don't make no sense.
D.J., how do you turn this thing off?

05:51.624 --> 05:54.354
Everybody's lookin' at us.
What's up, baby?

05:54.460 --> 05:57.156
Hey, this is hot, huh?

05:59.932 --> 06:01.695
No, no, no.

06:01.801 --> 06:04.235
Yo, Dad, look.

06:04.370 --> 06:08.136
31 0 dropped the navigation in the car.
Look.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.208
It's goin' up, up.

06:10.309 --> 06:12.209
But here's the fun part.

06:12.311 --> 06:14.871
Los Angeles to...

06:14.980 --> 06:17.505
Caruthersville, Missouri.

06:17.616 --> 06:20.050
Los Angeles to Caruthersville.

06:20.152 --> 06:23.280
Distance: 1,888.9 miles.

06:23.389 --> 06:27.223
That's all I need is another woman
telling me what to do.

06:27.393 --> 06:29.861
Ooh, girl, you wanna know
my perfect outfit?

06:29.962 --> 06:33.989
I'm thinking J. Lo's jeans. You know
the ones she had at the MTVAwards.

06:34.100 --> 06:37.934
No, no, no. But Eve's top at the A.M.A.'s,
that was hot. I would rock that.

06:39.238 --> 06:40.933
Open the door.

06:41.073 --> 06:42.973
Tried that.

06:43.075 --> 06:45.270
Here. Use this.

06:45.377 --> 06:48.346
Hold on.

06:49.381 --> 06:52.612
- Hello.
- Nikki, open the door.

06:58.390 --> 07:01.450
Nikki, let your sister
get her dog stuff.

07:03.996 --> 07:06.055
Okay.

07:06.165 --> 07:08.065
Hmm.

07:08.167 --> 07:11.466
Your father was supposed to be here
1 0 minutes ago, so get off the phone...

07:11.604 --> 07:15.131
finish packing
and change that outfit.

07:15.274 --> 07:18.209
Ah! Don't you answer that phone.

07:18.310 --> 07:20.210
Whoever it is can call
when you get back.

07:20.312 --> 07:22.678
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

07:32.792 --> 07:35.727
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

07:35.828 --> 07:38.194
- Dad, did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw that.

07:38.297 --> 07:40.595
Oh, shoot.

07:42.735 --> 07:45.295
Boy, give me the phone.
Phone ain't for you.

07:45.437 --> 07:47.462
Upstairs, D.J.
Hello.

07:47.606 --> 07:50.040
Hey, Mama. No.

07:50.142 --> 07:53.168
- I told you. We'll be there in three days.
- I'm surprised.

07:53.312 --> 07:55.974
'Cause Miss Uppity
makes you back out every year.

07:56.081 --> 07:58.481
I don't know why
that woman doesn't like me.

07:58.584 --> 08:02.384
Come on, Mama.
You did throw cooked rice at our weddin'.

08:03.522 --> 08:05.490
Is that woman even coming?

08:05.591 --> 08:09.493
Yeah. She is, uh,
packing right now.

08:09.595 --> 08:11.495
Hold on, son.

08:11.597 --> 08:14.498
Your brother Mack just got here
with one of those flat-screen TVs.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.569
- Hey, Mama.
- You're always thinkin' about your mama.

08:17.703 --> 08:21.139
- All the time, girl.
- Set it right there between J.F.K. And Jesus.

08:21.273 --> 08:24.140
Hello.
Mack got you a plasma TV?

08:24.243 --> 08:27.770
I don't know. Is that what you call it?
Here. Talk to your brother.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.338
All right. Hey, little bro.
What's goin' on?

08:31.450 --> 08:35.284
Hey, man. What happened
to the 3 5-inch I just sent Mama?

08:35.386 --> 08:39.221
Ah, don't worry about it.
She, uh... She usin' it.

08:39.325 --> 08:41.350
You ain't plannin'
on comin' down here...

08:41.460 --> 08:43.860
and winning my Family of the Year trophy,
are you?

08:43.962 --> 08:45.988
Man, what trophy?

08:46.098 --> 08:48.032
Don't know anything
about no trophy.

08:48.133 --> 08:51.796
I'm just trying to bring my fam down there
so we can see Mama. That's it.

08:51.937 --> 08:54.770
Well, well, that's real
thoughtful of you, baby bro...

08:54.874 --> 08:57.274
seein' as how you ain't
been here in four years.

08:57.376 --> 08:59.970
What you tryin' to say, Mack?
Tryin' to start somethin'?

09:00.079 --> 09:02.343
No, no, no.
I ain't tryin' to start nothin'.

09:02.448 --> 09:04.609
It's just that you ain't
been here in so long...

09:04.717 --> 09:07.584
kind of make me think
you're tryin' to hide somethin'.

09:07.686 --> 09:09.586
You do remember the rules,
don't you?

09:09.688 --> 09:12.953
- You can't win Family of the Year
if you ain't a family.

09:13.058 --> 09:16.255
- I know.
- So, I strongly suggest...

09:16.362 --> 09:18.523
if you want to win yourself
a trophy or somethin'...

09:18.631 --> 09:21.429
you ought to start coaching yourself
a Little League team.

09:23.702 --> 09:25.693
My little brother Nate.
Uh-huh.

09:25.838 --> 09:27.772
Hey, Mama.

09:27.873 --> 09:30.774
Hey, look.
I know he didn't hang up.

09:30.876 --> 09:33.174
Hello? All right.
All right.

09:39.051 --> 09:41.178
Yo, Dad.

09:41.287 --> 09:44.415
Look, um, I'm really tired,
going back and forth.

09:44.523 --> 09:48.687
I mean, we gotta go
all the way over there...

09:48.794 --> 09:50.785
and then we gotta go
all the way over here.

09:50.896 --> 09:54.354
- And then we gotta go all the way...
- All right. I get it.

09:54.466 --> 09:57.663
Look, things are gonna be okay.

09:57.770 --> 10:00.739
If they weren't, we wouldn't be
goin' on this trip together.

10:00.839 --> 10:03.808
Your mother and I
are gonna work things out.

10:03.943 --> 10:06.537
- Don't worry. Okay?
- All right. Cool.

10:06.645 --> 10:08.943
All right, buckle up.

10:09.048 --> 10:12.074
Lock your door.
Close your vent.

10:12.184 --> 10:14.243
- Yeah, Dad. All right.
- Don't touch the radio.

10:14.353 --> 10:17.481
- I said don't touch the radio.
- My bad.

10:22.795 --> 10:27.198
Dorothy, Nikki, let's go!

10:29.735 --> 10:32.568
Son, you wanna learn how to drive?

10:32.705 --> 10:35.333
- For sure. Let's go.
- Give me your hand. Here's your first lesson.

10:35.474 --> 10:38.705
Let's go!

10:38.811 --> 10:41.837
Calm down, Nate. We'll be out in a minute.

10:41.947 --> 10:43.915
Let's go.

10:45.751 --> 10:47.912
Oh, no.
Don't even think about it.

10:48.020 --> 10:50.488
Dang, Dad.

10:50.589 --> 10:55.390
Man, what would I do
without my Mike Tyson grill?

10:55.494 --> 10:58.725
"Tastes so good, it'll bite you back. "

10:58.831 --> 11:01.026
- Let me go get these women.
- Yeah, do that.

11:07.039 --> 11:11.476
Ladies, come on. Let's go.
We gotta be on the I-10 by 10:00.

11:11.577 --> 11:14.068
And it's 9:42. Let's roll.

11:16.048 --> 11:18.642
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:18.751 --> 11:21.777
Don't tell me you are bringing
your schoolwork on this trip.

11:21.887 --> 11:24.151
Yes. I have a test
when I get back.

11:24.256 --> 11:28.056
- Why don't you study when we get back?
- Help me with the bags, please.

11:29.395 --> 11:32.592
D.J., help your mother
with her bags.

11:32.698 --> 11:34.996
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

11:35.100 --> 11:37.000
You're runnin' like
you stole something. Say hello.

11:37.102 --> 11:39.832
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hey, Ma.

11:39.972 --> 11:43.135
You mean you gotta do this...

11:43.275 --> 11:45.300
Yeah, you're right.

11:45.444 --> 11:48.971
My belly button is way better
than Beyoncê's.

11:50.315 --> 11:53.216
What? Now, see,
you've gone a little far now.

11:53.318 --> 11:55.411
I ain't puttin'
chocolate syrup in it.

11:55.521 --> 11:57.250
- No.
- Get off that phone and change.

11:57.356 --> 11:59.256
- Thank you.
- That was the quarterback.

11:59.358 --> 12:01.986
You're living under my roof,
play by my rules.

12:02.094 --> 12:04.892
- No boys on the phone.
- You're acting like Dad.

12:04.997 --> 12:07.591
- No boys stopping by all hours. Don't roll your eyes.
- He's a quarterback.

12:07.699 --> 12:10.600
- That's right.
- Cell phone.

12:10.702 --> 12:13.967
I didn't want you to have a cell phone
in the first place. Your father's idea.

12:15.641 --> 12:17.609
Y'all are arguing about
the wrong thing.

12:17.709 --> 12:20.507
Who made the sandwiches for the trip,
and did you go by Food Club...

12:20.612 --> 12:23.308
and get the big thing
of planters Cheez Balls like I like 'em?

12:23.415 --> 12:26.384
Nate, you see what she's wearing?

12:27.486 --> 12:29.477
Actually, both y'all need to change.

12:29.588 --> 12:31.556
You know my mama don't like pink.

12:31.657 --> 12:34.990
Nate. "Cheez Balls. "

12:35.094 --> 12:37.085
Daddy, I made
this outfit myself.

12:37.196 --> 12:39.790
You need to get upstairs
and finish making the rest of it.

12:39.898 --> 12:42.526
- But it took me...
- But nothin'. Nikki, I am your father.

12:42.634 --> 12:45.034
I know what's best for you,
and that's go change.

12:46.371 --> 12:48.464
L-10 by 10:00. Let's go, people.

12:50.943 --> 12:52.968
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, cutie.

12:53.112 --> 12:54.943
- And how are you?
- Good. You?

12:55.047 --> 12:57.481
Ah, you look so nice.
You ready for the trip?

12:57.583 --> 12:59.676
Yep.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.211
Nate, what happened to your car?

13:04.323 --> 13:06.018
It looks like a purse on wheels.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.719
Then you should feel right at home.

13:08.827 --> 13:10.920
- Damn.
- Oh, there you go, son.

13:11.029 --> 13:14.863
You know, if that rapping thing doesn't
work out, you'll make one hell of a bellboy.

13:16.969 --> 13:20.427
Go ahead. All right, sweetie.
Let's get you in the car.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.634
All right. Upsy-goesy.

13:26.478 --> 13:28.446
Okay. Better.

13:30.082 --> 13:32.050
All right.
Remember, baby girl.

13:32.151 --> 13:35.814
I have a very special birthday party
planned for you at Bun World.

13:35.921 --> 13:38.446
Yea!

13:38.557 --> 13:41.082
Wait, Daddy.
Don't leave Sir Barks-A-Lot.

13:41.193 --> 13:43.218
He's going to miss my birthday.

13:43.328 --> 13:45.853
Sweetie, there is no dog, okay?

13:45.964 --> 13:48.432
Nate, get the dog.

13:52.471 --> 13:54.962
There.

13:56.608 --> 13:59.076
- There you go.
- Thanks, Dad.

14:08.787 --> 14:10.755
What the hell?

14:10.856 --> 14:14.087
- Nikki, this better be F. T.D.
- Yoo-hoo.

14:14.193 --> 14:16.388
His rusty tail is old enough
to be your granddaddy.

14:16.495 --> 14:18.622
- Or Mom's big daddy.
- Dorothy.

14:18.730 --> 14:21.699
"Yoo-hoo, Dorothy"?

14:23.835 --> 14:28.329
Nikki. Tsk. You didn't tell me Mama's
been creepin' while Daddy's been sleepin'.

14:28.473 --> 14:30.737
I didn't tell you 'cause you a kid.

14:30.842 --> 14:32.742
Tsk. See, there you go.

14:32.844 --> 14:35.244
I'm NateJohnson.
Mm-hmm.

14:35.347 --> 14:38.248
Yeah. We'll use those flowers
for his funeral.

14:38.350 --> 14:40.944
I reserved our favorite table
at Starbucks.

14:41.053 --> 14:43.317
Oh.
Thanks for the book, Stan.

14:43.422 --> 14:45.686
Uh, I really can't
accept the flowers.

14:45.791 --> 14:48.521
Why not? L... I spent
all week picking them.

14:48.627 --> 14:50.595
Well, we're study partners,
Stan. That's it.

14:50.696 --> 14:55.030
- What do you mean?
- I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

14:55.133 --> 14:57.067
What's up, brah?

14:57.169 --> 15:00.104
Hello, brother.
Stan Turner.

15:00.205 --> 15:02.173
NateJohnson...

15:02.307 --> 15:04.400
husband, 1 6 years.

15:04.543 --> 15:07.341
- Nate, don't start.
- I'm just trying to take my family...

15:07.446 --> 15:09.346
down to the reunion.

15:09.448 --> 15:12.679
You know, uh, some spades,
a couple of family arguments...

15:12.784 --> 15:14.274
- some softball.
- Whoa. Yes.

15:14.386 --> 15:17.150
Whoa. Careful there.
Just a little...

15:17.256 --> 15:19.019
Oh!

15:19.124 --> 15:21.319
What is wrong with you?

15:21.426 --> 15:23.621
Stan, wait.

15:23.729 --> 15:25.321
"Stan, wait"?

15:25.430 --> 15:28.763
I didn't get the memo. When did
we start seeing other people, Dorothy?

15:28.867 --> 15:32.325
Don't test me. You know the only reason
I agreed to go on this trip...

15:32.437 --> 15:34.871
is 'cause it's
Destiny's birthday tomorrow.

15:35.007 --> 15:37.771
Fine. Fine. Fine.

15:37.876 --> 15:40.902
I'm NateJohnson.
Capricorn.

15:41.046 --> 15:43.139
Check my dental records, jack.

15:50.489 --> 15:56.018
So, where did you meet him...
that so-called accounting class?

15:56.128 --> 15:59.154
So that's what this is all about, huh?
Me becoming a C.p. A.

15:59.264 --> 16:02.097
I thought we settled that argument
when I moved out.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.930
Oh, so I'm the bad guy
because I wanted you...

16:05.070 --> 16:07.265
- to raise our kids?
- I can be a wife...

16:07.406 --> 16:10.034
a mother and pursue my career too.

16:10.175 --> 16:13.611
- Hey, my mother did it.
- Right. Yeah.

16:13.712 --> 16:16.875
That's why the last time
I saw your brother, he was your sister.

16:20.819 --> 16:22.548
Mommy, I'm hungry.

16:22.654 --> 16:26.055
Hey, um, Nikki, can you get your sister
some Froot Loops, please?

16:26.158 --> 16:29.150
Shut up.

16:29.261 --> 16:31.024
Destiny, sweetie.

16:31.129 --> 16:34.860
Be very careful
in Daddy's new truck.

16:34.966 --> 16:39.027
Look. Everybody else, this truck
has to go back exactly the way it is.

16:39.171 --> 16:41.833
If you break something,
then I've gotta pay for it.

16:43.775 --> 16:46.903
Oops. Sorry, Dad.

16:47.012 --> 16:50.971
Th-That's okay, sweetie.
Don't worry about it.

16:55.320 --> 17:00.383
All right.
The I-10 by... 10:03.

17:00.492 --> 17:02.392
Damn. We're late.

17:50.575 --> 17:53.066
Yo, Dad. Who was that?

17:53.211 --> 17:57.079
- It's S.O.S., son.
- I wish somebody can come rescue me right now.

17:57.182 --> 18:01.744
Oh, Nate, be fair. Why don't you just
load half of your C.D.'s and half of his?

18:01.853 --> 18:05.414
I'll load half of his C.D.'s
when he pays half of my car note.

18:05.524 --> 18:07.048
Nate.

18:08.326 --> 18:11.489
Fine. But I like
my music nonviolent...

18:11.596 --> 18:13.587
with limited cussin;

18:13.698 --> 18:15.928
So, nobody who's been shot.

18:16.034 --> 18:18.502
Here. Come here.
Give me this.

18:18.637 --> 18:21.731
Okay. Right here.
Tupac Shakur. Shot.

18:23.909 --> 18:25.809
Nate. Nate, what...

18:25.911 --> 18:27.902
Notorious B.I.G. Shot.

18:28.046 --> 18:30.844
- Hey, Dad. What are you doin'? Mom.
- C-Murder.

18:30.949 --> 18:32.974
Wait. Stop.

18:33.084 --> 18:36.781
- Dad, C-Murder wasn't shot. - Yeah, but
with a name like that, he should have been.

18:49.434 --> 18:52.733
- Sam Cooke.
- Wait. What are you doing?

18:52.871 --> 18:54.839
Shot.

18:54.940 --> 18:57.465
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's Sam Cooke.
That's "born by the river. "

18:57.609 --> 18:59.509
You gonna make me
pull this car over.

18:59.611 --> 19:00.873
- Marvin Gaye.
- Hey, hey.

19:00.979 --> 19:03.106
Shot.

19:03.215 --> 19:05.206
That is one of the greatest singers...

19:06.651 --> 19:09.552
- He threw out Marvin Gaye.
- He was shot... by his daddy.

19:09.654 --> 19:12.145
- Twice.
- What are you...

19:13.725 --> 19:16.353
- Al Green.
- Wait a minute now. He wasn't shot.

19:16.461 --> 19:19.123
- That was hot grits.
- That was close enough.

19:19.231 --> 19:21.756
- Shot.
- Boy, that man is a reverend.

19:21.867 --> 19:24.233
That's my pastor.
What is wrong with you?

19:24.336 --> 19:26.395
How am I supposed to
go to church on Sunday?

19:26.538 --> 19:28.733
Daddy, no one's been shot on this one.

19:45.624 --> 19:48.115
Daddy, why aren't you singing?

19:56.801 --> 19:58.530
Hey.

19:58.670 --> 20:01.230
Hey, hey.

20:01.373 --> 20:03.739
Hey, Dad.!

20:03.842 --> 20:05.810
Nate, what are you doin'?

20:05.911 --> 20:08.812
Little shortcut.

20:09.915 --> 20:11.507
Yeah.

20:16.755 --> 20:19.155
Oh!

20:19.791 --> 20:22.123
Hey!

20:26.865 --> 20:29.663
See this fool?
What does he...

20:29.768 --> 20:32.100
Come on.

20:38.777 --> 20:42.213
That's it. I'm gon' have to show this redneck
what a brother looks like with a V-8...

20:42.347 --> 20:44.406
riding 300 horses.

20:46.518 --> 20:48.509
That's right.
That's right, baby.

20:48.620 --> 20:51.487
I got the zoom-zoom
for your boom-boom right there.

20:51.590 --> 20:53.524
Yeah.

20:53.625 --> 20:54.592
Ooh, Daddy.

20:54.693 --> 20:57.662
Look at the cute little baby.

20:59.898 --> 21:02.025
Yeah, sucker. Yeah.

21:02.133 --> 21:04.158
Tenderwipe that!

21:11.343 --> 21:13.311
Yeah.

21:13.445 --> 21:16.744
That's drivin' right there.
You know what I'm sayin'?

21:16.848 --> 21:19.146
That's all right right there.

21:23.521 --> 21:25.421
Hey, Dad.
Dad, get the bags.

21:25.523 --> 21:27.218
Everybody all right?
Get the bags!

21:27.325 --> 21:29.225
Get the Cheez Balls.!

21:30.862 --> 21:33.160
Man, them my church shoes.!
Look out.!

21:34.566 --> 21:37.126
Nate, do something. Oh, my God!

21:37.235 --> 21:38.862
Daddy!

21:40.805 --> 21:42.796
Everybody hold on!

21:51.916 --> 21:55.215
- Guess I showed him, huh?
- You sure did.

21:57.088 --> 21:59.682
My God.

21:59.791 --> 22:02.589
Uh... Ooh.

22:02.694 --> 22:05.754
Ooh. Ooh.

22:05.864 --> 22:09.425
Boy, that was close.
Anybody else want to drive?

22:12.671 --> 22:14.866
You are now entering Arizona...

22:15.006 --> 22:17.531
the Grand Canyon State.

22:17.676 --> 22:20.110
Seventy. Increasing cloudiness...

22:20.211 --> 22:22.736
and humid with a high of 96.

22:22.847 --> 22:27.307
With the winds out of the east
at 1 4 miles per hour, it's currently...

22:27.419 --> 22:30.149
Nate, the kids are tired.
It's been a long day.

22:30.255 --> 22:32.416
Let's just start fresh tomorrow.

22:32.524 --> 22:36.722
Oh, I guess watching me drive
wore you guys out, huh?

22:38.363 --> 22:41.025
We're not scheduled to stop
until Boulder City.

22:41.132 --> 22:43.327
I don't plan on stopping
till we get there.

22:43.435 --> 22:45.835
Oh, that's a shame.

22:45.970 --> 22:48.598
'Cause there's nothing
that I wouldn't do for a...

22:48.740 --> 22:52.232
nice, hot... bath.

23:01.219 --> 23:03.779
Anything?

23:03.888 --> 23:05.856
Anything.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.041
All right.

23:31.149 --> 23:32.639
Dang, Dad.

23:32.751 --> 23:34.912
Here we go.

23:35.019 --> 23:36.953
Okay.

23:38.289 --> 23:40.655
Okay, you guys wait right here.
I'll get the rooms.

23:50.235 --> 23:53.568
- Welcome. And here are your keys.
- Thank you.

23:53.705 --> 23:56.469
You know, I'm planning
a special evening tonight.

23:56.608 --> 24:01.705
Do you have any roses, some champagne,
box of fine chocolates?

24:01.813 --> 24:03.713
- No.
- Oh.

24:03.815 --> 24:05.976
I'll take a couple of those
chocolate Easter bunnies.

24:06.084 --> 24:09.952
Let me get the, uh...
the diet champagne?

24:11.322 --> 24:13.483
And, uh, all the candles
that you have.

24:13.591 --> 24:16.651
- We don't carry candles.
- Okay, well, is that... Yeah.

24:16.761 --> 24:19.662
- Give me a road flare.
- That's for emergency use only.

24:19.764 --> 24:21.493
This is an emergency.

24:24.435 --> 24:26.801
Does your wife...

24:26.938 --> 24:29.566
know what you're up to?

24:29.707 --> 24:31.504
Well, actually, no.
She doesn't.

24:31.609 --> 24:34.976
I'm keeping this
a little bit a secret from her.

24:35.113 --> 24:37.980
Oh, yes. I bet. I bet you are.

24:38.082 --> 24:40.949
- No, no.
- Listen, player.

24:41.052 --> 24:44.215
I don't know what kind of
twisted affair you're having...

24:44.322 --> 24:46.290
but it's not gonna happen
in my hotel.

24:46.391 --> 24:48.689
Oh, no. Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Please.

24:48.793 --> 24:53.730
Look. I have a surprise evening
planned for my lovely wife.

24:53.832 --> 24:57.029
She's right outside
in the car with the kids.

24:57.135 --> 25:00.434
I mean, that's why I got
the two rooms.

25:02.574 --> 25:05.941
That's the sweetest thing
I've heard in years.

25:06.044 --> 25:08.740
Oh.

25:08.847 --> 25:10.974
And take all your goodies.

25:11.082 --> 25:14.745
- Free of charge. On me.
- Gladys, you don't have to do that. Thank you.

25:14.853 --> 25:16.753
Oh, please.

25:16.855 --> 25:19.483
Husbands like you give me hope.

25:19.591 --> 25:22.185
You got a brother?

25:23.294 --> 25:25.228
Uncle?

25:25.330 --> 25:29.357
- How old's your son?
- Glad... Gladys?

25:29.467 --> 25:32.561
- You're cutting off my circulation.
- Oh. Sorry.

25:35.106 --> 25:38.837
Hey.
Your room isn't ready yet...

25:38.943 --> 25:40.968
but I'm gon' check on it.

25:41.112 --> 25:46.311
Meanwhile, why don't you
get the kids settled in...

25:46.417 --> 25:48.885
and I'll see you in a second.

25:57.395 --> 26:00.592
Oh, yeah.

27:15.106 --> 27:17.370
- Swimming trunks, please.
- Oh.

27:24.082 --> 27:26.710
- Charge it to the room. Thank you.
- You got it.

27:27.819 --> 27:30.549
Ooh, yes, he does.
Wow.

27:41.899 --> 27:44.493
- Nate, what are you doing?
- I just, um...

27:44.602 --> 27:49.005
brought you a little something
to help you relax.

27:49.107 --> 27:52.304
That's what I'm talkin' about
right there.

27:52.410 --> 27:55.345
Some bubbles
with the bubbles.

27:55.446 --> 27:58.347
Mmm.

27:58.449 --> 28:00.679
Plus, uh, some chocolates.

28:00.785 --> 28:04.380
Shh, shh.

28:04.489 --> 28:06.684
Gonna get in there with you, girl.

28:06.791 --> 28:09.453
Mm-hmm.

28:11.529 --> 28:14.020
Oh! Oh.

28:16.300 --> 28:18.268
That's all right there.

28:18.369 --> 28:20.667
Good. Aah.

28:20.805 --> 28:23.035
That's a...
Whoo.

28:23.174 --> 28:26.200
What, you in there
cookin' neck bones, girl?

28:26.344 --> 28:28.312
Ee-yah!

28:29.847 --> 28:33.476
Ooh!

28:34.285 --> 28:37.254
Aah! Gee.

28:37.355 --> 28:39.585
Gonna fool around
and make some coffee in here.

28:39.690 --> 28:41.658
All right. That is...

28:41.759 --> 28:43.522
That is... That's warm.

28:43.628 --> 28:45.596
Oh, man.

28:48.633 --> 28:51.033
Yeah. You know, uh...

28:51.135 --> 28:54.104
it's been a long time
since I've been in ourJacuzzi.

28:56.340 --> 28:58.808
I was thinking...

28:58.943 --> 29:01.377
maybe we can do that thing...

29:01.479 --> 29:04.971
we used to do in ourJacuzzi.

29:05.083 --> 29:08.541
Nate, I am not
getting my hair wet.

29:08.653 --> 29:10.621
Besides, we haven't
solved anything.

29:10.721 --> 29:14.452
Well, um, we could
solve one thing right now.

29:15.560 --> 29:19.656
Either here...
or back up at the room.

29:19.764 --> 29:21.664
You know, it's been three months.

29:21.766 --> 29:24.098
Yeah, it's been three months.

29:24.202 --> 29:27.137
That's what I'm sayin'.
It's been three months.

29:27.238 --> 29:28.796
Yeah, three months.

29:28.940 --> 29:32.569
Right.
Ninety days. Right?

29:34.112 --> 29:38.048
How about, uh,
we, uh, go up to the roof?

29:38.149 --> 29:40.049
Oh, yeah?

29:40.151 --> 29:44.451
Or better yet, why don't we,
uh, go out to the truck?

29:44.555 --> 29:48.047
Oh, no, baby. Anywhere but the truck.
I got to turn that back in.

29:48.159 --> 29:50.889
Maybe we can, uh, do...

29:55.566 --> 29:58.194
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

29:58.302 --> 29:59.633
- No.
- Yeah.

29:59.770 --> 30:01.362
- You serious?
- Yeah.

30:01.506 --> 30:03.974
In here? You serious?

30:04.108 --> 30:07.339
We never done that before.
Okay. All right.

30:07.445 --> 30:10.710
Girl, you real... Oh, you're wild.

30:10.815 --> 30:13.409
Going back to your old days.

30:13.518 --> 30:15.179
Hey, hey.

30:15.286 --> 30:18.221
Yeah. All right.
Come on. Your turn.

30:18.322 --> 30:20.381
Um...

30:20.491 --> 30:22.721
you know, I...
I gotta go to the bathroom.

30:22.827 --> 30:24.727
Be right back.

30:24.829 --> 30:26.797
Bathroom.

30:28.166 --> 30:30.532
- Dorothy, you're comin' back, right?
- Uh-huh.

30:30.635 --> 30:32.967
Don'tjust leave me out here
all alone.

30:33.104 --> 30:35.470
Dorothy, come on.
Quit playin'.

30:37.275 --> 30:39.539
- Oh, no.
- Good night, Nate.

30:39.644 --> 30:42.408
Dorothy! All right.

30:42.513 --> 30:45.277
Dorothy, see...
See what you done did.

30:46.951 --> 30:50.114
Come on, Dorothy. Why you...

31:16.714 --> 31:19.114
What the hell?
What's goin' on?

31:21.752 --> 31:24.118
Why y'all all up on me?

31:32.063 --> 31:35.123
Yeah.
Uh-oh.

31:35.233 --> 31:38.566
Uh, ladies,
if y'all see a snake, um...

31:38.669 --> 31:40.762
trust me, he won't bite you.

31:43.741 --> 31:46.574
- Diet champagne.
- Ooh, Easter bunnies.

31:46.677 --> 31:48.008
- My favorite.
- Hey.

31:52.049 --> 31:54.017
What the...

31:57.521 --> 32:00.319
Oh. Nate.

32:03.794 --> 32:05.762
Ohh.

32:12.336 --> 32:14.327
So, Mr. Johnson.

32:15.906 --> 32:19.069
- Which one's your wife?
- Hey, it's not what it looks like.

32:19.176 --> 32:23.112
Well, guess you won't
be needing these.

32:23.214 --> 32:25.205
Oh, no, no.
Come on. I'm gonna need those.

32:25.316 --> 32:27.341
Come on, Gladys.

32:29.453 --> 32:33.116
Well, uh, ladies, um...

32:33.224 --> 32:36.125
I have to go see
a man about a horse.

32:36.227 --> 32:38.320
Gonna get out of here.

32:38.429 --> 32:40.829
- Y'all have a pleasant evening.
- Uh-huh.

32:40.931 --> 32:42.990
Oh, watch it.
Hey. Oh, come on now.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.795
- We won't peek.
- Hey. Oh. Hey!

32:44.902 --> 32:47.427
Hey. Oh!

32:48.939 --> 32:51.430
I saw your...
Watch your hand. Whoa-ho!

32:51.575 --> 32:54.237
- Bull's-eye. Bull's-eye.
- I'm not like that.

32:54.345 --> 32:57.007
That belong to somebody. Come on.

32:57.114 --> 32:59.708
Don't look. I'm shy.
Don't... Y'all. Come on.

32:59.817 --> 33:03.253
Whoo.! Oh.!

33:03.354 --> 33:05.845
Who does your bikini wax?

33:10.361 --> 33:12.295
Hey, girl, how was your treatment?

33:12.396 --> 33:14.956
Oh, it was wonderful.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.968
Go, go.

33:36.654 --> 33:39.714
There'll be plenty of time
for that tomorrow, okay?

33:44.128 --> 33:46.528
Hey. Tom, Judy.

33:46.630 --> 33:49.326
How you guys doin'?
It's a mighty fine evening.

33:49.433 --> 33:51.799
Why don't you get rid of
the kids and the clothes...

33:51.902 --> 33:54.735
- and we're all playing
butt-naked Uno up in 304. - Daddy.!

34:05.416 --> 34:07.941
Nate.

34:08.052 --> 34:09.985
Yes?

34:11.722 --> 34:13.587
You know what you're doing?

34:13.690 --> 34:15.215
Mm-hmm.

34:15.326 --> 34:18.625
- Well, could you stop?
- Nope.

34:18.728 --> 34:20.856
Why are you taking this out on me?

34:20.965 --> 34:22.899
You brought this on yourself.

34:26.704 --> 34:29.605
- Hello.
- Hello, Dorothy.

34:29.706 --> 34:31.971
- Hey, you.
- I miss you. Where are you?

34:32.076 --> 34:35.603
Um, outside of Santa Fe,
New Mexico.

34:35.713 --> 34:37.271
"You"? Who is "you"?

34:37.380 --> 34:40.282
Stan, please. I'm with my family.

34:40.384 --> 34:42.476
Stan.

34:42.585 --> 34:45.077
- Study partner, my...
- Daddy.

34:45.188 --> 34:47.623
What's that big building over there...
right over there?

34:47.725 --> 34:49.625
That's a mall?

34:49.726 --> 34:52.127
It's more than a mall, sweetie.
That's Outlet 800.

34:52.228 --> 34:54.629
It's over 800
top designers' wholesale outlets.

34:54.732 --> 34:56.859
I just read about it
in my travel guide here.

34:56.967 --> 34:59.060
Daddy, can we stop
and check it out?

34:59.203 --> 35:02.730
- Oh, no, sweetie. No, no, no.
- Please?

35:02.873 --> 35:05.706
No can do.
We could, uh, lose a whole afternoon...

35:05.810 --> 35:08.938
- in their state-of-the-art day
spa theyjust built. - Day spa?

35:09.046 --> 35:11.708
But you know what?
I got something better planned for us.

35:11.816 --> 35:14.683
We're gonna stop
at Little Tanawanda Village.

35:14.785 --> 35:17.151
Nikki, you remember?
That was your favorite place.

35:17.254 --> 35:19.814
- No, I don't.
- She was two years old.

35:19.924 --> 35:22.290
And I didn't sign up
for some old Indian village...

35:22.393 --> 35:24.884
or to see
the world's largest ball of yarn.

35:24.995 --> 35:28.487
You said "family reunion. " That means
straight to Caruthersville and straight back.

35:28.599 --> 35:31.124
"The I-10 by 10:00."

35:32.870 --> 35:35.964
Oh, yeah. That's funny.
That's funny, Dorothy.

35:36.106 --> 35:38.870
You know what?
This is important, okay?

35:38.976 --> 35:44.881
Now, I didn't tell you this before,
but I'm one-eighth and 3/1 4ths Cherokee.

35:44.982 --> 35:47.212
All right. That's why I got the baby hair.

35:47.318 --> 35:49.377
- Sometimes I have to shave that.
- Baby hair?

35:49.487 --> 35:52.479
- Where's this baby hair?
- Come on. You know that get me started.

36:06.737 --> 36:09.399
Ah, man.
I'm knocked out.

36:09.540 --> 36:11.440
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

36:11.542 --> 36:14.375
Can you tell me
where's Little Tanawanda?

36:14.478 --> 36:16.173
This is Little Tanawanda.

36:18.816 --> 36:21.410
- Dad, I'm hittin' the arcade.
- Okay, son.

36:21.519 --> 36:23.953
You mean to tell me...

36:24.054 --> 36:27.114
That this is Little Tanawanda?

36:27.224 --> 36:29.988
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right.

36:30.094 --> 36:32.289
My man.

36:32.396 --> 36:37.698
Why don't you just lead me to some...
real, old-school Indians...

36:37.801 --> 36:40.998
that are, uh,
still keepin' it real.

36:42.139 --> 36:44.334
Wait, uh, right here.

36:44.475 --> 36:47.000
I think I know someone
who can show you, uh...

36:47.144 --> 36:51.274
- how to get to where the real Indians live.
- Thank you.

36:53.083 --> 36:55.517
Hey, uh, Navarro,
we got a big spender over here...

36:55.619 --> 36:58.281
who wants to know how to
get to where the real Indians live.

36:58.389 --> 37:00.414
Daddy, can we go now?

37:00.524 --> 37:04.016
Just a second, babe. All right?
I got a little something workin' right here.

37:13.103 --> 37:15.003
Daddy, can we go now?

37:15.105 --> 37:17.903
We're about to get some directions
to a real Indian village.

37:18.008 --> 37:22.809
Daddy, I don't care about
no little Indian village. All I wanna do...

37:22.913 --> 37:27.077
Ahh. Take our time
and get those directions.

37:27.184 --> 37:29.152
How.

37:29.253 --> 37:31.983
- My name's Navarro.
- Uh-huh.

37:32.089 --> 37:34.148
I hear you seek
real Indian village.

37:34.258 --> 37:35.885
I think I can help you...

37:35.993 --> 37:38.223
and your daughter.

37:38.329 --> 37:40.297
We are here.

37:42.299 --> 37:43.926
Way at the top.

37:44.034 --> 37:45.899
If you follow
Running Bear River south...

37:46.003 --> 37:48.733
as the sparrow flies...

37:48.872 --> 37:51.306
then take
Walking Buffalo Road east...

37:51.408 --> 37:53.740
- a half moon to the crossing.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:53.844 --> 37:57.507
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's way too much energy there, Red Bull.

37:57.615 --> 37:59.515
All right? Bring it down.

37:59.617 --> 38:02.916
And then ride bareback
20 horse trots.

38:03.020 --> 38:06.751
I'm in a truck. All right?
A Lincoln Navigator.

38:06.857 --> 38:10.623
Oh. Just take I-53 northeast.

38:10.728 --> 38:12.719
I'm gon' take that service road.

38:12.830 --> 38:14.730
- Beautiful.
- What you say your name was again?

38:14.832 --> 38:16.993
- Navarro.
- Oh, okay. I see.

38:17.101 --> 38:19.296
Okay. Um, in the land
of my ancestors...

38:19.436 --> 38:22.337
some tribes may be, uh,
reluctant to embrace you.

38:22.439 --> 38:25.806
Therefore, I strongly recommend you
wear something that gives you authority.

38:25.909 --> 38:27.843
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:27.945 --> 38:29.936
- I remember wearing one of these.
- Yeah.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.048
That's right. I can make it rain.

38:32.149 --> 38:34.049
How about me
giving you my number?

38:34.151 --> 38:35.618
Hi-how-are-ya! Hi-how-are-ya!

38:35.719 --> 38:37.653
I'm going to lunch.

38:37.755 --> 38:40.280
My number in case you get lost.

38:40.391 --> 38:42.291
- All right.
- Hey, hey, hey.

38:42.393 --> 38:44.588
Back off my daughter, man...

38:44.695 --> 38:47.687
before you end up
being called Little Broken Jaw.

38:47.798 --> 38:51.598
- Daddy, what are you doing?
- Come here. What is your problem, huh?

38:51.702 --> 38:55.331
You know what? I am not a little girl
anymore. Those days are way over.

38:55.472 --> 38:58.407
- I can handle myself.
- You can what?

38:58.509 --> 39:01.967
You gonna get handled, you keep talking...
I don't know who you think...

39:02.112 --> 39:05.445
You've been gone three months, and then
you're gonna try and tell me what to do.

39:05.549 --> 39:07.540
- You live up the street, remember?
- Gi...

39:07.651 --> 39:10.882
You're gonna need some allowance money.
That's what you'll remember.

39:10.988 --> 39:12.649
Get in the car.

39:14.858 --> 39:17.691
And you... I... I'll fight
an Indian. All right?

39:17.795 --> 39:19.820
I dance with wolves, okay?

39:26.503 --> 39:29.165
And as for you, little miss pocahontas...

39:29.306 --> 39:32.707
until we get to the reunion,
your little fast tail is grounded.

39:32.810 --> 39:35.779
- You can't ground me in no car.
- I can't ground you? Oh, really?

39:35.879 --> 39:37.779
How about no more TV?

39:37.881 --> 39:39.974
- So? I ain't watchin' no TV.
- Mm-hmm.

39:40.084 --> 39:41.779
No more computer.

39:43.654 --> 39:45.645
- And no more cell phone.
- Daddy.

39:46.757 --> 39:49.089
See? Just like home.

40:00.704 --> 40:04.105
You are now entering Colorado,
the Centennial State.

40:08.145 --> 40:11.706
Look, Daddy.
That lady needs a ride.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.787
Kids, look. Remember,
if I never taught you anything else...

40:19.890 --> 40:21.790
never pick up strangers.

40:21.892 --> 40:24.793
She could have just as well
been a serial killer.

40:33.670 --> 40:35.570
We are in the middle of nowhere.

40:35.706 --> 40:38.231
Tell me you're not about to
pick up a hitchhiker.

40:38.375 --> 40:40.343
Baby, what would Jesus do?

40:44.114 --> 40:46.105
Thanks for picking me up...

40:46.216 --> 40:48.582
and, um, opening the door.

40:48.685 --> 40:50.880
No one does that no more.

40:50.988 --> 40:52.888
You must be a real man.

40:57.361 --> 41:01.058
Uh... I... I'm NateJohnson,
and, uh, that's Nikki.

41:01.165 --> 41:03.395
- Hi.
- That's DJ.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.730
- Hey. What's up?
- And that's little Destiny.

41:06.937 --> 41:09.337
And, uh, this is Dorothy.

41:09.439 --> 41:11.407
She lives down the street.

41:11.508 --> 41:14.341
- Daddy.
- Well, it's true. She does.

41:14.444 --> 41:17.038
- So, what's your name?
- Chrishelle.

41:17.147 --> 41:19.411
Chrishelle Rene Boudreau.

41:19.516 --> 41:21.882
Boudreau.
You hear that?

41:21.985 --> 41:25.011
- Don't we have some Boudreaus down in Shreveport?
- No.

41:25.122 --> 41:28.182
You know, I thought you had
thatJohnson look.

41:28.292 --> 41:31.455
Well, if you're family, you should
ride down to Caruthersville with us.

41:31.562 --> 41:33.120
It's our family reunion.

41:33.230 --> 41:35.824
DJ., you can't give out
that information to strangers.

41:35.933 --> 41:38.561
Uh, no offense, Chrishelle.

41:38.669 --> 41:40.398
I understand.

41:40.537 --> 41:43.233
There are some crazy people
out there.

41:44.441 --> 41:46.409
- Hey, Nikki.
- Yes?

41:46.510 --> 41:49.445
- Take a picture of me and Chrishelle.
- No, no, no.

41:49.546 --> 41:53.676
Uh, some people say if you're
ever caught on film, you lose your soul.

42:02.526 --> 42:04.756
Are we there yet?
I'm starvin'.

42:04.862 --> 42:08.559
No, Daddy,
I'm about to pass out.

42:08.665 --> 42:12.897
Hold on, everyone.
Heaven is just around the corner.

42:13.036 --> 42:14.628
Bun World. One mile.

42:16.006 --> 42:18.702
I want Chuck E. Cheese.

42:18.842 --> 42:20.833
Boy, what are you doing?

42:20.978 --> 42:24.311
Are your braids too tight?
Put that down. You know we say grace.

42:24.414 --> 42:26.746
And since Chrishelle here
is our guest...

42:26.850 --> 42:29.580
I'd like you to bless the food,
if you don't mind.

42:31.021 --> 42:32.989
Sure. All right.

42:33.090 --> 42:35.888
Close your eyes.
God is great, God is...

42:35.993 --> 42:38.018
Daddy, Sir Barks-A-Lot
ran away.

42:38.128 --> 42:41.222
No, baby. No, he didn't.

42:41.331 --> 42:43.424
Come on. Sweetie.

42:43.533 --> 42:46.525
- Okay. All right.
- I love you, Sir Barks-A-Lot.

42:46.670 --> 42:48.797
Have a seat back down.

42:48.939 --> 42:50.566
Honey, you got me.

42:50.707 --> 42:52.607
- Sorry, Daddy.
- I'll get it.

42:52.709 --> 42:55.610
- No, you won't.
- What?

42:55.712 --> 42:58.840
Uh, look, I'm gonna go to the restroom
and, uh, get this off.

42:58.949 --> 43:00.849
Chrishelle,
finish blessing the food.

43:02.886 --> 43:04.786
Can you cover for me?

43:04.888 --> 43:07.652
- Whoops.
- Excuse me. I'm the one who called about the birthday cake.

43:07.758 --> 43:09.692
They're putting
the finishing touches on it now.

43:09.793 --> 43:12.455
- Uh, where is your bathroom?
- Just past the pool table.

43:15.465 --> 43:17.626
God is great,
God is good.

43:17.734 --> 43:20.794
Let us thank him
for our food.

43:20.938 --> 43:23.498
Friends of the night,
please cover us.

43:23.640 --> 43:27.167
Black as a pit.
Deeper than the depths of the abyss.

43:27.311 --> 43:30.337
I call upon
the power of darkness...

43:30.447 --> 43:34.076
to help me cast this unbreakable spell.

43:34.184 --> 43:36.744
Make us all as one.

43:36.853 --> 43:38.980
Chrishelle, Dorothy...

43:39.089 --> 43:42.752
Nikki, Destiny, Nate
and his son.

43:42.859 --> 43:45.623
Amen.

43:47.664 --> 43:49.996
Okay. All righty.
Here we go.

43:58.442 --> 44:00.342
Oh.!

44:00.444 --> 44:05.074
Hey, buddy, you okay in there? 'Cause it
smell like the circus done came to town.

44:07.951 --> 44:11.546
Damn it.

44:11.655 --> 44:14.249
No toilet paper.

44:14.358 --> 44:16.326
Oh, well.

44:22.132 --> 44:24.396
Ahhh. Ah, my cake spatula.

44:25.802 --> 44:27.702
Almost forgot that.

44:27.838 --> 44:29.863
Hey, buddy. You know how
to spell "Destiny"?

44:30.007 --> 44:32.976
Never mind.
I'll figure it out.

44:33.076 --> 44:35.476
Enjoy your lunch.

44:41.318 --> 44:45.015
I know they say the Navigator is supposed
to seat eight people comfortably...

44:45.122 --> 44:48.114
but I don't think they meant
all in the front seat.

45:13.650 --> 45:17.177
Dorothy, okay, I've got us
a couple of rooms here.

45:17.287 --> 45:19.482
One for the guys,
one for the girls.

45:19.589 --> 45:21.386
- Looks like we're roommates.
- Adjoining rooms.

45:21.491 --> 45:23.186
Uh, Nate, sweetie...

45:23.293 --> 45:28.026
why don't we give our guest
a room for herself?

45:28.131 --> 45:31.191
You know how Destiny loves to
snore the paint off the walls.

45:31.301 --> 45:33.895
And, um, you can sleep
with me and the kids.

45:34.004 --> 45:37.735
Oh, yeah. That's funny. Maybe, uh,
we can just meet in the hot tub again.

45:37.874 --> 45:40.843
Uh, I don't mind sharin'.
Snoring doesn't bother me none.

45:40.977 --> 45:42.877
See? Right there.
Chrishelle doesn't mind.

45:42.979 --> 45:46.745
No, Nate. I insist
you sleep with me.

45:46.850 --> 45:50.809
Okay, all right.
The begging is not becoming of you.

45:51.955 --> 45:54.617
Good night.

45:54.724 --> 45:56.919
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

46:01.264 --> 46:03.323
I'll see you in a minute.

46:03.433 --> 46:05.765
- What is goin' on?
- Slackin' on your pimpin', Dad.

46:06.803 --> 46:09.067
You need to ditch her.

46:09.172 --> 46:12.369
Let me see those toes.
Are they nice and clean? Yeah?

46:12.509 --> 46:14.568
- Yeah, Mom.
- "Yeah, Mom. "

46:22.819 --> 46:25.117
- St... Stop playin'.
- Will you stop?

46:28.859 --> 46:31.123
- Go back.
- Stop hogging the TV.

46:31.228 --> 46:33.492
Well, why don't you go
talk on your cell phone?

46:33.597 --> 46:36.395
Oh. Oh. I forgot.
You grounded.

46:36.500 --> 46:39.230
- I can't stand your ugly butt.
- Capital "G." Oh!

46:39.336 --> 46:41.497
- Why you do that?
- I'm gonna tell Mom and Dad.

46:41.605 --> 46:44.335
- All right. Enough.
- See?

46:44.474 --> 46:47.705
I guess I found the only Chuck E. Cheese
in the whole state.

46:47.844 --> 46:49.937
- Okay. Look.
- I'm the oldest. I'm the oldest.

46:50.080 --> 46:53.049
Settle down. No one eats until
your sister eats. It's her birthday.

46:53.183 --> 46:55.947
- Daddy.
- Okay.

46:56.052 --> 46:58.748
All right.
Here we go.

47:00.023 --> 47:02.457
I hope she enjoys this.

47:02.559 --> 47:05.756
Destiny, Daddy's got
a surprise for you.

47:29.219 --> 47:32.950
- Hit it.

47:33.056 --> 47:36.423
Ah, you got it.

47:54.377 --> 47:57.972
Nate, stop it.
Stay on your side of the bed.

48:01.451 --> 48:03.749
Nate, I'm serious now.

48:05.422 --> 48:07.083
Hey, it's not me.

48:11.895 --> 48:13.920
Stop hogging all the covers.

48:14.030 --> 48:16.191
All right.
All right, all right.

48:42.359 --> 48:44.259
Aaah!

48:44.361 --> 48:46.022
What?

48:47.631 --> 48:50.191
Get out.!
Get out, get out.!

48:50.300 --> 48:51.665
Get up!

48:57.941 --> 49:00.501
I'm gonna do somethin'.
I'm gonna do somethin'.

49:03.580 --> 49:05.411
Use my shoe.

49:05.515 --> 49:07.676
All right, I got it.
I got it.

49:07.784 --> 49:09.513
Yeah, the shoe!
The shoe!

49:15.592 --> 49:17.560
Aaah!

49:19.029 --> 49:21.589
- Daddy.
- Get back.

49:21.698 --> 49:23.928
- Get out there, Dad.
- Hit it hard!

49:24.034 --> 49:26.059
- Get the alligator! Kill him!
- Get him, Dad.

49:26.169 --> 49:29.002
I know what I'm doing.
I got what I'm doing.

49:29.105 --> 49:31.164
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Be careful.

49:31.308 --> 49:33.105
Daddy, you're struggling.

49:33.243 --> 49:35.711
Daddy, you're struggling.
Hey. Hey, Daddy, I'm comin;

49:35.812 --> 49:37.370
- I'm gon' help you right now.
- D.J.

49:37.514 --> 49:39.243
DJ...!

49:39.349 --> 49:41.340
Don't go in there!

49:44.487 --> 49:46.648
Oh! Get him, Dad.

49:46.756 --> 49:48.656
I got him.

49:48.758 --> 49:52.091
Get him, Dad.

49:54.230 --> 49:56.221
Get him, Dad.

49:56.333 --> 49:58.062
Oh!

49:58.168 --> 50:00.136
- Hold up.
- I got him. I got him.

50:00.236 --> 50:03.069
You can't drown no alligator.
They live in water.

50:03.173 --> 50:05.266
- That's they habitat.
- I'm gonna flush him.

50:05.408 --> 50:07.467
That's right, Dad.
Flush him. Flush him.

50:07.610 --> 50:10.170
Twinkie? Twinkie.

50:10.313 --> 50:12.406
- Twinkie?
- It's not bath night.

50:12.549 --> 50:16.144
- What... You know this thing?
- Oh, come to Mom.

50:16.252 --> 50:18.618
Oh, Twinkie wouldn't hurt a fly.

50:18.722 --> 50:20.883
- Let's go.
- No. I know, I know.

50:22.726 --> 50:25.388
Shh. Dorothy, your shoes
makin'too much noise.

50:25.495 --> 50:28.692
- Take those off. D.J., pick up your sister.
- I got her.

50:33.002 --> 50:36.631
You are now entering Kansas,
the Sunflower State.

50:50.286 --> 50:53.050
Yo, Dad, can we pull over?

50:53.156 --> 50:58.116
No, son. We can't stop.
I can already smell my mama's cookin'.

50:58.228 --> 51:01.163
But I really need to go.
It'll only take a sec.

51:01.264 --> 51:04.495
D.J., we just stopped in WaKeeney.

51:04.601 --> 51:07.798
Now, I warned you about drinking
all those pepsis so close together.

51:07.904 --> 51:10.964
You're just gonna have to
learn a lesson.

51:11.074 --> 51:13.065
Think of something dry, like...

51:14.110 --> 51:16.078
Mama's meat loaf.

51:16.179 --> 51:18.943
- Come on, Dad.
- We are not stoppin'.

51:43.173 --> 51:45.141
Oh!

52:09.566 --> 52:11.534
You know, son...

52:11.634 --> 52:14.262
the only reason
I'm hard on you is...

52:14.370 --> 52:17.362
well, because one day you'll
wear the pants in your own family.

52:17.474 --> 52:20.272
People will depend on you.

52:20.410 --> 52:22.435
Now, how can they do that...

52:22.579 --> 52:25.104
if your pants are hanging
all off your behind?

52:25.248 --> 52:28.684
Have you thought about what you're gonna
do if this rap thing doesn't work out?

52:28.785 --> 52:33.017
Well, I was thinking about
law school...

52:33.122 --> 52:35.716
or medical school.

52:35.825 --> 52:38.851
But then Mom said
she'll help me incorporate.

52:38.962 --> 52:41.362
So, I was thinking about...

52:41.464 --> 52:43.955
coming out with my own line
of hip-hop pajamas.

52:44.067 --> 52:47.230
- Pajamas?
- Yeah. You know how puffy has Sean John...

52:47.337 --> 52:49.237
and then Jigga has Rocawear?

52:49.339 --> 52:50.897
- Oh, my goodness.
- Check this out.

52:51.040 --> 52:54.100
D.J.'s p. J.'s.
Baggy always.

52:54.244 --> 52:56.144
Baggy.

52:56.246 --> 52:59.977
I told your mother not to stand by the
microwave when she was pregnant with you.

53:08.625 --> 53:11.526
Wait a minute.
What the hell?

53:11.628 --> 53:13.596
Wait a minute.

53:14.631 --> 53:16.599
Stan?

53:16.699 --> 53:18.599
Stan. Yeah, right.

53:21.538 --> 53:23.335
There you go, Stanley.

53:33.683 --> 53:35.674
Yeah.

53:38.154 --> 53:40.349
Man, where's my...

53:40.456 --> 53:43.289
Ah. Let me get
a little swallow.

53:43.393 --> 53:46.157
No. No, no. No.
Dad, don't drink that.

53:46.930 --> 53:48.830
Nah. Dad.

53:48.932 --> 53:51.264
- Dad. Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa.
- What the...

53:56.606 --> 54:00.440
Uh-oh. I wouldn't have
done that if I were you.

54:02.912 --> 54:05.745
Boy, look, I've been driving
since before you were born, okay?

54:05.848 --> 54:08.316
- But you hit a cop.
- I didn't hit a cop.

54:08.418 --> 54:10.909
Oh, I hit a cop.

54:11.020 --> 54:13.716
- Aaah!
- Dad, we off the road.!

54:13.823 --> 54:15.654
- What?
- Whoa.

54:15.758 --> 54:17.350
- Nate, stop!
- Whoa!

54:18.628 --> 54:20.823
Hey, Dad, what are you doing?

54:20.930 --> 54:23.057
Aaah!

54:24.434 --> 54:25.401
Oh, my...

54:25.501 --> 54:27.833
Oh! No!

54:27.937 --> 54:30.269
No, no, no, no.
Come on, man.

54:30.373 --> 54:33.001
- No. Come on. I gotta take this car back.
- Man.

54:37.280 --> 54:40.408
No. Come on, man.

54:47.290 --> 54:49.588
This'll cost me a fortune.
This is ridiculous.

54:49.692 --> 54:51.887
Oh, now the cops.

54:51.995 --> 54:54.020
Biblio... Biblio... Biblioteca.

54:54.130 --> 54:56.360
Oh.

54:56.466 --> 54:58.934
Look. We'll be out of this thing
in 60 seconds.

55:01.504 --> 55:03.563
Hey, hey, Officer.
What's goin' on?

55:03.673 --> 55:06.039
CHips. L... I like that show.

55:06.175 --> 55:09.440
You kinda like a chocolate CHip.
You know what I'm say... CHip ahoy.

55:09.545 --> 55:11.945
- Is everything okay?
- What's up, brother? I can see...

55:12.048 --> 55:15.040
it's a little hot out here
and you got...

55:15.184 --> 55:18.711
Look, man, I'm just tryin' to take
my family down to the reunion.

55:18.821 --> 55:22.052
You know what I'm saying?
So, can you hook a brother up, brother?

55:24.360 --> 55:26.555
Under arrest? All of us?

55:26.663 --> 55:28.927
- For what, man?
- Like you don't know.

55:29.032 --> 55:31.432
You got those rapper rims
wrapped around your tires...

55:31.534 --> 55:34.560
like you had your lips
wrapped around this here reefer pipe.

55:34.671 --> 55:36.696
You should be
ashamed of yourself...

55:36.806 --> 55:40.537
using that poor little girl
like a pack mule.

55:40.677 --> 55:42.645
If we were
two counties south...

55:42.745 --> 55:44.645
you would be in the chair.

55:44.747 --> 55:46.772
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, and I'll sue. I'll sue.

55:46.916 --> 55:49.316
- As a matter of fact, open the gate.
- Nate, come on.

55:49.419 --> 55:52.718
No. Dorothy, let me tell... Open up.
Ain't nothin' but space and opportunity.

55:52.822 --> 55:54.915
That's right.
Look at big, old...

55:55.024 --> 55:58.460
So, what's that gonna be? What you
gonna do with that? I mean...

55:58.561 --> 56:00.495
Daddy!

56:02.665 --> 56:04.633
Mama.

56:06.769 --> 56:09.033
Oh.

56:09.138 --> 56:12.437
Hey. Hey, brother.
L... I mean, Officer.

56:12.575 --> 56:15.043
Hey, I apologize.

56:15.144 --> 56:18.341
- So, can we all go now?
- Tell it to the judge on Monday.

56:18.448 --> 56:22.544
Monday? Man, I gotta be
in Caruthersville by tomorrow.

56:24.721 --> 56:26.814
I don't care
where the hell you gotta be.

56:26.923 --> 56:28.857
You stay in here,
and you shut up.

56:28.958 --> 56:31.188
I have an audit tomorrow.

56:31.294 --> 56:34.957
Destiny.
Muffins.

56:35.064 --> 56:39.262
- Tell your mother for me...
- You told me not to talk to drug dealers.

56:39.368 --> 56:42.394
- What is goin' on?
- I said shut it!

56:42.505 --> 56:44.735
Uh, excuse me, Sheriff.

56:44.874 --> 56:48.002
If you use the 1 040 long form...

56:48.144 --> 56:50.669
you can write off
more than just those doughnuts.

56:50.813 --> 56:53.782
What else can I write off?

57:02.325 --> 57:05.226
- Ma's a saint, huh?
- Yeah, she nice.

57:05.328 --> 57:08.195
She all right.

57:08.297 --> 57:11.232
Still gonna go to
Harold's Waffles and Check Cashing...

57:11.334 --> 57:13.302
to get my taxes done.

57:15.404 --> 57:18.840
See, Officer, your biggest problem was
not enough pretax write-offs.

57:18.975 --> 57:21.466
- That's all.
- Oh.

57:21.611 --> 57:24.136
Well, um, thank you, pretty lady.

57:24.280 --> 57:27.044
Um, uh, what can I do for you?

57:27.150 --> 57:29.118
How about the keys?

57:40.129 --> 57:43.098
Nate. The reunion's tomorrow.

57:43.199 --> 57:46.862
We're out of cash.
We... We look a mess.

57:46.969 --> 57:48.994
Let's just pull over
and get ourselves together.

57:49.105 --> 57:51.573
Oh, no. No, no.
Dorothy, no.

57:51.707 --> 57:53.902
Nothing is gonna stop me
from getting that trophy.

57:54.043 --> 57:56.511
And with no food stops,
no bathroom breaks...

57:56.612 --> 57:58.580
anybody that's tired
can sleep in the car.

57:58.681 --> 58:00.672
Nate, no. Nate!

58:00.817 --> 58:02.614
Look at our kids.

58:07.623 --> 58:09.989
- Okay.
- Okay.

58:10.092 --> 58:12.185
All right. I hear you.

58:12.295 --> 58:14.195
We'll pull over.

58:14.297 --> 58:15.559
Thank you.

58:29.512 --> 58:31.605
Oh. No way.

58:32.882 --> 58:35.612
Uh-uh. Nope. That's it.

58:35.718 --> 58:37.845
Hold on. We're goin'.

58:41.490 --> 58:45.859
Fine, Nate. You can drag us
to this family reunion if you want to.

58:45.962 --> 58:50.058
But don't expect me to pretend like
everything's perfect just to impress your mama.

58:50.166 --> 58:52.225
What?
What do you mean by that?

58:52.335 --> 58:54.963
I mean, if she asks me
how we're doing, I'm gon' tell her.

58:55.071 --> 58:57.972
- No, you not! No! No, Dorothy, no.
- Mm-hmm!

58:58.107 --> 59:01.008
That woman has been against
our marriage from the very beginning.

59:01.110 --> 59:03.010
I don't care
how hard you try.

59:03.112 --> 59:06.843
- You will not give her the satisfaction of being right!
- Heh. Watch me.

59:21.230 --> 59:24.131
Nate, how long has that
warning light been on?

59:24.233 --> 59:26.793
Don't worry.
We're not gonna run out of gas.

59:26.903 --> 59:28.871
Trust me.

59:36.145 --> 59:38.613
- Oh, shoot.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding.

59:38.748 --> 59:40.648
Ahh.

59:43.352 --> 59:45.320
Come on!

59:48.591 --> 59:50.491
Come on. Come on.

59:50.593 --> 59:52.493
All right, c...

59:54.597 --> 59:56.895
Okay. All right.
Look, don't panic.

59:56.999 --> 59:59.399
We can still make it
to the reunion.

59:59.502 --> 01:00:01.970
All right,
I'll just make a call.

01:00:02.071 --> 01:00:04.972
Oh, come on. I forgot
to recharge the batteries.

01:00:05.074 --> 01:00:07.668
Oh, you gotta be kidding.

01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:12.406
Oh, look. Looks like there's a phone
a couple miles up the road.

01:00:12.548 --> 01:00:14.982
- A couple miles?
- I'll be right back.

01:00:15.084 --> 01:00:17.484
- You're not gonna...
- I'll be right back.

01:00:17.586 --> 01:00:19.486
Nate!

01:00:24.193 --> 01:00:26.093
Oh, man.

01:00:26.195 --> 01:00:28.095
I should run a little bit.

01:00:28.197 --> 01:00:30.097
Okay.

01:00:30.199 --> 01:00:32.167
That's enough of that.

01:00:39.842 --> 01:00:42.106
Wait. What's up?
What's up?

01:00:45.281 --> 01:00:48.409
All right, let's see.

01:00:48.517 --> 01:00:52.783
All right, let's just find a phone,
call Uncle Earl.

01:00:52.888 --> 01:00:56.449
It'll be simple.
Be outta this thing.

01:00:56.559 --> 01:00:58.527
Aw, shoot.

01:01:00.596 --> 01:01:04.999
Oh, man.! Come on.!
The corn?

01:01:06.435 --> 01:01:08.903
I ain't goin' in no corn.
Nope.

01:01:15.611 --> 01:01:18.637
Yaah! Aah! Aah!

01:01:18.781 --> 01:01:22.342
This... This, uh...

01:01:30.693 --> 01:01:33.161
Oh, come on, man!

01:01:33.262 --> 01:01:35.992
Who would put a phone
up on a pole? Aww.!

01:01:36.098 --> 01:01:39.795
Here we go. Right hand, left foot.
Left foot, right hand.

01:01:39.902 --> 01:01:41.836
Just like Twister.

01:01:41.937 --> 01:01:44.906
Don't look down.
Don't look down.

01:01:45.975 --> 01:01:48.876
Okay. All right. All right.

01:01:52.848 --> 01:01:55.476
Hello? Operator.

01:01:55.584 --> 01:01:58.246
I need EarlJohnson.

01:01:58.354 --> 01:02:00.288
Could you get me
EarlJohnson?

01:02:00.389 --> 01:02:03.381
Uncle Earl! This is Nate!
Yeah, right, right. Glorietta's boy.

01:02:03.492 --> 01:02:06.689
We ran out of gas on Route 1 2.
Can you come get us?

01:02:39.295 --> 01:02:42.560
Looks like y'all seen a ghost.

01:02:42.665 --> 01:02:46.328
It's just you, Uncle Earl.

01:02:46.435 --> 01:02:49.370
Yeah, it's just me. Who you thought
it was gonna be? Bobby Brown?

01:02:49.472 --> 01:02:53.806
That the older girl back there? Girl,
you as pretty as new carpet! Look at her!

01:02:53.943 --> 01:02:55.843
Where you stayin'?

01:02:55.945 --> 01:02:57.845
Well, we're on our way to the...

01:02:57.947 --> 01:02:59.847
- Y'all gon' go down to the house?
- Yeah.

01:02:59.949 --> 01:03:03.851
I got room for ya.
Yeah, girl, I got double-wide bunk beds.

01:03:03.953 --> 01:03:06.854
Yeah, you come up there,
I'll sleep on top, you be on the bottom.

01:03:06.956 --> 01:03:09.857
Either way. You be on bottom, I be on top.
I take it any way I can get it!

01:03:09.959 --> 01:03:12.860
I'll take it any way I can get it!

01:03:12.962 --> 01:03:16.693
- I said I'll take it any way I can get it!
- I heard you.

01:03:16.866 --> 01:03:19.858
Get that hood off.
First thing I gotta do.

01:03:19.969 --> 01:03:21.630
Boy, give me the jackhammer.

01:03:21.737 --> 01:03:23.932
- All right.
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:29.778 --> 01:03:32.303
- Here you are.
- Set it down there.

01:03:33.883 --> 01:03:37.944
- Whoa!
- Here we go! Here we go! That's right!

01:03:38.053 --> 01:03:40.453
Here we go!
There it is!

01:03:40.556 --> 01:03:43.616
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Watch our headlights!

01:03:43.726 --> 01:03:45.921
Looks like y'all ain't
gon' need these fog lights.

01:03:46.028 --> 01:03:48.121
I think we just need some gas.

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:50.130
Gas? Heh!

01:03:50.232 --> 01:03:53.633
You want gas,
you try some of Glorietta's pinto beans.

01:03:53.736 --> 01:03:56.136
Don't worry.
I'll work out a plan.

01:03:56.238 --> 01:03:59.071
Fourteen, 1 5 years, I know
a little somethin' 'bout a car, okay?

01:03:59.208 --> 01:04:03.235
You just... You keep them little sweet
legs on the inside and don't get hurt.

01:04:03.379 --> 01:04:06.280
Sitting there lookin' hot butter.
Hot butter yellow!

01:04:06.382 --> 01:04:08.475
Girl is lookin' good.!

01:04:08.584 --> 01:04:10.848
Here, boy.

01:04:12.888 --> 01:04:16.790
Look like I'm gon' use my heavy artillery.
Lemme get the tweezers.

01:04:16.892 --> 01:04:21.261
These my eyelash curlers. Yeah, that's
more delicate. That's more delicate.

01:04:21.363 --> 01:04:24.127
Uh, all right.

01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:26.098
No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:29.538 --> 01:04:31.301
- Ahh.
- You need this?

01:04:31.407 --> 01:04:33.307
Okay,
hold on to that.

01:04:33.442 --> 01:04:35.410
Oh, God. You're killin' me, Unc.

01:04:35.544 --> 01:04:37.535
Yo, Unc, come on.
Come on.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.707
Now hold this and lean that...
lean that over there for me.

01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:44.717
Now hand me
the duct tape.

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.482
What?

01:04:49.091 --> 01:04:51.992
Oh!

01:04:54.797 --> 01:04:57.265
Yeah, these are trusty-dusties.

01:04:57.366 --> 01:04:59.266
Always use them.

01:04:59.368 --> 01:05:02.360
Yeah, one of the best things
you can use is a curling iron.

01:05:02.471 --> 01:05:04.371
So, you fixed it, Earl?

01:05:04.473 --> 01:05:06.304
Uh-oh.

01:05:07.610 --> 01:05:09.635
There's two answers to that one...

01:05:09.778 --> 01:05:11.678
No and not yet.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.807
What I realize is...
It's a funny thing. Y'all ain't got no gas.!

01:05:15.918 --> 01:05:19.183
- That's what I told you.
- All this time, you didn't have no gas!

01:05:19.288 --> 01:05:21.688
But I'll get this thing runnin'.

01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:24.987
It'll run on lawn mower fluid.
Put lawn mower fluid in there.

01:05:25.094 --> 01:05:27.995
You won't go as fast.
You'll go about 1 6 miles an hour.

01:05:28.097 --> 01:05:30.998
So I'd always say
stay in the slow lane.

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:33.000
It's gon' take you about, oh...

01:05:33.102 --> 01:05:35.935
gon' take about 1 6, 1 7 days
to get back to California.

01:05:36.038 --> 01:05:38.768
- What?
- But y'all a family. Y'all'll have a good time.

01:05:38.907 --> 01:05:43.742
I know exactly what to do to have
this car back up on its feet and rollin'.

01:06:03.799 --> 01:06:06.063
Baby, how you doin'?

01:06:09.972 --> 01:06:11.872
There you go.

01:06:12.007 --> 01:06:14.271
Thank you.

01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:16.878
Just what you think you doin'?

01:06:17.012 --> 01:06:19.412
Stickin' your fingers in my food.

01:06:19.515 --> 01:06:21.813
Hey, Uncle Earl.!
Park around back.!

01:06:21.917 --> 01:06:24.317
I don't want nobody
messin' with my truck!

01:06:26.689 --> 01:06:28.384
All right.
I hear you, nephew.

01:06:34.196 --> 01:06:38.997
Hey, everybody.! Look who I found on
the side of the road.! It's Nate and them.!

01:06:39.101 --> 01:06:43.197
Just let us out right here.
This is good, right here.

01:06:45.307 --> 01:06:48.333
- Nathaniel! Come on. I'm gon' have to spank your butt.
- Oh, it's Uncle Nate.

01:06:48.477 --> 01:06:51.037
Oh, Lord have mercy.

01:06:53.415 --> 01:06:55.315
Girl, you look good.

01:06:55.417 --> 01:06:58.409
If you don't look like
hot sauce on a pork rind, I tell ya...

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.388
- Come on, give Earl some of that.
- Oh! Uh... Uh...

01:07:02.491 --> 01:07:04.925
You is a hot-buttered red bone...
Look at you, girl.!

01:07:05.027 --> 01:07:08.394
- You look delicious, like a perfect piece of fried chicken.
- Uncle Earl!

01:07:08.497 --> 01:07:11.625
Uncle Earl.! Come on, man.
That's my wife.

01:07:11.734 --> 01:07:14.464
- Come on, baby.
- Stop bein' a player-hater.

01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:18.097
- Can you do something with the truck?
- I'm gon' take care of that.

01:07:18.207 --> 01:07:20.107
Don't you worry about it.

01:07:20.242 --> 01:07:24.941
I'll take the carburetor off there,
put it back on, take the concrete off there.

01:07:25.047 --> 01:07:29.347
That'll be about $25-3 5. But just bring me
back a six-pack of beer, that's all.

01:07:29.451 --> 01:07:32.682
Look, there's the hill where
the tree was I told you I fell out of.

01:07:32.788 --> 01:07:35.222
- And there's the lake I used to fish...
- Hey, second-born!

01:07:35.324 --> 01:07:38.054
Junior Mint.!

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.560
Mama's little mistake
down at the lake.

01:07:40.662 --> 01:07:42.823
- How y'all doin'?
- Hey, Mack.

01:07:42.931 --> 01:07:46.799
- Hey, Dorothy. I don't know how you do it.
- Mack, how you doin'?

01:07:46.902 --> 01:07:49.803
Hey, look, Mama up here at the table.
Y'all come on.

01:07:49.905 --> 01:07:51.873
Ooh-wee!

01:07:53.108 --> 01:07:56.043
Hey, Mama!

01:07:56.145 --> 01:07:58.375
- Grandma!
- And there's the birthday girl!

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.380
Oh, look at you guys!

01:08:00.482 --> 01:08:03.713
My God! You're gettin' so big!
Look at you!

01:08:03.819 --> 01:08:08.119
Dorothy, I can't believe
we finally got you down here.

01:08:08.223 --> 01:08:11.124
I guess that means
you two are still together.

01:08:11.226 --> 01:08:13.387
Well, Glorietta,
the truth is that...

01:08:13.495 --> 01:08:16.555
- I can't believe you two made it this far.
- What you talkin' 'bout, Mama?

01:08:16.665 --> 01:08:20.192
- The trip's less than 2,000 miles.
- I'm not talkin' about miles.

01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:22.202
Talkin' 'bout years.

01:08:22.304 --> 01:08:24.568
Anyway,
what were you gonna say?

01:08:24.673 --> 01:08:27.140
What I was gonna say is...

01:08:27.242 --> 01:08:31.645
Nate and I are going to renew
our wedding vows on Valentine's Day...

01:08:31.747 --> 01:08:34.648
and we would sure love
for you to join us.

01:08:35.884 --> 01:08:38.853
Mmm.

01:08:38.953 --> 01:08:40.854
Come on, child.

01:08:40.956 --> 01:08:43.356
Food's on the table.
Family's waitin' for you.

01:08:43.459 --> 01:08:46.359
Both my boys here.
This is better than Christmas.!

01:08:46.462 --> 01:08:49.363
Even better than that Christmas
I got you that new car, Mama?

01:08:49.465 --> 01:08:51.558
Mack, you know
this ain't no competition.

01:08:51.667 --> 01:08:54.158
We gon' let Mack and Nate pray.

01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:58.296
See which one of'em was payin'
more attention in Sunday school.

01:08:58.407 --> 01:09:01.671
Well, I guess since I'm the oldest,
I go first.

01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:03.710
Fine.

01:09:03.812 --> 01:09:07.509
All right, everyone,
bow your heads...

01:09:07.616 --> 01:09:09.709
and close your ears.

01:09:09.818 --> 01:09:11.718
Your eyes.

01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:14.515
Everybody close your eyes.

01:09:17.024 --> 01:09:19.585
Gracious God, I come to you...

01:09:19.694 --> 01:09:21.595
as humbly as I know how...

01:09:21.697 --> 01:09:23.288
Yes, Lord.

01:09:23.398 --> 01:09:25.457
Praising you
and giving you thanks...

01:09:25.567 --> 01:09:28.296
for bringing us together
yet another year...

01:09:28.403 --> 01:09:32.066
helping us come together
to help celebrate...

01:09:32.207 --> 01:09:34.835
my victory...

01:09:34.977 --> 01:09:37.912
and Nate's agony of defeat.

01:09:38.013 --> 01:09:39.412
Let us eat.

01:09:39.515 --> 01:09:42.951
Father, Lord, we thank you...

01:09:43.051 --> 01:09:46.850
for allowing us to come together
and share with one another.

01:09:46.955 --> 01:09:50.913
Father, we know that you
created the birds that fly...

01:09:51.026 --> 01:09:55.122
and gave the dogs a voice to bark.

01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:57.460
But you wouldn't have
had to create the sun...

01:09:57.566 --> 01:10:01.696
if you knew Mack was gonna be sittin'
over there in that bright yellow shirt...

01:10:01.803 --> 01:10:04.704
lookin'sunny-side up like
a Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity.!

01:10:04.806 --> 01:10:07.366
- Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord!
- Mm-mmm-mmm.

01:10:07.509 --> 01:10:10.034
We, Father God, also realize...

01:10:10.178 --> 01:10:14.342
that you are the creator
of earth and heaven...

01:10:14.449 --> 01:10:17.748
moon and the stars.

01:10:17.853 --> 01:10:19.753
That's how I know...

01:10:19.855 --> 01:10:22.756
ain't no way
you had nothin' to do...

01:10:22.858 --> 01:10:26.851
with creatin' that tacky,
gangsta-lookin', wheel-spinnin'S.U. V...

01:10:26.962 --> 01:10:29.988
that Uncle Earl had to
drag up in here.

01:10:30.098 --> 01:10:34.501
Hold on, Father!
Hold up! Wait a minute!

01:10:34.603 --> 01:10:37.436
What about the time
you put pepto-Bismol in the Kool-Aid...

01:10:37.539 --> 01:10:39.871
and everybody had diarrhea
for the summer?

01:10:40.008 --> 01:10:42.704
- Don't let me have to mention that to Mama!
- Hold on.!

01:10:42.844 --> 01:10:46.245
What about the time you burned down
all the bushes 'round the house...

01:10:46.348 --> 01:10:49.215
'cause you got tired of goin'outside,
gettin'your own switch...

01:10:49.318 --> 01:10:53.379
Ohhh, Father!

01:10:55.657 --> 01:10:58.558
Need I have to remind Mack
while Mama's standin' here...

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:01.993
that he the one that had Nanette Green
in the back room...

01:11:02.097 --> 01:11:04.998
and was doin' the nasty
on Mama's good quilt...

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:08.001
and that's why she couldn't
get them stains off of it?

01:11:08.103 --> 01:11:10.901
In Jesus' name!
Let's eat.

01:11:11.006 --> 01:11:13.099
- But, Mama... B-But, Mama, look...
- Uh-uh.!

01:11:13.241 --> 01:11:15.869
Y'all just got through prayin'.
Don't make me cuss up in here.

01:11:16.011 --> 01:11:18.605
- Remember there was a lamp...
- Aah! I got all the stories.

01:11:18.747 --> 01:11:20.647
That's great.

01:11:20.749 --> 01:11:23.650
Let's go down here
and visit with Nate's family.

01:11:23.752 --> 01:11:26.050
Drove all the way here
from California.

01:11:26.154 --> 01:11:29.055
Last time they was here
little Destiny was two years old.

01:11:29.157 --> 01:11:31.421
Hey, Nate.
How you doin', kids?

01:11:31.526 --> 01:11:34.324
Hey, how's it goin'?

01:11:45.173 --> 01:11:47.073

01:12:07.095 --> 01:12:08.995
What about them glasses?

01:12:09.097 --> 01:12:12.999
Look... Look, man, I'll see if
I can do somethin' for you later.

01:12:13.101 --> 01:12:15.001

01:12:15.103 --> 01:12:17.503
You know you my favorite kinfolk.

01:12:17.606 --> 01:12:19.506
- I know.

01:12:19.641 --> 01:12:21.734
- I know you not.
- Watchin' every move.

01:12:21.877 --> 01:12:25.813
Why y'all leave me
over there with him?

01:12:25.947 --> 01:12:28.711
Hey, yo, Johnson family, it's time

Oh, there they go again.

01:13:00.215 --> 01:13:02.115
Stop that fightin;!

01:13:02.217 --> 01:13:04.515

Next event, the water

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:51.560
Somebody gonna get
a whuppin' out here.

Mack, that gives your family two points
and Nate's family two points.

01:13:57.339 --> 01:13:59.864
Last event... the sack race, y'all!

01:14:00.008 --> 01:14:03.967
Oh, yeah, baby. You can kiss
that Family of the Year trophy good-bye.

01:14:04.112 --> 01:14:06.012
Oh, I will...

01:14:06.114 --> 01:14:08.514
every mornin' on my way to work.

01:14:08.617 --> 01:14:10.881
Get set.! Go.!

01:14:14.122 --> 01:14:16.522
- Till you were 1 2!
- I ain't had no plastic on the bed.

01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:18.684
- Yes, you did, bed wetter.
- H-H-Hold up, man.

01:14:18.794 --> 01:14:21.058
- Ain't nobody peed in the bed.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:21.163 --> 01:14:24.291
- You act like you tryin'to pull somethin'...
- You always talkin' that stuff.

01:14:24.399 --> 01:14:26.594
I know that was you
that hung up on me.

01:14:26.701 --> 01:14:29.602
Whatever!

01:14:29.704 --> 01:14:31.262
Why you runnin'?

01:14:31.373 --> 01:14:33.534
Ain't nobody runnin'!

01:14:33.675 --> 01:14:36.701
- Throw him to the ground!
- Why you got my leg?

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:41.281
That's what I thought.
That's what I thought.

01:14:41.383 --> 01:14:44.181
- You done made us lose the race.
- I ain't thinkin' about that race.

01:14:44.286 --> 01:14:47.016
Why you tryin' to get ahead of me?
Why you tryin'...

01:14:47.122 --> 01:14:49.181
Why you lookin'...
I'm first! I'm first!

01:14:53.728 --> 01:14:56.128
I think I hurt my corn.

01:14:58.633 --> 01:15:02.433
We got a tie, y'all.
Ha-ha, Johnson family! What?

01:15:02.537 --> 01:15:04.437

01:15:04.539 --> 01:15:07.770

01:15:11.012 --> 01:15:12.980
Let me hold somethin'.

01:15:17.719 --> 01:15:21.780
I don't have no money on me right now.
You know? I'm broke.

01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:23.790
- You ain't got nothin'?
- Nada.

01:15:23.892 --> 01:15:26.861
What about them tennis shoes right there?
What size those?

01:15:26.962 --> 01:15:29.157
They're my size.

01:15:30.198 --> 01:15:32.098
You trippin'.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.100

01:15:34.202 --> 01:15:37.262
That's right. You know how we do it
Johnson family style.

01:15:37.372 --> 01:15:40.830
It's time to really get our party on now.
Come on, Johnsons!

01:15:40.976 --> 01:15:44.036
There's no time to rehearse.
It's time for someJohnson magic.

01:15:44.179 --> 01:15:46.079
This is for the trophy.

01:15:46.181 --> 01:15:49.446
- The talent show is the tiebreaker event.
- Right.

01:15:49.551 --> 01:15:52.782
Destiny and I will do choreography.
But what do we do for costumes?

01:15:52.888 --> 01:15:55.118
- Mama, I'll do it.
- What about the music?

01:15:55.223 --> 01:15:57.248
I got the music.

01:15:59.027 --> 01:16:01.928

01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:04.931

Their moves are so tight.

01:16:50.111 --> 01:16:52.511
I see why they win every year.

01:16:52.614 --> 01:16:56.311
Oh, come on, baby. It's nothing.
Look at Mack out there.

01:16:56.418 --> 01:17:00.912

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:48.998
Calm down. Calm down.

01:22:00.488 --> 01:22:03.013
Damn.

01:22:03.124 --> 01:22:05.024
How you doin'?

01:22:05.126 --> 01:22:07.185

01:22:21.643 --> 01:22:23.907
Oh, Father.

01:22:27.482 --> 01:22:29.382
You know what?

01:22:29.484 --> 01:22:32.385
I just realized I don't need this trophy
to prove I have a great family.

01:22:32.487 --> 01:22:34.318
Here.

01:22:34.422 --> 01:22:39.018

01:22:55.076 --> 01:22:58.170
We should be teammates,
not competitors.

01:22:59.547 --> 01:23:01.447
- Yeah...
- What do you say?

01:23:01.549 --> 01:23:03.517
Yeah, you're right, Nate.

01:23:04.552 --> 01:23:07.077
Yes! Yes!
We got it! Come on.

01:23:07.188 --> 01:23:10.089
Yes! I got the trophy!

01:23:10.191 --> 01:23:12.421
Anyway, you know what?

01:23:12.527 --> 01:23:16.429
- I realize that after this victory today...
- Yeah?

01:23:16.531 --> 01:23:18.465
Nothing can separate us.

01:23:26.107 --> 01:23:28.234
Get out the way, june bug!

01:23:30.111 --> 01:23:32.477
Where the truck come from?

01:23:36.517 --> 01:23:40.248
Oh, Father!
Oh, Father!

01:23:40.355 --> 01:23:42.653
I'm okay, baby.

01:23:42.757 --> 01:23:45.385
Oh, Lord, why not me?

01:23:45.493 --> 01:23:47.393
Jesus, why not me?

01:23:47.495 --> 01:23:51.397
I can't believe this!

01:23:51.499 --> 01:23:55.333
This trophy ain't never
done nothin' to nobody!

01:23:55.436 --> 01:23:58.064
What did I ever do?

01:23:58.172 --> 01:24:01.335
What did I do?
Oh, Father!

01:24:01.476 --> 01:24:03.376
Who beat me?

01:24:03.478 --> 01:24:05.446
What is he doing?

01:24:07.248 --> 01:24:09.148
Oh, my God.

01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:11.844
- Stan, what are you doing here?
- Yeah!

01:24:11.953 --> 01:24:14.854
Dorothy, you said...

01:24:14.956 --> 01:24:17.516
you wanted
to be with me forever.

01:24:17.625 --> 01:24:20.992
I said our professor
was lecturing forever.

01:24:21.095 --> 01:24:23.996
- Man, are you the dude drivin' the truck?
- Stan, you are crazy.

01:24:24.098 --> 01:24:26.498
We only studied together twice.

01:24:26.601 --> 01:24:29.161
And one of those times
was over the phone!

01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:32.171
- I have a husband!
- Yeah, she has a husband!

01:24:32.273 --> 01:24:34.764
You ruin my family reunion
with this nonsense?

01:24:34.909 --> 01:24:38.606
If that's the case, then why do you two
live in separate houses?

01:24:38.746 --> 01:24:40.646
Yeah.

01:24:40.748 --> 01:24:43.945
Why do you live
in separate houses?

01:24:46.053 --> 01:24:50.990
Mama, Dorothy and I have been
separated for about three months.

01:24:51.092 --> 01:24:52.992
Ohh!

01:24:53.094 --> 01:24:55.460
I knew it.
I knew it!

01:24:55.563 --> 01:24:59.465
Look, it's all my fault why
we're not together. All right?

01:24:59.567 --> 01:25:02.468
I just haven't supported her
in her dreams.

01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:05.334
She's a beautiful,
intelligent woman...

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.431
and the copilot of my plane.

01:25:07.542 --> 01:25:11.034
Nate got a plane?
Mama, where did Nate get a plane?

01:25:11.179 --> 01:25:13.409
Mack, will you hush, please.

01:25:13.514 --> 01:25:18.451
And, Mama, look, I've let you drive a wedge
between me and my wife for all these years.

01:25:18.553 --> 01:25:21.488
Furthermore, she's the mother
of your grandchildren.

01:25:21.589 --> 01:25:25.423
So I suggest you get used to her,
because I'm not letting her go anywhere.

01:25:25.526 --> 01:25:27.426
Ah!

01:25:27.528 --> 01:25:31.055
- And neither am I.
- You know what? That's about enough of you.

01:25:31.165 --> 01:25:33.599
- Uh-uh! No, no, no, no!
- Dad, don't do that!

01:25:33.701 --> 01:25:36.465
Would you leave, Stan? Please!

01:25:36.571 --> 01:25:38.129
Wait! Don't do it, son.

01:25:38.239 --> 01:25:42.198
- Let me!
- Ohh!

01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:44.505
Mama cracked him!
Mama say c-crack!

01:25:44.645 --> 01:25:47.546
Mama was your dessert!
That's what theJohnsons do!

01:25:47.648 --> 01:25:49.548
She's still got it.

01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:51.550
You know what?

01:25:51.652 --> 01:25:54.450
I ain't never heard you
talk about Dorothy that way.

01:25:54.555 --> 01:25:56.455
And you know what else?

01:25:56.557 --> 01:25:58.354
It's about time.

01:26:00.695 --> 01:26:02.595
- Thank you, Mama.
- That's right, Dad.

01:26:02.697 --> 01:26:05.222
All right, I gotta get my family outta here.
We gotta head back home.

01:26:05.333 --> 01:26:07.233
But you just got here.!

01:26:07.335 --> 01:26:09.235
I know, but...

01:26:09.337 --> 01:26:11.805
my wife has a test to study for.

01:26:13.241 --> 01:26:16.540
- Kids, let's go change. Bye, Mama.
- Bye, baby.

01:26:18.412 --> 01:26:21.074
- Dorothy.
- All right, now, little brother.

01:26:21.182 --> 01:26:23.082
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye, D.J.

01:26:23.184 --> 01:26:26.085
- Y'all come back! Don't stay gone so long.
- All right.

01:26:26.187 --> 01:26:28.155
Oh, man.

01:26:29.557 --> 01:26:31.024
- Yeah.!
- Nate! Nate!

01:26:31.125 --> 01:26:34.288
It's NateJohnson! All day!

01:26:34.395 --> 01:26:36.386
Trophy and my little brother?

01:26:36.497 --> 01:26:40.661
And I'm MackJohnson!
That's all week.!

01:26:40.768 --> 01:26:43.669
I wonder... I wonder if Uncle Earl
know how to fix this.

01:26:43.771 --> 01:26:46.467
I'm gon' ask... Uncle Earl!

01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:51.071
Hey!

01:26:51.212 --> 01:26:53.112
Huh!

01:26:53.214 --> 01:26:55.079
Huh! Yeah!

01:26:57.885 --> 01:27:00.353
- Reenie?
- Yeah, baby?

01:27:00.454 --> 01:27:02.684
Get in here, girl!

01:27:13.401 --> 01:27:16.495
D.J., is that our door?

01:27:16.604 --> 01:27:20.472
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Is this our bumper?

01:27:20.608 --> 01:27:23.509
- This is the bumper from the truck.
- Looks like it, but...

01:27:26.113 --> 01:27:29.514
And... these are the seats.

01:27:29.617 --> 01:27:32.518
Oh, my God. These seats
come right out of the truck.

01:27:34.155 --> 01:27:36.487
Dorothy, that is the door.!

01:27:36.591 --> 01:27:38.582
Looks like the door.
We don't know.

01:27:38.693 --> 01:27:42.652
You ain't got nothin' on that Robot.
You know, I do the Robot.

01:27:45.066 --> 01:27:46.761
Oh, my God!

01:27:46.867 --> 01:27:49.097
Move somethin;!

01:27:49.203 --> 01:27:52.195
- That's my kid!
- Look.

01:27:54.609 --> 01:27:56.509
Okay. Okay.

01:27:56.611 --> 01:27:58.101
Uncle Earl!

01:28:00.114 --> 01:28:02.378
Uncle Earl!
Uncle Earl!

01:28:04.318 --> 01:28:06.218
Oh, hey there, nephew.

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.255
Y'all caught me off guard.
Caught me doin' my little thing...

01:28:09.357 --> 01:28:11.348
Look at Dorothy.

01:28:11.459 --> 01:28:13.154
Girl, you look good.

01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:16.593
Girl, if you don't look like
a hot cup of soup, and I got the flu...

01:28:21.268 --> 01:28:23.395
- This my baby, Tangerine.
- Hi!

01:28:23.504 --> 01:28:25.563
Yeah, don't she look like you?

01:28:25.673 --> 01:28:30.576
She look just like you. I tell her all
the time, "You look just like Dorothy. "

01:28:30.678 --> 01:28:33.943
You know what, Dorothy?
This could've all been yours. All this...

01:28:35.983 --> 01:28:37.883
Reenie, come on, now.

01:28:37.985 --> 01:28:40.010
Quit playin'.
You know I'm p-I-M-p.

01:28:40.121 --> 01:28:43.215
If you don't mind, it's been a long trip
and we wanna get back home...

01:28:43.324 --> 01:28:45.224
so, did you fix the truck yet?

01:28:45.326 --> 01:28:48.386
Oh, yeah, it's ready.
Truck is ready. That's what I do.

01:28:48.496 --> 01:28:50.396
Yeah, come on out.
Yeah.

01:28:51.432 --> 01:28:53.866
Yes, indeedy!

01:28:53.968 --> 01:28:56.937
Now, I'm gon' have to tell you...

01:28:57.038 --> 01:29:00.872
the only thing I had to do here that was
really special... want you to be aware of...

01:29:01.008 --> 01:29:03.909
I had to run a coat hanger
through the middle of the vehicle.

01:29:04.011 --> 01:29:07.071
It came up around the chassis,
broke off on each side...

01:29:07.214 --> 01:29:09.409
and go into your wheel well.

01:29:09.517 --> 01:29:14.216
Now, the only thing I suggest is
that you don't make no sharp turns.

01:29:14.321 --> 01:29:16.050
- Okay?
- Great.

01:29:16.157 --> 01:29:19.126
A sharp turn, and you can
hang it up.

01:29:21.328 --> 01:29:23.489
- "You can hang it up. "
- Yeah.

01:29:23.597 --> 01:29:25.497
- I tell ya.!
- Funny.

01:29:25.599 --> 01:29:28.090
Okay, here we go.

01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:35.106
Ohh-ho-ho.!

01:29:35.242 --> 01:29:37.142
Cool!

01:29:37.244 --> 01:29:39.269
That looks great, Uncle Earl!

01:29:39.413 --> 01:29:42.007
- That look good, don't it?
- All right!

01:29:42.116 --> 01:29:44.141
- All right!
- I retooled your engine.

01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:46.811
I flushed the engine out
with a toothpaste flush.

01:29:46.921 --> 01:29:49.446
- Fluoride toothpaste. Best thing for it.
- Earl!

01:29:49.557 --> 01:29:53.789
Hold it. There's something... You know what
this car doesn't have in it? An eight-track.

01:29:53.894 --> 01:29:57.352
A pretty car like this
ain't got no eight-track!

01:29:57.465 --> 01:30:01.060
I put an eight-track in. Gon' be real nice
for y'all to listen to on the way home.

01:30:01.168 --> 01:30:03.068
Look at Dorothy.
Look at Dorothy.

01:30:03.170 --> 01:30:07.300
Girl, if you don't look like a free case
of motor oil... 30-weight.

01:30:07.441 --> 01:30:10.410
All right, I told you
about coveting my wife, now.

01:30:18.986 --> 01:30:21.614
Hey, Destiny,
where's Sir Barks-A-Lot?

01:30:21.722 --> 01:30:24.520
He doesn't need me anymore.
He's gonna stay in Missouri.

01:30:24.625 --> 01:30:27.025
He'll be okay.

01:30:27.128 --> 01:30:29.619
I'm sure he will, sweetie.

01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:33.530
Nate, did you really mean
all the things you said...

01:30:33.634 --> 01:30:35.465
about supporting my dreams?

01:30:35.569 --> 01:30:37.469
Every word.

01:30:37.571 --> 01:30:39.630
Oh, baby. Mmm!

01:31:11.305 --> 01:31:13.205
Goodness!

01:31:13.307 --> 01:31:15.298
Oh, boy.

01:31:15.409 --> 01:31:17.309
- Home, sweet home, huh?
- Yes.!

01:31:17.411 --> 01:31:19.845
I cannot wait to change these clothes
and take a shower.

01:31:19.947 --> 01:31:22.074
I wasn't gonna say nothin',
but, whoa!

01:31:22.183 --> 01:31:24.515
- Come on, guys. Inside.
- It's all up here.

01:31:24.618 --> 01:31:26.415
We gon' do it again.
I tell you...

01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:31.951
- Oh, Daddy, our car!
- Ohh!

01:31:33.928 --> 01:31:36.192
Oh, Earl! Come on, Earl!

01:31:37.865 --> 01:31:40.561
31 0 will never
take this truck back now.

01:31:40.668 --> 01:31:45.264
Oh, Nate, stop worrying about the truck.
You've got more important work to do.

01:31:45.372 --> 01:31:49.035
After all, it's been... three months.

01:31:50.244 --> 01:31:53.213
You serious, Dorothy?
Huh!

01:31:53.347 --> 01:31:56.248
- You serious?
- Ninety days!

01:31:57.284 --> 01:31:59.184
Uh, Nate gon' play!

01:31:59.286 --> 01:32:02.084
Yea-eah! Open the door!

01:35:54.588 --> 01:35:57.489
Ain't that the girl?
Ain't that the only girl?

01:35:57.591 --> 01:35:59.491
She a pretty girl.

01:35:59.593 --> 01:36:01.493
- Girl, you as pretty as paneling.
- Ohh.!

01:36:01.595 --> 01:36:03.495
Pretty as wood paneling.

01:36:03.597 --> 01:36:05.997
And, Dorothy,
you know you ain't changed.

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:09.001
You just as pretty as...
Look at you.! Lord, have mercy.!

01:36:09.103 --> 01:36:11.003
Ooh, you just draw me in.!

01:36:11.105 --> 01:36:15.439
Dorothy, I tell you... I tell you, girl,
you know, you is gorgeous.!
