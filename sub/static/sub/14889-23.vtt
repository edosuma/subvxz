10:59.826 --> 11:02.362
No, no sign of Yeorgi.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.666
But I did meet
a couple of nice pigeons.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.235
They’re going to ask around.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.008
Balki, it’s‐it’s
freezing in here.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.711
Eat your oatmeal, cousin.
It’ll warm you up.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.350
Don’t you think if Yeorgi
were gonna come back

11:24.384 --> 11:25.952
he’d be here by now?

11:25.986 --> 11:27.387
I don’t know, cousin.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.422
Single bird, big town...

11:32.458 --> 11:34.160
Listen, Balki, sooner or later

11:34.194 --> 11:35.829
you‐you’re gonna have
to face the fact

11:35.862 --> 11:37.931
that Yeorgi may be
gone for good.

11:39.232 --> 11:44.137
Cousin, you can check
your negativity at the door.

11:44.170 --> 11:47.007
I have faith that Yeorgi’s
going to come home.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.942
And let me tell you this...

11:48.975 --> 11:51.344
...I’m not going to rest
until he does.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.983
Balki? Balki...
Uh‐ho.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.384
Alright. Come on. Come on.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.054
Come on. You are exhausted.

12:01.087 --> 12:02.856
You’re going to bed.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.257
No. Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, cousin.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.859
Cousin, cousin. I‐I can’t.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.161
Someone has to be here
to‐to‐to sit by the window

12:08.194 --> 12:09.262
and welcome Yeorgi home.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.798
I’ll wait for him.
You go to bed.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.466
Thank you.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.002
I just hope he hasn’t
hooked up with some crows

12:16.036 --> 12:17.504
and picked up bad habits.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.948
[door closes]

12:30.250 --> 12:31.384
‐Cousin?
‐Yeah.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.987
By the way,
I nailed the window open

12:34.020 --> 12:35.889
so the wind
wouldn’t blow it shut.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.859
Good idea.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.126
’Get some sleep.’

12:42.362 --> 12:44.831
[knock on door]

12:44.865 --> 12:46.066
[door closes]

12:48.268 --> 12:50.103
[wind howling]

12:50.136 --> 12:51.572
Oh.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.373
Uh.

12:53.406 --> 12:57.010
Hi, I’m going to the bakery.
Do you want any...

12:57.043 --> 12:59.479
Harry, it’s freezing in here.
What’s going on?

12:59.513 --> 13:01.447
Well, Y‐Yeorgi
flew away last night

13:01.481 --> 13:04.350
and Balki won’t close
the window until he comes back.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.386
Comes back?
It’s ten below out there.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.088
Tell me about it.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.558
By now, Yeorgi is a bird‐sicle
lying beak up somewhere.

13:13.527 --> 13:16.462
Oh, that’s terrible.
Poor Balki.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.264
Maybe, you should
get him another bird.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.001
Balki doesn’t want another bird.
He wants Yeorgi.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.969
Well, If you get him a bird
that looks just like Yeorgi

13:23.003 --> 13:24.938
maybe he won’t know
the difference.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.941
Um, nah. It wouldn’t work.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.043
As soon as Balki found out
that the bird couldn’t talk

13:30.076 --> 13:31.545
he’d know it wasn’t Yeorgi.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.080
Well, it’s easily explained,
the trauma of being lost

13:34.114 --> 13:36.517
coupled with the intense cold,
caused temporary amnesia.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.919
It happens with tropical birds.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.454
It does?

13:41.487 --> 13:44.224
Well...you believed it,
didn’t you?

13:47.427 --> 13:49.896
You are devious. Ha.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.231
I like that in a woman.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.866
[Jennifer chuckles]

13:52.899 --> 13:54.535
My friend Jack owns a pet store.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.970
I’ll go down there,
see if he has a bird like Yeorgi

13:57.003 --> 13:59.940
if he does, I’ll buy it
and your troubles are over.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.975
Jack?

14:03.443 --> 14:06.412
‐Larry! He’s 79 years old.
‐Oh.

14:07.548 --> 14:09.049
How tall is he?

14:11.417 --> 14:13.620
‐Larry.
‐I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

14:13.654 --> 14:16.523
I’m freezing and‐and I’m not
thinking straight.

14:16.557 --> 14:18.158
Ju‐ju‐just call me
as soon as you get back.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.093
I will.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.995
You know, um...

14:22.028 --> 14:23.530
...you’re kinda cute
when you’re jealous.

14:23.564 --> 14:24.931
Mm.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.408
And Larry,
don’t worry about Jack.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.944
You’re a much better kisser
than he is.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.447
[instrumental music]

14:49.222 --> 14:50.323
You found a bird?

14:50.356 --> 14:52.258
That’s great.
Thank you, Jennifer.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.061
Yeah, I’ll be right up
to get him.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.930
Cousin, why aren’t you
at the window?

14:56.963 --> 14:58.398
I’m walking off a cramp.
Ow! Ooh!

14:58.431 --> 15:00.534
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!
Oh! There. It’s gone.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.068
[chuckles]

15:02.102 --> 15:03.069
No sign of Yeorgi yet?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.705
’Well, no, not yet,
but I got a feeling’

15:04.738 --> 15:07.708
something’s gonna pop
real soon.

15:07.741 --> 15:12.478
Cousin, the mandatory
29‐hour waiting period is up.

15:12.513 --> 15:15.115
Yeorgi is officially
a missing pet.

15:16.517 --> 15:19.520
And that means there’s only
one thing to be done.

15:19.553 --> 15:22.455
We have to go for broke.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.357
We have to pull out...

15:24.390 --> 15:26.560
...all the stops.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.129
We have to take
the bull by the corns.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.233
It’s time...

15:33.266 --> 15:35.702
...for the Vingi Vingi Bingi.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.241
"The Vingi Vingi Bingi?"

15:41.274 --> 15:43.409
The Vingi Vingi Bingi.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.212
The Myposian chant
for runaway pets.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.048
I didn’t want
to use it earlier.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.683
It’s quite potent.

15:49.716 --> 15:53.654
We could attract every runaway
dog and cat in the neighborhood.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.357
Well, I think
that’s an excellent idea.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.559
Well, now, don’t you...

15:58.592 --> 16:00.293
‐You do?
‐Oh, yeah.

16:00.326 --> 16:02.128
You know, I don’t usually
go in for this chant stuff

16:02.162 --> 16:04.665
but I have a feeling
this one’s gonna work.

16:04.698 --> 16:06.166
Yeah, I think,
there’s a good chance

16:06.199 --> 16:09.135
that this chant
will bring back your bird.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.237
Great, cousin.
Then, you‐you want to join me?

16:11.271 --> 16:12.773
You can do the backup.
I’ll teach you the steps.

16:12.806 --> 16:15.341
Yeah, tempting, Balki,
but I gotta run. Uh.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.376
Cousin, where’re you going?

16:16.409 --> 16:18.545
Well, they’re, uh,
salting Seventh Street.

16:18.579 --> 16:20.213
And you know
how I love to watch that.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.381
[chuckles]

16:21.414 --> 16:23.483
Come on, Balki, you’re cutting
into your chant time.

16:23.517 --> 16:24.718
Five, six, seven, eight...

16:24.751 --> 16:26.286
Hoo ha, hoo ha ha hoo.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.789
Hoo ha ha hoo.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.256
Hoo ha hoo ha. Hey!

16:30.290 --> 16:32.726
Vingi vingi vingi,
bingi yingi yingi.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.294
Yaku siki ye ye.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.797
Hoo ha ha hoo.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.265
Pedu pedu yuki.
Hoo ha hoo hoo.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.768
Vingi vingi vingi,
bingi yingi...

16:41.802 --> 16:44.370
Hoo ha, hoo ha ha hoo.

16:44.404 --> 16:47.608
Hoo ha, hoo ha ha hoo. Hey!

16:50.210 --> 16:53.179
[instrumental music]

16:56.617 --> 16:58.151
Here we go. Here we go.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.521
Good birdie.
Good birdie. Yeah.

17:00.554 --> 17:02.188
Here we go. Good birdie.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.724
Here we go.
Yeah, come here.

17:03.757 --> 17:06.291
Come here.
Come here. Come here.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.394
Yes, yes, good birdie.
Good Birdie.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.463
Alright now. Alright.

17:10.496 --> 17:12.365
Fly in to Balki. Okay?

17:12.397 --> 17:14.267
’Fly in to Balki.’

17:14.300 --> 17:15.569
Fly in to Balki.

17:15.602 --> 17:16.670
Come on.

17:18.271 --> 17:22.474
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.344
Come back. Come back.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.146
No. Oh!

17:26.179 --> 17:28.080
Yes, yes, come on,
come on, come on.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.616
Come on, come on. Yes.

17:29.650 --> 17:31.217
Come on, come on, come on.

17:31.251 --> 17:34.120
Oh! Come on. Come on.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.455
Come on, come on, come on.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.090
[squawks]

17:37.123 --> 17:40.160
Come, birdie. Come to Larry.
Come, come.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.494
[squawks]

17:41.528 --> 17:42.696
Come on.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.865
[squawks]

17:44.898 --> 17:45.999
Come on.

17:46.032 --> 17:50.303
Come to Larry before I wring
your little birdie neck.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.179
Yeorgi!

17:59.212 --> 18:01.548
Yeorgi! You came back.

18:01.582 --> 18:04.084
Yes. Yes!

18:10.423 --> 18:12.392
You know, you had me
worried sick.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.427
Now, go in there.
Go in there.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.196
You get in your cage, young man.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.531
Get in there.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.466
Now...I hope you know

18:20.500 --> 18:23.336
it’s going to be a long time
before I open this cage again.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.471
That’s a privilege
you’re going to have to earn.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.242
I hope someday
you have a bird of your own

18:29.275 --> 18:32.145
so you’ll know
what you put me through.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.479
Now, we say no more about it.

18:33.514 --> 18:35.682
The‐the important thing
is you’re okay.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.885
Cousin! Cousin!
Yeorgi came back!

18:38.919 --> 18:41.888
Oh! Oh, my Lord!
It’s a miracle.

18:42.956 --> 18:43.890
Well, I wouldn’t believe it

18:43.924 --> 18:45.559
if I wasn’t seeing it
with my own eyes.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.493
Well, just, let me look

18:47.528 --> 18:51.131
at the two of you
together again.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.701
Well, I just want
to savor this moment.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.237
Great, okay,
let’s close the window

18:57.270 --> 18:58.839
and get this place warmed up.

19:01.942 --> 19:03.544
Come on, Yeorgi.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.646
The first words I want
to hear out of your mouth are

19:05.679 --> 19:06.813
I’m sorry.

19:07.848 --> 19:10.751
Come on.
We all make mistakes.

19:10.784 --> 19:13.419
[panting]

19:14.921 --> 19:17.591
Cousin...something’s wrong.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.392
He’s not talking.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.828
Well, that’s easily explained.

19:21.862 --> 19:24.364
The trauma of being lost,
coupled with the intense cold

19:24.397 --> 19:25.666
caused temporary amnesia.

19:25.699 --> 19:28.602
It happens in tropical birds.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.271
‐It does?
‐Oh, sure. Ask Jennifer.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.375
I’m sure with some time
and loving care

19:35.408 --> 19:37.243
you can re‐teach him.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.245
Cousin, I don’t think
this is Yeorgi.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.981
Well, well,
of course it’s Yeorgi.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.283
What‐what other bird
would be zany enough

19:43.316 --> 19:45.619
to fly around
in weather like this?

19:45.652 --> 19:48.421
You crazy bird, you.

19:50.724 --> 19:53.994
I don’t know, his‐his
body language is different.

19:54.027 --> 19:57.664
And...he seems to be carrying
more weight in his face.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.602
Well, he’s probably
just retaining water.

20:03.604 --> 20:06.607
Squawk. Buenos dias.

20:10.010 --> 20:13.213
Mi casa es su casa.

20:16.550 --> 20:17.984
Oh, yeah, oh, Balki,
didn’t I tell you?

20:18.018 --> 20:19.452
Oh, no, he always
spoke Spanish.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.254
He just never did
while you were around.

20:21.287 --> 20:23.223
Hola. Como esta usted?

20:25.759 --> 20:28.461
You’re not buying
any of this, are you?

20:28.494 --> 20:31.231
Cousin, who is this stranger
in Yeorgi’s cage?

20:32.032 --> 20:34.467
Alright.
It’s not Yeorgi.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.469
But he was with Yeorgi
when he died.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.905
‐Cousin!
‐Oh, alright, Balki. Look.

20:38.939 --> 20:41.474
Oh, look, I asked Jennifer
to go out to a pet store

20:41.508 --> 20:43.409
and buy a bird
that looked like Yeorgi

20:43.443 --> 20:45.011
and then I came down
the fire escape

20:45.045 --> 20:47.614
and threw him
through the window.

20:47.648 --> 20:49.750
I should have realized
you’d know the difference.

20:50.784 --> 20:52.653
Well, thanks for trying so hard.

20:53.754 --> 20:55.488
Balki, what’re you doing?

20:55.522 --> 20:57.858
I’m waiting for Yeorgi.

20:57.891 --> 21:00.193
‐’Balki.’
‐Uh. Oh.

21:04.064 --> 21:06.066
Balki, listen to me.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.301
Look, Balki.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.571
Listen to me.

21:10.604 --> 21:12.773
Now, Yeorgi is not coming back.

21:12.806 --> 21:13.940
Now, I’m not saying that

21:13.974 --> 21:15.976
anything bad
has happened to him.

21:16.009 --> 21:18.745
In fact, he might be with
a very nice family some place.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.982
But wherever he is,
he is not coming back here.

21:22.015 --> 21:24.618
Never, as in forever.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.853
He’s history. He’s dead.

21:30.090 --> 21:31.457
[squawks]

21:33.960 --> 21:36.396
Don’t be ridiculous.
Don’t be ridiculous.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.864
Yeorgi, you came back!

21:37.898 --> 21:40.767
You came back.
You must be hungry.

21:40.801 --> 21:43.870
Here, here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

21:43.904 --> 21:46.873
Whoops. Come here.

21:46.907 --> 21:49.876
You see, cousin,
I told you he’d come back.

21:49.910 --> 21:51.712
Well, I‐I don’t believe it.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.780
I‐I really didn’t think
there was a chance

21:53.814 --> 21:55.816
we’d ever see Yeorgi again.

21:55.849 --> 21:58.451
Cousin, reciting
the Vingi Vingi Bingi

21:58.484 --> 22:00.654
works every time.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.823
I’m just glad
your bird came back.

22:02.856 --> 22:04.958
And if wanna believe the chant
had something to do with it

22:04.991 --> 22:06.927
well that’s just fine.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.563
But those of us
in the civilized world

22:09.596 --> 22:12.498
know that this was
just a coincidence.

22:12.533 --> 22:14.100
[dogs barking]

22:14.134 --> 22:15.401
[cats meowing]

22:20.774 --> 22:21.975
Oh, my Lord!

22:22.008 --> 22:25.345
There‐there must be a hundreds
of cats and dogs out there.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.414
Oh, really, cousin?

22:28.448 --> 22:30.951
Why? That’s quite a coincidence.

22:30.984 --> 22:32.452
Wouldn’t you say?

22:32.485 --> 22:34.521
[theme music]

22:41.461 --> 22:43.496
[music continues]
