-Got it!

No, I couldn't sleep
with all that sobbing.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.074
That was you, right?

08:53.157 --> 08:54.200
Oh, uh… [chuckles]

08:54.283 --> 08:56.994
Yeah, I wasn't sobbing. I was sniffling.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.414
I have a severe allergy
to hay, and manure,

09:00.498 --> 09:01.499
and loneliness.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.418
Elfo, never say
"loneliness" in a freak show.

09:04.502 --> 09:08.256
It's the worst word you can say,
apart from "freak" and "show."

09:08.339 --> 09:11.717
Oh, I get it.
It's because we're in a lonely freak show.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.094
Oh. Damn it.

09:13.177 --> 09:16.097
Don't take this the wrong way,
but shut up, Elfo.

Aw. You sound just like
my friends back home.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.851

you don't say here.

But I had big dreams.

Mora swam to Steamland
to make it in the moving pictures.

-Talent?
-No, legs.

09:33.114 --> 09:36.284
Hey, you did do those voices
for the Squalid Squirrel cartoons.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.994
Yeah. Dreams fulfilled.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.996
I saw one of your cartoons yesterday!

09:40.079 --> 09:43.499
Do you make things up as you go along?
Because that's what it felt like.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.127
You know what, Elfo? I don't like you.

09:46.752 --> 09:50.381
I don't like you, either.
You're lucky you're even in show business.

09:50.464 --> 09:53.134

ought to thank me.

-Zip it, Edith.
-Yeah, Edith.

10:07.189 --> 10:10.568
Hey, don't talk to her like that,
you big, fat phony!

10:10.651 --> 10:12.945
What did you just call me?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.989
-Ow!
-I learned that

10:29.295 --> 10:31.547
No, I meant figuratively.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.635
Say, you're starting
that island hunting resort

10:35.718 --> 10:37.553
for bored rich people, aren't you?

10:37.637 --> 10:40.556
If we can round up
enough exotic animals, yes.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.142
How'd you like a very fast elf?

10:43.225 --> 10:44.727
Will he scream when he's shot?

10:44.810 --> 10:46.896
Oh, yes, he's a screamer.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.105
[both cackling]

10:52.610 --> 10:55.321
You're, um, like, petting my eye. Yeesh!

10:55.404 --> 10:58.157
What the… You're not my royal kitty-cat!

10:58.240 --> 11:02.036
I am now, fatso. Call me, uh… Scruffles.

He questioned my sanity.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.515
Thanks for sticking up for me.
You're a brave guy.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.184
Aw. Thanks for not saying
"brave little guy."

I get so much of that
from my friend, Bean.

P.T. really had that punch comin'.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.233
[chuckles] Yeah. I got him
right in the eye with my tiny fist.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.485
Oh, my God, I'm insulting myself.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.613
At least you have a fist.
I don't have a body at all.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.115
That doesn't matter, Edith.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.742
We're all ashamed
of some flaw we can't change.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.703
[chuckles] I mean, every day I obsess
about my green skin,

11:44.787 --> 11:46.997
but obviously
there's nothing wrong with that.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.666
Nature is full of green.

11:48.749 --> 11:52.920
Bullfrogs are green, tree frogs are green,
pond frogs are green. [chuckles]

11:53.003 --> 11:55.923
The real problem
is this notch in my left ear.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.258
It's hideous.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.719
Oh, Elfo, an ear notch?
That's cage thinking.

12:00.803 --> 12:04.723
You can't be self-conscious
just because people gawk at you every day.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.434
-Hey, Edith?
-Yeah?

12:06.517 --> 12:10.020
I know you can't say "freak,"
and I know you can't say "home,"

12:10.104 --> 12:12.273
but is the word "pretty" okay?

12:12.356 --> 12:14.275
Well, it depends on the context.

12:14.358 --> 12:16.026
[Elfo] You've got a pretty voice.

12:16.110 --> 12:16.944
I'll allow it.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.366
Ruh-oh.

12:22.450 --> 12:27.580
Though I was next in line to be
King of Cats, I knew I had to vamoose.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.875
Like, leave my kingdom
and head out for adventure.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.002
Oh, I know that feeling.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.796
Uh, yeah, but, like, quiet,
we were talking about me.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.882
Though I have traveled the whole world,

12:37.965 --> 12:40.551
I think there is no finer place
to call my new home

12:40.634 --> 12:42.511
than, like, right here.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.429
Dreamland.

12:43.512 --> 12:47.266
You add a touch of class
to our humble, yokel-infested country.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.394
All right, uh, listen up.
I expect to live in a manner

12:50.478 --> 12:55.357
to which a royal personage such as myself
is, like, you know, accustomed.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.652
Guys, I don't know
what Scruffles the Cat is up to here,

12:58.736 --> 13:00.446
but it sure ain't the Luci Special.

13:00.529 --> 13:03.949
I bring good old-fashioned
psychological torture to the party, okay?

13:04.033 --> 13:05.576
Just like your grandmother made.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.078
Ah, you're just jealous, old cat.

13:08.162 --> 13:11.874
Yes, please, Luci, go bother
Stan in the dungeon or something.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.877
Prince Scruffles,
tell us about this crown you lost.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.631
Well, it had jewels
and, you know, cat stuff. [laughs]

13:19.340 --> 13:21.967
Like, scram, nose-job. He's my chump now.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.888
Yeah, Luci,
I'm his chump now. Get outta here!

13:25.971 --> 13:29.391
[grunts] Stupid cat. I used to be
the most annoying guy around here.

13:41.695 --> 13:42.738
[sighs]

13:43.822 --> 13:46.617
Wow! This malnutrition is really slimming.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.586
Beat it, peewee.
The kiddie rides are that way.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.338
End of the pier and keep walkin'.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.552
[gasps] Elfo!

14:05.594 --> 14:07.221
Edith. [chuckles]

14:07.304 --> 14:10.683
You're even more beautiful,
and bejeweled, than I imagined.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.643
And you're taller than I imagined.

14:12.726 --> 14:15.563
Full disclosure,
I am standing on two stools.

14:15.646 --> 14:19.316
Oh, my God, you're out of your cage.
Why don't you just leave?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.694
I'm not getting out of here without you.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.362
Oh, Elfo, that's crazy.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.697
No, it's not.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.574
See that grocery bag over there?

14:26.657 --> 14:29.410
I'll punch holes in it
so you can see where we're going.

14:29.493 --> 14:32.746
We'll roam the countryside,
performing for farmers by day,

14:32.830 --> 14:35.207
stealing their eggs by night. I can dance.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.544
I can play the harmonica,
if you hold it up to my mouth and move it.

14:38.627 --> 14:39.712
It'll be paradise,

14:39.795 --> 14:40.963
if you like raw eggs.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.799
Oh, my God, enough
with the romantic fantasies.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.551
You'll be
at each other's throats in a week.

14:45.634 --> 14:48.012
[scoffs] She doesn't even have a throat.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.346
-[yelps]
-Gotcha!

14:50.848 --> 14:53.601
I like your little jig.
We'll add it to the act.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.102
Now get your beauty sleep.

14:55.185 --> 14:58.230
I'll be back tomorrow
for the 5:00 a.m. hose down.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.615
This can't be my fate, can it?
Please, Edith, show me a card.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.075
Oh, Elfo. Just one.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.704
"Desire."

15:14.371 --> 15:16.332
Look, Edith, the card said so!

15:16.415 --> 15:19.585
Oh, Elfo, that could be love
or lemon meringue pie.

15:19.668 --> 15:22.004
-What's the difference?
-[laughs]

15:22.087 --> 15:24.590
Ugh. I wish I could drown.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.134
[brakes squeal]

15:27.217 --> 15:28.135
Why did we stop?

15:28.218 --> 15:31.388
We've been driving for hours
and you haven't offered me a drink,

15:31.472 --> 15:33.349
so I'm gettin' one myself.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.977
-You're kinda slow on the uptake, Bean.
-Hey, I understand drinks.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.980
Oh, my God, it's the same logo
that was on Elfo's pin!

15:43.025 --> 15:45.653
Bup, bup, bup. Members only. Sorry, madam.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.739
I'm in no mood, Pierre.
I'm assuming your name is Pierre.

15:48.822 --> 15:52.493
I rode around all day on a metal horse
with a lady that talks in riddles.

15:52.576 --> 15:55.329
Oh, Lady Bowmore, welcome back!

15:55.412 --> 15:58.082
Excuse me while I dispose of this trash.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.001
Not necessary. That hot trash is with me.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.339
Here's your usual.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.099
So it's agreed. I'll take
possession of the elf immediately.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.517
[gasps] Elfo?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.978
Be warned, he's not one of the cute ones.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.229
[gasps] Elfo!

16:21.689 --> 16:22.690
[both snicker]

16:27.152 --> 16:28.153
[Bean] Ow!

16:31.407 --> 16:32.282
[gasps]

16:35.327 --> 16:36.704
[breathing heavily]

16:40.124 --> 16:42.001
[groans] So many stairs.

16:44.712 --> 16:45.713
[sighs]

16:50.718 --> 16:51.719
[exclaims]

16:54.304 --> 16:55.472
[grunting]

17:01.562 --> 17:04.314
I will never find
that boot again. [groaning]

17:10.571 --> 17:11.488
[sighs]

17:12.406 --> 17:15.075
Please, I've got to know
the rest of our destiny.

17:15.159 --> 17:15.993
Two more cards.

17:16.076 --> 17:19.038
Careful. You've gone
from non-believer to fate junkie.

17:19.121 --> 17:22.791
The cards, come on.
Give me some of that sweet predestination.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.043
Okay.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.629
"Devotion." Ooh. That's a good one.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.091
See? We're meant to be! And two Ds?

17:31.633 --> 17:33.594
It's gotta be! Next card.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.429
Come on, "Dinner Date."

17:36.930 --> 17:39.266
"Decapitation"? [chuckles nervously]

17:39.349 --> 17:42.853
Wait, it's you! You're just a head.

17:42.936 --> 17:45.189
That's three Ds.
That's gotta mean something!

17:45.272 --> 17:47.941
-Listen, I dig you--
-[Elfo] Another D.

17:48.025 --> 17:51.153
I'm feeling things down below
and I don't even have a down below.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.781
But tempting fate like this? It's risky.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.742
Love is risky!
That's what makes it so great.

17:56.825 --> 17:57.993
When it pays off!

17:58.077 --> 18:00.829
And at a quarter a pop,
you're very affordable.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.789
Three more cards.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.959
Where did you get all those coins?

18:06.043 --> 18:09.254
Oh. The hicks throw 'em
at my head when I do somersaults.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.548
Now let's see our future.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.977
I'll show Zøg and that stupid cat.
Nobody messes with my evil plans.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.521
Shiyoo-yoo!

18:36.657 --> 18:38.951
You ever had a, uh, Scruffles sandwich?

18:39.535 --> 18:41.120
[muttering]

18:44.456 --> 18:47.960
No, let me out of the coffin.
I'll be good.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.129
Don't make me talk to Elfo.
[continues muttering]

18:51.213 --> 18:53.173
[Luci] Zøg, buddy, wake up.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.008
-[growls]
-[yelps]

18:55.092 --> 18:57.553
[grunts] Oh, it's you, kitty-cat.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.263
[grunts]

18:59.346 --> 19:01.431
You were having a nightmare. A bad one.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.476
-All I have is nightmares now.
-That's rough, I tells ya.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.603
When I wake up, it's even worse.

19:06.687 --> 19:10.065
In those brief moments
between sleep and wakefulness,

19:10.149 --> 19:13.110
I realize who I am
and what's happening to me.

19:13.193 --> 19:16.738
Kitty-cat, I'm going crazy. [whimpers]

19:17.281 --> 19:20.367
Aw, come here, you fat-ass lunatic.

19:20.450 --> 19:23.912
[kisses] Give me a kiss.
It's gonna be okay. Okay, bubbeleh?

19:24.746 --> 19:28.876
[singing] ♪ Rock-a-bye, Zøggy
In the treetops ♪

19:28.959 --> 19:33.005

19:56.028 --> 19:58.363
[Bean gasps] Elfo!

19:58.447 --> 20:00.407
I gotta drop down quietly.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.160
-[bell dings]
-[steam whistle blows]

20:07.748 --> 20:09.833
Come on, deal the cards.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.753
-"Disruption"?
-[yells]

20:12.836 --> 20:14.296
-Bean!
-Elfo!

20:16.840 --> 20:19.885
Are you okay?
You look so much sadder than your poster.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.221
-I have a poster?
-Here, stick your foot out.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.014
No, your other foot.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.433
-[metal clanks]
-[Elfo] Ow!

20:27.142 --> 20:28.477
Ow! Ow!

20:28.560 --> 20:30.437
-Goddamn you.
-Let's go!

20:30.520 --> 20:32.981
[all] Save us! Save us! Save us!

20:33.065 --> 20:36.693
Okay, fine, but my arms are really tired.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.446
I've been hanging off
a blimp for, like, a while.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.159
[barks]

20:50.374 --> 20:51.792
[all cheering]

20:55.212 --> 20:56.255
Elfo, don't!

20:56.338 --> 20:58.799
[P.T.] That's right, Elfo, don't.

20:58.882 --> 21:02.719
How do you wanna die?
Slowly or extra slowly?

21:02.803 --> 21:05.722
Extra slowly. Wait-- [gasps]

21:05.806 --> 21:06.974
Elfo!

21:07.057 --> 21:08.392
[Elfo choking]

21:15.023 --> 21:16.024
[gasping]

21:18.360 --> 21:19.444
[Elfo] What?

21:20.862 --> 21:23.824
Oh, my God, Edith! You have a body!

21:23.907 --> 21:26.243
Now it'll be even easier
to run away together.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.953
Do you know what this means?

21:28.036 --> 21:30.872
We're one step away
from happily ever after.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.750
No, Elfo, I can't. I'm cursed.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.628
Anyone who falls in love with me
meets a horrible fate.

21:36.712 --> 21:41.008
Decapitation isn't about me.
It's about you. Those were your cards.

21:41.091 --> 21:44.428
Then do three more cards.
About us. About our future.

21:44.511 --> 21:47.597
-"Doom. Despair." And "Death."
-"Doom. Despair. Death."

21:47.681 --> 21:50.017
[Edith] Ooh, that's the worst
three cards I've ever dealt.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.269
That's not good. Try another three.

21:52.352 --> 21:55.897
-"Dread. Dismay. Damnation."
-"Dread. Dismay." And "Damnation."

21:55.981 --> 21:58.525
-[Edith] Ooh, that's even worse.
-Jeez, a lot of Ds.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.861
-Did you shuffle the deck?
-Elfo, look.

22:00.944 --> 22:05.365
"Devastation, Danger, Destruction,
Darkness, Dummy, Disenchantment,

22:05.449 --> 22:07.617
Deception, Deliciousness, Distress…"

22:07.701 --> 22:10.537
Wait. Go back.
"Deliciousness." There's hope!

22:10.620 --> 22:13.332
I am pretty good with a deep-fryer,
but it's not worth it.

22:14.541 --> 22:15.584
Goodbye, Elfo.

-[Bean grunts]

22:22.132 --> 22:25.927

except you, Elfo. Let's go.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.513
Okay, just, please give me a second.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.182
Goodbye, Edith.

[gasps] No, Edith! Where did she go?

23:14.351 --> 23:15.393
[Bean] Oh, no.

23:16.311 --> 23:18.939
This is all
because Alva's after the magic.
