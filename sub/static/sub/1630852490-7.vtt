00:53.580 --> 00:54.750
Doesn't Troy

00:55.120 --> 00:56.720
know that Elle left our team?

00:57.050 --> 00:58.050
He knows.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.160
Then he has no intention of doing it!

01:02.590 --> 01:05.590
Even if she were here, she'd never go see him.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.930
So Troy's target

01:09.160 --> 01:10.370
was Elle.

01:16.370 --> 01:18.170
It's not certain.

01:18.170 --> 01:20.110
We have to hear what Troy has to say.

01:20.110 --> 01:21.310
I asked.

01:21.780 --> 01:23.010
He said he didn't do it.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.320
All the songs he referenced are unknown.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.220
We only know them because we hang out with him.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.850
Are you serious?

01:30.850 --> 01:33.450
He suffered so much as an idol trainee.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.360
He's now just getting settled.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.390
Stella!

01:37.160 --> 01:39.289
Did we get here on a golden horse?

01:40.630 --> 01:41.630
No.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.630
Get a grip.

01:43.630 --> 01:45.600
Are you preparing for a school talent show?

01:55.840 --> 01:57.150
I'll change the song.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.610
I heard all the other songs.

01:58.610 --> 01:59.850
You copied all of them.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.260
No, I didn't!

02:01.750 --> 02:02.750
You did.

02:03.850 --> 02:05.220
Then I'll write a new song.

02:07.020 --> 02:08.259
In such a short time?

02:08.560 --> 02:09.750
Are you a genius?

02:09.930 --> 02:11.730
If you could do it, why copy?

02:12.590 --> 02:13.560
Give me some time...

02:13.560 --> 02:15.600
All the other songs are ready.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.230
We left your track open.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.570
Because of you. We trusted you.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.040
But

02:21.570 --> 02:22.800
you want us to wait more?

02:23.640 --> 02:26.140
You know my situation.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.980
If we get delayed even more, I'm going to die!

02:30.810 --> 02:31.810
Elle...

02:35.480 --> 02:37.650
I didn't know Elle would go that far.

02:39.050 --> 02:40.920
She was the closest to him.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.590
To be honest,

02:42.590 --> 02:44.230
I was a bit worried

02:44.230 --> 02:46.829
that Elle would take a step back.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.530
What do we do now?

02:49.700 --> 02:51.570
Seriously...

02:54.100 --> 02:56.100
It's easier to go back to Bbiyong.

02:59.310 --> 03:00.990
I'll go talk to Elle!

03:01.210 --> 03:02.640
I'll tell her to take responsibility

03:02.640 --> 03:04.510
because it's her fault Troy is being like this.

03:04.510 --> 03:05.980
Let's pin it on her!

03:08.080 --> 03:09.050
I'll go.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.620
I'll persuade her.

03:12.190 --> 03:13.190
No.

03:15.590 --> 03:16.829
I'll go.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.840
You disgust me.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.180
You really disgust me!

03:33.180 --> 03:35.340
I don't ever want to see you again.

03:37.180 --> 03:40.250
My heart unbearably

03:40.250 --> 03:41.720
You have to loosen up more here.

03:41.850 --> 03:44.690
"It hurts," this part should be a half falsetto.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.790
The beautiful days

03:47.790 --> 03:49.260
Don't drag out the last note here.

03:49.260 --> 03:49.960
Okay.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.930
Why are you so scared on the high notes?

03:51.930 --> 03:52.590
In high notes,

03:52.590 --> 03:53.700
there's an inward sound

03:53.700 --> 03:55.000
and an outward sound.

03:55.930 --> 03:58.070
My heart

03:58.270 --> 04:00.440
My heart

04:00.740 --> 04:02.040
- It's different, right?
- Yes.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.670
The key is how you breathe.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.610
- And here...
- Ms. Kang!

04:06.840 --> 04:08.310
Time's up.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.310
I'm going to an internet café with a friend.

04:10.310 --> 04:11.750
See you next week!

04:17.019 --> 04:18.620
Did you forget something?

04:19.220 --> 04:20.790
I went to the studio.

04:21.490 --> 04:23.170
They said you were here.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.970
I'm really sick and tired of you.

04:39.270 --> 04:41.409
How could you go to Troy?

04:41.580 --> 04:42.780
How can you

04:44.450 --> 04:46.110
ask me to plead with him?

04:47.450 --> 04:49.780
Did you come to me thinking I'd go?

04:51.720 --> 04:53.159
Then you're crazy.

04:54.020 --> 04:55.400
I now realize...

04:56.060 --> 04:58.330
I should've been crazy sooner.

05:00.230 --> 05:02.000
We're doing great.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.530
We're going to do a show with Mars, too.

05:06.270 --> 05:07.600
But Elle...

05:09.600 --> 05:11.640
We can't do it without you.

05:13.110 --> 05:14.440
Not one of use

05:15.340 --> 05:17.550
can get used to you not being there.

05:21.080 --> 05:21.750
Stop it.

05:21.750 --> 05:22.880
Come back.

05:23.620 --> 05:24.190
Let's do this together.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.620
It's already over!

05:25.620 --> 05:27.220
You're not happy like this!

05:27.220 --> 05:29.220
I didn't leave to be happy!

05:30.590 --> 05:32.390
I left to be less unhappy.

05:33.860 --> 05:35.900
If my unhappiness had a face,

05:38.600 --> 05:40.280
it would be all of you.

05:45.270 --> 05:46.840
Let's stop doing this.

05:47.909 --> 05:49.850
You said you didn't have the luxury to stop me.

05:50.380 --> 05:51.810
Remember how you felt then.

05:54.650 --> 05:55.950
Stop coming to see me.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.300
Part 7
Elle

06:08.660 --> 06:09.760
I'm Jenna.

06:09.900 --> 06:10.900
I'm Elle.

06:12.930 --> 06:13.930
I know.

06:15.370 --> 06:16.370
You do?

06:16.940 --> 06:17.910
Why?

06:18.610 --> 06:19.670
What do you mean, "why"?

06:22.010 --> 06:23.710
I don't know what they said about me...

06:23.710 --> 06:25.680
I searched and listened to all your songs.

06:25.850 --> 06:27.380
Even your cover songs.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.920
I love the tone of your voice.

06:32.650 --> 06:34.020
What's there to love?

06:34.020 --> 06:34.920
It's like

06:35.360 --> 06:36.930
a red cockscomb

06:37.190 --> 06:38.870
blooming by the railroad.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.500
What?

06:41.500 --> 06:44.270
Or like a rusty nail dumped in the grass.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.500
It's ominous and uneasy.

06:47.670 --> 06:49.240
It makes me tense up.

06:50.270 --> 06:51.950
But then it comforts me.

06:53.140 --> 06:54.740
That dissonance...

06:54.740 --> 06:55.980
I love it.

06:59.580 --> 07:00.550
Whatever.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.550
You're weird.

07:08.660 --> 07:09.660
Hey!

07:33.480 --> 07:35.220
I knew it.

07:39.690 --> 07:40.390
Okay.

07:40.390 --> 07:43.120
I'm the chief choreographer of Cotton Candy.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.460
You can count on me.

07:44.860 --> 07:47.300
Into my small world

07:47.300 --> 07:49.500
You came like a big gift

07:49.500 --> 07:51.200
In a sparkling moment

07:51.200 --> 07:54.970
My white first love came to me

08:02.710 --> 08:03.910
Have some porridge.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.400
Is she okay?

08:22.860 --> 08:24.400
Her forehead is on fire.

08:28.470 --> 08:30.040
I'm okay, so leave.

08:47.620 --> 08:48.690
What's wrong?

08:49.090 --> 08:50.230
What happened?

08:50.230 --> 08:52.390
We met KillA by chance.

08:52.390 --> 08:53.600
They kept saying bad things about you.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.260
Hyun-ji demanded an apology and got into a fight.

08:55.260 --> 08:56.600
Why did you do that?

08:56.600 --> 08:59.200
I won't let them trash-talk about you!

09:32.600 --> 09:35.000
We succeeded after you left us.

09:35.770 --> 09:37.440
I think your bad energy

09:37.570 --> 09:39.370
was blocking our luck.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.010
That's my guess.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.110
Anyway, do your best.

09:51.190 --> 09:56.490
I can take you higher

09:56.490 --> 10:00.930
The ninth big cloud over there

10:00.930 --> 10:02.700
Let's do this part again.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.400
I can take you higher

10:04.400 --> 10:06.170
Let's count it down.

10:06.540 --> 10:09.370
Five, six, seven, eight!

10:09.370 --> 10:11.640
I can take you higher

10:22.980 --> 10:24.150
Thank you.

10:34.630 --> 10:35.730
What's this?

10:35.730 --> 10:37.570
Do you still have a cold?

10:37.570 --> 10:38.430
Huh?

10:38.430 --> 10:39.430
Yeah.

10:40.970 --> 10:43.540
Why don't you go see a new doctor?

10:43.540 --> 10:45.170
The show is in a few days.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.680
You don't want to do the collab, right?

10:54.520 --> 10:56.050
You don't have to be so obvious.

10:56.050 --> 10:57.790
You're making everyone uncomfortable.

10:57.790 --> 10:58.850
Hey!

10:58.850 --> 11:00.370
Just say thank you.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.460
Is it so hard to say that?

11:06.190 --> 11:08.500
Does a rich family need

11:08.500 --> 11:11.470
to receive gratitude from a poor family?

11:12.130 --> 11:13.570
Failing doesn't make you entitled.

11:13.570 --> 11:15.040
Stop being so arrogant.

11:20.340 --> 11:22.940
He's totally Cha Jae-hyuk Jr.

11:23.340 --> 11:25.110
Seriously.

11:38.730 --> 11:39.660
I don't...

11:40.100 --> 11:41.860
want my team to worry.

11:43.630 --> 11:45.530
I have no intention of interfering.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.570
But you're supposed to take that after a meal.

11:49.140 --> 11:49.800
In this biz,

11:49.800 --> 11:52.140
managing mental health is no big deal.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.320
Stop following me!

12:02.550 --> 12:03.790
It's been days!

12:04.850 --> 12:06.020
Do you have that much free time?

12:06.020 --> 12:07.120
Let's talk.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.660
Hey, idol!

12:13.660 --> 12:14.800
You're coming home?

12:16.430 --> 12:17.310
If you haven't eaten,

12:17.310 --> 12:18.640
let's go to a convenience store.

12:18.670 --> 12:21.100
I was going to get gimbap.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.500
Forget it.

12:25.110 --> 12:27.840
You look like you could fall over.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.610
I'm just trying to help you.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.280
Hey!

12:34.650 --> 12:37.050
If you keep acting like this, I'll get angry!

12:37.050 --> 12:39.350
You're making it look like I'm pestering you.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.160
I'm just giving you advice

12:41.160 --> 12:42.990
as a life coach.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.150
You shouldn't live like that.

12:45.330 --> 12:47.230
He's as old as your uncle.

12:47.930 --> 12:48.560
What?

12:48.560 --> 12:50.130
I'm talking about that expensive car!

12:50.130 --> 12:52.570
The man who drove you home the other day.

12:52.570 --> 12:54.900
I know you're in a difficult situation right now.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.800
But you can't just give up on life like that.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.210
Look at the big picture.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.710
It's clear he's married.

12:59.710 --> 13:02.510
Since you're a celebrity now,

13:02.510 --> 13:03.310
he's just trying to...

13:03.310 --> 13:04.280
Hey!

13:05.910 --> 13:06.380
Let go!

13:06.380 --> 13:07.250
What the?

13:12.390 --> 13:13.560
Jenna!

13:15.690 --> 13:16.520
Jenna.

13:16.660 --> 13:17.730
Are you alright?

13:18.160 --> 13:19.190
- I'm sorry.
- Get up.

13:19.190 --> 13:20.300
Are you okay?

13:20.700 --> 13:22.830
So why did you butt in?

13:23.230 --> 13:24.370
Try to get up.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.200
You bastard!

13:29.640 --> 13:31.040
You trash.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.580
If you don't get lost, I'm going to kill you.

13:38.980 --> 13:40.280
Let go!

13:40.750 --> 13:42.620
Let's go home, huh?

13:42.980 --> 13:44.120
You can't stay here.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.620
How many times must I tell you?

13:49.990 --> 13:51.890
Jenna. Please.

13:52.130 --> 13:53.800
I'm begging you.

13:55.730 --> 13:57.530
Why are you begging me?

13:57.800 --> 13:59.900
Why are you being so unreasonable?

14:00.270 --> 14:01.870
You want to go home, too, right?

14:01.870 --> 14:04.010
- You're putting up a front!
- That's right!

14:04.870 --> 14:06.210
I want to go home!

14:07.380 --> 14:09.810
That's why I'm doing this.

14:15.780 --> 14:18.290
How can you do this when I left like that?

14:18.890 --> 14:19.920
A front?

14:20.620 --> 14:21.660
You're right.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.260
So just leave me alone.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.400
If you don't,

14:27.900 --> 14:30.270
that front will become real.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.190
What do I have to do?

14:54.390 --> 14:57.030
What do I have to do, you jerk?

15:17.780 --> 15:18.850
(Don't come inside.)

15:29.390 --> 15:30.430
Troy...

15:31.090 --> 15:32.130
He'll do it.

15:32.630 --> 15:33.630
Elle...

15:34.600 --> 15:36.660
I did my part.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.630
My debt is settled now.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.370
I also felt bad leaving like that.

15:46.670 --> 15:48.610
Now, focus on going your way.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.150
You can't go back to that study room.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.650
I'll fight my own battles.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.620
Good luck.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.630
Hey.

16:11.530 --> 16:13.100
Bring your song tomorrow.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.140
I'll work on it.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.370
What did you want from Elle?

16:17.640 --> 16:18.870
What do you think?

16:19.410 --> 16:21.010
A heartfelt apology.

16:24.610 --> 16:26.650
Do you have to do this now?

16:27.350 --> 16:30.280
You didn't have the guts to call me for 5 years.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.220
I thought you'd come

16:32.620 --> 16:33.890
and ask for forgiveness.

16:33.890 --> 16:34.990
Forgiveness?

16:35.860 --> 16:36.960
Why would I?

16:37.090 --> 16:39.960
There's nothing wrong with calling out plagiarism!

16:39.960 --> 16:41.800
I said I didn't plagiarize!

16:44.330 --> 16:46.000
You still have a long way to go.

16:48.970 --> 16:51.010
You're just as you were 5 years ago.

16:51.710 --> 16:52.870
What about you?

16:53.510 --> 16:55.780
How much did you change? Huh?

16:56.510 --> 16:57.780
You stab people in the back and

16:57.780 --> 16:59.810
switch teams when things get rough!

17:00.280 --> 17:01.280
What?

17:03.150 --> 17:05.349
Before you stabbed me in the back and cut me off,

17:05.349 --> 17:08.890
you should've thought how you got into the team.

17:09.490 --> 17:11.089
Even if you disregard our friendship,

17:11.089 --> 17:12.790
for that, you shouldn't have done that to me!

17:12.790 --> 17:13.859
Why?

17:18.230 --> 17:19.630
Because we dreamt the same dream.

17:19.630 --> 17:21.040
You're the one who destroyed that!

17:21.040 --> 17:22.540
Why?

17:24.670 --> 17:26.369
If you were in the same situation,

17:26.369 --> 17:28.540
I would've been on your side.

17:28.540 --> 17:31.080
A thousand times over, I'd be on your side!

17:33.410 --> 17:35.580
Enough. Just tell me what you want.

17:37.150 --> 17:38.850
I want you to suffer

17:40.620 --> 17:43.620
as much as I suffered.

17:52.930 --> 17:53.900
So?

18:04.780 --> 18:07.010
Everyone looks at me

18:07.010 --> 18:09.850
Me me me me

18:10.450 --> 18:12.650
Everyone looks at me

18:12.650 --> 18:15.120
Me me me me

18:22.000 --> 18:23.200
You're here.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.590
Why is such a young person in such bad shape?

19:25.590 --> 19:27.530
Your meridian system is all blocked.

19:27.530 --> 19:28.600
At this rate,

19:28.600 --> 19:31.570
you won't be able to sing or dance.

19:37.170 --> 19:39.300
Stay here for a few more minutes.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.470
Okay.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.990
She hasn't broken or sprained any bones.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.520
That's not the problem.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.990
She'll collapse soon.

19:57.490 --> 19:58.690
How

19:58.790 --> 20:00.730
can a company that says its singers are its asset

20:00.730 --> 20:03.260
not take care of their health?

20:04.100 --> 20:06.130
I don't know how she's holding on.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.340
Of course.

20:07.470 --> 20:08.970
The CEO

20:09.040 --> 20:11.570
has no sympathy at all.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.970
It's been a long time, but it doesn't seem like it.

20:13.970 --> 20:15.080
You're the same.

20:16.380 --> 20:17.380
Of course.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.180
I'm upset with you.

20:18.180 --> 20:19.510
- Still?
- Yes.

20:19.910 --> 20:22.720
You separated my brother from his true love.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.220
Not that again...

20:24.450 --> 20:25.550
True Love Oriental Medicine Clinic

20:27.620 --> 20:28.420
Wait.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.720
He isn't the only pitiful one. What about me?

20:30.720 --> 20:33.030
It's excessive to call her his true love.

20:33.030 --> 20:34.930
You're a third party.

20:34.930 --> 20:37.200
I wondered why I had no sympathy.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.370
I take after you.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.470
Is my brother's true love's son doing well?

20:42.470 --> 20:43.470
Wow...

20:43.770 --> 20:46.040
I don't want to go there.

20:46.140 --> 20:49.540
Right. I could see he's doing extremely well.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.250
He's a lot more famous than you.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.880
Google him.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.480
There are 1,000 times more articles about him

20:54.480 --> 20:56.350
than you.

20:56.350 --> 20:58.490
He's a proud treasure of Korea.

21:01.420 --> 21:03.190
Why'd you come to Korea?

21:03.620 --> 21:06.390
You said you didn't care because you're American.

21:09.100 --> 21:14.170
The best thing your dad did was teach you Korean.

21:14.170 --> 21:15.170
Seriously,..

21:15.570 --> 21:17.340
You got beaten up so bad.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.010
Whenever you got beaten after holding out,

21:22.210 --> 21:24.250
it was so satisfying.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.450
I'm American...

21:29.250 --> 21:31.450
Turn off the lights and lock up before you go.

21:32.420 --> 21:33.950
I'll prepare herbal medicine.

21:33.950 --> 21:35.600
Write down your address.

21:35.620 --> 21:36.620
Okay.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.990
How can you call me when I was almost home?

21:41.730 --> 21:43.100
I'm hungry!

21:51.170 --> 21:52.310
Thank you.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.740
Enjoy.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.580
She's the daughter of my late mom's

22:00.580 --> 22:02.520
only husband's parents.

22:01.010 --> 22:03.240
Parents / Mom / Husband / Daughter

22:04.390 --> 22:05.350
Your aunt?

22:05.350 --> 22:07.920
She told me to call her that instead of "aunt."

22:08.020 --> 22:09.990
She's very upset with me.

22:10.490 --> 22:13.130
Illegal stay, immigrants, identity, racial issues,

22:13.130 --> 22:15.060
romance, family, love-hate relationship, etc.

22:15.060 --> 22:17.200
It's an interesting family narrative,

22:17.570 --> 22:20.530
but we're not close enough to share that.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.940
Why did you fall down the stairs?

22:24.370 --> 22:25.540
No reason.

22:26.210 --> 22:27.210
No reason?

22:32.680 --> 22:35.280
I didn't know falling down the stairs was a hobby.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.950
That's unprofessional when you have a show soon.

22:38.050 --> 22:40.390
What if you had broken a bone?

22:42.620 --> 22:43.820
I'm sorry.

22:45.660 --> 22:47.190
Did you get a producer?

22:47.660 --> 22:48.530
Yes.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.070
Who?

22:52.330 --> 22:53.330
Troy.

22:53.370 --> 22:56.400
The one who won the Asian Artist Awards?

22:57.440 --> 22:58.440
Yes.

23:00.770 --> 23:03.480
He lost an award and a project.

23:04.380 --> 23:06.350
Executive Bong must be livid.

23:20.460 --> 23:22.430
Don't let this happen again.

23:22.660 --> 23:25.070
As long as you have your name with Starpeace.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.030
Yes, Sir.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.670
Thank you

23:30.040 --> 23:31.010
for today.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.540
This is a ceasefire, not the end of war.

23:33.540 --> 23:35.080
Just until Mars's show.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.340
Of course, if things take a turn,

23:36.340 --> 23:38.310
the ceasefire might end before that.

23:39.050 --> 23:40.780
What happened with Bbiyong...

23:41.880 --> 23:43.180
I misunderstood

23:43.420 --> 23:45.350
and was rude to you. I'm sorry.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.420
Don't be.

23:49.420 --> 23:51.990
Your misunderstanding was better for the agency.

23:53.190 --> 23:54.160
Get out.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.160
Okay.

23:56.360 --> 23:57.670
Thank you.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.450
I can't believe Elle went there.

24:15.450 --> 24:16.580
She apologized?

24:16.580 --> 24:17.750
Elle?

24:19.050 --> 24:21.060
Is Elle really never coming back?

24:21.490 --> 24:22.690
I think she's

24:23.160 --> 24:25.890
trying to cut us off by doing this.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.300
Did she hate us that much?

24:31.700 --> 24:34.270
What a waste of 7 years!

24:34.270 --> 24:35.470
Unbelievable.

24:35.900 --> 24:37.740
Seems like something happened between them.

24:37.740 --> 24:38.810
But they won't say.

24:39.740 --> 24:40.240
I'm worried.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.440
Don't bother.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.120
She'll take care of it.

24:43.340 --> 24:44.650
You just

24:44.650 --> 24:46.210
focus on your duet with Ji-han.

24:46.210 --> 24:47.410
Are you still talking about that?

24:47.410 --> 24:48.410
Jenna.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.520
Director Yoon okayed it.

24:50.620 --> 24:51.550
What?

24:51.820 --> 24:53.520
Job listing & Recruitment
Employment Information

24:52.520 --> 24:53.590
It seems like...

24:53.590 --> 24:56.120
he's given up on everything.

24:56.690 --> 24:59.590
Entertainment Team looking for candidate with experience
Popular Culture Development Team wants talent with experience

24:57.320 --> 24:59.390
He was searching through job listings today again.

25:01.610 --> 25:03.400
Music, cue!

25:15.410 --> 25:17.210
Stop! Stop! Stop!

25:19.850 --> 25:21.450
What's with you two?

25:22.880 --> 25:23.950
I thought

25:23.950 --> 25:26.590
you were blocks of wood doing Tetris.

25:26.590 --> 25:27.560
Jenna!

25:27.560 --> 25:29.760
Make your gaze sexier.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.190
Ji-han!

25:31.190 --> 25:32.560
Get closer to her!

25:32.560 --> 25:33.560
Got it?

25:33.560 --> 25:34.730
Do it again.

25:34.730 --> 25:36.330
We'll be watching.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.570
What is up with you two?

25:38.570 --> 25:41.000
Start the music!

25:48.540 --> 25:50.410
- Come on!
- Seriously!

25:52.480 --> 25:54.310
Get closer! Get closer!

25:54.310 --> 25:56.020
- Get closer!
- Get closer!

25:58.350 --> 25:59.590
Expression! Expression!

25:59.590 --> 26:01.220
- Control your expression!
- Jenna...

26:06.730 --> 26:07.900
What are you doing, Jenna?

26:07.900 --> 26:10.100
Wait! Stop! Stop!

26:11.270 --> 26:12.700
Are you kidding me?

26:13.400 --> 26:14.840
Are you kidding?

26:14.840 --> 26:17.170
The show is in two days!

26:17.170 --> 26:19.140
You're hurting my feelings.

26:19.140 --> 26:20.470
Mine, too!

26:33.450 --> 26:34.760
I see what you want.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.790
First...

26:35.790 --> 26:38.490
It's dangerous to change the team concept.

26:38.860 --> 26:40.360
But it's a good choice.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.900
The roles given to each member in the first album

26:42.900 --> 26:44.970
was playing it too safe and a bit forced.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.800
You guys practiced a lot, so you did well.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.600
But it had no appeal.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.410
Chae-ah and Stella both have sweet voices,

26:53.410 --> 26:54.610
but they're a bit different.

26:55.310 --> 26:57.510
Chae-ah's is bright and cheerful.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.410
Stella's is warm and tender.

26:59.410 --> 27:02.780
But they were mechanically lumped up together.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.590
So your team's tone became monotonous.

27:05.920 --> 27:06.950
But

27:06.950 --> 27:08.920
what divides them

27:09.190 --> 27:10.420
is your voice.

27:11.390 --> 27:14.830
It subtly goes between them, dividing them.

27:15.930 --> 27:17.370
But that only goes

27:17.630 --> 27:19.000
so far.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.240
What?

27:24.070 --> 27:25.370
What's that look?

27:25.940 --> 27:26.940
Well.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.140
It seems like

27:29.380 --> 27:31.210
you know us so well.

27:32.010 --> 27:32.950
Oh, I...

27:32.950 --> 27:34.750
I don't know you that well.

27:37.020 --> 27:38.120
But what

27:39.290 --> 27:42.560
instills primeval force into this smooth picture

27:42.560 --> 27:43.560
is Elle.

27:44.530 --> 27:45.730
Life.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.900
When Elle's voice comes in, you tense up.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.230
Elle's middle to low register,

27:52.370 --> 27:54.700
unique huskiness, nasal sound

27:54.700 --> 27:56.140
and falsetto.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.410
She regulates all of that exquisitely.

27:58.410 --> 27:59.970
Her voice scratches your heart

27:59.970 --> 28:01.280
pats it with comfort,

28:01.280 --> 28:02.680
then slaps you in the face.

28:03.340 --> 28:06.050
She knows how to control people's emotions.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.750
The part where people feel pathos

28:10.250 --> 28:11.690
is in Elle's part.

28:22.430 --> 28:23.900
I look forward to the results.

28:30.970 --> 28:31.970
By the way,

28:33.040 --> 28:35.680
did something happen between you and Elle?

28:36.780 --> 28:37.780
What?

28:38.450 --> 28:39.610
That day.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.280
It seemed like

28:41.280 --> 28:42.980
there was something between you two.

28:47.350 --> 28:52.330
I'll make a new world

28:52.530 --> 28:53.890
Now follow me

28:53.890 --> 28:55.260
Everyone looks at me

28:55.260 --> 28:57.130
Me me me me

28:57.630 --> 28:59.000
Everyone looks at me

28:59.000 --> 29:01.030
Me me me me

29:01.440 --> 29:02.770
Everyone looks at me

29:02.770 --> 29:04.740
Me me me me

29:05.140 --> 29:06.470
Everyone looks at me

29:06.470 --> 29:08.440
Me me me me

29:09.140 --> 29:11.750
I won't be stuck in your frame

29:11.750 --> 29:13.650
My standard of happiness is me

29:13.650 --> 29:16.420
Follow me if you can

29:16.420 --> 29:19.250
I won't put my life on the line for love

29:19.250 --> 29:21.090
It's a waste of time

29:21.090 --> 29:24.220
Follow me if you want

29:24.220 --> 29:25.860
I'm different, baby

29:25.860 --> 29:27.690
See how different we are

29:27.690 --> 29:29.560
I have so much charm, daily

29:29.560 --> 29:30.760
Everyone is...

29:37.440 --> 29:38.440
Thanks.

29:38.810 --> 29:40.740
This is from the coffee shop across the street?

29:41.410 --> 29:43.610
It tastes different.

29:44.810 --> 29:45.750
You know her, right?

29:45.950 --> 29:47.950
She's Romy, your replacement.

29:48.350 --> 29:50.250
She does so well

29:50.250 --> 29:52.050
that our team got stronger.

29:53.050 --> 29:55.020
Why did you come so early?

29:55.090 --> 29:56.890
All there is to do is run errands.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.690
You told me to come at 3 PM.

29:58.690 --> 29:59.690
I did?

29:59.990 --> 30:01.760
Didn't I say 4 PM?

30:01.930 --> 30:04.160
Sorry. I guess I made a mistake.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.800
Then I'll come back at 4 PM.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.510
It's almost 4. Going back and forth is a hassle.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.580
Let's chat till the dance team gets here.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.640
It's been a long time.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.210
We're not exactly friends.

30:20.650 --> 30:22.650
I'm curious about something.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.920
If not for Troy, we wouldn't have accepted you.

30:27.320 --> 30:28.790
What do you want to know?

30:29.690 --> 30:31.230
Since you left Cotton Candy,

30:32.060 --> 30:33.860
where are you going to go this time?

30:34.600 --> 30:36.830
What team is making their debut soon?

30:37.300 --> 30:39.830
Elle's too old now, so she can't join.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.000
Their average age is 19.

30:43.700 --> 30:44.940
Anyway, it wasn't easy

30:44.940 --> 30:46.940
for us to accept you.

30:47.270 --> 30:48.610
So do your best.

30:49.210 --> 30:50.210
Alright?

30:56.550 --> 30:57.880
Are you free now?

30:58.550 --> 31:00.750
If you are, come to the studio.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.050
Seo Ji-han

31:46.000 --> 31:47.630
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

31:47.630 --> 31:49.670
You're not this bad at dancing.

31:50.670 --> 31:52.710
I understand I make you uncomfortable.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.810
But you should switch that off when you work.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.290
You said you'll do anything if it's not illegal.

32:07.150 --> 32:08.270
Isn't that why

32:10.190 --> 32:12.960
you could easily use other people?

32:16.400 --> 32:18.170
If you're getting faint-hearted,

32:19.400 --> 32:21.080
then you can stop now.

33:26.900 --> 33:27.970
Thanks.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.740
I'll send you the video.

33:30.570 --> 33:31.940
Let's each check it

33:32.210 --> 33:33.610
and discuss it next practice.

33:34.410 --> 33:35.380
Okay.

33:37.710 --> 33:39.550
I heard you're

33:39.550 --> 33:41.380
producing your unit's album this time.

33:41.380 --> 33:42.250
Yes.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.580
I like the new title song.

33:45.490 --> 33:46.920
So I got greedy.

33:47.590 --> 33:48.860
Greedy?

33:53.290 --> 33:55.160
Since our last album,

33:56.160 --> 33:57.830
I felt frustrated.

33:59.700 --> 34:02.240
The more I reached my goal, the more I felt lost.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.110
What does it mean to achieve your dream?

34:06.510 --> 34:08.710
Is there an end? I kept asking these questions.

34:08.909 --> 34:11.110
The "me" right now is made up of

34:11.850 --> 34:15.120
Mars, Calla, and applause from the world.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.820
You might ask if it's bad.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.080
No.

34:20.550 --> 34:21.989
It's the opposite.

34:22.590 --> 34:23.690
It's good.

34:24.690 --> 34:25.989
That's the problem.

34:28.130 --> 34:30.030
It's so good.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.100
But if one of the three is gone,

34:34.000 --> 34:35.570
I don't know if I'll exist.

34:35.739 --> 34:36.870
It's not just

34:37.570 --> 34:39.500
about being forgotten or not.

34:39.870 --> 34:40.870
Right.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.679
And it's not about withstanding it or not.

34:46.510 --> 34:47.909
When the time comes,

34:48.550 --> 34:51.489
what should I define myself as?

34:54.050 --> 34:55.920
I couldn't see the answer.

34:57.490 --> 34:59.190
Everything I do nowadays

34:59.190 --> 35:02.140
is like a struggling process to meet a new me.

35:04.030 --> 35:07.170
Including acting up to help Cotton Candy.

35:11.970 --> 35:14.210
I didn't know you were thinking

35:14.980 --> 35:16.180
those thoughts.

35:17.140 --> 35:18.980
I'm being idle because I have a full stomach, huh?

35:25.120 --> 35:26.520
I've never seen you smile.

35:28.620 --> 35:29.560
Let's go.

35:30.390 --> 35:31.690
I'll take you home.

35:31.890 --> 35:33.230
I have time.

35:34.330 --> 35:36.500
She has somewhere to go with me.

35:38.730 --> 35:40.270
Let's go. We're late.

35:40.270 --> 35:41.470
Where?

35:45.540 --> 35:46.810
You know

35:46.810 --> 35:48.910
we have a reservation system?

35:48.910 --> 35:50.380
You don't make a reservation for emergencies.

35:50.380 --> 35:51.550
Emergency?

35:52.480 --> 35:53.380
What's the emergency?

35:53.380 --> 35:54.850
Is it your head?

35:54.850 --> 35:56.720
You said I should manage my assets.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.020
So?

35:58.020 --> 36:02.120
Why do that while I'm about to happily go home?

36:10.100 --> 36:12.270
You like her, don't you?

36:14.670 --> 36:15.670
Hmph.

36:15.770 --> 36:17.470
What are you talking about?

36:18.100 --> 36:20.610
If I didn't, why would I keep her in my agency?

36:20.610 --> 36:22.710
I heard her team will be expelled.

36:23.310 --> 36:25.640
I got curious and googled her name.

36:25.980 --> 36:29.550
Through a bizarre algorithm, I was led to a video.

36:29.550 --> 36:30.420
Coddle Candy?

36:30.420 --> 36:31.450
Cotton Candy.

36:31.450 --> 36:32.920
Cotton Candy. Anyway.

36:32.920 --> 36:35.290
I know you well.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.530
You would've bean so heartless and nasty.

36:39.790 --> 36:40.760
But then,

36:41.090 --> 36:43.360
you bring the leader of that team here

36:43.360 --> 36:46.300
and stop me from going home twice?

36:46.970 --> 36:49.800
I wrote a comment on their video, too.

36:51.300 --> 36:52.410
Aunt!

37:05.850 --> 37:08.420
I think I can stop getting treatment.

37:09.820 --> 37:11.060
Okay.

37:29.010 --> 37:30.410
Goodbye.

37:40.790 --> 37:42.620
An article will be released tomorrow.

37:42.990 --> 37:44.220
Thank you!

37:49.930 --> 37:52.060
Troy made that kind of analysis?

37:52.400 --> 37:54.230
He knows us so well.

37:55.700 --> 37:56.740
I was surprised.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.270
Isn't it expected?

37:58.270 --> 37:59.640
He told us before.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.780
That we'll sing and he'll write.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.440
He said let's do that forever.

38:05.010 --> 38:06.510
If Troy had been with us,

38:07.150 --> 38:09.220
would we have turned out differently?

38:09.220 --> 38:11.250
We could all have been ruined.

38:13.520 --> 38:15.420
Troy knows what to do,

38:15.420 --> 38:17.090
so the song will be done soon.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.560
How are the choreography and visual concept going?

38:21.490 --> 38:24.830
The chief choreographer will speak.

38:25.030 --> 38:28.440
Yes, I'm contacting a few directors.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.140
Of course, they're turning me down.

38:30.140 --> 38:33.670
But I know their weaknesses, so don't worry.

38:35.410 --> 38:37.440
It's always threats with you.

38:39.310 --> 38:42.350
For the visual concept, we're getting references.

38:42.350 --> 38:43.250
Yes.

38:43.250 --> 38:46.020
The chief of visual concept will speak.

38:46.020 --> 38:47.220
The costume concept

38:47.220 --> 38:49.390
will be black as the base

38:49.390 --> 38:52.730
and a glamorous color in the top or bottom.

38:52.930 --> 38:55.460
For example, a leather bustier

38:55.460 --> 38:57.300
or a bra top.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.130
It'll be clearer once we get the song.

39:00.870 --> 39:02.340
Perfect.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.510
Securing the budget is the problem.

39:06.670 --> 39:09.310
Let's work more part time jobs!

39:09.510 --> 39:10.410
Great.

39:10.710 --> 39:11.880
When the song is done,

39:11.950 --> 39:13.350
let's go into more details.

39:13.350 --> 39:14.350
Okay.

39:14.780 --> 39:16.820
When the collab article is released,

39:16.820 --> 39:19.650
the comment team should get ready to work.

39:28.830 --> 39:30.430
Kim Jenna

39:42.240 --> 39:43.480
Want to try?

39:46.810 --> 39:49.150
Hold here, and wrap your fingers around here...

39:51.020 --> 39:52.850
Great job!

39:54.890 --> 39:56.620
It's good to learn golf in advance.

39:56.990 --> 39:59.730
Let's play a round of golf next time.

39:59.730 --> 40:00.960
Sir.

40:01.260 --> 40:02.060
Yes?

40:05.700 --> 40:07.670
I know you said not to rush,

40:08.700 --> 40:10.200
but I have to know.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.170
How far

40:12.170 --> 40:14.040
do your plans go concerning me?

40:16.210 --> 40:18.610
I don't know if this is a field

40:18.610 --> 40:21.150
I can compare to the business I've been doing.

40:21.710 --> 40:25.390
But if I'm not confident I can make the best,

40:27.520 --> 40:28.920
then I don't even start.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.830
Is that a good answer for you?

40:35.260 --> 40:36.200
Yes.

41:47.870 --> 41:49.800
Hello.

41:51.540 --> 41:53.170
I was going to bed,

41:53.170 --> 41:55.140
but I suddenly wanted to do a live stream.

41:55.170 --> 41:58.120
Live stream / Participants: 0

41:58.240 --> 42:00.910
Because I know no one will be watching.

42:02.150 --> 42:04.550
We have practice tomorrow afternoon.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.690
I'm going to get up early and practice.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.160
Yes. That's right.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.730
I'm practicing for practice.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.530
It's kind of funny.

42:17.260 --> 42:19.430
But I don't want to be a nuisance.

42:20.870 --> 42:21.900
To be honest,

42:21.900 --> 42:24.470
I lack the most in my team.

42:28.030 --> 42:32.450
"This Is Wrong" has entered

42:32.810 --> 42:34.080
Talent

42:34.250 --> 42:36.180
is something I can't control.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.380
I was the first to dream

42:38.380 --> 42:40.420
of being an idol singer and prepare for it.

42:41.490 --> 42:44.160
I spent the longest time practicing.

42:44.690 --> 42:46.090
When we were trainees,

42:46.090 --> 42:48.060
Hyun-ji could copy after watching the dance once.

42:48.060 --> 42:51.100
I practiced one move all night long.

42:52.770 --> 42:53.870
Talent,

42:54.270 --> 42:56.140
ability and looks.

42:56.470 --> 42:58.150
I'm right in the middle.

42:58.340 --> 42:59.470
Sometimes,

42:59.470 --> 43:01.370
I think maybe we failed

43:01.880 --> 43:04.140
because of me.

43:08.110 --> 43:10.820
But my members have never criticized me.

43:13.820 --> 43:16.260
They know I'm just a free-rider.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.260
But they love me nevertheless.

43:19.660 --> 43:21.330
Thank you. And I love you.

43:24.700 --> 43:28.330
Shine like that

43:28.330 --> 43:31.940
Please keep shining brightly

43:31.940 --> 43:33.410
Right here, this is Cloud-Nine

43:33.410 --> 43:38.850
I can take you higher

43:38.850 --> 43:43.180
To another cloud higher than the cloud you see there

43:42.720 --> 43:47.120
"This Is Wrong" has entered

43:43.180 --> 43:48.790
I can take you higher

43:48.790 --> 43:54.990
The ninth big cloud over there (Cloud-Nine)

43:55.660 --> 43:59.900
My eyes are only for you

44:00.570 --> 44:04.740
My everything exists for you

44:04.740 --> 44:08.510
Now that I know you

44:10.380 --> 44:11.640
What did you just say?

44:12.010 --> 44:12.810
Huh?

44:13.080 --> 44:14.580
Cotton Candy's producer

44:14.780 --> 44:15.850
is who?

44:15.980 --> 44:17.280
Troy...

44:20.790 --> 44:22.160
Darn it...

44:26.660 --> 44:27.660
Did you

44:27.660 --> 44:29.960
know Troy was producing for Cotton Candy?

44:36.770 --> 44:37.770
Hey.

44:37.770 --> 44:39.040
What's up with Bbiyong?

44:40.570 --> 44:42.110
Let's listen to the guide.

44:45.610 --> 44:47.510
Hi. It's me.

44:48.610 --> 44:49.980
Look into something for me.

44:49.980 --> 44:52.620
Mars, special collab scheduled with

44:50.020 --> 44:52.720
Mars, special collab scheduled
with Starpeace senior Cotton Candy

44:52.620 --> 44:55.920
Starpeace senior Cotton Candy!

44:58.560 --> 44:59.290
Jeez.

44:59.290 --> 45:00.930
This is so annoying.

45:01.430 --> 45:04.400
How can they use a five-year-old tacky photo?

45:07.430 --> 45:10.040
But Elle is in the photo.

45:11.300 --> 45:12.810
What if she gets mad?

45:15.480 --> 45:16.910
It's okay.

45:16.910 --> 45:18.340
She won't see it anyway.

45:19.610 --> 45:20.880
What a tie-in sale.

45:20.880 --> 45:22.350
Who are these nobodies?

45:22.350 --> 45:23.920
Why are they collaborating with Mars?

45:23.920 --> 45:24.850
I'm not being mean.

45:24.850 --> 45:26.520
I just really want to know.

45:26.520 --> 45:28.520
Did you sell your conscience off?

45:28.520 --> 45:30.290
I guess they have no pride.

45:30.290 --> 45:32.390
A senior sponging off of a junior?

45:32.390 --> 45:34.030
They're so rude!

45:34.030 --> 45:36.260
Should I fight them in person again?

45:36.800 --> 45:37.600
Hyun-ji.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.730
You know your words and face don't match, right?

45:39.730 --> 45:42.770
A collab article has 800 comments?

45:42.770 --> 45:45.640
We have a strong presence.

45:46.210 --> 45:47.470
Don't spoil it for me.

45:47.470 --> 45:50.180
It's not Mars, it's our strong presence.

45:50.180 --> 45:51.180
Yes, Ma'am.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.880
We're getting more subscribers.

45:55.550 --> 45:57.250
Half of the comments are nasty.

45:57.250 --> 45:58.850
The other half is cheering for us.

45:59.250 --> 46:01.890
- Good!
- That's awesome!

46:05.630 --> 46:06.590
I think

46:06.590 --> 46:07.930
we have to buy a car.

46:08.190 --> 46:09.630
We need it for our career.

46:09.630 --> 46:10.630
Good.

46:12.330 --> 46:13.300
I don't know.

46:13.300 --> 46:14.700
Just buy it.

46:14.730 --> 46:15.830
Mars supports Cotton Candy through collab

46:15.830 --> 46:17.630
Starpeace's official #1 group Cotton Candy
announces independent comeback

46:17.630 --> 46:19.830
Revealed disbanding after becoming No.1
in music show with 2nd album

46:41.190 --> 46:45.060
KillA So-yeon

46:43.260 --> 46:45.230
We have practice today.

46:45.230 --> 46:47.000
Come to the studio by 4 PM.

46:54.440 --> 46:55.610
Okay, okay.

46:55.610 --> 46:56.540
I'm going, I'm going.

46:56.540 --> 46:57.480
Let go!

46:57.480 --> 46:58.640
Seriously!

46:58.640 --> 46:59.910
You're being too harsh!

46:59.910 --> 47:01.110
Why are you still upset?

47:01.110 --> 47:01.680
Go.

47:01.680 --> 47:03.380
Alright, I'm going!

47:05.820 --> 47:07.020
Did you go inside?

47:07.250 --> 47:09.050
I cussed at him a long time ago.

47:09.070 --> 47:10.530
Why's he still upset?

47:10.560 --> 47:13.230
I told you to wait for me. Why'd you go in?

47:13.230 --> 47:15.210
Kim said he'll kill you if he sees you

47:15.210 --> 47:16.940
one more time.

47:16.960 --> 47:17.600
What?

47:17.600 --> 47:19.300
Why are you telling me this now?

47:19.800 --> 47:21.170
That's not the problem.

47:21.170 --> 47:22.470
What? Why?

47:22.470 --> 47:23.710
Did all the choreography directors in Korea

47:23.710 --> 47:24.970
say they'll boycott me?

47:24.970 --> 47:26.250
It's about Elle.

47:35.750 --> 47:38.220
How's the response after the article?

47:39.390 --> 47:40.390
Oh.

47:40.490 --> 47:42.890
The best marketing is noise marketing.

47:44.790 --> 47:47.290
Mean comments are better than no comments.

47:47.860 --> 47:49.600
You still think dangerously.

47:50.260 --> 47:51.460
Can you change

47:52.630 --> 47:54.500
those mean comments to compliments?

47:55.700 --> 47:56.700
No.

47:58.340 --> 48:00.410
We'll go on with the power of those mean comments.

48:02.310 --> 48:04.080
Since we have no tomorrow.

48:04.810 --> 48:06.450
Are you trying to be funny?

48:07.450 --> 48:08.580
Jeez...

48:09.980 --> 48:11.080
Wow.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.690
How nice.

48:17.990 --> 48:20.730
Calla is devastated because of the collab,

48:20.890 --> 48:22.800
but are you feeling good, Sir?

48:22.800 --> 48:23.730
You're mistaken.

48:23.730 --> 48:24.960
I feel bad.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.270
Hey.

48:32.070 --> 48:34.040
Are you sure there's nothing going on?

48:37.640 --> 48:38.980
Kim Jenna!

48:43.320 --> 48:45.550
I was wrong about you.

48:45.720 --> 48:47.250
I regret that.

48:49.050 --> 48:51.620
But you shouldn't be so spiteful.

48:51.620 --> 48:52.620
Huh?

48:56.030 --> 48:57.100
About Troy.

48:57.930 --> 48:58.930
He okayed

48:59.100 --> 49:01.000
producing your song?

49:02.740 --> 49:03.870
You tramp.

49:14.180 --> 49:16.120
I really didn't understand.

49:16.850 --> 49:18.920
How can he work with you again?

49:18.920 --> 49:20.620
He said he wouldn't sleep

49:20.620 --> 49:22.560
until he saw you get ruined.

49:23.920 --> 49:24.990
But he said

49:25.290 --> 49:26.630
he'll work with you again?

49:26.630 --> 49:29.800
Troy is going to get his petty revenge.

49:31.130 --> 49:34.330
And you're incredible to help him do that.

49:41.010 --> 49:42.640
He made her crawl back

49:43.180 --> 49:44.860
to the team she deserted.

49:45.010 --> 49:46.010
What's more,

49:46.550 --> 49:47.950
as a backup dancer.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
What the?

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Hey!

50:42.000 --> 50:42.970
Hey, hey!

50:42.970 --> 50:43.440
Wait.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.300
How could you do this?

50:45.300 --> 50:46.170
How?

50:46.170 --> 50:48.340
Hey, hey! What's going on?

51:02.220 --> 51:03.390
What the?

51:05.660 --> 51:06.790
Kim Jenna?

51:07.160 --> 51:08.130
Get your stuff.

51:08.990 --> 51:09.660
Let's go.

51:09.660 --> 51:10.600
Excuse me.

51:10.830 --> 51:12.300
Can't you see we're practicing?

51:12.300 --> 51:13.300
I'm sorry.

51:14.070 --> 51:14.800
Let's go!

51:14.800 --> 51:16.500
What are you doing?

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Hey.

51:18.640 --> 51:19.640
Elle.

51:23.510 --> 51:25.210
Leave. We're practicing.

51:27.610 --> 51:28.610
We?

51:31.550 --> 51:32.620
Practice?

51:34.750 --> 51:35.890
What "we"?

51:37.490 --> 51:39.330
What "practice"?

51:42.860 --> 51:44.600
Is this what you wanted?

51:44.600 --> 51:45.600
Leave.

51:46.130 --> 51:47.270
Stop disturbing us.

51:50.140 --> 51:51.900
- Let go!
- Hey!

51:53.040 --> 51:55.640
Don't start fighting here. Talk outside.

52:06.290 --> 52:07.790
What in the world is wrong with you?

52:08.390 --> 52:10.190
I did everything you wanted.

52:10.190 --> 52:12.160
This isn't what I wanted.

52:12.160 --> 52:13.190
Kim Jenna.

52:13.930 --> 52:16.030
Get a grip and do one thing.

52:16.030 --> 52:17.830
What you wanted was Troy.

52:18.600 --> 52:20.800
You knew something would happen

52:20.800 --> 52:22.470
when you came to me.

52:23.470 --> 52:24.470
Still.

52:26.110 --> 52:26.940
This is wrong.

52:26.940 --> 52:28.790
Stop acting so naïve.

52:29.170 --> 52:31.240
Then you thought we'd cry and make up?

52:31.240 --> 52:33.110
You could've said no.

52:34.680 --> 52:36.520
If you did what Troy wanted,

52:37.380 --> 52:39.080
did you think we'd like it?

52:39.790 --> 52:41.990
Are you doing this just to torment us?

52:42.320 --> 52:43.420
Do you

52:44.720 --> 52:46.160
hate us that much?

52:49.830 --> 52:51.830
You still haven't come to your senses.

52:51.830 --> 52:53.130
You have the leisure of talking

52:53.130 --> 52:55.370
about who's tormenting who.

52:56.940 --> 52:58.800
I said I'm settling my account.

53:04.480 --> 53:05.480
Listen up.

53:06.810 --> 53:08.710
This is my best chance now.

53:08.710 --> 53:10.650
I'm going to take it no matter what.

53:12.050 --> 53:14.220
I'm going this far for you guys.

53:14.220 --> 53:15.820
You won't keep interfering, will you?

53:17.960 --> 53:19.530
- Chance?
- Yes.

53:19.530 --> 53:21.690
Whenever you want to interfere, remember this.

53:21.890 --> 53:24.000
I'll do worse than this

53:25.000 --> 53:27.270
to get you off my back.

53:45.020 --> 53:46.020
Hello?

53:48.150 --> 53:49.150
Jenna!

53:49.760 --> 53:51.890
It's mutual, so all we need to do is settle.

53:51.890 --> 53:53.490
Who's settling?

53:53.490 --> 53:56.330
Hey! Let's do time in the slammer!

53:56.330 --> 53:57.230
Hey!

53:57.230 --> 53:58.630
You do time in the slammer!

53:58.630 --> 53:59.800
You hit me first!

53:59.800 --> 54:01.170
You still haven't...

54:01.170 --> 54:02.300
Ma'am!

54:02.300 --> 54:04.070
You're not in the position to lose your temper.

54:04.070 --> 54:05.600
You're at a greater disadvantage.

54:05.600 --> 54:06.540
Right?

54:06.540 --> 54:09.480
I was just working in my studio. That's all.

54:09.480 --> 54:12.010
You also hit her, so you both committed assault.

54:12.010 --> 54:14.610
It seems like you know each other. Make up and go.

54:14.610 --> 54:17.050
Or this'll be handed to the prosecution.

54:17.050 --> 54:19.050
How can a cop do such lousy work?

54:19.050 --> 54:21.090
Go by the law!

54:22.490 --> 54:23.860
Get a grip.

54:24.460 --> 54:25.960
Seriously.

54:27.230 --> 54:30.400
Hey! I have no intention of settling with you.

54:30.400 --> 54:32.160
Okay, okay.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.100
Jeez.

54:35.100 --> 54:37.640
You're not even human! You know that?

54:38.000 --> 54:39.400
We get that.

54:40.310 --> 54:41.610
I'm sorry, Jenna.

54:41.610 --> 54:43.910
I shouldn't have told Hyun-ji.

54:46.410 --> 54:47.980
Take her and leave.

54:49.420 --> 54:50.380
Hey, you jerk.

54:50.380 --> 54:52.580
If you write songs with that attitude,

54:52.580 --> 54:54.250
is that a song? It's a curse!

54:54.490 --> 54:57.360
You're cursing this whole world, you know that?

54:57.360 --> 54:58.890
Okay, let's just go.

54:59.320 --> 55:00.490
Let go. Jeez.

55:00.790 --> 55:02.660
Consider yourself lucky.

55:03.830 --> 55:05.530
Why I ought to...

55:24.580 --> 55:26.180
Why did you do that?

55:29.620 --> 55:31.620
You liked Elle.

55:33.830 --> 55:36.560
How can you do that to someone you liked?

55:38.430 --> 55:40.500
This is what's wrong with you girls.

55:40.730 --> 55:43.140
Doesn't it occur to you that I was hurt that much?

55:47.740 --> 55:48.740
Troy.

55:53.310 --> 55:56.180
Do you still write musical notes on music paper?

55:59.720 --> 56:02.090
You said that's the only way a song comes out.

56:02.820 --> 56:05.720
In a world where you can write a song with chords,

56:06.930 --> 56:08.690
you did that intentionally.

56:10.560 --> 56:12.230
The friction from the pencil

56:12.230 --> 56:13.930
and paper inspired you.

56:15.330 --> 56:17.640
That's why you didn't say you "made" a song

56:17.870 --> 56:19.550
but you "wrote" a song.

56:21.410 --> 56:23.470
We'd say you were being cringy.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.740
That you were an old-timer.

56:26.550 --> 56:27.910
That you were dowdy.

56:27.910 --> 56:29.010
You scared me!

56:38.390 --> 56:39.910
You were like that.

56:44.030 --> 56:45.060
Remember?

56:45.500 --> 56:46.930
You write.

56:47.800 --> 56:49.270
And we sing.

56:50.700 --> 56:52.640
It was a simple dream.

56:55.410 --> 56:56.580
At that time,

56:57.610 --> 56:59.280
our dream was so simple

57:00.480 --> 57:03.050
that we didn't think it would evade us.

57:06.550 --> 57:08.550
But this is how we turned out.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.620
You made a mistake.

57:13.360 --> 57:15.460
We didn't embrace you.

57:17.960 --> 57:21.130
CEO Ma didn't give you a chance for one mistake.

57:22.430 --> 57:24.500
The company hastily kicked you out.

57:25.040 --> 57:26.970
We are all to blame.

57:32.610 --> 57:34.050
I'll be going now.

57:38.420 --> 57:39.620
Hey, Kim Jenna.

57:42.390 --> 57:44.060
I don't write musical notes anymore.

57:49.590 --> 57:50.930
So choose.

57:51.500 --> 57:52.930
Is it Elle or me?

57:53.530 --> 57:55.070
Is it Elle or Cotton Candy?

58:06.350 --> 58:07.650
You write.

58:08.610 --> 58:09.980
And we sing.

58:12.250 --> 58:14.220
It was a simple dream.

58:20.290 --> 58:22.660
It's a show at Select Beauty's 10th anniversary.

58:23.460 --> 58:24.830
KillA still

58:24.830 --> 58:27.570
doesn't know why Troy asked them

58:27.770 --> 58:28.970
for that favor.

58:28.970 --> 58:30.840
They have history with Elle.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.370
So they accepted her readily.

58:32.700 --> 58:33.810
Thinking it's a chance.

58:34.040 --> 58:36.240
Why is everyone out to get revenge?

58:36.240 --> 58:38.410
What did we do so wrong?

58:38.410 --> 58:39.850
What do we do now?

58:40.080 --> 58:41.580
Should we leave Elle like that?

58:41.580 --> 58:43.580
She said she'll keep doing it.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.850
Still, we can't turn a blind eye.

58:46.250 --> 58:48.820
Seriously! That crazy bastard!

58:49.620 --> 58:50.620
Jenna.

58:51.160 --> 58:52.220
What do we do?

59:07.810 --> 59:09.780
Wow! I caught it!

59:11.180 --> 59:14.180
- Cool!
- Sexy!

59:14.480 --> 59:16.360
Mars! Mars! Mars!

59:16.360 --> 59:17.650
Cotton Candy! Cotton Candy!

59:44.210 --> 59:45.210
Jenna.

59:53.520 --> 59:54.950
KillA's show

59:55.520 --> 59:57.120
is on the same day and time

59:58.060 --> 1:00:00.430
as our collab performance.

1:00:01.530 --> 1:00:04.130
While we sing and dance happily,

1:00:05.330 --> 1:00:07.330
Elle will be dancing KillA's dance.

1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:12.440
Even if Elle is insisting on it,

1:00:13.770 --> 1:00:16.140
I don't know if we should turn a blind eye.

1:00:17.110 --> 1:00:19.040
I feel conflicted.

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:21.450
Stella.

1:00:21.580 --> 1:00:23.620
Troy saying yes.

1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:25.980
Getting to do the collab.

1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:27.780
Having an article about us.

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:32.660
People finally being interested in us.

1:00:35.030 --> 1:00:36.900
It was fun for a few days, right?

1:00:37.730 --> 1:00:38.730
Yeah.

1:00:39.630 --> 1:00:41.600
Things happened so easily.

1:00:42.430 --> 1:00:45.400
I wondered why it wasn't this easy before.

1:00:45.740 --> 1:00:46.940
Right.

1:00:49.470 --> 1:00:51.980
So we were momentarily deceived.

1:00:53.350 --> 1:00:56.110
There's no way the world would be so kind to us.

1:00:58.250 --> 1:00:59.250
Right?

1:01:02.320 --> 1:01:03.320
Stella.

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:07.360
Troy told me

1:01:08.630 --> 1:01:10.700
to choose between Elle and him.

1:01:13.060 --> 1:01:14.830
Between Elle and Cotton Candy.

1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:20.470
Just like how it was for him in the past.

1:01:31.380 --> 1:01:32.850
Even if it's not with Troy,

1:01:34.420 --> 1:01:36.050
we can do it.

1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:56.540
Wow, you're unbelievable.

1:01:56.540 --> 1:01:58.910
I heard Troy's still working on your song.

1:02:00.210 --> 1:02:02.180
I didn't know Elle would

1:02:02.180 --> 1:02:04.510
sacrifice herself for your revival.

1:02:06.950 --> 1:02:07.950
Right?

1:02:08.820 --> 1:02:10.720
The way of the world is astonishing.

1:02:16.490 --> 1:02:17.560
Bbiyong.

1:02:17.730 --> 1:02:18.900
Don't worry.

1:02:20.230 --> 1:02:22.430
Things will turn out as you wish.

1:02:27.340 --> 1:02:28.340
Why?

1:02:28.710 --> 1:02:30.340
Are you giving up?

1:02:32.510 --> 1:02:33.510
Good.

1:02:34.580 --> 1:02:36.150
That's more like Cotton Candy.

1:02:35.990 --> 1:02:37.090
Cotton Candy channel comment analysis results
Public opinion of collab articles

1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:41.350
It's a relief that the response to the collab

1:02:41.350 --> 1:02:42.550
isn't as bad as we thought.

1:02:42.550 --> 1:02:45.860
The likes and dislikes are 49:51. That's not bad?

1:02:46.020 --> 1:02:48.790
I thought it'd be 1:99.

1:02:49.030 --> 1:02:51.200
That 1 would be you.

1:02:52.300 --> 1:02:53.900
Why would I be 1?

1:02:54.300 --> 1:02:55.970
You approved of it.

1:02:56.100 --> 1:02:57.300
Observing you,

1:02:57.640 --> 1:02:58.570
you seem to be on their side.

1:02:58.570 --> 1:02:59.400
Observing you,

1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:00.870
you seem to treat me too casually.

1:03:01.270 --> 1:03:03.310
You're American.

1:03:03.310 --> 1:03:05.980
You like being casual.

1:03:06.340 --> 1:03:08.710
I grew up eating kimchi and bean paste soup.

1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:10.020
Oh. Okay.

1:03:10.420 --> 1:03:11.680
Well, anyway,

1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:13.250
we passed the crisis.

1:03:13.950 --> 1:03:15.620
I thought Calla would go crazy.

1:03:15.620 --> 1:03:17.460
But there are some people rooting for them.

1:03:17.460 --> 1:03:19.720
Cotton Candy's victim act worked.

1:03:20.260 --> 1:03:22.790
It fits the mood of the charity concert, too.

1:03:22.790 --> 1:03:24.960
There's no right answer in this world.

1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:27.830
Seo Ji-han also wrote an emotional comment.

1:03:30.900 --> 1:03:31.970
He is

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:33.310
dangerous.

1:03:33.310 --> 1:03:34.410
Jeez.

1:03:34.410 --> 1:03:35.470
No, really...

1:03:37.810 --> 1:03:38.780
What's this?

1:03:38.780 --> 1:03:39.880
Why are you here?

1:03:41.380 --> 1:03:42.380
Excuse me.

1:03:43.150 --> 1:03:45.550
We have something to say to you, Sir.

1:03:45.550 --> 1:03:47.020
Where's Kim Jenna?

1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:51.760
Sir.

1:03:52.290 --> 1:03:54.460
Thank you so much

1:03:54.630 --> 1:03:56.030
for paying attention to us.

1:03:56.030 --> 1:03:57.660
But let me apologize,

1:03:58.100 --> 1:04:00.600
I mean, ask a favor of you.

1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:02.230
Come on, Stella. Don't.

1:04:02.230 --> 1:04:04.670
No apologies. No favors. Do nothing.

1:04:04.670 --> 1:04:06.270
- We..
- No! We won't listen.

1:04:06.270 --> 1:04:07.670
Hyun-ji! You know my stock tanked, right?

1:04:07.670 --> 1:04:09.140
Tell my wife. Tell her. Now. Huh?

1:04:09.140 --> 1:04:11.040
Stop cutting her off.

1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:17.550
The collab with Mars...

1:04:19.820 --> 1:04:21.180
We'll give it up.

1:04:30.300 --> 1:04:33.100
You're going to do what?

1:04:35.070 --> 1:04:36.530
In the upcoming KillA show,

1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:38.900
let me join as your backup dancer.

1:04:40.740 --> 1:04:41.870
Please.

1:05:08.410 --> 1:05:10.880
IDOL
[IDOL: The Coup]

1:05:11.100 --> 1:05:13.040
Elle, Troy, backup dancer?

1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:14.870
She chose not to give up on either of us.

1:05:14.870 --> 1:05:17.140
You know what kind of opportunity that was.

1:05:17.140 --> 1:05:18.080
The collab is canceled?

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:19.280
The article was exaggerated.

1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:20.410
That's not what's important!

1:05:20.410 --> 1:05:21.780
Can't you see Mars was made a fool?

1:05:21.780 --> 1:05:23.750
- Mars...
- Mars is okay.

1:05:23.750 --> 1:05:26.750
If you can't bear it, come back.

1:05:26.750 --> 1:05:29.190
I'll do everything I can to make you No.1.

1:05:29.190 --> 1:05:31.660
Is this "tribute" I've only heard about?

1:05:33.430 --> 1:05:34.760
Do you need the agency's help?

1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:36.660
No, making it on our own

1:05:36.660 --> 1:05:37.730
was the rule of this game.

1:05:37.730 --> 1:05:38.920
Okay then.
