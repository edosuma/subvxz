â™ª

00:05.071 --> 00:06.471
(glasses clink)

00:06.539 --> 00:07.973
(two claps)

00:08.039 --> 00:10.776
Welcome to this very
special rush evening

00:10.843 --> 00:13.345
of the new and improved
Kappa Kappa Tau.

00:13.412 --> 00:14.880
I'm Zayday Williams, president,

00:14.947 --> 00:18.016
and this is my vice
president, Grace Gardner.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.718
We would also like to thank Dean Munsch

00:19.786 --> 00:21.920
for allowing us to have a
winter semester rush this year.

00:21.988 --> 00:24.756
Well, now that the unfortunate events

00:24.824 --> 00:26.925
of the fall semester are behind us

00:26.993 --> 00:30.095
and the school is back
open and extremely safe,

00:30.163 --> 00:31.897
I thought, why not?

00:31.964 --> 00:35.567
Especially since the new Kappa
seems to be aligned so clearly

00:35.635 --> 00:37.769
with mine and the rest
of the student body's

00:37.837 --> 00:41.173
almost militant commitment
to political correctness

00:41.240 --> 00:44.109
and acceptance of different
and unusual points of view.

00:44.177 --> 00:46.411
As long as they're always left-leaning.

00:46.479 --> 00:48.213
Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:48.281 --> 00:52.984
I'm gonna go disinvite Jerry Seinfeld
from speaking at commencement.

00:53.052 --> 00:55.053
He told a joke about a woman once.

00:55.121 --> 00:56.054
Allegedly.

00:56.122 --> 00:57.055
(women murmur)

00:58.357 --> 01:00.892
We would also like to introduce
you to our treasurer,

01:00.960 --> 01:02.360
Hester Ulrich.

01:04.163 --> 01:07.532
Excuse me. Is it still true that you
guys take anyone who wants to pledge?

01:07.600 --> 01:09.201
It's actually now written
in the Kappa bylaws.

01:10.303 --> 01:12.404
So today is going to
be filled with us...

01:12.471 --> 01:14.406
HESTER: <i>Hi. It's me, Hester.</i>

01:14.473 --> 01:16.842
<i>You may have noticed my eye patch.
It's temporary.</i>

01:16.909 --> 01:18.510
<i>The advantage of stabbing
yourself in the eye</i>

01:18.578 --> 01:20.445
<i>with a stiletto heel is that you know</i>

01:20.513 --> 01:23.048
<i>just where to jab it in order
to miss the important organs,</i>

01:23.115 --> 01:24.983
<i>like your optic nerve or your brain.</i>

01:25.051 --> 01:27.285
<i>You might have noticed that
I'm the only Chanel left.</i>

01:27.353 --> 01:29.454
<i>That's because I got away with it.</i>

01:29.522 --> 01:31.289
<i>It was a plan 20 years in the making,</i>

01:31.357 --> 01:33.058
<i>and it worked.</i>

01:33.082 --> 01:36.054
- sync and corrections by Caio -

01:36.128 --> 01:38.063
<i>You probably think that growing up</i>

01:38.130 --> 01:39.664
<i>in a mental institution would be fun.</i>

01:39.732 --> 01:42.167
<i>Plenty of cigarettes and Monopoly.</i>

01:42.235 --> 01:45.637
(both shrieking)

01:45.705 --> 01:47.305
<i>But it was hard at first.</i>

01:47.373 --> 01:48.440
(Gigi sobbing)

01:48.507 --> 01:50.008
<i>Gigi was pretty bummed out</i>

01:50.076 --> 01:51.977
<i>about her sister killing
herself with laxatives,</i>

01:52.044 --> 01:53.979
- _
- <i>and she cried a lot.</i>

01:54.046 --> 01:56.081
(sobbing loudly)

01:56.148 --> 01:58.116
<i>For three years.</i>

01:58.184 --> 01:59.484
(sobbing continues)

01:59.552 --> 02:02.787
<i>But with the help of good doctors
and nurses at the asylum,</i>

02:02.855 --> 02:03.339
_

02:03.364 --> 02:04.814
<i>Gigi was able to turn
her sadness into anger,</i>

02:04.857 --> 02:07.125
<i>and we started planning our revenge.</i>

02:07.193 --> 02:09.928
(sobbing continues)

02:09.996 --> 02:12.597
- _
- Now, this is a hammer.

02:12.665 --> 02:16.101
Hammers are good for bashing
people in the skull

02:16.168 --> 02:18.303
and watching them bleed to death, okay?

02:18.371 --> 02:20.305
Now, how about this?

02:20.373 --> 02:22.507
- Knife!
- Okay.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.142
How about this one?

02:24.210 --> 02:25.644
- Chain saw.
- Great!

02:25.711 --> 02:27.612
Now, what are the
advantages of using this?

02:27.680 --> 02:29.948
Easily cuts through muscle and bone,

02:30.016 --> 02:31.516
and has the added
advantage of making sure

02:31.584 --> 02:33.518
your victim's final emotion is terror.

02:33.586 --> 02:34.552
Suck ass!

02:34.620 --> 02:36.554
That's great, Hester.

02:36.622 --> 02:38.056
Now, let's maybe let Boone
answer the next one.

02:38.124 --> 02:40.025
- But he's a moron.
- I know.

02:40.092 --> 02:41.960
I know.

02:42.028 --> 02:43.395
Ow!

02:45.197 --> 02:47.132
(children grunting)

02:47.199 --> 02:49.134
HESTER: <i>We grew. Time passed.</i>

02:49.201 --> 02:50.535
<i>It did get a little lonely there.</i>

02:50.603 --> 02:52.671
<i>Sometimes I made friends,</i>

02:52.738 --> 02:54.172
<i>but then the next thing you know,</i>

02:54.240 --> 02:56.007
<i>they're getting a full
frontal lobotomy.</i>

03:02.081 --> 03:04.049
<i>Gigi said that we would
be headed to Wallace</i>

03:04.116 --> 03:05.850
<i>to finally put our plan into action,</i>

03:05.918 --> 03:08.386
<i>so I needed a persona to hide behind</i>

03:08.454 --> 03:09.524
<i>while we murdered people and stuff.</i>

03:09.730 --> 03:11.500
<i>Boone decided that his would
be to pretend to be gay,</i>

03:11.501 --> 03:13.948
<i>which made, like, no sense,
since all that would do is</i>

03:13.949 --> 03:15.618
<i>make him stand out amongst
those frat dudes.</i>

03:16.495 --> 03:18.396
<i>But Boone was never one
for really being smart.</i>

03:18.464 --> 03:19.965
<i>As for me, what I've noticed is that</i>

03:20.032 --> 03:21.700
<i>the more weird and gross you are,</i>

03:21.767 --> 03:24.002
<i>the less people want to know about you.</i>

03:24.070 --> 03:25.670
<i>No one asks the kid with terrible acne</i>

03:25.738 --> 03:28.373
<i>what their favorite movie
is or where they were born.</i>

03:28.441 --> 03:30.008
<i>Even though I only ate asylum food</i>

03:30.076 --> 03:31.576
<i>and never really
exercised, I was blessed</i>

03:31.644 --> 03:33.178
<i>with a super tight bod.</i>

03:33.245 --> 03:35.080
<i>My butt could launch a thousand ships,</i>

03:35.147 --> 03:37.115
<i>and my boobs were
remarkably perky and even.</i>

03:37.183 --> 03:39.017
<i>Couple that with my BJ lips,</i>

03:39.085 --> 03:41.119
<i>and I was gonna need
something pretty spectacular</i>

03:41.187 --> 03:43.688
<i>to keep everyone from wanting
to get all up in this.</i>

03:43.756 --> 03:48.560
<i>Once I saw her, I knew I found
my cloak of social invisibility.</i>

03:53.099 --> 03:54.599
(thunder rumbling)

04:02.975 --> 04:04.709
<i>We needed a cool costume.</i>

04:04.777 --> 04:06.044
<i>All killers have a cool costume...</i>

04:06.112 --> 04:07.846
<i>Jason with his hockey mask,</i>

04:07.913 --> 04:09.647
<i>Freddy Krueger's sweater and hat,</i>

04:09.715 --> 04:12.884
<i>Cujo's totally realistic dog costume.</i>

04:16.255 --> 04:17.389
Hey, everyone!

04:17.456 --> 04:19.724
Come down to Jesse
Helms Stadium tonight

04:19.791 --> 04:23.028
to cheer on our very
own Wallace University

04:23.095 --> 04:25.463
Red Devils!

04:25.531 --> 04:28.366
Kickoff at 7:00 p.m.! (whoops)

04:37.043 --> 04:38.576
<i>(knife stabbing, man gasping)</i>

04:38.644 --> 04:40.111
HESTER: <i>Kind of ironic
that our first victim</i>

04:40.179 --> 04:41.780
<i>was actually the Red Devil,</i>

04:41.847 --> 04:43.014
<i>but when you want to
make an omelet, right?</i>

04:43.082 --> 04:45.083
(nife stabbing, man gasping)

04:47.853 --> 04:49.621
<i>But the devil outfit was perfect.</i>

04:49.688 --> 04:51.489
<i>Unisex, kind of satanic</i>

04:51.557 --> 04:53.091
<i>but not, like, a giant
goat head satanic.</i>

04:53.159 --> 04:55.326
<i>Red and black so it wouldn't stain</i>

04:55.394 --> 04:56.761
<i>when it was covered in blood.</i>

04:56.829 --> 04:58.630
<i>And since it was the school mascot,</i>

04:58.697 --> 05:00.899
<i>we could walk around campus
in it without being noticed.</i>

05:00.966 --> 05:02.600
GIGI: I think he's dead.

05:02.668 --> 05:04.002
HESTER: <i>It was time to begin.</i>

05:04.070 --> 05:06.538
<i>We broke into Kappa and we got busy.</i>

05:09.041 --> 05:10.608
BOONE: I don't understand why

05:10.676 --> 05:12.243
we don't just stab this Dorkus girl.

05:12.311 --> 05:13.945
Because this is more dramatic.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.147
I don't know. Stabbing
can be pretty dramatic.

05:16.215 --> 05:20.318
No, this is more poetic. It hits
these girls right in their vanity.

05:20.386 --> 05:21.986
Wait, we're spraying
acid on the furniture?

05:22.054 --> 05:23.354
How's that gonna hurt them?

05:23.422 --> 05:26.024
Just pour the acid in!

05:26.092 --> 05:28.026
HESTER: <i>Obvi, I was the
brains of the operation.</i>

05:28.094 --> 05:33.098
<i>Boone was the muscle, and Gigi was the
weird and psycho beating black heart.</i>

05:33.165 --> 05:36.067
<i>We did have to get into college
before we could execute our plan.</i>

05:36.135 --> 05:37.469
<i>Hard, since we never
went to high school.</i>

05:37.536 --> 05:39.604
Boone went undercover
<i>year before I did.</i>

05:39.672 --> 05:41.606
<i>never actually rolled in school.</i>

05:41.674 --> 05:43.608
<i>Since none of those frat
guys ever went to class,</i>

05:43.676 --> 05:45.243
<i>it was easy to just show up there,</i>

05:45.311 --> 05:47.045
<i>say he was a student,
and blend right in.</i>

05:47.113 --> 05:48.046
<i>But I wanted to do it right.</i>

05:48.114 --> 05:49.872
Well, Hester,

05:50.016 --> 05:52.883
your high school transcripts
are clearly faked.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.854
And I'm guessing you
made up your SAT scores,

05:55.921 --> 05:58.022
'cause it's not possible to get
one million percent on them.

05:58.090 --> 05:59.591
Now, that being said,

05:59.658 --> 06:01.860
we do have a new mandate
here at Wallace University

06:01.927 --> 06:03.795
for special needs diversity.

06:03.863 --> 06:07.632
And seeing as we have no students
with severe spinal deformities,

06:07.700 --> 06:11.870
I... am gonna take a chance on you.

06:12.771 --> 06:13.638
(stamp thuds)

06:15.074 --> 06:16.007
Welcome to Wallace.

06:16.075 --> 06:18.209
Thank you, Dean. You won't regret it.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.211
(footsteps echoing)

06:23.215 --> 06:23.982
Hi.

06:25.117 --> 06:26.050
Ooh, cool neck brace.

06:26.118 --> 06:26.918
You ever think about decorating it?

06:26.986 --> 06:28.086
(gasps)

06:28.154 --> 06:29.354
I've got a Bedazzler back in my room.

06:29.421 --> 06:31.089
What do you say we spice it up a bit?

06:31.157 --> 06:34.092
Um, no. But that sounds
like a lot of fun.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.027
I hope you guys aren't
freaked out by my appearance

06:36.095 --> 06:37.529
or lack of social skills and money.

06:37.596 --> 06:40.064
Hardly. We're part of a new
wave of Kappa Kappa Tau,

06:40.132 --> 06:42.433
one filled with true
sisterhood and acceptance.

06:42.501 --> 06:44.936
Zayday here is gonna be president
of this place someday.

06:45.004 --> 06:46.504
Come on. Let's go mingle, babies.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.106
I'll catch up.

06:48.174 --> 06:50.341
By the way, you guys seem really nice.

06:50.409 --> 06:53.044
I've always said that being
nice is a really good quality.

06:53.112 --> 06:54.913
It could save your life one day.

06:54.980 --> 06:56.247
Hmm.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.715
(chuckles) Great.

06:57.783 --> 06:59.884
HESTER: <i>And so it came to be</i>

06:59.952 --> 07:02.887
<i>that Hester Ulrich,
daughter of Sophia Doyle,</i>

07:02.955 --> 07:05.690
<i>returned to Kappa House
to get her revenge.</i>

07:05.758 --> 07:07.692
<i>And that was the night it all started.</i>

07:07.760 --> 07:09.727
<i>And tonight, it all ends.</i>

07:09.795 --> 07:11.729
<i>Order is restored, as they say.</i>

07:11.797 --> 07:13.531
<i>More than restored... reborn.</i>

07:13.599 --> 07:16.601
<i>Now I have some true
sisters, some real family.</i>

07:16.669 --> 07:18.937
<i>The only dad I ever had was the asylum.</i>

07:19.004 --> 07:21.172
<i>My only family were those
nutburgers Gigi and Boone.</i>

07:21.240 --> 07:23.374
<i>But now I know who my real dad is</i>

07:23.442 --> 07:25.710
<i>and my real half-sister,
even if they don't.</i>

07:25.778 --> 07:27.212
<i>And the best part is</i>

07:27.279 --> 07:28.646
<i>that that isn't even the best part.</i>

07:28.714 --> 07:30.582
<i>Well, that isn't the best part either.</i>

07:30.649 --> 07:33.117
<i>The best part is who
isn't up here with us.</i>

07:33.185 --> 07:35.119
<i>Yep. No Chanels.</i>

07:35.187 --> 07:37.422
<i>I mean, someone had to
take all the blame.</i>

07:37.489 --> 07:38.923
<i>Right?</i>

07:41.100 --> 07:42.930
_

07:44.267 --> 07:46.769
HESTER: <i>You're probably
thinking, what kind of person</i>

07:46.837 --> 07:48.904
<i>could drive a six-inch stiletto
into her own eye socket?</i>

07:48.972 --> 07:50.072
Hester, it's gonna be
okay, it's gonna be okay.

07:50.140 --> 07:51.774
(whispers): Can we save the shoe?

07:51.842 --> 07:53.876
HESTER: <i>A person who did
her homework, that's who!</i>

07:55.946 --> 07:59.114
<i>First, I had to get an
X-ray of my own skull.</i>

07:59.182 --> 08:02.218
<i>Then, I had to calculate the
proper length of the heel,</i>

08:02.285 --> 08:03.752
<i>the angle of the insertion,</i>

08:03.820 --> 08:05.588
<i>with just the right amount of force</i>

08:05.655 --> 08:08.657
<i>to slip behind the eyeball
without damaging the socket.</i>

08:08.725 --> 08:10.659
<i>Also, it helps to be
completely frickin' insane.</i>

08:10.727 --> 08:12.194
(panting softly)

08:14.264 --> 08:15.931
<i>Because for a plan like this to work,</i>

08:15.999 --> 08:19.835
<i>you have to be willing
to totally commit.</i>

08:19.903 --> 08:21.504
(screams)

08:21.571 --> 08:23.672
<i>I mean, desperate times call
for desperate measures.</i>

08:23.740 --> 08:25.574
<i>This was the price I
had to pay if I wanted</i>

08:25.642 --> 08:28.410
<i>to get away with murder and
pin it all on someone else.</i>

08:28.478 --> 08:29.845
(whimpers)

08:29.913 --> 08:30.946
(gasps)

08:31.014 --> 08:32.780
(gasping)

08:32.849 --> 08:33.749
The Red Devil!

08:36.219 --> 08:39.755
<i>Because some people don't
deserve to just get murdered.</i>

08:39.823 --> 08:41.756
They need to be truly punished.

08:41.825 --> 08:42.957
I didn't do it, I swear!

08:43.025 --> 08:45.060
Oh, please, we all know
the guy from Nickelback

08:45.128 --> 08:47.229
did not, in fact, swipe
right on your profile.

08:47.297 --> 08:50.833
Uh, yes, he did, okay? Nickelback is in
town playing some kid's bat mitzvah.

08:50.901 --> 08:52.935
Please! It was clearly a ruse

08:53.003 --> 08:55.804
so you could sneak back into
the house and kill Number Six!

08:55.872 --> 08:57.606
I would never, Chanel!

08:57.674 --> 08:58.674
I'm one of the good guys!

08:58.742 --> 09:00.075
Look, I-I know,

09:00.143 --> 09:01.877
I know that I can be socially awkward

09:01.945 --> 09:04.079
and-and a little bit off-putting

09:04.147 --> 09:06.882
and that most people find it
very difficult to be around me,

09:06.950 --> 09:08.217
but you know me, Chanel.

09:08.285 --> 09:10.119
I'm not the killer.

09:10.186 --> 09:12.087
Um, excuse me?

09:12.155 --> 09:13.789
I think you're a serial killer

09:13.857 --> 09:15.324
because I know you, Number Five!

09:15.392 --> 09:16.425
You bite your own toenails.

09:16.493 --> 09:18.127
Okay, I am flexible.

09:18.194 --> 09:20.796
Why would I waste my money
buying toenail clippers

09:20.864 --> 09:23.065
when God already blessed
me with toenail clippers

09:23.133 --> 09:25.434
in the form of teeth in my mouth?!

09:25.502 --> 09:27.803
It's awfully convenient that
you're the one who noticed

09:27.871 --> 09:28.904
- Number Two's body went missing.
- (gasps)

09:28.972 --> 09:30.472
Maybe you knew it was gone

09:30.540 --> 09:32.441
'cause you'd already taken it
to the house on Shady Lane.

09:32.509 --> 09:34.810
Look, we should all just stay up

09:34.878 --> 09:37.279
and wait until Number Five
gets tired and passes out.

09:37.347 --> 09:39.548
She confesses all sorts of
crazy stuff in her sleep.

09:39.616 --> 09:42.017
She and I were roommates the first
year we lived in the house.

09:42.085 --> 09:43.819
I unlocked the brakes
on Grandma's wheelchair

09:43.887 --> 09:45.721
so that she would slide down
the driveway into the traffic.

09:45.789 --> 09:46.956
Shut up!

09:47.023 --> 09:48.724
Go to sleep!

09:48.792 --> 09:51.694
When I fart, I cup it in
my hand and smell it.

09:51.761 --> 09:54.363
Dear God, shut up!

09:54.431 --> 09:56.799
CHANEL: Wait a minute.
Everybody, shut up!

09:56.866 --> 09:58.167
I know what happened.

09:58.234 --> 09:59.568
You killed Number Two

09:59.636 --> 10:01.537
and confessed it in your
sleep to Roger and Dodger

10:01.605 --> 10:04.340
after a hot night of letting
them Eiffel Tower you.

10:04.407 --> 10:06.742
And once you knew that they both knew,

10:06.810 --> 10:08.243
you realized you'd have to kill them!

10:08.311 --> 10:09.712
Oh.

10:09.779 --> 10:11.880
Oh, I see where this is going.

10:11.948 --> 10:13.782
You're gonna try and pin
all of these murders on me

10:13.850 --> 10:15.351
so I spend the rest
of my life in prison.

10:15.418 --> 10:17.586
Oh, no, my friend.

10:17.654 --> 10:20.189
You... are going to the electric chair.

10:20.256 --> 10:22.758
No!

10:22.826 --> 10:24.927
Do they still use those?

10:24.995 --> 10:26.562
Uh-huh.

10:26.630 --> 10:27.596
Okay.

10:27.664 --> 10:30.599
Well, thank you for letting me know.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.368
Well, well, well.

10:32.435 --> 10:34.136
This just in.

10:34.204 --> 10:37.373
Police Chief Denise
Hemphill just got a call.

10:37.440 --> 10:40.109
A decomposing male body was found

10:40.176 --> 10:43.879
with rippling abs and
a possible gay face

10:43.947 --> 10:48.784
that appears to be a match
for one Boone Clemens.

10:48.852 --> 10:52.187
That's right, y'all! Hot damn, shazam!

10:52.255 --> 10:54.189
Boone is dead.

10:54.257 --> 10:56.759
Excuse me for a second
while I drop the mic.

10:56.826 --> 11:00.129
We already knew Boone was dead.
Pete admitted to killing him.

11:00.196 --> 11:02.031
Okay, well, excuse me

11:02.098 --> 11:04.233
for trying to reiterate the facts

11:04.300 --> 11:06.101
and get us all on the same page.

11:06.169 --> 11:09.938
I mean, after all, I am just the chief
of the whole damn police department.

11:10.006 --> 11:11.940
Okay, look, this is all so insane.

11:12.008 --> 11:15.210
Look, we can all freely admit
that Number Five is fairly odd,

11:15.278 --> 11:16.612
but she is not the killer.

11:16.680 --> 11:17.780
The killer is Hester.

11:17.847 --> 11:19.948
Yes, and the proof is in her files.

11:20.016 --> 11:21.417
(door closes)

11:23.520 --> 11:26.789
The only proof you need
is this hole in my head.

11:28.024 --> 11:29.358
Good news.

11:29.426 --> 11:33.429
Chanel #5 didn't insert the heel hard
enough to pierce my orbital socket.

11:33.496 --> 11:34.863
The doctors were able
to save my eyeball,

11:34.931 --> 11:36.832
and they said that I'm gonna
make a full recovery.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.034
No, that can't be true.
You're the killer!

11:39.102 --> 11:41.937
Your entire life story
is totally fabricated.

11:42.005 --> 11:45.874
Just look at her insane, obviously
made-up, high school transcript.

11:45.942 --> 11:47.676
I'm very embarrassed about that.

11:47.744 --> 11:50.679
Yes, it's true, I falsified
my high school transcripts,

11:50.747 --> 11:53.515
but only to cover up the fact
that I was homeschooled.

11:53.583 --> 11:54.883
- (gasps)
- Mm.

11:54.951 --> 11:56.318
I-I was afraid that
if people found out,

11:56.386 --> 11:57.820
they wouldn't ask me
to join a sorority.

11:57.887 --> 12:00.289
Liar! You are the baby in the bathtub.

12:00.356 --> 12:01.924
You look just like Boone.

12:01.991 --> 12:05.461
And Pete told us that your DNA
matched Boone and my dad.

12:05.528 --> 12:08.864
Are you talking about the same Pete who
admitted to being one of the killers?

12:08.932 --> 12:10.365
He's just making that all up

12:10.433 --> 12:13.669
to cover for his real partner
in crime, Chanel #5!

12:13.737 --> 12:14.703
No.

12:14.771 --> 12:16.705
Well, then how do you explain the fact

12:16.773 --> 12:20.109
that there's absolutely no records
on your parents anywhere?

12:20.176 --> 12:21.310
- (doorbell rings)
- CHANEL: Ugh!

12:21.377 --> 12:23.679
I think the answer to
that is at the door.

12:27.617 --> 12:28.550
What?

12:28.618 --> 12:30.152
(dog whimpers)

12:30.220 --> 12:32.054
- Sweetheart.
- Hester?

12:32.122 --> 12:33.822
Oh, sweetheart, are you okay?

12:33.890 --> 12:35.090
Stepfather.

12:35.158 --> 12:36.558
We came as soon as we heard.

12:36.626 --> 12:38.894
HESTER: Oh, Mother. Cuddlebear.

12:38.962 --> 12:42.097
Everyone, these are my
parents, Clark and Delight.

12:42.165 --> 12:46.201
Hester is our biological daughter.
She definitely was not adopted.

12:46.269 --> 12:48.103
(chuckles): I have the
stretch marks to prove it.

12:48.171 --> 12:50.539
That's right, we're
prepared to corroborate

12:50.607 --> 12:53.108
everything my stepdaughter,
Hester, has just said.

12:53.176 --> 12:54.710
Do I know you?

12:54.778 --> 12:58.447
Wait, hold on, there's no record
of Hester's parents anywhere.

12:58.515 --> 13:02.184
That's because, until recently, my
husband and I worked for the CIA.

13:02.252 --> 13:04.186
We were forced to
remain deep undercover

13:04.254 --> 13:07.823
to protect Hester and Cuddlebear
and the people who love them.

13:07.891 --> 13:09.391
Wait, I do know! I know
where I know you from.

13:09.459 --> 13:10.993
You're from that prostate commercial.

13:11.060 --> 13:12.928
Can you say that line I love so much?

13:12.996 --> 13:14.696
Uh...

13:14.764 --> 13:17.199
"Thanks, MaxFlow, my stream's
never been stronger."

13:17.267 --> 13:18.734
"Never been stronger," yes!
I love that line!

13:18.802 --> 13:21.737
Well, in order to not blow
their super-secret CIA covers,

13:21.805 --> 13:24.173
my parents sometimes work
as actors in commercials.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.307
Oh, yeah, yeah.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.775
Well, I want to talk to my parents,

13:26.843 --> 13:29.378
so they can explain to you how
I am not a serial killer,

13:29.445 --> 13:30.846
nor am I the baby in the bathtub.

13:30.914 --> 13:33.615
Don't worry, I already
called your parents.

13:33.683 --> 13:34.817
(doorbell rings)

13:34.884 --> 13:36.752
CHANEL: Ugh!

13:37.854 --> 13:39.488
Wha...?

13:40.623 --> 13:42.891
CHANEL #5: (gasps) Mom and Dad!

13:42.959 --> 13:45.394
Hi!

13:45.461 --> 13:48.964
Can you please tell everybody
how I wasn't adopted,

13:49.032 --> 13:51.133
nor am I a serial killer?

13:51.201 --> 13:54.603
So, we're not Chanel #5's real parents.

13:54.671 --> 13:56.438
A woman named Gigi gave her to us

13:56.506 --> 13:58.607
after a sizable stint in
a mental institution.

13:58.675 --> 13:59.541
What?!

13:59.609 --> 14:01.844
We took her in out of the
kindness of our hearts.

14:01.911 --> 14:03.245
And also for the tax deduction.

14:04.180 --> 14:05.914
That's not true!

14:05.982 --> 14:07.916
All Gigi asked was that
when the time came

14:07.984 --> 14:10.219
that we enroll our daughter
at Wallace University

14:10.286 --> 14:12.221
and encourage her to
pledge Kappa Kappa Tau.

14:12.288 --> 14:14.223
We tried to love her like our own,

14:14.290 --> 14:17.326
but, I mean... she's not great.

14:17.393 --> 14:19.561
And now that the truth is out
that she's probably a murderer,

14:19.629 --> 14:21.129
we don't want to have
anything to do with her.

14:21.197 --> 14:22.731
No!

14:22.799 --> 14:24.900
How could you do this to me?!

14:24.924 --> 14:26.769
_

14:26.803 --> 14:28.804
I have to be honest, we've
actually discussed doing

14:28.872 --> 14:30.772
exactly what you're proposing.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.075
As soon as she learned to
talk, I wanted to disown her.

14:33.142 --> 14:36.745
I mean, maybe she's the killer
on campus, maybe she's not,

14:36.813 --> 14:38.814
- but she probably is, right?
- Yeah.

14:38.882 --> 14:39.815
Yeah. I mean, she just sucks.

14:39.883 --> 14:40.849
Our daughter sucks.

14:41.951 --> 14:43.886
I can't believe what I'm hearing!

14:43.953 --> 14:45.320
Please tell them the truth.

14:45.388 --> 14:47.289
It is the truth, you frumpy monster.

14:47.357 --> 14:48.056
(gasps)

14:48.124 --> 14:50.492
The psychologists said you probably
wouldn't remember the asylum

14:50.560 --> 14:51.894
on account of it being so traumatic.

14:51.961 --> 14:54.897
Your mind filled in the
gaps with imagined memories

14:54.964 --> 14:57.799
- of growing up in our house.
- But, sweetie, you're toxic,

14:57.867 --> 14:59.668
and you're bumming us out,
so it's time for you to go.

14:59.736 --> 15:02.304
DENISE: Okay, okay, I
have heard enough.

15:02.372 --> 15:06.108
Now, I still believe that
Zayday Williams is the killer.

15:06.175 --> 15:07.809
Okay.

15:07.877 --> 15:10.245
But this, this is real suspicious.

15:11.381 --> 15:16.151
So, Chanel #5, you are under arrest.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.452
What?!

15:17.520 --> 15:18.854
You can't arrest me... don't you need,

15:18.922 --> 15:20.355
like, a warrant or
something from a judge?

15:20.423 --> 15:21.790
DENISE: What?!

15:21.858 --> 15:25.861
I'm the chief of the police department,
and I can arrest whoever I want.

15:25.929 --> 15:27.362
And, little girl, you,

15:27.430 --> 15:30.132
- you got the right to remain silent.
- (handcuffs click)

15:30.199 --> 15:32.834
And you got some other
rights that come after that,

15:32.902 --> 15:34.036
and I don't know what they are,

15:34.103 --> 15:36.338
'cause I don't remember
what I'm supposed to say

15:36.406 --> 15:38.707
after "You got the right to
remain silent," but come on!

15:38.775 --> 15:39.841
Wait, I'm not finished.

15:40.877 --> 15:42.811
She's not the only killer.

15:42.879 --> 15:46.748
You also need to arrest... Chanel #3!

15:49.829 --> 15:51.624
Wait, you think I'm the killer?

15:51.624 --> 15:54.225
I know for a fact that
you're working hand-in-hand

15:54.293 --> 15:56.461
with Chanel #5 and her evil
killing brother Boone,

15:56.886 --> 15:58.887
and that your first victim
was Deaf Taylor Swift.

15:59.558 --> 16:01.459
What? That's impossible.

16:01.527 --> 16:03.628
When the pledges were buried up
to their necks in the backyard,

16:03.696 --> 16:06.264
I was sipping banana daiquiris
at the White Stallion.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.433
Well, yeah, you came to the
White Stallion with us,

16:08.500 --> 16:10.168
but then you disappeared
as soon as we got there.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.603
Care to elaborate, Number Three?

16:11.670 --> 16:13.004
I can explain.

16:13.072 --> 16:16.708
<i>When I got to the bar, I realized
my stomach was really bothering me.</i>

16:16.775 --> 16:18.142
<i>I thought maybe someone had
put something in my drink</i>

16:18.210 --> 16:21.412
<i>because I was tting mad cramps, and
I knew it was gonna be trouble.</i>

16:21.480 --> 16:23.414
<i>I was past needing to go number two.</i>

16:23.482 --> 16:25.483
<i>I needed to go</i> number three.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.652
(gasping)

16:27.720 --> 16:30.588
<i>But the bathrooms at the White
Stallion are freakin' disgusting.</i>

16:30.656 --> 16:32.657
<i>There was no way I was gonna
lay down some pipe in there.</i>

16:32.725 --> 16:35.927
<i>So I went back to Kappa House and I
destroyed the bathroom upstairs.</i>

16:35.995 --> 16:36.861
But I didn't kill anyone.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.263
Hmm, so let me get this straight.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.265
You're accusing someone
here in Kappa House

16:40.332 --> 16:43.268
of putting laxatives in your cocktail?

16:43.335 --> 16:44.435
Messing with somebody's regularity?

16:44.503 --> 16:46.604
That's downright criminal.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.606
I just don't understand how
deep the hole's supposed to be.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.609
Whore deep! What kind
of a question is that?!

16:51.677 --> 16:52.610
(sighs)

16:52.678 --> 16:54.545
Useless.

16:54.613 --> 16:56.047
HESTER: <i>Hmm, but let's say</i>

16:56.115 --> 16:57.682
you aren't lying and that you didn't

16:57.750 --> 16:59.417
mow Deaf Taylor Swift's head off.

16:59.485 --> 17:03.321
I know for a fact that you
killed Predatory Lez.

17:03.389 --> 17:03.964
No, I didn't.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.714
You know, when you sent
her down there to die

17:05.758 --> 17:08.425
because you were too ashamed
of your feelings for her,

17:08.493 --> 17:10.094
I went down there to check on her,

17:10.162 --> 17:12.696
when I caught a glimpse of
someone running up the stairs,

17:12.765 --> 17:14.898
and they were wearing earmuffs!

17:14.967 --> 17:16.768
- You're lying!
- That's just what I saw.

17:16.835 --> 17:18.670
Well, just saying you saw
something isn't evidence.

17:18.737 --> 17:21.271
No, you right, it's not evidence.

17:21.339 --> 17:22.906
But it is suspicious.

17:22.974 --> 17:24.309
You know why?

17:24.376 --> 17:26.310
'Cause you the only one
in here wearing earmuffs!

17:26.377 --> 17:28.046
Yeah, I know.

17:28.113 --> 17:32.317
HESTER: Let's not forget the
most suspicious fact of all.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.618
You're Charles Manson's daughter.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.219
Uh, say what, now?!

17:35.287 --> 17:37.922
And you have a shoebox
full of letters from him

17:37.990 --> 17:41.292
giving you advice on how
to kill your friends.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.794
Wait, Number Three, is that true?

17:42.861 --> 17:44.295
I can explain.

17:44.363 --> 17:47.598
Yes, I've become pen pals with my
biological father, Charles Manson.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.500
I wanted my real dad to help me

17:49.568 --> 17:51.502
with some growing-up stuff,
like how to French-kiss a boy

17:51.570 --> 17:54.439
or how to know when I've met Mr.
or Miss Right.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.474
But when he writes back,
his advice is always,

17:56.542 --> 17:58.309
"Maybe you should murder some
of your sorority sisters."

17:58.377 --> 17:59.644
HESTER: Why don't you go
ahead and read us one?

17:59.712 --> 18:00.978
Mm-hmm.

18:01.046 --> 18:02.380
"Precious daughter,

18:02.448 --> 18:04.916
"I'm sorry I don't know anything
about yeast infections,

18:04.983 --> 18:06.417
"but I did see an incredible
story on the news

18:06.485 --> 18:08.553
about, uh, a pizza guy who
had a bomb strapped to him."

18:08.620 --> 18:09.721
What?

18:09.788 --> 18:11.289
"I'm totes sad that I can't order

18:11.357 --> 18:13.324
"a pizza to the penitentiary and
strap a bomb to the pizza guy,

18:13.392 --> 18:15.593
but that doesn't mean y-you can't."

18:16.395 --> 18:19.964
Oh, man. That's real suspicious.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.399
I-I'm telling you, I
didn't kill anybody.

18:21.467 --> 18:22.767
Well, maybe <i>you</i> didn't,

18:22.835 --> 18:24.335
but your split personality did.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.938
I have a signed letter here
from your psychiatrist.

18:27.005 --> 18:28.339
I've never been to a psychiatrist.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.108
Well, your split personality has.

18:30.175 --> 18:31.309
It says right here.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.710
"Dear Hester,

18:32.778 --> 18:37.148
"yes, I treated Chanel #3 for
split personality disorder

18:37.216 --> 18:39.317
"over the course of about eight months.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.953
"She showed up at my office
in a leather jacket,

18:42.020 --> 18:44.455
"claiming her name was Dirty Helen

18:44.523 --> 18:46.124
"and that she was the leader

18:46.191 --> 18:48.526
- "of a notorious West Coast biker gang.
- (gasps)

18:48.594 --> 18:50.695
"Dirty Helen made threats
against my family,

18:50.763 --> 18:54.932
"and I was forced to move my
practice out of the country.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.435
Signed, Dr. Adam Berkel, MD."

18:57.503 --> 18:59.237
Oh, my God, so you're saying

18:59.304 --> 19:01.439
that Dirty Helen could have
killed Sam and Deaf Taylor Swift

19:01.507 --> 19:04.275
and I would have no memory of killing
them or receiving treatment?

19:04.343 --> 19:05.843
That's exactly how a
split personality works.

19:05.911 --> 19:08.846
Chanel #5 admitted to you that
she was the baby in the bathtub,

19:08.914 --> 19:12.383
and then she convinced your split
personality to join her on a killing spree.

19:12.451 --> 19:15.386
So, Dirty Helen, I'm the
other baby in the bathtub,

19:15.454 --> 19:17.522
and I want you to join
my killing spree.

19:17.589 --> 19:20.391
Okay, cool. But let's
not tell Chanel #3.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.493
CHANEL #5: <i>This conversation
</i> never took place!

19:22.561 --> 19:24.729
Yeah, but if it did,
I wouldn't remember

19:24.797 --> 19:27.465
'cause you were talking to my evil
split personality, Dirty Helen.

19:27.533 --> 19:30.668
Okay, Chanel #3, you are under arrest.

19:31.603 --> 19:32.804
CHANEL #3: Sam, wherever you are,

19:32.871 --> 19:35.706
I'm so sorry my split
personality murdered you!

19:35.774 --> 19:37.041
- (handcuffs click)
- Wait!

19:37.109 --> 19:39.410
There's someone else you
need to arrest, too.

19:39.478 --> 19:41.379
Chanel Oberlin!

19:45.613 --> 19:47.687
- What?
- Excuse me.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.656
Uh, if you're gonna just
continue to accuse everyone,

19:50.724 --> 19:51.857
could we at least sit down?

19:51.925 --> 19:54.093
Liam, we're gonna lose our reservation.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.095
Uh, it's all really interesting though.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.097
I have proof that you, Chanel Oberlin,

19:58.164 --> 20:00.499
entered a home improvement
store two months ago

20:00.567 --> 20:02.501
and purchased the following items...

20:02.569 --> 20:04.903
<i>A garden shear, a riding
mower, three chain saws,</i>

20:04.971 --> 20:08.507
<i>a pneumatic nail gun, two
axes, and a crossbow.</i>

20:08.575 --> 20:10.509
Okay, first of all,

20:10.577 --> 20:12.511
I was the one who was
shot with the crossbow!

20:12.579 --> 20:15.347
And also they don't sell crossbows
at home improvement centers!

20:15.415 --> 20:18.717
Oh, Chanel, the security
footage begs to differ.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.624
<i>It's also stated right here,</i>

20:25.692 --> 20:29.128
<i>in your Diners Club monthly statement.</i>

20:29.195 --> 20:30.496
I'll take that, too.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.830
What?!

20:31.898 --> 20:33.565
I don't have a Diners Club card!

20:33.633 --> 20:35.868
Is Diners Club still even a thing?

20:35.935 --> 20:38.871
- I still keep one in my wallet for backup.
- Mm.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.907
I don't know why I'm the one who
always has to bring this up,

20:41.975 --> 20:45.677
but we did all watch Chanel burn Ms.
Bean's face off.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.915
For the <i>last</i> time,

20:49.983 --> 20:52.050
that was a Hell Week prank gone wrong!

20:52.118 --> 20:53.786
I didn't know the oil was boiling!

20:53.853 --> 20:55.053
Someone turned on that deep fryer!

20:56.222 --> 20:58.157
(deep fryer whirring)

21:01.394 --> 21:02.694
- I don't know.
- CHANEL #3: And I did just

21:02.762 --> 21:04.163
watch you try to murder Melanie Dorkus

21:04.230 --> 21:05.531
with a pair of scissors
earlier this afternoon.

21:05.598 --> 21:09.501
I only did that because I
thought she was the killer!

21:09.569 --> 21:11.537
I mean, I'm telling you,
I'm not the Red Devil!

21:13.807 --> 21:16.408
You bitch. What is your game here?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.710
I mean, I'm all for Number
Five being the killer.

21:18.778 --> 21:23.415
She's a weird psychopath who would look
like Boone's homely, bloated sister

21:23.483 --> 21:25.717
if she let her horrible
black roots grow out.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.553
She probably <i>is</i> the
baby in the bathtub.

21:27.620 --> 21:31.623
And I am 100% not
surprised that Chanel #3

21:31.691 --> 21:33.091
is also a psycho with
a split personality,

21:33.159 --> 21:36.361
who is helping Number
Five murder everybody!

21:36.429 --> 21:39.464
But why me?! I mean, I am a
pillar of this community.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.733
I'm also already hot and rich.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.569
What would I have to
gain by hatching a plan

21:43.636 --> 21:45.704
to knock off a bunch of
nameless dumb whores?

21:45.772 --> 21:47.739
I don't think that you did
hatch the plan, Chanel.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.108
But I think that once the
murders started happening,

21:50.176 --> 21:52.511
you saw it as the perfect
opportunity to knock off

21:52.579 --> 21:54.947
the pledges that you thought
would ruin Kappa Kappa Tau.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.050
With each murdered pledge,
this sorority house

21:58.117 --> 22:02.354
got closer to being the Kappa Tau
that you always intended it to be!

22:02.422 --> 22:03.589
Oh, yeah?

22:03.656 --> 22:06.925
Well, then why didn't I kill the
two pledges I actually hate...

22:06.993 --> 22:08.727
dumb-ass Grace and stupid Zayday?

22:08.795 --> 22:10.863
Plausible deniability!
You knew by keeping

22:10.930 --> 22:13.599
these two alive that it would
keep everyone off your scent.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.700
No!

22:14.767 --> 22:16.568
Come on, Cyclops.

22:16.636 --> 22:20.272
In the sleuthing business, that's
what we call ice-cold logic.

22:20.340 --> 22:23.709
It's obvious when you
look at it, Chanel,

22:23.776 --> 22:26.178
that everything that's
happened on this campus so far

22:26.246 --> 22:29.581
is just the logical next step
for sororities everywhere.

22:29.649 --> 22:33.085
Because what's murder if not the most
perfect, ultimate form of hazing?

22:33.152 --> 22:36.822
What better way for you to knock
off everyone that you hate,

22:36.890 --> 22:38.957
because they're different
from you or not as popular

22:39.025 --> 22:42.160
or not as pretty, than to
murder them one by one?!

22:43.696 --> 22:44.663
(Chanels gasping)

22:47.600 --> 22:49.034
Congratulations, Chanel.

22:50.337 --> 22:53.605
You almost got the Kappa House
that you always dreamed of.

22:53.673 --> 22:58.477
DENISE: This is what I like to
call first-class entertainment.

22:58.544 --> 22:59.811
And I'd love nothing more

22:59.879 --> 23:01.914
than to stand around
here watching you all

23:01.981 --> 23:06.184
descend into a nightmare of
accusation and recrimination.

23:06.252 --> 23:09.821
But I am here to represent the law.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.458
And unfortunately for
you, Chanel Oberlin...

23:13.526 --> 23:17.429
aka one of the murderers...
you are under arrest.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.797
You'll never take me alive!

23:19.866 --> 23:24.002
Time to call in the po-po. The chief
of police is requesting backup.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.305
â™ª We all fall down... â™ª

23:26.372 --> 23:28.540
(Chanels screaming)

23:28.608 --> 23:32.678
â™ª Like toy soldiers â™ª

23:38.651 --> 23:39.751
â™ª It wasn't my intention... â™ª

23:39.819 --> 23:43.689
- GRACE: Are these strippers?
- They used to be strippers, okay?

23:43.756 --> 23:49.261
But, uh, super-sleuthing Chief of Police
Denise Hemphill had 'em deputized.

23:49.329 --> 23:50.896
Get 'em, boys!

23:50.964 --> 23:52.497
(Chanels continue screaming)

23:52.565 --> 23:56.034
â™ª Takes the fall â™ª

23:56.102 --> 23:59.571
â™ª Won't you come out and play with me â™ª

23:59.639 --> 24:01.707
â™ª Step by step â™ª

24:01.774 --> 24:03.508
â™ª Heart to heart â™ª

24:03.576 --> 24:04.977
â™ª Left, right, left â™ª

24:05.044 --> 24:07.212
â™ª We all fall down... â™ª

24:07.280 --> 24:10.716
You rich, dumb hos are going downtown!

24:10.783 --> 24:12.150
Get 'em out of here!

24:12.218 --> 24:14.720
You can't! Wait, no!

24:14.787 --> 24:16.088
(screaming)

24:16.155 --> 24:18.090
You can't! Wait, no, no!

24:18.157 --> 24:20.192
(screaming continues)

24:20.259 --> 24:23.395
I still gots my eye on
you, Zayday Williams!

24:24.630 --> 24:29.401
â™ª For toy soldiers â™ª

24:32.415 --> 24:34.235
_

24:34.746 --> 24:37.115
MUNSCH: <i>What a difference
five months can make.</i>

24:37.261 --> 24:39.195
<i>Order on campus was restored.</i>

24:39.594 --> 24:41.595
<i>And when the Chanels were denied bail</i>

24:41.663 --> 24:44.197
<i>and sent to jail awaiting trial...</i>

24:44.265 --> 24:45.599
(gavel banging)

24:45.667 --> 24:48.602
I am holding you in contempt of court.

24:48.670 --> 24:50.303
Bail is revoked!

24:50.371 --> 24:52.439
MUNSCH: <i>...justice had been served.</i>

24:52.507 --> 24:54.641
<i>Chad Radwell and Denise Hemphill</i>

24:54.709 --> 24:56.943
<i>continued their torrid love affair.</i>

24:57.011 --> 24:59.212
<i>It ceased to be just a booty call.</i>

24:59.280 --> 25:02.182
<i>When they broke up, he was devastated.</i>

25:02.250 --> 25:03.383
I'm sorry!

25:03.451 --> 25:05.185
I just don't understand
how you just end it.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.487
Because we're chasing waterfalls!

25:07.555 --> 25:10.924
We got to stick to the rivers
and the lakes that we used to!

25:10.992 --> 25:13.427
I thought we were in the marriage zone.

25:13.494 --> 25:16.063
I don't have a choice is
what I'm telling you.

25:16.130 --> 25:18.198
I got to be in Quantico tomorrow.

25:18.266 --> 25:21.168
I know you need me.
You need all of this.

25:21.235 --> 25:24.204
- But the FBI needs me more.
- The FBI is not gonna have that.

25:24.272 --> 25:25.405
That's mine!

25:26.340 --> 25:28.408
- Denise, you hurt me real bad.
- Don't do that.

25:28.476 --> 25:31.411
Wait, wait! No, no! Baby, please!

25:31.479 --> 25:32.879
Don't let it end like this.

25:34.248 --> 25:35.348
Don't do that to us.

25:35.416 --> 25:38.418
Come on. Come on, baby.

25:38.486 --> 25:40.287
â™ª Don't go chasing waterfalls... â™ª

25:40.354 --> 25:42.589
(sighs, grunts)

25:42.657 --> 25:44.324
â™ª Please stick to the rivers... â™ª

25:44.392 --> 25:46.560
Damn it, Denise.

25:46.627 --> 25:48.495
It was never gonna work out between us.

25:48.563 --> 25:51.264
We got too close to the sun, baby.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.433
We shined too bright.

25:53.501 --> 25:56.369
I promise I will never bang
anyone the way I banged you.

25:56.437 --> 25:58.004
Boy, you gonna make me cry!

25:58.072 --> 26:01.041
â™ª Don't go chasing waterfalls... â™ª

26:01.109 --> 26:02.342
(both moaning)

26:02.410 --> 26:04.244
â™ª Please stick to the rivers â™ª

26:04.312 --> 26:06.079
â™ª And the lakes that
you're used to... â™ª

26:06.147 --> 26:07.614
Go.

26:07.682 --> 26:09.015
Just go!

26:09.083 --> 26:11.451
You don't want to look back at it?

26:11.519 --> 26:13.086
One more time?

26:13.154 --> 26:17.257
â™ª But I think you're
moving too fast... â™ª

26:17.325 --> 26:19.092
Go!

26:19.160 --> 26:20.460
(crying)

26:21.562 --> 26:24.097
Press outlets of the world,

26:24.165 --> 26:25.999
on behalf of all the
Dickie Dollar Scholars

26:26.067 --> 26:28.468
who are no longer with us... (sighs)

26:28.536 --> 26:32.005
I would like to announce
the formation of...

26:32.073 --> 26:33.440
The Dickie Dollar Earl Grey

26:33.508 --> 26:35.609
Roger Dodger Caulfield
Charitable Foundation,

26:35.676 --> 26:39.246
or the DDEGRDCCF.

26:40.414 --> 26:42.249
From henceforth, all proceeds

26:42.316 --> 26:43.884
from every Dollar Scholar kegger,

26:43.951 --> 26:47.387
wet T-shirt contest, coed
mud wrestling tournament

26:47.455 --> 26:48.989
and Jell-O shot gavage

26:49.056 --> 26:51.391
will go... that's right...

26:51.459 --> 26:53.226
to charity.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.163
What's up?

26:56.230 --> 26:59.332
What charity will the Dollar
Scholars be pledging to support?

26:59.400 --> 27:03.403
What do you mean, "what charity"?
Just charity.

27:03.471 --> 27:04.938
All proceeds will go to charity.

27:05.006 --> 27:07.440
Yes, uh, but which charity?

27:07.508 --> 27:11.244
Uh... I-I don't know.

27:11.312 --> 27:13.446
- All of them?
- (reporters murmuring)

27:13.514 --> 27:15.682
Okay, you know, I'm not a big
fan of gotcha questions, dude!

27:15.750 --> 27:17.684
My friends are dead!
I have nothing left!

27:17.752 --> 27:19.486
Nothing!

27:19.554 --> 27:20.954
Next question.

27:21.022 --> 27:25.992
MUNSCH: <i>As for me, I wrote up a quick
book and became a media sensation.</i>

27:26.060 --> 27:28.495
<i>I was on the cover of Time, Newsweek</i>

27:28.563 --> 27:30.530
<i>and</i> Men's Health.

27:30.598 --> 27:32.299
<i>Well, I didn't write it.</i>

27:32.366 --> 27:33.967
<i>I had a ghostwriter do it.</i>

27:34.035 --> 27:35.335
Okay, well, there you go.

27:35.403 --> 27:39.139
Dean Munsch, your book is
an absolute revelation.

27:39.207 --> 27:41.408
Is there any way you could
sum up your philosophy

27:41.475 --> 27:44.544
on new new feminism
in just a few words?

27:44.612 --> 27:46.513
Um...

27:46.581 --> 27:50.517
if feminism was about demanding
equal treatment for women,

27:50.585 --> 27:52.953
and new feminism was saying

27:53.020 --> 27:56.623
that men and women are integral
complements to one another,

27:56.691 --> 28:00.527
then I guess we could sum
up, uh, new new feminism

28:00.595 --> 28:03.663
really in three simple words...

28:03.731 --> 28:06.032
Women are better.

28:06.100 --> 28:07.033
(laughter)

28:07.101 --> 28:09.970
I mean, the proof... it's
right in front of us.

28:10.037 --> 28:12.405
If you think about all
of human history,

28:12.473 --> 28:15.542
add up the wars and the genocide,

28:15.610 --> 28:18.078
all the oppression, the
violence, the exploitation,

28:18.145 --> 28:22.415
the degradation of the human spirit,

28:22.483 --> 28:24.885
what do all those
things have in common?

28:26.454 --> 28:27.854
Dudes.

28:27.922 --> 28:29.856
They have dudes in common, right?

28:29.924 --> 28:30.957
Yeah.

28:31.025 --> 28:36.096
So maybe, just maybe, it's not just
places like Wallace University

28:36.163 --> 28:38.365
that are better off
with a woman in charge.

28:38.432 --> 28:42.202
Maybe we'd be better off
if a woman was charge...

28:42.270 --> 28:43.270
ALL: Everywhere!

28:43.337 --> 28:44.971
Exactly!

28:45.039 --> 28:47.374
(whooping, cheering)

28:47.441 --> 28:50.877
Thank you. Thank you.

28:50.945 --> 28:55.849
<i>The culture at this university
has been changed for the better.</i>

28:55.917 --> 28:58.184
<i>It's true, a lot of people had to die</i>

28:58.252 --> 29:01.855
<i>to make that happen, but I
often catch myself thinking,</i>

29:01.923 --> 29:05.058
<i>"You know what? Maybe it was worth it."</i>

29:05.082 --> 29:10.934
_

29:11.499 --> 29:14.234
Girls, I am thrilled

29:14.302 --> 29:15.635
that you've taken the initiative

29:15.703 --> 29:18.305
to do the upkeep for our new memorial.

29:18.372 --> 29:20.807
Well, we decided it was
the least Kappa could do.

29:20.875 --> 29:23.443
Considering Kappa is kind of
the reason they're all dead.

29:23.511 --> 29:24.811
Isn't it so beautiful?

29:24.879 --> 29:26.313
And so nice of the Radwells

29:26.380 --> 29:28.448
to donate the money to commission it

29:28.516 --> 29:29.983
and have it built so quickly?

29:30.051 --> 29:34.788
Yeah, I'm-I'm not sure I'm
fully committed to the design.

29:34.855 --> 29:38.325
Oh, and I should've never let
Chad write the inscription.

29:38.392 --> 29:41.328
But I suppose money still talks.

29:41.395 --> 29:43.697
Yeah, well, we've got to get going

29:43.764 --> 29:46.099
because I am planning a
"get your yummies in

29:46.167 --> 29:47.600
and your feelings out" baking
party at the house tonight.

29:47.668 --> 29:49.302
We're gonna make cookies and brownies,

29:49.370 --> 29:51.604
and eat them while we
talk about our feelings.

29:51.672 --> 29:54.474
Hester, you think you can
finish up the rest of this?

29:54.542 --> 29:55.875
Make sure my boy Earl
gets some extra love.

29:55.943 --> 29:57.944
Yeah.

29:59.046 --> 30:02.549
- Well, that just sounds awful.
- I don't know.

30:02.616 --> 30:04.351
I for one prefer the
saccharine banality of life

30:04.418 --> 30:06.519
under Grace and Zayday
to the toxic sludge

30:06.587 --> 30:09.990
the Chanels force-fed us every
day like we were pÃ¢tÃ©d geese.

30:10.057 --> 30:11.925
Yeah, I suppose I agree.

30:11.993 --> 30:15.729
But what happened here to those
poor kids and the others was...

30:15.796 --> 30:17.731
was truly awful.

30:17.798 --> 30:19.432
I mean, it was an American tragedy.

30:20.835 --> 30:23.770
At least some good came
out of all of that evil.

30:23.838 --> 30:25.405
Oh, more than some, Dean.

30:25.473 --> 30:28.541
I-I read your best-selling <i>New
York Times</i> book three times.

30:28.609 --> 30:31.544
Th-These kids were martyrs
for a much bigger cause.

30:36.050 --> 30:39.619
I know it was you, Hester.

30:39.687 --> 30:41.388
I remember that little girl's face

30:41.455 --> 30:43.056
in the bathroom that night.

30:45.459 --> 30:47.394
Burned into my memory,

30:47.461 --> 30:50.563
like Joe Theismann's injury
and <i>Two Girls One Cup.</i>

30:50.631 --> 30:55.268
I remember every detail
of her little face.

30:55.336 --> 30:58.938
And I certainly would know what
she would look like all grown up.

31:01.475 --> 31:04.677
It's not my fault that all
of that happened to me.

31:04.745 --> 31:06.679
You see how awesome Wes is.

31:08.298 --> 31:09.281
He would've been my dad.

31:10.484 --> 31:11.918
I would've had a good life.

31:11.986 --> 31:13.453
Maybe if I would've had a real dad,

31:13.521 --> 31:15.321
my brother wouldn't have
turned into such a douche.

31:15.389 --> 31:18.558
Maybe family trips to ski in
Innsbruck or to Williamstown to see

31:18.626 --> 31:20.760
Tim Daly in <i>Death of a
Salesman would've turned me</i>

31:20.828 --> 31:23.396
into a much more sane young woman.

31:23.464 --> 31:24.898
But that didn't happen.

31:24.965 --> 31:26.399
And I can't be blamed

31:26.467 --> 31:28.568
for the painful circumstances
of my upbringing.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.904
No, but those kids died.

31:30.971 --> 31:34.307
They're dead. And that is your fault.

31:34.375 --> 31:36.009
I didn't kill any of these kids.

31:36.077 --> 31:38.278
Except for Pete, but he's a
killer, so that's allowed.

31:38.345 --> 31:39.913
By the state, Hester.

31:40.743 --> 31:43.550
After a trial and lengthy appeals

31:43.617 --> 31:45.819
and using drugs that
are mostly painless.

31:45.886 --> 31:47.787
It all worked out, Dean.

31:47.855 --> 31:49.322
And I'm never gonna kill again.

31:49.390 --> 31:50.824
As long as I'm not texting and driving.

31:51.527 --> 31:54.160
Everyone got what they wanted.

31:54.603 --> 31:57.430
And even if the Chanels didn't
actually kill any of these people,

31:57.498 --> 31:59.666
they perpetuated the
system that created me

31:59.733 --> 32:02.669
and my brother, Pete and Gigi.

32:02.736 --> 32:05.905
So if anyone should pay for
this, it should be them.

32:05.973 --> 32:08.408
I also have a conscience,

32:08.476 --> 32:12.345
and a responsibility to
all those dead kids,

32:12.413 --> 32:16.282
that their killer be
brought to justice.

32:16.350 --> 32:19.986
So I am gonna turn you in, Hester.

32:22.123 --> 32:24.357
Then I'm gonna turn you in,

32:24.425 --> 32:27.360
for covering up the murder of my mother

32:27.428 --> 32:29.729
and killing your ex-husband.

32:31.866 --> 32:34.734
(whispers): Or we could
just say we're good...

32:34.802 --> 32:35.969
and move on.

32:37.638 --> 32:41.741
To our very happy and successful

32:41.809 --> 32:43.877
best-selling lives.

32:49.519 --> 32:51.145
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

32:52.076 --> 32:54.621
- Take care.
- You, too. See ya.

33:03.521 --> 33:05.288
This is the "Sophia Doyle

33:05.356 --> 33:08.124
I Just Had a Baby and Don't Know
What to Do" hotline center.

33:08.192 --> 33:11.127
Now, any girl in the situation
that Sophia found herself in

33:11.195 --> 33:13.329
in that bathtub 20 years
ago has a lifeline.

33:13.397 --> 33:14.798
Someone she can call for help.

33:14.865 --> 33:17.467
I mean, of course, the girls who
find her can also call as well.

33:17.535 --> 33:18.902
We just want to make sure

33:18.969 --> 33:21.604
that nothing like this ever
happens on campus again.

33:21.672 --> 33:22.906
Yeah.

33:22.973 --> 33:25.709
Well, it certainly is specific.

33:25.776 --> 33:26.710
Yeah.

33:26.777 --> 33:28.278
How's it going so far?

33:28.345 --> 33:29.612
Um...

33:29.680 --> 33:31.581
not a lot of activity yet.

33:31.649 --> 33:34.384
- Right.
- Yeah.

33:34.452 --> 33:36.119
Well, you know, with all the changes

33:36.187 --> 33:38.288
that you guys have facilitated
all over the campus,

33:38.355 --> 33:42.592
maybe the next girl who has surprise twins
at a party won't have to call for help.

33:42.660 --> 33:45.528
Her friends will just now know
not to let her bleed to death,

33:45.596 --> 33:47.397
because it's the right thing to do.

33:47.465 --> 33:49.132
(sighs softly)

33:49.200 --> 33:51.134
Hey.

33:51.202 --> 33:53.236
Um, I'm really proud of you, Gracie.

33:55.272 --> 33:56.606
I-I want to give you a present.

33:56.674 --> 33:58.074
Something to acknowledge, you know,

33:58.142 --> 33:59.542
all the hard work that
you've done this year.

33:59.610 --> 34:01.611
Wait, Dad.

34:01.679 --> 34:03.546
Are you getting me a car?

34:03.614 --> 34:05.515
What? No.

34:05.583 --> 34:06.616
No.

34:06.684 --> 34:07.617
No, what-what...

34:07.685 --> 34:08.784
are you out of your mind?

34:08.853 --> 34:10.453
No. No. Trust.

34:10.521 --> 34:12.856
Trust, Gracie. I-I'm
giving you my trust.

34:12.922 --> 34:13.956
Oh.

34:14.024 --> 34:16.426
Oh, well, that's cool, too.

34:16.494 --> 34:17.527
Yeah.

34:17.594 --> 34:19.862
You know, I-I just, I-I never...

34:19.929 --> 34:22.599
I never actually gave you the
chance to matriculate here.

34:22.666 --> 34:24.801
I mean, as a student,
sure, but not as a woman.

34:24.869 --> 34:27.270
I mean, I was stalking you
outside of the sorority house,

34:27.338 --> 34:30.607
I got a job in the department
so I could keep my eye on you.

34:30.674 --> 34:34.077
And I never really trusted you
to take care of yourself.

34:34.145 --> 34:38.614
Well, clearly, I was wrong about that.

34:38.681 --> 34:41.751
- So does this mean you're leaving?
- Well, Dean Munsch, um...

34:41.819 --> 34:43.018
(laughs)

34:43.087 --> 34:44.654
...Cathy, uh...

34:44.722 --> 34:46.589
I can't stop calling her
that, especially because

34:46.657 --> 34:48.690
she likes me to call her
"Dean Munsch" in bed.

34:48.759 --> 34:52.061
Uh, anyway, Cathy and I, we're going
to Napa for a couple of weeks.

34:52.129 --> 34:54.097
We're gonna, we're gonna
suck down some deep cabs,

34:54.165 --> 34:57.100
eat some rich blues and...
well, I don't know,

34:57.168 --> 34:59.469
pretend to make, uh, a lot of babies.

34:59.537 --> 35:01.104
- (chuckles)
- Mm.

35:03.207 --> 35:05.909
I think you need your space.
You've earned it.

35:05.976 --> 35:07.710
I love you, Dad.

35:10.714 --> 35:12.682
Should we do one of our
counting good-byes?

35:12.750 --> 35:14.818
No, that's just for sad good-byes.

35:14.885 --> 35:16.519
Okay.

35:16.587 --> 35:17.687
One, two, three.

35:17.755 --> 35:20.023
- One, two, three.
- Dad...

35:22.726 --> 35:23.693
(sighs)

35:23.761 --> 35:25.461
BAILIFF: <i>All rise.</i>

35:29.500 --> 35:30.667
Be seated.

35:31.769 --> 35:34.337
JUDGE: Has the jury reached a verdict?

35:34.405 --> 35:35.338
We have, Your Honor.

35:35.406 --> 35:38.908
We, the jury, find the defendants...

35:38.976 --> 35:40.844
Objection!

35:40.911 --> 35:42.712
There is no more objections.
The trial is over.

35:42.780 --> 35:46.316
- What? When did that happen?
- You were asleep.

35:46.383 --> 35:48.651
Judge Joe Brown, we, the Chanels,

35:48.719 --> 35:51.321
hereby declare this trial a farce.

35:51.388 --> 35:56.960
I was under the impression that I had the
inalienable right to a jury of my peers.

35:57.027 --> 35:58.294
Look at these hippos.

35:58.362 --> 36:01.130
These are not my peers.

36:01.198 --> 36:03.666
I'm a hot, rich, skinny
chick, which makes me

36:03.734 --> 36:06.469
entitled to a jury of
hot, rich, skinny chicks

36:06.537 --> 36:07.737
to see how awesome I am

36:07.805 --> 36:12.008
and to see that the three
of us are innocent!

36:12.076 --> 36:13.343
Your-Your Honor!

36:13.410 --> 36:15.011
We, the jury,

36:15.079 --> 36:20.383
find that the defendants are
guilty on all 47 counts.

36:20.451 --> 36:21.651
(gallery murmuring)

36:21.719 --> 36:22.886
(shrieks)

36:24.588 --> 36:26.522
(shrieking, gavel pounding)

36:26.590 --> 36:27.590
Order in the court!

36:27.658 --> 36:28.691
- Deal with that.
- Order.

36:28.759 --> 36:31.427
This is a travesty, Judge Mathis.

36:31.495 --> 36:33.596
This is a kangaroo court.

36:33.664 --> 36:36.599
And I am choosing to
ignore this verdict.

36:36.667 --> 36:38.201
What? You can't ignore the verdict.

36:38.269 --> 36:39.469
What verdict?

36:39.536 --> 36:41.070
See, this is me ignoring the verdict.

36:41.138 --> 36:43.973
For, like, the millionth time,

36:44.041 --> 36:46.409
my dad is super gross rich.

36:46.477 --> 36:47.810
Like, disgusting rich.

36:47.878 --> 36:50.380
He'll have me out of prison in no time.

36:50.447 --> 36:51.981
Chanel, your parents abandoned you.

36:52.049 --> 36:54.584
They legally disowned
you three weeks ago

36:54.652 --> 36:57.420
and filed an amicus brief
with the prosecution,

36:57.488 --> 37:00.023
stating that they think that
you are a serial killer.

37:00.090 --> 37:02.158
They also want to sue you for the time

37:02.226 --> 37:04.027
that you drove your Range
Rover into their living room

37:04.094 --> 37:06.496
because you didn't want to walk
all the way up the driveway.

37:06.563 --> 37:08.431
(choked up): It is
such a long driveway.

37:08.499 --> 37:11.868
Don't worry, Ms. Oberlin. You
ladies are not going to prison.

37:11.936 --> 37:13.903
Thank you. (Chuckles)

37:13.971 --> 37:16.105
You're going to an asylum.

37:16.173 --> 37:17.307
What?!

37:17.374 --> 37:19.309
(gallery applauding)

37:19.376 --> 37:22.712
You know, you three are
the worst human beings

37:22.780 --> 37:24.647
that I have ever encountered.

37:24.715 --> 37:28.785
You have absolutely no regard
for anyone but yourselves.

37:28.852 --> 37:30.453
You're rude, entitled,

37:30.521 --> 37:33.823
narcissistic, racist and insane.

37:33.891 --> 37:38.428
You elected to represent yourselves
in a capital murder case,

37:38.495 --> 37:41.464
despite lacking even a basic
understanding of the law.

37:41.532 --> 37:45.802
And then, you-you mostly slept
through your own trial.

37:45.869 --> 37:46.703
That's crazy.

37:46.770 --> 37:50.440
Your entire defense consisted
of you screaming at the jury

37:50.507 --> 37:51.808
that you didn't kill anybody

37:51.875 --> 37:53.443
and then threatening to kill them

37:53.510 --> 37:54.711
if they found you guilty.

37:54.778 --> 37:57.747
That is crazy behavior.

37:57.815 --> 37:59.749
Chanel, you're crazy!

37:59.817 --> 38:01.617
Ladies, please stand.

38:01.685 --> 38:03.252
(sighs)

38:03.320 --> 38:04.487
Stand up!

38:04.555 --> 38:06.723
(groans)

38:06.790 --> 38:09.125
JUDGE: Chanel Oberlin, Sadie Swenson,

38:09.193 --> 38:10.126
Libby Putney...

38:10.194 --> 38:11.894
(Chanel laughs)

38:11.962 --> 38:14.664
I'm sorry, I keep forgetting
your real name is Libby Putney.

38:14.732 --> 38:20.843
JUDGE: I sentence you to life in prison
at the Palmer Asylum for the Insane!

38:21.238 --> 38:22.472
(gallery cheering)

38:22.539 --> 38:24.173
(gavel banging)

38:24.241 --> 38:25.408
Court is adjourned.

38:25.476 --> 38:28.378
CHANEL: <i>It was at the very
moment I had an epiphany.</i>

38:28.445 --> 38:30.113
<i>Maybe he had a point.</i>

38:30.180 --> 38:32.348
<i>Maybe we were sociopaths.</i>

38:32.416 --> 38:35.385
<i>Maybe we never cared about
anyone other than ourselves.</i>

38:35.452 --> 38:37.253
<i>Maybe we were crazy,</i>

38:37.321 --> 38:38.788
<i>but we didn't know it because
we made Kappa House crazy,</i>

38:38.856 --> 38:41.991
<i>surrounding ourselves with
girls who had also gone crazy.</i>

38:42.059 --> 38:44.160
(reporters clamoring, cameras clicking)

38:44.228 --> 38:47.663
â™ª Won't you come see about me â™ª

38:47.731 --> 38:50.133
â™ª I'll be alone â™ª

38:50.200 --> 38:53.169
â™ª Dancing, you know it, baby â™ª

38:53.237 --> 38:56.339
â™ª Tell me your troubles and doubts â™ª

38:56.407 --> 38:58.941
â™ª Giving me everything â™ª

38:59.009 --> 39:01.544
â™ª Inside and out and... â™ª

39:01.612 --> 39:03.546
CHANEL: <i>And now here we were,</i>

39:03.614 --> 39:05.148
<i>about to spend the rest of our lives</i>

39:05.215 --> 39:07.450
<i>trapped with a bunch of
mentally unstable women</i>

39:07.518 --> 39:09.452
<i>totally divorced from
any sense of reality</i>

39:09.520 --> 39:11.154
<i>and therefore capable of anything.</i>

39:11.221 --> 39:13.890
<i>From the second we set
foot in that asylum,</i>

39:13.957 --> 39:16.492
<i>I knew we were gonna
feel right at home.</i>

39:16.560 --> 39:19.695
<i>Asylum life suited us just fine.</i>

39:19.763 --> 39:21.497
<i>Number Three went full lez</i>

39:21.565 --> 39:23.800
<i>and fell in love with one
of the lesbian nurses.</i>

39:23.867 --> 39:26.769
<i>I mean, in women's prison,
everyone's sort of lesbian,</i>

39:26.837 --> 39:29.172
<i>but Number Three was
really going for it.</i>

39:29.239 --> 39:31.374
I think I'm ready to show you my ears.

39:33.110 --> 39:35.545
CHANEL: <i>The psychiatrist put
Number Five on these meds</i>

39:35.612 --> 39:37.847
<i>that made her actually tolerable.</i>

39:37.915 --> 39:40.550
<i>Believe me, no one was
more shocked than I was</i>

39:40.617 --> 39:43.419
<i>when she became my best friend
in the whole wide world.</i>

39:43.487 --> 39:46.422
<i>I told her all my
deepest, darkest secrets.</i>

39:46.490 --> 39:48.191
Do you want to know my biggest secret?

39:48.258 --> 39:50.560
I love it here! I never want to leave!

39:50.627 --> 39:52.128
I know! Me, too!

39:52.196 --> 39:54.597
(laughs)

39:54.665 --> 39:57.066
CHANEL: <i>I felt totally transformed,</i>

39:57.134 --> 39:59.469
<i>like this enormous weight had
been lifted off my shoulders.</i>

39:59.536 --> 40:02.171
<i>Inside this asylum, there
was no more judgment,</i>

40:02.239 --> 40:04.073
<i>no more popularity contests,</i>

40:04.141 --> 40:06.476
<i>no social media pressure to be
the hottest or the meanest.</i>

40:06.543 --> 40:08.311
<i>And best of all,</i>

40:08.378 --> 40:10.480
<i>there were no boys to stay skinny for.</i>

40:12.349 --> 40:13.282
â™ª Hey, hey, hey, hey... â™ª

40:13.350 --> 40:15.751
(giggling)

40:15.819 --> 40:19.856
â™ª Ooh... â™ª

40:24.561 --> 40:25.495
That's it.

40:25.562 --> 40:26.662
The votes are in.

40:26.730 --> 40:28.531
It's unanimous.

40:28.599 --> 40:30.533
Congratulations, Chanel.

40:30.601 --> 40:32.869
You've been voted house president.

40:34.972 --> 40:37.340
Thank you so much.

40:38.098 --> 40:42.812
Now, let's all raise a Dixie
cup of delicious prune wine

40:42.880 --> 40:45.581
that Number Five so lovingly
brewed for us in the toilet.

40:47.651 --> 40:50.486
To... Chanel.

40:50.554 --> 40:52.488
ALL: To Chanel.

40:52.556 --> 40:53.856
â™ª When you walk away â™ª

40:53.924 --> 40:55.858
(footsteps echoing)

40:59.696 --> 41:01.697
â™ª

41:09.773 --> 41:12.175
(sighs)

41:39.469 --> 41:40.937
(leather creaks, metallic swish)

41:49.580 --> 41:51.414
(sighs)

41:55.419 --> 41:57.753
(screaming)
