10:56.250 --> 10:58.821
WHY DONT YOU LET ME WORRY

10:58.830 --> 11:00.787
YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT

11:00.790 --> 11:04.693
JORDAN, WHY DONT YOU GIVE ME

11:10.790 --> 11:13.942
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT

LOOK, YOU ARE BURNING IT
AT BOTH ENDS OFF THE FIELD.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.070
I CANT HAVE YOU DOING

11:43.080 --> 11:46.038
LOOK, MAN, I LEFT BEHIND MY
FAMILY, AIGHT, MY FRIENDS, MY SCHOOL.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.498

I UNDERSTAND THAT.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.820
IM TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

11:49.830 --> 11:51.787
I DIDNT COME HERE

11:51.790 --> 11:54.999
I CAME HERE TO WIN,
AND THE WAY I SEE IT,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.618
I AINT THE ONLY ONE WITH IT

12:00.750 --> 12:05.290

13:40.000 --> 13:41.115

13:41.120 --> 13:44.533
MAKING PEOPLE

13:45.830 --> 13:47.696

13:47.700 --> 13:51.944

13:57.370 --> 13:59.691
SO, WHAT IS THIS
BOOSTER PARTY, ANYWAY?

13:59.700 --> 14:01.282
JUST A BUNCH

14:01.290 --> 14:02.826
KNOCKING BACK

14:02.830 --> 14:04.400
AND CONGRATULATING
THEMSELVES ABOUT

14:04.410 --> 14:06.617
A FOOTBALL TEAM THEY HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH.

14:06.620 --> 14:08.531
BUT THEY FUND
THE SPORTS PROGRAM,

14:08.540 --> 14:10.656
SO MY DAD SUCKS IT UP,

14:15.200 --> 14:16.406
I DIDNT REALIZE
IT WAS THAT BAD.

14:16.410 --> 14:20.574
YEAH, I DONT REALLY REMEMBER
MUCH ABOUT MY DAD PLAYING BALL...

14:20.580 --> 14:24.995
BUT WHAT I DO REMEMBER
IS HOW HE WAS AFTER--

14:25.000 --> 14:27.537
DISTANT,
NO REAL PURPOSE,

14:27.540 --> 14:30.692
UNTIL MY MOM HEARD BEVERLY
NEEDED A NEW COACH,

14:30.700 --> 14:34.785
AND THEN THE LIGHT
CAME BACK IN HIS EYES.

14:36.330 --> 14:41.404
ID JUST HATE TO SEE HIM

16:39.510 --> 16:41.092

16:41.100 --> 16:43.341

I AM ALONE.

16:43.350 --> 16:46.593
MY DAD TRAVELS A LOT
FOR WORK--NEW YORK, PARIS.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.342
HEY, AT LEAST YOU KNOW
WHERE HE IS.

16:49.350 --> 16:52.251
MY DAD LEFT

16:52.260 --> 16:54.467
I AINT SEEN HIM SINCE.

16:54.470 --> 16:56.211
WHY DID HE LEAVE?

16:56.220 --> 16:59.679

16:59.680 --> 17:02.138

NEW JOB SOMEWHERE,

17:02.140 --> 17:04.757

WELL, MY DADS ALWAYS

17:08.599 --> 17:13.503
PRODUCING CAREER, WIFE

17:13.510 --> 17:16.593
I THINK THEY JUST HAD
ONE KID CAUSE...

17:16.599 --> 17:20.548
THEY ONLY HAD SO MUCH
LOVE LEFT TO GIVE.

17:20.550 --> 17:23.849

17:23.849 --> 17:26.887
WE WERE ALL ON VACATION
ON ASPEN AND--

17:26.890 --> 17:29.541
AH, LIVING
THE BOUGIE LIFE.

17:29.550 --> 17:32.793
UM...

17:32.800 --> 17:34.131
MY MOM NEVER LIKED TO SKI.

17:34.140 --> 17:38.919
SHE WAS MORE OF A "SIT IN THE LOUNGE
ROOM AND DRINK HOT COCOA" TYPE.

17:38.930 --> 17:43.254
SHE SAID SHE NEEDED TO GO
HOME, ASKED ME TO COME WITH HER.

17:43.260 --> 17:47.925

TO THE AIRPORT.

17:47.930 --> 17:50.843
CAR ACCIDENT, SO...

17:54.510 --> 17:58.048
SHE WAS JUST GONE.

17:58.550 --> 18:01.429
HEY, LOOK,

18:01.430 --> 18:03.171
I DIDNT KNOW.

18:03.180 --> 18:04.500
ITS OK.

18:04.510 --> 18:06.638
IT IS WHAT IT IS,
RIGHT?

18:06.640 --> 18:10.383
I GUESS I JUST THOUGHT
YOU HAD IT MADE.

18:10.760 --> 18:16.381
YOU CAN COME FROM ANYWHERE
AND HAVE A SAD STORY, SPENCER.

18:16.390 --> 18:18.677

21:12.220 --> 21:13.756
WITH ALL THAT YOU HAVE,

21:13.760 --> 21:15.250
WHY WOULD YOU TRY

21:15.260 --> 21:19.049
<i>LAURA: HONEY, TM SURE THATS

CALLING HIM "SON,"

21:46.260 --> 21:49.002

21:49.010 --> 21:52.674
WELL, IF YOU FELT THAT WAY, YOU SHOULD

21:52.680 --> 21:57.425

THIS HOUSE WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ANY OF US.

21:57.430 --> 21:59.137

21:59.890 --> 22:01.289
THAT MAY BE THE CASE,

22:01.300 --> 22:03.632
<i>BUT TM STILL DISAPPOINTED

22:42.300 --> 22:47.136
WHY DO YOU THINK HE EVEN
PICKED UP A FOOTBALL?

22:49.350 --> 22:51.170

WHAT GOOD AM I
OTHERWISE?

34:16.659 --> 34:18.992
SPENCER...

34:19.000 --> 34:20.741
WIN OR LOSE,
YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE

34:20.750 --> 34:22.786
THAN WHAT YOU ARE
ON THAT FIELD.

34:22.790 --> 34:26.033
YOU PUSH YOURSELF
SO DAMN HARD

34:26.040 --> 34:28.190
TRYING TO TAKE CARE
OF US ALL.

34:28.199 --> 34:31.579
AND YOUVE BEEN LIKE THAT
EVER SINCE YOUR DADDY LEFT,

34:31.580 --> 34:36.449
TRYING TO PROVE SOMETHING
TO YOURSELF AND TO HIM.

34:36.449 --> 34:41.034
BUT YOU CANT HOLD UP THE
WORLD ON YOUR OWN, BABY.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.656
OK?

35:02.790 --> 35:04.531
IM HERE.

35:04.540 --> 35:07.862
WHATS SO IMPORTANT?

35:08.160 --> 35:12.700
LOOK, WE HAVENT TALKED
SINCE YOU GOT BACK FROM REHAB.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.783
I THOUGHT THAT--
THOUGHT WHAT?

35:15.790 --> 35:17.110
THAT WE SHOULD.

35:17.120 --> 35:20.613
LOOK, I--I KNOW THAT I HAVENT
BEEN THE BEST BOYFRIEND

35:20.620 --> 35:22.657
TO LEILA, BUT I WANT
TO CHANGE THAT.

35:22.660 --> 35:26.619
AND WITH SPENCER
AT BEVERLY NOW...

35:26.910 --> 35:28.400
I FEEL LIKE SHES
PULLING AWAY.

35:28.410 --> 35:31.152
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU
AND I ARE ON THE SAME PAGE--

35:31.160 --> 35:33.322
THERE IS NO
"YOU AND 1."

35:33.330 --> 35:36.368
IT WAS ONE
DRUG-INDUCED SCREW-UP.

35:36.370 --> 35:38.156
WE GOT CAUGHT UP
IN THE MOMENT,

35:38.160 --> 35:43.997
AND I HAD TO WALK AWAY FROM
MY BEST FRIEND BECAUSE OF IT.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.440
I LOST LEILA,
AND I HAVE TO LIVE

35:46.450 --> 35:48.077
WITH THAT GUILT FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.241
WE BOTH HAVE
TO LIVE WITH IT.

35:49.250 --> 35:50.820
THEN LETS
JUST KEEP PRETENDING

35:50.830 --> 35:52.901
THAT IT DIDNT
HAPPEN, OK?

35:52.910 --> 35:57.199
LEILA DESERVES
AT LEAST THAT FROM US.

36:13.620 --> 36:14.655
IS THIS
ANOTHER INTERVENTION?

36:14.660 --> 36:19.439
BECAUSE I CANT HANDLE ANOTHER
RAMBLING LETTER FROM JORDAN RIGHT NOW.

36:19.450 --> 36:20.531
LAURA: NO, HONEY.

36:20.540 --> 36:24.078
DAD JUST HAS SOMETHING
HE WANTS TO SAY.

36:24.330 --> 36:26.651
BILLY: HAVE A SEAT.
THANK YOU, BABY.

36:26.660 --> 36:30.403
UH...YOURE RIGHT.

36:30.410 --> 36:33.323
I BROUGHT SPENCER
TO BEVERLY HILLS

36:33.330 --> 36:37.039
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT
WAS RIGHT FOR ME,

36:37.040 --> 36:39.077
AND SPENCER, UM,

36:39.080 --> 36:41.822
BUT I DIDNT--I DIDNT
CONSIDER YOU GUYS.

36:41.830 --> 36:45.949
I DIDNT, AND FOR THAT,
I--I1 APOLOGIZE.

36:45.950 --> 36:47.998
I KNOW, WIN OR LOSE,

36:48.000 --> 36:49.786
JOB OR NO JOB,

36:49.790 --> 36:54.000
UH, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
TO ME IS NOT FOOTBALL.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.288
ITS YOU GUYS.

36:57.290 --> 36:58.030
<i>YEAH, TM SORRY.</i>

36:58.040 --> 37:01.658
I JUST WISH I WOULD HAVE TOLD
YOU THAT A LITTLE BIT SOONER.

37:01.660 --> 37:05.290
ITS UP TO YOU GUYS WHETHER
OR NOT SPENCER STAYS

37:05.290 --> 37:08.442
BECAUSE, UH,
IF YOU GUYS ARENT COOL,

37:08.450 --> 37:10.282
IF WERE NOT COOL
AS A FAMLLY,

37:10.290 --> 37:14.443
THEN ITS NOT THE RIGHT THING
TO DO FOR ANYONE,

37:14.450 --> 37:16.441
EVEN SPENCER.

37:16.450 --> 37:18.748
SO IF WE SAY NO,

37:18.750 --> 37:21.572
HES GONE, JUST LIKE THAT?

37:23.080 --> 37:25.902
JUST LIKE THAT.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.901
SINGER: HELP ME

37:30.910 --> 37:34.790
ITS LIKE THE WALLS
ARE CAVING IN

37:34.790 --> 37:41.116
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
GIVING UP, BUT I JUST CANT

37:41.120 --> 37:43.248
IT ISNT IN MY BLOOD

37:43.250 --> 37:46.072
LAYING ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR,
FEELING NOTHING

37:46.080 --> 37:50.369
IM OVERWHELMED AND INSECURE,
GIVE ME SOMETHING

37:50.370 --> 37:51.826
THANKS FOR COMING.

37:51.830 --> 37:53.901
YEAH, IM NOT SURE
HOW SMART THIS IS,

37:53.910 --> 37:57.540
AFTER THAT LAST
APPEARANCE YOU MADE.

38:04.250 --> 38:06.947
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
WHEN WE MET.

38:06.950 --> 38:09.112
FIRST DAY
AT LITTLE LEAGUE.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.327
MAN, I DIDNT EVEN
KNOW YOU WAS A GIRL.

38:11.330 --> 38:14.698
THATS CAUSE I STRIKED YOUR
ASS OUT 3 TIMES. TWICE, MAN.

38:14.700 --> 38:15.997
YOU DID THAT TWICE,
ALL RBIGHT?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.037
WHEN THEY FIGURED IT OUT,
THEY TRIED TO MAKE ME PLAY

38:18.040 --> 38:19.496
FOR THE GIRLS LEAGUE.
RIGHT.

38:19.500 --> 38:23.152
BUT YOU WAS LIKE, "NO!
IF SHE GO, I GO!"

38:23.160 --> 38:24.992
BUT THEY NEEDED YOU.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.367
YOU WAS A BALLER AT 6,

38:27.370 --> 38:30.192
SO I GOT TO STAY.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.492
IM WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, COOP.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.366
YOU DONT NEED TO BE.

38:37.370 --> 38:40.579
YOU NEED TO STOP WORRYING
ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE.

38:40.580 --> 38:43.868
I GOT IT HANDLED,
FOR REAL THIS TIME,

38:43.870 --> 38:46.862
BUT YOU GOT TO TRUST ME.

38:53.370 --> 38:54.690
WHAT?

38:54.700 --> 38:55.656

AT ME FOR?

38:55.660 --> 38:57.788

ALL DEEP WITH ME.

38:57.790 --> 38:58.860
SHUT UP.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.998
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
GIVING UP

39:01.000 --> 39:07.531
BUT I JUST CANT,
IT ISNT IN MY BLOOD

39:10.410 --> 39:13.903
IT ISNT IN MY BLOOD

39:15.500 --> 39:18.242
HA HA HA HA!

39:18.250 --> 39:19.536
OK, ARE YOU READY?

39:19.540 --> 39:21.827

39:21.830 --> 39:22.945
OH, HES HOME.

39:22.950 --> 39:26.500
BILLY: HEY, MAN. HOPE YOURE
HUNGRY, YOUNG SPENCER.

39:26.500 --> 39:27.945

HIS FAMOUS RIBS.

39:27.950 --> 39:31.329
HE JUST MIXES TWO SAUCES TOGETHER,
BUT ITS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.

39:31.330 --> 39:33.867

39:33.870 --> 39:35.577
THANK YOU, BABY.

39:43.620 --> 39:45.247

I MEANT.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.571
BILLY: I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEANT.

39:47.580 --> 39:49.821
THE FAMILY DISCUSSED IT

39:49.830 --> 39:51.320
AND DECIDED.

39:51.330 --> 39:54.789
THERES PLENTY
FOR EVERYBODY.

39:55.580 --> 39:58.117
JORDAN: SPENCE, UH,

39:58.120 --> 40:00.532

40:00.540 --> 40:03.908
I WAS ANGRY AT MY DAD
AND I TOOK IT OUT ON YOU

40:03.910 --> 40:06.117
AND...ITS NOT COOL.

40:06.120 --> 40:08.498
BUT I DIDNT MEAN TO TAKE YOU
AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY.

40:08.500 --> 40:13.119
I GUESS THERE ARE WORSE PLACES
TO END UP THAN BEVERLY HILLS, RIGHT?

40:13.120 --> 40:14.861
HEH! RIGHT.
