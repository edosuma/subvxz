[man coughing]

02:47.384 --> 02:49.517
My dear, sweet Elizia.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.259
I've loved you these
many, many years.

02:53.695 --> 02:57.742
But I found something new,
something greater than love.

02:59.962 --> 03:00.789
Who is she?

03:00.832 --> 03:03.313
There is no she, just an--

03:04.706 --> 03:07.883
it, an-- it, a thing, a

03:09.885 --> 03:10.755
deepness

03:12.888 --> 03:17.588
that can only invade a soul
and initiate a longing
that fills the entire earth,

03:17.632 --> 03:19.721
up on earth to treasure
deeper than gold,

03:19.764 --> 03:24.465
purpose farther than
the Sun, a beautiful
masterpiece inside of me.

03:25.770 --> 03:30.601
The local wizards have
opened my inner cornea

03:31.689 --> 03:34.562
and unveiled my inner ear drum.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.610
Local wizards?

03:39.654 --> 03:43.875
Yeah, Alistair Newman say that I
have radioed into the new world,

03:43.919 --> 03:45.312
the prime universe

03:47.488 --> 03:51.231
and they've protected me
from the Lizard people.

03:52.710 --> 03:54.146
Lizard people?

03:55.583 --> 03:58.673
The Lizards, the Gray's,

04:00.936 --> 04:01.763
the Whites.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.779
Newman even gave me this.

04:18.822 --> 04:23.263
It protects me from
the abductions and it
makes me a receiver.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.655
To receive what?

04:26.570 --> 04:29.704
Messages from beyond.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.101
Does this mean we're broken up?

Elizia, are you there?

06:17.289 --> 06:18.290
-[Elizia] Coming.
-Hello!

06:18.334 --> 06:19.335
Coming.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.732
Elizia, what is going
on in there?

06:24.775 --> 06:26.211
Nothing, nothing at all.

06:26.255 --> 06:29.214
Sounds like somebody's
being murdered in there.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.302
Are you okay?

06:30.346 --> 06:32.435
Yeah I'm fine,
everything's fine.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.394
Is there somebody
in here with you?

06:34.437 --> 06:35.830
No, just me.

06:37.919 --> 06:41.705
Are you being held hostage?
Blink twice if there's somebody
in here with you.

06:41.749 --> 06:45.840
No I'm fine,
everything's fine. Thank you.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.799
Well all right then. You know,
if you need anything...

06:48.843 --> 06:50.975
Yep. Got it. Thank you.

[phone still ringing]

07:40.721 --> 07:43.027
Hello?

07:43.071 --> 07:44.420
[telemarketer] Would you like
to win a free chance to take
a trip of a lifetime?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.206
No. No. Thank you.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.339
[telemarketer] Ma'am,
are you all right?

07:51.514 --> 07:53.081
No.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.996
No, I'm not.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.998
[telemarketer] Would
you like to talk about it?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.002
I don't know. I don't know you.

08:01.045 --> 08:04.919
[telemarketer] Sometimes all you need is a listening ear. That's part of a telemarketer's job.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.444
I don't even know
where to begin.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.099
[telemarketer] Start
from the beginning, girl.

08:12.840 --> 08:13.536
Well,

08:15.582 --> 08:17.714
I met Fred about
three years ago.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.891
He was a swell guy.

08:20.935 --> 08:24.504
He was the perfect guy.

08:26.070 --> 08:30.118
He would wrap me up at night
and swaddle me like a child.

08:30.161 --> 08:34.251
We would go get ice cream
and he would always wipe
the drips from my chin.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.953
-We'd go to the movies
and laugh at the same parts.
-[melancholic music playing]

08:42.086 --> 08:43.260
And then...

08:43.304 --> 08:44.261
[telemarketer]
Then what happened?

08:45.742 --> 08:47.352
Then he became distant.

08:47.396 --> 08:48.353
[telemarketer] Distant, how?

08:50.486 --> 08:54.272
He would go get eggs and be
gone for hours. And he would--

08:54.316 --> 08:58.407
started wearing gloves,
buying lots of aluminum foil,

08:58.450 --> 09:01.279
eating kale, you know.
It wasn't right.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.498
[telemarketer] Then what?

09:02.542 --> 09:03.760
Then it was over.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.763
Just like that.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.201
He said he'd found
enlightenment,

09:11.463 --> 09:15.729
a truer path, a gateway
to the inner ear.

09:15.772 --> 09:19.254
[telemarketer] And why couldn't you go down this path with him?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.604
He wouldn't let me.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.607
He said he had to do it alone.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.567
[telemarketer] The true
path is the singular path.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.354
What?

09:32.397 --> 09:34.835
[telemarketer] Sometimes
the only way to be
at peace is to be alone.

09:34.878 --> 09:40.492
Look at it this way. Fred
is giving you a gift, a chance
to find peace within yourself,

09:40.536 --> 09:42.799
to find your own path.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.714
Yeah, maybe.

09:45.715 --> 09:48.457
I don't know,
it still hurts a lot.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.719
Almost too much.

09:54.028 --> 09:58.032
I must sound like an idiot,
blubbering on and on like this.

09:58.075 --> 10:03.037
[telemarketer] Oh it's nothing, believe me. You hear all sorts of things in this line of work.

10:04.473 --> 10:08.390
Well, if it's all the same to
you, thanks for listening to me.

10:08.433 --> 10:11.088
Anytime. You have
a good night ma'am.

10:11.132 --> 10:11.915
You too.

10:13.308 --> 10:16.746
I'm Elizia, by the way.
I didn't catch your name.

10:16.790 --> 10:20.141
[telemarketer] You can just
call me The Telemarketer.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.318
Well,

10:24.667 --> 10:27.061
good night, The Telemarketer.

10:27.104 --> 10:29.106
[telemarketer]
Good night, Elizia.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.162
[phone calling]

10:46.646 --> 10:48.778
[voicemail] Hi,
you've reached Elizia.

10:48.822 --> 10:52.521
I'm either not here or I don't care about answering the phone.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.697
Either way, save words
after the beep-a-de-beep.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.307
[long beep]

10:56.351 --> 11:00.355
Elizia, it's Dan. You missed
two days of work in a row.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.053
You haven't called. Did no one
get in touch with you?

11:03.097 --> 11:05.839
Look, if you're not
at work on time tomorrow,

11:05.882 --> 11:10.844
then I'm gonna have to let
you go. I'm sorry but
I got a business to run.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.585
Uh, hopefully, you
get this message.

11:13.629 --> 11:14.761
[long beep]

11:21.115 --> 11:24.379
This one smells like bananas,
you know, kind of like,

11:24.422 --> 11:30.254
it's been sitting out in the
sun too long radiating
by our mother-ship.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.952
[sniffing]

11:31.995 --> 11:35.825
And this one,
this one smells musky,

11:35.869 --> 11:40.264
kind of rotten, kind
of like meat that's been
sitting out too long.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.573
I don't know. I think my old
Frankie will love them both.

11:44.616 --> 11:47.228
I just want this Valentine's
Day to be amazing.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.273
What do you think?

11:50.971 --> 11:52.624
They both smell lovely.

11:54.322 --> 11:57.151
But you didn't even
smell my wrist.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.805
I don't have to.

11:58.848 --> 12:01.851
Your beauty is worth more than
a fragrance on an appendage

12:01.895 --> 12:05.812
and your love shouldn't be tied
to extrasensory enhancements.

12:05.855 --> 12:08.771
If Frankie can't love you
without a certain smell
attachment,

12:08.815 --> 12:11.774
then you should seek
a new relationship.

12:11.818 --> 12:17.084
Umm, okay. I guess
I'll take the one
that smells like bananas.

12:33.970 --> 12:37.931
Have a nice day and thank
you for shopping at
Fashion Style Mart Hut.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.716
[door bells ringing]

12:46.766 --> 12:49.203
[soft store music playing]

13:04.174 --> 13:05.262
Hey Elizia.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.829
-[glass breaking]
-Oh shit!

13:06.873 --> 13:09.440
Um, I'm so sorry. I didn't--

13:10.441 --> 13:12.922
Uh, I didn't mean
to scare you like that.

13:14.663 --> 13:20.190
Listen, um I was just
wondering if--

13:20.234 --> 13:22.149
Look I know that Fred uh-

13:24.107 --> 13:27.850
Listen, what I'm trying to say
is I know that Valentine's Day
is coming up

13:27.894 --> 13:29.852
and I would hate for you
to be alone and all...

13:29.896 --> 13:31.027
It's fine.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.117
Okay then.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.641
Well in that case, uh,

13:39.035 --> 13:40.994
if you care to join me for...

13:41.037 --> 13:42.560
I'm fine.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.824
Thank you for
asking, but I'm fine.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.695
Okay then.

13:46.738 --> 13:47.609
Uh--

13:51.482 --> 13:52.222
I

13:53.963 --> 13:56.792
yeah-- I was just-- in case
you change your mind,

13:58.402 --> 14:01.405
you know where to find
me. I guess.

14:01.449 --> 14:02.319
I guess.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.845
Okay then, um...

14:08.412 --> 14:10.501
It was good talking to you.
[giggling]

14:42.838 --> 14:46.973
Elizia, you've got to get a hold
of yourself.

14:47.016 --> 14:49.279
You've got to move on.

14:49.323 --> 14:54.763
We all saw the writing on the
wall. He was going nuts talking
about aliens all the time,

14:54.806 --> 14:59.507
dolphins, one plus one
is three, reading all kinds
of pamphlets.

14:59.550 --> 15:03.815
Yeah, you know, he gave me
that one book 101 Ways
to Connect with the Dead.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.643
How to connect
with your inner lizard?

15:05.687 --> 15:07.907
Weird shit man, yeah,
you don't need that.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.865
Yeah, none of us needs that.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.434
Okay that's enough, guys.
Let's hear from Ellie.

15:13.477 --> 15:14.565
Ellie, baby,

15:15.915 --> 15:16.916
how are you doing?

15:17.786 --> 15:18.656
What do you think?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.182
How am I doing?

15:24.053 --> 15:25.098
What do I think?

15:31.539 --> 15:33.106
You remember that magic trick,

15:35.064 --> 15:39.721
that great trick
when we were kids?

15:41.375 --> 15:44.552
[Elizia] The top-hatted
magician would set a table

15:45.596 --> 15:51.037
with wine, deserts,
a roast duck in the middle,
all shiny and fat.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.039
Then

15:55.128 --> 15:57.130
he would make his way

15:57.173 --> 15:59.132
to the end of the long table,

16:00.176 --> 16:01.873
grab the hem of that

16:03.397 --> 16:05.877
beautiful red tablecloth and tug

16:06.835 --> 16:09.751
so quickly and in
such a way that

16:10.621 --> 16:13.929
all that delicious food and
drink would stay in place,

16:15.235 --> 16:17.367
but the cloth
underneath had vanished.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.330
That's what happens when

16:25.593 --> 16:32.252
a professional, someone suited
for the job, performs that bit
of prestidigitation but...

16:34.602 --> 16:36.256
[exhaling]

16:36.299 --> 16:37.822
...when an amateur does it--

16:40.260 --> 16:41.348
when Fred does it,

16:43.393 --> 16:45.091
the roast duck is on the ground,

16:46.048 --> 16:48.268
cake is smashed to bits

16:49.182 --> 16:51.358
and the wine bottle
is shattered.

17:00.497 --> 17:01.716
He shattered me.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.909
-So, me and the girls
have been talking.
-Yeah.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.001
Yeah, we've been talking and
we think that maybe it's time
you get back out there again,

17:26.045 --> 17:28.569
you know,
play the field a little.

17:28.612 --> 17:32.616
Valentine's Day is just around
the corner and it's a good
time to go fishing.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.750
Go fishing?

17:35.793 --> 17:39.058
[Beth] Why don't you just
grab a newspaper, look
through the classifieds,

17:39.101 --> 17:43.062
see if there's someone
that you can tolerate.
Could be interesting, right?

17:45.542 --> 17:47.979
I like books. I like numbers.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.285
Numbers?

17:49.329 --> 17:51.679
Yes, numbers are fascinating,

17:51.722 --> 17:54.769
prime, negative, odds,
even, square-roots.

17:54.812 --> 17:59.208
Heck, without numbers
we wouldn't have computers,
cell phones, transistors, chips.

17:59.252 --> 18:02.646
It's all about technology,
nano computers.

18:02.690 --> 18:04.735
Did you know that there
are nanorobotics bees

18:04.779 --> 18:07.564
that can pollinate the earth
just as well as real bees?

18:07.608 --> 18:09.131
Robotic bees?

18:09.175 --> 18:11.525
That's right, we're talking
global proportions.

18:11.568 --> 18:15.094
Numbers turn into science
and science turns everything
into automation.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.617
Robots.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.706
Some day we will serve them.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.011
Serve who?

18:20.055 --> 18:21.665
The robots!

18:21.709 --> 18:24.146
And I'll be damned if I'm not
first in line to be subservient

18:24.190 --> 18:27.410
to my higher intelligent
Android robotic overlords.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.804
[spacey music playing]

18:34.678 --> 18:37.507
Jazz, true jazz.

18:37.551 --> 18:41.163
You see, jazz is like life,

18:41.207 --> 18:45.167
unpredictable,
out of the blue, sporadic.

18:45.211 --> 18:50.172
Then how do you deal
with life, that is?

18:50.216 --> 18:54.524
You deal by dealing
with what you're dealt.

18:55.395 --> 18:56.526
Let me lay this down.

18:58.093 --> 19:03.229
Say you're dealt the Sun,
you dance in it.

19:03.272 --> 19:06.667
Say you're dealt
with the fool, you chastise it.

19:06.710 --> 19:10.932
You're dealt the king
of swords, you fight it.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.281
Say you're dealt death...

19:15.023 --> 19:17.156
What, what do you do?

19:18.635 --> 19:24.511
Well, you either re-deal
or you embrace it.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.775
Either way, it's coming
for us all in the end.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.691
Speaking of death,

19:32.301 --> 19:33.781
have you ever seen a man die?

19:36.131 --> 19:40.483
You know, in the movies when
you strangle someone, it only
takes some seconds to kill them.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.137
Seconds!

19:42.181 --> 19:46.185
Well it's not that simple.
You see, you gotta
squeeze real hard,

19:46.228 --> 19:48.099
so hard it hurts the hands,

19:48.143 --> 19:50.885
the eyes roll up
and the throat gargles.

19:50.928 --> 19:53.366
It's hard, it's real horror.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.020
It changes a man.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.377
[sipping]

20:25.528 --> 20:27.661
[dramatic music playing]

20:31.665 --> 20:34.189
[phone ringing]

20:55.776 --> 20:57.952
-Hello?
-[telemarketer] Hey, girl!

20:59.083 --> 21:00.650
Who is it?

21:00.694 --> 21:03.479
[telemarketer] It's me. You
know, from the other day.

21:03.523 --> 21:04.915
The Telemarketer?

21:04.959 --> 21:06.439
My friends call me Telly.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.616
I'm-- what--

21:11.052 --> 21:13.533
What do you want?

21:13.576 --> 21:16.710
[telemarketer] Oh nothing-- to see how you're feeling. You were pretty broken up the other day.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.540
-Uh...
-[telemarketer] I'm concerned
about you, Ellie.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.193
Please don't call me that.

21:22.237 --> 21:24.108
[telemarketer] But that's
short for Elizia, isn't it?

21:24.152 --> 21:26.415
That's what your friends
would call you, wouldn't they?

21:26.459 --> 21:29.200
Aren't we friends? I feel
like we're friends now.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.073
[Elizia] Please,
please stop calling me.

21:32.116 --> 21:35.032
Don't, don't call me anymore.
I don't know you.

21:36.686 --> 21:38.297
[telemarketer] But you've
always known me.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.175
[water sprinkling]

22:09.415 --> 22:11.808
[distant barking]

22:34.396 --> 22:40.359
[man on TV] What's up with
the farmer John who is milking
the cows, you know?

22:40.402 --> 22:43.013
[man 2] Hey I mean,
praying is for church, huh?

22:43.057 --> 22:44.841
[woman] I haven't seen you
in church lately.

22:44.885 --> 22:49.368
[man 2] Well, there's not much
sense in my going to church.

22:50.717 --> 22:51.805
[man 3] Are you hurt?

22:52.719 --> 22:55.112
Is the world letting you down?

22:56.549 --> 23:00.074
Is the trials and tribulations
that you are feeling

23:01.467 --> 23:03.947
making a black void
in your soul?

23:04.861 --> 23:11.477
I'm here to help you. There is somebody that can help which is the Lord. Do you feel let down?

23:12.913 --> 23:14.654
Are you terminally ill?

23:16.307 --> 23:19.398
Do you feel all is not right
in your life?

23:20.311 --> 23:22.096
Maybe you're in a breakup.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.142
Has that person left you?

23:26.317 --> 23:27.449
Do you need help?

23:28.711 --> 23:31.279
Well I have the good
news for you.

23:32.236 --> 23:34.151
Please lay your hands

23:34.195 --> 23:38.025
on the screen and touch mine
through the power
of the television.

23:39.069 --> 23:40.767
Do you feel the healing?

23:41.855 --> 23:44.248
Please touch my hands

23:44.292 --> 23:48.905
and listen
to the Word of the Lord.

23:50.777 --> 23:53.127
[chanting]

23:53.170 --> 23:55.390
[Elizia whispering]

24:01.309 --> 24:03.746
[man] Pray.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.313
Pray!

24:06.401 --> 24:07.968
Pray!

24:10.884 --> 24:11.928
[man in deep voice] Elizia.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.585
Come forward, Elizia.

24:18.544 --> 24:21.285
Go forward, one foot
in front of another

24:22.896 --> 24:27.161
until nothing is left
but the light.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.558
[double bass playing]

24:35.778 --> 24:37.998
[Elizia] Have you ever
heard God speak?

24:38.041 --> 24:39.129
Like a real voice?

24:39.173 --> 24:41.131
Like a man's voice?

24:41.175 --> 24:47.877
Yes, an audible voice,
a powerful assertion
or insertion into your brain,

24:47.921 --> 24:51.011
into your inner ear.

24:51.054 --> 24:53.492
I don't believe that is a man.

24:53.535 --> 24:54.580
Then what is he?

24:54.623 --> 24:59.019
If it exists, it's um,
cosmic force.

24:59.062 --> 25:01.108
I don't know Mary, you sound
like Obi-Wan Kenobi.

25:01.151 --> 25:04.546
Guys, I heard God this morning.

25:05.721 --> 25:11.640
He, she, it whatever,
God spoke to me, like,
audibly spoke to me.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.468
[Mary] Oh come on!

25:13.512 --> 25:17.472
Ellie, what did God say?

25:18.429 --> 25:20.257
The voice said,

25:21.868 --> 25:23.217
"Keep moving forward.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.133
One foot in front of the other

25:27.047 --> 25:29.266
until nothing is left
but light."

25:30.485 --> 25:34.054
So what drugs are you taking?
Because I want some.

25:34.097 --> 25:37.057
Seriously though, Ellie,
you're starting to scare us.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.885
What do you mean?

25:38.928 --> 25:41.670
You haven't been going out
lately. You've been
keeping to yourself.

25:41.714 --> 25:43.846
You're totally wasted over Fred.

25:43.890 --> 25:45.500
[Beth] You're crying
all the time.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.023
[Mary] And now what,
you're receiving messages?

25:47.067 --> 25:49.025
[Elizia] I'm receiving messages

25:50.549 --> 25:52.202
from the beyond.

25:52.246 --> 25:54.509
You know, something
has got to change.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.251
How, Beth? How?

25:57.294 --> 26:00.167
Because I don't see
any changes in my future.

26:01.037 --> 26:04.519
[Mary] Change with time
is inevitable.

26:05.651 --> 26:08.523
That is a guarantee.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.743
[double bass continues playing]

26:22.842 --> 26:25.671
Do you have any other scents?

26:25.714 --> 26:26.976
Scents?

26:27.020 --> 26:31.024
Yes, other scents
besides bananas and musk.

26:33.156 --> 26:38.901
We have a variety of scents
here at Fashion Style Mart Hut.

26:40.642 --> 26:47.344
Something more with celery
or parsnip or ginger. Do you
have something like that?

26:47.388 --> 26:53.524
You may want to try
the beauty barn located
at 5th and Elm Street.

26:58.442 --> 27:01.620
Thank you for shopping
at Fashion Style Mart Hut.

27:04.666 --> 27:05.536
Hey Ellie!

27:11.020 --> 27:12.892
Uh, listen um--

27:14.720 --> 27:16.330
lunch break is coming up

27:17.505 --> 27:19.725
and I

27:19.768 --> 27:22.466
know this great spot that's
right around the corner it's...

27:22.510 --> 27:23.816
I'm not hungry.

27:24.730 --> 27:27.689
-Well, everybody's gotta eat.
-I'm fasting.

27:27.733 --> 27:28.603
For what?

27:29.691 --> 27:31.432
Wait, like--

27:31.475 --> 27:32.955
like, uh...

27:32.999 --> 27:34.478
Is it a religious thing?

27:35.610 --> 27:36.742
Because if so that's cool.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.265
Maybe, I don't know.

27:40.528 --> 27:41.398
Okay.

27:43.836 --> 27:44.924
Uh, well,

27:47.100 --> 27:49.363
some other time then?

27:50.538 --> 27:52.148
Maybe

27:52.192 --> 27:53.889
some other time.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.675
[distant barking]

28:01.767 --> 28:03.638
[Fred] --my inner ear drum.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.596
[phone ringing]

28:05.640 --> 28:07.511
Bananas and musk?

28:07.555 --> 28:08.861
Do you need help?

28:11.515 --> 28:12.734
Shut up!

28:12.778 --> 28:14.605
Shut up! Shut up!

28:14.649 --> 28:19.001
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut
up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

28:21.177 --> 28:23.266
[blabbering]

28:44.026 --> 28:46.072
[growling]

28:46.115 --> 28:47.029
Who's there?

28:51.599 --> 28:53.035
[distorted voices] Join us.

28:53.079 --> 28:54.341
Shit! Shit!

28:57.039 --> 28:58.258
Join us!

28:58.301 --> 29:03.350
No. Please. Please,
just leave me alone.

29:03.393 --> 29:06.919
Go away! Go away!
Go away!

29:08.007 --> 29:10.531
[phone ringing]

29:12.446 --> 29:14.578
-Hello?
-[telemarketer] Hello, friend.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.189
I haven't heard
from you in a bit.

29:16.232 --> 29:18.234
Why are you still calling me?

29:18.278 --> 29:21.629
[telemarketer] Because, Elizia,
we are one and the same.
We are destined.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.239
Destined for what?

29:23.283 --> 29:26.199
[telemarketer] To be
together forever.[giggling]

29:26.242 --> 29:29.593
You can never leave,
you can never leave us.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.730
-[phone ringing]
-[screaming]

29:47.350 --> 29:48.787
[knocking on the door]

29:50.179 --> 29:51.615
Who is it?

29:51.659 --> 29:54.227
Your neighbor, Lilith.

30:04.672 --> 30:08.894
I-- um, is there anything
I can help you with?

30:08.937 --> 30:14.377
Well, actually I made
far too many brownies
for my church's bake sale

30:14.421 --> 30:16.423
and I thought you
might want some.

30:16.466 --> 30:20.296
Oh no, Snickers, these
are not for you. [giggling]

30:20.340 --> 30:24.257
ah. Chocolate
will kill you. Yeah.

30:24.300 --> 30:27.347
Uh, thank you, I really
appreciate it.

30:27.390 --> 30:30.480
Um, I'll bring the plate back
when I'm done with it.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.743
Yeah, that reminds me.

30:32.787 --> 30:37.052
I've been hearing a lot
of strange noises lately.

30:37.096 --> 30:41.535
[exhaling] I'm concerned
about the safety of my
neighbors, you know.

30:41.578 --> 30:44.538
You know,
love thy neighbor and all.

30:44.581 --> 30:50.761
What sort of voices--
um noises, have you been
hearing exactly?

30:50.805 --> 30:52.198
Well, you know,

30:52.241 --> 30:54.853
the occasional plate breaking,

30:54.896 --> 30:56.942
heavy sobbing,

30:56.985 --> 30:58.682
banging on the walls,

31:02.686 --> 31:04.340
the kind of stuff that,
you know,

31:04.384 --> 31:06.690
you call the police for.

31:07.996 --> 31:09.998
Yeah, before you know it,

31:10.042 --> 31:13.523
there's three dead bodies
stuffed on a steamer trunk

31:13.567 --> 31:14.481
and then

31:16.265 --> 31:20.095
all the neighbors
are being interviewed
on unsolved mysteries.

31:21.357 --> 31:26.319
There is really no reason
to look behind every door
and underneath every table.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.103
I promise you there is nothing

31:29.757 --> 31:32.586
weird going on in my apartment.

31:33.761 --> 31:34.762
Well,

31:35.937 --> 31:38.244
you can never be too safe.

31:38.287 --> 31:43.553
Yes. Well, I appreciate
you being so concerned
about my safety and well-being.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.338
I really appreciate it.

31:45.381 --> 31:48.036
-Well that is why I'm here.
Now if you need anything...
-Mm-hmm.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.690
-Yes, absolutely.
-Anything at all...

31:49.733 --> 31:53.650
I know where you live. We are
next-door neighbors. Thank you.

31:55.739 --> 31:56.915
[exhaling]

32:01.920 --> 32:02.921
Damn it.

32:06.402 --> 32:10.624
Sorry, here's Snickers.
Again, thank you so much
for the brownies.

32:12.756 --> 32:14.062
[exhaling]

32:15.716 --> 32:17.500
[sound of the sea rolling]

32:24.768 --> 32:26.335
[Elizia] Ah...

32:37.694 --> 32:40.045
Well, Miss Cummings,
everything looks good there.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.611
It's Elizia.

32:41.655 --> 32:45.006
Yes. Well, Miss Cummings,
let's see what else we've done.

32:45.050 --> 32:48.618
Blood pressure looks fine.
No irregular heartbeat.

32:48.662 --> 32:52.840
Eyes, ears, nose and throat
all look wonderful. You're
in great physical condition.

32:52.883 --> 32:56.365
Then how do you explain
the voices, the hallucinations,

32:56.409 --> 32:59.281
the blood in my ear?

32:59.325 --> 33:02.545
Well, I mean, I can schedule
to run some CAT scans,

33:02.589 --> 33:08.377
brain scans and a whole host
of other tests and pokes
and prods but

33:08.421 --> 33:10.466
now I've seen
similar cases to this

33:10.510 --> 33:15.036
and my gut's telling me
they'll all come back
as clean as a whistle.

33:16.298 --> 33:17.691
No.

33:17.734 --> 33:20.737
No, there's something
deeper going on here.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.785
I would like to try something.
Is that okay?

33:24.828 --> 33:27.005
-Sure, anything.
-Okay.

33:30.095 --> 33:32.053
I'd like to try
and hypnotize you.

33:33.272 --> 33:35.317
Hypnotize me?

33:35.361 --> 33:39.365
Yes don't worry. I practice
alternative forms of medicine
from time to time.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.977
Do you know the story
of Little Red Riding Hood?

33:43.021 --> 33:45.153
Yeah, who doesn't?

33:45.197 --> 33:51.855
Well, sometimes, we have
to remove the grandmother's skin
to find the wolf beneath it.

33:53.074 --> 33:57.557
What I'd like to do
is crawl just under
the meat of the problem,

33:58.558 --> 34:02.214
to shed the skin, to find
the root of this phenomenon.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.086
Would that be okay?

34:07.958 --> 34:10.918
At this point,
I'll try anything.

34:10.960 --> 34:14.748
Okay, well I need you
to look into my eyes

34:14.791 --> 34:17.402
and pick your hands up
like you are surrendering.

34:18.752 --> 34:23.887
Good, good. Now stare
deep into my eyes

34:23.931 --> 34:26.934
like you're trying to look
to the back of my skull.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.591
Good.

34:31.634 --> 34:35.856
[doctor whispering] Now focus
and let go at the same time.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.639
[clock ticking slowly]

34:38.728 --> 34:40.730
Now tell me, what do you see?

34:42.167 --> 34:43.385
[Elizia] I see men.

34:45.474 --> 34:47.172
[doctor] What kind of men?

34:47.215 --> 34:48.085
Men

34:49.826 --> 34:51.306
controlling me,

34:53.221 --> 34:54.309
harming me.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.094
And how do you feel?

34:59.053 --> 35:00.272
I'm broken,

35:02.012 --> 35:03.101
ashamed,

35:05.190 --> 35:06.321
controlled.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.064
[doctor] What do you see?

35:11.239 --> 35:13.372
[Elizia] I'm face down
in a field,

35:14.503 --> 35:18.725
men in hazmat
suits scanning me,

35:20.683 --> 35:21.815
judging me.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.820
But...

35:26.863 --> 35:32.173
-But...
-[doctor echoing] What?
What is it? What is it?

35:32.217 --> 35:34.480
[Elizia sobbing]
Everything is beautiful.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.961
Everything is white.

35:38.005 --> 35:39.702
[doctor] What do you see?

35:39.746 --> 35:40.529
[Elizia] God.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.532
I see God.

35:45.752 --> 35:48.102
-[clearing her throat]
-What is it? What did I say?

35:48.146 --> 35:51.888
Um, I think you are much better
off to see a specialist.

35:51.932 --> 35:56.328
This is more on the plane
of para-spiritual

35:56.371 --> 35:59.026
than it is physiological.

35:59.069 --> 36:05.075
[clearing her throat] I'd like
you to go see a trusted friend
and advisor, Dr. Flemming.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.468
What does he do?

36:06.512 --> 36:10.124
He's a homeopathic
holistic para-psychiatrist.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.388
And he can help me?

36:13.432 --> 36:14.650
Trust me.

36:15.912 --> 36:17.436
Trust me, my dear.

36:19.829 --> 36:21.788
[soft music playing]

36:41.416 --> 36:44.550
Um, hi. Can I help you?

36:44.593 --> 36:46.987
Why do you keep the crust
on your sandwich?

36:47.030 --> 36:50.208
Because it's wasteful
to throw away the crust.

36:50.251 --> 36:54.473
You don't have to throw it away,
silly. Feed it to the pigeons.

36:54.516 --> 36:56.779
I used to eat it
without the crust.

36:56.823 --> 36:57.911
I know.

36:57.954 --> 36:59.869
[both] It just tastes
better that way.

37:01.610 --> 37:05.179
Don't grow up, throw away
the crust, feed the pigeons.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.963
Do as I do.

37:07.007 --> 37:10.837
Be a fool, be a child.
We are all just children
even after we die.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.550
[soft music continues]

37:54.402 --> 37:55.969
[soft jazz music playing]

38:06.327 --> 38:08.634
[Dr. Flemming] Tell me,
what seems to be the problem?

38:08.677 --> 38:10.026
[Elizia] Everything.

38:10.070 --> 38:12.812
Even more than that. Where
do you want me to start?

38:12.855 --> 38:15.075
From the beginning,
Miss Cummings.

38:15.118 --> 38:17.338
It's Elizia.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.819
From the beginning,
Miss Cummings.

38:19.862 --> 38:23.649
Well, things went crazy
after Fred left.

38:23.692 --> 38:24.606
[Dr. Flemming] Your boyfriend?

38:25.607 --> 38:27.566
Ex-boyfriend, I guess.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.220
It still feels--

38:32.266 --> 38:33.746
just saying that--

38:35.487 --> 38:41.797
He started ranting
about lizards and plants
and secret technology

38:41.841 --> 38:46.149
and he had this tattoo on his
hand that I'd never seen before.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.281
What kind of tattoo?

38:49.936 --> 38:51.329
It was an ear.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.200
[Dr. Flemming] Go on.

38:55.158 --> 38:58.118
Anyway, after that

38:58.161 --> 39:00.947
I started hearing things, I'm

39:01.817 --> 39:02.992
hallucinating.

39:03.036 --> 39:05.255
What do you see?
What do you hear?

39:05.299 --> 39:06.561
Everything.

39:06.605 --> 39:08.868
God, the devil, heaven, hell,

39:08.911 --> 39:11.218
like the guts of the world
have been pulled inside out

39:11.261 --> 39:13.307
and I can see all of its organs.

39:16.005 --> 39:18.573
My friends think I'm crazy.

39:18.617 --> 39:21.837
They say I just need
to get back out there
and start dating again

39:21.881 --> 39:25.537
but all I can find are guys
who are crazier than I am.

39:26.973 --> 39:30.542
I'm spinning
and spinning and I just

39:30.585 --> 39:32.848
need to pedal the other way.

39:33.893 --> 39:34.807
I see.

39:36.243 --> 39:38.245
Do you have a paddle, doctor?

39:41.553 --> 39:44.860
Well, this proverbial turning
the tide of your whirlpool

39:46.035 --> 39:48.168
definitely won't be
an instant fix.

39:51.606 --> 39:53.739
More of a gradual change.

39:53.782 --> 39:59.048
There's no magical bean
or bullet or a pill that you can
just swallow for this one.

40:00.789 --> 40:03.270
You see life is like exercise.

40:03.313 --> 40:07.709
In order to stay fit
and healthy you have
to diet and work out and

40:08.884 --> 40:11.060
change will come in time,

40:11.104 --> 40:12.758
gradually massaging
the problems

40:12.801 --> 40:15.804
and curbing the waters.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.458
But there's always
that first step.

40:18.546 --> 40:20.461
So what's mine?

40:20.505 --> 40:21.854
What's my first step?

40:23.682 --> 40:24.509
Refocus.

40:25.684 --> 40:28.774
You must refocus
your energy from Fred.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.732
Put it on something else.

40:30.776 --> 40:31.646
Like what?

40:32.647 --> 40:33.735
It's up to you.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.565
It could be a hobby,

40:37.609 --> 40:38.436
bird-watching,

40:39.524 --> 40:40.916
fish-watching.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.657
It could be a thing.

40:42.701 --> 40:46.008
Do you like collecting? Do you
collect anything, Miss Cummings?

40:47.488 --> 40:49.229
I don't know.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.274
What do people collect?

40:51.318 --> 40:54.234
Anything; coins, stamps,

40:55.278 --> 40:57.455
comics, cars, knick-knacks,

40:58.412 --> 40:59.152
gnomes.

40:59.195 --> 41:00.196
Gnomes?

41:00.240 --> 41:02.460
Yes, gnomes.

41:04.505 --> 41:06.333
Gnomes.

41:06.376 --> 41:07.508
[Dr. Flemming] Find something.

41:09.205 --> 41:11.599
Focus on it.
Something that calls to you.

41:12.992 --> 41:14.080
That's your first step.

41:17.257 --> 41:18.388
Gnomes.

41:20.608 --> 41:23.350
[whispering]

41:38.844 --> 41:40.715
[heavenly singing]

41:44.327 --> 41:46.460
[soft jazz music playing]

41:49.158 --> 41:50.203
I'm broken.

41:51.726 --> 41:53.641
How do you mean?

41:53.685 --> 41:57.471
I mean I've tried everything:
dating, hypnosis,
doctors, psychotherapy.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.952
Nothing's working.
I'm broken, unfixable.

41:59.995 --> 42:02.520
Oh Humpty Dumpty
fell off her wall?

42:03.695 --> 42:06.785
Look Ellie, I just think
you're letting this breakup
get the best of you.

42:06.828 --> 42:10.832
You don't understand.
Something was planted
in my brain that keeps growing

42:10.876 --> 42:14.749
and growing until one day
my head is going to explode.

42:14.793 --> 42:16.621
Oh brother!

42:16.664 --> 42:19.406
[Elizia] Do you know the Church
of the Transfiguration?

42:19.449 --> 42:21.408
No.

42:21.451 --> 42:27.545
There's this old church
on St. August Street
downtown. It's been calling me.

42:27.588 --> 42:28.937
Calling you?

42:28.981 --> 42:29.764
Yes.

42:31.505 --> 42:34.247
It has a glowing door that
keeps whispering my name.

42:34.290 --> 42:37.990
I've been going there a lot
at night just standing there,

42:38.991 --> 42:39.905
listening.

42:42.603 --> 42:45.258
You need some serious help.
You know that, right?

42:45.301 --> 42:49.610
I know, that's what I'm saying.
I'm hearing these things,
I'm seeing these things

42:49.654 --> 42:52.700
and nothing
is working. I'm broken.

42:52.744 --> 42:54.833
Beth, maybe we should...

42:56.138 --> 42:57.836
I don't know.

42:57.879 --> 42:58.837
Maybe what?

43:00.142 --> 43:03.232
Well, remember when me
and Beth lost pops?

43:03.276 --> 43:05.713
[Elizia] Yeah, you guys were
really broken up about it.

43:05.757 --> 43:08.411
Yeah I OD'ed, almost died.

43:08.455 --> 43:10.326
It was some scary shit.

43:11.197 --> 43:12.894
Feels like forever ago.

43:12.938 --> 43:14.983
Five years ago.

43:15.027 --> 43:17.377
Well, we ran off to Nevada...

43:17.420 --> 43:19.292
That healing retreat.

43:19.335 --> 43:24.079
Oh yeah, you guys came back
like new. Do you think
I should do that?

43:24.123 --> 43:27.692
Mm, it really was
a bunch of bullshit.

43:27.735 --> 43:29.389
Ten thousand dollars worth.

43:29.432 --> 43:31.130
There's no way
you could afford that.

43:31.173 --> 43:33.611
Not without rich parents,
right Davey?

43:35.221 --> 43:39.442
Anyway, they did
give us one thing.

43:39.486 --> 43:41.836
-One thing.
-One thing?

43:41.880 --> 43:44.578
One thing that flipped
the switch.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.058
Turned the dial.

43:46.101 --> 43:50.279
Turned on the light and we
were out of the darkness.

43:50.323 --> 43:53.108
So what was it?

43:53.152 --> 43:56.590
A secret, a word, a meditation?

43:57.591 --> 43:58.636
Yahey.

44:00.246 --> 44:01.987
Yahey?

44:02.030 --> 44:02.988
Ayahuasca.

44:04.729 --> 44:06.382
I'm confused.

44:06.426 --> 44:08.646
Hallucinogenics,
they tripped balls.

44:08.689 --> 44:13.738
Come on you guys, I need to be
healed, not more fucked up.

44:13.781 --> 44:18.220
[Dave] I'm serious Ellie, it
really opened some doors for us.

44:18.264 --> 44:19.744
[Beth] It's at least
worth a try.

44:22.007 --> 44:22.921
What the hell?

44:23.965 --> 44:25.880
I have nothing to lose.

44:25.924 --> 44:27.316
Atta girl.

44:36.021 --> 44:39.415
Okay, here, you're gonna
take this and you're
gonna drink just a little--

44:42.984 --> 44:43.768
Okay.

44:45.073 --> 44:48.250
Right, now just lay back
and keep your eyes open.

44:49.121 --> 44:51.079
You're just gonna try
to clear your mind.

44:55.257 --> 44:57.346
[distant growling,
whispering and blabbing]

45:14.363 --> 45:16.061
[phone ringing]

45:36.690 --> 45:39.084
[heart beating]

45:44.002 --> 45:46.091
[distant bells ringing]

46:02.281 --> 46:03.804
[screaming]

46:08.069 --> 46:09.723
[distant talking]

46:10.855 --> 46:12.595
[Dave] It's okay,
you're all right.

46:13.727 --> 46:14.902
[Beth] You'll be okay.

46:16.774 --> 46:19.080
[Dave] You're all right,
we're here.

46:20.516 --> 46:22.127
Oh Ellie.

46:22.170 --> 46:23.171
Okay.

46:24.956 --> 46:27.219
Breathe.

46:27.262 --> 46:30.483
[narrator] Notice how the
caterpillars are the very
picture of concentration.

46:30.526 --> 46:36.271
Their focus is absolute,
rendering them completely
oblivious to any danger,

46:36.315 --> 46:42.538
any lurking predator to anything outside the world of this leaf.

46:42.582 --> 46:44.540
Eating is all there is.

46:44.584 --> 46:45.803
[knocking on the door]

46:46.716 --> 46:47.892
[exhaling]

46:47.935 --> 46:51.330
Not a good time. Leave me alone.

47:01.514 --> 47:04.169
[silly voice] Hey, down here.

47:04.212 --> 47:06.040
It's me Snickers.

47:06.084 --> 47:08.608
Oh no, no, no.

47:08.651 --> 47:10.392
[Snickers] It's cool,
we just need to talk.

47:10.436 --> 47:11.829
You need to leave.

47:11.872 --> 47:14.135
Oh no, no, that's not gonna
happen. We need to talk.

47:14.179 --> 47:17.791
No, you need to leave,
you need to leave, you need
to leave, right now.

47:17.835 --> 47:22.970
[Snickers] We absolutely need
to talk. Let me ask you,
why Elizia?

47:23.014 --> 47:24.232
Why what?

47:24.276 --> 47:26.017
[Snickers] Why are you
so mad at me?

47:26.060 --> 47:27.453
Mad at you?

47:27.496 --> 47:29.977
Yes, and you've been speaking
the secret language.

47:30.021 --> 47:31.500
Secret language?

47:31.544 --> 47:34.547
For the world. The secret
language of the heavenlies.

47:34.590 --> 47:37.419
Oh no, I only speak English.

47:37.463 --> 47:42.076
I'm not a resident of another
plane or planet and you,

47:42.120 --> 47:45.079
you heard wrong and you
need-- I need you to go.

47:45.123 --> 47:46.254
What you got there?

47:47.647 --> 47:49.692
-This?
-Mom's brownies?

47:49.736 --> 47:52.086
[Lilith's voice]
Chocolate will kill you.

47:52.130 --> 47:53.696
Do you want some?

47:53.740 --> 47:56.961
[Snickers] Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Mom never lets me have any.

47:58.832 --> 48:00.094
Eat up.

48:00.138 --> 48:03.445
Argh! Yes, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

50:22.497 --> 50:24.151
[phone calling]

50:28.112 --> 50:28.982
[Elizia's mom] Hello?

50:30.114 --> 50:33.117
Ellie? Baby, is that you?

50:33.160 --> 50:36.337
[Elizia] Mom, can I come home?

50:36.381 --> 50:38.252
[Elizia's mom] Of course, dear.

50:49.481 --> 50:52.092
Honey, what's wrong?

50:52.136 --> 50:53.789
Why did you come home?

50:53.833 --> 50:56.966
Nothing. No reason. I'm fine.

50:57.010 --> 51:00.187
But honey, you were crying,
sobbing last night.

51:00.231 --> 51:01.971
On the phone,
you were sobbing.

51:02.015 --> 51:06.019
Mom, can't I just come home and
see my mom every now and then?

51:10.371 --> 51:12.417
I don't know, I had
to get away for a bit.

51:13.505 --> 51:15.333
Well, honey, I know.

51:15.376 --> 51:19.293
Sunday is tomorrow, we'll go to
church, see Pastor Hanley speak.

51:20.642 --> 51:23.080
Sure mom, that sounds great.

51:32.741 --> 51:35.527
[Elizia's mom] I set up your
old room for you to sleep.

51:36.789 --> 51:38.573
It looks like you
could use some rest.

53:12.276 --> 53:15.017
Do you know the healing
capabilities of crystals?

53:15.061 --> 53:18.282
The sacred bonds
of wolf and man?

53:18.325 --> 53:22.068
The pure energy of light
and the laying on of hands?

53:22.111 --> 53:24.853
There are forces
beyond our control!

53:24.897 --> 53:27.595
Forces that have
controlled our way of life!

53:27.639 --> 53:30.511
They're seeding the clouds
with false memories.

53:32.034 --> 53:37.431
We are already dead, people,
and the rain has washed away
all memory of our passing.

53:37.475 --> 53:41.174
Open your eyes,
open your hearts!

53:41.218 --> 53:44.438
Rip open the veil and peer
into your new world.

53:44.482 --> 53:47.876
You're new world,
the real world!

53:56.842 --> 53:58.757
So how was it, at your mom's?

53:59.888 --> 54:02.935
I don't know. Weird.

54:02.978 --> 54:05.677
Things are weird
no matter where I go.

54:05.720 --> 54:06.982
Sorry, Elle.

54:07.026 --> 54:10.290
I just-- I don't know
what to do anymore.

54:11.378 --> 54:14.729
There are motivational
speakers. They help people.

54:16.340 --> 54:19.691
Tony Robbins, Richard
Simmons; people like that.

54:19.734 --> 54:24.261
Dave, do you think the
government is seeding the
clouds with weird chemicals?

54:25.827 --> 54:26.567
What?

I'm a better person.

Because of her I will never
leave the one that I love.

It's an old convent.

01:31:37.579 --> 01:31:40.625

It was in all the papers.

01:31:42.584 --> 01:31:45.848

one of the nuns got trapped
in the bell tower

01:31:45.891 --> 01:31:47.414
and burned alive.

01:31:47.458 --> 01:31:51.418

never rebuilt that church.
