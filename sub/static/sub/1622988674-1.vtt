01:38.224 --> 01:41.852
<i>I once heard an old proverb
about hunting. It goes like this:</i>

01:43.437 --> 01:46.649
<i>"Lions are born knowing they're predators.</i>

01:46.732 --> 01:49.944
<i>Antelopes understand that they are prey.</i>

01:51.112 --> 01:55.241
<i>Humans are the only creatures
on Earth given a choice."</i>

01:55.324 --> 01:56.867
<i>I don't know who said that,</i>

01:56.951 --> 02:01.956
<i>but I'm pretty sure they never imagined
a place like Pensacola.</i>

02:11.257 --> 02:13.676
<i>This morning,
a $5,000 reward is being offered</i>

02:13.759 --> 02:15.511
<i>by the family of Lucy Baylor,</i>

02:15.594 --> 02:19.140
<i>a 16-year-old Pensacola girl who
disappeared last week.</i>

02:19.223 --> 02:21.517
<i>Investigators for the county
sheriff's department</i>

02:21.600 --> 02:23.811
<i>said in a press conference
Tuesday morning</i>

02:23.894 --> 02:27.023
<i>that there are people they'd like
to talk to about the disappearance,</i>

02:27.106 --> 02:29.567
<i>but said
they are not necessarily suspects.</i>

03:28.250 --> 03:29.668
Holy Christ!

04:04.286 --> 04:08.916
<i>Victim is a Caucasian
female approximately 20 years old...</i>

04:08.999 --> 04:11.585
<i>Trauma due to...</i>

04:56.213 --> 04:58.174
I didn't know
they'd called y'all already.

04:58.257 --> 05:02.344
No, I was just a bit east of here.
Thought I'd have a look.

05:02.428 --> 05:04.054
Be my guest.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.239
Yeah, it looks like he dragged her
from the road.

05:24.950 --> 05:30.080
No. She was killed at a primary location
and dumped here last night.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.082
How the hell can you
reckon that from here?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.085
You got an ID?

05:36.378 --> 05:37.505
Sarah Kellogg.

05:38.506 --> 05:42.510
Twenty-six, couple of possessions,
couple of solicitations.

05:42.593 --> 05:46.597
Last known was Tallahassee.
Can't find the missing report.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.353
- How's your wife?
- Pain in the ass as usual.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.274
Get high resolution pictures
of those bite marks

05:57.358 --> 05:59.777
- before the heat hits triple digits.
- Yeah.

06:00.778 --> 06:03.572
- You still owe me a beer.
- Yeah, I know.

06:21.799 --> 06:25.636
Hey, no more coke
till I see some titties in this room.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.846
Shut the fuck up, Walton!

06:27.930 --> 06:31.141
Shut the fucking door, bitch!

06:31.225 --> 06:32.851
Tracey, get out of here.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.807
Evening, ma'am. Care to join me
for some pancakes?

08:14.328 --> 08:15.829
You need a friend, little girl?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.249
Come on, let's get you out of the rain.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.377
Hey, where you going?

08:21.460 --> 08:25.005
Hey! Ah!

08:25.089 --> 08:26.215
Don't make me chase, huh?

08:30.761 --> 08:32.304
You all right?

08:33.554 --> 08:34.556
Hey, you all right?

08:39.436 --> 08:42.981
Come on. Come on, let's get you
somewhere safe.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.900
Come on.

08:53.117 --> 08:55.661
<i>Don't fuck
with me tonight, Karl. Fuck you.</i>

08:55.828 --> 08:59.540
- I just do my job. That's it.
- <i>Why don't we switch places?</i>

08:59.623 --> 09:01.667
<i>How about you come in here
and shake your ass</i>

09:01.750 --> 09:04.586
<i>and I'll sit in the car
and eat fucking burritos all night?</i>

09:04.670 --> 09:06.213
I think your guy's here.

09:08.132 --> 09:09.800
Copy that, Karl.

09:19.143 --> 09:20.519
Knock, knock.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.859
Oh, you've got to be
the stupidest bitch in Pensacola.

09:28.569 --> 09:29.820
You remember me?

09:31.447 --> 09:32.990
I see a lot of people, baby.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.492
Not like me, you don't.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.287
You're sexy as fuck!

09:38.370 --> 09:40.539
Don't worry, I sent
your goofy-ass little date packing,

09:40.622 --> 09:42.958
so I don't think we'll be disturbed.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.756
I caught you back in Loxley, didn't I?

09:52.551 --> 09:55.220
Which makes this second offense
punishable, doesn't it?

09:57.890 --> 09:59.433
Shit.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.102
<i>This is not our target.</i>

10:05.814 --> 10:08.358
Well, this is my beautiful universe.

10:10.736 --> 10:13.781
And every fucking thing in it...

10:16.742 --> 10:18.410
belongs to me.

10:18.494 --> 10:21.079
Just like Earth to God.

10:21.163 --> 10:21.997
What?

10:22.080 --> 10:25.083
So that means all of you working bitches

10:25.167 --> 10:27.377
belong to me too.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.338
You understand what I'm saying?

10:29.421 --> 10:31.215
<i>Fuck this, I'm coming in.</i>

10:31.298 --> 10:32.216
No.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.307
Okay.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.061
So you're one of those bitches, huh?

10:44.144 --> 10:46.021
Can't hear unless bleeding. Well.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.858
<i>I'm coming in.
This is not our target.</i>

10:49.942 --> 10:52.402
- Just give me two minutes.
- For what?

10:52.486 --> 10:54.404
You gonna do your makeup? Hm?

10:56.949 --> 10:58.575
'Cause what's gonna happen...

11:00.202 --> 11:02.496
doesn't have shit to do
with looking pretty.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.585
Now, lift up that skirt...

11:08.669 --> 11:10.712
and bend.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.132
No.

11:18.929 --> 11:19.972
Okay.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.854
Look what I got.

11:26.937 --> 11:31.525
Now, I could put you in a dumpster
and feed you to the little piggies.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.901
And you know what else?

11:33.902 --> 11:36.113
Nobody would give a fuck!

11:38.532 --> 11:42.119
Okay.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.288
What about you?

11:44.371 --> 11:47.374
Too much of Daddy kicking Mommy
around the trailer park?

11:54.798 --> 11:57.009
Ah!

12:07.352 --> 12:09.730
- No!
- Ah!

12:12.524 --> 12:14.151
- What did you do?
- It's not him.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.903
Goddamn it!

12:17.237 --> 12:18.697
- Oh, Karl.
- You promised me!

12:18.780 --> 12:20.490
What the fuck did you want me to do, Karl?

12:20.574 --> 12:22.117
He was beating the shit out of me!

12:22.200 --> 12:25.329
- This is gonna be bad.
- Karl...

12:25.412 --> 12:28.332
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- Okay, let's go.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.834
Oh, fuck.

12:30.918 --> 12:35.255
<i>As we walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,</i>

12:35.339 --> 12:38.842
<i>we see temptation all around us.</i>

12:38.926 --> 12:42.137
<i>Who among us is not tempted
by the earthly delights</i>

12:42.220 --> 12:45.891
<i>of fornication, intoxication,
and the like?</i>

12:45.974 --> 12:48.268
<i>Who among us is immune</i>

12:48.352 --> 12:53.315
<i>to the urge to partake
in such gratification?</i>

12:53.398 --> 12:57.277
- <i>Who among us...</i>
- That's my daughter. Bethany.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.783
Heading home to see her now.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.957
You wanna stay with us tonight?

13:15.420 --> 13:17.089
My daughter would love you.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.426
Yes.

13:23.387 --> 13:24.554
Please.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.558
Well, it's settled then.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.469
<i>I understand this
is emotional for you, Byron.</i>

14:04.553 --> 14:06.263
<i>It's not about emotion.</i>

14:06.346 --> 14:09.683
Well, shit, we all got
our nuts kicked in over this shit.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.269
And truth is, you still young.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.647
And you too good a lawman to get wrapped
around the axle over just one case.

14:15.731 --> 14:19.443
Oh, excuse me. Seven unsolved murders
is more than one case, sir.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.278
You know we can't confirm
those connections.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.072
Listen, the Sarah Kellogg scene,
it matches, sir.

14:24.156 --> 14:26.867
The bite marks, the positioning,
the profile, everything.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.910
Let me bottom line this, Byron.

14:28.994 --> 14:31.705
- You can't reopen this.
- Excuse me?

14:31.788 --> 14:33.749
- You've been moved to something else.
- When?

14:33.832 --> 14:37.461
- Right now.
- Okay. Let's... let's engage the FBI.

14:37.544 --> 14:41.048
- A multi-jurisdictional capital offender.
- You're joking, right?

14:41.131 --> 14:44.509
You gotta move on. We don't have a choice.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.137
All right.

14:48.764 --> 14:51.433
You know, nobody's ever stood up
for those girls.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.856
And I just can't seem
to reconcile that no more.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.710
Headquarters is frustrated.

15:18.794 --> 15:20.504
He is fucking lucky to be alive.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.672
They pulled the plug on us.

15:22.756 --> 15:28.053
Operation Safe Highway
is moving out of Florida.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.554
- When?
- Now.

15:29.638 --> 15:33.016
On to Interstate 5
in the beautiful northwest.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.519
No, you go to headquarters
and you tell them to fuck off.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.687
It's not your operation.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.147
The minute I got made bait and trap,

15:39.231 --> 15:41.483
it became my operation
and you fucking know that!

15:41.566 --> 15:44.236
There's nothing I can do.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.488
Okay, look, Karl,
last night's fuck-up was on me.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.740
Okay? I fucked up. I'm sorry.

15:48.824 --> 15:51.368
I have communication
with over a dozen active offenders

15:51.451 --> 15:53.328
who are chasing down these girls.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.622
My biggest target is lined up for tonight.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.082
I'm tired of having this conversation.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.876
I'm doing that fucking sting tonight.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.130
- Bullshit!
- Watch me.

16:05.966 --> 16:06.925
<i>The sheriff's department</i>

16:07.008 --> 16:08.802
<i>is working closely
with state law enforcement</i>

16:08.885 --> 16:11.513
<i>to determine if there's a connection
between this case</i>

16:11.596 --> 16:14.057
<i>and a string of similar abduction cases</i>

16:14.141 --> 16:17.686
<i>that have occurred along the I-10 corridor
in recent months.</i>

16:17.769 --> 16:20.522
<i>A spokesperson for the county
said that they cannot comment,</i>

16:20.605 --> 16:23.024
<i>as this is an ongoing investigation.</i>

16:23.108 --> 16:25.902
<i>They are asking anyone
with information to come forward.</i>

16:49.634 --> 16:53.471
- Help you?
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.098
My name is Byron Crawford.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.851
You hear to purchase the property,
Mr. Crawford? Well, it ain't for sale.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.019
No, ma'am.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.105
I'm with the Florida State Police, and...

17:03.481 --> 17:05.901
May I ask if you're related
to Sarah Kellogg?

17:12.531 --> 17:16.328
Some prick cop called asking
some downright rude questions.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.788
Said they found her outside Pensacola.

17:18.872 --> 17:22.834
I apologize, ma'am.
It shouldn't have happened that way.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.088
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.761
You drove all the way down here
just to tell me my daughter been killed?

17:33.762 --> 17:34.763
Yes, ma'am.

17:35.889 --> 17:39.893
That's how it should be.
I'm sorry you heard otherwise.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.023
You might as well come
and sit for a while.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.165
This the part where you tell me
you ain't gonna rest

18:02.249 --> 18:04.542
till you catch the son of a bitch
that killed Sarah?

18:04.626 --> 18:06.211
Uh, no, ma'am.

18:07.295 --> 18:10.590
Anybody that telling you that
is, uh, telling you a lie.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.926
Odds are against us in a big way.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.556
Well, don't beat around the bush
or nothing, Mr. Crawford.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.141
Shit!

18:20.225 --> 18:22.435
I guess I appreciate the honesty.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.565
Maybe I will take you up
on that drink after all.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.860
Good move.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.446
Some days it's best to be drinking.

18:33.530 --> 18:34.864
Yeah.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.034
You from the Panhandle,
Mr. Crawford?

18:38.118 --> 18:41.579
- No, not far, up in Marianna.
- Ooh.

18:49.379 --> 18:53.758
Y'all always been, uh, 'round Tallahassee?

18:55.343 --> 18:56.761
Tallahassee? Shit.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.764
Family's been in this house
damn near 100 years.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.518
That's me and my twin sister, Caroline.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.188
I still remember getting
that picture taken.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.400
My mother could not stop fussing
with those damn dresses.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.237
Ma died that summer,
Coltier factory fire in Thomasville.

19:14.321 --> 19:17.073
Oh, that's terrible, I'm sorry.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.118
My father was wounded in Korea.

19:21.369 --> 19:26.249
After my mother died,
it was like a switch flipped in his mind.

19:28.710 --> 19:29.961
He would drink.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.381
Started in the morning
and be talking to himself

19:33.465 --> 19:36.801
by the time we got home
from school.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.054
Scared the hell out of me.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.765
We'd run and hide in the switchgrass.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.435
<i>We'd play for hours.</i>

19:46.936 --> 19:48.146
<i>It'd get dark.</i>

19:49.147 --> 19:50.607
<i>We never noticed.</i>

19:55.278 --> 19:57.030
Until he'd come out for us...

20:00.033 --> 20:02.911
angry like a crazed dog.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.373
I can still hear his voice.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.208
Sometimes, he caught us.

20:11.586 --> 20:13.213
Sometimes, he didn't.

20:17.801 --> 20:18.927
We'd just wait.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.640
Just had to wait.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.979
"Till the clock strikes midnight,"
Caroline would say.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.109
Just like Cinderella.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.280
Can I get you a beer instead?

20:39.364 --> 20:41.366
No, ma'am, I'm...

20:42.367 --> 20:43.660
I'm fine.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.499
Sarah reminded me so much of Caroline.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.170
Both always looking to escape.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.131
And shitty taste in men.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.633
Sarah had a steady boyfriend?

21:00.969 --> 21:03.513
Hell, I wouldn't even know.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.682
She'd been gone damn near a year.

21:07.684 --> 21:08.518
Well...

21:12.105 --> 21:13.440
I'm gonna get out of here.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.651
But, um...

21:18.903 --> 21:20.238
if you need anything...

21:22.532 --> 21:24.325
just give me a call.

21:31.791 --> 21:35.295
- How'd she die?
- Excuse me?

21:36.421 --> 21:39.799
You know, how was Sarah killed?

21:49.058 --> 21:51.436
Well, then can I ask you a favor, Mr.
Crawford?

21:55.315 --> 22:00.111
By the grace of God,
someone happens to catch this...

22:01.863 --> 22:04.365
devil that killed my baby girl,

22:04.449 --> 22:07.160
will you come back and knock on this door?

22:09.787 --> 22:11.706
Good evening, ma'am.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.709
Ooh!

22:56.793 --> 22:58.920
Oh! Who's that?

22:59.003 --> 23:01.256
Hi, babe.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.341
Aw...

23:05.552 --> 23:07.637
- Lord, I'm so blessed.
- Mwah.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.598
Is that Daddy?

23:10.682 --> 23:14.394
- How was your day?
- Oh, you don't wanna know.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.606
I got two phone calls this morning.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.193
The first was a missing person's report.

23:22.277 --> 23:28.074
Sixteen-year-old girl vanished from
a truck stop outside Pensacola last night.

23:30.660 --> 23:35.707
And before that, a concrete salesman found
a dead body off I-10 by the state line.

23:35.790 --> 23:38.501
- Was it her?
- Nope.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.753
Just some prostitute
from East Tallahassee.

23:40.837 --> 23:43.548
This job...

23:46.634 --> 23:50.972
I used to feel God's presence, but now...

23:51.055 --> 23:53.433
I don't know.

23:53.516 --> 23:57.562
You've got His love in your heart.
You know that.

23:58.563 --> 24:02.734
And that's why these girls
need someone like you.

24:03.860 --> 24:06.321
- I have faith in you.
- Mm...

24:11.659 --> 24:13.953
Is it burning, Mommy?

24:14.037 --> 24:17.123
No, honey, it's just steam
from the hot water.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.171
Mm.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.131
- Good timing.
- Smells good.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.719
Elbows off the table.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.221
Now, what you reading now?

24:32.305 --> 24:34.515
It's called <i>Watership Down.</i>

24:34.599 --> 24:38.478
You gotta be the smartest
eight-year-old in the whole Panhandle.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.438
She's awfully young for that book.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.530
What we got?

24:49.614 --> 24:53.493
- Meatloaf! My favorite.
- Loaf, corn.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.809
- This is gonna be bad.
- Feel free to leave any time.

25:17.892 --> 25:21.062
- Nobody's forcing you to stay.
- We could lose our badges.

25:21.145 --> 25:25.191
We're not gonna lose our badges, Karl.
I've been working this guy since Loxley.

25:25.274 --> 25:29.112
- Call the locals.
- Nobody gives a fuck about these girls.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.615
You know that. If nobody's looking
for you, then you're not really missing.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.909
I don't want you to get hurt.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.203
- Okay.
- I mean it.

25:37.286 --> 25:39.539
Okay, fine, this will be the last one.
Okay?

25:39.622 --> 25:41.708
And then we'll pack up and we'll go
to rainy-ass Seattle.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.878
- I'm not going.
- What?

25:45.962 --> 25:49.590
- Kirsten's gonna divorce me.
- Bullshit.

25:49.674 --> 25:52.677
She got a fucking attorney.

25:52.760 --> 25:56.055
Karl, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

26:03.271 --> 26:06.774
Fuck it. He's a no-show.
Let's get out of here.

26:10.403 --> 26:13.072
Johnson's still out sick. I'm gonna have
to ride his load up to Mobile.

26:14.073 --> 26:17.160
Tonight? Pete, we were gonna do
that bookshelf.

26:17.243 --> 26:21.164
I know, baby, but there's just so many
jobs right now, and not enough drivers.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.583
You know, we're out here
in the middle of nowhere

26:23.666 --> 26:25.752
with two neighbors we barely know.

26:25.835 --> 26:30.089
Well, this is why we got full bellies
right now, ain't it?

26:30.173 --> 26:32.842
Just seems to be happening
an awful lot lately.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.678
You wanted me off the road.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.597
A manager has to be available, honey.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.602
Just get a bit lonely out here sometimes.

26:42.685 --> 26:44.312
Mm-hmm.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.814
And I can't help but miss you, Pete.

26:46.898 --> 26:47.815
Aw...

26:52.153 --> 26:55.072
I'll wake you up when I get home.
All right?

26:55.156 --> 26:57.867
- Promise?
- Mm-hmm.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.244
I'll quit if you want.

27:00.328 --> 27:01.621
- I will.
- No, you wouldn't.

27:01.704 --> 27:03.164
Hell, yeah, I'll quit right now.

27:03.247 --> 27:06.375
- You want me to quit?
- No, don't do that.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.878
All right.

27:08.961 --> 27:12.089
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

27:12.173 --> 27:14.467
- Drive safe.
- Love you, baby.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.219
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, baby.

27:18.763 --> 27:20.848
All right. Bye.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.104
Lose your key?

28:10.898 --> 28:13.442
Oh, don't be shy,
handsome.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.278
Why don't you come have a drink?

28:20.116 --> 28:22.201
I could use the company.

28:22.285 --> 28:23.828
All right.

28:25.079 --> 28:26.289
Why not?

28:44.432 --> 28:46.893
You ain't no cop, right?

28:57.820 --> 28:58.946
How old are you?

29:00.031 --> 29:01.908
Twenty.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.584
I sure do love this song.

29:24.889 --> 29:27.642
Be much obliged if you danced
with me, sugar.

29:58.923 --> 30:01.425
Yeah, that's about it.

30:01.509 --> 30:02.969
You a good girl?

30:03.970 --> 30:05.638
What's that, hon?

30:09.266 --> 30:10.726
You a good girl?

30:11.852 --> 30:13.771
Mm-hmm.

30:41.799 --> 30:44.385
You're a dirty little girl, aren't you?

30:52.935 --> 30:56.480
You're a dirty, disgusting prostitute!

31:33.726 --> 31:36.604
It's okay.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.731
Whoo!

31:39.899 --> 31:40.941
Oh, man.

32:15.392 --> 32:17.812
There you are, Mr. Ball.

32:22.817 --> 32:24.860
I wonder if there's anything in here.

32:35.329 --> 32:38.749
Bethany!
Come on in, dear! Time for dinner!

32:39.917 --> 32:41.293
Coming, Mommy.

32:45.631 --> 32:49.009
Help! Is anybody there?

33:50.821 --> 33:53.574
It's a restricted area.
Boss ordered a lockdown.

33:53.657 --> 33:55.826
- Who's in charge over here?
- Detective Yarborough.

33:55.910 --> 33:56.911
Thank you.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.454
Hey, you gotta sign
the security log. Come on!

33:58.537 --> 34:02.082
- Don't take it personally, kid.
- Shit.

34:02.166 --> 34:03.500
Whoa, whoa!

34:03.584 --> 34:06.962
Did I miss a jurisdiction
reassignment, my friend?

34:07.046 --> 34:08.630
Nope. Just having a look.

34:08.714 --> 34:12.176
Uh-huh. Why do I get the feeling that you
ain't being honest with me, Crawford?

34:12.259 --> 34:13.969
And that's no <i>bueno</i> at my crime scene.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.138
I'm being honest with you.
I'm just out here...

34:16.222 --> 34:17.973
Excuse me. Are you in charge here?

34:18.056 --> 34:20.059
- Get these bozos outta here!
- Hey, buddy.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.268
We're the FBI.

34:22.268 --> 34:26.982
Well, nice to meet y'all, but what the
hell do you want at my crime scene?

34:27.065 --> 34:31.237
We target assholes who hunt underage,
potentially trafficked girls.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.572
Well, listen,
I appreciate the efforts you making

34:34.657 --> 34:36.574
in our little part of the world.

34:36.659 --> 34:39.411
- But why are we talking here?
- We had set up

34:39.495 --> 34:41.455
a low visibility prostitution sting
here last night.

34:41.538 --> 34:43.666
The sheriff's office never mentioned
anything to me.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.793
It's not a perfect science.

34:45.876 --> 34:47.002
Well, obviously not, all right?

34:47.085 --> 34:50.755
Because I got a 20-year-old girl
with her skull cracked in six places.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.969
This target last night, he have a name?

34:56.053 --> 34:58.889
Okay, no, no. This has gone
far enough, all right?

34:58.973 --> 35:03.394
Protocol dictates that my lieutenant
talks to y'all superior. Okay?

35:03.477 --> 35:06.021
So quit while you're ahead, sweetheart.

35:22.705 --> 35:25.708
- I killed that girl.
- I hope you're kidding.

35:25.791 --> 35:29.628
No, I mean, that should've been me,
I'm supposed to be protecting these girls.

35:29.712 --> 35:32.965
Bullshit! You could have died last night.

35:33.048 --> 35:36.677
Hi. My name is Byron Crawford,

35:36.760 --> 35:38.721
and I'm an agent with the FDLE.

35:39.722 --> 35:43.809
You said this target had no-show
at a scheduled meeting before?

35:43.892 --> 35:47.855
- Uh, where was that?
- A few nights ago.

35:47.938 --> 35:51.483
The Oasis Motel. Pensacola.

35:52.776 --> 35:54.862
I was afraid of that.

35:54.945 --> 35:58.407
A young woman reported
that her 16-year-old sister went missing.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.243
Thursday night outside the Oasis.

36:01.327 --> 36:03.829
I'd love to hear anything else
you got on this guy.

36:03.912 --> 36:07.458
If you remember anything else
from that night or, uh...

36:07.541 --> 36:10.502
get any additional info
on the suspect, you know,

36:10.586 --> 36:12.171
give me a shout.

38:49.495 --> 38:52.331
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, baby.

38:52.414 --> 38:55.417
Working on the bookshelf?
Mama will be so happy.

38:55.501 --> 38:56.752
Let me help you.

38:58.962 --> 39:02.132
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too, Daddy.

39:02.216 --> 39:04.218
I love you so much.

39:07.179 --> 39:09.515
- Come on, let's go play.
- Mm-hmm.

39:09.598 --> 39:10.891
All right.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.572
I think I saw that girl at the Oasis.

39:25.656 --> 39:29.409
<i>She was walking to the service center,
like a zombie.</i>

39:29.493 --> 39:31.620
<i>How about you come
in here and shake your ass</i>

39:31.703 --> 39:33.914
<i>and I'll sit in the car
and eat fucking burritos all night?</i>

39:33.997 --> 39:36.375
<i>I didn't think too much of it.</i>

39:36.458 --> 39:39.044
And then that assault came in.

39:39.127 --> 39:40.796
Christ.

39:43.632 --> 39:44.591
Well...

39:46.718 --> 39:48.720
We'll get him tomorrow.

40:19.126 --> 40:20.294
Get up.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.759
Wash your arms and legs off
with the sponge.

40:36.518 --> 40:37.728
Do it.

40:38.895 --> 40:41.106
Now!

40:43.567 --> 40:46.236
I can't see. I can't...

40:46.320 --> 40:48.447
I can't see!

40:52.159 --> 40:55.203
It's right here, sweetheart.
Here we go.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.247
Here we go. Come here.

40:59.916 --> 41:01.168
Okay.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.221
Is that better?

41:16.058 --> 41:17.476
Use the sponge. Here.

41:32.282 --> 41:34.660
- Hello.
- Hey.

41:34.743 --> 41:39.081
- What can I get you, man?
- I'll have what she's having. Thanks.

41:39.164 --> 41:43.710
First time the FBI voluntarily showed up
around this stretch, huh?

41:43.794 --> 41:47.172
Doesn't seem to be a shortage
in crime, does there?

41:47.255 --> 41:50.801
Well, I appreciate you reaching out.

41:50.884 --> 41:52.594
I'm gonna give you some background.

41:52.678 --> 41:55.847
Couple years ago,
I got assigned two Jane Doe cases.

41:55.931 --> 41:58.558
Both drug-friendly truck stop prostitutes.

41:58.642 --> 42:03.939
<i>Both dumped off the I-10.
Both strangled, assaulted, bitten,</i>

42:04.022 --> 42:07.234
and bodies suggestively staged
in view from the highway.

42:07.317 --> 42:10.278
Now, nobody wanted to touch it.

42:10.362 --> 42:12.614
Just an impossible to get around.

42:13.615 --> 42:15.242
And then another body turned up.

42:15.325 --> 42:18.495
<i>And then another.</i>

42:18.578 --> 42:20.497
<i>Until we had six.</i>

42:20.580 --> 42:23.792
And a bona fide serial killer.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.585
Who worked that for the Bureau?

42:25.669 --> 42:30.132
A whip-smart analyst
with the state bureau built the profile,

42:30.215 --> 42:34.094
FBI gave it to a behavioral specialist
to confirm what we knew.

42:34.177 --> 42:37.305
White, male, truck driver, mid-30s,

42:37.389 --> 42:39.307
but nothing groundbreaking.

42:39.391 --> 42:42.394
Some people, they just think that...

42:42.477 --> 42:47.733
the girls, the hookers and the druggies,
they got what they had coming.

42:47.816 --> 42:49.067
What do you believe?

42:50.193 --> 42:54.156
Hard luck in life don't make you
any less of a human.

42:54.239 --> 42:57.826
Everybody needs a chance
to get back on their feet.

42:59.453 --> 43:02.622
Few days ago, a body was discovered
up by the state line.

43:02.706 --> 43:06.501
Same M.O. to a T. And then
last night at the motel,

43:06.585 --> 43:10.464
it was still him,
but it was just rushed, improvised.

43:10.547 --> 43:13.258
- Why the break in routine?
- Honestly...

43:14.968 --> 43:17.846
I kinda think he was looking for you.

43:17.929 --> 43:21.224
But my question is... why?

43:22.225 --> 43:25.061
I started communicating a few weeks ago
through an online ad.

43:25.145 --> 43:28.273
<i>Decided to meet up
at a motel in Loxley.</i>

43:28.356 --> 43:32.277
Some locals jumped prematurely,
started making arrests.

43:32.360 --> 43:36.406
I didn't blow my cover.
After a little more... e-flirting,

43:36.490 --> 43:38.909
we decided to meet up
at the Oasis a few nights ago,

43:38.992 --> 43:41.119
and some low-level pimp
spooked him off.

43:41.203 --> 43:44.498
Stayed on me, though.

43:44.581 --> 43:46.708
<i>We were supposed to meet
at the Mustang last night.</i>

43:46.792 --> 43:50.295
- <i>He'll be long gone by now.</i>
- <i>I can set him up again.</i>

43:50.378 --> 43:53.507
It's too dangerous.
That'll never get authorization.

43:53.590 --> 43:55.634
You just said that you think
he's looking for me.

43:55.717 --> 43:57.177
He's gonna wanna try again.

43:58.845 --> 44:02.349
Do you think that girl that disappeared
from the Oasis is still alive?

44:02.432 --> 44:05.060
I don't know. Maybe.

44:05.143 --> 44:07.938
<i>Okay then,
who reported her missing?</i>

44:08.021 --> 44:10.690
<i>I got a call from her sister,
Heather Wallace.</i>

44:13.151 --> 44:14.653
- Heather?
- Hmm.

44:14.736 --> 44:16.655
I'm the one that called.

44:23.578 --> 44:25.580
Are you a cop?

44:25.664 --> 44:27.123
Just here to help.

44:27.207 --> 44:29.000
- You brought her here?
- I didn't have a choice.

44:29.084 --> 44:33.004
I borrowed some money
from people that I thought was my friends.

44:33.088 --> 44:35.632
And boom, next thing you know, I'm here.

44:35.715 --> 44:38.927
And I was told I had
to pay it off. You know?

44:39.010 --> 44:40.887
It's not totally bad all the time,

44:40.971 --> 44:43.723
but it's not for no 16-year-old.

44:43.807 --> 44:46.643
That's what I told him.
Said she's off limits.

44:48.311 --> 44:49.855
That shit didn't last long.

44:57.487 --> 45:00.782
- Who?
- The skinny fuck who runs this place.

45:00.866 --> 45:02.117
Calvin.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.452
Thursday the last night
that you saw your sister?

45:04.536 --> 45:08.748
Yeah. Calvin got his girls
fucked up on something nasty

45:08.832 --> 45:10.917
<i>and had all these guys come over.</i>

45:11.001 --> 45:12.669
<i>Said it was a group thing.</i>

45:12.752 --> 45:15.380
<i>All I remember is telling Tracey
to get the fuck out of here.</i>

45:15.463 --> 45:17.048
<i>Tracey, get out of here.</i>

45:17.132 --> 45:20.594
<i>So she left, and never come back.</i>

45:20.677 --> 45:22.387
Where does Calvin stay?

45:22.470 --> 45:25.223
The room at the far end.
Since the accident.

45:25.307 --> 45:28.226
Got busted up in a car crash.
It's kind of funny.

45:28.310 --> 45:29.603
Ha.

45:30.812 --> 45:32.439
Will you find her for me?

45:32.522 --> 45:34.733
Yeah, I'm just gonna go
have a chat with Calvin.

45:46.286 --> 45:49.623
You said...
that if I'm quiet,

45:49.706 --> 45:52.918
and if I'm good, that you'd let me go.

45:53.001 --> 45:55.921
You've been a good girl.

46:02.135 --> 46:03.887
Yeah, you been a good girl now.

46:07.432 --> 46:09.267
Oh, sweetheart.

46:11.061 --> 46:12.771
You got nowhere to go.

46:15.273 --> 46:16.942
Better off here with me.

46:26.368 --> 46:28.119
How can you do this?

46:32.999 --> 46:35.085
You have a daughter.

46:35.168 --> 46:37.003
I know you do!

46:37.087 --> 46:40.048
- I heard her voice!
- Hey!

46:41.424 --> 46:43.385
Don't you talk about my daughter!

46:49.224 --> 46:52.227
I know, I know.

46:52.310 --> 46:56.106
Don't talk about my daughter.

46:56.189 --> 47:00.986
She was sent to this earth
to absolve me of my sins

47:01.069 --> 47:06.700
and bless me with a greater understanding
of eternal, holy love.

47:12.247 --> 47:14.416
Let it out.

47:14.499 --> 47:18.211
I know. I know.

47:18.294 --> 47:21.172
Just let it out, let it out.
It's all right.

47:21.256 --> 47:25.301
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

47:25.385 --> 47:27.554
Mm-hmm.

47:39.315 --> 47:40.316
That's right.

47:46.740 --> 47:49.075
I would never do this to my daughter.

48:10.221 --> 48:13.516
What?

48:13.600 --> 48:16.311
Um, Stacy, she told me to come see you,

48:16.394 --> 48:18.480
like, about a job or something.

48:20.231 --> 48:21.775
Who the fuck is Stacy?

48:21.858 --> 48:23.151
You gotta be

48:23.234 --> 48:25.612
the stupidest motherfucker
in all of Pensacola.

48:25.695 --> 48:27.072
I thought you'd be long gone by now.

48:27.155 --> 48:28.698
What the fuck, lady?

48:28.782 --> 48:30.784
I'm only gonna ask you this
one fucking time.

48:30.867 --> 48:33.995
- Who did you send away Thursday night?
- What?

48:34.079 --> 48:35.580
You said you sent my date packing
Thursday.

48:35.663 --> 48:38.708
- Who was he?
- Fuck if I know! I was high, man!

48:39.918 --> 48:42.837
How many girls' lives
can I save right now?

48:42.921 --> 48:45.173
All right, he was a truck driver
who's been around a couple times.

48:45.256 --> 48:46.257
That's all I know.

48:46.341 --> 48:47.467
All right, I went up to him,

48:47.550 --> 48:49.636
asked him what the fuck was up
and he pulled off quick.

48:49.719 --> 48:52.472
Big Dallas told me
he had some new girl in 106,

48:52.555 --> 48:53.848
so I went up to see who it was.

48:53.932 --> 48:55.767
- And you know what the fuck happened.
- What does he look like?

48:55.850 --> 48:59.062
- A white truck driver!
- Who does he drive for?

48:59.145 --> 49:00.855
- How the fuck should I know?
- Fucking think, you twink!

49:00.939 --> 49:02.941
Okay, I had someone point him out.

49:03.024 --> 49:04.651
He tried to cuff one of my girls.

49:05.944 --> 49:07.070
That's it.

49:08.071 --> 49:11.157
Lightning bolt.
He had a lightning bolt on his truck.

49:11.241 --> 49:12.367
It's a pickup.

49:12.450 --> 49:14.786
If you're not gone in three days,
I'm gonna kill you.

49:14.869 --> 49:17.372
My daddy never beat my mom, all right?

49:19.833 --> 49:21.459
What?

49:21.543 --> 49:25.171
You said I used to watch my daddy
throw my mom around the trailer and shit.

49:26.756 --> 49:29.425
Only thing I ever saw my dad do
was put a 12-gauge to his head

49:29.509 --> 49:33.263
and blow his brains out
in the bathtub. I was eight.

49:33.346 --> 49:37.934
My mom sat in the station wagon
in our garage until the gas ran out.

49:40.353 --> 49:43.898
We all got excuses, Calvin.

49:43.982 --> 49:45.024
Three days.

49:51.364 --> 49:52.365
Fuck!

50:01.958 --> 50:05.545
Man. So is this the nicest place
you could find for a going-away meal?

50:05.628 --> 50:07.255
- There you go. How about you?
- Thank you.

50:07.338 --> 50:08.590
I'm good, thank you.

50:11.009 --> 50:12.802
Looks like you're feeling better.

50:13.887 --> 50:16.055
Not as good as you.

50:16.139 --> 50:17.932
You look like a giddy fucking schoolgirl.

50:20.393 --> 50:22.770
Last couple of days have stirred up
some shit for me, though,

50:22.854 --> 50:24.022
I'll be honest.

50:25.106 --> 50:27.358
When, um...

50:27.442 --> 50:29.986
When I was a freshman,

50:30.069 --> 50:32.572
I got myself into a bad situation.

50:32.655 --> 50:35.491
And I'll spare you all the gory details,

50:35.575 --> 50:38.786
but basically it involved
an upperclassman,

50:38.870 --> 50:42.749
too much booze,
and some internal bleeding.

50:44.167 --> 50:46.294
My best friend got worried
and she told her mom,

50:46.377 --> 50:50.465
and her mom told my dad
and then it became a family issue.

50:50.548 --> 50:53.134
- He was a cop, right?
- Mm-hmm.

50:53.218 --> 50:55.595
He went after that kid
and his whole family.

50:55.678 --> 50:57.347
He lost his job.

50:58.723 --> 51:01.351
And, uh... that's when my parents
got divorced.

51:02.685 --> 51:03.811
I had no idea.

51:03.895 --> 51:06.272
Well, maybe if you ask somebody
about their life every once in a while,

51:06.356 --> 51:08.858
you'd know that shit.

51:08.942 --> 51:11.069
Fair enough.

51:11.152 --> 51:14.822
He and I actually started taking
taekwondo classes together after school.

51:16.866 --> 51:19.118
Winning tournaments gave me something
to talk to him about,

51:19.202 --> 51:20.578
something to share and...

51:22.538 --> 51:25.708
It, uh, gave me a way to make him happy.

51:31.089 --> 51:34.133
- I think you should leave too.
- We are leaving.

51:36.552 --> 51:38.221
Leave the operation.

51:40.556 --> 51:43.434
Get reassigned. Let me help you.

51:43.518 --> 51:45.770
I know this shit bothers you.

51:45.853 --> 51:49.107
Oh, you do? You listened to my sad story
for two fucking minutes

51:49.190 --> 51:51.359
and all of a sudden you think you should
tell me what I should be doing?

51:51.442 --> 51:53.486
Fuck that. I like doing this shit.

51:53.569 --> 51:56.239
I like having the opportunity
to blast these motherfuckers,

51:56.322 --> 51:57.782
I know why you're fucking leaving.

51:58.950 --> 52:00.201
What the fuck are you talking about?

52:00.285 --> 52:03.413
You're leaving because you're weak,
but don't project that shit onto me.

52:06.124 --> 52:07.292
You wanna know the truth?

52:10.920 --> 52:12.672
You're fucking toxic.

52:12.755 --> 52:16.134
If I stay, you're gonna get me killed.

52:18.136 --> 52:19.637
Good luck in Seattle.

52:43.786 --> 52:45.705
These are gonna work like shit in there.

52:45.788 --> 52:49.959
Yeah, he told me he's gonna be wearing
a plaid shirt and some jeans.

52:50.043 --> 52:51.586
I'm supposed to meet him
at the bar at ten.

52:54.422 --> 52:55.757
<i>I don't like this.</i>

52:55.840 --> 52:57.925
This is an uncontrollable environment.

52:58.009 --> 52:59.510
Yeah, but we don't need control.

52:59.594 --> 53:02.138
All we need is, you know,
a fingerprint on a beer bottle

53:02.221 --> 53:03.556
or a cigarette butt, a strand of hair.

53:08.770 --> 53:11.814
The Handlebar is one
of the wildest spots in the Panhandle.

53:11.898 --> 53:15.318
Okay. Just don't blow your cover
if some guy grabs my ass.

53:15.401 --> 53:17.028
Oh.

53:48.142 --> 53:50.395
I'm in position. No sign at the bar.

54:03.533 --> 54:06.744
This is one fucked-up shithole.

54:09.080 --> 54:11.040
Hey, baby. You want a free mustache ride?

54:11.124 --> 54:12.250
Are you good?

54:14.627 --> 54:17.588
You took the wind out
of that motherfucker right there.

54:17.672 --> 54:19.006
<i>I told you to behave.</i>

54:19.090 --> 54:21.008
This is on me.

54:21.092 --> 54:23.052
We're always looking for a new bouncer.

54:48.411 --> 54:50.746
I think I got a possible hit.

54:50.830 --> 54:52.832
<i>That guy wearing flannel,</i>

54:52.915 --> 54:55.960
<i>he is right across the bar from you.</i>

54:59.380 --> 55:02.008
<i>Ah, shit, I think he made me.</i>

55:02.091 --> 55:04.260
I'm gonna go after him. All right.

55:04.343 --> 55:06.262
<i>All right, he's moving.
Hold your position.</i>

55:08.598 --> 55:10.600
Hey! Hey, wait up!

55:12.560 --> 55:14.520
Hey, wait up! I wanna
talk to you for a sec!

55:22.570 --> 55:24.405
Can I get a beer, please?

55:25.907 --> 55:27.158
Thank you.

55:31.746 --> 55:34.874
- Last one for you, buddy.
- Whoo!

55:34.957 --> 55:38.169
Yeah!

55:39.337 --> 55:41.756
Best live music in North County,

55:41.839 --> 55:43.466
but the patrons leave a lot to be desired.

55:46.177 --> 55:47.595
I said wait up! I want to talk to you!

55:47.678 --> 55:49.680
Bro, what the fuck is this?

55:51.724 --> 55:53.309
State police! Don't move!

55:58.439 --> 56:01.567
You sure do look familiar.

56:01.651 --> 56:02.902
Have we met?

56:05.238 --> 56:07.240
I'm just passing through.

56:08.282 --> 56:11.118
All right. You sure?

56:11.202 --> 56:14.830
'Cause I'd never forget
such a pretty face. Cheers.

56:18.084 --> 56:19.961
I didn't do nothing, man!
Why you chasing me?

56:20.044 --> 56:22.296
- Why you running?
- It ain't mine, man!

56:22.380 --> 56:23.548
Just holding for my cousin!

56:23.631 --> 56:26.217
- Just a drop, man!
- What?

56:36.852 --> 56:38.604
Get the hell out of here, all right?

56:40.982 --> 56:43.317
Suspect not the target!
Cover could be blown!

56:43.401 --> 56:45.653
Repeat, cover could be blown!
Lombardo!

56:49.156 --> 56:50.908
Now...

56:50.992 --> 56:54.745
They got this funny
little motel down in Loxley.

56:56.872 --> 56:58.499
Off the I-10.

57:00.543 --> 57:02.753
Called the Loxley Piper Inn.

57:02.837 --> 57:05.673
Quite the eccentric place,
you know what I'm saying?

57:05.756 --> 57:08.801
Excuse me. Where's
your closest bathroom?

57:11.345 --> 57:13.347
Lombardo! Lombardo!

57:16.058 --> 57:19.979
Best bet to avoid
a line right there.

57:24.609 --> 57:26.444
Keep the seat warm for you.

57:27.945 --> 57:29.363
Excuse me! Hey!

57:29.447 --> 57:30.906
Police! Step aside! Excuse me!

57:30.990 --> 57:33.326
Police! Look out, watch it!

57:38.539 --> 57:40.750
Crawford, I made contact with target.

57:40.833 --> 57:43.794
Yo. Asshole, what you think you're doing?

57:43.878 --> 57:45.838
All right, let him in.

57:58.351 --> 57:59.810
Just hang onto my arm.

58:01.854 --> 58:04.774
<i>Lombardo, answer me!
Lombardo, do you copy?</i>

58:25.836 --> 58:26.921
Hey, hey, hey.

58:27.004 --> 58:30.299
Did you see that woman with the long
black jacket, dark brown hair?

58:30.383 --> 58:32.927
- Did you see her?
- Yeah, every five minutes.

58:33.010 --> 58:34.428
Fucking A!

58:36.055 --> 58:37.264
- Yo.
- What?

58:37.348 --> 58:39.350
Actually, I saw her.
She was all fucked up.

58:39.433 --> 58:41.352
She could hardly walk.
She left with some dude.

58:41.435 --> 58:43.813
- With who?
- Her brother? I don't know.

58:43.896 --> 58:46.107
She don't have a fucking brother!

58:46.190 --> 58:47.566
She didn't fucking leave
with her fucking brother!

58:47.650 --> 58:49.360
- Hey!
- You got fucking shit for brains?

58:49.443 --> 58:52.655
Goddamn it! Fuck!

58:59.995 --> 59:02.206
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Lombardo?</i>

59:02.289 --> 59:04.417
<i>This is Lombardo. Sorry I can't get
to the phone right now.</i>

59:04.500 --> 59:05.584
<i>But leave a message.</i>

59:06.752 --> 59:08.504
<i>Byron.</i>

59:08.587 --> 59:10.297
- Oh, hey, honey.
- <i>Baby, are you coming home?</i>

59:10.381 --> 59:12.550
- <i>Our baby's so fussy.</i>
- She's got a fever?

59:12.633 --> 59:14.260
- <i>Yes, I need you.</i>
- All right, well...

59:14.343 --> 59:16.929
I'm working late tonight,
but I'm gonna come by the house.

59:17.012 --> 59:18.180
- All right?
- <i>Why?</i>

59:18.264 --> 59:20.474
I'm gonna see you soon.
I'm gonna pick up a few things.

59:20.558 --> 59:22.727
- <i>Okay.</i>
- All right. I love you.

59:22.810 --> 59:24.645
<i>I love you, Byron.</i>

59:48.836 --> 59:50.963
Look who's awake.

59:51.046 --> 59:53.716
About time.

01:01:25.516 --> 01:01:29.019
I'm not going through
this again, Byron James.

01:01:30.229 --> 01:01:34.233
We agreed that, when I got pregnant,
that this family would come first.

01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:36.527
We agreed that that little girl
would come first.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:42.032
I don't mind being here all day
caring for your sick baby

01:01:42.116 --> 01:01:45.786
because I know that you're gonna walk
through that door every night.

01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:49.123
You gotta promise me
to always walk through that door.

01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:55.129
You gotta promise me that you won't leave
Bella and me alone, baby!

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:58.674
Baby, baby. Hey. I promise, okay?

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:02.094
I promise. I'll be back. Okay?

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:04.555
But you need to trust me right now.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:07.766
And I need to go, I need to do my job.

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.604
I'll be back. All right?

01:02:11.687 --> 01:02:13.564
That's how we do it, me and you.

01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:41.926
Hey, you ever heard of Jesus?

01:02:42.009 --> 01:02:43.719
Enjoy. Take care.

01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:49.350
- Hey, Fred.
- Byron, what brings you out this way?

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:52.853
- Bit of time-sensitive business.
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:52.937 --> 01:02:54.730
What can I do to help?

01:02:54.813 --> 01:02:56.607
I need to see your video
of that altercation

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.068
Thursday night from outside
your overnight lot.

01:02:59.151 --> 01:03:01.195
I gave that to the police
the next morning.

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:03.197
Can't one of them local yokels
help you out?

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.991
I don't need to see
the Mohawk's cameras, Fred.

01:03:06.075 --> 01:03:07.326
I need to see your cameras.

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:10.120
Byron, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:03:10.204 --> 01:03:11.497
I only got one set of cameras here.

01:03:12.498 --> 01:03:14.291
How long we known each other for, Fred?

01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:16.001
Since high school, I reckon.

01:03:16.085 --> 01:03:17.920
And during that time, I've looked
the other way on all types of bullshit

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:20.005
that's come crawling out

01:03:20.089 --> 01:03:23.133
of this godforsaken cesspool
under your watch, Fred.

01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:27.304
And I never said a goddamn thing
or asked for anything in return, okay?

01:03:27.388 --> 01:03:29.223
Now, that's mostly
'cause I never liked you

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:31.183
and this whole operation
makes my skin crawl.

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:36.689
But I'm coming to you now and I am asking
you personally for a favor.

01:03:36.772 --> 01:03:39.817
Now, it's fair to assume I'd owe you one.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:42.945
Mills, can you hold down the gas station?

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:44.363
- <i>Sure, no problem.</i>
- Follow me.

01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:49.410
Okay. Okay, right here.

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:53.372
Okay, this fat guy
gets a little handsy with that hooker.

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:55.749
And then... boom!

01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:57.793
This guy blasts him from behind.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:03:59.878
Wait, stop it there.

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:02.506
- Who's that?
- Hell if I know.

01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:09.138
Where did they go?
Where does he take her?

01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:12.933
I don't know. That's kind
of weird, they just disappear.

01:04:13.017 --> 01:04:16.311
No, no, wait. Wait. Wait.

01:04:16.395 --> 01:04:18.897
Stop it. There.

01:04:18.981 --> 01:04:21.358
That truck, what freight company is that?

01:04:21.442 --> 01:04:24.611
Looks like Southern Harbor.
Yep. That's their flag.

01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:28.115
Whoo! Thank you, Fred!

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.533
All right.

01:04:41.045 --> 01:04:42.880
Ah!

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:54.224
Fuck.

01:05:10.282 --> 01:05:11.450
Shit.

01:05:12.493 --> 01:05:14.411
Fucking pervert.

01:05:32.304 --> 01:05:34.515
- Hello?
- Can I help you?

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:37.434
I'm not sure. My name is Byron Crawford.
I'm with the FDLE.

01:05:37.518 --> 01:05:39.686
I'm trying to locate
a Southern Harbor driver who...

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:42.731
That would be our customer service
department, on the other side of the dock.

01:05:42.815 --> 01:05:44.441
I was just hoping
you'd get logs from last week

01:05:44.525 --> 01:05:46.485
and see who might have passed through
the Mohawk on I-10

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.320
last Thursday evening? I know...

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:50.739
Let me stop you right there, Mr. Crawford.

01:05:50.823 --> 01:05:53.534
I know what you're doing.
So I suggest you get a court order

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:55.160
- and I might be able to help.
- But ma'am...

01:05:55.244 --> 01:05:57.204
I can appreciate the thankless

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.456
and difficult nature of your job,
Mr. Crawford,

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.875
but I will not get stuck
explaining to my boss

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.628
how this information was obtained outside
the letter of the law.

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.505
I completely understand, ma'am.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:09.216
I appreciate you
explaining your predicament.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.844
I appreciate you understanding.

01:06:11.927 --> 01:06:16.056
You know, my predicament
is that seven times in the past 26 months

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:19.184
I've sat down with family members
to deliver them the news

01:06:19.268 --> 01:06:22.396
that their daughters,
granddaughters, nieces,

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:25.691
sisters, wives, and mothers
had been brutally murdered

01:06:25.774 --> 01:06:28.318
and dumped like garbage
along Interstate 10.

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:36.451
And I can't drive out to another family...

01:06:37.995 --> 01:06:39.371
and deliver that news again.

01:06:40.581 --> 01:06:42.457
He hurts women, ma'am.

01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:44.126
He hurts girls.

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.963
And he's hurting someone right now.

01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:56.638
Just give me a minute,
Mr. Crawford, okay?

01:07:05.898 --> 01:07:07.774
Not your fragrance?

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:11.486
That color sure does
look good on you, though.

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:16.200
Well, you're a smart one, huh?

01:07:16.283 --> 01:07:18.035
It's okay.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.706
I kinda like the smart ones.

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:26.752
Shit.

01:07:33.342 --> 01:07:34.968
You like that dress?

01:07:36.595 --> 01:07:38.597
Belonged to a friend of mine...

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.890
<i>a few years ago.</i>

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:44.895
<i>She sold the most beautiful flowers
from this little roadside stand.</i>

01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:47.522
<i>Flowers, sir?</i>

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:50.108
Man.

01:07:54.863 --> 01:07:56.573
She was so pretty.

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:20.555
She made me this little cute bouquet
to give to my wife.

01:08:22.182 --> 01:08:24.393
I kept the dress for myself.

01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:28.188
You can have it.

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:34.361
I want you to have it.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.287
<i>That's all right.</i>

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:45.372
That's all right.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:46.872
Shh...

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.419
Get some sleep.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:53.212
You're gonna need it.

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:58.719
- Shit.
- Hey.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.053
- Any luck?
- No.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.930
Couldn't find one driver that logged on
to that stretch of the I-10

01:09:03.015 --> 01:09:05.017
after 10am last Thursday.

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.060
Are you sure this is everybody
that drove on Thursday?

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:09.229
Yeah.

01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:12.983
I truly appreciate
your willingness to help.

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:16.319
- Have a good night.
- You too.

01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:18.363
Hey, babe.

01:09:18.447 --> 01:09:19.781
- <i>Byron?</i>
- How you doing?

01:09:19.865 --> 01:09:21.742
I need you here, you promised.
Our baby...

01:09:21.825 --> 01:09:23.910
- She still not feeling better, huh?
- <i>No, she's not.</i>

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.703
Urgent care should be open soon.

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.288
- <i>I need you here.</i>
- All right.

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:29.291
- <i>I love you.</i>
- I'll be home soon. I love you.

01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:31.167
<i>Please take care of yourself. All right?</i>

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.678
What if a driver calls in sick?

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.764
- The load just doesn't sit, right?
- Of course not.

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.474
Another driver picks it up
or we have a temp driver.

01:09:45.557 --> 01:09:48.643
- But it would show up on that list?
- Yeah, or they wouldn't get paid.

01:09:48.727 --> 01:09:53.106
You know, but sometimes, supervisors,
if they've previously been drivers before,

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:54.775
they'll step in and run the load.

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:56.068
But they would show up on that log?

01:09:56.151 --> 01:10:00.489
No. Managers are salaried, so they don't
have to submit a timesheet log.

01:10:00.572 --> 01:10:02.699
Well, how do you like that?

01:10:02.783 --> 01:10:03.658
What?

01:10:03.742 --> 01:10:06.370
One of our drivers has been out
on medical leave.

01:10:06.453 --> 01:10:09.664
A temp has run their load for the past
two weeks, but not Thursday.

01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:12.459
- A manager signed for the load.
- Who?

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:18.298
Peter Hillborough.

01:10:30.018 --> 01:10:33.271
Hey, Daddy. Cutting up
some wood before dinner?

01:10:33.355 --> 01:10:34.856
Hey there, buttercup.

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:39.694
- What you doing down here?
- I wanna help with the work.

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:44.491
I appreciate that, honey.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:49.621
But... you know the equipment in the shed
is very, very dangerous.

01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:51.581
- I know, I know.
- All right?

01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:52.958
I just wouldn't want one of those saws

01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:54.584
to cut your little arm off.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.796
All right.

01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:59.256
Come on, let's go.

01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:01.716
- Dinner's gonna be ready soon.
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:06.638 --> 01:11:08.390
Hello?

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:11.017
Is somebody there?

01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:17.190
Tracey?

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.110
Tracey, are you in here?

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:22.320
Fuck.

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:26.032
Tracey, please tell me
that you're in here.

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:32.747
I talked to Heather.

01:11:32.831 --> 01:11:35.000
She misses you so much.

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:39.129
She wants you to come back really bad.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:42.716
Tracey?

01:11:43.717 --> 01:11:46.052
You saw my sister?

01:11:48.847 --> 01:11:49.890
Yes.

01:11:52.851 --> 01:11:56.229
Tracey, baby, are you okay? Are you hurt?

01:11:58.190 --> 01:11:59.483
I don't know.

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:04.196
My hand and...

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:08.575
my stomach hurt so bad.

01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:14.748
He puts a needle in me
every night and I can't move.

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:17.542
Tracey.

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:21.379
I need you to listen
to me very carefully. Okay?

01:12:24.591 --> 01:12:29.304
I need you to do absolutely everything
that you can to get out right now.

01:12:30.889 --> 01:12:32.682
I can't.

01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:34.851
I can't, he locked me in here.

01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:37.604
There has to be a way out.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.773
This is life and death.

01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:42.901
I can't.

01:12:48.782 --> 01:12:50.534
He's gonna kill you tonight.

01:12:52.619 --> 01:12:55.080
Then he's gonna put me
in that fucking thing.

01:12:58.083 --> 01:13:00.043
So I need you to do this.

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:03.004
Okay? I need you to do it for Heather.

01:13:03.088 --> 01:13:05.090
'Cause she loves you.

01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:08.343
I know you're tired.

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:11.471
But you're so strong
and you're gonna do this.

01:13:13.557 --> 01:13:15.225
Because Heather needs you to.

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:18.979
Okay?

01:13:21.648 --> 01:13:22.983
Okay.

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.169
<i>Saturday? Promise?</i>

01:13:43.253 --> 01:13:44.462
<i>I promise.</i>

01:13:44.546 --> 01:13:47.591
Zoo, Willy T's, and the creamery.

01:13:47.674 --> 01:13:50.468
- It's a date.
- It's a date.

01:13:50.552 --> 01:13:51.761
Okay.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:02.272
It's time for you to get some sleep.
And I'm gonna go to work.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:03.481
Mm.

01:14:12.032 --> 01:14:13.533
Ah!

01:14:19.831 --> 01:14:21.416
I love you, Daddy.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.212
I love you too, baby.

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:37.182
Ugh!

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:41.102
Ah!

01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:45.607
- See you in your dreams.
- All right.

01:14:47.275 --> 01:14:49.986
Get out of those clothes.
Put your PJs on for once.

01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:22.727
Ah!

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:49.963
One, two...

01:16:01.266 --> 01:16:03.810
Three, four, five...

01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:11.526
Twelve, 13, 14, 15...

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:21.703
Twenty-three, 24, 25...

01:16:38.595 --> 01:16:40.013
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:43.808
Somebody's outside
running through the field!

01:17:01.034 --> 01:17:03.578
Oh, no. Oh, no...

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:07.916
Fuck!

01:17:33.608 --> 01:17:35.235
Tracey!

01:19:21.549 --> 01:19:22.759
<i>Pensacola police</i>

01:19:22.842 --> 01:19:25.219
<i>are still seeking information
on the disappearance...</i>

01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:28.681
I know what they're doing here.

01:19:35.021 --> 01:19:37.815
It's gotta be in there...

01:19:40.944 --> 01:19:42.236
Hello?

01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:46.157
Hello?

01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:53.915
Oh, for the love of God!

01:19:57.752 --> 01:20:01.422
- Let me help you.
- Help me. Please help me!

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:04.592
Please!

01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:08.972
He has another. Please call the police.

01:20:43.965 --> 01:20:46.092
- Hello?
- Hi, ma'am.

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:48.219
How are you?
My name is Byron Crawford.

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:50.847
I was hoping to have a few words
with Peter Hillborough.

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:54.183
You just missed him. He went to check
on an elderly neighbor.

01:20:54.267 --> 01:20:56.227
Oh.

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.647
But, you know, come on in. Um, he should
be back in just a few minutes.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:02.775
Mrs. Cubber!

01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:04.485
Peter Hillborough.

01:21:04.569 --> 01:21:06.279
No, no!

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:08.031
No!

01:21:08.114 --> 01:21:10.074
Mrs. Cubber!

01:21:10.158 --> 01:21:11.951
No, please!

01:21:12.035 --> 01:21:15.204
No! No! No!

01:21:15.288 --> 01:21:16.247
Peter.

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:19.500
How can I help you?

01:21:19.584 --> 01:21:22.795
I got somebody here
I believe belongs to you.

01:21:27.133 --> 01:21:28.342
Oh, is it Charlie?

01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:30.428
I just found him outside in the road.

01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:32.638
He almost jumped in front of my truck.

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:36.350
Charlie, now you know better than that.

01:21:36.434 --> 01:21:37.935
- Let me bring him in.
- No, no, it's okay.

01:21:38.019 --> 01:21:40.188
- You don't have to do that.
- I think he might've hurt a leg.

01:21:40.271 --> 01:21:43.983
- You don't have to do that.
- Best if I set him down, have a look.

01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:50.573
Well, looks like he's just fine after all.

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:53.951
- Thank you, thank you for...
- Folks know you live alone.

01:21:54.035 --> 01:21:56.746
I just want to keep an eye out for you.

01:21:59.332 --> 01:22:01.834
It'd make my wife feel a lot better
if I had a look around.

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:04.837
Well, why don't...

01:22:06.297 --> 01:22:08.841
Why don't you come tomorrow?

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:15.306
I will.

01:22:20.103 --> 01:22:22.063
Peter, please.

01:22:25.358 --> 01:22:27.902
Suit yourself, Mrs. Cubber.

01:22:48.422 --> 01:22:52.301
Wouldn't want Charlie to get to chewing
on this beautiful stitching.

01:22:58.975 --> 01:23:00.351
Look, please.

01:23:04.856 --> 01:23:08.192
Look, I really gotta ask you, please...

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:18.327
Look, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave. Now.

01:23:18.411 --> 01:23:20.121
All right, Mrs. Cubber.

01:23:21.122 --> 01:23:24.876
Yeah. You go ahead and have yourself
a good night, Mrs. Cubber.

01:23:29.088 --> 01:23:30.840
We'll keep you in our prayers.

01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:39.223
Are you sure I can't
get you something to drink?

01:23:39.307 --> 01:23:41.434
Oh, no, ma'am. I'm all set.

01:23:43.102 --> 01:23:45.104
Y'all... y'all lived around here long?

01:23:45.188 --> 01:23:47.565
We moved out here about five years ago.

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:49.984
How far away is the neighbor's place?

01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:52.361
- Um, about half mile. Mm.
- Half a mile.

01:23:55.198 --> 01:23:57.200
Wake the fuck up!

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:01.370
Where the fuck'd she go?

01:24:01.454 --> 01:24:03.331
Huh?

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:06.751
You hear me, bitch?

01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:11.422
Where the fuck is she?

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:13.799
Tell me.

01:24:13.883 --> 01:24:15.009
Tell me!

01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:17.011
Huh?

01:24:23.142 --> 01:24:25.311
You know where she is, don't you?

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.730
Don't you?

01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:30.983
Don't you!

01:24:31.067 --> 01:24:33.903
I... I don't know.

01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:38.115
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

01:24:38.199 --> 01:24:40.952
Fuck!

01:24:41.035 --> 01:24:42.119
Fucking bitch.

01:24:44.914 --> 01:24:46.958
Where the fuck is she?

01:24:48.751 --> 01:24:51.087
Well, I should be going.

01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:52.880
Are you sure? He should
be back at any moment.

01:24:52.964 --> 01:24:56.425
He came for the person in the grass.

01:24:56.509 --> 01:24:59.303
You won't tell me, huh?

01:24:59.387 --> 01:25:01.639
Well...

01:25:21.075 --> 01:25:21.993
Oh.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.203
Fuck!

01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:32.086
Fuck!

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:36.132
Oh, yes, you're gonna tell me.

01:25:36.215 --> 01:25:38.759
Tell me where the fuck she is.

01:25:41.971 --> 01:25:44.223
I'm gonna fucking tear you apart.

01:25:45.683 --> 01:25:47.727
I'm gonna fucking tear you apart!

01:25:49.145 --> 01:25:50.229
Lombardo!

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:01.782
Oh...

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:09.415
Well, you sure are something special,
though, aren't you?

01:26:11.584 --> 01:26:12.835
Fuck.

01:26:24.013 --> 01:26:27.099
I guess I'm gonna have
to take care of some business.

01:26:31.145 --> 01:26:32.855
Don't you worry.

01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:34.732
We'll have our time together.

01:26:47.203 --> 01:26:50.539
We'll have a little party.
Just you and me.

01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:53.334
How's that sound?

01:26:53.417 --> 01:26:54.627
Hmm?

01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:08.766
Don't worry.

01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:10.684
I ain't gonna hurt you.

01:27:19.527 --> 01:27:21.237
I won't hurt you.

01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:24.615
I just need you to get some sleep.

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:37.211
It's gonna be all right.

01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:39.130
Just relax now.

01:27:40.965 --> 01:27:42.425
It'll be dark soon.

01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:46.095
It'll be dark soon. Shh...

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:49.348
I need you to be extra quiet
for me, all right?

01:27:50.975 --> 01:27:52.351
Hm.

01:27:58.315 --> 01:27:59.608
Shh.

01:28:10.119 --> 01:28:11.829
Go to sleep.

01:28:13.831 --> 01:28:14.748
Shh...

01:28:31.599 --> 01:28:33.642
Ah!

01:30:13.867 --> 01:30:16.161
I can't leave you alone for one day.

01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:22.918
The doctor said that your throat
has to heal before you can talk.

01:30:23.002 --> 01:30:24.837
Lucky for them, huh?

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:29.675
You are the toughest son
of a bitch I've ever known.

01:32:11.850 --> 01:32:16.850
