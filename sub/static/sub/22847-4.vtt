00:01.043 --> 00:03.504
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.090
I need to cauterise his wound.

00:14.765 --> 00:15.766
It's a transmission.

00:15.891 --> 00:17.268
It's coming from the surface of the Earth.

00:17.435 --> 00:18.519
So, there's someone out there.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.770
<i>We need to find them.</i>

00:19.937 --> 00:21.731
Well, you have carved out a little life

00:21.856 --> 00:23.983
for yourself on this grim little rock,
haven't you?

00:24.442 --> 00:25.484
No, Abby, you can't!

00:25.860 --> 00:27.611
- You sold her.
- Silence.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.574
This is what I do.

00:31.782 --> 00:34.285
My friend's life is on the line,
so I'll figure something out.

00:36.662 --> 00:39.540
- You were right.
- I told you she'd find her way down here.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.387
I rescued humanity.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.390
Did you know that?

00:58.309 --> 01:01.979
What you may not know is how much
I've sacrificed to do it.

01:04.940 --> 01:08.819
Before I arrived, this place was nothing
but a wreckage...

01:10.029 --> 01:11.822
the rotted shell of a dead organism.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.616
But I saw it for what it could be.

01:14.450 --> 01:17.620
I had vision. And now, thanks to you...

01:18.704 --> 01:20.748
that vision has finally come to fruition.

01:22.625 --> 01:23.876
You've taken my blood,

01:24.794 --> 01:26.170
what more do you need from me?

01:32.259 --> 01:34.095
Despite all I did for these humans,

01:35.179 --> 01:38.307
I found them clinging to their gods,
their fairy tales...

01:39.433 --> 01:42.228
one of which was... Quake.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.565
The old ones, rest their souls...

01:47.441 --> 01:50.820
they used to tell the story
of how S.H.I.E.L.D. would return one day

01:50.945 --> 01:52.446
from the past to save them.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.533
- Now here you are.
- Not my choice.

01:57.993 --> 02:00.955
Yet you show up at the exact same time
as another human,

02:01.288 --> 02:05.042
with no marks on her wrist
and a skill set beyond her station.

02:07.962 --> 02:08.963
Jemma.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.967
I know you're trying to say something
but I'm just not sure what.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.055
Perhaps you are more than a fairy tale.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.516
How many of you are here?

02:21.475 --> 02:22.393
No one else.

02:23.227 --> 02:26.021
I want to believe you, Daisy.
May I call you Daisy?

02:26.313 --> 02:29.024
It's a lot less formal
than Destroyer of Worlds.

02:30.276 --> 02:34.405
You see, I have my own interpretation
of the fairy tale.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.160
I think you're here to help me.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.746
- That seems unlikely.
- Does it?

02:45.708 --> 02:48.210
Word of your presence has piqued
much interest.

02:48.919 --> 02:50.588
In fact, bidders are on their way.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.424
And with the price I'll fetch for you...

02:55.134 --> 02:59.180
I'll finally have the means to leave
this horrendous place once and for all.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.765
What makes you think I'd go along
with that?

03:03.684 --> 03:05.227
Because, of course...

03:06.729 --> 03:08.898
your friend's face is so beautiful.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.285
Don't you want to make sure it stays
that way?

03:41.680 --> 03:44.016
- What are you doing here?
- They shut down all the Trawler flights.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.142
No idea why.

03:45.309 --> 03:48.103
So now they even have the pilots working
as crushers, I guess.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.023
That's a little slang I picked up here.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.151
- Crusher, it's when you...
- Phil. I get crusher.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.656
- Anything on Daisy?
- Nothing.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.574
Just when we have a chance
of getting answers on the surface,

04:00.699 --> 04:01.825
two of our people go missing.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.161
Hey.

04:05.996 --> 04:06.830
Anything?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.540
Been checking the guys
working the docking bays

04:08.666 --> 04:11.502
to see if maybe Daisy hopped
a ship to move between Levels,

04:11.669 --> 04:13.003
but I don't know.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.838
I assume she didn't.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.798
Is it time to panic yet?

04:17.173 --> 04:18.175
Possibly.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.886
I've covered every square inch
of this floor.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.346
No sign of Daisy.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.307
I don't like this.
She could be captured...

04:27.643 --> 04:30.187
You're not here to stand around
and gossip.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.439
We were all talking. Why me?

04:33.023 --> 04:34.066
'Cause you're bigger.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.234
Makes it funnier.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.070
Keep working!

04:38.862 --> 04:40.823
Big man downstairs is entertaining.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.117
An intergalactic auction means...

04:43.325 --> 04:48.205
that we have to provide more iron
for Kasius to sell off.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.333
So, we are working triple shifts.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.423
Hey, I answer to the fat cat Blues,
same as you.

04:57.756 --> 05:01.719
Only I have to go and explain to them
why we are not meeting our quotas.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.680
So, make sure we do by the end of today.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.224
Except you.

05:08.934 --> 05:09.935
You're with me.

05:21.155 --> 05:24.116
Guy's name is Gunner. Thinks he's
a tough guy.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.870
Owes me a lot of tokens.
I need you to rough him up.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.123
Oh... you need me to do what?

05:32.124 --> 05:33.125
Beat his ass.

05:33.876 --> 05:37.338
Look, I got it on good authority
that Gunner is waiting on a package

05:37.588 --> 05:38.922
from level 35...

05:39.590 --> 05:43.052
now, that is a high-security,
Kreepers-only technology floor.

05:43.469 --> 05:47.264
He's in debt to me and getting tech
from the Blues? I don't like that.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.516
But you already got enforcers.
Why do you need me to do it?

05:49.933 --> 05:54.104
Well, I had Zev, he was a snake.
Now he's roach food.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.732
Have you looked in a mirror?

05:57.858 --> 05:58.859
You're a beast.

05:59.610 --> 06:00.611
Go be one.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.244
Excuse me.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.665
They grow it.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.500
Uh... What?

06:57.334 --> 06:58.544
You're wondering
where the meat comes from.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.504
There's some kind of lab
where they grow it or something.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.091
Was that just a lucky guess
or did you just...

07:05.592 --> 07:06.635
read my thoughts?

07:07.761 --> 07:08.762
I heard them, really.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.056
That's what I got after Terrigenesis.

07:12.641 --> 07:15.477
You're Inhuman.
That's how you anticipated the moves,

07:16.311 --> 07:19.356
which is not cool, by the way,
reading people's minds without permission.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.066
I hear what I hear.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.987
Believe me, it's kind of a relief
when they turn it off.

07:28.699 --> 07:31.869
- And there we go.
- All right. Everyone out.

07:35.497 --> 07:36.540
Not you.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.501
No, you're something special.

07:40.711 --> 07:41.837
You get a private viewing.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.431
Yeah, I don't think you have a choice,
Mack,

07:52.806 --> 07:54.391
if we want to keep Grill off our backs.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.229
- So, we gotta go rough up this guy Gunner.
- Yeah.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.523
Makes as much sense as anything else
in this place.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.193
Maybe you and Yo-Yo can just talk to him,
avoid the all-out assault.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.360
Both of us?

08:05.611 --> 08:08.113
I'm already missing two agents.
I'm going with Mack's philosophy

08:08.238 --> 08:10.407
- that we stick together here.
- Finally.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.326
As long as you're back before Grill,
we should be fine.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.869
And it gets us an opportunity.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.829
- Yeah. That's you and me.
- Yup.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.540
Grill just tipped us off to Level 35,
Kree technology?

08:18.665 --> 08:21.210
- We have to check that out.
- We have no weapons, no intel.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.921
Well, I'm hoping Level 35 gets us an edge,

08:24.046 --> 08:26.089
or at least something
that'll help us survive on the surface

08:26.256 --> 08:27.966
till we can find Virgil's radio pal.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.719
- You got access to a secure floor?
- No, but...

08:32.429 --> 08:33.429
I think I know a guy.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.101
So, you're making them fight?
Inhumans?

08:38.644 --> 08:41.104
That's what this place is for,
fighting for entertainment?

08:41.730 --> 08:43.106
Not just for entertainment.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.275
For profit.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.444
Kasius's profit.

08:49.655 --> 08:50.656
What does he want?

08:51.740 --> 08:54.034
A demonstration of your skills.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.623
Maybe I don't feel like performing
on cue today.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.458
Unless you've got peanuts.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.545
Maybe you should get in the mood. Fast.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.213
For your friend.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.427
Okay. Fine.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.276
That wasn't what I meant.

09:34.491 --> 09:38.245
I had no idea that you had
the Destroyer of Worlds in your stable.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.497
Oh, did I forget to mention it?

09:41.331 --> 09:45.502
Word's gotten around and a host of traders
are on their way presently.

09:46.837 --> 09:49.881
Well, perhaps I can make a pre-emptive bid
for her now.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.092
Oh, Basha, that would be lovely.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.428
I can make a far greater offer than any...

09:54.553 --> 09:57.055
Unfortunately, discussion of price
will take place over dinner.

09:57.681 --> 10:00.017
And since you so prefer dining
on your own ship,

10:00.601 --> 10:02.436
I fear that takes you out
of the running...

10:04.229 --> 10:05.606
no?

10:06.189 --> 10:09.443
Ah, well. Safe journey home to your...

10:10.277 --> 10:11.903
what was the colourful phrase you used?

10:13.363 --> 10:14.698
"Grim little rock."

10:25.125 --> 10:26.168
She seems nice.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.754
I suppose you're here for payment.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.465
Well, I did bring you Quake.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.051
So you did.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.181
Here.

10:41.892 --> 10:44.936
- Is that rhodium?
- You have an eye for high-value metals.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.565
This'll be worth more
than all your credits upstairs.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.403
Yes, it will.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.865
I want to thank you for bringing her
to me.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.536
But Sinara is concerned
about the prophecy...

11:02.996 --> 11:05.248
that others from the past
might have come, as well.

11:07.626 --> 11:11.171
- Guess that means you are, too.
- Prophecies are hard to decipher.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.256
Could be two people...

11:14.758 --> 11:15.759
could be 20.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.553
Well, maybe the prophecy wouldn't be such
a mystery

11:18.679 --> 11:20.597
if you didn't kill everyone
that knew anything about it.

11:21.807 --> 11:22.849
Yes.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.353
Life is full of regrets.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.317
Still...

11:35.862 --> 11:36.905
How can I help?

11:37.155 --> 11:39.449
Should you come across
any additional time travellers

11:39.783 --> 11:43.120
or anyone who helped them,
I'd be grateful...

11:44.913 --> 11:45.956
and generous.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.422
Let me see what I can find for you.

12:16.987 --> 12:17.988
Hey.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.533
So, you're telling me you don't see
the whole picture?

12:22.701 --> 12:24.578
I'd fill you in but I feel like
you already know.

12:26.163 --> 12:29.332
- I've read Tye's mind, of course I know.
- The ceremonies.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.711
They are making Inhumans fight each other.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.173
And people bid on them. Are you okay
with this?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.676
- I've come to terms with it.
- And everyone else?

12:40.552 --> 12:41.595
The others don't know.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.055
- They can never know.
- Wait, what?

12:44.347 --> 12:45.766
- They have the right to fight back.
- But we have to.

12:45.891 --> 12:47.267
- You can't just sit here and do nothing.
- You can't tell them. You can't tell

12:47.392 --> 12:48.518
- anyone. If the others find out...
- You've gotta...

12:48.643 --> 12:50.437
...they can't do what has to be done.

12:51.980 --> 12:52.981
We do this,

12:53.440 --> 12:55.442
demonstrate our powers and go
with whomever buys us

12:55.567 --> 12:58.278
because our families get compensated
once we're gone.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.031
You mean they get paid
to sell you.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.533
I mean they have a better shot
at survival.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.495
- Survival is everything.
- This is insane.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.746
This is life.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.378
Otherwise, our families could pay
the price.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.841
You have people you care about,
I heard that much.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.262
If you care about them,
I suggest you play the game.

13:26.389 --> 13:30.060
And if they pit us against each other,
I suggest you try to win.

13:33.730 --> 13:34.773
'Cause I will.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.792
- Hey. Come on.
- Sorry.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.337
- We need to talk.
- Say, "Deke. How you doing?

13:57.546 --> 14:00.924
You look really good. Can we have a word?"
See? It's not that hard.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.425
I was coming to find you guys, anyway,

14:02.551 --> 14:03.760
'cause I haven't seen you
in a little while.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.847
I was hoping Daisy was with you.
Last we heard, she was looking for you.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.850
Yeah, she found me. I was just with her
a couple hours ago.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.770
And it's... it's all good. I...
I helped her onto a lower medical floor.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.190
- It's where we think your other friend is.
- She never came back or checked in.

14:17.983 --> 14:22.028
She said something
about no further contact, spy stuff.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.948
- How'd she put it? "Silent mode"?
- Going dark.

14:25.115 --> 14:29.369
Yeah, that. And I told her
that you'd wonder and she said, quote,

14:30.203 --> 14:33.456
"Get out of my way, this is what I do.
My friend's life is on the line.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.041
I'll figure something out."

14:37.002 --> 14:40.922
- Yeah, that sounds like Daisy.
- Sorry, I don't have her, I wish I did.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.216
It's all right, we came for you.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.052
What do you know about Level 35?

14:46.803 --> 14:48.847
Well, every few floors,
there's a secure Kree Level.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.224
Level four is holding, that's...

14:52.475 --> 14:55.395
where I met you fine folks.
And then Level 17 is engineering.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.522
But I've never seen 35. Why?

14:58.315 --> 15:02.068
We're hoping to find some Kree technology.
Anything that'll help us.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.654
We need to investigate the surface.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.078
The surface. Yeah, why not?

15:12.203 --> 15:14.122
No, yeah. It'll take too long to get
to the centre of the sun.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.498
I know, it's an unconventional plan.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.000
What is actually wrong
with you people

15:17.167 --> 15:19.753
that you keep going places you
are not supposed to be going?

15:19.878 --> 15:22.756
- Are you all very suicidal?
- We have reasons.

15:23.465 --> 15:24.925
- Not good ones.
- We do now.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.510
Virgil's time in the Trawler,

15:28.261 --> 15:29.888
he was communicating with the surface.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.641
<i>Virgil, come in. Do you read?</i>

15:34.184 --> 15:36.561
<i>We haven't heard from you in three days,
please respond, Virgil.</i>

15:37.270 --> 15:38.438
<i>Have you secured the delegation?</i>

15:40.231 --> 15:42.484
Those people are all dead.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.861
- Kasius thinks they're all dead.
- I know.

15:48.239 --> 15:51.534
- I need to go get a few things.
- Oh, so now you're interested?

15:51.701 --> 15:52.744
Those people up there...

15:53.954 --> 15:56.122
if we can find them,
that's in everyone's best interest.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.218
- Is that Gunner?
- That's Gunner.

16:08.885 --> 16:09.886
Try to walk casual.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.722
If you can see me,
that's me walking casual.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.101
That's fair. But try not to do
anything rash.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.355
Do you want to talk about it
or make not very subtle comments all day?

16:20.689 --> 16:21.898
Spit it out, turtle man.

16:23.066 --> 16:26.528
So, we're beating people up now?
It's bad enough what we've already done.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.280
Are you talking
about Grill's right-hand man?

16:30.240 --> 16:33.785
- I did it to save lives, your life.
- Yeah. Now the guy's dead.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.788
And I'm sorry about that
but I choose you over him every time.

16:37.789 --> 16:38.790
Yeah.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.256
I just don't want us
losing ourselves here.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.091
Look what happened to Fitz
in the Framework.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.176
- This is different.
- Yeah, I know it's different.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.303
- This place is real.
- Yeah, exactly.

16:52.429 --> 16:56.266
Real danger, real violence.
We protect ourselves to survive.

16:56.558 --> 16:59.310
- Yeah. Do we have to hurt people to do it?
- If we're being practical, maybe.

16:59.769 --> 17:00.770
Yeah, well...

17:01.563 --> 17:03.523
I was raised do unto others
as you would have them do to you.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.275
Yeah, you were raised in the suburbs.

17:05.525 --> 17:09.779
I didn't grow up in Naperville. I grew up
in Potosí, a city just like this.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.614
- It operates on fear.
- Yeah.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.325
- And you hated it there.
- Yeah, but I learned from it.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.327
We don't have to hurt him to scare him.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.288
Look at that bastard.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.040
He owes money, and he's still trying
to get more.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.126
Maybe he does need a shake-up.

17:24.002 --> 17:28.006
And don't worry, we won't lose ourselves.
I promise.

18:16.679 --> 18:17.680
Jemma...

18:19.015 --> 18:20.016
I'm thirsty.

19:15.905 --> 19:19.701
The truth is not a relative concept,
is it?

19:21.619 --> 19:22.829
A subjective conceit?

19:29.586 --> 19:33.548
Then imagine my disappointment
to discover you and Jemma did,

19:33.673 --> 19:35.258
in fact, hide the truth.

19:36.092 --> 19:39.512
Sinara said, Jemma had a friend
who assisted in saving a life,

19:40.054 --> 19:41.097
seemed to know her.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.267
- Seemed to understand.
- I would ask Simmons,

19:44.434 --> 19:46.686
but she can't hear me
for some twisted reason.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.273
- I already told you.
- Please.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.568
I can't abide untruths.

19:54.694 --> 19:59.365
And it's unnecessary when we can get
to the facts ever so quickly.

20:01.659 --> 20:05.455
Of course, there's no way I can tell
for certain if you're being honest.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.002
But he can.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.433
I already told you. It's just me
and Simmons.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.944
Jemma, who was the woman helping you
when you helped Reese?

20:37.320 --> 20:38.321
I have no idea.

20:39.197 --> 20:42.408
There were lots of people in the exchange
that day. I don't know who they all were.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.208
They're telling the truth.

20:52.627 --> 20:53.628
Both of them.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.566
Did you come through time together...

21:16.693 --> 21:19.404
- or separately?
- I don't understand why that matters.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.614
Because the prophecy spoke
of S.H.I.E.L.D.

21:26.244 --> 21:29.706
And if they did,
you may not even be aware of it.

21:30.164 --> 21:31.207
We came through together.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.168
No one else, just us.

21:34.919 --> 21:35.920
Very well.

21:37.839 --> 21:39.674
Tell us that miraculous story.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.802
Spare no detail.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.187
We were alone.

21:59.235 --> 22:01.487
We lost one, Jeffrey Mace.

22:02.989 --> 22:08.453
Fitz killed him. One of our team members.
Fitz was Jemma's... they were in love.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.542
And he couldn't handle it.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.713
Honestly, none of us really could.
He was gonna leave S.H.I.E.L.D.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.758
So, I took Jemma out to talk alone.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.260
We went to a diner, we were just talking,

22:24.719 --> 22:27.638
when these guys came in
and they grabbed us.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.308
They knocked us out and boom...

22:31.601 --> 22:32.602
we ended up here.

22:38.941 --> 22:42.111
Jemma, now you tell me the same story...

22:43.154 --> 22:45.740
how you two ended up here. And, Jemma...

22:46.741 --> 22:50.453
It had best be a story in perfect accord
with hers.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.841
I was so distraught after our last mission
in the Framework,

23:04.467 --> 23:06.594
when Fitz killed Mace and Fitz was worse.

23:07.929 --> 23:09.347
He decided to leave S.H.I.E.L.D.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.184
It seemed our team was breaking up.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.230
Daisy took me to a diner to talk alone.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.982
To make me feel better, I guess.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.485
And then these men came.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.238
They grabbed us, they knocked us out...

23:27.031 --> 23:28.116
and we ended up here.

23:38.918 --> 23:39.961
Good, then.

23:52.682 --> 23:56.352
I share your concern...
but we have preparations to make.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.354
And remember...

23:59.480 --> 24:01.524
you're not the only one working on this.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.996
I imagine it's not as simple
as taking the elevator down to 35.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.707
No, we can't access it but...

24:18.708 --> 24:21.210
I can get us in below it, find my way in.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.172
I'll call the elevator
from Level 35 itself.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.010
You guys hang tight.

24:40.938 --> 24:43.733
- You trust him?
- You know me better than that.

24:46.569 --> 24:47.820
Welcome to Level 35.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.450
Yeah, well, hold the applause.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.126
Hi.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.296
- What the hell just happened?
- I covered for you.

25:06.047 --> 25:08.508
- Yeah, but how?
- My Inhuman power...

25:09.759 --> 25:11.135
it isn't just reading minds.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.804
You can let other people read your mind,
too.

25:16.224 --> 25:18.142
- So, you told Simmons what I said.
- Yeah.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.478
They don't know I can do that.

25:22.104 --> 25:23.272
What about playing the game?

25:24.815 --> 25:28.611
Daisy, listen, it wasn't just your minds
in there.

25:29.403 --> 25:31.447
That was as close as I've ever been
to Kasius.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.159
My first chance to read his.

25:37.078 --> 25:38.079
Right.

25:38.996 --> 25:39.997
So, what did you see?

25:41.624 --> 25:42.625
Shame.

25:44.085 --> 25:45.127
He hates this place.

25:47.255 --> 25:50.091
When his gala is all done,
Kasius isn't just leaving...

25:51.801 --> 25:54.345
- he wants it all erased.
- He's gonna destroy the station?

25:54.470 --> 25:59.058
Along with everyone on it.
My family. Every family.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.978
But I could also see how powerful
he thinks you are...

26:03.020 --> 26:05.856
- and how powerful you know you are.
- Good.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.694
Maybe it's time we change the rules
on his game.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.830
- Hey.
- Who... What are you...

26:21.080 --> 26:22.832
Grill sent us. He wants his money.

26:22.999 --> 26:26.335
Yeah? Screw Grill. I told him
he'd get his money and he will.

26:26.711 --> 26:28.963
- He thinks you're gonna scare me?
- I should.

26:29.839 --> 26:31.632
Because if I don't, big man here will.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.013
What is this place?

26:38.139 --> 26:39.599
Lab, maybe R&D.

26:40.182 --> 26:42.393
R&D. That works.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.325
Tell Grill to relax.

26:58.159 --> 26:59.744
I'm putting it together. No one wants
any trouble.

26:59.869 --> 27:01.037
Good. Then don't cause any,

27:01.203 --> 27:02.246
'cause I don't know what my friend
will do.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.998
Your friend just needs to calm down.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.877
Take it easy, take it easy.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.171
Now, this package you're waiting for...

27:12.381 --> 27:13.883
you know we can make it disappear.

27:14.717 --> 27:15.718
What did you just say?

27:18.763 --> 27:19.889
If this place is all science

27:19.972 --> 27:21.849
then there's got to be something here
we can use.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.476
We just need to find it.

27:31.567 --> 27:32.568
Roaches?

27:33.653 --> 27:34.654
No.

27:39.033 --> 27:40.284
I'm saying if you try anything,

27:40.576 --> 27:42.870
it wouldn't be hard for us
to go after this package of yours

27:42.995 --> 27:45.581
- and make it so it never gets to you.
- Whoa, whoa. You can't do that.

27:45.915 --> 27:49.210
- Hey, things go missing all the time.
- I swear, I'll kill you.

27:51.796 --> 27:53.422
Wait, what is that?

27:57.927 --> 27:59.512
It's the package meant for Gunner,
isn't it?

28:00.388 --> 28:03.307
Probably. There's been a lot
of vacancies lately.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.226
Must be time to start filling them.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.947
What kind of man makes a threat so low?

28:20.408 --> 28:21.409
You're sick.

28:21.951 --> 28:24.453
Just pay Grill and no one will take
your stuff.

28:25.788 --> 28:27.623
- Mack.
- But if you don't, we'll take that package

28:27.790 --> 28:29.625
- and we'll throw it in the crushing mill.
- Mack, look.

28:40.636 --> 28:41.721
Who threatens a child?

28:44.473 --> 28:48.436
Who would threaten to tear a baby away
from someone when the chance is so rare?

28:50.146 --> 28:53.190
- Sorry, I didn't know. I didn't see.
- Kids are scarce here...

28:54.150 --> 28:57.653
because of people like you
who only understand violence and death!

29:00.489 --> 29:02.241
I hope you never get the privilege.

29:04.535 --> 29:05.911
You'd mess it up, anyway.

29:06.912 --> 29:10.207
People like you don't deserve a child.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.753
Mack! Mack, no!

29:14.128 --> 29:16.338
Mack! Mack, no!

29:16.881 --> 29:18.466
Mack! Mack!

29:20.885 --> 29:22.219
See?

29:37.026 --> 29:38.986
They're using new-borns as a commodity?

29:39.320 --> 29:40.946
How do you think things are done
around here?

29:41.405 --> 29:42.740
It's the only way anyone can have kids.

29:43.991 --> 29:44.992
I'm sorry...

29:45.826 --> 29:47.036
"The only way"?

29:47.328 --> 29:48.704
People don't get pregnant anymore.

29:50.706 --> 29:53.876
Super. And the vibe goes full-dystopian.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.838
What did they do, sterilise
the whole population?

29:58.589 --> 30:01.717
We think they do it through the food
so they can decide who has children.

30:02.593 --> 30:05.137
- How long?
- They've always tried to control it.

30:05.930 --> 30:08.224
I was one of the last ones
that was born the old-fashioned way,

30:08.390 --> 30:10.559
until Kasius decided that it was easiest
to just...

30:10.726 --> 30:12.603
Create the children themselves.
But why?

30:13.437 --> 30:15.147
Are they trying to diversify
the human population?

30:15.272 --> 30:16.482
Kasius doesn't care about humans.

30:16.607 --> 30:18.818
He just wants to increase
the genetic chances they turn.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.737
To Inhumans.
They're much more valuable that way.

30:21.904 --> 30:23.739
Valuable? Valuable to whom?

30:24.448 --> 30:26.283
Deke, what is he auctioning off
down there?

30:26.408 --> 30:27.576
You think he's selling rocks?

30:27.827 --> 30:30.871
The whole process is pretty upsetting,
so we try not to think about the details.

30:31.288 --> 30:32.289
Phil.

30:33.123 --> 30:34.875
- I found something.
- What is it?

30:35.709 --> 30:36.836
Him.

30:38.087 --> 30:39.296
Okay. Ow!

30:40.422 --> 30:41.423
May?

30:41.632 --> 30:44.093
The lab got a new sample
they're supposed to use...

30:45.594 --> 30:46.637
for Inhuman genes.

30:47.596 --> 30:48.597
Daisy.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.226
And they've been holding her
since yesterday...

30:53.269 --> 30:54.687
Is that what that thing says?
Because if you...

30:54.812 --> 30:56.272
You said you were helping her
this morning.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.358
Why would you lie about Daisy
unless you sold her out?

31:00.651 --> 31:02.403
Okay, well, this is probably the part
where I should explain.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.989
No. This is the part
where May breaks your face.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.616
You explaining, kind of secondary.

31:07.992 --> 31:12.079
- Okay, you're mad. I get that.
- Are they using her for breeding?

31:12.204 --> 31:14.498
It seems that way
but that's not why Kasius wanted her.

31:14.623 --> 31:15.791
- So you did sell her out.
- Yes,

31:15.958 --> 31:16.959
but it's mo...

31:19.336 --> 31:22.882
Hey, fellas, we actually... we were
just got a little bit turned around.

31:23.007 --> 31:25.217
Uh... Is this Level 35?
We were actually looking...

31:27.052 --> 31:28.429
Oh, okay, we're fighting.

32:12.932 --> 32:13.933
More Kreepers.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.062
Phil, you take Deke upstairs,
Make him talk. I'll hold them off.

32:18.228 --> 32:19.355
I'm not leaving you here alone.

32:20.064 --> 32:21.398
- Go.
- May, your leg.

32:21.690 --> 32:24.652
- You're still not a 100 percent.
- I got this. Go.

33:41.437 --> 33:42.438
Okay.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.108
The bleeding's stopped, how's it feel?

33:47.192 --> 33:49.069
- It's fine.
- Good. Not too tight?

33:50.029 --> 33:53.532
- No, snug. Not too tight.
- Okay. In that case...

33:55.492 --> 33:58.954
Oh. I really need you people
to stop doing that.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.332
- Where's Daisy?
- Look,

34:02.458 --> 34:03.876
- I had to do that.
- Oh, you had to?

34:04.001 --> 34:05.794
Yeah, I had to. People had died,

34:05.961 --> 34:08.130
and Kasius wouldn't have hesitated
to kill hundreds more,

34:08.297 --> 34:10.716
and Daisy didn't even seem
to care at all.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.551
So, trust me.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.179
- It's safer with her out of the mix.
- I don't trust you.

34:15.304 --> 34:16.764
Well, I did what needed to be done.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.141
Oh, please. That wasn't the first time
you went for a payday.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.310
You weren't out to save lives.
You made a profit.

34:21.476 --> 34:24.438
- The two aren't mutually exclusive.
- So don't pretend your motives were pure.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.440
Oh, please. There's so much
you don't even know.

34:26.774 --> 34:27.983
And now you're doing it again, aren't you?

34:28.567 --> 34:30.110
You don't want to help those people
on the surface.

34:30.319 --> 34:33.362
- You want to turn them over to Kasius...
- You don't know me, man!

34:35.532 --> 34:37.993
I was nine, okay?

34:38.702 --> 34:41.621
When my mother got dragged away
and murdered.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.293
Kasius got rid of all the elders,
all the smart people

34:46.460 --> 34:47.628
and she was one of them.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.547
And after she was gone, my dad took up
the cause.

34:52.216 --> 34:53.300
He carried the torch for her.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.969
And as I got older, I begged him not to.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.473
I said that they were gonna get him, too
and I was right.

35:00.724 --> 35:03.477
He got sent to the Roaches, just like
the rest of them.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.567
That's why it was pretty strange
to hear his voice.

35:12.069 --> 35:13.070
That was your father?

35:14.530 --> 35:17.616
If he's alive up there,
I don't just want you to succeed,

35:18.117 --> 35:19.535
I need to be there when you do.

35:21.328 --> 35:22.996
Oh, that's a good story.

35:24.373 --> 35:29.211
But... stories are what you do,
so excuse me if I don't buy it just yet.

35:29.711 --> 35:32.464
You wanna help us, you're gonna need
to prove it.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.717
- How?
- Let's start with the payment

35:35.884 --> 35:36.885
you got for Daisy.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.013
Someone else needs that more than you do.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.405
That's more painful
than getting stabbed.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.160
That buy me some trust?

36:02.578 --> 36:03.745
It buys you some time.

36:05.914 --> 36:06.915
But for now...

36:08.750 --> 36:10.502
I think we're safer with you out
of the mix.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.422
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

36:14.756 --> 36:15.757
Wait!

36:18.343 --> 36:20.137
Hey! Hey!

36:20.679 --> 36:22.723
- Any word from May?
<i>- Come on! Hey!</i>

36:23.056 --> 36:24.099
No.

36:24.224 --> 36:26.476
<i>Hey!</i>

37:02.387 --> 37:05.224
Wanna be careful standing around.
Grill's gonna be back soon.

37:10.771 --> 37:12.147
Are you ready to talk yet?

37:15.150 --> 37:16.151
There's nothing to say.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.155
I mean, there I was, telling you not
to lose yourself.

37:21.531 --> 37:23.033
Who doesn't love irony, right?

37:23.450 --> 37:27.120
Mack, Gunner hit your weak spots.
Of course, you reacted.

37:28.747 --> 37:29.998
I just couldn't listen to him.

37:30.249 --> 37:32.000
He doesn't know what you've lost,

37:32.584 --> 37:35.420
- or how great of a dad you are.
- But what if I'm not?

37:36.380 --> 37:39.007
- Not what?
- A great dad.

37:39.341 --> 37:42.469
- Mack, please. Stop it.
- No.

37:45.806 --> 37:48.267
When Hope died, the real Hope...

37:49.559 --> 37:53.063
she never came home and still
it took me weeks

37:53.188 --> 37:56.358
before I could walk into her nursery
and take everything away but I did it...

37:58.068 --> 37:59.111
eventually.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.655
It must have been hard.

38:02.864 --> 38:03.865
But this Hope...

38:08.495 --> 38:09.496
my Hope...

38:10.914 --> 38:11.957
in the Framework...

38:18.422 --> 38:19.423
She, uh...

38:23.760 --> 38:24.761
This is harder.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.229
I miss her so much.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.029
It's so much worse.

38:43.405 --> 38:44.406
Imagine that.

38:48.285 --> 38:51.413
I survived the pain of losing
my real child,

38:52.581 --> 38:54.791
but I can't get over the pain of losing
a fake one.

38:56.626 --> 38:58.545
So what kind of a father
does that make me?

39:01.006 --> 39:02.632
Maybe Gunner was right about me.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.721
- Maybe, I really am already lost. I...
- Hey.

39:08.138 --> 39:11.767
Hope might not have been real,
but your love for her was.

39:13.018 --> 39:17.147
And that makes you a great father
and a good man.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.026
We'll get through this place intact...

39:22.277 --> 39:23.278
together.

39:24.905 --> 39:25.906
Okay?

39:27.407 --> 39:29.993
Hey, Monster Mack!

39:32.871 --> 39:34.373
Gunner just paid me off.

39:35.665 --> 39:38.627
Whoa! Seems like you're twice the beast
I thought you were.

39:39.795 --> 39:40.962
Glad to have you, Mack.

39:44.591 --> 39:45.675
You fit right in.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.302
And you've dealt with our newest guest?

40:40.147 --> 40:43.608
Your gracious host Kasius would like
to say a few words of welcome.

40:48.363 --> 40:51.700
It is truly my pleasure to invite you
to this wondrous place,

40:52.409 --> 40:54.244
the last bastion of a species,

40:54.661 --> 40:57.539
a place I've been proud to call home
for so long.

40:58.540 --> 41:02.669
You are the first to arrive
for an exhibition of unbridled powers...

41:03.545 --> 41:05.172
to excite the senses.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.134
All leading up to our main event.

41:12.262 --> 41:15.307
One powerful Inhuman,
long thought gone,

41:15.724 --> 41:18.560
now here to enrich
one lucky patron's life.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.563
Quake...

41:22.856 --> 41:23.940
Destroyer of Worlds.

41:27.319 --> 41:30.363
Someone, maybe someone in this room
right now...

41:31.656 --> 41:32.949
will win this prize.

41:42.918 --> 41:43.919
Her power...

41:45.253 --> 41:46.588
will be your power.

41:48.256 --> 41:49.257
So...

41:53.637 --> 41:56.181
are there any requests as we begin?

42:00.185 --> 42:01.520
<i>Forget your exhibition.</i>

42:09.402 --> 42:10.946
<i>She's the Destroyer of Worlds.</i>

42:20.956 --> 42:22.165
She should fight to the death.
