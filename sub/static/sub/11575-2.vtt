WEBVTT

00:07.633 --> 00:09.589
Can someone remind me
why we paid good money

00:09.844 --> 00:11.755
to fraternize with the bits
we flush down the toilet?

00:12.013 --> 00:13.423
It's art.

00:13.681 --> 00:14.761
Is it?

00:15.433 --> 00:17.014
KENZI: So weird
to be back here.

00:17.268 --> 00:18.804
AUSSIE: Yeah...
Hey, remember that time

00:19.061 --> 00:20.050
we stole soup
from Pukey Jim?

00:20.313 --> 00:22.474
Ugh! I still horf when
| smell cream of mushroom.

00:22.732 --> 00:23.972
If he caught us,
we'd be dead.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.769
Good thing he
only had one leg.

00:26.027 --> 00:27.392
--And drank furniture cleaner.
--Yeah...

00:27.653 --> 00:28.608
Human's aren't pathetic.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.899
--Rawr!
--Ahh!

00:36.037 --> 00:37.197
Loser.

00:38.039 --> 00:39.654
Ah, Vex!

00:39.916 --> 00:44.285
lx-nay on the urder-may!
It's all ake-may elieve-bay!

00:45.338 --> 00:46.293
Man--

00:47.006 --> 00:49.338
| peed my
friggin' costume.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.131
Aussie?

00:59.393 --> 01:00.803
Budd YO!
y, you okay?

01:01.062 --> 01:02.393
Yeah-- Yeah,
it's just stuff's

01:02.647 --> 01:04.012
been going down
in these tunnels.

01:04.273 --> 01:04.853
Peeps going missing.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.813
Hey, that's why
we're here, right?

01:07.318 --> 01:08.148
Ow!

01:08.402 --> 01:09.858
Me and Vex have dealt

01:10.112 --> 01:12.103
with some pretty mean
mofo's in our day, okay?

01:12.365 --> 01:14.572
So, if there's an evil
dill-hole in these parts,

01:14.825 --> 01:17.362
we'll find him and we'll
rip his change purse clean off.

01:17.620 --> 01:18.325
I promise.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.319
Hey, I never
agreed to that.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.912
Be nice.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.540
So, Aussie...

01:28.798 --> 01:30.584
Is that short
for Ozwald--

01:30.841 --> 01:32.172
he said
feigning interest...

01:32.426 --> 01:33.632
No.
Australia, mate.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.547
I wanted to go ever since
I was a kid,

01:35.805 --> 01:36.965
and the name
kind of stuck.

01:37.223 --> 01:38.679
but I've never even
been on a plane.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.548
At least it's
an uplifting story.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.175
Anyone ever
told you you look

01:42.436 --> 01:43.551
like Robert Smith
from the Cure?

01:43.813 --> 01:44.643
Yeah, actually.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.057
Yeah, an old friend
from Wales.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.431
Amazing work they're doing
with prosthetics these days.

01:48.693 --> 01:50.558
Apparently she's
walking again.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.151
I told you
to stay home.

01:52.405 --> 01:56.068
Home? With front row tickets
to the smash-up clam derby?

01:56.325 --> 01:56.950
No thank you.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.737
And I'll just add
clams to the list

01:58.995 --> 02:00.826
with cream
of mushroom, great.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.611
You know...

02:44.665 --> 02:46.405
We really need to start
stocking our fridge

02:46.667 --> 02:48.703
with sports drinks.

02:49.045 --> 02:54.415
Because my Medulla Oblongata
is screaming for hydration --

02:54.675 --> 02:58.384
I can literally feel
my equilibrium--

02:58.637 --> 03:00.889
The geek speak is
working, Doctor.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.803
I must be the only
woman in history that has

03:06.062 --> 03:09.646
to pretend to be a ditz to
repel sexual attraction.

03:09.899 --> 03:10.979
[laughing]
Repel?

03:11.233 --> 03:12.188
ReaHy?

03:18.616 --> 03:20.152
You've got to know
that I'm kidding.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.195
I know that
you're kidding.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.698
[phone ringing]

03:34.048 --> 03:34.582
Ugh...

03:34.840 --> 03:36.296
Trick wants me
to go by the Dal.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.051
--He says it's important.
--Uh huh.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.257
Yeah.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.217
How--
How important?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.766
He loves to exaggerate.

03:55.694 --> 04:00.188
You have all heard
of Bloody Mary...

04:00.449 --> 04:01.609
CROWD: Bloody Mary!

04:01.867 --> 04:05.451
Bloody Mary!
Bloody Mary!

04:06.455 --> 04:09.197
The Slender Man!

04:09.458 --> 04:11.369
CROWD: We must follow!

04:11.627 --> 04:13.083
We must follow!

04:13.337 --> 04:15.544
--[ La ughter]
--We must follow...

04:15.798 --> 04:16.548
[Groaning]

04:16.799 --> 04:18.915
CROWD: We must follow...

04:19.635 --> 04:22.092
But only one is true:

04:22.847 --> 04:25.429
The Sewer Alligator!

04:25.683 --> 04:27.264
Rawr!

04:29.728 --> 04:30.228
Did you see that?

04:30.479 --> 04:34.063
Flushed down the toilet
and out of our world...

04:34.316 --> 04:35.476
unwanted...

04:35.734 --> 04:37.270
cast out!

04:37.611 --> 04:38.987
I did see that.

04:39.947 --> 04:43.280
CROWD: Ooh!

04:45.035 --> 04:46.491
GIRL: Ahhhh!

04:47.329 --> 04:52.414
[Crowd screaming]

04:52.668 --> 04:53.532
It's time to jettison.

04:53.794 --> 04:54.783
Aussie!

04:55.254 --> 04:56.289
Aussie!

04:58.132 --> 04:59.087
Aussie...

05:01.594 --> 05:04.256
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.300
It's harder when you don't
know what you are.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.303
My love carries
a death sentence.

05:10.561 --> 05:14.804
l was lost for years...
searching while hiding.

05:15.691 --> 05:19.183
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.571
I won't hide anymore.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.438
I will live
the life I choose.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.250
Are you okay?

05:45.930 --> 05:46.965
Yeah.

05:47.765 --> 05:50.677
Yeah, I'm fine.
lt'sjust, um...

05:54.271 --> 05:55.886
I'm fine.

06:00.236 --> 06:02.101
Do you know that,
for the last two nights

06:02.363 --> 06:05.275
that I've slept over,
you've woken up screaming?

06:06.450 --> 06:08.862
|s committing
to me that terrifying?

06:09.119 --> 06:11.405
Uh...
of course not.

06:13.499 --> 06:14.488
Go back to sleep.

06:14.750 --> 06:15.910
Mmm...

06:35.396 --> 06:37.011
Bo!
Oh, thank god!

06:37.273 --> 06:38.137
There was
this reptile guy

06:38.399 --> 06:42.187
and he took Aussie,
albino, pee--

06:42.444 --> 06:42.944
Wait. What?

06:43.195 --> 06:44.571
Who peed?
Who's Aussie?

06:44.822 --> 06:46.028
lt's short for Australia.

06:46.282 --> 06:48.318
It was this walking tour,
this Alligator Man,

06:48.576 --> 06:50.407
this Fae, he took him--
he took my friend...

06:50.661 --> 06:52.401
Okay, calm down,
Kenzi.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.995
Vex is this true--
was this Fae?

06:55.249 --> 06:55.999
[Laughing] Well,

06:56.250 --> 06:57.330
if he had been Fae,
his acting

06:57.585 --> 06:59.325
would have been a
damn sight better.

06:59.587 --> 07:00.702
Did you know that
Sir Lawrence Olivier--

07:00.963 --> 07:02.794
No, not the performance,
Brit-pop,

07:03.048 --> 07:03.912
the attack.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.675
Well, it did have
a certain panache.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.041
So, yeah,
probably.

07:07.303 --> 07:08.713
Bo, we have
to go find him. Now.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.757
Yes, Kenzi,
of course.

07:11.015 --> 07:11.470
Let's go, Vex.

07:11.724 --> 07:13.305
Sorry, love,
no can do.

07:13.559 --> 07:16.175
Real Housewives
Marathon begins in five.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.268
Mother, may I kill
the free loader?

07:18.522 --> 07:20.183
He's not worth
the sweat, sweetie.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.181
Enjoy our chips.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.357
Oh, and know this, if you
go near my girlfriend,

07:27.615 --> 07:29.947
the little balls hanging from
our Christmas tree next year

07:30.200 --> 07:32.065
will have
a certain panache.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.952
Hook up illegal cable
and what do | get?

07:35.205 --> 07:36.365
Threats
against my junk.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.239
Typical.

08:04.068 --> 08:06.605
Twenty bucks if you
kill the white-boy.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.449
New baby mama, lce?

08:14.703 --> 08:16.489
Tempting, but no.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.742
If you're Dyson,
I'm your new partner.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.507
[Snarling]

08:33.514 --> 08:35.425
Bet on
the wrong guy again.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.889
Story of my life.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.098
You should get
that looked at.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.266
l'm Tamsin.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.558
Never heard anything
about a new partner.

08:47.820 --> 08:51.278
Yeah, well... don't you
just love surprises?

08:51.532 --> 08:52.692
What's that?

08:52.950 --> 08:55.441
I hate to break up this little
love fest we're having but--

08:55.703 --> 08:57.694
There's a sewer alligator
sighting, so we're up.

08:57.955 --> 08:58.865
Sewer alligator, huh?

08:59.123 --> 09:00.613
Mmhmm.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.122
All right.

09:04.128 --> 09:06.585
Quarantined Fae
under the city.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.375
They can't still be
alive, can they?

09:08.632 --> 09:09.542
Oh, they're there.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.210
And they're causing
all kinds of stanks.

09:11.468 --> 09:14.676
So, we gotta
"take care" of them.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.670
If you catch my drift.

09:16.932 --> 09:18.638
No, that was
a little subtle.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.757
Maybe you could do it
again with sound effects.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.681
You're funny.
Almost.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.140
Says here...

09:28.402 --> 09:30.609
Two Fae City Workers
have also been taken.

09:30.863 --> 09:33.479
And tall, dark and scaly
attacked a human walking tour

09:33.741 --> 09:36.357
outside a heavily
populated arts festival.

09:36.618 --> 09:39.530
Risked outing the Fae...
bad boy.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.405
Well, that cannot
make the Ash happy...

09:42.666 --> 09:43.416
I wouldn't know.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.373
| report
to The Morrigan.

09:46.462 --> 09:47.417
Excuse me?

09:47.671 --> 09:49.377
Yeah.
Didn't you know?

09:49.631 --> 09:51.337
You and l are part
of a little peace project

09:51.592 --> 09:53.207
between
Dark and Light.

09:53.469 --> 09:55.300
You should read
your newsletter.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.336
| just do
the crossword.

09:57.598 --> 10:02.592
Hm... And attack poor,
defenseless humans apparently.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.059
Yeah, well...

10:04.313 --> 10:07.225
lce smacked his wife around
a few weeks ago.

10:07.483 --> 10:08.347
He was gonna go
down for it too

10:08.609 --> 10:11.351
until he "convinced"
her not to testify.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.443
Thought I'd return
the favour.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.858
So, you're a hero too.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.163
How did you know
that storm drain

10:29.421 --> 10:31.002
would take us
down here?

10:31.256 --> 10:33.372
Well, when Dorothy
clicked her ruby red shoes,

10:33.634 --> 10:35.124
she would go
to Kansas...

10:35.385 --> 10:38.798
| on the other hand,
would come here.

10:39.056 --> 10:39.806
What?

10:40.057 --> 10:42.639
After I ran away,
this was my home.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.009
Met some guys on the street,
said they lived

10:45.270 --> 10:47.761
in a tent city on the
abandoned subway line.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.103
Beat sleeping
on a bench.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.473
Kenzi...

10:50.734 --> 10:52.019
This one time,
I got pneumonia...

10:52.277 --> 10:54.188
my fever was so high,
I started to hallucinate,

10:54.446 --> 10:56.027
and | crawled in
some fat guy's tent,

10:56.281 --> 10:57.737
thinking it was
my mama's bed.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.572
And... it wasn't.

10:59.827 --> 11:03.445
I started screaming and
that's how I met Aussie.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.038
He couldn't have been
more than 13, but--

11:07.292 --> 11:08.907
He saved me.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.411
There is still so much
about you that I don't know.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.164
Well, I'm a riddle,
wrapped in an enigma,

11:15.425 --> 11:18.167
shrouded with--
Oh, sookie sookie now.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.680
Well, when l was running
from life to life,

11:20.931 --> 11:23.138
I never had to resort
to living below ground.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.303
Well, for us humans
finding accommodations

11:25.561 --> 11:27.301
isn't as easy as convincing
some poor schlep he's

11:27.563 --> 11:28.427
in love with you
with one touch

11:28.689 --> 11:30.975
of your soft,
Succu-busty hand.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.645
I'm sorry, that--
That came out wrong.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.142
No, no,
| get it.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.520
[Phone ringing]

11:37.781 --> 11:39.362
Oh, crap!

11:41.118 --> 11:42.449
How's my
favorite grampy?

11:42.703 --> 11:45.115
Thinking about
getting blind drunk.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.034
Oh, bartender...

11:49.459 --> 11:51.791
Momma's gone
a little dry again.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.501
Why?
What's wrong?

11:53.755 --> 11:56.337
I took the liberty
of contacting a Weaver

11:56.592 --> 11:58.878
to help you with
your night terrors.

11:59.803 --> 12:00.667
You got me
a Dream Weaver?

12:00.929 --> 12:02.214
Kind of.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.758
Weavers are mystics.

12:05.017 --> 12:09.181
They specialize in finding out
what's haunting a person.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.096
Someone is
ignoring me...

12:12.733 --> 12:16.317
Right now she's specializing
in haunting me.

12:17.154 --> 12:18.564
Drunk old wind bag...

12:18.822 --> 12:19.652
Trick!

12:19.907 --> 12:20.646
TRICK: Sorry.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.866
The last eight hours have
been the hardest of my life.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.401
When will you be here?

12:26.663 --> 12:29.871
Well, the thing is, Trick--
is Kenzi's friend was snatched

12:30.125 --> 12:34.664
and, well, I'm underneath
the city... looking for him.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.670
Of course you are.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.833
Well, perhaps we could
postpone this whole thing.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.005
I'm sure Eunice
has other places to be.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.503
Uh uh...

12:44.806 --> 12:47.969
No. I would love to stay.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.683
Especially if a
handsome barkeep

12:50.938 --> 12:53.520
has a place
for me to...

12:53.774 --> 12:55.685
rest my head...

12:55.943 --> 12:58.525
...and my hands.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.570
[Whispering]
Please hurry.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.485
Oh, man.
He is miserable.

13:04.743 --> 13:05.732
Then why
are you smiling?

13:05.994 --> 13:07.780
Because one night being
chased around his lair

13:08.038 --> 13:09.448
might do him
some good.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.539
Dead end.
Great.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.749
Now what?

13:55.002 --> 13:57.414
At least
he eats organic.

13:57.671 --> 14:00.413
Didn't do much
for his eyesight, though.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.103
What is this place?

14:17.357 --> 14:18.688
I don't know.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.933
[Murmurs]

14:37.085 --> 14:39.371
They're Fae and
they live like animals.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.585
Animals that
took my friend.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.754
Foot.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.214
Foot.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.178
Boot!

15:00.984 --> 15:03.851
Would you believe we took
a wrong turn at Albuquerque?

15:06.990 --> 15:09.948
I do hope you haven't
been treated too poorly.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.406
My brethren possess
a verve when dealing

15:13.663 --> 15:17.622
with trespassers that I fear
can be a touch dramatic.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.582
Look, we are
not trespassers--

15:19.836 --> 15:21.121
Young Lady...

15:21.379 --> 15:24.212
I assume you were
brought up in civilization.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.506
Did you not learn
how pedestrian it is

15:27.761 --> 15:29.342
to interrupt your
host when he is

15:29.596 --> 15:32.508
pontificating on your
unexpected arrival?

15:34.893 --> 15:36.349
You may speak now.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.467
BO: I'm sorry--

15:37.729 --> 15:39.890
You abduct my friend and
you want me to be polite?

15:40.148 --> 15:41.684
No, I want
to be left alone!

15:41.942 --> 15:43.432
Most people that
want to be left alone

15:43.693 --> 15:47.185
don't attack tourists or
chow down on Fae soldiers.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.780
You see, sight
is a funny thing.

15:51.034 --> 15:55.027
One of the five senses,
but not one of our finest.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.665
You live in the dark
as long as l have

15:57.916 --> 15:59.907
and you lose your
reliance on it.

16:00.168 --> 16:04.878
Only then, can you truly
begin to live in the light.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.874
To know what is right.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.875
What is right?

16:10.137 --> 16:13.971
Ripping a man to
shreds is barbaric.

16:14.766 --> 16:15.972
What you saw
in that wheelbarrel

16:16.226 --> 16:18.091
was merely
an oily bit of toast

16:18.353 --> 16:21.390
after a long, dry
wintery season.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.263
A fatted calf...

16:23.525 --> 16:27.234
to mark the end
of a great fasting.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.315
So...

16:29.573 --> 16:30.562
Disgruntled audience
member trying

16:30.824 --> 16:31.734
to rid the
world of nerds,

16:31.992 --> 16:36.782
or Sewer Alligator
annoyed by bad portrayal?

16:37.622 --> 16:39.237
Take a look
at these...

16:41.334 --> 16:43.120
Take a look
at these incisions--

16:43.461 --> 16:46.077
They look like they were
made by teeth, but...

16:47.507 --> 16:48.587
But...

16:50.343 --> 16:53.801
The incisions don't have
an actual bite pattern.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.011
You saying it's
been faked?

16:58.977 --> 17:00.262
[Sniffing]

17:04.399 --> 17:05.730
What is it?

17:07.861 --> 17:09.476
Something familiar.

17:10.739 --> 17:12.695
And... secret.

17:15.118 --> 17:17.734
You know, if I didn't
know better, Dyson...

17:17.996 --> 17:19.987
...|'d swear you didn't
want a new partner.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.739
I can see why they
made you a detective.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.707
You better not be
holding anything back,

17:24.961 --> 17:26.667
because like it or not,
we've been ordered

17:26.922 --> 17:28.833
by the powers on
high to play nice.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.296
Yeah, well,
orders or no orders,

17:30.550 --> 17:31.926
I've been around
long enough to know

17:32.177 --> 17:34.839
I'd be a fool to trust
someone from your team.

17:35.096 --> 17:35.960
My team?

17:36.223 --> 17:38.805
Do you mean
Dark Fae or women?

17:41.686 --> 17:44.018
You touch my friend and
things are going to get

17:44.272 --> 17:45.307
a lot less civilized.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.180
What she means
by less civilized is

17:47.442 --> 17:49.273
that you're cruising
for a gas pedal.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.730
| used to live
above ground, you know.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.156
Didn't have much...

17:56.409 --> 17:57.910
A paid appointment,

17:58.161 --> 18:01.904
showing my unfortunate
visage to Fae nobles...

18:02.165 --> 18:04.702
at dinner parties
and tableau balls.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.414
I did however have
a wife and child.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.247
Unlike me...

18:14.261 --> 18:16.377
...they were magnificent.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.051
I returned home one day
to find them following

18:21.309 --> 18:25.643
a man in black... said we
were being quarantined.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.933
That our poor quality
of life had lead

18:28.191 --> 18:31.058
to an outbreak of a
most deadly disease.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.601
"Help me, daddy."

18:34.322 --> 18:36.233
"Help me, Atticus."

18:37.200 --> 18:39.316
Soon I too was in line,

18:39.577 --> 18:42.068
marching to the music
like a toy soldier.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.413
'Course the disease was
merely a means to an end.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.123
To what end?

18:47.377 --> 18:49.584
Shoving all the poor,
huddled masses down here

18:49.838 --> 18:52.921
was just a bit like sweeping
the dirt under the rug.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.377
No one actually
got sick until after

18:55.635 --> 18:58.092
we were shut
inside this cavern.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.215
I should have
predicted it, though--

19:00.473 --> 19:04.512
My modest home did have
a coveted ocean view.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.853
Been trying to resist
the urge for revenge.

19:09.107 --> 19:11.314
IfI could just remember
what the man looked like--

19:11.568 --> 19:12.978
We just want Aussie.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.316
You took him!
I saw you!

19:14.571 --> 19:16.436
Sight cannot
be trusted, my dear.

19:16.698 --> 19:17.562
Just give him back!

19:19.701 --> 19:20.656
Okay!

19:22.245 --> 19:23.746
BO: We believe you.

19:23.997 --> 19:24.907
We'll leave
you in peace.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.245
Bo! I'm not
going anywhere--

19:26.499 --> 19:27.284
Kenzi...

19:29.169 --> 19:30.659
Peace?

19:32.213 --> 19:34.340
You ladies know your
way to the surface?

19:34.591 --> 19:36.331
No, actually.

19:36.593 --> 19:37.833
It's okay, Kenz--

19:38.094 --> 19:40.210
I was hoping
you'd say that.

19:40.472 --> 19:41.962
KENZI: No, no!

19:44.184 --> 19:45.469
Bo...

19:47.437 --> 19:48.802
Bo?

19:49.481 --> 19:55.226
[Coughing]

20:04.079 --> 20:05.444
VEX: So...
Go on then.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.822
How was it to finally
consummate your marriage?

20:09.459 --> 20:10.494
Ugh...

20:10.752 --> 20:13.118
Oh God, my head...

20:13.713 --> 20:15.214
What--

20:15.465 --> 20:17.581
What happened?
How did we get here?

20:17.842 --> 20:19.343
I don't know,
but if I had to guess,

20:19.594 --> 20:22.051
I'd say years of latent
sexual tension?

20:22.305 --> 20:24.921
Last thing I remember is
being at the cistern chapel,

20:25.183 --> 20:26.798
and then we got
croc blocked.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.049
He gassed us.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.176
The Sewer Alligator.
And then I remember--

20:30.438 --> 20:33.680
Being in the throws
of passion with your bestie?

20:33.942 --> 20:35.227
Are you wearing
my kimono again?

20:35.485 --> 20:38.818
Oh, it's all right.
I had it altered.

20:39.072 --> 20:42.610
Yes, now, it fits
me to perfection.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.370
[Whacking]

20:49.624 --> 20:50.409
Ow!

20:50.667 --> 20:52.157
Not even the likes
of Ebenezer Scrooge

20:52.419 --> 20:55.957
would stoop so low
as to beat a cripple!

20:57.757 --> 20:58.291
Ahem.

20:58.550 --> 20:59.835
Ow!

21:00.468 --> 21:02.459
Sorry, the door was open.

21:06.808 --> 21:07.968
So...

21:08.226 --> 21:10.308
You're the Bo I've
heard so much about.

21:10.562 --> 21:11.768
Yeah.

21:14.566 --> 21:16.056
Who the hell are you?

21:18.027 --> 21:18.891
Thanks for coming in.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.360
Sure.

21:21.239 --> 21:22.570
Why don't you
have a seat?

21:22.824 --> 21:23.939
Thanks.

21:26.828 --> 21:27.908
How have you been?

21:28.663 --> 21:30.028
Good.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.697
...good.
You?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.074
I've been great--
Good.

21:34.335 --> 21:34.960
I'm good.

21:35.211 --> 21:36.872
You know, um...

21:37.130 --> 21:38.495
...good.
As well.

21:39.048 --> 21:42.131
Quite the interrogation
technique, Detective.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.467
Interrogation?
[Laughing]

21:46.973 --> 21:48.133
What is this about?

21:48.391 --> 21:50.097
Look, Bo, last night
we were investigating

21:50.351 --> 21:51.477
the old subway tunnels.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.389
And |...

21:53.646 --> 21:55.728
...smelled your perfume.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.017
Shall we say...

21:58.359 --> 21:59.895
Kenzi's friend, Aussie,
was snatched by

22:00.153 --> 22:01.393
some underground Fae.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.690
We went in
to get him back.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.027
Well, these same Fae
have been taking

22:06.284 --> 22:08.024
other humans
in the open as well.

22:08.286 --> 22:09.446
But, more importantly,
a couple

22:09.704 --> 22:11.990
of Fae city workers
have gone missing.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.113
We've been ordered
to exterminate them.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.751
I don't know anything
about city workers,

22:16.002 --> 22:18.414
but I did see a dead
S.W.A.T. guy down there.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.252
S.W.A.T.?
Are you sure?

22:20.507 --> 22:22.247
Can I ask you
a question?

22:22.509 --> 22:24.045
Sure.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.759
Have you always
been a litter bug?

22:27.013 --> 22:27.638
Excuse me?

22:27.889 --> 22:29.220
Do you always leave
your food around

22:29.474 --> 22:31.840
for other people
to clean up?

22:38.441 --> 22:40.397
Tamsin,
what's this about?

22:40.777 --> 22:41.732
No, I didn't--

22:41.986 --> 22:42.896
Didn't what?

22:43.154 --> 22:45.110
Know feeding off of other
Fae was punishable by death?

22:45.365 --> 22:47.071
No, this looks like
my feed, but I haven't--

22:47.325 --> 22:48.360
Bo--
Stop talking.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.698
Did you know
he was Dark Fae

22:49.953 --> 22:52.035
when you sucked him
dry like a crab leg?

22:52.288 --> 22:53.869
Detective--

22:54.707 --> 22:56.698
What am I going
to do with you?

22:56.960 --> 22:59.121
What am I going
to tell The Morrigan?

22:59.420 --> 23:01.581
Why don't you tell her
to shove it?

23:02.590 --> 23:03.966
Hang on
one second here--

23:04.217 --> 23:06.082
Your new
partner is Dark Fae?

23:06.344 --> 23:08.300
Where were you
one week ago at 11 PM?

23:08.555 --> 23:10.216
Are you kidding me?!

23:10.473 --> 23:11.974
She was with me.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.011
Getting out
of Hecuba prison.

23:14.811 --> 23:15.891
Huh...

23:16.354 --> 23:17.685
Prison.

23:17.939 --> 23:18.803
Well...

23:19.065 --> 23:21.727
At least we know it wasn't
somewhere suspicious.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.597
Come on,
little buddy, pick up.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.093
Listen... You're not
leaving this room

23:59.355 --> 24:01.266
until you come clean about
your little bedtime snack--

24:01.524 --> 24:04.106
who, by the way,
is resting happily in a coma.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.520
Your fault.

24:06.404 --> 24:07.610
You know...

24:07.864 --> 24:08.649
Dyson...

24:08.906 --> 24:10.191
If Kenzi's friend is
still down there,

24:10.450 --> 24:13.283
he could get caught in the
crossfire when you guys go in--

24:13.536 --> 24:15.777
I'm sorry,
was there something else.

24:16.831 --> 24:17.866
Bo.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.113
The Sewer Alligator is--

24:19.375 --> 24:20.330
Atticus.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.249
His name is Atticus.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.915
Atticus is threatening
to out the Fae.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.087
We're under
strict orders here.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.509
Look, Kenzi took this case
to help Aussie on her own.

24:31.763 --> 24:33.424
He was grabbed right
in front of her, Dyson.

24:33.681 --> 24:34.887
She feels responsible.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.642
I'll do everything
I can to find him,

24:36.893 --> 24:38.508
and keep him safe.
That's the best I can do.

24:38.770 --> 24:39.759
Thank you.

24:40.021 --> 24:40.885
Okay.

24:41.147 --> 24:44.014
As good as this little
Bad Cop, Horny Cop routine is,

24:44.275 --> 24:45.811
I'm getting a coffee.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.608
Do you want one?

24:52.158 --> 24:53.068
Wow.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.066
Your new partner's
a real peach.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.785
Yeah, that's not
the word I'd use.

24:58.039 --> 25:00.701
At least she's easy
on the eyes, though.

25:05.380 --> 25:06.244
Yeah.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.918
She's bonafide
marriage material.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.141
What the hell
is this shit?

25:22.480 --> 25:23.469
She an ex,
or something?

25:23.731 --> 25:24.766
Hmm?
One night stand?

25:25.024 --> 25:26.230
Hey, let's get
something straight.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.020
It's not okay for you
to ambush me.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.268
If you have information
on a suspect, you tell me!

25:30.530 --> 25:30.985
Up front!

25:31.239 --> 25:33.104
Who is she?

25:35.702 --> 25:37.363
Are you in love
with this girl?

25:37.620 --> 25:39.156
I know
she didn't do it.

25:39.414 --> 25:40.620
Because when God
was handing out brains

25:40.873 --> 25:42.283
you took a second dick?

25:42.709 --> 25:45.121
Because Bo has been
feeding cleanly and safely

25:45.378 --> 25:46.163
for two years.

25:46.421 --> 25:48.082
This is not about
me and her--

25:48.339 --> 25:50.295
This is about the facts.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.173
Okay.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.001
The coffee was
a bit much.

25:55.263 --> 25:55.843
Yeah, you think?

25:56.097 --> 25:57.007
But...

25:57.265 --> 26:00.007
There are still a lot
of facts that lead to Bo.

26:06.774 --> 26:07.524
Look.

26:07.775 --> 26:08.764
If we are going
to be partners,

26:09.026 --> 26:11.278
you need to learn
to control yourself.

26:11.529 --> 26:12.769
Well, thanks again,
Sergeant.

26:13.030 --> 26:15.282
I'll be sure to have your
detectives back in one piece.

26:15.533 --> 26:16.898
The Mayor gets what
the Mayor wants.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.151
I'll tell him at the next
council meeting

26:19.412 --> 26:21.198
when I'm blowing
smoke up his ass.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.956
Walk with me.

26:30.673 --> 26:32.174
Get the door.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.015
Is there a problem?

26:51.277 --> 26:52.437
No!
No problem.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.902
| just... love
my partner so much,

26:55.156 --> 26:55.861
I want to--

26:56.115 --> 26:57.696
Punch him.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.690
I've heard a certain
Succubus found her way

26:59.952 --> 27:02.409
into the tunnels.
and the Alligator?

27:02.663 --> 27:04.164
Please tell me
that's not right?

27:04.415 --> 27:05.279
That's not right, right?

27:05.541 --> 27:06.121
Look.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.866
Bo's friend was taken
by the Subterranean Fae.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.208
And if I know Bo--

27:10.463 --> 27:11.248
[Clears throat]

27:12.298 --> 27:12.923
[Clears throat]

27:13.174 --> 27:15.039
If I know Bo,
she's not going to rest

27:15.301 --> 27:16.336
until he's good
and rescued.

27:16.594 --> 27:17.583
I don't need this stress.

27:17.845 --> 27:20.222
lam telling you,
I have enough on my plate.

27:20.473 --> 27:21.383
Let me go down first.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.597
I'll find the kid,
that should appease Bo.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.716
May I remind you
these Fae are infected.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.718
If that kid's down there,
he could be

27:27.980 --> 27:29.561
a regular Typhoid
Mary by this point.

27:29.816 --> 27:30.931
Saving him is
not an option.

27:31.192 --> 27:32.807
That is a direct order
from The Ash.

27:33.069 --> 27:33.649
You do remember
The Ash, don't you?

27:33.903 --> 27:34.813
Used to be
your partner?

27:35.071 --> 27:36.607
Yes, I remember him.

27:36.864 --> 27:38.149
Quite fondly.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.489
Not to mention my job as City
Manager is on the line big time.

27:40.743 --> 27:43.234
I can't keep telling the
Mayor there's a gas leak--

27:43.496 --> 27:44.576
He's getting
suspicious and fiery--

27:44.831 --> 27:45.991
I don't mean full of flames,

27:46.249 --> 27:48.991
he's going to fire my ass.
Then the Fae will have lost

27:49.252 --> 27:51.584
the Mayor's office
as well as 39th Division.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.830
The Succubus is locked up.
Keep her locked up!

27:56.008 --> 27:58.590
And bring me
my skinned reptile.

28:05.893 --> 28:09.636
I love her...
she's just so pretty...

28:11.816 --> 28:14.102
That bitch is doomed.

28:16.779 --> 28:17.939
We don't have
much time.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.313
Bo, what if
Aussie's already...

28:21.784 --> 28:22.409
What if he's--

28:22.660 --> 28:23.649
Kenzi.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.651
We will find him.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.494
[Knocking on door]

28:27.748 --> 28:29.329
Oh, shit...

28:32.628 --> 28:34.004
Kenzi?

28:35.882 --> 28:37.088
Aussie...

28:37.550 --> 28:39.131
OMG!

28:39.802 --> 28:41.303
I was so worried
about you!

28:41.554 --> 28:43.419
I thought I'd never
see you again.

28:43.681 --> 28:45.421
What--
What happened?

28:45.683 --> 28:46.638
What are you
talking about?

28:46.893 --> 28:48.679
I saw you at Nuit Sombre,
we went for drinks,

28:48.936 --> 28:50.551
and I said I'd call you.

28:50.813 --> 28:53.555
Sweetie...
You were kidnapped.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.477
Yeah? And what did
the ransom note say?

28:55.735 --> 28:57.475
To Whom It May Concern?

28:59.238 --> 29:00.478
Why are you guys
screwing with me?

29:00.740 --> 29:02.401
We went
for drinks, and--

29:02.658 --> 29:05.149
[Clears throat]
I said I'd call you--

29:05.411 --> 29:06.696
Oh, Aussie!

29:07.747 --> 29:09.283
What's happening to me?

29:09.540 --> 29:10.290
It's okay, babe.

29:10.541 --> 29:12.918
l was...
We were...

29:13.419 --> 29:14.169
Why can't
I remember?

29:14.420 --> 29:16.502
I think I know someone
who may be able to help.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.496
Put this over his eyes.

29:18.758 --> 29:19.713
Why don't you do it?

29:19.967 --> 29:21.127
Because he's dirty
and he smells.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.670
I can hear you.

29:23.346 --> 29:24.506
It's okay, babe.
She can help.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.345
Even if she can't
help herself.

29:26.599 --> 29:32.014
Just pluck a greasy hair
from him and hand it to me.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.932
It's not greasy, okay?
|t's gel.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.521
Okay, ready?

29:35.983 --> 29:36.938
Ugh--

29:37.318 --> 29:39.809
Not sure how I feel about
having an unclaimed

29:40.071 --> 29:40.526
[Whispering]
that

29:40.780 --> 29:42.645
on my premises
while I have 60

29:42.907 --> 29:43.771
[Whispering]
Og res

29:44.033 --> 29:45.239
upstairs for
a Rugby Club reunion.

29:45.493 --> 29:46.528
AUSSIE: I know
who you're talking about.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.697
Shut up, everyone!

29:48.955 --> 29:51.162
I need total quiet.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.451
And Tricky baby...

29:53.709 --> 29:54.869
You owe me
a private dinner

29:55.127 --> 29:57.960
'cause I don't work
with filthy humans-- ever.

29:58.214 --> 29:59.203
Humans? What?

29:59.465 --> 30:01.205
Relax, relax, relax...

30:01.467 --> 30:02.968
Just breath...

30:03.219 --> 30:04.834
There's no place like home.

30:05.096 --> 30:06.211
There's no place like home.

30:06.472 --> 30:07.803
Just... breath.

30:09.767 --> 30:12.509
Now... let's see
what haunts you.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.241
St. Thomas Shipyard.

30:33.499 --> 30:36.912
In the 1700's my kegs would come
from the old country by boat.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.420
That's where I
picked them up.

30:38.671 --> 30:40.787
Aussie must have been
held in the container yard.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.333
How do you know it's
St. Thomas shipyard?

30:42.591 --> 30:43.751
That priest is St. Thomas.

30:44.010 --> 30:44.795
Are you sure?

30:45.052 --> 30:47.259
The Bible is normally
held in the right hand,

30:47.513 --> 30:49.094
but yes.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.011
Aussie!
Look at me.

30:53.269 --> 30:54.019
Just hold on, okay?

30:54.270 --> 30:55.806
TRICK: You two go.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.269
I'll watch the boy.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.808
Go, go, go!

31:07.074 --> 31:09.611
Why isn't there an app
for navigating shipyards?

31:09.869 --> 31:11.609
There's an app for turning
people into Zombies.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.203
Stay calm, Kenz,
we'll find them.

31:14.457 --> 31:19.121
Bo, there is no container 2851.
They don't go past 2000.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.664
That's because,
it was backwards.

31:21.922 --> 31:24.004
We were seeing it
as a mirror image.

31:24.258 --> 31:27.750
That's why Trick said the
Bible was in the wrong hand.

31:28.012 --> 31:30.845
We're not looking
for container 2851

31:32.892 --> 31:35.053
We're looking
for container 1285.

31:35.311 --> 31:35.891
Oh.

31:36.145 --> 31:37.100
Come on.

31:45.905 --> 31:46.644
Okay.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.613
Okay, ready?
On three.

31:49.867 --> 31:51.653
One, two,
two and a half.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.321
Three.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.837
Can you explain to me
how you let her waltz out--

32:10.096 --> 32:12.633
Hey, Tamsin.
We need to talk.

32:12.890 --> 32:13.675
Ah!

32:13.933 --> 32:14.968
Thanks
for coming back.

32:15.226 --> 32:16.511
Was beginning to think
I wasn't gonna get

32:16.769 --> 32:18.054
to kick your cute
little ass today.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.223
Oh, relax, bitch.
I brought gifts.

32:20.481 --> 32:22.893
Recognize any
of these faces?

32:26.779 --> 32:27.894
Ugh.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.983
You must have some
King Kong sized balls

32:34.245 --> 32:36.076
to just waltz back in here
after what you pulled!

32:36.330 --> 32:38.696
I don't think Atticus attacked
those kids at Nuit Sombre.

32:38.958 --> 32:39.697
Big balls and a theory.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.950
They were being
held above ground.

32:42.211 --> 32:44.702
Atticus and his Fae can no
longer exist in sunlight...

32:44.964 --> 32:47.671
He lit a torch when
I was down there

32:47.925 --> 32:49.381
and it looked like he
might burst into flames.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.341
Maybe he wanted you
to think that so he'd

32:51.595 --> 32:52.630
get off the hook
for nabbing humans and--

32:52.888 --> 32:53.718
The kids were bleeding

32:53.973 --> 32:55.964
from the nose and eyes,
just like the Fae underground--

32:56.225 --> 32:57.305
They've caught
the disease.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.551
So, why didn't he
kill Kenzi and |

32:59.812 --> 33:01.143
when he had
the chance, huh?

33:01.397 --> 33:03.012
No.
He gassed us,

33:03.274 --> 33:04.309
he brought us
to our home.

33:04.567 --> 33:05.932
He put us in bed!

33:06.193 --> 33:07.228
Does that sound like a
cold-blooded killer to you?

33:07.486 --> 33:09.272
Bo, I need you
to stay out of this!

33:09.530 --> 33:11.521
Let us do our job.

33:11.782 --> 33:12.692
Please.

33:12.950 --> 33:14.531
[Knocking]

33:24.170 --> 33:25.751
Just trust me...

33:30.676 --> 33:31.631
Okay.

33:33.387 --> 33:35.378
Aren't you supposed
to be watching her?

33:37.808 --> 33:39.309
Can someone please
try to explain to me

33:39.560 --> 33:40.595
why you two aren't
down in the tunnels

33:40.853 --> 33:42.218
solving our
little problem?

33:42.479 --> 33:44.856
Bo found the humans that were
taken from Nuit Sombre.

33:45.107 --> 33:47.519
Not to mention a few others
that have gone missing.

33:47.776 --> 33:48.765
Have you ever considered

33:49.028 --> 33:51.735
that Atticus isn't
behind these attacks?

33:51.989 --> 33:52.273
Holy, mother...

33:52.531 --> 33:55.523
What, are you and this reptile
on a first name basis now?

33:55.784 --> 33:57.570
You guys gonna get a fantasy
baseball league on the go?

33:57.828 --> 34:00.410
You're under a direct order
to eliminate those Fae!

34:00.664 --> 34:02.825
I want it done, now.

34:03.083 --> 34:05.460
You know, maybe I should
take this up with The Ash.

34:05.711 --> 34:06.621
You remember
The Ash, don't you?

34:06.879 --> 34:08.585
My old partner.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.928
Istill love her...

34:18.182 --> 34:19.922
...she's so pretty.

34:20.184 --> 34:21.799
Yeah.

34:22.061 --> 34:25.394
Things are about to get
very bad for you Detective.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.396
You know if I didn't
hate Bo so much...

34:31.654 --> 34:33.485
I might actually
start to like her.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.980
She has that
effect on people.

34:40.913 --> 34:41.663
You sure this is the way?

34:41.914 --> 34:43.905
Passed a tapped city water
pipe about a half mile back

34:44.166 --> 34:46.623
been following rat boy's
spills ever since.

34:46.877 --> 34:47.957
Smartie Pants.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.628
There he is!
The Singing Millionaire.

34:55.886 --> 34:57.296
I thought we were calling
him Detective Power Balls.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.169
You guys call me whatever
you wanna call me.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.843
Just don't call me broke
like your sorry asses.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.056
You win the lottery
and that makes you

35:03.310 --> 35:04.345
a better person than us?

35:04.603 --> 35:06.764
Gentlemen, the Lottery
chooses the winner.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.980
Of course it makes me
better than all of you.

35:10.401 --> 35:12.141
Hey.

35:12.403 --> 35:14.439
I came as fast as I could.
What's the trouble?

35:14.697 --> 35:16.153
I'm having a little issue
with how you want me

35:16.407 --> 35:17.772
to deal with the
subterranean Fae.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.819
I think we need
a proper investigation.

35:20.077 --> 35:21.613
Okay, trust me.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.452
Look, T's have been crossed
and all the l's got eyes.

35:24.707 --> 35:27.949
I know it seems a little cold
but they'll like their new home.

35:28.210 --> 35:28.619
New home?

35:28.877 --> 35:31.289
Yeah, the old guard dealt
with these Faes wrong.

35:31.547 --> 35:33.503
Relocating them is
the right thing to do...

35:33.757 --> 35:36.874
and not just because we need
to put in that new subway line.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.626
Relocating?

35:39.013 --> 35:40.173
Right.

35:40.681 --> 35:42.137
Thanks, bro.

35:44.852 --> 35:46.092
Did it just get
real cold down here?

35:46.353 --> 35:48.935
I'm getting a bad
feeling about this.

36:08.584 --> 36:10.495
The music...

36:10.753 --> 36:11.868
it's so pretty...

36:12.129 --> 36:14.211
like a lullaby...

36:14.465 --> 36:16.421
or birds...

36:17.426 --> 36:19.212
Or a funeral dirge
to a death march...

36:19.470 --> 36:21.586
Show me the way in.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.179
Show me
the secret way in.

36:30.647 --> 36:32.603
It's here...

36:55.839 --> 36:57.340
What the hell was that?

36:57.591 --> 36:58.546
What are you?

36:58.801 --> 36:59.916
Well, I've had many
names over the years...

37:00.177 --> 37:03.795
the Slender Man,
the Erlkonig...

37:04.056 --> 37:06.923
But you probably know me
best as the Pied Piper...

37:07.184 --> 37:08.515
Stop hurting her.

37:08.769 --> 37:10.384
Make me.

37:12.356 --> 37:14.187
You caused this!

37:14.441 --> 37:16.898
Those Fae
were never sick.

37:17.152 --> 37:18.232
This is how you feed.

37:18.487 --> 37:20.148
Clever girl.

37:20.406 --> 37:21.486
I wonder what the
Fae elders would say

37:21.740 --> 37:23.947
about you feeding
on other Fae, huh?

37:24.201 --> 37:26.362
It's kind of a
no-no, ain't it?

37:26.620 --> 37:29.657
But it tastes so good.

37:31.208 --> 37:32.618
l was just supposed
to bring the Fae down here

37:32.876 --> 37:35.208
then release them from my
power but how could I?

37:35.462 --> 37:38.750
Once you've had Kobe Beef
how do you go back to chuck?

37:39.007 --> 37:41.464
Do you understand
the power that I wield?

37:41.718 --> 37:44.846
If they have eyes,
they're mine.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.463
And it's delicious.

37:47.724 --> 37:50.636
They get transfixed
by the music they hear.

37:50.894 --> 37:52.225
In the old days,
| used to carry a pipe

37:52.479 --> 37:54.686
so mortals would put it
down to black magic.

37:54.940 --> 37:55.929
[Whistling]
It was cute.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.476
[Laughing]
Yeah...

37:57.734 --> 38:00.862
Something to tell the mothers
of the children I stole.

38:01.113 --> 38:02.353
You're despicable.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.447
You of all people know
what I'm talking about.

38:05.701 --> 38:07.942
With that messy
little Dark Fae feed

38:08.203 --> 38:10.990
you left out in the open
not two days ago.

38:11.248 --> 38:12.613
Bo, what is he
talking about?

38:12.875 --> 38:15.161
I do hope you can
forgive the intrusion...

38:15.419 --> 38:20.209
but I haven't heard that
voice in over 90 years.

38:24.094 --> 38:25.675
Hello, Atticus.

38:25.929 --> 38:28.136
Robert Hamelin...

38:28.390 --> 38:30.597
The man in black.

38:30.851 --> 38:32.432
Now, I remember.

38:33.312 --> 38:34.051
Funny, how 90 years ago,

38:34.313 --> 38:36.304
I couldn't take
my eyes off you...

38:38.942 --> 38:40.273
How are you--

38:41.236 --> 38:42.646
No one can resist me!

38:42.905 --> 38:44.896
And for that,
I have you to thank.

38:45.157 --> 38:47.068
See, once you've lived
in the dark as long as l have

38:47.326 --> 38:49.237
you lose your
reliance on your eyes

38:49.495 --> 38:52.328
until eventually sight
leaves you altogether.

38:52.581 --> 38:54.913
Only then can you truly
begin to live in the light.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.077
Ahh!

38:56.335 --> 38:57.290
Ugh!

39:01.006 --> 39:02.291
[Dyson snarling]

39:04.760 --> 39:05.715
Rawr!

39:12.017 --> 39:13.006
It's over Hamelin.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.644
I'm taking you in.

39:14.895 --> 39:16.510
I got a better idea.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.521
These two have
a lot to talk about.

39:24.196 --> 39:27.484
Maybe you would like
to be left alone, Atticus?

39:27.741 --> 39:30.278
It's all I've ever wanted.

39:30.786 --> 39:31.741
Now...

39:33.205 --> 39:35.867
lf ya'll kindly
close the door.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.004
Go for it, babe.

39:54.268 --> 39:55.348
You, sir.

39:55.602 --> 39:57.979
You will answer
for my wife and child.

39:58.230 --> 39:59.140
[Growling]

39:59.398 --> 40:00.763
Ahh!

40:09.074 --> 40:10.655
[Laughing]

40:18.250 --> 40:19.160
You had enough?

40:19.418 --> 40:20.203
Yeah.

40:20.460 --> 40:21.540
I've had enough.

40:21.795 --> 40:24.036
I've had enough
of you and that Bo girl.

40:24.298 --> 40:26.163
Bo?

40:26.425 --> 40:28.381
Do I know a Bo?

40:32.639 --> 40:33.389
That...

40:33.640 --> 40:35.346
is for ditching me
in the middle of a case

40:35.601 --> 40:37.808
to go play hero
with your girlfriend.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.222
She's not my girlfriend.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.812
You know, Dyson...
There's so much more

40:43.066 --> 40:45.557
to life than that
unaligned cooz.

40:47.446 --> 40:49.482
Does that blood in
your mouth taste good?

40:49.740 --> 40:50.695
Yeah.

40:57.664 --> 40:59.780
Do | taste good?

41:02.044 --> 41:03.250
Yeah.

41:04.921 --> 41:07.913
But I still don't
want a new partner.

41:08.175 --> 41:10.131
Neither do |.

41:10.469 --> 41:11.549
So, are we cool?

41:11.803 --> 41:13.589
I moved that Fae
that Bo fed off

41:13.847 --> 41:15.963
to the Dark Compound...

41:16.224 --> 41:17.475
When he wakes up,
she's going

41:17.726 --> 41:19.933
to have to pay
for what she did.

41:21.521 --> 41:24.228
When Bo goes down for
feeding off one of mine...

41:24.483 --> 41:26.690
then we'll be cool.

41:29.446 --> 41:31.027
As soon as
Hamelin was killed,

41:31.281 --> 41:33.237
the underground Fae,
Aussie and Kenzi

41:33.492 --> 41:34.652
all stopped being sick.

41:34.910 --> 41:36.901
He'd been feeding off those Fae
for almost a hundred years.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.029
Framing Atticus by
snatching humans in public

41:40.290 --> 41:43.123
and risking outing our
kind is not only stupid...

41:43.377 --> 41:44.583
It was cruel.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.919
The Fae owe you yet
another debt of gratitude.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.164
Well, I'm just glad they've
finally been relocated.

41:50.425 --> 41:52.416
Okay.
Gorgeous.

41:52.678 --> 41:55.841
Let's lay down and relax...

41:56.098 --> 41:59.056
I'm gonna be with
you in a second.

42:00.686 --> 42:03.098
This is private for her.

42:03.355 --> 42:05.391
If you stay, it's like
reading her diary.

42:05.649 --> 42:06.889
BO: Hey.

42:07.150 --> 42:08.731
It's okay.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.064
TRICK: Okay.

42:13.615 --> 42:16.106
All right.

42:16.368 --> 42:17.653
Be brave.

42:17.911 --> 42:21.995
And remember...
I am right here with you.

42:22.249 --> 42:23.204
Okay.

42:24.292 --> 42:25.077
Now.

42:25.335 --> 42:29.374
Let's see what
is haunting you...

42:29.631 --> 42:31.792
And your dreams.

43:08.670 --> 43:09.500
I have to leave.

43:09.755 --> 43:11.165
What? Why?
What did you see?

43:11.423 --> 43:15.757
You know what?
It was so beautiful.

43:16.678 --> 43:19.636
I think it was
something you ate.

43:30.275 --> 43:33.233
Why are people
always lying to me?
