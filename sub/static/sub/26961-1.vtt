Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:50.851 --> 00:53.551
Okay. My turn, my turn.
Um, I got one.

00:53.553 --> 00:54.887
Great, but can you make it

00:54.889 --> 00:56.421
a little more challenging
this time?

00:56.423 --> 00:59.457
Okay. Check this out.

00:59.459 --> 01:03.394
I spy with my little eye...

01:03.396 --> 01:06.865
something yellow...

01:06.867 --> 01:11.269
and round,
and it eats dots.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.706
Seriously, Ralph?

01:13.708 --> 01:16.240
Yeah, seriously.
You're never gonna get it.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.677
Well, obviously,
it's Pac-Man.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.244
No, that's not...

01:20.246 --> 01:21.680
Why is that obvious?

01:21.682 --> 01:23.549
Name one other thing
in this whole arcade

01:23.551 --> 01:25.884
that is yellow and round
and eats dots.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.385
I can name two things.

01:27.387 --> 01:28.587
Ms. Pac-Man
and Baby Pac-Man.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.556
Boom!
I accept your apology.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.759
Yeah, you're right. Okay.
But was it Pac-Man?

01:33.761 --> 01:35.661
Yeah, you got me.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.697
Knew it.
All right, riddle me this...

01:38.699 --> 01:42.401
do you or do you not think
that Zangief waxes?

01:42.403 --> 01:44.335
No way. Look at the guy.
He looks like a yeti.

01:44.337 --> 01:45.704
I don't know.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.740
I mean, if the fur
were confined to his chest,

01:47.742 --> 01:48.907
I might agree...

01:48.909 --> 01:50.442
but look at those
two very specific

01:50.444 --> 01:51.877
tuffets of shin hair...

01:51.879 --> 01:53.412
poking out of his boots.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.448
That does not just happen,
Ralph. That is a choice.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.417
You're totally right, kid.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.719
He's baby smooth
everywhere else.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.721
I rest my case.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.391
My mind is blown!

02:05.393 --> 02:06.792
Let's go get a root beer.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.961
Okay, let's see
what you got, kid.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.630
Ooh!

02:11.632 --> 02:13.632
Nice one. Okay.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.367
I think I got one
in the chamber.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.404
Ew!

02:18.406 --> 02:20.339
- Gross.
- Thank you.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.607
Hey, wanna sneak into <i>Tron?</i>

02:21.609 --> 02:23.442
Doesn't that game
have a virus?

02:23.444 --> 02:25.911
No. I'm sure
they fixed it.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.780
Whoo!

02:27.782 --> 02:30.249
I'm gonna beat
my speed record!

02:30.251 --> 02:31.752
Hey, wait for me!

02:40.628 --> 02:41.927
Ralph.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.462
Yeah?

02:43.464 --> 02:45.633
I don't think
they fixed the game.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.702
Uh... No.

02:48.803 --> 02:49.704
Help!

02:50.604 --> 02:51.972
Hey, Tron!

02:52.773 --> 02:53.774
Tronny!

02:55.276 --> 02:56.510
Tronny boy!

02:56.844 --> 02:58.512
Help!

02:59.580 --> 03:00.846
Do you realize

03:00.848 --> 03:03.549
we're basically just, like,
zeroes and ones...

03:03.551 --> 03:07.319
floating around the universe
like tiny specks of dust?

03:07.321 --> 03:08.687
Like, doesn't the very nature

03:08.689 --> 03:10.456
of our existence
make you wonder...

03:10.458 --> 03:12.791
if there's more to life
than this?

03:12.793 --> 03:14.660
Why would I wonder
if there's more to life

03:14.662 --> 03:16.895
when the life
I got is perfect?

03:16.897 --> 03:19.531
I mean, sure. Doesn't
look so hot on paper.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.500
<i>I'm just a bad guy
from some old video game</i>

03:21.502 --> 03:22.668
<i>who wrecks a building.</i>

03:22.670 --> 03:24.303
<i>And yeah, for 27 years,</i>

03:24.305 --> 03:26.605
<i>I was a total zero
without any friends.</i>

03:26.607 --> 03:28.674
But now,
I got a best friend...

03:28.676 --> 03:29.942
who just happens to be

03:29.944 --> 03:31.810
the coolest kid
in the whole arcade.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.812
Aw, thanks, pal.

03:33.814 --> 03:34.815
Watch this.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.985
Home run!

03:38.987 --> 03:40.521
All right, let's go
watch the sunrise.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.888
Are you really saying

03:42.890 --> 03:44.991
there's not one single,
solitary thing...

03:44.993 --> 03:47.060
about your life
that you would change?

03:47.062 --> 03:49.062
Well, think about it.

03:49.064 --> 03:51.998
You and me get to
goof off all night long.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.633
Litwak shows up, we go to
work, we put in our hours.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.002
Then the arcade closes

03:56.004 --> 03:58.004
and we get to do it
all over again.

03:58.006 --> 04:00.706
The only thing I might do
different in that scenario...

04:00.708 --> 04:02.741
would be not having
to go to work.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.544
Other than that,
I wouldn't change a thing.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.745
Huh?

04:06.747 --> 04:09.983
Hey, where'd our sunrise go?

04:09.985 --> 04:12.020
All right,
let's get you plugged in.

04:13.889 --> 04:15.922
That's a plug-in alert.

04:15.924 --> 04:18.423
Litwak hasn't plugged in
a new game in forever.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.591
- Let's go see what it is!
- Yeah!

04:20.594 --> 04:22.694
Excuse us. Excuse us.
Minor emergency.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.931
Hey, Felix, Calhoun,
what's getting plugged in?

04:24.933 --> 04:26.565
Well, Ralph, Sonic thinks

04:26.567 --> 04:28.634
it's gonna be
a new pinball machine.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.136
What do you think,
lady love?

04:30.138 --> 04:33.773
I'll bet you a shiny nickel
it's a blood pressure machine.

04:33.775 --> 04:35.875
- Kids love those things.
- Ooh.

04:36.878 --> 04:39.611
Please be a racing game.
Please be a racing game.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.448
Please be a racing game.

04:43.852 --> 04:46.552
"Whiffee"? Or, "Wifey"?

04:46.554 --> 04:49.823
Well, it's either wiffle ball,
or an arranged marriage game.

04:49.825 --> 04:51.557
It's actually pronounced
"Wi-Fi," Ralph.

04:51.559 --> 04:52.725
Yeah, that's what I said.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.459
And Wi-Fi is the Internet...

04:54.461 --> 04:55.728
which is an online community

04:55.730 --> 04:56.896
where human beings
go to shop...

04:56.898 --> 04:58.731
and play games and socialize.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.499
Ooh, fun!

05:00.501 --> 05:01.901
Oh, no, it is not.

05:01.903 --> 05:04.137
That sign right there
says "Wi-Fi."

05:04.139 --> 05:06.606
What it should say
is "Die-Fi."

05:09.110 --> 05:10.844
That's a little humor there.

05:10.846 --> 05:12.946
But seriously, the Internet
is nothing to laugh at.

05:12.948 --> 05:14.714
It is new, it is different,

05:14.716 --> 05:16.149
and therefore
we should fear it.

05:16.151 --> 05:18.551
So keep out, for Pete's sake,
and get to work.

05:18.553 --> 05:20.653
The arcade's about to open.

05:20.655 --> 05:23.523
Figures, we finally get
something new plugged in...

05:23.525 --> 05:25.457
and we're not even allowed
to go in there.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.426
Totally not fair.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.996
A new racing game
would've been cool.

05:29.998 --> 05:31.030
Something wrong
with your game?

05:31.032 --> 05:32.599
No, no.

05:32.601 --> 05:35.001
It's just every bonus level's
been unlocked.

05:35.003 --> 05:37.003
I know every shortcut.

05:37.005 --> 05:39.772
Man, I'd kill for even
just a new track.

05:39.774 --> 05:42.675
New track? You already got,
like, three choices.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.010
Yeah, I know,
but don't you ever wish

05:44.012 --> 05:45.445
something new
and different...

05:45.447 --> 05:46.779
would happen in your game?

05:46.781 --> 05:47.847
Nope.

05:47.849 --> 05:50.950
Really? Well,
agree to disagree.

05:50.952 --> 05:52.819
Wait, I don't wanna disagree.

05:52.821 --> 05:54.520
No, no. It's just
a fancy way to say

05:54.522 --> 05:56.022
we don't have to
argue about it.

05:56.024 --> 05:57.857
We're arguing?
I don't wanna argue.

05:57.859 --> 06:00.560
Relax. Stop making it
a thing.

06:00.562 --> 06:03.196
Go to work. I'll see you
tonight, stench vessel.

06:03.198 --> 06:04.163
All right.

06:09.504 --> 06:11.840
She wants a new track,
I'll give her a new track.

06:16.077 --> 06:18.013
Come on, Nafisa!
Let's play <i>Sugar Rush!</i>

06:19.681 --> 06:20.847
Pick Vanellope, Swati.

06:20.849 --> 06:22.582
She's got
the best superpower.

06:22.584 --> 06:24.984
Yeah, the glitch. I love her.

06:24.986 --> 06:25.985
<i>Drivers,</i>

06:25.987 --> 06:28.221
<i>start your engines.</i>

06:28.223 --> 06:31.090
You're gonna lose today,
Princess.

06:31.092 --> 06:34.228
While, yes, I am technically
a princess, Taffyta...

06:34.230 --> 06:37.231
I'd rather you just think of
me as plain old Vanellope...

06:37.233 --> 06:39.732
the racer who's about to
kick your butt.

06:39.734 --> 06:42.637
<i>Three, two, one, go!</i>

06:46.942 --> 06:49.678
And pardon me, excuse me,
coming through.

06:53.014 --> 06:54.547
Whoo-hoo!

06:54.549 --> 06:55.850
Whoo!

06:57.585 --> 07:01.888
And one, two, three gumballs
right on cue.

07:01.890 --> 07:03.856
Yeah, I love it
when she glitches.

07:08.663 --> 07:09.829
Ooh! Huh.

07:09.831 --> 07:11.931
Excuse me.
I must have fallen asleep.

07:11.933 --> 07:14.068
Oh, fun. I'm winning.

07:16.072 --> 07:17.870
<i>Vanellope takes a huge lead.</i>

07:17.872 --> 07:20.508
<i>No one's gonna catch her now.</i>

07:24.080 --> 07:26.246
She's gonna love this.

07:27.749 --> 07:29.185
Right on time.

07:31.619 --> 07:32.785
What?

07:32.787 --> 07:34.756
"Looking for something new...

07:35.590 --> 07:37.057
"and different?

07:37.059 --> 07:40.127
"Then take this track."

07:40.129 --> 07:42.162
Oh, Ralph,
you old son-of-a-gun.

07:42.164 --> 07:44.630
I'd say I got a little time
for a detour.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.066
Whoa!

07:46.068 --> 07:48.936
Hey, look, I think
I unlocked a new track.

07:48.938 --> 07:51.704
Never seen that before.

07:52.807 --> 07:55.142
This is awesome!

07:55.144 --> 07:57.311
Hey, thanks, Ralph!

07:57.313 --> 07:59.113
You're welcome!

07:59.115 --> 08:00.881
Get back up
on the track, Swati.

08:00.883 --> 08:02.249
You're going to lose.

08:02.251 --> 08:04.719
I can't.
It's like it's driving itself.

08:06.721 --> 08:09.923
Whoo!

08:09.925 --> 08:11.826
What is wrong with
this thing?

08:12.261 --> 08:14.161
What?

08:19.835 --> 08:22.104
No, no!

08:22.604 --> 08:23.605
Kid!

08:31.113 --> 08:32.980
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

08:32.982 --> 08:34.948
Kid! Kid!

08:34.950 --> 08:36.682
Oh, kid, I'm so sorry,
are you okay?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.683
Oh, my gosh.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.120
What an amazing track!

08:40.121 --> 08:42.956
Thank you, Ralph! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

08:42.957 --> 08:44.291
You're welcome!

08:44.293 --> 08:46.860
You know I take my duty
as your hero very seriously.

08:46.862 --> 08:48.028
Wait a minute.

08:48.030 --> 08:49.930
You took a serious
doody where?

08:52.001 --> 08:53.367
Vanellope, get up here.

08:53.369 --> 08:55.004
We have a situation.

08:56.338 --> 09:00.207
Mr. Litwak, the Vanellope
racer wasn't working...

09:00.209 --> 09:03.177
and I think maybe I
turned the wheel too hard.

09:03.179 --> 09:05.012
- Whoa.
- I'm real sorry.

09:05.014 --> 09:06.346
It's okay, Swati.

09:06.348 --> 09:08.215
I think I can get it back
on there pretty easy.

09:08.217 --> 09:10.717
- What did you do, Ralph?
- Nothing.

09:10.719 --> 09:11.819
Leave him alone.

09:11.821 --> 09:13.754
He was just trying to
make the game more exciting.

09:13.756 --> 09:16.757
Yeah, why don't you relax,
Taffyta? Litwak will fix it.

09:16.759 --> 09:18.759
All right, on you...

09:18.761 --> 09:20.360
Oh!

09:20.362 --> 09:22.696
Okay. Still not a problem.

09:22.698 --> 09:23.897
He'll just order a new part.

09:23.899 --> 09:25.165
Well, I'd order a new part...

09:25.167 --> 09:26.867
but the company
that made <i>Sugar Rush</i>

09:26.869 --> 09:28.035
went out of business
years ago.

09:29.338 --> 09:30.904
I can try to find one
on the Internet.

09:30.906 --> 09:32.005
- Good idea.
- Oh, me too.

09:32.007 --> 09:33.774
Good luck, that'll be like
finding a needle in a...

09:33.776 --> 09:35.309
I found one! On ebay!

09:35.311 --> 09:37.044
Really? How about that?

09:37.046 --> 09:39.246
See? Those kids
have it under control.

09:39.248 --> 09:41.281
They're just gonna get
another wheel from the eboy.

09:41.283 --> 09:43.083
Are you
kidding me? How much?

09:43.085 --> 09:45.385
That's more than this game
makes in a year.

09:45.387 --> 09:47.020
Aw, I hate to say it,

09:47.022 --> 09:49.356
but my salvage guy
is coming on Friday...

09:49.358 --> 09:52.159
and it might be time to sell
<i>Sugar Rush</i> for parts.

09:52.161 --> 09:55.229
- Aww.
- Where's he going?

09:55.231 --> 09:56.897
Litwak's gonna
unplug the game.

09:56.899 --> 09:58.031
Get out of here!
Go, scram, let's go, run!

09:58.033 --> 09:59.467
Go, run, run,
run, run!

09:59.469 --> 10:00.302
- Let's go!
- Run!

10:08.744 --> 10:10.043
Gangway!

10:10.045 --> 10:11.078
Yeah,
you heard him, gangway!

10:11.080 --> 10:13.213
Stop it! No running!

10:13.215 --> 10:15.115
What are you people doing
out of your game,

10:15.117 --> 10:16.283
for Peter's sake?

10:16.285 --> 10:18.252
The arcade is open!

10:18.254 --> 10:20.053
<i>Sugar Rush</i>
is getting unplugged.

10:26.862 --> 10:30.130
- We're homeless!
- Yeah, yeah, we're homeless!

10:30.132 --> 10:32.766
Oh, what are we going to do?

10:32.768 --> 10:36.170
Y'all, calm down, calm down.
Get a hold of yourselves.

10:36.172 --> 10:37.804
I don't want to be gameless.

10:38.908 --> 10:41.008
An unplugging.
Good Lord.

10:41.010 --> 10:43.110
I haven't seen
this many gameless characters

10:43.112 --> 10:45.114
since <i>Space Invaders</i>
went down.

10:45.315 --> 10:46.914
Um...

10:46.916 --> 10:48.949
Where are we gonna live?

10:48.951 --> 10:51.319
Well, you can stay here until
the arcade closes, I guess...

10:51.321 --> 10:52.853
and then we'll figure out

10:52.855 --> 10:54.757
where the heck
we're gonna put you all.

11:09.772 --> 11:10.973
Okay.

11:11.474 --> 11:13.174
Here we go.

11:13.176 --> 11:14.442
I raided Gene's fridge.

11:14.444 --> 11:16.843
Good news, he's got pie.

11:16.845 --> 11:18.346
Took a bunch of his pillows
and junk, too.

11:18.348 --> 11:21.782
I'm thinking we make a fort
up here, or like a yurt.

11:21.784 --> 11:23.484
Or we could take
these pillows...

11:23.486 --> 11:24.851
If we stack them right,

11:24.853 --> 11:26.954
we can make an igloo
out of pillows.

11:26.956 --> 11:30.124
Like a pillow igloo.
Pigloo. Pigloo!

11:30.126 --> 11:31.092
So what do you think, kid?

11:31.094 --> 11:34.164
Fort, yurt, or the obvious
best choice, pigloo?

11:35.798 --> 11:39.167
I can't believe I don't have
a game anymore.

11:39.169 --> 11:42.337
I mean, like, what am I
gonna do all day?

11:42.339 --> 11:45.006
What? Come on,
are you kidding?

11:45.008 --> 11:46.474
You sleep in,
you do no work,

11:46.476 --> 11:48.875
then you go to Tapper's
with me every night.

11:48.877 --> 11:50.844
I've literally
just described paradise.

11:50.846 --> 11:52.846
But I loved my game.

11:52.848 --> 11:53.814
Oh, come on.

11:53.816 --> 11:55.116
You were just bellyaching
about the tracks

11:55.118 --> 11:56.284
being too easy.

11:56.286 --> 11:58.453
No, that doesn't mean
I didn't love it.

11:58.455 --> 12:02.190
Yeah, sure,
it was kind of predictable...

12:02.192 --> 12:06.827
but still I never really knew
what might happen in a race.

12:06.829 --> 12:08.396
And it's that,
it's that feeling,

12:08.398 --> 12:11.366
that not-knowing-what's-
coming-next feeling.

12:11.368 --> 12:15.438
That's the stuff.
That feels like life to me.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.807
And if I'm not a racer,
Ralph...

12:20.844 --> 12:22.176
what am I?

12:22.178 --> 12:23.544
Well, you're my best friend.

12:23.546 --> 12:24.979
That's not enough.

12:24.981 --> 12:26.114
Hey.

12:26.116 --> 12:27.949
No, I just...

12:27.951 --> 12:30.920
I'm sorry,
I know I'm being weird.

12:32.856 --> 12:36.524
I think maybe I just need
to be alone right now.

12:36.526 --> 12:37.560
Oh.

12:38.628 --> 12:41.095
Okay.

12:41.097 --> 12:43.566
I'll meet you over at Tapper's
in a little while, I guess.

12:44.534 --> 12:46.303
If you want.

12:48.505 --> 12:50.104
<i>All right, now...</i>

12:50.106 --> 12:51.372
<i>we found some good homes</i>

12:51.374 --> 12:53.308
<i>for so many of our chums</i>
<i>from</i> Sugar Rush...

12:53.310 --> 12:55.076
and we're just hoping
a few more of you

12:55.078 --> 12:56.244
will open your doors...

12:56.246 --> 12:58.246
and your hearts
to those in need.

12:58.248 --> 13:01.049
Well, I suppose
that large green olive

13:01.051 --> 13:02.884
will fit in nicely
with my decor.

13:02.886 --> 13:05.119
I'm a sour ball.

13:05.121 --> 13:07.922
Well, beggars can't be
choosers, can they?

13:07.924 --> 13:09.457
Come along, condiment.

13:09.459 --> 13:11.225
Mm-kay.

13:11.227 --> 13:14.197
Marvelous.
That just leaves the racers.

13:14.998 --> 13:16.597
We're, like, adorable.

13:16.599 --> 13:18.366
You sure are.

13:18.368 --> 13:20.535
So, any takers?

13:23.106 --> 13:24.505
Um...

13:24.507 --> 13:26.242
Anyone?

13:29.412 --> 13:32.480
Felix, I know
we've never once talked about

13:32.482 --> 13:34.449
having a family before, but...

13:34.451 --> 13:36.351
I know, it feels
like the kind of thing

13:36.353 --> 13:37.919
you just jump into
with both feet...

13:37.921 --> 13:39.655
and nary a plan.

13:39.657 --> 13:42.457
Felix and I will
give them sanctuary.

13:43.561 --> 13:44.992
Can I get a quick word
with you two?

13:48.131 --> 13:49.397
Look, I get it.

13:49.399 --> 13:51.099
You've been married
six years,

13:51.101 --> 13:52.501
you're looking to
spice things up...

13:52.503 --> 13:54.603
but trust me,
adopting 15 children

13:54.605 --> 13:56.437
is the wrong kind of spice.

13:56.439 --> 13:58.373
Those things
are basically feral.

13:58.375 --> 14:03.378
Pardon me, sir, but those
youngsters are lambs.

14:03.380 --> 14:07.181
Lost little lambs in need of
two kind, caring shepherds.

14:07.183 --> 14:08.349
That's right.

14:08.351 --> 14:11.520
Besides, how hard
can parenting be?

14:11.522 --> 14:13.354
You treat the child
like your best friend...

14:13.356 --> 14:15.223
you give them
everything they want...

14:15.225 --> 14:16.658
and you just love
their little socks off.

14:16.660 --> 14:18.025
Right, Tammy?

14:18.027 --> 14:19.595
Darn-tootin'.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.262
Huh?

14:22.332 --> 14:23.432
Come and get it.

14:23.434 --> 14:24.500
Get your own candle.

14:24.502 --> 14:27.168
Hey, Mom,
why does your lame TV

14:27.170 --> 14:28.670
only have one channel?

14:28.672 --> 14:31.540
Well,
hate to say I told ya...

14:31.542 --> 14:33.141
Ow!

14:43.987 --> 14:45.153
Hey, Tapper?

14:45.155 --> 14:47.256
No, Ralph.
I haven't seen Vanellope.

14:47.258 --> 14:50.325
Not since the last time
you asked me 30 seconds ago.

14:50.327 --> 14:52.561
Sorry. I'm just
worried about her.

14:52.563 --> 14:56.632
She's glitching like crazy,
and acting super insecure.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.667
Oh. And get this,
she said...

14:58.669 --> 15:01.171
being friends with me
wasn't enough for her.

15:02.172 --> 15:04.038
Not enough?
I'm a great friend!

15:04.040 --> 15:05.707
Right, Tapper? Right?

15:05.709 --> 15:08.075
I'm sorry.
Who's acting insecure?

15:08.077 --> 15:09.445
Ralph, come on.

15:09.447 --> 15:12.247
The kid just lost her game.
Give her a break.

15:13.484 --> 15:15.350
There you are... Oh.

15:15.352 --> 15:16.452
Hey, Ralph.

15:16.454 --> 15:19.020
Hey, Felix. Since when
do you drink root beer?

15:19.022 --> 15:20.255
Since tonight.

15:20.257 --> 15:22.291
Yeah, I hear you, buddy.

15:22.293 --> 15:24.526
Hey, listen. This one was
supposed to be for Vanellope.

15:24.528 --> 15:25.694
I guess you can have it.

15:25.696 --> 15:27.429
Doesn't look like
she's coming.

15:27.431 --> 15:28.597
Thanks.

15:28.599 --> 15:30.299
You know,
I can't help but think

15:30.301 --> 15:32.501
this whole mess
is somehow...

15:32.503 --> 15:35.204
partially my fault.

15:35.206 --> 15:38.273
It figures. Just when
my life was perfect.

15:38.275 --> 15:40.108
Mine was, too.

15:40.110 --> 15:43.512
But, hey,
now I'm a father of 15.

15:43.514 --> 15:46.114
Isn't that just a blessing?

15:49.753 --> 15:53.155
Eeeee-oh-boy!

15:53.157 --> 15:55.424
Wait. What'd
you say, Felix?

15:55.426 --> 15:57.626
Um, isn't that
just a blessing?

15:57.628 --> 15:59.228
No, the weird sound thing.

15:59.230 --> 16:00.696
Oh. Eeeee-oh-boy?

16:00.698 --> 16:02.731
Yeah. Eee-oh...

16:02.733 --> 16:04.099
Sorry, say it again?

16:04.101 --> 16:06.101
- Eeeee-oh-boy.
- Eeeee-oh-boy!

16:06.103 --> 16:08.237
- Eee-oh-boy!
- Eee-boy! Say it again?

16:08.239 --> 16:09.404
- Eeeee-oh-boy!
- Eeeee-oh-boy.

16:09.406 --> 16:11.740
- Eeeee-oh-boy...
- eboy! eboy! eboy!

16:11.742 --> 16:12.841
- eboy? eboy?
- eboy.

16:12.843 --> 16:14.576
Yeah.

16:14.578 --> 16:15.777
Um, what are you getting
at there, Ralph?

16:15.779 --> 16:17.546
That kid out in the arcade

16:17.548 --> 16:19.181
said there was
a steering wheel part...

16:19.183 --> 16:22.384
on the Internet, it's
something called eboy or...

16:22.386 --> 16:24.786
ebay! That's it,
it was ebay!

16:24.788 --> 16:26.455
Ralph, are you thinking about

16:26.457 --> 16:28.790
going to the Internet
and finding that part?

16:28.792 --> 16:29.926
Getting that part's
the only thing

16:29.928 --> 16:31.827
that's gonna fix the game
and that's the only thing

16:31.829 --> 16:33.830
that's gonna make
Vanellope happy again.

16:33.832 --> 16:35.664
And if <i>Sugar Rush</i> is fixed,

16:35.666 --> 16:37.799
all those lovable scamps
living in my house...

16:37.801 --> 16:40.202
and destroying my sanity

16:40.204 --> 16:42.638
will have homes
of their own again!

16:42.640 --> 16:45.741
Ralph, this is an important mission.
A noble mission!

16:45.743 --> 16:46.742
I will cover for you.

16:46.744 --> 16:48.677
Thanks, pal.

16:48.679 --> 16:51.346
Ralph, what about your tab?
You owe me for the root beer.

16:51.348 --> 16:53.115
Oh, Felix is gonna
cover for me.

16:53.117 --> 16:55.517
Drinks on the house, everybody!
Felix is paying.

16:55.519 --> 16:57.354
Shoryuken!

16:57.856 --> 16:59.657
Eeeee-oh-boy.

17:06.497 --> 17:08.396
Boo!

17:08.398 --> 17:10.531
Ralph, what is wrong
with you?

17:10.534 --> 17:11.867
Start churning butter

17:11.869 --> 17:14.469
and put on your church
shoes, little sister...

17:14.471 --> 17:17.439
'cause we're about to
blast off!

17:17.441 --> 17:19.641
What are you
even talking about?

17:19.643 --> 17:20.710
Oh, we're going to
the Internet.

17:20.712 --> 17:21.644
What?

17:21.646 --> 17:23.478
Yeah, to find the part
to fix your game.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.546
No way!

17:24.548 --> 17:25.781
Yeah, I probably
should've just said,

17:25.784 --> 17:27.549
"We're going to the Internet."
We're going to the Internet!

17:27.550 --> 17:29.752
Yeah, we are!

17:29.754 --> 17:32.487
Hey, Surge,
are we glad to see you.

17:32.489 --> 17:33.856
We want to report
some malfeasance

17:33.858 --> 17:35.324
over by the <i>Whac-A-Mole.</i>

17:35.326 --> 17:36.893
Yeah, we saw
some undesirables

17:36.895 --> 17:39.528
causing a real donnybrook
over there.

17:39.530 --> 17:41.664
Oh, heck no.
Not on my watch.

17:41.666 --> 17:42.867
Appreciate the tip.

17:48.238 --> 17:50.238
So, all we gotta do
is find this eboy place.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.841
- Ebay.
- Right, ebay.

17:51.843 --> 17:54.176
So we go there,
get the steering wheel...

17:54.178 --> 17:55.678
we have it delivered
to Litwak before Friday.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.245
He'll fix your game.

17:57.247 --> 17:58.815
Everything goes back
to the way it was.

17:58.817 --> 18:00.617
Boom! Happily ever after.

18:00.619 --> 18:02.250
This is a shockingly sound,

18:02.252 --> 18:03.753
well-thought-out idea
for you, Ralph.

18:03.755 --> 18:04.887
No offense.

18:04.889 --> 18:06.421
I know. And none taken.

18:06.423 --> 18:07.590
Ooh, here it comes.

18:07.592 --> 18:09.659
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

18:09.661 --> 18:11.863
I give you the Internet!

18:15.232 --> 18:16.566
Huh.

18:16.568 --> 18:18.601
The Internet is
not nearly as impressive

18:18.603 --> 18:20.470
as how Sonic described it.

18:20.472 --> 18:22.739
Yeah, I gotta admit,
I'm underwhelmed.

18:22.741 --> 18:25.273
Where do you think
they keep their ebay?

18:25.275 --> 18:26.241
Beats me.

18:26.243 --> 18:28.343
Hello, anybody here?

18:28.345 --> 18:29.779
Anyone? Hello!

18:29.781 --> 18:31.948
We're looking for ebay!

18:31.950 --> 18:34.851
Ooh. Did you hear that, kid?
Sweet echo.

18:34.853 --> 18:36.318
Check this out.

18:39.524 --> 18:42.392
Hoolie-hoo!
Hoolie-hoo!

18:42.394 --> 18:44.594
Okay, connect to network.

18:44.596 --> 18:46.696
Bingo.

18:46.698 --> 18:50.769
Password is "high score"
with a zero instead of an "o."

18:51.436 --> 18:52.602
Yes.

18:52.604 --> 18:54.839
And we are online.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.980
Hoolie-hoo!

19:03.982 --> 19:06.582
Hoolie-hoolie-hoo!

19:06.584 --> 19:08.284
Ooh, Ralph, look.

19:08.286 --> 19:10.553
Cool. Mood lighting.

19:14.693 --> 19:15.758
Ahhh! That's a gremlin!
Stay away! It's a gremlin!

19:15.760 --> 19:17.228
It looks like
a tiny Mr. Litwak.

19:19.364 --> 19:21.266
<i>IP address 415-1037-483.</i>

19:22.534 --> 19:24.701
Oh, cool! Come on, Ralph,
let's follow him!

19:24.703 --> 19:26.869
Hey, wait for me!
Kid, come back! Wait!

19:26.871 --> 19:28.838
Hey!
Don't leave without me!

19:28.840 --> 19:30.306
<i>IP address 415-1037-483.</i>

19:31.309 --> 19:32.610
Vanellope!

19:34.612 --> 19:36.412
I can't breathe.
I don't fit.

19:40.285 --> 19:42.018
Whoo-hoo!

19:42.020 --> 19:45.321
Yeah! Whoo!

19:57.502 --> 19:58.701
Kid!

19:58.703 --> 20:00.503
Ralph! Isn't this great?

20:00.505 --> 20:02.405
No, it is not!

20:02.407 --> 20:03.808
Whoo-hoo!

20:08.981 --> 20:10.080
No, no, no.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.989
Whoa!

20:45.918 --> 20:47.951
Sweet mother
of monkey milk!

20:47.953 --> 20:49.987
Whoa!

20:49.989 --> 20:52.455
Kid, I don't think
we're in Litwak's anymore.

20:52.457 --> 20:55.424
We most certainly
are not, friendo.

20:55.426 --> 20:58.530
We are in the Internet!
Come on, Ralph!

21:07.039 --> 21:09.039
Holy cow!

21:09.041 --> 21:10.406
Look at all this stuff.

21:10.408 --> 21:11.707
Whoa.

21:11.709 --> 21:15.580
This is the most beautiful
miracle I've ever seen.

21:16.849 --> 21:18.648
But it's so big.

21:18.650 --> 21:20.884
It goes on
forever and ever.

21:20.886 --> 21:22.418
How are we
possibly gonna find

21:22.420 --> 21:23.619
ebay out there?

21:23.621 --> 21:26.422
Hey, kid. Kid, don't worry.

21:26.424 --> 21:27.658
I'm sure
there's someone out here

21:27.660 --> 21:29.660
who could give us directions.
Oh!

21:29.662 --> 21:31.061
Look at that little egg guy.

21:31.063 --> 21:32.796
He's got on one of those hats
that smart people wear.

21:32.798 --> 21:34.631
I bet he could
help us. Come on.

21:34.633 --> 21:36.399
Welcome back
to the search bar, madam.

21:36.401 --> 21:37.466

21:51.116 --> 21:54.117
Oh, little Madeline's
trying ballet now, is she?

21:54.119 --> 21:55.955
I hope this lasts longer
than the soccer phase.

21:58.691 --> 21:59.823
Hmm.

21:59.825 --> 22:01.692
I found 23 million results

Oh, hello, sir.

22:13.772 --> 22:15.739
Interesting, you don't seem to
have a search history.

22:15.741 --> 22:17.174
Well, let's start one for you.

22:29.154 --> 22:30.988

Humpty Dumpty together again.

22:30.990 --> 22:32.856
This guy's
a little soft-boiled.

22:32.858 --> 22:33.991
I'm pretty sure
he's just trying to

22:33.993 --> 22:35.492
guess what you're gonna say.

22:35.494 --> 22:36.760
Yes. I'm sorry,

22:36.762 --> 22:39.529

a pair of goggles.

how this game works?

24:56.102 --> 24:59.270
I think all you have to do is
yell out the biggest number...

24:59.272 --> 25:01.806
and then you win this stuff.

25:01.808 --> 25:03.707
And I thought
Qbert's game was weird.

25:03.709 --> 25:04.674
Hey, kid, hop up here...

25:04.676 --> 25:05.977

their steering wheels.

26:36.437 --> 26:38.703
I'll just need
a credit card number.

26:38.705 --> 26:40.405
Sorry, what's a
credit card number?

26:40.407 --> 26:42.874
A credit card number.

26:42.876 --> 26:45.078
Number. Right.
Uh, seven.

26:45.712 --> 26:47.078
Excuse me?

26:47.080 --> 26:50.114
Sorry, no. You're right,
ridiculous. I meant 11.

26:50.116 --> 26:51.916
Those aren't
credit card numbers.

26:51.918 --> 26:53.418
I'm pretty sure they are.

26:53.420 --> 26:55.119
How exactly do you intend
to pay for this item, sir?

26:55.121 --> 26:57.356
You owe $27,001.

26:57.358 --> 26:58.923
What?

26:58.925 --> 27:01.326
Dollars? Dollars like money?

Uh...

27:09.836 --> 27:11.438
You're gonna laugh. Okay.

27:13.407 --> 27:17.241
So this big galoot, he
left his wallet at home.

27:17.243 --> 27:20.111
Yeah, yeah, I did leave
my wallet at home,

27:20.113 --> 27:21.948
in my wallet room.
And the door's locked.

27:22.383 --> 27:23.915
Uh-huh.

27:23.917 --> 27:26.184
Look. If you don't pay
within 24 hours...

27:26.186 --> 27:28.353

27:35.329 --> 27:37.429
Well, I got some free advice
for you. Don't.

27:37.431 --> 27:39.431
What a scam!

27:39.433 --> 27:42.203
We were so close,
and we would have gotten...

27:43.304 --> 27:45.404
Look, their signs
aren't even real!

27:50.777 --> 27:53.212
What the heck? Dang Internet.

Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.019
Hey, kid. What's going on?
What's wrong?

28:02.021 --> 28:03.188
If I don't have
a steering wheel,

28:03.190 --> 28:05.390
I don't have a game,
I'm gameless.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.360
There's only one steering
wheel in the whole Internet...

28:08.362 --> 28:11.163
and we blew our chance
to get it. We blew it!

28:11.165 --> 28:13.131

28:19.872 --> 28:21.839
There you go.

28:21.841 --> 28:24.042
Now look,
all we got to do...

28:24.044 --> 28:27.145
is figure out a way to earn
a little bit of moola.

28:27.147 --> 28:30.549
We're video game characters,
Ralph. We don't have moola.

28:30.551 --> 28:32.251
Unless you can think
of some magical way

29:11.358 --> 29:12.557
Sorry. You're getting close
to the edge.

29:12.559 --> 29:13.659
Huh?

29:29.243 --> 29:31.410
This is your website?

29:31.412 --> 29:33.078
I know what you're thinking,
not to worry.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.613
My anti-virus guy
was just here.

29:34.615 --> 29:36.014
Clean as a...

29:36.016 --> 29:37.416
Oh!

29:37.418 --> 29:38.517
Dang it!

29:38.519 --> 29:39.618
Oh, my gosh.
That's embarrassing.

29:39.620 --> 29:41.486
Anyway, I know
it's a bit of a mess...

29:41.488 --> 29:43.055
Hey, Gord!

29:43.057 --> 29:44.623
But I do have a system here,
I really do.

29:44.625 --> 29:46.925
If I can just
find that... Gord!

29:46.927 --> 29:49.094
I just got to find this list.

29:49.096 --> 29:50.329
Oh, there you are.

29:50.331 --> 29:53.365
These guys are looking to
get rich playing video games.

29:53.367 --> 29:54.535
What do you got for them,
partner?

30:03.611 --> 30:05.477
Thank you.

30:05.479 --> 30:09.114
"Fishwife's amulet,
<i>Wizard Quest,</i> three dollars."

30:09.116 --> 30:11.083
"Foxhole hammer,

30:11.085 --> 30:12.984
<i>"Zombie Crusades,</i>
five dollars"?

30:12.986 --> 30:14.519
Now, those there are

30:14.521 --> 30:16.988
some of your more
commonplace, low-dollar items.

30:16.990 --> 30:19.191
Can you back up a sec,
Mr. Spamley?

30:19.193 --> 30:21.259
Um, you're saying if we find

30:21.261 --> 30:22.994
the Golden Cleats

30:22.996 --> 30:24.630
from <i>Pro League Soccer...</i>

30:24.632 --> 30:27.299
we find those and bring them
back here to you...

30:27.301 --> 30:30.603
then a human being in the
real world will pay us $15?

30:30.605 --> 30:31.637
Yes, ma'am.

30:31.639 --> 30:34.172
Welcome to the exciting world
of loot hunting.

30:34.174 --> 30:35.440
Folks go into games...

30:35.442 --> 30:37.442
they harvest
the most coveted items...

30:37.444 --> 30:39.311
and they sell them
on my website

30:39.313 --> 30:41.346
to the highest bidder.
Ha-ha?

30:41.348 --> 30:43.048
Okay, but here's the thing...

30:43.050 --> 30:45.117
we need like
a buttload of money.

30:45.119 --> 30:47.555
So, do you have any more
lucrative items, maybe?

30:48.188 --> 30:49.189
Gord!

30:50.023 --> 30:51.189
Gord!

30:51.191 --> 30:52.092
Oh, there you are.

30:54.529 --> 30:56.962
Thank you, buddy.
You're such a nice guy.

30:56.964 --> 30:59.364
Is $40,000 lucrative
enough for you?

30:59.366 --> 31:00.466
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

31:00.468 --> 31:02.134
It's more than enough.

31:02.136 --> 31:04.069
I got a guy
in Des Moines, Iowa...

31:04.071 --> 31:06.972
who will pay 40 grand
for Shank's car...

31:06.974 --> 31:08.674
from a game
called <i>Slaughter Race.</i>

31:08.676 --> 31:10.242
A racing game?

31:10.244 --> 31:12.210
That's right. <i>Slaughter Race</i>
is the most popular

31:12.212 --> 31:14.212
online racing game
out there.

31:14.214 --> 31:16.148
However,
it is wicked dangerous.

31:16.150 --> 31:17.550
We ain't afraid of danger.

31:17.552 --> 31:19.552
This kid's the best racer
in the whole world.

31:19.554 --> 31:22.588
We'll get you that car,
no problemo.

31:22.590 --> 31:26.057
Slaughter Race!
<i>Enter at your own risk.</i>

31:32.500 --> 31:35.470
Okay, this game
is kind of amazing.

31:37.405 --> 31:40.273
Meh, the attention to detail
is pretty impressive.

31:41.376 --> 31:43.376
I don't think
I've ever been in a game

31:43.378 --> 31:44.610
with smog before.

31:46.079 --> 31:48.748
- Nice kitty. Nice kitty.
- Easy, boy. Easy.

31:52.454 --> 31:54.720
Let's just find Shank's car
and get outta here.

31:54.722 --> 31:55.523
Agreed.

32:01.529 --> 32:03.061
- Look. Look.
- Whoa!

32:03.063 --> 32:04.230
There it is.

32:04.232 --> 32:06.265
That car is gorgeous.

32:06.267 --> 32:08.234
No wonder it's worth so much.

32:09.404 --> 32:11.571
Aw, sugar.

32:11.573 --> 32:14.207
- Players. They beat us to it.
- Aw.

32:14.209 --> 32:16.375
<i>31 hours
of continuous gameplay...</i>

32:16.377 --> 32:19.111
<i>and we've finally
found Shank's car.</i>

32:19.113 --> 32:21.047
Let's jack this ride.

32:21.049 --> 32:23.249
Oh, yeah, DirtySocks,
it's on.

32:23.251 --> 32:25.251
Jim! Jimmy?

32:25.253 --> 32:28.154
You're not playing that
horrible game again, are you?

32:28.156 --> 32:29.388
No, Grandma!

32:29.390 --> 32:30.723
I'm doing my homework.

32:30.725 --> 32:32.258
Okay, like I said...

32:32.260 --> 32:33.695
<i>Let's jack this ride.</i>

32:40.134 --> 32:41.569
Well, well, well.

32:42.770 --> 32:46.574
While the cat was away,
these mice tried to play.

32:50.144 --> 32:52.278
Hey, I think
that might be Shank.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.779
Listen up, mice...

32:53.781 --> 32:56.849
anyone who tries to play
with this cat's ride

32:56.851 --> 32:58.351
is gonna get got.

32:58.353 --> 33:01.354
<i>You're going down, Shank.</i>

33:01.356 --> 33:03.756
Pyro. Give those punks
the works.

33:03.758 --> 33:05.260
With pleasure.

33:08.296 --> 33:10.463
<i>End of the road!</i>

33:10.465 --> 33:12.634
Gosh dang it!
Now we gotta start all over.

33:13.635 --> 33:15.201
Ralph, maybe...

33:15.203 --> 33:17.136
Hey, where are you going?

33:17.138 --> 33:19.305
I am scared.

33:19.307 --> 33:20.473
If we get burned up
in here,

33:20.475 --> 33:21.774
that's it, we're dead,
we're gone.

33:21.776 --> 33:23.476
So, I think we should
get outta here right now.

33:23.478 --> 33:26.312
No, wait, wait.
I have an idea.

33:28.483 --> 33:29.816
Hey, Shank?

33:29.818 --> 33:31.384
What's up, Pyro?

33:31.386 --> 33:33.686
Um, do you ever reckon
we're going a bit too hard

33:33.688 --> 33:35.221
on the players?

33:35.223 --> 33:38.257
Honestly, no, I don't.

33:38.259 --> 33:42.261
Of course, I have empathy for
players like DirtySocks537

33:42.263 --> 33:44.265
and BabeRaham_Linkin...

33:44.900 --> 33:46.365
but if we just let them win,

33:46.367 --> 33:48.668
where's the life lesson?
You know?

33:48.670 --> 33:52.171
- Mmm.
- Yeah, but to Pyro's point...

33:52.173 --> 33:54.607
I mean, those players
work so hard to get here.

33:54.609 --> 33:56.375
I hear you, Felony...

33:56.377 --> 33:58.544
but imagine a game
without challenges.

33:58.546 --> 34:01.514
The same predictable thing
every single time...

34:01.516 --> 34:02.716
who wants that?

34:02.718 --> 34:03.750
Shank's right.

34:03.752 --> 34:06.820
I just saw a really
insightful TED talk...

34:06.822 --> 34:08.855
and I can't really remember
what the guy said.

34:08.857 --> 34:10.891
It was more about
how he made me feel.

34:10.893 --> 34:13.391
But I think, ultimately,
the point was...

34:13.393 --> 34:16.562
I honor your journeys, guys.

34:16.563 --> 34:18.632
And we honor yours,
Butcher Boy.

34:18.634 --> 34:19.766
Thank you.

34:19.768 --> 34:20.766
Hey, Shank,

34:20.768 --> 34:22.569
did you ever wonder
what it would be like...

34:22.571 --> 34:24.437
if someone actually
did get your car?

34:24.438 --> 34:25.906
Well, I know one thing...

34:25.908 --> 34:28.507
whoever does will have to
be the best of the best.

34:32.246 --> 34:34.179
Good day to you, madam.

34:34.181 --> 34:35.380
Who are you?

34:35.382 --> 34:38.784
I'm here from the, uh,
Department of Noise.

34:38.786 --> 34:40.887
And the thing is, we've been
getting some complaints

34:40.889 --> 34:42.556
down at HQ.

34:42.558 --> 34:44.491
Uh, Larry's the one
who takes the calls.

34:44.493 --> 34:45.859
Anyways, someone told Larry...

34:45.860 --> 34:47.193
that we've been
hearing a lot of

34:47.195 --> 34:48.594
gun sounds
and screaming sounds...

34:48.597 --> 34:50.563
and what-have-you.
That sort of thing.

34:50.565 --> 34:53.869
Whoa! This is nice.

34:55.402 --> 34:58.304
Where have you been
all my life?

34:58.306 --> 35:00.406
Uh, so I came to
check on things.

35:00.408 --> 35:01.975
Oh, I'm sorry, who did
you say you were again?

35:01.977 --> 35:04.444
Oh, I'm Larry?

35:04.446 --> 35:06.379
Uh, you said
Larry took the call.

35:13.756 --> 35:15.722
Good job, Larry!

35:15.724 --> 35:18.226
Yeah, worked like a charm!

35:24.333 --> 35:26.433
<i>Are you kidding me?
Someone got Shank's car?</i>

35:26.435 --> 35:28.303
And I need yours. Sorry.

35:30.506 --> 35:32.608
<i>I'm just...
I'm just gonna go.</i>

35:35.477 --> 35:37.479
This is the worst day
of my life!

35:38.681 --> 35:40.447
It's a shame
we have to leave so soon.

35:40.449 --> 35:41.982
This game is cool.

35:41.984 --> 35:43.016
Just get us out of here

35:43.018 --> 35:45.285
so we can get this car
to Spamley and get paid.

35:45.287 --> 35:46.520
No problem.

35:48.724 --> 35:49.890
Uh-oh.

35:49.892 --> 35:51.760
Look at this guy
coming in hot.

36:08.377 --> 36:10.779
You mess with the bull, you
get the horns, little girl!

36:15.417 --> 36:16.952
You still have value,
Butcher Boy.

36:20.556 --> 36:22.689
Oh, no!
It's that Shank lady.

36:22.691 --> 36:23.990
She looks upset.

36:23.992 --> 36:26.293
Ah, don't worry,
I'll lose her.

36:34.837 --> 36:36.470
Where are you going?

36:36.472 --> 36:38.972
Kid, get back on the track.
I'm gonna lose my cookies.

36:38.974 --> 36:41.310
There is no track.
I can drive anywhere.

36:41.910 --> 36:42.978
Whoo!

36:56.325 --> 36:58.993
Oh, kid, she's coming up
right behind us.

36:58.995 --> 37:00.360
Oh, hello!

37:00.362 --> 37:02.362
I believe you have
something of mine.

37:02.364 --> 37:03.766
Yeah, come and get it.

37:14.810 --> 37:16.946
Ooh!

37:18.747 --> 37:20.816
This girl can drive.

37:31.727 --> 37:33.127
Would you hurry up
and lose her?

37:33.129 --> 37:34.030
I'm trying!

37:35.832 --> 37:37.932
Hang on, chumbo!

37:44.107 --> 37:45.842
I don't like this!

37:57.720 --> 38:00.721
Whoa! Mother Hubbard,
this lady can really drive.

38:00.723 --> 38:02.589
Kid, fire!
Do you see the fire?

38:02.591 --> 38:03.758
Dead end! Dead end!

38:03.760 --> 38:06.426
Not for me. Bye-bye, Shanky.

38:07.797 --> 38:09.063
Whoo-hoo!

38:09.065 --> 38:10.832
- Oh, yeah!
- That's the stuff.

38:10.834 --> 38:11.933
Good job, kid.

38:11.935 --> 38:14.769
Oh, yeah,
I feel like me again.

38:14.771 --> 38:16.773
One exit straight ahead.

38:35.524 --> 38:36.624
You're not gonna lose me
that easy.

38:36.626 --> 38:37.925
How did you...?

38:37.927 --> 38:39.459
Uh, you might wanna keep
your eyes on the road.

38:39.461 --> 38:40.728
Kid!

38:48.004 --> 38:51.672
Yo, Department of Noise,
get out of my car!

38:51.674 --> 38:53.107
Oh, man,
what are we gonna do?

38:53.109 --> 38:55.009
You just stay put,
don't panic.

38:55.011 --> 38:56.177
I'm gonna talk to her.

38:56.179 --> 38:57.712
Ralph, be careful.

38:57.714 --> 39:00.781
It's fine.
This is what heroes do.

39:03.486 --> 39:04.954
My bottom is stuck.

39:07.891 --> 39:10.625
This car is not designed
for a big boy.

39:10.627 --> 39:12.493
I'll tell you that. Hi.

39:12.495 --> 39:14.996
You guys really thought
you could just steal my car?

39:14.998 --> 39:17.531
Well, let me tell you
what's gonna happen now.

39:17.533 --> 39:20.134
No, wait, listen. We aren't
normally car thieves.

39:20.136 --> 39:23.638
My friend here,
she's a candy kart racer.

39:23.640 --> 39:24.639
You should see her
racing around

39:24.641 --> 39:26.474
her sweet little track...

39:26.476 --> 39:27.942
in her cookie wafer car
we built together.

39:29.112 --> 39:33.781
And, well, the thing is, her
perfect little game broke...

39:33.783 --> 39:35.783
and it was my fault...

39:35.785 --> 39:37.952
so we're here
to try to fix it...

39:37.954 --> 39:39.120
and we need money to do that,

39:39.122 --> 39:40.855
and someone was
gonna pay us money...

39:40.857 --> 39:42.556
- to steal your car...
- Okay, okay.

39:42.558 --> 39:44.592
- ...and so we took it.
- You can stop crying.

39:44.594 --> 39:45.860
Though I do respect

39:45.862 --> 39:47.561
your wonderful display
of vulnerability.

39:47.563 --> 39:49.264
Thank you.

39:49.266 --> 39:51.165
I get it, I do.

39:51.167 --> 39:53.701
Friendship is
everything to us, too.

39:53.703 --> 39:56.037
- Right, guys?
- Word. We're like family.

39:56.039 --> 39:57.872
That's really great.

39:57.874 --> 39:59.874
So, does this mean
we can keep your car?

39:59.876 --> 40:02.877
Absolutely not.
But I do want to help.

40:02.879 --> 40:04.045
Hey, you got
your phone on you?

40:04.047 --> 40:06.180
- You know it.
- Let's make a video.

40:06.182 --> 40:08.283
Pyro, hit big boy
with the blow and go.

40:08.285 --> 40:09.550
I'd love to.

40:09.552 --> 40:10.851
Wait. What's the...?

40:11.921 --> 40:13.654
What are you doing?

40:13.656 --> 40:15.858
Say something, first thing
that comes to your mind.

40:16.592 --> 40:19.194
I'm gonna wreck it!

40:19.196 --> 40:21.296
Good. All right.
Turn it off.

40:21.298 --> 40:23.965
Ow.

40:23.967 --> 40:25.200
What the heck
did you do that for?

40:25.202 --> 40:26.401
Yeah.

40:26.403 --> 40:29.237
There are much better ways
to make money on the Internet

40:29.239 --> 40:30.938
than stealing cars...

40:30.940 --> 40:34.109
such as becoming
a BuzzzTube star.

40:34.111 --> 40:35.943
Am I supposed to know
what that is?

40:35.945 --> 40:38.180
Oh, come on.
Everybody knows BuzzzTube.

40:38.182 --> 40:40.115
It's the video-sharing site.

40:40.117 --> 40:41.816
I'm just starting
your account...

40:41.818 --> 40:44.152
All right, there you go.

40:44.154 --> 40:47.922
If this thing goes viral,
you can make a lot of money.

40:47.924 --> 40:50.025
A friend of mine,
chick named Yesss...

40:50.027 --> 40:51.926
she's the head algorithm
over there.

40:51.928 --> 40:53.295
Tell her I sent you.

40:53.297 --> 40:54.762
Yesss will hook you up.

40:54.764 --> 40:56.964
Wow, that's really nice
of you.

40:56.966 --> 40:58.933
I'm not sure if "nice"
is the right word.

40:58.935 --> 41:00.835
Well, thank you.

41:00.837 --> 41:02.204
I should be thanking you,
little sister.

41:02.206 --> 41:03.771
That race was fun.

41:03.773 --> 41:05.606
Oh.

41:05.608 --> 41:06.210
Well, thank you again.

41:07.044 --> 41:08.076
Uh... You know...

41:08.078 --> 41:10.979
While we're talking shop,
what move did you do

41:10.981 --> 41:12.913
to get through
that tunnel of fire?

41:12.915 --> 41:15.616
Was it a power drift into
a drift jump, maybe, or...?

41:15.618 --> 41:17.152
Maybe.

41:17.154 --> 41:19.254
If you ever wanna come back
for a rematch...

41:19.256 --> 41:21.156
I'd be happy
to kick your butt again.

41:21.158 --> 41:22.357
See you.

41:36.806 --> 41:37.906
Whoa.

41:37.908 --> 41:39.109
Show-off.

41:40.277 --> 41:42.844
Man, oh, man,
that place was scary.

41:42.846 --> 41:45.013
I know.
It was so exciting!

41:45.015 --> 41:46.915
No, exciting is
when you smile.

41:46.917 --> 41:48.649
Scary is when
you clench your butt,

41:48.651 --> 41:50.285
and my butt
is still clenched.

41:50.287 --> 41:52.320
Oh, come on, are you
honestly telling me...

41:52.322 --> 41:55.656
that Shank lady wasn't the
coolest person you ever met?

41:55.658 --> 41:58.160
Cool? Name one cool thing
about her.

41:58.162 --> 42:00.661
Um, let's see, she looks
cool, she talks cool...

42:00.663 --> 42:02.831
she drives cool, her hair
is cool, her car is cool...

42:02.833 --> 42:05.000
Wait a minute, are you
saying my hair isn't cool?

42:05.002 --> 42:09.237
What? No! I'm just saying
the game was next-level.

42:09.239 --> 42:11.840
There was no one telling you
what to do or where to go.

42:11.842 --> 42:14.176
Hey, just where do you think
you're going?

42:14.178 --> 42:16.078
To BuzzzTube.
It's this way.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.346
No, no, no. We're going
back to Spamley's.

42:18.348 --> 42:20.348
He can give us
some easier loot to find.

42:20.350 --> 42:23.185
No, we're supposed to
see Shank's friend.

42:23.187 --> 42:25.754
Oh, come on. I don't trust
that Shank one bit.

42:25.756 --> 42:27.956
- Well, I do.
- Well, I...

42:27.958 --> 42:29.891
- Hello, mister.
- Who are you?

42:29.893 --> 42:31.793
I'm your friendly
ebay alert messenger.

42:31.795 --> 42:34.029
Huh. An actual eboy.

42:34.031 --> 42:37.399
Just here to let you know your
bid expires in eight hours.

42:37.401 --> 42:40.702
Eight hours.
Okay, thanks, eboy.

42:40.704 --> 42:42.337
You got it, Jackson!

42:42.339 --> 42:46.241
Chumbo, if we nickel-and-dime
it with Spamley...

42:46.243 --> 42:48.076
it will take 20 years

42:48.078 --> 42:49.845
to make enough money
to buy the wheel.

42:49.847 --> 42:52.914
All right, fine.
We'll do it your way.

42:52.916 --> 42:54.749
But I'm telling you right now,
that BuzzzTube place

42:54.751 --> 42:56.053
is a terrible idea.

43:03.427 --> 43:06.895
Man, there are all kinds of
videos in here.

43:06.897 --> 43:09.364
Yeah, if you like
babies and cats.

43:09.366 --> 43:11.233
- Look, there's you!
- Oh, yeah.

43:11.235 --> 43:12.734
<i>I'm gonna wreck it!</i>

43:15.706 --> 43:17.105
I wonder
why those little guys

43:17.107 --> 43:18.874
are giving your video
all those hearts?

43:18.876 --> 43:20.108
Because obviously
they love me.

43:20.110 --> 43:22.344
I told you this place
was a good idea.

43:22.346 --> 43:24.212
Yeah,
sure you did, doof.

43:24.214 --> 43:26.781
Now, who we supposed to see
about getting paid again?

43:26.783 --> 43:30.085
The head algorithm.
Her name is Yesss.

43:30.087 --> 43:32.122
No. No. No.

43:32.756 --> 43:35.391
Uninspired, cliched...

43:35.393 --> 43:37.292
Ugh! YouTube's got this one.

43:37.294 --> 43:39.995
Chewbacca Dad? Really?

43:39.997 --> 43:43.231
Yeah, it's like Chewbacca Mom,
but it's a daddy.

43:43.233 --> 43:44.766
No!

43:44.768 --> 43:47.869
Heyo! Are you
the head of Al Gore?

43:47.871 --> 43:51.773
I am the head algorithm
of BuzzzTube...

43:51.775 --> 43:53.476
which means
I curate the content...

43:53.478 --> 43:56.345
at the Internet's most
popular video-sharing site.

43:56.347 --> 43:58.113
Which means, I don't
have time to trifle...

43:58.115 --> 44:00.749
with every shoeless,
mouth-breathing hobo

44:00.751 --> 44:02.017
that trundles
into my office.

44:02.019 --> 44:03.419
Call security, Maybe.

44:03.421 --> 44:07.122
Yes. But, Yesss,
this is the leaf blower guy.

44:07.124 --> 44:08.291
Who?

44:08.293 --> 44:09.925
The man
with the undulating jowls.

44:09.927 --> 44:11.327
So?

44:11.329 --> 44:13.795
His video has
1.3 million hearts.

44:13.797 --> 44:15.464
Well!

44:15.466 --> 44:17.999
Why didn't you tell me

44:18.001 --> 44:19.968
I was in the presence
of a genius?

44:19.970 --> 44:21.404
Grab him a drink.

44:21.406 --> 44:23.004
Yeah, this lady
named Shank...

44:23.006 --> 44:24.307
she actually made the video.

44:24.309 --> 44:26.475
She's the one who told us
to come see you.

44:26.477 --> 44:28.810
No wonder
your video's so dope.

44:28.812 --> 44:30.446
Shank is for real cool.

44:30.448 --> 44:31.813
Right?

44:31.815 --> 44:33.182
She is not.

44:33.184 --> 44:35.151
I'm the cool one
getting all the hearts.

44:35.153 --> 44:38.154
Well, that's right,
you big baby.

44:39.022 --> 44:40.189
Yeah.

44:40.191 --> 44:41.357
Um, what'd you say
your name was?

44:41.359 --> 44:43.024
Ralph, Wreck-It Ralph.

44:43.026 --> 44:46.295
Well, Wreck-It Ralph,
you are trending!

44:46.297 --> 44:50.299
And these are for you. Hearts,
hearts, hearts, hearts.

44:50.301 --> 44:51.900
- Hearts, hearts, hearts!
- Hearts, hearts, hearts!

44:51.902 --> 44:53.034
Yes! Hearts!

44:56.207 --> 44:58.040
Uh, not to buzzkill
the lovefest

44:58.042 --> 44:59.808
you guys got going on here...

44:59.810 --> 45:01.377
but Shank kinda
told us that

45:01.379 --> 45:04.846
viral videos can make,
like, actual money?

45:04.848 --> 45:06.915
Oh, hearts are money, honey.

45:06.917 --> 45:09.118
Your Buzzzy account converts
hearts into dollars.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.486
Ka-ching!

45:10.488 --> 45:12.321
$43,000!

45:12.323 --> 45:15.291
Kid, we only needed $27,001.
We're done.

45:15.293 --> 45:18.227
Oh, no, no, no.

45:18.229 --> 45:20.196
That's $43.

45:20.198 --> 45:24.233
43? That's not even
half of 27,001.

45:24.235 --> 45:27.536
And we only have eight
hours left to save my game.

45:27.538 --> 45:30.473
Ugh. Well, I hate to say it,
but that ain't happening.

45:30.475 --> 45:32.174
Your video is tapped out.

45:32.176 --> 45:33.609
But I thought
I was trenching?

45:33.611 --> 45:35.144
Trending.

45:35.146 --> 45:37.313
You were.
But that was 15 seconds ago.

45:37.315 --> 45:39.282
Now, you're not.

45:39.284 --> 45:40.084
Thanks for stopping by,
though.

45:41.552 --> 45:43.152
Aw!

45:43.154 --> 45:44.387
What are we gonna do, kid?

45:44.389 --> 45:47.323
All right, pal, I have
an idea. And hear me out.

45:47.325 --> 45:50.559
What if we go back
to <i>Slaughter Race</i>

45:50.561 --> 45:51.761
and I ask Shank really...

45:51.763 --> 45:56.098
No, no, no. We're not going
back to that death trap.

45:56.100 --> 45:58.334
Yesss, what if I made you
a whole bunch of videos...

45:58.336 --> 46:00.970
of me doing all kinds of them
crazy things?

46:00.972 --> 46:02.605
You mean
saturate the market?

46:02.607 --> 46:05.107
That could get you
a lot of hearts fast.

46:05.109 --> 46:06.342
Have you thought
this through at all?

46:06.344 --> 46:09.145
What do you plan on even doing
in these videos?

46:09.147 --> 46:11.447
I'll just copy
whatever's popular.

46:11.449 --> 46:14.050
Genius. Yo, Maybe,
what's trending right now?

46:14.052 --> 46:16.252
Mmm-hmm. Let's have
a lookie-lookie.

46:16.254 --> 46:18.321
As usual, human suffering
is number one...

46:18.323 --> 46:20.022
followed by hot pepper

46:20.024 --> 46:21.290
eating challenges...

46:21.292 --> 46:22.992
video game walkthroughs...

46:22.994 --> 46:24.427
oh, screaming goats
are back...

46:24.429 --> 46:27.530
unboxings, cooking demos,
makeup tutorials...

46:27.532 --> 46:30.533
and lastly, ugh, bee puns.

46:30.535 --> 46:33.071
<i>Let's "bee" friends.</i>

46:35.039 --> 46:36.405
Two weeks in a row, guys.

46:36.407 --> 46:38.407
That's a fortnight
of bee puns.

46:38.409 --> 46:41.243
He won't be doing any bee puns.
They're beneath you.

46:41.245 --> 46:44.013
Oh, I'm doing a bee pun.
Oh, yes, I am.

46:44.015 --> 46:46.982
And I'm eating a hot pepper,
and I'm putting on makeup...

46:46.984 --> 46:48.417
and whatever else it takes!

46:48.419 --> 46:51.120
Because, kid, we came here
to save your game

46:51.122 --> 46:52.421
and we're gonna do it.

46:52.423 --> 46:54.290
I love it! Ha!

46:54.292 --> 46:56.092
That is what the Internet
was made for!

46:56.094 --> 46:57.528
Now, let's get to work.

47:00.098 --> 47:01.565
Seen it.

47:01.567 --> 47:03.399
Saw that one.

47:03.401 --> 47:05.436
Seen it. Seen it.

47:06.471 --> 47:07.704
Huh?

47:15.681 --> 47:18.180
Yo, McNeely,
you remember Wreck-It Ralph?

47:18.182 --> 47:19.649
That bad guy
from the old video game?

47:19.651 --> 47:21.685
Yeah, exactly.

47:21.687 --> 47:22.985
I'm gonna send you
a super random video.

47:22.987 --> 47:24.286
Check it out, dude.

47:24.288 --> 47:25.591
Yeah, I'll give it a heart.
Whatever.

47:36.635 --> 47:38.635
Hey, everybody, welcome to
<i>Up To the Meme-ent!</i>

47:38.637 --> 47:40.169
I'm your host,
Dani Fernandez.

47:40.171 --> 47:41.671
Nobody knows
who's making them,

47:41.673 --> 47:43.440
but the whole world
is going bonkers...

47:43.442 --> 47:46.142
over a series
of truly bizarre videos...

47:46.144 --> 47:48.545
starring '80s-era bad guy
Wreck-It Ralph.

47:48.547 --> 47:50.480
Check out what
everyone is buzzing about...

47:50.482 --> 47:52.014
<i>over at BuzzzTube.com.</i>

47:52.016 --> 47:53.650
<i>Hey, guys,
Wreck-It Ralph here...</i>

47:53.652 --> 47:56.252
<i>with the ghost pepper
challenge.</i>

47:56.254 --> 47:57.955
<i>Supposed to be spicy.
We'll see about that.</i>

47:58.657 --> 48:00.222
<i>Mmm. That's not so...</i>

48:00.224 --> 48:02.492
<i>Oh, it's very hot!
Oh, make it stop!</i>

48:02.494 --> 48:04.294
Yo, McNeely,
another one just dropped.

48:04.296 --> 48:05.429
Check it out, dude.

48:05.431 --> 48:07.397
Where are these things
coming from?

48:07.399 --> 48:08.532
Hey, Josey,

48:08.534 --> 48:09.633
did you see
the pepper challenge?

48:09.635 --> 48:10.734
Oh, not yet.

48:10.736 --> 48:13.202
I'm watching the one
where he just smacks his lips.

48:13.204 --> 48:14.571
It's disgusting.

48:14.573 --> 48:16.038
<i>You don't want
any real hard lines.</i>

48:16.040 --> 48:18.475
<i>You just want to blend that
out there, like this...</i>

48:18.477 --> 48:20.377
<i>And that, my friends,</i>

48:20.379 --> 48:23.213
<i>is how you achieve
the perfect cat eye.</i>

48:23.215 --> 48:24.314
<i>I always start</i>

48:24.316 --> 48:27.717
<i>with the hootnanny.
Shift it into a floss.</i>

48:27.719 --> 48:31.086
<i>And now I finish with
a hot Marat. Huh? Huh?</i>

48:31.088 --> 48:32.622
<i>Follow along with me,</i>

48:32.624 --> 48:36.393
<i>and I'm gonna give this little
cloud a little friend...</i>

48:36.395 --> 48:38.161
<i>in the form of a tree.</i>

48:38.163 --> 48:39.465
<i>Everybody needs a friend.</i>

48:41.200 --> 48:42.599
<i>Look at these guys.</i>

48:42.601 --> 48:44.568
<i>Look at this one,
sleeping under his ear.</i>

48:44.570 --> 48:46.770
<i>You couch potatoes.
Wake up.</i>

48:46.772 --> 48:49.739
<i>We've been baking
at about 950 degrees</i>

48:49.741 --> 48:51.241
<i>now for six hours...</i>

48:51.243 --> 48:52.742
<i>so she should be ready.</i>

48:54.112 --> 48:57.113
<i>Voila! Burnt pie!</i>

48:57.115 --> 48:58.582
<i>Let's have a little whiff</i>
<i>of this here.</i>

48:58.584 --> 49:00.452
<i>My hair,</i>
<i>my hair! My hair!</i>

49:01.286 --> 49:03.320
This man is on fire.

49:03.322 --> 49:05.422
Literal and figurative fire.

49:05.424 --> 49:07.290
But he still needs
200 million hearts

49:07.292 --> 49:08.725
in the next five hours...

49:08.727 --> 49:10.727
or this beautiful child
loses her game.

49:10.729 --> 49:13.230
That's why
I'm on to phase two...

49:13.232 --> 49:15.732
you, my elite Pop-Up Army.

49:15.734 --> 49:17.834
I need you out there
popping up...

49:17.836 --> 49:20.337
and getting clicks
all over the Internet.

49:20.339 --> 49:23.240
I'm talking Tumblr,
Instagram, Mashable.

49:23.242 --> 49:24.641
Be my pied pipers and

49:24.643 --> 49:27.310
lead that beautiful traffic
to BuzzzTube...

49:27.312 --> 49:29.548
because Wreck-It Ralph
needs his hearts.

49:33.819 --> 49:36.152
Hey, mister! Hey, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, you, you.

49:36.154 --> 49:37.621
You don't wanna miss this.

49:37.623 --> 49:38.655
It's the latest
Wreck-It Ralph video.

49:38.657 --> 49:40.225
Click it. Click it!

49:52.571 --> 49:55.605
Man oh Manischewitz,
that looks so fun.

49:55.607 --> 49:56.841
Yesss, can I be a pop-up?

49:56.843 --> 49:59.476
I don't know. Can you be
annoyingly aggressive?

49:59.478 --> 50:02.312
I don't know.
Can I? Can I? Can I?

50:02.314 --> 50:04.516
Can I? Can I? Can I?
Can I? Can I? Can I?

50:05.584 --> 50:07.684
Oh, yes, you're perfect. Here.

50:07.686 --> 50:09.286
Thank you!

50:09.288 --> 50:10.420
If you're going, I wanna go.

50:10.422 --> 50:13.858
No, baby, you've got to stay
here and be my movie star.

50:13.860 --> 50:17.160
What? No, no, no. Me and the
kid are like shoes and socks.

50:17.162 --> 50:18.528
Or peanut butter and bacon.

50:18.530 --> 50:20.330
One cannot exist
without the other.

50:20.332 --> 50:21.598
Go on, kid, tell her.

50:21.600 --> 50:22.566
It's true.

50:22.568 --> 50:26.136
In fact, it's so true
that we will be fine

50:26.138 --> 50:28.204
if we're apart
for a minute.

50:28.206 --> 50:30.708
Come on, pal. It's my game
we're trying to save.

50:30.710 --> 50:32.311
I just wanna get out there
and be useful.

50:33.145 --> 50:34.344
But without me?

50:34.346 --> 50:36.379
What if you get lost?
You're just a kid.

50:36.381 --> 50:38.548
Oh, and you're
some mature adult?

50:38.550 --> 50:40.550
Well, I'm bigger.

50:40.552 --> 50:42.485
Don't be insecure,
big fella.

50:42.487 --> 50:44.789
She's not gonna get lost.
I promise.

50:44.791 --> 50:47.559
She'll be in
my personal web browser.

50:48.861 --> 50:51.194
And your app comes
with BuzzzFace...

50:51.196 --> 50:53.396
so you can keep in touch
anywhere on the Internet.

50:53.398 --> 50:55.231
See, I'll be fine.

50:55.233 --> 50:57.135
I know, I just...

51:00.907 --> 51:03.774
We haven't been apart
in like six years.

51:03.776 --> 51:05.678
I'm going to miss you.

51:06.311 --> 51:08.579
You'll be fine, too.

51:08.581 --> 51:10.347
The more hearts
your videos get,

51:10.349 --> 51:12.315
the faster
we'll get the wheel.

51:12.317 --> 51:13.918
And then we can go home.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.452
Look, we'll be celebrating

51:15.454 --> 51:17.688
at Tapper's this time
tomorrow, buddy.

51:17.690 --> 51:20.593
Yeah, I guess you're right.

51:21.226 --> 51:22.860
Bye!

51:22.862 --> 51:25.696
Be careful, huh?
Don't be a dummy.

51:29.602 --> 51:31.602
So where exactly
are you sending her?

51:31.604 --> 51:33.871
Since candy girl
comes from an arcade game...

51:33.873 --> 51:35.541
I'm thinking she'd be good
in the gaming district.

51:37.309 --> 51:38.943
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Bad idea.

51:38.945 --> 51:41.579
Those games are dangerous,
and they rot your brain.

51:41.581 --> 51:42.880
Why don't we
send her somewhere

51:42.882 --> 51:45.549
a little more totally
different than that...

51:45.551 --> 51:47.952
and nowhere near there?

51:47.954 --> 51:51.221
Let's see.
Family Friendly Fansites.

51:51.223 --> 51:53.457
That sounds safe, and she is
technically a princess...

51:53.459 --> 51:55.493
so how about this one here

51:55.495 --> 51:56.927
with the sweet little
pink castle?

51:56.929 --> 51:58.095
I love it.

51:58.097 --> 52:02.001
Okay, I'll redirect our newest
pop-up to OhMyDisney.com.

52:07.774 --> 52:10.943
Jeez Louise, this place
is bonkers! Whoa!

52:16.248 --> 52:18.685
To infinity and beyond!

52:22.255 --> 52:25.489
Aw, come on. Princesses
and cartoon characters?

52:25.491 --> 52:26.957
Lame.

52:26.959 --> 52:29.660
Hey, easy there.

52:29.662 --> 52:31.864
Oh, I mean,
no offense or anything.

52:32.799 --> 52:34.965
Well, time to get to work.

52:34.967 --> 52:36.500
And for your final question.

52:36.502 --> 52:39.570
"My friends
would describe me as?"

52:39.572 --> 52:42.673
<i>"Smart, funny,
kind, or brave."</i>

52:42.675 --> 52:43.676
<i>Um...</i>

52:44.510 --> 52:46.777
Kind, I guess?

52:46.779 --> 52:50.815
Based on your answers,
your princess BFF is

52:50.817 --> 52:52.616
Snow White!

52:52.618 --> 52:54.018
I do believe our friendship

52:54.020 --> 52:56.020
will be the fairest
of them all!

52:56.022 --> 52:59.356
Hey, wanna meet my BFF?
It's Wreck-It Ralph.

52:59.358 --> 53:01.358
Just click here
to see his new video.

53:02.495 --> 53:04.295
Thank you.

53:04.297 --> 53:06.931
<i>Yeah, um, in</i> Captain America:
The First Avenger...

53:06.933 --> 53:08.833
<i>Red Skull refers to Yggdrasil,</i>

53:08.835 --> 53:11.001
<i>the World Tree,
Guardian of Wisdom and Fate.</i>

53:11.003 --> 53:12.870
<i>Are we to believe, sir,</i>

53:12.872 --> 53:14.474
<i>that you are a descendant
of that tree?</i>

53:15.441 --> 53:17.341
I am Groot.

53:17.343 --> 53:19.376
<i>Okay, okay.
Thank you very much.</i>

53:19.378 --> 53:21.545
<i>Um, what is Drax really like?</i>

53:21.547 --> 53:23.048
- I am Groot.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

53:23.050 --> 53:26.383
<i>Yeah. Are you a conifer
or a fruit-bearing tree?</i>

53:26.385 --> 53:27.451
- I...
- Excuse me.

53:27.453 --> 53:28.519
I'll take this one.
He is Groot,

53:28.521 --> 53:29.620
I am Vanellope,

53:29.622 --> 53:30.923
click here
to meet Wreck-It Ralph.

53:32.358 --> 53:35.526
Eh, this is almost too easy.

53:35.528 --> 53:36.927
<i>Hey, do you
have a permit for that pop-up?</i>

53:36.929 --> 53:38.362
Uh...

53:38.364 --> 53:40.865
<i>That's unauthorized clickbait.
You're coming with us, kid.</i>

53:40.867 --> 53:42.733
Boop!

53:42.735 --> 53:43.870
<i>She's getting away.</i>

53:46.539 --> 53:47.540
<i>This way.</i>

53:47.975 --> 53:49.107
Ooh!

53:49.109 --> 53:50.309
Sorry, mister!

53:53.679 --> 53:56.882
Hey, can't you read?
Cast members only!

53:58.886 --> 54:00.351
<i>I think she
went down this way. Come on.</i>

54:00.353 --> 54:01.685
<i>Roger that.</i>

54:01.687 --> 54:02.820
<i>Did you see
a kid come through here?</i>

54:02.822 --> 54:05.556
She came running through here
like a headless hen.

54:07.693 --> 54:08.592
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

54:08.594 --> 54:10.594
<i>No, maybe she went down</i>

54:10.596 --> 54:11.897
<i>to the</i> Air Bud <i>pavilion.</i>

54:11.899 --> 54:13.499
<i>Come on. Let's check it out.</i>

54:20.773 --> 54:21.907
Uh, hi!

54:25.813 --> 54:27.779
Whoa, whoa.
Ladies, I can explain.

54:27.781 --> 54:30.749
See, I'm a princess, too.

54:30.751 --> 54:32.583
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

54:32.585 --> 54:34.618
Princess Vanellope
Von Schweetz...

54:34.620 --> 54:37.555
of the, uh, <i>Sugar Rush</i>
Von Schweetzes.

54:37.557 --> 54:38.857
I'm sure you've heard of us.

54:38.859 --> 54:41.059
It'd be embarrassing for you
if you haven't.

54:41.962 --> 54:44.528
Huh. What kind of
a princess are you?

54:44.530 --> 54:45.697
What kind?

54:45.699 --> 54:47.531
- Do you have magic hair?
- No.

54:47.533 --> 54:49.134
- Magic hands?
- No.

54:49.136 --> 54:51.402
- Do animals talk to you?
- No.

54:51.404 --> 54:52.536
- Were you poisoned?
- No!

54:52.538 --> 54:53.805
- Cursed?
- No!

54:53.807 --> 54:55.506
- Kidnapped or enslaved?
- No!

54:55.508 --> 54:57.108
Are you guys okay?
Should I call the police?

54:57.110 --> 54:58.643
Then I have to assume
you made a deal

54:58.645 --> 55:00.045
with an underwater
sea witch...

55:00.047 --> 55:00.946
where she took your voice

55:00.948 --> 55:03.447
in exchange
for a pair of human legs?

55:03.449 --> 55:05.817
No! Good Lord,
who would do that?

55:05.819 --> 55:07.418
Have you ever had
True Love's Kiss?

55:07.420 --> 55:08.687
Ew! Barf!

55:08.689 --> 55:09.821
Do you have daddy issues?

55:09.823 --> 55:11.089
I don't even have a mom.

55:11.091 --> 55:12.891
Neither do we!

55:12.893 --> 55:15.426
And now for
the million-dollar question.

55:15.428 --> 55:17.929
Do people assume
all your problems got solved

55:17.931 --> 55:19.831
because a big strong man
showed up?

55:19.833 --> 55:21.967
Yes! What is up with that?

55:21.969 --> 55:23.568
She is a princess!

55:24.972 --> 55:26.671
Who made your gown?

55:26.673 --> 55:28.505
I've never seen
anything quite like it.

55:28.507 --> 55:29.808
Oh, this old thing?

55:29.810 --> 55:31.676
Oh, I'd so love to
have one of my own.

55:31.678 --> 55:32.777
- As would I.
- Me too!

55:32.779 --> 55:34.579
- So cool.
- Best outfit ever!

55:34.581 --> 55:35.747
Ooh! I want one, too,
you guys!

55:35.749 --> 55:37.150
I'll get my mice on this.

55:40.187 --> 55:42.654
So this is love.

55:42.656 --> 55:47.025
All hail Princess Vanellope,
the queen of comfy!

55:47.027 --> 55:48.994
Yay, Vanellope!

55:48.996 --> 55:51.796
Of all the thingamabobs
in this entire world...

55:51.798 --> 55:53.965
I never thought
I'd get to wear a real...

55:53.967 --> 55:55.467
what's it called again?

55:55.469 --> 55:57.903
Oh, yeah. Shirt.

55:57.905 --> 56:01.806
<i>♪ I once had a dream
that I might wear a shirt... ♪</i>

56:01.808 --> 56:04.509
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait! What's going on?

56:04.511 --> 56:06.011
Uh, she's singing.

56:06.013 --> 56:09.180
Yeah, but there was like music
and a spotlight.

56:09.182 --> 56:11.016
Wait, you all
saw it too, right?

56:11.018 --> 56:12.217
That's what happens

56:12.219 --> 56:14.519
when a princess
sings about her dreams.

56:14.521 --> 56:17.822
Oh, that's never happened
to me. I mean, not even once.

56:17.824 --> 56:19.724
Why don't you give it
a try?

56:19.726 --> 56:22.694
What is it you really want?
Sing about that.

56:22.696 --> 56:24.162
Okay. Uh, sure.

56:24.164 --> 56:25.899
Huh. I could do that.
Um, let's see.

56:28.068 --> 56:32.704
<i>♪ Oh, steering wheel
Oh, steering wheel</i>

56:32.706 --> 56:36.141
<i>♪ Oh, yes
I want a steering wheel ♪</i>

56:39.680 --> 56:41.513
Well, there is a lot
to unpack here.

56:41.515 --> 56:42.847
Mmm-hmm.

56:42.849 --> 56:45.183
So, this steering wheel
you sing of,

56:45.185 --> 56:46.785
that's a metaphor?

56:46.787 --> 56:48.987
Oh, no, no, no, it's not
a metaphor. I just...

56:48.989 --> 56:51.589
I literally want
a steering wheel.

56:51.591 --> 56:53.792
I think the issue is
I was a little pitchy.

56:53.794 --> 56:55.227
Maybe a little.

56:55.229 --> 56:58.630
But sometimes
your song can't start...

56:58.632 --> 57:00.767
until you go someplace
to reflect.

57:01.768 --> 57:03.235
What works for some of us...

57:03.237 --> 57:06.840
is finding a form of water
and staring at it.

57:07.541 --> 57:08.873
What?

57:08.875 --> 57:11.210
Oh, yes, I like to stare
at a wishing well!

57:11.212 --> 57:12.610
I stare at the ocean.

57:12.612 --> 57:13.778
Horse trough.

57:13.780 --> 57:14.913
Soap bubbles!

57:14.915 --> 57:17.617
Wait, you're saying if I just
stare at some water...

57:18.286 --> 57:20.086
Uh, important water.

57:20.088 --> 57:22.921
Right. Of course.
"Important water."

57:22.923 --> 57:25.257
I stare at
the important water...

57:25.259 --> 57:28.593
and somehow magically I'll
start singing about my dream?

57:28.595 --> 57:29.661
- For sure.
- Mmm-hmm.

57:29.663 --> 57:32.264
Uh, yeah, I don't think so,
ladies, but thanks.

57:33.800 --> 57:35.667
Five minutes,
Princesses.

57:35.669 --> 57:38.270
Another "Which Disney Princess
Are You?" quizlet

57:38.272 --> 57:39.971
starts in five minutes.

57:39.973 --> 57:42.274
Okay, thank you.

57:42.276 --> 57:45.311
Well, I guess it's back
to the gowns, girls.

57:45.313 --> 57:47.579
It was lovely to meet you,
Vanellope.

57:47.581 --> 57:49.714
And best of luck
finding your song.

57:56.257 --> 57:57.990
Uh-huh.

57:57.992 --> 57:59.291
What did she just say?

57:59.293 --> 58:01.227
We don't know.
We can't understand her.

58:01.229 --> 58:02.928
She's from
the other studio.

58:02.930 --> 58:04.662
Ah.

58:04.664 --> 58:06.865
Hi, everybody.
Wreck-It Ralph here...

58:06.867 --> 58:09.601
with a little box
I'm gonna open.

58:09.603 --> 58:11.070
Let's see what we got here.

58:11.072 --> 58:14.373
A "Pancake Milkshake
Fun Set." Huh.

58:14.375 --> 58:15.875
Got a little heft to it.

58:15.877 --> 58:17.675
Something wobbling
around in there.

58:17.677 --> 58:19.145
Wonder if we got
the kitty or the bunny.

58:19.147 --> 58:20.279
Let's open it up.

58:24.718 --> 58:26.018
Man, who would've
guessed a bee pun

58:26.020 --> 58:28.287
would be the thing
to put us over the top?

58:28.289 --> 58:30.089
Huh. That's the Internet
for you.

58:30.091 --> 58:33.092
All right, it is uploading.

58:33.094 --> 58:34.326
Hey, mister!

58:34.328 --> 58:35.693
Oh. Hi, eboy.

58:35.695 --> 58:36.962
Just here to let you know

58:36.964 --> 58:39.697
your bid does expire
in 30 minutes.

58:39.699 --> 58:41.767
Thanks, little eboy.

58:41.769 --> 58:42.770
You got it, chairman.

58:43.371 --> 58:44.702
You hear that, Yesss?

58:44.704 --> 58:46.172
We don't have
a lot of time left.

58:46.174 --> 58:47.339
Okay. We just gotta...

58:47.341 --> 58:49.674
No, no, no.

58:49.676 --> 58:51.377
No! Not you!

58:51.379 --> 58:53.045
What? Why are you
angry at the lollipop?

58:53.047 --> 58:54.213
What does that mean?

58:54.215 --> 58:55.815
The file's not loading.

58:55.817 --> 58:57.750
If this doesn't load,
we're not gonna make it.

58:57.752 --> 59:00.652
- Hmm.
- You don't have enough hearts.

59:00.654 --> 59:02.021
Ralph, where are you going?

59:02.023 --> 59:03.257
I'm going down to the floor
to get some hearts.

59:04.125 --> 59:05.191
Ah! Genius! Good thinking.

59:05.193 --> 59:07.860
Now, someone get me
tech support in here, stat!

59:11.332 --> 59:13.232
Only one person.

59:13.234 --> 59:14.733
Hey, guys, come and
check out my video,

59:14.735 --> 59:15.668
you're gonna love it.

59:15.670 --> 59:18.704
Right, right over here.
Yep, here we go.

59:18.706 --> 59:20.339
What are you...
You guys!

59:20.341 --> 59:22.241
Aw. A cat?

59:22.243 --> 59:26.147
You're gonna like this better
than some dusty old cat.

59:27.081 --> 59:28.214
Aw.

59:28.216 --> 59:29.348
What?

59:29.350 --> 59:31.317
Give me that hose, partner.

59:31.319 --> 59:34.787
You know you love me, give me those hearts.
There we go.

59:34.789 --> 59:37.389
Hey, folks, where are you going?
Give my video a heart.

59:37.391 --> 59:40.027
That's it.
Let's see who's in here.

59:40.728 --> 59:41.729
Hello?

59:42.997 --> 59:44.232
Anybody in here?

59:47.101 --> 59:49.036
What the heck is this place?

59:50.771 --> 59:52.306
Some kind of libary?

59:53.941 --> 59:56.041
"Wreck-It Ralph is back."

59:56.043 --> 59:58.744
Hey, they're talking about me.

59:58.746 --> 01:00:01.814
Gee whiz,
the Internet is so positive.

01:00:01.816 --> 01:00:04.350
<i>"Fix-It Felix, Jr.</i>
was my favorite game."

01:00:04.352 --> 01:00:06.118
Hmm. Mine, too.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.156
"Ralph's videos stink."

01:00:08.956 --> 01:00:10.089
What?

01:00:10.091 --> 01:00:12.124
"So stupid."

01:00:12.126 --> 01:00:14.262
"Ralph is the worst."

01:00:15.363 --> 01:00:17.165
"I hate him."

01:00:17.965 --> 01:00:20.768
"He's so fat and ugly."

01:00:23.004 --> 01:00:27.342
"Just a worthless bum,
alone on a pile of bricks."

01:00:34.449 --> 01:00:37.216
Yo, Ralph,
you in here, dude?

01:00:37.218 --> 01:00:38.819
Hey, I got to show you...

01:00:40.087 --> 01:00:41.122
Oh.

01:00:42.023 --> 01:00:44.123
First rule
of the Internet...

01:00:44.125 --> 01:00:47.026
do not read the comments.

01:00:47.028 --> 01:00:48.263
I should have told you that.

01:00:49.398 --> 01:00:50.530
Look.

01:00:50.532 --> 01:00:53.832
This place can bring out
the worst in some people...

01:00:53.834 --> 01:00:55.435
but you gotta ignore all this.

01:00:55.437 --> 01:00:58.837
This isn't about you, Ralph.
It's about them.

01:00:58.839 --> 01:01:00.839
I don't care.
It's fine.

01:01:02.444 --> 01:01:05.314
People hated me my whole life
for being the bad guy.

01:01:06.448 --> 01:01:08.047
It's just a good reminder

01:01:08.049 --> 01:01:09.416
that this is the only heart

01:01:09.418 --> 01:01:10.252
that really matters.

01:01:11.118 --> 01:01:12.851
Vanellope gave me this...

01:01:12.853 --> 01:01:14.287
and as long as she likes me...

01:01:14.289 --> 01:01:16.122
I don't need anybody else.

01:01:16.124 --> 01:01:17.790
And I sure
don't need the Internet.

01:01:17.792 --> 01:01:19.259
Hold on.

01:01:19.261 --> 01:01:21.294
It's not all bad.

01:01:21.296 --> 01:01:23.296
The Internet
can also be a place...

01:01:23.298 --> 01:01:25.798
where you find a steering
wheel at one website...

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.135
and make enough money
to buy it at another one.

01:01:29.137 --> 01:01:31.271
Congratulations, Ralph.
You did it.

01:01:31.273 --> 01:01:32.539
Wait, really?

01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:34.907
Yes, check your
Buzzzy account.

01:01:34.909 --> 01:01:37.876
You needed 27K,
you got over 30 grand!

01:01:37.878 --> 01:01:39.112
Oh, my gosh!

01:01:39.114 --> 01:01:40.547
This is great!

01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:42.482
Thank you, Yesss. I couldn't
have done it without you!

01:01:42.484 --> 01:01:43.882
That's really true.

01:01:43.884 --> 01:01:45.318
Hey, eboy?

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.885
What do you need, ace?

01:01:46.887 --> 01:01:48.455
Can you give me a ride?

01:01:48.457 --> 01:01:50.525
Let's hop along, Cassidy.

01:01:51.892 --> 01:01:54.263
Come on, song, come on.

01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:56.831
I'm reflecting.

01:01:57.466 --> 01:01:58.831
What is it that I want?

01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:00.200
What is my quest?

01:02:00.202 --> 01:02:02.170
What is my dream?

01:02:04.406 --> 01:02:06.839
Well, ladies, I tried.

01:02:06.841 --> 01:02:09.309
No song for this princess,
I guess.

01:02:09.311 --> 01:02:11.246
Ooh! Huh.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.847
How does this thing work?

01:02:14.849 --> 01:02:16.249
<i>Hey, kid, can you see me?</i>

01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:18.151
Yeah! Yeah,
you're right there.

01:02:18.153 --> 01:02:20.253
<i>We did it! We got the money!</i>

01:02:20.255 --> 01:02:22.589
No way, Ralph!
That's great!

01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:25.091
I'm on my way to ebay
right now with the eboy.

01:02:25.093 --> 01:02:26.359
We're almost there, champ.

01:02:26.361 --> 01:02:27.494
Good work, eboy.

01:02:27.496 --> 01:02:29.929
Hey, meet me out in front of
ebay in five minutes, okay?

01:02:29.931 --> 01:02:31.498
<i>Okay, I'll see you soon.</i>

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.366
We're going home, kid!

01:02:33.368 --> 01:02:35.535
<i>Our lives can finally
get back to normal.</i>

01:02:35.537 --> 01:02:36.505
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:42.108
Wow, I can't believe it.
I get to go home.

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:43.510
So, I guess that's it.

01:02:43.512 --> 01:02:46.581
I guess I just wanted a...
a steering wheel.

01:02:47.516 --> 01:02:49.949
And now, I got it, so...

01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:51.253
whoo-hoo.

01:06:25.568 --> 01:06:27.768
Oh. Ralph. Ralph!
Hey, there.

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:28.836
Oh, hey, Spamley.

01:06:28.838 --> 01:06:30.170
What's the good word,
brother?

01:06:30.172 --> 01:06:32.606
Well, the good word is I just
paid for the steering wheel...

01:06:32.608 --> 01:06:34.141
and we are going home.

01:06:34.143 --> 01:06:35.242
Congratulations.

01:06:35.244 --> 01:06:36.510
Thanks.

01:06:36.512 --> 01:06:38.646
Hey, have you seen
Vanellope anywhere?

01:06:38.648 --> 01:06:40.748
Oh, uh, your little chum?
Uh, no, no, I haven't.

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.783
Hope she's not lost.

01:06:42.785 --> 01:06:44.720
Let me try to reach her
on this doohickey.

01:06:55.398 --> 01:06:57.298
See over there?
Over that mountain?

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.533
- Yeah.
- That's the Sequoia Speedway.

01:06:59.535 --> 01:07:01.168
<i>It's gonna be unlocked
next month.</i>

01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:03.170
Hey, what are you doing
in that awful game with her?

01:07:03.172 --> 01:07:04.705
<i>I think
the track will end...</i>

01:07:04.707 --> 01:07:07.308
right over there. Yo,
it's gonna be so tight.

01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:09.343
Oh, I love it.

01:07:09.345 --> 01:07:10.644
Hey, can I tell you something

01:07:10.646 --> 01:07:12.881
that I don't think
I could ever tell Ralph?

01:07:12.883 --> 01:07:14.315
Of course.

01:07:14.317 --> 01:07:15.850
I know it sounds crazy...

01:07:15.852 --> 01:07:19.355
but the second I walked
into this game, it felt...

01:07:20.222 --> 01:07:22.423
Well, it felt like home.

01:07:22.425 --> 01:07:24.793
I mean, more than
<i>Sugar Rush</i> ever did.

01:07:24.795 --> 01:07:26.795
Oh, yeah? How so?

01:07:26.797 --> 01:07:28.629
'Cause it's like my dream.

01:07:28.631 --> 01:07:30.832
It's full of weirdos...

01:07:30.834 --> 01:07:34.201
and the racing
is super dangerous...

01:07:34.203 --> 01:07:36.539
and you never know
what's gonna happen next.

01:07:37.406 --> 01:07:38.707
I mean, back home,

01:07:38.709 --> 01:07:41.175
I know exactly
what's gonna happen next...

01:07:41.177 --> 01:07:44.180
because Ralph's dream is to
do the same thing every day.

01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:47.483
Hmm.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:53.220
Here's something
I wish I'd learned years ago.

01:07:53.222 --> 01:07:54.889
There is no law

01:07:54.891 --> 01:07:58.325
saying best friends
have to have the same dreams.

01:07:58.327 --> 01:07:59.328
You know?

01:07:59.763 --> 01:08:00.895
Whoa.

01:08:00.897 --> 01:08:02.564
Yeah.

01:08:02.566 --> 01:08:05.934
You are a very
wise person, Shank.

01:08:05.936 --> 01:08:08.335
And a good friend, too.

01:08:08.337 --> 01:08:09.704
Thank you.

01:08:09.706 --> 01:08:11.873
Around here, peeps like
to say, "Shank you."

01:08:13.577 --> 01:08:15.510
You know,
after you go home

01:08:15.512 --> 01:08:17.411
and your life
gets back to normal...

01:08:17.412 --> 01:08:19.380
you are always
welcome here.

01:08:19.381 --> 01:08:22.383
But that's the thing,
I want this to be my normal.

01:08:22.385 --> 01:08:24.453
I want this to be my life.

01:08:25.287 --> 01:08:26.657
I can't go home now.

01:08:28.692 --> 01:08:29.926
I just can't.

01:08:38.267 --> 01:08:39.268
Wow.

01:08:40.301 --> 01:08:41.403
You know,
where I come from,

01:08:41.404 --> 01:08:43.705
that's called
a kick in the face.

01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:45.640
I can't believe it.

01:08:45.642 --> 01:08:48.609
A straight-up donkey kick
to the teeth.

01:08:48.612 --> 01:08:50.613
She's supposed to be
my best friend.

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:52.683
No, this can't be right.

01:08:53.984 --> 01:08:55.817
No, she's been brainwashed.

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:57.318
That's what this is.

01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:58.353
Because the Vanellope I know

01:08:58.354 --> 01:08:59.787
would never abandon me
like that.

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:01.555
I gotta get her out
of there now.

01:09:01.558 --> 01:09:03.825
Hey, easy now, tiger.

01:09:03.827 --> 01:09:04.959
I admire the impulse...

01:09:04.961 --> 01:09:07.495
but you charge in there
like some white knight...

01:09:07.497 --> 01:09:08.997
she's liable to hold it
against you.

01:09:08.999 --> 01:09:11.433
So what? I'm supposed to
just let her stay in a game

01:09:11.435 --> 01:09:12.567
that's obviously bad for her?

01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:13.768
Of course not.

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:15.703
Then how do I make her leave?

01:09:15.706 --> 01:09:18.807
She thinks it's so cool
and exciting in there.

01:09:18.809 --> 01:09:22.676
Unless you know how I can
make the game boring or...

01:09:22.679 --> 01:09:26.481
Wait. You know about viruses
and stuff, right, Spamley?

01:09:26.483 --> 01:09:28.450
- Who's asking?
- Whoa.

01:09:28.452 --> 01:09:29.783
Back home, me and the kid

01:09:29.786 --> 01:09:32.386
used to goof off
in this game called <i>Tron.</i>

01:09:32.389 --> 01:09:34.956
But then it got a virus that
made the motorbikes go slow...

01:09:34.957 --> 01:09:36.957
and then Vanellope stopped
wanting to hang out in there.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.626
So, is there a way

01:09:38.627 --> 01:09:40.795
to do something
like that to <i>Slaughter Race?</i>

01:09:40.796 --> 01:09:41.832
Oh, there's ways.

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.267
Follow me.

01:09:49.038 --> 01:09:50.638
I got mothers' maiden names...

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.974
social security numbers,
PIN numbers...

01:09:52.975 --> 01:09:54.409
Now, this area down here

01:09:54.411 --> 01:09:55.977
is what's called the Darknet.

01:09:55.979 --> 01:09:57.846
A lot of shady characters
hang out down here...

01:09:57.848 --> 01:10:00.014
so try to keep a low profile.
Gord!

01:10:00.016 --> 01:10:01.816
Oh, there you are.

01:10:01.818 --> 01:10:04.352
Now Gord here, he's
dabbled in virus-making.

01:10:04.354 --> 01:10:06.354
But his cousin, this guy
we're gonna go see...

01:10:06.356 --> 01:10:09.326
Double Dan, this dude
is a virus-making machine.

01:10:10.494 --> 01:10:11.526
Oh, oh, here we go.

01:10:11.528 --> 01:10:13.561
Are you sure this is safe?

01:10:13.563 --> 01:10:15.396
Is it safe?
Of course it is.

01:10:15.398 --> 01:10:18.366
Just whatever you do, do not
look at his little brother.

01:10:18.368 --> 01:10:19.870
Oh, he has a little brother?

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.473
Double Dan!

01:10:25.475 --> 01:10:26.875
Long time no see.

01:10:26.877 --> 01:10:28.376
Who are you?

01:10:28.378 --> 01:10:29.778
JP Spamley.

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.780
Uh, we met one time
over at Friendster...

01:10:31.782 --> 01:10:35.416
which tells you
it had to be a long time ago.

01:10:35.418 --> 01:10:36.886
- Oye. What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

01:10:36.888 --> 01:10:37.987
Are you looking at my brother?

01:10:37.989 --> 01:10:39.054
- No, sir.
- Don't you look

01:10:39.056 --> 01:10:40.022
at my little brother.

01:10:40.024 --> 01:10:42.357
- Oh, no, I wasn't.
- He's very self-conscious!

01:10:45.395 --> 01:10:46.661
You?

01:10:46.663 --> 01:10:48.530
What are you doing here?

01:10:48.532 --> 01:10:49.764
Uh...

01:10:49.766 --> 01:10:52.001
The reason I came to
your neck of the face...

01:10:52.003 --> 01:10:54.803
I mean, there's a face
in your neck. I mean, woods.

01:10:54.805 --> 01:10:57.139
Neck of the woods. The reason
I'm here is 'cause I...

01:10:57.141 --> 01:10:59.607
Well, I heard
a little tumor, rumor...

01:10:59.609 --> 01:11:01.043
I heard a rumor
that you could, well,

01:11:01.045 --> 01:11:03.444
give me a harmless virus
kind of thing...

01:11:03.446 --> 01:11:04.412
that might be able to

01:11:04.414 --> 01:11:06.414
slow down
the <i>Slaughter Ra</i> game?

01:11:06.416 --> 01:11:08.150
Oh, yeah.

01:11:08.152 --> 01:11:10.986
My cousin Gordon told me
that you wanted to crash it.

01:11:10.988 --> 01:11:12.087
Crash it? No!

01:11:12.089 --> 01:11:13.956
No, no, no.

01:11:13.958 --> 01:11:15.557
I don't want
anyone getting hurt.

01:11:15.559 --> 01:11:16.691
Hmm.

01:11:16.693 --> 01:11:18.761
If there's a way
to just, uh...

01:11:18.763 --> 01:11:19.728
I don't know...

01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:22.064
just make the cars
go slow or something...

01:11:22.066 --> 01:11:24.666
so the game is boring...

01:11:24.668 --> 01:11:26.802
and my friend
comes back home to me.

01:11:26.804 --> 01:11:30.706
Allow me to
introduce you to Arthur.

01:11:32.076 --> 01:11:34.109
Easy there, boy.

01:11:34.111 --> 01:11:35.945
He's keen.

01:11:35.947 --> 01:11:39.782
Arthur's what I call
an insecurity virus.

01:11:39.784 --> 01:11:42.617
Means he looks for
little flaws and weaknesses

01:11:42.619 --> 01:11:44.521
that make a program insecure.

01:11:47.058 --> 01:11:49.825
You release him into that
<i>Slaughter Race</i> game,

01:11:49.827 --> 01:11:52.560
Arthur will find some defect
in the code.

01:11:52.562 --> 01:11:54.129
Then he'll copy that defect

01:11:54.131 --> 01:11:56.866
and spread it
all over the game...

01:11:56.868 --> 01:12:00.501
until everything becomes,
quote, unquote, "boring"...

01:12:00.503 --> 01:12:02.938
just like you wanted.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.106
Okay.

01:12:04.108 --> 01:12:06.008
Just to be super clear here...

01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:07.475
no one gets hurt, right?

01:12:07.477 --> 01:12:08.611
Are you stupid?

01:12:08.613 --> 01:12:09.778
Well, uh...

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:11.981
Because the only way
anyone gets hurt...

01:12:11.983 --> 01:12:13.481
is if you are stupid.

01:12:13.483 --> 01:12:14.984
All you have to do...

01:12:14.986 --> 01:12:18.520
is make sure the virus stays
in <i>Slaughter Race.</i>

01:12:18.522 --> 01:12:20.522
Right. Don't be stupid.

01:12:20.524 --> 01:12:21.857
Make sure it doesn't get out
of <i>Slaughter Race.</i>

01:12:21.859 --> 01:12:22.958
Goiter it. Gah!

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.126
- Got it! Got it.
- Get out!

01:12:24.128 --> 01:12:25.661
Thank you,
you're a cyst face.

01:12:25.663 --> 01:12:26.829
- Out!
- I mean, assistance.

01:12:26.831 --> 01:12:28.697
Thank you for your
cyst face... Assistance.

01:12:28.699 --> 01:12:30.165
- Get out!
- Goodbye!

01:12:30.167 --> 01:12:31.734
Ugh.

01:12:34.872 --> 01:12:36.705
Ah! Fiddlesticks!
Well, that's game.

01:12:36.707 --> 01:12:38.040
Ah, beginner's luck.

01:12:38.042 --> 01:12:39.708
Come on, kid.
I know a hustle

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:40.809
when I see one.

01:12:41.946 --> 01:12:43.913
- Player's on the way.
- Thanks, Bob.

01:12:43.915 --> 01:12:45.514
- Let's roll!
- Game faces on, guys.

01:12:45.516 --> 01:12:47.616
Show time. You ready
for your first race?

01:12:47.618 --> 01:12:50.019
Um, yeah. I think so.

01:12:50.021 --> 01:12:52.621
Hey, don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.

01:12:52.623 --> 01:12:54.790
Yeah, no, I know.
I'll be fine.

01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:56.928
Mmm. You didn't tell
Ralph yet, did you?

01:12:58.062 --> 01:12:59.895
Not exactly.

01:12:59.897 --> 01:13:02.531
Come on, V.
He's your best friend.

01:13:02.533 --> 01:13:03.832
You gotta let him know

01:13:03.834 --> 01:13:05.567
you're planning on
staying here for a while.

01:13:05.569 --> 01:13:08.570
I know. But he's gonna
get really upset.

01:13:08.572 --> 01:13:10.572
Yeah, he might,
but you guys...

01:13:10.574 --> 01:13:13.175
you'll talk, you'll work it
out, you'll figure it out.

01:13:13.177 --> 01:13:14.977
Yeah, but what if we don't?

01:13:14.979 --> 01:13:17.780
What if his feelings
get hurt so bad...

01:13:17.782 --> 01:13:19.848
he won't wanna be
my friend anymore?

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:23.085
Look.
All friendships change...

01:13:23.087 --> 01:13:24.920
but the good ones...

01:13:24.922 --> 01:13:26.256
they get stronger
because of it.

01:13:27.725 --> 01:13:29.625
Uh, Shank,
I hate to bother you...

01:13:29.627 --> 01:13:31.961
but the player is waiting.

01:13:31.963 --> 01:13:33.829
I'm not gonna tell you
what to do, kid.

01:13:33.831 --> 01:13:34.899
It's your call.

01:13:35.733 --> 01:13:36.767
Yeah, okay.

01:13:37.702 --> 01:13:38.767
All right.

01:13:38.769 --> 01:13:39.937
Let's race.

01:13:54.219 --> 01:13:56.254
<i>Scanning for insecurities.</i>

01:13:58.823 --> 01:14:00.524
<i>Scanning for insecurities.</i>

01:14:02.893 --> 01:14:05.061
<i>"Precious Car-go."</i>

01:14:05.063 --> 01:14:07.029
<i>Deliver the car
to Bert's Chop Shop...</i>

01:14:07.031 --> 01:14:09.965
<i>but watch out
for Shank and her crew.</i>

01:14:27.952 --> 01:14:29.818
Power drift
into a drift jump!

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:31.820
I saw it! You're amazing!

01:14:31.822 --> 01:14:32.823
Thank you.

01:14:41.933 --> 01:14:44.970
<i>Scanning for insecurities.</i>

01:14:49.074 --> 01:14:51.742
Looks like we're not finished.
Come on, V.

01:14:54.146 --> 01:14:55.744
Ralph?

01:15:00.285 --> 01:15:01.617
Huh.

01:15:01.619 --> 01:15:04.120
Okay. Relax. Relax!

01:15:04.122 --> 01:15:05.321
I'll just call him
after the race.

01:15:05.323 --> 01:15:06.956
It'll be okay.

01:15:06.958 --> 01:15:08.126
<i>Ralph will be fine.</i>

01:15:09.795 --> 01:15:11.063
<i>Insecurity detected.</i>

01:15:13.131 --> 01:15:14.665
<i>Copying insecurity.</i>

01:15:17.903 --> 01:15:20.303
<i>Distributing insecurity.</i>

01:15:20.305 --> 01:15:22.372
<i>Distributing insecurity.</i>

01:15:22.374 --> 01:15:25.942
<i>Distributing insecurity.
Distributing...</i>

01:15:25.944 --> 01:15:28.847
What is happening?

01:15:34.753 --> 01:15:36.052
What's going on, Spamley?

01:15:36.054 --> 01:15:38.088
The whole place
is going crazy.

01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:40.156
I thought that virus was just
supposed to slow down her car.

01:15:40.158 --> 01:15:41.257
It was.

01:15:41.259 --> 01:15:43.128
It must've found something
real unstable in there.

01:15:44.729 --> 01:15:46.830
It's her glitch.

01:15:46.832 --> 01:15:48.331
<i>Game reboot begins</i>

01:15:48.333 --> 01:15:50.166
<i>in 60 seconds.</i>

01:15:50.168 --> 01:15:51.968
Whoa, hey! Hey, Ralph,
you can't go in there.

01:15:51.970 --> 01:15:52.936
They're gonna
reboot the game...

01:15:52.938 --> 01:15:54.270
and anything that doesn't
belong in there

01:15:54.272 --> 01:15:55.371
will be deleted.

01:15:55.373 --> 01:15:56.940
Yeah, and if I don't
get her outta there,

01:15:56.942 --> 01:15:58.310
Vanellope's gonna die!

01:16:01.079 --> 01:16:03.213
Come on, kid. The game's crashing.
Let's go.

01:16:03.215 --> 01:16:04.781
I think it's my glitch.

01:16:04.783 --> 01:16:07.884
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
destroy your game.

01:16:07.886 --> 01:16:10.954
We'll be fine, but your code
isn't part of this game.

01:16:10.956 --> 01:16:13.758
We got to get you out of here now.
Follow me to the exit.

01:16:22.701 --> 01:16:24.400
Oh, no, no!

01:16:30.909 --> 01:16:32.041
Kid!

01:16:32.043 --> 01:16:34.177
Kid, where are you?

01:16:34.179 --> 01:16:36.379
The server
is rebooting, Ralph.

01:16:36.381 --> 01:16:38.449
Both of you have to
get out of here now.

01:16:38.451 --> 01:16:39.718
Kid, I got you. I got you.

01:16:41.753 --> 01:16:42.952
<i>Game reboot...</i>

01:16:42.954 --> 01:16:46.923
<i>in five, four, three...</i>

01:16:46.925 --> 01:16:48.825
<i>two, one.</i>

01:16:50.996 --> 01:16:52.797
<i>Reboot in progress.</i>

01:16:56.268 --> 01:16:58.301

01:16:58.303 --> 01:17:00.471
Come on. Don't leave me, kid.

01:17:03.141 --> 01:17:04.441
Ralph?

01:17:04.443 --> 01:17:07.245
Oh. There you are.
You okay, kid?

01:17:07.979 --> 01:17:11.448
Ralph, I messed up so bad.

01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:14.150
No. No, you didn't,
it's okay.

01:17:14.152 --> 01:17:17.220
This is all because of me
and my glitch.

01:17:17.222 --> 01:17:19.122
I should've
just stayed with you...

01:17:19.124 --> 01:17:21.824
instead of following
some stupid dream.

01:17:23.396 --> 01:17:25.398
I've ruined everything.

01:17:25.997 --> 01:17:27.799
No, kid, no.

01:17:29.768 --> 01:17:33.470
Ah, look. I didn't mean
for it to happen like this.

01:17:33.472 --> 01:17:36.275
It was not supposed
to be this bad.

01:17:39.177 --> 01:17:42.145
You didn't mean
for what to happen?

01:17:42.147 --> 01:17:45.817
I mighta,
kinda sorta put a...

01:17:47.118 --> 01:17:50.187
harmless little virus
in the game.

01:17:50.189 --> 01:17:52.423
A virus?

01:17:52.425 --> 01:17:54.991
You did this?

01:17:54.993 --> 01:17:57.127
I wouldn't have done anything

01:17:57.129 --> 01:17:58.495
if I hadn't heard you
tell Shank...

01:17:58.497 --> 01:18:00.297
that you wanted to live in
<i>Slaughter Race</i> forever.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.000
So you were spying on me?

01:18:04.002 --> 01:18:06.170
Hey. You're not exactly
innocent here.

01:18:06.172 --> 01:18:08.838
You were gonna ditch everybody
and abandon <i>Sugar Rush.</i>

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.840
Oh, please.
I'm one of 16 racers.

01:18:10.842 --> 01:18:12.176
They'd never miss me.

01:18:12.178 --> 01:18:13.510
What about me?

01:18:13.512 --> 01:18:16.045
Why would I ever spend
another second with you...

01:18:16.047 --> 01:18:17.216
after what you did?

01:18:19.118 --> 01:18:20.353
No!

01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:25.790
No.

01:18:26.459 --> 01:18:28.158
Vanellope,
where are you going?

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.560
Wherever you're not.

01:18:29.562 --> 01:18:30.893
Wait a minute.
I can explain.

01:18:30.895 --> 01:18:32.596
No! You will not
follow me.

01:18:32.598 --> 01:18:34.164
Vanellope, please...

01:18:34.166 --> 01:18:36.899
A friend would never do
what you did. Never!

01:18:36.901 --> 01:18:39.336
So you leave me alone!

01:18:39.338 --> 01:18:42.006
Vanellope, no, no, no! Please!

01:18:42.008 --> 01:18:44.575
Please! What did I do?

01:18:44.577 --> 01:18:46.310
<i>Scanning for insecurities.</i>

01:18:46.312 --> 01:18:47.980
<i>Vanellope, come on,
don't leave me!</i>

01:18:49.015 --> 01:18:50.349
<i>Insecurity detected.</i>

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.222
<i>Copying insecurity.</i>

01:18:58.591 --> 01:19:01.292
Oh, no, no, no.

01:19:01.294 --> 01:19:03.029
<i>Distributing insecurity.</i>

01:19:13.072 --> 01:19:14.073
Come on.

01:19:16.876 --> 01:19:17.476
Where is it?

01:19:20.279 --> 01:19:21.314
Ooh!

01:19:26.352 --> 01:19:27.219
Oh, no.

01:19:43.302 --> 01:19:45.204
You are such an idiot.

01:19:56.949 --> 01:20:01.452
What is your problem, Ralph?
I told you, don't follow me.

01:20:01.454 --> 01:20:03.655
Friend?

01:20:03.657 --> 01:20:05.956
Cut that out.
You're scaring me.

01:20:05.958 --> 01:20:08.092
- Friend!
- Huh? Whoa!

01:20:08.094 --> 01:20:09.995
- What the...?
- Friend?

01:20:13.966 --> 01:20:15.434
Friend!

01:20:21.941 --> 01:20:24.308
Sweet mother of Ralph!

01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:25.309
<i>In breaking news,</i>

01:20:25.311 --> 01:20:26.443
<i>the Internet

01:20:26.445 --> 01:20:29.279

Friend?

01:20:49.268 --> 01:20:50.568
Huh?

01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:52.537

01:20:57.343 --> 01:20:58.678
Friend.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.479
Friend.

01:21:03.382 --> 01:21:05.048
Friend!

01:21:05.050 --> 01:21:06.318
Friend!

01:21:08.655 --> 01:21:10.388
I found 130 results for

01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:12.426
"Where does my high school
girlfriend live now?"

01:21:14.093 --> 01:21:15.225
You're welcome.

01:21:15.227 --> 01:21:16.962
- Mr. KnowsMore!
- Hmm.

01:21:17.464 --> 01:21:18.663
Oh, delightful!

01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:20.331
You're that courteous
little cherub

01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:21.999
who says "please"
and "thank you."

01:21:22.001 --> 01:21:23.334
What can KnowsMore
help you find today?

01:21:23.336 --> 01:21:24.402
There's a whole...

01:21:24.404 --> 01:21:25.703
Whole Foods,
a hole in the ozone...

01:21:25.705 --> 01:21:28.406
<i>A Whole Lotta Love</i> by
British rockers Led Zeppelin?

01:21:28.408 --> 01:21:31.208
No! No! There's a whole bunch
of Ralphs chasing me.

01:21:31.210 --> 01:21:33.745
Friend...

01:21:33.747 --> 01:21:35.680
This would probably be
an appropriate time

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:36.982
for me to shutter my site.

01:21:44.724 --> 01:21:46.089
How long you think

01:21:46.091 --> 01:21:47.459
before they get in here?

01:21:47.461 --> 01:21:49.563
Precisely one second.

01:21:51.598 --> 01:21:53.198
Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:54.365
Hey, hey, hey!

01:21:54.367 --> 01:21:55.667
It's me!
It's the real me!

01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:58.236
Ow!

01:21:58.238 --> 01:22:00.572
- Ralph?
- My apologies.

01:22:00.574 --> 01:22:01.706
I followed those things here.

01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:03.008
I think they're looking
for you, kid.

01:22:04.144 --> 01:22:07.245
Yeah, you think?
What did you do?

01:22:07.247 --> 01:22:10.381
I'm so sorry.
I don't how this happened.

01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:11.483
Well, I think
it's fairly obvious.

01:22:11.485 --> 01:22:14.118
It happened because
an insecurity virus cloned...

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.621
all of your needy, clingy,
self-destructive behavior.

01:22:16.623 --> 01:22:18.323
The very behavior
which left unchecked

01:22:18.325 --> 01:22:19.691
can destroy friendships...

01:22:19.693 --> 01:22:23.361
and in this particular case,
the entire Internet!

01:22:25.265 --> 01:22:27.131
KnowsMore!
You have all the answers.

01:22:27.133 --> 01:22:28.433
Official query...

01:22:28.435 --> 01:22:30.468
what do I do if clones of me

01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:33.071
are trying to capture
my friend? Search.

01:22:34.374 --> 01:22:36.574
I find two results
for your query.

01:22:36.576 --> 01:22:38.710
Either you put all the clones
in therapy.

01:22:38.712 --> 01:22:40.678
Not very realistic.

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.647
Or, the anti-virus district
is surrounded

01:22:42.649 --> 01:22:44.716
by a gate made from
security software.

01:22:44.718 --> 01:22:45.683
If Vanellope could somehow

01:22:45.685 --> 01:22:47.185
lead all of the clones
through the gate...

01:22:47.187 --> 01:22:49.187
they would be deleted
all at once.

01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:52.390
Sort of a co-dependent
pied piper situation.

01:22:52.392 --> 01:22:55.126
Wait. We know a pied piper.

01:22:55.128 --> 01:22:56.561
- We do?
- Yesss.

01:22:56.563 --> 01:22:58.129
- Who?
- Yesss!

01:22:58.131 --> 01:22:58.798
Yeah, but who is it?

01:23:01.201 --> 01:23:02.636
Oh, you mean Yesss!

01:23:06.573 --> 01:23:09.440
Thanks for your help,
KnowsMore.

01:23:09.442 --> 01:23:11.175
It's a bit of an empty gesture
at this point,

01:23:11.177 --> 01:23:13.378
wouldn't you say?

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.779
Guess I forgot
to tell Ralph

01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:16.514
that when you
break the Internet...

01:23:16.516 --> 01:23:19.317
you don't literally
have to break the Internet.

01:23:19.319 --> 01:23:20.552
I can't believe he did this.

01:23:20.554 --> 01:23:23.187
Yeah, well, I mean,
dude obviously made

01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:25.323
some real questionable
choices here.

01:23:25.325 --> 01:23:29.460
But he also made a bee pun to
save his best friend's game...

01:23:29.462 --> 01:23:33.266
so what can I say, kid,
life's complicated.

01:23:34.334 --> 01:23:36.303
You ready to pied the piper?

01:23:39.339 --> 01:23:41.341
Yoo-hoo! Up here!

01:23:42.777 --> 01:23:45.878
It's me, your bestest friend
in the whole wide world...

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.280
who you can't live without!

01:23:48.248 --> 01:23:49.817
Friend!

01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:55.620
Wow, from up here I can see
how I do come across as...

01:23:55.622 --> 01:23:57.388
needy, and clingy,

01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:59.760
and self-destructive
like KnowsMore said.

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:02.460
Listen, kid...

01:24:02.462 --> 01:24:03.328
I don't blame you

01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:05.597
for not wanting
to be my friend anymore.

01:24:05.599 --> 01:24:07.766
I never said I didn't
want to be your friend.

01:24:07.768 --> 01:24:11.469
I said you were acting like
a bad friend. Which you were.

01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:13.204
I know I was, but I...

01:24:13.206 --> 01:24:14.339
Hey, my babies!

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:17.475
That's the anti-virus district
straight ahead. Whoo!

01:24:17.477 --> 01:24:19.145
All right, to be
continued, okay?

01:24:26.821 --> 01:24:28.821
Whoo-hoo!
We're gonna make it!

01:24:44.839 --> 01:24:46.270
You guys okay?

01:24:46.272 --> 01:24:47.539
I'm fine!

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:50.542
Yeah, all good.
Look, we can still do this.

01:24:50.544 --> 01:24:52.845
Come on, big man.
Help me turn this thing over.

01:24:53.948 --> 01:24:56.280
Uh...

01:24:56.282 --> 01:24:58.484
Uh, guys?

01:25:08.863 --> 01:25:12.296
Friend?

01:25:12.298 --> 01:25:14.566
That is unsettling.

01:25:18.406 --> 01:25:19.707
Friend.

01:25:20.408 --> 01:25:21.974
Get Vanellope out of here now.

01:25:21.976 --> 01:25:23.108
What about you, Ralph?

01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:25.245
Just go. I got a date with
the man in the mirror.

01:25:26.279 --> 01:25:27.615
Hey, you!

01:25:30.484 --> 01:25:32.951
You keep away from her!

01:25:32.953 --> 01:25:35.621
I'm gonna wreck it!

01:25:37.825 --> 01:25:40.661
She's not your friend!

01:25:41.429 --> 01:25:43.229
She's my friend!

01:25:44.331 --> 01:25:45.698
Here it is, this way.

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:47.768
Come on, kid.
We gotta move.

01:26:00.347 --> 01:26:01.682
Eeeee-oh-boy!

01:26:18.766 --> 01:26:19.834
No!

01:26:20.868 --> 01:26:22.534
Whoa!

01:26:22.536 --> 01:26:25.706
Vanellope!

01:26:30.377 --> 01:26:32.646
Hey! Let go of me!

01:26:35.316 --> 01:26:36.784
- Kid!
- Ralph!

01:26:41.622 --> 01:26:43.355
Hey!

01:26:43.357 --> 01:26:45.791
Hey, get back here!

01:26:45.793 --> 01:26:46.794
Huh?

01:26:48.562 --> 01:26:49.995
You put her down!

01:26:49.997 --> 01:26:51.830
Whoa!

01:27:13.922 --> 01:27:15.489
Vanellope!

01:27:31.739 --> 01:27:35.010
You know, you're acting
like a real bad guy here!

01:27:35.676 --> 01:27:38.077
No!

01:27:38.079 --> 01:27:39.611
Well, you are!

01:27:39.613 --> 01:27:41.549
And I will never
be your friend!

01:27:45.753 --> 01:27:47.055
Hey, doofus!

01:27:47.956 --> 01:27:48.756
Ralph!

01:27:56.697 --> 01:27:58.934
Catch me if you can,
you big dummy!

01:28:05.639 --> 01:28:07.040
I got you, little sister.

01:28:10.745 --> 01:28:12.411
Now go!
Get out of here!

01:28:12.413 --> 01:28:14.080
- Ralph!
- Go!

01:28:14.082 --> 01:28:16.885
No!
Don't hurt him!

01:28:17.551 --> 01:28:18.619
Please, no!

01:28:23.424 --> 01:28:25.892
Stop it!
You're squishing him!

01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:29.629
You're gonna
kill my best friend!

01:28:33.835 --> 01:28:36.104
Fine! You win!
You win, okay?

01:28:39.608 --> 01:28:41.910
Just please put him down.

01:28:44.546 --> 01:28:47.080
I'll be your
only friend, okay?

01:28:47.082 --> 01:28:49.148
Just let him go.

01:28:49.150 --> 01:28:50.752
No! No, kid.

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:52.921
Huh?

01:28:54.556 --> 01:28:56.789
That's it.
That's it. Yeah.

01:28:56.791 --> 01:28:59.659
Put him down
and I'll go with you...

01:28:59.661 --> 01:29:01.160
and we'll be
best friends forever.

01:29:02.530 --> 01:29:04.664
Just me and you.

01:29:04.666 --> 01:29:05.867
That's what you want, right?

01:29:09.137 --> 01:29:10.437
Well,
that's not what I want!

01:29:12.207 --> 01:29:14.774
It's not right to hold
a friend back from her dreams!

01:29:14.776 --> 01:29:16.910
You don't own her!

01:29:16.912 --> 01:29:19.712
That's not how
friendship works!

01:29:19.714 --> 01:29:21.549
You need to let her go!

01:29:23.685 --> 01:29:24.686
Hey.

01:29:28.723 --> 01:29:29.824
You need to let her go.

01:29:32.861 --> 01:29:35.931
I know. It's gonna hurt
a little bit when you do.

01:29:37.899 --> 01:29:39.834
Oh, who am I kidding?
It's gonna hurt a lot.

01:29:41.703 --> 01:29:43.905
But you're gonna be okay.

01:29:46.574 --> 01:29:48.274
And we're gonna be okay.

01:29:48.276 --> 01:29:49.544
Right, kid?

01:29:51.179 --> 01:29:53.848
Of course we are. Always.

01:29:55.984 --> 01:29:59.052
See? No matter
where she goes...

01:29:59.054 --> 01:30:01.888
or where she lives...

01:30:01.890 --> 01:30:04.157
she's always gonna
be our friend.

01:30:04.159 --> 01:30:06.626
And we just gotta trust her.

01:30:06.628 --> 01:30:09.064
Because that's what
best friends do.

01:30:10.165 --> 01:30:11.666
Right?

01:30:26.248 --> 01:30:27.582
Thanks, buddy.

01:30:29.050 --> 01:30:30.986
Wow!

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:34.587
I feel good about this.

01:30:34.589 --> 01:30:36.589
Mmm.

01:30:36.591 --> 01:30:38.927
Mmm.

01:30:40.962 --> 01:30:42.129
Ralph, look!

01:30:42.131 --> 01:30:44.065
I think you fixed
your insecurity!

01:30:46.068 --> 01:30:47.301
You're right.

01:30:47.303 --> 01:30:49.635
Whoo-hoo!

01:30:49.637 --> 01:30:50.803
Ralph, no!

01:30:52.807 --> 01:30:54.308
Whoa!

01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:56.310
Park it right here, Ralph!

01:30:56.312 --> 01:30:58.644
Your ol' pal
JP Spamley's gotcha!

01:30:58.646 --> 01:31:00.815
Whoo!

01:31:02.151 --> 01:31:03.217
Wow, that didn't work.

01:31:07.856 --> 01:31:09.756
Look up there!

01:31:09.758 --> 01:31:11.626
It's a big strong man
in need of rescuing.

01:31:20.269 --> 01:31:21.070
Hah!

01:32:10.119 --> 01:32:12.154
Mmm.

01:32:14.190 --> 01:32:16.125
Oh, thanks, Frogger.

01:32:16.658 --> 01:32:17.793
Wait a minute.

01:32:18.327 --> 01:32:19.960
Who are all of you?

01:32:19.962 --> 01:32:21.995
We're friends of Vanellope's.

01:32:21.997 --> 01:32:24.164
Yeah, and any friend
of Vanellope's

01:32:24.166 --> 01:32:25.799
is a friend of ours.

01:32:25.801 --> 01:32:27.668
You're welcome.

01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:29.036
Ralph!

01:32:29.038 --> 01:32:31.138
Looking good, big fella!

01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:32.773
Heyo!

01:32:33.876 --> 01:32:35.075
This dress is not made
for a big boy.

01:32:35.077 --> 01:32:37.077
It's going right up
the back alley there.

01:32:37.079 --> 01:32:38.745
Let me just make
a little adjustment.

01:32:38.747 --> 01:32:41.181
There we go.

01:32:41.183 --> 01:32:42.783
<i>Internet users are breathing</i>

01:32:42.785 --> 01:32:45.085
<i>a collective sigh
of relief tonight.</i>

01:32:45.087 --> 01:32:47.421
<i>Just as mysteriously
as it appeared,</i>

01:32:47.423 --> 01:32:49.825
<i>the Wreck-It Ralph virus
has vanished.</i>

01:32:56.098 --> 01:32:58.198
You know what
I just realized?

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.934
The sun never rises
or sets here...

01:33:00.936 --> 01:33:02.903
because everything's
always on.

01:33:02.905 --> 01:33:05.472
Well, now, isn't that
an astute observation?

01:33:05.474 --> 01:33:07.040
I know, right?

01:33:07.042 --> 01:33:08.242
You know,
other than KnowsMore,

01:33:08.244 --> 01:33:10.010
I'm probably the smartest guy
on the Internet.

01:33:10.012 --> 01:33:12.045
Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:12.047 --> 01:33:15.048
Yo, V. We're about to come
back online. You ready?

01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:16.450
Be right there!

01:33:16.452 --> 01:33:19.119
Hey, Ralph,
don't be a stranger!

01:33:19.121 --> 01:33:21.722
Well, I can't be much stranger
than you, Shank.

01:33:21.724 --> 01:33:24.126
Oh. That's a good dad joke.

01:33:25.428 --> 01:33:27.127
Hey, don't forget.

01:33:27.129 --> 01:33:29.062
You know Shank added
my code and everything,

01:33:29.064 --> 01:33:30.898
so I'll be able
to regenerate.

01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:32.032
I'm gonna be totally safe.

01:33:32.034 --> 01:33:34.469
No, I know.
It's gonna be great.

01:33:34.471 --> 01:33:36.069
You found your dream game.

01:33:36.071 --> 01:33:37.339
Yeah, I did.

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:39.241
I did.

01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:42.242
So, uh...

01:33:42.244 --> 01:33:45.279
I guess I should probably
head in there now, you know?

01:33:45.281 --> 01:33:48.250
Oh, before you go,
I wanted to give you this.

01:33:49.318 --> 01:33:52.152
Oh, I'm so sorry
I broke it, Ralph.

01:33:52.154 --> 01:33:54.188
No, no. It's okay.

01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:56.225
Now we can both
have a half. See?

01:33:58.295 --> 01:33:59.094
Yeah!

01:34:06.869 --> 01:34:08.804
I love you so much.

01:34:09.939 --> 01:34:11.308
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:34:13.175 --> 01:34:15.110
I'm gonna miss you too, kid.

01:34:16.313 --> 01:34:17.846
I really am.

01:34:23.453 --> 01:34:24.454
All right.

01:34:26.356 --> 01:34:28.291
Okay, getting a little clingy
on me, here.

01:34:31.194 --> 01:34:33.228
Go on. Get out of here.

01:34:33.230 --> 01:34:34.497
The world's
waiting for you, kid.

01:35:32.122 --> 01:35:34.188
<i>I'll be honest,</i>

01:35:34.190 --> 01:35:36.491
<i>it still feels kind of
weird around here.</i>

01:35:36.493 --> 01:35:38.526
<i>I mean, a lot has changed.</i>

01:35:38.528 --> 01:35:39.994
<i>Even though we got
that steering wheel</i>

01:35:39.996 --> 01:35:41.062
<i>and saved</i> Sugar Rush...

01:35:41.064 --> 01:35:43.233
<i>it's never really gonna
be the same.</i>

01:35:45.235 --> 01:35:46.434
<i>For one thing,
the racers aren't even</i>

01:35:46.436 --> 01:35:48.036
<i>that obnoxious anymore.</i>

01:35:48.038 --> 01:35:50.438
Oh, golly. I'm sorry
you didn't win, Taffyta.

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:53.074
Pfft! Our friendship
is much more important to me

01:35:53.076 --> 01:35:54.375
than winning, Rancis.

01:35:54.377 --> 01:35:56.110
Losing builds character!

01:35:56.112 --> 01:35:58.046
Everyone's a winner, Taffyta.

01:35:58.048 --> 01:35:59.580
<i>Felix and Calhoun,</i>

01:35:59.582 --> 01:36:00.782
<i>as goofy as they are,</i>

01:36:00.784 --> 01:36:03.217
<i>they turned out to be
pretty great parents.</i>

01:36:03.219 --> 01:36:04.519
I gotta hand it
to you two,

01:36:04.521 --> 01:36:07.021
how on earth did you
tame those things?

01:36:07.023 --> 01:36:08.389
It's simple, Surge.

01:36:08.391 --> 01:36:10.992
The key to parenting is...

01:36:13.963 --> 01:36:15.930
And then what you do is...

01:36:18.401 --> 01:36:21.636
And that is the secret
to raising perfect children.

01:36:21.638 --> 01:36:25.073
Wow, I wish every parent
could hear that.

01:36:25.075 --> 01:36:26.441
<i>I'm keeping busy, too.</i>

01:36:26.443 --> 01:36:28.376
<i>I finally joined
Zangief's book club.</i>

01:36:28.378 --> 01:36:30.445
Good point, Bison.
And how about you, Ralph?

01:36:30.447 --> 01:36:32.380
Do you feel Dostoyevsky

01:36:32.382 --> 01:36:34.982
intended to make
narrator unreliable?

01:36:34.984 --> 01:36:36.451
Um...

01:36:36.453 --> 01:36:38.654
I do and I don't.

01:36:38.656 --> 01:36:41.222
You do, and you don't.

01:36:41.224 --> 01:36:43.991
Duality.
That's really deep, Ralph.

01:36:43.993 --> 01:36:45.293
Thanks, Sonic.

01:36:45.295 --> 01:36:48.029
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

01:36:48.031 --> 01:36:50.365
<i>Oh. And we got this new thing
we do every Friday night...</i>

01:36:50.367 --> 01:36:52.467
<i>where we all go and hang out
in a different game.</i>

01:36:52.469 --> 01:36:54.135
<i>I actually hosted this week.</i>

01:36:54.137 --> 01:36:55.536
Heyo!

01:36:55.538 --> 01:36:58.139
Hope you're all hungry.
I made burnt pie.

01:36:58.141 --> 01:37:00.007
What's burnt pie,
Wreck-It?

01:37:00.009 --> 01:37:02.310
Oh, it's just a pie
that you burn.

01:37:02.312 --> 01:37:03.244
You can use any pie.

01:37:03.246 --> 01:37:05.012
You just leave it
in the oven too long.

01:37:08.151 --> 01:37:11.319
<i>Yeah, we really do
have a lot of fun.</i>

01:37:11.321 --> 01:37:14.656
I guess that's pretty much
all the news I got for you.

01:37:14.658 --> 01:37:17.392
<i>Oh, man, your stories
never disappoint, Ralph.</i>

01:37:17.394 --> 01:37:18.993
<i>I just wish
we could hang out sooner.</i>

01:37:18.995 --> 01:37:20.496
Yeah. Me, too.

01:37:20.498 --> 01:37:22.196
When did you say you were
getting those days off?

01:37:22.198 --> 01:37:24.999
<i>Uh, our upgrade
starts on January 25th,</i>

01:37:25.001 --> 01:37:26.702
<i>so, like, two months
from now.</i>

01:37:26.704 --> 01:37:29.370
Oh, that'll go by in a flash.
Oh, speaking of which...

01:37:29.372 --> 01:37:30.472
you want me to bring you
anything from home

01:37:30.474 --> 01:37:31.473
when I come visit?

01:37:31.475 --> 01:37:33.542
<i>Oh! You know what
I cannot find</i>

01:37:33.544 --> 01:37:35.309
<i>anywhere on the Internet?</i>

01:37:35.311 --> 01:37:38.246
<i>A halfway decent</i>
BurgerTime <i>burger.</i>

01:37:38.248 --> 01:37:40.549
<i>I've been talking them up
to Shank and the crew.</i>

01:37:40.551 --> 01:37:42.283
<i>And honestly, I think
they're starting to think</i>

01:37:42.285 --> 01:37:43.452
<i>I'm making it up.</i>

01:37:43.454 --> 01:37:44.720
All right,
consider it done.

01:37:44.722 --> 01:37:46.390
I'll bring you guys
a truckload.

01:37:48.726 --> 01:37:51.058
Well, sun's coming up already.

01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:52.528
Guess I better get to it.

01:37:52.530 --> 01:37:54.028
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:55.196
<i>Talk next week?</i>

01:37:55.198 --> 01:37:57.064
I shall await your call,
madam.

01:37:57.066 --> 01:38:01.670
<i>Then,</i> adieu, adieu,
<i>farting is such sweet sorrow.</i>

01:38:01.672 --> 01:38:03.973
<i>So long, stinkbrain.</i>

01:38:04.542 --> 01:38:05.443
Bye, kid.

01:38:19.356 --> 01:38:22.357
Hey. You doing
okay there, Ralph?

01:38:22.359 --> 01:38:26.595
Yeah, I am, actually.
I'm doing great.

01:38:26.597 --> 01:38:29.333
Come on, Felix.
Let's get to work, buddy.

01:42:00.745 --> 01:42:03.813
Hey, Mo, did you like
the movie, sweetie?

01:42:03.815 --> 01:42:06.416
Well, there was a scene
in the trailer...

01:42:06.418 --> 01:42:08.451
that wasn't in the movie...

01:42:08.453 --> 01:42:10.887
and that makes me sad.

01:42:10.889 --> 01:42:12.989
Aw, that's too bad.

01:42:12.991 --> 01:42:14.590
Maybe playing your game
will cheer you up.

01:42:14.592 --> 01:42:15.593
Okay.

01:42:18.029 --> 01:42:19.762
Pancake.

01:42:19.764 --> 01:42:20.865
Milkshake.

01:42:21.933 --> 01:42:24.469
Pancake.
Pancake.

01:42:25.003 --> 01:42:26.234
Milkshake.

01:42:26.236 --> 01:42:27.804
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh.
I wanna try, I wanna try!</i>

01:42:27.806 --> 01:42:29.272
<i>My turn, my turn!</i>

01:42:29.274 --> 01:42:31.307
<i>Pancake. Milkshake.</i>

01:42:31.309 --> 01:42:33.676
<i>Milkshake. Milkshake.</i>

01:42:33.678 --> 01:42:35.511
Pancake. Pancake.

01:42:35.513 --> 01:42:37.847
Milkshake.
Milkshake.

01:42:37.849 --> 01:42:39.582
I'm starting to understand
why people like this game.

01:42:39.584 --> 01:42:40.983
Very zen.

01:42:42.921 --> 01:42:45.621
Hey, everybody,
look what I found!

01:42:45.623 --> 01:42:47.757
- More pancakes!
- Sweet!

01:42:47.759 --> 01:42:49.992
Let's speed it up.
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

01:42:49.994 --> 01:42:51.461
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

01:42:51.463 --> 01:42:53.496
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

01:42:53.498 --> 01:42:55.631
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

01:42:55.633 --> 01:42:57.900
Eat, little bunny.
Eat, eat, eat!

01:42:57.902 --> 01:42:59.535
Uh, Ralph, you might wanna try
feeding the kitty

01:42:59.537 --> 01:43:01.037
for a little while.

01:43:01.039 --> 01:43:03.773
No, the kitty gets
the milkshake.

01:43:03.775 --> 01:43:07.612
The bunny gets the pancake.
