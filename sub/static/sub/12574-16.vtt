<i>Richard Cypher,</i>
<i>you are the true Seeker.</i>

00:23.672 --> 00:26.607
It's a good thing Mord'Sith
are used to torture...

00:26.608 --> 00:29.877
because that's exactly what
eating this stew will be.

00:29.878 --> 00:31.812
( sniffs )

00:33.315 --> 00:36.684
Well, maybe Zedd and Kahlan'll
find some mushrooms.

00:36.685 --> 00:39.620
It's gonna take more
than mushrooms to save this.

00:39.621 --> 00:41.555
( rustling )

00:43.658 --> 00:46.060
( woman panting )

00:46.061 --> 00:47.495
( rustling continues )

00:47.496 --> 00:48.696
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

00:51.066 --> 00:53.868
We went to town
for provisions, gars attacked.

00:53.869 --> 00:55.736
Where's Zedd?
Trying to fight them off.

01:10.919 --> 01:12.653
Zedd followed them
in here.

01:15.257 --> 01:17.191
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

01:20.662 --> 01:22.863
(All)
Happy birthday!

01:22.864 --> 01:24.999
( all laughing )

01:26.468 --> 01:29.637
We couldn't celebrate with
that awful meal, now could we?

01:32.207 --> 01:33.574
Were you in on this too?

01:33.575 --> 01:37.344
I suggested we celebrate
your birthday the Mord'Sith way.

01:37.345 --> 01:40.481
I didn't think Mord'Sith
celebrated birthdays.

01:40.482 --> 01:42.483
We don't.

01:42.484 --> 01:45.119
Richard, I'd like you to meet
our generous host,

01:45.120 --> 01:46.854
Duke Anders.

01:48.457 --> 01:50.958
Thank you. I hope you didn't go
to too much trouble.

01:50.959 --> 01:52.793
Not at all. It's the least
we could do

01:52.794 --> 01:54.562
for the Seeker on his birthday.

01:54.563 --> 01:56.864
In years past,
this was a day of remembrance

01:56.865 --> 01:58.699
for those slain in the massacre
at Brennidon.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.902
But when we learned you would be
passing so close to Dunshire,

02:01.903 --> 02:04.738
we decided this day shouldn't be
a time of mourning anymore.

02:04.739 --> 02:07.641
From now on, it will be a day
to honor the Seeker

02:07.642 --> 02:09.376
and all he's done
for the Midlands.

02:09.377 --> 02:11.011
(Crowd)
Yeah.

02:11.012 --> 02:13.247
(Anders)
May I introduce my son, Erik.

02:13.248 --> 02:16.317
Would you honor us by leading
the first dance, Seeker?

02:16.318 --> 02:19.920
He'd love to.

02:19.921 --> 02:21.856
( upbeat folk music playing )

02:47.782 --> 02:50.184
Care to join them?

02:50.185 --> 02:52.753
I'd rather fight gars.

03:00.262 --> 03:03.697
( man speaking
in ancient tongue )

03:07.469 --> 03:09.236
Cormac is quite good.

03:09.237 --> 03:11.038
He's a favorite
among the locals.

03:11.039 --> 03:14.275
It's my great pleasure to
perform for our guest of honor,

03:14.276 --> 03:17.611
Richard Cypher.

03:17.612 --> 03:20.314
And may I say what a pleasure
it is to perform

03:20.315 --> 03:23.884
for the Wizard of the First
Order, Zeddicus Z'ul Zorander.

03:23.885 --> 03:28.822
Compared to your magic, all I
have to offer are mere tricks.

03:28.823 --> 03:32.326
But I hope you'll enjoy them
all the same.

03:32.327 --> 03:34.328
<i>Appreataro!</i>

03:34.329 --> 03:36.897
( crowd gasps, claps )

03:36.898 --> 03:40.067
(Cormac)
I'll need a volunteer.

03:40.068 --> 03:41.635
You, my dear.

03:41.636 --> 03:44.305
I don't think so.

03:44.306 --> 03:46.106
Cara, it's a party.

03:46.107 --> 03:47.441
You're supposed to have fun.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.514
( crowd clapping )

03:56.051 --> 03:57.685
I can only hope the Mord'Sith

03:57.686 --> 03:59.653
will not turn my magic
against me.

03:59.654 --> 04:01.956
( crowd laughs )
Just get this over with.

04:01.957 --> 04:04.158
I'll need
another volunteer.

04:04.159 --> 04:07.461
Perhaps the Mother Confessor.

04:07.462 --> 04:08.562
All right.

04:13.969 --> 04:17.971
Now, if you ladies
could step into these boxes...

04:24.246 --> 04:26.180
<i>Appreataro!</i>

04:38.226 --> 04:42.463
Seeker, would you like to see
your friends again?

04:42.464 --> 04:44.765
I'm kind of enjoying
the peace and quiet.

04:46.534 --> 04:49.103
But if you must...
(Cormac) Very well.

04:49.104 --> 04:52.573
But in order to bring them back,
I'll need assistance

04:52.574 --> 04:54.875
from certain members
of the audience.

04:54.876 --> 04:58.312
Will the following gentlemen
please stand?

04:58.313 --> 04:59.947
Gareth J'Tan,

04:59.948 --> 05:02.983
Grayson Logren,

05:02.984 --> 05:04.685
Henrik Katara,

05:04.686 --> 05:07.288
Malcolm Copatar,

05:07.289 --> 05:08.622
and Erik Anders.

05:16.598 --> 05:18.999
If you ever wish to see
the Mother Confessor

05:19.000 --> 05:21.168
and Mord'Sith again, Seeker,

05:21.169 --> 05:24.305
you will kill
these five cowards.

05:24.306 --> 05:25.673
( crowd murmuring )

05:25.674 --> 05:26.740
What did you say?

05:26.741 --> 05:29.943
They will not cheat death again.

05:32.047 --> 05:35.082
Bring Kahlan and Cara back now.

05:35.083 --> 05:37.584
If you kill me,
you'll never find them.

05:39.087 --> 05:42.389
And if these five men
aren't dead within a day,

05:42.390 --> 05:44.692
your friends will be.

05:46.127 --> 05:47.728
Oh, and Seeker.

05:47.729 --> 05:49.963
In case you think
I've forgotten your birthday,

05:49.964 --> 05:51.699
I have a gift for you.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.868
<i>Appreataro!</i>

05:58.907 --> 06:00.441
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

06:00.442 --> 06:03.110
( groans )

06:05.547 --> 06:07.948
Wherever we are, we aren't
getting out this way.

06:13.722 --> 06:15.389
Kahlan.

06:23.798 --> 06:24.865
What does it say?

06:24.866 --> 06:28.769
"You have one day
until the sands run out.

06:28.770 --> 06:31.171
And when they do,
so does your air."

06:34.976 --> 06:39.146
You were right.
This party is lots of fun.

06:41.549 --> 06:43.517
(Zedd)
What is it?

06:45.186 --> 06:47.755
It's a journey book.

06:51.526 --> 06:54.094
"For writing
to your loved ones."

06:54.095 --> 06:56.096
I don't undersnd.

06:56.097 --> 06:58.399
He wants us to write
to Kahlan and Cara.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.868
So we have proof
they're still alive.

07:00.869 --> 07:02.469
He knows Richard
won't do what he wants

07:02.470 --> 07:03.537
if they're already dead.

07:03.538 --> 07:04.671
It might be a trick.

07:04.672 --> 07:07.808
There's one way
to find out

07:07.809 --> 07:10.244
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

07:18.586 --> 07:20.754
There's a message.
It's from Richard.

07:20.755 --> 07:22.089
He wants to know
if we're all right.

07:23.825 --> 07:25.826
(Cara)
Then we'd better write him back.

07:42.243 --> 07:45.579
Your conjurer knows more
than just parlor tricks.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.414
Wandering Dust.

07:47.415 --> 07:49.550
Not something
easy to come by.

07:49.551 --> 07:52.152
It allows the user to magically
transport things

07:52.153 --> 07:53.620
from one place to another.

07:53.621 --> 07:56.423
But no more than a--
A league.

07:56.424 --> 07:57.891
My men are searching
the area.

07:57.892 --> 07:59.860
Why does Cormac
want these five men dead?

08:02.430 --> 08:05.566
He lost five sons in the war
against the D'Harans.

08:05.567 --> 08:07.601
We all mourned his loss.

08:07.602 --> 08:09.536
He was grief-stricken,

08:09.537 --> 08:12.206
but I had no idea he was capable
of something like this.

08:12.207 --> 08:14.041
But what does he have against
the men on the list?

08:15.777 --> 08:17.544
None of us fought in the war.

08:17.545 --> 08:20.747
(Anders)
But they weren't the only ones
who didn't fight.

08:20.748 --> 08:22.416
We have a lottery.

08:22.417 --> 08:25.819
Every eligible man in Dunshire
has a tile with his name on it.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.654
Each year,
in the town square,

08:27.655 --> 08:32.058
the men put their tiles into
a cauldron, and, blindfolded,

08:32.059 --> 08:35.796
I choose the tiles of those
who will serve in our army.

08:35.797 --> 08:38.131
Everyone has the same chance
to be called for service.

08:40.235 --> 08:43.303
I wanted to fight,
but my name was never chosen.

08:43.304 --> 08:45.672
We couldn't allow
all of our sons to fight.

08:45.673 --> 08:49.576
They might all be killed,
much like in Brennidon.

08:49.577 --> 08:51.812
Some men had to survive

08:51.813 --> 08:54.648
to ensure the province
would survive.

08:56.117 --> 08:58.352
Ours is a fair system.

08:58.353 --> 09:00.587
Cormac doesn't seem to agree.

09:00.588 --> 09:04.124
(Zedd)
And he made sure everyone
in Dunshire knows it.

09:04.125 --> 09:05.659
He's quite the showman.

09:05.660 --> 09:07.928
You can't give in
to this madman, Seeker.

09:07.929 --> 09:10.464
You can't kill us.
I'm not killing anyone.

09:10.465 --> 09:12.366
(Zedd)
Richard.

09:12.367 --> 09:15.168
There's a message.

09:17.005 --> 09:20.507
"We're trapped in a tomb with
only a day's worth of air.

09:20.508 --> 09:23.277
"Get us out of here so I can
strangle that old magician

09:23.278 --> 09:24.444
with his own entrails."

09:24.445 --> 09:26.647
That's definitely Cara.

09:26.648 --> 09:28.849
Are there any tombs
within a league of here?

09:28.850 --> 09:30.317
At the necropolis.

09:30.318 --> 09:31.552
Where does Cormac live?

09:31.553 --> 09:34.488
In a cottage
at the edge of the woods.

09:34.489 --> 09:37.457
Go to his house.
Take some men.

09:37.458 --> 09:40.627
See if there's anything that can
help us find Kahlan and Cara.

09:40.628 --> 09:42.563
We're going to the necropolis.

09:42.564 --> 09:44.665
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

09:44.666 --> 09:47.434
(man)
Spread out,
search as many tombs as you can.

09:52.540 --> 09:54.374
(Richard)
There must be
thousands of them.

09:54.375 --> 09:56.677
The necropolis has been here
for centuries.

09:56.678 --> 09:58.478
Hundreds more tombs
were added

09:58.479 --> 10:00.414
over the course of the long
D'Haran war.

10:00.415 --> 10:02.883
We'll do what we can, Seeker.

10:02.884 --> 10:05.385
But I'm not sure we can find
one tomb among so many

10:05.386 --> 10:07.487
before the sands run out.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.919
There's another message
from Richard.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.489
He wants us to look for anything
that'll help him

10:22.490 --> 10:25.024
identify this particular tomb.

10:25.025 --> 10:28.995
An engraving, an inscription...

10:28.996 --> 10:30.964
(Cara)
I'll take this side.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.269
Any luck?

10:36.270 --> 10:38.037
Lt. Rankin's men
are searching the tombs.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.839
But it's gonna take more time
than we have.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.441
I was hoping
you'd found something.

10:41.442 --> 10:45.445
Only the pieces
of a shattered life.

10:45.446 --> 10:49.716
The table is still set
for five sons...

10:49.717 --> 10:51.317
who will never return.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.254
This man lost everything.

10:56.390 --> 10:59.092
Except his grief.

11:04.765 --> 11:05.999
(Rankin)
Medals of valor.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.334
The highest honor we have.

11:08.335 --> 11:12.038
Awarded to those
who died saving others.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.973
These are
their lottery tiles.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.575
( <i>mysterious theme playing</i> )

11:34.995 --> 11:37.030
What is it?

11:37.031 --> 11:38.431
Could I see your tile?

11:43.971 --> 11:45.672
They're the same weight.

11:45.673 --> 11:46.906
Why shouldn't they be?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.309
I held Erik's tile
in my hand.

11:49.310 --> 11:51.744
His was heavier.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.947
There's only one reason
to make some tiles

11:53.948 --> 11:55.381
weigh more than the others...

11:55.382 --> 11:58.084
To know which ones not to pick.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.987
The lottery was rigged.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.690
That's how the same five men
were never chosen.

12:03.691 --> 12:06.993
Fortune didn't smile upon them.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.629
The Duke did.

12:09.630 --> 12:13.900
I served Duke Anders faithfully
all these years,

12:13.901 --> 12:17.237
and risked death every day

12:17.238 --> 12:21.274
in the war against Darken Rahl.

12:21.275 --> 12:23.743
I saw men spill rivers of blood

12:23.744 --> 12:27.280
to keep these lands safe.

12:27.281 --> 12:31.651
All while those privileged brats

12:31.652 --> 12:34.787
let others fight and die
in their place?

12:34.788 --> 12:36.022
( scoffs )

12:36.023 --> 12:39.058
If killing a few cowards
will save the life

12:39.059 --> 12:40.360
of the Mother Confessor,

12:40.361 --> 12:41.794
you should run them through.

12:41.795 --> 12:45.665
I understand your anger,
but I'm not giving in to Cormac.

12:45.666 --> 12:48.101
If we run out of time,
you may not have a choice.

12:48.102 --> 12:50.036
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

12:56.377 --> 12:57.710
Have you found anything?

12:57.711 --> 12:58.912
Nothing.

12:58.913 --> 13:00.847
No marks.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.582
No engravings.

13:02.583 --> 13:06.219
Not even any bones.
It's--

13:06.220 --> 13:08.488
It's all just rock.

13:08.489 --> 13:12.025
We'd better tell Richard
we couldn't find anything.

13:28.075 --> 13:31.411
"We can't find anything
in the tomb."

13:31.412 --> 13:34.981
But of course you can't.

13:34.982 --> 13:38.084
But there's no need
for the Seeker to know that.

13:59.306 --> 14:02.141
Kahlan and Cara
have found something.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.110
It's an engraving.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.645
(Rankin)
That looks like a family crest.

14:05.646 --> 14:08.081
But they haven't used those
since the Third Era.

14:08.082 --> 14:09.949
They must be in one
of the older tombs.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.285
There's a registry of those
tombs in the archives.

14:12.286 --> 14:15.722
If we can find this symbol,
we can find Kahlan and Cara.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.492
(Richard)
This is it.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.834
( grunts )

14:40.014 --> 14:42.448
This crypt is spelled.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.017
Can you open it?

14:44.018 --> 14:46.819
I can try, but it won't be easy.

14:50.824 --> 14:53.259
( chanting in ancient tongue )

15:15.883 --> 15:18.317
(Zedd)
Careful, Richard.
It could be a trap.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.519
(Richard)
Kahlan!

15:19.520 --> 15:22.021
Cara!

15:42.976 --> 15:45.211
It's just a dead body.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.685
Could there be another crypt
with these markings?

15:52.686 --> 15:54.854
(Rankin)
There was only one listed
in the registry.

15:54.855 --> 15:57.323
Could one have been overlooked?
It's possible.

15:57.324 --> 16:00.226
These tombs have been here
thousands of years.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.861
(Richard)
Maybe the markings washed away.

16:01.862 --> 16:04.464
Have your men focus their search
on tombs in this area.

16:07.935 --> 16:09.769
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

16:13.841 --> 16:16.609
(Zedd)
Richard, wait!

16:25.585 --> 16:27.520
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

16:28.715 --> 16:30.116
It's too dark to track it.

16:30.117 --> 16:32.285
I just wish I knew
what "it" was.

16:32.286 --> 16:34.287
I think I do.

16:36.623 --> 16:39.959
This has remnants
of dark sorcery.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.894
The creature is called a Nygaax.

16:41.895 --> 16:42.962
A Nygaax?

16:42.963 --> 16:45.264
According to legend,
in ancient times,

16:45.265 --> 16:47.834
those desperate for revenge
would pay a sorcerer

16:47.835 --> 16:51.003
to wrap a living person
in bandages

16:51.004 --> 16:53.639
infected with long-forgotten
magic, creating a creature

16:53.640 --> 16:56.175
that would carry out
its master's bloodlust.

16:56.176 --> 16:58.578
The Nygaax
is vengeance incarnate.

16:58.579 --> 17:01.247
I've heard stories
of a Nygaax

17:01.248 --> 17:03.850
that terrorized this area.

17:03.851 --> 17:06.051
I thought they were just told
to scare children.

17:06.053 --> 17:07.153
What stories?

17:07.154 --> 17:10.289
Long ago, a feud broke out

17:10.290 --> 17:12.625
between Dunshire's
two most prominent families.

17:12.626 --> 17:16.796
The head of one family employed
a sorcerer to create a Nygaax

17:16.797 --> 17:18.865
that massacred the other family.

17:18.866 --> 17:21.501
The Nygaax claimed its victims
one by one,

17:21.502 --> 17:23.435
and laid them
at its master's feet.

17:23.436 --> 17:25.972
The way the story goes,

17:25.973 --> 17:28.875
the carnage stopped
only when a wizard

17:28.876 --> 17:30.877
sealed the creature in a crypt.

17:30.878 --> 17:34.213
Cormac knew you were
too honorable to kill those men,

17:34.214 --> 17:35.848
so he tricked us
into releasing it.

17:35.849 --> 17:37.316
How do we stop it?

17:37.317 --> 17:40.319
It can't be stopped. Only
controlled by a magical amulet,

17:40.320 --> 17:41.787
which Cormac must have.

17:41.788 --> 17:45.057
And he'll order it to go after
those men on the list.

17:45.058 --> 17:47.627
We have to get to those men
before the Nygaax does.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.334
( Cormac chanting
in ancient tongue )

18:13.687 --> 18:16.255
I have a task for you.

18:19.993 --> 18:21.994
( tapping )

18:21.995 --> 18:23.930
( panting, grunting )

18:26.433 --> 18:27.600
This is pointless.

18:27.601 --> 18:29.569
We've been at it
for hours.

18:29.570 --> 18:31.270
We can't just sit here
and do nothing.

18:31.271 --> 18:33.272
We'll have run out of air

18:33.273 --> 18:35.274
long before we dig our way
out of here.

18:38.679 --> 18:40.813
It's not helping that these
torches are burning air

18:40.814 --> 18:42.148
faster than we are.

18:42.149 --> 18:45.051
Then we'll have to find a way
to snuff them out.

18:48.488 --> 18:50.423
( grunting )

18:56.830 --> 18:58.464
I can almost reach it.

18:58.465 --> 18:59.732
Stand on your toes.

18:59.733 --> 19:01.367
I am.

19:03.604 --> 19:05.871
( yells )

19:07.140 --> 19:09.141
( gasps )

19:11.144 --> 19:12.845
( coughs )

19:12.846 --> 19:14.680
The torches are using less air
than we are

19:14.681 --> 19:15.948
trying to knock them out.

19:15.949 --> 19:18.851
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

19:18.852 --> 19:21.821
Why would Cormac
have done this?

19:21.822 --> 19:24.457
He was always
such a kind soul.

19:24.458 --> 19:27.260
He must've found out
you rigged the lottery.

19:27.261 --> 19:29.695
That's preposterous!

19:33.967 --> 19:35.668
They're made
of lighter metal

19:35.669 --> 19:38.404
than the tiles of the men
on the list.

19:38.405 --> 19:42.375
Which is why they were never
chosen to fight.

19:42.376 --> 19:43.976
Their tiles were heavier,

19:43.977 --> 19:47.613
so you knew which ones
not to draw from the cauldron.

19:47.614 --> 19:48.881
You could feel the difference.

19:55.722 --> 19:58.057
How could you do this?

20:01.328 --> 20:03.629
I loved you too much
to risk losing you.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.831
Did Cormac love his sons
any less?

20:05.832 --> 20:09.969
Erik, you're a virtuous man.

20:09.970 --> 20:12.038
Educated.

20:12.039 --> 20:14.974
One day you will be
a great leader.

20:14.975 --> 20:16.709
Dunshire needs you alive

20:16.710 --> 20:19.779
more than it needs
the son of a conjurer.

20:24.284 --> 20:26.552
I knew Cormac's sons.

20:26.553 --> 20:28.621
They were good men.

20:28.622 --> 20:31.290
And they certainly didn't
deserve to die in my place.

20:31.291 --> 20:35.394
And now your actions may cost
Kahlan and Cara their lives.

20:35.395 --> 20:38.798
How can you judge me,
Wizard?

20:38.799 --> 20:42.301
When you learned of the
impending massacre at Brennidon,

20:42.302 --> 20:45.404
did you save every child
that was in danger?

20:45.405 --> 20:46.772
Of course not.

20:46.773 --> 20:49.408
You saved
the most important one. Him.

20:53.213 --> 20:56.582
It may be distasteful to say,
but it is the truth.

20:56.583 --> 21:01.287
Your life is worth more
than others.

21:01.288 --> 21:03.656
Is it worth more than that
of the Mother Confessor?

21:03.657 --> 21:06.492
Because that's who the Seeker
should be trying to save.

21:06.493 --> 21:07.927
Not us.

21:07.928 --> 21:11.063
We can do both
if we find Cormac.

21:11.064 --> 21:13.899
We'll wait outside
and guard the entrance.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.102
When the Nygaax comes for you
and the others,

21:16.103 --> 21:17.436
we'll be waiting.

21:17.437 --> 21:20.506
There may be a way we can make
it lead us back to Cormac.

21:20.507 --> 21:23.709
Then we can force him to tell us
where Kahlan and Cara are.

21:23.710 --> 21:25.044
But we'll have to do it quickly.

21:25.045 --> 21:26.912
In the meantime,
bar all the doors.

21:26.913 --> 21:28.381
Keep all the men
on the list safe.

21:28.382 --> 21:30.683
That won't be possible.

21:30.684 --> 21:32.718
Henrik didn't trust you, Seeker.

21:32.719 --> 21:34.687
He was afraid you'd kill us

21:34.688 --> 21:36.589
if you were desperate
to save your friends.

21:36.590 --> 21:40.259
So he took a horse and fled.

21:40.260 --> 21:43.462
He could be headed right
into the path of the Nygaax.

21:47.033 --> 21:50.035

22:35.148 --> 22:37.516
No! Please!

22:59.639 --> 23:03.175
Help me.

23:10.016 --> 23:11.317
Thank you for...

23:11.318 --> 23:13.552
saving me
from the creature.

23:18.625 --> 23:20.459
(Zedd)
He's dead.

23:22.229 --> 23:25.464
(Richard)
What did he mean, "thank you for
saving me from the creature"?

23:25.465 --> 23:27.867
(Zedd)
I'm not sure.

23:31.905 --> 23:33.305
Zedd!

23:35.075 --> 23:37.309
Zedd!

23:47.020 --> 23:49.455
Zedd.

23:49.456 --> 23:50.623
Zedd!

23:52.893 --> 23:56.495
( grunting )

23:56.496 --> 23:58.230
Zedd! You can fight this.

24:01.668 --> 24:04.136
Zedd!

24:12.345 --> 24:15.714
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

24:29.637 --> 24:31.571
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

24:33.424 --> 24:35.125
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

24:45.069 --> 24:47.671
(Rankin)
This man survived for centuries?

24:47.672 --> 24:49.339
How is that possible?

24:49.340 --> 24:52.809
The Nygaax's magic
is in the bandages.

24:52.810 --> 24:54.511
They must've kept
this man alive.

24:54.512 --> 24:57.347
Then there's a chance
to save the Wizard.

24:57.348 --> 24:58.382
Yes.

24:58.383 --> 25:00.250
But the bandages only unwrapped

25:00.251 --> 25:02.085
once the man trapped inside
was dying.

25:02.086 --> 25:06.323
We need to find a way to free
Zedd without killing him.

25:06.324 --> 25:07.724
Warn the Duke.

25:07.725 --> 25:09.426
Tell him what happened here.

25:09.427 --> 25:12.763
And if they try to kill the
Nygaax, they'll only kill Zedd.

25:14.198 --> 25:15.432
And Kahlan and Cara?

25:15.433 --> 25:16.767
They don't have much time.

25:16.768 --> 25:18.802
Which is why
we need to find Cormac.

25:18.803 --> 25:20.504
He's the only one who knows
where they are.

25:20.505 --> 25:23.273
We'll follow the creature's
tracks back to him.

25:23.274 --> 25:25.242
How can you be sure it's headed
back to Cormac?

25:25.243 --> 25:27.811
It took Henrik's body.
According to your story,

25:27.812 --> 25:30.247
it lays its victims
at its master's feet.

25:36.988 --> 25:40.057
The Wizard shouldn't have tried
to stop you.

25:40.058 --> 25:42.626
But you've done well.

25:42.627 --> 25:48.365
Now continue your task, and
bring me the other four cowards.

25:48.366 --> 25:50.200
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

26:01.913 --> 26:04.581
The air's getting thinner.

26:08.886 --> 26:12.122
There's one way to double
how long it lasts.

26:16.227 --> 26:18.061
Kill me.

26:20.898 --> 26:23.633
Has the lack of air
driven you mad?

26:23.634 --> 26:26.803
It could give Richard the time
he needs to find us.

26:26.804 --> 26:29.072
And when he does, you can give
me the Breath of Life.

26:31.309 --> 26:35.312
As tempting as the offer
to kill you may be...

26:36.681 --> 26:39.282
Richard would never forgive me
if I let you die.

26:39.283 --> 26:42.119
But I'd only be dead
for a short time.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.787
And then you could
bring me back.

26:43.788 --> 26:44.921
It's too big a risk.

26:44.922 --> 26:46.757
We don't know how long

26:46.758 --> 26:49.159
it's gonna take Richard
to find us.

26:52.230 --> 26:54.898
But there is another way.

26:59.170 --> 27:01.071
I'll die instead.

27:02.373 --> 27:03.673
I can't bring you back.

27:03.674 --> 27:05.876
But you can live.

27:05.877 --> 27:09.613
Cara, no.

27:09.614 --> 27:11.448
If you die
your death would be final.

27:13.684 --> 27:16.186
Better one of us
than both of us.

27:18.723 --> 27:21.491
I'm sorry
I've disappointed you.

27:21.492 --> 27:23.994
But I did what I thought
was best for Dunshire.

27:23.995 --> 27:26.596
And how much did your
rich friends pay you

27:26.597 --> 27:28.765
to keep their sons
out of the army?

27:29.967 --> 27:32.035
So you did do it for money.

27:32.036 --> 27:35.305
What, you think it was for me?

27:35.306 --> 27:39.976
All these years of war against
D'Hara emptied our coffers.

27:39.977 --> 27:43.280
That money was used to equip our
soldiers with weapons and armor.

27:43.281 --> 27:46.116
We didn't stand a chance against
the D'Harans without it.

27:46.117 --> 27:48.518
My parents' gold
bought a lot of steel.

27:48.519 --> 27:50.053
You knew?

27:50.054 --> 27:53.523
Don't be so naive, Erik.

27:53.524 --> 27:55.759
You thought it was
just a coincidence

27:55.760 --> 27:58.195
year after year we were spared?

27:58.196 --> 28:00.897
I thought we were lucky.

28:00.898 --> 28:03.633
We were.
To be born of privilege.

28:04.969 --> 28:08.505
What's done is done.

28:08.506 --> 28:12.008
Just be thankful you're alive--

28:12.009 --> 28:14.678
Please...

28:14.679 --> 28:15.979
( grunting )

28:15.980 --> 28:17.647
Help.

28:23.855 --> 28:25.789
( yelling )

28:27.959 --> 28:29.326
(Erik)
Gareth!

28:29.327 --> 28:31.728
No! No.

28:31.729 --> 28:33.563
No, it's too late.

28:37.068 --> 28:39.669
(Richard)
Don't move.

28:44.375 --> 28:45.876
Where are Kahlan and Cara?

28:45.877 --> 28:47.544
I'll tell you that...

28:47.545 --> 28:49.613
once these graves
are filled.

28:49.614 --> 28:52.015
You got what you wanted.
The Nygaax is free.

28:52.016 --> 28:54.518
Now let Kahlan and Cara go.

28:54.519 --> 28:57.888
I'm sorry, Seeker,
your friends are too powerful.

28:57.889 --> 29:02.192
If I release them, they'll only
help you protect those cowards.

29:02.193 --> 29:04.928
More bloodshed
won't bring your sons back.

29:06.731 --> 29:07.998
They were good boys.

29:10.468 --> 29:14.171
So brave.

29:14.172 --> 29:16.173
They knew Dunshire
didn't stand a chance

29:16.174 --> 29:18.909
against the D'Haran army.

29:18.910 --> 29:23.747
When their tiles were drawn,
I begged them to run away.

29:23.748 --> 29:26.449
But they refused.

29:26.450 --> 29:30.086
They said it was their duty
to keep Dunshire free.

29:30.087 --> 29:32.822
I saw their medals.

29:32.823 --> 29:34.391
They were heroes.

29:34.392 --> 29:37.194
They died
protecting others.

29:39.664 --> 29:43.033
But by threatening the lives
of my friends,

29:43.034 --> 29:45.402
you're dishonoring
what your sons fought for.

29:45.403 --> 29:48.238
If you protect those cowards,
you're doing the same.

29:48.239 --> 29:49.940
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

29:49.941 --> 29:51.408
Don't worry, Seeker.

29:51.409 --> 29:54.044
The blood won't be
on your hands.

29:55.446 --> 29:58.014
And the Nygaax won't be taking
anymore lives, either.

29:58.015 --> 30:01.751
You can't stop it.

30:01.752 --> 30:03.687
I can with this.

30:03.688 --> 30:06.289
I'm afraid not.

30:06.290 --> 30:10.026
Only I know the incantations
which control the Nygaax.

30:10.027 --> 30:12.829
And you're going to tell them
to me.

30:12.830 --> 30:15.065
No.

30:15.066 --> 30:17.934
I'm going to join my sons.

30:17.935 --> 30:20.203
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

30:29.714 --> 30:31.948
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

30:40.375 --> 30:42.109
(Rankin)
What is it?

30:42.110 --> 30:44.345
This must be the Wandering Dust
Cormac used

30:44.346 --> 30:45.880
to abduct Kahlan and Cara.

30:45.881 --> 30:47.481
What if we used it?

30:47.482 --> 30:48.883
Could it take us to them?

30:48.884 --> 30:51.218
If Zedd were here,
he'd know how to use it.

30:51.219 --> 30:52.553
But without the right spell,

30:52.554 --> 30:54.288
who knows where
it would send us.

31:11.907 --> 31:14.275
This is how Cormac
tricked us into thinking

31:14.276 --> 31:17.044
we were writing
to Kahlan and Cara.

31:17.045 --> 31:19.180
He got messages from them
in one book,

31:19.181 --> 31:20.514
and then wrote to us
using the other.

31:26.922 --> 31:28.656
Do you recognize this?

31:28.657 --> 31:30.124
It's a map of the necropolis.

31:30.125 --> 31:32.560
(Richard)
This area is marked.

31:32.561 --> 31:34.895
That must be the tomb
where Kahlan and Cara are.

31:38.967 --> 31:40.201
(Cara)
You were right.

31:42.437 --> 31:43.771
About what?

31:46.808 --> 31:50.077
You once told me
that it's a hard world,

31:50.078 --> 31:53.280
and that we don't get many
chances to tell people

31:53.281 --> 31:55.015
how much they mean to us.

31:59.388 --> 32:02.223
There's no one a Mord'Sith
should hate more

32:02.224 --> 32:04.358
than a Confessor.

32:09.297 --> 32:11.832
I was trained to hate you.

32:15.604 --> 32:17.204
But I don't.

32:20.242 --> 32:23.577
And I don't want to die
without you knowing...

32:26.181 --> 32:30.151
that I consider you
to be my friend.

32:37.793 --> 32:39.660
I think of you
as a friend too.

32:51.440 --> 32:54.608
We're going to get out of here.

32:54.609 --> 32:56.877
We both know Richard.

32:56.878 --> 32:58.846
He's coming for us.

32:58.847 --> 33:00.981
He just needs
a little more time.

33:00.982 --> 33:03.184
I know.

33:03.185 --> 33:06.187
And I'm going to make sure
he gets it.

33:06.188 --> 33:08.189
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

33:08.190 --> 33:10.024
Cara, no!

33:14.062 --> 33:15.396
Get out of my way.

33:15.397 --> 33:20.134
No.

33:20.135 --> 33:22.169
( grunts )

33:24.239 --> 33:26.106
( grunts )

33:28.176 --> 33:30.778
( both grunting )

33:51.766 --> 33:55.703
Stop pretending my life
means as much as yours.

34:12.853 --> 34:14.922
Line the hall
and connect each fuse

34:14.922 --> 34:16.322
so that they run
into the courtyard.

34:16.324 --> 34:18.993
And hurry!
We don't have much time!

34:22.264 --> 34:23.831
What are you doing?

34:23.831 --> 34:26.166
Dragon's Breath?

34:26.167 --> 34:28.202
We know the Nygaax
will be coming back

34:28.203 --> 34:29.803
for the rest of the men
on the list.

34:29.804 --> 34:32.373
But to get inside, the creature
must come through here.

34:32.373 --> 34:35.576
And when it does,
those doors will be barricaded

34:35.577 --> 34:37.277
and sealed with mortar.

34:37.279 --> 34:39.246
The Nygaax will be trapped
in here,

34:39.246 --> 34:40.947
and then we'll blow it
into the underworld.

34:40.949 --> 34:42.949
But you'll kill the Wizard
along with it.

34:42.951 --> 34:45.085
Yes, but you'll be safe.

34:45.085 --> 34:47.154
These men are going to take you
far from this place.

34:47.155 --> 34:48.556
But you must leave now.

34:48.556 --> 34:50.190
I won't go along with this.

34:50.190 --> 34:52.927
I'm not giving you a choice.

35:04.205 --> 35:07.074
Come.
You'll be safe inside.

35:11.780 --> 35:13.280
( Kahlan and Cara gasping )

35:15.717 --> 35:19.687
There's...no air...

35:19.688 --> 35:21.589
left.

35:49.460 --> 35:51.395
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

( wind blowing )

36:02.571 --> 36:05.573
Kahlan!

36:05.574 --> 36:07.776
Cara!

36:07.777 --> 36:10.245
Are you all right?

36:10.246 --> 36:12.914
We are now.

36:12.915 --> 36:17.452
I knew you'd find us
in time.

36:19.088 --> 36:20.522
I'm fine.

36:23.225 --> 36:24.959
Where's Zedd?

36:24.960 --> 36:26.895
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

36:35.371 --> 36:36.604
Go, go.

36:51.253 --> 36:54.222
Quick, the fuse. Light it. Now.

36:54.223 --> 36:56.157
( banging on door )

36:59.595 --> 37:03.031
If we have such a long journey
ahead of us,

37:03.032 --> 37:05.800
can I at least have
a drink of water?

37:09.739 --> 37:11.806
( grunting )

37:15.578 --> 37:17.512
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

37:23.686 --> 37:25.286
( grunting )

37:25.287 --> 37:27.489
Get away from the door!

37:34.130 --> 37:36.331
The Seeker.

37:36.332 --> 37:39.434
Seeker, you have to get away
from here.

37:39.435 --> 37:41.669
We've trapped the Nygaax.

37:41.670 --> 37:43.772
We're going to destroy it
with Dragon's Breath.

37:43.773 --> 37:45.173
You'll kill Zedd!

37:46.408 --> 37:47.842
Stop him!

37:47.843 --> 37:49.210
( grunting )

37:54.216 --> 37:56.151
Put your weapons down.

37:56.152 --> 37:58.052
You heard the Mother Confessor.
Do it.

38:05.060 --> 38:07.295
If the person inside
the bandages is dying,

38:07.296 --> 38:08.830
they'll urap themselves.

38:08.831 --> 38:10.231
If you use your Agiels
to bring Zedd

38:10.232 --> 38:12.233
to the brink of death,
he'll be freed.

38:12.234 --> 38:13.768
The bandages can't attack
a Mord'Sith.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.637
You repel their magic.

38:15.638 --> 38:17.739
And once Zedd's free,
maybe he can burn them.

38:26.849 --> 38:28.683

Cara, now!

( Agiels whining )

38:46.368 --> 38:48.536
Make sure you don't kill him!

No! We must kill it.

are you all right?

Erik, get out of here!

39:25.708 --> 39:26.975
It wants me.

39:26.976 --> 39:28.443
It'll follow me
back to the crypt.

39:28.444 --> 39:30.044
Seal us inside and end this!

be freed again.

40:46.121 --> 40:48.122
I'm sorry about your father,
Erik.

40:48.123 --> 40:52.293
You should have let it
kill me.

40:52.294 --> 40:54.228
And what would that have
accomplished?

40:57.032 --> 40:59.500
My debt would be paid to those
who died in my place.

40:59.501 --> 41:03.104
But your people would be left
without a leader.

41:03.105 --> 41:05.773
How can I lead?

41:05.774 --> 41:07.642
The people won't follow
a coward.

41:07.643 --> 41:10.678
No. They won't.

41:12.715 --> 41:15.550
But they will follow a man who
is willing to sacrifice himself

41:15.551 --> 41:16.784
to save others.

41:26.628 --> 41:28.563
( <i>upbeat theme playing</i> )

41:31.867 --> 41:34.702
You were wrong before.

41:34.703 --> 41:36.004
Back in the tomb.

41:36.005 --> 41:39.440
Your life is just
as important as mine is.

41:39.441 --> 41:41.509
If it weren't for you,

41:41.510 --> 41:43.911
we wouldn't have been able
to free Zedd from the Nygaax.

41:46.315 --> 41:48.016
About what I said
back in the tomb...

41:48.017 --> 41:52.353
It-- It really meant
a lot to me.

41:52.354 --> 41:53.755
Forget I said it.

41:53.756 --> 41:55.690
I was delirious
from the lack of air.

42:02.765 --> 42:04.932
Is she all right?

42:04.933 --> 42:07.235
She's...Cara.

a night of fun.
