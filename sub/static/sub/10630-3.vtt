47:45.071 --> 47:47.528
I don't deserve to die.

47:49.326 --> 47:51.533
I'm safe.

47:53.705 --> 47:55.536
So you can help me catch him.

47:56.750 --> 47:59.787
-I'm not a cop, Sarah.
-Better. You're a murderer.

48:09.429 --> 48:12.216
You know how all the colors
in the rainbow,

48:12.223 --> 48:13.929
if you shine them together,

48:13.933 --> 48:18.017
they produce a pure white light?

48:18.021 --> 48:19.386
Yeah?

48:19.397 --> 48:22.480
Lust, gluttony, greed,

48:22.484 --> 48:25.976
sloth, wrath, envy...

48:25.987 --> 48:29.650
They all come together
to form darkness.

48:29.657 --> 48:33.741
The cardinal sin, pride.

48:33.745 --> 48:36.452
Whoever's doing this
is blinded by their own pride,

48:36.456 --> 48:40.244
and pride will be their downfall.

48:40.251 --> 48:42.333
-How?

48:42.337 --> 48:45.579
TOM: The Executioner
is lost in zealotry,

48:45.590 --> 48:47.751
in playing God,

48:47.759 --> 48:49.295
in pride...

48:49.302 --> 48:55.514
But pride can blind us
and cause us to make mistakes.

48:56.226 --> 48:59.935
And one day soon,
The Executioner will slip,

49:01.940 --> 49:05.899
and that's all it'll take
for you to catch your killer.
