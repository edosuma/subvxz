01:19.417 --> 01:24.087
Sometimes people have a connection
That just can't be explained.

01:24.139 --> 01:28.208
- Why fight it?
- Because you know my uncle doesn't like you!

01:28.226 --> 01:30.144
You know what he'll do!

01:30.178 --> 01:32.629
Let me worry about your uncle.

01:34.715 --> 01:36.567
You just worry about me.

01:38.603 --> 01:41.188
Don't look, turtle.

01:41.222 --> 01:43.190
It's gonna be over soon.

01:44.692 --> 01:47.444
Oh, jesus.

01:47.478 --> 01:49.496
You know when they say a guy
can never bang his girl again

01:49.531 --> 01:50.981
After he watches her give birth?

01:51.015 --> 01:52.666
<i>That is what this is like.</i>

01:52.700 --> 01:55.802
Okay, and cut! Cut the rain. Beautiful.

01:55.837 --> 01:58.705
<i>I want to do a lighting change.
We'll pick this up in 30.</i>

01:58.739 --> 02:00.707
You're gonna do more takes?

02:00.741 --> 02:02.843
I'm sorry. I just thought you had it.

02:02.877 --> 02:04.845
<i>All right, everybody. We've got 30 minutes.</i>

02:04.879 --> 02:06.630
- Hey!
- How was that?

02:06.681 --> 02:09.216
- Fantastic.
- That wasn't so bad, right?

02:09.250 --> 02:11.451
That was the worst thing
I've ever seen in my life.

02:11.486 --> 02:13.020
Stop it.

02:13.054 --> 02:14.538
Eww! It's like you just kissed me.

02:14.572 --> 02:16.490
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

02:16.524 --> 02:18.058
I've got to go into makeup. Can you stay?

02:18.092 --> 02:20.878
- Class starts in an hour.
- Good luck, college man.

02:20.912 --> 02:23.597
- Call me later.
- Eww! You just kissed me again.

02:23.631 --> 02:25.765
<i>- You're gonna get hit, drama.
- Go ahead.</i>

02:25.783 --> 02:28.368
Don't break your hand on my pythons.

02:28.403 --> 02:30.237
- Yo!
- Yo, e, where you been?

02:30.271 --> 02:32.239
- You missed everything.
- Sorry, rough night.

02:32.273 --> 02:33.824
Why? What happened?

02:33.875 --> 02:36.076
Where can I get some coffee?

02:36.110 --> 02:39.162
You called ashley sloan and
you weren't even in mid-fuck?

02:39.214 --> 02:42.299
Oh, that's the worst. That's why
I always stick with "yeah, baby!"

02:42.333 --> 02:44.784
Whose name would you
accidentally call out? Vince's?

02:44.802 --> 02:47.621
- So how'd you cover?
- I told her she was hearing things.

02:47.639 --> 02:49.273
- Jesus.
- I bet she took that well.

02:49.307 --> 02:51.008
- Yeah, she left.
- Who wouldn't?

02:51.042 --> 02:53.377
- Why didn't you chase after her?
- 'Cause he loves sloan.

02:53.411 --> 02:55.262
- Ah.
- Why else would a sober man

02:55.296 --> 02:57.514
Who isn't about to come
do something so stupid?

02:57.565 --> 03:00.851
I was distracted thinking about the job.

03:00.885 --> 03:02.853
I wasn't expecting an offer to come so fast

03:02.887 --> 03:04.221
Or how vince would feel about it.

03:04.255 --> 03:05.689
Hey, don't blame me. I feel fine.

03:05.740 --> 03:07.224
I think you knew you wanted the job.

03:07.258 --> 03:08.759
You just didn't want to be sloan's bitch.

03:08.793 --> 03:11.478
He's already vince's bitch. It suits him.

03:11.496 --> 03:13.981
I appreciate that, turtle...
from one bitch to another.

03:14.015 --> 03:15.616
I am no longer a bitch.

03:15.650 --> 03:17.784
After today, I am a college man...

03:17.819 --> 03:19.453
If I could focus.

03:19.487 --> 03:21.989
Relax, turtle. Your girl is in good hands.

03:22.023 --> 03:24.958
Just send her back as untainted
as possible. I've gotta go.

03:24.993 --> 03:27.628
Yo, e. Do you want to hang
before your meeting with murray

03:27.662 --> 03:30.163
- Or should I go with turtle?
- Nah, I think I'm gonna go talk to ashley.

03:30.198 --> 03:31.848
- You mean sloan.
- Funny.

03:31.883 --> 03:33.717
- So what are you going to say to her?
- I don't know yet.

03:33.768 --> 03:36.303
- Let me give you some advice.
- Oh, please do, drama.

03:36.337 --> 03:38.956
I know you like to think of
yourself as honest abe and all,

03:38.990 --> 03:42.809
But in this situation, lie like a mattress.

03:51.286 --> 03:52.869
What are you doing, buddy?

03:52.904 --> 03:55.122
I'm waking you up with my mind.

03:55.156 --> 03:56.907
Good work.

03:56.958 --> 03:59.993
- What time is it?
- It's late.

04:00.027 --> 04:02.212
Shoot.

04:02.246 --> 04:04.114
Daddy, you almost said shit.

04:06.084 --> 04:08.051
Baby.

04:09.704 --> 04:11.588
Baby, please.

04:11.639 --> 04:14.040
I'm sorry.

04:14.058 --> 04:16.593
What do I got to do for you to forgive me?

04:16.644 --> 04:19.262
- Not get me a car.
- It's nice, though, isn't it?

04:19.314 --> 04:22.399
- It's insulting.
- Baby, I ache.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.601
I haven't been able to look left in days.

04:24.652 --> 04:26.269
I can't work. I can't sleep.

04:26.321 --> 04:29.222
- It's cold down there.
- Oh, what a shame.

04:29.257 --> 04:32.225
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied to you.

04:32.243 --> 04:34.745
Listen, from here on I swear

04:34.779 --> 04:36.997
If one of my friends so much as jerks off

04:37.031 --> 04:38.398
You're gonna be the first to know.

04:38.416 --> 04:40.900
- I appreciate that.
- So you forgive me?

04:40.918 --> 04:43.086
- I'm thinking about it.
- When I was in college

04:43.121 --> 04:44.454
I got drunk and passed out.

04:44.505 --> 04:46.506
Mike young teabagged me
and took a picture of it.

04:46.541 --> 04:48.642
I've never told anyone.

04:48.676 --> 04:50.010
Where's the picture?

04:50.044 --> 04:52.295
I've offered millions for
it and been turned down.

04:54.915 --> 04:58.101
- I forgive you.
- So I can get back in bed?

04:58.136 --> 04:59.936
I just made that bed.

04:59.971 --> 05:02.856
I'll remake it. Come here and punish me.

05:02.890 --> 05:07.144
<i>It is a very nice car.</i>

05:08.446 --> 05:10.714
- Oh.
- What are you guys doing?

05:10.748 --> 05:13.533
Um, daddy lost his contact lens.

05:13.568 --> 05:15.952
- We're looking for it. I think
it's over here. - Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:15.987 --> 05:18.155
You guys are gross.

05:28.916 --> 05:31.451
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:31.486 --> 05:34.721
- Can I come in for a second?
- I was actually just about to run out.

05:34.756 --> 05:37.174
- I just need one second.
- Okay.

05:37.225 --> 05:39.059
I wish you would've called.

05:39.093 --> 05:41.812
<i>I've got just a million things to do.</i>

05:41.846 --> 05:44.464
- Well, I just wanted to apologize.
- For what?

05:44.482 --> 05:47.918
- Well, I'm sorry I called you sloan.
- Oh, you did call me sloan?

05:47.952 --> 05:50.771
- I thought I was hearing things.
- Well, you weren't, so...

05:50.805 --> 05:53.407
'cause that's what you told me last
night... that I was hearing things.

05:53.441 --> 05:54.775
I know what I told you.

05:54.809 --> 05:57.160
It was embarrassing enough that you said it,

05:57.195 --> 06:00.747
But you made it worse when you
tried to convince me that you didn't.

06:00.782 --> 06:03.250
Well, I'm sorry.

06:03.284 --> 06:05.819
- Why were you thinking about her?
- I don't know.

06:05.853 --> 06:07.788
Probably because she called the day before.

06:07.822 --> 06:10.323
Well, why did she call? What did she want?

06:10.341 --> 06:12.375
I have no idea. You were right
there. You heard the whole thing.

06:12.427 --> 06:14.261
I heard your side.

06:14.295 --> 06:17.180
I really hate being put in a position

06:17.215 --> 06:19.216
- To be a jealous freak.
- You're not.

06:19.267 --> 06:21.301
<i>- But I just want to know.
- What do you want to know?</i>

06:21.335 --> 06:22.719
Have you been with her
since you've been with me?

06:22.770 --> 06:25.055
- Have I been with her?
- Have you slept with her, eric?

06:25.106 --> 06:27.507
- Come on.
- What?! Ashley, no.

06:27.525 --> 06:29.843
No, I swear to god. Look, she called.

06:29.861 --> 06:32.395
<i>Before that, I hadn't seen
her since the premiere.</i>

06:32.447 --> 06:34.364
Okay.

06:34.398 --> 06:35.899
Yeah?

06:38.486 --> 06:40.437
Yeah, okay.

06:42.123 --> 06:44.324
I like you, eric.

06:44.358 --> 06:47.193
- I like you a lot.
- Well, I like you too.

06:47.211 --> 06:50.029
- But just don't lie to me.
- I won't.

06:50.047 --> 06:51.832
I'm sorry.

06:51.866 --> 06:54.501
You're really cute when you're sorry.

06:54.535 --> 06:57.420
Well, then I'm really real.

06:57.472 --> 06:59.806
You have a meeting.

06:59.841 --> 07:02.175
I have an hour.

07:02.209 --> 07:04.377
Well, in that case.

07:04.395 --> 07:08.148
But you so much as mutter anything
resembling that bitch's name

07:08.182 --> 07:10.650
- And I will hurt you.
- Oh, not a problem.

07:14.272 --> 07:17.223
And cut! That was great!

07:17.241 --> 07:19.109
<i>- That was great.
- Huh! Whoo!</i>

07:19.160 --> 07:21.394
- How was that one?
- That was good.

07:21.412 --> 07:23.062
- Better?
- Yeah, definitely.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.499
You can tell me. I can
handle a little criticism.

07:25.533 --> 07:28.585
Your tongue's kind of strong.

07:28.619 --> 07:31.237
- Really?
- It's no big deal.

07:31.255 --> 07:34.124
It's just my teeth are a little sore.

07:34.175 --> 07:35.959
I'll relax on this one.

07:36.010 --> 07:37.928
- I think we got it.
- Yeah?

07:37.962 --> 07:40.514
I love the passion on that take.

07:40.548 --> 07:42.382
Jamie didn't feel great about that one.

07:42.416 --> 07:44.968
- No? Let's do another one.
- No no no, I'm great.

07:45.019 --> 07:46.920
You think we've got it, tim, let's move on.

07:46.938 --> 07:49.105
- It was great for me. Great, let's move on.
- Great.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.590
- Timmy!
- Hey, dan.

07:50.625 --> 07:52.058
- How are you?
- How are you? You see that take?

07:52.093 --> 07:53.660
Oh, yeah yeah, it looked good.

07:53.694 --> 07:55.345
Well, as good as one can
look kissing johnny chase.

07:55.379 --> 07:57.280
- Mr. Coakley.
- How are you, johnny?

07:57.315 --> 07:59.533
What brings you down here
to our little operation?

07:59.567 --> 08:01.785
Well, I heard miss sigler
had graced us with her talent.

08:01.819 --> 08:03.269
I wanted to come down and say hello.

08:03.287 --> 08:05.271
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm dan coakley.

08:05.289 --> 08:07.624
- I'm a big fan.
- And the boss.

08:07.658 --> 08:10.493
- Oh. Hi, nice to meet you.
- And you as well.

08:10.545 --> 08:12.495
Yeah, I was surprised we were
able to get you to do this.

08:12.547 --> 08:15.782
- Well, johnny's a friend.
- Terrific.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.051
Well, I love what I saw

08:18.085 --> 08:20.887
And I've got a couple of things
I'd love to talk with you about,

08:20.922 --> 08:23.957
<i>- If that's okay.
- Um, yeah, sure.</i>

08:23.975 --> 08:25.692
All right. Timmy, how clo are you?

08:25.726 --> 08:27.644
- As soon as we light the shot.
- Okay.

08:27.678 --> 08:29.963
- Can I take you to lunch?
- Yeah.

08:29.981 --> 08:31.848
Jawould have lunch. Maybe you and I

08:31.899 --> 08:34.034
<i>You guys are friends. You can lunch anytime.</i>

08:34.068 --> 08:36.186
Jamie and I have to talk
about our future together.

08:36.236 --> 08:40.023
Sounds serious. Do I need
my agent or my lawyer?

08:40.073 --> 08:42.958
Or your bodyguard.

08:44.695 --> 08:46.980
If you like anything I have,
we can call your people after.

08:46.998 --> 08:49.482
Okay. Johnny, are you okay?

08:49.500 --> 08:52.168
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

08:52.203 --> 08:54.120
Let me just get cleaned
up. I'll meet you back here.

08:54.154 --> 08:55.672
Okay, great.

09:00.294 --> 09:03.463
So, dan, you still seeing
that chick from "lost"?

09:03.497 --> 09:05.265
I got rid of her before the island did, john.

09:05.299 --> 09:07.133
I was hitting that cutie
on "brothers & sisters."

09:07.167 --> 09:09.469
Not sally field?

09:09.503 --> 09:12.689
No, john, not sally field.

09:17.578 --> 09:19.846
Maybe we could have office phone sex, baby.

09:19.864 --> 09:21.581
Haven't done that since the early '90s.

09:21.616 --> 09:23.216
You have glass doors.

09:23.250 --> 09:24.784
<i>Yeah, it'll be lloyd's year-end bonus.</i>

09:24.819 --> 09:26.853
<i>He'd rather that than cash. Trust me.</i>

09:26.871 --> 09:29.422
You're disgusting.

09:29.457 --> 09:32.325
Too disgusting to spend a
couple of nights in cabo with?

09:32.359 --> 09:35.979
God, ari, this fight has
made you very romantic.

09:36.013 --> 09:37.497
I love you so much right now

09:37.531 --> 09:39.149
I may even let you play golf with me.

09:39.183 --> 09:40.934
Maybe we should fight more often.

09:40.968 --> 09:44.203
No more fights. Smooth
sailing from here on out.

09:44.221 --> 09:46.990
Where's the whore who is fucking my husband?!

09:47.024 --> 09:49.376
Huh?! Where are you, whore?!

09:49.410 --> 09:52.228
- What about you? Are you fucking my husband?!
- Baby, I'll call you back.

09:52.263 --> 09:55.381
<i>Where is she?! What's her name?!</i>

09:55.399 --> 09:58.885
- Mr. Gold... mr. Gold, I think we
have a problem. - No shit, lloyd.

09:58.903 --> 10:01.154
What about you?

10:01.188 --> 10:04.157
Are you the whore who's fucking my husband?

10:04.191 --> 10:05.508
Who's your husband?

10:05.543 --> 10:06.843
- Marlo.
- Where is she, ari?

10:06.877 --> 10:08.728
- Come on.
- Where is the nasty slut

10:08.746 --> 10:11.431
Who is fucking my worthless
piece of shit husband?

10:11.465 --> 10:13.333
<i>Come on, let's go talk in my office.</i>

10:13.367 --> 10:15.702
- Please. Come on.
- Come on out, you skank!

10:15.736 --> 10:17.403
- Come here. Come here.
- Where is she?

10:17.421 --> 10:19.405
- Sit down.
- I want to look her in the eye

10:19.423 --> 10:21.424
And I want to ask her

10:21.459 --> 10:23.760
What she wants with my husband.

10:23.794 --> 10:27.246
- Okay, just take a breath.
- Why? Are you protecting her?

10:27.264 --> 10:29.265
- No.
- Oh my god!

10:29.300 --> 10:31.250
Are you fucking her too?

10:31.268 --> 10:33.703
Is this some kind of sick threesome?

10:33.738 --> 10:35.605
Because unlike your lying ass,

10:35.639 --> 10:37.507
I will tell your wife!

10:37.541 --> 10:39.726
Just keep my wife out of this.
This is between you and andrew.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.260
Oh, you got involved

10:41.278 --> 10:43.947
When you advised him to follow his dick!

10:43.981 --> 10:46.282
Now I want you to point me in the direction

10:46.317 --> 10:48.568
And tell me where she is!

10:48.602 --> 10:51.938
- I can't do that.
- Well, I'll find her eventually.

10:51.956 --> 10:54.591
I see about 12 candidates already.

10:54.625 --> 10:57.777
This is some whorehouse you are running.

10:57.795 --> 11:01.197
- Listen, marlo... -
15 years in the valley

11:01.232 --> 11:04.050
And andrew never worked with anyone under 50.

11:04.085 --> 11:06.503
Listen, this is just a
terrible misunderstanding.

11:06.554 --> 11:08.922
All right, marlo? Calm down.

11:08.956 --> 11:11.508
You ruined my family, ari.

11:12.643 --> 11:15.111
I want my family back.

11:15.146 --> 11:17.313
You didn't lose them.
Go home to your children.

11:17.348 --> 11:20.100
- Let me talk to andrew.
- You've done enough talking.

11:20.134 --> 11:21.735
Let me try again. I've known him long enough

11:21.769 --> 11:23.403
To know this is just a crisis of character.

11:23.437 --> 11:26.189
He loves his family. He wants to be with you.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.641
You have to calm down
and work on forgiving him.

11:28.659 --> 11:31.094
Oh, he fucks up and I have to work?

11:36.083 --> 11:38.635
What are you looking at, bitch? Keep walking!

11:38.669 --> 11:40.870
Where's andrew?

11:40.905 --> 11:43.339
I don't know. Lizzie's office?

11:43.374 --> 11:46.526
Find them both now!

11:49.130 --> 11:52.015
Use the mint soap so you don't
smell like girl for the interview.

11:52.049 --> 11:54.234
It's not an interview. It's an offer.

11:54.268 --> 11:55.852
Sorry, hotshot.

11:55.886 --> 11:58.221
Your offer, which you
still seem hesitant to take.

11:58.272 --> 12:00.774
I just want to make sure he wants me for me.

12:00.808 --> 12:03.476
- And not for vince, you mean.
- There's that.

12:03.510 --> 12:05.278
What else is there?

12:05.312 --> 12:07.530
I don't know.

12:07.565 --> 12:09.315
Have some confidence, eric.

12:09.349 --> 12:11.367
You are very wonderful.

12:11.402 --> 12:14.204
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:19.376 --> 12:21.694
<i>Hey, you have an extra toothbrush?</i>

12:21.712 --> 12:24.330
No, sorry.

12:29.553 --> 12:32.538
<i>Hey, e. Look, I'm so sorry about yesterday.</i>

12:32.556 --> 12:34.040
<i>I didn't mean to be pushy.</i>

12:34.058 --> 12:35.642
<i>If you don't want the job, don't take it.</i>

12:35.676 --> 12:37.210
<i>But I hope you think about it</i>

12:37.228 --> 12:39.062
<i>'cause I think it could
be really great for you.</i>

12:39.096 --> 12:42.381
<i>Anyway, good to see you. Okay, bye.</i>

12:42.399 --> 12:45.602
<i>End of message. To delete
this message press 7.</i>

12:45.653 --> 12:48.488
<i>Hey, could you throw me a towel?</i>

12:54.394 --> 12:56.729
Ashley?

13:00.467 --> 13:03.503
Oh. Maybe I should go back to school.

13:03.537 --> 13:05.572
It does look fun, right?

13:05.606 --> 13:07.674
Hey.

13:17.484 --> 13:19.052
<i>- How's it going?
- Sweet car.</i>

13:19.086 --> 13:21.821
- Thanks, man.
- Hey, I know you.

13:21.856 --> 13:24.073
I don't think you do.

13:24.108 --> 13:26.226
Yeah, you're jamie-lynn sigler's boyfriend.

13:26.260 --> 13:28.978
<i>- Saw you in "people."
- Oh yeah, that's right. I saw that too.</i>

13:29.029 --> 13:31.564
I love it. You're a star, turtle.

13:31.599 --> 13:33.867
Holy shit. Vince. Man, what's up?

13:33.901 --> 13:35.451
- Not much.
- What are you doing here?

13:35.486 --> 13:37.287
Just taking my son to school.

13:37.321 --> 13:39.372
- That's so cool.
- Sweet.

13:39.406 --> 13:41.541
All right, I've got to head
in. What are you gonna do?

13:41.575 --> 13:43.693
Well, I've got an hour.

13:43.727 --> 13:45.879
So I'll mingle.

13:45.913 --> 13:47.814
All right.

13:50.617 --> 13:52.986
You miss me already, johnny? I just left you.

13:53.020 --> 13:55.004
<i>I got a problem, bro. You got a minute?</i>

13:55.039 --> 13:56.573
<i>Yeah sure, what's wrong?</i>

13:56.607 --> 13:58.408
Is turtle near you?

13:58.442 --> 14:00.610
<i>No, he just left for class.</i>

14:00.644 --> 14:02.629
My boss is trying to bang jamie.

14:02.663 --> 14:04.964
- What?
- I tried to stop him, bro.

14:04.999 --> 14:06.983
- But he wooed her.
- Wooed her how?

14:07.017 --> 14:08.835
He's a real smooth talker, this guy,

14:08.869 --> 14:10.954
And real good looking.
And he fucks actresses.

14:10.988 --> 14:13.323
<i>- What actresses?
- All of them.</i>

14:13.357 --> 14:15.808
Not jamie. She's not that kind of girl.

14:15.843 --> 14:17.744
She jerked turtle on a plane.

14:17.778 --> 14:19.829
Johnny, calm down. Take a deep breath.

14:19.863 --> 14:22.481
<i>- Nothing's gonna happen.
- Not on my watch it ain't.</i>

14:22.499 --> 14:24.183
Johnny.

14:24.218 --> 14:26.686
Gotta go. Gotta go.

14:28.289 --> 14:30.373
I've got 45 minutes till class.

14:30.424 --> 14:33.626
- You wanna hang?
- Yeah.

14:33.661 --> 14:37.063
<i>Mr. Gold, miss grant and mr.
Klein are here to see you.</i>

14:37.097 --> 14:40.617
55 minutes it took lloyd to find you.

14:40.651 --> 14:42.936
Humor me, tell me where you were.

14:42.970 --> 14:45.855
Fucking in the bathroom,
blowing him under his desk?

14:45.889 --> 14:48.057
Ari, I don't wish to be spoken to like this.

14:48.108 --> 14:51.995
And I don't wish to have to worry about
where you are and what you're doing.

14:52.029 --> 14:53.463
You don't have to.

14:53.497 --> 14:55.248
That's right, I don't.

14:55.282 --> 14:57.216
Because you're fired, both of you.

14:57.251 --> 14:58.635
- What? Why?
- Ari.

14:58.669 --> 15:00.954
Did you not hear about his wife

15:00.988 --> 15:02.722
Providing us with this
morning's entertainment?

15:02.756 --> 15:05.742
- I was out working.
- Working who?

15:05.793 --> 15:08.194
John stamos. And I signed him.

15:08.228 --> 15:09.729
With a pen or his cock?

15:09.763 --> 15:12.031
Ari, don't talk to me like that.

15:12.066 --> 15:14.417
Whatever. It doesn't matter who you signed.

15:14.451 --> 15:16.269
<i>You both are unquestionably
good at what you do.</i>

15:16.303 --> 15:18.588
But call me old fashioned,

15:18.639 --> 15:21.207
This won't work for me. Not in my office.

15:21.241 --> 15:24.444
There is no more of this. Tell him.

15:25.779 --> 15:27.664
- Tell him.
- There is no more.

15:27.698 --> 15:29.682
- It's over.
- She ended it.

15:29.716 --> 15:32.251
I left my wife, I left my family,

15:32.286 --> 15:34.654
- I gave up everything.
- I didn't ask you to.

15:34.688 --> 15:36.555
In fact, I told you not to.

15:36.573 --> 15:37.824
I love her. I love you.

15:37.858 --> 15:40.159
You barely know me. Grow up.

15:40.194 --> 15:42.895
Ari, I heard your warning

15:42.930 --> 15:46.299
And I have done everything since
then to make this mistake disappear.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.835
<i>How can you call it a mistake?</i>

15:48.869 --> 15:50.753
I would like to go back to my desk now.

15:50.788 --> 15:52.672
I'd like to go do my job.

15:52.706 --> 15:54.524
Go.

15:54.558 --> 15:57.093
You so much as eye-fuck
another agent in this building,

15:57.127 --> 16:00.013
I will deport you naked to the taliban.

16:00.047 --> 16:03.316
Oh, I thought we really had something.

16:04.768 --> 16:07.203
You weak pathetic pussy.

16:07.237 --> 16:08.805
I was never a weak man.

16:08.856 --> 16:11.491
This transition,
this... god!

16:11.525 --> 16:14.577
- It's just broken me.
- You're breaking me.

16:14.611 --> 16:17.764
Ari, don't fire me, okay?

16:17.798 --> 16:19.499
You know how well I'm doing.

16:19.533 --> 16:22.118
You look great.

16:22.152 --> 16:25.771
Last night was rough.
Marlo froze all my assets,

16:25.789 --> 16:28.775
My credit cards. I couldn't get $5.

16:28.809 --> 16:31.944
Lizzie wouldn't take me
in. I slept in my car.

16:31.962 --> 16:34.247
Thank god we live in I.A. It's 70°.

16:35.883 --> 16:38.284
I don't... I don't know
where I'm gonna go.

16:38.318 --> 16:41.771
- Go home.
- Come on, marlo would never have me.

16:41.805 --> 16:43.556
<i>Actually, she would.</i>

16:43.590 --> 16:47.343
One in very few guys get that
have-a-free- piece-of-pussy pass.

16:47.394 --> 16:49.729
You, my friend, have it.

16:49.763 --> 16:51.297
Marlo wants you back.

16:51.331 --> 16:53.032
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:53.067 --> 16:55.151
I don't know. I don't know.

16:55.185 --> 16:57.487
- I don't know if I
could ever... - andrew!

16:57.521 --> 16:59.822
There was a time when marlo made you smile.

16:59.857 --> 17:02.742
Remember that time. Remind her of it.

17:02.776 --> 17:05.011
And if that doesn't work you do
what every other married man does,

17:05.045 --> 17:07.113
Think of someone else when you fuck her.

17:07.146 --> 17:10.282
But get it together, for
yourself, for your kids.

17:10.317 --> 17:13.869
Most importantly, for me. Andrew, go home.

17:13.921 --> 17:16.506
You have no other options.

17:18.826 --> 17:22.161
Hey, ashley. It's me again.

17:22.179 --> 17:24.931
Listen, I'm freaking out a little bit.

17:24.964 --> 17:26.598
I just... I don't
really under...

17:26.633 --> 17:28.718
Understand where you went.

17:28.769 --> 17:30.987
Would you call me, please?

17:31.021 --> 17:32.605
Eric, fuck off!

17:36.560 --> 17:39.529
I think my girlfriend
just told me to fuck off.

17:39.563 --> 17:42.014
<i>- Ouch, bro.
- Yeah.</i>

17:42.032 --> 17:45.017
Hey, eric, did you meet
the incomparable steve nash?

17:45.035 --> 17:47.036
- We were just getting acquainted.
- How are you doing?

17:47.070 --> 17:49.272
I'm courting eric to be our newest manager.

17:49.306 --> 17:52.458
- It's a great place.
- Seems pretty impressive so far.

17:52.493 --> 17:54.293
Hi. Your parking.

17:54.328 --> 17:56.212
- Murray, always a pleasure.
- Indeed.

17:56.246 --> 17:58.831
- Eric, good luck with your girl.
- Thanks, buddy.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.835
- Let me show you around.
- Steve nash, huh?

18:02.869 --> 18:04.670
We represent a lot of athletes.

18:04.704 --> 18:06.923
- You like football?
- You kidding? I love football.

18:06.974 --> 18:09.091
Maybe I'll take you to
the super bowl this year.

18:09.143 --> 18:10.543
- How's that sound?
- Sounds great.

18:12.729 --> 18:15.431
<i>Come on, you're an actor. Why so shy?</i>

18:15.482 --> 18:16.916
Put the camera away, please.

18:16.950 --> 18:20.052
God, I'm creating art
here. Are you not an artist?

18:20.070 --> 18:21.604
I don't do nudity.

18:21.655 --> 18:25.024
Well, what if I get a friend over
here and then she can tape for us?

18:25.058 --> 18:26.492
<i>Uh, no.</i>

18:26.527 --> 18:28.327
- Two friends? I can do it.
- Still no.

18:28.362 --> 18:31.080
You know what? I've got to
get this. I've got to get this.

18:32.499 --> 18:33.899
Yo, johnny. No.

18:33.917 --> 18:35.668
- I lost her, bro.
- What do you mean?

18:35.702 --> 18:38.754
I was at the commissary watching them
eat and they somehow slipped away.

18:38.789 --> 18:40.907
She has to do the scene. I'm
sure she'll be right back.

18:40.941 --> 18:43.793
Yeah, well, I hope so.
She's not in her trailer.

18:43.844 --> 18:46.212
Hey, jimmy, did you see jamie?

18:46.246 --> 18:47.830
I want to run lines before we shoot.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.682
She's with coakley.

18:49.716 --> 18:51.717
He just called to see if
we could push her an hour.

18:51.752 --> 18:54.053
<i>- And you said yes?
- Why wouldn't I?</i>

18:54.087 --> 18:57.590
<i>- Because the guy's a predator.
- Why would I care?</i>

18:57.624 --> 19:01.060
Jesus christ. This is bad,
bro. This is really bad.

19:01.094 --> 19:02.912
<i>Uh, what?</i>

19:02.946 --> 19:04.830
Christ, it's turtle.

19:04.865 --> 19:06.432
Tell him I'll meet him
at the car in 20 minutes.

19:06.466 --> 19:09.318
- I'm not answering it.
- You got to answer the phone, johnny.

19:09.369 --> 19:11.704
Hang on.

19:11.738 --> 19:15.208
Yo, turtle. All good, all good.

19:15.242 --> 19:16.692
<i>- Class good?
- Yeah.</i>

19:16.727 --> 19:18.227
You sound weird. Everything okay?

19:18.262 --> 19:20.079
No no, all good.

19:20.113 --> 19:21.764
I just tried jamie. She didn't pick up.

19:21.798 --> 19:23.332
I was gonna grab vince and roll back over.

19:23.367 --> 19:25.284
No need to do that.

19:25.302 --> 19:26.586
Well, I'm gonna do it anyway, weirdo.

19:26.620 --> 19:29.505
<i>See you in a bit.</i>

19:30.757 --> 19:32.008
Vince.

19:32.059 --> 19:34.460
<i>Vince!</i>

19:34.478 --> 19:36.229
- Oh shit. Hello?
- Don't stop.

19:36.263 --> 19:38.097
<i>- Johnny.
- We're ready for you, drama.</i>

19:38.131 --> 19:40.816
<i>- I'm coming, I'm coming.
- Johnny, what did turtle say?</i>

19:40.851 --> 19:43.853
He said he needs an hour.
Go find something to do.

19:43.904 --> 19:46.272
<i>- Uh, okay.
- Later.</i>

19:46.306 --> 19:47.973
Later.

19:47.991 --> 19:50.142
Maybe you should call one
of those friends of yours.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.827
You know, eric, I really like you.

19:51.862 --> 19:53.779
Sloan knows a good thing when she sees one.

19:53.813 --> 19:56.832
- Yeah, well...
- It's a pity you two aren't still together.

19:56.867 --> 19:59.285
We're friends though. We both moved on.

19:59.319 --> 20:03.005
How does the new girl feel about
your friend putting you up for a job?

20:03.040 --> 20:06.259
- She doesn't know.
- Trust me, I've been married four times.

20:06.293 --> 20:09.662
It's only a matter of time before
she finds out. She won't be thrilled.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.014
Well, truth is, I'm not really thrilled

20:12.049 --> 20:14.050
About my ex-girlfriendputting
mr a job either.

20:14.101 --> 20:17.520
Well, get over it 'cause all
she did was tell me about you.

20:17.554 --> 20:20.523
I've done my research and I like you.

20:20.557 --> 20:22.858
That's how I work. So what else?

20:22.893 --> 20:24.644
Murray, this place is amazing.

20:24.678 --> 20:26.812
I mean, this is exactly
what I've been looking for...

20:26.846 --> 20:28.681
A place with people to bounce ideas off of,

20:28.699 --> 20:31.450
Resources, somewhere to feel
like I really exist in this town.

20:31.485 --> 20:34.403
- And your concern is?
- That this is about vince.

20:34.454 --> 20:37.206
- You're very insecure.
- Not usually.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.125
Look, I want vince. Who doesn't?

20:39.159 --> 20:41.127
But my business was not built on talent

20:41.161 --> 20:42.861
'cause talent comes and goes.

20:42.879 --> 20:45.498
<i>This place was built on the
people who work in this office.</i>

20:45.532 --> 20:48.084
<i>- So if vince fired me?
- You think he would?</i>

20:48.135 --> 20:49.635
Well, he has before.

20:49.670 --> 20:51.754
The pitfalls of having one client.

20:51.788 --> 20:54.390
It's not a great situation.

20:54.424 --> 20:56.542
Which is exactly why you need to be here

20:56.560 --> 20:58.010
Where they'll be multiple vinces.

20:58.044 --> 20:59.645
And should one tell you to fuck off

20:59.680 --> 21:01.681
<i>You'd have nothing more than a bad day.</i>

21:01.715 --> 21:05.318
I'm worth more than 90% of my clients, eric.

21:05.352 --> 21:07.403
Here's my offer.

21:10.941 --> 21:12.825
Well, uh...

21:12.859 --> 21:14.393
Yeah, I mean, I make more than this now.

21:14.428 --> 21:16.746
If vince fired you, you'd make nothing.

21:16.780 --> 21:19.081
Here you'd still make that. It's pretty good.

21:19.116 --> 21:21.000
And you do good, it'll get better.

21:21.034 --> 21:23.619
<i>You want to be a part of something?</i>

21:25.339 --> 21:26.956
Yeah, I do.

21:26.990 --> 21:28.907
Good, start Monday.

21:28.925 --> 21:31.243
- I'm gonna kill it for you, murray.
- I have no doubt.

21:31.261 --> 21:33.746
Now go home and find out what
you did to your girlfriend.

21:33.764 --> 21:35.798
Thanks. I'll see you on Monday.

21:39.419 --> 21:42.371
<i>- Standby!
- You know coakley banged my old girl, right?</i>

21:42.406 --> 21:45.191
- Shut up.
- I'm serious. Rachel.

21:45.225 --> 21:47.993
- Ready to try another take?
- Yeah yeah yeah, let's do it.

21:48.028 --> 21:51.113
- I don't remember any rachel.
- Yeah, this was years ago.

21:51.148 --> 21:52.832
I was devastated over it.

21:52.866 --> 21:54.600
Didn't really recover till I got this show,

21:54.634 --> 21:57.153
Which was dan's way of
apologizing. He didn't make me...

21:57.204 --> 21:59.905
Would you stop talking about this?
This is an important episode for me.

21:59.939 --> 22:01.574
<i>Okay, let's roll cameras.</i>

22:01.608 --> 22:03.659
Yeah yeah, sure. I'm sorry.

22:03.710 --> 22:07.046
Sound rolling, scene 23, take 6.

22:09.015 --> 22:11.617
<i>Okay, and background action.</i>

22:11.651 --> 22:13.786
<i>Action!</i>

22:13.804 --> 22:15.588
Her uncle don't got nothing on me.

22:15.622 --> 22:19.008
He's some loudmouthed,
wide-bellied...

22:20.727 --> 22:23.813
Line! What's that line again?

22:23.847 --> 22:26.565
Jesus christ. Let's cut.

22:26.600 --> 22:30.302
Uh, johnny, that's like six
takes. What's the problem?

22:30.337 --> 22:32.772
I'm just having a hard time focusing.

22:32.806 --> 22:34.139
Want me to get you some ritalin?

22:34.157 --> 22:35.908
No no, I got it. Let's go again.

22:35.942 --> 22:38.027
Yeah, let's do it right
away. Right away, come on.

22:38.061 --> 22:40.780
You really worried about
what he's doing with jamie?

22:40.814 --> 22:43.048
Hell yeah, he's worried. And he should be.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.400
Shut up, brandon. You don't know anything.

22:44.434 --> 22:46.252
<i>Okay, let's roll camera.</i>

22:46.286 --> 22:48.987
- Okay.
- I know it hurt when I lost my girl.

22:49.005 --> 22:52.074
Probably would have hurt even more
if I lost my best friend's girl.

22:52.109 --> 22:55.277
Sound rolling, scene 23, take 7.

22:56.146 --> 22:58.697
<i>And action!</i>

23:04.521 --> 23:07.289
- I'll be right back!
- Drama!

23:09.192 --> 23:11.060
I need a ride to studio 8.

23:11.094 --> 23:13.596
No, man. I'm sorry, I have
to wait for mr. Busfield.

23:13.630 --> 23:15.798
- Talent first.
- Sorry.

23:15.832 --> 23:17.633
So am I.

23:17.667 --> 23:19.969
<i>Seriously, come on.</i>

23:22.572 --> 23:25.357
Yo, drama. Drama!

23:35.201 --> 23:36.802
Hello, mr. Chase. Can I help you?

23:36.837 --> 23:38.237
<i>- Where's coakley?
- In a meeting.</i>

23:38.271 --> 23:39.672
<i>He doesn't want to be disturbed.</i>

23:39.706 --> 23:41.807
Me neither, but it's my lot in life.

23:46.062 --> 23:48.013
What are you doing here, john?

23:48.048 --> 23:49.999
Uh, where's jamie?

23:50.033 --> 23:52.551
Uh...

23:52.569 --> 23:55.187
Would you give us a second, please?

23:57.023 --> 23:59.859
What, do you have some kind of
self-destructive career death wish?

23:59.893 --> 24:01.694
I just want to know where she is.

24:01.728 --> 24:04.580
She should be back on set. I
finished with her 20 minutes ago.

24:04.614 --> 24:07.166
Did you fuck her, dan?

24:07.200 --> 24:09.134
- What?
- Did you fuck her?

24:09.169 --> 24:11.637
You hitting that, john?

24:11.671 --> 24:14.740
No, but my boy is. Which
means you better not be.

24:14.774 --> 24:18.244
Oh, careful, johnny. You are not a
good enough actor to threaten your boss.

24:18.278 --> 24:19.895
Yeah well, I'm a good enough friend.

24:19.930 --> 24:22.631
- Keep that in mind.
- Relax.

24:22.682 --> 24:24.750
I didn't fuck her.

24:29.756 --> 24:32.608
But I'm going to. 'cause
all I can think about now

24:32.642 --> 24:35.861
Is how sweet it would be to ram
tony soprano's daughter from behind...

24:38.315 --> 24:40.533
Big mistake, john.

24:40.567 --> 24:42.100
I can have you killed.

24:42.118 --> 24:44.570
- Yeah? By who?
- The writers.

24:49.659 --> 24:52.661
Move out the way, dead man walking.

25:08.562 --> 25:11.764
Ashley. I see you in there.

25:11.798 --> 25:13.933
Would you just please open
up and tell me what I did?

25:22.242 --> 25:24.026
<i>What do you want from me, eric?</i>

25:24.077 --> 25:25.327
I just want to know why you're mad at me.

25:25.362 --> 25:27.980
Because you're a liar and I hate liars.

25:27.998 --> 25:29.982
I haven't even seen you since
we left. How could I have lied?

25:30.000 --> 25:33.168
<i>- It doesn't matter.
- Please, I'm sure I can explain.</i>

25:33.203 --> 25:34.703
Yeah, I'm sure you can too,

25:34.754 --> 25:37.289
And I'd rather not set myself
up to look like an idiot again.

25:37.323 --> 25:38.841
Ashley, come on.

25:38.875 --> 25:41.377
<i>Fine, tell me again what's
going on with you and sloan.</i>

25:41.428 --> 25:43.012
What? Nothing.

25:43.046 --> 25:44.830
Tell me when was the last time you saw her.

25:44.848 --> 25:46.582
Where is this coming from?

25:54.357 --> 25:57.893
She called you. Said she saw you yesterday.

25:57.944 --> 26:00.379
You fucking lied to me and
I fucked you after you did.

26:00.413 --> 26:03.682
I didn't lie to you. You asked me
if I'd been with her and I haven't.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.868
Yes, I saw her yesterday by chance.

26:05.902 --> 26:08.520
She put me up for this job which is
why I'm considering not taking it.

26:08.538 --> 26:11.023
But I haven't been with
her. I swear on my mother.

26:11.041 --> 26:12.875
Yeah, I knew you'd have an explanation.

26:12.909 --> 26:15.210
- You're smooth like that.
- Smooth? I'm not smooth.

26:15.245 --> 26:18.163
Ashley, nobody's ever
called me smooth. Please.

26:18.197 --> 26:20.165
Eric, just forget whatever this situation may

26:20.199 --> 26:22.468
Or may not be and admit you
still have feelings for her.

26:22.502 --> 26:25.754
- Come on.
- Don't be like every other jerk in this town.

26:25.805 --> 26:28.974
Here's your one chance
to clear it all with me

26:29.009 --> 26:31.093
And let me think of you in a good light.

26:31.144 --> 26:34.013
Ashley, look, I like you a lot.

26:34.047 --> 26:35.564
Do you still have feelings for her?

26:35.598 --> 26:37.900
Just answer me truthfully, please.

26:42.022 --> 26:45.223
Yeah, I guess I do. Sorry.

26:45.241 --> 26:47.443
Me too.

26:48.394 --> 26:50.029
Goodbye, eric.
