to a CRM soldier.

51:46.033 --> 51:48.645
Where the hell
are your legs?

51:48.688 --> 51:51.387
One of the last scenes
between Al and Morgan

51:51.430 --> 51:55.173
is an interview where Morgan
says he saved Al's life,

51:55.217 --> 51:56.696
so she owes him an interview,

51:56.740 --> 51:59.482

to the fact that

that Al saved Morgan's life
way back in 401

52:01.962 --> 52:04.226

he owed her an interview.

where she is?

Yeah.

going after her?

52:11.058 --> 52:12.625
He's asking her these questions

52:12.669 --> 52:14.323

to have to confront the fact

that she's the obstacle
standing in the way right now

52:17.326 --> 52:21.199

Isabelle, the woman she loves.

to Al and Morgan's first episode
on "Fear the Walking Dead,"

had one more person in it,

52:37.346 --> 52:39.522
Even though he's not with
these characters,

52:39.565 --> 52:42.307
we can feel him there,
because Morgan is moving forward

52:42.351 --> 52:43.830
with the lessons he learned

52:43.874 --> 52:46.659
and Al is hearing kind of
the echoes of everything

52:46.703 --> 52:48.226
that John Dorie would have said

52:48.270 --> 52:50.141
if he were standing there
in this episode,

telling Al that she's got to
get on that helicopter

we wanted to be clear
that it wasn't going to be easy.

53:13.991 --> 53:17.342
We kind of landed on this idea
of having Al's interview

53:17.386 --> 53:20.650
that she had done with Isabelle
to be playing in the background.

53:20.693 --> 53:23.653
It spoke to Isabelle's love
for Al,

53:23.696 --> 53:25.785
that she's in this cabin
watching this tape

53:25.829 --> 53:28.005
