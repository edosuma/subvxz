WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:03.627
James Green? You're hereby
placed under arrest.

00:03.795 --> 00:05.295
The vacant
executive officer position?

00:05.463 --> 00:07.881
My recommendation will be
to appoint Dr. Foster.

00:08.048 --> 00:08.924
What?

00:09.092 --> 00:11.093
Leave with me.
I can't.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.845
I's waiting
for my Gabriel.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.513
That hospital
you have access to --

00:14.681 --> 00:17.766
we're going to blow that place
to kingdom come.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.931
Miss Dix?

01:39.099 --> 01:42.226
Our mission grows,
Miss Phinney.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.937
The war
will not end soon.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.772
I fear that is so.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.524
Fear?

01:48.691 --> 01:51.401
Oh, don't do that.

01:51.569 --> 01:55.697
The dark menace of the future
makes cowards of us all,

01:55.865 --> 01:59.118
and the past is a thing
which each of us must overcome

01:59.285 --> 02:01.411
in her own way.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.706
Is that not so,
my dear baroness?

02:04.874 --> 02:06.458
Have I
disappointed you?

02:06.626 --> 02:10.753
Have you
disappointed yourself?

02:10.922 --> 02:13.132
It has not been
as I expected.

02:13.299 --> 02:17.094
Oh. It never is.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.763
But we need places
of healing and mercy

02:19.931 --> 02:21.598
now more than ever.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.017
So, you must
fight through it --

02:24.185 --> 02:30.065
the hardships, the resistance,
the futility.

02:32.902 --> 02:36.905
There is nothing here
without you.

02:37.073 --> 02:40.492
Miss Phinney?
It's been four hours.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.202
You asked for me
to wake you.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.288
Yes, matron.
Thank you.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.628
Not worth it?

02:51.796 --> 02:53.797
The executive officer is
second in command to me,

02:53.965 --> 02:55.716
with a direct link
to the surgeon general.

02:55.884 --> 03:00.137
Administration, paperwork --
not for me, major, really.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.306
Foster, I beseech you.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.099
It's good for your career.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.354
Does the position have influence
over staffing decisions?

03:09.522 --> 03:10.439
No.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.399
I-I-I mean yes.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.650
Why?

03:13.818 --> 03:15.194
The steward has to go.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.112
Oh, my,
the dog with his bone.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.323
Bullen is a disgrace
to this hospital.

03:19.490 --> 03:22.868
Nothing is beyond him --
deceit, larceny, lechery.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.453
So, you don't
like him much?

03:25.788 --> 03:27.289
I'll discuss it with Bullen,
and I'll insist on improvement.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.082
It's a half-measure, sir.

03:31.085 --> 03:34.379
We cannot fire
our steward, Foster.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.089
Not right now.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.925
Listen to me.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.301
We are soon
to have a visit

03:39.469 --> 03:41.178
from the president
and the first lady.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.638
The Lincolns?

03:42.805 --> 03:44.806
It's on the quiet, Jed.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.601
Now, until the muckety-mucks
have come and gone,

03:47.769 --> 03:50.771
I need this place to run
smoothly, keep up appearances,

03:50.939 --> 03:54.024
and I need you to be
my executive officer.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.489
There's my man.
Mm.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.574
There's my man.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.867
Mm-hmm.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.036
Our mission here is growing.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.705
Moving forward, I would like
a daily report from each ward

04:08.873 --> 04:10.332
detailing
all continuing patients,

04:10.500 --> 04:12.000
the condition
of the newly admitted,

04:12.168 --> 04:13.543
and available beds.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.587
If any of your boys are in need
of supplements

04:15.755 --> 04:17.714
or special meals they are not
receiving from the cook,

04:17.882 --> 04:19.132
come and see me.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.591
Is it true?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.261
About Dr. Foster?

04:22.428 --> 04:24.471
Is he to be
the executive officer?

04:26.474 --> 04:28.058
That's the word
from the chief.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.602
Well, now we have a head nurse

04:30.770 --> 04:32.854
and an executive officer.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.690
We are prepared
for anything.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.401
As I believe Miss Nightingale
once said,

04:37.568 --> 04:41.196
we are all in this together.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.198
Isn't that so, Miss Hastings?

05:17.275 --> 05:22.195
Mister?
It's me, Belinda.

05:22.363 --> 05:27.242
I done brung you some food
and some ginger-root tea.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.245
Be good for your bones.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.165
This is the worst hotel
I've ever stayed in.

05:33.332 --> 05:36.251
There's evil
in this place.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.378
I've been here before --
to see my brother.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.047
You don't remember?

05:40.214 --> 05:43.008
They fed him
pork and greens

05:43.176 --> 05:47.637
and made him a fine suit
to show hisself.

05:47.805 --> 05:52.517
That was 9 --
no, it was, uh...11 years now.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.561
They took him to market.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.730
It was a...

05:56.898 --> 05:59.775
A sunny day...

05:59.942 --> 06:01.818
Burning hot.

06:01.986 --> 06:06.656
Remember I see'd the sweat
running down 'round his collar.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.662
And I never
see'd him again.

06:12.830 --> 06:16.333
Well, maybe you will
before too long.

06:17.877 --> 06:21.338
The ladies is all worried
for you.

06:21.506 --> 06:26.760
And Mr. junior out there
arguing with the warden man.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.345
Arguing what?

06:28.513 --> 06:31.264
'Bout getting you free.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.058
Here. Drink.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.061
Surely the union administration
is not in the habit

06:36.229 --> 06:38.688
of imprisoning frail,
harmless, old men!

06:38.856 --> 06:42.317
My job is to lock up
who they tell me to lock up

06:42.485 --> 06:44.444
and let go
who they tell me to let go.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.363
Get him to sign, son.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.782
It ain't worth all this.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.451
Nurse Mary.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.495
Private Starks.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.455
The boy came
with the post.

06:55.623 --> 06:59.209
Um, I can't...
Make out the words.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.838
Would you like me
to read it?

07:03.005 --> 07:04.548
Mm.

07:11.889 --> 07:16.977
"My dearest Philip, I do not
know if you are alive or dead.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.855
I hope for the best,
of course.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.566
Yet I feel compelled
to write this letter to --

07:27.363 --> 07:30.991
to say
how much I miss you...

07:31.159 --> 07:33.743
And pray
for your safe return.

07:35.997 --> 07:40.375
I cannot predict
what the future holds,

07:40.543 --> 07:44.171
but I trust
you will remain strong...

07:44.338 --> 07:48.758
And we will see each other again
before too long."

07:48.926 --> 07:50.343
And then she signs it.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.018
A good girl, my addy.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.189
If she can't get here,
then, by God,

08:02.356 --> 08:03.773
I'll rise from this bed
soon enough,

08:03.941 --> 08:07.444
and I'll get to her
if it takes my last breath.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.779
Private Starks,
how are you?

08:09.947 --> 08:11.156
Better now, sir.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.116
Well, the wound seems
to be improving,

08:13.284 --> 08:15.243
but it's
a long road yet.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.245
You my doctor now?

08:17.413 --> 08:19.331
What happened
to that other one?

08:23.044 --> 08:24.211
Oh, stop it!

08:24.378 --> 08:26.129
Dr. hale!
Hold on!

08:26.297 --> 08:29.633
I'm about to remove
another shred of ball metal.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.635
Dr. hale,
step away, please!

08:34.347 --> 08:36.139
Has that man
been anesthetized?

08:36.307 --> 08:37.807
This one? No.
Why not?

08:37.975 --> 08:39.976
Pain is cathartic.
It doesn't sound cathartic.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.727
We have our
separate methods, sir.

08:41.895 --> 08:42.938
It is not up to
the surgeon to de--

08:43.105 --> 08:44.773
it is not
up to the surgeon.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.233
It is up to the standard
of the hospital,

08:46.400 --> 08:48.068
and the standard here --
standard?

08:48.236 --> 08:49.611
There's no standard
in this hospital.
There is now.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.450
How many patients do you think
I move through here

08:55.618 --> 08:56.785
in the time
it takes for you

08:56.953 --> 08:58.245
to tenderly hold
one boy's hand,

08:58.412 --> 09:01.039
sing him a hymn,
and beseech him to be brave?

09:01.207 --> 09:04.042
Do you truly believe
that your humanity

09:04.210 --> 09:07.420
is so much better
than my proficiency?

09:09.548 --> 09:11.967
Chloroform will be used
to ease pain

09:12.134 --> 09:14.594
except where it is clearly
not indicated.

09:14.762 --> 09:16.805
I do not want to hear
of one more patient

09:16.973 --> 09:19.975
having a catharsis
under your care.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.227
Now give him the drug.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.696
Oh, Jimmy,
how did he look?
How is he?

09:32.863 --> 09:34.447
What did he say?
Now, now.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.449
I spoke to the warden.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.951
There's nothing
he can do, but --

09:38.119 --> 09:39.619
oh, they're all
so treacherous.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.163
But I have a plan.
What did your father say?

09:42.331 --> 09:45.417
I only saw him briefly.
Belinda sat with him awhile.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.877
Oh.

09:48.045 --> 09:51.089
He got a strong will.
He ain't gonna let it break him.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.009
But he ain't gonna sign
that paper, neither.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.594
You ask me,
it's time he did.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.267
Listen here.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.727
As man of this house now,

10:03.894 --> 10:05.437
I want to discuss
what we should do next.

10:05.604 --> 10:08.982
We need to appeal to the provost
marshal -- Colonel Sinex.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.735
He overruled the administrator
last time,

10:11.902 --> 10:13.361
and perhaps
he will do it again.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.196
You and Alice do that.
Yes.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.781
- I'll go see Frank.
- Excuse me, ladies.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.450
Frank?
Frank Stringfellow?

10:18.617 --> 10:20.160
He's back in Alexandria.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.495
It's all very secret,
mother.

10:22.663 --> 10:23.955
He's with the knights
of the golden circle.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.373
The knights? Really?

10:25.541 --> 10:27.792
Their methods have become
a bit extreme.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.377
The yanks are
just as extreme.

10:29.545 --> 10:32.088
Frank may be able to help.
He has ways.

10:32.256 --> 10:35.633
Mm. All right,
we have our missions.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.802
Circumstances
may challenge us,

10:37.970 --> 10:41.056
but we are still
the Green family.

10:41.223 --> 10:42.807
All right?

10:46.854 --> 10:48.480
Very good, ladies.

10:48.647 --> 10:50.523
I'll just sit here
and whistle "Dixie."

11:20.304 --> 11:24.766
Mr. Griffin, I have
a terrible pain in my molar.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.353
Not now, Emma.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.771
I can't see you.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.606
Please.
I've come about my father.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.024
We need your help.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.069
Why don't you ask
one of your yankee pals?

11:36.237 --> 11:37.487
The chaplain,
for instance.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.156
Frank, my father's unwell.
He could die in there.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.117
It's a war, Emma.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.618
We all could die.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.081
I'm sorry.
I-I-I didn't mean to --

11:50.084 --> 11:54.295
what's important is
for each of us, in his own way,

11:54.463 --> 11:56.381
to remain loyal
to the cause.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.550
That's what I'm doing, that's
what your father is doing,

11:58.717 --> 12:01.428
and I hope that's
what you're doing

12:01.595 --> 12:03.430
'cause it doesn't always
look that way to me.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.101
Laudanum drops
thrice daily, Miss.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.769
And come back tomorrow.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.575
Dr. hale.

12:23.742 --> 12:26.995
One of the few of your ilk
I welcome with open arms.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.914
Mr. Bullen.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.959
You and your friend
nurse Hastings

12:33.127 --> 12:35.295
you know how things work --
don't fight the system.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.714
I appreciate that.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.800
And she -- she's
a nice ripe one, ain't she?

12:40.968 --> 12:42.385
Well, uh...

12:43.762 --> 12:45.472
...that's kind of you
to say.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.435
What do you need,
doctor?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.437
Need? Oh,
I don't know about need.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.648
I was, um...
I was just wondering --

12:55.816 --> 12:57.525
have you been informed

12:57.693 --> 13:01.237
of Dr. Foster's
new hospital policy pertaining

13:01.405 --> 13:04.240
to expanding
the use of chloroform?

13:04.408 --> 13:07.410
I heard something about it
from the great man himself.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.038
Came down here
and explained it all to me,

13:10.206 --> 13:12.415
right after I got my what for
from major summers.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.667
Summers?
Pertaining to what?

13:14.835 --> 13:17.337
Pertaining to my decorum.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.882
It seems the new
executive officer don't like me.

13:21.050 --> 13:24.344
What with the new head nurse
making her own meals for the men

13:24.512 --> 13:26.971
and now
him lording over us,

13:27.139 --> 13:28.848
what's to become
of us poor, innocent workers

13:29.016 --> 13:30.266
toiling away down here?

13:30.434 --> 13:32.852
My concern exactly,
which got me thinking --

13:33.020 --> 13:36.648
it'd be a terrible strain
on the new executive officer

13:36.815 --> 13:41.277
were there to be a...
Sudden shortage of chloroform.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.740
How's that gonna
solve anything?

13:45.908 --> 13:47.784
You ask me,
this Foster's got to go.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.287
Think of chloroform as being
our own Fort Sumter.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.290
Before long, the battle
will prove too great,

13:54.458 --> 14:00.046
at which point, he will
be replaced...By another.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.592
Given your loyalty,
I will be sure to enlist you

14:04.760 --> 14:07.845
as a close,
personal associate

14:08.013 --> 14:12.016
and make sure
both our needs are always met.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.023
Yeah.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.154
You're kind of a weasel,
ain't you?

14:25.322 --> 14:26.322
Mm.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.366
Do we have a deal?

14:45.843 --> 14:47.468
You're late.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.305
Well, I was expecting
a -- a longer ovation.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.974
It was "The Lady of Lyons"
tonight. It's not Shakespeare.

14:53.142 --> 14:56.436
So?

14:56.604 --> 14:58.563
I've got
the office set up.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.939
We're moving in supplies,

15:00.107 --> 15:01.858
a little each day,
to avoid detection.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.485
There's no time for all that.
You need to be swift.

15:04.653 --> 15:08.656
Those bastards could change
his schedule at any moment.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.242
What if he shows up
sooner than planned?

15:11.410 --> 15:14.871
We can't miss out just because
you were being cautious.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.332
We're going to
blow king Lincoln

15:17.499 --> 15:20.918
and his whole damn government
straight to hell.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.387
You understand your role?

15:31.555 --> 15:32.722
I am a little lamb,

15:32.890 --> 15:34.974
upset and confused by the loss
of my father.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.851
Perhaps a tear or two.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.270
And a little less rage.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.607
I am willing to do whatever
needs be done to free papa.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.108
But that does not mean

15:44.276 --> 15:46.736
I will enjoy groveling
to these blue bullies.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.614
Men are allowed to fall prey
to their emotions, Alice.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.824
We women must be stronger
than that.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.499
You seem on the road
to recovery.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.460
I had me some sassafras root.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.212
Seemed to help.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.546
Did the doctor
give you that?

16:05.714 --> 16:08.716
No. I had a friend
bring it to me.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.718
That your husband?

16:13.722 --> 16:16.516
You got
any chil'ren, Miss?

16:16.684 --> 16:19.477
We were not
so blessed, no.

16:19.645 --> 16:25.525
I got me a little boy --
Gabriel, 7 years of age.

16:25.693 --> 16:30.780
I ain't seen him
in 15 months and... 10 days.

16:32.449 --> 16:38.246
Samuel say we find each other
again, me and Gabriel.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.373
You are fond of Sam?

16:42.751 --> 16:45.044
Got angry with him.

16:45.212 --> 16:48.506
Now he gone.

16:48.674 --> 16:52.677
It's better this way
until things change.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.096
He's better off
elsewhere.

16:55.264 --> 16:58.307
I been in Alexandria
over a year now,

16:58.475 --> 17:00.977
dreaming
my boy find me here,

17:01.145 --> 17:06.065
doing everything I can
to make it so.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.483
Anything.

17:11.446 --> 17:14.615
There's no shame
in trying to save your child.

17:16.827 --> 17:20.538
I been thinking
I should pick up and leave,

17:20.705 --> 17:23.583
try to find my Gabriel
from some other place,

17:23.751 --> 17:26.544
someplace
ain't so troubled.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.023
My late husband
gave me this.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.483
It's a mayflower.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.860
They're abundant
where I'm from in Boston.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.237
Sure is pretty.

17:53.405 --> 17:58.493
There's a community of free
negroes there, on beacon hill.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.787
Find
Miss Elizabeth Mcandrew.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.830
We went to school
together.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.458
She lives on Boylston.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.710
Show this to her.

18:07.878 --> 18:11.714
She'll help you find
your way...And your little boy.

18:13.842 --> 18:16.052
You ain't
got to do this.

18:16.220 --> 18:20.264
No real good comes
out of doing what we have to do.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.642
It comes out of doing
what's right.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.778
The provost Marshall
will see you now.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.863
Thank you.
At long last.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.823
Smile as if
you mean it.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.326
Colonel Sinex likes
pretty girls.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.502
What can I do for you?

18:49.670 --> 18:51.587
We were hoping
to see Colonel Sinex.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.464
Sinex has been
reassigned.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.301
Re-assigned?

18:57.469 --> 18:59.679
There was a virus of corruption
spreading through this town.

18:59.846 --> 19:03.057
The army desires order,
so here I am --

19:03.225 --> 19:07.853
colonel Gregory,
the new provost marshal.

19:08.021 --> 19:10.398
State your case.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.651
That's my favorite.
How did you know?

19:13.819 --> 19:15.653
You are a man
of exquisite taste.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.071
All decisions
flow from that.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.364
Ah.

19:18.532 --> 19:19.991
From the moment
of occupation onward,

19:20.158 --> 19:22.118
you've been a true friend
to my family and our interests,

19:22.286 --> 19:23.536
and I want to thank you
for that.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.079
You're quite welcome.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.790
And I wonder if I might not
offer up a service.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.458
Another one?

19:29.626 --> 19:31.711
I have heard
that fallen union soldiers

19:31.878 --> 19:34.338
are not being properly buried
in confederate territory,

19:34.506 --> 19:37.341
bodies dropped into the ground
with no benediction,

19:37.509 --> 19:40.469
no recognition,
some never buried at all.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.013
It's a terrible thing,
it is.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.432
Perhaps you would allow me
to send our coffins South

19:44.600 --> 19:46.934
so that all soldiers
in this terrible war

19:47.102 --> 19:49.145
might be buried
with honor.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.272
You'd provide
the coffins?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.024
And the transport.

19:53.191 --> 19:55.610
Our furniture company's barge
has been grounded

19:55.777 --> 19:57.278
since the union came
to Alexandria.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.155
It wasn't
requisitioned?

19:59.323 --> 20:02.366
Well, sir,
they haven't found it yet.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.452
But I could use it
to move the coffins

20:04.620 --> 20:06.120
as well
as anything else.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.123
Well, that seems
a kind gesture, Mr. Green.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.959
I have to wonder
how that would benefit you.

20:15.213 --> 20:17.006
My father sits in jail.

20:17.174 --> 20:20.051
If you could perhaps
put in a word for his release,

20:20.218 --> 20:22.887
mention our largesse,
our unbiased generosity --

20:23.055 --> 20:26.223
your father is a victim
of his own intransigence, sir.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.643
There's nothing
I can do about that.

20:28.810 --> 20:32.229
I will gladly
accept your offer, however.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.899
Our boys need
to be buried properly.

20:37.944 --> 20:39.987
Indeed, sir.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.114
Green family furniture
built in Alexandria

20:42.282 --> 20:44.033
will find its way
to the Southern battlefields

20:44.201 --> 20:46.494
on a mission
of mercy.

20:46.661 --> 20:47.953
In prison --

20:48.121 --> 20:51.415
as if he were
some common criminal, a thief.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.917
How long has it been?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.877
Almost two weeks.
Can you imagine?

20:55.045 --> 20:57.588
This is how we see honest Abe
for the tyrant he is --

20:57.756 --> 21:01.425
families torn apart,
innocent men put in jail.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.302
Maybe you should
write the president a letter.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.679
What good would that do?

21:05.847 --> 21:07.264
I want to say it
to his face.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.724
Say what, exactly?

21:12.229 --> 21:15.898
I'd tell him that you cannot
create a union by force.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.109
I'd tell him
that my father,

21:18.276 --> 21:20.569
as godly
and honorable a man

21:20.737 --> 21:22.113
as has ever
walked the earth,

21:22.280 --> 21:23.697
has been
unfairly maligned,

21:23.865 --> 21:27.326
all for the want of a signature
on a piece of foolscap.

21:27.494 --> 21:31.080
And I'd tell him
that I'm fearful...

21:31.248 --> 21:33.958
For myself...

21:34.126 --> 21:35.876
And for my family...

21:37.879 --> 21:41.006
...for all of us.

21:41.174 --> 21:43.509
He'd be a fool
not to listen.

21:50.016 --> 21:51.725
I better get these
to the laundry.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.144
Yes.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.776
Glad to see you're awake.

22:00.944 --> 22:03.070
Have I been sleeping long?

22:03.238 --> 22:05.823
Most of these
past few days.

22:05.991 --> 22:09.785
My wife come yet?

22:09.953 --> 22:11.704
No, not yet.

22:11.872 --> 22:15.124
You got a husband...
Ma'am?

22:17.544 --> 22:20.880
He died...
Before the war.

22:23.550 --> 22:28.220
Was his death long or --
or quick?

22:32.309 --> 22:36.103
Long and then quick.

22:36.271 --> 22:39.064
He struggled mightily.

22:39.232 --> 22:40.941
I sat by him
all that time,

22:41.109 --> 22:45.112
and then when
the moment finally came...

22:45.280 --> 22:48.407
I wasn't there.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.827
I'd gone out
for some supplies.

22:51.995 --> 22:54.205
When I came home,
he was gone.

22:54.372 --> 22:58.709
Don't take that
on yourself.

22:58.877 --> 23:03.839
Maybe he chose it
like that.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.967
Maybe --

23:07.135 --> 23:09.970
Maybe he didn't want you
to go through it.

23:14.434 --> 23:17.353
Where has
all the quinine gone?!

23:17.521 --> 23:19.897
If I was quinine,
where would I be?!

23:29.157 --> 23:31.909
Have you seen
the rogue today?

23:32.077 --> 23:33.327
Not to worry.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.955
I'm gonna show him
the folly of his ways.

23:36.122 --> 23:39.083
You missed
your moment, Byron.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.834
That's unfair.
How was I to --

23:41.002 --> 23:43.087
you missed your moment.

24:01.815 --> 24:04.108
The union army is suddenly
very conscientious

24:04.276 --> 24:06.235
about the interior decor
of the hospital.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.279
That's what happens when
presidents visit.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.406
Why, dear me,

24:10.574 --> 24:13.158
what one-armed wonder
thought of leaving that there?

24:13.326 --> 24:14.159
Sorry, ma'am.

24:14.327 --> 24:15.953
Well, clean it up now.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.831
You, sister, our lady
of dysentery -- find me quinine.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.958
I need quinine
for a boy lying in pain.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.251
Miss Hastings,
allow me to help --

24:22.419 --> 24:23.711
unhand me!

24:23.878 --> 24:26.213
I'll not have
your viper paws upon me.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.299
Oh, Miss Phinney?

24:28.466 --> 24:30.551
Oh, my, do forgive me.
I'm so sorry.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.596
I have this lovely,
fine-boned Vermont boy,

24:33.763 --> 24:36.181
regal in bearing,
who requires quinine, and --

24:36.349 --> 24:38.559
but I can't seem
to find any anywhere.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.644
Those scoundrels
have swiped it.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.147
Miss Hastings.
Bad morning?

24:43.315 --> 24:46.275
There he is -- Sir Galahad.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.735
Here to sweep me
off my feet?

24:47.902 --> 24:49.445
No, but I will escort you
to your room.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.239
Oh, how brash!
How utterly caddish!

24:52.407 --> 24:53.991
Please, Miss Hastings,
you're making a scene.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.868
A scene?
An executive scene?

24:56.036 --> 24:57.244
Is that
your executive assessment

24:57.412 --> 24:58.746
as the new
executive officer?

24:58.913 --> 24:59.913
Miss Hastings,
please --

25:00.081 --> 25:01.582
oh, he is
a snake in the grass.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.043
"I am not military,
oh, but now I am."

25:04.210 --> 25:06.754
"I don't want the job.
Oh, dear me! Now I have it!"

25:06.921 --> 25:08.964
And on top of it,
to insult a lady,

25:09.132 --> 25:11.383
to make accusations
about her intentions.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.093
I don't believe
I ever --

25:15.764 --> 25:16.889
no!
Oh, my.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.015
Miss Hastings!

25:29.986 --> 25:31.820
Pardon me.

25:31.988 --> 25:33.906
I am not myself today.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.577
Alice, be calm.

25:38.745 --> 25:40.913
I will invite this new colonel
over for dinner,

25:41.081 --> 25:43.707
and we will woo him
into changing his mind.

25:43.875 --> 25:44.917
Woo him?

25:45.085 --> 25:47.586
We Green women
have our ways.

25:47.754 --> 25:50.047
That's as good as letting papa
rot behind bars.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.257
Lower your voice,
please.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.176
If no favors
are to be paid us,

25:54.344 --> 25:56.512
then for now,
we must follow the rules.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.391
That is all we ever do --
follow their rules.

26:00.558 --> 26:02.142
And what has it
gotten us, mother?

26:02.310 --> 26:03.811
What did it get Tom?
Alice.

26:03.978 --> 26:06.021
If you want
to sit idly by...
I am hardly idle.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.691
...and let them run roughshod
over us, you may do so.

26:08.858 --> 26:11.151
But I swear
I will not submit!

26:11.319 --> 26:13.987
I will do my part
to defend who we are!

26:14.155 --> 26:15.989
Alice!

26:23.957 --> 26:25.624
Miss Hastings
is safely in her room

26:25.792 --> 26:27.209
being plied with coffee.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.628
You must dismiss her.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.047
You are
the head nurse, Mary.

26:32.215 --> 26:34.883
And you are
the executive officer...Jed.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.635
What would
Miss Dix say?

26:36.803 --> 26:38.095
Miss Dix is not here.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.638
So, Miss Hastings
should be kept on?

26:39.806 --> 26:41.515
With a reprimand.
She's a skilled nurse,

26:41.683 --> 26:43.267
and, to be fair,
it was one mistake.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.644
We all make mistakes,
don't we, doctor?

26:45.812 --> 26:47.479
"Doctor" is it now?

26:47.647 --> 26:49.314
We're going backwards.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.067
Now, about your patient --
he's worsening?

26:52.235 --> 26:54.653
Yes. It's
a very sad thing.

26:54.821 --> 26:57.406
You seem awfully attached to
him, considering he's a traitor.

26:57.574 --> 27:01.452
He deserted because
he was losing his wife...

27:01.619 --> 27:03.996
To another man.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.582
I read it in a letter.
Private Starks doesn't know.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.417
You kept it from him?

27:08.585 --> 27:12.004
I'm trying
to keep him alive.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.964
Good afternoon, private.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.799
Press against my hand.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.051
It hurts.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.012
Atrophy of
the gastrocnemius.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.055
Private, breathe easy.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.684
Continuing to
the semitendinosus.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.649
The muscles in his leg
have atrophied considerably.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.985
But there is perhaps
something we could do.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.820
If we were to cauterize
the peroneal nerve,

27:36.988 --> 27:39.323
it should alleviate
much of the pain.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.117
Would it save him?

27:42.285 --> 27:43.577
Well, let's hope so.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.870
We'll need a hot iron,

27:45.038 --> 27:46.789
the small scalpel set,
and chloroform.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.582
It is quite
a painful procedure.

27:48.750 --> 27:52.503
Uh, this morning the steward
said we had no more chloroform.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.379
What?
Th-that's not possible.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.465
He said we'd have no more
until July.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.884
Prepare the cautery.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.677
I'll see to this.

28:03.681 --> 28:06.099
Chloroform --
where is it?

28:06.267 --> 28:07.309
Chloroform?

28:07.477 --> 28:09.436
Don't play the fool
with me, man.

28:09.604 --> 28:10.813
We run out.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.439
Won't get another shipment
for a fortnight.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.691
My fault, Dr. Foster.
Must have counted wrong.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.193
You haven't counted wrong

28:16.361 --> 28:19.154
since you dropped out of
your mother's diseased womb.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.697
I need
that anesthetic!

28:20.865 --> 28:24.493
Need? I don't know
about need, doctor.

28:24.661 --> 28:27.538
Some say
pain is cathartic.

28:27.705 --> 28:29.957
Hale --
he put you up to this.

28:30.124 --> 28:31.166
I never said that.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.961
You didn't have to,
you imbecile.

28:40.760 --> 28:44.096
I'm sorry, son.
I'm unable to put you under.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.931
I'll try to be quick.

29:04.826 --> 29:05.909
Quick.

29:13.835 --> 29:16.253
Frank,
may I speak to you?

29:16.421 --> 29:19.381
Bad time, Alice, really.

29:19.549 --> 29:23.010
Why? Are you hatching
some master plan in there?

29:25.305 --> 29:28.181
You can come in,
but only for a minute.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.768
No chaperone.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.937
Are you out alone?

29:34.105 --> 29:36.773
War has a funny way
of changing all the rules.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.735
What is it you need,
Alice?

29:39.903 --> 29:44.364
To be of use --
to do my part in the struggle.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.999
I have a proposition.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.209
I've entered into an agreement
with the union army

29:56.377 --> 29:58.086
to send coffins
to the battlefields.

29:58.254 --> 30:02.257
Now, the coffins travel South
empty, presumably,

30:02.425 --> 30:04.426
but I have the opportunity
to fill them.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.721
Go on.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.682
We fill the coffins with
anything our boys might need --

30:10.850 --> 30:12.559
munitions, goods, gold --

30:12.727 --> 30:14.561
smuggle it
right past the blue bellies

30:14.729 --> 30:16.855
in the same box
they'll soon end up in.

30:18.566 --> 30:20.859
Shipping downriver
in my barge.

30:21.027 --> 30:22.611
You interested?

30:22.779 --> 30:24.279
That we are.

30:24.447 --> 30:27.324
Tomorrow.
I'll send my workers away.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.410
Meet me at the factory
with the goods.

30:30.578 --> 30:33.413
Little Jimmy Green.

30:33.581 --> 30:36.541
Done good.
We knew it wasn't so.

30:36.709 --> 30:37.834
What wasn't?

30:38.002 --> 30:39.920
Well, what everyone says
about you.

30:46.594 --> 30:50.389
Well, Jimmy Green!
There he is.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.891
How the hell are you?

30:53.059 --> 30:55.435
Not bad, Hayward,
under the circumstances.

30:55.603 --> 30:57.813
I heard about your father.
It's a tough break.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.898
Talk to someone on your side
about getting him out.

31:00.066 --> 31:01.233
I've had no luck.

31:01.401 --> 31:02.943
Well, you're
the man of the house

31:03.111 --> 31:05.070
as long as he's in the pen,
so it's up to you, really.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.279
How's that?

31:06.447 --> 31:07.614
All they want's
a signature

31:07.782 --> 31:09.074
from the man in charge
of the family.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.617
Sign it for him.
He'll be free.

31:12.495 --> 31:16.081
We went to school together,
played together.

31:16.249 --> 31:20.168
And now look at you...
In that uniform.

31:20.336 --> 31:22.087
You think this all
will be forgotten,

31:22.255 --> 31:24.214
that everything will be good
for your family

31:24.382 --> 31:25.966
after this is done?

31:26.134 --> 31:28.135
Greens aren't traitors.

31:28.302 --> 31:30.887
Greens don't capitulate.
That's not who we are!

31:34.475 --> 31:37.060
Give my regards
to your sister.

31:37.228 --> 31:39.730
I'm only saying...

31:39.897 --> 31:42.232
Your father's not getting
any younger in there.

31:45.820 --> 31:49.614
It has all
come to naught.

31:49.782 --> 31:53.368
Emma's filled
with passionate outrage.

31:53.536 --> 31:55.787
Jimmy junior is
nowhere to be found.

31:55.955 --> 31:59.166
Even our Alice has turned gloomy
and impertinent.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.585
She stormed out on me
in a fury.

32:01.753 --> 32:02.961
My dear --

32:03.129 --> 32:05.380
we are unraveling
without you, James.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.967
We are in disarray.

32:09.135 --> 32:12.721
This is all...
Temporary, I assure you.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.724
The tide of war is
in our favor.

32:15.892 --> 32:21.605
Jeff Davis will march
on Alexandria, and I will...

32:21.773 --> 32:24.733
I will be free,
free to go about my business

32:24.901 --> 32:30.447
with my family
at my side, proudly.

32:30.615 --> 32:35.535
I fear by then
your family will be broken.

32:35.703 --> 32:39.623
What would you
have me do?

32:39.791 --> 32:42.084
Sign it.

32:42.251 --> 32:47.422
Sign the oath
and come home.

32:47.590 --> 32:51.176
Please. Sign it.

32:54.597 --> 32:56.515
I cannot.

33:00.394 --> 33:02.687
Then we are lost.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.053
You fool!

33:35.221 --> 33:38.557
I told you -- no smoking
near the barrels.

33:38.724 --> 33:40.392
It's time.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.144
We got to start moving
those things into the hospital.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.944
Do you think father
will get out of jail soon?

33:51.112 --> 33:53.697
I sure hope so.

33:53.865 --> 33:58.243
If there was something more
I could do, I certainly would.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.078
Oh, I knows it.

34:00.246 --> 34:05.000
He knows it, too, 'cause
that's the woman you is now.

34:05.167 --> 34:08.253
If the chance come,
you gonna take it.

34:14.467 --> 34:19.222
More and more negroes
headed north, I hear.

34:19.389 --> 34:23.685
Do you ever think about leaving
us, going someplace else?

34:23.853 --> 34:29.815
Well, this been home
so long.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.652
Hard to leaving now.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.741
Good.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.244
Because we'd miss you
so terribly.

34:44.623 --> 34:45.873
Did you or did you not

34:46.042 --> 34:47.918
instruct Bullen
to sell the chloroform?

34:48.085 --> 34:51.338
Sell? That is
h-hardly the point.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.047
Well, I believe it is.

34:53.215 --> 34:54.382
The point
has to do with

34:54.550 --> 34:55.759
the methods
of practicing medicine

34:55.927 --> 34:57.510
which are espoused
by individual doctors...

34:57.678 --> 34:58.678
Please, hale.

34:58.846 --> 34:59.804
...and whether
or not anyone,

34:59.972 --> 35:01.097
even
the executive officer,

35:01.265 --> 35:02.265
has the right
to enforce practices...

35:02.433 --> 35:03.850
He does
because I say he does!

35:04.018 --> 35:05.268
...based on theories
which are not universally held!

35:05.436 --> 35:06.770
The man is a martinet!

35:06.938 --> 35:10.774
What in God's name
is wrong with you, hale?

35:10.942 --> 35:12.567
I have no idea what happened
to your chloroform.

35:12.735 --> 35:14.778
Then you and Bullen need to get
your stories straight.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.363
In the meantime,
I intend to find

35:16.530 --> 35:17.948
a suitable replacement
for you.

35:18.115 --> 35:19.783
Ah, you see, sir?
A martinet.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.117
Now, now, Foster --

35:21.285 --> 35:22.953
a doctor who understands
scientific medicine,

35:23.120 --> 35:26.915
who sees that anesthetic is not
a luxury, but a necessity.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.501
There's no room in this war
for doctors like you.

35:29.669 --> 35:32.337
That's n--

35:32.505 --> 35:34.589
what do you --

35:34.757 --> 35:36.091
oh, you can't mean --

35:36.258 --> 35:37.968
adjust your outlook.

35:38.135 --> 35:40.178
Make amends. You may be able
to save your job.

35:40.346 --> 35:43.014
There's nothing else
to say.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.106
Fully loaded, boys.

35:55.569 --> 35:57.362
You got vision, Green.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.863
Be awful useful
down where the fight is.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.782
I have obligations here.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.118
Smart, rich,
devoted to the cause --

36:03.285 --> 36:05.078
we could use
more like you.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.916
We'll be at the landing
at 9:00 tonight,

36:10.084 --> 36:12.293
after dark, loading up
these treasure chests.

36:12.461 --> 36:16.548
You want to join the fight,
you meet us there.

36:16.716 --> 36:19.217
Your family
will understand.

36:19.385 --> 36:22.429
Hell, they'll see you
as a hero.

36:32.815 --> 36:34.190
Frank,
what are you doing?

36:36.569 --> 36:38.028
I need to see you.

36:38.195 --> 36:39.904
After the way you spoke with me
the other day?

36:40.072 --> 36:41.781
I'm sorry for that.

36:41.949 --> 36:43.616
I am.

36:43.784 --> 36:47.037
Will you meet me today
at our spot, say, 4:00?

36:47.204 --> 36:48.496
I usually stay here

36:48.664 --> 36:49.706
until all the men are settled in
for the night.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.167
It must be 4:00.

36:52.334 --> 36:55.503
By the tree, please.

36:55.671 --> 36:57.630
You cannot be late.

36:57.798 --> 36:59.257
Are you all right?

37:00.968 --> 37:03.511
Why, yes, of course,

37:03.679 --> 37:07.515
only I-I miss you,
and I need to see you.

37:07.683 --> 37:08.808
But I --

37:08.976 --> 37:11.811
if you care about me,
Emma Green,

37:11.979 --> 37:13.772
you will not
make me beg.

37:16.442 --> 37:19.277
Promise?

37:19.445 --> 37:21.821
I promise.

37:21.989 --> 37:24.157
Now I have some things
I need to take care of,

37:24.325 --> 37:26.201
starting downstairs,

37:26.368 --> 37:27.994
some supplies I need
for the dental office.

37:28.162 --> 37:29.913
From our kitchens?

37:30.081 --> 37:32.040
4:00.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.750
Don't be late.

38:55.749 --> 38:58.001
They won't
let me in anymore.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.961
They've changed
the rules.

39:02.256 --> 39:04.674
You're a good boy,
Jimmy.

39:07.970 --> 39:10.263
They say
this place is haunted.

39:10.431 --> 39:15.310
I never took stock in such talk,
but I think it's true.

39:15.477 --> 39:17.979
At night,
you can hear the voices...

39:21.025 --> 39:24.319
...and sometimes
the whips cracking.

39:24.486 --> 39:26.321
It's only dreams,
father.

39:26.488 --> 39:29.616
Maybe God thinks
it's a sin, slavery.

39:29.783 --> 39:32.202
Maybe we're
paying penance now.

39:32.369 --> 39:33.745
It seems
that way at times.

39:33.913 --> 39:38.041
It's...Like
we're being punished.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.043
Progress is being made.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.628
Mcclellan's in retreat.

39:41.795 --> 39:43.671
He's beating it
back to Harrison's landing.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.177
Good.
That's good.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.556
And, father, come closer.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.230
I'm working with some men

40:00.397 --> 40:02.774
who are expert in aiding
the cause -- spies.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.317
We're smuggling goods
for our boys

40:04.485 --> 40:06.027
inside of
Green family coffins.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.654
I intend to go down
with them tonight

40:07.821 --> 40:09.697
to help put an end
to this damn war once and --

40:09.865 --> 40:11.491
are you a fool?

40:11.659 --> 40:13.534
You'll only make
a mess of things, Jimmy.

40:13.702 --> 40:14.702
They are
impressed with me.

40:14.870 --> 40:15.870
They're using you.

40:16.038 --> 40:17.247
They want me
to fight with them.

40:17.414 --> 40:19.958
Your job is here
with the family.

40:20.125 --> 40:22.543
For once in your life, son,
rise to the occasion.

40:22.711 --> 40:24.170
What I do with these men

40:24.338 --> 40:27.340
could help turn the war
in our favor at long last.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.676
Maybe then you will
be proud of me.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.565
This puts us
right under the lobby.

40:49.863 --> 40:51.114
Quiet!

40:54.827 --> 40:56.619
Abel?!

40:57.746 --> 41:00.415
Abel?!

41:00.582 --> 41:03.209
Abel, you down here?!

41:07.256 --> 41:09.090
What in hell's this all a--

41:11.552 --> 41:13.636
Keep going.
They'll be here soon.

41:36.285 --> 41:38.494
How is he?

41:38.662 --> 41:42.081
At least
the pain has passed.

41:42.249 --> 41:45.418
You've done right
by this man.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.879
I can't just leave him.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.714
You mustn't let yourself
be so affected.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.049
I can't!

41:55.929 --> 41:58.473
I sent a telegram to his wife.
I implored her to come.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.645
Pardon me.

42:08.025 --> 42:10.360
They's all lining up
outside.

42:10.527 --> 42:13.404
Yes.
He's on his way.

42:13.572 --> 42:15.948
I's obliged, nurse Mary,

42:16.116 --> 42:20.119
for the mayflower
a-and the lady in Boston.

42:20.287 --> 42:23.289
I'm glad they could
be of use to you.

42:23.457 --> 42:26.209
Y-you hear
any word of Samuel?

42:26.377 --> 42:28.920
I'm sorry. I haven't.

42:29.088 --> 42:31.172
Well, I-If you do,

42:31.340 --> 42:35.635
please tell him where he
can find me, I-If he wishes it.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.973
Godspeed to you.

42:49.108 --> 42:51.109
Mr. Bullen?

42:51.276 --> 42:52.527
Ain't seen him.

42:52.694 --> 42:55.905
Everybody's getting ready
for the visit.

42:56.073 --> 42:57.490
Mr. Bullen?

43:00.411 --> 43:02.453
I come for my pay.

43:02.621 --> 43:03.913
I's owed three weeks worth.

43:04.081 --> 43:06.249
Help.

43:22.349 --> 43:23.808
Help.

43:29.231 --> 43:31.607
Help?

43:31.775 --> 43:34.360
Like you was gonna
help me?

43:49.376 --> 43:51.919
What I'm owed --
no more, no less.

44:00.971 --> 44:04.974
I don't know how you came
to be like this.

44:05.142 --> 44:12.773
All I know is the lord,
he work in mysterious ways.

44:36.715 --> 44:38.007
Will mama be here,
grammy?

44:38.175 --> 44:39.550
Not much further.

44:39.718 --> 44:41.093
Come on.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.598
I was wondering
if you might be feeling

44:45.766 --> 44:47.016
as firm
and articulate today

44:47.184 --> 44:50.436
as you were the other day
when we spoke.

44:50.604 --> 44:53.940
If you were, say,

44:54.107 --> 44:58.736
to find yourself before
president Lincoln himself...

44:58.904 --> 45:00.863
I doubt he'd speak
to someone like me.

45:01.031 --> 45:03.658
Oh, on the contrary.
He might invite it.

45:03.825 --> 45:06.869
I must run out for an engagement
that can't be missed.

45:07.037 --> 45:09.872
And miss this opportunity?
H-he's a fair-minded man.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.959
He may be your best chance of
getting your father out of jail.

45:13.126 --> 45:14.835
Senior staff, line up now.

45:15.921 --> 45:17.004
Quickly!

45:17.172 --> 45:18.464
They have it in for me.
Foster.

45:18.632 --> 45:19.924
The jig is up.

45:20.092 --> 45:21.300
I'll have to go serve
on the front

45:21.468 --> 45:23.177
where the fighting is.
There, there, Byron.

45:23.345 --> 45:25.221
We'll find a way
to right this ship.

46:04.595 --> 46:05.845
Mother.

46:08.974 --> 46:10.391
What's happened?

46:13.729 --> 46:18.649
Your father -- he's being moved
to the old capitol prison.

46:18.817 --> 46:21.193
I fear we shall never
see him again.

47:04.154 --> 47:06.113
Aurelia?
Mama?

47:08.867 --> 47:10.493
Aurelia?

49:20.874 --> 49:22.666
Sign there.

49:37.349 --> 49:41.602
I, Alice Felicity Green,
vow allegiance

49:41.770 --> 49:44.104
to the knights
of the golden circle

49:44.272 --> 49:46.106
and to the government
that will be formed

49:46.274 --> 49:49.777
in a golden Crescent
of slave-owning territories

49:49.945 --> 49:54.490
made from the confederate states
and circling the Gulf of Mexico.

50:02.499 --> 50:04.583
Aurelia!
We're here! Aurelia!

50:04.751 --> 50:07.503
Mama! Mama!

50:47.794 --> 50:49.211
This is your moment.

51:11.276 --> 51:13.903
You're missing
the party.

51:14.070 --> 51:16.530
He won't be long now.

51:27.250 --> 51:29.001
Philip?

51:33.715 --> 51:37.092
Addy...You came.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.344
Philip, it's --

51:38.511 --> 51:40.137
I dreamt you would.

51:42.724 --> 51:47.811
You got no idea...
How much I missed you.

51:54.611 --> 52:00.908
Got too much to bear,
to never see you again...

52:01.076 --> 52:07.081
To die here, alone,

52:07.248 --> 52:10.209
without my lovely...

52:10.377 --> 52:13.379
You will not be alone.

52:43.994 --> 52:46.078
You did all you could.
