08:22.961 --> 08:25.031
What are you trying to do,
kill yourself?

08:27.881 --> 08:29.314
There's something down there!

08:29.561 --> 08:30.630
What was it?

08:31.481 --> 08:32.674
I don't know!

08:32.921 --> 08:37.073
Something grabbed my arm, twisted me
around! Almost pulled my arm off!

08:40.361 --> 08:41.874
Come on, give me this.

08:43.921 --> 08:45.877
Listen, I told you...

08:46.121 --> 08:48.271
...you gotta stay with me.

08:48.561 --> 08:51.280
David, I panicked.

08:55.921 --> 08:57.513
David, I panicked.

08:57.761 --> 09:00.275
Well, listen, you can't panic.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.750
You just gotta learn to relax
and control yourself.

09:14.081 --> 09:15.878
- You all right?
- Yeah.

09:20.441 --> 09:23.080
Actually, David, it's my foot!

09:23.361 --> 09:25.477
The damn thing bit off my entire foot.

09:25.721 --> 09:27.712
Look, it's just a bloody stump.

09:37.161 --> 09:39.072
I almost drowned.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.476
I almost drowned.

09:45.201 --> 09:48.034
We might as well be married
for all the concern I get.

10:00.721 --> 10:02.677
You wanna go dive naked?

10:03.361 --> 10:05.670
In the bathtub, in the hotel?

10:30.641 --> 10:32.279
Gail, look!

10:34.881 --> 10:36.075
Look at this.

10:36.321 --> 10:37.197
What is it?

10:37.441 --> 10:38.874
I don't know.

10:39.441 --> 10:41.079
It looks like a coin.

11:08.161 --> 11:09.480
I'm gonna take a shower.

11:09.681 --> 11:10.875
Okay, baby.

11:18.761 --> 11:22.276
Goliath? I thought you said
you were diving on the Brighton.

11:24.761 --> 11:26.592
We did dive the Brighton.

11:27.201 --> 11:30.830
Then we spotted that wreck,
so we decided we'd take a look.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.272
It wasn't in the guidebook.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.319
You're damn right it's not.
Goliath is full of munitions.

11:37.521 --> 11:40.194
Tourists aren't allowed
to blow themselves up, you know.

11:40.441 --> 11:41.476
Oh, yeah?

11:42.961 --> 11:44.155
Yeah.

12:38.961 --> 12:42.954
I can't believe the stuff Treece
has found off the coast around here.

12:43.361 --> 12:44.271
I can believe it.

12:46.481 --> 12:48.551
- What have we found out?
- I don't know.

12:49.441 --> 12:53.275
O.P.N. means ora pro nobis,
"pray for us."

12:53.521 --> 12:56.274
And "S.C." I can't find
in any of these.

12:57.161 --> 13:00.073
If I'd wanted to spend
my holiday in the library...

13:00.281 --> 13:02.715
...I could've walked 10 blocks
to 42nd Street.

13:03.921 --> 13:05.673
Let's approach this methodically.

13:05.921 --> 13:08.833
- I'd love to play tennis!
- Our coin is dated 1 71 4.

13:09.041 --> 13:13.876
The treasure ships that went down then
were King Philip's fleet in 1715.

13:14.121 --> 13:18.239
- Ping Pong!
- That's fantastic, 30 million in gold!

13:20.161 --> 13:22.152
I'm gonna play tennis with a pro.

13:32.881 --> 13:33.870
No.

13:36.721 --> 13:37.915
All right.

13:54.281 --> 13:55.111
Wine, madam?

13:55.361 --> 13:56.680
No, thank you.

13:57.561 --> 13:59.677
Would you care for some more, sir?

14:00.081 --> 14:02.879
- Would you like some dessert?
- No, thank you.

14:05.161 --> 14:08.676
It was here, outside the wreck,
where I almost had my arm torn off.

14:09.521 --> 14:13.116
If you were there, I was across
the hull, in about 80 feet of water.

14:13.361 --> 14:15.352
That's where I found that coin.

14:18.921 --> 14:22.197
You must be the young couple
who found that bottle today?

14:22.401 --> 14:25.871
Smallish? Three inches long? Tapered?

14:27.561 --> 14:32.157
It could be Reinhardt glass, you know,
from Rotterdam, before the war.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.720
- It didn't look like...
- We didn't find any bottle.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.274
Wait...

14:45.361 --> 14:47.317
My name is Henri Bondurant.

14:47.561 --> 14:49.040
A jeweler by trade.

14:49.241 --> 14:53.757
By avocation, a collector
of rare and unusual glass.

14:54.321 --> 14:55.515
You see...

14:56.001 --> 14:59.118
...the government here has rather
strict rules about diving.

14:59.321 --> 15:01.710
Legally, you cannot take
anything off Bermuda...

15:01.961 --> 15:05.271
...unless you first offer it
to the government and they decline.

15:05.481 --> 15:08.234
Unfortunately, the government
rarely ever declines...

15:08.441 --> 15:11.592
...and even more rarely
offers premium prices.

15:14.441 --> 15:15.999
What was your name?

15:16.241 --> 15:17.310
Bondurant.

15:17.561 --> 15:18.880
Well...

15:19.241 --> 15:22.916
...l'm sorry. This is fascinating,
but what does it have to do with us?

15:25.681 --> 15:27.273
Let me tell you something.

15:28.041 --> 15:31.113
If that bottle is a genuine Reinhardt...

15:31.361 --> 15:35.070
...it would be a small coup
for a collector like myself.

15:35.281 --> 15:37.112
I would be prepared to offer...

15:37.321 --> 15:39.881
I'm sorry. I told you,
we don't have any bottle.

15:45.561 --> 15:47.279
In that case...

15:48.081 --> 15:51.676
...my apologies for having interrupted
your conversation.

15:51.921 --> 15:53.115
Good night.

15:55.241 --> 15:56.435
Good night.

15:58.681 --> 16:00.478
Jesus, who was that?

16:01.921 --> 16:05.516
Some dynamite businessman you are.
You could've listened to his offer.

16:05.761 --> 16:08.434
Come on, Gail!
Bottle collector, my ass!

16:47.041 --> 16:47.871
Is this it?

16:49.561 --> 16:51.870
Well, it isn't a bloody tourist trap.

16:53.081 --> 16:54.070
What do you want?

16:54.281 --> 16:55.839
- Mr. Treece?
- Indeed.

16:56.921 --> 17:01.119
A friend of ours was doing some diving
around here about a month ago...

17:01.361 --> 17:04.717
...and found a Spanish coin.
It was dated 1 71 4.

17:04.961 --> 17:06.713
And he told us to talk to you.

17:06.961 --> 17:11.272
- Look it up in the Hamilton Library.
- We did, and we talked to the librarian.

17:11.481 --> 17:14.314
She said to come out here
because you'd help us.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.711
Yes, well, she's a stupid woman.

17:16.961 --> 17:19.191
But she's kind, you know. Quite kind.

17:19.441 --> 17:21.396
Is she still growing her mustache?

17:26.161 --> 17:28.310
Come on in.
Let's see what you've got.

17:37.481 --> 17:40.598
Come on over, then.
But you haven't been asked for lunch.

17:45.561 --> 17:46.755
Thank you.

18:20.561 --> 18:24.634
Well, it ain't no coin, boy.
It's a Spanish medallion.

18:24.841 --> 18:26.274
It's a medallion?

18:27.641 --> 18:29.074
Beginner's luck.

18:29.321 --> 18:34.156
If this hadn't laid against iron,
it would've oxidized a long time ago.

18:34.521 --> 18:38.992
We can't figure out the inscription
ora pro nobis and "S.C." in front.

18:39.721 --> 18:44.476
"Santa Clara pray for us." That was
a common inscription in those days.

18:47.321 --> 18:48.390
There you are, boy.

18:48.641 --> 18:49.869
Is it valuable?

18:50.121 --> 18:52.681
One medallion? No, not to me.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.957
It must be one
of King Philip's treasure.

18:56.161 --> 18:58.152
That's the only fleet
that went down then.

18:58.361 --> 19:01.592
Not unless it walked itself
across the ocean 800 miles.

19:01.841 --> 19:06.596
That fleet went down in a hurricane
off Florida. All 11 of them. 1715.

19:06.801 --> 19:08.917
That's all documented in my library.

19:09.121 --> 19:12.193
They've already found El Capitano,
Ubilla's flagship.

19:12.441 --> 19:14.830
There's something down here also,
isn't there?

19:15.041 --> 19:18.477
Now just hang on a bit, boy.
You just found one trinket.

19:18.681 --> 19:21.036
Might be enough to pay for your holiday.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.956
Or it might've just
fallen overboard...

19:24.121 --> 19:26.476
...dropped there by some
drunken old rummy.

19:26.841 --> 19:29.071
What else
have you got in there, then?

19:37.161 --> 19:39.470
Hey, boy, this is Goliath trash.

19:40.041 --> 19:42.271
What the hell were you doing
diving there?

19:42.481 --> 19:45.279
We spotted the wreck
off the point, so we dived down.

19:52.361 --> 19:54.079
Where'd you get this, exactly?

20:02.001 --> 20:03.992
Right here. Just outside the wreck.

20:04.201 --> 20:05.793
You quite sure?

20:06.041 --> 20:10.796
The water plays tricks. It makes things
look bigger, smaller, wrong way around.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.157
- Are you sure it was there?
- I'm positive.

20:13.361 --> 20:15.511
Sure a lot of glass freaks
in Bermuda.

20:15.721 --> 20:17.677
Somebody else know about this?

20:20.641 --> 20:23.792
A bald guy came up to us
and said he was a glass collector.

20:24.041 --> 20:25.793
He described that perfectly.

20:26.841 --> 20:28.399
I didn't show it to him.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.751
Looked like a basketball player.

20:32.121 --> 20:33.839
Henri Bondurant. French guy.

20:34.241 --> 20:35.754
No, he's Haitian.

20:36.001 --> 20:40.358
Boy, could I just have another little
look at that medallion there?

20:43.201 --> 20:45.271
I think I might just have...

20:45.961 --> 20:47.314
...missed something here.

20:47.601 --> 20:51.150
Come over here, and let's have
a look with this magnifying glass.

20:54.401 --> 20:55.595
Yeah.

20:57.401 --> 21:00.234
See those letters?
That's not your normal mint mark.

21:00.441 --> 21:04.798
It might be the mark of the engraver
or the person who had it made up.

21:05.041 --> 21:06.872
I'm sure of one thing.

21:07.121 --> 21:09.760
It's made up for somebody special.

21:11.041 --> 21:13.555
Then it might be worth
another look down there.

21:13.761 --> 21:16.753
Yes, well, as I said, it might...

21:16.961 --> 21:18.155
...but not to me.

21:18.841 --> 21:21.150
Thank you.
Sorry you can't stay for lunch.

21:21.361 --> 21:23.192
Wait a minute. That's all?

21:23.401 --> 21:24.959
- Let's go.
- Just a second.

21:25.201 --> 21:29.319
You might not mind wasting your time,
but I can't have you wasting mine.

21:29.521 --> 21:31.955
You said there's something special.
Let's look!

21:32.161 --> 21:33.753
Good afternoon!

22:04.961 --> 22:06.360
You okay?

22:19.841 --> 22:21.035
Go right!

22:26.601 --> 22:28.273
I wonder what this guy's doing? I

22:36.921 --> 22:38.320
Try and pull over!

22:38.961 --> 22:40.030
I can't!

24:00.961 --> 24:03.350
You should have sold me that bottle.

24:04.121 --> 24:07.431
Now you've forced me to take
what you would not let me pay for.

24:10.441 --> 24:13.478
If it'll ease your mind,
I'll still name a price.

24:17.761 --> 24:19.558
Take off their blindfolds.

24:55.321 --> 24:58.358
Look, if it's not in the bag,
I don't know where it is.

25:02.401 --> 25:03.197
The girl.

25:03.401 --> 25:05.357
Now, look, she hasn't got it!

25:06.801 --> 25:08.473
If his tongue moves, cut it!

25:49.521 --> 25:50.715
I'll do it.

27:04.441 --> 27:05.396
Put it back on.

27:17.001 --> 27:20.073
Since neither of you seem
to have that bottle, I assume...

27:20.281 --> 27:23.000
...it is now the property
of Romer Treece.

27:23.321 --> 27:25.960
Well, then, for Christ's sake,
let him go!

27:29.961 --> 27:33.271
It hasn't been all that pleasant
for you, has it Mr. Sanders?

27:34.441 --> 27:36.750
Enjoy yourselves this evening.

27:37.401 --> 27:39.357
Eat a good dinner.

27:39.561 --> 27:41.552
Go dancing.

27:42.841 --> 27:45.958
But be off the island by tomorrow.

27:56.801 --> 27:57.995
Treece!

28:00.121 --> 28:01.759
Come on, Treece!

28:03.201 --> 28:05.761
All right, what the hell's going on?

28:06.121 --> 28:07.236
Take it up.

28:07.441 --> 28:09.557
We'll take it out right after this.

28:17.841 --> 28:19.035
Coffin?

28:23.681 --> 28:27.356
He's the only man alive who might know
one of these ampoules on sight.

28:28.001 --> 28:29.320
Can I show him your map?

28:29.521 --> 28:32.399
He's the sole survivor
of the Goliath, you see.

28:36.921 --> 28:38.115
Thank you.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.353
Now, then, Adam...

28:42.961 --> 28:45.555
...this one of your legendary ampoules?

28:54.961 --> 28:57.156
It's the real thing, all right.

29:00.361 --> 29:03.353
The old girl's finally
lost her virginity.

29:04.321 --> 29:06.551
My friends found it there.

29:10.801 --> 29:13.952
The way she's lying,
the storm must've flipped her around.

29:14.641 --> 29:17.474
She was never this close
to the edge of the reef before.

29:20.321 --> 29:21.754
You're lucky.

29:22.001 --> 29:24.390
Five people have died
over the last 30 years...

29:24.601 --> 29:26.956
...trying to crawl inside that ship.

29:27.241 --> 29:29.471
Blew themselves up
poking torches around.

29:30.121 --> 29:32.999
There's enough live ammo there
to blow up the island.

29:33.241 --> 29:36.438
Will somebody cut the crap?
Blew themselves up for what?

29:36.761 --> 29:41.198
It was a military ship. It went down
with munitions and medical supplies.

29:41.441 --> 29:42.760
Or so they say.

29:42.961 --> 29:43.996
They're there.

29:44.201 --> 29:45.520
All right, what's there?

29:50.561 --> 29:51.516
Morphine.

29:51.961 --> 29:54.156
Ninety-eight thousand ampoules.

29:54.361 --> 29:56.192
I packed them myself.

29:56.441 --> 29:58.557
Jesus, why didn't you tell us the truth?

29:58.761 --> 30:01.639
We wouldn't have had that run-in
with the Haitian.

30:02.041 --> 30:03.997
The name's Cloche.

30:04.201 --> 30:06.396
The fact that you knew nothing
saved you.

30:06.601 --> 30:08.956
I wasn't sure myself until now.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.950
It's the first time
he's told me the truth!

30:12.241 --> 30:15.916
Adam, what do you reckon happened
to the rest of them, then?

30:18.161 --> 30:21.756
They're probably all smashed up
by the ordnance now.

30:23.961 --> 30:28.751
The way she's lying, there won't be any
steel plate to have to burrow through.

30:29.241 --> 30:32.756
They've performed an autopsy on it
with everything but forceps...

30:32.961 --> 30:34.952
...but nobody found one of those before.

30:35.441 --> 30:36.556
We found one.

30:36.801 --> 30:39.361
Well, we are having a wonderful day,
aren't we?

30:40.321 --> 30:41.959
How come nobody found one?

30:42.201 --> 30:44.840
The sea's a joke, my boy.
Loves to fool you.

30:45.041 --> 30:48.556
Dive one day, you find nothing.
That night, it blows up a storm.

30:48.761 --> 30:52.151
Go back again, the same spot,
you find a carpet of golden coin.

30:52.401 --> 30:55.996
We just had one of the worst storms
we had in 10 years, haven't we?

30:56.241 --> 30:57.230
Coffin?

30:57.441 --> 30:59.352
Goddamn it! Coffin!

30:59.601 --> 31:02.354
"Coffin! Goddamn it! Coffin!"

31:03.641 --> 31:05.393
Nice to meet you folks.

31:14.641 --> 31:18.031
Mr. Treece, which one of us turns
this over to the government?

31:21.721 --> 31:25.316
Well, now, miss,
I'm gonna have to think on that.

31:26.201 --> 31:29.034
I was never much one to bother
with formalities.

31:29.241 --> 31:33.200
Morphine's not exactly a "formality."
It's halfway to heroin.

31:33.441 --> 31:34.271
Halfway to hell.

31:35.001 --> 31:37.469
I know all about that. So does Cloche.

31:37.721 --> 31:41.999
By the time a Hamilton bureaucrat gets
off of his fat bum, it will be heroin.

31:44.801 --> 31:46.917
That's why I'm gonna dive there tonight.

31:48.441 --> 31:49.920
You haven't answered my question.

31:54.441 --> 31:57.160
I'll answer.
I'm turning this over to the government.

31:57.401 --> 32:00.074
I'm all the government you need, boyl

32:04.241 --> 32:05.993
Put that right back.

32:18.081 --> 32:20.072
The reasons are two:
mine and yours.

32:20.321 --> 32:21.276
Mine:

32:21.481 --> 32:25.440
If there are thousands of ampoules there
and Cloche gets them...

32:25.641 --> 32:28.394
...that junk will be on the street
in N.Y. in a week.

32:28.641 --> 32:31.633
Yours: If you're lucky,
that's the only one left.

32:32.361 --> 32:35.558
If you go to the government,
your treasure hunt will be off.

32:35.761 --> 32:37.717
And if there is any treasure...

32:38.201 --> 32:41.352
...you'll just be reading
about somebody else finding it.

32:47.841 --> 32:49.559
David, please don't dive.

32:51.121 --> 32:52.554
Make up your own mind, boy.

32:54.241 --> 32:55.640
I have made up my mind.

32:55.841 --> 32:57.991
I'm diving with you tonight...

32:58.241 --> 33:01.916
...or otherwise I'm handing over
this information to the authorities.

33:12.841 --> 33:16.277
Look, Gail, it's important to me.
You understand?

33:16.481 --> 33:18.472
David, it's morphine. Morphine!

33:18.681 --> 33:21.991
We only met the man today.
You don't know anything about him.

33:23.121 --> 33:26.397
- I can't pass it up. It's an experience.
- Experience?

33:26.601 --> 33:29.991
Don't you mean privilege?
He suckered you in like a child!

33:30.201 --> 33:31.953
I blackmailed him, remember?

33:32.201 --> 33:35.830
- Is that the way you remember it?
- Yes, because that's the way it was!

33:37.041 --> 33:39.839
There's treasure down there. I know.
I've gotta look.

33:40.041 --> 33:43.351
You're so blind! You wouldn't
see it if it was in front of you!

33:43.601 --> 33:46.161
I feel things so I do them!
That's the way I am!

33:46.401 --> 33:48.357
And you wind up with T-shirts!

33:50.161 --> 33:53.153
Jesus, that's unfair.
That's totally unfair.

33:54.001 --> 33:57.391
Look, I didn't come here for you.
I came here for us!

33:57.601 --> 33:59.353
Would you please think about it?

34:02.321 --> 34:04.357
I always think about us.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.389
Say, who is that guy?
I don't like him at all.

34:28.641 --> 34:31.792
Learn to like him, because
that's Kevin. He's family.

34:32.041 --> 34:35.158
My mother liked him.
Told him to look after me.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.159
Put your gear in the cabin.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.840
Well, here I am!

34:39.841 --> 34:42.674
I'm all ready! I've got all my gear!

34:42.920 --> 34:46.755
I'm sorry you had such a long walk.
You're not diving tonight.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.553
The hell I'm not!

34:49.801 --> 34:52.952
That's my ship out there!
Those are my mates!

34:53.400 --> 34:56.552
Your ship's dead. So are your mates.

34:56.801 --> 34:59.235
So were you,
when I found you on the beach.

35:00.041 --> 35:02.953
But there's never the bringing
any of us back, is there?

35:03.441 --> 35:04.590
Just go on home now.

35:05.361 --> 35:06.555
Good night.

35:07.441 --> 35:08.760
All set, Kevin?

35:22.441 --> 35:26.354
Full moon tonight. We're gonna
stick out like a cherry on a cream pie.

35:27.361 --> 35:29.352
Cast her off forward, Kev.

35:49.241 --> 35:50.469
Would you like some rum?

35:51.361 --> 35:52.350
Yeah.

35:58.521 --> 36:02.150
- Here you go.
- I never drink before I dive.

36:05.921 --> 36:08.196
You know what they say
about these waters?

36:08.401 --> 36:10.596
If the Jamaican pirates don't get you...

36:10.841 --> 36:13.753
...it'll be the cold embrace of the sea.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.550
And that's no lover's kiss.

36:20.601 --> 36:23.991
Every ship from the new world
passed through these waters.

36:24.241 --> 36:25.594
They had to.

36:26.241 --> 36:29.153
K'ang Hsi porcelain from China.

36:29.401 --> 36:31.790
Japanese silk-screens.

36:32.041 --> 36:34.874
And those ivory doodads from India.

36:35.081 --> 36:39.154
And all that Inca gold
that Pizarro took out of Peru.

36:43.361 --> 36:45.352
Do you believe all that, boy?

36:47.001 --> 36:48.753
Yeah, I believe all of it.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.757
Every bit of it. So do you.

36:57.601 --> 36:59.956
You gonna marry that girl of yours?

37:13.841 --> 37:15.035
Hey, boy.

37:16.121 --> 37:17.440
We're getting very close.

37:19.521 --> 37:21.591
Four dots and a dash, that's your hotel.

37:24.441 --> 37:25.635
Hey, Treece.

37:27.041 --> 37:28.918
What do you do on a foggy night?

37:29.721 --> 37:32.155
I just stay home and I drink rum.

38:00.041 --> 38:00.951
Here.

38:01.201 --> 38:02.759
Give me a hand, will you?

38:13.121 --> 38:16.955
Wait a minute. I don't want to have
anything to do with explosives.

38:17.841 --> 38:21.072
If there are thousands of ampoules
down there...

38:21.321 --> 38:22.959
I'm gonna rig the Goliath...

38:23.201 --> 38:27.831
...so that I topple her off the reef,
out of anybody's reach forever.

38:28.161 --> 38:29.435
What about the treasure?

38:29.761 --> 38:33.356
Here, you'll need this.
It's black as molasses.

38:33.641 --> 38:36.360
Don't you go threatening
anything down there.

47:55.361 --> 47:56.874
What's wrong?

47:58.481 --> 48:00.312
I'm not blowing it. Not now.

48:00.521 --> 48:02.796
That's the biggest moray eel
I ever saw!

48:03.041 --> 48:05.077
He wanted you for his supper.

49:33.081 --> 49:34.673
What's the matter, boy?

49:39.561 --> 49:42.519
Cheap Jack Bush.
Warning from Cloche.

49:42.761 --> 49:44.319
Cheap Jack what?

49:44.521 --> 49:48.116
Voodoo. Cloche always likes
to bring in a bit of Haiti with him.

49:48.361 --> 49:50.670
Anybody take any notice of this...

49:52.761 --> 49:55.275
...ought to have his brain examined.

49:57.961 --> 50:00.475
The lights in your hotel
have gone out.

50:03.201 --> 50:05.476
We'll run the reef
and drop you on the beach.

50:05.721 --> 50:08.440
Get that anchor up.
Keep a sharp eye!

50:19.681 --> 50:20.511
David?

50:25.561 --> 50:27.677
Just a minute.
I've put the lock on.

50:33.561 --> 50:34.880
Who's there?

50:56.761 --> 51:00.037
- You gotta go starboard.
- Port! Port!

51:00.281 --> 51:02.033
I've been through this reef before.

51:02.441 --> 51:04.591
Yeah, but the hotel beach
is over there!

51:04.801 --> 51:07.873
I know where the bloody beach is!

51:31.721 --> 51:33.473
Okay, you're clear!

55:12.641 --> 55:14.393
Honey, what happened?

55:17.601 --> 55:19.398
I've never...

55:24.281 --> 55:27.398
...felt like that...

55:28.201 --> 55:30.999
...in my entire life!

55:31.601 --> 55:34.399
I was so helpless!

55:42.081 --> 55:43.594
All right.

55:44.681 --> 55:46.433
They...

55:46.681 --> 55:49.195
They painted me.

55:54.441 --> 55:55.237
Quiet.

55:55.441 --> 55:56.999
They painted...

55:59.001 --> 56:01.356
Come on. Listen, listen.

56:01.561 --> 56:04.075
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, baby.

56:05.361 --> 56:07.033
We'll go home tonight.

56:07.561 --> 56:08.755
The airport's closed.

56:08.961 --> 56:12.192
No way off the island.
You'd best come home with me.

56:13.001 --> 56:15.117
I'm not going home with you, Treece.

56:15.361 --> 56:17.829
Because it's you and it's Cloche...

56:18.081 --> 56:21.391
...and it's that morphine
that almost got her killed tonight!

56:22.681 --> 56:26.799
Boy, if Cloche wanted her dead,
we'd be digging her grave by now.

56:28.161 --> 56:30.755
He just wanted her
as some kind of trump card...

56:30.961 --> 56:33.395
...until he knew about the morphine.

56:34.441 --> 56:38.912
Come home with me. St. David is
the only place you'll be safe tonight.

56:44.721 --> 56:47.713
Don't worry. I'll make sure
everyone's placed properly.

56:47.961 --> 56:50.236
Right. But you watch the west side.

56:50.481 --> 56:52.915
Make sure nobody comes
over the swing bridge.

56:53.161 --> 56:55.994
If he does come,
I hope it's my bloody way.

56:56.601 --> 56:57.795
Kevin?

56:59.401 --> 57:00.800
Take care of yourself.

57:01.001 --> 57:03.799
I don't want anybody else
to be hurt tonight. Go on!

57:33.201 --> 57:34.793
How's your girl?

57:36.681 --> 57:38.194
She's asleep.

58:00.201 --> 58:01.998
Why didn't you blow that boat up?

58:03.361 --> 58:07.593
Because of what you found, boy. I think
you ought to have a look at this.

58:10.881 --> 58:13.031
I never seen one like that before.

58:14.001 --> 58:16.674
That's an 18th-century
escutcheon plate.

58:19.441 --> 58:23.798
You might be right. There just might be
a king's ransom down there.

58:26.481 --> 58:30.599
It would take three keys to open
the box that that plate came from.

58:32.081 --> 58:33.639
The captain would have one.

58:34.681 --> 58:36.592
The governor of Havana had two.

58:36.841 --> 58:39.071
Only the owner would have all three.

58:39.281 --> 58:42.000
So only the owner could open it
on his own, right?

58:43.881 --> 58:47.874
Three-key lock like that is very rare.
Very rare, indeed.

58:48.241 --> 58:50.596
Only used on nobility business.

58:51.081 --> 58:55.871
What would a plate like this be doing
in a World War II munition ship?

58:56.641 --> 58:58.597
Yes, well, now...

58:59.081 --> 59:00.594
I don't know.

59:02.601 --> 59:06.514
Suppose you have two storms...

59:06.761 --> 59:10.640
...hundreds of years apart,
springing up from the same quarter...

59:11.561 --> 59:15.349
...and they catch two ships,
making for the same shelter.

59:15.561 --> 59:18.394
Might they not drive them up
on the same reef?

59:20.041 --> 59:24.478
You think the current could bring that
plate up through a split in the hull?

59:26.401 --> 59:28.073
Why hasn't anybody found it?

59:28.281 --> 59:32.035
I don't know, but we're gonna
find it in the Havana manifest.

59:32.241 --> 59:33.469
I got survivors' accounts.

59:33.681 --> 59:37.640
I ought to be able to tell you
who that ship is, where she come from.

59:37.881 --> 59:40.395
These are the Spanish.
This is the translation.

59:41.561 --> 59:43.392
You and your beginner's luck.

59:48.001 --> 59:50.913
If there is something,
what would it take to bring it up?

59:52.281 --> 59:54.476
Well, under normal circumstances...

59:54.641 --> 59:57.030
...using a sand gun
and DESCO equipment...

59:57.281 --> 01:00:00.398
...clear water and a lot of luck,
just a few days.

01:00:00.881 --> 01:00:04.430
But that hardly applies now,
since we've got Cloche on our back.

01:00:05.481 --> 01:00:07.790
What would it take to get him off?

01:00:08.041 --> 01:00:10.396
Any deal that gets him the morphine,
I suppose.

01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:17.190
But what do you care? You're both
going home tomorrow, aren't you?

01:00:17.441 --> 01:00:22.151
You'll be up to your neck in city smut
by dinnertimel What a world that is!

01:00:23.441 --> 01:00:26.194
They made me climb
the Statue of Liberty once.

01:00:35.441 --> 01:00:37.193
It's dreams, Treece.

01:00:38.081 --> 01:00:39.116
It's all daydreams.

01:00:41.281 --> 01:00:44.398
It's more than daydreams
when you find a three-lock box.

01:00:46.561 --> 01:00:48.279
By rights, you discovered her.

01:00:49.801 --> 01:00:52.395
Whoever she is,
you were the first to find her.

01:00:53.241 --> 01:00:57.393
But you would have left that plate there
if I hadn't known it for what it was.

01:00:58.681 --> 01:01:01.400
So that rolls me aboard as well.

01:01:03.841 --> 01:01:05.593
Let me put it to you simple:

01:01:05.801 --> 01:01:10.317
Whatever's down there, a lot
or a little, half yours, half mine...

01:01:10.561 --> 01:01:14.190
...but the right to tell the world
about it, that's all yours.

01:01:24.001 --> 01:01:25.798
Come on to bed.

01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:28.592
All right, in a minute. I'm coming.

01:01:43.881 --> 01:01:45.473
You still there, girl?

01:01:47.401 --> 01:01:48.390
Like a jar?

01:01:49.361 --> 01:01:50.794
It'll warm you up.

01:01:56.801 --> 01:01:57.995
Anyway...

01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:01.992
...rum is not drinking, it's surviving.

01:02:04.681 --> 01:02:06.592
You know what's got me stumped?

01:02:07.881 --> 01:02:10.634
This is the Havana manifest
right here.

01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:14.317
It's signed by the king's man
in Havana, the Marqués of Cazaterras...

01:02:14.561 --> 01:02:15.914
...governor of Cuba.

01:02:16.161 --> 01:02:20.234
It states here that, "...entire fleet
sunk off the coast of Florida in 1 715."

01:02:20.481 --> 01:02:24.394
That's King Philip's Fleet, 1 715.
Every ship, right?

01:02:24.641 --> 01:02:27.201
All itemized. All recorded.

01:02:28.241 --> 01:02:30.391
So what I don't understand is...

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.515
...what is this ship
doing in these waters...

01:02:33.761 --> 01:02:37.640
...un-itemized, unrecorded, unescorted...

01:02:37.881 --> 01:02:40.190
...and carrying a three-lock box?

01:02:47.081 --> 01:02:49.390
He's all right, that David of yours.

01:02:51.881 --> 01:02:53.200
Yeah, I know.

01:03:45.881 --> 01:03:47.200
I'm sorry.

01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:51.753
I apologize.

01:03:54.641 --> 01:03:57.394
I lost touch why
we even came down here.

01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:03.993
I'll take you home.

01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:10.997
You don't want to go home tomorrow.

01:04:14.881 --> 01:04:17.190
I don't wanna stay here without you.

01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:22.753
Say that again.

01:04:23.361 --> 01:04:25.795
I don't wanna stay here without you.

01:05:40.081 --> 01:05:41.799
Go away, will you?

01:06:02.601 --> 01:06:06.594
That was a stupid business last night.
And cruel. Very cruel.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.031
You did not go to the police.

01:06:10.281 --> 01:06:13.796
I've been tossing and turning
all night, wondering why.

01:06:15.441 --> 01:06:19.036
Because there's thousands of ampoules
of morphine down there.

01:06:19.281 --> 01:06:21.397
You want them, and I got them.

01:06:22.641 --> 01:06:27.556
They're still on the Goliath. You have
nothing but the gall to claim ownership.

01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:32.434
I rigged that ship
with booby traps last night.

01:06:32.681 --> 01:06:36.833
She's wired 10 ways to hell. The wrong
person goes there, she'll blow.

01:06:39.441 --> 01:06:40.794
You'd need an advantage...

01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:42.997
...to deal with me.

01:06:46.801 --> 01:06:48.792
I'll expect them in two days.

01:06:49.041 --> 01:06:50.793
No, I shall need four.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:53.794
We seemed to have settled on three.

01:06:57.241 --> 01:07:00.790
What sort of fee are you getting
for diving these days?

01:07:01.001 --> 01:07:05.040
One million dollars, cash,
low denominations. That's my share.

01:07:05.281 --> 01:07:08.114
You'll make twice as much as that
in America.

01:07:11.241 --> 01:07:14.278
Your attitude on drugs
is a matter of record.

01:07:14.481 --> 01:07:16.790
Why sell them to me for a profit?

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:19.550
I have my reasons.

01:07:22.081 --> 01:07:26.393
I don't want any interference in
this dive. I know you'll be watching.

01:07:26.601 --> 01:07:28.432
The young couple's my responsibility.

01:07:28.641 --> 01:07:30.597
You keep your hands off them.

01:07:30.801 --> 01:07:31.995
If you want me...

01:07:32.241 --> 01:07:36.393
...you come and see me this time.
You know where I live.

01:07:39.481 --> 01:07:41.119
Three days, Treece.

01:07:42.281 --> 01:07:43.600
Three days.

01:07:44.281 --> 01:07:45.509
Afternoon, Mr. Cloche.

01:08:02.201 --> 01:08:03.600
Thank you, Kev.

01:08:04.801 --> 01:08:06.996
Now then, listen you two.

01:08:07.881 --> 01:08:09.599
When this air gun gets going...

01:08:09.841 --> 01:08:12.878
...I want you on my right
and you on my left, girl.

01:08:13.441 --> 01:08:16.638
We pick up the ampoules
as the sand gets sucked away.

01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:18.599
Be very careful of your hands.

01:08:18.841 --> 01:08:22.435
When this thing's on full,
it can swallow a cannon ball.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.194
How much of that junk
are we gonna bring up?

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:29.390
Just enough to satisfy our audience
up there on the cliff.

01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:31.631
They're there, all right.

01:08:36.401 --> 01:08:40.394
That Kevin sure gives me the willies.
He doesn't say much.

01:08:41.161 --> 01:08:44.278
Maybe he don't like you, Adam.
He likes me.

01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:48.520
He's family. You just watch that
little lever on that compressor there.

01:08:48.761 --> 01:08:52.800
Turn it off if there's any real trouble,
but don't forget to turn it on again.

01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:57.033
You feel that breeze cutting out
of your hose, come up. But be careful.

01:08:57.281 --> 01:09:00.716
It's possible there might be
somebody waiting up there for you.

01:09:00.921 --> 01:09:02.832
It should be me going down there.

01:09:03.081 --> 01:09:04.832
Let's not go into it again.

01:09:05.041 --> 01:09:07.714
I got enough trouble
looking after the boy here.

01:09:07.961 --> 01:09:10.680
Don't worry.
I'm gonna go slow enough for you.

01:09:16.841 --> 01:09:18.433
I'm going in!

01:09:56.041 --> 01:09:57.235
Gail's behind us.

01:09:57.481 --> 01:10:02.396
Get closer! I can't hear you!
You'll have to shout!

01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:37.397
All right, David.
Now keep those air hoses clear.

01:10:37.881 --> 01:10:38.916
Right.

01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:45.310
You go down. I'll be right behind you.

01:12:16.401 --> 01:12:17.993
Wait! Wait!

01:12:20.561 --> 01:12:22.995
That's where we saw the eel.

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:45.955
Come on.

01:13:10.681 --> 01:13:15.197
David, bring it
into the next compartment!

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:41.795
Keep your hands clear, girl!

01:14:54.561 --> 01:14:57.758
That's enough.
Let's go look for the treasure.

01:14:59.241 --> 01:15:02.153
Let's go look for the treasure!

01:15:02.841 --> 01:15:04.433
All right!

01:15:15.241 --> 01:15:16.833
Goliath is moving!

01:17:04.241 --> 01:17:05.435
Kevin!

01:17:31.281 --> 01:17:33.749
Girl, you wait! I'll go!

01:18:27.001 --> 01:18:29.310
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

01:18:29.841 --> 01:18:31.559
Look what I found! Look!

01:18:31.801 --> 01:18:34.793
I don't care!
That was a bloody amateur thing to do!

01:18:35.041 --> 01:18:37.555
I had to take my mask off.
I couldn't reach it!

01:18:37.761 --> 01:18:39.752
Damn it, look at it!

01:18:42.281 --> 01:18:44.158
Gail, look. It's gold!

01:18:45.561 --> 01:18:48.155
I knew there was treasure down here!

01:19:15.041 --> 01:19:17.350
What kind of a ship was it?

01:19:17.641 --> 01:19:19.438
Probably Spanish.

01:19:19.641 --> 01:19:21.393
Might be a galleon.

01:19:21.641 --> 01:19:24.155
Till you fell through the Goliath...

01:19:24.361 --> 01:19:26.829
...this cave was all sealed up.

01:19:27.041 --> 01:19:28.838
That tunnel I pulled you out of...

01:19:29.041 --> 01:19:32.351
...it probably leads right down
to the bottom of the reef.

01:19:45.161 --> 01:19:46.594
Let's get out of here.

01:19:46.841 --> 01:19:50.356
Goliath is on the move again.
It'll cut our hoses.

01:19:50.561 --> 01:19:53.359
Up now! Up! Up!

01:20:02.961 --> 01:20:05.395
- How many do you reckon we have?
- About 4,000.

01:20:05.641 --> 01:20:07.154
Here you go, Kev.

01:20:09.241 --> 01:20:12.153
Explosives?
What the hell you doing that for?

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:14.796
- I'm rigging this.
- What the hell for?

01:20:15.041 --> 01:20:17.601
This is the first place
anybody'd look for them.

01:20:17.841 --> 01:20:21.595
If you'd hide them somewhere else, you
wouldn't have to blow your house up.

01:20:21.841 --> 01:20:25.550
If I hide them somewhere else, they
wouldn't know where to look for them.

01:20:28.641 --> 01:20:30.677
I'm only gonna
keep the buggers two days.

01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:37.435
Kev...

01:20:37.721 --> 01:20:41.555
You stay ashore from now on.
Somebody's got to watch this place.

01:20:42.001 --> 01:20:43.195
Right.

01:20:46.321 --> 01:20:48.881
The hell! It still makes no sense!

01:20:50.601 --> 01:20:51.795
What?

01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:58.350
We know that the Grifon is the wreck
underneath the Goliath, right?

01:20:58.601 --> 01:20:59.795
Right.

01:21:01.641 --> 01:21:03.757
But it says here in the manifest...

01:21:04.001 --> 01:21:07.710
...that the Grifon was a tobacco
ship with a French captain, Dare.

01:21:07.921 --> 01:21:11.391
It tagged along with the 1715
fleet for protection from pirates.

01:21:11.641 --> 01:21:14.075
That's here in the manifest.

01:21:14.841 --> 01:21:16.752
You know what interests me?

01:21:16.961 --> 01:21:19.634
The Grifon was the only ship
to survive the hurricane.

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:21.433
She went back for repairs.

01:21:21.641 --> 01:21:26.556
But what's she doing off of Bermuda
with part of that fleet's treasure?

01:21:26.801 --> 01:21:30.999
I don't know! That's what I keep trying
to puzzle out, because it says here:

01:21:31.241 --> 01:21:35.280
"The entire fleet went down
off Florida together, all 11 ships."

01:21:35.481 --> 01:21:38.359
They say the fleet treasure
was aboard the flagship.

01:21:40.241 --> 01:21:42.357
The manifests prove it!

01:21:43.521 --> 01:21:48.151
Governor Cazaterrass, the king's man
in Havana, reports everything's lost.

01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:52.477
- Maybe he's wrong.
- No.

01:21:52.681 --> 01:21:57.072
What we found is jewelry. We didn't
find the gold and silver from the fleet.

01:21:57.281 --> 01:22:01.433
Jewelry and a Spanish three-lock box
on a French tagalong tobacco ship.

01:22:01.641 --> 01:22:04.394
Well, someone could be lying.
Could be lying!

01:22:04.601 --> 01:22:07.195
The Spanish were fanatics
for accurate records.

01:22:07.401 --> 01:22:11.679
They always had everything checked and
rechecked by some important official.

01:22:11.921 --> 01:22:13.036
Here it is again.

01:22:13.521 --> 01:22:14.715
What?

01:22:15.721 --> 01:22:17.154
"E.F."

01:22:24.801 --> 01:22:25.790
Look at that!

01:22:28.001 --> 01:22:29.957
What's something like that worth?

01:22:31.041 --> 01:22:34.829
I don't know what you got there.
Eight or nine ounces, 22 karat gold.

01:22:35.401 --> 01:22:37.357
Good pearls.

01:22:37.641 --> 01:22:40.997
Play it quiet, maybe
$7,500 on the market.

01:22:41.241 --> 01:22:43.277
Less breakdown and melting costs.

01:22:43.481 --> 01:22:45.472
You wouldn't melt it down,
would you?

01:22:45.681 --> 01:22:47.956
I wouldn't,
but there are those who would.

01:22:48.601 --> 01:22:52.150
The ocean's not a jewelry store.
You don't get no receipts.

01:22:52.401 --> 01:22:53.880
Gotta prove it's authentic.

01:22:54.081 --> 01:22:55.560
Anybody can see it's authentic.

01:22:55.761 --> 01:22:58.798
You don't understand me.
There's a lot of counterfeit.

01:22:59.041 --> 01:23:02.158
It's real gold, it's real gems,
but it's false.

01:23:03.441 --> 01:23:05.796
You have to establish a provenance.

01:23:06.041 --> 01:23:08.839
You gotta find out proof
that it's real.

01:23:09.841 --> 01:23:14.232
If we could find a verifying record or
a description of any piece down there...

01:23:14.641 --> 01:23:17.030
...that makes it all
worth a bloody fortune.

01:23:18.801 --> 01:23:22.316
You wanna have your name on a plaque?
You wanna be a celebrity?

01:23:23.441 --> 01:23:26.160
No, there's not enough room
in the Hamilton Library.

01:23:26.361 --> 01:23:29.273
I think they could find
a bit of room for you, boy.

01:23:29.521 --> 01:23:33.594
Well, it's just possible
there's something else going on...

01:23:33.841 --> 01:23:36.355
...but I don't know what it is.

01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:44.197
You can beat it out of me,
but it won't do you any good.

01:23:44.401 --> 01:23:46.596
I merely need information.

01:23:49.641 --> 01:23:52.951
Which brings us, of course,
to your fee.

01:23:54.201 --> 01:23:56.351
How much is Treece paying you,
by the way?

01:23:59.241 --> 01:24:00.959
I'll pay 10 percent.

01:24:05.561 --> 01:24:06.755
Done.

01:24:14.001 --> 01:24:15.400
How many did they get today?

01:24:17.561 --> 01:24:18.755
Six...

01:24:19.201 --> 01:24:21.351
Four thousand or so.

01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:23.950
And yet Treece claims
they're all down there?

01:24:24.201 --> 01:24:26.635
That's what the girl says, yes.

01:24:28.601 --> 01:24:32.958
It almost seems as if Treece
is hiding something from both of us.

01:24:34.241 --> 01:24:35.754
Doesn't it, my friend?

01:24:41.841 --> 01:24:45.356
And we can't have partners
that double-cross us, can we?

01:24:48.721 --> 01:24:49.915
David?

01:24:51.321 --> 01:24:53.357
You know, maybe you were right.

01:24:55.721 --> 01:24:58.952
I think somebody was lying.
Do you know who I think it is?

01:24:59.721 --> 01:25:01.359
The governor of Havana.

01:25:02.041 --> 01:25:03.952
Come here, have a look at this.

01:25:07.201 --> 01:25:11.991
This is the list he sent back to Spain,
reporting the goods lost in the storm.

01:25:12.241 --> 01:25:14.152
But according to this list...

01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:18.155
...more was lost than the fleet's
sailing manifest said was sent.

01:25:19.641 --> 01:25:22.951
You know the difference?
The difference is jewels.

01:25:23.161 --> 01:25:26.949
Not trinkets, mind you.
Masterpieces. Works of art.

01:25:28.201 --> 01:25:32.558
Two pages were lost. They never got to
Seville. That's where the original is.

01:25:34.121 --> 01:25:35.554
You listen.

01:25:36.801 --> 01:25:39.679
" A team of silver horses
pulling a golden carriage.

01:25:40.921 --> 01:25:43.913
A pair of jade hummingbirds,
one with wings of emeralds...

01:25:44.121 --> 01:25:48.672
...the other with wings of pearls.
A golden dragon with emerald eyes."

01:25:48.921 --> 01:25:51.151
Does it say anything
about what we found?

01:25:51.361 --> 01:25:55.559
Like the pine cone filled with pearls?
Or the medallion itself?

01:25:55.761 --> 01:25:58.150
No, not on that page.

01:25:58.841 --> 01:26:02.993
You know something? This doesn't
even look like a proper manifest to me.

01:26:03.441 --> 01:26:05.636
It's not a manifest.
It's a shopping list.

01:26:05.921 --> 01:26:07.877
- For a woman.
- For what?

01:26:08.361 --> 01:26:10.556
It's a shopping list for a woman.

01:26:11.161 --> 01:26:13.550
Gentlemen, I give you "E.F."I

01:26:17.361 --> 01:26:19.750
- The lady on the medallion.
- The Duchess of Parma.

01:26:20.001 --> 01:26:23.277
Come on, Gail.
We've got an "E.F.", not a "D.P."

01:26:23.521 --> 01:26:27.070
The Duchess of Parma was her title.
Elisabeth Farnese was her name.

01:26:27.601 --> 01:26:28.590
Get on with it.

01:26:28.841 --> 01:26:33.596
It seems that in 1 71 4, when King
Philip's first wife had just died...

01:26:33.841 --> 01:26:38.596
...he developed a royal lust
for the beautiful Duchess of Parma.

01:26:38.801 --> 01:26:43.352
She finally agreed to marry him
by proxy. But he wasn't there yet.

01:26:43.561 --> 01:26:46.553
She wasn't a woman who gave
away something for nothing...

01:26:46.761 --> 01:26:47.876
...like her virginity.

01:26:48.601 --> 01:26:52.992
Before he could touch that, she insisted
that he deck her up with jewels...

01:26:53.201 --> 01:26:56.955
...quote, "Unique in all the world,"
unquote.

01:26:57.201 --> 01:26:59.590
Philip commissioned
those jewels to be made.

01:26:59.841 --> 01:27:02.719
And if that's what we found,
he never got laid.

01:27:03.641 --> 01:27:05.438
Beautiful! Just beautiful!

01:27:06.041 --> 01:27:08.350
Yeah, she was a pretty smart lady.

01:27:08.561 --> 01:27:13.476
In three years, all he's ever given me
is a sweater and a pair of sneakers.

01:27:15.841 --> 01:27:18.560
Well, he isn't the king of Spain,
is he, girl?

01:27:18.841 --> 01:27:20.035
What do you think?

01:27:22.441 --> 01:27:23.635
Well...

01:27:25.601 --> 01:27:27.353
Thinking aloud...

01:27:28.001 --> 01:27:31.676
...suppose you were the governor
of Havana, with a three-lock box...

01:27:31.921 --> 01:27:36.756
...and you knew it had something
so valuable, belonging to the king...

01:27:38.401 --> 01:27:42.189
...you might not put it
on a prime target like a flagship.

01:27:42.441 --> 01:27:44.591
You might put it on a tobacco ship.

01:27:45.281 --> 01:27:46.999
The fleet was there
for protection...

01:27:47.241 --> 01:27:50.790
...but the whole fleet sank,
except the French tobacco ship.

01:27:51.241 --> 01:27:53.357
And the governor keeps to his story...

01:27:53.561 --> 01:27:56.792
...and he lists the box
as lost along with the fleet.

01:27:57.241 --> 01:27:58.469
I'll buy it.

01:27:58.681 --> 01:28:03.197
The Grifon sails again into
another hurricane off Bermuda...

01:28:03.401 --> 01:28:04.277
...and it sinks.

01:28:04.481 --> 01:28:09.396
The poor old governor has to go back to
Madrid and live on his pension, right?

01:28:12.241 --> 01:28:16.029
You know, girl, if we could
just find one item down there...

01:28:16.241 --> 01:28:18.960
...just one that's
on your shopping list...

01:28:19.161 --> 01:28:21.550
...we've found our bloody provenance!

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:36.154
That's why he wouldn't let me dive.

01:29:38.761 --> 01:29:40.752
Damn you, Treece.

01:30:27.921 --> 01:30:30.355
"E.F."I
It's "E.F." again!

01:30:30.601 --> 01:30:32.159
Treece! Treece!

01:32:31.521 --> 01:32:33.671
Up! Up! Everybody up!

01:32:39.321 --> 01:32:40.993
The both of you! Move!

01:32:41.241 --> 01:32:42.390
Let me get this first.

01:32:42.641 --> 01:32:43.835
Get up!

01:32:44.401 --> 01:32:47.438
- Let me get this first!
- I don't care what you found, boy!

01:33:23.241 --> 01:33:25.550
Gail, get the dredge!

01:34:45.561 --> 01:34:49.554
Our only chance is
to go up with the bubbles.

01:34:49.801 --> 01:34:54.352
Take all the breath you can. I'm
cutting the air hoses, so stay calm.

01:35:41.041 --> 01:35:43.350
What the hell happened up here?

01:35:43.561 --> 01:35:46.758
Old Fellini came by in his boat.
He was all rummed up.

01:35:46.961 --> 01:35:51.796
I must have been dozing. When I looked
out, all that stuff in the water...

01:35:52.001 --> 01:35:53.514
Sharks were everywhere!

01:35:53.721 --> 01:35:55.473
Why not warn us
on the compressor?

01:35:55.681 --> 01:35:57.478
I was going to turn it on!

01:35:57.801 --> 01:36:01.157
But then I knew you wouldn't know
what kind of trouble you was in.

01:36:01.401 --> 01:36:04.677
And I might send you up right into them.

01:36:04.921 --> 01:36:07.151
Thank God, you came through.

01:36:16.001 --> 01:36:18.913
I knew there was more
than morphine down there.

01:36:20.041 --> 01:36:23.590
All those ampoules coming up
so slow like they were.

01:36:23.801 --> 01:36:25.951
Yes, that's right, Adam.

01:36:26.201 --> 01:36:29.352
I might have saved your life
for something after all.

01:36:30.241 --> 01:36:31.356
Hey, boy!

01:36:31.561 --> 01:36:36.191
There'll be no more diving today,
not with all those sharks flying around.

01:36:40.201 --> 01:36:43.398
All right, once again.
Just for the hell of it, all right?

01:36:43.641 --> 01:36:45.757
I'm too tired.

01:36:46.121 --> 01:36:49.397
Let's face it,
we haven't got our provenance.

01:36:49.601 --> 01:36:52.115
The jewelry we saw must be
on those missing pages.

01:36:52.321 --> 01:36:55.677
Let's go over it again,
just for the hell of it. All right?

01:36:55.921 --> 01:36:58.355
All right.
Give me a rum, would you?

01:36:59.961 --> 01:37:02.600
One gold and ruby-studded cross...

01:37:16.961 --> 01:37:18.155
Good morning.

01:37:31.361 --> 01:37:32.555
Kevin?

01:37:51.121 --> 01:37:53.351
Four tanks. They need filling.

01:37:53.841 --> 01:37:56.355
Treece is expecting me.
They all up there?

01:37:56.561 --> 01:37:57.960
Aye, they're there.

01:39:55.041 --> 01:39:58.158
Gail, let me see
your sketch of the Grifon.

01:39:58.761 --> 01:40:00.160
It's in my bag.

01:40:03.441 --> 01:40:06.558
- Is there any fresh coffee?
- Yeah, it's on the table.

01:40:08.561 --> 01:40:12.156
This is the medallion.
I want the original one. The Goliath.

01:40:12.721 --> 01:40:14.951
- It's in there too.
- No, it's not in here.

01:40:15.161 --> 01:40:17.356
- It must be.
- Well, you come look.

01:40:26.761 --> 01:40:28.353
You're right, it's not.

01:40:30.241 --> 01:40:31.560
Adam...

01:40:33.241 --> 01:40:35.755
...I think I'll take a breath of air.

01:40:37.001 --> 01:40:39.754
Do you mind locking up after me?

01:40:49.521 --> 01:40:50.715
Thank you.

01:41:44.921 --> 01:41:46.798
Jesus, that's it. That is it!

01:41:47.041 --> 01:41:48.872
- What?
- I've seen this.

01:41:49.081 --> 01:41:51.595
I mean, I've seen
part of this down there.

01:41:51.801 --> 01:41:53.598
You've seen what?

01:41:53.841 --> 01:41:58.756
She's wearing a dragon pendant, but
when you drew these lines right here...

01:41:59.001 --> 01:42:02.073
...I thought that was part of her dress.

01:42:02.281 --> 01:42:05.114
I've seen this chain.
I've seen this chain down there.

01:42:05.321 --> 01:42:07.391
I was trying to get it
when the sharks came.

01:42:07.601 --> 01:42:11.958
On the list, there's something
about gold chains. Chains of gold.

01:42:19.681 --> 01:42:20.909
There's nothing here.

01:42:21.121 --> 01:42:22.839
Yes. Yes, there is.

01:42:24.161 --> 01:42:25.435
There is a dragon pendant.

01:42:25.641 --> 01:42:27.950
- A gold dragon with emerald eyes.
- That's it!

01:42:28.161 --> 01:42:31.392
The jeweler that made this pendant
also made this medallion.

01:42:31.681 --> 01:42:35.674
If I go there and I find the chain, and
the dragon's at the end of the chain...

01:42:36.641 --> 01:42:40.156
...then we got our proof, babe.
We've got our proof!

01:42:46.321 --> 01:42:47.515
Kev?

01:43:52.161 --> 01:43:55.119
Treece, we solved it!
It was here all along.

01:43:55.361 --> 01:43:58.319
It's the provenance!
David's seen part of it down there.

01:43:58.521 --> 01:43:59.920
You've solved nothing.

01:44:00.121 --> 01:44:01.520
What are you talking about?

01:44:01.721 --> 01:44:04.110
I'm gonna blow the Goliath now.

01:44:04.681 --> 01:44:05.636
Why now?

01:44:08.081 --> 01:44:12.996
Because if anything happens to me,
there's nobody else left to do it.

01:44:21.561 --> 01:44:24.121
What do you mean,
if anything happens to you?

01:44:28.961 --> 01:44:32.237
All right, you go ahead
and blow the Goliath.

01:44:32.481 --> 01:44:34.631
But first I'm getting that provenance.

01:44:37.601 --> 01:44:40.399
Go upstairs, pack and go home.

01:44:40.601 --> 01:44:43.752
To hell with it, Treece.
I'm not doing that!

01:44:44.001 --> 01:44:47.835
I'm going down there. And you're
gonna have to blow me up tool

01:44:49.561 --> 01:44:51.517
As you please, boy.

01:44:53.401 --> 01:44:54.720
Excuse me.

01:45:01.401 --> 01:45:03.551
You don't need me down there, do you?

01:45:03.801 --> 01:45:05.917
No, I don't think I do.

01:46:10.001 --> 01:46:11.195
Coffin...?

01:46:12.321 --> 01:46:14.118
They killed Kevin.

01:46:34.001 --> 01:46:36.754
I'm gonna signal you
when I fire this fuse.

01:46:37.001 --> 01:46:39.993
After that, I don't care
if you've found the Holy Grail.

01:46:40.161 --> 01:46:41.674
You've got three minutes...

01:46:42.201 --> 01:46:43.520
...so get out!

01:46:50.321 --> 01:46:54.997
Don't worry. Just turn on the
air dredge when I get in, all right?

01:46:55.321 --> 01:46:56.913
I'll be all right.

01:56:42.601 --> 01:56:44.717
David! Treece?

01:57:36.201 --> 01:57:38.317
David! Here!
