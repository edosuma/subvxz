WEBVTT

00:03.737 --> 00:05.739
Ms. Lemon...

00:05.739 --> 00:07.007
here's the research you wanted
for that White House skit.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.708
Oh. Okay, thanks.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.642
You know it, Lady "Broseph!"

00:12.445 --> 00:14.514
What?!

00:14.514 --> 00:15.715
Those are your new interns.

00:15.715 --> 00:17.050
Aren't they a little
old and overdressed?

00:17.050 --> 00:20.153
They're all former
investment bankers who were

00:20.153 --> 00:21.287
laid off in that economic crash

00:21.287 --> 00:23.356
that Nancy Pelosi caused.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.258
They've got zero real world skills

00:25.258 --> 00:26.559
but, God, they work hard.

00:28.495 --> 00:29.696
Gentlemen...

00:29.696 --> 00:32.198
I need you to run out
and pick up some flowers

00:32.198 --> 00:33.900
a collection of bath soaps

00:33.900 --> 00:35.390
and some Spanish-language
gossip magazines.

00:36.736 --> 00:39.272
Soap and Spanish magazines?

00:39.272 --> 00:42.909
What, are you expecting
a visit from the, um... uh...

00:42.909 --> 00:44.644
Oh, Lemon, don't start it unless
you've got something.

00:44.644 --> 00:45.879
Okay.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.580
Elisa's grandmother is coming to visit.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.049
I don't think she likes me.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.784
<i>Te odio</i>.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.085
<i>Yo soy</i> Jack.

00:52.085 --> 00:53.620
I don't understand it.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.954
Well, as long as Elisa likes you

00:54.954 --> 00:56.222
that's all that matters, right?

00:56.222 --> 00:58.091
Oh, no. I need Concepcion onboard.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.626
She's the matriarch of this family.

00:59.626 --> 01:00.894
And in Puerto Rico

01:00.894 --> 01:02.862
elderly women are held
in very high esteem.

01:02.862 --> 01:05.165
You should go there, Lemon.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.190
They'd love you.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.805
None of this is mine.
I live in 3B. This is 13B.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.940
You know what?
I'm going to say it.

01:13.940 --> 01:16.309
Women should not deliver the mail.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.244
Dr. Andrew Baird?
Do you know this guy?

01:18.244 --> 01:19.579
I don't think so.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.948
Well, he's a pediatrician,
so you know he likes kids.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.283
Or feet?
No, no, kids.

01:23.283 --> 01:26.786
He has a bill from a divorce
lawyer, so you know he's single.

01:26.786 --> 01:29.689
And he has a golf magazine, so
you know he's not gay or poor.

01:29.689 --> 01:31.191
Jenna, come on.

01:31.191 --> 01:32.625
Now, let's see what kind
of movies he likes.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.094
What are you doing?

01:34.094 --> 01:36.129
That's a Federal offense, and
you already have two strikes!

01:36.129 --> 01:37.263
Shh!

01:37.263 --> 01:39.432
Yeah, I do not \support this!

01:39.432 --> 01:41.601
"Muppets Take Manhattan."
"Caddyshack."

01:41.601 --> 01:43.603
Hmm.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.305
And a documentary about
how pies are made.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.507
Hello, Dr. Baird.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.909
Wasn't that a treat?

01:49.909 --> 01:53.146
Only the special tours get
to see Conan without his wig.

01:56.349 --> 01:57.383
Oh, I'm sorry...

01:57.383 --> 01:59.018
but her show is on now.

01:59.018 --> 02:00.553
Do you think we could...

02:00.553 --> 02:02.388
Uh, yes, yes.

02:02.388 --> 02:06.159
Jonathan, would you come
and help Mrs. Padriera?

02:06.159 --> 02:07.193
I think your grandmother hates me.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.728
I don't understand it.

02:08.728 --> 02:11.331
She's usually a very loving person.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.966
Is it because I'm white?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.868
No, I've had white boyfriends.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.569
Black, Cuban...

02:16.569 --> 02:19.139
Brazilian guys with German heritage...

02:19.139 --> 02:21.641
I get it. You've been with
other men. Congratulations.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.675
Oh, thank you.

02:22.675 --> 02:24.210
What is she watching?

02:24.210 --> 02:26.012
<i>"Los Amantes Clandestinos."</i>

02:26.012 --> 02:27.580
It's a Mexican telenovela.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.082
But who is that?

02:29.082 --> 02:30.850
That is <i>El Generalissimo</i>.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.485
He is the villain of <i>Los Amantes</i>.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.720
<i>Papa!</i>

02:33.720 --> 02:35.588
The name of the actor
is Hector Moreda.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.588
He looks exactly like me.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.565
He does look like you.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:22.101 --> 03:24.170
Oh, dude! I have to meet you.
I'm Brian.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.572
What's up, Brian?

03:25.572 --> 03:27.173
We love you.

03:27.173 --> 03:30.043
"This honky grandma be trippin'!"

03:30.043 --> 03:31.277
Hey, when I quote lines
from your movies

03:31.277 --> 03:32.378
that's not racist, right?

03:32.378 --> 03:35.114
Of course not, I transcend race.

03:35.114 --> 03:36.382
Look, we're all going out after work

03:36.382 --> 03:37.750
and I know you like to party.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.586
We'd be honored if you'd come with.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.188
You shouldn't end a sentence
with a preposition at.

03:42.188 --> 03:43.223
But, yeah...

03:43.223 --> 03:44.324
I'm in.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.827
Oh, we'll start off
at McManus-McMinnigan's.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.696
Have you ever drunk a yard of beer?

03:49.696 --> 03:53.257
A yard like a lawn?
Yes, I have.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.926
Tracy Jordan!

04:02.242 --> 04:03.876
He has an ice cream maker?

04:03.876 --> 04:05.578
Come on!

04:05.578 --> 04:07.180
Don't be weird looking.
Don't be weird looking.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.148
Ah! A girl!

04:09.148 --> 04:10.850
Oh, God.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.408
Dr. Baird, there's someone at
your door.

04:13.386 --> 04:16.154
Oh. Thanks, Oswald.

04:16.154 --> 04:18.558
Oswald was just helping me
hang some pictures.

04:18.558 --> 04:21.194
I live in the basement,
so I have all the nails.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.929
I'm Drew.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.365
Sorry I smell like frosting.

04:25.365 --> 04:27.162
I just... love to bake.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.440
I want to go to there.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.309
So will I see you before Saturday?

04:36.309 --> 04:38.211
<i>Jack, about</i>
<i>this weekend</i>...

04:38.211 --> 04:40.246
I don't think you should
come to my cousin's

04:40.246 --> 04:41.881
police academy graduation...

04:41.881 --> 04:43.883
<i>or my other cousin's parole party</i>.

04:43.883 --> 04:46.753
Boy, I hope those two don't
eventually have a showdown

04:46.753 --> 04:49.088
that pits family against justice.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.791
Uh, hang on. You mean you
don't want me to come?

04:51.791 --> 04:54.093
It's not me. Abuela thought it
should just be family.

04:54.093 --> 04:56.462
Is this about the <i>Generalissimo?</i>

04:56.462 --> 04:58.765
Jack, as a child my grandmother
worked in a silver mine

04:58.765 --> 05:00.767
without proper ventilation.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.603
Now, her mind is squishy like a hacky sack.

05:03.603 --> 05:06.572
<i>But no matter what,</i>
<i>she is still my abuelita</i>

05:06.572 --> 05:08.007
even though, sometimes,
she comes at me

05:08.007 --> 05:09.942
with a knife because of a silver frenzy.

05:09.942 --> 05:11.944
<i>I'll call you tomorrow, okay?</i>

05:11.944 --> 05:13.377
Okay. Good night, <i>querida</i>.

05:17.550 --> 05:22.121
<i>Generalissimo</i>.

05:22.121 --> 05:24.891
Look at Dr. Baird.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.726
Mmm, how did you get
a picture of him?

05:26.726 --> 05:29.028
I told him his haircut was
exactly what I've been trying

05:29.028 --> 05:31.097
to describe to my barber.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.399
Yeah, smooth, I know.
I'm way out of my league here.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.934
Okay, don't get intimidated.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.336
You know he can't be perfect.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.470
No, he might be.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.305
I got some more of his mail...

05:39.305 --> 05:40.740
and I opened it.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.142
Uh-huh, yeah. I'm the worst.

05:43.142 --> 05:44.577
It just proves that I don't
deserve this guy.

05:44.577 --> 05:46.479
He went to medical
school at Columbia...

05:46.479 --> 05:48.414
all kinds of charity baloney.

05:48.414 --> 05:50.249
He gets all of the movie
channels, including Starz.

05:50.249 --> 05:54.487
And... he trains seeing eye dogs at home.

05:54.487 --> 05:56.489
Oh, well, that's no good for you.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.690
You're allergic to dogs.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.025
I guess I'll have to step in and...

05:59.025 --> 06:00.460
Shut up! Just let me think!

06:00.460 --> 06:01.761
Shh!

06:01.761 --> 06:02.929
Please keep your voices down.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.022
Mr. Jordan is a little hung over.

06:06.265 --> 06:08.301
He pulled an "Uncle Harland
Parcell" last night

06:08.301 --> 06:09.969
minus the wistful jug-blowing.

06:09.969 --> 06:11.537
I went out with the interns.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.028
Those white boys are not kidding around.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.276
Have you ever tasted Scotch?
It's terrible!

06:17.276 --> 06:18.678
And this thing they call

06:18.678 --> 06:22.014
"box seats at the Rangers game"?
It's so cold!

06:22.014 --> 06:23.549
And what is Rohypnol?

06:23.549 --> 06:25.551
Tracy, those are roofies!

06:25.551 --> 06:27.553
So, I shouldn't have taken two
of them for my headache?

06:27.553 --> 06:28.654
There he is!

06:28.654 --> 06:31.557
Tonight, shooters at Blockheads,
lay a base

06:31.557 --> 06:33.192
and meet up with my "bro-hams"
at the Cornell Club?

06:33.192 --> 06:34.694
Hey, you know it, Bri-man!

06:34.694 --> 06:35.862
Hey!

06:35.862 --> 06:39.365
I have no idea what either one
of us just said.

06:39.365 --> 06:40.633
Well, he thinks you're going out again.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.235
You've gotta tell him you can't.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.669
I have a rep to maintain.

06:43.669 --> 06:46.739
If I can't keep up with a bunch
of Wall Street frat boys...

06:46.739 --> 06:49.299
Uh-oh... here come the roofies.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.940
You can do whatever you want to me.

06:55.715 --> 06:59.752
<i>Uno</i>... <i>dos</i>...

07:01.654 --> 07:03.356
You wanted to see me?

07:03.356 --> 07:04.757
Oh, Lemon, this is Elisa.

07:04.757 --> 07:05.758
What? Come on.

07:05.758 --> 07:06.759
You're a nurse?

07:06.759 --> 07:08.227
Yes, some of us are hot.

07:08.227 --> 07:09.529
Lemon, we have a problem...

07:09.529 --> 07:10.496
with him.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.370
Boy, That guy looks a lot like you.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.704
Precisely.

07:18.704 --> 07:21.007
Two hours a day, five days
a week, Hector Moreda

07:21.007 --> 07:22.208
and the <i>Generalissimo</i>

07:22.208 --> 07:24.710
are poisoning Elisa's
grandmother against me.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.913
Oh! He just blew up that kid!

07:26.913 --> 07:28.581
Elisa and I have enough obstacles...

07:28.581 --> 07:31.117
our work schedules, our cultures...

07:31.117 --> 07:32.552
her adorably broken English.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.420
Metro cards are a real thing, Jack.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.389
You use them on the subway.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.192
Anyway, this morning,
Telemundo, which is owned by

07:39.192 --> 07:40.960
Sheinhardt-Universal

07:40.960 --> 07:42.795
purchased <i>Los Amantes</i>, uh...

07:42.795 --> 07:44.163
<i>Clandestinos</i>.

07:44.163 --> 07:46.098
And now... I own it.

07:46.098 --> 07:47.133
Isn't that romantic?

07:47.133 --> 07:48.568
Now, all I have to do

07:48.568 --> 07:51.337
is kill off the <i>Generalissimo</i>
and clear a path

07:51.337 --> 07:52.772
to Elisa's <i>abuela</i>.

07:52.772 --> 07:54.574
Lemon, the director needs
a script by this afternoon

07:54.574 --> 07:56.476
and Elisa here will
help you with the Spanish.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.977
No, no, no, don't drag me into this.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.446
I have my own problems and I've
never even watched that show.

08:00.446 --> 08:04.050
All you need to know is that
<i>El Generalissimo</i> is pure evil.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.318
Look at him.

08:05.318 --> 08:09.222
He stole that girl's love
letters and opened them.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.523
Opened her mail?

08:10.523 --> 08:12.391
That is just... shocking.

08:12.391 --> 08:15.194
He's a monster... or he has a
really good reason to do it.

08:15.194 --> 08:18.231
Oh, no, his only reason
was to trick her

08:18.231 --> 08:20.967
into giving up her honor to him.

08:20.967 --> 08:24.670
Uh-huh, and how did he use her
mail to do that, exactly?

08:24.670 --> 08:27.306
He read her most intimate secrets

08:27.306 --> 08:30.309
and turned himself into that which she desired.

08:30.309 --> 08:33.145
What she loved, he
pretended to love too

08:33.145 --> 08:34.611
until it was too late.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.513
Huh.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.957
My dog ran away!

08:44.957 --> 08:46.692
Oh, my God.
Let me get my coat.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.167
Buster?

08:55.167 --> 08:57.003
Buster! Come here, boy!

08:57.003 --> 08:58.337
Buster!

08:58.337 --> 09:02.933
The funny thing is, this is
what I love about him.

09:04.677 --> 09:08.748
Don't worry, Liz.
We're going to find him.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.683
If we don't

09:10.683 --> 09:12.652
I don't think I could ever be
around dogs again.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.520
Oh.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.055
You know, I'm actually
on the board

09:16.055 --> 09:17.390
of the Pediatric Restless
Leg Syndrome Association.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.360
Oh. I forgot
I even had this on.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.995
I have so many charity t-shirts.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.730
We have so much in common.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.832
Well, Buster's probably dead.

09:26.832 --> 09:28.534
Do you want to go to the wine
bar around the corner

09:28.534 --> 09:30.536
deal with these emotions?
Get some dinner?

09:30.536 --> 09:33.937
Uh... I would love to, Liz.
I really would.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.577
But I just got divorced not that long ago.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.272
I'm really not ready for
this kind of thing just yet.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.949
Plus, I have not given up on that dog.

09:42.949 --> 09:44.317
He's a fighter.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.252
Buster!

09:46.252 --> 09:49.021
Yeah... Buster.

09:49.021 --> 09:50.990
Oh, shoot it, dog!

09:50.990 --> 09:53.559
I'm going to.
I'm Tracy Jordan.

09:53.559 --> 09:57.518
Why would I be afraid of fire
next to my mouth?

10:04.770 --> 10:06.238
Is she watching?

10:06.238 --> 10:08.074
Yes. I told her it was

10:08.074 --> 10:09.974
a very special episode.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.376
Good-bye, General.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.927
Wait, wait.
What did he just say?

10:27.927 --> 10:29.095
That wasn't in the script.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.630
He said, "You missed."

10:33.899 --> 10:35.230
He said, "You missed again."

10:39.271 --> 10:42.441
"And now, this potion is going
to make me live forever"?

10:42.441 --> 10:44.610
What's happening, Jack?

10:44.610 --> 10:46.946
<i>El Generalissimo</i> was supposed to die!

10:49.749 --> 10:51.317
Moreda has gone "Broken Arrow."
Jonathan?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.952
We really should have
had somebody on the set

10:52.952 --> 10:55.421
who speaks Spanish.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.823
<i>I'll call you back</i>.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.318
Moreda.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.529
Moreda!

11:16.275 --> 11:20.579
Welcome, Jack.
Cigar? Brandy?

11:20.579 --> 11:21.881
What happened, Hector?

11:21.881 --> 11:24.817
The General was supposed to die.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.586
Hey... do not try to
out-<i>Generalissimo</i> me, my friend.

11:27.586 --> 11:29.288
This role has made me

11:29.288 --> 11:31.188
rich, famous, and respected.

11:32.291 --> 11:35.194
I get to cut the line at
Disneyland if I come mid-week.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.197
I have a lucrative endorsement
deal with <i>Sabor de Soledad</i>.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.968
I am not going to let you
take all that away from me.

11:42.968 --> 11:44.770
I know where you
came from, Hector.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.273
Play ball, or you'll be back
doing R-rated hypnotism

11:47.273 --> 11:49.475
at the bullfights so fast,
you won't know what hit you.

11:49.475 --> 11:52.478
You come over here
and say that to my face!

11:52.478 --> 11:54.146
No. You come over here.

11:54.146 --> 11:56.282
Nunca! If you refuse to be reasonable

11:56.282 --> 11:58.580
I must call the <i>presidente</i>
of Telemundo!

12:02.555 --> 12:03.889
<i>La oficina de</i> Jack Donaghy.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.658
<i>Hola?</i>

12:05.658 --> 12:06.716
Well played, Jack.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.399
I see that we are not
so different, you and I.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.334
We laugh alike.

12:15.334 --> 12:16.702
We think alike.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.037
At times, we even drink alike.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.706
You could lose your mind.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.845
Look, you should know I'm doing
this for a woman...

12:25.845 --> 12:28.581
this woman.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.349
Wow.

12:30.349 --> 12:32.685
I am super gay, and I would
totally switch for her.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.453
She's amazing.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.255
But her grandmother hates me

12:36.255 --> 12:38.591
because she hates the
<i>Generalissimo</i> so he's got to go.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.860
<i>El Generalissimo</i> does not have to die

12:40.860 --> 12:42.995
to clear the way to the <i>abuela</i>.

12:42.995 --> 12:45.431
Not if the <i>abuela</i> comes to love him.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.199
But... that's impossible.

12:47.199 --> 12:51.135
Seduction is never impossible
for <i>El Generalissimo</i>.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.908
I will become everything that
old Hispanic women desire.

12:55.908 --> 12:58.110
I will make her love me.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.179
You really think you can pull that off?

13:00.179 --> 13:01.914
It will be the performance
of a lifetime

13:01.914 --> 13:05.351
like Julie Harris in <i>The Belle of Amherst</i>.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.453
Wow. You are surprisingly gay.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.789
Okay. So...

13:09.789 --> 13:11.624
So, did you ever find Buster?

13:11.624 --> 13:12.725
What did you not understand?

13:12.725 --> 13:14.627
That picture is from a dog food ad.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.961
Hi.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.963
Hi, Lemon.
Here's today's script.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.565
I translated it

13:19.565 --> 13:20.998
and took out the <i>Star Wars</i> references.

13:22.101 --> 13:23.102
Are you an actress?

13:23.102 --> 13:24.470
No, I'm a nurse.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.038
Oh, good.

13:26.038 --> 13:28.407
Don't listen to anyone who says
you should become an actress.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.775
Okay.

13:29.775 --> 13:33.312
Uh, I also cut the scene between
the General and T <i>'</i> la Maria.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.613
They cannot be together.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.582
Not after what he did to Maria's daughter.

13:36.582 --> 13:37.817
Why? What did he do?

13:37.817 --> 13:39.885
Oh, it was despicable

13:39.885 --> 13:42.721
even worse than his misuse of the mails.

13:42.721 --> 13:45.491
The <i>Generalissimo</i>
tricked her to the villa

13:45.491 --> 13:47.059
by inviting her to a fancy party.

13:47.059 --> 13:51.897
But when she got there,
it was just the two of them.

13:51.897 --> 13:55.301
He drugged her champagne
and had his way with her.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.002
Later, she gave birth to the Devil.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.470
You know... sweeps week.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.840
That's what I could do to Drew.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.107
Drug him? Liz, no.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.243
Having been on both sides of
that, I can tell you

14:04.243 --> 14:05.444
it's not a good idea.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.913
No, I'm going to tell Drew that I'm having

14:07.913 --> 14:09.582
a little "Welcome to the
Building" party for him.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.550
But there is no party.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.185
And then, when he shows up

14:13.185 --> 14:15.855
I'll laugh and say, "Oh, it's the wrong night."

14:15.855 --> 14:17.356
And then, he'll laugh and say,

14:17.356 --> 14:18.557
"Oh, well, one glass couldn't hurt."

14:18.557 --> 14:20.459
And then, I will put
my mouth on his mouth.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.094
No, Lemon. Do not do this.

14:22.094 --> 14:24.563
The trickery, the deceit...
it's a slippery slope.

14:24.563 --> 14:26.232
Yeah, but you haven't seen Dr. Baird.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.100
He looks like a cartoon pilot.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.369
Be very careful.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.471
<i>El Generalissimo</i> was once a good man.

14:32.471 --> 14:35.140
But the years of loneliness
drove him insane.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.938
I am not the <i>Generalissimo</i>, Elisa.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.650
Mr. Jordan, I called my Uncle Harland

14:44.650 --> 14:46.318
and I got his hangover cure.

14:46.318 --> 14:50.122
Mix two cups boiled possum meat
with one mess-load ragweed.

14:50.122 --> 14:51.991
Stir in alcohol...

14:51.991 --> 14:53.592
Ken, these interns are wearing me out.

14:53.592 --> 14:54.727
It's like I said

14:54.727 --> 14:56.128
in my not-hit comedy

14:56.128 --> 15:00.666
"Cruise Boat," "I'm getting
too old for this ship."

15:00.666 --> 15:02.268
Well, you are getting older, sir.

15:02.268 --> 15:04.003
There's no reason you have
to keep acting like you're <i>20</i>.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.704
Yes, there is.

15:05.704 --> 15:08.540
Do you know what happens to
a comedian when he gets old

15:08.540 --> 15:10.209
and loses his audience?

15:10.209 --> 15:12.711
He starts to get offered serious roles.

15:12.711 --> 15:15.581
And do you really want
to see me play Arthur Ashe?

15:15.581 --> 15:19.685
No... that would be terrible.
You leave him alone.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.922
Exactly. So if I'm going to keep
my hilarious reputation

15:22.922 --> 15:25.557
these interns got to go.

15:25.557 --> 15:27.559
But where? They don't know
how to do anything.

15:27.559 --> 15:29.161
And there are no jobs left on Wall Street.

15:29.161 --> 15:30.856
Then I'll find them something
for them to do.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.101
Drew!

15:36.101 --> 15:38.671
Oh, uh... am I the first one here?

15:38.671 --> 15:41.573
What? Oh...

15:41.573 --> 15:43.275
No, the party is tomorrow night.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.710
Tonight, I'm just hanging out

15:44.710 --> 15:46.912
eating fondue by candlelight.

15:46.912 --> 15:48.580
But come in.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.282
I was just opening a bottle of
wine to drink alone.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.751
Okay, I guess one glass couldn't hurt.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.486
I found your dog!

15:54.486 --> 15:55.888
What?

15:55.888 --> 15:58.624
He lost his collar, but I
recognized him from the poster.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.626
That's not possible.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.927
Of course it's possible.

16:01.927 --> 16:04.196
How could he not want to come
back to this beautiful lady?

16:04.196 --> 16:06.565
My dog is back!

16:06.565 --> 16:07.733
I'll open the wine.

16:09.702 --> 16:10.691
Just put him down.

17:04.123 --> 17:05.924
Uh... you need more.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.686
Buster, you wang!

17:34.686 --> 17:37.189
Let's get you back in your
special kitchen cabinet.

17:37.189 --> 17:40.159
Man, that dog is giving me a headache.

17:40.159 --> 17:42.593
Well, I have some aspirin in my
white bag there if you need any.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.803
Everything okay in there?

17:50.803 --> 17:55.001
We're just playing a little...
ow! ...game where he bites me.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.635
Alone, at last.

18:02.314 --> 18:03.715
Are you okay?

18:03.715 --> 18:05.649
Yeah. I'm, uh...

18:10.989 --> 18:12.257
You've been roofied!

18:12.257 --> 18:15.194
You did what?

18:15.194 --> 18:16.395
No, no, not me! The pills!

18:16.395 --> 18:18.263
Is this my mail?

18:18.263 --> 18:20.032
Okay. No, you're not thinking clearly.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.500
Why is it all open?

18:24.570 --> 18:26.071
That's not your dog.

18:26.071 --> 18:28.006
I can explain. Just relax!

18:28.006 --> 18:29.132
Help!

18:30.876 --> 18:32.845
I am the <i>Generalissimo</i>.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.143
I don't know what that means.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.715
<i>Abuela</i> made you breaded calf's brains.

18:40.719 --> 18:41.887
<i>Muchas gracias</i>.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.557
She really likes the changes

18:45.557 --> 18:47.525
you've made on <i>Los Amantes Clandestinos</i>.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.766
She's very proud that I am dating

18:54.766 --> 18:56.201
such an important television man.

18:56.201 --> 18:57.532
Oh, well...

18:59.771 --> 19:02.508
What are you going to do
about the NBC news?

19:02.508 --> 19:03.998
It's too sad.

19:05.644 --> 19:09.341
Uh, I'll look into it, uh, <i>abuela</i>.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.254
Hi, Liz.

19:15.254 --> 19:18.790
Oh, hey. Again, I am
so sorry about everything.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.526
I actually got some of your mail.

19:20.526 --> 19:23.629
Oh, okay. Hope you didn't
open it.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.998
I did. <i>Monty Python Live</i>
<i>at the Hollywood Bowl</i>.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.933
Classic.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.735
Membership in the
cheese-of-the-month club

19:29.735 --> 19:31.603
and the steak-of- the-month club

19:31.603 --> 19:33.172
and a copy of <i>Vegetarian Times</i>.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.641
I'm a flip-flopper.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.543
Also, a response to your
complaint about bad grammar

19:37.543 --> 19:38.777
in subway ads.

19:38.777 --> 19:40.946
The word "whom" deserves a defender.

19:40.946 --> 19:44.650
I'm just saying that based on your mail

19:44.650 --> 19:46.118
I actually would
have wanted to meet

19:46.118 --> 19:47.686
this Elizabeth Lemon in 3B.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.948
Really?

19:50.422 --> 19:52.558
Do you want to try this again?

19:52.558 --> 19:55.561
I know that I lied to you and
I accidentally roofied you

19:55.561 --> 19:56.995
but weirder things have
happened, right?

19:56.995 --> 20:00.866
Isn't that Tracy Jordan?

20:00.866 --> 20:02.834
<i>The Lehman Brothers investment</i>
<i>bank will reopen</i>

20:02.834 --> 20:04.536
<i>under the direction</i>

20:04.536 --> 20:05.837

20:11.176 --> 20:13.278
<i>This interview is over</i>.

20:13.278 --> 20:14.947
Yeah, I guess weirder
things have happened.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.481
<i>And now, to lighten things up</i>
