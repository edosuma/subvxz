Man's voice:
<i>Now, pay attention,</i>

00:37.705 --> 00:42.307
<i>'cause I'm about to tell you
the secret to life.</i>

00:42.309 --> 00:44.043
<i>You ready?</i>

00:44.045 --> 00:49.581
<i>The whole damn thing

00:49.583 --> 00:53.052
<i>little, seemingly
insignificant decisions</i>

00:53.054 --> 00:57.756
<i>that clear the road for monster
truck life-altering ones.</i>

<i>You see, every path you take
leads to another choice,</i>

01:03.297 --> 01:07.066

can change everything.</i>

01:07.068 --> 01:12.438
<i>Every damn moment of the rest

01:20.714 --> 01:22.481
Are those
for someone special?

01:22.483 --> 01:26.852
Someone who deserves
the stars and the moon.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.588
All I got
are these damn flowers.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.092
I'm just here
to talk to her.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.860
You go right ahead,
Travis.

If that will help.

They were bred to protect

02:14.568 --> 02:16.702

02:16.704 --> 02:18.303
You are so full of crap.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.872
You kiss your mama

02:19.874 --> 02:21.373
I don't know
how he does it.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.142
What do you mean?
It's his gift.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.576
You know
all about "Star Wars"

02:24.578 --> 02:25.878

We're all dealt a hand.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.780
Them dogs
live in the tundra.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.382
They don't swim
in the water.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.717
You couldn't get
that dog in the water

02:31.719 --> 02:34.553
for an F-150
full of Milk-Bones

02:34.555 --> 02:37.723
driven by Lassie
wearing a two-piece,

02:37.725 --> 02:39.691
even if it's a little
gold one like that.

02:39.693 --> 02:43.162
So you're saying this dog
fights bears and wolves,

02:43.164 --> 02:44.429
<i>but he's afraid
of the water.</i>

02:44.431 --> 02:46.331
I see what you're doing.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.201
You're sassing me,
and that's just 'cause you like me.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.736
That's schoolyard 101.
It happens all the time.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.504
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.439
Need I remind you,
I let you take Marcie Hoffman

02:54.441 --> 02:56.675

02:56.677 --> 02:58.210
<i>- You let me? Ha!
- I let you.</i>

02:58.212 --> 03:00.212
Would you two shut up
and help me down?

03:00.214 --> 03:03.315
Or would you prefer to watch
me slip and crack my skull?

03:03.317 --> 03:05.717
Oh, excuse me.
Look who's sassypants.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.439
You keep that up, there's liable to
be some hair-pulling around here.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.556
Hey, Travis.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.294
Hiya, Monica.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.456
Excuse me, ladies.

03:17.898 --> 03:21.500
You got time to grab a beer
before y'all take off?

03:21.502 --> 03:25.337
Well, I got to get
these knuckleheads home.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.872
Just one quick beer.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.774
It'll be really fast,
I promise.

03:28.776 --> 03:29.875
All right.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.478
Travis: <i>I don't think you and I
have ever had just one.</i>

03:33.480 --> 03:35.240
- Bye, boys.
- Bye, Monica.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.617
She's back.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.652
Just like a boomerang.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.255
Unbelievable.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.496
Don't you start.

03:51.498 --> 03:52.764
Can I just
say one thing?

03:52.766 --> 03:55.000
If that one thing
is "boomerang,"

03:55.002 --> 03:56.368
I'm going to tie
an anchor to your nuts

03:56.370 --> 03:57.650
and throw it overboard.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.942
- Boomerang!

Here come your wives.

Y'all better
start talking.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.589
We were about
to call the Coast Guard.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.560
We got into some mackerel
about three miles out.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.922
They were jumping
in the boat.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.366
- Uh-huh.
- Price tag, bro.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.008
Come on, kids.
Let's go.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.671
Guarantee they've been
at Dockside since noon.

04:32.673 --> 04:33.872
Eh, more fun
to let them think

04:33.874 --> 04:35.374
they're getting
away with something.

and just laugh it up.

I'll just be slaving
away over here

- What do you say we start over?

07:39.159 --> 07:40.892
Uh, why don't
you have a seat...

07:40.894 --> 07:43.161
I do not want a seat,
thank you.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.763
- Would you like a beer?
- I'm fine.

07:44.765 --> 07:45.931
Come on, have a beer.
We got, uh...

07:45.933 --> 07:47.699
I do not want that.
Thank you.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.901
All right.
Well, I'm Travis.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.704
And the rug there,
that's Moby.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.706
- Yeah.
- <i>And, um...</i>

07:56.777 --> 07:58.176
I think this is the point
in the conversation

07:58.178 --> 08:00.612
where you tell me
your name.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.147
Oh, you do, do you?

08:02.149 --> 08:03.815
Well, no.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.617
Okay.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.752
Uh, all right.

08:07.754 --> 08:10.155
Fine. Um...

08:10.157 --> 08:11.890
you know,
there's a certain type of woman

08:11.892 --> 08:15.560
that usually shows up
here after 10:00.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.028
<i>She's wearing ratty sweatpants,
no makeup,</i>

08:17.030 --> 08:20.165
and she's usually
only after one thing.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.501
Oh, my God.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.703
Are you implying
I'm here for sex?

08:24.705 --> 08:27.005
- You are, aren't you?
- Oh, my God.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.507
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.141
Could you be
any more obnoxious?

08:30.143 --> 08:32.910
- Lady, you have no idea.
- Lady! Stop calling me "lady".

08:32.913 --> 08:34.913
- Then tell me your name.
- It is Gabby.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.780
Hello, Gabby.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

08:36.783 --> 08:37.916
What are you so angry about?

08:37.918 --> 08:40.284
I am angry
about Molly's nipples.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.790
Your stinky-ass dog took advantage
of my sweet little girl.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.059
Now her nipples are swollen
and she's gained 15 pounds.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.194
She will not get out of bed,

08:49.196 --> 08:51.530
and you play
your music too loud!

08:54.535 --> 08:58.203
So you're saying that Moby
there knocked up your dog?

08:58.205 --> 09:01.740
Oh, I know Moby there
knocked up my dog.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.141
He wanders
the neighborhood

09:03.143 --> 09:05.143
day and night
unsupervised.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.279
He has been wearing her down

09:07.281 --> 09:08.880
since the moment
that we moved in.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.615
- Wearing her down?
- That's right.

09:10.617 --> 09:11.883
You're responsible.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.618
That's right,
this is my fault.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.620
It's all my fault.
I take full responsibility.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.657
I've talked to him so many
times about using protection.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.858
Don't patronize me.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.259
- Oh, my God, you are...
- I'm sorry.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.794
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:22.796 --> 09:23.995
Look, you're right.
This is serious.

09:23.997 --> 09:28.166
This is serious.
Um, how long do we have?

09:28.168 --> 09:30.168
I mean,
how far along is she?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.170
Oh, God.
This is so funny to you.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.572
It's a little funny, yeah.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.906
Well, I'm not exactly sure,

09:34.908 --> 09:36.708
because I haven't
taken her to the vet yet.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.243
So how do you even know
she's pregnant?

09:38.245 --> 09:41.713
Because I'm a medical student
and I'm also a woman.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.014
The second I knew,
the first one is...

09:43.016 --> 09:44.182
- Oh, you did?
- ...new information.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.283
Oh, you're so smart.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.618
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.653
Well, I like
your confidence.

09:48.655 --> 09:51.923
And there happens to be a fantastic
clinic right here in town.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.658
It's kind of
a father-son thing.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.961
- Okay.
- And I want you to know,

09:55.963 --> 09:58.063
Moby is not going to
be a deadbeat dad.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.664
He's...
this is not going to be

09:59.666 --> 10:01.800
one of them "Dirty Dancing"
type situations.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.935
- Okay.
- He's going to stand up straight like a man.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.138
Hey. Somebody say
"Dirty Dancing"?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.907
Oh.

10:10.677 --> 10:14.212
- Oh, my God.
- I'll be inside

10:14.214 --> 10:17.282
eating the rest
of the mint chip.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.684
- I'll get you the card.
- You know, I'm good.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.820
I can probably
figure this out...

10:21.822 --> 10:23.922
- No, for the vet.
- ...on my own.

10:23.924 --> 10:27.158
- Good night!
- <i>( Gabby groans )</i>

<i>♪ Bam-ba-lam,

10:30.964 --> 10:33.231
<i>♪ Bam-ba-lam,

10:40.107 --> 10:41.706
Who was that?

10:41.708 --> 10:44.109
Nobody.
It's a new neighbor.

10:44.111 --> 10:47.045
Already bothering
the heck out of me.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.813
Where's the damn ice cream?

10:50.384 --> 10:51.883
Uh-oh.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.718
What?

10:57.057 --> 10:58.223
I'll tell you later.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.225
Dad says hi.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.301
Man: <i>Our patients respond
to you, Gabby.</i>

11:10.303 --> 11:11.369
Thank you, Doctor.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.071
Don't thank me.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.807
Just make sure you stay put
after you finish your boards.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.343
Now, you're going to get
all kinds of offers.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.680
You just remember
who gave you your big break.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.682
Good morning,
Dr. McCarthy.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.951
Afternoon, Dr. McCarthy.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.220
Well, I'm off to lunch.
Oh, Ryan, by the way,

11:29.222 --> 11:31.222
your mama needs
a headcount for tonight.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.425
Are you gonna bring
that lovely lady of yours?

11:33.427 --> 11:34.959
Of course. Let us know if we need
to bring anything.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.228
All right.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.465
- Bye.
- Gabby, I'd like to have a word in private.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.367
Yeah.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.069
Woman on PA: <i>Dr. Richards
to post-anesthesia.</i>

11:44.071 --> 11:45.837
Why did you tell your dad

11:45.839 --> 11:47.038
I was coming
for dinner tonight?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.707
I have to study.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.842
Because I'm selfish
and I want what I want.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.377
Now tell me,
why are you staying

11:52.379 --> 11:53.745
all the way out there
on the Sound

11:53.747 --> 11:54.979
instead of on this side
of the bridge

11:54.981 --> 11:56.981
where I can keep you
handcuffed to my side?

11:56.983 --> 11:59.250
For your own safety
and well-being, of course.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.719
That is why. That!

12:00.721 --> 12:02.821
I have to study
for these boards.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.457
Hey, I would get
nothing done otherwise.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.229
- Hi.
- ( Molly squeals )

12:11.231 --> 12:12.831
You must be Molly.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.499
Which would make
this little girl Gabby.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.267
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.970
No, no.
I'm Gabby. She's Molly.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.238
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.439
I'm sorry we're late.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.074
There was
an emergency at work.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.976
Don't worry, honey,
I've heard it all.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.458
Just admit you were off knocking
boots with somebody's husband.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.115
Oh, I'm teasing.

12:30.117 --> 12:33.985
Oh, my goodness,
you should see the look on your face.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.020
Oh, yeah.

12:36.022 --> 12:39.257
Laura, are you giving
this young lady grief?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.392
Oh, well,
couldn't help myself.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.395
You know me...
how I get on Mondays.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.865
For the record,
I had no idea

12:46.867 --> 12:48.066
how she gets on Mondays.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.868
- Okay.
- I'm Shep.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.504
- You want to follow me back?
- Yeah, sure.

12:52.506 --> 12:55.406
I'm counting three nuggets,
so congratulations.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.009
In a month,
you're gonna be a grandma.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.145
But I'm too young!

13:00.147 --> 13:01.479
Yeah, well,
these things happen.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.381
We'll help you through it.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.050
You have any idea who the
responsible party might be?

13:06.052 --> 13:08.086
Ha! Responsible?

13:08.088 --> 13:11.022
That word doesn't even belong in
the same zip code as this guy.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.490
I meant the dog.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.859
Oh. Right. Yes.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.494
Well, apple
doesn't fall far.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.963
I have it on good information
that the suspect in question

13:18.965 --> 13:21.065
was neutered
seven months ago, Pop.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.435
You? And you?

13:24.437 --> 13:26.104
Travis:
<i>It's awful cavalier of you</i>

13:26.106 --> 13:28.273
<i>to point fingers at poor,
sweet, innocent Moby,</i>

13:28.275 --> 13:29.841
considering six months ago

13:29.843 --> 13:32.377
he was in a shelter
set to be put down.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.112
Now, I didn't save his life

13:34.114 --> 13:36.481
so he could suffer
undeserved persecution.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.983
<i>And you'd think
as a medical student</i>

13:38.985 --> 13:41.386
you'd be a little more
familiar with basic anatomy.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.589
You know,
no balls, no babies.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.024
Are you two, like...

13:46.026 --> 13:48.259
- No. Hell, no.
- No. Eww. Gross!

13:48.261 --> 13:50.995
Doc Shep,
Miss Norcross is here.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.398
Apparently her tabby
is possessed again.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.967
She needs you to do
that exorcism thing you do.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.468
Just when it
was getting good.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.573
- You tricked me.
- <i>No, no, no.</i>

14:01.575 --> 14:03.107
I just having a little fun.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.143
You showed up in my yard
all upset.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.444
And then my sister shows up...

14:06.446 --> 14:08.513
- Oh, your sister?
- Yeah, I told you.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.148
Ratty sweatpants,
no makeup.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.250
Yeah, only after one thing.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.285
Yeah, to raid my icebox.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.256
No apology necessary.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.091
Good, because
none was offered.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.862
Damn, lady. Gabby.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.263
You know, you threw
some pretty big stones

14:25.265 --> 14:27.131
in my direction
the other night.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.399
Calling my dog
stink-ass...

14:28.401 --> 14:30.869
Yeah, well,
that stink-ass and you

14:30.871 --> 14:32.537
interrupted my study

14:32.539 --> 14:35.874
with all that barking and
that awful music you play.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.275
<i>It's annoying.</i>

14:37.277 --> 14:39.344
And for that,
we apologize.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.578
Accepted.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.381
Oh, you are one
difficult lady.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.885
What do you say
we settle this

14:46.887 --> 14:48.253
over a drink
at Dockside?

14:48.255 --> 14:51.155
Ha! Okay. No.

Monica, hey!
We're over here.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.390
Man, they've been
on and off since high school.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.025
He ain't ever

- Hey.
- Hey.

- Hey! Good to see you.
- How are you? Hey, guys.

- Hey, how are you?
- Nice to see you.

- Hi.
- So...

15:35.001 --> 15:38.202
who wants to play
Squirt the Jerk?

15:38.204 --> 15:39.537
Would you like
to squirt a jerk?

15:39.539 --> 15:41.005
- Sure, let's go.
- Squirt the Jerk.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.374
All right, here we go
to squirt the jerk!

15:43.376 --> 15:44.676
Man: <i>All right! Come on.
Here we go now.</i>

15:44.678 --> 15:46.544
<i>You're almost there.
Whoa!</i>

15:46.546 --> 15:48.179
<i>He's all yours!</i>

15:48.181 --> 15:50.148
<i>That's it.
Squirt the jerk!</i>

15:50.150 --> 15:53.284
<i>You've done it!
Oh, we've got ourselves a winner!</i>

15:53.286 --> 15:57.021
Oh! Come on!

15:57.023 --> 16:01.025
<i>Congratulations, darling.
Everyone did a nice job.</i>

16:01.027 --> 16:03.361
You want to go next?

16:03.363 --> 16:05.496
- Let's get a candy apple.
- Candy apple?

16:05.498 --> 16:07.966
- Will you buy me one?
- You want candy or caramel?

16:07.968 --> 16:10.301
I should have run away
and become a carny.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.436
You are a carny.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.974
Remember the other night
in the kitchen?

16:15.976 --> 16:17.642
When I said, "Uh-oh"?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.110
Yeah.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.113
As in, "Uh-oh...

16:22.115 --> 16:24.115
<i>you just met your wife."</i>

16:24.117 --> 16:26.217
I'm just gonna
give you some...

16:29.255 --> 16:33.124
Well, look who it is.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.593
Wow. Can't seem
to get away from you.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.995
Yeah, I was gonna
walk on by,

16:36.997 --> 16:38.262
but he wanted to say hello

16:38.264 --> 16:40.231
and meet
the new doctor and...

16:40.233 --> 16:42.266
Well, I'm not technically
a doctor yet,

16:42.268 --> 16:44.502
but it is a pleasure,
Mr. Monkey.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.205
- Hello!
- Hello!

16:47.207 --> 16:48.539
Turns out
you were right.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.541
We do need tickets
for the bigger rides.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.011
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:53.013 --> 16:56.014
Ryan, this is Travis.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.283
He's my vet.

16:59.285 --> 17:03.654
And, Travis,
this is Ryan McCarthy, my boyfriend.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.156
Nice to meet you, Ryan.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.392
Hey, you want to ride
that rusty old Cyclone?

17:07.394 --> 17:09.694
I heard it only killed
four people this year.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.396
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:11.397 --> 17:13.364
Monica,
this is Gabby and Ryan.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.598
- And this is Monica.
- Hi.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.800
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.135
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.037
- Hello.
- <i>How are you?</i>

17:19.039 --> 17:20.805
- You're the vet here in Wrightsville.
- That's right.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.373
My father's been
going there for years.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.674
I see the resemblance.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.242
Dr. McCarthy.
He's got two pugs.

17:25.244 --> 17:29.781
- That's right.
- Yeah, he does.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.616
All right, folks.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.519
We're going to let some
rusty carnival ride maim us.

17:34.521 --> 17:35.787
- So...
- Fun.

17:35.789 --> 17:37.588
...y'all have a good night.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.723
- Ryan, it was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you guys.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.158
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.660
Gabby, see you back
at the ranch.

17:44.697 --> 17:48.566
He's... he's also
my neighbor.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.302
Yeah. I know.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.172
Um, should we go
on those bumper cars?

17:54.174 --> 17:55.573
- Yes.
- Let's do it, right?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.575
Let's go.
Come on.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.269
Hey!

18:25.271 --> 18:26.471
Hey, girl.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.773
Monica:
<i>Made you something.</i>

18:36.116 --> 18:37.782
Don't work too hard.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.196
What the hell
you looking at?

18:52.198 --> 18:53.898
( whimpers )

18:53.900 --> 18:56.434
- Hi.
- Ryan: <i> Hey, hey!</i>

18:56.436 --> 19:00.404
( chattering )

19:03.409 --> 19:05.009
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.153
Gabby: <i>Is this how
you hold it, honey?</i>

19:15.155 --> 19:16.554
Ryan: <i>Yeah, sweetie.
You got it.</i>

19:16.556 --> 19:18.523
<i>Okay, here goes.</i>

19:20.293 --> 19:22.693
- What in the world?
- <i>( Ryan laughs )</i>

19:22.695 --> 19:25.363
That's my girl. Whoo!

19:25.365 --> 19:26.631
I do believe
we've been hustled.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.166
Speak for yourself.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.934
I knew she was
holding back 'cause...

19:29.936 --> 19:31.435
<i>look at her.
She's got that look.</i>

19:31.437 --> 19:33.838
Okay, I'll come clean.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.308
I've actually been playing
since I was nine.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.710
I told you.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.679
We had three holes on the
property where I grew up

19:41.681 --> 19:42.847
with a water hazard.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.315
With a water hazard, see?

19:44.317 --> 19:46.317
- Gracious.
- I got kind of good.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.585
Oh, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.853
Don't you have
a flight to catch, doctor?

19:48.855 --> 19:50.588
- Gabby: Oh.
- Ryan: <i> Yes, sir.</i>

19:50.590 --> 19:53.257
Can't somebody else go
supervise the Atlanta opening?

19:53.259 --> 19:54.458
Who would you suggest,
Maryanne?

19:54.460 --> 19:56.194
After all,
our name is on the door.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.196
I just have to go
shake a few hands.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.531
Make sure the ship
is sailing straight.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.732
<i>Be back in a few weeks.</i>

20:01.734 --> 20:03.734
- I know.
- You better stay away

20:03.736 --> 20:05.503
from all those
pretty interns, hear?

20:05.505 --> 20:08.739
You remember that one
back up in Charleston

20:08.741 --> 20:10.474
that couldn't keep
her hands off of you?

20:10.476 --> 20:12.476
Sure do.
I'm going to marry her one day.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.613
Oh. Oh, really?

20:15.615 --> 20:18.349
Well, who knows?
Two or three years,

20:18.351 --> 20:19.884
maybe Gabby and Ryan
will be opening

20:19.886 --> 20:21.485
that Savannah
facility together.

20:21.487 --> 20:24.388
- I should get going.
- Oh, look at that time!

20:24.390 --> 20:26.724
See, I knew
that would do it.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.464
Thanks.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.772
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.909
So, seems like
you and Monica

20:44.911 --> 20:46.777
are picking up right where
you left off, huh?

20:46.779 --> 20:48.246
Don't make a thing
out of it.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.513
I'm not making
a thing out of it.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.649
- You are.
- I'm just saying,

20:51.651 --> 20:53.517
seems like maybe she's
sticking around this time.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.453
Mmm.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.388
I'm sure you know she rented
a place on the mainland,

20:57.390 --> 21:00.791
but did you know she planted
herself a vegetable garden?

21:00.793 --> 21:03.728
- Did she now?
- Ordered cable.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.997
- Premium cable.
- Ooh.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.732
That means something.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.667
It means she can eat a salad
and watch Animal Planet.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.535
( chuckles )
Mm-hmm.

21:11.537 --> 21:14.005
What are you busting
my chops about this?

21:14.007 --> 21:18.542
I feel like if anybody'd
be into it, it'd be you.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.478
Hey, I love Monica.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.746
If y'all ended up together,

21:21.748 --> 21:24.315
I'd be totally happy.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.018
But?

21:27.020 --> 21:28.819
I know you.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.581
What's that
supposed to mean?

21:32.625 --> 21:35.626
Remember what Mommy used
to say about opportunity?

21:35.628 --> 21:38.629
She said opportunity
is missed by most people

21:38.631 --> 21:39.897
because it's
dressed up in overalls

21:39.899 --> 21:41.432
and it looks
a lot like work.

21:41.434 --> 21:44.368
No, Thomas Edison
said that, not Mama.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.570
And I thought you
were in grad school.

21:46.572 --> 21:49.373
Shut up.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.642
I'm just saying
maybe instead of overalls,

21:51.644 --> 21:53.778
your opportunity is dressed up
in green hospital scrubs

21:53.780 --> 21:56.781
and lives about 100 feet
from your back door.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.050
But it is work,

21:59.052 --> 22:00.918
and my big brother
does not like it

22:00.920 --> 22:02.520
when things
don't come easy.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.588
How dare you?

22:04.590 --> 22:06.691
I ought to squirt you
in the eye with this lemon.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.461
- Drop it.
- Don't.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.897
No. You won't. Aah!

22:18.871 --> 22:23.040
Hi. Can you...
can you open?

22:24.877 --> 22:26.043
Uh, puppies!

22:26.045 --> 22:28.346
Oh, you're half dressed.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.947
You're naked.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.016
Um, but puppies.
Thank you.

22:32.018 --> 22:35.378
Oh, sorry.
Something's wrong. She's in pain.

22:35.888 --> 22:39.590
( whimpering )

22:47.367 --> 22:49.767
- Gabby?
- Yeah?

22:49.769 --> 22:52.370
We're all good now.

22:52.372 --> 22:55.039
She's been asking for you.
Come on.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.508
She was crying
and vomiting.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.643
She had a uterine prolapse.

22:59.645 --> 23:00.911
Oh.

23:00.913 --> 23:03.013
Oh, I knew
something was wrong.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.583
You were in
so much pain.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.886
Hey, Molly.
You're a mama.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.156
What am I going to do
with all you guys?

23:12.158 --> 23:15.993
Whatever you do,
don't name them.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.028
Makes it harder
to put them up for adoption.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.498
- Okay.
- And you should probably build them a pen.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.501
I'd be happy to help you,
if you'd like.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.069
I mean,
unless Ryan wants to.

23:25.071 --> 23:29.607
Uh, no.
He's out of town for a few weeks.

23:29.609 --> 23:33.511
But I am a handy gal,
so I can figure it out.

23:33.513 --> 23:36.514
Well,
I should probably

23:36.516 --> 23:38.516
take her in
to monitor her.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.785
What? To the clinic?

23:40.787 --> 23:42.920
- Now?
- Yeah.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.189
<i>But it's 2:00 AM.</i>

23:45.191 --> 23:46.824
It's 3:00 AM.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.793
I thought you just said
she was okay.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.195
Hang on. I did.
She's doing good.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.830
It's just a precaution.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.865
Is that necessary?

23:54.867 --> 23:56.534
Well, most
precautions aren't.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.968
It's why we call them
precautions.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.804
Wow. You're being smug.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.105
No, no.
I'm being honest.

24:01.107 --> 24:04.041
That's smug.
You're so smug! Oh, wow.

24:04.043 --> 24:07.845
Good Lord,
you bother me to no end.

24:12.018 --> 24:16.053
Wait. Where will you sleep?

24:16.055 --> 24:17.621
I'm not going to sleep.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.890
I'm like an owl.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.459
They're gonna be
all right.

24:21.461 --> 24:25.095
Thank you, Travis.

24:25.097 --> 24:28.766
I think that's the first
time you said my name.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.000
I like it.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.504
Good night.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.906
Good night.
Good night.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.141
Okay.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.649
<i>( puppies whimpering )</i>

24:49.522 --> 24:50.855
Must be pretty.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.523
Hmm?

24:52.525 --> 24:54.758
If you see a man
sleeping on a cold floor,

24:54.760 --> 24:58.162
there's sure to be
a beautiful woman nearby.

25:06.506 --> 25:07.771
Well, Miss Alice,

25:07.773 --> 25:09.640
I hear
John Cougar Mellencamp

25:09.642 --> 25:11.775
is scratching himself
something terrible.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.644
Why don't you come on back?
We'll take a look-see.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.913
Oh. Okay.

25:15.915 --> 25:19.049
But Shep knows him so well,
I don't mind waiting.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.185
Yeah. We're all full up today.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.654
Shep's busy, so you're just going to
have to deal with me.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.756
Come on back.
Come on, bud!

25:25.758 --> 25:27.191
( muttering )

25:27.193 --> 25:29.527
- Back on your right.
- Okay.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.895
Come on. Yeah!

25:32.698 --> 25:34.865
- Hey!
- Hi.

25:34.867 --> 25:38.802
If I were you, I'd build a pen in either
the garage or the laundry.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.905
And for God's sake,
don't give them names.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.775
You and Travis have
exactly the same shtick.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.677
You know that?

25:46.679 --> 25:47.878
Yeah, well, I don't know whether
he gets it from me

25:47.880 --> 25:49.613
or I get it
from him sometimes.

25:49.615 --> 25:52.950
There's nothing cuter
than puppies in a basket.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.085
Got the goods, Doc.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.087
- Good.
- Can we trust her?

25:57.089 --> 25:59.223
Yeah, come on.
Let's not make a thing out of it.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.791
What the hell you doing?

26:02.161 --> 26:04.161
What's it look like?

26:04.163 --> 26:05.896
Well, it looks like
you're swapping out

26:05.898 --> 26:07.665
a dead lizard
for a live lizard.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.832
Yeah, that's right.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.834
Is that for that
little girl out there?

26:10.836 --> 26:12.169
Yeah.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.637
Don't you think
there's a little more

26:13.639 --> 26:15.940
ethical solution here?

26:15.942 --> 26:17.341
Well, what
do you suggest, CPR?

26:17.343 --> 26:20.244
You know, like,
the truth, doctor?

26:20.246 --> 26:22.780
The truth?

26:22.782 --> 26:24.982
You want to go and tell
that sweet little girl

26:24.984 --> 26:27.051
that her pet lizard is dead?

26:27.053 --> 26:28.953
She's ten years old.
She doesn't even know what death is.

26:28.955 --> 26:31.188
<i>You want to explain
death to her?</i>

26:31.190 --> 26:33.324
<i>You may as well tell her that
Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny</i>

26:33.326 --> 26:35.125
<i>don't exist
while you're at it.</i>

26:35.127 --> 26:36.794
I don't think you should
make a habit of it,

26:36.796 --> 26:38.862
but if you get a chance
to protect a kid

26:38.864 --> 26:43.934
from the heartbreak that this
world doles out so generously,

26:43.936 --> 26:45.970
I think you should seize it.

26:45.972 --> 26:49.673
Because there's lots more
where that came from.

26:49.675 --> 26:53.077
Okay.
I want you to take this

26:53.079 --> 26:55.813
and tell her
that Abracadabra

26:55.815 --> 26:57.948
has made
a miraculous recovery

26:57.950 --> 26:59.216
and is ready to go home.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.185
Me? You want me to do it?

27:01.187 --> 27:04.021
Yes, because I want you
to get used to this situation.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.123
Uh-unh.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.192
Now go. Go.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.762
( laughs )

27:14.300 --> 27:16.300
( muttering )

27:16.302 --> 27:19.303
He's going to be okay.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.405
Oh. Oh!

27:21.407 --> 27:25.776
Now, Taylor,

27:25.778 --> 27:27.311
I have something very
important to tell you,

27:27.313 --> 27:28.879
okay, honey?

27:31.917 --> 27:33.283
Go on.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.857
Abracadabra!

27:39.859 --> 27:43.794
- There he is!
- Wow!

27:43.796 --> 27:45.329
It is a miracle.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.065
He's all better now.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.434
<i>( music playing )</i>

27:50.436 --> 27:53.203
Boat day! Hey!

27:53.205 --> 27:54.805
Look, guys,
we promised the kids

27:54.807 --> 27:57.307
we'd be home for popcorn
and monster movies.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.876
<i>So let's get this
show on the road.</i>

27:58.878 --> 28:01.178
Okay, I'm letting
y'all know right now

28:01.180 --> 28:04.181
that I am hungover
and altogether irritable.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.783
So don't expect nothing more

28:05.785 --> 28:07.217
than a sunburn
out of me today.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.385
Travis:
<i>Would you do me a favor?</i>

28:08.387 --> 28:09.753
What?

28:09.755 --> 28:10.921
Would you clean those steamy,

28:10.923 --> 28:12.122
slimy fish guts
out of that nasty,

28:12.124 --> 28:13.323
<i>bloody bucket?</i>

28:13.325 --> 28:14.892
Ben:
<i>And maybe after that,</i>

28:14.894 --> 28:16.794
you can drain the grease
trap on the barbeque?

28:16.796 --> 28:18.328
And make sure you get
all the chunks of fat

28:18.330 --> 28:19.930
<i>or you're going to have
a maggot problem.</i>

28:19.932 --> 28:21.465
If y'all make me puke,

28:21.467 --> 28:23.067
I'm going to save it,

28:23.069 --> 28:24.802
put it in
little plastic bags,

28:24.804 --> 28:26.170
put it on
your pillows tonight.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.838
Believe it or not,
she's single, folks!

28:27.840 --> 28:30.074
Matt:
<i>Hey, where's Monica at?</i>

28:30.076 --> 28:31.709
Monica's sitting
this one out.

28:31.711 --> 28:32.876
You don't say?

28:32.878 --> 28:34.211
I can invite
whoever I want.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.946
- It's my boat.
- It is his boat.

28:35.948 --> 28:39.850
- It's our day!
- Ben: <i> It's our day.</i>

28:42.054 --> 28:43.954
Be nice.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.957
You know how
to pick 'em, Trav.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.093
Stephanie: <i>You've got an air
of authority</i>

28:49.095 --> 28:50.227
<i>and dignity
as the captain today.</i>

28:50.229 --> 28:51.762
- You like that?
- Yeah.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.163
Well, I'm borrowing
his ship today.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.732
Yeah, it's new.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.401
Stephanie:
<i>You seem awfully focused.</i>

28:57.403 --> 29:00.370
I'm driving,
so I can't drink.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.939
She's making me
nervous as hell.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.307
Stephanie:
<i>Woe is you.</i>

29:03.309 --> 29:05.309
Hey, y'all, this is not
a middle school dance.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.010
Go bother
somebody else.

29:07.012 --> 29:08.178
Hey, you doing all right?

29:08.180 --> 29:10.447
Hey. Yeah, I am great.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.915
Not getting seasick
on us, are you?

29:11.917 --> 29:13.183
- No.
- Good.

29:13.185 --> 29:15.185
This is unbelievable.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.453
It's great.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.188
I can't even believe
you get to come here

29:18.190 --> 29:19.423
all the time
and do this.

29:19.425 --> 29:20.791
Hey, mind if we join you?

29:20.793 --> 29:24.461
- Hi.
- <i>It's so hot.</i>

29:24.463 --> 29:27.364
<i>It's 80 degrees. Take off that sweatshirt.
Are you crazy?</i>

29:27.366 --> 29:29.333
Okay. Okay.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.068
- It's hot.
- It's the Spanish Inquisition.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.537
You can lay off.

29:33.539 --> 29:37.141
<i>( chatter continues )</i>

29:37.143 --> 29:39.503
We might be
in trouble, boy.

29:41.847 --> 29:45.349
<i>( chattering )</i>

29:45.351 --> 29:46.917
You can do it.
You're so close.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.152
Ben: Come on, Moby.
You can do it.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.987
You're going to make it!

29:49.989 --> 29:51.522
Matt: Someone needs to teach
that dog how to swim.

29:51.524 --> 29:53.957
- Cooked to perfection.
- All right, thank you, sir.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.292
Thank you, sir.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.095
Don't even
think about it.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.463
Aww.

29:59.465 --> 30:02.132
I saw that before.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.433
It's happy.
It's a happy color.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.836
Well, to good times.

30:05.838 --> 30:09.106
Stephanie: <i>Mattie and Ben have a pretty
successful loan company.</i>

30:09.108 --> 30:11.508
<i>But I keep thinking
Mattie wants out,</i>

30:11.510 --> 30:14.044
<i>like he feels like his life is
passing him by or something.</i>

30:14.046 --> 30:15.846
What do you think?

30:15.848 --> 30:18.248
None of my business.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.218
I'm not one to gossip.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.854
What about that guy?

30:23.856 --> 30:26.156
That guy?

30:26.158 --> 30:27.491
<i>My knucklehead brother?</i>

30:27.493 --> 30:29.927
I don't know.
You tell me.

30:29.929 --> 30:32.996
Well, he is the glue.

30:32.998 --> 30:38.268
The good old boy who's mastered
the art of Southern charm.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.504
Women give him
anything he wants.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.839
Anything.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.207
He gives them just...
just enough

30:43.209 --> 30:44.408
to keep them coming back

30:44.410 --> 30:46.543
and has never been in love

30:46.545 --> 30:50.881
because he backs off
when things get too hard.

30:50.883 --> 30:53.550
That's why
he has that chair.

30:53.552 --> 30:56.019
You know, the chair out in
the front of his house.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.288
That lonely chair.

30:58.290 --> 31:02.860
Well, it is just one chair.

31:02.862 --> 31:06.363
The man with one chair
likes to sit alone.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.869
You know, I sure like
talking to you.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.103
Pass it!

31:16.008 --> 31:18.876
- Yeah!
- Nice.

31:18.878 --> 31:23.881
You are in so much more trouble
than I thought.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.883
Matt: <i>Hey, over here!
Pass it!</i>

No, it is not.
Go ahead.

31:57.483 --> 32:00.050
Oh, yeah.

32:00.052 --> 32:02.252
Yeah.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.221
- Hello.
- Hello yourself.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.360
Hey, uh,
I have a confession.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.095
Okay.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.463
My friends like you better
than they like me.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.399
Yeah, yeah.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.000
I was actually afraid
that was going to happen.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.201
I just don't get it.

32:18.203 --> 32:20.070
- Yeah.
- I don't get it.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.505
I mean, you're not funny,
you're not smart.

32:21.507 --> 32:22.673
You're nothing to look at.

32:22.675 --> 32:26.243
No. I think it's, um...

32:26.245 --> 32:28.011
it speaks a little more to,
you know, you,

32:28.013 --> 32:29.413
and you're just...

32:29.415 --> 32:34.084
you feel quite mediocre
and really unattractive.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.285
I'm lowering the bar.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.520
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.

32:36.522 --> 32:37.688
That's it. That's why.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.122
So they can tolerate you.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.290
Yeah, I thought so.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.425
That makes sense.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.195
Yeah.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.399
I love it here.

32:51.103 --> 32:54.171
Thanks for coming.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.539
I'm really glad you came.

32:55.541 --> 32:59.710
Yeah, me, too.

32:59.712 --> 33:01.278
I feel really good out here.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.610
I haven't felt
like that in a while.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.620
- That's good.
- Yeah.

33:10.622 --> 33:13.390
- You dork.
- You're a dork.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.359
You keep looking at me.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.394
Ow!

33:17.396 --> 33:18.996
Son of a...

33:18.998 --> 33:20.764
You look... aah!

33:33.679 --> 33:37.114
Well, good night.

33:37.116 --> 33:40.550
I noticed you didn't eat
a lot out there today.

33:40.552 --> 33:44.154
What do you say
we throw some red meat on the grill,

33:44.156 --> 33:45.489
tell a few lies?

33:48.160 --> 33:52.195
Has anyone ever
said no to you before?

33:52.197 --> 33:53.563
"No"?

33:53.565 --> 33:56.299
<i>No. I thought so.</i>

33:56.301 --> 33:59.302
I am making history,

33:59.304 --> 34:02.039
Good night.

34:02.041 --> 34:04.408
There you go again
bothering me.

34:11.817 --> 34:13.683
She said no to us, Stink.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.284
<i>( Moby barks )</i>

34:15.286 --> 34:16.820
Yeah, I know.

34:16.822 --> 34:19.790
I'm not familiar
with that term either.

34:19.792 --> 34:21.123
Come on.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.310
<i>( Gabby sighs )</i>

34:43.581 --> 34:46.149
<i>( phone rings )</i>

35:06.138 --> 35:08.405
<i>( Moby panting )</i>

35:08.407 --> 35:10.540
If you've been
in the fish guts again...

35:13.779 --> 35:15.112
Hey.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.829
What you got?

35:33.298 --> 35:34.531
Good boy.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.534
Come on, boy.
Come on!

35:37.536 --> 35:39.136
( knocking on door )

35:43.175 --> 35:45.675
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:50.182 --> 35:52.816
- I brought wine.
- Thank you.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.151
Thank you.

36:12.304 --> 36:13.770
Handy, my ass.

36:18.544 --> 36:20.443
Well, the young 'uns
are looking good.

36:20.445 --> 36:21.711
I think they're down
for the night.

36:21.713 --> 36:25.182
Good.

36:25.184 --> 36:27.217
Damn, I thought you were just
going to whip something up.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.485
I am.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.320
If this is how you whip,

36:30.322 --> 36:31.922
I might just have to get down
on one knee right now.

36:31.924 --> 36:34.324
- Excuse me?
- Mm-hmm.

36:34.326 --> 36:36.326
My mama is an amazing cook.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.328
I just paid attention.

36:38.330 --> 36:39.696
Hang on a minute.
Is this you right here?

36:39.698 --> 36:41.865
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

36:41.867 --> 36:43.333
It's my favorite memory.

36:43.335 --> 36:46.203
It's at the property
where we grew up.

36:46.205 --> 36:50.340
We used to swim
and ride bikes and fish,

36:50.342 --> 36:53.610
and I used to put on
these silly little plays.

36:53.612 --> 36:56.213
My dad would tell me
stories at nighttime

36:56.215 --> 36:57.747
<i>about the constellations.</i>

36:57.749 --> 36:59.583
They sound like good folks.

36:59.585 --> 37:03.286
Yeah, they are.

37:03.288 --> 37:05.755
A hurricane washed it
all away, though, when I was 12.

37:05.757 --> 37:08.225
<i>Broke my heart.</i>

37:08.227 --> 37:10.560
It's funny, I wonder if that's why
that's my favorite memory.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.295
What do you mean?

37:12.297 --> 37:15.432
<i>When things go away,
you know?</i>

37:15.434 --> 37:17.300
Makes you appreciate
them so much more

37:17.302 --> 37:19.836
than when you
actually have them.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.571
Yeah.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.839
It makes you pay attention
to the things

37:22.841 --> 37:25.609
that are just
right in front of you.

37:28.447 --> 37:30.981
Okay, dinner is served

37:30.983 --> 37:33.383
on the eastern-most
botanical mezzanine.

37:33.385 --> 37:36.019
Ooh, so the porch
with the trumpet weeds?

37:36.021 --> 37:37.354
Exactly!

37:43.595 --> 37:46.035
Travis:
<i>Beautiful.</i>

37:48.867 --> 37:50.433
I'm sorry.

37:53.739 --> 37:56.573
This view we got here
is just beautiful.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.280
Gabby:
<i>Yes. The view.</i>

38:03.282 --> 38:04.814
Travis:
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

38:04.816 --> 38:07.050
I really can't
get enough of it.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.287
Yeah.

38:10.289 --> 38:12.922
It is really something.

38:12.924 --> 38:16.960
It makes you wonder
where it all comes from, doesn't it?

38:19.698 --> 38:20.864
Not really.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.434
Not really?

38:24.436 --> 38:27.304
- No.
- Okay.

38:27.306 --> 38:29.306
So you don't
believe in God.

38:29.308 --> 38:30.974
- Oh, boy.
- <i>Oh, boy!</i>

38:30.976 --> 38:32.509
This was going so good.

38:32.511 --> 38:35.078
<i>"Oh, boy"?
Don't "oh, boy" me.</i>

38:35.080 --> 38:39.649
An honest question
deserves an honest answer.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.985
All right.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.421
- I apologize.
- Okay.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.689
So?

38:45.691 --> 38:47.457
You want to know
what I believe in?

38:47.459 --> 38:48.692
Yeah.

38:50.595 --> 38:52.329
Moby, come here.

38:52.331 --> 38:54.464
Gabby: <i>Oh, he has an opinion
on this, does he?</i>

38:54.466 --> 38:57.100
Oh, yeah.
Watch this.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.036
Now, you see that?

39:00.038 --> 39:01.371
How he pushes back?

39:03.842 --> 39:05.809
<i>He does it every time,</i>

39:05.811 --> 39:07.091
and he only does it for me.

39:08.714 --> 39:10.847
Now, that's loyalty.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.850
I know it sounds stupid,

39:13.852 --> 39:16.419
but it's love.

39:18.724 --> 39:22.625
Your friends,
your family, yourself.

39:22.627 --> 39:25.895
That's all you can count on
in this world.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.432
And that's what I believe.

39:33.705 --> 39:34.985
What do you believe?

39:39.478 --> 39:41.878
I believe...

39:41.880 --> 39:45.882
in the moon,

39:45.884 --> 39:48.785
the stars.

39:48.787 --> 39:53.022
<i>It's that feeling</i>

39:53.024 --> 39:57.494
<i>that I'm a part
of something</i>

39:57.496 --> 40:00.764
<i>so much bigger
than myself</i>

40:00.766 --> 40:05.135
that I will never,
ever begin to understand.

40:07.773 --> 40:11.908
And it's something
that I cannot control,

40:11.910 --> 40:13.877
no matter how hard I try.

40:16.782 --> 40:22.051
So, if you can tell me
where that comes from

40:22.053 --> 40:27.924
<i>and why it is
so damn beautiful...</i>

40:29.528 --> 40:34.197
then I will stop saying
my prayers before bedtime.

40:36.668 --> 40:39.803
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:42.207 --> 40:43.640
Well, that was lovely.

40:43.642 --> 40:44.808
<i>It was, wasn't it?</i>

40:44.810 --> 40:46.042
We just had
the God conversation

40:46.044 --> 40:47.210
and it wasn't bad at all.

40:47.212 --> 40:50.213
It didn't go that bad.
Weird.

40:50.215 --> 40:51.815
- Whew.
- Uh-oh.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.683
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.086
The couple that
used to live here,

40:57.088 --> 41:01.591
they used to have music playing
all day and all night.

41:01.593 --> 41:02.892
You'd see them
out in the grass

41:02.894 --> 41:06.029
dancing together
on their anniversary.

41:06.031 --> 41:11.034
Gabby: <i>Oh, my God.
That is so lovely.</i>

41:11.036 --> 41:13.036
<i>What happened to them?</i>

41:13.038 --> 41:15.705
They're still around.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.040
They just got
old and fragile

41:17.042 --> 41:21.544
and moved into the home
over on Cedar and Marsh.

41:21.546 --> 41:24.914
- Together?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

41:24.916 --> 41:28.051
I love that story.

41:28.053 --> 41:31.488
<i>( music playing on stereo )</i>

41:34.192 --> 41:36.192

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.188
Did you just spin?

42:06.525 --> 42:08.057
No.

42:08.059 --> 42:10.059
I know a spin
when I see one.

42:10.061 --> 42:11.628
I'm pretty sure
I just saw you spin.

42:11.630 --> 42:15.131
You know, I...
maybe there was a twirl.

42:15.133 --> 42:17.267
Twirl, hmm?

42:17.269 --> 42:19.235
- Yeah.
- Oh!

42:19.237 --> 42:21.804
You wash, I'll dry.

42:21.806 --> 42:23.540
No. Here.
I will get it.

42:23.542 --> 42:25.975
- Come on.
- No, I'm good.

42:25.977 --> 42:30.079
All right, well,

42:30.081 --> 42:32.282
you want to dance with me
out on the grass?

42:33.852 --> 42:35.285
No.

42:35.287 --> 42:37.287
Why do you make it so hard
for me to flirt with you?

42:37.289 --> 42:40.323
Because if I made it easy,
you wouldn't flirt anymore.

42:43.828 --> 42:45.194
I shouldn't have said that.

43:03.582 --> 43:08.184
Why?

43:13.792 --> 43:16.326

43:16.328 --> 43:20.263

46:10.468 --> 46:11.901
<i>Love you.</i>

46:16.207 --> 46:18.341
Maybe you should send him
to bed a little early.

46:18.343 --> 46:20.943
- He's just fine.
- No limp, then?

46:20.945 --> 46:23.279
No, no, no.
He's... I don't know what he's doing.

46:23.281 --> 46:25.214
<i>- He's not limping.
- Thank you so much.</i>

46:25.216 --> 46:26.816
<i>- All right, okay.
- Bye-bye.</i>

46:26.818 --> 46:27.950
<i>Bye.</i>

46:37.095 --> 46:39.128
What?

46:39.130 --> 46:40.963
You don't think
it's slightly strange

46:40.965 --> 46:43.966
that John Cougar Mellencamp
is in here three times a week?

46:43.968 --> 46:45.835
Well, you know
what some folks are like.

46:45.837 --> 46:47.103
Their pets
are their children.

46:47.105 --> 46:49.005
That dog has got to be
the healthiest animal

46:49.007 --> 46:50.506
this side of
the Mason-Dixon.

46:50.508 --> 46:52.842
That woman's got
something else on her mind.

46:52.844 --> 46:54.811
Who? Mrs. Vandy?

46:54.813 --> 46:57.513
Now, Daddy,
you know her name's Alice.

46:57.515 --> 47:00.349
She's been divorced
from Mr. Vandy for the last three years.

47:00.351 --> 47:01.951
What are you getting at?

47:01.953 --> 47:04.854
- She's crushing on you!
- That's hogwash.

47:04.856 --> 47:06.088
And frankly,
you're crushing on her.

47:06.090 --> 47:07.456
There ain't no other patient

47:07.458 --> 47:08.858
you walk all the way
to the door every time

47:08.860 --> 47:11.060
just giggling
like a schoolgirl.

47:11.062 --> 47:12.829
I walk her to the door

47:12.831 --> 47:14.096
because I'm a professional
and I'm a gentleman,

47:14.098 --> 47:15.898
and we're not giggling.

47:15.900 --> 47:17.366
Stop being
such a stubborn mule

47:17.368 --> 47:22.038
and ask the pretty lady out
on a proper date already...

I'd rather
roll in poison ivy,

48:32.277 --> 48:33.442
stab rusty nails

48:33.444 --> 48:35.411
What is your deal?

48:35.413 --> 48:36.946
I rode on
your motorcycle, pal.

48:36.948 --> 48:38.080
I went in your boat.

48:38.082 --> 48:39.649
Time to do
something I want.

48:39.651 --> 48:41.217

town that's less packed.

Special thanks
to the Wrightsville Beats

49:20.658 --> 49:24.260
for that rousing rendition
of Traffic's 1969 classic,

49:24.262 --> 49:28.531
my personal favorite,
and a real birthday treat.

49:30.668 --> 49:33.369
Well, thanks for coming.
It was great to see you.

49:35.273 --> 49:39.275
Dr. Shep!
That was amazing!

49:39.277 --> 49:41.143
I had no idea
that you did that.

49:41.145 --> 49:43.412
Well, thank you,
but you're a miracle worker.

49:43.414 --> 49:44.714
It takes real guile

49:44.716 --> 49:46.082

son of mine

<i>through those doors.</i>

49:47.251 --> 49:48.484
All right, go ahead,
Your Holiness.

49:48.486 --> 49:49.752
Go ahead?

49:49.754 --> 49:51.287
I'm sure you got
some self-righteous barb

49:51.289 --> 49:52.989
you want to stick me with,
so get it over with.

49:52.991 --> 49:54.423
I don't know what you mean.

49:54.425 --> 49:55.658
Gabby and I are just
talking about the weather.

49:55.660 --> 49:57.159
Yeah.

49:57.161 --> 49:58.561
I mean, look,
isn't it beautiful?

49:58.563 --> 50:01.697
After all this time,
the sun hath returned.

50:01.699 --> 50:04.266
- There it is.
- <i>There it is.</i>

50:04.268 --> 50:06.268
- That feel better?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

50:06.270 --> 50:08.304
Stephanie:
<i>I got the cake.</i>

50:08.306 --> 50:11.774
I may have taken a few bites
for safety purposes.

50:11.776 --> 50:15.211
- Where's Dad?
- Yonder.

50:15.213 --> 50:17.580
Hope you don't mind
me inviting Gabby.

50:17.582 --> 50:20.282
I know it's always been a tradition,
just us and Dad.

50:20.284 --> 50:22.284
I hate tradition.

50:24.455 --> 50:25.621
Don't burn the steak.

50:25.623 --> 50:28.057
I'm not burning
your steak.

50:28.059 --> 50:29.592
We were lucky.

50:29.594 --> 50:31.460
The sheriff's retriever
was a patient of mine.

50:31.462 --> 50:33.729
Travis would have spent
the weekend in jail.

50:33.731 --> 50:36.332
But I never got
the truck out of the bog.

50:36.334 --> 50:39.068
It's there to this day...
bullfrogs' motel.

50:39.070 --> 50:40.302
No.

50:42.707 --> 50:45.341
You know, I feel bad, Shep.

50:45.343 --> 50:46.609
If I had known
it was your birthday,

50:46.611 --> 50:48.344
I would have gotten you
a present.

50:48.346 --> 50:51.747
Oh, no,
it's not my birthday.

50:51.749 --> 50:54.216
Travis didn't tell you?

50:54.218 --> 50:57.219
No, it's Catherine's.

50:57.221 --> 50:59.622
My wife. Their mom.

50:59.624 --> 51:02.124
She'd be 57 today.

51:03.694 --> 51:06.429
She had cancer,
you know?

51:06.431 --> 51:08.297
First in her breasts,
and then in her bones,

51:08.299 --> 51:12.168
and then...
then everywhere.

51:12.170 --> 51:16.839
Travis was 14,

51:16.841 --> 51:19.442
mad at the world.

51:19.444 --> 51:22.578
And I... I kind of...

51:22.580 --> 51:25.020
kind of fell
into the Bible.

51:26.584 --> 51:28.664
He wanted to burn it,
you know?

51:30.088 --> 51:31.454
I kind of figured
that I'd lose him

51:31.456 --> 51:33.322
if I tried to make him
see it from my side,

51:33.324 --> 51:34.557
so I didn't.

51:36.828 --> 51:38.160
Maybe...

51:39.730 --> 51:41.363
Maybe I should've.

51:44.202 --> 51:46.135
I think he turned out
all right.

51:46.137 --> 51:47.403
Yeah.

51:47.405 --> 51:49.505
Y'all quit talking
about me and come eat!

51:49.507 --> 51:51.607
Okay, here it comes.

51:51.609 --> 51:53.242
- Mmm!
- All righty.

51:53.244 --> 51:54.410
That looks amazing.

51:54.412 --> 51:55.878
A good-looking
piece of cake there.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.613
- Yeah.
- I know there is.

51:57.615 --> 51:59.281
- Yeah, what is...
- Shut up.

51:59.283 --> 52:00.483
...what you're looking for.

52:00.485 --> 52:03.285
- Yeah, okay.
- <i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

52:03.287 --> 52:06.522
All right.
Happy birthday.

52:12.830 --> 52:15.564
Oh, just... now, hold it
one second there, Gabby.

52:15.566 --> 52:18.567
There is a minor tradition.

52:18.569 --> 52:23.706
Catherine always insisted
that the birthday girl or boy

52:23.708 --> 52:27.843
had to endure a little
ceremonial cake on the face.

52:27.845 --> 52:29.445
She was a little bit
of a jokester.

52:29.447 --> 52:32.848
- A little bit.
- Really?

52:32.850 --> 52:36.318
Okay.
So who gets it?

52:36.320 --> 52:38.320
Well, you are the guest.

52:38.322 --> 52:40.723
Yeah, I mean,
that's only fair, right?

52:40.725 --> 52:43.792
- Guest of honor.
- Yeah, I am the guest.

52:43.794 --> 52:45.194
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

52:45.196 --> 52:46.328
It'll be over quick.

52:46.330 --> 52:49.331
All right, let's do it.

52:49.333 --> 52:50.900
I'm sorry.

52:50.902 --> 52:52.334
Stephanie:
<i>Okay.</i>

52:52.336 --> 52:54.904
One, two, three.

53:01.846 --> 53:03.279
I got that, yeah?

53:08.319 --> 53:09.718
Oh, my God!
It's up my nostril!

53:09.720 --> 53:10.853
- It's really good.
- Shep: <i> It is?</i>

53:10.855 --> 53:12.421
Yeah.
It's in my nose.

53:12.423 --> 53:14.356
It is... you know what?
It is really tasty.

53:14.358 --> 53:15.958
( laughing )

53:15.960 --> 53:17.326
Give me that!
Come on!

53:17.328 --> 53:19.648
Out of there!
Out of there!

53:22.300 --> 53:23.432
Okay.

53:24.869 --> 53:26.402
Thank you.

53:26.404 --> 53:27.570
- Hang in there, Daddy.
- Thank you.

53:27.572 --> 53:30.873
- Love you.
- Good night.

53:30.875 --> 53:33.342
Are you really going to let him
drive home like that?

53:33.344 --> 53:34.877
He's not driving anywhere.

53:34.879 --> 53:37.880
Yeah, he's just going
to say good night to Mama.

53:37.882 --> 53:40.216
She's just up
the road a ways.

53:40.218 --> 53:43.886
I'll check in on him
in a few shakes.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.888
- Good night, lovely.
- Good night.

53:45.890 --> 53:47.890
- So glad you're here.
- That was so much fun.

53:47.892 --> 53:49.758
Thank you...
for the cake.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.460
Thanks for that,
yeah.

53:51.462 --> 53:53.362
- I love you, dipshit.
- Yeah, I love you.

53:53.364 --> 53:55.764

- Stephanie: <i> Night, y'all.</i>

53:55.766 --> 53:57.967
Gabby: <i>I should get started
on the dishes.</i>

53:57.969 --> 53:59.335
You should not.

53:59.337 --> 54:00.669
It's my house,
my dishes.

54:00.671 --> 54:02.871
It'll take me
two and a half shakes.

54:19.457 --> 54:21.290
( sighs )

54:51.889 --> 54:54.356
Yeah. Hi,
bud.

54:54.358 --> 54:57.459
<i>Yeah. Yeah!</i>

55:07.872 --> 55:11.006
There's something
I want to show you.

55:11.008 --> 55:12.441
Okay.

55:15.613 --> 55:17.012
Okay.

55:17.014 --> 55:19.648
All right, so what
I'm about to show you,

55:19.650 --> 55:21.016
I've never shown anybody.

55:21.018 --> 55:23.886
So you can't
tell a soul, all right?

55:23.888 --> 55:25.020
Okay.

55:29.627 --> 55:30.907
Yeah.

55:33.898 --> 55:35.331
All right.

56:05.596 --> 56:07.563
- Okay.
- Watch it.

56:22.146 --> 56:24.780
Welcome to my island.

56:24.782 --> 56:26.782
Your island?

56:26.784 --> 56:27.950
Yeah.

56:27.952 --> 56:29.752
My grandfather and I

56:29.754 --> 56:31.453
used to come out
here and fish.

56:33.157 --> 56:35.124
He left it to me
when he passed on.

56:37.027 --> 56:40.462
This is where I come
when I want to be alone.

56:41.766 --> 56:45.534
And, uh...
I don't know.

56:45.536 --> 56:47.669
I wanted
to show it to you.

56:52.510 --> 56:54.476
It's unbelievable.

56:57.047 --> 56:58.614
This is my favorite part.

57:01.118 --> 57:02.418
Look.

57:08.125 --> 57:10.092
From me to you, Gabby.

57:10.094 --> 57:12.561
The stars and the moon.

57:22.473 --> 57:25.441
Let's just stay
here forever.

57:38.889 --> 57:40.022
I'm glad you like it.

57:40.024 --> 57:41.457
Yeah.

57:43.761 --> 57:45.494
I do.

57:46.897 --> 57:49.064
Very much.

57:56.173 --> 58:00.175
I think John Cougar might be a
little bit of a hypochondriac.

58:00.177 --> 58:02.878
I wouldn't worry about him,
Mrs. Vandy.

58:02.880 --> 58:04.746
It's Alice, please.

58:04.748 --> 58:07.749
Oh, oh. Alice, yes.

58:07.751 --> 58:10.252
Well, thanks again,
Dr. Shep.

58:10.254 --> 58:11.653
Well, you're welcome.

58:11.655 --> 58:15.157
Here, let me, uh,
get the door.

58:15.159 --> 58:16.892
So I'll see you
next time?

58:16.894 --> 58:18.861
- Yes, yes.
- Okay.

58:33.777 --> 58:35.511
Um, Mrs. Vandy?

58:35.513 --> 58:37.179
Alice?

58:37.181 --> 58:39.915
I was thinking, um,

58:39.917 --> 58:43.118
maybe we could have
dinner sometime?

58:44.522 --> 58:47.189
Yes. I would like that.

58:47.191 --> 58:49.525
Yes, well, so would I.

58:49.527 --> 58:53.195
- Well, okay. Bye.
- Bye.

59:21.659 --> 59:23.158
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

59:23.160 --> 59:24.560
Earth to Gabby.

59:24.562 --> 59:25.661
Don't you hear
the intercom?

59:25.663 --> 59:26.728
I've been paging you.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.096
<i>( ringing continues )</i>

59:28.098 --> 59:31.633
- Oh.
- Phone call. Line one.

59:31.635 --> 59:33.869
- For me?
- Yeah.

59:38.909 --> 59:42.744
- Hello?
- Ryan: <i> Hey, babe. How are you?</i>

59:42.746 --> 59:44.012
Hi.

59:44.014 --> 59:45.180
<i>I know I should
have called earlier,</i>

59:45.182 --> 59:47.316
- <i>but I just got back.</i>
- Yeah.

59:47.318 --> 59:49.918
<i>Meet me at Dockside.
At 7?</i>

59:49.920 --> 59:51.887
<i>My parents will be there.</i>

59:51.889 --> 59:53.055
Oh.

59:53.057 --> 59:56.158
<i>( music playing )</i>

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:09.671
- Ryan: Gabby. Hi!
- Hi.

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:12.207
How are you?

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:15.177
- I missed you.
- Yeah, me, too.

01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:16.345
Come on,
my parents are over here.

01:00:16.347 --> 01:00:17.713
Let's go.

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:19.214
Gabby:
<i>Okay.</i>

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:21.683
<i>♪ Why don't
you call my name ♪</i>

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:24.319
<i>♪ Like you did
when you were lonely? ♪</i>

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:30.292
Dr. McCarthy: <i>Oh, hey, look.
Here they are.</i>

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:31.827
Come over here
and give me a hug.

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:33.028
Good to see you.

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:34.730
Good to see you.
Sit down!

01:00:34.732 --> 01:00:36.732
- She looks gorgeous.
- This place is so much fun.

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:38.634
Caught you off guard.

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:39.935
<i>I don't know why we've
never been here before.</i>

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:41.236
I'm sorry.
I should have called sooner.

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:42.638
Things just wrapped up
quicker than I thought.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.839
No, it was
a nice surprise.

01:00:43.841 --> 01:00:45.007
Evening, folks.

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:46.375
Dr. McCarthy:
<i>Travis!</i>

01:00:46.377 --> 01:00:48.310
- <i>How the hell are you?</i>
- Nice to see you.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:50.379
<i>Mary, you remember
Shep's son Travis, don't you?</i>

01:00:50.381 --> 01:00:51.813
So you're the one
I should thank

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.116
for fixing Cotton's eye
last month.

01:00:54.118 --> 01:00:55.384
<i>Ryan, did Daddy tell you</i>

01:00:55.386 --> 01:00:57.819
<i>Cotton Blossom
got stung by a bee?</i>

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:00.389
<i>His poor little eye swelled
up the size of a walnut.</i>

01:01:00.391 --> 01:01:02.124
Dr. McCarthy: <i>Travis, why don't you
pull up a chair and join us?</i>

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:04.292
Ryan just got back in town,
and we decided

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:05.694
<i>we were going to
slum out here</i>

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:07.229
<i>in Wrightsville
in his honor.</i>

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:09.131
Thank you, Doc. I'd like to,
but I got an early morning,

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:12.100
and I just wanted
to say hello.

01:01:12.102 --> 01:01:13.835
Ryan. Gabby.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.706
Good night, y'all.

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:18.974
Good night.

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:20.842
Nice young fella there.

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.978
Maryanne:
<i>He certainly is my hero.</i>

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.846
Dr. McCarthy:
<i>So, tell me,</i>

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.114
<i>how was the opening
in Atlanta?</i>

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:27.683
A huge success.

01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:29.017
Really good
that I went.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:30.852
- <i>Meet Dr. Stevenson?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:33.014
- <i>Yep.</i>
- Would you excuse me a minute?

01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:35.390
I'll be just a minute.

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:38.360
Where you going?
Gabby?

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:41.963
Travis?

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:44.833
Are you going to tell him?

01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:47.002
- Please listen to me.
- Are you going to tell him?

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:49.037
- I didn't know he was coming...
- Are you going to tell him?

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:51.139
I don't know!

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:52.374
I don't know.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:55.010
I get it.

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:56.344
So it's all right
to fool around

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:57.946
in the back seat
with a country boy,

01:01:57.948 --> 01:01:59.881
but as soon
as summer camp's over,

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.017
rich girls go home to their
rich boyfriends, is that it?

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:04.086
How dare you?

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:05.454
You don't know anything
about my life.

01:02:05.456 --> 01:02:06.822
I know enough.

01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:08.490
Oh, really?

01:02:08.492 --> 01:02:11.493
Well, guess what,
I know about you, too, country boy.

01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:13.895
You see something you like
and you go after it.

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:15.430
You're damn right I do.

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:17.132
Not because you want to,
not because you need it...

01:02:17.134 --> 01:02:18.300
because you just
want to win.

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:21.069
I want you.

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:26.374
We never talked about
what this was.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:28.176
It just happened so fast.
We got caught up.

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:30.879
Caught up? Is that what happened?
We got caught...

01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:32.914
We both knew this was coming
around the corner.

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.349
Neither of us
wanted to acknowledge it.

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.384
All right.
All right, well, here it is.

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:38.520
It's right here,
right in front of us.

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:40.355
So let's acknowledge it.

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:43.859
We had an amazing time.

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:47.529
One of those ground-shaking,
life-altering,

01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:50.132
knock you
on your ass months,

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:53.135
and I wish it could be more.

01:02:53.137 --> 01:02:57.005
But this is...
this is all I get.

01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:58.173
So what about you?

01:02:58.175 --> 01:03:01.009
No.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:03.345
No, see,
that is not fair.

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:05.080
How am I supposed
to know how you feel?

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:06.481
I love you.

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:08.450
You hear me?
I love you.

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:09.518
I'll say it again.
I love you.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.986
I'll say it
a million times.

01:03:10.988 --> 01:03:13.955
I love you,
I love you, I love you.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.957
I knew it the second
you walked into my yard

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:17.225
ready to rip me a new one.

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:20.495
Hell, my damn dog knew it.

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:24.232
Now, do you remember
what you said to me on my island,

01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:27.235
holding my hand
under the stars?

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:29.204
You said,
"Let's stay here forever."

01:03:31.508 --> 01:03:33.842
Well, we can.

01:03:33.844 --> 01:03:35.210
Me and you.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.080
Come home with me.

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:41.950
Come home.

01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:47.522
We'll go in there together
and we'll tell them...

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:49.825
together.

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:54.569
That is what you want,
isn't it?

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:00.502
Isn't it?

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:17.485
I don't know.

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:25.160
- All right.
- No.

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:26.294
- All right.
- No.

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:28.230
All right.

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:57.025
Gabby's voice:
<i>"Dear Travis,</i>

01:04:57.027 --> 01:05:01.963
<i>I feel like such a coward
writing this letter.</i>

01:05:01.965 --> 01:05:05.267
<i>After you left,
I told Ryan everything.</i>

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:07.636
<i>He yelled and cussed.</i>

01:05:07.638 --> 01:05:11.306
<i>He called me just about
every name in the book.</i>

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:14.209
<i>He stormed out
and told me to go to hell."</i>

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:27.255
<i>But in the morning,
he came back</i>

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.137
<i>and he asked me
to marry him."</i>

01:05:33.397 --> 01:05:37.532
<i>Got to thinking that life is held
together by choices,</i>

01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:39.267
<i>one after the other."</i>

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:42.537
Oh, so cute!

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:46.274
<i>"All shapes and sizes."</i>

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.542
So cute.

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:49.978
<i>"Right or wrong
doesn't matter,</i>

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.081
<i>because life
just keeps unfolding.</i>

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:57.452
<i>It won't wait around
for you.</i>

01:05:57.454 --> 01:06:00.989
<i>If you sit still,
it could pass you by altogether."</i>

01:06:03.527 --> 01:06:05.126
( cheering )

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.729
- Happy anniversary!
- Ten years!

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:15.570
Hi.

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:17.539
Hi.

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:19.274
Gabby's voice: <i>"I guess I'd like
to believe</i>

01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:21.009
<i>all those choices
are made for us</i>

01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:24.212
<i>the instant we enter
into this world.</i>

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:27.282
<i>Because if that's true,</i>

01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:30.685
<i>then we're exactly where
we're supposed to be...</i>

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:32.087
<i>forever."</i>

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:35.023
Here you go.

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:37.125
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

01:06:46.036 --> 01:06:48.169
You, uh...

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:52.040
you seem like
you're somewhere else tonight.

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:55.110
I know.
I'm sorry.

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:57.278
I'm just
a little wiped out.

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:06.354
You'll never look at me
the way you look at her.

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:11.634
It's true.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:14.629
I know it.

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:18.533
I'd hate her for it
if I was one of those women,

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:19.701
but I'm not.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.069
Come on, now.

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:23.038
Travis, I, uh...

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:28.410
I'm going to give you
some friendly advice,

01:07:28.412 --> 01:07:31.112
and then I'm going to
go home and cry, okay?

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:37.152
Swallow your pride.

01:07:37.154 --> 01:07:40.288
You want to be the guy
that shows up in ten years

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.557
with flowers in your hand,
Moby by your side,

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:44.492
hoping that
she'll hear you out?

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:47.529
Praying she'll understand
why you quit so easy?

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:52.434
Because that's all
any woman wants,

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:54.356
is a man who's
gonna fight.

01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:58.840
So why don't you
just do it now

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:01.209
and save yourself
a whole decade?

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:12.746

- You?

What are you doing here?

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:21.342
Mr. Holland.
Mrs. Holland.

01:11:21.344 --> 01:11:23.411
I'm Travis Shaw.
Maybe you've heard of me?

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:27.015
Maybe not. Okay.

01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:29.350
Um, well, I'm here today

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:32.487
to tell you that I love Gabby
something terrible,

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:34.022
and I was hoping I could
take her off your hands.

01:11:34.024 --> 01:11:36.758
- Right.
- Young man,

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.660
we love Gabby
something terrible, too,

01:11:38.662 --> 01:11:41.396
but you are barking
up the wrong tree.

01:11:41.398 --> 01:11:43.965
If you're here
for Gabby's hand,

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:45.900
you might want to ask
her parents.

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:47.835
- No! No, no, no.
- Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:49.837
- No! No, no, no.
- I just assumed that they were...

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:52.774
- It's quite all right, Travis.
- It's nice to meet you.

01:11:52.776 --> 01:11:53.941
So nice to meet you.
Pleasure.

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:55.643
Why are you here?

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.011
I saw you with her
on the porch.

01:11:57.013 --> 01:11:58.379
No, hang on now.

01:11:58.381 --> 01:11:59.447
- On the boat.
- Hang on.

01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:00.715
- No, I saw you!
- Hang on.

01:12:00.717 --> 01:12:02.016

where you left off.

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:03.751
Gabby, stop!

01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:07.021
Listen to me, please.

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:08.556
I love you.

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.826
Well, I don't love you.

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:13.695
Mother: <i>Oh, hush!
You do, too.</i>

01:12:13.697 --> 01:12:17.498
Knew it the second you walked inside
and set your eyes on him,

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.500
biting your lip
the way you do.

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:22.370
Mom! He is a walking
cautionary tale!

01:12:22.372 --> 01:12:24.505
- Now, hang on a minute.
- You are!

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:26.040
Gabby, you've been
waiting for him to show

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:27.608
ever since you got home
and you know it.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:28.776
Dad!

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:30.044
Whose side
are you on, anyway?

01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:31.913
Mr. Holland,
Mrs. Holland,

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:34.482
I'm so sorry for the confusion
and the intrusion...

01:12:34.484 --> 01:12:35.650
Yeah!

01:12:35.652 --> 01:12:36.784
But I love this woman

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:38.786
and I would love
a blessing from you,

01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:39.921
whether it's a wink
or a nod...

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:41.089
Oh, my God!
A blessing?

01:12:41.091 --> 01:12:42.924
Or anything
that you could give me.

01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:44.759
You got a ring, son?

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:46.794
What? What? What?
No, no, no.

01:12:46.796 --> 01:12:48.796
What the hell
is going on here?

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:49.964
Mom? No!
No, no, no.

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:51.866
I am not
marrying this man.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.401
Here.

01:12:53.403 --> 01:12:54.535
This was her grandma's.

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.537
What?
Oh, my God!

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:58.806
Hello?
I am right here!

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:00.441
- Gabby.
- No!

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:02.810
- Gabby.
- No, no, no.

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:05.747
You should probably
take a knee, son.

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:06.981
- Dad!
- Right.

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:08.149
- Yeah.
- Thanks again.

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:09.984
Gabby.

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:14.489
I think I pretty much
said all the words,

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:17.859
so all I need is a lifetime
to prove it to you.

01:13:19.496 --> 01:13:20.862
Will you marry me?

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:27.402
No!

01:13:28.805 --> 01:13:29.971
Well, yes.

01:13:29.973 --> 01:13:31.506
No!

- Yes!
- No!

- Yes!
- No!

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:35.510
Yes!

01:19:05.174 --> 01:19:06.774
<i>( thunderclap )</i>

01:19:18.321 --> 01:19:19.920
<i>( thunderclap )</i>

01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:31.198
<i>( rain pattering )</i>

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.433
<i>( tires squeal )</i>

01:20:25.288 --> 01:20:27.221
Travis's voice:
<i>So, like I was sayin',</i>

01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:32.092
<i>every path you take
leads to another choice...</i>

01:20:32.094 --> 01:20:36.130
<i>and some choices
could change everything.</i>

01:20:36.132 --> 01:20:40.267
<i>Every damn moment
for the rest of your life</i>

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:41.402
<i>hangs on it.</i>

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:46.073
<i>And, boy, have I got
a choice I gotta make.</i>

01:20:49.312 --> 01:20:51.245
I do not want to
see you back here

01:20:51.247 --> 01:20:54.281
unless you bring your wife's cobbler,
Mr. Metcalf, you hear that?

01:20:54.283 --> 01:20:57.051
- No more flag football.
- ( chuckling )

01:20:58.554 --> 01:21:00.487
Those for someone special?

01:21:00.489 --> 01:21:04.091
Someone who deserves
the stars and the moon.

01:21:04.093 --> 01:21:07.428
All I got are
these damn flowers.

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:09.330
- How are the girls?
- Terrible.

01:21:09.332 --> 01:21:11.365
Tess is texting already.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:13.067
Yeah.

01:21:15.171 --> 01:21:16.570
I'm just here
to talk to her.

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:18.239
All right, you go
right ahead, Travis.

01:21:18.241 --> 01:21:20.241
If that's what you need.
If that'll help.

01:21:23.412 --> 01:21:25.045
Too easy on me, Ryan.

01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:28.148
And you're too hard
on you, Travis.

01:21:41.964 --> 01:21:44.598
Mmm, delphiniums.
Her favorite.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.166
I thought
they were lilacs.

01:21:46.168 --> 01:21:47.635
( scoffs )

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:50.938
She's all yours.

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.206
Thank you.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:19.066
Travis: <i> Hey, babe.</i>

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:22.202
Got you some delphiniums.

01:22:22.204 --> 01:22:24.171
To be honest,
I thought they were lilacs,

01:22:24.173 --> 01:22:26.473
but Jackie says
they're delphiniums.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.220
I got a decision
I gotta make.

01:22:42.658 --> 01:22:46.093
I've been putting it off
and putting it off.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.968
It's, like, so much harder
than people can even imagine.

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:58.272
And everybody's got
an opinion on it.

01:22:59.442 --> 01:23:01.475
But since yours
is the only opinion

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:04.345
that I give a damn about,

01:23:04.347 --> 01:23:06.313
I just wanted
to run it past you.

01:23:09.251 --> 01:23:10.251
So here it is.

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:17.124
What am I gonna do...

01:23:19.562 --> 01:23:23.030
about my pickup truck?

01:23:23.032 --> 01:23:25.599
I mean, should I get
one of those new hybrids

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:28.402
that gets, like,
500 miles to the gallon

01:23:28.404 --> 01:23:31.672
and runs on babies' dreams

01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:33.741
or should I just go ahead

01:23:33.743 --> 01:23:36.777
and rebuild the tranny
in Gertrude?

01:23:39.215 --> 01:23:42.583
<i>Rebuild.
All right, great.</i>

01:23:42.585 --> 01:23:44.618
That's what I wanted
to do anyway.

01:23:47.089 --> 01:23:50.090
You know, I always had
a special place in my heart

01:23:50.092 --> 01:23:52.393
for fossil fuels.

01:23:52.395 --> 01:23:54.695
I just hate breathin'
all that clean air.

01:24:07.777 --> 01:24:10.577
What is going on
in that head of yours?

01:24:13.082 --> 01:24:15.149
Come back to me, baby.

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:20.387
We are runnin' out of time.

01:24:23.626 --> 01:24:25.692
Come bother me.

01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:51.785
All right, here we go.
Please. We need...

01:24:51.787 --> 01:24:54.121
- green.
- Green.

01:24:54.123 --> 01:24:55.355
Katie:
That was mine.

01:24:55.357 --> 01:24:58.125
Alice:
<i>Ooh, where's mine?</i>

01:24:58.127 --> 01:24:59.526
Messed up.

01:24:59.528 --> 01:25:01.095
- Travis.
- Oh, hey, Travis.

01:25:01.097 --> 01:25:02.396
Daddy.

01:25:02.398 --> 01:25:04.164
Who's winning?

01:25:04.166 --> 01:25:06.433
Well, technically speaking,
it's this pretty little girl

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:08.302
here on my left,

01:25:08.304 --> 01:25:09.670
but since she's been cheating
since round two...

01:25:09.672 --> 01:25:11.805
No, I haven't!

01:25:11.807 --> 01:25:15.342
...I'm afraid there's
gonna be some questions about that.

01:25:15.344 --> 01:25:17.578
Well, I don't wanna
spoil your fun.

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.313
Finish your game.

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.821
- Okay.
- It's your turn.

01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:30.390
Mm, okay.

01:25:30.392 --> 01:25:31.525
<i>Green.</i>

01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:46.273
Travis, I just
wanted you to know that...

01:25:48.611 --> 01:25:50.971
Send these off
to the lab, please.

01:25:51.881 --> 01:25:53.447
What do we got next?

01:25:53.449 --> 01:25:55.409
We've got
some friends here.

01:25:56.719 --> 01:25:59.186
It's gonna hurt like hell.

01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:01.688
Like pain that
I can't even...

01:26:18.274 --> 01:26:19.773
Come on.

01:26:23.746 --> 01:26:25.512
Travis: <i>"'How do you play
in the river?'</i>

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:27.614
<i>Tucker asked
Maggie the Mullet.</i>

01:26:27.616 --> 01:26:29.349
<i>'You jump like this.</i>

01:26:29.351 --> 01:26:32.619
Jump, splash,
jump, splash,

01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:34.755
jump, splash.'

01:26:34.757 --> 01:26:37.925
And Maggie was gone
in the blue river."

01:26:39.662 --> 01:26:41.962
Daddy, can you
do the voices?

01:26:41.964 --> 01:26:44.464
Mommy always
did the voices.

01:26:44.466 --> 01:26:47.868
Dad, why don't you
let me read it?

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:54.408
Okay, big guy.
Yeah, you read it.

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:56.243
"It was beginning
to get dark,

01:26:56.245 --> 01:26:59.313
and Tucker spied
a big owl up in a tree.

01:26:59.315 --> 01:27:02.382
'Hi, who are you?'
Tucker asked.

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:04.284
'Who, who, who are you?

01:27:04.286 --> 01:27:07.788
I am Willa,
the wise old owl.'

01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:11.425
'What do you do when the sun goes down?'
Tucker asked."

01:27:11.427 --> 01:27:13.460
90 days.

01:27:15.497 --> 01:27:17.731
And where'd you
get that number?

01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:19.733
Medical journals
and case studies.

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:21.368
Well, that's just
words on paper.

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:22.736
It's statistics.

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:24.805
It's well-documented,
Dr. Shep.

01:27:24.807 --> 01:27:26.707
<i>After 90 days,</i>

01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:28.408
the percentage
of trauma patients

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.744
who regain consciousness

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:33.280
decreases to
less than one percent.

01:27:33.282 --> 01:27:34.915
<i>It's a quantifiable fact.</i>

01:27:36.018 --> 01:27:38.819
I'm sorry, Travis.

01:27:38.821 --> 01:27:40.821
<i>If we reach that mark,</i>

01:27:40.823 --> 01:27:44.063
we need to know you're prepared
to carry out her wishes.

01:27:45.394 --> 01:27:47.661
This is her voice.

01:27:47.663 --> 01:27:50.564
No, it's not.

01:27:51.967 --> 01:27:55.802
That is something you do
to prepare for the future.

01:27:55.804 --> 01:28:00.274
For... for old age,
when your life is all behind you.

01:28:00.276 --> 01:28:02.309
<i>You know, you cover
for the "what ifs."</i>

01:28:02.311 --> 01:28:05.012
Nah. How could you know?

01:28:05.014 --> 01:28:08.548
How... how could you
ever really know?

01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:11.551
It's been a long time since
she's breathed on her own.

01:28:12.588 --> 01:28:14.688
Her body's tired.

01:28:17.426 --> 01:28:18.825
She's tired.

01:28:43.619 --> 01:28:46.853
( breath hitches )
I wish I could breathe for you, baby.

01:29:10.112 --> 01:29:12.646
( whispering )
Come back to me.

01:29:12.648 --> 01:29:14.348
Come home.

01:29:16.085 --> 01:29:17.551
I love you.

01:29:41.009 --> 01:29:43.410
All I have left
are memories.

01:29:45.881 --> 01:29:48.115
Trust me,
I remember everything.

01:29:50.652 --> 01:29:53.120
I remember
her coming home...

01:29:53.122 --> 01:29:55.956
day after day.

01:29:55.958 --> 01:29:59.159
Watching her...

01:29:59.161 --> 01:30:01.695
staring and thinking,

01:30:01.697 --> 01:30:04.898
I can't believe
that that woman

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.801
is my wife.

01:30:07.803 --> 01:30:09.669
I kept thinking
how many times

01:30:09.671 --> 01:30:11.738
I could've told her
I loved her.

01:30:13.108 --> 01:30:14.841
How many times
I could've showed her,

01:30:14.843 --> 01:30:16.910
how many times
I could've loved her hard.

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.580
Oh, I'd give anything
just to be with her,

01:30:20.582 --> 01:30:22.783
tell her one more...
one more time.

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:31.858
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:30:34.196 --> 01:30:36.930
Stephanie: <i> Hi, Mama.</i>

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:39.866
She's a good listener, huh?

01:30:39.868 --> 01:30:41.568
She's the best.

01:30:45.974 --> 01:30:48.475
I had to make
a choice, Steph.

01:30:51.213 --> 01:30:52.846
Just been so long.

01:30:54.483 --> 01:30:55.982
Seeing her like that.

01:30:58.086 --> 01:31:00.554
Knowing it's not
what she would want.

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:05.892
Hell, she'd be
so mad at me.

01:31:09.031 --> 01:31:12.699
Last night I told her...

01:31:12.701 --> 01:31:15.202
today I'd do it.

01:31:15.204 --> 01:31:17.938
Today I would
have the strength.

01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:28.515
But I just...
I just can't do it yet.

01:31:29.885 --> 01:31:32.252
I'm just not ready
to let her go.

01:31:42.097 --> 01:31:43.897
Me, neither.

01:31:43.899 --> 01:31:47.033
You did what
your heart told you.

01:31:47.035 --> 01:31:50.637
And if anybody has anything
to say about that,

01:31:50.639 --> 01:31:52.973
they gotta go through me.

01:32:07.656 --> 01:32:10.957

<i>Now this is the first hurricane

01:32:21.803 --> 01:32:24.871
Travis, this is crazy.
Just come with us.

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:26.273
I got some
boarding up to do,

01:32:26.275 --> 01:32:27.807
and, besides,
I don't go anywhere

01:32:27.809 --> 01:32:30.010
unless its a Category 7
or higher.

01:32:30.012 --> 01:32:32.712
Dad, there's no such thing
as a Category 7.

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:34.047
Well, aren't you smart?

01:32:34.049 --> 01:32:35.782
I hope you're not
trying to prove something.

01:32:35.784 --> 01:32:37.817
- This thing looks big.
- There's nobody to prove it to.

01:32:37.819 --> 01:32:40.287
I just wanna stay
near the hospital.

01:32:40.289 --> 01:32:43.189
Besides, I got stink-dog here
to keep me company.

01:32:43.191 --> 01:32:44.824
Let's saddle up.

01:32:44.826 --> 01:32:46.693

Ah, you're a lucky SOB.
Storm landed in Charleston.

Knocked it down
to a Category 2.

01:33:52.194 --> 01:33:55.261
Looks like the old place
could do with a lick of paint.

What are you looking for?

01:34:11.913 --> 01:34:14.914
Something that...

01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:16.416
should be here.

If I'd have been on time...

01:34:33.035 --> 01:34:35.235
It's not your fault, Travis.

01:34:35.237 --> 01:34:37.337
Get that out of your head.

01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:43.943
The world breaks
everyone, Travis.

01:34:43.945 --> 01:34:47.313
The very good,
the very gentle, the very brave.

01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:52.986
And those
it doesn't break, it kills.

01:34:52.988 --> 01:34:56.823
Is that from the good book,
Pastor Shaw?

01:34:56.825 --> 01:34:59.759
A great book.
Hemingway.

01:35:02.698 --> 01:35:05.065
There's no shame
in being a broken man.

01:35:05.067 --> 01:35:07.801
<i>I should know.</i>

01:35:07.803 --> 01:35:11.204
You just pick up
the pieces...

01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:13.473
and start rebuilding.

01:35:40.502 --> 01:35:41.835
<i>( Moby barks )</i>

01:35:45.006 --> 01:35:46.139
<i>( barks )</i>

01:35:50.011 --> 01:35:52.746
<i>( Moby continues barking )</i>

01:36:02.157 --> 01:36:04.390
<i>( barking )</i>

01:36:11.032 --> 01:36:12.766
Travis:
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:36:12.768 --> 01:36:14.300
<i>How'd you get all the
way out here, boy?</i>

01:36:14.302 --> 01:36:16.402
You can't swim.

01:36:16.404 --> 01:36:18.404
What you got there, boy?

01:36:26.014 --> 01:36:27.294
What's that?

01:36:35.323 --> 01:36:37.824
Good boy, good boy.

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:54.808
What's he doing
out there, Grandpa?

01:36:54.810 --> 01:36:59.112
Uh... just going
a little crazy.

01:37:02.818 --> 01:37:05.018
Come on, let's go
get some ice cream.

01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:07.821
Come on.

01:37:07.823 --> 01:37:10.423
<i>We've got vanilla,
we've got chocolate.</i>

01:38:36.945 --> 01:38:39.412
<i>( tinkling )</i>

01:39:03.071 --> 01:39:04.504
<i>( engine revs )</i>

01:39:39.641 --> 01:39:41.474
Mm.

01:40:04.099 --> 01:40:06.265
You're late.

01:40:07.302 --> 01:40:09.469
I'm sorry.

01:40:24.319 --> 01:40:27.487
( squawking )

01:40:35.797 --> 01:40:37.397
Jesse: <i>Mama! Mama,
you're home!</i>

01:40:37.399 --> 01:40:39.532
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:41.334
You've seen your mom
every day this week.

01:40:41.336 --> 01:40:42.602
Let's let her
get settled, okay?

01:40:42.604 --> 01:40:44.804
- My babies.
- Hi, Mommy.

01:40:44.806 --> 01:40:47.740
Oh, hi.

01:40:47.742 --> 01:40:50.209
Let me look at you.

01:40:50.211 --> 01:40:53.112
<i>( baby gurgling )</i>

01:40:53.114 --> 01:40:54.394
Hello, Gabby.

01:40:57.085 --> 01:40:58.651
Congratulations.

01:40:58.653 --> 01:41:00.753
Oh, somebody
is dying to meet you.

01:41:00.755 --> 01:41:02.822
Oh, hi.

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:06.692
( whispering )
Oh, my goodness.

01:41:26.848 --> 01:41:29.715
- Mrs. Shaw.
- Mr. Shaw.

01:41:29.717 --> 01:41:32.852
Well, welcome
to the rain-check date.

01:41:34.255 --> 01:41:36.422
What is on the menu?

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:39.125
Well, that's a...

01:41:39.127 --> 01:41:41.227
that's a good question.

01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:43.129
The kids have been
cooking all day.

01:41:43.131 --> 01:41:45.098
It, uh, started
as a pot roast,

01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:47.266
but now it's
probably a shoe.

01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:48.501
( laughs )

01:41:50.205 --> 01:41:52.772
- I'm nervous.
- So am I.

01:41:52.774 --> 01:41:55.641
Uh... but, uh...

01:41:55.643 --> 01:41:58.444
Gabby, I, uh...

01:41:58.446 --> 01:41:59.846
I know I've had
a lot of time

01:41:59.848 --> 01:42:01.380
to think about
what I'd say

01:42:01.382 --> 01:42:04.717
if, uh...
what I'd say <i> when...</i>

01:42:04.719 --> 01:42:08.154
and, um... dang it!

01:42:08.156 --> 01:42:11.324
I had this all sorted out.
I did. Now I can't, um...

01:42:11.326 --> 01:42:14.894
Travis, I heard you.

01:42:17.165 --> 01:42:22.368
I heard... every word
that you said.

01:42:26.341 --> 01:42:28.774
You were breathing
for me, baby.

01:42:33.314 --> 01:42:35.681
Your heart beat for mine.

01:42:39.921 --> 01:42:41.921
We got
through this together.

01:42:52.901 --> 01:42:57.503
You reckon Moby had this all
planned from the get-go?

01:42:57.505 --> 01:42:59.906
Moby? What?

01:42:59.908 --> 01:43:01.774
You're gonna give Moby
all the credit?

01:43:01.776 --> 01:43:04.577
What about my sweet,
innocent Molly?

01:43:04.579 --> 01:43:06.379
Sweet and innocent?

01:43:06.381 --> 01:43:08.414
Are you saying she's
not sweet and innocent?

01:43:08.416 --> 01:43:09.582
- No.
- Yes.

01:43:09.584 --> 01:43:12.718
- Lady.
- I know.

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:14.887
You bother me, too.

01:43:25.867 --> 01:43:28.467
I'm really worried
about this pot roast.

01:43:28.469 --> 01:43:30.536
We're probably gonna
have to order a pizza.

01:43:30.538 --> 01:43:31.737
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:43:31.739 --> 01:43:34.707
( chuckling )

01:43:54.596 --> 01:43:56.896
- You guys ready?
- Mm-hmm.

01:43:56.898 --> 01:44:00.466
One... two...
