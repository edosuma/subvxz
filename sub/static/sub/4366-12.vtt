WEBVTT

00:01.301 --> 00:03.585
You are being watched.

00:03.586 --> 00:06.004
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.006 --> 00:10.642
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.861
I know, because I built it.

00:12.863 --> 00:15.213
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:15.215 --> 00:17.065
but it sees everything...

00:17.067 --> 00:19.852
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:19.854 --> 00:21.270
people like you,

00:21.272 --> 00:24.940
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:24.942 --> 00:28.327
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.178
But I needed a partner--

00:30.180 --> 00:32.898
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:32.900 --> 00:37.085
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:37.087 --> 00:39.037
You will never find us.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.039
But victim or perpetrator,

00:41.041 --> 00:43.959
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.200
Your coffee's
getting cold, Detective.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.226
Nice suit.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.594
You finally found me.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.979
But I don't hear any sirens

01:36.981 --> 01:38.931
or see you
reaching for your gun.

01:38.933 --> 01:42.968
I looked for a
"I'm sorry I got you shot" card,

01:42.970 --> 01:45.237
but they were all out.

01:46.823 --> 01:50.809
I had no idea
what Snow was capable of...

01:50.811 --> 01:53.829
That he'd actually
try to kill you.

01:53.831 --> 01:56.949
Why did you contact me, Carter?

01:56.951 --> 01:58.617
Got a lot of questions.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.319
Well, you managed
to lose your tail.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.737
That's quite a feat.

02:01.739 --> 02:03.655
Those CIA boys
spend a lot of time

02:03.657 --> 02:05.240
learning how to be invisible.

02:05.242 --> 02:07.376
You think Snow
is my only problem?

02:07.378 --> 02:09.077
Is there another
agency following you

02:09.079 --> 02:10.127
that I'm not aware of?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.381
You've got an entire NYPD

02:12.383 --> 02:14.333
task force looking for you.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.001
Had to run two lights
getting here

02:16.003 --> 02:18.754
just to make sure my own people
weren't trailing me.

02:18.756 --> 02:22.474
I'm a cop,
which means I've got rules.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.376
Rules that can't be broken.

02:24.378 --> 02:28.647
But, um...
I want to know more.

02:33.152 --> 02:35.687
Once you go down that road...

02:35.689 --> 02:39.557
There's no looking back.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.576
How are you getting
your information?

02:41.578 --> 02:45.080
All I can tell you is we hear
about people in danger.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.865
Or people who are causing it.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.066
Why me?

02:48.068 --> 02:50.085
Because your moral
compass is pointed

02:50.087 --> 02:52.921
in the right direction.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.691
Because I'm tired
of you chasing me.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.430
How does this work?

03:10.139 --> 03:11.690
Andrea Gutierrez?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.943
Civil litigation attorney
with a sealed juvie record.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.962
I need it unsealed, Carter.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.763
What did I
just say about rules?

03:18.765 --> 03:21.233
You have your rules...

03:21.235 --> 03:26.371
And you have the chance
to save a life.

03:26.373 --> 03:30.575
It's your choice.

03:33.830 --> 03:35.680
I'll be in touch.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.924
You look worried, Finch.

03:45.926 --> 03:49.461
Did your tailor
move out of the city?

03:49.463 --> 03:51.763
How was your breakfast meeting
with Detective Carter?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.398
You heard her.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.434
She wants to know how
we get our information.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.185
She can never know
about the machine.

03:57.187 --> 04:01.239
I doubt if she'd
believe it if I told her.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.576
She did agree to get us
Andrea Gutierrez's juvie file.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.528
Well, that's a step
in the right direction.

04:06.530 --> 04:09.581
What else did you find out
about our lawyer?

04:09.583 --> 04:12.584
Andrea Gutierrez,
born and raised in Queens.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.153
Got her GED after
dropping out of high school.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.838
Worked her way
through community college,

04:16.839 --> 04:19.656
then SUNY New Paltz
and Queens College law

04:19.659 --> 04:21.625
where she studied
civil litigation.

04:21.628 --> 04:24.463
She's a scrapper.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.847
Ambitious.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.216
Just trying to make
a better life for herself.

04:28.218 --> 04:30.802
Yes, but a better life
can be expensive.

04:30.804 --> 04:34.856
She owes $50,000
in student loans...

04:34.858 --> 04:37.526
And another $20,000
on her credit cards.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.860
That's a lot of debt.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.979
Maybe she borrowed money
from the wrong person.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.648
It's possible; She owes money
on her business, too.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.484
Excuse me. Sorry.

04:47.403 --> 04:50.372
Apparently she's trying to
carve out a niche for herself

04:50.374 --> 04:53.542
by suing the State on behalf
of inmates and ex-cons

04:53.544 --> 04:55.494
with grievances
from their stay behind bars.

04:55.496 --> 05:00.532
How's that working out for her?

05:00.534 --> 05:02.700
She's 0-for-6.

05:04.253 --> 05:09.474
I imagine she hopes her current
case will be lucky number seven.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.268
Objection, Your Honor.

05:20.270 --> 05:21.770
Relevance of this testimony?

05:21.772 --> 05:23.238
Your honor,
I'm just trying to prove

05:23.240 --> 05:24.389
my client's only wrongdoing

05:24.391 --> 05:26.491
was not cleaning
his apartment well enough.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.493
The drugs were old, dusty,

05:28.495 --> 05:30.445
from the days
before Mr. King was clean.

05:30.447 --> 05:32.914
Objection. Is Ms. Gutierrez
testifying now?

05:32.916 --> 05:34.583
Judge O'Connor,
this case is baseless,

05:34.585 --> 05:36.835
just like every other
ex-con nuisance case

05:36.837 --> 05:38.787
Ms. Gutierrez has brought
before this court.

05:38.789 --> 05:40.539
And we, the State,
ask you to treat it as such.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.507
- Give me a break.
- Ms. Gutierrez.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.459
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

05:44.461 --> 05:48.296
I just have a hard time
taking the State seriously

05:48.298 --> 05:49.798
when it's wearing that tie.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.885
Let's adjourn
while you two grow up.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.020
Get your witnesses in order.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.922
We'll reconvene on Friday.

05:59.091 --> 06:01.276
I'll come see you tomorrow,
I promise.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.111
- And you'll bring Jacob?
- You bet.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.864
This is so wrong.
Andrea, I mean, I didn't...

06:05.866 --> 06:08.200
I didn't even do anything.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.985
Remember what I said
about not communicating

06:09.987 --> 06:11.403
with anyone from
the trial, Terrence?

06:11.405 --> 06:12.821
He's my--
He's my parole officer.

06:12.823 --> 06:14.105
Not right now, he's not.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.907
Galuska, I told you
those drugs weren't mine.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.909
I mean, you tested me, man.
Why don't you believe me?

06:17.911 --> 06:20.011
I just did my job, Terrence.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.098
Those drugs were in your place.
That makes them yours.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.250
You should have been
more careful.

06:37.597 --> 06:40.682
Thank you for calling DFS.
How may I assist you?

06:47.540 --> 06:50.158
Pastrami from Zabar's?

06:50.160 --> 06:52.494
- You must need something big.
- Terrence King's blood test.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.646
His parole officer did one
when he was arrested,

06:54.648 --> 06:57.165
and I need it to help me
prove that he wasn't using.

06:57.167 --> 07:00.942
- Did you put in a request?
- Weeks ago, but...

07:02.505 --> 07:04.522
I'll look into it, Andi.

07:04.524 --> 07:06.374
Thank you.

07:06.376 --> 07:08.593
You better go.
Boss lady's coming.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.680
I thought you were working
through lunch, Chris...

07:11.682 --> 07:13.798
Not entertaining visitors.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.017
She just came for a file.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.352
Did you go through
proper channels?

07:17.354 --> 07:19.220
I did Gloria, I swear.

07:19.222 --> 07:23.475
But those channels
are so freaking... slow.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.170
All right, to Poe finally
getting his diploma.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.471
Did Ms. Gutierrez go home?

07:53.473 --> 07:56.224
She stopped for drinks
with some friends.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.991
I was worried
you'd change your mind.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.243
Ha, not yet.

08:15.245 --> 08:19.164
I've got your girl Andrea
Gutierrez's juvie records.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.567
Teenage troublemaker,
B&E her sophomore year,

08:22.569 --> 08:24.586
and a string
of larceny charges.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.255
One moment, Carter.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.341
- What is it, Lionel?
- Carter's up to something.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.742
You need to watch your ass.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.745
I appreciate your concern
about my ass, Lionel,

08:33.746 --> 08:35.764
but I can handle
Detective Carter.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.082
I'm telling you,
she's talking to someone

08:38.083 --> 08:39.183
and keeping it on the down low,

08:39.186 --> 08:42.087
working something on her own.

08:42.089 --> 08:45.306
I'll keep that in mind.

08:45.308 --> 08:46.424
You still with me, Carter?

08:46.426 --> 08:49.427
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I'm still with you.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.463
So what do we do now?

08:51.465 --> 08:53.481
We'll watch and wait.

08:53.483 --> 08:55.650
- And Carter?
- Yeah?

08:55.652 --> 08:57.569
Thanks.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.791
Mr. Reese, I'm not sure that
keeping both of our detectives

09:02.793 --> 09:05.493
in the dark is the best
course of action.

09:05.495 --> 09:07.278
This could get
really complicated.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.747
They're assets.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.915
The less they know about each
other, the safer they'll be.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.501
Right now, I'm more concerned
with Ms. Gutierrez.

09:13.503 --> 09:14.669
Okay.

09:18.424 --> 09:21.226
Finch, someone's
tailing our girl.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.261
Someone other than you?

10:04.670 --> 10:05.603
Mr. Reese?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.021
Mr. Reese,
are you all right?

10:07.023 --> 10:09.023
Yeah, wishing gunshot wounds...

10:09.025 --> 10:12.644
Healed faster right about now.

10:20.569 --> 10:23.455
Assailant's into
anabolic steroids.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.373
Where's Ms. Gutierrez?

10:25.375 --> 10:27.208
She's safe for now.

10:27.210 --> 10:30.128
But with the way
that guy handled himself,

10:30.130 --> 10:32.380
I don't know
for how much longer.

11:07.864 --> 11:10.432
Any guesses about who'd
want to kill our attorney?

11:10.434 --> 11:12.284
The guy who tried to
attack her last night

11:12.286 --> 11:13.285
looked like he'd done time.

11:13.287 --> 11:16.038
Could be, uh,
angry former client?

11:20.410 --> 11:21.627
Excuse me.

11:21.629 --> 11:23.962
Well, we need to get her files.

11:23.964 --> 11:26.615
See if the assailant
is one of her clients.

11:26.617 --> 11:29.618
Narrow down our suspects.

11:31.088 --> 11:32.754
Yes?

11:34.007 --> 11:36.592
I'll be there as soon as I can.

11:38.794 --> 11:41.096
Half day, Finch?

11:41.098 --> 11:44.132
Stay close
to Ms. Gutierrez.

11:44.134 --> 11:46.234
I'll be back soon.

12:15.882 --> 12:18.634
You cut your hair... finally.

12:18.636 --> 12:21.353
Got new glasses.
Finally.

12:24.974 --> 12:27.643
I suppose you could use
some rest before I lecture you

12:27.645 --> 12:29.528
on the perils
of underground gambling.

12:29.530 --> 12:31.563
That'd be great.
I've been up almost 48 hours.

12:31.565 --> 12:34.650
My cellmate snored
like a freight train.

12:36.703 --> 12:38.820
Happy you're home, Will.

12:38.822 --> 12:40.956
Sorry you had to
bail me out again.

12:40.958 --> 12:43.709
Well, it's good
to have you back either way.

13:02.930 --> 13:05.981
How'd you get into my office
without anyone noticing?

13:05.983 --> 13:07.299
Trade secret.

13:07.301 --> 13:08.717
I need you
to help me to find out

13:08.719 --> 13:10.569
where to buy
that brand of steroid.

13:10.571 --> 13:12.237
What, you looking to beef up?

13:12.239 --> 13:15.774
- It belonged to a guy I had
a run-in with last night.

13:15.776 --> 13:17.576
Skilled fighter.

13:17.578 --> 13:20.779
Looking to track down the gym
where he juices up.

13:22.949 --> 13:24.783
Are you having second thoughts?

13:24.785 --> 13:28.003
There's just a lot of
prying eyes around this place.

13:28.005 --> 13:29.454
You're getting paranoid,
Carter.

13:29.456 --> 13:32.841
That's a step
in the right direction.

13:37.380 --> 13:39.914
So you want to sue your boss.

13:39.916 --> 13:43.135
Wonderful, uh...
We can absolutely do that.

13:43.137 --> 13:46.521
Um, what, uh...

13:46.523 --> 13:48.190
What type of work do you do?

13:48.192 --> 13:51.893
Uh, it's um, complicated.

13:51.895 --> 13:54.563
Okay. How did you
hear about me?

13:54.565 --> 13:56.331
- A bailiff said
ex-cons with gripes

13:56.333 --> 14:00.068
against the State
is your specialty.

14:00.070 --> 14:03.155
- Is that bad information?
- Um, no, not at all.

14:03.157 --> 14:06.625
It's just I thought you were
a clear-cut civil case.

14:06.627 --> 14:08.160
The unicorn
I've been looking for...

14:08.162 --> 14:10.712
Like the perfect man.

14:10.714 --> 14:11.880
- Oh--
- Oh.

14:11.882 --> 14:14.115
Sorry, I'm all thumbs today.

14:14.117 --> 14:17.636
I do it all the time.
I'll be right back.

14:31.634 --> 14:34.319
Nicely done, Mr. Reese.
I have a signal now.

14:34.321 --> 14:36.822
How was your appointment?

14:36.824 --> 14:38.990
Quite productive, thank you.

14:38.992 --> 14:40.242
Okay.

14:40.244 --> 14:43.293
Here we go.
Okay.

14:44.814 --> 14:49.951
So, tell me, why do you
want to sue your boss?

14:49.953 --> 14:54.539
Well, my working conditions
are, um...

14:54.541 --> 14:55.841
Unsafe.

14:55.843 --> 14:57.459
I slipped and hurt my back.

14:57.461 --> 15:00.011
- Did that happen on the job?
- Just last night, actually.

15:00.013 --> 15:02.547
Mr. Reese, I've got sound
in both microphones, now.

15:02.549 --> 15:04.132
Connecting to her hard drive.

15:04.134 --> 15:06.501
I sent an email
with a virus promising

15:06.503 --> 15:09.170
40% off any purchase
at Bloomingdales.

15:09.172 --> 15:10.689
She couldn't resist
downloading it.

15:10.691 --> 15:13.341
So, what's this
boss of yours like?

15:13.343 --> 15:16.812
Very manipulative.
Secretive.

15:16.814 --> 15:19.347
We've had some
personality conflicts.

15:19.349 --> 15:21.466
I take it
he has a lot of money.

15:21.468 --> 15:25.186
He's, uh, one of those
rich loner types.

15:25.188 --> 15:28.623
Kind you'd call strange
if he didn't have so much cash.

15:28.625 --> 15:31.960
So, instead,
he's, uh, eccentric.

15:31.962 --> 15:35.547
Well, this case is going
to rack up a lot of hours.

15:35.549 --> 15:36.715
I can pay upfront.

15:36.717 --> 15:39.217
Then I can start immediately.

15:39.219 --> 15:41.319
Well, after
my next appointment.

15:41.321 --> 15:44.222
I'm, uh, running late.

15:44.224 --> 15:45.724
I'll call you.

15:45.726 --> 15:47.809
I look forward to it.

15:52.481 --> 15:55.567
Daddy!

15:55.569 --> 15:58.320
There he is.

15:58.322 --> 16:00.822
Oh.

16:00.824 --> 16:02.941
Chris did me a big favor
by picking him up

16:02.943 --> 16:04.159
from the foster family's place.

16:04.161 --> 16:06.194
When are you
coming home, daddy?

16:06.196 --> 16:07.779
I don't like my room.

16:07.781 --> 16:08.897
Andrea's gonna
get me out of here

16:08.899 --> 16:10.415
sooner than you know it,
all right?

16:10.417 --> 16:11.917
That's right, buddy.

16:11.919 --> 16:13.368
Yeah, Jacob, why don't you
go over there right now,

16:13.370 --> 16:14.586
hang with Chris for a minute

16:14.588 --> 16:16.872
and let me
finish talking with Andrea?

16:19.074 --> 16:22.260
So, um, so did you
get the blood test?

16:22.262 --> 16:24.546
Chris is working on it,
but even if we get it--

16:24.548 --> 16:27.849
Right. They still found
the drugs in my house.

16:27.851 --> 16:30.101
Maybe we can get you tested
at an independent lab

16:30.103 --> 16:32.086
and prove that you were clean.
It could help.

16:32.088 --> 16:33.722
Whatever you need, I'll do it.

16:33.724 --> 16:35.941
Look, I know I can't pay you

16:35.943 --> 16:38.810
and I know that
it's not looking good, but...

16:38.812 --> 16:42.063
Thank you.

16:42.065 --> 16:44.816
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

16:48.872 --> 16:50.822
You've found something.

16:50.824 --> 16:52.123
Brand name's Anadrol.

16:52.125 --> 16:54.776
It's a popular compound
found in some MMA gyms.

16:54.778 --> 16:58.163
Turned up in buy-and-busts
at three gyms in the boroughs.

16:58.165 --> 16:59.447
What are the locations?

16:59.449 --> 17:02.000
I'll tell you
only if I don't wind up

17:02.002 --> 17:04.551
getting called to
a crime scene, understood?

17:04.554 --> 17:08.138
You have my word, Detective.

17:10.675 --> 17:12.560
Any sign of our assailant?

17:12.561 --> 17:15.347
Third location,
and still nothing.

17:15.348 --> 17:17.965
Could be our friend
from last night

17:17.968 --> 17:20.801
decided to take the day off.

17:26.692 --> 17:29.244
Finch, I see him.

17:33.315 --> 17:35.116
Hey, you remember me?

17:35.118 --> 17:36.668
Yeah.

18:03.863 --> 18:05.346
Look out!

18:10.736 --> 18:12.904
Reese, are you okay?

18:12.906 --> 18:15.740
Yes, but I can't say the same
about the other guy.

18:15.742 --> 18:18.994
So much for not
dropping any bodies.

18:31.676 --> 18:35.095
Our dearly departed hit man,
Alonso Garcia, was an ex-con.

18:35.097 --> 18:37.013
He served three years
at Five Points

18:37.015 --> 18:38.465
for second-degree
manslaughter.

18:38.467 --> 18:40.667
But Andrea wasn't
his representative.

18:40.669 --> 18:41.968
Then what's their connection?

18:41.970 --> 18:43.169
Terrence King.

18:43.171 --> 18:45.689
They share a parole officer
named Dominic Galuska.

18:45.691 --> 18:47.441
Yeah, saw him
at the courthouse.

18:47.443 --> 18:50.360
Maybe I should pay
Mr. Galuska a visit,

18:50.362 --> 18:53.447
see if this is more
than just a coincidence.

18:54.682 --> 18:56.182
I know what you're gonna say.

18:56.184 --> 18:58.485
I give you an address,
and you promised me

18:58.487 --> 19:01.204
no one would get dead,
and what happens?

19:01.206 --> 19:04.040
In my defense, Mr. Garcia
didn't look both ways

19:04.042 --> 19:05.358
before crossing the street.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.111
How did you know
the dead guy's name?

19:08.113 --> 19:10.080
We couldn't find any ID on him.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.998
It was on his driver's license.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.001
You stole a dead guy's wallet?

19:15.003 --> 19:17.754
He tried to kill
Andrea Gutierrez last night,

19:17.756 --> 19:19.005
and he was going to try again.

19:19.007 --> 19:22.759
Garcia had just under,
what, 10 grand on him?

19:22.761 --> 19:24.928
My guess,
it's a payoff for a hit.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.563
Who'd want to kill her?

19:26.565 --> 19:28.148
I'm working on it.

19:28.150 --> 19:30.250
I can't pay you
this month, Galuska.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.518
If I don't get my cut,

19:31.520 --> 19:34.237
I bet I could find
a dozen parole violations,

19:34.239 --> 19:37.274
throw you back inside.

19:39.495 --> 19:40.944
That's 10%, okay?

19:40.946 --> 19:42.446
When I got you this job,

19:42.448 --> 19:44.397
our deal was
30% of your paycheck.

19:44.399 --> 19:46.833
Don't you cheap out on me, Lou.

19:46.835 --> 19:48.952
Hey, Dominic!

19:48.954 --> 19:51.905
Where's my money?

19:51.907 --> 19:53.373
Who do you think
you're talking to?

19:53.375 --> 19:55.375
I thought I was talking
to the guy who's shaking down

19:55.377 --> 19:58.628
his parolees
for their legit pay.

20:07.254 --> 20:08.638
See if you can find me

20:08.640 --> 20:11.925
a bottle of booze
in there, will you?

20:27.208 --> 20:29.242
- Thank you.
- 911, state your emergency.

20:29.244 --> 20:30.443
I'm Dominic Galuska,

20:30.445 --> 20:33.713
and I may be a danger
to myself and others.

20:45.343 --> 20:47.227
Wow, the old loft.

20:47.229 --> 20:52.131
Yeah, haven't been here
since the funeral.

20:52.133 --> 20:55.819
I thought you might
come back to it someday.

20:55.821 --> 20:58.522
I'm packing some stuff up
to send to storage.

20:58.524 --> 21:01.491
If there's anything that you're
interested in, let me know.

21:01.493 --> 21:04.828
Thanks.
You thinking about staying?

21:04.830 --> 21:08.999
No, I'm thinking about
selling the place.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.117
Never really
liked it much here.

21:11.119 --> 21:12.652
Oh.

21:12.654 --> 21:14.487
It's where he moved
after the divorce.

21:14.489 --> 21:20.260
Always seemed too big...
Expensive... vacant.

21:20.262 --> 21:22.345
Well, he worked a lot.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.214
Guess I can see
how you might think that.

21:24.216 --> 21:25.599
Sorry, I forgot to ask--

21:25.601 --> 21:28.435
How's the insurance
business going?

21:28.437 --> 21:30.637
Boring as ever, thank you.

21:30.639 --> 21:33.172
Have you had a chance
to go through everything?

21:33.174 --> 21:34.841
It turns out dad
was a bit of a pack rat.

21:34.843 --> 21:36.810
It looks like
half of it's mine.

21:36.812 --> 21:40.179
Projects, awards,
papers from school.

21:40.181 --> 21:42.115
Well, you always were
an outstanding student.

21:42.117 --> 21:44.618
Have you thought about
finishing your residency?

21:44.620 --> 21:45.902
No, got plenty of action

21:45.904 --> 21:48.038
around the world with MSF,
Red Cross.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.689
Didn't feel like
I was helping people.

21:49.691 --> 21:51.708
You're a doctor.
All you do is help people.

21:51.710 --> 21:55.295
I treat symptoms
of the disease after the fact,

21:55.297 --> 21:56.730
never the underlying cause.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.715
I want to really help people.

21:58.717 --> 22:03.202
I was just thinking how much
you sound like your father.

22:03.204 --> 22:04.220
Yeah.

22:04.222 --> 22:06.556
Any chance I can
convince you to stay?

22:06.558 --> 22:09.009
Sorry.

22:09.011 --> 22:12.395
Well, don't leave
without saying good-bye.

22:12.397 --> 22:15.932
I won't.

22:20.388 --> 22:22.906
You framed Galuska
for making a death threat

22:22.908 --> 22:24.357
against one of his parolees?

22:24.359 --> 22:25.592
You said you needed evidence.

22:25.594 --> 22:26.860
Not like that.

22:26.862 --> 22:28.328
If you don't wanna
interrogate him, Carter,

22:28.330 --> 22:30.063
I'd be happy to do it for you.

22:30.065 --> 22:32.365
He's already in the box.

22:32.367 --> 22:35.201
Good, we need to find out
if he's working with anyone.

22:35.203 --> 22:37.420
See if he's sent
anyone else after Andrea.

22:37.422 --> 22:39.522
I know how to do my job,
thank you.

22:39.524 --> 22:43.593
But I did find something
interesting about Galuska.

22:43.595 --> 22:46.046
Several of his parolees
that got sent back inside

22:46.048 --> 22:48.298
complained about him
setting them up.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.583
Said Galuska planted
evidence on them.

22:50.585 --> 22:52.102
What does he get out of it?

22:52.104 --> 22:53.436
I'm gonna find that out.

22:53.438 --> 22:57.307
In the meantime, can you try
not to break any more laws?

23:02.430 --> 23:05.231
Hello, Lionel, miss me?

23:05.233 --> 23:06.432
Yeah, like I miss a hangover.

23:06.434 --> 23:09.285
- I've got a job for you.
- This about Carter?

23:09.287 --> 23:11.121
Because she's still acting
all hinky.

23:11.123 --> 23:14.124
No, it's not Carter
I'm concerned about right now.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.408
It's someone else.

23:15.410 --> 23:17.827
All right, what's this job?

23:28.305 --> 23:29.289
John?

23:29.291 --> 23:30.289
Do we have an appointment?

23:30.291 --> 23:31.725
No, but I have a question.

23:31.727 --> 23:33.977
I was just assigned a new PO.

23:33.979 --> 23:35.729
He's being difficult.

23:35.731 --> 23:38.098
His name's Dominic Galuska.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.299
I know that guy.
Total jackass.

23:40.301 --> 23:41.901
He keeps searching
my apartment,

23:41.903 --> 23:44.354
and there's nothing to find,
but he keeps coming back.

23:44.356 --> 23:45.772
If he shows up again, call me.

23:45.774 --> 23:49.009
I'll be there,
anytime of the day or night.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.660
On the clock, of course.

23:50.662 --> 23:54.614
How's that site
working out for you?

23:54.616 --> 23:57.000
Ha...

23:57.002 --> 23:58.535
Uh...

23:58.537 --> 24:01.320
It's hard to find the right kind
of guy in my line of work.

24:01.322 --> 24:05.158
That seems odd, because
you're very attractive, smart...

24:05.160 --> 24:06.993
Let me stop you there, John.

24:06.995 --> 24:09.045
I don't date my clients
or ex-cons.

24:09.047 --> 24:10.130
Been there, done that.

24:10.132 --> 24:13.767
This is Andrea 2.0
you're looking at.

24:13.769 --> 24:15.018
Plus, I need your money.

24:15.020 --> 24:18.188
And I like my guys
not quite so...

24:18.190 --> 24:20.607
Better looking than me.

24:24.478 --> 24:27.513
Why did you stay in
the town where you grew up?

24:27.515 --> 24:29.532
I mean, why not start fresh?

24:29.534 --> 24:33.352
Because I'm not running away
from who I was.

24:33.354 --> 24:35.288
I was taught
it's okay to make mistakes,

24:35.290 --> 24:38.291
and I believe everyone
deserves a second chance.

24:43.464 --> 24:46.549
Threatening
a parolee's life, Dominic?

24:46.551 --> 24:48.301
This is some kind
of misunderstanding.

24:48.303 --> 24:50.136
Just a little depressed, huh?

24:50.138 --> 24:51.721
You got a tough job.

24:51.723 --> 24:55.041
From what I'm seeing here,
you're not very good at it.

24:55.043 --> 24:58.478
You got the worst recidivism
rate in your office.

24:58.480 --> 25:02.432
Kicked more guys back inside
last month than I did.

25:02.434 --> 25:04.100
Some were even saying
they were set up.

25:04.102 --> 25:07.654
You know a criminal's motto,
Detective, "I didn't do it."

25:07.656 --> 25:09.889
You're doing
a public service, Mr. Galuska.

25:09.891 --> 25:13.093
Hard work, crap pay.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.945
Which is why it's interesting
you drive such a nice truck.

25:15.947 --> 25:18.081
My aunt passed away
a couple of months ago.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.616
Left me some money.

25:19.618 --> 25:20.900
Why do you care?

25:20.902 --> 25:23.670
I care when people get hurt.

25:23.672 --> 25:27.257
Like your parolee,
Alonso Garcia.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.909
Guy got run over in red hook
this afternoon.

25:29.911 --> 25:32.578
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

25:32.580 --> 25:33.913
Did you know Mr. Garcia

25:33.915 --> 25:36.415
tried to kill
Andrea Gutierrez two nights ago?

25:36.417 --> 25:40.253
Like I said, couldn't happen
to a nicer guy.

25:40.255 --> 25:43.940
I can't, for the life of me,
figure out what kind of grudge

25:43.942 --> 25:48.862
Alonso Garcia would have against
Ms. Gutierrez, can you?

25:48.864 --> 25:52.532
I think I'm ready
for my lawyer now.

25:52.534 --> 25:53.700
Yeah.

26:01.275 --> 26:02.792
How'd it go?

26:02.794 --> 26:05.495
I'm sorry, got a big
goose egg on this one.

26:05.497 --> 26:07.046
Galuska walked.

26:07.048 --> 26:08.798
Oh, no, you did great, Carter.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.717
Because while you two
were having a chat,

26:10.719 --> 26:12.618
I got into his apartment,

26:12.620 --> 26:15.171
borrowed his computer.

26:15.173 --> 26:17.473
You broke into his apartment?

26:17.475 --> 26:19.458
You said you couldn't
do anything illegal.

26:19.460 --> 26:23.096
You didn't say
anything about me.

26:24.965 --> 26:26.799
Mr. Galuska should know
better than to protect

26:26.801 --> 26:29.519
his important files
with his birth date.

26:29.521 --> 26:32.906
That's a hell of a lot of
money in the bank for a man

26:32.908 --> 26:34.941
who makes less than
50 grand a year.

26:34.943 --> 26:36.910
Each deposit coincides
with when he sent

26:36.912 --> 26:38.611
one of his parolees
back to prison.

26:38.613 --> 26:40.813
He's getting kickbacks
from somewhere or someone.

26:40.815 --> 26:41.915
Prisons are big business.

26:41.917 --> 26:44.250
The more inmates,
the more funding.

26:44.252 --> 26:48.588
Mr. Galuska took out
exactly $9,900

26:48.590 --> 26:50.156
from his savings account
three days ago.

26:50.158 --> 26:52.425
Anything over 10,000
gets flagged by the IRS.

26:52.427 --> 26:54.327
He paid Alonso Garcia
to kill Andrea.

26:54.329 --> 26:55.494
That's not the only withdrawal.

26:55.496 --> 26:56.846
There's another one
in the same amount

26:56.848 --> 26:57.981
just last night.

26:57.983 --> 26:59.048
That means--

26:59.050 --> 27:01.718
He hired someone else
to finish the job.

27:25.292 --> 27:26.459
John!

27:40.341 --> 27:41.707
John, what is going on?

27:41.709 --> 27:45.711
I don't need your services
anymore, Andrea.

27:45.713 --> 27:48.898
But I think
you're gonna need mine.

27:56.204 --> 27:58.822
Mr. Reese, are you
at the safe house yet?

27:58.824 --> 28:01.241
Heading there now.

28:02.627 --> 28:05.462
Okay, what the hell?!

28:05.464 --> 28:06.847
You're in danger, Andrea.

28:06.849 --> 28:08.832
Um, you think?
Who was the guy with the gun,

28:08.834 --> 28:10.334
and who are you,
because your back

28:10.336 --> 28:12.503
seemed just fine when you
went ninja on that guy.

28:12.505 --> 28:14.838
I'm like you-- I give people
second chances.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.590
So you were never in jail?

28:16.592 --> 28:17.841
Not in this country.

28:17.843 --> 28:18.976
Excuse me.

28:18.978 --> 28:20.143
Mr. Reese?

28:20.145 --> 28:21.512
An arrest report just came in

28:21.514 --> 28:24.631
for the gentleman you
apprehended in the law library.

28:24.633 --> 28:26.517
His name is Wendell Lentz,

28:26.519 --> 28:29.903
and I've confirmed that he's one
of Dominic Galuska's parolees.

28:29.905 --> 28:32.105
Okay, we need to make sure
Galuska doesn't have any more

28:32.107 --> 28:33.824
killers out there
looking for Andrea.

28:33.826 --> 28:37.277
What did I do?

28:37.279 --> 28:39.696
Galuska's getting money from
someone to set up his ex-cons

28:39.698 --> 28:41.081
and send them back to prison.

28:41.083 --> 28:43.650
You kicked a hornet's nest
with Terrence's case.

28:43.652 --> 28:46.653
Galuska may have planted
those drugs in his home.

28:46.655 --> 28:47.921
Oh, my God.

28:47.923 --> 28:52.009
That means Terrence
is actually innocent.

28:52.011 --> 28:53.326
You weren't sure?

28:53.328 --> 28:54.661
I wanted to be.

28:54.663 --> 28:57.464
Terrence was given a drug test
the night he was arrested,

28:57.466 --> 29:00.350
and it came back negative.

29:00.352 --> 29:01.969
Galuska and the department
of corrections

29:01.971 --> 29:03.937
conveniently misplaced it.

29:03.939 --> 29:05.689
I never got a copy
of the report.

29:05.691 --> 29:07.190
A little more digging,
you'd also have found

29:07.192 --> 29:09.026
all the complaints
filed against him.

29:09.028 --> 29:13.179
Parolees who said
Galuska set them up.

29:13.181 --> 29:14.982
- I need to tell Terrence.
- You need to stay here

29:14.984 --> 29:17.868
until I find out who else
he may have hired to kill you

29:17.870 --> 29:20.954
and who Galuska's working for.

29:20.956 --> 29:22.205
Stay here, lock the doors,

29:22.207 --> 29:24.408
and don't open them for anyone.

29:24.410 --> 29:26.660
I take it you know
how to use this?

29:26.662 --> 29:30.196
You grow up where I did, you
know how to handle yourself.

29:43.761 --> 29:45.512
Hmm.

29:45.514 --> 29:48.214
You're getting better at
ditching your tail.

29:48.216 --> 29:51.852
Maybe you got a knack
for breaking the law.

29:51.854 --> 29:54.571
I've been going back
through Galuska's files

29:54.573 --> 29:55.772
and found a pattern.

29:55.774 --> 29:58.558
In the past year,
all the parolees

29:58.560 --> 30:00.911
he's busted
were single parents.

30:00.913 --> 30:03.747
Which means their kids
end up in foster care.

30:06.334 --> 30:08.251
Galuska wasn't getting
paid for the parolees.

30:08.253 --> 30:10.120
He was getting
paid for their kids.

30:10.122 --> 30:12.956
Each child is worth
about 800 bucks a month.

30:12.958 --> 30:15.792
Galuska's gotta be working
with someone at DFS.

30:15.794 --> 30:17.744
Well, DFS is a big agency.

30:17.746 --> 30:20.430
I'm gonna have a talk
with Mary and Paul Kinsey--

30:20.432 --> 30:23.600
The foster parents looking after
Terrence King's kid.

30:23.602 --> 30:26.853
You're good at this, Carter.

30:26.855 --> 30:28.188
It's my job.

30:28.190 --> 30:32.025
And I didn't even have to shoot
anyone to do it.

30:35.279 --> 30:37.481
I just have a few questions,
Mr. and Mrs. Kinsey.

30:37.483 --> 30:39.733
I promise not to take up
too much of your time.

30:39.735 --> 30:41.034
Something wrong?

30:41.036 --> 30:42.736
I certainly hope not, ma'am.

30:42.738 --> 30:47.324
I see here you have six foster
children under you care.

30:47.326 --> 30:49.710
- Is that still correct?
- It is, yes.

30:49.712 --> 30:53.313
Okay, and, uh, Jacob King
is one of those kids?

30:53.315 --> 30:55.465
This is about Jacob?

30:55.467 --> 30:59.536
He misses his dad, but...
He's adjusting just fine.

30:59.538 --> 31:01.121
Do you, either of you,

31:01.123 --> 31:04.124
know a man
named Dominic Galuska?

31:04.126 --> 31:06.226
No, who's that?

31:06.228 --> 31:08.011
What about Gloria Copeland?

31:08.013 --> 31:13.183
She's the head of foster
placement at DFS.

31:13.185 --> 31:17.137
Where do all six of the children
that are under your care sleep?

31:17.139 --> 31:21.191
Because it looks to me...

31:21.193 --> 31:23.143
You live in
a one-bedroom apartment.

31:23.145 --> 31:27.531
Not much space
for six kids and two adults.

31:31.986 --> 31:34.871
Okay, you tell me the truth now,
or I arrest both of you

31:34.873 --> 31:38.592
for interfering with
a criminal investigation.

31:42.430 --> 31:45.599
Jacob's the only child
living with us right now.

31:46.801 --> 31:50.437
So the others on the list,
Rebecca Johnson, Trey White...

31:50.439 --> 31:52.522
Rebecca ran away months ago.

31:52.524 --> 31:57.194
Trey White and the other
children, they...

31:57.196 --> 32:00.147
The others don't exist.

32:02.316 --> 32:05.202
But I bet you're still getting
paid for all of them.

32:05.204 --> 32:06.286
Enough, Paul.

32:06.288 --> 32:07.871
You shut your mouth.

32:12.493 --> 32:16.213
Galuska's not smart enough
to pull this off on his own.

32:16.215 --> 32:18.465
So he had to have
a contact at DFS,

32:18.467 --> 32:22.969
and you are going to tell me
who that person is.

32:22.971 --> 32:25.371
We want a lawyer.

32:25.373 --> 32:27.474
And our phone call.

32:29.545 --> 32:31.311
Don't go anywhere.

32:34.899 --> 32:36.382
Who is this?

32:36.384 --> 32:38.435
You know who, Detective.

32:38.437 --> 32:41.071
I want you to give the Kinseys
their phone call.

32:41.073 --> 32:42.555
You are interrupting me

32:42.557 --> 32:44.524
in the middle
of an interrogation.

32:44.526 --> 32:46.693
Sounded like the end of
an interrogation to me.

32:46.695 --> 32:49.279
They asked for their lawyer.

32:49.281 --> 32:51.281
How would you know that?

32:51.283 --> 32:53.416
Are you bugging my phone?

32:53.418 --> 32:55.952
I want you to give the Kinseys
their phone call.

32:55.954 --> 32:58.922
Not until I find out
who their contact at DFS is.

32:58.924 --> 33:01.708
We think we already know
who that person is, Detective.

33:01.710 --> 33:05.045
We've checked the DFS filings
for the last six parolees

33:05.047 --> 33:07.130
that Galuska busted.

33:07.132 --> 33:10.133
The signatures on all six
belong to one woman,

33:10.135 --> 33:11.434
Gloria Copeland.

33:11.436 --> 33:14.104
Yeah, but that's not enough
evidence to arrest her.

33:14.106 --> 33:15.922
DFS is a mountain of paperwork.

33:15.924 --> 33:17.607
It'd take months
to sort through it all,

33:17.609 --> 33:19.259
and if the Kinseys tip her off,

33:19.261 --> 33:21.094
Copeland's only gonna
destroy the evidence.

33:21.096 --> 33:25.065
That's exactly what
we want her to do.

33:25.067 --> 33:27.200
If we're gonna work
together, Detective,

33:27.202 --> 33:29.786
a little bit of trust
is in order.

33:38.279 --> 33:41.281
Finch, are you in?

33:41.283 --> 33:42.448
Just.

33:44.118 --> 33:45.769
Well, you need to move fast.

33:45.771 --> 33:48.471
Thanks for that newsflash,
Mr. Reese.

33:48.473 --> 33:51.141
Here I was planning
to move at a sloth-like pace

33:51.143 --> 33:53.176
and get myself captured.

34:09.025 --> 34:12.978
The scanner's installed,
Mr. Reese.

34:12.981 --> 34:14.748
Was that fast enough for you?

34:17.702 --> 34:18.918
Hello?

34:18.920 --> 34:20.036
Will you accept a collect call

34:20.038 --> 34:22.405
from Metropolitan
Detention Center, Brooklyn,

34:22.407 --> 34:24.174
on behalf of Terrence?

34:24.176 --> 34:26.793
Yes, of course.

34:26.795 --> 34:27.893
Terrence, what's wrong?

34:27.896 --> 34:29.713
They're moving me to Attica
tomorrow.

34:29.715 --> 34:30.663
What?!

34:30.665 --> 34:32.098
Why?
I don't know.

34:32.100 --> 34:35.335
But look, that's not
a detention facility.

34:35.337 --> 34:37.853
That's maximum security...

34:37.856 --> 34:40.306
And I can't make it in there.

34:40.309 --> 34:42.359
Look, I'm just gonna file an
injunction to stop the transfer.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.610
We're gonna need some help
convincing a judge.

34:44.612 --> 34:45.695
Okay, all right.

34:45.697 --> 34:48.215
I'm gonna take care of this,
okay, T?

34:48.217 --> 34:50.283
Right.

34:55.956 --> 34:57.290
We were right.

34:57.292 --> 35:00.026
The Kinseys must have contacted
Gloria Copeland.

35:00.028 --> 35:01.745
She's begun shredding
the documents.

35:01.747 --> 35:03.546
I'm getting the scans now.

35:03.548 --> 35:05.665
Every time Dominic Galuska

35:05.667 --> 35:08.034
sends one of his
parolees back to prison,

35:08.036 --> 35:10.003
Ms. Copeland uses
the foster care paperwork

35:10.005 --> 35:13.539
to hide the kids
she's fabricated.

35:13.541 --> 35:14.925
She makes it look like
the parolees

35:14.927 --> 35:16.977
have more kids
than they actually do.

35:16.979 --> 35:20.263
This scam must be worth
upwards of $1/4 million a month.

35:20.265 --> 35:22.732
We got a problem then, Finch.

35:24.101 --> 35:27.020
Gloria Copeland
left work early.

35:27.022 --> 35:28.554
She isn't the one
shredding the documents.

35:28.556 --> 35:31.775
Galuska's got a different
contact at DFS.

35:37.531 --> 35:39.749
Andrea, wh-- what
are you doing here?

35:39.751 --> 35:44.204
Terrence is being transferred
to Attica in the morning.

35:44.206 --> 35:46.572
Um, what do you want me
to do about it?

35:46.574 --> 35:48.241
Call his case worker, Chris.

35:48.243 --> 35:50.176
Tell her to contact the judge
who made the order.

35:50.178 --> 35:53.546
The transfer's not in the best
interest of the child.

35:56.133 --> 35:58.351
I can't do that.

35:59.420 --> 36:01.438
What's wrong with you?
Why not?

36:01.440 --> 36:04.858
Because I'm the one that
asked the judge to move him.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.311
You're working with Galuska.

36:12.266 --> 36:15.785
You know the shame of it, Andi?

36:15.787 --> 36:17.904
Turns out you're actually
a pretty good lawyer.

36:17.906 --> 36:21.958
Not that anyone's
ever gonna know it.

36:30.670 --> 36:33.155
Mr. Reese, I'm running
a handwriting analysis

36:33.157 --> 36:36.141
on the signatures of Gloria
Copeland and Chris Scollard.

36:36.143 --> 36:38.694
The Rs in both names
are identical.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.863
He forged her signature.

36:40.865 --> 36:44.149
Gloria Copeland had no idea
what was going on.

36:59.466 --> 37:01.500
Why would you do this, Chris?

37:01.502 --> 37:03.552
How could you betray
all those families?

37:04.704 --> 37:06.972
Those kids were better off
with their foster families

37:06.974 --> 37:08.674
than they ever were
with their convict parents.

37:08.676 --> 37:11.810
Terrence's son gave him
a reason to stay clean.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.846
He got a job, a life.

37:13.848 --> 37:17.316
Who are you to take away their
chance at being a family?

37:17.318 --> 37:20.185
I admire that
bleeding heart of yours.

37:20.187 --> 37:22.905
I'd rather it bleed
than stop beating altogether.

38:06.766 --> 38:07.783
He's getting away.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.785
No, he's not.

38:13.656 --> 38:15.207
NYPD. Turn around.

38:15.209 --> 38:17.159
Drop your weapon.

38:17.161 --> 38:18.327
Drop it!

38:49.809 --> 38:51.493
Whoa, come here, buddy.

38:54.497 --> 38:56.865
Oh, I missed you, man.

38:56.867 --> 38:58.483
I missed you so much.

38:58.485 --> 39:00.119
Um, I'll be right back.

39:00.121 --> 39:02.320
Yeah, yeah.

39:02.322 --> 39:04.957
I read about your
settlement with the State.

39:04.959 --> 39:08.544
Wrongful imprisonment,
defamation of character--

39:08.546 --> 39:10.212
Don't forget violation
of civil rights

39:10.214 --> 39:11.663
and malicious prosecution.

39:11.665 --> 39:16.935
You get 30% of $10 million.
Not bad.

39:16.937 --> 39:19.321
Maybe you can stop sneaking
into NYU's library.

39:19.323 --> 39:21.607
I think I'm gonna start
with a new pair of shoes.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.025
Besides, I like it in there.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.443
Has a good vibe.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.278
Even after
you almost go killed?

39:26.280 --> 39:32.184
Well, I had you and your
complicated job to save me.

39:32.186 --> 39:35.520
You ever think of having
a less hazardous profession

39:35.522 --> 39:37.823
like mountain climbing
or bear wrestling?

39:37.825 --> 39:39.792
I mean, is it really
worth risking your life

39:39.794 --> 39:41.193
for people you don't know?

39:41.195 --> 39:45.414
You're not the only one
who believes in second chances.

39:48.635 --> 39:50.252
Thank you.

39:58.728 --> 40:00.896
Hey, Uncle Harold.

40:00.898 --> 40:04.900
When you called, I assumed it
was going to be good-bye again.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.102
No, I'm not gonna
sell the place.

40:07.104 --> 40:08.553
Not right away, anyway.

40:08.555 --> 40:10.572
Are you taking up
your residency again?

40:10.574 --> 40:11.907
No.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.492
I'm done patching people up,

40:13.494 --> 40:17.112
and I wanna find out
more about my dad.

40:17.114 --> 40:18.664
Look at this.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.616
This was the day
you got into med school.

40:20.618 --> 40:22.000
He was so proud of you.

40:22.002 --> 40:23.669
Always was.

40:25.088 --> 40:26.238
Going through his things,

40:26.240 --> 40:28.507
I realize how little
I really knew him.

40:28.509 --> 40:31.343
I think most fathers
are a mystery to their sons.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.378
Well, most sons
don't have the advantage

40:33.380 --> 40:37.049
of reading
the unauthorized biography.

40:37.051 --> 40:40.185
Or all this.

40:41.104 --> 40:42.921
It's from the audit
the lawyers did

40:42.923 --> 40:46.258
when he left me
his half of the company.

40:46.260 --> 40:48.443
Now, most of it
I don't understand.

40:48.445 --> 40:51.263
I get lost when it comes to
computers, like you, right?

40:51.265 --> 40:53.282
Right.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.267
But, there are some things
I do understand.

40:55.269 --> 40:57.569
Inconsistencies like...
Did you know

40:57.571 --> 41:02.040
that he shut down IFT
for nearly seven years?

41:02.042 --> 41:04.109
Yes, I knew that
he downsized a bit.

41:04.111 --> 41:06.078
Well, he gave
all his employees severance

41:06.080 --> 41:07.445
and sent them packing.

41:07.447 --> 41:09.248
Why would he do that?

41:09.250 --> 41:12.417
And, look, whatever it was
that he was working on,

41:12.419 --> 41:14.920
he sold it to the government
for a dollar.

41:14.922 --> 41:18.473
So that means it was either
something worthless...

41:18.475 --> 41:22.127
Or priceless.

41:22.129 --> 41:24.146
Did he ever
talk to you about it?

41:24.148 --> 41:28.233
I mean, you were
his closest friend.

41:28.235 --> 41:30.102
No, he never did.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.768
Where have you been, Finch?

42:02.770 --> 42:05.387
I won't be back
in the office today.

42:05.389 --> 42:08.056
Maybe you should take the rest
of the day off as well.

42:08.058 --> 42:09.675
You want to talk about it?

42:09.677 --> 42:11.560
Not particularly.

42:11.562 --> 42:13.445
But you admit
there is something going on,

42:13.447 --> 42:16.982
something
that you're worried about.

42:16.984 --> 42:18.483
That makes me worried.

42:18.485 --> 42:20.202
Well, you needn't, Mr. Reese.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.738
I hope you understand
that there are certain things

42:22.740 --> 42:25.324
that I can't tell you.

42:25.326 --> 42:28.393
Oh, I understand
completely, Finch.

42:36.970 --> 42:38.337
How's it going, Lionel?

42:38.339 --> 42:40.639
I'm on that new assignment
you gave me.

42:40.641 --> 42:43.725
I gotta say, I should at least
be getting cab fare for this.

42:43.727 --> 42:45.594
This job ending any time soon?

42:45.596 --> 42:48.546
As soon as I get some answers.
