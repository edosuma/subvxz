you will not believe            

00:09.373 --> 00:10.741
      what happened to me.      

00:10.775 --> 00:13.443
             I made a right-hand
             turn onto Boyleston

00:13.477 --> 00:16.113
             and ran right into 
             this stupid parade.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.816
          Then my car backfired,
          and scared the tar

and ran away,

in blue sequins ran after them

and the car                     

00:36.600 --> 00:38.568
ran right in front              
of this elephant,               

00:38.602 --> 00:40.370
the elephant reared up,         

00:40.405 --> 00:43.706

    who could sing the part.    

05:05.469 --> 05:07.304
So, what's this, uh, play       
    you tried out for?

     Well, it's a brand-new one.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.406
    It's called <i>Authors in Hell.</i>

05:10.441 --> 05:12.408
              I'm hoping to play
              either Mark Twain,

        one of the guys from the
        Algonquin Round Table   

05:15.079 --> 05:16.479

05:18.449 --> 05:19.716
                But heck, I'd   
                be just as happy

        tried out so many times,

05:53.501 --> 05:55.068
                  and I've never
                  gotten a part.

05:55.103 --> 05:57.604
         Maybe I'm just wasting 
         my time in the theater.

05:57.639 --> 05:59.806
Come on, Woody,                 
don't give up so easily.        

05:59.841 --> 06:01.975
Once upon a time,               
there was a young man           

06:02.010 --> 06:04.645
named Grif Palmer               
who also auditioned             

06:04.679 --> 06:07.114
for many a role                 
that he didn't get.

loneliness                      
is highly underrated.           

18:12.705 --> 18:15.558
It's one of the few things left 
  that you can still do alone.  

18:15.592 --> 18:17.460
        Did Mark Twain say that?

18:17.494 --> 18:19.912
No, but I'm kind of running out 
of his material.                

18:21.714 --> 18:23.833
             There's something  
             I want to give you.

18:23.867 --> 18:25.684
             It's Lloyd's watch.

18:25.718 --> 18:26.785
Oh.                             

18:26.820 --> 18:29.155
          I want you to have it.

18:29.189 --> 18:31.874
No, I couldn't.                 
                 Oh, please.    

18:31.908 --> 18:34.310
Ah, gee, thanks, Mary.          

18:34.344 --> 18:36.094
                    ( <i>chuckles</i> )

18:36.129 --> 18:37.229
Would you excuse me             
for a second?                   

18:37.264 --> 18:38.664
                    Sure.       

18:39.766 --> 18:41.467
Oh, wait.                       

18:41.501 --> 18:45.737
    I just want to memorize     
the way you look in this light. 

18:47.057 --> 18:48.907
         ( <i>dreamily</i> ):          
        Go ahead.               

18:54.381 --> 18:55.881
                Sam, I don't    
                know what to do.

18:55.915 --> 18:57.950
            Now she's memorizing
            the way I look      

18:57.985 --> 18:59.785
                 in different   
                 kinds of light.

18:59.819 --> 19:01.620
     Oh, I don't know, Woody.   
     Women do that all the time.

19:01.655 --> 19:03.956
    Yeah, and she gave me       
    her dead husband's watch.   

19:07.160 --> 19:09.996
    You could do a lot worse.   

19:11.498 --> 19:13.799
Listen,                         
you got to end this.            

19:13.834 --> 19:15.234
Right now, go on.               

19:15.268 --> 19:16.368
            I don't know how.   

19:16.402 --> 19:18.104
             You know, I-I can't
             stand the thought  

19:18.138 --> 19:19.571
            of hurting          
            somebody's feelings.

19:19.606 --> 19:20.840
    I know.                     

19:20.874 --> 19:22.308
         Carla, you've been     
         dumped a million times.

19:22.343 --> 19:23.643
What's the best                 
way to do it?                   

19:25.646 --> 19:28.914
You know, the only reason       
I'm not cleaning your clock     

19:28.948 --> 19:31.517
is because you remind me        
of Jed Clampett.                

19:33.286 --> 19:34.854
Listen,                         
you are not dumping her.        

19:34.888 --> 19:36.155
You're leveling with her.       

19:36.189 --> 19:38.357
Now, it's-it's the only         
honest thing to do.             

19:38.391 --> 19:40.492
Now, go on,                     
be a man. Do it.                

19:41.945 --> 19:43.545
              You're right, Sam.

19:43.580 --> 19:46.148
              It's time I stood 
              on my own two feet

19:46.182 --> 19:48.283
        and did what's right.   
Right.                          

19:48.318 --> 19:50.920
          Will you come with me?

19:50.954 --> 19:52.771
This is something               
you got to do by yourself.      

19:52.805 --> 19:53.505
                    I can't.    

19:53.540 --> 19:55.007
Well, I-I'm not                 
gonna do it, Woody.

19:56.610 --> 19:57.593

                 this by myself.

19:57.711 --> 19:58.777
          You've got to help me.

All right, all right.           

20:00.046 --> 20:01.947
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.           
                    Thank you.  

20:01.981 --> 20:04.250
          You believe           
    I'm just an understudy?     

20:09.239 --> 20:11.107
                Um, Mary,       
        Yes.                    

20:11.141 --> 20:13.609
      Woody wants to tell       
         you something.         

20:15.112 --> 20:17.296
          Well, um...           

20:17.330 --> 20:19.565
        Mary, you see...        

20:19.599 --> 20:21.466
             Uh...              

20:21.501 --> 20:24.153
I mean, you know,               
uh, how...                      

20:24.187 --> 20:26.222
    I don't suppose there's     
any chance you understand       

20:26.256 --> 20:27.923
  what I'm talking about yet.   

20:27.957 --> 20:30.075
                 Actually, I do.

20:30.110 --> 20:34.046
        Let me explain something
        to you, Woody.          

20:34.080 --> 20:38.451
        I'm a very lonely woman 
        since I lost my husband.

20:38.485 --> 20:40.686
                 My family lives
                 out of state.  

20:40.721 --> 20:42.772
                  I never see my
                  grandchildren,

20:42.806 --> 20:44.440
          and most of my friends

20:44.474 --> 20:46.375
                have moved or   
                passed away.    

20:46.410 --> 20:49.712
            Seems my days are   
            so hard to fill.    

20:49.746 --> 20:51.714
                  I swear, there
                  are mornings  

20:51.748 --> 20:54.483
             when it didn't     
             seem worthwhile    
             getting out of bed.

20:54.518 --> 20:57.086
         A-And then I met you...
Stop. Stop.                     

20:57.120 --> 20:58.620
Will you marry me?              

21:02.308 --> 21:04.977
                    Heavens, no.

21:05.011 --> 21:07.313
    I'm three times your age.   

21:07.347 --> 21:09.548
You know that I'm young?        

21:09.583 --> 21:12.801
Well, Woody, I may be old,      
      but I'm not stupid.       

21:15.656 --> 21:17.823
      Well, why didn't you      
    ever tell me this?          

21:17.857 --> 21:19.741
                Well, I enjoyed 
                your company so.

21:19.776 --> 21:22.144
              And besides, every
              time I wanted to, 

21:22.179 --> 21:26.014
            you started quoting 
            "The Jumping Frog   
            of Calaveras County"

21:27.517 --> 21:29.769
  Now, I hope you're not upset  
            with me.            

21:29.803 --> 21:30.870
      Oh, are you kidding?      

21:30.904 --> 21:32.938
         I'm just glad          
I didn't have to dump you.

        ( <i>laughs</i> )              

21:33.807 --> 21:35.874
      And besides, you had      
such fun playing the part,      

21:35.909 --> 21:37.576
 and you were quite excellent.  

21:37.611 --> 21:39.762
    You sure you don't          
    want to marry me?           

21:39.796 --> 21:41.079
                  ( <i>laughing</i> ): 
                  Ah, no, Woody.

my grandma?

                a favorite aunt.

21:45.918 --> 21:48.354
It's a deal.

My birthday is July 23rd.       

21:52.442 --> 21:55.277
      I just gave you the watch.

By the way,                     

21:58.598 --> 22:01.800
we're still on                  
for pot roast on Saturday.

     in a really weird way,

        didn't it?              

22:15.665 --> 22:16.682
                            Huh?

Yeah. I'm still                 
a little depressed.
