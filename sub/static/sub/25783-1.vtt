09:22.792 --> 09:24.667
He needs to sell
his company.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.209

- Hi, sir. I'm Andrew,
your executive assistant.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.959
- You got something
stuck in your eye?
- No, sir. It's a twitch.

It goes away after
I get to know my boss
for a few months.

09:51.168 --> 09:53.459
- I've had a couple.
- OK, cool.

09:53.542 --> 09:56.376
- Well, you just
call me Charles.

09:56.459 --> 09:59.750

where do you want your desk
and sofa?

09:59.834 --> 10:02.084
Ah! OK, so I'm thinkin'

10:02.168 --> 10:04.376
we push the desk
up against the window,

10:04.459 --> 10:06.334
we move the couch
over against the wall,

10:06.418 --> 10:09.001
with the coffee table
and armchairs facing in.

10:09.084 --> 10:11.251
Oo-wee. You're goin' good now.
Something wrong?

10:11.334 --> 10:13.709
It's just not
very feng shui your way.

10:13.792 --> 10:16.750
Besides, I thought
you'd want it a little bit
different than Les.

10:16.834 --> 10:18.625
He had it arranged
that way?

10:18.709 --> 10:21.334
- Why didn't you
speak up and say so?
- ( knock on door )

10:21.418 --> 10:22.917
Sorry to interrupt.

10:23.001 --> 10:25.001
- Mr. Thompson.
How ya doin'?
- I'm good.

10:25.084 --> 10:27.792
So, what are you planning
with the 300 or so people

10:27.876 --> 10:29.959
- who work for you now?
- 300. Wow.

10:30.042 --> 10:31.876
I didn't realize
there were so many people.

10:31.959 --> 10:34.709
Oh, yeah. You have everyone
from administration,
communications,

10:34.792 --> 10:36.334
community affairs
and engagement,

10:36.418 --> 10:37.876
consumer sales
and marketing,

10:37.959 --> 10:39.126
data analytics--

10:39.209 --> 10:40.792
Andrew. I got it.
Everyone.

10:40.876 --> 10:42.418
Is this overwhelming for you?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.792
'Cause you seem like
you're a little overwhelmed.

10:44.876 --> 10:47.334
- No. No, sir.
- Good. Because basically,

10:47.418 --> 10:49.251
everyone that works
in this building

10:49.334 --> 10:50.667
and in this organization
in general,

10:50.750 --> 10:52.418
they work for you now,
Charles.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.418
- Except you, sir.
- Yeah.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.750
In my experience,

10:55.834 --> 10:57.750
it's best not
to keep people in limbo.

10:57.834 --> 11:00.376
You know, just cut
the dead weight fast.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.293
Maybe they'll find
another job.

11:02.376 --> 11:03.750
Yeah?

11:03.834 --> 11:05.168
Call me if you need me.

11:07.084 --> 11:10.001
Joe: Whoever says they miss
sleeping in their own beds
when they're away,

11:10.084 --> 11:12.917
never slept in
a fuckin' five-star hotel.

11:13.001 --> 11:15.500
Don't you love being
on the road together?

11:15.584 --> 11:18.126
Huh? Me and you?
Where we goin' next?

11:18.209 --> 11:20.792
- ( phone chiming )
- Someplace romantic
like the Maldives?

11:20.876 --> 11:22.418
Take that if
the answer's yes!

11:22.500 --> 11:24.168
- Yes!
- Hey, buddy.

11:24.251 --> 11:27.334
Brother. How's the Left Coast?
It's pissin' rain out here.

11:27.418 --> 11:30.917
The last time I was in L.A.,
someone slipped me a Mickey
at the ESPYs.

11:31.001 --> 11:32.625
I'm not even gonna tell you
whose bed I woke up in,

11:32.709 --> 11:35.001
but they looked
a helluva lot
like Bill Cosby.

11:35.084 --> 11:38.042
Sure as hell ain't nothin'
like good ol' Miami,
where people tell you

11:38.126 --> 11:40.667
they're gonna
take advantage of you
before they even do it.

11:40.750 --> 11:44.293
While you're out there
suffering, I need you
to do something for me.

11:44.376 --> 11:46.959
- What do you got?
- There's this kid
I need you to check out.

11:47.042 --> 11:48.750
He's the top quarterback
in the country.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.209
The kid out of Stanford,
right? Arm like a cannon?

11:51.293 --> 11:53.876
No, no, no. Not college.
High school.

11:53.959 --> 11:56.709
- Shit.
- His mom's an old friend
of the family.

11:56.792 --> 11:59.251
They just need some guidance,
that's all. Nothing shady.

11:59.334 --> 12:01.042
I don't like the optics
of this one bit.

12:01.126 --> 12:02.625
When has that ever
stopped you before?

12:02.709 --> 12:04.126
It's not about you.

12:04.209 --> 12:06.334
Everybody with a bag of cash
is talking to this kid.

12:06.418 --> 12:08.709
Just do it for me
and give them a call
while you're out there.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.500
- Can you?
- Only for you.

12:10.584 --> 12:12.376
You're the best.
Thank you, brother.

12:12.459 --> 12:13.625
I miss you.

12:13.709 --> 12:15.750
- What's this?
- Got us something special

12:15.834 --> 12:18.042
so we could roll in style
while we were here.

12:18.126 --> 12:20.209
- Wow.
- Hey, am I crazy,

12:20.293 --> 12:23.209
or are their palm trees
greener than ours?

12:23.293 --> 12:25.418
Nah, they're just thirstier.

Hi! Nice to
see you both again.

12:52.001 --> 12:54.500
I think that I am starting
to get a feel

12:54.584 --> 12:55.917
for what you guys like.

12:56.001 --> 12:57.459
I like her!

12:57.542 --> 13:00.500
Oh, baby,
so sweet.
Isn't he?

13:00.584 --> 13:03.667
He sure is.
Maybe one day soon
I'll find a man just like him.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.084
Bitch, just open the door
already.

- Don't get me involved.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.625
Nancy:
So, is it really true

13:13.709 --> 13:14.959
that you're retired?

13:15.042 --> 13:17.001
TTD: We haven't
decided that yet.

13:17.084 --> 13:19.042
But like I said before,
and I'll say it again,

13:19.126 --> 13:21.959
I am retired, officially,
but the real blessing is,

13:22.042 --> 13:24.334
I get to spend time
with my daughter
and her beautiful mother.

13:24.418 --> 13:25.917
We might go meet
with the Chargers.

13:26.001 --> 13:27.625
No, we ain't
meetin' with the Chargers.

13:27.709 --> 13:28.959
Shut the fuck up, T.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.376
Well, I really liked
watching you play.

13:31.459 --> 13:34.168
Seriously,
you need to stop that
before you get us all killed.

13:34.251 --> 13:35.542
Amber don't fuck around.

13:35.625 --> 13:37.376
( phone ringing )

13:39.750 --> 13:43.168
It has his-and-her bathrooms
and his-and-her closets.

13:43.251 --> 13:45.750
Oak and cedar.
Hermes orange
in the men's,

13:45.834 --> 13:46.792
Chanel pink
in the women's.

13:46.876 --> 13:48.625
Whatever you want to do, baby.

13:48.709 --> 13:51.750
Like they say,
"Happy baby mama,
happy life," right?

13:51.834 --> 13:53.792
It's "Happy wife,
happy life," baby.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.792
- Is it? Semantics.
- Yes.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.168
OK, you know what?

13:57.251 --> 13:58.792
Maybe you should
show me where the kitchen is

13:58.876 --> 14:00.376
since I'm gonna be the one
doing most of the cooking.

14:00.459 --> 14:02.168
It's like a 24 hour-a-day job.

14:02.251 --> 14:03.917
Baby Serene can wake up
at any time,

14:04.001 --> 14:06.042
and I gotta fry up
some shit, y'know?

14:06.126 --> 14:08.709
- ( door closes )
- OK.
- Mm-hmm.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.625
Let's take it
to a window.

14:10.709 --> 14:12.667
- Oh, you're so crazy.
- Yeah. Arr!

14:12.750 --> 14:15.500
Only way I can tell
if I like the house.

14:15.584 --> 14:17.834
Let's give it our blessing.

14:17.917 --> 14:19.209

Somehow I was expecting
just a little bit more.

14:47.584 --> 14:50.542
Maybe they like to keep a lot
hidden beneath the surface.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.001
Sort of like you, pal.

14:53.084 --> 14:55.334
- ( taps on glass )
- ( gasps )

14:55.418 --> 14:57.293
- ( man laughs )
- Oh, my God.

14:57.376 --> 14:59.209
- Whoooo!
- Whoa. Wow.

14:59.293 --> 15:01.168
- Here you are.
- Yeah, huh?

15:01.251 --> 15:03.459
Jaguar '67.
An English classic.

15:03.542 --> 15:05.876
Like riding in
the Queen's vagina.

15:05.959 --> 15:09.418
Rough ride, but worth it
for the prestige.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.792
- I'm Lance Klians. Wow.
- It's good to see you.

15:12.876 --> 15:16.168
- Congratulations on the HOF.
- I had to tell Lance. Sorry.

15:16.251 --> 15:19.042
That's OK. Just on the ballot.
We'll see what happens.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.542
Modesty's your superpower,
not mine.

15:21.625 --> 15:23.959
Joe told me a lot about you
in a short time.

15:24.042 --> 15:27.334
Said you guys
really tore up the playa
at the Burn on many occasions.

15:27.418 --> 15:29.084
Yeah, nothing
quite like Joe here

15:29.168 --> 15:31.084
running around
in a pair of steampunk goggles

15:31.168 --> 15:32.209
and a banana hammock.

15:32.293 --> 15:33.584
Christ.
Sorry I missed it.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.042
And I'm sorry I saw it.

15:35.126 --> 15:36.792
I have no regrets.

15:36.876 --> 15:39.917
Lance:
Welcome to our humble abode.

15:40.001 --> 15:44.168
Seven years in the making,
we specialize in extreme sports.

15:44.251 --> 15:48.625
We got 250 employees,
all with impeccable taste,
as you can see.

15:48.709 --> 15:51.042
Athletes, branding,

15:51.126 --> 15:52.917
distribution,
Motocross, BMX.

15:53.001 --> 15:54.709
If you can ride it,
I can sell you on it.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.667
You remember
that Robbie Madison video
"Pipedream"

15:56.750 --> 15:59.251
that I sent you last year?
They did that.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.459
Yeah,
I did that.
With DC Shoes.

16:01.542 --> 16:04.126
Spencer: Ah.
I remember that one.
That looked expensive.

16:04.209 --> 16:07.084
D'you know,
it was expensive.
And it was all on DC's dime.

16:07.168 --> 16:08.376
No, I'm good.

16:08.459 --> 16:09.792
But to put it into perspective,

16:09.876 --> 16:11.334
I don't imagine
it cost a lot more

16:11.418 --> 16:13.459
than that exquisite
pocket square you're sporting.

16:13.542 --> 16:16.876
Yes, Spencer also has
impeccable taste, as do I.

16:16.959 --> 16:18.625
How do you feel about surfing?

16:18.709 --> 16:20.625
Look at him-- do you think
he floats easily?

16:20.709 --> 16:23.251
My ancestors
invented the sport.

16:23.334 --> 16:24.917
Lance: Well, Spencer,
you're in luck,

16:25.001 --> 16:26.418
because the Huntington
Surf Classic is next weekend.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.959
That seems like hella fun.

16:28.042 --> 16:29.709
The pussy is spectacular.

16:29.792 --> 16:31.625
The whole beach is strewn
with pussy.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.126
- That is, if you like pussy.
- I do.

16:33.209 --> 16:35.376
This is Annie.
She's the head of our branding.

16:35.459 --> 16:36.584
- Hi.
- Hello.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.126
And this bright young thing
is Jesse,

16:38.209 --> 16:39.792
she's one of our great
up-and-coming stars

16:39.876 --> 16:41.625
- here at Sports X.
- What up, dudes?

16:41.709 --> 16:43.500
- What up.
- Hey. All right.

16:43.584 --> 16:46.001
Well, I see Lance is keeping
the Human Resource department

16:46.084 --> 16:47.584
extremely busy
these days.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.334
Spencer's very
socially responsible.

16:49.418 --> 16:51.376
We don't mind.
It's just Lance's lingo.

16:51.459 --> 16:53.126
That's right,
just my cunnilingo.

16:53.209 --> 16:55.584
Do you need to know about
our daycare policy,

16:55.667 --> 16:57.500
our drug action schemes?

16:57.584 --> 17:00.834
I'm assuming the drugs
are pretty prevalent
in this culture.

17:00.917 --> 17:02.542
We're more corporate
than you might think.

17:02.625 --> 17:05.418
I myself am five years sober.
Just last week, actually.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.001
Congratulations.
And Burning Man?

17:07.084 --> 17:08.834
- ( Lance stammers )
- Burning Man!

17:08.917 --> 17:10.834
One-week hiatus,
but other than that,
I'm clean.

17:10.917 --> 17:12.876
- Doesn't count.
- Ask anybody you want.

17:12.959 --> 17:14.500
Let me introduce you
to the team.

17:14.584 --> 17:16.834
OK, fuck off, you lot,
the grownups are here,

17:16.917 --> 17:18.584
we've got to talk
about business.

17:18.667 --> 17:21.334
On your way, get out there
and do what you do best.

17:21.418 --> 17:24.500
No one likes a good-
looking homeless person.
Go on, fuck off.

17:24.584 --> 17:26.500
Well, Lance,
I gotta give it to you, man,

17:26.584 --> 17:28.876
this is all very impressive,
and I like the vibe
that you've created here.

17:28.959 --> 17:30.584
That's really kind of you
to say.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.542
And also it's really beautiful
that you came over here,

17:32.625 --> 17:34.168
knight in shining armor action,

17:34.251 --> 17:35.917
because this situation
is properly fucked up.

17:36.001 --> 17:37.876
My financiers come to me
and they say, "We're
buying you out."

17:37.959 --> 17:39.709
I say, "Fuck that,
I'm buying you  out."

17:39.792 --> 17:43.293
Problem is, I don't
exactly have $50 million
just lyin' around.

17:43.376 --> 17:45.834
- Yeah.
- $50 million is a lot of coin

17:45.917 --> 17:49.750
for a shop that represents
pro athletes, regardless
of how hyped they are.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.042
They got a surf channel too.
Tell him about the surf channel.

17:52.126 --> 17:53.251
They're totally vertical.

17:53.334 --> 17:55.168
Joe is telling you
the truth.

17:55.251 --> 17:56.709
One-one-one-three.

17:56.792 --> 17:58.126
Spencer: Wow.

17:58.209 --> 17:59.917
Maybe it could be
a little easier to get to.

18:00.001 --> 18:02.709
It's no different from
typing in 206 for ESPN.

18:02.792 --> 18:04.625
- We're in 20 million homes.
- Spencer: How about events?

18:04.709 --> 18:06.876
- Do you own any of those?
- No, but we would like to.

18:06.959 --> 18:09.459
Listen, Sports X could be
a global Goliath.

18:09.542 --> 18:11.709
Do you really think
our corporate cultures
would be a good fit?

18:11.792 --> 18:13.418
I can get along
with anybody.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.251
But you're never gonna
understand Sports X
in the board room.

18:16.334 --> 18:19.209
Sports X don't happen here.
Sports X happens
out on the beach.

18:19.293 --> 18:21.917
Let's get out there,
feel the sand
between your toes,

18:22.001 --> 18:24.418
the wind blowing
through your... scalps,

18:24.500 --> 18:27.376
- see what it's really about.
- All right. I like it.

18:27.459 --> 18:30.418
Amber: Baby, as much as
I love house-hunting with you,

18:30.500 --> 18:32.084
I'm getting tired.

18:32.168 --> 18:33.792
I'll bet you are.

18:33.876 --> 18:35.542
How do you think I feel?

18:35.625 --> 18:37.792
I'm like a bird
without a nest, baby.

18:37.876 --> 18:39.500
- Me too.
- Shut up, TTD,

18:39.584 --> 18:41.418
before we send your ass
back to South Beach.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.917
We can't get no privacy
in my mama's house

18:43.001 --> 18:45.042
- when we're havin' sex.
- True.

18:45.126 --> 18:46.500
Baby, you don't have to talk

18:46.584 --> 18:48.084
about your sexual habits
in front of your baby.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.709
Why not, Mama? She knows
where she came from.

18:50.792 --> 18:53.042
- Don't you, Serene?
- Let me cover
Baby Serene's ears

18:53.126 --> 18:54.876
so she don't have
to hear this shit.
Ain't that right?

18:54.959 --> 18:58.418
- Why you keep hittin' me?
- Shut the fuck up, TTD.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.917
Baby. Your language
in front of Serene?

19:01.001 --> 19:04.001
You can take your frustrations
out on me if you want to,
but you know what I think?

19:04.084 --> 19:06.834
I think you should rent,
just in case you want
to go back and play.

19:06.917 --> 19:10.126
You don't want to be stuck
with some $15 million mansion
you ain't livin' in.

19:10.209 --> 19:12.459
He ain't goin' back, TTD.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.418
I sat out all season--
didn't miss it at all.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.876
- You tellin' the truth?
- Yeah.

19:16.959 --> 19:19.126
Good. 'Cause you know the rules.

19:19.209 --> 19:21.959
Baby goes where Mommy goes,
and Mommy goes where Daddy goes.

19:22.042 --> 19:24.084
It's what we call a family.

19:24.168 --> 19:27.293
I don't need to be
stuck in some $15 million
Newport Beach mansion

19:27.376 --> 19:29.042
and you gone
half the year in Texas.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.750
'Cause that
would suck for you.
( chuckling )

19:33.667 --> 19:35.709
Ain't gonna happen, baby.
All right?

19:35.792 --> 19:37.293
( phone ringing )

19:39.001 --> 19:41.251
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's Spencer.

19:41.334 --> 19:44.709
Probably about some investments
we're lookin' into.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.209
You know.

19:48.168 --> 19:50.001
♪ ...feel it too ♪

19:50.084 --> 19:52.667
So this surf thing
is a pretty big deal,
huh, Lance?

19:52.750 --> 19:55.500
WSL don't fuck about.
The Offspring are performing,

19:55.584 --> 19:57.334
last year
it was Social Distortion.

19:57.418 --> 19:59.584
- Those are recording artists.
- Yes, I know that, Joe.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.168
I caught 'em on
Warped tour.

20:01.251 --> 20:03.959
You don't strike me
as a Warped tour type of guy.

20:04.042 --> 20:05.876
( laughs )
Trust me, I'm not.

20:05.959 --> 20:07.500
Well, we can
work around that.

20:07.584 --> 20:09.084
The important thing
to understand is,

20:09.168 --> 20:11.168
this is not finance,
this ain't football,

20:11.251 --> 20:12.667
this is more than that.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.251
This is lifestyle.

20:14.334 --> 20:16.709
You know, I like
our lifestyle in Miami

20:16.792 --> 20:18.625
where we have 200 people
counting on us.

20:18.709 --> 20:21.500
What's a couple hundred more,
really, for limitless
opportunity?

20:21.584 --> 20:23.376
All right, tell me
about your current roster.

20:23.459 --> 20:25.376
Pure fire. Tell 'em,
Freelance.

20:25.459 --> 20:29.959
Kelly Slater, Laird Hamilton,
Tony Hawk, Robbie Maddison,

20:30.042 --> 20:33.293
Nyjah Huston, Zion Wright,
Travis Pastrana.

20:33.376 --> 20:35.042
But best of all,

20:35.126 --> 20:37.126
the jewel in
the Sports X crown--

20:37.209 --> 20:39.418
behold... Parker Jones.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.168
Boom.

20:41.251 --> 20:42.876
That's him right there,
rippin'.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.418
He's favored
to win the Classic.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.917
- He's black.
- No, he's not black;

20:47.001 --> 20:48.168
he's green.

20:48.251 --> 20:50.709
This boy is money
wrapped in skin.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.334
So you think he's gonna be
the Jackie Robinson of surfing?

20:53.418 --> 20:55.376
That he's gonna be the one
to break the color barrier?

20:55.459 --> 20:57.917
More than that.
This kid could be like
a black Michael Jackson

20:58.001 --> 20:59.667
with an uncomplicated
erotic life.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.959
( laughs ) I don't even know
what the fuck that means.

21:03.042 --> 21:05.293
But I like
your forward thinking.

21:05.376 --> 21:07.709
But this is not our business.

21:07.792 --> 21:09.542
OK, listen,
I'm gonna leave
you guys

21:09.625 --> 21:11.334
to your couples counseling
session.

21:11.418 --> 21:13.959
I'm gonna consult with
the Great Consigliere
in the sky. Mwah.

21:14.042 --> 21:16.168
All right.
We'll be here.

21:16.251 --> 21:18.792
- Gotta love that guy, right?
- This is not us.

21:18.876 --> 21:20.459
It's not what we do.
This isn't who we are.

21:20.542 --> 21:22.542
Come on, Joe, I got
fuckin' sand in my shoes.

21:22.625 --> 21:24.209
We're anybody
we want to be.

21:24.293 --> 21:26.418
That's what you
always say to me,  right?

21:26.500 --> 21:30.418
Were we financial managers?
Were we real estate developers?

21:30.500 --> 21:35.542
Were we shoulders
for 6'5", 300-pound
Super Bowl losers to cry on?

21:35.625 --> 21:39.376
No, we were
none of those things,
but we did it all, right?

21:39.459 --> 21:43.251
You're ready
to bet $50 million
on your boy Lance?

21:43.334 --> 21:45.584
Joe:
Yeah. Yeah.

21:45.667 --> 21:47.542
I think so. I mean,
you know, with our help...

21:47.625 --> 21:50.792
You think so, or you know?
You don't even sound sure,
Joe.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.459
Hey, hey, hey.

21:52.542 --> 21:54.500
I'm ready.

21:54.584 --> 21:56.334
How long would I
have to be out here?

21:56.418 --> 21:59.584
Jesus Christ, man,
what is your negative vibe
with this place?

21:59.667 --> 22:01.293
Are you delinquent
on child support?

22:01.376 --> 22:03.667
Are you ducking
a paternity suit
with a Laker Girl?

22:03.750 --> 22:07.500
- It's complicated, Joe.
- I didn't ask for your
fuckin' Facebook status.

22:07.584 --> 22:11.042
I'm just asking
for you to get with me
on this opportunity.

22:11.126 --> 22:13.792
Text your boy,
tell him we'll be back.
I want to show you something.

22:13.876 --> 22:15.500
OK.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.459
Joe: I don't know if he's got
his phone on him, but...

22:18.542 --> 22:21.168
you know, he'll get it.

22:21.251 --> 22:24.667
What's up, y'all?
Charles. How ya doin'?

22:24.750 --> 22:28.251
- Little chilly in here.
- I could have them
turn off the A.C.

22:28.334 --> 22:31.168
I'm talking about
the reception, Andrew.

22:31.251 --> 22:34.876
- I do feel the ice grill.
- Yeah.

22:34.959 --> 22:37.834
I guess everyone's pretty upset
that Les is gone, huh?

22:37.917 --> 22:40.251
No, they've just
gotten attached
to their jobs,

22:40.334 --> 22:43.876
and they know with you here,
those days might be numbered.

22:43.959 --> 22:45.834
- Ahem!
- ( glass clinking )

22:45.917 --> 22:48.001
Charles:
Excuse me, everybody!

22:48.084 --> 22:49.792
How y'all doin'?

22:49.876 --> 22:53.293
My name is Charles Greane,
the new GM of the Rams,

22:53.376 --> 22:56.376
as I'm sure most of you
already know.

22:56.459 --> 22:59.792
Now, I don't want to be called
"sir," or "Mr. Greane,"

22:59.876 --> 23:01.709
or "Mr. General Manager."

23:01.792 --> 23:04.750
"Charles" is fine.

23:04.834 --> 23:07.500
All right, well, I just want
to let you all know
that I respect you all,

23:07.584 --> 23:11.168
and I'm here for you
during this difficult
period of transition.

23:11.251 --> 23:12.625
So if have any questions--

23:12.709 --> 23:14.876
Man: Why'd they cancel
the chocolate chip cookies?

23:14.959 --> 23:16.917
Woman:
We don't blitz enough!

23:17.001 --> 23:19.042
That is a statement,
not a question, ma'am.

23:19.126 --> 23:21.334
They call the chocolate chip
cookie cancelation Cookiegate.

23:21.418 --> 23:23.376
I did not know that.
Thank you.

23:23.459 --> 23:25.792
- What is it that
you do here, sir?
- Merchandising.

23:25.876 --> 23:27.917
Licensing and Merchandising.

23:28.001 --> 23:30.418
( Charles clapping alone )

23:30.500 --> 23:32.542
One of my favorite,
uh, departments.

23:32.625 --> 23:34.376
I sell T-shirts
at a concession stand.

23:34.459 --> 23:37.459
Still a big contribution.
Your job is safe!

23:37.542 --> 23:39.917
Just make sure
you stay stocked up

23:40.001 --> 23:42.750
with triple-XL for all
the big, cuddly guys,
all right?

23:42.834 --> 23:45.251
- What about my  job?
- Our  jobs?

23:45.334 --> 23:48.542
- That's a little bit
more complicated.
- Oh, bullshit.

23:48.625 --> 23:51.542
Look, we're all here
for one another, OK?

23:51.625 --> 23:53.834
We can set the tone.

23:53.917 --> 23:56.834
You guys are the backbone
of this great organization.

23:56.917 --> 23:57.917
You are the Rams!

23:58.001 --> 24:00.917
Are our jobs safe?
Yes or no?

24:01.001 --> 24:03.500
All:
Yeah!

24:03.584 --> 24:04.500
Charles: Uh...

24:07.001 --> 24:10.209
Yeah! Hell, yeah,
everybody's job is safe!

24:10.293 --> 24:11.876
- How 'bout that?
- ( all cheer )

24:11.959 --> 24:14.251
All right?
And I'm bringing back

24:14.334 --> 24:16.584
the damn
chocolate chip cookies!

24:16.667 --> 24:18.376
Huh?!

24:18.459 --> 24:21.625
Go Rams! Yeah!

24:21.709 --> 24:24.584
( all cheering, clapping )

24:24.667 --> 24:26.709
( mouths word )

24:39.542 --> 24:43.126
Joe: So, what is this?
You take me out here
to whack me?

24:43.209 --> 24:45.625
No, relax,
I'm not gonna
kill you, buddy.

24:45.709 --> 24:48.293
Even though I
thought about it
a ton of times.

24:48.376 --> 24:50.459
Yeah, well,
join the club.

24:50.542 --> 24:53.042
I thought about
killing myself
a bunch of times,

24:53.126 --> 24:55.459
but too much of a pussy.

24:55.542 --> 24:57.625
Well, I'm glad
you didn't do that.

24:57.709 --> 25:00.293
I wouldn't want
to lose you, too.

25:00.376 --> 25:02.168
My brother
jumped off this bridge.

25:04.042 --> 25:05.667
Are you
fuckin' with me?

25:05.750 --> 25:08.584
No, do I look like
I'm fuckin' with you?

25:08.667 --> 25:10.500
William Strasmore.

25:10.584 --> 25:12.709
Took a clean fuckin' jump
and killed himself.

25:12.792 --> 25:14.667
- Jesus!
- Yeah,

25:14.750 --> 25:17.834
I was in my junior year
at the U.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.418
He was a star QB here
for the Trojans.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.959
Oh, yeah,
that rings a bell.

25:23.042 --> 25:24.251
Strasmore.

25:24.334 --> 25:27.876
Shit. Well,
what went wrong?

25:27.959 --> 25:29.709
Just nothin' went right.

25:31.001 --> 25:33.251
Didn't start out
like that, though.

25:33.334 --> 25:34.418
I'm sorry, man.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.168
- I had no idea.
- Nah, it's OK.

25:36.251 --> 25:37.625
Not many people do.

25:37.709 --> 25:41.168
He was my big brother.
The original.

25:41.251 --> 25:44.168
He did everything I did,
only much better.

25:44.251 --> 25:47.876
Fuck, I haven't been out here
since I buried him.

25:47.959 --> 25:49.792
That's pretty heavy shit,
man.

25:49.876 --> 25:51.959
Even for me, and I learned
how to cremate my wife

25:52.042 --> 25:53.418
on a do-it-yourself website.

25:57.042 --> 25:59.459
Yeah, L.A. can be
a dark place, brother,

25:59.542 --> 26:02.459
but for me it's something
much worse.

26:08.792 --> 26:11.418
It has an indoor grill,
and  an outdoor grill.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.625
Why you say that
like it's some sort
of necessity?

26:13.709 --> 26:17.251
You think because we black,
we gonna die if we don't have
multiple barbecues?

26:17.334 --> 26:20.126
- Don't listen to him.
He's just fuckin' with you.
- ( phone ringing )

26:20.209 --> 26:22.834
- Amber: Shut the fuck up, TTD.
- It's Spence again.

26:22.917 --> 26:24.459
Well, maybe you should
pick it up.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.376
( sighs ) Yeah,
you're right.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.251
It's probably
about that money.
Excuse me.

26:29.334 --> 26:32.418
- ( softly ) What up, J?
- How's my long-lost client?

26:32.500 --> 26:35.168
Shit, you got
that "lost" part right.
Tell me something good, dawg.

26:35.251 --> 26:37.168
I did what you asked,
I made some calls.

26:37.251 --> 26:39.251
Good news.
We may have a team.

26:39.334 --> 26:40.750
OK, who?

26:40.834 --> 26:42.459
Cleveland.

26:42.542 --> 26:44.293
Are you fuckin' serious?

26:44.376 --> 26:46.709
That's worse than being here,
stuck at home with Amber.

26:46.792 --> 26:47.834
Yeah, I thought that

26:47.917 --> 26:50.126
you might say that.
But, listen,

26:50.209 --> 26:52.251
now that people know
that we're open for business

26:52.334 --> 26:53.750
and that you are ready to play,

26:53.834 --> 26:55.418
more offers are gonna come.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.834
J, I ain't built for this, man.
You gotta save me.

26:57.917 --> 27:01.042
You're the one.
Well, you and Jesus.

27:01.126 --> 27:02.876
Listen, Ricky,
try putting out

27:02.959 --> 27:04.959
some good, positive energy
into the universe,

27:05.042 --> 27:06.792
and you will get
good shit back--
trust me.

27:10.459 --> 27:11.917
( blows air )

27:17.293 --> 27:20.584
- Shit, I love this place.
What they askin'?
- 15 mil.

27:20.667 --> 27:22.001
Fuck it!

27:22.084 --> 27:24.293
( laughs )
Let's put down some roots.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.042
Not to sound arrogant,

27:26.126 --> 27:28.293
but I like a lot
of different guys.

27:28.376 --> 27:30.418
I take a little bit from
a lot of different players,

27:30.500 --> 27:33.251
but at the end of the day,
I just feel like I'm different.

27:33.334 --> 27:35.293
I have my own game,
my own style...

27:35.376 --> 27:37.001
Is that the kid
Jason was calling you about?

27:37.084 --> 27:39.001
- Yeah, yeah.
- He's impressive.

27:39.084 --> 27:41.667
Camera-ready, too.

27:41.750 --> 27:45.126
I'm not really
lookin' at the kid,
I'm lookin' at his mom.

27:45.209 --> 27:48.042
- That's his fuckin' mom?
- Yeah.

27:48.126 --> 27:51.667
Wow. I stand corrected.
You should take that meeting.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.542
- Hey, we didn't see you there.
- No worries,

27:54.625 --> 27:55.917
I know I'm easy to miss.

27:56.001 --> 27:57.959
Yes, you are.
Let's have a seat.

27:58.042 --> 28:00.001
You follow
high school football?

28:00.084 --> 28:01.667
I watch everything
and everybody.

28:01.750 --> 28:03.500
Figure I'll be seeing the kid
in about three years.

28:03.584 --> 28:05.917
That's how you become
Defensive Player of the Year.

28:06.001 --> 28:08.376
Exactly.
It's all in the prep.

28:08.459 --> 28:10.001
Sort of like life, right?

28:10.084 --> 28:13.126
Yeah, but investing?
That scares the shit
out of me.

28:13.209 --> 28:15.834
It's all right.
That's why we're here,
and we're gonna help you.

28:15.917 --> 28:18.876
Yeah. We pride ourselves
on making the right choices.

28:18.959 --> 28:21.917
We're gonna create
an investment strategy
designed just for you.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.834
Joe: Do you have
any questions for us?

28:23.917 --> 28:26.001
Jason told me
y'all were the best
in the business.

28:26.084 --> 28:28.084
So if he trusts you,
I trust you.

28:28.168 --> 28:31.334
Plus, you guys flew here
to see me, so... I'm in.

28:31.459 --> 28:33.251
- All right.
- Let's do it.

28:33.334 --> 28:35.667
- What do I owe?
- For the water?

28:35.750 --> 28:37.542
We gotcha.

28:37.625 --> 28:39.584
- How about that?
- Appreciate it.

28:39.667 --> 28:42.834
- Now make me some money.
- We'll make that money
for you.

28:44.500 --> 28:46.168
Well, shit, man.

28:46.251 --> 28:48.334
That was easier than
I thought it would be.

28:48.418 --> 28:50.126
Because our reputation
precedes us,

28:50.209 --> 28:52.042
and deals like this
are just gonna get
easier and easier.

28:52.126 --> 28:54.168
While others get
harder and harder.

28:54.251 --> 28:56.584
You lickin' your wounds already?
Is that what I'm...?

28:56.667 --> 28:59.168
I'm not, honestly.
I wasn't even thinking
about my wounds.

28:59.251 --> 29:02.251
- I was thinking about yours.
- Don't think about my wounds.

29:02.334 --> 29:05.042
- They're way too deep.
- Right. That's why the only
thing I want to do right now

29:05.126 --> 29:07.168
is get you back to Miami
in one piece.

29:07.251 --> 29:09.459
We're not going back
to Miami.

29:14.667 --> 29:16.459
Oh, wow.

29:17.959 --> 29:19.876
Spence...

29:23.084 --> 29:26.168
I so appreciate you
indulging me,
I really do.

29:26.251 --> 29:28.251
But it's not necessary.

29:28.334 --> 29:31.792
I don't need to put
my pursuit of success over
your mental well-being.

29:31.876 --> 29:34.667
This is not a healthy place
for you.

29:34.750 --> 29:36.542
( sighs )
No, it's not.

29:36.625 --> 29:38.126
No, it's not.
Understood.

29:38.209 --> 29:40.792
So I'll call Lance
and tell him we're out.

29:40.876 --> 29:43.209
( exhales )

29:43.293 --> 29:45.625
Joe, this place
may be a bad idea for me,

29:45.709 --> 29:47.959
but it's a helluva
good one for you.

29:48.042 --> 29:50.750
Plus, it'll force me
to take care of my shit.

29:50.834 --> 29:54.084
And that's been
a long time comin',
my friend.

29:54.168 --> 29:56.917
So we're gonna stay here,
we're gonna make that deal.

29:57.001 --> 29:59.834
You'd do that for me?

29:59.917 --> 30:02.584
I would only  do that for you.

30:03.834 --> 30:05.709
I have to do this.

30:05.792 --> 30:09.584
I-- I want  to do this.
I need  to do this.

30:09.667 --> 30:11.209
Thank you so much!

30:11.293 --> 30:13.334
- Whoa! Easy, big guy.
- You understand!

30:13.418 --> 30:15.542
You understand.
Thank you.

30:15.625 --> 30:19.584
Thank you for
suffering for me.

RICKY JERRET: Are we talking
about playing in Cali?

31:59.792 --> 32:01.168
With you? I'm interested.

32:01.834 --> 32:03.542
This video. Looks pricey.
