[dramatic music]

00:04.472 --> 00:10.044
*

00:10.078 --> 00:11.679
- My name is John Rainey.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.647
The first time
I sat behind an anvil,

00:13.681 --> 00:16.084
I was two years old
in a diaper.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.652
My grandfather's idea
of babysitting was

00:18.686 --> 00:20.754
to put me behind an anvil
with a hammer

00:20.788 --> 00:22.456
and a cold piece
of metal and say,

00:22.490 --> 00:24.625
"Here, make me something."

00:24.658 --> 00:27.428
- My name is Nate Summers.
I am a full-time security guard.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.697
I currently hold
a Master Smith rating,

00:29.730 --> 00:32.433
and I would love to become
a full-time bladesmith.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.102
This is my coming-out party.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.271
Yeah, I'm a bladesmith.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.307
- My name is Jim Poor.
I've been making horseshoeing

00:39.340 --> 00:42.176
and blacksmithing tools
for 30 years,

00:42.210 --> 00:45.313
and blades is just part of that.
I'm a tool nut.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.515
There's no hand tools
in my shop.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.817
- My name is Richard Epting.
I'm a research fabricator

00:49.850 --> 00:51.652
for a university

00:51.685 --> 00:54.488
and I've been bladesmithing
for 30 years.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.290
The scientist in me loves

00:56.324 --> 00:59.527
the metallurgical part
of knife-making.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.462
I have a PhD in the school
of hard knocks.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.630
I've been there.
I've made it.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.266
There is no losing.

01:05.299 --> 01:08.269
- Bladesmiths, welcome
to the Forge.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.238
You know why you're here:
for three rounds

01:10.271 --> 01:11.839
of edged
weapon-making competition

01:11.872 --> 01:13.707
designed to test every
aspect of your skills.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.809
And of course, after each round,

01:15.843 --> 01:18.112
you will present your work
to our panel of expert judges

01:18.146 --> 01:19.580
because they decide
who gets the title

01:19.613 --> 01:21.415
and the $10,000 cash.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.217
Let's meet them now.

01:23.251 --> 01:26.520
Up first, ABS master
smith J. Neilson.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.456
Next, historic weapons
recreation specialist

01:28.489 --> 01:31.792
David Baker and edged weapons
specialist Doug Marcaida.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.527
All right, gentlemen,
on the anvils in front of you

01:33.561 --> 01:37.731
is a cloth.
Go ahead and lift that up.

01:37.765 --> 01:41.569
That is two stacks
of high-quality carbon steel.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.837
You will use these two steels
to create a signature blade

01:43.871 --> 01:47.675
in your signature style
that is also Damascus,

01:47.708 --> 01:49.643
but that's not all.

01:49.677 --> 01:53.647
In this challenge,
you will also be using these.

01:58.252 --> 02:02.156
- Oh, great. We're gonna have
to make a knife out of a drill?

02:02.190 --> 02:04.892
- Don't freak out yet.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.627
You don't have to use
these drill presses

02:06.660 --> 02:08.629
as part of your
blade's construction.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.299
Instead, you'll be
using them to create

02:11.332 --> 02:13.301
a unique Damascus pattern

02:13.334 --> 02:16.504
known as a raindrop
Damascus. J?

02:16.537 --> 02:18.539
- This is a pattern
I've been doing for years.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.475
This is actually my favorite
Damascus pattern out there.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.777
Raindrop is a layered
Damascus pattern

02:23.811 --> 02:26.580
where you drill divots into
the steel through the layers

02:26.614 --> 02:28.349
and then forge them
back to the surface,

02:28.382 --> 02:30.284
bringing up those circular

02:30.318 --> 02:31.819
or raindrop patterns
going down your blade.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.388
The more raindrops,
the better it looks,

02:34.422 --> 02:37.225
so let's have a downpour
out there, okay?

02:37.258 --> 02:38.459
- Now you can freak out.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.794
[laughter]

02:40.828 --> 02:42.530
Keep in mind that in round two,

02:42.563 --> 02:43.931
you'll be putting
handles on your blades

02:43.964 --> 02:45.799
to turn them into
fully-functional weapons

02:45.833 --> 02:47.601
that will then be tested
for strength and durability

02:47.635 --> 02:49.837
in an antler chop

02:49.870 --> 02:53.974
and for edge retention
in a beef rib slice.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.809
Additionally,
the raindrop pattern

02:55.843 --> 02:57.578
must be visible
in your steel,

02:57.611 --> 02:59.880
so you are required
to acid etch your blades

02:59.913 --> 03:01.715
before the round is over.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.851
You will have ten minutes
to work on your design,

03:03.884 --> 03:05.786
and because of the difficulty
in this challenge,

03:05.819 --> 03:09.357
you will have four hours
to forge your blades.

03:09.390 --> 03:13.494
- Normally it takes me a few
days to make raindrop Damascus.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.497
Four hours is crazy.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.433
- Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your time starts now.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.903
*

03:22.936 --> 03:26.474
We've given our smiths
some fairly pristine steel.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.709
What are the mistakes?
How does a smith lose this?

03:28.742 --> 03:31.379
- Well, the big thing is,
when you weld enough Damascus,

03:31.412 --> 03:33.447
your heat is key.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.383
I mean, you want to get these
to a semi-plastic state

03:35.416 --> 03:37.518
where you can actually
weld them to stick,

03:37.551 --> 03:40.020
so one homogenous
piece of steel.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.390
- My strategy going into this is

03:42.423 --> 03:44.592
to pay more attention
to function than form.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.828
If the function is not there,
aesthetics will mean nothing.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.530
I'm making a bowie knife

03:49.563 --> 03:51.899
because I can make
the blade robust,

03:51.932 --> 03:54.735
and that's exactly what an
antler chop is gonna need.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.737
*

03:56.770 --> 03:58.906
- I have not made
raindrop Damascus,

03:58.939 --> 04:01.609
but I'm excited to do it.

04:01.642 --> 04:05.446
I don't know how fast I am,
so I'm not going for the zest.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.748
I'm going for
a functional blade.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.684
I'm making kind of a hybrid
between a bowie and a kukri.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.654
This type of knife
would be very effective

04:13.687 --> 04:15.923
on both antler and bones

04:15.956 --> 04:18.926
because it has a lot
of weight to it.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.495
- Another thing that can happen
while making a Damascus

04:21.529 --> 04:23.464
with any kind of pattern
that you're gonna cut in,

04:23.497 --> 04:25.833
you're losing steel
as you're drilling that out,

04:25.866 --> 04:27.701
so you need to start
with a bigger billet

04:27.735 --> 04:30.003
than you're used
to starting with.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.972
- I'm gonna be designing
a camp-style knife.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.342
The forging of Damascus
steel really,

04:34.375 --> 04:36.076
really just flips my switch.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.679
- We might want to take down
Richard's contact info

04:38.712 --> 04:41.449
just in case we need a stand-in
for Dave one day.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.083
- That's not a bad idea,
not a bad idea.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.952
- You'll have to whiten
his hair a little bit.

04:44.985 --> 04:49.056
- [chuckling]

04:49.089 --> 04:51.525
- I'm making a bowie because
those antlers

04:51.559 --> 04:53.661
are gonna tear our blades up,
I'm afraid,

04:53.694 --> 04:56.597
so I'm gonna put more of
a chisel edge on mine,

04:56.630 --> 04:58.832
hoping it will hold up
to the task.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.868
- Bladesmiths, your design
period is closed.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.505
Your four-hour forge
time starts now.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.007
*

05:07.040 --> 05:09.410
- And here we go.

05:09.443 --> 05:12.079
So, Jake, each stack
should have holes in them,

05:12.112 --> 05:13.981
or you just alternate them?

05:14.014 --> 05:16.083
- Once you get all of
your layers stacked up,

05:16.116 --> 05:17.851
and you're done building layers,

05:17.885 --> 05:19.953
that's when you pattern it.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.823
- Damascus is a sickness,
I think.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.859
Because every time
you make a billet,

05:25.893 --> 05:27.828
that drives you on to make
the next one,

05:27.861 --> 05:29.963
and then you'll see something
someone else had made,

05:29.997 --> 05:31.765
and you're like,
"I got to make that."

05:31.799 --> 05:34.468
- Jim already into the forge.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.836
- Did Jim use everything?

05:35.869 --> 05:38.138
- No.
- I only used 16 pieces.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.508
I know that's more than enough
to make the blade.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.075
- What do you think of that, J.?

05:42.109 --> 05:44.612
- They started out
with 23 pieces of steel.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.747
I'd use it all. You can always
cut off some excess,

05:46.780 --> 05:48.048
but you don't want to take
the time to have to say,

05:48.081 --> 05:49.650
"Oh, no, I don't have enough."

05:52.720 --> 05:55.489
- I'm gonna use all the metal
that the judges gave me.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.691
I want to make
as much steel as I can

05:57.725 --> 05:59.493
because the raindrop pattern

05:59.527 --> 06:02.596
looks a lot better
at a high layer count.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.432
I like to get
my raindrop patterns

06:04.465 --> 06:06.934
around 250 to 300
layers is optimum.

06:06.967 --> 06:10.037
We're just gonna watch the time
and just go from there.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.939
- You want to get
a really good pattern.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.974
Personally, I'd like to see
at least 200 layers.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.609
- Where the hell is the flux at?

06:15.643 --> 06:18.078
- Oh, speaking of which...
- Ah, yes.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.447
- Let us bow our heads.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.914
Lord, please don't let people

06:20.948 --> 06:23.751
try to use flux
as glue this time.

06:23.784 --> 06:27.455
- They use so much flux, we have
to change out the forges

06:27.488 --> 06:30.190
'cause the bottom
of those forges are so sticky.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.792
- Here, grab it off my table,
right there.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.961
- John's got me
concerned already.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.797
Out of the 23 pieces
of steel he got,

06:36.830 --> 06:39.767
13 are still sitting
on his workbench.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.870
- We were given a good deal
of quality metal.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.938
There's enough material there
to make two

06:44.972 --> 06:46.574
or three of those knives.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.609
My grandfather
was a Master Smith.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.110
He would always tell me,
he says,

06:50.143 --> 06:52.980
"John, don't waste time
working metal

06:53.013 --> 06:55.949
that's not gonna be
part of the blade."

06:55.983 --> 06:59.720
- Oh.
- I hate it when that happens.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.989
- I'm ready to start
my first stack.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.957
I would like to end up
with a knife

07:03.991 --> 07:07.561
that has somewhere between
120 to 180 layers of steel.

07:07.595 --> 07:10.631
Forging Damascus by cutting it

07:10.664 --> 07:14.468
and stacking it is a matter
of compounding numbers.

07:14.502 --> 07:18.472
2, 4, 8, 16, 32.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.240
I save myself time
in the long run

07:20.273 --> 07:22.810
if I fold it into thirds
instead of just in half.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.478
- Nathan's doing good.
He's actually doing

07:24.512 --> 07:26.046
an extra forge weld on there

07:26.079 --> 07:30.117
to build his layer count up.
I like that.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.553
- I'm really, really worried
about the antler chop,

07:32.586 --> 07:36.156
so I've decided to make my
Damascus a little different.

07:36.189 --> 07:41.094
I'm gonna use three pieces of my
leftover steel down the center

07:41.128 --> 07:44.064
and weld that up
so that I have good steel,

07:44.097 --> 07:47.100
not welded steel,
for the cutting edge.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.236
Okay, we're set.

07:49.269 --> 07:53.073
- You have only two hours
remaining to finish your work!

07:53.106 --> 07:54.908
- I'm gonna say,
with this layer count

07:54.942 --> 07:56.810
that I got, I'm done.
We'll run out of time.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.712
I'm a little bit
below 100 layers.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.849
Normally I want
250 layers or so.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.951
I know it's not
gonna look as good,

08:03.984 --> 08:06.186
but the clock
is the huge factor here,

08:06.219 --> 08:10.290
so I got to let it cool before
I start drilling the holes.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.793
- Richard even looks over
his glasses like you do.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.896
- This is how I roll.

08:15.929 --> 08:19.232
This is a Texas thing: starched
clothes, starched jeans.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.835
I could change the oil
in my truck wearing what I wear.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.872
- Someone at this table has to
maintain a grooming standard,

08:24.905 --> 08:27.608
and someone out there
has to as well.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.876
Thank you very much.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.745
*

08:31.779 --> 08:34.014
- I'm laying out the holes
for my raindrops

08:34.047 --> 08:35.983
because I want them
to be even on both sides.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.118
You don't want a hole
from this side

08:38.151 --> 08:40.053
touching the hole on this side.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.589
You want them stair-stepped
all the way through,

08:41.622 --> 08:43.791
kind of like a ladder pattern.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.993
- How far down do you want
to drill in?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.160
- I usually go down
about a third.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.030
*

08:50.063 --> 08:52.700
- I'm used to a monster
drill press that--

08:52.733 --> 08:54.167
vvvv, vvvv.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.003
And this little baby thing is--

08:56.036 --> 08:58.606
nnnngggh.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.173
It's taking me forever.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.043
I feel it, you know.
Richard's next to me.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.145
I'm glancing over at him every
now and then, he's just going--

09:05.178 --> 09:06.914
bfff, bfff!

09:06.947 --> 09:10.017
Not mine. Nnnnggh.

09:10.050 --> 09:15.623
*

09:15.656 --> 09:18.325
- Now, J., I'm watching Nate
over here drilling his holes.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.594
You said he should
at least go down

09:20.628 --> 09:21.862
a third of the way
of the billet.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.797
- Yeah.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.599
- It doesn't seem to be
a third of the way.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.367
- Is there a danger of not
drilling deep enough

09:27.400 --> 09:30.337
and then grinding off all
of the teardrops that you made?

09:30.370 --> 09:33.040
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, you might end
up having a few up by the spine,

09:33.073 --> 09:35.375
and then you just got waves
on the bottom.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.611
- I feel like I'm in good shape.
I have just enough time

09:37.645 --> 09:39.346
to finally smash this
into a blank

09:39.379 --> 09:40.981
and start forging a knife.

09:41.014 --> 09:44.317
- Three hours has elapsed!

09:44.351 --> 09:47.054
- Using those tongs that
I'm not used to,

09:47.087 --> 09:49.356
I feel like I'm trying to work
with my feet.

09:49.389 --> 09:52.626
Driving me absolutely bonkers.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.395
- It's hard to hang onto
a billet like that with tongs.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.030
- I don't understand
why he hasn't taken

09:57.064 --> 09:59.299
the three minutes
it would take him

09:59.332 --> 10:01.368
to go weld another work stick.

10:01.401 --> 10:05.072
- [growling]

10:05.105 --> 10:07.174
Starting to feel every muscle

10:07.207 --> 10:08.942
and every bone
in your body ache.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.748
I've never been put
in a situation

10:14.782 --> 10:17.184
to where I had to function
under duress like this.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.852
This is frustrating.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.321
At this point,
I'm in a lot of trouble,

10:21.354 --> 10:22.956
and then I realize
I can't do it.

10:22.990 --> 10:27.027
I'm just ready to give up.

10:27.060 --> 10:30.130
- Come on, John. Oh, my God.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.865
- He's self-eliminating.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.267
- I've never been put
in a situation

10:34.301 --> 10:37.705
to where I had to function
under duress like this.

10:37.738 --> 10:41.041
I don't know if I can
get this accomplished.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.244
- The thing is, you come to this
arena, you're away from home,

10:44.277 --> 10:46.179
and if you're not ready
for that changeup,

10:46.213 --> 10:47.815
it'll start getting
to your head.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.449
- Oh, yeah.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.251
- But then I think,

10:51.284 --> 10:53.253
"What would my
grandpa have done?"

10:53.286 --> 10:56.089
And I just go, "You know what,
I'm gonna stick by my guns

10:56.123 --> 10:58.325
and just take my time
and do things correctly."

10:58.358 --> 11:00.928
- He's gonna go cut and fold.
- Good.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.996
- Good. He hasn't stopped.

11:03.030 --> 11:06.299
- What I do turn in is gonna be
the best of my ability.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.401
*

11:08.435 --> 11:10.303
- You know whose
blade looks fantastic?

11:10.337 --> 11:11.271
- Jim's?
- Jim's.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.206
- Jim's.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.808
- I've started making
my blade now.

11:14.842 --> 11:15.976
I've got the raindrop pattern
in there.

11:16.009 --> 11:16.977
I think it looks pretty good.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.079
- Look at this guy.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.081
- That's a farrier's swing
right there.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.917
- Man, this guy is furious!

11:23.951 --> 11:25.786
- I think I want
Jim's autograph.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.320
- Now you know
why everybody on TV

11:27.354 --> 11:28.756
looks like they're sweating
their asses off.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.723
- Because they are.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.358
- They are.

11:31.391 --> 11:36.063
- You have just
30 minutes remaining!

11:36.096 --> 11:39.232
- Time is running out, but my
approach to forging is simple:

11:39.266 --> 11:41.168
complete each step
before you move on.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.203
- Nathan's profile
looks beautiful.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.372
He's forged
a really nice recurve.

11:45.405 --> 11:49.476
He needs to stop playing with it
and get to the grinder.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.079
Oh, we got flames
on the drill press.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.215
The little bits of hot steel are
mixing with the cutting fluid,

11:55.248 --> 11:56.383
and they're just burning.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.251
- Oh, dude.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.152
- Oh, dude,
John's still drilling holes.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.453
- Oh, yeah.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.089
- John's getting
his second wind.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.191
- John needs to move
a lot of steel,

12:04.224 --> 12:05.458
and he needs to move it fast.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.160
- As I see time running out,

12:07.194 --> 12:09.763
I say, "You know what?
I just feel alive.

12:09.797 --> 12:13.100
I just take in the breath,
and I go, "Wow, this is it.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.503
This is life."

12:16.536 --> 12:18.071
- My shape's coming together.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.506
Everything is really good
and flat.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.341
I've only got
a few minutes left.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.976
I need to heat-treat this,
and then I'll go back,

12:23.010 --> 12:24.377
and I'll finish grinding.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.314
At least that way,
I'm heat-treated.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.851
- We've got a quenched blade
with Richard.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.185
- There we go.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.386
- First one in.
- Come on, baby.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.789
Come on. I have 20 minutes left.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.290
I need to get
this thing quenched.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.961
Anything can go wrong.

12:40.994 --> 12:45.265
- There weo, in the fire. Yay.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.067
- I check with a file.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.468
I'm good all the way
down the blade.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.104
I'm happy.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.574
- Our first acid etch is in the
bath right there with Richard.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.844
- You got nine minutes, bubba.
I'd start etching.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.312
- Hot.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.481
- Oh, that's nice, yeah.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.150
- There you go.
- Good job, Nate.

13:03.183 --> 13:07.120
That looks really nice.
Come on, Nate.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.890
- It's fine, Nate.
I love it. Etch it.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.059
*

13:12.092 --> 13:14.027
- You really just want to yell
at him sometimes.

13:14.061 --> 13:16.363
- Yeah.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.932
- Come on, John,
just quench the dang thing.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.001
- There's an outside chance
one of these guys

13:21.034 --> 13:22.335
could've done something wrong

13:22.369 --> 13:24.504
which would eliminate them.

13:24.537 --> 13:29.910
If that does happen, there's not
gonna be faults in my metal.

13:29.943 --> 13:35.348
- Raindrop. We got a raindrop.
- Yeah, we did it, man.

13:35.382 --> 13:39.619
- One minute, bladesmiths.
- Nate, you need to etch.

13:39.652 --> 13:44.124
- Come on. Ugh!

13:44.157 --> 13:46.226
- If Nate doesn't etch,
is that missing a parameter?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.327
- Yeah.

13:47.360 --> 13:52.933
*

13:52.966 --> 13:54.234
- There we go.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.036
- Yes! Whew.

13:56.069 --> 14:02.910
*

14:02.943 --> 14:06.413
- Ten, nine, eight, seven,

14:06.446 --> 14:08.581
six, five,

14:08.615 --> 14:14.054
four, three, two, one.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.555
Bladesmiths, shut down
your machines.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.658
This forging round is over.

14:18.691 --> 14:22.162
- I'm embarrassed about the fact
that I was so slow,

14:22.195 --> 14:23.296
but at the same time,

14:23.330 --> 14:25.165
I'm proud of the fact

14:25.198 --> 14:27.200
that I did work
to the best of my ability,

14:27.234 --> 14:29.136
and I'm extremely confident

14:29.169 --> 14:31.404
that if I were allowed
to finish that blade,

14:31.438 --> 14:34.507
it would do everything
it's supposed to do.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.643
- Well, bladesmiths, it's time
for the judges

14:36.676 --> 14:38.345
to take a closer look
at your work.

14:38.378 --> 14:42.115
Richard, you're up first.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.617
- Richard, I like
the profile overall.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.520
I see you got a nice pattern
going down. Big blade.

14:47.554 --> 14:51.091
Just keep an eye on your balance
points for the chopping.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.592
But very nicely done.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.261
- Thank you.
- You know, I'd love

14:54.294 --> 14:56.096
to see a distal taper
on this blade.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.465
Right now it's pretty much
the same thickness,

14:58.498 --> 15:02.402
but I want to give you
bonus points for style.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.004
What's in your back left pocket?

15:04.037 --> 15:09.042
- A bandana.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.443
- A doppelganger.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.479
- I feel gross all of a sudden.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.447
[laughter]

15:14.481 --> 15:18.285
- Nate, you're up.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.686
- I like the recurve
that you put in, almost like

15:19.719 --> 15:21.721
a yatagan style.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.991
I don't see much of that pattern
that we're looking for.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.993
It's in there. It actually
goes all the way through,

15:26.026 --> 15:27.560
but it's not that deep
where you put your divots,

15:27.594 --> 15:29.362
and if you grind it over here,

15:29.396 --> 15:32.165
you might lose some of
that pattern here.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.733
- It's gonna be, you know,

15:33.766 --> 15:35.335
interesting to see
what goes on in here.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.337
You've got a very,
very long Ricasso,

15:37.370 --> 15:40.073
and you've still got
a lot of material there,

15:40.107 --> 15:43.143
and it would be nice
to see this all refined.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.145
- Okay.
- Jim, you're up.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.746
Present your work to the judges.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.549
*

15:49.582 --> 15:52.285
- Well, Jim, after watching
your hammer work,

15:52.319 --> 15:54.421
I think I want your autograph.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.456
That was very nice to watch.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.358
- Cool.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.361
- Well, Jim, I like
the profile of your blade.

16:01.394 --> 16:04.331
The only thing of caution
is these deep pockets.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.765
There's a lot of grinding
to do over here.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.767
Hopefully you can
get rid of that.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.071
You have such great patterns
to show over here.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.172
- Okay, John, you're up.

16:12.205 --> 16:16.409
*

16:16.443 --> 16:18.278
- Well, John,
to be totally honest,

16:18.311 --> 16:19.712
I'm having a hard time

16:19.746 --> 16:21.248
quantifying this
as a finished blade.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.449
- It's not, sir.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.285
- We don't have any profile.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.753
- No, sir.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.322
- The stick weld
is still back here.

16:29.356 --> 16:34.294
I can see that it's layered,
but I can't determine a pattern.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.762
Honestly, we still basically
have a billet here.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.464
- I agree.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.099
- I'm gonna give you
props though.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.433
You swung a hammer
till the very end.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.668
You didn't give up.
- Thank you.

16:41.701 --> 16:45.138
- John, your blade failed

16:45.172 --> 16:47.374
to meet several
of our parameters

16:47.407 --> 16:49.409
and therefore
did not make the cut.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.479
At this time, I have to ask you,
please leave the Forge.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.414
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck, man.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.249
- I brought
the wrong strategies,

16:56.283 --> 16:58.285
the wrong time management.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.120
It's that simple.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.788
I think my grandfather
and my father

17:01.821 --> 17:04.124
would be very proud of me

17:04.157 --> 17:09.229
because I live the kind of life
that they taught me to live.

17:09.262 --> 17:12.765
I'm sorry. It hurts.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.102
- Bladesmiths, you've made it
to the second round

17:15.135 --> 17:16.503
of this competition.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.371
Now it's time
to turn those blades

17:18.405 --> 17:20.640
into fully-functional weapons
by attaching handles

17:20.673 --> 17:24.077
to them using the range of
material provided in our pantry.

17:24.111 --> 17:27.347
You will have three hours
in this round.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.549
You can use that time
to address flaws or issues

17:29.582 --> 17:31.518
that were identified
in your blades,

17:31.551 --> 17:33.586
but when the time runs out,

17:33.620 --> 17:35.555
your blades will be tested
for strength and durability

17:35.588 --> 17:37.390
in an antler chop

17:37.424 --> 17:40.360
and for edge retention
in a beef rib slice.

17:40.393 --> 17:44.831
Good luck, gents.
Your time starts now.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.833
Three hours is a lot of time.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.336
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should see
some really good stuff.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.471
- There's no stipulations
for this round,

17:51.504 --> 17:53.273
so that makes me more nervous

17:53.306 --> 17:55.575
because I have no excuse now

17:55.608 --> 17:59.846
if I can't turn in a knife
without a handle.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.615
The first thing I'm gonna do
is take an inch off the tang

18:02.649 --> 18:04.351
and change the shape
of my handle.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.419
- I think Nate's shortening up
that tang.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.588
- Smart move.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.590
- That'll move his Ricasso
forward, shorten up that space,

18:10.623 --> 18:13.526
and not affect his blade at all.

18:13.560 --> 18:17.564
- Okay, that feels better.
- Richard's getting into it.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.332
He's got, like,
a rhythm to his step.

18:19.366 --> 18:22.269
- That's a lot of steel.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.238
What they pointed out earlier
was a distal taper,

18:25.272 --> 18:26.873
and that's what I'm trying
to put in right now

18:26.906 --> 18:28.641
to get good balance
for swinging.

18:28.675 --> 18:32.245
*

18:32.279 --> 18:35.848
- Jim actually has two really
deep drill holes

18:35.882 --> 18:37.617
that are very close
to each other.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.619
- They're almost on top
of each other.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.921
- Do you think that that creates
a weak point in his blade?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.923
- It could.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.858
- I got a lot of work
to do to address the divots

18:45.892 --> 18:48.295
where I over-drilled the holes.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.931
I need to pay close attention
and not do something stupid,

18:51.964 --> 18:55.168
so I'm gonna use the K.I.S.S.
method in this round.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.936
Keep it simple, stupid.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.572
- One hour has elapsed.
You only have two hours

18:59.606 --> 19:01.874
remaining
to finish those blades.

19:01.908 --> 19:05.378
And we're into the acid.
Now, J.,

19:05.412 --> 19:07.514
do you think that all our smiths

19:07.547 --> 19:10.383
went deep enough to maintain
those raindrop patterns,

19:10.417 --> 19:12.485
or are we gonna lose
a lot of that?

19:12.519 --> 19:14.354
- We've got Jim, who probably
went a little too deep in spots,

19:14.387 --> 19:16.456
so he's got to recover
from that.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.725
Richard nailed it.

19:18.758 --> 19:22.662
My big concern is Nate washing
some of that out at the bottom.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.564
What I'm really hoping is,
we see something more

19:24.597 --> 19:25.932
than a five-minute etch

19:25.965 --> 19:27.934
and really get
that pattern to pop.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.270
The contrast of these
steels is nice.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.505
The 1095 etches nice and dark,

19:32.539 --> 19:34.774
and then you've got the higher
nickel count in the 15N20,

19:34.807 --> 19:36.309
so that actually
gives you the shine

19:36.343 --> 19:38.478
and most Damascus patterns.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.947
- Well, now that I got my blade
into the etching,

19:40.980 --> 19:44.684
the next step
is to pick handle material.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.954
I see a piece of stabilized
pine cone in an acrylic.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.856
The pine cone, the camp knife,

19:49.889 --> 19:51.491
that the judges
would look at that

19:51.524 --> 19:52.892
and see that I had
a theme going.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.594
It's gonna work out great.

19:54.627 --> 19:55.895
- That white pine
cone looks very nice.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.698
- But not
the most stable material.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.000
The center of the fins
of the pine cone

20:01.033 --> 20:02.869
doesn't suck in
any of that polymer.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.572
Sometimes it just snaps
right along that line.

20:05.605 --> 20:09.776
*

20:09.809 --> 20:12.679
- I got most all the issues out.
I got one I can't get out,

20:12.712 --> 20:15.315
so I'm gonna have to go with it.

20:15.348 --> 20:19.319
I have one divot in the back
that if I grind that thing out,

20:19.352 --> 20:21.554
I will have a big dip
in the blade,

20:21.588 --> 20:23.356
and I don't want that.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.292
I would rather
leave the divot in.

20:25.325 --> 20:28.428
It's just ugly.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.364
- Nate allowed his blade
to etch for quite a while.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.366
What did you think
of that pattern?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.735
- He does have the pattern
fading out towards the edge,

20:35.768 --> 20:38.671
but he's got a lot of action
going on up top.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.741
- It's looking good,
so I'm gonna start my handle.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.477
I need a handle that's gonna
support a blade of that size,

20:44.511 --> 20:46.713
so I go with stabilized burl.

20:46.746 --> 20:51.318
With the modification
I made to the Ricasso,

20:51.351 --> 20:53.620
the wood doesn't go up as far
as I would like it to,

20:53.653 --> 20:56.389
but I'll make it work.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.591
- You have just
60 minutes remaining.

20:58.625 --> 21:02.895
- [laughing]
It's like Christmas.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.432
- The pattern in Jim's blade
is very distinct.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.467
- It's neat. It's almost like
a laddered raindrop

21:07.500 --> 21:09.402
'cause there's two drops,
then a middle.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.903
It's like boing,
boing, boing, boing.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.805
It's like a bunny hopping
through a puddle.

21:12.839 --> 21:17.344
*

21:17.377 --> 21:19.446
- I got my handle material,
and I know

21:19.479 --> 21:21.781
it's some kind of plastic,
but it looks like raindrops.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.483
It's going to be pretty.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.918
- So Jim is going to use
reconstituted stone

21:25.952 --> 21:27.587
for his handle scales?

21:27.620 --> 21:29.556
- What does that mean
for Jim's blade?

21:29.589 --> 21:31.324
- It means that he might put
very brittle handle scales

21:31.358 --> 21:33.960
on his beautiful Damascus knife.

21:33.993 --> 21:37.897
- Once I have that pin in,
I can't get the damn thing out.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.767
- On an antler chop,
there's gonna be

21:40.800 --> 21:42.635
so much stress
coming through

21:42.669 --> 21:45.905
that tang, that could
fracture something out.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.741
- Oh!

21:48.775 --> 21:53.079
- [Bleep]. That's not good.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.414
I said
it's very brittle material.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.915
You got to be very careful.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.850
- Okay, do-over.
- Honestly, it's probably

21:57.884 --> 21:59.886
the best thing that could've
happened to him right now.

21:59.919 --> 22:03.423
- Never pick handle material
because it's pretty.

22:03.456 --> 22:06.693
Pick handle material
because it's tough.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.362
I can't afford
another break like this.

22:09.396 --> 22:12.432
I knew I shouldn't have
picked it for the color.

22:12.465 --> 22:15.001
- Richard has done a lot
of shaping on his handle scales.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.803
- Attention to detail

22:16.836 --> 22:19.472
is what separates you
from other artisans.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.007
It's going that extra mile

22:21.040 --> 22:22.975
to make it
really look good for the judges.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.445
Yeah, I like this stuff.
If I polished it out,

22:25.478 --> 22:27.847
that pine cone material
will really pop.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.882
- I would like to see handles

22:29.916 --> 22:32.552
that are contoured beautifully
for your hand

22:32.585 --> 22:34.120
more than I'd like
to see something

22:34.153 --> 22:36.789
that's got a lot of flash to it.

22:36.823 --> 22:39.392
- Less than
five minutes remaining.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.394
- The blade is sharp,

22:41.428 --> 22:44.030
but it feels too heavy.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.932
I feel like if I put
a clip point at the back,

22:45.965 --> 22:47.667
that'll take just a little bit
of weight off of the tip,

22:47.700 --> 22:49.802
and it'll make it
a little more wieldy.

22:49.836 --> 22:54.441
- Man, oh, man.
What is Nate doing right now?

22:54.474 --> 22:56.543
- He's giving me grayer hair.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.479
- Nate's got three minutes
and 40 seconds

22:59.512 --> 23:01.981
to fix all of those grindings
that he's done.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.883
- If Nate doesn't clean this up,

23:03.916 --> 23:06.986
this is an odd
unfinished section of the blade,

23:07.019 --> 23:08.655
and, you know,
that's gonna put him

23:08.688 --> 23:10.156
in big trouble
with these other guys.

23:10.189 --> 23:13.125
- Oh, yeah.
- Jim is going over to,

23:13.159 --> 23:15.428
like, red Micarta,
which is very tough.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.464
- Yeah.
- He's back on track.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.632
- Watching Jim hold onto it,

23:19.666 --> 23:22.535
I think this is gonna be one
of the nicer contoured handles.

23:22.569 --> 23:26.105
- Oh! Still got all
your fingers over there?

23:26.138 --> 23:27.874
All right.

23:27.907 --> 23:32.612
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

23:32.645 --> 23:37.750
five, four, three, two, one.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.486
Bladesmiths, shut down
your machines.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.854
This round is over.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.723
- I'm very happy
I put in a clip.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.157
It feels good in the hand,

23:45.191 --> 23:49.529
and I was able
to make the handle.

23:49.562 --> 23:53.165
- Welcome to the strength test,
the dreaded antler chop.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.468
I'm gonna take
each of your knives.

23:55.502 --> 23:58.037
I'm gonna deliver
six devastating blows.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.507
It's gonna test the edge
retention of your blades.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.808
This is not about
what your knives

24:01.841 --> 24:03.876
are gonna do to the antler.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.045
It's about what the antler
is gonna do to your knives.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.747
All right, Nate, you ready?

24:07.780 --> 24:09.115
- I'm ready.
- All right, let's do it.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.818
*

24:11.851 --> 24:13.753
- It's very hard to chop
an antler

24:13.786 --> 24:15.221
and keep any kind of an edge.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.624
Antler is mostly mineral.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.592
You're cutting through rocks.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.828
That is making me very nervous.

24:21.861 --> 24:28.768
*

24:31.938 --> 24:33.239
- Wow.

24:33.272 --> 24:36.275
*

24:36.308 --> 24:38.110
- Good job, man.
- Wow.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.112
- Nate, very nice job
on the blade.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.681
- Thank you.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.115
- You got a couple
little wrinkles.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.251
- Okay.
- Everything stayed tight.

24:45.284 --> 24:48.087
I have to tell you, though,
I hate this handle.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.689
- Yeah.
- You need more handle

24:49.722 --> 24:51.190
with such a big,
heavy blade like this.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.992
If it wasn't for that lanyard,

24:53.025 --> 24:55.294
this knife would've
been out of my hand.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.129
That's a problem.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.098
- Okay.
- What are you thinking, Jim?

24:59.131 --> 25:00.132
- I'm thinking I'm next.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.569
[laughter]

25:02.602 --> 25:06.606
I have that solid piece of steel
down the center for my blade,

25:06.639 --> 25:08.775
so I'm hoping that maybe mine

25:08.808 --> 25:11.578
will hold up a little better
in the antler chop.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.112
[exhales heavily]

25:13.145 --> 25:20.086
*

25:22.354 --> 25:23.723
Argh!

25:26.926 --> 25:32.565
*

25:32.599 --> 25:33.800
I never thought
there was

25:33.833 --> 25:36.769
a possibility of it breaking.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.271
- Got a little bit of
a problem here, Jim.

25:39.305 --> 25:43.275
Looking right at your spine
here, a seam opened up,

25:43.309 --> 25:45.845
and you can see,
that seam led to a weak point.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.981
It opened that up enough to
actually blow this knife apart.

25:49.015 --> 25:52.952
It felt very comfortable
in the hand, though.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.054
You ready, Richard?
- I'm ready.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.356
When I see
Jim's blade break,

25:57.389 --> 25:59.992
that just adds
to the worries of mine.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.228
If a knife as strong
as his broke,

26:02.261 --> 26:03.830
it could happen to mine next.

26:03.863 --> 26:13.706
*

26:19.946 --> 26:21.948
- Very nice job, Richard.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.617
I don't see any wrinkles.

26:24.651 --> 26:26.052
This is very
pretty handle material,

26:26.085 --> 26:27.754
but it's a little
on the slick side.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.156
Some texturing would've
been a nice touch.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.858
But nice job.

26:31.891 --> 26:35.928
- Appreciate it.
- Jim, an imperfection

26:35.962 --> 26:38.898
in your steel led
to catastrophic blade failure,

26:38.931 --> 26:41.768
and your blade
did not make the cut.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.103
Sir, I'm afraid I have to ask
you to please leave the Forge.

26:44.136 --> 26:48.207
Thank you.

26:48.240 --> 26:52.779
- I have a whole new respect
for what goes on here.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.781
I had an enjoyable time.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.215
I have two new friends now,

26:56.248 --> 26:58.117
and I wish them both
the best of luck.

26:58.150 --> 27:02.321
*

27:02.354 --> 27:04.323
- Nate, Richard,
congratulations.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.893
You guys have made it into the
final round of this competition,

27:06.926 --> 27:09.395
which means that you're both one
step closer to the title

27:09.428 --> 27:13.399
of "Forged in Fire" Champion
and a check for $10,000.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.234
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

27:15.267 --> 27:18.104
to re-create an iconic
weapon from history.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.372
That weapon is...

27:20.406 --> 27:22.709
the kpinga.

27:22.742 --> 27:25.044
[both laughing]

27:25.077 --> 27:27.680
The kpinga is a throwing knife
used in warfare

27:27.714 --> 27:29.882
by the Azande people
of Central Africa.

27:29.916 --> 27:32.351
Soldiers carried these lethal
weapons inside large shields

27:32.384 --> 27:34.453
that could house up
to four at a time,

27:34.486 --> 27:36.956
allowing them to be brandished
at a moment's notice.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.758
Three sharp blades protruding

27:38.791 --> 27:40.927
at different angles
inflicted brutal injury

27:40.960 --> 27:43.796
and made these deadly
projectiles difficult to evade.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.933
Upon attack, the weapon
was thrown in a vertical arc

27:46.966 --> 27:49.836
or in a low, sweeping arc
to sever the nearest limb.

27:49.869 --> 27:53.472
The kpinga was so impressive,
it became a symbol of power,

27:53.505 --> 27:57.710
and to this day is carried
only by select nobility.

27:57.744 --> 28:00.279
- It's this pointy,
crazy-looking thing.

28:00.312 --> 28:03.182
I have never made
anything like this.

28:03.215 --> 28:06.819
- A kpinga. What?
It's got me scratching my head.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.788
- It must be an effective,
working version

28:08.821 --> 28:10.156
of that deadly weapon.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.024
Your blade must include
a handle,

28:12.058 --> 28:14.861
a spur, and two primary blades.

28:14.894 --> 28:18.464
The tip of the upper blade
must be sharpened on both sides.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.132
You will have five days
at your home forge

28:20.166 --> 28:22.068
to complete this challenge.

28:22.101 --> 28:24.236
After five days, you will return
and present your weapons

28:24.270 --> 28:26.072
to our panel of expert judges,

28:26.105 --> 28:27.406
and only after
they've submitted them

28:27.439 --> 28:29.475
to a series of brutal tests

28:29.508 --> 28:32.011
will they declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion

28:32.044 --> 28:34.280
who also leaves
with a check for 10 grand.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.415
Good luck.
We'll see you in five days.

28:36.448 --> 28:41.053
*

28:41.087 --> 28:44.090
- I made it to the final round.
I am very excited.

28:44.123 --> 28:47.059
A kpinga looks complicated.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.028
It looks like a pickaxe

28:49.061 --> 28:52.131
with a couple of throwing knives
stuck off the handle.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.266
My strategy here
is to figure out

28:54.300 --> 28:56.869
what part needs to go where.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.537
I got to narrow the handle area

28:58.570 --> 29:00.006
before I start
spreading everything out.

29:00.039 --> 29:03.042
I need some bend here.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.477
This thing is like an octopus.

29:05.511 --> 29:07.313
There's arms everywhere
to catch on stuff.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.448
It's so hard to work on one arm

29:09.481 --> 29:12.318
without the other arm
getting in the way.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.353
At this point in my life,

29:14.386 --> 29:16.989
I don't want bladesmithing
to become a hobby again.

29:17.023 --> 29:20.192
Competing is my way
of making sure that happens.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.961
Bend this back
a little bit more.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.363
I noticed that Richard
has frightening ability,

29:24.396 --> 29:26.065
and I got to keep my head
in the game

29:26.098 --> 29:27.934
the whole time
if I expect to win.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.201
I got no room for error.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.236
Wow.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.504
*

29:32.538 --> 29:34.874
- I'm so excited
to be representing Texas.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.375
That really is big for me.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.077
I want to win this
for all of us.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.047
I stole modeling clay
from my kids.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.982
They're not gonna be happy.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.017
So this crazy kpinga,
nobody makes these.

29:45.051 --> 29:47.153
I think that my metallurgy
background

29:47.186 --> 29:49.956
is gonna give me
the advantage over Nate.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.458
I think I'm gonna end up getting
a lot of length on the handle,

29:52.491 --> 29:54.827
bending this guy, bend this guy.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.529
There's a kpinga
in this big old hunk of stuff.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.598
Anytime you take steel,
and you bend it,

29:59.631 --> 30:02.068
with every action,
there's a reaction.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.871
It's compressing on one side,
elongating another.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.438
A lot of stress
going into those joints.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.407
Nate is an awesome smith,

30:08.440 --> 30:10.309
and I know he's bringing
his A game as well.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.911
It's starting to take
a little bit more shape.

30:11.944 --> 30:14.446
*

30:14.480 --> 30:17.283
- I have the shape
to the kpinga complete.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.551
I have to do
a lot of grinding today.

30:19.585 --> 30:22.554
I'm trying to get in here
and in here.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.857
I can't get all the angles

30:24.891 --> 30:27.026
that I want to because
of the shape of the weapon,

30:27.059 --> 30:29.395
so I am taking
creative liberties

30:29.428 --> 30:31.931
in how to grind this kpinga.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.900
Whoa.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.402
It's just a tricky blade
to grind,

30:36.435 --> 30:39.505
totally different
from the ordinary blades.

30:39.538 --> 30:43.109
You got to be careful.

30:43.142 --> 30:46.645
Now I have some
very fine artwork to do.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.580
Understanding
exactly the texture

30:48.614 --> 30:51.050
that I want here
is going to determine

30:51.083 --> 30:53.652
what kind of chisel
I need to use.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.956
Just heat this up a little bit.

30:56.989 --> 30:59.191
The technique that I'm going
to be using for engraving

30:59.225 --> 31:01.393
is based on Japanese metalwork,

31:01.427 --> 31:05.998
and they used pine tar to secure
their metal to a work table.

31:06.032 --> 31:09.201
I don't have any pine resin,
so I used hot glue.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.270
This cannot be done while tense.

31:11.303 --> 31:16.575
*

31:16.608 --> 31:19.011
The patterns I have added
to this really

31:19.045 --> 31:22.148
give this piece more
historical accuracy.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.650
These were more than just
simple throwing knives.

31:24.683 --> 31:27.419
Azandes believed that these
were symbols of warriorship,

31:27.453 --> 31:29.488
and they were highly revered.

31:29.521 --> 31:32.158
So I'm very proud that
the design is hand-chiseled.

31:32.191 --> 31:33.459
I think it looks spectacular.

31:33.492 --> 31:36.162
Perfect.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.197
- I'm really happy with where
I'm at at this point.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.666
So it's time to he-treat.

31:40.699 --> 31:43.169
It may snap right here.
There's so many different areas.

31:43.202 --> 31:45.237
This is a long blade.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.173
I'm thinking,
"How am I gonna heat-treat it?"

31:47.206 --> 31:50.509
I have to heat the whole blade
evenly and then quench.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.312
This is for $10,000.
This has got to be right.

31:53.345 --> 31:56.682
[Bleep], it doesn't fit.

31:56.715 --> 32:00.386
If I can't get that
blade heated, it's not a blade.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.089
If I stuck it in there like that
and took the torch

32:03.122 --> 32:04.590
and heated that guy
at the same time,

32:04.623 --> 32:07.626
pull it off, boom.
I can do that.

32:07.659 --> 32:10.629
*

32:10.662 --> 32:13.265
So I have the bigger blade
in the forge.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.701
I'm heating up the part
that's sticking out.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.069
You know, there's so
many different things

32:17.103 --> 32:18.670
that can go wrong.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.306
If this works,
it is gonna be a miracle.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.074
Come on.

32:27.646 --> 32:29.481
I've got no other options.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.749
It's got to be done today.

32:30.782 --> 32:35.287
Hard. Hard.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.489
All of it got hard.
I am very happy.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.993
I was wound up tight about this.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.561
- I am feeling a little urgency

32:42.594 --> 32:44.730
because I have three things
to get done today:

32:44.763 --> 32:46.598
heat-treating the blade,

32:46.632 --> 32:50.069
put on the handle,
and then sharpen it.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.738
The heat treat goes swimmingly.
There's no warping.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.773
So the handle,

32:54.806 --> 32:57.409
I'm gonna try out something
I've never done before.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.511
I'm gonna use a braid.

32:59.545 --> 33:02.381
I chose goatskin because
it's excellent for braiding.

33:02.414 --> 33:05.617
It's very strong and very thin.
You got to love leather.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.287
The last thing
I'm adding to the handle

33:08.320 --> 33:10.089
is a wax called saddle soap.

33:10.122 --> 33:12.291
Goop it on and wipe off
the excess.

33:12.324 --> 33:15.227
This is just to protect
the leather and to give it

33:15.261 --> 33:18.730
a little bit more of
a comfortable grip.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.467
There's just so much
energy in the air

33:21.500 --> 33:23.035
that it actually
started to hail.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.770
I think this is a good omen.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.738
I'm bringing something
deadly into this world.

33:26.772 --> 33:29.208
This is the birth
of something great.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.410
*

33:31.443 --> 33:35.647
- It's the last day. This is the
biggest handle I've ever done,

33:35.681 --> 33:38.350
so it's got to be strong
because if this hits wrong,

33:38.384 --> 33:40.519
I don't want it to break off,

33:40.552 --> 33:44.123
and I don't want the judges
to complain about my handle.

33:44.156 --> 33:45.724
You know they're gonna
throw this thing,

33:45.757 --> 33:47.659
so I've got to get it
shaped correctly.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.561
It's got to be balanced.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.463
All right,
it's starting to feel good.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.299
The handles are shaping up.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.567
This knife that I built
is Texas tough,

33:55.601 --> 33:57.069
and I am very proud
of what I did.

33:57.103 --> 34:02.508
*

34:02.541 --> 34:04.576
- Well, gentlemen,
let's get this party started.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.412
Nate, tell us about your weapon.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.747
- I went with more
of a traditional style.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.682
I used a leather braid
for the handle.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.384
I engraved some symbols
that I found

34:12.418 --> 34:14.620
from the Azande warrior shield,

34:14.653 --> 34:15.854
and every single one
of those blades

34:15.887 --> 34:17.856
can stick pretty well, so...

34:17.889 --> 34:20.492
- All right. Richard,
tell us about your weapon.

34:20.526 --> 34:24.230
- My kpinga is made out of 5160,
and I kind of went

34:24.263 --> 34:26.332
with more of a modern approach,

34:26.365 --> 34:28.367
and I'm ready to get started.
I want to see what it does.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.137
- Your weapons look fantastic,
but can they fly?

34:31.170 --> 34:32.571
We'll now be putting
your weapons

34:32.604 --> 34:34.573
through a series of three tests.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.809
Up first, the kill test. Doug.

34:37.843 --> 34:41.313
- Bladesmiths, the kpinga is
made to be a throwing weapon.

34:41.347 --> 34:42.814
With so much blade, I wonder

34:42.848 --> 34:44.783
what kind of lethal damage
it's gonna do.

34:44.816 --> 34:46.218
Nate, you're up first.
You ready?

34:46.252 --> 34:48.287
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.422
- Now the seriousness
is starting to hit me,

34:50.456 --> 34:51.757
and I'm getting
a little bit of adrenaline,

34:51.790 --> 34:53.225
getting a little nervous.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.660
It could rotate the wrong way

34:54.693 --> 34:56.428
and hit by the handle,
not stick at all.

34:56.462 --> 35:03.435
*

35:04.670 --> 35:05.737
- [whispering] Wow.

35:05.771 --> 35:12.744
*

35:17.549 --> 35:18.817
- All right, Nate.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.587
It feels good when you throw it.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.523
The penetration
of your blade is so deep.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.858
That will hit vital organs.

35:26.892 --> 35:30.662
This is definitely
the back scratcher of death.

35:30.696 --> 35:34.733
This weapon will kill.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.268
Richard, you're next.
You ready?

35:36.302 --> 35:37.336
- Let's do it.

35:37.369 --> 35:44.343
*

35:44.376 --> 35:45.377
Awesome.

35:45.411 --> 35:52.318
*

35:56.255 --> 35:58.824
Wow.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.393
- Well, Richard,
when you throw it,

36:01.427 --> 36:04.363
it's got good balance
for forward momentum,

36:04.396 --> 36:07.299
enough to penetrate
into the carcass.

36:07.333 --> 36:10.802
Overall, your weapon will kill.
Good job.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.938
- Thank you.
Five days of work on this.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.707
Seeing it bury that way and spin
in there the way it did,

36:15.741 --> 36:17.509
oh, it feels great.

36:17.543 --> 36:18.910
- All right, gentlemen,
to test the strength

36:18.944 --> 36:20.646
and durability of your kpingas,

36:20.679 --> 36:22.448
I'll be throwing them
into our log wall

36:22.481 --> 36:24.750
three times each weapon.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.585
Nate, you're up first.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.987
- I have one concern,
and that is,

36:29.020 --> 36:31.223
I know that they're gonna be
throwing it a lot harder

36:31.257 --> 36:32.791
specifically to see

36:32.824 --> 36:34.826
if any part of it
is going to bend or break.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.762
That part is what
I'm most nervous about.

36:36.795 --> 36:43.735
*

37:04.623 --> 37:06.458
- So, Nate, your handle

37:06.492 --> 37:09.728
is really beautifully done,
but it's sticky.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.663
- Yeah.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.899
- That first throw,
instead of releasing here,

37:13.932 --> 37:16.302
I released all
the way down here,

37:16.335 --> 37:18.937
and it just was stuck
in my hand.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.340
Having said that,
it buried itself

37:21.373 --> 37:23.375
in that wood quite beautifully.

37:23.409 --> 37:24.843
- Okay.
- Nicely done.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.512
- Thank you.
- All right, Richard.

37:26.545 --> 37:29.648
- Let's do it.
I see these log walls.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.450
This is my biggest fear

37:31.483 --> 37:33.285
because I've never done type
of heat treat

37:33.319 --> 37:35.053
with multiple points like this.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.855
My biggest fear is one of those
tips breaking off.

37:36.888 --> 37:43.862
*

37:53.405 --> 37:54.640
Whew.

37:54.673 --> 37:58.377
Wow.

37:58.410 --> 38:01.513
- All right, so let's talk about
the design of your weapon.

38:01.547 --> 38:05.384
The way your blades are spread
out seems a bit wide.

38:05.417 --> 38:09.521
If this blade were here,
it would be traveling forward,

38:09.555 --> 38:10.922
as opposed to down.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.091
But I think, for me,
the biggest issue

38:13.124 --> 38:17.363
is the longer handle is really
increasing my rotation.

38:17.396 --> 38:19.665
I do like the shape
of your handle.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.767
It comes out of the hand
quite nicely,

38:21.800 --> 38:25.070
and everything's still right
and tight. Well done.

38:25.103 --> 38:27.439
- Thank you.
Man, I'm just relieved.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.475
It stuck deeper than Nate's.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.910
It stuck almost the full length
of the longest spike.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.813
- All right, gentlemen, to test
the sharpness of your blades

38:34.846 --> 38:36.548
I'll be throwing them
into our canvas

38:36.582 --> 38:39.418
sandbag wall here two times.

38:39.451 --> 38:40.986
Nate, once again
you're up first. You ready?

38:41.019 --> 38:42.954
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.623
- I'm most nervous
about the sharpness test.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.458
I don't know if the edges

38:46.492 --> 38:48.093
are gonna hold after
all the strength tests.

38:48.126 --> 38:50.095
We're not being asked to cut
a pair of jeans.

38:50.128 --> 38:57.035
*

39:06.412 --> 39:09.615
- So, Nate, it punctures
the bag like it's not there.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.650
I like the positioning
of your blades,

39:11.683 --> 39:13.852
but what's nice
is this short handle.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.588
You're gonna not have
as much to catch

39:16.622 --> 39:18.490
coming over the top
on a rotation.

39:18.524 --> 39:20.626
That's a big plus
in a thrown weapon.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.093
Well done. It's a good thrower.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.663
- Thank you.
- Richard, you ready?

39:24.696 --> 39:27.966
- Yes, sir.
I know my kpinga is sharp.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.602
My biggest fear is that it
doesn't cut as well as Nate's.

39:30.636 --> 39:32.037
We're neck and neck
at this point.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.905
Mine has to cut
as good as Nate's.

39:33.939 --> 39:40.912
*

39:52.724 --> 39:55.193
- Again, the positioning
of your blades sets it up

39:55.226 --> 39:57.028
for a different rotation,

39:57.062 --> 39:58.964
and I need to adjust
to throw this weapon,

39:58.997 --> 40:01.032
but it's definitely
a sharp weapon.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.901
It went right through the bag.
It's a good job.

40:02.934 --> 40:05.971
- Thank you.
- Nate, Richard,

40:06.004 --> 40:08.206
through three grueling
rounds of competition,

40:08.239 --> 40:09.875
you've worked your britches off

40:09.908 --> 40:13.178
to be standing right here
in this moment,

40:13.211 --> 40:16.648
and for that,
we respect you as craftsmen.

40:16.682 --> 40:19.217
*

40:19.250 --> 40:21.052
However, in this arena
of competition,

40:21.086 --> 40:23.522
there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion.

40:23.555 --> 40:29.895
*

40:29.928 --> 40:31.730
Nate, congratulations.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.799
You are the "Forged
in Fire" champion.

40:33.832 --> 40:37.469
Richard, unfortunately your
blade did not make the cut.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.505
- Richard, you brought us
a deadly weapon

40:39.538 --> 40:41.106
that was strong and sharp,

40:41.139 --> 40:43.775
but with that long handle
and the arrangement

40:43.809 --> 40:46.612
of your blades,
it was just harder to control.

40:46.645 --> 40:48.213
- I understand.

40:48.246 --> 40:51.149
- Richard, please surrender
your weapon.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.018
- Richard, thank you.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.686
- The judges made
the right choice.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.154
I would've made
the same choice myself.

40:56.187 --> 40:58.156
I have absolutely zero regrets.

40:58.189 --> 41:01.693
This was a fantastic experience.
The judges were fantastic.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.662
- Good job, buddy.
You know, David,

41:03.695 --> 41:05.664
he must be a brother
from another mother.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.065
I've got a few fashion tips
that I'm gonna share

41:07.098 --> 41:09.501
with him later on
before I leave.

41:09.535 --> 41:10.769
I'm ready to get back to Texas.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.705
*

41:13.739 --> 41:17.142
- Nate, congratulations. You are
the "Forged in Fire" champion,

41:17.175 --> 41:20.011
and that's a title that comes
with a check for $10,000.

41:20.045 --> 41:23.815
Good job, brother.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.551
How you feeling right now?

41:25.584 --> 41:27.753
- I'm feeling great. Thank you.

41:27.786 --> 41:30.522
- Please present your kpinga
to the judges.

41:30.556 --> 41:32.090
- I can't believe it.

41:32.123 --> 41:34.760
Being a full-time bladesmith
is my dream.

41:34.793 --> 41:37.829
That future looks a little
more bright, and that feels wow.
