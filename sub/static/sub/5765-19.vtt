Previously on The Good Wife...
The transmitter is
to be worn around

00:03.170 --> 00:04.569
your ankle
at all times.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.591
You're confined to the
apartment 24 hours a day.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.767
It must not
cross this line.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.165
Your condition is your...

00:10.210 --> 00:12.132
There is no condition!

00:12.180 --> 00:13.670
I'll be damned
if I'm going to have

00:13.710 --> 00:16.645
people think that Jonas Stern
is losing his mind.

00:16.680 --> 00:17.772
You've done wrong.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.141
I know I have.

00:19.180 --> 00:20.147
Your marriage
is in trouble

00:20.180 --> 00:23.047
because you don't acknowledge
true repentance.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.341
Tell me what I have to do.

00:24.390 --> 00:26.483
I'm going to take a
third of your business,

00:26.520 --> 00:29.250
and then I'm coming
back for the rest.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.660
OPPOSING LAWYER:
"At 5:16 pm. on September 5,
the explosion hit.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.565
"It was felt
over four blocks away.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.830
"Federal investigators
determined it was a pipe bomb

00:43.310 --> 00:45.130
"and anhydrous
hydrazine nitrate,

00:45.170 --> 00:46.376
"which had been thrown
through the window

00:48.710 --> 00:49.904
"No culprits
were ever apprehended,

00:49.950 --> 00:53.272
"and the federal government
continues to investigate.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.673
"The explosion killed
the plaintiff

00:54.720 --> 00:56.813
"Mr. Jeffrey Sanborn, 42,

00:56.850 --> 00:59.080
managing editor
of the Cook County Vindicator."

00:59.120 --> 01:00.348
JULIU_S:
Exception.

01:00.390 --> 01:02.722
"Resulted in his death."

01:02.760 --> 01:05.854
Uh, noted and accepted.

01:05.890 --> 01:08.859
Replacing "killed."

01:08.900 --> 01:09.924
"Mr. Sanborn is married

01:09.970 --> 01:12.131
"and has two teenaged
dependents who will suffer

01:12.170 --> 01:14.263
"from loss of wages
and affection.

01:16.670 --> 01:19.468
and severally, agree to pay..."
Uh, Julius?

01:19.510 --> 01:24.174
"$250,000 from capped
business insurance

01:24.210 --> 01:27.577
and $100,000 from capped
renter's insurance."

01:27.620 --> 01:30.111
But only if we agree now.

01:30.150 --> 01:31.310
We agree.

01:31.350 --> 01:34.148
Mrs. Sanborn?

01:34.190 --> 01:36.454
Mrs. Sanborn?

01:37.490 --> 01:41.221
The man_
you're discussmg--

01:41.260 --> 01:42.124
my husband--

01:42.170 --> 01:44.195
he was working
on a novel.

01:44.230 --> 01:45.561
I just started
reading it.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.536
It's... beautiful.

01:50.570 --> 01:52.902
And you're telling me

01:52.940 --> 01:58.139
that he's worth
$350,000?

02:00.250 --> 02:05.142
Mrs. Sanborn, no money could
ever replace your husband,

02:05.190 --> 02:07.658
but the only way
we can talk here

02:07.690 --> 02:09.624
is about money.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.184
I'm sorry.

02:11.230 --> 02:14.927
I've been reading a lot
of books about grief,

02:14.960 --> 02:17.190
and they all suggest
waiting six months

02:17.230 --> 02:19.767
before you make
any big changes in your life.

02:19.800 --> 02:23.201
Well, Jeffrey died
exactly

02:23.240 --> 02:26.437
six months ago
this week, so...

02:26.480 --> 02:28.436
you're fired...

02:28.480 --> 02:30.903
and you are, too.

02:30.950 --> 02:35.273
Mrs. Sanborn, if you do this,
we have to start over,

02:35.320 --> 02:37.709
and you may not get a better
settlement from our client.

02:37.750 --> 02:38.910
I think I will.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.180
Why?

02:41.220 --> 02:42.255
Why do you think that?

02:42.290 --> 02:44.383
Because I just hired
a new lawyer.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.488
(elevator bell dings)

02:45.530 --> 02:47.828
Jeanette!
Oh!

02:47.860 --> 02:50.829
Oh, how I missed you, baby doll.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.792
Ah, good to see you.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.833
Hey, get out of this hellhole,
come work for a real law firm.

02:56.870 --> 02:57.939
I have arrived.

02:57.970 --> 03:00.973
Mr. Stern,
thank you for joining us.

03:01.010 --> 03:05.276
Mrs. Sanborn, it is an extreme
and unconditional pleasure.

03:07.650 --> 03:09.288
Hello, Julius.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.209
I see you haven't
taken down the "S" yet.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.682
We're looking for a new Stern.

03:13.720 --> 03:14.948
Coffee, two sugars.

03:14.990 --> 03:15.809
Thanks.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.487
How about you three?
Anybody want coffee?

03:17.530 --> 03:18.781
(chuckles)

03:18.830 --> 03:20.491
Ah, it'll just
be one coffee.

03:20.530 --> 03:23.226
How are you feeling, Mr. Stern?

03:24.270 --> 03:26.488
How am I feeling, huh?

03:26.540 --> 03:30.408
Well, I'm feeling
like amending a complaint.

03:30.440 --> 03:31.998
How does
that sound?
Jonas,

03:32.040 --> 03:34.736
the insurance has been
capped at $350,000.

03:34.780 --> 03:36.577
The newspaper can't
pay anymore.

03:36.610 --> 03:39.249
Llnless_it was
an Intentional act.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.542
Intentional act
opens you up

03:40.580 --> 03:42.389
to punitive damages.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.684
I love when she
talks like that.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.688
It sounds so good coming
from a young person.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.585
How is it
an intentional act?

03:50.430 --> 03:52.853
Your client published

03:52.900 --> 03:55.425
an editorial cartoon
which depicts

03:55.460 --> 03:57.291
the Prophet Muhammad
being humiliated.

03:57.330 --> 04:00.037
Being body scanned
at an airport metal detector.

04:00.070 --> 04:03.005
And while all the other white
passengers are waved through.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.565
It was intended to criticize
raCIal profiling.

04:05.610 --> 04:07.498
All the while,
your client knew

04:07.540 --> 04:09.007
that Islam prohibits

04:09.040 --> 04:11.474
any pictorial depiction
of the Prophet,

04:11.510 --> 04:13.910
and he cut _back
on security

04:13.950 --> 04:15.474
at the exact moment
he should have increased it.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.885
A cost-cutting measure.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.148
Read the settlement,
Jonas.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.681
You know what happened in
Denmark when the Morning Post

04:20.720 --> 04:23.052
published cartoons
just like this.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.455
Riots,

04:24.490 --> 04:25.559
death threats.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.854
This isn't
about Mrs. Sanborn, Jonas.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.322
This is about us.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.589
Of course it's about us.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.631
I'm going to
destroy your firm.

04:35.870 --> 04:37.428
And Mrs. Sanborn

04:37.470 --> 04:39.904
understands that,
don't you, dear?

04:39.940 --> 04:41.339
I do.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.545
How much are you suing for?

04:44.580 --> 04:46.673
Didn't I ask for coffee?

04:46.720 --> 04:47.846
How much in punitive?

04:48.880 --> 04:51.087
$25 million.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.657
Here's the
amended suit.

04:53.690 --> 04:55.681
Mrs. Florrick.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.729
May I have a moment?

05:01.830 --> 05:03.422
How am I feeling?

05:03.470 --> 05:06.530
_ It was _
an Innocent question.

05:06.570 --> 05:08.538
Attorney-client privilege.

05:08.570 --> 05:12.734
What you know about me, what
you know about my condition

05:12.780 --> 05:15.431
is for us to know
and no one else.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.674
You do understand that?

05:18.410 --> 05:21.049
Oh, there it is again.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.047
(chuckles)

05:22.080 --> 05:23.240
That poker face.

05:23.290 --> 05:26.384
You know, I always thought
the CIA could learn something

05:26.420 --> 05:27.717
from the suburban
housewife.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.079
Do you understand?

05:29.120 --> 05:30.087
I understand

05:30.130 --> 05:32.121
the obligations of my job.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.458
Good.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.432
Oh, has your friend Will Gardner

05:39.470 --> 05:40.664
stabbed you in
the back yet?

05:40.700 --> 05:41.928
Would you like me
to get him

05:41.970 --> 05:43.506
on the phone for you?
You can ask.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.373
Ask him who he's
meeting with right now.

05:46.410 --> 05:48.469
Or does the name
Gerald Kozko

05:48.510 --> 05:50.649
mean anything
to you?

05:50.680 --> 05:51.977
He's a real estate developer.

05:52.010 --> 05:53.409
Underwater,

05:53.450 --> 05:56.749
and unless I'm mistaken,
his name keeps coming up

05:56.790 --> 05:58.781
_ in connection
With your husband's case.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.482
Always a pleasure,
Mrs. Florrick.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.530
(men laughing)

06:15.470 --> 06:17.665
Well, it's never
about the money.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.735
It's always about
something else.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.133
Well, I'm sorry
we can't help.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.375
Take care.

06:24.810 --> 06:26.778
Mrs. Florrick.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.617
Mister. . .?

06:28.650 --> 06:29.617
Kozko, Gerald.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.448
We've never met.

06:32.490 --> 06:33.957
How's Peter?

06:33.990 --> 06:35.116
Fine.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.149
I didn't know
you knew Will.

06:36.190 --> 06:37.122
I don't; I
was shopping

06:37.160 --> 06:40.027
for more lavwers to
join my defense team,

06:40.060 --> 06:42.767
but it appears we have
a conflict of interest--

06:42.800 --> 06:44.199
you.

06:44.230 --> 06:47.063
Aanay, glad
to meet you.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.193
Peter always said
he was a lucky guy.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.936
Now I see why.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.631
Would you tell Peter
something for me?

06:55.680 --> 06:57.841
Tell him I'm sorry.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.814
For?

06:59.850 --> 07:02.512
He'll know what I mean.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.779
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

07:22.540 --> 07:23.564
MAN: My great-grandfather
Lucius Clay

07:23.610 --> 07:25.737
founded the Vindicator.

07:25.770 --> 07:27.829
In his ﬁrst editorial
he endorsed Abraham Lincoln.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.179
In his last he railed
against Prohibition.

07:31.210 --> 07:32.575
The Trib and the Sun-Times

07:32.620 --> 07:34.144
may be bigger,

07:34.180 --> 07:36.045
but they have to answer
to corporate ownership.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.048
Dumbwaiters.

07:38.090 --> 07:40.012
Lucius set them up

07:40.060 --> 07:41.584
to shuttle in the booze.

07:41.620 --> 07:43.224
And so we gladly admit that

07:43.260 --> 07:44.750
we have committed this attack

07:44.790 --> 07:45.757
upon the blasphemous,

07:45.790 --> 07:46.927
who published this cartoon,

07:46.960 --> 07:47.949
to defend the honor

07:48.000 --> 07:48.955
of all Muslims

07:49.000 --> 07:50.262
and of Allah's beloved prophet.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.790
Peace be upon him.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.229
Yes, I've seen this.

07:53.270 --> 07:54.635
How does it hurt us?

07:54.670 --> 07:55.864
The plaintiff says
it's no secret

07:55.900 --> 07:57.538
this group's been active
in Chicago.

07:57.570 --> 07:58.662
Six months earlier,
they committed

07:58.710 --> 08:00.905
an identical bombing
at a synagogue.

08:00.940 --> 08:03.545
And you had to know that
cartoon might provoke them.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.047
My job is to provoke.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.069
Because it
sells papers?

08:06.110 --> 08:07.077
Because freedom
of the press

08:07.120 --> 08:10.544
is meaningless unless
somebody actually uses it.

08:12.590 --> 08:15.218
I'm not trying
to be insensitive.

08:15.260 --> 08:17.023
Jeff Sanborn was
a very good friend.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.550
We came up
together.

08:18.590 --> 08:20.228
The problem, Mr. Clay,
is their argument is,

08:20.260 --> 08:21.921
you did it
to increase circulation.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.269
It's not like I commissioned
this cartoon,

08:24.300 --> 08:26.268
hoping it was going
to anger Muslims.

08:26.300 --> 08:29.758
We had an online contest-: best
political cartoon, any subject.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.539
And you picked
the cartoon?

08:31.570 --> 08:33.629
In consultation with my editors.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.137
Jeffrey Sanborn, too?

08:36.180 --> 08:37.306
Sure,

08:37.350 --> 08:38.874
of course.

08:38.910 --> 08:41.014
JULIUS:
So, even if Stern can show

08:41.050 --> 08:42.608
he intended
this to happen,

08:42.650 --> 08:44.208
Sanborn was_
contributorlly negligent.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.217
Might not be a total win,

08:45.250 --> 08:47.013
but it's enough to get us
back to the table.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.982
We'll need something more
than Mr. Clay's testimony

08:49.020 --> 08:49.987
to establish it.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.554
What about
the cartoonist?

08:51.590 --> 08:52.750
It was an anonymous
submission.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.597
I sent the money
to a Paypal account.

08:54.630 --> 08:55.756
Routed through a proxy.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.994
There's no way
to trace it.

08:57.030 --> 08:58.964
We'll see.
I'll get Kalinda on it.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.036
*

09:01.070 --> 09:03.061
(laughter and chatter)

09:05.070 --> 09:07.072
(giggling)

09:09.710 --> 09:11.849
Returning to the
scene of the crime?

09:11.880 --> 09:13.711
You're not going
to pout, are you?

09:13.750 --> 09:16.878
I hate when men pout.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.138
Go away.

09:22.190 --> 09:24.750
Okay, let's inspect the
level of coincidence here.

09:24.790 --> 09:26.621
I haven't seen you
since college.

09:26.660 --> 09:27.888
We bump into
each other here.

09:27.930 --> 09:28.749
You ask me what I'm doing.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.825
I talk about the
Muhammad cartoon case,

09:30.870 --> 09:32.167
and then the next
day-- lo and behold--

09:32.200 --> 09:34.168
you and your firm
are suing my client.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.339
Cary, think about it.

09:36.370 --> 09:38.804
IfI let slip a piece
of information like that to you,

09:38.840 --> 09:42.173
you'd be on the phone to your
boss before our second drink.

09:42.210 --> 09:44.644
Okay.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.075
Then your turn.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.109
What's going
on at work?

09:50.150 --> 09:51.378
(laughs)

09:51.420 --> 09:54.753
Okay, I'll play.

09:54.790 --> 09:55.814
Stern wants you.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.725
Stern wants me?

09:57.760 --> 09:59.387
Last night you wanted
me, now he wants me.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.398
Lockhart, Gardner
is going under.

10:01.430 --> 10:03.796
It's a hollowed-out shell.

10:03.830 --> 10:05.661
Because Stern keeps
taking our clients.

10:05.700 --> 10:06.792
In one year,
your firm

10:06.840 --> 10:10.332
will be nothing but an empty
floor in an office building.

10:10.370 --> 10:13.305
Stern's got equity,
plenty of business,

10:13.340 --> 10:18.175
and one more thing:
no contest.

10:19.720 --> 10:24.214
That's right, your little
contest with Mrs. Florrick.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.740
You're losing.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.018
I got more billable hours.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.415
And Florrick's got
a name.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.018
Stern is new.

10:31.060 --> 10:33.824
There's a better path
to partnership.

10:33.860 --> 10:36.727
Think about it.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.862
You won't be alone.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.039
Oh, I won't be alone?

10:40.070 --> 10:42.061
In leaving
Lockhart, Gardner.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.328
You're raiding us?

10:43.370 --> 10:44.701
Mm-hmm.

10:46.710 --> 10:49.235
PETER:
So where are we
on getting me to church?

10:49.280 --> 10:50.406
I'm filing a
religious exception

10:50.450 --> 10:51.508
to electronic
monitoring.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.849
It doesn't always work,
but we'll hope for the best.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.211
Maybe next Sunday.

10:56.250 --> 10:57.740
ELI:
And I am getting a photographer
at the church.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.849
I don't care
what the good pastor has to say.

10:59.890 --> 11:01.915
Eli, we're not doing that.

11:04.090 --> 11:05.125
What is it?

11:05.160 --> 11:06.457
What's the mater?
Well, it's...

11:06.490 --> 11:08.048
probably nothing.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.399
Um, Childs is changing the
direction with the retrial.

11:11.430 --> 11:13.432
He's giving up
the sex angle.
What?

11:13.470 --> 11:14.789
That's all he's got.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.899
Is he changing
the trial date?
No.

11:16.940 --> 11:19.261
Two months away.
I don't understand, then.

11:19.310 --> 11:22.700
I am hearing chatter
about a surprise witness.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.048
E|i (sighs):
So who can hurt you?

11:25.080 --> 11:26.911
PETER:
Well, if they're
going to lie,

11:26.950 --> 11:28.838
anybody can hurt me.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.145
Maybe Childs is trying
to quietly make
this disappear.

11:32.190 --> 11:33.179
I doubt it.

11:33.220 --> 11:35.211
Hey, hon.

11:36.390 --> 11:39.086
Gerald Kozko was
at my office today.

11:41.330 --> 11:44.299
He wanted me to tell you
something.

11:44.330 --> 11:46.890
He said, "Tell Peter I'm sorry."

11:47.940 --> 11:49.999
Damn.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.133
No. Kozko and Childs
hate each other.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.138
There's no way he's going
to grant him immunity.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.432
Well, he would if it's
the only way to get Peter.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.799
We need...

12:00.180 --> 12:03.479
You're standing in my kitchen.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.784
Whatever you have to say,
you can say it in front of me.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.822
You heard her.

12:26.570 --> 12:28.777
Mrs. Sanborn,

12:28.810 --> 12:32.814
did your husband have a close
relationship with his employer?

12:32.850 --> 12:34.818
KAREN: Mr. Clay?

12:34.850 --> 12:36.818
Yes. Until recently.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.546
It had become strained--
their friendship.

12:39.590 --> 12:40.909
And why was that?

12:40.960 --> 12:42.450
Objection.
Beyond the scope.

12:42.490 --> 12:45.880
Well, I really think
we're safe here.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.898
Don't you?

12:47.930 --> 12:49.158
You may answer, Mrs. Sanborn.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.919
The paper was
in financial trouble.

12:51.970 --> 12:53.961
They had to lay off
a lot of staff.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.888
The stress took its toll.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.534
Jeff was also frustrated
by Mr. Clay's pursuit

12:58.570 --> 13:00.208
of a New Yorker cover.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.174
Something controversial.

13:02.210 --> 13:05.179
Like the Obama fist-bump cartoon
on the New Yorker.

13:05.210 --> 13:07.212
Something that would
increase readership.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.980
STERN: Well, Mrs. Sanborn,
did your husband help

13:10.020 --> 13:13.217
Mr. Clay choose the cartoon
for publication in the paper?

13:13.260 --> 13:14.284
KAREN: Yes.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.880
It was a contest, and he helped
Mr. Clay judge it.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.989
But the cartoon that appeared
was different,

13:19.030 --> 13:20.019
wasn't it?
Yes.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.197
I saw the original.

13:21.230 --> 13:23.198
It didn't depict Muhammad.

13:23.230 --> 13:25.061
It was just
a Middle-Eastern man.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.931
Jeffrey told me

13:26.970 --> 13:30.565
that the decision to change it
to Muhammad was Mr. Clay's.

13:31.910 --> 13:34.538
To generate more controversy.

13:34.580 --> 13:35.933
Is it just me,

13:35.980 --> 13:39.199
or do we really need
to find that cartoonist?

13:39.250 --> 13:41.047
So, here's your cartoon.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.843
Now, you see this
cross-hatching?

13:42.890 --> 13:44.084
How it almost
looks like bars?

13:44.120 --> 13:46.486
That can indicate a
sense of suffocation.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.919
Like they can't say
what they mean.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.154
In this case,
it might indicate

13:49.190 --> 13:52.159
someone who's a
Muslim themselves.

13:52.190 --> 13:54.158
Fascinating.
Yeah.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.497
Does this really work?

13:55.530 --> 13:57.168
Graphology?

13:57.200 --> 13:58.497
Applied to drawing.

13:58.530 --> 14:01.567
It does if you know
what you're looking for.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.137
You don't respect
my job, do you?

14:04.170 --> 14:06.138
I am... incredulous.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.637
It's best with comparison.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.875
You run an image search,
cross-referenced

14:09.910 --> 14:12.140
with the unique elements
of the sample drawing.

14:12.180 --> 14:14.978
Still too much.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.988
Narrow it by location.

14:17.020 --> 14:18.044
Chicago.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.149
Better.

14:22.260 --> 14:24.057
Mm.

14:25.090 --> 14:27.923
(chuckles)

14:27.960 --> 14:29.393
Wow.

14:29.430 --> 14:30.988
Looks like I am a believer.

14:31.030 --> 14:33.999
The thing is,
when you hired me,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.996
I was told the
firm had a program

14:36.040 --> 14:38.008
for lending associates money
against our salaries--

14:38.040 --> 14:40.008
for down payments, cars.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.268
Accounting
turned you down?
Yeah.

14:41.310 --> 14:43.369
And I got my eye on a
condo in Lincoln Park.

14:43.410 --> 14:44.900
Interest rates
are still low.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.919
Look, money's a little tight
these days, that's all.

14:47.950 --> 14:48.871
Yeah, I just
want to know

14:48.920 --> 14:50.285
if there's anything
I should be aware of.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.208
About my future.
About your...?

14:52.250 --> 14:53.387
No.

14:53.420 --> 14:55.251
Nobody's trying
to tell you anything.

14:55.290 --> 14:56.518
It's just money's tight.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.380
_ So I'm still
in the running?

14:58.430 --> 14:59.658
You are.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.328
Nobody's made any decisions yet.

15:03.300 --> 15:04.324
Is that it?

15:05.370 --> 15:06.997
Yes.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.631
KOZKO:
So how's Peter doing?

15:15.680 --> 15:17.705
GOLDEN:
He's good. I mean,
he'd be a lot better

15:17.750 --> 15:20.719
if he had a clearer sense
of what Childs was planning.

15:20.750 --> 15:23.048
So, he got the message?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.387
My apology?
Yeah.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.684
Look, you and Peter
go back a long way.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.187
If Childs is threatening you,

15:28.220 --> 15:30.688
Peter wants to help his friends
in any way he can.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.425
Well, I don't want
to hurt Peter.

15:32.460 --> 15:33.688
But it's not just me.

15:33.730 --> 15:36.028
I have a legacy to protect.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.960
My son.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.093
GOLDEN:
Peter has a family, too.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.266
KOZKO:
We all have families.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.528
Okay, let's cut
the pleasantries.

15:42.570 --> 15:46.062
Whatever you have, or think
you can devise, to hurt Peter--

15:46.110 --> 15:47.702
he has twice as much
to hurt you.

15:47.740 --> 15:51.176
I know your reputation,
Mr. Gold.

15:51.210 --> 15:52.746
Then you know
I don't screw around.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.145
I know Peter has religion.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.011
Meaning?

15:58.050 --> 15:59.688
He's off his game.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.527
You have a pastor giving him
spiritual instruction.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.551
Now he's going to church.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.761
Hey, I'm in risk
assessment, Mr. Gold.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.132
At the moment, Childs
is the bigger risk.

16:13.170 --> 16:15.092
Did he give you immunity?

16:19.640 --> 16:21.608
Oh, that's not good.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.074
Not at all.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.648
KALIN DA:
We don't threaten

16:31.690 --> 16:33.783
with a subpoena unless
he refuses to testify.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.789
How about we don't
threaten at all?

16:36.820 --> 16:39.050
Yes?

16:39.090 --> 16:40.057
Mrs. Bassir?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.055
Dr. Bassir.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.055
May I help you?

16:42.100 --> 16:43.124
Oh, so sorry.
Yes, of course.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.523
Um, is your husband home?

16:44.570 --> 16:46.595
My husband?

16:46.630 --> 16:48.029
My husband doesn't live
in this country.

16:48.070 --> 16:50.129
Is there a Tarik
Bassir here?

16:50.170 --> 16:51.137
A cartoonist?

16:51.170 --> 16:53.138
Yeah, that's me.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.636
What's up?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.079
TARIK:
Yeah, it was my idea.

16:56.110 --> 16:58.146
Some jerk at the airport
gave me a hard time,

16:58.180 --> 16:59.169
so I drew about it.

16:59.210 --> 17:01.075
First I made it just a picture
of a random Muslim.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.088
Then I thought--
what the hell?

17:03.120 --> 17:04.485
Language.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.488
I mean, if I'm going
to make a statement,

17:06.520 --> 17:08.579
why not really make
a statement, you know?

17:08.620 --> 17:11.384
So it was your
idea to depict...
The Prophet.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.126
Yeah. Somebody has to do
something or the Fundies win.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.127
The...

17:15.160 --> 17:17.060
Fundamentalists.
I e-mailed Clay,

17:17.100 --> 17:18.522
told him I wanted
to change the cartoon.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.538
Put it out in the open,
get other Muslims

17:20.570 --> 17:22.367
_to reexamine
their preconceptions.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.833
Then why do it
anonymously?

17:23.870 --> 17:25.838
Hey, I'm 15 years old.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.132
Why do I do anything?

17:27.180 --> 17:28.477
You have to understand--

17:28.510 --> 17:30.671
I knew nothing
about any of this.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.075
Not until after.

17:32.110 --> 17:33.213
And would you be willing

17:33.250 --> 17:34.649
to testify about
all of this, Tarik?

17:34.680 --> 17:35.840
That's not up to Tarik.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.519
Well, he could testify
in camera--

17:38.550 --> 17:39.539
in the judge's chambers.

17:39.590 --> 17:40.716
There would only
be the judge,

17:40.760 --> 17:42.284
the lavwers, the
court reporters.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.288
We would use
a pseudonym.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.753
Mrs. Florrick, Miss Sharma,

17:46.790 --> 17:49.759
I know the name_
of only one cartoonist.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.768
Kurt Westergaard,

17:51.800 --> 17:53.791
the man who drew one

17:53.840 --> 17:54.829
of the cartoons
of Muhammad

17:54.870 --> 17:56.462
in the Danish paper
five years ago.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.865
And he has been living

17:57.910 --> 18:00.401
under 24-hour security
since then.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.477
I will not do that to my son.

18:04.850 --> 18:07.239
DIANE: You explained
he could testify in camera?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.248
ALICIA: Yes. She doesn't
want to take a chance.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.111
DIANE: Well, if she
doesn't produce him,

18:11.150 --> 18:12.185
she'll be held
in contempt.

18:12.220 --> 18:13.209
No.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.387
Uh, we need him.

18:15.420 --> 18:17.251
He is the only one
who can corroborate

18:17.290 --> 18:20.748
the cartoon was
his idea, not yours.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.894
I already have Jeff Sanborn's
blood on my hands.

18:23.930 --> 18:26.125
I won't have this kid's.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.263
DIANE:
This kid is all we have,
Charles.

18:33.210 --> 18:36.338
If we don't use him, we need
an alternate story for the jury.

18:36.380 --> 18:38.348
Coun_terte_rrorism
unit just finished

18:38.380 --> 18:40.211
its preliminary
bombing report.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.218
Maybe there's something
we overlooked.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.218
Can you get your hands on it?

18:44.250 --> 18:46.241
I can try.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.487
CARY:
IfI leave Lockhart/Gardner,

18:50.530 --> 18:53.158
I don't want it to be a dozen
junior assoqates and me.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.553
It won't be.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.556
We've got an equity partner.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.591
Ten associates.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.633
You got an equity partner?

19:01.670 --> 19:05.436
There's a lot of unhappiness
at Lockhart/Gardner.

19:05.470 --> 19:07.472
Which one?
(giggling)

19:09.240 --> 19:10.673
I like your hair messy.

19:10.710 --> 19:11.870
Don't comb it, okay?

19:11.910 --> 19:15.346
Ten litigators,
an unhappy equity partner.

19:15.380 --> 19:18.349
It's Julius, isn't it?

19:18.390 --> 19:21.848
He was always close
to Stern.

19:21.890 --> 19:25.155
You are a smart boy.

19:35.770 --> 19:38.238
He tried to poach you?

19:38.270 --> 19:38.929
Stern did?

19:38.970 --> 19:40.631
Yes.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.205
And 11 others.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.241
VVho?

19:45.280 --> 19:47.419
The only name I know
is Julius Cain.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.647
I don't want you to think
for one moment

19:51.690 --> 19:53.214
I was considering taking it.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.319
Of course not.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.281
I'm a team player.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.221
I just want to do what's
right for the firm.

20:01.330 --> 20:02.991
Thanks, Cary.

20:03.030 --> 20:04.588
Yeah.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.335
Oh.

20:09.370 --> 20:11.668
I'm working on your loan.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.735
I think we can make it work.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.736
Thanks.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.702
I really appreciate that.

20:17.750 --> 20:18.842
Yes, I was at the Vindicator

20:18.880 --> 20:21.371
when Mr. Clay made the decision
to publish the cartoon.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.786
And did you argue against it?
I did.

20:23.820 --> 20:26.744
I felt it was insensitive
to Muslim believers,

20:26.790 --> 20:28.758
especially when the same point
could be made

20:28.790 --> 20:29.859
without depicting Muhammad.

20:29.890 --> 20:32.984
You also argued
that it was reckless.

20:33.030 --> 20:35.726
I was the reporter
on the synagogue bombing.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.524
I saw the devastation
that caused.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.561
Mr. Thiessen,
were you present

20:40.600 --> 20:41.794
when Mr. Clay met

20:41.840 --> 20:43.705
with the Vindicator lawyer
prior to the publication

20:43.740 --> 20:45.401
of the cartoon?

20:45.440 --> 20:46.907
Objection, Your Honor!
Attorney-client privilege.

20:46.940 --> 20:50.307
Mr. Thiess_en observed
the conversation, Your Honor,

20:50.350 --> 20:53.319
and is not covered
by the privilege.

20:53.350 --> 20:55.773
That makes sense to me.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.048
Doesn't it, Ms. Lockhart?

20:57.080 --> 20:57.887
I'll allow.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.787
STERN:
What was said
at this meeting?

21:00.820 --> 21:02.754
The lawyer referenced
the New York Times

21:02.790 --> 21:03.984
and Yale University Press

21:04.030 --> 21:05.679
decision not to reprint
the Danish cartoon.

21:05.730 --> 21:07.994
He believed, in both cases,

21:08.030 --> 21:09.998
the fear of inciting violence

21:10.030 --> 21:11.520
trumped the public's
need to know.

21:11.570 --> 21:12.821
Thank you, sir.

21:16.740 --> 21:18.537
Mr. Thiessen, you were worried

21:18.570 --> 21:20.709
that the paper would
be insensitive

21:20.740 --> 21:23.038
to religious believers
by printing the cartoon?

21:23.080 --> 21:24.047
Yes.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.708
I'm not a Muslim myself,
but I can sympathize.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.741
And what is this?

21:32.720 --> 21:34.813
"Piss Christ."

21:36.020 --> 21:37.556
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

21:37.590 --> 21:39.558
"Piss... Christ."

21:39.590 --> 21:42.457
Yes, an artwork
depicting a crucifix

21:42.500 --> 21:45.697
placed in a cup of urine.

21:45.730 --> 21:48.528
This photo illustrated
an article of yours

21:48.570 --> 21:50.367
on controversial art?

21:50.410 --> 21:51.468
My goodness.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.434
Why not the same sensitivity
to religious believers?

21:54.480 --> 21:58.075
_ _ Because _that_
is unlikely to mate Violence.

21:58.110 --> 22:01.614
So, it's not about sensitivity,
it's about fear?

22:01.650 --> 22:02.742
It's about both.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.919
Mm-hmm. You were fired

22:04.950 --> 22:06.781
from the Vindicator,
weren't you, Mr. Thiessen,

22:06.820 --> 22:08.879
as part of Mr. Clay's
cost-cutting?

22:08.920 --> 22:12.481
Yes. But that has nothing
to do with my testimony.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.751
(key rattling)

22:19.470 --> 22:20.767
Who are you?

22:20.800 --> 22:23.462
The plumber. Who are you?

22:23.510 --> 22:25.762
I'm Jackie.

22:26.810 --> 22:28.630
That means nothing to me.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.102
Peter's mother.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.370
(gasps)
Oh, yes, of course.

22:32.410 --> 22:34.139
Mrs. Florrick.
I'm... I'm Eli Gold.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.546
Please, come on in.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.481
You're not the plumber.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.395
No.

22:47.430 --> 22:50.467
I'm Peter's, uh,
image consultant.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.388
Call me Eli.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.668
I like that brooch.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.702
(sighs)
Thank you. Where's my son?

22:58.740 --> 23:00.571
He's just...

23:02.640 --> 23:05.700
He's meeting with his pastor.

23:06.750 --> 23:07.876
His...

23:07.920 --> 23:09.911
Pastor.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.511
But please go in.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.414
I'm sure they'd
love to say hello.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.866
PASTOR: Yeah,
it was good.

23:29.900 --> 23:32.869
We had a guide
and a porter.

23:32.910 --> 23:36.073
And his sister
was there.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.977
They've been meeting
once a week for prayer,

23:41.020 --> 23:43.488
spiritual guidance...

23:43.520 --> 23:46.216
and the sharing
of Jesus Christ.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.150
Who is that man?

23:48.190 --> 23:49.782
Isaiah Easton,

23:49.820 --> 23:52.550
pastor at Lord
in Christ Church.

23:52.590 --> 23:54.091
On 95th?

23:54.130 --> 23:56.098
Yes.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.791
Southside.

24:01.170 --> 24:03.809
KALINDA:
There is something
in the FBI report.

24:03.840 --> 24:08.072
The theory is that
the bomb was tossed in
through the window.

24:08.110 --> 24:10.499
Just like
the synagogue.
Yeah.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.575
But all the windows
were blown out by the force

24:12.610 --> 24:13.918
of the blast.

24:13.950 --> 24:15.747
So?
So there's
no way to tell

24:15.780 --> 24:17.839
if the bomb was
tossed in or not.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.687
That's the blast site.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.553
You remember what Clay said?

24:22.590 --> 24:26.151
Those dumbwaiters they
used during Prohibition
to haul the liquor up--

24:26.190 --> 24:27.498
they're all over the place.

24:27.530 --> 24:29.691
KALIN DA:
So, this is the access

24:29.730 --> 24:30.992
to the office dumbwaiter.

24:31.030 --> 24:32.793
Well, the blast
blew it apart.

24:32.830 --> 24:35.833
It doesn't mean it
went up this way.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.708
What?

24:43.750 --> 24:45.741
ALICIA:
What is it?

24:46.810 --> 24:49.472
Kalinda, words.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.288
The bomb was hydrogen nitrate,

24:53.320 --> 24:54.685
a liquid explosive,

24:54.720 --> 24:57.518
and it stains
concrete, not tile.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.028
How do you know that?
Looked it up.

25:01.260 --> 25:02.796
Look.

25:02.830 --> 25:05.867
The stain splattered here...

25:05.900 --> 25:07.629
not here.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.035
Concrete, not tile.

25:09.070 --> 25:11.265
Well, it could have
come down the shaft

25:11.310 --> 25:12.538
from the blast.

25:12.570 --> 25:13.832
Not in liquid form.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.836
So, what are you saying,

25:15.880 --> 25:17.199
someone mixed
the bomb here

25:17.240 --> 25:19.299
and raised it...
on the dumbwaiter?

25:19.350 --> 25:21.614
I'm not saying anything;
I'm just staring

25:21.650 --> 25:23.072
at a stain.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.680
But if the bomb
was mixed here...

25:25.720 --> 25:27.711
we're talking
about an inside job.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.690
The blast blew apart the
wall with the dumbwaiter,

25:39.730 --> 25:41.789
so there was no evidence
that it was even there.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.296
Should I bring
Julius in on this?

25:43.340 --> 25:44.967
No, not yet.
We'll update him later.

25:45.010 --> 25:48.571
I still don't understand
how the Feds missed this.

25:48.610 --> 25:50.305
Well, my guess
is, they didn't.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.807
Their investigation
is still open.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.169
They just didn't issue
any of their findings.

25:53.210 --> 25:54.609
And they won't
until they catch

25:54.650 --> 25:55.742
whoever's responsible.

25:55.780 --> 25:57.247
Cary.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.315
Come on in.

25:58.350 --> 26:00.614
The question is,
what does it mean?

26:00.660 --> 26:03.959
Well, Stern's theory
is that Clay wanted
a violent backlash.

26:03.990 --> 26:06.959
That rests on the fact that
he cut back security.

26:06.990 --> 26:08.594
Yeah, but if the bomb
came from inside,

26:08.630 --> 26:10.666
no security would've been
able to prevent it.
Right.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.588
Stern will still argue
that the bomb was planted

26:12.630 --> 26:13.790
by a radical
Islamic group.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.694
They just had help
from inside.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.934
So talk to the employees.

26:16.970 --> 26:18.267
That could help.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.266
A lone bomber in the office.

26:20.310 --> 26:22.278
How many
Muslim employees
does he have?

26:22.310 --> 26:23.948
WILL:
Can't be many.

26:23.980 --> 26:25.948
So we're going to
racially profile?

26:25.980 --> 26:28.141
The exact thing
the cartoon was against.

26:28.180 --> 26:29.943
No. We're gonna
step nicely

26:29.980 --> 26:33.313
past the ironies
and defend our client.

26:33.350 --> 26:35.955
DIANE:
Go over the employees
for the last five years.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.116
Okay.

26:40.660 --> 26:42.127
Shall we?

26:46.730 --> 26:49.369
WILL:
Julius, can we talk
to you for a second?

26:49.400 --> 26:50.833
What's that about?

26:54.810 --> 26:56.869
It's a betrayal.

26:56.910 --> 26:58.673
It's a business
deCI5ion.

26:58.710 --> 26:59.608
What happened to loyalty?

26:59.650 --> 27:02.710
It exited the building
the day you fired

27:02.750 --> 27:05.389
half of tax
Hﬁgaﬁon.

27:05.420 --> 27:07.047
(sighs)
Look”.

27:07.090 --> 27:10.059
I really didn't want it
to get back to you this way,

27:10.090 --> 27:11.978
but, uh, it's no secret
this place is

27:12.030 --> 27:13.088
going through
financial troubles.

27:13.130 --> 27:15.655
Half of which is
Stern's fault, Julius.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.725
There was trouble
before Stern

27:17.770 --> 27:19.362
started to take clients.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.096
Right now his firm
seems more stable,

27:22.140 --> 27:24.768
and I consider him a mentor.
DIANE:
So do I.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.438
But at the end of the day,
I bet on myself, not him.

27:27.470 --> 27:28.778
With Stern,
it's all about Stern.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.778
I'm sorry.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.287
Julius.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.153
You're one of the best
lawyers we have.

27:41.190 --> 27:42.817
You have a great client list.

27:44.190 --> 27:46.158
So what's it gonna take?

27:49.800 --> 27:52.667
Here's my offer
from Stern.

27:59.340 --> 28:01.171
We can match it.

28:05.810 --> 28:08.176
What about,
uh, gearing up

28:08.220 --> 28:10.176
that diversity program
we keep talking about?

28:10.220 --> 28:12.780
That'll cost us money
we don't have.

28:12.820 --> 28:15.186
We lag behind virtually
every other major Chicago firm

28:15.220 --> 28:16.756
in diversity hiring.

28:16.790 --> 28:18.724
I'm tired of being
the poster boy

28:18.760 --> 28:19.988
for affirmative
action around here.

28:20.030 --> 28:21.827
Okay, fine.

28:21.860 --> 28:23.919
We'll find the money.

28:25.530 --> 28:26.895
All right.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.838
Now, it's your turn

28:34.880 --> 28:36.836
to do something for us.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.348
Ten other lavwers
who were gonna go with you--...

28:40.380 --> 28:42.041
...their names.

28:43.820 --> 28:46.812
What, you want me to...

28:46.850 --> 28:48.818
But now they'll stay.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.487
Stern wanted me, not them.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.885
We don't want turncoats

28:51.930 --> 28:53.955
with access _
to proprietary information.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.457
You're gonna fire them.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.866
It's more money
for diversity hiring.

29:02.570 --> 29:04.401
Write down the names.

29:11.180 --> 29:13.307
What is that?
The results

29:13.350 --> 29:14.544
of my questioning
the employees.

29:14.580 --> 29:15.774
One received that

29:15.820 --> 29:17.173
the week before
the attack.

29:17.220 --> 29:18.983
Tell they didn't
take this to Clay.

29:19.020 --> 29:21.284
They took
it to Clay.
And he ignored it?

29:21.320 --> 29:23.185
Yes.
Which makes it
even worse

29:23.220 --> 29:24.482
that _it was
an InSIde job.

29:24.530 --> 29:28.990
Clay isn't liable for
unforeseeable acts
of his employees.

29:29.030 --> 29:31.191
But now? If he
had prior notice?

29:31.230 --> 29:33.369
If we know this,
Stern knows this.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.095
Oh, well, that's
a happy thought.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.835
That's me, Mr. Cheer.

29:36.870 --> 29:38.201
Well, it makes Clay's
questioning tomorrow

29:38.240 --> 29:39.901
that much more
important.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.976
Oh. Which brings up
another problem.

29:42.010 --> 29:43.307
Julius was

29:43.340 --> 29:44.477
handHng
questioning.

29:44.510 --> 29:46.398
Why is that a problem?

29:46.450 --> 29:48.270
Maybe Cary
should take it.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.811
No. Alicia.

29:50.850 --> 29:53.489
She can get in
Stern's face more
effectively.

29:53.520 --> 29:54.885
(elevator bell dings)

29:57.060 --> 30:00.257
The fact is, you know something
about Stern no one else knows.

30:00.290 --> 30:01.928
I can't use it, Kalinda.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.291
You can't not use it.

30:03.330 --> 30:05.469
It violates
attorney-client
privilege.

30:05.500 --> 30:09.539
Only if you tell someone,
so don't tell someone.

30:09.570 --> 30:10.867
(indistinct chatter)

30:10.910 --> 30:12.104
All right,
see you, then.

30:12.140 --> 30:13.903
(door closes)

30:14.940 --> 30:18.103
I want you to meet
Bishop Grayson.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.879
Mom.

30:19.910 --> 30:21.377
He's a nice Episcopalian priest.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.947
He will help you put this
religion stuff into perspective.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.345
It is in perspective.
That's not perspective.

30:28.490 --> 30:30.617
This is about Alicia, isn't it?

30:30.660 --> 30:31.957
No.

30:31.990 --> 30:33.958
No, it's not.
It's about me.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.558
And I need a change.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.625
No, you don't, Peter.

30:37.660 --> 30:39.423
You are a good man.

30:39.470 --> 30:41.597
You want to blame yourself.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.528
But you apologized.

30:43.570 --> 30:45.959
You apologized again, and again.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.934
Anybody who wants another
apology from you

30:48.980 --> 30:50.971
only wants you
to be weak.

30:51.010 --> 30:51.977
So stop this.

30:52.010 --> 30:54.513
Stop this now.

30:54.550 --> 30:57.269
My son will not be made weak.

31:01.220 --> 31:03.279
(chuckles)

31:04.330 --> 31:06.286
You are one scary mom.

31:07.490 --> 31:10.926
Yes. And you are
a good son.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.896
ALICIA:
Mrs. Sanborn stated

31:15.940 --> 31:17.999
_ under oath that
it was your deCI5ion

31:18.040 --> 31:20.531
to have the cartoon depict
the Prophet Muhammad.

31:20.570 --> 31:22.401
That's untrue.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.271
The cartoonist
contacted me

31:24.310 --> 31:25.971
with that idea.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.079
Still,

31:27.110 --> 31:29.544
it was your decision
to run the cartoon, Mr. Clay.

31:29.580 --> 31:30.569
Why did you?

31:30.620 --> 31:32.645
'Cause it was newsworthy.

31:32.690 --> 31:34.419
It wasn't sensational.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.155
And this is America--

31:36.190 --> 31:37.919
we can handle it.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.985
Thank you.

31:40.030 --> 31:41.395
JONAS:
Mr. Clay,

31:41.430 --> 31:44.661
what is The
Naked Columnist?

31:44.700 --> 31:46.565
(exhales)

31:46.600 --> 31:49.034
An advice columnist
in my paper

31:49.070 --> 31:52.665
who supposedly answers
questions in the nude.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.200
And that is newsworthy.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.639
That's not sensational.

31:55.680 --> 31:56.977
It is not on the front page.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.170
And this is America.

31:58.210 --> 31:59.370
We can handle it.

31:59.410 --> 32:02.015
The Naked... Columnist.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.018
CLAY:
There's room for
entertainment

32:04.050 --> 32:05.017
in every paper.

32:05.050 --> 32:06.688
A lot of room,
apparently.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.587
You devoted 10,000
column inches

32:09.620 --> 32:11.724
to The Naked
Columnist last year.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.024
Do you know how many
you devoted to Iraq?

32:14.060 --> 32:17.029
I'm battling Internet
competitors, sir.

32:17.060 --> 32:20.120
Competitors who are
willing to give away
their product for free.

32:20.170 --> 32:25.039
Mr. Clay, are you aware
that the police now believe

32:25.070 --> 32:26.298
that this bombing was

32:26.340 --> 32:27.466
an inside job?

32:27.510 --> 32:29.705
Objection!
Not in evidence.
Yes.

32:29.740 --> 32:33.506
Your Honor, this is
plaintiff's exhibit N--

32:33.550 --> 32:36.041
the police report...

32:36.080 --> 32:37.342
filed...

32:37.380 --> 32:39.689
yesterday morning.

32:43.090 --> 32:44.648
JONAS:
Mr. Clay, you don't know

32:44.690 --> 32:46.089
anything about this, do you?

32:46.130 --> 32:47.085
Objection!
Argumentative.

32:47.130 --> 32:49.621
Uh, Your Honor, it's a
simple leading question.

32:49.660 --> 32:51.025
Overruled.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.389
Um, you may answer.

32:52.430 --> 32:55.069
I'm sorry,
wh-what was the question?

32:55.100 --> 32:57.694
The question was, uh...

32:57.740 --> 32:59.708
The police

32:59.740 --> 33:03.733
now believe that the bombing
was an inside job, that the bomb

33:03.780 --> 33:07.045
was hoisted up
through a dumbwaiter.
Objection! Again,

33:07.080 --> 33:09.014
not in evidence.
It is in

33:09.050 --> 33:10.210
the investigative report.

33:10.250 --> 33:12.047
The investigative report
merely states

33:12.090 --> 33:14.684
that it appears
a bomb was planted from inside.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.119
It doesn't say
anything specifically

33:16.160 --> 33:17.115
about dumbwaiters.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.388
We ask that statement

33:18.430 --> 33:19.556
be stricken
from the record.

33:19.590 --> 33:21.057
Is that really necessary,

33:21.100 --> 33:22.089
Mrs. Florrick?

33:22.130 --> 33:23.119
Overruled.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.567
STERN:
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.091
Uh...

33:28.140 --> 33:29.630
Ugh. (laughs)

33:29.670 --> 33:31.638
Where was I?

33:31.670 --> 33:33.399
Uh, right, right.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.577
Dumbwaiter,
employees.

33:34.610 --> 33:36.134
So, Mr. Clay,

33:36.180 --> 33:37.374
have any of the employees

33:37.410 --> 33:40.049
approached you about threats
they might have been receiv...?

33:40.080 --> 33:41.069
Objection.
Overly vague.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.075
Mrs. Florrick.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.246
You're right.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.440
Withdrawn, Your Honor.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.050
You may proceed, Mr. Stern.

33:47.090 --> 33:49.752
Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.

33:51.190 --> 33:54.421
Um... One moment.

33:56.600 --> 33:57.658
Mr. Stern?

33:57.700 --> 33:58.792
Yes. Just-just

33:58.830 --> 34:00.127
one moment, please. Thank you.

34:00.170 --> 34:01.239
(whispering):
Inside job.

34:01.270 --> 34:03.067
The threat.
A threat.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.169
JUDGE:
Mr. Stern.
The documents.
No, no.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.303
Do you have any further
questions for this witness?

34:06.340 --> 34:07.568
Damn it, give me a minute!

34:12.280 --> 34:14.714
Oh.

34:14.750 --> 34:16.718
I am sorry, Your Honor.

34:16.750 --> 34:19.218
I... Ijust, uh...

34:20.290 --> 34:23.157
I, um...

34:27.390 --> 34:29.426
I have nothing further.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.191
(Clay clears throat)

34:34.240 --> 34:36.492
JUDGE:
Thank you, Mr. Clay.

34:36.540 --> 34:38.235
You are dismissed.

34:38.270 --> 34:40.306
Please refrain from
speaking with the jury

34:40.340 --> 34:43.503
and make yourself available
for further questions.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.303
At this time,

34:45.350 --> 34:48.148
I suggest a, uh,
a ten-minute recess.

34:53.890 --> 34:55.152
CARY:
You know
what I don't understand?

34:55.190 --> 34:56.384
We're still
treating this

34:56.420 --> 34:58.627
like jihad even though
it's an inside job.

34:58.660 --> 35:00.457
Because of the
threat. The bomb?

35:00.490 --> 35:02.151
Look.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.394
(sighs)

35:03.430 --> 35:05.898
You were talking about
racial profiling, right?

35:05.930 --> 35:07.761
What if someone
was usmg our bias

35:07.800 --> 35:09.768
to make us think
it was jihad

35:09.800 --> 35:12.462
when it was really
something else?

35:12.510 --> 35:13.829
Okay.

35:13.870 --> 35:15.531
I'm listening.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.105
And...

35:20.350 --> 35:21.772
That's all I got.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.789
I didn't say I was
solving something.

35:24.820 --> 35:26.481
I just said I
didn't understand.

35:29.790 --> 35:31.587
I want credit for it.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.689
Whatever you get,
I want credit.

35:33.730 --> 35:36.324
Hmm. Whatever.

35:36.360 --> 35:39.227
CARY:
Mr. Thiessen,
you covered the bombing

35:39.270 --> 35:40.419
at the Oak Lawn synagogue?

35:40.470 --> 35:41.789
That's right.
And it's

35:41.840 --> 35:42.898
your opinion
that this bomb

35:42.940 --> 35:44.635
was very similar
to that one?

35:44.670 --> 35:45.807
THIESSEN:
Identical.

35:45.840 --> 35:46.761
In both cases,

35:46.810 --> 35:48.437
the device was fashioned
from a metal canister,

35:48.480 --> 35:50.436
densely packed
with hydrazine

35:50.480 --> 35:52.300
nitrate explosive and a

35:52.350 --> 35:53.647
simple,
remote-triggered circuit.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.671
But this utilized a different
triggering mechanism

35:55.720 --> 35:57.176
than the synagogue bombing?

35:57.220 --> 35:58.482
No, no.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.181
It was identical.

36:00.220 --> 36:02.279
CARY:
A modified flashbulb?

36:02.320 --> 36:03.514
Yes, from a camera.

36:03.560 --> 36:04.629
It's quite clever.

36:04.660 --> 36:06.582
It produces just enough flame
to trigger the fuse.

36:06.630 --> 36:08.655
CARY:
Oh, that's
interesting.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.588
But when you reported
on the synagogue bombing,

36:10.630 --> 36:11.892
you never mentioned that fact.

36:11.930 --> 36:13.864
THIESSEN:
It's kind of a
technical detail.

36:13.900 --> 36:16.562
A little beyond the scope
of a basic news article.

36:16.600 --> 36:17.760
CARY:
Of course.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.358
It's just that

36:19.410 --> 36:20.968
whoever planted the
bomb at the Vindicator

36:21.010 --> 36:22.978
had to know the layout
of the building,

36:23.010 --> 36:25.899
the dumbwaiters,
Mr. Sanborn's schedule,

36:25.950 --> 36:27.406
and how to build a bomb

36:27.450 --> 36:29.668
exactly like
the Defenders of Allah's.

36:29.720 --> 36:30.846

Objection, Your Honor!

36:30.880 --> 36:32.211
JUDGE:
Objection?

36:32.250 --> 36:33.547
There hasn't been
a question yet.

36:33.590 --> 36:35.615
Overruled.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.981
And if you never reported
on the triggering mechanism,

36:38.020 --> 36:40.727
Mr. Thiessen,
the only person I can think of

36:40.760 --> 36:43.297
who possesses all

36:43.330 --> 36:44.888
RACHEL:
Objection, Your Honor.

36:44.930 --> 36:46.818
This is completely
without basis.

36:46.870 --> 36:48.690
JUDGE:
Yes, I'm afraid
you're right.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.696
I have to sustain
that objection.

37:15.830 --> 37:16.956
thank you

37:17.000 --> 37:18.627
Peter.
Pastor.

37:18.670 --> 37:19.819
Pastor,

37:19.870 --> 37:20.928
this is Zach

37:20.970 --> 37:22.369
Welcome.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.699
* Do Lord, oh, do Lord,
oh, do remember me... *

37:25.740 --> 37:28.300
Mrs. Florrick, would you
ever like to talk sometime,

37:28.340 --> 37:30.308
just the two of us?

37:30.340 --> 37:31.876
No.

37:31.910 --> 37:36.745
I have respected the way
you've stood by your husband.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.987
_ It's a lesson
in forbearance.

37:39.020 --> 37:42.057
Well, it's a lesson
in something.

37:42.090 --> 37:44.524
* I took Jesus as my savior

37:44.560 --> 37:46.551
* You can take Him, too...

37:48.400 --> 37:50.550
You told your boss.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.965
About being poached? Sure.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.558
And Julius?

37:53.600 --> 37:55.363
I told you that in confidence.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.933
Stern found out I leaked.

37:58.970 --> 38:00.904
He fired me.

38:00.940 --> 38:03.909
I know. That's
why the coffee.

38:03.940 --> 38:04.975
Why'd you tell them?

38:05.010 --> 38:06.773
Why didn't you just

38:06.810 --> 38:09.870
come over to Stern's?

38:09.920 --> 38:11.945
You don't seem like
the loyal type.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.014
I know.

38:13.050 --> 38:14.586
It's crazy, huh?

38:14.620 --> 38:15.780
What about
Lockhart/Gardner?

38:15.820 --> 38:18.482
Is there a job there?

38:18.530 --> 38:20.088
For who?

38:20.130 --> 38:21.449
Me.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.592
No.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.096
What are you doing?

38:31.140 --> 38:34.803
The coffee was too hot

PASTOR ISAIAH:
I'm talking about
the very essence of our faith.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.485
Take care.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.784
What does
Christian forbearance mean?

38:48.820 --> 38:50.515
When the Apostle Paul wrote

38:50.560 --> 38:52.881
in Philippians,
chapter four, verse five,

38:52.930 --> 38:54.557
"Let your forbearing

38:54.600 --> 38:56.818
spirit be evident to all,"
what did he mean by that?

38:56.860 --> 38:58.828
Did he mean that we should
tell our neighbor...

38:58.870 --> 39:00.064
I'll be right back.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.364
...I'll put up with you
until you improve?

39:02.400 --> 39:05.938
No. Christian forbearance
has no time limits...

39:05.970 --> 39:07.961
(Pastor Isaiah speaking
in distance)

39:08.980 --> 39:10.971
Gerry.

39:13.010 --> 39:14.841
Okay, it's just us.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.643
What's up?
Well...

39:16.680 --> 39:18.910
PASTOR ISAIAH:
...bears all things
and believes all things...

39:18.950 --> 39:21.657
He's got me in a
corner. Childs.

39:21.690 --> 39:24.579
He's got stuff on me
even you don't know about,

39:24.630 --> 39:25.824
and he'll use it.

39:25.860 --> 39:29.159
(distant piano playing hymn)
Unless you testify against me?

39:29.200 --> 39:31.828
CHOIR: * I'm gonna lay down...
Peter, I have no choice.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.168
* Down by the riverside

39:34.200 --> 39:36.168
* Down by
the riverside *

39:36.200 --> 39:38.088
* Down by the riverside

39:38.140 --> 39:39.266
* I'm gonna lay down...

39:39.310 --> 39:42.939
You know Childs is going to
make you lie on the stand.

39:42.980 --> 39:44.971
It's not all lies.

39:45.010 --> 39:47.001
Not the videotape of us.

39:47.050 --> 39:49.610
* Study war no more...

39:49.650 --> 39:51.015
You know the meeting
in the hotel room.

39:51.050 --> 39:52.586
* Study war no more

39:52.620 --> 39:57.011
* Study war no mor-or-ore

39:57.060 --> 39:59.028
* I ain't gonna study war
no more *

39:59.060 --> 40:00.925
Do you believe in hell?

40:03.200 --> 40:05.998
Do I believe in hell?

40:06.030 --> 40:07.998
Sure. Why?

40:08.030 --> 40:10.931
Do you believe you have
to answer for your sins?

40:10.970 --> 40:12.528
Peter, we don't have time.

40:12.570 --> 40:13.935
Do you believe it?

40:13.970 --> 40:15.608
* Down by the riverside...

40:15.640 --> 40:16.971
Actually, I do, yes.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.668
* Study war no more...

40:21.720 --> 40:24.041
Peter, I'm sorry.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.889
He threatened me.

40:25.920 --> 40:27.080
Childs threatened me.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.587
He threatened
everything.

40:28.620 --> 40:30.918
Let's not even talk about
the stuff I have on you,

40:30.960 --> 40:33.121
because you're beyond
caring about that.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.890
Let's, let's talk
about the stuff I have
on your son Anthony.

40:35.930 --> 40:38.694
Your married son.

40:38.730 --> 40:40.095
That's right.

40:40.130 --> 40:42.496
Your beautiful legacy.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.735
(smashing)
Peter.

40:44.770 --> 40:47.000
Peter, don't.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.701
Don't. You're a Christian.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.833
You're damn right I am.

40:50.880 --> 40:51.949
* Down by the riverside...

40:51.980 --> 40:55.177
Haven't you read
the Old Testament?

40:55.220 --> 40:57.108
* Down by the riverside

40:57.150 --> 41:00.483
* Study war no more

41:00.520 --> 41:03.182
* I ain't gonna
study war no more *

41:03.220 --> 41:05.723
* I ain't gonna *
* Study war no more

41:05.760 --> 41:10.595
* Study war no mo-or-ore

41:10.630 --> 41:11.858
* Study war no more

41:11.900 --> 41:12.992
* I ain't gonna *

41:13.030 --> 41:14.065
* Study war no more

41:14.100 --> 41:16.034
* No more *

41:19.040 --> 41:21.167
* I ain't gonna
study war no more *

41:21.210 --> 41:22.177
* No more *

41:23.740 --> 41:24.707
* No more *

41:28.750 --> 41:30.047
* Study war no more...

41:30.080 --> 41:32.287
ALICIA:
Tonight's good.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.788
Yeah.

41:34.820 --> 41:35.980
No.

41:36.020 --> 41:37.817
Oh, I can make
the reservation.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.521
No, it's fine.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.925
Will, really,
it's fine.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.029
Hey, I phoned you.

41:43.060 --> 41:45.494
Good. We'll have fun.

41:46.770 --> 41:49.568
Okay, I'll see you soon.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.830
(laughs)
You're going out?

41:51.870 --> 41:53.030
Yup.

41:53.070 --> 41:54.162
Where?

41:54.210 --> 41:55.529
I don't know.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.070
Preheat the oven
for ten minutes.

41:57.110 --> 41:58.600
Ignore the box.

41:58.650 --> 42:01.175
It says it cooks in 12 minutes,
but it's really 15.

42:01.210 --> 42:03.940
Oh, come on. Am I not supposed
to be jealous?

42:03.980 --> 42:06.585
I don't think
I care what you are.

42:06.620 --> 42:08.815
Tell Zach only one
hour on the computer.

42:08.860 --> 42:12.182
I... Ifeel like
you're punishing me

42:12.230 --> 42:14.186
for something I didn't do.

42:14.230 --> 42:15.925
I'm not punishing you, Peter.

42:15.960 --> 42:18.099
I'm going out to dinner
with an old friend.

42:18.130 --> 42:20.894
What you saw at church
was me protecting our family.

42:20.930 --> 42:22.295
The guy was wearing a wire.

42:22.340 --> 42:24.638
It's over.

42:24.670 --> 42:26.137
What is?

42:26.170 --> 42:27.330
Us. Me caring.

42:27.370 --> 42:29.907
Me actually thinking
that you're changing.

42:29.940 --> 42:31.077
I am changing.

42:31.110 --> 42:32.247
No, you're not.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.599
You want to think you are

42:33.650 --> 42:35.618
so you can go back
to what you did before.

42:37.820 --> 42:39.742
Then help me.

42:43.820 --> 42:44.980
Help me.

42:45.030 --> 42:47.021
If you're right, help me.

42:48.060 --> 42:50.949
No.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.922
You once said

42:52.970 --> 42:55.336
that everything would be fine
if we just kept talking.

42:55.370 --> 42:58.237
We can...
We can argue,

42:58.270 --> 43:00.636
we can fight,
but we have to keep talking.

43:00.670 --> 43:03.002
(elevator bell dings)

43:03.040 --> 43:05.179
(elevator doors open)
So, there's nothing I can say?

43:05.210 --> 43:07.178
That's right.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.187
(elevator doors close)

43:27.430 --> 43:31.639
(alarm sounding)
