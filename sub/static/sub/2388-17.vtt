00:02.951 --> 00:04.468
Thanks.

00:04.470 --> 00:06.053
That's weird.
I have a message.

00:06.727 --> 00:08.125
That's weird.

00:08.128 --> 00:09.461
You still have
an answering machine.

00:11.315 --> 00:12.931
Ted, this is the Captain.

00:12.933 --> 00:15.967
Please call me back
at your earliest convenience.

00:17.317 --> 00:19.101
Oh, crap.

00:32.252 --> 00:33.985
Kids, you remember the Captain.

00:33.987 --> 00:36.088
<i>He was one of the richest men</i>
<i>in New York,</i>

00:36.090 --> 00:38.290
<i>and when I met him,</i>
<i>he was married to Zoey,</i>

00:38.292 --> 00:41.176
who I ended up... befriending.

00:41.178 --> 00:44.263
Oh, man, he seems pissed.
Does he?

00:44.265 --> 00:46.215
Yes. Listen.

00:46.217 --> 00:49.017
Ted, this is the Captain.

00:49.019 --> 00:52.721
Please call me back
at your earliest convenience.

00:52.723 --> 00:54.923
Oh, I hear it now.

00:54.925 --> 00:56.024
What? I don't know.

00:56.026 --> 00:58.009
Listen again.

00:58.011 --> 01:01.513
Ted, this is the Captain.

01:03.683 --> 01:07.236
Please call me back
at your earliest convenience.

01:07.238 --> 01:08.904
<i>He sounds pissed.</i>

01:08.906 --> 01:10.873
Yeah, and I think
I know why.

01:10.875 --> 01:13.158
It has to do
with the last time I saw him.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.794
It was, um... it was, like,
a year and a half ago.

01:15.796 --> 01:18.196
Oh, boy, that was a crazy story.

01:18.198 --> 01:19.798
Oh, boy, yeah.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.867
I remember.

01:21.869 --> 01:22.918
You weren't there.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.137
Ted, <i>bubbeleh.</i>

01:25.139 --> 01:28.039
If you have a crazy story,
I was there.

01:28.041 --> 01:29.925
That's just a law
of the universe.

01:29.927 --> 01:31.059
So what happened?

01:31.061 --> 01:32.427
Well, it was a few weeks

01:32.429 --> 01:35.264
after Zoey and I broke up,
and I was on the rebound,

01:35.266 --> 01:39.084
and I kind of rekindled things
with that girl, Becky.

01:39.086 --> 01:41.854
Becky?
Boats, boats, boats.

01:41.856 --> 01:43.121
Boats, boats, boats!

01:43.123 --> 01:45.474
Boats!

01:45.476 --> 01:47.209
What's this
a commercial for again?

01:47.211 --> 01:49.227
I can't quite...

01:49.229 --> 01:52.063
Boats, boats, boats!

01:52.065 --> 01:53.365
Oh, get a room, you two.

01:53.367 --> 01:54.616
<i>You weren't there.</i>

01:54.618 --> 01:56.234
I was, too.

01:56.236 --> 01:58.337
All right, you were there?
Tell me the story.

01:58.339 --> 01:59.788
I like the way you tell it.

01:59.790 --> 02:01.507
Please, I insist.

02:01.509 --> 02:03.342
Okay, we'll tell it together.

02:03.344 --> 02:05.260
Okay.

02:05.262 --> 02:07.930
Lily...
Lily...

02:07.932 --> 02:09.931
had invited us...
...had invited us...

02:09.934 --> 02:10.933
...to an art...

02:10.935 --> 02:12.885
...Garfunkel concert.

02:12.887 --> 02:14.186
...gallery opening.

02:14.188 --> 02:16.271
An Art Garfunkel
gallery opening concert.

02:16.273 --> 02:18.390
Go on, Ted.
You're doing great.

02:18.392 --> 02:19.391
Anyway,

02:19.393 --> 02:20.776
I get to the gallery...

02:20.778 --> 02:23.278
This place is so fancy.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.447
I hope I don't embarrass myself.

02:25.449 --> 02:26.448
What? Lily, come on.

02:26.450 --> 02:27.983
You got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

02:27.985 --> 02:31.102
Dude, look who it is.

02:31.104 --> 02:32.938
And who should walk in but...

02:32.940 --> 02:35.490
Daddy's home.

02:35.492 --> 02:37.459
Nope.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.629
Well, well, Ted Mosby,
my old nemesis.

02:40.631 --> 02:41.880
What are you doing here?

02:41.882 --> 02:44.950
Um, well, uh,
Lily saw an ad for this...

02:44.952 --> 02:46.084
Gallery?

02:46.086 --> 02:48.787
So we... we came
to check out the...

02:48.789 --> 02:50.255
Artwork.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.558
And then we ran into...

02:52.560 --> 02:53.759
Me.

02:53.761 --> 02:55.394
<i>Man, this guy's so rude.</i>

02:55.396 --> 02:57.462
<i>I mean, I get why he's mad.</i>

02:57.464 --> 03:00.265
<i>I did stick it</i>
<i>to his ex-wife... repeatedly.</i>

03:00.267 --> 03:02.351
<i>Still, he's being a jerk.</i>

03:02.353 --> 03:05.020
<i>Someone needs</i>
<i>to bring him down a peg.</i>

03:05.022 --> 03:06.805
I'm sorry. Where are my...

03:06.807 --> 03:08.690
Manners.

03:08.692 --> 03:11.159
That's how that feels.

03:11.161 --> 03:12.411
This is my art
consultant.

03:12.413 --> 03:13.946
Shelly.

03:13.948 --> 03:15.781
Art consultant? What's that?

03:15.783 --> 03:17.366
Oh, Shelly helps the Captain

03:17.368 --> 03:19.117
select artwork
based on its aesthetic appeal

03:19.119 --> 03:21.336
and value
as an investment.

03:21.338 --> 03:23.956
That's why I think
she's gonna love

03:23.958 --> 03:25.490
this elephant painting.

03:25.492 --> 03:28.326
I think this artist
is going places.

03:28.328 --> 03:29.428
Well, I should go.

03:29.430 --> 03:31.263
Captain, we'll
talk tomorrow?

03:31.265 --> 03:32.764
At ease.

03:32.766 --> 03:34.883
Hey, if you like art,

03:34.885 --> 03:36.852
you should see the painting
I just acquired.

03:36.854 --> 03:39.104
It's in my apartment
just upstairs.

03:39.939 --> 03:43.942
It's gonna blow you away.

03:45.278 --> 03:47.229
Anyone with this kind
of ashtray money

03:47.231 --> 03:49.731
probably has an island
where he hunts people.

03:49.733 --> 03:51.950
Probably somewhere
in the Caribbean.

03:51.952 --> 03:55.120
I bet there's good snorkeling.

03:56.990 --> 03:58.690
Hello, my darling,

03:58.692 --> 04:02.127
my one true love, my everything.

04:02.129 --> 04:03.328
So, who wants to see

04:03.330 --> 04:04.963
that painting?

04:04.965 --> 04:06.832
Okay, Captain, we know why

04:06.834 --> 04:08.166
you brought us up here.
It's, uh...

04:08.168 --> 04:09.635
it's about me and Zoey.

04:09.637 --> 04:11.003
Ted,

04:11.005 --> 04:14.372
if you've got something
to say,

04:14.374 --> 04:16.475
say it.

04:16.476 --> 04:17.676
A harpoon gun?

04:17.678 --> 04:19.728
A double-barreled
harpoon gun.

04:19.730 --> 04:21.430
One barrel.

04:21.432 --> 04:22.514
With a scope.

04:22.516 --> 04:24.182
No scope.

04:24.184 --> 04:26.268
I know you're upset, Captain,
but I promise you

04:26.270 --> 04:27.686
nothing happened
between me and Zoey

04:27.688 --> 04:29.187
until after you guys
split up, okay?

04:29.189 --> 04:30.322
So let's...

04:30.324 --> 04:32.858
Let's please,
just-just-just put this down.

04:32.860 --> 04:36.028
Okay? Okay,
oh, there we go.

04:36.030 --> 04:38.396
Look, Ted,

04:38.398 --> 04:39.498
I'm not mad at you.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.949
The truth is
I'm in love

04:40.951 --> 04:43.118
with somebody else now,
so we're fine.

04:43.120 --> 04:47.005
Just don't steal this one
from me, too, okay?

04:47.573 --> 04:48.790
Okay?

04:48.792 --> 04:50.208
Of course.

04:50.210 --> 04:52.911
I promise.
Okay.

04:52.913 --> 04:54.546
But that got me thinking.

04:54.548 --> 04:56.214
Who was this new
lady in his life?

04:56.216 --> 04:58.917
I-I had this weird
sinking feeling.

04:58.919 --> 05:00.352
We both did.

05:00.354 --> 05:01.353
I had to see that picture.

05:01.355 --> 05:03.271
<i>So I waited until everyone</i>

05:03.273 --> 05:05.757
was out of the room, and then...

05:07.000 --> 05:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:15.318 --> 05:16.985
<i>Boats, boats, boats!</i>

05:16.987 --> 05:18.236
No.

05:18.238 --> 05:21.123
No...!

05:21.125 --> 05:23.909
She's "boats, boats, boats,"
and he's the Captain.

05:23.911 --> 05:25.627
That's sweet;
I'm happy for those two.

05:25.629 --> 05:26.995
Ted, you suck.

05:29.133 --> 05:31.033
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

05:31.035 --> 05:32.634
It's him, it's him.
What do I do?

05:32.636 --> 05:34.136
What do I do?
Ted, wait a second.

05:34.138 --> 05:36.338
What do I do?
Wait a second. Wait a second!

05:36.340 --> 05:39.791
Hey, is there any chance
that he is calling

05:39.793 --> 05:42.811
to invite the three of
us out on his boat?

05:42.813 --> 05:45.680
Uh, I don't know,
maybe like one percent.

05:45.682 --> 05:48.299
Ted's phone. Hold for Ted.

05:49.802 --> 05:51.353
Hello.

05:51.355 --> 05:53.021
Ted, I'm gonna
ask you something,

05:53.023 --> 05:56.441
and I want you
to be completely honest.

05:56.443 --> 05:59.111
What's your friend
Robin's number?

05:59.113 --> 06:00.495
What?

06:00.497 --> 06:02.664
Ted, ask about the boat.

06:07.295 --> 06:09.515
Uh, Captain, can...
can I put you on hold?

06:09.715 --> 06:11.014
Affirmative.

06:12.368 --> 06:14.586
He wants Robin's number.

06:14.588 --> 06:15.871
Should I give it to him?

06:15.873 --> 06:18.173
Is he trying to hook up
with my fiancée?

06:18.175 --> 06:19.541
No, uh-uh.

06:19.543 --> 06:20.775
The only way that's happening

06:20.777 --> 06:22.911
is if I get to hook up
with someone, too.

06:22.913 --> 06:24.513
Wait a second... No.

06:24.515 --> 06:26.781
Unless... Absolutely not.

06:26.783 --> 06:28.216
However... Forget it.

06:28.218 --> 06:29.801
On the other hand... Ixnay!

06:29.803 --> 06:32.938
Guys, guys,
I got to make a decision here.

06:32.940 --> 06:34.806
Okay, you know
what, I say do it.

06:34.808 --> 06:36.057
If it is a booty call,

06:36.059 --> 06:37.526
then Robin will just
let him down easy,

06:37.528 --> 06:39.594
but in the meantime, Ted is back
on the Captain's good side.

06:39.596 --> 06:42.030
We all get to go out on his
boat; I get to steer it.

06:42.032 --> 06:43.264
Everybody wins.

06:43.266 --> 06:44.599
Okay.

06:44.601 --> 06:46.701
Fine. Give him her number.

06:46.703 --> 06:48.102
You don't think she'll mind?

06:48.104 --> 06:49.237
I don't think she'll mind.

06:49.239 --> 06:51.223
You gave the Captain my number?

06:51.225 --> 06:52.407
She minds.

06:52.409 --> 06:53.942
Do you not remember that night

06:53.944 --> 06:56.611
we hung out with him
at the art show?

06:56.613 --> 06:58.046
Oh, right, of course
you don't remember

06:58.048 --> 06:59.247
because,
earlier that night,

06:59.249 --> 07:01.249
you shared a big,
fat sandwich with Becky.

07:01.251 --> 07:03.785
Boats, boats, boats!

07:03.787 --> 07:07.255
What's this
a commercial for again?

07:07.257 --> 07:08.423
Yeah, so?

07:08.425 --> 07:10.559
I hardly think that
changes the story.

07:10.561 --> 07:12.394
Mmm. Mmm.

07:12.396 --> 07:13.595
Delicious!

07:13.597 --> 07:16.314
This place is so fancy.

07:16.316 --> 07:18.233
I hope I don't embarrass myself.

07:18.235 --> 07:19.401
Oh, come on, Lily.

07:19.403 --> 07:21.302
You got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

07:24.407 --> 07:25.907
Dude, look who's here.

07:25.909 --> 07:27.308
Daddy's home.

07:29.262 --> 07:31.613
Nope.
Nope.

07:31.615 --> 07:32.581
Well, well.

07:33.617 --> 07:35.250
Ted Mosby, my old nemesis.

07:35.252 --> 07:36.451
What are you doing here?

07:36.453 --> 07:39.754
Well, Lily...

07:39.756 --> 07:42.707
saw an ad for this...

07:46.679 --> 07:48.463
Gallery.

07:50.266 --> 07:52.267
So we thought we'd, um...

07:52.269 --> 07:54.469
come and check out the...

07:57.690 --> 07:59.224
Artwork?

08:02.278 --> 08:05.981
And then we ran into...

08:08.818 --> 08:10.068
Me?

08:10.070 --> 08:12.020
<i>And the Captain</i>
<i>wasn't glaring at you.</i>

08:12.022 --> 08:13.655
<i>He couldn't take</i>
<i>his eyes off...</i>

08:13.657 --> 08:15.189
Hey, nice to see you again.

08:15.191 --> 08:16.408
Yeah, you, too.

08:16.410 --> 08:17.709
Oh.

08:17.711 --> 08:19.995
Man, this guy is so rude.

08:19.997 --> 08:21.463
I mean, I get
why he's upset.

08:21.465 --> 08:25.533
I did stick it
to his ex-wife... repeatedly.

08:25.535 --> 08:27.385
Still,

08:27.387 --> 08:28.586
the guy's being a jerk.

08:28.588 --> 08:30.922
Someone needs
to take him down a peg.

08:30.924 --> 08:32.724
Sorry.

08:32.726 --> 08:34.476
Where are my manners?

08:34.477 --> 08:36.811
This is Shelly,
my art consultant.

08:36.813 --> 08:38.480
Art consultant?
What's that?

08:38.482 --> 08:40.597
Shelly helps the Captain
select artwork

08:40.600 --> 08:41.883
based on aesthetic...

08:41.885 --> 08:43.684
Manners!

08:43.687 --> 08:46.271
That's how that feels.

08:48.724 --> 08:51.026
...appeal

08:51.028 --> 08:53.411
and value
as an investment,

08:53.413 --> 08:55.229
and that's why I think
she's gonna love

08:55.231 --> 08:56.531
this elephant painting.

08:56.533 --> 08:59.784
I think this artist
is going places.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.253
Well, I should go.

09:02.255 --> 09:05.290
Captain, we'll
talk tomorrow.

09:05.292 --> 09:08.093
If you like art,

09:08.095 --> 09:11.046
you should see the painting
I just acquired.

09:12.214 --> 09:16.718
It's gonna blow you away.

09:17.636 --> 09:19.754
Snorkeling.

09:19.756 --> 09:21.773
<i>Then, after I saved you</i>
<i>from destroying</i>

09:21.775 --> 09:23.257
a priceless crystal ashtray...

09:23.259 --> 09:25.143
<i>You're welcome.</i>

09:26.145 --> 09:27.479
Hello, my darling,

09:27.481 --> 09:30.315
my one true love, my everything.

09:30.317 --> 09:32.901
Ahoy?

09:34.787 --> 09:36.654
So who wants to see
that painting?

09:36.656 --> 09:38.990
Okay, Captain.

09:38.992 --> 09:41.960
We all know why
you brought us up here.

09:41.962 --> 09:45.213
This is about me and, um...

09:45.215 --> 09:47.132
Zoey.

09:47.134 --> 09:49.334
All right, Ted.

09:49.336 --> 09:50.952
If you've got something to say,

09:50.954 --> 09:53.638
say it.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.006
Whoa, whoa.

09:55.008 --> 09:56.124
A remote control?

09:56.126 --> 09:57.291
A remote control.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.761
Let's relax.

09:59.763 --> 10:02.230
I-I know you're upset, Captain.

10:02.232 --> 10:04.265
I-I just...
I want to assure you

10:04.267 --> 10:06.167
nothing happened
between me and Zoey

10:06.169 --> 10:08.269
until after you
guys had split up.

10:08.271 --> 10:10.105
So let's just...
let's just...

10:10.107 --> 10:11.940
let's put this down.

10:11.942 --> 10:15.476
Okay, okay.

10:15.478 --> 10:17.645
There we go.

10:19.148 --> 10:21.616
Ted, I'm not mad at you.

10:21.618 --> 10:22.917
Truth is, I'm in love

10:22.919 --> 10:25.820
with somebody else now.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.791
So he invited me back
to his bedroom

10:29.793 --> 10:31.876
to show me
this painting, and...

10:32.762 --> 10:34.129
Finally.

10:34.131 --> 10:35.630
We're alone.

10:35.632 --> 10:37.265
<i>Robin, no, I don't want</i>

10:37.267 --> 10:38.883
to picture that.
Nothing happened.

10:38.885 --> 10:41.436
Aw, that means hand stuff.
What?

10:41.438 --> 10:42.604
No.

10:42.606 --> 10:44.355
I'm serious--
he was on the rebound.

10:44.357 --> 10:48.026
I told him to take some time
to pull himself together and...

10:48.028 --> 10:49.861
call me in a year
and a half.

10:49.863 --> 10:51.529
Ah, great.

10:51.531 --> 10:52.864
What if he asks you out?

10:52.866 --> 10:55.450
What does that mean
for our relationship?

10:55.452 --> 10:58.536
What, are we planning to be
in some super-enlightened,

10:58.538 --> 11:00.288
forward-thinking marriage,

11:00.290 --> 11:03.158
where we don't get hung
up on the suffocating

11:03.160 --> 11:05.577
and outdated principles
of monogamy,

11:05.579 --> 11:06.911
and instead enjoy

11:06.913 --> 11:08.580
the company of
multiple partners,

11:08.582 --> 11:12.366
sometimes bringing said
partners into our marital bed,

11:12.368 --> 11:14.535
but just girls, not dudes,

11:14.537 --> 11:16.671
except maybe one time just
to see what that's like?

11:16.673 --> 11:19.207
I mean, is that
what you want?

11:19.892 --> 11:21.142
No.

11:21.144 --> 11:23.178
Okay.

11:23.180 --> 11:25.180
Me, neither!

11:25.182 --> 11:27.599
Okay, Robin, look,
you-you need to call the Captain

11:27.601 --> 11:30.068
and let him down easy, okay?

11:30.070 --> 11:32.237
Let him move on
with his life.

11:32.239 --> 11:35.389
Let him go out on his boat
with his old friends,

11:35.391 --> 11:37.742
maybe some new friends.

11:37.744 --> 11:41.029
Maybe let one of those
new friends steer the boat.

11:41.031 --> 11:44.082
Just so that one
of them could say,

11:44.084 --> 11:47.202
"Iceberg straighthead!"

11:47.204 --> 11:49.204
Fine.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.042
Ahoy.

11:54.044 --> 11:56.410
Hi. Captain, it's Robin.

11:57.129 --> 11:57.962
Ahoy.

11:57.964 --> 11:59.514
Uh, look,

11:59.516 --> 12:01.432
I, uh, have to be
upfront with you.

12:01.434 --> 12:02.800
I'm engaged.

12:02.802 --> 12:04.919
Engaged? I thought you
were married to Marshall.

12:04.921 --> 12:07.105
This is Robin right?

12:07.107 --> 12:08.439
The redheaded
kindergarten teacher

12:08.441 --> 12:10.508
who wore the gray dress
and the blue shoes

12:10.510 --> 12:11.860
to that art show?

12:11.862 --> 12:13.561
Can you please
hold a moment?

12:13.563 --> 12:14.896
Dropping anchor.

12:16.065 --> 12:18.199
He's looking for Lily.

12:18.201 --> 12:20.151
Should I give him
her number?

12:20.153 --> 12:22.620
Yeah. We've already
discussed it.

12:22.622 --> 12:24.605
It's $4 million cash.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.658
Oh, her phone number.

12:26.660 --> 12:28.276
Yes, I don't think
she'll mind.

12:28.278 --> 12:30.628
You gave the Captain my number?

12:30.630 --> 12:32.881
She minds.

12:33.716 --> 12:35.583
It finally happened.

12:35.585 --> 12:38.136
My past finally caught up
with me.

12:38.138 --> 12:39.254
Oh, God.

12:39.256 --> 12:40.922
Lily, if you tell me that you

12:40.924 --> 12:42.757
slept with the Captain
for anything under 2.8,

12:42.759 --> 12:45.293
which we agreed was as low
as we were going to go...

12:45.295 --> 12:47.428
No, it's nothing like that.

12:47.430 --> 12:50.631
Do you guys remember the
last time we saw the Captain?

12:50.633 --> 12:52.066
- Yes.
- Oh, right.

12:52.068 --> 12:54.836
Of course you don't.
Barney, you weren't there.

12:54.838 --> 12:57.021
Ted, you had just floated out
of a Snoop Dogg B-side.

12:57.023 --> 12:59.157
And, Robin,
you had just come from that

12:59.159 --> 13:01.276
big meeting that ran long.

13:07.483 --> 13:10.151
Delicious. Shrimpy for me.

13:10.153 --> 13:11.953
This place
is so fancy.

13:11.955 --> 13:14.539
I hope I don't
embarrass myself.

13:14.541 --> 13:17.759
Come on, Lily, you have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

13:19.545 --> 13:20.795
Dude!

13:20.797 --> 13:22.330
Look who's here!

13:22.332 --> 13:23.381
Daddy's...

13:23.383 --> 13:25.717
Nope.
Nope.

13:25.719 --> 13:27.485
Well, well.

13:27.487 --> 13:29.220
Ted Mosby, my old nemesis.

13:29.222 --> 13:32.223
Hello, sailor.

13:32.225 --> 13:33.391
<i>No!</i>

13:33.393 --> 13:36.945
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

13:36.947 --> 13:39.731
Okay, yeah,
that's what happened.

13:39.733 --> 13:42.150
This is Shelly,
my art consultant.

13:43.119 --> 13:44.619
Art consultant!

13:44.621 --> 13:46.437
What's that?

13:46.439 --> 13:48.189
Shelly helps the Captain
select artwork

13:48.191 --> 13:50.241
based on its aesthetic appeal

13:50.243 --> 13:52.026
and its value
as an investment,

13:52.028 --> 13:54.495
which is why I think
she's gonna love

13:54.497 --> 13:55.863
this elephant painting.

13:55.865 --> 13:59.584
I think this artist
is going places.

13:59.586 --> 14:02.420
You'd have to be a real Dumbo
not to enjoy this painting.

14:02.422 --> 14:03.388
Get it?

14:03.390 --> 14:04.922
'Cause he's an elephant?

14:04.924 --> 14:08.476
Your sense of humor is as
good as your taste in art.

14:08.478 --> 14:10.345
Captain?

14:10.347 --> 14:11.712
We'll talk tomorrow?

14:13.265 --> 14:14.649
If you like art,

14:14.651 --> 14:16.684
you should see the painting
I just acquired.

14:16.686 --> 14:17.735
It's in my...

14:17.737 --> 14:19.404
Manners.

14:19.406 --> 14:21.222
That's how that feels.

14:24.193 --> 14:27.161
In my apartment right upstairs.

14:27.163 --> 14:29.364
It's gonna blow you away.

14:29.366 --> 14:31.582
Snorkeling.

14:31.584 --> 14:34.168
<i>Then, after I saved you</i>
<i>from destroying</i>

14:34.170 --> 14:35.503
a priceless crystal ashtray...

14:35.505 --> 14:36.954
<i>You're welcome.</i>

14:39.708 --> 14:42.576
Hello, my darling,
my one true love, my everything.

14:45.097 --> 14:48.850
So, who wants
to see that painting?

14:48.852 --> 14:50.968
Ooh, if you
show me yours,

14:50.970 --> 14:53.421
I'll show you mine.

14:53.423 --> 14:55.423
So we check out the painting.

14:55.425 --> 14:57.675
Huh. You know,

14:57.677 --> 15:00.028
that elephant painting
would look nice in here.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.562
You're looking at a masterpiece,

15:01.564 --> 15:04.032
and you're talking
about some elephant painting?

15:04.034 --> 15:06.984
No...!

15:06.986 --> 15:10.121
Oh, this one's nice, too.

15:10.123 --> 15:13.157
I just like
the elephant painting better.

15:13.159 --> 15:17.712
You know, it doesn't matter
what you like.

15:17.714 --> 15:20.214
You're just
a kindergarten teacher.

15:21.467 --> 15:23.718
Ah, finally we're alone.

15:31.094 --> 15:33.311
Oh, no, Lily, what did you do?

15:33.313 --> 15:35.163
He was a jerk--
he deserved to have

15:35.165 --> 15:37.348
that precious painting stolen.

15:37.350 --> 15:39.067
Oh, God, Lily, you didn't...?

15:39.069 --> 15:40.601
Of course I didn't.

15:41.403 --> 15:43.688
I stole this ashtray instead.

15:48.137 --> 15:50.432
Lily!
Hey, you know the rules.

15:50.532 --> 15:53.700
You misbehave, I take away
one of your toys.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.418
Aldrin Justice, baby.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.137
So you're telling me
that that ashtray

15:57.139 --> 15:58.571
that's been in our apartment

15:58.573 --> 16:00.173
for over a year and a half

16:00.175 --> 16:02.459
is not only stolen,
but also very expensive.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.294
Both of those things-- yes.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.796
Guys, can you leave us alone
for a minute, please?

16:06.798 --> 16:08.798
Ooh, they're gonna do it.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.050
No, we're gonna fight.

16:11.052 --> 16:13.386
And then maybe afterwards
we'll do it.

16:14.772 --> 16:16.006
I can't believe

16:16.008 --> 16:17.357
that was the same ashtray.

16:17.359 --> 16:18.942
I should've recognized it.

16:18.944 --> 16:20.944
I know-- me, too.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.762
Barney, you weren't there.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.264
Why is it so important that
you be part of this story?

16:25.266 --> 16:28.034
Because crazy stories
are my thing.

16:28.036 --> 16:29.486
You have architecture,

16:29.488 --> 16:30.620
Marshall has the law,

16:30.622 --> 16:31.821
Lily has art,

16:31.823 --> 16:33.657
Robin has pleasing
me sexually.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.076
You all have a passion
that drives you.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.944
Well, if I have a passion,
it's taking life

16:37.946 --> 16:40.330
and turning it into a
series of crazy stories.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.083
If you can do that
without me, then...

16:43.085 --> 16:46.386
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

16:49.623 --> 16:50.924
You know what, Barney?

16:50.926 --> 16:53.426
Now that I think about it,

16:53.428 --> 16:54.794
you were there.

16:54.796 --> 16:55.729
That's right, you were.

16:55.731 --> 16:56.763
I was?
Yeah.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.297
I mean, I know I was.

16:58.299 --> 17:00.850
That's what I'm
saying, guys.

17:00.852 --> 17:04.604
We just, uh... we just didn't
realize it because...

17:04.606 --> 17:06.406
you were in disguise.

17:06.407 --> 17:07.691
Yeah, you were doing, uh,

17:07.693 --> 17:09.409
one of your plays
from the playbook.

17:09.411 --> 17:11.578
On Shelly, the art consultant.

17:11.579 --> 17:14.280
Yes, it was, uh, some play
that had to do with art...

17:14.281 --> 17:16.983
The Royal Archduke
of Grand Fenwick?

17:16.984 --> 17:18.585
A simple play
you can do

17:18.587 --> 17:20.837
using two everyday
household objects--

17:20.839 --> 17:22.155
a Prussian
military costume

17:22.156 --> 17:23.673
and an oil painting
of yourself?

17:23.675 --> 17:26.542
That's the one,
and it worked on Shelly.

17:27.377 --> 17:28.828
I totally nailed her!

17:28.830 --> 17:31.464
And then I nailed her sister
who was even hotter.

17:33.051 --> 17:35.185
Good times.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.336
You are gonna return that
ashtray, and you're gonna pray

17:37.338 --> 17:39.439
that he doesn't press charges,
because I can't be

17:39.441 --> 17:41.507
in a marriage where
one of us is in prison.

17:41.509 --> 17:43.393
I know that we role-play
conjugal visits a lot,

17:43.395 --> 17:45.395
but I can't do that
for realsies.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.180
I'm sorry--
all rulings are final.

17:47.182 --> 17:48.748
I am not taking it back.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.366
Oh, my God!

17:50.368 --> 17:51.451
Lily,

17:51.453 --> 17:53.119
what is the big deal?

17:53.121 --> 17:54.370
Okay, so what?

17:54.372 --> 17:56.372
So he said you're just
a kindergarten teacher.

17:56.374 --> 17:57.907
Why do you let that bother you?

17:57.909 --> 17:59.209
Because he was right.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.327
I am just
a kindergarten teacher.

18:01.329 --> 18:02.962
And, yes,
I have a degree

18:02.964 --> 18:05.582
in art history and I was meant
to do something with it,

18:05.584 --> 18:06.833
but I didn't.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.201
Somewhere along
the line,

18:08.203 --> 18:10.804
I forgot to pursue
my dream, and...

18:10.806 --> 18:14.424
and now I'm old and I'm a mom
and it's just too late for me.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.759
Lily, okay, okay.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.376
It's too late.
No, no, no, it's not too...

18:17.378 --> 18:18.845
it's not too late.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.730
You're gonna quit
your job tomorrow,

18:20.732 --> 18:23.650
and you're gonna...
you're gonna go back and pick up

18:23.652 --> 18:25.819
right where you left off
with that art stuff.

18:25.821 --> 18:27.386
And then you know what?

18:27.388 --> 18:30.607
I'm gonna find Shelly, and I'm
gonna punch her in the face.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.826
I am-- I'm gonna
punch a girl...

18:32.828 --> 18:34.727
and run away.

18:34.729 --> 18:37.280
Look.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.998
I promise you,

18:39.000 --> 18:42.252
your best
and your most exciting days

18:42.254 --> 18:44.420
are all ahead of you.

18:45.239 --> 18:49.108
I love you so much
for saying that,

18:49.110 --> 18:51.928
but there gets to be
a point in life

18:51.930 --> 18:55.014
where that just
stops being true.

18:56.183 --> 18:59.052
I'm sorry I stole this.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.854
I'll return it
first thing tomorrow.

19:00.856 --> 19:03.273
<i>And so the next day,</i>
<i>Lily returned</i>

19:03.275 --> 19:05.058
<i>to the Captain's apartment.</i>

19:05.060 --> 19:06.559
Well, how about that.

19:06.561 --> 19:08.394
I didn't even realize
it was gone.

19:08.396 --> 19:10.947
No harm done.

19:10.949 --> 19:13.733
Wait, if you weren't calling
about the ashtray,

19:13.735 --> 19:15.485
then why'd you want to see me?

19:15.487 --> 19:16.870
Follow me.

19:20.774 --> 19:22.208
Oh, my gosh.

19:22.210 --> 19:24.878
Yep, that night,
I ducked back down

19:24.880 --> 19:26.579
into the gallery and bought it.

19:26.581 --> 19:28.281
Shelly didn't stop you?

19:28.283 --> 19:31.084
Shelly was off with some
archduke she met at the party.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.469
No, I just... well,

19:33.471 --> 19:36.005
I liked what you said
about how you just liked it.

19:36.007 --> 19:37.757
I still do.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.893
Me, too.

19:39.895 --> 19:41.792
Anyway, I just sold
it for $4 million.

19:41.817 --> 19:42.680
What?

19:42.681 --> 19:45.098
In the year and a half
since I bought this piece,

19:45.100 --> 19:48.067
the artist has turned into
a huge star in the art world.

19:48.069 --> 19:50.103
The next Basquiat,
they're saying.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.988
And nobody saw it coming
except you.

19:51.990 --> 19:55.608
So I've decided to give you
half my earnings from the sale.

19:55.610 --> 19:57.476
I'm just kidding.

19:57.478 --> 19:59.495
I'm not giving you
two million bucks.

19:59.497 --> 20:01.647
I mean, I could.

20:01.649 --> 20:03.816
Easily-- it wouldn't even
make a dent for me.

20:03.818 --> 20:06.703
But trust me,
the tax code being what it is,

20:06.705 --> 20:08.955
you do not want
to be rich right now.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.707
So here's what I'm thinking.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.675
I want to get back
in the art game,

20:12.677 --> 20:15.595
and I need a new art consultant.

20:16.297 --> 20:19.632
Wait, are you offering me a job?

20:19.634 --> 20:21.134
If you want it.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.886
What do you say?

20:24.021 --> 20:25.772
And she said yes.
Guys, it was amazing!

20:25.774 --> 20:27.006
You should have been there.
Barney!

20:27.008 --> 20:28.441
You were not there.
Let her tell her story.

20:28.443 --> 20:29.576
Guys!
You were not there.

20:29.578 --> 20:32.445
What did you say, baby?

20:32.447 --> 20:34.113
I said yes.

20:34.115 --> 20:35.514
Ha! Told you!

20:35.516 --> 20:38.585
How would I know that
she was going to say...?
