‐ I'm just saying
it's like that for a reason.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.210
There's a story there, man.

27:48.210 --> 27:49.211
‐ Oh, I get it.

27:56.552 --> 27:57.636
It's good to see you, Rob.

27:58.762 --> 27:59.680
‐ Yeah, you too.

28:04.434 --> 28:08.021
‐ I'm sorry we never really talked
after everything went down, you know.

28:08.397 --> 28:09.815
‐ Yeah. Me too.

28:11.942 --> 28:14.736
The whole "moving across the Atlantic"
thing didn't really give me

28:15.529 --> 28:17.114
a "let's talk about it" vibe.

28:17.114 --> 28:17.823
So‐‐

28:19.408 --> 28:20.492
‐ Yeah, well.

28:21.368 --> 28:23.161
You know, I tried to talk to you, Rob,

28:23.161 --> 28:25.998
I tried over and over, but you
don't listen, you never listened.

28:25.998 --> 28:27.749
‐ Oh, I, I never listened?

28:27.749 --> 28:30.252
I nev‐‐ I nev‐‐ Okay. All right.

28:31.503 --> 28:32.504
Interesting.

28:33.422 --> 28:34.923
And, um,
[clears throat]

28:34.923 --> 28:36.592
Lily, she's a, she's a good listener?

28:36.592 --> 28:38.343
‐ Oh, Jesus Christ!
‐ What? No, no, I just wanna know.

28:38.343 --> 28:41.054
She understands you? She nods
at all the right times and stuff?

28:42.264 --> 28:43.265
‐ What do you want, Rob?

28:50.147 --> 28:51.148
‐ I‐‐

28:52.524 --> 28:53.483
I want you to‐‐

28:55.027 --> 28:57.321
I want you to tell me that
it's not serious between you two.

28:58.864 --> 29:02.075
I want you to tell me
that you haven't proposed... yet.

29:03.744 --> 29:05.245
And I want that to be the truth.

29:07.998 --> 29:08.999
‐ Uh‐‐

29:14.171 --> 29:15.589
I can't do that, Rob.

29:22.638 --> 29:24.473
‐ Okay. Okay.

29:25.557 --> 29:26.558
[door slams shut]

29:27.226 --> 29:30.229
[breathing heavily]

29:33.273 --> 29:36.527
Why couldn't I just... ask him?

29:37.152 --> 29:38.362
I asked all the others.

29:38.862 --> 29:40.614
I mean, that's what I went there
to do, right?

29:40.614 --> 29:42.950
And I fucking choked.

29:44.493 --> 29:46.870
Instead, I ask him if he's engaged?

29:48.664 --> 29:50.332
And he's engaged.

29:52.334 --> 29:53.377
