<i>- Tonight on st. Elsewhere.
- That's very Good. You seem
to be an old hand at this.</i>

00:04.775 --> 00:08.708
I hear you put in
a pacemaker today
with your own two hands.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.643
He did not need
that pacemaker.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.146
Well, I would think
long and hard, young lady,

00:13.212 --> 00:17.016
before I started
tossing around
such serious Accusations.

00:17.083 --> 00:20.219
<i>- You mean you don't know
who this guy is?
- Harold hubner.</i>

00:20.286 --> 00:24.223

this is a world-Class

00:24.290 --> 00:26.692
Sex has never been
particularly important
to me.

00:26.759 --> 00:28.561
I think what you do
is Immoral.

00:28.628 --> 00:30.663
Where's the laundry ticket?
What laundry ticket?

00:30.730 --> 00:33.399
Thirty-Six hours on call,
some of us like to go home,

00:33.466 --> 00:35.668
have a nice shower
and put on some
clean clothes.

00:35.735 --> 00:38.404
Does this mean you're gonna
withhold sexual favors from me
again tonight, Victor?

00:38.471 --> 00:41.107
You want your shirt?
Here's your shirt!
Yes.

00:41.174 --> 00:44.143
Don't you dare rip that!
Don't you rip that!
There it is!

00:44.210 --> 00:48.581
There are only two reasons
why a surgeon would needlessly
operate on another human being--

00:48.648 --> 00:50.483
because he's crazy
or he's broke.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.920
Dr. Andrews is
a very successful...

00:53.986 --> 00:55.922
and wealthy Surgeon.

00:55.988 --> 00:57.890
Why would he do
a thing like that?

00:57.957 --> 01:00.359
You're not gonna even bother
to find out if what I'm saying
is True.

01:00.426 --> 01:02.595

03:17.130 --> 03:19.866
Oh, yeah. Long month.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.803
Hear from Nancy Paxton?

03:23.870 --> 03:25.805
Nope.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.241
Well, it takes a while
to get settled.

03:28.307 --> 03:30.610
Yeah, I guess.

03:30.676 --> 03:33.880
Mail's a little slow
from Cleveland.

03:33.946 --> 03:36.482
So, what'd you do
to drive her away
this time?

03:37.917 --> 03:40.553
That was a low blow.
I'm sorry.

03:43.289 --> 03:47.160

03:58.404 --> 04:02.408
Wicked.
You're the prettiest doctor
I've ever seen.

04:02.475 --> 04:06.446
It says here
you have a duodenal ulcer.
How long have you had one?

04:06.512 --> 04:10.216
Since I was 15.
And you're in for
your six-Month tune-up?

04:10.283 --> 04:15.121
Hmm. I will be out of here
by tomorrow night, correct?
I would think so.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.490
Any chance I could get out
a little earlier?

04:17.557 --> 04:19.559
I have a rather
pressing Engagement.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.827
Catching the concorde

04:21.894 --> 04:25.698
The massachusetts turnpike.
I haven't lived in England
for 10 years.

04:27.967 --> 04:31.737
Confirmed Bachelor.
Used to be quite respectable,

04:31.804 --> 04:35.675
Are your parents living?
My mother-- in England.

04:37.076 --> 04:40.980
Any brothers or sisters?
Just me and mum.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.149
Where do you live?

04:43.216 --> 04:45.384
I'm sort of in transit
at the moment,

04:45.451 --> 04:47.954
but I will be living
in west dorset, vermont.

04:49.155 --> 04:52.258
And your profession?
I deal in rare books.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.965
Well, Mr. Hubner,

We'll get you started on
the upper g.I. Series bright
and early tomorrow morning.

Mark.

05:19.385 --> 05:22.321
Caught your article
on cardiomyopathies
in this week's journal.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.390
What'd you think?
Not bad, not bad.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.392
Well researched,
thorough.

05:26.459 --> 05:29.796
Not exactly Hemingway, but,
uh-- No offense intended--

05:29.862 --> 05:32.298
Gotta get 'em to turn
the page, Larry.

05:32.365 --> 05:35.668
A little dry,
you think?
As a bone.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.871
<i>Strunk and, uh, white,
elements of style.</i>

05:38.938 --> 05:40.907
You oughta read that.

05:40.973 --> 05:43.576
I noticed that Ehrlich
assisted in the open-Heart
on Monday.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.645
Did he cut the mustard?
Very Well.

05:45.711 --> 05:49.182
And brummer?
Still shaking?
Tremors of intention.

05:49.248 --> 05:51.951
No problem.
What about Dr. Armstrong?

05:52.018 --> 05:54.720
Who?
Wendy Armstrong,

05:54.787 --> 05:57.290
Ah. She seems
very capable.
I'm glad to hear that.

05:57.356 --> 06:01.060
She has a very good attitude,
and-- Thank god--
She can speak the language.

06:01.127 --> 06:03.062
Too much tennis?

06:03.129 --> 06:06.199
No, I've been shoveling snow
off my damn Driveway.

06:06.265 --> 06:08.267
That house is Getting
too much for me.

06:08.334 --> 06:11.804
My house is on the market,
if you're interested.
I don't think so.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.973
Short driveway.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.243
It's a little too modern
for my taste, though my wife
is Crazy about it.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.446
This is my realtor,
in case you change
your mind.

06:20.513 --> 06:23.749
Oh, all right, Larry.

06:23.816 --> 06:27.587
I've been watching the way
you work, the way you move,
and I'm very impressed.

06:27.653 --> 06:31.991
You're efficient, you take
direction well and I like
the extra starch in the collar.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.361
So I was thinking maybe
you would come over
to my place sometime,

06:35.428 --> 06:38.097
and we could play
swedish maid
and the invalid.

06:38.164 --> 06:40.099
No spanking.
Fiscus.

06:40.166 --> 06:44.403
Later, Ehrlich.
One other thing--
Any communicable diseases?

06:44.470 --> 06:47.774
Which would you like?

06:47.840 --> 06:51.210
Ehrlich, I am this far away
from having an affair
with that broodmare.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.446
Where's
the laundry ticket?

06:53.513 --> 06:56.315
The woman is from texas.
She's broken in broncos.

06:56.382 --> 06:58.384
I-I can't let myself
Get too crazy.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.553
Where is
the laundry ticket?
What laundry ticket?

07:00.620 --> 07:03.289
You forgot
to bring it in again,
didn't ya?

07:03.356 --> 07:06.526
Temporary as it was intended,
you're staying at my place.
The laundry.

07:06.592 --> 07:09.395
And this is the third time
in two weeks I've asked you
to bring it in.

That's not funny.
One second, man.
Hey, Victor.

07:23.543 --> 07:26.579
Listen, three weeks ago
you were evicted,
out on the street.

07:26.646 --> 07:29.515
And I took you in out of
the goodness of my heart.
How have you repaid me?

07:29.582 --> 07:32.151

Okay, okay.

Be specific.
I'll be very specific,
okay?

Do you know why you didn't
happen to have a clean shirt?
Why?

08:15.027 --> 08:17.830

himself in here yesterday.

09:36.142 --> 09:39.278
There is nobody here

convention this week?

11:49.609 --> 11:51.544
No, I had to cancel.

My wife and I had some people
coming up to take photographs
of our house.

11:55.782 --> 11:59.552

Oh. You live in Ipswich,
don't you, Dr. Andrews?
Yes.

12:08.828 --> 12:12.431
You should see the house.
It's a beauty!

12:12.498 --> 12:16.569
Yes, we like it very much,
though the fact is We've
put it on the market.

a follow-Up x-Ray.
It won't take but a minute.

12:37.123 --> 12:41.494
Needed a change of venue,
so to speak, so I packed my bag
and hopped a flight to America.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.230
Just like that?
Actually, I thought
about it for a while.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.433

Nope.

You interested?
Sure!
How'd you get them?

13:17.897 --> 13:20.133
Uh, Nancy ordered them
about six weeks ago.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.102
It's not really my kind
of music, you know?

13:23.169 --> 13:25.805
Well, thanks a lot, Ben.
Sure. Anytime.

13:28.040 --> 13:32.445
Listen, uh,
what's with the count?
Who?

13:32.512 --> 13:34.981
Count Luis obispo.

13:35.047 --> 13:39.385
You mean you don't know
who this guy is?
Harold hubner.

13:39.452 --> 13:44.257
This is a world-Class
erotic film Star.
Harold?

13:44.323 --> 13:48.194
This is practically
the Laurence Olivier
of blue movies.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.731
<i>The count of Monte crisco,
uh, Byron on the Heath,</i>

13:51.798 --> 13:53.866
<i>uh, Theodora and justinian.</i>

13:53.933 --> 13:57.136
These classics don't
mean anything to you?
No.

13:57.203 --> 13:59.205
Well, I guess you're
not into film.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.941
That is one talented man.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.487
Something the matter?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.924
Are you
the count of Monte cristo?

14:19.325 --> 14:21.661
Oh.
Are you?

14:21.727 --> 14:25.898
Count Luis obispo.
I'm afraid so.

14:25.965 --> 14:28.301
You're a porno movie star?

14:30.236 --> 14:32.805
In a manner
of speaking, Yes.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.907
Why are you registered
as Harold hubner?

14:34.974 --> 14:37.643
I don't want certain persons
to know I'm here.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.313
You see,
I've been under contract
to Hyacinth pictures...

14:40.379 --> 14:42.748
to make five films,
of which I've made three.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.318
But I want to get out of
the motion picture Business.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.221
Hyacinth pictures
has been attempting
to serve me a summons...

14:48.287 --> 14:50.356
to fulfill the remainder
of my contract.

14:52.358 --> 14:56.996
Then all this talk
about rare books and
dorset, vermont, is a lie.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.998
No.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.567
I have an extraordinary
collection of rare books,

15:01.634 --> 15:04.403
and I reconverted a barn
in west dorset.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.806
Once I've disappeared
across the border,

15:06.873 --> 15:09.375
Mr. Bricker will be unable
to serve me the summons.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.445
His jurisdiction only
applies to the commonwealth
of massachusetts.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.447
Mr. Bricker?
The man Who's--

15:14.514 --> 15:18.117
Serving the summons.
Short, disheveled
character.

15:18.184 --> 15:20.219
You won't let on,
will you?

15:20.286 --> 15:23.723
[ sighs ]
I am not a fan
of porno movies,

15:23.790 --> 15:25.792
Mr. Whatever your name is,

15:25.858 --> 15:29.295
and I don't particularly
like being lied to.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.598
An orderly will be in
to take you to your room.

15:37.003 --> 15:41.808
The only reason I let
that idiot move in is he got
thrown out of his apartment.

15:41.874 --> 15:45.311
But it's like having a pet,
a barnyard animal--

15:45.378 --> 15:47.747
a pig, a cow.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.782
No offense Intended.

15:54.887 --> 15:58.658
Hey, Wendy.
How's your ankle?
Getting better.

15:58.724 --> 16:02.495
I hear you put in a pacemaker
today with your own two hands.
How'd it feel?

16:02.562 --> 16:05.231
Okay.
"Okay"? just okay?

16:05.298 --> 16:08.901
No rush, no thrill?
What's the matter?
You're not into ecstasy?

16:08.968 --> 16:13.005
Oh, it's not that.
It's the patient,
Mr. Standar.

16:13.072 --> 16:17.343
His arrhythmia on
the E.K.G. Monitor wasn't
significantly abnormal.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.446
Well, maybe his heart
was on good behavior today.

16:20.513 --> 16:24.450
Maybe.
But I gotta tell you
something, Victor.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.719
I don't think he needed
that pacemaker.

16:37.196 --> 16:40.032
<i>I saw a picture
of you in the globe
with that crowd of yours.</i>

16:40.099 --> 16:43.169
What crowd?
Oh, you know--
the Cobbs, the wheelers.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.171
Real fast company.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.241
I didn't know you read
the society page, mark.
I don't.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.810
My wife read it to me
over breakfast.

16:50.877 --> 16:55.014
I mean, the guest list sounded
like a who's who in Boston.
Real blue bloods.

16:55.081 --> 16:59.318
What was the occasion?
Fund-Raiser for
the Boston youth Society.

16:59.385 --> 17:03.389
My wife is always on me to get
with it with the social crowd.
You know, I--

17:03.456 --> 17:05.657
[ laughing ]
I'm curious, Larry.

17:05.724 --> 17:08.560
What did it cost you
for a seat at that table?

17:08.627 --> 17:10.663
2,500 a plate.
[ Coughing ]

17:10.730 --> 17:13.532
[ gasps ]
Well, it was for
a very good cause.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.536
Well, that's debatable.
[ laughing ]

17:18.237 --> 17:21.406
I'm serious. We've got
the complete collection
of Jan and Dean albums.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.709
What's this use
of the royal "We"?

17:23.776 --> 17:26.279
<i>excuse me. Victor has
the complete collection.</i>

17:26.345 --> 17:30.316
Yes, Victor also had the ENTIRE
beach boy collection till he
trashed one of the albums.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.385
What happened
to your hand?

17:32.452 --> 17:35.221
I got a cat
over the weekend.
Oh? What's his name?

17:35.288 --> 17:37.623
I haven't decided yet.

17:37.690 --> 17:41.060
Dear Abby says that
what you name your cat
says a lot about you.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.162
Well, if dear Abby
says so--

17:43.229 --> 17:47.333
I had a PSYCH professor who
once said if you call your cat
by An EVERYDAY human name,

17:47.400 --> 17:51.237
like Peter, Ralph or Alice,
you're obviously seeking
an emotional relationship.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.039
Watch the shirt, Fiscus.

17:53.106 --> 17:57.510
Whereas an IMPERSONAL name
like toronto, fresno
or houseboat...

17:57.577 --> 18:01.080
suggests a person afraid
of emotional attachment.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.950
Watch the shirt, Fiscus!
Relax, Victor.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.953
There are, in fact,
three names a cat must have.

18:07.019 --> 18:11.891
<i>Why three?
Well, first there is
his everyday name.</i>

18:11.958 --> 18:14.427
But then he must have
a special name...

18:14.494 --> 18:17.296
<i>to go with
the very special way
that a cat has.</i>

18:17.363 --> 18:19.298
<i>[ cavanero ]
like?</i>

18:19.365 --> 18:21.801
Well, like,
uh, minnaloushe...

18:21.868 --> 18:25.404
or balthersleite
or, uh, jellyrumpole.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.940
Bet those are really high
on your list.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.676
<i>But then there is
the third name.</i>

18:32.945 --> 18:35.515
Well?

18:36.582 --> 18:39.619
Well, it is
the most important name.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.121
It is a name
that you must find.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.859
Well, it is the name
that the cat himself Knows.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.268
[ Disgusted grunt ]

18:59.505 --> 19:03.476
excuse me. Know where
the men's room is?
Yeah. Around the corner.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.748
Oh, Dr. Cavanero.

19:08.815 --> 19:13.085
The staff on 4-W was wondering
if you could do us a favor.
Shoot.

19:13.152 --> 19:17.824
We were wondering if you
could get us an autographed
picture of the count.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.426
How did you know
he was in the hospital?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.662
Um, morgen heard it
from Caruso,

19:22.728 --> 19:25.698
<i>who recognized him
from his movie,
the battle of malden.</i>

19:25.765 --> 19:29.235
And we were thinking that
since you're his doctor,
you could get us one.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.537
I don't think he has
any photographs with him.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.706
We didn't think
that he would.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.242
Then how do you expect me
to get one for you?

19:36.309 --> 19:39.312
It's not wide-Angle,
but a profile shot'll do.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.280
<i>[ woman ]
Dr. Cavanero.</i>

19:42.315 --> 19:44.217
Yes?

19:45.451 --> 19:47.987
Dr. Cavanero,
this is Mr. Bricker.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.023
I hear you have
a patient here
with an ulcer.

19:51.090 --> 19:54.427
That's correct.
Yeah, well, I've got
a summons for him.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.429
Really?
That's right.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.764
What for?
Breach of contract.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.836
What did he do,
stiff the retirement home
for last month's rent?

20:03.903 --> 20:07.540
Is he an old guy?
Depends on
what you call old.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.910
Is 80 old?
God's sake!

20:14.647 --> 20:17.416
<i>[ woman ]
I need some help over here.
[ no audible Dialogue ]</i>

20:17.483 --> 20:19.485
<i>thank you.
[ man ]
okay. I'll wait.</i>

20:19.552 --> 20:23.389
We just found out.
I guess I'm eight weeks.
Really?

20:23.456 --> 20:25.958
We're real Excited.
That's Good.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.994
Say hi to Nina for me.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.231
<i>[ woman ]
St. Eligius Emergency.</i>

20:34.133 --> 20:36.436
Never thought I'd see you
working the room.

20:36.502 --> 20:40.406
She's Pregnant.
That's sick, Morrison.
Very, very sick.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.809
Your wife
must be getting close.
When's she due?

20:42.875 --> 20:45.278
Uh, first week in May.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.047
<i>Fiscus!
Oh.</i>

20:48.114 --> 20:50.483
Oh, hello, Dr. Mauri.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.819
Where were you
this morning?

20:52.885 --> 20:56.355
I don't know.
Where was I supposed to be?
Over at B.U., Fiscus.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.825
The lecture.
That's not until Friday.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.893
Didn't you get
my message?
No.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.964
I told your roommate that we
were on for this morning.
I didn't--

21:05.031 --> 21:07.600
There were 40 people there
this morning, Fiscus.

21:07.667 --> 21:11.604
You made me look like a fool.
It wasn't intentional.
It was a mistake.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.840
It's always a mistake
with you, isn't it?

21:13.906 --> 21:16.976
There are a lot
of residents around here that
could have done this lecture,

21:17.043 --> 21:18.978
but you seemed
most qualified.

21:19.045 --> 21:23.549
You made me look like
a fool, Fiscus, and I'm
not gonna forget this.

21:30.056 --> 21:34.694
How are you feeling?
Fine. And you?

21:34.760 --> 21:37.430
Mr. Bricker asked me
about you.

21:37.497 --> 21:40.166
Don't worry.
I lied for you.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.869
Thank you.
I have to check
your gastric juice.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.938
I'd like
to get you out of here
as soon as possible.

21:46.005 --> 21:49.308
Your x-Ray study
showed no active Ulcer.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.944
Why did you lie for me?

21:52.011 --> 21:54.480
I don't know.
I just did.

21:56.749 --> 21:59.519
Can I ask you
a question?
Anything.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.457
You seem like
an intelligent,
decent human being.

22:04.524 --> 22:07.760
What makes you do
porno movies?

22:07.827 --> 22:10.997
We prefer to call them
"Erotic films," but to
answer your question,

22:11.063 --> 22:14.100
I was down to my last dollar
and sitting in a restaurant
eating...

22:14.167 --> 22:17.537
when a man approached me
and asked me if I'd like
to be in a movie.

22:17.603 --> 22:21.741
He needed someone
with an english accent. Adds
a touch of class, you know.

22:21.808 --> 22:25.545
It's the truth.
They quickly discovered
that I had a--

22:25.611 --> 22:27.613
how shall I say it?
Talent.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.717
There are a lot of people
broke out there, but they
don't degrade themselves.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.787
Most of my movies
are quite funny Really.

22:34.854 --> 22:38.024
Victorian romances,
historical melodramas,
sweeping adventures--

22:38.090 --> 22:40.693
That sort of thing.
With Nudity
and sexual intercourse.

22:40.760 --> 22:44.697
Yes.
How do you do it?
Emotionally, I mean.

22:44.764 --> 22:48.000
Sex has never been
particularly important
to me.

22:48.067 --> 22:52.672
I've always found
a great book far more demanding
and satisfying, emotionally.

22:52.738 --> 22:55.041
I suppose my difficulty,
or lack of it,

22:55.108 --> 22:58.511
reflects a deep-Rooted
psychological problem,
but I've always been this way.

22:58.578 --> 23:02.582
I think what you do
is immoral.
Yes, I know you do.

23:02.648 --> 23:04.784
You ever seen one
of my pictures?
No.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.853
They're really
very funny, you know.

23:06.919 --> 23:10.356
Personally,
I can't understand why people
find them titillating.

23:10.423 --> 23:14.327
I suppose that reflects
a lacking on their part,
wouldn't you say?

23:14.393 --> 23:19.398
I'm really very highly respected
in the philippines, north africa
and the middle east.

23:19.465 --> 23:22.001
Albuquerque too.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.070
Albuquerque, new mexico?

23:24.137 --> 23:27.340
Hmm. I was voted, uh,
star of the year...

23:27.406 --> 23:31.310
at the albuquerque
erotic film festival.

23:31.377 --> 23:33.579
I didn't know
they had one.
Neither did I.

23:33.646 --> 23:37.383
Why do they call you
the count obispo?

23:37.450 --> 23:40.720
My first Producer
was from San Luis obispo
in california.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.789
The "Count" Was added
for effect.

23:42.855 --> 23:46.559
I play a mexican-Castilian
indo-European German Aristocrat.

23:46.626 --> 23:49.629
Sort of touching all bases.
But it's always
the same character.

23:49.695 --> 23:52.665
"Torn between lust
and duty."

23:52.732 --> 23:54.734
The count Manages both
quite well.

23:54.801 --> 23:58.171
I've rescued Joan of arc
from the flames,

23:58.237 --> 24:01.040
Marie Antoinette
from the guillotine,
Helen from Troy.

24:01.107 --> 24:05.645
I've stormed the bastille,
khartoum, tower of London.

24:05.711 --> 24:08.314
But the count has rescued
his last fair Maiden.

24:08.381 --> 24:11.918
He wants to retire
with his books to vermont.

24:11.984 --> 24:14.086
Not a very dramatic ending,
is it?

24:15.588 --> 24:18.825
[ sighs ]
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way, Harold,

24:18.891 --> 24:22.862
but you don't seem like
a very romantic person to me.

24:22.929 --> 24:26.365
You know, that's what
I've always thought.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.968
Let's see if you have any
upper-Gastric tenderness.

24:32.638 --> 24:36.642
This is where we knock you
into shape, bill.

24:36.709 --> 24:40.546
You know what it's gonna take
to get that beef of yours
back into shape again?

24:40.613 --> 24:43.316
What?
I'm gonna
run you ragged.

24:43.382 --> 24:45.885
Because, you see, bill,
you're the guy...

24:45.952 --> 24:48.454
that never learned
the word "Enough,"
did you?

24:48.521 --> 24:52.758
Well, uh, I do have
a hard time saying "No"
to Chocolate.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.495
Who are you trying to kid?
It's not just chocolate.

24:55.561 --> 24:59.332
It's ice cream and beer
and anything else you can
stuff into your face, True?

24:59.398 --> 25:03.436
True.
Well, now, we're
gonna pay for it.

25:03.503 --> 25:06.272
Uh, excuse me,
dr, Craig.
What is it, Armstrong?

25:06.339 --> 25:08.341
May I speak with you
for a moment?

25:08.407 --> 25:10.376
3:00 sharp, bill.

25:12.111 --> 25:15.681
Well?
I'd like to talk to you
about Dr. Andrews.

25:15.748 --> 25:19.719
Okay.
I've been assisting him
for the past few weeks.

25:19.786 --> 25:22.288
I'm aware of that.
[ sighs ]

25:22.355 --> 25:24.323
and, well--
what?

25:25.925 --> 25:30.329
I think he's inserting
pacemakers into people
who don't need them.

25:30.396 --> 25:32.899
Why the hell would you
think a thing like that?

25:32.965 --> 25:36.135
Because the conditions
of half the patients
didn't warrant it.

25:37.670 --> 25:42.141
In the last four weeks
Dr. Andrews has inserted
28 pacemakers,

25:42.208 --> 25:45.211
and I've looked at
the case histories
of 14 of those patients.

25:45.278 --> 25:49.315
Just this morning we operated
on an Alfred standar,
52 years old,

25:49.382 --> 25:53.386
with no history
of heart disease prior
to a minor infarction.

25:53.453 --> 25:56.322
I saw his e.K.G. Tracing,
Dr. Craig.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.324
He did not need
that pacemaker.

25:58.391 --> 26:00.626
You didn't think
it was necessary.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.502
How long have you
been a heart surgeon,
Armstrong?

26:09.569 --> 26:12.238
Dr. Craig,
I'm not trying to--
How long?

26:14.006 --> 26:16.742
I'm not a heart surgeon.
What are you?

26:16.809 --> 26:20.713
I'm a resident,
a first-year resident.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.749
I would think
long and hard,
young lady,

26:23.816 --> 26:27.587
before I started tossing around
such serious accusations.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.624
Now, get out of here.

26:36.762 --> 26:40.466
Ballroom dancing?
Sure. It's a lot of Fun.
Tango, samba, rumba.

26:40.533 --> 26:43.169
I'm not
a very good dancer.
I wasn't either.

26:43.236 --> 26:45.805
You start out slow.
Get down here.
One, two, three now.

26:45.872 --> 26:48.074
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

26:48.141 --> 26:50.476
<i>There you are,
you pink swine!
Beat it, Lucille!</i>

26:50.543 --> 26:53.045
What the hell's
the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?

26:53.112 --> 26:55.848
You didn't happen to get
a message from Dr. Mauri
for me, did you?

26:55.915 --> 26:57.850
Mauri?
Something about
a lecture?

26:57.917 --> 26:59.919
Oh, yeah! Mauri.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

26:59.986 --> 27:03.189
I was supposed to do a lecture
for 40 medical students
at B.U. This morning,

27:03.256 --> 27:05.258
and you forgot,
you're sorry.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.827
This is not
a laundry ticket, Victor.
This is my career!

27:07.894 --> 27:10.396
What's the big deal?
It's only a lecture.
To you it's only a lecture!

27:10.463 --> 27:12.465
To me it's an opportunity
to get in with Dr. Mauri!

27:12.532 --> 27:15.034
You think I'm gonna
be high on her list for
an e.R. Fellowship now?

27:15.101 --> 27:17.603
Then you should have
made sure you talked
to her yourself.

27:17.670 --> 27:20.673
I was counting on you!
Hey, I'm not
your errand boy, Fiscus.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.742
I'm not your
answering machine.

27:22.809 --> 27:25.077
You are thoughtless,
inconsiderate!
You are selfish!

27:25.144 --> 27:27.146
Hold on, you sniveling
little water Rat.

27:27.213 --> 27:30.216
Don't you dare talk to me
about selfish! You want to
know what selfish is?

27:30.283 --> 27:33.286
How about I cook a chicken
so I have something to eat
when I get off at 4:00 a.M.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.888
I open the refrigerator--
You didn't even leave me a wing!

27:35.955 --> 27:37.890
You are Petty, Petty!
Petty?

27:37.957 --> 27:41.594
I'll talk to you about Petty.
And you're the most thoughtless
person on the whole planet!

27:41.661 --> 27:44.964
You borrow my Sister's car
to visit one of your bimbos
in north andover.

27:45.031 --> 27:48.534
Fourteen degrees out,
I go out there, you didn't even
leave me a drop of gas.

27:48.601 --> 27:51.938
You got a gas can in the car,
a gas station three blocks away.
What is the big deal?

27:52.004 --> 27:54.941
What's the big deal?
I'm not talking about an
EMERGENCY room fellowship.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.176
But I am talking
about something
that's important to me.

27:57.243 --> 28:00.446
I'm not talking about my career,
but I'm talking about my comfort
in my home!

28:00.513 --> 28:04.884
Out of the kindness of my heart,
I take you in when I should have
thrown you out in the street!

28:04.951 --> 28:06.953
What do you do?
Where's your gratitude?

28:07.019 --> 28:09.021
You eat all my food,
you soil my sheets,

to wear my shirt...

28:11.491 --> 28:13.793
'cause you're too lazy
to pick up the laundry!

28:13.860 --> 28:16.028
You want your shirt?
You want your shirt?
Yes.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.698
Here's your shirt.
Don't you dare rip that.
Don't you rip that!

28:18.764 --> 28:21.768
"Don't you rip it"?
there it is!

it's not for lack of offers
from other institutions,

was a deep rapport

Are you sure that
Mr. Standar's arrhythmia...

34:01.607 --> 34:03.810

to warrant a pacemaker?

yes, Dr. Andrews, I did.

34:46.985 --> 34:49.255

34:49.322 --> 34:52.525
I don't feel that
many of the insertions
were indicated.

34:52.592 --> 34:55.094
Could you be a little
more specific perhaps?

34:55.161 --> 34:59.565
I studied the case histories
of Mr. Cunningham
and Mr. Timberland,

34:59.632 --> 35:03.636
neither of Whom
had ever been put
on any cardiac medication.

35:03.703 --> 35:06.239
And when I worked
on Mr. Standar's heart
this morning--

35:06.305 --> 35:08.241
His heart was not
in bad shape,

35:08.307 --> 35:11.077
even though he had suffered
a myocardial infarction
two years ago.

35:11.144 --> 35:13.312
You're wrong,
Dr. Armstrong,

35:13.379 --> 35:16.682
but what I find
even more offensive
than your arrogance...

35:16.749 --> 35:19.252
is the lack of character
and backbone you showed...

35:19.318 --> 35:23.523
by Trying to get at me
through Dr. Craig, rather
than confronting me yourself.

35:24.824 --> 35:26.826
I did what I thought
was right.

35:26.893 --> 35:29.829
What you did was slanderous,

35:29.896 --> 35:32.965
but, more importantly,
void of any thought.

35:33.032 --> 35:36.035
There are only two reasons
why a surgeon would
needlessly operate...

35:36.102 --> 35:40.640
on another human being--
because he's crazy
or he's broke.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.642
Well, I'm neither.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.878
I don't consider myself
a vindictive person,
Dr. Armstrong,

35:45.945 --> 35:48.915
but if I were,
you'd be spending the rest
of your residency...

of Looking up his records.

Please, Dr. Craig.

36:54.447 --> 36:58.484
Now, I know I cannot prove
that what Dr. Andrews
is doing is illegal,

36:58.551 --> 37:01.420
but there are
certain discrepancies,
irregularities.

37:01.487 --> 37:03.422
Like what?

37:03.489 --> 37:08.094
There have been markups
on medicare patients Who've
undergone the Procedure.

37:08.161 --> 37:11.330
Dr. Armstrong,
the pacemaker insertion...

37:11.397 --> 37:14.534
costs between
$2,000 and $5,000.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.370
Now, the difference
in the cost
has nothing to do...

37:17.437 --> 37:20.773
with the patient's income,
but rather the complexity
of the surgery.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.776
Yes, I realize that
I'm dealing in gray areas.

37:23.843 --> 37:26.312
Next irregularity.

37:26.379 --> 37:30.850
Several inappropriate
disease entities have been used
to justify insertions.

37:30.917 --> 37:32.852
What entities?

37:32.919 --> 37:37.557
Several patients with
second-Degree heart block
have been given insertions.

37:37.623 --> 37:41.594
I'm aware of the argument
that insertions aren't
always effective...

37:41.661 --> 37:44.063
with All second-Degree
heart blocks,

37:44.130 --> 37:47.467
but at this point,
the evidence
is inconclusive.

37:47.533 --> 37:49.702
Now, is there
anything else?

37:49.769 --> 37:52.371
All of the pacemakers
that Dr. Andrews Has used...

37:52.438 --> 37:54.740
are from the same company,
crestline.

37:54.807 --> 37:57.610
Crestline
makes an excellent,
high-Quality product.

37:57.677 --> 37:59.612
There's nothing unusual
with that.

37:59.679 --> 38:01.981
Not unless Dr. Andrews
is getting kickbacks.

38:02.048 --> 38:05.551
<i>I have seen these
manufacturers and their
high-Pressure salesmen...</i>

38:05.618 --> 38:09.856

Dr. Andrews...

38:16.529 --> 38:19.799
is a very successful
and wealthy surgeon.

38:19.866 --> 38:22.635
Now, Why would he do
a thing like that?
I don't know.

38:22.702 --> 38:26.739
You don't know?
Well, let me tell you
something, Dr. Armstrong.

38:26.806 --> 38:29.342
Your evidence
doesn't exist.

38:29.408 --> 38:33.045
Now, you've succeeded
in alienating
a very powerful...

38:33.112 --> 38:35.681
and respected member
of this hospital!

38:35.748 --> 38:39.919
And now you've got
your own head
on the block.

38:39.986 --> 38:42.789
Now, you want my advice,
you'll apologize
to Dr. Andrews...

38:42.855 --> 38:46.459
and do your best
to make peace with the man.

38:47.660 --> 38:50.496
Now, if you don't mind,
I've got work to do.

Dr. Craig,
with all due respect,

and Dr. Andrews is

39:09.749 --> 39:11.717

39:15.688 --> 39:19.859

I saw a house
in Newton, right next
to Boston college.

41:46.539 --> 41:48.608
The noise was terrible.

41:48.674 --> 41:52.178
Then I saw
Larry Andrews's house again,
and it's a dream.

350.

41:54.247 --> 41:56.949

is enormous!

and he said it's supposed
to look like a pacemaker.

42:30.750 --> 42:33.085

Oh, that's
kind of a sore spot
with me today, mark.

44:19.725 --> 44:23.963

I was very angry
with her myself.

very irritating.

44:35.441 --> 44:38.211

Mm-Hmm.

44:41.214 --> 44:45.685

to her inexperience

wanted to know and more.
