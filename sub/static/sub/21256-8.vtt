WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:03.401
If you still think about Gabe,

00:03.436 --> 00:05.136
he still thinks about you.

00:05.171 --> 00:06.404
How do you know that?

00:06.439 --> 00:09.040
He said that you were the only
woman that he's ever loved.

00:09.075 --> 00:11.409
I have something for you.

00:11.444 --> 00:15.079
I wanted to give it to
you as a promise ring.

00:15.115 --> 00:16.414
He gave her a ring.

00:16.449 --> 00:18.282
A ring? An engagement ring?

00:18.318 --> 00:20.284
We just got an invite
from Eminent Power.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.120
They want us to be, like,
ambassadors for them.

00:22.155 --> 00:24.055
We already have plenty of girl gamers.

00:24.090 --> 00:25.423
We're just looking for some gay-mers...

00:25.458 --> 00:27.458
you know, G-A-Y-mers.

00:27.494 --> 00:30.495
You should, uh, throw your
dad's engagement party here.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.063
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:32.098 --> 00:35.066
If our university will
not block Shiloh McCullen

00:35.101 --> 00:37.135
from spewing her hateful
speech, then we will.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.337
Are you saying there's a
chance we could get arrested?

00:39.372 --> 00:41.139
Getting arrested is the goal.

00:44.437 --> 00:46.404
- Under the Sea?
- Masquerade?

00:46.439 --> 00:47.605
- Ooh.
- Mardi Gras?

00:47.640 --> 00:50.208
Okay, you all have a very
low opinions of prom committee

00:50.243 --> 00:51.342
if you think we're that unoriginal.

00:51.377 --> 00:52.577
Take it easy.

00:52.612 --> 00:54.378
I remember the theme of my prom.

00:54.414 --> 00:56.414
It was "Right Here, Right Now."

00:59.352 --> 01:00.551
The Jesus Jones's song.

01:00.587 --> 01:02.220
Nobody?

01:02.255 --> 01:03.521
Wow, I'm old.

01:03.556 --> 01:05.355
Anyway, we moved prom up this year,

01:05.391 --> 01:07.191
so we don't have to compete for venues,

01:07.227 --> 01:08.359
but now we're way behind.

01:08.394 --> 01:11.095
So I was hoping my lovely
family could pitch in.

01:11.131 --> 01:12.163
Anyone?

01:12.198 --> 01:13.331
Can I even go to prom?

01:13.366 --> 01:15.266
I'm probably not gonna go.

01:15.301 --> 01:16.534
Aaron's in college.

01:16.569 --> 01:18.402
- Yeah, same here.
- Hey, I'm home!

01:18.438 --> 01:21.139
Wait, you have to go. You're seniors.

01:21.174 --> 01:23.341
This could be ABCC's last prom ever.

01:23.376 --> 01:25.409
That is a good theme.

01:25.445 --> 01:27.178
"The Last Dance."

01:27.213 --> 01:29.180
Well, I wouldn't count on that.

01:29.215 --> 01:31.249
Because Monte and I just
met with a board member

01:31.284 --> 01:33.151
and it took some convincing, but...

01:33.186 --> 01:35.453
she offered to give her
vote to the students.

01:35.488 --> 01:37.522
- Wow!
- That's amazing!

01:37.557 --> 01:40.291
The students are 1,000 percent
gonna vote against going private.

01:40.326 --> 01:43.494
Hopefully, we are one vote
closer to saving Anchor Beach.

01:43.530 --> 01:46.297
Uh, so now that you both are here,
I know this is kind of last minute,

01:46.332 --> 01:47.532
but Mike and Ana's engagement party

01:47.567 --> 01:49.267
has to be this weekend.

01:50.270 --> 01:52.203
Uh, uh, that's awfully fast.

01:52.238 --> 01:54.338
- Well, the wedding's in a month.
- What's the rush?

01:54.374 --> 01:57.241
I guess AJ's turning 18 and
he's moving into Ana's apartment,

01:57.277 --> 01:59.343
so Ana's moving in with Dad,

01:59.379 --> 02:01.312
and the Gutierrezes would
prefer they aren't, like,

02:01.347 --> 02:03.147
living in sin.

02:03.183 --> 02:05.383
And this is the only weekend
that works for everyone.

02:05.418 --> 02:08.419
So, Mom, could you help
me run some errands?

02:08.454 --> 02:10.321
Oh, no, that is your deal, Brandon.

02:10.356 --> 02:13.224
Yeah, we'll help on the
day, but you're the best man.

02:13.259 --> 02:15.193
Uh, can Emma come?

02:15.228 --> 02:17.428
Come on, it's been a week.
So I can see her, right?

02:17.463 --> 02:19.096
Honey, it's a family party,

02:19.132 --> 02:20.498
so no girlfriends or boyfriends.

02:20.533 --> 02:23.234
Uh, Emma's not just my girlfiend.

02:23.269 --> 02:25.136
Right. She's your fiancée.

02:25.171 --> 02:26.404
- Mariana.
- I'm done.

02:26.439 --> 02:28.372
Hey, could you please ask to be excused?

02:28.408 --> 02:30.107
Yeah. Can I be excused?

02:31.477 --> 02:33.244
- Yes, you may.
- Thanks.

02:37.483 --> 02:39.483
Is he ever gonna be normal again?

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074

03:25.465 --> 03:28.199
Mmm. Thanks for the food.

03:28.234 --> 03:30.101
Yeah, it would have gone bad anyway.

03:31.471 --> 03:35.439
So, we're having a party on
Saturday for Mike and Ana.

03:35.475 --> 03:37.308
I know. Ana invited me.

03:37.343 --> 03:39.277
Yeah. Well, you gonna go?

03:39.312 --> 03:41.112
I don't think Mike would want me there.

03:41.147 --> 03:42.246
I know her parents won't.

03:42.282 --> 03:43.481
But they wrote you the letter

03:43.516 --> 03:45.449
to get you off the sex offender list.

03:45.485 --> 03:47.251
It will get awkward, trust me.

03:47.287 --> 03:49.120
Why? Because you still love her?

03:50.523 --> 03:52.189
- I never said that.
- Yeah, you did.

03:52.225 --> 03:54.392
You said that she's the only
woman that you've ever loved.

03:55.528 --> 03:58.162
Okay, but she's marrying Mike, so...

03:58.197 --> 04:00.298
Because she doesn't know
how you feel about her.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.466
- Maybe, I...
- Well, neither do I.

04:02.502 --> 04:04.435
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't
make a difference, anyway.

04:04.470 --> 04:06.203
They're getting married in a month.

04:07.106 --> 04:08.172
So, just...

04:08.207 --> 04:10.508
if you figure it out...

04:11.444 --> 04:13.144
don't wait until it's too late.

04:20.119 --> 04:22.353
How long are we gonna let
Jesus think that he's engaged?

04:23.556 --> 04:26.123
I mean, I say we go in there right now

04:26.159 --> 04:27.491
and tell him that he's
not getting married,

04:27.527 --> 04:29.527
and he is going back to
school or I will arrest him.

04:29.622 --> 04:32.256
That's not gonna work,
trust me. I've seen it.

04:32.291 --> 04:35.192
The more we demand, the
more defiant he gets.

04:35.228 --> 04:37.528
Besides, does it matter
what the motivation is

04:37.563 --> 04:39.397
if it gets him back to school?

04:39.432 --> 04:42.333
Well, what does Emma
think about all this?

04:42.368 --> 04:45.236
Well, you said yourself she's
got a good head on her shoulders.

04:45.271 --> 04:47.338
And for all we know, with Jesus's TBI,

04:47.373 --> 04:49.407
this whole thing could be in his head.

04:49.442 --> 04:51.509
I seriously doubt she
agreed to marry him.

04:51.544 --> 04:53.477
Well, I think that we should find out.

04:59.652 --> 05:01.485
Save Anchor Beach.

05:01.591 --> 05:03.491
Protect our public charter.

05:03.526 --> 05:05.426
Anchor Beach Academy is fascist.

05:05.461 --> 05:08.429
So, have you talked to your moms?

05:08.464 --> 05:09.663
Um, yeah.

05:09.699 --> 05:12.199
They're letting me play as
long as my grades don't slip

05:12.235 --> 05:13.634
and I put some of the
money away for college.

05:13.669 --> 05:15.569
Well, then, we're good to go.

05:15.605 --> 05:17.404
Have you heard back from Eminent Power?

05:18.274 --> 05:19.373
When do we start?

05:19.408 --> 05:21.609
Um, no, no. I haven't yet.

05:21.644 --> 05:23.410
Keep Anchor Beach free.

05:23.446 --> 05:25.346
Do you think Noah's gonna be okay

05:25.381 --> 05:27.615
with you playing video games every day?

05:27.650 --> 05:29.583
Guys, stay focused.

05:29.652 --> 05:32.286
Hey! Don't be fooled by empty promises.

05:32.321 --> 05:33.621
Can we count on your vote?

05:33.656 --> 05:35.689
I don't know. Have you seen the model?

05:37.727 --> 05:39.493
What model?

05:41.397 --> 05:43.264
- Holy...
- Crap.

05:43.299 --> 05:44.565
- So legit.
- Right?

05:44.600 --> 05:46.500
Seriously?

05:48.337 --> 05:50.271
You wanted to see me?

05:50.306 --> 05:51.605
Oh, Emma, hi.

05:53.543 --> 05:55.242
How are you?

05:55.278 --> 05:57.478
Fine. Is... everything okay?

06:00.449 --> 06:02.249
Yes, everything is fine.

06:02.285 --> 06:03.584
Um...

06:03.619 --> 06:05.486
We just wanted to let you know

06:05.521 --> 06:07.388
why you haven't been
allowed at the house.

06:07.423 --> 06:10.524
I... I get it. I told him he
shouldn't have gone to that party.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.327
Well, we didn't want you to think
it had anything to do with you.

06:13.362 --> 06:16.330
And we are so grateful for how
supportive you've been of Jesus

06:16.365 --> 06:17.464
and his recovery.

06:17.500 --> 06:20.301
And thank you for convincing
him to come back to school.

06:20.336 --> 06:21.602
Honestly...

06:21.637 --> 06:23.370
we don't know what he'd do without you.

06:25.474 --> 06:27.508
I... I'm happy to help.

06:27.543 --> 06:28.676
Whatever it takes.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.281
We're very happy you've
chosen to apply to UCSD.

06:34.317 --> 06:36.517
And your essay really set you apart.

06:36.552 --> 06:39.253
I had no idea how
vulnerable foster youth are

06:39.288 --> 06:40.487
when they age out of the system.

06:40.523 --> 06:42.423
Most people don't.

06:42.458 --> 06:45.359
Well, I see you're
interested in the art school,

06:45.394 --> 06:46.660
but can I be perfectly frank?

06:48.331 --> 06:49.730
Sure.

06:49.765 --> 06:52.399
I think you'd have a better chance
of getting into the university,

06:52.435 --> 06:54.468
if you chose a less competitive major.

06:54.503 --> 06:56.270
I mean, based on your background,

06:56.305 --> 06:58.539
and the fact that your
portfolio isn't finished,

06:58.574 --> 07:02.176
I think you'd have better
luck if you applied for, say,

07:02.211 --> 07:03.577
Social Work, or Psychology.

07:05.214 --> 07:06.547
Just... give it some thought.

07:13.968 --> 07:15.701
Callie? Callie!

07:17.805 --> 07:19.838
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:21.776 --> 07:23.742
- Are you...
- Interviewing? Yeah.

07:23.778 --> 07:24.843
For the art school.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.915
Wait. You're not mad?

07:29.951 --> 07:31.951
Why would I be mad?

07:31.986 --> 07:35.020
I've got to live-stream two
hours a day, six days a week.

07:35.056 --> 07:36.956
Yeah, for money.

07:36.991 --> 07:39.625
Okay, it's a totally different thing.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.826
This is a job.

07:42.830 --> 07:43.896
Taylor must be psyched.

07:44.999 --> 07:46.966
Now she gets you every day.

07:47.001 --> 07:48.667
Yeah.

07:48.703 --> 07:50.002
They only wanted me.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.671
Oh! Damn.

07:52.707 --> 07:53.706
I...

07:54.008 --> 07:55.908
How did she take that?

07:55.943 --> 07:58.611
She doesn't know.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.012
I don't know how to tell her.

08:00.982 --> 08:02.648
Okay. Um...

08:03.851 --> 08:05.784
Look, all you gotta do

08:05.820 --> 08:08.621
is tell her that you
really want to do it

08:08.656 --> 08:10.756
and that it's a great opportunity,

08:10.791 --> 08:12.691
but you won't do it if
she doesn't want you to.

08:13.928 --> 08:15.661
What if she doesn't want me to?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.696
Look, she'll be glad that you offered,

08:17.732 --> 08:19.732
but she'll feel too guilty and
she'll tell you to go ahead.

08:20.835 --> 08:21.867
Trust me.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.969
Look, it works on my mom every time.

08:26.907 --> 08:30.943
I had no idea you were doing
anything other than comic book stuff.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.945
Why would you?

08:32.980 --> 08:35.714
But, yeah, I decided I wanted
to try some different things,

08:35.750 --> 08:37.916
show the schools a wider range.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.852
It's all really amazing.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.020
Thank you.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.855
So, what major are you applying for?

08:44.925 --> 08:46.025
Um...

08:46.060 --> 08:47.893
Social Work, I think.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.928
Cool. You'd be great at that.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.730
AJ Hensdale?

08:53.634 --> 08:55.034
Good luck.

08:55.069 --> 08:56.602
Thank you.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.703
Oh. I'll see you at the party?

08:57.738 --> 08:58.771
Um...

08:58.806 --> 09:00.873
- Mike and Ana's?
- Right.

09:00.908 --> 09:01.874
Yeah.

09:12.787 --> 09:15.654
Chips, salsa, pizza, cookies.

09:15.690 --> 09:18.023
Is this a birthday party
for a five-year-old?

09:18.059 --> 09:19.725
All you need is a clown.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.695
That's what I'm saying. I mean,
I don't know how to throw a party.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.830
- Yeah.
- And I want it to be, you know, nice.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.865
- All right, let me help you.
- Thank you.

09:29.804 --> 09:30.936
_

09:34.041 --> 09:35.908
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.610
It's just, Mariana's part of
the prom planning committee,

09:38.646 --> 09:41.613
and... I mean, I'm sure
you don't want to go.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.816
Well, of course I want to go.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.818
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.953
Homeschooled. Never had a prom.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.688
But, I mean, if we go,
we have to do it right.

09:49.724 --> 09:52.958
I want the whole dress
and corsage, and...

09:52.993 --> 09:54.893
You know, you can ask
me when you're ready.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.996
Well, I... thought I just did.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.765
Yeah. Whenever you're ready.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.736
Uh, okay. Well, Grace,
would you want to go

10:03.804 --> 10:04.937
- to prom...
- Hey, hey, hey.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.906
Take your time. Whenever you're ready.

10:09.110 --> 10:10.909
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.883
Maybe she's right. Maybe you
should look into social work.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.719
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

10:20.755 --> 10:22.621
That's not what I mean

10:23.858 --> 10:26.859
Look, the point is to just
get into the university,

10:26.894 --> 10:29.027
and then you could
always transfer into art.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.963
Or into the law program I'm in.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.998
I mean, you'd be amazing.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.604
Um, speaking of,

10:38.639 --> 10:41.707
I got that internship I told you about.

10:42.977 --> 10:44.843
The one in New York?

10:46.013 --> 10:47.746
That's great!

10:47.782 --> 10:49.648
It's for the whole summer.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.016
Yeah, but it's a great opportunity.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.887
I'll be here when you get back.

11:02.029 --> 11:05.731
I didn't mean to say
you're not super talented.

11:06.901 --> 11:08.934
But you're also super passionate

11:08.969 --> 11:10.769
about transforming
the foster care system,

11:10.805 --> 11:12.771
and social justice.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.543
I'm all for art, but...

11:17.578 --> 11:20.779
is that the best way for
you to change the world?

11:20.815 --> 11:23.816
Why do I have to change the
world? Why can't I just be me?

11:24.819 --> 11:26.819
Well, from what I've seen,

11:26.854 --> 11:28.020
changing the world is you.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.967
I guess the protest is on.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.970
I, uh, won't tell you to be careful.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.772
Well, I appreciate that.

11:46.807 --> 11:47.873
- Hm.
- Hm.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.014
I'm so pissed off. I mean, you
should see this stupid model.

11:56.050 --> 11:58.650
It's a total fantasy. I can't
believe people are dumb enough

11:58.686 --> 12:00.519
to actually fall for it.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.721
- You all right?
- Yeah, sorry.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.523
Just a rough few days.

12:04.959 --> 12:06.625
What's going on?

12:07.761 --> 12:08.961
It's just my dad.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.630
He's trying to update our family plan.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.632
Like for cell phones?

12:15.603 --> 12:18.537
Like if, uh, any of us get deported.

12:20.007 --> 12:20.939
Oh.

12:20.975 --> 12:24.643
You know, we've had
this plan for years now.

12:24.678 --> 12:25.811
But...

12:25.846 --> 12:27.779
with the current political situation,

12:27.815 --> 12:30.782
he's putting everything in my name.

12:31.986 --> 12:34.753
And I'm gonna be Poppy's
legal guardian now,

12:34.788 --> 12:36.722
if, you know, if
anything happens to them.

12:37.725 --> 12:39.725
And they already told us,

12:39.760 --> 12:40.959
no matter what,

12:40.995 --> 12:43.028
they want us to stay here without them.

12:44.999 --> 12:46.031
That's awful.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.935
It's so messed up

12:49.970 --> 12:52.004
that they're tearing
families apart like this.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.941
Plotting to overthrow the world, are we?

12:55.976 --> 12:57.776
If that's what it takes.

13:09.757 --> 13:12.691
So, Emma is not wearing the ring.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.660
I called her into my office today

13:14.695 --> 13:16.695
just to check in, and, you know,

13:16.730 --> 13:18.664
thank her for supporting Jesus.

13:18.699 --> 13:20.999
Well, did you happen to
ask if they were engaged?

13:21.035 --> 13:22.768
I didn't want to embarrass her.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.569
But she seemed perfectly fine,

13:24.605 --> 13:27.673
and everything between her
and Jesus seems status quo.

13:27.708 --> 13:29.875
I really just think this
engagement thing is all in his head.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.677
All right, good.

13:31.712 --> 13:34.713
Oh, also, I invited her to
Mike and Ana's party tomorrow.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.916
- Oh?
- If she's the one keeping Jesus on track,

13:37.952 --> 13:40.652
I really don't think keeping them
apart is the best idea, do you?

13:41.055 --> 13:42.788
I guess not.

13:52.700 --> 13:53.899
All right!

13:53.934 --> 13:55.834
Put me to work, boss.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.736
Where shall I set up the bar?

13:57.771 --> 13:59.671
Uh, well there is no bar.

13:59.707 --> 14:00.939
What?

14:00.975 --> 14:03.742
Well, for one, Dad and
Ana are in recovery.

14:03.777 --> 14:06.945
Okay, but your father has never
minded if other people around him...

14:06.981 --> 14:09.648
And two, I can't buy alcohol.

14:09.683 --> 14:10.901
And I asked for your help,

14:10.902 --> 14:13.618
but you didn't want to
run any errands, so...

14:13.654 --> 14:16.688
you can help me roll
these into these napkins.

14:16.724 --> 14:18.690
- Yeah, I'll grab the ribbon.
- Thank you.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.793
- Sure.
- Love you.

14:21.829 --> 14:22.861
Hey!

14:22.896 --> 14:25.731
So, did you ask Grace to prom yet?

14:25.766 --> 14:28.834
Well, I thought I did, but
then she told me to take my time

14:28.869 --> 14:30.569
and ask her when I'm ready.

14:31.772 --> 14:33.939
- What does that mean?
- She wants a promposal.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.842
An over-the-top invite.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.643
- A grand gesture.
- Oh.

14:38.679 --> 14:40.779
Like a flash mob, or...

14:40.814 --> 14:42.914
Like, in the vein of a flash mob,

14:42.950 --> 14:45.584
but definitely not a flash mob.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.552
I'm so glad I'm not in high school.

14:50.024 --> 14:51.890
Wow!

14:51.925 --> 14:53.759
Kids did a great job setting up.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.695
Where's the, uh... where's the bar?

14:57.598 --> 14:59.064
There is no bar.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.500
It's a good thing you always tell
us we don't need alcohol to have fun.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.709
Come in.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.783
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.719
You look amazing.

15:22.556 --> 15:24.923
Oh. You're not wearing the ring?

15:24.958 --> 15:26.792
Oh, yeah. I was...

15:26.827 --> 15:28.660
worried about your moms seeing it.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.997
Don't be. They know
we're getting married.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.999
And they're totally cool with it, too.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.700
Really?

15:35.736 --> 15:36.701
Yeah.

15:49.783 --> 15:50.916
Come on.

15:57.845 --> 15:59.511
Oh, AJ, that's wonderful.

15:59.546 --> 16:01.380
- Oh, God.
- Wow!

16:01.415 --> 16:02.848
Very nice job, AJ.

16:03.851 --> 16:05.684
Thanks, you guys, for
doing this. Really.

16:05.719 --> 16:07.486
No, we didn't do anything, truly.

16:07.521 --> 16:08.720
Yeah, it was all Brandon and AJ.

16:08.756 --> 16:10.656
Better go say hi to my future in-laws.

16:10.691 --> 16:11.790
Yes, you should.

16:13.694 --> 16:15.427
- Hey, Elena.
- Hi.

16:15.462 --> 16:17.629
- Hey, is that, uh...
- Yes.

16:17.665 --> 16:18.830
What's he doing here?

16:18.866 --> 16:20.766
Oh, good. Gabe decided to come.

16:20.801 --> 16:22.567
Stef and Lena are letting him live here

16:22.603 --> 16:24.503
while he helps Jesus
with his school project.

16:24.538 --> 16:26.872
Please be nice. You, too.

16:26.907 --> 16:28.540
- I am nice.
- Mm-hmm.

16:28.575 --> 16:30.409
- Victor.
- Come on!

16:30.444 --> 16:32.678
- You're family now.
- Okay.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.616
Sorry! Official
photographer of the night.

16:37.651 --> 16:39.751
Get together.

16:39.787 --> 16:42.754
- It's good to see you.
- Welcome to the family. Congratulations.

16:45.626 --> 16:46.658
Hey!

16:47.728 --> 16:49.695
- Look at this guy.
- So handsome!

16:49.730 --> 16:51.797
Oh, hey Brandon. Where's the bar?

16:51.832 --> 16:53.832
There is no bar. Jeez.

16:53.867 --> 16:56.735
But there's soda and water
in the cooler on the patio.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.441
Look at you, beautiful.

17:03.577 --> 17:05.676
Come take a picture. Picture.

17:05.713 --> 17:07.479
Grandma's got to be in front.

17:20.761 --> 17:23.662
Emma. Hi, honey.

17:23.696 --> 17:26.531
- How are you?
- Good.

17:26.567 --> 17:27.733
Good to see you. Thanks for coming.

17:30.604 --> 17:32.437
Oh!

17:32.473 --> 17:34.506
The... That's, uh...

17:34.541 --> 17:36.575
the ring that Jesus gave you?

17:36.610 --> 17:37.876
- Yeah.
- Oh.

17:37.911 --> 17:40.412
That's, uh... Wow. That's very pretty.

17:40.447 --> 17:41.880
Thanks.

17:41.915 --> 17:44.750
So, AJ, how are your
college applications going?

17:44.785 --> 17:46.685
Good, good. I'm running
out of humble brags...

17:46.720 --> 17:49.588
- It's a nice party.
- Thank you so much.

17:49.623 --> 17:51.923
Brandon and AJ, you
know, they did it all.

17:51.959 --> 17:54.893
- Try some of the hors d'oeuvres.
- Ooh, I think I will.

17:54.928 --> 17:57.596
- Okay.
- Where are you applying?

17:57.631 --> 17:59.398
Mostly UCs.

17:59.433 --> 18:01.366
Hopefully I'll get into UCSD.

18:01.402 --> 18:03.468
I just had my interview
for the art school today.

18:03.504 --> 18:06.671
Oh, you did? You know, Callie is
applying to the art school as well.

18:06.707 --> 18:10.542
She's auditing an art class there
this semester. Did you tell him?

18:11.678 --> 18:13.412
What is wrong with you?

18:14.815 --> 18:17.616
Ah. Oh... Oh, sorry, honey.

18:17.651 --> 18:20.419
I just, I have, uh... I think
I have something in my eye.

18:20.454 --> 18:21.720
- It really...
- Okay.

18:21.755 --> 18:22.821
I'm so sorry.

18:25.492 --> 18:27.392
Why didn't you tell me?

18:30.564 --> 18:32.864
Like, your work is so good.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.467
I mean, there's no way I'm gonna get in,

18:35.502 --> 18:37.436
so, what's the point
of even saying anything?

18:37.471 --> 18:39.438
Why would you assume that?

18:39.473 --> 18:41.440
You got asked to audit
a class. That's huge.

18:41.475 --> 18:42.460
Yeah, just because the art teacher

18:42.461 --> 18:45.410
saw my senior project at Anchor Beach.

18:45.446 --> 18:47.512
I only have three
pieces in my portfolio.

18:47.548 --> 18:50.749
That's not enough, and I don't
even know if they're any good.

18:51.885 --> 18:53.718
Well, can I see them?

18:53.754 --> 18:55.854
Just to make sure they're
as bad as you think they are?

18:58.625 --> 19:00.692
- She's wearing it.
- What?

19:00.727 --> 19:03.395
The ring. The engagement...

19:03.430 --> 19:05.831
It's... it's out of Jesus's head

19:05.866 --> 19:08.700
onto her finger.

19:08.735 --> 19:10.802
Maybe she doesn't think it
means what Jesus thinks it means.

19:12.573 --> 19:13.672
What are you... What are you doing?

19:13.707 --> 19:15.674
There's not enough to
share and we need this.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.509
This is a new low.

19:19.746 --> 19:21.780
I think that we need
to ask her, directly,

19:21.815 --> 19:23.482
are they engaged?

19:23.517 --> 19:24.783
Right now? In the middle of a party?

19:24.818 --> 19:27.385
No, not now, but soon. Very, very soon.

19:35.762 --> 19:38.396
- Hey!
- Hey.

19:38.432 --> 19:39.698
Did you talk to Ana yet?

19:39.733 --> 19:41.500
What? No.

19:41.535 --> 19:43.568
No, and I'm not going to, Jesus.

19:43.604 --> 19:45.437
This is her engagement party.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.573
Maybe that's why she invited you.

19:48.609 --> 19:50.575
So that you'd realize
that this is happening

19:50.611 --> 19:53.445
and you would say something.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.881
Come on. What is the worst
that could happen? She says no?

19:58.719 --> 20:00.852
- Say something.
- Oh.

20:00.888 --> 20:03.655
- Hey! I'm glad you came.
- Hey.

20:03.690 --> 20:06.424
Yeah, I'm not so sure
your folks feel that way.

20:06.460 --> 20:08.426
Oh, they're fine, I promise.

20:08.462 --> 20:10.529
I am gonna go grab some food.

20:10.564 --> 20:11.596
Bye-bye.

20:14.701 --> 20:15.867
So...

20:15.903 --> 20:18.470
where's, uh, where's Isabella?

20:18.505 --> 20:20.639
We finally got her to
sleep. Can you believe it?

20:22.809 --> 20:24.609
She likes you.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.513
What's there not to like.

20:32.553 --> 20:35.620
All right, let's take
a birth family photo.

20:35.656 --> 20:36.788
Come on.

20:38.492 --> 20:39.791
Come on.

20:39.826 --> 20:41.726
Okay, everyone get close.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.595
Ready?

20:43.630 --> 20:44.863
They are a beautiful family.

20:44.898 --> 20:47.666
Three, two, one...

20:48.835 --> 20:49.935
Perfect!

20:49.970 --> 20:51.736
Aw, it's so cute.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.672
You ever think maybe we made a mistake,

20:53.707 --> 20:55.507
pushing Gabe out of her life?

21:10.052 --> 21:11.785
These are great.

21:15.825 --> 21:17.124
I love this one.

21:17.159 --> 21:18.959
Yeah, you're the only one.

21:18.995 --> 21:21.729
You should have heard the
critique my class gave me.

21:21.764 --> 21:23.097
Oh, the hell with them.

21:23.132 --> 21:26.166
No, I mean, maybe I should
apply to another program,

21:26.202 --> 21:28.936
do something that can make a difference.

21:28.971 --> 21:30.971
- You don't think art can make a difference?
- You know what I mean.

21:31.007 --> 21:32.172
No, I don't.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.008
Art raises awareness.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.877
It changes opinions and politics.

21:36.913 --> 21:39.146
It overcomes cultural divisions.

21:39.181 --> 21:41.782
It can move people to move mountains.

21:41.817 --> 21:43.918
I hope you said that in
your interview yesterday.

21:43.953 --> 21:45.953
I'm serious, Callie.

21:45.988 --> 21:48.022
But yes, I did.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.157
There's a lot of ways
you can make a difference.

21:50.192 --> 21:51.992
Maybe there's an easier way for me.

21:52.028 --> 21:53.127
Don't do that.

21:53.162 --> 21:55.763
Don't give up on what you really want

21:55.798 --> 21:57.131
just to do what's easier.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.999
Do what makes you happy.

22:00.136 --> 22:02.036
What inspires you?

22:07.009 --> 22:09.910
Shiloh McCullen. She is the devil.

22:09.946 --> 22:12.079
She's speaking at the
university tomorrow.

22:12.114 --> 22:14.048
We're gonna block her.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.049
Oh, yeah?

22:16.085 --> 22:17.751
You want some backup?

22:19.922 --> 22:21.722
Okay, everybody.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.191
Hi, everyone. Can I get
everyone's attention, please?

22:24.226 --> 22:29.163
Okay, so, as the best man, it is
my job to give the first toast.

22:29.198 --> 22:32.032
I'm sorry there isn't any champagne,

22:32.068 --> 22:35.035
but there is plenty of
ginger ale, so go nuts.

22:35.071 --> 22:37.738
Anyway, um...

22:37.773 --> 22:42.109
instead of a toast, I decided
to write this for you, Dad.

All right, who's next?

23:54.904 --> 23:56.604
Ooh! Us, us.

24:02.678 --> 24:04.612
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:04.647 --> 24:07.815
By the way, that was
beautiful, Grace and Brandon.

24:07.850 --> 24:10.985
Anna, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

24:11.020 --> 24:14.522
I'm so happy that you found
Mike. He's an amazing guy.

24:14.557 --> 24:15.656
- Told you.
- And...

24:15.691 --> 24:17.892
you guys are totally soul mates, so...

24:17.927 --> 24:19.627
I'm so happy for you.

24:19.662 --> 24:21.962
Hear! Hear!

24:21.998 --> 24:24.832
Uh, yeah.

24:24.867 --> 24:26.667
So, I, um...

24:27.637 --> 24:29.970
Well, I guess I never really...

24:30.006 --> 24:33.774
thought that I'd be at an
engagement party for my birth mom.

24:33.809 --> 24:36.977
I never really thought that
we'd have a relationship...

24:37.013 --> 24:38.846
with you.

24:38.881 --> 24:40.748
Or you, Gabe.

24:42.952 --> 24:44.985
But, um...

24:45.021 --> 24:47.688
one thing that I know...

24:48.925 --> 24:50.758
is that it's never too late.

24:51.994 --> 24:53.961
Even if you think it is.

24:55.731 --> 24:57.665
So, yeah, that's pretty
much what I wanted to say.

25:01.971 --> 25:04.505
- All right, Jesus!
- Woo!

25:08.911 --> 25:11.679
- What the hell was that toast?
- What do you mean?

25:11.714 --> 25:13.747
This is my dad's engagement party!

25:13.783 --> 25:16.884
There is so much to say, mija.

25:16.919 --> 25:18.886
We are so proud of you.

25:18.921 --> 25:22.656
- It takes such strength and faith...
- Okay. Look, Brandon.

25:22.692 --> 25:24.558
If Gabe and Ana

25:24.594 --> 25:25.893
still have feelings for each other...

25:25.928 --> 25:27.695
It's none of your business!

25:27.730 --> 25:30.931
Do you really want your dad to
marry Ana if she still loves Gabe?

25:30.967 --> 25:33.867
Good on the grill!

25:33.903 --> 25:35.903
You're unbelievable.

25:35.938 --> 25:37.738
Just stay out of it, okay?

25:37.773 --> 25:39.974
- To Mike and Ana!
- Mike and Ana!

25:46.682 --> 25:47.815
Hey.

25:49.018 --> 25:51.552
What are you doing in here all alone?

25:51.587 --> 25:52.987
Sorry, I was just taking a break.

25:55.758 --> 25:57.558
Honey, are you all right?

26:08.671 --> 26:11.538
I really want Jesus to get better

26:11.574 --> 26:13.507
and go back to school,

26:13.542 --> 26:15.542
but I'm not ready to be engaged.

26:26.339 --> 26:27.472
Gabe.

26:29.142 --> 26:30.441
Got a minute?

26:30.477 --> 26:32.243
Mr. and Mrs. Gutierrez.

26:34.180 --> 26:36.347
Gabe, this is, um,

26:36.383 --> 26:38.216
hard for us to say.

26:40.320 --> 26:42.086
We're sorry.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.354
For what we did to you.

26:43.390 --> 26:46.124
We thought we were doing
the best for our daughter.

26:46.159 --> 26:48.059
And...

26:48.094 --> 26:49.460
who knows what might have been

26:49.496 --> 26:52.130
if we had handled things differently.

26:53.300 --> 26:54.332
Oh.

26:56.169 --> 26:57.502
Thank you.

26:57.537 --> 27:00.004
Way to make your old man cry, huh?

27:00.040 --> 27:02.106
Well, that was what I was going for.

27:02.142 --> 27:03.341
This is a great party, B.

27:03.376 --> 27:05.076
Thank you.

27:07.247 --> 27:08.413
Everything okay?

27:09.516 --> 27:12.383
Brandon, thank you
so much for the party.

27:12.419 --> 27:14.218
Yeah. Sure.

27:14.254 --> 27:16.254
Um, Dave's leaving, so if
you want to say goodbye.

27:16.289 --> 27:17.221
Oh, okay.

27:20.226 --> 27:22.226
Um, excuse me.

27:30.236 --> 27:31.436
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:33.273 --> 27:36.307
Jesus's recovery is
not your responsibility.

27:36.343 --> 27:38.109
It's his.

27:38.144 --> 27:39.310
And it's mine and it's Stef's.

27:39.346 --> 27:41.512
And I'm so sorry that
I didn't think about

27:41.548 --> 27:44.248
the burden I was putting on you.

27:44.284 --> 27:47.352
So, you're not okay
with us being engaged?

27:47.387 --> 27:48.453
No.

27:50.090 --> 27:51.422
No, of course not.

27:53.293 --> 27:55.193
Honestly, honey, we just thought that

27:55.228 --> 27:57.095
maybe it was all in his head.

27:58.164 --> 28:00.198
- We should have asked you.
- It's okay.

28:00.233 --> 28:03.468
I think it sort of all is in his head.

28:04.504 --> 28:06.437
I never said that I would marry him.

28:08.108 --> 28:09.374
We'll talk to him, okay?

28:12.312 --> 28:14.445
Would it be okay if
I talked to him first?

28:14.481 --> 28:16.214
Yeah, yes, of course.

28:19.152 --> 28:20.318
Come here.

28:23.089 --> 28:24.222
Thank you.

28:30.330 --> 28:31.396
Hey.

28:35.068 --> 28:36.434
Maybe my mom was right.

28:36.469 --> 28:38.302
About indulging Jesus.

28:38.338 --> 28:40.271
I can't take the path
of least resistance

28:40.306 --> 28:42.173
just because I'm
afraid of the outbursts.

28:42.208 --> 28:45.309
Hey, there's no "I" in
this. Okay, it's "we."

28:45.345 --> 28:46.444
It's "we."

28:48.114 --> 28:49.380
We're not giving up, okay?

28:49.416 --> 28:51.449
We're not giving in to
this thing with Jesus.

28:52.452 --> 28:54.252
We're gonna fight to get our boy back.

28:55.488 --> 28:58.122
Whatever treatment it
takes, we'll try them all,

28:58.158 --> 29:00.158
until something works, okay?

29:02.095 --> 29:04.262
- When are we gonna see that doctor in LA?
- In a couple weeks.

29:04.297 --> 29:08.299
Okay. So, in the meantime,
we take away that tree house,

29:08.334 --> 29:11.369
and whatever else we have
to, to get his attention.

29:12.505 --> 29:14.272
I know, baby.

29:23.216 --> 29:25.049
Have a good night, Brandon.

29:26.386 --> 29:28.352
Can I talk to you for a minute?

29:47.474 --> 29:49.107
What's up?

29:52.245 --> 29:54.378
Why... why did you cry...

29:54.414 --> 29:56.414
when you told me you were marrying Mike?

30:00.086 --> 30:03.321
It was, uh, just something Jesus said.

30:04.491 --> 30:06.224
That I still had feelings for you?

30:06.259 --> 30:08.459
Yeah. Yeah, it just...

30:09.395 --> 30:11.295
He has this crazy idea

30:11.331 --> 30:13.464
that you and I could still be together.

30:17.537 --> 30:19.403
What if we could?

30:23.409 --> 30:25.276
Look, I know I blew it.

30:28.248 --> 30:30.081
When I got out of prison...

30:31.351 --> 30:33.451
instead of feeling sorry for myself...

30:35.321 --> 30:38.089
I should have found you.

30:38.124 --> 30:39.157
And the twins.

30:41.127 --> 30:42.560
And we should have been a family.

30:46.332 --> 30:48.432
We... we still can be a family.

30:48.468 --> 30:50.568
I could be a father to Isabella.

30:53.239 --> 30:55.173
What if it's not too late?

31:00.346 --> 31:01.512
Because...

31:02.515 --> 31:04.282
I still love you.

31:06.119 --> 31:07.485
You have no idea

31:07.520 --> 31:09.487
how many times I've dreamed

31:09.522 --> 31:11.255
of you saying this.

31:11.291 --> 31:13.424
How long...

31:13.459 --> 31:16.260
I've wished you came back.

31:21.301 --> 31:23.234
But it is too late.

31:25.171 --> 31:26.470
I love Mike.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.540
And I can't wait to marry him.

31:38.351 --> 31:40.218
There you are.

31:41.354 --> 31:44.455
Shall we, uh, shall
we shut the door, or...

32:03.076 --> 32:04.308
I love you.

32:06.512 --> 32:08.145
But...

32:10.149 --> 32:13.184
But I can't wear this if it
means what you think it does.

32:21.494 --> 32:23.294
Wait. Um...

32:23.329 --> 32:25.229
Are you breaking up with me right now?

32:25.265 --> 32:27.131
No, I'm not.

32:29.402 --> 32:31.435
But we're too young
to be engaged, Jesus.

32:32.372 --> 32:34.338
And I can't be your only reason

32:34.374 --> 32:37.174
for wanting to go back to school.
You need to do that for yourself.

32:37.210 --> 32:39.443
Wait, I'm sorry. So,
that's why you said yes?

32:40.446 --> 32:42.346
I never said yes.

32:42.382 --> 32:43.476
Well, if that's how you...

32:43.477 --> 32:45.383
if that's how you feel, then
maybe we should break up.

32:47.220 --> 32:48.486
- Jesus!
- I'm not a charity case.

32:48.521 --> 32:50.421
I never said that you were!

32:50.456 --> 32:53.090
What, you think that I
can't survive without you?

32:53.126 --> 32:55.126
- That's not what I meant!
- You know what, Emma?

32:55.161 --> 32:57.161
I don't need you.

32:57.196 --> 32:59.030
Yes, you do, Jesus.

32:59.065 --> 33:00.464
She's stuck by you this whole time!

33:00.500 --> 33:03.367
She's been, like, the
best girlfriend ever.

33:03.403 --> 33:05.369
Oh, and now all of a
sudden, you like her?

33:05.405 --> 33:07.305
You guys are friends
again? Well, that's great.

33:07.340 --> 33:10.107
But you know what?
Leave me the hell alone.

33:10.143 --> 33:12.243
- Jesus.
- I mean it, okay? Let's just call it.

33:12.278 --> 33:15.079
- Don't do this.
- You need to stay out of this.

33:15.114 --> 33:17.315
And you, if you don't want me forever,

33:17.350 --> 33:19.183
then I don't want you at all.

33:19.218 --> 33:20.384
So just go!

33:23.423 --> 33:25.389
Just get out, Emma!

33:31.564 --> 33:33.331
You're so stupid.

33:56.522 --> 33:58.255
Emma!

34:00.493 --> 34:02.259
He doesn't mean it.

34:03.296 --> 34:04.462
I know.

34:06.299 --> 34:08.264
He's gonna get better. He really is.

34:10.469 --> 34:12.103
When?

34:17.143 --> 34:18.309
I miss him, too.

34:24.484 --> 34:26.484
- You don't have to do that.
- I don't mind.

34:26.518 --> 34:28.386
Ana's getting Isabella.

34:32.091 --> 34:34.125
She really loves you, Dad.

34:35.328 --> 34:37.328
Yeah, I know.

34:37.362 --> 34:38.396
Hey.

34:38.431 --> 34:40.364
I gotta get my bag.

34:41.467 --> 34:42.433
Okay.

34:44.237 --> 34:46.337
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.

34:57.116 --> 34:58.048
Hi.

35:08.261 --> 35:10.161
Protest is tomorrow, huh?

35:10.196 --> 35:11.295
Yup.

35:12.365 --> 35:14.131
I'm proud of you.

35:14.167 --> 35:16.100
You know that? Taking a stand.

35:17.103 --> 35:18.235
But?

35:22.074 --> 35:25.142
You're not a student at UCSD yet.

35:25.178 --> 35:27.144
You really want to do something

35:27.180 --> 35:29.346
that could jeopardize
your chances of getting in?

35:29.382 --> 35:32.516
So, I should just not express my beliefs

35:32.552 --> 35:34.518
- 'cause I'm scared?
- Mm-mm.

35:34.554 --> 35:38.289
No. No, it's just, uh,
just something to consider.

35:38.324 --> 35:40.491
A lot of these campus protests

35:40.526 --> 35:42.226
have been getting violent lately.

35:42.261 --> 35:44.228
- We're gonna be peaceful.
- Yeah, I know.

35:44.263 --> 35:46.464
It's not you that I don't trust, Cal.

35:46.499 --> 35:49.467
There are people who sometimes
like to take advantage

35:49.502 --> 35:53.204
of these emotionally charged
situations, create chaos.

35:54.440 --> 35:57.141
So, are you saying I can't go?

35:57.176 --> 35:58.275
No.

36:00.246 --> 36:03.147
I just want you to promise me...

36:03.182 --> 36:06.450
that if things do start to
get out of hand, that, uh...

36:06.486 --> 36:08.118
you will make the right call.

36:09.388 --> 36:11.422
Okay. Promise.

36:21.002 --> 36:22.484
You know, Stratos doesn't even care

36:22.486 --> 36:23.582
about Anchor Beach Academy.

36:23.756 --> 36:26.089
He just wants revenge against
Anchor Beach 'cause of Nick.

36:26.125 --> 36:28.959
I mean, it's crap. If anyone
deserves revenge, it's you and me.

36:28.994 --> 36:31.161
- 'Cause of what Nick did to us.
- You're right.

36:31.197 --> 36:33.197
I heard back from the
people at Eminent Power.

36:33.232 --> 36:34.765
And?

36:35.801 --> 36:37.868
They only want me.

36:37.903 --> 36:40.170
But we're girl and gay guy.

36:40.206 --> 36:42.172
I know, and that's what I told them.

36:42.208 --> 36:44.975
And, you know, even though
I really want to do it,

36:45.010 --> 36:47.945
and it's an amazing opportunity,

36:47.980 --> 36:50.013
I told them I won't do it without you.

36:50.049 --> 36:51.782
If you don't want me to.

36:52.218 --> 36:54.184
Y... you did?

36:54.220 --> 36:55.986
If you really don't want me to.

36:56.021 --> 36:57.154
Well, thanks.

36:57.189 --> 36:59.856
Screw them, right?
We'll do our own thing.

37:00.926 --> 37:02.893
I... I got to go to the bathroom.

37:27.820 --> 37:29.786
- My God.
- Oh! I...

37:31.123 --> 37:34.124
Uh, hi. I'm Brandon.

37:34.159 --> 37:36.827
Grace's girlfriend. Boyfriend.

37:36.862 --> 37:38.829
Well, I'm her mother.

37:39.898 --> 37:42.132
Uh, well, this isn't
what you think it is.

37:42.167 --> 37:43.200
Oh?

37:43.235 --> 37:45.836
It's... it's kind of a joke, actually.

37:45.871 --> 37:47.771
A few weeks ago, Grace...

37:48.240 --> 37:50.207
Never mind, it's not important.

37:50.242 --> 37:53.777
I'm sorry you have to
be meeting me this way.

37:53.812 --> 37:56.046
You know, Grace has no
business having a boyfriend...

37:57.082 --> 37:59.683
let alone going to prom, so.

38:00.819 --> 38:03.120
Uh, hey...

38:03.155 --> 38:06.156
- Uh, Mom, this is Brandon.
- Yeah, we've met.

38:06.191 --> 38:08.091
Well, I'm just gonna...

38:09.795 --> 38:11.728
go.

38:11.764 --> 38:14.097
Hey, um, the answer's yes, by the way.

38:14.133 --> 38:15.899
Prom.

38:15.934 --> 38:17.868
Well, I wish you would have
told me that the first time.

38:26.845 --> 38:28.745
Hey, how did it go? Did
you get the posters hung?

38:28.781 --> 38:30.180
- Yeah.
- No one was there. It was perfect.

38:30.215 --> 38:31.982
Great.

38:37.856 --> 38:40.757
- Hello.
- I need you to come to the school now.

38:45.230 --> 38:48.965

39:09.188 --> 39:11.722
- Our university's anti-hate!
- You came.

39:11.757 --> 39:13.890
Medium? Or maybe a large?

39:13.926 --> 39:15.692
You're pretty jacked.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.695
Two, four, six, eight,

39:36.115 --> 39:38.815
Two, four, six...

39:38.851 --> 39:41.718
So, I come in today to
get a little work done,

39:41.754 --> 39:42.953
and I find this.

39:42.988 --> 39:45.822
Oh, my God. Who did
this? Why would someone...

39:45.858 --> 39:49.126
No idea. So I checked
the security cameras,

39:49.161 --> 39:52.162
and your kids were the
last ones in the building.

39:55.134 --> 39:57.834
Yo, Gabe.

40:12.435 --> 40:13.960

- Nice turnout.

40:30.035 --> 40:32.202
Shiloh McCullen's a patriot.

40:32.237 --> 40:34.771
Hope you snowflakes melt in hell!

40:34.807 --> 40:37.808
- Hell is where the haters go, my friend.
- Get out of my country!

40:37.843 --> 40:39.910
Hey, it's her country, too!

40:39.945 --> 40:41.878
Go back to Mexico,
you Third World trash.

40:41.914 --> 40:44.080
- You! Stop that!
- Build a wall!

40:44.116 --> 40:45.982
Build a wall!

40:46.018 --> 40:48.118
