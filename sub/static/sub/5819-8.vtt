Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.360 --> 00:04.626
Freya: His prophesy
is fulfilled.

00:04.627 --> 00:07.066
You will all fall...
One by friend,

00:07.067 --> 00:10.107
one by foe, and one by family.

00:10.108 --> 00:11.530
We are called The Strix,

00:11.531 --> 00:14.970
the oldest society of vampires
this world has ever known.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.670
Elijah: Marcellus, you would do well
to be selective about the company

00:17.671 --> 00:19.538
you keep in future.

00:19.539 --> 00:22.875
Tristan: Aurora has procured
the exact location

00:22.876 --> 00:26.628
of Rebekah's watery grave
in two sealed envelopes.

00:26.629 --> 00:28.212
Hers contained the latitude.

00:28.214 --> 00:30.432
And Tristan got the latitude.

00:30.433 --> 00:32.301
[Crack]

00:32.302 --> 00:33.969
If you do not bring
my sister home,

00:33.970 --> 00:37.388
Tristan will die slowly
and in tremendous pain.

00:39.109 --> 00:41.609
You must be Cami.

00:42.812 --> 00:44.729

01:07.253 --> 01:10.221
Aw, poor dear.
Still sleeping?

01:11.424 --> 01:13.559
Well, you have a big day
ahead of you.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.760
We should get started.

01:16.763 --> 01:18.230
- Hah!
- Oh!

01:18.231 --> 01:19.815
[Tire iron clatters]

01:19.816 --> 01:22.935
That was not nice.

01:22.936 --> 01:24.269
Ok. You and I
need to have

01:24.270 --> 01:26.071
a little heart-to heart
conversation.

01:26.072 --> 01:27.822
Come along.

01:29.859 --> 01:31.744
What are we doing here?

01:31.745 --> 01:33.746
I heard a rumor
these men train here

01:33.747 --> 01:35.614
hoping to be made
into vampires,

01:35.615 --> 01:37.282
so I'm going to Grant
them their wish.

01:37.283 --> 01:39.167
Wait. Please.

01:39.169 --> 01:40.618
I don't know who you are,

01:40.620 --> 01:42.287
but if you have
a problem with me, fine.

01:42.288 --> 01:44.089
Just let them go.

01:44.090 --> 01:47.709
Huh, I assumed
you knew who I was.

01:47.710 --> 01:50.462
No matter. Allow me
to introduce myself.

01:50.463 --> 01:52.765
I am Aurora de Martel,

01:52.766 --> 01:55.217
long-lost love
of Niklaus Mikaelson.

01:55.218 --> 01:57.136
He and I are having just
a little bit of a spat

01:57.137 --> 01:59.470
at the moment, as he
took my brother captive.

01:59.472 --> 02:01.473
Now, it's come
to my attention that you

02:01.474 --> 02:06.278
are quite precious to him,
so I'm taking you,

02:06.279 --> 02:10.149
and these lovely, delicious,
delightful specimens

02:10.150 --> 02:12.818
are going to
provide incentive.

02:12.819 --> 02:15.571
Once they're in transition,
they'll need to feed,

02:15.572 --> 02:18.991
and since you will be the
only human blood available,

02:18.992 --> 02:22.995
well, Nik had better
give me what I want.

02:22.996 --> 02:24.379
Huh! Uh!

02:24.380 --> 02:27.249
Gentlemen, come down.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.301
Quick, quick.
Off you pop.

02:29.302 --> 02:31.669
Thank you.
Hello.

02:31.671 --> 02:33.839
You two, come on.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.808
Congratulations.

02:35.809 --> 02:37.509
You have all been
selected to receive

02:37.510 --> 02:41.096
the highest honor bestowed
upon your pitiful species.

02:41.097 --> 02:42.980
Don't do this.

02:48.238 --> 02:50.856
[Pants]

02:50.857 --> 02:52.573
- Uh!
- Uh!

02:55.028 --> 02:56.244
Next?

<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com/</font>

03:06.039 --> 03:07.873
the spell is complete.

03:07.874 --> 03:09.458
Tristan cannot
cross the boundary

03:09.459 --> 03:11.126
of his own will,
but we can enter

03:11.127 --> 03:13.212
and leave as we please.

03:13.213 --> 03:15.047
I took the Liberty
of injecting him

03:15.048 --> 03:16.881
with hibiscus and mugwort

03:16.883 --> 03:19.218
to counteract any
vervain in his system.

03:19.219 --> 03:21.553
All you have to do
is compel him

03:21.554 --> 03:24.556
to give you the longitude
of Rebekah's location.

03:24.557 --> 03:26.441
He says he's immune.

03:26.442 --> 03:29.528
Well, I'll find some other way
to make him talk.

03:29.529 --> 03:32.063
Will you?

03:37.237 --> 03:39.371
You're still upset
I tortured Aurora

03:39.372 --> 03:40.988
without your permission?

03:40.990 --> 03:43.242
Oh, Freya, I'm obscenely
fond of torture, but, yes,

03:43.243 --> 03:44.743
when I'm entertaining,
I like to be the one

03:44.744 --> 03:46.411
to choose precisely when

03:46.412 --> 03:49.548
and how we violate
the guests.

03:49.549 --> 03:53.385
Fine. How should
we proceed?

03:53.386 --> 03:55.170
Devastate the body,
infiltrate the mind,

03:55.171 --> 03:57.089
and steal the
information we need.

03:57.090 --> 04:00.592
To that end,
I invited a friend.

04:00.593 --> 04:02.844
I got your text.

04:02.845 --> 04:04.396
Unless she's
violently teething,

04:04.397 --> 04:06.265
I don't recommend
this as a day care.

04:06.266 --> 04:09.601
Jack's gone, and I don't
know if he's coming back.

04:09.602 --> 04:11.186
I also really don't
want to talk about it,

04:11.187 --> 04:13.355
so which one of you
will take hope.

04:13.356 --> 04:16.908
While I take my anger out
on this pompous dick?

04:19.779 --> 04:22.163
Come here, baby girl.

04:29.505 --> 04:31.089
Bon appetit.

04:31.090 --> 04:32.257
[Hisses]

04:32.258 --> 04:34.091
Aah!

04:39.098 --> 04:40.599
Not a fan of
knocking, are we?

04:40.600 --> 04:42.851
I afford courtesy to
those in my good graces.

04:42.852 --> 04:44.136
You've fallen short.

04:44.137 --> 04:45.637
Which is why I've
called you here.

04:45.638 --> 04:48.307
The whole Cami situation
has gotten a tad out of hand.

04:48.308 --> 04:50.475
Out of your hand.
You put her in danger.

04:50.476 --> 04:52.643
I put her in
protective custody.

04:52.645 --> 04:55.364
Her decision to leave
was rather ill-advised.

04:55.365 --> 04:57.698
See for yourself.

05:02.071 --> 05:04.122
I would say this
does not bode well

05:04.123 --> 05:06.624
for your friend Camille.

05:08.161 --> 05:09.962
Aurora is upset

05:09.963 --> 05:11.663
because I have
her beloved brother.

05:11.664 --> 05:13.799
She took Camille as leverage.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.835
Well, it'll be the last
mistake she ever makes.

05:16.836 --> 05:18.920
Might I suggest you
pause just a tick

05:18.921 --> 05:20.221
and think this through?

05:20.223 --> 05:22.223
Move now.

05:24.143 --> 05:26.011
If Aurora is upset with you,

05:26.012 --> 05:27.846
might she just be
leading you into a trap?

05:27.847 --> 05:29.564
Aurora has neither
the means nor the will

05:29.565 --> 05:30.682
to harm me.

05:30.683 --> 05:32.184
So you say, yet she is

05:32.185 --> 05:33.986
a vindictive lunatic.

05:33.987 --> 05:35.354
The prophesy said
you and your siblings

05:35.355 --> 05:36.688
would fall...
One by foe,

05:36.689 --> 05:38.940
one by family, one by friend.

05:38.941 --> 05:41.360
What is Aurora to
you if not a friend

05:41.361 --> 05:43.361
with certain benefits?

05:43.363 --> 05:45.697
Perhaps I should
murder my friends,

05:45.698 --> 05:47.199
starting with you.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.533
You are my sire.

05:48.534 --> 05:51.420
I have a vested interest
st keeping you alive.

05:51.421 --> 05:52.754
[Ding]

05:52.755 --> 05:54.039
That means I won't
sit back and watch

05:54.040 --> 05:57.926
while you walk
half-cocked into a trap.

05:57.927 --> 06:00.095
I'm coming with you.

06:00.096 --> 06:03.014
Just stay out of my way.

06:06.352 --> 06:08.854
Aurora: It's odd
you'd be his therapist.

06:08.855 --> 06:11.606
Isn't it true Nik
killed your beloved uncle

06:11.607 --> 06:15.059
right about... here?

06:17.063 --> 06:19.063
Yeah.

06:19.065 --> 06:21.033
It was a mercy killing.

06:21.034 --> 06:24.035
"Mercy." That is such
an odd, little word.

06:24.037 --> 06:28.456
Tell me, was it
difficult to watch?

06:30.043 --> 06:31.910
Yes.

06:31.911 --> 06:33.662
Hmm.

06:33.663 --> 06:35.047
This church hasn't
been much luck

06:35.048 --> 06:37.416
for your family, has it?

06:37.417 --> 06:39.835
You know about my brother?

06:39.836 --> 06:42.254
I confess, when I first
heard your name,

06:42.255 --> 06:43.722
I was intrigued.

06:43.723 --> 06:45.424
Nik cares for so few people,

06:45.425 --> 06:47.592
so I looked you up.

06:47.593 --> 06:50.262
The Internet,
it is such a marvel.

06:50.263 --> 06:52.764
I learned all about
your storied past.

06:52.765 --> 06:55.767
The insane twin brother
slaughters 9 seminary students

06:55.768 --> 06:58.236
and then does himself in.

06:58.237 --> 07:00.188
Wow.

07:00.189 --> 07:02.607
Are you enjoying this,

07:02.608 --> 07:05.444
bringing up the
tragedies of my life?

07:05.445 --> 07:07.496
Do you get off
on being cruel?

07:07.497 --> 07:11.782
Maybe I'm looking for the ways
in which we are alike.

07:13.169 --> 07:16.671
See, Nik's been obsessed
with me for centuries,

07:16.672 --> 07:21.093
and now he's
infatuated with you.

07:21.094 --> 07:23.628
What do you think
the overlap is between us?

07:23.629 --> 07:26.264
Is it crazy brothers?

07:26.265 --> 07:30.469
Yours was quite mad,
and mine, well...

07:30.470 --> 07:33.105
Tristan, I love him,

07:33.106 --> 07:36.725
but he can be
a bit daft sometimes.

07:36.726 --> 07:38.393
You know, he likes
to have me committed

07:38.394 --> 07:40.479
every so often,
hoping to cure

07:40.480 --> 07:43.398
my more eccentric
predispositions.

07:43.399 --> 07:46.451
Thanks to him, I've been
plunged into ice baths,

07:46.452 --> 07:49.538
bled for melancholia,
and exorcized for demons 5...

07:49.539 --> 07:53.408
No, 6... 6 times,

07:53.409 --> 07:58.296
and my latest diagnosis
is bipolar disorder.

07:58.297 --> 08:00.048
I imagine with
your credentials,

08:00.049 --> 08:01.416
you're familiar with it.

08:01.417 --> 08:02.801
And there have been
great strides in...

08:02.802 --> 08:04.002
Shut up, Cami.

08:04.003 --> 08:05.303
I prefer not to be
condescended to

08:05.304 --> 08:07.672
by someone who only
just got her degree.

08:07.673 --> 08:10.675
Now tell me a bit more
about you,

08:10.676 --> 08:13.177
starting with how
you feel about Nik,

08:13.179 --> 08:16.014
and do bear in mind,

08:16.015 --> 08:18.566
I am a stickler for honesty.

08:20.653 --> 08:24.940
Marcel: Yeah. I know exactly
how big the quarter is.

08:24.941 --> 08:29.778
Stop whining and find her,
and when you do, you call me.

08:29.779 --> 08:32.364
Aya: Trouble
in Crescent city?

08:32.365 --> 08:34.866
Nothing I can't handle.

08:34.866 --> 08:36.918
Such hubris, surprising,

08:36.919 --> 08:38.537
given your lack
of accomplishment.

08:38.538 --> 08:40.956
Tell that to
your boy Mohinder.

08:40.957 --> 08:43.842
Oh, that's right.
You can't. He's dead.

08:43.842 --> 08:45.844
Your boss killed him
right after

08:45.845 --> 08:47.796
I made him look like a chump.

08:47.797 --> 08:49.548
Is that how you recall it?

08:49.549 --> 08:51.516
Yeah. That's pretty much
how it went down.

08:51.517 --> 08:53.718
You are a skilled
revisionist.

08:53.719 --> 08:56.388
Why not tell me your
version of another tale

08:56.389 --> 08:58.056
about the witch regent
who was shunned

08:58.057 --> 09:00.108
by her own people?

09:00.109 --> 09:02.727
I don't know that one.

09:02.728 --> 09:04.646
Witch politics
isn't my thing.

09:04.647 --> 09:07.449
You were once guardian
to Davina Claire,

09:07.450 --> 09:09.201
and just as she's
about to be recruited

09:09.202 --> 09:11.036
by a consortium
of the most powerful

09:11.037 --> 09:13.572
vampires in the world,
her status as regent

09:13.573 --> 09:17.042
is revoked, making her
all but useless.

09:17.043 --> 09:20.295
You have to admit,
that's quite a coincidence.

09:20.296 --> 09:21.580
The covens hate me.

09:21.581 --> 09:22.914
You really think
that I got them

09:22.915 --> 09:26.551
to impeach their regent?

09:26.552 --> 09:28.670
It would be foolish
of you to defy

09:28.671 --> 09:30.805
the very organization
that had so recently

09:30.806 --> 09:32.724
granted you membership.

09:32.725 --> 09:34.759
After all, you
and your menagerie

09:34.760 --> 09:37.012
of downtrodden vampires
have only just begun

09:37.013 --> 09:40.765
to reap the benefits
we provide.

09:40.766 --> 09:44.903
The Strix have no tolerance
for insubordination.

09:44.904 --> 09:47.772
Oh, well, I guess I
better pay my dues.

09:47.773 --> 09:50.692
Funny you should
mention that.

09:50.693 --> 09:53.828
We do have a favor
we require.

09:53.829 --> 09:56.448
Tristan: Aah!

09:56.449 --> 09:58.166
[Panting]

09:58.167 --> 09:59.367
Don't be such a baby,
or I'll give you

09:59.368 --> 10:01.453
something to
really cry about.

10:01.454 --> 10:03.922
You mistake me, milady.

10:03.923 --> 10:06.758
I cry out only in grief.

10:06.759 --> 10:08.627
I was so struck
by your beauty

10:08.628 --> 10:10.295
when I saw you at the gala,

10:10.296 --> 10:12.796
and now, after this
affront to my person,

10:12.798 --> 10:15.967
I'll be forced to pluck
those lovely almond eyes

10:15.968 --> 10:19.054
from your
perfectly shaped skull.

10:19.055 --> 10:22.474
Elijah: My goodness,
I could watch this forever,

10:22.475 --> 10:25.644
if only my sister
wasn't trapped

10:25.645 --> 10:28.062
in the bottom of the ocean.

10:28.064 --> 10:31.066
Let me ask you again,
Tristan...

10:31.067 --> 10:33.818
The coordinates, please.

10:33.819 --> 10:38.322
Hmm, if I tell you,
you'll just kill me.

10:38.324 --> 10:41.959
The alternative is
significantly less pleasant.

10:43.379 --> 10:46.830
I think I'll hold off
on any confessions,

10:46.832 --> 10:49.834
at least until The Strix
arrive to free me

10:49.835 --> 10:53.805
and burn your home
to the ground.

10:53.806 --> 10:55.973
Elijah: Ooh...

10:59.345 --> 11:03.013
I think the pompous dick could
use a little more persuasion.

11:06.936 --> 11:09.186
You want to go to war
with the Mikaelsons.

11:09.188 --> 11:10.822
The Mikaelsons declared war

11:10.823 --> 11:12.356
when they took
Tristan captive.

11:12.358 --> 11:13.858
I'm calling on you as a Strix

11:13.859 --> 11:15.577
to come to the aid
of your brethren.

11:15.578 --> 11:17.411
By going on
a suicide mission.

11:17.413 --> 11:18.830
I assure you, Marcel,

11:18.831 --> 11:21.166
I have no suicidal
tendencies.

11:21.167 --> 11:24.703
What I do have is a weapon,

11:24.704 --> 11:27.455
one that can take down
even an original.

11:27.456 --> 11:28.707
It won't kill them,

11:28.708 --> 11:30.709
but it will subdue
them indefinitely.

11:30.710 --> 11:34.545
I used one much like it
on your darling Rebekah.

11:39.051 --> 11:42.470
That thing can take
down an original?

11:42.471 --> 11:45.640
You'll take this,
go into the Mikaelsons' home

11:45.641 --> 11:47.692
under the guise
of friendship,

11:47.693 --> 11:50.394
and then you will drive
this stake into Elijah's heart.

11:50.396 --> 11:52.397
We will free Tristan
and imprison the head

11:52.398 --> 11:54.866
of our sire line,
all in a single evening.

11:54.867 --> 11:57.068
Do this, and you
will have proven

11:57.069 --> 11:59.537
your loyalty to The Strix.

11:59.538 --> 12:03.575
Fail, and we will
revoke your membership

12:03.576 --> 12:06.577
and your life along with it.

12:17.674 --> 12:19.874
[Harmonica playing blues music]

12:22.762 --> 12:24.213
[Harmonica continues]

12:24.214 --> 12:26.547
[Door closes]

12:29.386 --> 12:31.603
You must be
the sister. Freya?

12:31.604 --> 12:34.056
- And who are you?
- Name's Mary.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.973
I'm a Crescent,
closest thing your niece

12:35.975 --> 12:38.444
has to a
great-grandmother.

12:38.445 --> 12:42.196
- Figure she's napping.
- That's right.

12:42.198 --> 12:44.066
And Hayley?

12:44.067 --> 12:47.735
She's across the street
helping with a family matter.

12:47.737 --> 12:51.406
Was that Elijah's idea?

12:52.959 --> 12:54.910
Hayley: Yeah. She's fine.

12:54.911 --> 12:57.829
She's a little rough around
the edges, but she's family.

12:57.831 --> 13:01.749
Don't worry.
I'll be there soon.

13:03.136 --> 13:05.254
Is everything ok?

13:05.255 --> 13:09.758
Just fun with
the in-laws.

13:09.759 --> 13:12.094
Jackson's grandmother
just showed up,

13:12.095 --> 13:14.179
which is very strange,
considering that

13:14.180 --> 13:16.180
he's out sulking
in the bayou,

13:16.182 --> 13:18.650
not that I can really
blame him, considering

13:18.651 --> 13:22.020
I didn't try to stop him
or run after him,

13:22.021 --> 13:24.573
mainly because I figured

13:24.574 --> 13:27.108
that you would need me here.

13:30.613 --> 13:36.417
You've done more than enough.
Go to your family, please.

13:47.297 --> 13:49.465
[Trumpet playing jazz music]

13:49.466 --> 13:51.800
Lucien: It's typical
of Aurora, forcing us

13:51.801 --> 13:53.435
to look for one
of her needles

13:53.436 --> 13:55.437
in a rather vile haystack.

13:55.438 --> 13:57.055
Yes. It's quite
the undertaking,

13:57.056 --> 13:59.558
made all the more onerous
by your incessant chatter.

13:59.559 --> 14:02.394
I speak so that I
might be listened to.

14:02.395 --> 14:05.647
Aurora clearly has
some devious plan in mind,

14:05.648 --> 14:08.484
which begs the question,
given how vindictive she is,

14:08.485 --> 14:11.152
why bother playing her game?

14:11.154 --> 14:13.572
I'm not playing for her.

14:13.573 --> 14:16.208
Ah, then...
Then tell me,

14:16.209 --> 14:17.743
what's the best-case
scenario?

14:17.744 --> 14:18.994
You save Cami today,
Aurora will just

14:18.995 --> 14:20.629
kill her some other time,

14:20.630 --> 14:22.331
and you can't very
well kill Aurora,

14:22.332 --> 14:23.799
given she alone has
the information

14:23.800 --> 14:25.467
needed to find Rebekah.

14:25.468 --> 14:27.386
I'm quite aware of
the dilemma, thank you.

14:27.387 --> 14:30.005
Oh, yet you're still
determined to rush

14:30.006 --> 14:32.341
into this harpy's trap.

14:32.342 --> 14:36.978
What for? Why do you
even care about Cami?

14:36.980 --> 14:39.181
I trust her,

14:39.182 --> 14:41.316
which is more than
can be said for you.

14:41.317 --> 14:43.519
Now, if you're gonna
help me, then help me.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.855
Otherwise, bugger off.

14:46.856 --> 14:48.907
All right.

14:48.908 --> 14:50.859
Ha ha ha!

14:50.860 --> 14:53.362
You really said that to him?

14:53.363 --> 14:56.698
"People are not awful.
They want to be good."

14:56.699 --> 14:59.534
Wow, a bit saccharine, no?

14:59.536 --> 15:02.204
Why don't you ask
your boyfriend?

15:02.205 --> 15:03.839
You feeling jealous?

15:03.840 --> 15:05.374
It seems as though you are,

15:05.375 --> 15:07.426
and yet you and Nik
are not lovers.

15:07.427 --> 15:09.877
You admitted so yourself.
You've never even kissed.

15:09.879 --> 15:11.964
We're not romantically
involved, no,

15:11.965 --> 15:14.349
but I do care about him.

15:14.350 --> 15:17.718
I see that he wants to
be more than what he is,

15:17.720 --> 15:19.187
and I don't think
you would do much

15:19.188 --> 15:20.522
to help him get there.

15:20.523 --> 15:22.641
You see the good in Nik.

15:22.642 --> 15:26.562
Tell me, are you the one
to bring it out of him,

15:26.563 --> 15:30.065
the frail, little human
that he has manipulated,

15:30.066 --> 15:32.317
abused, and compelled
to be everything

15:32.318 --> 15:34.703
from stenographer to spy?

15:34.704 --> 15:37.539
He doesn't care
about you, darling.

15:37.540 --> 15:40.659
You're just a thing that
he uses from time to time.

15:40.660 --> 15:42.744
That's all.

15:42.745 --> 15:44.663
You can say
whatever you want...

15:44.664 --> 15:46.915
I can't stop you...

15:46.916 --> 15:48.550
But I do find it interesting

15:48.551 --> 15:50.419
how angry you are.

15:50.420 --> 15:52.588
I think you're worried.

15:52.589 --> 15:54.423
If there's anything that
Klaus likes about me,

15:54.424 --> 15:57.059
it's my mind, that
I can understand him,

15:57.060 --> 15:58.594
and you,

15:58.595 --> 16:01.063
you are beautiful,
and you are powerful,

16:01.064 --> 16:03.849
and you do have a long
history together,

16:03.850 --> 16:06.184
but you're worried
he doesn't love you,

16:06.185 --> 16:08.320
that maybe he does
see the truth...

16:08.321 --> 16:10.489
That your mind,

16:10.490 --> 16:13.108
it's a bit damaged, isn't it?

16:13.109 --> 16:14.943
- Ah!
- Uh!

16:14.944 --> 16:16.944
[Sighs]

16:31.594 --> 16:34.462
I gave this to
Camille as a gift.

16:40.887 --> 16:43.805
Lucien: Ah, so now Aurora
has you attending church.

16:43.806 --> 16:45.807
Have you not had enough
of her leading you

16:45.808 --> 16:48.309
on a leash like
some lovesick imbecile?

16:50.446 --> 16:52.697
[Panting]

16:52.699 --> 16:55.150
Ok. I've had enough.
Now let's just...

16:55.151 --> 16:57.152
Let's shine the light
back on you, shall we?

16:57.153 --> 16:59.571
Tell me your deepest,
darkest secret,

16:59.572 --> 17:03.241
and if I sense that you
are holding back, well,

17:03.242 --> 17:06.827
you might not live long
enough for Nik to get here.

17:09.165 --> 17:12.000
Lucien: Will you please
listen to me?

17:12.001 --> 17:14.301
All I suggest is that
we find another way

17:14.303 --> 17:16.171
to deal with Aurora
than follow blindly

17:16.172 --> 17:18.140
along her
bread-crumb trail.

17:18.141 --> 17:20.258
You know, even as you talk,
I cannot help but recall

17:20.259 --> 17:21.676
you were the arrogant wanker

17:21.678 --> 17:23.145
who endangered Camille
in the first place.

17:23.146 --> 17:26.147
Well, better arrogant
than foolish.

17:26.148 --> 17:28.433
Your judgment
is off, my friend,

17:28.434 --> 17:30.686
and all because
of this mortal girl.

17:30.687 --> 17:34.823
Well, I say, let Cami die.

17:34.824 --> 17:37.693
All of your secrets
and vulnerabilities

17:37.694 --> 17:40.912
can die with her.

17:40.913 --> 17:41.913

17:41.914 --> 17:44.165
Ah!

[Chanting]

17:53.126 --> 17:55.544
He's as weak
as I can make him.

17:55.545 --> 17:58.880
If I push further,
I might kill him.

17:58.881 --> 18:00.765
Weak as I am,

18:00.767 --> 18:04.269
you still won't take
from me what you seek.

18:04.270 --> 18:07.189
It's an unpleasant thing,

18:07.190 --> 18:13.189
delving into such
a depraved and repellant mind.

18:13.613 --> 18:19.612
Tristan, unless you'd like me
to fetch the chainsaw,

18:20.536 --> 18:23.871
I recommend you
give me what I seek.

18:29.245 --> 18:32.047
[Panting]

18:32.048 --> 18:35.217
What did you see?

18:35.218 --> 18:36.752
Just flashes.

18:36.753 --> 18:39.471
He's resisting,
but still, Th...

18:39.472 --> 18:41.423
There's something else.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.593
It was a word.
What was it, Tristan, hmm?

18:44.594 --> 18:46.928
What is Cepheus?

18:46.929 --> 18:49.264
Marcel: What's next, charades?

18:49.265 --> 18:51.399
While you guys host the world's
most messed-up game night,

18:51.400 --> 18:53.235
you got bigger problems.

18:53.236 --> 18:55.102
Freya, would you mind dealing
with this situation, please?

18:55.104 --> 18:56.688
Oh, no offense to
your lovely sister,

18:56.689 --> 18:59.941
but you and I need to talk.

18:59.942 --> 19:02.277
I'm here on behalf
of The Strix,

19:02.278 --> 19:05.112
and I'm not leaving
without Tristan.

19:17.948 --> 19:18.974
Elijah, look.

19:18.975 --> 19:20.165
Marcel: The way I see it,
you don't have a choice.

19:20.166 --> 19:21.750
Is that so?

19:21.751 --> 19:23.919
How long before The Strix
decide to come get their guy?

19:23.920 --> 19:25.770
And if they destroy half
the quarter in the process...

19:25.771 --> 19:27.005
I can handle The Strix.

19:27.006 --> 19:28.372
Oh, you can't even
handle Tristan.

19:28.374 --> 19:29.758
He's about to O.D.
on wolf venom,

19:29.759 --> 19:30.992
and the only thing
that you can get

19:30.993 --> 19:32.794
out of him
is... is Cepheus,

19:32.795 --> 19:34.429
whatever the hell
that's supposed to mean.

19:34.430 --> 19:36.548
The guy has been around
for a millennium.

19:36.549 --> 19:39.267
He can withstand all
your vampire mind games,

19:39.268 --> 19:40.635
and if you end up
killing him,

19:40.636 --> 19:41.969
we lose Rebekah for good.

19:41.971 --> 19:43.939
So what are you
suggesting here, Marcel,

19:43.940 --> 19:46.391
I simply hand over
this wretched fiend

19:46.392 --> 19:48.310
and stand idly by
as you set him free?

19:48.311 --> 19:49.978
If I take Tristan,
make it look like

19:49.979 --> 19:51.479
I busted him out,
I get in tighter

19:51.480 --> 19:52.813
with him and The Strix.

19:52.815 --> 19:54.482
I can find out
where Rebekah is

19:54.483 --> 19:56.451
and keep them
from declaring war

19:56.452 --> 19:58.453
on the quarter
if you trust me.

19:58.454 --> 20:01.656
I will not
release that filth.

20:01.657 --> 20:02.991
[Sighs]

20:02.992 --> 20:04.825
Jack is my grandson.

20:04.827 --> 20:06.578
I love him,
stubborn as he is,

20:06.579 --> 20:08.330
and I know he loves you.

20:08.331 --> 20:09.798
Then where is he?

20:09.799 --> 20:11.967
Drinking whiskey,
chopping wood,

20:11.968 --> 20:13.552
shooting arrows,
gets that way

20:13.553 --> 20:15.503
when he doesn't
know what to do,

20:15.504 --> 20:17.922
and... and right now,

20:17.924 --> 20:19.591
he doesn't know
how to help you,

20:19.592 --> 20:21.009
which makes sense,
seeing as how

20:21.010 --> 20:22.894
you don't know how
to help yourself.

20:22.895 --> 20:24.846
What's that supposed to mean?

20:24.847 --> 20:27.899
After all the Mikaelsons
took from you,

20:27.900 --> 20:30.101
you're still over there
playing right along

20:30.102 --> 20:31.987
like you was one of them.

20:31.988 --> 20:36.524
They're my family, Mary.
They're hope's family.

20:36.525 --> 20:38.193
And when you got married,

20:38.194 --> 20:40.662
Jack became your family,

20:40.663 --> 20:42.197
and maybe they need you,

20:42.198 --> 20:44.865
but your husband
needs you, too.

20:47.837 --> 20:51.039
There really is
no need for this.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.125
You and I have
much in common.

20:54.126 --> 20:56.211
For one, we both
adore our sisters.

20:56.212 --> 20:58.513
Whatever we have
in common, trust me,

20:58.514 --> 21:00.048
it's outweighed by the fact

21:00.049 --> 21:01.850
that I want you dead.

21:01.851 --> 21:05.553
I must have spent centuries
looking for your family,

21:05.554 --> 21:07.856
only to find animals,
treacherous savages

21:07.857 --> 21:09.975
who betray even one another.

21:09.976 --> 21:11.559
Were you disappointed?

21:11.560 --> 21:14.562
They're my family, my blood.

21:14.563 --> 21:18.283
Such devotion,
it is admirable.

21:18.284 --> 21:21.035
I wonder, why does
it not extend

21:21.037 --> 21:24.072
to your poor brother Finn?

21:24.073 --> 21:27.242
What do you know about Finn?

21:27.243 --> 21:30.328
We were acquaintances
a thousand years ago.

21:30.329 --> 21:32.247
He was the most noble
of your siblings,

21:32.248 --> 21:34.666
and he knew me
as a man of my word.

21:34.667 --> 21:37.419
Why not ask him yourself,

21:37.420 --> 21:40.422
assuming that he
will speak to you

21:40.423 --> 21:43.307
after what you've
put him through?

21:50.099 --> 21:51.933
Aurora: I will not
ask again.

21:51.934 --> 21:54.602
Your greatest shame...
Admit it and do not

21:54.603 --> 21:56.521
bother lying because
I will know

21:56.522 --> 21:58.272
and then I will end you.

22:00.109 --> 22:03.161
Junior year of college,
I was arrested

22:03.162 --> 22:06.613
for assault, battery.

22:06.615 --> 22:11.920
Ooh, fabulous.
Now, that's more like it.

22:11.921 --> 22:13.671
Now do go on.

22:15.624 --> 22:20.545
It was some guy.

22:20.546 --> 22:24.799
He was dating my roommate.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.519
She tried to break up
with him, so he hit her,

22:27.520 --> 22:30.388
broke her nose.

22:30.389 --> 22:34.392
I tried to get her
to go to the police,

22:34.393 --> 22:38.780
the Dean, anybody,
but she was too scared.

22:38.781 --> 22:41.983
I hated that he was just
getting away with it

22:41.984 --> 22:45.486
like nothing ever happened.

22:45.488 --> 22:47.655
I saw him one night at a bar

22:47.656 --> 22:49.823
hitting on a freshman...

22:52.328 --> 22:55.330
So I took a beer bottle,

22:55.331 --> 22:57.831
and I smashed it in his face.

23:00.252 --> 23:02.837
The next thing I knew,
I was kneeling

23:02.838 --> 23:05.173
on his chest
and pounding his head

23:05.174 --> 23:07.175
into the floor,
and by the time

23:07.176 --> 23:09.727
they pulled me off of him...

23:12.898 --> 23:15.983
Well, he wasn't laughing.

23:22.024 --> 23:27.695
You're not ashamed
that you did it. Huh.

23:27.696 --> 23:31.365
You're ashamed
that you enjoyed it...

23:33.869 --> 23:36.621
And that's why you
study psychology,

23:36.622 --> 23:39.791
to understand
your own dark impulses.

23:39.792 --> 23:41.709
Here, I thought
I was the shrink.

23:41.710 --> 23:45.847
Ha! Well, I see why Nik
is so taken with you.

23:45.848 --> 23:48.349
The trouble is,
my burgeoning respect

23:48.350 --> 23:52.520
for you is overshadowed by
my somewhat puerile jealousy,

23:52.521 --> 23:55.557
so I suppose we've
reached the inevitable,

23:55.558 --> 23:58.192
wouldn't you say, my love?

24:02.698 --> 24:05.066
Stop this game.

24:05.067 --> 24:08.035
This is not a game, Nik.
This is an intervention.

24:08.037 --> 24:11.072
You're in danger of losing
the love of your life...

24:11.073 --> 24:14.075
Me.

24:14.076 --> 24:16.878
We're finally together
after so long apart,

24:16.879 --> 24:20.748
all the world before us,
if we can just dodge

24:20.749 --> 24:24.419
a few minor obstacles... like
this nuisance of a prophecy,

24:24.420 --> 24:26.838
my brother's internment,

24:26.839 --> 24:29.757
the insufferable influence
of Elijah...

24:29.758 --> 24:32.894
But what I cannot overcome
is your affections

24:32.895 --> 24:35.980
for someone else.

24:35.981 --> 24:39.267
I've waited far too long
to share you now.

24:39.268 --> 24:41.569
Call me jealous.

24:41.570 --> 24:44.605
I remember full well the
extent of your jealousies,

24:44.607 --> 24:47.025
but what surprises me
is that they extend

24:47.026 --> 24:51.779
to the, uh...
The lowly therapist.

24:51.780 --> 24:55.283
Aurora, you can't believe
she means anything to me.

24:55.284 --> 25:00.705
But I do believe it, Nik.
I see it, the fear in your eyes.

25:00.706 --> 25:03.290
Do you actually love her?

25:03.292 --> 25:07.095
You know I love you.

25:07.096 --> 25:09.797
I'm so glad
you admitted that.

25:09.798 --> 25:12.934
I wanted Cami to hear it...

25:12.935 --> 25:16.520
Before I rip out her throat.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.154
Klaus: Honestly, Aurora,
these petty displays

25:28.155 --> 25:30.023
are so far beneath you.

25:30.024 --> 25:32.508
Wild scavenger hunts,
threats against

25:32.510 --> 25:35.278
innocent acquaintances...
They cast you

25:35.279 --> 25:37.614
in a very unflattering light.

25:37.615 --> 25:39.366
Jealousy's more my game.

25:39.367 --> 25:41.918
Oh, would that I didn't
have the need for it.

25:41.919 --> 25:43.536
Why should you?

25:43.537 --> 25:45.705
Camille is no rival to you.

25:45.706 --> 25:48.124
Your fears are ridiculous.

25:48.125 --> 25:50.377
Nik, I have no doubt
that you love me.

25:50.378 --> 25:51.845
I was just hurt to learn
that you would

25:51.846 --> 25:54.881
lower yourself
to this distraction

25:54.882 --> 25:57.384
and particularly
when she constitutes

25:57.385 --> 26:00.303
a rather fiendish lie.

26:00.304 --> 26:02.389
You were drawn to her
under the mistaken belief

26:02.390 --> 26:04.724
that she is pure,
and she tells you

26:04.725 --> 26:06.893
that people want to be good,
but she's not quite

26:06.894 --> 26:10.196
the ray of unwavering sunshine
that you believe her to be.

26:10.197 --> 26:12.948
No. There is
a darkness in her.

26:14.702 --> 26:18.038
Why else would she
be drawn to the darkness?

26:18.039 --> 26:22.659
Why else would she be
drawn to you?

26:22.660 --> 26:25.662
See, I might have
my own imperfections,

26:25.663 --> 26:27.914
but at least I am not a fake,

26:27.915 --> 26:30.417
whereas Cami here,

26:30.418 --> 26:32.469

She's just an illusion.

- She's right.

26:34.839 --> 26:38.058
Klaus, everything
I ever said to you

26:38.059 --> 26:40.642
is a lie.

I'm not finished.

26:58.079 --> 26:59.446
Why don't you run along
to your little friends

26:59.447 --> 27:00.864
and remind them
that any attack on me

27:00.865 --> 27:02.615
is a really bad idea.

27:02.616 --> 27:03.750
That's not gonna work.

27:03.751 --> 27:04.951
They're as stubborn
as you are.

27:04.952 --> 27:06.920
So stay away
from them, Marcel,

27:06.921 --> 27:10.457
before I interpret your behavior
as an act of betrayal.

27:10.458 --> 27:12.925
That's the thing, Elijah.

before I even got here.

You talk a lot about
my loyalty to The Strix.

35:20.986 --> 35:22.987
How about your loyalty to me?

35:22.988 --> 35:24.538
We have every intention
of making good on...

35:24.539 --> 35:25.823
Don't give me that.

35:25.824 --> 35:29.243
Today was proof you
need me on your side,

35:29.244 --> 35:31.879
but if this is how
you treat your friends,

35:31.880 --> 35:33.664
I might not be there.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.133
He's right.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.086
Marcel, you've earned
a place at our side

35:39.087 --> 35:41.338
and everything that entails.

35:41.339 --> 35:44.474
Come with us.

35:45.677 --> 35:49.312
[Footsteps]

35:58.356 --> 36:00.691
Are you ok?

36:00.692 --> 36:03.694
Yeah. I'm doing a lot better
than the other guy.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.696
Well, then you're damn lucky

36:05.697 --> 36:07.865
along with being
damn foolish.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.200
The Mikaelsons are
a thousand years old.

36:10.201 --> 36:13.537
You're, what, 25
and with a baby?

36:13.538 --> 36:16.957
The way you risk your life
for those people,

36:16.958 --> 36:18.207
it ain't right.

36:18.209 --> 36:20.044
We all risk our lives, Mary.

36:20.045 --> 36:22.011
That's just the world
that we live in.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.264
Well, maybe, but you go out
of you way to help them,

36:24.265 --> 36:26.382
and every time you do,
you're tempting fate.

36:26.384 --> 36:29.136
I fight to protect
the people I care about,

36:29.137 --> 36:31.355
and if Jackson loves me,
then he would be here

36:31.356 --> 36:34.107
doing the same thing.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.982
He needs time.
I get it.

36:41.983 --> 36:45.369
Just tell him that
when he wants to talk,

36:45.370 --> 36:48.237
he should come home.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.961
[Cell phone chimes]

Strix have numerous
corporate assets,

37:08.593 --> 37:10.928
including private airlines.

37:10.929 --> 37:15.349
One of them specializes
in cargo jets.

37:15.350 --> 37:17.267
Now, according to Marcel,

37:17.268 --> 37:19.103
a vessel they favor the most

37:19.104 --> 37:22.606
has the codename Cepheus.

Records show this flight here

37:26.611 --> 37:28.112
left Marrakech to Miami

37:28.113 --> 37:29.946
the very night
our sister was taken.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.115
Now that we have the course,

37:31.116 --> 37:33.117
all we need to do
is match the path.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.753

I plucked from Aurora.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.254
"X" marks the spot.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.039
The very moment we have
our sister once again,

37:39.040 --> 37:40.707
Tristan and Aurora no
longer have any leverage

37:40.708 --> 37:42.459
whatsoever, and we are
free to deal with them

37:42.460 --> 37:45.462
however we choose.

37:45.463 --> 37:49.015
I recommend something
delightfully gruesome.

37:51.719 --> 37:55.138
Just make sure you
leave Aurora to me.

38:15.326 --> 38:19.329
If you ask me, Niklaus
is an utter fool,

38:19.330 --> 38:22.131
always has been.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.835
[Sobbing]

38:45.523 --> 38:47.908
Can I get you anything?

38:47.909 --> 38:49.610
I'm fine.

38:49.611 --> 38:51.778
I mean, my head is throbbing,

38:51.779 --> 38:54.581
but, all things considered...

[Madi Diaz's "ashes" playing]
