00:00.813 --> 00:02.774
Previously on <i>Smash</i>.

00:03.221 --> 00:05.342
How Marilyn, it's beautiful and tragic.

00:05.351 --> 00:06.996
I think she make a great musical.

00:07.062 --> 00:08.207
I've got a callback from Marilyn.

00:08.231 --> 00:09.948
I got a callback.

00:09.950 --> 00:11.617
Ivy Lynn, this is Karen Cartwright.

00:11.619 --> 00:13.485
Classic... you put in ten years
in the chorus,

00:13.487 --> 00:15.354
and Karen-something
shows up.

00:15.356 --> 00:17.623
I have a pretty clear sense
of what I bring to the party.

00:17.625 --> 00:18.991
She's trying to get me fired.

00:18.993 --> 00:20.659
He is taking advantage of her.

00:20.661 --> 00:22.027
Maybe Ivy's taking advantage of him.

00:22.029 --> 00:23.796
She did get the part.

00:23.798 --> 00:25.631
I could have done that.
I could have slept with him.

00:25.633 --> 00:28.617
But I didn't.

00:28.619 --> 00:30.502
You came into this marriage
with nothing.

00:30.504 --> 00:31.704
Except love.

00:31.706 --> 00:33.255
Jerry has no involvement.

00:33.257 --> 00:36.208
You poisoned my investors, you jackass!

00:36.210 --> 00:38.477
Got $7 million under there?

00:38.479 --> 00:40.829
No, but I do have friends.

00:40.831 --> 00:42.364
It was idealistic to think

00:42.366 --> 00:44.833
that we could do this without a star.

00:44.835 --> 00:46.719
The incomparable Rebecca Duvall.

00:49.774 --> 00:52.307
Her agent, her manager...
Everyone said she could sing.

00:52.309 --> 00:53.692
- You had dinner...
- Okay.

00:53.694 --> 00:56.061
And then you slept with my wife.

00:58.565 --> 01:00.032
No one applauded.

01:00.034 --> 01:02.334
I can't even see you talking to him.

01:02.336 --> 01:04.036
- It was nothing...
- Stop, Julia, stop.

01:04.038 --> 01:06.372
My God. Rebecca?

01:06.374 --> 01:08.574
I'm not going back into the show.

01:08.576 --> 01:10.376
Will you marry me?

01:10.378 --> 01:12.378
The real question is,
who's going to play Marilyn?

01:12.380 --> 01:13.879
Where's Karen Cartwright?

01:13.881 --> 01:17.166
You're going on as Marilyn, tonight.

01:17.168 --> 01:18.550
Why wasn't it me?

01:18.552 --> 01:20.252
She just had something that you don't.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.221
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

01:22.223 --> 01:24.673
You are fired is what you are, Ellis.

01:24.675 --> 01:26.492
I think I left something in your room.

01:26.494 --> 01:28.594
What are you doing
with my engagement ring, Ivy?

01:28.596 --> 01:30.062
I'm sorry.
We just need one minute.

01:30.064 --> 01:31.930
No, we don't.

01:31.932 --> 01:34.016
Actually, the more
you hurt, the better.

01:34.018 --> 01:35.517
Knock it off, Derek.

01:35.519 --> 01:38.687
Don't ever doubt you're a star.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:51.297 --> 04:54.633
After you.

04:54.635 --> 04:59.137
You can get the next one.

04:59.139 --> 05:00.940
Okay, everyone,
now that we're finally here,

05:00.941 --> 05:04.476
first things first, please...

05:04.478 --> 05:06.645
For a job well done...

05:09.850 --> 05:12.451
In Boston.

05:12.453 --> 05:15.537
That was then.
This is now.

05:15.539 --> 05:18.457
Eileen.

05:18.459 --> 05:20.826
I trust you all
enjoyed yourselves up there.

05:20.828 --> 05:22.995
We had a successful run.

05:22.997 --> 05:26.999
I would say, overall,
the experience was instructive.

05:27.001 --> 05:28.700
But before we apply its lessons,

05:28.702 --> 05:31.169
there's a small question of where.

05:31.171 --> 05:33.371
It is my goal to book us
a Broadway theater

05:33.373 --> 05:35.140
by the end of this week.

05:35.142 --> 05:37.676
In the meantime, if any
of you get any other offers,

05:37.678 --> 05:42.064
go on vacation, or frankly even
think about getting a haircut,

05:42.066 --> 05:43.381
let us know.

05:43.383 --> 05:45.550
While I'd like to publicly state

05:45.552 --> 05:48.687
that it is my intention to
pick up everyone's contract...

05:51.224 --> 05:54.176
Depending on the changes
made by the creative team,

05:54.178 --> 05:57.162
we may not be able to do that.

05:57.164 --> 05:59.815
But we're not there yet.
We thank you.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.868
And we hope to see you
on Broadway soon.

06:02.870 --> 06:04.536
And no raises, so don't ask.

06:08.425 --> 06:10.258
Karen, can I have a word, please?

06:10.260 --> 06:11.593
Sure. Yes.

06:11.595 --> 06:13.879
"Some of you will cease to exist

06:13.881 --> 06:15.931
after the creative team's changes"?

06:15.933 --> 06:17.916
- I'm not worried.
- You should be.

06:17.918 --> 06:20.085
She's part of the creative team now.

06:20.087 --> 06:23.055
If I were you,
I'd keep an eye on my back,

06:23.057 --> 06:25.223
make sure there's no target on it.

06:25.225 --> 06:28.259
I'm planning a little soiree
for the press this weekend,

06:28.261 --> 06:30.729
a sort of coming-out party
for the show.

06:30.731 --> 06:32.531
I'd love it if you'd sing something,

06:32.533 --> 06:34.566
perhaps the opening number.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.068
Of course.
Yeah, that'd be great.

06:36.070 --> 06:37.536
Anything for you.
Great.

06:37.538 --> 06:39.955
Well, maybe you'd like to choose

06:39.957 --> 06:41.957
a couple backup singers.

06:41.959 --> 06:44.126
It can be whoever you want.

06:44.128 --> 06:47.445
Well, Jessica and Beth, of course.

06:49.799 --> 06:53.301
And one more.

06:53.303 --> 06:55.921
- Joy.
- Joy. Great.

06:55.923 --> 06:57.472
Linda?
Yes.

06:57.474 --> 06:59.391
Would you grab Jessica,
Beth, and Joy for me?

06:59.393 --> 07:01.426
Hey, girls...

07:01.428 --> 07:05.564
I hope you're ready.
It all starts now.

07:27.366 --> 07:29.611
SMASH
S02 Ep 01x02 - On Broadway

07:29.712 --> 07:32.285
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

07:32.325 --> 07:34.159
Moving on...

07:34.161 --> 07:36.578
Michael Swift wants to be
let out of his contract.

07:36.580 --> 07:39.297
He feels that he did us a favor
when we were in a bind

07:39.299 --> 07:41.867
and we have ample time to recast.

07:41.869 --> 07:46.504
I, trust there are no objections?

07:46.506 --> 07:48.440
Nope.

07:48.442 --> 07:50.976
Okay, good.
Let's talk about the reviews.

07:50.978 --> 07:52.477
Remember, I haven't read them.

07:52.479 --> 07:55.147
- You're not serious.
- She never does.

07:55.149 --> 07:56.515
I just read Tom's face.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.366
It tells me everything I need to know.

07:58.368 --> 07:59.951
Did Tom's face tell you
what they singled out, then?

07:59.953 --> 08:01.620
Me, the cast...
Derek.

08:01.622 --> 08:03.205
She's the one who hasn't read them.

08:03.207 --> 08:05.791
I don't need some critic
getting in my head.

08:05.793 --> 08:07.542
I sat in the audience for three weeks.

08:07.544 --> 08:09.711
I know there are things
that need to be done.

08:09.713 --> 08:12.464
I want this to be the best it can be.

08:12.466 --> 08:13.866
And that's what we're going to do.

08:13.867 --> 08:15.967
After my meeting tonight
with Jordan roth,

08:15.969 --> 08:17.869
we're going to book the best theater

08:17.871 --> 08:19.471
Broadway has to offer...

08:19.473 --> 08:20.872
The St. James.

08:20.874 --> 08:23.675
The St. James
would be so amazing.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.560
<i>Oklahoma!</i> Opened there.
<i>The king and I.</i>

08:25.562 --> 08:26.678
<i>The producers.</i>

08:26.680 --> 08:28.046
- Big hits.
- Long runs.

08:28.048 --> 08:29.981
- Good juju.
- Yeah, okay, great...

08:29.983 --> 08:32.067
What if we don't get a theater today?

08:32.068 --> 08:33.852
I've got a lot of projects
waiting to hear

08:33.854 --> 08:35.687
how busy I'm gonna be...
I want to know what to plan for.

08:35.688 --> 08:38.323
Don't worry about it, Derek.
I'll get it.

08:38.325 --> 08:40.659
Meanwhile, keep our leading lady happy.

08:40.660 --> 08:42.510
Everyone's talking about her.

08:42.513 --> 08:44.162
They want to know if she's
as good as they've heard.

08:44.164 --> 08:45.730
She's better.

08:45.732 --> 08:48.200
Yes, we all know
where you stand on the matter.

08:48.202 --> 08:50.418
And it's not just me.

08:50.420 --> 08:52.403
Or didn't you read the reviews either?

08:52.405 --> 08:55.257
God, not listening.

08:55.259 --> 08:56.708
Going outside.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.510
"When Karen Cartwright implores you

08:58.512 --> 09:00.411
"to let her be your star,
you'd have no problem answering

09:00.413 --> 09:03.215
with a resounding 'yes, '
if it weren't..."

09:03.217 --> 09:04.733
I'm aware.

09:04.735 --> 09:05.851
It's not you I'm worried about.

09:05.853 --> 09:07.435
I'm handling it.

09:07.437 --> 09:09.221
Yeah, well, can we not do it
on Tom time, please?

09:09.223 --> 09:13.258
Sometime this century would be nice.

09:13.260 --> 09:15.010
Call me when you have a reason to.

09:16.396 --> 09:18.129
Bye, Derek.

09:18.131 --> 09:21.432
Thank you, Ana, for letting me move in

09:21.434 --> 09:23.201
and everything.

09:23.203 --> 09:24.619
Well, thank my roommate
for doing that Disney cruise.

09:24.621 --> 09:26.204
Where are you going tonight,
by the way?

09:26.206 --> 09:28.773
Derek is taking me
to see Veronica Moore

09:28.775 --> 09:30.275
and then meet her after.

09:30.277 --> 09:32.210
You get to meet her?
I'm so jealous.

09:32.212 --> 09:35.547
She's incredible.
You're gonna love the show too.

09:35.549 --> 09:39.134
It's about this, like, sweet,
1950s aretha/etta James type,

09:39.136 --> 09:40.552
but she has
this really overbearing mother.

09:40.554 --> 09:42.470
- Well, don't spoil it.
- Here.

09:42.472 --> 09:46.308
- How do I look?
- Like you care.

09:46.310 --> 09:49.127
Maybe I do.
See ya later, sweet cheeks.

09:49.129 --> 09:51.062
Bye.

09:51.064 --> 09:53.064
So what'd your agent say?

09:53.066 --> 09:55.734
When I told him that
he should expect a phone call

09:55.736 --> 09:57.802
about my contract,
he said that the agency

09:57.804 --> 10:00.822
had already received phone calls
for their other clients.

10:00.824 --> 10:02.640
Maybe they're calling alphabetically.

10:02.642 --> 10:04.109
They just haven't gotten to "l" yet.

10:04.111 --> 10:06.477
Did you get a call, Sam Strickland?

10:06.479 --> 10:08.496
Yeah.

10:08.498 --> 10:09.781
What can I do about it?

10:09.783 --> 10:11.750
Besides be on your best behavior...

10:11.752 --> 10:13.501
Which I know you already are...

10:13.503 --> 10:17.672
You got to find a way
to stay with the show.

10:17.674 --> 10:19.257
Any suggestions?

10:19.259 --> 10:22.660
Well, you're an amazing singer,

10:22.662 --> 10:24.346
an even better actress.

10:24.348 --> 10:25.830
Remind everybody why they fell in love

10:25.832 --> 10:27.349
with you in the first place.

10:27.351 --> 10:29.634
Once you do that,
you can get back on the road

10:29.636 --> 10:32.270
to becoming the star
you were intended to be.

10:32.272 --> 10:35.857
What is a star, anyway?
Do they even still exist?

11:17.184 --> 11:19.550
Now, ladies, listen up.

12:29.122 --> 12:31.389
- Hey.
- How you doing?

12:31.391 --> 12:32.924
I'm good.
Karen Cartwright.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.293
Veronica, you were incredible.

12:35.295 --> 12:36.794
Ronnie.
Great to meet you.

12:36.796 --> 12:38.430
Derek's told me all about you.

12:38.432 --> 12:40.098
Y'all give me a second.
Let me get dressed.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.633
And I'll be back.
Come in.

12:44.904 --> 12:46.637
You ready for your last performances?

12:46.639 --> 12:48.990
Not really.
It's sad to leave.

12:48.992 --> 12:50.992
It's time to move on.

12:50.994 --> 12:53.278
We're doing a revival of <i>The Wiz</i>
after I finish with you.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.313
I know.
I can't wait.

12:55.315 --> 12:57.832
Another good-girl role
for Broadway's sweetheart.

12:57.834 --> 13:00.668
As long as you keep
winning them Tonys, darling.

13:00.670 --> 13:03.321
If you don't mind me saying,

13:03.323 --> 13:05.623
the speech you gave
when you won your first one,

13:05.625 --> 13:07.959
about the things you gave up
when you started out

13:07.961 --> 13:09.844
and how those sacrifices
weren't for nothing,

13:09.846 --> 13:11.679
it was a huge inspiration to me.

13:11.681 --> 13:13.798
I have a question, Ronnie.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.800
What is the best piece of advice

13:15.802 --> 13:17.335
you would give to someone
who's about to get

13:17.337 --> 13:20.321
exactly where you are?

13:20.323 --> 13:22.941
That's easy.
Protect the work.

13:22.943 --> 13:26.861
The moment you lose focus,
the moment the work suffers.

13:26.863 --> 13:28.646
Someone's always waiting
to take you down, honey.

13:28.648 --> 13:32.984
But if the work's good,
they won't be able to.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.820
That's good advice.
Thank you.

13:35.822 --> 13:38.156
You're welcome.

13:39.825 --> 13:41.326
Get ready.

13:41.328 --> 13:44.329
This is gonna be you in six months.

13:52.671 --> 13:54.139
Look at 'em.

13:54.141 --> 13:56.558
Two years later, they're still smiling.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.676
So it's a piece of fluff.

13:58.678 --> 14:01.146
<i>Bombshell</i> will take us
to the next level.

14:01.148 --> 14:04.048
You know we have some stuff
to fix first, right?

14:04.050 --> 14:06.317
I mean, it isn't perfect.

14:06.319 --> 14:07.819
Of course.

14:07.821 --> 14:11.239
Everyone has their work to do,
even you.

14:12.409 --> 14:14.242
Okay. Time to go.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.027
I promised Frank that I would be there

14:16.029 --> 14:17.562
when he got home from his dinner

14:17.564 --> 14:19.864
with the new superintendent.

14:19.866 --> 14:22.200
I am so glad it's working out
between you two.

14:22.202 --> 14:24.536
We're trying.

14:24.538 --> 14:28.706
I know you are.

14:28.708 --> 14:30.675
So how long do you think
till we hear from...

14:30.677 --> 14:33.194
Eileen.

14:33.196 --> 14:36.881
Jerry.
I thought I felt a chill.

14:36.883 --> 14:38.216
That seat's taken.

14:38.218 --> 14:41.586
By, Jordan roth.

14:41.588 --> 14:44.222
I don't see him.

14:44.224 --> 14:47.225
Maybe he knows,
like everyone else knows,

14:47.227 --> 14:48.610
you don't have the capital yet

14:48.612 --> 14:51.362
to take <i>Bombshell</i> to Broadway.

14:51.364 --> 14:54.399
I could help.

14:54.401 --> 14:56.201
I have a lot of friends.

14:56.203 --> 14:59.120
Yes, mine...
The ones you stole.

14:59.122 --> 15:00.722
If only you would stop,

15:00.724 --> 15:02.907
stop thinking the worst of me.

15:02.909 --> 15:05.910
I know you,
and I know what you're up to.

15:05.912 --> 15:07.629
You saw my show, and you saw

15:07.631 --> 15:09.547
it was better than anything you have.

15:09.549 --> 15:11.716
So you called all the theater owners

15:11.718 --> 15:13.401
to block my way,

15:13.403 --> 15:17.255
hoping that I would come to you
in my time of need.

15:17.257 --> 15:19.307
If you want in, you should just say so.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.459
I want in.

15:21.461 --> 15:22.960
Get out of here

15:22.962 --> 15:24.812
before I throw another drink
in your face.

15:26.566 --> 15:27.932
Eileen, I'm so sorry I'm late.

15:27.934 --> 15:30.602
Jordan. Nonsense.

15:30.604 --> 15:32.820
You already called.
Does he know?

15:32.822 --> 15:34.989
No.
Should we tell him?

15:34.991 --> 15:37.408
I have offered
<i>Bombshell</i> to the St. James.

15:37.410 --> 15:38.826
Isn't that wonderful?

15:40.480 --> 15:43.448
It's Nick, my boyfriend.

15:43.450 --> 15:45.116
Excuse me.

15:45.118 --> 15:47.151
Hi.
Guess what.

15:47.153 --> 15:48.819
I hope you're sitting down.

15:48.821 --> 15:50.922
We're going to Broadway.

15:50.924 --> 15:53.958
Excuse me.

16:28.351 --> 16:30.551
And then people will clap,

16:30.553 --> 16:33.054
Eileen will speak,
and the other number will start.

16:33.056 --> 16:34.389
Another?

16:34.391 --> 16:36.190
Eileen only asked me to do one.

16:36.192 --> 16:38.059
It's not you.
It's Ivy and the ensemble.

16:38.061 --> 16:39.861
They're going to sing <i>Smash.</i>

16:39.863 --> 16:42.897
Linda, can we do something
about the angle of this piano?

16:42.899 --> 16:44.399
I feel like I can't see anyone.

16:44.401 --> 16:48.703
Well, sure.
What if we...

16:48.705 --> 16:50.371
I know you won't believe me,

16:50.373 --> 16:52.206
but this isn't about you.

16:52.208 --> 16:55.126
No, it's about you, as usual.

16:55.128 --> 16:57.745
Excuse me.

16:57.747 --> 17:00.781
Seems like old times.

17:04.970 --> 17:07.454
Can I ask you a question?

17:12.144 --> 17:14.561
Go ahead.

17:14.564 --> 17:18.799
What is my future
with this show exactly?

17:18.800 --> 17:20.935
I want to do everything I can

17:20.936 --> 17:22.637
to ensure that
when it opens on Broadway

17:22.638 --> 17:24.155
that I'm a part of it.

17:24.156 --> 17:26.073
And my agent still hasn't gotten
a phone call...

17:26.075 --> 17:30.144
That's why you asked to sing.

17:30.146 --> 17:32.780
Okay, here's my answer.
It's not gonna be easy.

17:32.782 --> 17:35.983
You need to apologize to Karen

17:35.985 --> 17:38.486
for whatever it is that went on
between you two.

17:38.488 --> 17:40.655
I already did, in Boston.

17:42.342 --> 17:46.093
Well, maybe you were apologizing
for the wrong thing.

17:46.095 --> 17:49.597
After the whole Michael...

17:49.599 --> 17:50.998
Well, you know...

17:52.802 --> 17:55.269
I spent a lot of time
telling my husband

17:55.271 --> 17:59.106
I was sorry for what I did.

17:59.108 --> 18:02.510
But it meant nothing until I apologized

18:02.512 --> 18:04.779
for why I did it.

18:04.781 --> 18:06.814
If you could stop making this
about what happened

18:06.816 --> 18:09.650
and tell her why it did,

18:09.652 --> 18:12.787
you might just get a second chance.

18:12.789 --> 18:15.439
Ivy, you're up.

18:15.441 --> 18:17.825
Good luck.

18:17.827 --> 18:20.111
I'm rooting for you.

18:20.113 --> 18:22.363
So, Derek,
another big moment for you...

18:22.365 --> 18:23.664
<i>Bombshell</i> and <i>The Wiz</i>

18:23.666 --> 18:25.199
treading the boards the same season.

18:26.703 --> 18:28.052
Did you see the show in Boston?

18:28.054 --> 18:29.554
Not only did I see it,

18:29.556 --> 18:31.472
I saw it with Rebecca Duvall.

18:31.474 --> 18:33.374
I don't suppose you have
anything to say

18:33.376 --> 18:37.328
about her abrupt exit from the show?

18:39.982 --> 18:42.600
No comment.
Really?

18:45.972 --> 18:47.555
Okay.

18:47.557 --> 18:51.375
Okay, Rebecca Duvall is a superstar.

18:51.377 --> 18:55.396
And like most superstars,
she knows what she's good at...

18:55.398 --> 18:57.999
And what she isn't.

18:58.001 --> 18:59.500
If I didn't know any better, I'd think

18:59.502 --> 19:01.235
you were suggesting
she poisoned herself

19:01.237 --> 19:02.503
to get out of her contract.

19:02.505 --> 19:03.871
I did not say that, Michael,

19:03.873 --> 19:09.093
but it would've made a better story.

19:09.095 --> 19:11.345
You gonna sit down and order something?

19:11.347 --> 19:14.382
No. I'm... I'm waiting
for my friend.

19:14.384 --> 19:16.584
Get you something while you wait, then?

19:16.586 --> 19:19.687
No.
Thanks.

19:19.689 --> 19:22.256
I'm Jimmy, by the way.

19:22.258 --> 19:25.443
Do you talk
to all your customers this much?

19:25.445 --> 19:27.278
Are you a customer?

19:27.280 --> 19:29.063
I thought you were just another actress

19:29.065 --> 19:30.598
taking a meeting at my station

19:30.600 --> 19:33.367
who won't order anything
but a glass of water.

19:33.369 --> 19:35.453
I'm not like that.

19:35.455 --> 19:37.038
Karen?

19:37.040 --> 19:39.123
Michael Riedel.

19:39.125 --> 19:40.708
I can't wait to see you in the show.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.109
I hear amazing things.

19:42.111 --> 19:45.796
Thanks.
Thank you.

19:45.798 --> 19:48.249
Still or sparkling?

19:48.251 --> 19:51.052
Tap.

19:51.054 --> 19:52.637
Hey.

19:52.639 --> 19:55.640
I got your text.
Is everything okay?

19:55.642 --> 19:58.893
Did you know about Ivy
singing at the party?

19:58.895 --> 20:00.394
No.

20:00.396 --> 20:02.480
I keep thinking about what Ronnie said

20:02.482 --> 20:04.148
about protecting the work,

20:04.150 --> 20:05.900
and I'm worried
I won't be able to with Ivy

20:05.902 --> 20:07.401
in my face all the time.
I mean, I thought...

20:07.403 --> 20:09.136
Just say the word...

20:09.138 --> 20:13.140
And I will let her go.

20:13.142 --> 20:16.410
Okay.

20:16.412 --> 20:19.413
Consider it done.

20:19.415 --> 20:21.315
How was your meeting with Casey?

20:21.317 --> 20:24.585
He offered me the general
in the <i>book of mormon</i> tour.

20:24.587 --> 20:27.488
That's...
I mean, congratulations!

20:27.490 --> 20:29.256
It's a great part, but I think

20:29.258 --> 20:30.925
I'm gonna stay in the city, you know?

20:30.927 --> 20:33.928
For <i>bombsh...</i>
<i>You have ten lines in our show.</i>

20:33.930 --> 20:35.763
In <i>mormon,</i> you'd be front and center.

20:35.765 --> 20:37.765
Without you.

20:37.767 --> 20:40.000
Sometimes you have
to put what's right for you

20:40.002 --> 20:42.002
above what's right for someone else.

20:42.004 --> 20:43.837
Have you ever done that?

20:43.839 --> 20:45.356
You didn't allow yourself
to feel a second of happiness

20:45.358 --> 20:46.840
over the reviews you got.

20:46.842 --> 20:48.359
I mean, what did <i>Variety</i> say again?

20:48.361 --> 20:50.778
I...
"Levitt's score is a marvel,

20:50.780 --> 20:53.531
"full of charm and pizzazz
in its pastiche numbers

20:53.533 --> 20:56.817
and unparalleled emotion
in its introspective moments."

20:56.819 --> 20:59.537
Look, I allowed myself
some happiness in private.

20:59.539 --> 21:00.988
I just didn't want it to seem

21:00.990 --> 21:02.790
like I was gloating around Julia.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.458
I mean, she got...
Slammed in reviews

21:04.460 --> 21:06.694
she doesn't even know about.

21:06.696 --> 21:09.380
They loved her lyrics.

21:09.382 --> 21:11.632
I'll tell her, in time, just not yet.

21:11.634 --> 21:14.868
Her focus needs to be on her marriage.

21:14.870 --> 21:17.004
We're partners, Sam.
It's my job to protect her.

21:17.006 --> 21:18.372
As her partner, it's your job

21:18.374 --> 21:19.807
to be the one person who doesn't.

21:19.809 --> 21:20.874
I mean, if you can't tell her, who can?

21:20.876 --> 21:22.226
Maybe I'll never have to.

21:22.228 --> 21:25.396
Maybe she'll figure out her problems...

21:25.398 --> 21:27.565
Is that...

21:27.567 --> 21:29.600
Frank?

21:43.432 --> 21:45.700
- My God, is this for real?
- Yeah.

21:45.702 --> 21:48.036
"Rebecca Duvall
has just released a statement

21:48.038 --> 21:51.373
"claiming the reason she left
Broadway-bound musical <i>Bombshell</i>

21:51.375 --> 21:54.776
"was not due to illness
as previously reported,

21:54.778 --> 21:57.095
"but because the director, Derek Wills,

21:57.097 --> 22:00.115
sexually harassed her
in her dressing room."

22:00.117 --> 22:01.800
Is this some sort of joke?

22:01.802 --> 22:03.284
Everyone knows Rebecca Duvall
would sleep

22:03.286 --> 22:04.719
with a follow spot operator

22:04.721 --> 22:06.304
if it meant more light
on her downstage.

22:06.306 --> 22:08.256
This must be
what Derek called me about.

22:08.258 --> 22:10.291
Find you guys later?

22:10.293 --> 22:12.060
There's something
I have to take care of first.

22:12.062 --> 22:14.763
- Good luck.
- Your life depends on it.

22:14.765 --> 22:16.898
Thanks for understanding.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.150
What, some actress
throwing you under the bus

22:19.152 --> 22:20.652
to save face?

22:20.654 --> 22:22.404
You may be a womanizer,

22:22.406 --> 22:24.439
but I know there's no merit
to her story.

22:24.441 --> 22:25.824
Yeah, well, you might want to tell that

22:25.826 --> 22:28.109
to the producers of <i>The Wiz</i> for me.

22:28.111 --> 22:30.478
- I'll call 'em now.
- Thank you.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.498
I'll say hello to Eileen.

22:36.652 --> 22:38.587
And here I was,

22:38.589 --> 22:41.339
throwing a party and thinking
I could talk about the show

22:41.341 --> 22:43.508
and not its director's personal life.

22:43.510 --> 22:45.010
Michael Riedel
said he's coming tonight.

22:45.012 --> 22:46.628
I want you to turn him away
at the door.

22:46.630 --> 22:47.630
I don't think so.

22:47.631 --> 22:48.763
He is the reason

22:48.765 --> 22:49.998
she retaliated the way she did.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.666
He just ran a quote out of context.

22:51.668 --> 22:53.101
I don't blame Michael Riedel
for your mess,

22:53.103 --> 22:54.686
and neither should you.

22:54.688 --> 22:56.471
Now, let's just hope it doesn't blow up

22:56.473 --> 22:57.939
into something bigger.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.524
I'm going to see if Jordan's arrived

22:59.526 --> 23:01.092
for the announcement.

23:01.094 --> 23:02.811
Frank!
It's so good to see you!

23:02.813 --> 23:04.345
Hey, Linda, how are you?

23:04.347 --> 23:06.481
Better, now that I've had a break.

23:06.483 --> 23:08.116
How are you?

23:08.118 --> 23:10.852
- I'm good. Thanks.
- That's wonderful.

23:10.854 --> 23:13.288
You know how much I've always admired

23:13.290 --> 23:15.974
you and Julia's relationship.

23:15.976 --> 23:17.626
Our relationship?

23:17.628 --> 23:19.027
Yes.

23:19.029 --> 23:21.362
I'm glad you've worked it out.

23:21.364 --> 23:25.884
Yeah, we...
We did. Thanks.

23:27.888 --> 23:29.387
Hi.

23:29.389 --> 23:31.556
Okay, here we go.

23:31.558 --> 23:34.309
Eileen had the cocktails
named after Marilyn movies.

23:34.311 --> 23:35.543
Isn't that cute?

23:35.545 --> 23:38.313
I got you
a "clash by night."

23:38.315 --> 23:41.566
- Does everyone know?
- Know what?

23:41.568 --> 23:43.468
Linda just told me how happy she is

23:43.470 --> 23:45.003
that we're working on our marriage.

23:45.005 --> 23:47.289
Does everyone know about Michael?

23:51.661 --> 23:56.364
Shows are like families.
Everyone knows everything.

23:56.366 --> 23:58.750
Of course.
How could I ever think

23:58.752 --> 24:01.086
that our private life is private?

24:04.874 --> 24:08.910
I'll take
another "clash by night."

24:10.596 --> 24:12.914
Maybe...
Maybe I shouldn't say anything.

24:12.916 --> 24:15.433
It could've just been a good-bye
between good friends...

24:15.435 --> 24:17.102
Very good friends.

24:17.104 --> 24:20.221
She's your best friend.
You should tell her.

24:21.358 --> 24:23.274
Wha you can't make it?

24:23.276 --> 24:25.527
Why not?

24:25.529 --> 24:27.529
What do you mean "let's talk tomorrow"?

24:27.531 --> 24:31.900
Well, do I still have
the theater, or don't I?

24:33.102 --> 24:36.988
No, you don't have to go.

24:39.441 --> 24:41.042
Jordan roth isn't coming.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.276
Something must've happened.

24:42.278 --> 24:44.129
Maybe he heard about Rebecca.

24:44.131 --> 24:46.381
Maybe he read Julia's reviews.

24:46.383 --> 24:48.917
Well, the press are here
waiting for an announcement.

24:48.919 --> 24:51.219
If he doesn't show,
they're gonna notice.

24:51.221 --> 24:53.455
I need something to distract them

24:53.457 --> 24:56.391
while I get to the bottom of this.

24:56.393 --> 24:58.676
Why not use her?

25:02.732 --> 25:04.899
Hi.

25:04.901 --> 25:07.569
Good thinking.

25:07.571 --> 25:11.156
Everybody, please,
put your hands together

25:11.158 --> 25:14.409
for <i>Bombshell</i> very own
Marilyn, Karen Cartwright,

25:14.411 --> 25:16.745
plus, a very special guest...

25:16.747 --> 25:19.914
Two-time Tony award winner
Veronica Moore.

27:46.562 --> 27:48.479
Thanks.

27:48.481 --> 27:51.816
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

27:54.486 --> 27:56.637
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

27:56.639 --> 28:00.992
I wasn't doing so well,
but I feel better.

28:00.994 --> 28:02.644
How did you do that?

28:02.646 --> 28:06.264
I'm your muse.
It's what we do.

28:25.667 --> 28:27.385
Just...

28:31.857 --> 28:34.175
Is that why you called me...

28:34.177 --> 28:36.861
To tell me you're with Karen?
Because you didn't have to.

28:36.863 --> 28:40.648
It's very clear to everyone...
Look, I am not with Karen.

28:40.650 --> 28:42.367
And that is not why I called you.

28:42.369 --> 28:44.819
Well, then why did you call me?

28:49.024 --> 28:51.960
My God.

28:51.962 --> 28:55.463
You're letting me go.

28:55.465 --> 28:58.316
Because of her?
Ivy.

29:06.141 --> 29:10.345
What happened to the drinks?

29:10.347 --> 29:13.998
Who were you with tonight
before you met me?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.734
What?
No one.

29:16.736 --> 29:18.870
Tom saw you.

29:24.076 --> 29:26.361
She's just...

29:26.363 --> 29:29.764
Someone from school, you know,
the new superintendent.

29:29.766 --> 29:31.565
It was nothing.

29:31.567 --> 29:34.252
Well, then why didn't you just
tell me you were meeting?

29:34.254 --> 29:37.038
Are you kidding me with this?

29:37.040 --> 29:38.373
It's just a question.

29:38.375 --> 29:39.757
I'm not accusing you of anything.

29:39.759 --> 29:42.260
Not accusing me?
My God, Julia, really?

29:42.262 --> 29:44.545
Coming from you?

29:49.352 --> 29:50.668
Frank.

29:50.670 --> 29:52.887
Frank.
No, Julia.

29:52.889 --> 29:54.522
I can't believe this...

29:54.524 --> 29:56.024
Suspecting me of something

29:56.026 --> 29:57.775
when you're the one who did everything.

29:57.777 --> 29:59.360
Frank, calm down.

29:59.362 --> 30:00.945
And you didn't do it just once either.

30:00.947 --> 30:02.864
And that's just the affairs
that I know about.

30:02.866 --> 30:05.033
Frank, let's just
talk about this calmly, okay?

30:05.035 --> 30:07.919
You know what?
Mary, the woman from school...

30:07.921 --> 30:09.203
I didn't sleep with her.

30:09.205 --> 30:11.439
I wanted to.
Maybe...

30:11.441 --> 30:13.791
Maybe I should to even the score?

30:13.793 --> 30:15.609
Would that make it okay?

30:15.611 --> 30:17.712
Or should I just sleep
with someone in the cast...

30:17.714 --> 30:20.381
Keep it in the family?
After all, you did, and Tom did.

30:20.383 --> 30:22.967
And... and Derek did
with every actress

30:22.969 --> 30:25.086
who put on a Marilyn wig.

30:25.088 --> 30:28.089
Why the hell can't I?
Can I quote you on that?

30:28.091 --> 30:31.142
Come on.

30:39.634 --> 30:41.569
Karen.

30:44.240 --> 30:47.075
- Look, I...
- I...

30:47.077 --> 30:50.278
After you.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.613
- Having me fired...
- Ivy, I...

30:52.615 --> 30:55.333
Was absolutely right.

30:55.335 --> 30:56.751
You hate me.

30:56.753 --> 30:59.404
You should.

30:59.406 --> 31:01.739
But even you can't hate me
as much as I hate myself

31:01.741 --> 31:04.258
for what I did.

31:04.260 --> 31:06.427
And the crazy part

31:06.429 --> 31:08.662
is that you don't even know
how bad it got.

31:08.664 --> 31:11.749
That night
of your first preview in Boston,

31:11.751 --> 31:15.286
I was a mess.

31:15.288 --> 31:19.774
I almost...

31:19.776 --> 31:24.378
I almost did something really stupid.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.614
And for what?

31:28.550 --> 31:30.968
Because I was jealous?

31:30.970 --> 31:34.539
Because of a part in some show?

31:34.541 --> 31:37.391
I'm truly sorry...

31:37.393 --> 31:39.627
That I ever got in your way.

31:39.629 --> 31:42.563
Good luck.

31:42.565 --> 31:45.399
You deserve it.

31:58.781 --> 32:00.448
What happened?

32:00.450 --> 32:02.316
And where's Frank?

32:02.318 --> 32:04.335
Gone.

32:06.655 --> 32:09.507
My marriage is over.

32:09.509 --> 32:11.559
I'm so sorry.

32:23.623 --> 32:25.372
And to think that,

32:25.374 --> 32:26.908
I thought, when I saw your face,

32:26.910 --> 32:30.228
that you were gonna tell me
about the reviews.

32:32.882 --> 32:36.383
I promised I wouldn't.

32:36.385 --> 32:37.969
I read them opening night.

32:37.971 --> 32:40.238
I pretended that I didn't

32:40.240 --> 32:44.408
'cause I was so mortified.

32:44.410 --> 32:47.028
Everything that I've done...

32:49.698 --> 32:53.835
Has turned out so wrong.

32:53.837 --> 32:58.155
What if I can't fix it?

32:58.157 --> 33:01.259
I'll help you.

33:01.261 --> 33:02.760
I'm your partner.

33:13.189 --> 33:15.857
Eileen, hi.

33:15.859 --> 33:19.010
I know Derek was gonna let Ivy go.

33:19.012 --> 33:20.394
But I've been thinking...

33:20.396 --> 33:21.929
Eileen, before we even print a word...

33:21.931 --> 33:23.614
Sorry, excuse me, darling.
Okay, I got a plan.

33:23.616 --> 33:25.733
You need to make a statement
in support of me, please.

33:25.735 --> 33:27.034
I can't do that, Derek.

33:27.036 --> 33:28.369
Yeah, you can.
Just do it.

33:28.371 --> 33:29.770
This place is all full of journalists.

33:29.772 --> 33:32.106
Just pick one.
I'm serious, Eileen.

33:32.108 --> 33:33.958
If you want me to continue
with the show, you...

33:33.960 --> 33:36.878
I don't give a damn what you do, Derek.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.213
There is no show.

33:39.215 --> 33:41.582
What do you mean, there's no show?

33:41.584 --> 33:43.301
Someone tipped off the government

33:43.303 --> 33:44.552
about the money I've been using

33:44.554 --> 33:46.254
to finance the show

33:46.256 --> 33:48.556
and who it came from.

33:48.558 --> 33:51.125
<i>Bombshell</i> is under investigation

33:51.127 --> 33:53.477
and, as such, is frozen,

33:53.479 --> 33:55.897
along with the remaining funds.

33:55.899 --> 33:57.148
Now, if you'll forgive me,

33:57.150 --> 34:01.135
I have to go talk to my lawyers.

34:07.645 --> 34:08.869
I saw what happen.

34:10.755 --> 34:12.054
All this hard work...

34:12.056 --> 34:13.407
It can't really be over, can it?

34:13.409 --> 34:14.891
It's not unheard of, you know.

34:14.893 --> 34:16.259
That's crazy.

34:16.261 --> 34:17.895
A whole year gone by...

34:17.897 --> 34:19.696
It's like waking up from some dream.

34:19.697 --> 34:21.231
Yeah, well, at least you woke up.

34:21.233 --> 34:23.534
It looks like my nightmare
is just beginning.

34:23.536 --> 34:27.137
If I lose <i>The Wiz</i> and <i>Bombshell...</i>

34:27.139 --> 34:29.956
Maybe I can help?

34:29.958 --> 34:33.443
I'm still your muse, aren't I?

34:33.445 --> 34:35.661
Yeah, something like that.

34:38.949 --> 34:40.717
Look, I hope you find something else

34:40.719 --> 34:43.954
for yourself, Karen...

34:43.956 --> 34:47.306
Something that hits you
the way <i>Bombshell</i> hit me.

34:49.793 --> 34:52.646
If you do...

34:52.648 --> 34:55.649
Give me a call.

34:55.650 --> 34:58.936
I might need a job.

35:08.814 --> 35:10.146
How you feeling?

35:14.503 --> 35:17.838
As bad as I should.

35:19.625 --> 35:22.676
You really don't mind me crashing here?

35:22.678 --> 35:24.494
Not as long as you can make room

35:24.496 --> 35:27.498
on this sofa for me.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.033
I'm gonna tell Sam
he should take the tour.

35:30.035 --> 35:31.835
I'm sorry.

35:31.837 --> 35:35.439
Single again, at this age...

35:35.441 --> 35:38.341
Who'd want me?

35:38.343 --> 35:40.343
Anyone in their right mind.

35:40.345 --> 35:42.178
Then I probably wouldn't want them.

35:45.017 --> 35:46.283
You know what?

35:46.285 --> 35:47.651
Why don't you just stay here?

35:47.653 --> 35:49.469
- What?
- Why not?

35:49.471 --> 35:51.354
It'll be like old times...

35:51.356 --> 35:52.522
Or a sitcom.

35:52.524 --> 35:55.859
Maybe even get some work done.

35:55.861 --> 35:57.961
Plus, I'd get to see Leo more.

35:57.963 --> 35:59.195
I mean, if you really mean it,

35:59.197 --> 36:00.998
just, you know...
Just until I figure out

36:01.000 --> 36:02.032
what's happening.

36:02.034 --> 36:04.868
Don't make me beg.

36:04.870 --> 36:06.553
Okay, wait.

36:06.555 --> 36:09.372
One condition, though.

36:09.374 --> 36:12.876
Don't hide anything from me anymore...

36:12.878 --> 36:15.562
Not the truth, not the newspaper.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.380
Hand it over.

36:17.382 --> 36:19.683
- Are you sure?
- Look...

36:19.685 --> 36:23.520
I can't feel any worse
than I do now, right?

36:23.522 --> 36:26.907
Okay.

36:30.361 --> 36:34.197
You're gonna need
something stronger than tea.

36:39.403 --> 36:42.238
Hi.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.240
You're, here for the ensemble, right?

36:44.242 --> 36:47.344
That's right.

36:47.346 --> 36:49.579
You were in <i>Bombshell.</i>

36:49.581 --> 36:51.381
What a mess?

36:51.383 --> 36:53.684
Actually...

36:53.686 --> 36:56.720
It was pretty great.

38:39.958 --> 38:42.209
Hey, you done?
Bar's closing.

38:42.211 --> 38:44.828
- Sign says
you're open till 1:00.

38:44.830 --> 38:46.630
It's only quarter to.

38:46.632 --> 38:47.964
Yeah, and you've been
watching your ice melt

38:47.966 --> 38:49.533
for the past 20 minutes.

38:49.535 --> 38:51.301
While I appreciate
you actually ordered something,

38:51.303 --> 38:53.536
people got to get back
to their real lives.

38:53.538 --> 38:56.473
Yeah.
This is my real life.

38:56.475 --> 38:59.976
- Alone at a bar
at 12:45... sorry.

38:59.978 --> 39:01.878
You really don't have

39:01.880 --> 39:04.481
the "talking to customers"
thing down, do you?

39:04.483 --> 39:07.383
You want to teach me?

39:07.385 --> 39:09.719
Keep the change.

39:09.721 --> 39:14.191
I'm good.
Thanks.

39:14.193 --> 39:16.193
Is he always like that?

39:16.195 --> 39:19.863
Yeah, kind of.

39:19.865 --> 39:22.566
Hey, don't I know you?

39:22.568 --> 39:24.918
- I doubt it.
- Karen Cartwright?

39:24.920 --> 39:27.237
I saw you in <i>Bombshell.</i>

39:27.239 --> 39:28.705
You were incredible.

39:28.707 --> 39:30.573
I was so sorry to read
about what happened.

39:30.575 --> 39:33.877
Me too.
Thanks.

39:33.879 --> 39:37.464
Hey, will you do me a favor?

39:40.384 --> 39:42.102
Can you sign this for me?

39:42.104 --> 39:44.387
I know, it's really corny.

39:44.389 --> 39:46.273
But, I have this collection of programs

39:46.275 --> 39:49.092
from failed musicals...

39:49.094 --> 39:50.777
Damn, I'm sorry.
I have this thing...

39:50.779 --> 39:52.262
I just start talking before I realize

39:52.264 --> 39:53.763
that I'm talking, and then...

39:53.765 --> 39:55.899
It's okay.

39:55.901 --> 39:57.534
Ky, we got to get going.

39:59.271 --> 40:01.571
Are you two...
Are you guys, like...

40:01.573 --> 40:02.756
Us?

40:02.758 --> 40:05.408
No. God, no.

40:05.410 --> 40:08.128
I mean, he's not...

40:10.431 --> 40:11.798
But does it look like we are?

40:13.285 --> 40:15.118
You have a good night.

40:28.734 --> 40:31.401
Forgot my phone.
Sorry.

40:33.638 --> 40:35.438
You didn't see this.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.807
He's not playing the piano.
He's not supposed to.

40:37.809 --> 40:39.276
What is that he's playing?

40:39.278 --> 40:41.811
It's...

40:41.813 --> 40:44.080
Just a song he...
We wrote

40:44.082 --> 40:47.150
for... for this musical
we're working on.

40:47.152 --> 40:48.651
Cool.

40:48.653 --> 40:50.420
Look, you really got to go.
I'm sorry.

41:14.446 --> 41:15.862
Derek.

41:15.864 --> 41:17.147
Karen, it's late.
What's going on?

41:17.149 --> 41:18.365
You need to hear something.

41:18.367 --> 41:20.516
What are you talking about?

41:20.518 --> 41:22.202
Listen.

41:28.860 --> 41:31.361
Where are you?
What is that?

41:31.363 --> 41:33.029
Something else.

42:58.415 --> 43:00.784
Hello?
Excuse me.

43:00.881 --> 43:02.080
Hey.

43:02.082 --> 43:03.415
You're here.

43:03.417 --> 43:04.417
I work here.

43:04.418 --> 43:05.750
Right.

43:05.752 --> 43:07.285
I'm sorry to ambush you.

43:07.287 --> 43:09.054
I'm Karen, by the way.

43:09.056 --> 43:11.823
I left you a few messages,
but you never called back.

43:11.825 --> 43:14.826
Girls just usually call
to yell at me, so...

43:14.828 --> 43:17.145
Well, that's not
what I was calling to do.

43:17.147 --> 43:19.097
I was hoping we could talk
about your music.

43:19.099 --> 43:20.315
My what?

43:20.317 --> 43:21.632
You guys are writing a musical.

43:21.634 --> 43:22.817
I mean, I'd love to hear more.

43:22.819 --> 43:24.235
There's nothing to hear.

43:24.237 --> 43:26.404
I don't...
I don't write anything.

43:26.406 --> 43:27.989
So the song you played
last week after closing,

43:27.991 --> 43:29.474
that wasn't yours?

43:29.476 --> 43:31.142
Your friend just lied

43:31.144 --> 43:32.761
when he said it was from your musical?

43:32.763 --> 43:34.746
- Are you always like this?
- Like what?

43:34.748 --> 43:36.498
Uptight.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.316
I mean, if you stopped
clenching your jaw like that,

43:38.318 --> 43:39.834
you know, you could actually be cute.

43:39.836 --> 43:41.669
- I don't clench my jaw.
- Relax.

43:41.671 --> 43:45.340
- That's really rude.
- Okay, you're doing it again.

43:45.342 --> 43:47.592
You know, my...
My shift's over at 5:00,

43:47.594 --> 43:49.461
if you want to hang out.

43:49.463 --> 43:51.629
No, I don't...

43:51.631 --> 43:54.132
I don't want to hang out.
I just want...

43:54.134 --> 43:56.184
You know what?
Forget it.

43:56.186 --> 44:00.004
See ya.

44:00.006 --> 44:01.672
Dude, was that Karen Cartwright?

44:01.674 --> 44:03.341
No idea.

44:03.343 --> 44:04.943
She's the girl I told you about,

44:04.945 --> 44:06.344
the one that was here the other night.

44:06.346 --> 44:08.446
She's a big deal.
She could help us.

44:08.448 --> 44:10.098
We do it on our own, all right?

44:10.100 --> 44:11.849
We don't need anyone's help.

44:11.851 --> 44:14.402
Move it.
I'm late.

44:16.355 --> 44:18.790
Derek, it's me. I just
wanted to let you know

44:18.792 --> 44:20.792
I finally got in touch
with that composer.

44:20.794 --> 44:22.693
- Hey! Hey, Karen, wait up!
- It turn...

44:22.695 --> 44:26.297
And... I got
to call you back.

44:26.299 --> 44:28.699
Hey.
Hey.

44:28.701 --> 44:30.718
Look, I'm sorry about whatever
he said to you back there.

44:30.720 --> 44:31.836
That guy's your friend, right?

44:31.838 --> 44:33.371
Why, exactly?
I know.

44:33.373 --> 44:35.056
He's complicated.

44:35.058 --> 44:36.558
But he's a really good guy
when you get to know him

44:36.560 --> 44:38.176
and an amazing composer.

44:38.178 --> 44:39.978
He's just really protective
of our stuff.

44:39.980 --> 44:41.846
Well, I wanted to hear more,
play it for my friend Derek,

44:41.848 --> 44:44.182
see what he thought.
Derek, as in Derek Wills?

44:44.184 --> 44:47.218
Like... like
<i>the</i> Derek Wills? He's...

44:47.220 --> 44:49.020
Irrelevant to this conversation,

44:49.022 --> 44:50.572
since your friend
clearly isn't interested.

44:50.574 --> 44:52.073
Yes, he is.

44:52.075 --> 44:54.075
He just doesn't know it yet,
and so am I.

44:54.077 --> 44:55.860
Look, can you meet me
in a couple hours,

44:55.862 --> 44:57.362
when I'm done with my shift?

44:57.364 --> 44:59.864
There's something I want to show you.

44:59.866 --> 45:02.200
I realize your clients
haven't gotten paid, Saul.

45:02.202 --> 45:04.335
No one has.
I'm truly sorry.

45:04.337 --> 45:07.255
But mark my words, I'll have
this all ironed out,

45:07.257 --> 45:08.406
<i>tout de suite!</i>

45:08.408 --> 45:11.909
Now, if you'll excuse me...

45:13.679 --> 45:16.047
The fact I was able to stage
a single number

45:16.049 --> 45:17.715
in the middle of that circus
you and Julia created

45:17.717 --> 45:19.250
is nothing short of a miracle.

45:19.252 --> 45:21.085
"Circus"... how choice.

45:21.087 --> 45:24.755
Let's talk about you juggling
every Marilyn in the show.

45:24.757 --> 45:27.392
Boys, there's nothing to be gained

45:27.394 --> 45:29.227
by turning on each other.

45:29.229 --> 45:30.945
But it feels good.

45:30.947 --> 45:34.932
All right, then...
Maybe we should turn on you.

45:34.934 --> 45:37.735
Did it not even seem
a little bit strange to you

45:37.737 --> 45:40.238
that a Brooklyn bartender
and his funny little friends

45:40.240 --> 45:42.123
had millions of dollars
in cash lying around?

45:42.125 --> 45:44.075
I have spent the last three hours

45:44.077 --> 45:46.978
with the federal government
and my accountant,

45:46.980 --> 45:49.447
going through every bill,
receipt, and pay stub

45:49.449 --> 45:51.032
since the beginning of time.

45:51.034 --> 45:52.634
It's all in order.

45:52.636 --> 45:54.819
Did they say
when we could get back to work?

45:54.821 --> 45:57.255
No, but we're still alive.

45:57.257 --> 46:00.892
Karen is singing tonight at
the American theatre wing gala.

46:00.894 --> 46:03.294
Every Broadway bigwig will be there.

46:03.296 --> 46:05.763
So, for now, I'd like
to ask both of you

46:05.765 --> 46:08.066
please not to accept any other project

46:08.068 --> 46:09.800
until all of this is settled.

46:09.802 --> 46:11.653
Yeah, I can't make that
guarantee... I need to work.

46:11.655 --> 46:14.639
You have offers
after last week's revelations?

46:14.641 --> 46:16.257
Yeah.

46:16.259 --> 46:18.243
Rebecca Duvall has moved on,
so have the tabloids.

46:18.245 --> 46:19.911
So, beyond directing

46:19.913 --> 46:22.163
one of Broadway's
biggest stars in <i>The Wiz,</i>

46:22.165 --> 46:24.982
- yes, I have several offers.
- Amazing.

46:24.984 --> 46:26.150
What a business.

46:26.152 --> 46:27.168
Tom.

46:27.170 --> 46:28.603
Did you pack something warm

46:28.605 --> 46:30.588
for your trip to the moral high ground?

46:30.590 --> 46:32.257
Why don't you both
get out of my office?

46:32.259 --> 46:35.493
I'll let you know what happens tonight.

46:35.495 --> 46:37.762
Julia and I are here for you,
whatever you need.

46:37.764 --> 46:39.297
You are.

46:39.299 --> 46:41.666
This is the third meeting
Julia's missed.

46:41.668 --> 46:43.468
She had a college thing with Leo.

46:47.806 --> 46:50.508
It's Miriam Abramson's office
on line e... on

46:50.510 --> 46:53.511
the American theatre wing.

46:53.513 --> 46:55.446
I'm so jealous.

46:55.448 --> 46:57.348
You're going on tour
with <i>The Book of Mormon,</i>

46:57.350 --> 46:59.850
and I can't even get a callback
for an eHarmony commercial.

46:59.852 --> 47:01.686
You got to bug your agent more.

47:01.688 --> 47:03.655
Are you kidding me?
That's all I've been doing.

47:03.657 --> 47:05.323
But you are Ivy Lynn.

47:05.325 --> 47:07.208
She don't stay down for long.

47:07.210 --> 47:08.993
At least you're not Lisa McMann.

47:08.995 --> 47:10.662
Approaching, approaching.
My God, my God,

47:10.664 --> 47:12.863
my God, my God...
I cannot face that woman today.

47:12.865 --> 47:16.701
She's been plugging away
longer than I have.

47:16.703 --> 47:19.370
Ivy? And Sam?

47:19.372 --> 47:21.506
- My God!
- Lisa McMann!

47:21.508 --> 47:23.141
Hi!

47:23.143 --> 47:24.559
This is too funny!

47:24.561 --> 47:26.711
I was just thinking about you guys

47:26.713 --> 47:28.146
and that awful Shakespeare festival

47:28.148 --> 47:29.880
we did in the adirondacks.

47:29.882 --> 47:32.400
Don't remind me.

47:32.402 --> 47:35.219
So what have you been up to?

47:35.221 --> 47:37.238
Stationery!

47:37.240 --> 47:38.856
Yeah!

47:38.858 --> 47:42.193
I got out of the biz,
and my whole life changed.

47:42.195 --> 47:44.061
Now I make my own hours.

47:44.063 --> 47:45.530
People actually want
what I'm offering...

47:45.532 --> 47:47.415
No more rejection,
rejection, rejection.

47:47.417 --> 47:50.401
Here is my guesthouse.

47:50.403 --> 47:52.370
Yeah.

47:52.372 --> 47:54.589
How about you guys?

47:58.043 --> 47:59.744
Hello, darling.

47:59.746 --> 48:01.879
How's my second favorite
agent in the world?

48:01.881 --> 48:03.881
Very sweet.

48:03.883 --> 48:05.082
Loving the purple.

48:05.084 --> 48:06.551
- Thank you.
- So...

48:06.553 --> 48:07.885
Got some news for me?

48:07.887 --> 48:09.587
What's happening with <i>The Wiz?</i>

48:09.589 --> 48:11.756
Well, Ronnie's a big fan, as you know,

48:11.758 --> 48:13.591
and she remains that way.

48:13.593 --> 48:16.394
She fought hard for you
with the producers.

48:16.396 --> 48:17.729
Wait.

48:17.731 --> 48:20.515
Am I hearing a past tense in there?

48:20.517 --> 48:22.099
They're letting you go.

48:22.101 --> 48:24.435
Just because I shagged
a couple of actresses?

48:24.437 --> 48:25.903
That's ludicrous.

48:25.905 --> 48:28.039
Well, it's not just because of that.

48:28.041 --> 48:29.940
The local news has a story.

48:29.942 --> 48:31.576
We got the heads-up
an hour ago.

48:31.578 --> 48:34.612
Five dancers have come forward

48:34.614 --> 48:37.448
and are accusing you
of sexual harassment.

48:37.450 --> 48:39.801
I have the names here somewhere.

48:41.388 --> 48:43.621
I don't want to talk
to her assistant again.

48:43.623 --> 48:46.257
I want to talk to her.

48:47.593 --> 48:49.811
Looks nothing like you.

48:49.813 --> 48:52.397
I knew I should have moved offices.

48:52.399 --> 48:55.483
Jerry...

48:55.485 --> 48:58.403
I'm in a particularly tight spot,

48:58.405 --> 48:59.604
and you owe me.

48:59.606 --> 49:01.122
- I do?
- Yes.

49:01.124 --> 49:02.940
You're giving me your table tonight

49:02.942 --> 49:04.659
for the American theatre wing gala.

49:04.661 --> 49:06.477
I thought you were already going.

49:06.479 --> 49:08.279
I thought I was too.

49:08.281 --> 49:11.132
But Miriam Abramson's
assistant called to say

49:11.134 --> 49:12.950
that I am no longer on the guest list.

49:12.952 --> 49:14.969
Is that so?

49:14.971 --> 49:18.172
I have only a small window
of opportunity for <i>Bombshell,</i>

49:18.174 --> 49:20.007
and I will not have it closed.

49:20.009 --> 49:22.510
I refuse to be treated like a criminal.

49:22.512 --> 49:24.762
So...

49:24.764 --> 49:26.848
You want to be my date?

49:26.850 --> 49:28.666
No.
You're not going.

49:28.668 --> 49:30.852
It'll be just me and my creative team.

49:30.854 --> 49:33.604
I hear Julia's a mess.

49:33.606 --> 49:36.023
<i>The Wiz</i> dropped Derek
like a hot potato.

49:36.025 --> 49:39.794
Julia's fine.
And so is Derek.

49:39.796 --> 49:42.363
My team couldn't be more unified.

49:42.365 --> 49:45.149
They'll sail through.

49:45.151 --> 49:47.852
You're welcome.

49:54.794 --> 49:56.210
Hello?

49:56.212 --> 49:57.545
Hi, boys.

49:57.547 --> 49:59.664
I need Julia too.
Is she there?

49:59.666 --> 50:02.800
She's meeting with her realtor.

50:02.802 --> 50:04.034
What's going on, Eileen?

50:04.036 --> 50:05.636
I'm on my way home.

50:05.638 --> 50:07.388
Okay, we've got
a slight change of plans.

50:07.390 --> 50:09.707
Karen's no longer singing tonight.

50:09.709 --> 50:11.559
Instead, it'll be the four of us,

50:11.561 --> 50:13.177
8:00 at the Plaza,

50:13.179 --> 50:15.680
and I want you on
your best behavior, all of you...

50:15.682 --> 50:18.716
No fighting, no surprises, no scandals.

50:18.718 --> 50:19.734
Is that understood?

50:19.736 --> 50:21.903
Bloody paparazzo.

50:21.905 --> 50:23.521
Of course.

50:23.523 --> 50:26.357
And, Tom, tell Julia
it's cocktail attire.

50:26.359 --> 50:28.075
Yep.

50:28.077 --> 50:29.577
No!

50:36.883 --> 50:38.584
No, I can't, not tonight.

50:38.671 --> 50:40.038
I'm not up for it, maybe tomorrow.

50:40.805 --> 50:42.738
You have to.
Eileen needs us.

50:42.740 --> 50:44.323
Besides, it's been a week.

50:44.325 --> 50:46.075
You're starting to merge
with the couch.

50:46.077 --> 50:47.643
Some air will be good for you.

50:47.645 --> 50:51.263
I got some air today.
I met Leo in Riverside Park.

50:51.265 --> 50:54.266
And then you came home
and put your pajamas back on?

50:54.268 --> 50:56.802
I may have met him in them.

50:56.804 --> 50:58.621
Julia!

50:58.623 --> 51:00.506
Look, it's...
It's bad enough

51:00.508 --> 51:02.425
that I destroyed my family.

51:02.427 --> 51:05.628
Now Frank is telling people,
and everyone is writing me.

51:05.630 --> 51:08.631
I have to relive the whole thing
every time I check my email!

51:08.633 --> 51:11.667
I know it's hard,
but we can't abandon <i>Bombshell</i>

51:11.669 --> 51:13.335
in her hour of need.

51:13.337 --> 51:15.671
None of your relatives are gonna
be at the thing tonight.

51:15.673 --> 51:17.456
No, just industry people...
That's worse.

51:17.458 --> 51:18.774
They'll eat me alive.

51:18.776 --> 51:20.192
Look, if there was anywhere else

51:20.194 --> 51:21.944
that you wanted me to go
with you tonight...

51:21.946 --> 51:25.180
The Bronx zoo, whole foods...
The shower?

51:28.852 --> 51:31.954
I am asking my friend Tom

51:31.956 --> 51:34.523
to tell my partner Tom

51:34.525 --> 51:37.510
that I need the night off.

51:37.512 --> 51:39.662
Please?

51:39.664 --> 51:41.797
I will tell Eileen you're sick

51:41.799 --> 51:44.633
and represent the team myself.

51:44.635 --> 51:47.703
Thank you.
You're the best.

51:47.705 --> 51:49.555
Yes, I am.

51:49.557 --> 51:52.975
And I promise, I'll get back up soon.

51:52.977 --> 51:56.278
Just a...
Just a little longer?

51:59.850 --> 52:02.818
This is... this is what
you wanted to show me?

52:02.820 --> 52:04.553
He doesn't write anything down, really,

52:04.555 --> 52:07.890
except, occasionally, when he's wasted.

52:07.892 --> 52:10.192
This one is particularly amazing.

52:10.194 --> 52:11.660
He doesn't know I saved it.
Read the lyrics.

52:11.662 --> 52:13.496
I think they start
on the cocktail menu.

52:13.498 --> 52:15.998
I don't understand... do you
guys have a musical or not?

52:16.000 --> 52:18.534
We do.
We're still working on it,

52:18.536 --> 52:20.036
but most of the songs are written.

52:20.038 --> 52:23.422
Does your friend even know you're here?

52:23.424 --> 52:25.875
Look...

52:25.877 --> 52:27.910
I just came from a clearasil audition

52:27.912 --> 52:30.079
and then found out the one thing
I was looking forward to

52:30.081 --> 52:31.931
got canceled tonight,
so you can understand

52:31.933 --> 52:34.266
I was hoping to get involved
with something that's real.

52:34.268 --> 52:36.585
This obviously isn't it.

52:36.587 --> 52:38.387
Let me know if it ever
comes together, okay?

52:38.389 --> 52:41.090
Find someone to play this for you.

52:41.092 --> 52:44.226
And if you like it
or you want to hear more,

52:44.228 --> 52:47.897
come to our place tonight...
We're having some people over.

52:47.899 --> 52:50.950
Maybe if you stop by and got
to know Jimmy a little better,

52:50.952 --> 52:55.371
he'd let his guard down,
play you some stuff.

52:55.373 --> 52:57.740
Think about it?

53:08.119 --> 53:09.969
You can just...

53:09.971 --> 53:12.221
Leave it at the door, whatever it is!

53:12.223 --> 53:13.756
Thank you!

53:13.758 --> 53:15.758
Julia?

53:15.760 --> 53:18.260
It's Ivy.

53:22.649 --> 53:25.317
Hello, Daisy.
Can I have a word?

53:25.319 --> 53:27.987
- I can't talk to you, Derek.
- Yeah, you can.

53:27.989 --> 53:30.305
We need to have a little chat
about your understanding

53:30.307 --> 53:32.408
of the phrase
"sexual harassment."

53:32.410 --> 53:33.943
You know I never touched you.

53:33.945 --> 53:35.744
I didn't say you did.

53:35.746 --> 53:38.614
You only hit on me through
four callbacks of <i>Sweet charity,</i>

53:38.616 --> 53:40.749
and when I finally said
I wouldn't sleep with you,

53:40.751 --> 53:42.451
I mysteriously lost out on the job.

53:42.453 --> 53:44.286
Well, as I recall,
you didn't get the job

53:44.288 --> 53:45.821
'cause, while you were
a pretty good dancer,

53:45.823 --> 53:47.623
you were only an okay actress,
which is why,

53:47.625 --> 53:51.927
after all these years,
you're still teaching pilates.

53:51.929 --> 53:53.762
You're unbelievable.

53:53.764 --> 53:55.431
Is that really
what you came here to say?

53:55.433 --> 53:57.199
Yeah, pretty much.

53:57.201 --> 54:00.436
Since when is it harassment
to ask someone out on a date?

54:00.438 --> 54:01.837
You don't get it.

54:01.839 --> 54:03.606
You're a big-shot director.

54:03.608 --> 54:05.007
You're in a position of power

54:05.009 --> 54:07.009
from the minute
you wake up in the morning,

54:07.011 --> 54:08.861
and you don't treat
that power with respect.

54:08.863 --> 54:11.614
Or did you really think women say yes

54:11.616 --> 54:15.067
because they actually like you?

54:18.371 --> 54:21.223
I'm sorry. I thought
I was gonna be venting to Tom.

54:21.225 --> 54:22.992
Are you sure this is okay?

54:22.994 --> 54:26.061
Of course, I'm thrilled
to be of use to anyone.

54:26.063 --> 54:29.231
I know you guys
are super successful now.

54:29.233 --> 54:32.117
But did you ever feel like giving up?

54:32.119 --> 54:35.554
I could barely get up
to answer the door.

54:37.391 --> 54:39.708
I just don't know what to do.

54:39.710 --> 54:41.977
Now I'm going in for parts
that I would have passed on

54:41.979 --> 54:43.979
two years ago.

54:43.981 --> 54:45.731
Maybe I should just quit.

54:45.733 --> 54:48.550
I've been where you are.

54:48.552 --> 54:50.236
It's a brutal business.

54:50.238 --> 54:52.354
But just when I'd want
to throw in the towel,

54:52.356 --> 54:54.823
something would happen to remind me

54:54.825 --> 54:57.860
of why I love it in the first place.

54:57.862 --> 55:01.497
And thus, the dysfunctional
cycle continues.

55:04.502 --> 55:06.669
Yeah.

55:06.671 --> 55:09.038
- It cures everything.
- It really does.

55:11.008 --> 55:12.708
I see...
Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom!

55:12.710 --> 55:14.260
Listen, I've been meaning to call you.

55:14.262 --> 55:15.511
Honey, I've been so worried.

55:15.513 --> 55:17.429
You are... why?

55:17.431 --> 55:19.265
If they said half the stuff
about a show of mine

55:19.267 --> 55:20.933
they're saying about yours,
I would be on suicide watch.

55:20.935 --> 55:23.018
Well, you know our business.

55:23.020 --> 55:25.721
So much is exaggerated
or just plain made up.

55:25.723 --> 55:27.223
Hey, you think I believe half of it?

55:27.225 --> 55:29.058
But I mean, come on, it's absurd.

55:29.060 --> 55:30.559
I mean, even Derek couldn't be

55:30.561 --> 55:32.094
as much of a dog as they're saying.

55:32.096 --> 55:33.946
You know, that's the kind
of thing that...

55:33.948 --> 55:35.898
And Eileen rand running
around with a drug lord?

55:35.900 --> 55:37.283
- Well, honestly...
- Wait.

55:37.285 --> 55:39.034
I really don't know the specifics.

55:39.036 --> 55:41.403
Please do not thank me,
but I have ordered everyone

55:41.405 --> 55:44.240
to stop talking about Julia
having a nervous breakdown.

55:44.242 --> 55:45.908
Well, thank you anyway for that.

55:45.910 --> 55:47.609
But she's doing fine.

55:47.611 --> 55:50.045
The split was amicable.

55:50.047 --> 55:52.781
Well, you mean it's true?
You know what?

55:52.783 --> 55:54.717
You have nothing to worry about.

55:54.719 --> 55:56.051
You are too good... someone's
gonna snatch you right up.

55:56.053 --> 55:57.286
In fact, I have this idea that...

55:57.288 --> 55:58.887
What?
No, no, no, no, no.

55:58.889 --> 56:00.306
J-Julia and I haven't
broken up.

56:00.308 --> 56:01.640
I was talking about...
No, we're fine.

56:01.642 --> 56:03.092
Harvey, look at me.

56:03.094 --> 56:04.476
Julia's fine.
We are still together.

56:04.478 --> 56:06.929
So I guess I will see you both tonight

56:06.931 --> 56:08.981
at that theatre wingding thing?

56:08.983 --> 56:12.801
Yes?
The two of you, together?

56:12.803 --> 56:14.236
Yes, you will.

56:14.238 --> 56:15.971
Julia will not only be there with me,

56:15.973 --> 56:18.157
but...

56:18.159 --> 56:20.409
We're giving a speech...

56:20.411 --> 56:22.644
A tribute, as a team...

56:22.646 --> 56:24.913
Both of us, together.

56:24.915 --> 56:28.317
And I will be right there
cheering you on, as always.

56:28.319 --> 56:29.618
All right, later.

56:29.620 --> 56:31.870
Bye. Bye.

56:34.457 --> 56:37.626
So it's up to six dancers now?

56:37.628 --> 56:39.995
Well, thank you
for telling me that, Peggy.

56:39.997 --> 56:42.014
Clearly, you're taking
no delight whatsoever

56:42.016 --> 56:45.351
- in my misfortune.
- Derek on two.

56:45.353 --> 56:47.603
Bye, Peggy.

56:47.605 --> 56:50.505
Did you not hear a word
I said to you this morning?

56:50.507 --> 56:52.691
I didn't do anything.

56:52.693 --> 56:55.311
You did a lot. It's just
catching up with you now.

56:55.313 --> 56:56.678
Yeah, whatever.

56:56.680 --> 56:58.947
What time is this thing again tonight?

56:58.949 --> 57:00.115
You're not coming.

57:00.117 --> 57:03.754
<i>Bombshell</i> needs ambassadors,
not another liability.

57:03.780 --> 57:04.803
I'm sorry.

57:04.805 --> 57:06.522
Well, Julia the adulteress
is now Ambassador,

57:06.524 --> 57:08.707
but the serial seducer isn't?

57:08.709 --> 57:10.793
Is this a gender thing?

57:10.795 --> 57:13.329
You know what?
I'm hanging up now, Derek.

57:13.331 --> 57:15.331
You're not going to
'cause I'm gonna hang up first!

57:20.054 --> 57:23.839
Another one of these.

57:23.841 --> 57:26.392
I have a question for you, young mate.

57:27.978 --> 57:30.896
If you have something somebody wants,

57:30.898 --> 57:33.148
does that mean you
can't sleep with them?

57:33.150 --> 57:36.218
Dude, I don't know.
My shift's over.

57:36.220 --> 57:37.903
Dan, he's all yours.

57:37.905 --> 57:40.689
Come on.

57:40.691 --> 57:43.025
All women like me.

57:51.418 --> 57:53.419
Hello.

57:53.421 --> 57:56.405
You're not a dancer,
by any chance, are you?

57:56.407 --> 57:58.240
Back off, dude.

57:58.242 --> 58:01.343
She's with me.

58:01.345 --> 58:05.264
I think the lady can speak for herself.

59:58.625 --> 01:00:00.781
Honey, I'm home.

01:00:00.963 --> 01:00:02.664
Listen...

01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:04.850
I may have done something.

01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:06.000
I know.

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.853
- I heard.
- You heard?

01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:10.171
Mary Testa just called.

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:12.607
She said that she heard
from Jackie Hoffman,

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.309
who heard from Cheyenne Jackson,

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:17.195
who heard from Harvey fierstein

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:19.180
that we're presenting tonight?

01:00:19.182 --> 01:00:21.817
- Yes. Well...
- You could have told me.

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:23.535
That's important!

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:26.020
I only said no because
I didn't want to sit at a table

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:27.789
and be silently judged all night.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.324
I can't say no

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:33.045
to the entire American theatre wing.

01:00:33.047 --> 01:00:35.530
How did this happen?

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:37.699
Okay.

01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:40.034
First of all, you can stand.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.870
Good to know.
Tell me!

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:45.039
Well, I got a call out of the blue...

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:47.059
From the head

01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:49.678
of the theatre wing...
I forget her name.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.313
Miriam Abramson.
I've met her.

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:52.714
Right, of course you have.

01:00:52.716 --> 01:00:55.984
Well, apparently Miriam needed someone

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:58.386
to speak about the theatre wing

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.689
and all the beatific stuff it does,

01:01:00.691 --> 01:01:02.056
and when they heard we were coming,

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:05.911
they thought, who better than us?

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:08.246
That is so nice...

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.916
The community supporting us

01:01:10.918 --> 01:01:13.535
after everything
we've just been through.

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:16.738
What do you want to say?

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.373
Do you want me to just
take a stab at it?

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:20.008
I've already jotted down
a few thoughts.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.927
- A few?
- My God. My God!

01:01:21.929 --> 01:01:23.879
I've got to do my hair.
Here, you take over

01:01:23.881 --> 01:01:26.080
you're actually excited about this.

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:28.517
Excited? No.
But I can do this.

01:01:28.519 --> 01:01:30.385
You're my partner,
and I'm not gonna let you

01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:32.053
stand up there alone.

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.922
And try and keep it brief.

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:35.774
I hate it when presenters run on.

01:01:35.776 --> 01:01:39.194
Giving notes already
before I've even started...

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.946
Julia's back!

01:01:49.957 --> 01:01:51.907
Or something like that.

01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:53.758
He's crazy good.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.627
- Like Jonathan Larson good
- Yes.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.445
Maybe they're writing the next <i>rent.</i>

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:58.914
I know.
It's amazing.

01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:01.115
I'm not crazy for stalking
this guy, right?

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:02.551
Honey, I'm ready to stalk him.

01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:04.118
Is he straight?
He can't be straight.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.954
I mean, it's musical theater.

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:07.622
It doesn't matter if he is or he isn't.

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:09.457
He's not interested in me...
He called me "uptight."

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:11.560
Okay, I say this with love,

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:13.762
but you did sound
a little uptight just now.

01:02:13.764 --> 01:02:16.231
You guys, just give her a break.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.566
She's just out
of a three-year relationship,

01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:19.434
and she's a little bit rusty.

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:21.236
She doesn't realize
when a guy is hitting on her.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:22.737
You guys are missing the point.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.439
All I want to do is hear
the rest of his songs.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:25.957
I just have to figure out how.

01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:28.109
I can think of one way.

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:29.978
I knew you were gonna say that.

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:40.121
Okay, you're definitely not
writing the next <i>Rent.</i>

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:41.155
Please.

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:44.292
No, she isn't.

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:47.796
But she just gave me a better idea.

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:49.764
Thanks for checking in.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.600
Yeah, well, don't go pulling
a Lisa McMann on me

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:52.934
while I'm on tour, okay?

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.669
Well, maybe she's got the right idea.

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:56.471
She gave it her all,

01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:59.307
and when it didn't pan out,
she exited stage left,

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:01.443
and now she's
the happiest person we know.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:03.511
What would you do
if you couldn't do this?

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:05.947
See, you don't have an easy answer.

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:08.516
I gotta call you back.

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.351
Good evening.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:18.543
Hi, there.

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:19.861
Sorry to intrude.

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:23.715
Miriam, lovely to see you.

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:25.550
I was really so touched

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:27.836
that you thought of us for this honor,

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:29.804
especially in light of recent events.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:33.341
- I'm sorry. What?
- God.

01:03:33.343 --> 01:03:34.893
I was just wondering if you knew

01:03:34.895 --> 01:03:37.479
when in the program
that we'd be speaking.

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.731
I get a little stage fright sometimes.

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:41.816
But if I know when it's coming, then...

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:45.320
- I don't... I-I'm sorry...
- Okay, pardon me, hi, hi.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:49.324
Someone asked you to speak tonight?

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:50.825
You did.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:55.413
You asked Tom...

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:57.249
Levitt?

01:03:57.251 --> 01:03:59.751
No, I'm quite certain I didn't

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:01.086
and wouldn't either.

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:02.754
Hi. Hi. Hi.

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:04.906
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:08.260
No, I'm sorry.

01:04:08.262 --> 01:04:11.212
And you're gonna be.

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:14.215
Miriam. Excuse me.

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.387
Julia.

01:04:19.389 --> 01:04:21.089
Julia?

01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:23.692
Can you please stay,
so we can talk about this?

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:26.928
I had a million reasons
to be embarrassed

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:28.697
before I came here tonight,

01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:30.765
and you just created a new one.

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:33.568
I got caught in a moment,
and it got away from me.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.120
I was gonna tell you the truth.

01:04:35.122 --> 01:04:38.239
But when you heard about this,
you were so happy,

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:40.125
for the first time in weeks.

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:42.577
It got you off the couch.
That doesn't make it okay!

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:44.079
Excuse me.

01:04:44.081 --> 01:04:45.914
I have to tell you,

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.633
I just saw <i>heaven on Earth</i>
<i>again for the third time.</i>

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:50.635
- Wonderful.
- I'm so glad.

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:52.453
The new Fella's not so good.

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:54.288
- Great.
- Helpful.

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:56.641
Julia...

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:57.976
Look...

01:04:57.978 --> 01:05:00.095
I'm really worried about you.

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:02.130
I feel awful about everything
that you're going through

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:04.649
with Frank and Leo, but it is very hard

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:07.769
to watch you be this down for so long.

01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:08.970
Well, I'm sorry.

01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:11.139
Maybe you'd bounce back faster,

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:12.440
but we're different people,

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:14.242
and I need to do this on my own time.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:16.477
But it's not just your time.
It's mine too.

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:18.947
As partners, if you're down
for the count, then so am I.

01:05:18.949 --> 01:05:22.316
Is that what this is about?
I'm holding you down?

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:26.655
No.
You're doing it again.

01:05:26.657 --> 01:05:28.923
You're hiding something.
Talk to me.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.325
I'm not made of glass.

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.995
Fine.

01:05:33.997 --> 01:05:36.014
Word on the street is that
you couldn't hack it

01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:38.266
on <i>Bombshell,</i>

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:40.101
that you had a nervous breakdown,

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.003
and that I should be looking
for another writing partner

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:45.440
before my career goes down with yours.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:47.692
You keep promising
you'll come out of it,

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:51.196
but then you find another reason
to crawl back onto the couch.

01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:55.700
I am running out of excuses for you.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:00.855
I don't want a new
writing partner, okay?

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:03.858
I just want my old one back.

01:06:16.165 --> 01:06:18.031
So this is greenpoint.

01:06:18.033 --> 01:06:20.033
Half pierogies and half poseurs...

01:06:20.035 --> 01:06:21.552
What's not to love?

01:06:21.554 --> 01:06:22.869
So where is this guy?

01:06:22.871 --> 01:06:24.555
I'm looking.
I'm looking.

01:06:24.557 --> 01:06:26.707
I'm gonna get me some moonshine...

01:06:26.709 --> 01:06:29.727
Or that.

01:06:29.729 --> 01:06:32.813
- That's Kyle. Don't you dare.
- Too late.

01:06:32.815 --> 01:06:34.898
There he is, in the red flannel.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.017
Okay, I'll admit

01:06:37.019 --> 01:06:39.903
that's worth getting
on the "G" train for.

01:06:39.905 --> 01:06:41.655
What are you waiting for?
Go say hi.

01:06:41.657 --> 01:06:43.357
- Okay.
- Go.

01:06:43.359 --> 01:06:46.076
Don't be uptight!

01:06:46.078 --> 01:06:48.862
Hey.

01:06:48.864 --> 01:06:50.063
Nice place.

01:06:50.065 --> 01:06:51.832
Thanks.

01:06:51.834 --> 01:06:53.500
Nice shoe.

01:06:57.072 --> 01:06:58.238
It's sticky.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.906
Kyle said he invited you.

01:06:59.908 --> 01:07:02.543
I said you didn't know
where Brooklyn was.

01:07:02.545 --> 01:07:04.878
I hate to rock your world.
I used to live in Brooklyn.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.913
You are rocking my world.

01:07:06.915 --> 01:07:10.718
My first apartment
was in Fort Greene, FYI.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.085
Did it ever occur to you

01:07:12.087 --> 01:07:14.421
I might be a little cooler
than you think?

01:07:14.423 --> 01:07:17.357
Well, you just said "FYI," so, no.

01:07:19.111 --> 01:07:23.096
So what does a girl got to do
to get a drink around here?

01:07:24.867 --> 01:07:26.617
Ky, we need some more brew!

01:07:28.937 --> 01:07:30.604
That.

01:07:30.606 --> 01:07:33.273
You can have mine for now.

01:07:33.275 --> 01:07:35.209
Thanks.

01:07:35.211 --> 01:07:36.794
Okay, what is going on with you?

01:07:36.796 --> 01:07:41.698
God, haven't you heard?

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:45.235
Well, picture
a whole line of rockettes...

01:07:45.237 --> 01:07:49.106
A big pile of girls,
all telling lies about me.

01:07:50.725 --> 01:07:54.561
You know what I'm like.
I'm not that bad.

01:07:54.563 --> 01:07:57.097
Come on!

01:07:58.817 --> 01:08:00.934
Look...

01:08:03.104 --> 01:08:06.740
I know it was a big mess
at the end, and...

01:08:06.742 --> 01:08:10.244
I was a complete ass, all right?

01:08:10.246 --> 01:08:14.782
But I'm not a monster, am I?

01:08:14.784 --> 01:08:18.402
Why do you care
what I think all of a sudden?

01:08:18.404 --> 01:08:20.770
Shouldn't you be asking Karen?

01:08:20.773 --> 01:08:22.171
Isn't she your muse?

01:08:22.174 --> 01:08:24.658
Maybe.
Whatever.

01:08:27.962 --> 01:08:31.298
You're my friend.

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.152
All right, you were my friend.

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:39.439
I was a lot of things, Derek.

01:08:39.441 --> 01:08:42.109
But now I don't know what I am anymore.

01:08:42.111 --> 01:08:45.011
Or if I even want to stay
in this business.

01:08:45.013 --> 01:08:47.331
You're far too good to pack
it in... don't be so stupid.

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:49.149
I couldn't have been that good.

01:08:49.151 --> 01:08:51.033
I wasn't Marilyn.
You were my Marilyn.

01:08:51.036 --> 01:08:52.953
What do I know?

01:08:52.955 --> 01:08:54.354
I made a million stupid mistakes.

01:08:54.356 --> 01:08:56.840
Just prove me wrong.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:59.376
You are a singular talent.

01:09:02.529 --> 01:09:04.865
Don't give up.

01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:12.923
I don't think you're a monster.

01:09:17.879 --> 01:09:19.395
Nope, not gonna happen.

01:09:19.398 --> 01:09:21.214
Right.

01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:30.157
Miriam...

01:09:30.158 --> 01:09:31.658
How great to see you.

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:33.694
What a night.
Everybody's here.

01:09:33.696 --> 01:09:35.228
Eileen, I was told

01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:37.080
you wouldn't be joining us
this evening.

01:09:37.082 --> 01:09:38.832
Well, you were told wrong.

01:09:38.834 --> 01:09:40.701
I wouldn't dream of missing this.

01:09:40.703 --> 01:09:43.703
After all, what's more important
to me than our community?

01:09:43.706 --> 01:09:48.207
I would think, at this moment,
your legal troubles.

01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:52.546
Miriam, you and I have
a long history together.

01:09:52.548 --> 01:09:55.716
Surely you know
I'm a woman of integrity.

01:09:55.718 --> 01:09:58.101
I have an organization to protect.

01:09:58.103 --> 01:09:59.720
In these economic times,

01:09:59.722 --> 01:10:02.055
we can't afford even
a whiff of impropriety.

01:10:02.057 --> 01:10:04.725
So I trust you'll understand
why I have to ask you

01:10:04.727 --> 01:10:06.894
and your team to leave.

01:10:06.896 --> 01:10:09.196
I should have known
they were here with you.

01:10:09.198 --> 01:10:11.365
I'm so sorry no one in New York
will get to see

01:10:11.367 --> 01:10:14.100
what you lost everything for.

01:10:14.102 --> 01:10:16.403
Best wishes to you.

01:10:16.405 --> 01:10:19.272
Yes.

01:10:20.608 --> 01:10:23.961
Yeah, yeah, I liked the strokes too,

01:10:23.963 --> 01:10:26.613
when I was 15.

01:10:26.615 --> 01:10:27.881
You know what you are?

01:10:27.883 --> 01:10:28.982
A snob.
Me?

01:10:28.984 --> 01:10:30.884
- Yeah.
- I'm a snob?

01:10:30.886 --> 01:10:31.969
Uhhuh.

01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:33.403
At least I'm not uptight.

01:10:33.405 --> 01:10:34.988
No, no, don't change the subject.

01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:36.890
You heard me, snob.

01:10:36.892 --> 01:10:38.976
Deal with it.

01:10:38.978 --> 01:10:41.929
So is that the piano you don't play?

01:10:41.931 --> 01:10:44.615
Yeah, I play a little...
Whatever...

01:10:44.617 --> 01:10:46.433
When I'm in the mood.

01:10:46.435 --> 01:10:48.936
Well, I sing a little
when I'm in the mood.

01:10:48.938 --> 01:10:52.305
I'll bet you do.

01:10:52.307 --> 01:10:55.976
So how will I know
if you're in the mood.

01:10:55.978 --> 01:10:58.929
Well...
It'll be very obvious.

01:10:58.931 --> 01:11:02.449
I might, like, look around and...

01:11:02.451 --> 01:11:04.484
Figure out what the vibe is.

01:11:04.486 --> 01:11:05.953
Okay.

01:11:05.955 --> 01:11:07.838
And then I might just...

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.090
Stand up...

01:11:10.092 --> 01:11:12.459
And stretch...

01:11:12.461 --> 01:11:14.962
Warm up a bit.
I think I get the picture.

01:11:14.964 --> 01:11:17.464
And then I...
I might just finish my drink.

01:11:17.466 --> 01:11:19.499
Oops, already did...

01:11:19.501 --> 01:11:21.518
Kind of.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.602
Oop.

01:11:24.606 --> 01:11:26.990
And, probably just...

01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:29.443
Sing a song.

01:12:49.891 --> 01:12:52.225
You son of a bitch.

01:13:06.977 --> 01:13:08.779
Hold up a second!

01:13:08.781 --> 01:13:10.914
- You stole my songs?
- What? No.

01:13:10.916 --> 01:13:12.833
- I should kick your ass.
- Would you calm down?

01:13:12.835 --> 01:13:14.768
I just showed her one... I had
no idea she was gonna do that.

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:16.620
I.. I'm so sorry.

01:13:16.622 --> 01:13:18.789
I didn't think you'd get so mad.

01:13:18.791 --> 01:13:20.257
Stay out of this, princess.

01:13:20.259 --> 01:13:21.625
My God.

01:13:21.627 --> 01:13:23.426
I-I just think you're
really talented.

01:13:23.428 --> 01:13:24.828
I want to help.

01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:26.830
I don't need your help, all right?

01:13:26.832 --> 01:13:28.331
I-I write for myself.

01:13:28.333 --> 01:13:29.850
You want to go write
your own musical? Great.

01:13:29.852 --> 01:13:31.418
Go ahead.
Leave mine alone.

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:32.936
It's not just yours!

01:13:32.938 --> 01:13:34.170
Yeah, says the guy who sits there

01:13:34.172 --> 01:13:35.355
and watches me write the songs.

01:13:35.357 --> 01:13:38.341
Hey... your music
is really good.

01:13:38.343 --> 01:13:40.193
I know it's scary
to put yourself out there,

01:13:40.195 --> 01:13:41.678
but you have to... otherwise,
you're never gonna know

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.979
how good you are.

01:13:42.981 --> 01:13:43.981
Yeah.

01:13:43.982 --> 01:13:45.699
Well, unlike you,

01:13:45.701 --> 01:13:47.183
I don't need other people
to tell me I'm good.

01:13:47.185 --> 01:13:48.618
I know I'm good.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:50.470
- I know I'm good too.
- Yeah?

01:13:50.472 --> 01:13:53.623
Then why aren't you out there
onstage, in the city,

01:13:53.625 --> 01:13:55.325
taking your curtain call,
instead of out here,

01:13:55.327 --> 01:13:58.528
begging two strangers for a song
to help you get there!

01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:00.831
You know, I think you should
just take your friends and go.

01:14:00.833 --> 01:14:04.200
Don't worry.
We're going.

01:14:12.994 --> 01:14:16.313
Well, we came, we saw, we got shunned.

01:14:16.315 --> 01:14:18.515
I say we go.
We're going...

01:14:18.517 --> 01:14:21.184
But not until we do something
very important.

01:14:21.186 --> 01:14:22.819
What's going on?

01:14:22.821 --> 01:14:24.521
I want to help.

01:14:24.523 --> 01:14:25.989
Good.

01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:27.741
I want the world
to see what it would miss

01:14:27.743 --> 01:14:29.058
if <i>Bombshel</i> went away.

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.827
And how do we do that?

01:14:30.829 --> 01:14:33.547
We put on a performance
they'll never forget.

01:14:33.549 --> 01:14:35.699
I like it.
Calling Karen?

01:14:35.701 --> 01:14:36.833
On it.

01:14:36.835 --> 01:14:38.418
Straight to voice mail.

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:39.436
What do we do now?

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.341
Hi. Sorry.
I came as fast as I could.

01:14:44.343 --> 01:14:45.926
No, please, Ivy.

01:14:45.928 --> 01:14:47.761
We're just so grateful to you
for doing this.

01:14:47.763 --> 01:14:50.597
Hey, I'm just excited someone
still wants to hear me sing.

01:14:50.599 --> 01:14:52.349
I realize you didn't want me here,

01:14:52.351 --> 01:14:54.551
but here I am.
Please.

01:14:54.553 --> 01:14:57.437
None of us are supposed to be here.

01:14:58.690 --> 01:15:01.224
Hello. Hi.

01:15:01.226 --> 01:15:02.859
I'm Julia Houston.

01:15:02.861 --> 01:15:06.696
Just wanted to make
a little impromptu tribute

01:15:06.698 --> 01:15:11.067
to Miriam Abramson for pulling
off this incredible night.

01:15:11.069 --> 01:15:12.953
Right?

01:15:19.443 --> 01:15:22.445
I am happy to introduce...

01:15:22.447 --> 01:15:24.948
Ivy Lynn...

01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:27.550
One of Broadway's future stars,

01:15:27.552 --> 01:15:29.386
who will be singing one of our songs

01:15:29.388 --> 01:15:33.807
from <i>Bombshell, coming to Broadway...</i>

01:15:33.809 --> 01:15:35.258
This season.

01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.093
Yeah.

01:18:43.414 --> 01:18:45.982
Now I'm ready to go.

01:18:54.017 --> 01:18:56.602
How *** made an impresion last night?

01:18:56.763 --> 01:18:58.379
More than you know.

01:18:58.381 --> 01:19:00.748
Turns out the U.S. attorney's
wife was there.

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:03.718
How about that?
What a happy coincidence.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.421
Yes, and it seems that
we're allowed to resume work

01:19:06.423 --> 01:19:08.723
on the show, just so long
as it's not for profit

01:19:08.725 --> 01:19:10.959
or public consumption.

01:19:10.961 --> 01:19:13.794
But how can you resume work on the show

01:19:13.796 --> 01:19:17.265
if you don't have the money
to pay anyone?

01:19:20.403 --> 01:19:22.420
How much do you need?

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.943
I'll have my lawyer draw up a contract.

01:19:28.945 --> 01:19:32.613
I don't want to owe you
anything but money.

01:19:32.615 --> 01:19:33.948
Wonderful.

01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:37.085
Dude...

01:19:37.087 --> 01:19:39.754
Yo!

01:19:39.756 --> 01:19:41.289
All right, cut the cold shoulder.

01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:42.674
Just spit it out.

01:19:42.676 --> 01:19:44.509
You know what I'm upset about.

01:19:44.511 --> 01:19:46.794
You cost us our one shot
with a real Broadway actor

01:19:46.796 --> 01:19:48.296
with actual connections.

01:19:48.298 --> 01:19:51.582
Look, I'm sorry if I...
Overreacted.

01:19:51.584 --> 01:19:53.000
That girl just bugs me.

01:19:53.002 --> 01:19:54.852
She's so full of herself, you know?

01:19:54.854 --> 01:19:59.307
Well, she's gone, so you got
your way, as always.

01:19:59.309 --> 01:20:00.942
You know, I've been
cleaning up your messes

01:20:00.944 --> 01:20:02.276
since we were kids.

01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:05.363
Without me, you wouldn't have a job

01:20:05.365 --> 01:20:07.198
or an apartment or any friends

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.517
because you piss everyone off.

01:20:09.519 --> 01:20:11.486
And that girl was the one person

01:20:11.488 --> 01:20:13.037
who could have gotten us closer

01:20:13.039 --> 01:20:16.690
to everything I've ever wanted.

01:20:16.692 --> 01:20:21.629
Would it have killed you to do
something for me for once?

01:20:21.631 --> 01:20:25.366
I made coffee this morning.

01:20:25.368 --> 01:20:27.218
And by the way,

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:29.303
I don't just watch you write.

01:20:29.305 --> 01:20:31.872
I'm writing the book for this thing.

01:20:31.874 --> 01:20:34.041
Selfish prick.

01:20:49.859 --> 01:20:52.726
What's the occasion?

01:20:52.728 --> 01:20:55.663
These are apology muffins.

01:20:58.401 --> 01:21:00.835
They do look very guilty.

01:21:00.837 --> 01:21:06.707
Tom, I am so sorry for everything.

01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:10.428
Last night I got so excited
about the show again,

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:13.698
just hearing Ivy sing our song.

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:17.918
I promise I will work
from here to eternity

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.671
to make it up to you...
And to <i>Bombshell,</i>

01:21:20.673 --> 01:21:23.591
if we're lucky enough
to get another chance.

01:21:23.593 --> 01:21:26.611
Than

01:21:26.613 --> 01:21:29.447
and I'm sorry I lied to you.
It was dumb.

01:21:29.449 --> 01:21:30.782
So, in the spirit of honesty

01:21:30.784 --> 01:21:35.586
and as your friend and partner...

01:21:35.588 --> 01:21:37.455
Can I say something?

01:21:37.457 --> 01:21:39.757
Yes.

01:21:39.759 --> 01:21:42.693
It's time to retire the scarves.

01:21:50.637 --> 01:21:52.453
Yo.

01:21:52.455 --> 01:21:53.805
Hey.

01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:58.792
Sorry.

01:21:58.794 --> 01:22:00.812
At least someone
had a good time last night.

01:22:11.273 --> 01:22:12.806
Hey.

01:22:12.808 --> 01:22:15.109
How did you find me?

01:22:15.111 --> 01:22:17.311
My God, where did you get that?

01:22:17.313 --> 01:22:19.163
I may have left that
on their fridge last night.

01:22:19.165 --> 01:22:20.648
What?

01:22:20.650 --> 01:22:21.982
- What's up, Jimmy?
- Come on.

01:22:21.984 --> 01:22:24.836
- Hey.
- You need to get back inside.

01:22:30.793 --> 01:22:35.346
This is everything I've written so far.

01:22:35.348 --> 01:22:37.798
I didn't expect this.

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.600
Yeah.

01:22:39.602 --> 01:22:42.854
The only reason
I'm trusting you with this

01:22:42.856 --> 01:22:45.606
is because I owe it to Kyle.

01:22:45.608 --> 01:22:47.692
Thank you.

01:22:47.694 --> 01:22:49.810
I think this could be really big.

01:22:54.117 --> 01:22:56.350
I figured you might need
a little extra caffeine

01:22:56.352 --> 01:22:57.702
this morning

01:22:57.704 --> 01:22:59.853
and a little extra grease.

01:22:59.855 --> 01:23:02.206
You're too kind.

01:23:02.208 --> 01:23:06.711
And I wanted to thank you
for what you said last night.

01:23:06.713 --> 01:23:08.996
You really helped pull me
out of my funk.

01:23:08.998 --> 01:23:11.966
What did I say?

01:23:11.968 --> 01:23:15.670
I'm teasing, darling...
Anytime.

01:23:15.672 --> 01:23:18.306
This storm's gonna pass for you too.

01:23:18.308 --> 01:23:21.058
Right now you're just
in the worst of it.

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:23.377
And...

01:23:23.379 --> 01:23:24.878
I'm sorry.
Is this a bad time?

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.064
Do you have company or something?

01:23:27.066 --> 01:23:28.882
Actually, I do.

01:23:28.884 --> 01:23:33.321
We're just having
a little work session.

01:23:33.323 --> 01:23:35.556
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:23:35.558 --> 01:23:38.058
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to intrude.

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.060
I heard you saved the day last night.

01:23:40.062 --> 01:23:43.397
I was on the subway
when they called me.

01:23:43.399 --> 01:23:45.032
Yeah.

01:23:45.034 --> 01:23:46.734
It was fun.

01:23:49.572 --> 01:23:52.406
So I guess I'll see you guys around.

01:23:52.408 --> 01:23:54.292
Bye.

01:23:59.381 --> 01:24:01.749
Right, then...

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.920
This kid's song better be good enough

01:24:06.922 --> 01:24:09.423
to get me out of bed
with a stinking hangover.

01:24:09.425 --> 01:24:12.593
Let's see, shall we?

01:24:15.615 --> 01:24:18.399
- What was that about?
- Nothing important.
