WEBVTT

00:00.186 --> 00:03.689
Aw, tits. I lost.
Goddamn rabbi is such a...

00:03.929 --> 00:05.929
Honest, moral,
forthright human being?

00:05.931 --> 00:07.564
- Yes, he is.
- I'm really coming

00:07.566 --> 00:09.566
around to Judaism.
Of course you're finding

00:09.568 --> 00:11.568
religion-- you somehow ended up
in the Shiva Bowl.

00:11.570 --> 00:13.169
Somehow?
And your husband's here to

00:13.171 --> 00:15.171
celebrate with you.
No. Have you guys seen him?

00:15.173 --> 00:16.906
Did he crash with any of you
last night?

00:16.908 --> 00:18.508
No, I haven't seen him.
And you know what?

00:18.510 --> 00:20.610
I don't blame him for
disappearing after you

00:20.612 --> 00:23.346
lineup-cheated on him with Ben.
I did not lineup-cheat with

00:23.348 --> 00:27.417
anyone.
I <i>maybe</i> lineup-flirted.

00:27.419 --> 00:29.419
Well, you're gonna
need all the advice you can get

00:29.421 --> 00:31.821
'cause you're playing me in the
Shiva.

00:31.823 --> 00:34.691
That's right. Ted has gone down.
I guess Ted could handle

00:34.693 --> 00:36.693
AIDS, but he couldn't handle
Draids.

00:36.695 --> 00:38.695
Your Draids team just sucks
the life out of anybody that

00:38.697 --> 00:40.797
plays you.
I am a score vacuum.

00:40.799 --> 00:43.867
And I'm coming to suck up your
score right now.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.935
Ew. God.

00:45.937 --> 00:49.305
The Ass-Eating Machine?

00:49.307 --> 00:52.108
No, it's a score vacuum.
Oh, shit, are you kidding me?

00:52.110 --> 00:54.144
Am I seriously gonna lose to
Taco?

00:54.146 --> 00:56.146
Come on!
Vernon Davis is in a cast, so I

00:56.148 --> 00:58.148
bench him.
Now he scores two touchdowns?

00:58.150 --> 01:00.150
What the hell's going on?
So weird. You should check

01:00.152 --> 01:02.218
his Twitter, maybe.
Um, he's not tweeting-- he's

01:02.220 --> 01:04.721
playing a game, Andr...
Wait a minute, he is tweeting.

01:04.723 --> 01:08.625
"Suck it, Pete. Hashtag 'you've
just been double-ent'Andre'd'"?

01:08.627 --> 01:12.629
Bam!

And, to add insult to injury,

01:24.543 --> 01:27.744
- look who you lost to.
- Oh, hi, I didn't see

01:27.746 --> 01:30.246
you there.
I was in the middle of a faxing.

01:30.248 --> 01:33.750
Introducing Taco Corp's latest
venture: the EBDB.

01:33.752 --> 01:37.554
Eskimo Brothers Database.
EBDB?

01:37.556 --> 01:39.656
Jesus, I can't believe I lost
to this.

01:39.658 --> 01:42.759
We log and catalogue your
Eskimo family tree for you.

01:42.761 --> 01:44.928
So all you have to do is put
your penis in someone and we do

01:44.930 --> 01:47.697
the rest.
I've been creating a vast Eskimo

01:47.699 --> 01:50.533
brothers network database
starting with myself.

01:50.535 --> 01:52.769
That is me.
Right up there is my Eskimo

01:52.771 --> 01:54.938
Eskimo brothers.
I spent a summer up in the

01:54.940 --> 01:57.373
Northwest Territories.
I've been working on Kevin's

01:57.375 --> 02:00.843
Eskimo family tree as well.
As you can see, Kevin is Eskimo

02:00.845 --> 02:03.846
brothers with Ruxin's dog, Kale,
through Jenny.

02:03.848 --> 02:08.084
The EBDB.
You bag it, we tag it.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.091
Oh, shit.♪

What? No, no, no, no, no, no,

02:21.917 --> 02:24.133
No!
Hector Rocha?

02:24.135 --> 02:26.970
Toe-besity is <i>my</i> thing!
It's <i>my</i> thing!

02:26.972 --> 02:28.972
I mean, she won't let
me, her husband, help her set

02:28.974 --> 02:32.208
her lineup, but she'll let Ben
go off and do it?

02:32.210 --> 02:34.210
You are in the Sacko Bowl.
Yeah, well, so are you.

02:34.212 --> 02:36.212
Where did we go wrong?
I'll tell you where we went

02:36.214 --> 02:38.448
wrong: David Wilson.
Darren McFadden.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.550
Roddy White.
Stevan Ridley.

02:40.552 --> 02:42.151
Aw.
You guys talking about the

02:42.153 --> 02:44.287
Should've-Would've-Could've
Bowl?

02:44.289 --> 02:46.956
You know what? Enough...
Yeah, we're in the Sacko Bowl,

02:46.958 --> 02:48.958
we get it.
Uh-uh-uh, I believe it's

02:48.960 --> 02:51.561
not called the Sacko anymore--
it's called the Ruxin.

02:51.563 --> 02:53.596
Certain people were referring
to it as the Ruxin.

02:53.598 --> 02:56.566
Well, one of you two losers
will be living with the Ruxin

02:56.568 --> 02:58.568
for the next year.
You know what?

02:58.570 --> 03:00.570
That trophy looks a lot more
like Joe Paterno than it

03:00.572 --> 03:02.572
actually looks like you.
And just like the ghost of

03:02.574 --> 03:06.676
Joe Paterno, it will loom like a
shame cloud over you.

03:06.678 --> 03:10.813
You saw but you didn't act.
You knew what was happening, and

03:10.815 --> 03:13.449
you let it happen.
And your legacy has been

03:13.451 --> 03:15.451
tainted.
Jenny calling.

03:15.453 --> 03:17.086
Don't answer it.
All right.

03:17.088 --> 03:19.989
Gentlemen, I need those lists
for the Eskimo Brothers

03:19.991 --> 03:22.925
Database.
And remember, penetration only.

03:22.927 --> 03:25.828
Eventually, I'll expand it to
BJs, Aborigine brothers, or

03:25.830 --> 03:28.298
HJs, Apache brothers.
But for now, I'm focusing on the

03:28.300 --> 03:32.068
Eskimo only.
"P" in the "V" goes in the EBDB.

03:32.070 --> 03:34.103
I love to see you motivated,
Taco.

03:34.105 --> 03:36.339
Hold on a second, I...
Oh, it's Jenny.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.341
Don't answer it.
Don't touch me, boys.

03:38.343 --> 03:42.478
I'm hot. I am on fire.
Dr. Rocha? The number one

03:42.480 --> 03:45.782
plastic surgeon in Chicago?
He is now honing in on my turf.

03:45.784 --> 03:48.151
He's doing toe-besity clients.
We be beefing.

03:48.153 --> 03:50.653
What?
Oh, we be beefing.

03:50.655 --> 03:53.289
Wow, like a Gary Coleman
commercial for Wendy's.

03:53.291 --> 03:56.693
No, this is me at anger level
ten.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.795
You're ready to give Rocha
the hot beef injection.

03:58.797 --> 04:00.963
Taco, looks like you better
add Dr. Rocha to the EBDB for

04:00.965 --> 04:03.299
Andre.
Yeah, uh, speaking of which,

04:03.301 --> 04:06.336
Andre, your list has a lot of
inconsistencies.

04:06.338 --> 04:08.371
A lot of the women on here don't
exist.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.206
What do you mean?
I mean, most of these women

04:10.208 --> 04:12.208
are dead and they died on the
<i>Titanic.</i>

04:12.210 --> 04:14.744
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>
<i>Does anyone answer phones</i>

04:14.746 --> 04:16.813
<i>anymore?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

04:16.815 --> 04:19.148
<i>What are you doing here?</i>
<i>I want you to come home.</i>

04:19.149 --> 04:21.351
<i>Come on. Stop being a baby.</i>
<i>No, I don't want to live with</i>

04:21.353 --> 04:23.653
<i>someone who doesn't respect me</i>
<i>as a fantasy football player.</i>

04:23.655 --> 04:26.222
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>I value your opinions.</i>

04:26.224 --> 04:28.491
<i>Great, then let me help you</i>
<i>set your lineup.</i>

04:28.493 --> 04:30.493
<i>No.</i>
<i>I don't want to lose.</i>

04:30.495 --> 04:32.695
<i>But I can help you.</i>
<i>Why would I need help?</i>

04:32.697 --> 04:34.931
<i>So you don't lose.</i>
<i>Oh, you know what? That's it.</i>

04:34.933 --> 04:36.933
<i>I'll be upstairs, Peter.</i>
<i>Looks like I'm not the only</i>

04:36.935 --> 04:38.868
<i>one beefing today.</i>

04:42.832 --> 04:45.115
Welcome home.
Jesus Christ! Rafi!

04:45.355 --> 04:47.601
You should've seen
your face.

04:47.679 --> 04:48.691
You scared the shit out of me.

04:48.820 --> 04:50.820
You remember last year when I
took Baby Geoffrey to water

04:50.822 --> 04:52.655
survival?
Swim class.

04:52.657 --> 04:55.692
Okay, yeah. You made a deal
with me that if I did, I got to

04:55.694 --> 04:57.827
bang your sister.
Mm...

04:57.829 --> 04:59.829
And now, I am here to collect.

04:59.831 --> 05:01.998
I would love to hold up my
end of the deal, but my sister's

05:02.000 --> 05:04.801
already left town.
Oh, that's too...

05:04.803 --> 05:08.471
No. You're lying.
I can smell pussy in this house

05:08.473 --> 05:11.574
that's not my sister's.

05:11.576 --> 05:14.477
Whoa! Well, well, well!
Rebecca, you remember, uh,

05:14.479 --> 05:16.479
Rafi.
From our wedding, when they

05:16.481 --> 05:18.481
asked if anyone objected to this
union, he threw a sock full of

05:18.483 --> 05:20.717
quarters at me?
Yeah. Hey, bangs, I'm talking

05:20.719 --> 05:22.719
to you.
We have business to discuss.

05:22.721 --> 05:24.421
What is this about?
Is this about your stupid

05:24.423 --> 05:26.056
fantasy league?
Because I don't want to hear

05:26.058 --> 05:27.690
about it.
Fantasy league isn't stupid,

05:27.692 --> 05:29.859
Rebby, okay? It's cool.
Will you just tell me why

05:29.861 --> 05:32.095
you're interrupting me, please?
I'm sorry. I can explain.

05:32.097 --> 05:34.097
Last year, I took our son...
My son.

05:34.099 --> 05:36.032
...to water survival.
Swim class.

05:36.034 --> 05:38.435
And as a result, the deal
that he made was that you and I

05:38.437 --> 05:40.437
would have sex.
Not true. He's joking.

05:40.439 --> 05:42.439
It's a joke.
Not joking at all.

05:42.441 --> 05:44.441
Sex between us.
Very funny.

05:44.443 --> 05:47.577
Talking about your sister having
sex with your homeless friend?

05:47.579 --> 05:49.946
We're not friends at all.
This is a dirty, dirty,

05:49.948 --> 05:51.581
terrible thing to say to your
sister.

05:51.583 --> 05:54.017
Like you would even know what
a joke was, Rebby.

05:54.019 --> 05:56.019
Um, that's not true.
I have a pretty stellar sense of

05:56.021 --> 05:57.620
humor.
Ask the girls at Hadassah.

05:57.622 --> 05:59.622
You wouldn't even know a joke
if it hit you in the face.

05:59.624 --> 06:01.458
You've never known a joke.
You have <i>no</i> sense of humor.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.959
You're not funny!
I'm the funny one!

06:02.961 --> 06:04.594
I've always been the funny one
in the family.

06:04.596 --> 06:07.597
Hey, guys. Relax.
First of all, none of you are

06:07.599 --> 06:09.766
funny.
Jews aren't funny.

06:09.768 --> 06:12.535
Second, I think maybe we got off
on the wrong foot.

06:12.537 --> 06:15.371
The sex that we're gonna have is
strictly transactional.

06:15.373 --> 06:19.876
It is just dick in hole.
Hey, where are you going?

06:19.878 --> 06:22.612
Hmm.
She's feisty.

06:22.614 --> 06:25.248
I think she's into this guy.
Yeah. Why? 'Cause she

06:25.250 --> 06:27.250
screamed at you the whole time?
No, actually.

06:27.252 --> 06:29.385
'Cause she screamed at <i>you</i> the
whole time.

06:29.387 --> 06:31.421
Help me out here, bro.
What do I got to do to lock that

06:31.423 --> 06:33.423
down?
Well, she only dates Jewish

06:33.425 --> 06:35.425
guys, so the...
All right.

06:35.427 --> 06:37.994
...only way that this could
work is if you converted to

06:37.996 --> 06:39.996
Judaism.
I'll do that.

06:39.998 --> 06:41.631
Mm-hmm.
Hang on. Does that mean they

06:41.633 --> 06:43.833
have to cut my dick off?
You just got to snip the tip.

06:43.835 --> 06:47.070
Oh, that's great, actually.
Because the tip of mine is black

06:47.072 --> 06:49.139
and hard, and I can't feel
anything since I got frostbite

06:49.141 --> 06:53.076
last year.

06:53.078 --> 06:55.078
Oh, I made up the couch all
nice and comfy for you.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.580
Couch?
No, no, I can't do a couch.

06:57.582 --> 06:59.749
I tweaked my back combing my
hair too fast.

06:59.751 --> 07:02.118
Oh, well, maybe a nice, hard
surface of the floor?

07:02.120 --> 07:06.723
No, no, I don't do floors.
Hmm...

07:06.725 --> 07:12.862
Yeah, this is better.
So, maybe we don't tell

07:12.864 --> 07:15.765
anybody about this.
Good idea.

07:15.767 --> 07:19.302
Good night, Kevin.
Good night, Pete.

07:19.304 --> 07:24.174
Oh!
Oh! Oh.

07:24.176 --> 07:27.477
Brittany, what is this doing
in our fridge?

07:27.479 --> 07:29.479
You know the rule here:
no solid foods.

07:29.481 --> 07:31.781
Juices only.
It's just birthday cake, and

07:31.783 --> 07:33.550
it's my birthday.
It's your birthday?

07:33.552 --> 07:35.552
You're getting older, too?
When were you gonna tell me

07:35.554 --> 07:37.187
about this?
I'm really sorry, but you're

07:37.189 --> 07:39.022
fired.
Okay.

07:39.024 --> 07:42.125
Just pack your shit up...
Hey! We had a deal.

07:42.127 --> 07:45.395
Three years ago, over tapas, we
agreed to split the body, 50-50.

07:45.397 --> 07:47.397
You got the top half, I got the
bottom half.

07:47.399 --> 07:49.732
Breasts were always
international waters, but now?

07:49.734 --> 07:51.734
I see these toe-besity ads?
Whoa. We be beefing, son.

07:51.736 --> 07:53.736
Oh, I don't want to be beefing.

07:53.738 --> 07:55.505
No, well, we beefing.
But I don't want to be

07:55.507 --> 07:57.140
beefing.
Well, you better come up with

07:57.142 --> 07:59.142
a beef substitute.
Here's what I think.

07:59.144 --> 08:01.144
Why don't we join forces?
And instead of being number one

08:01.146 --> 08:03.146
and number two, we can be one
giant number one.

08:03.148 --> 08:05.148
Why would you want to partner
with me?

08:05.150 --> 08:06.749
You've always been such a dick
to me.

08:06.751 --> 08:09.185
It's like I have a
movie franchise and we're doing

08:09.187 --> 08:11.721
pretty well, but it's starting
to get old.

08:11.723 --> 08:15.191
And what I need is Dwayne "The
Rock" Johnson-- A.K.A. you-- to

08:15.193 --> 08:17.560
step in and help me go to the
next level.

08:17.562 --> 08:20.063
I'm your Rock.
I'm your franchise Viagra.

08:20.065 --> 08:22.065
So what do you think?
Yeah.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.200
Let's turn this <i>G.I. Joe</i>
into <i>G.I. Joe: Retaliation.</i>

08:24.202 --> 08:26.402
<i>G.I. Joe:Retaliation.</i>
<i>Have a piece of cake.</i>

08:26.404 --> 08:28.404
<i>I don't eat that shit.</i>
<i>Nice.</i>

08:28.406 --> 08:30.840
<i>What possible reason could</i>
<i>you have to want Rafi to become</i>

08:30.842 --> 08:33.076
<i>a Jew?</i>
<i>Because Baby Geoffrey listens</i>

08:33.078 --> 08:35.445
<i>to Rafi.</i>
<i>So if Rafi becomes Jewish, then</i>

08:35.447 --> 08:38.047
<i>Geoffrey will become Jewish.</i>
<i>How are you gonna get Rafi to</i>

08:38.049 --> 08:40.549
<i>become Jewish?</i>
<i>Rafi wants to get his filthy,</i>

08:40.552 --> 08:42.885
<i>disgusting hands up that long,</i>
<i>denim skirt of my sister's.</i>

08:42.886 --> 08:44.520
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I get it.</i>

08:44.522 --> 08:46.522
<i>I was gonna stop on the way</i>
<i>home and grab something to eat</i>

08:46.524 --> 08:48.524
<i>for dinner-- do you want me to</i>
<i>grab you anything?</i>

08:48.526 --> 08:50.526
<i>I feel like we've been eating</i>
<i>in a lot.</i>

08:50.528 --> 08:52.695
<i>Do you want to go out tonight?</i>
<i>I'd... No, I mean, I could</i>

08:52.697 --> 08:54.864
<i>grab some Indian or sushi...</i>
<i>Why don't you guys splurge</i>

08:54.866 --> 08:56.866
<i>and go out?</i>
<i>Enough with the jokes, okay?</i>

08:56.868 --> 08:58.935
<i>Enough.</i>
<i>Look, I know in the past I've</i>

08:58.937 --> 09:01.871
<i>kidded around with you guys a</i>
<i>little bit that you like to, you</i>

09:01.873 --> 09:04.807
<i>know, suck each other's dicks</i>
<i>and crank each other's</i>

09:04.809 --> 09:07.644
<i>buttholes.</i>
<i>But in this case, I really am</i>

09:07.646 --> 09:10.980
<i>truly happy for you two.</i>
<i>Let me know when you guys go</i>

09:10.982 --> 09:13.283
<i>full penny-- I'll write it down</i>
<i>in the EBDB.</i>

09:13.285 --> 09:15.818
<i>I have an announcement.</i>

09:15.820 --> 09:18.454
<i>The number one and number two</i>
<i>plastic surgeons in Chicago are</i>

09:18.456 --> 09:21.758
<i>about to perform a plastic</i>
<i>merger-y.</i>

09:21.760 --> 09:23.760
<i>Whoa, couple ballers.</i>
<i>What's going on here?</i>

09:23.762 --> 09:25.762
<i>I thought you guys were, like,</i>
<i>bitter rivals.</i>

09:25.764 --> 09:27.764
<i>No, that's all in the past.</i>
<i>You see, we realized that we</i>

09:27.766 --> 09:31.167
<i>share a common enemy.</i>
<i>Hospitals.</i>

09:31.169 --> 09:32.802
<i>Wh-Who likes to go to a</i>
<i>hospital?</i>

09:32.804 --> 09:34.804
<i>There's all these bright</i>
<i>fluorescent lights.</i>

09:34.806 --> 09:37.440
<i>All these old, sick people.</i>
<i>What if it was, instead of a</i>

09:37.442 --> 09:40.009
<i>hospital, a club-spital?</i>
<i>We're gonna dim the lights.</i>

09:40.011 --> 09:42.011
<i>Mm-hmm. Get a DJ in there.</i>
<i>Instead of an</i>

09:42.013 --> 09:43.646
<i>anesthesiologist, you get a</i>
<i>mixologist.</i>

09:43.648 --> 09:45.648
<i>So when you go out, you're going</i>
<i>out with a Red Bull and a</i>

09:45.650 --> 09:47.650
<i>roofie, not just some needle in</i>
<i>your arm.</i>

09:47.652 --> 09:49.285
<i>You guys got it all figured</i>
<i>out.</i>

09:49.287 --> 09:51.521
<i>Well, look, it's not just</i>
<i>about making a ton of money and,</i>

09:51.523 --> 09:53.623
<i>you know, getting a tuggy in the</i>
<i>back of your red Porsche.</i>

09:53.625 --> 09:55.625
<i>Sure, I've boned it out in the</i>
<i>changing room of a</i>

09:55.627 --> 09:57.627
<i>Aeropostale...</i>
<i>I've seen the pictures.</i>

09:57.629 --> 09:59.996
<i>...but I also like to give</i>
<i>back-- that's why I started</i>

09:59.998 --> 10:02.465
<i>No Child Cleft Behind.</i>
<i>Like a cleft palate?</i>

10:02.467 --> 10:04.467
<i>We go in to El Salvador, fix</i>
<i>those kids up.</i>

10:04.469 --> 10:06.469
<i>Once I thought of that pun, I-I</i>
<i>knew I had to give back.</i>

10:06.471 --> 10:08.471
<i>See? A lot of people are</i>
<i>always focused on feeding the</i>

10:08.473 --> 10:10.473
<i>people in the third world</i>
<i>countries, but they don't</i>

10:10.475 --> 10:12.475
<i>realize they're actually pretty</i>
<i>ugly.</i>

10:12.477 --> 10:15.845
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>
<i>Uh, if you'll excuse me, fellas,</i>

10:15.847 --> 10:18.548
<i>I think I see a couple of ladies</i>
<i>that need to take a visit to the</i>

10:18.550 --> 10:20.950
<i>back of my red Porsche and tug</i>
<i>me out.</i>

10:20.952 --> 10:22.985
<i>See you.</i>
<i>I think he's gonna go talk to</i>

10:22.987 --> 10:25.221
<i>those girls.</i>
<i>And I'm gonna watch.</i>

10:25.223 --> 10:27.357
<i>Guys, this is amazing.</i>
<i>He's my new best friend.</i>

10:27.359 --> 10:29.359
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>You guys are no longer my</i>

10:29.361 --> 10:32.428
<i>favorite couple.</i>
<i>Nip/Suck just took first prize.</i>

10:33.720 --> 10:35.589
Pete, I'm using your computer!

10:38.094 --> 10:40.522
Did you put a password on this?

10:40.642 --> 10:42.096
Yes, I put a password on there.

10:42.098 --> 10:43.697
Why?
Because we're playing each

10:43.699 --> 10:45.699
other this weekend.
I don't want you to have access

10:45.701 --> 10:47.701
to my scout team.
And, by the way, you're a shit

10:47.703 --> 10:49.703
pig-- you missed the bowl in the
bathroom.

10:49.705 --> 10:51.338
I thought pee didn't bother
you.

10:51.340 --> 10:53.340
Well, pee doesn't bother me
when it's my pee.

10:53.342 --> 10:55.342
I don't think this is about
pee at all.

10:55.344 --> 10:57.511
You know what? It's not.
I'm a little hurt that you

10:57.513 --> 10:59.513
didn't tell me about the Andre
long con.

10:59.515 --> 11:01.648
Buddy, that's how this game's
played-- you know that.

11:01.650 --> 11:03.717
No, it's not how it's played
between us.

11:03.719 --> 11:07.221
Oh, well, well, well.
Did we come at a bad time?

11:07.223 --> 11:09.656
You remember your Uncle Kevin.
Hello.

11:09.658 --> 11:11.658
Thank you.
They're dangling in my face.

11:11.660 --> 11:13.293
Yeah. He wants to say hi to
you.

11:13.295 --> 11:15.295
What are you doing here?
Well, I wanted to show him

11:15.297 --> 11:17.725
his new home 'cause either way
he's ending up here unless...

11:17.727 --> 11:20.295
Are you guys fighting?
No, we're not fighting.

11:20.297 --> 11:23.364
Pete's just trying to pin him
being in the Sacko on me!

11:23.366 --> 11:25.800
Oh, the fact remains, if you
had told me about the Vernon

11:25.802 --> 11:28.036
Davis Twitter con, then I would
not be in the Sacko Bowl.

11:28.038 --> 11:30.104
Fact.
No, Pete you are in the Sacko

11:30.106 --> 11:33.541
because you made poor decisions,
like picking up Knowshon Moreno

11:33.543 --> 11:35.710
and then dropping him before he
gets big.

11:35.712 --> 11:37.745
Which makes sense because you
have commitment issues.

11:37.747 --> 11:39.948
Ha!
Oh, this coming from the

11:39.950 --> 11:42.083
person who is as disappointed in
his life as David Wilson is in

11:42.085 --> 11:44.118
his season.
Oh, I don't have to listen to

11:44.120 --> 11:45.920
this!
I'm going home, Peter!

11:45.922 --> 11:49.224
I'm worried that the Ruxin's
gonna be a child of divorce.

11:49.226 --> 11:51.426
Shut up.
Even a second wife needs a

11:51.428 --> 11:53.628
trophy wife.
Get that out of...

11:53.630 --> 11:55.997
Get away from me.

11:55.999 --> 12:00.301
I had a fight with Pete.
Do you want to talk about it?

12:00.303 --> 12:02.670
I mean, the guy is just being
such a jerk.

12:02.672 --> 12:05.073
He's trying to pin all his
lineup problems on me, and it's

12:05.075 --> 12:07.475
like, hello?
You created those problems, I

12:07.477 --> 12:09.677
didn't.
You know what happened?

12:09.679 --> 12:11.913
You guys let Ruxin come in
between you.

12:11.915 --> 12:14.282
Not Ruxin. <i>The</i> Ruxin.
Well, I'm glad you're home.

12:14.284 --> 12:16.684
I missed you.
I missed you, too.

12:16.686 --> 12:19.087
I need you.
I need you, too, babe.

12:19.089 --> 12:21.489
No, I mean...
I need you.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.925
Really?
Yeah. Do you want to?

12:23.927 --> 12:26.294
Oh, I'd love to help you with
your lineup, yes!

12:26.296 --> 12:28.696
Yeah? Yes.
All right, so, my defenses.

12:28.698 --> 12:31.099
You know, I've got Dallas in
there, which is great...

12:31.101 --> 12:33.101
Or, we could pick up
Tennessee off the waiver wire.

12:33.103 --> 12:35.303
They're playing the Jags.
Yeah? Yeah, we could do that.

12:35.305 --> 12:37.505
We might have to tinker a
little.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.507
Oh, I will certainly be
tinkering tonight.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.509
I think we should totally
tinker all night long.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.511
You want to tinker?
Oh, I'd love to tinker.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.713
Yeah?
Yeah. Tinker away.

12:45.715 --> 12:49.250
Mm-hmm.

12:49.252 --> 12:52.954
And we are done.
Cheers.

12:52.956 --> 12:56.524
Cheers to you, partner.
All right, we got to go big.

12:56.526 --> 13:01.896
QVC, product lines, even a
stand-up comedy club, slash,

13:01.898 --> 13:04.132
plastic surgery place.
I'm not interested in any of

13:04.134 --> 13:06.534
that, but here's your plane
ticket.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.736
Where are we going?
We're not going anywhere.

13:08.738 --> 13:11.139
You're going to El Salvador.
What? I don't want to go to

13:11.141 --> 13:13.341
El Salvador.
Well, the contract you just

13:13.343 --> 13:15.977
signed says you're gonna go
there for three years and run No

13:15.979 --> 13:17.979
Child Cleft Behind.
But I don't want to do that.

13:17.981 --> 13:20.148
You can come up with a better
pun, be my guest.

13:20.150 --> 13:22.317
Wait a second, you partnered
with me just to get rid of me,

13:22.319 --> 13:24.719
didn't you?
What about the team, the...

13:24.721 --> 13:27.021
the <i>GI Joe: Retaliation?</i>
<i>You can watch that movie on</i>

13:27.023 --> 13:29.390
<i>your flight over.</i>
<i>In 3-D?</i>

13:29.392 --> 13:31.826
<i>Mm... no.</i>
<i>Oh, then what's the point?</i>

13:31.828 --> 13:34.729
<i>Oof.</i>
<i>This does not look good.</i>

13:34.731 --> 13:37.165
<i>Why did you sign it?</i>
<i>Did you read it through?</i>

13:37.167 --> 13:39.567
<i>No, he-he just told me to</i>
<i>trust him, and I like that...</i>

13:39.569 --> 13:41.769
<i>outfit he wears.</i>
<i>Well, he's also got no</i>

13:41.771 --> 13:44.172
<i>loopholes in this contract.</i>
<i>I think you're screwed.</i>

13:44.174 --> 13:46.374
<i>Just buy your way out of it.</i>
<i>I'll be bankrupt.</i>

13:46.376 --> 13:48.576
<i>So does this mean you're</i>
<i>going to El Salvador?</i>

13:48.578 --> 13:50.778
<i>For three años.</i>
<i>If you need a notary, I'm</i>

13:50.780 --> 13:53.014
<i>pretty sure I'm legal down</i>
<i>there.</i>

13:53.016 --> 13:55.383
<i>I got to go home.</i>
<i>Adios, Andre.</i>

13:55.385 --> 13:59.120
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>What? He needs to practice.</i>

13:59.122 --> 14:05.193
<i>I'm gonna miss this place.</i>
<i>Shitty carpet, cheap couch,</i>

14:05.195 --> 14:08.096
<i>horrible Christmas decorations.</i>
<i>They don't have that in El</i>

14:08.098 --> 14:10.264
<i>Salvador.</i>
<i>All right, Geoffrey, do you</i>

14:10.266 --> 14:12.467
<i>know what these are?</i>
<i>Dreidel.</i>

14:12.469 --> 14:14.469
<i>Oh. I don't want to tell you</i>
<i>what I thought it was, but,</i>

14:14.471 --> 14:16.471
<i>actually, don't worry about it.</i>
<i>I washed them off pretty good in</i>

14:16.473 --> 14:18.706
<i>the toilet.</i>
<i>So what do we do, we just spin</i>

14:18.708 --> 14:21.109
<i>'em?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:21.111 --> 14:23.478
<i>Like that? Oh, no!</i>

14:23.480 --> 14:25.446
<i>Hey, why don't you take your</i>
<i>candelabra here and run upstairs</i>

14:25.448 --> 14:27.648
<i>and practice your half Torah</i>
<i>like I taught you?</i>

14:27.650 --> 14:30.084
<i>♪ Baruch atah adonai eloheinu</i>
<i>mel...</i> ♪

14:30.086 --> 14:32.453
Oh.
Shalom.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.889
I didn't see you there.
Shalom.

14:34.891 --> 14:36.891
I was just telling my nephew
how great it is to be Jewish,

14:36.893 --> 14:39.093
'cause I'm pretty freaking
Jewish now.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.963
Are you?
I'm pretty much killing it on

14:41.965 --> 14:44.298
the Jew front.
Now that I keep a kosher

14:44.300 --> 14:46.567
toilet-kitchen, my life is
amazing.

14:46.569 --> 14:49.504
No more live pig for this guy.
Just dead pig, pig-milk soup.

14:49.506 --> 14:52.240
You can't eat pig if you're
kosher, and you can't eat a live

14:52.242 --> 14:54.609
pig ever.
I mean, they're hell to

14:54.611 --> 14:57.011
catch, but... delicious.
Like, I...

14:57.013 --> 14:59.414
You're joking.
Yeah, I was totally kidding.

14:59.416 --> 15:01.416
I don't eat any of that stuff.
All I eat pretty much now is,

15:01.418 --> 15:03.384
like, shrimp and lobster.
Okay, listen, I'm gonna be

15:03.386 --> 15:05.620
here for one more day, so are we
doing this, or are we not doing

15:05.622 --> 15:07.822
this?
Wait. Do you mean sex?

15:07.824 --> 15:10.191
Yes.
Then, yes, we are 100% gonna

15:10.193 --> 15:12.593
do this.
Fantastic, because I cannot

15:12.595 --> 15:15.096
think of one thing that would
piss my brother off more.

15:15.098 --> 15:17.231
Ha! Good.
And I cut the tip of my dick off

15:17.233 --> 15:19.667
for you.
I'm sorry?

15:19.669 --> 15:22.503
Yeah, boom, gonzo, because
it's Jewish.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.939
You circumcised yourself?
I had one of those, uh,

15:24.941 --> 15:27.041
paper cutters from a high school
that I robbed, and I just put my

15:27.043 --> 15:29.444
dick in there...
I don't need to hear the

15:29.446 --> 15:31.846
details.
...and shoonk!

15:31.848 --> 15:34.048
You know, to make matters
worse, Dr. Rocha wants me in

15:34.050 --> 15:36.284
El Salvador at Christmas now.
Man, that guy's so cool.

15:36.286 --> 15:38.486
On the off chance, is there
anybody in El Salvador that I

15:38.488 --> 15:41.656
could be Eskimo brothers with?
Okay, well, let's take a look

15:41.658 --> 15:44.859
at your file.
Here we go.

15:44.861 --> 15:51.499
"Andre... Nowzick."
All right, here we go.

15:51.501 --> 15:53.901
Wait a second.
You use your computer as a file

15:53.903 --> 15:56.304
cabinet?
Yeah, keep my files in my

15:56.306 --> 15:58.506
hard drive.
And what were you just

15:58.508 --> 16:00.842
typing?
Nothing. I like the sound.

16:00.844 --> 16:02.910
Okay, your Eskimo family tree...
Oh, boy, you don't even really

16:02.912 --> 16:04.912
have any Eskimo brothers in
Chicago, let alone El Salvador,

16:04.914 --> 16:07.315
aside from Kevin.
Oh.

16:07.317 --> 16:09.517
Yeah.
Shiva Komedi Somakanakram.

16:09.519 --> 16:11.486
You know how you could expand
your Eskimo brother network?

16:11.488 --> 16:13.488
It would be very easy.
You just have to sleep with your

16:13.490 --> 16:15.690
sister.
I'm not sleeping with my

16:15.692 --> 16:17.892
sister... no.
All you have to do is put the

16:17.894 --> 16:20.027
tip in, and all of these people,
my friend, they're all yours.

16:20.029 --> 16:22.396
This EBDB is useless.
I disagree.

16:22.398 --> 16:26.334
The EBDB is connecting the world
one bone at a time.

16:26.336 --> 16:29.837
Oh, for example, I just found
out that I'm Eskimo brothers

16:29.839 --> 16:32.740
with a priest-- a Father
Zaragosa.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.942
So cool.
Wait. That's the priest from

16:34.944 --> 16:37.178
Sofia's church.
Yeah, he had sex with

16:37.180 --> 16:39.347
Tiffany.
Oh! Taco, I love you, and I

16:39.349 --> 16:41.716
love the EBDB.
I got to go.

16:41.718 --> 16:44.185
Wait, wait, wait.
Will I see you?

16:44.187 --> 16:46.187
Well, if I don't, I want you
to know a few things.

16:46.189 --> 16:48.356
First, skull caps are never
cool.

16:48.358 --> 16:50.358
That vest looks like you
molested Margaret Thatcher's

16:50.360 --> 16:52.560
couch, and your cologne smells
like sweet baby doody.

16:52.562 --> 16:54.962
Mm.
Peace.

16:54.964 --> 16:58.533
Oh, hello, Father Zaragosa.
Hi, Rodney.

16:58.535 --> 17:01.369
Everybody calls me Ruxin.
Well, I have a favor to ask, or

17:01.371 --> 17:03.771
I'll have to tell.
Tell what?

17:03.773 --> 17:06.207
Well, that you're Eskimo
brothers with Taco.

17:06.209 --> 17:08.876
Goddamn Tiffany.
Tongue-stud Tiffany.

17:08.877 --> 17:11.945
Do you want Geoffrey out of
church school, is that it?

17:11.948 --> 17:14.781
No, no, no. I've realized
that having him out of the house

17:14.784 --> 17:17.617
on Sunday is perfect so that me
and my heathen friends can watch

17:17.619 --> 17:19.921
football.
What is it that you want?

17:19.923 --> 17:22.223
Walk with me, padre.
I want to talk to you about

17:22.224 --> 17:25.326
tongue-stud Tiffany.

17:25.328 --> 17:27.728
Oh, God.
What?

17:27.730 --> 17:29.730
What did you eat?
I ate a raw onion earlier

17:29.732 --> 17:31.933
that I found on the street.
That's the opposite of what

17:31.935 --> 17:34.135
you should have done.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.137
I didn't want to eat it, but
it just looked so good.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.139
Let's do it in the back.
You're not even drunk.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.341
No, the back of the van.
Oh, great.

17:40.343 --> 17:42.510
Oh, my God.
I want to do you

17:42.512 --> 17:44.946
office-style.
Ow. Office?

17:44.948 --> 17:46.948
This is gonna fulfill a
fantasy I've had since I was on

17:46.950 --> 17:49.116
welfare.
You're a fat black woman, and

17:49.118 --> 17:51.152
you're really mad at me because
I hadn't been looking for a job.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.421
I...
Ooh, what I'm gonna do to you

17:53.423 --> 17:55.423
isn't kosher. Oh, yeah. What?
Don't say that.

17:55.425 --> 17:57.425
That takes me out of it.
Shit. We're moving.

17:57.427 --> 17:59.427
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, shit. Hit the brakes!

17:59.429 --> 18:01.462
Hit the brakes!
I can't! I can't work on

18:01.464 --> 18:03.631
Shabbat!
What?!

18:03.633 --> 18:05.533
I can't work on Shabbat.
You don't know that? No, you...

18:05.535 --> 18:07.435
Quick, I want to be inside
you on point of impact.

18:07.437 --> 18:09.437
When I'm done with this guy,
his nose is gonna look exactly

18:09.439 --> 18:11.439
like Matthew McConaughey's.
So, what are you up to tonight?

18:11.441 --> 18:13.938
I'm going to this Asian comedy
show; it's called <i>Chop Shtick.</i>

18:14.058 --> 18:16.458
<i>It should be really great.</i>

18:20.145 --> 18:22.898
<i>My hand!</i>
<i>Hey, man, what the shit are</i>

18:22.900 --> 18:25.267
<i>you doing?</i>
<i>Help me. My hand's crushed in</i>

18:25.269 --> 18:26.777
<i>the door.</i>
<i>Just open the door, please!</i>

18:26.897 --> 18:28.548
<i>You just screwed my whole</i>
<i>thing up, man.</i>

18:28.668 --> 18:31.874
<i>This girl's kosher.</i>
<i>That means I got to put my meat</i>

18:31.876 --> 18:33.118
<i>in one hole and my milk in the</i>
<i>other.</i>

18:33.238 --> 18:35.377
<i>Aah, man hand!</i>

18:36.008 --> 18:38.542
"When Mary and Joseph reached
Bethlehem after a long and

18:38.782 --> 18:41.216
tiring journey, they looked for
a place to stay."

18:41.218 --> 18:43.318
Mary and Joseph are a lot
shorter than I thought.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.987
"'But,' he said, 'We have a
stable where you can stay.'"

18:45.989 --> 18:48.223
What's up?
I just spent the entire night

18:48.225 --> 18:50.592
chowing on your sister's
ruggala.

18:50.594 --> 18:52.794
Okay, so you had a one-night
stand, fine.

18:52.796 --> 18:54.996
We had an <i>all-night</i> stand.
Oh! Oh, God.

18:54.998 --> 18:57.232
You wore a condom, right?
No, no, no, no, no.

18:57.234 --> 18:59.400
She wouldn't let me, because the
only one I had I'd made myself

18:59.402 --> 19:01.803
out of pork sausage casings.
That's not kosher.

19:01.805 --> 19:04.239
No, it's not kosher.
Hey, move over.

19:04.241 --> 19:06.608
Oh.
You guys are looking at the

19:06.610 --> 19:09.010
number one plastic surgeon in
Chicago.

19:09.012 --> 19:11.246
Hey!
Whoa! I thought Dr. Rocha had

19:11.248 --> 19:13.481
you by the balls.
Yeah, until his hand was

19:13.483 --> 19:15.917
crushed.
Now he can't practice at all.

19:15.919 --> 19:18.186
And I don't have to go to El
Salvador.

19:18.188 --> 19:20.622
Christmas has come early this
year.

19:20.624 --> 19:23.024
Actually, it's Christmas
right now.

19:23.026 --> 19:25.026
Okay, well, Christmas came at
the exact right time, because

19:25.028 --> 19:27.262
I'm also beating Jenny in The
Shiva.

19:27.264 --> 19:29.497
Uh-uh, don't do that, 'cause
I am still in this.

19:29.499 --> 19:31.699
I'm still playing.
Oh, yeah, who do you have?

19:31.701 --> 19:33.802
Um, oh, the Titans defense. Ugh!
You're down by seven with

19:33.804 --> 19:36.204
four minutes to go.
No Shiva for you, girl.

19:36.206 --> 19:38.439
I am gonna be lucky if I get
a point out of these donkeys.

19:38.441 --> 19:40.475
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought that that was the

19:40.477 --> 19:42.677
play.
"The wise men followed the

19:42.679 --> 19:45.113
star until it stopped over the
place where the child was.

19:45.115 --> 19:48.016
They brought gifts of gold,
frankincense and myrrh and

19:48.018 --> 19:51.319
presented them to him."
Watch this.

19:51.321 --> 19:55.190
I worked on Baby Geoffrey's
lines with him a little bit.

19:55.192 --> 19:57.559
Come into my manger, and I'll
cut you with my knife.

19:57.561 --> 19:59.994
Oh, my God!

19:59.996 --> 20:02.197
Whoa!
Geoffrey! Geoffrey!

20:02.199 --> 20:04.132
Mr. Ruxin, Baby Jesus did not
have a switchblade!

20:04.134 --> 20:06.000
Maybe he should have.
Then he'd probably still be

20:06.002 --> 20:08.136
alive.
Oh, my God, there was a sack.

20:08.138 --> 20:10.138
It gets a point.
And a fumble.

20:10.140 --> 20:12.073
That's another pot.
Oh, my God, they're running

20:12.075 --> 20:14.309
it bk, you guys.
Oh...

20:14.311 --> 20:16.211
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Go! Go! Touchdown!

20:16.213 --> 20:18.213
Oh, no! My God!
What?!

20:18.215 --> 20:20.014
That's six points!
That was an eight-point play!

20:20.016 --> 20:21.850
It's just like the story of
the Hebrews in the temple with

20:21.852 --> 20:24.052
the oil.
It's like a Hanukkah miracle.

20:24.054 --> 20:26.054
Yeah, it is!
You did it! Yes!

20:26.056 --> 20:28.056
I just won The Shiva, and
because of the advice <i>you</i>

20:28.058 --> 20:30.258
<i>gave me!</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

20:30.260 --> 20:32.493
<i>It is a MacArthur Shiva with</i>
<i>no asterisks!</i>

20:32.495 --> 20:36.282
<i>I won! I am the champion!</i>
<i>Take that, dick cream!</i>

20:36.402 --> 20:38.769
<i>I won! I'm The Shiva!</i>
<i>Oh, yeah, won The Shiva!</i>

20:38.771 --> 20:42.606
<i>I won it! I won it!</i>
<i>Miss, you're making a scene</i>

20:42.608 --> 20:44.541
<i>in a church.</i>
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

20:44.543 --> 20:48.378
<i>I converted; I'm Jewish now.</i>
<i>Whoo!</i>

20:48.380 --> 20:50.514
<i>This is amazing.</i>
<i>Wait, wait, it looks like we</i>

20:50.516 --> 20:54.217
<i>also have a MacArthur Sacko.</i>
<i>Oh, no.</i>

20:54.219 --> 20:56.520
<i>It is decided.</i>
<i>No, no, no.</i>

20:56.522 --> 20:58.455
<i>No.</i>
<i>Damn it, and I lost because</i>

20:58.457 --> 21:00.881
<i>of the advice you gave me.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

21:01.001 --> 21:02.901
<i>Oh, I don't give a shit.</i>
<i>What?</i>

21:02.903 --> 21:04.670
<i>Shiva and the Sacko in the</i>
<i>same household.</i>

21:04.672 --> 21:06.572
<i>This is not going to go well.</i>
<i>You know what, Kevin?</i>

21:06.574 --> 21:08.807
<i>I don't want to be in a fight</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

21:08.809 --> 21:10.209
<i>I love you, man, let's just make</i>
<i>up.</i>

21:10.216 --> 21:13.006

21:13.126 --> 21:15.157
