WEBVTT

00:06.574 --> 00:08.742
Previously on E.R.:

00:14.782 --> 00:15.616
The surgery went well.

00:15.649 --> 00:16.650
So they say.

00:16.684 --> 00:17.485
You were lucky.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.586
( scoffs )

00:18.619 --> 00:21.322
Is that what I
think it is?

00:21.355 --> 00:23.124
I was going through
a religious phase.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.425
It's not America.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.727
You may have to adjust
your approach somewhat.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.462
Okay, then.
He's all yours.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.431
Watch the paracolyc
gutter.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.799
He's had a couple
of adhesions

00:31.832 --> 00:32.766
from an appendectomy.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.336
We're going home.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.478
( water running )

00:50.451 --> 00:54.655
You realize you've been
in there for 20 minutes?

00:54.688 --> 00:57.425
You miss me, or am I
wasting water?

00:57.458 --> 00:59.193
Both.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.730
How much longer
are you going to be?

01:02.763 --> 01:06.567
Your shift
doesn't start
for two hours.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.170
Yeah, there's an 8:00
meeting near here.

01:10.671 --> 01:11.739
You going
to go?

01:11.772 --> 01:14.642
I was thinking about it.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.249
Hello?

01:23.784 --> 01:27.155
Something wrong?

01:27.188 --> 01:28.256
Carter?

01:28.289 --> 01:30.391
What are you doing?

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.700 --> 01:41.835
We really can't help you
anymore, sir.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.304
But I'm not
a junkie.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.206
This stuff just finds
me, you know?

01:45.239 --> 01:46.640
How convenient.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.476
Hey, Frank, I need
another room for Mr. Hudlin.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.544
He says Exam Three
is full of ectoplasm.

01:50.578 --> 01:51.745
Did you cut
yourself
shaving?

01:51.779 --> 01:53.881
What?
Ooh, never
mind.

01:53.914 --> 01:54.915
Lipstick.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.350
( laughs )

01:56.384 --> 01:59.587
( coughing ):
Dr. Carter.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.655
Mrs. Breeland,
you need to
stay in bed.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.257
Otherwise, we might
be tempted

02:03.291 --> 02:04.725
to put somebody
else in it.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.494
Okay, I think we're
getting there.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.728
Hardly-- board number two

02:07.761 --> 02:09.830
is for the patients
in the halls.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.699
We have heat
exhaustion

02:11.732 --> 02:14.502
barbecue smoke
inhalation and boils

02:14.535 --> 02:15.269
all up for grabs.

02:15.303 --> 02:15.903
I love my job.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.405
No, you don't.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.906
Why the hell are you
dressed like that

02:18.939 --> 02:20.741
if you can't
prescribe
nothin'?

02:20.774 --> 02:23.844
Ah, the smell of
fresh med students
in the morning.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.513
God, what is it about them?

02:25.546 --> 02:26.680
They all seem so...

02:26.714 --> 02:27.948
Gullible? Immature?

02:27.981 --> 02:28.916
Vapid?

02:28.949 --> 02:30.351
I was going
to say sweet.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.619
Bee sting in One
is asking for you.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.886
All right, just tell
them to get started

02:32.920 --> 02:34.422
on their
orientation
manuals.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.556
I'll be with them
as soon as I can.

02:35.589 --> 02:36.590
Carter, MVA two
minutes out.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.226
But not to hold their breath.

02:38.226 --> 02:41.329
Dr. Carter, so, there's
a trauma coming in?

02:41.362 --> 02:43.664
Yeah, why don't
you take the bee
sting in One

02:43.697 --> 02:45.299
the wrist fracture
in Four

02:45.333 --> 02:46.700
and the burning
rash in Two?

02:46.734 --> 02:47.701
Care to give
me a hand?

02:47.735 --> 02:48.336
Why not?
Help me!

02:48.369 --> 02:49.803
Help me!

02:49.837 --> 02:52.340
Hey, that's just
been mopped,
damn it!

02:52.373 --> 02:54.242
You don't talk
if you're having
a real seizure.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.810
Remember that
for next time.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.979
Think it's always
this crazy here?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.248
Probably.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.282
They need to bring you back

03:01.315 --> 03:02.716
to the V.A.
hospital, sir.

03:02.750 --> 03:03.684
I don't understand.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.353
Your driver
will explain.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.688
You guys suck,
you know that?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.257
Don't bother,
we don't have any beds.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.291
So, what else
is new?

03:10.324 --> 03:12.826
No, I'm serious; try Mercy.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.694
They're refusing
patients, too.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.662
Well, then try Rush.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.664
We're completely filled.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.566
Look, I've been bounced
all over town with
this old guy.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.800
I'm running
out of gas,
and so is he.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.502
If I don't get him
into a bed

03:21.535 --> 03:23.437
his UTI's turning
into urosepsis.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.805
MAN:
I gotta make water!

03:24.838 --> 03:27.608
Yo, doc!

04:19.459 --> 04:20.494
You are one sadistic
bitch, you know that?

04:20.528 --> 04:21.462
Now, give me
your middle finger.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.730
I would if
I could.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.532
Any emergency meetings
get scheduled?

04:24.565 --> 04:26.800
Just one, about the spate
of E.R. closures

04:26.834 --> 04:27.768
in the area.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.370
I've advised the board

04:29.403 --> 04:32.005
that preliminary figures
are on the increase

04:32.039 --> 04:33.541
in our patient load by 34%.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.377
Who'd you take to La Scala's?

04:36.410 --> 04:37.811
Sorry?

04:37.845 --> 04:40.013
Which board member's
ass are you kissing?

04:40.047 --> 04:41.482
Now the ring finger.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.083
Robert, I simply compiled
a report.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.652
Nerve regeneration's
a millimeter a week.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.953
I am not kissing anyone's ass.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.588
And it is not my
dominant hand.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.790
In fact, I only agreed
to take on your responsibilities

04:49.823 --> 04:51.359
out of necessity.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.861
I'll be back in my
office in two weeks

04:53.894 --> 04:54.862
I hope you are.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.931
( groaning )

04:57.965 --> 05:00.568
Thought about upping
your Vicodin?

05:00.601 --> 05:02.403
Ibuprofen.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.771
I want to stay
clear-headed.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.105
That's probably
enough for today.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.474
No, keep going.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.475
Sorry, I have
another patient.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.411
Don't get too comfortable,
Kerry.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.879
WEAVER:
Anything else?

05:11.912 --> 05:12.946
Just your...

05:12.980 --> 05:14.415
continued support!

05:16.149 --> 05:17.117
Lizzie.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.820
Elizabeth,
how are you doing?

05:19.853 --> 05:21.489
Fine.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.123
Good.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.526
Well, uh,
we'll catch up downstairs.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.396
I heard rumors.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.764
All true, I'm afraid.

05:30.798 --> 05:34.535
The one face I missed seeing
in recovery.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.538
I'm so sorry, Robert.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.640
What, about my arm

05:39.673 --> 05:42.009
or about not
being there?

05:43.577 --> 05:44.578
How are you healing?

05:44.612 --> 05:46.914
Hurts like
a son of a bitch.

05:48.849 --> 05:49.983
You?

05:51.952 --> 05:52.953
Any sensory
function yet?

05:52.986 --> 05:55.656
Nope.
( pager beeps )

05:55.689 --> 05:57.491
It's a motorcycle
accident.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.460
I have to go,
I'm sorry.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.996
Dr. Corday, how
was London?

06:03.030 --> 06:04.031
Good.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.666
Timed your trip
right.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.435
Missed the pox
scare we had two
months ago.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.602
So I hear.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.503
How's Ella?

06:09.537 --> 06:10.538
Fine.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.839
Is it nice
to be back?

06:11.872 --> 06:14.442
I'm off to the E.R.,
I'll let you know.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.610
Okay, well,
good luck.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.469
WOMAN:
Bite me, panty smellers!

06:41.502 --> 06:43.070
Ma'am, you need
to calm down.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.472
Die, you scum-sucking
perverts!
Dr. Corday, hi.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.206
We need some
Haldol here!

06:46.239 --> 06:47.475
You think
that's necessary?

06:47.508 --> 06:48.476
( screams )
Yes!

06:48.509 --> 06:49.743
( screaming )

06:49.777 --> 06:51.545
Dr. C.,
looking good.
Thanks, Malik.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.647
So, what's the GCS on
this motorcycle trauma?

06:53.681 --> 06:54.648
Sorry, I didn't
do the run.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.216
Oh.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.552
Well, have um, the X-ray tech
come down for portables.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.987
You got it.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.789
And hold the C.T.
till we eyeball the patient.

07:01.822 --> 07:02.690
Hey, welcome back.

07:02.723 --> 07:03.857
Thanks.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.493
So, do you know any
of the specifics?

07:05.493 --> 07:08.529
16-year-old girl,
motorcycle versus utility pole

07:08.562 --> 07:09.897
no helmet-- Carter's
bringing her in.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.932
What's a chick doing
on a motorcycle?

07:11.965 --> 07:13.934
What's anyone doing
on a motorcycle?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.570
Have the rapid infuser
primed and ready.

07:16.604 --> 07:19.072
Draw up 100 of Fent,
four of Ativan.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.208
Make sure the airway drugs
are out of the box.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.946
It's like you never left.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.048
Yeah.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.786
CARTER:
Coming through here, please!

07:32.820 --> 07:33.621
We're going to need
some O-neg.

07:33.654 --> 07:34.722
She got a rhythm?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.123
PEA to agonal
just before arrival.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.991
Decreased
breath sounds
bilaterally.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.527
Intubated for agonal reps--
didn't know you were back yet.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.928
First day.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.062
When'd she lose
her pulse?
Never had one.

07:42.095 --> 07:42.896
Okay, everybody,
on my count.

07:42.930 --> 07:43.997
Ready, one, two--

07:44.031 --> 07:45.533
Hold transfer and compressions.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.534
Asystole.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.568
Abdomen's distended.

07:49.036 --> 07:49.770
Whoa.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.071
Uh...

07:51.104 --> 07:52.740
Uh, suction on high,
I need a yankauer.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.542
That's easily two liters.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.076
CARTER:
All right,
amp of epi.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.778
CORDAY:
Don't bother.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.582
Obvious C-spine fracture.

08:01.615 --> 08:02.950
She's not even a good
organ donor now.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.184
Is there family here?

08:04.217 --> 08:05.786
We're trying
to locate them.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.555
We can talk
to them.
No, it's fine.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.557
Just let me know
when they arrive.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.593
Be easier for you.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.731
MAN:
I could pull the trigger
right now if I wanted to

08:17.765 --> 08:19.633
'cause it's all right here.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.868
Welcome back,
Elizabeth.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.670
Do you have time
for a consult?

08:22.703 --> 08:23.871
As it turns
out, yes.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.673
What's he have,
belly pain?

08:25.706 --> 08:27.641
Well, only because he swallowed
a handful of nitroglycerin.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.611
No sudden moves
unless you want
me to blow!

08:30.644 --> 08:33.246
Milo has right upper quadrant
tenderness with rebound.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.313
I'm a human time bomb.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.683
He needs to be
cleared medically

08:35.716 --> 08:36.850
before we can
move him upstairs.

08:36.884 --> 08:37.951
I could go off at any minute.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.052
He could get
hypotensive.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.621
Are you scared? I'd be scared.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.623
No. Give him two
liters of saline

08:42.655 --> 08:44.256
and monitor him
for a few hours.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.193
Thank you.
Gallant hasn't
turfed

08:46.226 --> 08:47.160
a case
of psych all day.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.028
You wanted the consult.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.262
Dr. Lewis.
Yeah?

08:49.296 --> 08:50.831
We're to capacity,
I take it?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.032
Every bed,
every day

08:52.065 --> 08:53.601
since Mission
Hospital closed.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.335
I thought it was
just St. Paul's.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.204
Nope, and it doesn't help
that Weaver's been gone so much.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.272
She's gunning
for Romano's job.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.273
It keeps her
very busy.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.609
Dr. Lewis?

09:01.642 --> 09:02.342
Mr. Sprooner,
let me guess.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.310
You're still itchy.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.678
Yeah, but there's a...

09:04.712 --> 09:05.979
You need to give drugs
a chance to work

09:06.013 --> 09:07.314
and quit
scratching.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.682
Okay, but I think the guy
in the bed next to me

09:08.716 --> 09:10.150
just stopped
breathing.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.619
Great. Malik,
crash cart in Two.
You got it.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.686
Got a gang
shoot-out
here.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.854
Couple of DOA's
at the scene.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.155
Another rig's
coming in behind me.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.790
He said they wouldn't
shoot back.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.626
Where was she hit?
In the neck,
good airway.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.927
B.P.'s 100/76.
Pulse is stable at 100.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.261
Through and through?

09:21.294 --> 09:22.730
Only saw one hole
but it wasn't leaking air.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.632
You need
a hand?
Possible S.C.I.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.699
Where is he? Where's Ricky?
What's her
name?

09:25.733 --> 09:26.767
Alma.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.636
Just hang in
there, Alma.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.103
We're going to
try and find him
for you, okay?

09:30.137 --> 09:31.839
Set up a cross table
lateral of the neck.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.173
Dr. Carter

09:33.206 --> 09:34.307
still got these med students
waiting on you.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.342
Want me to jump
on that?

09:35.375 --> 09:36.944
Better idea;
you talk to them.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.814
So, newbies, huh?

09:40.848 --> 09:41.882
Mm-hmm.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.752
You don't want
to work here.

09:44.785 --> 09:45.853
CORDAY:
Haleh

09:45.886 --> 09:46.987
get that D.B.
out of here.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.088
And take it
where?

09:48.121 --> 09:48.989
Someplace else.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.123
How much O2?

09:50.157 --> 09:51.324
Five liters by
nasal cannula.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.292
Are you hurt anywhere else?

09:52.325 --> 09:53.794
They shot him.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.295
Oh, please, God,
don't let him be hurt.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.797
We're going to try
and find out for you, Alma

09:56.830 --> 09:58.331
but you got to try
and help us, too.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.933
Do you have pain
anywhere else?
I don't know.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.702
( crying ):
I... I can't tell.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.370
How about your legs?
No.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.673
I can't feel them.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.374
( crying )

10:07.407 --> 10:08.809
Gallant, need
a hand here.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.377
We're talking
smithereens here!

10:10.410 --> 10:12.012
Have you ever seen
smithereens?!

10:12.045 --> 10:13.914
Listen, Haleh, I'm
on psych rotation.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.016
I really shouldn't
be helping you, but...

10:16.049 --> 10:17.184
Haleh, this is
a dead body.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.086
You ought to go
to med school.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.088
Can't take her
to the morgue yet;
waiting on family.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.255
( grunts )

10:24.391 --> 10:26.393
Why am I not exploding?

10:26.426 --> 10:27.861
No movement below
the umbilicus.

10:27.895 --> 10:28.929
What's wrong
with me?

10:28.962 --> 10:29.930
Why can't
I feel anything?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.031
You might just have

10:31.064 --> 10:32.232
some bruising
to your spinal cord.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.667
I need 30 migs
per kilo

10:33.701 --> 10:35.335
of methyprednisodlone
I.V. bolus.

10:35.368 --> 10:36.436
Where the hell's
X-ray?

10:36.469 --> 10:38.305
Behind you.
Start with the chest.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.441
( crying ):
Please, I need Ricky.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.976
Stay with us, Alma.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.012
Entry wound left mid
sternocliedomastoid

10:45.045 --> 10:46.146
with a large
hematoma.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.214
There's blood
behind the ear

10:47.247 --> 10:48.749
as well.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.283
It'd be nice to hear
about that ultrasound.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.685
Morrison's is dry.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.386
The peridcolic
gutters look good.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.022
Bladder is, uh...

10:55.055 --> 10:57.090
Shooting...
Wait, wait!

10:57.124 --> 10:58.792
She's pregnant.

10:58.826 --> 10:59.760
What?

10:59.793 --> 11:01.094
Looks like about 11 weeks.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.395
Fetal heart
rate is 140

11:02.429 --> 11:04.264
baby appears healthy
and intact.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.365
I need Ricky.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.768
( screaming and crying )

11:07.801 --> 11:10.203
It's my arm, man!
It hurts like a...

11:10.237 --> 11:11.304
Do something already!

11:11.338 --> 11:13.040
B.P.'s steady
at 120

11:13.073 --> 11:14.241
but he's been
like this the
whole time.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.342
Ricky, you need
to calm down!

11:15.375 --> 11:17.377
Did you give
him anything?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.179
Maybe this'll help.
He wouldn't hold
still long enough.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.248
Good breath sounds,
full trauma panel

11:21.281 --> 11:23.951
chest and A-P pelvis.
He's a regular
customer.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.119
Through and through
to the right triceps.
( screams )

11:26.153 --> 11:27.287
You were lucky.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.956
Yeah? You should see
the other guy.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.291
( laughs )
No fracture
or deformity.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.762
So, what, just go back
and forth shooting each other

11:34.795 --> 11:35.763
till all
of you are dead?

11:35.763 --> 11:36.997
An eye for an eye, man.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.398
Yeah, meanwhile his
girl gets shot.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.767
They got Alma, too?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.101
Yeah, she was hit
in the neck

11:41.134 --> 11:42.135
and it's pretty
serious.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.037
( screams )

11:44.071 --> 11:45.405
Come on, dawg!

11:45.438 --> 11:46.339
Let me go!

11:46.373 --> 11:47.474
Calm down!

11:47.507 --> 11:48.776
I've got to kill those bitches!

11:48.776 --> 11:49.777
You already did!

11:49.810 --> 11:53.346
( breathing heavily )

11:55.515 --> 11:57.284
Repeat hamogram
and update tetanus.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.452
Keep your hand there
and don't take it off

11:59.486 --> 12:00.353
until you get upstairs.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.488
Got it.

12:01.521 --> 12:02.522
Dr. Corday,
when you have a chance.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.124
Be right there.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.926
Make sure the blood bank
sends type-specific

12:05.959 --> 12:07.360
straight to the O.R.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.962
Have the anesthesiologist
call me with any questions.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.197
Are you the one?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.498
A neurosurgeon
will perform the operation.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.833
He'll be talking with you
shortly.

12:12.866 --> 12:13.867
Don't...
I'm sorry?

12:13.901 --> 12:15.235
Don't let me die.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.938
WOMAN:
You're one cold-hearted bitch

12:17.971 --> 12:19.372
you know that?

12:19.406 --> 12:22.342
I don't have any damn
pity for you, whore.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.812
I'm talking to you,
piss face!

12:24.812 --> 12:27.314
Don't you dare turn
your back on me

12:27.347 --> 12:29.149
you stuck up little
ass-shaker!

12:29.182 --> 12:31.852
Where the hell do you
think you're going?!

12:34.855 --> 12:36.189
Pardon me, darling.
Thank you.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.024
Doc, I'm going to miss
the whole season here.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.291
Keep your cup on, man.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.492
I should have been
off two hours ago.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.861
You don't see me
complaining.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.162
What are you still
doing here?

12:42.195 --> 12:44.031
I can't leave
till my patient gets a bed.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.966
Them's the rules.
Don't sound so
upset about it.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.500
Up to level 12.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.469
Hey, turn that thing off.
It disturbs the patients.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.838
Frank, what'd I miss?

12:50.838 --> 12:52.072
County HHS needs
to talk to you.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.173
Ditto, Human Resources.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.842
Anything from
Dr. Romano?

12:54.875 --> 12:57.377
Oh, he called half an hour ago,
and an hour before that.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.412
Somebody from Dr. Rydell's
office called

12:59.446 --> 13:01.148
to confirm
your appointment for, uh...

13:01.181 --> 13:02.515
What the hell is this?

13:02.549 --> 13:04.284
Why is Stella Willits
still on the board?

13:04.317 --> 13:06.419
I called to have
her admitted to
Psych hours ago.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.455
I haven't had a chance
to evaluate her yet.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.357
Well, save yourself
the trouble-- she's nuts.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.459
She's a frequent flier
with a history

13:12.492 --> 13:14.094
of bogus medical complaints.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.428
Yeah, well,
with all due respect

13:15.462 --> 13:17.030
I'd like to determine
that myself.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.932
The E.R. doesn't have the time
or the manpower

13:18.966 --> 13:20.167
to deal with hypochondriacs.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.301
That's what
your department's for.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.236
Now, turf her,
get her off my board.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.138
Yeah, but it's
part of my...
I said get rid of her.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.406
Stubborn,
got to give you that.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.275
How are those medical students
coming along?

13:28.308 --> 13:30.377
Oh, just fine. I gave them
three volumes of Rosen to read.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.879
Carter,
Urology on two.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.213
You think you can come up
with something

13:33.246 --> 13:34.581
a little bit more interactive?

13:34.614 --> 13:37.918
Yeah, Sam Polivy's back
with a ureteral stone.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.486
P-O-L-I-V-Y.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.488
Hey, Abby, are those labs
back on Melinda Harrell?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.123
Let me check.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.291
Hi, I'm Erin Harkins...
I'm on the phone.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.592
Yeah, you're busy,
we get that

13:45.625 --> 13:47.060
but can we get
an approximate time

13:47.094 --> 13:49.029
that orientation
will begin? Doctor?

13:49.062 --> 13:51.298
Please don't tell me you're
keeping med students waiting.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.199
Check with Pratt.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.901
I'm checking with you.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.269
Intractable pain
and hydronephrosis.
Dr. Carter?

13:56.303 --> 13:58.171
I cannot admit him
to Eight West right now.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.572
There are no beds.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.508
I'm Dr. Weaver, chief
of Emergency Medicine.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.911
I will give you a brief tour
of the Ambulance Bay

14:03.911 --> 14:05.979
after which our chief resident
will give you

14:06.013 --> 14:08.381
his undivided attention,
because, as you'll learn

14:08.415 --> 14:09.549
it's his primary responsibility.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.251
Come on.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.485
I'm sorry, what was
that you were just saying?

14:12.519 --> 14:13.586
Demolition site
accident downtown.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.654
At least a dozen
injuries.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.923
What's the E.T.A.?
Now.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.457
I've got to call
you back.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.127
Paramedics can transport using
standing field protocols...

14:20.160 --> 14:21.228
We've got multiples.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.163
Wait here.
Who's on first?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.932
The sick one. Frank Chambers,
40 years old.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.934
Severe chest trauma when a
pedestrian walkway fell on him.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.435
What?
Wrecking ball crane collapsed.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.603
B.P. 80 systolic,
but he's headed the wrong way.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.205
Tachy 120.
Denies L.O.C.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.141
Crepitus on right side;
we need to page surgery.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.008
Mr. Chambers,
can you talk?

14:35.042 --> 14:36.409
It hurts too much.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.510
He told me he thought
his ribs were broken.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.479
Who are you?
His secretary.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.314
Sustained only a facial
lac and had chest pain
at the scene

14:41.348 --> 14:42.515
but refused treatment.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.984
All right, you need
to be examined.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.118
After he's
taken care of.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.286
He's decreased
on the left.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.654
Let's hear it.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.589
Been hearing it all the way
from Michigan Avenue.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.491
Ken Ambrose, 34. Obvious tib-fib
fracture with dislocation.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.093
F.D. had to lift a flower shop
off his leg.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.427
Not a shop, it's a kiosk.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.963
Vitals normal, but tachy
at 120 with a liter in.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.430
Gave him ten of M.S.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.299
( screaming ):
Don't touch it! It hurts!

14:59.332 --> 15:00.968
Okay, uh,
just bear with us.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.669
We'll give you
something for that.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.337
Oh, God, I see a light.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.506
You're not dying,
it's just your ankle.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.108
Oh, God. Oh!

15:19.552 --> 15:20.387
Watch where
you're going!

15:20.420 --> 15:21.454
You ran into me.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.057
Haleh! Where's the trauma?

15:24.091 --> 15:25.192
Throw a rock, honey.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.259
Blunt chest in Two.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.995
You look wonderful,
by the way.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.596
85 pounds
and counting.

15:29.629 --> 15:30.998
Good for you.

15:30.998 --> 15:31.631
You cut your hair?

15:31.664 --> 15:33.033
Mm-hmm.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.101
B.P.'s falling,
70 systolic.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.036
Keep squeezing
that bag.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.505
Where are we?
Flail with crepitus,
needs a tube at least.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.007
Who has an angio cath?
Right here.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.541
How can I help?

15:41.574 --> 15:44.311
Given that there's only one,
I don't see how you can.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.512
What is that?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.180
It's a tube
to help him breathe.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.748
He has a collapsed
lung, Tammy.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.317
This will re-inflate it.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.019
I need a thoracostomy tray.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.321
Right, let's see how much air
he's got in here.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.588
Oh, God.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.657
( hissing )

15:57.690 --> 16:00.027
Is that any better,
Mr. Chambers?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.494
Sats 88.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.331
He's not talking anymore.
Why is he not talking?

16:04.364 --> 16:05.732
Because he can't.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.468
Let's Betadine
the whole chest,
just in case.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.769
Do you need any help?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.704
Ah, yes, with his wife.
She's bleeding.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.141
I'm not his wife.
Then you shouldn't be
in here.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.309
Where's the rapid infuser?

16:16.343 --> 16:17.544
Chuny, we need that blood.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.346
All right.
Let's get her on a monitor.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.514
She refused treatment
for chest pain at the scene.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.283
Okay, I'm Dr. Kovac.
Can you come with me?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.617
No, somebody needs
to be with him.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.718
Okay, I'm in.

16:25.752 --> 16:26.719
Hook me up.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.121
Let us take care of him

16:28.155 --> 16:30.090
and Dr. Kovac
will take care of you.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.224
Come, please.

16:35.662 --> 16:39.232
( screaming )
Pratt, what are you doing
down there?

16:39.266 --> 16:40.333
Lewis, what are you doing
up there?

16:40.367 --> 16:41.634
This guy's got no
D.P. pulse.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.337
It's called a trauma
assessment.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.473
Lungs clear, chest tones normal.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.507
Got the Doppler.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.641
Give it to me.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.177
Sweet Jesus.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.644
Explains no pulse.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.546
Let's get a C.B.C.,
chem seven, dip of urine

16:53.580 --> 16:55.148
chest and pelvis X-rays.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.649
Chen, give me your hands.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.784
What are you doing?

16:57.817 --> 17:00.320
Hold tight. Ken!

17:00.353 --> 17:02.522
Huh?
Have you ever been
to Hawaii before?

17:02.555 --> 17:03.590
Uh-uh.

17:03.623 --> 17:04.723
Well, pretend you're there now.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.126
Pratt!

17:06.159 --> 17:07.327
( screaming )

17:07.359 --> 17:08.627
( gasping )

17:08.661 --> 17:11.198
I can't believe you.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.332
I feel better.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.567
I feel totally better.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.469
I feel totally sick.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.806
Why would you reduce an ankle
with no pain meds?

17:19.839 --> 17:22.474
No pulse is no blood
is dead tissue.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.145
In other words,
I just saved your foot.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.513
Thank you. You're wonderful.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.618
Subclavian's in.
Is that the film?

17:31.651 --> 17:34.287
500cc's are out
the chest tube.

17:34.321 --> 17:35.755
He's holding his pressure.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.590
No pneumothorax.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.593
Looks like a widened mediastinum
and a loss of the A-P window.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.530
Hard to tell.
Pulmonary contusion's
pretty impressive.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.232
One of us should go
with him to C.T.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.534
Not unless you're prepared
to crack the chest.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.503
He's got flail chest,
pulmonary contusions
and labile hypotension.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.140
Which could also be caused
from a splenic fracture.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.542
Carter, I'd like
an aortagram,
better yet, a T.E.E.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.877
The fact that he's still alive
argues against aortic injury.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.612
Page me with the result, okay?

17:59.646 --> 18:01.548
Elizabeth, I really think
there's more to discuss here.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.283
Kerry, I'm a trauma surgeon.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.552
Last time I checked,
you weren't chief of staff.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.521
Keep me apprised
of his condition.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.323
Okay, the last one.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.824
Can I go see him now?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.793
No. We have to make sure
you didn't bruise your heart

18:13.826 --> 18:15.328
or damage your lungs.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.696
They're not
doing anything.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.765
Probably just waiting
to go up to surgery.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.301
I'm sure he's stable.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.603
I told Mr. Chambers
we were ten minutes late.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.573
It's a trick I use
to get him to meetings on time.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.641
You don't call him
by his first name?

18:28.675 --> 18:30.410
He's kind of formal.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.445
How long have you been
working for him?

18:32.479 --> 18:34.647
Two years.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.549
Six days a week,
ten hours a day.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.686
I probably spend more time
with him than his wife does.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.654
They're really happy, though.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.523
I mean, she's
lucky to have him.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.559
He's a good man.

18:46.593 --> 18:47.860
You ready to irrigate?

18:47.894 --> 18:49.362
Yeah.

18:49.396 --> 18:52.299
Uh, put polysporin
on the wound.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.469
Where'd you
get that one?

18:56.503 --> 18:59.306
A low-life stuck me in the back
with a switchblade.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.674
An inch to the left
and you would have lost

19:01.708 --> 19:02.709
a kidney.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.345
The guy who did it to me...

19:05.378 --> 19:07.714
got snuffed with a sawed-off.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.316
( laughs )

19:09.349 --> 19:11.218
Dude was bite-size.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.552
That's funny?

19:12.585 --> 19:13.686
Whatever, bitch.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.688
Hey, watch your mouth.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.259
Are you almost done, man?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.293
Why?

19:20.327 --> 19:22.395
You in a hurry to go to jail?

19:22.429 --> 19:23.630
We can check
on Alma for you.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.698
She's probably
in recovery by now.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.667
That means she's okay then.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.837
No. She could wind up paralyzed.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.806
Like all over, or just her legs?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.542
They're not sure yet.

19:35.575 --> 19:39.646
Wow, better if they just
killed her, you know?

19:39.679 --> 19:42.315
An hour ago, you were ready
to get revenge.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.650
Yeah, that was personal.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.518
It was about my name, honor.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.387
But paralyzed, that blows.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.323
Just dress the wound
with adaptic.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.593
Hey, Luka.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.594
Huh?

19:54.627 --> 19:56.596
Piece of work, huh?

19:56.629 --> 19:58.265
Yeah.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.766
And she's pregnant.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.601
Who?

20:01.634 --> 20:02.802
The girl.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.437
Says it's his baby.

20:04.471 --> 20:07.640
You want to tell him?

20:07.674 --> 20:11.344
No. Do you?

20:11.378 --> 20:14.781
Not really.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.252
Hi. I'm Michael Gallant
from Psychiatry.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.687
Stella Willits,
from Ohio.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.755
Nice shiner.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.792
I understand you have
quite a few medical complaints.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.927
I'll need to ask you
a few questions.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.329
Knock yourself out, hon.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.763
Do you have any recent
weight gain?

20:30.797 --> 20:32.599
I've been thinking about
going on The Zone.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.334
How about dry skin?

20:34.367 --> 20:35.835
Like the Sahara.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.537
Here, give me this.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.571
( clears throat )

20:38.605 --> 20:39.839
"Intolerance to cold?" Yes.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.942
"Arthritis, sore muscles,
constipation?"

20:42.975 --> 20:44.711
Yes, yes and yes.

20:44.744 --> 20:50.383
"Fatigue?" Well, I have been
kind of low-energy lately.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.853
You have some delayed relaxation
from the deep tendon reflexes.

20:53.886 --> 20:56.756
What about depression?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.725
Me?

20:58.758 --> 20:59.326
Yeah.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.893
No.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.895
I'm glass half-full;
I'm a silver-lining girl.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.397
I'm an optimist.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.500
Listen, I'll be back
to finish.

21:07.534 --> 21:14.541
Um, I guess I do get
a little blue sometimes.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.443
WEAVER:
Get this gurney out of the way.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.944
If you haven't talked to anyone

21:17.977 --> 21:19.946
you need to go back
to the nurse in triage.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.048
Jing-Mei, your food
poisoning in Exam Four

21:22.081 --> 21:23.082
has been here
for 11 hours.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.717
Waiting on a consult.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.453
From who, the Naked Chef?
The guy ate bad shrimp.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.355
Hey, Dr. Weaver?
Can I get something
for my skin?

21:28.355 --> 21:29.522
Yeah, sunblock.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.057
Can I talk to you
about Stella Willits?

21:31.090 --> 21:33.360
Well, only if you're
admitting her to Psych.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.961
Yeah, she may have
a reason for...

21:34.994 --> 21:37.364
Just got word
on Mr. Chambers--
aortic dissection.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.865
I'm taking him up
to surgery now

21:38.898 --> 21:40.367
unless you have
any objections.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.868
Ah, no, but would
it be possible

21:41.901 --> 21:43.436
for us to speak
in private first?

21:43.470 --> 21:44.837
Of course.
Dr. Weaver...

21:44.871 --> 21:47.574
Later, Gallant.
Yeah, but I need...

21:47.607 --> 21:49.409
I wanted to talk to you

21:49.442 --> 21:51.578
about what happened earlier.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.980
Oh, for God's sake.
Who left a cadaver in here?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.882
Sasha's a bit of a
bad penny, I'm afraid.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.517
She keeps being
moved around

21:57.550 --> 21:59.386
while they try
to locate her family.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.754
I don't mind,
if you don't mind.

22:01.788 --> 22:07.627
I'm concerned that you might be
taking on too much, too soon.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.597
Particularly in the area
of trauma.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.432
Based on?

22:12.465 --> 22:14.000
What I saw earlier--

22:14.033 --> 22:17.570
a pronounced inability to work
with others

22:17.604 --> 22:20.006
a lack of professional respect.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.574
You're joking, right?

22:21.608 --> 22:23.843
Look, it's stressful,
no question.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.846
But copping an attitude
with me and my staff

22:26.879 --> 22:29.582
is-is not going to make
the trauma go any easier.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.484
Kerry, I saw
a dissected aorta.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.986
In fact, it only adds
to the intense pressure

22:34.020 --> 22:35.121
that we're all feeling.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.989
Given my position

22:37.023 --> 22:38.925
I didn't think it necessary
to come and seek your approval.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.860
We all have our sensitivities...

22:40.893 --> 22:44.564
Quite frankly, if anyone has
an attitude here, it's you.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.032
...but we can't let them
interfere...

22:46.065 --> 22:47.567
No, it's you.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.102
With your insistence
on being kowtowed to

22:50.136 --> 22:51.804
at every bloody opportunity.

22:51.838 --> 22:55.975
( crying )

22:57.510 --> 23:00.079
Oh, my God.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.781
( sniffling )

23:01.814 --> 23:04.083
( crying continuing )

23:04.116 --> 23:05.885
Excuse me.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.826
You have some milk?
I'm thirsty.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.127
His landlord
found him in
his apartment

23:15.161 --> 23:16.529
crying,
hyperventilating.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.030
Apparently, his
girlfriend left him.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.732
Well, the correct term would
be "Mommy."

23:19.766 --> 23:20.967
What?
Mommy.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.502
Well, he appears
to be an Abie.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.103
You know,
an adult baby.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.906
It's-it's a fetish in which
the baby is taken care of

23:26.939 --> 23:28.975
in every way
by a "mommy" or a "daddy."

23:29.008 --> 23:30.643
You're familiar
with this condition?

23:30.677 --> 23:32.144
Well, it's not really
a condition.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.713
It's more like a form
of relaxation.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.014
Are you
kidding me?

23:35.047 --> 23:37.884
No. It says right here

23:37.917 --> 23:39.686
get away
from their stressful lives.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.488
Mr. Dwyer, what do you do
for a living?

23:41.521 --> 23:42.589
Shoe sales.

23:42.622 --> 23:43.756
See, and a foot
fetish, too.

23:43.790 --> 23:44.924
This is definitely
an issue

23:44.957 --> 23:45.858
for the Psych
Department.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.026
No offense.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.861
No, no. I-I am not so sure
about that.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.163
Mr. Dwyer, when's the last time
someone changed you?

23:51.197 --> 23:53.132
This morning.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.534
More than likely

23:54.567 --> 23:56.035
he suffers from
a diaper rash

23:56.068 --> 23:57.737
which is a
medical ailment

23:57.770 --> 23:59.038
to be treated
by the ER.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.773
When are you done
with this rotation?

24:00.807 --> 24:02.141
Next week.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.943
Remind me to give you
some serious scut work.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.612
FRANK:
"To Dr. Pratt

24:05.645 --> 24:07.547
"Thanks from a grateful patient.

24:07.580 --> 24:08.715
Ken, the Kiosk Man."

24:08.748 --> 24:10.049
Amazing.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.984
Too bad this guy didn't
run a hot dog stand.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.520
I'm here for allergies

24:13.520 --> 24:15.588
and these things are pushing me
over the edge.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.023
Can you get rid of them?

24:17.056 --> 24:18.725
Yeah, or give them to someone
a little more deserving.

24:18.758 --> 24:19.892
Hey, hey, hey.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.594
Who saved flower
boy's foot

24:21.628 --> 24:23.095
and moved more
patients than
anybody today?

24:23.129 --> 24:24.196
Me, that's who.

24:24.230 --> 24:25.565
And you know what?

24:25.598 --> 24:26.799
You guys are going
to miss me, too

24:26.833 --> 24:28.200
'cause I'm
out of here.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.202
Bankers hours, Pratt?
Only if they
work doubles.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.771
Hey, Carter,
what's up with your boss?

24:31.804 --> 24:32.839
Is it true

24:32.872 --> 24:34.006
she was, uh,
crying earlier?

24:34.040 --> 24:35.207
Weaver?

24:35.241 --> 24:36.709
Yeah. Bad breakup
or something?

24:36.743 --> 24:37.877
She's been pretty
moody lately.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.178
Lately?

24:39.211 --> 24:40.847
HARKINS:
I'm sorry,
but I think

24:40.880 --> 24:42.248
this man needs
immediate attention!

24:42.281 --> 24:44.183
You got to help my Pops.
What happened?

24:44.216 --> 24:46.018
They came in through
the ambulance entrance way

24:46.052 --> 24:47.854
and I saw right away
that he was diaphoretic.

24:47.887 --> 24:48.721
I'm not
asking you.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.122
We were playing ball

24:50.156 --> 24:51.758
and he just grabbed his chest
and sat down.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.560
When did the
pain start?
About an hour ago.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.995
I thought it would go away.
You having pain
anywhere else?

24:56.028 --> 24:57.764
Come on.
On a scale of one to
ten, how's your pain?

24:57.797 --> 24:58.965
40.
How are you
feeling?

24:58.998 --> 25:00.667
Talk to the elephant
on my chest.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.301
It could be an acute MI.
Excuse me,
do you mind?

25:02.334 --> 25:04.303
What are your names?
I'm Pete and
he's Derek.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.806
What's up?
Can you take Pete
and Derek to the TV room?

25:06.839 --> 25:07.907
One, Pratt.
Okay, come on.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.175
Excuse me, is there any way

25:09.208 --> 25:10.877
that we can wait
in the doctor's lounge?

25:10.910 --> 25:12.712
As soon as
you're a doctor.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.080
Tombstones in two,
three and "F."

25:14.113 --> 25:16.215
Is it any better with the spray
under your tongue?

25:16.248 --> 25:18.084
No. W-what do you mean
by "tombstones"?

25:18.117 --> 25:19.619
It's a non-medical way

25:19.652 --> 25:21.120
of describing the line tracings
on your EKG

25:21.153 --> 25:22.955
but it's not good news,
Mr. Royston.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.924
It looks like
you're having a heart attack.

25:24.957 --> 25:25.892
How about
aspirin?

25:25.925 --> 25:26.993
I already gave him 80.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.595
Let's push five of metoprolol.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.329
Titrate morphine.
Start heparin and nitro drips.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.598
Call cards and the cath lab.

25:31.598 --> 25:32.599
Wait. What's going on?

25:32.599 --> 25:33.766
What's he going to do?

25:33.800 --> 25:35.034
You have a blocked
heart vessel.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.737
If we can open it
up with a balloon

25:37.770 --> 25:38.905
We just need your permission
to do the procedure.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.006
It's called "angioplasty."

25:40.039 --> 25:41.741
If you can sign for me
right there.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.743
Cath lab will
be ready for him
in 30 minutes.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.745
He's a hot MI.
Yeah, they're
finishing up a pacer.

25:45.778 --> 25:46.713
While they're messing around

25:46.746 --> 25:47.814
with an elective procedure

25:47.847 --> 25:49.081
he's killing off heart cells.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.617
We've got plenty of time
to medicate...

25:50.617 --> 25:51.918
( alarm rings )
V-Tach.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.052
Like I said...
Charge the
paddles at 200.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.220
No pulse.
Starting compressions.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.789
Abby, open an
intubation tray.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.190
Let's get cardiology in here.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.058
And clear.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.262
The doctors there will
give you antibiotics.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.131
Just make sure to get
a wound check in two days.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.365
Right.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.834
So, he's
good to go?
Yup.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.168
Later, I guess.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.136
She's pregnant.

26:10.169 --> 26:10.970
Who?

26:11.003 --> 26:12.639
Your girlfriend.

26:12.672 --> 26:13.840
I told you, man.
She's not my
girlfriend.

26:13.873 --> 26:15.341
¿Tu entiendes, hermano?

26:15.374 --> 26:17.810
Well, whoever she is to you,
she's carrying your baby.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.013
Why don't you care?

26:21.047 --> 26:23.115
Why do you?

26:30.790 --> 26:32.124
CARTER:
360 again.

26:32.158 --> 26:33.660
Clear.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.996
Still fib.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.097
Is this my consults?

26:38.130 --> 26:39.699
Mm-hmm.
Acute inferior MI.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.668
Refractory v-fib despite
lidocaine and procainamide.

26:41.668 --> 26:42.401
How about a TNK?

26:42.434 --> 26:43.402
Sure as hell isn't going

26:43.435 --> 26:45.037
to make it to the cath lab.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.006
I've been pounding
on his sternum for ten minutes.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.908
He'll bleed out
with thrombolytics.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.042
Who's talking?

26:50.076 --> 26:51.177
Pratt-- first
year resident.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.278
Then shut up.

26:53.780 --> 26:54.681
CPR as a contraindication

26:54.681 --> 26:55.782
to thrombolytics has

26:55.815 --> 26:57.750
been debunked.
It's a myth.

26:57.784 --> 26:58.250
40 of
tenecteplase.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.351
IV push.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.320
Charging to 360.
And clear.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.889
A boatload
from Lake Michigan

27:02.922 --> 27:04.323
just came in
with alcohol
poisoning.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.224
Kids?

27:05.257 --> 27:06.893
Worse. Parents.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.895
The ten-year-old was the only
one sober enough to dock.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.129
Do you think
it's too late

27:10.162 --> 27:11.330
to go into
Dermatology?

27:11.363 --> 27:12.965
Excuse me,
Doctor?
Yes.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.701
I had a message
on my voice mail

27:14.734 --> 27:16.803
that said my daughter was
in a motorcycle accident.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.170
Her name is Sasha--
Sasha Huffner.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.906
Uh, yeah, yeah.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.140
I'll, uh, check on her
for you.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.308
Thank you.
Just wait right there.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.242
Thank you very much.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.011
( sighs )

27:25.044 --> 27:26.779
Susan, did you
order a urine
tox screen on... ?

27:26.813 --> 27:28.180
Check my orders.
Elizabeth?

27:28.214 --> 27:30.850
HALEH:
Dr. Lewis, this guy
with the ringworm...

27:30.883 --> 27:33.319
Yeah, can you hang on
a second? Elizabeth?

27:33.352 --> 27:35.121
And an abdominal CT
with contrast

27:35.154 --> 27:37.189
and two grams
of Cefotetan.

27:37.223 --> 27:38.324
Can we talk?

27:38.357 --> 27:39.726
I'm on my way to the OR

27:39.759 --> 27:41.160
with a bowel obstruction
if it can wait.

27:41.193 --> 27:43.262
Sasha Huffner's
father is here.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.296
Your first patient.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.397
The DOA.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.966
Right, right.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.335
Look, if you want, I
can tell him for you.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.203
Why would I want that?
I don't know.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.805
You're on your
way to surgery.

27:52.839 --> 27:53.873
It's kind of
depressing.

27:53.906 --> 27:54.841
What's his name?

27:54.874 --> 27:55.474
Paul. He's staying...

27:55.507 --> 27:57.977
I'll find him.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.081
KAYSON:
Hold compressions.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.115
CARTER:
Five v-fib.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.151
Resuming
compressions.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.185
KAYSON:
How long has it been?

28:06.218 --> 28:08.254
LOCKHART:
42 minutes.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.288
Okay, that's it.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.090
Call it.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.291
You can stop now.

28:14.193 --> 28:17.296
Time of death is... 7:11.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.464
( alarms sound )

28:18.497 --> 28:20.299
KAYSON:
Wife here?

28:20.332 --> 28:22.802
She's on
her way.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.138
You should still wait.

28:26.172 --> 28:28.240
Can't lie to him now.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.880
You want
to turn off that monitor?

28:35.181 --> 28:37.183
Whoa! He's in V-tach.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.350
What?

28:38.384 --> 28:40.252
I can shock that.

28:40.286 --> 28:41.520
They pronounced him.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.222
Yeah, well, now
he's got a good rhythm.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.891
200. Clear.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.093
Yeah, still V-tach.
That's enough, Pratt.

28:47.126 --> 28:48.294
Bag him.
No.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.929
Do it!
No, he's dead.

28:49.962 --> 28:52.231
300. Clear.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.400
Oh, my God.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.368
PRATT:
Sinus tach.

28:56.402 --> 28:59.171
I said bag him.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.343
CARTER:
We did everything
that we could.

29:04.376 --> 29:07.479
We had three doctors
working on him

29:07.513 --> 29:09.481
for over an hour.

29:09.515 --> 29:10.549
We gave him
medicine

29:10.582 --> 29:12.084
and we shocked
his heart

29:12.118 --> 29:13.352
but it didn't
do any good.

29:13.385 --> 29:14.821
Why not?

29:14.821 --> 29:17.123
Because his heart
was very, very sick

29:17.156 --> 29:20.026
and it was too
sick to save.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.261
I shouldn't have
made him play ball.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.864
I mean, he said
he was tired.

29:24.897 --> 29:25.965
No, no. It's
not your fault.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.399
It's not your fault.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.435
Your dad had a problem
that nobody knew about.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.303
Not you,
not your mom

29:31.337 --> 29:33.272
and not even him.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.341
In fact, you
gave him the best
possible chance

29:35.374 --> 29:37.844
that he had by
getting him to
the hospital.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.045
He can't be dead.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.247
I'm sorry, Pete.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.348
He is dead.

29:42.381 --> 29:43.449
And it's very sad

29:43.482 --> 29:46.485
and it's very
unexpected.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.354
And it's okay
to cry.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.924
It's just a sign
of how much you
loved your dad.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.264
Do you guys
want to see him?

29:58.297 --> 30:00.332
You can say good-bye.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.103
Yeah.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.472
Okay.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.409
You need to know

30:10.442 --> 30:13.212
that your dad's going to have
a lot of tubes attached to him

30:13.245 --> 30:14.513
and it might be a little scary.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.149
That's okay.

30:17.183 --> 30:18.484
PRATT:
Keep the lidocaine

30:18.517 --> 30:20.319
at two milligrams
per minute.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.287
What are you doing?

30:21.320 --> 30:22.621
I got him back.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.324
What the hell's going on?

30:25.357 --> 30:27.259
B.P.'s 90 palp.
He's back.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.494
He's alive?

30:28.527 --> 30:30.096
He's not dead.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.397
Daddy's alive!

30:36.135 --> 30:37.369
Mr. Huffner?

30:37.403 --> 30:38.404
Yes.

30:38.437 --> 30:39.605
I'm Dr. Corday.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.307
I'm a surgeon
here at County

30:41.340 --> 30:43.876
and I was your
daughter's
physician

30:43.910 --> 30:45.177
this morning.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.345
Did you operate on her?

30:46.378 --> 30:48.080
I mean, is she all right?

30:48.114 --> 30:50.316
I mean

30:50.349 --> 30:51.483
where is she?

30:51.517 --> 30:53.552
Can I see her?

30:53.585 --> 30:57.189
I'm afraid your
daughter died
this morning.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.426
She-she came in
essentially DOA

31:00.459 --> 31:02.161
with massive
internal injuries

31:02.194 --> 31:04.931
from a motorcycle
accident.

31:04.931 --> 31:08.234
My God.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.637
Someone can take
you to see the body.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.006
We've kept it in
the department
for your benefit.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.541
And, uh...
afterwards

31:15.574 --> 31:18.310
you can make
arrangements
with the morgue.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.049
A nurse can give
you information

31:23.082 --> 31:25.617
about grief
counseling.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.188
She's my little baby.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.190
Is she gone?

31:32.358 --> 31:35.027
I'm sorry.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.336
( crying )

31:47.406 --> 31:49.241
KAYSON:
Nobody walks out

31:49.275 --> 31:51.410
of a hospital
after 40 minutes of CPR.

31:51.443 --> 31:52.711
CARTER:
There was improvement.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.446
From v-fib to v-tach.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.582
KAYSON:
Because he's either dead
or should be dead

31:56.615 --> 31:58.684
which means your resident is
either cruel, stupid or both.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.086
He saw a
shockable
rhythm

32:00.119 --> 32:01.253
in the setting
of thrombolytics.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.989
It could have
taken 30 minutes

32:02.989 --> 32:04.523
for the TNK
to open up the
coronary artery.

32:04.556 --> 32:06.025
Are you defending this?

32:06.058 --> 32:07.559
He had to make a
split-second decision

32:07.593 --> 32:09.028
and he thought
he was acting

32:09.061 --> 32:10.496
in the best interest
of his patient.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.132
Well, he was wrong,
and now we have a vegetable

32:13.165 --> 32:14.533
with a pulse on our hands.

32:14.566 --> 32:17.103
Well, our names are
on the chart, not yours.

32:17.136 --> 32:18.604
Dr. Pratt and
I will take

32:18.637 --> 32:21.140
full responsibility
for any negative outcome.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.075
Oh, you bet your ass you will.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.521
Hey, um...

32:35.554 --> 32:38.090
I just want to say thanks
for backing me up like that.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.094
A chief resident

32:42.128 --> 32:43.329
and a cardiologist

32:43.362 --> 32:45.131
with more than 25
years of experience

32:45.164 --> 32:47.366
pronounce a man dead

32:47.399 --> 32:49.235
and you decide to resurrect him.

32:49.268 --> 32:50.602
Yes, but just
like you say...

32:50.636 --> 32:52.738
You think I defended
you because I like you

32:52.771 --> 32:54.406
or because I
approve of the way

32:54.440 --> 32:55.641
that you practice medicine?

32:55.674 --> 32:57.109
You are my responsibility.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.077
You are my job.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.678
And I'm doing mine.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.180
If you wanted to shock

33:01.213 --> 33:02.414
you could have stat paged me
overhead.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.350
I could have been
here in a second

33:04.383 --> 33:06.318
and we could
have discussed it.

33:06.352 --> 33:07.519
Instead,
you go off

33:07.553 --> 33:09.588
without any regard
for authority

33:09.621 --> 33:11.090
or even the best interest
of your patient.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.524
Now, that's not true.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.126
The guy's got kids,
he's got a wife.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.327
I was trying to save him...

33:15.361 --> 33:16.328
You brought
the man back

33:16.362 --> 33:18.297
Pratt, because you felt like it.

33:20.066 --> 33:23.069
Because you wanted to see
if you could.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.620
Why is he still sleeping?

33:41.653 --> 33:44.623
He didn't get enough
oxygen to the brain

33:44.656 --> 33:48.294
so we have to wait and
see if he wakes up.

33:48.327 --> 33:51.597
You know, there's a
chance he might not.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.099
Why's that?

33:53.099 --> 33:55.801
He's just taking
a nap is all.

33:55.834 --> 33:59.571
Pete, your dad's
still pretty sick.

33:59.605 --> 34:03.675
Yeah, but you
saved his life.

34:07.113 --> 34:08.813
Hey, you guys hungry?

34:08.847 --> 34:10.748
Come on, let's go down
to the cafeteria.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.118
I'll get you something to eat.

34:12.118 --> 34:14.120
All right?

34:17.422 --> 34:19.491
My daddy doesn't
like doctors

34:19.525 --> 34:21.793
but I bet
he'd like you.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.699
You tired?

34:28.734 --> 34:31.270
There's got to be
a better word for it.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.139
Enervated?

34:33.139 --> 34:34.139
Asthenic? Atonic?

34:34.139 --> 34:34.806
Pooped?

34:34.840 --> 34:36.375
Bingo.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.444
Does that mean you want
to stay home tonight?

34:38.476 --> 34:39.811
Not necessarily.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.313
Anything in particular
come to mind?

34:42.348 --> 34:43.882
Shoot, keep working
that spot

34:43.915 --> 34:45.751
and I'll do
whatever you want.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.654
You know, I do need my
sock drawer reorganized.

34:48.687 --> 34:51.623
They told me
my husband was back here.

34:51.657 --> 34:52.658
He had a heart attack.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.293
( clears throat )

34:54.326 --> 34:55.627
Mrs. Royston?

34:55.661 --> 34:59.265
Even though we got his
heart beating again

34:59.298 --> 35:00.899
the neurologic test showed

35:00.932 --> 35:04.436
that there's a lack
of basic brain function.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.438
What that means is that...

35:06.472 --> 35:09.808
I know what it means.

35:12.278 --> 35:15.414
How long can he last
like this?

35:15.447 --> 35:18.684
Indefinitely.

35:21.220 --> 35:24.356
Did your husband
leave any instructions?

35:24.390 --> 35:26.825
Did he ever express
his wishes

35:26.858 --> 35:30.729
about what should be done
in a situation like this?

35:30.762 --> 35:33.699
He's 42 years old.

35:35.767 --> 35:38.837
Then I need to ask you
if his heart stops beating again

35:38.870 --> 35:41.740
do you want heroic measures
taken to save his life

35:41.773 --> 35:44.810
or do you want to sign
a Do Not Resuscitate order?

35:44.843 --> 35:48.847
Oh... God...

35:51.417 --> 35:54.720
Is that the right
thing to do?

35:56.655 --> 36:00.692
I can't make that decision
for you.

36:00.726 --> 36:06.232
Is it the right thing to do?

36:06.232 --> 36:08.667
Yes.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.772
I want to thank you,
Dr. Gallant.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.674
There is no need,
Mrs. Teasley, no need.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.543
I just get...
well, I don't know

36:17.576 --> 36:18.877
panicky in
public places.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.512
Well, you know

36:20.546 --> 36:23.249
that's why you need
to keep taking your Klonopin.

36:23.249 --> 36:24.750
I hope I wasn't
too much trouble.

36:24.783 --> 36:27.686
Oh, not at all.
Not at all.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.255
Gallant,
you want to explain

36:29.288 --> 36:30.822
why Stella's still here?

36:30.856 --> 36:32.858
Yeah. I'm waiting on some
lab work that I ordered.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.493
Well, who said
you could order labs?

36:34.526 --> 36:35.861
No one, but
I thought that...

36:35.894 --> 36:37.496
You're here to assess
her psychiatric problems

36:37.529 --> 36:39.265
not to do a
medical work-up.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.633
Listen, I-I realize that,
but I think she is really sick.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.269
You looking for these?

36:43.269 --> 36:44.403
What?

36:44.436 --> 36:45.904
Oh, her TSH level
is over 100.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.839
Stella?

36:47.873 --> 36:49.608
Well, she's hypothyroid which
explains all of her symptoms:

36:49.641 --> 36:50.976
depression, fatigue...

36:51.009 --> 36:52.778
Yeah, but not the fact
that she's a con artist

36:52.811 --> 36:53.945
and a hypochondriac.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.281
Until your rotation is over

36:55.314 --> 36:56.515
you are not a member
of this E.R.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.849
You have to stop doing
our work;

36:57.883 --> 36:59.918
start doing the work
of your current department.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.287
Yes, ma'am.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.588
But good catch.
You off soon?

37:02.621 --> 37:03.622
In a few minutes, yep.

37:03.655 --> 37:04.723
Do me a favor.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.293
Discharge Stella
before you leave.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.828
I feel like crap.
I'm going home.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.597
Yeah, we sent the, uh,
labs out this morning.

37:11.630 --> 37:12.931
Well, she's been here
for 24 hours...

37:12.964 --> 37:16.802
Something's wrong
with my dad! Come on.

37:16.835 --> 37:20.739
Hey, Pratt, will
you get in here?

37:20.772 --> 37:22.574
Mama, what's wrong?

37:22.608 --> 37:24.643
Mrs. Royston,
did you sign the DNR?

37:24.676 --> 37:26.044
You got to
help my dad.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.813
He's in arrest.

37:27.846 --> 37:32.484
Mrs. Royston,
did you sign the DNR?

37:32.518 --> 37:33.519
Okay.

37:33.552 --> 37:34.753
What's a DNR?

37:34.786 --> 37:37.689
Um... it-it means
that your dad

37:37.723 --> 37:40.892
is too sick
for us to try to help him.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.394
Why can't you?

37:42.428 --> 37:43.762
Because he's already gone,
baby.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.764
No, he's not!

37:45.797 --> 37:47.633
No, he's not.

37:47.666 --> 37:48.867
He saved him.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.803
He said he was going
to be okay.

37:51.837 --> 37:52.904
Derek, we tried.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.806
Why are you
letting him die?!

37:54.840 --> 37:57.075
Baby, please...

37:57.108 --> 37:58.477
You got to help!

37:58.510 --> 38:00.846
Mama, tell them
to do something, please.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.581
( whispering ):
Come on, come on.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.782
( whimpering ):
No...

38:03.815 --> 38:05.717
Why are you doing this?

38:05.751 --> 38:07.018
LOCKHART:
Asystole.

38:09.821 --> 38:12.491
Why?

38:15.794 --> 38:16.995
( sobbing )

38:17.028 --> 38:18.096
Daddy?

38:18.129 --> 38:19.798
( both crying )

38:24.836 --> 38:25.604
Rominger's not an appy.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.373
You sure?

38:27.373 --> 38:28.774
25 male, periumbilical to
the right lower quadrant?

38:28.807 --> 38:30.509
He's a poster boy.

38:30.542 --> 38:32.644
Well, you can bring him back
in 12 hours if you want.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.413
Oh, uh, Dr. Lewis asked
that you take a look

38:34.446 --> 38:35.481
at the
cholecystitis.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.648
Page the next shift.

38:36.682 --> 38:37.949
Do you want to take
a call from Neuro?

38:37.983 --> 38:39.117
Find out if
it's urgent.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.386
You forgot
to sign off.

38:40.386 --> 38:41.620
Oh.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.121
So, uh,
how are you feeling?

38:43.154 --> 38:45.791
It's about the GSW
you handled earlier--

38:45.824 --> 38:46.958
Alma Salazar?

38:46.992 --> 38:48.727
I'm fine.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.762
You wanted to know
her status.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.764
What is it?

38:52.798 --> 38:54.400
You going to tell me?

38:54.400 --> 38:56.034
She's a quad.

39:06.812 --> 39:09.080
( sighs wearily )

39:40.746 --> 39:42.748
Hey.

40:25.691 --> 40:26.725
Hi.

40:26.758 --> 40:27.926
Shh.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.128
Oh. You're not going
to wake him up?

40:30.161 --> 40:31.630
Nah.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.832
Didn't you two
come in together?

40:33.865 --> 40:37.068
Yeah, I'm sure he can
find his way home without me.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.904
Do you need
a lift then?

40:38.937 --> 40:40.872
No, thanks.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.474
Have a good night.

40:46.244 --> 40:48.179
( hooting and cheering )

40:48.213 --> 40:49.748
MAN:
I can't believe that!

40:49.781 --> 40:51.650
( joyful chattering
and laughter )

40:51.683 --> 40:52.951
Ah, man!

40:52.984 --> 40:55.186
Why do you even try, son,
why do you even try?

40:55.220 --> 40:56.722
Yo, man, I don't know.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.557
This is just crazy!

40:58.590 --> 40:59.891
Man, they evacuating
the whole spot?

40:59.925 --> 41:01.593
Hey, yo.
What's all this?

41:01.627 --> 41:02.561
Pay-per-view.

41:02.594 --> 41:03.929
Want some pizza?

41:03.962 --> 41:05.731
Yo, Biz, let me talk to you
for a minute.

41:05.764 --> 41:06.898
Yo, I'm watching
a movie, man.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.099
Dawgs, if I got
to come over there

41:08.133 --> 41:09.835
I'm gonna smack fire at you!

41:09.868 --> 41:12.270
Come here, man,
let me talk to
you for a minute!

41:12.303 --> 41:13.539
Come on, man,
hurry up!

41:13.572 --> 41:14.740
Come here, man.

41:14.773 --> 41:16.107
Damn, what's
your problem?

41:16.141 --> 41:20.278
I thought I told you
don't come here again.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.613
Stay away from him.

41:21.647 --> 41:22.914
You understand that?

41:22.948 --> 41:25.817
Yo, I'm saying,
now you his mama, yo?

41:25.851 --> 41:27.285
What...?

41:27.318 --> 41:28.720
( shouting )

41:28.754 --> 41:29.821
Yo, man, chill out.

41:29.855 --> 41:30.789
You hear what
I'm saying?

41:30.822 --> 41:31.723
Why you tripping?

41:31.757 --> 41:33.124
Don't play with me, man.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.860
All right, that's it,
party's over.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.161
Everybody out!

41:36.194 --> 41:38.029
Come on, man, get up.
You two, get up.

41:38.063 --> 41:40.298
All y'all.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.967
Get up and
get out.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.569
Yo, my man,
are you stupid?

41:43.602 --> 41:44.836
Come here.

41:44.870 --> 41:46.705
Come on, man, come on,
come on, come on.

41:46.738 --> 41:47.973
What you doing, G?
Come on, get out.

41:48.006 --> 41:48.874
Close the door
behind you.

41:48.907 --> 41:50.609
What's wrong, G?

41:50.642 --> 41:52.944
Y'all, I'll holler
at y'all later, all right?

41:52.978 --> 41:54.112
Those are my friends, G.

41:54.145 --> 41:56.915
Yeah? Well, this is my house.

41:59.918 --> 42:01.219
It's mine, too.

42:01.252 --> 42:02.588
Oh, yeah?

42:02.588 --> 42:03.321
Oh, what,
you pay rent?

42:03.354 --> 42:04.956
Come on,
watch out, man.

42:04.990 --> 42:08.193
No. Does that mean I
can't have no friends?

42:08.226 --> 42:09.628
Just be quiet,
I'm tired.

42:09.661 --> 42:10.862
Man, you tired,
all right.

42:10.896 --> 42:14.132
Grouchy, too.

42:16.935 --> 42:18.737
Leon...

42:18.770 --> 42:21.607
you know those guys
are just using you, right?

42:21.640 --> 42:22.974
Hmm?

42:23.008 --> 42:26.912
Yo, dawg, how do they
blow up a whole town

42:26.945 --> 42:29.981
like that without
killing anybody?

42:30.015 --> 42:31.082
They don't.

42:31.116 --> 42:33.218
And if you shot the gun
that close

42:33.251 --> 42:35.186
he'd blow
his eardrums out, too.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.222
Oh, gee, it's just
a movie, man.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.958
You don't got to
take it so seriously.

42:39.991 --> 42:41.927
Hey, whatever.

42:41.960 --> 42:45.631
But she's hot, though.

42:45.631 --> 42:46.798
Most definitely.

42:46.832 --> 42:47.966
( laughing )

42:47.999 --> 42:49.367
You're right
about that, G.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.803
Yo, you still
want some pizza?

42:54.906 --> 42:56.642
( sighs )

43:01.880 --> 43:04.149
( moans )

43:06.017 --> 43:07.853
( coughs )

43:07.886 --> 43:09.688
( clears throat )

43:15.093 --> 43:16.828
Hey, sleeping beauty.

43:16.862 --> 43:18.997
How long have I
been in there?

43:19.030 --> 43:20.932
Since before
my shift started.

43:20.966 --> 43:22.067
Is Abby here?

43:22.100 --> 43:24.903
Nope, but she left you
a Post-It.

43:24.936 --> 43:27.839
And you still have
a med student waiting for you.

43:30.742 --> 43:33.011
( sputtering lips )

43:34.145 --> 43:35.180
Hey.

43:35.213 --> 43:36.682
( grunts )

43:36.715 --> 43:37.849
Look, I'm sorry.

43:37.883 --> 43:39.350
The day just kind of
got away from me.

43:39.384 --> 43:40.819
Why don't we try
again tomorrow?

43:40.852 --> 43:43.789
No. No, I don't
think so. No.

43:43.822 --> 43:46.391
I have been here
for 16 hours.

43:46.424 --> 43:48.694
I have been ignored
and yelled at

43:48.694 --> 43:51.296
and called honey
and sweetie and bitch-- twice.

43:51.329 --> 43:52.998
I don't smell good

43:53.031 --> 43:56.001
and all I've had to eat
is Gummy Bears and Diet Coke.

43:56.034 --> 43:57.936
I'm not leaving
until I get

43:57.969 --> 43:59.337
what I came for.

44:04.075 --> 44:05.376
This the Admit Area.

44:05.410 --> 44:07.245
This is the center
of the E.R. universe.

44:07.278 --> 44:09.314
This is where you'll pick
up your patients' charts

44:09.347 --> 44:10.949
order labs, spend
the bulk of your life

44:10.982 --> 44:12.317
for the next
three months...

44:12.350 --> 44:14.085
Uh, how do you know
who's next to be seen?

44:14.119 --> 44:15.386
You check that chart
rack right there.

44:15.420 --> 44:17.255
We see people in the
order they arrive

44:17.288 --> 44:19.825
unless the triage
nurse feels they're
of high acuity

44:19.858 --> 44:21.727
and then they get moved
to the head of the line.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.194
Do you get to suture?

44:23.228 --> 44:24.996
If you're supervised
by an attending, yes.
