WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:05.609
We are celebrating the union
of Zorn, Defender of Zephyria,

00:05.644 --> 00:07.978
Conqueror of the Tribes of Agon,

00:08.013 --> 00:10.147
Decapitator of the
Dark Herdsmen of Grith,

00:10.182 --> 00:13.016
to Edie...
Bennett.

00:13.052 --> 00:16.720
So, by the power bestowed
by the god of war,

00:16.755 --> 00:19.322
- I pronounce...
- I oppose this union.

00:23.462 --> 00:28.265
- Sir Pent.
- You can't marry... a dead woman.

00:30.236 --> 00:32.069
_

00:35.130 --> 00:38.053
I'm sorry, honey. I know I
promised not to disembowel

00:38.054 --> 00:40.777
anyone at our wedding, but he
was about to explode your head.

00:40.813 --> 00:42.813
<i>I love you, babe.</i>

00:42.848 --> 00:45.415
See?
I'm glad we watched that.

00:45.451 --> 00:46.583
That's exactly how I want
my hair for our ceremony.

00:46.619 --> 00:48.719
So, we're not
gonna talk about how Zorn

00:48.754 --> 00:50.854
just saved you from a
murderous snake person

00:50.890 --> 00:51.989
at your own wedding?

00:52.024 --> 00:55.192
Oh, he was just an ex.
We went on, like, three dates.

00:55.227 --> 00:57.327
Four if you count
the initial kidnapping.

00:57.363 --> 01:01.098
You know, I've never seen
you look at me that way.

01:01.133 --> 01:03.000
Would you call this
a French braid?

01:03.035 --> 01:04.768
- No, that's a Dutch braid.
- Hmm.

01:04.803 --> 01:07.738
I'd like to see Zorn
correctly identify a braid.

01:07.773 --> 01:09.340
<i>I love you, Edie, and,</i>

01:09.341 --> 01:12.455
<i>- hey, I love your Dutch braid.
- Son of a...</i>

01:17.656 --> 01:20.223
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

01:20.486 --> 01:23.420
- Hey, Alan.
- Oh, hey, Layla. What's up?

01:23.455 --> 01:25.589
I'm plant sitting for my aunt.
She's away this week,

01:25.624 --> 01:28.058
and I was just wondering
if maybe you wanted

01:28.093 --> 01:30.260
to come over tomorrow
and hang out.

01:30.296 --> 01:32.563
Totally, yeah.
Plants and no aunts?

01:32.598 --> 01:34.398
That sounds like my kind
of a party.

01:34.433 --> 01:36.066
Cool. Well, I'll text you
the address.

01:36.101 --> 01:38.201
Cool.

01:38.237 --> 01:40.804
Oh, uh, by the way,
it's-it's a beach house, so...

01:40.839 --> 01:43.507
- bring your swimsuit.
- Beach house?

01:43.542 --> 01:46.610
- See you later.
- Yup.

01:52.027 --> 01:54.661
<i>Wait, isn't Dr. Klorpins in Zephyria?</i>

01:54.697 --> 01:56.897
Yeah, well, that's what he wants
the FBI to think, too...

01:56.932 --> 01:59.966
and the CIA...
and Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

02:00.002 --> 02:02.235
Zorn.
You're looking well.

02:02.271 --> 02:04.337
Someone must be taking
his fish person oil.

02:04.373 --> 02:07.941
Keeps the muscles tight
and the mind focused on eggs.

02:07.976 --> 02:09.675
That is actually why I'm here.

02:09.711 --> 02:11.478
Well, there's a fish guy
in room two.

02:11.513 --> 02:14.948
- Go on. Take a suck on his oil hole.
- All right.

02:14.983 --> 02:17.617
And this time maybe I'll let
the fish guy return the favor.

02:22.424 --> 02:25.726
Uh, hey, Dr. Klorpins,
what-what is, uh, Zephyritol?

02:25.761 --> 02:28.662
Oh, it's just a drug
that changes Zephyrian bodies

02:28.697 --> 02:30.831
so that they look
like regular bodies.

02:30.866 --> 02:32.132
And that really works?

02:32.167 --> 02:33.934
Like on any body part?
I don't know,

02:33.969 --> 02:35.802
just like a random example,
what about legs?

02:35.838 --> 02:39.840
Well, does Blake Lively look like
she has tentacles under her skirt?

02:39.875 --> 02:42.075
Then I guess it works.

02:42.111 --> 02:44.010
Hey, uh, do you think
I could have some?

02:44.046 --> 02:46.847
Sure, I got some free samples
here somewhere.

02:46.882 --> 02:49.750
Let's see, scalpel...
oh, pus kit... ow!

02:49.785 --> 02:53.653
There's got to be a better place
to store old, dirty needles.

02:53.689 --> 02:55.021
Here you go, squirt.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.592
Ooh, all right, well, just give
me my flu shot and a lollipop,

02:58.627 --> 02:59.960
and let's get
the hell out of here.

03:07.136 --> 03:09.035
Craig. Did you hear that?

03:09.071 --> 03:11.938
Does this look like the face
of someone who didn't hear that?

03:11.974 --> 03:13.073
You want to go check it out?

03:13.108 --> 03:15.375
Does this feel like
the heartbeat of someone

03:15.410 --> 03:17.244
who wants to go
check something out?

03:17.279 --> 03:18.678
Oh.

03:18.714 --> 03:20.313
Okay, we've got to do something.

03:20.349 --> 03:22.415
Okay, um,
let's just stay in bed,

03:22.451 --> 03:24.985
and if the murderer comes
in here, then I'll-I'll, like,

03:25.020 --> 03:26.686
distract him with a cloud
of feathers,

03:26.722 --> 03:29.656
and you make a run for it.

03:31.760 --> 03:32.726
What are you doing?

03:32.761 --> 03:35.962
- Nothing. I just texted Zorn.
- Okay, well, fine.

03:35.998 --> 03:38.131
We'll just call Zorn,
let him swoop in,

03:38.167 --> 03:40.000
and I'll just sit here
and be useless.

03:40.035 --> 03:41.067
Ooh.

03:41.103 --> 03:43.704
Well, looks like it was
a branch hitting your window.

03:43.705 --> 03:46.673
Don't worry, though.
I hacked it off, uprooted the tree,

03:46.708 --> 03:48.842
and salted the earth so nothing
can ever grow there again.

03:48.877 --> 03:50.677
Oh, I can break a stick, Edie.

03:50.712 --> 03:52.312
If I had known
that was the problem,

03:52.347 --> 03:54.114
I would've taken
care of it myself.

03:54.149 --> 03:55.849
Oh, I know you would've, sweetie.

03:55.884 --> 03:58.766
Hey, just so you
know, Craig, she's lying.

03:58.801 --> 04:02.622
Yeah, well, just so you know,
Zorn, you could be mean.

04:08.897 --> 04:10.530
I hate to sound
like such a dreamer,

04:10.566 --> 04:12.465
but there's got to be a
better way to shred documents.

04:12.501 --> 04:16.236
Actually, the machine you use
to make your smoothies

04:16.271 --> 04:19.673
- is technically a paper...
- Todd! No one likes a know-it-all.

04:20.642 --> 04:23.844
Zorn. Hey, hey,
didn't you get my memo?

04:23.879 --> 04:28.849
Hey, Blake Erickson,
the CEO of Sanitation Solutions,

04:28.884 --> 04:31.084
is coming in from Houston
to visit our branch.

04:31.119 --> 04:33.353
So I need everyone,
especially you,

04:33.388 --> 04:35.055
to be on their best behavior.

04:35.090 --> 04:36.756
That means no blasting
Blues Traveler

04:36.792 --> 04:38.458
"'cause it's 'Run-Around'
time somewhere."

04:38.493 --> 04:41.561
Geez, relax, man. You're
the most badass boss I know.

04:41.597 --> 04:43.096
Why are you so worried
about this guy?

04:43.131 --> 04:46.299
'Cause I think Erickson hates me.
Last time he was here,

04:46.335 --> 04:49.086
I said I'd rather be
dead in a ditch than alive

04:49.087 --> 04:51.838
watching a tennis match. Turns
out he's a huge tennis fan

04:51.874 --> 04:53.907
and his wife was found
dead in a ditch.

04:53.942 --> 04:56.877
Personally, I'd rather be dead
in a ditch than at a tennis match.

04:56.912 --> 04:59.346
I agree, but please
don't say that

04:59.381 --> 05:01.314
in front of our CEO when he
gets here.

05:01.350 --> 05:03.416
Okay, well, shut up a second.
Zorn on the horn.

05:03.452 --> 05:06.553
Well, well, well.
No, I'd-I'd love to help you out,

05:06.588 --> 05:08.955
but I'm super busy
here at work, okay? Whoops.

05:08.991 --> 05:13.193
No, he's not!
Whoever this is, he'll be right there!

05:13.228 --> 05:15.662
Hey, sorry it took me so long.
Traffic on the freeway

05:15.697 --> 05:18.632
was terribly hard to walk
through on foot.

05:18.667 --> 05:22.569
Zorn, I want you to train me
to be more like you.

05:22.604 --> 05:25.698
Really? You need me
to train you to hate... you?

05:25.733 --> 05:28.842
No, I want you to train me
to be a warrior.

05:28.877 --> 05:31.745
If I'm gonna marry Edie,
I need to be able to protect her.

05:31.780 --> 05:33.914
Being sweet, lovable Craig
isn't enough.

05:33.949 --> 05:35.882
I need to be tough,
lovable Craig.

05:35.918 --> 05:39.286
She already has that man: Alangulon.
The fruit of my loins!

05:39.321 --> 05:41.688
Zorn, I want you to picture Alan

05:41.723 --> 05:44.324
trying to stand up
to a meth-crazed mugger.

05:44.359 --> 05:46.960
All right, cool. I'll dust
off the old imagination here,

05:46.995 --> 05:48.128
let me see what I got.

05:48.163 --> 05:51.564
Oh, my God! That junkie
tore him to bits in seconds.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.434
I mean, that was like running
a tomato through a band saw.

05:54.469 --> 05:57.103
Why-Why did you make
me picture that?

05:57.139 --> 05:59.539
- So you see my point, Zorn.
- Fine.

05:59.574 --> 06:04.010
I, Zorn, will make it
my mission to train thee,

06:04.046 --> 06:07.647
Craig,
in the ways of the warrior!

06:07.683 --> 06:09.416
Here you go, kale salad,

06:09.451 --> 06:11.518
- no Parmesan, extra lemon juice.
- Ooh.

06:11.553 --> 06:13.320
B.S.! He'll have a live pig,

06:13.355 --> 06:16.489
and don't you dare help him
kill it when it arrives.

06:39.247 --> 06:41.147
Wow.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.654
Wait a second.

06:49.891 --> 06:52.451
Only one...

06:54.717 --> 06:55.716
- So, this is the place.
- Whoa.

06:55.751 --> 06:58.469
Uh, my aunt can't get
pregnant and, uh, she doesn't

06:58.470 --> 07:01.188
trust animals, so she says
her plants are her children.

07:01.224 --> 07:02.656
Wow.

07:02.692 --> 07:05.059
- Oh, you got aloe!
- Yeah, we got aloe,

07:05.094 --> 07:06.961
we got drinks,
we got everything.

07:06.996 --> 07:08.662
Aloe is the best.
Aloe vera.

07:08.698 --> 07:10.297
You know, a lot of people
say that aloe should not

07:10.333 --> 07:12.366
be applied to exquisite and
elegant legs such as these.

07:12.401 --> 07:13.434
Really?

07:13.469 --> 07:14.735
You mind if I, uh,
crack one of these off?

07:14.770 --> 07:16.070
Hop to it.

07:16.105 --> 07:17.538
Only the best
for the best legs.

07:17.573 --> 07:19.874
How often do you apply?

07:19.909 --> 07:23.043
Every day at breakfast I apply
aloe to my real, human legs.

07:23.079 --> 07:25.146
You really do have amazing,
amazing legs.

07:25.181 --> 07:27.615
Oh, you know what?
Speaking of...

07:27.650 --> 07:29.183
these legs aren't
gonna tone themselves.

07:29.218 --> 07:30.651
Mind if I hop on this?

07:30.686 --> 07:31.685
Not at all.

07:31.721 --> 07:35.289
Wow, you know your plants
and you can climb stairs.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.591
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, yup, I'm good.

07:37.627 --> 07:39.293
Just a little
too much aloe on there.

07:40.396 --> 07:42.263
Zorn, is this
really necessary?

07:42.298 --> 07:43.864
All right, the first step
in being a warrior

07:43.900 --> 07:45.099
is looking like a warrior.

07:45.134 --> 07:48.602
Hey, you look, like,
so fierce, man.

07:48.638 --> 07:51.138
Look at that.
I mean, you are no longer

07:51.174 --> 07:52.540
Craig the Therapist.
You're more like

07:52.575 --> 07:54.842
Craig the Psycho-Therapist.

07:54.877 --> 07:56.277
But did you have
to rip the sleeves off?

07:56.312 --> 07:58.112
I just bought this shirt
last week.

07:58.147 --> 08:01.282
Warriors don't have sleeves.
We need our arms free,

08:01.317 --> 08:02.816
you know, for
windmill punches

08:02.852 --> 08:04.885
and raising our fists
victoriously, like this.

08:04.921 --> 08:07.821
Yeah!
Ha-ha.

08:28.010 --> 08:30.711
Zorn.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.201
Yes.

08:55.371 --> 08:57.789
You know, I
totally thought you didn't

08:57.790 --> 09:00.207
know how to swim, but
you're actually pretty good.

09:00.243 --> 09:02.376
Well, I take a bath
every Sunday,

09:02.411 --> 09:06.113
so what is that but a tiny ocean?

09:08.851 --> 09:10.317
Yeah, you should
come back Saturday.

09:10.353 --> 09:12.086
I'm gonna be here
all day, so...

09:12.121 --> 09:17.858
- Oh, uh, that sounds good.
- It's cold.

09:17.893 --> 09:19.893
Oh, you want to, uh,
wear this towel?

09:19.929 --> 09:22.062
Thank you.

09:22.098 --> 09:25.065
Uh... hold on a second.
Let me take that.

09:25.101 --> 09:26.767
- Uh...
- What?

09:26.802 --> 09:29.069
I just, uh, I just caught a...
caught a spider, yeah,

09:29.105 --> 09:32.706
between my leg and the towel.
I got to go take care of that.

09:42.171 --> 09:44.271
Oh, Alan,
how was the beach house?

09:44.306 --> 09:45.739
A super magical day.

09:45.775 --> 09:47.775
I don't want to talk about it,
though. Thanks.

09:47.810 --> 09:52.246
Well, if you decide you do want to
talk about it, I'm here.

09:52.281 --> 09:53.881
Come on, honey.
Let's rap.

09:53.916 --> 09:56.917
- Kid's still say that, right?
- No, we don't, no.

09:56.952 --> 09:58.919
Well, do you want half
of my sandwich?

09:58.954 --> 10:00.621
<i>No, ok... fine,
sure, don't come in.</i>

10:00.656 --> 10:03.112
<i>Just shove it
under the door, okay? Bye.</i>

10:04.326 --> 10:05.959
<i>These numbers are terrible, Linda.</i>

10:05.995 --> 10:08.128
I know. We've been
having some...

10:08.164 --> 10:10.197
employee productivity issues.

10:10.232 --> 10:12.699
Todd!
Where have you been?

10:12.735 --> 10:14.568
I need that report on my
desk by the end of the day.

10:14.603 --> 10:17.037
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just playing some tennis.

10:17.072 --> 10:18.338
It helps me concentrate.

10:18.374 --> 10:21.208
- I'm gonna tackle the report right now.
- Tennis, you say?

10:21.243 --> 10:24.778
Oh.
Important client.

10:24.814 --> 10:29.183
I'll be right back.
Hey, Edie, What's up?

10:29.218 --> 10:31.118
- Hey, have you seen Zorn?
- No.

10:31.153 --> 10:32.152
Why? Everything okay?

10:32.188 --> 10:33.654
Well, I'm worried about Alan.

10:33.689 --> 10:35.422
He had a 40-minute shower cry.

10:35.458 --> 10:36.757
I don't know much
about parenting.

10:36.792 --> 10:39.626
I'm gonna guess gay.
Okay, got to go.

10:39.662 --> 10:42.563
What do you think we can do
about our productivity problem?

10:42.598 --> 10:44.698
Well, I do have some
ideas, actually...

10:44.733 --> 10:47.400
Todd calls his mom
on company time.

10:48.417 --> 10:51.018
<i>Okay, warrior,
let's build up that confidence.</i>

10:51.053 --> 10:53.187
I'm gonna do a power poem.

10:53.222 --> 10:55.723
Capable.

10:55.758 --> 10:58.325
Resourceful.
Acrobatic.

10:58.361 --> 11:00.260
Incorrigible.

11:00.296 --> 11:02.629
Giggly?
Sometimes, yeah.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.366
Craig!

11:05.401 --> 11:08.569
Oh. Zorn.
Do not barge into my bathroom.

11:08.604 --> 11:11.338
Or my bedroom.
Or my dreams.

11:11.374 --> 11:13.240
All right, Craig, you
can become a warrior,

11:13.275 --> 11:15.476
or you can become someone
whose privacy I respect,

11:15.511 --> 11:16.977
but you can't become both.

11:17.012 --> 11:19.880
Zorn, do not slap me again.
Enough is enough.

11:21.504 --> 11:24.605
You stood up to me.
You are now a warrior.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.006
What about learning how
to fight?

11:26.041 --> 11:28.041
Nah, you're never gonna
be good at that, no.

11:28.077 --> 11:29.877
Here's a little tip, though,
just sucker punch people.

11:29.912 --> 11:31.311
Now get dressed
and drive me to work.

11:31.347 --> 11:33.480
- Hell no, Zorn.
- That's the spirit.

11:33.516 --> 11:36.049
But there is a time and a place,
and I really need a ride.

11:36.085 --> 11:39.653
<i>Has Alan seemed weird to you?
I feel like the clueless mom</i>

11:39.688 --> 11:42.523
- in an afterschool special.
- What, like he's on drugs?

11:42.558 --> 11:44.825
Edie, come on.
Let's be honest with ourselves.

11:44.860 --> 11:47.794
Alangulon's not cool enough
for anyone to offer him drugs.

11:47.830 --> 11:50.063
<i>No, I saw a thing on 60 Minutes</i>

11:50.099 --> 11:52.132
that said even lame kids
can get drugs now.

11:52.167 --> 11:55.802
<i>- Edie, I got to go.
- Linda.</i>

11:55.838 --> 11:58.405
Have you moved your desk
to work among your lessers?

11:58.440 --> 12:00.707
You truly you are
a man of the people!

12:00.743 --> 12:02.376
Zorn, I got demoted.

12:02.411 --> 12:05.156
Save your sucking up
for your new boss, Todd.

12:05.161 --> 12:07.214
What?
But you're the best boss ever.

12:07.249 --> 12:09.016
How could this happen?

12:09.051 --> 12:11.452
Seriously, I don't understand
corporate employment

12:11.453 --> 12:13.854
structure, so I'm
genuinely confused here.

12:13.889 --> 12:15.522
I was already on thin ice
with Erickson,

12:15.558 --> 12:17.157
and then Todd swooped in
and said all the right things

12:17.192 --> 12:19.793
and used all the right...
tennis metaphors.

12:19.828 --> 12:21.595
Well, I mean, you know,
look at the bright side.

12:21.630 --> 12:23.564
Now you can sit out here
in cubicles with all of us

12:23.599 --> 12:26.900
and make Linda jokes.
Screw Linda, right, sir?

12:26.936 --> 12:28.702
You don't need
to call me "sir."

12:28.737 --> 12:30.604
I'm not your superior anymore.

12:30.639 --> 12:32.606
Not my superior?
Huh.

12:32.641 --> 12:34.408
Yeah. W-Wait a second...

12:34.443 --> 12:35.842
not my superior...

12:35.878 --> 12:37.477
dresses...

12:37.513 --> 12:39.646
earrings...

12:39.682 --> 12:43.083
seeing a gynecologist
for your penis... I...

12:43.118 --> 12:46.119
Oh, my God.

12:46.155 --> 12:49.998
You're a woman!

12:50.225 --> 12:51.525
Please, okay? I just...

12:51.560 --> 12:53.527
I need more Zephyritol.
I'm desperate.

12:53.562 --> 12:56.463
Well... there is an old saying
in the medical community:

12:56.498 --> 12:58.231
the first taste is free.

12:58.267 --> 13:00.500
After that, bitch better
have my money.

13:00.536 --> 13:02.903
- $500 to be exact.
- What?

13:02.938 --> 13:05.339
No. Come on.
I need those pills.

13:05.374 --> 13:08.408
I didn't just change my legs,
it changed my entire life.

13:08.444 --> 13:10.577
I finally felt like the Alan
that I've always wanted to be.

13:10.613 --> 13:13.046
You know? Okay, the Alan that
can just walk up to anybody

13:13.082 --> 13:16.316
and say, "Inspect me.
You'll find nothing weird."

13:16.352 --> 13:18.986
- Just have a heart.
- I'm West Zephyrian.

13:19.021 --> 13:21.788
I actually don't have a heart.
There is a ghost in my chest

13:21.824 --> 13:23.924
that scares the blood
around my body.

13:23.959 --> 13:26.259
So give me the money,
or get ready

13:26.295 --> 13:28.662
for some serious
withdrawal symptoms.

13:28.697 --> 13:29.896
Withdrawal?

13:41.494 --> 13:42.726
This site says
I should confront Alan

13:42.762 --> 13:44.461
and demand he tell me
what's going on.

13:44.497 --> 13:47.565
And if he refuses...
I should...

13:47.600 --> 13:50.701
send him to Bible
reeducation camp.

13:50.736 --> 13:52.102
What do you think, Craig?

13:52.138 --> 13:55.039
- Craig!
- I'm sorry. It's just the sandman

13:55.074 --> 13:56.907
has just been on my case today.

13:56.943 --> 13:58.208
Well, maybe you shouldn't have
gotten up to investigate

13:58.244 --> 13:59.777
every little sound last night.

13:59.812 --> 14:01.312
Well, maybe we shouldn't
have an air conditioner

14:01.347 --> 14:04.348
- that sounds like a man strangling Alan.
- Alan.

14:04.383 --> 14:06.083
What are you doing?

14:06.118 --> 14:08.252
Oh, uh, me? I'm just
looking for a mint.

14:08.287 --> 14:10.187
Why are you wearing
a pig nose?

14:10.222 --> 14:11.922
I'm doing the pigs...
uh, factories.

14:11.958 --> 14:14.625
Protesting the pig factories.
They are very bad, you know.

14:14.660 --> 14:17.127
Pigs are actually smarter
than dogs, so... poof.

14:17.163 --> 14:20.798
Yeah, I think I saw that on
someone's Facebook wall.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.534
Can I have $500 in cash
to do an art project?

14:23.569 --> 14:25.035
It's a really special thing
I'm working on

14:25.071 --> 14:26.971
where I take five $100 bills

14:27.006 --> 14:29.139
and I arrange them on a piece
of construction paper.

14:29.175 --> 14:31.275
It's a comment on
commercialism and stuff.

14:31.310 --> 14:35.012
- Sounds like it's a good idea.
- $500 on art?

14:35.047 --> 14:36.580
Fine.
I guess I'll just go get it

14:36.616 --> 14:39.116
from that guy down
at the ravine.

14:39.151 --> 14:43.554
A couple weeks learning
about Jesus can't be that bad.

14:44.690 --> 14:46.457
Milady.

14:52.999 --> 14:56.066
- Milady.
- Zorn, just because I'm a woman

14:56.102 --> 14:57.801
doesn't mean you have to stand
up every time I stand up.

14:57.837 --> 15:00.237
- Of course, milady.
- And please stop talking to me

15:00.272 --> 15:03.273
like some sad-ass
lute player at Ren Fair.

15:03.309 --> 15:04.975
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.
It's just, you know,

15:05.011 --> 15:06.410
a lot to wrap my head around.

15:06.445 --> 15:08.412
I mean, you were a
woman this whole time?

15:08.447 --> 15:10.114
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So that time

15:10.149 --> 15:12.349
we came to work dressed
as Lady Zorn and She-Linda...

15:12.385 --> 15:15.719
You just showed up in a dress.
We never discussed that beforehand.

15:15.755 --> 15:19.691
It's just, I... I feel like I lost
my best friend at work,

15:19.692 --> 15:22.543
I mean, you were my bro.
You know? And now?

15:22.544 --> 15:25.511
No mo' bro... you know?
I'm still the same person

15:25.546 --> 15:28.098
- I always was, only now...
- You can't vote.

15:28.134 --> 15:32.503
Nothing's changed.
We're still friends, or at least

15:32.538 --> 15:34.071
I hope we can still be friends.

15:34.106 --> 15:36.540
Who else is gonna
help me overthrow Todd?

15:36.575 --> 15:38.842
Yeah, but I bet you
overthrow like a girl.

15:43.315 --> 15:46.466
<i>500 bucks.
Come on, </i>

15:46.501 --> 15:47.818
<i>something around here's
got to be worth 500 bucks.</i>

15:47.853 --> 15:49.687
<i>Oh. Laptop.</i>

15:57.363 --> 16:00.464
Fullerton Online University!

16:00.499 --> 16:04.068
So you think you can break
into Craig's fiancé's house

16:04.103 --> 16:05.936
where Craig lives rent-free...

16:05.971 --> 16:08.906
and take from Craig's fiancé?

16:08.941 --> 16:11.842
- Well, you got another thing coming.
- Stop!

16:11.877 --> 16:14.511
- It's me.
- Craig, what are you doing?!

16:14.547 --> 16:17.081
I'm being the guy that you can
count on for everything, Edie.

16:17.116 --> 16:20.184
- Oh, my spleen.
- Alan.

16:20.219 --> 16:21.585
Whoa!

16:21.620 --> 16:23.220
Oh, my God.

16:23.255 --> 16:25.789
I literally kicked
your ass back to Zephyria.

16:27.226 --> 16:29.727
<i>Well, it looks like the
Zephyritol is starting to wear off.</i>

16:29.762 --> 16:31.629
I mean, who would have
thought that taking strange

16:31.630 --> 16:33.497
drugs from a cave doctor
would have consequences?

16:33.532 --> 16:36.133
Well, we're gonna talk about all
this when your father gets here.

16:36.168 --> 16:37.735
I called him.
He's very worried.

16:37.770 --> 16:40.137
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

16:40.172 --> 16:42.306
You kicked my
son's ass, Craig.

16:42.341 --> 16:43.640
Edie, I thought
he was a burglar.

16:43.676 --> 16:46.227
Look, I was just trying
to protect us, so you don't

16:46.228 --> 16:48.779
always have to call Zorn at
the first sign of trouble.

16:48.814 --> 16:51.448
I call Zorn because he's
a big dumb barbarian

16:51.484 --> 16:53.450
and he's good
at dumb barbarian stuff,

16:53.486 --> 16:56.420
like murder, maiden rescue,
car repair.

16:56.455 --> 16:59.490
I fell in love with you because you
are all the things that Zorn isn't.

16:59.525 --> 17:03.460
But if I can't do the things that
I do and the things that Zorn does,

17:03.496 --> 17:06.363
then I'll never be everything
that you need.

17:06.397 --> 17:08.232
You don't need to be everything.

17:08.267 --> 17:09.900
You're sweet and sensitive.

17:09.935 --> 17:13.704
- Zorn's just...
- Zorn!

17:17.710 --> 17:19.542
Alangulon.
I have come to vanquish

17:19.578 --> 17:23.178
your drug-related issues!

17:24.006 --> 17:27.255
Come on, junkie. Spill it.
Tell me what you're hiding.

17:27.290 --> 17:28.623
<i>Dad, I'm not a junkie.</i>

17:28.658 --> 17:30.291
Ah. That is exactly what
a junkie would say.

17:30.326 --> 17:33.227
I was only taking Zephyritol
to make my legs look normal.

17:33.263 --> 17:35.096
I was just worried that
Layla wouldn't like me

17:35.131 --> 17:37.865
because I'm, like,
well, I'm different.

17:37.901 --> 17:39.934
Well, why do you
care if Layla loves you?

17:39.969 --> 17:41.669
She's not the woman
who birthed you.

17:41.704 --> 17:43.771
Edie, please.
Alangulon.

17:43.807 --> 17:45.840
I know exactly what you're
going through.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.508
Take a seat, son.

17:47.544 --> 17:51.512
I recently found out something
insane about someone in my life.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.815
Turns out this guy I was hanging
with was a woman.

17:53.850 --> 17:57.185
A woman, Alangulon.
Just imagine my surprise.

17:57.220 --> 18:00.721
And sure,
at first it was an adjustment,

18:00.757 --> 18:02.223
but then I realized something.

18:02.258 --> 18:05.893
Once you really care
about someone, that's it.

18:05.929 --> 18:08.062
That feeling on the inside
doesn't change

18:08.098 --> 18:11.769
just because things might
look different on the outside.

18:11.804 --> 18:14.202
Wow, Dad. That was
actually really helpful.

18:14.237 --> 18:16.637
Yeah, I've never heard you
say anything that deep.

18:16.673 --> 18:18.506
I didn't know you had it in you.

18:18.541 --> 18:20.608
No, no. I know.
Yeah, it blew my mind, too.

18:20.643 --> 18:23.444
But it turns out that I'm
kick-ass at being sensitive.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.400
- Especially when it comes to my family.
- Oh.

18:28.818 --> 18:33.121
Ah, look at us. Sitting
here just like a real family.

18:33.156 --> 18:37.158
Holding hands
and silently farting.

18:39.129 --> 18:40.928
- Hi, Alan.
- Hey.

18:40.964 --> 18:44.098
Or did a spider kill you?
Are you Alan's ghost?

18:44.134 --> 18:45.533
I actually came
here to apologize

18:45.568 --> 18:47.902
for how I've been acting
kind of crazy lately.

18:47.937 --> 18:49.537
Did you go on Adderall
or something?

18:49.572 --> 18:51.639
That's what made Shannon
so angry and impulsive

18:51.674 --> 18:53.341
and good at AP Spanish.

18:53.376 --> 18:54.609
I need to show you
something, okay?

18:54.644 --> 18:57.745
Alan. What-what
are you doing?!

18:57.780 --> 18:59.647
These are my legs.

19:00.456 --> 19:04.118
- Whoa.
- I knew you'd be freaked out.

19:04.154 --> 19:06.187
Well, kind of, only because...

19:06.222 --> 19:08.089
you had different legs,
like, three days ago.

19:08.124 --> 19:10.124
Well, those weren't my real legs.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.026
I was taking these weird
Zephyrian drugs

19:12.061 --> 19:14.595
to change them and... okay,
look, if you never want

19:14.631 --> 19:16.597
to see me or my freakish legs
ever again, I understand.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.065
- That's fine.
- Alan, the only thing that's

19:18.101 --> 19:19.384
weirding me out is that
you're standing here

19:19.385 --> 19:20.668
with your pants around your ankles.

19:20.703 --> 19:25.370
I just feel like I need
to say sorry for not being

19:25.429 --> 19:28.910
- honest with you.
- I like it when you're yourself.

19:28.945 --> 19:30.878
- It's funny.
- Oh.

19:30.914 --> 19:32.346
You know I have a-a Twitter

19:32.382 --> 19:35.116
where I post funny things
you say and do.

19:35.151 --> 19:37.385
It has like 450 followers.

19:37.420 --> 19:40.054
Wow. Um, is that like a...
is that a lot?

19:40.089 --> 19:42.023
Is that a little?
I don't really know.

19:42.058 --> 19:43.891
- It's respectable.
- Oh.

19:43.927 --> 19:47.828
<i>♪ All I needed was
the love you gave... ♪</i>

19:47.864 --> 19:50.298
Hey, Craig,

19:50.333 --> 19:52.366
I found those special
baby wipes you like to use

19:52.402 --> 19:54.835
instead of toilet paper.

19:54.871 --> 19:59.440
Ooh, you made muffins.
It smells incredible.

<i>he's now changed into
the husband you deserve</i>

20:20.730 --> 20:22.964
<i>and the protector this family needs.</i>

20:22.999 --> 20:26.467
<i>It breaks my heart to leave,
but please don't look for me.</i>

20:26.502 --> 20:28.636
<i>I know how to disappear.</i>

20:28.671 --> 20:32.540
<i>P.S. Make sure to individually
wrap these muffins</i>

20:32.575 --> 20:34.108
<i>in paper towels
before freezing them.</i>

20:34.143 --> 20:36.143
<i>It preserves the moistness.</i>

20:40.683 --> 20:43.384
Hey-o. Well, I mean,
technically, one and a half times.

20:43.419 --> 20:45.761
You just bursting
into my apartment like that

20:45.796 --> 20:47.521
kind of ruined the sexy vibe.
