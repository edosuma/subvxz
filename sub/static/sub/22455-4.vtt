MUSIC: Flagpole Sitta by Harvey Danger

00:03.052 --> 00:06.089
<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:06.132 --> 00:09.125
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.173 --> 00:13.771
<i>Cos I'm in hell</i>

00:19.096 --> 00:23.887
'Shoes. The boringest purchase.
If only Sophie was here.

00:23.937 --> 00:27.977
'We could horse around
and spray suede protector about.

00:28.018 --> 00:33.936
'Come on, Mark, it's Sophie and Jeff now.
That's fine, it's not Armageddon.

00:33.980 --> 00:38.452
'Relax. Live a little.
Could get brown brogues.

00:38.661 --> 00:43.293
'Best stick to black.
Don't want to go completely mental.'

00:43.343 --> 00:44.742
Can I help you?

00:44.783 --> 00:48.060
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
I'm after some shoes.

00:48.104 --> 00:52.701
I did think brown brogues,
but I'd look like a spiv.

00:52.745 --> 00:58.697
'Spiv? Of course, because this is 1942
Come on, she's only a nice girl.'

00:58.747 --> 01:04.381
Say which ones, cos one time
I recommended shoes, the person tried them on

01:04.429 --> 01:06.784
and they didn't look good,

01:06.829 --> 01:11.381
but then they bought them and I felt bad.

01:11.431 --> 01:13.023
Sorry, you didn't need to know that.

01:13.071 --> 01:15.506
No, it's fine.

01:15.712 --> 01:21.504
I was thinking black, size eight.
But broad. I have a broad foot.

01:21.713 --> 01:24.672
Yeah? Doesn't feel so broad.

01:24.714 --> 01:27.024
But you know how broad they are!

01:27.075 --> 01:29.544
No, I just thought they were broad.

01:29.596 --> 01:31.905
'Keep feeling my foot. Please.'

01:31.956 --> 01:36.269
If we were using
Ancient Egyptian measurements,

01:36.317 --> 01:41.757
I'd say it was about a fifth of a cubit,
or one hand. Your foot's a hand.

01:43.159 --> 01:45.390
Sorry, that's the geekiest joke.

01:45.440 --> 01:49.036
No, I thought it was funny.
I like Ancient Egypt, too.

01:49.081 --> 01:51.960
OK, I'll get you a couple of pairs.

01:52.002 --> 01:57.794
'Knows about cubits, not comfortable
in her own skin. She's one of me! '

01:57.843 --> 02:02.965
So, Hans - old issue, I know,
but the band name.

02:03.005 --> 02:07.124
It's a statement,
but what does the statement... mean?

02:07.166 --> 02:08.679
There you go. Free munchies.

02:08.726 --> 02:12.926
- Did you just nick this?
- Course. They should pay me to eat this shit.

02:12.968 --> 02:15.528
Free chocco. Mm, tasty.

02:15.568 --> 02:18.129
The secret ingredient is crime.

02:18.169 --> 02:22.846
So, Jez, you know Pete Preston's outfit,
the Executioner's Bong?

02:22.890 --> 02:24.847
- Yeah, bunch of wankers.
- Exactly.

02:24.891 --> 02:28.567
They want me
to front them for a couple of gigs.

02:28.612 --> 02:30.250
What?

02:30.292 --> 02:32.887
I'm gonna have to quit Coming Up For Blair.

02:32.933 --> 02:38.805
You can't be in two bands -
Tom Petty tried that. Nearly killed him.

02:38.855 --> 02:44.726
What about me? And you owe me for the
computery thing we don't know how to work.

02:44.776 --> 02:48.326
Maybe I can get you in on... maracas.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.892
I won't be Bez. I wanna be in there on merit.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.089
You won't make it on merit.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.892
Just get me in. Then we'll see about merit.

02:57.580 --> 03:02.860
'It's cool. I'm not a stalker.
I thank shop girls with chocolates.

03:02.901 --> 03:09.854
'I just happened to pop by a few days later to
let her know I've broken them in. That's my line.'

03:09.903 --> 03:11.383
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

03:11.424 --> 03:15.623
I'm looking for April. I'm a friend and...

03:15.665 --> 03:16.814
You're a friend of April's?

03:19.146 --> 03:23.220
No, but obviously April's at university now.

03:23.267 --> 03:28.741
Of course. Of course she is.
We were talking about that. OK, thanks.

03:28.789 --> 03:30.507
'Do a Columbo. Do a Columbo.'

03:30.549 --> 03:35.499
Just... remind me,
which university has April gone to?

03:35.550 --> 03:36.461
Dartmouth.

03:36.511 --> 03:40.107
Dartmouth. Of course. Dartmouth. Thanks.

03:40.152 --> 03:46.023
'Good old Columbo. Just the one
technique, but shits on Quincy.'

03:47.394 --> 03:51.547
Yup, going on tour, baby.
The important thing is... I'm not Bez.

03:51.595 --> 03:54.474
Excellent, baby! What's a bez?

03:54.516 --> 03:57.189
Oh, er, Bez in American...

03:57.236 --> 04:00.195
He's like... You know
Flavor Flav from Public Enemy?

04:00.237 --> 04:00.987
No.

04:01.038 --> 04:05.794
Well, he's like him. But with maracas.

04:05.839 --> 04:10.391
Right. Hey, Jez is going
on a nationwide music tour!

04:10.440 --> 04:14.275
Three dates across the south coast,
100 quid a gig. You do the math.

04:14.321 --> 04:18.361
So you're all piling round in a van?

04:18.402 --> 04:24.195
Well, I'll be going by National Express.
You can't make a van bigger than it is.

04:24.244 --> 04:28.716
No matter how much I or anyone else
may wish it were a bit... bigger.

04:28.765 --> 04:29.880
You do the math.

04:29.926 --> 04:32.804
- S. Math-s. Where are you going?

04:32.846 --> 04:36.157
All the biggies.
Southampton, Dartmouth, Plymouth.

04:36.207 --> 04:40.247
I wish I wasn't working.
I'd love to see the English Riviera.

04:40.288 --> 04:44.043
- Dartmouth?
- The very student union where we met.

04:44.089 --> 04:44.806
Cool.

04:44.850 --> 04:49.003
'This isn't stalking. I want to support Jez.'

04:49.051 --> 04:51.850
- So, they good, this band?
- Bunch of wankers.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.008
I'd love to come, then.

04:56.613 --> 05:01.404
I bet you don't get these in the van.
Air on or off.

05:01.454 --> 05:02.604
How long does it take again?

05:02.655 --> 05:05.328
Just eight and three-quarter hours.

05:05.375 --> 05:07.936
Wicked. Thank God we're not in the van.

05:07.976 --> 05:10.207
I can't believe we're going back to Dartie.

05:10.257 --> 05:15.207
<i>- There's no quim likes to party
- Like the quim down in Dartie</i>

05:15.258 --> 05:20.049
Those were the days.
Did you ever appeal about your degree mark?

05:20.099 --> 05:23.331
Who cares about that shit?
I didn't go to university to get a degree.

05:23.380 --> 05:24.734
No. Of course.

05:24.781 --> 05:28.741
No use regretting the past.
I wish I'd done Ancient History...

05:28.782 --> 05:29.897
I thought you did.

05:29.942 --> 05:33.299
I did Business Studies, Jeremy, for three years.

05:33.343 --> 05:36.142
- And I talked to you about it daily.
- Right.

05:36.184 --> 05:40.497
'I could say it's all ancient
history now. He wouldn't like it.'

05:40.545 --> 05:42.980
Well, it's all ancient history now.

05:48.027 --> 05:50.940
'Ha! I'm gonna razz those fuckers.'

05:50.988 --> 05:53.787
Mark, look, it's Super Hans and the band.

- 'You've reached the voicemail of...
- Super Hans.

06:04.912 --> 06:06.982
'Please leave a message.'

06:07.032 --> 06:10.912
That guy. I love that guy. That is so funny.

06:17.355 --> 06:22.067
'You won't be laughing so hard
when the loan repayments kick in, buddy.

06:22.117 --> 06:24.711
'I suppose you can always defer.

06:24.757 --> 06:31.392
'Showtime. "Just swinging through town,
thought I'd check what's hot at the Arts Fac."

06:31.439 --> 06:36.674
'After she's thrown up,
we can go for a pizza. I think that's her! '

06:36.721 --> 06:40.954
H... Hello? Hi. Sorry. Hello?

06:41.002 --> 06:43.118
'Shit! Where's she going?

06:43.162 --> 06:47.874
'I'm not licensed to be in this far.
I'm following her! Shit!

06:47.924 --> 06:52.919
'What am I gonna do next, take secret photos
and lie masturbating in my own filth? '

06:52.965 --> 06:55.605
Sorry, do I recognise you?

06:55.646 --> 06:58.559
Er, the... shoe shop?

06:58.767 --> 07:02.681
Black brogues. I thought I was
broad-footed, you felt otherwise.

07:02.728 --> 07:05.607
Wow! What are you doing here?

07:05.649 --> 07:09.484
Sorry, you're obviously a student.
Are you doing history too?

07:09.530 --> 07:11.680
Er... yeah.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.723
- Wow. Who's your tutor?
- Professor...

07:18.412 --> 07:20.085
MacLeish.

07:20.133 --> 07:23.729
You're here for the tutorial. Sorry. I'm a bit slow.

07:23.774 --> 07:25.207
They'll soon knock that out of me.

07:25.254 --> 07:28.930
Along with any individuality. Not that I've got any.

07:29.815 --> 07:32.011
OK. Come on.

07:34.017 --> 07:36.451
After you.

07:36.497 --> 07:39.808
'Why am I walking into the jaws of death?

07:39.858 --> 07:42.168
'They're best avoided, that's common knowledge.'

07:42.219 --> 07:45.053
Yes. So. Here we are.

07:45.100 --> 07:48.650
Another exciting trawl down the vista of history.

07:48.701 --> 07:54.572
There is no new history,
only new historians. Ha, ha.

07:54.622 --> 07:56.215
Were you here last week?

07:56.263 --> 07:58.094
Me?

07:58.143 --> 08:01.102
'This is my moment of madness,
my Clapham Common.'

08:01.144 --> 08:05.263
Er, no. I'm... I'm new. I'm mature.

08:05.305 --> 08:11.177
I went to Coventry for a week in error.
Lovely. Destroyed in the war. Obviously.

08:11.227 --> 08:15.619
There was a mix-up.
I'm not on the forms but I'm... here now.

08:15.668 --> 08:19.264
Well, obviously. Fine. What did you make of it?

08:19.309 --> 08:23.940
'Is that how easy it is
to steal some education?

08:23.990 --> 08:26.585
'Bloody hell! Who's in charge?

08:26.631 --> 08:32.981
'The world's just people going into rooms
and saying things? It's all a swizzle? '

08:33.033 --> 08:35.946
I thought there were contradictions.

08:35.994 --> 08:39.590
They suggested Christ's Galilee
was culturally Roman.

08:39.635 --> 08:41.943
Not that old fallacy?

08:41.995 --> 08:45.875
The Romans didn't station a legion
in Galilee till, what, 130 AD?

08:45.916 --> 08:47.953
Yes, indeed.

08:47.997 --> 08:51.149
But I suppose all research funding
leads to Rome.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.870
What was your name again?

08:52.918 --> 08:55.911
Corrigan. Mark Corrigan.

08:55.959 --> 09:02.070
'I'm doing it, Dad. I'm studying Ancient History
and there's not a thing you can do! '

09:03.241 --> 09:09.842
'I'll give them a hand.
Not that I'm a roadie. I'm just helping out.

09:09.883 --> 09:14.002
'I bet Ringo had to carry stuff.
Not that I'm anything like Ringo.'

09:14.044 --> 09:15.160
Are you in Executioner's Bong?

09:15.205 --> 09:16.399
I sure am, little lady.

09:16.445 --> 09:18.242
- Would you sign this?
- Fuck, yeah.

09:20.126 --> 09:24.837
Jez, when you've finished that,
could you get us six lattes?

09:25.567 --> 09:29.004
That is so Pete.
Fuck off, Pete.

09:29.048 --> 09:33.282
It's just a... little thing we have going.

09:33.330 --> 09:35.798
You've seen Spinal Tap, yeah?

09:35.850 --> 09:37.523
Good luck with this week's reading.

09:37.571 --> 09:42.805
If you're plagiarising, don't do it from a book
I've written. It's almost bound to ring a bell.

09:42.852 --> 09:45.447
Mark, April, hold on.

09:45.493 --> 09:51.843
I'm having a gathering tonight for potential
contributors to my folly, Rhombus Magazine.

09:51.895 --> 09:54.170
Could you two make it?

09:54.215 --> 09:55.171
- Yeah.
- Sure.

09:55.216 --> 09:58.653
'I'm being ushered into the inner ring.

09:58.857 --> 10:04.615
'I bet they make jokes about the Atkins diet
and do prank calls to Gore Vidal in Esperanto.'

10:06.859 --> 10:09.215
So, what do you play in the Bong?

10:09.260 --> 10:11.376
Me? Er, everything. I do everything.

10:11.420 --> 10:15.130
I can't do it all at once so I get them to help.

10:15.181 --> 10:19.414
Sometimes at a gig
I'll just cool it with the maracas.

10:19.462 --> 10:20.578
Oh, yeah, like Bez.

10:20.623 --> 10:24.458
No, not like Bez. Nothing like fucking Bez.

10:24.504 --> 10:31.264
Can I ask your advice? I really wanna set up
a label for bands that can't get a deal...

10:31.306 --> 10:36.142
'Maybe she'll suck me off
after the gig. What about Nancy?

10:36.187 --> 10:38.861
'What am I gonna do
when she tries to suck me off? '

10:38.908 --> 10:44.381
capitalist agendas that make
everyone sound basically the same.

10:44.429 --> 10:47.024
Sorry, I'd better just say now...

10:47.070 --> 10:49.539
I've got a girlfriend.

10:52.432 --> 10:55.902
Wow! This is great. But aren't
you gonna max out on your loan?

10:55.952 --> 11:00.072
Fuck it. Get another one. You can always defer.

11:00.114 --> 11:02.753
- To university.
- To university.

11:02.794 --> 11:06.948
'She is so lovely and doesn't even realise.

11:06.996 --> 11:10.546
'No-one's ever told her. I'll tell her. No.

11:10.597 --> 11:12.189
'If she realises, I'm finished.'

11:12.237 --> 11:17.187
Mark. You're here. You didn't say. You're here.

11:17.238 --> 11:19.275
So, how do you two know each other?

11:19.319 --> 11:23.757
Let's not talk that shit.
"This is what I do, I'm from here."

11:23.800 --> 11:27.680
We're all people, after all. With hands and feet.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.997
We met in our tutorial.

11:30.042 --> 11:32.193
You were in a tutorial?

11:32.243 --> 11:36.522
I may party hard,
but I do go to the odd tutorial.

11:36.564 --> 11:41.036
- What?
- You have to, if you do a history degree.

11:41.085 --> 11:42.803
You're doing a history degree?

11:42.845 --> 11:44.199
That's right, Jeremy.

11:44.246 --> 11:48.001
He's in a band.
His hearing's gone, all the gigs.

11:48.047 --> 11:52.519
How long are you gonna be here?
Three years?

11:52.568 --> 11:56.039
That's how long undergraduate degrees are.

11:56.089 --> 11:58.843
- So you're not coming back?
- Nope.

11:58.890 --> 12:02.930
So... what shall I do? Rent out your room?

12:02.971 --> 12:06.169
Of course. We've been over this.

12:06.212 --> 12:08.522
- Have we?
- That's right, Jeremy.

12:08.573 --> 12:13.284
But I... I don't understand.

12:13.334 --> 12:17.965
Let me get you a drink.
I'll explain everything all over again.

12:19.256 --> 12:20.848
You're stalking her?

12:20.896 --> 12:22.967
No! It's a passionate, romantic gesture.

12:23.017 --> 12:25.577
Right. I won't say a word.

12:25.617 --> 12:27.256
Good luck with the stalking.

12:27.298 --> 12:29.493
I'm not stalking her.

12:29.538 --> 12:31.131
Jeremy, can I have a word?

12:31.179 --> 12:34.934
Yeah, sure, Pete.

12:34.980 --> 12:37.734
If it's about the amp,
I'd be happy to pay for any damage.

12:37.781 --> 12:39.851
It's Super Hans.

12:39.901 --> 12:42.177
He's nicked some booze and stolen a maraca.

12:42.222 --> 12:44.418
I can work with just one.

12:44.463 --> 12:47.261
No, we need a kind of front-man.

12:47.303 --> 12:51.662
Someone to hit a few keys on the sequencer,
make a bit of a show.

12:51.705 --> 12:53.696
Would you feel weird about bumping Super Hans?

12:53.745 --> 12:56.306
No. I mean, yeah. But...

12:56.346 --> 13:01.467
No. Yes, initially. But I've thought
about it and... no, I'd feel fine.

13:01.507 --> 13:03.897
All right. Wicked.

13:05.788 --> 13:08.383
'How cheap dare I go?

13:08.429 --> 13:12.628
'Professor MacLeish said "party".
It'll get jumbled in the common lot.

13:12.670 --> 13:16.950
'I could break the £2.99 barrier.
There be monsters.

13:16.992 --> 13:21.942
'I'll dump this and drink the communal lager.
I think I know who's winning.'

13:21.993 --> 13:24.667
Can you ask Mr Rashid
if he's got anything cheaper?

13:26.394 --> 13:28.989
OK. Fair enough.

13:29.035 --> 13:34.064
Mark, they've moved the bus stop.
Our bloody bus stop's been moved.

13:34.116 --> 13:38.828
Everything changes. Five years ago,
I'd have cut off my right leg

13:38.878 --> 13:42.349
just to speak to Professor MacLeish,
now I'm going to his party.

13:42.399 --> 13:44.230
And I'm headlining a band.

13:44.279 --> 13:48.068
'Scuse me, friend, can I see
what you've got in your pocket?

13:48.120 --> 13:51.352
Why? I'm not a student. I am a real person.

13:51.401 --> 13:56.157
Mr Rashid, it's us! Remember?
The El Dude brothers.

13:56.202 --> 13:58.671
You gave us that out-of-date hummus.

13:58.883 --> 14:01.352
Jez was really ill
and we laughed about it.

14:01.404 --> 14:03.839
Who the hell put that there?

14:09.046 --> 14:11.163
'I can't believe he called the police! '

14:11.207 --> 14:15.406
I've gotta get out. I'm meant to be
on stage any fucking minute.

14:15.448 --> 14:18.998
What the hell were you thinking?
Why didn't you just pay for it?

14:19.049 --> 14:20.607
They should pay us to eat that crap.

14:20.649 --> 14:24.245
Stealing things just makes everything very cheap.

14:24.290 --> 14:27.328
Plus, you know how I feel about capitalism.

14:27.371 --> 14:28.520
Yes. Confused.

14:29.772 --> 14:33.686
I'm supposed to be on stage right now.

14:33.893 --> 14:39.332
I was wondering. Maybe you could,
somehow... take the rap for me.

14:39.414 --> 14:43.044
We could say I was in your thrall.
Like Hindley.

14:43.095 --> 14:48.490
No way. Right now, April's probably
getting chatted up by some student

14:48.537 --> 14:51.928
who's realised she's got the magical
combo of beauty and low self-esteem.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.698
OK. Here's the plan.

14:54.899 --> 14:59.690
Good cop, bad cop. I say I'm ill,
Mr Rashid comes in, all sympathetic.

14:59.900 --> 15:05.340
You stand there, hit him - gently
but firmly - until he stops...

15:05.382 --> 15:08.055
not moving, but resisting.

15:08.102 --> 15:10.253
We exit posthaste. Yeah?

15:10.303 --> 15:14.695
We murder Mr Rashid? What is it with
you and stealing and murdering today?

15:14.904 --> 15:16.179
You're mad on it.

15:16.225 --> 15:18.500
Great. Let's just do it.

15:18.545 --> 15:24.861
No! There's procedures. We need to go through
the proper channels. All right!

15:24.907 --> 15:29.902
Since you're so set on a life of crime,
no point in adding criminal damage as well.

15:29.948 --> 15:31.667
Ooh!

15:34.670 --> 15:41.225
Great. Cheer up, mate. We're outlaws.
Like Bonnie and Clyde, Butch and Sundance.

15:41.272 --> 15:43.661
I'll leave a tenner and a note.

15:48.474 --> 15:53.503
I don't need a ticket,
I'm in the band. I got waylaid.

15:53.555 --> 15:56.673
I'm not with the shit-munchers.
Do I look like a civilian?

15:57.956 --> 16:02.712
You are gonna be so embarrassed
in about five minutes.

16:02.758 --> 16:07.275
'Scuse me! Sorry. I'm in the band.
I'm in the band. 'Scuse me.

16:07.319 --> 16:11.791
I need to get to the stage. I'm in the... band.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.277
'Shit! I was only half an hour late
and he's already back in the band.'

16:15.321 --> 16:18.041
Oi! Lads! I'm here!

16:18.082 --> 16:21.393
It's me! I say! Lads! Pete!

16:21.443 --> 16:23.911
This faker said he was in the band.

16:23.963 --> 16:28.117
I'm in the band all right.
I've just crossed the fourth wall.

16:29.805 --> 16:33.276
'Crowd-pleaser! '

16:36.847 --> 16:39.726
<i>Let's do itl Let's have itl
Let's have some more of it.</i>

16:39.808 --> 16:43.085
Look, I'm in the band.
You evict me, that's hilarious.

16:43.129 --> 16:48.124
That's not hilarious. You've got my bollock.
You're pulling on my bollock.

16:49.570 --> 16:56.045
I was, like, "Yeah, the book's based on
good source material - Asterix The Gaul!"

16:56.092 --> 16:58.607
LAUGHTER

16:58.653 --> 17:03.728
So, Mark, do you fancy
doing a little piece for Rhombus?

17:03.774 --> 17:07.450
500 words or so, kicking
the shit out of Simon Schama.

17:07.494 --> 17:08.974
Love to.

17:09.016 --> 17:14.250
I could lay into his... accessible,
interesting take on things.

17:14.297 --> 17:16.971
'To enter the elite,
I must shit on my heroes.'

17:17.018 --> 17:21.694
It could be a regular column.
Slaying the middlebrow sacred cows.

17:21.739 --> 17:27.020
'I can pen insights from the flat.
The Zorro of academia.

17:27.060 --> 17:31.294
"'Who is that masked intellectual who
pricks our pomposity?" Ooh, rough.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.459
<i>'Miscalculated. Dinner party.</i>

17:33.503 --> 17:38.259
'Still, if I drink it all, no-one need know.'

17:40.385 --> 17:42.262
Special bottle?

17:42.305 --> 17:46.094
Just... mine.
I like to know how much I've drunk.

17:46.146 --> 17:50.186
- Are you driving?
- No, it's in case anything happens.

17:50.227 --> 17:52.059
'He thinks I mean date rape.'

17:52.108 --> 17:54.576
Not date rape. Other things.

17:54.629 --> 18:00.102
April, come and join us.
We're talking about my column.

18:00.150 --> 18:02.711
Cheers, but I'm just gonna read Deidre's play.

18:02.751 --> 18:08.031
Emily Dickinson and Virginia Woolf's search
for a lost Sappho manuscript on Lesbos.

18:08.072 --> 18:10.303
Do you think there could there be a subtext

18:10.353 --> 18:11.627
Great!

18:11.673 --> 18:19.104
'Plays, wine, Lesbos... I've arrived!
Just don't mention Bravo Two Zero.'

18:19.155 --> 18:22.034
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:22.076 --> 18:23.510
Do I know you?

18:23.557 --> 18:27.072
No, I'm a friend of Mark's
and I just had my dreams smashed

18:27.118 --> 18:30.315
by the most punctual
electro-dub outfit in Britain.

18:30.358 --> 18:34.592
'Bollocks. He shouldn't be here.
There's limited room in the inner ring.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.596
'That's why it's the inner ring.'

18:36.640 --> 18:39.394
So, you all look pretty happy...

18:39.441 --> 18:42.354
being students.

18:42.402 --> 18:46.601
Well, I've got news for you.
The shit-storm is coming.

18:46.643 --> 18:51.559
That's the real world out there
and let me tell you, baby, it is fucked.

18:51.604 --> 18:56.726
Is that what Dr Chomsky and
Michael Moore told you? In lieu of a degree.

18:56.766 --> 18:58.722
I've got a degree, my friend, oh, yeah.

18:58.766 --> 19:04.604
I was here in the glory years -
mid-'90s. Britpop was kicking off.

19:04.648 --> 19:07.163
Four Weddings had just come out. It was mental.

19:07.209 --> 19:08.642
Four Weddings?

19:08.689 --> 19:12.763
It's a... film, Alasdair.
Very popular at the time. About weddings.

19:12.970 --> 19:14.563
You have seen Four Weddings.

19:14.611 --> 19:18.764
You make out you're this oh-so-clever professor

19:18.972 --> 19:25.846
who hasn't got time to watch Four Weddings or
Ghostbusters like the rest of us? I'm not buying it.

19:25.894 --> 19:28.648
I spend my free time reading,

19:28.695 --> 19:30.686
rather than watching Ghostbusters!

19:30.735 --> 19:37.370
What is the problem with Ghostbusters? "Oh, look
how many books I've got. I must be clever."

19:37.417 --> 19:41.969
Yeah? Well, let's have a look at some of
these books, see how really great they are.

19:42.018 --> 19:44.408
Jeremy, don't manhandle the books!

19:44.459 --> 19:48.339
Sister Carrie by Theodore Dreiser.

19:49.180 --> 19:53.015
"The look on her face was one of disappointment."

19:53.061 --> 19:55.940
That's good, is it? What's good about that?

19:55.982 --> 19:57.655
I don't actually care for Dreiser.

19:57.703 --> 20:02.573
Oh, I see. These are just rows
of books you don't really like.

20:02.624 --> 20:05.298
Do you sit around not reading them?

20:05.345 --> 20:06.494
I think you've said enough.

20:06.545 --> 20:11.176
Jez, why don't you go
and lie in the recovery position?

20:11.226 --> 20:17.747
This is all bollocks. You don't belong here
with the pointy-heads. Tell them.

20:17.788 --> 20:22.260
Tell them that
I'm a hard-working mature student?

20:22.309 --> 20:26.098
He's not a mature student. He's a loan manager.

20:26.150 --> 20:29.382
He lives with me and he eats ready
meals and we play Guess the Revels

20:29.431 --> 20:34.666
and watch Men In Black on our massive
telly and have a fucking good time.

20:35.593 --> 20:40.988
- Loan manager?
- I manage my... student loan. I manage... on it.

20:41.035 --> 20:47.475
April, listen, I was thinking, I should really go.
D'you want to go now? With me?

20:47.516 --> 20:52.308
We're gonna smoke a joint and read
Logue's Homer. You can play Helen.

20:52.358 --> 20:54.588
Or I've got six quid.

20:54.638 --> 20:57.358
Let's get two bottles of Thunderbird
and see who can drink theirs fastest.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.912
So, which one's your dorm?

21:02.961 --> 21:06.432
Kaiser Soze Hall. D'you know it?

21:06.482 --> 21:10.192
Horribly ugly. It's for mature students.

21:10.243 --> 21:15.921
They lock us away in case we infect you
with our diligence and lust for knowledge.

21:15.964 --> 21:22.155
'OK. Dangerously close to getting what I want.
Don't think about Sophie.'

21:22.206 --> 21:23.241
Love your room.

21:23.286 --> 21:28.157
Thanks. The basic undergraduate
lunge for individuality.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.324
I've not even seen Betty Blue. Have you?

21:30.368 --> 21:33.406
Yeah. Great sex-and-suicide flick.

21:33.449 --> 21:35.680
Turned a generation of men
onto girls with mental illness.

21:35.730 --> 21:37.925
OK.

21:37.970 --> 21:42.841
'Perfect. The kind of scenario that used to
terrify me that now I can handle.

21:42.892 --> 21:50.050
'Just... lean in or pull her
towards... me and just... simply...

21:50.094 --> 21:55.533
'This is my chance! And I'm doing... nothing.

21:55.575 --> 21:59.125
'I am now, this instant, missing my chance.'

21:59.176 --> 22:02.567
So... I might... turn in.

22:02.617 --> 22:08.296
Er... yeah. OK. Right. I might... go then.

22:08.339 --> 22:10.614
See you soon.

22:10.659 --> 22:14.130
OK. Cool. See you.

22:17.741 --> 22:20.734
'Oh, well. I kept myself pure for Sophie.

22:20.782 --> 22:23.217
'Like nuns do for Christ. I'm not sleeping with him.

22:23.263 --> 22:28.702
' Come on. She can only hurt me emotionally.'

22:28.744 --> 22:32.705
Look, just now I wanted to... make the move.

22:32.746 --> 22:36.740
I just wanna know, if I make the move now,

22:36.787 --> 22:41.623
even though, admittedly,
the moment has sort of... gone,

22:41.668 --> 22:47.620
you're not gonna back away or
look disgusted or anything, are you?

22:48.230 --> 22:50.699
Great. Thanks.

22:57.352 --> 22:59.628
Just gonna go to the loo.

22:59.673 --> 23:01.710
OK.

23:06.715 --> 23:10.629
Sophie. It's Mark here. Sorry to call so late.

23:10.676 --> 23:15.034
I just wanted to remind you
to print the proposal docs

23:15.077 --> 23:17.433
for the big meet tomorrow at 5pm.

23:17.478 --> 23:23.077
Anyway, I'm in Dartmouth,
with a lovely young student girl.

23:23.120 --> 23:29.230
I just made the move, which went brilliantly.
Now we're probably gonna go to bed.

23:29.281 --> 23:31.637
See you tomorrow. Bye. >

23:34.883 --> 23:37.078
Mark, listen, I was just thinking.

23:37.123 --> 23:43.155
Don't get me wrong. I like you.
I think I really like you.

23:43.205 --> 23:45.242
And I really like you.

23:45.286 --> 23:50.236
It's just... it's late. I've had a few wines.

23:50.287 --> 23:53.564
I could hardly focus on the bog roll.

23:53.608 --> 23:55.645
Let's do this another night.

23:55.689 --> 23:56.838
Another night?

23:56.889 --> 23:59.609
'Fine. If I hadn't lied about everything.'

23:59.650 --> 24:04.486
No, it's got to be... It should be tonight.

24:04.531 --> 24:09.481
But we've both got to get up early.
It's Babylon at nine.

24:09.532 --> 24:15.131
Let's... tonight. I really feel
that the mood's... right tonight.

24:15.174 --> 24:20.967
We've got three more years.
Let's just... lie here and cuddle.

24:21.016 --> 24:25.374
Oh. Right. Nice cuddle.

24:29.138 --> 24:32.734
Hi. Oh, h... hello, Sophie.

24:33.739 --> 24:37.779
Yes, I'm sorry to have called you so late.

24:39.381 --> 24:44.695
I thought you might be interested
in how things were going for me.

24:44.742 --> 24:47.701
But you're not.

24:53.144 --> 24:56.296
See you after the lecture.

24:56.345 --> 24:59.418
Yeah. See you after the lecture.

25:02.667 --> 25:08.983
'At least I never had to watch her
recoil at my scrotal scar.'

25:09.029 --> 25:13.023
She would've done it. Given another
night or two. She would have.

25:13.070 --> 25:18.270
Yeah. So, another notch on the bedpost...

25:18.311 --> 25:19.301
sort of.

25:19.352 --> 25:22.948
'This is OK.
It's just a moment that'll haunt me forever.'

25:31.235 --> 25:36.151
<i>Paranoia, paranoia
Everybody's coming to get me</i>

25:36.196 --> 25:39.348
<i>Just say you never met me</i>

25:39.397 --> 25:42.231
<i>I'm running underground
With the moles</i>

25:42.278 --> 25:44.156
<i>Digging holes.</i>
