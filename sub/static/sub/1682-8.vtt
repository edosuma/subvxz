00:03.567 --> 00:05.767
<i>Kids, the secret to dating
is very simple:</i>

00:05.767 --> 00:07.334
<i>Be confident, be comfortable
in your skin,</i>

00:08.334 --> 00:10.067
<i>be assured of who you are.</i>

00:10.067 --> 00:12.400
<i>Uncle Barney was really good
at that last one,</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:16.567
<i>even though a lot of the time
who he was was someone else.</i>

00:18.667 --> 00:21.601
Hi. Do you see that guy
over there in the scuba suit?

00:23.367 --> 00:25.067
You thinking of going
and talking to him?

00:25.067 --> 00:26.167
No.

00:26.167 --> 00:28.367
Good. He's seriously
the biggest jerk

00:28.367 --> 00:30.133
on the face of the Earth.

00:30.133 --> 00:32.433
How do you know him?
Oh, he's one of my best friends.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.434
So what's with the scuba suit?

00:34.434 --> 00:36.234
Well, it's a long story.

00:36.234 --> 00:38.334
See, he just went through
a breakup...

00:39.034 --> 00:40.733
<i>There's two basic philosophies</i>

00:40.733 --> 00:42.733
<i>of how to handle yourself
after a breakup.</i>

00:42.733 --> 00:44.668
<i>Some people throw
themselves into...</i>

00:44.668 --> 00:47.267
My career. That's my number one
focus right now.

00:47.267 --> 00:48.767
From now on, no more dating.

00:48.767 --> 00:50.434
It's all about work.

00:50.434 --> 00:52.434
<i>While others throw
themselves into...</i>

00:52.434 --> 00:54.434
Every woman in New York City.

00:54.434 --> 00:58.000
That's right, Barney Stinson
is back on the market.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.501
Mothers, lock up your daughters.

00:59.501 --> 01:01.967
Daughters, lock up
your MILSWANCAs.

01:01.967 --> 01:03.900
MILSWANCAs?
Wait, I can get this.

01:03.900 --> 01:07.067
Mothers I'd Like To Sleep With
And Never Call Again.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.000
Correct!
Cile gets the square.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.700
Don't you think you're kinda
rushg back into this?

01:11.700 --> 01:14.668
Lily, since I started dating
Robin, there's a certain

01:14.668 --> 01:17.700
<i>thing I haven't used as much
as I would like to.</i>

01:17.700 --> 01:20.000
It's... kinda big,

01:20.000 --> 01:21.668
surprisingly heavy,

01:21.668 --> 01:24.700
kind of leathery,
and it's black.

01:24.700 --> 01:25.467
Huh?

01:25.467 --> 01:29.434
This, my friends...

01:29.434 --> 01:31.267
is The Playbook.

01:32.367 --> 01:36.134
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>

<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:46.134 --> 01:47.634
The Playbook contains

01:47.634 --> 01:50.100
every scam, con, hustle,

01:50.100 --> 01:52.401
hoodwink, gambit, flimflam,

01:52.401 --> 01:53.967
stratagem and bamboozle
I've ever used--

01:53.967 --> 01:56.833
or ever hope to use--
to pick up chicks

01:56.833 --> 02:00.201
and give them the business.

02:00.201 --> 02:01.700
Wow, you wrote
another book?

02:01.700 --> 02:06.000
Uh... we got a...
Stephen King over here.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.300
It's all in here.

02:08.300 --> 02:12.700
Everything from basic moves like
"The Don't Drink That."

02:14.568 --> 02:15.800
Whoa, don't drink that.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.634
I saw some guy
slip something in there.

02:17.634 --> 02:19.000
What? Who?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.467
Uh...

02:20.467 --> 02:22.334
that guy.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.301
Thank you.

02:29.067 --> 02:32.734
To more advanced maneuvers
like "The Mrs. Stinsfire."

02:34.501 --> 02:36.901
Now Kappas, after our
disciplinary hearing

02:36.901 --> 02:39.000
for lewd behavior last semester,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.534
we have been aigned
a new housemom.

02:41.534 --> 02:44.033
I'd like you to meet
Mrs. Stinsfire.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.901
Hello, girls!

02:50.000 --> 02:52.467
Wow. I can't picture

02:52.467 --> 02:54.801
a way that wouldn't work.

02:55.451 --> 02:57.917
What's
"The Loreo Von Matterhorn"?

02:57.917 --> 02:59.217
I'm glad you asked.

02:59.217 --> 03:01.084
"The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn"
will be

03:01.084 --> 03:03.251
my grand return to the stage.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.251
Or you know, the bed.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.351
Actually, my bed
is kind of on a stage.

03:07.351 --> 03:09.117
I put a platform underneath,
and got some lights going.

03:09.117 --> 03:11.551
It's a real production.
Barney exits!

03:12.750 --> 03:13.984
So, how about you,
Robin?

03:13.984 --> 03:15.150
You getting back
out there?

03:15.150 --> 03:16.484
Where is your playbook?

03:16.484 --> 03:17.651
My playbook?
Yeah.

03:17.651 --> 03:20.451
Bro, uh, two-volume
set, right here.

03:20.451 --> 03:21.984
It's a great read
actually.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.750
Yeah, I'm reading
it right now.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.384
Anyway, I told you already, I'm
taking a break from all that.

03:26.384 --> 03:29.117
Mm, mm. Marshall,
it's totally gonna happen.

03:29.117 --> 03:30.883
So gonna happen.
What's gonna happen?

03:30.883 --> 03:33.017
You're gonna fall in love.
So soon.

03:33.017 --> 03:35.417
Not likely I'm
focusing on my career.

03:35.417 --> 03:36.517
I'm done with dating.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.651
<i>Oh, okay, we playing
The Pyramid?</i>

03:37.651 --> 03:39.783
Okay, uh,
"Things people say

03:39.783 --> 03:41.750
right before they meet
the love of their life."

03:41.750 --> 03:42.984
Ooh! Kelly Harris,

03:42.984 --> 03:45.451
girl I went
to law school with said...

03:45.451 --> 03:47.017
Hey, law school'so hard,

03:47.017 --> 03:48.984
I just want to focus
on my studies.

03:48.984 --> 03:49.783
Six months later?

03:49.783 --> 03:51.718
<i>Married!</i>

03:51.718 --> 03:52.817
We, that's all
well and good...

03:52.817 --> 03:55.184
Travis Frenchroy, backup
bartender tells me...

03:55.184 --> 03:56.917
Oh, I'm so
over the whole dating game.

03:56.917 --> 03:59.950
<i>I just want to focus
on my Star Trek fan fiction.</i>

03:59.950 --> 04:00.783
Six months later...

04:00.783 --> 04:03.017
<i>Married!</i>

04:03.017 --> 04:04.718
May I respond?
Mm-hmm

04:04.718 --> 04:06.351
Well, that's all well
and good for them...

04:06.351 --> 04:09.917
Matthew Blitz,
accountant at my office says...

04:09.917 --> 04:12.618
Oh, I'm gonna die
single and alone.

04:12.618 --> 04:14.684
I might as well just focus
on this year's taxes.

04:14.684 --> 04:15.850
Six months later?

04:21.084 --> 04:23.150
Protest all you want,
but it's gonna happen.

04:23.150 --> 04:24.351
It's a law of nature.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.050
Lawyered. Of nature.

04:26.050 --> 04:28.284
Believe me, I'd love to have
no interest in a relationship.

04:28.284 --> 04:29.917
There's no way
I'd be single right now

04:29.917 --> 04:31.584
if I wanted to be single.

04:31.584 --> 04:33.950
Okay, now you're ready.
Ready for what?

04:33.950 --> 04:35.718
Three years ago,
this girl Shelly

04:35.718 --> 04:37.117
started teaching
at my school.

04:37.117 --> 04:38.684
The moment I saw
her, I was like,

04:38.684 --> 04:40.618
"This is the girl for Ted."

04:40.618 --> 04:42.017
Why am I just
hearing about her now?

04:42.017 --> 04:43.017
Ah...

04:43.017 --> 04:44.718
You know, I usually
hate being set up

04:44.718 --> 04:46.917
but this Ted just
sounds so great.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.217
Oh, he is.

04:48.217 --> 04:50.417
He's so sweet and thoughtful
and intelligent.

04:50.417 --> 04:51.750
Come on buddy!

04:51.750 --> 04:54.384
One more chicken finger
and the crown is yours!

04:55.484 --> 04:57.584
Hmm, I don't see him anywhere.

04:57.584 --> 04:59.718
He must be out
doing charity work.

04:59.718 --> 05:02.551
So, different bar?

05:02.551 --> 05:05.284
That girl with Lily's
pretty cute!

05:06.317 --> 05:07.950
<i>Oh, yeah she was cute.</i>

05:07.950 --> 05:11.217
Yeah, still is.
And now you're ready.

05:11.217 --> 05:12.684
Yeah, bro, now
you can fit like,

05:12.684 --> 05:14.517
three times as many
chicken fingers in your mouth.

05:14.517 --> 05:16.351
You know it.
Okay, I will set it up,

05:16.351 --> 05:19.184
but promise me you won't
do anything stupid.

05:19.184 --> 05:21.718
I promise I won't do
anything stupid.

05:21.718 --> 05:23.750
<i>And I kept that promise.</i>

05:23.750 --> 05:25.417
<i>But only because...</i>

05:25.417 --> 05:28.284
<i>she never showed up.</i>

05:30.750 --> 05:33.917
I know. I'm sorry,
I feel terrible.
You should feel teible!

05:33.917 --> 05:35.950
I do feel terrible! I do!
You should!

05:35.950 --> 05:38.351
You should!
You should!
I do, I do!

05:38.351 --> 05:39.984
I don't.

05:40.284 --> 05:41.250
Look, I was really

05:41.250 --> 05:42.384
looking forward to meeting Ted,

05:42.384 --> 05:44.450
but I got to the bar
an hour early

05:44.450 --> 05:47.083
and I met this amazing guy.

05:47.083 --> 05:48.551
Like, seriously amazing.

05:48.551 --> 05:50.751
And you met him at MacLaren's?

05:50.751 --> 05:53.484
Yeah, right at the bar.
What's his name?

05:53.484 --> 05:56.217
I shouldn't say.

05:56.217 --> 05:58.018
Oh, what the heck.

05:58.018 --> 06:00.851
It's Lorenzo Von Matterhorn!

06:02.552 --> 06:04.352
You son of a bitch.

06:10.317 --> 06:11.817
So, he hooked up
with Shelly?

06:11.817 --> 06:13.217
You must've been pissed.

06:13.217 --> 06:14.651
Damn straight.

06:14.651 --> 06:18.551
Barney, I've had Shelly set
aside for Ted for three years.

06:18.551 --> 06:20.417
Dude, Ted was not missing out.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.317
She's brainy and annoying,

06:22.317 --> 06:24.618
kind of boring in the sack.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.484
Oh, I guess she would've
been perfect for Ted.

06:26.484 --> 06:27.551
Oops.

06:27.551 --> 06:29.718
Ow! Ok.

06:29.718 --> 06:31.850
Had I known that
she was there to meet Ted,

06:31.850 --> 06:33.817
of course I wouldn't
have done it, but...

06:33.817 --> 06:36.817
given the circumstances,
I think Ted'll be proud of me.

06:36.817 --> 06:41.184
I pulled off
"The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn."

06:41.184 --> 06:43.618
Okay, what's the
Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?

06:43.618 --> 06:45.284
My question exactly.

06:45.284 --> 06:47.817
Okay, what's the
Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?

06:47.817 --> 06:50.883
Glad you asked.

06:50.883 --> 06:53.217
<i>To perform the
Lorenzo Von Matterhorn,</i>

06:53.217 --> 06:54.451
<i>here's what you'll need:</i>

06:54.451 --> 06:56.117
<i>Basic knowledge
of Web site design</i>

06:56.117 --> 06:58.217
<i>and a very unique fake name.</i>

06:58.217 --> 07:02.150
<i>So, think of your
fake name right now.</i>

07:02.150 --> 07:04.684
<i>Have you got it? Good.</i>

07:04.684 --> 07:05.984
<i>Now, select your target.</i>

07:05.984 --> 07:08.584
<i>Preferably a girl
with a real ni...</i>

07:08.584 --> 07:10.718
<i>phone.</i>

07:15.484 --> 07:18.050
Yeah, it's me.

07:18.050 --> 07:22.817
Do I know you?

07:22.817 --> 07:24.984
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

07:26.284 --> 07:28.517
Are you, like,
famous or something?

07:28.517 --> 07:32.451
Yes.

07:35.551 --> 07:37.718
What a refreshing
change of pace.

07:37.718 --> 07:38.783
Nice to meet you...

07:38.783 --> 07:40.684
Shelly.
Shelly.

07:40.684 --> 07:43.584
Once again,
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

07:43.584 --> 07:46.451
Spelled like it sounds
two "T"s.

07:46.451 --> 07:48.984
Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

07:48.984 --> 07:51.451
<i>Ciao.</i>

07:51.451 --> 07:52.984
<i>Then, as soon as you're gone,</i>

07:52.984 --> 07:54.750
<i>she gets out her phone</i>

07:54.750 --> 07:58.451
<i>and does an Internet search
for Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.</i>

07:58.451 --> 08:00.718
<i>And that's when she discovers.</i>

08:00.718 --> 08:02.684
<i>a series of fake Web sites,</i>

08:02.684 --> 08:04.684
<i>all devoted
to the incredible life</i>

08:04.684 --> 08:07.117
<i>of Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.</i>

08:07.117 --> 08:08.384
<i>There's the fake
business article</i>

08:08.384 --> 08:09.718
<i>about Lorenzo,
the reclusive billionaire.</i>

08:09.718 --> 08:11.117
<i>The fake Explorers Club
newsletter</i>

08:11.117 --> 08:12.883
<i>describing his balloon trek
to the North Pole</i>

08:12.883 --> 08:14.917
<i>as a feat of pure
daring and imagination.</i>

08:14.917 --> 08:16.317
<i>The fake medical journal</i>

08:16.317 --> 08:18.084
<i>featuring the heartbreaking
story of doctors telling him</i>

08:18.084 --> 08:20.750
<i>penis reduction surgery
isn't an option.</i>

08:20.750 --> 08:21.050
<i>And by the time you get back..</i>

08:21.250 --> 08:24.818
Hi, Shelly,
uh, I hate to be forward,

08:24.818 --> 08:26.117
but can I buy you
a cup of coffee?

08:26.117 --> 08:28.350
Yes! Please.

08:29.350 --> 08:31.250
What does coffee go
for these days, $50?

08:31.550 --> 08:33.951
Oh, Lorenzo.

08:33.951 --> 08:36.817
<i>And it is on.</i>

08:38.484 --> 08:40.549
That's awful.

08:40.549 --> 08:42.784
You realize you broke
her heart, right?

08:42.784 --> 08:44.118
She's inconsolable.

08:44.118 --> 08:46.618
Why would she be inconsolable?

08:46.618 --> 08:48.951
Lorenzo's balloon
won't disappear over the Arctic

08:48.951 --> 08:50.450
for another week.

08:50.450 --> 08:52.918
The only way she would
be upset is if someone

08:52.918 --> 08:55.018
told her it was all
a bunch of lies.

08:55.018 --> 08:57.417
It was all just
a bunch of lies?

08:57.417 --> 08:59.250
It was all just a bunch of lies.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.417
The balloon expedition?
Lies!

09:01.417 --> 09:03.350
The man-made island
shaped like his face

09:03.350 --> 09:05.517
off the coast of Dubai?
Lies!

09:05.517 --> 09:08.150
Finishing third
in the laser tag competition?

09:08.150 --> 09:09.617
Li-- Oh, actually,
that one's true.

09:09.617 --> 09:10.918
I went to that.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.050
You went to the Vatican?

09:12.050 --> 09:13.317
Lies!

09:14.450 --> 09:17.050
Oh, my God!

09:17.050 --> 09:19.651
Well, I hope you're
happy with yourself.

09:19.651 --> 09:22.417
What?
You broke that girl's heart.

09:22.417 --> 09:24.150
Me?
You!

09:25.083 --> 09:26.918
She'll probably never
trust a guy again.

09:26.918 --> 09:28.551
You ruined her for Ted.

09:28.551 --> 09:31.817
Not to mention
Julio Von Matterhorn,

09:31.817 --> 09:33.384
Lorenzo's twin brother.

09:34.617 --> 09:35.851
Can you believe that?

09:35.851 --> 09:37.317
He blames me

09:37.317 --> 09:38.551
Oh, and by the way, Ted,

09:38.551 --> 09:40.050
I bet she'd still
go out with you.

09:40.050 --> 09:41.350
Hm, let me think.

09:41.350 --> 09:43.417
Do I want to go out with
a girl Barney hooked up with?

09:43.417 --> 09:44.884
Guys, help me out
with the harmonies.
Sure.

09:44.884 --> 09:46.684
Hell no...

09:46.684 --> 09:50.918
Hell no...

09:52.150 --> 09:53.951
Well, you must be a
little bothered by this.

09:53.951 --> 09:55.484
Well, it's his life.

09:55.484 --> 09:58.751
Look, if these girls are dumb
enough to fall for this crap,

09:58.751 --> 09:59.984
Agreed.

09:59.984 --> 10:02.250
Have you seen the one
there labeled "The SNASA"?

10:04.683 --> 10:06.650
Wow, you're an astronaut?

10:06.650 --> 10:08.184
Shh!

10:08.184 --> 10:11.650
I'm actually in a top secret
government space program

10:11.650 --> 10:16.384
called Secret NASA
or SNASA.

10:16.384 --> 10:19.351
Wow, SNASA.
Mm-mm.

10:19.351 --> 10:20.683
Do you go to the Moon and stuff?

10:20.683 --> 10:22.317
Well, not the Moon
you're familiar with,

10:22.317 --> 10:25.783
though I have been
to the Smoon.

10:26.583 --> 10:29.583
Wow, the Smoon.

10:33.151 --> 10:35.251
If you fall for that one,
my heart breaks for you,

10:35.251 --> 10:37.717
but I'm sorry,
you're a smoron.

10:38.384 --> 10:39.517
So, what happens next?

10:39.517 --> 10:40.817
Well...

10:40.817 --> 10:43.151
Come on, Barney,
you just...

10:44.750 --> 10:47.418
You just got out of an
honest to God relationship.

10:47.418 --> 10:49.051
You're a real boy now.

10:49.051 --> 10:51.517
You can't go back
to these cheap tricks.

10:51.517 --> 10:53.184
Cheap tricks?!

10:53.184 --> 10:55.184
Not one of these
is a cheap trick.

10:55.184 --> 10:57.184
Except for "The Cheap Trick."

10:58.217 --> 11:00.517
I'm the bass player for Cheap Trick.

11:03.084 --> 11:06.284
And even that one involves
expensive hair extensions.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.884
Now, if you don't mind,

11:08.884 --> 11:10.851
I am off to prepare for
tonight's main event.

11:10.851 --> 11:14.051
I will be performing
"The He's Not Coming."

11:14.051 --> 11:16.250
Glad you asked.

11:17.884 --> 11:19.317
<i>To perform
"The He's Not Coming,"</i>

11:19.317 --> 11:20.617
<i>here's what you'll need:</i>

11:20.617 --> 11:22.517
<i>The observation deck
of the Empire State Building.</i>

11:22.517 --> 11:23.684
<i>Are you there?</i>

11:23.684 --> 11:25.250
<i>Good.</i>

11:25.250 --> 11:27.317
<i>For generations,
this has been the spot</i>

11:27.317 --> 11:29.517
<i>New Yorkers have chosen
for their romantic reunions</i>

11:29.517 --> 11:31.617
<i>with long-estranged lovers,
so all you have to do</i>

11:31.617 --> 11:35.617
<i>is walk up to every girl you see
and say... "He's not coming."</i>

11:35.617 --> 11:36.817
What are you
talking about?

11:36.817 --> 11:38.584
Never mind.

11:38.584 --> 11:40.051
He's not coming.

11:42.617 --> 11:44.584
He's not coming.

11:44.584 --> 11:46.851
She's not coming?

11:47.650 --> 11:48.951
Sorry.

11:48.951 --> 11:51.084
<i>Until sooner or later...</i>

11:53.051 --> 11:54.350
He's not coming.

11:54.350 --> 11:57.751
He's not?

11:57.751 --> 11:59.517
But we agreed.

11:59.517 --> 12:01.517
We always said
we'd meet here.

12:01.517 --> 12:03.051
On this night.

12:04.118 --> 12:07.151
I'm such a fool.

12:07.151 --> 12:09.550
Shh, shh, shh...

12:14.051 --> 12:15.751
All right, I'm going
to go get the paper.

12:15.751 --> 12:17.717
More like,
go get a husband.
Totally.

12:17.717 --> 12:18.717
Okay, you guys need

12:18.717 --> 12:20.051
to stop that, seriously.

12:20.051 --> 12:22.084
The last thing I am looking for
right now is a relationship.

12:22.084 --> 12:23.851
Uh-huh. When you
pick up that newspaper,

12:23.851 --> 12:25.517
be sure to check
the wedding announcements.

12:25.517 --> 12:26.851
For yours.

12:26.851 --> 12:28.917
Robin, it's like this.

12:28.917 --> 12:30.450
Do you have any idea how
many times in my life

12:30.450 --> 12:31.584
I've gone to t freezer

12:31.584 --> 12:33.051
looking for frozen waffles
and not found them?

12:33.051 --> 12:34.584
Thousands?
Millions.

12:34.584 --> 12:37.550
But when I go to the freezer
looking for a Popsicle--

12:37.550 --> 12:40.184
or the remote control because
Lily and I are having a fight

12:40.184 --> 12:42.218
and she's hidden it there--
you know what I fi?

12:42.951 --> 12:43.951
Frozen waffles.

12:43.951 --> 12:44.917
That's how it works.

12:44.917 --> 12:46.784
You go out there looking
for a paper,

12:46.784 --> 12:48.417
you're coming back
with frozen waffles.

12:48.417 --> 12:52.417
And, in this case, frozen waffles
is a guy.

12:52.417 --> 12:55.717
Also, could you pick up
some frozen waffles?

12:55.717 --> 12:59.218
In that case, frozen waffles...

12:59.218 --> 13:01.450
are frozen waffles.

13:02.617 --> 13:04.484
Guys, code red! Emergency.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.550
Lock down. Nobody's leaving.

13:06.550 --> 13:07.450
Whoa, what happened?

13:07.450 --> 13:09.118
I tried "The He's
Not Coming,"

13:09.118 --> 13:11.218
and it worked.
Gangbusters.

13:11.218 --> 13:12.784
You should have
seen this girl.

13:12.784 --> 13:15.051
Bang, ping,
pa-dowga-donk.

13:15.051 --> 13:16.118
Okay, I'm leaving.

13:17.584 --> 13:19.118
So, we get up to my place,

13:19.118 --> 13:20.984
and I go into my room
to set up the camera--

13:20.984 --> 13:22.951
to light the candles--

13:22.951 --> 13:24.517
and when I come out,

13:24.517 --> 13:28.151
she's gone,
and so is The Playbook!

13:28.151 --> 13:31.617
I think we all know
who is responsible for this.

13:31.617 --> 13:32.951
Yeah, we do.

13:32.951 --> 13:34.017
Yeah.

13:34.017 --> 13:35.417
Al-Qaeda.

13:35.417 --> 13:37.550
No, you idiot.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.517
It was me.

13:41.518 --> 13:43.518
You son of a bitch.

13:50.010 --> 13:52.143
Wow, you stole
The Playbook?

13:52.143 --> 13:54.711
So, the girl on the
Empire State Building?

13:54.711 --> 13:56.344
A friend of mine--
an actress.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.843
An actress.

13:57.843 --> 13:59.210
Of course.

13:59.210 --> 14:01.311
That explains her impeccable
diction and her sluttiness.

14:02.112 --> 14:04.412
Barney, I've got half a mind
to take that playbook

14:04.511 --> 14:07.311
and put it up on the internet
for the whole world to see.

14:07.311 --> 14:10.177
You wouldn't.
I won't, as long as you agree

14:10.177 --> 14:13.210
to no more scams, no more cons,
no more hustles,

14:13.210 --> 14:15.177
no more hoodwinks,
no more gambits,

14:15.177 --> 14:17.711
no more stratagems
and no more bamboozles.

14:19.044 --> 14:20.877
I notice you
left out flimflams.

14:20.877 --> 14:22.477
No more flimflams!
Damn it.

14:23.544 --> 14:24.710
Oh, my God.

14:24.710 --> 14:26.744
I-I'm sorry to interrupt,
but look at this.

14:29.111 --> 14:30.844
No.

14:32.677 --> 14:35.077
I got left at the altar.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.777
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

14:40.777 --> 14:42.644
I wonder if that would work.

14:42.644 --> 14:44.410
That's not even
the worst one in here.

14:44.410 --> 14:47.278
Have you guys seen, uh,
"My Penis Grants Wishes"?

14:50.077 --> 14:52.244
Really?
A genie comes t of it?

14:52.244 --> 14:54.578
Only if you rub it hard enough.

14:56.844 --> 14:58.044
So, then, what happened?

14:58.044 --> 14:59.444
It says here he breaks
into song,

14:59.444 --> 15:01.610
and then the furniture comes
to life and dances with him.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.211
It's not very well
thought out.

15:03.211 --> 15:05.177
It's no
"Mrs. Stinsfire."

15:05.177 --> 15:06.677
No, what happened
in real life?

15:06.677 --> 15:08.810
Well, a few
hours later...

15:16.944 --> 15:18.344
You know,
I heard it was gonna rain.

15:18.344 --> 15:19.978
If anyone's interested,

15:19.978 --> 15:22.510
I will be at MacLaren's Pub
performing a play

15:22.510 --> 15:25.410
out of The Playbook entitled "The Scuba diver"

15:25.410 --> 15:27.844
That is all.

15:28.944 --> 15:30.711
Okay, that's it.

15:30.711 --> 15:33.711
I'm putting The Playbook up
on the Internet.

15:33.711 --> 15:36.210
Baby, can you put The Playbook
up on the Internet?

15:36.210 --> 15:37.444
Yeah. Of course, baby,

15:37.444 --> 15:38.911
but here's the...
here's the weird thing.

15:38.911 --> 15:41.277
I have literally been through
this book cover to cover.

15:41.277 --> 15:43.911
There is no play in here
called "The Scuba Diver."

15:45.078 --> 15:46.544
<i>Oh.</i>

15:46.544 --> 15:50.410
So, now you guys want to know
what "The Scuba Diver" is.

15:50.410 --> 15:52.844
<i>Well, it was</i>

15:52.844 --> 15:54.811
on the last page
of The Playbook,

15:54.811 --> 15:57.544
but I ripped it out
just in case.

15:57.545 --> 15:58.745
Don't worry, though,

15:58.745 --> 16:00.577
You're about to see it
in action.

16:00.577 --> 16:02.477
See the blond over there
by the bar?

16:04.877 --> 16:06.777
Tizzarget acquizzired.

16:06.777 --> 16:09.077
Barney, don't do this.

16:09.077 --> 16:10.211
You're so...

16:10.211 --> 16:11.244
Ah, give it a rest, pest.

16:11.244 --> 16:12.377
If anyone
should be mad,

16:12.377 --> 16:13.610
it should be Rob.

16:13.610 --> 16:14.877
She loves The Playbook.

16:14.877 --> 16:17.244
I don't love
The Playbook.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.310
What are you talk...?

16:18.310 --> 16:19.777
The Playbook-- it's gold.

16:19.777 --> 16:21.410
You got to admit
it's pretty spectacular.

16:21.410 --> 16:23.977
Look, Barney, we just broke up.

16:23.977 --> 16:27.244
I mean, yes,
the costumes are cute, but...

16:27.244 --> 16:29.410
we just broke up.

16:31.377 --> 16:34.011
Well, I didn't...
I didn't know you felt that way.

16:35.011 --> 16:36.677
I guess I've been so wrapped up

16:36.677 --> 16:37.977
in my own stuff that I...

16:37.977 --> 16:39.410
Oh, crap,
she's looking over he.

16:39.410 --> 16:41.377
Quick, everyone,
scatter.

16:43.178 --> 16:45.011
That's it.

16:46.443 --> 16:49.844
Hi. You see at guy
over there in the scuba suit?

16:49.844 --> 16:51.944
And that brings us
to rig now.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.644
Wow.

16:53.644 --> 16:55.111
But... wait.

16:55.111 --> 16:57.410
So, why is he
wearing scuba gear?

16:57.410 --> 16:58.477
We don't know.

16:58.477 --> 17:01.144
And it's killing us,
Claire.

17:01.144 --> 17:02.544
It's killing us!

17:02.544 --> 17:04.278
Let's go ask him.

17:07.343 --> 17:08.810
So, what's
"The Scuba Diver"?

17:08.810 --> 17:10.911
And this iClaire, by the way.

17:11.911 --> 17:12.944
Hello, Claire.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.644
My name is Lieutenant
Frank Lyman.

17:14.644 --> 17:18.211
I train bomb sniffing
dolphins for the Balt...

17:18.977 --> 17:20.577
You know what?

17:20.577 --> 17:22.278
I'm... I can't...

17:22.278 --> 17:24.044
I can't...
I can't do ts.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.510
Robin...

17:26.343 --> 17:27.477
I'm so sorry.

17:27.477 --> 17:29.644
I guess
this breakup's

17:29.644 --> 17:32.343
been tougher on me
than I thought.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.510
I think
this playbook

17:33.510 --> 17:35.410
was just a way to take my mind

17:37.011 --> 17:37.011
It's okay.

17:37.011 --> 17:38.577
It's been tough on me, too.

17:38.577 --> 17:39.711
I mean, look at me.

17:39.711 --> 17:41.210
I've sworn off relationships.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.377
She's so about
to get married.

17:43.377 --> 17:44.544
I got to work
on my toast.

17:44.544 --> 17:45.978
I got to make
sure my tux fits.

17:45.978 --> 17:48.477
I will bang your heads together
like coconuts.

17:48.477 --> 17:49.911
Barney, I'm so glad

17:49.911 --> 17:51.444
you're stopping this.

17:51.444 --> 17:53.978
And-and, frankly,
the real Barney

17:53.978 --> 17:56.644
is way cooler than any
of the fake Barney's

17:56.644 --> 17:57.611
in this any book.

17:57.611 --> 17:58.744
Oh, is that right?

17:58.744 --> 18:00.310
Claire, you've
probably heard a lot

18:00.310 --> 18:01.478
about the real
Barney tonight.

18:00.978 --> 18:03.310
Want to grab a
cup of coffee?

18:03.310 --> 18:04.711
Claire, before you
turn him down,

18:04.711 --> 18:08.311
I-I think you should know
that under this neoprene suit

18:08.311 --> 18:09.810
with what appears to be

18:09.810 --> 18:11.478
a tube sock stuffed
in the crotch.

18:11.478 --> 18:13.111
Can of Pringles,
but go on.

18:14.610 --> 18:16.010
...is an amazing guy.

18:16.010 --> 18:17.511
He's fun

18:17.511 --> 18:19.610
and one of my
best friends.

18:19.610 --> 18:21.643
And he landed
this hottie.

18:22.511 --> 18:23.977
He's a good guy.

18:25.411 --> 18:27.177
Come on, Claire,
go out with him.

18:27.177 --> 18:28.444
It's just a cup
of coffee, right?

18:28.444 --> 18:30.478
Right? Come on.
- Yeah.
- Can't hurt.
