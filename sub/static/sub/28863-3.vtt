Beautiful.

Well, we say to-mah-to,
but, uh, yes.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.712
Hmm.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.481
Well, I'd never seen one before.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.817
And it's not an apple, you know.

Did you see that

The tomato that is not an apple?

22:48.568 --> 22:50.102
I...

22:55.908 --> 22:58.411
There's a Greek word.
Telepathy.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.980
Which means "distant feeling
or perception."

23:03.049 --> 23:04.751
I have that skill.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.754
I don't know why.

23:07.787 --> 23:11.190
I can hear thoughts.
Memories.

23:11.223 --> 23:15.227
But it-it occurred to me
that there should be rules.

23:15.261 --> 23:18.831
-Mm.
-People deserve their privacy.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.703
So I don't pry
when I'm in there.

23:23.736 --> 23:27.740
I just... I try to help.

23:27.774 --> 23:30.376
Are there others like you?

23:30.409 --> 23:31.844
Maybe. I don't know.

23:34.647 --> 23:35.948
Do you think it's odd?

23:35.982 --> 23:38.217
(chuckles) A little.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.220
(both laugh)

23:41.253 --> 23:43.255

23:48.094 --> 23:50.229
I'm not well, you know.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.699
Neither am I.

23:56.435 --> 24:00.006
I've seen blood on fire.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.147
We can change.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.917
People don't change.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.852
I don't believe that.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.321
That's sweet.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.259

-Anything.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.808
David?

39:02.841 --> 39:04.342
David...

39:04.376 --> 39:06.712
(panting)

39:06.745 --> 39:08.947
Stop it.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.918
Stop it.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.386
Stop it!

39:19.391 --> 39:21.393
(David stops crying)

39:24.195 --> 39:25.431
(gasps)

39:25.464 --> 39:27.933
Mommy.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.006
DAVID:
Mommy?

39:35.040 --> 39:37.042
No, no, no!
(screams)

39:38.744 --> 39:40.746
(David screaming)

39:46.952 --> 39:48.454
Oh!

39:48.487 --> 39:51.089
(groaning)

39:58.430 --> 39:59.798
Are you okay?

39:59.831 --> 40:01.967
I don't understand.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.536
Why-why couldn't she hear me?

40:04.570 --> 40:07.873
I was trying to help her.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.208
We have to go back.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.810
-Open the door.
-I can't.

40:11.843 --> 40:15.080
You have to. Get up.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.115
Get up.

40:36.635 --> 40:39.571
I'm sorry.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.272
It was too far.

40:46.044 --> 40:49.314
I've got to sleep.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.585
No. No, no,

40:53.619 --> 40:56.287
no, no, no, no, no.
No, no. No. Wait, no.

40:56.321 --> 40:59.190
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Wake up.

40:59.224 --> 41:02.661
Wait. We have to go back!
Come on.

41:06.331 --> 41:10.201
We have to go back!

41:10.235 --> 41:13.438
(screams)

41:13.471 --> 41:15.206
Love, wake up.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.508
Whatever it is, it's gone now.

41:16.542 --> 41:19.310
Please. Wake up. Wa...

41:31.657 --> 41:34.159
Darling, please.

41:34.192 --> 41:37.028
Wake up. Please!

41:43.034 --> 41:45.003
(Charles crying quietly)

41:45.036 --> 41:47.038
(wind whistling)

41:56.848 --> 41:58.850
(cooing)

42:05.223 --> 42:07.192
(David crying)

42:07.225 --> 42:09.160
Shh...

42:09.194 --> 42:11.196
-(speaking Farsi)
-*

42:16.635 --> 42:18.369
My angel.

42:18.403 --> 42:20.405
-(speaking Farsi)
-(David coos)

42:22.708 --> 42:24.676
Hmm.

42:24.710 --> 42:26.612
(David cries)

42:26.645 --> 42:29.781
My beautiful boy.

44:37.943 --> 44:39.444
MAN:
Now I get it.
