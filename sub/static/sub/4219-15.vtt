WEBVTT

00:00.084 --> 00:02.335
Listen. You didn't hear this from me.

00:02.461 --> 00:04.003
I don't know the whole story,

00:04.129 --> 00:06.798
but Keeler's got a hook in somebody
higher up the food chain.

00:06.924 --> 00:09.550
- They're telling us to cut him loose.
- Do something, Erin, or I will.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.595
Let's go, Dawson! You're falling behind.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.014
I got to get through
this damn test in seven minutes.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.432
Sorry.

00:16.558 --> 00:17.892
Maybe it just wasn't meant to be.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.728
Deep down, are you a firefighter or not?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.188
Three-month suspension.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.774
What? Did you tell them
the whole story?

00:24.900 --> 00:26.818
I requested Dawson to replace me.

00:26.944 --> 00:31.572
Lieutenant Casey, I'm Rebecca Jones.
I'm the new candidate on Truck 81.

00:38.831 --> 00:42.083
What's the prognosis?
Can we take you off the injured list?

00:42.209 --> 00:46.963
Yeah. Just don't expect me
to break any pass receiving records.

00:47.089 --> 00:50.717
Look on the bright side.
You're going back home to 51.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.802
It's a stroke of luck
your old spot opened up.

00:53.470 --> 00:57.265
Luck? Going back to my old house
with my tail between my legs?

00:57.391 --> 00:58.975
Come on, nobody's looking
at it that way.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.268
I am.

01:01.937 --> 01:04.355
Look, I want to be a firefighter, Matt.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.065
I got a taste of it, and I liked it.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.067
I get it. I do.

01:08.193 --> 01:12.113
But Chicago is damn lucky to have you
on board that ambulance.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.409
Is this about Jones joining truck?

01:16.535 --> 01:18.536
No, not even remotely.

01:18.662 --> 01:22.039
She busted her ass to get where she is.
Good on her.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.047
Hey, Dawson. Back in the saddle, huh?

01:30.174 --> 01:31.257
Eh, it's temporary.

01:31.383 --> 01:34.135
Damn straight, mama. You're gonna
show them how it's done next time.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.386
Thanks.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.888
Hey. Good morning, Lieutenant.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.015
Oh, please, he passed the test.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.350
Let's wait and see if the promotion
ever comes through.

01:41.477 --> 01:44.562
Ha, ha, ha. I'd be more worried
about this new candidate.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.148
Hey, is she ever gonna grace us
with her presence today?

01:47.274 --> 01:48.691
I'm sure this chick is awesome,

01:48.817 --> 01:50.568
but having a woman around
will change things.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.487
- Oh, gee, thanks.
- You know what I mean.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.323
Having a woman in the truck?
You don't know what goes on in there.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.909
- The jokes we crack.
- The smells we produce.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.203
- I can imagine.
- No. No, you can't.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.789
You can't.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.503
Hey, you want to go do inventory?
I bet you missed that.

02:08.629 --> 02:09.879
Oh, how I missed it.

02:10.756 --> 02:11.881
Truck 81?

02:14.551 --> 02:18.721
I'm your new candidate.
Jones. Rebecca. Either one's fine.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.973
- Welcome aboard, Jones.
- Thanks.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.394
Listen, I know what you guys are
thinking. A woman on truck?

02:25.521 --> 02:26.938
What is the world coming to, right?

02:27.064 --> 02:29.023
- That's not at all what we...
- Yes, you are.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.608
And I don't blame you.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.402
Women can be a pain in the ass.

02:33.529 --> 02:36.072
Look, I have three brothers.
I'm no delicate flower.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.740
I'm not expecting special treatment.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.534
And to show you
I can be one of the guys,

02:39.660 --> 02:42.620
- I brought donuts this morning.
- Fantastic.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.628
They were delicious.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.464
- Oh!
- So, there are no donuts?

03:02.391 --> 03:05.601
You want to go fill the tank
before we get any calls?

03:05.727 --> 03:07.228
Good idea.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.400
- Hey, be safe out there, babe.
- You, too.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.280
Candidate Jones.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.325
- Good morning, Lieutenant Casey.
- Ready to meet the Chief?

03:28.500 --> 03:31.168
Hey, have you, uh, spoken
to Detective Lindsay?

03:31.295 --> 03:34.881
- Yeah.
- So? Have they, uh, nailed Keeler yet?

03:36.049 --> 03:38.801
Turns out, Vince Keeler is cooperating
in some big joint investigation

03:38.927 --> 03:42.096
between ATF, FBI, Smokey the Bear...

03:42.222 --> 03:43.973
What's this have to do with Katie?

03:44.099 --> 03:47.643
The Bureau Chief won't let Voight's unit
touch Keeler without solid evidence.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.521
Doesn't sound like anything short
of a confession is going to do it.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.607
- So, he...
- I know, Otis.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.901
He just gets away with
kidnapping and assault?

03:55.027 --> 03:58.404
Look, Lindsay assures me,
CPD is not giving up.

03:58.530 --> 04:02.867
They're doing everything they can. In
the meantime, I think it's best we just

04:02.993 --> 04:05.870
- move past it. You know?
- Yeah.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.165
OK.

04:16.340 --> 04:17.506
Clarke.

04:18.050 --> 04:21.135
Um, I'm gonna need a little help
with something, a personal favor.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.721
- Name it.
- Not talking about moving furniture...

04:23.847 --> 04:26.807
- And with your recent legal troubles...
- Spit it out.

04:28.352 --> 04:31.228
Vince Keeler's gonna
make a clean getaway.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.648
And I can't live with that.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.233
I'm free tomorrow night.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.655
As a candidate,
you're here to learn.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.241
That means, keep your eyes and ears open
and your mouth shut.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.827
We're going to spend some time today
drilling various tools,

04:46.954 --> 04:49.038
show you where things are stored.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.582
When we go to an incident,
I want you glued to my hip.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.502
I stop walking,
I want you bumping into my ass.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.672
Yes, Lieutenant.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.842
Ms. Jones, I know I speak
for the entire house when I say

05:01.969 --> 05:04.220
that 51 is proud to welcome
a female firefighter.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.931
I will see to it that you are treated
with the dignity and respect

05:07.057 --> 05:09.183
- that you deserve.
- Thank you, Chief.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.852
In return, you will treat this job
with the dignity and respect

05:11.979 --> 05:13.854
- that it deserves.
- Of course.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.941
You impressed a lot of people
at the academy, Ms. Jones.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.651
But out there...

05:20.237 --> 05:23.864
...that's real life. It's not a training
exercise, it's not a pop quiz.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.783
There are no shortcuts here.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.577
Meaning, sir?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.039
Just what I said, Candidate.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.001
If you learn nothing else today,
know this.

05:35.127 --> 05:38.754
You can always take my word
at face value.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.843
Truck 81,
Squad Three, Ambulance 61.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.386
That's us.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.652
- Shake a leg, guys.
- You're in my seat.

06:03.655 --> 06:07.408
- That's my seat.
- Out of my seat.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.536
Hey, does Main know 61 isn't here?

06:10.662 --> 06:14.498
They'll catch the call over the radio,
probably beat us to the scene.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.922
Did you call an ambulance?

06:22.049 --> 06:23.883
There's somebody
stuck in the clothing drop.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.385
I heard them calling for help.
I think it's a kid.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.803
Hello?

06:27.929 --> 06:30.264
Fire department! You OK in there?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.849
They were in there
a few minutes ago.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.268
Maybe they climbed out
when you weren't looking.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.394
I don't know.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.023
Hey, anybody home?

06:39.816 --> 06:42.068
OK. Get your skinny ass up there.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.988
Hello? Hello?

06:51.119 --> 06:52.328
I don't see anybody in here.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.956
Let's call off Squad and 81, save them
the trouble of coming out here.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.709
I don't know.
I don't like the feel of this.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.669
Let me take a look.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.554
- Dawson, what are you doing?
- Dawson!

07:15.018 --> 07:16.310
- I got her!
- What?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.395
She's not breathing!

07:32.410 --> 07:34.954
Dawson, hot packs coming your way.
Any respiration at all?

07:35.080 --> 07:37.331
Barely. Agonal breathing.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.209
Alright, the guys are going to get you
out of here in no time, OK?

07:40.335 --> 07:41.669
Yeah.

07:43.547 --> 07:46.465
What happened, hon? You climb in here
looking for some warm clothes?

07:54.391 --> 07:56.725
- Where's Dawson?
- I'm in here!

07:56.852 --> 07:58.644
Start warming up that IV just in case.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.188
This was all her idea.
I had nothing to do with it.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.607
Guys, we got to get
this girl out of here!

08:03.733 --> 08:07.611
I think we got this.
Herrmann. Let's get the saw.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.950
Where is she going?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.330
Whoa.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.041
A lot heavier than the ones
we trained on.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.002
Candidate,
is your name Herrmann?

08:23.128 --> 08:26.380
- Just trying to help, sir.
- Blade's all jacked up.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.384
- Clarke! Grab our saw.
- OK.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.763
Jones, stand over here
and don't touch a damn thing.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.731
Gonna be another minute,
Dawson! Sorry!

08:44.941 --> 08:46.901
Shay, where's that IV?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.029
- Here's the IV.
- OK?

08:50.155 --> 08:51.739
Yeah.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.087
I need blankets and a backboard,
right now! Let's move!

09:07.214 --> 09:08.589
On it!

09:18.058 --> 09:21.435
So, we're thinking, tomorrow night.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.146
And listen,
I know it's a lot to ask you.

09:24.272 --> 09:27.566
You shouldn't feel obligated.
But we could use you.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.111
What about Mills? You gonna ask him?

09:31.238 --> 09:33.322
No. No boy scouts.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.158
I guess 30 days in the lockup
wasn't enough for you?

09:36.284 --> 09:38.494
Let's just not get caught.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.710
Lieutenant Severide, how's it going?

09:46.836 --> 09:49.129
- Hey, welcome to 51, Jones.
- Thanks.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.758
Candidate, I believe the kitchen trash
is getting full.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.219
I'll take care of it, sir.

09:56.972 --> 10:00.307
- What am I dealing with here?
- Jones?

10:01.184 --> 10:05.145
She's smart, she's aggressive,

10:05.272 --> 10:08.440
she's talented, but...

10:10.360 --> 10:13.153
She also has a truly massive chip
on her shoulder.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.322
She might make a great firefighter
someday,

10:15.448 --> 10:18.075
but it'll take patience.
I tried to bounce her from the academy,

10:18.201 --> 10:20.786
but her big shot daddy
put the kibosh on that one.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.789
- You're telling me this now?
- You just asked now.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.842
Oh, hey, Connie. The union is
sending over some paperwork for me.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.553
I'm going to need you
to sign for that. Thanks.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.976
You're poking the bear, Mouch.
We've warned you about that.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.687
Get outta here. Connie loves me.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.189
Oh, hey, Jonesy, just a heads up.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.276
If lunch isn't on the table
at 12:00 sharp,

10:52.402 --> 10:56.113
- the natives start to get restless.
- And by natives, he means himself.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.157
Duly noted.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.118
In the meantime, Lieutenant Casey
said I'd be running drills today.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.203
I'd love to get started on that.

11:05.373 --> 11:10.002
- Don't all jump at once. Otis?
- I got a lot on my mind right now.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.546
OK. So, who's gonna drill me?

11:12.672 --> 11:15.341
I'm not touching that
with a 10-foot-pole.

11:15.467 --> 11:19.011
Ten? I heard it was more
like four-and-a-half.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.181
Hey, that is inappropriate.

11:22.307 --> 11:25.517
Seriously, guys? I thought this was
supposed to be a busy house.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.353
It's called downtime.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.897
Well, I don't feel like
sitting on my ass.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.484
Could someone at least show me
where the weight room is?

11:33.610 --> 11:37.404
You got energy to burn?
Right this way.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.704
Here you go. Alright!

11:46.456 --> 11:49.249
Showers haven't been scrubbed
since Mills made squad.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.085
Should be quite the workout.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.215
Great.

11:56.716 --> 12:00.302
That was a nice save, Dawson. Seriously.
I was ready to cancel the alarm.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.263
That girl wouldn't have been discovered
for days if you hadn't been there.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.474
- Stop patronizing me.
- I'm serious.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.059
- Seriously patronizing.
- Uh-uh.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.937
Uh-huh.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.681
Hey, how'd your, uh...
How'd your first call on truck go?

12:45.807 --> 12:47.933
You're funny.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.644
Your boyfriend tell you
about me dropping the saw?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.980
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.858
Right.

12:55.984 --> 12:59.319
Look, I'm really sorry that you didn't
make the cut, Dawson. I am.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.989
- But it's not my fault.
- No, I never said it was.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.783
So I hope you're not using your
sexy time with Lieutenant Casey

13:04.909 --> 13:08.871
to talk trash about me.
Because if you are, you and me?

13:08.997 --> 13:12.416
We're gonna have a problem.

13:20.341 --> 13:20.591
Why didn't you tell me you were
studying? I'm offended by that.

13:20.592 --> 13:23.385
Why didn't you tell me you were
studying? I'm offended by that.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.763
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.975
Besides, I figured I was
just gonna fail again.

13:30.727 --> 13:34.521
I guess I underestimated
the power of negative thinking.

13:34.647 --> 13:38.025
Well, it is a big step forward.
Are you ready?

13:38.151 --> 13:42.279
I'm not eager to leave 51,
but then again,

13:42.405 --> 13:46.992
it's feeling a little crowded on truck,
if you know what I mean.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.331
Well, your promotion may not
come through for a few months.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.626
- Can you wait?
- I've waited this long, haven't I?

13:55.752 --> 13:57.461
Yes, you have.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.256
Good job.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.468
Go on, get out of here.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.476
Smells good.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.479
What, uh, what is that?

14:15.605 --> 14:18.607
Uh, it's salsa. Sort of.

14:18.733 --> 14:22.194
Uh, usually you cut the tomatoes
into more than three chunks.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.531
But, hey, you know what?
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.658
Yeah, we'll see.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.660
Is there any, um,
chili powder around?

14:29.786 --> 14:32.246
Uh, yeah, in the cabinet behind you.
But, uh, go easy on it.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.915
Some of the guys have
sensitive stomachs. Chief Boden.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.625
Got it. Thank you.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.548
I smell Mexican food.

14:44.092 --> 14:47.052
What... Where... My couch?

14:47.679 --> 14:50.180
Our couch! Where's our couch?

14:50.306 --> 14:52.933
You poked the
bear, Mouch.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.394
Hmm.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.360
She said Boden needs
a waiting area outside his office.

15:03.486 --> 15:06.572
So she appropriated
my couch?

15:06.698 --> 15:07.948
Our couch.

15:08.616 --> 15:12.995
This is a violation.
She's stepped way over the line here.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.454
Yeah.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.832
- You should say something.
- I'm going to.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.503
When?

15:22.755 --> 15:23.964
Chow time!

15:24.841 --> 15:27.801
After lunch. I'll do it after lunch.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.348
Guys, you don't need
to spare my feelings.

15:33.474 --> 15:37.311
- Well, it's, uh... It's not bad.
- No, it's not bad at all.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.479
But it's not good.
I don't know what to tell you.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.524
I was always a tomboy growing up.
I barely knew where the kitchen was.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.942
I told you, I can still be the cook.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.194
Cruz, you drive truck.
It's an important job.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.155
- I can do both.
- Not necessary.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.074
Jones graduated at the top
of her academy class.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.244
I'm sure she can figure out
a little basic home ec.

15:56.414 --> 15:59.583
Am I going to be judged for my efforts
on the job or behind the stove?

16:02.045 --> 16:04.296
It's all part of the job, Jones.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.301
OK.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.722
Jones, when you're finished up in here,
the showers need cleaning.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.932
No, they don't.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.185
Excuse me?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.271
No, they don't, sir?

16:23.024 --> 16:26.943
Um, what I meant was, Herrmann already
asked me to scrub the showers.

16:27.570 --> 16:31.531
I'm asking you to scrub them again,
Candidate.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.635
Lieutenant, I think I have
a little problem here.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.971
I didn't know that Gabby Dawson
was dating Lieutenant Casey.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.015
- Jones.
- Nothing against her,

16:57.141 --> 17:00.852
but for whatever reason, she's got it in
for me, and now he's riding my ass.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.480
I know that you and I haven't
always seen eye to eye, but...

17:03.606 --> 17:05.148
- Jones...
- I shouldn't go outside

17:05.274 --> 17:06.733
the chain of command, but...

17:06.859 --> 17:08.777
I really don't have a chance here.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.029
Could you maybe talk to
Lieutenant Casey?

17:13.282 --> 17:15.742
Jones. You're at the squad table.

17:25.128 --> 17:28.213
Hey, Severide. Your dad's here.

17:32.385 --> 17:36.138
I need to know exactly
what these guys did to her.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.974
It was bad.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.310
So that's it? This Vince Keeler scumbag
just gets away with it?

17:42.437 --> 17:45.564
- No! He's not gonna get away with it.
- But if CPD's afraid to move on him...

17:45.690 --> 17:48.024
No, I'm not gonna let them
wash their hands of this.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.694
There's a detective in Hank Voight's
unit that's been helping.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.904
One way or another, trust me,
he's gonna pay.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.990
- I can make some calls.
- I got it, Pop.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.033
- Go back to Kenosha.
- I wanna help.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.410
I... I don't want your help.

17:58.536 --> 18:01.037
I could have used it a week ago,
when Katie went missing.

18:01.164 --> 18:04.499
But you know, you mosey on down here,
a day late and a dollar short, as usual.

18:04.625 --> 18:09.421
Her mother asked me to stay away!
I had to respect that. OK?

18:10.673 --> 18:12.674
Now it's been a few days
and I want to see Katie.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.801
Katie's gone.

18:15.845 --> 18:19.681
- What do you mean, gone?
- She left town. She needed to get away.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.152
Look.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.782
There's nothing more to do here, Pop.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.578
Just...

18:43.039 --> 18:44.664
Go back to Kenosha.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.018
She gave me this
the last time I was with her.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.103
St. Christopher's medal.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.815
To keep me safe on the drive down
to see her.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.029
After all I've done...

19:17.448 --> 19:19.741
...she's the one looking after me.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.123
Truck 81, Ambulance 61.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.460
Person stabbed.
California and West 26th.

19:42.306 --> 19:46.101
Sounds like we're here for crowd
control, so all hands on deck.

19:46.227 --> 19:49.062
Protect the medics.
Jones, where you gonna be?

19:49.188 --> 19:52.899
- Glued to your hip, Lieutenant.
- That's right. Let's go.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.955
Crowd control. Great.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.917
This way! Courtroom number four.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.757
We're in the middle of a murder trial,

20:17.884 --> 20:21.011
victim's father snuck a knife through
security and stabbed the defendant.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.637
He's bleeding out.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.514
I told you! Cut me loose!

20:24.640 --> 20:27.225
Cruz? Let's get a hold of him.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.773
Alright, his lung's hit.
Could develop into a pneumothorax.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.693
Get me an occlusive dressing.
We gotta get him out of here, now!

20:40.907 --> 20:42.574
- Oh, man.
- What?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.367
The key, it broke off in the lock.

20:51.292 --> 20:54.169
There are cops all over the place,
somebody's got to have a key.

20:54.295 --> 20:57.005
These are maximum security cuffs.
The standard key won't fit.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.299
I'll call over to the jail.
They'll have a key.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.800
No time. He's losing too much blood.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.803
Otis, get the bolt cutters
from the truck. Hurry.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.680
Shay, get me an IV and oxygen.

21:05.806 --> 21:09.309
Herrmann, give me the Halligan.
Mouch, hold him.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.525
- Guys, we're losing him.
- If he dies on our watch...

21:21.781 --> 21:26.326
Herrmann, Jones, search the halls
for a CO2 extinguisher. Fast as you can.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.957
- I'll go this way, you go that way.
- Yeah, aye-aye.

21:32.750 --> 21:36.336
Hey, look out! Look out! Excuse me!

21:43.052 --> 21:47.222
Hey! Look out! Look out!
Excuse me! Excuse me!

21:58.484 --> 21:59.609
Hit the eye bolt.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.370
That's enough.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.169
OK, let's do it!

22:18.963 --> 22:20.964
On three. One, two, three!

22:21.090 --> 22:23.466
Make a hole! Coming through.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.053
Yeah, Otis, we don't need 'em anymore.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.972
Oh. OK.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.652
Yes, you got there faster. Big deal.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.446
I didn't realize it was a race.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.698
You don't have
to make excuses, Herrmann.

22:46.824 --> 22:49.367
I have a long stride and I've been doing
a lot of training recently.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.578
There's really no reason
to get defensive about this.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.288
I'm not getting defensive!

22:53.414 --> 22:55.206
Good. I'm going around telling people

22:55.332 --> 22:58.293
- you got schooled by a chick.
- That wouldn't be cool.

22:58.419 --> 23:02.088
Yeah, you saved the life of a
homicidal maniac. Congratulations!

23:02.214 --> 23:04.340
Alleged homicidal maniac.

23:05.259 --> 23:07.677
Jones, can I have a word with you?

23:15.061 --> 23:17.395
Jones, I'm going to give
you some friendly advice.

23:17.521 --> 23:20.398
There's only two things you need to know
in order to succeed here.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.776
Do your job. Keep your mouth shut.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.986
I was just busting balls, Lieutenant.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.781
I'll repeat number two.
Keep your mouth shut.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.700
The guys bust balls all the time,
but a woman can't join in?

23:30.826 --> 23:33.787
- Not a woman candidate.
- I can't afford to be a wallflower...

23:33.913 --> 23:36.498
- I've been unfairly portrayed...
- You're still talking.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.750
- Lieutenant...
- Why are you still talking?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.381
Atta girl.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.184
You need to see the Chief?

23:56.310 --> 23:59.270
- Uh, well, I...
- Have a seat.

24:09.406 --> 24:13.576
She's barely on shift for ten minutes
before she breaks a $40 saw blade.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.078
Can't cook to save her life.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.330
So, I should tell her father
that she's doing great.

24:17.456 --> 24:21.042
Yeah.
Tell him she's the bee's knees.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.420
Thank you for the update, Casey.

24:27.925 --> 24:32.262
Oh, hey, I heard you and Donna
hit a bump in the road.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.018
Forget I brought it up.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.273
Except...

24:43.858 --> 24:46.276
You know, when I woke up
in the hospital,

24:46.402 --> 24:48.027
saw what a close call I had,

24:48.154 --> 24:51.156
I started to realize how
much of my life I'd wasted

24:51.282 --> 24:53.825
fretting over
all the stupid little stuff.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.162
You can't see beyond the horizon.

24:57.288 --> 25:00.748
You don't know how much road
you've still got lying ahead of you.

25:08.591 --> 25:12.260
- Sorry, Casey. Chief, you got a minute?
- What's up, Mouch?

25:13.637 --> 25:16.556
She is really off the
reservation this time.

25:16.682 --> 25:20.768
I mean, a waiting area?
You don't need a waiting area.

25:20.895 --> 25:23.188
- Unless it was your idea.
- I had nothing to do with it.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.315
Of course not. What are you, a dentist?

25:25.441 --> 25:27.192
No, you're a firefighter.

25:27.318 --> 25:31.446
Chief, you got to say something to her.
We need that couch back.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.239
The guys are really worked up over this.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.700
Mouch, my entire relationship
with Connie

25:35.826 --> 25:37.952
is based on asking her
for as little as possible.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.999
But... she's your assistant.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.751
Mm-hmm.

25:45.586 --> 25:46.878
Anything else?

25:49.757 --> 25:51.424
I guess not.

26:08.442 --> 26:11.069
- What's up?
- What's up?

26:11.195 --> 26:14.155
You've been quiet today.
Thinking dark thoughts?

26:14.281 --> 26:17.408
Nope. Puppies and unicorns.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.619
Hey, guys, he's not moving.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.747
Oh, yeah, there's some guy
half blocking the driveway.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.210
That's Vince Keeler's car.

26:27.336 --> 26:30.296
There's a cat stuck up in a tree. I
thought you might want to check it out.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.674
Hey, why don't you come out!

26:47.731 --> 26:49.190
I want in.

26:49.984 --> 26:51.067
What's up?

26:51.735 --> 26:53.027
I love that girl, Kelly.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.612
You took her out for a milkshake...

26:54.738 --> 26:55.822
Don't!

26:55.948 --> 26:57.907
She's a sweet and beautiful person,

26:58.033 --> 27:01.202
and that son of a bitch
took something from her.

27:01.328 --> 27:04.038
So, whatever your plan is, I'm in.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.082
Leave it alone, Otis. There is no plan.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.918
So let's make one.
Cos he's walking around free,

27:09.044 --> 27:12.422
and he's rubbing our faces in it,
so I'll be damned...

27:14.550 --> 27:17.343
- Kelly.
- Hey. What's up?

27:17.469 --> 27:19.512
I just wanted to bring you an update.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.015
- Did you get Keeler?
- Sorry, no big news yet.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.309
But I told you we wouldn't give up,
and we haven't.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.311
Voight's been softening up
the Bureau Chief,

27:26.437 --> 27:29.272
and I'm figuring out who the hook is
that Keeler has in the department.

27:29.398 --> 27:32.525
OK, well, let me know
if anything changes.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.360
I appreciate you stopping by.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.782
Hey, Kelly. Do I need
to put a tail on you?

27:43.871 --> 27:45.538
Get something straight.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.832
I will haul your ass in
and lock you in the drunk tank

27:47.958 --> 27:50.626
if I catch even a whiff of revenge.

27:50.753 --> 27:54.922
Erin, I don't know what you think
I'm gonna do, or doing.

27:55.049 --> 27:57.967
I get it. But as bad as things are
for your sister right now,

27:58.093 --> 27:59.469
you think they're gonna get better

27:59.595 --> 28:03.181
if her brother gets brought up
on assault? Or worse?

28:11.732 --> 28:13.232
OK.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.703
Can I help you guys?

28:27.206 --> 28:28.539
It's about Jones.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.209
- What about her?
- She ain't a good fit, Casey.

28:31.335 --> 28:33.753
- She's cocky.
- And entitled.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.047
A foxy gal, I'll grant you that.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.758
She breaks balls
with her superiors,

28:38.884 --> 28:41.177
and she thinks she's untouchable
because of who her dad is.

28:41.303 --> 28:44.138
We want to let you know if you decide
to do something, we got your back.

28:44.264 --> 28:48.059
Her dad tries to pull rank, we'll bring
the full force of the union to bear.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.477
Guys...

28:50.687 --> 28:53.815
- It's her first day.
- Longest day of my career.

28:53.941 --> 28:58.444
She's a handful. But she's just trying
to hold her own in an old boys' club.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.613
Give her a chance.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.954
You guys holding a
book club meeting in there?

29:08.080 --> 29:10.706
The boys are a little resentful
of Jones.

29:10.833 --> 29:14.085
But I told them they need
to give her a fair shake.

29:14.211 --> 29:15.336
Why?

29:15.462 --> 29:18.464
Because, if she were a man,

29:18.590 --> 29:20.758
they probably wouldn't be
throwing around words like

29:20.884 --> 29:23.511
"cocky" and "entitled"
half a day into his first shift.

29:24.471 --> 29:27.181
And in this little hypothetical,
does the man also cheat

29:27.307 --> 29:29.392
his way through the academy?

29:30.727 --> 29:34.480
- I figured you'd be on my side here.
- Why? Because I'm a woman?

29:34.606 --> 29:38.234
Matt, the guys are right.
She is entitled and cocky.

29:39.153 --> 29:41.696
I thought you didn't harbor
any resentment toward her.

29:41.822 --> 29:44.282
I don't. I'm just saying
that the facts are the facts,

29:44.408 --> 29:47.952
and I assumed that you understood
what kind of recruit she was.

29:48.745 --> 29:53.124
Look, I wasn't gonna say anything,
but she came at me this morning.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.419
She thinks I ratted her out to you.
Which, granted, I sort of did.

29:56.545 --> 29:59.005
But I didn't know that
you were gonna be her Lieutenant...

29:59.131 --> 30:02.133
What do you mean,
she came at you? She threatened you?

30:02.259 --> 30:04.886
Don't worry about it,
I can handle myself, OK?

30:05.012 --> 30:07.847
The important thing is that
you make sure she gets a fair shake.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.057
Gabby, take a deep breath.

30:10.767 --> 30:14.312
- Don't condescend to me...
- Why are you taking this out on me?

30:14.438 --> 30:17.356
I'm just trying to make the best
of a situation that I didn't create.

30:17.483 --> 30:20.109
I didn't request Jones for Truck 81.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.986
I certainly don't want
the responsibility

30:22.112 --> 30:23.446
of sending a woman into harm's way.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.324
- Oh, so she can't take care of herself?
- Now you're defending her!

30:26.450 --> 30:28.951
What about me? Would you worry about me
if I were on truck?

30:29.077 --> 30:33.998
I worry about you every time
you get on that ambulance, alright?

30:34.124 --> 30:36.584
So, yeah. A truck was
going to be that times ten.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.503
So, you're relieved
I didn't make the cut.

30:38.629 --> 30:41.797
- Gabby...
- You don't want me to be a firefighter.

30:42.716 --> 30:45.718
You know what? I give up. Whatever I
say, you're gonna take it the wrong way.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.929
Fine, then don't say anything.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.691
I tried to get flowers, but...

31:01.902 --> 31:04.904
Anyway, I owe you an apology.

31:06.073 --> 31:10.701
You have your hands full taking care
of Chief Boden and this firehouse,

31:10.827 --> 31:13.913
and I piled even more on your plate.

31:18.335 --> 31:20.336
Truth is, Connie...

31:21.713 --> 31:24.507
I think I bit off more than I can chew
with this union gig.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.842
I am drowning in it.

31:26.969 --> 31:30.763
Most guys don't try and stay on the job
when they take office.

31:32.099 --> 31:35.935
God, I don't know what I was thinking.
Things were going just fine for me.

31:36.061 --> 31:38.437
Why did I have to ruin my life?

31:43.527 --> 31:46.070
Man up, honey. You're a firefighter.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.116
Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3,

31:50.242 --> 31:53.327
Ambulance 61, High-rise fire.
Michigan and Huron.

32:01.128 --> 32:04.463
So, they've rolled out Squad right away.
Does that mean this is a working fire?

32:04.590 --> 32:09.760
Don't know yet, but any call in a
high-rise, we have to take seriously.

32:09.886 --> 32:13.514
If it is a fire, and it gets out of
hand... that's bad.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.185
I guess because I'm a woman

32:18.312 --> 32:20.605
I couldn't possibly be objective
about a female candidate.

32:20.731 --> 32:22.857
I'm just supposed to say,
"You go, girl,"

32:22.983 --> 32:25.693
even though I know for a fact
that she's a cocky, entitled, cheater.

32:25.819 --> 32:28.529
- Did she seriously threaten you?
- Damn right she did.

32:28.655 --> 32:32.033
OK, sweetheart, tonight you and I are
gonna unscrew the legs on her bunk.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.535
See? You understand me.

32:55.182 --> 32:57.099
Wow. This is a real party.

33:05.192 --> 33:07.777
People are reporting smoke on 18.
That's a law firm.

33:07.903 --> 33:10.738
- Anyone working late?
- I don't know, but I got bad news.

33:10.864 --> 33:13.699
Elevator's been acting up.
I'll put in a work order on Monday.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.619
Otis, recall these elevators.
Lock them off. We're taking the stairs.

33:16.745 --> 33:20.331
North stairwell, fire attack.
South, evacuation.

33:20.457 --> 33:23.709
Engine 51, Truck 81, and Squad,
fire attack and search on 18.

33:23.835 --> 33:28.089
Engine 67, lobby control.
Truck 63, rapid ascent...

33:28.215 --> 33:30.424
Jones, get a spare bottle for yourself.

33:30.550 --> 33:31.842
I'm coming up?

33:31.968 --> 33:34.679
You and I are gonna help Engine.
Grab a high-rise pack.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.397
You want to be a firefighter.

34:24.354 --> 34:25.980
Come on, buddy, let's go.

34:32.362 --> 34:34.947
Jones! Hose pack and air bottles.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.304
Jones, mask up.

34:59.473 --> 35:02.433
Come on! Move it! Come on!

35:16.448 --> 35:17.865
Ready?

35:32.422 --> 35:34.673
You're going to be fine, Jones.
Stick with me.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.842
Go where I go. OK?

35:36.968 --> 35:40.679
Mills! You take the left.
Casey, you go right. I'll go deep.

35:44.059 --> 35:46.310
Herrmann, with Severide!

35:57.280 --> 35:59.323
Fire department, call out!

36:04.830 --> 36:08.123
Jones! Get him out of here.
I'll find the others.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.834
OK!

36:57.465 --> 37:00.426
Hey, I got it!
I'll get it. I'll get it from here!

37:02.554 --> 37:05.222
What do we do?
Do we get him oxygen?

37:06.516 --> 37:10.519
Yeah, he don't look too good.
We're gonna need to get him out of here.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.608
Hey, hey, hey! Look at me!

37:15.734 --> 37:18.861
You're doing great, alright?
You're fine!

37:19.571 --> 37:21.572
Keep doing it!

37:27.537 --> 37:30.831
Get back with Lieutenant! Go!

37:33.585 --> 37:36.629
Stay low!
Jones, give me a hand!

37:52.020 --> 37:53.520
Here, I got her.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.870
You're alright.
You're alright. Alright.

38:18.797 --> 38:22.091
- Hey, is the Bulls game still on?
- I think so.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.718
You like
basketball, Jones?

38:24.844 --> 38:27.805
That's the one with
the little orange bouncy ball.

38:48.326 --> 38:52.621
And just like that,
all is right with the world.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.709
Ah!

39:03.466 --> 39:09.388
Happy? If I go back to my desk, are you
gonna run and tell your father on me?

39:12.392 --> 39:13.934
Jones.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.688
Nothing like a little
baptism by fire, huh?

39:18.690 --> 39:20.733
You acquitted yourself
very nicely back there.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.192
Thank you, sir.

39:22.318 --> 39:25.154
You looked like the kind of firefighter
we want here at 51.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.741
Of course, you, uh, need
to perform in the kitchen.

39:28.867 --> 39:33.287
So I asked Mills to compile
some of his easier recipes.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.831
OK. Thanks.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.375
Hopefully his handwriting
isn't too sloppy.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.253
I understand you have dyslexia.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.804
You're gonna do just fine.

39:50.930 --> 39:54.850
Yeah. Somehow I think it's gonna take
more than jalapeño poppers.

39:57.896 --> 40:01.774
OK. How about a two-bedroom
in Wicker Park?

40:01.900 --> 40:05.444
New kitchen, Whirlpool tub,
two parking spaces.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.451
Ah. Not bad. See if we can look at it.

40:13.495 --> 40:14.745
Hey.

40:16.623 --> 40:18.415
Are we good?

40:18.541 --> 40:21.627
Yeah. We're good.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.148
punched in the face.
It just got to be...

40:44.359 --> 40:45.984
Erin...

40:46.945 --> 40:48.529
Gentlemen.

40:50.573 --> 40:54.118
Vince Keeler's car was found
outside his gym, keys in the ignition.

40:54.244 --> 40:57.121
Cell phone was dumped
in a nearby storm sewer.

40:57.247 --> 41:00.165
Nobody's heard from
Keeler since last night.

41:03.545 --> 41:05.629
Seems he's gone missing.
