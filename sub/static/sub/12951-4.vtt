00:03.069 --> 00:05.537
<i>CIA profile:
Agent Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:05.538 --> 00:06.438
Okay. I'm in.

00:06.439 --> 00:09.374
<i>Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow.</i>

00:09.442 --> 00:11.243
<i>Also a double agent with CIA.</i>

00:11.244 --> 00:12.678
Get down!

00:12.679 --> 00:14.813
I guess we'll have to learn
to trust each other.

00:14.814 --> 00:17.314
<i>Bristow's CIA contact:
Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:17.350 --> 00:19.151
My guardian angel.

00:19.152 --> 00:23.748
<i>Her current assignment:
To infiltrate and destroy SD-6.</i>

00:23.823 --> 00:26.621
<i>A secret organization
dealing in espionage,</i>

00:26.693 --> 00:29.719
<i>extortion, weapons sales,
posing as the CIA.</i>

00:29.796 --> 00:32.662
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.666
<i>SD-6 director: Arvin Sloane.</i>

00:34.667 --> 00:37.397
The sanctity of this agency
requires the sacrifice

00:37.470 --> 00:38.904
of some personal freedoms.

00:38.905 --> 00:41.405
This is not about cutting off
an arm of the monster.

00:41.474 --> 00:43.308
This is about killing
the monster.

00:43.309 --> 00:46.540
<i>Bristow's mother,
formerly Russian intelligence,</i>

00:46.613 --> 00:49.207
<i>recently turned herself in
to the CIA.</i>

00:49.282 --> 00:50.983
Mom?

00:50.984 --> 00:52.384
<i>Intel indicates</i>

00:52.385 --> 00:55.218
<i>she may still be
an enemy of the United States.</i>

00:56.423 --> 00:59.256
<i>The true loyalty
of Agent Bristow's mother</i>

00:59.325 --> 01:01.326
<i>remains unknown.</i>

01:01.327 --> 01:03.128
<i>Previously on "Alias"...</i>

01:03.129 --> 01:06.792
I want help to persuade Sydney
not to interact with her mother.

01:06.866 --> 01:07.866
Why?

01:07.867 --> 01:11.325
Irina Derevko
is an opportunistic sociopath

01:11.404 --> 01:13.904
who will use whatever inroads
she can make with my daughter

01:13.973 --> 01:15.307
to get what she wants.

01:15.308 --> 01:18.937
I'm sorry,
but I am not in the habit

01:19.012 --> 01:21.480
of helping a father
manipulate his daughter.

01:21.481 --> 01:24.041
No matter how good
his intentions may be.

01:24.117 --> 01:27.143
Sark is looking for a music box
designed by Rambaldi.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.321
The box plays a unique tune.

01:29.322 --> 01:31.523
Encoded within the tune,
there's an equation.

01:31.524 --> 01:32.724
For what?

01:32.725 --> 01:35.225
Zero-point energy.

01:35.995 --> 01:37.262
Watch your step.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.730
If you fall through the ice,

01:38.731 --> 01:40.532
it'll freeze over
in four seconds.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.406
Cooper! Reading four!

01:47.407 --> 01:50.808
Four tango! They're heading
for the entrance!

01:52.245 --> 01:55.237
Novak!
They're under the ice!

01:57.750 --> 01:59.585
Sydney, do you copy?!

01:59.586 --> 02:01.086
I read you.
What's wrong?

02:01.087 --> 02:03.817
Get out of there!
Sark's here!

02:06.759 --> 02:09.258
Aah!

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.903 --> 03:59.204
Sydney.

03:59.205 --> 04:01.705
Hi.

04:07.213 --> 04:09.943
The music box that you
were sent to retrieve.

04:10.016 --> 04:11.650
Mr. Sark got away with it.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.019
Yes.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.954
But after 500 years
buried in the Siberian ice,

04:17.023 --> 04:18.923
the music box was corroded.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.519
It practically fell apart
in my hands.

04:23.529 --> 04:26.029
That's odd.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.199
What's that?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.667
Milo Rambaldi.

04:28.668 --> 04:32.695
He's done this before.
Many times.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.272
Hiding information
inside works of art.

04:35.341 --> 04:38.037
The clock, sculpture.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.544
Hmm?

04:39.545 --> 04:42.776
This time, he chose to bury one
of his important innovations,

04:42.849 --> 04:46.216
the formula
for zero-point energy,

04:46.286 --> 04:47.853
inside a music box.

04:47.854 --> 04:52.120
You're talking about an inventor
who lived 500 years ago.

04:52.191 --> 04:56.150
Anything regarding Milo Rambaldi
seems odd to me.

04:56.229 --> 05:00.131
Well, what's unusual isn't how
he hid the information, Sydney.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.633
It's where.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.694
Why would Milo Rambaldi
go to the unimaginable length

05:04.771 --> 05:08.070
of having catacombs
built in Siberia...

05:09.242 --> 05:13.201
...only to leave his music box
exposed to corrosive elements?

05:19.585 --> 05:22.247
Another Rambaldi mystery.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.658
So, do you think
Sloane suspects you?

05:26.659 --> 05:29.027
That I used the inhaler
to corrode the music box?

05:29.028 --> 05:31.229
I don't think so.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.565
Sloane made sure I knew
how relieved he was

05:33.566 --> 05:36.296
that I made it back safely.

05:36.369 --> 05:39.167
I went home, took a shower,
and came here.

05:39.238 --> 05:40.972
Good.

05:40.973 --> 05:44.670
By the way, you should know
Siberia was a complete success.

05:44.744 --> 05:47.079
When you activated
the music box, we recorded it.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.780
It's at Langley for analysis.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.849
So we got the intel
and Sloane didn't.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.350
Neither did Sark.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.689
What?

06:00.827 --> 06:03.728
The information my mother
gave us helped us again.

06:03.796 --> 06:05.397
That's all.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.232
You can talk
to me about your mother.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.733
Doing that is harder
for you than you make it seem.

06:09.802 --> 06:10.802
It's my job.

06:10.803 --> 06:13.271
- Vaughn, she killed your father.
- Yes, thank you.

06:13.272 --> 06:16.332
- You don't have to pretend.
- You don't have to withhold.

06:16.409 --> 06:17.843
It's unfair.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.870
I certainly didn't join the CIA
looking for fairness.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.815
After everything
she's done to you,

06:23.816 --> 06:26.316
are those things
you could ever forgive?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.588
I don't know.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.456
Your father
doesn't share that ambiguity.

06:31.457 --> 06:34.221
He's meeting with Assistant
Director Kendall now,

06:34.293 --> 06:36.793
and he is lobbying to have
your mother taken away.

06:42.535 --> 06:45.035
As long as she's helping us
in the war against SD-6

06:45.037 --> 06:46.838
and The Alliance, she stays.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.273
Did you even read my report?

06:48.274 --> 06:49.274
Yes, of course.

06:49.275 --> 06:51.476
Well, why are you
disregarding what I wrote?

06:51.477 --> 06:53.678
Great job in Siberia,
Agent Bristow.

06:53.679 --> 06:56.179
Excuse me.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.807
I agree with what you wrote,
that on more than one occasion,

06:59.886 --> 07:03.253
your mother has provided
crucial intelligence to the CIA

07:03.322 --> 07:05.524
to the detriment of SD-6.

07:05.525 --> 07:08.722
It would appear that her actions
have kept you out of harm's way.

07:08.795 --> 07:12.253
- That's a fact.
- There's another fact.

07:12.331 --> 07:16.392
Nothing that woman says or does
can be taken at face value.

07:16.469 --> 07:18.637
Her motivations
are strictly her own.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.539
Now that your dealings
with your mother

07:20.540 --> 07:24.772
have taken on
an emotional component...

07:24.844 --> 07:26.044
I'm concerned.

07:26.045 --> 07:27.212
Well, don't be.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.648
I'm more professional than that.

07:29.649 --> 07:32.846
Every one of our discussions
has been mission-related.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.986
You told her
about your school play.

07:34.987 --> 07:37.389
You heard me tell her
I was a turkey?

07:37.390 --> 07:39.890
Yes.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.294
You were watching me.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.766
Dad, I have enough spying
in my life.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.334
What I've been watching is you

07:49.335 --> 07:52.236
making the same mistakes
with that woman that I did.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.433
<i>She's someone you've idealized
for almost 20 years.</i>

07:55.508 --> 07:58.008
You didn't learn about
her history until recently.

07:58.044 --> 07:59.377
What does that matter?

07:59.378 --> 08:02.541
That you've wanted a mother...

08:02.615 --> 08:04.516
your mother...

08:04.517 --> 08:07.145
all your life.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.753
And now here she is.

08:08.754 --> 08:11.254
Dad...

08:12.859 --> 08:15.359
You don't have to worry
about me.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.297
I'm not that naive.

08:19.298 --> 08:23.394
I'm sure that's something
we both hope is true.

09:08.614 --> 09:11.114
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.487
Several nights ago,

09:15.488 --> 09:17.756
I received a phone call
at my home.

09:17.757 --> 09:19.524
There was no one
at the other end.

09:19.525 --> 09:23.017
Just some high-pitched static.

09:23.095 --> 09:26.929
But something about the call
left me unsettled.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.767
Did Security Section
run a trace?

09:28.768 --> 09:30.235
Yeah.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.864
The call originated
in Sonoma, California.

09:32.939 --> 09:35.840
<i>The Barranca
Bed & Breakfast Inn.</i>

09:35.908 --> 09:38.143
Emily and I
spent some time there.

09:38.144 --> 09:41.841
It was...

09:41.914 --> 09:44.316
It was our favorite getaway.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.817
Simple.
It was a wrong number.

09:48.554 --> 09:50.221
I'm not so sure.

09:50.222 --> 09:52.457
I don't understand
what you're suggesting.

09:52.458 --> 09:56.451
I'm suggesting that someone may
be trying to leave me unsettled.

09:58.364 --> 10:01.492
I would like you to send
someone to Sonoma, Jack.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.635
I need to know
who made that call.

10:03.636 --> 10:05.937
Sure. I'll get
Security Section.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.907
Jack, I don't want this to get
back to The Alliance.

10:08.975 --> 10:11.569
They can't know
that I'm taking measures.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.112
- I understand.
- Good.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.613
I'll send Dixon.

10:17.416 --> 10:20.249
Jack, there's something else.

10:20.319 --> 10:24.312
After Sark recovered
Rambaldi's music box,

10:24.390 --> 10:27.188
we tracked him to a safe house
in the Falkland Islands.

10:27.259 --> 10:29.260
Sent in a team.

10:29.261 --> 10:32.094
And did we retrieve it?

10:32.164 --> 10:33.765
Yes.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.735
It was destroyed with age,
as Sydney said.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.837
Worthless.

10:38.838 --> 10:41.338
But we found something else.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.744
He was not 80 years old.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.045
At least.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.980
Syd, I'm serious.

10:48.981 --> 10:52.041
I expect a delivery guy
to be totally buffed out.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.885
He sounded hot on the phone.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.387
Was he a cute 80?

10:55.388 --> 10:56.588
Shut up.

10:56.589 --> 10:59.251
There's a woman on the phone
from the Health Department.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.825
I'm getting graded today.

11:08.367 --> 11:10.867
How's it going?

11:10.936 --> 11:13.436
Okay.

11:14.807 --> 11:17.142
How's your mom?

11:17.143 --> 11:19.643
Oh...

11:21.247 --> 11:23.114
How are you?

11:23.115 --> 11:26.607
I got four weeks of community
service, and then I'm done.

11:28.788 --> 11:31.416
Hey, you remember last week

11:31.490 --> 11:33.858
when I cooperated
and let the CIA hypnotize me?

11:33.859 --> 11:34.893
Yeah.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.261
What happened with that?

11:36.262 --> 11:38.563
Was I helpful at all?

11:38.564 --> 11:41.192
I'm only asking because
about five minutes ago,

11:41.267 --> 11:43.134
I was doing well as a reporter,

11:43.135 --> 11:46.229
and now I'm just a dishwasher
living in denial.

11:46.305 --> 11:48.805
That's all.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.176
The information
you provided was huge.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.911
Huge?

11:52.912 --> 11:53.945
Really?

11:53.946 --> 11:57.780
Because of you,
the CIA scored a real victory.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.818
I should have told you before.
I'm sorry.

11:59.819 --> 12:02.319
No. Don't worry about it.
That's so good to know.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.560
Good guys or bad guys?

12:08.561 --> 12:11.894
Neither. My father.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.003
Everything okay?

12:19.004 --> 12:21.802
I talked with Sloane.
He sent a team after Sark.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.638
- He wanted the music box.
- I told him it was ruined.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.344
But he wanted it anyway.

12:26.345 --> 12:29.712
He tracked down Sark
to a location in the Falklands.

12:35.454 --> 12:38.252
Sark fought back.
He got away.

12:39.992 --> 12:43.086
They did, however,
find a man at that location

12:43.162 --> 12:45.926
who was being held, tortured.

12:45.998 --> 12:48.831
His name is Claus Richter.

12:48.901 --> 12:51.169
Three weeks ago,
Richter was in Barcelona.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.471
- When I was there.
- Along with your mother.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.840
The operations manual
of the organization

12:55.841 --> 12:57.575
your mother used to run,
the bible.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.410
Anyone who gets
their hands on that book

12:59.411 --> 13:01.813
will gain access to all
the contacts, technology,

13:01.814 --> 13:03.915
and weaponry they amassed.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.646
Sloane believes your mother
gave the manual to Richter.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.987
That he was the man
who hid the book.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.922
- Do you think that's true?
- It is.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.423
They brought Richter
into an SD-6 holding cell,

13:13.425 --> 13:15.925
and I interrogated him.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.989
Before being brought into SD-6,

13:19.064 --> 13:21.533
Richter was screened
for every possible infection.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.034
Ebola, HIV, retroviruses.

13:24.069 --> 13:27.436
They didn't find a thing,
yet this man was clearly dying.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.908
Medtech believes
he may have been suffering

13:29.909 --> 13:33.310
from an allergic reaction
to something Sark used on him.

13:34.046 --> 13:36.181
Apparently,
the first sign was bleeding

13:36.182 --> 13:38.016
from the fingernails.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.951
Sloane wanted me to torture him,

13:39.952 --> 13:42.387
but that man
was tortured as it was.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.888
So I gave him morphine.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.238
Irina Derevko gave you
the operations manual

14:00.239 --> 14:02.340
for her syndicate.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.401
I would like you to tell me
where you've hidden it.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.316
Derevko is a great woman.

14:11.383 --> 14:13.883
Morphine's not bad, either.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.087
Let me be clear.

14:16.088 --> 14:18.489
I've given you enough
to last five minutes.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.525
Cooperate, and get all you want.

14:20.526 --> 14:24.053
Resist, and you get none.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.824
Where did you hide that manual?

14:32.104 --> 14:34.766
The location
was too remote to describe.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.175
It turns out Richter
had designed a map

14:37.176 --> 14:39.577
to lead your mother back
to the book's location.

14:39.578 --> 14:40.578
Where's the map?

14:40.579 --> 14:42.914
Inside a first edition
of "War and Peace"

14:42.915 --> 14:44.682
at the technical services
library

14:44.683 --> 14:46.684
at FAPSI headquarters in Moscow.

14:46.685 --> 14:48.086
FAPSI headquarters.

14:48.087 --> 14:50.455
Sloane is preparing
to send you to Moscow

14:50.456 --> 14:52.190
to retrieve Richter's map.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.525
I've had the CIA
fabricate a bogus map.

14:54.526 --> 14:57.757
Go to Moscow, retrieve the real
one, which you'll return to CIA.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.864
Give SD-6 this map,
which will lead them

14:59.865 --> 15:02.333
to the middle
of the Sunken Forest.

15:02.334 --> 15:06.293
Why have you come to me
before my SD-6 briefing,

15:06.372 --> 15:08.706
giving me the countermission
instead of Vaughn?

15:08.707 --> 15:11.699
This is the best way to respond
to your responsibility.

15:11.777 --> 15:14.012
You don't want me
to take this to Mom.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.747
There's no benefit
in seeing her.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.815
- You have all you need.
- We don't know that.

15:17.816 --> 15:20.410
We've been doing this enough
to know our system works.

15:20.486 --> 15:23.046
Our system was stagnant
until Mom turned herself in.

15:23.122 --> 15:24.122
We've covered this.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.357
We have both been betrayed
by this woman.

15:26.358 --> 15:29.384
The difference is
I am willing to squeeze her

15:29.461 --> 15:32.157
for everything she's got
to take down the enemy,

15:32.231 --> 15:35.962
anything to get me out of
this life as soon as possible.

15:36.035 --> 15:38.535
Anything.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.372
I'm Will, and I'm an addict.

15:41.373 --> 15:43.873
Hi, Will.

15:44.443 --> 15:48.311
I never thought about
my reputation until I lost it.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.248
It all happened very publicly.

15:50.249 --> 15:55.414
People actually look at me
at the market and stuff.

15:55.487 --> 15:59.218
"Oh, hey, there's the drug
addict from the newspaper. "

16:04.229 --> 16:10.361
Actually, there has been one
happy by-product from all this.

16:10.436 --> 16:15.339
I have a good friend
who, it turns out, I...

16:15.407 --> 16:18.501
I didn't know at all before.

16:18.577 --> 16:20.278
And now she and I can talk

16:20.279 --> 16:22.747
in a way
that we never did before.

16:22.748 --> 16:25.248
And, uh...

16:27.186 --> 16:30.246
And I don't think I would
trade that for anything.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.535
The same thing happened to me.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.437
What?

16:46.438 --> 16:49.202
I learned
who my true friends were

16:49.274 --> 16:53.074
when everyone found out
about my habit.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.807
Uh, Rebecca Martinez.

16:55.881 --> 16:57.148
Hi. I'm Will Tippin.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.947
I know who you are.
I read your articles.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.453
The reporter
with the big imagination

17:02.454 --> 17:05.719
who fell in love with
the heroin-chic lifestyle.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.825
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.326
My theory?

17:10.561 --> 17:13.792
I don't think you ever
really were a drug addict.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.599
Why would you say that?

17:15.601 --> 17:19.263
I believe what you wrote
about SD-6 was true.

17:19.338 --> 17:22.704
You got too close to some kind
of secret conspiracy,

17:22.775 --> 17:24.342
and they had to shut you down.

17:24.343 --> 17:27.779
They probably came after you,
told you not to talk.

17:27.846 --> 17:31.543
They couldn't kill you.
That would expose them.

17:31.617 --> 17:35.348
So they threatened you, and to
ruin your rep, they shot you up.

17:35.421 --> 17:36.587
No.

17:36.588 --> 17:39.088
I made up all that stuff
about SD-6.

17:39.158 --> 17:43.117
That was me.
That was me being an idiot.

17:44.763 --> 17:45.863
What?

17:45.864 --> 17:48.266
Uh, no, sorry, I'm...

17:48.267 --> 17:50.268
I'm sort of
a conspiracy theorist.

17:50.269 --> 17:54.205
I have a web page.
Conspiracychick.com.

17:55.607 --> 17:59.304
I want to prove your story
about SD-6 was real.

18:25.704 --> 18:29.037
Claus Richter
is in SD-6 custody.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.677
I'm aware that
you refuse to give the CIA

18:32.678 --> 18:34.912
details about
this operations manual

18:34.913 --> 18:37.507
you had Richter hide away.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.484
And I understand why.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.352
The knowledge contained
in that manual

18:42.421 --> 18:45.549
is your only leverage.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.184
But now,
having spoken with Richter,

18:48.260 --> 18:51.024
SD-6 is after it.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.465
Richter was found
in the custody of Mr. Sark.

18:56.535 --> 18:58.536
We don't know what Sark knows.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.529
He might already have
the map in his possession.

19:03.075 --> 19:06.841
I'm here because SD-6
is sending me to Moscow.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.710
I'm going to retrieve the map
at FAPSI headquarters.

19:09.781 --> 19:14.411
If you want to help
the CIA, as you claim to,

19:14.486 --> 19:16.721
you'll give us
any information you have

19:16.722 --> 19:20.021
that will facilitate
the recovery of Richter's map.

19:25.964 --> 19:29.957
When I turned myself over
to CIA,

19:30.035 --> 19:33.061
a pair of earrings
were taken from me.

19:36.508 --> 19:40.239
They have sentimental value.
I'd like them back.

19:42.047 --> 19:44.547
I'll see what I can do.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.053
And in good faith,

19:49.054 --> 19:52.046
tell me how you plan on
breaking into the library.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.624
She went to see her mother.

19:55.894 --> 19:58.229
I tried.
I tried to stop her.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.263
I made it clear.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.232
Made what clear?

20:01.233 --> 20:05.363
Trusting her mother,
she's playing with fire.

20:05.437 --> 20:07.138
We've had this discussion.

20:07.139 --> 20:10.108
There is no one else
to do this job.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.868
Sydney went to see her mother.

20:13.946 --> 20:17.882
Yes, she's there now,
looking for help.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.951
The east-wing stairwell
is an option.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.750
I can see why SD-6 chose that,
but there is a better way

20:22.821 --> 20:25.056
to get
to the sixth-floor library.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.557
Write this down.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.691
Once you're inside,
don't take the main stairs.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.064
Look to your left...

20:33.065 --> 20:35.727
No one wants
a happy ending more than I do,

20:35.801 --> 20:38.702
but I know this woman.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.905
I know her charms.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.406
I know her tricks.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.976
The way she presents herself,
she disarms you.

20:47.045 --> 20:50.742
Some people have that talent.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.580
Compared to all of them,

20:53.652 --> 20:57.349
Irina Derevko is extraordinary.

20:57.422 --> 21:01.483
Is there any chance that
all she wants is forgiveness?

21:01.560 --> 21:04.060
No.

21:05.163 --> 21:08.132
Be specific about your concerns.

21:10.802 --> 21:14.169
I don't know what it is
Derevko wants.

21:14.239 --> 21:16.474
Maybe something within the CIA.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.676
Maybe to recruit Sydney
to her side.

21:18.677 --> 21:22.670
I can tell you I know this.

21:22.748 --> 21:25.649
Derevko is using
this agency and my daughter

21:25.717 --> 21:28.515
to get whatever it is
that she wants.

21:28.587 --> 21:31.522
Everywhere I look, people are
complacent and cooperative,

21:31.590 --> 21:34.090
listening to the...

21:35.861 --> 21:37.962
Listening to a woman

21:37.963 --> 21:41.694
who killed operatives
of the CIA,

21:41.767 --> 21:44.531
who destroyed countless lives.

21:44.603 --> 21:47.103
Yours?

21:53.478 --> 21:56.504
We'll take your suggestions
into consideration.

21:56.581 --> 21:59.081
Be careful.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.398
You asked me
what I was afraid of.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.836
I can tell you.
It's obvious.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.600
I'm afraid of losing
my daughter.

22:38.757 --> 22:40.257
Hey.

22:40.258 --> 22:42.818
So, I heard your father
came to see you

22:42.894 --> 22:44.762
and he tried to preempt
my involvement.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.755
He was just trying to keep me
away from my mother.

22:47.833 --> 22:50.333
I know.

22:50.902 --> 22:54.838
She had some intel for
this mission that could help.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.008
Good.

22:58.009 --> 23:00.807
Listen, as far
as your mother's concerned,

23:00.879 --> 23:02.847
it's ridiculous
for you to worry about me.

23:02.848 --> 23:04.048
I'm fine.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.484
What she did to my father,
I can handle.

23:06.485 --> 23:08.753
But when I heard
what your father did,

23:08.754 --> 23:11.188
coming to see you
like that, I...

23:11.189 --> 23:14.784
I realized how insane
this must be for him,

23:14.860 --> 23:17.852
having your mother
back in his life.

23:19.831 --> 23:23.096
Which only concerned me
because that means

23:23.168 --> 23:26.035
he's not making it
any easier for you.

23:27.839 --> 23:30.433
So, before you leave
for Moscow...

23:32.043 --> 23:33.377
I just wanted to say

23:33.378 --> 23:36.074
that you might feel
alone in all this,

23:36.148 --> 23:38.648
like you don't have an ally.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.754
I'm your ally.

23:45.290 --> 23:47.790
Never question that.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.924
Miss Bristow,
your plane's standing by.

23:57.669 --> 24:00.399
I'll see you when I get back.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.821
Okay, these medals you won.

25:33.899 --> 25:36.399
You didn't really win them,
and they're not medals.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.769
This one
is the Order of Bravery, right?

25:38.770 --> 25:40.905
Not a medal.
Right? No.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.973
It's an electronic skeleton key.

25:42.974 --> 25:45.474
It'll get you access
to the sixth floor.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.787
This one.
The Order of Zukov, first class.

25:56.788 --> 25:59.723
This will get you
into the technical library.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.534
This one is the Order of Merit.

26:10.535 --> 26:13.470
- It'll get you into the A.S.R.S.
- What's the A.S.R.S.?

26:13.538 --> 26:16.507
The books are in a secure area
underneath the building.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.510
To get them, you need to get to
the selection terminal.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.345
You'll type in the name
of the book.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.547
There's gonna be
this automatic crane thing

26:23.548 --> 26:25.182
that retrieves the book

26:25.183 --> 26:29.552
and then deposits it
over on the sixth floor, okay?

26:29.621 --> 26:31.889
Make sure you don't remove
the medal

26:31.890 --> 26:33.657
until after you've logged off,

26:33.658 --> 26:35.826
or you'll probably set off
the alarm.

26:35.827 --> 26:38.028
Ow!

26:38.029 --> 26:39.563
Actually, it felt kind of good.

26:54.045 --> 26:57.242
Whatever Arvin Sloane pays you,
it can't be enough.

26:58.583 --> 26:59.950
Would you work for me

26:59.951 --> 27:02.451
if it meant
I'd let you walk out of here?

27:03.321 --> 27:06.085
I believe if you took the time
to hear a offer,

27:06.157 --> 27:08.657
you might actually say yes.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.131
You're cute, but I'll pass.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.489
- Go ahead.
- It's me.

28:12.490 --> 28:15.618
I am trapped in the building.
I need a way out.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.928
My mother said something
about secret passages.

28:17.929 --> 28:20.429
Get her on the phone.

28:27.405 --> 28:31.102
Sydney's trapped in the FAPSI
Building. She needs a way out.

28:31.176 --> 28:32.242
Where is she exactly?

28:32.243 --> 28:33.477
Where are you exactly?

28:33.478 --> 28:37.005
- An office on the seventh floor.
- An office on the seventh floor.

28:38.850 --> 28:41.051
- Whose office?
- Whose office?

28:41.052 --> 28:43.782
- General Vitali Simonov.
- General Vitali Simonov.

28:43.855 --> 28:46.415
Ask if there's an abstract
painting behind the desk.

28:46.491 --> 28:49.517
Is there an abstract painting
behind the desk?

28:49.594 --> 28:52.094
Yes, yes, yes.

28:52.630 --> 28:56.760
Behind it, there's an activation
switch for a private door.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.321
- What time does this place open?
- Not for another hour.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.890
I'm out, and I've got the map.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.161
Copy, Freelancer.

29:24.162 --> 29:26.662
See you at home.

29:31.169 --> 29:32.903
How do you say "thank you"

29:32.904 --> 29:35.404
to the woman
who killed your father?

29:37.675 --> 29:38.776
You don't.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.989
Sark asked you to work with him?

29:51.990 --> 29:55.551
Like it wasn't even a question.
Like it was a done deal.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.795
Sark is like the good-looking
guy in school

29:57.796 --> 30:01.129
who knows how cute he is and
won't take "no" for an answer.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.193
Any suspicious reactions
to the map you gave SD-6?

30:05.270 --> 30:07.070
No.
They're analyzing it now.

30:07.071 --> 30:10.598
Good. We have a CIA tech
trying to decode the real map.

30:10.675 --> 30:12.142
They're having trouble.

30:12.143 --> 30:15.306
You think Richter used a cipher
text only they could read?

30:15.380 --> 30:17.880
Maybe.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.583
Your mother might be able
to help us with this.

30:22.220 --> 30:25.280
If you're asking me
to go see her again,

30:25.356 --> 30:27.916
she did have a request.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.229
They've been checked
for hidden compartments,

30:32.230 --> 30:34.298
transmitters, passive sensors.

30:34.299 --> 30:36.859
Every sharp edge
has been dulled.

30:37.936 --> 30:41.303
<i>I was 21 years old
when I was given these.</i>

30:41.372 --> 30:46.537
At the graduation from
the academy, my mother...

30:46.611 --> 30:49.111
your grandmother...

30:50.315 --> 30:53.842
...put these in my hands.

30:53.918 --> 30:56.418
I cried.

30:56.821 --> 30:59.346
She said, "Sweetheart,
wear them well. "

30:59.424 --> 31:02.359
You would have liked her...

31:02.427 --> 31:04.927
had things...

31:06.231 --> 31:08.731
...been different.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.874
We need you to decode the map.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.391
I have a request.

31:35.426 --> 31:36.894
Sure.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.929
Mr. Sloane is concerned
about a phone call

31:38.930 --> 31:40.697
he received at home
Thursday night.

31:40.698 --> 31:43.690
<i>The call was traced to
the Barranca Bed & Breakfast</i>

31:43.768 --> 31:46.268
in Sonoma, California.

31:47.038 --> 31:49.206
He's asked me to send
someone to Sonoma,

31:49.207 --> 31:52.335
find out who was staying there,
who might have made the call.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.778
Whatever information
you can get.

31:54.779 --> 31:56.280
Sounds easy enough.

31:56.281 --> 31:58.806
No one's to know about this.

32:00.285 --> 32:02.785
Understood.

32:09.694 --> 32:13.130
Madagascar close to Sambaba.

32:13.197 --> 32:17.099
<i>Latitude.
Minus 14 degrees, 26 minutes.</i>

32:17.168 --> 32:19.728
Longitude.

32:19.804 --> 32:25.106
<i>49 degrees, 57 minutes,
and 20 seconds.</i>

32:30.281 --> 32:31.982
She says the building is clean.

32:31.983 --> 32:34.645
There are no explosives
or anti-intrusion systems.

32:34.719 --> 32:36.887
We can't trust
this information.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.323
Dad, come on.
If she'd wanted me dead,

32:39.324 --> 32:41.849
she could have left me
at FAPSI headquarters.

32:41.926 --> 32:45.760
The only leverage she has is the
information about her agency.

32:45.830 --> 32:47.497
As soon as we get that manual,
she's got nothing.

32:47.498 --> 32:49.499
Unless she wants
to prove herself.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.000
That's the kind of thinking
that will get you killed.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.171
- I'm going in.
- No, you're not.

32:54.172 --> 32:56.006
Irina Derevko
has proved her value.

32:56.007 --> 32:58.342
Do not talk to me
about that woman's value!

32:58.343 --> 33:00.868
Of all people,
you should know better.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.574
We're sending you to Madagascar
to retrieve the bible.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.149
You, too.
Prepare to leave tonight.

33:07.151 --> 33:09.651
I want you to deal with
Sydney's cover at SD-6.

33:09.687 --> 33:12.187
Let's move it.

33:27.872 --> 33:30.107
<i>A team will be in Madagascar
in 12 hours.</i>

33:30.108 --> 33:32.702
I'll need you to have
everything in place by then.

33:32.777 --> 33:35.871
On that timeframe,
I have to parachute in.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.684
Jack, I owe you.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.055
But why 30 pounds of Semtex?

33:45.056 --> 33:48.924
I could do the same job
with 5 pounds of C-4.

33:48.993 --> 33:51.894
I need you to make sure that
if anyone enters that building,

33:51.963 --> 33:54.463
no one will survive.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.771
God grant us the serenity

34:00.772 --> 34:03.434
to accept the things
we cannot change,

34:03.508 --> 34:06.306
courage to change
the things we can,

34:06.377 --> 34:08.877
and wisdom
to know the difference.

34:09.947 --> 34:13.474
Don't forget, next meeting,
Patty's bringing the doughnuts.

34:21.626 --> 34:23.592
Hey. I had a thought.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.495
You and I
could do this together.

34:25.496 --> 34:26.563
Do what together?

34:26.563 --> 34:29.032
Tell me what to do.
Who to contact, what to write.

34:29.033 --> 34:32.092
I can publish it on my web page.
Totally anonymous.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.797
- Rebecca...
- And we could hang out.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.940
Which could be kind of nice.

34:37.942 --> 34:40.210
Do you like frozen yogurt?

34:40.210 --> 34:42.710
I already told you that
the whole thing about SD-6,

34:42.746 --> 34:43.947
it was all fictional.

34:43.947 --> 34:45.782
Will, come on.

34:45.783 --> 34:49.081
Why would anyone, especially
you, make up a story like that?

34:52.422 --> 34:54.690
Okay, just tell me this.

34:54.692 --> 34:57.192
Did they do this to you?

35:00.932 --> 35:03.924
A friend of mine.
Her fiancé was killed.

35:04.001 --> 35:06.436
The police thought it was
a random shooting,

35:06.437 --> 35:09.338
that some guy had broken
into his apartment.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.208
And I was worried about her.

35:11.209 --> 35:13.043
I decided to play hero.

35:13.044 --> 35:15.378
I was gonna find out
who killed him.

35:15.379 --> 35:18.041
And after that, I was gonna...

35:18.116 --> 35:21.449
I don't know, maybe, uh...

35:21.519 --> 35:24.019
Maybe our relationship
would be different.

35:24.989 --> 35:27.514
But the more
that I looked into it,

35:27.592 --> 35:30.092
the less I found.

35:30.161 --> 35:32.028
Then I had to make it up,

35:32.029 --> 35:34.498
because it was more important
not to let her down

35:34.499 --> 35:37.662
than it was for me
to just be honest with her.

35:37.735 --> 35:40.499
So, you want to look
into SD-6...

35:40.571 --> 35:44.234
hey, good luck.

35:50.715 --> 35:52.849
Will Tippin
shouldn't be a problem.

35:52.850 --> 35:55.648
I gave him a number
of opportunities,

35:55.720 --> 35:57.821
all recorded on audio files,

35:57.822 --> 36:00.190
to restart
his SD-6 investigation.

36:00.191 --> 36:02.716
Tippin never took the bait.

36:02.793 --> 36:04.594
Security Section's seen that?

36:04.595 --> 36:08.759
Yes. And they're classifying
Tippin as a non-threat.

36:10.234 --> 36:12.734
Good.

36:19.944 --> 36:21.611
Did you talk to the desk clerk?

36:21.612 --> 36:23.046
Yes, I did, sir.

36:23.047 --> 36:25.948
The Barranca Inn has no way
of linking a back trace

36:26.017 --> 36:28.542
from an outside line
to an individual room.

36:28.619 --> 36:31.520
We don't know which room it was
that called your home,

36:31.589 --> 36:36.151
but we do know who was staying
at the inn that night.

36:46.804 --> 36:49.637
Is that your wife's signature?

37:13.631 --> 37:15.532
Freelancer has reached
the target and is heading

37:15.533 --> 37:18.033
toward position.

37:20.471 --> 37:23.065
We have you on-screen,
Freelancer.

37:32.717 --> 37:35.217
There's the house.

37:37.021 --> 37:39.521
Freelancer's going in.

37:42.793 --> 37:45.293
We're at the door.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.929
Can you switch from real-time
radar scan to infrared?

37:56.007 --> 37:58.507
Switching to infrared.

38:04.148 --> 38:06.249
Sydney, hold your entry.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.183
What is it, Dad?

38:07.184 --> 38:09.778
The building is wired
to explode.

38:09.854 --> 38:11.488
See how these don't give off

38:11.489 --> 38:13.556
the same amount of heat
as the surrounding structure?

38:13.557 --> 38:16.685
- They're not made of wood.
- What are they made of?

38:16.761 --> 38:20.527
Sydney, look under the house.
Is there a crawl space?

38:58.903 --> 39:01.403
She lied to me.

39:05.276 --> 39:07.377
Sydney, come on.

39:07.378 --> 39:09.878
We're pulling back.

39:12.383 --> 39:16.046
If she was counting on my trust,
that I would walk in there

39:16.120 --> 39:17.487
and set off the explosives,

39:17.488 --> 39:18.922
then why did she help us
get this far?

39:18.923 --> 39:20.490
There are enough explosives

39:20.491 --> 39:23.051
to blow this place,
operation manual included.

39:23.127 --> 39:26.062
Your mother was using us
to destroy it for her.

39:26.130 --> 39:28.131
Secure the perimeter until...

39:32.603 --> 39:34.003
Your reconnaissance work

39:34.004 --> 39:36.239
saved us the trouble
of using our GPS.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.740
Thank you.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.974
Go inside and recover
the operations manual.

39:47.418 --> 39:49.886
You escaped tactical directorate
after lockdown.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.387
Clearly you had no trouble
decoding the map.

39:52.456 --> 39:55.789
I'm surprised Richter was so
willing to reveal his secrets.

39:55.860 --> 39:59.057
If I didn't know better, I'd
guess you had another source.

40:01.866 --> 40:04.366
Sydney! Sydney!

40:14.478 --> 40:16.813
Where's Sark?

40:16.814 --> 40:19.314
They're gone.

40:28.359 --> 40:30.859
Sydney, are you okay?

40:31.228 --> 40:33.496
We're okay, Dad.

40:33.497 --> 40:35.997
We're coming home.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.145
This is Kendall.

40:49.146 --> 40:51.910
I want Irina Derevko
removed from this facility.

40:51.982 --> 40:55.440
Transferred to Camp Harris
for unrestricted interrogation.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.354
She'll be gone within the hour.

40:58.355 --> 41:00.390
You were right about her, Jack.

41:00.391 --> 41:02.891
You were right.

41:05.196 --> 41:09.599
<i>If I build a wall</i>

41:09.667 --> 41:13.831
<i>A hundred feet tall</i>

41:13.904 --> 41:19.809
<i>Would that keep you in?</i>

41:19.877 --> 41:24.814
<i>If I shackled your feet</i>

41:24.882 --> 41:29.080
<i>So you couldn't leave</i>

41:29.153 --> 41:35.490
<i>Would you try and run?</i>

41:53.978 --> 41:57.744
<i>If I promise
not to fight...</i>

41:57.815 --> 42:00.340
I thought there
might have been a chance

42:00.417 --> 42:02.917
to believe...

42:03.921 --> 42:07.379
To believe that she had
no hidden agenda.

42:19.603 --> 42:22.103
Everything you said was right.

42:27.678 --> 42:30.178
And I was so stupid.

42:35.085 --> 42:37.585
I'm sorry, Dad.

42:41.258 --> 42:43.954
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

42:48.299 --> 42:50.799
I'm sorry, Dad.
