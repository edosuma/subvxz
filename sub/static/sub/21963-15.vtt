Everybody should know
that we're a group, right?

00:31.335 --> 00:33.076
Shouldn't this say "B.U."?

00:36.123 --> 00:39.343
MERV: I got a meeting
this morning over in Sonoma.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.258
Uh, we're having lunch
in a windmill.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.608
Hey, don't embarrass me
today, okay?

00:45.393 --> 00:48.483
MAX: Oh, my God, I think I just
figured out the universe.

00:48.526 --> 00:51.138
Space-time is folded
within itself,

00:51.181 --> 00:54.228
infinitely,
in layers of triangles.

00:54.271 --> 00:56.143
Well, that's a load off my mind.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.535
No, no, no. Don't you see?

00:57.579 --> 00:59.276
It connects
to the Triangle Group

00:59.320 --> 01:00.886
that Ava found out about,

01:00.930 --> 01:03.063
the bugging--
it's all connected.

01:05.587 --> 01:08.024
Hey, so, we're fired?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.373

Yeah.

Maybe not exactly
the way you do.

I'm excited to be working
in the big leagues, though.

All right, listen up, people.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.222
Here's what we know.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.268
At 11:56 p.m.,

01:34.311 --> 01:37.923
Captain Mia Alvarez took off
from Mexico City, here,

01:37.967 --> 01:39.925
en route to Anchorage.

01:39.969 --> 01:42.928
Four minutes in, the pilot saw
a strange flash of light.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.366
She then landed here,

01:45.409 --> 01:48.586
over 2,000 miles
from the point of departure.

01:48.630 --> 01:52.590
A trip that should have taken
approximately five hours

01:52.634 --> 01:55.027
took four minutes
and 11 seconds.

01:55.071 --> 01:58.205
-[whistles]
-So what the hell happened?

01:58.248 --> 02:00.076
Well, that's up to you
to figure out, today.

FAA agents, you've got
the plane here to examine.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.429
FBI, the pilot is in a hospital

02:05.473 --> 02:07.562

for questioning.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.955
And I take it
you guys are the B.U.

02:09.999 --> 02:12.306
-That's correct, sir.
-Uh,

02:12.349 --> 02:14.525
folks, if you're not familiar
with the Bureau Underground,

02:14.569 --> 02:16.745
they are our paranormal...

02:16.788 --> 02:19.443
-experts, um...
-[soft laughter]

02:19.487 --> 02:21.402
but apparently
you guys are the ones

02:21.445 --> 02:23.404
who can pull magic
out of a hat, so,

02:23.447 --> 02:26.276
if you have any idea
where I can find an assistant

02:26.320 --> 02:28.626
who doesn't fart
in the helicopter,

02:28.670 --> 02:29.758
-let me know.

At 4:00, I brief the president.

02:33.675 --> 02:34.980
Let's go.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.765
All right, since Merv is out

02:36.808 --> 02:39.289
terrorizing the countryside
with his silhouette,

02:39.333 --> 02:41.248
it looks like this is on me.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.597
So let's get organized.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.989
I want...

02:50.126 --> 02:51.519
Oh.

02:52.868 --> 02:56.306
-Yeah. This feels right.
-What?

02:56.350 --> 02:58.439
I thought you guys were
wearing masks of other people.

02:58.482 --> 02:59.570
Track all this.

02:59.614 --> 03:00.832

-Hello there.

03:04.532 --> 03:07.143
Hello there, I'm Alfie Corliss.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.362
If you're done
with the black box,

03:08.405 --> 03:10.625
we would like
a few moments with it.

03:10.668 --> 03:11.930
[laughs softly]

03:11.974 --> 03:13.715
You want to have
a few moments with it?

03:13.758 --> 03:15.673
-Yeah.
-You're gonna walk
on the beach with it?

03:15.717 --> 03:18.372
Nice, quiet dinner and then
slip your hand up its skirt?

03:18.415 --> 03:19.634
-Maybe.
-[laughs]

03:19.677 --> 03:21.070
MAX:
Uh, no.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.376
We... I mean, we just want

03:22.419 --> 03:23.507
to study the flight data.

03:23.551 --> 03:25.074
Oh, right.
I'm s... I am so sorry.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.945
I was very rude to you.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.513
Y-You want to check to see
if there's a ghost in the box?

03:29.557 --> 03:31.254
-[laughter]
-Oh, oh. I'm so sor...
-Not real... That...

03:31.298 --> 03:33.691
Like, look, we don't have
the fancy detecting stuff

03:33.735 --> 03:35.519
that you guys have,
like the-like the backpacks

03:35.563 --> 03:38.957
that have, like, you know, CGI
effects and all of that stuff.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.177
But there's nothing spooky
in the black box.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.526
-Okay, Shaggy?
-[Leroy laughs]

03:42.570 --> 03:46.487
I see it, actu... um...

03:46.530 --> 03:49.272
You have to coax the ghost out

03:49.316 --> 03:51.100
-with ghost bait.
-Oh.

03:51.143 --> 03:52.884
Don't feel bad,
don't expect you to know

03:52.928 --> 03:54.886
-about the special bait.
-[chuckles]

03:54.930 --> 03:56.932
Seriously, though.
When can we see the box?

03:58.499 --> 04:01.415
Gentlemen, we're still
working with the box.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.547
We'll let you know
when we're done, okay?

04:03.591 --> 04:06.550
So why don't you go back
to the Mystery Machine,

-have your Scooby Snacks...

Wow. Okay.

Uh, we have some questions
for the pilot.

Is one of them, "Were you Amelia
Earhart in a previous life?"

Yeah? Good.

-Hey!
-Ooh... Oh, hello.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.538
CORLISS:
What the hell are you doing?

04:37.581 --> 04:39.583
Well, the, uh, engine's
a little high to look into,

04:39.627 --> 04:41.106
and the ladder,
when you climb it,

04:41.150 --> 04:42.282
it makes you higher.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.459
Okay, Bureau Underground,

04:45.502 --> 04:47.896
I think you're aware that
you're not qualified to be here,

04:47.939 --> 04:50.551
so can you please
just kind of...

04:50.594 --> 04:52.509
stay out of everyone's way?

04:52.553 --> 04:54.294
Thank you.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.820

I'd like to punch that guy

04:58.863 --> 05:01.344
right in the penis.

05:01.388 --> 05:04.826
You don't mean
"kick him in the balls"?

05:04.869 --> 05:07.176
Well, either way.

05:15.837 --> 05:19.623
It was on Merv to tell us
we had to bring our own lunches.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.017
Well, perhaps he's getting us
a spread, maybe a Mediterranean.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.759
He ain't bringing
a Mediterranean spread.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.021
Let's just order a pizza.

05:26.064 --> 05:28.284
It'll take too long to get here.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.590
I'll be the problem solver.

05:29.633 --> 05:30.808
MAX:
Bird, what are you doing?

05:30.852 --> 05:34.464
Uh, does anyone have
any leftover food?!

05:34.508 --> 05:36.074
-[whispering]: Bird, no.
-Oh, my gosh.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.424
LEROY:
Dude.

05:37.467 --> 05:38.990

We forgot to bring food!

05:39.034 --> 05:42.516

Don't look at him.

05:42.559 --> 05:43.560

05:46.302 --> 05:47.825
He's collecting garbage.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.392
SHAKER:
We got some crusts.

05:51.438 --> 05:52.656
Are you serious?

05:52.700 --> 05:53.962
Can we just go?

05:54.005 --> 05:56.094
I mean, how much more
humiliation can we take?

05:56.138 --> 05:58.619
-MAN: Here you go!
-MAX: I can't...

05:58.662 --> 06:00.490

Got an orange.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.363

06:08.933 --> 06:11.458
No more humiliation.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.330
We are gonna solve this case.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.680
We are.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.508
They don't know anything
about paranormal.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.467
They have no training.

06:20.510 --> 06:23.557
They don't have dope sky blue
vests with the P.U. swag.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.472
Only we can solve this.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.651
Where is he going?

06:30.694 --> 06:32.435
DAVEY:
Sneaking over into their area.

06:32.479 --> 06:33.697
Do they see him?

06:33.741 --> 06:34.698
Oh, my God.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.004
He's taking the black box.

06:36.047 --> 06:38.354
He's taking
the black box.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.269
Yes, Leroy.

-No, don't clap.

-They were supposed to share.

-This is on them.
-A plane can't go 2,000 miles

It shouldn't come to that.

They're quite high up,
but, yes, in principle.

06:59.723 --> 07:03.292
Great. Davey, Annie, Sasha,
get to that pilot.

07:03.335 --> 07:06.338
-I'll get to her.
-She'll wish she were dead.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.732
No, just be polite.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.039
Stay low. Stay sneaky. Go.

Yeah. Okay.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.526

Yeah, okay.

[keys clattering]

07:38.675 --> 07:40.372
Oh.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.505
Captain, what altitude
were you at

07:42.549 --> 07:43.767
when you first noticed
the flash of light?

07:43.811 --> 07:46.204
[phone rings]

07:46.248 --> 07:48.206
Hello?

07:48.250 --> 07:49.947
ANNIE: Captain Alvarez,
did it feel like

07:49.991 --> 07:52.733
you were flying for only
four minutes or five hours?

07:52.776 --> 07:54.735
ALVAREZ: Well, it kind of
felt like both.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.650
-Okay, who is that?
-BIRD: Captain Alvarez,

07:56.693 --> 07:58.434
do you still have
your belly button?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.609
ALVAREZ:
My belly button?

07:59.653 --> 08:01.742
You! Hang up right now!

08:01.785 --> 08:03.744
-LEROY: What you got?
-I don't know. Look at this.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.789
There was an attempt made
to contact the airplane

08:05.833 --> 08:07.791
just before the pilot claims
to have seen the light.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.880
-Mm-hmm.
-But check out
where the call came from.

08:09.924 --> 08:13.014
"RXD." That's an airport code.
So?

08:13.057 --> 08:15.364
Well, there is no airport
with that code.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.801
-[exhales]
-LaFREY:
Barry, what happened to you?

08:17.845 --> 08:19.890
This volcanic ash is
from the wing of the plane.

08:19.934 --> 08:23.590
New theory: the plane flew
into a flying volcano.

08:23.633 --> 08:26.462
Hold up, something doesn't
sound plausible, but...

08:26.506 --> 08:28.464
There was no active volcano
on the flight path.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.813
There's a dormant volcano,

08:29.857 --> 08:31.641
but it hasn't erupted
for hundreds of years.

08:31.685 --> 08:35.471
Hey. There isn't an airport with
a code RXD, but there will be.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.213
Shedsrock Construction
has a permit to build one

08:38.256 --> 08:42.043
in Durango, Mexico,
with ground breaking in 2023.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.698
What?

08:44.741 --> 08:46.743
Oh, my God.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.745
Holy cow. Mamma mia.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.834
-What are you...?
-Leroy, mamma mia. Mamma...

You took it.

did you losesomething?

-You lost the black box?

about this.

-They lost the black box?

-Yes.

How do you lose a black box?

maybe it's on your table.

-Don't.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.608
Not ever. We're gonna...

10:52.652 --> 10:55.045

to whatever theory they have,

10:55.089 --> 10:56.873
we're gonna nod our heads
in agreement,

10:56.917 --> 10:58.962
and then we're gonna get
on our special bus

10:59.006 --> 11:00.398
and we're going home.

11:00.442 --> 11:03.271
But we have to tell Katzenberg
at the very least.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.795

11:05.839 --> 11:09.843

11:15.326 --> 11:18.939
It's nice to have him back.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.723
Then we discovered
our next aberration.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.769
There were a set of keys
found in one of the engines.

11:22.812 --> 11:25.423
And based on the style
and color of the key chain,

11:25.467 --> 11:27.512
plus a little, rubber
flip-flop ornament,

11:27.556 --> 11:30.167
we created a profile
of a single, middle-aged woman

11:30.211 --> 11:32.996

outside of the country.

one truth

12:33.448 --> 12:35.580

12:35.624 --> 12:39.454
The pilot claims that she
did travel for five hours.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.935
En route, the plane was
contacted by an airport

12:41.978 --> 12:43.675
that hasn't been built yet

12:43.719 --> 12:46.853

volcano that hasn't erupted yet.

And as you reach the point
of a triangle

13:03.695 --> 13:06.437
in accordance with the theory
of Gromov's hyperbolic groups,

13:06.481 --> 13:09.266
two layers of time get
very close together.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.877
Very close.

Well, you look like
a greeter from Best Buy.

19:38.394 --> 19:41.441
Like, I want to buy
a Blu-ray player from you.

19:41.484 --> 19:44.313
I'll sell you a Blu-ray player.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.663
Well, let's sell each other
Blu-ray players.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.230
That's some weird-ass flirting.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.433
How?

20:17.477 --> 20:19.087
No, you're too drunk.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.262
Now, give me that fleece.

20:20.306 --> 20:21.698
You're just gonna lose it.

Just remember to give it back.

20:26.486 --> 20:27.791
Just kidding.

20:29.445 --> 20:30.925
Oh.

20:30.968 --> 20:33.449
[laughs]

20:33.493 --> 20:36.278
You see, now this ends up
not being so embarrassing,

20:36.322 --> 20:39.542
because you get a job
teaching physics

[thunder rumbling]

21:03.349 --> 21:04.872
Okay.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.917
You can't tell him.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.658
What he does
with that information,

21:08.702 --> 21:10.791
-he tells...
-Yes, da, ba, da, do, bo, ba.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.140
I hear you.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.798
Oh, look.

21:17.841 --> 21:21.149
