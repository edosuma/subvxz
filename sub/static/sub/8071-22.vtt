[theme music]

00:10.378 --> 00:13.981
Well, I got good news.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.516
I got a promotion.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.618
So in three weeks,
I'm afraid to say,

00:17.718 --> 00:21.189
I will no longer be your boss.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.856
Go ahead, get it over with.

00:22.956 --> 00:23.757
DY-NO-MITE.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.726
All right!

00:25.826 --> 00:28.262
Yeah, I knew you'd
be happy for me.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.164
Well, what'd they make you?

00:30.264 --> 00:33.501
I am director of
human resources.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.169
Wow, congratulations.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.170
Thank you.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.938
So what is that exactly?

00:38.038 --> 00:39.807
I have no idea.

00:39.907 --> 00:42.843
But I'm sure there'll be
some literature in the desk.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.279
So, um, who's going to
manage the restaurant?

00:45.379 --> 00:47.915
Well, my guess
would be a director

00:48.015 --> 00:49.750
of human resources wannabe.

00:49.850 --> 00:54.054
Well, Leon, look, let
me be the first to say

00:54.155 --> 00:57.125
that although we haven't
always seen eye to eye

00:57.225 --> 00:59.560
you have always been fair.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.663
And I really enjoy
working with you.

01:02.763 --> 01:06.767
Well, thank you, Bonnie.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.202
Bonnie: [clears throat]

01:08.302 --> 01:11.505
What?

[theme music]

01:59.019 --> 02:00.020
[phone ringing]

02:01.021 --> 02:02.223
DJ, get the phone.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.258
If it's Dean, tell
him I'm not home.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.759
You're closer.

02:05.859 --> 02:06.994
Get it.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.329
Gimme a dollar.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.230
A quarter.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.564
A quarter?

02:10.664 --> 02:11.532
And I won't pound you.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.433
Now go!

02:12.533 --> 02:13.801
All right.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.039
Yeah?

02:19.139 --> 02:20.308
Hi, Dean.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.776
No, Becky says to tell you
she's not here right now.

02:22.876 --> 02:23.711
DJ!

02:23.811 --> 02:27.448
That's what you
get for a quarter.

02:27.548 --> 02:30.418
You're dead you little rodent!

02:30.518 --> 02:32.520
Hi, Dean.

02:32.620 --> 02:36.324
No, he didn't understand,
being he's kind of slow.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.225
Saturday?

02:37.325 --> 02:38.292
Geez.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.695
No, I'm going out
with my friend, Dana.

02:41.795 --> 02:45.499
Who, by the way, told me she
thinks you're really cute.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.735
Yeah.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.137
No, call her, I wouldn't mind.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.639
Great.
OK.

02:51.739 --> 02:52.773
Bye.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.308
Look, Dana is going to
call in a few minutes.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.343
Will you tell her I'm not home?

02:55.443 --> 02:57.478
Got it.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.047
So how was your trip?

03:00.147 --> 03:03.851
1,200 miles in three days.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.687
First time I ever
hold livestock.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.590
Stunk like hell, but it's nice
to have somebody to talk to.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.162
So, looks like you're
still avoiding Dean.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.297
Yeah.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.866
I don't know, he seems
like a nice enough guy.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.435
Well, maybe I'm shallow,
but he gets these pit

03:21.535 --> 03:22.403
stains you wouldn't believe.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.073
Been there.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.578
Have you seen Mark at all?

03:30.678 --> 03:31.779
Just that one time.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.414
We ended up yelling
at each other.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.415
It'll get better.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.384
I don't know.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.051
I mean, I'm lonely,
I'm sad, I feel

03:38.151 --> 03:39.453
like I'm never going
to meet another guy I

03:39.553 --> 03:41.322
really care about.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.690
I mean, this has got
to be like the worst

03:42.790 --> 03:44.258
time of my entire life.

03:44.358 --> 03:48.061
No, Becky.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.029
No.

03:49.129 --> 03:49.963
No.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.832
The worst time in
your entire life

03:51.932 --> 03:53.767
is going to be when
you're all those things

03:53.867 --> 03:56.036
and you smell like beef.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.971
You think you
could keep your paws

03:58.071 --> 03:59.307
off me for like one minute?

03:59.407 --> 04:00.641
I was just holding your hand.

04:00.741 --> 04:01.742
Well, I'm sick of it.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.211
So back off, OK?

04:04.312 --> 04:07.381
Oh god, I miss
having a boyfriend.

04:07.481 --> 04:10.451
We walk to school together
like every single day.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.185
You're outside every
one of my classes.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.587
You put your arm around
me in the hallway.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.088
You're my girlfriend.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.925
Yeah, well, I liked it better
before when you were David

04:18.025 --> 04:19.026
and I was Darlene.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.594
Now we're like this
David Darlene creature,

04:20.694 --> 04:24.732
like we were fused together
in some nuclear accident.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.500
So I won't put
my arm around you.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.068
Look, that's not what I mean.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.470
I just don't think we
need to be together

04:29.570 --> 04:30.638
every single moment of my life.

04:30.738 --> 04:31.572
OK.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.674
Now, I'm going
upstairs to read.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.108
I'm going to do that alone.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.877
Do you think you can handle it?

04:36.977 --> 04:38.379
Fine.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.848
You can stay up there all
day, I'm not following you.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.316
If you want me, you
know where to find me.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.765
You must be pretty
happy Leon's leaving.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.367
Well, I don't know.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.902
You know, I'm mean to him all
the time, then I come home

05:02.002 --> 05:03.337
and I felt really guilty.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.705
So now that he's
leaving at least

05:04.805 --> 05:07.240
I can stop punishing myself.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.943
Well, thanks for waiting.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.913
Well, you left to go
over to Crystal's for 10

05:13.013 --> 05:14.247
minutes over an hour ago.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.484
She's driving me crazy.

05:16.584 --> 05:17.918
What was it this time?

05:18.018 --> 05:19.453
The thermostat.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.222
You just replaced
that thermostat.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.057
Well, apparently
the house is still

05:24.157 --> 05:25.826
either too hot or too cold.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.028
Well, yeah, because
she's eight months pregnant

05:28.128 --> 05:29.930
and she keeps on having
hot and cold flashes.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.165
You know, I suggested
that, but she assured me

05:32.265 --> 05:33.066
that wasn't the case.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.102
Then she kicked me.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.370
You're kidding.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.671
Then she started
crying and there was

05:37.771 --> 05:40.107
no way I could kick her back.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.109
Well, when's
Grandpa coming home?

05:42.209 --> 05:43.677
Three days.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.813
At which time she
his problem again.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.481
This gravy is cold.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.349
Hmm, give it to me.
I'll nuke it.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.389
Where's Darlene?

05:55.489 --> 05:57.791
Oh, well.

05:57.891 --> 06:02.029
Her and David had a little
tiff so she's up in her room.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.665
What's he doing here?

06:04.765 --> 06:06.667
Well, I'd already invited him.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.802
And then when she said
it was either her or him

06:08.902 --> 06:10.938
I flipped the coin until he won.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.244
Here ya go, David.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.879
Oh, thanks.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.280
This is an incredible dinner.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.348
Everything is really great.

06:21.449 --> 06:22.983
Well, why don't you
come back tomorrow.

06:23.083 --> 06:23.884
We're having it again.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.825
You know what I was thinking?

06:31.925 --> 06:32.960
Have they replaced Leon yet?

06:33.060 --> 06:35.195
No, he says they're
still looking.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.030
Well, why don't you
try for that manager job?

06:37.130 --> 06:38.098
I couldn't get it.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.600
Why not?

06:39.700 --> 06:40.768
You help manage the shop.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.235
You run the house.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.771
You could ask Leon
for a reference.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.606
That could never happen, Dan.

06:45.706 --> 06:49.610
I'd have to suck up
at the speed of light.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.880
- I'm not getting it anymore.
- I know that's Crystal.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.515
I already talked to
her 50 times today.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.415
I'm not home.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.416
I'll get it.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.851
If it's Crystal,
I'll talk to Crystal.

06:57.951 --> 06:58.919
If it's Dana--

06:59.019 --> 07:00.387
If it's Dean or
Dana, you're not home.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.388
I know.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.856
Hello?

07:02.956 --> 07:04.157
Yeah.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.125
Yeah, just a second.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.026
David, it's your mom.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.094
Tell her I'm in the shower.

07:15.936 --> 07:16.870
Good morning, Leon.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.171
Good morning.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.473
Roseanne, what are you doing?

07:19.573 --> 07:22.142
Oh, well, we were slow, so
I had the florist bring up

07:22.242 --> 07:24.678
some flowers, you know, to kind
of cheer the place up a little.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.946
Really?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.380
Yeah, you sound surprised.

07:27.481 --> 07:31.519
Well, I mean forgive me, but
usually when there's nothing

07:31.619 --> 07:34.655
to do, that's what you do.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.691
Well, I've decided
not to do that anymore.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.160
It sets a bad example
for the staff.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.696
I see, that's-- that's good.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.831
Yeah.

07:43.931 --> 07:47.535
And I made the cook
wash his hands.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.870
Well, I am
impressed, Roseanne.

07:49.970 --> 07:50.771
Morning.

07:50.871 --> 07:51.905
Good morning, Bonnie.

07:52.005 --> 07:56.443
Say, this sudden
spurt of efficiency,

07:56.544 --> 07:58.078
it wouldn't have anything
to do with the fact

07:58.178 --> 08:00.848
that my old job is up
for grabs now, would it?

08:00.948 --> 08:01.849
Well, why not?

08:01.949 --> 08:03.116
I can do it.

08:03.216 --> 08:08.188
Although, not nearly
as good as you.

08:08.288 --> 08:12.425
Ooh, that last part
had to hurt, huh?

08:12.526 --> 08:13.694
Oh, what do you say, Leon.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.495
Could you give me
a reference please?

08:15.596 --> 08:17.598
Sure.
I'm out of here.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.768
Let the whole place burn down.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.703
Hold on a minute,
you're not going

08:22.803 --> 08:25.172
to give her the same
reference you gave me are you?

08:25.272 --> 08:26.974
Hey, you went and
applied for that job

08:27.074 --> 08:28.441
without even
telling me about it?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.210
Wait a minute, OK?

08:30.310 --> 08:33.213
Leon, you know I've put in
twice as many hours as she does

08:33.313 --> 08:36.083
and you know I work a hell of
a lot harder than she does.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.118
- Hey.
- Come on, Leon.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.286
No, no.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.589
I'm sorry, but it's
not right that I get

08:41.689 --> 08:43.456
in the middle of this since--

08:43.557 --> 08:44.357
I don't care.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.363
Why are you trying
to sink me with Leon?

08:50.463 --> 08:52.365
I'm not.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.802
Look Roseanne, I can
really use this job.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.169
And I just want
the people upstairs

08:56.269 --> 08:58.238
to know there's a difference
between you and I. That's all.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.139
What difference?

08:59.239 --> 09:00.708
There's no difference.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.375
Come on, Roseanne.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.912
I'm here full time,
you're here part time.

09:05.012 --> 09:08.048
You take breaks any time you
want, you're always late,

09:08.148 --> 09:10.183
and you're mean
to the customers.

09:10.283 --> 09:13.220
I am not mean.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.589
I'm crusty.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.458
Well, I take this
job very seriously.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.729
You know, gruff, but lovable.

09:21.829 --> 09:24.097
I'm just saying that
I work really hard

09:24.197 --> 09:25.699
and I think I'll
be a great manager.

09:25.799 --> 09:26.767
Oh, and I wouldn't?

09:26.867 --> 09:28.468
I don't think so.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.037
I think you'd end
up getting a raise

09:30.137 --> 09:32.405
and I end up covering
for you like I always do.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.474
Well, how come you've never
said any of this before?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.677
Because you never wanted
to be my boss before.

09:36.777 --> 09:40.013
All right, but now you
are going to be my boss.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.782
And because I'm such
a lousy waitress

09:41.882 --> 09:43.984
I suppose the first thing
you're going to do is fire me.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.418
I would not.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.557
And you call yourself
management material.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.000
Hey.

10:00.100 --> 10:00.901
Hey.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.202
OK, I closed the shop down.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.103
I'm here.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.037
What's the big emergency?

10:04.137 --> 10:05.639
The dryer is not working.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.507
Is it really not
working or does

10:07.607 --> 10:08.742
she think it's not working?

10:08.842 --> 10:09.810
No, this one's real.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.611
Did you check the circuit box?

10:11.712 --> 10:12.813
She wouldn't let me.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.414
She thinks anyone who
has to touch the thing is

10:14.514 --> 10:15.482
going to get electrocuted.

10:15.582 --> 10:16.549
So she called me.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.752
Yup.

10:18.852 --> 10:19.953
Where is she?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.588
Putting little Ed
down for his nap.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.657
Well, maybe I can
handle this and get out

10:23.757 --> 10:24.892
of her before she comes back.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.895
Take me with you.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.529
Come on now, Lonnie.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.965
One more month and you'll
have your real mother back.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.671
God, I'm good.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.007
Lonnie, did you
do your book report?

10:40.107 --> 10:40.908
Yes.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.309
Don't take that tone with me.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.277
OK, I'll do it again.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.514
- Did you fix my dryer?
- Yes, I did.

10:47.614 --> 10:48.882
Well, what took you so long?

10:48.982 --> 10:52.485
Little Ed had to take his nap
without his favorite shirt.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.154
And you're certainly welcome.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.322
Well, gotta go.
- Oh, fine.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.556
Go.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.159
Just like your father, never
around when I need help.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.328
Well, that's
not fair, Crystal.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.463
I mean, I did close down
the shop just to come

11:03.563 --> 11:05.198
over here and throw a switch.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.167
And I've done a million
little things around here just

11:07.267 --> 11:08.168
to help out.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.303
I think I deserve
better than that.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.604
Well like what?

11:11.705 --> 11:12.773
What do you want
me to do, pay ya?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.141
No.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.809
Well, maybe I should since
I've been such a darn nuisance.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.710
Crystal, come on.

11:16.810 --> 11:17.610
Stop this.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.079
I'll write you a check.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.548
I mean it, Crystal, I
really don't appreciate it.

11:21.648 --> 11:22.850
How's $50?

11:22.950 --> 11:24.752
Will that make it easier to
help out a family member?

11:24.852 --> 11:26.453
OK, that's it.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.655
Look, I know you're
pregnant and everything,

11:28.756 --> 11:31.158
but you're way out of line here.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.960
I've been taking a lot of
crap off of you for the--

11:33.060 --> 11:34.762
[yelp]
last three weeks, and I-- what?

11:34.862 --> 11:35.963
I think I'm in labor.

11:36.063 --> 11:36.964
Oh god, I'm sorry.

11:37.064 --> 11:37.865
I didn't mean it.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.967
You didn't do it, Dan.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.269
I've been having
contractions all morning.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.038
I thought it was false
labor, but this is it.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.373
Well, it's a month
early, Crystal.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.674
Well, you want me
to hold it in, Dan?

11:47.775 --> 11:49.009
OK.
OK.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.710
OK, let's go.
Lonnie, showtime.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.179
I've got a bag packed.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.080
It's in the closet.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.714
OK, Lonnie your mom's ready.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.649
Listen, call Becky,
and she'll pick

11:56.750 --> 11:58.518
you up and bring you and
little Ed over to the hospital.

11:58.618 --> 11:59.887
Tell her to call Mrs.
Conner at the mall.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.789
I'll get The bag.
- You gonna be OK, Mom?

12:01.889 --> 12:02.890
Yes, Lonnie.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.291
You just take care of
your little brother.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.393
And honey, I promise
this is the last one.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.102
[heavy breathing]

12:18.605 --> 12:21.141
This better be a girl.
It better be a girl.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.242
Oh, come on now, Crystal.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.610
If it's a boy you'll
love it just as much.

12:23.710 --> 12:24.812
The hell I will.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.318
What do we do now?

12:31.418 --> 12:34.154
Cleansing breath.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.522
OK.
OK.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.423
You're doing good.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.324
You, too.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.259
You, too.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.293
How's it going?

12:40.393 --> 12:41.594
Oh, about four minutes apart.

12:41.694 --> 12:42.495
OK.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.564
Here's some ice chips.

12:44.664 --> 12:45.866
OK?

12:45.966 --> 12:47.734
Baby seems fine.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.037
A little early,
but in good shape.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.205
My first child was early.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.108
Actually, so was my second.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.644
I probably should have
mentioned that to someone.

12:57.744 --> 12:58.979
It's OK.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.080
We can handle it.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.348
Dan.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.449
Dan.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.118
There's a video camera
in my overnight bag.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.320
Ed wanted to take
pictures of the birth.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.989
So if he doesn't get here
in time could you do it?

13:09.089 --> 13:10.824
- He'll be here.
- But, but if he's not.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.125
Well, Roseanne
is a back-up coach.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.060
She'll be here.
- But if she's not--

13:13.160 --> 13:14.327
- She'll be here.
- Now Dan--

13:14.427 --> 13:15.762
I don't want to look,
Crystal, and you can't make me.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.133
Dad.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.935
I called home and
there was no answer.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.537
And we called the restaurant
and mom already left.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.973
Bonnie's going to
track her down for us.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.307
What about your grandfather?

13:27.407 --> 13:29.309
Oh, we left messages at the
hotel in the branch office

13:29.409 --> 13:30.477
in Seattle.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.046
Say, Darlene, would
you like to see a miracle

13:33.146 --> 13:34.581
through the eye of a camera?

13:34.681 --> 13:35.482
Gross.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.549
Ah, ah.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.484
Uh-oh, breath.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.952
Oh, you breath, Dan.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.387
- Oh, come on, let's go.
- Shut up.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.521
I don't have to listen to you.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.256
It'll hurt a lot less
if you do the breathing.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.458
Oh, Dan, I hate your father.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.394
He did this to me and
he should be here.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.730
He is the scum of the earth.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.664
You know, you're right.

13:51.764 --> 13:52.565
He shouldn't miss this.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.168
Hold on.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.669
OK, take it from
"scum of the earth."

14:05.212 --> 14:07.580
[phone ringing]

14:09.149 --> 14:10.350
Hello.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.518
Oh, hi Bonnie.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.752
Are you calling to apologize?

14:12.852 --> 14:13.653
No?

14:13.753 --> 14:14.554
Well.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.861
You're being very
immature about this.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.964
You don't understand, Jackie.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.133
She insulted me, she hurt me.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.034
OK?

14:27.134 --> 14:28.435
I'm the one that's right.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.237
And when you're right you can be
as immature as you want to be.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.575
[phone beeping]

14:40.981 --> 14:44.084
This isn't driving you crazy?

14:44.184 --> 14:47.587
No, I like it.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.991
Well, I can't take it anymore.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.225
What are you doing?

14:52.325 --> 14:53.293
Get away from there.
- No.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.394
No.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.063
What if it's one of your
kids trying to call?

14:56.163 --> 14:57.630
Well, then I really
don't want to get it.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.531
Aah!

14:58.631 --> 15:00.000
You pinched me!

15:00.100 --> 15:01.969
Yeah, I know.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.037
Next time I'll break your thumb.

15:04.137 --> 15:04.938
Hey.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.273
Hi.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.342
Cool fight.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.978
What are you doing here David?

15:11.078 --> 15:11.979
I'm looking for Darlene.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.613
Well, she's not home yet.

15:13.713 --> 15:16.116
OK.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.017
What's for dinner?

15:19.886 --> 15:20.687
Sit down, David.

15:20.787 --> 15:21.588
Let's talk.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.090
All right.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.431
You don't live here.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.436
I know.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.670
I hang around too much.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.639
Am I like driving
everybody crazy?

15:39.739 --> 15:42.675
Well, actually everybody
thinks you're pretty cool.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.545
You know, except
for your girlfriend.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.048
It's that space
thing, isn't it?

15:48.148 --> 15:51.751
You are really
crowding her, David.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.187
You better back off and
give her some time to think.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.388
OK.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.025
But what if while I'm
giving her all this space

15:58.125 --> 15:59.126
another guy moves in.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.994
And then she decides
she likes him better?

16:01.094 --> 16:03.596
Well, it's good that
you find that out now.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.565
Because if she's going to
be that kind of a girl,

16:05.665 --> 16:08.635
David, then she's not
good enough for you.

16:08.735 --> 16:12.372
Hey, did you see the way
I switched sides there?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.307
[phone rings]

16:17.277 --> 16:18.411
Hello.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.047
Yeah, hi Bonnie.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.348
I'm not talking to her.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.449
Oh, grow up.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.517
What's going on?

16:24.617 --> 16:26.853
Yeah?

16:26.953 --> 16:28.455
Oh my god.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.157
No.
Yeah, I will.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.124
I'll tell her.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.625
OK, thanks for calling.

16:32.725 --> 16:33.793
Bye.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.095
What did she say?

16:35.195 --> 16:37.830
Well, Crystal
just had a baby girl

16:37.930 --> 16:41.168
and we missed it,
because you're an idiot.

16:41.268 --> 16:42.769
She called me an idiot?

16:58.951 --> 16:59.752
Hey.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.987
Hey, Dan.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.323
Kids all want to
come in and say hi.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.659
In a minute, OK?

17:06.759 --> 17:08.795
My little sister is
in the nursery now.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.130
Is she OK?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.332
Well, they got her in
one of them incubator deals

17:12.432 --> 17:13.766
to keep her warm,
but she's great.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.302
You think she's pretty?

17:15.402 --> 17:17.437
Oh, she's beautiful.

17:17.537 --> 17:21.074
You know, if you
like bald chicks.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.177
Dan, thanks for
hanging in there

17:24.277 --> 17:27.547
and for doing all that
stuff around my house.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.450
And for just putting up with me.

17:30.550 --> 17:34.121
I'm family, Crystal,
I was happy to do it.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.923
But, you know, watching
you push the baby out,

17:37.023 --> 17:38.158
for that I gotta charge ya.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.593
Oh.

17:40.693 --> 17:41.561
Hi.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.062
CRYSTAL: Oh, hey.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.965
Oh, Crystal, I'm so sorry.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.567
What happened to you?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.636
Oh, never mind.

17:49.736 --> 17:54.073
It's a really long story
and I come off bad in it.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.575
So how are you doing?

17:55.675 --> 17:58.978
Oh, I'm tired and I'm happy.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.880
Well, since we couldn't
get a hold of you,

18:00.980 --> 18:02.649
Dan was the birth
coach and he was great.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.983
Ah, couldn't have
done it without you.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.019
Aw, you got your
little baby girl.

18:07.120 --> 18:07.920
You happy?

18:08.020 --> 18:09.021
Oh, yeah.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.390
I just know raising
a daughter is

18:10.490 --> 18:12.292
going to be one of the
most wonderful experiences

18:12.392 --> 18:13.226
of my life.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.562
She must've lost
a lot of blood.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.367
Can I come in?

18:20.467 --> 18:21.268
Oh, hi honey.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.335
Where's your baby brother?

18:22.435 --> 18:23.770
Out in the waiting
room with DJ.

18:23.870 --> 18:27.507
Can I have a moment so I can
apologize to my wonderful son

18:27.607 --> 18:30.810
for being so patient
while I was a crazy lady?

18:30.910 --> 18:31.778
Sure.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.180
Let's go make faces
at the babies.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.717
Listen, she's
feeling really guilty

18:37.817 --> 18:38.851
and vulnerable right now.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.422
So you could definitely
get a moped out of this.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.258
Hey, way to go.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.359
Oh, you know.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.328
Breathe, push, breathe,
push, no big deal.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.030
But you always look
so cute in these scrubs.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.267
You guys ever think
about having another one?

18:54.367 --> 18:55.702
Well what do you
say, Dan, it might

18:55.802 --> 18:56.936
be fun to have one on purpose?

18:59.939 --> 19:01.140
Am I interrupting?

19:01.241 --> 19:02.475
Yes, please.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.411
I had to stay and
close up the restaurant.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.345
How's Crystal and the baby?

19:05.445 --> 19:06.379
Everybody's fine.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.514
Lonnie is in there
talking to Crystal.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.048
Give them a couple of minutes.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.517
And then, Dan, let's go.

19:10.617 --> 19:11.484
Where we going?

19:11.584 --> 19:12.685
Well, these two
had a fight and now

19:12.785 --> 19:13.586
they're going to make up.

19:13.686 --> 19:14.521
What happened?

19:14.621 --> 19:16.389
Well, you know,
your wife, how she

19:16.489 --> 19:17.890
can be a big baby sometimes.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.393
Yes.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.830
So, don't let that stop
you from apologizing.

19:23.930 --> 19:27.834
Well, I admit maybe a
couple of things that I said

19:27.934 --> 19:28.968
might've come out wrong.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.070
And?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.171
And that's it.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.044
Apology accepted.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.747
And?

19:40.847 --> 19:42.682
Well, I hate
fighting with you,

19:42.782 --> 19:44.417
you know, because
after Jackie, and now

19:44.517 --> 19:46.919
that Crystal's back
to being herself,

19:47.019 --> 19:48.655
well, you're like my
third best friend.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.659
Tied with Nancy and Annemarie.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.395
Apology accepted.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.264
So, did you get the job.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.197
No.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.166
Well, who'd they give it to?

20:00.267 --> 20:02.168
Nobody.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.404
They're closing
down the restaurant.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.772
What?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.274
Yeah, like in
three weeks they're

20:07.374 --> 20:10.743
going to turn the whole
place into a Bargain Bin.

20:10.843 --> 20:14.180
Damn.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.615
Yeah.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.650
And ain't like there's a whole
lot out there for a couple

20:17.750 --> 20:20.920
of career gals like us.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.456
I got like two
mortgages on my house.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.169
Well, let's go look
at that new baby.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.070
Yeah.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.566
So, you wanna come in?

21:06.666 --> 21:08.067
No.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.169
You need your space,
and if I came in I'd

21:10.269 --> 21:12.004
just be crowding you.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.440
Oh, OK.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.549
And I need my space, too.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.117
So Monday after
school I'm just going

21:25.217 --> 21:26.486
to hang out with my friends.

21:26.586 --> 21:27.720
Oh, that's great.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.629
You have to admit that,
you know, making out

21:36.729 --> 21:38.798
is a lot better after you
take a couple days break.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.500
Definitely.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.569
Our lips healed.
