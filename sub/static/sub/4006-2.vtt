RANDALL NOW CLAIMS TO HAVE
EVIDENCE ON THREE OTHER MURDERS

13:37.875 --> 13:39.542

13:39.542 --> 13:41.000

THAT'S NICE OF HIM.

13:44.959 --> 13:46.959

TO CLEAR HIS CONSCIENCE.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.583
I THINK HIS LAWYERS ARE JUST
TRYING TO SWING A DEAL.

NOT COMPLETELY FULL OF SHIT.

ONE DETECTIVE AND ONE LAB TECH

14:03.625 --> 14:05.250

THE SCENE.

14:55.125 --> 14:58.458
EVERY ALTERNATIVE

40:42.709 --> 40:44.083
TO FIND VIKTOR.

40:44.083 --> 40:46.250
- YEAH, I SWEAR.

40:46.250 --> 40:50.166
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW THEY GOT HIS NAME.

40:50.166 --> 40:52.875
- I'M SURE OF IT.

40:52.875 --> 40:54.542
BUT WE'LL GET TO THAT.

40:57.583 --> 41:00.125
- ANYWAY, I THOUGHT
HE WAS IN KIEV WITH YOU.

41:00.125 --> 41:06.125
- IF VIKTOR WAS IN KIEV,
WHY WOULD I BE HERE?

41:06.125 --> 41:08.250
VIKTOR NEVER MADE HIS FLIGHT.

41:08.250 --> 41:09.959
I CHECKED.

41:09.959 --> 41:11.959
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

41:11.959 --> 41:15.583
WHERE IS HE, THEN?

41:18.709 --> 41:21.291
- VIKTOR'S CAUSED US
SOME PROBLEMS.

41:21.291 --> 41:23.959
I WON'T DENY IT.

41:23.959 --> 41:27.458
[laughs] SHOOTING A POLICEMAN
IS NEVER GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

41:30.333 --> 41:32.959
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER

41:32.959 --> 41:35.125
IF SOMEONE IN THE BROTHERHOOD

41:35.125 --> 41:38.875
DECIDED TO MAKE
AN EXAMPLE OF HIM.

41:38.875 --> 41:40.375
- WITHOUT YOUR APPROVAL?

41:40.375 --> 41:43.458
NO, NO, NO.

41:43.458 --> 41:45.417
VIKTOR WAS IMPULSIVE, YES.

41:45.417 --> 41:48.208
HE DID A STUPID THING, YES.

41:48.208 --> 41:50.333
BUT HE WAS ONE OF US.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.792
AND WE WOULD
ALWAYS PROTECT HIM.

42:01.417 --> 42:03.750
- YOU'RE IN LUCK.

42:03.750 --> 42:06.792
- WHY?

42:06.792 --> 42:09.667
- I BELIEVE YOU.

42:13.041 --> 42:16.166
I'VE HAD A LONG FLIGHT.

42:16.166 --> 42:18.166
[speaking Russian]

42:20.291 --> 42:24.625
WE HAVE A LOT TO DISCUSS.

42:25.875 --> 42:28.125
[cell phone rings]

42:28.125 --> 42:29.500
- HELLO?
- HELLO, JOEY?

42:29.500 --> 42:31.709
IT'S NADIA FROM THE FOX HOLE.

42:31.709 --> 42:35.208
- YEAH, HOW MANY NADIAS
DO YOU THINK I KNOW?

42:35.208 --> 42:37.875
WHAT'S UP?
- MY CAR WON'T START.

42:37.875 --> 42:40.709
I WAS WONDERING
IF MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE ME

42:40.709 --> 42:42.667
A RIDE HOME TONIGHT.

42:42.667 --> 42:45.834
- YEAH, SURE.
WHAT TIME DO YOU GET OFF?

43:44.583 --> 43:47.125
- HEY, WE WERE JUST HAVING
A LITTLE DINNER.

43:47.125 --> 43:48.959
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

43:48.959 --> 43:50.500
- HEY, BUD,
I MISSED YOU TODAY.

43:50.500 --> 43:52.959
HOW WAS SCHOOL?
- WE HAD TOY SHARE.

43:52.959 --> 43:55.041
- TOY SHARE?
- MM-HMM.

43:55.041 --> 43:57.125
- DID YOU BRING
YOUR TRAIN SET?

43:57.125 --> 43:58.959
- FIRE TRUCK.

43:58.959 --> 44:01.750
- FIRE TRUCK
BEAT OUT THE TRAIN SET?

44:01.750 --> 44:02.834
- YES.

44:02.834 --> 44:06.166
- OH, HEY, DEX.

44:06.166 --> 44:08.041
JUST GRABBING ONE FOR THE ROAD.

44:08.041 --> 44:09.667
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME
BEING ON THIS SIDE ALONE,

44:09.667 --> 44:12.417
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT
WHEN JAMIE'S HERE, RIGHT?

44:14.291 --> 44:16.083
- WHY NOT?

44:16.083 --> 44:17.333
- SWEET.

44:17.333 --> 44:19.125
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT PLACE
TO HANG OUT.

44:19.125 --> 44:20.709
RIGHT BY THE BAY.

44:20.709 --> 44:22.417
- YEAH.
- I LOVE COMING OVER HERE.

44:22.417 --> 44:24.625
- MM-HMM.

44:24.625 --> 44:26.333
- WELL, I BETTER GET GOING.

44:26.333 --> 44:28.834
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

44:37.375 --> 44:40.125
- I'LL CATCH YOU AT WORK,
RIGHT?

44:49.750 --> 44:53.125
- HE'S NOT SCARED OF ME
AT ALL.

44:53.125 --> 44:58.875
AND HE'S NOT GOING TO QUIT
UNLESS I STOP HIM.

45:01.041 --> 45:03.709
- YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

45:03.709 --> 45:05.917
NOT ALL COPS
ARE SO NICE TO STRIPPERS.

45:05.917 --> 45:07.750
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

45:07.750 --> 45:10.250
I WAS HOPING YOU HAD SOMETHING
MORE FOR ME.

45:10.250 --> 45:12.166
- MORE FOR YOU?

45:12.166 --> 45:13.792
- ABOUT THE MURDERS.

45:13.792 --> 45:15.875
- [scoffs]
WHAT? YOU THINK THIS IS

45:15.875 --> 45:21.875
JUST SOME PLOY SO I CAN GET YOU
ALONE AND SPILL MY GUTS?

45:23.625 --> 45:25.834
LOOK, I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
THAT I KNEW.

45:25.834 --> 45:28.000
MY CAR REALLY DID BREAK DOWN.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.875
SORRY. IF YOU WANT,
I COULD PAY YOU FOR THE GAS.

45:31.875 --> 45:34.417
- STOP IT. IT'S FINE.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO

45:34.417 --> 45:37.041
AFTER ALL I'M COSTING YOU
IN TIPS.

45:37.041 --> 45:40.041
- YOU'LL HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE
THAN GIVE ME A LIFT

45:40.041 --> 45:41.333
TO MAKE UP FOR THAT.

45:43.542 --> 45:45.875
THIS IS IT.
ON THE LEFT.

45:48.625 --> 45:52.625
- WHAT'D YOU HAVE IN MIND
AS FAR AS COMPENSATION?

45:52.625 --> 45:56.041
- I DON'T KNOW.
USE YOUR IMAGINATION.

45:56.041 --> 45:57.917
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GIVE ME A HINT.

45:57.917 --> 46:00.792
I'M VERY UNIMAGINATIVE.

46:02.250 --> 46:03.375
- OKAY.

46:05.250 --> 46:09.208
GEORGE SAYS THE PROBLEM WITH MY
CAR COULD BE THE TRANSMISSION.

46:09.208 --> 46:10.834
- MM-HMM.

46:10.834 --> 46:15.083
- IT MEANS IT'S GOING
TO BE IN THE SHOP

46:15.083 --> 46:17.083
FOR AT LEAST A FEW DAYS.

46:17.083 --> 46:18.834
- YEAH.

46:18.834 --> 46:24.208
- WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD
PICK UP THE BILL.

46:24.208 --> 46:26.542
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

46:36.458 --> 46:39.709
- YOU'RE AWFULLY QUIET TONIGHT.

46:39.709 --> 46:41.875
ANYTHING YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT?

46:41.875 --> 46:44.750
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

46:46.125 --> 46:47.792
- YEAH.

46:47.792 --> 46:50.125
- WHAT?

46:50.125 --> 46:51.834
- DO YOU HAVE ANY A.1.?

46:54.291 --> 46:56.417
- I THINK SO.

46:57.875 --> 47:00.458
- JUST ENOUGH
FOR A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

47:00.458 --> 47:04.125
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

47:04.125 --> 47:06.333
- SUCCESS!

47:06.333 --> 47:08.834
- THANK YOU.

47:23.250 --> 47:24.959
[keys clattering]

47:32.792 --> 47:35.875
JUST FINISHING
WHAT YOU STARTED.

47:55.625 --> 47:58.917
- [sighs]
I PROMISED DEB.

48:00.709 --> 48:05.375
[cell phone ringing
distantly]

48:05.375 --> 48:09.000
[ringing grows louder]

48:16.166 --> 48:18.208
- HELLO?

48:22.375 --> 48:24.041
WHERE ARE YOU?

48:29.041 --> 48:30.667
- SORRY.

48:30.667 --> 48:32.667
I GOT HERE AS FAST AS I COULD.

48:32.667 --> 48:37.166
I ALMOST DROVE OFF THE ROAD.
I'M SO FUCKING TIRED.

48:37.166 --> 48:41.041
[sighs]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

48:43.083 --> 48:46.917
- I SNUCK OUT OF THE HOUSE
WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP.

48:46.917 --> 48:48.625
- DEXTER, WHAT THE FUCK
DID YOU DO?

48:48.625 --> 48:53.083
- NOTHING.
[laughs]

48:53.083 --> 48:56.333
I COULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT,
BUT I WANTED TO.

48:56.333 --> 48:57.917
I NEEDED TO.

48:57.917 --> 49:01.250
I DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

49:01.250 --> 49:05.417
I LOST CONTROL.
ALL I COULD SEE WAS BLOOD.

49:05.417 --> 49:07.542
ALL I COULD FEEL
WAS THE PRESSURE...

49:07.542 --> 49:09.709
[sniffles]
IN MY HEAD.

49:09.709 --> 49:12.792
FUCK.

49:15.166 --> 49:17.000
IT IS TOO DEEP
INSIDE ME.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.625
HARRY WAS RIGHT.
I AM A MONSTER.

49:23.959 --> 49:27.125
YOU SHOULD ARREST ME.
YOU SHOULD TAKE ME IN.

49:27.125 --> 49:29.625
GET ME OFF THE STREET.

49:29.625 --> 49:34.250
- DEX, DAD WAS WRONG.

49:36.834 --> 49:41.625
THE FACT THAT WE'RE HERE TONIGHT
PROVES THAT YOU ARE IN CONTROL.

49:41.625 --> 49:44.166
- BUT I WASN'T.
- BUT YOU STOPPED.

49:44.166 --> 49:46.959
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

49:46.959 --> 49:49.792
IT MUST'VE BEEN SO HARD FOR YOU
TO CALL ME,

49:49.792 --> 49:53.083
BUT YOU DID,
AND THAT'S A HUGE STEP.

49:55.875 --> 49:59.625
IT MAKES ME THINK
MAYBE YOU CAN CONTROL THIS.

49:59.625 --> 50:01.959
- YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

50:01.959 --> 50:04.667
- I DIDN'T,

50:04.667 --> 50:07.834
BUT MAYBE NOW I DO.

50:12.333 --> 50:14.834
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT
IS A GOOD THING.

50:14.834 --> 50:17.792
IT WAS REALLY,
REALLY GOOD.

50:19.500 --> 50:22.458
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP,

50:22.458 --> 50:25.834
AND I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU GIVE UP.

50:30.625 --> 50:32.834
- ARE YOU OKAY TO DRIVE?

50:32.834 --> 50:34.166
- NO, I'M GONNA STAY WITH YOU.

50:34.166 --> 50:38.667
- I JUST NEED TO BE ALONE
FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

50:38.667 --> 50:41.458
NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN.

50:41.458 --> 50:44.500
- OKAY.

50:52.583 --> 50:55.000
[engine turns]

51:11.000 --> 51:13.208
- YOU'LL WAKE UP
WITH A HEADACHE,

51:13.208 --> 51:16.250
PROBABLY HAVE A DECENT IDEA
HOW YOU GOT HERE.

51:16.250 --> 51:18.333
MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING.

51:30.250 --> 51:33.709
I STILL HAVE TO GET YOU
OUT OF MY LIFE.

51:33.709 --> 51:36.208
BUT NOT BY TAKING YOURS.

51:57.125 --> 51:59.625
- WHAT THE FUCK?

52:01.083 --> 52:03.917
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?
- I'M YOUR EMPLOYER--

52:03.917 --> 52:06.291
OR RATHER, FORMER EMPLOYER.

52:06.291 --> 52:09.083
I BELIEVE
YOU RECENTLY GAVE NOTICE.

52:09.083 --> 52:11.458
- BULLSHIT.
I WORK FOR GEORGE.

52:11.458 --> 52:13.625
WELL, WORKED.
- AND HE WORKS FOR ME.

52:13.625 --> 52:15.875
MY NAME IS ISAAK.

52:15.875 --> 52:18.417
I'M THE OWNER OF THE FOX HOLE
CHAIN OF GENTLEMEN'S CLUBS,

52:18.417 --> 52:20.625
AMONGST OTHER ENTERPRISES.

52:20.625 --> 52:22.291
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

52:22.291 --> 52:24.709
- WELL, IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT GEORGE NEGLECTED

52:24.709 --> 52:26.458
TO DO YOUR EXIT INTERVIEW.

52:26.458 --> 52:27.917
IT'S COMPANY POLICY,

52:27.917 --> 52:29.709
AND I'M A STICKLER
WHEN IT COMES TO RULES.

52:29.709 --> 52:32.208
- [chuckles] YOU GOT--
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING, RIGHT?

52:32.208 --> 52:34.125
- KEEPING GOOD EMPLOYEES
IS ESSENTIAL

52:34.125 --> 52:35.792
TO RUNNING
A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.

52:35.792 --> 52:38.125
YOUR FEEDBACK IS IMPORTANT.

52:38.125 --> 52:40.208
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHY YOU QUIT?

52:40.208 --> 52:43.959
WELL, I TRUST IT WASN'T
THE HOSTILE WORKING ENVIRONMENT.

52:43.959 --> 52:46.750
- NO, I, UM...
[clears throat]

52:46.750 --> 52:50.291
I JUST FELT
IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON.

52:50.291 --> 52:52.041
- SO IT WAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE TRAGIC DEATH

52:52.041 --> 52:54.000
OF ONE OF OUR DANCERS?

52:54.000 --> 52:55.917
KAJA, I BELIEVE HER NAME WAS.

52:55.917 --> 52:59.875
BECAUSE IF IT DID,
I WOULD COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

52:59.875 --> 53:02.500
IT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE
A TRAUMATIC LOSS FOR YOU.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

53:04.125 --> 53:07.291
- MAYBE THAT'S WHY
YOU TALKED TO THE POLICE.

53:07.291 --> 53:08.542
- NO WAY.

53:08.542 --> 53:11.500
- I HAD YOU FOLLOWED.

53:11.500 --> 53:14.291
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

53:14.291 --> 53:15.291
I SWEAR.

53:15.291 --> 53:16.834
- I LIED.

53:16.834 --> 53:19.208
I DIDN'T HAVE YOU FOLLOWED.

53:19.208 --> 53:21.792
YOU WERE JUST
THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE.

53:25.500 --> 53:28.750
YOU LOVED HER, DIDN'T YOU?
- WHAT?

53:28.750 --> 53:30.542
- KAJA.

53:30.542 --> 53:33.208
YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH HER.

53:33.208 --> 53:36.041
IT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

53:36.041 --> 53:40.250
IT'S THE ONE THING THAT GIVES
MEANING IN THIS LIFE.

53:42.417 --> 53:46.500
I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING
IF I WAS IN YOUR POSITION.

53:49.125 --> 53:52.417
IT'S TERRIBLE TO LOSE SOMEONE
YOU LOVE.

53:55.542 --> 53:57.208
- [grunts]

54:24.500 --> 54:28.166
- YOU STILL THINKING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

54:28.166 --> 54:29.417
- ACTUALLY,
I'M THINKING ABOUT

54:29.417 --> 54:31.500
HOW MUCH I COULD GO
FOR A FROSTY SWIRL.

54:31.500 --> 54:33.625
- THAT'S GOOD.

54:33.625 --> 54:36.792
- A SUDDEN CRAVING FOR SUGAR
IS GOOD?

54:36.792 --> 54:39.834
- WELL, IF YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT NORMAL THINGS,

54:39.834 --> 54:42.959
THEN MAYBE YOU'RE BECOMING
MORE NORMAL.

54:42.959 --> 54:46.542
- I'M NEVER GOING TO BE NORMAL,
DEB.

54:46.542 --> 54:48.792
- YEAH.

54:48.792 --> 54:50.709
NONE OF US REALLY ARE.

54:52.875 --> 54:54.583
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

54:54.583 --> 54:58.500
- I WANT A FROSTY SWIRL.
I'LL BRING YOU ONE.

54:58.500 --> 55:02.500
- SHE'LL ALWAYS BE WATCHING ME.
BUT MAYBE THAT'S OKAY.

55:02.500 --> 55:05.500
IF WAYNE RANDALL CAN MAKE PEACE
WITH HIS SENTENCE,

55:05.500 --> 55:06.959
WHO AM I TO COMPLAIN?

55:06.959 --> 55:10.166
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
THE ALTERNATIVE.

55:10.166 --> 55:11.583
- WELL, WELL.

55:11.583 --> 55:15.291
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO ARE READY
TO EAT EACH OTHER'S SHIT.

55:15.291 --> 55:18.333
- OH, YEAH.
WE KIND OF PATCHED THINGS UP.

55:20.834 --> 55:22.375
- I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

55:22.375 --> 55:27.333
I NEVER GOT TO DO THAT
WITH HANNAH.

55:27.333 --> 55:30.417
ROBIN TO MY BATMAN.

55:32.542 --> 55:36.625
I WAS NEVER AS ALIVE
AS I WAS WHEN I WAS WITH HER.

55:36.625 --> 55:39.959
EVERY DAY WAS LIKE

55:39.959 --> 55:43.166
CHRISTMAS DAY--

55:43.166 --> 55:44.625
UNWRAPPED PRESENT.

55:46.792 --> 55:50.500
I WISH I HAD A CHANCE
TO TELL HER HOW I FELT.

55:50.500 --> 55:54.166
- YOU CAN STILL TELL HER.

55:54.166 --> 55:56.333
- YEAH.

55:56.333 --> 55:58.792
I'M AFRAID THE CLOCK
HAS RUN OUT.

56:04.250 --> 56:10.291
DAMN, I SURE AS FUCK...

56:10.291 --> 56:12.500
GONNA MISS THAT.

56:14.667 --> 56:20.291
HANNAH USED TO THINK
I WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL.

56:20.291 --> 56:23.375
NOW SHE SEES ME
AS JUST A KILLER.

56:25.875 --> 56:28.417
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

56:28.417 --> 56:32.000
SHE'S NOT WRONG.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.417
THERE'S JUST ONE LAST PERSON
I NEED TO KILL.

56:39.583 --> 56:42.041
[horn honking]

56:42.041 --> 56:47.417
[brakes screeching]

57:15.583 --> 57:18.959
- HE NEVER CARED
IF ANYONE FOUND THE BODIES.

57:18.959 --> 57:24.208

57:27.083 --> 57:30.041
AND HE COULDN'T TAKE LIFE
IN PRISON.

57:33.333 --> 57:36.125
CAN I?
