Fernando. Nice robe.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.404
Why are you making breakfast?

01:11.488 --> 01:13.323
[Spanish accent]
Just my little thank you

01:13.406 --> 01:15.366
for letting me stay at your home
for a few months.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.493
-Days.
-Months.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.869
-Weeks.
-Years.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.829
-Months.
-Deal.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.123
Wait, what just happened? [sighs]

01:25.001 --> 01:26.711
Fernando, you took my robe.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.383
I thought we could trade.
I like a fresh breeze in the morning.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.595
-Good morning.
-Good morning, everyone.

01:35.678 --> 01:36.596
Morning.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.973
So how was the sleepover, girls?

01:39.057 --> 01:42.602
-Best sleepover ever!
-We didn't fall asleep once!

01:42.685 --> 01:44.187
[girls squeak with excitement]

01:44.771 --> 01:48.942
Hola, Fuller-itos, Tanner-itos,
Fernando-ritos.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.236
Now I want Doritos.

01:52.904 --> 01:57.617
Hey, uh, Jimmy, I noticed your beat up RV
is still in front of our house.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.744
Just how long
are you gonna be parked here?

01:59.828 --> 02:04.290
That's up to Steph. All I know
is that my heart is parked here forever.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.292
[all three] Aww.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.628
No, "Awws", OK? This is not happening.

02:08.711 --> 02:12.507
I got you a gift. It's my dream catcher.
I don't need it anymore.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.343
All my dreams came true
that day we had our first kiss.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.762
[all three] Aww!

02:17.846 --> 02:19.556
Stop with the "Awws".

02:20.890 --> 02:22.517
[whispers] Can we go out, please?

02:25.562 --> 02:29.399
You know, half of me wants to say,
"No, thank you,"

02:29.482 --> 02:32.318
and the other half of me
also wants to say, "No, thank you."

02:33.444 --> 02:35.113
How about the third half?

02:37.323 --> 02:39.784
Well, the third half wants you
to get a math tutor.

02:40.493 --> 02:44.289
Well, all the math I need to know
is that you plus me equals happiness.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.915
[all three] Aww!

02:46.499 --> 02:51.296
Oh, I say go for it. Jimmy Gibbler
is so sweet and thoughtful.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.631
Yeah, he's really
the black sheep of the family.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.015
I have an announcement
about my school project.

03:02.098 --> 03:04.559
To show that one kid
can make a difference,

03:04.642 --> 03:09.188
I'm going to save our natural resources
and respect our animal friends

03:09.272 --> 03:11.691
by becoming a vegetarian,
starting right now.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.862
Ooh, bacon!

03:22.076 --> 03:24.454
Max, you do know
bacon comes from pigs?

03:24.537 --> 03:27.957
I don't mean to embarrass you,
but I believe you're thinking of ham.

03:31.419 --> 03:35.506
Kimberlina is always right.
Bacon comes from pigs.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.926
I'm afraid it's true.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.846
Well, then, I guess it's goodbye bacon.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.350
Sorry, old pal.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.644
It's not you, it's me.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.567
Good luck. No one can resist my bacon.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.862
Oh! A penny.

04:03.701 --> 04:07.247
Hey, sports fans, gotta carbo-load
before practice. Coach's orders.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.208
Oh. Why are you dressed up
like a football player?

04:10.291 --> 04:13.711
Because I tried out for the team,
and guess what? I made it!

04:13.795 --> 04:15.129
Ta-da!

04:15.213 --> 04:16.631
I mean, boo-ya!

04:17.131 --> 04:19.968
Yeah, hit it right there.
Yeah, Tommy, let's go, OK...

04:22.637 --> 04:26.391
So, Lola, I guess you'll be
cheering for me on the old griddle iron?

04:26.474 --> 04:29.269
I think the term is "Gridiron."

04:29.769 --> 04:32.897
Whatevs. Just as long as you're
cheering for me from the balcony.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.568
-You mean the stands?
-Whatevs.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.487
Jackson.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.533
Why didn't you tell me
about wanting to play football?

04:43.616 --> 04:46.744
Because you'd get all freaked out
and then pretend it's fine,

04:46.828 --> 04:48.037
and then yell at me for it.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.790
I wouldn't get all freaked out.

04:50.873 --> 04:51.958
And I am fine.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.003
[yells] Why wouldn't you ask me for...
Oh, OK, I see what I did there.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.924
Don't worry, Mom. I'll see you
after rehearsal. I mean practice.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.970
[makes manly emphatic grunts]

05:04.762 --> 05:07.890
OK, maybe I am being
a little overprotective.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.269
I mean, what are the odds that
anything bad will happen to Jackson?

05:11.352 --> 05:14.314
You mean the kid who twisted
his ankle getting the mail?

05:15.231 --> 05:18.151
You mean the kid who sprained
his arm making his bed?

05:20.361 --> 05:22.488
I saw him trip on confetti once.

05:28.578 --> 05:32.040
OK, Charlie, your ear infection
is all cleared up.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.459
Aww.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.045
Well, that is so sweet.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.338
But I'm still gonna have to bill you.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.842
Bye, Charlie.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.182
Phew! Frenchie's worm-free.
I'm ready for lunch.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.686
-Hey, I, uh, I have a question for you.
-Hmm?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.730
Jackson made the football team.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.608
But I'm really worried
about how dangerous it is.

05:58.691 --> 06:02.570
Ah, well, you should be worried. I played
college ball and blew out both knees.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.447
So you're against Jackson playing?

06:04.530 --> 06:07.617
Heck no! Football was
the greatest time of my life.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.080
So then you're for Jackson playing.

06:12.163 --> 06:15.166
I didn't say that.
My whole body hurts every time it rains.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.378
So you're for it and against it?

06:19.462 --> 06:20.505
Exactly.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.841
-Lunch is here!
-[Matt] Oh!

06:23.925 --> 06:25.093
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.178
-DJ!
-Hi!

06:28.054 --> 06:32.391
Salad shakes. Every nutrient you need
with no fat, no sugar--

06:32.475 --> 06:33.851
And no taste!

06:36.104 --> 06:39.816
Oh, hey, um... Can I bring Crystal
to game night tonight?

06:39.899 --> 06:42.735
I already invited her,
but I wanted to run it by you first.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.029
So... is that cool?

06:45.738 --> 06:49.200
Well, you already invited her
and she's standing right here, so...

06:50.326 --> 06:52.495
it'd be pretty darn awkward
if I said "No."

06:54.038 --> 06:54.956
Great.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.208
Oh, and I also invited
Steve and his girlfriend CJ

06:57.291 --> 06:58.751
and they're definitely coming,

06:58.835 --> 07:00.670
but I told them I wanted to
run it by you first.

07:02.755 --> 07:03.714
Can they come too?

07:03.798 --> 07:08.469
Well, if they are definitely coming,
then they can definitely come!

07:10.221 --> 07:11.973
You are so sweet.

07:12.056 --> 07:15.059
How on Earth are you still single?

07:16.436 --> 07:19.856
I know. It is baffling!

07:22.483 --> 07:24.652
Well, you're not alone. You've got us.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.821
Hashtag BFFs.

07:26.904 --> 07:29.615
[laughs awkwardly] Hashtag third wheel.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.540
[straining] Six... [sighs]

07:37.623 --> 07:40.126
Seven...
Hey, Mom, get in here and spot me.

07:41.127 --> 07:41.961
Eight...

07:43.337 --> 07:46.048
Nine... Take him, Mom. Mom, take him, Mom!

07:46.132 --> 07:47.800
[sighs]

07:49.177 --> 07:52.054
Jackson, I've been doing
some thinking and...

07:52.638 --> 07:54.515
after careful consideration,

07:54.599 --> 07:56.517
I have to say no to you playing football.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.269
What? But you already said yes.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.646
Well, technically, I just didn't say no.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.233
And, even more technically,
you joined the team without asking me.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.444
[sighs] Because I knew you would do this!

08:06.527 --> 08:07.945
You're always babying me.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.239
I'm 13 now. [voice cracks] I'm a man.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.664
Let's not argue in front of Tommy.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.668
Here, kid. Fetch.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.552
Come on, Mom. Dad played football.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.515
Well, you're dad had...
more of a football body.

08:38.434 --> 08:42.021
You have more of a... a ping pong body.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.860
He still would've let me play.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.948
Well, maybe he would have, but parents
have a lot more information today,

08:52.031 --> 08:53.491
especially about concussions.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.494
But I could get hurt
just walking on the street.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.954
And I do!

09:02.458 --> 09:05.753
You know what? These are the last words
you will ever hear from me.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.296
Goodbye, Mother.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.303
[muffled struggling]

09:16.764 --> 09:19.267
[shouts] If you're still there,
I could use a little help.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.230
Hello?

09:24.313 --> 09:25.856
Is anybody there?

09:31.112 --> 09:32.363
[doorbell rings]

09:34.448 --> 09:35.366
Hey, Jimmy.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.704
Why ring the doorbell
if you're gonna just walk in anyway?

09:40.246 --> 09:42.123
Just like pressing buttons.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.335
Kimmy told me you needed
a partner for game night.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.378
Kimmy?

09:49.255 --> 09:52.675
I've been thinking about you and Jimmy,
and if you guys really hit it off,

09:52.758 --> 09:55.720
you could become Mrs. Stephanie Gibbler!

09:58.889 --> 10:01.726
And then you wouldn't just be
DJ's annoying little sister,

10:01.809 --> 10:04.270
you'd be my annoying little sister too!

10:05.563 --> 10:07.106
How fun would that be?

10:08.441 --> 10:09.275
[sighs]

10:09.358 --> 10:10.276
[grunts]

10:11.110 --> 10:12.069
[doorbell rings]

10:13.321 --> 10:15.031
All right, I'm ready for game night.

10:15.114 --> 10:18.409
The baby's taking a nap,
Jackson's trying to get his shirt off.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.954
I'll help him when we're done.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.415
-Hey, Deej.
-Hi!

10:24.498 --> 10:27.001
-You remember Ceej?
-Hi, Deej.

10:27.084 --> 10:28.085
Hi, Ceej.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.629
[CJ laughs] Ooh.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.299
Now I went ahead
and pre-cut some category slips

10:33.382 --> 10:34.842
for when we play "Celebrity".

10:34.925 --> 10:36.761
Oh! So did I.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.765
Great! I also made up
score cards for the teams.

10:40.848 --> 10:41.891
Oh, so did I!

10:43.225 --> 10:44.435
And I laminated them.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.520
Me too!

10:48.189 --> 10:50.107
I still can't get over how alike you are.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.817
We really are!

10:52.860 --> 10:53.778
I don't see it.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.657
-Hey, guys.
-[Crystal] DJ!

10:57.740 --> 11:00.159
-Hey.
-I brought you a date.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.328
Because I feel so bad
that you're all alone.

11:02.870 --> 11:03.746
Come on in!

11:12.505 --> 11:13.589
Mike here.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.050
You must be DJ.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.009
Hello.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.553
Nice getaway sticks.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.849
So you're a pet doctor?

11:23.933 --> 11:26.769
At least that's what the Google says.
[laughs]

11:29.063 --> 11:30.481
Isn't Pops a hoot?

11:31.482 --> 11:33.234
Did you just say "Pops"?

11:34.026 --> 11:35.027
Is this your dad?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.195
No!

11:36.278 --> 11:38.072
Oh. [laughs nervously]

11:38.155 --> 11:39.240
Thank goodness!

11:39.323 --> 11:41.325
No, I'm her granddad.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.876
You know, I was gonna
bow out of game night.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.086
Not anymore.

11:55.881 --> 11:56.882
-[whispers] Hey!
-Mmm?

11:56.966 --> 11:58.092
Did you know about this?

11:58.175 --> 11:59.844
Not until Pops got in the car.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.388
But I am curious to see
how this is going to play out.

12:04.723 --> 12:07.893
Deej! You and Mike
have so much in common!

12:07.977 --> 12:12.148
I mean, you have three kids,
and he has three grandkids.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.317
And age is just a number.

12:16.944 --> 12:17.987
Mike here.

12:19.196 --> 12:22.116
If you're wondering, my number is 72.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.702
But not under the hood.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.662
Vroom-vroom.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.707
[cackles]

12:31.667 --> 12:34.795
Oh! I'm sorry. You just got vroomed.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.422
[cackles]

12:39.383 --> 12:41.552
He's a duck who sells insurance.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.137
Aflac. Ben Affleck!

12:43.220 --> 12:44.346
[both cheer]

12:44.430 --> 12:45.389
Yeah!

12:45.473 --> 12:46.807
-Great guess!
-Great clue!

12:49.810 --> 12:51.979
You know, you guys still have more time.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.567
Oh, to be young and in love.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.154
Remember those days, DJ?

13:01.197 --> 13:03.073
Like they were yesterday.

13:04.533 --> 13:05.659
Because they were.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.747
Uh, time. Matt, Crystal, you're up.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.040
All right. Let's do it.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.710
-You ready?
-All right.

13:14.793 --> 13:15.628
OK.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.924
[deep voice] "I pity the fool"--

13:20.007 --> 13:21.592
-Mr T!
-Yes!

13:23.302 --> 13:26.514
Don't mind me.
Just passing through very carefully.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.689
In case you're wondering
about the bubble wrap,

13:35.773 --> 13:38.442
I've been told that I have
a very fragile "ping pong" body.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.322
Oh. Stairs. Too dangerous.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.199
Better go sleep in the kitchen.

13:48.786 --> 13:49.662
Teenagers.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.955
Mike here.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.292
You know what that kid needs? Football.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.710
[manly grunt]

13:56.794 --> 13:57.878
Toughen him up.

13:59.421 --> 14:02.883
All right, Mike. I have never lost
a game night, so let's bring it.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.134
Mike here.

14:06.136 --> 14:09.390
You're a spunky little chicken
and I'm all right with that.

14:13.060 --> 14:13.894
OK.

14:14.770 --> 14:17.189
-This actor won an Oscar--
-Douglas Fairbanks.

14:18.774 --> 14:19.859
No. He was in--

14:19.942 --> 14:22.319
-Charlton Heston.
-No, let me give you--

14:22.403 --> 14:23.487
Dick Van Dyke.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.991
-He was--
-Jerry Van Dyke.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.368
Tom and Jerry.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.914
No, those aren't actors.
Those are cartoon crows.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.166
No, that's Heckle and Jeckle.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.168
I thought you said you were good at this.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.086
What?

14:39.169 --> 14:40.838
[laughs uncontrollably]

14:51.098 --> 14:52.433
OK, we forfeit.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.978
No, no. Please don't forfeit.
Please keep going.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.232
Show's over.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.611
OK. All right. Jimmy, we're up.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.905
Please don't embarrass me.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.489
Why would I embarrass you?

15:09.533 --> 15:11.285
Great, well, we're off to a good start.

15:11.368 --> 15:12.578
[blows]

15:12.661 --> 15:16.498
[sighs] OK. He's really handsome,
he finally got married--

15:16.582 --> 15:18.167
-George Clooney.
-Yes.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.045
-She was in a mother and daughter--
-Wynonna Judd.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.005
Wow, you're really good at this.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.299
We're really good at this,
just keep going.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.969
-OK. They--
-Harlem Globetrotters.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.763
-She--
-Ariana Grande.

15:30.846 --> 15:31.764
-He--
-SpongeBob.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.057
-Full name.
-SquarePants.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.058
Wow!

15:37.728 --> 15:38.562
That was...

15:38.604 --> 15:39.813
[both] Amazing.

15:41.982 --> 15:42.816
It really was.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.151
I've never felt such a...

15:44.234 --> 15:45.486
[both] ...connection.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.406
What is happening between us?

15:50.199 --> 15:51.283
Mike here.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.960
The Hindus call this kismet.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.879
DJ here.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.298
Nobody cares.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.891
Good job taking a pee in the yard, Cosmo.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.477
Don't tell Mom I did too.

16:19.895 --> 16:20.854
Hey, Max.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.565
Hello, uninvited house guest.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.903
Look at these appetizers.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.489
Bacon-wrapped bacon.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.326
You know I am a strict vegetarian.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.788
You sure you don't want to try

16:37.871 --> 16:41.333
this bacon-wrapped, bacon-flavored bacon,

16:41.417 --> 16:43.460
served on a bed of bacon?

16:46.422 --> 16:49.675
You are a terrible person.

16:53.137 --> 16:53.971
Very well.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.848
More bacon for me.

16:56.473 --> 16:57.349
And for Cosmo.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.148
Come here and give me a big kiss.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.486
[sniffs] Mmm...

17:10.529 --> 17:11.905
Second-hand bacon.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.786
DJ, Mike here.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.290
I gotta be straight with you.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.668
You know, you and me
and love connection, meh.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.129
DJ here.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.380
I totally agree.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.257
Fine.

17:30.340 --> 17:33.719
However, if you're ever up
for something purely physical,

17:34.553 --> 17:37.765
just pop me up a poke
on the face pagey thing.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.896
Oh, Mike, that's the wrong car.
You're getting in the wrong...

17:43.979 --> 17:45.314
Oh, who cares.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.777
All right, hitting the sack.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.028
Goodnight, everyone.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.906
Except for... [sighs]
You know who you are.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.159
What, you're still not talking to me?

17:59.036 --> 17:59.953
[cell beeps]

18:02.456 --> 18:05.209
"No, and this is my last text ever"?

18:07.127 --> 18:09.755
[sighs] You know, enough is enough.

18:09.838 --> 18:10.672
Wait.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.885
Before you have it out with Jackson,
I have a better idea.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.345
Come with me.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.934
You know, I still can't get over
how good we were tonight.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.186
I know. We really should go out.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.690
I don't know. It seems like a...

18:28.774 --> 18:30.400
[both] Bad idea.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.902
Get out of my head!

18:31.985 --> 18:33.445
I will if you go out with me.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.616
All right, I'll go out with you.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.328
Are you sure? Because you don't have to
if you don't want to.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.997
Oh, my God. [laughs nervously]

18:45.165 --> 18:47.126
-I'm gonna go change.
-No, don't change.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.669
I like you just the way you are.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.005
I meant my clothes.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.882
So did I!

18:58.512 --> 19:01.515
-Hey, we're going in the wrong room.
-No, we're not.

19:01.598 --> 19:02.683
[knocks]

19:02.766 --> 19:03.934
Come in.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.229
We're playing Good Cop/Bad Cop.
Follow my lead.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.313
Wait. What?

19:08.897 --> 19:10.399
Oh, don't worry. You're the good cop.

19:13.110 --> 19:13.944
Hi, girls.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.780
You're doing homework on a Saturday night?

19:16.864 --> 19:17.865
Nerd alert.

19:20.742 --> 19:23.662
OK. You and I. Let's have a little chat.

19:23.745 --> 19:24.580
Have a seat.

19:30.043 --> 19:30.878
So, Lola.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.213
If that's your real name.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.718
Is it true Jackson's playing football
just to impress you?

19:38.343 --> 19:39.845
-I don't know.
-[louder] Well, I do!

19:41.555 --> 19:42.389
It's true.

19:42.472 --> 19:45.267
So now that Fuller kid
is gonna get flattened like a pancake

19:45.350 --> 19:47.019
by a 300-pound linebacker.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.980
All for some dame.

19:50.731 --> 19:51.982
Guess who that dame is.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.567
Me?

19:53.650 --> 19:54.735
Bingo!

19:56.403 --> 19:58.071
Your turn. I need to cool off.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.242
OK.

20:03.785 --> 20:04.745
Hi.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.413
I'm the nice one.

20:07.664 --> 20:13.003
OK, I think where my hotheaded partner
is going with this is we're really worried

20:13.086 --> 20:15.881
that Jackson could get
seriously hurt playing football

20:15.964 --> 20:18.759
and he won't listen to us,
but he might listen to you.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.346
Because teenagers don't like to hear
anything from their parents,

20:22.429 --> 20:23.805
right, Ramona?

20:25.265 --> 20:26.642
Huh? I wasn't listening.

20:29.519 --> 20:30.395
I got this.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.566
Your worst nightmare is back.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.361
So here's the deal.

20:37.444 --> 20:40.364
You're gonna march right in there
and tell Jackson, real calm like,

20:40.447 --> 20:42.741
that you don't care
if he plays football. Got it?

20:43.408 --> 20:45.577
OK. Whatever you say.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.413
-Maybe I should go right now.
-Maybe you should.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.249
-OK.
-[DJ] Thank you!

20:51.041 --> 20:51.917
Wow!

20:52.000 --> 20:54.670
If this works, you'll be
like a parenting genius!

20:56.088 --> 20:59.549
I'm so glad you think so,
because I was winging that whole thing.

21:00.717 --> 21:01.635
Hey.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.012
Oh. Hey.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.390
Oh, yeah, this? Yeah, this is Max's.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.809
You know, I'm just making sure
it's structurally sound.

21:11.812 --> 21:12.688
It's not.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.901
Jackson, if you're playing football
just for me--

21:17.985 --> 21:21.196
My mom's trying to stop me, but...
[scoffs] no one tells me what to do.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.533
-I don't care if you play.
-OK, I'm out.

21:26.201 --> 21:29.288
-But you just said--
-I know. I'm complex.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.083
So, uh...
if you're not into football players,

21:33.166 --> 21:34.418
what kind of guys are you into?

21:34.501 --> 21:39.673
Well, I guess I like guys who don't
try too hard to impress a girl.

21:39.756 --> 21:42.259
Ah! Those are
my favorite kind of guys too.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.804
Oh, that came out wrong.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.605
So uh, welcome to my RV.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.149
I call it the Gibbler Galloper.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.610
So where are we going on our date?

22:00.694 --> 22:01.862
Oh, right here.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.989
Yeah, I don't wanna lose my parking spot.

22:05.949 --> 22:09.494
But you live here. I don't
go home with guys on the first date.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.789
Well, sometimes I do,
but there's dinner first.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.499
I've got dinner.

22:17.961 --> 22:19.588
Yeah, I had to have the fryer put in

22:19.671 --> 22:22.090
'cause the RV
doesn't fit through a drive-thru.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.719
So, uh, you want a quick tour? Um...

22:25.802 --> 22:27.345
This is the kitchen,

22:27.429 --> 22:29.765
and if you'll follow me
to dining room...

22:29.848 --> 22:31.099
And here we are.

22:32.601 --> 22:33.518
Hmm.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.687
Oh. What's this map?

22:35.771 --> 22:38.148
[Jimmy]
Oh, uh, that's the world.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.779
I know. [nervous laugh]
I was actually asking about the pins.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.865
Oh, that's every place
I've taken photographs.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.035
Oh, wow.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.787
Those are beautiful.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.873
Yeah. Those were in National Geographic.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.000
What a cool job.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.419
You get to travel the world.

22:59.503 --> 23:02.172
You know, I used to travel
all over the place and deejay

23:02.255 --> 23:03.548
before I moved back home.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.009
Well, you know, sometimes
you have to travel the world

23:06.093 --> 23:08.095
to figure out where you belong.

23:08.178 --> 23:11.473
You know, there's more to you
than meets the eye.

23:12.474 --> 23:15.519
And there's... a lot that meets the eye.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.942
Oh, no. Is... Is this happening again?

23:22.025 --> 23:23.443
I hope so.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.404
Me too.

23:26.488 --> 23:29.282
-Why are we still talking?
-I don't know. Gimme some Jimmy.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.038
[timer pings]

23:37.124 --> 23:38.667
You want some fries with that?

23:39.918 --> 23:41.586
Oh, I want the whole Happy Meal.

23:47.342 --> 23:52.389
Young Thomas, welcome to
Fernando's Snip and Clip.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.394
What are we looking for?
Just a trim or a whole new look?

23:58.228 --> 24:01.064
I could see you with some
Justin Bieber bangs.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.443
What are you doing?

24:05.527 --> 24:07.988
It's another thank you
for letting me live here.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.531
You don't live here.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.620
It's time for Tommy's first haircut.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.498
No. No, it's not time.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.627
Oh, my last baby's last first haircut.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.463
Oh. No, I'm not ready.

24:25.547 --> 24:28.383
What did the checker at Trader Joe's
tell you yesterday?

24:29.551 --> 24:31.553
That I have a very cute little girl.

24:34.681 --> 24:35.599
OK.

24:36.391 --> 24:37.976
I'm just gonna get this over with.

24:38.059 --> 24:39.686
I'm dating a Gibbler and I like it.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.316
I will not be taking questions
at this time.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.359
Hey, guys.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.154
-Hey, Mom.
-Oh, good morning, Jackson.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.449
OK, I'll be right back.
Don't start without me.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.661
Uh, so we're talking again?

24:56.745 --> 25:00.540
Yeah, I've decided to respect
your wishes and not do football.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.252
Well, I appreciate that.

25:05.545 --> 25:09.216
Look, Mom. I'm really sorry
about the whole silent treatment thing.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.843
I was just so mad at you.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.887
And you're allowed to be mad at me.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.681
But you're not allowed
to be disrespectful.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.267
That's not how we
solve problems in this family.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.812
I know. We talk it out, we work it out
and we hug it out.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.107
I love you, Mom.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.525
I love you too.

25:30.445 --> 25:32.155
Come on, DJ. We wanna see this!

25:32.239 --> 25:35.533
OK, everybody grab your cameras.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.495
OK. Just to warn you,

25:38.578 --> 25:40.538
sometimes the baby cries.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.790
And that's OK.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.042
All right.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.462
