12:48.768 --> 12:50.518
FOR HIS FAMILY.

12:50.686 --> 12:53.229
BECAUSE HE HAS US,
HE HAS TO MAKE DO.

12:53.397 --> 12:56.608
THAT'S WHY HE WAS
SO HARSH WITH YOU,

12:56.776 --> 12:59.736
BECAUSE HE WAS HURT
AND ANGRY INSIDE.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.654
IF YOUR PA
WERE ON HIS OWN,

13:01.822 --> 13:03.740
HE'D GIVE
THAT MR. STANDISH
A DRESSING DOWN,

13:03.908 --> 13:05.492
I CAN
GUARANTEE YOU THAT.

13:07.536 --> 13:08.912
ASHAMED.

13:09.079 --> 13:12.749
IF ANYONE SHOULD BE
ASHAMED, IT'S YOU,

13:12.917 --> 13:16.753
FOR JUDGING YOUR PA
SO HARSHLY.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.925

THE BABY TO BED.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.236
ARE YOU
COMING UP, PA?

13:41.403 --> 13:42.737
YEAH. PRETTY SOON.

13:42.905 --> 13:43.947
MR. STANDISH

13:44.114 --> 13:45.865
THEN I'LL BE UP.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.037
I'M SORRY I
YELLED AT YOU TODAY.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.458

NO NEED TO BE.

IT'S LIKE WHAT
YOU ALWAYS SAY--

14:03.801 --> 14:06.761
NOTHING CAN HURT US
AS LONG AS WE'RE

14:28.826 --> 14:30.451

TO CUT DOWN ON THE SIZE
OF THE PORTIONS.

14:30.619 --> 14:33.454
IF FOLKS WANT MORE,
LET THEM ORDER IT
SEPARATELY.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.123

Standish: I TOLD YOU,
NO MORE CREDIT.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.843

GOING, DIDN'T I?

16:18.686 --> 16:19.769
OH, YOU SURE DID.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.396
IF I'D HAVE
DONE THAT YESTERDAY,

16:21.563 --> 16:23.564
HE'D HAVE
THROWN ME RIGHT OUT
ON THE STREET.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.608

I HOPE YOU DON'T
TAKE STANDISH UP ON HIS
INVITATION TO PLAY CARDS.

16:33.617 --> 16:34.659
NOPE.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.869

IS FIND SOMEBODY WHO
CAN HANDLE THE FUSES,

17:18.537 --> 17:20.329

MAKE THEM WORK--BANG.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.040

SOME EXPERIENCE
WITH THEM.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.976
I WAS THINKING,
THIS ISN'T GOING TO
MAKE STANDISH TOO HAPPY.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.353

TROUBLE GETTING OFF
THAT NIGHT.
