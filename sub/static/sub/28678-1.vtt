WEBVTT

00:08.709 --> 00:11.944
[panting heavily]

00:15.549 --> 00:16.482
[panicked gasping]

00:16.517 --> 00:17.850
I swear I won't say anything!!!

00:17.885 --> 00:19.785
Please, you don't
have to do this!

00:19.820 --> 00:20.686
[screams]

00:20.721 --> 00:22.421
[gunshot]

00:42.009 --> 00:44.343
So, the pest control guys
have my office building

00:44.378 --> 00:46.145
completely sealed off.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.980
I'm gonna have to work
from home the next week.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.848
Woah, you seeing patients
in your house?

00:49.884 --> 00:51.083
Only in case of emergency.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.918
I'm pretty much on standby.

00:52.953 --> 00:53.786
I'll just use the time
to catch up

00:53.821 --> 00:56.388
on the latest
psychiatric journals.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.189
Fun.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.024
You ever consider taking
a holiday?

00:59.060 --> 01:01.894
Actually, Sabrina just booked
a beach vacation,

01:01.929 --> 01:04.430
but I just get so bored laying
around all the time.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.631
[sarcastically]
You? No.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.066
[laughs]

01:07.101 --> 01:08.901
Woah, Kurt.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.569
It's so great to see you.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.637
You too.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.072
What are you doing in Atlanta?

01:13.107 --> 01:14.907
Oh, I transferred
to the base in Albany.

01:14.942 --> 01:17.476
I'm in logistics, and
my wife Kayla's here now.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.979
Oh, so sorry, uh, Kurt,
this is my friend Hailey.

01:21.015 --> 01:22.948
Kurt and I served together
in the Marine Corps,

01:22.983 --> 01:25.250
and Hailey and I served together
at the DA's office.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.151
Nice to meet you.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.086
Likewise.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.187
[phone rings]

01:28.222 --> 01:29.521
Oh, uh, excuse me.

01:29.557 --> 01:32.724
[phone rings]

01:32.760 --> 01:34.793
Ah...

01:34.829 --> 01:35.994
Everything okay?

01:36.030 --> 01:37.296
Uh, not the call I was
hoping for.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.764
Uh, how long you
in town for?

01:38.799 --> 01:40.165
You here for the day?
What's going on?

01:40.201 --> 01:41.166
I'm here half the week.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.167
On base the other half.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.102
I'm in charge of the contractors
out of Atlanta,

01:43.137 --> 01:45.737
so I'm doing inspection,
arranging transpo,

01:45.773 --> 01:46.805
that kind of thing.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.273
Not exactly like patrolling
a stretch of desert

01:48.309 --> 01:49.975
littered with IEDs,
now, is it?

01:50.010 --> 01:54.546
Not exactly, but uh, just...
just as dangerous.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.750
You know, we're all going out
to dinner tomorrow night,

01:58.786 --> 02:00.452
you and your wife should come
along with us.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.121
Oh. Yeah, Kayla would
really like that.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.355
Yeah, she could use some
friends in this city.

02:03.390 --> 02:06.024
Well, great, you can tell me
all about Fincher the Marine.

02:06.060 --> 02:09.328
Only if you tell me all about
Fincher the investigator.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.063
Do I get to join
this conversation?

02:11.098 --> 02:12.197
We'll see.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.165
[laughs]

02:13.200 --> 02:14.166
It was great to see you, man.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.567
-My man, all right.
-Bye.

02:15.603 --> 02:16.768
Nice meeting you.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.070
[laughs]

02:20.007 --> 02:21.773
So, one night we were
out on patrol,

02:21.809 --> 02:23.976
and I found a dead
camel spider.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.410
And I don't know if you've
ever seen them,

02:25.446 --> 02:26.478
but they're pretty big.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.113
Pretty big? Just
as big as my hand.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.381
[laughs]

02:29.416 --> 02:32.284
So when he went to sleep,
I slipped one in his boot.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.152
No.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.020
I got woken up to
the loudest scream

02:35.055 --> 02:36.722
I have ever heard
in my entire life.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.023
[laughs]

02:38.058 --> 02:38.924
[laughs]

02:38.959 --> 02:40.425
That is just like med school.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.227
Tell 'em why.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.463
Turns out, the spider
wasn't dead.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.964
[group groans]
Ohhhh!

02:46.000 --> 02:47.733
Now I know why
you're afraid of spiders.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.368
Yes, I'm scarred
to this day.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.336
[group laughs]

02:51.372 --> 02:52.504
[whisper]
Put it away.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.473
You don't need to check your
phone every three seconds.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.408
Sorry. I'm just expecting
a call.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.544
Uh, you're always expecting
a call.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.579
[clears throat uncomfortably]

03:00.614 --> 03:01.747
So, Kurt.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.216
How is it that you've been
based in Atlanta?

03:04.251 --> 03:05.484
Are you a recruiter?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.853
Uh, no. I'm posted to the base
in Albany,

03:07.888 --> 03:10.656
but my job is to liaise
with the civilian contractors

03:10.691 --> 03:11.823
based here in Atlanta.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.493
So I'm here half the week,
and on base the other half.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.161
Kaylie gets to live in
a regular city again

03:16.197 --> 03:17.396
like a normal civilian,

03:17.431 --> 03:18.897
and I get to spend
a lot of time with her.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.499
And there's no camel
spiders here, so...

03:20.534 --> 03:21.099
Yes.

03:21.135 --> 03:22.568
None.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.102
Where's the ladies' room?

03:24.138 --> 03:25.470
Oh, it's in the back.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.738
Thank you.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.374
Kurt, I have the same
fitness tracker,

03:29.410 --> 03:30.943
and I love it.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.011
Oh, uh, Kayla bought it
for me.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.980
Honestly, I don't even know how
to work the thing.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.616
I wear it for her, but really,
I just use it for a watch.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.218
I noticed a huge difference
in my workouts.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.286
I can show you how to use it
if you'd like.

03:41.322 --> 03:44.189
I might take you up
on that some time.

03:44.225 --> 03:47.159
Excuse me, I... I need
to make a call.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.594
[whispers]
Yeah.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.495
Maybe you should go
check up on him.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.797
Mm.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.201
Oh. You may not know this,
but I was recently made chair

03:56.237 --> 03:58.503
of the fundraising committee
at Atlanta Memorial.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.938
Congratulations, Megan.

03:59.974 --> 04:00.639
Thank you.

04:00.674 --> 04:01.907
I'm very excited.

04:01.942 --> 04:05.177
So, I've put together a calendar
featuring men at the hospital.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.078
That's a great idea.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.012
I thought so.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.681
But, I've hit a bit of a snag.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.183
So, it's sitting
at the printers,

04:11.218 --> 04:13.385
about to be assembled
and shipped off.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.387
But one of my models had
a change of heart

04:15.422 --> 04:19.858
and he won't sign the release,
so I'm without a Mr. November,

04:19.893 --> 04:24.062
and unless I find one,
the whole project is sunk.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.334
Are you asking me to do it?

04:29.370 --> 04:30.902
I know you work
for the city coroner,

04:30.938 --> 04:33.572
which means you
don't technically work
for the hospital,

04:33.607 --> 04:37.242
but you... you work with
us all the time.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.510
[laughs in disbelief]

04:38.545 --> 04:39.878
And I'm desperate, Jonas.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.513
I can't find anyone.

04:41.548 --> 04:44.449
And, if things fall apart, I
will have blown our budget

04:44.485 --> 04:48.353
for the year with
nothing to show for it.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.855
[uncomfortably] I, I
don't, I don't know...

04:49.890 --> 04:51.823
Just think about it.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.759
But get back to me
by tomorrow, okay?

04:53.794 --> 04:54.860
Oh, okay.

04:54.895 --> 04:55.761
[laughs]

04:55.796 --> 04:56.695
No pressure.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.430
I think I need another drink.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.166
What's going on with you
and Kayla?

05:01.201 --> 05:03.902
We're just trying
to adjust to all this,

05:03.937 --> 05:07.973
and I've been a bit
preoccupied lately.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.074
Yeah.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.209
You get in touch with whoever's
got you so worried?

05:11.245 --> 05:12.177
[laughs]

05:12.212 --> 05:13.412
I'm not so good with
the subterfuge, am I?

05:13.447 --> 05:16.281
Mm-mm. You never were.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.884
You wanna talk about it?

05:18.919 --> 05:23.188
Uh... It's not the right time.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.389
Whenever.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.625
There's no expiration date
on my offer.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.127
Thanks, I, uh, might take
you up on that.

05:29.163 --> 05:32.331
Just... not yet.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.300
Here you are.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.002
What happened?

05:37.037 --> 05:39.438
I, I just have a headache.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.572
I'm going home.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.873
Um, you can stay if you want.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.309
No, no. Let's go.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.944
Um, give my excuses
to everyone, will ya?

05:45.979 --> 05:46.878
Of course.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.180
It's nice to see you, Fincher.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.948
You too.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.983
Call me, okay?
I mean it.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.985
I will.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.696
You're quiet.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.065
Am I going too fast for you?

06:07.101 --> 06:08.600
Oh. No, I've just been thinking
about what Megan

06:08.635 --> 06:10.435
was asking me last night.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.170
Oh, the calendar.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.906
Yeah, I mean, I know how
expensive it is

06:14.942 --> 06:18.577
for hospitals to stay current
and fundraising is essential.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.578
True.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.512
But I just don't think
I'm the kind of person

06:20.547 --> 06:22.647
who likes to be the centre
of attention.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.216
You're the centre
of my attention.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.050
[laughs]

06:25.085 --> 06:27.886
My favourite place to be.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.621
What do you think?

06:29.656 --> 06:31.223
I think you should do it.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.991
It's good for the hospital
and it's good for you

06:33.026 --> 06:34.459
to do something you
don't normally do.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.762
Besides, I wouldn't mind
dating a model.

06:36.797 --> 06:37.996
[laughs]

06:38.031 --> 06:40.165
A medical examiner doesn't
do it for ya?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.801
Why can't I have both?

06:42.836 --> 06:45.537
I guess at the very least I can
guarantee them one sale.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.707
Two. I'll need
one for my office.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.142
All right then,
I'll do it.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.042
Okay.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.310
We're gonna have to pick up
the pace.

06:52.346 --> 06:54.579
You're gonna need to be in shape
if you're gonna be all famous.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.847
[laughs]

06:55.883 --> 06:57.249
I'm hardly going to be famous,
it's just a hospital calendar.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.484
Oh, stop making excuses
because you're slow.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.552
[laughs]
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

07:00.587 --> 07:01.787
Okay, it's on.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.221
I'll race you to
the last lamppost.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.523
Okay.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.124
[calls] Winner buys breakfast.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.093
<i> [laughs]</i>
<i> Of course.</i>

07:14.268 --> 07:16.601
[laughs]
I got you.

07:16.637 --> 07:20.772
[phone buzzes]

07:20.808 --> 07:22.841
Hey, Kurt. What's going on?

07:22.876 --> 07:24.643
Fincher?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.745
I think I need to take you up
on your offer.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.512
<i> To help.</i>

07:27.548 --> 07:29.981
Yeah, yeah, what's up?

07:30.017 --> 07:32.117
Not over the phone.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.820
Um, okay, well I'm... I'm on
a stakeout right now,

07:34.855 --> 07:38.123
<i>but... I can swing by your place</i>
<i> in about an hour?</i>

07:38.158 --> 07:39.024
I have to head to base,

07:39.059 --> 07:42.360
but I'll be back
in Atlanta on Sunday.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.229
Okay, man. Um, Sunday.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.631
Sunday's fine, we can meet up.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.266
You... Kurt, you sure
you're okay?

07:48.302 --> 07:50.702
Yeah, um...

07:50.737 --> 07:52.237
Maybe not.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.773
We'll talk on Sunday.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.210
Okay. All right, man.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.344
[sighs]

07:59.379 --> 08:03.248
[knocking at door]

08:03.283 --> 08:05.917
[knocking continues]

08:13.393 --> 08:14.960
Good job on the Brody case.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.394
I think we might get
a conviction

08:16.430 --> 08:18.196
with that corroborating
evidence you found.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.865
Oh, my pleasure,
Ms. District Attorney.

08:19.900 --> 08:20.799
[laughs]

08:20.834 --> 08:23.468
You do not have
to call me that, Fincher.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.970
Paulina will be fine.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.071
I know.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.372
I just love that you won
the election, that's all.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.907
Yeah, more than a year ago.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.342
[laughs]

08:30.377 --> 08:32.377
Hey, by the way, have you
seen Hailey?

08:32.412 --> 08:33.712
Yeah, I see Hailey all the time.

08:33.747 --> 08:34.779
How's she doing?

08:34.815 --> 08:36.314
Getting in trouble,
as per usual.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.215
[laughs]

08:37.251 --> 08:38.783
I've been meaning
to give her a call.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.719
You should, she would love
to hear from you.

08:40.754 --> 08:41.653
I will do.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.554
See you later.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.321
All right.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.289
Mr. Garland.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.290
Yes.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.658
Sergeant Nesbit.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.626
How may I be of service?

08:47.661 --> 08:50.095
We're looking for Staff Sergeant
Kurt Cullen.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.363
Have you been in contact
with him?

08:51.398 --> 08:54.366
We spoke yesterday, but
you already know that.

08:54.401 --> 08:55.767
What did you talk about?

08:55.802 --> 08:59.271
Uh, we made plans to get
together on Sunday.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.939
Do you know his current
whereabouts?

09:00.974 --> 09:03.642
I assumed he was on base.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.845
Please call me immediately
if you do hear from him.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.147
I will when you tell me exactly
what this is all about.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.315
Staff Sergeant Cullen

09:10.350 --> 09:12.517
is in violation of his
terms of service.

09:12.553 --> 09:13.885
How so?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.754
He failed to report for duty
this morning,

09:15.789 --> 09:17.622
and is currently absent
without leave.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.357
He's AWOL? No way.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.793
If you do hear from him,
please tell me.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.862
I can still keep him from
getting into too much trouble,

09:23.897 --> 09:26.131
but not for much longer.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.301
Thanks, Sergeant.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.368
Thank you.

09:30.404 --> 09:31.636
All right.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.680
Hey, Hailey are you free?

09:41.715 --> 09:43.815
Yeah, I think I need your help
with somethin'.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.118
I just can't believe he would
do this to me,

09:47.154 --> 09:48.954
especially since I told him

09:48.989 --> 09:51.056
I'm not comfortable in this
house sometimes.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.358
Are you having trouble being
alone when he's on base?

09:53.393 --> 09:56.127
Kurt's been overseas
for most of our marriage.

09:56.163 --> 09:59.831
I'm not afraid to be alone,
but...

09:59.866 --> 10:04.202
the past few days, I've just...
I've just had this feeling.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.537
What feeling?

10:05.572 --> 10:08.607
I swear someone's
been watching this house.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.408
Well, have you seen anybody?

10:10.444 --> 10:11.476
No.

10:11.511 --> 10:14.279
I'm sure it's just my mind
playing tricks on me.

10:14.314 --> 10:18.316
I've been angry with Kurt,
and... and I've just been
on edge.

10:18.352 --> 10:21.286
What's been troubling you?

10:21.321 --> 10:22.454
Nothing.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.556
Something to do with Kurt?

10:25.559 --> 10:28.026
You have an idea
of what's happening,

10:28.061 --> 10:31.796
and I can see that you find
it deeply hurtful.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.465
We're here to support you.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.067
I just want to find Kurt
before the MPs do,

10:36.103 --> 10:38.103
and help him with
whatever trouble he's in.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.204
Well, I don't know
what's going on.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.705
I don't know anything
for sure.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.474
What do you suspect?

10:45.445 --> 10:48.680
I think Kurt's left me
for another woman.

10:48.715 --> 10:49.981
No.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.383
Why would you think that?

10:51.418 --> 10:53.785
He keeps secrets.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.822
He pretends like he's in Atlanta
to spend time with me, but...

10:57.858 --> 11:00.392
when he's here,
I barely see him.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.527
How long has he been like this?

11:02.562 --> 11:04.362
A few weeks, maybe.

11:04.398 --> 11:06.698
We've only been here
four months.

11:06.733 --> 11:11.302
Kurt told me the whole reason
he took a transfer was for you.

11:11.338 --> 11:17.976
Yeah, maybe it was... then,
but things have changed.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.346
I know it's hard, but try not
to jump to conclusions.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.315
There may be another
explanation.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.284
We'll find him, Kayla.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.620
I promise.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.757
I just can't believe that Kurt
would run off on Kayla,

11:32.793 --> 11:33.725
even if they were
having problems.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.926
I mean, he wouldn't do
something like that.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.996
We all sensed the tension
between them the other night.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.531
Yeah, but the man
I served with,

11:39.566 --> 11:41.166
he wasn't a deserter
or a cheater.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.367
Well, people change.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.936
Fincher, you haven't known
him for a while.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.471
Yeah, but you just don't get it,
Hailey.

11:46.506 --> 11:47.572
You can't.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.874
Serving in the military is like
having another family.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.310
You don't like everyone, you
don't get along with everyone,

11:52.345 --> 11:54.079
but you're brothers
all the same.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.081
And you know them
like no-one else,

11:56.116 --> 11:59.184
not like their parents,
not like their wives.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.686
And I'm telling you,
I know Kurt Cullen.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.722
He's not that kind of guy.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.763
Sorry to ask for your help,
Monty.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.331
I know with Danny being
away in Florida

12:13.366 --> 12:15.300
for his parents' anniversary,
you must be swamped.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.468
That's not it, Fincher.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.203
You know I would love
to help you out,

12:18.238 --> 12:19.671
but it's not our jurisdiction,

12:19.706 --> 12:22.107
and the military MPs have
not asked for our help.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.842
Is there really nothing
you can do?

12:23.877 --> 12:25.877
Look, I am sure the MPs are
doing everything

12:25.912 --> 12:27.679
that we would in this situation.

12:27.714 --> 12:31.583
I'm really sorry.
My hands are tied.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.751
I understand.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.052
So now what?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.253
Well, he left his phone at home,

12:35.288 --> 12:36.421
so even if we could get
in to it,

12:36.456 --> 12:38.690
it won't tell us
where he is now.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.191
What about his fitness
tracker?

12:40.227 --> 12:43.094
It's the same one I had,
it has GPS.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.596
Well, how do we access it?

12:44.631 --> 12:46.664
We just log in.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.502
Let's hope he didn't change
his password.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.904
Well, Kayla bought Kurt
the fitness tracker,

12:52.939 --> 12:54.405
and he said he didn't know
how to use it,

12:54.441 --> 12:56.641
so my guess is he never
even logged in to his account,

12:56.676 --> 13:00.478
much less changed
the default password...

13:00.514 --> 13:03.014
And...

13:03.049 --> 13:04.516
I'm in.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.117
What can you see?

13:06.153 --> 13:08.920
Well, the fitness tracker
is not currently active,

13:08.955 --> 13:11.523
but that could just mean
that he took it off.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.424
Uh... Can you see the last time
it was active?

13:13.460 --> 13:17.929
9:00 PM last night, but after
that it goes dark, nothing else.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.030
Where was he at 9:00 PM?

13:19.065 --> 13:20.965
Still in Atlanta.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.066
That's odd.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.536
Should've been halfway back
to Albany by that time.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.104
Does it say exactly where?

13:26.139 --> 13:26.938
It does.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.607
The wooded area
of Piercedale Park.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.078
This is it.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.281
Let's go see what
we can find.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.918
Are we in the right spot?

13:39.953 --> 13:42.921
Well, the coordinates
on the fitness tracker

13:42.956 --> 13:44.823
show it to be
basically right here.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.525
If there's something to find,
it's pretty close.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.127
[sighs]

14:00.507 --> 14:02.273
There it is!

14:18.291 --> 14:19.858
Couldn't find anything on him.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.060
Anything in the surrounding
area?

14:22.095 --> 14:23.394
Wallet? Keys?

14:23.430 --> 14:25.263
Nothing. No ID on him at all.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.531
Could've been a robbery.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.733
But, why leave
the fitness tracker?

14:28.768 --> 14:30.134
True.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.003
Oh, it looks like Sergeant
Cullen's car

14:32.038 --> 14:33.571
is across the street.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.874
We found a small amount of
blood evidence in the back seat.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.809
So, he was killed
somewhere else?

14:37.844 --> 14:39.177
More likely injured.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.779
We're canvassing the area
for a security camera,

14:41.815 --> 14:44.215
but it's a bit of a dead zone.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.586
I guess you had to call them.

14:48.622 --> 14:50.154
You know I had to.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.923
Crimes involving active
duty personnel

14:51.958 --> 14:54.058
fall under the
military jurisdiction.

14:54.094 --> 14:57.262
Looks like we're about to be
kicked off this investigation.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.696
I'm afraid so.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.232
Mr. Garland.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.934
I'm sorry we have to meet again
like this.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.102
Likewise.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.603
I know Staff Sergeant Cullen
was your friend,

15:05.639 --> 15:07.005
and I want you to know
that we'll do everything

15:07.040 --> 15:08.473
that we can to find
out what happened.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.241
Thank you, I appreciate it.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.143
It's the least I can do.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.012
Shall we?

15:15.882 --> 15:17.348
So the Marines are taking over?

15:17.384 --> 15:19.851
Yeah, I didn't think they would
get here so fast.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.553
I don't suppose you, uh,
saw anything?

15:22.589 --> 15:25.823
Not much, but the cause
of death was fairly clear.

15:25.859 --> 15:28.092
Gunshot wound to the temple.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.627
Rigor supports
the time of death,

15:29.663 --> 15:32.196
it was close to when his fitness
tracker stopped reporting.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.731
I also saw bruising on his neck

15:33.767 --> 15:36.167
that could've been from
a necklace being torn off.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.369
Yeah, his dog tags are missing.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.171
His hands were a
bit scruffed up,

15:40.206 --> 15:41.339
his fingernails torn.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.874
He was a Marine,
he fought back.

15:42.909 --> 15:46.244
Bruising around his wrists
may mean he was restrained,

15:46.279 --> 15:48.046
but there is also a lump
on his head that indicates

15:48.081 --> 15:50.682
some kind of trauma
was inflicted pre-mortem.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.383
Yeah, so that explains the small
amount of blood

15:52.419 --> 15:53.551
in the backseat of his car.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.820
So he fought back, and then
he was hit over the head,

15:55.855 --> 15:58.022
which probably incapacitated
him.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.625
His wrists were bound and
he was thrown into his car.

16:00.660 --> 16:01.826
And brought here
to be executed.

16:01.861 --> 16:04.796
It's all speculation until a
proper autopsy is performed,

16:04.831 --> 16:08.499
but unfortunately... I
won't be the one to do it.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.435
I'm sorry, Fincher.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.370
I'll do my best to liaise
with the military police,

16:12.405 --> 16:15.440
but in my experience,
they do not like to share.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.442
No, they do not.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.344
Thanks for everything.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.446
Whatever I can do, Fincher.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.589
You okay?

16:31.624 --> 16:32.991
You already know the answer
to that.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.325
Fincher, I am so sorry.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.361
Just trying to wrap my mind
around it.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.829
This is Kurt.

16:37.864 --> 16:38.896
A US Marine.

16:38.932 --> 16:40.365
He didn't deserve
to die like that.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.734
No, he didn't.

16:42.769 --> 16:43.434
I don't like it, Hailey.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.869
I don't like it one little bit.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.671
Are you gonna investigate?

16:49.175 --> 16:51.843
I have to find out
who did this to him.

16:51.878 --> 16:54.245
He would do the same for me.

16:59.285 --> 17:02.186
Lieutenant Chris Young,
this is my husband's friend

17:02.222 --> 17:05.556
Fincher Garland, and his friend
Hailey Dean.

17:05.592 --> 17:10.561
Lieutenant Young is... was...
Kurt's commanding officer.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.797
Fincher Garland.
You served in Iraq with Kurt.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.165
That's right.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.134
I remember him mentioning you.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.602
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.636
Thank you.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.571
Lieutenant Young was
just paying his respects.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.707
But I should be heading back.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.076
It's... a long drive to Albany.

17:25.111 --> 17:28.346
If you need anything at all,
you call me.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.548
Thank you.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.417
I'll walk you out.

17:36.022 --> 17:38.156
Kurt wanted to talk to me
about something.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.291
I thought he might be
in some kind of trouble.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.493
Did he say what?

17:42.529 --> 17:43.594
No.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.830
We were supposed
to meet next weekend.

17:45.865 --> 17:50.068
He didn't say anything to you,
about anything unusual at work,

17:50.103 --> 17:52.603
or anything else, maybe?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.372
Not that I recall.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.506
And even if I did,

17:55.542 --> 18:00.778
you know I wouldn't be able to
tell you as a civilian.

18:00.814 --> 18:02.880
No. I know.

18:02.916 --> 18:06.117
It's hard to accept the death
of our brothers anytime.

18:06.152 --> 18:10.254
Even less when it's a random
mugging like this.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.657
The MPs are calling this
a random attack?

18:12.692 --> 18:15.526
Well, that's the current theory.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.895
Gunshot to the head is
more like an execution.

18:17.931 --> 18:25.203
Look. I can only tell you what
they're telling me.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.939
Did Kurt have any trouble
with anybody on the base?

18:27.974 --> 18:30.041
I know you want answers.

18:30.076 --> 18:32.510
But you know this wasn't
a military issue.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.812
It happened in a park
here in the city.

18:34.848 --> 18:38.082
Sometimes tragedies
don't make sense.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.486
We spend enough time overseas
to know that.

18:41.521 --> 18:46.257
I'm glad to know Mrs. Cullen has
a former Marine here in Atlanta

18:46.292 --> 18:48.459
to look out for her.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.837
I just feel so guilty.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.105
I was so angry,

19:01.141 --> 19:02.640
I don't even remember
what I said to him

19:02.675 --> 19:04.208
the last time we talked.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.576
Why were you angry?

19:05.612 --> 19:08.246
Because he cancelled
our dinner plans, again.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.281
Were you here when Kurt
left home?

19:10.316 --> 19:11.549
No, I was picking up takeout

19:11.584 --> 19:15.353
so that we could have a quick
dinner before he left for base.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.522
And by the time I got back,
he was gone.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.191
Did he leave a note
or any explanation?

19:20.226 --> 19:26.430
No. I knew something was going
on, but he wouldn't tell me.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.799
That's why I thought he was
seeing someone else.

19:28.835 --> 19:35.306
Well, he insisted he wasn't,
but... I didn't believe him.

19:35.341 --> 19:38.910
I didn't know I'd never
see him again.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.778
And I don't know
why he was in that park

19:40.813 --> 19:42.947
when he should've been home.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.282
Kayla.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.817
This wasn't your fault.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.086
[tearfully] What if it was?

19:49.122 --> 19:50.655
An affair? I just don't buy it.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.023
No matter how well
you know someone,

19:52.058 --> 19:54.392
you can never know
their inner turmoil.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.927
The jealous lover?

19:55.962 --> 19:57.762
Ah, that's very unlikely to me.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.130
Unlikely doesn't
mean impossible.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.731
And we cannot discount
the idea that there was

20:00.767 --> 20:02.867
someone stalking Kurt and
Kayla's house.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.101
Yeah, but by that theory,

20:04.137 --> 20:06.337
the... the jealous lover and the
stalker are the same person.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.206
Something to keep in mind.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.407
You know, I don't know anything

20:09.442 --> 20:12.276
about Kurt's life here in
Atlanta, or on base in Albany.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.212
But you know there's a whole
bunch of reasons

20:14.247 --> 20:15.446
why this coulda happened.

20:15.481 --> 20:16.547
And I don't believe what that
Lieutenant Young was saying

20:16.583 --> 20:19.317
about how this could
be a random mugging in the park.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.284
Is that what he told you?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.686
Yeah.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.488
He wasn't very receptive when
I asked if Kurt had any issues

20:24.524 --> 20:26.257
with anybody here
or on the base.

20:26.292 --> 20:31.028
Doesn't seem like the open,
sharing kinda guy.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.797
Fincher, I'm sorry.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.366
I know all this uncertainty
is painful.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.235
You know, I gotta know
the truth, Hailey.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.070
Because the military
has jurisdiction on this,

20:39.105 --> 20:40.805
that means I can't officially
investigate

20:40.840 --> 20:41.806
from the DA's office,

20:41.841 --> 20:44.008
and Atlanta PD won't be anywhere
near this case.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.077
Well, it's a good thing
we're not Atlanta PD.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.145
We can start by retracing
his steps.

20:48.181 --> 20:49.480
How?

20:49.515 --> 20:51.682
Well, the fitness tracker
has 48 hours

20:51.718 --> 20:54.385
of Kurt's movement recorded.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.386
That's a start.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.687
Mmhmm.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.925
So, this is the last place
Kurt went

21:00.960 --> 21:02.893
after he left his house
the day he died.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.595
Greystone Foods Inc.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.764
Yeah, it was probably
one of his inspections.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.232
Looks like a distribution
centre.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.500
Distributing what?

21:09.535 --> 21:10.468
The Marines,

21:10.503 --> 21:12.069
they contract civilian
companies for supplies.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.938
This could be anything
from toilet paper

21:13.973 --> 21:16.641
to computer hardware
to uniforms.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.042
And Kurt had to make sure
the suppliers

21:18.077 --> 21:19.710
were fulfilling their
contracts properly.

21:19.746 --> 21:22.280
I mean, I guess Marines
overseas have bigger things

21:22.315 --> 21:24.115
to worry about than running
out of toilet paper.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.083
Yeah, it's been known to happen.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.518
And Kurt had a big
responsibility

21:27.553 --> 21:29.954
to keep the supply chain moving.

21:32.325 --> 21:34.692
I'm sorry, this area is
employees only.

21:34.727 --> 21:35.860
It's a safety issue.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.328
Uh, we're looking
for someone in charge.

21:37.363 --> 21:38.696
That's me, Alisa Greystone.

21:38.731 --> 21:39.964
This is my company.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.466
We were hoping to ask you
about Kurt Cullen.

21:42.502 --> 21:45.670
Well, I've already spoken to the
military police, are you...

21:45.705 --> 21:48.172
Just following up
on a few things.

21:48.207 --> 21:49.373
Whatever I can do
to help.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.408
Of course.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.609
What do you supply here?

21:51.644 --> 21:53.511
We supply the MREs.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.012
That's uh, Meals Ready to Eat.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.381
It's the prepackaged food
the military would issue to us

21:57.417 --> 22:00.051
while we were on patrol
or otherwise off base.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.152
A lot of guys love it.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.320
I was not one of them.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.121
Well, we do our best, but
they're designed to nourish

22:04.157 --> 22:08.225
and never go bad, so taste
is not the highest priority.

22:08.261 --> 22:09.293
Would you like to try?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.395
Just add water to the line
on the heater package,

22:11.431 --> 22:14.398
then put in the food package
and it self-heats in minutes.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.300
That's amazing.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.869
Did you notice anything unusual
about the way Sergeant Cullen

22:18.905 --> 22:20.638
was acting the last time
you saw him?

22:20.673 --> 22:23.874
He did seem a bit preoccupied,
but I didn't know him that well.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.344
He'd only been doing the
inspections for a few weeks.

22:26.379 --> 22:28.779
Sergeant Cullen
was very by-the-book.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.614
Must've made those
first few inspections

22:30.650 --> 22:31.682
pretty nerve-wracking.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.218
Well, I wanted everything
to go well, for sure.

22:34.253 --> 22:37.455
Oh, and did it?

22:37.490 --> 22:38.322
I don't know what
you're talking about,

22:38.358 --> 22:42.159
and I don't appreciate
the insinuation.

22:42.195 --> 22:46.030
If you can just answer
the question?

22:46.065 --> 22:47.798
I don't think I will.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.568
And I'm not sure that I have
to talk to you at all.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.770
You can see yourselves out.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.473
Well.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.243
So, where to next?

22:59.278 --> 23:00.544
Across town.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.580
Address belongs to Houston
Industries.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.647
Another inspection.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.249
Yeah, most likely.

23:08.821 --> 23:11.922
Hey, it's just the one
skid today, okay?

23:11.958 --> 23:13.357
Hi, can I help you?

23:13.393 --> 23:16.227
Yeah, I'm a friend
of Kurt Cullen's.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.295
So sorry. I heard
about what happened.

23:18.331 --> 23:19.430
Such a shock.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.531
You were friends?

23:20.566 --> 23:22.366
Uh, yeah, we went out
for beers a couple of times.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.567
He's a nice guy.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.169
Very dedicated to his work.

23:25.204 --> 23:28.773
Yeah, he uh, ever talk to you
about anything personal?

23:28.808 --> 23:30.508
No, not really.

23:30.543 --> 23:33.210
But you sensed something
was wrong.

23:33.246 --> 23:35.179
I got the feeling there were
problems at home,

23:35.214 --> 23:36.113
but I never asked.

23:36.149 --> 23:38.516
Any, uh, problems
with your inspections?

23:38.551 --> 23:39.517
Uh, no, never.

23:39.552 --> 23:42.586
I've had the contract
for five years, so...

23:42.622 --> 23:43.821
I pretty much
know the drill.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.089
Yeah.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.524
What do you, uh, supply here?

23:46.559 --> 23:47.925
Uh, kitchen supplies.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.294
Pots, cutlery,
that sort of thing.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.228
Last time you saw Kurt?

23:51.264 --> 23:53.364
When he showed up here,
did an inspection,

23:53.399 --> 23:56.700
a little faster than usual
I'd say, but that was it.

23:56.736 --> 23:57.968
I'm sorry for your loss,

23:58.004 --> 24:01.705
but uh, I don't think I can be
much more help to you than that.

24:01.741 --> 24:04.909
Still, if you need
anything else,

24:04.944 --> 24:07.378
here's my card.

24:07.413 --> 24:08.379
Thanks for your time.

24:08.414 --> 24:09.747
Okay.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.883
So, Kurt left his house
in the morning as usual,

24:12.919 --> 24:15.119
and he went to his two
scheduled inspections.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.187
Mmhmm.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.254
Both check out.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.623
Looks like Tom also deals
in commercial kitchens,

24:19.659 --> 24:21.358
has a good reputation.

24:21.394 --> 24:22.660
Honest businessman.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.628
What about
Elisa Greystone?

24:24.664 --> 24:26.597
Uh, relatively newly
incorporated.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.567
No civilian clients,
she's a failed chef,

24:29.602 --> 24:31.402
apparently her last kitchen
was shut down

24:31.437 --> 24:32.870
for repeated
safety violations.

24:32.905 --> 24:35.105
So it's possible that Kurt
discovered something

24:35.141 --> 24:36.941
that wasn't up to marine
standards,

24:36.976 --> 24:39.210
and maybe her contract
was in jeopardy.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.945
It's not anything
we can confirm, but I...

24:40.980 --> 24:41.912
I'll keep digging.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.215
Okay, so then... after
his two inspections,

24:44.250 --> 24:45.916
he went home at 6:00 PM.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.718
Right, when he spoke to me
and told me he was going

24:47.753 --> 24:48.953
to the base later that night.

24:48.988 --> 24:52.022
Only, he didn't go to the base,
he stayed home for an hour,

24:52.058 --> 24:54.758
then he went to the park
at 7:00 PM, his last stop.

24:54.794 --> 24:55.759
Right.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.495
You probably weren't the
last person he spoke to.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.696
Right.

24:58.731 --> 24:59.663
And we know in that time he
had an argument with Kayla,

24:59.699 --> 25:01.465
we just don't know if it was
before or after

25:01.501 --> 25:02.766
he spoke with me.

25:02.802 --> 25:05.503
And then his fitness tracker
went dark at 9:00 PM.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.542
Fincher, we don't have
to do this right now.

25:11.577 --> 25:14.612
Hailey, you know I'm not going
to stop till I get to the truth.

25:14.647 --> 25:17.414
What did he do in the park
for two hours?

25:17.450 --> 25:18.949
Why didn't he take his phone
with him?

25:18.985 --> 25:20.217
Was he meeting somebody?

25:20.253 --> 25:22.286
This whole case doesn't make
any sense.

25:22.321 --> 25:25.723
[phone buzzes]

25:25.758 --> 25:27.992
Fincher Garland.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.060
Of course.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.962
I'll come to you.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.664
[call ends]

25:33.699 --> 25:35.299
That was Sergeant Nesbit.

25:35.334 --> 25:37.101
MP in charge of
the investigation.

25:37.136 --> 25:41.205
Turns out I was the last person
that Kurt spoke to.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.840
So you're a suspect.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.575
Person of interest.

25:44.610 --> 25:47.444
Oh, I'd better get home.
I gotta clear my schedule.

25:47.480 --> 25:48.946
Hailey, you don't have
to come with me.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.714
It's adorable that
you think that.

25:50.750 --> 25:51.882
They won't even let you
in the room.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.051
I am still a member of the bar,
and last time I checked,

25:54.086 --> 25:57.721
you are a civilian
in need of a lawyer.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.124
Right.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.993
It's very sweet of you to bring
me breakfast, Jonas.

26:03.029 --> 26:07.031
So, the calendar photo
shoot is tonight.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.399
[whispers] That's so exciting.

26:08.434 --> 26:11.602
You say exciting,
I say terrifying.

26:11.637 --> 26:12.870
Well, you don't need to worry.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.538
We've got a couple of minutes.

26:14.574 --> 26:17.308
Why don't you, uh, show me
what you've got.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.143
Go on, pose.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.344
Okay. I'm terrible.

26:20.379 --> 26:21.445
You're just overthinking it.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.582
Just relax your body,
be natural.

26:24.617 --> 26:25.916
[sighs]

26:25.952 --> 26:28.018
Yeah.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.153
Okay, great.

26:29.188 --> 26:32.022
And now, um, just act like you
just heard something.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.223
Like, "oh!"

26:33.259 --> 26:34.525
Put your hand on your hip.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.359
'Kay.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.760
No, not too, too, too much.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.963
Okay, and now look
at me and smile.

26:43.035 --> 26:45.035
Now that's a million-dollar
smile.

26:45.071 --> 26:46.503
[laughs]

26:46.539 --> 26:48.906
I only smile like this at you.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.674
Well then, I guess I'll have
to go to your photoshoot

26:50.710 --> 26:52.610
so you can smile
like this at me.

26:52.645 --> 26:53.711
[laughs]

26:53.746 --> 26:54.878
I would love that.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.048
I would love it too.

27:01.887 --> 27:03.420
Croissant?

27:03.456 --> 27:04.521
No thanks.

27:04.557 --> 27:06.624
When was the last time
you ate?

27:06.659 --> 27:08.692
I'm just not very hungry
right now.

27:08.728 --> 27:09.994
You wanna talk about it?

27:10.029 --> 27:10.861
Can I say no?

27:10.896 --> 27:12.196
Nope.

27:12.231 --> 27:15.132
What you thinkin'?

27:15.167 --> 27:19.136
One night in Iraq, we were
on a standard patrol.

27:19.171 --> 27:23.140
I saw this light flashing
in the distance,

27:23.175 --> 27:27.111
so I stepped away from
the patrol to investigate.

27:27.146 --> 27:33.083
I found myself pinned down
behind a rock under sniper fire.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.285
With a twisted ankle.

27:35.321 --> 27:39.556
I was stuck and alone.

27:39.592 --> 27:40.257
Fincher.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.226
I really thought I was a goner.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.762
But Kurt found me.

27:44.797 --> 27:48.198
And he dragged me outta there,
dodging bullets the whole time.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.867
It's a miracle you weren't hit.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.702
Yeah, I wasn't.

27:51.737 --> 27:54.605
Kurt took one in the chest.

27:54.640 --> 27:59.143
Luckily his vest kept the damage
down to a couple broken ribs.

28:01.647 --> 28:03.480
I had no idea.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.949
That's just what we did
for each other.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.352
Brothers for life.

28:08.387 --> 28:11.822
Thing is, Hailey, I knew
something was wrong.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.124
Which is why you offered
to help,

28:14.160 --> 28:16.627
and he called you to take you up
on that offer.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.896
I didn't get to help when
it mattered most.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.564
It still matters, Fincher.

28:20.599 --> 28:22.499
The truth always matters.

28:33.079 --> 28:35.079
<i> Fincher Garland to see</i>
<i> Sergeant Nesbit.</i>

28:35.114 --> 28:38.549
<i> Let him through.</i>

28:38.584 --> 28:40.818
<i> Thanks Sergeant.</i>

28:46.659 --> 28:48.992
I haven't been on a base
in a long time.

28:49.028 --> 28:50.260
Good memories?

28:50.296 --> 28:51.495
Yeah.

28:51.530 --> 28:52.396
My days in the Marine Corps

28:52.431 --> 28:53.897
were some of the best days
of my life.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.466
Why did you decide to leave?

28:55.501 --> 28:56.834
Oh, it was my time.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.502
I don't regret the way my life
has gone since,

28:58.537 --> 29:01.171
but you know, civilian
life suits me much better.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.339
The food alone.

29:02.374 --> 29:03.607
Oh, I thought military
food was good.

29:03.642 --> 29:04.708
[laughs]

29:04.744 --> 29:05.976
I have a very discerning
palate.

29:06.011 --> 29:07.745
And by discerning palate
you mean "add bacon."

29:07.780 --> 29:09.046
I love bacon.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.415
Private Cheryl Park.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.252
Mr. Garland.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.420
Thanks for coming.

29:16.455 --> 29:17.287
Happy to help.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.522
You been to Albany before?

29:18.557 --> 29:20.491
Ah, I did all my training
in Camp Bojurn.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.092
Ahh. I haven't been
there since basic.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.861
Seems like a lifetime ago.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.562
Another missing Marine.

29:25.598 --> 29:26.864
I hope you find her.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.565
We always do.

29:28.601 --> 29:29.867
Um, Ma'am, unfortunately,

29:29.902 --> 29:31.602
I'm gonna have to ask you
to wait in the lobby.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.737
We don't allow friends
in the interview.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.372
Oh. Well, she's not my friend.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.508
She's my lawyer.

29:37.543 --> 29:40.744
Oh. Well, in that case,
right this way, please.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.213
Let the record show that
my client, Fincher Garland,

29:43.249 --> 29:44.848
has come here of
his own volition.

29:44.884 --> 29:48.118
He made the four-hour drive
from Atlanta to assist you

29:48.154 --> 29:51.155
in your investigation
in any way he can.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.189
So, noted.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.558
We don't need to be so formal.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.827
Mr. Garland here is a former
US Marine,

29:56.862 --> 29:59.263
which means he's amongst family.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.764
Call me Fincher.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.699
All right, Fincher.

30:02.735 --> 30:04.868
Ah... you were the last person
to have a phone conversation

30:04.904 --> 30:06.670
with Staff Sergeant Cullen.

30:06.705 --> 30:08.639
You previously stated
it was to make plans

30:08.674 --> 30:10.507
for the following week.

30:10.543 --> 30:12.810
Was that all you guys
talked about?

30:12.845 --> 30:15.445
Pretty much.

30:15.481 --> 30:18.081
Well, this is just
a formality, but,

30:18.117 --> 30:20.484
uh, what were you doing
Monday night?

30:20.519 --> 30:23.587
I was home, alone.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.322
Do you own a gun?

30:25.357 --> 30:26.557
Yes.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.592
A Colt 45.

30:35.067 --> 30:39.102
Staff Sergeant Cullen was
not shot with a 45-caliber gun,

30:39.138 --> 30:41.872
but it was a handgun.

30:41.907 --> 30:44.208
I guess your "city"
medical examiner

30:44.243 --> 30:45.509
could tell you that much?

30:45.544 --> 30:47.911
Of course. It wasn't a 38,
that would be too small.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.112
Was it a 9 millimetre?

30:49.148 --> 30:50.614
[phone vibrates]

30:53.686 --> 30:55.853
Um... uh, you know, I can't
reveal details

30:55.888 --> 30:58.589
of an active investigation.

30:58.624 --> 31:01.425
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.298
His body language could
not have been more obvious.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.434
He believes Kurt was
shot with a 9 millimetre.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.336
You know, I knew I brought
you along for a good reason.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.238
Rattling off calibers
to see his reaction?

31:14.273 --> 31:17.474
That was genius.

31:17.509 --> 31:18.508
[whispers] Hailey!

31:18.544 --> 31:19.576
[whispers] What?

31:19.612 --> 31:21.178
It's not my fault he left
sensitive information

31:21.213 --> 31:22.312
in the room.

31:22.348 --> 31:23.947
He should know better.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.750
Okay, so these are Kurt's
phone records.

31:26.785 --> 31:28.852
It looks like you were
his last call, in or out.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.388
And then they've marked
Kayla and the base,

31:31.423 --> 31:32.923
and then there's some
unidentified number

31:32.958 --> 31:34.825
that he called several times,
but no answer.

31:34.860 --> 31:37.794
I'm gonna text it to Monty, see
if she can put a trace on it.

31:37.830 --> 31:38.929
They already would've
done that here.

31:38.964 --> 31:41.098
Probably, but do you think
they'd share that with us?

31:41.133 --> 31:42.499
No.

31:45.738 --> 31:47.504
Sorry for the interruption.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.477
You know, like I said outside,

31:53.512 --> 31:55.612
I'm happy to help
in any way I can.

31:55.648 --> 31:57.581
I bet I could be of more
assistance to you

31:57.616 --> 31:59.216
if you just tell me
what you know.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.984
I wish I could.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.453
Now, why don't you tell me
more about your time

32:03.489 --> 32:06.556
in the service with Staff
Sergeant Cullen?

32:08.661 --> 32:10.727
Mr. Garland, Ms. Dean.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.663
I heard you were on base today.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.731
I'm sorry you had to go through
an interrogation

32:14.767 --> 32:16.366
on top of everything.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.669
Well, I work in law enforcement
I know the drill.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.104
Well then, you also know that
our police are in control

32:21.140 --> 32:24.608
of the investigation,
and highly capable.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.944
Yeah, I do know that.

32:26.979 --> 32:31.481
Then, let's just leave them
to it.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.350
Happy to.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.852
I'm glad we understand
each other.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.357
Okay then.

32:46.899 --> 32:49.466
<i> So, so how are you feeling?</i>

32:49.501 --> 32:52.302
I'm relieved that I'm not really
a suspect anymore.

32:52.338 --> 32:53.971
It's the last thing I want
to deal with.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.706
I'm relieved, too.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.507
Uh, I'm glad we got a little
bit of information,

32:57.543 --> 33:01.311

we're so stuck.

to say that I'm sad,

Not... not yet.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.189
I get it.

33:12.224 --> 33:15.659
And when the sadness comes,
I will be there.

number from Kurt's cell record

33:22.568 --> 33:24.701
belongs to a burner phone.

33:24.737 --> 33:25.969
She can leave an open
trace on it,

33:26.005 --> 33:29.773
but if they get a hit, then they
have to tell the MPs right away.

33:29.808 --> 33:30.841
Yeah, we'll take it.

33:30.876 --> 33:33.677
Oh, that reminds me of something
I saw in the file.

33:33.712 --> 33:37.047
Kurt's cell phone was reset
to factory settings.

33:37.082 --> 33:38.715
He wiped his phone.

33:38.751 --> 33:40.183
But why?

33:40.219 --> 33:42.285
To delete whatever was on it,
I guess.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.920
But what was he trying
to get rid of?

33:43.956 --> 33:45.389
A secret email account?

33:45.424 --> 33:46.490
A video?

33:46.525 --> 33:47.591
A photo?

33:47.626 --> 33:48.892
Yeah, but there wasn't anything
at all in the cloud

33:48.927 --> 33:50.894

Well, if he was trying to hide
something,

36:18.043 --> 36:19.042
I'm just a little
shaken up.

36:19.077 --> 36:20.110
I'm so sorry.

36:20.145 --> 36:22.312
I should have never put you
in danger like that.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.515
Kayla, you didn't know.

36:25.551 --> 36:28.251
I sort of did.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.086
What do you mean?

36:32.124 --> 36:34.257
This was in the mail today.

36:34.293 --> 36:35.725
It's addressed to Kurt.

36:35.761 --> 36:39.663
Whoever sent this knows
where we live.

36:50.242 --> 36:53.910
would someone send Kurt
a threat days after his death?

36:53.946 --> 36:54.678
They didn't.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.979
It was postmarked
two weeks ago.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.113
Did it get held up?

36:57.149 --> 37:00.517
Well, if you look closely,
the house number's wrong.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.719
I sent a uniform out to canvas,

37:02.754 --> 37:05.555
and it seems it was
mis-delivered to the neighbour

37:05.591 --> 37:06.590
who was out of town.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.124
He only just got back yesterday.

and a mystery print.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.566
No match in AFIS.

37:16.602 --> 37:17.634
So it was a warning.

37:17.669 --> 37:18.602
Yeah.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.437
And the killer followed through.

37:20.472 --> 37:23.006
It's a theory, but the threat
doesn't give us any indication

37:23.041 --> 37:24.341
as to what Kurt did.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.009
Clearly it was meant for more
than one person.

37:26.044 --> 37:27.978
But do you think Kayla's
in danger?

37:28.013 --> 37:29.079
We don't know.

37:29.114 --> 37:30.714
So the car will stay out there

this man before?

38:09.354 --> 38:12.389
Is this who was outside
my house?

38:12.424 --> 38:15.425
Has anyone ever threatened Kurt?

38:15.460 --> 38:17.494
Not that I know of.

apologize for her husband.

38:32.644 --> 38:35.312
Apologize for what, exactly?

38:35.347 --> 38:39.549
She said now that Kurt took
the job her husband wanted,

38:39.584 --> 38:41.418
he was retiring.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.820

38:43.855 --> 38:47.924
I guess they had some kind
of argument at work.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.126
She was embarrassed, and I
didn't want to make her feel

38:50.162 --> 38:53.830
any worse, so... I didn't ask.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.299
But you asked Kurt about it.

this woman's name?

39:22.961 --> 39:26.162
Um... Jean Piscek.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.100
I just got off the phone
with Jean Piscek,

39:30.135 --> 39:32.035
she and her husband Martin
are separated,

39:32.070 --> 39:34.671
and she's living in Arizona now.

Martin's whereabouts

39:37.509 --> 39:39.843
Did she tell you what happened
between Martin and Kurt?

39:39.878 --> 39:40.910
Yeah.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.679
Apparently, when Kurt arrived
on his first day,

39:42.714 --> 39:43.880
Martin attacked him,

39:43.915 --> 39:45.782
saying that he had been waiting
years for that cushy post,

39:45.817 --> 39:48.051
and that Kurt was ruining
Martin's marriage.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.786
The MPs had to come
and restrain him.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.354
It was a pretty bad scene.

to me about what happened,

a call and see

45:41.673 --> 45:45.174
if they had space
for a local model.

45:45.210 --> 45:46.242
You didn't.

45:46.277 --> 45:47.243
[laughs]

45:47.278 --> 45:48.678
I mean, this seems to be
my 15 minutes of fame,

45:48.713 --> 45:49.979
I might as well take advantage.

45:50.014 --> 45:51.047
You know what's funny?

45:51.082 --> 45:52.181
I'm still a bit embarrassed.

45:52.217 --> 45:53.983
You're proud,
and you should be.

45:54.018 --> 45:56.252
The calendar's a hit,
it's great for the hospital,

45:56.287 --> 46:00.089
and besides, I kind of like
dating a celebrity model.

46:00.125 --> 46:01.824
It has perks that I wasn't
expecting.

46:01.860 --> 46:04.260
Oh, well then hold on, because
I plan on skipping the lineup

46:04.295 --> 46:05.828
at the coffee shop tomorrow.

46:05.864 --> 46:06.596
Oh!

46:06.631 --> 46:07.897
Oooh!

46:07.932 --> 46:09.499
[laughs]

46:11.402 --> 46:13.369
Uh... you know, when you said
you were bringing breakfast,

46:13.404 --> 46:14.604
I thought you meant bacon.

46:14.639 --> 46:17.173
This is leftover lasagna
from Mario's,

46:17.208 --> 46:19.776
and trust me, it is better
than bacon.

46:19.811 --> 46:20.743
Mario's?

46:20.779 --> 46:22.178
Megan has been trying
to get a reservation

46:22.213 --> 46:23.713
at this place for weeks.

46:23.748 --> 46:26.249
Mmhmmhmm.

46:26.284 --> 46:27.583
Mmm.

46:27.619 --> 46:28.885
Mmm!

46:28.920 --> 46:30.787
That is food truck good.

46:30.822 --> 46:31.988
Megan's gonna be so jealous.

46:32.023 --> 46:34.090
What can I say? My
boyfriend's famous.

46:34.125 --> 46:35.858
[laughs]

46:35.894 --> 46:37.794
You know what, Hailey?

46:37.829 --> 46:39.428
I'm so glad you have Jonas.

46:39.464 --> 46:41.130
Makes me worry about you
a lot less.

46:41.166 --> 46:42.398
Worry about me?

46:42.433 --> 46:45.401
I can't sleep for worrying
about you.

46:45.436 --> 46:46.569
I know.

46:46.604 --> 46:47.403
I'm sorry.

46:47.438 --> 46:48.671
No, no, you don't have
to be sorry.

46:48.706 --> 46:51.607
I will take all the sleepless
nights to have you in my life.

46:53.077 --> 46:54.443
See now, when you
talk like that,

46:54.479 --> 46:55.945
Hailey Dean, you're gonna
make me cry,

46:55.980 --> 46:57.280
and I'm not going to be able
to stop crying.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.314
You old softie.

46:58.349 --> 46:59.415
I have to go.

46:59.450 --> 47:03.219
I'm having coffee with Paulina
and I can't be late.

47:03.254 --> 47:04.453
[mimics explosion sound]

47:04.489 --> 47:05.788
[laughs]

47:06.691 --> 47:08.324
So how's life as a therapist?

47:08.359 --> 47:09.325
I love it.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.793
My life is so much calmer now.

47:10.829 --> 47:11.861
Calm?

47:11.896 --> 47:13.396
I don't even think that word's
in my vocabulary.

47:13.431 --> 47:15.064
Okay, level with me,
Paulina.

47:15.099 --> 47:15.998
Something's up.

47:16.034 --> 47:18.734
You always were perceptive.

47:18.770 --> 47:20.803
Do you remember
Clayton Morrel?

47:20.839 --> 47:22.438
My first time second
chairing for you,

47:22.473 --> 47:23.573
and my first murder trial.

47:23.608 --> 47:24.941
It's not one I will soon forget.

47:24.976 --> 47:27.343
Me neither, but for
different reasons.

47:27.378 --> 47:29.078
You took the plea,
it was the right call.

47:29.113 --> 47:31.180
For murder one
and a life sentence,

47:31.216 --> 47:35.484
to manslaughter plus 20 years,
eligible for parole in 10.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.553
And this is the 10th year
of his sentence.

47:37.589 --> 47:38.988
It'll hit the papers soon.

47:39.023 --> 47:41.123
I wanted you to hear it
from me first.

47:41.159 --> 47:42.792
Have you talked to the families?

47:42.827 --> 47:44.994
His is happy, of course.

47:45.029 --> 47:48.064
But Tamara's sister,
she hung up on me.

47:48.099 --> 47:49.765
Not that I blame her.

47:49.801 --> 47:53.236
Clayton murdered her sister
in cold blood in her own home,

47:53.271 --> 47:55.037
and now he's up for parole.

47:55.073 --> 47:57.073
She'll forgive you
when she's ready.

47:57.108 --> 47:59.008
I don't think she'll ever
forgive me.

47:59.043 --> 48:01.310
I kept a key witness
off the stand.

48:01.346 --> 48:02.178
The neighbour.

48:02.213 --> 48:03.112
He was drunk at the time.

48:03.147 --> 48:04.280
You wanted me to use him anyway.

48:04.315 --> 48:07.149
I should've listened to you
and not played it so safe.

48:07.185 --> 48:08.150
No way.

48:08.186 --> 48:09.852
You made the right call,
you got the conviction.

48:09.888 --> 48:11.654
You don't know that he'll be
granted parole.

48:11.689 --> 48:14.090
It's really what I wanted
to talk to you about.

48:14.125 --> 48:17.093
His parole hearing has been
set for next month.

48:17.128 --> 48:19.662
Will you testify against him?

48:19.697 --> 48:21.564
Of course.

48:21.599 --> 48:22.999
I'll have the case file
sent over.

48:23.034 --> 48:24.800
I really appreciate this,
Hailey.

48:24.836 --> 48:25.968
I may not work for you anymore,

48:26.004 --> 48:29.071
but I will always feel a
responsibility to my old cases.

48:29.107 --> 48:30.573
Even if I was only second chair.

48:30.608 --> 48:33.109
You were a rising star,
even then,

48:33.144 --> 48:36.846
and I chose you because I
knew you would make me better.

48:36.881 --> 48:39.448
I learned from the best.

48:39.484 --> 48:41.350
Well, I've got to get going,

48:41.386 --> 48:46.122
because the guilty do not
prosecute themselves.

48:46.157 --> 48:48.190
Paulina, call me anytime.

48:48.226 --> 48:49.425
I mean it.

48:49.460 --> 48:51.093
You know, this therapist thing?

48:51.129 --> 48:53.362
I get it.

48:53.398 --> 48:57.033
But I'm not convinced
it's really you.

48:58.503 --> 49:00.036
Bye.

49:02.340 --> 49:04.040
So I did some more digging
into the two suppliers.

49:04.075 --> 49:06.609
Turns out there was a complaint
against Greystone Foods Inc.

49:06.644 --> 49:09.578
from one of its workers, stating
unsafe working conditions.

49:09.614 --> 49:10.346
How so?

49:10.381 --> 49:11.447
I don't know.

49:11.482 --> 49:12.949
But the employee not only
rescinded the complaint,

49:12.984 --> 49:14.016
but refused to tell me why,

49:14.052 --> 49:16.786
saying that it was "all a big
misunderstanding."

49:16.821 --> 49:17.987
But get this.

49:18.022 --> 49:19.155
He doesn't work there anymore.

49:19.190 --> 49:22.758
Do you think he was paid off
to withdraw his complaint?

49:22.794 --> 49:25.561
You know, he did mention
a nondisclosure agreement.

49:25.596 --> 49:27.997
Well, then he's legally
prevented from saying anything,

49:28.032 --> 49:29.465
otherwise he could
be held liable

49:29.500 --> 49:30.967
for some huge amount
of money.

49:31.002 --> 49:32.601
Right, which all points
to a cover up.

49:32.637 --> 49:33.936
Do you think Kurt found out?

49:33.972 --> 49:36.672
Or, the unsafe conditions
still exist.

49:36.708 --> 49:39.275
Only Elisa Greystone wouldn't
be able to pay off a Marine

49:39.310 --> 49:40.643
like Kurt to keep quiet.

49:40.678 --> 49:41.744
Mm-mm.

49:41.779 --> 49:43.546
And we know that the Marines
are her only contract.

49:43.581 --> 49:46.248
Losing it would bankrupt
Greystone Foods.

49:51.255 --> 49:52.321
[sighs]

49:52.357 --> 49:53.422
You again.

49:53.458 --> 49:54.857
I'm just on my way out.

49:54.892 --> 49:56.192
Did you fail your
last inspection?

49:56.227 --> 49:56.993
Listen, I have to go.

49:57.028 --> 49:58.661
Miss Greystone,
you can understand

49:58.696 --> 49:59.996
how important it is that we know

50:00.031 --> 50:01.797
all the details surrounding

50:01.833 --> 50:04.133
Staff Sergeant
Cullen's final days.

50:04.168 --> 50:07.370
I'm sure the two of you were
able to discuss things.

50:07.405 --> 50:10.906
He didn't care how complicated
this business is.

50:10.942 --> 50:11.807
I know the type.

50:11.843 --> 50:12.775
[sighs]

50:12.810 --> 50:14.176
You want to explain
your side of the story,

50:14.212 --> 50:16.512
but he probably didn't
let you do that.

50:16.547 --> 50:17.880
Worse.

50:17.915 --> 50:20.416
He actually wrote me up.

50:20.451 --> 50:21.417
No.

50:21.452 --> 50:22.885
I'm sure that wasn't necessary.

50:22.920 --> 50:24.687
It wasn't.

50:24.722 --> 50:26.722
I had a small glitch
in my manufacturing.

50:26.758 --> 50:29.759
I caught it, I fixed it, it
really wasn't a big deal.

50:29.794 --> 50:31.827
But because the affected
shipment made it to the base

50:31.863 --> 50:32.995
before I could recall it,

50:33.031 --> 50:36.132
he said I was "non-compliant
with Marine regulations."

50:36.167 --> 50:39.001
He refused to listen
to me.

50:39.037 --> 50:40.336
That's awful.

50:40.371 --> 50:42.938
You must've been afraid
you'd lose the contract.

50:42.974 --> 50:45.574
Well, as you can see, it
didn't affect my business.

50:45.610 --> 50:47.977
I was able to handle it.

50:48.012 --> 50:50.679
I'm sorry, I really
do have to go.

51:00.958 --> 51:03.225
Hailey, there's a Marines
sticker on that license plate.

51:03.261 --> 51:04.827
So, she's dating someone
in the base.

51:04.862 --> 51:07.596
That would explain how she
managed to handle Kurt's report.

51:07.632 --> 51:09.565
She had someone disappear
it for her.

51:09.600 --> 51:10.866
But if she had an ally
on the base,

51:10.902 --> 51:13.235
then why did she need
Kurt dead?

51:13.271 --> 51:15.504
Unless her ally buried
Kurt's report

51:15.540 --> 51:17.373
because it was about to cause
him trouble, too.

51:17.408 --> 51:20.342
[phone rings]

51:20.378 --> 51:21.277
Hey, Monty.

51:21.312 --> 51:22.244
I was just about to call you.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.412
Can you run a license plate?

51:23.448 --> 51:25.714
[wearily] Uh,
it'll have to wait.

51:25.750 --> 51:26.749
<i> Where are you?</i>

51:26.784 --> 51:28.417
You know that burner phone
we've been tracing?

51:28.453 --> 51:30.052
The one Kurt's been calling?

51:30.088 --> 51:31.887
You found it?

51:31.923 --> 51:32.922
[sighs]

51:32.957 --> 51:36.225
On the body of a woman
who was shot in the park.

51:38.729 --> 51:39.962
got a hit on the cell phone

51:39.997 --> 51:41.063
when it powered up
for a few minutes,

51:41.099 --> 51:43.365
and we traced it to a teenager
who said he found it

51:43.401 --> 51:45.568
about a hundred yards from here.

51:45.603 --> 51:47.870
Since it was the same park
where we found Kurt's body,

51:47.905 --> 51:49.672
we got the dogs out,
and within an hour,

51:49.707 --> 51:51.440
we found this Jane Doe.

51:51.476 --> 51:54.677
No identification on the body,
nothing in her clothing,

51:54.712 --> 51:57.613
no keys, no money, no jewelry.

51:57.648 --> 51:58.714
Just like Kurt.

51:58.749 --> 52:00.683
You think it's the same killer?

52:00.718 --> 52:02.017
It's too early to say.

52:02.053 --> 52:03.552
And without Kurt's
full autopsy report,

52:03.588 --> 52:06.856
we can only speculate, but I
am leaning in that direction.

52:06.891 --> 52:09.225
Do you have to tell the Marines?

52:09.260 --> 52:11.594
No, without an identity,
she's a civilian Jane Doe.

52:11.629 --> 52:13.229
She was found in
our jurisdiction,

52:13.264 --> 52:15.297
so that makes it Atlanta
PD's investigation.

52:15.333 --> 52:16.132
For now.

52:16.167 --> 52:17.199
Fincher.

52:17.235 --> 52:19.101
I know you're not gonna
want to hear this, but...

52:19.137 --> 52:22.605
I think that we need
to look at Kayla first.

52:22.640 --> 52:23.772
Why?

52:23.808 --> 52:26.075
She was convinced that Kurt
was seeing another woman.

52:26.110 --> 52:29.578
We found a woman communicating
with him in the same park.

52:29.614 --> 52:32.515
We have to at least ask her
the question.

52:38.322 --> 52:40.122
Do you have a gun?

52:40.158 --> 52:41.590
No.

52:41.626 --> 52:44.026
Kurt does... he did.

52:44.061 --> 52:47.429
Um, uh, a Glock, I think.

52:47.465 --> 52:49.198
<i>Whatever his service weapon was,</i>

52:49.233 --> 52:51.500
he bought the same one
to keep at home.

52:51.536 --> 52:53.302
A 9 millimetre?

52:53.337 --> 52:54.436
If you say so.

52:54.472 --> 52:56.172
Where is it now?

52:56.207 --> 52:59.608
It was in our lock box,
but the Marine MPs took it.

53:03.447 --> 53:05.214
You know this woman?

53:09.253 --> 53:11.187
This is her, isn't it?

53:11.222 --> 53:12.588
"Her" who?

53:12.623 --> 53:16.492
The woman my husband was seeing
behind my back.

53:16.527 --> 53:18.360
You met her?

53:18.396 --> 53:20.963
You're showing me the photo
of a young woman.

53:20.998 --> 53:22.898
Who else would it be?

53:22.934 --> 53:26.835
So you've never seen her before?

53:26.871 --> 53:28.404
No.

53:28.439 --> 53:29.905
[keyboard clicks]

53:29.941 --> 53:32.141
[tape rewind noise]

53:32.176 --> 53:34.610
<i> So you've never seen</i>
<i> her before?</i>

53:36.180 --> 53:37.680
No.

53:37.715 --> 53:39.582
She looked to the side.

53:39.617 --> 53:42.351
A sign that she was trying
to access a memory.

53:42.386 --> 53:44.453
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
that Kayla killed her.

53:44.488 --> 53:46.255
No.

53:46.290 --> 53:48.023
We don't know
who she is, either.

53:48.059 --> 53:50.759
Then why are you associating
her with my husband?

53:50.795 --> 53:54.196
We found her cell phone with
your husband's number on it.

53:54.232 --> 53:58.534
And we found her body in the
same park as your husband.

53:58.569 --> 54:01.604
We believe that they were killed
by the same person.

54:03.608 --> 54:05.908
And you think I did it.

54:05.943 --> 54:07.142
[keyboard clicks]

54:07.178 --> 54:08.944
[tape rewind noise]

54:08.980 --> 54:10.846
And you think I did it.

54:13.417 --> 54:15.517
Did you?

54:15.553 --> 54:17.386
Does it matter what I say?

54:20.358 --> 54:22.124
Kayla can't be guilty.

54:22.159 --> 54:24.360
I just don't believe that she
would kill her own husband.

54:24.395 --> 54:26.996
Kayla didn't hide her anger
that she feels toward

54:27.031 --> 54:28.697
our Jane Doe.

54:28.733 --> 54:31.033
Fincher, jealousy
can be very powerful.

54:31.068 --> 54:34.903
I know, I know, I have seen it
just as many times as you have.

54:34.939 --> 54:37.906
Look, what about the man you
ran into outside Kayla's house?

54:37.942 --> 54:38.841
Or the threatening note?

54:38.876 --> 54:40.276
Kayla didn't send it to herself.

54:40.311 --> 54:42.077
You're right, and there are
a lot of questions

54:42.113 --> 54:44.079
that she doesn't
have the answers to.

54:44.115 --> 54:46.282
But if the MPs can match
ballistics to the gun found

54:46.317 --> 54:47.116
in Kayla's house,

54:47.151 --> 54:48.984
they would have arrested her
already.

54:49.020 --> 54:51.086
No, we can't assume that,
Fincher.

54:51.122 --> 54:53.722
Uh, it's true that we can't
tie Kayla to our Jane Doe.

54:53.758 --> 54:57.226
She has motive but so far,
no opportunity.

54:57.261 --> 54:58.060
We have to let her go.

54:58.095 --> 54:59.862
But Fincher?

54:59.897 --> 55:02.031
She's still a suspect.

55:06.437 --> 55:07.770
You recognize her,
though.

55:07.805 --> 55:11.140
Uh, yeah I may have seen
her before.

55:11.175 --> 55:13.108
Can you remember where
you saw her?

55:13.144 --> 55:14.543
Well, I spend most
of my time here,

55:14.578 --> 55:16.178
but she doesn't work for me.

55:16.213 --> 55:19.381
Uh, I'll think about it.

55:19.417 --> 55:21.283
So, the Marines,
they're letting you assist

55:21.319 --> 55:22.851
on their investigation?

55:22.887 --> 55:24.353
We're, uh, working
a different case.

55:24.388 --> 55:27.556
So, the Staff Sergeant
Cullen case, is it closed?

55:27.591 --> 55:28.891
Far from it.

55:28.926 --> 55:30.392
Any closer to finding
the killer?

55:30.428 --> 55:31.460
It's kind of you to ask,

55:31.495 --> 55:33.329
but we can't talk about
an ongoing investigation.

55:33.364 --> 55:35.397
Oh, of course not.
My apologies.

55:35.433 --> 55:37.966
It's quieter here than it
was the other day.

55:38.002 --> 55:40.202
Yeah, you know,
it comes in waves.

55:40.237 --> 55:41.637
Big shipment comes in,
it's hectic,

55:41.672 --> 55:44.573
then we just kinda wait
for the next one.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.743
Mexico.

55:47.778 --> 55:49.912
You supply kitchens all over.

55:49.947 --> 55:52.915
Well, it's a living.

55:54.952 --> 55:56.151
Thank you.

55:56.187 --> 55:57.820
Thanks a lot.

55:58.356 --> 56:01.056
I'm not sure what this has
to do with me.

56:01.092 --> 56:02.358
Why are you here again?

56:02.393 --> 56:04.059
Take a look at this photograph.

56:04.095 --> 56:05.994
Do you know this woman?

56:06.030 --> 56:07.896
No.

56:07.932 --> 56:09.765
You don't sound certain.

56:10.668 --> 56:14.570
Maybe I've seen her before,
but I couldn't say where or why.

56:14.605 --> 56:16.405
Do you know her name?

56:16.440 --> 56:18.273
I don't think so.

56:18.309 --> 56:21.009
Next time you have a question
for me,

56:21.045 --> 56:23.245
call my lawyer.

56:26.617 --> 56:28.083
Bye.

56:30.855 --> 56:31.954
Good timing.

56:31.989 --> 56:33.889
Jonas is on his way in to give
a full autopsy report

56:33.924 --> 56:34.990
on our Jane Doe.

56:35.025 --> 56:37.059
Still no identifying her,
though.

56:37.094 --> 56:39.495
Well, both contractors
recognized our Jane Doe,

56:39.530 --> 56:40.763
but neither knew her name.

56:40.798 --> 56:43.766
You think Kurt ever brought her
along on any of his inspections?

56:43.801 --> 56:45.634
Mm. That'd be against protocol.

56:45.669 --> 56:46.568
Kurt was a stickler.

56:46.604 --> 56:47.803
Well...

56:47.838 --> 56:49.338
Neither of the fingerprints
matched the threatening note,

56:49.373 --> 56:51.106
so that's a dead end.

56:51.142 --> 56:53.642
What about the license plate
of the car that Elisa got into?

56:53.677 --> 56:54.610
Ahh, yes.

56:54.645 --> 56:57.479
The car belonged to a Lieutenant
Chris Young,

56:57.515 --> 56:58.814
US Marine Corps.

56:58.849 --> 57:01.817
So Elisa is dating
Lieutenant Young?

57:01.852 --> 57:04.787
Exactly the right man to get rid
of a negative inspection report.

57:04.822 --> 57:08.090
What if Kurt found out that
Lieutenant Young tampered with

57:08.125 --> 57:10.225
the report and was giving
preferential treatment

57:10.261 --> 57:11.760
to a substandard supplier?

57:11.796 --> 57:13.095
Well, that's definitely
something that Young

57:13.130 --> 57:14.363
would want to keep secret.

57:14.398 --> 57:15.731
[applause]

57:15.766 --> 57:18.634
[cheerfully]

57:18.669 --> 57:19.635
Jonas.

57:19.670 --> 57:20.469
Hey, Monty.

57:20.504 --> 57:21.703
Will you sign this please?

57:21.739 --> 57:22.638
Um, yeah, okay.

57:22.673 --> 57:24.239
Her name's Beverly.

57:24.275 --> 57:25.240
<i> [phone rings]</i>

57:25.276 --> 57:26.308
Oh, uh, that's the lab.

57:26.343 --> 57:27.743
I'll be right back, you get
started without me,

57:27.778 --> 57:29.278
and Jonas, thank you.

57:29.313 --> 57:30.913
My mom will be the talk
of bingo night.

57:30.948 --> 57:33.449
So, um, autopsy?

57:33.484 --> 57:34.817
Yes, Jane Doe.

57:34.852 --> 57:37.286
Uh, she was killed around
12 days ago.

57:37.321 --> 57:39.521
The recent cold snap kept her
body well preserved,

57:39.557 --> 57:41.123
but I'm confident on the timing.

57:41.158 --> 57:43.091
So, she was killed three days
before Kurt.

57:43.127 --> 57:45.427
So Kurt hadn't heard
from her for a while.

57:45.463 --> 57:46.595
That's why he kept
checking his phone.

57:46.630 --> 57:47.796
He was worried about her.

57:47.832 --> 57:48.864
The bullet was 9 millimetre.

57:48.899 --> 57:51.099
She was shot at close range
in the right temple.

57:51.135 --> 57:52.034
Just like Kurt.

57:52.069 --> 57:52.968
Yes, the similarities

57:53.003 --> 57:54.736
between the victims are
definitely there.

57:54.772 --> 57:56.038
[exhales]

57:56.073 --> 57:57.306
Well, we might have something.

57:57.341 --> 57:59.975
The lab finished restoring the
cell phone from our Jane Doe,

58:00.010 --> 58:01.743
the only number it ever called
was Kurt's,

58:01.779 --> 58:04.480
and the only message on it was
an email addressed

58:04.515 --> 58:08.050
to an account, um...
Semperfi@senderout.com.

58:08.085 --> 58:10.052
It's a web-based email server.

58:10.087 --> 58:11.453
We're getting
the account records.

58:11.489 --> 58:12.788
"Semper fi."

58:12.823 --> 58:14.857
It's the Marines' motto,
it means "always loyal."

58:14.892 --> 58:17.059
Kurt's private secret account.

58:17.094 --> 58:20.329
And the subject line of
the email said "the proof."

58:20.364 --> 58:22.297
The proof of what?

58:22.333 --> 58:26.401
And that is our Jane Doe.

58:26.437 --> 58:28.437
She sent Kurt a photo
of herself.

58:28.472 --> 58:29.872
She's a Marine.

58:29.907 --> 58:33.141
Private First Class,
from the looks of it.

58:33.177 --> 58:35.077
Name's Park.

58:35.112 --> 58:38.680
As in... Private Cheryl Park?

58:38.716 --> 58:40.382
Why does that name
sound familiar?

58:40.417 --> 58:42.384
That flyer we saw on
the base...

58:42.419 --> 58:47.022
Sergeant Nesbit told us
she's AWOL.

58:47.057 --> 58:49.291
He said the same
thing about Kurt.

58:56.901 --> 59:00.569
Private Park's only living
relative is her dad, Sam Park.

59:02.473 --> 59:03.972
Hey, you.

59:06.243 --> 59:07.175
You know each other?

59:07.211 --> 59:08.677
Yeah, this is the guy
who knocked me down

59:08.712 --> 59:09.711
at Kayla's house.

59:09.747 --> 59:10.879
This is the man we're
looking for.

59:10.915 --> 59:12.281
Really?

59:12.316 --> 59:14.349
[tense music]

59:17.655 --> 59:19.187
Has Mr. Park said anything?

59:19.223 --> 59:20.923
Did he explain what
he was doing?

59:20.958 --> 59:22.691
No. Not yet.

59:22.726 --> 59:24.092
I'm waiting for the
fingerprint results

59:24.128 --> 59:25.861
from the threatening note.

59:25.896 --> 59:31.733
[computer beeps]

59:31.769 --> 59:34.703
It's a match.

59:34.738 --> 59:36.371
I better get in there.

59:38.742 --> 59:41.543
<i> I'm very sorry to have</i>
<i> to tell you this Mr. Park,</i>

59:41.579 --> 59:45.280
but we found your daughter's
body in Piercedale Park.

59:50.754 --> 59:53.555
I knew she was dead.

59:53.591 --> 59:55.624
How'd you know?

59:58.729 --> 1:00:00.529
[clears throat]

1:00:00.564 --> 1:00:02.764
Where'd you get this photo?

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:05.601
Does it have a special
significance to you?

1:00:07.571 --> 1:00:10.939
No. I've never seen it before.

1:00:10.975 --> 1:00:12.074
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:14.409
I know this is a lot to process.

1:00:14.445 --> 1:00:17.813
But we need to ask you
some questions.

1:00:19.750 --> 1:00:22.918
<i> Did you know Staff</i>
<i> Sergeant Cullen?</i>

1:00:22.953 --> 1:00:24.753
[exhales]

1:00:24.788 --> 1:00:26.755
No, not personally.

1:00:26.790 --> 1:00:29.291
What were you doing outside
his house last week?

1:00:36.367 --> 1:00:39.668
Have you ever seen this before?

1:00:39.703 --> 1:00:41.303
Uh, no.

1:00:41.338 --> 1:00:43.138
So you weren't trying
to get it back?

1:00:43.173 --> 1:00:45.107
[harshly] No.

1:00:45.142 --> 1:00:47.776
<i> Mr. Park, we found</i>
<i> your fingerprints on it.</i>

1:00:51.115 --> 1:00:53.015
Okay, I sent him the letter.

1:00:53.050 --> 1:00:55.751
But then I heard on the news
that he was found dead.

1:00:55.786 --> 1:00:57.653
I knew what that was gonna
look like.

1:00:57.688 --> 1:01:01.456
So, but hey, I didn't kill him.

1:01:01.492 --> 1:01:05.994
I just wanted some justice
for my daughter.

1:01:06.030 --> 1:01:08.030
And you think Kurt Cullen
was responsible

1:01:08.065 --> 1:01:09.498
for what happened to her?

1:01:09.533 --> 1:01:11.299
I don't know.

1:01:13.303 --> 1:01:16.238
Three weeks ago she calls me.

1:01:16.273 --> 1:01:18.840
She's scared, she's nervous.

1:01:18.876 --> 1:01:22.744
She said she'd found something
that she shouldn't have found.

1:01:22.780 --> 1:01:25.747
She kept going on about buying
a prepaid phone,

1:01:25.783 --> 1:01:29.885
so it couldn't be traced
back to her.

1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:33.288
I told her to go to your
superior officer,

1:01:33.323 --> 1:01:35.557
Staff Sergeant Cullen.

1:01:35.592 --> 1:01:37.292
What did she find?

1:01:39.630 --> 1:01:44.199
Whatever she found
got her killed.

1:01:46.503 --> 1:01:49.604
He's having a lot of feelings
right now, understandably.

1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:51.239
I believed his explanations.

1:01:51.275 --> 1:01:52.040
Me too.

1:01:52.076 --> 1:01:53.208
I don't know where
to go from here.

1:01:53.243 --> 1:01:56.845
We have no evidence linking
Sam Park to Kurt's murder,

1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:59.081
and I can't see him killing
his own daughter.

1:01:59.116 --> 1:02:02.484
And now, I have to turn Cheryl
Park's body over to the MPs.

1:02:02.519 --> 1:02:04.386
The case is no longer ours
to pursue.

1:02:04.421 --> 1:02:05.921
Monty, you've gotta stall 'em?

1:02:05.956 --> 1:02:07.756
If something is going on over
at that base,

1:02:07.791 --> 1:02:08.657
and we have to find out what

1:02:08.692 --> 1:02:10.125
before they sweep it
all under the rug.

1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:11.293
Okay, let's go over this again.

1:02:11.328 --> 1:02:14.296
So we have a private who
works at a distribution centre.

1:02:14.331 --> 1:02:16.732
She tells her father she found
something she shouldn't have.

1:02:16.767 --> 1:02:18.433
Yeah, she trusted Kurt enough
to send him a photo.

1:02:18.469 --> 1:02:20.769
Which somehow is the proof
of what she found.

1:02:20.804 --> 1:02:22.771
It just looks like a photo
she took at work.

1:02:22.806 --> 1:02:24.973
I will have forensics do a full
work up on the photo.

1:02:25.008 --> 1:02:27.175
Maybe there's more to it
than meets the eye.

1:02:28.579 --> 1:02:29.711
Jonas, thanks for cancelling
the restaurant,

1:02:29.747 --> 1:02:32.614
I just wasn't in the mood for
something fancy tonight.

1:02:32.649 --> 1:02:35.150
No, I know you're
worried about Fincher.

1:02:35.185 --> 1:02:37.119
There's just not
much I can do for him.

1:02:37.154 --> 1:02:41.056
Hailey, you're doing a lot
just by being there for him.

1:02:41.091 --> 1:02:44.326
[phone rings]

1:02:44.361 --> 1:02:45.460
[groans]

1:02:45.496 --> 1:02:46.862
Sorry about that.

1:02:46.897 --> 1:02:48.830
I do have some good news.

1:02:48.866 --> 1:02:51.767
The hospital has raised...
ready...

1:02:51.802 --> 1:02:54.936
$25,000 from the calendar.

1:02:54.972 --> 1:02:56.037
And that is just so far.

1:02:56.073 --> 1:02:57.205
That's incredible.

1:02:57.241 --> 1:02:59.908
[phone notification]

1:02:59.943 --> 1:03:03.044
So, I wanted to thank you
for convincing me to do it.

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:04.713
Well, the hospital getting
the support it needs

1:03:04.748 --> 1:03:05.814
is thanks enough.

1:03:05.849 --> 1:03:07.015
[phone rings]

1:03:07.050 --> 1:03:08.216
I'm sorry, I'll just
turn this off.

1:03:08.252 --> 1:03:09.284
You can't turn it off.

1:03:09.319 --> 1:03:10.752
What if work needs you?

1:03:10.788 --> 1:03:11.720
Oh, right.

1:03:11.755 --> 1:03:13.088
[exhales]

1:03:13.123 --> 1:03:14.689
What's going on?

1:03:14.725 --> 1:03:15.690
[sighs]

1:03:15.726 --> 1:03:17.726
It's nothing, I just... I keep
getting calls

1:03:17.761 --> 1:03:20.595
from the local news
asking for an interview.

1:03:20.631 --> 1:03:21.530
Because of the calendar?

1:03:21.565 --> 1:03:23.098
I keep telling them
to interview Megan,

1:03:23.133 --> 1:03:24.299
but they won't stop calling.

1:03:24.334 --> 1:03:27.469
Hi, um, could I take a photo
with you?

1:03:27.504 --> 1:03:28.370
Oh, I don't...

1:03:28.405 --> 1:03:29.771
We're kind of having
a private dinner.

1:03:29.807 --> 1:03:32.174
No, no, of course,
it'll only take a second.

1:03:32.209 --> 1:03:33.608
[laughs]

1:03:37.447 --> 1:03:39.381
I'm Jonas. Hi.

1:03:39.416 --> 1:03:40.515
[photo snaps]

1:03:40.551 --> 1:03:41.416
There you go.

1:03:41.451 --> 1:03:42.217
[giggles]

1:03:42.252 --> 1:03:43.018
Thank you!

1:03:43.053 --> 1:03:44.019
[laughs]

1:03:44.054 --> 1:03:45.320
Wow.

1:03:45.355 --> 1:03:47.522
It's incredible, she interrupts
our dinner

1:03:47.558 --> 1:03:49.791
and doesn't even apologize.

1:03:49.827 --> 1:03:51.126
Hmm.

1:03:51.161 --> 1:03:52.294
I am so sorry.

1:03:52.329 --> 1:03:54.663
Let's just eat.

1:03:54.698 --> 1:03:55.997
'Kay.

1:03:57.201 --> 1:03:57.966
So, we got lucky.

1:03:58.001 --> 1:03:59.000
The burner had GPS

1:03:59.036 --> 1:04:01.203
and the location services
weren't turned off.

1:04:01.238 --> 1:04:03.672
We have a record of everywhere
that Cheryl went

1:04:03.707 --> 1:04:05.006
on the day that she died.

1:04:05.042 --> 1:04:05.941
We're ready.

1:04:05.976 --> 1:04:06.875
Right.

1:04:06.910 --> 1:04:08.577
She started in Albany,
on base I presume,

1:04:08.612 --> 1:04:10.612
and then she drove all the way
here to Atlanta,

1:04:10.647 --> 1:04:13.415
arriving around 5:00 PM.

1:04:13.450 --> 1:04:14.783
So, she drove straight through.

1:04:14.818 --> 1:04:15.851
Yeah, it looks that way.

1:04:15.886 --> 1:04:18.753
Then she hung out in a coffee
shop for a while.

1:04:18.789 --> 1:04:19.921
She called Kurt several times

1:04:19.957 --> 1:04:22.023
but he never answered
any of them.

1:04:22.059 --> 1:04:23.358
I wonder why.

1:04:23.393 --> 1:04:26.895
Then, at 8:00 PM,
she went to the park.

1:04:26.930 --> 1:04:28.029
Where she was killed.

1:04:28.065 --> 1:04:29.030
Did you find the car?

1:04:29.066 --> 1:04:31.199
No, but if the killer wanted her
to disappear,

1:04:31.235 --> 1:04:33.535
I wouldn't be surprised if it
was sold to a chop shop

1:04:33.570 --> 1:04:35.971
and its parts spread all over
the country by now.

1:04:36.006 --> 1:04:36.905
[sighs]

1:04:36.940 --> 1:04:37.806
So, what now?

1:04:37.841 --> 1:04:39.007
Probably nothing.

1:04:39.042 --> 1:04:41.810
The brass upstairs made me call
the Marines this morning.

1:04:41.845 --> 1:04:44.212
The MPs are coming by later
today to pick up the body

1:04:44.248 --> 1:04:46.381
and the files.

1:04:46.416 --> 1:04:47.582
So soon?

1:04:47.618 --> 1:04:48.984
I don't know how much further
we could've gotten

1:04:49.019 --> 1:04:51.453
without access to Kurt's files,
anyway.

1:04:51.488 --> 1:04:52.821
I'm really sorry, you guys.

1:04:52.856 --> 1:04:54.256
Okay.

1:04:56.560 --> 1:04:57.459
You need to eat.

1:04:57.494 --> 1:04:59.661
Everything looks better on
a full stomach.

1:04:59.696 --> 1:05:01.363
Sounds like a plan.

1:05:01.398 --> 1:05:03.598
Oh, we'd like to place an order.

1:05:03.634 --> 1:05:04.933
You two can read, correct?

1:05:04.968 --> 1:05:07.836
See, "sorry, we're
on a break."

1:05:07.871 --> 1:05:09.404
Uh, did George sell the truck?

1:05:09.439 --> 1:05:11.840
He's having his tonsils removed,
I'm filling in...

1:05:11.875 --> 1:05:13.108
right after my break.

1:05:13.143 --> 1:05:15.410
Well, could you do one order
really, really fast?

1:05:15.445 --> 1:05:16.478
Please?

1:05:16.513 --> 1:05:17.679
You're not gonna give up,
are you?

1:05:17.714 --> 1:05:18.613
Okay, what do you want?

1:05:18.649 --> 1:05:20.248
What'll it be?

1:05:20.284 --> 1:05:21.449
What do you recommend?

1:05:21.485 --> 1:05:24.819
Okay, read off the menu. I
recommend you order from there.

1:05:24.855 --> 1:05:25.587
You know what?

1:05:25.622 --> 1:05:27.155
Let me make it
easy for you two.

1:05:27.190 --> 1:05:29.858
How about pulled pork, right?

1:05:29.893 --> 1:05:30.926
A plain pig.

1:05:30.961 --> 1:05:32.260
It's meat on a bun.

1:05:32.296 --> 1:05:33.895
People love it.

1:05:33.931 --> 1:05:36.765
Uh, yeah, you know, I'm gonna
go with the bacon burger.

1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:38.700
Out of bacon.

1:05:38.735 --> 1:05:40.001
Uh... Chilli cheese dog?

1:05:40.037 --> 1:05:41.603
Out of chilli, out of cheese.

1:05:41.638 --> 1:05:43.071
Out of dog?

1:05:44.374 --> 1:05:45.140
Sorry.

1:05:45.175 --> 1:05:46.241
You know what?

1:05:46.276 --> 1:05:46.942
We'll just take two of whatever
you want to give us.

1:05:46.977 --> 1:05:49.277
Two plain pigs. You'll love it.

1:05:49.313 --> 1:05:49.978
Here you go.

1:05:50.013 --> 1:05:51.713
Thank you. I'll keep the tip.

1:05:51.748 --> 1:05:52.547
Here you go.

1:05:52.582 --> 1:05:53.415
Buh-bye.

1:05:53.450 --> 1:05:55.050
Bye.

1:05:57.287 --> 1:05:58.186
Looks edible.

1:05:58.221 --> 1:06:01.356
That's not exactly a ringing
endorsement.

1:06:01.391 --> 1:06:03.325
Hot sauce for your thoughts?

1:06:03.360 --> 1:06:03.892
[sighs]

1:06:03.927 --> 1:06:05.126
I don't know, Hailey.

1:06:05.162 --> 1:06:06.227
Just as we start getting close,

1:06:06.263 --> 1:06:09.130
the Marines show up and take
everything away again.

1:06:09.166 --> 1:06:10.432
You're not giving up, are you?

1:06:10.467 --> 1:06:11.333
No, no, no.

1:06:11.368 --> 1:06:14.235
I just don't know where
to go from here.

1:06:14.271 --> 1:06:16.404
Okay, let's look at what
we might be missing.

1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:20.608
So, is there any way to connect
Cheryl to Elisa Greystone.

1:06:20.644 --> 1:06:21.776
We already know she had
something to hide.

1:06:21.812 --> 1:06:23.478
Maybe it's bigger than
we expected.

1:06:23.513 --> 1:06:25.046
She's dating Lieutenant Young.

1:06:25.082 --> 1:06:27.482
He can influence who gets
contracts and bury reports

1:06:27.517 --> 1:06:28.917
if he wants to.

1:06:28.952 --> 1:06:30.618
Do you think he would kill
two people

1:06:30.654 --> 1:06:33.555
to keep his girlfriend's
business afloat?

1:06:33.590 --> 1:06:35.757
People have killed
for a lot less.

1:06:38.462 --> 1:06:39.494
Sergeant Nesbit?

1:06:39.529 --> 1:06:40.562
Miss Dean.

1:06:40.597 --> 1:06:42.130
Here to take over the Cheryl
Park case I assume?

1:06:42.165 --> 1:06:45.033
No, actually, I'm here to work
on it together.

1:06:45.068 --> 1:06:46.001
And for the record,
if it were up to me,

1:06:46.036 --> 1:06:48.203
I would've been working
with you all along.

1:06:48.238 --> 1:06:49.204
I appreciate that.

1:06:49.239 --> 1:06:51.072
When Detective Montgomery called
me to fill me in

1:06:51.108 --> 1:06:52.207
about Private Park,

1:06:52.242 --> 1:06:53.708
I remembered
an incident that happened

1:06:53.744 --> 1:06:55.076
the day she went AWOL.

1:06:55.112 --> 1:06:56.444
You mean when she was murdered.

1:06:56.480 --> 1:06:57.712
Yeah.

1:06:57.748 --> 1:07:01.683
Here's Cheryl leaving the base
at 1:00 PM on Thursday the 11th.

1:07:01.718 --> 1:07:02.650
That's nothing unusual,

1:07:02.686 --> 1:07:05.153
she could've been going
off base for lunch.

1:07:05.188 --> 1:07:07.355
But then...

1:07:07.391 --> 1:07:08.857
It's Kayla.

1:07:11.261 --> 1:07:14.696
That does not look like
a pleasant conversation.

1:07:27.544 --> 1:07:29.044
Kayla hasn't been
honest with us.

1:07:29.079 --> 1:07:30.979
What else is she hiding?

1:07:31.014 --> 1:07:33.314
But she doesn't
fit the evidence.

1:07:33.350 --> 1:07:35.450
She has motive, Fincher.

1:07:35.485 --> 1:07:37.318
Strong motive.

1:07:41.224 --> 1:07:43.425
We have video footage of you
confronting Cheryl

1:07:43.460 --> 1:07:45.093
at the Marine base.

1:07:45.128 --> 1:07:46.895
So you do know her.

1:07:49.132 --> 1:07:52.200
No, no, I don't.

1:07:52.235 --> 1:07:55.070
Why did you suspect that she was
seeing your husband?

1:07:55.105 --> 1:07:57.839
I followed him a couple
of weeks ago.

1:07:57.874 --> 1:08:01.109
He went to a hotel, and I
saw him meet that woman

1:08:01.144 --> 1:08:02.210
in the lobby.

1:08:02.245 --> 1:08:04.345
And you assumed the worst.

1:08:04.381 --> 1:08:06.314
Wouldn't you?

1:08:06.349 --> 1:08:10.018
Did you say anything to anyone
about what you suspected?

1:08:10.053 --> 1:08:11.886
I asked Kurt.

1:08:11.922 --> 1:08:13.655
I told him I saw him
with another woman.

1:08:13.690 --> 1:08:16.157
All he said was "it was better
for me not to know."

1:08:16.193 --> 1:08:19.127
I mean, what kinda
answer was that?

1:08:19.162 --> 1:08:22.464
[tape rewinds]

1:08:22.499 --> 1:08:24.632
All he said was "it was better
for me not to know."

1:08:24.668 --> 1:08:27.769
What kinda answer was that?

1:08:27.804 --> 1:08:29.838
So you thought that you would
go to Private Park

1:08:29.873 --> 1:08:31.973
and get your answers.

1:08:32.008 --> 1:08:34.142
Walk me through what happened
that day.

1:08:34.177 --> 1:08:35.543
You went to base...

1:08:35.579 --> 1:08:37.512
I waited at the gate.

1:08:37.547 --> 1:08:40.115
For hours.

1:08:40.150 --> 1:08:43.318
And I was about to give up...
when I saw her.

1:08:43.353 --> 1:08:44.519
You confronted her.

1:08:44.554 --> 1:08:46.254
Did she confirm your suspicions?

1:08:46.289 --> 1:08:48.790
She kept telling me to mind
my own business

1:08:48.825 --> 1:08:50.792
if I knew what was best for me.

1:08:50.827 --> 1:08:52.060
And that made you angry.

1:08:52.095 --> 1:08:53.294
Of course it made me angry.

1:08:53.330 --> 1:08:55.830
So angry that you followed her
all the way back to Atlanta

1:08:55.866 --> 1:08:57.932
that same day.

1:08:57.968 --> 1:08:59.200
N-no.

1:08:59.236 --> 1:09:01.236
<i> And then maybe you heard</i>
<i> her calling Kurt.</i>

1:09:01.271 --> 1:09:02.470
<i> Or maybe you were at home</i>

1:09:02.506 --> 1:09:04.405
<i> arguing with him</i>
<i> when she called.</i>

1:09:04.441 --> 1:09:05.440
You confronted her again.

1:09:05.475 --> 1:09:08.243
You hit her, then you dragged
her to the park,

1:09:08.278 --> 1:09:09.277
and you shot her.

1:09:09.312 --> 1:09:10.145
No!

1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:11.813
And then maybe Kurt found out

1:09:11.848 --> 1:09:13.414
that she didn't
show up for work.

1:09:13.450 --> 1:09:16.017
<i> Maybe someone on the base told</i>
<i> him that you were there.</i>

1:09:16.052 --> 1:09:18.753
You got into an argument
and you hit him, too.

1:09:18.788 --> 1:09:20.021
Enough to make him weak,

1:09:20.056 --> 1:09:23.925
and then maybe you told him you
were taking him to the hospital.

1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:27.629
But instead, you took him
to the park.

1:09:27.664 --> 1:09:30.832
No, no, I could never hurt him.

1:09:30.867 --> 1:09:33.001
Even though he hurt you?

1:09:38.942 --> 1:09:41.543
I'd like to call a lawyer.

1:09:45.649 --> 1:09:47.415
[exhales]

1:09:47.450 --> 1:09:49.617
Monty's gonna take that
as a confession.

1:09:49.653 --> 1:09:52.120
Well, she feels guilt,
that much is obvious,

1:09:52.155 --> 1:09:55.456
but she also feels backed
into a corner.

1:09:55.492 --> 1:09:58.860
Do you think she did it?

1:09:58.895 --> 1:10:01.629
I don't know, Fincher.

1:10:05.602 --> 1:10:08.303
It's for the best,
Detective Montgomery.

1:10:08.338 --> 1:10:11.806
But now he has confirmation
that his daughter was murdered.

1:10:11.841 --> 1:10:14.209
His threats might
not be so idle.

1:10:14.244 --> 1:10:15.009
Hailey.

1:10:15.045 --> 1:10:16.144
It's nice to see you here.

1:10:16.179 --> 1:10:17.445
Am I interrupting?

1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:19.681
No, I'm pretty much done.

1:10:19.716 --> 1:10:21.950
I don't want to press charges
on Mr. Park

1:10:21.985 --> 1:10:23.418
for the threatening note.

1:10:23.453 --> 1:10:26.054
And I'm worried
that he may escalate.

1:10:26.089 --> 1:10:27.722
What do you think, Hailey?

1:10:27.757 --> 1:10:29.924
With only a threatening note
to prosecute,

1:10:29.960 --> 1:10:32.961
a grieving military father could
capture public sentiment,

1:10:32.996 --> 1:10:35.563
and you'd lose the case.

1:10:35.599 --> 1:10:37.632
As usual, your intuition
is spot on.

1:10:37.667 --> 1:10:41.536
It's a trait I wish I could
inject into all my ADAs.

1:10:41.571 --> 1:10:43.204
Just like old times, Hailey.

1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:45.039
[laughs]

1:10:45.075 --> 1:10:46.407
So, where's Fincher?

1:10:46.443 --> 1:10:50.812
With Megan, under strict orders
to eat and sleep.

1:10:50.847 --> 1:10:54.782
It is hard to lose a friend
to needless violence.

1:10:54.818 --> 1:10:56.551
Oh, Hailey, I'm sorry.

1:10:56.586 --> 1:10:57.418
I didn't mean...

1:10:57.454 --> 1:11:00.455
Oh, it's okay Monty. Really.

1:11:00.490 --> 1:11:02.724
I just feel like we're
missing something.

1:11:02.759 --> 1:11:05.393
Forensics didn't find

illegal guns

1:20:00.229 --> 1:20:02.797
that kill innocent
people every day.

1:20:07.470 --> 1:20:08.869
Paulina, what are you
doing here?

1:20:08.905 --> 1:20:10.504
You don't usually come
to crime scenes.

1:20:10.540 --> 1:20:11.605
When I heard what happened,

1:20:11.641 --> 1:20:13.374
I had to come see
for myself.

1:20:13.409 --> 1:20:15.209
I couldn't lose my
best investigator

1:20:15.244 --> 1:20:18.379
and my best ADA in one night.

1:20:18.414 --> 1:20:20.314
I don't work for you anymore.

1:20:20.349 --> 1:20:21.582
What if you did?

1:20:21.617 --> 1:20:23.217
What if you came back?

1:20:23.252 --> 1:20:25.519
Things are different
at the DA's office now.

1:20:25.555 --> 1:20:27.855
I could use your support.

1:20:27.890 --> 1:20:29.256
And your talent.

1:20:29.292 --> 1:20:31.592
Is there something else going on
other than Clayton Morrel

1:20:31.627 --> 1:20:33.627
coming up for parole?

1:20:33.663 --> 1:20:35.729
That intuition again.

1:20:35.765 --> 1:20:38.899
The offer stands, Hailey.

1:20:38.935 --> 1:20:39.800
Paulina...

1:20:39.836 --> 1:20:41.669
Don't answer me now.

1:20:41.704 --> 1:20:43.737
Think about it.

1:20:52.548 --> 1:20:54.448
You okay?

1:20:54.483 --> 1:20:56.884
Thanks, Hailey.

1:20:56.919 --> 1:20:58.385
I mean it.

1:20:58.421 --> 1:21:01.555
I don't know what would've
happened if you weren't here.

1:21:01.591 --> 1:21:04.291
I never doubted you
for a second.

1:21:04.327 --> 1:21:06.260
I just, I feel so bad.

1:21:06.295 --> 1:21:08.863
Kurt was alone in all this.

1:21:08.898 --> 1:21:12.666
He knew there was a conspiracy
that went to the core,

1:21:12.702 --> 1:21:14.134
and he didn't know
who he could trust.

1:21:14.170 --> 1:21:16.370
Well, he trusted you.

1:21:16.405 --> 1:21:18.706
You did him proud, Fincher.

1:21:18.741 --> 1:21:21.208
What do you Marines say?

1:21:21.244 --> 1:21:22.343
"Hooya."

1:21:22.378 --> 1:21:24.078
Uh. No, no, no. No.

1:21:24.113 --> 1:21:27.314
The men's department
of the navy, the Marines?

1:21:27.350 --> 1:21:29.884
No, we say "Oorah."

1:21:29.919 --> 1:21:31.218
Oorah then.

1:21:31.254 --> 1:21:34.355
Uh, more emphasis
on the "ooh."

1:21:34.390 --> 1:21:35.456
First syllable.

1:21:35.491 --> 1:21:36.323
"Oorah."

1:21:36.359 --> 1:21:37.825
Ooh... Rah.

1:21:37.860 --> 1:21:38.926
[laughs] No, no, no.

1:21:38.961 --> 1:21:40.127
Not a dance move.

1:21:40.162 --> 1:21:40.928
[laughs]

1:21:40.963 --> 1:21:41.695
Oorah.

1:21:41.731 --> 1:21:42.463
Ooh ooh ooh.

1:21:42.498 --> 1:21:43.163
Oorah.

1:21:43.199 --> 1:21:43.931
I'm, I'm done.

1:21:43.966 --> 1:21:44.798
You do it.

1:21:44.834 --> 1:21:46.700
Just, you say it.
You're the Marine.

1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:52.039
Are you all right?

1:21:52.074 --> 1:21:53.674
I ran out of the lab as soon
as you called.

1:21:53.709 --> 1:21:56.644
Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.

1:21:56.679 --> 1:21:57.511
Something's wrong?

1:21:57.546 --> 1:21:58.646
No, nothing's wrong.

1:21:58.681 --> 1:22:00.814
Nothing important.

1:22:00.850 --> 1:22:03.684
Nothing important?

1:22:03.719 --> 1:22:05.219
Is this about the calendar?

1:22:05.254 --> 1:22:07.121
Well, I am not worried about
you running off

1:22:07.156 --> 1:22:09.189
with the first woman who asks
for your autograph,

1:22:09.225 --> 1:22:10.891
if that's what you mean.

1:22:10.927 --> 1:22:12.860
You're jealous.

1:22:12.895 --> 1:22:13.794
Yes, I am.

1:22:13.829 --> 1:22:14.595
[laughs]

1:22:14.630 --> 1:22:15.696
I admit it.

1:22:15.731 --> 1:22:17.564
I am really, really,
really jealous.

1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:19.867
This whole calendar thing and
you looking like a movie star,

1:22:19.902 --> 1:22:21.335
and women everywhere.

1:22:21.370 --> 1:22:23.504
At first it was fine,
and then it wasn't.

1:22:23.539 --> 1:22:24.772
I don't like it, I just,
I don't...

1:22:24.807 --> 1:22:26.073
I don't like the way
it makes me feel.

1:22:26.108 --> 1:22:27.308
That's perfectly normal, Hailey.

1:22:27.343 --> 1:22:28.175
Not for me it's not.

1:22:28.210 --> 1:22:30.444
I don't want other women
staring at you

1:22:30.479 --> 1:22:31.378
or being interested in you.

1:22:31.414 --> 1:22:32.913
I don't want them anywhere
near you, okay?

1:22:32.949 --> 1:22:34.348
I don't want to have
to share you, Jonas.

1:22:34.383 --> 1:22:35.549
Because I love you.

1:22:35.584 --> 1:22:37.284
I'm in love with you.

1:22:40.656 --> 1:22:41.889
So that's the truth,

1:22:41.924 --> 1:22:44.558
and I didn't mean to just
blurt it out like that,

1:22:44.593 --> 1:22:46.593
or put you on the spot.

1:22:46.629 --> 1:22:48.963
That's why I called you,
that's what I wanted to say.

1:22:48.998 --> 1:22:50.030
And you don't have
to say it back.

1:22:50.066 --> 1:22:52.399
Really, you don't.

1:22:52.435 --> 1:22:57.972
I have loved you since
the first moment I met you.

1:22:58.007 --> 1:23:01.408
I have just been waiting
for you to be ready to hear it.

1:23:03.245 --> 1:23:05.646
I love you, Hailey Dean.
