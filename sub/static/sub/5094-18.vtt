WEBVTT

00:04.665 --> 00:08.034
I can't tell you how much
I look forward to this.

00:08.036 --> 00:09.502
You look forward
to working out?

00:09.504 --> 00:12.672
Girl time. You know, talking
about shoes and shopping

00:12.674 --> 00:15.107
and anything other
than sports.

00:15.109 --> 00:17.376
I live in a man cave, you know.
(chuckles)

00:17.378 --> 00:19.045
I could use
a little more of that.

00:19.047 --> 00:20.680
The man, not the cave.
(chuckles)

00:20.682 --> 00:23.382
You know what you should
try? Speed dating.

00:23.384 --> 00:25.685
I should not try speed dating.
Yeah...

00:25.687 --> 00:27.587
Yeah, you should totally
try speed dating.

00:27.589 --> 00:30.323
It takes, like, an hour and you
come away with, like, 20 dates.

00:30.325 --> 00:31.136
No.

00:31.137 --> 00:32.909
I tell you what, you see
that food cart down there?

00:32.934 --> 00:34.127
Yeah.

00:34.128 --> 00:36.028
I will race you
to that food cart,

00:36.030 --> 00:38.664
and, if I win,
you go speed dating.

00:38.666 --> 00:40.399
What if I win?

00:40.401 --> 00:44.170
Um, I'll do family
dinners for a month.

00:44.172 --> 00:45.371
You ready?
On three.

00:45.373 --> 00:46.539
All right.
Prepare to lose.

00:46.541 --> 00:49.175
Three.
(chuckles) What?

00:51.812 --> 00:53.646
(laughing)

00:53.648 --> 00:55.481
DANNY:
<i>Best defensive end.</i>

00:55.483 --> 00:56.983
BAEZ:
<i>Reggie White.</i>

00:56.985 --> 00:58.384
No way.
Michael Strahan.

00:58.386 --> 00:59.619
The Minister of Defense.
That's all I'm gonna say.

00:59.621 --> 01:02.321
DANNY: <i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>All right, best tight end.</i>

01:02.323 --> 01:03.746
BAEZ:
<i>Benny Allegretti. Hands down.</i>

01:03.747 --> 01:04.272
Who?

01:04.297 --> 01:05.890
I had a crush on
him in sixth grade.

01:06.861 --> 01:08.361
Oh, boy.

01:08.363 --> 01:10.530
What do we got?
Female,

01:10.532 --> 01:12.298
looks like mid-40s. No I.D.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.833
Just this business card
in her jacket.

01:13.835 --> 01:16.903
Dr. Alex Garland, St.
Benjamin's Medical Center.

01:16.905 --> 01:18.771
No purse, no belongings?
Nothing.

01:18.773 --> 01:19.972
Who called it in?

01:19.974 --> 01:21.140
Anonymous 911 call.

01:21.142 --> 01:22.608
Witnesses?
No.

01:22.610 --> 01:25.344
Who's the best defensive end
in NFL history, by the way?

01:25.346 --> 01:26.712
Jared Allen.

01:26.714 --> 01:29.348
Jared? Come on.
Beat it with that.

01:31.051 --> 01:33.119
What do you think?

01:33.121 --> 01:34.287
Robbery?

01:34.289 --> 01:35.755
Yeah,
maybe.

01:35.757 --> 01:37.723
But why would she be walking
along Newtown Creek?

01:37.725 --> 01:40.192
And in Christian Louboutins?
Say what?

01:40.194 --> 01:42.028
Those shoes cost
a thousand bucks, Reagan.

01:42.030 --> 01:45.097
Don't even try testing
my knowledge of high-end shoes.

01:45.966 --> 01:48.134
Hmm.

01:52.072 --> 01:54.006
Hey, Sarge.
We got one under

01:54.008 --> 01:56.208
for robbery and assault
in the first degree.

01:56.210 --> 01:57.455
Daniel Carson.
It's a lie.

01:57.456 --> 01:59.179
Oh, yeah. Just for the record, 
he's innocent.

01:59.204 --> 02:00.380
I'm sure.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.548
Man, I was gonna bring it all back.
This is all a big mistake--

02:02.550 --> 02:04.884
the witness I.D.,
the video surveillance.

02:04.886 --> 02:06.552
The evidence we found
in his possession.

02:06.577 --> 02:07.387
All right,

02:07.388 --> 02:09.822
Janko, start the paperwork.

02:09.824 --> 02:11.490
Reagan, you need to report

02:11.492 --> 02:13.826
to the chief of Ds' office
forthwith.

02:14.695 --> 02:16.729
Just me?

02:16.731 --> 02:18.431
That's what the boss said.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.867
You got it?
Uh-huh.

02:29.142 --> 02:30.676
(indistinct chatter)

02:30.678 --> 02:31.844
MAN:
We'll begin

02:31.846 --> 02:32.945
with the first gong.

02:32.947 --> 02:34.981
You will have five minutes
with each candidate.

02:34.983 --> 02:37.683
(gong clangs loudly)

02:40.520 --> 02:41.621
A musician?

02:41.623 --> 02:43.089
(English accent):
Yeah, drummer, actually.

02:43.091 --> 02:44.790
We're playing up in Rhinebeck
this weekend

02:44.792 --> 02:47.026
at the beer festival.
You should come and hang.

02:47.028 --> 02:48.260
It's gonna be epic.

02:48.262 --> 02:50.062
(gong clangs)

02:50.064 --> 02:51.597
My bonus was worth more
than my parents' house,

02:51.599 --> 02:52.732
you know what I'm saying?

02:52.734 --> 02:54.400
(gong clangs)

02:54.402 --> 02:55.401
Just one question.

02:55.403 --> 02:57.236
Um, do you like kids?

02:57.238 --> 02:58.270
What about
dogs? Uh,

02:58.272 --> 02:59.238
I have a Chowhuahua.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.840
Big head, little body,
falls a lot.

03:00.842 --> 03:01.842
That's a really nice dress.

03:01.843 --> 03:04.543
My mother helped me
pick this shirt out.

03:04.545 --> 03:05.645
You're really pretty.

03:05.647 --> 03:07.380
(gong clangs)

03:07.382 --> 03:10.349
Nice to meet you... Erin.

03:11.685 --> 03:13.052
First time
speed dating?

03:13.054 --> 03:15.254
And last.
It's, um...

03:15.256 --> 03:15.988
Weird?

03:15.990 --> 03:17.857
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.

03:17.859 --> 03:20.059
(phone vibrates)
Sorry, um...

03:20.061 --> 03:22.561
Hello. Just prepare
an order to produce

03:22.563 --> 03:23.929
and I'll sign it
when I get back.

03:23.931 --> 03:26.932
Okay. Sorry.

03:26.934 --> 03:29.602
(phone vibrates)
(groans)

03:29.604 --> 03:32.171
You know,
we only have five minutes.

03:32.173 --> 03:32.644
It's my office.

03:32.669 --> 03:33.807
Well, I'm sure they
can live without you for five...

03:33.808 --> 03:36.742
Hello.
Reschedule it

03:36.744 --> 03:38.611
around
the Saunder proffer.

03:38.613 --> 03:42.181
Okay. Sorry.

03:42.183 --> 03:43.549
No, you're not.

03:43.551 --> 03:44.917
Excuse me?

03:44.919 --> 03:46.352
If you were really sorry,

03:46.354 --> 03:48.454
you wouldn't be taking calls
from work that can wait.

03:48.456 --> 03:50.582
And how do you know
they can wait?

03:50.607 --> 03:52.025
When you have exactly

03:52.026 --> 03:54.026
five timed minutes
to talk to someone--

03:54.028 --> 03:55.995
someone who, by the way,
isn't enjoying this

03:55.997 --> 03:58.764
revolving door of "dates" any
more than you seem to be...

03:58.766 --> 04:00.213
For your information,
I'm not your date.

04:00.238 --> 04:01.401
Well, that's good,

04:01.402 --> 04:04.603
because if you were and you were
rude enough to take calls

04:04.605 --> 04:06.405
in the middle of a date, I'd have
been gone before the appetizers.

04:06.407 --> 04:09.008
Well, that would have been
perfectly fine with me

04:09.010 --> 04:10.409
because I certainly
would not want

04:10.411 --> 04:11.544
to waste my time
with a man

04:11.546 --> 04:15.147
who clearly has a problem
sharing attention.

04:23.056 --> 04:25.057
(exhales)

04:25.059 --> 04:27.226
(indistinct chatter)

04:29.730 --> 04:30.763
Hello.
Dr. Garland?

04:30.765 --> 04:31.797
Yeah.
Detectives Reagan and Baez.

04:31.799 --> 04:33.933
We have a few questions
for you.

04:33.935 --> 04:36.202
Okay. Well, I'm working,
so this needs to be quick.

04:36.204 --> 04:37.970
Uh, we're investigating
a homicide.

04:37.972 --> 04:41.207
The deceased had no I.D. on her
other than your business card.

04:41.209 --> 04:42.875
Well, I see hundreds
of patients a day.

04:42.877 --> 04:44.477
I give out hundreds of cards.
(chuckles)

04:44.479 --> 04:46.545
Can you just take a look
at this picture and see

04:46.547 --> 04:49.115
if you recognize her?

04:50.951 --> 04:52.618
Dr. Garland,
you know this woman?

04:54.821 --> 04:56.989
It's my wife.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:05.098 --> 05:07.032
Chief.

05:07.034 --> 05:10.236
Officer Reagan.

05:10.238 --> 05:11.637
Please sit.

05:16.977 --> 05:18.644
Yeah, we're ready.

05:18.646 --> 05:20.479
Okay.

05:22.082 --> 05:24.650
(sighs)

05:36.930 --> 05:39.899
(sighs)

05:39.901 --> 05:41.200
(door opens)

05:50.010 --> 05:52.378
You're not in trouble,
if that's what you're thinking.

05:52.380 --> 05:53.946
I don't know what to think.

05:56.416 --> 05:58.617
A ten-year-old
homicide case.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.052
Michelle Lowe.

06:00.054 --> 06:02.221
23 years old.

06:04.224 --> 06:06.125
Her mother thinks we got
the wrong guy.

06:06.127 --> 06:08.260
I want you to find out
if she's right.

06:09.896 --> 06:11.430
Why are you giving it to me?

06:11.432 --> 06:14.033
It's delicate.

06:14.035 --> 06:16.368
Needs to be under the radar.

06:17.938 --> 06:19.972
I need someone I can trust

06:19.974 --> 06:22.508
and someone who is capable.

06:24.578 --> 06:27.279
And I'm not asking;
it's an order.

Erin, hey.

07:16.217 --> 07:17.950
This is now officially
your case.

07:17.952 --> 07:20.853
<i>People v. Serena Morales?</i>

07:20.855 --> 07:22.688
I have a scheduling issue.

07:22.690 --> 07:24.623
Morales and her boyfriend,
Robert Sandoval,

07:24.625 --> 07:26.258
robbed a bodega at gunpoint,
Terrific.

07:26.260 --> 07:29.495
and Morales' defense attorney
is in your office waiting,

07:29.497 --> 07:33.065
and he's won the last 19 out of
20 cases he's taken to trial.

07:33.067 --> 07:34.567
So good luck.

07:34.569 --> 07:36.435
Great.

07:38.705 --> 07:40.840
If you're here to discuss
the Morales case,

07:40.842 --> 07:42.074
you're gonna have to come back.

07:42.076 --> 07:43.809
It was just handed to me,
and I haven't had time

07:43.811 --> 07:45.778
to familiarize myself
with it, so...

07:47.681 --> 07:49.348
Robert McCoy.

07:49.350 --> 07:51.617
Pleased to meet you again,
Ms. Reagan.

07:51.619 --> 07:54.687
Hi.

08:02.829 --> 08:04.296
I know your time is valuable.

08:04.298 --> 08:06.298
Oh, please.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.834
But if you just let me give you
a rundown on the particulars.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.803
As you see them?
I'd rather make up my own mind,

08:10.805 --> 08:13.005
and I was just handed
the case, so...

08:13.007 --> 08:15.307
I'd like a bail reduction.

08:15.309 --> 08:18.544
Your client, Ms. Morales,
has a record.

08:18.546 --> 08:20.379
She's not the one
who had the gun.

08:21.214 --> 08:23.315
Not according to the eyewitness

08:23.317 --> 08:25.050
who was in the store
at the time,

08:25.052 --> 08:27.753
who gave a statement that
it was your client with the gun.

08:27.755 --> 08:29.622
The witness was high on coke.

08:31.391 --> 08:33.159
I'll destroy her on cross.

08:33.160 --> 08:36.261
Okay, well,
I guess I'll see you in court.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.309
For this draft of your speech
to the U.N.,

08:50.311 --> 08:53.078
do you want to get
into the intelligence division?

08:53.080 --> 08:54.547
I do not.

08:54.549 --> 08:55.748
(door opens)

08:55.750 --> 08:58.484
Brooklyn D.A. James Campbell
is here.

08:58.486 --> 09:00.920
Okay. I want you to sit sit in.

09:00.922 --> 09:02.388
I may need backup.

09:02.390 --> 09:03.622
What's it about?

09:04.491 --> 09:06.058
Let's have him.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.861
Mr. Campbell.

09:08.863 --> 09:10.162
My DCPI, Garrett Moore.

09:10.164 --> 09:11.931
Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Moore.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.766
Please sit down.
Commissioner.

09:15.569 --> 09:18.237
Are you reinvestigating
the Michelle Lowe case?

09:21.274 --> 09:22.841
Why would I do that?

09:22.843 --> 09:24.610
(chuckles)

09:24.612 --> 09:27.046
The Brooklyn D.A.'s office
and One PP

09:27.048 --> 09:29.248
have always had
a mutually beneficial

09:29.250 --> 09:30.549
and respectful relationship,
Commissioner.

09:30.551 --> 09:31.884
Yes, we have.

09:31.886 --> 09:33.052
We've provided you

09:33.054 --> 09:35.221
with the trial transcript
of the Michelle Lowe case,

09:35.223 --> 09:36.755
as requested,
but you haven't provided

09:36.757 --> 09:37.990
a reason for that request.

09:37.992 --> 09:39.959
Nor do I have to.

09:39.961 --> 09:42.928
Proper protocol would have been
for you to discuss your concerns

09:42.930 --> 09:44.897
about the conviction
with my office

09:44.899 --> 09:46.432
before you began
an investigation.

09:46.434 --> 09:50.736
There is no protocol to suggest
that I check with your office

09:50.738 --> 09:54.440
for permission if I decide
to investigate a case.

09:54.442 --> 09:56.742
This isn't just any case.

09:56.744 --> 09:59.945
This is an extremely
high-profile case,

09:59.947 --> 10:02.548
and one that could result
in handing a serial killer

10:02.550 --> 10:04.450
the grounds for a retrial.

10:04.452 --> 10:05.784
And whose fault is that?

10:08.288 --> 10:10.689
I prosecuted
the Sam Mundy killings.

10:10.691 --> 10:12.925
They were solid convictions.

10:12.927 --> 10:14.226
One was sloppy.

10:14.228 --> 10:16.795
If the commissioner decides
he needs to inform

10:16.797 --> 10:18.497
your office
of any new development,

10:18.499 --> 10:20.666
he will contact you.

10:22.469 --> 10:24.603
If you taint that conviction,

10:24.605 --> 10:27.139
then you can be the one
to tell the victims' families.

10:33.813 --> 10:35.948
That went well, don't you think?

10:40.787 --> 10:42.788
My wife is in Aruba
with a girlfriend.

10:42.790 --> 10:44.089
She just left two days ago.

10:44.091 --> 10:45.691
In-in fact, she
called me yesterday

10:45.693 --> 10:47.893
to tell me that
she was there, safe.

10:47.895 --> 10:50.963
I think we're gonna need
that girlfriend's name, Doc.

10:53.133 --> 10:54.233
Emily Mathews.

10:54.235 --> 10:56.001
It was supposed to be
a girls' week.

10:56.003 --> 10:58.003
We'll need
her contact information, too.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.872
DANNY: Do you have any idea
why your wife

10:59.874 --> 11:01.974
would lie to you
about going to Aruba?

11:01.976 --> 11:03.642
It doesn't make sense.

11:03.644 --> 11:04.943
BAEZ:
Mr. Garland,

11:04.945 --> 11:07.513
is it possible your wife was
meeting with someone else?

11:07.515 --> 11:09.214
Someone other
than her girlfriend?

11:09.216 --> 11:12.151
I don't understand.

11:12.153 --> 11:13.919
Did you ever have any reason

11:13.921 --> 11:16.155
to suspect
she might be having an affair?

11:16.157 --> 11:17.823
No.

11:17.825 --> 11:19.625
We're just trying to understand
why your wife would tell you

11:19.627 --> 11:22.094
she was in Aruba
when she was here.

11:33.106 --> 11:35.908
I need some time.

11:39.379 --> 11:40.879
BAEZ:
Reagan.

11:40.881 --> 11:43.082
I went through all
of Nicole Garland's

11:43.084 --> 11:44.550
credit card statements.

11:44.552 --> 11:46.251
She never booked
a trip to Aruba.

11:46.253 --> 11:47.619
Why the hell
would she lie

11:47.621 --> 11:49.054
to her husband
about going to Aruba?

11:49.056 --> 11:50.222
Maybe she was really
having an affair?

11:50.224 --> 11:51.757
What did her
friend Emily say?

11:51.759 --> 11:55.694
Emily's husband answered, and
said his wife <i>is</i> in Aruba.

11:55.696 --> 11:57.196
According to him,
she's due back tomorrow.

11:57.198 --> 11:58.931
Why don't you look and see
if there's a boyfriend hidden

11:58.933 --> 12:01.166
somewhere in those credit card
statements and phone records,

12:01.168 --> 12:02.468
and I'll talk
to the one person

12:02.470 --> 12:03.702
who can shed some
light on this case.

12:03.704 --> 12:04.903
The family?

12:04.905 --> 12:07.573
No, the M.E.

12:12.679 --> 12:15.280
JANKO: Hey.
JAMIE: Hey.

12:15.282 --> 12:17.916
So, what happened?

12:17.918 --> 12:19.418
Nothing.

12:19.420 --> 12:20.953
What did the chief
of Ds want?

12:20.955 --> 12:22.488
You getting promoted?

12:22.490 --> 12:25.290
No, I'm not getting promoted.

12:25.292 --> 12:26.892
Demoted?

12:26.894 --> 12:29.395
Are you gonna make me guess
why you were taken off patrol?

12:29.397 --> 12:30.796
Do I have to guess

12:30.798 --> 12:33.132
why I'm stuck processing
this collar by myself?

12:33.134 --> 12:34.933
I can't talk about it.

12:34.935 --> 12:36.335
Okay, you can't talk about it.

12:36.337 --> 12:37.770
Right, 'cause
I'm just your partner.

12:37.772 --> 12:40.172
No reason to think
you could trust me or anything.

12:40.174 --> 12:43.409
I was asked
to not talk about it.

12:43.411 --> 12:45.611
Fine.

12:46.946 --> 12:48.247
Good luck with it.

12:49.082 --> 12:50.983
Eddie, come on. Wait.

12:55.922 --> 12:57.923
No broken bones,
no contusions,

12:57.925 --> 13:00.526
at least not the kind
that come from an assault.

13:00.528 --> 13:01.860
What do you mean?
It means

13:01.862 --> 13:03.362
all of her swelling
and contusions

13:03.364 --> 13:04.963
were the result of surgery.

13:04.965 --> 13:07.399
When did she have surgery?
Recently.

13:07.401 --> 13:09.902
Within hours of her death,
which might explain

13:09.904 --> 13:11.737
the high levels
of fentanyl in her system.

13:11.739 --> 13:13.972
What do you mean, fentanyl?

13:13.974 --> 13:15.808
It's a narcotics pain reliever.
It's what killed her.

13:15.810 --> 13:17.009
I know what it is.

13:17.011 --> 13:19.044
What, you're saying
she OD'd on it?

13:19.046 --> 13:20.412
More like she had
a reaction to it,

13:20.414 --> 13:21.680
went into anaphylactic shock.

13:21.682 --> 13:23.515
Basically,
she stopped breathing.

13:23.517 --> 13:25.083
Oh. What was wrong with her?

13:25.085 --> 13:26.518
What do you mean?
I don't know.

13:26.520 --> 13:27.786
You said she had surgery.

13:27.788 --> 13:30.022
Was she sick? What?
What was she suffering from?

13:30.024 --> 13:31.623
Perhaps low self-esteem.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.525
She had a boob job
and a tummy tuck.

13:54.260 --> 13:56.862
Your coffeemaker on the fritz?

13:56.864 --> 13:59.397
You remember the first homicide
you ever caught?

13:59.399 --> 14:01.299
(sighs)

14:01.301 --> 14:04.336
Mary Ann Reynolds
from Athens, Ohio.

14:04.338 --> 14:05.837
She was 18.

14:05.839 --> 14:07.672
She was a prostitute
working Times Square

14:07.674 --> 14:10.375
in the days
when it was full of sex shops.

14:10.377 --> 14:11.943
You closed the case?

14:11.945 --> 14:15.614
Her killer's doing life
in Sing Sing.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.185
Did you give me this case
because I told you

14:20.187 --> 14:23.355
I was frustrated about not
being promoted to detective?

14:29.829 --> 14:32.197
(sighs)
No.

14:34.467 --> 14:37.802
I gave it to you because
I think you can handle it,

14:37.804 --> 14:40.005
and I need discretion.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.174
Do you know
where you're going to start?

14:43.176 --> 14:44.643
With the witness who recanted.

14:44.645 --> 14:45.877
Well,

14:45.879 --> 14:48.013
that's gonna be difficult.

14:48.015 --> 14:50.982
He died of a heart attack
two weeks ago.

14:50.984 --> 14:54.386
Well, other than that,
what proof is there

14:54.388 --> 14:55.921
that the wrong guy's
behind bars?

14:55.923 --> 14:58.523
None... so far.

14:58.525 --> 15:00.425
Okay, so why me?

15:00.427 --> 15:03.595
When the witness died,

15:03.597 --> 15:09.200
I realized that in spite of
what I had said to the mother,

15:09.202 --> 15:11.770
that I had been sitting on it.

15:11.772 --> 15:14.072
(sighs)

15:14.074 --> 15:17.809
If I was smart,
I wouldn't be doing this.

15:17.811 --> 15:21.112
It's a problem I had
when I was a detective.

15:21.114 --> 15:23.415
I got too involved in my cases.

15:24.383 --> 15:26.751
I think your brother Danny
inherited that.

15:28.554 --> 15:30.755
Joe was certainly that way.

15:32.491 --> 15:35.393
And I see it in you, too.

15:38.097 --> 15:42.434
I need you to help me keep
a promise to a grieving mother.

15:46.572 --> 15:49.474
DANNY: <i>Thank you for coming in,</i>
<i>Mrs. Mathews.</i>

15:49.476 --> 15:51.142
Yeah, we can talk
right over here.

15:51.144 --> 15:53.211
Nicole told her husband
she was going to Aruba,

15:53.213 --> 15:55.981
but she was really
getting a mommy makeover.

15:55.983 --> 15:57.582
Mommy makeover?
That's what she called it.

15:57.584 --> 15:58.950
Tummy tuck
to get rid of

15:58.952 --> 16:00.719
the stretch marks,
bigger boobs.

16:00.721 --> 16:02.554
You notice
there are no daddy makeovers

16:02.556 --> 16:04.322
to get rid of beer bellies

16:04.324 --> 16:05.690
and fix receding
hairlines.

16:05.692 --> 16:07.726
Okay, why did she tell her
husband she was going to Aruba?

16:07.728 --> 16:08.994
She wanted

16:08.996 --> 16:11.629
to surprise him with the results
at the end of the week.

16:11.631 --> 16:13.331
She preferred
not to recuperate at home.

16:13.333 --> 16:15.967
So, she was staying in the city.
Did she say where?

16:15.969 --> 16:17.168
The Park Hotel.

16:17.170 --> 16:18.403
Why was she getting it done?

16:18.405 --> 16:20.772
She thought
her husband was getting bored.

16:20.774 --> 16:23.108
She thought going
under the knife

16:23.110 --> 16:26.277
would make her more
desirable to him.

16:26.279 --> 16:28.680
I wish I'd been able to
convince her she didn't need it.

16:28.682 --> 16:30.115
Do you got a doctor's name?

16:30.117 --> 16:31.349
I don't know his name,

16:31.351 --> 16:33.518
but I remember her telling me
she'd be able

16:33.520 --> 16:35.587
to walk to his office
from her hotel.

16:36.489 --> 16:37.522
Okay.

16:37.524 --> 16:39.591
The Lowe murder
was shocking.

16:39.593 --> 16:42.260
Ten years later, I still
can't believe it happened.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.162
Did you see
Michelle that day?

16:44.164 --> 16:47.198
I saw her earlier in the
day, as she was leaving.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.402
I reminded her to lock all
her windows before she left.

16:50.404 --> 16:52.670
We'd had a rash of
robberies on this block.

16:52.672 --> 16:54.105
Guy ever get caught?

16:54.107 --> 16:57.709
I heard he was arrested,
but, uh, I don't know.

16:57.711 --> 17:00.111
I just know the
robberies stopped.

17:00.113 --> 17:01.346
You have a pretty good memory

17:01.348 --> 17:03.048
of a day
that happened ten years ago.

17:03.050 --> 17:05.316
(sighs)
It really affected me.

17:05.318 --> 17:09.054
I-I still think about it,
the senselessness.

17:09.056 --> 17:11.556
Was anyone else in the building
affected? Was she

17:11.558 --> 17:12.924
friendly with anyone?

17:12.925 --> 17:14.759
The Charltons across the hall,

17:14.761 --> 17:16.127
Mrs. Fitzner next door.

17:16.128 --> 17:18.063
Uh, I think those
are the only people

17:18.065 --> 17:19.864
left over from that time.
Hmm.

17:19.866 --> 17:23.635
And do you remember her having
any problems with anyone?

17:23.637 --> 17:27.505
All I remember thinking
when she was murdered is, uh,

17:27.507 --> 17:30.775
who on earth would want
to hurt that girl?

17:34.046 --> 17:35.480
According to the phone records,

17:35.482 --> 17:38.283
the last call she made was
to this office at 10:00 a.m.

17:38.285 --> 17:40.452
the day she died.

17:40.454 --> 17:43.188
Excuse me. We need
to speak to Dr. Levine.

17:43.190 --> 17:44.656
Do you have an appointment?

17:44.658 --> 17:47.125
No. It's about Nicole Garland.

17:47.127 --> 17:48.893
Is she okay?

17:48.895 --> 17:50.061
She's dead.

17:51.130 --> 17:52.931
We need to speak
to the doctor now.

17:53.666 --> 17:55.066
I have no idea why

17:55.068 --> 17:56.734
she wanted to pay cash,

17:56.736 --> 17:58.136
keep it a secret
from her husband.

17:58.138 --> 17:59.604
That's none of my business.

17:59.606 --> 18:01.973
In this type of practice,
a lot of women--

18:01.975 --> 18:03.908
they like to keep the work
they're getting done a secret.

18:03.910 --> 18:07.078
Kind of hard to keep
big boobs a secret.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.748
Mrs. Garland was very specific
about the work she wanted done,

18:10.750 --> 18:12.517
how she wanted
to handle her recovery.

18:12.519 --> 18:14.052
She know she could die from it?

18:14.054 --> 18:15.987
Are you suggesting that she died

18:15.989 --> 18:17.722
from the plastic surgery
she received?

18:17.724 --> 18:19.958
Yeah, I'm suggesting
it's possible, yeah.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.193
Her surgery was routine.

18:22.195 --> 18:23.361
I've done
thousands of them.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.896
So, what happened this time?

18:24.898 --> 18:28.500
I have no idea what happened
when she left the office.

18:28.502 --> 18:31.436
In any case, I'm not answering
any more questions, Detective,

18:31.438 --> 18:33.071
without a lawyer.

18:34.273 --> 18:36.474
Okay.

18:38.944 --> 18:41.679
Come on in.

18:41.681 --> 18:44.983
It-it was a long time ago.

18:44.985 --> 18:46.317
Please.

18:46.319 --> 18:47.619
Tell me anything
that you remember

18:47.621 --> 18:49.621
about that night,
where you were...

18:49.623 --> 18:52.323
Um, well, I just remember
that I went out with friends

18:52.325 --> 18:54.859
after work that
night for a drink.

18:54.861 --> 18:57.695
I... I didn't get home
till the wee hours.

18:57.697 --> 18:59.998
Your neighbor, Mrs. Fitzner,
said that you were home.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.233
I was here, but I never heard
any screaming

19:02.235 --> 19:05.203
or anything like that,
nothing out of the ordinary.

19:05.205 --> 19:07.071
Did you see or hear
Michelle come home that night?

19:07.073 --> 19:08.206
Not a word.

19:08.208 --> 19:09.674
I fell asleep around 10:00,

19:09.676 --> 19:11.843
and I didn't hear about the
murder till the next morning.

19:11.845 --> 19:14.012
Do you know
if she made it a habit,

19:14.014 --> 19:15.313
opening her door
to strangers?

19:15.315 --> 19:16.548
Well, I mean,
we wouldn't...

19:16.550 --> 19:17.715
We wouldn't
really know that.

19:17.717 --> 19:19.217
But, like everybody,

19:19.219 --> 19:21.085
she was powerless over alcohol.

19:21.087 --> 19:22.153
She was a drinker?

19:22.155 --> 19:23.421
No.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.822
No, she wasn't a drinker.

19:24.824 --> 19:27.058
I mean, she would have a
glass of wine now and then,

19:27.060 --> 19:28.760
but she was a beautiful
young girl

19:28.762 --> 19:31.196
living in Manhattan
for the first time, so...

19:31.198 --> 19:32.330
I-I think she was careful.

19:32.332 --> 19:34.499
Yeah, I mean, we always
reminded her that

19:34.501 --> 19:36.467
she should be wary
around strangers, but...

19:36.469 --> 19:38.736
I mean, she was young,

19:38.738 --> 19:41.806
so...

19:44.009 --> 19:45.610
I'm hearing rumors that

19:45.612 --> 19:47.512
you're reopening
the Michelle Lowe case.

19:47.514 --> 19:51.416
Unofficially,
I'm having someone look into it.

19:51.418 --> 19:52.450
Who?

19:52.452 --> 19:54.819
Can't tell you.

19:54.821 --> 19:56.254
You can't tell me?
(knocking)

19:56.256 --> 19:57.388
Uh...

19:57.390 --> 19:59.023
Come in.

19:59.025 --> 20:01.092
I got to go, Dad.

20:01.094 --> 20:03.361
I bring a
peace offering.

20:03.363 --> 20:05.430
How did you get
past my secretary?

20:05.432 --> 20:07.799
She, like me, has a problem
sharing attention.

20:07.801 --> 20:10.735
And you don't take no
for an answer, do you?

20:10.737 --> 20:12.237
Give me just a few minutes?

20:13.639 --> 20:15.607
For old times' sake,
I'll give you five.

20:15.609 --> 20:19.177
Only if it's five
uninterrupted minutes.

20:19.179 --> 20:21.079
Start.

20:22.448 --> 20:24.882
This case is important to me.

20:24.884 --> 20:27.118
It's not about
winning.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.686
Although I'm very good at that.

20:28.688 --> 20:30.688
Okay...

20:30.690 --> 20:33.691
I want to help her.

20:33.693 --> 20:35.059
I think she's being railroaded

20:35.061 --> 20:36.828
by her boyfriend Sandoval.

20:36.830 --> 20:38.596
I think he
paid off

20:38.598 --> 20:39.597
the witness to say

20:39.599 --> 20:41.199
it was my client
who had the gun.

20:41.201 --> 20:44.535
Your client is no
stranger to crime.

20:44.537 --> 20:45.536
She's got a record.

20:45.538 --> 20:46.504
Felony assault

20:46.506 --> 20:47.972
and felony
robbery.

20:47.974 --> 20:50.241
But she's been clean
since 2008.

20:51.210 --> 20:52.610
Thank you for the coffee,

20:52.612 --> 20:53.911
but I'm not buying it.

20:53.913 --> 20:55.580
And I am not

20:55.582 --> 20:57.749
negotiating a plea deal.

20:59.718 --> 21:01.419
Do me a favor.

21:01.421 --> 21:02.920
Check out her
last felony.

21:02.922 --> 21:05.490
The felony
assault.

21:05.492 --> 21:10.228
Check out who the prosecutor
on that case was.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.641
(overlapping chatter)

21:51.337 --> 21:53.771
Don't tell me
you were just stopping by.

21:53.773 --> 21:54.906
I don't want you to be mad.

21:54.908 --> 21:59.177
No, you want me to shut up
and not ask questions.

21:59.179 --> 22:01.346
I want you to understand
that it's nothing against you.

22:01.348 --> 22:02.413
It's just,
I'm doing something

22:02.415 --> 22:03.581
that I'm not supposed
to talk about.

22:03.583 --> 22:04.982
Because you don't trust me.

22:04.984 --> 22:06.751
I <i>do</i> trust you.
Right,

22:06.753 --> 22:09.087
as your partner,
you trust me with your life.

22:09.089 --> 22:10.888
Just not with a secret?

22:10.890 --> 22:14.225
Okay, great. I'm glad that you got
that out of the way.

22:14.227 --> 22:16.728
Good night, Reagan.
See you tomorrow.

22:16.730 --> 22:17.995
Eddie...

22:19.598 --> 22:21.232
I'm working on a cold case.

22:21.234 --> 22:25.036
There could be legal or
political problems if it leaks.

22:25.038 --> 22:27.538
And you thought that
if you confided in me

22:27.540 --> 22:30.341
I would spread it around
the entire precinct?

22:30.343 --> 22:31.943
I didn't think
about it.

22:31.945 --> 22:33.411
I just followed orders,
I guess.

22:33.413 --> 22:36.647
I just wish you'd stop taking it
so personally.

22:36.649 --> 22:40.585
Okay, done.
I won't take it personally

22:40.587 --> 22:44.355
that for the last two days I've
been writing parking summonses.

22:45.824 --> 22:47.358
Really?

22:47.360 --> 22:48.993
Really.

22:48.995 --> 22:50.995
I'm sorry. That really sucks.

22:50.997 --> 22:53.564
But I have to admit
I do miss working with you.

22:53.566 --> 22:55.266
I don't know why.
Maybe it's just

22:55.268 --> 22:57.201
all the extensive meals
you like to take.

22:57.203 --> 22:59.303
Maybe it's because
I'm smart and beautiful.

22:59.305 --> 23:00.538
Yeah, that, too.

23:00.540 --> 23:01.706
(chuckles)

23:01.708 --> 23:03.741
So, are we square?

23:03.743 --> 23:04.976
No.

23:04.978 --> 23:08.212
Not until you buy me
a beer, big shot.

23:11.116 --> 23:12.750
Get her a drink.

23:14.820 --> 23:16.454
(speaks indistinctly)

23:20.459 --> 23:24.061
How's my U.N. speech going
and why isn't it here?

23:24.063 --> 23:26.564
That's not until
next week.

23:26.566 --> 23:28.599
You're telling me
not to be prepared?

23:28.601 --> 23:29.700
What's going on?

23:30.636 --> 23:32.837
(sighs)

23:33.672 --> 23:36.040
In spite of what
you said to the D.A.,

23:36.042 --> 23:38.309
you're reinvestigating the
Michelle Lowe case, aren't you?

23:38.311 --> 23:41.245
How long's Jamie been
on the job?

23:41.247 --> 23:45.116
Feels fresh out of the academy.

23:45.118 --> 23:46.384
Two years?

23:46.386 --> 23:49.654
Same way I reacted.

23:49.656 --> 23:51.355
It's been four.

23:54.193 --> 23:55.893
You put Jamie on the case.

23:55.895 --> 24:00.364
I've always been a hard-ass
about not using my job

24:00.366 --> 24:02.300
to show favoritism to my kids.

24:02.302 --> 24:04.569
There's unintentional
consequences

24:04.571 --> 24:07.905
to being the most ethical PC
the department's ever had.

24:07.907 --> 24:11.742
Jamie's a gifted cop,

24:11.744 --> 24:14.445
but no one dares recommend him
for promotion

24:14.447 --> 24:16.848
for fear that I'd question
their motives.

24:16.850 --> 24:19.450
Would it be better if Jamie was
a detective already,

24:19.452 --> 24:21.118
and the guys were whispering
behind his back

24:21.120 --> 24:22.620
that it was nepotism?

24:22.622 --> 24:27.458
It would be better if I wasn't
the one holding him back.

24:36.214 --> 24:37.547
Did you know your nose
and your ears

24:37.549 --> 24:40.586
get bigger as you get older?
What are you talking about?

24:40.587 --> 24:42.553
And you lose elasticity
in your skin.

24:42.555 --> 24:43.921
That's why we start to sag.

24:43.923 --> 24:45.189
You trying
to tell me something,

24:45.191 --> 24:46.777
or are you promoting
plastic surgery here?

24:46.802 --> 24:47.678
What? No!

24:47.679 --> 24:49.846
But I do think people
should do whatever they feel

24:49.848 --> 24:52.491
makes them, you know,
feel better, look better

24:52.492 --> 24:53.752
as long as it's
for themselves.

24:53.753 --> 24:54.930
Well, that's the problem.

24:54.955 --> 24:56.055
Most people don't do it
for themselves.

24:56.056 --> 24:59.190
They do it to make
other people happy. Like Nicole.

24:59.191 --> 25:01.058
She probably just did it
to appease her husband.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.760
The check we ran on
Dr. Levine came back.

25:03.762 --> 25:06.029
The medical board had him
under review for malpractice.

25:06.031 --> 25:10.567
That'd be a pretty good reason
to hide a patient death.

25:10.569 --> 25:12.596
What about you?
Would you do it?

25:12.597 --> 25:13.596
Me?
Yeah.

25:13.598 --> 25:16.165
No. I think beauty
is from the soul.

25:16.167 --> 25:18.434
Besides, I'm already smoking hot.
Ah. Oh.

25:21.271 --> 25:23.806
Excuse me.
Detectives Reagan and Baez.

25:23.808 --> 25:26.075
We're looking into the death
of Nicole Garland.

25:26.077 --> 25:29.612
I heard. That was really sad.
To most of the residents,

25:29.614 --> 25:31.814
I'm the guy
who can get them a cab,

25:31.816 --> 25:33.916
but Mrs. Garland knew my name.

25:33.918 --> 25:35.751
Oh.
She was a nice lady.

25:35.753 --> 25:37.253
When did you see her last?

25:37.255 --> 25:39.021
Wednesday morning.

25:39.023 --> 25:40.689
She didn't come back here
later that day

25:40.691 --> 25:41.690
or anytime after that?

25:41.692 --> 25:43.058
No, Mrs. Garland
never came back here.

25:43.060 --> 25:45.461
Anybody else come
by her apartment?

25:47.163 --> 25:48.964
I'm supposed to be discreet.

25:48.966 --> 25:50.366
I could lose my job.

25:50.368 --> 25:51.867
You could also lose
your freedom.

25:51.869 --> 25:53.535
It's against the law
to withhold information.

25:53.537 --> 25:55.804
Obstruction of justice.
That.

25:58.174 --> 26:00.309
A woman came and stayed
till the next day.

26:00.311 --> 26:01.777
Had you seen her before?

26:01.779 --> 26:03.312
I've seen her before,
but I don't know her name.

26:03.314 --> 26:05.014
Is she a relative?

26:05.016 --> 26:06.982
Not unless it's what you'd call
a kissing cousin.

26:06.984 --> 26:09.118
What are you saying?

26:09.120 --> 26:10.252
You saying this woman

26:10.254 --> 26:11.987
and Mr. Garland
were having an affair?

26:11.989 --> 26:13.355
They're all over each other

26:13.357 --> 26:15.190
as soon
as the elevator door closes,

26:15.192 --> 26:17.359
like they can't wait to get upstairs.
Oh.

26:17.361 --> 26:18.727
What does she look like?

26:18.729 --> 26:21.697
She's a... hot blonde
in her 20s.

26:21.699 --> 26:24.199
Can we take a look
at the surveillance cameras?

26:24.201 --> 26:26.335
Sure.

26:27.904 --> 26:30.506
Lied about his alibi;
he said he was home alone.

26:30.508 --> 26:33.309
And as a doctor,
he has access to fentanyl.

26:33.311 --> 26:36.445
Yeah, motive and opportunity.
Two of my favorite words.

26:38.315 --> 26:40.482
This your girlfriend,
Dr. Garland?

26:40.484 --> 26:42.451
No.
No?

26:42.453 --> 26:44.153
You spent the night
with her, though.

26:44.155 --> 26:45.487
Same night
your wife died.

26:46.656 --> 26:47.957
Yes, she's a friend.

26:47.959 --> 26:50.659
A friend who stays over
when your wife's out of town?

26:50.661 --> 26:52.027
What are you getting at?

26:52.029 --> 26:53.562
What we're getting at
is that you lied!

26:53.564 --> 26:56.098
You weren't home
alone the night your wife was killed.

26:56.100 --> 26:59.501
I love my wife, Detective.
The only reason I lied is...

26:59.503 --> 27:01.737
Is because encouraging your wife
to get plastic surgery

27:01.739 --> 27:03.472
while you're running around
banging some younger broad

27:03.474 --> 27:06.508
would make you look like more
of an ass than you already are?

27:09.045 --> 27:12.848
I'm not answering any other
questions without a lawyer.

27:12.850 --> 27:15.684
Lot of that
going around.

27:21.324 --> 27:23.392
How many open cases
you got, Danny?

27:23.394 --> 27:28.297
I keep about seven
open cases in my desk drawer.

27:28.299 --> 27:31.000
It's the ones you don't solve
you always remember. I got ten.

27:31.002 --> 27:33.402
(groans) Why you ask, kid?

27:33.404 --> 27:35.637
No reason.

27:35.639 --> 27:37.940
Hey, how's your case going, Dad?

27:37.942 --> 27:40.209
I'm working hard on it,
little buddy.

27:40.211 --> 27:41.877
It's such a shame
that that woman--

27:41.879 --> 27:44.413
anyone, really, dying
from an elective surgery?

27:44.415 --> 27:45.848
DANNY:
Well...

27:45.850 --> 27:48.350
Why would someone have
a surgery they don't need?

27:48.352 --> 27:51.320
Women who want to look hot.
Yeah.

27:51.322 --> 27:53.789
I don't think big breasts
and pumped up lips are hot.

27:53.791 --> 27:54.890
I do.
ERIN: Oh, my.

27:54.892 --> 27:56.225
Jack.
Jack!

27:56.227 --> 27:58.460
(laughs) We're just calling it
like it is.

27:58.462 --> 28:01.296
NICKY: It's kind of sad,
though, going

28:01.298 --> 28:02.899
to all that trouble
just to look younger.

28:02.900 --> 28:07.903
Sad? No, sad is dying before
you see your kids grow up,

28:07.905 --> 28:09.872
before you see your grandkids
being born,

28:09.874 --> 28:11.607
and then your
great-grandkids.

28:11.609 --> 28:15.244
Growing old is a gift.

28:15.246 --> 28:20.115
So is being beautiful
and single,

28:20.117 --> 28:22.985
which is why
it's important to,

28:22.987 --> 28:24.920
you know, stay open to dating.

28:24.922 --> 28:28.924
Are we still talking
about plastic surgery here?

28:28.926 --> 28:30.559
I think we're talking about Mom.

28:30.561 --> 28:32.394
I don't need a man
to validate me.

28:32.396 --> 28:34.196
How about one
just to have dinner with?

28:34.198 --> 28:37.566
When did she become
such a matchmaker?

28:37.568 --> 28:38.700
I really don't know.

28:38.702 --> 28:40.269
I told her she's never
gonna find anybody

28:40.271 --> 28:42.071
a guy as good as me,
so what's the point?

28:42.073 --> 28:43.238
Hmm, so true.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.741
Danny, you ever have a time
where you felt like

28:45.743 --> 28:48.710
a case was unsolvable?
No, it hasn't happened yet, kid.

28:48.712 --> 28:50.879
What about any of those
seven open cases?

28:50.881 --> 28:53.182
I don't sleep
till I solve them.

28:53.184 --> 28:56.418
That's why I keep them alive
in my desk drawer.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.324
No wonder you wouldn't tell me.

29:03.426 --> 29:05.761
What?

29:09.699 --> 29:13.235
JAMIE: I'd like to introduce you
to Michelle Lowe.

29:13.237 --> 29:16.371
You were arrested about a week after
she was murdered.

29:16.373 --> 29:19.208
You copped to robberies
on either side of her building.

29:19.210 --> 29:21.076
So?
So, you said that

29:21.078 --> 29:23.278
you weren't responsible
for any of the robberies

29:23.280 --> 29:26.381
in her building.
Every place that you burglarized,

29:26.383 --> 29:31.320
you, uh, you went straight
for the jewelry and the cash,

29:31.322 --> 29:34.289
no DVD players,

29:34.291 --> 29:36.358
no TVs, no art,

29:36.360 --> 29:39.695
nothing you couldn't just
stick in your pocket.

29:39.697 --> 29:42.531
And I did my time for that.
I'm out of here in 64 days.

29:42.533 --> 29:44.032
I spent a lot of time

29:44.034 --> 29:47.202
looking at your robbery pattern
and Michelle Lowe's crime scene.

29:47.204 --> 29:48.537
You know what I noticed?

29:48.539 --> 29:51.540
I noticed that there was
no jewelry in her apartment

29:51.542 --> 29:53.609
and her bedroom window was open.

29:53.611 --> 29:57.079
So? A lot of people leave
their windows open.

29:57.081 --> 29:59.081
Yeah, you would know,
'cause that's how you enter.

29:59.083 --> 30:01.984
And then you hit the jewelry,
and then you exit

30:01.986 --> 30:03.552
through the front door.
Every time.

30:03.554 --> 30:05.120
I don't know why you're looking
to jam me up.

30:05.122 --> 30:07.389
I did my time.

30:08.224 --> 30:11.727
I'm not looking to jam you up.

30:11.729 --> 30:13.762
I'm looking for you to help me.

30:13.764 --> 30:17.733
Because I think that
you're a burglar, not a murderer.

30:17.735 --> 30:19.568
I would never kill someone.

30:19.570 --> 30:22.237
I believe you.

30:24.073 --> 30:26.441
But I think that you were there.

30:26.443 --> 30:29.611
That's why there was
no jewelry evident, and that's why

30:29.613 --> 30:31.413
you didn't cop
to a robbery in that building.

30:31.415 --> 30:33.682
So you can either
start talking to me,

30:33.684 --> 30:37.419
or I can start running all kinds
of fancy forensic tests...

30:37.421 --> 30:40.022
I didn't kill her.

30:40.024 --> 30:43.525
Okay, but you were there
that night, right?

30:45.795 --> 30:47.863
Hey, if you're honest with me,

30:47.865 --> 30:50.766
I can help you right now.

30:58.041 --> 31:02.177
I grabbed a bunch of stuff,
and I was on my way out.

31:02.179 --> 31:05.447
I walked into the living room,
and she was lying there.

31:06.983 --> 31:08.350
Blood everywhere.

31:08.352 --> 31:11.887
I knew she was dead.
It was creepy.

31:14.090 --> 31:16.491
I just shot out of there.

31:16.493 --> 31:18.160
You didn't think to tell anyone?

31:18.162 --> 31:20.562
(scoffs)
I know how it'd go down.

31:20.564 --> 31:22.564
They'd think, "He burglarized
her apartment.

31:22.566 --> 31:24.566
He probably killed her."

31:24.568 --> 31:26.201
That's some bad karma, man.

31:26.203 --> 31:30.906
I want you to tell me everything
and everyone that you saw.

31:30.908 --> 31:34.509
I didn't see anyone.

31:34.511 --> 31:38.413
The other two apartments
were quiet, lights out.

31:40.383 --> 31:43.151
The apartment across the hall,

31:43.153 --> 31:46.021
the lights were on and there was
loud music blasting.

31:48.124 --> 31:51.593
♪ Hey ya...

31:51.595 --> 31:53.795
♪ Hey ya.

31:53.797 --> 31:55.397
"Hey Ya" by Outkast.

31:55.399 --> 31:57.032
What time was that?

31:57.034 --> 32:00.435
Around midnight.

32:00.437 --> 32:03.405
To this day, I still
can't listen to that song.

32:18.988 --> 32:20.455
Hey.

32:20.457 --> 32:22.291
Hi.

32:23.126 --> 32:26.428
Please sit down.
(chuckles)

32:26.430 --> 32:29.164
I only opened
about six months ago,

32:29.166 --> 32:30.365
so I'm still only half unpacked.

32:30.367 --> 32:31.700
Why do I get
the impression,

32:31.702 --> 32:33.368
if you were open
for six years,

32:33.370 --> 32:35.537
it would look
the same?

32:35.539 --> 32:38.607
No, it would be
even more messy.

32:38.609 --> 32:43.412
Have to admit I'm more
of a super organized type-A person.

32:43.414 --> 32:44.880
Well, I'm one of those

32:44.882 --> 32:47.382
super-messy, piles-everywhere,

32:47.384 --> 32:49.184
but-I-know-where-everything-is-
type guys.

32:49.186 --> 32:52.054
Yet you have
an incredible success rate.

32:52.056 --> 32:54.456
It's also why I'm not
married, no girlfriend,

32:54.458 --> 32:59.428
and going to speed dating
in between court appearances.

32:59.430 --> 33:02.497
I looked up the prosecutor
on the Morales case.

33:02.499 --> 33:04.032
It was you.

33:05.501 --> 33:08.170
I was a Brooklyn A.D.A.
for 12 years.

33:08.172 --> 33:10.238
The Morales conviction
was the case

33:10.240 --> 33:12.541
that made me
become a defense attorney.

33:12.543 --> 33:15.210
You regretted convicting her?

33:15.212 --> 33:18.513
I went for the highest charge.

33:18.515 --> 33:20.315
I refused to negotiate.

33:20.317 --> 33:23.752
Even when the legal aide lawyer
told me she thought Morales

33:23.754 --> 33:26.722
was a victim
of an abusive relationship,

33:26.724 --> 33:28.857
I wouldn't entertain a plea.

33:28.859 --> 33:30.459
There's nothing wrong

33:30.461 --> 33:32.761
with sticking
to the letter of the law.

33:34.030 --> 33:37.165
Later her boyfriend recanted.

33:37.167 --> 33:39.634
And admitted that Morales
really didn't know

33:39.636 --> 33:41.269
anything about the assault.

33:41.271 --> 33:43.872
She wasn't even there.

33:43.874 --> 33:46.908
But the judge on the case
didn't believe him.

33:46.910 --> 33:49.211
And the conviction stayed.

33:49.213 --> 33:50.712
And then she did her time.

33:50.714 --> 33:52.080
She stayed clean.

33:52.082 --> 33:54.383
Until hooking up with Sandoval.

33:54.385 --> 33:56.651
Well, I did look into his past.

33:56.653 --> 33:59.521
He had a sealed record,
which I unsealed.

33:59.523 --> 34:00.956
Gun possession charge,

34:00.958 --> 34:02.759
which he blamed
on his girlfriend at the time.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.626
Said it was hers,
not his.

34:04.628 --> 34:06.962
Sounds familiar.
Mm-hmm.

34:06.964 --> 34:09.931
If your client agrees
to go through

34:09.933 --> 34:12.000
a residential
drug treatment program

34:12.002 --> 34:13.969
and community service,

34:13.971 --> 34:16.737
I'll knock the charge
down to criminal possession.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.409
That would be great.

34:20.411 --> 34:22.476
Thank you so much.

34:22.478 --> 34:24.880
You're welcome.

34:24.882 --> 34:27.248
You're good.

34:27.251 --> 34:29.016
You should double your fee.

34:29.018 --> 34:30.985
I'm doing this pro bono.

34:30.987 --> 34:33.989
You should triple it then.

34:38.594 --> 34:39.795
MAN:
<i>Mrs. Garland</i>

34:39.797 --> 34:41.295
checked in on Wednesday night.

34:41.297 --> 34:42.464
Checked out

34:42.466 --> 34:43.965
on Thursday.

34:43.967 --> 34:46.333
She was scheduled
to stay the whole week.

34:46.335 --> 34:47.869
That's correct.

34:47.871 --> 34:49.804
Well, she say
why she was leaving early?

34:49.806 --> 34:52.174
She said she decided
to return home.

34:52.176 --> 34:54.208
Can we see
your security camera footage

34:54.210 --> 34:55.677
for her check-in and checkout?

34:55.679 --> 34:56.844
No problem.

35:01.317 --> 35:03.718
DANNY:
What's with the hat and glasses?

35:03.720 --> 35:05.086
It's not that unusual
for someone

35:05.088 --> 35:07.289
who just had cosmetic surgery.

35:09.325 --> 35:12.360
Hold on,
freeze that right there.

35:13.396 --> 35:14.563
Zoom in on that.

35:14.565 --> 35:17.032
Right on her hand.

35:17.034 --> 35:19.100
The manicure?

35:19.102 --> 35:20.669
Yeah, I've seen that before.

35:20.671 --> 35:23.171
It's the ju... the nurse!

35:23.173 --> 35:24.873
The nurse in Dr.
Levine's office.

35:24.875 --> 35:26.775
Sh-She had the same manicure!

35:28.244 --> 35:31.046
Son of a bitch.

35:41.065 --> 35:42.766
I think I should call
Dr. Levine.

35:42.768 --> 35:45.368
And I think you
should have a seat.

35:45.370 --> 35:47.070
Dr. Levine can't help you
with the charges. Sit down.

35:47.072 --> 35:49.906
What charges?
Obstruction of justice, manslaughter.

35:49.908 --> 35:50.807
Manslaughter?

35:50.809 --> 35:53.243
I didn't kill anyone.

35:53.245 --> 35:55.733
You said Mrs. Garland was fine
before she left your office.

35:55.734 --> 35:56.265
She was.

35:56.290 --> 35:57.882
Then why did you
check out of the hotel

35:57.883 --> 35:59.349
using her name?

36:01.252 --> 36:03.820
It seems you have a decision
to make, young lady.

36:03.822 --> 36:06.556
And I suggest you make
it kind of fast.

36:06.558 --> 36:08.224
You'll either go down
as an accomplice for murder

36:08.226 --> 36:09.859
with Dr. Levine.

36:09.861 --> 36:11.227
Or you're gonna cooperate
and make a deal.

36:11.229 --> 36:13.129
I've never hurt a patient
in my life.

36:13.131 --> 36:14.164
Until Mrs. Garland.

36:14.166 --> 36:15.131
I didn't hurt her.

36:15.133 --> 36:16.132
Neither did Dr. Levine.

36:16.134 --> 36:17.300
Right.
N...

36:17.302 --> 36:18.401
No.

36:18.403 --> 36:19.536
The procedure went well.

36:19.538 --> 36:20.770
She was in recovery

36:20.772 --> 36:22.238
when she complained of pain.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.706
The anesthesiologist had left.

36:23.708 --> 36:25.208
It was just me and Dr. Levine.

36:25.210 --> 36:26.409
So, what happened?

36:26.411 --> 36:29.679
He gave her fentanyl
to ease the pain.

36:29.681 --> 36:32.015
She had a reaction.

36:32.017 --> 36:33.783
Started gasping for breath.

36:33.785 --> 36:34.784
We tried to save her.

36:34.786 --> 36:35.985
How?

36:35.987 --> 36:37.153
He tried to resuscitate her.

36:37.155 --> 36:38.688
Nothing worked.

36:38.690 --> 36:40.089
Dr. Levine panicked.

36:40.091 --> 36:41.624
You didn't call 911?

36:41.626 --> 36:42.792
He begged me.

36:42.794 --> 36:44.994
He was already under review
for another patient.

36:44.996 --> 36:47.564
And he was afraid
he'd lose his license.

36:47.566 --> 36:49.165
Right.

36:49.167 --> 36:51.901
As opposed to say...

36:51.903 --> 36:53.903
losing a life?

37:00.544 --> 37:03.546
I thought Joyce and I
answered everything.

37:03.548 --> 37:04.881
And you have, and
I appreciate it.

37:04.883 --> 37:06.916
But the investigation raised
some more questions.

37:06.918 --> 37:09.319
Oh, what kind of questions?

37:09.321 --> 37:10.653
Just want to make sure
I have my facts straight.

37:10.655 --> 37:12.422
Your wife was out
and you were home.

37:12.424 --> 37:15.225
Yeah, but I told you before,
I didn't hear anything.

37:15.227 --> 37:18.461
Yeah, and you were asleep
by about 10:00?

37:18.463 --> 37:19.696
That's right.

37:19.698 --> 37:20.730
So, I'm just wondering

37:20.732 --> 37:22.031
why the lights were on
in your apartment

37:22.033 --> 37:23.900
and music was blasting
at midnight?

37:23.902 --> 37:26.402
Maybe when my wife came home?

37:26.404 --> 37:28.004
No, she wasn't home until 1:00.

37:28.006 --> 37:30.673
Oh.

37:30.675 --> 37:33.109
But, hey.

37:33.111 --> 37:34.377
It was ten years ago, right?

37:34.379 --> 37:35.912
I-I can't remember
what I had for breakfast.

37:35.914 --> 37:37.513
Maybe you just forgot
what time it was.

37:37.515 --> 37:39.315
Right, maybe I went
to bed later.

Mm-hmm.

38:13.885 --> 38:15.685
And she was friendly with you,

you all really do look good
just the way you are, you know.

40:45.569 --> 40:46.869
McCOY:
I just dropped Morales off

40:46.871 --> 40:48.738
at rehab.

40:48.740 --> 40:51.274
I think this time
she's gonna stay straight.

40:51.276 --> 40:52.542
I hope you're right.

40:52.544 --> 40:54.210
I just wish they had
a rehab program

40:54.212 --> 40:56.412
to get you off
of loser boyfriends.

40:56.414 --> 40:57.947
Yeah, they don't. I've checked.

40:57.949 --> 41:00.817
Can I buy you dinner?

41:00.819 --> 41:02.985
Oh, you don't have to do that.

41:02.987 --> 41:04.220
Do what?

41:04.222 --> 41:06.222
Buy me anything as a thank you.

41:06.224 --> 41:08.758
I made the plea based on the
merits of the case, not on you.

41:08.760 --> 41:11.227
I wasn't asking you out
to thank you.

41:11.229 --> 41:14.230
I was asking you out
because I like you.

41:15.632 --> 41:17.433
Or think I might.

41:17.435 --> 41:18.701
Oh, you think you might?

41:18.703 --> 41:19.869
Well, given the chance.

41:19.871 --> 41:21.037
Uh-huh.

41:21.039 --> 41:22.405
You might like me, too.

41:22.407 --> 41:24.740
Yeah, based on what evidence?

41:24.742 --> 41:27.143
All right, you
got me there.

41:27.145 --> 41:29.612
But I make my living
pleading lost causes.

41:29.614 --> 41:32.081
So I'll ask one more time.

41:32.083 --> 41:34.083
May I buy you dinner?

41:35.619 --> 41:38.054
Yes.

41:48.765 --> 41:50.133
One thing I was wondering.

41:50.135 --> 41:52.468
What made you go
to the super?

41:52.470 --> 41:54.370
Just a hunch.

41:55.873 --> 41:59.041
I wouldn't have
thought to go there.

41:59.043 --> 42:01.577
You'd make a
good detective.

42:01.579 --> 42:03.079
To be honest,
I'm not really sure

42:03.081 --> 42:04.447
which way I want to go yet.

42:04.449 --> 42:08.417
Well... if you decide
to make a move,

42:08.419 --> 42:09.986
I know the PC.

42:09.988 --> 42:12.221
That's a good hook to have.

42:12.223 --> 42:15.925
So I heard.

42:15.927 --> 42:18.327
Michelle's mother
has been waiting

42:18.329 --> 42:20.530
for this day for ten years.

42:22.633 --> 42:24.867
It might be a relief.

42:24.869 --> 42:27.537
Or a disappointment
or a comfort.

42:27.539 --> 42:31.007
Or all of the above.

42:31.009 --> 42:33.009
Just tell her the truth.

42:33.011 --> 42:34.977
Everything that happened.

42:36.580 --> 42:38.047
You're not coming?

42:38.049 --> 42:40.917
No.

42:40.919 --> 42:43.419
It's your case.

42:46.123 --> 42:49.091
Thanks, Dad.
