00:13.881 --> 00:15.549
I can't believe
 you guys made me do this.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.751
- Oh, my God. I can't
 believe I said yes, either.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.820
- Welcome aboard.
 - Washie-washie.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.323
Come on, kids,
 follow me!

00:22.390 --> 00:24.892
- This way, please.
 - Josh, why are you
 so bummed out?

00:24.958 --> 00:26.494
- This is going to be fun.
 - Congratulations.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.263
It's fabulous.
I finally have my
whole brood together.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.999
Keep me away from this
 family frivolity shit

00:32.066 --> 00:33.434
'cause I can't deal
with it right now.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.769
Wait, honey, honey, you
have to do the hand thing.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.705
- Oh.
 - Washie-washie.
 - Welcome aboard.

00:37.771 --> 00:40.108
Who knew we'd both
 be single again?

00:40.174 --> 00:42.410
But maybe there's a--

00:42.476 --> 00:45.613
a reason,
 or it's beshert.

00:45.679 --> 00:46.914
It's a lovely boat.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.349
Something that we
don't understand.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.717
Ship.
 Call it a ship.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.452
- What?
 - Ship. We call it a ship.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.621
- What's the difference?
 - It's a matter of respect.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.456
Matter of respect.
 Okay, I get that.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.359
I said I feel like
I'm having a hot
flash, it's so hot.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.993
Oh, God,
we're losing the kids.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.463
- Oh.
- Hey, hey, hey. Sarah.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.298
Josh! Ali!

01:52.313 --> 01:54.047
- How do we
get our luggage?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.283
Let me make sure we're going
 in the right direction.

01:55.349 --> 01:56.550
How many Pfeffermans
 does it take

01:56.617 --> 01:58.118
to figure out where
the fuck our rooms are?

01:58.186 --> 01:59.320
We're going to be very
close to each other.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.621
Which is good because
then we can knock

02:00.688 --> 02:02.290
on each other's door
in the night.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.524
We're all--
 Evens are on the right.

02:03.591 --> 02:04.992
Here I am.
I'm going to go
for a plop-down

02:05.058 --> 02:06.194
because I'm zebroilzled.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.628
Okay. W--

02:07.695 --> 02:09.029
Wait. I'm seeing

02:09.096 --> 02:10.864
that I'm on a different
level than you.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.633
I'm going
to check on that.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.303
Everybody get unpacked
 and meet for dinner at 6.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.171
You got that? Yeah.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.707
God, I feel so bad.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.409
Mom's alone again.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.610
That's why we had to
 come on this trip:

02:22.676 --> 02:25.713
because
Mom would actually
die if we didn't.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.241
Hello, Shelly.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.143
Welcome to the Garden Villa
 in the Haven.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.411
I am Trevor,
 your personal butler,

02:57.478 --> 02:59.813
and I'm here to make
everything smooth,

02:59.880 --> 03:02.783
fabulous, and easy
 for you and Mr. Rachlis.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.555
Mr. Rachlis and I
just broke up,

03:07.621 --> 03:11.525
so I won't be
able to have this
extravagant space

03:11.592 --> 03:14.094
all for myself
 because it's too much.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.529
I'll have to change
my room. Thank you.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.831
No, there's no need
 to do that.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.000
Being on a cruise
 is the perfect thing

03:20.067 --> 03:21.469
- for a breakup, girl, okay?

03:21.535 --> 03:24.238
And this is the perfect
suite to luxuriate.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.707
I can book you a massage.
 We've got acupuncture.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.142
Perhaps you'd like
a little mani-pedi,

03:29.209 --> 03:31.845
teeth whitening,
a saline Jacuzzi.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.048
Shel,
 let me ask you this.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.384
When was the last time

03:36.450 --> 03:38.586
you took
some "you" time?

03:38.652 --> 03:40.621
Is that the same
 as "me" time?

03:40.688 --> 03:42.290
Yeah.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.780
I have a surprise
 for everyone.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.883
There's something
that I want to show you

04:09.950 --> 04:12.353
after dinner.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.324
I think we were supposed
 to download this app
 at home, guys.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.959
If we don't do this,
 we won't be able to keep
 in touch with each other.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.428
Done with this
 farshtinkener phone.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.029
- Doesn't work for me.
 - Forget it.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.964
So? Where's Joshie?

04:24.031 --> 04:25.065
He's freestyling.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.567
He's not feeling well?

04:26.634 --> 04:28.035
- He's freestyling.
- No one said that, Mom.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.703
He's doing what he wants.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.105
Why does someone always
get sick on vacation?

04:32.172 --> 04:34.007
Who had the singles
in San Francisco?

04:34.074 --> 04:35.609
- Oh, no.
 - That wasn't San Francisco.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.910
San Francisco's
 where I had strep.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.278
- Really?
 - Yeah.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.713
That's right.
You got off the plane.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.181
All the way
from the airport

04:41.248 --> 04:42.316
straight to Aunt Bryna's
 for the Seder.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.051
Oh, and that was the Pesach

04:44.117 --> 04:45.553
that Maura and Bryna
 had that big fight.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.621
Because you took her side.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.157
And then we never had another
 Seder after that. Why not?

04:50.223 --> 04:52.960
Because Pesach and Seder
 were always Aunt Bryna's.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.729
That's so stupid.
Passover doesn't
belong to a person.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.332
Our dining room table
wasn't big enough
for everybody.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.868
I-- I couldn't find
 the leaves for the table.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.103
Why do you do that?
 I don't want that.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.304
Because I just don't
 need all this.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.639
One of you
 had chicken pox.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.608
- Then don't eat it.
- Who had chicken pox?

05:07.675 --> 05:09.276
- No, but I didn't-- No.
 - Did you have chicken pox?

05:09.343 --> 05:10.478
Because if I eat it--

05:10.544 --> 05:11.845
it's on my own plate
and I eat it,

05:11.912 --> 05:13.814
you know how quickly
I put on weight.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.148
I don't think
Ali wants something

05:15.215 --> 05:16.350
with your mouth
moisture on it.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.785
Especially when
there's literally

05:17.851 --> 05:19.319
3,000 delicious
things to eat

05:19.387 --> 05:20.788
in every direction
 on this boat.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.656
It's not a boat.
 It's a ship.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.191
- You have to say ship.
- Ship.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.258
You can't misgender the ship.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.760
You know what?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.061
I don't want to miss
 the magic show,

05:28.128 --> 05:29.397
so I got to go.

05:35.035 --> 05:38.071
So, guys, I need to show you
 something after dinner.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.673
I'm going to go
find Yoshi.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.509
Bye. Thanks.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.545
Bye.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.853
Shingles in Nova Scotia.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.223
One of the kids had
 shingles in Nova Scotia.

05:56.289 --> 06:00.561
Mm-hmm. I think I
 blocked out Nova Scotia.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.315
Mom?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.051
- Oh, my God.
 - Oh, my God.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.086
- Look at this.
 - Fuck balls. What?

06:26.153 --> 06:28.656
This is her room? Ha!

06:28.722 --> 06:30.858
This is incredible.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.159
- She has a piano.
 - Fruit?

06:32.225 --> 06:33.994
We don't have a fruit bowl.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.263
Mom, why didn't you
tell us about this?

06:36.329 --> 06:37.965
How did you get in here?

06:38.031 --> 06:39.900
Oh, I accidentally picked up
 your key at dinner.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.368
Yeah, well,
 this was the surprise

06:41.435 --> 06:43.103
I was going to tell you
 about at dinner last night,

06:43.170 --> 06:45.473
but you all
 treated me so horribly
 that I decided not to.

06:45.539 --> 06:46.807
We didn't treat you
 so horribly.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.108
- What are you talking about?
 - Yes, you did.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.810
You treat me horribly
 most of the time.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.211
So listen,
 why don't you just go?

06:51.278 --> 06:53.013
- Come on.
- You're kicking us out?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.683
Yes. This is my place.
 this is my time.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.951
This is me
 pampering myself.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.053
I'm going
 to have a massage
 and a mani-pedi,

07:00.120 --> 07:01.822
and I'm going
 to indulge myself.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.692
Trevor is teaching me
 about self-care.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.794
Who the fuck is Trevor?

07:06.860 --> 07:09.463
Trevor is the gay
 who comes with the room.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.665
Wow. I didn't get a gay
 with my room.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.400
Did you get
 a gay with your room?

07:13.467 --> 07:15.235
You can go now. Go ahead.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.670
Okay.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.240
Bye. Enjoy your massage.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.909
I will.

07:25.513 --> 07:28.248
- Mr. Amazing man!

07:28.315 --> 07:31.451
Whoo! Look at him.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.986
Nice, buddy.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.723
All right.
 Let me ask all the guys

07:35.789 --> 07:37.858
to line up one more time
 right there.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.660
Everybody,
 face the pool area.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.462
I don't know. I think,
 like, my ex and I

07:42.530 --> 07:44.532
are, like, best friends
 or something,

07:44.598 --> 07:47.367
but it just--
 to be honest, Lisa,

07:47.434 --> 07:50.103
I just can't tell
 if he's my person

07:50.170 --> 07:51.672
or do I just want him
 to be my person.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.075
What's the difference,
 you know?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.311
I guess. I don't know.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.980
What about you
 and your hubby?

08:00.047 --> 08:01.414
I mean, I'm assuming
 you're straight

08:01.481 --> 08:02.816
because I shouldn't--
 I'm--

08:02.883 --> 08:04.652
No. Um...

08:06.754 --> 08:08.989
I'm not really straight.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.592
I don't know.
We have a kind of a...

08:11.659 --> 08:14.361
forward-thinking,
modern thing going on.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.997
I mean, as long as you're
 being so candid,

08:17.064 --> 08:19.232
we actually, um--
between you and me--

08:21.001 --> 08:22.035
we swing.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.771
- Okay, wait.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.606
Like you let each other
 hook up with other people?

08:25.673 --> 08:29.342
No. No. We hook up
with other couples.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.912
I mean, at home
we have our people,

08:31.979 --> 08:34.514
and then,
when we're, you know,
on vacations like this,

08:34.582 --> 08:37.350
we kind of
keep our eyes open

08:37.417 --> 08:41.054
for couples who
might be into us.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.324
Sounds kind of complicated.

08:44.391 --> 08:47.460
Mm, well,
just complicated enough

08:47.527 --> 08:49.129
to keep life
 interesting, you know?

08:51.632 --> 08:52.900
Hey, babe.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.802
- Hey. Everything okay?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.304
Yeah. Yeah. I just...

08:57.370 --> 08:59.172
want to tell you
 that I missed you.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.441
- Aw. You, too, loser.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.076
Hey, I'm going to put you
 on speaker phone.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.112
Guys, come here, real quick.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.614
- Guess who it is.
 - Is it Mom?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.015
I'll give you a hint.
 It's Mommy.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.549
- Mommy!
 - Say "Hi, Mommy."

09:09.617 --> 09:11.284
- Mommy, hi, Mommy!
- Tell her the big news.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.853
We got big news
 over here.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.155
- We got a new pet turtle!
 - Yeah.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.591
- And also, Zacky
 .. pooped all by himself
 on a play date.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.226
Hey, I wanted
 to tell her that.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.327
Big news, right?

09:20.393 --> 09:21.595
Do you believe that?

09:21.662 --> 09:23.363
Oh, sweetie,
I'm so proud of you.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.898
I'm so happy to hear
all of that.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.034
Yeah. All right,
 say we love you, guys.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.168
- Love you, Mommy.
- Love you, Mommy.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.169
We love you, Mommy.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.804
I love you guys.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.673
I'll see you soon.
 I love you.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.042
- Okay. Bye.
 - Later, Mom.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.483
So.

09:43.550 --> 09:44.618
Hmm?

09:44.685 --> 09:45.753
Everything okay?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.354
Yeah. I'm fine.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.825
I'm not fine.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.628
I miss Mr. Rachlis.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.664
He would have loved
 all of this,

09:56.730 --> 09:58.699
especially the food.

10:00.533 --> 10:03.804
He was my port in a storm.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.239
He believed in me.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.208
He liked my singing.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.177
- You sing.
 - Mm-hmm.

10:10.243 --> 10:13.914
We were actually working
 on a one-woman show for me.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.884
I'm sorry. Did you just
say one-woman show?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.852
Yeah. Yeah.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.888
Why am I just
finding out about this?

10:20.954 --> 10:23.290
I have connections
at the Spinnaker Lounge

10:23.356 --> 10:25.693
right here on the ship.
It's world famous.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.194
Barry Manilow
has played there.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.628
I can make this happen.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.030
Wait, wait, wait. I-- I--

10:30.097 --> 10:32.565
I could do my one-woman
 show on this boat?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.001
On the-- this ship, yes.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.368
- This ship?
 - Yes.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.963
Looking for something
 in particular?

11:03.030 --> 11:06.099
Hi.
 This is wonderful.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.935
Is this for men
or for women?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.169
For both, either.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.403
What do you think?

11:10.470 --> 11:11.872
It's very, very nice.

11:11.939 --> 11:14.908
Is this what they call
 at-leisure wear?

11:14.975 --> 11:17.978
Sort of like
 a Boca Raton matriarch

11:18.045 --> 11:20.513
or a, I don't know,
like a...

11:20.580 --> 11:24.317
hip-hop rapper...
thingie?

11:24.384 --> 11:25.986
- It's for everyone.
 - Can I try it on?

11:26.053 --> 11:27.721
Sure.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.304
Hi.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.773
Hi.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.608
- You look incredible.
 - Thank you.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.210
Yeah.

11:50.277 --> 11:53.847
This is-- This is
 a fabulous new look for you.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.282
What's going on?

11:55.348 --> 11:57.650
Just, uh,

11:57.717 --> 11:59.686
I'm saying goodbye
 to my Spandex

11:59.753 --> 12:02.756
and to my feminine
 shapewear.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.425
This one has
my tuchus in it.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.127
Why?

12:07.194 --> 12:09.196
Uh...

12:13.266 --> 12:16.336
I can't--
I can't get my surgery.

12:17.504 --> 12:18.738
Why?

12:18.806 --> 12:20.507
Apparently,
if you're my age

12:20.573 --> 12:21.875
and there's a little
 whoop-dee-doo

12:21.942 --> 12:23.676
on your heart machine
 record,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.045
they will not
let you go under,

12:25.112 --> 12:26.713
and there is a little
 whoop-dee-doo

12:26.780 --> 12:28.381
on my heart machine
record,

12:28.448 --> 12:30.450
so I think it's one
 thing to wear this stuff

12:30.517 --> 12:32.685
if you, uh, know

12:32.752 --> 12:34.922
you are going
 to transform into...

12:37.724 --> 12:39.993
a new shape, but, uh,

12:40.060 --> 12:41.661
otherwise, it just
 feels like a costume.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.964
It feels like I'm hiding.
 It feels like--

12:45.498 --> 12:46.666
It feels wrong.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.501
Now, I have to do
more tests,

12:48.568 --> 12:50.570
and I have to go
off hormones,
which I've done,

12:50.637 --> 12:52.840
and I feel like I'm...

12:53.874 --> 12:55.508
like I'm nothing.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.244
Like I feel nothing.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.379
It sucks.

12:59.446 --> 13:04.918
And now I don't even know
what or who I want anymore.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.154
Wait, so you're not
 transitioning?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.322
I've already transitioned.
 I'm trans.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.958
I'm just--

13:13.426 --> 13:14.561
This is me.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.931
This is it.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.368
Well, let's--

13:24.171 --> 13:25.338
let's say a prayer.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.807
- Can I?
- Do it.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.110
This is your butt?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.244
This was my butt.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.513
Take this.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.482
- Okay, ready?
 - Ready.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.920
Face the ocean
 and raise your arms.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.291
Great Mystery,

13:44.357 --> 13:45.993
Goddess,

13:46.059 --> 13:50.463
let us mark this moment
 to say goodbye to these

13:50.530 --> 13:53.600
tight, terrible Spanx.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.036
Goodbye, tight,
terrible Spanx.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.573
Deliver us from feeling...

14:02.175 --> 14:03.476
bunched up in the ass!

14:03.543 --> 14:04.777
Dayenu!

14:04.844 --> 14:06.846
And restricted and confined!

14:06.914 --> 14:08.916
Let us just be!

14:10.417 --> 14:11.684
Set us free!

14:11.751 --> 14:13.320
Set us--

14:13.386 --> 14:14.621
- Free!

14:17.090 --> 14:19.192
You know what? I'm worried
 about the little birdies

14:19.259 --> 14:21.628
getting caught up in this
 like a little straitjacket
 or something.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.130
- We can't do it.
 - Oh, God. Here.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.331
There.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.117
Here you go.

14:48.688 --> 14:49.957
Hi.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.624
- Hey. What's up?
- How are you?

14:51.691 --> 14:54.027
I'm pretty good.
 How are you?

14:54.094 --> 14:57.197
I'm okay. 24 black.
 Did you just win?

14:57.264 --> 14:58.932
Yeah. I'm up. A lot.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.033
- A lot?
- A lot.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.401
Place your bets.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.769
You should start
 betting numbers.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.004
I don't do numbers.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.572
These are really good
 numbers:

15:05.638 --> 15:07.007
3, 9, 18, 36. I promise
 they'll win. Please?

15:07.074 --> 15:09.176
- I'm serious.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.343
These are very powerful.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.444
Play one of mine.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.612
- Really?
 - Yeah.

15:12.679 --> 15:13.780
- I can play this?
 - Yeah.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.282
You can put it
wherever you want.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.651
Okay. Um, should I
 do 3 or 36?

15:18.718 --> 15:20.253
Or should I do 18?

15:20.320 --> 15:21.921
No, I'm going to do 36.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.056
Do it.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.392
Here.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.294
We're going to bet them all.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.396
- What?
- Bet them all.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.797
- Really?
 - Yeah.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.132
We're going to bet it all.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.333
- Do it. Why not?
 - Okay.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.035
I'm going to start with 3

15:35.102 --> 15:37.404
* Because you just
 wrecked the binary *

15:37.470 --> 15:39.672
And three 3's is 9,
 and you double that
 and have 18,

15:39.739 --> 15:41.308
and two 18's is 36.
 36.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.742
All right, here we go.
 Let's go. Drop, drop.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.544
- Okay! Okay!
 - No more bets. No more bets.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.612
Okay. Okay.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.615
Wait until you see this.

15:54.254 --> 15:57.524
22 black. 22 black.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.629
What do you mean, that's it?

16:02.695 --> 16:03.930
We don't get another spin?

16:03.997 --> 16:05.565
No.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.501
Oh, my God.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.905
How much money was that?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.907
Josh, how much money was that?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.509
How much money
was that?

16:16.576 --> 16:17.810
$25,000.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.512
Oh, my God. What?

16:19.579 --> 16:22.682
Why did you just
let me bet $25,000?

16:22.749 --> 16:24.017
I don't know
what I'm doing.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.056
I'm so sorry.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.858
I'm so sorry.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.460
Fuck.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.729
What do we do?

16:38.031 --> 16:39.399
What do you want to do?

16:39.466 --> 16:41.601
I want to go be by myself.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.038
No, you can't be by yourself.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.640
I came on this cruise
 to be with you.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.209
Really?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.044
- Yeah, really.
 - That's bullshit.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.345
No, it's not.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.281
You came on this cruise
to escape Leslie.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.482
No, that's bullshit.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.350
And you also came
to Overland Park

16:57.417 --> 16:59.719
- to escape Leslie.
 - Oh, please!

16:59.786 --> 17:02.155
You were losing your mind,
 and I came, and I saved you.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.157
You didn't save me.
 You're making shit up
 in your fucking head.

17:05.224 --> 17:07.727
I didn't ask you
to pick me up
from Overland Park.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.496
Okay?

17:09.561 --> 17:10.696
I'm not your fucking
 boyfriend.

17:10.762 --> 17:11.598
You're my sister.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.900
I want to be normal.

17:13.965 --> 17:15.435
I want to have
my own family,

17:15.502 --> 17:18.405
and I'm-- this--
 this is fucking it up.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.340
So you need
to go that way,

17:21.407 --> 17:23.510
and I'm going to go
this way.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.249
Sarah, get up, get up.
 I have an idea.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.383
- What?
 - I need your help.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.584
I want to do a Seder.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.419
Oh, no.
 I'm not doing a Seder.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.255
- Please?
 - No, no, no.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.157
- Why?
 - Because I'm over
 the henani shit.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.758
I've never-- I'm done,
 okay? I'm a bad Jew.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.526
It doesn't
 have to be like that.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.495
- Why do you want a Seder?
 - because we need it.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.029
We're together
on this boat,

18:17.096 --> 18:18.798
and it's the last
 night of Passover,

18:18.865 --> 18:21.033
and I just want
 to gather together
 in a circle

18:21.100 --> 18:23.570
and just have one moment
 of being connected.

18:24.571 --> 18:25.572
Please.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.708
I don't have a Seder
 plate or anything.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.615
- I just checked--
 - Starboard, bow.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.750
Then it's the 12th floor,
 not the 10th.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.486
Look.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.920
Give me the plate.
 Give me the plate.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.289
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Here, here.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.257
Hey, we can use
saltines for matzo.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.825
- Okay.
- Uh...

18:45.892 --> 18:47.126
Oh, bone.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.895
- Oh, bone.
 - Bone.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.232
Oh. Perfect.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.267
- Parsley.
 - For what?

18:54.334 --> 18:56.102
- Charoset.
 - Charoset.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.171
- Uh, nuts--
- Nuts, raisins.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.139
- Yeah. And--
 - Okay. Nuts and raisins.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.408
They don't
have wine here.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.609
Vinegar. Get vinegar.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.911
Vinegar. That is
such a good idea.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.449
Okay, that's good.
 That's good.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.484
- Bitter herbs.
 - Here's your wasabi.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.585
- Thank you.
- It's perfect.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.354
- That's great.
- Thank you.

19:18.958 --> 19:22.195
Okay, um, let's all
 take a moment

19:22.262 --> 19:23.863
to take a few deep breaths.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.433
Ground yourself.

19:26.499 --> 19:30.737
And, um, just be grateful

19:30.803 --> 19:33.306
that we're all
 gathered together,

19:33.373 --> 19:36.909
invited by
 the feminine spirit,

19:36.976 --> 19:38.411
She who holds space,

19:38.478 --> 19:43.049
and we're going
 to name this moment

19:43.115 --> 19:49.556
and mark this tradition
of our people,

19:49.622 --> 19:51.591
the Jewish people.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.794
So today,
 before the sun goes down,

19:54.861 --> 19:59.366
we're going to taste the foods
 of the ritual platter.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.433
- What is that?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.534
That's the charoset.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.769
- What's wasabi.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.036
That's beautiful.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.405
- Thank you.
 - It is.

20:13.880 --> 20:14.847
Well done.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.250
- Oh, my God.

20:19.252 --> 20:23.290
Wow, you really get
 the bitterness of being
 a slave on that one.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.058
- Okay, so--

20:26.125 --> 20:28.160
- You okay?

20:28.227 --> 20:30.597
Ali and I decided that we
 were going to do this

20:30.663 --> 20:32.399
like the Seder that Raquel
 and I came up with

20:32.465 --> 20:34.734
for henani-- Sorry.
I don't want to trigger.

20:34.801 --> 20:35.968
Of course not.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.370
We were going to do this thing

20:37.437 --> 20:38.771
where you sit across
 the table from people

20:38.838 --> 20:40.473
and you tell them...

20:40.540 --> 20:42.809
you know, what you
 feel enslaved by,

20:42.875 --> 20:46.212
like what we needed
 to be freed from.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.814
Would you guys
 want to do that?

20:47.880 --> 20:49.215
- Yeah.
 - Yeah. Let's do it.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.283
- Good.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.751
I got to go.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.724
Let him go.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.466
- And then there were four.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.967
You know what?
Maybe we just
shouldn't do this.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.236
- Okay.
 - No. We're doing it.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.971
- Okay, let's do it.
 Moppa, you go.

21:12.038 --> 21:15.608
All right. Um, I was on
the deck of this ship,

21:15.675 --> 21:18.878
and I was looking out
 at the vastness of the ocean,

21:18.945 --> 21:20.380
and it was overwhelming,

21:20.447 --> 21:22.415
so what I did
 to steady myself

21:22.482 --> 21:24.851
was I imagined a point
 way, way out there,

21:24.917 --> 21:27.987
and I imagined
 how deep it would go,

21:28.054 --> 21:30.757
and of course it would
 go on forever.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.593
And then I just sort of get
 the vastness of the ocean--

21:33.660 --> 21:36.329
I mean, of all oceans, and...

21:40.333 --> 21:43.370
in that moment I can
understand my pain...

21:46.339 --> 21:48.808
and the size of my fear.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.813
My actual self is so...

21:54.981 --> 21:56.583
tied up with it.

22:00.252 --> 22:01.854
With shame.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.429
Uh, get back to me.

22:16.068 --> 22:19.005
I, uh, I'm going to go.

22:20.072 --> 22:21.273
Uh...

22:21.340 --> 22:23.643
Could you please be fast?

22:23.710 --> 22:25.912
I have a hard out at 6:30.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.580
- What?
 - Where are you going?

22:27.647 --> 22:29.048
You have to tell
 your story.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.817
- We're trying
 to connect here.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.387
You want me to tell my story?

22:34.454 --> 22:36.322
- Yeah.
- Okay.

22:36.389 --> 22:37.857
My story is--

22:39.492 --> 22:43.129
I am not at home
in this family.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.498
You ridicule me.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.435
You bond with each other
behind my back.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.573
You roll your eyes at me.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.574
We do not roll our eyes.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.409
You-- You just did it.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.877
You just did it.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.946
She's right.
 You roll your eyes.

23:00.012 --> 23:03.315
Thank you once
for sticking up for me.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.518
You know, when Buzzy left,

23:05.585 --> 23:07.954
I thought that no one would
 ever believe in me again.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.922
But then I met Trevor.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.558
Who's Trevor?

23:11.624 --> 23:13.793
He's the gay who comes
 with my room.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.395
I am on a completely
 different level.

23:16.463 --> 23:20.132
I get a poached egg on demand.

23:20.199 --> 23:24.771
Anyway, I auditioned my
 one-woman show for Trevor,

23:24.837 --> 23:26.639
and he thinks
 it's strong enough

23:26.706 --> 23:31.210
to be performed
 in the world-famous,

23:31.277 --> 23:34.013
renowned Spinnaker Lounge.

23:35.448 --> 23:38.618
So if you want
to hear my story,

23:38.685 --> 23:42.622
my story wants
to be heard by you.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.928
Tonight at 6:45.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.330
- 6:45.

23:51.397 --> 23:52.632
I go on at 7,

23:52.699 --> 23:55.201
but you have to get
your seat by 6:45.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.709
You get a gay with your room?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.043
Only on her level.

24:21.127 --> 24:24.196
Come with me
 on the journey to Shel--

24:24.263 --> 24:27.967
and to Shel and to Shel
 and to Shel and back.

24:28.034 --> 24:31.638
Come with me on the journey
 to Shel and back.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.590
When I was a young girl,

24:50.657 --> 24:51.858
something happened to me

24:51.924 --> 24:55.327
that made me stop being
who I really was.

24:55.394 --> 24:59.532
I stopped growing
 in every sense of the word.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.936
I have always
been drawn to men

25:04.003 --> 25:06.973
who wanted to live
 in the darkness of a secret.

25:08.474 --> 25:11.878
Who am I? I didn't know.

25:11.944 --> 25:14.781
I didn't know,
 and I didn't want to know.

25:14.847 --> 25:19.251
I was in a cocoon.

25:24.924 --> 25:29.195
* I'm broke, but I'm happy

25:30.563 --> 25:34.667
* I'm poor, but I'm kind

25:36.435 --> 25:40.339
* I'm short, but I'm healthy

25:40.406 --> 25:42.609
* Yeah

25:44.310 --> 25:49.115
* I'm high,
 but I'm grounded *

25:49.181 --> 25:55.554
* I'm sane,
 but I'm overwhelmed *

25:55.622 --> 25:58.791
* I'm lost

25:58.858 --> 26:01.527
* But I'm hopeful

26:01.594 --> 26:05.164
* Baby

26:05.231 --> 26:08.801
* What it all comes
 down to *

26:10.603 --> 26:11.971
* Is that everything's
 going to be *

26:12.038 --> 26:16.542
* Fine, fine, fine

26:16.609 --> 26:19.946
* 'Cause I got
one hand in my pocket *

26:20.012 --> 26:26.686
* And the other one
is giving a high five *

26:27.687 --> 26:30.189
* I feel drunk,
but I'm sober *

26:30.256 --> 26:32.591
* I'm young,
 and I'm underpaid *

26:32.659 --> 26:35.027
* I'm tired, but I'm workin'

26:35.094 --> 26:37.096
* Yeah

26:37.163 --> 26:39.766
* I care, but I'm restless

26:39.832 --> 26:42.802
* I'm here,
 but I'm really gone *

26:42.869 --> 26:44.336
* I'm wrong

26:46.806 --> 26:48.374
* I'm sorry

26:50.209 --> 26:53.079
* Baby

26:53.145 --> 26:57.917
* What it all comes down to

26:57.984 --> 27:01.754
* Is that everything's
 going to be quite all right *

27:03.322 --> 27:06.625
* 'Cause I got one hand
in my pocket *

27:06.693 --> 27:10.229
* And the other one
is giving a peace sign *

27:11.964 --> 27:13.499
Whoo!

27:13.565 --> 27:16.502
* I'm free, but I'm focused

27:16.568 --> 27:18.671
* I'm green, but I'm wise

27:18.738 --> 27:24.010
* I'm hard,
but I'm friendly, baby *

27:24.076 --> 27:26.345
* I'm sad, but I'm laughing

27:26.412 --> 27:29.081
* I'm brave,
 but I'm chickenshit *

27:29.148 --> 27:32.885
* I'm sick, but I'm pretty

27:32.952 --> 27:38.290
* Baby, what it all
 boils down to *

27:42.261 --> 27:44.731
Is that no one's got it
 all figured out just yet.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.901
* 'Cause I got one hand
in my pocket *

27:48.968 --> 27:52.739
* And the other one
 is playing the piano *

27:52.805 --> 27:55.207
Give it up for Trevor,
 everybody!

27:57.710 --> 28:00.847
* What it all boils down to

28:00.913 --> 28:05.584
* My friends

28:05.651 --> 28:08.821
* Is that everything's just

28:08.888 --> 28:12.424
* Fine, fine, fine

28:14.994 --> 28:21.700
* 'Cause I got one hand
in my pocket *

28:25.171 --> 28:31.277
* And the other one
 is hailin' a taxicab *

28:31.343 --> 28:37.416
- * Yeah

28:53.032 --> 28:58.237
* And what it all comes
 down to, my friends, is *

28:58.304 --> 29:03.943
* Is that everything is
 just fine, fine, fine *

29:04.010 --> 29:06.979
* 'Cause I've got
 one hand in my pocket *

29:07.046 --> 29:10.883
* And the other one
 is givin' a high five *

29:14.887 --> 29:17.489
* I feel drunk,
 but I'm sober *

29:17.556 --> 29:20.259
* I'm young,
 and I'm underpaid *

29:20.326 --> 29:22.761
.. * I'm tired,
 but I'm workin' *

29:22.829 --> 29:23.963
* Yeah

29:25.631 --> 29:28.000
* I care, but I'm restless

29:28.067 --> 29:30.502
* I'm here,
 but I'm really gone *

29:30.569 --> 29:34.907
* I'm wrong,
 and I'm sorry, baby *

29:34.974 --> 29:38.477
* And what it all comes
 down to, my friends *

29:38.544 --> 29:44.851
* Yeah, is that everything
 is just fine, fine, fine *

29:45.617 --> 29:46.986
* 'Cause I've got...
