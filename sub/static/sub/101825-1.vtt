02:06.183 --> 02:07.516
Good morning. Geppetto.

02:08.265 --> 02:10.514
- Good morning. - Good morning.

02:11.889 --> 02:15.430
- Good morning.
- Can I get you something?

02:16.304 --> 02:17.887
- To me? - Yup.

02:17.970 --> 02:21.761
No. no. I wanted... I wanted a...

02:22.010 --> 02:26.217
No. I just wanted to warm up a little.
It's cold outside! Have you heard?

02:26.384 --> 02:27.758
Of course?

02:28.675 --> 02:32.923
I put myself here...
a moment to warm up. huh.

02:33.006 --> 02:35.964
- Go. sit down. - Thank you. Oh!

02:38.130 --> 02:41.628
Sorry. but I was about to break a foot.
Look here.

02:42.170 --> 02:46.168
- It can break at any moment.
- It's like that. it won't break.

02:46.252 --> 02:49.709
I do this job in half an hour.
It is cheap.

02:49.792 --> 02:51.833
It's solid. it's fine.

02:52.707 --> 02:55.207
Okay. as you want.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.871
- But here... - Hey!

03:01.954 --> 03:07.244
Sorry. but... this table hangs all
the way to the right. have you seen?

03:07.369 --> 03:09.076
- The table?
- You don't eat here.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.159
- No. - This is more serious.

03:11.617 --> 03:16.532
It takes a few days.
I'll take it tomorrow and fix it.

03:16.615 --> 03:19.031
- No. he's fine. don't worry.
- All right.

03:22.446 --> 03:25.154
Then I go. goodbye.

03:30.110 --> 03:33.901
This door gets out of hand.
It is to be thrown away.

03:34.026 --> 03:37.982
To enter it does not open.
to exit it does not close. Look.

03:38.066 --> 03:42.481
- I'll make it like new. - You don't
have to do anything again. Sit down.

03:42.564 --> 03:43.814
- It's free. - Come.

03:43.897 --> 03:45.771
- I'll fix it. - No.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.312
Eat. I'll offer this to you

03:48.479 --> 03:51.936
if not slowly you will
dismantle the whole inn.

03:52.269 --> 03:53.976
Okay. Moreno.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.850
- Anyway. the door needs to be changed.
- I know.

03:58.308 --> 04:00.641
I'll give you this piece
of bread with cheese too.

04:00.724 --> 04:01.682
Thank you.

04:01.766 --> 04:04.682
But you don't have to say anything anymore. okay?

04:15.307 --> 04:20.557
It should not be done immediately. it holds
up a few days. In fact. the table is fine.

04:20.641 --> 04:24.057
- He fixed himself.
- The chair is also doing well.

04:29.974 --> 04:33.390
The fun has come!

04:33.474 --> 04:36.349
Cheerfulness has arrived!

Excuse me. but...
Excuse me. but puppets like?

04:52.724 --> 04:55.390
- puppets puppets.
- But made with wood?

04:55.474 --> 04:58.057
- Sure. - Oh yes?

04:58.432 --> 05:02.432
- Can I see a moment?
- No. Hurry!

05:32.432 --> 05:34.182
Enough. you can't watch!

05:34.265 --> 05:36.390
It is not seen so well.

05:37.182 --> 05:38.932
- Okay thanks.

05:39.015 --> 05:41.015
- Yes. - Hurry!

06:38.973 --> 06:41.056
Ah!

06:44.056 --> 06:46.140
Oh!

06:48.056 --> 06:53.098
Ah!  Ah!  Ah!

06:55.681 --> 06:58.056
Master Cherry?

06:59.848 --> 07:01.931
Master Cherry!

07:05.223 --> 07:06.473
Cherry!

07:09.014 --> 07:12.223
- Cherry. what are you doing on the ground?
- Nothing.

07:13.056 --> 07:15.473
- Cherry. it's me. - Eh.

07:15.556 --> 07:16.639
Eh...

07:16.973 --> 07:20.348
- How's it going. all right?
- Yes. Say. say.

07:20.889 --> 07:24.764
No. I came...
to ask you a favor.

07:24.848 --> 07:25.806
Ah.

07:25.889 --> 07:29.514
I had an idea this morning.
in my opinion beautiful.

07:29.598 --> 07:32.223
- Can you hear me? I tell you?
- Yup.

07:32.306 --> 07:35.681
I had thought of making
with my own hands

07:35.764 --> 07:37.473
a wooden puppet.

07:37.681 --> 07:42.389
But not just any puppet. it must
be the most beautiful in the world.

07:42.473 --> 07:44.723
People have to say.
"But who did it?"

07:44.806 --> 07:47.306
And be amazed.

07:47.973 --> 07:51.056
And then with this puppet
I want to travel the world

07:51.139 --> 07:54.181
and earn a living honestly.

07:54.848 --> 07:56.389
I also found his name.

07:56.889 --> 08:01.097
- I thought of "Pinocchio". Nice. huh?
- Yup.

08:01.222 --> 08:02.764
- Cherry? - Eh?

08:02.847 --> 08:05.181
Tell me the truth. did you drink?

08:05.264 --> 08:09.014
- No. I didn't drink.
- You drank.

08:09.097 --> 08:12.639
- No. - I know. you can tell me.

08:13.306 --> 08:17.139
Geppetto. what do you want from me?

08:17.556 --> 08:18.847
I wanted a little pleasure.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.472
- You know I love you. - Of you.

08:21.556 --> 08:23.764
- I've always loved you. - Yup.

08:23.847 --> 08:27.722
Master Cherry. I would need.
if it doesn't bother you.

08:27.806 --> 08:31.681
of a piece of wood.
because I currently have nothing.

08:31.972 --> 08:36.139
- Do you have a piece of wood?
- Yes. yes.

08:36.389 --> 08:37.806
I have it. I have it!

08:41.264 --> 08:42.972
Take that over there.

08:43.639 --> 08:47.222
What are you saying? Are you really drunk?
This is too much!

08:48.097 --> 08:49.764
Take it!

08:49.847 --> 08:52.014
I can't accept it.
I'm fine with a scrap.

08:52.097 --> 08:55.722
I'll give it to you! No!
This no. I need it.

08:56.097 --> 09:00.180
- I'll give it to you.
- But Cherry. this... Show me.

09:00.389 --> 09:03.722
Oh. mom. this is one of the
most beautiful pieces of wood

09:03.972 --> 09:06.222
I've ever seen in my life.

09:06.430 --> 09:09.472
Here we come...
a wonderful puppet.

10:24.305 --> 10:27.430
Here. now I'm almost done.

10:32.597 --> 10:34.722
Can you hear me. Pinocchio?

10:35.138 --> 10:36.513
Can you hear me?

10:45.596 --> 10:47.055
Come on. Pinocchio.

10:48.055 --> 10:49.180
Pinocchio!

10:49.305 --> 10:52.096
Come on. say something.
Move your mouth for your dad.

10:52.180 --> 10:54.846
Here. say "dad".

10:55.930 --> 10:58.596
Dad.  Look look.

10:59.721 --> 11:03.055
Dad.

11:03.138 --> 11:04.180
Come on!

11:07.013 --> 11:08.305
Pinocchio!

11:09.471 --> 11:10.513
Dad.

11:20.555 --> 11:21.930
Dad!

11:30.055 --> 11:33.763
I was born a son!
I was born a son!

11:33.846 --> 11:36.096
I have a son!  Can you hear me?

11:36.554 --> 11:40.679
I became a dad! I became a dad!

11:40.763 --> 11:42.929
- What happened? - Remigio!

11:43.013 --> 11:44.804
- But do you know what happened?
- That?

11:44.888 --> 11:47.096
- I had a son. - Really?

11:47.179 --> 11:48.721
- He was born now.
- Best wishes!

11:48.804 --> 11:51.221
- Thank you. I became a dad.
- Geppetto!

11:51.304 --> 11:52.929
- Barbara! - What's up?

11:53.804 --> 11:57.221
I wanted to tell you.
I was born a son. I became a father.

11:57.304 --> 12:01.846
- So. overnight?
- No. any minute.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.929
- You are making fun of me?
- No!

12:04.221 --> 12:08.929
I am happy for you. but now go to bed.
You woke up the neighborhood.

12:09.013 --> 12:13.221
It wasn't my intention. but I wanted
to say that a son was born to me!

12:31.471 --> 12:34.179
I almost did. huh.  Here we are.

12:34.512 --> 12:35.554
Here we are.

12:40.679 --> 12:42.429
Look.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.929
This is you. Pinocchio.
Do you like yourself?

13:01.262 --> 13:04.804
Do you like yourself?
Do you like how I made you?

13:04.971 --> 13:06.012
To me a lot.

13:10.637 --> 13:15.221
Pinocchio. be careful.
Now Father teaches you to walk.

13:15.346 --> 13:19.262
You have to walk well. otherwise
you fall and you can hurt yourself.

13:19.345 --> 13:21.512
You have to pay attention.  Look.

13:21.595 --> 13:26.595
I'll teach you. first one leg
and then the other. One and two.

13:26.679 --> 13:31.054
Look at me. huh?  One and two.

13:31.137 --> 13:36.804
One and two. one and two.

13:36.970 --> 13:40.387
If you do like me. in two or three
days you can already walk by...

13:40.679 --> 13:44.304
Pinocchio! Pinocchio!
But have you already learned?

13:47.929 --> 13:51.220
Pinocchio!  Pinocchio!

13:52.887 --> 13:56.679
Pinocchio!
I haven't even finished making you

13:56.762 --> 13:58.554
and I already lack respect?

13:58.637 --> 14:01.637
It starts badly. badly!

14:01.720 --> 14:02.762
Dad. I'm going!

14:08.845 --> 14:13.387
Listen to dad. go back...

14:18.678 --> 14:21.303
Help!

14:23.012 --> 14:25.095
Help!

14:33.512 --> 14:35.303
Pinocchio!

14:39.928 --> 14:41.262
Pinocchio!

14:43.053 --> 14:44.803
Pinocchio!

14:53.845 --> 14:55.345
Pinocchio!

15:01.845 --> 15:03.136
Pinocchio!

15:04.428 --> 15:05.803
Who is it?

15:08.595 --> 15:11.636
It's me. I'm the Talking Cricket

15:11.970 --> 15:15.053
and I've lived in this
room for over 100 years.

15:15.220 --> 15:18.053
I saw how you behaved
with your father

15:18.303 --> 15:20.470
and I want to tell you a great truth.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.095
Woe to boys who
disobey their parents.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.970
They will never have
good in this world.

15:27.428 --> 15:29.803
- I don't want to obey. - Eh?

15:30.011 --> 15:34.470
- And when will you go to school? - In
fact I don't feel like going to school.

15:34.553 --> 15:38.428
Poor Pinocchio.
you really pity me.

15:39.095 --> 15:42.178
- And why?
- Because you're a puppet.

15:42.511 --> 15:45.678
And what's worse.
you have a wooden head.

15:45.761 --> 15:49.636
- Now you got bored.
- Why did I call you "dumbbell"?

15:49.720 --> 15:53.636
- It makes me nervous!
- You see? You're a dumbbell!

15:53.761 --> 15:56.469
- Enough. shut up! - Dumbbell!

15:56.553 --> 15:58.344
You got tired of me!

15:59.969 --> 16:01.219
Ouch!

16:34.469 --> 16:37.136
- Who is it?
- Pinocchio! Are you at home?

16:37.219 --> 16:40.386
I've been looking for you all day!
I am your dad!

16:40.469 --> 16:42.886
- Open me! - Santa. I'm coming!

16:43.844 --> 16:44.969
Oh!

16:46.469 --> 16:50.427
- Dad! - Pinocchio. open!

16:50.511 --> 16:52.261
I can't. I no longer have legs!

16:52.344 --> 16:55.011
What does it mean?  You open!

16:55.094 --> 16:57.886
- I no longer have legs!
- Wait up!

16:58.219 --> 17:00.427
Fast. dad. fast!

17:00.552 --> 17:01.594
Ah!

17:03.427 --> 17:06.886
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio. here is Father.

17:06.969 --> 17:09.801
Dad is coming. don't worry.

17:09.886 --> 17:10.969
Ah!

17:13.926 --> 17:18.219
But look over there! How did you
manage to burn your feet like this?

17:20.551 --> 17:23.636
I fell asleep with
my feet on the fire.

17:24.051 --> 17:27.676
Did you fall asleep with your
feet on the fire? Pinocchio!

17:27.801 --> 17:29.677
But you have to be careful!

17:29.844 --> 17:34.052
If I didn't come. what were you
doing. did you burn everything?

17:34.136 --> 17:38.927
Look at them. I made you two feet.
Pinocchio. beautiful. but beautiful

17:39.011 --> 17:42.385
so beautiful. that they liked me so much.
And now how do you do it?

17:42.594 --> 17:44.094
Can you do it again?

17:49.177 --> 17:53.052
No! If I do it again.
you will run away again. So you learn!

17:53.135 --> 17:55.552
- Please! - I said no.

17:55.635 --> 17:59.260
As soon as I made you and learned to
walk. you ran away.

17:59.344 --> 18:01.677
I've looked for you everywhere.
I won't do it again.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.344
Please. dad. dad.

18:04.427 --> 18:08.510
- No. - Come on.
will you do it again? Please. dad.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.594
Pinocchio. now sleep.
Be good with your legs.

18:17.677 --> 18:20.052
Stop.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.344
Stop!  Down.

18:22.427 --> 18:24.260
Look how beautiful they are. huh?

18:25.219 --> 18:28.594
- Down. enough!
- But they're new. dad.

18:28.677 --> 18:33.010
I understand. but you will use them tomorrow.
Come on. you have to wake up early.

18:33.093 --> 18:36.927
Now go to sleep.
we have to go to school tomorrow morning.

18:38.468 --> 18:40.385
Together with the other children

18:40.468 --> 18:43.718
you will learn to read
and write with the ABC.

18:44.093 --> 18:45.635
What is an ABC book?

18:45.718 --> 18:51.385
What is the ABC. Pinocchio?
It is a book where there are letters.

18:51.760 --> 18:54.843
Did you understand?
To go to school you have to buy it.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.760
You have to buy it.

19:01.760 --> 19:05.468
- Cecconi. good morning.
- Oh. Geppetto. Good morning.

19:05.552 --> 19:08.052
I need a ABC book.

19:08.135 --> 19:10.052
- Ah. gladly. - Thank you.

19:11.010 --> 19:16.635
Here it is. Here it is now...
I can't pay now...

19:16.718 --> 19:20.510
However... I have many jobs
that must come back to me.

19:20.593 --> 19:26.301
- First I'll pay you. - Yes.
but if they don't pay you. what happens?

19:26.385 --> 19:28.760
- They pay me for sure. - No.

19:30.593 --> 19:32.385
- I need the ABC book. - I know.

19:32.468 --> 19:35.551
- I'm sorry.
- I need it right away.

19:38.176 --> 19:43.010
Okay. look. then...
Okay if I give you my jacket?

19:43.301 --> 19:47.010
Look what I'm forced to do.
Look at that piece.

19:47.093 --> 19:51.385
- I'll give it to you as an advance.
- But this is more than 100 years old.

19:51.468 --> 19:54.885
- Is old. Who do I sell it to?
- What did you say?

19:54.968 --> 20:00.176
- She's 100 years old. she's old.
- This isn't 100. it's 200.

20:00.260 --> 20:03.426
It is not old. it is ancient.
It is a collector's piece.

20:03.510 --> 20:07.135
Do you know whose it was? Of the
grandfather of the marquise's grandfather.

20:07.843 --> 20:10.926
Think about you!  Thank you.

20:11.010 --> 20:16.135
But was the jacket also from the
grandfather of the marquise's grandfather?

20:16.218 --> 20:17.635
- The jacket? - Yup.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.176
- You want? - To do the pairing.

20:20.259 --> 20:23.634
- Jacket. jacket...
- In this cold? All right.

20:23.718 --> 20:25.343
I need the ABC book.

20:25.593 --> 20:29.218
However. the jacket also belonged
to the marquise's grandfather.

20:32.426 --> 20:34.926
And... the pants?

20:35.009 --> 20:40.009
No! No. these were from my grandfather. they
were not from the marquise's grandfather.

20:42.926 --> 20:44.176
- Anna. Albertina! - Hello.

20:44.259 --> 20:45.968
I took my son to school.

20:46.093 --> 20:50.009
Come on. it's getting late.
Come on. Pinocchio.

20:50.634 --> 20:54.843
Master Cherry!
Just you I was looking for.

20:54.926 --> 20:56.884
It's the piece of
wood you gave me.

20:56.968 --> 20:58.093
Good morning.

20:58.301 --> 21:02.301
Bravo. Pinocchio. Didn't I make a
masterpiece? It's called Pinocchio.

21:02.801 --> 21:04.301
He is my son.

21:04.884 --> 21:05.968
Cherry.

21:06.926 --> 21:07.968
Cherry?

21:09.676 --> 21:13.301
- He is my son. Cherry? - Eh?

21:14.176 --> 21:17.509
You drank. huh?  Oh well.

21:17.717 --> 21:20.967
Goodbye. Cherry.
You have to drink less. Here we go.

21:21.051 --> 21:24.842
The fun has arrived.
the joy has arrived!

21:25.509 --> 21:26.759
What's up?

21:29.467 --> 21:30.551
What is that?

21:31.176 --> 21:34.342
It is the Puppet Theater.
There are your brothers

21:34.509 --> 21:39.467
puppets like you. Indeed. no. because
you are the most beautiful of all. Power.

21:39.551 --> 21:43.842
- What are they doing?
- They make... puppets.

21:43.926 --> 21:47.467
They have fun. they make people laugh.
We go to school.

21:47.551 --> 21:50.842
First study and then.
maybe. we go there.

21:50.926 --> 21:53.051
Come on. let's go to school now.

21:56.259 --> 22:00.301
- Here. Hi. Pinocchio.
- Hello Dad.

22:02.884 --> 22:06.800
You must be the best of all.
Do you promise me?

22:07.342 --> 22:08.425
Hi.

22:18.509 --> 22:20.467
Hi. my son.  Hi.

22:26.384 --> 22:28.384
I took my son to school.

22:46.134 --> 22:47.884
Hey. hey!

22:50.550 --> 22:53.925
But are you a puppet?
Where are the threads?

22:54.634 --> 22:57.175
- You are welcome.
- I don't have threads.

22:57.633 --> 22:59.133
Looking for a job?

22:59.217 --> 23:03.258
- No. I came here to watch.
- You need four bucks. Do you have them?

23:03.675 --> 23:04.592
No.

23:04.675 --> 23:08.550
So go. Hurry up.
there are only a few minutes left!

23:08.633 --> 23:12.425
Hurry up. hurry up.
there are the last places!

23:12.508 --> 23:15.300
You can not enter.
It's the last show!

23:15.383 --> 23:17.800
- Would you have any money?
- No dear.

23:18.175 --> 23:19.508
We are almost full!

23:21.592 --> 23:26.217
- Sorry!
- Do you have any money to give me?

23:27.758 --> 23:30.967
Four money?  What are you giving me?

23:31.050 --> 23:34.842
The Grand Puppet Theater!
Please Please!

23:35.842 --> 23:39.217
Run. it's the last show!

23:39.300 --> 23:43.550
- My dad's ABC book.
- Let me see it. right?

23:49.342 --> 23:54.341
How tired I am!
Today I really don't want to do anything.

23:54.425 --> 23:58.425
Idea: I'll pretend I'm
deaf. so I won't work.

23:59.800 --> 24:04.216
- Harlequin. take my medicine!
- Should I go to the kitchen?

24:04.300 --> 24:08.883
Which kitchen? The medicine!
Run to pick it up at the pharmacy!

24:08.966 --> 24:11.550
But which Lucia?
I don't know any Lucia.

24:11.633 --> 24:13.341
- Who is this Lucia?
- Do you know her?

24:13.425 --> 24:15.300
No!

24:15.383 --> 24:19.425
- Have you gone mad?
- The cat! The cat ran away!

24:19.591 --> 24:21.925
- Have you seen it? - No!

24:22.008 --> 24:23.550
- Cat! - But which cat?

24:23.633 --> 24:25.508
- My cat. - Crazy! Crazy!

24:25.591 --> 24:27.675
And what the hell!

24:29.383 --> 24:33.008
- Oh! - The devil!

24:33.633 --> 24:36.466
- Who called me?
- He called you!

24:36.550 --> 24:41.300
I? Then. ugly wretch. hear us!

24:41.841 --> 24:44.758
Trousers. tell me the truth.
Who did it?

24:45.049 --> 24:47.508
- Harlequin.
- The mouth of truth.

24:47.591 --> 24:49.674
- Who called him? - He!

24:49.758 --> 24:53.591
Pant!  It was Pantalone!

24:53.674 --> 24:57.133
- Make up your mind!
- He's the joker.

24:57.216 --> 25:00.758
Dream or am I awake?
Numbers of the firmament...

25:01.841 --> 25:03.424
That's a wooden puppet over there!

25:03.508 --> 25:05.841
- Yup! - It's like us!

25:07.549 --> 25:11.341
- It's true! What's your name?
- Pinocchio.

25:11.424 --> 25:15.091
Pinocchio. come into the
arms of your wooden brothers.

25:15.216 --> 25:16.299
Come on. Pinocchio!

25:19.216 --> 25:21.341
Come.  Come.

25:21.424 --> 25:23.966
- Pinocchio. - Oh!

25:25.091 --> 25:28.508
- Pinocchio. you are our brother.
- You're our brother.

25:28.716 --> 25:32.674
Run away. Pinocchio!  You must run away!

25:33.633 --> 25:36.466
- Away! - What's going on here?

25:36.549 --> 25:39.591
Run away. go away! Why?

25:40.382 --> 25:41.674
Escape!

25:43.549 --> 25:46.716
Come here!  Ehi you!

25:47.216 --> 25:50.341
- Who are you? - I'm Pinocchio.

25:56.132 --> 25:59.216
What about the wires?  Wireless?

25:59.299 --> 26:02.549
You come with me. away!
Start the show again.

26:09.174 --> 26:11.007
Come with me. go!  Come!

See you tomorrow!

26:24.507 --> 26:27.216
- Sorry? Sorry! - Yup?

26:27.299 --> 26:29.965
Wait. a baby is missing.

26:30.632 --> 26:33.132
I have already looked. there are no more.

26:33.215 --> 26:36.924
No. my son is missing.
I brought it this morning.

26:37.090 --> 26:39.799
If I say no...
How is this child?

26:39.882 --> 26:43.965
He is a child...
handsome. with a hat and a red dress.

26:44.049 --> 26:49.924
It has a new ABC. It's called Pinocchio.
Then. oh well. it's made of wood.

26:51.215 --> 26:56.215
Wooden? Forgive me.
only the chairs are left here.

26:56.299 --> 27:00.549
There must be my son.
I brought it this morning. Controls!

27:00.632 --> 27:04.632
Since he told me how it is.
look at the Puppet Theater.

27:04.715 --> 27:08.090
I'm busy. now I'm not telling you anymore.
Be patient.

27:08.257 --> 27:09.299
At the Puppet Theater?

27:35.132 --> 27:38.548
- Cecconi? Cecconi!
- Yes I'm here.

27:38.632 --> 27:43.632
- Wasn't there the Puppet Theater?
- Yes. there was. but they went away.

27:43.715 --> 27:47.465
- Where did they go?
- I don't know where they went.

27:47.548 --> 27:48.965
- Didn't you see it? - No.

27:49.048 --> 27:52.257
Did you see if there was a red puppet?
He is my son.

27:52.340 --> 27:56.840
Wax. He went to the show and then...
I don't know.

27:58.007 --> 27:59.632
You do not know.

28:03.882 --> 28:07.507
They took it from me.  They stole it from me.

28:08.423 --> 28:12.423
It was too good.
It was too well done. I knew it.

28:12.757 --> 28:15.215
They took me Pinocchio.
they took my son.

28:15.506 --> 28:16.840
But I find it!

28:19.131 --> 28:22.506
I have to find him.
even if I have to go beyond the sea.

28:23.173 --> 28:24.215
I find it.

28:37.423 --> 28:39.465
Here everything goes out.

28:40.548 --> 28:43.715
The fire must be revived!  Gendarmes!

28:44.006 --> 28:46.965
Bring me the new puppet.
it will make a good blaze.

28:47.048 --> 28:48.673
Leave me!

28:48.756 --> 28:51.256
I don't want to die. save me!

28:51.340 --> 28:56.006
I beg you! I don't wanna die!
Save me!

28:56.423 --> 29:01.840
He sneezed! Keep touching his
heart and your life will be saved.

29:02.131 --> 29:06.506
I don't want to die and
leave my poor father alone!

29:06.756 --> 29:10.173
- He has no one else!
- The mutton is half raw!

29:10.256 --> 29:11.839
He does everything for me!

29:11.923 --> 29:13.881
- I'm hungry! - Please. no!

29:13.964 --> 29:17.173
- Put it on the fire. go!
- My dad has only me!

29:17.256 --> 29:20.256
Don't let me die like
that. please!

29:20.339 --> 29:21.798
Leave him.

29:24.548 --> 29:27.548
Of course. your poor father...

29:28.089 --> 29:32.006
Wouldn't like it if you jumped
into the hot coals. right?

29:32.506 --> 29:35.006
Poor old man.  I...

29:41.548 --> 29:47.298
If I can't throw you out. though...
You have to pity me too. I'm hungry.

29:47.798 --> 29:50.589
I don't like half-raw mutton!

29:51.048 --> 29:55.923
If I don't throw you away. I have to throw
someone else. Bring me Harlequin. come on!

29:56.006 --> 29:59.756
- Bring it to the fire!
- Like Harlequin?

29:59.839 --> 30:01.464
Harlequin. yes.  Come on!

30:01.547 --> 30:03.881
- No! I don't wanna die!
- Because he?

30:03.964 --> 30:05.714
I don't want to be burnt!

30:05.797 --> 30:08.131
- Not him!
- Either you or him. Come on!

30:08.214 --> 30:12.172
Leave him!
Throw me into the fire. rather!

30:12.256 --> 30:13.589
I don't wanna die!

30:13.672 --> 30:15.756
- Leave him! - Stop.

30:20.464 --> 30:22.714
You are a good puppet.

30:23.797 --> 30:27.714
Good boy.  Come here. give me a kiss.

30:51.172 --> 30:55.005
Then it means that I
will be satisfied...

30:56.130 --> 30:59.047
to eat a half-raw mutton.

31:00.547 --> 31:03.047
Thanks to Pinocchio

32:04.297 --> 32:08.047
- The poor. - Do you earn a lot?

32:09.505 --> 32:12.463
He earns so much that he doesn't
even have a penny in his pocket.

32:12.547 --> 32:13.588
Ah.

32:15.380 --> 32:17.505
And this dress like you did it?

32:18.422 --> 32:21.047
- With its blankets. - Really?

32:22.630 --> 32:24.338
He is poor. he is poor.

32:24.422 --> 32:27.005
So... hold on.

Take these five gold coins.

- If the three of us go...
- Yes.

36:16.128 --> 36:18.628
Let's take the coin. the sequin.

36:18.712 --> 36:22.753
We make a hole. we sow
it. we bury it well.

36:23.253 --> 36:26.628
Then what does it take?
A little water. abundant.

36:26.712 --> 36:28.545
Water. water. water.

36:28.670 --> 36:34.170
Let's wait a few hours.
What happens? The seed sprouts.

36:34.253 --> 36:39.628
- Sprouts. sprouts. sprouts.
- Sprouts. sprouts. sprouts.

36:39.712 --> 36:44.587
- A plant full of sequins is born.
- A plant full of sequins.

36:44.670 --> 36:48.920
From a sequin.
a plant with 500 sequins.

36:49.003 --> 36:50.670
- Are you interested?
- Are you interested?

36:50.753 --> 36:51.795
Beautiful!

36:51.878 --> 36:54.587
Oh yeah.  Do we want to go there?

36:54.670 --> 36:56.128
- Yup? - Yup.

36:56.212 --> 36:59.045
Come on. come with us.
And then we do one thing.

36:59.337 --> 37:02.878
Since we have to wait for
sunrise. we stop at the tavern.

37:02.962 --> 37:05.295
- Spizzicina a little.
- A little something.

37:05.378 --> 37:07.961
- So let's make friends.
- Let's get friend.

37:08.086 --> 37:14.253
We eat a little something and wait.
and at dawn we sow the sequins.

37:14.336 --> 37:18.128
- The seedling blooms in the morning.
- But I'm not hungry.

37:18.503 --> 37:21.711
- Okay. let's have a little something.
- A little something.

37:21.795 --> 37:25.878
And at dawn the seedling...
500 sequins. one sequin.

37:26.128 --> 37:29.920
Two sequins. 1.000.
Many plants full of sequins.

37:30.003 --> 37:34.545
If I replant 1.200 sequins.
do they come out more and more?

37:34.628 --> 37:35.670
Yup.

37:51.420 --> 37:56.128
- You said "spizzichino".
- A very good spizzichino.

37:58.878 --> 38:01.669
- But... - Good.

38:01.753 --> 38:03.836
- But if... - Ah!

38:04.878 --> 38:06.461
Here is the marrow.

38:09.544 --> 38:13.003
But if I plant five gold sequins

38:14.294 --> 38:16.753
how many come out of it?

38:16.836 --> 38:22.128
- So. first of all... speak slowly.
- Plan.

38:22.211 --> 38:23.919
- They hear us. - They hear us.

38:24.003 --> 38:27.294
If you plant a sequin. 500.

38:27.378 --> 38:30.086
- Five sequins. 2.500. - 2.500.

38:30.294 --> 38:34.211
Spizzichiamo.  Let us tickle.

38:35.503 --> 38:41.086
So many? 2.500?
Can I 500 to you?

38:41.211 --> 38:45.294
No! Then we didn't understand each other!
We did not understand each other!

38:45.586 --> 38:49.044
- If you do that. you offend us.
- You offend us.

38:50.419 --> 38:55.086
This feather...
We don't do it out of interest.

38:55.169 --> 38:58.419
- For interest.
- No. we do it out of friendship.

38:58.544 --> 39:00.252
Because you are our friend.

39:00.336 --> 39:01.461
We are friends?

39:01.544 --> 39:04.252
- Yes and then!

39:08.169 --> 39:11.336
Why can't we go now?

39:11.419 --> 39:13.627
- Pinch. - Pinch.

39:13.711 --> 39:16.252
- Let's take a nap. - Rest.

39:16.336 --> 39:17.961
And at dawn we are on the spot.

39:27.169 --> 39:31.377
Pinocchio!  Come come.

39:31.627 --> 39:33.794
- Look. - Look.

39:38.002 --> 39:41.086
Do you like? Did you see
the seedling as it bloomed?

39:41.169 --> 39:42.794
Fiorita...

39:43.877 --> 39:45.127
Nice. huh?

39:45.877 --> 39:48.960
Did you see?  And you didn't believe it.

39:49.377 --> 39:51.127
- Get the coins. - Coins.

39:51.210 --> 39:52.585
They are all yours.

39:52.835 --> 39:54.169
- Go. run. - Coins!

39:54.252 --> 39:56.127
- Take them! - Coins!

40:03.669 --> 40:06.544
Jump higher.  Hop!

40:08.085 --> 40:12.669
It doesn't get there.
He is small. our friend.

40:14.294 --> 40:19.794
We will help you. we are here on purpose.
We are your friends.

40:20.419 --> 40:22.085
Take this.

40:22.544 --> 40:25.794
This. this. this...
and this. this...

40:25.960 --> 40:28.252
- That! This! - Which?

40:28.377 --> 40:31.710
How many coins!
How many coins for your dad.

40:31.794 --> 40:37.210
How many coins for your dad

40:37.293 --> 40:41.752
- How many coins for your dad
- Here! No. there!

40:41.835 --> 40:45.918
- Leave. - Dad dad

40:46.002 --> 40:51.252
How many coins for your dad

40:53.543 --> 40:56.918
Wake up. it's midnight!

40:57.793 --> 41:00.418
- Who is it?
- I'm the innkeeper.

41:02.585 --> 41:06.335
Are my companions ready?
- They're already gone.

41:06.502 --> 41:10.710
They told me to tell you they are
waiting for you at the end of the woods.

41:11.002 --> 41:15.043
- There is also a bill to pay.
- Didn't they pay them?

41:15.460 --> 41:18.543
No. because they were
afraid of offending you.

41:18.668 --> 41:20.752
- Offend me? - Yup.

41:21.377 --> 41:25.418
Let's go up.  I'll wait for you down.

41:39.376 --> 41:43.335
Pinocchio!  Pinocchio!

41:44.043 --> 41:45.293
Who is it?

41:45.376 --> 41:49.001
Pinocchio. it's me.
and I want to give you some advice.

41:49.085 --> 41:50.751
Come back.

41:51.126 --> 41:55.835
Bring the four sequins
left to your poor father

41:56.251 --> 42:00.585
who cries and despairs for
never seeing you again.

42:00.751 --> 42:06.085
I can't go back.
Tomorrow my dad will have 2.000 sequins.

42:06.168 --> 42:09.210
Listen to me. Pinocchio. don't trust me

42:09.293 --> 42:13.376
of those who promise to make
you rich from morning to night.

42:13.460 --> 42:17.626
Those are either
crazy or cheaters.

42:17.960 --> 42:22.418
- Listen to me. go back.
- I go forward.

42:22.543 --> 42:27.126
Remember that the guys who
want to do their own thing

42:27.376 --> 42:31.001
- sooner or later they regret it.
- All right. Goodnight. Grillo.

42:31.126 --> 42:35.209
- Now shut up. though.
- Goodnight. Pinocchio.

42:35.709 --> 42:39.918
- Heaven save you from murderers.
- Shut up!

42:48.668 --> 42:51.126
Murderers don't exist.

43:06.543 --> 43:08.626
Oh!

43:09.334 --> 43:11.334
- We are the killers!
- Assassins!

43:11.418 --> 43:13.043
Give us the sequins!

43:13.168 --> 43:14.626
I have to give them to my dad!

43:14.709 --> 43:17.126
- Give us the sequins!
- Sequins!

43:18.917 --> 43:19.917
The sequins!

43:20.001 --> 43:22.709
- No. I can not! - Take it!

43:43.042 --> 43:46.542
Please open up! Please open up!

43:46.626 --> 43:49.334
I'm chased!
Please. I don't know what to do!

43:57.376 --> 44:01.459
There is nobody in this house.
They are all dead.

44:01.542 --> 44:04.834
But like nobody? I see you!
Please open up!

44:05.042 --> 44:08.000
- I'm dead too. - But how dead?

44:08.167 --> 44:10.875
Wait. please!  Do not leave me!

44:10.959 --> 44:12.792
- Take it! - Please!

44:12.875 --> 44:14.792
Give us the sequins!  Come here!

44:15.084 --> 44:17.584
- He put them in his mouth. take them away.
- Bites!

44:17.667 --> 44:19.750
- Hang him. - Yup.

44:21.875 --> 44:25.542
Either you spit them out or
hang yourself at the first tree.

44:35.417 --> 44:39.625
He still moves one leg slightly.

44:42.084 --> 44:46.334
We have to wait for him to
die. so he won't bite anymore.

44:46.917 --> 44:51.417
Then we open his mouth...
and remove the sequins.

44:51.625 --> 44:53.584
The sequins.

44:54.125 --> 44:57.292
- Let's go to the tavern.
- At the tavern.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.083
- Pinch. - Pinch.

45:01.167 --> 45:03.000
- A little something.
- A little something.

45:03.333 --> 45:04.750
Let's see.

45:07.375 --> 45:12.042
A few more pains. Let's wait.

45:18.708 --> 45:23.042
My dad. if you were here...

46:41.041 --> 46:45.916
Fairy?  The doctors have arrived.

46:45.999 --> 46:50.166
- Cricket also came.
- Get them in.

46:51.416 --> 46:55.083
Doctors!  Doctors. please come.

46:55.458 --> 46:59.166
Come. please.  Please Please.

47:07.416 --> 47:10.041
Did you pass the wax?

47:10.124 --> 47:13.708
Sorry.  You know. the Snail...

47:15.124 --> 47:17.499
However...

47:17.708 --> 47:22.208
Okay. let's see this sick. up.

47:23.208 --> 47:26.416
Breathe.  Harder!

47:28.916 --> 47:32.874
We are faced with a very
trivial case of acute tronchite.

47:32.958 --> 47:34.833
You have acute tronchitis!

47:34.916 --> 47:38.166
- What do you say. Doctor Corvanti?
- Because?

47:38.249 --> 47:41.624
This is a very serious
case of morbus lignorum

47:41.707 --> 47:45.332
- commonly called lignite.
- You have the morbus lignotus!

47:45.416 --> 47:50.707
- What did I tell you? You never listen!
- Can you show me the grain?

47:50.791 --> 47:53.999
Yes. there is the grain.
but there is also the peeling.

47:54.082 --> 47:58.041
- You need a resin wrap.
- You specialize in "woody"

47:58.124 --> 48:03.207
- but here we are talking about acute
tronchite. - What is the diagnosis?

48:03.291 --> 48:05.791
Will this puppet live or die?

48:05.874 --> 48:09.041
- The puppet will live.
- The puppet will die.

48:09.124 --> 48:10.291
- Like? - Gonna die.

48:10.374 --> 48:12.791
- Nothing to do. it's "woody".
- Quiet.

48:12.957 --> 48:17.082
- Shut up. it's chipy.
- Gonna die. Gonna die!

48:17.166 --> 48:20.541
- Go away!
- Pinocchio. I warned you!

48:20.624 --> 48:23.874
You didn't listen to me.
I have told you many times.

48:23.957 --> 48:27.499
You have to listen to me.
You have to listen to me!

48:27.707 --> 48:30.749
All right?  Bye see you.

48:38.290 --> 48:39.624
Ouch!

48:58.665 --> 49:01.290
Hurry up. the puppet is hot!

49:02.707 --> 49:05.207
Calmly.

49:05.374 --> 49:09.415
Everything takes its time.

49:09.707 --> 49:13.582
Things are done slowly.

49:14.290 --> 49:18.165
If you take this medicine.
you will recover in a few days.

49:18.499 --> 49:22.999
- Is it sweet or bitter? - It's bitter.
but trust me. it will do you good.

49:23.082 --> 49:24.748
I can not do it.

49:25.040 --> 49:29.665
- Come on. Pinocchio. it's just a medicine!
- Amara.

49:30.165 --> 49:32.415
How many stories...

49:33.623 --> 49:37.040
If you don't take it. you will never heal.

49:39.290 --> 49:42.873
- It's not true.
- Yes. Pinocchio. your illness is serious.

49:43.040 --> 49:45.248
- I don't care. - Ah. no?

49:45.332 --> 49:46.832
- No. - And are you then die?

49:47.248 --> 49:48.582
I don't care.

49:48.665 --> 49:50.832
- Ah. don't you care? - No.

49:51.707 --> 49:53.748
- Aren't you afraid of death?
- No.

49:53.832 --> 49:55.915
- No? - No.

49:57.207 --> 49:59.540
We'll see.  Send them in.

50:00.373 --> 50:02.582
- We'll see. - Come on!

50:02.832 --> 50:05.373
- You are welcome. - Here.

50:09.540 --> 50:12.540
- Here. here. - You slip!

50:13.582 --> 50:15.915
But... who are those?

50:17.290 --> 50:20.873
You didn't take the medicine
and they came to get you.

50:20.956 --> 50:22.706
How to "get me"?

50:22.831 --> 50:25.956
I don't want to die!
Please. Fairy!

50:27.831 --> 50:31.623
- What can I do?
- Please give me the medicine!

50:31.748 --> 50:33.165
Wait.

50:34.706 --> 50:39.040
- Now he wants to take medicine.
- No. the call was made.

50:39.206 --> 50:41.748
With the coffin empty.
we cannot go back.

50:41.831 --> 50:43.873
I'm sorry. Pinocchio.

50:44.206 --> 50:47.040
- It is so.
- You had to think about it first.

50:47.206 --> 50:50.456
The call has been made and the coffin
needs to be filled. Quite right?

50:50.540 --> 50:51.415
Yup!

50:51.498 --> 50:54.748
- How. should it be filled?
- Give me a hand.

50:56.248 --> 50:58.540
No!  No!

50:58.873 --> 51:02.540
- Please! I don't want to die. please!
- Wait!

51:04.456 --> 51:09.414
- Go. - What a pity to go back
to an empty coffin. isn't it?

51:09.789 --> 51:12.664
- Eh! Here we go. - Here we go.

51:12.998 --> 51:16.081
At three o'clock.
One two Three. Go.

51:16.331 --> 51:18.831
- Are they gone? - No.

51:19.081 --> 51:21.581
- Are they leaving? - Yup.

51:21.664 --> 51:22.581
Here.

51:22.664 --> 51:25.581
- Now? Are they gone? - No.

51:28.373 --> 51:30.664
- Watch out. - Now?

51:30.831 --> 51:33.706
Stairs!

51:33.831 --> 51:35.914
- Ouch. - Yup.

51:36.956 --> 51:40.164
Come on.
now go out and take this medicine.

51:49.123 --> 51:51.498
Well. now that you're healed

51:51.581 --> 51:55.039
why don't you tell me
what happened to you?

51:56.498 --> 52:00.414
- I was in the Puppet Theater...
- And why?

52:01.956 --> 52:04.956
- Well. the school was closed.
- Mmh.

52:05.622 --> 52:08.039
I was waiting for it to reopen

52:08.706 --> 52:12.122
therefore I went to
the Puppet Theater.

52:12.206 --> 52:13.247
Hmm.

52:13.497 --> 52:15.997
And did you come in without paying?

52:17.497 --> 52:20.872
Yes. They let me in like this.

52:24.414 --> 52:29.872
- What is happening?
- Nothing. Leave it.

52:30.206 --> 52:31.789
And then?  Tell me.

52:32.206 --> 52:36.247
There was Mangiafuoco.
who gave me five gold sequins.

52:36.331 --> 52:37.372
Then?

52:37.956 --> 52:42.581
I lost them and I met
two killers in the woods.

52:42.831 --> 52:46.872
And tell me.
there was no one who told you

52:47.122 --> 52:49.747
to be careful and listen to him?

52:50.289 --> 52:53.247
No. I haven't seen anyone.

52:57.997 --> 53:00.080
But what's going on in the nose?

53:00.164 --> 53:05.039
Nothing. You told lies and
now your nose is growing.

53:05.122 --> 53:07.914
Be careful where you point it.

53:09.789 --> 53:11.247
How... But...

53:15.247 --> 53:18.122
Oh no!

53:18.289 --> 53:21.747
Stop him! Stop it.
otherwise it will break everything!

53:21.830 --> 53:23.705
Ouch!  Oh!

53:23.789 --> 53:27.539
No. be careful. don't hurt me.
Don't hurt me!

53:30.247 --> 53:33.164
- Stop it. please. It breaks everything.
- Yes. yes.

53:33.247 --> 53:34.289
Ouch!

53:40.997 --> 53:42.455
Ouch.

54:47.955 --> 54:49.413
You are here?

54:56.621 --> 54:57.871
Bu!

55:06.871 --> 55:10.871
Now hold on. hold on
tight. which I accelerate.

55:10.955 --> 55:14.746
Ready?  Street!

55:15.788 --> 55:17.871
See how I run!

55:20.663 --> 55:24.038
"He was going..."

55:24.121 --> 55:28.621
"always covered..."

55:28.705 --> 55:31.080
"from her hair..."

55:31.163 --> 55:33.579
As soon as he falls
asleep we go to play.

55:35.329 --> 55:37.538
"With in chief..."

55:39.746 --> 55:43.246
"a wreath of flowers..."

55:44.454 --> 55:46.246
Go.

55:46.413 --> 55:48.496
"And with clothes"

55:48.663 --> 55:53.788
"all studded with diamonds."

56:24.371 --> 56:29.246
Now go. Pinocchio.
Find your dad and then come back here.

56:29.537 --> 56:33.996
- Please. be careful.
- All right. Hi. Fairy.

56:34.287 --> 56:35.871
Hi.

56:35.954 --> 56:38.454
Medoro?  Say hello to Pinocchio.

56:40.371 --> 56:42.454
Hi.

57:19.037 --> 57:20.370
Pss!

57:20.954 --> 57:23.412
Come on!  A bite!

57:25.495 --> 57:27.412
Pss!  Pss!

57:27.537 --> 57:29.620
Let us tickle!

57:33.662 --> 57:35.995
- Pinocchio! - Pinocchio!

57:36.745 --> 57:39.995
- Friends!
- It's nice to see you again.

57:40.204 --> 57:43.079
But... what are you doing here?

57:43.745 --> 57:45.995
We are waiting for
a table to clear.

57:46.079 --> 57:47.037
Table.

57:47.120 --> 57:50.579
- To tickle. We like it. do you remember?
- Pinch.

57:50.829 --> 57:54.912
- Where have you been?
- I? But what happened to you?

57:54.995 --> 57:58.162
- We were looking for you!
- Looking for.

57:58.245 --> 58:01.745
- If you knew how much we looked for you!
- Looked for.

58:01.829 --> 58:04.037
- What happened to you?
- Success?

58:04.120 --> 58:07.995
I was walking in the woods
and met with murderers.

58:08.120 --> 58:10.370
- Assassins?
- Yes. I tried to escape...

58:10.454 --> 58:14.870
Sorry if I interrupt you.
Who were these killers? You do not know?

58:15.037 --> 58:16.453
- No. - Ah!

58:16.537 --> 58:18.578
I wanted...
It was to say. Tell me.

58:18.662 --> 58:21.578
I asked a house for help.
but they didn't open me.

58:21.662 --> 58:25.662
The killers took me and
hanged me from the tree.

58:25.745 --> 58:29.412
- The next day the Fairy saved me.
- Ah.

58:30.120 --> 58:32.412
- The Fairy... - The Fairy.

58:32.495 --> 58:35.287
The killers had hanged me.

58:35.578 --> 58:38.703
- And the Fairy saved you.
- Yup.

58:40.078 --> 58:43.370
One question: do you
always have coins?

58:43.453 --> 58:47.495
- Yes. they stay here.
- Oh yes? How beautiful! See. friends?

58:47.578 --> 58:49.828
- Friends! Friends!
- What are we doing?

58:49.912 --> 58:50.953
But...

58:51.828 --> 58:54.703
- Who is it? - Leftovers today.

58:55.828 --> 58:57.162
What am I doing?

58:57.245 --> 59:00.162
What you did the other
time. you eat them.

59:01.662 --> 59:04.745
But sorry. but... What is it?
Can you give me leftovers?

59:04.828 --> 59:05.745
Leftovers.

59:05.828 --> 59:08.161
- We were waiting for the table.
- Table.

59:08.245 --> 59:10.411
- What leftovers? - What?

59:10.495 --> 59:12.536
- There is an error! - Error!

59:12.620 --> 59:14.620
- There is an error. - Error!

59:15.453 --> 59:17.703
Wait a moment.  Which is?

59:18.411 --> 59:23.036
They are leftovers! So. let it be
known: these leftovers are not for us!

59:23.120 --> 59:24.036
No!

59:24.120 --> 59:26.370
I can also eat them.
but in protest.

59:26.453 --> 59:27.495
Protest!

59:28.203 --> 59:31.036
Let's go to the Field of Miracles.
Do you always have all the coins?

59:31.120 --> 59:33.870
- Yes we go.

59:35.953 --> 59:39.411
Here. Pinocchio. this is the
Field of Miracles. Do you like?

59:39.536 --> 59:41.870
Eh?  Beautiful.

59:45.203 --> 59:47.286
- So? - Dig well. Yes good.

59:47.370 --> 59:49.078
- Good boy. - Good.

59:49.161 --> 59:50.453
- Perfect. - Perfect.

59:50.536 --> 59:52.370
The sequins now.

59:59.619 --> 01:00:00.911
Stop. stop.

01:00:01.744 --> 01:00:03.244
- Camouflage. camouflage.
- Camouflages.

01:00:03.328 --> 01:00:04.369
With leaves.

01:00:05.453 --> 01:00:08.494
Perfect.
Now it takes water to water.

01:00:08.953 --> 01:00:12.286
- Water. water.
- I can't go for the leg.

01:00:12.494 --> 01:00:15.744
- He doesn't see us. Then go you.
- I can not see.

01:00:15.828 --> 01:00:21.203
Do one thing. See those trees?
Ditch them and you will find a pond.

01:00:21.286 --> 01:00:24.494
- Get some water. Plentiful water.
- Water.

01:00:24.661 --> 01:00:27.869
- We water and the seedling blooms.
- Blooms.

01:00:28.203 --> 01:00:29.619
- I go? - Go!

01:00:29.703 --> 01:00:32.244
- Go.
- After the trees. Go. Pinocchio.

01:00:35.494 --> 01:00:39.244
Go Go.  Go. Pinocchio. disappear.

01:00:41.286 --> 01:00:42.911
- Here? - No. go!

01:00:42.994 --> 01:00:45.078
- Go! - A little further!

01:00:45.161 --> 01:00:47.369
- Run. Pinocchio! - Go!

01:00:47.453 --> 01:00:50.619
Ditch the trees.
Behind there is the pond.

01:00:51.994 --> 01:00:57.577
- Go! Disappear. sink into the pond.
- Go!

01:00:57.661 --> 01:01:00.744
He has gone.  He has gone.

01:01:21.036 --> 01:01:23.327
Friends. where are you?

01:01:28.536 --> 01:01:30.036
Friends?

01:01:47.577 --> 01:01:51.119
Cat and Fox told me about
the Campo dei Miracoli

01:01:51.202 --> 01:01:55.452
where you put the coins and then
a lot of gold sequins come out.

01:01:55.535 --> 01:01:57.785
How?  Speak louder.

01:01:57.869 --> 01:02:02.494
They said. "Go get some
water to water the hole."

01:02:03.285 --> 01:02:06.785
And then. when I came back

01:02:07.077 --> 01:02:11.660
because I had to water
the sequins I had put...

01:02:14.577 --> 01:02:16.327
Did you water the sequins?

01:02:16.785 --> 01:02:20.952
- Yes. why... - Did they ask?

01:02:21.202 --> 01:02:25.535
I had to make a hole and
then close it and water.

01:02:25.619 --> 01:02:27.077
No!  No!

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:31.410
When I returned.
the sequins were gone.

01:02:31.494 --> 01:02:34.285
- Was there the hole without the sequins?
- Yup.

01:02:34.369 --> 01:02:37.077
Oh. poor thing!

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.118
And who were they?  Who were they?

01:02:39.202 --> 01:02:41.910
- Cat and Fox. - Cat and Fox?

01:02:42.118 --> 01:02:45.035
- Do we know a cat and a fox?
- No.

01:02:45.118 --> 01:02:49.702
We don't know a cat and a fox.

01:02:49.993 --> 01:02:52.577
So what do you want?  What are you asking for?

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:56.493
I ask for justice.
that the four gold sequins give me back

01:02:56.577 --> 01:02:59.577
plus one who made me
spend at Gambero Rosso

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:01.952
because they ate only them.

01:03:04.243 --> 01:03:05.577
Oh.

01:03:06.327 --> 01:03:07.702
Oh. oh.

01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:09.618
You want...

01:03:11.285 --> 01:03:15.910
Eh!  Hmm.  Mah...

01:03:16.202 --> 01:03:19.327
Well. what...
So they robbed you?

01:03:19.952 --> 01:03:23.535
- Yes.
- You have been robbed. you are innocent!

01:03:24.618 --> 01:03:27.827
- Put him in prison!
- How. in prison?

01:03:28.285 --> 01:03:32.118
- But I'm innocent!
- He who is innocent goes to prison!

01:03:32.201 --> 01:03:35.701
- Because?
- This is how it works in this country.

01:03:35.785 --> 01:03:40.285
- But... why in prison?
- The innocent go to prison.

01:03:40.535 --> 01:03:44.035
Yet I have one thing
to say: I'm guilty too!

01:03:44.118 --> 01:03:47.160
Wait. wait. wait.
What are you saying?

01:03:47.368 --> 01:03:51.243
- I'm guilty too.
- Come here. Come here.

01:03:55.118 --> 01:03:57.201
I am also a thief.

01:04:01.201 --> 01:04:02.701
What did you steal?

01:04:02.785 --> 01:04:07.618
- I stole a pig.
- A pig? A pig is a little bit.

01:04:09.201 --> 01:04:15.160
- Even a hen.
- Hen. pig... No. no. no!

01:04:15.243 --> 01:04:18.368
It's not good. no. no. no.
More. more. more.

01:04:18.701 --> 01:04:21.743
Now that I remember.
I also stole a jewel.

01:04:24.409 --> 01:04:27.284
A jewel?

01:04:27.618 --> 01:04:31.076
- Yes. all gold and silver.
- So yes!

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:35.868
Good boy! Bravo. bravo. bravo!
Free him!

01:04:36.326 --> 01:04:38.826
Good. congrats.

01:04:39.284 --> 01:04:44.993
Think. I stole so much stuff
that I don't remember it anymore.

01:05:49.492 --> 01:05:54.534
Babbino! Babbino!
I'm Pinocchio. it's me!

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:57.576
- Open me!
- Pinocchio! What are you doing?

01:05:58.867 --> 01:06:03.826
Your father is no longer here.
It's been a long time since he left.

01:06:03.909 --> 01:06:07.617
- He came looking for you.
- Where did he come to look for me?

01:06:07.742 --> 01:06:11.659
He said he would go
anywhere to find you.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.617
He was desperate. crying.

01:06:14.909 --> 01:06:19.450
He said. "I'm going to the end of the world
to look for him. in the great Americas."

01:06:19.534 --> 01:06:22.742
- "I have to find it."
- Where are the great Americas?

01:06:22.825 --> 01:06:25.617
I'm far away.

01:06:26.659 --> 01:06:29.367
You have to cross the sea to go.

01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:30.700
Where's the sea?

01:06:30.784 --> 01:06:33.034
Honey. the sea is far away.

01:06:33.909 --> 01:06:36.117
He was looking for you. honey.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.200
Go!  Watch out!  Run!

01:06:40.409 --> 01:06:42.659
Come back!

01:06:43.117 --> 01:06:49.367
It's dangerous!
There is the rough sea! Come back!

01:06:51.867 --> 01:06:56.034
Come back!  Back!

01:06:58.034 --> 01:07:00.575
You will never make it!

01:07:04.492 --> 01:07:06.575
Back!

01:08:15.616 --> 01:08:21.325
Eh... Slowly. slowly. without haste.

01:08:21.991 --> 01:08:24.075
Snail!

01:08:25.616 --> 01:08:29.450
Oh!

01:08:33.033 --> 01:08:34.700
But the Fairy?

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:49.741
- It's gotten... big. - Eh.

01:08:49.823 --> 01:08:50.866
Go.

01:08:56.073 --> 01:08:59.198
- Why is it big? - And she. Go.

01:09:01.533 --> 01:09:07.198
- The same dress. the same hair...
- It's me.

01:09:09.323 --> 01:09:10.783
How did you do that?

01:09:11.573 --> 01:09:12.908
It's a secret.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.158
Go!

01:09:38.783 --> 01:09:42.282
But... how did you get older?

01:09:42.366 --> 01:09:46.532
- I also want to grow up.
- But you can't grow.

01:09:47.907 --> 01:09:53.157
- Because?
- Because puppets never grow.

01:09:53.698 --> 01:09:58.032
Puppets are born. puppets live

01:09:58.116 --> 01:10:00.157
puppets die.

01:10:01.449 --> 01:10:05.199
But... I don't want to
be a puppet all my life.

01:10:06.282 --> 01:10:09.366
I want to become a kid
like everyone else.

01:10:09.449 --> 01:10:10.657
You will become one

01:10:10.949 --> 01:10:15.657
if you know how to deserve
it and if you behave well.

01:10:16.241 --> 01:10:20.366
But... how do I deserve it?

01:10:20.782 --> 01:10:24.241
You have to get used
to being a good puppet.

01:10:24.366 --> 01:10:28.366
Then from tomorrow you will
go to school and study.

01:10:29.407 --> 01:10:33.199
- Repeat.
- You will go to school and study.

01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:36.574
- School? - Yup.

01:10:37.365 --> 01:10:40.782
So. let's see if you've studied.

01:10:41.699 --> 01:10:45.782
In a fence there are 18 sheep.

01:10:45.907 --> 01:10:48.282
Seven in the night run away.

01:10:49.199 --> 01:10:54.115
How many sheep does the
farmer find in the morning?

01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:59.824
Eight?

01:11:00.032 --> 01:11:01.365
The hand.

01:11:05.157 --> 01:11:06.824
On chickpeas!

01:11:08.324 --> 01:11:10.115
Oh!

01:11:12.365 --> 01:11:14.532
Come on.

01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:20.449
Come here. come on.  Here.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:25.240
Take off your hat in front of the teacher.
From here on. stay here. understand?

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:28.073
Just leave it here. I'll take care of it.

01:11:29.907 --> 01:11:32.282
Let's see if you're prepared.

01:11:33.907 --> 01:11:36.948
Eighteen pears. for two.

01:11:39.282 --> 01:11:41.448
Hmm.  You do not know?

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:45.323
- I do not know. - You do not
know? You do not know? The hand.

01:11:46.407 --> 01:11:48.990
- Ah! - On chickpeas.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:53.198
On chickpeas.

01:11:56.865 --> 01:12:00.990
And now copy what I write.

01:12:02.115 --> 01:12:06.532
"The teacher..."

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:13.740
"it's a second..."

01:12:15.198 --> 01:12:17.323
"father..."

01:12:19.281 --> 01:12:25.531
"for his..."

01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:32.573
"Pupils."

01:12:32.656 --> 01:12:34.573
But...

01:12:34.698 --> 01:12:37.531
Oh!

01:12:41.865 --> 01:12:44.990
Hey!  Hey!  Hey.

01:12:57.698 --> 01:13:00.490
Ah!

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:05.615
Ah!

01:13:06.656 --> 01:13:09.323
Ah!

01:13:15.239 --> 01:13:19.114
- Wait for me! I come with you!
- Come.

01:14:20.239 --> 01:14:23.906
Tomorrow we go to steal in a place
where they have... sausages.

01:14:23.989 --> 01:14:28.947
hams. cheeses.
but we must be careful

01:14:29.447 --> 01:14:33.489
because the last time the
owner gave me a beating. Look.

01:14:37.947 --> 01:14:41.114
Who is it?

01:14:41.197 --> 01:14:44.364
Who is it that knocks
at this time of night?

01:14:46.572 --> 01:14:48.989
- It's me! - I who?

01:14:50.781 --> 01:14:53.947
- Pinocchio. - Pinocchio who?

01:14:54.781 --> 01:14:57.030
The wooden puppet!

01:14:57.114 --> 01:15:02.864
Ah. that puppet who
had promised his Fairy

01:15:02.947 --> 01:15:06.697
to go to school. to study...

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:10.405
and then he ran away.  Oh.

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:13.280
That puppet there?  Are you sure?

01:15:13.947 --> 01:15:17.947
Yes. that puppet.
Please open me?

01:15:20.114 --> 01:15:21.405
Do you open me?

01:15:23.072 --> 01:15:26.239
I promise you. I will never run away!

01:15:32.947 --> 01:15:34.530
Do you open me?

01:15:43.655 --> 01:15:47.489
Snail!  Open up. please!

01:16:05.488 --> 01:16:07.238
Pinocchio?

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:10.530
Pinocchio!

01:16:13.697 --> 01:16:19.155
The fairy said that this
time she forgives you

01:16:19.863 --> 01:16:22.947
but next time he won't
let you in anymore.

01:16:23.488 --> 01:16:24.697
Here.

01:16:25.405 --> 01:16:28.613
Go to school and be good.

01:16:33.488 --> 01:16:39.197
"Who... doesn't... go to school..."

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.530
- "grows... ignorant."
- Where is Lucignolo?

01:16:42.613 --> 01:16:45.321
- He doesn't come anymore.
- Because?

01:16:45.488 --> 01:16:49.280
- I do not know.
- Work in the fields with his father.

01:16:49.363 --> 01:16:54.030
- Why are you going?
- I do not know.

01:16:54.113 --> 01:16:56.113
- How long is it back?
- I do not know.

01:16:56.571 --> 01:17:00.696
We don't talk during the lesson!
The hands!

01:17:03.613 --> 01:17:06.738
- Don't you feel pain? - No.

01:17:16.530 --> 01:17:18.780
"The good children..."

01:17:55.321 --> 01:17:57.404
Two.

01:18:00.988 --> 01:18:02.821
So good.

01:18:05.904 --> 01:18:09.071
"When..."

01:18:09.988 --> 01:18:13.279
"he came..."

01:18:13.363 --> 01:18:17.113
"to know..."

01:18:17.196 --> 01:18:21.238
Now let's do a little magic.

01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.238
- Magic? - Yup.

01:18:25.071 --> 01:18:26.821
Do this.

01:18:32.321 --> 01:18:35.279
"TO..."

01:18:35.362 --> 01:18:39.696
"Resolute soul. he thought..."

01:18:39.779 --> 01:18:45.862
- "to send a magnificent..."
- Go.

01:18:45.946 --> 01:18:47.737
"Carriage."

01:19:10.904 --> 01:19:15.279
A shepherd in a
paddock has 300 sheep.

01:19:15.446 --> 01:19:19.696
In the night 47 escape.
but three return immediately.

01:19:19.779 --> 01:19:24.029
Then 24 get sick.
nine die and the rest heal.

01:19:24.112 --> 01:19:28.029
Then two run away.  How much it does?  Hmm?

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:36.570
Does 245?

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:47.570
Quite right.  Right. Pinocchio.  Good boy.

01:19:48.112 --> 01:19:51.445
Have you seen how
good Pinocchio became?

01:19:51.695 --> 01:19:55.862
I'll give you a nice ten and praise.

01:19:55.945 --> 01:19:58.695
Full marks.

01:19:58.862 --> 01:20:00.862
Always like that.

01:20:00.945 --> 01:20:05.695
Make the ball and
then crush the ball.

01:20:05.779 --> 01:20:07.570
We have to do many

01:20:07.654 --> 01:20:13.653
because tomorrow we
have a nice party here.

01:20:13.945 --> 01:20:16.403
Party?

01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:19.570
A beautiful party.

01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:26.028
The master says you are good.

01:20:26.112 --> 01:20:30.612
So... tomorrow you'll
finish being a puppet

01:20:30.862 --> 01:20:35.320
and you will become a
child like everyone else.

01:20:45.528 --> 01:20:51.028
What are you waiting for?
Hurry to invite your friends. Run!

01:20:57.570 --> 01:21:01.278
- Wick! - wick?

01:21:01.362 --> 01:21:03.445
Wick!

01:21:06.237 --> 01:21:08.320
Wick!

01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:15.445
- wick.
- Shh! Go away. which you make me discover.

01:21:15.945 --> 01:21:18.778
- Something happened. - Wick!

01:21:18.861 --> 01:21:22.320
I finish being... a puppet.

01:21:22.403 --> 01:21:24.820
- I become a child. - Strong.

01:21:24.903 --> 01:21:27.736
There is a party at my house
tomorrow. are you coming?

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:30.695
- No. I can not. - Because?

01:21:30.778 --> 01:21:34.070
- At midnight I have to leave.
- Where are you going?

01:21:34.361 --> 01:21:36.361
- I'm going to a country...
- Wick!

01:21:36.445 --> 01:21:38.445
I go to a beautiful country

01:21:38.528 --> 01:21:42.111
the most beautiful in the world.
It's called the Land of Toys.

01:21:42.653 --> 01:21:45.278
You play. run. jump all day.

01:21:45.653 --> 01:21:48.820
Do what you want.
There are no rules or masters.

01:21:48.903 --> 01:21:52.570
We just have fun.
If you want. you can come.

01:21:52.653 --> 01:21:57.028
If I catch you. they do the math!
Wick!

01:21:57.903 --> 01:22:02.153
- But I care about becoming a child.
- Then don't come.

01:22:02.236 --> 01:22:04.319
I go.  Hi.

01:22:06.736 --> 01:22:09.236
Where are you going?  But why?

01:22:24.486 --> 01:22:28.194
- Are you sure this cart arrives?
- Yes I'm sure.

01:22:34.736 --> 01:22:38.194
- But I don't see it!
- Now it comes.

01:22:39.194 --> 01:22:41.528
It takes a lot. but then you have fun.

01:22:42.153 --> 01:22:46.361
I told you I was going to
accompany you here and then I left.

01:22:48.153 --> 01:22:49.986
Come on. come on.

01:22:51.028 --> 01:22:52.861
Come. you're having fun!

01:22:58.111 --> 01:22:59.736
Oh. there it is.

01:23:00.694 --> 01:23:03.944
- Hi. Pinocchio. I go.
- Hi. Lucignolo.

01:23:25.694 --> 01:23:30.152
And you. my love.
will you come with us or will you stay?

01:23:32.277 --> 01:23:34.902
Come on. call him.  Come on. kids.

01:23:34.986 --> 01:23:38.694
- Come! Come! - Look? Come!

01:23:38.861 --> 01:23:41.861
- Come. Come! - Come! Come!

01:23:41.944 --> 01:23:45.027
- Come! Come! - Come!

01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:47.694
They all call you. can you hear it?

01:23:47.777 --> 01:23:51.610
So come on. get on the cart.
Come!

01:23:51.694 --> 01:23:54.360
You will have fun. I promise you.

01:23:54.444 --> 01:23:56.819
Come!  Come!

01:24:32.277 --> 01:24:34.569
We have arrived. cupids.

01:24:34.652 --> 01:24:39.027
Now get off. I recommend. but calmly.
Without hurting you.

01:24:39.193 --> 01:24:41.693
Come on. get off.  Come.

01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:44.485
I'll help you. come.  Come on!  Come.

01:24:45.485 --> 01:24:47.193
Love.

01:24:49.193 --> 01:24:51.568
Come on.  Come on. come on. come on.

01:25:26.277 --> 01:25:28.360
Come come.

01:25:35.193 --> 01:25:41.526
Come on come on!
Pull. pull! Strong!

01:25:59.318 --> 01:26:01.401
Nineteen...

01:26:02.735 --> 01:26:06.610
twenty... twenty one...

01:26:06.776 --> 01:26:09.276
Here?  This is all right.

01:26:09.943 --> 01:26:12.735
- Goodnight. cupids.
- Good night.

01:26:12.818 --> 01:26:14.901
See you tomorrow.

01:26:16.651 --> 01:26:21.110
Twenty seven... twenty eight...

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.776
Tomorrow we will have fun.

01:26:24.943 --> 01:26:28.651
Twenty nine... thirty.

01:26:28.734 --> 01:26:31.151
Good night.

01:26:54.984 --> 01:26:58.193
- Who is it? - It's me. open up!

01:26:58.901 --> 01:27:00.318
Now I can not.

01:27:00.526 --> 01:27:04.984
By any chance. did you also
wake up with strange ears today?

01:27:05.609 --> 01:27:07.859
To tell the truth. a little yes.

01:27:07.943 --> 01:27:11.151
Well. let me in! Open me. fast!

01:27:17.359 --> 01:27:20.401
I think we have
the same problem.

01:27:22.276 --> 01:27:23.984
I think so.

01:27:25.609 --> 01:27:30.192
- Come on. take off the sack.
- Take it off first. right?

01:27:31.817 --> 01:27:35.567
Okay. let's do this:
at three we get it up.

01:27:35.692 --> 01:27:38.067
One two Three.

01:27:42.359 --> 01:27:45.567
- What ears do you have?
- What ears do you have?

01:27:45.734 --> 01:27:47.984
- Ouch. - It hurts?

01:27:48.234 --> 01:27:50.401
- Yes. - Ouch! However...

01:27:52.067 --> 01:27:56.859
- We can't go around like this.
- Indeed...

01:27:57.859 --> 01:27:59.942
- Oh my God. I can't stand up.
- What...

01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:01.151
Help me!

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:03.734
- Ouch! - What's wrong with you?

01:28:03.817 --> 01:28:05.859
What is happening?

01:28:05.942 --> 01:28:09.775
- Help! - Ouch!

01:28:11.442 --> 01:28:13.525
Help.

01:28:15.317 --> 01:28:19.150
- Ah! - Ouch! Ouch!

01:28:19.775 --> 01:28:23.275
The hand!

01:28:23.692 --> 01:28:28.900
- Help! Help!
- Help! Pinocchio. help me!

01:28:29.692 --> 01:28:33.234
Help!

01:28:33.859 --> 01:28:36.609
Help us!

01:28:41.525 --> 01:28:43.567
Help!

01:28:43.650 --> 01:28:48.484
Help!  Help!

01:29:04.983 --> 01:29:06.650
Cupids?

01:29:06.733 --> 01:29:09.858
I recognized you. cupids.

01:29:10.942 --> 01:29:14.317
Oh. I hear you!

01:29:14.483 --> 01:29:19.608
Cupids. how brayed well!

01:29:22.358 --> 01:29:25.900
Here I am. cupids.

01:29:57.941 --> 01:30:02.441
This donkey is called Lucignolo.

01:30:03.525 --> 01:30:05.400
He is very brave.

01:30:06.608 --> 01:30:09.191
It has extraordinary strength.

01:30:10.691 --> 01:30:15.150
For what you need.
it seems perfect.

01:30:16.441 --> 01:30:18.691
- It seems to me a beautiful animal.
- Thank you.

01:30:19.525 --> 01:30:23.900
Wait a moment.
This scar here on the forehead?

01:30:23.983 --> 01:30:26.733
- But...
- No. no. no. scars no.

01:30:26.816 --> 01:30:28.900
- No? - It brings sadness.

01:30:28.983 --> 01:30:31.316
- Ah. - I don't take it.

01:30:31.608 --> 01:30:34.941
Okay. so we have another donkey.
Here it is.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:40.733
It's called Pinocchio.
He is extremely intelligent! Eh!

01:30:41.816 --> 01:30:44.316
It is docile. gentle...

01:30:48.483 --> 01:30:51.983
And then... learn immediately.

01:30:52.066 --> 01:30:55.858
- He learns right away. really.
- Hey.

01:30:56.399 --> 01:30:59.399
For the numbers it will have to do

01:30:59.816 --> 01:31:02.899
it is extraordinary.
in my humble opinion.

01:31:02.983 --> 01:31:05.066
Hey.

01:31:19.733 --> 01:31:24.316
He is back from a long and
glorious tour in the Indies

01:31:24.399 --> 01:31:26.941
and in the distant lands of America.

01:31:27.066 --> 01:31:32.774
Gentlemen. tonight he will perform
for you in unparalleled numbers

01:31:32.941 --> 01:31:37.608
unsurpassed. never seen before!

01:31:37.691 --> 01:31:41.107
Mesdames et messieurs. here you are

01:31:41.191 --> 01:31:44.399

01:31:44.482 --> 01:31:46.982
Applause!

01:31:51.566 --> 01:31:56.149
There he is!  Here he is. with his clown!

01:31:56.232 --> 01:31:58.607
Cheerful. cheerful.

01:31:58.691 --> 01:32:03.357
Well done! Now. the tallest man
and the smallest man in the world

01:32:03.441 --> 01:32:08.399
together to bring the circle of fire!
Applause!

01:32:11.691 --> 01:32:14.149
And now. ladies and gentlemen

01:32:14.232 --> 01:32:17.566
i know this can
be an awesome game

01:32:17.649 --> 01:32:22.191
too dangerous.
but we know what we do.

01:32:22.274 --> 01:32:25.607
We are ready.  Drum roller.

01:32:25.691 --> 01:32:30.899
I want an applause of encouragement.
One. two and three!

01:32:30.982 --> 01:32:34.857
Oh!

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:40.149
Yet!  Another!  Street!

01:32:41.982 --> 01:32:46.357
Just another!  One. two and three!

01:32:53.524 --> 01:32:58.357
Pinocchio has not fallen.
It's a game we've played with you

01:32:58.565 --> 01:33:03.732
to make this show extraordinary.
Can't stumble!

01:33:03.815 --> 01:33:05.815
Take it away.

01:33:05.899 --> 01:33:10.940
We call the strongest man in the world
to take the donkey Pinocchio away.

01:33:11.024 --> 01:33:14.149
An applause for the
strongest man in the world.

01:33:14.232 --> 01:33:16.940
Here they are together.

01:33:17.065 --> 01:33:21.982
Look at the animal's skill.
look at how he pretends to limp.

01:33:22.065 --> 01:33:25.149
Here it is.
Again a round of applause. thank you.

01:33:25.482 --> 01:33:27.773
An applause!

01:33:35.398 --> 01:33:40.315
Unfortunately you are
crippled. my dear Pinocchio.

01:33:40.607 --> 01:33:44.023
The painful time to
say goodbye has come.

01:33:44.773 --> 01:33:49.440
We make a nice drum with this skin.
Overboard. up.

01:33:50.898 --> 01:33:56.107
One... two... and three!

01:34:04.482 --> 01:34:06.773
And now let's wait.

01:35:03.231 --> 01:35:04.898
What's up?

01:35:12.648 --> 01:35:13.898
Who are you?

01:35:16.564 --> 01:35:20.606
- Where did you put Pinocchio?
- It's me!

01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:25.398
- But how. "it's me"?
- Yes I am!

01:35:25.939 --> 01:35:28.314
- The donkey? - Yes. Pinocchio!

01:35:30.273 --> 01:35:34.106
- How is it possible?
- It's possible!

01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:37.023
Have you turned into water?

01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:40.898
Yup! You have not
reckoned with my Fairy!

01:35:42.731 --> 01:35:46.314
Oh!  A puppet who speaks.

01:35:46.981 --> 01:35:49.356
Eh?  It can serve us at the circus.

01:35:51.689 --> 01:35:55.231
Pinocchio!  Come here!

01:35:55.606 --> 01:35:59.231
- Come. I don't do anything to
you. come on. - Hi!

01:35:59.398 --> 01:36:01.856
- Come here! - Hi!

01:36:01.939 --> 01:36:03.606
Come on. don't go away!

01:36:03.856 --> 01:36:05.856
Come on. come on.

01:36:06.106 --> 01:36:08.314
- Dive. - No. no. no.

01:36:08.397 --> 01:36:10.397
- Dive! - You go.

01:36:10.481 --> 01:36:12.272
- It's an order! - You go.

01:36:12.356 --> 01:36:13.897
- Dive! - No!

01:36:14.814 --> 01:36:16.689
It's right.  You dive.

01:36:16.772 --> 01:36:18.231
- Why me? - You dive.

01:36:18.314 --> 01:36:20.522
- I can not swim.
- We throw you.

01:36:20.606 --> 01:36:24.022
- I'm afraid of water.
- I do not care!

01:36:24.439 --> 01:36:26.981
Take this...
Where are you going?

01:36:27.064 --> 01:36:29.439
- I can not swim. - Come here!

01:36:29.522 --> 01:36:33.439
- Come here. damn you.
- I can not swim.

01:36:33.522 --> 01:36:37.064
- Hi. Pinocchio. Hi!
- Come here! Hey!

01:36:59.272 --> 01:37:01.355
Help!

01:37:04.605 --> 01:37:07.897
Help!  Help!

01:37:33.605 --> 01:37:35.689
Help!

01:37:39.605 --> 01:37:41.230
Help!

01:37:41.564 --> 01:37:44.522
There is no point in shouting "help".

01:37:48.689 --> 01:37:50.730
Who do you want me to save you for?

01:37:53.730 --> 01:37:55.855
- Who are you? - I?

01:37:56.855 --> 01:37:59.438
I am a poor tuna

01:37:59.730 --> 01:38:04.022
who was swallowed by the
Pescecane just like you.

01:38:06.022 --> 01:38:08.813
And what kind of fish are you?

01:38:08.897 --> 01:38:12.105
I am not a fish. I am a puppet.

01:38:12.188 --> 01:38:13.272
Ah.

01:38:14.063 --> 01:38:18.980
If you are not a fish.
why did you get swallowed by the monster?

01:38:20.272 --> 01:38:23.063
I didn't get swallowed.
it was he who swallowed me.

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:24.438
Oh.

01:38:25.313 --> 01:38:30.688
- Now how do you do it?
- Eh... We must resign ourselves

01:38:30.772 --> 01:38:35.188
and wait for the Pescecane
to digest both of us.

01:38:35.272 --> 01:38:39.647
Digest?
But I don't want to be digested!

01:38:39.730 --> 01:38:42.980
I don't want to be digested either

01:38:44.271 --> 01:38:49.230
but I console myself with the
thought that when you are born tuna

01:38:51.188 --> 01:38:57.438
there is more satisfaction in
dying underwater... than in oil.

01:39:02.855 --> 01:39:05.980
In Oil?

01:39:10.396 --> 01:39:12.730
But... I want to
escape. I want to leave.

01:39:12.813 --> 01:39:14.438
Eh. run away...

01:39:15.146 --> 01:39:17.855
if you can.

01:39:21.521 --> 01:39:23.896
What is that light over there?

01:39:25.188 --> 01:39:28.105
And who knows?

01:39:28.188 --> 01:39:30.563
I want to go and see.

01:39:31.230 --> 01:39:36.146
- Well. goodbye. Tuna.
- Goodbye. puppet.

01:39:36.438 --> 01:39:39.854
I wish you good luck.

01:39:58.104 --> 01:39:59.896
Dad.

01:40:01.479 --> 01:40:03.396
Dad!

01:40:04.688 --> 01:40:07.896
- Pinocchio! - Dad! Dad!

01:40:08.563 --> 01:40:10.896
Pinocchio!

01:40:11.438 --> 01:40:13.021
Pinocchio!

01:40:14.771 --> 01:40:18.604
My son!  Pinocchio...

01:40:19.771 --> 01:40:21.854
How much I have looked for you!

01:40:22.729 --> 01:40:27.729
Pinocchio! Son.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

01:40:48.729 --> 01:40:51.562
It is not bad here in the end.

01:40:51.687 --> 01:40:56.687
It seems. but it's beautiful.
because then the Pescecane eats everything.

01:40:56.771 --> 01:41:00.854
There is fish. I have eaten many fish.
Look. there is a network.

01:41:00.937 --> 01:41:04.312
Now that you have arrived.
we can fish together.

01:41:04.396 --> 01:41:08.271
You get over there and I get over here.
We can catch big fish.

01:41:08.354 --> 01:41:10.854
Look what a beautiful place. with dishes.

01:41:10.937 --> 01:41:15.021
There is the bedroom.
There's room for you too.

01:41:15.771 --> 01:41:17.021
- Dad? - Yup?

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:18.521
We have to escape.

01:41:19.354 --> 01:41:21.854
- How. escape?
- Yes. we have to escape. dad.

01:41:21.979 --> 01:41:24.479
No. I would think about it a little longer.

01:41:24.812 --> 01:41:28.270
Now maybe you've seen
it so upside down

01:41:28.395 --> 01:41:31.562
because you came by
surprise. but I put it right

01:41:31.645 --> 01:41:34.187
becomes really beautiful.
Do you want to see her?

01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:35.354
- Dad? - Eh?

01:41:35.437 --> 01:41:38.270
We can't stay here.
we have to escape!

01:41:38.812 --> 01:41:41.270
I thought about it. but it's impossible.

01:41:41.354 --> 01:41:42.645
Come with me.

01:41:42.729 --> 01:41:46.270
- Pinocchio. it's impossible.
- Come on. dad!

01:42:06.854 --> 01:42:09.562
Dad!  Come on. come on!

01:42:10.062 --> 01:42:14.187
- No. better not.
- It's the right time. your mouth is open.

01:42:14.354 --> 01:42:16.228
It could shut it
down any minute.

01:42:16.312 --> 01:42:19.145
Are you sure?  Wait up.

01:42:19.603 --> 01:42:21.937
Come on. dad.  Come.

01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:23.687
Pinocchio...

01:42:24.687 --> 01:42:26.687
I can not swim.

01:42:28.353 --> 01:42:32.603
Don't worry if you can't
swim. I swim very well.

01:42:32.687 --> 01:42:36.520
- And then they are made of wood. I float.
- I know. I made you.

01:42:36.603 --> 01:42:41.062
But you're one meter tall.
you can't carry me on your shoulders.

01:42:41.145 --> 01:42:43.395
We both drown and die.

01:42:43.770 --> 01:42:47.603
Dad... I'll make it.

01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:51.978
Come with me.

01:42:53.478 --> 01:42:55.312
Here we go.  Here we go!

01:43:18.395 --> 01:43:19.936
Pinocchio. we drown!

01:43:23.603 --> 01:43:25.103
I can do it!

01:43:29.728 --> 01:43:32.311
Stick to me. puppet.

01:43:36.353 --> 01:43:38.645
Hold on tight to your fins.

01:43:40.145 --> 01:43:44.103
- Let's go! - Go. Tuna. go.

01:44:03.019 --> 01:44:06.936
- Thank's my friend.
- You don't have to thank me.

01:44:07.019 --> 01:44:10.603
If I managed to escape from
the mouth of the Pescecane

01:44:10.686 --> 01:44:13.811
it's because you gave me courage.

01:44:26.311 --> 01:44:29.269
But... why are you crying?

01:44:30.019 --> 01:44:34.228
Because nobody had
ever given me a kiss.

01:44:36.811 --> 01:44:40.603
- What's your name? - Pinocchio.

01:44:40.686 --> 01:44:45.228
Pinocchio.
I will always carry you in my heart.

01:44:46.686 --> 01:44:49.853
- Goodbye. Tuna. - Goodbye.

01:44:56.352 --> 01:45:00.102
Oh... how beautiful...

01:45:00.186 --> 01:45:03.352
What a nice person that Tuna. eh?

01:45:04.186 --> 01:45:08.102
To have known that he was
also inside the Pescecane

01:45:08.519 --> 01:45:12.727
we could have had a chat. Sin.

01:45:16.852 --> 01:45:18.436
- Dad! - Yup?

01:45:18.644 --> 01:45:19.686
Look!

01:45:20.561 --> 01:45:22.227
There. a house. over there!

01:45:24.227 --> 01:45:27.602
- Let's check.
- Let's go come on.

01:45:46.477 --> 01:45:47.894
Oh...

01:45:49.227 --> 01:45:50.810
Oh God.

01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:12.935
Sorry?  Could I have some milk?

01:46:13.019 --> 01:46:17.227
- How much do you want?
- Well. a little. How much can you give me?

01:46:17.435 --> 01:46:19.560
A bucket of milk costs a penny.

01:46:21.685 --> 01:46:23.394
I don't have a penny.

01:46:23.894 --> 01:46:26.602
Then I can't give you
anything. I'm sorry.

01:46:28.019 --> 01:46:30.644
But it is urgent. it serves my dad.

01:46:33.269 --> 01:46:36.435
My dad needs it. He is sick!

01:46:40.518 --> 01:46:43.852
- Do you want to turn the binding?
- What is the binding?

01:46:45.018 --> 01:46:46.810
But then. can you do it?

01:46:48.643 --> 01:46:50.893
- You'll make it?
- I can do it all.

01:46:50.977 --> 01:46:52.352
What is the binding?

01:46:52.435 --> 01:46:54.143
The bindolo is that deal over there.

01:47:46.768 --> 01:47:51.726
Go Go!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!

01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:55.893
Ah!  So!  Come on. Pinocchio.

01:47:55.976 --> 01:47:58.435
- Yes. - Bravo. Pinocchio.

01:47:58.518 --> 01:48:01.768
Now. Pinocchio. stay here.
Fermo.

01:48:12.935 --> 01:48:15.060
- Hi. Giangio. - Hi.

01:48:44.559 --> 01:48:46.851
There are five sheep.

01:48:48.476 --> 01:48:51.143
Three goats. beautiful fat.

01:48:51.684 --> 01:48:54.934
If you could see them...
There is a nice one.

01:48:55.601 --> 01:48:58.226
- And there is a guinea fowl!
- Guinea fowl.

01:48:58.309 --> 01:49:01.934
Now. as soon as night falls. dig it...

01:49:02.018 --> 01:49:03.393
- and spizziciamo. - Pinch.

01:49:03.476 --> 01:49:05.434
- See you tomorrow. - Yup.

01:49:05.518 --> 01:49:07.059
- Wait up. - Hi. Giangio.

01:49:07.143 --> 01:49:09.809
Take cover!  Take cover!

01:49:09.893 --> 01:49:14.059
Hi!  Hey. Pinocchio!  Do you remember?

01:49:14.893 --> 01:49:18.976
I am the Fox. your friend.
How nice to see you.

01:49:20.226 --> 01:49:22.476
I've been looking for you a lot.

01:49:22.601 --> 01:49:26.309
I wanted to tell you: do you
know who stole the coins?

01:49:26.392 --> 01:49:29.226
The Cat. that infamous. who died.

01:49:29.684 --> 01:49:33.267
I am your friend.
I came to look for you.

01:49:33.351 --> 01:49:36.517
I was so sorry that
you lost the coins.

01:49:36.601 --> 01:49:38.392
What are you doing here?

01:49:38.476 --> 01:49:40.351
- Work. - Works?

01:49:40.559 --> 01:49:44.351
- How beautiful! And earnings?
- Ten money a day.

01:49:44.434 --> 01:49:46.671
Ten money?  Per day?

01:49:46.961 --> 01:49:51.517
But sorry. but then...
I am your friend.

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:54.043
The Cat is gone. he is dead.

01:49:54.126 --> 01:49:59.014
We take the coins and plant them at the
field. Do you remember the seedlings?

01:49:59.096 --> 01:50:01.540
Don't fool me again.

01:50:01.623 --> 01:50:04.854
- No.
- Look who's behind you: the Cat.

01:50:05.434 --> 01:50:07.877
- Why did you go out?
- Why did you go out?

01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:09.700
No. he is the thief.

01:50:09.865 --> 01:50:12.309
I am your friend.  Pinocchio!

01:50:12.682 --> 01:50:14.339
- Why did you go out? - Ah!

01:50:14.422 --> 01:50:15.747
Goodbye forever.

01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:19.185
- No. I'm your friend!
- Goodbye forever.

01:50:19.392 --> 01:50:21.173
- Pinocchio! - Goodbye forever.

01:50:21.256 --> 01:50:22.871
You're wrong!

01:50:23.534 --> 01:50:27.883
- Why did you go out? Why? Why are you...
- Ah!

01:50:28.173 --> 01:50:31.486
- Why did you go out? Why did you go out?
- Ah!

01:50:31.569 --> 01:50:33.764
Pinocchio. you are wrong!

01:50:33.971 --> 01:50:37.119
- I'm sorry. I don't helmet anymore!
- Pinocchio!

01:50:38.238 --> 01:50:41.427
- Let's plant the coins!
- Goodbye. masks.

01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:43.622
Wait up!

01:51:45.585 --> 01:51:46.911
Pinocchio.

01:51:48.858 --> 01:51:50.307
Fairy.

01:51:57.017 --> 01:51:59.792
I knew you have a good heart

01:52:00.621 --> 01:52:04.307
and I forgive you all the
troubles you have done.

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:12.591
Be judicious and in the
future you will be happy.

01:53:35.388 --> 01:53:39.820
Dad!  I have become a child!

01:53:45.163 --> 01:53:48.684
Santa. I'm a kid!

01:53:49.885 --> 01:53:52.246
I'm a kid. dad!

01:53:54.441 --> 01:53:56.512
Dad!

01:54:00.985 --> 01:54:03.056
Dad!

01:54:03.843 --> 01:54:08.068
Dad! I have become a child!

01:54:13.245 --> 01:54:17.926
Dad! I became a child. dad!

01:54:19.499 --> 01:54:23.144
- Pinocchio? - Santa. I'm a kid!

01:54:24.428 --> 01:54:27.866
Santa. I'm a kid!

01:54:27.949 --> 01:54:30.690
Pinocchio!  Pinocchio!

01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:17.641
Who knows where this
dirt road takes you

01:55:17.713 --> 01:55:22.149
that seems to go and never go.

01:55:28.676 --> 01:55:33.869
Who knows if there is another one
waiting for you behind that curve

01:55:33.941 --> 01:55:37.222
And then another AND yet another

01:55:38.737 --> 01:55:42.451
But step by step
You keep walking

01:55:42.523 --> 01:55:47.860
Trying to figure out which
way the wind is blowing

01:55:47.932 --> 01:55:52.404
If it brings dark skies
OR the scent of the future

01:55:52.476 --> 01:55:55.181
If it brakes or pushes you

01:55:55.253 --> 01:55:58.354
If you pretend to be your friend

01:56:04.412 --> 01:56:09.317
Who knows if these fields AND
these houses and these pines

01:56:10.290 --> 01:56:14.185
That pass close and silent

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:20.279
They will still be
behind you as you walk

01:56:20.351 --> 01:56:24.715
And step by step you
leave them behind

01:56:24.787 --> 01:56:26.806
But you don't turn around

01:56:26.878 --> 01:56:29.943
Don't stop to check

01:56:30.016 --> 01:56:34.090
Blue puddles greet
you And you go

01:56:34.199 --> 01:56:38.995
The wind sweeps the sky That
splinters into a thousand pieces

01:56:39.067 --> 01:56:43.214
And you turn every curve
to find out where it goes

01:56:46.207 --> 01:56:50.282
And you enjoy going
And not looking back

01:56:50.354 --> 01:56:54.645
And you think step by step
that you don't want to stop

01:56:54.717 --> 01:56:59.117
And you know you will
never want to go back

01:56:59.225 --> 01:57:04.634
And you know you will
never want to arrive
