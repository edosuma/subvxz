00:19.470 --> 00:21.070
- That's your theory?
- Yeah.

00:21.340 --> 00:23.610
No, that's not...
I mean, that... That's crazy.

00:23.670 --> 00:26.080
- Just admit it to me, you wouldn't...
- I'm not...

00:26.140 --> 00:28.680
You won't have to go to court next month.
It'll be over.

00:28.780 --> 00:30.550
Come on, just tell me that I'm right.

00:31.180 --> 00:34.080
- Tell me that I'm right.
- You're... No. You're not right.

00:34.150 --> 00:36.350
Dylan, you asked me
if I'm doing everything I can

00:36.420 --> 00:38.220
to get you off, but are you?

00:38.790 --> 00:39.790
Fuck you, Peter.

00:40.060 --> 00:41.260
- Dylan, come on.
- Fuck you.

01:16.530 --> 01:17.530
A lot of stuff here.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.830
My God. I feel like I need my inhaler.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.700
We have to find anything
that could be related to this photo.

01:27.770 --> 01:29.710
Anything that has to do
with Mr. Rafferty.

01:30.440 --> 01:33.240
The picture I received
of Coach Rafferty's trashed office

01:33.310 --> 01:36.850
was a strong indication that someone
had a serious vendetta against Rafferty.

01:37.610 --> 01:38.480
So, our next step

01:38.550 --> 01:41.320
was digging through
Hanover High's teacher conduct files

01:41.420 --> 01:43.650
to find out exactly
what that vendetta was.

01:44.620 --> 01:47.690
After our meeting,
Vice Principal Keene assured me

01:47.760 --> 01:49.890
that the school
was updating the digital records

01:50.160 --> 01:53.460
of their teacher conduct files
to be compliant with state regulations.

01:53.730 --> 01:56.870
In the meantime,
we were allowed to access the hard copies.

01:59.800 --> 02:04.440
- There has to be something on Rafferty.
- Nurse Ravelli. Harassment complaint.

02:04.870 --> 02:09.250
Says she requested a student
to wear deodorant repeatedly.

02:09.310 --> 02:11.610
- Who was the complaint made by?
- It doesn't say.

02:11.680 --> 02:14.550
I think because they're all students
you can't use the names,

02:14.620 --> 02:17.850
but I can almost guarantee you
it was Dave Larsen.

02:18.220 --> 02:20.290
The files were
full of information.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.330
Most of it was unusable.
But some of it's interesting.

02:23.390 --> 02:24.260
Let's see. Maeda.

02:24.690 --> 02:25.930
Uh, Maeda.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.670
"Personal property violation.
Confiscated student's vape pen."

02:38.270 --> 02:39.410
Oh, Rafferty file.

02:42.810 --> 02:44.680
"Inappropriate conduct with a student."

02:46.550 --> 02:49.690
We don't know who filed the complaint.
Details are sparse.

02:50.490 --> 02:52.320
Just a vague description:

02:52.760 --> 02:54.760
"Inappropriate conduct with a student."

03:06.340 --> 03:08.600
So, someone files a complaint
against Rafferty

03:08.670 --> 03:10.610
for inappropriate conduct with a student.

03:12.940 --> 03:16.250
On March 10th,
someone trashes Rafferty's office,

03:16.310 --> 03:19.720
and writes on his whiteboard,
"Stick your dick somewhere else."

03:21.450 --> 03:25.220
Then, five days later,
someone draws a dick on Rafferty's car,

03:25.290 --> 03:26.990
and there's splatter on the balls,

03:27.420 --> 03:29.830
clear evidence that he
could've been targeted first.

03:30.830 --> 03:33.960
Splatter, trashed office,
and teacher complaint.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.530
I feel like
these are definitely connected.

03:37.530 --> 03:38.470
The question is how.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.270
Or by who.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.310
I can see someone from a rival school

03:43.370 --> 03:46.880
not liking Coach Rafferty,
but everyone here loves him.

03:47.510 --> 03:50.310
I don't see how anybody
would have a grudge with him. No.

03:50.380 --> 03:53.880
I mean...
No, he's about as cool as it gets.

03:53.950 --> 03:57.550
I'm not part of the football crowd,
so, uh, I don't really have an opinion.

03:58.350 --> 04:00.520
Besides me thinking he's kind of a douche.

04:00.590 --> 04:02.890
Do you know anything
about his office being trashed?

04:03.730 --> 04:04.590
No.

04:05.260 --> 04:07.260
But does this mean he boned a student?

04:08.560 --> 04:10.870
I mean, 'cause I would.

04:11.870 --> 04:15.540
Him, I mean. I would bone... Yeah. Um...

04:15.840 --> 04:18.570
- Uh, thanks for doing this.
- Are we done now?

04:18.640 --> 04:19.810
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.779
- Thanks. Yeah.
- So professional.

04:22.780 --> 04:24.910
- We try.
- What can I do for you boys?

04:25.750 --> 04:28.550
Hear you've been asking about me.
My ears have been burning.

04:28.850 --> 04:30.690
- Hi, coach.
- Abby.

04:31.990 --> 04:34.520
Sounds like
you're hearing all kinds of crazy rumors.

04:34.690 --> 04:36.460
- Bye, guys.
- Bye. Uh...

04:38.960 --> 04:41.760
Yeah, we've been...
Yeah, we've been hearing a few, but we...

04:42.800 --> 04:44.930
Don't worry, we're not giving in to them.
We like, uh...

04:45.000 --> 04:47.800
- We like facts, not rumors here.
- Mm-hm.

04:48.900 --> 04:51.870
Okay. What do you wanna know?

04:53.040 --> 04:55.480
Why does no one know
that your office was trashed?

04:57.050 --> 05:00.520
I cleaned it up...
and didn't wanna make a big deal about it.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.020
So, it has nothing to do with, uh, this?

05:07.660 --> 05:08.520
Or even this?

05:13.500 --> 05:14.430
All right, look.

05:15.730 --> 05:19.370
I can't speak to the vandalism.
I know as much about that as anyone else.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.870
These other two things,
sure, there's a connection,

05:21.940 --> 05:26.740
but... guys, this complaint
is being taken way out of context.

05:26.810 --> 05:29.680
There was no inappropriate conduct
with a student.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.820
I did have a relationship
with a student's mom.

05:34.780 --> 05:35.650
That's over now.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.990
So, that's
why your office was trashed?

05:39.390 --> 05:40.060
Yeah.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.020
Well, who did it?

05:42.760 --> 05:43.960
Guys.

05:44.890 --> 05:45.960
Guys, come on.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.600
That would be totally inappropriate for me
to say.

05:48.660 --> 05:50.400
But, Sam, you should ask her out.

05:51.430 --> 05:53.740
- Who?
- Gabi. Ask her out.

05:55.540 --> 05:58.810
- We're not really on speaking terms.
- Be assertive. Girls like that.

05:58.870 --> 06:02.750
All right. I'll see you boys later. Peter,
don't get yourself in trouble with this.

06:03.380 --> 06:05.650
- Thanks for stopping by.
- No problem.

06:10.990 --> 06:13.720
Mr. Rafferty
was dating a student's mom.

06:14.020 --> 06:16.590
That student trashed his office.

06:17.090 --> 06:19.560
So, if we can identify
which mom he was dating,

06:19.800 --> 06:21.760
we'll uncover our student vendetta.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.030
But pinning down the exact relationship
in question

06:25.100 --> 06:28.940
is actually harder than we thought,
with a serial dater like Kyle Rafferty.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.880
He's been rumored to have been
with PTA president Beth Schachter,

06:33.110 --> 06:36.010
the lady who prints spirit week T-shirts,
Amy Agbulos,

06:36.150 --> 06:38.510
the local news reporter, Carolyn Tran,

06:38.650 --> 06:41.150
and Tongue Ring Tanya
from the mall Applebee's.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.690
- He's all over the place.
- Coach respects moms.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.560
No one respects moms like Coach.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.530
I mean,
Coach respects moms at the homecoming.

06:50.030 --> 06:52.560
You know,
Coach respects moms at fundraisers.

06:52.930 --> 06:55.630
And, I mean,
these moms are, like, legit hot moms,

06:55.700 --> 06:59.070
not, like... old moms,
with, like, weird wrinkled necks,

06:59.130 --> 07:02.770
but, like... moms with,
like, regular necks, you know?

07:02.840 --> 07:04.670
So, it's common knowledge.

07:05.140 --> 07:07.810
Coach Rafferty and moms,
definitely a thing.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.950
But how to find the right mom?

07:10.580 --> 07:11.950
As you know, I've tasked myself

07:12.010 --> 07:14.720
with finding the hottest moms here
at Hanover High,

07:14.780 --> 07:16.620
and I've got something you might like.

07:16.850 --> 07:19.560
Bear with me.
If a list of Hanover hot moms

07:19.620 --> 07:21.590
seems dumb to you, you're not wrong.

07:21.890 --> 07:24.960
But Sam does
these mini-side investigations

07:25.030 --> 07:25.890
from time to time.

07:26.630 --> 07:28.860
They usually end up
on the cutting room floor.

07:28.930 --> 07:31.970
"Hanover's circumcised wieners."

07:32.030 --> 07:34.870
The most important one, though,
is Dylan Maxwell.

07:34.940 --> 07:37.070
Is he circumcised? I don't know.

07:37.170 --> 07:39.170
Do I wanna find out? Yes.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.780
But I'm including this one

07:40.980 --> 07:43.580
because it actually leads
to something useful.

07:43.650 --> 07:45.610
Starting with
number eight, Mrs. Riley,

07:45.810 --> 07:48.720
moving our way to number seven,
Ms. Wyland, Mrs. Wagner,

07:48.780 --> 07:51.090
- Mrs. Johnson, going to Mrs. Finn,
- Yeah, that one.

07:51.150 --> 07:53.090
- Mrs. Kapoor, Ms. Romito,
- Yeah.

07:53.160 --> 07:57.030
And finally, number one,
who's hot not only because she's hot

07:57.090 --> 08:00.830
but also because she's a strong,
independent, hardworking woman...

08:01.600 --> 08:04.700
and also your mother... Mrs. Maldonado.

08:05.930 --> 08:07.700
- Can I see that for a second?
- No.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.570
- Just let me see it.
- I feel like you're gonna hit me.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.840
- What you get for putting my mom on there.
- Stop.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.710
This list means nothing
without any context,

08:15.780 --> 08:17.080
but it'll be important later.

08:17.850 --> 08:21.520
Now, we're lucky that the complaint file
included Mr. Rafferty's middle name,

08:21.820 --> 08:24.920
because when we went to Facebook,
a search for "Kyle Rafferty"

08:24.990 --> 08:26.090
didn't reveal anything,

08:26.520 --> 08:28.760
but a search for Kyle Joseph did.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.830
So, I went through all
of his Facebook friends

08:31.890 --> 08:33.900
to see if any
of the hot moms would show up,

08:33.960 --> 08:35.230
and one actually did.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.270
Number six.

08:41.140 --> 08:44.570
You can see there's two halves
of the same image posted in early March.

08:45.170 --> 08:46.210
- So...
- Yeah.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.640
- And that's Mackenzie Wagner's mother.
- Yeah.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.180
And look,
hand around her and everything.

08:53.980 --> 08:55.650
They were totally dating.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.790
Can you believe this shit?

08:59.660 --> 09:01.790
But why wouldn't Mackenzie tell us this?

09:03.060 --> 09:03.930
Who knows?

09:05.790 --> 09:07.830
If Rafferty was dating Mrs. Wagner,

09:08.060 --> 09:10.970
I can see how Mackenzie
would trash his office in response.

09:11.930 --> 09:13.040
But 27 dicks?

09:13.870 --> 09:16.070
A hundred thousand dollars in damages?

09:16.970 --> 09:18.270
Doesn't that seem extreme?

09:19.170 --> 09:23.110
Well, when it comes to Mackenzie Wagner,
and anything to do with her parents,

09:23.680 --> 09:25.750
extreme response is kind of her thing.

09:27.320 --> 09:30.590
Mackenzie, Mackenzie Wagner.
I mean, you know her.

09:30.720 --> 09:35.360
She's a mess. But the thing about her
is she used to be really fucking smart.

09:36.060 --> 09:38.330
I used to cheat off her all the time.

09:38.730 --> 09:40.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:40.630 --> 09:42.200
I mean, then she...

09:43.300 --> 09:47.170
She went downhill. I mean,
her parents got divorced or some shit,

09:47.240 --> 09:49.340
and she just gave up on school.

09:49.940 --> 09:52.840
I mean,
this chick went from straight-A honor roll

09:52.910 --> 09:54.740
to not even filling out the tests.

09:55.010 --> 09:57.210
It was bullshit.
I had to cheat off Dan Chang,

09:57.280 --> 09:59.720
and he looks smart, but he fucking isn't.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.920
Mackenzie's parents divorced
when she was in eighth grade.

10:03.620 --> 10:06.150
Then she completely retreated from school
and her friends.

10:06.990 --> 10:08.160
So, where did she go?

10:08.990 --> 10:12.890
She started spending a lot of time gaming
on the live-stream site Twitch,

10:13.160 --> 10:14.860
a place where she excelled.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.330
She gained a following.

10:16.930 --> 10:20.040
People would watch her
consistently beat guys twice her age.

10:20.740 --> 10:21.400
She loved it.

10:22.070 --> 10:24.410
So, when the real world got too real
for Mackenzie,

10:24.910 --> 10:27.180
she found a new one on Twitch.

10:28.140 --> 10:30.880
- Mackenzie Wagner?
- Oh, yeah, she sucks.

10:31.150 --> 10:33.350
Yeah, all the Wayback Boys
say that, but could...?

10:33.420 --> 10:35.980
No, no, no.
They hate her because of Dylan.

10:36.790 --> 10:40.690
I know Mackenzie...
and she's a fucking psycho.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.820
Could you tell me why?

10:43.830 --> 10:45.090
'Cause she sucks, man.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.800
But sucks specifically how?

10:46.860 --> 10:50.000
Okay, in ninth grade,
we were in JV basketball,

10:50.230 --> 10:52.400
and her parents
were in the middle of a divorce.

10:53.140 --> 10:57.270
So, she started fouling out.
Like, taking down everybody.

10:57.710 --> 11:00.080
In this one game,
she fucking elbowed a girl

11:00.140 --> 11:01.210
right in the face.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.410
Started fucking blood everywhere,
you know?

11:05.380 --> 11:07.250
Yeah, she's a fucking psycho.

11:09.720 --> 11:10.420
Is Ganj right?

11:11.220 --> 11:15.090
Does drama with her parents
make Mackenzie go psycho?

11:15.920 --> 11:17.790
Remember Dylan talked about his breakup?

11:17.860 --> 11:21.200
- I posted a video on Instagram.
- How Mackenzie broke up with him

11:21.260 --> 11:23.400
for posting an Instagram of her
at Nana's party.

11:24.030 --> 11:27.870
He also said that, around that time,
she was on edge because of her parents.

11:27.940 --> 11:29.970
I mean,
Mac was going through some home shit.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.340
Like,
her parents are always kind of off and on.

11:33.410 --> 11:35.740
It's complicated,
but for a while it looked like

11:35.810 --> 11:38.880
they were gonna get back together,
so, she was all stoked about it.

11:39.150 --> 11:40.750
And then, like, her dad

11:40.820 --> 11:44.390
just kind of... up and bounced,
after some drama.

11:45.050 --> 11:47.820
It looked like her parents
were going to get back together.

11:48.060 --> 11:51.160
Then her dad up and bounced,
because of some drama.

11:51.990 --> 11:54.130
We now know that that drama has a name:

11:54.860 --> 11:57.000
Kyle Joseph Rafferty.

11:57.830 --> 12:00.940
Everyone close to Mackenzie
confirmed that problems with her parents

12:01.000 --> 12:02.870
always led to some extreme reaction.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.440
So, if Rafferty kept her parents
from getting back together,

12:06.980 --> 12:09.110
it would make sense
that she'd trash his office.

12:09.740 --> 12:11.180
But if Rafferty covered it up...

12:11.250 --> 12:14.520
I cleaned it up...
and didn't wanna make a big deal about it.

12:15.150 --> 12:16.450
Would she wanna hit him again?

12:17.290 --> 12:19.150
This time even harder?

12:20.290 --> 12:21.160
The...

12:21.990 --> 12:25.990
Mackenzie...

12:27.500 --> 12:29.000
theory.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.870
- All right. Motive.
- Motive.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.940
- The motive was revenge.
- Right.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.440
Rafferty stopped her parents
from getting back together.

12:36.510 --> 12:38.040
- Strong motive.
- Strong motive.

12:38.110 --> 12:40.140
- Next up, alibi.
- Her alibi.

12:44.310 --> 12:45.210
- Alibi.
- Home bored.

12:45.850 --> 12:47.520
Remember Mackenzie's
Instagram post?

12:47.980 --> 12:50.050
The one where she said "home bored"?

12:51.050 --> 12:53.820
Dylan thought that was an invitation
for him to come over.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.490
I always thought
that was a bit of a stretch.

12:57.830 --> 12:59.390
But do you know what does make sense?

13:00.230 --> 13:02.960
Mackenzie posting that picture
as an alibi,

13:03.300 --> 13:06.870
an attempt to prove that she was home
during the time of the vandalism.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.400
She could have taken that photo
at any time,

13:09.470 --> 13:11.270
and then just posted it wherever.

13:11.340 --> 13:14.240
And the caption "home bored,"
she may as well have written:

13:14.310 --> 13:16.380
- "I'm not out vandalizing something."
- Yeah.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.980
And she posted it at the same time
of the vandalism.

13:19.050 --> 13:20.920
So, Dylan went, but she wasn't there.

13:20.980 --> 13:22.980
She said she saw him, but she was lying.

13:23.050 --> 13:26.220
- Motive, alibi... um, access.
- Her access.

13:26.290 --> 13:29.190
In the Instagram boomerang video
that caused the breakup,

13:29.260 --> 13:31.360
we can see that she's shotgunning a beer.

13:32.060 --> 13:33.960
But those aren't Mackenzie's keys.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.600
That's Dylan's keychain,

13:36.160 --> 13:39.200
which includes
a distinct naked lady bottle opener,

13:39.470 --> 13:43.410
and, more importantly,
the key to the media server room.

13:43.470 --> 13:45.440
If she never gave
Dylan's keys back to him,

13:45.510 --> 13:47.210
she could get into the server room.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.280
She's more technologically savvy
than Dylan.

13:49.340 --> 13:51.380
- She could've deleted the footage.
- Right.

13:51.450 --> 13:54.320
She's on Twitch all the time,
so, she knows computers.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.380
Crazy.
I can't believe that we missed this.

13:56.450 --> 13:58.290
'Cause we've never been looking for it.

13:58.350 --> 14:00.320
Oh, yeah, and, uh, the can.

14:00.390 --> 14:03.090
This photo proves Mackenzie Wagner
was at Nana's party,

14:03.160 --> 14:05.930
which means she could have gotten the can
at any time.

14:05.990 --> 14:08.360
And she was in the backyard
between 12:30 and one,

14:08.430 --> 14:11.300
in the area where the can was stolen.

14:11.370 --> 14:12.900
Rafferty.

14:13.170 --> 14:14.270
Very strong motive.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.210
Alibi: Latergram. Weak alibi.

14:17.470 --> 14:19.940
Access: Dylan keys. Easy access.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.440
And she was at Nana's party,
so, could've took the can.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.180
Dylan didn't draw the dicks.

14:25.010 --> 14:26.110
It was Mackenzie Wagner.

14:35.160 --> 14:40.630
Do you know that... Mackenzie's mother
was dating Mr. Rafferty?

14:43.100 --> 14:44.070
- What?
- Yeah.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.970
- No, she wasn't dating Mr. Rafferty.
- Yeah, she was.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.270
So, do you think it's possible
that maybe she...?

14:50.340 --> 14:52.540
There's other things
she's not telling you?

14:52.610 --> 14:55.480
No. Dude, she tells me fucking everything.
She tells me shit

14:55.540 --> 14:59.080
she doesn't tell anyone else. Dude,
she tells me when she's on her period.

14:59.150 --> 15:02.980
And that's not even gross to me. It just...
That's just the way that shit works.

15:03.650 --> 15:07.220
So, you saw the Instagram photo,
and went to Mackenzie's house, correct?

15:07.520 --> 15:09.260
- Yeah.
- Right. Then you left back

15:09.320 --> 15:11.990
to do the Kiefer Sutherland call,
correct?

15:13.560 --> 15:17.100
Then you were accused of the dicks...
and you needed an alibi,

15:17.300 --> 15:19.970
so people would know
you didn't draw the dicks, correct?

15:20.440 --> 15:21.300
- Yeah.
- Right.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.470
So, Mackenzie gave you an alibi.

15:24.540 --> 15:26.610
She said, "I was with you at my house."

15:27.340 --> 15:29.010
- So...
- What are you trying to say?

15:29.510 --> 15:31.350
I think that Mackenzie drew the dicks.

15:32.550 --> 15:34.520
Wha...? You think Mackenzie drew the dicks?

15:34.580 --> 15:37.090
Yeah. I believe you were
at Mackenzie Wagner's house

15:37.150 --> 15:40.560
on the day of the vandalism at 2:09,
but I don't believe that she was there.

15:41.260 --> 15:43.630
- What?
- You got accused of the dicks, right?

15:43.690 --> 15:46.460
You need an alibi. She gave you one.
"We were at my house."

15:46.530 --> 15:49.660
It was a perfect alibi for you,
but it was a perfect alibi for her.

15:49.730 --> 15:52.370
Yeah, no, that's not...
I mean, that... That's crazy.

15:52.430 --> 15:54.570
- Just admit it to me, you wouldn't...
- I'm not...

15:54.640 --> 15:57.310
You won't have to go to court next month.
It'll be over.

15:57.370 --> 15:59.140
Come on, just tell me that I'm right.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.580
- Tell me that I'm right.
- You're... No. You're not right.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.080
Dylan,
you asked me if I'm doing everything I can

16:05.150 --> 16:06.650
to get you off, but are you?

16:07.320 --> 16:08.450
Fuck you, Peter.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.680
- Dylan, come on.
- Fuck you.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.490
Dylan, don't let her do this to you.

16:25.130 --> 16:27.470
Dude, Dylan is actually crazy.

16:28.170 --> 16:32.510
He's about to have to pay $100,000.
He's not gonna be able to go to college.

16:32.570 --> 16:34.780
He's about to ruin his entire life
for some girl.

16:35.380 --> 16:37.380
For some girl he thinks he's in love with.

16:37.450 --> 16:39.410
- No, that's not...
- It makes no sense to me.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.220
That's not what happened.
I keep coming back to this text:

16:42.280 --> 16:45.150
- "I'd do anything for you." Right?
- Yeah, I know. It's crazy.

16:45.220 --> 16:46.690
- He's so whipped...
- Just wait.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.590
"I'd do anything for you." Think about it.
Mackenzie is Dylan's alibi.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.030
Dylan is Mackenzie's alibi.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.270
They did it together.

17:04.270 --> 17:07.609
This wasn't the first time we'd
considered that this was a two-person job.

17:10.550 --> 17:13.380
But it was the first time
that it really made sense.

17:16.050 --> 17:18.650
And when you think about it,
it makes complete sense, okay?

17:18.720 --> 17:22.119
Think about the time per dick.
It was super tight for one person,

17:22.190 --> 17:25.530
- like, barely enough time for one person.
- But two, there's plenty of time

17:25.589 --> 17:29.360
- to have done everything. And that's...
- Also explains why the whiteboard dicks

17:29.430 --> 17:31.400
did not look like the parking lot dicks.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.300
- Mackenzie drew the dicks.
- Mackenzie was the dicks.

17:34.370 --> 17:36.500
- And Dylan was deleting the footage.
- Exactly.

17:36.570 --> 17:38.540
That's why he won't admit that she did it,

17:38.610 --> 17:40.240
- because they're both...
- Exactly.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.810
- So, he lied.
- So, he's just been fucking with us.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.320
He's been lying to us, yeah.

17:51.220 --> 17:52.250
Dylan Maxwell.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.690
I'm Dylan Maxwell,
and this is breadfacing.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.160
Mackenzie Wagner.

18:03.230 --> 18:04.100
Thank you.

18:04.570 --> 18:06.770
For months
I filled notebooks with their words...

18:07.740 --> 18:09.440
corkboards with their faces.

18:10.170 --> 18:14.380
I grew to believe what they told me,
but everyone has something to hide.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.810
People withhold information.

18:17.610 --> 18:18.580
People exaggerate.

18:19.610 --> 18:20.480
People lie.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.890
And when it's impossible
to trust anyone...

18:24.690 --> 18:28.420
you just have to go back to the facts,
and draw your own conclusion.

18:31.230 --> 18:34.300
Why are we even doing this?
Why go back?

18:34.360 --> 18:35.937
You know he's just gonna keep denying it.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.130
I just want him to know it's over.

18:58.820 --> 19:01.160
Hey, dude,
stop knocking on my door, all right?

19:01.220 --> 19:01.890
Where's Dylan?

19:02.520 --> 19:05.560
- He doesn't wanna see you.
- Where's Dylan? I need to speak to him.

19:05.630 --> 19:08.300
- I need to speak to him. Where's Dylan?
- He doesn't...

19:10.270 --> 19:10.930
Screw this.

19:26.510 --> 19:27.450
Hey, Dylan.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.490
So, that's it.
You're just gonna keep lying to me?

19:30.550 --> 19:32.850
After everything I've done,
you're gonna keep lying.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.390
I was on the honor roll before this.
I said "dick" to teachers for you.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.530
I got suspended for you.
You know that, right?

19:38.590 --> 19:40.900
- The fuck are you talking about?
- You're an asshole.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.730
- I'm an asshole?
- You're an asshole.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.870
- I'm an asshole? Just a guilty asshole.
- Yeah.

19:44.930 --> 19:47.200
You're not guilty
because you're an asshole.

19:47.340 --> 19:49.340
- You're guilty because you did it.
- Come on.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.840
You did the dicks with Mackenzie.

19:50.910 --> 19:54.980
It's ironic. I set out
to expose all the biases in the school.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.850
Biases that could have led
to the expulsion of an innocent student

19:58.910 --> 20:01.450
based on reputation instead of facts.

20:01.820 --> 20:03.820
But I got a little too close
to my subject.

20:04.450 --> 20:05.820
And I think you can see here...

20:05.890 --> 20:07.720
Do you know how hard I worked on this?

20:07.790 --> 20:10.960
Know how many hours I slaved over this,
trying to prove you innocent?

20:11.530 --> 20:14.230
I may have had some biases of my own.

20:44.990 --> 20:47.260
Really, Peter?
That's your theory?

20:47.600 --> 20:49.660
You creep on my Insta,

20:49.730 --> 20:52.400
and find some bullshit Latergram
from weeks ago,

20:52.470 --> 20:54.570
and, oh, that proves your point, right?

20:55.040 --> 20:57.370
- Fuck off.
- No, it's not just that.

20:57.810 --> 21:01.280
Yeah, your alibi sucks, and,
yeah, you had access because of Dylan,

21:01.680 --> 21:02.640
but it's the motive.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.410
You know Mr. Rafferty was the target.

21:05.950 --> 21:06.880
So what?

21:07.880 --> 21:10.490
Who has more of a reason
to hate Mr. Rafferty than you?

21:12.620 --> 21:14.390
He humiliated you by dating your mom.

21:15.720 --> 21:16.590
I didn't care.

21:17.830 --> 21:21.430
But you did... 'cause you thought
your parents were gonna get back together.

21:21.830 --> 21:24.070
- So, you filed a complaint against him.
- Not true.

21:24.330 --> 21:27.440
And the school did nothing
about it. They just marked it "resolved."

21:28.000 --> 21:29.470
So, you trashed his office...

21:30.940 --> 21:33.440
and he covered it up,
and no one ever knew about it.

21:33.980 --> 21:36.780
So, you took it a step further,
because that pissed you off.

21:37.510 --> 21:38.550
And you did the dicks.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.980
You did the dicks because he deserved it
for ruining your life.

21:50.490 --> 21:55.500
It's so easy for you to sit there
behind that stupid camera

21:55.560 --> 21:57.100
and make accusations about people...

21:57.870 --> 21:58.830
you don't even know.

22:00.840 --> 22:03.740
And look,
I am sorry if we ignored you before,

22:04.040 --> 22:05.770
but if this what you're really like,

22:05.840 --> 22:08.980
then I guess there's a reason
everyone thought you were such a loser.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.680
And now everyone's secrets are out,
throughout the entire school,

22:12.750 --> 22:14.950
all because of what? You what?

22:15.420 --> 22:17.350
You had to make the best movie?

22:18.820 --> 22:22.120
You know what?
When this is all over, so are you, okay?

22:22.420 --> 22:25.130
Because you are nobody,
and you're just mad about it.

22:26.460 --> 22:29.000
You know, walking away
is just as good as admitting guilt.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.970
Dude, you can't post this.
It's gonna fuck up my plans for college.

22:35.740 --> 22:38.470
You mean like it fucked up
Dylan's plans to go to college?

22:41.910 --> 22:42.780
You can't.

22:44.610 --> 22:45.480
I have to.

22:45.810 --> 22:46.950
I have to tell the truth.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.980
But if I'm wrong, then change my mind.

22:54.060 --> 22:54.920
I can't.

22:57.730 --> 22:59.160
Everyone has something to hide.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.930
People withhold information.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.130
People exaggerate.

23:05.800 --> 23:06.670
People lie.

23:07.940 --> 23:09.900
And when it's impossible
to trust anyone...

23:11.840 --> 23:16.410
you just have to go back to the facts,
and draw your own conclusion.

23:17.580 --> 23:20.820
But sometimes your conclusion is wrong.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.010
Dude, what the fuck?

24:04.460 --> 24:05.660
Who should we show this to?

24:14.070 --> 24:14.940
Everyone.
