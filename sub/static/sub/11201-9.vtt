WEBVTT

00:01.534 --> 00:04.128
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:04.237 --> 00:06.899
BRA'TAC: All you have to do
is prick him, once.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.337
The effect will be immediate.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.137
He'll believe you
to be his loyal slave, Jarren.

00:11.244 --> 00:13.337
Whoa! No violence.

00:13.446 --> 00:16.882
- Your name?
- Cam Mitchell. Bounty hunter.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.947
Don't worry about SG-1 and Earth.

00:24.457 --> 00:26.721
They are of little consequence.

00:34.267 --> 00:36.360
Approaching the coordinates now, sir.

00:36.469 --> 00:39.097
Drop us out of hyperspace.
Maximum shields.

00:45.245 --> 00:46.507
Colonel?

00:47.514 --> 00:49.482
We should have a visual.

00:51.951 --> 00:54.511
If the second supergate is here,
we should be able to see it.

00:54.621 --> 00:55.986
EMERSON: Anything on the sensors?

00:56.089 --> 00:59.581
There seems to be
a powerful gravitational field nearby.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.826
Supergates use black holes for power.

01:02.929 --> 01:05.989
Oh, this is not a black hole,
it's a neutron star,

01:06.099 --> 01:09.728
and the field is powerful enough
to weaken our shields and cause...

01:12.639 --> 01:13.867
Damage report!

01:13.973 --> 01:16.305
Reporting hull damage
on decks two and seven.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.969
Battle stations! Get us out of here, Major.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.740
Hyperdrive will not engage.

01:20.847 --> 01:22.405
Hull integrity has been compromised!

01:22.515 --> 01:25.382
- Who the hell is shooting at us?
- MARKS: I can't tell, sir.

01:25.552 --> 01:27.383
Detecting three ships.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.149
Ori?

01:29.255 --> 01:31.985
Based on size,
I'd say Goa'uld mother ships.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.821
Their shields should be weakened as well!

01:34.227 --> 01:37.060
Fire all forward rail guns. Arm missiles.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.888
Major, transfer auxiliary power
to sublight engines

01:39.999 --> 01:42.126
and set a course hard right.

01:50.877 --> 01:54.005
Sir, detecting multiple
small objects dead ahead.

01:55.081 --> 01:56.412
Oh, my God.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.086
It's a minefield.

02:01.187 --> 02:02.620
Full reverse thrust!

02:16.002 --> 02:17.560
Damage report!

02:19.339 --> 02:20.533
EMERSON: Marks!

02:27.914 --> 02:30.246
Emergency subspace communication
from the <i>Odyssey,</i> sir.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.647
Put it onscreen.

02:31.751 --> 02:34.413
<i>Stargate Command, this is</i>
<i>Colonel Paul Emerson of the</i> Odyssey,

02:34.521 --> 02:36.751
<i>authentication code, delta-six, alpha-five.</i>

02:36.856 --> 02:39.950
<i>We're under attack.</i>
<i>We've suffered extreme damage.</i>

02:40.360 --> 02:42.794
<i>Intel about the second supergate</i>
<i>was false.</i>

02:42.896 --> 02:45.456
<i>We've been ambushed</i>
<i>by as many as three Goa 'uld mother ships.</i>

02:45.565 --> 02:47.692
<i>We've lost hyperdrive, shields are down.</i>

02:47.800 --> 02:51.361
<i>Several decks without life support.</i>
<i>We're being boarded!</i>

02:54.641 --> 02:57.041
That's it, sir. That's all we got.

04:01.274 --> 04:04.266
We began receiving telemetry
from the emergency transponder

04:04.377 --> 04:07.676
approximately 30 minutes
after the distress call came in.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.145
Unfortunately, it doesn't tell us anything

04:09.249 --> 04:11.581
about the condition
of the ship or the crew.

04:11.684 --> 04:13.413
Sounds like it was badly damaged.

04:13.519 --> 04:15.646
Anything on who might
have been behind this?

04:15.755 --> 04:19.919
We were acting on what we thought
was reliable intel from the Jaffa.

04:20.893 --> 04:24.090
Bra'tac is investigating
the source of the false intel,

04:24.197 --> 04:26.927
but the Jaffa nation is in disarray
and many have reverted back

04:27.033 --> 04:28.933
to old warring factions.

04:29.035 --> 04:31.765
Tracing such betrayal
may prove virtually impossible.

04:31.871 --> 04:34.305
There must be a lot of Jaffa out there
who are pretty angry

04:34.407 --> 04:36.136
about the destruction of Dakara.

04:36.242 --> 04:37.732
The Ori were responsible for that.

04:37.844 --> 04:40.779
And there are more than a few
who think it was us who led them there.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.873
Angry enough to set up an ambush?
For what, revenge?

04:44.984 --> 04:46.815
Well, we have a signal.
Let's go check it out.

04:46.919 --> 04:49.319
Yeah, one tiny snag there.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.549
We have no vessels in which to travel.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.353
The <i>Daedalus</i> is on its way to Pegasus.

04:53.459 --> 04:56.485
And it will be days before a Jaffa ship
becomes available to us.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.791
Well, you only have to ask.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.058
You must know by now

05:00.166 --> 05:03.033
that I can get you
pretty much anything you want.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.967
Yeah, for a price.

05:05.071 --> 05:07.471
Nothing comes for free, Daniel.

05:07.573 --> 05:10.770
Of course, in this instance,
I would naturally waive my fee,

05:10.877 --> 05:13.471
but I will need some front money,
so to speak.

05:13.579 --> 05:14.876
Be careful.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.711
We still have no idea who's behind this.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.058
(CREW CHATTERING)

05:38.438 --> 05:41.635
Glad to see you're awake, Colonel.
How's your head?

05:41.741 --> 05:43.299
It's fine, sir.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.934
- What's our status?
- They towed us out of the minefield.

05:46.045 --> 05:49.481
Most of the crew is accounted for.
We're still missing three.

05:51.818 --> 05:54.685
Which one of you
is Colonel Samantha Carter?

05:55.088 --> 05:57.454
I'm Colonel Paul Emerson,
commander of this ship.

05:57.557 --> 06:00.048
If you have any questions, you ask...

06:00.159 --> 06:01.490
If any of you try to be heroes,

06:01.594 --> 06:03.494
I assure you
my commander will think nothing

06:03.596 --> 06:06.292
of venting this hold of all atmosphere.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.558
I will not ask again.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.860
I'm Carter.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.575
Bring her. Him, too.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.017
Colonel Carter,

06:34.193 --> 06:36.320
I had heard you were quite attractive.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.761
I'm Colonel Paul Emerson,
commander of this ship.

06:39.065 --> 06:42.159
- What do you want?
- Nothing you can do for me.

06:44.504 --> 06:47.200
Now, Colonel Carter, on the other hand...

06:48.074 --> 06:50.872
- Can I call you Samantha?
- No.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.978
You're Lucian Alliance.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.172
(CHUCKLES)

06:55.281 --> 06:56.873
The uniform.

06:56.983 --> 07:00.612
Pathetic, isn't it?
Pretending to be something we're not.

07:02.555 --> 07:07.891
Anateo is my name, and believe me,
I am part of no alliance of any kind.

07:10.229 --> 07:12.129
Now, we don't know much
about this ship yet,

07:12.231 --> 07:17.328
but we have found a subspace beacon
that is giving away our position.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.629
I need you to shut it off.

07:22.008 --> 07:26.206
- I'm not going to help you.
- I don't see what choice you have.

07:29.649 --> 07:34.279
You are going to do
whatever it is I want you to do.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.014
Don't do it, Sam.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.121
Oh, I suggest you should do it, Sam.

07:52.939 --> 07:57.501
It's not designed to be shut off.
It activates automatically and stays on.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.100
Then remove it.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.772
Don't help them, Colonel. That's an order.

08:10.156 --> 08:14.149
ANATEO: I believe that now makes you the
ranking officer on this ship, Colonel Carter.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.387
I suggest you get to work,

08:16.496 --> 08:19.829
unless there's something else
you'd rather do.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.435
Yeah, she's a real beauty.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.909
Stabilizers are a bit wonky, I'm afraid.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.810
Makes for a bumpy ride,
but it's all perfectly safe.

08:35.915 --> 08:36.939
Really?

08:37.116 --> 08:38.140
(CRASHING)

08:40.620 --> 08:42.178
Not exactly.

08:42.288 --> 08:44.256
We gave you as much raw naquadah
as you needed,

08:44.357 --> 08:46.951
and all you came up with
was this piece of junk?

08:47.059 --> 08:48.583
People's lives are at stake, Daniel.

08:48.694 --> 08:53.597
Do you honestly think that I cheaped out
on the ship and pocketed the difference?

08:53.699 --> 08:54.723
(ALARM SOUNDING)

08:54.834 --> 08:58.861
- What's that?
- Life support seems to be failing.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.434
Can you take over?

09:13.619 --> 09:16.053
Great, you fixed that.
How about fixing the stabilizers?

09:16.155 --> 09:19.215
I didn't fix anything,
I just disabled that annoying alarm.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.384
Our long-range sensors
indicate that the signal coming

09:21.494 --> 09:24.054
from the <i>Odyssey</i> transponder
is changing location.

09:24.163 --> 09:25.289
It's moving?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.798
TEAL'C: It appears to be traveling
at sublight speed.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.595
Altering course to intercept.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.131
- Are you cloaking?
- I am attempting to.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.767
It does not appear the cloak is responding.

09:51.057 --> 09:54.652
The signal now appears
to be originating from that planet.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.856
Sensors are picking up
numerous life signs.

09:57.964 --> 09:59.124
If life support were compromised,

09:59.231 --> 10:01.529
they could have landed the ship
for repairs.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.194
They are not responding to our hails.

10:05.404 --> 10:08.498
There appears to be a small civilization
on the surface.

10:09.241 --> 10:11.232
I knew I recognized this planet.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.110
More friends of yours?

10:13.212 --> 10:15.578
The Goa'uld used to have
a shipbuilding facility here.

10:15.681 --> 10:18.582
It's now been taken over
by the former human slaves.

10:18.684 --> 10:22.381
From what I know,
they have ties with the Lucian Alliance.

10:22.488 --> 10:24.388
You know, that doesn't sound too good.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.117
We talking chop shop here?

10:26.225 --> 10:27.283
I have a contact here.

10:27.393 --> 10:28.985
He might get skittish if we all show up,

10:29.095 --> 10:32.121
so it could be a good idea for me
to go in alone.

10:32.231 --> 10:34.756
You know, it could be a trap.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.495
All the more reason
why we shouldn't all go.

10:37.603 --> 10:40.037
Trust me, if he knows anything,
I'll be able to get it out of him,

10:40.139 --> 10:45.236
but the key is to be as inconspicuous
and as non-threatening as possible.

10:47.913 --> 10:49.881
If you like, I can take Daniel.

10:57.456 --> 11:01.483
Colonel, what happened?
You've been gone for hours.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.186
Where's Colonel Emerson?

11:10.703 --> 11:12.568
BORZIN: Vala Mal Doran.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.197
Never thought
you'd show your face in these parts again.

11:15.408 --> 11:18.707
Borzin, you slimy,
two-faced grease peddler.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.176
Come on, give us a hug.

11:22.281 --> 11:23.475
(GROANS)

11:23.749 --> 11:26.877
And what poor loser have you conned
into your company this time?

11:26.986 --> 11:29.045
Oh, this is my apprentice, Seamus.

11:29.755 --> 11:33.247
- You must be learning a great deal.
- More than I'd like to.

11:33.459 --> 11:37.225
Actually, I only took him on
as part of a bet. He's mentally disabled.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.761
<i>BORZIN: Don't trust her.</i>
<i>She will sell you out</i>

11:39.865 --> 11:41.833
<i>for a bad lunch the first chance she gets.</i>

11:41.934 --> 11:43.629
I know.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.899
He likes me. Isn't that cute?

11:47.006 --> 11:51.409
What do you want, Vala,
if you haven't already stolen it from me?

11:51.510 --> 11:53.569
We're looking for some information.

11:53.679 --> 11:55.704
About a Tau'ri ship that was attacked
not far from here.

11:55.815 --> 11:57.908
Any information you can give us...

11:58.017 --> 12:00.144
Okay, my friend,

12:02.054 --> 12:03.521
here's the thing.

12:03.622 --> 12:07.058
- He's not my apprentice. He's a mark.
- No!

12:07.159 --> 12:10.492
A very rich, very gullible one,
who's eating right out of my hands.

12:10.596 --> 12:11.824
Give us something, anything,

12:11.931 --> 12:14.092
and he'll make it
very much worth your while.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.135
- You know, I've heard that before.
- All right, try this.

12:17.236 --> 12:21.195
We traced the signal from
the ship's emergency transponder here.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.670
I know you can't possibly
have the whole ship,

12:23.776 --> 12:26.904
but I know you must have some parts.

12:28.280 --> 12:32.649
Borzin, I don't know what's going on,
but you're in way over your head.

12:32.985 --> 12:35.681
I've recently made some contacts
high up in the Lucian Alliance

12:35.788 --> 12:37.915
that'd be very interested
in knowing exactly

12:38.023 --> 12:40.491
how much you've been
skimming off this operation.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.552
Wow. Offers that can't be refused.

12:44.663 --> 12:45.960
Over here.

12:49.068 --> 12:52.037
While we're at it, why don't we get him
to throw in some parts for our cargo ship?

12:52.138 --> 12:53.935
One thing at a time.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.772
Is this what you're looking for?

12:58.210 --> 13:01.907
That's <i>Odyssey's</i> data recorder.
The transponder's still broadcasting.

13:02.014 --> 13:05.677
- Where did you get this?
- A man brought it a few hours ago.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.686
He said it could fetch me a very nice price.

LANDRY: You think they were
specifically after you?

14:19.458 --> 14:21.858
They knew
we would follow the transponder signal.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.155
Why?

14:23.262 --> 14:25.992
Perhaps they were trying to deter us
from trying to find the <i>Odyssey.</i>

14:26.098 --> 14:28.566
Personally, I think they just don't like us.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.500
Well, I can see
why they might not be your biggest fans.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.664
Well, whatever the reason, there was
no other way to retrieve this intel.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.468
The recording suggests
the <i>Odyssey</i> wasn't destroyed,

14:36.575 --> 14:39.203
but is in the hands of the Lucian Alliance.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.472
Unfortunately, that's all we got.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.946
Borzin disappeared
along with Daniel and Vala,

14:44.049 --> 14:46.643
and no one else
we talked to knew anything.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.743
Teal'c, spread the word among the Jaffa.

14:48.854 --> 14:52.984
Tell whoever will listen I want to talk
to the leader of the Lucian Alliance.

15:00.299 --> 15:04.360
I've always felt civilization
can be judged by two things,

15:04.470 --> 15:07.200
its food and its women.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.099
I'd say yours is only halfway there.

15:16.048 --> 15:20.452
I don't blame you,
but you have to keep up your strength.

15:20.452 --> 15:20.713
I don't blame you,
but you have to keep up your strength.

15:22.621 --> 15:24.589
You have a whole ship to fix.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.056
You know,
that could take the rest of my life.

15:27.159 --> 15:32.187
Whether that is long or painfully short
is up to you.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.566
Daniel, Vala.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.138
- Hi, Sam!
- We thought you'd miss us.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.297
Where are the others?

15:44.109 --> 15:46.509
Listen, there is
that small matter of my fee.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.739
Oh, of course.

15:48.847 --> 15:51.543
Half payment for half of SG-1.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.413
Two-fifths, actually.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.320
- It's a small quibble, but...
- Don't help.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.950
Look, it is not my fault
that only two of them showed up.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.159
Of course.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.591
Take care of him.

16:10.102 --> 16:14.436
Look, I... I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'll be seeing you again, so...

16:15.441 --> 16:16.499
(BORZIN GIGGLES)

16:16.608 --> 16:18.405
No, I think not.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.478
Put them in the hold.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.614
Don't worry, Sam. It's all part of the plan.

16:32.191 --> 16:34.716
Each division of Lucian Alliance territory
is controlled

16:34.827 --> 16:38.024
by one of Netan's lieutenants,
or "seconds," as they're called.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.860
There are about 20 such individuals
overseeing operations

16:40.966 --> 16:43.434
including smuggling,
extortion, racketeering,

16:43.535 --> 16:45.196
and of course, trafficking in Kassa.

16:45.304 --> 16:48.364
Is there anything new coming?
Because this feels like a rerun to me.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.066
Well, we've been following up on rumors

16:50.175 --> 16:52.507
of betrayal and possible mutiny
among the seconds.

16:52.611 --> 16:55.478
There seems to be mounting dissent
over Netan's leadership.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.981
Well, that's good, but how does it help us?

16:58.083 --> 17:01.314
Kefflin, one of Netan's most loyal
and trusted seconds.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.354
He oversees
a large Kassa production operation

17:03.455 --> 17:06.219
on a remote group of planets
on the outskirts of the galaxy.

17:06.325 --> 17:07.758
LANDRY: What about him?

17:08.660 --> 17:11.254
Besides the fact that he's a brutal killer
with a notorious temper...

17:11.363 --> 17:13.092
We only know of him by reputation, sir.

17:13.198 --> 17:16.725
He's extremely reclusive, and rarely,
if ever, leaves his command ship.

17:16.835 --> 17:20.202
Very few, if any, of Netan's inner circle
have ever met the guy.

17:20.305 --> 17:23.297
You think this Kefflin is behind
the disappearance of the <i>Odyssey?</i>

17:23.409 --> 17:26.742
No, sir. I think
he's the perfect candidate to impersonate.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.877
Excuse me?

17:31.383 --> 17:34.944
I am suggesting
that I infiltrate the Lucian Alliance.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.654
It's the only way we're gonna get
reliable information on the <i>Odyssey.</i>

17:37.756 --> 17:39.485
You don't even have
a decent picture of the man.

17:39.591 --> 17:42.424
That's what makes him
the perfect candidate, sir.

17:43.629 --> 17:44.994
Reole chemical.

17:45.097 --> 17:48.692
Dr. Jackson used it a few years back
to infiltrate a System Lord summit.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.361
One jab of that,
and Netan will believe I am who I say I am

17:51.470 --> 17:52.869
regardless of what I look like.

17:52.971 --> 17:56.099
No one else will question me
because no one else has ever seen him.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.641
So you think.

17:59.978 --> 18:02.503
I'm not saying it isn't risky, sir.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.607
I'm saying we have to do something.

18:12.191 --> 18:13.283
How are you holding up?

18:13.392 --> 18:15.758
I'm working as slowly as I can,
but I can't keep it up forever.

18:15.861 --> 18:17.920
Do you have any idea what they're
planning on doing with the ship?

18:18.030 --> 18:20.555
- Or us, for that matter?
- No, but without the transponder,

18:20.666 --> 18:23.032
Stargate Command
doesn't have a hope in hell of finding us.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.535
Our only chance is to take this ship back.

18:25.637 --> 18:28.401
Well, I have an idea about that,
but it's pretty risky.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.441
Well, it's probably better than our plan.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.409
- Well, what's your plan?
- We don't have one.

18:41.653 --> 18:42.813
(ALARM SOUNDING)

18:44.590 --> 18:48.048
They have detected us, Colonel Mitchell.
Are you prepared?

18:48.160 --> 18:50.185
Prepared as I'll ever be.

18:52.564 --> 18:53.826
<i>State your business.</i>

18:53.932 --> 18:56.560
I'm Kefflin. I'm here to see Netan.

18:57.269 --> 19:00.898
- You are not expected.
<i>- I don't have to be expected.</i>

19:01.006 --> 19:02.997
<i>Authorize me for immediate transport,</i>

19:03.108 --> 19:05.736
<i>or I'll have your head</i>
<i>as an ornament for my ship.</i>

19:05.844 --> 19:08.335
I will notify Netan of your arrival.

19:13.619 --> 19:16.281
- Where is Netan?
- I will take you to him.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.953
Fine. Let's go.

19:19.057 --> 19:21.617
First, you must submit to a search.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.522
I don't think so.

19:24.963 --> 19:26.055
(GRUNTS)

19:27.666 --> 19:28.758
(GRUNTS)

19:31.336 --> 19:33.395
I asked not to be disturbed.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.838
I apologize, Netan,
but there has been an incident.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.944
(GROANS)

19:49.054 --> 19:51.454
I tried to tell them who I was,

19:51.557 --> 19:55.994
but apparently, the name "Kefflin"
didn't seem to mean much around here.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.687
Sorry about that.

19:59.798 --> 20:03.859
The ring was a gift
from my latest conquest.

20:10.842 --> 20:14.073
My dear friend Kefflin is here,
and you didn't inform me?

20:14.179 --> 20:18.047
I'm sorry, Master.
You asked not to be disturbed.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.013
So, you beat him instead?

20:20.118 --> 20:23.781
As you can see,
the beating wasn't entirely one way.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.152
(NETAN LAUGHS)

20:26.458 --> 20:28.187
I'm sure it wasn't.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.793
Leave us.

20:37.703 --> 20:38.795
What?

20:40.339 --> 20:43.467
It is not too late
to turn this ship over to Netan.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.175
You would be a hero.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.245
You know I can't do that.

20:48.614 --> 20:51.276
Netan has failed the Alliance,

20:51.383 --> 20:55.012
and his position as leader
hangs precariously by a thread.

20:56.355 --> 20:59.222
He knows
I am his most worthy challenger,

20:59.324 --> 21:03.192
but he could not very well
just murder me in cold blood,

21:03.295 --> 21:05.456
so he sent us on a fool's quest.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.658
- But we succeeded.
- Yes,

21:09.835 --> 21:13.066
and this is going to ensure
the downfall of Netan.

21:14.573 --> 21:18.134
But why was it necessary
to also bait a trap to capture SG-1?

21:18.243 --> 21:21.701
Because everyone knows
that they have caused us more grief

21:21.813 --> 21:24.714
than any other adversary,
including the Ori.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.942
All the seconds, including me,
have begged Netan to go after them,

21:29.054 --> 21:30.749
but he refused.

21:30.856 --> 21:32.346
He's a coward,

21:32.457 --> 21:36.689
choosing to run and hide
rather than face the wrath of the Tau'ri.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.160
Will we not?

21:38.830 --> 21:41.196
We have brought their battleship
to its knees.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.791
What are they going to do?

21:43.902 --> 21:49.067
After I present <i>Odyssey</i> and SG-1
to the others,

21:49.708 --> 21:53.576
Netan's stuffed corpse
will be a trophy on my wall,

21:54.746 --> 21:58.341
and control of the Lucian Alliance
will be mine.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.117
It's been a disappointing season,
my friend.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.720
Drought and floods have ravaged
our highest-yielding Kassa plantations,

22:09.261 --> 22:11.729
the armies of the Ori continue
to usurp the planets

22:11.830 --> 22:13.798
upon which we've established trade,

22:15.267 --> 22:17.667
- and, of course, there's the Tau'ri.
- Yes.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.764
Committing our ships to co-operate
in the fight against the Ori incursion

22:21.873 --> 22:23.807
was a strategic mistake.

22:28.046 --> 22:30.947
You've always appreciated
my honesty in the past.

22:33.652 --> 22:34.880
I have.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.550
You're the boss.

22:37.789 --> 22:40.451
I don't blame you, but others do.

Word reached me you just captured it.
I wanted to know your plans.

23:03.982 --> 23:06.542
Its beaming and hyperspace technology

- The usual channels.

23:12.023 --> 23:15.356
I heard rumor that the <i>Odyssey</i>
was destroyed in battle with the Ori.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.025
Nothing has been confirmed yet.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.860
I certainly had nothing to do with it.

23:20.966 --> 23:24.458
Netan, a ship has been detected
in proximity.

If you don't mind, I'm going to need
some time alone with him.

All right, we have to find a way
to get you out of here.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.396
Have you found the location
of the <i>Odyssey?</i>

25:34.499 --> 25:37.093
Not yet. I don't think Netan knows
where it is either,

25:37.335 --> 25:39.667
and he's definitely having some trouble
with his seconds.

25:39.771 --> 25:43.207

- No, Teal'c, and not at your expense, no.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.477
The Tau'ri are in possession
of an audio recording,

27:03.588 --> 27:05.988
which indicates that he's in control of it.

27:12.530 --> 27:14.930
I ordered the attack on the <i>Odyssey.</i>

that he eliminate you, Karug,

27:56.574 --> 27:58.474
take over your planets.

28:00.645 --> 28:03.341
Anateo hasn't just captured the <i>Odyssey.</i>

28:03.581 --> 28:06.049
He's using it to bait a trap for SG-1.

28:06.151 --> 28:10.019
He has lost his mind.
The Tau'ri will declare all-out war on us.

28:10.922 --> 28:13.789
You should have consulted with us, Netan.

29:17.222 --> 29:18.814
For the time being.

29:19.357 --> 29:22.520
You'll need someone
to supervise Gavos' territory.

29:25.697 --> 29:27.665
Your cut will be 20%.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.372
- Come on!
- I'm working as fast as I can...

29:36.474 --> 29:39.204
- You stole the <i>Prometheus</i> all by yourself.
- I know, the systems are all new.

29:39.310 --> 29:41.244
You said you could do it.
We do not exactly have a lot of time.

29:41.346 --> 29:43.507
No. Sam warned us that a number
of the arrays have been damaged.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.015
Even with locators,
beaming a person from one room

29:46.117 --> 29:47.948
to another within the ship is very risky.

29:48.052 --> 29:51.215
Do you want them to rematerialize
between the decks?

29:52.323 --> 29:54.587
<i>(ON RADIO) Teresh, this is Anateo.</i>

29:54.926 --> 29:57.394
<i>You missed your check-in. Report.</i>

30:01.766 --> 30:03.256
Move!

30:03.701 --> 30:05.503
Where are they? Dr. Jackson and Vala!

30:05.503 --> 30:06.902
Where are they? Dr. Jackson and Vala!

30:13.678 --> 30:16.112
Anateo, we've got a problem.

30:24.722 --> 30:26.883
Dr. Jackson, Vala.

30:28.259 --> 30:29.692
<i>(ON INTERCOM)</i>
<i>Just wanted to let you know</i>

30:29.794 --> 30:31.659
<i>that your duplicity has already forfeited</i>

30:31.763 --> 30:33.458
<i>Colonel Carter's life.</i>

30:33.798 --> 30:36.995
<i>Unless you surrender immediately,</i>
<i>the rest of the crew is next.</i>

30:44.609 --> 30:47.669
- I can't be sure.
- Do it anyway.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.413
No one else is going to fix this ship.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.384
I think it's pretty clear
that you've just been stalling,

30:55.920 --> 30:59.219
and that you're not really going to
fix it for me anyway.

31:00.425 --> 31:03.519
I'm just going to have to figure it out
for myself.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.466
Good enough.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.335
Where is she?

31:19.811 --> 31:22.041
Well, I couldn't be sure,
so I just beamed out the only other

31:22.146 --> 31:23.443
life sign in the room instead.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.277
Okay, where is he?

31:31.656 --> 31:33.817
Well, Sam did say it was risky.

31:43.201 --> 31:45.396
When she's right, she's right.

31:53.711 --> 31:56.475
Only 50% of the shield emitters
are responding.

31:56.648 --> 31:59.014
Okay, we need to get them back online
and get the hull integrity back

31:59.117 --> 32:00.414
within acceptable parameters.

32:00.518 --> 32:02.110
Hyperdrive is our priority.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.848
Well, we think most of Anateo's men
have been accounted for.

32:04.956 --> 32:06.446
- Most?
- Yeah, we swept the ship twice,

32:06.557 --> 32:08.650
rounded up 14 men in total, but not Solek.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.955
Vala had to beam him out of the hold
where the crew was being held,

32:11.062 --> 32:12.927
so we have no way of knowing for sure
where he ended up.

32:13.031 --> 32:14.430
Did you check the sewage reservoir?

32:14.532 --> 32:16.625
Yeah, no life signs. How's it going here?

32:16.734 --> 32:19.498
Well, no shields, no weapons,
no communications,

32:19.604 --> 32:22.334
and at least a day out for hyperdrive.

32:22.874 --> 32:24.705
So, we're sitting ducks.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.644
Kefflin, what are you doing?

32:31.082 --> 32:33.482
Interrogating the prisoner further.

32:34.986 --> 32:37.011
And what have you learned?

32:37.755 --> 32:39.382
Not much yet.

32:41.025 --> 32:43.585
Fine. Then we can kill him together.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.492
- Kill him?
- We've learned all we can.

32:48.866 --> 32:51.334
Anateo has left us no choice.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.636
I am committed to sending
a message to the Tau'ri.

32:55.006 --> 32:57.338
Netan, I have to admit,

32:57.775 --> 33:00.335
I was just beginning to enjoy this one.

33:04.349 --> 33:06.715
I'm sorry, my old friend.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.479
Your fun is over.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.516
VASHIN: Netan!

33:13.891 --> 33:15.756
The <i>Odyssey</i> has been found.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.762
Tenat, welcome.

33:28.406 --> 33:30.601
This is my good friend, Kefflin.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.404
It is my pleasure.

33:36.614 --> 33:39.242
I have heard a great deal
about you, Kefflin.

33:39.684 --> 33:40.981
Yeah, likewise.

33:42.420 --> 33:46.789
Tell me what you have learned, Tenat,
and perhaps I will spare your pathetic life.

33:47.291 --> 33:49.020
(LAUGHS) Funny as always, Netan.

33:49.894 --> 33:53.125
As you suspected,
the <i>Odyssey</i> was never destroyed.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.557
Anateo betrayed you
and kept it for himself.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.061
- Where is it?
- Half a day's journey, maybe less.

34:00.304 --> 34:03.068
I have transmitted the coordinates
to your bridge.

34:03.441 --> 34:06.069
- Get to your ship. We'll travel together.
- Of course.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.475
Wait just a moment,

34:10.882 --> 34:12.474
Cam Mitchell.

34:18.089 --> 34:19.818
Look, I don't know who you think I am...

34:20.091 --> 34:22.685
You are Cam Mitchell, bounty hunter.

34:23.294 --> 34:25.956
You double-crossed me
and my partner, Jup.

34:33.738 --> 34:34.966
What do you want?

34:35.073 --> 34:38.565
I do not know how you've managed
to convince Netan that you are Kefflin,

34:38.676 --> 34:41.167
but you are obviously
up to something big here.

34:41.846 --> 34:43.040
I will take half.

34:43.648 --> 34:45.582
And what about your loyalty to Netan?

34:45.683 --> 34:49.278
He would kill me the instant
I am no longer of use to him.

34:50.221 --> 34:52.212
And Jup, your old partner, where's he?

34:52.323 --> 34:56.692
He is working elsewhere at the moment.
We need not worry about cutting him in.

34:56.794 --> 34:58.159
Fine, 10%.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.559
It'll be big, trust me.

35:00.064 --> 35:03.591
30%, or I tell Netan you are not
who you say you are.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.827
25%, no more.

35:06.537 --> 35:08.937
I'll ring over to your ship
before this one jumps to hyperspace

35:09.040 --> 35:11.270
and fill you in on the details.

35:16.881 --> 35:19.577
Unchain the prisoner.
He's coming with me.

35:37.268 --> 35:38.326
(GRUNTS)

35:38.436 --> 35:40.199
Teal'c! Teal'c!

35:42.173 --> 35:43.265
(GRUNTS)

35:44.175 --> 35:46.871
I have grown weary of this torture,
Colonel Mitchell.

35:47.211 --> 35:52.672
That's pretty obvious,
but right now, we got to go.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.328
You remember Tenat?

36:08.432 --> 36:10.297
Yeah, as in Jup and Tenat.

36:10.601 --> 36:13.331
Well, he somehow weaseled his way
into commanding an Alliance mother ship,

36:13.437 --> 36:17.567
and check this out, the incompetent twit
actually found the <i>Odyssey.</i>

36:18.643 --> 36:19.632
Did he see you?

36:19.744 --> 36:22.144
Yeah, recognized me as well,
but he's keeping his mouth shut

36:22.246 --> 36:25.682
'cause he figures I'm scamming Netan
and he wants a piece of the action.

36:25.783 --> 36:28.616
We have to get over to his ship
before this one jumps to hyperspace.

36:28.719 --> 36:30.152
What is your plan?

36:31.255 --> 36:33.189
I'm making it up as I go along.

36:39.330 --> 36:43.494
- Tenat. Netan is here to see you.
- What?

36:46.537 --> 36:47.765
Netan.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.340
- I know of your intention to deceive me.
- Well, how did you...

36:50.441 --> 36:53.604
I knew Colonel Mitchell was
impersonating Kefflin all along.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.008
Colonel Mitchell?

36:55.146 --> 36:56.613
Of SG-1.

36:57.114 --> 36:59.378
I caught him and Teal'c
trying to leave my ship.

36:59.584 --> 37:01.779
No, Netan, you are mistaken.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.845
It's true, I knew he wasn't Kefflin,

37:04.956 --> 37:10.326
but I was merely trying to lure him here,
so I could turn him over to you.

37:11.095 --> 37:14.189
That is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard!

37:14.865 --> 37:17.561
Please, don't kill me.

37:19.537 --> 37:22.267
Get up, you pathetic excuse for a...

37:23.174 --> 37:24.141
Whatever you are.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.268
- What are you going to do to me?
- Nothing for the moment.

37:27.378 --> 37:28.902
Oh, thank you.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.640
You are a generous and gracious man.

37:31.816 --> 37:34.546
I say that all the time, don't I, men?

37:34.652 --> 37:37.120
Tell him how honored you are
to finally meet him in person...

37:37.221 --> 37:39.086
Shut up. Stop sniveling.

37:39.557 --> 37:40.922
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

37:46.063 --> 37:47.291
Dr. Jackson.

37:51.235 --> 37:54.932
If these sensors are working properly,
two Goa'uld mother ships just emerged

37:55.039 --> 37:57.030
from hyperspace and are closing in.

38:13.357 --> 38:15.052
- Sam?
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

38:15.159 --> 38:18.322
We may need that hyperdrive
a little ahead of schedule.

38:18.429 --> 38:19.862
How ahead of schedule?

38:19.964 --> 38:22.432
<i>In about 10 seconds would be good.</i>
<i>We've got company.</i>

38:22.667 --> 38:24.726
We need more time. Can you stall?

38:25.102 --> 38:28.230
We're about to find out.
What's our shield status?

38:28.339 --> 38:30.705
- Less than 30%.
- Weapons?

38:30.808 --> 38:33.641
Rail guns are online,
but we don't have missiles yet.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.374
One of the ships is hailing us.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.377
(CLEARS THROAT)

38:41.552 --> 38:42.951
On screen.

38:45.623 --> 38:46.590
<i>Dr. Jackson.</i>

38:46.691 --> 38:50.024
Oh, right. Hi. Hi, how are you?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.356
<i>I was expecting Anateo.</i>

38:52.463 --> 38:56.229
Yes, he was here for a while,
but then he had to go.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.631
<i>Your ship is battered.</i>

38:57.735 --> 38:59.760
<i>My scans tell me your</i>
<i>shield strength is low,</i>

38:59.870 --> 39:02.532
<i>and if you had hyperdrive,</i>
<i>you would have left long ago.</i>

39:02.640 --> 39:05.131
<i>Surrender now, or be destroyed.</i>

39:05.810 --> 39:08.438
Right. Okey-dokey.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.548
We surrender.

39:12.049 --> 39:14.040
<i>- Prepare to be boarded.</i>
- Yeah, see, that's where

39:14.151 --> 39:15.311
you're going to run into a bit of a problem.

39:15.419 --> 39:19.412
You see, our rings are damaged,
and as you yourself pointed out,

39:19.523 --> 39:22.686
our shields are down,
which means atmosphere in the 302 bays

39:22.793 --> 39:24.385
is unsustainable.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.225
(STUTTERS) I mean, I just don't see how
we're going to get your guys over here,

39:28.332 --> 39:31.631
unless you want me to try
beaming you over?

39:36.273 --> 39:38.434
They're powering weapons.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.741
Sam, I think I've stalled as long as I can.

39:41.512 --> 39:44.447
- We need more time.
<i>- Too late.</i>

39:46.250 --> 39:49.185
You should probably prepare to return fire.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.280
For the record, I'm always prepared.

39:53.657 --> 39:55.750
I just have to press this button here.

39:57.128 --> 39:59.562
Right. I just... I thought that's what you're
supposed to say, so I...

39:59.663 --> 40:00.994
I know.

40:01.966 --> 40:03.763
Open fire on the other Ha'tak vessel.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.392
- What?
- You heard me.

40:05.503 --> 40:08.631
- But...
- You dare question my tactics?

40:08.739 --> 40:11.230
There's a ship full of traitors out there
waiting to unseat me as leader

40:11.342 --> 40:12.309
of the Lucian Alliance.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.877
Fire now!

40:14.145 --> 40:17.672
You shall be richly rewarded
with vast territories to command.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.646
Fire on the other Ha'tak vessel.

40:29.293 --> 40:31.761
One of the mother ships is firing
at the other.

40:32.062 --> 40:33.996
Receiving radio signal.

40:34.331 --> 40:36.959
(ON RADIO) Odyssey,

40:47.144 --> 40:48.133
Yeah.

Locking on their locator beacons.

40:50.714 --> 40:52.705
<i>What are you doing?</i>

40:52.983 --> 40:54.780
Netan? What?

40:55.052 --> 40:56.144
TENAT: How?

40:56.887 --> 40:59.014
I thought this was Netan.

41:08.799 --> 41:12.132
Jackson, what are you doing sitting there?

41:12.269 --> 41:15.898
- What are you wearing?
- It's a long story.

41:16.006 --> 41:18.975
<i>You are the biggest fool in two galaxies!</i>

41:19.610 --> 41:22.170
But Netan, I...

41:23.714 --> 41:25.443
I screwed up.

41:28.385 --> 41:30.979
It's the wrong one. You can't just jam it in.

41:34.825 --> 41:37.191
- How did you do that?
- Honestly, I don't know.

41:37.294 --> 41:39.660
That almost never normally works.

41:40.731 --> 41:42.255
Daniel, try it now.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.566
(EXPLOSION)

41:49.807 --> 41:52.298
Shield failure is imminent.

41:53.744 --> 41:56.770
Damn you, Cam Mitchell.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.960
You know, you're very lucky that no one
else on the bridge of that ship

42:12.062 --> 42:13.359
knew what Netan looked like.

42:13.497 --> 42:16.330
Yeah, it was a gamble,
but I figured if I got made,

42:16.433 --> 42:19.630
or if the chemical jab on Tenat didn't work
after half an hour,

42:19.737 --> 42:21.728
I'd take the bridge by force.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.365
I had a pissed-off Jaffa
waiting to help me out.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.107
- Where's Teal'c?
- Oh, he's in the infirmary.

42:29.246 --> 42:31.441
Yeah, big boy got banged up a bit.

42:31.916 --> 42:33.645
Hey, what happened?
How did you get the Lucian Alliance

42:33.751 --> 42:34.740
to fire on each other?

42:34.852 --> 42:36.183
Oh, you'll love this.

42:36.620 --> 42:39.646
Before you tell us, I got long-range
communications back online,

42:39.757 --> 42:42.487
and sent a message to Earth
telling them that we'll be coming home.

42:42.593 --> 42:45.790
Yeah. You should probably add
that we have officially declared war

42:45.896 --> 42:47.591
on the Lucian Alliance.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.667
I did.
