You know, landfill
Mong kok is in my custody.

02:45.855 --> 02:48.067
This piece of shit is ratting me out

02:48.102 --> 02:50.586
bringing Police around my establishment!

02:50.621 --> 02:53.070

Everyone in Yau Ma Tei know...

02:55.780 --> 02:57.540

02:57.575 --> 03:00.250
...To my markets...

03:00.460 --> 03:04.250

does not understand the rules.

...Caused some trouble here!

03:07.960 --> 03:09.550
Pong!

03:11.720 --> 03:12.670

03:12.680 --> 03:15.600
If you piss me off I'll cut off your balls.

03:15.635 --> 03:16.960
Well, Zi Long...

03:16.970 --> 03:18.850
You're already down three...

03:18.885 --> 03:20.695
But you still do not know.

03:20.730 --> 03:25.520
If you lose at the end of this round
don't blame me!

03:32.070 --> 03:33.440
- Eight rounds.
- Pong!

03:33.450 --> 03:36.575
I don't know how much you can afford Chow..

03:36.610 --> 03:39.700
I will drop the last card now. Trust me...

03:39.735 --> 03:42.000
They will die because you lost.

03:42.710 --> 03:43.860
A Long,...

03:43.870 --> 03:46.080
...No matter whoever wins
between the three of us...

03:46.115 --> 03:48.290
We're still going to execute
these little cocksuckers...

03:48.960 --> 03:51.670
Okay, let's see who's the lucky one.
You?

03:51.705 --> 03:54.130
Him?

03:58.810 --> 04:00.170
...Or yellow hair?

04:00.180 --> 04:03.100
You want to call your boss the top dog?

04:04.120 --> 04:05.985
Well, finally...

04:06.020 --> 04:07.850
Eight round!

04:07.860 --> 04:09.860
Nine rounds!

04:12.109 --> 04:15.110
I got something for that ass!

04:15.145 --> 04:16.704

04:16.740 --> 04:19.490
I know you're some cheating bastards!
But I still won!

04:19.524 --> 04:21.490
Let go of my nigga!

04:27.250 --> 04:28.750
Release them.

04:30.710 --> 04:31.990
Sorry, I have a date.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.695
And not with you,
Peace out...

04:34.730 --> 04:37.390
Thank you, Brother Long.

04:39.260 --> 04:41.185
Goddammit!

04:41.220 --> 04:43.220
You don't belong in these streets!

04:43.255 --> 04:45.220
Get to the fucking hospital!

04:51.820 --> 04:53.820
SPECIAL ID

04:57.480 --> 05:00.020
Wait, I didn't say you could go yet.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.900
Another asswhipping huh?

05:07.110 --> 05:11.040
Zilong! You can go
once you beat me.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.880
Come on!

06:08.680 --> 06:11.300
Oh you wanna battle?

06:15.270 --> 06:17.940
You okay?

06:26.360 --> 06:28.070
Get up!

06:29.320 --> 06:33.135
- Get up!
- Get up!

06:33.170 --> 06:36.950
Come on!
Come on!

06:36.985 --> 06:37.990
Get up!

06:38.000 --> 06:40.170
Dammit!

08:13.550 --> 08:16.220
Brother Bou!

08:22.600 --> 08:24.400
Open the door!

08:28.400 --> 08:31.320
Kick his ass!

08:38.330 --> 08:41.750
- Stop that motherfucker!
- Do not let him get away!

08:47.210 --> 08:48.280
<i>Catch him!</i>

08:48.290 --> 08:50.290
<i>Don't run pussy!</i>

08:54.760 --> 08:58.260
Hey Jay!
Kim Mao...

08:58.295 --> 09:00.260
Fast! Get up.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.720
Run!

09:08.730 --> 09:11.360
Don't sit here.
Go!

09:11.570 --> 09:13.285
- Go..
- They...

09:13.320 --> 09:15.535
Yes, please take them to the hospital!

09:15.570 --> 09:17.820
Yes, do not worry.
Wait for me at the usual place.

09:20.870 --> 09:23.290
I'm too old for this shit...

09:43.180 --> 09:45.100
Take this money and go see a doctor.

09:45.135 --> 09:47.100
I don't need your money!

09:48.230 --> 09:50.110
I don't need to pay any more debts.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.980
Normally you're never late...

09:54.015 --> 09:56.673
...But we're on some new shit today huh?

09:56.780 --> 09:58.150
I was stuck in traffic!

09:58.160 --> 10:00.785
I was doing my best.

10:00.820 --> 10:03.240
And why do I need to save
your ass all the time?

10:03.275 --> 10:05.637
You cannot imagine how much
danger I was in today!

10:05.672 --> 10:08.000
Why do you always put
your lives in so much danger?

10:08.420 --> 10:09.795
Saving my people!

10:09.830 --> 10:11.385
To save that fucking goofball?

10:11.420 --> 10:13.095
Are you that desperate for a laugh?

10:13.130 --> 10:16.760
They are people too dipshit.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.685
Zi Long, you do not forget...

10:20.720 --> 10:22.720
...I asked you to investigate a gang.

10:22.755 --> 10:24.737
And do it very low-key..

10:24.772 --> 10:26.685
Not start a street war.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.190
I got stuck.
I couldn't help you!

10:28.225 --> 10:29.550
You got stuck, is that it?

10:29.560 --> 10:31.400
All of these gangsters
fighting to be number one..

10:31.435 --> 10:33.730
they create their own problems.

10:34.355 --> 10:37.600
I'm a big brother I must help them.

10:37.610 --> 10:39.610
You're their big brother?

10:39.645 --> 10:41.627
You cannot take responsibility for them!

10:41.662 --> 10:43.610
You're a policeman!

11:07.850 --> 11:13.850
Happy birthday to you...

11:19.820 --> 11:22.865
...Kak Amy!

11:22.900 --> 11:29.410
Happy birthday to you!

11:29.445 --> 11:32.170
Thank you!

11:37.090 --> 11:38.880
Twerk it ma!

11:58.530 --> 12:00.705
I've been ok.

12:00.740 --> 12:03.410
Do my children take after me?

12:03.660 --> 12:06.700
Well, brother Xiong did not listen to mom.

12:07.530 --> 12:10.410
That's what I worry about
when I'm not around.

12:10.445 --> 12:12.460
I need someone to take care of you.

12:18.210 --> 12:19.630
Ma.

12:21.550 --> 12:24.680
Why don't we retire together...

12:24.715 --> 12:27.565
...We can go to the beach bar every day?

12:27.600 --> 12:30.100
It would be good if we
could retire together.

12:30.310 --> 12:32.195
But I understand...

12:32.230 --> 12:35.690
Zi Long, you cannot continue
to follow the road you're on.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.430
Ma...

12:47.200 --> 12:49.620
Do you know what I am?

12:51.580 --> 12:53.540
Of course mom knows.

12:53.790 --> 12:56.040
I know my son well.

12:56.790 --> 12:58.190
Like any mother should..

12:58.710 --> 13:01.090
We don't get to spend
a lot of time together.

13:01.125 --> 13:03.337
...But I understand you.

13:03.372 --> 13:05.515
Mom know that your
heart's in the right place.

13:05.550 --> 13:08.725
You're a cop.
Of course I knew.

13:08.760 --> 13:12.640
Mother already knows that
you are the police.

13:13.390 --> 13:16.100
I know what you're doing.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.245
Why didn't you say anything?

13:22.280 --> 13:25.200
Everyone has their choices,
you'll figure it all out.

13:25.490 --> 13:27.870
Do you understand?

13:28.450 --> 13:32.245
For your mother is always with you.

13:32.280 --> 13:36.040
Actually I do have to protect you.

13:43.710 --> 13:47.360
<i>Give this case to Brother Kun.</i>

13:47.395 --> 13:51.010
I know him, he's scary..

13:51.045 --> 13:53.640
Brother Kun? He can't do nothing.

13:53.675 --> 13:55.010
I know him.

13:55.020 --> 13:56.735
I've known him a long time.

13:56.770 --> 13:58.770
- I can take care of him.
- He's here.

14:00.980 --> 14:02.380
Did you shit your pants?

14:04.360 --> 14:07.245
Out, you bastards!

14:07.280 --> 14:09.325
Why did you drive this way?

14:09.360 --> 14:12.700
Why did you take the scenic route asshole.
The highway was faster!

14:12.735 --> 14:15.215
My fucking hemorrhoids are on fire!

14:15.250 --> 14:17.710
Ten thousand dollar shoes and it's worth it
to beat the shit out of you with them!

14:17.745 --> 14:19.675
Fucktard!

14:19.710 --> 14:21.710
Go get my goddamn shoes back!

14:23.300 --> 14:24.925
Yo, Terry.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.515
Brother Kun.

14:26.550 --> 14:27.975
Police are on my dick..

14:28.010 --> 14:29.800
So sorry, I have to
invite you here.

14:29.835 --> 14:30.920
Where is Sunny?

14:30.930 --> 14:34.600
Sunny is in the car, he got the bubble guts.

14:34.635 --> 14:36.537
Yo, Sunny.

14:36.572 --> 14:38.405
No problem.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.470
All is well if you got the goods.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.060
I just need the money.

14:41.095 --> 14:44.360
Do you have it?

14:44.395 --> 14:45.760
Here.

14:50.970 --> 14:53.990
That's impossible.
He said the money was there!

14:54.025 --> 14:55.360
Lying sack of shit!

14:55.370 --> 14:56.870
Fucking newspaper!

14:56.905 --> 14:58.870
I didn't do it!

14:59.620 --> 15:03.000
Sunny! Sunny! Help me!

15:04.090 --> 15:05.670
Cheat me?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.970
I'll bury you alive!

15:09.005 --> 15:10.370
Sunny!

15:13.300 --> 15:14.700
Come on!

15:17.060 --> 15:18.695
Fuck you, Sunny!

15:18.730 --> 15:20.130
- Chill.
- You dare?

15:31.780 --> 15:34.085
Bastard!
I'm your brother!

15:34.120 --> 15:36.330
Family don't cheat each other!

15:36.365 --> 15:38.005
Fuck the rules!

15:38.040 --> 15:41.460
You think I'm afraid?
Fuck you!

15:41.495 --> 15:43.460
I'll kick your ass!

15:48.130 --> 15:51.550
Stop!
No more!

15:53.090 --> 15:55.230
Brother Sunny! Just spare me.

15:55.268 --> 15:57.619
...You can take everything I do not care.

15:57.722 --> 15:59.565
If Brother Cheng knows, you
are going to start some serious shit.

15:59.600 --> 15:59.960
You threaten me?

16:00.770 --> 16:01.970
If Chang knows you ambushed us!

16:01.980 --> 16:03.900
Well, tell him!

16:04.480 --> 16:06.440
He'll fix your ass.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.745
I kill you!

16:12.780 --> 16:14.180
You threaten me?

16:15.280 --> 16:16.950
You wanna tell the Boss?

16:16.985 --> 16:18.950
Let me finish him!

16:18.985 --> 16:20.660
Fine then...

16:20.695 --> 16:23.045
Bash his brains out of his ears..

16:23.080 --> 16:25.920
Be careful not to hit me, okay?

16:28.960 --> 16:30.710
Chop chop!

16:32.840 --> 16:34.260
Pussy...

16:37.800 --> 16:41.600
No witnesses, you understand?

16:44.730 --> 16:47.025
Sunny, I won't tell.

16:47.060 --> 16:50.400
You know me...
I highly appreciate your friendship.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.295
- Brother Lung!
- A Long.

17:00.330 --> 17:02.775
Why did you cut the hair?

17:02.810 --> 17:05.220
I got a new swag.

17:06.579 --> 17:08.300
A Long.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.930
Mom?

17:10.940 --> 17:15.980
Brother Xiong says I need a haircut.

17:16.015 --> 17:17.980
Please, sit.

17:19.420 --> 17:22.300
I'm an arteest..

17:22.940 --> 17:27.540
So I hold the scissors but often
I hold the gun or a knife.

17:28.180 --> 17:31.700
Brother Xiong, let's discuss this...

17:31.735 --> 17:33.065
This has nothing to do with her.

17:33.100 --> 17:36.625
Ma, you don't need a haircut.

17:36.660 --> 17:40.420
Do not worry I'll just get a trim.

17:40.455 --> 17:42.397
Yes, just a trim.

17:42.432 --> 17:44.340
Relax, please.

17:44.660 --> 17:47.340
I can't trust anyone.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.357
I believe in myself.

17:49.392 --> 17:51.305
So I cut my own hair.

17:51.340 --> 17:54.180
This time is special
I came here for a haircut mother.

17:54.215 --> 17:55.820
The scissors are sharp,
so I may mistakenly cut you.

17:55.855 --> 17:57.785
I'm not a barber.

17:57.820 --> 18:02.460
How can you hurt your brother who is
older than you when playing mahjong?

18:02.495 --> 18:04.900
They were all in cahoots trying to cheat me!

18:04.935 --> 18:06.545
One of my boys is in a coma.

18:06.580 --> 18:09.040
If I did not fight them,
I'd be in the hospital too!

18:09.075 --> 18:11.500
Your sidekicks brought problems with them..

18:11.740 --> 18:13.980
And the brothers came
to me to ask a solution.

18:14.015 --> 18:15.585
I have to know the facts.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.825
An internal feud may
occur among individuals in our gang.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.580
Fortunately there is another way out
that can make us more united.

18:21.020 --> 18:24.940
If we continue to fight,
surely the police will win.

18:25.380 --> 18:27.300
You've raised too many problems.

18:27.335 --> 18:28.705
You're a traitor.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.740
Brother Xiong believe it or not,..

18:30.775 --> 18:32.825
...All I do is for our betterment.

18:32.860 --> 18:37.305
For years I tried
to be your right hand.

18:37.340 --> 18:39.100
He always fought for you
and faced many dangers.

18:39.135 --> 18:41.057
Do not blame all of this on me!

18:41.092 --> 18:42.980
Chill out! It's just a haircut!

18:43.015 --> 18:44.330
Shut up!

18:44.340 --> 18:46.340
You're making my hands slip!

18:48.540 --> 18:50.020
Okay, cut straight.

19:03.140 --> 19:04.580
Beautiful, is it not?

19:09.700 --> 19:12.180
- Mom, let's go it is already late.
- Thanks.

19:12.620 --> 19:15.660
- See you, brother Xiong!
- A Long.

19:17.900 --> 19:21.540
I will reveal that you are a traitor.

19:21.575 --> 19:24.740
It's as simple as a haircut.

19:28.660 --> 19:30.745
Just kidding.

19:30.780 --> 19:33.300
We'll drink tea tomorrow morning..

19:33.980 --> 19:36.220
You almost made me shit a Toyota!

19:49.060 --> 19:51.705
Wassup dawg?

19:51.740 --> 19:53.940
Thanks for the paper.

19:53.975 --> 19:56.140
Brother Xiong, is everything ok?

20:02.340 --> 20:04.945
I met a guy
named Sunny in America.

20:04.980 --> 20:08.120
And I planned to
introduce him to Brother Kun...

20:08.155 --> 20:11.260
...But now I'm sure he's
stolen from me.

20:11.295 --> 20:13.260
He is your former subordinate.

20:15.580 --> 20:18.780
Go check him.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.620
Six years ago.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.820
I didn't pick your pocket!
What's your problem?

20:39.680 --> 20:42.690
Closer to the wall! Be careful!

20:42.725 --> 20:45.700
Right!
Fight smart!

20:45.735 --> 20:48.945
Lower the head!
Yes.

20:48.980 --> 20:51.300
Asshole! This is not your concern! Shut up!

20:51.335 --> 20:53.197
Three on one?

20:53.232 --> 20:55.060
You niggas are awesometacular.

21:29.020 --> 21:33.340
Put ice on your head, if not
your shit is gonna blow up like a balloon

21:40.940 --> 21:42.340
Okay.

21:53.460 --> 21:56.060
I want my badge back.

21:56.340 --> 21:59.140
You're not the police,
you're only pretending!

21:59.175 --> 22:02.180
You're a good informant.

22:02.215 --> 22:03.820
You did not know?

22:03.855 --> 22:05.260
I quit.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.170
Why?

22:07.180 --> 22:08.760
You do well with this why stop?

22:08.795 --> 22:10.305
I can't find someone else to replace you

22:10.340 --> 22:12.340
My boss already started to suspect me.

22:12.375 --> 22:14.340
I'm afraid I'm not capable
of overcoming them.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.340
I do not want my mother involved.

22:16.580 --> 22:19.625
I got it but I'm already involved.

22:19.660 --> 22:21.580
That means I have to replace
you if you quit.

22:21.615 --> 22:22.890
I will retire soon.

22:22.900 --> 22:25.825
Go to hell with your retirement!

22:25.860 --> 22:28.780
You get the credit and
leave my ass in the wind?

22:28.815 --> 22:31.900
I have to clean up all your messes!

22:31.935 --> 22:33.900
I’m the only one covering your ass!

22:34.140 --> 22:37.300
You want to stop?
Okay no problem.

22:37.335 --> 22:40.460
- I'll erase your entries
- Fine!

22:40.495 --> 22:41.610
Chen Zilong!

22:41.620 --> 22:45.980
Help me one last time
and I'll put you back on the squad.

22:52.980 --> 22:57.180
There is something going on
within the syndicate.

22:57.215 --> 22:58.490
And now we have the suspect identified.

22:58.500 --> 23:02.100
He may have been involved in
the assassination of brother Kun.

23:02.460 --> 23:04.025
Continue.

23:04.060 --> 23:05.945
The suspect is named Luo Zhiwei.

23:05.980 --> 23:07.700
He was one of your boys,
his nickname is Sunny.

23:07.735 --> 23:09.100
That is your target.

23:09.340 --> 23:11.980
The boss asked me to investigate him.

23:12.015 --> 23:13.290
Ironic huh?

23:13.300 --> 23:14.410
That's Good.

23:14.420 --> 23:15.450
Try to finish the task as soon as possible.

23:15.460 --> 23:18.860
Then we will have the evidence to
bust the whole organization.

23:18.895 --> 23:21.820
Then your mission is complete.

23:29.420 --> 23:32.700
You must have me re-instated
as soon as I finish this case.

23:32.735 --> 23:34.345
If not I will beat sparks out of your ass.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.665
I swear on my balls.

23:36.700 --> 23:40.345
Zilong, you still must go
back to China.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.380
Do not worry, Chinese
police will cooperate with you.

23:43.415 --> 23:46.380
- So watch your behavior.
- What exactly is this situation?

23:46.580 --> 23:49.160
Are you the only one who knows my identity?

23:49.195 --> 23:51.740
Now you ask me to work
with the Chinese police?

23:51.775 --> 23:53.345
Bitch I'm a thug!

23:53.380 --> 23:56.300
How do I work?
With an identity no one else knows about?

23:57.020 --> 23:59.060
Special identity.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.840
What do you mean?

24:03.875 --> 24:05.780
Think about it!

24:05.815 --> 24:07.780
Right.

24:10.060 --> 24:12.860
Nanhai

25:16.500 --> 25:19.360
- What do you want?
- Don't you want to be friends?

25:19.395 --> 25:22.220
You're crazy! Why would I
want a friend like you?

25:22.255 --> 25:23.940
You were following me.

25:23.975 --> 25:25.825
You want revenge?

25:25.860 --> 25:27.340
Oh you're so beautiful when you're angry..

25:27.375 --> 25:29.980
Let’s be friends.
What is your name?

25:30.015 --> 25:31.290
Bastard..

25:31.300 --> 25:33.820
Of course, I know you Jing Fang.

25:33.855 --> 25:35.820
You think I'm stupid?

25:36.460 --> 25:38.465
If you're trying to fuck go get a room!

25:38.500 --> 25:41.540
Your mother didn't teach you any manners?

25:41.575 --> 25:43.505
Test tube baby...

25:43.540 --> 25:46.060
Oh you know my momma huh?

25:46.095 --> 25:48.540
Are you my daddy?

25:49.740 --> 25:52.500
We about to go on Maury?

25:52.535 --> 25:54.797
Can I drive your nice car dad?

25:54.832 --> 25:57.060
After I stick my foot dead up your ass?

25:57.380 --> 25:59.380
walk you like a house shoe?

25:59.415 --> 26:01.345
Let’s make sure you make it to the hospital.

26:01.380 --> 26:03.345
There is a problem with your tires.

26:03.380 --> 26:05.060
- You need to get your goofy ass out of here.
- Leave him alone!

26:05.095 --> 26:06.250
Go.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.940
Chen Zilong, you always do that?

26:08.975 --> 26:10.940
What is your problem?

26:10.975 --> 26:12.940
Get in my car.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.780
Nigga hungry than a muthafucka..

26:35.420 --> 26:37.660
Hello Kitty.

26:37.940 --> 26:39.170
Cut it out.

26:39.180 --> 26:42.305
Apparently I know this girl.
We never met before?

26:42.340 --> 26:46.420
- I'm your contact.
- My new friend's name is Fang Jing.

26:47.180 --> 26:48.410
I like that, Fang Jing.

26:48.420 --> 26:51.100
Why are you so stupid.
This is a list of suspects.

26:51.340 --> 26:54.620
No need. I remember in my head.

27:01.780 --> 27:05.420
I'm warning you,
I will throw you out of my car!

27:08.180 --> 27:10.580
This is personal.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.220
Yes, ma'am.

27:20.140 --> 27:22.465
<i>He was very, very polite.</i>

27:22.500 --> 27:25.180
<i>I have to report it to his superiors.</i>

27:31.940 --> 27:33.340
Make yourself comfortable.

27:35.740 --> 27:37.825
You'll be staying here.

27:37.860 --> 27:41.140
If necessary,
this will be our temporary office

27:42.140 --> 27:45.940
So we work from home.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.780
Where's the restaurant?
The Laundromat?

27:49.815 --> 27:53.097
Mr. Chen, let me explain.

27:53.132 --> 27:56.380
You are here to work with us.
Understand?

27:56.415 --> 27:58.380
Understood.

27:58.700 --> 28:01.100
We have company?

28:02.620 --> 28:04.940
Just my superior.

28:05.500 --> 28:06.940
Captain.

28:09.420 --> 28:12.145
This is Captain Lei.

28:12.180 --> 28:14.660
I'm Chen Zi Long, thank you for your help.

28:14.695 --> 28:17.265
What's up? Nice to meet you.

28:17.300 --> 28:20.380
- I'll guarantee your safety.
- I appreciate it

28:20.980 --> 28:25.545
Luo Zhi Wei, infamous in
Chinatown America.

28:25.580 --> 28:29.140
Two years ago, he and his nephew
came back to China to do business.

28:29.175 --> 28:32.860
Most of them live in China,
but have no criminal record.

28:32.895 --> 28:37.345
But, they may be involved
in a murder...

28:37.380 --> 28:40.020
...Kun's brother and nephew blackmailed
some millionaires in Hong Kong.

28:41.460 --> 28:43.300
Luo Zhi Wei.

28:43.580 --> 28:45.820
Sunny, he is one of my old subordinates..

28:46.260 --> 28:49.680
You surely know, we're family.

28:49.715 --> 28:53.100
But we never re-connected,
since he left for the U.S..

28:53.260 --> 28:55.705
Why he left you...

28:55.740 --> 28:57.740
...And continued to commit crimes?

28:57.775 --> 28:59.740
Hush your mouth, okay?

29:00.020 --> 29:04.100
Zi Long, what is your plan?

29:04.500 --> 29:08.900
Easy, I'll invite
him to dinner and chat.

29:09.220 --> 29:10.900
Then?

29:11.180 --> 29:13.280
Fuck if I know.

29:13.315 --> 29:15.345
I'll wing it.

29:15.380 --> 29:18.100
I will continue to report
the information if any.

29:18.135 --> 29:19.410
What kind of plan is this?

29:19.420 --> 29:22.260
It's normal, relax.

29:22.295 --> 29:24.305
How cute, dinner.

29:24.340 --> 29:27.020
You don't know what the fuck
you're going to do, do you?

29:27.055 --> 29:29.020
What the fuck do you suggest?

29:29.380 --> 29:33.020
Captain, I think we need SWAT
to intervene in this operation...

29:33.055 --> 29:35.020
...To avoid any mishaps?

29:35.055 --> 29:36.090
Now you supervise me.

29:36.100 --> 29:38.980
I told you, I just do
what I think is right, okay?

29:40.380 --> 29:42.980
- How long have you been a cop?
- Eight years.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.340
I mean undercover.

29:45.375 --> 29:48.100
It's not the same anymore.

29:58.820 --> 30:00.220
I get it.

30:01.460 --> 30:04.185
I'll do my own thing.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.820
And I don't want to hear
any more of this shit.

30:07.020 --> 30:09.040
- Zi Long
- Love, peace and hair grease.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.060
Great attitude to take.

31:03.740 --> 31:05.140
Welcome.

31:05.980 --> 31:07.380
Move.

31:12.780 --> 31:15.540
Friends, the place was already booked.

31:15.575 --> 31:18.300
What's the problem?
Don't you miss me?

31:18.500 --> 31:20.460
What's wrong with you?

31:20.495 --> 31:22.385
You know this one place?

31:22.420 --> 31:25.745
We are both so different here.

31:25.780 --> 31:29.020
You pay for what you eat,
and I do not have to do that.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.860
Brother I ask you to not have any money!

31:30.895 --> 31:32.860
What's wrong with you?

31:36.100 --> 31:38.180
I go, okay?

31:49.540 --> 31:51.420
Brother!

31:55.300 --> 31:56.865
- Sunny!
- Brother Sunny!

31:56.900 --> 31:59.900
- My nigga Sunny!
- Nigga you dun got old.

32:06.140 --> 32:08.420
Brother Cheng.

32:08.700 --> 32:10.185
And this is...

32:10.220 --> 32:13.785
...Big mouth! Abang Long!

32:13.820 --> 32:16.140
That shit fits him.

32:20.140 --> 32:22.265
My master! Teacher!

32:22.300 --> 32:24.300
Don't exaggerate, we're friends.

32:24.335 --> 32:27.140
Applause for Brother Long.

32:27.540 --> 32:29.180
He's taught me a lot.

32:29.380 --> 32:31.380
And he was the greatest.

32:32.460 --> 32:36.340
Good, Abang Long looks for a worthy fighter!

32:37.260 --> 32:39.860
Although he is now old and fat.

32:42.020 --> 32:43.420
True?

32:45.140 --> 32:48.420
You know, I'm still practicing.

33:26.460 --> 33:28.900
Don't turn your back.
You will be attacked!

33:28.935 --> 33:30.540
I told you...

33:31.460 --> 33:33.980
But nigga I'm hungry
Let's grub!

33:39.740 --> 33:43.220
I almost just choked.

33:57.300 --> 34:00.180
Brother Xiong sent you here, right?

34:02.540 --> 34:04.420
You can ask whatever you want.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.580
Well, I say...

34:10.460 --> 34:12.980
Did you have to steal brother?

34:13.014 --> 34:14.980
Please answer me straight.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.820
You never give me the benefit of the doubt.

34:20.380 --> 34:22.340
You always listen to him.

34:38.580 --> 34:40.219
I don't want to ruin the joyous mood.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.219
We'll talk again.

34:51.420 --> 34:53.340
He's my teacher.

34:54.580 --> 34:55.810
Come.

34:55.820 --> 34:57.340
Let's drink together.

34:58.780 --> 35:01.460
What's the point in drinking a little?

35:01.495 --> 35:03.145
Drink the whole damn pot!

35:03.180 --> 35:04.945
Yes, that's right.

35:04.980 --> 35:08.020
Drink the whole damn pot!

35:08.700 --> 35:10.420
Fo Sho.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.540
You know, I like it hot!

35:43.620 --> 35:45.020
Hits the spot!

35:53.020 --> 35:54.420
I gotta take a leak.

36:04.900 --> 36:07.260
- Do not think want to run away.
- Shut up.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.540
Don't talk so much.

36:14.340 --> 36:17.420
Brother Cheng!

36:57.220 --> 36:59.620
You! Get him!

36:59.655 --> 37:01.100
Get him!

37:48.620 --> 37:50.020
Fuck!

37:57.020 --> 37:58.420
Faster!

37:58.940 --> 38:01.140
Come on!

38:10.460 --> 38:11.610
There.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.060
You there.

38:23.620 --> 38:25.020
Fast.

39:34.180 --> 39:35.900
Motherfucker!

39:37.620 --> 39:39.020
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you!

39:39.420 --> 39:41.020
Get out here.

39:41.860 --> 39:43.380
Come out if you dare!

40:28.420 --> 40:31.460
Stop the car!

40:32.620 --> 40:34.020
Come back!

40:39.020 --> 40:41.420
- Bastard!
- Get out of the car!

40:41.455 --> 40:43.420
Stop the car!

41:01.740 --> 41:03.620
Fast!

41:05.540 --> 41:07.820
Kick his ass!

41:10.180 --> 41:11.860
Stop!

41:14.540 --> 41:15.940
Wait!

41:17.140 --> 41:18.820
Fight me.

41:19.380 --> 41:20.820
Come here.

41:21.620 --> 41:23.180
Enter.

41:26.900 --> 41:29.380
Come on.

41:29.780 --> 41:31.180
Come here.

41:35.620 --> 41:38.220
- Come here.
- Coward!

41:39.660 --> 41:42.100
Really? The boss
sent you to kill me?

41:42.580 --> 41:44.065
True?

41:44.100 --> 41:47.220
- He ordered you to kill me!
- Bullshit!

41:47.255 --> 41:48.945
Listen to me.

41:48.980 --> 41:50.505
He wanted to kill me.

41:50.540 --> 41:51.730
I also want to know who
is behind all of this.

41:51.740 --> 41:54.620
You just follow orders!
Why?

41:54.655 --> 41:57.060
Why?
Tell me!

42:02.740 --> 42:04.180
Stop!

42:06.420 --> 42:09.420
Do not get involved.
Backup is coming!

42:10.300 --> 42:12.980
I repeat!
Do not get involved!

42:14.780 --> 42:16.180
Stop!

42:16.820 --> 42:19.100
What's your problem?

42:30.220 --> 42:31.660
Police!

42:59.740 --> 43:01.420
Get on your knees!

43:02.660 --> 43:05.100
Don't move!

43:08.180 --> 43:11.340
On your knees with your
hands above your head!

43:11.375 --> 43:13.380
You! Freeze!

43:28.900 --> 43:30.660
<i>Go there.</i>

43:30.940 --> 43:33.060
<i>Stand there!</i>

43:33.095 --> 43:34.620
<i>Name?</i>

43:34.900 --> 43:36.620
<i>Phone number</i>

43:36.900 --> 43:39.020
<i>Stay!
Phone number</i>

43:41.860 --> 43:44.660
Officer, please turn off
the air conditioning.

43:45.420 --> 43:47.680
And a towel too?

43:47.715 --> 43:49.940
I fear I may be catching cold.

43:50.180 --> 43:53.060
Lower the temperature.

44:03.300 --> 44:05.300
I ask again.

44:05.420 --> 44:07.820
What is your relationship with the deceased?

44:08.340 --> 44:10.540
He was a close friend.

44:10.575 --> 44:13.060
I'm in shock.

44:13.460 --> 44:15.180
I hope you can help me.

44:15.215 --> 44:17.180
Please help me.

44:17.580 --> 44:18.610
Okay.

44:18.620 --> 44:20.500
If you avoid cooperation with us,

44:20.535 --> 44:22.105
...And try to lie...

44:22.140 --> 44:25.100
...We will continue to
ask the same question.

44:25.135 --> 44:27.097
But do not forget,

44:27.132 --> 44:29.060
...You'll freeze to death here.

44:34.980 --> 44:36.905
I'm not going to lie.

44:36.940 --> 44:39.380
But I do not really know anything.

44:39.415 --> 44:40.745
I do not know anything.

44:40.780 --> 44:43.120
One of my friends was just murdered.

44:43.155 --> 44:45.460
Can you not understand my feelings?

44:52.300 --> 44:54.940
Drinking all that water.

44:55.140 --> 44:57.305
Then do a urine test.

44:57.340 --> 44:59.340
Watch whether he under
the influence of drugs or not.

44:59.820 --> 45:02.140
I'm sorry.

45:04.580 --> 45:05.920
I do not need to drink.

45:05.955 --> 45:07.220
Can I pee now?

45:07.230 --> 45:08.630
Glasses are no longer needed, right?

45:14.310 --> 45:15.710
Take the test.

45:24.750 --> 45:26.150
I'm sorry.

45:26.440 --> 45:27.555
I cannot tell you where it came from.

45:27.590 --> 45:29.910
All I saw was brains all over the room.

45:31.330 --> 45:32.530
Everything was calm...

45:32.565 --> 45:33.695
...He had the situation handled.

45:33.730 --> 45:35.130
But you don't respect him.

45:35.610 --> 45:36.890
Do I have to tell you a hundred times?

45:36.900 --> 45:37.885
It wasn't our people that shot!

45:37.920 --> 45:39.360
Do you understand?

45:39.900 --> 45:41.300
I'm just saying there are
people who shoot...

45:41.330 --> 45:42.730
...Did I accuse you?

45:42.890 --> 45:44.310
Is it you insinuating that
I asked someone to shoot?

45:45.270 --> 45:46.670
Be serious!

45:46.910 --> 45:48.310
Surely you should not have been there.

45:48.510 --> 45:49.910
We would already know everything by now.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.420
Do you have the evidence to arrest him?

45:51.455 --> 45:52.090
Is there evidence?

45:52.100 --> 45:53.570
If you have evidence then lock him up!
Ok?

45:54.300 --> 45:55.535
You already had information on him.

45:55.570 --> 45:56.770
So why don't you?

45:56.900 --> 45:58.440
I have enough data to arrest him.

45:58.650 --> 46:00.450
Bang, do you know the purpose of a decoy?

46:00.740 --> 46:01.630
Everyone knows...

46:01.640 --> 46:03.500
There must be distraction

46:03.760 --> 46:05.370
He just wanted to use me as a scapegoat
and let me die.

46:05.590 --> 46:06.990
Zi Long please use Mandarin.

46:07.170 --> 46:08.710
What he means is,

46:08.960 --> 46:10.360
...You just want to let him die.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.365
Tell me why I want him dead?

46:11.400 --> 46:13.060
You just fought a whole gang
and you aren't dead.

46:13.310 --> 46:14.925
If we didn't act you would be dead!

46:14.960 --> 46:16.540
You think you're working with me?
or I in a partnership with you?

46:16.830 --> 46:17.585
You're misunderstanding.

46:17.620 --> 46:19.740
The massacre occurred in China,
so it's already my business.

46:20.060 --> 46:22.150
I'm working with you!
So why should it not be?

46:22.360 --> 46:23.555
You're about dumber than a damn brick!

46:23.590 --> 46:25.380
You are working with me,
is that clear? Stupid!

46:25.600 --> 46:27.320
What did you say?
I aughta...

46:27.580 --> 46:29.590
You better check yourself!
I aughta smack the shit out of your ass!

46:30.600 --> 46:32.000
Fuck you.

46:33.380 --> 46:34.780
And fuck you back!

46:35.290 --> 46:37.140
...Chen Zi Long!

46:37.175 --> 46:38.990
You think I won't fuck you up?

46:39.320 --> 46:40.575
Please calm down!

46:40.610 --> 46:42.010
This is their excuse for a cop.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.415
Go fuck yourself!

46:43.450 --> 46:44.850
You will not be a fucking cop again.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.540
You are fucking worthless!

46:46.790 --> 46:48.155
Enough.

46:48.190 --> 46:50.250
What's wrong pussy?
Your little bitch ass feelings hurt?

46:50.500 --> 46:52.910
Zi Long, you are not Police material!

46:54.110 --> 46:55.510
Cultural differences.

46:55.990 --> 46:58.860
I hope we can pull this together
for the sake of the investigation.

47:05.270 --> 47:06.595
A Long...

47:06.630 --> 47:08.070
Wait, I'll show mom.

47:09.290 --> 47:10.690
<i>Look what</i>

47:12.350 --> 47:15.510
That's very high, I'm getting dizzy!

47:15.840 --> 47:17.240
Beautiful, isn't it?

47:18.100 --> 47:19.265
Very beautiful!

47:19.300 --> 47:20.395
Do you remember

47:20.430 --> 47:22.410
When I was little I liked to sit on
your shoulders mother?

47:22.700 --> 47:25.110
You told me I'll see the world
clearly if I sit this high.

47:25.360 --> 47:25.965
Remember?

47:26.000 --> 47:28.740
That's all you called to say?

47:29.530 --> 47:30.930
Maybe I can show this to my partner.

47:31.790 --> 47:33.950
A Long, in this world...

47:34.200 --> 47:35.780
You must have patience...

47:36.030 --> 47:37.540
...Everything will settle in time.

47:37.760 --> 47:39.160
You understand?

47:39.480 --> 47:41.250
<i>You must stay on your path.</i>

47:41.500 --> 47:42.900
<i>you can overcome anything</i>

47:43.410 --> 47:44.820
You will get what your heart desires..

47:45.920 --> 47:47.870
Mom, maybe I should stay a gangster...

47:48.390 --> 47:50.300
Child hush!
I know better than that!

47:51.220 --> 47:52.620
I know, I know.

47:52.860 --> 47:54.260
Or maybe I'm just crazy ma...

48:10.610 --> 48:12.010
Good morning sir.

48:22.210 --> 48:23.610
Take it all!

48:36.370 --> 48:37.425
<i>Brother Kun,</i>

48:37.460 --> 48:38.860
<i>...I'm definitely going to kill Sunny.</i>

48:39.220 --> 48:40.620
<i>Vengeance will be yours.</i>

49:05.380 --> 49:06.780
Damn!
Missed again.

49:07.380 --> 49:08.780
Sorry.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.680
I've haven't been shooting for too long...

49:13.980 --> 49:15.380
...Since graduating from the police academy.

49:16.560 --> 49:17.905
If I do not practice...

49:17.940 --> 49:19.340
...My ass is going to be a desk jockey.

49:20.700 --> 49:22.100
...Since I'm a cop again.

49:22.730 --> 49:24.130
You know why you miss?

49:25.780 --> 49:27.180
Police weapons are very calibrated.

49:27.740 --> 49:29.900
Hold yourself firmly and steadily.

49:30.510 --> 49:33.010
Eyes must look straight down
the barrel at the target.

49:34.080 --> 49:35.480
You try.

49:47.690 --> 49:49.090
I'm a shooter,

49:49.290 --> 49:50.710
...Just barely failed to be an Olympic
national shooter.

49:52.200 --> 49:53.600
By the skin of my teeth

49:54.560 --> 49:55.960
I've been shooting since I was six.

49:57.530 --> 49:59.470
How did you get around the forest...

50:00.090 --> 50:01.600
...When you can only see a tree?

50:02.570 --> 50:03.970
And you do no wrong...

50:05.660 --> 50:07.060
...You are infallible.

50:07.200 --> 50:08.970
I just have a goal to attain

50:09.450 --> 50:10.800
I cannot be like you.

50:10.835 --> 50:12.150
No plan, no direction,...

50:12.430 --> 50:13.830
...And worse, no target.

50:16.950 --> 50:18.350
No need to be rude.

50:19.550 --> 50:20.950
Now show me how good
you are at using a weapon.

50:40.520 --> 50:41.920
Can you get away?

50:51.970 --> 50:53.370
Ah ha, a little slow there aren't you?

50:55.270 --> 50:56.355
A lot will catch you by surprise,

50:56.390 --> 50:57.790
Unless you know how to adapt, improvise.

51:01.300 --> 51:02.700
Where ya goin?

51:11.170 --> 51:12.570
Now you're in violation.

51:12.600 --> 51:14.440
Not allowed to use an air pistol
even in China.

51:15.550 --> 51:16.950
Now you're the villain.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.390
This time I'll just seize it.

51:18.425 --> 51:19.790
Next time I see you,

51:19.850 --> 51:21.250
...I'll arrest you.

51:22.780 --> 51:23.935
Remember that, okay?

51:23.970 --> 51:25.090
You're taking my gun!

51:25.200 --> 51:26.600
Goodbye.

51:28.250 --> 51:29.650
Asshole!

51:34.340 --> 51:35.690
Brother Xiong.

51:35.725 --> 51:37.090
A Long.

51:37.570 --> 51:38.950
Come in.

51:38.985 --> 51:40.330
Have a seat.

51:48.560 --> 51:49.930
So you think I killed my friend?

51:49.965 --> 51:51.330
You stupid?

51:52.070 --> 51:53.470
Do you think A Long believes that?

51:55.080 --> 51:56.920
We don't need any infighting.

51:58.500 --> 51:59.900
Our information is accurate,

52:00.340 --> 52:01.960
...Daofeng is the culprit.

52:03.420 --> 52:05.370
In this case, one
of you will be killed.

52:06.910 --> 52:08.360
Unless you find the people
who are targeting you.

52:10.080 --> 52:12.110
We can end all this shit now.

52:13.850 --> 52:15.250
This is a photograph and address.

52:19.970 --> 52:21.370
It's as good as done.

52:23.450 --> 52:24.850
We are good friends again...

52:25.340 --> 52:26.780
...After drinking this wine.

52:28.170 --> 52:29.570
Come on.

52:36.280 --> 52:37.680
Cheers! Go knock that out.

52:39.330 --> 52:40.730
We're on it.

52:51.360 --> 52:53.160
Sunny was lucky last time.

52:53.350 --> 52:54.750
No mistakes this time.

52:55.320 --> 52:57.030
<i>I've given them your location</i>

52:57.230 --> 52:58.300
<i>You don't have much time.</i>

52:58.335 --> 52:59.335
He will come looking for you...

52:59.370 --> 53:00.770
...For revenge against the brother Kun.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.520
This is your last chance.

53:03.900 --> 53:05.300
<i>After everything is finished,</i>

53:05.590 --> 53:06.990
<i>...I will organize your return.
Okay?</i>

53:32.830 --> 53:33.800
What are you doing here?

53:33.835 --> 53:35.200
We're working.

53:36.450 --> 53:37.850
I barely recognize the place.

53:40.680 --> 53:42.080
You guys have been really busy.

53:52.090 --> 53:53.490
Any information?

53:53.790 --> 53:55.860
Shunfeng Hotel, room 204.

53:57.240 --> 53:58.640
Where did you get this address?

53:59.790 --> 54:01.190
My boss gave it to me.

54:02.130 --> 54:03.530
Okay, let's trail leads.

54:06.290 --> 54:07.690
This is the Captain.

54:07.720 --> 54:09.120
Hello, captain.

54:09.230 --> 54:10.630
There is new information.

54:11.350 --> 54:12.950
- And now we know where the sniper is.
- Hey, wait a minute!

54:13.580 --> 54:14.980
I want to investigate.

54:15.830 --> 54:17.230
Okay, I will organize this.

54:17.740 --> 54:19.140
We're moving in.

54:19.170 --> 54:20.910
This information may not be accurate.

54:21.240 --> 54:22.155
Maybe I'm wrong.

54:22.190 --> 54:23.730
Why do you think it's false information?

54:23.765 --> 54:25.270
It's just too easy. It may be a setup.

54:25.950 --> 54:27.350
He may have been tipped off
that we're coming.

54:27.400 --> 54:28.605
I have a hunch.

54:28.640 --> 54:30.180
- Don't just jump...
- Look, shut up!

54:30.380 --> 54:31.780
Come on, move.

54:32.740 --> 54:33.780
Okay, I'm going with you.

54:33.790 --> 54:35.190
Please listen to me.

54:36.240 --> 54:37.217
You can't be so rash.

54:37.230 --> 54:38.908
No problem, true or false, we have to act.

54:39.086 --> 54:40.695
And you do not have to go.

54:40.730 --> 54:41.840
The fuck do you mean?

54:43.760 --> 54:45.240
I'm sorry, but you're not a cop anymore.

54:45.840 --> 54:47.360
This is very complicated,
so watch the news here.

54:49.070 --> 54:51.350
Do not rush.
I'm much more experienced than you.

54:51.870 --> 54:53.270
Female.

55:25.170 --> 55:26.570
We're going in...

55:36.340 --> 55:37.081
That way.

55:37.242 --> 55:39.350
Yes Ma'am!

56:33.460 --> 56:35.150
Walking right into a clusterfuck...

56:44.708 --> 56:46.940
Sniper is right there!

58:39.350 --> 58:40.750
Shoot.

58:40.770 --> 58:42.170
Do not think.

58:44.160 --> 58:45.560
Shoot.

58:49.970 --> 58:51.370
Shoot.

58:52.930 --> 58:54.330
Sho...

59:49.030 --> 59:50.430
Here.

59:50.670 --> 59:53.210
Take it.

59:56.400 --> 59:57.800
This glass is yours.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.230
Listen to me, you've done your job.

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:13.870
Yes, that's right.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.260
I shot him,

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:18.260
...By the way...

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.370
That was a nice shot too.

01:00:20.405 --> 01:00:21.900
Very good, very good...

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:23.860
You had to do it.

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:28.030
Stop crying.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:30.485
Okay.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.920
Come on, let's play.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.940
Come, come...

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.600
Come on.

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:39.925
Come.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.360
I'll show you.

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:42.980
Come on, shoot!

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:44.255
Target's set up.

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:46.270
- You got another weapon?
- Hey lighten up.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.840
This is just a pistol.

01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:49.675
What are you doing?

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:51.760
Do you not realize that
I am very sad right now?

01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:53.535
I've...

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:54.970
You just killed a man.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.840
Listen to me.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.910
If you did not kill him.

01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:01.810
He'd kill more people!

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.840
If I died today,

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.110
...You wouldn't be sadder?

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:08.730
Does that thought help?

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:09.925
Shut up!

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.360
You don't know how I feel!

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:12.910
I don't know how you feel?

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.195
How don't I know?

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:15.430
How can you say so?

01:01:15.465 --> 01:01:17.400
You're awfully sure of yourself.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.990
You are a police officer!

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.140
You have a job to do!

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:23.670
Do you understand, idiot?

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.820
Mari.

01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:27.725
Come on.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.490
Take the damn gun!

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:34.050
Shoot the damn target!

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:40.020
That's natural instinct.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:47.730
You have to remember,...

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:51.500
...This life experience.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.880
Do not regret it.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.920
Remember it.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.000
...And do not ever forget it!

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:11.010
Do not cry.

01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:13.710
So the gun...

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:15.650
...I have to confiscate it.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.020
Hater!

01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:23.410
Hater!

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.170
You leaked the information
to the cops didn't you?

01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:51.670
We're clean, no implications.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.600
You okay?

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.040
Why should I believe you?

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.500
Don't trust me?

01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:00.430
I see you're not in a good mood.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.680
Do we have a problem?

01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:07.010
Good question, do we?

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.780
I'll ask you again.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:15.235
In this world.

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:16.670
All you got is your balls and your word

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.700
If I didn't get the rogue caught up

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:21.860
Maybe he would have put
a bullet through your head...

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:25.310
You don't play fair to
succeed in this profession!

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.440
I've explained.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.480
The Boss sent brother Kun to kill me...

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.300
Then asked you to kill him.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.480
If everyone died, he was still happy.

01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:37.370
Chen Zi Long...

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.520
You do not qualify as a boss.

01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:45.890
But if you come with me,

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.580
...I guarantee people will not dare
look down on you again.

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:53.950
We are talking about cooperation.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.440
...And you can help me.

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:00.700
To higher positions,

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.080
...You have to trust me.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.840
Think about it!

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.050
I have information on every
crime committed by the family.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.470
<i>The data will be zipped into a file</i>

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:21.970
<i>And encrypted</i>

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.800
<i>What's the point of this data?</i>

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.410
Is it fair that everyone lives in
fear but the privileged few?

01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:30.070
How much will they pay for
their security is all I ask.

01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:32.450
Extortion, Blackmail...

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.270
What they gonna do?
Call the cops?

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:38.370
A great plan.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:40.060
I hope we can pull it off.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.980
You ever tried before?

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.440
Of course, I have.

01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:46.850
Behold me now.

01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:49.750
I am filled with success.

01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:52.450
And now I have a legitimate dealer.

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:54.540
No one knows what I do behind these doors

01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:58.250
Except you...

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.480
...And you.

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:05.530
I'll keep it a secret,
so will you.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.720
Let us unite our efforts!

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.770
If I find you are a rat..

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:20.110
First your mother dies...

01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:22.500
Then you...

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:26.405
<i>How does it work?</i>

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.340
<i>Bossman will send you over here
to download this document.</i>

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.550
<i>I'll load it to a flash drive</i>

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:32.880
<i>So you can blackmail them
with the data.</i>

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:34.800
<i>Once successful,
we will divide the money.</i>

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.500
<i>If it succeeds</i>

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.960
<i>...we will lay the Boss's</i>

01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:39.670
<i>money in our hands.</i>

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.560
<i>He will notify you tomorrow.</i>

01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:47.720
Does your mother know
you're an undercover cop?

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:54.670
At first I thought she did not know.

01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:56.590
Apparently she already knows it all,

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.600
...Our relationship is very strange.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.695
We're both...

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:04.130
...The best of friends.

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:06.600
See, these tattoos.

01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:09.110
I did them special for my mother.

01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:11.370
This tattoo as a symbol of...

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:12.830
...Her protection.

01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:17.750
Why a tattoo?

01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:20.190
You know, I have to live
like a gangster.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.240
You might never understand.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.840
...It's a lifestyle.

01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:26.940
I live like a gangster.

01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:28.590
I must seem like a big brother.

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.360
And the tattoos help that image.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.240
...That's not a problem for me.

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:35.110
Which one is your favorite?

01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:37.610
On my back.

01:06:37.645 --> 01:06:38.790
I like that one.

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:40.920
How do you know when you've never seen it?

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:43.720
I know everything about you.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.810
So you've seen all my tattoos...

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:49.940
Why are you doing this?

01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:51.590
So I can be a Cop again.

01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:57.010
Will the Hong Kong police...

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.900
...Take you with so many tattoos?

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:03.010
That's a good question...

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.870
Regardless of what they say.

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:08.860
Even if they don't take you

01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:11.690
I will vouch for you here,
I want us partners.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.220
When the time comes, I
will flower all these tattoos.

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:16.650
Or that laser removal thingy..

01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:18.255
...Right right.

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:20.500
It's very important to me to be a Cop.

01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:23.860
So what is most important thing about it?

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.780
Of course catching criminals.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.920
And you?

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.060
Of course catching criminals.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.320
We will arrest criminals.

01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:35.460
And we'll be the best.

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.786
Go as fast as possible as you
only you can get the data.

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:10.390
<i>Zi Long thought I was unconscious.</i>

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.420
<i>But, I saw him
speaking to the police.</i>

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.689
<i>Zi Long is an undercover cop.</i>

01:08:20.649 --> 01:08:22.840
<i>Zi Long thought I was unconscious.</i>

01:08:23.529 --> 01:08:26.149
<i>But, I saw him
speaking to the police.</i>

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.490
<i>Zi Long is an undercover cop.</i>

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.340
<i>Zi Long thought I was unconscious.</i>

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:34.840
<i>But, I saw him
speaking to the police.</i>

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.399
<i>Zi Long is an undercover cop.</i>

01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:13.710
We will not let him get away.

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:15.840
We have plenty of evidence.

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.960
...They will be arrested.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.240
You do not have to do anything.

01:09:22.270 --> 01:09:23.670
Go rest up.

01:09:24.029 --> 01:09:25.430
...And I'll find you
after everything is over.

01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:49.604
<i>Chen Zi Long.</i>

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.229
<i>Why did you beat the thief into a coma?</i>

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:52.870
<i>His family is suing you</i>

01:09:54.029 --> 01:09:55.790
We're taking your badge.
Hand in your uniform.

01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:58.520
<i>Hooligans fight, you are a policeman!</i>

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.240
I didn't know he was an English tourist.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.800
The man was a thief.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:03.325
Zi Long.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.910
The only way for you to continue.

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:06.570
Is if you are demoted to informant.

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:24.840
<i>Now it's very dangerous,
you cannot come with me.</i>

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.830
<i>Brother Sunny!
I will never betray you!</i>

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:30.350
<i>Brother Sunny, believe me!</i>

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.020
<i>Terry, throw them into the sea.</i>

01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:34.610
<i>Brother Sunny!</i>

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.920
<i>Brother Sunny.</i>

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:38.330
Sunny's gone crazy.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.960
He's killing everyone.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:41.770
No evidence, no witnesses...

01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:43.510
I need protection.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.595
Party time!

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:52.030
I know my own way.

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.500
You Changmaoxiong?

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.610
You a cop?

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:08.370
You're setting them all up aren't you?

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.110
Good question.

01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:13.570
Those wise men.

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.180
Of course, I want them to kill each other.

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:18.090
You're a heartless rogue!

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.960
You're not worth dying for.

01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:23.930
Everything went according to plan.

01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:29.750
I've long known your boy was police.

01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:33.640
<i>I went to visit his brother.</i>

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.300
<i>He told me.</i>

01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:37.110
<i>Zi Long thought I was unconscious.</i>

01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:39.920
<i>But, I saw him
speaking to the police.</i>

01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:42.150
<i>Zi Long is an undercover cop.</i>

01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:44.810
<i>So I knew he was a cop.</i>

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:47.190
<i>I bet.</i>

01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:49.210
If he is a policeman...

01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:51.280
...And agrees to work for me.

01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:53.390
I'll have my own undercover operative.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.400
Not everything will run
according to what you have planned.

01:11:57.130 --> 01:11:58.630
He is hot on your trail.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.290
If you're going to arrest me
get it over with!

01:12:00.325 --> 01:12:01.525
I gotta pee.

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.419
Why are you just standing
there? Want to see my dick?

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:05.110
Look, here's a peek!

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.040
Bitch, how dare you hit me!

01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:21.390
Stop, police!

01:12:21.803 --> 01:12:23.990
Sir! She attacked me!
I had to defend myself!

01:12:24.455 --> 01:12:26.462
I didn't see it..

01:12:26.497 --> 01:12:27.710
You, you okay?

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:29.300
Officer, he beat me!

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.020
My head hurts

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.719
She seems badly injured.
Take her to the hospital.

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.992
- What the?
- Were you saying something?

01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:38.620
All your henchmen have been arrested.

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:40.270
You're alone here.

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:41.540
Zhangmaoxiong.

01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:43.510
We have enough evidence to prove you're
involved in organized crime.

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:45.560
We suspect that you are
involved in a lot of cases.

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:47.670
Follow me into the office for questioning.

01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:53.240
Sure, Zi Long had given you
all of the data on me.

01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:55.910
I was ready.

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.480
Just did not expect him
to go through with it.

01:12:58.515 --> 01:12:59.880
I've hit a woman.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.400
It was a trap.

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:06.530
To arrest you.

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:15.130
Bring him.

01:13:15.165 --> 01:13:16.530
Yes.

01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:18.270
Oh, Officer Zhang.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.345
Wait.

01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.670
You might want to check on
your nephew at home.

01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:24.270
Move!

01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:31.130
<i>If I find out you're a rat...</i>

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.260
<i>Your mother dies, then you...</i>

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:41.620
You didn't know your son
was an undercover cop?

01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:45.530
You knew what would happen if we found out.

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.060
Sunny,

01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:53.150
...He's my son.

01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:56.700
He is not that smart and
always caused some trouble.

01:13:57.390 --> 01:14:00.300
I am responsible for any offense...

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.280
Well, get ready to pay up.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.760
Your son has sealed your fate!

01:14:07.795 --> 01:14:09.160
Of course, I accept!

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.240
I have no problem with that.

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:13.270
But if you dare hurt my son,

01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:14.550
...We will die together!

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.320
I will kill you myself!

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.180
He taught me about loyalty.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.600
And I believed him.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.440
But he's betrayed me now.

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:44.450
My son did not have a family.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.480
Whatever the price.
I must bear it.

01:15:01.710 --> 01:15:02.815
Mom you will be okay.

01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:04.250
Everything will be okay.

01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:06.570
Mom can take him.

01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:12.600
Mom, be calm.

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:14.250
Everything will be okay.

01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:16.590
Mom, be calm.

01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:47.690
Zi Long, relax.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:49.055
I know your family's tragedy.

01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:50.265
I completely empathize.

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:51.970
...Your application has been received.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.920
Your mission is complete.

01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:55.850
Please do not go crazy

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.360
If you act rashly, everything you've
done for 8 years will be in vein.

01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:59.990
Zi Long, we have worked
together a little while.

01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:02.210
I know you are suffering
from this injustice...

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:04.525
And you got what you wanted.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.840
You can be a cop again.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.200
Now you're the one running on emotion!

01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:10.600
We will get justice!

01:16:10.635 --> 01:16:12.000
Enough.

01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:13.930
They've hurt my mother.

01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:18.190
Would you accept it if your
mother is assaulted?

01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:35.620
Sir! Ma'am! She is woke and coherent.

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.460
Fucking useless.

01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:08.970
This is my money!

01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:10.930
You going somewhere?

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.660
I couldn't find you.

01:17:16.695 --> 01:17:18.060
...So I took the money,...

01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:21.050
To give you when we met up.

01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:23.030
You think that I want to run away?

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:25.870
I would never steal from my brother.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.480
I'm not about that life.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.590
Every time I worked for
you, I never let you down.

01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:33.260
And you think I would start now?

01:17:33.295 --> 01:17:34.660
I heard you called the police.

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:37.040
You said there was no evidence against me.

01:17:40.190 --> 01:17:41.590
That's a lie.

01:17:41.970 --> 01:17:43.370
Where did you hear that?

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.180
You did not ever trust me.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.760
You kidding me?

01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:49.315
How am I going to believe you?

01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:50.640
How am I going to believe that shit!

01:17:50.675 --> 01:17:51.545
I ought to fuck you up.

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.980
Believe me, we are brothers,

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.505
...I would not ever betray you.

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.110
We've been working together
since we were in America.

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:57.900
For three years.

01:17:58.410 --> 01:17:59.810
We've been comrades.

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:02.780
Believe me.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.680
I would not sell you out for money.

01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:08.390
You want me to live, I live...

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.960
You want me to die, I die.

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:12.850
Fucking useless.

01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:14.260
Pet not even like you.

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:15.780
We're brothers,

01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:17.270
...And I've
helped you kill a lot of people.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.620
You cannot run away from that!

01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:21.510
You are the one running.

01:18:29.644 --> 01:18:31.790
You son of a bitch!

01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:44.450
Do not blame me, you betrayed me first.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.040
I feel sorry for your ass!

01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:48.430
You never came to see me.

01:18:48.465 --> 01:18:49.600
...But you come try to beat
my mother to death?

01:18:49.635 --> 01:18:50.840
You're the one that put her at risk!

01:18:50.875 --> 01:18:51.925
You got nerve talking.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.800
You're a backstabbing sack of shit!

01:18:53.835 --> 01:18:55.640
I'd never be loyal to a bastard like you!

01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:04.470
Get the fuck out the way!

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.280
Move!

01:29:16.930 --> 01:29:18.330
Zi Long.

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.290
You're a traitorous dog.

01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:21.970
So you want to go back to being a cop?

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.480
Can you arrest me?

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.480
You can't even beat me in a fight.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.920
You never win!

01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:06.650
I've learned more since then.

01:32:31.670 --> 01:32:33.070
Sorry I'm late again.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.480
I've been bogged down with work.

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.500
...Your application letter.

01:32:36.535 --> 01:32:37.900
What about it?

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.060
The superior I do not agree.

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:40.460
What now?

01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:42.030
I learned English!

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:49.020
Now I already know the law clearly!
What the fuck?

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.570
We don't speak English anymore.

01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.220
We speak Mandarin now.

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:56.080
I've tried to help you.

01:32:56.115 --> 01:32:57.025
Zhang Jianlong.

01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:58.290
No use calling my name.

01:32:58.325 --> 01:32:58.885
I tried my best.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:01.100
I'll kick your ass!

01:33:01.486 --> 01:33:02.760
Stop!

01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:05.430
Hey.

01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:12.125
What are you doing here?

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:14.380
Surprised? What you been up to?

01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:17.780
Taking care of my mother.

01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:21.710
Your appearance

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:23.240
It is quite different.

01:33:29.530 --> 01:33:30.930
You'll get used to it.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.400
I came to Hong Kong on business.

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:40.760
I have some news

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.230
...But I'm not sure
whether to tell or not.

01:33:44.530 --> 01:33:45.930
Tell me.

01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:49.990
There is no place for you
in the police department.

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.360
What?

01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:54.730
I'm sorry I did all I could.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.320
What?

01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:03.030
Just kidding.

01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:06.020
Congratulations, you are back on the force.

01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:11.820
I've been accepted!

01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:16.020
I've been accepted!

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:19.700
I've been accepted!

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:21.845
Thank you.

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:23.300
You've achieved your dream.

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.520
I want to help you pack.

01:34:32.692 --> 01:34:35.180
Ms. Fang Jing!

01:34:43.130 --> 01:34:45.290
You had my back all the way,
I appreciate it.

01:34:50.037 --> 01:34:53.880
Hey! Your mother asked
did you get the sauce!

01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:57.540
I forgot, I'll go get it!

01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:07.470
<i>When I was little,</i>

01:35:07.890 --> 01:35:09.840
<i>...My mother always put me on her shoulders,</i>

01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:12.860
<i>just so that I could see...</i>

01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:14.470
<i>...the best place in this world...</i>

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.010
<i>...Like I was flying in the sky.</i>

01:35:19.530 --> 01:35:21.150
<i>I'll never forget that.</i>

01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:22.740
<i>...I just know...</i>

01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:26.490
<i>...I feel like I’m flying again.</i>
