WEBVTT

00:40.475 --> 00:41.824
OKAY, GANG, REMEMBER,

00:41.867 --> 00:43.391
A NEW YORK CHRISTMAS
IS ONE-OF-A-KIND,

00:43.434 --> 00:45.132
SO EVEN THOUGH WE'VE DONE
AN AMAZING JOB WITH THE LOBBY,

00:45.175 --> 00:47.134
I WANT TO KEEP
CHANGING THINGS UP EVERY DAY

00:47.177 --> 00:48.309
SO PEOPLE WANT
TO COME BACK.

00:48.352 --> 00:50.702
AARON, LET'S WORK
ON THE LIGHTING DESIGN

00:50.746 --> 00:51.877
IN THE COURTYARD.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.183
MAYBE SNOWFLAKES PROJECTED
ON THE WALL?

00:53.227 --> 00:54.489
SHAUNA,

00:54.532 --> 00:55.881
LET'S PUT ALL THE GOLDEN LIGHTS
ON THE TREES

00:55.925 --> 00:57.709
AND THEN KEEP THE
ICICLES FOR THE STAIRS...

00:57.753 --> 00:59.798
AND DAISY, CAN YOU START
WORKING THE RESTAURANT?

00:59.842 --> 01:01.452
GREAT, THANKS.

01:01.496 --> 01:02.279
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

01:02.323 --> 01:03.367
UH, FINE. GOOD.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.108
I MEAN, AS LONG
AS I KEEP BUSY,

01:05.152 --> 01:07.110
YOU KNOW,
DISTRACTION IS WELCOME.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.459
JUST FORGET ABOUT HIM.

01:08.503 --> 01:09.721
HE WASN'T WORTH IT.

01:09.765 --> 01:12.507
IN A MONTH'S TIME,
YOU WON'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM.

01:12.550 --> 01:13.595
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THAT,

01:13.638 --> 01:15.118
BUT THANK YOU, JO.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.859
-I APPRECIATE IT.
-YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.643
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.080
I WILL, THANKS.

01:22.473 --> 01:23.387
UH...

01:23.431 --> 01:24.475
HEADS UP.

01:24.519 --> 01:25.911
JACOBS IS APPROACHING
AT 12 O'CLOCK,

01:25.955 --> 01:27.957
AND HE DOESN'T LOOK HAPPY.

01:31.352 --> 01:32.875
MR. JACOBS,
GOOD EVENING.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.704
SARAH,
AS MY INTERIOR DESIGNER,

01:35.747 --> 01:37.488
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE
OUR LOBBY LOOK AMAZING

01:37.532 --> 01:38.359
EACH CHRISTMAS...

01:39.751 --> 01:40.839
AND YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

01:40.883 --> 01:42.754
THE AFTERNOON EDITION
OF THE SENTINEL

01:42.798 --> 01:43.886
JUST RAVED
ABOUT OUR WINDOW DECORATIONS

01:43.929 --> 01:44.930
IN THEIR STYLE COLUMN,

01:44.974 --> 01:46.367
ALL THANKS TO YOU.

01:46.410 --> 01:49.152
THANK YOU, SIR.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.415
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE MERGER,

01:51.459 --> 01:54.157
WE'RE ADDING A DOZEN HOTELS
TO OUR PORTFOLIO.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.637
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE
THE CHIEF DESIGNER

01:55.680 --> 01:57.421
FOR THE ENTIRE HOTEL CHAIN?

01:57.465 --> 01:59.423
SIR, I WOULD LOVE THAT.

01:59.467 --> 02:00.772
I MEAN, IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN A DREAM OF MINE...

02:00.816 --> 02:02.165
-I THINK THAT...

02:02.209 --> 02:03.123
SORRY,
I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.167
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.082
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
IN THE NEW YEAR.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.650
OKAY. THANK YOU.

02:08.693 --> 02:09.825
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

02:19.139 --> 02:20.749
SO?
WHAT DID HE WANT?

02:20.792 --> 02:23.230
WELL, APPARENTLY,
THE SENTINEL LOVED OUR LOBBY,

02:23.273 --> 02:25.536
SO HE WAS VERY HAPPY.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.973
SARAH, THAT'S GREAT!
CONGRATULATIONS!

02:28.017 --> 02:30.541
YEAH, IT IS.

02:30.585 --> 02:33.109
OH, COME ON.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.458
JUST...

02:34.502 --> 02:36.243
JUST...
STOP THINKING ABOUT HIM.

02:36.286 --> 02:38.984
IT'S HARD.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.203
I MEAN,
YOU REALIZE WE WERE TOGETHER

02:40.247 --> 02:41.465
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF,

02:41.509 --> 02:42.945
AND THEN HE MEETS THIS ACTRESS,

02:42.988 --> 02:44.294
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE DUMPS ME LIKE THAT.

02:46.514 --> 02:47.732
SUPPOSE NOW I HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY

02:47.776 --> 02:50.213
OF BEING CHASED DOWN
BY THE PRESS...

02:50.257 --> 02:52.128
ALL BECAUSE HE CREATED
SOME SILLY WEBSITE.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.217
UH...

02:54.261 --> 02:55.697
IT'S ACTUALLY A SEARCH ENGINE

02:55.740 --> 02:56.611
WITH OVER
A HUNDRED MILLION USERS A MONTH.

02:56.654 --> 02:57.786
IT'S...

02:57.829 --> 02:59.353
UH...

02:59.396 --> 03:00.528
YEAH, I AGREE, IT IS SILLY.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.749
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.577
WHO WOULD CARE
ABOUT OUR LITTLE BREAK-UP?

03:06.621 --> 03:08.579
I MEAN, WE WERE JUST
A BORING COUPLE.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.896
AFTER A HIGH PROFILE BREAK-UP

03:20.939 --> 03:22.680
WITH FIANCEE SARAH MCKINNEY,

03:22.724 --> 03:25.901
TECH TITAN ERIC GOLD
IS NOW DATING HOLLYWOOD STAR

03:25.944 --> 03:27.642
LISA TAYLOR.

03:27.685 --> 03:30.601
UP NEXT, WE'LL SHOW YOU
THE FASHIONS CRAZE

03:30.645 --> 03:32.429
THAT'S GETTING HOLLYWOOD.

03:32.473 --> 03:35.824
GUESS YOU WEREN'T
AS BORING AS YOU THOUGHT.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.436
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO JUST...

03:39.480 --> 03:40.959
LEAVE TOWN?

03:41.003 --> 03:43.310
YES, I JUST NEED
SOME DISTANCE,

03:43.353 --> 03:45.181
AND MY FAMILY'S RANCH
IN COLORADO

03:45.225 --> 03:46.748
IS THE PERFECT PLACE
FOR ME TO SPEND CHRISTMAS.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.619
I MEAN,
SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS,

03:48.663 --> 03:50.273
THE HORSES...

03:50.317 --> 03:52.580
SITTING BY THE FIREPLACE
DRINKING EGGNOG...

03:52.623 --> 03:55.365
THERE'S EVEN
A CHRISTMAS PARADE

03:55.409 --> 03:56.584
THAT ENDS
IN A TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY

03:56.627 --> 03:57.367
RIGHT AT MY FAMILY'S RANCH.

03:58.673 --> 03:59.848
BESIDES,

03:59.891 --> 04:02.416
AFTER WE LOST MY AUNT BETH
THIS YEAR...

04:02.459 --> 04:03.634
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

04:03.678 --> 04:04.722
THAT WE ALL SPEND
CHRISTMAS TOGETHER.

04:04.766 --> 04:07.072
WELL...

04:07.116 --> 04:07.943
YOU DESERVE IT...

04:09.684 --> 04:12.077
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF THINGS
HERE WHILE YOU'RE AWAY.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.514
AH, I KNOW.

04:13.557 --> 04:14.776
NOW GO...

04:14.819 --> 04:17.387
AND HAVE
A MERRY CHRISTMAS.

04:17.431 --> 04:18.997
TWO TICKETS
TO "THE NUTCRACKER" TONIGHT,

04:19.041 --> 04:20.608
FOR YOU AND JIM.

04:20.651 --> 04:21.913
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
JOSEPHINE.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.046
THANK YOU!

04:24.089 --> 04:25.743
SEE YOU IN THE NEW YEAR.

04:46.982 --> 04:47.809
MERRY CHRISTMAS, SIS!

04:48.853 --> 04:50.377
NICE HAT, SANTA.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.335
WHY, THANK YOU, MA'AM.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.945
HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT?

04:53.989 --> 04:56.600
MM, AS GOOD AS ANY RED EYE
FROM NEW YORK CAN POSSIBLY BE,

04:56.644 --> 04:58.254
BUT I'M HERE NOW,
SO I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.429
GOOD.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.343
THE WEATHER'S SUPPOSED
TO BE REALLY NICE

05:00.387 --> 05:01.301
THE REST OF THE WEEK.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.258
SOUNDS GOOD.

05:36.727 --> 05:38.120
YOU OKAY?

05:38.163 --> 05:39.861
I JUST MISS AUNT BETH
RUNNING OUT TO HUG ME HELLO.

05:41.471 --> 05:42.603
I KNOW.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.040
UNCLE ROY'S
IN THE BARN.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.258
HE'LL BE IN SOON.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.521
LET'S GET YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT.

05:53.614 --> 05:54.745
WELL,

05:54.789 --> 05:55.833
I HOPE MY STEAK
AND EGGS LIVED UP

05:55.877 --> 05:56.834
TO YOUR MANHATTAN
STANDARDS.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.532
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

05:58.575 --> 06:00.795
I WOULD TAKE BREAKFAST WITH YOU
OVER BRUNCH AT THE RITZ ANY DAY.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.187
WHAT'S THE RITZ?

06:02.231 --> 06:03.667
WELL, IF YOU EVER CAME
TO VISIT ME IN NEW YORK,

06:03.711 --> 06:04.668
YOU WOULD KNOW.

06:04.712 --> 06:05.756
I KNOW, I KNOW.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.844
I...

06:06.888 --> 06:08.368
I PROMISE,

06:08.411 --> 06:09.804
I WILL TRY AND COME AND VISIT
IN THE SPRING.

06:09.847 --> 06:10.892
OKAY.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.328
BUT YOU'RE HERE NOW,

06:12.372 --> 06:13.547
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
WHILE YOU'RE IN TOWN?

06:13.590 --> 06:15.331
HONESTLY, AS LITTLE
AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.507
THE ONLY THINGS
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

06:17.551 --> 06:20.249
ARE THE TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY
AND THE CHRISTMAS EVE PARADE.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.513
WELL, I HATE TO BE THE
ONE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

06:23.557 --> 06:25.254
BUT THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE
ANY TREE-LIGHTING THIS YEAR.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.342
WHAT?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.039
YEAH,

06:28.083 --> 06:30.607
AND NO CHRISTMAS PARADE EITHER,
BY THE LOOKS OF IT.

06:30.651 --> 06:31.869
WHY?

06:31.913 --> 06:33.393
WITHOUT AUNT BETH,

06:33.436 --> 06:34.611
PAIGE IS STRETCHED TOO THIN
AT THE CAFE

06:34.655 --> 06:36.134
TO ORGANIZE THE PARADE,

06:36.178 --> 06:37.571
AND ROY JUST DOESN'T WANT TO DO
THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTING

06:37.614 --> 06:38.615
WITHOUT HER.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.877
BUT THAT'S OUR TRADITION!

06:39.921 --> 06:41.270
IT'S ALSO A TRADITION

06:41.313 --> 06:42.924
TO HUG YOUR UNCLE
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IN SIX MONTHS.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.143
UNCLE ROY!

06:47.363 --> 06:48.625
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.235
GOOD TO SEE YOU!
HOW ARE YOU?

06:50.279 --> 06:51.802
I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.500
YOU KNOW, KEEPING
BUSY AS ALWAYS.

06:53.543 --> 06:54.805
YOUR BROTHER AND I GOT
OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US,

06:54.849 --> 06:57.591
BUILDING THAT
NEW BARN OUT BACK.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.331
WELL, I'M JUST HAPPY
THAT WE CAN ALL BE TOGETHER,

06:59.375 --> 07:00.681
FOR CHRISTMAS.

07:00.724 --> 07:01.725
ME TOO.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.858
IT'S GOOD
TO HAVE YOU HOME.

07:03.901 --> 07:05.120
GOOD TO BE BACK.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.991
HEY, UNCLE ROY?

07:07.035 --> 07:08.079
DON'T FORGET,

07:08.123 --> 07:09.298
YOU HAVE THAT
ROTARY CLUB LUNCH.

07:09.341 --> 07:11.692
OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
I'M GOING TO BE LATE.

07:11.735 --> 07:12.649
I COULD DROP YOU IN
TOWN, IF YOU LIKE?

07:12.693 --> 07:14.129
YES!

07:14.172 --> 07:14.869
LET ME GO UPSTAIRS AND CHANGE.
I'LL MEET YOU DOWN HERE.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.740
GREAT.

07:37.108 --> 07:38.545
AH!

07:38.588 --> 07:40.024
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE
COMING HOME THIS CHRISTMAS.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.330
I HAD A LAST-MINUTE
CHANGE OF PLANS

07:41.373 --> 07:43.158
OH, I'M SO HAPPY.

07:43.201 --> 07:45.290
PAIGE, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO STOP HUGGING ME,

07:45.334 --> 07:46.509
OR PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO START TALKING.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.032
OH, WHO CARES.
LET 'EM TALK.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.557
OH, GOSH! YAY!

07:51.862 --> 07:53.516
LOOK,

07:53.560 --> 07:55.039
NOBODY LOVES THE CHRISTMAS
PARADE MORE THAN ME,

07:55.083 --> 07:56.911
BUT I AM SWAMPED
THIS YEAR WITH WORK.

07:56.954 --> 07:58.565
BESIDES, I DON'T HAVE
THE CREATIVE GENIUS

07:58.608 --> 08:00.262
THAT RUNS
IN YOUR FAMILY.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.090
YOU COULD PROBABLY DO IT
WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.134
HONESTLY, PAIGE,

08:03.178 --> 08:04.484
I CAME ON THIS VACATION

08:04.527 --> 08:05.746
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO GET AWAY FROM WORK,

08:05.789 --> 08:06.747
NOT PICK UP
ANOTHER PROJECT.

08:06.790 --> 08:07.878
BUT JUST OUT
OF CURIOSITY,

08:07.922 --> 08:10.620
IF YOU WERE IN CHARGE
OF THE PARADE,

08:10.664 --> 08:11.491
HOW WOULD YOU DECORATE?

08:13.449 --> 08:16.278
WELL, I WOULD DEFINITELY USE
AUNT BETH'S GIANT CANDY CANES,

08:16.321 --> 08:17.540
AND THEN I WOULD TAKE
THE PINE BOUGHS

08:17.584 --> 08:19.411
WITH THE RED AND GREEN LANTERNS,

08:19.455 --> 08:20.456
AND I'D PUT THEM UP
OVER THERE,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.066
AND I'D GET
ALL THE STOREFRONTS

08:22.110 --> 08:23.677
TO PAINT THEIR WINDOWS

08:23.720 --> 08:25.113
WITH DIFFERENT SCENES
FROM THE ADVENT CALENDAR,

08:25.156 --> 08:26.680
AND THEN FOR
A REAL COUNTRY CHRISTMAS FEEL,

08:26.723 --> 08:28.333
I'D USE MASON JARS
WITH LIGHTS

08:28.377 --> 08:30.161
AND TWIG GARLANDS
ALL ALONG THE ROUTE.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.598
-THAT'D BE PERFECT.
-GO ON.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.425
OH...

08:33.469 --> 08:34.775
NO, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.385
NICE TRY!
NO, PAIGE...

08:36.428 --> 08:38.430
I JUST WANT TO RELAX.

08:38.474 --> 08:41.521
OKAY, FINE...

08:41.564 --> 08:44.175
AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS
TO MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY,

08:44.219 --> 08:46.395
BUT YOU KNOW THAT THIS WAS
AUNT BETH'S PRIDE AND JOY.

08:46.438 --> 08:47.439
I KNOW, BUT I JUST...

08:47.483 --> 08:48.528
I JUST SPENT
THE PAST HOUR

08:48.571 --> 08:50.138
TELLING YOU
ABOUT MY BROKEN HEART.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.837
WELL,
THIS WILL HELP KEEP YOU BUSY

08:53.881 --> 08:54.664
AND HELP YOU FORGET
MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.666
BESIDES, YOU KNOW

08:56.710 --> 08:59.582
YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO COULD EVER REPLACE HER.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.802
AGH! OKAY!

09:01.845 --> 09:03.891
FINE!

09:03.934 --> 09:05.457
FINE, I WILL...
I WILL DO IT,

09:05.501 --> 09:07.851
BUT I'M DOING THIS
FOR AUNT BETH.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.505
OKAY, SO...

09:09.549 --> 09:10.811
THESE ARE SOME FLYERS
I HAD PRINTED UP

09:10.854 --> 09:11.899
FOR THE CHRISTMAS PARADE

09:11.942 --> 09:12.726
WHEN I THOUGHT
I COULD STILL DO IT.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.815
CONVENIENT.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.515
WELL, AT LEAST
WE'LL HAVE THE PARADE.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.821
YOU KNOW, MY UNCLE ROY

09:20.864 --> 09:21.430
DOESN'T WANT TO DO
THE TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY

09:21.473 --> 09:22.649
THIS YEAR.

09:22.692 --> 09:25.042
YEAH, I HEARD.
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT IT.

09:26.478 --> 09:29.220
I KNEW THIS CHRISTMAS
WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.

09:29.264 --> 09:30.352
GUESS I WAS JUST HOPING

09:30.395 --> 09:32.093
THAT SOME THINGS
WOULD STAY THE SAME.

09:33.703 --> 09:34.617
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:34.661 --> 09:35.836
THAT'S IT.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.577
I AM TAKING THE REST
OF THE AFTERNOON OFF,

09:37.620 --> 09:38.926
AND YOU ARE
COMING WITH ME.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.014
UH-OH.

09:40.057 --> 09:40.928
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT PLANNED?

09:40.971 --> 09:42.233
JUST WAIT AND SEE.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.931
I'LL GO GET
MY COAT.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.241
YOU WERE RIGHT.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.417
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I NEEDED.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.419
STARTING TO FEEL
THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT ALREADY.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.900
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.685
HOW LONG ARE YOU
IN TOWN FOR, ANYWAY?

09:58.728 --> 09:59.773
I'VE GOT TO BE BACK
IN THE OFFICE

09:59.816 --> 10:01.383
IN NINE DAYS.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.907
HOPEFULLY, NEWS OF MY BREAKUP
WILL HAVE DIED DOWN BY THEN.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.387
I'M JUST GLAD YOU SAW
THIS GUY'S TRUE COLORS

10:05.430 --> 10:06.910
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.651
SHOULD HAVE NEVER
DATED A CELEBRITY.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.740
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

10:10.784 --> 10:13.177
WELL, YOU'RE
ALL THE WISER FOR IT.

10:13.221 --> 10:14.352
BESIDES, YOU'LL BE BACK

10:14.396 --> 10:15.397
OUT IN THE DATING WORLD
IN NO TIME.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.398
I DOUBT THAT.

10:18.269 --> 10:20.054
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE LAST ONE.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.490
"MCKINNEY RANCH.

10:21.533 --> 10:24.885
EXPERIENCE WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LIVE AND WORK

10:24.928 --> 10:26.626
ON AN AUTHENTIC HORSE RANCH."

10:28.149 --> 10:29.411
THIS IS IT, PETER!

10:29.454 --> 10:31.543
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.067
I DON'T KNOW.
LOOKS PRETTY RUSTIC.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.459
I'VE GOT A MONTH TO GET READY

10:34.503 --> 10:35.547
BEFORE THIS THING
STARTS SHOOTING.

10:35.591 --> 10:36.940
I WANT TO SHOW UP ON THAT SET

10:36.984 --> 10:38.725
LOOKING LIKE I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.335
THE STUDIO WOULD KILL ME
IF THEY EVER FOUND OUT

10:40.378 --> 10:42.816
I WAS HELPING YOU JEOPARDIZE
THEIR 50-MILLION-DOLLAR FILM.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.167
WHAT WAS THAT?

10:46.210 --> 10:47.081
WHY'D THAT GUY HONK
AND WAVE AT US?

10:47.124 --> 10:47.995
DO YOU THINK HE RECOGNIZED ME?

10:48.038 --> 10:50.519
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.173
HE WAS--

10:52.216 --> 10:53.565
HAVEN'T YOU EVER BEEN
TO A SMALL TOWN BEFORE?

10:53.609 --> 10:55.655
IT'S A FRIENDLY THING.

10:55.698 --> 10:58.396
HE'S JUST DOING
A SMALL-TOWN HONK AND WAVE.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.442
I DON'T WANT TO BE NOTICED,
PETER.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.618
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT, MAN.
IT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.880
YOU DO REALIZE YOU COULD'VE
LEARNED RANCH LIFE

11:03.924 --> 11:07.188
ANYWHERE AROUND L.A., RIGHT?

11:07.231 --> 11:08.406
YEAH, AND I WOULD HAVE HAD
A DOZEN PAPARAZZI

11:08.450 --> 11:09.538
PHOTOGRAPHING AND TAPING ME

11:09.581 --> 11:10.800
EVERY TIME I FELL OFF
A DANG HORSE.

11:10.844 --> 11:11.758
NO THANKS.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.719
THAT, SEE.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.895
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.505
THAT'S THE REAL RANCH LIFE.

11:21.768 --> 11:22.682
LOOK AT THAT.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.162
OKAY. WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

11:25.206 --> 11:26.860
JUST DOING THE SMALL-TOWN
HONK AND WAVE... OOPS.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.339
OOH, SHOOT.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.907
WHOA!
HEY, HEY, HEY.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.343
-YOU OKAY?
-YEAH.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.171
-YOU OKAY?
-I'M FINE.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.217
NICE.

11:37.392 --> 11:38.306
SORRY.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.680
ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'T
YOU GO LOOK AROUND?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.464
I'LL GO SEE IF THEY'RE
OPEN FOR CHRISTMAS.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.249
YEAH.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.993
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

12:13.036 --> 12:14.472
HEY, YOU WANT...

12:14.516 --> 12:15.430
I'VE GOT A COOKIE
FOR YOU.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.823
YOU WANT A COOKIE?

12:18.912 --> 12:20.304
EXCUSE ME?

12:20.348 --> 12:22.002
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:22.045 --> 12:24.395
UM...

12:24.439 --> 12:25.788
ARE YOU ABOUT TO FEED
MY HORSE A COOKIE?

12:25.832 --> 12:28.356
UH, HIS IDEA.

12:28.399 --> 12:29.357
I THINK HE SMELLED IT
THROUGH MY JACKET POCKET, SO...

12:29.400 --> 12:30.793
OKAY, WELL,
FIRST OF ALL,

12:30.837 --> 12:31.751
HE'S A SHE.

12:33.317 --> 12:34.275
REALLY?

12:35.667 --> 12:36.799
WAIT, I KNOW YOU.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.453
HMM.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.368
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO HONKED
AT US OUT ON THE ROAD

12:40.411 --> 12:41.282
AND SCARED THE HORSES.

12:42.370 --> 12:43.806
RIGHT.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.199
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

12:45.242 --> 12:46.896
I WAS TRYING TO DO
THE SMALL-TOWN HONK AND WAVE.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.072
I THINK IT...
THINK IT BACKFIRED.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.031
YEAH, YOU COULD SAY THAT.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.206
GRAHAM MITCHELL.

12:53.598 --> 12:54.469
THE ACTOR?

12:56.993 --> 12:58.647
OH, WELL, THAT EXPLAINS IT.

12:59.822 --> 13:00.649
EXPLAINS WHAT?

13:02.085 --> 13:04.435
WELL...
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.744
SORRY, I'M
SARAH MCKINNEY.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.832
MY UNCLE OWNS
THIS PLACE.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.921
OH... OH!

13:11.965 --> 13:13.662
WELL THEN, YOU'RE THE ONE
I WANT TO TALK TO.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.577
SO, I...
I CAME TO THIS TOWN

13:15.620 --> 13:17.231
LOOKING FOR A PLACE
TO FIND SOMEWHERE

13:17.274 --> 13:19.189
WHERE I CAN LEARN
EVERYTHING ABOUT RANCH LIFE,

13:19.233 --> 13:20.538
JUST THROUGH CHRISTMAS,

13:20.582 --> 13:21.713
AND THIS, I'VE GOT
TO TELL YOU,

13:21.757 --> 13:23.585
LOOKS LIKE
THE PERFECT PLACE.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.848
WELL, WE'RE SHUT DOWN
FOR THE HOLIDAYS, SO...

13:25.892 --> 13:27.284
OKAY, UM...

13:27.328 --> 13:28.720
I'LL WORK?

13:28.764 --> 13:30.113
BE LIKE A RANCH HAND.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.027
YOU ARE AWARE
IT'S CHRISTMAS, RIGHT?

13:31.071 --> 13:33.029
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

13:33.073 --> 13:35.031
UH, LOOK,
THIS WEEK IS...

13:35.075 --> 13:37.642
IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY
FOR US, SO...

13:37.686 --> 13:39.035
-OKAY.
-SORRY.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.167
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT I COULD DO

13:40.210 --> 13:42.212
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND?

13:42.256 --> 13:44.040
I'M AFRAID NOT.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.216
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU,
MR. MITCHELL.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.088
IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU, SARAH.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.352
HEY.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.223
I JUST SPOKE
TO THE OWNER.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.398
IT DOESN'T LOOK
VERY PROMISING.

13:54.442 --> 13:55.878
WHO'S THAT?

13:55.922 --> 13:57.488
UH...

13:57.532 --> 14:00.535
SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T LIKE
MY MOVIES, APPARENTLY.

14:04.887 --> 14:05.888
WHO'S THAT?

14:05.932 --> 14:07.063
THAT, LITTLE BROTHER,

14:07.107 --> 14:08.369
WAS HOLLYWOOD HEART-THROB
GRAHAM MITCHELL.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.284
SERIOUSLY?

14:10.327 --> 14:11.894
YEAH.

14:11.938 --> 14:12.939
HE WANTS TO STAY
AT THE RANCH FOR A WEEK

14:12.982 --> 14:14.592
AND LEARN HOW TO BE A COWBOY.

14:14.636 --> 14:15.985
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

14:16.029 --> 14:16.725
WE COULD ACTUALLY USE
AN EXTRA HAND ON THE RANCH

14:16.768 --> 14:17.769
THIS WEEK.

14:17.813 --> 14:18.858
WELL, I TOLD HIM

14:18.901 --> 14:19.771
THIS WEEK
WAS ALL ABOUT FAMILY.

14:19.815 --> 14:20.947
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

14:20.990 --> 14:22.731
WHAT DO YOU SAY
YOU AND ME GO DOWNTOWN

14:22.774 --> 14:25.125
AND HAND OUT SOME FLYERS
FOR THE CHRISTMAS PARADE?

14:25.168 --> 14:26.256
I'LL EVEN SPRING
FOR DINNER AT THE PUB

14:26.300 --> 14:27.344
WHEN WE'RE DONE.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.520
AS EXCITING
AS THAT OFFER SOUNDS,

14:29.564 --> 14:30.913
ME AND UNCLE ROY STILL GOT
A LOT OF WORK WE'VE GOT TO DO

14:30.957 --> 14:32.262
BEFORE WE CAN CALL IT A DAY.

14:32.306 --> 14:35.918
WELL, I AM GOING TO GO
GET CLEANED UP.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.267
YOU LET ME KNOW
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.878
SOUNDS GOOD.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.189
AH!

14:46.233 --> 14:48.061
-HEY, SARAH!
-FIONA!

14:48.104 --> 14:49.062
I HEARD
YOU WERE BACK IN TOWN!

14:49.105 --> 14:50.063
-MERRY CHRISTMAS.
-THANKS.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.934
SO, HAVE YOU
GRADUATED YET?

14:51.978 --> 14:52.935

14:52.979 --> 14:53.893

STUDYING AGAIN?

14:53.936 --> 14:55.764
BUSINESS,
ALTHOUGH THESE DAYS,

14:55.807 --> 14:57.809
I FEEL LIKE I'M MAJORING
IN CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.507
-IT LOOKS AMAZING.
-THANKS.

14:59.550 --> 15:00.638
WOULD YOU MIND
PUTTING ONE OF THESE UP

15:00.682 --> 15:01.683
IN YOUR WINDOW?

15:01.726 --> 15:02.640
FOR THE CHRISTMAS PARADE?

15:02.684 --> 15:03.772
I THOUGHT THAT WAS CANCELED.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.208
NO, WE ARE BACK ON.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.385
CAN I GET
A TABLE FOR ONE?

THIS TOWN IS VERY FRIENDLY.

15:47.511 --> 15:48.643
YEAH.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.297
I'M ACTUALLY JUST HOME
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.602
I LIVE IN NEW YORK.

15:51.646 --> 15:52.995
OH! OKAY.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.954
YOU'RE FROM NEW YORK.
I CAN CUT TO THE CHASE.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.314
AND PLUS...

16:07.357 --> 16:08.271
I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF THE HOLIDAYS.

16:08.315 --> 16:10.534
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.493
I'VE GOT TWO CHRISTMAS
EGGNOGS FOR YOU BOTH.

16:12.536 --> 16:13.494
OH, DEAR,

16:15.409 --> 16:16.323
THANK YOU.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.243

EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW

16:34.341 --> 16:35.385
ABOUT RANCH LIFE?

16:35.429 --> 16:37.692

HE'S A RANCH HAND.

16:37.735 --> 16:38.867
PRIMARILY DEALS WITH HORSES.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.912
HE'S WILLFUL.
HE'S HONEST.

16:40.956 --> 16:41.696
HE'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

16:44.046 --> 16:47.136

REAL RANCH WORK IS HARD.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.398
I'M UP FOR IT.
COME ON.

16:48.442 --> 16:49.747
LOOK, I'VE GOT...

16:49.791 --> 16:51.445
I DO MY OWN STUNTS.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.664
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE
PRIMA DONNA ACTOR BOYS

16:53.708 --> 16:55.101
WHO, YOU KNOW, DOESN'T WANT
TO GET HIS HANDS DIRTY.

16:55.144 --> 16:58.017
COME ON...

16:58.060 --> 17:01.194
OKAY, WELL,
IF YOU'RE UP FOR IT,

17:01.237 --> 17:03.457
MY FAMILY COULD USE SOME HELP.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.676
LET ME CALL MY UNCLE ROY

17:05.720 --> 17:06.895
AND SEE IF HE'D BE WILLING
TO TAKE YOU ON AS A GUEST.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.072
OUTSTANDING.
OOH!

17:10.116 --> 17:11.595
THEY'VE GOT FRENCH TOAST.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.381
OKAY, SO,
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

17:14.424 --> 17:15.730
YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME LEARN

17:15.773 --> 17:17.775
EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT RANCHERS' LIFE,

17:17.819 --> 17:19.777
AND IN RETURN, I'M GOING
TO HELP YOU DECORATE

17:19.821 --> 17:21.127
FOR THE CHRISTMAS DAY PARADE?

17:21.170 --> 17:21.823
DON'T FORGET ABOUT
THE TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY.

17:21.866 --> 17:22.911
RIGHT.

17:22.954 --> 17:23.912
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:23.955 --> 17:25.131
MAYBE PUT A PIN
IN THAT FOR NOW,

17:25.174 --> 17:26.871
BUT MY UNCLE SAYS THAT
YOU CAN STAY WITH US

17:26.915 --> 17:29.222
AS LONG AS YOU PULL
YOUR OWN WEIGHT.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.267
SOUNDS
LIKE A DEAL, SARAH.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.617
I WILL SEE YOU
BRIGHT AND EARLY,

17:33.661 --> 17:35.054
AND IF YOU WANT
TO BE A REAL COWBOY,

17:35.097 --> 17:36.751
START BY LOSING
THE $800 BOOTS,

17:36.794 --> 17:38.753
UNLESS YOU WANT
$800 BLISTERS.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.239
I LIKE MY BOOTS.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.154
THEY'RE 1,200 BUCKS.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.132
OKAY.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.829
ENJOY YOUR LITTLE
RANCH ADVENTURE.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.135
I'M GOING TO HEAD
BACK TO CIVILIZATION

18:13.179 --> 18:15.485
WHERE I BELONG/

18:15.529 --> 18:16.834
BE CAREFUL,
YOU HEAR ME?

18:16.878 --> 18:18.009
I MEAN IT.
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.054
YOU GOT IT, BOSS.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.273
GOOD MORNING.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.448
GOOD MORNING.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.189
SO, AS FAR AS
ACCOMMODATIONS,

18:23.232 --> 18:24.103
WE HAVE A COUPLE
OF BEAUTIFUL CABINS

18:24.146 --> 18:25.321
DOWN IN THE SOUTH END

18:25.365 --> 18:26.540
WHERE WE USUALLY
PUT GUESTS.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.802
YEAH, I SAW THOSE
ON YOUR WEBSITE.

18:27.845 --> 18:28.672
YES, WELL,

18:28.716 --> 18:29.891
SINCE YOU SAID
YOU WANTED

18:29.934 --> 18:31.197
THE AUTHENTIC
EXPERIENCE,

18:31.240 --> 18:32.633
I FIGURED YOU COULD
STAY IN HERE.

18:32.676 --> 18:33.634
HERE?

18:33.677 --> 18:34.635
YEAH.

18:34.678 --> 18:36.027
THIS?

18:36.071 --> 18:37.116
OF COURSE, YEAH,
THIS MAKES SENSE.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.247
YOU'RE PLAYING
A RANCH HAND, RIGHT?

18:38.291 --> 18:40.684
ABSOLUTELY.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.178
THERE'S WOOD IN THE CORNER
BY THE STOVE.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.397
SHOULD KEEP YOU WARM ENOUGH,

18:57.440 --> 18:59.747
AND ALL THE MEALS
ARE AT THE MAIN HOUSE.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.489
OKAY.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.620
UM...

19:03.664 --> 19:04.708
IS THERE...

19:04.752 --> 19:07.276
IS THERE ANYTHING
TO DO AT NIGHT?

19:07.320 --> 19:09.583
UH, YOU COULD SIT ON THE PORCH
AND NAME THE COYOTES.

19:11.976 --> 19:14.370
OH.
YOU'RE... YOU'RE SERIOUS.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.242
WORKDAY STARTS
IN 30 MINUTES.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.504
I'LL SEE YOU OUT THERE.

19:17.547 --> 19:18.461
YES, MA'AM.

19:42.398 --> 19:43.965
-HEY.
-HEY.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.923
GOT YOUR NEW GUEST
ALL SETTLED IN AND HAPPY?

19:45.967 --> 19:47.229
SETTLED, YES.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.318
HAPPY?
IN THE BUNK HOUSE?

19:50.885 --> 19:52.278
WELL, I'D TAKE HIM AROUND,

19:52.321 --> 19:53.540
BUT I'VE GOT A LUMBER AND FEED
DELIVERY THIS MORNING.

19:53.583 --> 19:56.804
NO, I KNOW YOU'VE GOT
A LOT ON YOUR PLATE.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.980
UM, CODY, WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO TAKE A BREAK?

19:59.023 --> 20:00.416
PROBABLY NOT FOR A WHILE

20:00.460 --> 20:01.374
WITH ALL THE GUESTS
WE HAVE COMING,

20:01.417 --> 20:02.679
AND THE NEW BARN
IN THE WORKS.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.681
BUT YOU'VE WANTED
TO GO TO CALIFORNIA FOREVER.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.248
I KNOW.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.206
MAYBE NEXT YEAR.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.296
AFTER AUNT BETH PASSED,

20:10.339 --> 20:11.297
UNCLE ROY JUST SEEMS
TO NEED ME AROUND HERE

20:11.340 --> 20:12.211
MORE THAN EVER
THESE DAYS.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.748
-HEY.
-HEY.

20:27.791 --> 20:30.707
BETH SURE LOVED THIS PLACE.

20:30.751 --> 20:33.406
YEAH, THE VIEW SURE DOES HAVE
A WAY OF PULLING YOU IN.

20:38.149 --> 20:39.107
I REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME

20:39.150 --> 20:40.151
SHE BROUGHT ME UP HERE

20:40.195 --> 20:42.328
FOR A CHRISTMAS EVE PICNIC.

20:42.371 --> 20:45.244
TURKEY SANDWICHES,
MULLED CIDER...

20:47.463 --> 20:49.770
I HUNG MISTLETOE
FROM THAT BRANCH RIGHT THERE.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.252
IT'S FUNNY...

20:53.295 --> 20:54.383
YOU DO SOMETHING
FOR A FEW YEARS,

20:54.427 --> 20:55.384
IT BECOMES A TRADITION.

20:57.212 --> 20:58.474
YOU MEAN
LIKE A CHRISTMAS PARADE

20:58.518 --> 21:00.346
OR A TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY?

21:00.389 --> 21:02.609
YEAH, I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING AT,

21:05.438 --> 21:06.569
I ALWAYS DID THE
TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY

21:06.613 --> 21:07.657
WITH BETH.

21:07.701 --> 21:08.832
IT'S JUST...
I DON'T KNOW.

21:08.876 --> 21:09.790
I JUST CAN'T SEE
DOING IT WITHOUT HER.

21:12.532 --> 21:13.968
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.322
CODY TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR FELLA IN NEW YORK.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.237
I'M SORRY TO HEAR
HOW IT ENDED.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.630
THANKS.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.765
I THINK
IT WAS PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.376
WELL, I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT...

21:30.419 --> 21:33.292
LOSING THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE
IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.

21:36.033 --> 21:39.385
THOUGH ERIC AND I...

21:39.428 --> 21:40.995
WE DIDN'T HAVE
WHAT YOU AND AUNT BETH HAD.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.697
SHOULD PROBABLY
GET THE DAY'S WORK STARTED

21:47.741 --> 21:49.830
WITH OUR NEW GUEST.

21:49.873 --> 21:50.961
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

22:04.671 --> 22:05.628
MORNING.

22:05.672 --> 22:08.196
HEY. GOOD MORNING.

22:08.239 --> 22:09.415
UH, SO I TOOK
YOUR ADVICE.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.807
I GOT SOME BETTER BOOTS.

22:12.026 --> 22:13.332
NICE.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.942
LET'S GET STARTED.

22:14.985 --> 22:15.986
THERE'S NOT A CHANCE
THAT WE CAN GET A LATTE,

22:16.030 --> 22:17.031
IS THERE,

22:17.074 --> 22:18.685
OR A CHOCOLATE DONUT?

22:18.728 --> 22:20.077
RULE NUMBER ONE
OF RANCH LIFE...

22:20.121 --> 22:21.078
WE EAT AFTER THE HORSES DO.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.558
OKAY.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.168
YOU GIVE THEM SOME FEED,
AND THEN THEY GET A TREAT.

22:24.212 --> 22:27.041
THAT MEANS A CARROT,
NOT A CHRISTMAS COOKIE.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.270
YOU KNOW, I WONDER
HOW MANY RANCH HANDS

22:39.314 --> 22:41.316
ACTUALLY LOST THEIR HANDS
DOING THIS.

22:42.491 --> 22:45.059
-GET IT? IT'S A JOKE.
-KEEP CHOPPING.

22:45.102 --> 22:48.497
I GUESS I'LL JUST CONSIDER THIS
COLORADO'S VERSION OF CROSS FIT.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.370
YOU JUST SIT THERE
AND WORK ON YOUR IPAD.

22:52.762 --> 22:53.894
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

22:53.937 --> 22:55.025
I AM WORKING ON
THE CHRISTMAS PARADE,

22:55.069 --> 22:56.375
WHICH IS NOW LESS THAN
SIX DAYS AWAY.

22:57.637 --> 22:58.638
IN FACT,
WHEN YOU'RE DONE HERE,

22:58.681 --> 22:59.726
WE NEED TO GO
INTO THE STABLE

22:59.769 --> 23:02.163
AND GET OUT
SOME OF THE ORNAMENTS.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.991
UH, THAT IS,
UNLESS YOU'RE AFRAID OF SPIDERS?

23:14.001 --> 23:16.003
MY AUNT'S CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS
FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.179
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GLAD WE GOT THAT DONE.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.223
DONE?

23:19.267 --> 23:20.399
NO, NO, NO, NO.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.225
THERE'S FIVE MORE BOXES
BACK THERE.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.449
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING
THAT YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS?

23:27.493 --> 23:29.799
RULE NUMBER TWO
OF RANCH LIFE...

23:29.843 --> 23:30.713
THE BOSS MAKES THE RULES.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.454
GET BACK THERE.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.934
UGH!

23:39.766 --> 23:41.550
OH, COME ON.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.556
ALWAYS SOMETHING BREAKING DOWN
AROUND HERE.

24:01.352 --> 24:02.310
MORNING, DELILAH.

24:02.353 --> 24:03.659
GOOD MORNING.

24:03.703 --> 24:04.834
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

24:04.878 --> 24:06.009
JUST PAYING
A LITTLE NEIGHBORLY VISIT,

24:06.053 --> 24:07.097
THAT'S ALL.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.535
AND CHECKING UP ON ME,
I PRESUME?

24:09.578 --> 24:10.884
I'M NOT CHECKING UP
ON ANYBODY ROY,

24:10.927 --> 24:12.407
BUT IF I WERE,

24:12.451 --> 24:14.017
I WOULD SAY THAT EVERY RANCH
IN THIS VALLEY

24:14.061 --> 24:15.497
IS DECORATED FOR CHRISTMAS,

24:15.541 --> 24:16.629
SO I DON'T SEE

24:16.672 --> 24:17.847
WHY YOURS SHOULD BE
SO BARE THIS YEAR...

24:17.891 --> 24:19.283
WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
DELILAH,

24:19.327 --> 24:21.547
I JUST WANT TO GET THROUGH
THIS CHRISTMAS QUIETLY.

24:21.590 --> 24:22.852
WHICH IS WHY
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.201
AND I APPRECIATE IT.

24:24.245 --> 24:25.812
YOU'RE WELCOME.

24:27.117 --> 24:28.771
WHATCHA GOT HERE?

24:28.815 --> 24:30.251
A LITTLE HOLIDAY GIFT
FOR YOU AND THE KIDS.

24:30.294 --> 24:31.470
OH, THANK YOU!

24:31.513 --> 24:32.471
LOOK, ROY...

24:32.514 --> 24:34.908
WE ALL MISS BETH,

24:34.951 --> 24:36.387
AND I ONLY MENTIONED
THE DECORATIONS

24:36.431 --> 24:37.606
BECAUSE SHE LOVED THEM
SO MUCH.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.522
I KNOW, I KNOW.

24:40.566 --> 24:41.828
WELL, THANKS FOR THE CUPCAKES,
DELILAH.

24:41.871 --> 24:43.090
YOU'RE WELCOME.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.439
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.962
AND MERRY CHRISTMAS
TO YOU, TOO.

25:02.762 --> 25:03.545
SO YOU JUST PUT ON THE BOW...

25:03.589 --> 25:05.460
AND THAT IS HOW YOU MAKE

25:05.504 --> 25:06.548
A ROCKY MOUNTAIN
CHRISTMAS WREATH.

25:06.592 --> 25:07.593
THERE WE GO.

25:07.636 --> 25:08.724
NOW WE JUST NEED
TO MAKE A DOZEN MORE

25:08.768 --> 25:09.682
FOR THE PARADE.

25:09.725 --> 25:10.813
A DOZEN?

25:10.857 --> 25:13.512
ARE YOU FORGETTING
OUR AGREEMENT?

25:13.555 --> 25:14.861
I TRAIN YOU
HOW TO BE A RANCH HAND,

25:14.904 --> 25:15.818
AND YOU HELP ME
WITH THE PARADE.

25:15.862 --> 25:16.863
AGREED?

25:16.906 --> 25:19.256
AGREED.
AGREED...

25:19.300 --> 25:21.476
BUT I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU...

25:21.520 --> 25:24.218
EVERY SQUARE INCH OF MY BODY
IS SORE.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.263
WELL, YOU SAID YOU WANTED
AN AUTHENTIC RANCH EXPERIENCE.

25:26.307 --> 25:27.482
YOU GOT IT.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.266
ALL RIGHT, SO,

25:29.310 --> 25:33.096
SINCE WE'RE GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER...

25:33.140 --> 25:34.445
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

25:34.489 --> 25:38.667
I HAVE ONLY DONE
ONE STUNT ON MY OWN,

25:38.711 --> 25:40.364
AND THAT WAS JUMPING
FROM A HELICOPTER

25:40.408 --> 25:41.888
THAT WAS HOVERING SEVEN FEET
OFF THE GROUND,

25:41.931 --> 25:44.064
AND WHEN I LANDED,

25:44.107 --> 25:45.979
I BUSTED MY TOE.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.720
WELL, I'M SURE
WHEN IT HIT THE BIG SCREEN,

25:47.763 --> 25:49.460
YOU STILL LOOKED PICTURE-PERFECT
DOING IT.

25:49.504 --> 25:50.723
YOU HAVE...

25:52.159 --> 25:53.377
GOT TO COME CLEAN.

25:53.421 --> 25:54.901
WHAT IS YOUR ISSUE WITH ACTORS?

25:58.905 --> 26:01.472
MY MOM IS AN ACTOR,

26:01.516 --> 26:04.084
IN JUST REGIONAL THEATER
AND STUFF,

26:04.127 --> 26:06.869
BUT SHE SPENT HER ENTIRE LIFE
CHASING THAT DREAM OF FAME.

26:08.828 --> 26:09.829
MY BROTHER AND I
GREW UP

26:09.872 --> 26:11.613
BEING DRAGGED ALL OVER THE PLACE

26:11.657 --> 26:14.703
FOR HER AUDITIONS
AND PERFORMANCES.

26:14.747 --> 26:17.663
THANKFULLY, SHE STARTED
LEAVING US HERE AT THE RANCH

26:17.706 --> 26:19.273
WITH MY UNCLE ROY
AND AUNT BETH.

26:19.316 --> 26:21.014
SO THEY TOOK YOU IN?

26:22.363 --> 26:24.495
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.628
MY DAD WAS NEVER REALLY
IN THE PICTURE,

26:26.672 --> 26:29.936
AND MY MOM'S CAREER
BECAME HER PRIORITY...

26:29.979 --> 26:31.154
AND ONE CHRISTMAS,

26:31.198 --> 26:32.416
WE DECIDED
IT WOULD BE BEST FOR ALL OF US

26:32.460 --> 26:34.462
IF CODY AND I JUST LIVED HERE
PERMANENTLY.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.292
THEY'RE LIKE PARENTS
TO CODY AND ME.

26:38.335 --> 26:39.510
HUH.

26:39.554 --> 26:42.470
YEAH, THAT WOULD TURN ME OFF
ACTORS, TOO.

26:46.213 --> 26:48.955
THERE'S ACTUALLY
ONE MORE REASON

26:48.998 --> 26:50.086
FOR MY AVERSION TO ACTORS.

26:51.871 --> 26:54.134
MY EX JUST DUMPED ME FOR ONE.

26:55.352 --> 26:56.310
LISA TAYLOR.

26:56.353 --> 26:57.311
WHAT?

26:58.704 --> 26:59.661
HOLD ON A SECOND.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.794
YOU'RE THAT SARAH...

27:01.837 --> 27:02.664
YOU'RE THAT SARAH MCKINNEY?

27:02.708 --> 27:03.709
YUP.

27:03.752 --> 27:04.884
THAT'S INSANE.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.712
YOU'RE ALL OVER THE TABLOIDS
RIGHT NOW.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.757
YEAH.

27:08.801 --> 27:11.325
LIKE, THE COUNTRY
RUNS ON GOSSIP.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.153
DO WE HAVE NOTHING BETTER
TO TALK ABOUT?

27:13.196 --> 27:14.328
NO. AND THEY THINK

27:14.371 --> 27:16.243
I'M DATING MY CO-STAR,
NICOLE COLLINS,

27:16.286 --> 27:17.287
WHICH...

27:17.331 --> 27:19.333
-ARE YOU?
-NO.

27:19.376 --> 27:20.508
NO. IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

27:20.551 --> 27:21.814
THEY HAVE TO FEED
THE RUMOR BEAST.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.946
JUST LAUGH IT OFF,

27:23.990 --> 27:25.382
BECAUSE, BEFORE
YOU KNOW IT,

27:25.426 --> 27:26.427
THEY'LL BE TALKING
ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE.

27:29.256 --> 27:30.300
EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

27:30.344 --> 27:31.737
I KNOW.

27:33.216 --> 27:34.348
WELL...

27:34.391 --> 27:35.741
AN EXCELLENT SECOND DAY
AT THE RANCH.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.221
WE CAN HEAD INTO THE TOWN
THIS AFTERNOON,

27:38.265 --> 27:39.353
PICK UP SOME MORE SUPPLIES.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.051
UM...

27:42.095 --> 27:43.705
THANK YOU...

27:43.749 --> 27:45.011
FOR YOUR HELP WITH THE WREATH.

27:45.054 --> 27:46.708
YEAH. YEAH, OF COURSE.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.188
THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME
HOW TO MAKE 'EM.

27:53.193 --> 27:54.324
HOW'D IT GO?

27:54.368 --> 27:56.457
HE'S PRETTY GREEN,
BUT HE HELD HIS OWN.

27:57.719 --> 27:58.807
WHAT'S UP?

28:00.417 --> 28:01.462
I FOUND THESE

28:01.505 --> 28:03.377
UNDER SOME FILES
IN THE OFFICE.

28:03.420 --> 28:04.726
WHAT IS IT?

28:04.770 --> 28:05.771
REAL ESTATE COMPS

28:05.814 --> 28:09.383
FOR OTHER RANCHES
IN THE AREA.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.211
I THINK UNCLE ROY
WANTS TO SELL THE RANCH.

28:28.358 --> 28:30.230
HERE WE ARE.

28:30.273 --> 28:31.753
SO, UM, I'M GOING
TO MEET UP WITH PAIGE

28:31.797 --> 28:33.494
TO HANG UP
THE REST OF THESE CANDY CANES.

28:33.537 --> 28:34.451
YOU'VE GOT SOME ERRANDS.

28:34.495 --> 28:35.844
MEET ME IN AN HOUR?

28:35.888 --> 28:36.802
YEAH. SEE YOU IN AN HOUR.

28:36.845 --> 28:37.803
BYE.

28:41.807 --> 28:44.026
HOW'S YOUR UNCLE DOING?

28:44.070 --> 28:45.724
HE'S GOOD.

28:46.812 --> 28:47.943
DID I TELL YOU
THAT CODY THINKS

28:47.987 --> 28:49.075
THAT HE WANTS
TO SELL THE RANCH?

28:49.118 --> 28:50.903
NO, YOU'RE KIDDING!

28:50.946 --> 28:52.034
DID YOU ASK HIM
ABOUT IT?

28:52.078 --> 28:54.384
HONESTLY,
I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE.

28:54.428 --> 28:56.865
SARAH, YOU CAN'T
LET HIM SELL IT.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.345
I KNOW...

28:58.388 --> 29:00.390
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I MOVED AWAY YEARS AGO,

29:00.434 --> 29:02.436
AND IT'S HIS PLACE,

29:02.479 --> 29:04.960
SO WHO AM I TO TELL HIM
THAT HE CAN'T SELL IT?

29:05.004 --> 29:07.049
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I JUST...

29:07.093 --> 29:08.616
I KNOW HOW MUCH
THAT PLACE MEANS TO YOU.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.923
RIBBON?

29:13.708 --> 29:16.798
SO, HOW IS YOUR RANCHER-
IN-TRAINING COMING ALONG?

29:16.842 --> 29:18.452
UH... I HAVE TO ADMIT,

29:18.495 --> 29:19.975
HE'S DOING BETTER
THAN I THOUGHT HE WOULD.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.107
DO YOU LIKE HIM?

29:22.412 --> 29:23.762
HE'S NOT AS ANNOYING
AS I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE.

29:26.155 --> 29:27.461
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM...

29:27.504 --> 29:29.506
I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT.

29:29.550 --> 29:31.030
I JUST GET THE FEELING

29:31.073 --> 29:32.118
THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON
HIDING OUT THIS CHRISTMAS.

29:33.293 --> 29:34.598
ANYWAY,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

29:34.642 --> 29:35.774
I'VE GOT BIGGER FISH
TO FRY.

29:37.079 --> 29:39.386
ONLY YOU,
SARAH MCKINNEY,

29:39.429 --> 29:41.649
WOULD SUGGEST
THAT GRAHAM MITCHELL

29:41.692 --> 29:42.606
IS A SMALL FISH.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.007
HI!

29:52.051 --> 29:53.792
YEAH, OF COURSE.
ABSOLUTELY.

29:54.836 --> 29:55.837
GOOD, YOU GOT IT.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.013
OKAY, HERE,
TAKE A FLYER.

29:58.057 --> 29:59.232
COME TO THE PARADE.

29:59.275 --> 30:00.624
HEY, BROTHER.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.279
GOOD, YOU GOT IT.
HERE, TAKE SOME FLYERS.

30:03.323 --> 30:04.977
PASS 'EM OUT.
FOUR DAYS AWAY.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.326
BIGGEST PARADE EVER.

30:06.369 --> 30:07.370
I HAVE TO ADMIT,

30:07.414 --> 30:08.676
YOUR CELEBRITY
IS NOT EXACTLY HURTING

30:08.719 --> 30:10.765
THE PROMOTION
OF THIS PARADE.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.941
THANK YOU FOR BEING
SUCH A GOOD SPORT.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.073
YOU'RE WELCOME.

30:14.116 --> 30:15.552
I'M JUST GOING
TO FILE THIS

30:15.596 --> 30:17.467
IN THE CATEGORY OF DOING
WHAT THE RANCH BOSS SAYS.

30:17.511 --> 30:18.991
OH, WISE DECISION.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.557
OKAY,
SO WE HAVE FOUR DAYS

30:20.601 --> 30:21.689
TO PUT TOGETHER A PARADE

30:21.732 --> 30:22.733
THAT UNTIL
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO

30:22.777 --> 30:24.518
WAS CONSIDERED CANCELED.

30:24.561 --> 30:25.954
YOU KNOW,
I'VE GOT TO SAY,

30:25.998 --> 30:26.912
YOU HAVE A KNACK FOR THIS.

30:26.955 --> 30:28.652
I'M IMPRESSED.

30:28.696 --> 30:29.958
THANK YOU.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.264
I JUST REALIZED
I NEVER TOLD YOU

30:31.307 --> 30:32.178
WHAT IT IS THAT I DO.

30:32.221 --> 30:33.440
NO, WHAT DO YOU DO?

30:33.483 --> 30:35.094
I'M AN INTERIOR DESIGNER

30:35.137 --> 30:37.096
AT A HOTEL CHAIN
BACK IN NEW YORK,

30:37.139 --> 30:38.662
SO MAKING CHRISTMASES
CHRISTMAS-Y

30:38.706 --> 30:39.750
IS PART OF
WHAT I DO.

30:39.794 --> 30:40.795
IT'S WHAT YOU DO.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.884
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO SAY,

30:42.928 --> 30:43.885
I GUESS
THIS IS KIND OF SIMILAR

30:43.929 --> 30:45.234
TO MAKING MOVIES,

30:45.278 --> 30:46.801
YOU KNOW, PUTTING
ON A CHRISTMAS PARADE.

30:46.845 --> 30:47.802
YOU NEED COSTUMES.
YOU NEED PROPS.

30:47.846 --> 30:48.890
THERE'S MUSIC.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.152
GOT TO HAVE
GOOD WORD-OF-MOUTH.

30:52.067 --> 30:55.810
OKAY, THAT GENUINELY
SURPRISES ME.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.464
I THOUGHT THAT THIS
TOWN WOULD BE TOO SMALL

30:57.507 --> 31:00.467
TO HAVE A BELL-RINGING
SANTA CLAUS.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.685
HEY, THIS TOWN
MAY BE SMALL,

31:01.729 --> 31:04.123
BUT WE ARE BIG ON
CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

31:04.166 --> 31:05.167
COME ON,
I DON'T GET YOU.

31:05.211 --> 31:06.995
YOU DON'T LIKE
CHRISTMAS CAROLS.

31:07.039 --> 31:08.910
YOU WORK STRAIGHT
THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.172
HOW CAN ANY ONE PERSON

31:10.216 --> 31:12.348
BE SO IMPERVIOUS
TO CHRISTMAS MAGIC?

31:12.392 --> 31:14.307
I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE MY REASONS.

31:14.350 --> 31:15.786
YOU WORK IN A LAND
OF MAKE-BELIEVE.

31:15.830 --> 31:16.787
COULD YOU AT LEAST PRETEND

31:16.831 --> 31:18.093
TO HAVE
THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT?

31:18.137 --> 31:19.703
FINE. I'LL TRY.

31:19.747 --> 31:21.749
YOU GREW UP HERE?

31:21.792 --> 31:23.403
I DID, AND I LOVED
EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

31:25.492 --> 31:26.841
THIS HAS ALWAYS
BEEN HOME TO ME.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.582
HERE.

31:28.625 --> 31:29.844
PUT THESE ON.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.454
OH, NO...

31:31.498 --> 31:32.847
NO, YOUR HANDS,
THEY LOOK COLD.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.632
THEY'RE WHITE
WITH COLD, SO...

31:35.676 --> 31:37.678
PLUS, I'VE GOT TO GET
MY HANDS USED TO THE COLD.

31:39.245 --> 31:40.550
SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE
ATTRACTED QUITE A CROWD.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.858
HI.

31:43.902 --> 31:44.946
ALL RIGHT.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.600
I'M GOING TO PUT
THESE GUYS TO WORK.

31:46.643 --> 31:47.514
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:47.557 --> 31:48.515
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

31:48.558 --> 31:49.559
PHIL.

31:49.603 --> 31:50.560
HEY, PHIL.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.214
GRAHAM.

31:52.258 --> 31:53.563
DO YOU MIND
TAKING A BREAK?

31:53.607 --> 31:54.956
FOR JUST, LIKE, TEN
MINUTES, YOU GO INSIDE,

31:55.000 --> 31:56.262
GET SOME HOT
CHOCOLATE, WARM UP?

31:56.305 --> 31:57.219
OH, WELL, UH...

31:57.263 --> 31:58.351
PHIL...

31:58.394 --> 32:00.614
I CAN VOUCH
FOR THIS CHARACTER.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.703
WELL, OKAY, SARAH.
THANK YOU...

32:02.746 --> 32:03.965
AND, UH...

32:04.009 --> 32:05.053
THANK YOU, YOUNG MAN.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.794
OF COURSE.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, PHIL.

32:06.837 --> 32:07.751
-MERRY CHRISTMAS.
-TEN MINUTES!

32:07.795 --> 32:10.189
GIVE ME TEN MINUTES.

32:11.538 --> 32:12.539
COME ON, EVERYBODY!

32:12.582 --> 32:16.021
COME ON,
MAKE SOME DONATIONS!

32:16.064 --> 32:17.805
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

32:17.848 --> 32:18.849
HEY, GUYS, REMEMBER,

32:18.893 --> 32:20.329
CHRISTMAS PARADE
IN FOUR DAYS.

32:20.373 --> 32:21.330
IT IS GOING TO BE
THE BIGGEST PARADE

32:21.374 --> 32:23.028
THIS TOWN HAS EVER SEEN.

32:23.071 --> 32:25.682
FOUR DAYS AWAY.

32:25.726 --> 32:29.382
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

32:29.425 --> 32:30.470
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

32:37.216 --> 32:38.608
WHAT YOU DID OUT THERE
WAS PRETTY GREAT.

32:38.652 --> 32:41.002
YOU RAISED $380
IN 20 MINUTES,

32:41.046 --> 32:42.264
AND NO,
I AM NOT COUNTING

32:42.308 --> 32:43.613
THE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL
THAT YOU PUT IN.

32:43.657 --> 32:44.658
AH, YOU SAW THAT?

32:44.701 --> 32:45.833
YEAH.

32:45.876 --> 32:46.660
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT CAN I SAY?

32:48.662 --> 32:50.229
GUESS I GOT CARRIED AWAY
WITH THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.015
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'D WANT TO VOLUNTEER

32:54.059 --> 32:55.843
TO BE THE GRAND MARSHAL
AT THE CHRISTMAS PARADE?

32:58.063 --> 32:59.151
I THINK IT'S ONE THING

32:59.194 --> 33:01.370
TO BE CHRISTMAS-Y
FOR A MINUTE,

33:01.414 --> 33:02.371
BUT THEN...

33:02.415 --> 33:03.720
RIGHT. YEAH.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.374
THAT WAS DUMB.
SORRY.

33:05.418 --> 33:07.159
NO, IT'S...

33:12.077 --> 33:14.296
I THINK I'M GOING TO HEAD
BACK TO MY BUNKHOUSE.

33:14.340 --> 33:15.994
OH.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.821
GOOD NIGHT.

33:17.865 --> 33:21.564
UM, THERE IS...
ONE RANCH TRADITION

33:21.608 --> 33:22.739
THAT WE HAVEN'T COVERED YET.

33:22.783 --> 33:23.958
WHAT'S THAT?

33:24.002 --> 33:26.134
WANT TO HELP ME CUT DOWN
A CHRISTMAS TREE?

33:27.309 --> 33:28.267
RIGHT NOW?

33:28.310 --> 33:29.442
YEAH.

33:29.485 --> 33:30.269
YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT
'TIL THE MORNING?

33:31.357 --> 33:32.923
NO.

33:32.967 --> 33:33.881
THERE'S A FULL MOON.

33:35.230 --> 33:36.318
YES.

33:36.362 --> 33:37.754
GRAB YOUR SAW.
COME ON, COWBOY.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.713
AH, YES, MA'AM.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.637
WOW.

33:53.248 --> 33:57.078
THIS WAS MY AUNT AND UNCLE'S
FAVORITE PLACE.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.211
HE PROPOSED TO HER
ONE CHRISTMAS EVE

33:59.254 --> 34:01.082
RIGHT ON THIS VERY SPOT.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.649
THEY MUST HAVE HAD
SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL.

34:02.692 --> 34:04.520
THEY DID.

34:06.131 --> 34:09.047
THIS WHOLE RANCH IS SPECIAL.

34:09.090 --> 34:10.265
YOU KNOW,
EVEN WHEN I'M BACK IN NEW YORK,

34:10.309 --> 34:12.702
JUST KNOWING IT EXISTS...

34:12.746 --> 34:14.574
ALL THE HAPPY MEMORIES
I HAVE HERE...

34:24.497 --> 34:25.759
GRAHAM, CAN I
ASK YOU SOMETHING?

34:25.802 --> 34:26.586
YEAH, SURE.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.852
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'RE AVOIDING THIS CHRISTMAS?

34:36.117 --> 34:37.945
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU
EVEN THINK THAT?

34:37.988 --> 34:41.601
WELL, I HAPPEN TO KNOW A THING
OR TWO ABOUT AVOIDANCE.

34:41.644 --> 34:42.819
I MEAN, I'M THE ONE

34:42.863 --> 34:44.299
WHO HAD TO TRAVEL
A COUPLE THOUSAND MILES

34:44.343 --> 34:45.909
JUST TO AVOID OUR OWN BREAKUP.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.175
UM...

34:55.832 --> 34:57.269
ALL RIGHT, SO THE TRUTH IS,

34:57.312 --> 34:58.705
MY FILM DOESN'T START SHOOTING
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS,

34:58.748 --> 35:00.924
AND, UH...

35:00.968 --> 35:02.622
I JUST HAD NOWHERE TO BE
FOR CHRISTMAS,

35:02.665 --> 35:04.885
SO THE TIMING WAS...

35:04.928 --> 35:05.929
GOOD.

35:08.410 --> 35:09.281
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

35:09.324 --> 35:11.109
MM.

35:14.677 --> 35:17.245
I LOST MY FOLKS
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

35:17.289 --> 35:18.681
AND I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN
EVER SINCE,

35:18.725 --> 35:21.293
AND SO, UH...

35:23.295 --> 35:25.601
AND, UM...

35:25.645 --> 35:27.255
CHRISTMAS TIME
IS A REALLY ROUGH SEASON FOR ME.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.518
YOU KNOW?

35:29.562 --> 35:31.781
IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL
ALL ALONE,

35:31.825 --> 35:33.000
SO THE MORE I WORK,
THE LESS IT HURTS.

35:35.481 --> 35:36.438
I'M SO SORRY.

35:36.482 --> 35:37.439
DON'T BE SORRY.

35:37.483 --> 35:40.268
I HAVE...

35:40.312 --> 35:42.488
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
AT CHRISTMAS.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.144
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME,
CHRISTMAS TIME IS...

35:50.235 --> 35:51.975
YOU KNOW, IT'S MORE OF A TIME
TO BE ENDURED THAN ENJOYED...

35:53.368 --> 35:54.674
BUT, UH,
LAST YEAR,

35:54.717 --> 35:56.502
I WAS IN BARBADOS,

35:56.545 --> 35:59.461
AND...

35:59.505 --> 36:01.420
NEXT YEAR?

36:04.466 --> 36:05.337
WHO KNOWS.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.733
WELL...

36:10.777 --> 36:11.647
LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE BOTH HIDING OUT

36:11.691 --> 36:12.779
THIS CHRISTMAS.

36:12.822 --> 36:15.521
YEAH, LOOKS THAT WAY.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.656
: YOU KNOW...

36:20.700 --> 36:23.093
SINCE YOU'VE MISSED OUT
ON SO MANY CHRISTMASES,

36:23.137 --> 36:24.225
SEEMS ONLY FAIR

36:24.269 --> 36:26.227
THAT YOU GET TO PICK
THE TREE THIS YEAR.

36:26.271 --> 36:27.620
ME?

36:27.663 --> 36:28.838
YEAH.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.451
GO FOR IT.

36:41.111 --> 36:44.202
HUH.
WHAT ABOUT...

36:46.291 --> 36:49.511
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

36:49.555 --> 36:50.730
NICE NEEDLES...

36:50.773 --> 36:51.731
STRONG BRANCHES...

36:53.472 --> 36:55.300
IT'S A GOOD, DEPENDABLE TREE.

36:55.343 --> 36:57.215
I THINK
WE'VE FOUND OUR TREE.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.485
Y'ALL PICKED
A GREAT ONE.

37:06.528 --> 37:07.703
GRAHAM CHOSE IT.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.923
WE.
WE CHOSE IT.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.106
WHO PUT THAT TREE
IN MY LIVING ROOM?

37:20.499 --> 37:21.587
DELILAH?
WAS IT YOU?

37:21.630 --> 37:23.153
NO, I JUST STOPPED BY

37:23.197 --> 37:24.807
TO DROP OFF SOME
CHRISTMAS COOKIES.

37:24.851 --> 37:26.374
AND I WAS JUST
STARTING THE FIRE.

37:26.418 --> 37:27.984
LOOK, UNCLE ROY,

37:28.028 --> 37:29.072
I JUST WANTED TO...

37:29.116 --> 37:30.726
IT WAS MY FAULT, SIR.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.162
ALL DUE RESPECT,
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING

37:32.206 --> 37:33.729
TO KEEP THINGS
LOW-KEY THIS YEAR,

37:33.773 --> 37:34.948
BUT I SAW THIS TREE,

37:34.991 --> 37:36.166
AND I JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD LOOK PERFECT

37:36.210 --> 37:37.124
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM,

37:37.167 --> 37:39.605
BUT...

37:39.648 --> 37:41.824
I THINK IT WOULD LOOK
EVEN MORE PERFECT

37:41.868 --> 37:42.695
IF IT WERE DECORATED.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.221
SON, YOU CAN SAVE
THAT HUNDRED-DOLLAR SMILE

37:47.265 --> 37:48.222
FOR YOUR FANS.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.659
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST GUY

37:50.703 --> 37:52.139
WHO'S TRIED TO SELL ME
THE SAME HORSE TWICE...

37:53.358 --> 37:55.534
BUT...

37:55.577 --> 37:58.101
AROUND HERE, HOSPITALITY COMES
WITH THE TERRITORY,

37:58.145 --> 38:00.539
SO, UH...

38:00.582 --> 38:01.540
SUIT YOURSELVES.

38:03.498 --> 38:04.412
WANT TO HELP
US DECORATE?

38:04.456 --> 38:08.155
NO, I'M GOING TO TURN IN.

38:08.198 --> 38:10.810
YOU COULD FIND BETH'S ORNAMENTS
IN THE CLOSET IN THE HALLWAY.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.597
GOOD NIGHT.

38:15.641 --> 38:16.816
GOOD NIGHT.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.296
GOOD NIGHT.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.911
THAT'S A LOT TO ASK OF HIM
RIGHT NOW.

38:24.954 --> 38:26.956
MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL
JUST GIVE HIM

38:27.000 --> 38:28.044
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

38:28.088 --> 38:29.307
SURE.

38:31.483 --> 38:32.875
THANK YOU.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.747
YOU'RE WELCOME.

38:42.276 --> 38:45.192
UH-OH.
I NEED HELP.

38:45.235 --> 38:47.107
LOOKS LIKE I HAVE
A MOVIE STAR TO RESCUE.

38:57.117 --> 38:58.161
OH, THAT'S PRETTY.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.601
PUT IT UP?

39:02.644 --> 39:03.819
SURE.

39:26.581 --> 39:28.409
JOSEPHINE!
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

39:28.453 --> 39:31.107
MERRY CHRISTMAS YOURSELF.

39:31.151 --> 39:32.979
HOW ARE THINGS IN COLORADO?

39:33.022 --> 39:34.328
ARE YOU GETTING
THE R&R YOU WANTED?

39:34.372 --> 39:35.895
HAH...

39:35.938 --> 39:37.418
NOT EXACTLY,

39:37.462 --> 39:39.638
BUT I AM DOING
WHAT I DO BEST...

39:39.681 --> 39:41.204
STAYING BUSY.

39:41.248 --> 39:43.250
HOW ARE THINGS
BACK AT THE HOTEL?

39:43.293 --> 39:44.294
OH...

39:44.338 --> 39:45.295
YOUR LOBBY'S SUCH A HIT.

39:45.339 --> 39:46.775
JACOBS CAN'T WAIT TO SEE

39:46.819 --> 39:48.342
WHAT YOU HAVE PLANNED
FOR NEW YEAR'S.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.299
HE WONDERED
IF YOU COULD COME BACK

39:49.343 --> 39:50.300
A DAY EARLY

39:50.344 --> 39:51.214
TO GET A JUMP START?

39:52.172 --> 39:53.913
UM...

39:53.956 --> 39:56.306
I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

39:56.350 --> 39:59.179
IN THE MEANTIME,
I HAVE A PARADE TO PLAN.

39:59.222 --> 40:01.268
TELL EVERYONE AT THE HOTEL
I SAY HI.

40:01.311 --> 40:02.748
BYE, JO.

40:05.185 --> 40:07.013
MORNING!

40:07.056 --> 40:07.927
MORNING.

40:07.970 --> 40:08.754
YOU'RE UP
AWFULLY EARLY.

40:08.797 --> 40:10.538
READY TO HEAD
DOWNTOWN

40:10.582 --> 40:12.018
AND DECORATE MAIN STREET?

40:12.061 --> 40:14.673
THERE IS NOTHING
I WOULD RATHER DO

40:14.716 --> 40:15.630
THAN GO DECORATE MAIN STREET.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.023
OH.

40:17.066 --> 40:18.285
UH...

40:18.328 --> 40:20.069
WHY DO YOU HAVE
A SNOWBALL IN YOUR HAND?

40:20.113 --> 40:21.201
UH, WELL,

40:21.244 --> 40:22.507
THIS WAS GOING TO BE
YOUR WAKE-UP CALL

40:22.550 --> 40:23.421
IF YOU WEREN'T UP YET.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.206
SEEMS A SHAME TO WASTE

40:26.249 --> 40:27.512
SUCH A PERFECTLY
GOOD SNOWBALL.

40:27.555 --> 40:28.426
REALLY?

40:29.818 --> 40:31.472
OKAY.
THAT'S IT.

40:32.821 --> 40:33.953
I COULDN'T RESIST.

40:35.258 --> 40:37.130
OKAY.

40:37.173 --> 40:38.436
AH!

40:38.479 --> 40:39.306
TRUCE, TRUCE,
TRUCE, TRUCE.

40:39.349 --> 40:41.700
TRUCE.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.615
OH...

40:46.356 --> 40:47.575
YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:47.619 --> 40:48.663
I CALLED A TRUCE.

40:48.707 --> 40:49.838
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T
AGREE TO IT.

40:49.882 --> 40:52.145
AND YOU SAID YOU
CAN'T TRUST AN ACTOR.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.326
HI, GRAHAM.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.461
NICOLE! HI.

41:10.555 --> 41:11.817
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

41:11.860 --> 41:12.992
WELL, YOU'D KNOW

41:13.035 --> 41:14.297
IF YOU EVER CHECKED
YOUR PHONE, SILLY!

41:14.341 --> 41:15.603
HA.

41:15.647 --> 41:17.779
UM...
THIS IS...

41:17.823 --> 41:20.565
I'M NICOLE COLLINS,
GRAHAM'S CO-STAR.

41:20.608 --> 41:22.262
AND THIS IS...

41:22.305 --> 41:23.611
SARAH.

41:23.655 --> 41:25.570
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, SARAH.

41:25.613 --> 41:27.006
PETER TOLD ME ALL
ABOUT YOUR RANCH.

41:27.049 --> 41:28.268
HE SAID THAT I'D BE

41:28.311 --> 41:29.443
IN VERY CAPABLE
HANDS HERE.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.618
WHOA, WAIT.
ARE YOU STAYING HERE?

41:30.662 --> 41:31.924
IF THAT'S OKAY.

41:31.967 --> 41:33.665
I FIGURED, SINCE WE'RE
BOTH IN THE SAME FILM,

41:33.708 --> 41:35.362
I SHOULD
PROBABLY LEARN

41:35.405 --> 41:38.060
ABOUT RANCH LIFE,
TOO, RIGHT?

41:38.104 --> 41:39.366
YOU WANT TO LEARN
HOW TO BE A RANCH HAND?

41:39.409 --> 41:40.454
I JUST FIGURED

41:40.498 --> 41:41.629
I'D LEARN MY LINES
WITH GRAHAM

41:41.673 --> 41:43.675
AND ABSORB ALL THE
ATMOSPHERE HERE...

41:43.718 --> 41:45.590
AND THEN WE CAN SPEND
CHRISTMAS TOGETHER.

41:45.633 --> 41:46.765
I'VE MISSED YOU.

41:46.808 --> 41:48.897
HUH... HEH.
'KAY.

41:48.941 --> 41:50.246
YOU HAVE TO CATCH ME UP...

41:50.290 --> 41:51.204
ON EVERYTHING.

41:51.247 --> 41:52.858
YEAH.

41:52.901 --> 41:54.294
I'M JUST GOING TO...

41:54.337 --> 41:55.687
IT WAS A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, SARAH.

41:55.730 --> 41:57.079
I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

41:57.123 --> 41:58.428
YEAH, ME...
ME TOO.

41:58.472 --> 42:00.387
YOU HAVE BAGS?

42:00.430 --> 42:01.649
YEAH, LOTS
OF BAGS.

42:12.573 --> 42:13.400
HEY.

42:13.443 --> 42:14.706
HEY.

42:14.749 --> 42:15.837
UM...

42:15.881 --> 42:18.318
SORRY ABOUT NICOLE.

42:18.361 --> 42:19.232
I HAD NO IDEA THAT
SHE WAS COMING.

42:19.275 --> 42:20.755
IT'S FINE.

42:20.799 --> 42:21.974
SHE SEEMS NICE.

42:22.017 --> 42:24.280
YEAH, SHE IS.
SHE'S GREAT, BUT...

42:24.324 --> 42:26.152
GRAHAM... IT'S FINE.

42:26.195 --> 42:28.894
YOU DON'T NEED
TO EXPLAIN.

42:28.937 --> 42:30.504
I'M JUST HAPPY
WHEN THE GUESTS ARE HAPPY.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.114
OKAY.

42:32.158 --> 42:33.812
CAN SOMEBODY
PLEASE TELL ME

42:33.855 --> 42:36.118
WHY NICOLE COLLINS
IS OUT ON OUR PORCH?

42:36.162 --> 42:38.164
SHE'S OUR NEW GUEST.

42:38.207 --> 42:40.166
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

42:40.209 --> 42:41.341
UM....

42:41.384 --> 42:42.472
CAN'T SWING A LASSO

42:42.516 --> 42:43.561
WITHOUT HITTING
A MOVIE STAR THESE DAYS.

42:43.604 --> 42:44.779
YOU KNOW,
ACTUALLY,

42:44.823 --> 42:45.650
SHE'S NOT GOING
TO BE STAYING HERE.

42:45.693 --> 42:46.694
WHY NOT?

42:46.738 --> 42:47.826
WELL, I
EXPLAINED TO HER

42:47.869 --> 42:49.001
THAT YOU GUYS
AREN'T REALLY OPEN.

42:49.044 --> 42:50.002
THE RANCH IS CLOSED
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

42:50.045 --> 42:52.439
I CAN HELP SHOW HER
AROUND...

42:52.482 --> 42:53.614
I MEAN,
ONLY IF THAT WOULD BE USEFUL.

42:53.658 --> 42:54.702
NO.

42:54.746 --> 42:55.616
NO, IT'LL BE OKAY.
THANKS, THOUGH.

42:55.660 --> 42:57.313
THAT'S FINE.

42:57.357 --> 42:58.880
THERE'S AN EXTRA ROOM
IN THE MAIN HOUSE.

42:58.924 --> 42:59.751
I'LL GO GET IT SET IT UP.

43:25.690 --> 43:26.691
HEY, YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

43:26.734 --> 43:28.736
OF COURSE.

43:28.780 --> 43:29.824
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN DOING DOUBLE-DUTY

43:29.868 --> 43:31.304
WITH GRAHAM AND THE PARADE,

43:31.347 --> 43:32.566
SO IT'S GOOD.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.133
NOW I CAN JUST FOCUS
ON THE PARADE FULL-TIME.

43:34.176 --> 43:37.615
IF YOU SAY SO.

43:37.658 --> 43:39.399
YOU KNOW, I THINK
YOU SHOULD REALLY MAYBE TRY

43:39.442 --> 43:41.096
TAKING IT A BIT EASIER
ON YOURSELF.

43:41.140 --> 43:42.184
I'M FINE.

43:42.228 --> 43:43.838
YOU SAID IT BEST.

43:43.882 --> 43:46.493
IT'S BEST FOR ME
TO JUST KEEP BUSY.

43:48.408 --> 43:49.496
WELL,
I CAN KEEP YOU CAFFEINATED.

43:49.539 --> 43:51.411
THANK YOU.

43:51.454 --> 43:52.891
PROMISE ME YOU'LL BE CAREFUL
ON THAT LADDER.

43:52.934 --> 43:53.935
OKAY?

43:53.979 --> 43:54.936
I WILL.

44:37.936 --> 44:40.286
TO SPRUCE UP THE ROTARY GUYS

44:56.519 --> 44:58.304
AND THE TREES...

44:58.347 --> 45:00.523
I DO.

45:00.567 --> 45:02.612
GOT A LOT OF MEMORIES
AT THIS RANCH.

45:02.656 --> 45:04.614
IT'S PARTLY
WHY I'M HERE.

45:04.658 --> 45:05.615
FIGURED MAYBE
IF THINGS WORK OUT

45:05.659 --> 45:06.747
BETWEEN GRAHAM AND ME,

45:06.791 --> 45:07.574
WE CAN MAKE A FEW
CHRISTMAS MEMORIES

45:07.617 --> 45:09.054
OF OUR OWN.

45:09.097 --> 45:10.838
PERFECT PLACE FOR IT.

45:10.882 --> 45:11.883
OH, REALLY?

45:11.926 --> 45:13.232
YEAH.
US DATING...

45:13.275 --> 45:14.146
IT WAS ORIGINALLY
JUST A PUBLICITY SET-UP,

45:14.189 --> 45:15.060
YOU KNOW.

45:16.931 --> 45:18.324
THEY ACTUALLY...
THEY DO THAT?

45:18.367 --> 45:20.500
SURE.

45:20.543 --> 45:22.458
OUR PUBLICISTS THOUGHT
WE LOOKED GOOD TOGETHER,

45:22.502 --> 45:23.546
SO WE WENT
ALONG WITH IT,

45:23.590 --> 45:24.547
I WAS SURPRISED

45:24.591 --> 45:25.374
AT WHAT A NICE GUY
GRAHAM WAS,

45:25.418 --> 45:27.942
BUT, UH... UNFORTUNATELY,

45:27.986 --> 45:29.683
WE'VE BOTH BEEN
SO BUSY WITH OUR CAREERS,

45:29.727 --> 45:30.858
THE WHOLE THING
NEVER REALLY WENT ANYWHERE.

45:30.902 --> 45:32.991
OH, YEAH?

45:33.034 --> 45:35.123
I FIGURE THIS MOVIE'S
A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

45:35.167 --> 45:36.255
TO GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

45:38.344 --> 45:40.607
AND YOU'VE ALL BEEN
SO WELCOMING HERE.

45:40.650 --> 45:41.608
LET ME KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP.

45:46.874 --> 45:49.224
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE ACTUALLY IS.

45:49.268 --> 45:50.922
CODY HAS ALWAYS DREAMED

45:50.965 --> 45:54.273
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, BEING,
LIKE, A STUNT GUY

45:54.316 --> 45:55.970
WHO WORKS WITH HORSES.

45:56.014 --> 45:57.711
DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD...

45:57.755 --> 45:58.494
TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT?

45:58.538 --> 45:59.713
YEAH.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.628
SURE.

46:01.671 --> 46:02.585
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

46:04.500 --> 46:05.371
THANK YOU.

46:05.414 --> 46:06.589
YEAH.

46:13.988 --> 46:15.076
HEY.

46:15.120 --> 46:15.860
HEY, UNCLE ROY.

46:15.903 --> 46:18.253
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

46:18.297 --> 46:19.689
I JUST FIGURED IF THE HORSES
WERE GOING TO BE IN THE PARADE,

46:19.733 --> 46:20.603
THEY MIGHT AS WELL
LOOK THE PART.

46:20.647 --> 46:22.518
JUST LIKE YOUR AUNT--

46:22.562 --> 46:25.043
ALWAYS FIGURING OUT A WAY
TO DECORATE THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

46:25.086 --> 46:26.653
SHE WAS THE BEST AT IT.

46:26.696 --> 46:27.959
YES, SHE WAS.

46:29.917 --> 46:31.353
YOU OKAY?

46:31.397 --> 46:33.051
YEAH, FINE. WHY?

46:33.094 --> 46:34.269
I DON'T KNOW.

46:34.313 --> 46:35.793
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
THERE MUST BE A REASON

46:35.836 --> 46:36.837
WHY YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
YOUR FINGERS TO THE BONE LATELY.

46:36.881 --> 46:38.404
THAT OBVIOUS, HUH?

46:38.447 --> 46:39.666
MM-HMM.

46:41.233 --> 46:42.277
IT'S BEEN TOUGH...

46:43.583 --> 46:44.932
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED THIS YEAR.

46:46.151 --> 46:48.109
SEEMS LIKE AS SOON AS
THINGS CALM DOWN,

46:48.153 --> 46:49.589
ANOTHER STORM MOVES IN.

46:51.286 --> 46:52.418
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,

46:52.461 --> 46:53.506
THERE'S ALWAYS SUNSHINE
AFTER A STORM.

46:55.595 --> 46:57.771
SOMETIMES, YOU'VE JUST GOTTA BE
A LITTLE BIT PATIENT.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.468
SO...

46:59.512 --> 47:01.122
HANG IN THERE, OKAY?

47:01.166 --> 47:02.123
THANKS.

47:04.343 --> 47:05.692
YOU KNOW,

47:05.735 --> 47:07.781
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER
TAKING IT EASY YOURSELF.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.217
SURE THE BARN CAN WAIT
UNTIL THE NEW YEAR.

47:09.261 --> 47:11.829
UNFORTUNATELY, IT CAN'T.

47:24.493 --> 47:26.321
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

47:26.365 --> 47:27.453
OH, UM,

47:27.496 --> 47:28.497
MY AUNT BETH ALWAYS SAID

47:28.541 --> 47:30.935
THE CHRISTMAS PARADE
RAN ON SWEETS.

47:30.978 --> 47:33.459
HER, UM,
PEPPERMINT BARK RECIPE

47:33.502 --> 47:35.504
WAS ALWAYS MY FAVORITE.

47:35.548 --> 47:38.290
OKAY, YOU NEED TO
STOP AVOIDING ME.

47:38.333 --> 47:39.465
WE NEED TO TALK.

47:39.508 --> 47:40.466
UM...

47:41.989 --> 47:43.121
JUST IF YOU'RE GOING TO STEAL,
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP, SO...

47:43.164 --> 47:44.513
FINE.

47:50.084 --> 47:51.912
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT NICOLE?

47:51.956 --> 47:52.826
WHAT'S THERE
TO TALK ABOUT?

47:52.870 --> 47:54.697
WELL...

47:54.741 --> 47:58.092
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN MOVIE RELATIONSHIPS

47:58.136 --> 47:59.789
AND REAL RELATIONSHIPS.

47:59.833 --> 48:01.139
YEAH, I KNOW.

48:01.182 --> 48:02.575
NICOLE TOLD ME IT STARTED
AS A PUBLICITY STUNT.

48:02.618 --> 48:04.316
WHAT, WHAT STARTED?
A RUMOR?

48:05.578 --> 48:07.101
GRAHAM, YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO L.A. IN A FEW DAYS,

48:07.145 --> 48:08.581
AND I AM GOING BACK
TO NEW YORK.

48:08.624 --> 48:10.278
MAYBE SO,
AND MAYBE I CAME HERE

48:10.322 --> 48:12.193
TO LOSE MYSELF
AT CHRISTMAS TIME,

48:12.237 --> 48:15.893
BUT I DID NOT EXPECT
TO FIND YOU.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.071
GRAHAM, READY TO RUN OUR SCENE?

48:20.114 --> 48:22.160
HEY, NICOLE.

48:22.203 --> 48:23.509
OH, UM...

48:23.552 --> 48:25.598
I'VE GOT TO HEAD TO TOWN
WHILE YOU GUYS WORK,

48:25.641 --> 48:27.252
SO... SEE YOU LATER.

48:29.558 --> 48:30.385
HEY.

48:30.429 --> 48:31.778
HEY.

48:36.435 --> 48:37.523
HELLO.

48:37.566 --> 48:38.437
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

48:38.480 --> 48:39.742
HI, IS ROY AROUND?

48:39.786 --> 48:40.918
UH, NO, HE'S NOT.

48:40.961 --> 48:42.180
IS THERE ANYTHING
I COULD HELP YOU WITH?

48:42.223 --> 48:43.572
UH, THAT'S OKAY.

48:43.616 --> 48:45.183
JUST HAVE HIM GIVE ME A CALL
WHEN HE GETS BACK.

48:45.226 --> 48:48.055
SURE, CAN I TELL HIM
WHAT IT'S ABOUT?

48:48.099 --> 48:49.404
JUST TELL HIM
I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS.

48:49.448 --> 48:50.362
I HAVE A CLIENT
THAT'S READY TO MAKE AN OFFER.

48:51.798 --> 48:53.365
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

48:53.408 --> 48:55.715
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

49:06.769 --> 49:09.685
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN'T DO?

49:09.729 --> 49:11.122
YOU KNOW, I LOVE
ROY AND CODY,

49:11.165 --> 49:13.385
BUT I'VE OFTEN
IMAGINED

49:13.428 --> 49:14.516
HOW DIFFERENT THAT
RANCH WOULD LOOK

49:14.560 --> 49:16.779
IF YOU EVER DECIDED
TO RETURN HOME.

49:16.823 --> 49:18.477
PAIGE, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T DO THAT.

49:18.520 --> 49:19.957
MY LIFE IS
IN NEW YORK NOW.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.959
I KNOW, BUT A GIRL
CAN DREAM, RIGHT?

49:23.525 --> 49:24.744
HOW IS THAT MOVIE STAR?

49:24.787 --> 49:26.789
ANY CHRISTMAS MAGIC
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

49:26.833 --> 49:30.184
I DO NOT HAVE TIME
TO THINK ABOUT GRAHAM.

49:30.228 --> 49:31.446
I HAVE ENOUGH GOING ON.

49:33.753 --> 49:36.756
BESIDES, WHO WANTS TO
BE WITH AN ACTOR, RIGHT?

49:36.799 --> 49:39.454
I MEAN,
THEY'RE ENTITLED,

49:39.498 --> 49:42.849
AND HAVE TO BE
IN THE SPOTLIGHT,

49:42.892 --> 49:45.373
AND THEY ARE
ALWAYS LEAVING.

49:45.417 --> 49:47.419
SO HE IS GUILTY
BY ASSOCIATION?

49:47.462 --> 49:49.290
NO.

49:49.334 --> 49:50.509
I MEAN, IN A WEEK,

49:50.552 --> 49:51.945
WE'LL BE
3,000 MILES APART,

49:51.989 --> 49:53.468
AND WE'LL PROBABLY NEVER
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.

49:53.512 --> 49:54.904
OKAY, THAT'S
OPTIMISTIC.

49:54.948 --> 49:57.342
NO, IT'S REALISTIC...

49:57.385 --> 49:58.430
AND BESIDES,

49:58.473 --> 49:59.866
HE'S GOT THIS,
YOU KNOW,

49:59.909 --> 50:01.085
GORGEOUS
HOLLYWOOD CO-STAR.

50:01.128 --> 50:02.303
SHE FOLLOWED HIM
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE.

50:02.347 --> 50:04.131
SHE'D...

50:04.175 --> 50:05.480
SHE'D PROBABLY MARRY HIM
IN A HEARTBEAT.

50:05.524 --> 50:06.525
OKAY, NOW, SARAH,

50:06.568 --> 50:08.657
YOU'RE JUST MAKING
ASSUMPTIONS.

50:08.701 --> 50:10.137
NO, PAIGE.

50:10.181 --> 50:12.226
I'VE BEEN DOWN
THIS ROAD BEFORE,

50:12.270 --> 50:13.880
AND I AM NOT
DOING IT AGAIN.

50:17.101 --> 50:19.712
YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU CAME HERE

50:19.755 --> 50:21.279
TO HIDE OUT
WHILE THINGS SETTLED DOWN,

50:21.322 --> 50:22.976
AND I AM REALLY GLAD YOU DID,

50:23.020 --> 50:25.326
BUT AT SOME POINT,
YOU'RE GOING TO REALIZE

50:25.370 --> 50:29.113
THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN HIDING OUT,

50:29.156 --> 50:30.027
AND JUST PLAIN HIDING.

50:50.134 --> 50:51.135
MORNING.

50:51.178 --> 50:52.614
MORNING!
SLEEP WELL?

50:52.658 --> 50:54.051
YEAH.

50:54.094 --> 50:55.008
UM...

50:55.052 --> 50:56.227
SO, UNCLE ROY,

50:56.270 --> 50:58.272
A REAL ESTATE AGENT
STOPPED BY LAST NIGHT.

50:58.316 --> 50:59.230
JENNY SOMEONE?

51:00.840 --> 51:01.754
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

51:03.016 --> 51:04.061
SHE SAID
SHE HAS AN OFFER FOR YOU.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.716
ARE YOU GOING
TO SELL THE RANCH?

51:07.760 --> 51:10.241
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE MAKING
A NEW BARN?

51:11.764 --> 51:14.027
WELL, NOTHING'S FINAL YET,

51:14.071 --> 51:16.160
BUT THINGS CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS
MUCH LONGER.

51:16.203 --> 51:17.509
BUT WHY?

51:17.552 --> 51:18.727
I THOUGHT
WE WERE DOING OKAY.

51:18.771 --> 51:20.642
WELL, I...

51:20.686 --> 51:23.123
I SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY
TO RUN THIS PLACE ANYMORE,

51:23.167 --> 51:25.386
AND IT'S JUST
NOT THE SAME

51:25.430 --> 51:26.518
WITHOUT YOUR AUNT.

51:26.561 --> 51:27.910
WE ALL MISS HER,
UNCLE ROY,

51:27.954 --> 51:29.651
BUT, HECK,
I'LL HELP YOU RUN THE RANCH.

51:29.695 --> 51:30.783
I'VE PRETTY MUCH BEEN
DOING IT ANYWAY.

51:30.826 --> 51:32.045
YES,
YES, YOU HAVE,

51:32.089 --> 51:33.177
AND YOU'RE STARTING
TO RESENT IT.

51:33.220 --> 51:34.265
NAH...

51:34.308 --> 51:36.397
NO, DON'T DENY IT.

51:36.441 --> 51:37.833
ANYBODY CAN SEE

51:37.877 --> 51:39.052
THAT YOU'RE ITCHING
TO GET OUT THERE INTO THE WORLD.

51:39.096 --> 51:40.793
-YES, BUT I...
-AND SARAH--

51:40.836 --> 51:42.316
YOU'RE HEADING BACK
TO MANHATTAN SOON, SO...

51:42.360 --> 51:44.231
BUT UNCLE ROY,
THIS IS OUR HOME.

51:44.275 --> 51:45.841
NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT,
HONEY, I DO...

51:45.885 --> 51:46.973
AND WHEREVER I END UP,

51:47.016 --> 51:47.930
THAT'LL BE
YOUR HOME, TOO.

51:47.974 --> 51:49.149
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE WELCOME,

51:49.193 --> 51:50.933
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

51:50.977 --> 51:53.588
THIS PLACE IS GETTING
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE,

51:53.632 --> 51:54.807
AND, I MEAN,

51:54.850 --> 51:56.591
WE BARELY BROKE EVEN
THE LAST TWO YEARS.

51:56.635 --> 51:57.853
YEAH, BUT...

51:57.897 --> 51:58.898
THERE'S NO BUTS
ABOUT IT!

51:58.941 --> 52:00.421
THERE'S NO BUTS ABOUT IT.

52:00.465 --> 52:03.598
THIS PLACE'LL TAKE EVERY CHOICE
YOU GUYS HAVE IN LIFE,

52:03.642 --> 52:05.861
AND IT'S GOING TO WHITTLE IT
DOWN TO JUST ONE,

52:05.905 --> 52:08.603
AND I DON'T WANT TO SADDLE
EITHER OF YOU WITH THAT.

52:08.647 --> 52:10.910
OKAY?

52:10.953 --> 52:11.867
NOW, LOOK,
LIKE IT OR NOT,

52:11.911 --> 52:13.869
WE GOT GUESTS HERE,

52:13.913 --> 52:16.002
SO LET'S GIVE THEM
THE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY EXPECT.

52:16.045 --> 52:17.264
OKAY?

52:21.355 --> 52:22.835
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, NICOLE?

52:22.878 --> 52:23.792
NICE RIDING, GRAHAM!

52:25.403 --> 52:26.317
YOU BOTH LOOK GREAT.

52:28.275 --> 52:29.450
ANYWAY, I'VE GOT TO HEAD
INTO TOWN

52:29.494 --> 52:31.235
ON SOME OFFICIAL
PARADE BUSINESS, SO...

52:31.278 --> 52:32.758
I'M GOING TO GO
WITH YOU, HANG ON.

52:32.801 --> 52:34.847
UH, I DON'T NEED
ANY HELP.

52:45.597 --> 52:47.425
ALL RIGHT,
TOO BAD.

52:47.468 --> 52:48.513
UH...

52:48.556 --> 52:49.427
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.

52:50.732 --> 52:52.169
FINE.

52:52.212 --> 52:55.084
I JUST HAVE TO GO DOWN
TO THE LOCAL RADIO STATION

52:55.128 --> 52:56.390
AND TALK ABOUT
THE PARADE

52:56.434 --> 52:57.957
AND BEG FOR MORE
VOLUNTEERS,

52:58.000 --> 52:59.001
'CAUSE WE PROBABLY NEED

52:59.045 --> 52:59.785
ABOUT TWO DOZEN MORE
ON THE DAY.

52:59.828 --> 53:00.873
OKAY, WELL,

53:00.916 --> 53:01.830
IF YOU WANT ME
TO GO WITH YOU

53:01.874 --> 53:02.875
TO THE RADIO STATION,

53:02.918 --> 53:04.006
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE BEEN KNOWN

53:04.050 --> 53:05.138
TO DO A LITTLE PRESS
HERE AND THERE.

53:06.487 --> 53:07.793
I THINK I CAN HANDLE
THE LOCAL DJ.

53:07.836 --> 53:10.361
OKAY.

53:10.404 --> 53:12.145
BUT IF YOU INSIST
ON HELPING,

53:12.189 --> 53:13.538
YOU COULD RUN
TO THE STORE FOR ME

53:13.581 --> 53:14.930
AND PICK UP SOME MORE
RIBBON FOR THE WREATHS.

53:14.974 --> 53:16.367
WOULD BE MY PLEASURE,
MA'AM.

53:20.414 --> 53:22.155
I WILL SAY THIS
ABOUT LIFE ON A RANCH.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.026
AFTER ALL THE WORK'S
DONE AROUND HERE,

53:24.070 --> 53:26.246
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT TO DO.

53:26.290 --> 53:29.206
YEAH, CAN'T ARGUE
WITH YOU THERE.

53:29.249 --> 53:30.119
I COULD TAKE YOU
INTO TOWN LATER,

53:30.163 --> 53:32.252
IF YOU PREFER...

53:32.296 --> 53:34.036
OR...

53:34.080 --> 53:35.168
I COULD SHOW YOU HOW WE DO
CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS

53:35.212 --> 53:37.301
ON A RANCH.

53:37.344 --> 53:38.432
YOU TAKE ONE OF THESE,

53:38.476 --> 53:39.955
JUST ADD A LITTLE
GREEN AND RED PAINT,

53:39.999 --> 53:41.957
A SNOWFLAKE,
SOME MISTLETOE,

53:42.001 --> 53:43.481
HANG IT
ON THE FIREPLACE,

53:43.524 --> 53:46.092
GOT YOURSELF
A CHRISTMAS COUNTRY STOCKING.

53:46.135 --> 53:47.572
THAT IS ADORABLE!

53:47.615 --> 53:49.138
YEAH, YOU GET CREATIVE

53:49.182 --> 53:50.531
WHEN YOU'RE OUT HERE
AS MUCH AS I AM.

53:50.575 --> 53:52.838
SARAH SAID YOU'RE QUITE
THE MOVIE BUFF.

53:52.881 --> 53:54.840
WESTERN FILMS,
MOSTLY.

53:54.883 --> 53:56.276
SHE ALSO MENTIONED
YOU WERE INTERESTED

53:56.320 --> 53:57.669
IN MAYBE DOING
SOME STUNT WORK ONE DAY?

53:57.712 --> 53:59.410
THAT'S SILLY,
I KNOW.

54:03.675 --> 54:05.546
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A DREAM
OF WORKING IN THE MOVIES.

54:07.896 --> 54:09.289
I ALMOST MOVED TO
CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR,

54:09.333 --> 54:11.291
AND THEN AUNT BETH GOT SICK,

54:11.335 --> 54:13.554
AND, YOU KNOW,
I COULDN'T LEAVE THEN.

54:13.598 --> 54:14.642
SINCE SHE PASSED,

54:14.686 --> 54:15.861
ROY'S NEEDED ME
AROUND HERE

54:15.904 --> 54:16.775
MORE THAN EVER,

54:16.818 --> 54:17.906
SO HERE I AM.

54:19.125 --> 54:20.169
SORRY, CODY.

54:20.213 --> 54:21.432
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

54:21.475 --> 54:24.217
NOW THAT ROY'S DETERMINED
TO SELL THE RANCH,

54:24.261 --> 54:27.307
I MIGHT GET MY CHANCE
SOONER THAN I THINK.

54:27.351 --> 54:30.179
IF YOU DO
MAKE IT TO L.A.,

54:30.223 --> 54:32.356
I COULD INTRODUCE YOU
TO OUR STUNT COORDINATOR.

54:32.399 --> 54:33.922
REALLY?

54:33.966 --> 54:36.098
THAT'S...

54:36.142 --> 54:38.318
THANK YOU, NICOLE.

54:38.362 --> 54:40.059
AND WITH CHRISTMAS
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS,

54:40.102 --> 54:44.890
ROCK CREEK'S ANNUAL PARADE
IS BACK ON,

54:44.933 --> 54:47.849
AND A NEW ORGANIZER
THIS YEAR, SARAH MCKINNEY,

54:47.893 --> 54:49.024
IS HERE WITH US
TO TELL US ALL ABOUT IT.

54:49.068 --> 54:50.199
HI, SARAH.

54:50.243 --> 54:51.462
HI!

54:51.505 --> 54:54.987
UM, YES, THE PARADE
IS DEFINITELY BACK ON,

54:55.030 --> 54:57.381
AND IT IS VERY SPECIAL
FOR ME THIS YEAR

54:57.424 --> 55:00.775
BECAUSE WE'LL BE HAVING IT
IN HONOR OF MY AUNT BETH,

55:00.819 --> 55:03.474
WHO WAS THE ORGANIZER
FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS.

55:03.517 --> 55:05.345
HOWEVER, THIS YEAR,

55:05.389 --> 55:06.955
WE ARE IN DESPERATE NEED
FOR VOLUNTEERS,

55:06.999 --> 55:08.914
SO IF ANYONE OUT THERE
IS INTERESTED,

55:08.957 --> 55:10.176
YOU CAN GO DOWN
TO THE HARVEST CAFE

55:10.219 --> 55:11.525
AND ASK FOR PAIGE.

55:11.569 --> 55:14.485
AND WHO'S GOING
TO BE MARCHING THIS YEAR?

55:14.528 --> 55:16.661
WELL,
WE HAVE THE, UH...

55:16.704 --> 55:17.618
THE HIGH SCHOOL BAND,

55:17.662 --> 55:18.793
AND, UM...

55:18.837 --> 55:21.143
THE ROTARY CLUB,

55:21.187 --> 55:23.363
AND SOME PEOPLE
FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

55:23.407 --> 55:24.495
ANY FLOATS?

55:24.538 --> 55:27.976
MY KIDS JUST LOVE
THOSE FLOATS.

55:28.020 --> 55:29.151
YEAH, WELL,

55:29.195 --> 55:30.979
WE GOT A BIT OF A LATE START
THIS YEAR,

55:31.023 --> 55:33.547
SO, UM, WE HAVEN'T MADE
AN OFFICIAL DECISION

55:33.591 --> 55:35.593
ABOUT THE FLOATS YET.

55:35.636 --> 55:38.509
WORD AROUND TOWN
IS THAT AFTERWARDS,

55:38.552 --> 55:40.119
THERE WON'T BE
A TREE-LIGHTING

55:40.162 --> 55:41.990
AT YOUR FAMILY RANCH
THIS YEAR?

55:42.034 --> 55:43.949
UM, NO,

55:43.992 --> 55:46.865
BUT, UM...

55:46.908 --> 55:49.476
WE'RE-- WE'RE STILL HOPING
FOR A GREAT TURNOUT,

55:49.520 --> 55:50.782
AND, UH...

55:50.825 --> 55:52.523
UM...

56:02.924 --> 56:05.536
UH, THE ONE AND ONLY
GRAHAM MITCHELL...

56:05.579 --> 56:06.580
HI THERE.

56:06.624 --> 56:09.148
HAS JUST JOINED US
IN STUDIO.

56:09.191 --> 56:10.149
WELCOME, GRAHAM!

56:10.192 --> 56:11.237
WELCOME.

56:11.280 --> 56:12.369
AWESOME TO BE HERE.

56:12.412 --> 56:13.674
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR HAVING ME.

56:13.718 --> 56:15.154
UM, I JUST WANTED
TO STOP BY

56:15.197 --> 56:16.677
AND TELL YOU

56:16.721 --> 56:18.462
AND YOUR GREAT LISTENERS
OUT THERE IN ROCK CREEK

56:18.505 --> 56:20.942
THAT IF YOU LOVE CHRISTMAS
AS MUCH AS I DO,

56:20.986 --> 56:22.988
THEN THIS YEAR'S
CHRISTMAS PARADE

56:23.031 --> 56:24.468
IS NOT ONE TO BE MISSED,

56:24.511 --> 56:26.208
AND IN FACT,
I HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE ANNOUNCEMENT

56:26.252 --> 56:27.340
FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR LISTENERS.

56:27.384 --> 56:29.560
I'M WORKING
ON A FLOAT

56:29.603 --> 56:31.692
THAT I'M PRETTY SURE

56:31.736 --> 56:34.303
IS GOING TO BE...

56:34.347 --> 56:35.479
THE THING THAT EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT

56:35.522 --> 56:36.567
ON PARADE DAY,

56:36.610 --> 56:39.483
AND, TO TOP THAT,

56:39.526 --> 56:40.962
I HAVE ACCEPTED THE POSITION
OF GRAND MARSHAL

56:41.006 --> 56:43.530
FOR THE PARADE
THIS YEAR.

56:43.574 --> 56:46.011
WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT,
ROCK CREEK!

56:46.054 --> 56:48.100
YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST!

56:48.143 --> 56:50.842
GRAHAM MITCHELL HAS JUST TURNED
THIS YEAR'S PARADE

56:50.885 --> 56:54.411
INTO THE HOTTEST EVENT
OF THE YEAR!

56:54.454 --> 56:56.064
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

56:56.108 --> 56:58.545
YOU ARE LISTENING
TO KXJP 109.4,

56:58.589 --> 57:00.765
COLORADO'S
BEST COUNTRY STATION.

57:00.808 --> 57:02.288
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

57:02.331 --> 57:03.202
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

57:03.245 --> 57:04.464
THANK YOU.

57:04.508 --> 57:05.770
THANK YOU.

57:05.813 --> 57:07.598
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

57:18.086 --> 57:19.610
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS?

57:22.743 --> 57:25.833
IT'S MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S
OLD SLEIGH.

57:25.877 --> 57:27.574
IT'S SEEN BETTER DAYS.

57:29.533 --> 57:30.490
YOU KNOW, CODY AND I
USED TO PLAY IN THIS

57:30.534 --> 57:31.752
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

57:31.796 --> 57:33.537
WELL, YOU KNOW,

57:33.580 --> 57:36.496
I DID PROMISE
AT LEAST ONE FLOAT,

57:36.540 --> 57:37.584
SO I THINK

57:37.628 --> 57:42.110
IF WE CAN GET
THIS THING CLEANED UP...

57:42.154 --> 57:44.286
IT'LL LOOK A LOT LIKE
SANTA CLAUS'S SLEIGH.

57:44.330 --> 57:46.288
IT'S PERFECT.

58:43.998 --> 58:45.086
OH!

58:45.130 --> 58:46.740
SEE, I'M SORRY.
I MISSED.

58:46.784 --> 58:48.525
FIRST TAKE IS ALWAYS A BUST.

58:48.568 --> 58:50.831
IT'S MY SECOND TAKE.
THAT'S WHERE THE GENIUS IS.

58:50.875 --> 58:53.312
FEEL THE FLOW...

58:53.355 --> 58:54.226
LOOK AT THAT.

RIGHT?

58:55.227 --> 58:57.359
IT'S NICE.

58:57.403 --> 58:59.057
SOME VACATION
THIS HAS BEEN FOR YOU.

58:59.100 --> 59:00.058
ALL YOU'VE DONE IS WORK.

59:00.101 --> 59:01.146
SAME GOES FOR YOU,

59:01.189 --> 59:03.670
AND YOU KNOW,
I FEEL REALLY BADLY.

59:03.714 --> 59:06.064
I FEEL LIKE
YOU'VE JUST TAKEN ON A LOT,

59:06.107 --> 59:07.631
HOSTING NICOLE
AND I, AND I...

59:07.674 --> 59:08.893
I'D LIKE TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

59:10.634 --> 59:11.548
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

59:11.591 --> 59:13.201
WELL...

59:13.245 --> 59:14.899
CODY TOLD ME

59:14.942 --> 59:16.509
THAT YOUR UNCLE ROY IS THINKING
ABOUT SELLING THE RANCH.

59:19.033 --> 59:20.208
I'D LIKE TO CALL
MY BUSINESS MANAGER AND...

59:20.252 --> 59:22.036
LOOK, I APPRECIATE YOU
WANTING TO HELP...

59:22.080 --> 59:23.211
BUT WHAT?

59:25.649 --> 59:27.389
BUT THIS IS BETWEEN
MY UNCLE AND MY BROTHER AND ME,

59:27.433 --> 59:28.956
AND ONE WAY
OR ANOTHER,

59:29.000 --> 59:31.611
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT
OURSELVES.

59:31.655 --> 59:32.612
BESIDES...

59:32.656 --> 59:33.570
BESIDES WHAT?

59:35.702 --> 59:37.530
WE HAVE A PARADE
TO DELIVER...

59:37.574 --> 59:38.836
AND WE'RE NOT DONE DECORATING.

59:40.141 --> 59:41.055
YOU DID NOT JUST...

59:41.099 --> 59:42.883
DID YOU REALLY?

59:42.927 --> 59:44.058
NO, NO, NO!

59:45.582 --> 59:47.018
: AH! NO!

59:57.768 --> 59:58.812
: HEY!

59:58.856 --> 59:59.987
HEY.

1:00:00.031 --> 1:00:01.598
WE'RE GOING
TO HEAD INTO TOWN,

1:00:01.641 --> 1:00:02.773
DO A LITTLE
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.

1:00:02.816 --> 1:00:04.513
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
GO CHRISTMAS SHOPPING?

1:00:04.557 --> 1:00:05.776
UH, SINCE I FOUND OUT

1:00:05.819 --> 1:00:07.691
IT WAS HALF THE JOY
OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

1:00:07.734 --> 1:00:08.909
DO YOU WANT TO JOIN US?

1:00:08.953 --> 1:00:10.781
UH, NO, I SHOULD
PROBABLY STAY HERE.

1:00:10.824 --> 1:00:11.956
GOT TO MAKE A COUPLE
MORE OF THOSE WREATHS

1:00:11.999 --> 1:00:12.957
FOR THE LAMPPOSTS.

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:14.393
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU MEAN...

1:00:14.436 --> 1:00:15.307
HOLD ON.

1:00:22.314 --> 1:00:23.141
YOU MEAN
THESE WREATHS?

1:00:24.882 --> 1:00:25.883
BOOM.

1:00:27.319 --> 1:00:28.146
AND THERE ARE TEN MORE
JUST LIKE 'EM.

1:00:28.189 --> 1:00:29.147
WOW.

1:00:31.410 --> 1:00:32.803
SO YOU COMING, SARAH?

1:00:32.846 --> 1:00:34.108
COME ON,
IT'LL BE FUN.

1:00:36.371 --> 1:00:37.155
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE OUT OF EXCUSES.

1:00:39.026 --> 1:00:40.724
LET'S GO.

1:00:40.767 --> 1:00:42.334
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE

1:00:42.377 --> 1:00:44.118
FOR ALL OF THIS.

1:00:44.162 --> 1:00:45.293
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1:00:45.337 --> 1:00:46.338
HONESTLY,
AT FIRST,

1:00:46.381 --> 1:00:47.382
I WAS A LITTLE
OVERWHELMED,

1:00:47.426 --> 1:00:48.688
BUT THEN I STARTED
THINKING OF IT

1:00:48.732 --> 1:00:51.735
AS ONE BIG HOTEL LOBBY
TO DECORATE.

1:00:51.778 --> 1:00:53.127
YOU DID AN AMAZING JOB.

1:00:53.171 --> 1:00:54.346
WOW... SNOWMEN!

1:00:56.609 --> 1:00:58.132
I HAVEN'T BUILT ONE
SINCE I WAS A KID.

1:00:58.176 --> 1:00:59.699
WE SHOULD JOIN IN!

1:00:59.743 --> 1:01:01.048
SURE, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
WE MISSED THE DEADLINE.

1:01:01.092 --> 1:01:02.833
MM... HANG ON.

1:01:07.011 --> 1:01:08.490
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

1:01:08.534 --> 1:01:10.318
NICOLE HAS A WAY
OF WINNING PEOPLE OVER.

1:01:10.362 --> 1:01:12.712
SHE'S GOOD
AT USING THE CHARM CARD.

1:01:12.756 --> 1:01:13.931
RIGHT, AND YOU WOULD
NEVER DO THAT.

1:01:13.974 --> 1:01:15.367
WHO, ME?

1:01:17.021 --> 1:01:18.805
C'MON GUYS!
LET'S BUILD A SNOWMAN!

1:01:18.849 --> 1:01:20.372
SEE?

1:01:20.415 --> 1:01:21.590
-THANK YOU!
-THANK YOU.

1:01:21.634 --> 1:01:23.549
APPRECIATE IT.

1:01:23.592 --> 1:01:24.985
I HAVE TO SAY,

1:01:25.029 --> 1:01:26.117
YOU ARE PRETTY GOOD AT THIS
FOR A CALIFORNIA BOY.

1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:27.858
WELL, I HOPE SO.

1:01:27.901 --> 1:01:29.468
YOU KNOW, I...

1:01:29.511 --> 1:01:31.600
I TOOK A SCULPTING CLASS
FOR THIS FILM

1:01:31.644 --> 1:01:33.037
I SHOT A FEW YEARS AGO,

1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:34.865
SO IT'S...
IT'S FINALLY PAYING OFF.

1:01:37.998 --> 1:01:39.478
SURE SEEMS LIKE THINGS
COME EASY TO YOU.

1:01:39.521 --> 1:01:41.436
YEAH?

1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:42.873
IS THAT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE?

1:01:44.396 --> 1:01:46.311
EVERYTHING THAT I'VE EVER
REALLY CARED ABOUT,

1:01:46.354 --> 1:01:48.530
I HAD TO WORK
PRETTY HARD FOR.

1:01:48.574 --> 1:01:49.662
YOU KNOW, LIKE MY CAREER.

1:01:49.706 --> 1:01:52.578
SO I WENT
FROM DOING CAR COMMERCIALS

1:01:52.621 --> 1:01:55.407
TO GUEST SPOTS ON TV

1:01:55.450 --> 1:01:57.365
TO FEATURE FILMS...

1:01:59.498 --> 1:02:00.804
WHAT?

1:02:00.847 --> 1:02:02.196
AND THEN...

1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:03.589
OF COURSE...

1:02:05.243 --> 1:02:06.157
THERE'S YOU.

1:02:09.247 --> 1:02:10.944
YOU GUYS ALMOST
DONE OVER THERE?

1:02:10.988 --> 1:02:13.425
: UNCLE ROY
JUST TEXTED.

1:02:13.468 --> 1:02:14.731
DELILAH CAME OVER,

1:02:14.774 --> 1:02:15.993
AND SHE'S NOT LEAVING
UNTIL WE ALL HEAD HOME

1:02:16.036 --> 1:02:17.211
AND JOIN THEM
FOR HOT COCOA.

1:02:17.255 --> 1:02:18.560
WELL THEN, SHOOT.

1:02:18.604 --> 1:02:19.561
LET'S GO.

1:02:22.782 --> 1:02:24.349
THERE YOU GO.

1:02:24.392 --> 1:02:26.177
CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS,
OLD WEST STYLE...

1:02:26.220 --> 1:02:28.919
I LOVE THEM!

1:02:28.962 --> 1:02:30.442
SO SARAH,
WHAT'S THE WORD?

1:02:30.485 --> 1:02:32.270
WILL YOU BE READY
FOR THE PARADE TOMORROW NIGHT?

1:02:32.313 --> 1:02:34.185
SURPRISINGLY, YES.

1:02:34.228 --> 1:02:35.360
THANKS TO OUR NEW GRAND MARSHAL,

1:02:35.403 --> 1:02:36.927
WE HAD A SURGE
OF VOLUNTEERS.

1:02:36.970 --> 1:02:38.493
JUST DOING MY JOB.

1:02:38.537 --> 1:02:39.625
: AND...

1:02:39.668 --> 1:02:40.757
THAT'S NOT THE
ONLY GOOD NEWS.

1:02:42.323 --> 1:02:43.803
NICOLE PUT A CALL IN
TO HER PRODUCER,

1:02:43.847 --> 1:02:45.805
AND GOT ME
A JOB ON THE FILM.

1:02:45.849 --> 1:02:47.154
CODY, THAT'S AMAZING!

1:02:47.198 --> 1:02:48.808
CONGRATULATIONS!

1:03:31.764 --> 1:03:32.765
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO BUY ME ANYTHING.

1:03:32.809 --> 1:03:35.246
I DIDN'T BUY IT.
I MADE THIS FOR YOU.

1:03:35.289 --> 1:03:36.247
MY FREE TIME.

1:03:42.470 --> 1:03:43.515

1:03:55.788 --> 1:03:57.442
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

THE CHRISTMAS PARADE
IS HAPPENING.

1:03:58.530 --> 1:03:59.487
WE PULLED IT OFF.

1:03:59.531 --> 1:04:01.054
I KNOW!

1:04:01.098 --> 1:04:02.795
I MEAN, I WISH WE WERE DOING
THE TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY,

1:04:02.839 --> 1:04:05.363
BUT...
AT LEAST WE HAVE THE PARADE.

1:04:05.406 --> 1:04:06.320
HAVE YOU DECIDED
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR

SOMETHING VERY
CHRISTMAS-Y.

1:04:08.670 --> 1:04:10.324
THAT'S MY THOUGHT EXACTLY.

1:04:17.810 --> 1:04:19.768
HANG ON A SECOND.

1:04:19.812 --> 1:04:20.813
I'VE GOT TO GET THIS.

1:04:20.857 --> 1:04:22.336
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

1:04:23.685 --> 1:04:24.948
HEY.

1:04:24.991 --> 1:04:26.471
HEY, PETER.
HOW YOU DOING?

1:04:26.514 --> 1:04:27.907
COLD!

1:04:27.951 --> 1:04:28.952
I'M IN NEW YORK
RIGHT NOW.

1:04:28.995 --> 1:04:30.344
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S UP?

1:04:30.388 --> 1:04:31.737
WELL, LOOKS LIKE

1:04:31.780 --> 1:04:32.912
YOU BETTER START PACKING,
BUDDY.

1:04:32.956 --> 1:04:35.132
YOUR LITTLE RANCH ADVENTURE?

1:04:35.175 --> 1:04:37.003
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COMING
TO AN END.

1:04:37.047 --> 1:04:41.442
THE STUDIO NEEDS YOU AND NICOLE
FOR SOME ADVANCE PROMOTION.

1:04:41.486 --> 1:04:42.704
OKAY, WELL,

1:04:42.748 --> 1:04:43.662
I'LL GET ON A FLIGHT
RIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS.

1:04:43.705 --> 1:04:45.011
NO!
NO, NO, NO, NO.

1:04:45.055 --> 1:04:46.708
NO CAN DO, BUDDY.

1:04:46.752 --> 1:04:48.449
THEY NEED YOU GUYS THERE
TOMORROW.

1:04:48.493 --> 1:04:51.235
ALL RIGHT, THE STUDIO IS HOSTING A CHRISTMAS PARTY ON THE LOT.

1:04:51.278 --> 1:04:53.193
MARKETING NEEDS YOU THERE.

1:04:53.237 --> 1:04:55.543
THEY'RE TURNING IT
INTO A HUGE PRESS JUNKET,

1:04:55.587 --> 1:04:56.936
SO, YOU KNOW,

1:04:56.980 --> 1:04:58.895
THEY WANT TO SEE YOU AND NICOLE,
WALKING ARM-IN-ARM.

1:04:58.938 --> 1:05:02.246
SO, UH, BETTER COME HOME,
COWBOY.

1:05:14.954 --> 1:05:15.868
NICOLE, HI.

1:05:15.912 --> 1:05:17.783
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU.

1:05:17.826 --> 1:05:19.176
CODY IS OVER THE MOON.

1:05:19.219 --> 1:05:21.178
HEY, IT'S THE LEAST
I COULD DO.

1:05:22.396 --> 1:05:23.528
OH, ARE YOU PACKING ALREADY?

1:05:23.571 --> 1:05:25.312
YEAH, I'M HEADED
BACK TO L.A. TOMORROW,

1:05:25.356 --> 1:05:26.487
UNFORTUNATELY.

1:05:26.531 --> 1:05:27.967
-OH.
-PETER CALLED,

1:05:28.011 --> 1:05:28.968
AND THE STUDIO
NEEDS US THERE

1:05:29.012 --> 1:05:30.535
FOR A PRESS EVENT
TOMORROW NIGHT.

1:05:32.711 --> 1:05:33.799
GRAHAM'S NOT GOING, RIGHT?

1:05:33.842 --> 1:05:35.105
HE IS.

1:05:35.148 --> 1:05:36.454
WHEN THE STUDIO HEAD
SAYS JUMP,

1:05:36.497 --> 1:05:38.369
THE RIGHT RESPONSE
IS, "HOW HIGH?"

1:05:40.110 --> 1:05:41.198
HE JUST...

1:05:41.241 --> 1:05:43.287
HE HADN'T SAID ANYTHING.

1:05:43.330 --> 1:05:44.897
OH...

1:05:44.941 --> 1:05:46.290
WELL, I'M SURE
HE'S GOING TO TELL YOU.

1:05:47.813 --> 1:05:49.162
YEAH.

1:05:49.206 --> 1:05:51.425
GOOD NIGHT.

1:05:51.469 --> 1:05:53.036
BYE.

1:06:05.048 --> 1:06:07.702
UNCLE ROY.

1:06:07.746 --> 1:06:09.574
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UP HERE?

1:06:09.617 --> 1:06:12.098
OH, JUST OUT
FOR MY EVENING STRETCH.

1:06:12.142 --> 1:06:13.839
YOU?

1:06:13.882 --> 1:06:15.623
I...

1:06:17.669 --> 1:06:19.758
WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
HOW FOOLISH I'VE BEEN.

1:06:21.978 --> 1:06:24.458
GRAHAM'S LEAVING.
HE'S GOING BACK TO L.A.

1:06:24.502 --> 1:06:25.546
WELL...

1:06:25.590 --> 1:06:28.593
I WOULDN'T JUDGE HIM
TOO HARSHLY.

1:06:28.636 --> 1:06:29.855
HE SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HEART.

1:06:32.727 --> 1:06:34.120
I WISH I COULD BE
AS FORGIVING AS YOU.

1:06:34.164 --> 1:06:35.426
WELL...

1:06:35.469 --> 1:06:37.732
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
A QUESTION OF FORGIVENESS.

1:06:37.776 --> 1:06:40.997
IT'S JUST ACCEPTING FOLKS
FOR WHO THEY ARE.

1:06:43.129 --> 1:06:44.870
I KNOW.

1:06:44.913 --> 1:06:47.873
IT'S MY MISTAKE
MORE THAN HIS.

1:06:47.916 --> 1:06:50.571
IT WAS TOO SOON FOR ME

1:06:50.615 --> 1:06:51.529
TO START SOMETHING
WITH SOMEONE NEW.

1:06:56.099 --> 1:06:59.232
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT FOAL
THAT YOUR AUNT RAISED?

1:06:59.276 --> 1:07:00.973
IT WAS BORN
THREE WEEKS TOO EARLY.

1:07:01.017 --> 1:07:02.627
IT COULD BARELY STAND.

1:07:02.670 --> 1:07:04.411
YEAH.

1:07:04.455 --> 1:07:06.805
THE VET SAID, "DON'T
GET TOO ATTACHED..."

1:07:06.848 --> 1:07:10.591
BUT BETH SPENT
EVERY WAKING MINUTE

1:07:10.635 --> 1:07:11.810
WITH THAT ANIMAL...

1:07:11.853 --> 1:07:16.336
MADE SURE THAT IT WAS
WELL-FED AND WARM.

1:07:17.990 --> 1:07:18.991
I THINK SHE STAYED
IN THAT BARN

1:07:19.035 --> 1:07:20.036
FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS!

1:07:22.777 --> 1:07:27.521
NOW, THAT LITTLE FOAL
IS A VERY BIG, HEALTHY HORSE,

1:07:27.565 --> 1:07:29.045
AND YOUR AUNT'S
THE ONE WHO'S GONE.

1:07:31.786 --> 1:07:32.657
YOU'VE GOT
TO ACCEPT, HONEY,

1:07:32.700 --> 1:07:34.746
THAT...

1:07:34.789 --> 1:07:36.226
THINGS COME AND GO.

1:07:36.269 --> 1:07:40.230
BEST WE CAN DO IS JUST
ENJOY THEM WHILE THEY'RE HERE.

1:07:44.234 --> 1:07:46.323
IT'S JUST SO HARD
TO MAKE SENSE OF IT SOMETIMES.

1:07:46.366 --> 1:07:48.542
IT IS...

1:07:48.586 --> 1:07:50.718
BUT I PROMISE YOU THIS...

1:07:50.762 --> 1:07:52.938
TOMORROW IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE
JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER

1:07:52.981 --> 1:07:53.895
THAN TODAY.

1:07:56.855 --> 1:07:58.248
WELL, HOPEFULLY,
OUR CHRISTMAS PARADE

1:07:58.291 --> 1:08:00.163
WILL PUT SOME SMILES
ON PEOPLE'S FACES.

1:08:00.206 --> 1:08:02.295
I THINK IT ALREADY HAS.

1:08:05.255 --> 1:08:06.995
SORRY.

1:08:07.039 --> 1:08:08.606
IT'S PROBABLY MY BOSS.
HE DOESN'T SLEEP.

1:08:10.260 --> 1:08:11.217
GOOD NIGHT, UNCLE ROY.

1:08:11.261 --> 1:08:13.306
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.

1:08:13.350 --> 1:08:15.830
MR. JACOBS?

1:08:15.874 --> 1:08:17.876
MERRY CHRISTMAS
TO YOU, SIR.

1:08:29.105 --> 1:08:30.106
NICE WORK.

1:08:30.149 --> 1:08:31.672
HA!

1:08:31.716 --> 1:08:32.673
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE REALLY CAUGHT
THE CHRISTMAS BUG, HUH?

1:08:32.717 --> 1:08:34.675
I THINK SO.

1:08:34.719 --> 1:08:36.329
VOILA.

1:08:36.373 --> 1:08:37.983
MAYBE YOU CAN SHOW ME HOW TO DO
THAT WHEN WE'RE ON LOCATION.

1:08:38.026 --> 1:08:39.376
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT I CAN.

1:08:39.419 --> 1:08:41.073
I'LL BE AN EXPERT BY THE TIME
WE START SHOOTING.

1:08:43.858 --> 1:08:45.295
GRAHAM...

1:08:45.338 --> 1:08:46.252
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

1:08:46.296 --> 1:08:47.471
FOR WHAT?

1:08:52.998 --> 1:08:54.565
FOR NOT SEEING THINGS
MORE CLEARLY BEFORE.

1:08:55.870 --> 1:08:56.784
LOOK, I GET IT.

1:08:58.743 --> 1:09:00.136
DESPITE OUR HEADLINES,
YOU AND I...

1:09:01.224 --> 1:09:02.268
WE WEREN'T MEANT TO BE...

1:09:04.401 --> 1:09:05.402
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT,

1:09:05.445 --> 1:09:07.317
SARAH'S PRETTY GREAT.

1:09:09.188 --> 1:09:10.320
I CAN SEE
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER.

1:09:13.105 --> 1:09:14.280
IT'S THAT OBVIOUS, HUH?

1:09:14.324 --> 1:09:15.934
WELL, YOU'RE NOT THAT GREAT
OF AN ACTOR.

1:09:15.977 --> 1:09:17.631
OH, OUCH.

1:09:19.329 --> 1:09:21.853
HEY...

1:09:21.896 --> 1:09:22.767
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS?

1:09:22.810 --> 1:09:24.986
WE BETTER BE.

1:09:25.030 --> 1:09:26.205
WE HAVE TO SPEND THREE MONTHS
ON LOCATION TOGETHER.

1:09:26.249 --> 1:09:28.425
HEY, YEAH,
WE DO.

1:09:29.382 --> 1:09:31.036
HEY?

1:09:32.603 --> 1:09:33.691
THANK YOU.

1:09:44.789 --> 1:09:46.225
HEY, SARAH...

1:09:46.269 --> 1:09:47.661
I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

1:09:50.142 --> 1:09:51.274
WERE YOU GOING TO LET ME KNOW
YOU WERE LEAVING?

1:09:52.753 --> 1:09:54.102
NICOLE TOLD ME.

1:09:54.146 --> 1:09:55.800
HOLD ON...
HOLD ON, SARAH.

1:09:55.843 --> 1:09:58.106
IT'S FINE.

1:09:58.150 --> 1:09:59.543
I KNOW YOU HAVE
RESPONSIBILITIES

1:09:59.586 --> 1:10:00.457
BACK IN L.A.

1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:02.241
SARAH...

1:10:02.285 --> 1:10:03.938
I KNEW WE'D HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE
SOONER OR LATER.

1:10:03.982 --> 1:10:05.201
IT MIGHT AS WELL BE SOONER,
RIGHT?

1:10:07.725 --> 1:10:09.335
IT WOULD NEVER WORK OUT
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.

1:10:09.379 --> 1:10:11.990
YOUR... LIFE
IS IN LOS ANGELES,

1:10:12.033 --> 1:10:14.906
AND...
I HAVE TO HEAD BACK EAST.

1:10:16.647 --> 1:10:17.648
LOOK, I TRAINED YOU

1:10:17.691 --> 1:10:19.345
HOW TO BE
A RANCH HAND, RIGHT?

1:10:19.389 --> 1:10:21.869
SO YOU'RE READY
FOR YOUR MOVIE, AND...

1:10:21.913 --> 1:10:23.175
YOU HELPED ME OUT
WITH THE PARADE,

1:10:23.219 --> 1:10:25.221
SO... YOU HELD UP
YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN.

1:10:26.918 --> 1:10:27.919
IT'S DONE.

1:10:29.529 --> 1:10:30.661
WHAT'S DONE?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1:10:30.704 --> 1:10:32.228
THE DEAL'S DONE.

1:10:34.317 --> 1:10:35.231
GOOD LUCK IN L.A.

1:10:57.340 --> 1:10:58.863
UNCLE ROY?

1:10:58.906 --> 1:10:59.907
IT'S SO EARLY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

1:10:59.951 --> 1:11:01.648
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

1:11:01.692 --> 1:11:03.171
ME NEITHER.

1:11:03.215 --> 1:11:05.130
SO I CAME DOWN,
AND I STARTED LOOKING AT THESE.

1:11:09.569 --> 1:11:11.441
OH... ALL OUR OLD
CHRISTMASES HERE?

1:11:11.484 --> 1:11:13.617
: MM-HMM.

1:11:13.660 --> 1:11:14.792
REMEMBER THAT ONE?

1:11:14.835 --> 1:11:16.272
YES, I DO.

1:11:20.928 --> 1:11:23.627
I'M GOING TO MISS
THIS PLACE SO MUCH.

1:11:23.670 --> 1:11:25.672
YEP.

1:11:25.716 --> 1:11:27.631
A LOT OF WONDERFUL
MEMORIES.

1:11:31.374 --> 1:11:33.463
: I KNOW,
NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANT TO,

1:11:33.506 --> 1:11:37.597
IT'S NOT FAIR FOR ME TO ASK YOU
TO HOLD ON TO THE RANCH,

1:11:37.641 --> 1:11:38.685
IF I'M GOING BACK
TO NEW YORK,

1:11:38.729 --> 1:11:40.426
AND CODY'S MOVING TO L.A...

1:11:42.863 --> 1:11:45.039
BUT TONIGHT'S
CHRISTMAS EVE.

1:11:45.083 --> 1:11:46.258
IT'S PROBABLY
OUR LAST ONE HERE,

1:11:46.302 --> 1:11:47.172
SO...

1:11:49.043 --> 1:11:50.001
AND?

1:11:52.743 --> 1:11:53.918
AND I THINK
WE SHOULD LIGHT THIS PLACE UP

1:11:53.961 --> 1:11:55.180
AS MUCH AS AUNT BETH EVER DID.

1:11:56.834 --> 1:11:58.662
I MEAN, SHE WAS SO PROUD
OF THIS PLACE.

1:11:58.705 --> 1:12:00.794
WOULDN'T SHE WANT US
TO SHOW IT OFF

1:12:00.838 --> 1:12:02.274
AND DECORATE THAT TREE
ONE LAST TIME?

1:12:02.318 --> 1:12:03.754
AW, HONEY,
THERE'S SO LITTLE TIME.

1:12:03.797 --> 1:12:05.277
I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE CAN EVER DO THAT.

1:12:07.061 --> 1:12:07.932
WELL, WE COULD TRY.

1:12:12.458 --> 1:12:13.720
WELL...

1:12:13.764 --> 1:12:16.462
IN THAT CASE...

1:12:16.506 --> 1:12:18.421
WE'D BETTER WAKE UP CODY
AND SEE WHAT DELILAH'S UP TO.

1:12:22.381 --> 1:12:24.252
I LOVE YOU,
UNCLE ROY.

1:12:24.296 --> 1:12:26.472
I LOVE YOU BACK.

1:12:37.178 --> 1:12:38.049
HEADING OUT
TO THE AIRPORT, HUH?

1:12:38.092 --> 1:12:39.137
YEAH.

1:12:39.180 --> 1:12:41.357
JUST WAITING FOR THE CAB
TO SHOW UP.

1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:42.575
UH-HUH.

1:12:42.619 --> 1:12:43.576
ANY CHANCE YOU
COULD STICK AROUND

1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:45.404
'TIL AFTER CHRISTMAS?

1:12:45.448 --> 1:12:47.319
UNFORTUNATELY,

1:12:47.363 --> 1:12:48.494
I'VE GOT TO BE BACK IN L.A.
TONIGHT.

1:12:52.585 --> 1:12:55.414
SARAH MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR
THAT SHE WANTS ME TO GO,

1:12:55.458 --> 1:12:56.676
SO...

1:12:58.112 --> 1:12:59.810
YOU KNOW...

1:13:01.464 --> 1:13:03.596
I WAS IN A SITUATION
NOT SO DIFFERENT THAN YOURS

1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:04.510
BACK WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

1:13:06.599 --> 1:13:07.731
I WAS AT
A TRAIN STATION,

1:13:07.774 --> 1:13:10.255
HEADING HOME FROM CHICAGO.

1:13:10.298 --> 1:13:12.823
SO I WENT
AND BOUGHT MY TICKET,

1:13:12.866 --> 1:13:14.694
SAT DOWN ON A BENCH
TO WAIT FOR THE TRAIN,

1:13:14.738 --> 1:13:17.393
AND, UH...

1:13:17.436 --> 1:13:19.438
THIS AMAZING GIRL SAT DOWN
NEXT TO ME.

1:13:21.005 --> 1:13:23.268
WELL, WE STRUCK UP
A CONVERSATION.

1:13:23.311 --> 1:13:25.444
IT TURNS OUT
WE HAD A WHOLE LOT IN COMMON.

1:13:25.488 --> 1:13:27.185
WE TALKED FOR HOURS.

1:13:28.491 --> 1:13:29.492
AND?

1:13:29.535 --> 1:13:30.449
AND...

1:13:30.493 --> 1:13:34.061
TURNS OUT,
I MISSED MY TRAIN.

1:13:36.890 --> 1:13:39.502
WASTED A TICKET, TOO...

1:13:39.545 --> 1:13:41.982
BUT WHAT I GOT BACK...

1:13:42.026 --> 1:13:42.896
WAS A WONDERFUL LIFE.

1:13:44.681 --> 1:13:45.986
MATTER OF FACT,
I STILL GOT THAT TICKET.

1:13:46.030 --> 1:13:49.990
KEPT IT ALL THESE YEARS.

1:13:50.034 --> 1:13:52.340
IT'S MY LITTLE REMINDER

1:13:52.384 --> 1:13:54.212
NOT TO LET LIFE
PASS ME BY.

1:13:54.255 --> 1:13:55.605
MAY I?

1:13:58.956 --> 1:14:00.218
I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE
PULLED THIS OUT

1:14:00.261 --> 1:14:01.306
A LOT SOONER,

1:14:01.349 --> 1:14:04.396
BUT, UH,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:05.571
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE...

1:14:07.225 --> 1:14:08.313
FOR ANY OF US.

1:14:11.447 --> 1:14:13.797
YOU HAVE
A GOOD FLIGHT.

1:14:20.325 --> 1:14:21.369
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

1:14:21.413 --> 1:14:22.632
WE MIGHT BE UP
AGAINST THE CLOCK,

1:14:22.675 --> 1:14:23.763
BUT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS

1:14:23.807 --> 1:14:24.895
THE BEST TREE-LIGHTING
CEREMONY EVER!

1:14:24.938 --> 1:14:26.636
CODY, THE DECORATIONS
AND THE LIGHTS

1:14:26.679 --> 1:14:27.767
ARE OUT IN THE BARN.

1:14:27.811 --> 1:14:29.203
I HATE TO BE THE
BEARER OF BAD NEWS,

1:14:29.247 --> 1:14:30.509
BUT IT USUALLY TAKES DAYS
TO GET THE TREE UP PROPERLY.

1:14:30.553 --> 1:14:31.554
HE'S RIGHT.

1:14:31.597 --> 1:14:33.556
WELL THEN, WE'D
BETTER GET GOING!

1:14:33.599 --> 1:14:34.774
THAT TREE AIN'T GOING
TO DECORATE ITSELF.

1:14:36.559 --> 1:14:37.734
DELILAH, CALL AS MANY PEOPLE
AS YOU CAN.

1:14:37.777 --> 1:14:39.300
WE'RE GOING TO NEED HELP.

1:14:39.344 --> 1:14:41.172
I'M GOING TO PUT A PHONE CALL IN
TO THE RADIO STATION, TOO.

1:14:41.215 --> 1:14:43.217
COME ON!
LET'S GO!

1:14:43.261 --> 1:14:44.654
DO YOU THINK
I COULD LEND A HAND?

1:14:48.005 --> 1:14:49.354
I THOUGHT YOU'D LEFT.

1:14:49.397 --> 1:14:50.486
NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO GET RID OF ME THAT EASY.

1:14:53.532 --> 1:14:54.533
BUT...

1:14:54.577 --> 1:14:55.578
I'M HERE.
I'M HERE FOR THE PARADE.

1:14:55.621 --> 1:14:56.796
I'M HERE FOR THE TREE-LIGHTING.

1:14:56.840 --> 1:14:57.754
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

1:15:00.539 --> 1:15:01.497
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

1:15:01.540 --> 1:15:03.673
BUT I DO.

1:15:05.413 --> 1:15:07.198
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU...

1:15:09.505 --> 1:15:10.767
AND BESIDES,

1:15:10.810 --> 1:15:12.464
A RANCH HAND DOESN'T LEAVE A JOB
HALF-FINISHED.

1:15:17.121 --> 1:15:18.383
WHAT ABOUT NICOLE?

1:15:18.426 --> 1:15:19.819
THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING
BETWEEN ME AND NICOLE.

1:15:19.863 --> 1:15:20.864
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO TRUST ME ON THAT.

1:15:22.648 --> 1:15:23.519
TRUST AN ACTOR?

1:15:26.173 --> 1:15:27.174
COME ON.

1:15:30.569 --> 1:15:31.614
EVERYONE,
MAKE SURE YOU KEEP LOOKING

1:15:31.657 --> 1:15:33.354
AT AUNT BETH'S OLD PHOTO ALBUMS.

1:15:33.398 --> 1:15:35.052
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET
AS MANY OF HER PERSONAL TOUCHES

1:15:35.095 --> 1:15:36.662
AS POSSIBLE.

1:15:36.706 --> 1:15:38.403
WHO KNEW A MOVIE STAR
COULD CLIMB LIKE THAT?

1:15:40.144 --> 1:15:41.667
HOW ARE WE DOING
FOR TIME?

1:15:41.711 --> 1:15:43.887
WELL, WE'RE CUTTING IT CLOSE,
BUT I THINK WE'LL MAKE IT.

1:15:43.930 --> 1:15:45.497
: WELL,
I CLOSED DOWN THE CAFE,

1:15:45.541 --> 1:15:46.803
AND MY STAFF SHOULD BE
HERE ANY MINUTE TO HELP.

1:15:46.846 --> 1:15:47.847
OH, HEY!

1:15:51.503 --> 1:15:52.548
SARAH, CAN I GET ONE MORE?

1:16:08.825 --> 1:16:10.522
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE
MY AUNT BETH PROUD.

1:16:10.566 --> 1:16:12.176
WELL, YOU DID.

1:16:12.219 --> 1:16:13.656
I THINK YOU DID.

1:16:21.359 --> 1:16:22.273
LOOKS AMAZING.

1:16:24.101 --> 1:16:25.102
THANK YOU.

1:16:29.410 --> 1:16:30.498
I'M SORRY.

1:16:30.542 --> 1:16:32.892
UM, THE PARADE
STARTS IN AN HOUR,

1:16:32.936 --> 1:16:33.763
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY--

1:16:33.806 --> 1:16:35.199
IT'S PETER.

1:16:35.242 --> 1:16:36.156
DO YOU NEED TO GET THAT?

1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:37.723
NO. NO.
I'LL CALL HIM BACK.

1:16:40.073 --> 1:16:41.205
WOW.

1:16:41.248 --> 1:16:43.424
I HOPE IT DOESN'T RAIN
ON THE PARADE.

1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:46.558
SEE WHAT I DID THERE?
COME ON.

1:16:50.997 --> 1:16:52.129
WHAT IS IT?

1:16:55.785 --> 1:16:57.308
IT'S JUST PERFECT.

1:16:59.832 --> 1:17:02.313
MY LAST CHRISTMAS EVE
AT THE RANCH.

1:17:05.316 --> 1:17:06.317
YOU OKAY?

1:17:08.362 --> 1:17:09.755
I'M FINE.

1:17:11.278 --> 1:17:12.497
LET'S GO MAKE THIS
A PARADE TO REMEMBER.

1:17:14.151 --> 1:17:15.065
COME ON.

1:17:24.857 --> 1:17:25.989
-: HEY!
-HI.

1:17:26.032 --> 1:17:26.990
YOU READY TO GO?

1:17:27.033 --> 1:17:27.947
HOW DO I LOOK?

1:17:27.991 --> 1:17:29.209
YOU LOOK

1:17:29.253 --> 1:17:30.080
LIKE YOU WERE BORN
TO BE IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

1:17:30.123 --> 1:17:30.994
WELL, I FIGURED
IT WAS TIME

1:17:31.037 --> 1:17:31.951
TO STOP HIDING OUT.

1:17:33.474 --> 1:17:34.824
IT'S TOO BAD
ABOUT ALL THIS RAIN.

1:17:34.867 --> 1:17:36.564
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

1:17:36.608 --> 1:17:37.609
WOULD YOU TAKE HIM
FOR A SEC?

1:17:37.653 --> 1:17:38.871
YEAH, OF COURSE.

1:17:38.915 --> 1:17:39.872
OKAY.

1:17:39.916 --> 1:17:41.091
C'MON, BUDDY.

1:17:43.746 --> 1:17:45.443
HAS ANYONE SEEN GRAHAM?

1:17:45.486 --> 1:17:46.705
HE SAID
HE'D BE RIGHT BACK...

1:17:46.749 --> 1:17:48.359
SOMETHING ABOUT A LITTLE
CHRISTMAS SURPRISE?

1:17:48.402 --> 1:17:50.274
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO START WITHOUT HIM.

1:17:50.317 --> 1:17:51.797
DON'T WORRY,
HE'LL BE HERE.

1:17:51.841 --> 1:17:54.147
OH, AND SARAH?

1:17:54.191 --> 1:17:55.148
THANK YOU.

1:17:59.892 --> 1:18:00.719
SEE YOU UP THERE.

1:18:00.763 --> 1:18:02.373
COME ON, BOY.

1:18:03.548 --> 1:18:05.942
THAT'S THE SIGNAL
TO START THE PARADE.

1:18:05.985 --> 1:18:07.334
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
WE'D BETTER GET STARTED,

1:18:07.378 --> 1:18:08.727
GRAHAM OR NO GRAHAM.

1:18:08.771 --> 1:18:10.468
HEY, NOT SO FAST,

1:18:10.511 --> 1:18:11.687
NOT SO FAST.

1:18:13.166 --> 1:18:14.211
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1:18:14.254 --> 1:18:15.429
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1:18:15.473 --> 1:18:16.692
SEE, I TOLD YOU

1:18:16.735 --> 1:18:18.389
THESE $800 BOOTS
WERE GOING TO COME IN HANDY.

1:18:20.130 --> 1:18:21.609
WELL, LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE FINALLY
FOUND

1:18:21.653 --> 1:18:23.046
A LITTLE BIT
OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

1:18:23.089 --> 1:18:25.178
THANKS TO YOU, SARAH MCKINNEY.
