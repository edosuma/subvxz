00:10.280 --> 00:11.475
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:11.640 --> 00:12.630
Dex.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.110
Shoot him.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.516
Do what you gotta do.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.440
Oh, my God!

00:19.600 --> 00:22.593
Whoever Deb was before
killing LaGuerta, that person is dead.

00:22.760 --> 00:23.750
Oh, my God!

00:23.960 --> 00:26.998
What we think is the shooter
approached the vehicle from behind.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.873
El Sapo drew his gun.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.153
I know you killed El Sapo.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.392
What if I weren't here
to cover your ass?

00:35.560 --> 00:37.040
You really wanna play
that game?

00:37.480 --> 00:38.914
What's going on with Debra?

00:39.200 --> 00:41.590
- It's between me and her.
- It's affecting you.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.911
We're not going to talk about Deb.

00:44.280 --> 00:48.035
I thought we'd make it to one minute
before you mentioned your fiancÃ©e.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.557
I got your brother on my ass
about taking the sergeant's test.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.439
You're on my ass about Deb.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.832
Interior insular cortex is missing,
just like the last one.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.310
So we have a serial.

01:00.480 --> 01:01.630
Vogel was right.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.515
"Lyle Sussman."

01:03.680 --> 01:07.310
- I don't know anybody by that name.
- It doesn't mean he doesn't know you.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.920
He was coerced.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.999
Sussman was never a real killer.
He's just another victim.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.120
You were wrong about me.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.832
I destroyed Deb.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.156
I'm a mistake.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.070
You're exactly what you need to be.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.349
Daddy?

03:27.280 --> 03:28.350
Harrison?

03:31.680 --> 03:33.034
Daddy?

03:34.680 --> 03:36.478
Harrison?

03:45.960 --> 03:47.155
Daddy?

03:47.320 --> 03:48.470
Harrison?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.756
My tummy hurts.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.271
Harrison, did you eat
a whole box of popsicles?

04:10.120 --> 04:11.759
Harrison.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.072
- Why?
- Because I love them.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.999
All right. Come on.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.438
Drink this. It'll make you feel better.
I promise.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.640
Good boy.

04:58.760 --> 05:02.674
<i>A tiny shot of pink
is all it takes to fix my son's pain.</i>

05:03.360 --> 05:06.239
<i>I just wish it were that easy
to help Deb.</i>

05:33.040 --> 05:35.271
- What?
- Lieutenant Morgan?

05:35.480 --> 05:37.073
Formerly known as.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.273
Have you been drinking?

05:40.760 --> 05:42.399
There a problem, officer?

05:42.560 --> 05:45.234
Well, yes. You're in a car,
drunk, with an open container.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.278
Several, actually.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.833
Well, at least I pulled over.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.911
I've had a really bad couple of days.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.112
Maybe you could just
cut me some slack?

05:57.880 --> 06:00.076
- I wish I could, but--
- But what?

06:00.240 --> 06:01.993
There's been damage to city property.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.550
Property damage?
Are you fucking kidding me?

06:04.760 --> 06:06.991
I'm gonna need you
to get out of the car, please.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.680
Oh, mother shit.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.632
Is there someone I can call?
Your brother?

06:30.800 --> 06:33.110
No, fucking don't call Dexter.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.559
Quinn.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.035
Yeah. I'll be right there.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.395
Is everything okay?

06:52.960 --> 06:54.474
Yeah. Just cop stuff.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.520
- Okay.
- I'll call you later.

06:56.680 --> 06:57.670
Okay.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.520
- Deb.
- I'm up.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.196
You okay?

07:23.920 --> 07:25.559
I feel like I got hit by a truck.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.670
Jesus, Deb.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.156
Oh, God, please,
just save me the lecture, okay?

07:32.600 --> 07:34.637
My head hurts like a motherfucker.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.800
I'm not gonna lecture you.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.750
They book you yet?

07:39.920 --> 07:41.400
No, not yet.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.276
They kept me out
of the drunk tank, though.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.917
Thank God for professional courtesy.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.749
All right.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.480
Let me see if I can get you out of this.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.352
Hey. How you doing?

08:00.240 --> 08:01.560
Can I get a little help?

08:01.720 --> 08:02.995
What can I do for you?

08:18.560 --> 08:20.995
<i>Deb's had me
on such a roller coaster...</i>

08:21.160 --> 08:24.710
<i>...I actually appreciate
walking into familiar territory.</i>

08:25.400 --> 08:26.914
<i>Lyle Sussman's cabin.</i>

08:30.560 --> 08:32.232
<i>But where's the body?</i>

08:39.400 --> 08:42.039
Dex? This is our guy, Sussman.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.714
The Brain Surgeon.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.354
<i>Not exactly.</i>

08:52.920 --> 08:55.515
<i>Did the real Brain Surgeon
restage the crime scene...</i>

08:55.920 --> 08:58.071
<i>...obscuring any evidence
that Sussman's body...</i>

08:58.240 --> 09:00.880
<i>...was ever hanging
from a hook in the back of his skull?</i>

09:01.040 --> 09:02.633
Give me a hand?

09:13.080 --> 09:15.515
His front teeth are broken.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.677
Looks like Sussman put this shotgun
in his mouth, and blam...

09:21.760 --> 09:23.240
...blew his head off.

09:23.840 --> 09:28.039
<i>Or someone put the gun in his mouth
and pulled the trigger post-mortem.</i>

09:36.280 --> 09:38.272
GSR on Sussman's hands.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.840
Maybe he finally found his conscience,
couldn't live with what he did.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.400
No note, though.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.354
Ah, suicide.

09:47.560 --> 09:50.712
- Makes our lives so much easier.
- You should put that on a T-shirt.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.238
<i>Whoever's after Vogel
wants the cops off the case.</i>

09:57.800 --> 10:00.315
- Is Vogel here yet?
- I just called her.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.393
Where the fuck is Quinn?

10:07.520 --> 10:09.432
You can thank me later.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.950
You still keep a stash of gum in here?

10:14.200 --> 10:15.793
I can smell my own breath.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.913
You sure you want to go to work...

10:18.080 --> 10:20.072
...after spending the night
in the station?

10:20.240 --> 10:22.800
I mean, I could take you home.
You could shower.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.318
I keep deodorant in my desk.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.679
Thanks for the ride.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.633
Deb, wait.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.560
What?

10:44.240 --> 10:47.392
- Should I be worried?
- About what?

10:48.720 --> 10:50.154
About you.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.557
Think you might have a problem?

10:55.880 --> 10:57.917
You mean like a drinking problem?

10:58.960 --> 11:00.679
I'm just saying.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.118
Are you serious? You, of all people...

11:03.280 --> 11:06.432
- ...accusing me of a drinking problem?
- Not accusing you of anything.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.838
How many times have you shown up
at a crime scene smelling like booze?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.070
A lot, okay?

11:11.240 --> 11:13.550
Which means I've been down this road,
so I get it.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.712
I'm not down any fucking road.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.555
But at least when I was spinning out,
I had a reason.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.832
- What do you mean, you had a reason?
- You, dumb-ass.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.076
You turned down my proposal.
That was my reason.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.959
So, what's yours?

11:35.200 --> 11:38.193
Maybe I just don't know my own limits,
or something.

11:43.880 --> 11:47.032
- I didn't--
- That's my boss. I gotta go.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.714
Deb--

11:57.440 --> 11:58.920
You might want to straighten up.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.640
We have a new client coming in at 9.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.152
I'm frightened. He's escalating,
and we're left to play catch-up.

13:19.360 --> 13:22.956
I'll run tests at the lab, but I'm guessing
this tissue belongs to Sussman.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.192
Explains why the killer
blew his head off with a shotgun...

13:26.800 --> 13:30.316
...so nobody'd notice the pieces were
missing. What part of the brain is it?

13:30.480 --> 13:32.392
It's the occipital lobe.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.279
It's responsible for vision.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.232
He's sending us a message.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.920
He's watching us.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.998
That, and the "His" and "Hers" boxes?

13:41.160 --> 13:43.117
He's aware of me now, not just you.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.950
I'm sorry, Dexter,
to have dragged you into this.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.392
He sent both packages to you.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.672
Maybe doesn't know how to find me.
Probably doesn't even know my name.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.600
- Yet.
- Yeah, I know.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.150
I need to get to him
before he gets to me.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.993
I've been going through your book...

14:00.160 --> 14:04.393
...and cross-referencing it with the
source files and list of suspects.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.110
Any progress?

14:06.320 --> 14:08.073
I managed to clear
the first two names.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.509
So who's next?

14:09.680 --> 14:11.558
Ron Galuzzo.

14:11.720 --> 14:15.600
According to your files, he strangled
his best friend in high school...

14:15.760 --> 14:17.717
...but convinced you
that it was a bully?

14:17.880 --> 14:19.394
Yeah.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.632
It's rare
that someone can fool me like that.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.832
At his hearing,
I argued for leniency...

14:25.400 --> 14:28.154
...but when I eventually got him
to admit he'd been lying...

14:28.320 --> 14:30.118
...I reversed my recommendation.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.954
So if Galuzzo read your book
and recognised his story--

14:33.120 --> 14:35.715
He would've realised
that he'd been institutionalised...

14:35.880 --> 14:37.837
...until he was 21 because of me.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.750
That's a pretty good reason
to hold a grudge.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.989
Dex.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.150
Excuse me.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.200
It's about your sister.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.710
What about her?

14:52.880 --> 14:55.111
She got brought in
for a DUI last night.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.156
Shit.

14:58.320 --> 15:02.030
I managed to get her out of it,
but still, it was pretty bad.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.796
She asked me not to say anything
so I feel like a shit friend for telling...

15:05.960 --> 15:07.474
...but I'm worried about her.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.599
What the fuck's going on?

15:10.040 --> 15:12.475
- She's been having a hard time.
- Yeah, I know.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.718
But, man, this is, like,
a whole new level.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.275
What are we gonna do?

15:18.280 --> 15:21.193
I'll figure something out.
Thanks for the heads-up.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.839
I'm putting you up for sergeant,
and you show up late?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.469
Are you trying
to make me look like an asshole?

15:27.640 --> 15:29.791
Sorry. I had a situation.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.475
You want a situation?
Come to the cabin.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.639
What is it?

15:42.320 --> 15:46.155
It's Deb. She was brought in
for a DUI I need to check on her.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.113
Is alcohol an issue for her?

15:49.160 --> 15:52.232
I'm an issue for her.
She's acting this way because of me.

15:52.440 --> 15:56.116
But you can't keep taking on your
sister's problems, especially right now.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.590
It's my fault, okay?

15:59.920 --> 16:02.435
Deb found out what I am.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.080
She knows everything.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.559
Everything?

16:06.960 --> 16:08.076
How?

16:08.320 --> 16:12.439
It's a long story. Just suffice to say,
she's not handling it well.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.720
You do really feel badly, don't you?

16:17.680 --> 16:19.273
Are you analysing me now?

16:19.440 --> 16:21.875
- It's just so unusual.
- It's really not a good time.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.197
Most of the time, when people think
their partner's having an affair...

16:36.360 --> 16:38.113
...their partner's having an affair.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.869
- But not always, right?
- No, certainly not always.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.234
This is for you.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.750
My assistant will explain
the retainer and payment schedule...

16:49.920 --> 16:52.560
...and we'll get back to you
when we've found something.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.077
So nervous.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.869
Is that normal, to be nervous?

17:05.079 --> 17:07.515
Well, people go through
a wide range of emotions.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.638
I think the important thing
is finding out the truth.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.359
Don't look at me.
I think the truth is overrated.

17:19.079 --> 17:22.117
Call us if you have any questions,
and we'll be in touch.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.396
Yeah.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.034
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.600
Well, it looks like we have to work on
our client-relation skills.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.439
Are we done? I need a fucking nap.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.718
No, we're not done.
I've got something for you.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.193
What is that? A fucking shit shake?

17:49.640 --> 17:51.597
Special custom-made
supplement formula.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.992
It's got vitamins, some electrolytes,
a couple Chinese herbs.

17:55.160 --> 17:58.597
- It'll knock the hangover right out.
- How do you know I'm hung over?

18:02.440 --> 18:04.352
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.193
It's your brother.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.639
Awesome. Fucking awesome.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.913
What do you want?

18:30.080 --> 18:32.470
I heard about
what happened last night.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.119
Fucking Quinn.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.954
He's worried about you.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.634
We both are.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.434
You almost got a DUI?

18:41.640 --> 18:43.791
I think the operative word
is "almost."

18:44.880 --> 18:45.996
It's not a big deal.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.560
It's a very big deal.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.916
This is why I didn't tell you.
Knew you'd freak out.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.549
I'm not freaking out.
I'm just trying to help.

18:52.760 --> 18:56.310
Fuck, Dexter.
I don't have time for this, you know?

18:56.840 --> 18:59.560
I have to find out if some asshole
is banging some chick...

18:59.720 --> 19:01.757
...which he probably is,
so I can tell her...

19:01.920 --> 19:04.276
...and she can get
a killer divorce settlement...

19:04.440 --> 19:07.478
...and they can move on with
their stupid, fucking boring lives...

19:07.640 --> 19:09.836
...and I can move on with mine.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.478
- Because this is my life now.
- Well, it wasn't always.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.355
How about dinner tonight?

19:18.800 --> 19:21.190
- We can talk.
- I don't want to talk to you.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.670
Well, I'm gonna keep showing up here
until you do.

19:25.320 --> 19:27.277
If I agree to dinner, will you leave?

19:27.520 --> 19:28.920
Yes.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.030
Fine.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.355
Great. I'll pick you up at 8.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.350
ME's report is back from the cabin.

19:50.520 --> 19:54.514
They've officially ruled
Lyle Sussman's death as a suicide.

19:55.080 --> 19:59.518
So with that, the Brain Surgeon case
is officially closed.

19:59.920 --> 20:03.357
Okay. I'll call Evelyn,
thank her for her help.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.713
Evelyn? Someone's got
a high hard one for the good doctor.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.758
What did I say
about standing so close?

20:08.920 --> 20:10.912
Any progress
on that El Sapo shooting?

20:11.280 --> 20:14.671
Still no leads. I've been going back
and forth with Fort Lauderdale P.D.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.719
Apparently, El Sapo was a suspect
in the stabbing...

20:17.880 --> 20:21.237
...of a smash-and-grab lowlife
by the name of Andrew Briggs.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.831
<i>The cops will never find out
that Deb killed El Sapo.</i>

20:25.280 --> 20:28.398
<i>So right now,
I can focus on protecting Vogel...</i>

20:28.560 --> 20:29.710
<i>...and myself.</i>

20:39.040 --> 20:40.235
<i>Ron Galuzzo.</i>

20:40.600 --> 20:42.592
<i>He could be hunting me right now.</i>

20:47.280 --> 20:50.671
<i>Or he could be selling
fitness equipment at the mall.</i>

20:50.840 --> 20:52.194
Good work today, everyone.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.230
Deputy chief, got a sec?

21:09.280 --> 21:10.430
Wanted to let you know...

21:10.600 --> 21:13.638
...I've been thinking about
what you said, finding a new sergeant.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.553
And I've got my eye on Joey Quinn.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.513
Quinn? No way.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.876
- He's not sergeant material.
- He's a good cop.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.475
He's irresponsible, unpredictable...

21:22.960 --> 21:25.475
...not to mention unintelligible.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.513
No way he can pass
that sergeant exam.

21:27.880 --> 21:28.870
He'll pass.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.476
If you say so.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.477
- Are you getting all this?
- Yeah.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.674
This guy's making this
way too easy for us.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.036
Yeah, it's really fucking classy.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.560
So tell me, who's the guy
that dropped you off this morning?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.356
Who? Quinn?

22:06.760 --> 22:07.830
He's a friend.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.674
Kind of friend that drops you off
in last night's clothes?

22:10.840 --> 22:13.878
God, we're not sleeping together,
if that's what you're implying.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.878
Not that it's any of your business.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.713
No judgement, no judgement.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.918
You are certainly allowed
to be a player...

22:21.080 --> 22:24.790
- ...if you so choose.
- What makes you think I'm a player?

22:25.600 --> 22:29.480
First there's Briggs,
then there's your new friend.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.598
Well, he's not a new friend.

22:31.880 --> 22:34.395
We used to date, just not anymore.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.360
Really?

22:37.560 --> 22:38.994
So what happened?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.713
He proposed. I said no.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.239
Jesus Christ.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.069
He's certainly a better man than I am.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.675
Woman turns down my proposal,
I'm not gonna stay friends with her.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.753
Yeah, but that's just because
you're a giant pussy.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.798
Yes. Could be.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.470
<i>Ron Galuzzo.</i>

23:15.640 --> 23:18.633
<i>If he is a killer, then a mall
is the perfect watering hole...</i>

23:18.800 --> 23:20.598
<i>...for him to choose his prey.</i>

23:20.800 --> 23:25.079
So any of our products is gonna make
you stay in the shape that you are.

23:26.080 --> 23:31.838
And I need to do some more work,
so I'll see you a little bit later, okay?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.753
<i>It was dark at Sussman's cabin.</i>

23:33.920 --> 23:35.593
<i>Does he recognise me?</i>

23:36.320 --> 23:38.630
You've got a keen eye, my friend.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.677
The Chiseller 300.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.120
- Top of the line.
<i>- Or is he just trying to make a sale?</i>

23:45.280 --> 23:48.512
Just looking for an all-over workout,
maximise my time.

23:48.680 --> 23:51.479
- Mind if I take a body measurement?
- Sure.

23:56.840 --> 23:59.036
Looks like
you're already in pretty good shape.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.833
Oh, you have
a very low fat-to-muscle ratio.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.317
Well, thanks.
I do what I can, you know.

24:10.880 --> 24:14.669
Yeah, this equipment
is more for beginners...

24:14.840 --> 24:18.197
...people who don't already have
an established routine.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.829
<i>Does he know who I am?
Is he trying to get rid of me?</i>

24:21.000 --> 24:22.957
I'm just looking
to change up my workout.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.315
I'd love any suggestions.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.400
That baby...

24:30.560 --> 24:34.190
...cut you up faster
than a chef at Benihaha.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.397
- Come on, give it a try.
- Okay.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.951
<i>He doesn't seem to recognise me.</i>

24:41.160 --> 24:42.230
Careful.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.392
<i>Maybe a grudge against Vogel
will be harder to hide.</i>

24:46.280 --> 24:49.591
I like to read when I work out. Keeps
me from getting motion sickness.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.678
This one, I can't put down.
Heard of it?

24:51.880 --> 24:53.519
I'm not much of a reader.

24:53.720 --> 24:56.189
You probably heard of the author.
She's pretty famous.

24:56.800 --> 24:59.315
They call her
the Psychopath Whisperer.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.397
Dr. Evelyn Vogel?

25:02.600 --> 25:04.956
- Never heard of her.
<i>- Of course he's heard of Vogel.</i>

25:05.120 --> 25:06.918
<i>She treated him. He's lying.</i>

25:08.120 --> 25:09.600
You know, a fit guy like you...

25:09.760 --> 25:13.436
...you need to get up to at least
level five to feel the full effect.

25:13.960 --> 25:16.634
<i>But why lie,
unless he has something to hide?</i>

25:16.800 --> 25:18.200
Yeah, I feel it.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.272
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.872
Don't forget to breathe.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.877
You went to see Galuzzo?

25:29.720 --> 25:31.234
You could have exposed us both.

25:31.400 --> 25:34.518
It was worth the risk.
He's definitely hiding something.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.000
So now what?

25:37.560 --> 25:39.995
I break into his house tomorrow,
when he's at work...

25:40.160 --> 25:42.152
...try to find evidence
that he's our man.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.471
And in the meantime,
what if he comes for me?

25:44.640 --> 25:47.030
Do you have any way
to protect yourself?

25:47.440 --> 25:49.750
A gun. I haven't used it for years.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.874
Keep it loaded
and call me if you need me.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.520
I'm meeting Deb for dinner.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.239
- I'll check in with you later.
- Wait. Just--

25:58.600 --> 26:01.877
There's one thing I was wondering
about since we last spoke.

26:02.520 --> 26:03.590
Yes?

26:03.760 --> 26:06.480
When Harry and I
came up with the code...

26:06.640 --> 26:09.633
...he insisted
that you only kill bad people.

26:09.880 --> 26:13.715
And I insisted
that the first rule of the code be:

26:13.960 --> 26:15.110
"Don't get caught."

26:17.160 --> 26:18.992
Giving you a little wiggle room.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.116
Okay.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.037
So my question is this:

26:28.480 --> 26:33.236
When your sister found out about who
you were and what you were doing...

26:35.720 --> 26:38.474
- ...why didn't you kill her?
- What?

26:38.920 --> 26:40.798
Not that I'd advocate such a thing...

26:41.160 --> 26:45.234
...but since Debra knew the truth
about you, she's clearly a risk--

26:45.400 --> 26:47.312
I would never kill Debra.
She's my sister.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.039
I love her.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.356
What exactly do you love about her?

26:56.160 --> 26:57.514
What do you mean?

26:57.800 --> 27:00.076
When a psychopath
speaks about love...

27:01.000 --> 27:04.152
...it doesn't really mean the same thing
as for typical people.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.391
So what do you love about her?

27:10.040 --> 27:11.633
I don't know.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.512
I love having steaks
and beer with her...

27:19.400 --> 27:20.720
...and until recently...

27:20.880 --> 27:27.070
...the fact that she was always there
for me, the way she looked up to me.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.474
But none of that
is really about Debra.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.709
It's about what she does for you.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.474
So you're saying I'm selfish?

27:36.640 --> 27:38.199
I'm not criticising.

27:39.040 --> 27:42.192
Selfless love is hard enough
for typical people.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.591
And for psychopaths...

27:45.680 --> 27:46.716
...it's impossible.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.714
Why are you telling me this?
So I'll feel bad about myself?

27:49.920 --> 27:51.479
Quite the contrary.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.637
I want you to revel in what you are.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.792
I told you, you're perfect.

27:57.520 --> 28:00.115
How can you say that
when you know what I've done to Deb?

28:00.320 --> 28:01.754
That's my point.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.877
You're perfect as a psychopath.

28:04.080 --> 28:07.312
All this talk about helping Debra,
and loving her...

28:07.480 --> 28:11.633
...it's like you're Michelangelo
trying to play the banjo.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.600
I'm trying to be a good brother.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.229
Why don't you let me help Debra?

28:16.560 --> 28:18.916
Because she wouldn't even listen
to you.

28:19.360 --> 28:22.080
I'm the only one who understands her.

28:22.240 --> 28:26.598
Dexter, you admitted
to being the cause of her pain.

28:27.960 --> 28:30.316
How can you expect to be the solution?

28:31.480 --> 28:32.630
I can handle Deb.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.597
I've been doing it my entire life.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.750
All right, next question.

28:40.920 --> 28:44.709
Physically evasive movements to defeat
an officer's attempt to control is:

28:44.880 --> 28:49.193
A, active aggression,
B, physical resistance...

28:49.360 --> 28:53.434
...C, active resistance,
D, active evasion?

28:55.840 --> 28:57.559
B, active aggression.

28:57.760 --> 29:01.436
Okay, active aggression is actually A.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.355
And B, it's wrong.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.798
The answer is C, active resistance.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.069
Wait, I'm confused.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.469
Of course you are.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.831
Matthews was right.
You're a fucking lost cause.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.356
Jesus, Angel. Easy.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.552
Yeah, Angel. Easy.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.512
I stuck my neck out
on the line for you with Matthews.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.520
You better not fuck this up.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.679
Will you please cut him some slack?

29:24.840 --> 29:28.231
He's tired from being called out
in the middle of the night on that case.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.631
What case? There's no case.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.473
I'm...

29:40.880 --> 29:42.234
I'm gonna let you guys talk.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.157
So where did you really go at 4 a.m.?

29:56.600 --> 29:58.990
Deb was in trouble
and needed my help.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.551
She's been going through
kind of a hard time.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.275
And why did she call you?

30:04.960 --> 30:06.076
Why not her brother?

30:06.280 --> 30:10.115
I don't think they're getting along,
you know, and she's a friend.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.954
- I couldn't say no.
- She's more than a friend.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.839
I mean, you used to fuck her.

30:16.520 --> 30:19.354
And now she's calling you
for everything.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.032
What am I supposed to think?

30:22.680 --> 30:28.358
Jamie, I swear to you, there is nothing
going on between me and Deb.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.075
Then why lie about it?

30:30.280 --> 30:32.192
Because I didn't think
you'd understand.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.354
Well, you're right.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.676
I don't.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.072
Enjoy your dinner.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.637
The fuck are we doing
in this hellhole?

31:01.240 --> 31:04.358
Can I get you something to drink?
We have a wide array of cocktails.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.796
I'll take a bourbon, neat. Thank you.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.797
Two cokes, please.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.033
I knew this was a mistake.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.951
I wanted to show you something.

31:17.600 --> 31:21.674
You see that man over there?
The father?

31:23.400 --> 31:26.074
- Yeah.
- Does he look familiar?

31:30.760 --> 31:32.353
Fuck if I know.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.351
<i>Fuck. He's wearing Kevlar.</i>

31:49.560 --> 31:50.630
<i>Don't fucking move!</i>

31:50.840 --> 31:52.593
So what, Dex?
That was a long time ago.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.029
Yeah, but look.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.391
See this guy, the guy you saved?

32:01.200 --> 32:03.556
That's him. Right there.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.879
His little girl wouldn't have a father
if it weren't for you.

32:14.640 --> 32:17.439
That's why I brought you
to this hellhole, to show you that.

32:23.400 --> 32:27.280
I know you think you're a bad person
after all that happened, but you're not.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.518
You're a good person.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.518
You brought a lot of good to the world.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.031
I'm fucking starving.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.793
<i>Have a nice day at the mall.</i>

33:44.640 --> 33:47.280
I realise this is not the outcome
you were hoping for...

33:47.440 --> 33:50.911
...but it can help
with a favourable divorce settlement.

33:56.680 --> 33:59.639
If you want,
we can forward those to your attorney.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.150
I don't know.

34:07.520 --> 34:08.873
You don't have to decide now.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.438
I realise it's a lot to take in.

34:12.520 --> 34:15.353
I mean, I don't know if that's him.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.469
I'm sorry?

34:18.679 --> 34:23.471
This man in the pictures,
I'm not sure that's my husband.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.716
That's him, all right.
Look, you can see his face.

34:28.239 --> 34:29.799
Not clearly.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.754
The lighting isn't very good.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.918
Mrs. Gerard, I assure you,
we're always very careful--

34:35.080 --> 34:36.230
This was a mistake.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.995
- Mrs. Gerard--
- I'm sorry that I wasted your time.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.676
I'll leave a cheque at the front desk.

34:47.679 --> 34:50.434
Is she fucking kidding?
That's obviously her husband.

34:54.239 --> 34:56.038
She just didn't want to see it.

34:56.199 --> 34:58.669
People get used to living in denial.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.676
It's just easier, you know?

35:13.120 --> 35:15.999
<i>Galuzzo has to be the guy
we're looking for.</i>

35:30.360 --> 35:34.479
<i>Why would Galuzzo be such a slob
everywhere else but here?</i>

36:01.000 --> 36:03.879
<i>That's why the kitchen is so clean:
It's a kill room.</i>

36:04.040 --> 36:06.714
<i>Galuzzo wasn't checking my body fat
for my own fitness.</i>

36:06.880 --> 36:09.714
<i>He was checking to see
if I was fit to have as a main course.</i>

36:11.040 --> 36:14.238
<i>He's definitely a butcher. But does
that make him the Brain Surgeon?</i>

36:24.240 --> 36:25.674
<i>Our killer leaves bodies out...</i>

36:25.840 --> 36:28.719
<i>...but Galuzzo keeps his bodies
to season and savour.</i>

36:29.320 --> 36:30.879
<i>This brain is completely intact...</i>

36:31.080 --> 36:34.960
<i>...marinating in some sort of...
garlic sauce.</i>

36:36.000 --> 36:39.072
<i>Galuzzo wouldn't waste brains
by sending them to Vogel.</i>

36:39.240 --> 36:42.039
<i>They're a delicacy. He eats them.</i>

36:43.680 --> 36:46.878
<i>Which means whoever's after us
is still out there...</i>

36:47.040 --> 36:49.396
<i>...and he still has the upper hand.</i>

36:56.320 --> 36:58.232
<i>Fuck. He's wearing Kevlar.</i>

37:19.760 --> 37:21.797
<i>Fuck. He's wearing Kevlar.</i>

38:13.520 --> 38:15.830
Deb, what are you doing here?

38:19.320 --> 38:22.597
I want to make an official statement.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.113
How much have you had to drink?

38:26.600 --> 38:28.273
One or two.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.393
- Why don't we get some coffee?
- I don't want coffee.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.711
I want to confess.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.392
You want to confess to what?

38:39.520 --> 38:41.671
I killed LaGuerta.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.589
- You what?
- I killed LaGuer--

38:47.320 --> 38:49.596
Why don't we go someplace quiet
where we can talk?

38:49.800 --> 38:51.917
- Fuck!
- I got you.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.030
Take it easy.

38:55.000 --> 38:55.990
Calm down.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.080
What are you talking about?

39:15.320 --> 39:17.471
I told you. I killed LaGuerta.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.075
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It does.

39:23.880 --> 39:27.476
On New Year's Eve, I was at Papa's.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.799
I called dispatch to find out
where she was going.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.270
They said she was going
to the shipping yard...

39:35.440 --> 39:38.114
...where she met Estrada before.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.676
So you feel guilty
that you didn't back her up.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.794
I don't feel guilty.
I am guilty.

39:43.960 --> 39:46.953
No, you can't let yourself
think that way.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.520
You had no way of knowing...

39:48.680 --> 39:51.275
- ...what she was doing there.
- I did know.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.598
I killed her.

39:55.160 --> 39:59.393
Deb, Estrada killed LaGuerta.
We both know that.

40:01.520 --> 40:04.035
That's not what happened.
I'll tell you what happened.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.919
I know what happened.

40:06.120 --> 40:08.794
The bullet that killed LaGuerta
came from Estrada's gun.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.951
He shot first. It was a through and
through. Bullet was never recovered.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.998
She shot back. He went down.

40:15.160 --> 40:18.995
He got one more shot off, and that
bullet was traced to Estrada's gun.

40:20.840 --> 40:23.435
They both died at the same time.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.676
- That's not true.
- It is.

40:28.240 --> 40:30.277
Remember,
Dexter walked us through it.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.312
Dexter! Oh, fuck.

40:32.520 --> 40:33.636
Hey.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.995
Oh, God, Joey, you have to believe--

40:37.200 --> 40:38.634
Okay, okay. I believe you.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.718
I believe you. All right?

40:41.640 --> 40:43.074
Okay.

40:43.280 --> 40:48.071
Here, just write down everything you
remember from that night, all right?

40:48.240 --> 40:49.230
- Okay.
- All right.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.278
Good. Good.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.635
- Okay.
- I'll be right back with you.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.917
What about Arnold Gordon?
Trauma surgeon.

41:08.080 --> 41:09.878
He definitely has the right skill set.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.030
Motive?

41:11.200 --> 41:13.760
He always resented
that I called him a psychopath...

41:13.920 --> 41:17.391
...and he threatened to hurt me
if ever I told anyone that he was.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.109
- Morgan.
- You need to get down to the station.

41:25.760 --> 41:28.355
- I'm a little busy.
- Your sister just confessed...

41:28.520 --> 41:30.239
- ...to killing LaGuerta.
- What?

41:30.400 --> 41:33.120
<i>She's drunk, high, fucked up--
I put her in a room...</i>

41:33.280 --> 41:35.715
<i>- ...so nobody could see her.</i>
- Make sure she stays.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.519
- I'm on my way.
<i>- All right.</i>

41:40.080 --> 41:41.480
Is everything okay?

41:42.440 --> 41:43.920
It's Debra.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.995
I need you to come
to the station with me.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.636
- Has something happened?
- Yes.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.792
I can't believe she actually confessed.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.835
I thought I got her to see
that she's a good person.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.391
This could have been the only way
she could relieve herself of the guilt.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.479
Need you to help get her out of this.

42:05.640 --> 42:08.155
Give your expert opinion
that she's having a breakdown.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.789
Are you sure?

42:10.000 --> 42:11.753
This could be the best thing for her.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.111
Spending the rest of her life in prison?

42:14.280 --> 42:17.114
- That's the last thing Deb needs.
- Or the last thing you need.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.749
If Debra goes away,
odds are, you'll join her.

42:20.240 --> 42:23.756
Admit it, Dexter.
You're mostly worried about yourself.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.514
That's not true.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.073
I told you, I love her.

42:28.240 --> 42:29.720
Not the same way she loves you.

42:29.880 --> 42:33.430
When Debra killed LaGuerta,
it was real, selfless love.

42:33.720 --> 42:37.031
She sacrificed
everything she believed in for you.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.958
Can you see that?

42:41.240 --> 42:45.280
Your sister needs professional help.
There's nothing more you can do.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.997
Well, I can't just give up on her.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.313
I can't.

43:09.480 --> 43:11.631
Dex, hey. Dr. Vogel.

43:11.840 --> 43:15.038
She's an old friend of Deb's and Dad,
so I figured she could help.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.396
- Is she still in the interrogation room?
- Yeah.

43:17.560 --> 43:20.678
- Have you told anyone what she said?
- Course not. It's crazy, right?

43:20.840 --> 43:21.990
She's going through something.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.920
She's likely suffering
from posttraumatic stress disorder...

43:25.120 --> 43:27.794
- ...after Captain LaGuerta's death.
- She wasn't even there.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.674
One of the most common components
is survivor's guilt...

43:30.840 --> 43:34.356
...the belief that she could have
somehow prevented what happened.

43:34.520 --> 43:37.797
- That's what I was telling her.
- Not an uncommon response.

43:37.960 --> 43:40.236
We have to get her out of here.

43:42.760 --> 43:44.877
What the fuck are you doing here?

43:45.040 --> 43:46.360
Watch the hallway.

43:47.240 --> 43:49.596
Deb, this is Dr. Vogel.
She was a friend of Dad's.

43:49.760 --> 43:51.240
You can trust her. She can help.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.751
- Hello, Debra.
- I don't give a fuck who you are.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.149
Get the fuck out.

43:55.520 --> 43:57.876
Debra, I know how much pain
you must be feeling.

43:58.040 --> 44:02.034
But we need to talk about this before
you do something you might regret.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.356
Regret?

44:03.520 --> 44:06.160
The thing that I regret
happened six months ago.

44:06.320 --> 44:09.199
I'm confessing everything.
I'm telling the whole fucking truth!

44:09.360 --> 44:11.158
There's nothing you can do
to stop me!

44:11.320 --> 44:13.118
- Deb, please, let us--
- Quinn, let me--

44:15.040 --> 44:17.350
- That was interesting.
- Here. Hold this.

44:21.800 --> 44:22.995
She passed out.

44:24.720 --> 44:26.439
We must take her home to rest.

44:27.040 --> 44:28.235
Let's get her out of here.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.593
Is she gonna be okay?

44:35.800 --> 44:37.234
Absolutely.

44:37.520 --> 44:40.115
There may be some work to do,
but I promise...

44:40.320 --> 44:42.516
...Debra's gonna get through this.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.949
- Is there anything else you need?
- Not right now.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.720
Thanks for calling.
You did the right thing.

44:55.040 --> 44:56.394
What the fuck?

45:11.840 --> 45:15.151
Are you sure she'll be all right,
with everything she has in her system?

45:15.320 --> 45:18.154
Physically, she's fine.
It was a very low dose.

45:18.880 --> 45:20.553
But emotionally...

45:25.120 --> 45:26.554
This is all my fault.

45:27.360 --> 45:28.680
Go easy on yourself.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.951
I should have listened to you.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.999
I thought I could fix this,
but you're right. I can't.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.993
I don't want to just keep
making her worse.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.992
Do you really think you can help her?

45:52.800 --> 45:54.234
Yes.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.394
Okay.

46:04.480 --> 46:05.914
Go now.

46:06.880 --> 46:08.234
Let me do what I do.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.559
Wait.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.554
Dexter, what are you doing?

46:28.160 --> 46:30.720
She's gonna be pissed
when she wakes up...

46:32.320 --> 46:34.994
- ...maybe even violent.
- I can handle her.

46:36.400 --> 46:37.675
You don't know my sister.

46:43.440 --> 46:44.874
Thanks.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.560
<i>Vogel was right.</i>

46:52.520 --> 46:54.159
<i>I am perfect.</i>

46:59.280 --> 47:01.033
<i>But only at one thing.</i>

47:16.160 --> 47:17.958
You disgusting...

47:18.320 --> 47:19.470
...cannibal.

47:20.680 --> 47:23.559
Consumer of human flesh.

47:27.040 --> 47:31.034
There was a time when I couldn't
imagine anyone being what you are...

47:31.880 --> 47:33.872
...and doing what you do.

47:35.880 --> 47:38.190
But now I realise I'm just like you.

47:44.560 --> 47:47.200
I consume everyone I love.
