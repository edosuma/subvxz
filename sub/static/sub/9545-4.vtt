It was a hell

Mr. Monk, they're not
laughing at you.
Yeah. Right.

05:03.403 --> 05:07.499
Victim "A"- the garage attendant.
His name was Ronnie, uh-

05:07.573 --> 05:09.507
Uh, Ronald Shelton.
Shelton.

05:09.575 --> 05:13.841

05:16.282 --> 05:18.876

05:18.951 --> 05:20.919
and rolls him under this truck.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.547
Then he hangs out here
in the garage and waits.

The killer forces Kemp
over to the car...

05:39.806 --> 05:43.242
at gunpoint,
makes him put his hand
in the car door,

05:43.309 --> 05:45.709
and breaks it.

05:45.778 --> 05:48.508
He killed the first guy,
then waited around,

05:48.581 --> 05:50.879
but then only breaks
the second guy's hand?

05:50.950 --> 05:54.909
His right hand. Not his left hand.
He was very specific about that.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.512
And then he takes off.
Kemp recognize him?

05:57.590 --> 06:00.184
- No. He didn't see his face.
- Robbery?

06:00.259 --> 06:04.389
Nope.
Why his hand?
Is he a musician or a surgeon?

06:04.464 --> 06:08.230
He's a big-time stock analyst.
Works at one of the financial
places upstairs.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.065

Buyouts and mergers.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.537

06:31.991 --> 06:34.482

06:38.798 --> 06:42.564
Well, this tire iron is metric.

06:42.635 --> 06:45.035
Doesn't fit this car.

06:45.104 --> 06:48.335
In fact, all the cars down here
are American-made.

06:48.408 --> 06:53.004
I think the killer
brought this down
to pretend to change a tire.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.173
- He probably drives an import.
Good. What else?
- <i>Tweezers.</i>

06:56.249 --> 06:58.615
Well, he's insecure.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.855

act tougher than he is.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.335
Yeah? How's Kemp?
I can't release him yet.

07:21.407 --> 07:25.503
Gotta get him back
to the hospital for some X-rays.
But he gave me a message.

07:25.578 --> 07:27.978
He said to tell you
that he can meet Mr. Monk...

07:28.047 --> 07:30.572

07:30.650 --> 07:32.709

08:00.746 --> 08:03.078
Hi. Adrian Monk for Mr. Kemp.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.583
He's on a conference call.
You can have a seat.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.642
Okay.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.418
I used to work
in a place like this.

08:14.494 --> 08:18.260
I lasted about two weeks.
You do the same thing every day.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.061
Same thing.

08:21.133 --> 08:24.796
After a while, you begin
to feel like a number.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.931
A number.
You're just like everybody else.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.775

You're basically a drone.

- One more would have been

Well, apparently.
Wow.

09:32.138 --> 09:36.404
Mr. Kemp, I understand
that the man that attacked you
knew your name.

09:36.475 --> 09:39.410
That's right.
But you didn't recognize him?

09:39.478 --> 09:41.446
No. I never got
a good look at him.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.312
- Did you recognize his voice?
- No. Sorry.

09:44.383 --> 09:47.750
Any idea why somebody
would want to...

09:47.820 --> 09:50.254
break your right hand?

09:50.323 --> 09:52.951
Are you about to sign
an important contract?

09:53.025 --> 09:55.016
Well, it wouldn't matter.
I can still sign my name.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.585
I mean, if I make an "X,"
it would still be legal.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.756
So you've been
moving furniture?

09:59.832 --> 10:04.132
That's right.
I just hired a new decorator-
some feng shui nut.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.899
She says if my desk
faces the door,

10:06.973 --> 10:09.703
it would open me up
to new opportunities.

10:11.077 --> 10:13.011
Maybe she was on to something.

- Oh, impressions in the rug.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.890
The desk used to be there.

to ask me some questions.

10:41.307 --> 10:45.141
Mr. Monk, I'll admit it.
I'm scared to death.

10:45.211 --> 10:50.080
I mean, this creep knew my name.
It could be someone close to me.
I agree.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.913
The police have the building
staked out, but I need someone...

10:52.985 --> 10:55.419
working here, undercover,
trying to figure it out.

10:55.488 --> 10:59.254
I trust you.
I trust your judgment.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.658
Can you...
recommend someone, or-
I'll do it.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.753
- What?
- I'll do it.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.197
Oh, thank you.
L-I feel better already.
You can start tomorrow.

11:08.267 --> 11:11.498
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
He can't work in an office.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.595
There-There are people here.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.267
Nah, nah. He'll be fine.
I'll say you're, uh,

11:16.342 --> 11:19.436

I'm bringing in from Chicago.
- Chicago.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.776
<i>Yeah, all you have to do is,</i>
<i>you know, look busy.</i>

11:21.847 --> 11:23.781
I'll give you some reports
to collate.

11:23.849 --> 11:27.945
Did you hear that?
I'm gonna be collating.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.989

<i>So you're from Chicago?</i>
<i>It's too cold for me.</i>

11:36.696 --> 11:38.755
Not that the weather here
is much better.

11:38.831 --> 11:42.062
The kitchenette.
Some of the food in that
machine is still edible.

11:42.134 --> 11:44.625
Office humor. I love it.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.571
Sales department's down there.
This is accounting.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.575
We're redecorating
the whole office.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.577
Do you smoke? If you do,
the smoke detector...

11:52.645 --> 11:55.239
in the break room's usually
broken, if you know what I mean.

11:55.314 --> 11:57.646
Isn't that kind of a fire hazard?
I hope so.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.242
If we're lucky, this whole
friggin' place will burn down.

12:00.319 --> 12:04.085
Here's your parking pass.
If you park in the garage, make sure
someone walks you downstairs.

12:04.156 --> 12:06.590
We had a problem there
two nights ago.
Ah. I heard about that.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.423
Why do you think someone would
want to break Kemp's hand?

12:09.495 --> 12:12.760
Probably someone who heard him
playing piano at last year's
Christmas party.

12:12.832 --> 12:15.426
[Blows Raspberry]
Ah. More office humor.
That's good.

12:15.501 --> 12:18.163

This is Adrian Monk.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.784

<i>[Natalie] Everybody knows</i>
<i>about Vermont, Warren.</i>

29:54.058 --> 29:56.856
They're all talking about it.
I told you that in confidence.

29:56.928 --> 29:59.192
Natalie, I didn't tell anybody.
I swear.

Well, somebody's e-mailing
your whole office, and nobody
but you knew about it.

- Natalie, you have to believe me.
- Like hell I do.

Mr. Monk, we need to talk.
Natalie, look at this.

30:11.276 --> 30:15.713
Chilton has an alibi.
He was here Monday night.
He bowled a 294.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.010
<i>I don't know what to think.</i>

30:18.082 --> 30:20.016
Well, I think
Warren Kemp's involved.
What?

30:20.084 --> 30:23.542
Maybe the S.E.C. Was right,
that it's an inside job.
I do not trust that guy.

30:23.621 --> 30:26.419
I thought we liked him.
I thought we liked him a lot.

30:26.491 --> 30:30.222

I'll just meet you outside, all right?

Adrian! We're only down two pins.

30:33.298 --> 30:36.028

we can win the game.

30:36.100 --> 30:39.092
No problem.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.570
Foul! That's a foul!
He can't wear those.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.732
He's wearing street shoes.
They're not regulation.

30:43.808 --> 30:46.402
But he's been wearing them
the whole game.
I don't care.

30:46.477 --> 30:49.241
He can't bowl if he's not
wearing regulation footwear.
That's a rule.

30:49.314 --> 30:51.908
Fine. We'll just rent him a pair of shoes.
What size are you?

30:51.983 --> 30:54.679
Uh, here's the thing.
When you say "rent a pair,"

30:54.752 --> 30:58.586
you're talking about footwear
that other people have already worn?

30:58.656 --> 31:01.591
That's right.

- Fine. Let's just buy him a new pair.
- Pro shop's closed.

31:10.168 --> 31:12.762
So what's it gonna be?
If he doesn't bowl, you forfeit.

Here. We're about the same size.

31:21.679 --> 31:23.670

Okay, stop saying

Twenty seconds. I don't know.

We've been waiting five years
to beat these creeps.

is put on Greg's shoes...

31:56.714 --> 31:58.648
I can't.

Yes! We win!
Oh, yeah!
