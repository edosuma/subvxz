01:38.361 --> 01:43.000
The year before the genocide I
had a paratroop unit into Rwanda

01:43.025 --> 01:45.198
to help support the government troops.

01:45.905 --> 01:50.291
Our job was to train them to use a
battery of mortars but the.

01:50.292 --> 01:53.720
FPR attacked before we had
finished the training.

01:53.721 --> 01:56.200
For the record, please. The FPR?

01:56.201 --> 01:57.960
The Tutsi army.

01:57.961 --> 02:00.680
So we had to get involved ourselves.

02:00.681 --> 02:02.960
Otherwise we would have been overrun.

02:02.961 --> 02:07.721
You actually fired the guns against
the Tutsi and for the Hutu regime?

02:08.961 --> 02:10.960
Clement Barre did not.

02:10.961 --> 02:13.520
- But others did?
- Not him.

02:13.521 --> 02:15.347
But he was there?
I mean, he was on the front line?

02:15.348 --> 02:16.422
Yes.

02:16.447 --> 02:19.840
And, er, that at this moment,
during this time, he was killed.

02:19.841 --> 02:21.260
Yes.

02:21.921 --> 02:23.040
How?

02:23.041 --> 02:24.320
By an FPR bullet.

02:24.321 --> 02:26.960
So who was in overall command of the RPF?

02:26.961 --> 02:29.608
I'm sorry, the FPR,
I'm used to the English.

02:29.609 --> 02:30.720
Monsieur Ennis, s'il vous plait...

02:30.721 --> 02:32.940
Who was in command of your attackers?

02:33.841 --> 02:34.960
Alice Munezero.

02:34.961 --> 02:37.680
Alice Munezero,
the subject of this prosecution?

02:37.681 --> 02:38.880
Yes.

02:38.881 --> 02:41.800
So, in effect, in your eyes,

02:41.801 --> 02:45.201
she was responsible for
Clement Barre's death.

02:45.501 --> 02:46.661
Yes.

02:49.641 --> 02:55.800
So, er, why do military records
say he was killed in the.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.660
Central African Republic?

02:58.481 --> 03:01.960
Because we should never have fired a
gun in Rwanda and officially

03:01.961 --> 03:03.721
we never did.

03:06.601 --> 03:07.740
And then?

03:09.025 --> 03:10.420
Where do you want to go?

03:11.241 --> 03:12.561
Pascal Patenaude.

03:14.361 --> 03:18.160
A year later and the government we
were supporting had lost control.

03:18.161 --> 03:19.560
We had failed.

03:19.561 --> 03:23.568
The Tutsi army was advancing rapidly
and in response the Hutu

03:23.569 --> 03:26.880
militias began killing
the Tutsi population.

03:26.881 --> 03:28.720
The genocide had begun.

03:28.721 --> 03:33.560
After that, all we could do was help
evacuate French nationals.

03:33.561 --> 03:36.920
We heard there was a priest,
we had to go and collect him.

03:36.921 --> 03:39.180
- Patenaude?
- Yes.

03:40.088 --> 03:41.647
We arrived April 9th.

03:41.648 --> 03:43.087
April 9th...

03:43.088 --> 03:48.087
April 9th, it's almost three months
before the date you gave us

03:48.088 --> 03:50.527
- in your last interview.
- Yes.

03:50.528 --> 03:53.927
And when we found him he had gone wild.

03:53.928 --> 03:55.247
Crazy.

03:55.248 --> 03:59.324
He said there were over 200 Tutsis
in his church.

03:59.325 --> 04:00.847
Taking refuge?

04:00.848 --> 04:05.127
That he had locked them in and given
the key to The Interahamwe.

04:05.128 --> 04:07.340
- The Hutu militia.
- Yes.

04:09.488 --> 04:11.008
To do what?

04:11.301 --> 04:12.461
Kill them.

04:13.528 --> 04:18.607
He said he had no choice but he
didn't think they'd actually do it.

04:18.608 --> 04:21.608
He thought they'd just keep
them prisoners.

04:22.888 --> 04:27.380
They killed them all. Looking back
now, it's obvious, but then...

04:28.500 --> 04:31.047
Anyway, he couldn't forgive himself.

04:31.048 --> 04:33.567
He said he wanted to confess.

04:33.568 --> 04:37.687
But then this man arrived from
the secret service.

04:37.688 --> 04:39.248
Tat Picot.

04:40.288 --> 04:41.660
Yes.

04:42.128 --> 04:43.488
Why was he there?

04:44.808 --> 04:49.128
Like me, to advise the old
government, unofficially,

04:49.700 --> 04:53.708
and then to help mop up any
embarrassment when it all collapsed.

04:53.733 --> 04:56.132
Obviously, Pascal Patenaude was one.

04:56.133 --> 05:00.641
Picot spoke to him and told him if
he made this confession,

05:00.642 --> 05:03.660
the effect would be terrible
for everyone.

05:04.126 --> 05:05.286
For yourself!

05:06.816 --> 05:08.895
For our President.

05:08.896 --> 05:10.295
For our nation.

05:10.296 --> 05:11.336
Everyone.

05:12.416 --> 05:17.375
So instead he was persuaded to serve
his penance in a different way.

05:17.376 --> 05:19.989
By giving up his old identity.

05:19.990 --> 05:23.815
I think he saw it as his
rightful punishment.

05:23.816 --> 05:27.171
Either way, when Picot smuggled him
out of the country,

05:27.172 --> 05:30.255
the name of Pascal Patenaude
was left behind.

05:30.256 --> 05:31.335
Dead to the world.

05:31.336 --> 05:35.015
Which then provided for,
another opportunity.

05:35.016 --> 05:36.020
Being?

05:36.776 --> 05:38.140
Alice Munezero.

05:38.736 --> 05:39.975
We realised...

05:39.976 --> 05:42.735
Stop, stop, er, we? Who's we?

05:42.736 --> 05:45.338
Lieutenant Clement's father.

05:45.339 --> 05:46.978
Jacques Antoine Barre.

05:46.979 --> 05:50.900
Realised that this was a chance
to bring her down.

05:51.339 --> 05:54.858
If he couldn't prosecute her
for killing his own son,

05:54.859 --> 05:58.180
he could do it for killing
someone else's.

05:58.579 --> 06:00.698
- Like Madam Patenaude.
- Yes.

06:00.699 --> 06:04.298
All we had to do was change
the dates a little to match up

06:04.299 --> 06:07.539
with after Munezero's unit had
passed through.

06:08.979 --> 06:11.140
- That wasn't that simple.
- No.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.738
But Picot provided the witnesses.

06:14.739 --> 06:17.778
I backed them up and the last
judge before you,

06:17.779 --> 06:22.378
who launched the case,
worked with Barre, at the Elysee.

06:22.379 --> 06:23.779
Why would he do that?

06:25.179 --> 06:29.797
You have to understand, this case
would give us all the chance

06:29.798 --> 06:34.778
to prove that not every Tutsi was
innocent and so we were not

06:34.779 --> 06:37.818
absolutely wrong to have backed
the Hutu government.

06:37.819 --> 06:39.778
Except that you were.

06:39.779 --> 06:41.180
Absolutely.

06:44.179 --> 06:47.780
And you? Why are you telling us?

06:48.899 --> 06:51.380
Self-evidently we have failed.

06:52.819 --> 06:55.539
And, anyway, I've become tired of lying.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.620
I'm a soldier, not a politician.

06:59.379 --> 07:00.419
Or a lawyer.

07:09.619 --> 07:12.060
I'm sorry, I still don't get it.

07:14.619 --> 07:16.018
I think I've just explained.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.058
No.

07:17.059 --> 07:18.859
No, I don't think you have.

07:20.379 --> 07:23.939
Why isn't this interview being
conducted in French?

07:25.139 --> 07:28.620
Because most of the defence team
speak better English.

07:29.299 --> 07:33.259
Alice Munezero's defence team speak
better English than French?

07:33.595 --> 07:34.835
Yes.

07:34.860 --> 07:38.220
Then, Mademoiselle, you have your answer.

07:48.459 --> 07:52.738
General, I ask you to confine
yourself to your primary

07:52.739 --> 07:56.779
residence in the expectation of a
warrant for your arrest.

08:00.439 --> 08:04.418
Really? All this, just because one
side spoke French,

08:04.419 --> 08:05.618
the other English?

08:05.619 --> 08:08.099
What's the national language of
Rwanda today?

08:09.179 --> 08:10.498
English.

08:10.499 --> 08:13.218
25 years ago, it was French.

08:13.219 --> 08:14.658
It's The Great Game, Kate.

08:14.659 --> 08:18.818
Sure they're not wearing pith hats
or big moustaches any more,

08:18.819 --> 08:20.700
but they're still playing it.

08:24.899 --> 08:26.739
Win or lose.

08:35.851 --> 08:37.049
Allo?

11:14.899 --> 11:19.179
I am free.

11:19.540 --> 11:22.699
At last, I am free.

11:32.139 --> 11:37.220
After over a decade, this yoke...

11:37.819 --> 11:39.659
No...

11:40.020 --> 11:45.700
This manacle has finally been
broken from my neck.

11:46.899 --> 11:53.412
And not just mine, from around the
throats of every single Rwandan,

11:53.805 --> 11:57.565
each and every one of whom I
represent here today.

11:59.419 --> 12:03.298
This was an entirely fabricated
prosecution,

12:03.299 --> 12:07.167
placed upon me by a political, military,

12:07.168 --> 12:12.666
legal and economic elite,
intent both on masking their own

12:12.667 --> 12:16.258
personal culpability in aiding
and abetting the architects of

12:16.259 --> 12:23.018
the Rwandan genocide and who were
also determined, even today,

12:23.019 --> 12:29.218
to remind the poor, black African
that they are the ones who hold

12:29.219 --> 12:34.900
the keys to our liberty, that they
are the ones with the whip hand.

12:36.579 --> 12:39.780
But we did not accept it.

12:40.299 --> 12:45.898
By taking this action,
by proving the complete and total

12:45.899 --> 12:52.643
fallacy of their accusations,
we have snapped the collar, ripped

12:52.644 --> 12:56.700
the whip from their hands, broken
it and thrown it at their feet.

12:57.179 --> 13:00.980
And I am here today
to look them in the eye and say,

13:02.500 --> 13:07.820
"We are your equal! We are not afraid!"

13:09.500 --> 13:15.178
So now, when I return home,
my head will be held high,

13:15.179 --> 13:22.020
my past will have been reclaimed and
my future will be in my own hands!

13:22.739 --> 13:30.498
Because, at last, I am free! Free! Free!

13:58.809 --> 13:59.860
Yeah...

14:00.659 --> 14:02.179
Quite a speech.

14:04.379 --> 14:05.539
You think?

14:06.779 --> 14:08.218
You took no prisoners!

14:08.219 --> 14:10.580
Well, look what they were
trying to do to me.

14:11.619 --> 14:14.459
Doesn't give you much
of a way back, though.

14:16.099 --> 14:17.418
To where?

14:17.419 --> 14:18.500
Here.

14:20.012 --> 14:21.252
Disagree.

14:21.859 --> 14:26.818
I think this is them trying to find
a way back to us. Them saying

14:26.819 --> 14:29.700
there's a part of their past that no
longer represents them.

14:30.539 --> 14:34.060
After all, look at me! I am free!

14:36.619 --> 14:38.540
And I would not be without you.

14:40.539 --> 14:42.378
You keep the photo I gave you?

14:42.379 --> 14:44.018
Of course.

14:44.019 --> 14:47.218
Remember I said I would give you
something else?

14:47.219 --> 14:49.380
Well, today is the day.

14:52.899 --> 14:54.139
Don't be shocked.

15:01.739 --> 15:06.298
This is a scrap from the shirt you
were wearing when Ed Holt found you.

15:06.299 --> 15:09.220
They cut it off you when Eve took
you to the hospital.

15:09.899 --> 15:11.860
I kept a piece.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.738
Why?

15:17.739 --> 15:19.059
Because it's your past, Kate,

15:19.660 --> 15:22.539
it belongs to you
and I want you to have it back.

15:25.659 --> 15:29.494
But why, why now?

15:29.495 --> 15:31.339
Because you're ready.

15:35.019 --> 15:36.099
What for?

15:37.379 --> 15:38.778
Wow...

15:38.779 --> 15:39.898
What?

15:39.899 --> 15:41.738
Patrice Ganimana.

15:41.739 --> 15:42.778
What about him?

15:42.779 --> 15:46.460
They got him,
in a private hospital in London.

15:48.258 --> 15:49.298
How?

15:50.339 --> 15:51.378
I don't know.

15:51.379 --> 15:52.858
But there he is.

15:52.859 --> 15:54.338
He was in the DRC.

15:54.339 --> 15:55.780
Now he's in the UK.

15:57.019 --> 15:58.419
How did that happen?

15:59.979 --> 16:03.458
We're not sure but we are happy.
No, we are...

16:03.459 --> 16:08.138
ecstatic that this man, one of
the genocide's key architects,

16:08.139 --> 16:11.498
has finally been winkled out
from whichever deep,

16:11.499 --> 16:13.618
dank hole he has been hiding
these many years.

16:13.619 --> 16:16.298
You think he's been forced
out into the open?

16:16.299 --> 16:18.338
Who cares? As long as he's there.

16:18.339 --> 16:19.418
In London?

16:19.419 --> 16:23.818
Well, it is not only Patrice
Ganimana who is about to face

16:23.819 --> 16:26.338
the white light of public scrutiny.

16:26.339 --> 16:30.058
But it's with a western court system
that just set Alice Munezero free.

16:30.059 --> 16:31.644
From an indictment which should never

16:31.669 --> 16:33.658
have been brought forward
in the first place.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.698
Still, an incredible achievement.

16:35.699 --> 16:37.098
Yes, it was.

16:37.099 --> 16:38.778
And an impassioned speech.

16:38.779 --> 16:41.978
She'll be returning home a
national hero, surely.

16:41.979 --> 16:43.458
Of course.

16:43.459 --> 16:46.298
And... possible future president?

16:50.859 --> 16:52.500
Of course, yes.

16:53.219 --> 16:58.019
Where I come from, it is perfectly
possible to serve your

16:58.020 --> 17:00.738
country without actually
wishing to lead it.

17:00.739 --> 17:03.208
Is that why your President
faced no viable opposition

17:03.233 --> 17:04.738
during your last election?

17:04.739 --> 17:07.406
It is why we regard with
the utmost suspicion

17:07.407 --> 17:10.698
all those who would seek to instruct
us on how to behave.

17:10.699 --> 17:14.698
And yet you're happy to see Patrice
Ganimana appear before the UK courts.

17:14.699 --> 17:16.498
As I've said, many times,

17:16.499 --> 17:20.377
we are happy to see justice done
wherever it can be delivered.

17:20.378 --> 17:23.377
It is just that I have indeed said
this before, many times.

17:23.378 --> 17:27.978
So we can only hope that this time,
it actually will be.

18:58.739 --> 19:01.059
So, Michael...

19:06.779 --> 19:08.218
That is way too strong.

19:08.219 --> 19:09.258
So?

19:09.259 --> 19:10.419
So add some milk.

19:11.379 --> 19:13.338
- It's after 11.
- So?

19:13.339 --> 19:14.658
It's against the law.

19:14.659 --> 19:15.819
What law?

19:16.939 --> 19:19.578
I don't know but we're lawyers so
we have to obey it.

19:19.579 --> 19:20.619
Salut!

19:26.179 --> 19:27.818
Sure you don't want some?

19:27.819 --> 19:31.138
You should know I am not
the nominated First Aider.

19:31.139 --> 19:32.298
Don't need one.

19:32.299 --> 19:33.458
Nothing can kill me.

19:33.459 --> 19:37.100
Not today! It's official!

19:38.812 --> 19:39.852
I used to tap dance.

19:40.459 --> 19:41.579
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:44.899 --> 19:46.258
Regular Gregory Hines.

19:46.259 --> 19:47.858
Although these days it's more like...

19:47.859 --> 19:50.778
That's, er... that elephant in Dumbo.

19:50.779 --> 19:52.698
That's a little harsh.

19:52.699 --> 19:54.491
I would have settled for Dick Van Dyke.

19:55.539 --> 19:57.600
- First film I saw.
- Yeah?

19:57.625 --> 19:58.898
Yeah.

19:58.899 --> 20:01.099
The only black faces were
the chimney sweeps.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.818
I knew then I was going to have to
make a whole lot of adjustments.

20:04.819 --> 20:06.219
And yet here you are!

20:07.819 --> 20:09.098
Here I am.

20:09.099 --> 20:10.580
Completely mal-adjusted.

20:10.581 --> 20:13.778
You seemed to be able to handle
the French judiciary pretty well.

20:13.779 --> 20:16.458
Meds, they must've kicked in.

20:16.459 --> 20:20.098
Along with the un-reconciled sense
of personal anger.

20:20.099 --> 20:21.499
Yeah, and that.

20:22.459 --> 20:27.380
Well, let's see if we can get that
last bit under focus.

20:29.059 --> 20:30.900
Patrice Ganimana...

20:37.579 --> 20:41.648
So he came in from South Africa on
a Congolese passport as...

20:41.673 --> 20:43.754
Jean Sinyamenye.

20:43.779 --> 20:45.980
So no alarm in the manifests.

20:47.019 --> 20:48.938
So how come they found him?

20:48.939 --> 20:52.138
He used his own name for
the hospital admissions.

20:52.139 --> 20:54.500
They checked his records
and up he popped.

20:54.939 --> 20:56.018
That's weird.

20:56.019 --> 20:57.989
He might not have been
thinking so straight,

20:57.990 --> 20:59.818
he's in for some kind of head cancer.

20:59.819 --> 21:01.378
Looks like he's got a good chance.

21:01.379 --> 21:04.778
Unless the surgeon just cuts an
artery and has done with it.

21:04.779 --> 21:09.098
I prefer the letter of the law to
be our scalpel, if you don't mind.

21:09.099 --> 21:11.058
- For now...
- For ever.

21:11.059 --> 21:13.018
And here's how.

21:13.019 --> 21:15.876
Our old friend the European Arrest
Warrant.

21:15.877 --> 21:18.458
I had a cherry tree like this once.

21:18.459 --> 21:21.178
Nothing, and then the year
before it died,

21:21.179 --> 21:23.060
it couldn't pump 'em out fast enough.

21:24.139 --> 21:25.778
Six months from now,

21:25.779 --> 21:29.380
you're going to need a visa just to
go over there to buy a pack of fags.

21:30.899 --> 21:33.138
You think that's why he's come here now.

21:33.139 --> 21:34.978
Better chance of resisting extradition?

21:34.979 --> 21:40.621
No, he's toast, which is just about
all he can eat right now.

21:52.259 --> 21:56.299
Police! Open it.

21:58.139 --> 22:00.299
Stay there!

22:01.899 --> 22:07.458
Mr Ganimana? Patrice Ganimana?

22:07.459 --> 22:09.858
Do you speak English, Mr Ganimana?

22:09.859 --> 22:13.099
Is this the only electronic media
you have on you or in this room?

22:14.819 --> 22:18.258
Patrice Ganimana, this is a European
Arrest Warrant issued by the.

22:18.259 --> 22:20.818
Crown Prosecution Service of
the United Kingdom for your

22:20.819 --> 22:23.218
arrest and detention under article 25...

22:23.219 --> 22:24.419
Hiya!

22:28.979 --> 22:30.380
You are?

22:33.219 --> 22:35.220
Um...

22:36.499 --> 22:38.538
his lawyer. You?

22:38.539 --> 22:41.058
I'm about to arrest your client
under article 25...

22:41.059 --> 22:42.418
3a of The Rome Statute.

22:42.419 --> 22:45.178
For the enlistment of children under
15, plus a number of

22:45.179 --> 22:46.840
other indictments all issued by

22:46.865 --> 22:50.580
the International Criminal
Court, 30th August 2007.

22:51.779 --> 22:53.099
You've dropped something.

22:56.819 --> 22:58.938
I'll leave it as a tip.
Why'd you want his iPad?

22:58.939 --> 23:00.418
- As evidence.
- Of what?

23:00.419 --> 23:01.698
Contacts. Search history.

23:01.699 --> 23:04.698
You mean beyond "lump, neck, cancer"?

23:04.699 --> 23:05.818
We'll see.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.218
No need, I've had it checked already.

23:08.219 --> 23:10.858
- You see how this is going to go?
- Not till I've read him his rights.

23:10.859 --> 23:12.178
Marvellous.

23:12.179 --> 23:14.899
Let the Wild Rumpus begin!

23:19.099 --> 23:21.938
The charge sheet against this man
contains some of the worst

23:21.939 --> 23:24.178
indictments against any
individual I've ever read.

23:24.179 --> 23:27.820
Yeah,
War Crimes, Crimes Against Humanity.

23:29.139 --> 23:30.178
The Big Boys.

23:30.179 --> 23:32.938
And yet you feel it's appropriate to
make an allusion to,

23:32.939 --> 23:35.378
what was that, a children's book?

23:35.379 --> 23:37.501
Well, it's a wonderful book,
really it is.

23:37.502 --> 23:42.738
I gave... Well, actually I bought
it for all my God-children.

23:42.739 --> 23:44.820
And that was before I realised that...

23:46.099 --> 23:48.379
all they really wanted from me...

23:49.299 --> 23:50.538
was my money.

23:50.539 --> 23:53.860
And you're a God-fearing man,
are you? Mr...?

23:54.779 --> 23:57.900
Gaines, Blake Gaines.

24:00.699 --> 24:07.300
Let's see, shall we?
Go ahead, Detective, play your role.

24:10.179 --> 24:14.460
Patrice Ganimana, I am arresting you
under article 25, 3a...

24:17.219 --> 24:22.580
Why are you here? No, why
are you here, in this country?

24:25.019 --> 24:26.179
Why do you think?

24:28.185 --> 24:29.345
Ganimana?

24:33.179 --> 24:34.779
You know where Frank is?

24:36.598 --> 24:37.838
Back in Kigali.

24:39.299 --> 24:40.499
You know why?

24:42.619 --> 24:46.540
Because suddenly I am a national hero.

24:47.379 --> 24:48.498
Yes, you are.

24:48.499 --> 24:52.420
Yes, I am. And why is that?

24:53.539 --> 24:54.779
You beat the West.

24:56.459 --> 25:00.940
I beat the system. So do you know
what I have to do now?

25:02.145 --> 25:05.385
Make sure the system doesn't go
and beat me right back.

25:05.850 --> 25:10.980
I go back home and every word I say,
people will listen to.

25:12.019 --> 25:17.259
And if I tell them to support this
prosecution and it collapses,

25:17.620 --> 25:19.379
then straightaway I've lost their trust.

25:20.379 --> 25:25.900
If I tell them to reject it and it
succeeds, the same again.

25:27.659 --> 25:33.620
So until I know exactly what is
going to happen,

25:34.579 --> 25:38.100
I'm going to say nothing and stay put.

25:39.979 --> 25:41.220
It might be a while.

25:42.019 --> 25:43.460
Then hurry it along.

25:48.939 --> 25:50.740
Why did Frank go back?

25:53.259 --> 25:55.938
His personal stock has gone
through the roof.

25:55.939 --> 25:58.498
And when you run the bank...

25:58.499 --> 26:01.419
You're everyone's favourite investment.

26:05.019 --> 26:06.099
That worry you?

26:08.259 --> 26:09.858
It's all regulated.

26:09.859 --> 26:11.578
But people aren't.

26:11.579 --> 26:15.220
And he's a jumpy one, always has been.

26:16.139 --> 26:24.139
Maybe because he feels that he has
to fluff his feathers up around you.

26:25.939 --> 26:29.018
Me? I don't run a bank!

26:29.019 --> 26:30.059
No.

26:31.659 --> 26:36.620
But, you have the "key to my heart".

26:43.539 --> 26:45.339
If only that were true.

26:52.059 --> 26:55.980
Is the embassy still putting you up
at that shitty apartment of theirs?

26:59.539 --> 27:03.740
Sleeping so much better now I have a
shawl for a curtain.

27:04.339 --> 27:05.859
More worried about the mattress.

27:07.419 --> 27:09.219
Why don't you stay on mine?

27:11.619 --> 27:17.498
You are suggesting that your
mattress is less stained with

27:17.499 --> 27:21.100
bodily fluids than the one I am
presently sleeping on?

27:23.619 --> 27:27.618
Yeah, I can see what you're saying,
what I was doing there was

27:27.619 --> 27:31.258
following the logical line of the
humour and, erm...

27:31.259 --> 27:34.419
it looks, er,
like it left me rather exposed.

27:37.779 --> 27:40.820
Rare for a lawyer of your standing.

27:43.179 --> 27:44.579
Won't happen again.

28:17.379 --> 28:19.920
The fact of your client's absence

28:19.945 --> 28:23.043
places this hearing in
unusual circumstances.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.258
It does, ma'am.

28:26.259 --> 28:29.818
Mr Ganimana is undergoing an
emergency medical procedure.

28:29.819 --> 28:32.178
And, as he does not wish to put a
pause in proceedings,

28:32.179 --> 28:34.698
he's asked me to appear on his behalf.

28:34.699 --> 28:37.721
Your client is fully aware of the
extradition proceedings

28:37.722 --> 28:39.299
and its cause?

28:39.605 --> 28:40.645
Mr Gaines?

28:42.299 --> 28:43.618
He is, ma'am, yes.

28:43.619 --> 28:45.534
And, as representative of your client,

28:45.535 --> 28:48.338
are you in a position to indicate
whether or not he would be

28:48.339 --> 28:50.898
willing to consent to the
extradition proceedings?

28:50.899 --> 28:52.298
I am, ma'am, yes.

28:52.299 --> 28:54.178
And that indication is?

28:54.179 --> 28:58.098
Ma'am, my client does not consent
to the Extradition Order.

28:58.099 --> 28:59.458
On what grounds?

28:59.459 --> 29:02.338
In light of the recent tragic events
surrounding the unlawful killing

29:02.339 --> 29:06.044
of two people on the premises of the
International Criminal Court,

29:06.045 --> 29:10.618
the personal security of my client and
indeed of his legal representatives...

29:10.619 --> 29:12.738
cannot be guaranteed.

29:12.739 --> 29:14.698
Thank you.

29:14.699 --> 29:17.818
Can you offer any estimation of when
your client may be

29:17.819 --> 29:19.618
fit enough to attend court?

29:19.619 --> 29:21.418
Two weeks, ma'am.

29:21.419 --> 29:22.459
Very well.

29:42.539 --> 29:43.940
Michael!

29:55.459 --> 29:57.138
Well, my God!

29:57.139 --> 29:59.258
You really are half the man
you used to be.

29:59.259 --> 30:00.378
Thanks.

30:00.379 --> 30:02.480
But then maybe that's because you were

30:02.505 --> 30:04.298
half a man to start with, I don't know.

30:04.299 --> 30:05.538
Fuck off.

30:05.539 --> 30:06.579
Pleasure.

30:07.819 --> 30:09.658
No Legal Aid applications?

30:09.659 --> 30:13.698
Are you giving up on charitable
cases altogether?

30:13.699 --> 30:17.099
Financial lectures from a man in erm...

30:18.819 --> 30:21.380
What are those? Loakes?

30:22.019 --> 30:23.058
You noticed.

30:23.059 --> 30:24.218
Everything.

30:24.219 --> 30:30.180
Everything, Michael, and that's why
I know this case will fail.

30:30.379 --> 30:32.858
Is this how you do it? With your clients?

30:32.859 --> 30:36.259
Yes, well, you see, the thing
about limitations...

30:38.219 --> 30:39.458
I just haven't met mine.

30:39.459 --> 30:42.619
You haven't faced me in court,
though, have you?

30:44.579 --> 30:46.019
OK.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.818
Spassky v Fischer.

30:49.819 --> 30:51.018
Which one are you?

30:51.019 --> 30:52.058
Spassky.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.098
Don't always make the wrong choice.

30:54.099 --> 30:57.138
I haven't.
Choosing him over an anti-Semite

30:57.139 --> 31:01.058
with a paranoid personality
disorder, hardly a contest.

31:01.059 --> 31:05.219
Yeah, well, maybe that's why my
clients only ever pick a winner.

31:07.838 --> 31:08.998
That's me.

31:10.165 --> 31:11.285
New Chauffeur.

31:13.679 --> 31:15.199
Breaking him in.

31:17.379 --> 31:19.258
I bet you are.

31:19.259 --> 31:20.900
So I should go.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.300
I hear you've got cancer.

31:31.419 --> 31:34.220
- No.
- I understand.

31:35.379 --> 31:38.779
But how long, do you suppose,
before it comes back?

31:40.459 --> 31:42.738
Now you really should fuck off.

31:42.739 --> 31:44.379
That's not what I meant.

31:46.099 --> 31:50.540
Right now, life must feel pretty
precious to you.

31:52.139 --> 31:54.300
So don't go and waste it on this.

31:55.099 --> 31:58.020
Don't.

32:05.499 --> 32:07.540
That charitable enough for you?

32:13.899 --> 32:18.860
Shit! Shit! Shit!

32:21.619 --> 32:23.018
Yes!

32:23.019 --> 32:26.299
I have Capi Petridis, Office
of the Prosecutor, ICC.

32:26.839 --> 32:28.199
Yes, straight out, please.

32:29.019 --> 32:30.098
Michael?

32:30.099 --> 32:32.660
Capi! Tell me it's not true.

32:32.979 --> 32:34.058
It's true.

32:34.059 --> 32:36.178
Shit! Since when?

32:36.179 --> 32:37.418
Three weeks now.

32:37.419 --> 32:38.898
And you didn't think to tell me?

32:38.899 --> 32:41.046
We had to investigate it first.

32:41.047 --> 32:43.227
- And?
- And it's as you heard,

32:43.708 --> 32:48.178
12 key witnesses have withdrawn
their statements against Ganimana.

32:48.179 --> 32:51.540
You're sure? Why?

32:52.259 --> 32:53.538
Why do you think?

32:53.539 --> 32:54.858
They've been leaned on.

32:54.859 --> 32:57.577
- More like terrified.
- By who?

32:57.578 --> 32:59.980
If we knew that, we wouldn't
be where we are.

33:00.499 --> 33:01.538
Which is?

33:01.539 --> 33:04.698
I'm about to issue a formal
notice of withdrawal.

33:04.699 --> 33:06.458
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:06.459 --> 33:09.500
Without those witnesses we cannot
prosecute Ganimana.

33:10.859 --> 33:11.978
You're killing the case.

33:11.979 --> 33:14.138
No, I'm withdrawing it.

33:14.139 --> 33:15.338
You're killing the case.

33:15.339 --> 33:18.338
Without prejudice to the possibility
of bringing a new case,

33:18.339 --> 33:20.818
should additional evidence
become available.

33:20.819 --> 33:22.778
Don't use that fucking
language with me, Capi!

33:22.779 --> 33:28.018
And don't use that language with me.
We've lost 12 key witnesses.

33:28.019 --> 33:29.738
What other choice have I got?

33:29.739 --> 33:31.898
Guarantee the safety of the witnesses.

33:31.899 --> 33:34.738
You mean like I hadn't considered
all the options because I've

33:34.739 --> 33:37.338
been sitting here waiting for you to
call me to tell me what to do?

33:37.339 --> 33:39.658
I'd like you to revisit your options.

33:39.659 --> 33:41.060
OK, yeah, sure.

33:45.659 --> 33:46.698
Eunice?

33:50.139 --> 33:54.141
Euch! I'm here.

33:54.142 --> 33:55.658
I thought you were drowning.

33:55.659 --> 33:57.658
I'm having to drink a bunch of water.

33:57.659 --> 33:58.738
Why?

33:58.739 --> 34:00.778
It's supposed to stop the cravings.

34:00.779 --> 34:03.619
I don't know, feels like a shark
attack from the inside.

34:04.060 --> 34:07.260
So, our options are, we have none.

34:07.539 --> 34:09.178
There's got to be something we can do.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.275
Well... I don't know, I guess maybe

34:11.275 --> 34:15.058
we could go all in and annex
the whole of the damn Congo.

34:15.059 --> 34:17.498
Might take a few years,
might cost a few million lives

34:17.498 --> 34:20.697
but, you know, if it's the only way...

34:20.699 --> 34:23.538
The ICC has always been vulnerable
to this kind of thing,

34:23.539 --> 34:25.378
the cases it prosecutes.

34:25.379 --> 34:29.898
The locations they're in. Witness
protection will always be an issue.

34:29.899 --> 34:33.098
It's one of the major question marks
we've always had about the

34:33.099 --> 34:34.138
court's viability.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.578
Yeah, that and the fear that one day
they may try and prosecute a.

34:36.579 --> 34:38.340
US President.

34:39.099 --> 34:42.500
I'd love to see the Witness
Protection Programme on that one.

34:43.179 --> 34:46.058
Michael, am I missing something here?

34:46.059 --> 34:47.257
What?

34:47.259 --> 34:49.297
Well, as tragic as this story may be,

34:49.299 --> 34:51.058
it's actually not one we're
interested in.

34:51.059 --> 34:52.378
No, but I am!

34:52.379 --> 34:53.538
Why?

34:53.539 --> 34:56.338
Because he's a genocidaire!
He needs to be prosecuted.

34:56.339 --> 34:57.818
That isn't our destination.

34:57.819 --> 34:59.020
We agreed.

35:00.939 --> 35:03.778
He's being represented
by a fucking Rottweiler.

35:03.779 --> 35:05.018
So?

35:05.019 --> 35:07.858
So the fucker told me
I wouldn't stand a chance.

35:07.859 --> 35:09.699
This about your ego, Mikey?

35:09.980 --> 35:12.938
Some kind of dick-measuring
contest going on here?

35:12.939 --> 35:14.698
I think you know what this is all about.

35:14.699 --> 35:18.258
Nope, the male reproductive organ
is a complete mystery to me.

35:18.259 --> 35:20.418
In fact, mostly it just makes me laugh.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.298
It's about all of us.

35:22.299 --> 35:24.378
It's about you, me, Alice, Eve,

35:24.379 --> 35:27.298
all of us not repeating
the mistakes of the past.

35:27.299 --> 35:30.498
And if I have to turn away
from a case, once again,

35:30.499 --> 35:32.418
for reasons of political expediency,

35:32.419 --> 35:36.858
I don't think the old prostate
could take it, not a second time.

35:36.859 --> 35:40.578
Wait! You think
what you think makes you ill?

35:40.579 --> 35:42.658
It's something my mind keeps suggesting.

35:42.659 --> 35:45.258
A guilty conscience doesn't give
you cancer, Michael.

35:45.259 --> 35:48.018
For fuck's sake, you're not in
some Gothic novel!

35:48.019 --> 35:52.698
Eunice, I had a monk turn up in
court the other day, in full habit.

35:52.699 --> 35:54.298
I don't know what gives you cancer.

35:54.299 --> 35:56.098
Fukushima gives you cancer.

35:56.099 --> 35:59.538
But you sure as shit won't get it sitting
there dithering over the fate of some

35:59.539 --> 36:02.298
junior arsehole who just wandered
in from the Congo.

36:02.299 --> 36:03.898
Am I making myself clear?

36:03.899 --> 36:04.938
As an MRI.

36:04.939 --> 36:08.100
Good. Remember the destination.

36:08.419 --> 36:10.978
We need Alice Munezero back in Rwanda,

36:10.979 --> 36:14.802
enjoying the hero's welcome she
so richly deserves.

36:14.803 --> 36:16.019
Drop that case.

36:28.139 --> 36:29.580
Michael! Harper.

36:30.419 --> 36:32.898
Erm, you after Jenny?

36:32.899 --> 36:34.338
Ummm...

36:34.339 --> 36:35.578
She's had to go out, I'm afraid.

36:35.579 --> 36:38.618
There's some kind of emergency
case she has to hear.

36:38.619 --> 36:39.658
No.

36:39.659 --> 36:42.618
Erm, it's... Is it late? It's late.

36:42.619 --> 36:44.979
No. Not at all. Come, come on in.

36:52.619 --> 36:54.418
Can I get you something? A coffee...

36:54.419 --> 36:57.100
No, no. Thanks, Harper.

36:58.099 --> 37:01.059
Actually, if I could just...

37:01.660 --> 37:04.578
Yeah, of course, go upstairs.

37:04.579 --> 37:06.659
- Would you mind?
- No. Go on.

37:23.459 --> 37:28.499
A case I just had in France, guy
tried to get revenge for his son.

37:28.898 --> 37:31.018
Yeah, I read about it.

37:31.619 --> 37:33.578
Congratulations.

37:33.579 --> 37:36.298
He did some very bad stuff.

37:36.299 --> 37:38.458
Yeah, for which he was caught.

37:38.459 --> 37:39.619
Thanks to you.

37:40.779 --> 37:43.299
Blew his brains out in his kid's room.

37:45.339 --> 37:46.379
Thanks to me.

37:47.939 --> 37:50.258
Yes, well, he shouldn't have
tried to do what he did.

37:50.259 --> 37:51.780
No, he shouldn't have.

37:52.659 --> 37:55.020
He was only doing it for his son.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.779
I think it'd driven him mad.

38:04.179 --> 38:06.059
He'd kept it just like this.

38:08.459 --> 38:09.779
Probably wasn't wise.

38:11.540 --> 38:13.378
It's 25 years.

38:13.379 --> 38:15.338
Yeah, it was.

38:15.339 --> 38:16.858
But with Hana it's only...

38:16.859 --> 38:18.340
- Three years.
- Three.

38:19.419 --> 38:21.380
And they still think there's a chance.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.539
Of what?

38:27.939 --> 38:31.340
Maybe the kindest thing to do
is just let her go.

38:33.259 --> 38:36.338
Well, only you can decide that.

38:36.339 --> 38:37.740
You and Jenny.

38:39.579 --> 38:42.979
But if there's a chance,
you've got to hold on to it.

38:48.139 --> 38:53.579
Yeah. Yeah, yeah... yeah.

40:08.619 --> 40:11.818
- Are you OK?
- Do you know what this is?

40:11.819 --> 40:12.858
No.

40:12.859 --> 40:14.418
It's blood. My blood.

40:14.419 --> 40:15.578
Did you cut yourself?

40:15.579 --> 40:18.940
From a piece of cloth Alice gave me
just after her speech in Paris.

40:19.539 --> 40:21.820
Apparently, it's what I was
wearing when Ed Holt found me.

40:22.819 --> 40:24.858
She keeps giving me things.

40:24.859 --> 40:26.418
First it was a photo.

40:26.419 --> 40:27.498
Of what?

40:27.499 --> 40:30.938
Of, er, her, Eve, Ed, you, and now this.

40:30.939 --> 40:32.858
Why does she keep doing that?

40:32.859 --> 40:34.019
What did she say?

40:35.052 --> 40:37.172
Something about my past.

40:37.197 --> 40:38.757
Then that's what it is.

40:40.139 --> 40:41.179
Why?

40:42.179 --> 40:44.058
You're in mourning.

40:44.059 --> 40:46.739
Most people just go to the family album.

40:47.939 --> 40:51.180
Whereas with me it's just a bit
of a bloodstained cloth.

40:52.579 --> 40:54.539
Are you going to invite me in?

40:56.965 --> 40:58.005
Yeah.

41:06.019 --> 41:07.618
It's got a combination lock.

41:07.619 --> 41:09.298
I don't know it.

41:09.299 --> 41:11.780
Try 0-4-9-7.

41:22.219 --> 41:23.978
Or not.

41:23.979 --> 41:27.698
Maybe I should take it to a church
fete, give everyone a go.

41:27.699 --> 41:29.940
Win a prize.

41:32.339 --> 41:33.939
You got anything to eat?

41:41.259 --> 41:42.939
Lucky thing the milk's fresh.

41:43.939 --> 41:49.820
Yeah, well, that's a tip I picked
up from MasterChef.

41:50.699 --> 41:52.779
- Sugar.
- Really works.

42:00.539 --> 42:02.658
Did you actually shoot a polar bear?

42:02.659 --> 42:04.058
Well, yes, I did.

42:04.059 --> 42:06.420
Erm, no, I didn't, I missed.

42:07.899 --> 42:09.219
Not that I meant to.

42:10.179 --> 42:13.538
Big moment though, that, meaning to.

42:13.539 --> 42:14.619
Why did you?

42:16.339 --> 42:21.498
He wasn't coming after me... yet,
but he might've later,

42:21.499 --> 42:24.178
and that was my only chance
to get him first.

42:24.179 --> 42:26.180
- Did he come back?
- Nope.

42:27.059 --> 42:28.898
Then a lucky day for both of you.

42:28.899 --> 42:31.540
But if I'd shot him,
I wouldn't have needed luck.

42:33.259 --> 42:34.579
Why were you there?

42:35.579 --> 42:37.578
I was a lecturer for a while.

42:37.579 --> 42:39.618
We'd taken some students
on an expedition.

42:39.619 --> 42:41.218
Context! Thank God!

42:41.219 --> 42:43.858
Now I can steer the jury away from
the mental image of a couple

42:43.859 --> 42:45.778
of backpackers strung up in
your smokehouse!

42:45.779 --> 42:49.979
Whereas in fact I had admissible
exonerating circumstances.

42:51.219 --> 42:53.858
Except other people wouldn't have
thought twice about it.

42:53.859 --> 42:56.298
They'd have just pulled the trigger.

42:56.299 --> 42:57.659
Yeah, well, with me,

42:58.420 --> 43:01.859
I'm always looking to see whether
the end justifies the means.

43:03.059 --> 43:04.258
Where did you learn that?

43:04.259 --> 43:05.899
It wasn't at law school.

43:07.139 --> 43:08.179
Childhood.

43:09.299 --> 43:14.260
You know, essentially, I see Bordeaux
as a blood replacement product.

43:15.819 --> 43:19.419
Tell me about your childhood. You
already know everything about mine.

43:22.379 --> 43:23.859
My father died young.

43:24.779 --> 43:28.819
My mother saw him in me and my
step-father hated what she saw.

43:31.419 --> 43:33.619
Both a couple of outsiders, then.

43:34.539 --> 43:35.859
Backs to the world.

43:37.185 --> 43:38.412
But not in here.

43:45.259 --> 43:47.619
Do you want another bowl of that in
the morning?

43:57.139 --> 43:59.819
- I've shocked you.
- A little.

44:03.059 --> 44:04.699
Told you not to trust me.

44:06.739 --> 44:09.818
You also told me you were my
daughter replacement.

44:09.819 --> 44:11.380
And that's not true?

44:12.019 --> 44:13.658
No.

44:13.659 --> 44:15.458
I still have a daughter.

44:15.459 --> 44:19.260
And I'm not looking for a father figure,
or anything else, so we're quits!

44:22.099 --> 44:23.259
I have cancer.

44:25.699 --> 44:26.738
What?

44:26.739 --> 44:33.192
Well, erm, I mean I'm having it,
or I've had it

44:33.193 --> 44:36.773
or, at any rate,
I'm being treated for it.

44:36.774 --> 44:38.698
It's, er, it's curable.

44:38.699 --> 44:39.898
Yeah.

44:39.899 --> 44:42.178
But it's in the prostate.

44:43.219 --> 44:45.412
- You know where the prostate is?
- I know where the prostate is.

44:45.413 --> 44:48.920
Good cos, er,
they've had to operate and...

44:48.945 --> 44:50.105
I get it.

44:50.499 --> 44:54.059
You want to fall for the older man,
this is what you get.

44:57.099 --> 44:58.219
I don't care.

44:59.819 --> 45:00.859
I do.

45:04.459 --> 45:05.699
I do.

45:07.659 --> 45:11.100
Right now, you're the most
beautiful man I've ever seen.

45:12.099 --> 45:13.739
And you're the kindest.

45:16.699 --> 45:17.939
I don't mean to be.

45:20.419 --> 45:22.018
You never do.

45:22.019 --> 45:23.979
That's what I love about you.

45:28.699 --> 45:31.500
So it's not a definite "no" then?

45:32.419 --> 45:34.578
Definitely not now.

45:34.579 --> 45:37.898
More like a post-surgical sabbatical.

45:37.899 --> 45:39.099
OK.

45:40.739 --> 45:45.539
Thank God! I'd hate to see all this
go to waste.

45:45.892 --> 45:47.292
Not a chance.

45:48.059 --> 45:49.939
Best meal I've had in years.

45:57.379 --> 45:58.939
I know why you came here.

46:01.739 --> 46:03.059
Patrice Ganimana.

46:04.939 --> 46:06.819
They're dropping the case.

46:07.739 --> 46:08.779
Yes.

46:09.405 --> 46:10.485
Yes.

46:12.619 --> 46:15.020
And you know what I'm going to
tell you, don't you?

46:18.865 --> 46:20.380
Don't let them.

46:31.299 --> 46:32.459
Good morning.

46:33.979 --> 46:36.978
The International Criminal Court
and its prosecutors owe.

46:36.979 --> 46:40.898
Patrice Ganimana an apology
for bringing proceedings based on

46:40.899 --> 46:43.818
false witnesses and impugning
his integrity.

46:43.819 --> 46:47.580
Just because the case has collapsed,
doesn't mean he's innocent.

46:50.499 --> 46:51.779
I beg your pardon?

46:54.740 --> 46:59.419
If I was to accuse you, sir, of
grievous crimes against humanity...

47:00.140 --> 47:04.098
or someone else of genocide,
here on the world stage,

47:04.099 --> 47:06.338
would it make you any more guilty?

47:06.339 --> 47:11.179
Just because of the great noise that
accompanied the accusation? No.

47:13.179 --> 47:16.498
The error, and it is a great one,

47:16.499 --> 47:19.739
lies with the accusers, not the accused.

47:20.300 --> 47:24.498
In the eyes of the law, in the eyes
of justice, my client is,

47:24.499 --> 47:30.020
has always been, and will remain,
will remain...

47:32.445 --> 47:33.805
an innocent man!

47:45.059 --> 47:49.138
We have today delivered a request to
the UK government for the

47:49.139 --> 47:51.538
extradition of a Patrice Ganimana,

47:51.539 --> 47:54.738
to be tried by our own domestic courts.

47:54.739 --> 47:58.418
We accuse him of participating in
the organisation and

47:58.419 --> 48:01.618
execution of the genocide in our country.

48:01.619 --> 48:05.775
Western justice belittles our
judiciary for not being fit

48:05.776 --> 48:07.178
for purpose.

48:07.179 --> 48:10.778
But when its own system so
flagrantly fails to deliver

48:10.779 --> 48:13.258
the justice our people most deserve,

48:13.259 --> 48:16.698
then we will and we must
deliver it for them.

48:16.699 --> 48:19.848
I do this in the name of
President Mundanzi

48:19.849 --> 48:22.618
and the people of our country! Thank you.

48:30.899 --> 48:32.699
- Eunice!?
- Fuck, I feel faint!

48:35.099 --> 48:37.459
Whoa!

48:44.459 --> 48:47.380
It's OK. I'm OK.

48:48.260 --> 48:50.498
So let me try and get this straight.

48:50.499 --> 48:54.178
The ICC have dropped the Congo case
but the Rwandans want to pick

48:54.179 --> 48:56.458
- up on the genocide?
- Yes.

48:56.459 --> 49:00.258
And there's a chance Ganimana
will be extradited?

49:00.259 --> 49:01.299
Yes.

49:02.299 --> 49:05.458
And if he does, it won't go to the UN,

49:05.459 --> 49:07.578
it'll go to the Rwandan domestic courts.

49:07.579 --> 49:08.698
Yes.

49:08.699 --> 49:11.738
Then President Mundanzi's approval
rating will be so high

49:11.739 --> 49:14.618
her head will be knocking up
against the space station.

49:14.619 --> 49:15.859
Yes.

49:17.019 --> 49:19.138
That cannot happen to Alice.

49:19.139 --> 49:20.178
No.

49:20.179 --> 49:21.980
We're being outplayed.

49:22.339 --> 49:23.579
So do something.

49:24.979 --> 49:27.098
I'm sorry, David, I can't help you.

49:27.099 --> 49:30.340
Michael, Eve was your junior at the ICTR.

49:30.939 --> 49:33.858
It was under you that she gathered a
huge file on Ganimana.

49:33.859 --> 49:35.138
Not directly.

49:35.139 --> 49:37.578
And anyway, then she decided not
to pursue it which...

49:37.579 --> 49:39.298
But now we can.

49:39.299 --> 49:41.898
And I'm asking you to help.

49:41.899 --> 49:42.938
How?

49:42.939 --> 49:44.898
We'd like to see Eve's file.

49:44.899 --> 49:46.818
- They're in the tribunal records.
- No.

49:46.819 --> 49:48.459
It was never submitted.

49:53.339 --> 49:56.786
This country turned down your last
extradition request on.

49:56.787 --> 49:59.500
Article Six, right to a fair trial.

50:00.179 --> 50:01.379
Is that a "no"?

50:02.899 --> 50:04.218
You don't offer a fair trial.

50:04.219 --> 50:05.778
You are not a judge.

50:05.779 --> 50:08.660
Of people? I'm not too bad.

50:08.859 --> 50:12.619
Then I must be, because I thought
you were a better man than this!

50:45.899 --> 50:47.538
Did I leave the door open?

50:47.539 --> 50:49.058
Who was that, that just left?

50:49.059 --> 50:50.456
David Runihura.

50:50.457 --> 50:51.458
Rwanda's...

50:51.459 --> 50:54.419
Special Advisor to the President,
yes, I know.

50:56.179 --> 50:57.218
What did he want?

50:57.219 --> 50:58.938
Not now, Kate.

50:58.939 --> 51:02.520
My, my! Are you asking the little
girl to run along?

51:03.054 --> 51:05.658
Weird, because not too long ago I
got the distinct feeling you were

51:05.659 --> 51:07.338
thinking of sleeping with her.

51:07.339 --> 51:12.418
What? No, no! That's not right.

51:12.419 --> 51:13.659
What did he want?

51:15.099 --> 51:16.259
Assistance.

51:17.939 --> 51:20.298
- With the extradition?
- I can't tell you that, Kate.

51:20.299 --> 51:22.818
Because you're pissed with me?
Or because you turned him down?

51:22.819 --> 51:27.258
Because of client confidentiality,
as if I need to explain that!

51:27.259 --> 51:28.819
Is he a client of yours?

51:30.979 --> 51:32.738
- No.
- So, you just made that up.

51:32.739 --> 51:35.058
I don't know, Kate, where do you
suppose the line is between

51:35.059 --> 51:38.018
boundaries? Because you are having
such an easy time crossing them!

51:38.019 --> 51:39.789
Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure, Michael, but,

51:39.790 --> 51:42.093
you know, can you still tell me
where the centre of my life is?

51:42.094 --> 51:44.018
Or has that line just been snapped?!

51:44.019 --> 51:45.458
No.

51:45.459 --> 51:48.818
I asked you not to
let them drop the case.

51:48.819 --> 51:50.618
I thought the UN would pick it up.

51:50.619 --> 51:51.978
But not the Rwandans?!

51:51.979 --> 51:54.538
I'm actually feeling a little dizzy.

51:54.539 --> 51:57.898
You keep going on about bridges and
destinations and all that shit.

51:57.899 --> 52:00.818
But the thing is, Michael,
this is the destination.

52:00.819 --> 52:03.978
Bringing a genocidaire to justice
and if that means extraditing

52:03.979 --> 52:06.237
him to Rwanda, then what the fuck
are we waiting for?!

52:06.238 --> 52:07.939
It's not that simple, Kate.

52:08.171 --> 52:09.411
It is to me.

52:11.379 --> 52:12.859
It should be to you.

52:17.219 --> 52:19.258
Man, this is not good.

52:19.259 --> 52:20.819
You Westerners...

52:21.779 --> 52:26.180
I'm still switching the shower on
and off just to see if it works!

52:26.739 --> 52:30.178
Ganimana's lawyer thinks
we're playing chess.

52:30.179 --> 52:34.139
He's a grandiose prick,
but he has a point.

52:34.660 --> 52:36.978
So long as we are winning.

52:36.979 --> 52:41.700
He has me down as a pawn and it
seems I'm already off the table.

52:42.019 --> 52:43.540
Where am I?

52:44.019 --> 52:45.778
You're check.

52:45.779 --> 52:47.138
You cannot check a queen.

52:47.139 --> 52:48.619
You're not the queen.

52:50.939 --> 52:55.418
And if she gets Ganimana extradited,
it'll make everything you did

52:55.419 --> 52:59.139
in Paris look like nothing so much
as a curtain raiser.

53:00.299 --> 53:02.418
For her star turn.

53:02.419 --> 53:03.499
Checkmate.

53:05.419 --> 53:07.219
So we got to hope they fail.

53:08.299 --> 53:11.619
That's the thing,
Runihura came to see me today.

53:12.178 --> 53:13.298
Why?

53:13.979 --> 53:15.059
He wanted help.

53:16.339 --> 53:18.300
What did you do?

53:18.925 --> 53:19.965
I said no.

53:21.139 --> 53:23.618
We both know who that man is.

53:23.619 --> 53:29.140
We both know who Ganimana is too.
One of the world's most evil men.

53:30.245 --> 53:31.605
I should've said yes.

53:33.659 --> 53:35.979
I will bring Ganimana to justice.

53:38.059 --> 53:39.298
When?

53:39.299 --> 53:41.340
When this is done.

53:43.179 --> 53:48.020
I understand,
this must be very testing for you.

53:48.978 --> 53:50.458
Testing?

53:50.539 --> 53:52.658
Alice, my moral compass is
spinning so fast,

53:52.659 --> 53:54.619
Chuck Yeager would bail out.

53:59.179 --> 54:05.220
Ms Ashby, we have our problems, but
we are determined to overcome them.

54:06.179 --> 54:08.338
Come out and see for yourself.

54:08.339 --> 54:12.218
Our legal system has made such huge
strides in the last few years

54:12.219 --> 54:15.858
and today we are more than capable
of handling a transfer case

54:15.859 --> 54:18.258
such as Patrice Ganimana's.

54:18.259 --> 54:20.698
And if you don't take my
word then take...

54:20.699 --> 54:23.939
Holland's, Canada's, Denmark's,

54:24.540 --> 54:27.578
all of whom have recently
agreed to extradition.

54:27.579 --> 54:29.898
I'm just a junior investigator.

54:29.899 --> 54:33.340
Who was clearly of great assistance
to Alice Munezero in Paris.

54:33.859 --> 54:36.100
Now, I hope it will be the same again,

54:36.338 --> 54:39.100
but this time not just for one
person but for a country.

54:39.940 --> 54:41.659
The country of your birth.

54:43.339 --> 54:46.018
What if you didn't like what I found?

54:46.019 --> 54:49.258
Then then you would be
entirely free to say so.

54:49.259 --> 54:51.940
But I don't believe you will,
otherwise I would not ask.

54:52.939 --> 54:58.498
So, of course, in building
the case against Ganimana,

54:58.499 --> 55:01.059
we will need all the evidence we
can possibly find.

55:02.259 --> 55:06.740
You know that a file was prepared
against him for the tribunals in '97?

55:08.699 --> 55:12.780
But for some reason
they were never formally submitted.

55:16.059 --> 55:20.203
Which is particularly unfortunate

55:20.204 --> 55:23.419
when you consider who it was written by.

55:25.745 --> 55:27.300
Your mother.

55:29.179 --> 55:33.139
And we wondered if, in fact,
she might've kept a copy here.

55:33.591 --> 55:35.151
In this country.

55:38.019 --> 55:40.180
I have no idea.

55:41.179 --> 55:42.299
Why would you?

55:44.700 --> 55:47.980
But perhaps you could help us locate it.

55:50.139 --> 55:51.298
Ask Michael.

55:51.299 --> 55:52.499
I did.

55:52.985 --> 55:54.345
He said no.

55:54.859 --> 55:56.540
Which is very strange.

55:56.859 --> 55:58.059
Wouldn't you say?

56:00.580 --> 56:02.580
Ms Ashby...

56:07.339 --> 56:10.150
I believe your mother started
something

56:10.151 --> 56:12.099
very important with that file.

56:13.659 --> 56:17.020
Please help us to finish it by
bringing Patrice Ganimana to justice.

56:21.779 --> 56:25.300
Mr Gaines? I'm Kate Ashby,
Eve Ashby's daughter.

56:26.059 --> 56:27.420
Yeah.

56:28.779 --> 56:30.538
I'm sorry about your mother.

56:30.539 --> 56:33.140
Not so much you didn't use
her name in court.

56:34.059 --> 56:35.938
Well, that's all immaterial now.

56:35.939 --> 56:37.818
- Not to me.
- Of course not...

56:37.819 --> 56:40.120
Or to the families of
the 800,000 Rwandans

56:40.145 --> 56:42.098
whose murder your client helped organise.

56:42.099 --> 56:44.648
Those weren't the
charges brought against him,

56:44.673 --> 56:46.218
as I'm sure you're well aware.

56:46.219 --> 56:47.698
They will be.

56:47.699 --> 56:48.739
One day.

56:52.259 --> 56:53.898
By you, Ms Ashby?

56:53.899 --> 56:55.778
I'd surely love that.

57:04.379 --> 57:05.859
Do you play chess?

57:06.220 --> 57:08.898
I heard you already tried
that one on my colleague.

57:08.899 --> 57:11.515
I think you'll find your "colleague"
is actually your employer.

57:11.540 --> 57:16.618
But, just to let you know,
I'm definitely Bobby Fischer.

57:17.739 --> 57:21.700
Yep. Because up here...
I'm completely fucked,

57:22.900 --> 57:25.380
but the danger for you is,
I don't give a shit.

57:32.872 --> 57:34.352
Are you here to see me?

57:35.619 --> 57:36.658
I already have.

57:38.099 --> 57:40.699
Tell your client he'll never be free.

57:43.259 --> 57:47.660
Can you hear that?

57:49.678 --> 57:51.038
It's piss in my boots.

57:51.238 --> 57:53.478
You should get that checked out,
a man of your age.

57:55.779 --> 57:59.020
Yeah, and the last word goes to?

58:01.218 --> 58:02.258
Me.
