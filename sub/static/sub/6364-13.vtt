00:02.303 --> 00:03.647
.

00:03.648 --> 00:04.992
[explosion]

00:04.993 --> 00:06.337
Please accept my condolences
on the loss of your paramedic.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.639
Her name was shay, right?

00:07.641 --> 00:09.008
Unfortunately, ofi

00:09.010 --> 00:10.642
Has decided not
to pursue

00:10.644 --> 00:12.344
Adrian gish
at this time.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.278
I need your help.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.380
Sure, sis.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.514
Whatever you need.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.450
You know,
we no longer work together.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.490
Is it too late to get
my spot back in intelligence?

00:24.492 --> 00:26.392
Welcome back.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.631
Hey.
Morning, sergeant.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.433
We were going to--

00:34.435 --> 00:36.735
And a beautiful morning to
you too, officer burgess.

00:36.737 --> 00:41.273
How can i help you?

00:41.275 --> 00:43.475
We wanted to know if you
wanted us to check back in

00:43.477 --> 00:45.277
With the neighborhood
watch on roosevelt?

00:45.279 --> 00:48.480
That's a terrific
idea, burgess.

00:48.482 --> 00:52.051
Team work to help
the dream work.

00:52.053 --> 00:55.320
Here's the keys
to squad 01664.

00:55.322 --> 00:57.389
You two go out there

00:57.391 --> 01:00.426
And do some
good for this city.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.794
Are you feeling
all right, sergeant?

01:01.796 --> 01:03.162
I feel fantastic.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.363
You guys!

01:04.364 --> 01:06.131
Go on.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.633
Go on.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.737
[chuckles]

01:13.741 --> 01:14.773
There she is.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.608
Ah-ha.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.111
All right, let the
ball-busting commence.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.312
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.613
Yeah, we're just happy
to see you, lindsay.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.550
Listen, we we're thinking
about putting together

01:24.552 --> 01:27.252
A task force on how
to make coffee.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.288
Maybe you can help us arrange
a press conference for that.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.390
I got you started.
Cream, two sugars.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.391
It's real simple.

01:32.393 --> 01:35.294
I am not gonna
make you coffee.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.662
Come on,
what about you?

01:36.664 --> 01:39.098
I wasn't going
to say anything.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.299
And then lang called
and he said you left

01:40.301 --> 01:41.467
Your pant suit
at the headquarters.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.601
[laughter]

01:42.603 --> 01:43.802
Welcome back.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.305
(kevin)
yeah! Missed you a lot.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.307
You guys have no idea how good
it is to be here.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.109
Hey, kiddo,
i want you

01:50.111 --> 01:52.644
With antonio catching up
on all the old case files.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.514
I got to step out
for a moment, sarge.

01:55.516 --> 01:56.748
What's up?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.717
I'll let you know as soon
as i find out.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.121
Hmm.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.660
Hey.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.828
That's the place?

02:09.830 --> 02:12.631
Yeah, that's where
adrian gish works.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.633
And how sure are you
he's the arsonist responsible

02:14.635 --> 02:15.901
For shay's death?

02:15.903 --> 02:17.402
100%.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.337
We found the fire factory.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.605
We mapped out his fires.

02:19.606 --> 02:20.872
I mean, he basically
admitted it to severide

02:20.875 --> 02:22.474
When he confronted him.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.443
But ofi can't prove it.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.411
You know how hard it
is to prove arson.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.746
All right.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.648
Point him out to me.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.357
There.
That's him.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.425
That's him.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.528
Okay, stay back.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.365
Excuse me.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.633
You adrian gish?

02:49.570 --> 02:51.203
I am.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.505
Antonio dawson,
chicago pd.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.807
You mind if we go somewhere
and have a conversation?

02:55.809 --> 02:57.442
Regarding?

02:57.444 --> 02:59.645
Regarding you being
an arsonist.

02:59.647 --> 03:03.549
Regarding that you killed
a cfd paramedic.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.517
I've already talked
to the fire department.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.219
You're talking
to the cpd now.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.521
You're embarrassing me.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.923
I'm just getting started.

03:10.925 --> 03:12.624
I'm going to go
back to work now.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.959
Whoa!

03:13.961 --> 03:15.661
Did you just spit
in my face?

03:15.663 --> 03:16.929
I didn't spit in--

03:16.931 --> 03:18.430
Now, that's assaulting
an officer.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.431
Why'd you make this ugly?

03:19.433 --> 03:20.866
- You see it?
- I saw it.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.369
That's ridiculous.
I didn't--

03:24.371 --> 03:25.637
I'm gonna have
to call medical

03:25.639 --> 03:27.272
To make sure you don't
have any diseases.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.374
Lots of paperwork.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.676
Is everything okay, adrian?

03:30.678 --> 03:32.244
Your employee is a murderer.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.779
How's that for okay?

03:36.684 --> 03:38.450
All right, talk to me.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.787
51, including my sister,
got called to a fire scene

03:41.789 --> 03:43.889
In a storage facility.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.692
In that space were cases
of brake fluid, kitty litter,

03:46.694 --> 03:48.227
And chlorine powder.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.862
Classic arsonist material.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.331
All right, so
the guy's a pyro.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.150
It's not our problem.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.968
Along with an obituary
of leslie shay.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.770
That building explosion...

03:58.772 --> 04:01.273
This guy.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.378
I hope this
is being recorded.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.447
I've been
physically harassed.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.656
I hear you like to
start fires, gish.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.461
Only when appropriate.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.496
According to who?

04:27.401 --> 04:29.401
Fires that kill
innocent people?

04:29.403 --> 04:31.737
Yeah, i've heard about men
who do that.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.472
Men who kill
their own families.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.642
Men who wipe out city blocks
with a single match.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.278
[yawns]

04:39.280 --> 04:40.579
How challenging is that?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.447
A stupid cow burnt
this city to the ground.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.583
Exactly.

04:44.585 --> 04:48.453
The challenge would be to get
away with it more than once.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.923
It would take a very special cow
to do it over and over

04:51.925 --> 04:54.459
And over
again for years.

04:58.766 --> 04:59.998
Go ahead.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.867
Show me how you do it.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.836
[inhales deeply]

05:04.838 --> 05:07.639
Always underestimated.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.475
You got away with it this long
out of sheer dumb luck,

05:10.477 --> 05:12.611
Not because you're special.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.613
Thankfully, the cfd
turned us on to you,

05:14.615 --> 05:16.081
And there's nothing
we like better

05:16.083 --> 05:17.783
Than to correct
god's mistakes.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.453
Now i see it.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.388
See what?

05:23.390 --> 05:25.457
The paramedic who came in
my office and accused me.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.025
She's your sister, right?

05:28.796 --> 05:31.963
So she dialed up
a little police brutality.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.532
How'd you know she
was a paramedic?

05:33.534 --> 05:34.733
I follow the news.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.436
She was at the fire
where leslie shay died.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.404
Gabriela dawson.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.779
You just gonna tiptoe
right to the edge, huh?

05:47.781 --> 05:49.881
(antonio)
i promise you i'll stand right
behind you

05:49.883 --> 05:51.650
To give you
the last push.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.019
God's mistake?

05:54.021 --> 05:55.854
God's mistake?

05:55.856 --> 05:58.490
Really?
You think i was made by god?

05:58.492 --> 05:59.758
[chortles]

05:59.760 --> 06:02.928
Last i checked,
fire was the devil's tool.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.569
I'm warning you,
detective.

06:10.571 --> 06:14.773
Do not push me.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.074
Or what, gish?

06:16.076 --> 06:19.578
You gonna burn me up?

06:19.580 --> 06:23.115
When i'm done with you,

06:23.117 --> 06:25.784
You're gonna burn
yourself up.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.123
[knocking on door]

06:31.125 --> 06:33.625
All right, all right,
not another word.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.494
I'm assuming he wasn't allowed

06:35.496 --> 06:38.463
To contact his attorney
as was his right?

06:38.465 --> 06:40.165
Your client volunteered
to talk to us.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.000
(lawyer)
well, he's done volunteering.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.869
Unless my client
is being arrested,

06:43.871 --> 06:45.804
Then we will be
leaving now.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:54.581 --> 06:54.813
.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.815
Adrian gish.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.917
Cfd is sure he blew up
the building

06:58.919 --> 07:00.886
That killed leslie shay.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.755
I for one agree with them.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.758
I got the mother of all
bad hits off this guy.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.795
Gish works at herald mortgage
company as a proofreader.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.897
Lives at 2947 west 21st.

07:11.899 --> 07:12.998
Alone.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.533
No known relatives in chicago.

07:14.535 --> 07:17.036
What's his rush?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.538
According to kelly severide,
he's an excitement arsonist,

07:19.540 --> 07:22.607
Lives in the shadows and gets
off on the chaos of the act.

07:22.609 --> 07:27.612
This guy killed leslie shay,
my sister's best friend.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.548
Years ago, he killed peter
mills' father,

07:29.550 --> 07:32.117
And burned chief boden
and who knows how many others.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.618
As far as i'm concerned,

07:33.620 --> 07:35.754
We don't sleep
until this lunatic roasts.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.022
I hear that.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.023
So how do we handle him?

07:38.025 --> 07:40.158
We get under his skin.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.661
Make him feel us
everywhere he looks.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.696
Arson is hard to prove unless
you catch him in the act,

07:44.698 --> 07:46.665
So that's what we're gonna do.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.634
Pressure the volcano and be
there when it erupts.

07:49.636 --> 07:53.138
Olinsky and ruzek,
roll to his workplace.

07:53.140 --> 07:57.075
Apparently, antonio caused a
little stir there this morning.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.944
My experience is,
the office gossips

07:58.946 --> 08:01.813
Will be bursting to talk
to us about this guy.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.032
The rest of you,

08:04.033 --> 08:06.250
Find a common link between
the victims of these fires.

08:06.253 --> 08:09.054
I want a warrant
for this home address asap.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.822
And make sure you include
all electronics

08:10.824 --> 08:11.857
In the body of the warrant.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.225
Of course.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.030
Hey, alvin, adam?

08:19.032 --> 08:21.600
I'm just checking if you
need a patrol team

08:21.602 --> 08:23.268
To assist you with your
busy case load today.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.737
We're always here
to help intelligence.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.739
No, that's okay.
Thanks.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.075
Well, cheers to you, then.

08:35.782 --> 08:36.847
Watch this.

08:36.850 --> 08:37.849
What're you gonna do?

08:37.851 --> 08:39.083
I don't know.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.220
Hey, sarge?

08:42.222 --> 08:44.188
Hey, how can i help you?

08:44.191 --> 08:46.658
Do you mind if i swap
shifts tomorrow?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.629
I think we can
work something out.

08:50.631 --> 08:51.763
Oh, great.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.899
'cause i have this
cake-making class,

08:53.901 --> 08:55.767
And the lesson
is on layering,

08:55.769 --> 08:57.736
And i'm so afraid
if i get behind,

08:57.738 --> 09:00.172
I will never really catch up

09:00.173 --> 09:02.607
'cause it's like
trigonometry, you know?

09:02.609 --> 09:04.576
I do know.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.311
And i don't like it.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.916
I love it.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.819
I mean, caminetto can
swap out with you, right?

09:16.256 --> 09:17.756
Thank--
yeah, thank you.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.124
And save me a piece,
for me, okay?

09:19.126 --> 09:22.694
'cause that's just
yum yum in my tum-tum.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.034
Thank you.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.871
Hi.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.006
Is adrian in trouble
or something?

09:35.008 --> 09:37.742
You tell us.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.645
He's never been anything but
a perfect employee...

09:40.647 --> 09:42.747
Then today...

09:42.749 --> 09:44.616
How long's he worked here?

09:44.618 --> 09:47.085
I came on eight years ago
and inherited him.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.087
So before that.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.325
Rachel!

09:53.327 --> 09:55.961
Will you bring me
adrian gish's work file?

09:55.963 --> 09:57.762
Of course.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.765
Look, what we do
isn't exciting.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.669
We write mortgage reports
and adrian proofreads them.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.638
I mean, he comes in,
he's super organized,

10:06.640 --> 10:09.240
And he doesn't involve himself
with office politics,

10:09.242 --> 10:11.276
Which, believe me,
happen here

10:11.278 --> 10:12.744
When you get three people
in a room.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.813
Anything ever burn down
around here?

10:14.815 --> 10:17.749
Any employees' houses
catch fire unexpectedly?

10:17.751 --> 10:19.184
Not that i know of.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.753
I don't even think he smoked.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.955
Thank you.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.126
His resume says he started
here in 2004.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.761
Mind if we have
a look at that?

10:34.234 --> 10:35.867
Hey, smart guy.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.669
Kellogg business school
at northwestern.

10:37.671 --> 10:38.770
Yeah.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.308
Dr. Miller?

10:43.310 --> 10:44.643
Yes.

10:44.645 --> 10:45.910
Hi. Detective halstead
and lindsay.

10:45.912 --> 10:46.945
Hi.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.813
Thanks for meeting us.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.649
Adrian gish's resume
said that he went

10:50.651 --> 10:52.684
To kellogg for his mba.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.285
You're listed as one
of three professors

10:54.287 --> 10:56.054
On his advisory committee.

10:56.055 --> 10:57.822
We're just hoping you could tell
us some more about him.

10:57.824 --> 10:58.990
I remember adrian.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.826
Anyone who was here
at that time does.

11:01.828 --> 11:02.827
Gifted.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.928
In what way?

11:03.930 --> 11:05.797
He would light up a room.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.600
Intellect, charm.

11:08.601 --> 11:11.402
I remember thinking, this young
man will be a senator some day.

11:11.405 --> 11:13.839
A senator?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.274
He never saw his wheelchair
as a disadvantage.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.342
I remember when--

11:17.344 --> 11:18.710
Did you say wheelchair?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.178
Yes.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.149
Muscular dystrophy,
i think it was.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.184
This man?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.285
No.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.319
I don't know who that is.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.388
Okay, thank you
for your time.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.791
Thanks.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.993
All right, we need to go
to the registrar's office

11:34.995 --> 11:36.761
And see if they have an
alumni address

11:36.763 --> 11:38.029
For the gish that
actually went here.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.230
Yep.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.935
[knocking on door]

11:47.708 --> 11:48.707
Yes?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.075
Mrs. Gish?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.176
Yes.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.877
I'm piper gish.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.714
Mother of adrian gish?

11:55.716 --> 11:57.082
Yes.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.483
Do you know where he is?

11:58.485 --> 11:59.784
I'm sorry?

11:59.786 --> 12:02.320
We're looking for your son.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.722
How dare you?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.056
Ma'am--

12:05.058 --> 12:08.159
Adrian was killed in
an office fire 12 years ago.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.794
They didn't have
wheelchair ramps.

12:09.796 --> 12:10.462
Only an elevator.

12:10.464 --> 12:12.497
He didn't--

12:12.499 --> 12:14.766
He was trapped.

12:14.768 --> 12:17.068
So this isn't your son?

12:24.277 --> 12:25.777
This is him.

12:25.779 --> 12:29.748
This is adrian.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.783
We're sorry to bother you.
We made a mistake.

12:31.785 --> 12:32.784
What is this about?

12:32.786 --> 12:33.818
Police business, ma'am.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.820
Very sorry.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.160
If that guy's gish,

12:42.162 --> 12:44.395
Who the hell is our guy?

12:48.769 --> 12:49.000
.

12:49.002 --> 12:52.103
How the hell did arson
investigation not know that gish

12:52.105 --> 12:53.371
Is operating under an alias?

12:53.373 --> 12:54.506
Well, they aren't cops.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.307
They're about accelerants
and incendiaries

12:56.309 --> 12:57.809
And the causes
of a fire.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.211
It took them this long to even
know it was arson.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.548
Give us a minute.

13:05.051 --> 13:08.319
My client legally changed his
name ten years ago.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.288
And stole an identity
in the process.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.525
My client's birth name
was ross clayton mcgowan,

13:13.527 --> 13:16.261
And this is to inform you

13:16.263 --> 13:19.230
That i have formally lodged
complaints with the ipra,

13:19.232 --> 13:21.900
The i.G.'s office,
and will be suing.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.535
File away.

13:23.537 --> 13:26.237
They probably have pre-printed
"voight" forms ready to go.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.581
So...

13:36.583 --> 13:38.883
So...

13:38.885 --> 13:43.288
So just 'cause i'm back doesn't
mean i want to quit me and you.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.195
I don't know.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.230
I'm not really a
sneak-around-behind-dad's-back

13:52.232 --> 13:53.264
Kind of guy.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.233
Says the guy that
works undercover.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.035
[laughs]

13:57.037 --> 13:58.970
Let's just come clean.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.873
Voight will respect us more
if we look him in the eye.

14:01.875 --> 14:05.877
Or we keep our personal
lives personal.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.345
It's nobody's business
but ours.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.080
[knocking on door]

14:09.082 --> 14:10.281
Hey, voight wants
to move out.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.250
Yep, got it.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.251
To be continued.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.452
Yep.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.322
(voight)
there they are.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.257
Hey, sergeant, i need
to borrow burgess and roman.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.992
Of course, hank,
whatever you need.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.110
(voight)
thanks.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.227
This is ross mcgowan,
aka adrian gish.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.295
We want you to follow him.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.597
All right,
we'll get changed.

14:25.599 --> 14:27.332
No.
This guy's a smart cookie.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.167
We're gonna throw him
a wrinkle. Come on.

14:38.345 --> 14:41.045
Okay, sergeant,
we are good to go.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.962
Police!
Search warrant!

14:59.633 --> 15:01.132
Clear!

15:01.134 --> 15:02.500
Where do you want me
to stick this warrant?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.669
Just tag it to
the front door.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.271
All right, toss the place.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.006
Make it messy.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.208
Pull up the floorboards
if you have to.

15:14.214 --> 15:18.016
Can i get one cheese,
large?

15:18.018 --> 15:19.684
Here.
Keep the change.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.386
Hey, thanks.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.394
Let me get a couple
of slices of sausage, please.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.929
Cpd eats free here.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.363
Oh, no, we can't--

15:32.365 --> 15:34.565
Sure, we can.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.103
Can we get a couple
of sodas too?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.171
Yeah.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.673
Diet for my partner.

15:41.675 --> 15:44.142
Hilarious.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.110
Thank you.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.317
Pies almost ready, sir.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.351
Sorry to make you wait.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.153
Not a problem.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.695
(burgess)
hey.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.630
Should we follow him?

16:06.599 --> 16:08.700
He left his cell phone.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.037
If he's not back in
a minute i'm gonna--

16:13.039 --> 16:14.572
I'm not worried.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.507
Do you ever worry?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.343
When you got shot,
i worried.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.644
The way platt's
acting this week,

16:19.646 --> 16:21.045
That's got me worried.

16:21.047 --> 16:22.313
But no, not usually.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.482
I don't know
how you do that.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.251
I concentrate on the
important things.

16:27.253 --> 16:30.421
Oh, i'll have to
start trying that.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.594
Yeah, i'm gonna go see
if he's--

16:36.596 --> 16:38.229
Here you go.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.433
Here you go.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.044
Are you two following me?

16:53.046 --> 16:55.046
We're just out
on patrol, sir.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.782
Nice weather, huh?

17:02.655 --> 17:05.423
Lindsay, halstead,
gish thinks he spied us.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.338
Got him.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.098
Wait, is he...

17:47.100 --> 17:48.099
Son of a bitch.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.534
[knocks on window]

17:53.640 --> 17:55.473
For the district.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.141
Extra cheese.

17:58.511 --> 18:01.245
You're underestimating
me again.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.314
[explosion]

18:25.105 --> 18:25.336
.

18:25.338 --> 18:29.607
Maybe we should have worried.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.775
You heard?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.176
I heard.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.811
I don't know what
to tell you, sergeant.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.346
It happened so fast...

18:35.347 --> 18:36.880
Just so i'm clear, the guy
you were tailing got free

18:36.883 --> 18:39.750
From your sight, snuck
out a bathroom window,

18:39.752 --> 18:42.487
And then molotov cocktailed
your squad car.

18:42.489 --> 18:46.390
Okay, the details are a bit
more complex then that--

18:46.392 --> 18:48.626
But basically yeah,
yes, sergeant.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.728
And you didn't
arrest him why?

18:50.729 --> 18:52.829
Because halstead and lindsay
said we need something bigger.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.800
Bigger than one
of my squad cars?

18:59.772 --> 19:03.374
These things happen.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.844
The important thing is
that you two are unharmed.

19:06.846 --> 19:11.482
Listen, don't let the behavior
of others affect your day today.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.519
Do some good out there.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.350
All right,
out with it.

19:29.351 --> 19:31.801
Who is that man and what
is he holding over you?

19:31.804 --> 19:34.405
Fine.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.840
He works for the
city bureau

19:35.842 --> 19:37.875
Of disciplinary action
or something.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.343
I don't know.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.478
He's monitoring me.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.512
I knew it!

19:41.514 --> 19:42.847
Just keep your voice down.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.482
Okay.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.816
How long is
this gonna go?

19:45.818 --> 19:47.518
I don't know.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.888
Someone anonymously complained
about my people skills.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.823
Said i was droll
and demeaning.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.859
Can you believe that?

19:54.861 --> 19:56.377
No.

19:56.378 --> 19:57.894
I love being the desk
sergeant here, burgess.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.565
I mean, i really love it.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.500
If they took that
away from me,

20:02.502 --> 20:06.370
Put me behind some desk
in the ivory tower, or worse...

20:06.372 --> 20:08.306
Early retirement,

20:08.308 --> 20:09.840
I don't know what i'd do.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.310
That could happen?

20:12.312 --> 20:13.444
Okay, you want to bury me?

20:13.446 --> 20:14.912
Now's your chance.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.316
Just walk over to him
and pour your heart out.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.785
- Hey, herlihy!
- Yo, sarge.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.421
How's the family?

20:25.391 --> 20:26.591
Hey, how you doing?

20:26.593 --> 20:27.992
I've been better.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.227
You remember megan?

20:29.229 --> 20:30.228
Of course.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.362
Good to see you.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.730
Sorry about
the circumstances.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.298
You guys close
to finding this guy?

20:34.300 --> 20:35.967
We're gonna get him,
i promise.

20:35.969 --> 20:37.868
He's obsessed with
being underestimated

20:37.870 --> 20:39.804
And he's going to crack.

20:39.806 --> 20:40.905
Chief.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.306
Hey.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.910
So here's the map
from the ifo logs.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.412
With all the suspected arsons
going back to 1970.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.848
We don't know how far gish
goes back with all this,

20:50.850 --> 20:52.984
But figured the more information
you had, the better.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.619
His name's not gish.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.687
He's been using a fake
identity for a long time.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.456
We don't know how long.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.757
He torched
a patrol car yesterday.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.891
- You serious?
- Yeah.

21:00.893 --> 21:01.892
It's actually a good sign.

21:01.894 --> 21:02.994
Our plan is working.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.695
This helps too.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.631
Atwater, why don't you and me
cross-reference all these fires

21:06.633 --> 21:08.499
With the name ross mcgowan
and see what pops.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.268
Pardon me.
What did you say?

21:10.270 --> 21:12.336
Ross mcgowan,
gish's birth name.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.705
That is not his birth name.

21:14.707 --> 21:15.840
What's that, chief?

21:15.842 --> 21:17.975
Ross mcgowan
was a firefighter.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.310
He died in the same fire

21:19.312 --> 21:20.945
That killed peter mills'
father, henry.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.814
Same place i got my scars.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.850
So mcgowan's a fake id too.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.018
Going back 20 years.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.724
Who is this guy?

21:33.726 --> 21:34.959
Huh?

21:34.961 --> 21:36.861
Thanks, guys.

21:36.863 --> 21:37.862
We'll update you as soon as
there's anything to update.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.380
Yeah.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.897
Please don't tell me
this means you guys aren't--

21:40.900 --> 21:41.966
Megan, look at me.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.934
This prick is going down.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.645
Hey, sis.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.013
Voight's just frustrated because
we're all taking

21:56.015 --> 21:57.915
This a bit
personally now.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.751
Antonio, you looked into
that man's eyes, right?

22:00.753 --> 22:01.819
He's not human.

22:01.821 --> 22:02.953
He's not even an animal.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.388
He's darkness.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.690
I know it.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.591
You need to arrest him,

22:07.593 --> 22:09.026
You make something up,
get him,

22:09.028 --> 22:11.062
Throw him in the pit,
and never look back.

22:11.064 --> 22:13.431
It doesn't work like that.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.533
Voight does.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.034
I've seen it.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.471
Wow.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.039
Haven't you come
full circle on voight.

22:22.041 --> 22:25.443
Well, what
are you doing?

22:25.445 --> 22:26.911
My job.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.730
[scoffs]

22:28.731 --> 22:30.548
Man, everyone keeps
saying that.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.583
Because it's the truth.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.585
You may not want
to hear it,

22:34.587 --> 22:36.687
But i believe
in the system, gabby.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.790
Because at the end
of the day, it works.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.894
Now, we're gonna catch gish
in the act,

22:43.896 --> 22:45.896
And he's gonna spend the
rest of his pathetic life

22:45.898 --> 22:47.865
Right where he belongs.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.100
Locked up.

22:49.102 --> 22:50.568
Alone.

22:50.570 --> 22:54.672
In the darkness,
like you said.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.441
I really hope you're right.

22:57.443 --> 22:58.709
Before he kills
somebody else.

22:58.711 --> 23:02.780
Because if he does,
that's on you.

23:13.860 --> 23:14.091
.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.810
All right,
we know his age,

23:15.811 --> 23:17.528
We know his weight,
we know his face.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.662
Anyone been in the
interrogation room since him?

23:18.664 --> 23:19.997
No, i don't think so.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.599
Then his prints
are on the table.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.800
Let's run 'em
through ncic and leads.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.000
We'll see if we get
a pop or a match.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.169
O and ruzek
are on him, right?

23:25.171 --> 23:26.437
- Yeah.
- Good.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.571
Let's keep pushing
this bastard.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.407
I don't want
to wait much longer.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.878
Sorry, one second.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.717
Excuse me.

23:39.719 --> 23:40.718
Excuse me.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.986
Sir?

23:41.988 --> 23:43.754
I've worked with sergeant platt
for a while now,

23:43.756 --> 23:46.624
So i think i have some
good perspective.

23:51.664 --> 23:55.866
Okay, she would kill me for
saying this, but...

23:55.868 --> 24:00.538
She is an amazing
woman and cop.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.872
Nobody cares more
about this district

24:01.874 --> 24:03.207
Than sergeant trudy platt,
okay?

24:03.209 --> 24:05.476
She runs it firmly
and fairly

24:05.478 --> 24:07.511
And with a...

24:07.513 --> 24:10.581
Just ton of charisma.

24:10.583 --> 24:11.916
Hmm.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.517
Charisma.

24:14.587 --> 24:16.687
Anyway, i wanted you
to know that.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.589
Thank you.

24:18.591 --> 24:19.590
Officer burgess, is it?

24:19.592 --> 24:20.958
That's right.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.527
Uh--guh--
no, my pleasure.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.001
Hardware store?

24:31.003 --> 24:32.169
Yeah.

24:32.171 --> 24:35.172
Want me to stay back,
guard your car?

24:35.174 --> 24:37.875
I've been looking to
trade this in anyway.

24:39.479 --> 24:40.845
Let's go.

24:42.849 --> 24:45.516
(gish)
danger...

24:45.518 --> 24:47.485
Flammable...

24:47.487 --> 24:49.553
Gas...

24:49.555 --> 24:51.121
Under...

24:51.123 --> 24:53.757
Pressure...

25:21.687 --> 25:26.590
Do you know why arson
is so hard to prove?

25:26.592 --> 25:27.758
Why don't you tell us?

25:27.760 --> 25:31.595
Because fire
eats itself.

25:31.597 --> 25:34.565
Destroying all the evidence.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.967
It's as if
you had a gun...

25:36.969 --> 25:40.671
Used it in a murder,

25:40.673 --> 25:43.707
And then the gun
self-destructed.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.643
Poof!

25:45.645 --> 25:47.011
Why don't you tell us more?

25:47.013 --> 25:49.914
About the fires you started?

25:49.916 --> 25:53.284
Get it out in the open?

25:53.286 --> 25:55.152
You know you want to.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.589
Excuse me.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.126
I tried.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.963
[register beeping]

26:05.965 --> 26:07.131
I can take you over here.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.166
I'll wait.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.038
How you doing today?

26:14.040 --> 26:15.306
Dandy.

26:15.308 --> 26:16.574
And you?

26:16.576 --> 26:19.109
Oh, getting by.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.345
Oh, um...

26:21.347 --> 26:24.181
I hope you don't mind
my asking, but...

26:28.754 --> 26:30.821
A fire?

26:30.823 --> 26:33.357
I was trapped in one
at my old school.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.992
I don't remember much
about it.

26:36.662 --> 26:39.363
Lucky to be alive,
they tell me.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.632
Was it the school fire
at august ele--

26:41.634 --> 26:45.235
Elementary on 38th,
about...

26:45.237 --> 26:48.672
8 or 9 years ago?

26:48.674 --> 26:50.240
Yeah, it was.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.376
(gish)
i remember that.

26:52.378 --> 26:55.012
A nasty one.

26:55.014 --> 26:58.215
Glad you made
it out okay.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.651
(woman)
me too.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.686
And thank you.

27:02.688 --> 27:05.856
This will be
$62.67.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.024
You know what?

27:07.026 --> 27:08.892
I decided i don't
want any of it.

27:11.697 --> 27:14.932
I'm going to the grocery store
next if you want to come.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.667
We're gonna take
you up on that.

27:20.373 --> 27:23.641
Don't worry about him.

27:23.643 --> 27:26.810
(voight)
yeah.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.812
Thanks, al.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.651
Olinksy says gish
has old burn scars

27:33.653 --> 27:35.219
From a fire on his arm.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.320
We can use that.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.288
We know he changed ids
at least twice

27:38.290 --> 27:39.890
Going back 20 years.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.960
What do we know
about psychopaths?

27:42.962 --> 27:44.795
They work up to
their first kills

27:44.797 --> 27:46.830
And usually aren't very
careful in the early going.

27:46.832 --> 27:50.267
So either gish burned
himself starting a fire,

27:50.269 --> 27:52.002
Or more likely,

27:52.004 --> 27:54.138
He suffered
an inciting incident,

27:54.140 --> 27:56.407
And that's what
set him off.

27:56.409 --> 27:58.308
Exactly.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.327
In the interview room,

28:00.328 --> 28:02.345
Gish mentioned men
who kill their own families.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.281
Let's look at some
of the earlier fires

28:04.283 --> 28:05.382
In the bridgeport area,

28:05.384 --> 28:06.800
See if maybe there was one

28:06.801 --> 28:08.217
That took out a family except
for one little boy.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.358
Hey, we got one!

28:14.360 --> 28:16.694
Fire in bridgeport
in 1975.

28:16.696 --> 28:17.428
(jay)
killed a mom,

28:17.430 --> 28:18.996
A husband, a brother.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.764
There was one surviving
child at the time.

28:20.766 --> 28:22.466
He was age 7,
trenton lamont.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.101
You got an address?

28:24.103 --> 28:25.736
3424 south green street.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.004
Let's hit it.

28:42.421 --> 28:43.787
Hey.

28:43.789 --> 28:45.856
Excuse me.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.291
Excuse me.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.425
You lived here long?

28:48.427 --> 28:50.394
Just my whole life.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.830
You here when this
place burned down?

28:52.832 --> 28:54.398
Yeah,
the lamont family.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.966
How come no one
ever rebuilt?

28:55.968 --> 28:59.269
The son who survived,
he still owns the property.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.437
Trenton.

29:00.439 --> 29:01.755
Trenton lamont.

29:01.756 --> 29:03.072
You ever have
any contact with him?

29:03.075 --> 29:04.475
Yeah, all the time.

29:04.477 --> 29:05.509
Lives right there.

29:05.511 --> 29:06.744
What?

29:06.746 --> 29:09.046
Yeah, never left the area.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.247
Saw him last week.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.116
He comes and goes
at weird times,

29:12.118 --> 29:13.484
Been always nothing
but nice.

29:13.486 --> 29:15.285
This him?

29:15.287 --> 29:16.887
Yeah, that's him.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.189
Trenton lamont.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.291
Let's go.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.889
Clear back here.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.390
Hey, in here!

30:00.132 --> 30:01.198

30:18.050 --> 30:21.885
Oh, my god.

30:21.887 --> 30:23.053
Al, you got eyes on gish?

30:23.055 --> 30:24.888
Yeah, he's entering
a grocery store

30:24.890 --> 30:25.889
On roosevelt as we speak.

30:25.891 --> 30:27.124
We're letting him--

30:27.126 --> 30:28.392
He's targeting gabriela!
Snatch him up!

30:28.394 --> 30:30.861
Move to arrest,
move to arrest!

30:34.533 --> 30:37.401
He's sending out
false texts.

from silvy brett

they're gonna say--

33:54.366 --> 33:56.400
They're gonna say that
you made a mistake,

33:56.402 --> 33:57.667
And the cops are gonna know

33:57.669 --> 33:59.770
That they
didn't underestimate you.

34:02.241 --> 34:05.275
You will ruin your legacy,

34:05.277 --> 34:07.344
What you worked so hard for.

34:07.346 --> 34:08.612
Wrong.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.415
This finishes my legacy.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.565
Hey!

34:28.567 --> 34:29.599
Who are you?

34:29.601 --> 34:31.068
What's going on?

34:31.070 --> 34:32.101
Whoa, hey,
i just work here, man.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.135
I got a call
the elevator was stuck.

34:33.138 --> 34:34.737
You smell that?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.239
It's gasoline.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.674
Keys.
What floor is it stuck on?

34:37.676 --> 34:39.076
Between three and four.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.744
Here.
Wait out there.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.347
I was destined for it.

34:44.349 --> 34:45.348
To burn.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.384
[gabby coughing]

34:47.386 --> 34:49.786
To be consumed
in the chaos of fire.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.088
No, don't.

34:51.090 --> 34:52.856
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.762
Do you know the story
of the phoenix?

34:58.764 --> 35:01.665
It's a beautiful bird that
at the end of its life,

35:01.667 --> 35:06.670
Settles into a nest
and sets itself on fire...

35:06.672 --> 35:10.607
And a new phoenix is born
from the ashes.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.254
I will rise again, see?

35:24.256 --> 35:27.357
Stronger, better.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.335
[gunshot]

35:38.337 --> 35:39.402
[gasps]

35:42.541 --> 35:44.875
Gabby!

35:44.877 --> 35:45.909
I'm okay.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.445
[panting]

35:54.486 --> 35:55.919
Oh, god!

35:55.921 --> 35:58.355
[coughing
and gasping]

35:58.357 --> 35:59.456
You okay?

35:59.458 --> 36:01.358
[gasping]
yeah, yeah.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.426
[coughs]

36:09.868 --> 36:12.469
Antonio.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.704
That's fine police work
today, brother.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.306
Yeah, thanks.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.641
You all right?

36:17.643 --> 36:19.309
Me?

36:19.311 --> 36:20.877
I'm glad i saved
the courts the trouble.

36:20.879 --> 36:21.912
Hey, you and me both.

36:21.914 --> 36:24.447
Hey, you're coming,
right?

36:24.449 --> 36:25.682
Yeah.

36:25.684 --> 36:26.816
See you in a minute.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.759
[shudders]

36:45.637 --> 36:50.273
Devil in the
white city.

36:50.275 --> 36:52.442
Back in hell
where he belongs.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.252
Hey.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.253
- Hey.
- Hey, chief.

37:03.255 --> 37:04.521
Hey, chief,
how you feel?

37:04.523 --> 37:07.390
How do i feel?

37:07.392 --> 37:09.859
God, i wish there was a word
to encapsulate it all.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.294
How about happy?

37:11.296 --> 37:13.296
I mean, i'm happy the
son of a bitch is dead.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.799
No, happy
is not the word.

37:15.801 --> 37:18.468
I'm just...

37:18.470 --> 37:21.638
I don't know.

37:21.640 --> 37:25.342
I don't know, i'd say
happy works for me.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.877
I just might get some sleep
for the first time in months.

37:29.514 --> 37:32.382
I hear right?

37:32.384 --> 37:34.317
Yeah.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.319
They...

37:36.321 --> 37:38.355
They got him.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.728
Thank you.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.329
Thank you.

37:51.303 --> 37:53.336
God, i need a beer.

37:53.338 --> 37:55.305
Yeah.

37:55.307 --> 37:56.973
Maybe you were right.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.042
Maybe happy
is the word.

38:00.279 --> 38:01.945
- Here's to happy.
- Cheers.

38:07.753 --> 38:08.818
I almost--

38:08.820 --> 38:11.821
Shh.
Hey.

38:11.823 --> 38:12.822
Come here.

38:12.824 --> 38:15.325
We're all good.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.895
You did it.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.664
I'm fine.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.532
We're all fine
thanks to you.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.834
Yeah.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.437
We're fine.

38:30.742 --> 38:34.311
[knocking on door]

38:47.426 --> 38:48.992
Hey, if you want to tell
hank, we can tell him.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.060
I don't want
to talk about hank.

38:50.062 --> 38:52.462
What do you want--

38:55.667 --> 38:57.734
I don't want
to talk at all.

38:59.338 --> 39:00.937
I've heard
of a puff piece,

39:00.939 --> 39:02.872
But this is a whole bag
of puffs.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.343
What's going on, sergeant?

39:06.345 --> 39:08.445
Ah, just a little article

39:08.447 --> 39:10.413
The <i> sun-times</i> wrote
about yours truly.

39:10.415 --> 39:13.383
Nice of them to recognize
the little people, you know?

39:13.385 --> 39:16.453
(sean)
"officer kim burgess, a beat co
in platt's district told me,

39:16.455 --> 39:19.389
No desk sergeant in the city
has as much charisma

39:19.391 --> 39:20.657
As sergeant trudy platt."

39:20.659 --> 39:21.624
You said that?

39:21.626 --> 39:23.026
God, i love that word.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.127
Charisma.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.396
I got to remember that one.

39:26.398 --> 39:27.764
You lied to me.

39:27.766 --> 39:31.434
My mother's gonna read this.

39:31.436 --> 39:33.570
You...

39:33.572 --> 39:35.138
Are unbelievable.

39:35.140 --> 39:38.908
Yeah, but with charisma.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.077
Well, at least we got a couple
of nice shifts out of you.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.946
Yeah, that quota's
done for the year.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.432
So quit sitting
around like a piss bum

39:45.433 --> 39:47.917
On the first of the month and
get out and patrol, officer.

39:48.453 --> 39:49.886
Hey.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.589
Hey, spencer for hire,
you seen lindsay?

39:52.591 --> 39:54.157
What?
No.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.158
Why?

39:55.160 --> 39:56.960
'cause i got
a package for her.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.329
She texted me.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.697
She said that she had
to see her mom or something.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.904
So what was so important you
couldn't tell me over the phone?

40:07.906 --> 40:10.907
Okay, erin...

40:10.909 --> 40:12.575
Is this about teddy?

40:12.577 --> 40:14.043
Teddy?
No, no, no.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.111
Nothing to do with teddy.

40:15.113 --> 40:16.446
Teddy's great.

40:16.448 --> 40:17.814
As a matter of fact,
he's really good.

40:17.816 --> 40:20.049
He's enrolled in some
night classes at ccu.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.118
- Yeah.
- Hotel management.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.522
What then?

40:25.524 --> 40:27.991
Well, i quit my job
at the bar

40:27.993 --> 40:29.159
And now i'm working the desk

40:29.161 --> 40:30.927
At johnny's rental
truck company.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.629
Which is great.
It's all good.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.197
It's good.

40:34.199 --> 40:36.099
It's just that there's
this one customer

40:36.101 --> 40:39.469
Who keeps renting from us.

40:39.471 --> 40:43.773
Eight times
in the last month.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.642
I mean, we have our
repeat movers, you know,

40:45.644 --> 40:49.479
But eight times?

40:49.481 --> 40:52.649
I just get a really
bad vibe off this guy.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.517
A bad vibe off
a rental customer

40:54.519 --> 40:57.220
Is why you had me come
all the way down here?

40:58.890 --> 41:01.691
When he returned
his last rental,

41:01.693 --> 41:03.526
I found this
in the back.

41:05.764 --> 41:08.198
I think he killed
somebody.
