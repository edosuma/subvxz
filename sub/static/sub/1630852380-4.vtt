WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:08.383
(playing gentle melody)

00:08.425 --> 00:09.926
(stops playing)
I can't remember the last time

00:09.968 --> 00:11.594
we had a quiet morning together.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.138
I know.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.597
I wish we could somehow
freeze this moment.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.141
That's a great idea.

00:16.182 --> 00:17.600
Let's do that.

00:17.642 --> 00:20.061
Well, if we're gonna
freeze a moment...

00:20.979 --> 00:23.565
...how about this one?

00:25.233 --> 00:26.943
(squeaks)

00:26.985 --> 00:29.070
What the duck?
(children laughing)

00:30.363 --> 00:31.865
You couldn't let
your parents have

00:31.906 --> 00:33.324
five minutes alone,
could you?

00:33.366 --> 00:35.618
Believe me, you're not
getting this duck back

00:35.660 --> 00:37.370
any time soon.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.997
(gasps)

00:39.039 --> 00:40.248
LIAM:
Hey.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.500
I'm sorry,
didn't mean to wake you.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.752
Especially
since it looked like

00:43.793 --> 00:45.086
you were dreaming
about something fun.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.130
Me? No, no, no, no.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.965
Just a totally average,

00:49.007 --> 00:51.134
boring dream.
Didn't mean anything.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.511
Where are you going off to,
and, more importantly,

00:53.553 --> 00:55.221
is that infinity scarf
going with you?

00:55.263 --> 00:57.766
The producers who own
the movie rights to my book

00:57.807 --> 00:59.809
want me to meet with some
hotshot indie director.

00:59.851 --> 01:02.020
Now, if I can get her
on board,

01:02.062 --> 01:03.688
they might finally turn it
into a movie.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.066
Liam, that's unbelievable.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.567
It's still a long shot.

01:07.609 --> 01:08.902
This isn't the first time
they've showed interest.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.612
Well, they'd be idiots
not to turn

01:10.653 --> 01:12.781
The Biggest Payday
into the biggest blockbuster.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.115
You're gonna crush
that meeting.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.409
Without, uh, this.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.249
I think we're supposed
to celebrate

01:23.291 --> 01:24.542
after the meeting goes well.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.087
Right, yes.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.506
It's just this role reversal
is pretty hot.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.258
I mean, hustling in the mornings
is usually my thing.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.219
Yeah, what are you
gonna do today?

01:34.260 --> 01:36.054
Anything but my
job, I guess.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.889
Because, you know,
my self-worth can't be

01:37.931 --> 01:39.808
just about building
a massive media empire

01:39.849 --> 01:42.018
or blazing trails
as a female CEO.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.021
Although, you know, if it were,
I'd be fine with that.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.857
Okay, but you said that
you were gonna use this time

01:47.899 --> 01:49.651
to figure out who you can be

01:49.692 --> 01:51.861
beyond Fallon the CEO

01:51.903 --> 01:53.905
to feel more fulfilled.

01:53.947 --> 01:54.948
Not just fine.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.991
Right. I did.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.202
And I'm not gonna figure
that out by lying in bed

01:59.244 --> 02:00.537
all day.
Mm-mm.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.455
Although maybe ten more minutes.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.998
No.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.917
I'm kidding. It is time
for me to expand my life

02:05.959 --> 02:07.877
and seize the day.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.088
Mm, I can't believe this is

02:10.130 --> 02:11.965
our first breakfast-not-in-bed

02:12.006 --> 02:13.591
since we were
reunited by fate

02:13.633 --> 02:15.635
and I was
falsely accused of murder.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.886
You don't hear me complaining.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.763
Neither am I.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.223
I just want to catch up.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.766
Clothed.

02:21.808 --> 02:25.228
Hey, I am on board with that.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.021
Whenever you want.

02:27.063 --> 02:30.525
The next few days are packed
with errands and business

02:30.567 --> 02:33.528
for the skin care line launch
with Adam.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.822
Oh, you mean
your psycho son

02:35.864 --> 02:38.491
who tried to frame you
for murder?

02:38.533 --> 02:40.952
Top of the morning to,
uh, well, both of you.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.497
I forgave Adam.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.333
And I would do the same thing
if you framed me for murder.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.751
But make no mistake.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.587
Alexam is my company.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.423
Adam is a measly two letters
on the back-third of the name.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.091
Well, then why do
you even need him?

02:55.133 --> 02:56.718
I'm throwing him a bone
to keep him happy,

02:56.759 --> 02:58.761
since I stole
most of his company.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.680
Plus he is a doctor.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.266
And his participation helps
legitimize the product.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.393
Well, I still don't trust him.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.812
Or, uh... him.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.397
Dex?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.191
Things are going great.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.484
Look, just make sure he's
into you for you, okay?

03:13.526 --> 03:15.445
And not some dream
version of you

03:15.486 --> 03:17.155
he invented
when he was in college

03:17.197 --> 03:18.364
and you were
Blake's hot new wife.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.743
Look, I just don't want
to see you hurt.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.164
DEX:
So...

03:26.206 --> 03:28.750
I guess I'll see you when you're
done with all your... stuff.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.919
Unless...

03:30.960 --> 03:34.130
you would like to come with me.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.382
And maybe we could catch up

03:36.424 --> 03:37.717
in between tasks?

03:37.759 --> 03:39.552
Sure.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.471
I think I can clear my schedule.

03:41.512 --> 03:44.057
Mmm, perfect.

03:44.098 --> 03:46.226
Thanks for agreeing
to meet today.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.353
Of course I'm here, Mr. CEO.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.146
Mr. Interim CEO.

03:50.188 --> 03:53.274
Oh, same thing. I was ecstatic
when your assistant called.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.818
I have something
I wanted to run by you.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.570
But what's
with the formalities?

03:57.612 --> 04:00.657
I'm getting acquainted with
Fallon Unlimited's FSN slate

04:00.698 --> 04:03.117
and you're part of that,
so I'm gonna jump right in.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.286
Your FSN sales have stalled.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.289
So now is the time
for your next move.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.457
Couldn't agree more.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.626
Well, FSN airs internationally,

04:11.668 --> 04:15.171
yet your brand doesn't sell well
outside of the U.S. market.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.465
It's time you took
Dom-Mystique global.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.676
Have you seen the news
about NordicStar Airlines?

04:19.717 --> 04:22.595
They're accepting submissions
to overhaul all their uniforms.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.347
I did hear about that.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.975
Landing a contract like this
would be a dream.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.936
Yeah, and would literally
take your brand worldwide.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.355
But it's a dream.
NordicStar only works

04:32.397 --> 04:34.649
with award-winning designers,
which I will

04:34.691 --> 04:37.235
eventually be,
but I'm not there yet.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.028
However...

04:39.070 --> 04:42.323
I... want to enter Fashion

04:42.365 --> 04:44.742
Fest East
and compete

04:44.784 --> 04:46.995
for the Plume d'Or Award.

04:47.036 --> 04:49.664
Past winners have gone on
to do big things

04:49.706 --> 04:51.207
on the international stage.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.710
I want to be more

04:53.751 --> 04:55.378
than a ready-to-wear
designer,

04:55.420 --> 04:57.255
but I have to do it
at the right pace

04:57.297 --> 04:59.382
and with the right help.
So...

04:59.424 --> 05:02.927
any chance you can make
a call for me?

05:02.969 --> 05:05.054
(waves crashing)

05:08.141 --> 05:10.351
Thank God, there you are!
I've been looking everywhere

05:10.393 --> 05:12.478
for you. Today
is the first day

05:12.520 --> 05:15.148
of the rest of my life,
and I need your help.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.483
Well, I was just about
to set my daily intention.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.027
But I can pull a card
for you next.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.778
What? No, I said I needed help,

05:20.820 --> 05:23.156
not a scene from Hocus Pocus.
Okay.

05:23.197 --> 05:26.200
Well, you're not getting
anything with that rude 'tude.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.661
Look, I'm sorry, it's probably
just my anxiety talking.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.748
I realized
that my life has been one...

05:31.789 --> 05:34.667
singular, perfectly pitched
note when it really should be

05:34.709 --> 05:36.461
more like an Etta James
featuring Stevie Nicks

05:36.502 --> 05:37.837
harmony-packed power anthem.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.380
Huh?

05:39.422 --> 05:41.049
I need to be more well-rounded.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.301
I have to explore what
fulfills me outside of work.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.261
I mean, I can't spend my
whole life in the boardroom.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.305
Oh, no,
I'm not falling for this.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.432
Fallon Carrington is all work,
all the time.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.893
And I will not be used
as your alibi

05:51.934 --> 05:53.561
to sneak back into the office
like you did with Liam.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.481
No, I'm serious.
I am more than just my job.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.067
I just need your help
figuring out what that more is.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.111
I mean, you're always so good
at redefining yourself.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.822
Well, it's true,
I am quite multitalented.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.657
When I was 14, I...

06:06.699 --> 06:09.243
Okay, we're still talking
about me-- let's stay on topic.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.705
Of course I'll help you.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.917
(Cristal straining)

06:15.958 --> 06:18.711
BETO:
Don't waste your time, hermana.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.464
You're not getting out of here
even if your hands are free.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.801
This psychotic plan of yours
is never gonna work.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.677
Sorry, sweetie.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.846
It totally is.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.808
I just waited for your husband
to leave his computer open

06:31.849 --> 06:33.643
long enough to get
the account numbers

06:33.684 --> 06:35.395
needed to complete the transfer.

06:35.436 --> 06:36.854
Did you call the lawyer?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.356
He's working
on the documents now.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.274
And will call me directly
when they're ready.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.110
Then I'll sign
my name--

06:42.151 --> 06:43.903
well, your name--

06:43.945 --> 06:45.321
on the dotted line,

06:45.363 --> 06:47.031
collect a handsome check
from your brother,

06:47.073 --> 06:50.076
and be on my very merry way.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.161
Flores Incorporado will be
back where it belongs.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.704
With me.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.706
You gave up your right
to the company

06:55.748 --> 06:57.208
the day you left México.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.252
When Blake figures this out,

06:59.293 --> 07:01.629
he's gonna kill you... both.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.714
I hate to break it to you,

07:03.756 --> 07:05.967
but he couldn't be
more oblivious.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.219
Blake, like the
rest of the family,

07:08.261 --> 07:10.805
barely notices me. You.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.182
Us?
You won't get away with this.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.809
(in Cristal's voice):
Oh.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.019
But we already have.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.147
♪ ♪

07:27.029 --> 07:28.489
I know the book can read
like a standard drama,

07:28.531 --> 07:30.032
but I think the movie has
the potential to be

07:30.074 --> 07:31.909
so much more.
In the right hands, of course.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.786
So what do you think?
You interested?

07:33.828 --> 07:35.621
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.541
But my schedule is kind of
all over the place these days.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.501
Do the producers have any idea

07:40.543 --> 07:42.086
of when they'd like
to start shooting?

07:42.128 --> 07:43.754
Well, they would work
around your schedule.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.256
Of course. Uh...

07:45.298 --> 07:47.008
This is a rough calendar
that they've sent me.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.218
You'll probably understand it
better than I do.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.429
Hey, what are you doing here?
Hey.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.185
Nina.
Wow, I really hoped
I'd never have

07:57.226 --> 07:59.395
to see you and your delicate
sensibilities ever again.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.230
Oh, you mean my manners?

08:02.356 --> 08:05.026
So you two clearly
know each other?

08:05.067 --> 08:07.320
Unfortunately. It was 30 minutes

08:07.361 --> 08:08.905
of my life I'll never get back.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.198
Let's not make it 31.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.491
I have work to do.

08:11.532 --> 08:14.118
Pardon the interruption,
milady.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.955
Oh.
You're friends with that guy?

08:19.165 --> 08:21.667
(stammers)
I wouldn't say friends.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.544
I don't like to label.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.046
He, uh, used to work
for the Carringtons.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.215
Well, this has been informative.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.383
I think I have
all I need from you.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.427
Oh, should I have the producers
reach out to your people?

08:31.469 --> 08:34.055
Don't worry about that.
We know where to find you.

08:37.016 --> 08:40.186
She is stylish. She's graceful.

08:40.228 --> 08:42.772
She's a badass CEO, but now...

08:42.813 --> 08:45.233
she is so much more.
Please meet...

08:45.274 --> 08:47.527
Fallon the professor.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.445
Eh, I'm much less of a teacher

08:49.487 --> 08:50.863
and more of a doer. Next.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.615
What about Fallon the artiste?

08:52.657 --> 08:53.991
Oh, you mean like Alexis

08:54.033 --> 08:55.743
and her creepy dog paintings?
Pass.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.286
Uh, what about
an ambassadorship?

08:57.328 --> 08:58.829
You could be a diplomat.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.331
I feel like
you're missing the point.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.208
I'm not looking
for more employment.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.252
I am looking
for more fulfillment.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.962
I need something
that feeds my soul.

09:06.003 --> 09:08.089
Okay. More fulfillment.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.800
Let's see, um...

09:10.841 --> 09:12.176
(mutters)

09:12.218 --> 09:13.803
Aha!

09:13.844 --> 09:16.389
Fallon the philanthropist.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.890
Ooh.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.433
Yeah.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.185
That could work.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.521
I mean, that might
just check all the boxes.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.856
I've chipped in for plenty
of worthy causes over the years,

09:25.898 --> 09:27.692
it's just
that none of them were mine.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.110
They were the foundation's.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.695
Or court-mandated.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.197
Giving back is a great way
to be more well-rounded.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.700
I just need to find something
that speaks to me, you know?

09:35.741 --> 09:38.035
Beyoncé has housing.
Bill Gates has health care.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.579
Paul Newman had salad dressing.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.872
What do I have?

09:41.914 --> 09:43.874
Uh...

09:43.916 --> 09:46.294
(gasps)
(horse neighs)

09:46.335 --> 09:47.837
Horses.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.422
Oh, uh...

09:49.463 --> 09:51.257
A hot cowboy staying

09:51.299 --> 09:54.343
at La Mirage just told
me about, um, the, uh...

09:55.344 --> 09:57.221
Heroic Hooves Foundation.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.348
I do love horses.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.891
And this place has
community programs

10:00.933 --> 10:02.643
where I could really make
a difference.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.562
This could be right.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.731
I think it is, and now
I'll finally have an excuse

10:06.772 --> 10:08.899
to buy that fringe vest
I've been online stalking.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.943
This isn't about expanding
my wardrobe, Sam,

10:10.985 --> 10:13.279
it's about expanding my life.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.324
Although I'll never say no
to fringe.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.367
(chuckles)
Hey.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.620
Kirby.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.622
Thanks for stopping by.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.957
Of course.
Jeff never asks for favors,

10:24.999 --> 10:27.251
so whatever you're cooking up
must be important.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.295
Beyond. I officially

10:29.337 --> 10:31.756
entered the Fashion Fest lineup.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.467
But my competitors are
some heavy hitters.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.010
Usually are.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.637
30 designers,

10:37.678 --> 10:39.972
three looks,
including a...

10:40.014 --> 10:41.057
showstopper, right?

10:41.098 --> 10:42.350
You do know your stuff.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.269
The theme this year is
"the divine."

10:45.311 --> 10:46.937
Kind of like me.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.939
If I could win
that award,

10:48.981 --> 10:52.526
the high fashion society
will welcome me with open arms.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.445
I'm loving your
color story.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.905
And the draping.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.239
Thank you.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.283
But I need some accessories.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.243
Which is why I wanted you.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.870
I remember you did

11:02.912 --> 11:05.206
that campaign
with Randall Byers last year.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.249
You wore
those crystal headpieces.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.168
Can you make
an intro?

11:09.210 --> 11:11.003
I don't know, Dom.

11:11.045 --> 11:14.173
I haven't spoken to anyone there
in over a year, and I'd

11:14.215 --> 11:15.675
rather not...
If you can find a way

11:15.716 --> 11:17.259
to make an intro,
I'll put you in the show.

11:17.301 --> 11:20.179
Thanks, but no thanks.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.764
I don't model anymore.
You don't?

11:21.806 --> 11:23.057
No, it's just not something
I'm interested in.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.517
You know, been there, done that.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.185
I don't even read Vogue.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.854
Winning this award
would mean a lot to me.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.817
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.697
Okay, I'll call Randall.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.115
But that's
all I can do.

11:39.156 --> 11:40.658
Okay, I owe you big-time.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.203
Greyhound, extra grapefruit,
right?

11:44.245 --> 11:47.123
Oh, did I hear you
say "greyhound"?

11:47.164 --> 11:50.209
You know mixing grapefruit
juice with your medication

11:50.251 --> 11:51.419
is not allowed.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.254
Oh, my God... you're right.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.339
I totally spaced.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.258
Mitchell just emailed me
a contract

11:57.299 --> 11:59.593
to transfer Flores Inc.
back to Beto.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.303
What the hell's
going on?

12:01.345 --> 12:03.431
Wait, why did
he send that to you?

12:03.472 --> 12:05.224
Well, the company's under
the Carrington family trust,

12:05.266 --> 12:07.226
which means we both have to sign
off on it, but more importantly,

12:07.268 --> 12:09.061
why are you trying to give
the company back to Beto?

12:10.020 --> 12:11.439
(sighs)

12:11.480 --> 12:13.691
Breaking ties with Beto

12:13.733 --> 12:15.609
and taking over
the family business

12:15.651 --> 12:17.903
is just a lot for me.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.530
Oh, you're just anxious.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.157
The company's fine,
it's making money.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.492
I'm not gonna sign off
on the transfer right now.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.619
We can circle back to it
in a few months.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.875
(woman speaks indistinctly
in distance)

12:30.916 --> 12:33.085
(horse neighs)

12:33.127 --> 12:35.421
It feels nice
getting my hands dirty

12:35.463 --> 12:37.047
for a good cause.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.924
And all while inspiring
the next fashion trend.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.676
Revival ranch.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.179
Yeah, but I'm not sure
this is the answer.

12:43.220 --> 12:46.140
You know, I was hoping for fewer
blisters and a bigger spark.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.767
No one's gonna say,
"Oh, Fallon Carrington,

12:47.808 --> 12:49.560
the one who unloads hay
for charity."

12:49.602 --> 12:51.937
PATTY (chuckles):
Fallon Carrington unloading hay?

12:53.439 --> 12:54.899
OMG, it is you.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.984
Wow! Patty.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.402
It's been forever.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.196
(both chuckling)

13:02.114 --> 13:03.699
Patricia de Vilbis. Uh...

13:03.741 --> 13:06.076
Fallon and I used to compete
on the junior equestrian

13:06.118 --> 13:08.996
circuit together.
Aw, isn't that
just the cutest?

13:09.038 --> 13:11.665
No, it really wasn't.
So what are you doing here?

13:11.707 --> 13:14.919
I got involved with
the foundation a few years ago.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.879
TBH, despite having it all,

13:16.921 --> 13:18.589
I still felt
like something was missing.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.883
Well, I know the feeling.
It's actually the reason

13:20.925 --> 13:23.219
why I decided
to take a break from the grind

13:23.260 --> 13:25.304
of running
my majorly successful company.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.598
Well, good on ya.
Mm-hmm.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.016
I really wish
that I could stay and chat,

13:29.058 --> 13:30.476
but I have to finish prep
for this auction.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.812
Oh, uh, what kind of auction?

13:32.853 --> 13:35.064
You know, the kind
where fancy racehorses

13:35.105 --> 13:38.442
are auctioned off
to support the foundation.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.486
It was good to see you.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.907
Well, she's fun.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.450
And likes to abbreviate.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.285
So, should
we head out?

13:48.327 --> 13:50.329
We can find something else
that will light your fire.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.707
I think we just did.

13:59.922 --> 14:03.050
So, Brigitte, are you ready
for the big showstopping move?

14:03.092 --> 14:06.512
Okay, let's talk
this through once again.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.390
Strut, strut, strut,

14:09.431 --> 14:11.559
hit your mark, strike a pose,

14:11.600 --> 14:14.103
release the button, jacket
falls into the dress,

14:14.144 --> 14:16.814
strike another pose,
slay, delay,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.691
then walk away.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.901
Do you think maybe I could take
the dress home to practice?

14:20.943 --> 14:23.112
And what about
Randall's headpieces?

14:23.153 --> 14:24.530
KIRBY:
They're here!

14:24.572 --> 14:27.408
And they're crowns, Brigitte.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.993
Maybe you can
come back

14:29.034 --> 14:31.704
tomorrow morning a little early
and practice, okay?

14:31.745 --> 14:33.914
Mm-hmm. Good night.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.958
Oh, thank you so much
for making this happen.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.626
Isn't it amazing?

14:37.668 --> 14:39.461
Oh, Kirby,
get the finale skirt.

14:39.503 --> 14:40.588
(gasps)

14:43.674 --> 14:45.843
What is it? You don't like it?

14:45.885 --> 14:49.013
No, the dress is stunning,
but this tear is not.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.973
(whimpering)

14:52.725 --> 14:54.184
Brigitte must have snagged it.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.020
What now?
I don't know.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.063
I can't just sew it back
together. It will look terrible.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.649
I'm going to have to get
more fabric and...

15:00.691 --> 15:02.735
start over. Oh, God.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.153
LIAM:
Hey, Michael.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.404
Look, I know you're working.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.864
I just have a quick favor
to ask.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.699
No problem. I'm actually
glad you stopped by.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.367
I'm sorry about earlier.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.785
I didn't realize it was Nina

15:11.827 --> 15:13.537
until it was too late
to turn around.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.415
Yeah, look, about that,
Nina is actually why I'm here.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.417
What's the deal with you two?

15:18.459 --> 15:20.419
We went on a bad date.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.379
Actually it was
more like half a date.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.006
Which was more than enough time
to realize

15:24.048 --> 15:26.008
that we were meant
to be far apart.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.343
Well, I'm trying to convince her

15:27.384 --> 15:29.094
to direct a movie
based off my book.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.596
But now she's

15:30.638 --> 15:32.556
not answering any
of my calls or-or my texts.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.308
Which is probably for the best.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.477
You don't want Nina
anywhere near your project.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.562
She's stubborn
and self-involved.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.190
Yeah, right,
but she's a director.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.692
And there won't be
a project without Nina.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.986
Which is why I'm-I'm
asking, as a favor...

15:46.028 --> 15:48.155
can you call her and apologize?

15:48.197 --> 15:51.075
Apologize? For what?

15:51.116 --> 15:52.743
Look, I don't know.
For whatever you did.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.995
All I know is-is that the
meeting was going great

15:55.037 --> 15:56.956
until you stopped by and
she saw that we were friends.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.582
Oh, right, that's
because she's also judgmental

15:58.624 --> 16:00.000
and has no manners.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.377
Look, I helped you
dodge a bullet.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.671
You should actually
be thanking me.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.756
I'm not gonna thank you.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.675
Well, I'm not going
to apologize.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.721
Tony the gardener was able

16:12.763 --> 16:15.265
to track down 30 variegated
monsteras for me.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.018
I want the penthouse
to look jungle chic.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.729
Oh. Sure,
I understood all that.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.815
We just need to carry
them out one at a time.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.358
And by "we," I mean "you."

16:24.400 --> 16:25.943
Because I just got
a new gel set.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.319
Is that okay?

16:27.361 --> 16:28.821
Otherwise, I can have
Tony help me.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.115
No way. I am good to go.

16:31.156 --> 16:34.493
Do you not remember that I stole
this house back from you?

16:34.535 --> 16:37.663
I mean, memory problems
are common at your age.

16:37.705 --> 16:38.872
I remember
that you're a jackass,

16:38.914 --> 16:40.207
so I think
I'm doing okay.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.917
I'm just here because Tony

16:41.959 --> 16:43.293
procured some plants
for me.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.795
Well, you know,
Tony doesn't work

16:44.837 --> 16:46.213
here on Tuesdays anymore.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.674
So you and your paid
companion can leave.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.509
He's not an escort,
you moron.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.511
Well, at least not a paid one.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.680
I should pay you to
spend time together.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.598
(chuckles)
Which I now realize

16:56.640 --> 16:59.018
sounds like the plot to
Pretty Woman, so forget that.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.144
Hey, Blake.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.604
It's Dex Dexter.

17:02.646 --> 17:06.108
Oh... Farnsworth.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.693
Yes, it has
been a while.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.486
His father was on
the board at C.A.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.196
back when my father
was running things.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.949
Nice to meet you.
And well done, Alexis.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.620
Is something wrong
with your wife, Blake?

17:18.662 --> 17:21.665
More than usual, I mean.
You know,
I think she was being polite.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.459
You're probably
not used to it.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.711
Wait.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.213
I know.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.007
You finally had
that surgery.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.426
The one where the doctor
removes the stick from your ass.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.887
(chuckles) Oh.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.722
Do you want my doctor's info?

17:36.764 --> 17:38.265
He's a miracle worker.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.392
Although it may take more
than that to help you.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.977
BLAKE:
Okay.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.437
Well, this has been fun.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.646
I'm sure that you can
find your way out.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.106
Oh, I will.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.150
Just as soon as Dex

17:48.192 --> 17:50.152
puts my plants
in the car.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.279
Lead me
to your fertile soil.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.240
KIRBY:
Why is this fabric
so hard to find?

17:55.282 --> 17:57.284
It's a specialty import.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.119
I never dreamt
I'd need more of it.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.246
And we've called every store
east of the Mississippi.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.540
Fashion Fest is tomorrow,

18:03.582 --> 18:05.709
and I don't have a finale look,

18:05.751 --> 18:07.461
which means...

18:07.503 --> 18:10.047
it's time to pivot.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.673
Sure, pivot.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.634
What do you mean by "pivot"?

18:13.675 --> 18:15.094
Pivot. Think outside of the box.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.428
Something different.

18:16.470 --> 18:19.014
In all that time
you modeled last year,

18:19.056 --> 18:21.183
did anything
like this ever happen?

18:21.225 --> 18:22.810
I guess so.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.978
You kind of work with what
you got and roll with it.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.981
I think I can do that.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.819
See, this is more
what I was picturing.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.612
Well, you do blend right in.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.197
I'm talking about the horses.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.949
(gasps)
Specifically...

18:36.990 --> 18:39.326
this one, wow.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.954
Hi, girl.
Hi, Leonora.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.539
This was such
a big part of my life.

18:43.580 --> 18:44.957
Why did I give this up?

18:44.998 --> 18:47.126
Well, you know,
you grew up, matured.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.503
Well, I'm just glad that
something finally brought me

18:49.545 --> 18:51.088
back to this place.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.714
And to you--
isn't that right, girl?

18:52.756 --> 18:55.259
She's gorge, isn't she?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.469
She is perfect.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.264
Or as you would say, perf.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.975
What a fun surprise
to see you both again.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.434
It's like every time

19:04.476 --> 19:06.979
I turn around,
there you are... IRL.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.772
Well, you better get used to it.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.400
Because I am going to build
my own stable of racehorses

19:11.441 --> 19:13.569
and support HHF
with the winnings.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.279
Starting with Leonora.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.905
Wait, I love that.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.283
Fallon Carrington:
Mother Teresa of Horse Girls.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.826
(sighs)
Hold on.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.661
I think I just saw the guy
passing the tuna tartare.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.663
Hey.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.832
Okay, we're alone now.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.542
Why are you really here?
I am not buying

19:28.584 --> 19:30.210
this whole
emotional connection act.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.628
It's not an act.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.297
Leonora just sparked
something in me.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.049
Well, you obviously heard
that I had my sights set on her.

19:37.050 --> 19:40.012
I will not let you
waltz back into my life

19:40.053 --> 19:41.346
and take what
isn't yours.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.182
You think I'm here
because of you?

19:43.223 --> 19:45.184
Yeah.
Has one of these horses

19:45.225 --> 19:46.977
kicked you in the head?
Because you're out of your mind.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.812
You're out of your league
if you think you're gonna win.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.732
See you on the auction floor,
bitch.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.734
(scoffs)
All right.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.986
I'll see you there.
I cannot wait

19:56.028 --> 19:58.363
to kick your ass
just like always.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.449
BT-dubs.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.706
He said we'll circle back
in a few months.

20:07.748 --> 20:08.749
We don't have that kind of time.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.167
You can't fool them forever.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.877
Actually, I'm starting
to think I can.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.212
The more time I spend
with Blake, the more I realize

20:13.253 --> 20:15.047
he only cares
about making money.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.757
That's great, but we still
need him to sign the documents.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.717
That's why we hit him
where he'll actually feel it.

20:18.759 --> 20:22.179
I'll show him Cristal's gonna
hurt the family's bottom line.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.680
You think that'll work?

20:23.722 --> 20:25.807
Trust me, I know this guy now.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.643
Fine, but don't push it
too hard.

20:27.684 --> 20:28.936
My sister's not a moron.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.729
We don't want
to make him suspicious.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.773
BLAKE: No, that's okay, I think
I left it up in the bedroom.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.816
I got to go.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.404
(clears throat)
No.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.698
I know it's my fault.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.992
I just never saw the emails.

20:44.034 --> 20:46.495
We'll make it up somehow.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.123
What was that all about?

20:50.165 --> 20:53.168
That was a member
of the Flores board.

20:53.210 --> 20:56.421
(sighs) I may have just caused
the company to lose millions.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.758
Millions?
Yeah, there was

20:59.800 --> 21:02.469
a ticking clock on a deal,
and I just never saw the emails

21:02.511 --> 21:05.555
and didn't okay it in time,
so they went with someone else.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.641
It was a stupid mistake.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.893
But an expensive one.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.272
I know Beto can be difficult,

21:13.313 --> 21:15.524
but the transfer
really might

21:15.565 --> 21:18.110
be better for all of us
in the long run.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.030
Honey, a company like Flores
can take a hit or two.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.157
You'll settle in soon enough.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.120
Yeah, no, no, no.
Nina just needs

21:28.161 --> 21:29.663
a few more days
to work through some things.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.291
Yeah, look, there-there's
no reason to panic.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.460
Yeah.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.254
Yeah, will do.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.173
(sighs)

21:40.215 --> 21:41.758
Sounds like
you're having

21:41.800 --> 21:43.677
a similarly awful start
to your day.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.429
At the risk
of making things worse,

21:45.470 --> 21:46.471
have you seen my brother?

21:46.513 --> 21:48.390
No, it hasn't been that bad.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.975
I just need
to find Adam to amend

21:50.017 --> 21:51.727
some ridiculous
Alexam requests.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.520
Well, if you stick around,
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.439
I mean,
the guy doesn't have much

21:55.480 --> 21:57.232
of a life outside
the hospital or this house.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.359
Two places that would probably
be better off without him.

21:59.401 --> 22:02.029
(laughs)
You know what,
as for sticking around,

22:02.070 --> 22:04.614
I'm realizing more and more
that waiting for someone

22:04.656 --> 22:06.992
to make things right is
just wasted energy.

22:07.034 --> 22:10.662
Especially when I could be
doing much more pleasant things.

22:10.704 --> 22:11.955
Thanks
for the reminder.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.582
Actually, thank you.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.006
MAN:
Jay's Flowers.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.841
Yeah, hi, I'd like to place
an order, please.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.926
What can I get you?
Whatever arrangement

22:24.968 --> 22:26.803
you have that smells
like an apology.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.347
Patty and I were never friends.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.515
Both of our families were
in oil, we crossed paths.

22:30.557 --> 22:33.185
And then I kicked her ass
all over the equestrian ring.

22:33.226 --> 22:34.811
And I guess she still
hasn't gotten over it.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.063
Oh, look.
Leonora is up.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.606
Ah, ooh!

22:37.647 --> 22:39.191
AUCTIONEER: Ladies and
gentlemen, we'll start

22:39.232 --> 22:41.693
the bidding for the lovely
Leonora at $100,000.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.904
Do I hear $100,000? 100,000

22:43.945 --> 22:45.280
to the back bidder.
Bidder, thank you so much.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.782
Looking for 200-- do I hear 200?

22:46.823 --> 22:48.367
200,000. Thank you so much.

22:48.408 --> 22:49.826
Do I hear 300,000?

22:49.868 --> 22:52.579
300,000 to Ms. de Vilbis.
Thank you so much.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.915
Got 300,000. Do I hear 400,000?

22:54.956 --> 22:57.167
400!
What? What are you doing?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.169
Oh, sorry, I just got
caught up in the excitement.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.338
Never mind.
I'll go for 600,000.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.340
600,000 right here, bidder,
bidder! Looking for seven.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.050
I've got 700,000!
Thank you so much.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.968
Do I hear 800,000?

23:07.010 --> 23:09.012
800,000, bidder, bidder!
Looking for nine.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.765
900,000...
Uh, one million.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.810
$1 million, bidder, bidder...
Wow, you sure do like
losing to me, don't you?

23:14.851 --> 23:16.978
No, not this time,
because your daddy isn't here

23:17.020 --> 23:19.064
to bribe the auctioneer like
he did the competition judges.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.942
One million-five.
$1.5 million...

23:21.983 --> 23:23.944
You mean like the
time your dad tried

23:23.985 --> 23:27.114
to pay me to let you win the
southeast regional? One-six.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.156
PATTY:
Uh, one-seven.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.282
FALLON: One-eight!
One-nine!

23:29.324 --> 23:31.326
Two million.
$2 million!

23:31.368 --> 23:33.453
Okay, let's remember why
you're here, you know?

23:33.495 --> 23:35.163
The good cause?
Your personal growth?

23:35.205 --> 23:36.957
Take it down a notch.

23:36.998 --> 23:38.834
We have Ms. Carrington
at $2 million!

23:38.875 --> 23:40.836
Do I hear 2.1?
BOTH: Two-one!

23:40.877 --> 23:42.546
What? No.
It was my turn.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.089
Well, you never
could keep up.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.466
And you could never shut up.
Three million!

23:46.508 --> 23:47.717
Three-one!

23:47.759 --> 23:49.052
(screams)

23:49.094 --> 23:50.387
(all gasping, murmuring)

23:50.429 --> 23:52.139
And done.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.474
Ladies, please! Hold on.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.685
While the foundation appreciates

23:56.726 --> 23:59.646
your enthusiasm
and certainly your generosity,

23:59.688 --> 24:03.275
we need to maintain decorum
and our schedule.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.277
So we'll finish this sale

24:05.318 --> 24:07.612
with a single sealed bid.

24:07.654 --> 24:10.907
All bids are due in ten minutes.
Good luck.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.868
Oh, she's scared.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.412
Now I just need to figure
out how high to bid

24:15.454 --> 24:16.663
and which champagne
to celebrate with.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.248
♪ My heart's forsaken me. ♪

24:18.290 --> 24:19.332
You look stunning.

24:19.374 --> 24:20.584
Is this the same outfit?

24:20.625 --> 24:21.960
It looks different.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.837
It's the same but better.
Trust me.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.297
Okay, the move is

24:25.338 --> 24:27.007
just like we discussed
last night.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.925
The only adjustment is,
you release

24:28.967 --> 24:31.344
the button, shift, and zip down.

24:31.386 --> 24:34.764
Uh... there was no,
there was no zipping before.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.725
You can't just
spring this on me.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.059
I need time to practice.

24:38.101 --> 24:41.188
Adversity in art creates magic.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.356
This isn't magic, it's a zipper.

24:43.398 --> 24:45.192
WOMAN:
Ms. Deveraux, one minute!

24:45.233 --> 24:47.235
Just take your time with it.

24:50.697 --> 24:52.491
Can you help her?

24:52.532 --> 24:54.159
Maybe give her
your "roll with it" pep talk?

24:54.201 --> 24:55.702
If she can't pull off

24:55.744 --> 24:57.996
this reveal, I am going
to look like an amateur.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.998
I'll try.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.334
I don't think she's gonna be
able to make it work, though.

25:03.293 --> 25:04.794
(Dominique groans)

25:04.836 --> 25:06.671
This is a disaster.

25:06.713 --> 25:08.256
Okay.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.967
Coach her to walk without
the transformation.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.512
Better to be safe
than embarrassed.

25:13.553 --> 25:17.098
ANNOUNCER:
And now the designer of our next
collection, Dominique Devereaux!

25:17.140 --> 25:19.267
(applause)

25:19.309 --> 25:21.186
(indistinct chatter)

25:21.228 --> 25:22.562
Hey, did you settle
on a number yet?

25:22.604 --> 25:24.147
Still working through it.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.815
If Patty's pockets are as deep
as her grudge,

25:25.857 --> 25:27.859
what makes you think
she won't bid 20 million?

25:27.901 --> 25:29.444
You're right.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.321
I should probably go in
for more than I thought.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.281
What? No, no, I was...
(laughs)

25:33.323 --> 25:35.867
I was making a point, which
you are clearly not getting.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.328
You can give
the same amount of money to HHF,

25:38.370 --> 25:39.829
walk away with ten horses,

25:39.871 --> 25:41.498
and avoid this petty pony show.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.084
Which is
why I have a suggestion.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.752
Hey.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.588
Fallon, meet Daniel.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.757
He's the cowboy that
suggested HHF to me.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.885
Not sure now's the time for me
to meet your new boyfriend, Sam.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.720
I'm a horse trainer.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.389
And Sam tells me
you're starting a stable.

25:57.430 --> 25:59.432
The truth is, Leonora's
pretty to look at,

25:59.474 --> 26:01.768
but there are other horses here
with more winning potential.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.646
Well, thank you for the hot tip,
Daniel, but as Sam

26:04.688 --> 26:07.399
keeps reminding me, I am here
for a much larger purpose.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.359
And that purpose
involves Leonora.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.319
Why aren't you supporting me
on this?

26:11.361 --> 26:15.073
Because you're just as bad
as Cruella de Vilbis over there.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.659
And I don't want you to wake up
one morning, back at work,

26:17.701 --> 26:19.369
and realize that you wasted
this chance

26:19.411 --> 26:21.413
on some stupid
childhood rivalry.

26:21.454 --> 26:24.749
Okay, well, all the money
will still be going to charity,

26:24.791 --> 26:26.668
so it still feeds
my feel-good fund.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.629
(scoffs)

26:29.671 --> 26:32.424
I am so sorry
to have wasted your time.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.176
I thought she was here because
she wanted to expand her life,

26:35.218 --> 26:36.720
but, um...

26:36.761 --> 26:38.555
I guess I was wrong.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.682
You know, I was so excited
when you came to me.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.768
I decided to help
because I actually believed

26:43.810 --> 26:47.397
you were interested in being
someone who's more fulfilled,

26:47.439 --> 26:49.858
more well-rounded,
but right now

26:49.899 --> 26:51.776
all you seem to care about
is beating someone.

26:51.818 --> 26:55.530
And you, well, you don't
need my help for that.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.657
So...

27:06.249 --> 27:08.752
Hey, there you are.
Thanks for coming, sweetheart.

27:08.793 --> 27:11.504
Of course. I wouldn't
miss your big moment.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.506
Wish I could miss it.
I had to nix

27:13.548 --> 27:15.425
the big transformation,
which basically

27:15.467 --> 27:17.052
kills any hope for the Plume.

27:17.093 --> 27:19.346
Wow, this is a...

27:19.387 --> 27:21.473
a whole new vibe
you got going on here.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.642
Maybe I'll just slip
out the back.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.185
Oh, come on,
I'm sure it'll be...

27:25.226 --> 27:26.686
Wait, what the hell?

27:26.728 --> 27:29.397
♪ I love who I see ♪

27:29.439 --> 27:32.192

27:32.233 --> 27:33.818
DOMINIQUE:
What is she doing?

27:33.860 --> 27:36.655
She said she didn't even
want to model anymore.

27:36.696 --> 27:38.490
(crowd clamoring)

27:38.531 --> 27:40.575
She's never practiced
the reveal.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.218
(laughs)
All right, forget divine.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.719
That is savage.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.600
♪ In the mirror. ♪

28:05.642 --> 28:07.477
As a reminder,

28:07.519 --> 28:09.771
bidding was paused
at $3.1 million.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.481
Ms. de Vilbis has bid

28:11.523 --> 28:14.150
an additional $1 million,
bringing

28:14.192 --> 28:17.153
the total to $4.1 million.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.781
A new HHF record.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.701
Ms. Carrington, in order to win,

28:22.742 --> 28:24.619
must bid a total of more

28:24.661 --> 28:27.622
than $4.1 million.

28:27.664 --> 28:30.250
Ms. Carrington bid...
one dollar?

28:31.626 --> 28:32.877
Is this some kind of joke?

28:32.919 --> 28:34.295
No joke, auction guy.

28:34.337 --> 28:36.005
Leonora is all hers

28:36.047 --> 28:38.758
for 4.1 million.
Now onto the next horse.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.260
I'm supposed to say that.

28:40.301 --> 28:42.053
Congrats, Patty.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.264
Aw, don't pout just because
you were too scared to bid.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.599
Believe it or not,
this wasn't about you

28:46.641 --> 28:49.394
or winning or competition.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.104
It was about doing something
new and good

28:51.146 --> 28:52.814
for not only myself
but for others.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.357
I just forgot that for a second.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.359
Yeah. I don't believe you.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.445
I'll totally get you tix
when Leonora races.

28:58.486 --> 29:00.029
Just call me whenevs.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.240
(laughs):
Oh, Patty.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.200
When I call you something,
it is gonna be

29:04.242 --> 29:06.202
so much worse than "whenevs."

29:06.244 --> 29:07.620
AUCTIONEER:
$100,000. We'll start
the bidding, therefore,

29:07.662 --> 29:10.039
at $100,000.
Do I hear...?

29:10.081 --> 29:12.041
Thank you again
for stopping by.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.793
I just needed
to work through some stuff,

29:13.835 --> 29:15.754
but sometimes
things correct themselves.

29:15.795 --> 29:19.257
I think we should do this...
if you're still interested.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.885
I will never tell.
It's called a secret ingredient

29:21.926 --> 29:23.845
for a reason.
Hey.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.890
What are you doing here?

29:26.931 --> 29:28.725
Well, I was dropping off
a birthday present for Mrs. G.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.477
Uh, it was great to see you.

29:30.518 --> 29:31.936
We're just kind of
in the middle of a thing here.

29:31.978 --> 29:35.273
Of course.
I will leave you two alone.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.650
Guys, just chill.
We're all good.

29:37.692 --> 29:38.985
Although next
time I'd prefer

29:39.027 --> 29:41.237
an apology bottle of gin
over flowers.

29:42.405 --> 29:43.698
I'm sorry. What?

29:43.740 --> 29:46.159
I'm kidding.
It was a nice gesture.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.077
And although I hate
to admit it, your apology note

29:48.119 --> 29:50.955
was impressive.
You have a way with words.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.710
And the lack of comprehension

29:55.752 --> 29:57.378
on your face
makes me think

29:57.420 --> 30:00.089
you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

30:02.842 --> 30:04.677
Let me explain.

30:04.719 --> 30:07.639
You sent her flowers in my name
and apologized?

30:07.680 --> 30:09.682
Guess I don't have to explain.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.935
I shouldn't have done it,
I know.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.478
I just panicked when I didn't
hear back from you.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.979
It was stupid.
Okay, for the record,

30:15.021 --> 30:16.439
I didn't call you back
because I was trying

30:16.481 --> 30:17.941
to make sure
the schedule worked.

30:17.982 --> 30:19.692
But now none of this works.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.152
No, no, no, please, the
producers were pressuring me.

30:21.194 --> 30:22.821
I felt
like I was out of options.

30:22.862 --> 30:24.823
And now you are.

30:24.864 --> 30:27.158
(stammers)

30:27.200 --> 30:28.910
I told you this had nothing
to do with me.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.954
What were you thinking?

30:32.705 --> 30:34.582
I guess
I hadn't realized how much

30:34.624 --> 30:36.793
I wanted this
until I saw it slipping away.

30:41.172 --> 30:43.508
And after consulting
with Amanda,

30:43.550 --> 30:45.635
I can't honor
all of your requests.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.262
I'm so sorry.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.472
Of course,
Amanda would agree with that.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.765
Seems fair to me considering

30:50.807 --> 30:51.724
what you put
your mother through.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.894
I'm sorry, who are you?

30:54.936 --> 30:57.939
Oh, hey. Dex Dexter.
I'm a friend of your mom's.

30:57.981 --> 31:00.108
That's a great, great name.

31:00.149 --> 31:01.860
Excuse me.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.987
(sighs) Well...

31:04.028 --> 31:05.780
that went well.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.408
Okay, just a few more stops
and then we'll be done.

31:08.449 --> 31:10.410
You like beauty
stores, right?

31:10.451 --> 31:13.079
(chuckles) Listen,
I've loved the last few days,

31:13.121 --> 31:15.957
but I got to ask...
what the hell is going on here?

31:15.999 --> 31:18.543
I know, I've dragged
you all over town.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.378
It's just insane.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.422
Alexis,
I feel like you're testing me,

31:22.463 --> 31:24.591
and I just don't know
what I need to do to pass.

31:24.632 --> 31:26.426
So I'm gonna go home.

31:26.467 --> 31:28.761
Unless you want
to tell me the truth.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.849
Fine.

31:36.436 --> 31:38.563
I'm...

31:38.605 --> 31:40.690
just a little
confused about this.

31:41.941 --> 31:44.110
Us.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.070
If it's not serious,

31:46.112 --> 31:47.822
and this is just a...

31:47.864 --> 31:49.490
bucket list thing for you,

31:49.532 --> 31:51.492
I'm flattered.

31:51.534 --> 31:54.037
And it's fine.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.747
But I need to know.

31:55.788 --> 31:57.540
(chuckles)

31:57.582 --> 31:59.626
This isn't a game for me.

31:59.667 --> 32:01.794
You really think
I like doing errands?

32:03.504 --> 32:05.590
This is real, Alexis.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.594
But fair is fair.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.304
And I have errands to run.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.097
And I'd like you to join me.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.683
Of course.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.311
Problem is... they're in Dubai.

32:18.353 --> 32:21.522
So...
if you're okay with it,

32:21.564 --> 32:22.982
we'll fly over there and stay

32:23.024 --> 32:24.692
at my family's house
for a few weeks.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.070
Ah, it's less
of a house

32:27.111 --> 32:29.238
and more of a castle, actually.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.157
Oh, really?

32:31.199 --> 32:33.159
Well, I-I think
I can handle that.

32:33.201 --> 32:35.411
It's a plan.

32:37.747 --> 32:40.249
Wait till you see
what's on the menu.

32:42.085 --> 32:45.213
Okay if we start with dessert?

32:45.254 --> 32:47.465
It's your special night.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.094
(winces)

32:51.135 --> 32:53.346
I'm sorry. I just need a minute.

32:53.388 --> 32:54.722
Well, what is it? What can I do?

32:54.764 --> 32:56.432
Nothing.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.768
I've just been so out of sorts.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.104
The shooting, the campaign,

33:01.145 --> 33:03.064
running Flores Inc.,

33:03.106 --> 33:04.774
I just...

33:04.816 --> 33:07.110
feel like it's crushing me.

33:07.151 --> 33:09.195
Ah.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.116
Honey, I had no idea
it was this hard for you.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.617
I should have listened
to you before.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.119
I'll call the lawyers
and I'll tell them

33:16.160 --> 33:17.745
to change the contract.

33:17.787 --> 33:19.872
Blake.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.127
Thank you.

33:24.168 --> 33:26.754
Nothing is worth
seeing you suffer.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.715
You mean too much to me.

33:36.806 --> 33:39.017
Thank you for your support.
I couldn't have done it

33:39.058 --> 33:40.685
without you,
and even though I didn't win...

33:40.727 --> 33:42.353
You were robbed.
Completely.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.397
Yes, I know, but the point is,

33:44.439 --> 33:46.274
even though I didn't win,

33:46.315 --> 33:48.776
I am damn proud of my designs.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.278
Cheers.

33:50.319 --> 33:51.279
(chuckles)

33:52.155 --> 33:53.406
It's ginger ale.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.074
DOMINIQUE:
And I'm hoping we can

33:55.116 --> 33:56.659
do this again in the future,
if you're interested.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.037
I know this probably
wasn't easy for you.

33:59.078 --> 34:01.122
Yeah, it wasn't easy,

34:01.164 --> 34:03.541
but your fierce attitude,
in the face of all the setbacks,

34:03.583 --> 34:05.752
really inspired me.
I couldn't let you down.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.587
I'm glad
because I was panicked.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.672
Hey, you were both impressive.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.924
I realized
just how much I missed this.

34:11.966 --> 34:13.885
Modeling wasn't the reason
for all my problems.

34:13.926 --> 34:17.013
It was just the bad choices
I made when I was doing it.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.765
Well, I'm excited
to see what's next for you.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.141
And, Mom,

34:20.183 --> 34:23.227
you turned
some serious heads today.

34:23.269 --> 34:25.021
Randall was gushing

34:25.063 --> 34:26.731
about your looks.
There'll be more chances

34:26.773 --> 34:28.775
to baby-step
into the high-end fashion club.

34:28.816 --> 34:31.527
You're right-- just like you
were right about NordicStar.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.571
But I'm done taking baby steps

34:33.613 --> 34:35.740
and hoping they let me
in their club.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.950
Dominique Deveraux doesn't ask
for permission.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.535
So NordicStar is back in play?

34:39.577 --> 34:41.120
Oh, it's not only back in play.

34:41.162 --> 34:42.914
It's the play.

34:42.955 --> 34:45.083
That's what I like to hear.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.837
You know you have
to return that, right?

34:49.879 --> 34:51.380
Yeah, I know.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.299
Just not yet.

34:54.383 --> 34:56.427
Don't forget
to count this.

34:56.469 --> 34:59.055
Obviously it's for you,
not the club.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.349
Just seemed
like a good way in.

35:01.390 --> 35:03.142
(sets bottle down)

35:03.184 --> 35:05.770
Look, it's my real apology
for the fake flowers

35:05.812 --> 35:08.189
and for involving you
in my drama.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.858
Well, I appreciate
the gesture.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.361
Although I do
actually like flowers.

35:13.402 --> 35:15.196
(laughs)
Noted.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.031
All right, look,
I should've been more

35:17.073 --> 35:18.950
up front with you, it's just...

35:18.991 --> 35:21.619
I don't know, it wasn't
my first instinct to share

35:21.661 --> 35:23.246
my insecurities
with my wife's ex-boyfriend

35:23.287 --> 35:24.705
who has his whole life together.

35:24.747 --> 35:26.707
Oh, trust me,
there are many things

35:26.749 --> 35:28.543
in my life
that are not together.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.586
It's just difficult
to watch Fallon sometimes,

35:30.628 --> 35:32.171
who's always fired up
about something,

35:32.213 --> 35:33.631
when I got
nothing exciting.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.091
Well, if there's anyone
who understands

35:35.133 --> 35:36.467
where you're coming from,
it's me.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.011
But that whole
fake apology thing?

35:39.053 --> 35:40.680
Please do not try that
on Nina again.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.685
Wait, again?
Why would I need to...?

35:45.726 --> 35:47.645
'Cause...

35:47.687 --> 35:49.605
I convinced Nina
to give you a second chance.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.066
But it took a little
bartering. She mentioned

35:52.108 --> 35:53.401
her hectic schedule,
so I offered

35:53.442 --> 35:55.153
the hotel
as an additional location

35:55.194 --> 35:57.780
for more flexibility.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.532
She'll be contacting
your producers tonight.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.659
I don't know what to say, man.

36:01.701 --> 36:04.120
Just promise me you'll leave
the emotional espionage

36:04.162 --> 36:07.165
to your wife because you are
really not good at that.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.125
Thank you.
I owe you big-time, all right?

36:09.167 --> 36:11.252
I promise you won't
regret this.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.296
Well, if Nina's gonna be around,

36:13.337 --> 36:15.214
I bet I will.

36:17.049 --> 36:18.926
I saw Patty's
Insta-gloat.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.511
Your final bid
was a dollar?

36:20.553 --> 36:22.430
Well, I took your advice
and I walked away.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.223
I probably should have
listened to you sooner,

36:24.265 --> 36:26.934
but, you know, sometimes
I can be a little stubborn.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.394
No.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.396
But I feel like
I did walk away with some wins.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.316
I mean, the foundation raised
a record amount of money.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.984
And I revived
my love for horses.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.986
All right, but maybe,
with whatever's next,

36:37.028 --> 36:38.696
don't put
so much pressure on yourself

36:38.738 --> 36:39.989
to make it happen overnight.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.157
All right?

36:41.199 --> 36:42.575
What's the hurry?

36:42.617 --> 36:45.161
I have had
more near-death experiences

36:45.203 --> 36:47.705
than the average
20-something-year-old.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.874
I mean, what if I don't have
that much time left?

36:49.916 --> 36:51.876
That's why you're concerned?

36:51.918 --> 36:54.295
I'm pretty sure nothing
can kill you at this point.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.422
No, strangely, it's not
so much about the dying.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.758
It's about what happens after.

36:58.799 --> 37:01.552
When everyone thought
I was dead, the only words

37:01.594 --> 37:04.305
used to describe me
in my obituaries were "CEO,

37:04.347 --> 37:06.057
"oil heiress,

37:06.098 --> 37:07.934
beautiful." I mean, all true.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.602
But...
(chuckles)

37:09.644 --> 37:11.187
not exactly anything
to be proud of.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.105
You know you're more than that.

37:13.147 --> 37:15.149
Yeah, but no one else
seems to know.

37:15.191 --> 37:17.193
And the truth is, if I die,

37:17.235 --> 37:19.528
I'm not leaving the world
much better than I found it.

37:19.570 --> 37:20.863
So what are you gonna do?

37:20.905 --> 37:22.365
I need to be better.

37:22.406 --> 37:23.866
Big things are coming, Sam.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.785
And the horses?

37:25.826 --> 37:28.329
Oh, I'm absolutely
still starting a stable.

37:28.371 --> 37:31.165
In fact, I just bid on a horse
that Daniel suggested--

37:31.207 --> 37:34.001
Allegra. He offered to train
her for me so I could beat

37:34.043 --> 37:35.836
the hell out of Patty
on the racetrack.

37:37.672 --> 37:40.007
Oh, what? I'm not
actually Mother Teresa.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.474
Beto, wait. What are you doing?

37:48.516 --> 37:50.393
Despite what you think,

37:50.434 --> 37:52.061
I'm not a bad person.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.647
Yeah, just a greedy one.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.274
(scoffs)

37:56.315 --> 37:58.276
Why let me free now?

37:58.317 --> 38:00.569
Oh, you're not going anywhere.
I just needed to clear the room

38:00.611 --> 38:02.405
of anything dangerous
before I untied you.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.198
I wouldn't want you
to hurt yourself.

38:06.909 --> 38:08.452
(chuckles)
I already told you.

38:08.494 --> 38:10.037
You can't break
those glass doors.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.372
And even if you could,
you're not gonna bust

38:11.414 --> 38:13.207
through the
bars anyway.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.459
Just accept this is gonna
be your home for now.

38:15.501 --> 38:17.253
As long as you're
calm, you can keep

38:17.295 --> 38:18.629
your hands free and
stretch out your legs.

38:18.671 --> 38:19.964
(door opens)

38:20.006 --> 38:21.757
¿Me entendiste?

38:21.799 --> 38:24.260
RITA:
Blake agreed
to sign away the company.

38:24.302 --> 38:27.013
The transfer documents will
be ready in a few days.

38:27.054 --> 38:29.056
BETO (sighs):
We are one signature away

38:29.098 --> 38:30.599
from getting everything we want.

38:30.641 --> 38:33.686
(chuckles)
It's amazing what some lingerie

38:33.728 --> 38:35.688
can do to change a man's mind.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.356
You're a liar.

38:37.398 --> 38:40.443
You know Blake isn't one
to be talked out of something

38:40.484 --> 38:42.570
without getting something
in return.

38:42.611 --> 38:44.989
How do you think
this will play out?

38:45.031 --> 38:46.741
Once I tell the truth,

38:46.782 --> 38:48.284
the courts will reverse
the transfer.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.995
Once I'm in Mexico,
I'm untouchable.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.956
And I'll just be some
hallucination your foggy mind

38:53.998 --> 38:55.541
conjured up.
Do you really think

38:55.583 --> 38:57.335
anyone is gonna believe
your double delusion?

38:57.376 --> 38:59.211
Especially
after that brain tumor.

39:01.213 --> 39:04.967
Remember, behave yourself and
all this will be over soon.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.765
I find it poetic
that Blake's love for his wife

39:10.806 --> 39:13.434
is the reason
he's so easy to fool.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.394
His loyalty is hot.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.355
I'm really growing fond

39:17.396 --> 39:19.607
of the Carrington lifestyle
and Blake.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.734
Enjoy it while you can.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.527
Because it won't last.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.781
You won't get away
with this.

39:26.822 --> 39:28.741
I don't want to get away.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.659
That's the point.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.662
Who wants to disappear
with a paycheck from Beto

39:33.704 --> 39:35.831
when I could live
like a queen in Atlanta?

39:37.666 --> 39:39.543
All I need to do

39:39.585 --> 39:42.213
is erase you.

39:43.130 --> 39:46.133
("Tilikum" by Benjamin
Francis Leftwich playing)

39:50.846 --> 39:52.681
So the movie is a go.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.517
I mean, I still have
to write a screenplay.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.727
And you didn't think it
was a real opportunity.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.646
(laughs) I don't know.

39:58.687 --> 40:00.648
I think I was just afraid
I'd jinx it.

40:00.689 --> 40:02.316
But now that it's
finally happening,

40:02.358 --> 40:03.943
I have to admit
that it feels good.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.945
So what happened
with the auction?

40:05.986 --> 40:08.114
Well, I lost the horse.

40:08.155 --> 40:11.450
But I ended up with something
much better in the end.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.119
I'm gonna change the world.

40:13.160 --> 40:16.205
Wow, sounds like
an exciting auction.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.624
Let's just say
Patty held up a mirror,

40:18.666 --> 40:20.376
and I didn't like what I saw.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.877
And it's up to me
to change that.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.630
Well, I am impressed.
It's a lofty goal.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.924
But for the record,
I love looking at you.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.968
Mirror or no mirror.

40:29.009 --> 40:31.679
It's nice that it finally
feels like our futures

40:31.720 --> 40:33.347
are coming into focus.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.766
Now that we've basically figured
out the rest of our lives,

40:35.808 --> 40:38.269
we can celebrate.

40:38.310 --> 40:42.273
♪ Tonight you're flying
out of hell ♪

40:43.190 --> 40:44.984
♪ Be my rose... ♪

40:45.025 --> 40:46.652
Whoa.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.821
Where did you go?
I'm sorry.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.490
You just, you reminded me
of one more thing.

40:51.532 --> 40:54.076
Yesterday...

40:54.118 --> 40:56.912
when you woke me up,
I actually was dreaming.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.914
And I have
been dreaming

40:58.956 --> 41:00.749
almost every night
since my coma...

41:00.791 --> 41:03.002
about our future.

41:04.336 --> 41:05.880
Are you worried about us?

41:05.921 --> 41:07.089
Not at all.

41:08.674 --> 41:10.676
It's just that every time,

41:10.718 --> 41:13.220
it's me, you...

41:13.262 --> 41:15.806
and our children.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.766
And I just didn't
mention it

41:17.808 --> 41:20.603
because...
I wasn't sure how I felt

41:20.644 --> 41:21.937
about it.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.355
And now?

41:23.397 --> 41:26.233
Well, and now I'm thinking...

41:26.275 --> 41:29.361
if I'm going to leave
the world a better place...

41:29.403 --> 41:32.114
shouldn't we have
an adorable family to run it?

41:34.074 --> 41:36.410
I know the last time that
we talked about kids,

41:36.452 --> 41:37.578
you were hesitant.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.955
So...

41:39.997 --> 41:42.041
when you're ready to talk,

41:42.082 --> 41:44.960
I would love to reopen
that conversation.

41:46.587 --> 41:47.963
I think, um...

41:50.466 --> 41:52.510
I just need some time to think.
