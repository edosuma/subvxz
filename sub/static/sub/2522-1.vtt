[POURING LIQUID]

00:39.265 --> 00:40.557
And honestly...

00:40.558 --> 00:42.225
I wake up happy.

00:42.226 --> 00:44.561
I mean, I'm that guy.

00:44.562 --> 00:46.729
I've got enough of everything I need.

00:46.730 --> 00:49.065
I'm single, I like a party,

00:49.066 --> 00:50.733
and I'm old enough to enjoy it.

00:50.734 --> 00:52.527
Young enough to enjoy it.

00:52.528 --> 00:56.739
I want to do something, and I do it.

00:56.740 --> 00:58.658
[WAITER] There seems to
be a little problem.

00:58.659 --> 01:02.745
Oh. Must be the magnetic stripe.

01:02.746 --> 01:04.747
And the weird thing is

01:04.748 --> 01:06.249
I know it's all a clichÃ©.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.084
No strings, no obligations,

01:08.085 --> 01:09.669
but what's the alternative?

01:09.670 --> 01:13.423
Get into some life, wife, kids,

01:13.424 --> 01:16.259
some kind of car with too many seats?

01:16.260 --> 01:18.261
That's a world where you
have to do whatever it is

01:18.262 --> 01:20.847
other people want you
to do to keep it going.

01:20.848 --> 01:24.142
It's prostitution
when you think about it.

01:24.143 --> 01:27.687
But there is a nagging feeling
that I'm missing something.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.772
Sorry, I don't know
what the problem is.

01:29.773 --> 01:31.316
No, it's not your fault.

01:31.317 --> 01:33.151
That should do it.

01:33.152 --> 01:35.069
And maybe in the end,
I'm worrying for nothing.

01:35.070 --> 01:36.863
I mean, I'm not at
this stage of my life

01:36.864 --> 01:39.449
where I have to worry
about most of this stuff.

01:39.450 --> 01:41.247
Maybe I never will.

01:43.829 --> 01:46.539
I must sound pretty selfish.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.041
Or just drunk.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.542
This is no good either.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.252
You're kidding.

01:51.253 --> 01:52.962
Are you serious?

01:52.963 --> 01:54.547
Whoa. Come on, wait.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.132
You know I have money.

01:56.133 --> 01:57.800
I just don't have any on me...

01:57.801 --> 01:59.469
or on my credit cards,

01:59.470 --> 02:01.221
but I get paid all the time,
and a lot.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.097
Maybe next time.

02:03.098 --> 02:05.396
Car fare?

02:12.942 --> 02:14.734
And by the way...

02:14.735 --> 02:16.986
as someone whose life
really is prostitution,

02:16.987 --> 02:20.823
I can tell you that until you're
actually fucking for a living,

02:20.824 --> 02:22.492
you shouldn't be complaining.

02:22.493 --> 02:24.244
Wait a minute.
That's not what I meant.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.246
Thanks for the drink.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.920
Call Beverly if you want
to make it up to me.

02:30.584 --> 02:34.258
[PHONE BUZZING]

02:47.434 --> 02:49.936
Good evening.

03:21.343 --> 03:23.845
Oh, shit.

03:41.613 --> 03:44.036

03:49.371 --> 03:51.122

You have the right to remain silent.

03:51.123 --> 03:52.749
Oh, wait. Stop.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.042
Ow!

03:54.043 --> 03:55.418
[MAN] Don't test me!

03:55.419 --> 03:56.836

03:56.837 --> 03:58.087

Stop! Relax!

04:03.385 --> 04:05.057
It's me!

04:06.513 --> 04:08.598
Jesus!

04:08.599 --> 04:11.768
What is wrong with you?

04:11.769 --> 04:12.852
I heard a noise.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.604
Ah...

04:14.605 --> 04:16.105
Turn right... I heard a noise.

04:16.106 --> 04:17.607
Everything is cool.

04:17.608 --> 04:19.024
There's nobody there.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.244
I swear.

Five-four-three-two-one-zero.

04:36.502 --> 04:39.721
Ignition. Lift-off.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.539
I guess that's really what I've
been trying to write about.

05:56.540 --> 05:58.958
I mean, who are we trying to fool?

05:58.959 --> 06:01.961
We're not only animals,
we're the worst animals there are.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.838
Why do we eat meat?

06:03.839 --> 06:06.048
The Greek gods dined
on ambrosia and nectar,

06:06.049 --> 06:08.050
but we need to incorporate
other species into us.

06:08.051 --> 06:09.802
Look at Christianity.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.221
"This is my body. This is my blood."

06:12.222 --> 06:16.225
That's why I'm doing this chapter
about the genocide in Rwanda.

06:16.226 --> 06:18.060
The Tutsis were vegetarians,

06:18.061 --> 06:20.229
and the Hutus were ranchers,
who eat meat,

06:20.230 --> 06:23.316
and they regarded the Tutsis
as monkeys, as animals,

06:23.317 --> 06:26.027
and that's why they had no trouble
killing them. Don't you think?

06:26.028 --> 06:27.737
Honestly, Ben, I don't know why

06:27.738 --> 06:29.572
the farmer and the cowhand
can't be friends.

06:29.573 --> 06:32.033
But I do know that part of the reason

06:32.034 --> 06:35.036
why some people regard
other people as animals

06:35.037 --> 06:37.413
is because they don't observe
the social conventions

06:37.414 --> 06:39.415
most of us take for granted.

06:39.416 --> 06:42.418
Every human function
is disgusting in our society.

06:42.419 --> 06:45.505
I side with the public on this one.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.715
I know what I am...

06:47.716 --> 06:49.884
and that's an animal.

06:49.885 --> 06:52.261
I'm human, but animal.

06:52.262 --> 06:54.430
You're wasting a lot of
thought on something

06:54.431 --> 06:56.349
that's not going
to get you high or laid.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.643
I always say, "If it ain't
broke, don't fix it."

06:58.644 --> 07:00.228
Well, you're very wise.

07:00.229 --> 07:02.688
And broke.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.690
That is so uncool.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.275
Can't I just take some money back?

07:06.276 --> 07:07.944
I get paid very soon, and when I do,

07:07.945 --> 07:09.862
I'm going to float you another loan.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.457
Until then, I'd like to
borrow back what I lent you.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.119
Why do you need to leave?

07:17.120 --> 07:19.580
You just going to go out there
and be part of the machine?

07:19.581 --> 07:24.086
Hey, that machine is what
keeps you in all this.

07:25.420 --> 07:27.588
Now you know there's no one
out there today, right?

07:27.589 --> 07:29.549
Yeah.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.468
So just hold it together
and do whatever it is you do.

07:32.469 --> 07:34.262
I'm writing a book.

07:34.263 --> 07:35.980
What is it that you do?

07:44.273 --> 07:46.616
Fuck it. I'm going to
get the didgeridoo.

07:48.777 --> 07:51.405
Please, didgeri-don't.

08:21.310 --> 08:23.519

08:48.629 --> 08:50.796
Pretty much the usual.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.548
There's this pocket
of cold air coming in,

08:52.549 --> 08:54.675
but you'll see it on the composite.

08:54.676 --> 08:56.844
I'm going to talk to Dave about
putting a real window in here

08:56.845 --> 08:58.304
so we can see if any
of this stuff is right.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.390
- It's right.
- Want one?

09:01.391 --> 09:02.683
They're poison.

09:37.427 --> 09:39.095

09:39.096 --> 09:40.596
You said it wasn't a big deal.

09:40.597 --> 09:42.390
I say a lot of things,

09:42.391 --> 09:44.600
like did I mention Steve,
glad you could make it?

09:44.601 --> 09:46.644
Can I get some water?

09:46.645 --> 09:48.854

And now, Victoria Riolobos

10:18.552 --> 10:19.593
with the news.

10:19.594 --> 10:21.345
Good afternoon.

10:21.346 --> 10:23.472
Tragedy struck this morning
as a Truxton man

10:23.473 --> 10:25.474
backed his late-model SUV

10:25.475 --> 10:27.268
into a daycare center.

10:27.269 --> 10:29.311
One youngster remains
in critical condition

10:29.312 --> 10:31.480
after being struck
by shrapnel-like debris

10:31.481 --> 10:33.315
during the collision, but luckily,

10:33.316 --> 10:35.317
the rest emerged scathed only by...

10:35.318 --> 10:37.445
Do you think the graphic
is in bad taste?

10:37.446 --> 10:38.988

10:47.247 --> 10:49.290
You know, Stu?

10:49.291 --> 10:51.667
You don't just go spreading
rumors about people like that.

10:51.668 --> 10:53.294
The man is a working professional.

10:53.295 --> 10:55.629
Lots of people have squinty red eyes,

10:55.630 --> 10:57.673
insatiable thirst,
and trouble walking.

10:57.674 --> 11:00.134
He could be diabetic or something.

11:00.135 --> 11:02.261
You're right. I'm sorry.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.804
The bearded and bespectacled doctor

11:03.805 --> 11:05.765

11:05.766 --> 11:09.685
making him one of the
world's most prolific killers.

11:09.686 --> 11:11.771
So Steve, how's it
looking out there today?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.814
It's about time we saw
some of this warmer weather.

11:13.815 --> 11:16.692
Well, Victoria,
let's get things started

11:16.693 --> 11:18.819
with a little shot of the harbor

11:18.820 --> 11:21.530
and some seagulls
enjoying the sunshine.

11:21.531 --> 11:23.324
How you doing there, fellas?

11:23.325 --> 11:26.035
Today's high will get up
to about 65 degrees

11:26.036 --> 11:28.162
with unlimited visibility

11:28.163 --> 11:30.623
which means if we could get this
Knucklehead out of the way,

11:30.624 --> 11:33.667
you could see clear
down to Ocean City.

11:33.668 --> 11:35.503
Coldest spot in the nation?

11:35.504 --> 11:37.671
Why, that honor goes to...

11:38.924 --> 11:40.966
Smooth as silk.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.177

like someone on drugs?

...and at 100% humidity
and 89 degrees

11:47.140 --> 11:49.558
little Hilo, Hawaii
is both the hottest

11:49.559 --> 11:51.393
and wettest spot in the nation.

11:51.394 --> 11:53.896
I guess that makes it
the number one destination

11:53.897 --> 11:56.525
for teenage boys, eh, Victoria?

12:00.695 --> 12:03.697
I guess so, Steve.

12:03.698 --> 12:05.533
So I know I don't have to tell you

12:05.534 --> 12:07.493
that showing up with
enough time for us to know

12:07.494 --> 12:09.912
that you're going to be here,
and in condition to work

12:09.913 --> 12:11.580
is 90 percent of it.

12:11.581 --> 12:13.582
And why the fuck
are you paying attention

12:13.583 --> 12:15.084
to your computer?

12:15.085 --> 12:16.669
Are you ever going to friend me?

12:16.670 --> 12:18.712
You think you're irreplaceable?

12:18.713 --> 12:20.714
You have this job because you're
handsome and you can talk.

12:20.715 --> 12:21.841
And people trust me.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.843
No one trusts you.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.803
You think you're going to move
to a bigger market?

12:25.804 --> 12:27.638
Not with that nose.

12:27.639 --> 12:29.932
You know, I could just
as easily demean your job

12:29.933 --> 12:31.767
if I had any idea what it entailed,

12:31.768 --> 12:34.270
and honestly, I kind of resent you

12:34.271 --> 12:36.522
making this so awkward for me.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.440

12:38.441 --> 12:40.526
Well, I need a little money

12:40.527 --> 12:42.069
It's the sixth.

12:42.070 --> 12:43.445
Look, I didn't say give it to me.

12:43.446 --> 12:45.030
It's just an advance.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.699
You know what the good thing is?

I know you can't go on
like this forever.

out here now, fuckers."

29:15.187 --> 29:16.437
And they'll do it.

29:16.438 --> 29:18.231
I'm not hungry.

29:18.232 --> 29:20.525
It hurts my head,
all these facts and figures.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.902
What are you talking about? You're
four credits shy of being an MBA.

29:22.903 --> 29:24.779
I'm not a businessman.
I hate businessmen.

29:24.780 --> 29:26.739
If Jerry Garcia hadn't lured you away

29:26.740 --> 29:28.700
you would have been
a great businessman.

29:28.701 --> 29:30.785
Who knew there was so much
money in a country store?

29:30.786 --> 29:32.787
I don't want money.

29:32.788 --> 29:34.956
You don't have to put such a
shitty spin on everything.

29:34.957 --> 29:37.250
Maybe this is your
father's way of giving you

29:37.251 --> 29:39.419
a chance to be what you
always wanted to be.

29:39.420 --> 29:42.130
This is my father reaching from
beyond the grave to control me.

29:42.131 --> 29:44.132
The whole thing just insinuates
that I'm crazy,

29:44.133 --> 29:46.092
that there's something wrong
with the way that I live,

29:46.093 --> 29:47.886
but I'm fine. Everything's fine.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.804
I'm supporting you.
Of course everything's fine.

29:49.805 --> 29:52.932
Look, I'm the last person
that should be saying this,

29:52.933 --> 29:55.026
but what about me?

30:00.649 --> 30:02.650
How's that?

30:02.651 --> 30:04.903
- What's the difference?
- I don't like hurting you.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.780
Well, I don't like that making a
baby feels like chemotherapy.

30:07.781 --> 30:10.450
Look, honey, your dad just died.

30:10.451 --> 30:12.160
And I'm shooting you
full of hormones.

30:12.161 --> 30:14.083
If that doesn't make you crazy...

30:15.581 --> 30:17.879
Are we going to do this?

30:20.502 --> 30:22.253
You still look beautiful.

30:22.254 --> 30:25.098
Thank you.

30:28.218 --> 30:29.510
Sorry!

30:29.511 --> 30:31.554
I'll be out in a minute.

30:31.555 --> 30:33.181
So you're really leaving?

30:33.182 --> 30:35.141
What are you going to do now?

30:35.142 --> 30:37.310
Some friends of mine have a farm
in upstate New York.

30:37.311 --> 30:40.188
Maybe I'll go hang out
with them for a while.

30:40.189 --> 30:44.609
Just growing incense
and making your own clothes?

30:44.610 --> 30:46.282
Not that you need any.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.491
No, actually, I have a degree.

30:51.492 --> 30:53.451
I'll probably go back
to teaching special ed.

30:53.452 --> 30:57.422
You got to look out for
Number One, I guess.

31:00.793 --> 31:03.336
You are so lovely.

31:03.337 --> 31:05.797
What's your point?

31:05.798 --> 31:08.216
It's just I knew the first Mrs. Baker

31:08.217 --> 31:11.219
and she wasn't even
remotely in your league.

31:11.220 --> 31:13.347
I mean, ever.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.890
Are you stoned?

31:15.891 --> 31:17.558
Sure, I'm the weird one.

31:17.559 --> 31:20.228
You had sex with a 900-year-old man.

31:20.229 --> 31:22.897
That barrel chest, those toenails.

31:22.898 --> 31:25.692
It probably sounds like a big joke,

31:25.693 --> 31:28.486
since that's what love always
sounds like to people like you,

31:28.487 --> 31:31.197
But Sam took pleasure
in everything in his life

31:31.198 --> 31:34.575
that was real, his food, his farm,

31:34.576 --> 31:38.830
his business, and yes, his wife.

31:38.831 --> 31:41.874
So when you were a little girl and
you imagined being with somebody,

31:41.875 --> 31:43.751
that was it?

31:43.752 --> 31:45.469
I can't believe you.

31:47.381 --> 31:49.340
Sam needed me.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.592
And he deserved me because
he was wonderful to me.

31:51.593 --> 31:53.720
You forget you're talking
about someone I knew

31:53.721 --> 31:55.430
longer than you actually.

31:55.431 --> 31:56.764
He stopped talking to his son.

31:56.765 --> 31:58.433
Ben stopped talking to him...

31:58.434 --> 32:00.311
and it broke his heart.

32:02.062 --> 32:05.273
Okay, well, maybe you'd better
run along and get high,

32:05.274 --> 32:06.607
so at least one of us can forget

32:06.608 --> 32:08.985
we had this conversation.

32:22.875 --> 32:27.846
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS]

32:53.530 --> 32:55.873
[BANG]

33:04.875 --> 33:06.793
[WOMAN]
Honey, what are you doing out there?

33:06.794 --> 33:08.669
Just trying to keep these
toys from killing the lawn.

33:08.670 --> 33:10.137
I'll be up in a minute.

33:11.965 --> 33:15.059
[WOMAN]
Is something burning? I smell smoke.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.987
- Morning.
- Morning.

33:34.988 --> 33:36.948
I could make you
some eggs if you want.

33:36.949 --> 33:39.158
Wait, now, are they the kind
with blood spots in them?

33:39.159 --> 33:41.160
They're eggs from chickens
who walk around.

33:41.161 --> 33:42.870
So they do have blood spots in them.

33:42.871 --> 33:45.123
Okay, everybody,
are you sitting down?

33:45.124 --> 33:47.208
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit.

33:47.209 --> 33:49.293
I had a... sit!

33:49.294 --> 33:50.962
I had an incredible night.

33:50.963 --> 33:53.047
And I swear to God
it was a visitation,

33:53.048 --> 33:54.966
and Dallas, I can't thank you enough.

33:54.967 --> 33:56.384
Are you okay?

33:56.385 --> 33:57.468
I am beyond okay.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.137
I'm past okay.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.888
I'm not even looking back
at it anymore.

34:00.889 --> 34:02.723
Steve was right. This is my chance.

34:02.724 --> 34:04.475
Of course I can't do it alone,
but I was thinking

34:04.476 --> 34:06.435
about taking the money
from the grocery store

34:06.436 --> 34:08.521
and creating an institute
where people can come and study

34:08.522 --> 34:10.523
how to regain man's balance
with nature.

34:10.524 --> 34:13.067
Horticulture, agriculture,
aquaculture.

34:13.068 --> 34:15.194
Angela, you know
about all of this shit,

34:15.195 --> 34:17.237
and you can give lessons on
cleaning and all that woman stuff,

34:17.239 --> 34:18.989
and Steve, if we're going
to have a society,

34:18.991 --> 34:20.491
we're going to need a TV station.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.743
You could have the whole station.

34:22.744 --> 34:24.291
That sounds great.

34:25.706 --> 34:27.998
You look like you haven't slept much.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.750
Why don't you sit down and
we'll have some breakfast

34:29.751 --> 34:31.918
and talk about the plan.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.589
You understand I'm talking about
fundamental changes to society.

34:34.590 --> 34:36.132
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm not hungry.

34:36.132 --> 34:37.885
I have a mission statement to write.

34:42.514 --> 34:45.224
Is it... always like that?

34:45.225 --> 34:47.435
He usually doesn't make
that much sense.

34:47.436 --> 34:49.152
I'll be right back.

34:52.024 --> 34:53.774
Hey, genius at work.

34:53.775 --> 34:56.444
I'm modeling it
on Plato's School of Athens

34:56.445 --> 34:59.697
only not the Socratic method.
It's more like Buddha.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.074
You can relax. I can see what's
going on in your face right now.

35:02.075 --> 35:04.202
It's one tenth of what's
going on in my mind.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.245
You told me that my father
had a plan for me,

35:06.246 --> 35:07.955
to do what I wanted,
and this is what I want,

35:07.956 --> 35:09.916
and I'm not leaving you behind.

35:09.917 --> 35:11.834
The TV station thing was
just off the top of my head.

35:11.835 --> 35:13.419
I want you to know that I'm grateful,

35:13.420 --> 35:15.213
and the way that I figure it,

35:15.214 --> 35:17.256
there's enough for me
to keep the grocery store,

35:17.257 --> 35:18.633
and for you to have the farm

35:18.634 --> 35:19.800
and the house.

35:19.801 --> 35:21.427
And it's not a gift.

35:21.428 --> 35:23.054
You've earned it.

35:23.055 --> 35:25.139
Suddenly the plan seems
more appealing.

35:25.140 --> 35:27.808
But I don't think you're...
you seem a little...

35:27.809 --> 35:29.477
The journey to enlightenment
is stressful.

35:29.478 --> 35:32.572
No, it's not enlightened.

35:33.774 --> 35:36.072
Great, Mom's home.

35:42.115 --> 35:44.116
Why are you still here?

35:44.117 --> 35:46.039
Why are you so angry?

35:47.496 --> 35:49.589
This was my mother's.

35:51.667 --> 35:53.125
I need you to mellow out.

35:53.126 --> 35:55.294
I need to keep my wits about me.

35:55.295 --> 35:57.463
- I'm going to get this all down.
- Please, you're out of control.

35:57.464 --> 36:00.174
- Let's take the edge off.
- Great...

36:00.175 --> 36:03.803
- This is my wedding all over again.
- What are you doing?

36:03.804 --> 36:06.180
This is important shit. This is
a chance to right your life.

36:06.181 --> 36:07.598
Drugs are not the answer.

36:07.599 --> 36:08.933
That's what I've been saying.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.893
Thank God you're here,
cuz I can't do it all alone.

36:10.894 --> 36:12.853
Jesus, get out and go away.
I need to talk to my brother.

36:12.854 --> 36:15.022
- He doesn't want to talk.
- Yes I do. I have a plan.

36:15.023 --> 36:16.983
- I'm going to start...
- You don't have to tell her your plan.

36:16.984 --> 36:19.026
Steve, I would prefer
to forgo your input

36:19.027 --> 36:21.988
and that most recently resulted
in my brother becoming fat,

36:21.989 --> 36:25.199
unemployed, and growing
that superbly antisocial beard.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.327
- Do not talk to him like that.
- No, it's okay.

36:28.328 --> 36:30.371
You know what, Terri? I am
going to get out of your way,

36:30.372 --> 36:32.540
you can direct that rage
where it really belongs,

36:32.541 --> 36:34.418
at your grieving family.

36:40.465 --> 36:42.842
He doesn't understand
what's going on.

36:42.843 --> 36:44.343
The decisions that you make now

36:44.344 --> 36:46.053
could secure a real future.

36:46.054 --> 36:48.014
You don't think I know that?

36:48.015 --> 36:50.308
I'm sorry. I guess I just
got blindsided yesterday.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.185
It blew me away, too. I didn't want
the headache, but then I thought

36:53.186 --> 36:56.147
all of this is part
of something amazing.

36:56.148 --> 36:58.482
Life stuff, renewal, rebuilding.

36:58.483 --> 37:00.568
Yes, exactly.

37:00.569 --> 37:02.403
I mean, this chrysalis has served us

37:02.404 --> 37:04.697
as we developed from pupae to adult,

37:04.698 --> 37:07.158
and now it has to be shed and eaten.

37:07.159 --> 37:09.535
What are we talking about?

37:09.536 --> 37:11.162
I really want to utilize this capital

37:11.163 --> 37:12.872
to right some major wrongs,

37:12.873 --> 37:14.915
educate some mysteries,
set some ideas free.

37:14.916 --> 37:18.336
Well, why don't I find a way
to manage my finances

37:18.337 --> 37:20.263
so I can support you in eight months

37:20.264 --> 37:22.631
after you've pissed away what
it took Dad a lifetime to make.

37:22.632 --> 37:24.100
I hear where you're coming from,

37:24.101 --> 37:27.887
but it's just money. It doesn't
mean Dad loved me more than you.

37:27.888 --> 37:28.488
What?

37:28.489 --> 37:30.765
It doesn't mean Dad
loved me more than you.

37:30.766 --> 37:33.434
He didn't... love you more.

37:33.435 --> 37:36.567
You were the squeaky wheel,
so you got all the oil.

37:38.273 --> 37:40.274
And if I were you,

37:40.275 --> 37:44.746
I wouldn't rush off to go
change the world quite yet.

37:50.660 --> 37:52.620
Hello...

37:52.621 --> 37:54.538
Anybody?

37:54.539 --> 37:56.382
I'm going to go now.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.802
Ben?

38:07.803 --> 38:09.428
Ben?

38:09.429 --> 38:11.226
Yeah, I'm up here.

38:13.558 --> 38:15.601
Look at you.

38:15.602 --> 38:18.646
- Master of all that you survey.
- Yeah.

38:18.647 --> 38:21.482
You know, I wouldn't go if I
didn't have this job thing.

38:21.483 --> 38:23.901
I'll be back out next
weekend, I promise.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.237
Plus, you can always call.

38:26.238 --> 38:29.990
Oh, I'll call. I'll call as soon as
I get that big fat check for you.

38:29.991 --> 38:33.461
Hey, you know, I didn't think you
were really going to do that.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.162
Hey, buddy?

38:35.163 --> 38:36.915
I love you.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.718
Take a shower, okay?

38:48.301 --> 38:49.927
Wait, so you're just going to leave?

38:49.928 --> 38:51.929
Yeah, I got to get going.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.348
It was really great to see you,
and thanks for the pie.

38:54.349 --> 38:55.599
That was for dinner.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.809
I'll be eating dinner.

38:56.810 --> 38:58.519
No, for everyone.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.312
You're not as giving
as I thought you were.

39:00.313 --> 39:02.523
I don't want the pie back. I just...

39:02.524 --> 39:04.358
Well, I guess you know Ben
better than I do.

39:04.359 --> 39:06.318
Is he going to be
okay here by himself?

39:06.319 --> 39:07.778
By himself?

39:07.779 --> 39:09.822
What, now you're going to leave?

39:09.823 --> 39:11.657
- I mean, with that poor kid up there?
- So he's not okay.

39:11.658 --> 39:13.117
He's right as rain.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.368
I mean, his father just died,

39:14.369 --> 39:16.162
he's got a drug problem,

39:16.163 --> 39:18.414
probably some kind of
manic-depressive disorder,

39:18.415 --> 39:22.001
and honestly, he wasn't that well
screwed together to begin with,

39:22.002 --> 39:24.503
but he's an adult,
and I have to go back

39:24.504 --> 39:26.130
to do the 4:30 weather.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.215
And although
you're under no obligation

39:28.216 --> 39:31.218
would it be so bad to take
another two or three weeks

39:31.219 --> 39:33.637
before you do whatever
bullshit you have to do?

39:33.638 --> 39:37.057
You mean teaching disabled kids?

39:37.058 --> 39:38.893
Oh, now they're disabled.

39:38.894 --> 39:41.647
Do you have any actual plans?

39:44.441 --> 39:47.485
- I guess I could take my time moving out.
- Great.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.777
You get a week,

39:48.778 --> 39:50.529
and I'm not adopting him.

39:50.530 --> 39:52.782
Perfect. I'm going
to leave you my number...

39:53.742 --> 39:55.534
in case you have to get in touch.

39:55.535 --> 39:58.538
Because, you know, I'm on TV.

40:01.458 --> 40:05.586
Yeah, actually Sam
bragged about you once.

40:05.587 --> 40:08.088
I think he liked you, but he
couldn't really express it.

40:08.089 --> 40:11.509
Yeah, it always came out
as "moron-troublemaker."

40:11.510 --> 40:13.552
He hated the Irish, too.

40:13.553 --> 40:15.396
People forget that.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.767
Okay, now will you let me know
if I run over a chicken,

40:19.768 --> 40:22.603
'cause the pie
is all I can eat right now.

40:22.604 --> 40:24.188
How long does he stay up there?

40:24.189 --> 40:26.032
Let me know.

40:49.297 --> 40:51.757
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:51.758 --> 40:53.592
How are you holding up?

40:53.593 --> 40:55.636
[SIGHS] I don't know.

40:55.637 --> 40:57.263
It's all temporary, right?

40:57.264 --> 40:59.098
Angela, you knew when you decided

40:59.099 --> 41:01.433
to get involved with
a man so much older

41:01.434 --> 41:03.269
it wasn't for life.

41:03.270 --> 41:05.729
You are so sentimental.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.231
Okay, all's I'm saying

41:07.232 --> 41:09.066
is that you had that experience.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.318
Now don't be afraid
to be with a man your age.

41:11.319 --> 41:13.036
You got a whole time ahead.

41:15.198 --> 41:16.907
Ben asked me to put these up.

41:16.908 --> 41:19.994
I have some. They upset people.

41:19.995 --> 41:21.996
Hey, Mom. Sam Stallsworth is outside.

41:21.997 --> 41:23.664
You're going to have to
negotiate the lettuce with him.

41:23.665 --> 41:24.999
Now listen, I've got to go.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.334
I might need my hands.

41:27.335 --> 41:29.253
Okay.

41:29.254 --> 41:31.552
- Hello, Terri.
- Good morning, sunshine.

41:36.928 --> 41:38.846
It's hard, huh...

41:38.847 --> 41:40.180
without him?

41:40.181 --> 41:41.853
Yeah, try to keep busy.

41:44.227 --> 41:46.020
Uh, about Ben.

41:46.021 --> 41:48.355
Oh, God, don't stick
your nose in that, too.

41:48.356 --> 41:50.391
I'm living with him, Terri.

41:50.392 --> 41:53.360
Nobody asked you to. In fact, I'm
surprised you didn't blow out of town

41:53.361 --> 41:54.695
on the next guy who came through.

41:54.696 --> 41:57.197
Oh, Jesus. That tongue.

41:57.198 --> 41:59.700
I think you just spoiled
all the vegetables in here.

41:59.701 --> 42:01.994
You know, you came
into my family very recently,

42:01.995 --> 42:04.204
and you started telling
everybody what to do,

42:04.205 --> 42:05.623
which was nothing.

42:05.624 --> 42:07.791
- Do nothing.
- That is not true.

42:07.792 --> 42:10.669
You convinced my father to let
a thriving business go to seed.

42:10.670 --> 42:12.212
"These are the good years.

42:12.213 --> 42:13.714
"Life is for living."

42:13.715 --> 42:15.633
I mean, Christ, a man his age

42:15.634 --> 42:18.469
throwing himself at yoga
and guitar lessons?

42:18.470 --> 42:19.720
You don't believe in growing!

42:19.721 --> 42:21.347
You don't grow!

42:21.348 --> 42:23.057
You're a tumbleweed

42:23.058 --> 42:25.142
who blows around
whenever the wind changes.

42:25.143 --> 42:28.228
Shit, I swore I wouldn't engage.

42:28.229 --> 42:29.688
I got to go.

42:29.689 --> 42:31.816
You know, people hide in charity.

42:33.443 --> 42:36.362
Once in a while, assume other
people are as good as you.

42:36.363 --> 42:38.035
Not worse.

42:39.783 --> 42:41.455
They're not.

42:43.453 --> 42:45.371
(VICTORIA) How was the vacation?

42:45.372 --> 42:46.997
It wasn't a vacation.

42:46.998 --> 42:49.041
Oh, did you get your eyes done?

42:49.042 --> 42:52.378
- Delia got some fan mail, you know.
- Is that right?

42:52.379 --> 42:54.046
A hundred bucks says Delia's fan mail

42:54.047 --> 42:56.090
came from a member
of the cafeteria staff.

42:56.091 --> 42:57.925
[MAN] Corporate thinks
each piece of mail

42:57.926 --> 43:00.052
represents 1000 viewers.

43:00.053 --> 43:02.096
What, did she do a really good job?

43:02.097 --> 43:04.848
Hey, what was with you wrestling
that bum the other day?

43:04.849 --> 43:08.727
- Nicely done.
- So did you know him or something?

43:08.728 --> 43:10.771
You know how it is, you buy
someone a cup of coffee

43:10.772 --> 43:13.691
and suddenly they're
your best friend.

43:13.692 --> 43:16.285
- Do I need my eyes done?
- 30 seconds.

43:16.286 --> 43:18.362
It would be illegal
to make them any bluer.

43:18.363 --> 43:20.864
See, that's what I think.

43:20.865 --> 43:22.491
Spinach check.

43:23.535 --> 43:26.078
You have no whitening trays.

43:26.079 --> 43:28.422
Now I really can't stay.

43:32.335 --> 43:35.421
God, it must be tough
having to win the viewers over

43:35.422 --> 43:38.465
one at a time like this.

43:38.466 --> 43:41.885
You know, while you were off getting
your eyes done over the weekend,

43:41.886 --> 43:45.305
Paul flew me to Martha's
Vineyard to show me this house

43:45.306 --> 43:50.102
and it wasn't one of those stupid
Cape Cod houses the tourists love.

43:50.103 --> 43:52.062
This was a year-round home

43:52.063 --> 43:54.565
where you could really be
a part of the island.

43:54.566 --> 43:57.317
Paul understands the
limitations of our job

43:57.318 --> 43:58.485
and let's face it,

43:58.486 --> 44:00.070
it's a short window,

44:00.071 --> 44:01.739
and it's not really based on skill.

44:01.740 --> 44:03.407
Yeah, I know that.

44:03.408 --> 44:05.159
Lucky for me, my finances

44:05.160 --> 44:07.911
have kind of been
taking care of themselves.

44:07.912 --> 44:09.788
Sandwich guy told me
you nailed the baseball pool.

44:09.789 --> 44:12.666
No, really, I'm coming
into a little piece of property

44:12.667 --> 44:14.334
up in Lancaster myself.

44:14.335 --> 44:16.003
I'll probably unload it.

44:16.004 --> 44:17.838
Brian Williams has a place up there.

44:17.839 --> 44:20.216
I don't think so.

44:22.343 --> 44:25.179
Thanks for the ride.

44:25.180 --> 44:29.141
Which is why I'm sick and
tired of the bullshit.

44:29.142 --> 44:30.934
Excuse me, sorry.

44:30.935 --> 44:32.269
I was just passing through.

44:32.270 --> 44:34.613
Sit, please. Join us.

44:36.775 --> 44:39.485
Everybody, this is Angela...

44:39.486 --> 44:41.329
my stepmother.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.876
Didn't we meet
at the plastic bag rally?

44:47.952 --> 44:50.162
Your skin is so white.

44:50.163 --> 44:52.131
I think we should listen now.

44:54.125 --> 44:57.544
If we create a nonprofit society,

44:57.545 --> 44:59.546
we can reap the tax benefits

44:59.547 --> 45:00.964
of said society.

45:00.965 --> 45:02.883
It is going to be a beginning

45:02.884 --> 45:05.010
and an ending of life as we know it

45:05.011 --> 45:07.888
and that is why I am calling it

45:07.889 --> 45:09.561
The Omega Society.

45:11.142 --> 45:13.227
I hate to stick my nose
into this, but...

45:13.228 --> 45:16.230
No, everyone's voice has equal merit.

45:16.231 --> 45:19.316
The Omega Society sounds like
the Omega Institute.

45:19.317 --> 45:21.902
It's a holistic organization,

45:21.903 --> 45:25.697
environmentalism, spiritual rebirth.

45:25.698 --> 45:28.408
It's total synchronicity
is what it is.

45:28.409 --> 45:31.203
Not only is it the perfect name
for our society,

45:31.204 --> 45:33.831
but it already exists.

45:33.832 --> 45:36.083
I think there's
an Omega Society, too,

45:36.084 --> 45:37.751
so I don't think legally we can...

45:37.752 --> 45:40.587
Justin, it's not about what is legal.

45:40.588 --> 45:42.506
I grew up out here.

45:42.507 --> 45:44.675
There are Amish people
on three sides of this farm.

45:44.676 --> 45:47.553
They don't vote.
They don't join the Army.

45:47.554 --> 45:51.223
They don't send their children
to our schools.

45:51.224 --> 45:54.560
When you live off the land,

45:54.561 --> 45:56.061
and you're honest,

45:56.062 --> 45:58.485
things fall into place.

46:00.775 --> 46:04.870
You are a beacon
to that Babylon out there.

46:05.697 --> 46:08.031
My cousin lives in Oregon.

46:08.032 --> 46:09.454
Ben's right.

46:16.124 --> 46:19.293
So I've never seen you
at the Marriott before.

46:19.294 --> 46:21.461
Oh, I really shouldn't.

46:21.462 --> 46:24.047
You just going to go home and
stare at an empty dog bed?

46:24.048 --> 46:25.966
Chester doesn't get home
from the hospital

46:25.967 --> 46:28.760
till tomorrow, right?

46:28.761 --> 46:30.596
His name is Clarence.

46:30.597 --> 46:32.639
He got out of the hospital today,

46:32.640 --> 46:35.309
and my mom is watching him.

46:35.310 --> 46:36.810
But you sure are a good listener.

46:36.811 --> 46:38.312
So are you,

46:38.313 --> 46:40.690
and a very beautiful one actually.

46:47.530 --> 46:49.489
I think Clarence needs me.

46:49.490 --> 46:51.408
Seriously, I'm really fast.

46:51.409 --> 46:52.993
[PHONE BUZZES]

46:52.994 --> 46:54.661
Did you give my number to someone?

46:54.662 --> 46:55.996
- I don't even have your...
- Shh, one second.

46:55.997 --> 46:58.090
Hello?

46:59.417 --> 47:01.293
I really didn't mean to bother you.

47:01.294 --> 47:04.004
Ben's fine, but we just got
this registered letter.

47:04.005 --> 47:05.505
Terri is challenging the will.

47:05.506 --> 47:07.466
Why? I mean, I know why,

47:07.467 --> 47:08.842
but under what grounds?

47:08.843 --> 47:11.011
Well, it's Ben's competency.

47:11.012 --> 47:14.181
There's going to be a hearing,
and he has to see a psychiatrist.

47:14.182 --> 47:16.016
Can you believe this?

47:16.017 --> 47:18.518
This morning, the bank
account was shut down.

47:18.519 --> 47:20.979
It's a classic obstacle to a pioneer.

47:20.980 --> 47:24.149
It's like Galileo or Che, or Jesus.

47:24.150 --> 47:26.193
Every great move has a counter move.

47:26.194 --> 47:28.862
But let me tell you,
my sister's greed

47:28.863 --> 47:31.198
is not going to stop the
evolution of mind and body

47:31.199 --> 47:32.866
that's going on out here.

47:32.867 --> 47:34.993
No, no, no, look.
You need to calm down.

47:34.994 --> 47:37.537
- Just get a lawyer.
- A law...

47:37.538 --> 47:38.705
You think I'm crazy now?

47:38.706 --> 47:40.624
Go see the shrink.

47:40.625 --> 47:42.718
It's like giving them the
money if you don't go.

47:44.295 --> 47:47.790
- I could be my own lawyer you know.
- There you go.

47:47.791 --> 47:50.634
I could prepare a brief, one of those
600-page obstructionist babies.

47:50.635 --> 47:53.103
They don't know
who they're fucking with.

47:59.644 --> 48:01.144
Hey, are you still there?

48:01.145 --> 48:03.522
Yes, any other fires to put out?

48:03.523 --> 48:05.732
It is just getting
more and more intense,

48:05.733 --> 48:08.201
and there are a lot of
other people involved now.

48:09.904 --> 48:12.739
Like you and me?

48:12.740 --> 48:14.866
No, I mean, there are
these hippie kids now

48:14.867 --> 48:18.245
and the store,
and now this court thing.

48:18.246 --> 48:20.205
He just seems very agitated.

48:20.206 --> 48:22.749
And I mean, I've been trying
to deal with it, but...

48:22.750 --> 48:25.585
[SIGHS]
I'm just glad I could call you.

48:25.586 --> 48:27.884
You can always call me.

48:29.215 --> 48:31.425
- I'm leaving.
- [WHISPERS] Maybe you should...

48:31.426 --> 48:33.677
Oh, my God. Is there someone there?

48:33.678 --> 48:36.763
No, I'm alone.

48:36.764 --> 48:38.098
Now.

48:38.099 --> 48:40.267
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

48:40.268 --> 48:43.562
You're just doing your job.

48:43.563 --> 48:45.815
My job, actually.

48:49.110 --> 48:50.777
Well, I don't really know him.

48:50.778 --> 48:54.573
He's Ben. He's a blast
most of the time.

48:54.574 --> 48:56.783
But you didn't know his mother.

48:56.784 --> 49:00.412
He inherited some things
that weren't in the will.

49:00.413 --> 49:02.748
Yeah, Sam mentioned that.

49:02.749 --> 49:06.793
Probably nothing like the free love,
whole foods thing you grew up in.

49:06.794 --> 49:11.089
My father was an actuary for The
Hartford insurance company.

49:11.090 --> 49:14.092
He died at his desk.
I was still at Andover.

49:14.093 --> 49:17.971
Huh. Like say about Sam's age?

49:17.972 --> 49:20.600
- What?
- So you must be loaded?

49:23.269 --> 49:25.145
Is he going to be okay or not?

49:25.146 --> 49:26.938
This is the way it usually goes.

49:26.939 --> 49:30.150
The best thing to do
is keep feeding him.

49:30.151 --> 49:32.152
Food is nature's Vicodin.

49:32.153 --> 49:35.031
That's good, too,
by the way, if you have it.

49:37.617 --> 49:40.744
You should finally be getting
some rain up that way, you know?

49:40.745 --> 49:44.044
Mm, I'm not too sure about that.

49:57.428 --> 49:59.179
Well...

49:59.180 --> 50:01.307
goodnight.

50:02.308 --> 50:04.526
Yeah, goodnight to you, too.

50:30.128 --> 50:32.505
[GRUNTS]

50:32.922 --> 50:34.844
[GROANS]

50:43.391 --> 50:44.891
Woo!

50:44.892 --> 50:47.060
Woo!

50:47.061 --> 50:49.313
Woo!

50:52.400 --> 50:54.698
Woo!

50:57.113 --> 50:59.656
Ben?

50:59.657 --> 51:02.159
- Ben?
- Is he ready?

51:02.160 --> 51:05.078
Ben, Terri's here.

51:05.079 --> 51:06.830
I can't believe you're doing this.

51:06.831 --> 51:09.249
Yeah, well I can't believe
you're still here.

51:09.250 --> 51:11.042
Ben?

51:11.043 --> 51:13.837
Benji. We're going
to the doctor, okay?

51:13.838 --> 51:15.965
There isn't anything to be...

51:17.383 --> 51:19.100
Ben?

51:23.556 --> 51:25.148
Great.

51:35.526 --> 51:37.528
Why aren't you inside?

51:41.407 --> 51:43.204
Greetings.

51:47.580 --> 51:49.456
Sorry to keep bothering
you like that.

51:49.457 --> 51:51.458
I don't think
getting a glass of water

51:51.459 --> 51:53.793
is the biggest inconvenience
for these people right now.

51:53.794 --> 51:56.087
I was just explaining my admiration

51:56.088 --> 51:57.631
for these people.

51:57.632 --> 51:59.382
They live off the land in kindness.

51:59.383 --> 52:01.801
They don't believe
in war or pollution.

52:01.802 --> 52:05.805
I'll tell you. One day, when there's
no earth left, because we used it up,

52:05.806 --> 52:09.310
there will be 10 square miles of
Lancaster County where God still exists.

52:10.519 --> 52:12.395
Why are you naked?

52:12.396 --> 52:14.981
I didn't want that chemical
smell on me anymore.

52:14.982 --> 52:17.108
That smell is not chemicals.

52:17.109 --> 52:19.486
It's B.O. because you
have stopped showering

52:19.487 --> 52:21.780
and you ruined everything
I bought you at The Gap,

52:21.781 --> 52:24.115
- which you loved.
- I don't anymore.

52:24.116 --> 52:25.742
We are going.

52:25.743 --> 52:27.619
This entire incident is inappropriate

52:27.620 --> 52:30.664
and probably illegal,
and if I were Mr. Yoder,

52:30.665 --> 52:33.500
I would make you pay for the fact
that I missed two hours of farmwork

52:33.501 --> 52:35.752
so I could ride into town on a buggy

52:35.753 --> 52:37.420
to get a cop out here.

52:37.421 --> 52:39.589
You're wrong.
We're having a conversation!

52:39.590 --> 52:41.508
I don't want
to speak out of turn here,

52:41.509 --> 52:44.177
but Felty and Sarah
are not being hospitable.

52:44.178 --> 52:47.180
They're pacifists,
and this is how they respond

52:47.181 --> 52:49.399
to being held hostage.

52:59.819 --> 53:01.528
Gosh, I'm...

53:01.529 --> 53:03.363
I-I never meant to... I didn't...

53:03.364 --> 53:05.832
Ben, I think you can keep the apron.

53:08.619 --> 53:09.995
Let's go.

53:11.497 --> 53:14.040
Yes, the best way to get
the soda out of the bottle

53:14.041 --> 53:16.876
is to shake it and
shake it and shake it.

53:16.877 --> 53:18.503
You need a ride?

53:19.213 --> 53:20.464
Yes.

53:25.469 --> 53:27.262
Next time, go over to the highway

53:27.263 --> 53:29.055
and get Anderson
to ring the fire bell for you.

53:29.056 --> 53:30.724
I will. I apologize.

53:30.725 --> 53:32.684
I might have been
in a bit of a panic.

53:32.685 --> 53:35.854
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Yoder.

53:35.855 --> 53:38.023
I am sorry to hear about your father.

53:38.024 --> 53:39.399
Thank you very much.

53:39.400 --> 53:41.234
We all miss him, obviously.

53:41.235 --> 53:43.903
He was lucky to have a long life.

53:43.904 --> 53:45.572
Such a caring daughter.

53:45.573 --> 53:48.491
All he cared about was his family.

53:48.492 --> 53:51.791
Surely there's no other reason
for being on this Earth.

53:53.664 --> 53:56.374
What would you do if you
couldn't have children?

53:56.375 --> 53:59.469
I would pray to God
to send them to me.

54:00.463 --> 54:02.636
What if you don't believe in God?

54:05.384 --> 54:07.682
Maybe that's why
you can't have children.

54:15.102 --> 54:18.063
Honestly, Ben,
you really fucked me here.

54:18.064 --> 54:20.357
My independence of mind
is obviously a threat to them.

54:20.358 --> 54:22.901
- Them?
- Society.

54:22.902 --> 54:24.361
With all their poison.

54:24.362 --> 54:26.237
I'm not putting it in my body.

54:26.238 --> 54:28.365
And I respect that deep-fried
temple that you built,

54:28.366 --> 54:31.743
but you have to stop running naked.

54:31.744 --> 54:33.787
I know. I panicked.

54:33.788 --> 54:36.122
Even the most committed messenger
has a moment of doubt.

54:36.123 --> 54:37.874
Keep that word "committed" in mind.

54:37.875 --> 54:39.959
- Next time.
- Oh, you mean in the courtroom?

54:39.960 --> 54:41.544
Because that's where we're heading,

54:41.545 --> 54:43.213
and they might not stop
with the money.

54:43.214 --> 54:44.923
They can force you
to take the medicine,

54:44.924 --> 54:47.300
- and they can lock you up.

54:50.304 --> 54:51.388
Not really.

54:51.389 --> 54:53.306
I got to go.

54:53.307 --> 54:55.141
Ben, you okay?

54:55.142 --> 54:58.144
I don't know. I'm feeling
a little stressed out.

54:58.145 --> 54:59.979
I'm stressed out. You're crazy.

54:59.980 --> 55:03.274
Let's use the word freely
as if it gives us power.

55:03.275 --> 55:04.822
Goodnight.

55:13.452 --> 55:15.495
I see you've been arrested
a few times.

55:15.496 --> 55:17.414
Public outbursts, indecency.

55:17.415 --> 55:19.749
A misdemeanor
related to your profession

55:19.750 --> 55:23.002
which you listed here
as "small farmer."

55:23.003 --> 55:26.256
I also see that you've
never considered medication.

55:26.257 --> 55:28.341
Anti-depressants?

55:28.342 --> 55:30.635
They have been suggested,

55:30.636 --> 55:33.680
as they have been to most of America.

55:33.681 --> 55:36.099
Well, I was thinking
more like a mood stabilizer,

55:36.100 --> 55:38.810
which for most is a very
effective therapeutic solution.

55:38.811 --> 55:43.148
No need to resist
the magic of lithium, I know.

55:43.149 --> 55:46.526
We should sprinkle its salty goodness
over the fries at McDonald's

55:46.527 --> 55:49.904
until we're "Dawn of the Dead"
drooling towards Banana Republic,

55:49.905 --> 55:51.990
pushing our carts
dazed through the market,

55:51.991 --> 55:53.741
throwing the meat in,

55:53.742 --> 55:57.621
black blood pooling
under so much plastic.

55:58.456 --> 56:00.290
That's an interesting image.

56:00.291 --> 56:02.208
Which I wouldn't have
if I was zonked on that shit.

56:02.209 --> 56:04.252
I wouldn't feel
this hum I've got going.

56:04.253 --> 56:06.838
Clear, sharp, and purposeful,

56:06.839 --> 56:09.883
like every ion in my body
is vibrating with genius.

56:09.884 --> 56:11.718
Marijuana is a chemical.

56:11.719 --> 56:13.219
It's green and from the Earth.

56:13.220 --> 56:14.846
But it's a drug,

56:14.847 --> 56:16.681
a way of dealing with your symptoms.

56:16.682 --> 56:18.558
Like the drug you get
when you go into a restaurant

56:18.559 --> 56:20.560
or come home after work,

56:20.561 --> 56:22.896
or offer a stranger the moment
they come into your house.

56:22.897 --> 56:27.066
Our whole social system
is built around some drug.

56:27.067 --> 56:29.911
Most cultures made beer
before they had an alphabet.

56:31.530 --> 56:33.239
I'm going to ask you some questions,

56:33.240 --> 56:36.409
and you can just tell me
yes or no, okay?

56:36.410 --> 56:40.130
Do you experience sensations
of things that are not there?

56:41.957 --> 56:44.050
Do you hear voices?

56:48.881 --> 56:50.974
Are you afraid right now?

56:54.845 --> 56:57.473
There are times that are wonderful,

56:59.433 --> 57:01.601
and there are times
that are horrible.

57:01.602 --> 57:05.647
And the wonderful thing is
right now, I feel alive.

57:05.648 --> 57:07.774
But the terrible thing is
that you're not asking me

57:07.775 --> 57:09.484
how I feel about my father dying.

57:09.485 --> 57:11.069
Oh, well I was going...

57:11.070 --> 57:13.738
I feel alone in the universe,

57:13.739 --> 57:15.456
except for Steve.

57:19.703 --> 57:22.251
So why do you think you're here?

57:25.209 --> 57:27.293
Because I won the lottery.

57:27.294 --> 57:29.796
Everybody's got their hand out.

58:13.132 --> 58:14.716
You got to get rid of it.

58:14.717 --> 58:17.051
The building is called The Oaks.

58:17.052 --> 58:18.386
It's the only one left.

58:18.387 --> 58:20.346
It's just a tree.

58:20.347 --> 58:21.973
It blocks all the natural light,

58:21.974 --> 58:24.809
Plus, it decreases
the value of my unit.

58:24.810 --> 58:27.228
I can circulate a petition
if you want,

58:27.229 --> 58:29.147

everybody feels the same,

58:29.148 --> 58:32.401

Were you on the phone?

59:12.066 --> 59:13.783
No.

59:21.867 --> 59:24.077
My diagnosis, as I wrote,

59:24.078 --> 59:26.204
is classic bipolar disorder.

59:26.205 --> 59:28.206
Euphoric with schizoid tendencies.

59:28.207 --> 59:31.250
[WHISPERS] See? I told you.

59:31.251 --> 59:33.461
So in your assessment, Dr. Vincent,

59:33.462 --> 59:35.713
you see Mr. Baker as being incapable

59:35.714 --> 59:37.632
of understanding any consequences

59:37.633 --> 59:38.758
for his actions.

59:38.759 --> 59:40.468
Yes.

59:40.469 --> 59:43.429
That is all we have
to say, Your Honor.

59:43.430 --> 59:45.098
Uh, Mr. Baker...

59:45.099 --> 59:46.724
have you been having difficulty

59:46.725 --> 59:48.476
distinguishing
between real and unreal?

59:48.477 --> 59:50.729
My whole life.

59:53.816 --> 59:56.067
This is a very serious diagnosis.

59:56.068 --> 01:00:00.823
Would you describe him as a danger
to himself or to other people?

01:00:01.782 --> 01:00:03.616
Actually, I would say no.

01:00:03.617 --> 01:00:05.284
Not at this moment.

01:00:05.285 --> 01:00:07.745
It is, of course,
completely possible.

01:00:07.746 --> 01:00:09.580
Well, I'm prepared to rule on this.

01:00:09.581 --> 01:00:11.499
Mr. Baker, Ms. Coulter,

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.127
I have to agree
with Dr. Vincent's finding

01:00:14.128 --> 01:00:17.797
that Mr. Baker is... I'm sorry to talk
about you as though you weren't here,

01:00:17.798 --> 01:00:20.633
but this 11-page handwritten brief

01:00:20.634 --> 01:00:22.176
didn't help, son.

01:00:22.177 --> 01:00:25.430
He is seriously mentally troubled.

01:00:25.431 --> 01:00:27.306
And he's likely to behave
with this money

01:00:27.307 --> 01:00:30.143
in a extremely irresponsible manner.

01:00:30.144 --> 01:00:32.311
But hopefully, he won't,

01:00:32.312 --> 01:00:35.314
because as long as he's not a
threat to himself or other people,

01:00:35.315 --> 01:00:38.693
he can go out and buy the world's
largest hat, if he wants to.

01:00:38.694 --> 01:00:41.446
Your Honor, you don't understand.

01:00:41.447 --> 01:00:44.365
Look, your father could have
left his money to his dog.

gave me the message.

- Steve, this is Zed Starkevitch.

01:03:44.796 --> 01:03:47.469
You, your face.

01:03:49.384 --> 01:03:50.801
I don't know what to say.

01:03:50.802 --> 01:03:53.270
Because you like me.

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:05.450
What?

01:04:06.777 --> 01:04:09.195
Kiss me again
or slap me or something,

01:04:09.196 --> 01:04:11.906
but you got to stop looking
at me all beautiful like that,

01:04:11.907 --> 01:04:14.375
or you're going to get more of this.

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:17.836
So you'd like more?

01:04:18.497 --> 01:04:21.082
I don't know.

01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:22.500
I don't know who you are.

01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:24.669
[SIGHS] I know it's horrible.

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:26.337
But this is really it.

01:04:26.338 --> 01:04:27.922
This is who I am.

01:04:27.923 --> 01:04:29.382
There's some good in it, I promise.

01:04:29.383 --> 01:04:30.758

You're always stoned.

Actually, I'm drunk right now,

01:04:36.682 --> 01:04:38.391

"Loves to have a good time."

That's what I mean.

I eat life out of the big box.

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:46.232
I'm not hiding out here in the sticks

01:04:46.233 --> 01:04:48.359
or wherever it is
you're going to next.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.069
Doesn't it seem strange

01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:53.406
that someone who
eats life like you do,

01:04:53.407 --> 01:04:56.367
who has it all,
is trying to escape it?

01:04:56.368 --> 01:04:58.202
I like you.

01:04:58.203 --> 01:05:00.746
I bet you haven't had
an interaction with anyone

01:05:00.747 --> 01:05:03.582
in the last ten years
that wasn't warped somehow.

01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:08.087
My guess is you got some kind
of freefall going on in there,

01:05:08.088 --> 01:05:11.465
but you hide it all
under this veil of charm

01:05:11.466 --> 01:05:14.468

to real interaction.

People treat the environment
like it's a big toilet.

01:05:54.092 --> 01:05:56.469
They can dump everything they
don't want, and flush it down,

01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:58.345
and they're never
going to see it again.

01:05:58.346 --> 01:06:00.769
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:03.100
Excuse me?

01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:05.144
People get a little bit of money,

01:06:05.145 --> 01:06:07.980
all of a sudden, they think
everything they say is true.

01:06:07.981 --> 01:06:09.940
You're still a big fat nothing.

01:06:09.941 --> 01:06:11.358

Did you hear what he said to me?

I just ordered a beer.

That's all he said.

again on Thursday, okay?

01:10:05.176 --> 01:10:08.262
It's incredible that a woman
with such a great hangover cure

01:10:08.263 --> 01:10:09.847
would be against drinking.

01:10:09.848 --> 01:10:12.224
I'm not against drinking.

come back to the city with me,

going to say about cities,

01:18:12.997 --> 01:18:14.664
but you'd never been skiing.

01:18:14.665 --> 01:18:16.208
Then you told her
you'd never been skiing,

01:18:16.209 --> 01:18:18.084
and you sold me out, remember?

01:18:18.085 --> 01:18:20.545
Forget about skiing.
You're talking stupid shit.

01:18:20.546 --> 01:18:22.714
I need you to take this
seriously for once.

01:18:22.715 --> 01:18:24.049
Take something seriously!

01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:25.675
Oh, I get it.

01:18:25.676 --> 01:18:27.552
You're strong. All has been revealed.

01:18:27.553 --> 01:18:29.179
I'm just saying this is my problem,

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.722
and you're exacerbating it.

01:18:30.723 --> 01:18:33.016
You are truly batshit.

01:18:33.017 --> 01:18:35.477
I'm sure it's scary to take fixing
me off your list of things to do,

01:18:35.478 --> 01:18:37.062
because all that's left
is fixing you.

01:18:37.063 --> 01:18:38.396
Oh, wow.

01:18:38.397 --> 01:18:40.065
Thank you for that.

01:18:40.066 --> 01:18:41.733
Yeah, 'cause I'm
the selfish one here.

01:18:41.734 --> 01:18:43.652
There's no chance you're the asshole.

01:18:43.653 --> 01:18:47.197
Look, you don't know me,
and you don't owe me, okay?

01:18:47.198 --> 01:18:50.867
Well, if you feel the need to punch
me in the balls knock yourself out.

01:18:50.868 --> 01:18:55.669
I'll try to clear my schedule for the
next time the clarity wears off.

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:03.505
Are you going?

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:04.881
Yeah, I got to get back.

01:19:04.882 --> 01:19:06.383
Oh.

01:19:06.384 --> 01:19:08.885
I got the job, you know.

01:19:08.886 --> 01:19:11.721
No, of course.

01:19:11.722 --> 01:19:13.390
You don't want to walk me to the car?

01:19:13.391 --> 01:19:15.350
Well, if you're leaving,
you're leaving.

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:16.893
I mean, I can call you or something.

01:19:16.894 --> 01:19:18.562
Well, do you not want me to go?

01:19:18.563 --> 01:19:21.064
Well, it's not going to be easy here.

01:19:21.065 --> 01:19:23.567
And not because I'm pining for you.

01:19:23.568 --> 01:19:26.403
I mean, you know
I'm not going to leave.

01:19:26.404 --> 01:19:29.874
You're counting on it,
so really, you're just using me.

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:32.742
And throw in the fact that...

01:19:32.743 --> 01:19:34.578
maybe I do have feelings.

01:19:34.579 --> 01:19:36.621
Oh, God, so do I.

01:19:36.622 --> 01:19:40.792
No... half a day sobriety
isn't going to open that door.

01:19:40.793 --> 01:19:43.420
Oh, you can still
walk me outside, you know.

01:19:43.421 --> 01:19:45.297
No funny business, I promise.

01:19:45.298 --> 01:19:47.048
You should go.

01:19:47.049 --> 01:19:48.800
I'll stay here until I feel
okay about going.

01:19:48.801 --> 01:19:51.269
So you can feel okay about going.

01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:17.120
Now, about this tropical depression

01:20:17.121 --> 01:20:19.080
brewing off the Florida Keys,

01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:22.000
it's too early to tell if
this Gulf air will hold

01:20:22.001 --> 01:20:24.169
and create hurricane conditions.

01:20:24.170 --> 01:20:27.264
So Victoria, we will
keep an eye on that.

01:20:27.965 --> 01:20:29.174
Thank you, Steve.

01:20:29.175 --> 01:20:31.473
We certainly will.

01:20:33.137 --> 01:20:35.264
State officials announced today...

01:20:37.391 --> 01:20:39.809
Dallas? Steve Dallas?

01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:41.478
Yes, mein fuhrer...

01:20:41.479 --> 01:20:43.313
You know, for a second out there,

01:20:43.314 --> 01:20:45.607
I thought you were sober.

01:20:45.608 --> 01:20:48.151
Then I realized you're probably on
some drug I've never even heard of.

01:20:48.152 --> 01:20:49.986
Look at this shit.

01:20:49.987 --> 01:20:52.322
Why don't they get us tubes,
like astronauts?

01:20:52.323 --> 01:20:54.824
I don't know. The sandwiches
are pretty good.

01:20:54.825 --> 01:20:56.660
Chicken baloney?

01:20:56.661 --> 01:20:58.495
Do you have any idea
where that even comes from?

01:20:58.496 --> 01:21:00.872
Yeah, a chicken.

01:21:00.873 --> 01:21:03.091
It's a lot harder than that.

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:11.007
I didn't know you painted.

01:21:11.008 --> 01:21:12.851
I don't really.

01:21:13.803 --> 01:21:15.637
But somehow, tracing these lines

01:21:15.638 --> 01:21:17.514
is really going to help me
remember this place.

01:21:17.515 --> 01:21:19.057
'Cause let's face it,
the next time I come back

01:21:19.058 --> 01:21:20.392
it probably won't be here.

01:21:20.393 --> 01:21:22.520
Thanks for cheering me up.

01:21:23.521 --> 01:21:25.318
Try it.

01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:38.702
I really screwed up.

01:21:38.703 --> 01:21:41.126
It wasn't in your control.

01:21:43.165 --> 01:21:47.168
Gauguin packed up as far
from this craphole as possible.

01:21:47.169 --> 01:21:50.548
The world wasn't even one
tenth as polluted as it is now.

01:21:54.677 --> 01:21:57.020
You feel like packing up?

01:21:58.180 --> 01:21:59.514
No.

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:00.724
I don't even feel that.

01:22:00.725 --> 01:22:02.892
I just feel like...

01:22:02.893 --> 01:22:05.395
it's a pretty nice day, and...

01:22:05.396 --> 01:22:08.399
I hate myself for being the guy
who only has that to say.

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:25.874
Need another club soda, Mr. Dallas?

01:22:25.875 --> 01:22:28.418
Does anyone ever need
another club soda?

01:22:28.419 --> 01:22:30.253
What's going on here?

01:22:30.254 --> 01:22:32.088
Oh, a real estate seminar.

01:22:32.089 --> 01:22:35.217
Lot of ladies trying
to change their lives.

01:22:57.865 --> 01:22:59.949
Is it good?

01:22:59.950 --> 01:23:03.787
It's filled with bizarre details
and super weird bullshit.

01:23:03.788 --> 01:23:06.791
You've never read anything
you liked that was like that?

01:23:07.374 --> 01:23:08.917
It was not me.

01:23:08.918 --> 01:23:10.919
Actually, it was me.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.296
That's what makes it so depressing.
Now it's just this.

01:23:13.297 --> 01:23:16.050
Unfinished, unfocused, unrelenting.

01:23:20.054 --> 01:23:23.640
I'm a guy in a desert that's
running towards a mirage.

01:23:23.641 --> 01:23:26.815
I'm still really thirsty,
and my mouth is full of sand.

01:23:28.437 --> 01:23:30.146
Write that down.

01:23:30.147 --> 01:23:32.399
I don't think it's mine.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.151
It's going to take time.

01:23:35.152 --> 01:23:36.986
I just wish it was some
crippling depression

01:23:36.987 --> 01:23:39.364
instead of this disappointment.

01:23:39.365 --> 01:23:41.116
How do you all live
here without looking

01:23:41.117 --> 01:23:43.034
for a high place to jump from?

01:23:43.035 --> 01:23:45.788
I can't sell you on life.

01:23:46.747 --> 01:23:48.373
Because there's nothing to it.

01:23:48.374 --> 01:23:50.500
[BEN CRYING]

01:23:50.501 --> 01:23:51.968
Nothing at all.

01:23:57.967 --> 01:24:00.469
Life doesn't stand up to thinking.

01:24:01.846 --> 01:24:03.513
Smell the air out there.

01:24:03.514 --> 01:24:05.687
There are wonders.

01:24:15.484 --> 01:24:18.486
All I feel is time passing.

01:24:18.487 --> 01:24:20.785
And it's overwhelming.

01:24:21.699 --> 01:24:24.033
I wasted so much.

01:24:24.034 --> 01:24:26.035
I gobbled it all down

01:24:26.036 --> 01:24:28.664
without even tasting it.

01:24:29.707 --> 01:24:31.374
So start over.

01:24:31.375 --> 01:24:33.843
Just like that.

01:25:11.916 --> 01:25:15.545
[FAN WHIRRING]

01:26:15.604 --> 01:26:18.903
I'm sorry. I'm going to give it
ten more minutes if that's okay.

01:26:19.650 --> 01:26:21.572
That's decaf, right?

01:26:31.745 --> 01:26:33.497
Sorry I'm late.

01:26:38.502 --> 01:26:40.503
Oh, my God. You shaved.

01:26:40.504 --> 01:26:43.172
What can I say?
You know how erratic I am.

01:26:43.173 --> 01:26:45.049
What did you want to
talk to me about, Ben?

01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:47.002
Actually, I wanted to thank you.

01:26:47.003 --> 01:26:50.025
I didn't wait 40 minutes for you to
show up so we could have a fight.

01:26:50.026 --> 01:26:53.349
Terri, I mean it. I can't help but
think that... even through all this,

01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:58.021
that what Dad wanted was for us
to deal with all this together.

01:26:58.022 --> 01:27:00.356
I'm sorry, but I know you're
only one sentence away

01:27:00.357 --> 01:27:02.317
from telling me you
want to turn the store

01:27:02.318 --> 01:27:05.320
into an 1850's laundromat

01:27:05.321 --> 01:27:07.572
that runs on whale oil or something.

01:27:07.573 --> 01:27:09.699
Except God forbid
anybody hurt a whale.

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.452
No.

01:27:12.328 --> 01:27:15.705
I have become acutely aware

01:27:15.706 --> 01:27:17.248
of my limitations.

01:27:17.249 --> 01:27:18.791
And I guess what I'm saying is

01:27:18.792 --> 01:27:21.210
is that whatever you have in mind

01:27:21.211 --> 01:27:22.420
I'm okay with it.

01:27:22.421 --> 01:27:24.213
Excuse me?

01:27:24.214 --> 01:27:25.381
Are you wearing a wire?

01:27:25.382 --> 01:27:27.592
I'm serious.

01:27:27.593 --> 01:27:30.595
Well, I've been
tossing around the idea

01:27:30.596 --> 01:27:32.847
of converting the store
into something more modern.

01:27:32.848 --> 01:27:34.724
- And profitable?
- Is that a sin?

01:27:34.725 --> 01:27:36.851
No, that's good.
That's what I wanted to hear.

01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:38.394
Because I have some
plans for the farm.

01:27:38.395 --> 01:27:42.273
What, give it to Angela? Perfect.

01:27:42.274 --> 01:27:44.609
You don't even know her.

01:27:44.610 --> 01:27:47.445
Yeah, I know she has some freaky
power over all the men in my family.

01:27:47.446 --> 01:27:49.614
And that probably comes
from under her sundress.

01:27:49.615 --> 01:27:53.242
Terri, I'm asking you please.

01:27:53.243 --> 01:27:55.336
Don't talk about her like that.

01:27:58.582 --> 01:28:00.379
Okay...

01:28:02.878 --> 01:28:05.254
Okay.

01:28:05.255 --> 01:28:07.423
It's a million dollars
of undeveloped land.

01:28:07.424 --> 01:28:09.967
And that's why I want to have a
say about what happens to it.

01:28:09.968 --> 01:28:11.302
And you get lunch.

01:28:11.303 --> 01:28:14.138
Look, whatever it takes.

01:28:14.139 --> 01:28:16.937
I just don't want it
to be like this anymore.

01:28:25.526 --> 01:28:27.619
You look just like Dad.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:32.115
Okay, we feed in 15 seconds.

01:28:32.116 --> 01:28:33.616
Come on, people.

01:28:33.617 --> 01:28:35.076
I don't have a fucking image.

01:28:35.077 --> 01:28:37.161
All right, this is a newsroom.

01:28:37.162 --> 01:28:39.622
Can I get some people
walking back and forth please?

01:28:39.623 --> 01:28:42.091
And let's clean up this...
oh, forget it.

01:28:42.626 --> 01:28:45.503
Three, two...

01:28:45.504 --> 01:28:48.464
As promised, we're continuing
to track this storm

01:28:48.465 --> 01:28:50.258
now from the National Weather Service

01:28:50.259 --> 01:28:52.844
known officially as Hurricane Gordon

01:28:52.845 --> 01:28:56.139
about to make landfall
just south of Charleston here.

01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:58.641
Expect 85 mile-per-hour winds

01:28:58.642 --> 01:28:59.976
and flooding.

01:28:59.977 --> 01:29:01.644
Two to three inches per hour.

01:29:01.645 --> 01:29:03.396
Now you folks in the area,

01:29:03.397 --> 01:29:05.314
whether the government
makes you or not,

01:29:05.315 --> 01:29:07.483
just get yourselves out of there.

01:29:07.484 --> 01:29:10.319
Your lives are a hell of a lot
more important than your houses.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:14.031
This is Steve Dallas in the
Channel 18 Storm Center.

01:29:14.032 --> 01:29:17.493
Stay dry and stay safe.

01:29:17.494 --> 01:29:19.203
And we're out.

01:29:19.204 --> 01:29:21.205
Nicely done, yes!

01:29:21.206 --> 01:29:23.833
I loved that bit about the
people down in Charleston.

01:29:23.834 --> 01:29:25.668
Our local old ladies
are going to cream.

01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:27.795
From what Delia tells me,

01:29:27.796 --> 01:29:30.256
this is a hell of a storm. Those
people needed to be warned.

01:29:30.257 --> 01:29:33.342
Yeah, well those people
lost power six hours ago.

01:29:33.343 --> 01:29:35.311
They're not watching TV.

01:29:35.888 --> 01:29:38.514
Jesus, really?

01:29:38.515 --> 01:29:40.224
So why the hell are we doing this?

01:29:40.225 --> 01:29:42.143
Local people are interested.

01:29:42.144 --> 01:29:44.020
They might run us national

01:29:44.021 --> 01:29:46.523
unless those douchebags
in Baltimore snake us again.

01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:55.698
(BEN) I don't want to bother you.

01:29:55.699 --> 01:29:59.827
Oh, I'm just going through
some of your dad's stuff.

01:29:59.828 --> 01:30:02.705
I probably should have buried
him in his madras shorts.

01:30:02.706 --> 01:30:05.541
Would have felt more like a vacation.

01:30:05.542 --> 01:30:07.543
I talked to Terri like you suggested.

01:30:07.544 --> 01:30:08.878
It wasn't bad, right?

01:30:08.879 --> 01:30:10.046
It was great.

01:30:10.047 --> 01:30:12.173
And um...

01:30:12.174 --> 01:30:14.051
the other night, too.

01:30:15.469 --> 01:30:17.386
That really happened, didn't it?

01:30:17.387 --> 01:30:19.096
Yes.

01:30:19.097 --> 01:30:20.765
Yes, it did.

01:30:20.766 --> 01:30:22.725
I can't tell you how much that meant.

01:30:22.726 --> 01:30:26.230
Well, someone had to welcome
you back to the world.

01:30:29.525 --> 01:30:32.193
How did you end up with my dad?

01:30:32.194 --> 01:30:37.700
Uh... I guess it was all this.

01:30:40.035 --> 01:30:45.041
It's hard to resist the temptation
to step into a normal life.

01:30:46.542 --> 01:30:48.584
I know you told my dad
you didn't want anything.

01:30:48.585 --> 01:30:50.545
Yeah, I said that.

01:30:50.546 --> 01:30:53.256
And I really meant it, but...

01:30:53.257 --> 01:30:56.551
you think he would just give
me like one little thing.

01:30:56.552 --> 01:31:00.096
Anything, just for
sentimental reasons,

01:31:00.097 --> 01:31:01.764
a gesture.

01:31:01.765 --> 01:31:03.766
Well, you deserve whatever you want.

01:31:03.767 --> 01:31:05.226
I keep trying to find a way...

01:31:05.227 --> 01:31:08.271
No, no, no. Not from you.

01:31:08.272 --> 01:31:11.025
I mean, it's sweet. Thank you, but...

01:31:12.067 --> 01:31:14.443
it's not the same.

01:31:14.444 --> 01:31:17.363
I thought since, you know, you didn't
know what you were going to do

01:31:17.364 --> 01:31:19.782
that you could talk to Steve
about the farm and the house.

01:31:19.783 --> 01:31:21.826
I'm sure he doesn't know
what he's going to do either.

01:31:21.827 --> 01:31:23.327
What do you mean?

01:31:23.328 --> 01:31:25.922
I'm giving this all to Dallas.

01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:28.165
What?

01:31:28.166 --> 01:31:30.668
I promised it to him after the will.

01:31:30.669 --> 01:31:32.716
Huh.

01:31:34.089 --> 01:31:35.923
I didn't know that.

01:31:35.924 --> 01:31:37.842
It's an odd marriage,
but I kind of owed it to him.

01:31:37.843 --> 01:31:41.313
- Why, did you want it?
- No, mm-mm.

01:31:42.055 --> 01:31:43.139
Are you okay?

01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:46.350
Sure. You?

01:31:46.351 --> 01:31:49.445
Yeah, Terri's going to help
me find a smaller place.

01:31:52.608 --> 01:31:55.657
I'll never forget how you
held this family together.

01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:16.839
It's me. I hope I'm using this right.

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.799
It keeps asking me to press star,

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.344
which I don't think
we have on this phone.

01:32:21.345 --> 01:32:22.803
Oh, there it is.

01:32:22.804 --> 01:32:26.349
Uh, listen man...
[BEEP]

01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:27.683
Listen, man,
I know we haven't talked.

01:32:27.684 --> 01:32:29.644
I'm just going to say it.

01:32:29.645 --> 01:32:32.063
I miss you, and I've been
thinking about things

01:32:32.064 --> 01:32:33.856
and I want to make good on things.

01:32:33.857 --> 01:32:38.694
And I know Angela miss...
[BEEP]

01:32:38.695 --> 01:32:40.655
Okay, now I've got to talk fast,
because if I stop talking

01:32:40.656 --> 01:32:42.281
the thing will cut me off.

01:32:42.282 --> 01:32:43.658
Come down if you're ever free

01:32:43.659 --> 01:32:45.536
and I'm good, bye.

01:32:48.997 --> 01:32:50.999
Hello?

01:32:53.293 --> 01:32:56.253
Morning, slugger.
Four reports in six hours.

01:32:56.254 --> 01:32:58.214
Station manager's wet dream.

01:32:58.215 --> 01:33:00.508
You got two hours to get
cleaned up for your 12:30.

01:33:00.509 --> 01:33:03.779
- That's it. I'm done.
- What?

01:33:03.779 --> 01:33:06.889
I think it's time you find a
new entertainment reporter,

01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:09.016
someone who's comfortable with...

01:33:09.017 --> 01:33:10.685
what a waste of time this is,

01:33:10.686 --> 01:33:12.403
someone who isn't aware
of the fact that

01:33:12.404 --> 01:33:15.606
any six year old can stick
their arm out the window

01:33:15.607 --> 01:33:18.609
and tell you what it's
going to be like today.

01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:22.196
Dave, I would like to introduce you

01:33:22.197 --> 01:33:25.241
to Delia, an actual meteorologist

01:33:25.242 --> 01:33:27.576
and yeah, she doesn't
look like Miss America.

01:33:27.577 --> 01:33:29.912
She looks like someone
who went to MIT,

01:33:29.913 --> 01:33:31.455
because she did.

01:33:31.456 --> 01:33:33.249
Can't you ever just make it easy?

01:33:33.250 --> 01:33:36.627
Do you have to suck
the good out of everything?

01:33:36.628 --> 01:33:38.425
Good luck, sweetheart.

01:33:42.676 --> 01:33:44.553
He kissed me.

01:34:11.037 --> 01:34:12.955
Amish Farms Superstore?

01:34:12.956 --> 01:34:15.124
Yes, but without the question mark.

01:34:15.125 --> 01:34:17.001
If you believed in anything,

01:34:17.002 --> 01:34:19.670
you would realize this is
why people go to hell.

01:34:19.671 --> 01:34:21.005
Have you talked to Ben?

01:34:21.006 --> 01:34:22.298
Ben agreed to this?

01:34:22.299 --> 01:34:23.674
Underground parking?

01:34:23.675 --> 01:34:25.092
Honestly, we spoke,

01:34:25.093 --> 01:34:28.179
in rational means as a family and
this was the decision that we made.

01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.680
And luckily for the both of us

01:34:29.681 --> 01:34:31.265
you're not part of the family.

01:34:31.266 --> 01:34:32.933
No, no, congratulations. You won.

01:34:32.934 --> 01:34:34.435
And I don't mean
the battle over the will.

01:34:34.436 --> 01:34:36.312
I mean for biggest twat of the year.

01:34:36.313 --> 01:34:39.106
Boy, you really don't know
how to talk to a woman

01:34:39.107 --> 01:34:40.691
you're not trying to screw.

01:34:40.692 --> 01:34:42.359
Ben and I reconciled,

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.278
and your opposition
to that makes me feel

01:34:44.279 --> 01:34:45.988
like you just don't want to be alone

01:34:45.989 --> 01:34:48.199
in whatever weed-powered dance

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:50.785
you two have shared
for the last 25 years.

01:34:50.786 --> 01:34:52.703
I want him to get better.

01:34:52.704 --> 01:34:55.873
Then for once, leave him be.

01:34:55.874 --> 01:34:59.210
He is going to have
a lifetime of prosperity.

01:34:59.211 --> 01:35:02.430
And I'm sure he and Angela
will be very happy.

01:35:02.756 --> 01:35:04.590
What?

01:35:04.591 --> 01:35:07.009
Maybe it's sick, but those
two found each other.

01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:10.179
I know it sounds weird,
but I actually believe

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.889
that my brother and my stepmother

01:35:11.890 --> 01:35:13.390
belong together.

01:35:13.391 --> 01:35:16.560
Wait, they're together? Says who?

01:35:16.561 --> 01:35:19.730
Oh, Steve, they are.

01:35:19.731 --> 01:35:21.732
Sorry, you're going to have
to find someone else

01:35:21.733 --> 01:35:23.400
who's in worse shape than you now.

01:35:23.401 --> 01:35:25.869
- Go fuck yourself.
- Go fuck yourself, too.

01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:35.412
- Beard.
- Yeah.

01:35:35.413 --> 01:35:37.248
- You like it?
- Is Angela here?

01:35:37.249 --> 01:35:39.250
I don't know if you got my messages.

01:35:39.251 --> 01:35:41.085
I wanted you to come so I
could tell you the great news

01:35:41.086 --> 01:35:43.003
that the farm is yours

01:35:43.004 --> 01:35:45.089
- to do whatever you want with.
- Fan-fucking-tastic.

01:35:45.090 --> 01:35:46.257
Angela around?

01:35:46.258 --> 01:35:49.710
Now, don't be mad, but Terri's
going to get the store.

01:35:49.711 --> 01:35:52.346
- It's just the best way to go.
- That is great, great news.

01:35:52.347 --> 01:35:53.597
Do you know where Angela is?

01:35:53.598 --> 01:35:56.359
Are you okay?
I think she's upstairs.

01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.120
- Upstairs where you were just screwing her?
- What are you talking about?

01:36:00.122 --> 01:36:01.897
I don't know if you
were just screwing her.

01:36:01.898 --> 01:36:03.399
That's a weird thing to say.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.868
Really? Because it is sick.

01:36:07.863 --> 01:36:10.406
If it isn't Amish country's
own Mary Magdalene.

01:36:10.407 --> 01:36:11.883
Did you wash his feet first

01:36:11.884 --> 01:36:14.118
or just pull him down off
the cross and bone him?

01:36:14.119 --> 01:36:15.786
- Hold on. Calm down.
- What?

01:36:15.787 --> 01:36:17.538
- You're being very...
- No, stay out of this.

01:36:17.539 --> 01:36:19.081
I'm warning you, Ben.
Stay out of this.

01:36:19.082 --> 01:36:20.583
Why are you angry?

01:36:20.584 --> 01:36:22.126
Because you fucked my friend.

01:36:22.127 --> 01:36:24.628
- Who told you that?
- Everybody knows.

01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:26.297
That's none of your business.

01:36:26.298 --> 01:36:27.756
I guess nothing
was none of my business.

01:36:27.757 --> 01:36:31.468
I never promised you anything. You got
the farm. Isn't that what you wanted?

01:36:31.469 --> 01:36:34.242
Stop it! I'm not going to have the two
people I care about most in the world

01:36:34.243 --> 01:36:38.142
fight like this. You got it
all wrong. Now cool it.

01:36:38.143 --> 01:36:40.862
Fine, fine.

01:36:44.524 --> 01:36:46.071
What happened?

01:36:54.743 --> 01:36:57.953
Oh, God. This is so bad.

01:36:57.954 --> 01:37:01.832
You assholes, both of you.
Such assholes.

01:37:01.833 --> 01:37:05.669
You don't care about anything. Jesus,
you know what she means to me.

01:37:05.670 --> 01:37:07.755
It's not what you think.

01:37:07.756 --> 01:37:10.174
I-I didn't know, but it doesn't
change anything, I swear.

01:37:10.175 --> 01:37:11.926
The hell it doesn't!

01:37:11.927 --> 01:37:13.802
I thought I meant something to you.

01:37:13.803 --> 01:37:15.930
Because I thought you
were helping a sick friend,

01:37:15.931 --> 01:37:17.640
not making a real estate deal.

01:37:17.641 --> 01:37:19.350
What? I was!

01:37:19.351 --> 01:37:21.310
But aren't I entitled to something?

01:37:21.311 --> 01:37:23.187
Yes!

01:37:23.188 --> 01:37:25.022
You don't know where I have been,

01:37:25.023 --> 01:37:28.276
the shit I have done to deserve you.

01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:42.706
I talked to Terri...

01:37:42.707 --> 01:37:45.676
and it's yours to do
whatever you want with it.

01:37:46.753 --> 01:37:50.214
And... don't know
what to say except...

01:37:50.215 --> 01:37:51.840
I hope you take a look at yourself...

01:37:51.841 --> 01:37:53.968
and realize how much is there.

01:37:55.387 --> 01:37:57.054
Steve...

01:37:57.055 --> 01:37:59.398
you got to get your shit together.

01:38:07.315 --> 01:38:11.068
I hope one day you find out
what you really care about.

01:38:11.069 --> 01:38:12.987
I hope one day you learn
to solve a problem

01:38:12.988 --> 01:38:15.864
without sleeping with it.

01:38:15.865 --> 01:38:18.742
What happened between me and
Ben had nothing to do with you

01:38:18.743 --> 01:38:20.536
or my feelings for you.

01:38:20.537 --> 01:38:22.955
Oh, come on. You sell
all this nature shit

01:38:22.956 --> 01:38:25.165
and honesty and feelings,

01:38:25.166 --> 01:38:28.127
when you're just this empty little
girl with no responsibilities

01:38:28.128 --> 01:38:30.504
who gets anything
and everybody she wants

01:38:30.505 --> 01:38:32.631
because she's so goddamn pretty.

01:38:32.632 --> 01:38:34.800
And believe me, I know
what I'm talking about.

01:38:34.801 --> 01:38:37.886
I do the weather on TV.

01:38:37.887 --> 01:38:40.481
You got a week to get off my land.

I got that.

01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:37.322
Thanks.

01:39:39.324 --> 01:39:41.200

Sorry.

Buenos dias.

01:40:11.314 --> 01:40:13.607
- You wanted to see me?
- Wanted to see you?

01:40:13.608 --> 01:40:14.942
I was calling you...

01:40:14.943 --> 01:40:16.193
What is that?

01:40:16.194 --> 01:40:17.694
Last one in the case.

01:40:17.695 --> 01:40:19.154
You're out of luck.

01:40:19.155 --> 01:40:20.739
Ah, hell.

01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:22.825
I must have called you 100 times.

01:40:22.826 --> 01:40:25.994
- You never answered.
- I just thought you wanted to fire Delia.

01:40:25.995 --> 01:40:27.579
And obviously, I was right.

01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:29.498
Interesting thing about Delia.

01:40:29.499 --> 01:40:31.125
I ran it by corporate,

01:40:31.126 --> 01:40:32.835
and if she promises
to get a boob job,

01:40:32.836 --> 01:40:34.336
which she's on board with,

01:40:34.337 --> 01:40:36.213
she can do the weather.

God, I never thought
that was going to happen.

With Victoria getting married,

01:40:44.973 --> 01:40:46.890
there's an opening
on the anchor desk.

01:40:46.891 --> 01:40:49.434

someone who shows up,

after the last Storm Watch
