01:15.207 --> 01:17.374
Did you hear that?

01:17.376 --> 01:19.342
Well, I don't hear anything.

01:19.344 --> 01:21.044
Shut your fucking mouth.

01:21.046 --> 01:22.847
I definitely heard something.

01:43.602 --> 01:45.535
You should go check it out.

01:46.873 --> 01:49.639
Um, no, let's go.
I have a bad feeling.

01:49.641 --> 01:52.475
Come on. It's probably nothing.

01:52.477 --> 01:54.945
What are you talking about?
How could that be nothing?

01:54.947 --> 01:57.448
Why are you being such
a little bitch about this?

02:00.118 --> 02:03.020
- What?
- I'm sorry.

02:03.022 --> 02:05.389
I just heard
you were a fucking man.

02:47.265 --> 02:49.333
Anything?

02:49.335 --> 02:53.103
Uh... no.

03:05.450 --> 03:08.418
Fuck this.

03:29.574 --> 03:30.875
Aah!

03:30.877 --> 03:33.511
It worked!

03:35.981 --> 03:37.915
- Quick, do it while he's down.
- Yeah.

03:40.385 --> 03:42.987
Huh? It's not working.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.288
Fucking Amazon.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.858
Aaaah!

03:47.860 --> 03:49.359
I think he barely
even feels it.

03:49.361 --> 03:50.661
I got this.

04:13.552 --> 04:15.251
Ugh.

04:17.122 --> 04:21.024
- Do you want to cry for help?
- Go ahead, we'll wait.

04:21.026 --> 04:22.659
- Uh...
- Where's his I. D.?

04:24.062 --> 04:27.664
Lowell Orson Lehmann?

04:27.666 --> 04:29.332
- Lehmann.
- Good name for the news.

04:29.334 --> 04:31.935
Age 42, 6'6",
235 pounds.

04:31.937 --> 04:33.137
- Ooh.
- You realize this expires

04:33.139 --> 04:34.704
in, like, a month, right?

04:34.706 --> 04:38.341
You bitches made the stupidest
mistake of your lives.

04:38.343 --> 04:39.442
Ah! It speaks?

04:39.444 --> 04:41.945
I'm gonna cut your insides out.

04:45.117 --> 04:47.418
I'm gonna skull-fuck
your severed heads

04:47.420 --> 04:48.651
while your parents watch!

04:53.158 --> 04:56.327
You don't know
what I'm capable of.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.628
What?
Of course we know.

04:58.630 --> 05:00.197
We're your biggest fans, dude!

05:00.199 --> 05:01.865
Seen everything
you've ever done.

05:01.867 --> 05:03.666
Well, everything we know about.
We're pretty sure it's four.

05:03.668 --> 05:07.003
- Since last May, is that right?
- Five, plus Craig.

05:07.005 --> 05:10.039
Totes. You know, you can
follow us, if you want.

05:10.041 --> 05:12.909
It's @TragedyGirls.
That's two, plural.

05:12.911 --> 05:14.644
See this?

05:14.646 --> 05:16.079
You wouldn't believe
how relieved we were

05:16.081 --> 05:17.413
when you started
knocking off freshies.

05:17.415 --> 05:19.115
This town can be,
like, so boring.

05:19.117 --> 05:21.050
It took us a while
to figure out, but we did.

05:21.052 --> 05:23.152
How many weeks apart
before he strikes again?

05:23.154 --> 05:25.221
You really have a thing
for girls with short hair.

05:25.223 --> 05:27.558
Fortunately for everyone,
I look great in a pixie cut.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.892
She does.

05:28.894 --> 05:30.426
All it took was a few boys
to set the trap.

05:30.428 --> 05:32.529
Do you know how many handjobs
this girl had to give?

05:32.531 --> 05:33.764
Like 30.

05:33.766 --> 05:38.067
But you finally showed.
And you didn't disappoint.

05:38.069 --> 05:39.904
We are gonna have
so much fun together.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.807
Oh!

05:43.809 --> 05:46.776
Aaah!

05:49.548 --> 05:50.813
You smell that?

05:50.815 --> 05:53.082
That's your fucking
skin burning!

05:53.084 --> 05:55.952
Make no mistake
who's in charge, bitch.

05:55.954 --> 05:57.721
We're on the same side,
you know.

05:57.723 --> 05:59.255
We want the same things.

05:59.257 --> 06:01.257
We just don't <i>know</i> everything.

06:01.259 --> 06:04.428
- That's where you come in.
- We need a trainer.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.630
A teacher. Yoda.

06:06.632 --> 06:09.966
Now, McKayla here... she wasn't
really sold on the idea.

06:09.968 --> 06:11.368
Hmm. I had to be convinced.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.971
Luckily, I understand
the importance

06:13.973 --> 06:15.839
of a close student-teacher
relationship.

06:15.841 --> 06:18.074
And I bet you
are dying to impart

06:18.076 --> 06:19.276
a little of your experience

06:19.278 --> 06:20.711
on a few ambitious
up-and-comers.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.945
Am I right?

06:25.517 --> 06:27.517
- Gross.
- Hey!

06:27.519 --> 06:29.887
Bad Lowell! No!

06:29.889 --> 06:31.221
- No!
- We'll see how you feel

06:31.223 --> 06:33.690
after a few days
to think it over.

06:35.461 --> 06:36.993
What the shit?

06:36.995 --> 06:38.594
You've got to be kidding me.

06:38.596 --> 06:41.397
You couldn't even
do that right?

06:46.105 --> 06:48.105
Craig, bae.

06:50.408 --> 06:51.774
Ambulance.

06:51.776 --> 06:53.810
They're on their way.
Just hang in there.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.976
You're back down to four.

07:48.033 --> 07:49.399
Do you ever do this?

07:49.401 --> 07:51.368
The whole "industrial lye
to melt the body" thing?

07:51.370 --> 07:52.870
We stole it
from "Breaking Bad,"

07:52.872 --> 07:54.238
but it totally works.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.772
Yeah, it took a lot
of stray cats and dogs

07:55.774 --> 07:57.041
to get this mixture down.

08:00.178 --> 08:03.312
- Past his bedtime.
- On it!

08:03.314 --> 08:06.817
Stay the fuck away from me!
Oh!

08:16.461 --> 08:18.228
- She's got my vote.
- Really?

08:18.230 --> 08:20.130
- Just joking, bitch.
- Hey, guys! Who's left?

08:20.132 --> 08:21.432
Hey!

08:21.434 --> 08:22.598
Oh, they just cut
Rusty and Tina,

08:22.600 --> 08:24.735
so we're rooting
for Lucy and J.T.

08:24.737 --> 08:27.070
- How was prom planning?
- Really great.

08:27.072 --> 08:28.772
Sadie and I have
some really good ideas.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.940
Well, it's your senior year.
Enjoy it!

08:30.942 --> 08:32.275
I'll try.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.445
But I've got
a big day tomorrow, so bye.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.647
- Good night, sweetie!
- Night, baby!

08:39.284 --> 08:41.984
- Sorry I'm late.
- All good, kiddo.

08:41.986 --> 08:43.352
Thanks for the leftovers.

08:43.355 --> 08:45.722
- No problem.
- Did you take the truck out?

08:45.724 --> 08:47.925
Yeah. Grocery run.
And, yes, I filled the tank.

08:47.927 --> 08:50.359
That's my girl.

08:50.361 --> 08:53.229
- Night, pop.
- Night, kid.

08:53.231 --> 08:55.898
Hey! Have you seen
the cat lately?

08:55.900 --> 08:57.733
Nope. Sorry.

08:57.735 --> 08:59.670
Weird.

09:11.015 --> 09:13.483
We were gonna hang out, but
then he just stopped texting.

09:13.485 --> 09:15.252
Did you guys, like,
hear from him?

09:15.254 --> 09:16.652
It's been, like,
a really long time.

09:16.654 --> 09:19.522
- Because he was such a good guy.
- I know, right?

09:19.524 --> 09:21.691
I really hope nothing bad
happened to him.

09:21.693 --> 09:25.094
It's like... poof...
he vanished, right?

09:25.096 --> 09:26.662
I'm so scared right now.

09:26.664 --> 09:28.765
Death is just an inevitable
part of life, you know?

09:28.767 --> 09:30.400
Yeah, we have to,
like, treasure

09:30.402 --> 09:34.438
the time we have or whatever.

09:34.440 --> 09:38.275
It's, like, anybody
could be next, even you.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.143
You can find more information

09:40.145 --> 09:41.445
about the recent
unsolved murders

09:41.447 --> 09:42.879
on our Tragedy Girls
Twitter page.

09:42.881 --> 09:45.047
You know, if you want.

09:48.553 --> 09:52.388
I know, right?

09:52.390 --> 09:54.925
Okay, quiet down, everyone.
Quiet.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.493
Okay, before we get started,

09:56.495 --> 09:59.329
I think that we need to address
the elephant in the room.

09:59.331 --> 10:01.831
Craig is a model citizen
of this school.

10:01.833 --> 10:06.069
And if you need anyone
to talk to, I'm here.

10:06.071 --> 10:07.337
Okay?

10:07.339 --> 10:09.439
Oh.

10:11.543 --> 10:13.776
I'm gonna leave you
with the sheriff.

10:13.778 --> 10:15.481
Mrs. Kent.

10:17.216 --> 10:19.081
Now, I know there's been
a lot of speculation

10:19.083 --> 10:21.285
as to what happened.
And at this time,

10:21.287 --> 10:23.786
we firmly believe
Craig has run away from home.

10:23.788 --> 10:25.855
No!

10:25.857 --> 10:28.157
I mean...
how do you know?

10:28.159 --> 10:29.725
I'm not at liberty to say.

10:29.727 --> 10:31.627
So, there's no suspicion
of foul play?

10:31.629 --> 10:33.763
What about the recent string
of deaths in the tri-town area?

10:33.765 --> 10:35.666
Okay, girls, could we just
give it a rest, please?

10:35.668 --> 10:38.969
No, it's okay, Charlotte.
There's no need to panic,

10:38.971 --> 10:41.838
but if anyone has further
information about Craig,

10:41.840 --> 10:46.475
do not hesitate to come forward
so we can bring him home safe.

10:46.477 --> 10:47.710
Really?

10:47.712 --> 10:50.948
There's nothing else
you want to warn us about?

10:50.950 --> 10:53.382
No, Jordan.

10:53.384 --> 10:55.919
Not at this time.

10:55.921 --> 10:58.121
Mrs. Kent.

10:58.123 --> 11:00.757
Thanks, Sheriff.

11:00.759 --> 11:02.526
I know how easy it is
to spread rumors

11:02.528 --> 11:03.859
when you're in high school,

11:03.861 --> 11:06.863
but can we please try
and be respectful?

11:06.865 --> 11:08.433
That goes for everyone.

11:13.072 --> 11:16.373
The sheriff's office
is in full-on denial.

11:16.375 --> 11:19.642
But are they telling
the <i>full</i> truth?

11:19.644 --> 11:22.345
- How was that?
- Eh, I could go again.

11:22.347 --> 11:24.414
We need to emphasize
the Upworthy-ness.

11:24.416 --> 11:26.083
'Kay, one sec.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.020
I can't believe
everyone is so calm.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.656
I mean, there's a dangerous
killer on the loose...

11:32.658 --> 11:34.023
so to speak.

11:34.025 --> 11:36.026
Well, they jumped the gun
on bringing in Jordan's dad.

11:36.028 --> 11:40.363
There hasn't even been
a stake-raising second death.

11:40.365 --> 11:43.065
What's with you
and that mama's boy anyway?

11:43.067 --> 11:44.133
Nothing.

11:44.135 --> 11:46.203
We're sort of friends.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.871
Well, you don't need
any friends.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.307
- You have me.
- Aw, someone's jelly.

11:51.309 --> 11:52.709
I'm not jelly.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.877
He just has
a pathetic crush on you.

11:54.879 --> 11:57.414
Ever since he got held back
a year, he's been super-clingy.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.648
Put him out of his misery
already.

11:58.650 --> 12:00.584
Um, we need him
for the video editing?

12:00.586 --> 12:04.720
He's legit talented.
We only got one retweet today...

12:04.722 --> 12:06.189
from your mom.

12:06.191 --> 12:08.324
Sad.

12:08.326 --> 12:10.526
Fine. We'll step up our game.

12:12.530 --> 12:15.065
Now it's important
to distinguish

12:15.067 --> 12:18.768
what kind of killers
we're talking about here.

12:18.770 --> 12:21.037
Serial killers can operate
over many years

12:21.039 --> 12:23.507
and have very distinct patterns
when selecting their victims.

12:25.644 --> 12:28.978
While spree killers don't
have cooling-off periods,

12:28.980 --> 12:31.381
and kill like 2 or more people
in a short amount of time.

12:32.684 --> 12:34.685
- So it's like a Jeffrey Dahmer...
- Ugh.

12:34.687 --> 12:38.321
- Versus a Charles Starkweather...
- Hmm.

12:38.323 --> 12:41.157
But what kind of killer is
operating in Rosedale right now?

12:41.159 --> 12:43.426
And more importantly,
is he behind the disappearance

12:43.428 --> 12:44.927
of Craig Thompson?

12:44.929 --> 12:48.898
- And even more importantly...
- Who will be next?

12:50.936 --> 12:54.905
Yeah, so, I think my roto here
works pretty well.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.641
And, uh, you guys really sell it
with the performances.

12:57.643 --> 12:59.242
This is great, Jordan.

12:59.244 --> 13:01.744
Yeah, feel free
to stop whenever.

13:01.746 --> 13:03.379
You know, my dad says
there's no killer

13:03.381 --> 13:05.248
because he doesn't want
to scare people.

13:05.250 --> 13:08.352
But you guys want
to tell the truth,

13:08.354 --> 13:10.290
and so do I.

13:11.690 --> 13:14.324
Cool. So can you
just, like, upload it

13:14.326 --> 13:16.193
whenever it renders or whatever?

13:16.195 --> 13:17.828
Yeah. Okay.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.730
- Thanks, J.
- Oh, wait!

13:20.732 --> 13:25.835
Uh, this is yours.
"Martyrs" was just horrifying.

13:25.837 --> 13:28.438
So fucked up.
It's great, right?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.040
Yeah, yeah.
Um, you know,

13:30.042 --> 13:32.242
I've been getting into
more European stuff lately,

13:32.244 --> 13:33.944
if you ever want to...
come over.

13:33.946 --> 13:37.714
- We have cheer.
- Yeah. Sorry.

13:37.716 --> 13:39.549
Okay. Yeah. Cool. It's cool.

13:39.551 --> 13:42.618
Uh, maybe some other time,
if you ever want to...

13:42.620 --> 13:43.853
Great. So, I'll... I'll
just post this,

13:43.855 --> 13:46.956
once it's uh, uh,
once it's all good.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.960
Hashtag Tragedy Girls!

13:57.668 --> 14:00.270
We've got a comment
on our video already.

14:00.272 --> 14:03.172
"I made 8,000 dollars this week,
working from home."

14:03.174 --> 14:05.709
Fucking spambots.

14:05.711 --> 14:07.777
It's like nobody cares
what we're doing.

14:07.779 --> 14:09.278
I know.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.046
- Well, how's our new pet?
- Hmm.

14:13.085 --> 14:16.252
So boring.
It's like old drifter Periscope.

14:16.254 --> 14:18.988
I can't believe he's being
such a dick about helping us.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.456
He's like, "I'm gonna gut you
like a fish."

14:20.458 --> 14:22.158
Get over yourself, man.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.859
Well, that's it, I guess.
I don't know

14:23.861 --> 14:25.328
how we're gonna become
horror legends

14:25.330 --> 14:26.595
without an iconic killer.

14:26.597 --> 14:28.698
Dude, I told you,
we don't need him.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.435
Your brains, my charisma,
we can do anything.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.905
No offense, but last I checked,
that didn't work out so well.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.605
That was like a million
years ago.

14:36.607 --> 14:38.441
We could kill the juice-bar guy.

14:44.015 --> 14:46.315
Hi.

14:46.317 --> 14:47.950
He knows.

14:47.952 --> 14:50.753
Sometimes I just feel
like nothing I do matters.

14:50.755 --> 14:52.756
Like, I'm not special.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.757
Look, we're about to graduate
and go to college,

14:54.759 --> 14:56.792
and we haven't even started
our first killing spree.

14:56.794 --> 14:58.094
Is that what you want?

14:58.096 --> 15:00.497
Of course not.
But it's about the story.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.468
It's got to be legend-worthy.

15:03.499 --> 15:04.401
Something people
will never forget.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.602
Hmm.

15:08.173 --> 15:09.940
Wait.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.242
We just need 100,000 followers
by prom,

15:12.244 --> 15:13.542
and we'll be on our way.

15:13.544 --> 15:14.911
So we steal Lowell's
gross identity,

15:14.913 --> 15:16.680
and use it to leverage
our online presence.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.348
Then we frame him
for everything.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.249
Exactly. To the next phase.

15:20.251 --> 15:21.550
To the next phase.

15:21.552 --> 15:24.421
Be aggressive!
Be, be aggressive!

15:24.423 --> 15:27.257
Rosedale, Rosedale,
we're the best!

15:27.259 --> 15:31.895
Growing stronger than the rest!
Be aggressive!

15:31.897 --> 15:33.530
- Be, be aggressive!
- Be, be beheaded

15:33.532 --> 15:35.364
Whoo!

15:35.366 --> 15:36.932
- Whoo!
- Put your head down!

15:36.934 --> 15:38.868
- Why do we do this?
- Forget it.

15:38.870 --> 15:41.204
- Hi, ladies!
- Hi, Syl.

15:41.206 --> 15:43.138
What?

15:43.140 --> 15:46.376
- Super-cute shoes, McKayla.
- Thank you.

15:46.378 --> 15:47.776
But, as you know,

15:47.778 --> 15:49.512
we are supposed to have
the proper footwear

15:49.514 --> 15:51.414
for the pyramids
and the catching.

15:51.416 --> 15:53.083
So?

15:53.085 --> 15:55.685
So I just don't think
they're very practical.

15:55.687 --> 15:57.087
Don't get me wrong, I love them.

15:57.089 --> 16:00.223
But maybe you could just
sit this one out, okay?

16:00.225 --> 16:02.492
I just want everyone to be safe.

16:02.494 --> 16:04.460
Bye!

16:04.462 --> 16:05.896
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

16:05.898 --> 16:08.364
- What a cunt.
- Right?

16:08.366 --> 16:11.700
Rosedale High is trending.

16:11.702 --> 16:14.204
Hashtag RosedaleKiller
or hashtag PrayForCraig?

16:14.206 --> 16:15.638
Ugh. Neither.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.239
It's your leather jacket
of an ex-boyfriend.

16:17.241 --> 16:18.908
Oh.

16:18.910 --> 16:21.044
Jesus, are all of these pics
just him and his crotch rocket?

16:21.046 --> 16:24.180
- Yeah.
- And these song lyrics...

16:24.182 --> 16:25.714
He's so sensitive.

16:25.716 --> 16:27.584
He has so many more
followers than we do,

16:27.586 --> 16:29.319
and it's literally
the same thing!

16:29.321 --> 16:31.454
- What?!
- It's okay.

16:31.456 --> 16:34.590
You've really grown so much
in these last 12 hours.

16:34.592 --> 16:36.493
Be strong.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.460
Excuse me. Pardon me.

16:38.462 --> 16:40.729
Hey.

16:40.731 --> 16:42.065
What's up?

16:42.067 --> 16:45.001
Hi, Tobes.

16:45.003 --> 16:46.469
Hey, Kay-Kay.

16:46.471 --> 16:48.238
How are you doing?

16:48.240 --> 16:50.339
I'm good. Yeah, I'm good.
I'm just...

16:50.341 --> 16:52.975
I'm, like, really upset
about Craig and everything,

16:52.977 --> 16:54.511
- but...
- That's good.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.780
You need to be open right now
to experience everything.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.248
- I'm so open.
- As scary as it may be,

16:59.250 --> 17:02.819
you can't be afraid
to ride that wave.

17:02.821 --> 17:05.921
- I'm gonna ride it.
- No matter how terrifying it is.

17:05.923 --> 17:08.424
- Embrace it, okay?
- I'm gonna embrace it so hard.

17:10.362 --> 17:14.396
Yeah, so we happened to see
some of your posts about Craig.

17:14.397 --> 17:16.231
And they're really similar
to what we're doing.

17:16.233 --> 17:17.866
So we were just wondering
if maybe you could

17:17.867 --> 17:20.703
- give our blog a shout-out?
- Yeah, I don't...

17:20.704 --> 17:23.138
I don't think Toby
really does shout-outs.

17:23.141 --> 17:25.608
I don't know, I think
that a shout-out from me

17:25.611 --> 17:27.643
would be a little off-brand.

17:27.645 --> 17:29.045
Something is definitely
happening in Rosedale,

17:29.047 --> 17:31.280
and I think
that Craig would agree.

17:31.282 --> 17:34.417
Look, I say what I feel.

17:34.419 --> 17:38.587
If people connect with it,
then... that's beautiful.

17:40.659 --> 17:42.726
But I'm no hero.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.862
Just one post.
It'd really help us out.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.831
I miss you so much, Tobes.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.132
- I miss you too, Kay-kay.
- Really?

17:50.134 --> 17:52.201
I've been thinking a lot
about us lately.

17:52.203 --> 17:56.238
But everything that happened
with Craig is just so...

17:56.240 --> 17:58.040
so messed-up.

17:58.042 --> 18:00.009
You know?
All we have is each other,

18:00.011 --> 18:04.113
and I need to express myself
for the community.

18:04.115 --> 18:08.317
The whole community needs me
to be present for them.

18:08.319 --> 18:09.952
You understand?

18:09.954 --> 18:12.389
I have 15,000 followers.

18:15.227 --> 18:18.027
We so need to kill him.

18:18.029 --> 18:20.229
But why do we have to kill
the cute ones first?

18:20.231 --> 18:22.297
To make an omelet, you have
to kill some ex-boyfriends.

18:22.299 --> 18:24.968
Plus he's hella-annoying,
and he's distracting you.

18:24.970 --> 18:26.369
Yeah, but how do we do this?

18:26.371 --> 18:28.270
I mean, what are we
trying to say here?

18:28.272 --> 18:31.106
How about "I just stabbed your
basic bitch-ass in the throat

18:31.108 --> 18:32.709
'cause of your
emo status update."

18:32.711 --> 18:34.143
Be serious.

18:34.145 --> 18:35.745
Okay, you're the one
who's always saying

18:35.747 --> 18:38.248
that we have to have
a higher plan and shit.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.849
You're right. If we don't
put thought into this,

18:39.851 --> 18:41.316
we're no different

18:41.318 --> 18:42.719
than the Texas Chainsaw
reject we have tied up.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.720
He's always just trying
to escape.

18:44.722 --> 18:45.988
So boring.

18:45.990 --> 18:47.724
Why did you and Toby
break up, again?

18:47.726 --> 18:49.392
He said he needed
to find himself.

18:49.394 --> 18:52.461
But really he just found
a sick deal on a motorbike,

18:52.463 --> 18:54.463
which made him like 20% hotter.

18:54.465 --> 18:57.933
Wait. I could see it as
a "Death Proof" kind of thing.

18:57.935 --> 18:59.401
I can work with that.

18:59.403 --> 19:01.203
Yas, queen.

19:03.709 --> 19:07.509
Hey! Hey!

19:07.511 --> 19:12.315
- Yeah, yeah, like that.
- Making its way downtown.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.386
Ugh! Oh.

19:16.121 --> 19:18.121
Dinner time!

19:18.123 --> 19:19.622
Eat up, Lehmann.

19:19.624 --> 19:21.290
It's all good protein.

19:25.029 --> 19:28.698
We... look... amazing.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.499
- Hot, right?
- Yeah.

19:30.501 --> 19:33.169
But we're totally gonna have to
start wearing masks,

19:33.171 --> 19:35.371
'cause if we keep
dressing this good...

19:35.373 --> 19:38.540
people gonna know it's us.

19:38.542 --> 19:39.808
Let's talk Toby.

19:39.810 --> 19:42.178
Okay, so, he will be
at his house,

19:42.180 --> 19:44.980
working on his hog.
Sexy.

19:44.982 --> 19:48.517
Um, but, then he likes to go
for a ride on Connor Road

19:48.519 --> 19:51.019
to, like, think.

19:51.021 --> 19:53.189
Let's give him
something to think about.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.035
Hello?

20:06.037 --> 20:09.205
Hello?

20:09.207 --> 20:12.709
Who is this?

20:12.711 --> 20:16.112
Angela?

20:16.114 --> 20:18.782
Tatum?

20:18.784 --> 20:22.651
Michelle?

20:22.653 --> 20:24.787
McKayla?

20:38.369 --> 20:41.036
I was number 4?

20:41.038 --> 20:43.072
Proceeding with phase 2.

21:23.347 --> 21:25.347
Go around!

21:57.548 --> 21:59.649
Aaah!

22:00.885 --> 22:03.052
Aah!

22:04.923 --> 22:06.322
Aah! How'd it look?

22:06.324 --> 22:08.091
- Here you go.
- Ooh!

22:18.936 --> 22:21.069
Again?

22:21.071 --> 22:23.538
Motherfucker!

22:28.613 --> 22:30.078
Oh!

22:30.080 --> 22:32.715
Shut up.
Someone might hear you.

22:34.184 --> 22:36.652
More to the left.
His heart is more to the left.

22:36.654 --> 22:38.254
Ugh!

22:38.256 --> 22:40.189
Ugh!

22:40.191 --> 22:42.057
- You're just hitting bone, dude.
- I'm trying.

22:42.059 --> 22:44.393
Give it.

22:47.164 --> 22:49.097
Ugh!

22:52.037 --> 22:55.037
- Help! Help!
- Someone's coming.

22:55.039 --> 22:56.972
Help me!

22:56.974 --> 22:58.841
Shh!

23:01.112 --> 23:04.212
- Hey.
- Hey. Everything okay?

23:04.214 --> 23:06.915
Yeah.
Just a little car trouble.

23:06.917 --> 23:08.951
Oh.
Can I help out?

23:08.953 --> 23:10.420
That's all right.

23:10.422 --> 23:13.555
I know how to change a tire.

23:13.557 --> 23:15.290
- You sure?
- Yeah.

23:15.292 --> 23:16.959
Pretty good with my hands.

23:16.961 --> 23:19.261
And... And tires.

23:19.263 --> 23:22.899
Help!

23:22.901 --> 23:24.467
Shh.

23:24.469 --> 23:26.369
Uh, my friend is really
into Candy Crush.

23:26.371 --> 23:28.537
She hasn't scored a jelly in,
like, a hot minute, so...

23:28.539 --> 23:30.773
- Oh. Okay, I know how that is.
- Yeah.

23:40.285 --> 23:45.520
If I'm gonna be murdered,
I'm so happy it's you.

24:09.346 --> 24:10.947
M-Kay!

24:10.949 --> 24:13.882
What the fuck?

24:13.884 --> 24:15.551
Nothing.

24:15.553 --> 24:19.455
Got him.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.024
Ugh. Okay.

24:21.026 --> 24:22.959
- You ready to rehearse this?
- Yeah.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.128
So, we were just driving
down the street

24:25.130 --> 24:26.863
after our morning workout,
obviously.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.564
And there was this body there.

24:28.566 --> 24:31.667
And I'm not a CSI person, but
it looked like he was murdered.

24:31.669 --> 24:33.302
Okay.

24:36.307 --> 24:38.240
I'm not a CSI person,

24:38.242 --> 24:39.875
but it looked like
he was murdered.

24:39.877 --> 24:43.345
Murdered? The coroner's report
says it was an accident.

24:43.347 --> 24:45.715
- So devastating.
- But wasn't there evidence

24:45.717 --> 24:47.315
that he was stabbed
multiple times?

24:47.317 --> 24:49.151
That's just what we heard.

24:49.153 --> 24:51.653
You can watch the video on our
YouTube channel, Tragedy Girls.

24:51.655 --> 24:53.488
Girls, plural. We have
a Twitter and a Tumblr.

24:53.490 --> 24:55.357
Look, girls,
points for enthusiasm,

24:55.359 --> 24:57.626
but please let the professionals
handle this, okay?

24:57.628 --> 24:58.861
Just one interview.

24:58.863 --> 25:00.630
I mean, we can say
whatever you want us to say.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.131
We'll post a link
on our website.

25:02.133 --> 25:03.565
We can help each other out.

25:03.567 --> 25:06.436
Real journalism is based
in facts, not hashtags.

25:06.438 --> 25:07.969
Why are you even here?

25:07.971 --> 25:10.405
Young people and road safety.
That's the real story.

25:10.407 --> 25:12.141
Now, if you'll excuse me,
please.

25:12.143 --> 25:14.076
Can we get the shots
of the cars parking?

25:14.078 --> 25:15.444
- Please, like, right now?
- Sure.

25:15.446 --> 25:18.613
Parked cars.
They're not going anywhere.

25:18.615 --> 25:21.383
I tried to show my dad
your page, but he won't budge.

25:21.385 --> 25:23.652
He just said,
"Motorbikes are dangerous."

25:23.654 --> 25:26.021
Okay, well, maybe we can
use this to our advantage?

25:26.023 --> 25:28.857
Make a "Rosedale Murder
Cover-Up" video?

25:28.859 --> 25:31.094
He also said I probably
shouldn't be making movies

25:31.096 --> 25:32.929
with you guys anymore.

25:32.931 --> 25:37.467
- And what did you say?
- Told him to fuck off.

25:37.469 --> 25:40.169
Not using those exact words,
but you know,

25:40.171 --> 25:41.770
I think we left things
ambiguous enough

25:41.772 --> 25:43.905
that he probably knows
what I'm gonna do.

25:43.907 --> 25:46.241
But, guys, if there's some
sort of psycho on the loose,

25:46.243 --> 25:47.410
you need to leave it alone.

25:47.412 --> 25:49.077
Don't be lame,
we're not scared.

25:49.079 --> 25:51.581
No, I'm serious.
I...

25:51.583 --> 25:54.616
Look, I just don't want see...
anybody get hurt.

25:56.887 --> 25:59.087
Well, I promise we'll stop

25:59.089 --> 26:00.957
if I ever feel like
we're in danger.

26:00.959 --> 26:02.959
Okay?

26:02.961 --> 26:04.462
Okay.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.131
Well, we're late
for Prom Committee.

26:08.133 --> 26:09.532
But, hey, Jordan,

26:09.534 --> 26:11.566
maybe you should find
a date to prom, you know,

26:11.568 --> 26:14.036
'cause it's gonna be fun
and you don't want to go alone.

26:14.038 --> 26:15.872
Because that's
extremely pathetic.

26:17.174 --> 26:19.475
Maybe your daddy
can help you find someone.

26:29.287 --> 26:31.386
Je-scuse moi?

26:31.388 --> 26:33.855
Could you repeat that, Syl?
For the record?

26:33.857 --> 26:37.125
Yes. Like I was saying, two of
our fellow classmates are gone,

26:37.127 --> 26:39.594
and I think, to honor them,
we should tone down the dance.

26:39.596 --> 26:41.863
It is so tragic we lost Craig
before his time...

26:41.865 --> 26:45.468
And my ex, Toby.
May he rest in peace.

26:45.470 --> 26:48.938
As a junior, you may not
quite understand this yet, Syl,

26:48.940 --> 26:52.107
but I think it would actually
dishonor their memory.

26:52.109 --> 26:55.478
Yeah, if we don't have prom,
then the haters win, Syl.

26:55.480 --> 26:58.381
Plus, we already made
the deposit on the deejay.

26:58.383 --> 26:59.915
And that shit's nonrefundable.

26:59.917 --> 27:01.883
I hear you, but that was
before everything happened.

27:01.885 --> 27:04.253
I think we should donate
our budget to the families.

27:04.255 --> 27:05.488
Right?

27:09.661 --> 27:11.294
Goodness.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.830
Order! Syl makes, like,
some really good points,

27:14.832 --> 27:18.366
but I think we should
celebrate how they lived.

27:18.368 --> 27:19.768
Well, I think
we should vote on it.

27:19.770 --> 27:22.238
And I'd like to be
the first to motion this.

27:24.776 --> 27:27.375
- Seconded?
- Mm-hmm.

27:27.377 --> 27:29.911
Well, let the record show

27:29.913 --> 27:32.180
that both the president
and the vice president

27:32.182 --> 27:34.650
are vehemently
opposed to this change.

27:34.652 --> 27:36.852
- Vehemently!
- Well, I would just like

27:36.854 --> 27:39.020
to thank you all for coming,
and I just really hope

27:39.022 --> 27:41.457
that we can all
band together as a class

27:41.459 --> 27:43.926
and really respect each other
and bring together...

27:49.000 --> 27:52.767
- What the hell is that?
- Syl made it. It's a library.

27:52.769 --> 27:54.469
A library for what?

27:54.471 --> 27:56.305
People make these and put them
in front of their houses

27:56.307 --> 27:57.606
with used copies of "Twilight,"

27:57.608 --> 27:59.408
and old people
borrow books from them.

27:59.410 --> 28:00.843
It's a thing.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.278
How did that prissy bitch
get so good at woodshop?

28:03.280 --> 28:04.880
"I really hope
that my work can inspire

28:04.882 --> 28:06.382
free little libraries
everywhere,

28:06.384 --> 28:08.150
and really do some good.
You know?"

28:08.152 --> 28:10.318
And it's going to the state
competition this weekend

28:10.320 --> 28:13.889
as Rosedale's official entry.

28:13.891 --> 28:15.591
Not anymore.

28:17.929 --> 28:20.830
So, if I move my shift
at the shelter,

28:20.832 --> 28:22.163
that would clear up
the afternoon

28:22.165 --> 28:23.966
to go to the old folks' home.

28:23.968 --> 28:25.934
- Right?
- Okay.

28:32.410 --> 28:35.678
Who did this?

28:35.680 --> 28:40.449
How am I supposed to get my
lending-library scholarship now?

28:40.451 --> 28:42.951
Don't just stand there, help me!

28:42.953 --> 28:46.122
How could you let this happen?
You get every piece.

28:53.998 --> 28:57.999
No matter how hard I work,
it'll never be the same.

29:02.272 --> 29:04.373
Oh... my God.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.875
You are ruining it!
Just... Just get out.

29:06.877 --> 29:09.711
Okay? Go, go, go, go.
We're leaving.

29:09.713 --> 29:11.279
Thank you.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.441
Goodnight, Mr. Gordon.

29:39.443 --> 29:41.744
Night, uh, you.

29:52.423 --> 29:54.422
Hello?

29:54.424 --> 29:56.861
I'm still working in here.

29:58.962 --> 30:00.629
People.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.199
I said I'm still in here!

30:04.201 --> 30:06.201
Look, Mr. Wan said that I could!

30:30.528 --> 30:33.863
You have got to be kidding me.

30:47.310 --> 30:48.710
Jesus, you scared me.

30:48.712 --> 30:51.881
Sorry, I thought I was
the only one in here.

30:51.883 --> 30:54.083
Did your Drama Club run late?

30:57.954 --> 30:59.755
Okay, can I help you?

30:59.757 --> 31:03.191
I'm kind of
working on something.

31:03.193 --> 31:04.959
Okay.

31:07.164 --> 31:09.832
Okay, what is this?

31:12.537 --> 31:14.603
Uh, Mr. Gordon?!

31:14.605 --> 31:16.971
Anyone? No?

31:19.042 --> 31:21.876
- McKayla?
- Shit.

31:21.878 --> 31:24.947
- Damn it, M-Kay!
- I'm sorry.

31:24.949 --> 31:26.748
Not really feeling this
whole pantomime thing anyway.

31:26.750 --> 31:29.151
- Stay in character!
- Ugh.

31:35.292 --> 31:37.293
Oh!

31:37.295 --> 31:40.796
Oh!

31:43.034 --> 31:44.799
Aah!

31:44.801 --> 31:46.568
Oh! Aah!

31:46.570 --> 31:50.271
Aah! Aaaah!

31:59.115 --> 32:00.982
Did that just...

32:00.984 --> 32:02.617
I can't even...

32:02.619 --> 32:05.153
That is some serious
"Final Destination" shit.

32:05.155 --> 32:06.721
Damn it.

32:06.723 --> 32:09.491
This is still gonna
look like an accident, again!

32:09.493 --> 32:11.896
What do we do?

32:19.604 --> 32:21.370
Ugh. Like this?

32:22.940 --> 32:25.373
Yeah, just so there's
no possible way

32:25.375 --> 32:27.375
she could have
done this herself.

32:35.486 --> 32:37.419
Check it out.

32:37.421 --> 32:39.455
"Your shoes are not regulation."

33:54.932 --> 33:57.199
McKayla... just a few words.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.500
How does it feel to see your
conspiracy theory come to life?

33:59.502 --> 34:01.069
Honestly, I'm not surprised.

34:01.071 --> 34:02.837
You know, I've been the voice
of reason in Rosedale...

34:02.839 --> 34:04.238
- I'm sorry, you can't do this.
- Excuse me,

34:04.240 --> 34:05.708
- we're doing an interview.
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.008
- This is not allowed.
- I was doing...

34:07.010 --> 34:09.143
But I look really cute today.

34:09.146 --> 34:11.280
Can I get a picture with you
by your locker?

34:11.282 --> 34:12.880
- That would really help me out.
- Yeah.

34:12.882 --> 34:15.818
Thanks.

34:15.820 --> 34:19.722
Hey. Uh, you guys need
to take it down a notch.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.789
Why? We're finally getting

34:21.791 --> 34:23.757
the recognition
that we deserve

34:23.760 --> 34:26.161
on this very important
public-safety issue...

34:26.163 --> 34:27.195
or whatever.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.764
- Whoa, what happened there?
- Nothing.

34:29.766 --> 34:33.333
- Is that blood?
- Heavy-flow day.

34:33.335 --> 34:36.204
I don't know. That's not
how that works, right?

34:36.206 --> 34:38.306
Sadie Cunningham
and McKayla Hooper

34:38.309 --> 34:40.175
to the principal's office
immediately.

34:40.177 --> 34:41.376
Sadie and McKayla.

34:41.378 --> 34:43.679
Okay, my dad is really
pissed at you guys.

34:43.681 --> 34:44.813
Why?

34:44.815 --> 34:47.047
He wants to bring you in...

34:47.050 --> 34:48.983
for interfering
with an investigation.

34:48.985 --> 34:52.521
- Shut up! Really?
- Okay, well, um...

34:52.523 --> 34:55.123
if... if Sadie needs, like,
an alibi or something,

34:55.126 --> 34:57.059
just to get her out of a jam,
just tell her...

34:57.061 --> 34:58.394
She can say she was with me

34:58.396 --> 35:00.695
watching some
Dario Argento movie, okay?

35:00.697 --> 35:04.800
- Dario DiGiorno.
- Dario Argento.

35:04.802 --> 35:08.103
Dario Arpeggio. Mario Wario.

35:08.105 --> 35:13.909
I don't know. I don't care.
Bye-sies!

35:13.911 --> 35:16.378
- Hey, can I?
- Obviously.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.146
Hmm.

35:20.684 --> 35:22.251
Now, I want to assure you both

35:22.253 --> 35:25.787
that no one here is
accusing you girls of anything.

35:25.789 --> 35:27.990
- We were just trying to help.
- But if you guys

35:27.992 --> 35:29.724
would just admit
that something's going on...

35:29.726 --> 35:31.659
I don't need advice
from teenagers

35:31.661 --> 35:34.128
on how to protect
this community.

35:34.130 --> 35:37.700
Okay, no one here
is the bad guy.

35:37.702 --> 35:39.534
If there is a perpetrator,

35:39.536 --> 35:42.871
you're not helping to catch him,
you're encouraging him.

35:42.873 --> 35:44.673
So, you're saying
there's a perpetrator?

35:44.675 --> 35:46.407
Does he text you
when you're next?

35:46.409 --> 35:50.211
Do you have any idea what that
girl's family is going through?

35:50.213 --> 35:53.981
Yes, we've been in contact
with them through our blog.

35:53.983 --> 35:56.284
They only want justice
for their daughter.

35:56.286 --> 35:59.454
We were on Prom Committee
and on Cheer Squad together.

35:59.456 --> 36:02.657
They asked us both to speak
at her memorial service.

36:02.659 --> 36:05.293
We all need to find
a way to grieve.

36:05.295 --> 36:09.498
And remembering Syl's spirit
on the Internet is part of that.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.166
Thank you for your time, girls.

36:11.168 --> 36:12.700
Thank you.

36:12.702 --> 36:17.673
I need you both to account
for your whereabouts last night.

36:17.675 --> 36:20.476
- I was with Sadie.
- Watching a movie.

36:20.478 --> 36:21.809
With Jordan Welch.

36:28.452 --> 36:31.019
This is un-fucking
acceptable, Gerald.

36:31.021 --> 36:33.956
They're jeopardizing
the whole investigation.

36:33.958 --> 36:36.791
Well, if you want to police
these kids on Twitter,

36:36.793 --> 36:39.394
be my guest.

37:09.059 --> 37:11.059
And a big thanks
to Jordan Welch

37:11.061 --> 37:13.427
for putting that together
under such short notice.

37:13.429 --> 37:15.831
Jordan.

37:19.603 --> 37:21.369
She will be missed.

37:21.371 --> 37:25.840
Also, I hope that I can fill
her shoes as cheer captain.

37:25.842 --> 37:27.208
For more information,
or to donate

37:27.210 --> 37:28.476
to a charity in Syl's name,

37:28.478 --> 37:31.012
you can visit our blog
at Tragedy Girls...

37:31.014 --> 37:33.514
I got something to say.

37:33.516 --> 37:35.983
Um...

37:35.985 --> 37:37.853
Big Al, everyone.

37:41.592 --> 37:44.358
Thank you, ladies.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.862
You all know me.

37:46.864 --> 37:48.963
I've been a firefighter
in this community

37:48.965 --> 37:50.566
for eight years,

37:50.568 --> 37:52.166
fire marshal for two,

37:52.168 --> 37:54.403
not to mention going to state
handball championships

37:54.405 --> 37:57.873
three years running,
right here in this very gym.

37:57.875 --> 38:01.242
87-39...
record still stands.

38:01.244 --> 38:03.744
I know what's happening
in this town.

38:03.746 --> 38:05.546
And these girls are right.

38:05.548 --> 38:07.682
Someone is targeting our kids!

38:07.684 --> 38:10.818
And the sheriff's department
is not doing enough about it.

38:10.820 --> 38:14.889
We have to stand up
for our community

38:14.891 --> 38:16.557
and find who's responsible.

38:16.559 --> 38:19.494
If that means myself
and some volunteers

38:19.496 --> 38:22.331
are searching every block,
every abandoned property

38:22.333 --> 38:24.900
to find the guy
that's out there doing this,

38:24.902 --> 38:26.901
we will,
and that's a promise!

38:26.903 --> 38:28.804
That's what I'm talking
about, Big Al!

38:37.681 --> 38:40.382
Can you believe he just stole
the mic from us like that?

38:40.384 --> 38:42.050
I know, right?

38:42.052 --> 38:44.452
Dick. So hot, though.

38:44.454 --> 38:45.887
So hot.

38:45.889 --> 38:49.057
My, uh, smoke alarm
is broken again.

38:49.059 --> 38:50.892
That's very dangerous,
Mrs. Kent.

38:50.894 --> 38:53.028
Mm-hmm.

38:56.300 --> 38:59.367
Not too much,
or he might smell it.

38:59.369 --> 39:02.070
Shit!

39:02.072 --> 39:05.240
- Watch out, M-Kay!
- Why do we have to do this?

39:05.242 --> 39:06.842
Why can't we just hit him
with an ax or something?

39:06.844 --> 39:09.878
Because he's huge, and he's
probably expecting someone

39:09.880 --> 39:11.345
to attack him.

39:11.347 --> 39:13.617
We've got another bottle
in the car.

39:16.152 --> 39:18.452
She's not like you.

39:18.454 --> 39:21.990
Whatever, Hannibal.

39:21.992 --> 39:25.059
She makes little plans.

39:25.061 --> 39:28.496
Always bossing you around.

39:28.498 --> 39:32.400
Now you, you...
you're more like me.

39:34.103 --> 39:36.905
What the fuck
are you talking about?

39:36.907 --> 39:39.775
Ask yourself...

39:39.777 --> 39:42.978
who really takes all the risk?

39:42.980 --> 39:46.615
Who really wants the kill?

39:46.617 --> 39:48.249
Hmm?

39:48.251 --> 39:51.153
No, without you,
she's, um, nothing.

39:53.090 --> 39:55.824
No, Sadie and I are like
the same person.

39:55.826 --> 39:58.793
She orders you around.

39:58.795 --> 40:00.295
Not always.

40:00.297 --> 40:04.166
She'll take all the credit,
you know,

40:04.168 --> 40:08.836
just like the desperate
little fan girl that she is.

40:08.838 --> 40:10.706
You can't trust her.

40:13.110 --> 40:16.711
- What am I supposed to do?
- Just release me,

40:16.713 --> 40:21.316
and we'll kill everybody
that gets in our way.

40:29.092 --> 40:32.394
It's okay.

40:32.396 --> 40:36.401
Just... Just open the door,
McKayla.

40:37.967 --> 40:40.101
Okay.

40:45.842 --> 40:47.775
Oh, my God, Lowell.

40:47.777 --> 40:49.711
This is kind of sad, bro.

40:49.713 --> 40:53.548
Like you could ever get
in between me and my BFF.

40:53.550 --> 40:55.684
You know I'm right.

40:55.686 --> 40:57.452
Before this is over,

40:57.454 --> 40:59.987
she'll betray you.

41:07.463 --> 41:11.465
Oh, Big Al, you're so big!

41:11.467 --> 41:12.967
Thank you, Mrs. Kent.

41:12.969 --> 41:15.503
I just love
your big, meaty hands!

41:15.505 --> 41:18.173
Is that what she sounds like?

41:18.175 --> 41:19.608
I don't know.

41:19.610 --> 41:21.976
I feel like
she would be like, "Ooh!"

41:21.978 --> 41:23.478
I feel like her laugh
is like a "hoo."

41:23.480 --> 41:25.414
Like a "hoo-hoo-hoo hoo hoo!"

41:34.358 --> 41:36.157
Hi.

41:38.429 --> 41:40.561
Keep in touch
with the fire station,

41:40.563 --> 41:42.930
I don't want a bunch of those
"heroes" forming a mob.

41:42.932 --> 41:47.202
- Sheriff, uh, you got a minute?
- Make it quick, son.

41:47.204 --> 41:48.903
Look, I know that
you don't like them,

41:48.905 --> 41:51.606
but Sadie and McKayla have found
some really good patterns...

41:51.608 --> 41:53.041
Not this again.

41:53.043 --> 41:55.376
Can you at least
take a look at it?

41:55.378 --> 41:57.579
Because of their bullshit,
I'm working 'round the clock

41:57.581 --> 41:59.981
to keep this town
from going crazy.

41:59.983 --> 42:02.117
Go home.

42:02.119 --> 42:03.952
Can we talk?

42:10.193 --> 42:12.293
Okay, look, I've been
editing their blog

42:12.295 --> 42:13.695
for a couple weeks now,
and I feel like,

42:13.697 --> 42:15.664
if you just took a look
at it once, then...

42:15.666 --> 42:19.367
Jordan, I think about
your mom every day.

42:19.369 --> 42:21.635
But this is not the same.

42:21.637 --> 42:24.106
Finding this guy
does not bring her back.

42:24.108 --> 42:25.807
And you running around,
spreading lies

42:25.809 --> 42:29.677
with that Cunningham girl
does not honor her memory.

42:29.679 --> 42:31.545
Understand?

42:31.547 --> 42:33.815
I just want you
to listen to me.

42:37.320 --> 42:38.887
We're not done here.

42:55.905 --> 42:58.472
Dude, finish strong!
Finish strong! One more!

42:58.474 --> 43:01.041
Yeah!

43:01.043 --> 43:03.644
Whoo! Good job, boy!

43:03.646 --> 43:05.079
- Aw.
- Yeah!

43:05.081 --> 43:06.780
Come on.

43:06.782 --> 43:09.851
Damn, you've been really
working out, huh?

43:09.853 --> 43:11.686
Good job, good job, man.
You're good to cut the lights

43:11.688 --> 43:13.088
and lock the door
when I get out, right?

43:13.090 --> 43:14.222
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right, cool.

43:14.224 --> 43:15.523
Let me get ya,
let me get ya.

43:15.525 --> 43:16.758
All right.
Thanks, Drew.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.360
No problem.

43:18.362 --> 43:20.028
Whoo, Big Al!

43:25.735 --> 43:27.501
Perfect.

43:27.503 --> 43:29.604
Okay, so remember
the safe word is "torso."

43:29.606 --> 43:32.039
Dude, I know. You told me
like a million times.

43:44.554 --> 43:47.188
Oof.

43:47.190 --> 43:48.856
Oof.

43:52.329 --> 43:54.429
Nice one!

43:54.431 --> 43:57.666
But you should use
the other mirror.

43:57.668 --> 43:59.633
It's got, like,
way better lighting.

43:59.635 --> 44:02.737
Hey, um, I think
they're closed.

44:02.739 --> 44:04.371
Yeah, I know, I just saw
what's-his-name

44:04.373 --> 44:06.374
and he was like,
"You can get in a quick 30."

44:06.376 --> 44:07.909
Pump some iron,
as long as I've got

44:07.911 --> 44:11.780
this big strong muscle-y Al
to take care of me!

44:11.782 --> 44:13.981
Yeah, well,
I'm just finishing up, so...

44:13.983 --> 44:16.383
Yeah, no, that's fine.
I'm just gonna, um,

44:16.385 --> 44:18.920
I'm just gonna do
a couple, like, sets.

44:18.922 --> 44:21.889
You know what I mean?
Like, for my body.

44:21.891 --> 44:25.659
I've never seen you
in here before.

44:25.661 --> 44:28.729
You know what, I was thinking,
like, the same thing.

44:28.731 --> 44:30.465
I was like, "Wow,
it's weird," right?

44:30.467 --> 44:31.800
Like, I'm here all the time.

44:31.802 --> 44:34.903
I mean, like, so are you,
obviously.

44:34.905 --> 44:36.737
Oh, I'm such a klutz.

44:36.739 --> 44:38.206
Oh, hey,
don't worry about that.

44:38.208 --> 44:39.441
No, no, no,
let me refill it for you.

44:39.443 --> 44:41.008
No, really,
I'm about to leave...

44:41.010 --> 44:43.043
I insist.

44:57.728 --> 45:00.095
Big bottle.

45:09.206 --> 45:10.972
Shit.

45:10.974 --> 45:12.740
Here you go.

45:12.742 --> 45:14.976
Thank you.
You didn't have to do that.

45:14.978 --> 45:16.443
Yeah.

45:16.445 --> 45:20.581
Um, so, do you have any,
I don't know, like, tips...

45:20.583 --> 45:24.385
for a girl who's trying to...
tighten?

45:24.387 --> 45:25.854
Tighten up.
Well, for your build,

45:25.856 --> 45:27.988
you might want to start
with more free weights.

45:27.990 --> 45:30.791
Free weights. Cool.
Yeah, no, good. Good idea. Ooh.

45:30.793 --> 45:34.431
- How about that?
- Hmm.

45:36.199 --> 45:39.266
Mmm. Water. Mmm.

45:39.268 --> 45:43.003
Ah! So refreshing. Mmm.

45:43.005 --> 45:44.972
Mmm.

45:47.744 --> 45:50.612
You okay?

45:50.614 --> 45:53.180
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

45:53.182 --> 45:54.816
Someone's here.

45:54.818 --> 45:56.950
- I didn't hear anything.
- I did.

45:56.952 --> 46:00.454
- Maybe we should hydrate. Oh.
- Stay here.

46:00.456 --> 46:02.222
Do you want to
take this with you?

46:02.224 --> 46:04.025
Somebody back here?

46:27.384 --> 46:29.818
What are you doing?

46:32.456 --> 46:34.555
Sorry about that.
Can't be too careful,

46:34.557 --> 46:36.590
especially with a nut-job
on the loose.

46:36.592 --> 46:39.596
No worries.

46:43.532 --> 46:45.367
So, you want me to spot you?

46:47.103 --> 46:48.369
What the hell?

46:48.371 --> 46:50.003
Dude! I said I got this!

46:50.005 --> 46:53.240
Sorry! Torso! Torso!

46:53.242 --> 46:54.742
Ugh!

46:54.744 --> 46:56.543
Call the police!

46:59.449 --> 47:03.184
You bitches crazy!

48:10.052 --> 48:13.220
Well, at least this won't
look like an accident.

48:13.222 --> 48:15.389
Dude.
I totally had it.

48:15.391 --> 48:17.291
He drank the water
and everything.

48:17.293 --> 48:19.260
Jordan's on his way to my
house, like, right now.

48:19.262 --> 48:20.728
- We need to go.
- Okay, fine,

48:20.730 --> 48:22.563
but you're not hearing
the last of this, okay?

48:22.565 --> 48:24.499
I've got a lot
to talk to you about.

48:24.501 --> 48:26.034
You always have a lot
to talk to me about.

48:26.036 --> 48:28.101
I've got notes, girl.
I've got notes.

48:56.599 --> 48:58.768
Hey J. What's up?

49:00.971 --> 49:03.170
My dad left his work
computer logged in,

49:03.172 --> 49:07.441
so I copied the police reports,
crime-scene photos,

49:07.443 --> 49:10.278
and documents
from all six murders.

49:10.280 --> 49:14.949
- This is amazing.
- Yeah. It's, uh, super-illegal.

49:14.951 --> 49:16.117
So...

49:16.119 --> 49:18.289
You did this for me?

49:18.989 --> 49:22.789
- Your dad would, like, freak out.
- Don't worry about him.

49:22.791 --> 49:24.559
Look, I know
telling you to let it go

49:24.561 --> 49:26.260
only seems to spur you on...

49:26.262 --> 49:29.396
so, uh, fuck it.

49:29.398 --> 49:31.199
I'm all in.

49:33.003 --> 49:35.068
You're such a good friend, J.

49:39.175 --> 49:41.575
Whoa, look at that
splatter pattern.

49:41.577 --> 49:43.845
- Yeah. That's...
- How awesome is that?

49:43.847 --> 49:47.282
Yeah. It's really...
It's really great.

49:47.284 --> 49:48.782
- That's crazy.
- We can...

49:48.784 --> 49:52.186
We can turn this off anytime.
Anytime we want, really.

49:52.188 --> 49:53.287
I like them.

50:28.023 --> 50:30.325
Come in.

50:30.327 --> 50:32.092
Hey, sunshine.

50:32.094 --> 50:34.963
Oh, you shouldn't have
let me sleep in.

50:34.965 --> 50:38.432
I have to be ready for school.

50:38.434 --> 50:40.168
School's canceled today, hon.

50:40.170 --> 50:41.936
Look, I don't know
how to say this,

50:41.938 --> 50:44.738
so I'm just gonna say it.

50:44.740 --> 50:47.110
There's been another murder.

50:49.112 --> 50:50.612
What?!

50:54.050 --> 50:55.782
The body of
decorated firefighter

50:55.784 --> 50:57.818
Albert "Big Al" Hill
was discovered

50:57.820 --> 51:01.222
earlier this morning
by his longtime trainer.

51:01.224 --> 51:03.891
Your friend of 20 years
found brutally murdered

51:03.893 --> 51:06.760
in the one place that you
were supposed to feel safe.

51:06.762 --> 51:08.996
Will you ever look
at the gym the same?

51:08.998 --> 51:11.365
There's a hole in my heart
where Al used to live.

51:11.367 --> 51:13.333
- Honey?
- Yeah.

51:13.335 --> 51:16.670
- Another murder! Town meeting.
- Okay.

51:16.672 --> 51:18.840
We have to find a way
to remember Al.

51:18.842 --> 51:21.943
We have to find a way
to remember Al!

51:21.945 --> 51:24.278
We at Channel 5 remember Al,

51:24.280 --> 51:26.347
and we are asking you,
if we don't start yielding

51:26.349 --> 51:29.182
to the warning signs
of our local hero,

51:29.184 --> 51:31.719
who will be next?
Back to you.

51:31.721 --> 51:34.354
He had gotten so strong.
So strong.

51:34.356 --> 51:35.956
Are we still live?

51:35.958 --> 51:37.925
You know, Big Al was
the toughest S.O.B. I ever met.

51:37.927 --> 51:40.561
Cracked my tooth once
playing handball.

51:40.563 --> 51:41.963
- Steven...
- I'm just saying,

51:41.965 --> 51:43.898
the guy was kind of a hot head.

51:43.900 --> 51:45.900
Really surprised they
made him fire marshal.

51:45.902 --> 51:47.668
Well, there's an emergency
town-hall meeting

51:47.670 --> 51:49.302
this afternoon.
Now, baby,

51:49.304 --> 51:51.238
you don't have to go
if you don't want to.

51:51.240 --> 51:55.376
I, um, I'm still trying
to process this.

51:55.378 --> 51:57.311
But I think I'll be there.

51:57.313 --> 52:00.581
McKayla, I do not want you out
by yourself at night anymore.

52:00.583 --> 52:01.782
It's too dangerous.

52:01.784 --> 52:03.351
But I still have
Prom Committee.

52:03.353 --> 52:04.985
I won't go
anywhere without Sadie.

52:04.987 --> 52:07.454
We'll keep each other safe.

52:07.456 --> 52:08.822
Please?

52:08.824 --> 52:10.724
But I want
regular text updates.

52:10.726 --> 52:12.392
Yes.

52:12.394 --> 52:13.728
That's my girl.

52:13.730 --> 52:16.130
Waffle me.

52:16.132 --> 52:18.199
Thank you, baby.

52:25.974 --> 52:29.443
Please, please.
Can I have your attention?

52:29.445 --> 52:32.746
Our town, our community,

52:32.748 --> 52:36.284
our entire way of life
is under attack.

52:36.286 --> 52:40.088
We will overcome this,
but we must have faith.

52:40.090 --> 52:43.490
We must have patience
with our law enforcement

52:43.492 --> 52:45.059
and with each other.

52:45.061 --> 52:49.063
This is a time for remembering,
for mourning.

52:49.065 --> 52:50.965
And now I'd like
to turn the floor over

52:50.967 --> 52:53.900
to Sheriff Welch, if you please.

52:53.902 --> 52:56.037
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

52:56.039 --> 52:57.972
I'd like to stress to everybody

52:57.974 --> 53:01.141
that the most important
thing to do is stay calm

53:01.143 --> 53:04.345
and not make our community
even more vulnerable.

53:04.347 --> 53:07.615
I've consulted with
the state police and the FBI.

53:07.617 --> 53:09.217
And with their help,

53:09.219 --> 53:11.952
a strict curfew of 8:00 p.m.
will be in effect.

53:22.931 --> 53:24.999
Son of a bitch!

53:27.070 --> 53:31.572
- Please, remain calm.
- Curfews can't keep us safe!

53:31.574 --> 53:33.273
What are you hiding, Sheriff?

53:33.275 --> 53:36.677
- What about our missing pets?
- This is exactly what he wants!

53:36.679 --> 53:39.079
Hashtag RememberAl!

53:39.081 --> 53:40.481

Hyah!

54:24.693 --> 54:27.195
Okay!

54:27.197 --> 54:32.766
Who's ready to show this psycho
that we are not afraid?!

54:32.768 --> 54:35.869
- We are!
- Right!

54:35.871 --> 54:38.039
Let's march down Main Street

54:38.041 --> 54:41.175
and give Sheriff Welch
a piece of our mind!

54:41.177 --> 54:44.211
- Yeah!
- Remember Al!

54:44.213 --> 54:47.380
Remember Al! Remember Al!

54:47.382 --> 54:52.552
Remember Al! Remember Al!
Remember Al! Remember Al!

54:57.193 --> 54:59.726
Ugh. I feel like we've been
walking for fucking hours.

54:59.728 --> 55:04.599
My calves are killing me, and
we're only a third of the way.

55:04.601 --> 55:07.068
Ugh. Damn it!

55:07.070 --> 55:09.704
Who are you texting?

55:09.706 --> 55:14.242
No one. Come on, let's go
to the front for a better shot.

55:17.646 --> 55:19.914
Excuse me. Pardon me.

56:01.391 --> 56:03.391
And with a show of force
and goodwill like this,

56:03.393 --> 56:05.693
- one thing is certain.
- Our Midwestern town

56:05.695 --> 56:08.429
won't take any more shit
from this serial killer.

56:12.034 --> 56:14.635
Like and favorite!

56:30.585 --> 56:32.153
Did you...

56:32.155 --> 56:34.387
I was with you the whole time.

56:41.731 --> 56:44.565
Excuse me!

56:44.567 --> 56:45.932
Sadie, McKayla.

56:45.934 --> 56:47.668
Quick sound bite
from the Tragedy Girls?

56:47.670 --> 56:50.271
Oh, I can't even deal
with this right now.

56:50.273 --> 56:51.905
Uh, we are shocked and saddened

56:51.907 --> 56:53.273
that another death
has transpired

56:53.275 --> 56:55.508
due to the apathy
of our law enforcement.

56:55.510 --> 56:57.244
- Good one.
- Is that a direct quote?

56:57.246 --> 56:58.813
Hey, wait your turn!
Are you afraid that the killer

56:58.815 --> 57:00.947
will target you next
because of your infamous blog?

57:00.949 --> 57:05.720
Um, we will not rest until
we stop this menace of society!

57:10.425 --> 57:12.193
Please continue to follow
Tragedy Girls on Twitter.

57:12.195 --> 57:13.760
Excuse me. Thank you.

57:16.833 --> 57:18.298
- Yeah?
- Hey, hon.

57:18.300 --> 57:19.967
A lot of people
have been calling the house...

57:19.969 --> 57:23.704
- CNN, ABC, Barbara Walters.
- Sweetie,

57:23.706 --> 57:25.005
there's someone who calls

57:25.007 --> 57:26.440
who just breathes
into the phone.

57:26.442 --> 57:28.108
Mom, Dad,
just hang up the phone.

57:28.110 --> 57:31.644
Don't talk to anyone.
And lock the doors.

57:31.646 --> 57:33.914
What if it's him?

57:33.916 --> 57:36.416
There's a good chance.

57:36.418 --> 57:38.818
So, you believe
you're being followed?

57:38.820 --> 57:41.287
I've been getting these weird
texts, like when I'm at school.

57:41.289 --> 57:42.889
Someone's been
invading my privacy.

57:42.891 --> 57:44.325
- I know it.
- And I'm pretty sure

57:44.327 --> 57:46.226
- I've seen this guy before.
- He could be the killer.

57:46.228 --> 57:48.729
- He was old.
- Not like <i>you</i> old,

57:48.731 --> 57:51.032
like Father Time old,
but, like, old.

57:51.034 --> 57:53.767
- Kind of out of shape, um...
- 6'6".

57:53.769 --> 57:56.070
- And really old.
- Something like this?

57:59.208 --> 58:01.075
This looks like
Stewie from "Family Guy."

58:01.077 --> 58:02.575
That's terrible, but, yeah.

58:02.577 --> 58:04.744
Yeah, his eyes were
a little bit more beady.

58:04.746 --> 58:08.115
- You should hire somebody.
- Do you think you could, like,

58:08.117 --> 58:10.351
dispatch someone to,
like, my house?

58:10.353 --> 58:12.153
Or escort me to school,
just in case?

58:12.155 --> 58:16.222
Even with all the extra help,
I can't spare a single deputy.

58:16.224 --> 58:18.159
- What?
- The fuck? You're the police.

58:18.161 --> 58:19.760
I could be killed!

58:19.762 --> 58:23.229
Maybe stop checking
in your location online,

58:23.231 --> 58:26.400
and he won't find you.

58:26.402 --> 58:29.670
I'd rather die.

58:33.509 --> 58:34.775
Phones off!

58:34.777 --> 58:36.309
But it's a matter
of life and death.

58:36.311 --> 58:38.912
What if we have to call 911?

58:38.914 --> 58:40.414
I said, phones off!

58:45.788 --> 58:47.987
You know, maybe we should
continue with a conversation

58:47.989 --> 58:50.858
about the dark side
of social media.

58:50.860 --> 58:52.793
Anyone?

58:52.795 --> 58:57.534
Narcissism?
What about shallowness?

58:59.534 --> 59:01.168
Sociopathy?

59:01.170 --> 59:03.771
- I object!
- Yeah, you're singling us out.

59:03.773 --> 59:08.541
People have died!
People who can't be replaced.

59:08.543 --> 59:11.711
I have just about had it
with the both of you,

59:11.713 --> 59:15.115
feeding off misery
like parasites.

59:15.117 --> 59:18.151
You should both be ashamed.

59:18.153 --> 59:21.057
Parasitic.

59:32.434 --> 59:34.735
- I can't do this anymore.
- You're just going to quit?

59:34.737 --> 59:36.302
You can't just
abandon our videos.

59:36.304 --> 59:37.871
We gave you all the footage.

59:37.873 --> 59:41.275
- You can have it back.
- I thought we made a good team.

59:41.277 --> 59:43.510
We do.
I... My dad needs me

59:43.512 --> 59:45.045
more than you guys right now.

59:45.047 --> 59:46.280
- Fuck your dad.
- M-Kay!

59:46.282 --> 59:47.815
Don't talk about
my dad like that.

59:47.817 --> 59:49.883
No. If Sheriff Welch
knew his dick from his donuts,

59:49.885 --> 59:52.353
he would've solved this already.
He's useless.

59:52.355 --> 59:53.987
Just like when your mother
was murdered.

59:53.989 --> 59:55.255
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

59:55.257 --> 59:57.423
That's enough!

59:57.425 --> 01:00:00.661
Come on, Sadie.
We don't need him.

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:05.633
We could Snapchat a used tampon
and it would be huge.

01:00:19.648 --> 01:00:22.749
- Jordan needs to die.
- He's harmless.

01:00:22.751 --> 01:00:24.251
He's making you soft.

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.920
I am not soft.
I am fierce.

01:00:26.922 --> 01:00:29.490
And you shouldn't have
brought up his mom.

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:31.124
Are you still feeling guilty
about that shit?

01:00:31.126 --> 01:00:33.026
Hey, girls.

01:00:33.028 --> 01:00:35.628
If you hear anything weird,
don't hesitate.

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.664
No psychos are gonna get
in here on my watch.

01:00:37.666 --> 01:00:39.599
- Yes, Dad.
- Yes, Mr. Cunningham.

01:00:39.601 --> 01:00:43.304
All right,
I'm gonna hit the hay. Night.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.572
Jordan knows more
than he's letting on.

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:46.139
He doesn't know anything.

01:00:46.141 --> 01:00:48.275
Dude, the way
he was looking at me.

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:50.010
He's always hanging around,
watching.

01:00:50.012 --> 01:00:52.979
It's only a matter of time
before he spills to his dad.

01:00:52.981 --> 01:00:54.682
You're over-reacting.

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:57.016
Fuck.

01:00:57.018 --> 01:00:59.353
- What?
- My phone.

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:01.655
My fucking phone.

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:04.258
- Which one?
- The important one.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.293
I swear it was right...

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:08.829
He took it.

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:11.465
Jordan?
You're being paranoid.

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:12.833
Earlier, with the drive.

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:14.767
I mean, right in front
of my fucking face.

01:01:14.769 --> 01:01:17.804
This is like a total breach!
He dies tonight!

01:01:17.806 --> 01:01:19.740
Lowell could be outside,
figuring out

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:21.407
how to disembowel us
or whatever.

01:01:21.409 --> 01:01:24.445
- It's not even worth the risk.
- If we go to jail,

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:27.584
everything
that we've worked for is fucked.

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:31.651
Look, don't worry. okay?

01:01:31.653 --> 01:01:34.387
I'll sneak into his house
after curfew,

01:01:34.389 --> 01:01:36.289
and I'll slit his throat.

01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:38.025
It'll be quick...

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:40.293
like it never even happened.

01:01:40.295 --> 01:01:43.863
No, he's my friend.

01:01:43.865 --> 01:01:46.099
I'll do it.

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:05.686
Are you, uh, going back
to the station again?

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:09.856
No, figure
I'll stay in tonight.

01:02:09.858 --> 01:02:13.193
We got some extra guys
from Chamberlain on shift.

01:02:13.195 --> 01:02:15.695
They've got it under control.

01:02:15.697 --> 01:02:18.298
We'll have some fun.

01:03:06.414 --> 01:03:08.481
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:03:08.483 --> 01:03:10.450
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:03:10.452 --> 01:03:11.851
I wanted to see you,

01:03:11.853 --> 01:03:13.487
but I didn't think
your dad would be here.

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:16.657
He will freak out
if he catches you.

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:19.525
Is that an Elvis Presley frog?

01:03:19.527 --> 01:03:21.461
Goddamn right, it's
an Elvis Presley frog.

01:03:21.463 --> 01:03:22.595
"You ain't nothing
but a hound frog."

01:03:22.597 --> 01:03:23.996
That's it.

01:03:23.998 --> 01:03:25.532
Are we gonna talk,
or did you just come over

01:03:25.534 --> 01:03:27.333
- to make fun of me?
- Sorry.

01:03:27.335 --> 01:03:30.537
It's just exactly
how I pictured it.

01:03:30.539 --> 01:03:33.807
And how did you
avoid the deputies?

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:37.411
I didn't, really.
They're just bad at their jobs.

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:39.746
They've never been fantastic.

01:03:39.748 --> 01:03:42.084
It's like a thousand degrees
in here.

01:03:43.818 --> 01:03:46.753
Um, um, listen,

01:03:46.755 --> 01:03:49.088
there's something
that I have to tell you.

01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:50.490
Come on, you got this.

01:03:50.492 --> 01:03:52.492
I have something
I need to tell you, too.

01:03:52.494 --> 01:03:56.295
Okay.
Um, you want to go first?

01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:58.365
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:00.566
- You go.
- Okay.

01:04:00.568 --> 01:04:04.905
Um, something McKayla said
the other day...

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:09.242
My mom's death has
never been ruled a murder.

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:13.746
What are you saying?

01:04:13.748 --> 01:04:16.883
I'm saying that I think
she knows more than she lets on,

01:04:16.885 --> 01:04:21.722
about what's happening,
about who's killing people.

01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:25.525
But she was just a kid
when your mom passed away.

01:04:25.527 --> 01:04:28.662
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I-I know it sounds crazy,

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:31.231
and I know that you want
to protect her,

01:04:31.233 --> 01:04:34.700
but maybe she knows the killer.

01:04:34.702 --> 01:04:37.438
What makes you say that?

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.873
Okay, the morning
after Syl's death,

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.809
she had splatter stains
on her shoes.

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:45.112
And to be fair, I didn't get
a good look at it, but...

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:47.014
Oh, you'll get
a good look at it.

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:49.615
In the town meeting,
she sent a text, like,

01:04:49.617 --> 01:04:52.619
right before everyone got
a picture of Big Al dead.

01:04:52.621 --> 01:04:55.088
People text all the time.

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:58.057
Okay. All right?

01:04:58.059 --> 01:05:00.793
Does everyone have

01:05:00.795 --> 01:05:03.831
a second unregistered
cellphone in their backpack?

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:06.666
- I fucking knew it!
- What?

01:05:06.668 --> 01:05:09.536
- Yeah.
- What did you see on it?

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:10.871
Nothing yet. It's locked,

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:13.941
and I haven't finished
cracking it.

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.441
I probably shouldn't be
telling you this,

01:05:15.443 --> 01:05:17.677
but I kind of broke
into the school

01:05:17.679 --> 01:05:19.612
and I got her psych profile

01:05:19.614 --> 01:05:20.914
while everyone
was doing the march.

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:23.182
- Those are private!
- I know, I know,

01:05:23.184 --> 01:05:25.184
I must seem insane right now,
but I think

01:05:25.186 --> 01:05:27.354
there might be something
seriously wrong with her.

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:29.623
She's got, like,
a lot of red flags.

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:31.458
That doesn't mean anything.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:34.927
Just stop defending her, okay?

01:05:34.929 --> 01:05:36.463
Look, if she has something
to do with this,

01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:38.231
or if she's working
with someone,

01:05:38.233 --> 01:05:40.733
I think they might be
ramping up to something big.

01:05:40.735 --> 01:05:43.704
- You're being crazy, J.
- No, I just...

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:45.104
I know what it's like

01:05:45.106 --> 01:05:47.106
to lose someone
that you really care about.

01:05:47.108 --> 01:05:49.208
And I don't know

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:52.012
if I could live with myself
if anything happened to you.

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:55.414
You don't mean that.

01:05:55.416 --> 01:05:58.084
No, I do.
I mean, I think

01:05:58.086 --> 01:06:02.655
you're pretty much
the most amazing, brilliant,

01:06:02.657 --> 01:06:05.691
unique person I've ever met.

01:06:05.693 --> 01:06:08.461
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:06:08.463 --> 01:06:11.798
I think you're special.
To me, at least.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.200
And you have really good taste
in obscure movies,

01:06:14.202 --> 01:06:17.503
and, like,
your hair is, like, super cool.

01:06:17.505 --> 01:06:19.238
And I...

01:06:21.543 --> 01:06:24.978
Ugh. Vom.

01:06:30.452 --> 01:06:33.452
Lehmann?!

01:06:33.454 --> 01:06:35.956
- Did you hear that?
- No, what?

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.791
Listen.

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:40.293
Shit.

01:06:40.295 --> 01:06:42.564
Uh, one second, Dad.

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.632
Shh!

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:50.470
What the...

01:06:58.179 --> 01:07:01.048
Jordan!

01:07:07.322 --> 01:07:10.190
Aaaah!

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:20.099
Shit!

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:26.106
Aaah!

01:07:41.422 --> 01:07:43.090
Aaaah!

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:56.235
Jordan.

01:07:56.237 --> 01:07:58.604
Hold on there, son.

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:03.709
What you doing here?

01:08:03.711 --> 01:08:06.012
She saved my life.

01:08:06.014 --> 01:08:08.949
Thank you.

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:12.351
Yes, uh, I need an ambulance
at 461 Cedar Lane.

01:08:12.353 --> 01:08:15.589
We have one person bleeding
from a large knife wound.

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:30.437
In the two weeks since
the attack at my home,

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.705
there have been no new sightings

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:34.140
of the so-called
Rosedale Ripper.

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:37.376
I'd like to acknowledge
the bravery and forthrightness

01:08:37.377 --> 01:08:40.781
of Rosedale's
very own Sadie Cunningham.

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:46.752
Sadie!

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:50.523
I was humbled to witness
her courage firsthand

01:08:50.524 --> 01:08:54.193
as she fought off her attacker.

01:08:54.194 --> 01:08:58.764
I am eternally indebted to you
for saving my son's life.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:03.903
Go, Sadie!

01:09:03.904 --> 01:09:06.238
Hi. Trish, Channel 5.
I just want to know,

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.541
what's next for
the Tragedy Girl?

01:09:08.542 --> 01:09:10.576
Uh, actually, it's...

01:09:10.578 --> 01:09:12.411
I mean...

01:09:12.412 --> 01:09:16.215
I'm going to continue
to fight for what's right

01:09:16.216 --> 01:09:19.452
and really work to make
the community a safer place.

01:09:19.453 --> 01:09:21.321
You know?

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:32.232
Madam President,
can I speak to you for a moment?

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:34.871
Sure.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.307
- What's up, M-Kay?
- We need to talk.

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:43.910
- Not now. We're at school.
- Who cares?!

01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:47.013
Lower your voice.
They're watching me.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:49.715
Bitch, you love it.

01:09:49.716 --> 01:09:52.952
I saw you
up there on that podium.

01:09:52.953 --> 01:09:55.388
What, are you jelly?

01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:57.324
I am so not jelly.

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:59.526
Is this about
the Tragedy Girl thing?

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:04.030
Look at you, dude.

01:10:04.032 --> 01:10:06.866
Hooking up with that loser
out of pity.

01:10:06.868 --> 01:10:09.503
See, I thought you were
the one with the plan.

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:11.804
The vision? A night to remember?

01:10:11.806 --> 01:10:14.508
Not just cut and run
when shit gets real.

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:18.911
Okay, last I checked, it was me
who had to mop up your mess.

01:10:18.913 --> 01:10:20.312
We'll discuss this later.

01:10:20.314 --> 01:10:22.081
We wouldn't have
a mess to mop up,

01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:24.451
had you had the guts to...

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.820
had you had the guts

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:29.822
to buy the gold balloons
like we had talked about.

01:10:29.824 --> 01:10:32.058
See, I for one,
don't want my prom

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.294
to look like the inside
of your ratchet-ass trailer.

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:39.165
You're such a cliché!

01:10:39.167 --> 01:10:41.134
Don't blame me because
your part of our plan

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:43.202
is always boring and uninspired.

01:10:43.204 --> 01:10:45.805
Okay, there is nothing special
about what you do!

01:10:45.807 --> 01:10:47.240
You only hold me back!

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:49.843
Well, I've never needed you.

01:10:49.845 --> 01:10:52.678
We don't need you.

01:10:57.118 --> 01:10:59.885
Fuck you, Sades.

01:10:59.887 --> 01:11:02.988
Fuck these stupid fucking stars!

01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:06.962
What the fuck
are you looking at?!

01:11:11.233 --> 01:11:13.599
What?!

01:13:03.478 --> 01:13:05.111
Uh, hi, Mr. Cunningham.

01:13:05.113 --> 01:13:08.083
Uh, just here to pick up Sadie.

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:12.121
Uh, uh, J-Jordan.

01:13:13.689 --> 01:13:15.120
Jordan Welch.

01:13:15.122 --> 01:13:18.625
Uh, we've met a couple times.

01:13:18.627 --> 01:13:21.695
My dad's the... sheriff.

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:26.665
Uh, one time in middle school,
you told me, like,

01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:29.102
"Stay away from my daughter."

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:31.170
Uh, I'm here...
I'm here for prom.

01:13:31.172 --> 01:13:33.606
- Um...
- Sadie!

01:13:35.409 --> 01:13:38.445
It's a great house
you have here.

01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:41.481
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:44.784
Uh, could we get a picture
real quick if that's okay?

01:13:44.786 --> 01:13:47.355
There you go.

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:51.590
You got to tap the screen.

01:13:51.592 --> 01:13:54.027
It's just a little...
little tap on the screen.

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:55.932
- Uh...
- Here.

01:14:00.935 --> 01:14:02.768
That's great.

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:05.905
- Dinner's in the fridge, Pop.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

01:14:05.907 --> 01:14:08.474
Bring her home safe.

01:14:08.476 --> 01:14:11.046
Yeah. Yes.

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.754
There we go. Okay.

01:14:21.756 --> 01:14:24.456
And...

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.830
There we go.
It really is an art form.

01:14:30.832 --> 01:14:34.134
Easing off the clutch.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.902
Ease off the clutch.

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:40.173
Ease off the clutch!

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:41.941
Prom! Prom!
Prom! Prom!

01:14:41.943 --> 01:14:44.210
- Prom! Prom! Prom!
- Your ride's here!

01:14:44.212 --> 01:14:45.745
Don't rush her.

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:50.150
- Oh! Look at my baby girl!
- Aww, look at that girl!

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.085
Angelica ain't got nothing
on my baby.

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:53.553
Look at you.

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:56.723
- Cut it out, guys.
- Oh, you only go to prom once.

01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:58.324
And I cannot believe
those boys at your school

01:14:58.326 --> 01:14:59.726
were too afraid to ask you out.

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:01.294
- Why you got to bring that up?
- I'm just saying,

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:02.861
they shouldn't be afraid
of a beautiful woman.

01:15:02.863 --> 01:15:04.731
Well, it's just, you know,
things got a little crazy,

01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:07.700
and there weren't a lot
of guys left to ask me.

01:15:07.702 --> 01:15:09.736
Will Sadie be there?

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:11.470
Yeah, I-I think so.

01:15:11.472 --> 01:15:13.373
I'll tell her
that you guys said hi.

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:15.075
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:17.076
I'll get the door.

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:22.147
Rosedale High, please.

01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:25.552
Yes, ma'am.

01:15:59.386 --> 01:16:02.455
- Isn't this great?
- Sure.

01:16:10.398 --> 01:16:12.098
I'm kind of thirsty.
I'll be right back.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.067
Okay.

01:16:33.488 --> 01:16:36.755
- Nice dress, Sadie.
- You too.

01:16:36.757 --> 01:16:40.160
I want you to know
how proud I am.

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:41.593
You really turned
your attitude around

01:16:41.595 --> 01:16:44.097
in spite of everything
that's happened.

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:47.599
- I guess a lot has changed.
- I hope you don't mind,

01:16:47.601 --> 01:16:51.638
but I put your name forward
for a scholarship.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.040
Young women who
have overcome adversity.

01:16:55.042 --> 01:16:58.076
- Thanks, Mrs. K.
- You're welcome.

01:16:58.078 --> 01:16:59.845
I think I need to go outside,
get some fresh air

01:16:59.847 --> 01:17:02.382
before I lose it.
You have a good night.

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:04.550
- You, as well.
- Okay.

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:15.495
Hey! Come on, what you doing?
It's a great song.

01:17:15.497 --> 01:17:17.796
Just sitting for a bit.

01:17:17.798 --> 01:17:21.668
Hey, look, um...

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:26.104
I-I know that things haven't
really been the same for you

01:17:26.106 --> 01:17:28.840
ever since we got together.

01:17:28.842 --> 01:17:31.777
But I-I just want to
let you know I'm so sorry

01:17:31.779 --> 01:17:34.479
for telling you all that shit
about McKayla.

01:17:34.481 --> 01:17:36.316
I know she had nothing
to do with the murders.

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:39.318
Like, s-she couldn't have.
That's insane.

01:17:41.389 --> 01:17:43.423
Is there anything I can do
to make it up to you?

01:17:45.159 --> 01:17:47.527
Hello? Hello?
Oh, there we go.

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:51.196
- How you doing Rosedale High?!
- Yeah!

01:17:51.198 --> 01:17:54.400
Yeah! Whoo!

01:17:54.402 --> 01:17:57.336
Okay, I'm just gonna say
a few words,

01:17:57.338 --> 01:18:02.040
and then this boring old dude
will get offstage, I promise.

01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:05.111
To say that this was
a tough year

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:08.180
would be
a massive understatement.

01:18:08.182 --> 01:18:09.715
- Yeah.
- No shit.

01:18:09.717 --> 01:18:12.151
But if there's one good thing
that we can take away

01:18:12.153 --> 01:18:15.391
from these dark times,
it's this.

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:19.459
Our friends.

01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:22.894
No matter where you go in life,

01:18:22.896 --> 01:18:24.696
you will always have
with each other

01:18:24.698 --> 01:18:29.669
a bond that is unbreakable.

01:18:32.573 --> 01:18:34.507
I believe that the votes
have been tallied.

01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:36.709
Yes?

01:18:40.448 --> 01:18:43.683
This year's king and queen

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:46.251
are Jordan Welch
and Sadie Cunningham.

01:18:50.024 --> 01:18:52.090
Dude!

01:18:55.029 --> 01:18:57.196
What the...

01:18:57.198 --> 01:18:58.964
Come on.

01:18:58.966 --> 01:19:03.135
We will now commence the prom
king and queen's first dance.

01:19:03.137 --> 01:19:05.405
All hail Jordan and Sadie.

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:15.815
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:21.353
- I think it's rigged.
- No, no, not just that.

01:19:21.355 --> 01:19:25.958
We survived
not just a serial killer

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.460
but high school.

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:35.768
And now we're here.
And I just... I can't tell you

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:39.371
how lucky I feel to share
this dance with my best friend.

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:28.920
Jonathan and Tracey,
what are you doing out here?

01:20:28.922 --> 01:20:31.324
Back inside. Now.

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:33.425
- Yes, Mrs. Kent.
- Yes, Mrs. Kent.

01:20:42.837 --> 01:20:44.937
Mrs. Kent.

01:20:44.939 --> 01:20:47.339
Smoking can cause fires.

01:20:47.341 --> 01:20:49.509
Or didn't Big Al teach you that?

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.744
McKayla, what are you doing
out here?

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:55.180
Oh, just waiting for a friend.

01:20:55.182 --> 01:20:57.250
Speak of the devil.

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:05.491
Jesus Christ.
McKayla!

01:21:22.609 --> 01:21:25.311
- Why?
- Shh.

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:26.646
Please raise your hand

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:29.348
if you have something to say,
Mrs. Kent.

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.460
Now?

01:21:41.462 --> 01:21:43.463
No.

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:45.998
I have an appearance to make.

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:51.603
So, I know we haven't
gotten a chance

01:21:51.605 --> 01:21:53.738
to talk about
when summer's over,

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.741
but have you thought
about Kent State?

01:21:55.743 --> 01:21:57.375
I haven't really decided.

01:21:57.377 --> 01:21:58.811
Because even if you went
with Ohio, like,

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:01.680
we'd still be pretty close by.
That'd be cool.

01:22:01.682 --> 01:22:03.583
- Jordan, listen...
- Hey, dude.

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:05.284
Uh, one sec.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:34.580
Sadie?
You're so brave.

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:36.848
I love you.

01:22:39.453 --> 01:22:41.586
Get the fuck out of my face.

01:22:45.059 --> 01:22:46.659
Yeah, but thanks.
I appreciate it.

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:48.260
No problem.

01:23:06.613 --> 01:23:08.446
M-Kay!

01:23:32.439 --> 01:23:34.507
Hey.

01:23:38.011 --> 01:23:41.282
McKayla, what'd you do
to Mrs. Kent?

01:23:42.984 --> 01:23:45.617
She got what she deserved.

01:23:50.257 --> 01:23:52.625
What do you think?

01:23:52.627 --> 01:23:54.059
Cute, right?

01:23:54.061 --> 01:23:56.928
M-Kay, you don't have
to prove anything to me.

01:23:56.930 --> 01:24:00.165
We made a splash. That's enough.
Don't fuck up your future.

01:24:00.167 --> 01:24:03.402
Fuck up my future?

01:24:03.404 --> 01:24:05.137
What happened to you?

01:24:05.139 --> 01:24:07.772
We used to be the same,
you and me.

01:24:07.774 --> 01:24:10.776
Do you remember our first time?

01:24:10.778 --> 01:24:13.678
- M-Kay, don't.
- Don't what?

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.115
I mean, it was your plan,
after all.

01:24:16.117 --> 01:24:19.652
Poor old bag didn't
even see it coming.

01:24:19.654 --> 01:24:23.656
One minute, she's driving two
girls home from dance practice.

01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:26.959
The next,
she's lying in a ditch.

01:24:29.663 --> 01:24:32.831
Poor Mrs. Welch.

01:24:32.833 --> 01:24:37.637
- It was an accident.
- An accident?

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:39.938
Is that what you tell yourself?

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:42.942
Because we both wanted it!

01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:46.144
But, oh, you were the one
who was cold as ice.

01:24:46.146 --> 01:24:51.784
I remember crying and crying
the next day...

01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:55.553
jumping every time
the phone rang...

01:24:55.555 --> 01:24:58.523
scared that I would blurt it
all out at the dinner table...

01:25:01.929 --> 01:25:05.563
...that I would let down
my best friend.

01:25:05.565 --> 01:25:07.532
And then you abandoned me?

01:25:07.534 --> 01:25:11.370
I mean, you even became friends
with her son!

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:13.738
Him over me!

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:16.142
I thought I was going crazy!

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:20.579
The old Sadie, she wasn't
like everybody else.

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:27.119
No, she was something
real special.

01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:30.289
And she would agree with me.

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:33.526
But if you want to be dancing
under that spotlight

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:36.995
with those fucking sheep,

01:25:36.997 --> 01:25:40.700
then you're better off dead
with the rest of them.

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:43.068
- I never meant to hurt you.
- Oh, please.

01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:44.836
I'm like, so over it.

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:48.441
I believe you've already met
my prom date.

01:25:54.247 --> 01:25:57.750
Been waiting a long time,
for this...

01:25:57.752 --> 01:26:00.452
to gut you...

01:26:00.454 --> 01:26:03.155
feast on your flesh.

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:06.291
Oh, scary, Lowell.
Nice.

01:26:06.293 --> 01:26:08.760
See, he's not much
of a sweet talker,

01:26:08.762 --> 01:26:11.464
but he knows how to
show a girl a good time.

01:26:11.466 --> 01:26:14.099
So, that's it?

01:26:14.101 --> 01:26:17.236
You're just gonna
kill your best friend?

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:21.272
Dude, no.
No, I'm here to save you.

01:26:21.274 --> 01:26:24.442
We're gonna finish this
just like we planned.

01:26:24.444 --> 01:26:26.711
A night to remember.

01:26:26.713 --> 01:26:28.914
No!

01:26:28.916 --> 01:26:30.482
Sadie, run! Hurry!

01:26:30.484 --> 01:26:32.785
No!

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:48.634
Come on, Jordan,
climbing up the stairs?

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:50.602
It's like you want
to get caught.

01:26:50.604 --> 01:26:52.370
Just like your mother.

01:26:52.372 --> 01:26:54.205
Sadie, come to me, baby.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.843
Hey! Michael Myers knock-off!

01:26:57.845 --> 01:27:00.146
I told you, she's off limits!

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:04.083
Did you think I'd forget
what you did to me?

01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:08.454
Chained, tortured, dog food?

01:27:08.456 --> 01:27:12.924
I'm gonna repay the favor until
you're begging me to kill you!

01:27:12.926 --> 01:27:14.692
Lowell, calm down.

01:27:14.694 --> 01:27:17.830
We both know that you're not
very good with the thinking,

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:20.132
especially after
all the chloroform.

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:22.835
You and I, we're the same,
remember?

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:24.769
No.

01:27:24.771 --> 01:27:27.238
You spend your life

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:30.175
putting fake bullshit
on the Internet!

01:27:30.177 --> 01:27:33.978
I'm gonna show you
what it really looks like!!

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:36.714
Stay away from her!

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:50.028
I missed you so much.

01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:52.464
Shut up.
I missed you so much!

01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:59.170
Sadie.

01:27:59.172 --> 01:28:02.074
Sadie, come here.
Sadie, get away from her.

01:28:02.076 --> 01:28:04.943
Get away from her.
We need to call the police.

01:28:04.945 --> 01:28:07.646
You're gonna pay
for what you did.

01:28:07.648 --> 01:28:11.016
Jordan, wait.

01:28:11.018 --> 01:28:13.152
She's my best friend.

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:16.655
She just tried to kill you!

01:28:16.657 --> 01:28:18.223
And... And me!

01:28:18.225 --> 01:28:22.061
She murdered my mom!
She...

01:28:22.063 --> 01:28:24.796
You ruined my life.

01:28:27.368 --> 01:28:29.401
So did I.

01:28:29.403 --> 01:28:33.341
Sadie, no, no, no.
Listen to me.

01:28:35.275 --> 01:28:38.843
I love you... the real you.

01:28:38.845 --> 01:28:41.679
Come on,
you're nothing like her.

01:28:41.681 --> 01:28:43.915
Oh, J.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:57.228
You don't know me at all.

01:31:35.855 --> 01:31:38.456
Is my son in there?!

01:31:38.458 --> 01:31:41.692
No!

01:31:41.694 --> 01:31:44.062
No!

01:31:44.064 --> 01:31:46.397
I guess you were right.

01:31:46.399 --> 01:31:48.901
- Best night ever.
- Best night ever.

01:31:54.442 --> 01:31:57.843
No-o!

01:32:03.516 --> 01:32:05.550
Months have passed since
the Rosedale Massacre

01:32:05.552 --> 01:32:09.120
claimed the lives
of nearly 124 students.

01:32:09.122 --> 01:32:11.990
But the healing
has only just begun.

01:32:11.992 --> 01:32:15.760
From this moment,
I resign my post

01:32:15.762 --> 01:32:17.228
as the sheriff of this community

01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:19.932
to focus on charity work

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:22.701
in... my son's name.

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:26.170
Later in the hour,
we'll have new information

01:32:26.172 --> 01:32:27.705
on Lowell Orson Lehmann,

01:32:27.707 --> 01:32:30.342
and how he planned and
carried out the grisly murders

01:32:30.344 --> 01:32:33.010
in our sleepy town.

01:32:33.012 --> 01:32:35.214
As for Rosedale's
so-called Tragedy Girls,

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:37.749
the brave Sadie Cunningham
and McKayla Hooper

01:32:37.751 --> 01:32:40.686
have managed to turn
tragedy into triumph.

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:43.321
With an upcoming book tour,
major interviews,

01:32:43.323 --> 01:32:45.190
and a Lifetime movie
in the works,

01:32:45.192 --> 01:32:46.491
I sat down with the girls

01:32:46.493 --> 01:32:48.626
to discuss their plans
for the future.

01:32:48.628 --> 01:32:51.295
Uh, we'd just like to be
normal, down-to-earth students.

01:32:51.297 --> 01:32:53.732
I mean, living a life
of anonymity, really.

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:55.601
Getting full scholarships
certainly helps,

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:58.736
but for now, I'd like to focus
on my program as a film major.

01:32:58.738 --> 01:33:01.572
McKayla, what do you feel
is your greatest triumph?

01:33:01.574 --> 01:33:03.608
Finding a best friend
like Sadie.

01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:06.044
That's awesome, tight?

01:33:06.046 --> 01:33:07.678
Hashtag blessed.

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:10.581
Ugh!
Dude, I hate that top!

01:33:10.583 --> 01:33:13.085
- Shut up, you look great.
- You guys all set?

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:14.486
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:33:14.488 --> 01:33:16.455
Look, be careful.
Call if you need anything.

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:19.394
- Dad...
- Look out for each other.

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:22.561
There are 10 dinners
in the freezer.

01:33:22.563 --> 01:33:24.530
Thanks, kiddo.

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:26.531
- Dad, stop crying!
- Love you.

01:33:26.533 --> 01:33:29.668
- Love you.
- Let's do it!

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:34.138
- Be careful, no texting!
- No promises!

01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:38.710
- We did good.
- Yeah.

01:33:41.148 --> 01:33:42.880

It's for, like,
a really good cause.

We may have survived
Rosedale...

01:33:49.556 --> 01:33:52.257
But we're ready to start
a whole new chapter.

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:54.358
- Stay tuned.
- And keep following...

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.128
