WEBVTT

00:06.148 --> 00:07.950
And thank you for
choosing Bud's Buds.

00:07.984 --> 00:10.253
Our goal is to provide
an upscale shopping experience.

00:10.287 --> 00:12.722
Enjoy your Buzzed Lightyear.

00:15.625 --> 00:17.927
Wow. Is nothing sacred?

00:19.462 --> 00:21.030
I'm here to give you
something no drug dealer

00:21.063 --> 00:23.232
has ever had
to deal with: taxes.

00:23.266 --> 00:26.235
Not a drug dealer,
but let's not let the facts

00:26.269 --> 00:28.405
get in the way of a good insult.

00:28.438 --> 00:30.239
Listen, you got to give me
your quarterly tax returns,

00:30.273 --> 00:32.609
all right? Somewhere, Scarface
is rolling over in his grave.

00:32.642 --> 00:36.145
(Cuban accent): "Say hello
to my little Schedule C."

00:36.178 --> 00:38.915
Wow. That is
a really good Pacino.

00:38.948 --> 00:40.617
Hey, why don't you show me
what he would be like

00:40.650 --> 00:42.919
leaving a pot store?

00:42.952 --> 00:44.153
(normal voice):
Look at you,

00:44.186 --> 00:45.755
giving one as good
as you got one.

00:45.788 --> 00:47.590
Well, kind of--
you're not very good at this.

00:47.624 --> 00:49.091
Uh, anything else, Mike?

00:49.125 --> 00:51.394
Well, actually, there is
something very important.

00:51.428 --> 00:54.564
I wanted to get my wife
a gift that says I love her,

00:54.597 --> 00:56.299
something very special.

00:56.333 --> 00:59.769
I'm thinking roach clip.

00:59.802 --> 01:01.604
-Roach clip?
-Yeah.

01:01.638 --> 01:03.973
Might want to, uh,
try the museum.

01:04.006 --> 01:05.808
Actually, I was hoping
I could get you

01:05.842 --> 01:08.010
to let me have Boyd
for the weekend.

01:08.044 --> 01:09.746
Oh, I was thinking
of doing something with Boyd

01:09.779 --> 01:11.013
-for the weekend.
-Oh, come on.

01:11.047 --> 01:12.415
I think he needs
a little grandpa time.

01:12.449 --> 01:13.683
I want to take him fishing.

01:13.716 --> 01:16.519
Okay. Yeah. He loves fishing.

01:16.553 --> 01:18.421
But only because I have yet
to convince him

01:18.455 --> 01:20.256
that fish feel pain.

01:20.289 --> 01:21.591
Hey, if you don't
want to get caught,

01:21.624 --> 01:22.925
you shouldn't live in a river.

01:22.959 --> 01:25.328
That's...
(laughs)

01:25.362 --> 01:27.764
Yeah. Boy, this is clever.

01:27.797 --> 01:30.266
"Yes We Can-nabis."

01:30.299 --> 01:33.736
I-I got to get
out of this joint.

01:34.737 --> 01:36.739
*

01:44.647 --> 01:46.816
-Hey, Dad. Got a minute?
-Not right now.

01:46.849 --> 01:49.886
I'm picking out waders
for my fishing trip with Boyd.

01:49.919 --> 01:52.855
Now, watch this. I think these
are slimming, right?

01:52.889 --> 01:55.692
But I think these
bring out my eyes.

01:55.725 --> 01:58.695
Hmm. Uh, that one.

01:58.728 --> 02:02.031
I think Rihanna wore those
to Kennedy Center Honors.

02:02.064 --> 02:05.635
That's where I saw them.

02:05.668 --> 02:09.205
Uh, and about that fishing trip,
Ryan had plans

02:09.238 --> 02:11.508
-with Boyd this weekend.
-No, I talked to him.

02:11.541 --> 02:12.809
He said he was "thinking
about doing something."

02:12.842 --> 02:14.577
And for a liberal,

02:14.611 --> 02:16.212
when they say they're thinking
about doing something,

02:16.245 --> 02:17.980
-that's usually the end of it.
-Hmm.

02:18.014 --> 02:20.383
Yeah, no, he has
the whole thing planned,

02:20.417 --> 02:22.184
and he's been looking forward
to it for weeks.

02:22.218 --> 02:23.520
Well, why didn't
he just say that?

02:23.553 --> 02:25.722
I know this may sound
crazy to you, Dad,

02:25.755 --> 02:28.157
but maybe he's just
being a nice guy.

02:28.190 --> 02:31.327
Really? So, him not letting me
be a nice guy

02:31.360 --> 02:34.531
is him being a nice guy?

02:34.564 --> 02:36.298
That's like Obama logic.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.438
Well, I'm giving you the chance
to be a nice guy right now.

02:41.471 --> 02:44.874
Let Ryan spend the weekend
with his son.

02:44.907 --> 02:47.209
Fine, I'll let him be
with his son.

02:47.243 --> 02:49.779
Uh, great. Thank you. Uh, Boyd's
upstairs. I'll go tell him.

02:49.812 --> 02:51.548
That's all right,
I'll tell Boyd.

02:51.581 --> 02:53.550
You know, I can hog
that nice guy spotlight

02:53.583 --> 02:55.918
just as well as Ryan can.

02:55.952 --> 02:57.554
Where does he want
to take him this weekend?

02:57.587 --> 02:58.955
He's taking him
to an arts and crafts festival

02:58.988 --> 03:00.423
-in Steamboat Springs.
-Hmm.

03:00.457 --> 03:03.225
They're gonna learn
how to hook a rug.

03:05.394 --> 03:09.599
Give a man a rug and he has
something to walk on.

03:09.632 --> 03:14.437
Teach a man to hook a rug,
and you've wasted a weekend.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.378
WOMAN (over speaker): It's been
45 years since the five bodies

03:22.411 --> 03:23.980
were found in shallow graves

03:24.013 --> 03:26.816
near the sleepy town
of Leadville, Colorado.

03:26.849 --> 03:29.385
Authorities finally agree
the identity

03:29.418 --> 03:31.721
of the Leadville Killer is...

03:31.754 --> 03:34.491
This is so exciting. I still
think it was the football coach.

03:34.524 --> 03:37.126
He left the high school at 4:00
and went to the bank.

03:37.159 --> 03:41.097
The second victim was found
on a riverbank. Coincidence?

03:41.130 --> 03:43.933
You know, I-I think
it was the town butcher.

03:43.966 --> 03:48.104
I mean, for one thing,
he was the town butcher.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.940
What about those four John Does?

03:50.973 --> 03:53.676
Clearly, they're related.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.111
All right, here we go.

03:55.144 --> 03:58.915
And the identity
of the Leadville Killer is...

03:58.948 --> 04:00.983
WOMAN:
...unknown to this day.

04:01.017 --> 04:02.819
-Boo.
-Are you kidding?

04:02.852 --> 04:04.621
WOMAN:
His identity is lost,

04:04.654 --> 04:07.156
like the lives
of those he took.

04:07.189 --> 04:09.626
The Leadville Murder Chronicles
are brought to you

04:09.659 --> 04:13.429
by Flom Flom.
Flom Flom-- get connected.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.432
What? We spent weeks on this,
and it's unsolved?

04:16.465 --> 04:18.635
They should tell us that
in the first episode.

04:18.668 --> 04:20.469
It's like, no one
would watch Scooby-Doo

04:20.503 --> 04:23.439
if they didn't tell you
who the bad guy was at the end.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.274
Who am I kidding?
I'd still watch.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.276
That dog is a genius.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.712
Mandy, excuse me.
Guys, uh, can't do lunch today.

04:29.746 --> 04:31.347
Got to do something
with Boyd. Sorry.

04:31.380 --> 04:33.382
That's okay, Dad.
Kyle and I are solving a murder.

04:33.415 --> 04:35.384
Really?
Thought this was Personnel.

04:35.417 --> 04:38.354
I didn't realize we had
a homicide division.

04:38.387 --> 04:40.389
No. We are listening
to a podcast

04:40.422 --> 04:42.491
-about the Leadville murders.
-Mm-hmm.

04:42.525 --> 04:43.960
I think we can crack it.

04:43.993 --> 04:45.327
You may remember
that summer at the cabin

04:45.361 --> 04:47.496
when I won two games of Clue.

04:47.530 --> 04:48.898
Very impressive.

04:48.931 --> 04:51.701
That's how Comey got his job.

04:51.734 --> 04:55.237
This is weird. Wow.

04:55.271 --> 04:59.441
This one here kind of looks
like Ed if he had hair.

05:01.744 --> 05:03.345
I'll see you at home, guys.

05:03.379 --> 05:05.181
Kyle, get back to work.

05:05.214 --> 05:06.649
(scoffs)
Ed with hair.

05:06.683 --> 05:09.151
(chuckles)
Ed never had hair.

05:09.185 --> 05:10.720
Wait.

05:10.753 --> 05:15.191
In 1972, Ed would have had hair.

05:15.224 --> 05:17.226
Do you think...?

05:17.259 --> 05:19.662
Wait, no, no.
The-the profiler said the killer

05:19.696 --> 05:22.665
was an experienced hunter
with excellent survival skills.

05:22.699 --> 05:26.068
But that could be a ton
of people in Colorado.

05:26.102 --> 05:27.670
They also said he was
a short-tempered man

05:27.704 --> 05:29.071
with a dancer's body.

05:31.407 --> 05:33.409
Zoinks.

05:37.880 --> 05:42.118
Hey, kid, only my grandson
can touch stuff on my desk.

05:42.151 --> 05:43.452
(laughs)
Hi, Grandpa.

05:43.485 --> 05:44.921
Oh, it's you.

05:44.954 --> 05:47.423
Listen, don't touch stuff
on my desk.

05:47.456 --> 05:50.092
Hey, can we go downstairs and
get a new rod for this weekend?

05:50.126 --> 05:51.761
Uh, we're not going fishing
this weekend, and you're not

05:51.794 --> 05:53.596
gonna want to after you find out
where your dad

05:53.630 --> 05:55.131
is planning to take you.

05:55.164 --> 05:56.733
I thought he was working.

05:56.766 --> 05:58.267
No. He wants to spend time
with you.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.469
He wants to take you
to a special arts festival

06:00.502 --> 06:02.404
in Steamboat.

06:02.438 --> 06:03.640
What about our fishing trip?

06:03.673 --> 06:05.074
We can do that any time.
I can reschedule.

06:05.107 --> 06:06.976
I'll just call the fish.

06:07.009 --> 06:08.911
-Hey.
-Hey, I was just telling him

06:08.945 --> 06:11.580
about that little arts festival
you want to take him to.

06:11.614 --> 06:13.082
Sounds like fun, Dad.

06:13.115 --> 06:14.283
Uh, yeah, it is fun.
But, you know,

06:14.316 --> 06:15.818
so is fishing with your grandpa.

06:15.852 --> 06:17.486
So we'll go to the festival
another time.

06:17.519 --> 06:19.388
Oh, no, no.
No, we're not gonna go fishing.

06:19.421 --> 06:23.159
You know, you're gonna witness
the birth of a rug. Come on.

06:23.192 --> 06:25.461
So, so, wait, are we,
are we fishing or not?

06:25.494 --> 06:27.296
-No. No... no.
-Yes.

06:27.329 --> 06:29.632
Your kid wants to go with you.
I'm gonna let you take him.

06:29.666 --> 06:31.133
But he's looking forward
to the fishing trip with you,

06:31.167 --> 06:33.135
so I'm letting you take him.

06:33.169 --> 06:34.270
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

06:34.303 --> 06:35.672
No, you're not.

06:35.705 --> 06:37.573
This is a weird fight.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.008
-We're not fighting.
-No, no.

06:39.041 --> 06:40.509
I'm just trying
to do something nice,

06:40.542 --> 06:42.945
and you're not gonna let me?

06:42.979 --> 06:44.613
I'm trying to do something nice,
and you're not gonna let me?

06:44.647 --> 06:46.448
Actually, I have a better idea.

06:46.482 --> 06:49.118
We should all do
something together.

06:49.151 --> 06:51.153
(both laugh)

06:53.455 --> 06:55.591
Oh, really?

06:55.624 --> 06:58.094
Yeah, seriously. Fishing or art?

06:58.127 --> 07:00.096
There's a balloon race
this weekend in Grand Lake.

07:00.129 --> 07:03.265
We should all drive up there
and watch it.

07:03.299 --> 07:07.303
Oh. Did I mention
it's arts and crafts?

07:07.336 --> 07:10.139
Is that what you really want
to do, Boyd?

07:10.172 --> 07:12.141
It is. I think it would be great

07:12.174 --> 07:14.643
if we could all just hang out
and have fun.

07:14.677 --> 07:18.314
Uh... you up for that, Mike?

07:18.347 --> 07:20.049
Hmm.

07:23.085 --> 07:26.288
Yeah.

07:26.322 --> 07:28.024
Balloon race? Come on,

07:28.057 --> 07:31.627
NASCAR of the sky, as they...

07:31.660 --> 07:33.662
I'm all in.

07:40.436 --> 07:43.539
All packed up for my delightful
road trip with Ryan.

07:43.572 --> 07:46.175
I think I got everything
except my cyanide tablets.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.144
Oh, come on, Mike, it'll be fun.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.712
Yeah, it'll be a lot of fun.

07:49.746 --> 07:51.881
People on blankets staring
at people in baskets.

07:51.914 --> 07:53.649
Sounds like a real hootenanny.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.585
Well, I'm sure Ryan's
looking forward to it.

07:56.618 --> 07:58.320
This is gonna be
the worst weekend of my life.

07:58.354 --> 07:59.922
It's two days.

07:59.956 --> 08:02.324
I was in labor for two days.

08:02.358 --> 08:04.927
In a car? With your dad?

08:04.961 --> 08:06.562
Just visualize
something positive,

08:06.595 --> 08:09.732
like a kitten playing
with a ball of yarn. Meow.

08:09.766 --> 08:12.601
Or a lion playing
with your dad's head.

08:12.634 --> 08:14.603
Whatever works for you.

08:14.636 --> 08:16.705
-And remember,
my dad respects you.
-Oh, please,

08:16.739 --> 08:18.274
I'm your dad's punching bag.

08:18.307 --> 08:20.242
It's gonna be two hours
of stand-up comedy

08:20.276 --> 08:22.611
about my slow driving, my music,

08:22.644 --> 08:25.581
my bumper sticker that says,
"Arms Are for Hugging."

08:25.614 --> 08:27.116
I know mine are.

08:28.384 --> 08:30.186
Mwah. Don't worry.

08:30.219 --> 08:33.622
I bet my dad is glad
that he doesn't have to drive.

08:33.655 --> 08:35.792
And Ryan'll be driving, which
means I got to deal with a lot

08:35.825 --> 08:38.594
of people with their thumbs up
because they like whales, too.

08:38.627 --> 08:40.696
Why are you getting
so worked up about this?

08:40.729 --> 08:42.131
You've taken trips
with Ryan before.

08:42.164 --> 08:44.200
Yeah, but the last time
I took a trip with him

08:44.233 --> 08:45.434
was with he and his dad,
the only person on Earth

08:45.467 --> 08:47.703
that makes me feel sorry
for Ryan.

08:47.736 --> 08:48.905
You know what?
The trip might be easier

08:48.938 --> 08:50.406
if you didn't criticize him
so much.

08:50.439 --> 08:53.142
Didn't criticize him?
We-we have to talk.

08:53.175 --> 08:55.111
(laughs)

08:55.144 --> 08:56.578
-Okay, what?
-I... No, I just,

08:56.612 --> 08:57.980
I think it's so funny

08:58.014 --> 08:59.982
that-that the one time you guys
try to do something nice

09:00.016 --> 09:01.383
for each other,
it bites you in the ass.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.485
He was not trying to do
something nice.

09:03.519 --> 09:06.122
He was trying to do something
nicer than me.

09:06.155 --> 09:10.492
And if he thinks he can out-nice
me, I will squash that turd.

09:11.493 --> 09:12.895
(phone ringing)

09:12.929 --> 09:14.831
Oh. Hey, hon.

09:14.864 --> 09:17.733
Tell me this isn't gonna be
as bad as I think it is.

09:17.766 --> 09:22.504
Well, your dad and Ryan trapped
in a car for a two-hour drive?

09:22.538 --> 09:25.174
I hope you have a black dress.

09:29.211 --> 09:32.581
We know Mr. Alzate. There's no
way he's the Leadville Killer.

09:32.614 --> 09:36.185
Honey, we are amateur
professional detectives.

09:36.218 --> 09:37.987
We need to pursue every lead.

09:38.020 --> 09:40.489
And once we talk to Ed,
we can cross him off our list.

09:40.522 --> 09:43.259
Yeah, w-we're not accusing him,
we're-we're exonerating him.

09:43.292 --> 09:46.195
You know, we're just doing
our Scooby-Doo diligence.

09:46.228 --> 09:48.197
Exactly. And once Ed is cleared,

09:48.230 --> 09:50.466
we can move onto our other
unidentified suspects,

09:50.499 --> 09:52.935
Cowboy Hat and Scowl Face.

09:52.969 --> 09:55.137
I got my eyes on Scowl Face.

09:55.171 --> 09:58.107
You know, I mean, just the name
sounds like a criminal.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.476
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:00.509 --> 10:03.479
Mandy, how nice of you
to bring us lunch.

10:03.512 --> 10:05.047
Uh, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

10:05.081 --> 10:08.450
Well, it's just been so long
since we've got to talk.

10:08.484 --> 10:11.020
Yeah, uh, you know, we just
thought it'd be fun to catch up.

10:11.053 --> 10:12.855
-Oh.
-Like, uh, Mandy and I,

10:12.889 --> 10:15.357
we were just talking about this
podcast we're listening to.

10:15.391 --> 10:17.960
Podcast. And what's that?

10:17.994 --> 10:20.729
Oh, it's like the radio,
but on your phone.

10:20.762 --> 10:23.065
It sounds unnecessary.

10:23.099 --> 10:26.936
Well, the one we're listening to
takes place in Leadville.

10:30.739 --> 10:32.541
Leadville?

10:32.574 --> 10:36.545
Now, why do you bring up
Leadville?

10:36.578 --> 10:40.749
Oh, that's just where the case
took place, back in 1972.

10:40.782 --> 10:42.318
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Now, why would I care

10:42.351 --> 10:44.987
about Leadville in 1972?

10:45.021 --> 10:47.423
Well, we saw this picture,

10:47.456 --> 10:49.225
and the guy kind of looked
like a young you.

10:50.059 --> 10:51.027
Crazy, right?

10:51.060 --> 10:52.194
(both chuckle)

10:52.228 --> 10:54.663
Whatever picture you found

10:54.696 --> 10:56.598
is none of your business.

10:56.632 --> 10:58.734
All right?

10:58.767 --> 11:00.369
You really shouldn't
be snooping around.

11:00.402 --> 11:02.104
Someone could get hurt.

11:02.138 --> 11:06.042
Hey, you're making it sound
like you have something to hide.

11:06.075 --> 11:08.110
Anyone who's interesting
has something to hide.

11:10.312 --> 11:12.248
Thanks for the lunch.

11:16.552 --> 11:18.254
What does all this mean?

11:18.287 --> 11:22.091
It means Scowl Face
is off the hook.

11:25.461 --> 11:27.863
This is nice.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.532
Really?
Surprised to hear you say that.

11:30.566 --> 11:31.934
Yeah.

11:31.968 --> 11:34.403
It reminds me of driving
with my grandmother

11:34.436 --> 11:37.139
-on long road trips.
-(makes smacking sound)

11:37.173 --> 11:40.142
Right down to the mouth noises.

11:40.176 --> 11:42.111
My mouth is dry.

11:42.144 --> 11:44.146
Do you want a hard candy
out of your purse?

11:44.180 --> 11:48.117
-I like the way you drive, Dad.
-Thank you, Boyd.

11:48.150 --> 11:50.252
Well, the good thing
about driving this slow is

11:50.286 --> 11:53.956
it won't hurt when I fling
myself out of the car.

11:53.990 --> 11:57.826
And there's a meadow coming up
in three, two, one, liar.

11:57.859 --> 11:59.228
Why don't we listen
to the radio?

11:59.261 --> 12:00.229
No, we're not listening
to the radio.

12:00.262 --> 12:01.897
No more NPR. Please, God!

12:01.930 --> 12:03.899
What is your problem
with listening to public radio

12:03.932 --> 12:05.467
and, I don't know,
maybe learning something?

12:05.501 --> 12:06.969
I have learned something--
don't listen to NPR.

12:07.003 --> 12:08.437
How about that?

12:08.470 --> 12:10.672
Right there is
the problem with conservatives.

12:10.706 --> 12:12.008
You stick your fingers
in your ears

12:12.041 --> 12:13.675
so you don't have
to hear the truth.

12:13.709 --> 12:15.411
A liberal sticks a finger
in his ear,

12:15.444 --> 12:17.579
it'll poke out the other side.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.248
Can we not argue the whole time?

12:19.281 --> 12:21.250
Yes. Sorry.

12:21.283 --> 12:24.153
Why don't we just not talk
for a little bit?

12:24.186 --> 12:28.157
(engine rattles)

12:28.190 --> 12:30.326
-What is that?
-I don't know.

12:30.359 --> 12:32.194
It makes that noise
every once in a while,

12:32.228 --> 12:34.196
and then that stupid light
comes on.

12:34.230 --> 12:35.364
What's the light say?

12:35.397 --> 12:37.033
"Check Engine."

12:37.066 --> 12:40.002
-What do you suppose that means?
-I don't know.

12:40.036 --> 12:41.303
How about check engine?

12:41.337 --> 12:43.039
Not just to look
and see if it's there.

12:43.072 --> 12:45.041
We're never gonna
make it up the pass.

12:45.074 --> 12:47.109
It's fine, okay.
Old cars make noises.

12:47.143 --> 12:49.511
Part of their charm.

12:49.545 --> 12:51.480
(engine sputters, dies)

12:51.513 --> 12:53.882
Uh-oh.

12:56.885 --> 12:58.887
(whispers):
Charming.

13:07.196 --> 13:09.665
Hey, do you have
any tools in here?

13:09.698 --> 13:10.966
Uh, I have my woodworking tools.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.369
Well, perfect.
We can chop a tree down

13:13.402 --> 13:16.038
and whittle ourselves
a socket set.

13:16.072 --> 13:17.873
You know what my mistake was?

13:17.906 --> 13:19.641
Well, asking me that question

13:19.675 --> 13:21.477
wasn't the brightest thing
you've ever done.

13:21.510 --> 13:25.714
I should've just told Boyd that
he was going fishing with you.

13:25.747 --> 13:28.817
Well, then you wouldn't have
been able to look like the hero

13:28.850 --> 13:30.486
and make me out to be
the bad guy.

13:30.519 --> 13:31.820
That's not what I was doing.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.021
If anything, I was trying
to make you look good.

13:33.055 --> 13:34.490
Oh, that's impossible.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.658
Me just standing next to you,
I look good.

13:36.692 --> 13:39.361
Please. I dance circles
around you when we argue.

13:39.395 --> 13:43.165
Oh, I think your "Check Ego"
light just popped on.

13:43.199 --> 13:45.867
Look, when you take Boyd
for the weekend,

13:45.901 --> 13:48.036
it takes me an entire week
to deprogram out

13:48.070 --> 13:49.938
all the fascist ideas
you teach him.

13:49.971 --> 13:52.241
Well, then, why did you want me
to go fishing with him?

13:52.274 --> 13:55.344
Because you also teach him
things that I can't, okay?

13:55.377 --> 13:57.713
And he thinks
you're the greatest.

13:57.746 --> 13:59.715
And it drives me crazy.

13:59.748 --> 14:02.218
I love every single thing
you just said.

14:04.986 --> 14:06.788
You remember my dad, right?

14:06.822 --> 14:08.390
Met him twice.

14:08.424 --> 14:10.592
-First and last time.
-Exactly.

14:10.626 --> 14:13.229
But I love my grandpa
like Boyd loves you.

14:13.262 --> 14:15.231
And my dad hated it.

14:15.264 --> 14:17.466
And eventually he said,
"That's it.

14:17.499 --> 14:19.034
No more time with Grandpa."

14:19.067 --> 14:20.969
And I was all like,
"But I love Grandpa."

14:21.002 --> 14:22.738
And he was like, "Oh, what,
are you gonna cry now,

14:22.771 --> 14:24.106
you little baby?"

14:24.140 --> 14:25.574
Should we interrupt him?
I don't think so.

14:25.607 --> 14:27.243
You talk to him.
I'm not gonna talk to him.

14:27.276 --> 14:31.647
My dad stopped letting me
hang out with my grandpa.

14:34.850 --> 14:38.287
When he got sick...

14:38.320 --> 14:41.790
my dad wouldn't even
let me see him.

14:41.823 --> 14:45.594
Now all I have left are
those stupid woodworking tools.

14:45.627 --> 14:48.063
All right.

14:48.096 --> 14:51.333
This is very hard
for me to say...

14:51.367 --> 14:54.002
but could you move a little,
'cause you're in the light.

14:54.035 --> 14:55.637
Yeah, why would you get it,
right?

14:55.671 --> 14:57.406
I get it, okay? I get it.
I'm sorry.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.774
You just don't want
to turn out and make

14:58.807 --> 15:00.476
the same mistakes
your dad did, all right?

15:00.509 --> 15:02.311
But you don't have to worry
about that sort of thing.

15:02.344 --> 15:04.513
First off, there's no way
you could keep me

15:04.546 --> 15:06.582
-from seeing my grandson.
-(scoffs) I could.

15:06.615 --> 15:07.983
No, you couldn't.

15:08.016 --> 15:10.452
Okay, I couldn't.

15:10.486 --> 15:13.955
We're not our dads, all right.
You're not your dad.

15:13.989 --> 15:15.824
Yeah, I know that, all right.

15:15.857 --> 15:17.693
But when it comes
to being a father,

15:17.726 --> 15:20.462
the only thing I know for
certain is what not to do.

15:20.496 --> 15:23.031
I get it.
Well, you should do what I did.

15:23.064 --> 15:25.534
You know, you...
just go with your instincts.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.203
Follow your instincts.

15:27.236 --> 15:28.804
You know, and as far as being
a parent's concerned--

15:28.837 --> 15:30.206
and that's about it--

15:30.239 --> 15:32.974
you're-you're pretty spot-on.

15:33.008 --> 15:37.379
Wow.
Rare compliment.

15:37.413 --> 15:40.015
I thought it would feel better.

15:40.048 --> 15:42.351
But I actually feel like
I drank a Slurpee too fast.

15:47.356 --> 15:49.157
Okay, here's what we know.

15:49.191 --> 15:51.627
The Leadville Killer
was never found,

15:51.660 --> 15:53.562
and Mr. Alzate is
the Leadville Killer.

15:55.564 --> 15:57.533
Whoa, we don't know that.

15:57.566 --> 16:00.135
He fits the profile, we can
place him in the area

16:00.168 --> 16:02.571
of the killings, and he won't
talk about his time there.

16:02.604 --> 16:06.542
That evidence is not
just "circumcisional."

16:09.077 --> 16:10.512
So, what are you saying?

16:10.546 --> 16:13.215
I'm saying...

16:13.249 --> 16:14.983
it may be time
to go to the police.

16:15.016 --> 16:18.254
Oh, no, no, I would
drop dead twice before I rat out

16:18.287 --> 16:20.556
Mr. A to Johnny Law.

16:20.589 --> 16:23.992
And that is detective speak
for "no way."

16:24.025 --> 16:26.362
Wait, so you wouldn't
turn Ed in,

16:26.395 --> 16:28.096
even if he killed
all those people?

16:28.129 --> 16:30.532
He's been like a father to me.

16:30.566 --> 16:33.335
Although I did turn
my father in.

16:33.369 --> 16:35.737
But he was like
a stranger to me, so...

16:35.771 --> 16:37.038
I can't believe
you'd protect Ed

16:37.072 --> 16:38.874
just because you like him.

16:38.907 --> 16:41.543
-Enough!
-(Mandy gasps)

16:41.577 --> 16:44.179
Mr. Alzate, why are you coming
through the back door?

16:44.212 --> 16:48.083
I didn't want anyone
to know I was here.

16:48.116 --> 16:52.254
-It's time to end this.
-(gasps)

16:53.822 --> 16:57.626
Yeah, I know you've been
snooping around in my life.

16:57.659 --> 16:59.628
I wanted you to hear
the truth from me.

16:59.661 --> 17:02.364
It's a bunch of naked hippies,

17:02.398 --> 17:04.800
and they're alive.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.702
(chuckles)

17:06.735 --> 17:10.238
We were never more alive.

17:10.272 --> 17:12.974
Skinny-dipping in Copper Creek,
all hopped up

17:13.008 --> 17:15.110
on Boone's Farm
and peyote buttons.

17:17.012 --> 17:18.780
But why'd you need
to keep this a secret?

17:18.814 --> 17:20.782
Look at the naked woman
on my shoulders.

17:20.816 --> 17:23.752
Why was everyone naked
in the '70s?

17:23.785 --> 17:25.921
Were clothes that expensive?

17:27.656 --> 17:30.058
Hey, is that Barbra Streisand?

17:30.091 --> 17:31.760
That's right, that's right.

17:31.793 --> 17:33.462
She performed
for presidents and kings,

17:33.495 --> 17:36.398
the biggest star in the world;
she couldn't let that get out.

17:36.432 --> 17:38.900
That's all?

17:38.934 --> 17:41.603
We thought you were
the Leadville Killer.

17:41.637 --> 17:44.105
What? Are you nuts?

17:44.139 --> 17:46.842
Well, you were
acting all strange

17:46.875 --> 17:49.177
about being there in 1972.

17:49.210 --> 17:50.946
Well, I had a lot to hide.

17:50.979 --> 17:54.082
Look, I was... I was buck naked
in the woods with Babs.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.518
You wouldn't want the world
to see Fanny Brice's fanny.

17:56.552 --> 17:57.819
Well, now, what the hell?

17:57.853 --> 17:59.988
Now it's-it's all over now,
so...

18:00.021 --> 18:01.990
The carbon paper's out
of the mimeograph,

18:02.023 --> 18:03.325
so share it with the world.

18:03.359 --> 18:04.593
-Fine.
-Yeah.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.496
That's okay, Mr. Alzate.
You take it.

18:07.529 --> 18:09.130
We'll never tell anyone.

18:09.164 --> 18:12.801
In fact, we wish
we could unsee it.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.337
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:15.371 --> 18:16.872
Let's just hope
no one sees the tape

18:16.905 --> 18:19.140
of me and Madeleine Albright.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.179
Can't believe you fixed that
with a pair of pliers.

18:24.212 --> 18:26.848
Well, we all have
our skills, right?

18:26.882 --> 18:28.817
For instance,
you'll be able to save us

18:28.850 --> 18:32.388
if we're ever stuck on the side
of the road and we need a rug.

18:32.421 --> 18:35.056
All right, listen. Hey, Boyd.

18:35.090 --> 18:36.692
Boyd. Boyd, take those out
for a second.

18:36.725 --> 18:38.193
-Yeah, Grandpa?
-Listen.

18:38.226 --> 18:41.530
Does it bother you
when your dad and I argue?

18:41.563 --> 18:44.500
-I-I don't know. Kind of.
-Well, you know we're just

18:44.533 --> 18:45.701
doing it because we have
difference of opinion.

18:45.734 --> 18:46.868
-That's all this is about.
-RYAN: Yeah.

18:46.902 --> 18:48.236
Right, like Grandpa lives
in a world

18:48.269 --> 18:49.705
where the Earth won't die

18:49.738 --> 18:51.640
if the corporations could just
make more money.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.375
And your dad lives
in a world where he thinks

18:53.409 --> 18:57.045
everything would be better if we
just held hands a little longer.

18:57.078 --> 18:59.515
So, just because you fight
doesn't mean

18:59.548 --> 19:01.383
-we won't do stuff together?
-No, no, no, no.

19:01.417 --> 19:03.018
We like to fight. Right, Bozo?

19:03.051 --> 19:04.553
Yeah, we do, Mike.

19:04.586 --> 19:07.423
That's your father
taking the high road.

19:07.456 --> 19:08.724
The important thing is

19:08.757 --> 19:12.494
I will always want to see you.

19:12.528 --> 19:15.363
And I will make sure
that he always does.

19:15.397 --> 19:17.198
So, are we going home?

19:17.232 --> 19:19.501
No, we're not going home.
We're gonna go to the hotel

19:19.535 --> 19:21.169
and the balloon race tomorrow.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.539
We'll get there quicker
if I drive, so get out.

19:23.572 --> 19:25.707
I want to see
how this old crate drives.

19:25.741 --> 19:27.242
Uh, Ruth.

19:27.275 --> 19:28.877
Ruth?

19:28.910 --> 19:30.345
Ruth.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.180
I call my car
Ruth Motor Ginsburg.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.115
I'm sure you do.

19:34.149 --> 19:35.751
You know, I think
I have a picture

19:35.784 --> 19:37.252
in my office of Ed with her.

19:42.958 --> 19:44.392
(typing)

19:44.426 --> 19:46.795
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

19:46.828 --> 19:50.298
where we say, "Give your kid
a fish, he'll eat for a day.

19:50.331 --> 19:52.734
"Teach your kid how to fish,
he'll have an excuse

19:52.768 --> 19:56.037
to flee the house
for a lifetime."

19:56.071 --> 19:59.040
You see, we have a pole model
to help you be

19:59.074 --> 20:01.977
a good role model.

20:02.010 --> 20:05.113
Listen, of course, in life,
no matter how fine of example

20:05.146 --> 20:07.783
you set, there's no guarantee
your kid's gonna follow it.

20:07.816 --> 20:10.251
Even the great Ronald Reagan
had one kid

20:10.285 --> 20:12.954
that turned out to be
a little "wonky."

20:14.189 --> 20:15.624
On the other hand,
some people have

20:15.657 --> 20:17.726
lousy role models
and turn out fine.

20:17.759 --> 20:21.162
Gerald Ford's biological father
was a terrible parent,

20:21.196 --> 20:23.398
but Jerry became president
and, more importantly,

20:23.431 --> 20:25.634
led Michigan football
to two national titles.

20:25.667 --> 20:28.236
Go Blue!
Yeah.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.506
Everyone reacts
to their role models.

20:30.539 --> 20:32.508
My old man used to blow
Pall Mall in your face

20:32.541 --> 20:34.242
to let you know
he was done listening.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.410
(sharp inhale, heavy exhale)

20:35.443 --> 20:36.678
"We're done here, kid."

20:36.712 --> 20:38.313
(blows)

20:38.346 --> 20:39.915
Made me hate cigarettes.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.751
Made my brother Jimmy
a Pall Mall man for life.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.653
Kids are tough and resilient.

20:44.686 --> 20:46.955
And the more time
they spend outdoors,

20:46.988 --> 20:49.357
the tougher and more resilient
they'll be.

20:49.390 --> 20:51.527
That's the real deal.
(chuckles)

20:51.560 --> 20:54.596
Speaking of "reel deals,"

20:54.630 --> 20:57.198
you don't want to send them
out there with bad equipment.

20:57.232 --> 20:58.667
And where would you get
good equipment?

20:58.700 --> 21:00.201
Outdoor Man.

21:00.235 --> 21:03.071
We got all the "reel deals"
your family needs.

21:06.708 --> 21:08.510
Baxter out.

21:10.011 --> 21:11.479
(chicken clucks)

21:11.513 --> 21:13.515
