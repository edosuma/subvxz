WEBVTT

00:11.136 --> 00:12.470
[crowd chattering]

00:16.850 --> 00:19.853
[Ava's voice] "I want to live."
That's God's honest truth.

00:20.478 --> 00:23.314
I don't owe anything
to a bunch of holier-than-thou nuns.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.066
Life's unfair, ladies.

00:25.608 --> 00:26.609
Take it from me.

00:27.485 --> 00:28.695
I'm going back to my friends,

00:28.778 --> 00:31.031
and I'm going to live
the hell out of this life.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.075
I'm going to swim and eat
and kiss and dance

00:34.159 --> 00:36.244
and maybe even make love to, well...

00:36.870 --> 00:37.787
someone.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.205
Eventually.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.709
Speaking of which...

00:43.460 --> 00:45.211
Temptation awaits.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.255
[wind gusting]

00:47.338 --> 00:49.257
[Ava's voice]
Why am I cold all of a sudden?

00:53.219 --> 00:54.137
Oh, no.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.681
Don't stop. Don't look.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.934
Just a girl walking home
after a tough night.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.436
Alone.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.647
Nothing to see here... except...

01:04.731 --> 01:09.903
[air hissing]

01:09.986 --> 01:11.696
[Ava's voice] No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:13.323 --> 01:15.742
Ignore it. No one's asking for a hero.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.869
That's not the life I chose.

01:20.705 --> 01:21.790
[whispers] Goddamn it!

01:29.839 --> 01:31.091
[man speaking in Spanish]

01:31.174 --> 01:32.300
[woman speaking Spanish]

01:34.219 --> 01:35.053
Hey!

01:35.136 --> 01:35.970
[speaking Spanish]

01:36.846 --> 01:37.722
[both grunting]

01:37.806 --> 01:38.681
[thuds]

01:38.765 --> 01:42.477
-[blows thudding]
-[Ava grunting]

01:44.145 --> 01:45.772
-[blows continued thudding]
-[man grunting]

01:45.855 --> 01:48.525
-[woman shouts in Spanish]
-[Ava and man groaning]

01:48.608 --> 01:50.193

-[Ava continues grunting]

01:50.944 --> 01:53.238

-[woman speaking Spanish]

01:54.948 --> 01:56.741
-Wait! Stop! [screams]
-[stabs]

01:56.825 --> 01:58.618
[Ava groaning]

01:59.828 --> 02:01.454
[gasping]

02:03.832 --> 02:05.333
-[shouts in Spanish]
-[Ava grunts]

02:05.416 --> 02:07.627
[footsteps running away]

02:07.710 --> 02:08.878
[woman shouts indistinctly]

02:08.962 --> 02:12.632
[Ava wailing]

02:12.715 --> 02:14.634
[Ava's voice]
See what you get for being a hero?

02:22.016 --> 02:22.892
Mom?

02:24.102 --> 02:24.978
Mom!

02:26.396 --> 02:27.355
Mommy?

02:28.356 --> 02:29.816
What's happening?

02:30.942 --> 02:32.944
Why can't I move my body?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.405
Hush, little lamb.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.033
You've been in a car accident.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.077
Your mother is gone.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.372
But you're a very lucky little girl.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.417
You're in my care now.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.298
[whooshing]

02:53.381 --> 02:55.383
[women vocalizing]

02:55.466 --> 02:57.093
[grinding snarls]

02:58.636 --> 03:01.681
[high-pitched ringing]

03:06.060 --> 03:07.061
[waves crashing]

03:11.983 --> 03:14.819
[birds squawking]

03:21.951 --> 03:23.077
[Ava's voice] I'm not lost.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.913
Just taking the scenic route.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.042
I know it's around here somewhere.

03:41.721 --> 03:42.555
[JC] Ava!

03:43.431 --> 03:44.265
Ava, stop!

03:44.349 --> 03:46.517
JC? [laughs]

03:48.394 --> 03:49.687
[JC] You're fast. What the hell?

03:49.771 --> 03:52.148
What the hell, you?
I was on my way to find you.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.943
Yeah, the homeowners came back.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.361
So, we had to bolt.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.113
Holy shit! What happened?

03:59.197 --> 04:00.156
-Oh--
-Are you hurt?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.699
No, no, no. I'm fine, really.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.035
You should see the other girl. [chuckles]

04:04.869 --> 04:06.621
She's essentially fine, by the way.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.332
So, where is everybody?

04:10.166 --> 04:11.042
Uh...

04:11.501 --> 04:12.418
I'll take you.

04:12.835 --> 04:13.962
Okay. Let's go.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.673
-Oh, yeah.
-It's...

04:24.180 --> 04:26.307
So, Romeo finds his Rosaline.

04:27.183 --> 04:30.645
You know, this sad dope's been going
on and on about you since you disappea--

04:31.688 --> 04:33.064
Good Lord, girl! What is that?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.525
Uh... uh...

04:35.608 --> 04:36.985
My time of the month?

04:37.652 --> 04:39.320
Looks like your time of the year.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.865
Hand her to me, Romeo.
I'll find Carrie a prom dress.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.993
-Oh...
-[whispers] It's all good.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.911
[Chanel] Girl, the shit you get into.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.792
[pop music playing faintly]

04:52.875 --> 04:55.169
[Ava] This view is freakin' incredible.

04:56.045 --> 04:59.090
And the wife has some expensive,
eclectic tastes.

05:00.508 --> 05:03.511
Let's see what we can find you
that won't embarrass the rest of us.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.514
Oh, what about this one?

05:08.725 --> 05:10.101
[Chanel] Absolutely not.

05:11.102 --> 05:11.978
Why not?

05:12.437 --> 05:13.438
I'm sure it could work.

05:13.521 --> 05:16.316
That's your problem, doll.
You're too easily satisfied.

05:16.607 --> 05:17.608
[laughs, stammers]

05:17.692 --> 05:19.193
That is so not my problem.

05:20.778 --> 05:24.532
My problem is that I've never had
the chance to pick out my own clothes.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.287
To find my own style,
discover who I really am.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.210
This probably makes no sense to you.
[chuckles]

05:37.962 --> 05:38.921
No.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.760
Actually, it took me a while
to figure out who I was, too.

05:44.719 --> 05:45.803
[Ava] So how do you do it?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.557
How do you choose who you are?

05:51.309 --> 05:55.772
[clicks teeth] The key is to remember
that... your clothes don't define you.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.360
They define your image for the world.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.408
Fashion can be an illusion.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.288
A book jacket,
describing the fun story inside.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.416
You see?

06:16.376 --> 06:17.293
[laughs]

06:18.002 --> 06:18.878
Yeah.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.588
Yeah, I think I do.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.590
All right, then, doll.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.425
[snaps scarf]

06:24.509 --> 06:25.551
Let's find you.

06:29.597 --> 06:30.431
[chuckles]

06:40.108 --> 06:40.942
Wow.

06:41.734 --> 06:42.860
You look, uh...

06:46.114 --> 06:47.031
perfect.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.491
You're welcome.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.203
Hey, we picked up some supplies.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.247
The fuck is she doing here?

06:55.039 --> 06:55.957
You didn't tell her?

06:57.500 --> 06:58.459
Tell me what?

06:59.377 --> 07:01.754
Yeah, um, we're moving out.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.631
Bugging out's more like.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.134
What's that mean?

07:06.926 --> 07:07.885
We had a visitor.

07:07.969 --> 07:08.970
[mocking] A visitor.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.722
We found Jillian Salvius
right here in our fucking home.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.141
It's technically not our home.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.267
Jillian Salvius?

07:14.725 --> 07:16.394
Yeah. She was looking for you.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.396
What? Why?

07:19.230 --> 07:20.440
She didn't mention.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.067
Somehow, she figured out
we were at the party together,

07:23.151 --> 07:24.694
so she came here to threaten us.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.237
Now, we've gotta fly.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.406
Thanks.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.366
Zori, back off.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.201
Well, let's just go then.

07:33.077 --> 07:36.205
-Disappear, hit the next town.
-Are you deaf and fashion-crippled?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.748
Hey, easy now.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.417
I prefer fashion-disabled.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.837
You brought the heat down on us, chica.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.006
You're radioactive.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.800
[Ava] I'm sorry, I didn't...

07:49.051 --> 07:49.927
Listen...

07:51.137 --> 07:52.889
you're my only friends right now.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.057
You're the only people I know.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.478
We're leaving.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.022
And you are going to disappear.

08:01.105 --> 08:02.982
Zori, enough! Okay?

08:03.900 --> 08:06.152
What did we say
when we started all this, huh?

08:06.527 --> 08:07.820
"We're in it together," remember?

08:08.362 --> 08:09.280
[Zori] I remember.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.116
We said it right before
Little Miss Spotlight showed up.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.869
We also promised not to take stupid risks,

08:15.328 --> 08:16.496
to never get caught.

08:17.371 --> 08:19.499
We had a good thing going here, JC.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.710
You fucked it up by bringing her in.
Now you bring her back here?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.253
How stupid are you?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.713
-Stop! Stop it!
-[buzz ringing]

08:25.796 --> 08:27.215
Stay out of this, you weirdo bitch!

08:27.298 --> 08:28.466
Do not talk to her like that!

08:28.549 --> 08:30.218
-I said stop!
-[high-pitched blast]

08:30.301 --> 08:32.845
[debris clattering]

08:33.846 --> 08:34.805
I'm sorry.

08:38.809 --> 08:39.769
[JC] Ava!

08:41.103 --> 08:42.647
[Jillian] All right. One more time.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.775
[beeping, whirring]

08:45.858 --> 08:47.735
[high-pitched ringing]

08:47.818 --> 08:49.737
Any luck recreating the effect?

08:49.820 --> 08:51.030
[whirring, rattling]

08:51.113 --> 08:52.031
No.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.283
Any sign of the girl?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.285
Our people are searching the city.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.872
But... we did find Blair Macready...

09:01.082 --> 09:02.416
at the bottom of a quarry.

09:06.712 --> 09:07.588
Jesus.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.132
Don't worry.
We do have the situation contained.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.717
[scoffs] Contained?

09:12.552 --> 09:15.304
You think Cardinal Duretti
is going to stop at Macready?

09:17.431 --> 09:19.517
The Church has been killing heretics
for centuries.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.476
You know that.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.727
I also know Duretti.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.814
He's desperately protective
of his reputation.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.023
And his religion.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.734
He thinks I'm going to open
a portal to Heaven

09:28.818 --> 09:30.069
and steal their business.

09:30.152 --> 09:33.864
My point is, if you oppose them openly,

09:35.491 --> 09:37.118
you could find yourself at war.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.665
Looks a lot like war already.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.006
[Superion]
Father, the Vatican is watching.

09:50.715 --> 09:54.969
Yes, we can limp on, but without the Halo,
we are effectively neutralized.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.304
Ava will come back.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.556
-You can't know that.
-But I can have faith.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.474
[Duretti] Vincent.

10:00.933 --> 10:01.934
Mother Superion.

10:02.351 --> 10:03.811
May I have a word?

10:03.894 --> 10:06.522
Cardinal Duretti, please join us.

10:08.357 --> 10:11.527
I trust you're squared away
for your return to Rome?

10:13.154 --> 10:14.739
My orders have changed.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.157
Please have a seat.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.958
Given the difficulties we are facing,

10:26.042 --> 10:28.419
I have decided to postpone my return.

10:29.378 --> 10:32.673
For the time being, I will remain here
in an oversight capacity.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.425
May I ask why?

10:34.967 --> 10:38.054
To determine what it might take
to save this operation.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.142
I wasn't aware we needed saving.

10:43.225 --> 10:44.852
Sister Shannon is dead.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.230
You have failed to bring
the new Warrior Nun to heel.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.233
You have lost the sacred Halo.

10:52.276 --> 10:56.364
Father Vincent, how would you characterize
our current status?

10:58.157 --> 10:59.992
As a period of transition.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.327
How euphemistic.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.955
We've faced grave trials before.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.207
We'll face them again.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.375
Father Vincent,

11:08.292 --> 11:12.630
need I remind you that the Cardinal
retains ultimate oversight of our Order?

11:12.713 --> 11:17.009
I merely wished to point out that
oversight is not the same as management.

11:17.093 --> 11:21.931
The fact is this operation
has fallen to its lowest point in decades.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.892
I'm afraid I must agree.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.729
Mother Superion, we go back many years.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.858
We have experienced many trials together.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.362
Please attempt to convince your colleague

11:36.445 --> 11:38.406
that I am fighting desperately

11:38.489 --> 11:40.282
to keep this sacred mission alive.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.035
And I am the only ally you've got.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.040
[Ava's voice] You've lost your friends
and betrayed the nuns

11:48.124 --> 11:49.500
who brought you back from the dead.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.252
Impressive stuff, kid.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.131
I should just go.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.550
Skip town. Find a job.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.220
[distant bells ringing]

12:02.388 --> 12:03.556
[Ava's voice] Make a new life.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.684
New friends.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.062
What's keeping me here, anyway?

12:13.649 --> 12:14.692
[nun groans]

12:15.818 --> 12:17.194
You're a woman now.

12:19.613 --> 12:24.702
So, could you at least try to be anything
but a burden to everyone around you?

12:27.621 --> 12:29.331
But I am trying, Sister Frances.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.293
Look what I taught myself to do.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.089
Sure, what's the use of that?

12:38.174 --> 12:42.803
Well, you know your little joke
on how I never lift a finger around here?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.566
[sighs]

12:56.567 --> 12:58.027
It's the little victories.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.822
[bell ringing]

13:09.872 --> 13:10.998
[Ava] What do you want?

13:12.082 --> 13:13.626
I wanted to know how you're doing.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.005
I'm... getting by.

13:22.384 --> 13:25.262
Well, you've managed to rattle Zori.

13:25.679 --> 13:26.972
I've never seen that before.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.268
It's the little victories. [laughs]

13:35.439 --> 13:37.483
Any idea why Salvius could be after you?

13:38.692 --> 13:40.152
I have a vague suspicion.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.115
Do you want to talk about it?

13:48.077 --> 13:48.953
No.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.165
Zori's right.

13:54.583 --> 13:55.501
I have to go.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.589
I'm sorry I fucked things up
for you and your friends.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.638
It was really nice knowing you.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.017
Hey, can I go with you?

14:15.437 --> 14:16.939
What about your gang?

14:18.232 --> 14:20.693
I think we might have come
to the end of our road.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.611
[distant ship horn blaring]

14:22.695 --> 14:24.321
[JC] Those aren't real friends.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.950
They're... partners to back you in a scam.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.162
People you boost a couple of beers with,
have a few laughs.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.456
[Ava's voice] Why is he doing this?

14:34.707 --> 14:35.791
Just to be nice?

14:36.333 --> 14:37.960
Is he rescuing me again?

14:40.045 --> 14:42.298
You're probably just buying more trouble,
you know.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.383
When you say trouble, I hear adventure.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.555
[laughs]

14:50.890 --> 14:54.268
So what?
We just hop on a ferry and go where?

14:55.311 --> 14:56.270
Where we want.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.983
[Ava's voice]
I'd rather be rescued than alone.

15:01.984 --> 15:02.818
Okay.

15:04.820 --> 15:05.654
Let's go.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.121
[car starts]

15:17.166 --> 15:20.377
[Duretti praying in Italian]

15:26.175 --> 15:27.009
Amen.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.094
[choir singing liturgical music]

15:41.649 --> 15:44.485
Sisters, we are at war.

15:45.444 --> 15:49.114
The Lord, in His wisdom,
has widened the scope of our directive.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.491
[nuns murmur]

15:50.574 --> 15:52.618
[Duretti]
But I recently saw Dr. Salvius...

15:53.410 --> 15:55.996
in possession of a Divinium-plated device.

15:57.539 --> 16:02.127
I suspect that she's melting down pieces
of the Holy Armor in her lab.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.089
This is blasphemy.

16:06.715 --> 16:10.844
The Church will not see the destruction
of our sacred relics...

16:11.679 --> 16:14.181
for the personal enrichment of a heretic.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.766
[whispers] Where's Father Vincent?

16:15.849 --> 16:17.851
[whispers]
Why is the Cardinal taking over?

16:17.935 --> 16:19.478
[whispers] What difference does it make?

16:20.354 --> 16:21.313
Quiet.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.149
It is imperative
that we bring these artifacts

16:24.233 --> 16:26.360
into our possession immediately.

16:43.627 --> 16:44.628
[sighs]

17:07.943 --> 17:08.777
[grunts]

17:11.613 --> 17:14.616
[panting]

17:27.755 --> 17:30.007
[crying]

17:50.819 --> 17:51.820
[scratches]

18:06.126 --> 18:08.128
[birds twittering]

18:12.091 --> 18:13.133
Your Eminence.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.177
Sister Lilith.

18:16.678 --> 18:20.224
Your family has served this order
faithfully since the 1500s,

18:20.766 --> 18:22.935
providing six Halo-Bearers.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.813
An impressive lineage.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.526
But it must have been hard on you,
that legacy.

18:30.609 --> 18:31.944
Those expectations.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.447
And then to have your destiny
so rudely snatched away.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.909
I accept the path before me.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.619
As do I.

18:43.622 --> 18:48.544
But I would suggest there is a difference
between... meekly accepting one's path

18:49.169 --> 18:50.921
and correcting a grave mistake.

18:52.798 --> 18:57.261
Perhaps even a dire sin may be forgiven
in the pursuit of the greater good.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.179
Wouldn't you agree?

19:00.556 --> 19:01.473
I would.

19:02.766 --> 19:03.725
Sister Lilith,

19:05.102 --> 19:07.354
if I may trust you

19:07.437 --> 19:09.690
to keep this conversation
strictly between us.

19:17.072 --> 19:20.117
The OCS is under intense scrutiny
from the Vatican.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.578
We must get our house in order.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.289
How might I help?

19:26.623 --> 19:27.875
Track down the girl.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.420
Bring the Halo back into our possession.

19:32.754 --> 19:33.672
I'll find her,

19:34.548 --> 19:36.717
but she'll never come back with me.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.468
Not willingly.

19:40.387 --> 19:44.474
Then I would suggest
that her lack of loyalty...

19:45.309 --> 19:46.977
is a betrayal to the Halo itself.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.481
Perhaps our Order can only be restored...

19:52.149 --> 19:53.358
by a new Halo-Bearer.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.154
The proper Halo-Bearer.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.627
[glass shatters]

20:18.258 --> 20:19.134
Father?

20:20.510 --> 20:21.386
Mary.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.473
I dropped my tea.

20:25.933 --> 20:26.892
I saw.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.188
What can I do for you?

20:33.023 --> 20:34.566
I have a confession to make.

20:38.654 --> 20:39.655
I'm all ears.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.032
No, I mean...

20:45.118 --> 20:47.246
Yes, of course.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.421
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.174
It has been...

21:01.051 --> 21:02.761
Well, you know how long it's been.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.183
May the Lord be in your heart

21:08.267 --> 21:11.186
and help you to confess your sins
with true sorrow.

21:12.562 --> 21:13.897
I feel no sorrow.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.401
I killed a man who was gonna kill me.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.154
Then your conscience is clear.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.448
My conscience was never the issue.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.244
And here's what we know.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.747
Someone targeted Shannon directly.

21:31.957 --> 21:35.002
And that means whoever did it
knew Divinium could kill her,

21:35.961 --> 21:38.338
and they had enough of it
to rig the explosion.

21:39.923 --> 21:44.303
And now Cardinal Duretti tells us
that Salvius has been collecting

21:44.386 --> 21:45.637
and studying Divinium.

21:46.054 --> 21:47.306
Exactly.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.059
Mary...

21:52.477 --> 21:55.314
I know you and Shannon were close,

21:55.939 --> 21:58.275
but you mustn't let anger
cloud your judgment.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.818
I found this in her room.

22:08.952 --> 22:10.078
Part of her habit.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.080
Embedded in the wall.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.752
How could there be a hidden room
in her chambers?

22:17.711 --> 22:18.962
It's possible.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.299
This old place has endless secrets.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.636
So, if Shannon had knowledge
that endangered her life,

22:28.180 --> 22:32.100
wouldn't it make sense that she would
keep it somewhere only she could find it?

22:33.018 --> 22:35.437
A room she'd have to phase into.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.356
I'm knocking down that wall.

22:37.856 --> 22:38.815
[Vicent] No.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.359
If Shannon was murdered,

22:41.318 --> 22:44.112
we can't risk drawing unwanted attention.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.742
We need Ava to phase into the room.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.578
[Mary] Any idea where to find her?

22:54.498 --> 22:56.458
I suggest we ask a friend of hers.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.754
[spits]

23:01.046 --> 23:03.215
[nun] Ungrateful little pig!

23:04.049 --> 23:07.719
Do you not know there's children starving
all over the world?

23:08.178 --> 23:10.305
They probably had nuns
cooking their meals.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.933
[Diego and Ava laughing]

23:13.934 --> 23:15.602
[nun] Your birthday is coming up.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.021
Ooh, I want a motorcycle.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.189
And skis!

23:19.272 --> 23:22.484
[gasps] Oh, yeah, Jet Skis!
Oh, mental high five!

23:23.151 --> 23:25.153
[both laughing]

23:25.237 --> 23:28.865
[nun] Soon, next month,
you'll age out of here.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.834
A poor, crippled girl out on the street.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.921
No money, and no way to make it.

23:44.631 --> 23:47.884
What will become of you without me?

24:02.607 --> 24:03.525
Are you all right?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.280
It's going to be strange, leaving.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.449
I've been here so long.

24:11.616 --> 24:12.784
How'd you end up here?

24:14.161 --> 24:15.078
Spain?

24:16.788 --> 24:17.747
That's a...

24:19.207 --> 24:20.167
A long story?

24:21.543 --> 24:23.378
Short and unpleasant.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.047
How about you?

24:27.924 --> 24:30.469
Well, after my mom died,

24:30.552 --> 24:32.554
I was supposed to go to university,

24:33.263 --> 24:36.641
but... I figured the college fund
they'd scraped together

24:36.725 --> 24:38.560
should go towards her medical bills.

24:40.103 --> 24:43.148
I just didn't care anymore about anything.

24:43.648 --> 24:46.985
So, I lifted a businessman's wallet

24:47.068 --> 24:49.446
and a pack of gum
in the shuttle to the airport.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.031
I went inside,

24:51.615 --> 24:55.702
and I whipped the gum
at the big board of airline destinations.

24:55.785 --> 24:56.786
It hit Geneva,

24:57.370 --> 24:59.831
and I bought a first-class ticket
with the guy's gold card.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.041
[laughs]

25:01.583 --> 25:02.667
Oh, my God.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.462
What if it had hit,
like, Florida or something?

25:06.963 --> 25:08.006
I had more gum.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.636
Anyway, so I landed in Geneva,

25:13.220 --> 25:15.055
took the train into the Alps
for the ski season,

25:15.138 --> 25:17.599
and that's where I met Zori and Chanel.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.977
Um, we picked up Randall in Amsterdam.

25:22.437 --> 25:24.940
That was about 18 months ago.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.067
Yeah.

25:30.153 --> 25:32.531
So, come on. Your turn.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.450
Tell me Ava's story.

25:38.411 --> 25:39.329
Not yet.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.624
I'm still figuring it out.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.670
[wind gusting]

25:53.260 --> 25:54.344
[Beatrice] West door.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.513
Looks optimal.

25:57.013 --> 25:58.848
That's, what, two and a half meters?

25:59.516 --> 26:01.768
We need to clear three meters,
or we'll fry.

26:01.851 --> 26:03.603
Not a problem. Let's go!

26:06.523 --> 26:08.024
What are we waiting for, Bea?

26:08.108 --> 26:09.192
Shift change.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.278
Patience.

26:13.196 --> 26:14.072
Fine.

26:14.155 --> 26:16.157
[indistinct chatter in distance]

26:18.243 --> 26:19.536
I can have patience.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.247
I can be calm.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.294
Come on, you stupid shift change!

26:32.924 --> 26:34.134
[sighs]

26:35.051 --> 26:36.177
[Beatrice] Don't be nervous.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.597
You'll do well tonight.

26:39.806 --> 26:40.765
It's not that.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.518
It's more that...

26:44.936 --> 26:48.857
I'm just surprised the Cardinal sent us
to break into a private business.

26:50.483 --> 26:53.111
I know it's for Divinium and all,
but I'm...

26:54.404 --> 26:55.405
just surp--

26:56.114 --> 26:59.034
It's just not what
I was expected to be doing.

26:59.909 --> 27:00.744
Yes.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.456
It seems like he's changing
the agenda of the OCS.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.001
It's his agenda to change.

27:09.169 --> 27:12.547
And if Jillian Salvius is
melting down the Armor of Adriel,

27:13.131 --> 27:14.299
that is a blasphemy.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.053
[Beatrice]
Still, we're taking a risk here.

27:19.429 --> 27:22.223
We could expose our sect, and for what?

27:22.766 --> 27:24.601
For the protection of our interests.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.978
Which interests, Lilith?

27:29.230 --> 27:32.108
I noticed you were speaking
with the Cardinal alone...

27:32.901 --> 27:33.985
before we left.

27:37.947 --> 27:39.574
Careful around this one, Camila.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.368
She'll pry into all your business.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.245
Only when it affects our business.

27:47.916 --> 27:48.833
Does it?

27:57.008 --> 27:58.218
Guards will be moving.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.594
Let's go.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.305
[Beatrice] In this life, or the next.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.807
[all] In this life, or the next.

28:14.901 --> 28:17.696
[nuns panting, grunting]

28:18.238 --> 28:21.825
[JC] Where do you want to go?
Casablanca? Tangiers?

28:21.908 --> 28:24.035
Wow. We can lay low in Marrakesh.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.287
I actually know a French dude
who can get you a passport.

28:26.371 --> 28:29.082
[Ava's voice] Endless possibilities
for the first time in my life,

28:29.165 --> 28:31.042
and a blazing hot guy by my side.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.920
So why can't I leave?

28:35.380 --> 28:36.923
Because something's wrong.

28:37.006 --> 28:38.299
Something's unfinished.

28:39.801 --> 28:40.635
[JC] What?

28:41.678 --> 28:44.472
Something you said
about leaving your friends.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.725
[JC] I thought
you didn't have any friends here.

28:47.308 --> 28:48.309
No, I have one.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.270
He's...

28:50.353 --> 28:53.064
He's getting worse. Poor little lamb.

A poor, crippled girl out on the street.

28:58.027 --> 29:00.029
What will become of you without me?

29:01.239 --> 29:02.991
I know you killed yourself.

29:06.870 --> 29:07.996
[whispers] Oh, my God.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.165
Ava, what's wrong?

29:18.465 --> 29:20.133
Hey. What's going on?

29:20.216 --> 29:21.217
Aren't we leaving?

29:21.301 --> 29:23.386
Yes. Grab some tickets.
It doesn't matter where.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.304
I trust you, okay?

29:24.387 --> 29:25.597
Where are you going?

29:26.639 --> 29:29.267
I have to check in on a friend.
He may need my help.

29:29.350 --> 29:30.560
I'll be back. I promise!

29:31.770 --> 29:32.937

30:28.868 --> 30:30.286
You can't be in here.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.749
Look, I don't want to hurt you.

30:35.124 --> 30:36.543

31:11.786 --> 31:14.247
The Cardinal said the artifacts
would be in the labs.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.373
Where'd they go?

31:15.456 --> 31:16.583
Through there, maybe.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.172

Take the others and go.

31:45.778 --> 31:46.654
What about you?

31:46.738 --> 31:48.406
I'll meet you back at the Cat's Cradle.

Stop.

Who are you?

Get out!

34:56.552 --> 34:57.845
Who do you think you are?

34:58.971 --> 35:00.890
Just a poor, crippled girl...

35:02.266 --> 35:03.684
back from the streets.

35:08.439 --> 35:09.315
Ava.

35:12.401 --> 35:13.319
But you died.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.488
Yes, I did.

35:17.406 --> 35:18.658
You killed me.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.495
I cared for you.

35:23.871 --> 35:26.374
I sacrificed my life for you.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.209
Until the day
I was aging out of the system.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.044
So you put me out of my misery.

35:33.339 --> 35:37.009
You're a devil, sent from Hell.

35:37.093 --> 35:39.053
No, Frances.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.181
You're the devil here.

35:43.724 --> 35:44.809
[voice breaking] How many?

35:45.601 --> 35:47.228
How many have you killed?

35:47.687 --> 35:49.814
I lost count over the years.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.111
So many souls.

35:56.070 --> 35:58.406
[crying] So much pain.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.577
You're a murderer!

No!

36:05.663 --> 36:06.664
I'm a savior.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.126
I released them from their pain.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.963
I released them into the arms of God.

36:16.799 --> 36:19.010
I freed their souls.

Give me the syringe, Frances.

I'm so sorry you had to see that.

Are you okay?

37:30.748 --> 37:31.958
[Diego] You're an angel.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.002
No.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.179
You'll be okay now. All right?

37:45.263 --> 37:48.349
All right? Now let's take you
to Sister Emilene,

37:48.432 --> 37:50.059
and she'll take good care of you, come on.

37:50.142 --> 37:51.352
No, just go.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.896
Just go before you get in trouble.

37:55.731 --> 37:57.108
[Ava] I'll miss you, Diego.

37:57.191 --> 37:58.734
I'll see you again, in Heaven.

38:20.339 --> 38:21.799
How the hell did this happen?

38:22.800 --> 38:24.010
[man] It was a nun.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.762
A very fast nun.

We've got the footage.

I tried to warn you.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.035
Without the Shield,
I can't finish the machine.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.579
I'll send a team to search the city.

38:51.662 --> 38:52.872
Oh, no.

38:53.497 --> 38:54.582
Not our men.

38:55.249 --> 38:58.085
I want you to buy out
Macready's operation under an alias.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.588
You're taking on
a private security company?

39:00.671 --> 39:04.759
Well, given the fact that our current team
has been taken out by what appears to be

39:04.842 --> 39:07.053
a petite member of the clergy,

39:07.136 --> 39:09.388
it strikes me
they may not be up to the task.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.059
And like you said...

39:15.311 --> 39:17.980
the Church and I are at war.

39:21.484 --> 39:26.489
[choir singing liturgical music]

39:28.783 --> 39:30.242
The Shield of Faith.

39:32.411 --> 39:34.413
There must have been other artifacts.

39:35.247 --> 39:36.999
She's melted the rest of them down.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.459
Into what?

39:39.001 --> 39:40.294
Some sort of device.

39:40.795 --> 39:43.297
A circle, about two meters in diameter,

39:43.381 --> 39:45.174
connected to power generators,

39:45.800 --> 39:47.009
computer systems.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.637
The first ring was just a prototype.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.348
It was unfinished.

39:53.182 --> 39:56.143
I believe Dr. Salvius needs
the Divinium content of the Shield

39:56.227 --> 39:57.061
to complete it.

39:57.144 --> 40:00.398
She seems to be applying technology
in an attempt to...

40:01.357 --> 40:02.983
activate the Divinium somehow.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.111
Activate it to do what?

40:06.112 --> 40:07.947
To open the gates of Hell.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.037
[Ava sobbing]

40:15.121 --> 40:16.372
[Ava's voice] I killed Frances.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.208
Killer. Murderer.

40:22.044 --> 40:23.796
No! It was self-defense.

40:23.879 --> 40:24.964
She poisoned me.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.174
Tried to kill me again.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.639
She was gonna kill Diego, and I saved him.

40:34.056 --> 40:35.850
So maybe it all balances out.

40:36.725 --> 40:37.601
Maybe.

I've been looking for you.

41:24.356 --> 41:25.357
I told you.

41:25.816 --> 41:27.067
I'm not going back.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.069
It's all right.

41:36.952 --> 41:38.871
I only need a part of you.
