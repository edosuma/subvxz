WEBVTT

00:01.176 --> 00:02.499
[Archer]
Because she's two, Lana!

00:02.619 --> 00:03.952
What possible difference
could it make,

00:04.154 --> 00:06.171
what pre-pre-school
she goes to?

00:06.373 --> 00:08.990
Because if A.J. gets
into pre-pre at Country Day,

00:09.110 --> 00:10.409
she's set through eighth grade.

00:10.611 --> 00:11.811
Then she's basically
guaranteed a slot

00:12.013 --> 00:13.245
at any prep school in L.A.!

00:13.448 --> 00:14.714
Yeah, but why prep school?

00:14.916 --> 00:16.282
Are we not even
considering public school?

00:16.484 --> 00:17.484
Seriously?

00:17.618 --> 00:19.285
Why not?
And in summertime,

00:19.487 --> 00:20.953
instead of a lemonade stand,

00:21.155 --> 00:23.422
she could have a teeny little
stripper pole, and--

00:23.624 --> 00:24.291
Malory!
Mother!

00:24.412 --> 00:25.878
Public school.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.313
Might as well leave her by a
dumpster at the county fair

00:28.516 --> 00:29.948
and hope she's taken in by carnies.

00:30.151 --> 00:31.850
Wow.
Yeah, Mother, good call,

00:32.052 --> 00:33.293
I didn't know we were drinking.

00:33.421 --> 00:34.953
We're not.
Because Country Day

00:35.156 --> 00:38.190
gets a thousand applicants
for ten spaces in pre-pre.

00:38.392 --> 00:40.459
Please stop saying "pre-pre."
Shut up.

00:40.661 --> 00:42.461
And A.J. is going to get
one of those spaces,

00:42.663 --> 00:44.897
and you're not gonna screw
this up for her, Archer!

00:45.099 --> 00:47.332
[man]
Archer? Swirling Archer?

00:47.535 --> 00:48.535
[gasp]

00:51.105 --> 00:52.105
Sterling!
Archer?

00:52.206 --> 00:53.005
[whisper] Ivy.

00:53.207 --> 00:54.773
Dude, it's me! Ivy!

00:54.975 --> 00:55.975
From St. Josh!

00:56.043 --> 00:57.209
Yeah, I, uh --
[laughing]

00:57.411 --> 00:59.244
Long time, no see!

00:59.447 --> 01:01.447
What're you doing here?
Checking out the toilets?

01:01.649 --> 01:04.715
No, I'm-- I mean I'm,
I'm, I'm-- [laughing]

01:04.919 --> 01:07.886
[imitating] Wow, still
got that stammer, huh?

01:08.089 --> 01:10.355
I--
Hello, Richard Stratton the fourth,

01:10.558 --> 01:11.958
though my good friends call me Ivy.

01:12.059 --> 01:13.325
Malory Archer.

01:13.527 --> 01:15.561
Hmm. Sterling never mentioned
a sister.

01:15.763 --> 01:18.697
Oh, you.
I'm actually his mother,

01:18.899 --> 01:19.899
if you can believe it.

01:20.034 --> 01:21.500
I absolutely cannot.

01:21.702 --> 01:25.070
Really? Hi, Lana Kane.
Hello.

01:25.272 --> 01:27.840
So, Mr. Stratton,
are you a teacher here, or...

01:28.042 --> 01:29.441
[chuckling]
Oh, God, no.

01:29.643 --> 01:31.176
No, I'm on the board.

01:31.378 --> 01:33.712
And, Archer, you're in L.A.?
What's your line?

01:33.914 --> 01:36.348
I-- um-- I'm a--
a private investigator?

01:36.550 --> 01:39.952
[laughs]
No, seriously.

01:40.154 --> 01:41.620
No, seriously.

01:41.822 --> 01:42.822
Wow.

01:42.890 --> 01:43.890
[baby cooing]
Oh.

01:43.924 --> 01:46.725
And who might this person be?

01:46.927 --> 01:48.727
This is our daughter, A.J.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.327
We're here for a placement interview.

01:50.394 --> 01:51.929
Our? Um...

01:52.049 --> 01:54.982
Ours. As in mine and Archer's.

02:01.408 --> 02:03.375
Yeah I'm not the maid or the nanny.

02:03.577 --> 02:06.245
Good for you.
Good for you.

02:06.447 --> 02:08.180
Gosh, the times we live in, huh?

02:08.382 --> 02:10.749
So hey, private investigator.

02:10.951 --> 02:12.618
I might actually be able to use you.

02:12.820 --> 02:13.820
Oh, well...
Really?

02:13.988 --> 02:15.787
Unfortunately, I don't think

02:15.990 --> 02:18.423
we're taking on new clients
right now, so-- [chuckles]

02:18.626 --> 02:20.125
May I speak with you
a moment, please?

02:20.327 --> 02:22.761
What is this "no new
clients" bullshit?

02:22.963 --> 02:25.864
He's on the board, Archer.
One word from him, and A.J. is in.

02:26.066 --> 02:27.699
Yeah, but--
Yeah, but shut up!

02:27.902 --> 02:30.035
This is your daughter's future,
you dickhead!

02:30.237 --> 02:32.671
So you are gonna take his case,
and you are gonna solve it,

02:32.873 --> 02:34.273
and A.J.
is going to school here

02:34.475 --> 02:36.275
and then grow up
to be a titan of industry

02:36.477 --> 02:39.244
or an astronaut or some other shit!

02:39.446 --> 02:40.479
[baby cooing]

02:40.681 --> 02:41.980
[sighs]
Well?

02:42.183 --> 02:45.784
[yelps] Yeah, okay,
sure, glad to help.

02:45.986 --> 02:47.586
Outstanding.

Yep.

02:50.057 --> 02:52.858
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

02:53.060 --> 02:57.095
She said, phrasing?
Boom. Huh?

02:57.298 --> 02:58.830
Hey, what's happening?
Are you okay?

Thank you, Cerise.

Ah, Swirling Archer. Remember?

04:03.831 --> 04:05.936
How we always used
to call you Swirling?

04:06.056 --> 04:07.960
Yep.
Because of all the swirlies.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.305
Yep.
We were just merciless.

04:11.164 --> 04:13.454
But I was a pussycat compared to Whitney.
Yup.

04:13.574 --> 04:15.307
Yep.
You remember Trent Whitney, right?

04:15.509 --> 04:18.076
Yep, he was, uh, actually worse.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.245
He's the Whitney
in Stratton-Whitney.

Mm.

You played lacs with him, right?

04:24.118 --> 04:25.317
You were center middies.
Yep.

04:25.519 --> 04:27.085
I was biathlon, obviously.

04:27.288 --> 04:28.848
Probably could've made
the Olympic team,

04:28.922 --> 04:30.756
but whatever, lame.
[chuckles]

04:30.958 --> 04:32.691
And didn't you letter all four years?

04:32.893 --> 04:35.527
No. Just three.
Are you sure?

04:35.729 --> 04:38.030
I am, yeah. Freshman year
I didn't make varsity

04:38.232 --> 04:40.472
because that winter I was
in the hospital for five weeks.

04:40.601 --> 04:42.267
With what, AIDS?
[chuckles]

04:42.469 --> 04:43.469
Pneumonia.
From what?

04:43.637 --> 04:44.736
Complications from AIDS?
[laughing]

04:44.938 --> 04:47.606
No, I actually--
I actually got it

04:47.808 --> 04:50.275
from one of those hilarious swirlies.
Hm?

04:50.477 --> 04:52.811
Yeah, my freshman year,
you two were seniors.

04:53.013 --> 04:54.479
Right before winter break.

04:54.682 --> 04:56.615
<i>[Archer]
Anyway, you each had</i>

04:56.834 --> 04:58.950

and you cornered me</i>

04:59.169 --> 05:02.020

[boys grunting]
[Young Archer] No! No! No! No!

down, over the toilet,</i>

05:07.594 --> 05:09.761

because I look down</i>

05:09.963 --> 05:12.698

Whitney had pissed in it.</i>

05:12.900 --> 05:14.666
<i>So I'm screaming,
and you're both laughing,</i>

05:14.868 --> 05:16.535

05:16.737 --> 05:18.103

05:35.756 --> 05:38.757
[sigh] But long story short, I
didn't make varsity that spring

05:38.959 --> 05:40.892
because I was getting over pneumonia,

05:41.095 --> 05:43.562
which I got because,
during that swirlie,

05:43.764 --> 05:46.164
turns out I aspirated water
in my lungs.

05:47.768 --> 05:49.568
Well, and presumably urine.

05:49.770 --> 05:51.236
[inhales]
Look--

05:51.438 --> 05:54.039
Archer, I want you to kill me.
I'm sorry?

05:54.241 --> 05:55.841
Well, you should be!
Why the hell

05:56.043 --> 05:57.523
would you say that to the headmaster?

05:57.644 --> 05:59.211
I thought he was hinting at it!

05:59.413 --> 06:02.047
Why would you think that?

06:02.249 --> 06:04.750
When someone uses
the term "exclusive"

06:04.952 --> 06:06.585
to describe something,
what are they--

06:06.787 --> 06:07.586
No blacks or Jews.

06:07.788 --> 06:08.920
Wh--
Exactly, so--

06:09.123 --> 06:11.890
Malory, he was Jewish!

06:12.092 --> 06:13.658
That's why I was so confused.

06:13.861 --> 06:15.494
I'm not sure I'm following you.

06:15.696 --> 06:18.163
I'm dying.
Liver cancer, stage four.

06:18.365 --> 06:19.798
I've got maybe three months left,

06:20.000 --> 06:21.680
every minute of which,
the doctors tell me,

06:21.835 --> 06:23.105
I'll spend writhing in agony.

06:23.225 --> 06:24.707
Jesus, Ivy.
Yeah.

06:24.827 --> 06:27.241
Yeah, and honestly
I am too scared to face that.

06:27.361 --> 06:28.726
At first I thought--

06:28.846 --> 06:30.591
but...

06:30.711 --> 06:32.277
What about good old pills and vodka?

06:32.479 --> 06:34.379
Life insurance won't pay out
on a suicide,

06:34.581 --> 06:37.021
and I'm not going to cheat my
wife out of ten million dollars.

06:37.184 --> 06:39.718
No, I guess they--
but I can't, um--

06:39.920 --> 06:42.454
You can, though.
Please, I'm begging you,

06:42.656 --> 06:43.856
don't make me go through that.

06:44.024 --> 06:45.390
Can't you go
to Switzerland, or--

06:45.592 --> 06:46.858
No, no, but you can.

06:47.060 --> 06:48.360
You can open a Swiss account

06:48.562 --> 06:50.082
with the $100,000
I'm going to pay you.

06:50.164 --> 06:52.364
I-- Ivy, I'm not
a hit man, I'm a--

06:52.566 --> 06:54.132

06:54.334 --> 06:56.535
a space at Country Day for his...

06:56.737 --> 06:58.870
I guess, what, mulatto bastard?

06:59.072 --> 07:01.873
[clears throat] I think technically
she's an octoroon bastard,

07:02.075 --> 07:04.843
but our whole parenting
philosophy is sort of, uh,

07:05.045 --> 07:06.511
post-label?
[chuckling]

07:06.713 --> 07:09.214
Yeah, good luck with that.
Yeah, so how do you wanna die?

[clears throat] Home invasion.
You break into my house,

07:11.485 --> 07:12.951
I startle you, you shoot me.

07:13.153 --> 07:14.886
I assume you have access
to a firearm?

07:15.088 --> 07:17.823
I do, yeah-- But you can't
shoot me in the face.

07:18.025 --> 07:19.524
Or the belly.
Or in the legs.

07:19.726 --> 07:21.293
Why would I shoot you in the legs?

07:21.495 --> 07:22.961
Well I just don't want to suffer.

07:23.163 --> 07:24.363
That's kind of the whole point.

07:24.398 --> 07:26.164
We could do two
in the back of the head:

07:26.366 --> 07:27.606
That's painless, instantaneous.

07:27.668 --> 07:29.701
Have you...
killed people before?

07:29.903 --> 07:32.170
Uh, yeah.
Literally scores of them.

07:32.372 --> 07:35.507
I actually used to be the
world's greatest secret agent?

07:35.709 --> 07:38.543

08:00.133 --> 08:02.901

09:04.952 --> 09:09.722
Calm down, Cyril. It's just a, um,
corporate security evaluation.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.525
Unless you want me
to turn down... ten grand.

09:12.727 --> 09:16.862
Well no, obviously I don't--
wait, why did you hesitate there, on "ten"?

09:17.065 --> 09:20.866
It's a lotta money, Cyril, which I
have to go earn for the agency now!

09:21.069 --> 09:22.702
Wh-- Hey, don't forget
to get a--

09:22.904 --> 09:24.737
Recommendation letter.
Got it. Shut up!

09:24.939 --> 09:26.272
[scoffs]
Ten grand my butt.

09:26.474 --> 09:28.034
I bet Archer's
charging them twice that.

09:28.076 --> 09:30.810
Lana, I want you
to tail him tonight, and--

09:31.012 --> 09:33.979
No, I can't. Okay? Tonight I have
to bake a huge batch of hamentashen

09:34.182 --> 09:35.448
and take them over
to that headmaster.

09:35.650 --> 09:37.650
Wait, what, at his house?
Yes.

09:37.852 --> 09:40.319
That sounds like a really bad idea.

09:40.521 --> 09:43.756
So does minding my business.
[slurping]

09:45.259 --> 09:46.759
And apparently her business

09:46.961 --> 09:48.761
is ambiguous,
poorly-worded burns.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.030
Yeah, right?
Okay, so Ray.

09:51.232 --> 09:54.533
I want you to follow Archer
tonight, and-- Oooh, can't.

09:54.736 --> 09:56.802
Why not?
Don't get shitty with me!

09:57.004 --> 09:59.805
Her excuse was hamentashen,
and you didn't even blink!

10:00.007 --> 10:03.442
Since when do you get a free pass
around here just for having a vagina?

10:03.644 --> 10:04.644
Yeah, Cyril!

10:04.712 --> 10:06.345
And also, what is it good for?

10:06.547 --> 10:07.713
What is what good for?

10:07.915 --> 10:10.015
The free pass for havin' a vag.
Duh.

10:10.218 --> 10:11.650
I assume we can expect discounts

10:11.853 --> 10:13.293
at local businesses and theme parks?

10:13.488 --> 10:16.355
Oh for the-- fine,
I'll do it myself!

10:16.557 --> 10:18.991
Well, good luck with no vagina! Ugh.

10:19.193 --> 10:21.227
[gasps]
Not you, Ms. Archer!

10:21.429 --> 10:25.097
Although... Wh-- She's
obviously got a vagina.

10:25.299 --> 10:28.200
Yeah, probably why
she's such a bitch.

10:31.472 --> 10:32.738
[Archer]
Jesus, really?

10:32.940 --> 10:34.907
A glass house?
[sighs]

10:35.109 --> 10:37.276
Probably so people driving by
have to watch him

10:37.478 --> 10:41.247
bang his model wife on a
mattress stuffed with doubloons.

10:41.449 --> 10:45.017
[chuckles] Not tomorrow, buddy.
Then all they're gonna see is,

10:45.219 --> 10:46.619
well, I guess a bunch of cop cars,

10:46.821 --> 10:49.288
and whatever the coroner drives,
probably a van...

10:49.490 --> 10:52.591
Oh and your wife's car,
since she's--

10:52.794 --> 10:54.593
she's the one who's gonna find you.

10:54.796 --> 10:56.596
But, ya know, who's to say
if that's any worse

10:56.798 --> 10:57.930
than being forced to watch you die

10:58.132 --> 10:59.832
a slow and agonizing
death? Right?

11:00.034 --> 11:02.535
Plus I didn't give you cancer.

11:02.737 --> 11:05.237
Plus you're the world's biggest dick.

11:05.439 --> 11:07.583
Except for maybe Whitney.
Oh, and Hitler.

11:09.141 --> 11:11.078
Plus, I didn't give you cancer.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.340
Well, I can't say I blame him.

11:14.649 --> 11:17.750
I'd be getting drunk too,
in his shoes...

11:17.952 --> 11:21.620
I can't imagine what it would be
like to know when you're gonna die.

11:21.823 --> 11:23.255
Or even if.
[snoring]

11:23.457 --> 11:25.925
[sighs] Feel like I
should say a few words.

11:26.127 --> 11:28.093
But none spring to mind.
Okay then.

11:28.904 --> 11:32.264
Archer, you can't
do this... yet.

11:32.466 --> 11:33.766
What if he didn't open the safe?

11:33.968 --> 11:36.101
Where even is the safe?
Dammit...

11:40.408 --> 11:41.408
[man yelling]

11:41.609 --> 11:42.975
What the--
[screams]

11:53.287 --> 11:55.287
[yells] What the shit,
Ivy, what are you--

11:55.489 --> 11:56.956
You think I won't [bleep] kill you?

11:57.158 --> 11:58.390
What the-- Whitney?

11:58.593 --> 11:59.925
Swirling?

12:00.127 --> 12:02.094
[pants]
[clears throat]

12:02.296 --> 12:03.296
[ gun fires ]
[screams]

12:03.464 --> 12:05.231
Oh, God! Ow!

12:06.065 --> 12:09.668
[sobbing, whimpering] Oh, shut up.
It's not that bad.

12:09.871 --> 12:12.638
I have no pinky toe!
You asshole!

12:12.840 --> 12:15.007
Hey! I'm not the
asshole here! Whitney!

12:15.209 --> 12:18.844
I'm the guy with the gun! Not
the asshole, with eight toes!

12:19.046 --> 12:21.113
Nine, you-- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

12:21.315 --> 12:23.115
[groans] So, since you're the
only person on the planet

12:23.317 --> 12:26.118
that I'd like to kill more than
Ivy, and since I haven't yet,

12:26.320 --> 12:28.087
why did he hire me to do that?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.688
I don't know, he's crazy!

12:29.891 --> 12:31.924
And then maybe, in his paranoid mind,

12:32.126 --> 12:34.526
he thinks that for
the past five years maybe

12:34.729 --> 12:38.797
I've been embezzling from the fund and
also maybe sleeping with his wife?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.065
For five years?

12:40.268 --> 12:42.334
We maybe just had our anniversary.

12:42.536 --> 12:44.737
Hey, congratulations...
Oh, thanks, man.

12:44.939 --> 12:46.739
On still being a massive dickhole.

12:46.941 --> 12:48.674
Okay, so I promised Ivy I'd kill you.

12:48.876 --> 12:50.209
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

12:50.411 --> 12:51.651
Look, whatever he's paying you,

12:51.679 --> 12:52.711
I will double it!

12:52.914 --> 12:54.114
Well he's paying
me a hundred--

12:54.215 --> 12:57.316
dammit-- and fifty
thousand dollars, so--

12:57.518 --> 12:58.617
[Cyril] Ahaa!
[both] What?

12:58.819 --> 13:00.686
Ten thousand, my butt!
I knew it!

13:00.888 --> 13:02.688
Are you-- Cyril,
you followed me?

13:02.890 --> 13:04.023
You lied to me!

13:04.225 --> 13:05.824
Yeah, but you didn't know that.

13:06.027 --> 13:08.360
On some level, I think we both did.

13:08.562 --> 13:13.065
Hello, Cyril Figgis, owner and lead
investigator of The Figgis Agency.

13:13.267 --> 13:15.200
How's it going? Trent
Whitney, murder victim.

13:15.403 --> 13:16.735
Would-be murder victim!

13:16.938 --> 13:18.337
I'm sorry,
what-what's happening?

13:18.539 --> 13:20.572
My partner paid him to kill me.

13:20.775 --> 13:23.545
He what? You what? Under
false pretenses, Cyril!

13:23.665 --> 13:25.817
Calm down, I thought
I was killing the other guy.

13:25.937 --> 13:27.564
Why were you killing anybody?

13:27.684 --> 13:29.397
Because I thought he had cancer.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.749
And also in prep school

13:30.952 --> 13:33.052
both of them bullied the
absolute shit out of me.

13:33.254 --> 13:36.522
[laughing]
What? Seriously, dude?

13:36.724 --> 13:40.125
You were going to murder me 'cause
I picked on you a little bit?

13:40.328 --> 13:41.894
A little?
You almost killed me!

13:42.096 --> 13:44.196
I spent freshman year
in the hospital!

13:44.398 --> 13:45.764
With what, AIDS?
[chuckles]

13:45.967 --> 13:49.101
Pneumonia!
From what, complications from AI-- Ow!

13:49.303 --> 13:51.103
Jesus Christ.
And if I'm being honest, yeah,

13:51.305 --> 13:53.572
I'm sure the bullying had some
influence on my decision,

13:53.774 --> 13:57.309
but I was actually murdering
you-- well, Ivy-- for money.

13:57.511 --> 13:58.511
And that makes it better?

13:58.713 --> 14:01.246
Money and cancer,
then! Jesus!

14:01.449 --> 14:04.650
But don't tell me you never fantasized
about killing your bullies, Cyril.

14:04.852 --> 14:08.754
[Archer, crying]
Cyril?

14:08.956 --> 14:11.690
Cyril!

14:11.892 --> 14:14.526
It puts the lotion in the basket!

14:14.729 --> 14:15.894
[Archer] What? What?

14:16.097 --> 14:17.763
What're we doing?
Um, I think Whitney

14:17.965 --> 14:19.631
was about to pay me $300,000?

14:19.834 --> 14:21.800
Not to kill him?
That's extortion!

14:22.003 --> 14:24.903
I know, Cyril, but think of the
alternative. His hands are tied.

14:25.106 --> 14:27.239
And yes, yes, dude, I will pay you,

14:27.441 --> 14:30.743
but the money's not in my house.
It's, it's, it's--

14:30.945 --> 14:33.785
[impersonating Jimmy Stewart] It's in
Tom's house, and-and Bill's house.

14:33.948 --> 14:35.714
And and and and and and and!

14:35.916 --> 14:37.549
Okay, okay, wait, wait!
[keypad pressing]

14:37.752 --> 14:42.054
Dude, check this out. What if I
paid you 500, and you kill Ivy?

14:42.256 --> 14:44.223
Mmm, no, I think just the three.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.992
Ivy's a cuckold, betrayed
by his wife and friend.

14:47.194 --> 14:50.262
You're a cuckolding thief, and
between us, clearly an alcoholic.

14:50.464 --> 14:52.331
He's an alcoholic.
He didn't know

14:52.533 --> 14:55.000
he was gonna die tonight, Cyril.
For him it's just Tuesday.

14:55.202 --> 14:57.870
Anyway, you're both so obviously
and profoundly unhappy

14:58.072 --> 15:00.152
with who you became, that
I bet you're both gonna die

15:00.241 --> 15:01.874
in some bizarre
murder-suicide,

15:02.076 --> 15:03.809
and that is reward enough for me.

15:04.011 --> 15:06.311
Yeah. That and $300,000.

15:06.514 --> 15:10.082
Yeah. [sighs] Well, you
may be right about that.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.384
But I'll tell you this, Swirling.

15:12.586 --> 15:16.655
I shoulda drowned you in piss when
I had the chance, you little fa--

15:16.857 --> 15:18.090
[blood splatters]
[yelps]

15:18.292 --> 15:20.125
Huh.
Jeezy Petes!

15:20.327 --> 15:23.262
Great shot, Archer.
[scoffs] Yeah, right?

15:23.464 --> 15:25.631
But as much as I'd like to
take credit for that...

15:25.833 --> 15:26.865
Ahh!
Yeah, right?

15:27.068 --> 15:29.001
Ahh.
Oof.

15:29.203 --> 15:30.469
Who the heck is shooting at us?

15:30.671 --> 15:31.837
[chuckling]
Cyril, c'mon.

15:32.039 --> 15:33.172
It's obviously Ivy.

15:33.374 --> 15:37.676
C'mon, Swirling, where are you?

15:37.878 --> 15:39.311
I bet this was his plan all along.

15:39.431 --> 15:41.856
He follows me,
I kill Whitney, he kills me,

15:41.976 --> 15:44.002
looks like a robbery.
But I thought he had cancer.

15:44.122 --> 15:46.634
No, dummy, that was just a ruse.

15:46.754 --> 15:48.353
But either way, when I had cancer,

15:48.556 --> 15:50.222
I bet I killed, like, 20 guys,

15:50.424 --> 15:52.825
so it's not a death sentence
anymore, is my point.

15:53.027 --> 15:54.193
No, but this is!

15:54.395 --> 15:55.994
Yeah, he almost made the Olympics.

15:56.197 --> 15:57.863
What?
Biathlon, I know,

15:58.065 --> 16:00.432
you think to yourself
"Pretty gay sport," but--

16:00.634 --> 16:02.634
Holy shit!
What?

16:02.837 --> 16:04.670
You think he knows Ray?

16:11.775 --> 16:14.259
Cyril, stop it!
I mean it, hang up!

16:14.461 --> 16:17.095
Gimme, Cyril. Dammit! Get off.
Stop it! Archer!

16:17.297 --> 16:18.997
<i>[Lana] This is Lana Kane.
Leave a message.</i>

16:19.199 --> 16:20.265
[beep] Lana! Lana, we're--

16:20.467 --> 16:21.667
We're fine.
Everything's great.

16:21.868 --> 16:23.268
Bye, hon.
Oww!

16:23.470 --> 16:24.802
Jeezy Petes!
See?

16:25.005 --> 16:26.204
I told you not to call her.

16:26.406 --> 16:27.872
Well, we can't call the police.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.908
No, uh, this does not look good.

16:30.110 --> 16:31.310
Wonder why she didn't pick up.

16:31.444 --> 16:32.644
[Lana]
I can explain.

16:32.846 --> 16:34.712
What, why you're stalking this guy?

16:34.915 --> 16:37.165
Stalking?
It's just hamentashen!

16:37.384 --> 16:38.883
Okay. You wanna
explain this?

16:39.085 --> 16:41.085
[sigh] You got a license for that?

16:41.288 --> 16:43.221
Well, I'm a private investigator,
so-- [officer laughs]

16:43.423 --> 16:44.989
Got a license for that? [laughs]

16:45.192 --> 16:47.992
Well, not, um, you know,
technically, but-- No.

16:48.195 --> 16:51.429
All you got is baby pictures,
a Sub Club card and...

16:51.631 --> 16:54.933
what appears to be a very
crudely-drawn "vagina pass."

16:55.135 --> 16:56.534
[groans]

16:56.736 --> 16:59.370
Okay, so call Ray, on your cell!

16:59.573 --> 17:00.905
I can't.
Why not?

17:01.107 --> 17:03.885
After the whole biker
voicemail fiasco...

17:04.005 --> 17:05.545
Mother took it away.
What?

17:05.665 --> 17:07.424
What are you, 9 years... Ow!

17:07.544 --> 17:09.396
Haha! Ow!
Haha! Ow!

17:09.516 --> 17:11.516
Shut up! And then you call Ray.

17:11.718 --> 17:13.151
Cyril, why aren't you calling Ray?

17:13.353 --> 17:15.587
Because I don't have a mobile carrier.
Why not?

17:15.789 --> 17:18.690
I've been comparison shopping
for the best rate plan.

17:18.892 --> 17:21.192
For three months? There are
literally two companies!

17:21.394 --> 17:23.228
What the hell can
you possibly be comparing?

17:23.430 --> 17:24.550
Their respective rate plans!

17:24.731 --> 17:26.931
Wow. Okay, so if we
live through this,

17:27.133 --> 17:29.434
which I wouldn't bet
on, I-- Wait, shut up!

17:29.636 --> 17:30.902
[sniffs]
Do you smell that?

17:31.104 --> 17:32.537
Oh, my God, did you shit yourself?

17:32.739 --> 17:34.439
No, that!
[sniffs]

17:34.641 --> 17:36.975
Oh that. Yeah, that's gas. What?

17:37.177 --> 17:39.377
A round must've clipped
the gas line to the stove.

17:39.579 --> 17:41.279
Oh my God.
Yeah, not great.

17:41.481 --> 17:43.481
Even a tiny spark--

17:43.683 --> 17:45.383
And we're dead.

17:45.585 --> 17:47.418
So while you're getting the
money out of the safe-- What?

17:47.621 --> 17:48.786
No, nuh-uh! There's
nothing between

17:48.989 --> 17:50.389
the safe and the bullets! [gun fires]

17:50.423 --> 17:52.257
There's me.
I'm gonna draw his fire.

17:52.459 --> 17:55.260
I'm gonna make a run for the car.
Meanwhile, you clear out the safe!

17:55.462 --> 17:58.363
Okay, but-- Wait, what's to keep
you from just leaving me here?

17:58.565 --> 18:00.098
Wha-- The money,
you idiot!

18:00.300 --> 18:02.734
Oh right, that makes-- What?
One, two, three, go!

18:02.936 --> 18:04.869
[yelling]

18:05.071 --> 18:07.739
Ahh.
[gun firing]

18:07.941 --> 18:10.808
Seriously.
That must be so sticky.

18:11.011 --> 18:13.544
Son of a-- Can't have anything nice.
[car revs]

18:13.747 --> 18:14.879
Cyril, let's go!

18:15.081 --> 18:16.281
Hang on! There's--

18:16.483 --> 18:18.750
Cyril! I swear to God
I will leave you!

18:18.952 --> 18:21.085
[car revs]
Ah. Ooh.

18:21.288 --> 18:24.922
[yelps]
Archer, wait!

18:25.125 --> 18:26.658
[groans]

18:26.860 --> 18:28.459
Oh, good.
You made it.

18:28.662 --> 18:31.596
[tires screeching] In
the-- In the safe he had

18:31.798 --> 18:33.798
all this stuff
from-- from--

18:34.000 --> 18:35.033
[frustrated groan]

18:36.202 --> 18:38.369
Holy shit!
Jeezy Petes!

18:38.571 --> 18:41.506
Dammit! Should've gone
to the owl thing.

18:41.708 --> 18:42.790
[Archer]
What?

18:43.009 --> 18:44.175
[tires screeching]

18:44.377 --> 18:45.443
Longwater!
Just like the--

18:45.645 --> 18:46.925
The Veronica Deane case, I know.

18:47.047 --> 18:48.279
What the hell was in the safe?

18:48.481 --> 18:50.214
Files, disks, all kinds of stuff!

18:50.417 --> 18:52.483
And you just left it?
You left me!

18:52.686 --> 18:54.819
No, I merely tried to!

18:55.021 --> 18:58.222
Hey, Swirling!

18:58.425 --> 18:59.991
Wow, think of how good
you'd have to be

19:00.193 --> 19:01.626
to make the Olympic--
What the?

19:01.828 --> 19:02.828
Cyril, what're you--

19:02.862 --> 19:06.431
Suppressing fire!

19:06.633 --> 19:07.665
[firing blanks]

19:07.867 --> 19:10.001
[chuckles]

19:10.203 --> 19:13.371
So, do you have more bullets, or...
[gun fires]

19:13.573 --> 19:16.040
No.
Oof!

19:16.242 --> 19:19.680
Cyril, I am so mad at you right
now, my mouth tastes like copper.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.983
Well, but are you actually mad at me,

19:22.103 --> 19:23.103
Yes!
or...

19:23.202 --> 19:26.800
- the bullies who tormented a scrawny
teenage boy with no friends? - You!

19:26.920 --> 19:29.087
Because I find it interesting
that you were bullied in school,

19:29.305 --> 19:30.855
and now as an adult you're a bully.

19:31.057 --> 19:32.737
Do you want to talk
about how you bully me?

19:32.926 --> 19:34.192
I do, Cyril.
I really do,

19:34.394 --> 19:35.927
but I'm afraid I'll tear up,

19:36.146 --> 19:38.229
and then not be able to see the road

19:38.431 --> 19:41.132
and then plunge us off the cliff,
and then if you're still alive,

19:41.334 --> 19:44.402
strangle you to death with
my bloody and broken hands!

19:44.604 --> 19:46.604
I also find it interesting that you,

19:46.773 --> 19:49.524
Sterling Archer, man without fear,
are running away from your bully.

19:49.743 --> 19:52.610
Because Cyril Figgis,
man without sense,

19:52.812 --> 19:54.512
wasted all the ammunition!

19:54.714 --> 19:55.947
[tires screeching]
Well, but I

19:56.149 --> 19:57.548
think in a much larger sense

19:57.751 --> 19:59.851
you've been running from
those two your entire life.

20:00.053 --> 20:03.354
And whether it's your personal
relationships, or-- [yelps] Archer?

20:03.556 --> 20:06.340
Take the wheel, dummy!
And you!

20:06.543 --> 20:07.625
Me what?

20:07.794 --> 20:09.127
[roars]

20:09.295 --> 20:11.129
How you like that, Ivy?
[groaning]

20:11.297 --> 20:14.515
Fighting somebody bigger and
stronger than you? Crazy, right?

20:14.718 --> 20:19.804
Imagine what it was like for a
lonely, skinny 13-year-old kid

20:20.006 --> 20:23.307
who'd been to six different
boarding schools since he was five!

20:23.510 --> 20:26.010
Hint! It wasn't great!
[groaning]

20:26.212 --> 20:29.647
[yelps] Yeah, just gonna
give them some space,

20:29.816 --> 20:31.783
do the good old
"three Mississippi."

20:31.985 --> 20:34.819
[both groan] But I hope it
was great for you, Ivy,

20:34.988 --> 20:37.155
because your bullying days are over!

20:37.323 --> 20:40.491
Go ahead, Swirling!
Shoot me!

20:40.710 --> 20:43.661
Oh, huh-uh, you don't get
to take the easy way out, Ivy.

20:43.830 --> 20:46.464
You're going to jail!
Well, you say that.

20:46.666 --> 20:48.433
Whoa!

20:48.635 --> 20:49.801
Archer!

20:50.003 --> 20:51.302
[tires screeching]

20:51.504 --> 20:54.839
[tumbling]

20:56.843 --> 20:59.010
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, Archer!

20:59.212 --> 21:00.645
Yes, what? Shut up.

21:00.847 --> 21:03.014
Oh, my God, how are you still alive?

21:03.216 --> 21:04.916
Jumped out at the last second, Cyril.

21:05.118 --> 21:07.251
The same kind of
split-second decision-making

21:07.454 --> 21:10.321
that caused you to leave
a bunch of clues in the safe!

21:10.523 --> 21:11.923
Idiot!
Ow!

21:12.125 --> 21:14.459
Did you learn nothing from this?

21:14.661 --> 21:16.461
[chuckles]
No.

21:21.948 --> 21:25.807
So listen, I know you've had
your heart set on AJ going to Country Day,

21:26.047 --> 21:27.847
but I've really given it
some serious thought,

21:28.049 --> 21:29.450
and I'm not sure
it's the best thing for her.

21:29.690 --> 21:32.140
I know all kids can be bullies,
but at private school

21:32.359 --> 21:36.511
it seems like there's even more, I
dunno, elitism or snobbery or whatever.

21:36.714 --> 21:40.315
So I really want us to think about A.J.
going to public school.

21:40.534 --> 21:43.285
Because studies have shown
that if a child's intelligent,

21:43.487 --> 21:46.571
and I think A.J. really is, then it
doesn't matter where they go to school.

21:46.790 --> 21:49.958
It's much more important that
learning is fostered in the home

21:50.160 --> 21:52.127
by loving and supportive parents.

21:52.329 --> 21:53.729
[horn blasting]

21:53.931 --> 21:55.297
Plus with the restraining order,

21:55.499 --> 21:57.466
you can't go within
500 feet of the school,

21:57.668 --> 22:00.335
which means I'd be stuck doing
drop-offs and pick-ups every day.

22:00.537 --> 22:03.305
Which, ya know, not doing that.

22:03.507 --> 22:06.341
Anyway, so keep your
chin up, or down I guess.

22:06.543 --> 22:08.143
Shapiro's at your
bail hearing right now,

22:08.278 --> 22:09.778
so you'll be out of here before...

22:09.980 --> 22:11.947
Um, dammit. Um...

22:12.149 --> 22:13.982
You trying to think
of a lesbian joke?

22:14.184 --> 22:17.352
No, hair joke.
Something about braids?

22:17.554 --> 22:21.189
Ah, no, it's gone. Okay stay hard!
What?

22:21.392 --> 22:25.437
Archer! Can you at least put some
money on my canteen account?

22:25.728 --> 22:27.301
No!
