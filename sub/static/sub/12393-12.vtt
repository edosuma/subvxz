10:39.100 --> 10:40.362
IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT,

10:40.400 --> 10:41.867
WINDOWS DOWN.

10:41.900 --> 10:42.901
- SO?

10:42.940 --> 10:44.828
- SO IT WAS 42 DEGREES
THAT NIGHT.

10:44.870 --> 10:47.304
- MORE IMPORTANTLY, CARS DON'T
SUDDENLY BLOW UP ON THEIR OWN.

10:47.340 --> 10:48.739
THEY CERTAINLY DON'T BLOW UP
IN A WAY

10:48.780 --> 10:50.338
SO THERE'S NO TRACE
OF ANYTHING.

10:50.380 --> 10:51.506
- SO WHAT'S NEXT?

10:51.550 --> 10:53.541
- SO GLAD YOU ASKED,

10:53.580 --> 10:56.981
BECAUSE THE THING IS...AHEM.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.487
[whispering] I MANAGED TO GET
ONTO A WEBSITE

10:58.520 --> 11:00.078
THAT I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T BE ON.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.315
- SHAWN, DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
GOING ALL PETE TOWNSEND ON ME.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.851
- I FINALLY BUSTED OUT MY
TREASURY DEPARTMENT PASSWORD.

11:04.890 --> 11:06.050
- WHAT?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.156
- YOU DON'T HAVE
A TREASURY DEPARTMENT PASSWORD.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.963
- NO, BUT AGENT LARS EWING DID,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.934
AND HE WAS REALLY LOUSY
AT USING HIS OTHER HAND

11:12.970 --> 11:14.096
TO COVER HIS TYPING HAND.

11:17.740 --> 11:18.832
- WHY ARE WE USING
MY COMPUTER?

11:18.870 --> 11:20.508
- 'CAUSE IT'S NICE.

11:20.540 --> 11:22.178
[beep]

11:33.290 --> 11:35.884
- WE JUST GOT A HIT
ON THE NAME SCO'I'I' SEAVER.

11:38.660 --> 11:39.888
- IS IT LOCAL?

11:39.930 --> 11:41.852
- FAIRLY.
SANTA BARBARA.

11:49.270 --> 11:51.261
- ARE YOU SURE IT'S COOL FOR US
TO BE IN THE CHIEF'S OFFICE?

11:51.310 --> 11:53.733
- OF COURSE, IT IS.
I PRACTICALLY RUN THIS PLACE.

11:53.780 --> 11:54.974
- ALL RIGHT.

11:55.010 --> 11:57.001
- HIT THE DECK!

11:58.550 --> 12:00.518
[whispering]
IT'S THE BISCUIT LADY.

12:00.550 --> 12:01.778
WE'RE GOOD.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.913
I OWE HER 80 CENTS.

12:07.190 --> 12:09.158
AND I...I KIND OF MADE OUT
WITH HER

12:09.190 --> 12:11.124
AT THE DEPARTMENT PICNIC.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.582
OKAY, SO HERE
ARE MY FINDINGS.

12:12.630 --> 12:15.019
TURNS OUT JULIET'S BOYFRIEND
WAS WORKING FOR A COMPANY

12:15.060 --> 12:17.164
OWNED BY THE
INFAMOUS J.T. WARING.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.292
- WHO?
- COME ON, GUS.

12:18.330 --> 12:19.422
SHE WROTE ALL THE
HARRY PO'I'I'ERS.

12:19.470 --> 12:20.937
- THAT'S J.K. ROWLING, SHAWN.

12:20.970 --> 12:23.768
- J.T. WARING
IS A LOS ANGELES MOBSTER.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.334
WENT DOWN FOR RACKETEERING
A FEW YEARS AGO.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.439
- WHAT'S RACKETEERING?

12:26.470 --> 12:28.506
- NOBODY KNOWS.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.609
GET DOWN!

12:32.750 --> 12:34.308
- THAT WAS A DUDE.

12:34.350 --> 12:36.375
- THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
SOME CRAZY PICNIC.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.888
- SO THIS BUILDING
WAS WARING'S LEGITIMATE FRONT.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.582
I THINK THIS SEAVER GUY
GOT IN OVER HIS HEAD

12:41.620 --> 12:44.851
AND SOMEONE TOOK HIM DOWN...
HARD.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.025
ONE OF US IS
GONNA HAVE TO GRILL JULIET

12:49.060 --> 12:50.664
ON HER DEAD BOYFRIEND.

12:50.700 --> 12:51.894
I NOMINATE YOU.

12:51.930 --> 12:53.795
- WAIT A SECOND. WE'RE GONNA
INTERROGATE HER NOW?

12:53.840 --> 12:55.796
HASN'T SHE BEEN
THROUGH ENOUGH ALREADY?

12:55.840 --> 12:57.660
- WE'LL ALL DO IT TOGETHER...

12:57.710 --> 12:59.564
VERY DELICATELY.

13:06.210 --> 13:07.541
- WHAT?

13:07.580 --> 13:12.608
- JULES, WE WERE THINKING, UM,
COLLECT IVELY,

13:12.650 --> 13:14.584
THAT IT MIGHT BE NICE
IF YOU TOLD US

13:14.620 --> 13:15.814
A LITTLE MORE ABOUT SCOTT.

13:15.860 --> 13:19.284
- YEAH, ESPECIALLY
HIS DARKEST TENDENCIES,

13:19.330 --> 13:20.820
PRIORS, FETISHES.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.748
- [choking]

13:26.630 --> 13:28.097
- GUS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.301
- [crying]
I'M A SYMPATHETIC CRIER.

13:30.340 --> 13:33.434
- I AM NOT CRYING.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.698
CAN'T YOU GUYS JUST GIVE ME
A LITTLE TIME

13:35.740 --> 13:37.549
TO GET MY THOUGHTS TOGETHER?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.174
- THAT WAS YOUR FAULT.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.289
- FETISHES?

13:43.320 --> 13:45.185
- TELL EYE FAUCETS HERE.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.188
- [crying]

13:47.220 --> 13:48.414
- FOR GOD SAKES, MAN.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.449
- NO, I'M FINE.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.521
- JULES, UH--

13:53.560 --> 13:54.993
I'M SO SORRY.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.328
I DON'T USUALLY DO
HORRIBLE THINGS TO PEOPLE

13:57.370 --> 13:58.428
THAT I CARE ABOUT.
I DON'T.

13:58.470 --> 13:59.960
- OH, SHAWN, IT'S OKAY.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.230
IT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY NICE
OF YOU TO ASK ABOUT HIM.

14:02.270 --> 14:05.364
HE WAS A WONDERFUL,
WONDERFUL GUY.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.275
- YEAH, HE SOUNDS LIKE IT.

14:07.310 --> 14:10.143
- I WAS CRAZY ABOUT HIM.

14:10.180 --> 14:12.603
ALL OF MY GIRLFRIENDS SAID
IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS SO TALL.

14:12.650 --> 14:15.073
I LOVE TALL GUYS.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.917
BUT FOR ME, IT WAS...

14:16.950 --> 14:19.282
IT WAS HIS HEART
AND HIS SOUL,

14:19.320 --> 14:21.413
HIS ATH LETICISM.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.257
- LET ME GUESS--
HE PLAYED FOOTBALL.

14:23.290 --> 14:24.689
- TIGHT END.

14:24.730 --> 14:28.791
- YOU KNOW, JULES, SOMETIMES WE
TEND TO ROMANTICIZE THE PAST.

14:28.830 --> 14:30.024
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT.

14:30.070 --> 14:33.130
- NO. NO, NOT WITH SCOTT.

14:33.170 --> 14:38.369
HE WAS JUST SO SECURE
AND GENUINE...

14:38.410 --> 14:40.139
OPTIMISTIC AND YOUTHFUL.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.149
HE HAD
THIS RARE FIGURINE COLLECTION.

14:43.180 --> 14:45.148
DUMBO. I LOVED DUMBO
WHEN I WAS A KID,

14:45.180 --> 14:47.569
AND HE GAVE ME ONE
WHEN I TURNED 18,

14:47.620 --> 14:50.748
BROKE UP A SET. IT WAS
HUGELY VALUABLE AS A SET,

14:50.790 --> 14:52.212
AND HE GAVE IT TO ME,

14:52.250 --> 14:53.911
'CAUSE IT MEANT SOMETHING TO ME
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.417
- YOU LIKE TALL MEN
AND FAT ANIMALS.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.519
- YES. YES, I DO.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.098
HE HAD THIS CONNECTION THROUGH
HIS LATE GRANDFATHER'S OFFICE

15:02.130 --> 15:03.290
WITH THE MAYOR,

15:03.330 --> 15:06.424
AND HE ACTUALLY GOT US
SUPER BOWL TICKETS.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.539
35 YARD LINE.

15:07.570 --> 15:09.037
- SUPER. . .BOWL?

15:09.070 --> 15:12.233
- IT WAS THE MOST
EXCITING NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

15:12.270 --> 15:14.830
- GET OUT OF HERE!

15:14.880 --> 15:18.907
YOU AND YOUR BLACK FRIEND,
GET OUT OF HERE!

15:18.950 --> 15:23.080
- WOW. SHAWN,
I ACTUALLY FEEL BETTER.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.087
THANK YOU.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.519
- THAT MAKES ME SO HAPPY.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.381
- [laughs]

15:30.930 --> 15:34.718
- OH! COME HERE,
'CAUSE WE TALKED IT OUT.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.819
- OKAY, YEAH.
- GOD, IT FEELS SO HAPPY.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.197
SHOULD WE KEEP WALKING?

15:40.240 --> 15:41.935
- SURE.
- OKAY.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.703
- LOOK, SHAWN, THE COUNTY
SHERIFF WAS NO HELP AT ALL,

15:47.740 --> 15:49.731
AND THE ACCIDENT SCENE
WHERE SCOTT CRASHED HIS CAR?

15:49.780 --> 15:51.304
IT'S NOW A MINI-MALL.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.875
HOW NOBODY COULD HAVE TAKEN
ONE SINGLE PHOTOGRAPH,

15:53.920 --> 15:55.148
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

15:55.180 --> 15:56.772
THESE GUYS ARE
A BUNCH OF JACKASSES.

15:56.820 --> 15:58.287
- WELL, DAD,
THANKS FOR TRYING,

15:58.320 --> 16:00.311
AND BONUS POINTS FOR USING
THE WORD "JACKASS"

16:00.360 --> 16:02.510
IN ANOTHER CONVERSATION
UNIRONICALLY.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.027
- YOU'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE
THIS WHOLE TIME?

16:04.060 --> 16:05.482
SO YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
ANYTHING I SAID.

16:05.530 --> 16:07.327
- THE COMPLAINING?
NO, I HEARD THE COMPLAINING.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.896
- WE'VE BEEN GOING
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION

16:08.930 --> 16:10.295
FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS NOW, SHAWN.

16:10.330 --> 16:13.868
WHAT? I KNOW THAT LOOK.
WHAT ARE YOU ON TO?

16:13.900 --> 16:16.539
- DUMBO FIGURINES.

16:16.570 --> 16:21.507
SO, TURNS OUT, THOSE FIGURINES
ARE EXTREMELY RARE,

16:21.540 --> 16:23.201
MAYBE THREE COMPLETE SETS
IN THE WORLD.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.205
- OKAY.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.342
- DID A LITTLE SEARCH ON eBAY.

16:25.380 --> 16:27.041
SOMEONE IS SELLING
THE EXACT SET,

16:27.080 --> 16:29.514
MINUS THE PIECE
THAT SCOTT GAVE TO JULES.

16:29.550 --> 16:31.211
- SO THIS IS THE APARTMENT
OF THE PERSON WHO BOUGHT THEM?

16:31.250 --> 16:32.342
I'LL CALL LASSIE.

16:32.390 --> 16:33.687
- NO, GUS,
THAT'LL TAKE TOO LONG.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.859
BESIDES, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHOSE JURISDICTION WE'RE IN.

16:35.890 --> 16:37.323
HERE'S THE THING.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.852
I THINK SCOTT WAS MURDERED,
ROBBED.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.856
THE KILLER THINKS
THE COAST IS CLEAR.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.788
HE'S FINALLY SELLING OFF
HIS BELONGINGS.

16:44.830 --> 16:46.092
[knocking]

16:46.130 --> 16:47.438
- SO ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS FIND THE SELLER.

16:47.470 --> 16:48.664
- WE JUST DID!

16:48.700 --> 16:49.735
- WHAT?

16:49.770 --> 16:51.260
- OOH.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.005
YOU JUST KNOCKED ON THE DOOR
OF A MURDERER,

16:53.040 --> 16:54.371
AND ALL YOU CAN SAY
IS "OOH"?

16:54.410 --> 16:55.638
- I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT IN MY HEAD

16:55.680 --> 16:56.738
BEFORE I SAID IT OUT LOUD,

16:56.780 --> 16:58.077
BUT I WANTED A FUN REVEAL
FOR YOU.

16:58.110 --> 16:59.907
- SHAWN!

16:59.950 --> 17:01.315
both: AAH!

17:03.220 --> 17:05.814
- HEY, JULES, GOT SOME
GOOD NEWS AND SOME BAD NEWS.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.215
- STOP.
- WHAT?

17:07.260 --> 17:09.478
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
THAT SCOTT SEAVER GUY WAS DEAD?

17:09.520 --> 17:11.056
- OH, SHAWN, NOT NOW.

17:11.090 --> 17:13.729
- WELL, HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.733
- OH, MY GOD.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.032
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

17:26.070 --> 17:29.437
[laughter]

17:29.480 --> 17:33.075
- OKAY, THAT'S--
THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH OF THAT.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.339
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M...
I'M SEEING YOU.

17:36.380 --> 17:39.417
- THERE'S SO MUCH
I WANT TO TELL YOU.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.418
- SHAWN?

17:41.460 --> 17:43.655
WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?

17:43.690 --> 17:45.157
- THERE IS NO BAD NEWS.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.624
- ACTUALLY, THERE IS.

17:47.660 --> 17:50.220
- THIS IS DANIEL WAYNE.
HE'S A FEDERAL MARSHAL.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.022
THESE ARE THE TWO
WHO FOUND MR. SEAVER.

17:52.070 --> 17:53.799
- [laughs] YOU DID THIS?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.569
- YES, WE DID,
BUT DON'T WORRY.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.999
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR A REWARD.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.359
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD,

17:58.410 --> 18:00.298
BECAUSE WE GENERALLY
DON'T GIVE OUT REWARDS

18:00.340 --> 18:01.534
FOR EXPOSING A KEY WITNESS

18:01.580 --> 18:03.138
RIGHT OUT OF
WITNESS PROTECTION.

18:14.290 --> 18:16.019
- AND AFTER COLLEGE,
I LANDED A JOB

18:16.060 --> 18:18.824
AS AN IMPORTS APPRAISER
FOR A COMPANY IN LOS ANGELES,

18:18.860 --> 18:20.794
BUT IT WASN'T TILL LATER
I FOUND OUT THAT, UH,

18:20.830 --> 18:23.867
ONE OF THE COMPANY'S SILENT
PARTNERS WAS J.T. WARING.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.993
- WHO WAS A WELL-KNOWN FIGURE

18:26.030 --> 18:27.668
IN ORGANIZED CRIME CIRCLES
DOWN THERE.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.065
- YOU WERE WORKING
FOR A CRIMINAL?

18:29.100 --> 18:30.067
- I DIDN'T KNOW.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.499
- WARING WAS USING IT
AS A FRONT

18:31.540 --> 18:33.576
FOR A NUMBER
OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

18:33.610 --> 18:35.134
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE
OF HIS EMPLOYEES,

18:35.180 --> 18:38.001
SO WE RAIDED HIS BUSINESS,
AND WE TOOK HIM INTO CUSTODY.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.699
- AND THAT'S WHEN I FOUND OUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.275
- WARING KILLED A FEDERAL AGENT
DURING THE RAID.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.117
IT WAS MR. SEAVER'S TESTIMONY

18:44.150 --> 18:45.845
THAT PLACED HIM IN THE ROOM
WITH THE DEAD AGENT,

18:45.890 --> 18:48.484
EFFECT IVELY SECURING
HIS LIFE SENTENCE.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.010
MR. SEAVER HERE'S A HERO.

18:50.060 --> 18:51.459
- WOW.

18:51.490 --> 18:53.890
- I'M SURE ANY OF US WOULD HAVE
DONE THE SAME IN HIS PLACE.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.989
- NO, WE WOULDN'T. REMEMBER
WHEN YOU SAW THAT ACCIDENT

18:56.030 --> 18:57.327
AND THEN YOU PRETENDED
TO BE BLIND?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.519
- THAT'S DIFFERENT.

18:58.570 --> 18:59.889
OUR MOVIE WAS GONNA START
IN EIGHT MINUTES.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.591
WHY WOULD YOU BRING THAT UP?

19:01.640 --> 19:03.301
- YOU WERE WILLING
TO RISK YOUR LIFE

19:03.340 --> 19:05.035
TO PUT A DANGEROUS MAN
BEHIND BARS?

19:05.070 --> 19:08.107
- YEAH. MR. SEAVER
IS A GREAT AMERICAN.

19:08.140 --> 19:09.903
- WHO WORKED FOR A CRIMINAL.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.204
- AND NOW HIS LIFE
MAY BE IN GRAVE DANGER.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.241
MR. WARING
IS VERY WELL-CONNECT ED,

19:14.280 --> 19:15.372
EVEN BEHIND BARS.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.012
THESE PEOPLE HOLD GRUDGES,

19:17.050 --> 19:18.586
AND THEY PAY FOR THEM
IN BLOOD.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.713
WELL, FORTUNATELY,
I HAVE MY TEAM

19:20.760 --> 19:23.012
PREPARING A NEW IDENTITY
FOR MR. SEAVER.

19:23.060 --> 19:24.084
- I'M NOT GOING.

19:26.260 --> 19:28.148
MY LIFE IS HERE.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.760
NOT ONLY DID YOU SHOW UP
AT THE TRAIN STATION,

19:30.800 --> 19:32.529
BUT WHEN I WASN'T THERE,
YOU...

19:32.570 --> 19:35.960
YOU SEARCHED
HIGH AND LOW FOR ME.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.605
I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT
YOU PEOPLE HAVE DONE FOR ME,

19:38.640 --> 19:40.699
BUT YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND,
WITNESS PROTECTION,

19:40.740 --> 19:42.037
IT MIGHT AS WELL BE PRISON.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.401
I NEVER FELT COMFORTABLE,
AND I NEVER FELT SAFE.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.145
- I VOTE HE GOES BACK.

19:46.180 --> 19:48.671
- YOU WILL NEVER BE SAFE
OUT OF PROTECTION.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.348
ONCE THEY MAKE YOU,
YOU'RE GONE.

19:51.390 --> 19:55.019
- LOOK, WARING IS SERVING
THREE LIFE SENTENCES.

19:55.060 --> 19:57.528
I'M NOT THE BIGGEST PIECE
OF THE PUZZLE HERE.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.996
THE BOTTOM LINE IS
I'M OUT, I'M SAFE,

20:01.030 --> 20:02.292
AND I DON'T CARE.

20:02.330 --> 20:04.093
- SCOTT.

20:04.130 --> 20:05.666
SCOTT!

20:07.000 --> 20:07.989
SCOTT!

20:08.040 --> 20:09.837
HEY!

20:09.870 --> 20:12.703
- OH, WHAT, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THIS IS MY FAULT?

20:12.740 --> 20:13.968
WHAT ABOUT GUS?

20:19.180 --> 20:20.272
- I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A CHANCE

20:20.320 --> 20:22.049
TO COOK FOR ANYBODY
IN PROTECTION.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.082
IT'S WEIRD WHEN A DATE ASKS,
"TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF,"

20:24.120 --> 20:26.042
AND YOU HAVE TO ANSWER FROM
A GOVERNMENT-ISSUED NOTE CARD.

20:26.090 --> 20:27.387
- [laughs]

20:27.420 --> 20:29.217
HEY, TELL ME SOMETHING,
WHEN YOU WERE IN THE PROGRAM,

20:29.260 --> 20:30.818
DID YOU EVER ORDER
SPAGHETTI MARINARA

20:30.860 --> 20:32.725
AND GET EGG NOODLES
AND KETCHUP INSTEAD?

20:32.760 --> 20:34.159
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:34.200 --> 20:37.158
- UH, IT'S FROM GOODFELLAS.
NEVER MIND.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.691
- OH, YEAH, I GET IT.
NO, I DON'T.

20:39.730 --> 20:40.799
- [laughs]

20:40.840 --> 20:42.467
- WOW, LOOK AT THIS SPICE RACK.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.104
ALL THE SEALS UNBROKEN.

20:44.140 --> 20:45.698
- YEAH,
I DON'T REALLY GET A CHANCE

20:45.740 --> 20:47.571
TO COOK FOR ANYONE, EITHER.

20:47.610 --> 20:49.202
COP HOURS.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.879
- FINALLY REGRETTING THAT CHOICE
NOT TO ATTEND CLOWN COLLEGE?

20:51.910 --> 20:54.242
- [laughing]

20:55.850 --> 20:56.817
- SO...

20:56.850 --> 20:58.147
- SO...

20:58.190 --> 21:00.146
- HOW DO WE DO THIS?

21:00.190 --> 21:04.923
- I GUESS WE START
FROM SEVEN YEARS AGO

21:04.960 --> 21:06.154
AND MOVE ON FROM THERE,

21:06.190 --> 21:08.055
AND LEAVE OUT
ALL THE BORING PARTS.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.829
- WHAT IF THERE ARE
NO BORING PARTS?

21:09.860 --> 21:12.920
- THEN THIS IS GOING TO BE
A VERY LONG CONVERSATION.

21:12.970 --> 21:14.835
[muffled thumps
and dog barking]

21:18.110 --> 21:19.839
- WHOA! WHAT IS THAT?
- I AM SO SORRY, SCOTT,

21:19.870 --> 21:23.169
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE WINDOW.

21:27.550 --> 21:29.518
- IT WAS A MALE ABOUT 5'8".
I CHASED HIM OFF.

21:29.550 --> 21:31.415
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE SLIPPED
PAST ME, UNLESS HE'S A PRO.

21:31.450 --> 21:33.281
YOU STAY PUT.
I GOT BACK-UP ON THE WAY.

21:33.320 --> 21:37.108
- WAIT. THIS ISN'T A DATE?
YOU'RE PROTECTING ME?

21:41.600 --> 21:45.092
- LOOK, WE NEED TO GET HIM
BACK INTO PROTECTION, OKAY?

21:45.130 --> 21:47.223
I GOT A GUY WHO CAN DISAPPEAR
WITH HIM RIGHT NOW.

21:47.270 --> 21:49.295
WARING'S MEN ARE OUT THERE,
YOU KNOW?

21:49.340 --> 21:51.331
LOOK, AGENT WAYNE,
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS ANYONE

21:51.370 --> 21:53.235
THAT MR. SEAVER
IS A PRIVATE CITIZEN,

21:53.270 --> 21:55.830
AND HE ISN'T LEGALLY COMPELLED
TO DO ANY SUCH THING.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.371
- WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING
WE CAN TO ENSURE HIS SAFETY.

21:58.410 --> 22:01.049
- OH, YEAH, POSTING ONE COP
OUTSIDE HER EXPOSED APARTMENT

22:01.080 --> 22:02.741
WHILE SHE PLAYS
GRAB-ASS INSIDE?

22:02.780 --> 22:04.543
- WHOA!

22:04.590 --> 22:06.478
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHO WAS IN YOUR APARTMENT?

22:06.520 --> 22:08.010
- THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,

22:08.060 --> 22:09.880
WE MAY HAVE OVERREACT ED
LAST NIGHT.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.922
WE NEVER ACTUALLY SAW
THE ASSAILANT,

22:11.960 --> 22:13.689
OR THE ALLEGED ASSAILANT.

22:13.730 --> 22:16.153
- WHAT TIME ARE WE TALKING HERE,
BEFORE CONAN OR AFTER CONAN?

22:16.200 --> 22:17.622
- A PERSON WAS SEEN,
WE CHASED HIM OFF.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.763
WE CAN'T BE SURE THAT
HE WAS COMING AFTER SCOTT.

22:19.800 --> 22:23.406
- LISTEN, GIRL,
I DON'T CARE.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.737
- TOMMY LEE JONES!

22:24.770 --> 22:25.759
- WHAT?

22:25.810 --> 22:26.902
- FUGITIVE.

22:26.940 --> 22:28.305
YOU'RE MISSING
SOME OF THE COUNTRY--

22:28.340 --> 22:29.534
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHAKE IT OFF.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.070
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.
I'LL BE HARRISON.

22:31.110 --> 22:33.874
- YOU KNOW, I USED TO HAVE
SOME RESPECT,

22:33.920 --> 22:35.717
AND YOU HAVE SINGLE-HANDEDLY

22:35.750 --> 22:37.388
LET THIS GUY
DESTROY MY CAREER.

22:37.420 --> 22:39.809
- I GET IT, AGENT WAYNE.
YOU'RE VERY IMPORTANT,

22:39.850 --> 22:41.784
BUT WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
HANDLE MY PEOPLE

22:41.820 --> 22:42.957
WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS BUILDING?

22:42.990 --> 22:44.582
- ALL RIGHT,
EVERYBODY RELAX.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.757
I ADMIT THAT SOME OF THIS
IS MY FAULT.

22:46.790 --> 22:48.052
- [scoffs]

22:48.100 --> 22:49.727
- MUCH OF IT IS MY FAULT.
- ALMOST ALL.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.069
- BUT WE RECOGNIZE THE TROUBLE
THAT WE HAVE CAUSED.

22:52.100 --> 22:55.536
I HAVE A PLAN,
AND I WILL FIX IT.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.448
- THIS IS YOUR FIX, SHAWN? THE
MAN IS A CONVICTED MURDERER.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.640
HE'S GONNA HAVE US KILLED.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.978
- GUS, DON'T BE THE "IT"
IN "WAIT FOR IT!"

23:07.010 --> 23:08.819
THIS IS GONNA WORK GREAT.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.413
HELLO, MR. WARING.

23:15.460 --> 23:18.384
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER,
WELL-KNOWN PSYCHIC DETECTIVE,

23:18.430 --> 23:20.955
AND THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE,
BURTON GUSTER.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.820
- [whispering] NOW YOU
WANNA USE MY REAL NAME?

23:22.860 --> 23:24.521
- WE'D LIKE
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION

23:24.570 --> 23:26.060
ABOUT ONE SCOTT SEAVER.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.397
- YOU MEAN NOW THAT HE'S

23:27.440 --> 23:28.839
OUT OF WITNESS PROTECTION?

23:28.870 --> 23:29.837
- YOU KNEW THAT?

23:29.870 --> 23:31.701
- YOU JUST CONFIRMED IT
FOR ME.

23:31.740 --> 23:32.900
[click]

23:32.940 --> 23:34.976
- I CAN'T CATCH A BREAK
THIS WEEK, CAN I?

23:35.010 --> 23:36.409
- WHAT DO YOU WANT,
MR. SPENCER?

23:36.440 --> 23:38.544
- WE WERE HOPING WE COULD COME
HERE AND APPEAL TO YOU

23:38.580 --> 23:40.104
SO THAT NOTHING
HAPPENS TO HIM.

23:40.150 --> 23:42.710
- SCOTT SEAVER
IS THE REASON I'M IN HERE.

23:44.350 --> 23:46.147
- [British accent]
LOOK, SCOTT SEAVER

23:46.190 --> 23:47.555
WORKED FOR YOU
FOR TWO YEARS.

23:47.590 --> 23:48.989
HE HAD NO BEEF WITH YOU.

23:49.020 --> 23:50.385
- WHY ARE YOU TALKING
IN AN ACCENT?

23:50.420 --> 23:52.251
- I'M SPEAKING
THIS MAN'S LANGUAGE.

23:52.290 --> 23:53.826
- THE MAN'S LANGUAGE
IS ENGLISH, SHAWN.

23:53.860 --> 23:55.327
- WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

23:55.360 --> 23:57.794
- I HAVE A POINT.
IT'S THIS:

23:57.830 --> 24:00.799
SCOTT SEAVER'S A DECENT GUY,
TRYING TO LIVE HIS LIFE

24:00.840 --> 24:02.432
IN A DECENT WAY,
AND I AM SENSING

24:02.470 --> 24:04.461
THAT YOU ARE
ALSO A DECENT MAN.

24:04.510 --> 24:07.138
PERHAPS IT WILL EASE YOUR
CONSCIENCE A BIT TO LET HIM BE.

24:07.170 --> 24:09.536
- YOU SENSE I'M A DECENT MAN?

24:09.580 --> 24:11.468
- YES. PLUS, YOU'RE SERVING

24:11.510 --> 24:12.738
TH REE CONSECUTIVE
LIFE SENTENCES,

24:12.780 --> 24:14.645
SO SCOTT'S TESTIMONY
THAT PUT YOU IN THE ROOM

24:14.680 --> 24:16.648
WITH THE DEAD MARSHAL'S BODY
DOESN'T REALLY MEAN MUCH.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.216
I MEAN, NOT
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS.

24:18.250 --> 24:21.310
- LOOK, MR. SPENCER.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.955
SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN
WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE.

24:24.990 --> 24:27.185
PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE
WANT TO DO THINGS FOR ME

24:27.230 --> 24:29.425
WHETHER I ASK THEM TO
OR NOT.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.792
I HAVE THAT KIND OF EFFECT
ON PEOPLE.

24:31.830 --> 24:33.491
- COURSE, THEY DO.
YOU'RE SUPER COOL.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.337
- SHAWN!
- WHAT?

24:35.370 --> 24:36.837
MY QUESTION IS THIS--

24:36.870 --> 24:40.260
COULD YOU ASK THOSE PEOPLE TO
NOT DO THOSE THINGS TO SCOTT?

24:42.210 --> 24:44.701
- PERHAPS.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

24:44.750 --> 24:46.638
- HOW ABOUT I BAKE YOU A CAKE

24:46.680 --> 24:49.569
THAT'S EXTRA HIGH
IN...IRON?

24:49.620 --> 24:53.340
- I HAVE A FAR LESS RIDICULOUS
COUNTER-PROPOSAL FOR YOU.

24:53.390 --> 24:55.153
IF YOU ARE A PSYCHIC,

24:55.190 --> 24:57.055
HOW ABOUT YOU PROVE SOMETHING
FOR ME?

24:57.090 --> 24:58.387
- WHAT'S THAT?

24:58.430 --> 24:59.454
- HEY.
- STOP IT.

24:59.490 --> 25:01.253
- THAT I DIDN'T KILL THAT MAN.

25:02.830 --> 25:03.990
- SERIOUSLY, SHAWN,

25:04.030 --> 25:05.588
OF COURSE HE'S GONNA SAY
HE'S NOT GUILTY.

25:05.630 --> 25:06.858
ALL CONS ARE INNOCENT.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.868
- LET'S JUST HEAR HIM OUT.

25:08.900 --> 25:11.039
- THE DEAD MARSHAL AT THE RAID,
AGENT RENFRO--

25:11.070 --> 25:12.799
HE WAS DEAD
WHEN I FOUND HIM.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.377
I WAS AT THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME,

25:15.410 --> 25:17.105
AND THE MURDER
GOT PINNED ON ME.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.074
- MY GOD, HE'S CONVINCING.

25:19.110 --> 25:21.044
- CONVINCING?
HE'S A CRIMINAL.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.968
- YES, BUT HE HAS
A GREAT HEAD,

25:23.020 --> 25:24.681
AND A REAL PRESENCE.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.517
THERE'S SOMETHING
VERY BILLY ZANE-IAN ABOUT HIM.

25:26.550 --> 25:27.619
- YOU AND BILLY ZANE

25:27.660 --> 25:29.059
ARE THE ONLY ONES
WHO USE THAT TERM.

25:29.090 --> 25:30.512
THE MAN
IS PLAYING YOU, SHAWN.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.654
HE'S A MURDERER, A LIAR,
AND THE LOWEST FORM OF TRASH.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.793
- YOU KNOW THESE THINGS
DON'T TURN OFF, RIGHT?

25:35.830 --> 25:39.391
[clicking]

25:39.430 --> 25:40.658
- HELLO?

25:40.700 --> 25:42.236
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND
ABOUT HONOR, MR. SPENCER?

25:42.270 --> 25:43.635
- OF COURSE I DO.

25:43.670 --> 25:46.161
I HAVE A BOOTLEG COPY OF
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN AT HOME.

25:46.210 --> 25:48.678
- IT'S THE FIRST AND LAST THING
MY FATHER TAUGHT ME.

25:48.710 --> 25:51.008
WITHOUT HONOR,
THERE IS NOTHING.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.870
NOW, I DON'T MIND
SERVING THE TIME

25:52.910 --> 25:54.616
FOR A CRIME
I MAY HAVE COMMITTED,

25:54.650 --> 25:56.049
BUT I DON'T KILL PEOPLE,

25:56.080 --> 25:58.446
AND I CAN'T HAVE MY CHILDREN
THINK I DO.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.446
- I BELIEVE YOU.
- YOU DO NOT.

26:00.490 --> 26:01.980
- YES, I DO.
- OH, MY GOSH.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.419
- THEN VINDICATE ME,

26:03.460 --> 26:05.587
AND MR. SEAVER WILL BE SAFE,

26:05.630 --> 26:07.598
BUT NOT UNTIL MY NAME
IS CLEARED.

26:07.630 --> 26:09.928
DEAL?

26:09.960 --> 26:11.621
- [whispering] DON'T DO IT.
DON'T DO IT, SHAWN.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.558
DON'T DO IT.
NO, NO.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.999
DON'T, DON'T, DON'T.

26:16.500 --> 26:17.489
- DEAL.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.869
- I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

26:29.920 --> 26:31.387
THAT YOU HAVE MY BLESSING.

26:32.220 --> 26:33.244
- FOR WHAT?

26:33.290 --> 26:35.485
- TO CONSUMMATE
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SCOTT.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.078
- WHOA, CARLTON.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.759
- I JUST MEANT THAT...

26:39.790 --> 26:42.691
SHOULD THIS THING WORK OUT...

26:42.730 --> 26:44.322
THIS GUY'S OKAY
IN MY BOOK.

26:45.970 --> 26:49.235
LOOK, I DON'T GET TO BE
A CONFIDANTE ALL THAT OFTEN...

26:49.270 --> 26:52.068
EVER, FOR ANYBODY, 'CAUSE
PEOPLE DON'T REALLY TALK TO ME,

26:52.110 --> 26:54.499
SO I WANTED TO GIVE THIS
CAREFUL CONSIDERATION,

26:54.540 --> 26:56.872
AND, AFTER A THOROUGH
BACKGROUND CHECK

26:56.910 --> 27:00.243
AND AN UNAUTHORIZED BLOOD TEST,

27:00.280 --> 27:02.168
I GET WHAT YOU SEE
IN THIS GUY.

27:02.220 --> 27:03.517
- HMM...

27:03.550 --> 27:05.814
- WHAT?
YOU DON'T SEEM SO SURE.

27:05.850 --> 27:09.081
- I SHOWED UP
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE,

27:09.120 --> 27:11.156
AND NOW HE THINKS
I COMBED THE STATE FOR HIM.

27:11.190 --> 27:14.455
I MEAN, I WOULD THINK
I WAS A LITTLE CREEPY.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.491
[laughs]
IT'S JUST A LOT TO TAKE.

27:16.530 --> 27:18.521
YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL LIKE?

27:18.570 --> 27:20.424
I FEEL LIKE THAT SCENE
IN GREASE.

27:20.470 --> 27:23.735
- AFTER THE BONFIRE,
WHEN SANDY'S SPRUNG ON DANNY

27:23.770 --> 27:26.409
WHEN HE LEAST EXPECT S IT.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.908
WHAT?
I CAN'T SEE MOVIES TOO?

27:28.940 --> 27:32.148
- THAT IS SPOT ON,
WITH SCARY PRECISION.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.277
- HERE'S THE THING, O'HARA.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.811
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS GUY
IN, LIKE, SEVEN YEARS.

27:38.850 --> 27:41.216
YOU'RE BOTH
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.216
THE ONLY WAY
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW ANYTHING

27:43.260 --> 27:45.455
IS IF YOU GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

27:45.490 --> 27:48.391
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS PURE SPECULATION.

27:48.430 --> 27:50.762
IT'S LIKE--LIKE WONDERING
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

27:50.800 --> 27:52.495
IF KENICKIE HAD DRIVEN
AT THUNDER ROAD.

27:52.530 --> 27:54.760
- ARE WE STILL ON GREASE?

27:54.800 --> 27:56.688
- WE NEVER WEREN'T.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.246
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BREAK
THE WINDOW, SHAWN.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.577
- WHAT WAS I GONNA DO,

28:10.620 --> 28:12.508
CLIMB OVER
THE BARBED WIRE FENCE?

28:12.550 --> 28:13.983
- I'M JUST SAYING,

28:14.020 --> 28:15.885
THE DOOR'S BEEN SITTING HERE
FOR FIVE YEARS UNTOUCHED.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.285
THERE'S DECAY.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.129
- DECAY? THIS ISN'T
PLANET OF THE APES, GUS.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.923
- THIS WAS ACTUALLY
A VERY FORTIFIED BUILDING.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.758
WARING WAS BIG ON SECURITY,
SO YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.165
YOU GUYS ALWAYS DISAGREE
LIKE THIS?

28:25.200 --> 28:26.861
- ALWAYS.
- NOT ALWAYS.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.059
- IT'S WEIRD BEING IN HERE
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

28:32.110 --> 28:34.078
- SO THIS WAS WARING'S
LEGITIMATE BUSINESS FRONT.

28:34.110 --> 28:35.839
- AND YOU WEREN'T AWARE
OF ANY IMPROPRIETIES

28:35.880 --> 28:37.302
GOING ON WHATSOEVER?

28:37.340 --> 28:38.500
- DO YOU DOUBT ME, SHAWN?

28:38.550 --> 28:39.539
- NO.

28:39.580 --> 28:41.514
MAYBE A LITTLE.
- SHAWN.

28:41.550 --> 28:43.780
- I'M AN APPRAISER, SHAWN,
NOT A SMUGGLER.

28:43.820 --> 28:45.378
PLUS, I TURNED MY BOSS IN.

28:45.420 --> 28:46.785
I WAS THE ONLY ONE

28:46.820 --> 28:48.685
WHO COULD PLACE WARING
IN THE ROOM WITH THE BODY.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.415
- WHICH ROOM?
- WARING'S OFFICE.

28:50.460 --> 28:52.724
RIGHT OVER THERE.

28:55.460 --> 28:57.325
- THIS MUST BE
WHERE IT HAPPENED.

29:01.470 --> 29:02.869
- GUS, GET DOWN THERE.
BE THE BODY.

29:02.900 --> 29:03.969
- I'M NOT LAYING ON A FLOOR.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.136
- COME ON, MAN,
I'M ONTO SOMETHING.

29:05.170 --> 29:06.569
- THIS IS A $260 SHIRT.

29:06.610 --> 29:08.828
- YOU GOT THAT FOR 18 BUCKS.
- LIST PRICE, SHAWN.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.108
- YOU CANNOT QUOTE LIST PRICE.

29:10.140 --> 29:11.243
- THERE'S BLOOD ON THE FLOOR.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.599
- ARE YOU CRAZY?
THAT'S NOT BLOOD.

29:12.650 --> 29:14.242
THAT'S CLEARLY CRIME SCENE OIL.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.713
- I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF CRIME SCENE OIL.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.843
- THAT'S BECAUSE THEY STOPPED
USING IT IN THE MID-'7OS

29:17.890 --> 29:19.312
F.D.R. WAS LIKE,
"NOT IN MY HOUSE."

29:19.350 --> 29:21.454
- THAT MAKES NO SENSE, SHAWN.
- WHOSE DAD IS A COP?

29:21.490 --> 29:25.620
- WHY'S HE LAYING
IN THE POOL OF BLOOD?

29:25.660 --> 29:26.922
- HE WAS BEING THE BODY.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.599
- HE WAS LAYING
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION ANYWAY.

29:29.630 --> 29:33.589
- NO, SCOTT, I AM A PSYCHIC,
AND I AM SENSING THAT THE BODY

29:33.630 --> 29:34.961
WAS TURNED
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.433
- I THINK I REMEMBER IT
PRETTY CLEARLY.

29:36.470 --> 29:37.539
HIS HEAD WAS OVER THERE
BY THE WINDOW.

29:37.570 --> 29:38.935
I CAME IN THROUGH
THE BACK DOOR THERE,

29:38.970 --> 29:41.234
SAW WARING STANDING OVER THE
BODY WITH A GUN IN HIS HAND,

29:41.280 --> 29:43.032
AND THEN HE RAN
OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.548
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

29:45.580 --> 29:47.275
WHY DID THEY NEED YOU?

29:47.310 --> 29:49.619
COULDN'T THEY HAVE CONVICTED
HIM WITH THE BULLET?

29:49.650 --> 29:52.187
- NO, THE BULLET
WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE GUY.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.289
- AND THEY NEVER FOUND IT.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.015
DIDN'T YOU READ
THE TRIAL TRANSCRIPT?

29:55.060 --> 29:58.826
- YEAH, GUS, THAT WAS RIGHT AT
THE TOP OF MY "TO DON'T" LIST.

29:58.860 --> 30:00.487
- EXCUSE ME.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.092
SHAWN?
- YEAH?

30:03.130 --> 30:04.688
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP
DOUBTING THIS GUY.

30:04.730 --> 30:05.697
- [whispering]
I DON'T KNOW.

30:05.730 --> 30:07.027
NOTHING HE SAYS
HOLDS ANY WATER.

30:07.070 --> 30:08.298
- EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID

30:08.340 --> 30:09.796
IN THE LAST TWO DAYS
HAS BEEN WRONG.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.239
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT MR. T

30:11.270 --> 30:12.601
BEING AN EXTRA
IN THE BLUES BROTHERS.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.335
- I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE CASE, SHAWN.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.432
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.107
LET'S JUST SAY,
FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE,

30:19.150 --> 30:20.401
THAT YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:20.450 --> 30:23.578
THE BODY WAS THIS WAY,
AND THE HEAD WAS DOWN THERE.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.042
THAT WOULD MEAN...

30:31.060 --> 30:32.584
- THE BULLET
WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE GUY.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.188
[bullet thuds]

30:49.240 --> 30:51.049
- I THINK I KNOW
WHERE THE BULLET WENT.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.213
- YOU KNOW
THOSE ARE BACKWARDS?

30:56.250 --> 30:59.083
- WHAT?

30:59.120 --> 31:01.350
OH, MY--THAT MAKES ALL THE
DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD.

31:01.390 --> 31:03.085
- YOU'RE LOOKING TOO LOW,
SHAWN.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.326
- NO, I'M NOT.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.487
THAT WINDOW WAS 20 FEET
OFF THE GROUND, GUS.

31:06.530 --> 31:07.997
IF YOU'D READ
THE CORONER'S REPORT,

31:08.030 --> 31:09.725
YOU'D KNOW
THAT THE EXIT AND ENTRY WOUNDS

31:09.760 --> 31:11.159
ON THE VICTIM
WERE THE SAME HEIGHT.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.418
THAT MEANS THE BULLET TRAVELED
RELATIVELY STRAIGHT.

31:13.470 --> 31:15.165
SOMETIMES I HAVE TO HELP
MY PARTNER HERE

31:15.200 --> 31:16.667
WITH THE POLICE ASPECT
OF THINGS.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.258
- BUT YOU'RE NOT COMPENSATING
FOR THE HILL.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.436
- I MOST CERTAINLY AM.

31:19.470 --> 31:20.459
- BUT YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THE FOREST

31:20.510 --> 31:21.772
LIKE IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO.

31:21.810 --> 31:23.869
- YEAH, TREES GROW.

31:23.910 --> 31:25.343
- EXACTLY.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.681
- HOLY--

31:32.720 --> 31:34.312
IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

31:34.360 --> 31:35.952
- SHIMMY UP
A LITTLE HIGHER.

31:35.990 --> 31:37.685
STOP WORRYING ABOUT MESSING UP
YOUR FINGERNAILS.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.256
- THIS THING IS COVERED
WITH SAP, GUS,

31:39.290 --> 31:41.019
AND YOU KNOW I HAVE
VERY SENSITIVE CUTICLES,

31:41.060 --> 31:42.197
AND IF YOU'RE SO GREAT,

31:42.230 --> 31:43.857
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE
AND DO IT?

31:47.100 --> 31:51.799
GENTLEMEN, I THINK WE MAY HAVE
JUST FOUND OURSELVES A BULLET.

31:51.840 --> 31:53.603
[gunshot]

31:56.140 --> 31:58.643
WITH ME!
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING ME!

31:58.680 --> 32:00.272
- JUMP!
- IT'S TOO HIGH!

32:00.310 --> 32:01.379
- IT'S NOT THAT HIGH!

32:01.420 --> 32:03.047
BESIDES, THEY WANT SCOTT,
NOT YOU!

32:03.080 --> 32:06.288
- GAAH!

32:06.320 --> 32:07.389
[thud]

32:07.420 --> 32:10.082
OH! OHH!

32:10.120 --> 32:11.678
[sirens wailing]

32:13.590 --> 32:14.955
- THIS BETTER BE GOOD,
MR. SPENCER.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.093
- OH, IT'LL BE GOOD, CHIEF.
PLEASE.

32:17.130 --> 32:19.769
THERE IS A BULLET
IN THIS TREE.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.665
IT'S IN A TINY HOLE.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.100
YOU CANNOT SEE IT,
BUT MY SENSES HAVE LED US HERE.

32:24.140 --> 32:25.164
>> WE CAN SEE IT.

32:25.210 --> 32:26.438
NO, LASSIE, YOU NEED A LADDER

32:26.470 --> 32:28.938
OR A PSYCHIC THIRD EYE
TO SEE IT FROM THERE.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.834
LODGED DEEP IN THE TRUNK

32:30.880 --> 32:33.144
IS THE BULLET THAT KILLED
AGENT XAVIER RENFRO.

32:33.180 --> 32:35.410
- THAT'S NOT HIS NAME, SHAWN.

32:35.450 --> 32:36.610
- WE SEE THE HOLE.

32:36.650 --> 32:38.311
- NO, NO, JULES,
YOU'D NEED BINOCULARS

32:38.350 --> 32:39.385
TO SEE IT
FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT.

32:39.420 --> 32:40.944
- UH, SHAWN?

32:40.990 --> 32:42.389
- YES, GUS?

32:48.630 --> 32:51.497
OH, NO, SOMEONE MUST HAVE
GOTTEN HERE BEFORE US.

32:51.530 --> 32:52.565
- WHO?

32:52.600 --> 32:54.158
- THE REAL KILLER.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.076
- MR. SPENCER.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.881
YOU'VE REACHED A NEW LEVEL
OF RECKLESSNESS THIS WEEK,

33:13.920 --> 33:16.184
AND, UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S BECOME NECESSARY

33:16.220 --> 33:18.359
TO ISSUE YOU BOTH
FORMAL REPRIMANDS.

33:18.390 --> 33:20.278
- ON WHAT GROUNDS?

33:20.330 --> 33:23.788
- HOW ABOUT MISUSE
OF A FEDERAL DATABASE?

33:23.830 --> 33:25.889
INFORMING A CONVICTED CRIMINAL

33:25.930 --> 33:28.490
THAT HIS ACCUSER IS
OUT OF PROTECTION?

33:28.540 --> 33:29.859
TRESPASSING,

33:29.900 --> 33:31.731
AGREEING TO ASSIST
AN INCARCERATED MURDERER.

33:31.770 --> 33:33.601
- THESE ARE CRIMES?
WHAT IS THIS, NORTH KOREA?

33:33.640 --> 33:35.335
- I THINK THEY ALL ARE,
EXCEPT THE LAST ONE,

33:35.380 --> 33:36.438
WHICH IS JUST POOR JUDGMENT.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.004
- DID AGENT WAYNE
PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

33:38.050 --> 33:39.779
- HE WANTED CHARGES
BROUGHT AGAINST YOU.

33:39.810 --> 33:42.916
- I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU
ARE BOWING DOWN TO THIS MAN.

33:42.950 --> 33:44.315
CAN SOMEONE GIVE ME A REASON

33:44.350 --> 33:46.386
WHY HE IS SO OBSESSED
WITH THIS SILLY LITTLE CASE?

33:46.420 --> 33:48.786
- BECAUSE THE AGENT WHO DIED
IN THE RAID WAS HIS PARTNER.

33:48.820 --> 33:51.015
- WOW.
YOU SHOULD JUST STOP TALKING

33:51.060 --> 33:52.220
UNTIL THIS STREAK
BLOWS OVER.

33:52.260 --> 33:53.579
- MAY I SPEAK
WITH AGENT WAYNE, PLEASE?

33:53.630 --> 33:55.552
- AGENT WAYNE
IS ESCORTING A WITNESS

33:55.600 --> 33:57.750
TO A HANDLER TO GO BACK
INTO PROTECTION.

33:57.800 --> 33:58.994
- NOT SCOTT.
- YEAH.

33:59.030 --> 34:00.361
HE AGREED TO GO BACK IN.

34:00.400 --> 34:03.233
GETTING SHOT AT IN THE FOREST
WAS A REAL EYE-OPENER.

34:03.270 --> 34:05.101
AND, BESIDES,
YOU JUST MISSED HIM.

34:06.670 --> 34:07.739
- SCOTT!

34:07.770 --> 34:08.976
[tapping on glass]

34:09.010 --> 34:10.477
SCOTT!

34:18.950 --> 34:21.089
- YOU KNOW,
MR. SPENCER, NOW.

34:23.090 --> 34:24.887
- HOLY CRAP.

34:24.930 --> 34:26.158
IT WAS HIM.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.350
IT WAS--IT WAS WAYNE!

34:27.390 --> 34:29.119
HE'S THE ONE
THAT DUG THE BULLET OUT.

34:29.160 --> 34:32.095
- [laughs] HONESTLY,
YOU ARE SCRAPING

34:32.130 --> 34:33.427
THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL NOW.

34:33.470 --> 34:34.732
- YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.

34:34.770 --> 34:36.135
HE WAS THERE THE NIGHT
OF THE SHOOTING, WAS HE NOT?

34:36.170 --> 34:37.694
- YEAH, HE WAS.

34:37.740 --> 34:39.037
WHY DO YOU THINK HE'S
SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS CASE?

34:39.070 --> 34:40.662
- THAT IS NOT WHY
HE WAS SO PASSIONATE!

34:40.710 --> 34:42.871
SCOTT SEAVER DID NOT WITNESS
A MURDER.

34:42.910 --> 34:44.639
HE WITNESSED A COVER-UP.

34:44.680 --> 34:47.046
SOMEBODY MIGHT
WANT TO FOLLOW ME!

35:13.710 --> 35:15.337
[tires squeal]

35:41.670 --> 35:44.059
[tires screeching]

35:53.950 --> 35:56.339
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, SPENCER?

35:56.380 --> 35:57.916
I'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED.

35:57.950 --> 35:59.087
- THAT'S FUNNY.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.940
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
THE SAME THING TO YOU.

36:00.990 --> 36:02.685
- ON WHAT GROUNDS?

36:02.720 --> 36:06.019
- LET'S SEE HERE--
MURDER, ATTEMPTED MURDER,

36:06.060 --> 36:08.927
CONSPIRACY, UNLAWFUL CARVING
OF A SPRUCE TREE.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.097
- WHAT?

36:10.130 --> 36:12.394
- YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT DUG THE BULLET OUT--

36:12.430 --> 36:14.933
THE ONE THAT KILLED
YOUR PARTNER,

36:14.970 --> 36:17.962
THE ONE THAT CAME
FROM YOUR GUN.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.230
IT WAS YOU.
YOU DID IT.

36:24.780 --> 36:26.748
WAIT A SECOND.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.876
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
WASN'T IT?

36:29.920 --> 36:31.979
YOU SAW A GUN,
AND YOU SAW A FIGURE,

36:32.020 --> 36:34.045
AND YOU THOUGHT IT WAS WARING.

36:35.520 --> 36:38.250
THEN WARING CAME IN,
SAW THE BODY ON THE GROUND,

36:38.290 --> 36:40.121
AND PULLED HIS GUN.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.458
AND THAT'S WHEN SCOTT
CAME IN.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.388
HE FOUND WARING STANDING
OVER THE BODY,

36:44.430 --> 36:46.864
AND THEN SAW HIM
FLEE THE SCENE.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.629
WHEN YOU GOT TO THE ROOM,

36:48.670 --> 36:50.695
YOU REALIZED
YOUR HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

36:50.740 --> 36:53.038
YOUR PARTNER LAYING
LIFELESS ON THE GROUND,

36:53.070 --> 36:55.573
THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD HAVE
SHOT HIM WAS YOU.

36:55.610 --> 36:57.077
YOU REPOSITIONED THE BODY,

36:57.110 --> 36:58.646
MADE IT LOOK LIKE WARING
HAD SHOT HIM,

36:58.680 --> 37:01.001
AND THEN YOU PINNED
THE WHOLE THING ON WARING.

37:01.050 --> 37:03.075
MURDER CONVICTION
WAS A LOCK,

37:03.120 --> 37:05.145
FOLLOWED BY A LONG SENTENCE,
WHICH WARING DESERVED,

37:05.190 --> 37:07.078
BUT ALWAYS ELUDED,
BECAUSE OF HIS COOL DEMEANOR

37:07.120 --> 37:08.781
AND BILLY ZANE-IAN QUALITIES.

37:08.820 --> 37:10.583
I MEAN, LET'S BE HONEST,
THAT MAN HAS A PRESENCE.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.622
BUT PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY,

37:12.660 --> 37:15.026
IT MEANT YOUR PARTNER
AGENT RENFRO

37:15.060 --> 37:17.756
DIDN'T DIE IN VAIN.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.189
- I REALLY WISH
YOU HADN'T SAID THAT.

37:20.230 --> 37:23.199
- SORRY, WAYNE.
NO TAKE-BACKS.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.867
- [laughs]

37:24.910 --> 37:27.162
YOU KNOW,
GETTING RID OF HIM,

37:27.210 --> 37:29.030
THAT WAS GONNA BE EASY.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.344
YOU, MMM, NOT SO MUCH.

37:31.380 --> 37:32.972
- JUST LET IT GO, MAN.

37:33.010 --> 37:34.341
YOU'RE CLEARLY OUTNUMBERED.

37:34.380 --> 37:36.314
- REALLY?

37:41.590 --> 37:43.410
- GUESS THAT EVENS THINGS UP
A BIT.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.724
- YOU THINK SO?

37:46.760 --> 37:48.751
- OH, BOY.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.995
YOU'RE GONNA HIDE
BEHIND YOUR LITTLE GUN, HUH?

37:51.030 --> 37:52.918
COME ON, MAN.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.392
PUT THAT THING DOWN.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.761
TAKE ME ON MANO A MANO, HUH?

37:56.800 --> 37:58.563
JUST TWO DUDES
GOING AT IT.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.170
TWO UNEVENLY-MATCHED
DUDES, HUH?

38:01.210 --> 38:02.370
WHERE? WHERE AM I?

38:02.410 --> 38:03.638
YOU GONNA BE ABLE
TO BEND THOSE THINGS, HUH?

38:03.680 --> 38:05.079
CAN YOU BEND THOSE BULLETS?

38:05.110 --> 38:08.204
- YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS HATE WHEN
THEY MAKE THAT SPEECH IN MOVIES.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.013
I MEAN, WHO'S GONNA DROP
THEIR, YOU KNOW, GUN--

38:13.020 --> 38:14.214
- I'M NOT PROUD OF THAT.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.022
- [grunts]

38:19.060 --> 38:21.187
- [groans]

38:22.830 --> 38:25.321
SCOTT SEAVER WAS
A CONVENIENT WITNESS,

38:25.370 --> 38:27.326
RIGHT PLACE, WRONG TIME!

38:27.370 --> 38:29.133
-AAH! AAH!

38:29.170 --> 38:30.194
- [grunts]

38:33.210 --> 38:34.871
PUTTING HIM
IN WITNESS PROTECTION

38:34.910 --> 38:37.902
WOULD ENSURE THAT THERE WERE
NO QUESTIONS LEFT BEHIND!

38:39.910 --> 38:41.741
DUDE, DID YOU SEE
WHAT I JUST DID?

38:44.250 --> 38:45.786
[grunting]

38:50.320 --> 38:52.481
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KILL ME.

38:52.530 --> 38:53.781
YOU'RE NOT
A COLD-BLOODED MURDERER.

38:53.830 --> 38:55.752
OTHERWISE, YOU WOULD HAVE
KILLED SCOTT A LONG TIME AGO.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.928
- THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS,
I DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL HIM.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.267
- [groaning]

39:03.240 --> 39:05.868
AAH! OH!

39:07.910 --> 39:10.276
- [groans]

39:10.310 --> 39:11.402
- OH!

39:34.070 --> 39:35.264
THAN KS.

39:40.970 --> 39:42.699
- FEDERAL AGENT, YOU IDIOT.

39:42.740 --> 39:44.105
- NOT ANYMORE.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.853
- SO WHAT HAPPENED?

39:56.890 --> 40:00.348
- GAVE HIM
THE OL' MANO A MANO SPEECH.

40:00.390 --> 40:01.493
- DID IT WORK?

40:01.530 --> 40:03.122
- NOT EVEN SORT OF.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.491
- THEN WHAT?

40:04.530 --> 40:06.327
- HAD TO KNOCK HIM OUT, GUS.

40:06.370 --> 40:08.395
- I THOUGHT SCOTT
KNOCKED HIM OUT.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.135
- I'VE HEARD IT BOTH WAYS.

40:18.480 --> 40:23.144
- OH, SCOTT, I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

40:23.180 --> 40:25.546
I DIDN'T COME LOOKING FOR YOU
LAST WEEK.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.740
SHAWN DID,
ALL ON HIS OWN.

40:27.790 --> 40:29.189
- I KNOW.

40:29.220 --> 40:31.950
- YOU DO?

40:31.990 --> 40:33.958
- WELL, I GUESS I WAS
KIND OF HOPING IT WAS YOU.

40:33.990 --> 40:36.197
- WELL, I WOULD HAVE...

40:36.230 --> 40:40.326
IF I THOUGHT
YOU WERE REALLY IN TROUBLE.

40:40.370 --> 40:43.828
- SO, UH,
WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE US?

40:46.010 --> 40:47.204
- I'M NOT SURE.

40:48.940 --> 40:53.843
- SEEING YOU AGAIN
CHANGED SO MUCH IN MY LIFE.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.745
- ME TOO.

40:55.780 --> 41:00.046
- BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT MY LIFE IS RIGHT NOW.

41:00.090 --> 41:01.557
I MEAN,
I LOST FIVE YEARS OF IT.

41:01.590 --> 41:05.287
I GUESS,
SOMEDAY, I MIGHT, BUT...

41:05.330 --> 41:07.525
THE THING IS--
- HEY.

41:07.560 --> 41:10.256
I HAVE AN IDEA.

41:10.300 --> 41:14.418
HOW ABOUT IN THREE YEARS,

41:14.470 --> 41:16.461
WE MEET RIGHT BACK HERE?

41:19.270 --> 41:20.498
SAME TIME.

41:28.110 --> 41:33.013
[boarding announcement
on P.A.]

41:33.050 --> 41:34.210
- SEE YOU.

41:46.530 --> 41:47.997
ONE PROBLEM.

41:49.270 --> 41:51.738
THREE YEARS IS TOO LONG.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.306
- [laughs]

41:53.340 --> 41:54.364
WELL, HOW ABOUT TWO?

41:54.410 --> 41:56.378
- HOW ABOUT ONE?

41:57.680 --> 42:00.171
- SEE YOU THEN.
