            what's happening,

Because when joe calls,
you want me to tell him
that it's safe here.

            I'm here.
            Where are you?

10:17.784 --> 10:18.917
One block south.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.418
            What's happening?

10:20.420 --> 10:22.087
She's still walking.
How do you want to
handle this?

10:22.089 --> 10:23.822
        We'll figure it out.
        I'll be right with you.

10:33.132 --> 10:36.534
            Don't move,
            or I'll shoot you
            right in the leg.

10:36.536 --> 10:37.936
Je ne parle
pas anglais.

10:37.938 --> 10:41.139
            I think you
            understand english
            just fine.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.008
            Now come with me.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.378
Shoot me.
Shoot me.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.146
What do I have
to lose?

10:51.417 --> 10:52.617
    Oh, that hurt! Ohh!

10:52.619 --> 10:54.185
Oh, but it felt so good!

10:54.187 --> 10:56.388
            Let's move her
            before somebody
            sees us.

11:02.428 --> 11:03.461
                Morning.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.596
        Morning.

11:04.598 --> 11:05.797
        What's this?

11:05.799 --> 11:07.265
            It was flagged by
            our carroll alert.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.767
A murder victim found
in arkansas,

11:08.769 --> 11:10.635
A local prostitute
who was pen pals

11:10.637 --> 11:11.870
            With carroll
            while in prison.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.238
    Yeah. I remember her.
    She was on the list.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.539
    She was interviewed
    and cleared.

11:14.541 --> 11:15.540
    Do we have a suspect?

11:15.542 --> 11:16.941
            Reverend glen davis.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.910
        He and his vehicle
        haven't been seen since.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.812
            Also the woman's
            daughter is missing.

11:20.814 --> 11:21.980
        All right.
    Keep monitoring it.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.448
    If you get something,
        tell me.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.321
    Unh!

11:31.490 --> 11:34.125
            Morning, sunshine.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.828
            Don't bother.
            Everything's nailed
            down in this place.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.897
    Hoe you're not
    too uncomfortable,

11:38.899 --> 11:40.398
        But you kind of
        deserve it.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.900
    Let's cut to the chase.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.669
    Where's lily gray? Hmm?

11:44.671 --> 11:48.039
    See, my uncle here
    thinks find lily gray,

11:48.041 --> 11:49.874
    He'll find joe carroll.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.644
            Je ne comprends pas.

11:52.646 --> 11:54.145
        What? Huh?

11:54.147 --> 11:55.914
    Please. No one is buying
    the "je comprends.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.049
    I don't speak english"
        routine.

11:59.418 --> 12:02.487
            Hello.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.290
            You come prepared.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.393
            So what do you
            think is gonna
            happen here?

12:14.266 --> 12:16.134
    Man on tv: Lily gray killed
        two federal agents

12:16.136 --> 12:18.870
    At her soho art gallery--

12:18.872 --> 12:20.972
            See that? Lily
            is the headline

12:20.974 --> 12:23.308
            On every single
            news channel,

12:23.310 --> 12:24.876
            And soon we are
            gonna know
            everything

12:24.878 --> 12:27.078
            There is to know
            about you and her

12:27.080 --> 12:28.513
            And the psycho
            twins,

12:28.515 --> 12:30.048
            And this is all
            gonna end,

12:30.050 --> 12:33.218
            But that doesn't
            have to happen
            if you talk to me.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.057
        Maybe you can
        help me with this
        little dilemma

12:39.059 --> 12:40.959
        That I'm having here.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.229
        Max here,
        she's a do-gooder.

12:44.231 --> 12:47.031
        She wants to do
        the right thing.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.567
        Me--I'm not interested
        in the right thing.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.337
        I'm interested
        in one thing--

12:52.339 --> 12:57.041
        Not you, not lily,
        not the twins.

12:57.043 --> 13:01.379
        Joe carroll.
        You understand?

13:01.381 --> 13:06.184
        Joe carroll
        killed someone
        very dear to me,

13:06.186 --> 13:09.687
        And what I want
        is simple.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.023
        I want to kill
        joe carroll.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.312
            [sighs]

13:37.016 --> 13:41.586
            I'm ashamed for what
            I did to you.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.987
            My actions
            were selfish.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.522
        In fact, everything
        I did in havenport

13:44.524 --> 13:48.626
        Was wrong and selfish

13:48.628 --> 13:51.129
        I am so very sorry.

13:53.899 --> 13:56.134
When I lost you...

13:58.737 --> 14:02.373
I contacted anyone
I could I find.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.210
The fbi was hunting us,
we had to hide.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.045
We lived in a rat hole,

14:07.047 --> 14:09.414
Frightened
to go outside.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.816
            So there are others
            still out there?

14:11.818 --> 14:17.055
No. They're all dead
or locked up.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.157
There's just me.

14:20.926 --> 14:24.429
            It's you and me.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.564
            We're here...

14:26.566 --> 14:29.400
            Together.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.803
        Lily went
        to a great deal
        of trouble to find me.

14:31.805 --> 14:37.141
            She--she can't
            mean us harm.

14:37.143 --> 14:40.178
They're crazy.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.180
Have you not noticed

14:42.182 --> 14:47.285
They are all crazy?

14:47.287 --> 14:50.822
            I know I have no
            right to ask
            for another chance.

14:50.824 --> 14:56.661
            Now please, emma,
            I have a plan.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.163
            I know a way
            we can start over.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.543
            Joe seems cool.

15:12.545 --> 15:16.681
Heh. I haven't spent
5 minutes alone with him.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.784
Certainly could do
without that emma
lurking about.

15:19.786 --> 15:23.121
            Don't be mean.
            I like her.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.960
You have such
a big heart, dear.

15:28.962 --> 15:33.231
You like everyone.

15:33.233 --> 15:38.569
            Give her a chance.
            Please.

15:38.571 --> 15:42.040
For you, of course.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.241
Tell you what.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.643
Why don't you
do me a favor

15:45.645 --> 15:47.245
And occupy her?

15:47.247 --> 15:51.749
I want to spend
some time with joe
without interruption.

15:51.751 --> 15:55.520
Will you do that
for your mom?

15:55.522 --> 15:56.788
            Sure.

16:02.428 --> 16:04.762
        Ryan: I know what
        lily is doing.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.030
        She's completing
        a family.

16:06.032 --> 16:07.298
    It was obvious
    in the twins' moves,

16:07.300 --> 16:08.533
    But here's the thing.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.602
        Joe--he's not
        a family guy.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.838
    Do you know what he did
    to the last woman

16:13.840 --> 16:15.740
    That he truly loved?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.375
    He had her killed.

16:17.377 --> 16:21.279
    He abandoned his followers
    to be picked off one by one.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.681
            Ryan, she's not
            gonna cooperate.

16:29.955 --> 16:32.523
    Joe's gonna kill you
        and lily

16:32.525 --> 16:34.892
    And everyone else
    that you care about.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.095
        Let's not worry
        about that now.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.030
        I'm gonna make
        a deal with you.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.599
        Lily and her
        little clan

16:41.601 --> 16:44.002
    Can ride off into
    the sunset scott free

16:44.004 --> 16:47.438
    I don't want them.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.875
        I want joe.

16:50.877 --> 16:55.079
        I want to drive
        an ice pick
        through is brain,

16:55.081 --> 16:57.181
    But if you don't
    cooperate with me,

16:57.183 --> 17:01.119
    Max here is gonna make
        one phone call,

17:01.121 --> 17:06.023
    And the fbi is going to
    explode into this town.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.760
    Is that what you want?

17:08.762 --> 17:09.394
        Because...

17:12.830 --> 17:15.165
    Something tells me...

17:15.167 --> 17:17.835
    That home, sweet, home

17:17.837 --> 17:19.804
        Is very close by.

17:23.474 --> 17:25.175
        Am I right?

17:27.613 --> 17:28.880
[spits]

17:34.019 --> 17:35.186
[gasps]

17:35.188 --> 17:36.721
            All right.
            That's it.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.457
            I'm calling it in.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.492
[choking]

17:41.494 --> 17:43.795
            Ryan, that's enough!
            Get off of her!

17:43.797 --> 17:45.129
            Get off of her,
            ryan!

17:45.131 --> 17:47.031
            Enough, ryan!
            Get off of her!

17:47.033 --> 17:49.200
            Stop it! Ryan!

17:49.202 --> 17:50.568
            Ryan,
            you promised me!

17:50.570 --> 17:51.736
            Stop it!

17:51.738 --> 17:55.073
            Ryan,
            you promised me!

17:55.075 --> 17:56.974
Ohh!

17:56.976 --> 17:59.444
[coughing]

18:06.218 --> 18:08.586
        Yes. This is
    detective max hardy.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.888
Wait. Ok, ok.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.357
I'll make a deal
with you.

18:13.359 --> 18:16.260
I'll tell you
where they are.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.430
They're at the factory
on bone's road.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.433
Good performance.
You had me scared
for a minute.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.901
            Had to make it
            convincing.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.503
            You weren't bad
            yourself.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.038
You think she fell
for it?

18:27.040 --> 18:28.239
            She's twitchy.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.974
            She doesn't want
            the fbi here.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.309
            We're close.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.710
Yeah, but a factory
on bone's road?

18:32.712 --> 18:34.145
I'm just not buying it.
It's too easy.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.613
Do you really think
lily's there?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.115
            Somebody will be.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.249
            I'm gonna
            scope it out.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.650
Hey. You could
be ambushed.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.919
            Which is why I need
            you to stay here
            with her.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.421
No. I'm gonna go
with you.

18:43.423 --> 18:47.592
            Uh-uh. She's
            the only leverage
            I have, ok?

18:51.096 --> 18:53.731
She didn't deny
joe carroll was alive.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.155
Where are we going?

19:17.157 --> 19:20.291
            You'll see.

19:20.293 --> 19:23.127
Where's your
worse half?

19:23.129 --> 19:27.198
            Oh. Luke? He's
            picking up giselle.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.933
Are they an item?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.768
            No. Just close.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.755
This is
my mother's studio.

19:50.757 --> 19:53.324
I thought you'd like
to see it.

19:55.260 --> 19:59.063
    But your mother is
    an art dealer.

19:59.065 --> 20:02.266
            True, but...

20:02.268 --> 20:05.069
I know you're
an artist.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.871
I read about you
in that book,

20:06.873 --> 20:09.006
"the havenport tragedy."

20:12.778 --> 20:17.348
How come you never
went to art school?

20:17.350 --> 20:20.952
            My mother.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.820
That's sad.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.659
Oh. Come on.

20:30.996 --> 20:32.496
Let's create!

in the car?

38:22.934 --> 38:23.900
            A man and a girl.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.268
            Now the girl's been
            identified

38:25.270 --> 38:26.536
            As the victim's
            daughter.

38:34.179 --> 38:35.412
            Didn't have
            a brother.

            this is related
