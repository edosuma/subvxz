00:23.891 --> 00:26.258
(soft music)

00:43.477 --> 00:45.544
(fan rattling)

01:10.004 --> 01:11.103
(knocking on door)

01:11.105 --> 01:13.105
- Mike, I need you.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.807
- What's up?

01:14.808 --> 01:16.508
- Some asshole on 42
wants to see the manager.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.610
They say the food's all wrong,
I'm all wrong,

01:18.612 --> 01:19.878
just a bunch of fucking jerks.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.614
(group chatter)

01:23.517 --> 01:25.951
(soft music)

01:29.123 --> 01:30.456
- Hi, can I be of help?

01:30.458 --> 01:31.557
- Yeah, you the manager here?

01:31.559 --> 01:32.524
- I am.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.725
My name's Mike.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.461
- Well Jesus, where
do I even start.

01:35.463 --> 01:38.097
Okay, first of all,
we specifically did not order guacamole.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.898
What do you call that?

01:39.900 --> 01:42.401
- I'm so sorry, let me
get this out of your way.

01:42.403 --> 01:43.769
- The beans weren't even hot.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.205
And my wife, she ordered
Midori pineapple sour

01:46.207 --> 01:48.774
and neither one of us
can taste the alcohol.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.443
- You know what, I can have
the bartender make another,

01:51.445 --> 01:53.212
or better yet, I
can make one myself.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.213
- No, you know what.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.214
It's too late.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.549
Just forget it.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.883
Okay, we'll take the check.
Thank you very much.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.252
And I don't think that you'll be
seeing us in here any time soon.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.520
- I'm so sorry.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.389
- Yeah, damn right you are.

02:04.391 --> 02:07.659
- Let me take care
of the check for you.

02:09.729 --> 02:10.729
- Well, alright.

02:10.731 --> 02:11.797
You should.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.332
But what you really should do

02:13.334 --> 02:15.501
is you should give us some
free coupons for next time.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.336
- For next time?

02:17.338 --> 02:20.072
- Yeah. Yeah, you want to keep
your customers happy, don't you.

02:20.074 --> 02:23.142
- I'm sorry, you weren't
happy with your food

02:23.144 --> 02:24.243
or your service,

02:24.245 --> 02:25.244
so you'd like

02:25.246 --> 02:27.246
credit for the next time?

02:30.351 --> 02:32.301
- Yes I do.

02:32.302 --> 02:34.252
- Let me take care
of the check for you.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.254
- Fine.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.421
We're leaving.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.657
And you, Mark.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.958
- Mike.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.193
- Whatever, you will
not be seeing us

02:41.195 --> 02:42.594
in your establishment again.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.962
Thank you very much.

02:43.964 --> 02:44.963
Awful.

02:44.965 --> 02:45.864
Awful.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.735
- Safe home now.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.970
- What'd he say?

02:51.972 --> 02:52.771
- Nothing, you were
right, total jackass.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.772
- I told you so.

02:53.774 --> 02:54.840
What'd you do?

02:54.842 --> 02:55.974
- I comped him.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.442
- Fuck man.

02:57.444 --> 02:58.810
The fucking assholes.

02:58.812 --> 02:59.845
- They were.

02:59.847 --> 03:00.879
- So you just give them the--

03:00.881 --> 03:01.747
- Order.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.183
- You just give
them a free meal.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.450
- They're gone, right.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.652
- Fuck them.

03:06.654 --> 03:07.653
- Language.

03:07.655 --> 03:08.687
Language.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.889
- Now they're gonna yelp my ass.
- It's okay.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.124
- They're gonna yelp
the whole fucking place.

03:12.126 --> 03:13.158
- You'll be fine.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.326
- Fuck that.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.994
- You'll survive.

03:15.996 --> 03:16.995
- Not to mention no tip.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.564
No fucking tip,

03:18.566 --> 03:19.665
and that fucker is running me.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.366
- Junior, Junior, just calm down.
Let it go.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.201
Breathe deep.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.036
- [Waitress] Coming out.

03:28.642 --> 03:29.641
- Mike, I love you man,

03:29.643 --> 03:30.809
but this is so lame.

03:30.811 --> 03:31.977
- Junior, I love you man,

03:31.979 --> 03:33.312
get back to work.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.379
- Fuck this.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.748
Fucking bullshit.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.052
- Yo, Jake.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.320
- [Jake] Mike.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.721
- [Mike] Can I get a
Midori pineapple sour,

03:42.723 --> 03:44.323
extra strong please.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.324
- You fucking kidding me?

03:45.326 --> 03:47.259
- Yes, I'm kidding.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.193
- Good, cause some piece of shit just
sent one of those back a little while ago.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.229
- I heard.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.297
- You heard?

03:51.298 --> 03:52.364
- Don't worry about
it, you're fine.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.398
- Everybody I got a birthday.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.800
- Okay, birthday.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.201
- Yeah, it's the gay couple
with their granddaughter.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.437
- I got to blow off some
fucking steam in here.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.439
- Okay, table 33 follow me.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.642

One, two, three, four,

- Dude.
- Yeah?

04:28.202 --> 04:29.735
- That was dope.
I grabbed the liners,

04:29.737 --> 04:31.203
I was throwing them
all over the place.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.038
- I know.
I caught them all.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.473
- You caught them all?
- Every one.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.374
- Nice.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.545
- [Junior] Man, I need new shoes.
These things are killing me.

04:40.547 --> 04:42.080
- [Waitress] You need new shoes

04:42.082 --> 04:43.048
because those stink
to high heaven

04:43.050 --> 04:44.549
and should be incinerated.

04:44.551 --> 04:45.384
- You think?

04:45.386 --> 04:46.218
- Uh huh.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.052
- Shut up.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.588
(phone ringing)

04:49.590 --> 04:50.589
Hey.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.590
Hey babe.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.758
Oh shit, that's now?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.559
Oh yeah, yeah, I'm on my way.

04:54.561 --> 04:55.894
Uh huh.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.729
Hey Mike, my drop all good?

04:57.731 --> 04:58.764
- You're all set.

04:58.766 --> 04:59.931
- I gotta jet.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.833
- [Mike] Alright buddy.
- [Waitress] Bye.

05:01.835 --> 05:02.968
- Later dude.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.369
- Later skaters.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.905
- I'll clock you out.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.174
- Hey Mike, can
you clock me out?

05:09.176 --> 05:10.342
- You got it.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.576
- Thanks boss.

05:12.246 --> 05:14.579
I still can't believe you
comped those jag offs.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.314
Adios.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.082
- Adios.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.517
- Come on, baby.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.751
- You wish.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.486
- I do wish, that's
why I keep asking.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.088
- Uh uh, take a
walk Ponyboy,

05:23.090 --> 05:24.489
you had your chance.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.824
- Krissie, baby, please.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.658
- [Kris] Sorry bud.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.660
- It wasn't my fault.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.162
Just a teensy
little peak, please?

05:30.164 --> 05:32.097
- You're such an animal.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.432
- [Jake] You bring it out of me.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.834
- [Mike] You're all good, did you clock out?
- Uh huh, of course.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.735
Okay.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.340
I bid you goodnight gentlemen.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.709
And I do use the term loosely.

05:43.711 --> 05:44.876
- Don't forget your bag.

05:44.878 --> 05:45.877
- Oh, what bag?

05:45.879 --> 05:47.279
- This isn't your bag?

05:47.281 --> 05:49.281
- Nope.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.048
Ah.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.350
Comic books.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.818
- Comic books?

05:52.820 --> 05:56.355
- Oh, it's probably Junior's.
He's in to all that comic book shit.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.956
- [Kris] I'm outie.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.324
- [Jake] Bye.

05:59.326 --> 06:00.459
- [Kris] Hey Ponyboy.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.460
- [Jake] Yes my darling.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.828
- Sweet dreams.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.629
- Come on, please.

06:04.631 --> 06:05.731
That was just mean.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.833
Borderline sexual harassment.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.469
Sexually frustrating at least.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.938
(soft music)

07:00.621 --> 07:02.788
- [Man] Grow the fuck up.

07:07.861 --> 07:08.760
Mark my words.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.761
- [Woman] No.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.862
- [Man] What?

07:10.864 --> 07:11.696
Really?

07:11.698 --> 07:12.531
It ain't?

07:12.533 --> 07:13.365
Why not?

07:13.367 --> 07:14.399
- Hey amigo.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.300
- Hi Mike.

07:16.403 --> 07:19.805
(yelling in background)

07:19.807 --> 07:21.773
- How goes it?

07:21.775 --> 07:22.674
- Good.

07:24.912 --> 07:25.977
- [Mike] What you doing?

07:25.979 --> 07:26.878
- Nothing.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.181
- Cool.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.118
Nice night.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.286
- [Kid] Yeah.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.456
- Nice night to just

07:37.458 --> 07:39.224
sit outside and hang, right.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.125
- I guess.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.565
- [Man] Then why you
acting like such a psycho?

07:46.567 --> 07:47.466
- Your mom home?

07:49.403 --> 07:52.070
She with Andre?

07:52.072 --> 07:53.238
That's her boyfriend's
name, right?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.539
- [Kid] Uh huh.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.011
- Okay.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.648
Well, I'll leave you be.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.051
Goodnight buddy.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.154
- [Kid] Goodnight.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.723
(dog barking)

08:16.363 --> 08:18.263
- Lighten up, Francis.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.568
Good morning buddy.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.105
(soft music)

09:12.352 --> 09:14.085
- [Man] I think to myself,

09:14.086 --> 09:15.819
if you had a fraction of a fraction of
a fraction of a fraction of my brain,

09:15.822 --> 09:17.255
you wouldn't make half the moves.
What are you doing?

09:17.257 --> 09:18.823
Put that away.
Those are the instructions.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.092
Okay, I'd rather you figure out
the hard way and die 10 times.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.361
That's embarrassing.
You can't put that out in the tournament.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.063
Why you throwing down?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.665
Does that make any sense?

09:26.667 --> 09:27.832
Does it make any sense?

09:27.834 --> 09:29.100
You tell him.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.869
Don't tell me you don't
know what you're doing.

09:30.871 --> 09:31.903
That works.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.173
Really?

09:35.175 --> 09:36.608
You're gonna put this out now?

09:36.610 --> 09:39.411
That's like making
your first move.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.478
It's better.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.683
We're better people
than chess players.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.551
- Open your eyes
and your brains,

09:46.553 --> 09:47.719
keep your mouth shut.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.220
You might learn something.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.689
Pause.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.690
Hi.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.691
- Hi.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.758
- What is this?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.193
Oh, Capitan, nice.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.361
- Yeah, yeah.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.530
I'm just kind of
discovering him now.

09:58.532 --> 09:59.531
- Oh yeah?

09:59.533 --> 10:00.532
- Yeah.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.033
- You know, he has
a trade paperback.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.569
You can get these issues plus a
few more and it'd be way cheaper.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.571
And it wouldn't
have that lame ass

10:06.573 --> 10:09.541
storyline of where he's
training his cousin in Thailand.

10:09.543 --> 10:11.409
That is a bullshit
shoehorn of a storyline.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.477
- Okay.

10:12.479 --> 10:13.545
You said trade,

10:13.547 --> 10:14.579
trade paperback?

10:14.581 --> 10:15.580
- Trade paperback, yeah,

10:15.582 --> 10:17.048
it's a collect, you know, okay.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.451
Here, I'll show you.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.952
- Okay.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.953
Thank you.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.388
- [Man] Clark.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.389
- [Clark] No comments please.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.290
- Comments?

10:25.292 --> 10:26.124
- Yeah.

10:26.126 --> 10:26.958
Clark the clerk,

10:26.960 --> 10:27.892
Clark Kent,

10:27.894 --> 10:28.810
last train to Clarksville,

10:28.811 --> 10:29.727
Clark Clark, Dick Clark,
all the Clarks,

10:29.730 --> 10:31.563
all the every Clark,
I've heard them all.

10:31.565 --> 10:33.064
- [Mike] Okay, okay.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.733
- So here, it's rather
impressive actually.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.135
I'm more of an individual
issue guy myself,

10:37.137 --> 10:39.270
but if you're
looking to catch up,

10:39.272 --> 10:40.505
it's a great one oh
one crash course.

10:40.507 --> 10:41.873
- Cool.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.240
- Oh, and you neglected to
pull the brothers issue.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.176
That's the introduction
of Kitt Vixxen.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.412
- Oh god, she's--

10:47.414 --> 10:48.747
- Ridiculously sexy, I know.

10:48.749 --> 10:49.814
- Yeah, she is.

10:49.816 --> 10:50.815
- No, no, she's--

10:50.817 --> 10:51.683
- Yeah.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.822
- Ah hah, here we go.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.591
Like I said, less expensive,

10:59.593 --> 11:00.959
none of that Thailand bull piss.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.093
- Oh yeah.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.361
Cool man, thanks.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.996
- Yeah, and plenty
of Kitt Vixxen,

11:04.998 --> 11:06.264
if you know what I mean.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.599
- Yeah.

11:07.601 --> 11:08.633
- Yeah.

11:08.635 --> 11:09.868
- Yeah.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.136
- So what turned you on?

11:11.138 --> 11:12.837
- I beg your pardon?

11:12.839 --> 11:14.773
- To Captain Black,

11:14.775 --> 11:15.807
what turned you on?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.108
- Oh, oh, oh, you know,

11:17.110 --> 11:18.109
I don't know.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.377
It just kind of,

11:19.379 --> 11:20.612
it just kind of fell
on my lap, you know.

11:20.614 --> 11:21.980
- Oh, I love that.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.114
I love it when guys your age

11:23.116 --> 11:24.215
slash demographic

11:24.217 --> 11:25.483
get into the good stuff.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.618
- Nice, yeah.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.287
(soft music)

11:29.288 --> 11:30.954
Junior, I hope you don't mind.
I read some of those last night.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.190
- [Junior] Yeah?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.392
What'd you think?
- I liked it, I liked it a lot.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.660
But that Kitt Vixxen.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.896
- She's banging, bro.

11:37.898 --> 11:38.963
Smoking hot.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.200
- Yeah, she's banging.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.305
- Wait a minute, just
whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.573
Just look at you.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.241
You blushing?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.309
- What?

11:51.311 --> 11:52.310
- Yeah, you're blushing.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.645
You fucking pervert.
- What?

11:53.647 --> 11:55.213
- You got a woodrow
for a comic book chick?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.481
- No, I don't.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.649
- Yes you do, you
frigging sicko.

11:57.651 --> 11:58.817
- Please.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.085
- I get it, I get it.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.187
She's a smoke show.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.321
But you understand,

12:03.323 --> 12:05.423
she's not real, right?

12:05.425 --> 12:07.158
I mean you're aware that
she's a piece of fiction.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.159
- Yes, I aware of that.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.828
I just like the cartoon.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.895
- Comic.

12:10.897 --> 12:11.996
- What?

12:11.998 --> 12:12.997
- Comic.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.549
- You said cartoon.

12:14.550 --> 12:16.100
- Comic. I like the
comic, I like the comic.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.435
Captain Black, he's,

12:17.437 --> 12:18.603
he's

12:18.605 --> 12:19.704
cool,

12:19.706 --> 12:21.005
and righteous,

12:21.007 --> 12:22.006
and tough.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.174
He's,

12:23.176 --> 12:24.175
he's dark,

12:24.177 --> 12:25.577
but he's decent.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.178
I like him.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.179
I like him a lot.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.180
- Cool.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.215
- Yeah, it's cool, it's cool.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.683
- Nice.
- Yeah.

12:31.685 --> 12:33.451
- You still want to bang a
comic book chick character.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.285
- Shut up.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.286
Go to work.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.855
Fix your tie.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.523
- So, you're coming to my
Halloween party, right?

12:38.525 --> 12:40.925
- Um, you know I haven't
really made up my mind yet.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.427
- Come on.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.928
It's classic.
We had like a hundred people last year.

12:43.930 --> 12:44.929
- It's a thought.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.231
- We can go together.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.232
We can go as a couple,

12:47.234 --> 12:48.533
cause I'm gonna be

12:48.535 --> 12:49.934
strong caveman, and
you can be my Wilma.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.703
- Your Wilma?

12:51.705 --> 12:53.538
That's rich.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.539
- Mikey, would you please

12:54.541 --> 12:56.241
tell this young lady

12:56.243 --> 12:58.042
that we would be
a perfect couple?

12:58.044 --> 12:59.744
- Kris, darling,

12:59.746 --> 13:01.279
I think you'd be
a wonderful Wilma,

13:01.281 --> 13:03.548
whether or not you
want to be his Wilma

13:03.550 --> 13:05.216
is entirely up to you.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.217
- You could be our Barney.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.218
It's perfect.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.052
The three of us,

13:08.054 --> 13:08.887
let's do it.

13:08.889 --> 13:09.721
Let's go together.

13:09.723 --> 13:10.555
- You going Mike?

13:10.557 --> 13:11.422
- It's a thought.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.324
It's a thought.
- Oh, is it?

13:13.326 --> 13:15.393
- I'm considering the proposition.
- Okay.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.127
I'll tell you what.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.061
Mike goes,

13:17.063 --> 13:18.963
I could be persuaded.

13:18.965 --> 13:19.964
- [Mike] Me?

13:19.966 --> 13:21.166
- Yeah.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.801
You bring class to
this band of heathens.

13:22.803 --> 13:23.902
- What night?

13:23.904 --> 13:25.136
- Saturday night.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.038
Night off, no excuses.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.307
- I'm in.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.309
- [Jake] You're in?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.911
- Yeah, I'm in.

13:32.913 --> 13:33.912
Why not.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.113
But I'm not Barney.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.114
- Awesome.

13:36.116 --> 13:36.948
And,

13:36.950 --> 13:37.916
and you?

13:37.918 --> 13:39.617
- Well, if Mike is going,

13:39.619 --> 13:41.753
I guess I can make
an appearance.

13:41.755 --> 13:42.954
- That's what I'm talking about.

13:42.956 --> 13:43.955
That's,

13:43.957 --> 13:44.989
that's people helping people.

13:44.991 --> 13:45.990
Fucking-A.

13:45.992 --> 13:46.991
- Oh, fucking-A.

13:46.993 --> 13:47.826
- Shots, three.

13:47.828 --> 13:48.660
- Oh, shots.

13:48.662 --> 13:49.594
- Shots.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.495
Wait a minute.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.496
- I'll ring them up, Jesus.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.864
- Okay.

13:52.866 --> 13:53.832
- Oh buddy.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.101
Alright.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.370
Yabba dabba doobie.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.840
- [Group] Yabba dabba doobie.

14:05.779 --> 14:08.279
(soft music)

14:12.185 --> 14:14.285
- Hey Trace.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.186
- Hey.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.595
- Nice night.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.363
- Yeah.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.238
- Hey,

14:34.741 --> 14:37.976
what happened to
your eye, I mean?

14:37.978 --> 14:38.877
- Oh,

14:40.313 --> 14:42.013
I fell off my bike.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.215
(soft music)

14:44.217 --> 14:45.149
- Sorry.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.084
- [Tracey] Yeah.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.586
(soft music)

14:53.193 --> 14:54.325
- Didn't you,

14:56.263 --> 14:59.497
didn't you fall off your
bike a couple months ago?

15:01.735 --> 15:04.335
- You calling me clumsy, Mike?

15:04.337 --> 15:05.270
- No.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.738
No, I'm sorry, I,

15:08.341 --> 15:09.240
goodnight.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.378
- [Tracey] Hey.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.279
- Yeah.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.916
- Your shoe's untied.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.824
(slow suspenseful music)

15:32.799 --> 15:33.865
- [Mike] Life is precious.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.266
Life is fragile.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.703
Be your own ally.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.272
(dog barking)

15:42.208 --> 15:44.676
(soft music)

16:12.839 --> 16:13.738
Whoa.

16:14.908 --> 16:17.909
(soft music)

16:17.911 --> 16:20.511
(upbeat music)

18:00.113 --> 18:01.546
This is awesome.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.248
(upbeat music)

18:07.220 --> 18:08.619
Life is precious.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.021
Life is fragile.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.659
Be your own ally.

18:15.962 --> 18:16.861
Life

18:17.697 --> 18:19.530
is precious.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.932
Life is fragile.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.602
Be your own ally.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.439
(laughter)

18:28.441 --> 18:30.108
Life--

18:30.110 --> 18:32.043
(glass breaking)

18:32.045 --> 18:33.044
- [Tracey] Son of a bitch.

18:33.046 --> 18:35.580
(yelling)

18:35.582 --> 18:36.881
- [Boyfriend] What the
fuck is wrong with you?

18:36.883 --> 18:38.082
Are you friggin nuts?

18:38.084 --> 18:40.485
Have you completely
lost your fucking mind?

18:40.487 --> 18:43.054
(cat meowing)

18:44.891 --> 18:45.790
- Oh shit.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.393
(dramatic music)

19:10.116 --> 19:12.116
Captain Black
rescues cat on roof.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.151
Film at 11.

19:19.092 --> 19:20.658
Gatito was stuck on the roof.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.659
- [Austin] Yeah.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.927
- Yeah.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.362
I got him down,
no problem though.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.930
- Cool.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.265
- [Boyfriend] I'll
tell you what,

19:27.267 --> 19:29.133
it's going to be a real punk.

19:29.135 --> 19:32.303
(yelling in background)

19:32.305 --> 19:33.271
- So you're

19:34.274 --> 19:36.574
just hanging out here then?

19:38.344 --> 19:39.777
I'm gonna give the cat some tuna

19:39.779 --> 19:41.012
if you want to help.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.013
- I'm fine.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.314
Thanks.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.348
- Okay.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.249
Okay.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.555
- [Austin] Hey Mike.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.789
- Yeah.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.892
- Do you have any
brothers or sisters?

19:58.965 --> 20:01.799
- Yeah I do.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.201
I have a sister.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.070
We,

20:07.707 --> 20:09.340
we don't really

20:09.342 --> 20:10.975
talk to each other.

20:12.745 --> 20:13.711
- How come?

20:15.348 --> 20:17.582
- Yeah, it's a long story.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.751
- [Austin] That's too bad.

20:20.753 --> 20:21.652
- Yeah.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.225
- So why are you
dressed like that?

20:27.227 --> 20:28.326
- Oh, this is just a thing.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.261
I'm going to a party.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.997
I was just trying
it on for size.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.398
- [Austin] Cool.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.001
- So everything's okay then?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.703
- [Austin] Yeah.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.338
- Yeah?

20:40.340 --> 20:41.739
- [Austin] Yeah.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.507
- Okay.

20:45.878 --> 20:46.744
Alright, amigo.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.279
I'll leave you be.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.248
- See ya.

20:51.251 --> 20:52.450
- Hey, Austin,

20:53.953 --> 20:56.187
be your own ally.

20:56.189 --> 20:58.889
You ever hear that expression?

20:58.891 --> 21:00.558
- [Austin] No.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.860
- Pretty cool, though, huh.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.862
- [Austin] I guess.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.097
- I'll see you.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.133
- Something low cut,
you know what I mean,

21:09.135 --> 21:11.035
but you should see what the
chicks wear to this party.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.237
It's like everything's hot.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.238
The zombie's hot.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.959

absolutely right.

39:22.961 --> 39:25.462
Yes. - I tried to clean up
for like three hours straight,

39:25.464 --> 39:28.298
didn't even make a dent in the place.
- That was, that was.

39:28.300 --> 39:29.532
- Yeah, off the charts.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.867
It's the best party ever.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.308

39:38.310 --> 39:39.342
Sergeant Blackstar or
something like that?

40:06.371 --> 40:07.771

40:07.773 --> 40:09.005
as Captain Black.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.557
- No.

40:10.558 --> 40:12.108
I don't know man.
I was like three shades of shitfaced.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.377
- So you don't know who she was?
- [Jake] No, sorry.

40:14.379 --> 40:15.445
- I figured.

40:16.348 --> 40:19.115
- I mean did you get her info?

40:19.117 --> 40:21.184
- No, no, no, she split
before I even got her name.

40:21.186 --> 40:22.986
- [Jake] She smoking?

40:24.689 --> 40:25.889
- Grass?

40:25.891 --> 40:27.190
- No, not smoking
grass, whatever.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.725
Everybody was smoking.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.026
No, smoking hot.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.194
- Oh yeah, oh god yes.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.195
Oh, that smoking.

Yes very much so.

41:11.436 --> 41:12.769
- No, I never saw her before.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.437
She's pretty.

41:14.439 --> 41:15.438
- Yeah.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.439
- What's her name?

41:16.441 --> 41:18.141
- Good question.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.577
- No name?

41:20.579 --> 41:21.578
Scandalous.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.146
- Okay, I'll be in the office.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.482

(holiday music playing)

43:43.054 --> 43:44.253
(group chatter)

43:44.255 --> 43:45.455
- He said he was
playing basketball.

43:45.457 --> 43:46.923
Hoops he said.

43:46.925 --> 43:48.725
But you know, I'm not
buying that for a second.

43:48.727 --> 43:50.393
Basketball?

43:50.395 --> 43:51.594
- What makes you say that?

43:51.596 --> 43:55.098
- Well he hasn't played
basketball for ages.

43:55.100 --> 43:57.000
And the YMCA?

43:57.002 --> 43:59.969
Like I'm not even sure that he
still has a YMCA membership.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.170
- But why would he lie?

44:01.172 --> 44:03.239
I mean like who
lies about the YMCA?

44:03.241 --> 44:04.440
- Exactly.

44:04.442 --> 44:05.475
This is so--

44:06.444 --> 44:07.844
- [Woman] It's so.

44:07.846 --> 44:09.612
- [Woman In Stripes]
I don't know.

44:09.614 --> 44:10.847

No, why?

47:56.207 --> 47:57.974
That's fine.

47:57.976 --> 47:59.475
- Mike, we haven't seen you

47:59.477 --> 48:01.377
for two fucking hours.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.981
I have been doing
all of your shit.

48:04.983 --> 48:05.982
Counting drops,

48:05.984 --> 48:06.983
cutting people,

48:06.985 --> 48:08.217
checking the side work,

48:08.219 --> 48:09.819

you doing down here?

48:09.821 --> 48:11.254
- I'm sorry.

48:11.256 --> 48:12.321

48:13.391 --> 48:14.290

Everything's fine.

48:16.361 --> 48:17.560
But are you okay?

48:17.562 --> 48:18.561
- I'm good.

48:18.563 --> 48:19.462
I'm good.

48:23.501 --> 48:24.800

48:25.837 --> 48:26.903
- Yeah, you know I did.

48:26.905 --> 48:28.337
I got sick.

48:28.339 --> 48:29.772
I was.

48:29.774 --> 48:31.107
But it's over now.

48:31.109 --> 48:32.008
- Michael.

48:33.745 --> 48:36.512
What the hell is going on?

48:36.514 --> 48:37.747
- Can we talk?

48:39.083 --> 48:40.082
- Of course.

48:40.084 --> 48:40.983

Is everything okay out there?

49:33.237 --> 49:35.404
- Everything is fine.

49:35.406 --> 49:36.405

49:37.475 --> 49:38.574

49:38.576 --> 49:39.575
- Everyone but Jake.

49:39.577 --> 49:41.444
He's just closed up.

49:41.446 --> 49:42.645
But you need to lock up.

49:42.647 --> 49:43.646
You do know that, right?

49:43.648 --> 49:44.647

56:20.411 --> 56:21.310

experienced,

56:31.655 --> 56:32.755

56:38.028 --> 56:39.428
you know,

56:39.430 --> 56:41.830
this wasn't something
new for you.

- Well it was.

56:45.236 --> 56:46.802
- You and me both.

- So.

56:57.848 --> 56:59.682
- So.

56:59.683 --> 57:01.517
- So do you have any
questions for me?

57:01.519 --> 57:02.451
- Questions?

57:02.453 --> 57:03.352
No.

57:05.423 --> 57:06.422

57:08.259 --> 57:10.259
I just hope we're cool.

57:13.197 --> 57:14.096

57:20.638 --> 57:21.537

I'm sorry, I don't
want to keep you.

57:30.481 --> 57:32.080
I just wanted to talk.

57:32.082 --> 57:33.715
- No.

57:33.717 --> 57:35.117
No, I'm late.

57:35.119 --> 57:36.385
- Okay, that's fine.

57:36.387 --> 57:38.253
I'll just, take care
of yourself I guess.

57:38.255 --> 57:39.154
- Mike.

57:40.991 --> 57:41.890
I'm late.

57:43.227 --> 57:46.328
(soft music)

57:46.330 --> 57:47.796

57:47.798 --> 57:48.997
- Yeah.

57:48.999 --> 57:51.500
(soft music)

57:54.638 --> 57:58.540
- Okay, so
how do we,

58:00.744 --> 58:04.313
how do you want to
proceed?

58:06.517 --> 58:07.816
- I don't know.

58:08.819 --> 58:09.918
- How can I help?

58:09.920 --> 58:12.688
- I don't know, I don't know.

58:12.690 --> 58:15.424
Okay, this is new to me.

58:15.426 --> 58:17.693
Kind of new waters, you know.

58:17.695 --> 58:19.661
- Of course, of course.

58:24.635 --> 58:26.034
- Well have you,

58:28.205 --> 58:29.104
have you

58:30.107 --> 58:31.006
considered

58:32.343 --> 58:34.510
what are you considering?

58:35.379 --> 58:36.879
- I have no clue.

58:40.651 --> 58:42.017
This is not what I had in mind,

58:42.019 --> 58:44.186
not what I had in
mind that night,

58:44.188 --> 58:46.154
not what I had in mind
for my life for right now.

58:46.156 --> 58:49.992
Okay, this was not a part
of the plan, you know.

58:49.994 --> 58:51.627
- I understand.

58:51.629 --> 58:54.463
(soft music)

58:54.465 --> 58:57.332
- I mean I can't have a kid.

58:57.334 --> 58:58.233
Right now?

58:59.470 --> 59:03.138
Are you fucking kidding me?

59:03.140 --> 59:04.039
No way.

59:06.577 --> 59:10.078
But I can't tell
my parents either.

59:10.080 --> 59:11.713
They'd pitch a fit.

59:17.154 --> 59:19.388
This is just so fucked up.

59:20.858 --> 59:22.357
This was not supposed
to happen to me,

59:22.359 --> 59:23.592
not like this.

59:27.598 --> 59:29.731
- Have you looked into a,

59:30.601 --> 59:31.667
a procedure?

59:34.705 --> 59:36.204
- I need to get my
parent's permission

59:36.206 --> 59:38.173
in order to get an abortion.

59:38.175 --> 59:39.875
Unless I want to go see a judge.

59:39.877 --> 59:42.277
And that's not gonna happen.

59:43.514 --> 59:44.846
- Well what about me?

59:44.848 --> 59:46.381
Can I help?

59:46.383 --> 59:48.016
- You?

59:48.018 --> 59:50.185
Help, seriously?

59:50.187 --> 59:51.887
You're my fucking
statutory rapist,

59:51.889 --> 59:54.089
what the hell can you do?

59:55.192 --> 59:57.059
You've done quite
enough already,

59:57.061 --> 59:58.460
don't you think.

01:00:01.198 --> 01:00:02.097
- Right.

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:04.032
Right.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:08.170
- I'm sorry.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.439
Okay, I'm just,

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:13.709
I'm just kind of freaking
out over here, you know.

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:14.776
- Oh I know.

01:00:15.546 --> 01:00:17.045
Trust me, I know.

01:00:20.718 --> 01:00:22.217
- Look, I got to go.

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:23.986
- So Maria--

01:00:23.988 --> 01:00:25.053
- Yes, Mike?

01:00:29.226 --> 01:00:32.628
- This is all pretty
delicate, you know.

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:35.163
I mean--

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:37.966
- I get it.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:41.603
- I mean I want to be
there for you, but--

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:43.071
- I know.

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:44.673
- [Mike] This.

01:00:44.675 --> 01:00:45.907
- It's okay.

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:46.742
You just can't right now.

01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:48.310
I get it.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:50.746
(soft music)

01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:51.780
- [Mike] Do you have someone,

01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:53.582
do you have someone to help you?

01:00:53.584 --> 01:00:55.017
- I'm a big girl.

01:00:55.919 --> 01:00:57.853
I'll be fine on my own.

01:01:00.591 --> 01:01:01.423
And Mike,

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:04.159
you,

01:01:05.596 --> 01:01:06.495
you were

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:08.997
good

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.833
as Captain Black.

01:01:13.704 --> 01:01:14.936
See ya.

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:18.740
(soft music)

01:01:20.944 --> 01:01:23.545
(kids playing)

01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:30.352
- Oh my god.

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:46.702
Lord help me.

01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:56.344
- [Woman] Hello?

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:57.212
- Hi.

01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:06.755
(doorbell rings)

01:02:17.534 --> 01:02:18.366
Hi.

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:19.568
- [Woman] Hi.

01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:22.738
Well come in.

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:25.240
- Thanks.

01:02:38.021 --> 01:02:40.722
- Can I get you some
water or something?

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:41.723
- No, thanks.

01:02:41.725 --> 01:02:42.624
I'm fine

01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:46.962
- Oh, sit down I guess.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:53.435
- [Kid] Give it to me.

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:54.936
- [Kid] No mine.

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:56.471
(screams)

01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:58.273
- Just give me a minute.

01:02:58.275 --> 01:02:59.708
- [Kid] Mine, give it to me.

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:00.742
- [Kid] Mine.

01:03:00.744 --> 01:03:02.277
Mine, give it to me.

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:05.213
- [Woman] Hey, no, no, don't.

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:06.915
Uncle Mike is here

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:08.383
and I need to talk to him

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:10.085
in private for a minute.

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:11.786
So just give me a second, okay.
I'll be back.

01:03:32.743 --> 01:03:35.110
- The place looks great.

01:03:35.112 --> 01:03:36.011
- Thanks.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:40.248
- How are the kids?

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.483
- [Brie] Mike.

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:49.624
- You know, this year
would have been their

01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:52.260
50th wedding anniversary.

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:53.995
- I'm aware of that.

01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:00.302
- Do you remember,

01:04:00.304 --> 01:04:03.138
remember a long time ago,

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.539
I told you that,

01:04:05.642 --> 01:04:08.844
that we should see
each other more often.

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:12.714
I was afraid that

01:04:12.716 --> 01:04:13.682
when we did

01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:17.752
that it would be bad.

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:20.956
It would be because
of something bad.

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:22.057
Do you remember that?

01:04:22.059 --> 01:04:23.625
- I remember that.

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:28.864
- This might be bad.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:36.838
- Okay.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.907
- I might be in trouble.

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:41.042
- Okay.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:44.212
- I met a girl, and

01:04:46.316 --> 01:04:48.884
I think she might be pregnant.

01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:50.752
- Okay.

01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:53.555
- The thing is,

01:04:55.092 --> 01:04:56.524
when we met,

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:57.559
she didn't,

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:03.164
I never asked her

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:06.902
how old she was.

01:05:09.439 --> 01:05:11.039
- What?

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.674
- And I--

01:05:12.676 --> 01:05:15.176
- Oh my god, what
the fuck, Mike?

01:05:15.178 --> 01:05:18.546
- [Mike] I thought about what happened to you.
- What the fuck are you saying?

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:19.447
- That I felt awful.

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:21.049
- [Brie] You felt awful?

01:05:21.051 --> 01:05:22.367
- I did.

01:05:22.368 --> 01:05:23.684
I felt awful.
Of course I felt awful.

01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:25.754
- How can you come in my house with
this and you tell me to feel bad?

01:05:25.756 --> 01:05:26.454
- I'm sorry.

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:27.856
- [Brie] You tell me this.

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.257
- I didn't know what to do.
- You abandoned me, Mike.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:30.525
You just left me.

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:32.394
I was horrified
and I felt alone,

01:05:32.396 --> 01:05:33.862
and you just left me.

01:05:33.864 --> 01:05:34.863
- I didn't know.

01:05:34.865 --> 01:05:35.864
I didn't know what to do.

01:05:35.866 --> 01:05:36.898
- Fuck you.

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:37.916
Get out of my house.

01:05:37.917 --> 01:05:38.933
- No, I'm not gonna
get out of your house.

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:40.202
I want to talk to you.

01:05:40.203 --> 01:05:41.469
- No, I'm not talking to you.
Get out of my house.

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:42.470
You cannot talk to me.

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:43.405
I am not here for you.

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:45.407
Get out of my house right now.

01:05:45.409 --> 01:05:46.408
- No.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:47.242
I'm not, I'm not leaving.

01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:48.076
I'm standing right here.

01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:49.144
- No, go.

01:05:49.146 --> 01:05:50.278
- I'm right here.
- Go.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.613
- I'm right here.
- Get out.

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:52.981
Get out.

01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:53.882
- Fine.

01:05:53.884 --> 01:05:54.783
- Out.

01:05:55.652 --> 01:05:56.651
- Fine.

01:05:56.653 --> 01:05:57.886
- Out of my house.

01:05:57.888 --> 01:05:58.954
- I'm going.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.624
(soft music)

01:06:19.776 --> 01:06:20.809
(knocking on door)

01:06:20.811 --> 01:06:22.210
- Yeah, come in.

01:06:24.348 --> 01:06:27.349
- We're not gonna do this again.

01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:28.249
Holy shit.

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:30.785
- You're telling me.

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:32.821
- She did not that young.

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:33.822
- Nope.

01:06:33.824 --> 01:06:35.490
She did not.

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:36.825
- And now it's like,

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:38.927
what can you do?

01:06:38.929 --> 01:06:40.662
I mean this is--

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:42.230
- Don't I know it.

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:46.935
- And she says she has
to talk to her parents?

01:06:46.937 --> 01:06:48.136
Or a judge?

01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:49.604
- I don't want to
think about a judge.

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:51.973
- You tell anyone else?

01:06:51.975 --> 01:06:53.041
- My sister.

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:56.211
- You're kidding?

01:06:56.213 --> 01:06:57.112
- Nope.

01:06:58.115 --> 01:06:59.014
- Jesus.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:02.417
How'd that go?

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:05.153
Wow.

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:07.622
(soft music)

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.526
- The girl,

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.795
she called me a rapist.

01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:15.397
- What?

01:07:15.399 --> 01:07:16.398
- She--

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.465
- That's bullshit.

01:07:17.467 --> 01:07:18.833
Mike, I saw it.

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:20.301
- I know.

01:07:20.303 --> 01:07:21.302
- That fucking little bitch.

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:22.370
I mean I saw it.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:23.405
I saw it Mike.

01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:24.672
I didn't see it, but--

01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:26.374
- That's not what I mean.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.075
- She was coming on to you all night long.
- That's not what I mean.

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:30.412
- Well what the
fuck do you mean?

01:07:31.982 --> 01:07:32.881
- I mean

01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:36.384
that's not what she meant.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:38.553
I mean she

01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:40.822
understands

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:43.725
the sensitivity of

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:46.561
the situation.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:47.662
She gets it.

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:49.397
- Oh, she gets it?

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.432
- Right.

01:07:50.434 --> 01:07:51.366
- Great.

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:53.001
She gets it.

01:07:53.003 --> 01:07:56.471
Fat fucking lot of
good that does for us.

01:07:57.274 --> 01:07:59.574
Mike, I am here for you.

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:00.775
- I know.

01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:03.178
- I just don't
know what I can do.

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.079
- I know.

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:07.082
- I don't know if there's
anything I can do, you know.

01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:08.349
- I know.

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:09.184
I know.

01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:13.688
- It's like we're fucked.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.557
- It's like I'm fucked.

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:18.460
- Yeah. You're right,
I didn't want to say anything.

01:08:21.031 --> 01:08:22.796
It's like you're fucked.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.099
Yeah.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:29.203
It's your own fault.

01:08:29.206 --> 01:08:31.305
You looked pretty
hot in that outfit.

01:08:31.308 --> 01:08:33.608
(laughter)

01:08:45.255 --> 01:08:47.122
You're a good man.

01:08:47.124 --> 01:08:49.124
Don't forget that.

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:50.390
- Thanks.

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:54.462
- Don't do that, I am
telling you something.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:55.363
You

01:08:55.732 --> 01:08:57.031
are a good man.

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:03.904

(soft music)

01:10:27.023 --> 01:10:27.922
- Well,

01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:35.730
I'm not sure how to

01:10:37.601 --> 01:10:39.267
tell you guys this.

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:44.739
The thing is,

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:52.981
well I haven't really wrapped
my brain around it yet.

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:56.417
The thing is,

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:05.960
oh I wish you guys
were here right now.

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:10.898
Or maybe I don't.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:11.799
Maybe,

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:18.940
maybe it's better that you're
not here because I don't,

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:22.010
I don't know,

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:26.514
(soft music)

01:11:29.219 --> 01:11:30.118
I don't,

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:37.558
I miss you guys so much.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.194
I wish you were here right now.

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:50.738
It really is so beautiful here.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:53.241
(soft music)

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:35.950
See you soon.

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:03.411
(soft music)

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:22.630
Holy shit.

01:13:26.536 --> 01:13:27.435
Holy shit.

01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:32.273
(car alarm honking)

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:36.577
(dog barking)

01:13:55.465 --> 01:13:56.531
- [Kris] Hey there, it's Kris.

01:13:56.533 --> 01:13:57.899
I can't take your call.

01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:59.066
Let me know what's what.

01:13:59.068 --> 01:13:59.967
Chow.

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:03.004
- Hey, Kris.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:05.840
It's me.

01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:10.111
It's Mike.

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.248
So that thing, the thing

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:16.050
that we talked about.

01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:20.988
I think it's bad.

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:22.156
I don't know,

01:14:24.394 --> 01:14:27.829
I don't know what's
gonna go down.

01:14:27.831 --> 01:14:30.097
But I think I might
be in trouble.

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:30.998
Listen,

01:14:32.402 --> 01:14:35.403
you're the only one
with a key to my place.

01:14:35.405 --> 01:14:36.304
So if

01:14:41.778 --> 01:14:42.810
anything happens to me,

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:44.745
or anything goes down,

01:14:44.747 --> 01:14:45.746
hopefully everything's fine

01:14:45.748 --> 01:14:47.348
and I'm just making a big

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:49.784
fucking fool out of myself.

01:14:49.786 --> 01:14:51.586
Could you just make
sure nothing happens

01:14:51.588 --> 01:14:52.920
to Gatito cause

01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:56.991
you're great.

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:59.260
And I love you, thank you.

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:01.762
(soft music)

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:07.802
Fucking no idea.

01:15:07.804 --> 01:15:09.504
I had no idea.

01:15:09.506 --> 01:15:12.006
(soft music)

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:24.085
(fighting next door)

01:15:35.331 --> 01:15:36.464
- [Andre] Oh go.

01:15:36.466 --> 01:15:37.465
You want me to go?

01:15:37.467 --> 01:15:38.699
Where do you want me to go, huh?

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:39.901
And what are you gonna
do without me, huh?

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:41.469
What are you gonna
do without me?

01:15:41.471 --> 01:15:42.803
What are you gonna do then?

01:15:42.805 --> 01:15:44.805
- [Tracey] Please just go.

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:48.576
(dramatic music)

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:17.738
- Who the hell's that?

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.575
(dramatic music)

01:16:21.177 --> 01:16:22.510
What the fuck?

01:16:22.512 --> 01:16:23.578
No.

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:30.084
- Mike.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:32.954
- [Mike] Son of a bitch.

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:34.255
- Jesus Mike, stop.

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:35.590
- Son of a bitch.

01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:36.857
How dare you.

01:16:36.859 --> 01:16:38.025
How dare you hit a woman.

01:16:38.027 --> 01:16:39.226
Never again.

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:42.096
(dramatic music)

01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:45.933
Get the fuck out of here

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.034
and never come back.

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:48.035
You understand me,

01:16:48.037 --> 01:16:49.537
never the fuck come back.

01:16:49.539 --> 01:16:50.471
- Baby.

01:16:50.473 --> 01:16:51.973
- You heard him, get out.

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:53.474
Get the fuck out of my life.
- [Andre] Baby, I'm sorry.

01:16:53.476 --> 01:16:54.875
- Get out.
- Leave him alone. Baby.

01:16:54.877 --> 01:16:56.944
- You heard her.
Go.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:57.845
- Go.

01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:05.653
It's okay, Austin,
we'll be okay.

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:22.970
- And you.

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:26.874
Life is too precious.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:29.877
Life is too fragile.

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:34.749
Be your own goddamn ally.

01:17:34.751 --> 01:17:35.650
- Okay.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:41.989
