on The Strain...

00:04.673 --> 00:06.975
- Every contact
with the outside world

00:07.008 --> 00:09.310
has been severed.
There's no way they're getting

00:09.343 --> 00:11.946
that warhead into the city.
- Zack, help!

00:11.980 --> 00:15.483
Come on! Zack! No!

00:15.516 --> 00:19.087
- You gave Abbey a gift. She's
part of the Master's family now.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.023
And she will never
betray you again.

00:22.056 --> 00:25.393
- A230385.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.998
(crack)

00:30.031 --> 00:33.501
- Your companion's blood
smells like yours.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.503
- No!

00:35.536 --> 00:37.338
- And now, this one, too.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.841
(crack)
- No!

00:39.874 --> 00:43.044
- Augustin.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.746
Now, you.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.449
(squish)

00:48.482 --> 00:49.851
(grunting)

00:49.884 --> 00:52.721
(groaning)

00:52.754 --> 00:55.056
- Finish this.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.531
(groaning)

01:05.734 --> 01:07.068
My name

01:07.101 --> 01:10.071
is Abraham Setrakian.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.339
(speaking foreign language)

01:29.390 --> 01:32.193
- The professor would want us to
wake him to give him the White.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.128
God. I just hope that it...

01:41.803 --> 01:45.706
- (Ephraim): A strigoi
in a perfectly tailored suit...

01:45.740 --> 01:49.077
who just happens
to be missing a hand.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.846
- We need to be sure.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.915
Look for the head.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.627
- Dutch.

02:17.939 --> 02:21.142
- Serves him right.
- Looks like he was poisoned.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.177
- We need to find the professor.

02:26.014 --> 02:29.450
- Hey... it's just me.

02:29.483 --> 02:33.121
- Gus, what the hell happened?

02:33.154 --> 02:35.957
Where's Setrakian and Alex?

02:35.990 --> 02:37.758
- Alex didn't make it.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.364
- And the old man?

02:45.166 --> 02:47.001
Is he okay?

02:58.179 --> 03:00.982
(hard exhale)

03:01.015 --> 03:02.350
- Professor?

03:02.383 --> 03:05.219
(sniffing, exhaling)

03:14.896 --> 03:18.466
- Hey... are you all right?

03:18.499 --> 03:20.501
Setrakian...

03:27.075 --> 03:28.843
- I...

03:28.877 --> 03:31.212
don't have much time.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.447
- How long ago

03:33.481 --> 03:35.850
were you infected?
What are your symptoms?

03:35.884 --> 03:38.686
If we can get all the facts, then maybe
we can figure out a way to slow down...

03:38.719 --> 03:41.923
- You cannot help me, Doctor.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.227
I still have work to do.

03:55.937 --> 03:57.939
♪♪♪

04:55.496 --> 04:58.132
MAN (on P.A.): This is
the Partnership River Patrol.

04:58.166 --> 05:00.301
No one is allowed
to cross the river.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.303
Pull the boat into the dock.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.077
- How goes it, fellas?

05:09.110 --> 05:11.745
Cold one, huh?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.581
- No one's allowed
to be out here.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.951
- Okay. Uh, you know,
no one told me that.

05:16.985 --> 05:19.520
- Armband.
- Yeah.

05:23.024 --> 05:26.094
- All right. Search it.

05:26.127 --> 05:28.963
O'Malley? What the hell's
going on up there?

05:28.997 --> 05:31.765
Hey. Stay where you are.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.202
(cracking and groaning)
What the hell?

05:37.505 --> 05:38.973
(crack)
- Aah!

05:48.682 --> 05:51.619
- Nice work. Both of you.

05:55.689 --> 05:59.327
It's good to be home.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.663
- Yeah, now what? Quinlan
gonna carry the bomb

06:02.696 --> 06:05.633
wherever your friends are?

06:05.666 --> 06:08.869
- He doesn't have to.

06:08.902 --> 06:12.873
Anyway, it's my turn to drive.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.182
Jesus.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.684
Where the hell
is everybody?

06:23.717 --> 06:26.554
- Maybe they've
been sequestered.

06:30.991 --> 06:34.195
Rome was like
this for a time.

06:34.228 --> 06:37.065
Back in the
14th century.

06:37.098 --> 06:39.067
- What? The plague?

06:46.574 --> 06:49.043
- Wall Street?

06:49.077 --> 06:51.712
Where are you taking us, man?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.448
- The safest place to park
the nuke that I can think of.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.919
- (Roman): The government
kept a shit-ton of gold

06:58.952 --> 07:00.854
in this place, right?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.723
Think it's still in here?
- Doesn't matter,

07:02.756 --> 07:05.259
gold is worthless now.
- Yeah, but the building's

07:05.293 --> 07:07.295
still set up
to protect it.

07:09.597 --> 07:12.066
- You really think
the nuke's gonna be safe

07:12.100 --> 07:14.335
just, like, sitting here
while we go find your friends?

07:14.368 --> 07:16.670
I mean, what if the Partnership
comes poking around?

07:16.704 --> 07:18.572
- That's an excellent
point, Roman.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.774
Here,

07:20.808 --> 07:23.077
keep it set to channel two.

07:23.111 --> 07:25.379
(clicks tongue)
- Whoa.

07:25.413 --> 07:27.581
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no. Uh-uh.

07:27.615 --> 07:30.050
No, this is not a good idea.
- Have you so little faith

07:30.084 --> 07:32.786
in your own abilities?
- No,

07:32.820 --> 07:35.789
I just feel like y'all are
gonna leave me down here to die.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.626
- Only if you die
of boredom, Roman.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.929
We'll send word
as soon as we can.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.298
Hey.

07:44.332 --> 07:46.300
Don't worry so much.

07:46.334 --> 07:48.936
All right?

07:50.404 --> 07:52.606
- You can't just
shut us out like this.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.608
You have to
let us help you.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.145
There must be
something that we can do.

07:57.178 --> 08:00.448
What about the White?
- Yes.

08:00.481 --> 08:03.817
If it can slow down
the aging process,

08:03.851 --> 08:05.753
then maybe it has a similar
effect on the replication

08:05.786 --> 08:08.456
of worms.
- The White is useless

08:08.489 --> 08:11.859
against the parasite itself.
There is nothing to be done.

08:15.363 --> 08:18.666
- When we find the old man

08:18.699 --> 08:21.335
and tell him we got
the nuke, you think he might

08:21.369 --> 08:24.805
finally give me a smile?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.175
Yeah, just like that one.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.146
- You have visitors.

08:32.180 --> 08:34.182
- Hey.

08:40.188 --> 08:43.191
- What's going on?

08:44.825 --> 08:47.761
Hey, Professor.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.530
Sorry, it took so long, but, um,

08:49.563 --> 08:52.233
we finally got
you your, uh...

08:54.735 --> 08:56.904
Oh, this can't be happening.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.242
- Professor, relax,
relax. Take a seat.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.150
- I have...

09:10.184 --> 09:13.687
tried to write down all I could,

09:13.721 --> 09:16.123
but... I...

09:16.156 --> 09:18.559
I have no time left.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.395
Now, you must listen.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.033
All this time...
I had been...

09:26.066 --> 09:28.836
looking at the Lumen
through the... prism

09:28.869 --> 09:32.240
of what I wanted to find there;

09:32.273 --> 09:36.143
a concrete way
of killing the Master,

09:36.176 --> 09:38.412
but...

09:38.446 --> 09:40.581
I was wrong.

09:40.614 --> 09:44.084
I have gone
back in, and...

09:44.117 --> 09:46.186
I understand now

09:46.220 --> 09:48.756
what we have to do.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.191
We have to separate...

09:51.225 --> 09:53.427
the Master from all

09:53.461 --> 09:55.596
his collaborators.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.703
The-the Lumen says...

10:02.736 --> 10:04.572
"The power of the Beast

10:04.605 --> 10:08.542
"resides not within itself...

10:08.576 --> 10:11.445
"but within its limbs,

10:11.479 --> 10:14.081
"those who willfully...

10:14.114 --> 10:15.616
"do its bidding

10:15.649 --> 10:17.718

10:20.954 --> 10:23.291
Acting out of

10:23.324 --> 10:26.594
deluded self-interest.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.796
Once we cut them away,

10:28.829 --> 10:30.931
he will be weakened.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.467
We will then be able to strike,

10:33.501 --> 10:36.604
but this last move
will come at a cost.

10:36.637 --> 10:40.308
It will require an act of...

10:40.341 --> 10:43.010
...self-sacrifice.

10:44.345 --> 10:47.114
- Professor...

10:47.147 --> 10:48.949
what about the nuke?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.419
- Please...

10:51.452 --> 10:54.455
do not let
the work I've done...

10:54.488 --> 10:57.157
be in vain.

10:58.359 --> 11:00.961
Promise me.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.297

11:03.331 --> 11:06.300

13:41.655 --> 13:44.692
for more than 2,000 years.

13:46.694 --> 13:49.630
I know that a single human life

13:49.663 --> 13:52.600
is too often just
a flicker in the darkness.

13:55.536 --> 13:58.939
We should not mourn this man.

13:58.972 --> 14:02.476
His death was
inevitable. Instead,

14:02.510 --> 14:05.012
we should remember what
it is that he showed us.

14:07.715 --> 14:09.683
That the real...

14:09.717 --> 14:13.521

14:18.859 --> 14:20.561
no matter the cost.

14:24.832 --> 14:27.501
His life was a beacon.

- You know, I told him
this was poison.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.546
I never thought
he would take...

15:12.580 --> 15:14.081
- He wasn't gonna let them win.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.750
Not while he had
any fight left in him.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.923

15:22.956 --> 15:25.392
Were you there

I saw my cousin die, though.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.904
Eichorst wanted me to see it.

- I'm sorry.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.910
- I'm just sayin'
it's probably better

15:42.943 --> 15:45.613
that you didn't see
what happened to her.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.751
At least you got to say
good-bye to the old man.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.787
- You know...

15:53.821 --> 15:56.123
when my father died

15:56.156 --> 15:58.959
I was in India,
I was working.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.629
He had a sudden
heart attack

16:01.662 --> 16:05.398
at a pancake breakfast
at the Rotary Club.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.635

16:07.668 --> 16:10.470
if I could
have seen him...

16:10.503 --> 16:13.373
one last time,
just talked to him...

16:13.406 --> 16:16.777
it'd be easier, somehow.
Not easier, different.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.980
I'd be more settled.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.315
But I've seen

16:22.349 --> 16:25.285
a lot of people
I love die

16:25.318 --> 16:29.256
and I don't feel
settled. I feel...

16:29.289 --> 16:32.492
- Like you wish
you had 'em all back.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.451
(sighs)

16:58.485 --> 17:02.055

when I was out there.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.294
The Professor, he had the Lumen.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.831
He was burning the pages.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.701
Then I saw he was infected.

17:15.803 --> 17:18.706
I mean, that's weird, right?

17:18.739 --> 17:21.842
How it all...

17:21.875 --> 17:24.211
basically came true?

17:24.244 --> 17:27.314
- I don't know.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.283
Maybe.

17:30.317 --> 17:33.020
Or maybe you were
just... dreaming

17:33.053 --> 17:35.989
about what you were
most afraid of.

17:36.023 --> 17:38.025
- Yeah.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.213
- What do you think?

18:00.247 --> 18:03.016
- (sighs): I think

18:03.050 --> 18:04.918
I just spent nine months

18:04.952 --> 18:07.287
getting a nuke for
the old man and, uh...

18:09.456 --> 18:11.591
...I-I don't
see anything. I mean,

18:11.624 --> 18:14.094
where's the face of God
in all of this?

18:14.127 --> 18:17.097
- Setrakian told me he was
wrong about the face of God.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.266
- Wrong how?

18:19.299 --> 18:21.401
- I'm not
really sure.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.403
- He was caught up
in this new idea:

18:23.436 --> 18:26.239
cutting off the Master from his
collaborators. You heard him.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.776
- Yes, we did. And
with all due respect,

18:28.809 --> 18:30.878
he may not have been
in his right mind at the time.

18:30.911 --> 18:33.914
It's possible that the voice
we heard was not Setrakian's

18:33.947 --> 18:37.084
at all but the Master trying to lead
us astray. - I don't believe that.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.952
- Well, that's fine, 'cause
it's not about what we believe,

18:38.986 --> 18:41.088
it's about what we know,
and we know that a bomb

18:41.121 --> 18:43.123
wiped out the Ancients.
- No, we don't know that.

18:43.156 --> 18:46.126
We presume that. What we know
is that his last bomb

18:46.159 --> 18:49.229
killed thousands of people,
and it triggered a nuclear war

18:49.262 --> 18:50.964
that killed millions
of people, and plunged us

18:50.998 --> 18:52.966
into nuclear winter.
So, I'm a little wary

18:53.000 --> 18:56.436
of setting off another one.
- We need to gather

18:56.469 --> 18:58.939
all of our weapons
as soon as possible.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.574
- Why? We got a big
sale coming up?

19:01.608 --> 19:04.778
- Nah. No more selling.
We're done with all that.

19:04.812 --> 19:07.114
We're putting everything we got
into the fight with the strigoi

19:07.147 --> 19:09.817
and the Master. And that

19:09.850 --> 19:11.751
includes all of us.

19:11.785 --> 19:14.487
- Do you think you can
tell me what to do?

19:14.521 --> 19:17.457
- (some): Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.293
- Calma, calmate.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.933
- Where is Creem?
- He tried to make a deal

19:25.966 --> 19:28.068
with the strigoi
and it didn't go so well.

19:28.101 --> 19:31.471
Last I saw him, he was
trying to drink my blood,

19:31.504 --> 19:34.641
so I drove a dagger
into his big-ass mouth.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.845
Now, that's what
I'm trying to tell you,

19:37.878 --> 19:41.314
we can't think that this
doesn't involve us anymore.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.917
Every deal you make,

19:43.951 --> 19:47.154
every decision
you think you're making,

19:47.187 --> 19:50.690
the Master has a hand in it.

19:50.723 --> 19:54.627
And if we don't fight,
we're helping him win.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.630
- Now, if you think
you're tougher than Creem,

19:57.664 --> 20:00.633
you can go.
Do what you gotta do.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.871
I'm not gonna stop you.

20:03.904 --> 20:06.506
- All right, so what
do we do know? We know that...

20:06.539 --> 20:09.977
sunlight won't kill him, cutting
off his head doesn't work.

20:10.010 --> 20:11.845
Neither does putting him
in a box, so...

20:11.879 --> 20:14.882
- It's astonishing to me
that we're still debating this.

20:14.915 --> 20:17.517
The Master is clearly afraid
of us attacking him with a nuke.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.187
He just blew every bridge
and tunnel onto Manhattan

20:20.220 --> 20:22.355
to try and keep us from bringing
one anywhere near him.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.524
- Well, that may be true,
but I still agree with Eph.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.061
Vaporizing a city full of people
is not the way to save humanity.

20:28.095 --> 20:31.198
- Most of those people are
working with The Partnership.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.533
If you're so keen on doing what
Setrakian said-- cutting off

20:33.566 --> 20:35.568
the Master's collaborators--
then I think setting off

20:35.602 --> 20:37.804
a nuclear bomb is an
excellent way of doing that.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.908
- He did say that killing
the Master would come at a cost.

20:40.941 --> 20:44.211
- Yeah, some sort of self-
sacrifice, not mass annihilation.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.915
- All right.
What's your idea, Doc? Huh?

20:47.948 --> 20:50.417
Come on, dazzle us.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.353
You got nothing, huh?

20:53.386 --> 20:55.722
But you want me

20:55.755 --> 20:57.925
to toss out the nuke just
because you're telling me to?

20:57.958 --> 20:59.927
- You made the promise
to Setrakian. Does that not

20:59.960 --> 21:03.063
mean anything to you?
- This is a waste of time.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.432
- Where are you going?
- To get the bomb.

21:05.465 --> 21:09.236
- Hey, hey, hang on.
What are you gonna do?

21:09.269 --> 21:12.272
You're just gonna go
get it and set it off?

21:12.305 --> 21:14.574
We don't know where
the Master is yet.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.277
- How do you propose we find
him? Shall we hand out flyers?

21:17.310 --> 21:20.280
We know the Master is somewhere
on the island. If we set

21:20.313 --> 21:22.950
the bomb to the highest
possible yield, the odds

21:22.983 --> 21:25.752
of killing him are good.
- Have you not heard

21:25.785 --> 21:28.255
a word that we've said?
- Yes. And not one of them has

21:28.288 --> 21:31.291
convinced me in the slightest.
- You're not setting off that nuke.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.927
- You really think you're gonna
stop me, Doctor? - All right, boys.

21:33.961 --> 21:37.597
I think I have a way
to find the Master. - How?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.432
- Sanjay Desai.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.302
He works at the Partnership
medical facility where Setrakian

21:42.335 --> 21:45.272
and I were being held.
He used to meet with Eichorst

21:45.305 --> 21:47.975
all the time. He's at the top of
the Master's pile of human shit.

21:48.008 --> 21:50.577
If we grab him, we can
bring him back here,

21:50.610 --> 21:53.080
and make him tell us
where the Master is.

21:53.113 --> 21:55.782
- And we'd be taking
a collaborator from him.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.118
That's what the old man
wanted us to do.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.620
- Regardless of what we
wind up doing with the nuke.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.889
- Not only that.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.992
We can get everyone
out of that horrible place.

22:36.056 --> 22:38.191
(heavy breathing)

22:46.899 --> 22:49.536
- Our enemies
are closing in.

22:49.569 --> 22:52.839
They have managed to bring an
atomic bomb onto this island.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.842
You know the devastation
such a weapon can cause?

22:55.875 --> 22:59.046
Yes,

22:59.079 --> 23:01.681
of course you do.

23:01.714 --> 23:05.352
Now, everything we have
achieved is at risk.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.854
The peace we
have established

23:07.887 --> 23:09.622
is being eroded.

23:09.656 --> 23:11.358
They will not stop

23:11.391 --> 23:14.227
until they have
incinerated us all.

23:14.261 --> 23:16.729
- There must be
something we can do.

23:16.763 --> 23:19.866
- There is something.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.902
It's rather delicate.

23:22.935 --> 23:26.239
A task only you
can perform.

23:26.273 --> 23:27.840
- Me?

23:27.874 --> 23:30.877
- Yes, my son.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.246
You are uniquely
suited for it.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.915
What happens next

23:35.948 --> 23:38.751
will determine
the fate of all of us.

23:42.021 --> 23:45.392
(low growling)

23:47.294 --> 23:50.530
- I have to go out for a while.

23:50.563 --> 23:53.266
- You have nothing

23:53.300 --> 23:55.368
to worry about, Zack.

23:55.402 --> 23:58.105
You were born to do this.

23:58.138 --> 24:00.707
That's why
the Master chose you.

24:08.115 --> 24:10.417
- Wow.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.419
You're so hot.

24:12.452 --> 24:15.288
I meant, like,

24:15.322 --> 24:17.457
you're warm. Your body.

24:28.401 --> 24:30.303
(growling continuing)

24:42.249 --> 24:43.850
(growls)

24:46.953 --> 24:48.655
(indistinct conversations)

24:54.127 --> 24:57.264
- That's new.

24:57.297 --> 25:01.201
- I lost my sword. And we
can't all be wearing them now.

25:04.204 --> 25:07.274
- You think you got a pretty good
idea of what we're going up against?

25:07.307 --> 25:09.942
- I only know what
it was like when I left.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.345
I'm sure they've amped up
the security since.

25:12.379 --> 25:15.014
We should be
ready for anything.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.817
- It makes me sick
that you were ever there.

25:17.850 --> 25:21.154
- Not half as sick
as it makes me.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.672
- So, tell me,

25:39.706 --> 25:43.643
what brought about your...
recommitment to the cause?

25:43.676 --> 25:47.380
- Something the Professor
said. Made me realize

25:47.414 --> 25:50.850
that no matter how hard you try,
you can't escape what you're

25:50.883 --> 25:53.320
right in the middle of.
- I'm sure he was pleased

25:53.353 --> 25:56.523
you came to your senses.
- Yeah, but not for long.

25:56.556 --> 25:58.858
They found him because of me.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.894
- And the fact that they'd
been hunting him for years.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.897
Don't dwell on it.

26:04.931 --> 26:07.900
There are far more
guilty people than you.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.537
- You have no idea
what I've done.

26:10.570 --> 26:13.740
- I don't need to. I'm sure
the list is long and tedious.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.808
One thing I do know:

26:15.842 --> 26:18.411
whipping your own back
won't make you stronger.

26:18.445 --> 26:20.447
It'll only distract you.

26:34.261 --> 26:36.363
I have a load of prisoners
who I am to take

26:36.396 --> 26:39.131
to the drainage
room immediately.

26:43.803 --> 26:46.439
Is there a problem?

26:46.473 --> 26:48.074
- It's just that
prisoners are usually

26:48.107 --> 26:49.576
taken to the loading dock.

26:49.609 --> 26:53.212
For sorting.
- I'm under special orders.

26:55.482 --> 26:57.917
- Uh, yes, sir.
Sorry. Come on in.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.821
(buzzing)

27:24.110 --> 27:26.078
(growling)

27:52.204 --> 27:54.807
- Everyone clear
on where they're going?

27:54.841 --> 27:56.943
Just remember, the longer
you can go without raising

27:56.976 --> 27:58.745
the alarms, the better
it is for everyone.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.713
- Radios?

28:17.464 --> 28:19.265
- (Fet): Kinda weird
that Mr. Bigshot collaborator

28:19.298 --> 28:21.534
still has his office next to

28:21.568 --> 28:23.670
a bunch of locked-up
pregnant women.

28:23.703 --> 28:27.039
- It's his pet project.
He likes to keep an eye

28:27.073 --> 28:29.041
on how all the women
are coming along.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.043
Make sure everything's
running on schedule.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.312
- Are you sure this mission
isn't all about revenge?

28:33.346 --> 28:35.782
- I'm never all
about one thing, Doc.

28:35.815 --> 28:39.218
- Oh, we know that.
- This is you.

28:41.721 --> 28:45.024
- Good luck, Doc.
- You too.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.027
- The boat was left
abandoned on Pier 16,

28:48.060 --> 28:50.363
along with the bodies of
four of our river patrolmen.

28:50.397 --> 28:51.864
- (sighs)

28:51.898 --> 28:53.065
And I'm gonna assume

28:53.099 --> 28:55.067
that this stolen
delivery boat,

28:55.101 --> 28:58.371
it, uh, was of a size
that could accommodate

28:58.405 --> 29:00.907
a nuclear warhead.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.223
(phone rings)
- What?

29:17.256 --> 29:19.225
- I hate to bother you, sir.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.428
I-I'm sure it's nothing, but
there was an unusual delivery

29:21.461 --> 29:23.095
at the south garage door.

29:23.129 --> 29:25.765
It was-it was a van
full of prisoners.

29:25.798 --> 29:28.535
Uh, the driver said that he was
heading straight for drainage.

29:28.568 --> 29:31.237
You knew about this, right?

29:31.270 --> 29:33.706
When the hell did this happen?

29:33.740 --> 29:35.808
- Uh, just a few minutes ago.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.812
(indistinct conversation
in distance)

29:51.624 --> 29:54.226
- Hey.

29:55.928 --> 29:59.131
- Yeah? What?

30:01.300 --> 30:04.437
Is there something you wanted?

30:04.471 --> 30:08.340
- It's nothing. Forget it.
Have a good one.

30:13.646 --> 30:16.148
- Look, I don't know who
this mystery van driver

30:16.182 --> 30:17.984
of yours is...

30:18.017 --> 30:20.687
but there is nobody at drainage.

30:26.358 --> 30:27.660
Shit.

30:27.694 --> 30:29.996
(alarm wailing in distance)

30:30.029 --> 30:33.232
Okay, I'm gonna
use really small words

30:33.265 --> 30:35.301
so you don't screw it up.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.770
Get this place
locked down. Tight.

30:43.810 --> 30:45.778
(alarm wailing)

30:54.521 --> 30:57.089
- Open all the doors.

30:57.123 --> 30:58.525
Please don't make me
kill somebody today.

30:58.558 --> 31:00.493
- I'm no traitor.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.061
- Fine.

31:15.241 --> 31:17.243
(beeping,
locks clicking in distance)

31:33.593 --> 31:35.361
- Is that...

31:35.394 --> 31:39.031
Jesus Christ.
They're in the building.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.900
They're right outside
this office. Murphy...

31:57.016 --> 31:58.250
- (grunts)

32:04.757 --> 32:07.760
(people screaming, crying)

32:12.464 --> 32:14.734
No! Let go of me!

32:14.767 --> 32:16.302
Wait! Wait!
- (growls)

32:19.806 --> 32:22.809
(shrieking)

32:28.948 --> 32:30.482
(grunting)

32:38.991 --> 32:41.293
(growling and groaning)

32:48.635 --> 32:49.969
(growling)

33:01.480 --> 33:03.883
- My man.

33:03.916 --> 33:06.052
All right, let's get
everybody out of the cages.

33:06.085 --> 33:08.788
- This way, here we go!
- Shh, shh. - Who are they?

33:08.821 --> 33:10.556
- Miranda?
- Where's Rosalinda?

33:10.589 --> 33:12.458
Did she make it out? - I don't
know, I haven't seen her.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.460
- I have no idea...
- Murphy,

33:14.493 --> 33:15.828
get them in the tanning
room. All three of you.

33:15.862 --> 33:18.264
Get in there. Now. Move it!
- Go, go, go.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.566
- Lock the door.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.835
You, get on the ground.

33:22.869 --> 33:24.871
(groaning)

33:29.809 --> 33:31.010
Murphy.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.845
Stay here.
We're safer here.

33:32.879 --> 33:34.513
The strigs'll come up
from drainage

33:34.546 --> 33:36.315
to help us. We just gotta
hold them off long enough

33:36.348 --> 33:39.518
until they get here.
Stay back, Dutch.

33:39.551 --> 33:42.221
Or all these young
mothers are dead.

33:43.856 --> 33:45.324
Hey!

33:45.357 --> 33:47.193
Not another step
there, handsome.

33:49.495 --> 33:52.699
- Fet, don't.
He'll do it.

33:59.739 --> 34:01.073
- So what's the plan here?

34:03.676 --> 34:06.879
There could be a busload of
strigoi on their way right now.

34:06.913 --> 34:09.615
The longer that we wait, the
harder it's gonna be to get...

34:09.648 --> 34:11.617
- Yeah, I get it.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.686
Go.

34:13.720 --> 34:16.789
Go.

34:16.823 --> 34:18.090
- Damn.

34:19.759 --> 34:23.062
(groaning)

34:23.095 --> 34:26.332
- You're not gonna listen
to me? Fine. Shoot her.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.236
Goddamn it, Murphy, shoot her!

34:32.604 --> 34:34.707
- Fine, I'll do it myself.

34:34.741 --> 34:36.909
- Don't! Please.

34:36.943 --> 34:38.244
(gunshot)

34:38.277 --> 34:41.180
- Goddamn it!
- Quick, here, here!

34:47.186 --> 34:49.121
(gunshot)
-Oh!

34:56.262 --> 34:58.264
(grunting, panting)

35:07.874 --> 35:09.441
Shit!

35:12.979 --> 35:15.081
- You'll be all right.
Come on, let's go.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.049
Come on, I got you.

35:17.083 --> 35:18.918
Come on, man, let's go.

35:18.951 --> 35:22.822
(deep growling)

35:26.458 --> 35:28.627
- Wait.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.676
(grunting)

35:59.525 --> 36:00.526
(growling)

36:14.373 --> 36:16.708
(snarling)

36:23.115 --> 36:24.150
(grunts)

36:32.291 --> 36:34.560
- Come on.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.372
Oh, shit.

36:59.919 --> 37:01.921
(clicking)

37:04.390 --> 37:08.060
- I got this.
We need him alive.

37:17.103 --> 37:19.906
- Ow!

37:19.939 --> 37:21.540
Shit.

37:29.081 --> 37:31.617
(grunting)

37:35.754 --> 37:37.723
(groaning)
God...

37:37.756 --> 37:39.258
damn it!
- Aah!

37:46.298 --> 37:48.700
Aah!

37:48.734 --> 37:50.903
- (grunting):
Goddamn it!

37:58.777 --> 38:00.579
(panting)

38:04.616 --> 38:07.286
- You know you're not
getting outta here, right?

38:07.319 --> 38:10.957
You're gonna end up like
your little buddy, Rosalinda,

38:10.990 --> 38:13.292
tossed in the incinerator.
(grunts)

38:17.096 --> 38:19.131
- You piece of shit.

38:22.068 --> 38:24.270
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

38:26.805 --> 38:29.308
- You really think he's gonna
talk when he wakes up?

38:29.341 --> 38:31.978
- He'll talk eventually.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.449
You okay?

38:37.483 --> 38:39.451
- Yeah.

38:39.485 --> 38:43.122
I'm just thinking about Alex.

38:43.155 --> 38:46.458
I probably wouldn't even
be here if it weren't for her.

38:46.492 --> 38:47.994
I'd probably
still be down in Philly,

38:48.027 --> 38:49.595
hiding out.

38:49.628 --> 38:53.499
Or worse:
I could be in a feedlot.

38:57.369 --> 39:00.306
- Hey, we bumped into
this kid out there.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.109
Said he was looking for you.

39:03.142 --> 39:05.677
- What kid? Where?

39:05.711 --> 39:09.448
- I dunno, man, some kid.
He was in the market on MLK.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.950
But don't worry.
We didn't tell him anything.

39:11.984 --> 39:15.487
- What did he look like?

39:15.521 --> 39:18.991
- White kid.
Uh, this... this tall.

39:19.025 --> 39:21.893
Skinny. Dark,
longish hair.

39:23.729 --> 39:26.298
- That describes
a lot of kids, Doc.

39:26.332 --> 39:29.701
- And even if,
by any chance, this is him,

39:29.735 --> 39:31.470
why would he be
looking for you now,

39:31.503 --> 39:33.505
after all this time
with the Master?

39:35.841 --> 39:38.677
- You mean the-the market
by the Harlem River?

39:38.710 --> 39:41.313
- Yeah.

39:45.017 --> 39:46.985
- Eph.
- I know, I know, you're both

39:47.019 --> 39:49.488
probably right.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.090
But I have to see for myself.
