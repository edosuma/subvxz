00:17.773 --> 00:21.193
<i>- Get</i> him!
<i>- Man, I'm tired of these pumpkinheads.</i>

00:24.655 --> 00:26.448
<i>Green Goblin makes a comeback...</i>

00:26.657 --> 00:28.492
<i>...and with other bosses
out of the picture...</i>

00:28.700 --> 00:31.328
<i>...he's become the Gob-father of crime.</i>

00:31.537 --> 00:35.749
<i>This is the fifth Gob Squad I've fought
and still no sign of their boss.</i>

00:42.297 --> 00:45.759
<i>Harry's still out there,
taking Globulin Green, blacking out...</i>

00:45.968 --> 00:49.221
...and <i>using downtime to Goblin up
and get</i> me <i>in his sights.</i>

00:49.429 --> 00:52.307
<i>I promised myself
I'd bring Harry home safely.</i>

00:56.228 --> 00:59.314
<i>But no one's seen him
since before the school play.</i>

01:03.652 --> 01:05.236
<i>No one but these creeps.</i>

01:13.579 --> 01:15.414
Attention all squash-brains.

01:15.622 --> 01:18.208
How about I swear
not to take that nickname literally...

01:18.417 --> 01:21.044
...in exchange
for you spilling (Bobby's address.

01:21.253 --> 01:22.713
- We don't know.
- He doesn't have a base.

01:22.921 --> 01:24.673
- He contacts us.
- We swear.

01:25.632 --> 01:27.009
Same old, same old.

01:32.598 --> 01:35.976
<i>Oh, come on, Harry. Where are you?</i>

01:48.530 --> 01:51.366
Gwen, I need your help.

02:55.180 --> 02:56.973
Hey, hey, Liz, it's Petey.

02:57.432 --> 03:01.019
Liz, I'm really sorry I didn't see the play,
but I had to take pic--

03:01.228 --> 03:04.481
I know, Peter. The <i>Bugle</i> comes first.

03:04.690 --> 03:07.818
But I can't help wondering
if it had been Gwen in the play--

03:08.026 --> 03:11.655
If Aunt May had been the fairy queen,
I'd still have missed the show.

03:11.863 --> 03:14.616
I was completely locked up with work.

03:16.576 --> 03:19.121
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

03:19.788 --> 03:22.624
Great. Bye.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.001
Aunt May? How long have you--?

03:25.210 --> 03:28.755
Long enough to know you need
to be honest with these girls, Peter.

03:28.964 --> 03:32.509
Which means that first,
you need to be honest with yourself.

03:34.261 --> 03:36.680
<i>- Gwen'?
- Peter, I need your help.</i>

03:38.807 --> 03:41.059
Gwen, are you all--? Harry.

03:41.768 --> 03:42.978
<i>Easy, Pete.</i>

03:43.186 --> 03:46.231
<i>Spidey knows Harry's the Goblin,
but Peter Parker doesn't.</i>

03:46.440 --> 03:49.735
<i>Even Harry may not know
he's the Goblin again. So play it cool.</i>

03:49.943 --> 03:50.986
<i>But be ready.</i>

03:51.194 --> 03:53.739
Harry, tell Pete what you told me.

03:54.740 --> 03:59.077
I guess the whole school knows
I juiced to improve my game.

03:59.286 --> 04:01.705
<i>What most don't know is that...</i>

04:01.913 --> 04:04.916
<i>...it was an experimental
OsCorp performance enhancer...</i>

04:05.125 --> 04:07.669
<i>...called Globulin Green.</i>

04:08.170 --> 04:11.631
<i>Or that I started blacking out
because of it.</i>

04:12.090 --> 04:17.928
<i>Or that during my blackouts,
I became the Green Goblin.</i>

04:19.555 --> 04:23.727
I mean, no way.
Come on, you? The Green Goblin?

04:23.935 --> 04:25.270
He's not kidding, Peter.

04:25.479 --> 04:26.938
I don't remember any of it.

04:27.147 --> 04:29.316
But my dad and Spider-Man
figured out...

04:29.524 --> 04:34.988
...my Green-fuelled subconscious
was taking over, making me do things.

04:35.197 --> 04:38.200
At least that's what we all thought
was happening.

04:38.408 --> 04:40.118
Thought? Past tense?

04:40.327 --> 04:42.704
See, this is where it gets confusing.

04:43.038 --> 04:45.582
The reason I've been missing
the last few days?

04:45.791 --> 04:50.170
<i>The Goblin, or someone wearing
a Goblin costume, kidnapped me.</i>

04:50.545 --> 04:53.089
Wait, wait.
There's a second Gobby-- Goblin?

04:53.298 --> 04:55.342
Are you sure this even happened?

04:55.550 --> 04:57.677
You didn't black out and imagine it all?

04:57.886 --> 05:00.597
No. I'm off the juice, I swear.

05:00.806 --> 05:03.934
I've been tempted.

05:05.060 --> 05:09.856
<i>But I destroyed my stash to make sure
I wouldn't-- I couldn't succumb.</i>

05:10.065 --> 05:13.568
I believe you. But you need to tell
all this to your parents.

05:13.777 --> 05:16.404
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

05:16.613 --> 05:19.157
Your dad helped
when he thought you were the Goblin.

05:19.366 --> 05:20.951
Of course, he'd help you now.

05:21.159 --> 05:25.080
<i>Would he? If Harry's telling the truth,
maybe my first instinct was right.</i>

05:25.288 --> 05:27.082
<i>Maybe Norman Osborn is the Goblin.</i>

05:27.415 --> 05:30.919
Okay. I'll talk to him.

05:31.336 --> 05:34.172
<i>With Spidey on the scene, just in case.</i>

05:35.423 --> 05:37.676
Thanks, both of you.

05:37.884 --> 05:40.679
I couldn't ask for two better friends.

05:42.806 --> 05:44.975
- I should go too.
- Yeah.

05:48.854 --> 05:51.106
No. Honesty time.

05:51.314 --> 05:53.024
Look, I made a mess of things.

05:53.233 --> 05:56.069
Look, you kissed me, and I--

05:56.278 --> 05:59.072
Look, I'm not even sure how I wound up
with Liz...

05:59.281 --> 06:01.116
...or how you wound up with Harry.

06:01.324 --> 06:03.201
And they're both great...

06:03.410 --> 06:04.995
...but, Gwen...

06:05.203 --> 06:07.289
...you're the one I wanna be with.

06:08.748 --> 06:11.877
- If you don't feel the same way, I--
- Peter.

06:12.627 --> 06:15.881
I've been in love with you
since seventh grade.

06:21.428 --> 06:24.764
No.
No, not behind Harry's back or Liz's.

06:24.973 --> 06:28.101
Right, right.
We have to break it off with them first.

06:28.310 --> 06:31.813
- It'll be hard, but...
- Then we can be together.

06:34.357 --> 06:36.943
And then I escaped.

06:37.152 --> 06:39.362
Please, Dad, you've got to believe me.

06:39.571 --> 06:43.158
I want to, son.
But I'm just not sure we can trust you.

06:43.366 --> 06:47.662
Maybe it's Normie who can't be trusted.
Last Halloween, I followed Goblin here...

06:47.871 --> 06:49.372
<i>...and I saw Osborn Senior...</i>

06:49.581 --> 06:52.584
<i>...come out of the secret room
behind that suit of armour.</i>

06:53.001 --> 06:56.421
You mean the wine cellar?
That's not exactly a secret.

06:56.630 --> 07:01.259
Mr. Osborn. Master Harry. Spider-Man.

07:01.927 --> 07:03.094
Okay. I give up.

07:03.303 --> 07:05.722
Which one of you is the Goblin?

07:05.931 --> 07:08.350
I've got this handled, dear.

07:09.184 --> 07:11.895
Spider-Man, your suspicion is natural.

07:12.103 --> 07:15.231
<i>I was at OsCorp the night
Green Goblin stole the Inhibitor.</i>

07:15.440 --> 07:17.901
<i>Witnesses saw us together.</i>

07:18.276 --> 07:19.402
Harry, get that.

07:20.195 --> 07:22.155
Fine.

07:22.447 --> 07:23.865
Here's the bottom line.

07:24.074 --> 07:27.994
I'm not sure if Harry's telling the truth,
or if he even knows the truth.

07:28.203 --> 07:31.081
Dad, it's Donald Menken.
He says it's urgent.

07:31.665 --> 07:34.668
I apologise, Spider-Man. One moment.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.920
<i>I'm so lost.</i>

07:37.128 --> 07:40.340
<i>I was sure Norman was the Goblin
till I saw Harry wearing the mask.</i>

07:40.548 --> 07:42.676
<i>Now I don't know
if either one is Gobby.</i>

07:42.884 --> 07:45.178
<i>Heck, maybe both of them are.</i>

08:06.992 --> 08:08.034
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

08:08.243 --> 08:10.537
Think fast. Think faster.

08:10.745 --> 08:16.626
Tonight, you're in a particularly
unfriendly neighbourhood, Spider-Man.

08:19.754 --> 08:23.008
Although I will admit,
you have an annoying tendency...

08:23.216 --> 08:25.552
...to, well, survive.

08:25.927 --> 08:29.347
The Green Goblin
has every contingency in place...

08:29.556 --> 08:32.600
...to test the outer limits of that talent.

08:35.520 --> 08:40.316
Until all that remains
is a red and blue stain on the pavement.

08:46.531 --> 08:48.408
Where have I heard that one before?

08:48.616 --> 08:51.161
From every super-villain
I've come up against.

08:51.369 --> 08:54.039
Then perhaps
it would be more original...

08:54.247 --> 08:58.168
...if I simply remained silent
while watching you splat.

09:00.295 --> 09:02.756
Well, it certainly would qualify
as refreshing.

09:11.264 --> 09:12.974
Peek-a-boo.

09:13.933 --> 09:15.477
Nicely played.

09:15.685 --> 09:18.521
But wheels within wheels
are already in motion...

09:18.938 --> 09:23.068
...and I'll be back
to see you crushed beneath them.

09:26.112 --> 09:28.156
Not so fun when you're flying blind?

09:28.364 --> 09:32.660
Too true. More fun to fire blind.

09:41.086 --> 09:42.837
Okay, that was the real deal...

09:43.046 --> 09:45.340
...which means
neither of you was ever the Goblin.

09:45.548 --> 09:47.967
A voice can be mimicked,
technology copied.

09:48.176 --> 09:51.096
It's not the voice, it's words.
Not the tech, but moves.

09:51.304 --> 09:53.890
I'm telling you that was Gobby,
the one and only.

09:54.099 --> 09:57.977
But how did I wind up
in that Goblin costume?

09:58.186 --> 10:00.688
Are you saying someone set me up?

10:00.897 --> 10:02.232
Who? Why?

10:02.440 --> 10:03.817
Hey, one question at a time.

10:04.025 --> 10:06.820
Starting with
who else has access to Globulin Green?

10:10.281 --> 10:13.409
Security, this is Osborn.
Grab Donald Menken.

10:14.119 --> 10:16.746
No. I mean, grab him
and don't let him go.

10:16.955 --> 10:19.999
But, sir, Menken left the premises
an hour ago.

10:20.208 --> 10:21.793
<i>Then get me his home address.</i>

10:22.001 --> 10:25.004
Now. Globulin Green
was my own personal project.

10:25.213 --> 10:29.092
- In hubris, I showed it to my family.
- And we know how that turned out.

10:29.425 --> 10:34.097
Yes, well, at OsCorp, only
Donald Menken knew of its existence.

10:34.305 --> 10:38.268
Sir, Menken's address,
his entire personnel file...

10:38.476 --> 10:39.519
...it's been deleted.

10:40.979 --> 10:42.814
And the only people
who have clearance--

10:43.022 --> 10:45.692
Are myself and Menken.

10:45.900 --> 10:47.152
He's gone to ground.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.571
But Menken nearly destroyed my son.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.197
Worse, he betrayed me.

10:51.573 --> 10:55.160
I promise you, Spider-Man,
I will find him.

10:56.911 --> 10:58.121
- Did you...?
- Not yet.

10:58.329 --> 11:01.082
- Did you?
- No, I'm meeting her for lunch.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.959
Hey, guys. What's up?

11:03.168 --> 11:06.045
- Up? Nothing.
- We were just talking.

11:06.462 --> 11:09.340
No worries. I'm not the dating police.

11:09.549 --> 11:12.051
Dating police. Good one. I gotta go.

11:12.260 --> 11:13.970
Yeah, me too. Bye.

11:14.179 --> 11:15.763
Finally.

11:17.807 --> 11:21.603
Petey, you're putting ketchup
in your fruit cup.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.855
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

11:24.063 --> 11:27.692
I mean, no. I mean, Liz, you and me--

11:28.109 --> 11:30.486
Well, mostly me
because you've been great.

11:30.695 --> 11:34.240
But I just don't think
I've been much of a boyfriend.

11:34.449 --> 11:38.745
So maybe we'd be better off
as just friends.

11:38.953 --> 11:43.208
Are you breaking up with me?

11:44.375 --> 11:46.336
I'm sorry.

11:50.465 --> 11:53.259
You dump me? I don't think so.

11:53.468 --> 11:57.013
That's it, Petey! We're through!

12:00.016 --> 12:01.184
Finally.

12:09.609 --> 12:13.238
- Liz?
- Yeah. Not fun.

12:13.446 --> 12:17.033
- Harry?
- I haven't even seen him.

12:17.242 --> 12:20.870
- I hope it went all right with his parents.
- Our timing does suck.

12:21.079 --> 12:23.122
Dr. Connors, what's going on?

12:23.331 --> 12:27.627
Curt and I are leaving E.S.U.
In fact, we're leaving New York.

12:27.835 --> 12:31.881
I can't go into all the details,
but we had to move on.

12:32.090 --> 12:34.384
But the lab? You're work?

12:34.592 --> 12:36.844
Our work will continue in Florida.

12:37.053 --> 12:40.640
As for the lab, Dr. Warren is in charge.

12:41.015 --> 12:46.980
You and Pete can learn a lot from him.
But, well, don't learn too much.

12:54.445 --> 12:57.865
- Any news on Menken?
-909 Barrow Street. Top floor.

12:58.074 --> 13:00.410
Thanks, Gargan. Cheque's in the mail.

13:01.411 --> 13:03.246
Let's go.

13:04.539 --> 13:05.790
Who ordered the chopper?

13:05.999 --> 13:10.295
OsCorp kind of thinks you did.
I figured, after all he put us through...

13:10.503 --> 13:13.923
...you and I would want some face time
with Goblin-comma-Menken.

13:14.132 --> 13:15.174
Where's the pilot?

13:15.383 --> 13:17.719
You're the one who insisted
I get my licence.

13:28.354 --> 13:30.481
- Moving out?
- Moving in.

13:30.690 --> 13:32.775
Nice decor. Very green.

13:32.984 --> 13:34.193
It came that way.

13:34.402 --> 13:37.739
OsCorp recently rented this apartment
for me.

13:39.073 --> 13:42.702
- I know you're the Green Goblin.
- I have no response to that.

13:57.592 --> 14:02.764
Spray a little knockout gas
and you fold like origami.

14:03.097 --> 14:06.267
I might just have to do
my happy dance.

14:08.061 --> 14:10.938
- Harry, what are you doing?
- Cowboying up.

14:31.876 --> 14:34.295
So Menken's not the Goblin either.

14:34.504 --> 14:36.381
Menken?

14:36.672 --> 14:39.759
Seriously? You bought that?

15:19.215 --> 15:20.800
<i>This can't be good.</i>

15:30.893 --> 15:33.521
<i>He's booby-trapped the whole city.</i>

15:38.317 --> 15:41.112
<i>And the Gob Squad's out in force too.
Perfect.</i>

16:20.276 --> 16:23.279
If it's not me or you or Menken...

16:23.488 --> 16:26.199
...then who's left
that knew about the Green?

16:26.532 --> 16:30.244
You don't think
the Goblin could be Mom?

17:04.529 --> 17:06.614
What's wrong, Spider-Man?

17:06.821 --> 17:09.032
Off your game?

17:13.204 --> 17:16.249
No. Game's good, Gobs.
Just getting acquainted with the rules.

17:16.457 --> 17:19.835
Rule one, Spidey must splat.

17:20.211 --> 17:23.548
Rule two, ignore rule one.

17:27.885 --> 17:31.889
Rule three, make Gobby look goofy.

17:48.739 --> 17:51.284
- Dad?
- Son, he's obviously an imposter.

17:51.492 --> 17:53.327
Right, right.

17:53.536 --> 17:58.374
Except I heard you apologise
to Spider-Man last night.

17:58.583 --> 18:02.545
Norman Osborn never apologizes.

18:03.838 --> 18:06.549
I did not sign on for this.

18:12.471 --> 18:13.598
Chameleon.

18:13.806 --> 18:17.643
Then you--
You were the Goblin all along.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.153
I told you I invented the Green.

18:27.361 --> 18:29.655
<i>Of course,
I wasn't fool enough to drink it.</i>

18:29.864 --> 18:35.161
<i>Small doses in gaseous form increased
my strength, agility, intelligence...</i>

18:35.369 --> 18:38.414
...with no blackouts, no loss of control.

18:38.623 --> 18:41.334
You've been working with Chameleon
the whole time?

18:41.542 --> 18:44.128
Not at first.
As Goblin, I appeared at OsCorp...

18:44.337 --> 18:46.422
<i>...to steal my Gob-Web Inhibitor.</i>

18:46.631 --> 18:50.968
<i>Imagine my pleasure at finding
Norman Osborn a witness to my crime.</i>

18:51.177 --> 18:52.553
<i>It was Chameleon, of course...</i>

18:52.762 --> 18:55.306
<i>...stealing Os Corp secrets
for</i> a <i>competitor.</i>

18:55.514 --> 18:58.851
So this week, I hired him
to keep you guessing...

18:59.060 --> 19:02.188
...and set you up for a fall.

19:04.315 --> 19:08.069
But last Halloween, you crashed,
the Goblin crashed.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.946
And you saw me limp away.

19:11.822 --> 19:14.784
<i>Do you know how easy it is
to fake a limp?</i>

19:14.992 --> 19:16.369
But Harry wasn't faking.

19:16.577 --> 19:19.372
<i>When I found him,
he was wearing Goblin's costume...</i>

19:19.580 --> 19:22.333
<i>-...and his leg was hurt.</i>
- More <i>serendipity.</i>

19:22.541 --> 19:24.126
<i>You had guessed my identity.</i>

19:24.335 --> 19:26.671
<i>I knew I had to redirect your suspicion.</i>

19:26.879 --> 19:28.130
<i>And when I returned home...</i>

19:28.339 --> 19:30.966
...I <i>found Harry,
passed out from an overdose of Green.</i>

19:31.175 --> 19:34.720
<i>It didn't take long to deduce the cause
of Harry's sudden success...</i>

19:34.929 --> 19:36.555
<i>...at football and in school.</i>

19:36.764 --> 19:39.975
<i>It took only slightly longer
to dress him as the Goblin.</i>

19:40.601 --> 19:43.896
<i>The limp completed the illusion.</i>

19:44.105 --> 19:47.525
- You framed your own son?
- I protected Harry.

19:47.733 --> 19:51.779
If I'd been sent to prison,
who'd have made a man out of him?

19:56.283 --> 19:58.327
Just look at what he's done today.

19:58.536 --> 20:00.830
I've never been prouder of the boy.

20:01.038 --> 20:04.625
Who are you kidding? You were saving
your own sorry butt, not Harry's.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.085
Potato, potato.

20:06.293 --> 20:09.964
Once you're out of the picture,
I'll make everything right.

20:10.881 --> 20:14.093
You wouldn't know right
if it blew up your glider.

20:22.351 --> 20:24.311
Dad!

20:28.941 --> 20:30.526
Dad was sick.

20:30.735 --> 20:32.778
A victim of the Green.

20:33.112 --> 20:36.115
No one knows how that stuff
changes you better than I do.

20:36.323 --> 20:40.161
Spider-Man should have helped him,
not...

20:42.788 --> 20:45.416
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Gwen.

20:45.750 --> 20:49.420
You're all that's keeping me
from going back on the Green myself.

20:51.046 --> 20:53.007
I got your messages.

20:53.215 --> 20:56.051
Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

20:57.595 --> 20:59.472
It was nothing.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.349
<i>Another banner episode
in the life of Peter Parker.</i>

21:02.558 --> 21:04.727
<i>Harry's left with no father.</i>

21:05.394 --> 21:07.438
<i>I'm left with no Gwen.</i>

21:07.646 --> 21:09.815
<i>Well, at least the city's safe.</i>

21:10.024 --> 21:12.735
<i>The Green Goblin's gone forever.</i>

21:13.486 --> 21:16.280
<i>Now boarding Flight 1057 to Miami.</i>

21:16.489 --> 21:21.452
Time to start a brand-new adventure,
a brand-new life.

21:21.660 --> 21:26.791
<i>Flight 994 to Grand Cayman Island
is now boarding all first class rows.</i>

21:27.124 --> 21:29.502
Sorry for the delay, Mr. Roman.

21:29.710 --> 21:31.295
Don't apologise.

21:31.712 --> 21:34.882
I never do.
