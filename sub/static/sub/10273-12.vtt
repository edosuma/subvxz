<i>Previously on The Americans...</i>

00:03.610 --> 00:06.446
<i>All you have to do</i>
<i>is put the clock back.</i>

00:06.514 --> 00:07.781
I don't have to listen to you.

00:07.848 --> 00:09.182
I listen to my lord.

00:09.250 --> 00:10.950
No! I'll do it!
I'll do it!

00:11.018 --> 00:12.118
I'm in love with you.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.555
And I would do
anything for you.

00:14.623 --> 00:15.990
What was so urgent?

00:16.058 --> 00:19.693
Mom, daddy,
I'd like you to meet Clark.

00:19.761 --> 00:20.727
Hi.

00:20.795 --> 00:22.796
It's a studio.

00:22.863 --> 00:24.530
It's time you and your source

00:24.598 --> 00:25.998
started having your meetings
in a safe house.

00:26.066 --> 00:28.868
You don't
want to be married to me?

00:28.936 --> 00:31.538
I don't think the Centre
would even care.

00:31.605 --> 00:33.306
Dad is going to be

00:33.374 --> 00:35.175
staying somewhere else
for a little while.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.878
This is your fault! You're
always giving dad a rough time!

00:37.946 --> 00:39.680
Who the hell are you?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.081
A friend of Adam Dorwin,
who recruited you.

00:41.149 --> 00:42.516
I was very fond of Adam.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.219
I can't say the same
about you, Sandford,

00:44.286 --> 00:45.487
since we've only just met.

00:47.723 --> 00:49.557
- Who killed Vlad?
- I don't know.

00:49.625 --> 00:51.893
There's a team
at Livermore Labs.

00:51.961 --> 00:53.829
They've had a breakthrough.

00:53.896 --> 00:55.330
It's only a matter of time.

I don't like surprises,
Sandford.

01:10.581 --> 01:11.681
Well, you'll like this one.

01:11.749 --> 01:13.249
Hey.

01:13.317 --> 01:14.785
You want something?

01:14.852 --> 01:16.586
- Guinness.
- Hm.

01:19.190 --> 01:20.457
I recruited somebody--

01:20.525 --> 01:22.525
a colonel
in Air Force Intelligence

01:22.593 --> 01:24.026
who works in the anti-ballistic
missile program.

01:24.094 --> 01:25.528
You did what?!

01:25.596 --> 01:27.730
I did it the way
Adam Dorwin recruited me.

01:27.798 --> 01:29.899
I spent a lot of time
talking to the guy,

01:29.967 --> 01:32.402
built up a bond of trust,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:32.470 --> 01:34.304
Dorwin did not recruit you
on his own.

01:34.372 --> 01:36.773
He followed our instructions,
every step of the way.

01:36.841 --> 01:40.311
Listen, listen, this colonel
is way up the food chain.

01:40.379 --> 01:42.213
He's got
incredible information.

01:42.280 --> 01:43.314
Did you see it?

01:43.382 --> 01:44.882
- Some of it.
- Show it to me.

01:44.950 --> 01:46.417
I don't have it on me.

01:46.484 --> 01:48.219
- It's for sale.
- By who?

01:48.286 --> 01:50.922
Well, it's his information,
but I'm the vector.

01:50.990 --> 01:53.291
You want it,
you got to go through me.

01:56.562 --> 01:57.796
How much?

01:57.863 --> 01:58.897
50 grand.

02:01.133 --> 02:03.134
We playing at the big-boy table
now, Sandford?

02:03.201 --> 02:06.570
- I swear this is great stuff.
- Here you go.

02:12.310 --> 02:14.745
How do you know we can trust
this colonel?

02:14.813 --> 02:16.246
He's hit the wall.

02:16.314 --> 02:17.748
He's completely disillusioned

02:17.816 --> 02:19.784
with the chickenhawks
in the Reagan administration.

02:19.851 --> 02:22.019
It's a gold mine,
I'm telling you.

02:22.087 --> 02:23.754
We'll see.

02:23.822 --> 02:25.823
You want it or not?

02:28.827 --> 02:32.797
$50,000 buys
a lot of poker chips.

02:32.865 --> 02:35.667
If your information's
as good as you say it is,

02:35.735 --> 02:37.102
you'll get your money.

02:37.169 --> 02:38.837
But I need to know
what I'm buying.

02:40.773 --> 02:43.041
Signal me once you load in

02:43.109 --> 02:44.610
what you've got
at your dead drop site.

02:44.677 --> 02:47.513
Then we'll talk.

05:55.934 --> 05:57.788
Gamblers are unreliable.

05:57.859 --> 06:00.026
The Centre never should have
okayed Prince's recruitment.

06:00.094 --> 06:02.629
True, but all his intelligence
has been good.

06:02.697 --> 06:05.298
Yeah, so far.

06:05.366 --> 06:09.068
If Prince really did recruit
an Air-Force colonel,

06:09.136 --> 06:11.638
it would be
our highest-level source ever

06:11.705 --> 06:13.773
in Reagan's
missile-defense program.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.108
Or he's setting us up.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.779
- Did you talk to Paige?
- About what?

06:19.847 --> 06:21.480
Having dinner at my place.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.617
Um...

06:27.120 --> 06:29.288
Yeah, it's fine, of course.

06:29.356 --> 06:30.723
Great.

06:30.791 --> 06:34.094
She said you put
some stuff up on the walls.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.162
Just a calendar.

06:36.230 --> 06:39.065
Oh, you need to make her another
set of keys to your place.

06:39.133 --> 06:40.801
Why?

06:40.868 --> 06:43.470
Henry took the set you gave her
and buried it in the backyard.

06:43.538 --> 06:46.240
Won't tell us where.

06:48.610 --> 06:50.445
Are you okay with this?

06:50.512 --> 06:53.681
With this?

06:53.749 --> 06:56.050
This arrangement--
the apartment.

06:56.118 --> 06:59.020
Absolutely.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.862
_

09:14.008 --> 09:15.388
_

09:17.222 --> 09:21.525
Our savior illuminates
the darkness.

09:21.593 --> 09:25.662
He shines his heavenly light--
his cleansing light--

09:25.730 --> 09:29.366
on a righteous path,
showing us the way.

09:29.434 --> 09:33.771
Now, Lucifer
thrives in darkness.

09:33.838 --> 09:39.343
He places his stones,
his lies, in dark places

09:39.411 --> 09:42.780
so that we will stumble
and fall from grace

09:42.848 --> 09:44.815
into eternal damnation.

09:44.883 --> 09:47.985
You see, lies are
the Devil's handmaidens.

09:48.053 --> 09:51.022
They are his sword
and his shield.

09:51.089 --> 09:54.825
They weigh down our hearts
with sorrow and corruption.

09:54.893 --> 09:59.363
They banish us
from the kingdom yet to come.

09:59.431 --> 10:02.699
Now and forevermore.

10:02.767 --> 10:04.234
Amen.

10:04.302 --> 10:06.203
- Amen. - Amen.
- Amen. - Amen.

10:06.270 --> 10:07.404
Amen.

10:20.619 --> 10:23.253
You're good at games.
I'll give you that.

10:23.321 --> 10:27.391
I enjoy the maze part, and
the eating-without-eating part.

10:27.459 --> 10:29.593
Pac-dots are calorie-free.

10:31.829 --> 10:34.265
What's the verdict
on the Prince intelligence?

10:34.332 --> 10:37.068
Science and technical officers
at the Rezidentura

10:37.136 --> 10:38.770
- made a cursory review.
- And?

10:38.838 --> 10:41.707
It's 10 years ahead of
anything we have in the field.

10:41.774 --> 10:44.509
So you think
the colonel's for real.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.245
US Intelligence would never
give up anything this valuable

10:47.312 --> 10:49.013
as part of a trap.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.952
Philip and I both question
Prince's motives.

10:55.020 --> 10:57.254
He says $50,000 is his motive.

10:57.322 --> 10:59.056
I think that's believable.

10:59.123 --> 11:01.258
Think how much Prince could get
from the FBI

11:01.325 --> 11:03.693
for delivering a Directorate
"S" officer to them.

11:03.761 --> 11:06.029
He'd be swimming
in very deep water.

11:06.097 --> 11:08.265
He doesn't strike me
as the type.

11:13.705 --> 11:17.709
The FBI could be behind it
without Prince being aware.

11:17.776 --> 11:19.577
They could be controlling
the source

11:19.645 --> 11:22.247
and waiting for a meeting
to be set up with the colonel.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.616
A meeting has been set.

11:24.683 --> 11:28.386
The colonel put the time and
location for us on a microdot.

11:28.454 --> 11:30.622
He also said the technical
information he sent

11:30.690 --> 11:32.324
was just to prove
he's for real.

11:32.392 --> 11:36.095
He says that he has
something truly vital for us,

11:36.163 --> 11:38.331
but he can only give that to us
in person.

11:38.398 --> 11:42.234
A trap is always a possibility.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.169
But in this case,
it's worth the risk.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.640
That's easy to say
from the sidelines.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.576
Don't get your panties
in a bunch, Elizabeth.

11:50.644 --> 11:52.378
This isn't about you and me.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.518
The Centre wants the meeting
with the colonel to proceed.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.523
I don't trust a word
that bitch says.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.125
I mean, who knows
what she could be up to?

12:06.193 --> 12:07.793
So, let's contact the Centre.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.662
Make sure her orders are real.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.364
Tell them
to bring her back home.

12:11.432 --> 12:12.599
Assign us a new handler.

12:12.667 --> 12:13.967
I am done.

12:14.035 --> 12:15.135
We should've done this
a long time ago.

12:15.203 --> 12:17.137
I've never liked her.

12:17.205 --> 12:21.175
There's one more move
we could make

12:21.243 --> 12:23.878
to see if the meeting with
the colonel is an FBI set-up.

12:23.946 --> 12:25.046
What?

12:25.113 --> 12:28.449
We put a bug in Gaad's office.

12:30.218 --> 12:31.952
Right.

12:32.020 --> 12:35.322
If the FBI are running an
operation to trap KGB officers,

12:35.390 --> 12:37.157
chances are
they're talking about it.

12:37.225 --> 12:39.860
Philip, there is no way we'll
get a bug in Gaad's office.

12:41.462 --> 12:43.163
Martha could do it.

12:43.231 --> 12:46.800
No knock on your charms there,
Romeo,

12:46.868 --> 12:48.869
but there's no way
she'll go for that.

12:48.936 --> 12:52.606
She'll go for it.

13:08.678 --> 13:10.901
_

13:11.065 --> 13:12.778
_

13:13.926 --> 13:15.961
_

13:16.164 --> 13:19.389

13:19.786 --> 13:21.409

13:21.516 --> 13:23.358
_

13:25.500 --> 13:28.063
_

13:28.635 --> 13:30.593
_

13:30.746 --> 13:33.190
_

13:49.062 --> 13:50.426
Ooh, gotcha.

13:50.494 --> 13:51.654
Pitch one in here, pitcher.

13:51.722 --> 13:53.052
Okay, go. Arc it.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.150
Ooh.

13:54.218 --> 13:56.809
Right on the teeth.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.604
Come on.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.932
- Ooh! There we go!
- Now we're in the ballpark.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.594
- Your turn. Heads up.
- All right. I'm ready.

14:02.662 --> 14:05.654
Ready?

14:06.920 --> 14:08.581
- Oh! There it is!
- Oh!

14:15.269 --> 14:16.996
Hi.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.357
I could hear you guys laughing
out in the hall.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.483
Are you early?

14:21.551 --> 14:22.815
No, I-I'm right on time.

14:22.883 --> 14:23.746
I'll get your mac and cheese.

14:23.813 --> 14:25.178
All right.

14:25.245 --> 14:29.169
Um, do you have everything
that you brought?

14:29.237 --> 14:30.497
Your homework and...

14:30.565 --> 14:32.296
I didn't really get to it.

14:36.052 --> 14:38.173
So, I don't have
any tupperware yet.

14:38.241 --> 14:39.994
Just give me the bowl back
when you're done.

14:40.061 --> 14:41.122
Okay.

14:41.190 --> 14:43.845
Three cheeses. Right?

14:43.912 --> 14:45.342
- Bye, dad.
- Bye.

14:45.405 --> 14:46.801
Bye, sweetheart.

14:50.059 --> 14:52.347
Okay.

14:59.926 --> 15:02.581
Shit.

15:02.649 --> 15:06.368
I mean, really,
driving all the way to Leesburg?

15:06.435 --> 15:09.028
Isn't there such a thing
as being too careful?

15:09.096 --> 15:11.221
No.
Actually, there isn't.

15:11.284 --> 15:14.177
And if you ask me, our--

15:14.240 --> 15:17.863
our secret makes it
that much more romantic.

15:17.931 --> 15:20.219
I would love to share
our relationship, Clark.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.313
I would like to shout it
from the rooftops.

15:22.381 --> 15:27.797
One day, Martha, I-I promise--
just... not now.

15:27.865 --> 15:29.557
Here you go, sir.

15:31.088 --> 15:32.613
What's this?

15:32.681 --> 15:34.607
I believe
it's called champagne.

15:34.674 --> 15:36.433
Are we celebrating?

15:36.501 --> 15:39.127
I certainly hope so.

15:48.660 --> 15:49.688
Thank you.

15:49.756 --> 15:51.348
- Great. Thank you.
- Enjoy.

15:55.301 --> 15:58.256
Martha...

15:58.324 --> 16:00.020
I want you to close your eyes.

16:00.083 --> 16:02.843
And I want you to concentrate.

16:02.911 --> 16:06.696
But don't say anything
until I'm done, okay?

16:06.763 --> 16:10.248
Okay.

16:17.325 --> 16:18.253
"M"...

16:18.321 --> 16:20.580
Shh. Shh. Shh.

16:25.030 --> 16:30.613
"A," "R"...

16:30.681 --> 16:36.260
"R"...

16:36.327 --> 16:37.723
"Y."

16:40.414 --> 16:41.510
Yes.
Oh, yes!

16:41.578 --> 16:43.237
Yes, I will marry you, Clark.

16:43.304 --> 16:45.598
Yes. Yes. Yes.

16:48.088 --> 16:49.947
Oh, yes.

16:52.408 --> 16:54.067
- Wow.
- Thank you.

16:54.135 --> 16:55.098
Wow.

17:11.751 --> 17:13.218
I was worried.

17:13.286 --> 17:15.554
I'm sorry.
I was detained at work.

17:15.621 --> 17:18.790
I can't stay.

17:18.858 --> 17:20.325
Is everything all right?

17:20.393 --> 17:21.992
Nothing is ever all right.

17:22.060 --> 17:24.396
Arkady is expecting me.

17:24.463 --> 17:26.131
Something going on
I need to know about?

17:26.198 --> 17:29.834
Sonya met a deputy chief of
mission at the French embassy.

17:29.902 --> 17:31.970
They've had lunch twice.

17:32.037 --> 17:33.705
She developing him?

17:33.773 --> 17:34.840
Yes.

17:34.907 --> 17:36.708
Arkady thinks he's vulnerable.

17:36.776 --> 17:40.011
Is he intel or--
or legit diplomat?

17:40.079 --> 17:41.213
We don't know yet.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.181
She's meeting him again
next week.

17:43.249 --> 17:45.317
Good.

17:45.384 --> 17:47.485
Are you okay?

17:47.553 --> 17:49.020
Now I am.

17:49.088 --> 17:50.855
You?

17:50.923 --> 17:55.260
I don't know.

17:55.328 --> 17:57.929
Come here.

18:06.404 --> 18:09.773
I had a dream about you.

18:09.841 --> 18:11.174
Oh, you did?

18:11.242 --> 18:13.110
A good one, I hope.

18:13.178 --> 18:16.213
I was in a fire,
a burning building--

18:16.281 --> 18:18.115
the Rezidentura, maybe.

18:18.182 --> 18:19.549
I don't know.

18:19.617 --> 18:23.052
There was so much smoke
I couldn't see anything.

18:23.120 --> 18:26.856
But then I saw you.

18:26.924 --> 18:33.962
You came through the fire
and the smoke and everything.

18:39.835 --> 18:41.469
Did I save you?

18:41.536 --> 18:43.237
Who knows?

18:43.305 --> 18:44.805
I woke up.

18:44.873 --> 18:49.210
I was safe, but you were gone.

18:56.953 --> 18:58.453
It was you.

19:03.325 --> 19:05.394
Did you kill Vlad?

19:13.836 --> 19:17.105
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

19:17.173 --> 19:20.843
You know that.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.386
Let me.

19:47.172 --> 19:49.107
I want to take your name.

19:49.174 --> 19:50.808
What?

19:50.876 --> 19:54.145
I know it's not what the modern
woman does these days,

19:54.213 --> 19:57.482
but I want to be
Mrs. Clark Westerfeld.

19:57.550 --> 19:59.451
Martha, you can't take my name.

19:59.519 --> 20:00.452
I know. I know.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.154
Mr. rules and regulations.

20:02.221 --> 20:03.788
Look...

20:03.856 --> 20:07.292
there is nothing I would like
more than to be able to say,

20:07.360 --> 20:09.962
"this is my wife,
Martha Westerfeld."

20:10.029 --> 20:11.396
But there's no need.

20:11.464 --> 20:15.200
You're already right here.

20:15.268 --> 20:17.202
Aww.

20:24.944 --> 20:27.879
Oh, you have the look
on your face.

20:27.947 --> 20:30.816
You have the "Martha, I need to ask
you something important" look.

20:31.885 --> 20:34.220
Wow.
Am I that predictable?

20:34.287 --> 20:36.022
Mm-hmm.

20:36.089 --> 20:39.425
But I've dated
nothing but unpredictable

20:39.493 --> 20:41.327
since I was 15 years old.

20:41.395 --> 20:44.196
So I'm ready for Steady Freddy.

20:44.264 --> 20:46.365
Wow. Okay.

20:48.067 --> 20:51.736
Uh, well, here's the thing,
my wife-to-be.

20:54.306 --> 20:56.907
Agent Gaad...

20:56.975 --> 20:57.908
Is my boss.

20:57.976 --> 20:59.510
Hm?

20:59.577 --> 21:03.513
Right, and the next time
your boss is out of the office,

21:03.581 --> 21:05.382
I would like you to do me
a favor.

21:05.449 --> 21:09.252
What kind of favor?

21:25.603 --> 21:29.205
I need you to place this
in Agent Gaad's office.

21:29.273 --> 21:33.443
Somewhere where he won't
notice it or pick it up.

21:33.510 --> 21:35.745
Keep this in your purse

21:35.813 --> 21:37.981
because I'll need to check it
when we meet at night.

21:42.487 --> 21:45.288
Clark, you, uh...

21:45.356 --> 21:47.491
You came out of nowhere,

21:47.559 --> 21:49.159
like some sign
from the universe

21:49.227 --> 21:50.895
that, after a lot
of crappy years,

21:50.962 --> 21:53.230
things would be okay.

21:55.967 --> 21:57.901
Are things gonna be okay,
Clark?

21:57.969 --> 22:02.640
I mean... just please tell me
that they'll be okay.

22:02.708 --> 22:05.677
They will.
I promise.

22:05.745 --> 22:07.379
I'm right here.

22:11.751 --> 22:16.422
There's-- I have a lot of
good reasons for all of this,

22:16.489 --> 22:19.092
and I can go into them
if you want,

22:19.159 --> 22:22.662
but look at me--
look me in the eyes.

22:22.730 --> 22:26.066
Do you want me to,
or do you trust me?

22:29.771 --> 22:31.939
I trust you.

22:32.006 --> 22:34.041
I love you.

22:45.921 --> 22:48.356
Could you make up
the guest room, Viola?

22:48.424 --> 22:50.959
The Eppersons will be
staying with us this weekend.

22:51.027 --> 22:53.361
Deborah loves
lilacs and chocolate.

22:53.429 --> 22:54.963
Well, I'll leave her some
by the bed.

22:55.030 --> 22:56.464
Thank you.

22:56.532 --> 22:59.367
Can I talk to you for a minute,
Mrs. Weinberger?

22:59.435 --> 23:01.002
Uh...

23:01.070 --> 23:03.171
In the other room?

23:05.074 --> 23:07.142
Of course.

23:11.447 --> 23:14.082
I didn't want to do it.
I swear.

23:14.150 --> 23:15.917
We know that.

23:20.956 --> 23:22.357
I was afraid.

23:22.425 --> 23:25.493
Not for myself--
for Grayson.

23:25.561 --> 23:28.730
They made him very sick.

23:28.798 --> 23:31.766
They said they could help him,

23:31.834 --> 23:35.169
that they were the <i>only</i> ones
who could help him.

23:35.236 --> 23:39.339
But if I said anything,
Grayson was gonna die.

23:39.407 --> 23:44.177
He put a pillow to his face

23:44.245 --> 23:48.582
and said he'd be dead
in 15 seconds.

23:48.649 --> 23:53.354
I begged him--
I begged him to stop.

23:53.421 --> 23:58.192
So I said I'd do it.

23:58.259 --> 24:00.360
I put the clock...

24:00.428 --> 24:04.597
back into Mr. Weinberger's office.

24:08.670 --> 24:11.472
You're a very brave woman.

24:14.543 --> 24:17.110
I'm gonna call in
a sketch artist.

24:17.178 --> 24:19.112
Would that be okay?

24:19.180 --> 24:21.448
Yes.

24:27.121 --> 24:28.922
This is big.

24:28.990 --> 24:30.657
The CIA officer who was nabbed
at the wheel house--

24:30.725 --> 24:32.258
Richard Patterson.

24:32.326 --> 24:35.062
He was taken by a couple--
a man and a woman.

24:35.129 --> 24:37.297
That is no coincidence.

24:37.365 --> 24:39.366
No.

24:43.138 --> 24:45.940
♪ Way down around Vicksburg ♪

24:46.007 --> 24:49.110
♪ around Louisiana Way ♪

24:49.177 --> 24:52.914
♪ there lived a cajun lady ♪

24:52.982 --> 24:55.216
♪ aboard the Mississippi Queen ♪

25:03.059 --> 25:05.494
Wow.
I thought you guys sounded good.

25:05.562 --> 25:06.428
Thanks.

25:07.497 --> 25:09.632
Hey. Door was open.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.301
Oh, hey.
Thanks for coming.

25:12.369 --> 25:15.105
Should I plug in, or...?

25:15.172 --> 25:16.606
We only have one amp.

25:16.674 --> 25:19.609
Hmm.
Well, what are you guys playing?

25:19.677 --> 25:21.110
I could just come in
on some vocals or whatever.

25:21.178 --> 25:22.345
Yeah. Cool.

25:22.413 --> 25:24.882
Yeah, you can play my guitar
for now.

25:24.949 --> 25:27.418
They were doing
"Mississippi Queen."

25:29.855 --> 25:32.189
- I'm Paige.
- Sarah.

25:32.257 --> 25:34.659
- Are you in the band?
- No.

25:34.726 --> 25:36.527
Yeah, she's just watching.

25:36.595 --> 25:38.696
So, should we?

25:57.316 --> 26:00.152
Totally.
Let's play again.

26:02.321 --> 26:05.023
She sounds like Pat Benatar.

26:05.091 --> 26:08.093
And he called her
"righteous."

26:08.160 --> 26:09.894
Feelings come and go, honey.

26:09.962 --> 26:12.029
It doesn't mean
the battle is lost.

26:12.097 --> 26:15.066
I don't want to fight
for his feelings, mom.

26:15.133 --> 26:17.701
Either he's into me
or he's not.

26:17.769 --> 26:18.936
And he's not.

26:22.908 --> 26:24.842
How well do you even know
Matthew?

26:24.910 --> 26:27.578
I mean, I know you like him,
you think he's smart.

26:27.646 --> 26:30.048
Maybe you like
the way he looks at you

26:30.115 --> 26:32.217
underneath
all that hair of his.

26:34.454 --> 26:39.692
But the thing
to understand is that...

26:39.759 --> 26:42.895
we see what we need to see
in people--

26:42.962 --> 26:45.865
things that aren't
really there.

26:49.970 --> 26:53.105
Is that what happened
with you and dad?

26:55.208 --> 26:58.110
Did you need to see something
in him that wasn't really there?

27:07.887 --> 27:09.622
No.

27:09.689 --> 27:11.457
It was there.

27:13.620 --> 27:16.629
You should finish
your French homework.

27:30.410 --> 27:31.410
It's off now.

27:31.411 --> 27:33.379
How do you know?

27:33.446 --> 27:35.014
I can read its signature.

27:35.081 --> 27:38.417
There's no signal at the moment,
but it's fully functional.

27:38.485 --> 27:39.885
How long has it been here?

27:39.953 --> 27:41.520
A few months.

27:41.588 --> 27:45.158
It's extremely sensitive--
a Russian version of our 3VX.

27:45.225 --> 27:46.425
State-of-the-art.

27:46.493 --> 27:49.028
Built to filter out
ambient sound.

27:49.096 --> 27:52.765
Okay, you can put it
back together.

27:52.833 --> 27:55.402
You're just gonna
leave it like that?

27:55.469 --> 27:56.836
Ma'am?

27:56.904 --> 27:59.406
The clock
with the... thing in it.

27:59.474 --> 28:01.575
It's all right,
Mrs. Weinberger.

28:01.643 --> 28:03.844
Your husband's been briefed.

28:03.912 --> 28:05.913
Now that we know
they're listening,

28:05.980 --> 28:07.214
we'll know what to say.

28:23.598 --> 28:24.965
- Martha.
- Ohh!

28:25.033 --> 28:26.200
Jumpy.

28:26.268 --> 28:30.939
Um... I was daydreaming.
Thank you.

28:31.006 --> 28:33.408
These are the surveillance
reports that you requested.

28:33.476 --> 28:36.044
- Just put them on my desk.
- Okay. Um...

28:36.112 --> 28:38.580
- Was there something or...?
- Yes.

28:38.648 --> 28:42.718
I need to re-schedule
my 2:30 with Tennyson for 5:00.

28:42.785 --> 28:45.821
Okay.

28:45.888 --> 28:47.422
Martha.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.724
Yes?

28:49.792 --> 28:51.160
I'm sorry I startled you.

28:51.228 --> 28:53.330
Not to worry.

29:24.598 --> 29:26.766
Clark, I'm sorry I woke you.

29:26.834 --> 29:28.501
Come on in.
This couldn't wait.

29:28.569 --> 29:30.503
What is it?

29:30.571 --> 29:33.473
Um...

29:33.541 --> 29:35.542
I like to think
that I'm a practical person.

29:35.609 --> 29:37.544
Yeah. I think
that's what we like about--

29:37.612 --> 29:39.879
that's what we love
about each other.

29:39.947 --> 29:42.115
So I made
a pro-and-con list.

29:42.183 --> 29:43.449
Um...

29:43.517 --> 29:44.918
I mean, look.

29:47.455 --> 29:50.824
I can't even tell my parents?

29:50.892 --> 29:53.326
Okay.

29:53.394 --> 29:56.262
All right.

29:59.100 --> 30:02.168
Martha, with my job
and my security clearance,

30:02.236 --> 30:06.405
if my superiors were to find out
I was even secretly dating,

30:06.473 --> 30:08.173
let alone married to someone

30:08.241 --> 30:11.309
I'm supposed to be overseeing
in an investigation,

30:11.377 --> 30:12.678
I could go to jail.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.648
I bought rings, you know.

30:25.791 --> 30:28.325
Listen.

30:34.433 --> 30:39.336
I just want to be sure that
you're going into this thing...

30:39.404 --> 30:41.705
Marriage.

30:41.773 --> 30:44.909
...with both eyes open.

30:44.976 --> 30:49.279
Because we won't
be able to live together.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.849
I'll stay when I can,
of course,

30:51.916 --> 30:55.619
but, Martha, no one-- no one--
can know about this.

30:55.687 --> 31:01.125
Not for the foreseeable future,
anyway.

31:07.867 --> 31:11.135
I have to come clean with you
about something.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.538
I've been married before.

31:13.606 --> 31:17.442
A long time ago--
it didn't work out.

31:17.510 --> 31:18.543
Why not?

31:18.611 --> 31:20.112
It's funny.

31:20.179 --> 31:21.747
It's something I've been
thinking a lot about lately,

31:21.815 --> 31:24.216
but I realized that...

31:27.453 --> 31:32.090
...me and my ex-wife--
we-- we didn't care enough.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.826
What do you mean?

31:34.894 --> 31:38.229
What I mean is,
we cared about each other,

31:38.297 --> 31:42.100
but we didn't know
how to be married.

31:42.167 --> 31:44.135
Does that sound silly?

31:44.203 --> 31:46.804
No. It sounds sad.

31:46.872 --> 31:49.574
And I'm sorry, Clark,

31:49.641 --> 31:53.945
but I can't do this
if we can't tell my parents.

31:54.012 --> 31:57.515
Because this kind of happiness,
really, it's--

31:57.583 --> 32:00.251
it's all they've ever wanted
for me.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.521
But can we trust them?

32:02.588 --> 32:06.258
They live 2,000 miles away
at the end of an old dirt road,

32:06.325 --> 32:07.826
and all they care about is me.

32:07.894 --> 32:08.961
Yes, we can trust them.

32:09.028 --> 32:11.163
Well, then, okay.

32:11.231 --> 32:13.732
- Okay?
- Yes. Okay.

32:20.373 --> 32:23.174
Thank you.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.477
Clark, I don't want to wait.

32:25.544 --> 32:26.978
Let's just get married
this weekend.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.980
Let's just find someone
to marry us and let's do it.

32:30.048 --> 32:31.448
Let's just do it our way.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.584
Till death do us part.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.465
<i>The budget is</i>
<i>what the budget is.</i>

32:47.532 --> 32:48.999
<i>If that's a problem,</i>

32:49.067 --> 32:50.534
<i>we'll bring it up</i>
<i>with the Deputy AG</i>

32:50.602 --> 32:52.069
<i>when we meet with him tomorrow.</i>

32:52.137 --> 32:53.871
Yeah, that's it.

32:53.939 --> 32:56.340
Our first day live
in Gaad's office.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.676
No mention of Prince
or any meeting with the colonel.

32:58.744 --> 33:02.813
Which doesn't mean
it's not a trap.

33:02.881 --> 33:04.582
Well, we have 72 hours
to figure that out

33:04.650 --> 33:06.384
before we have to meet
with him.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.152
When's the wedding?

33:10.556 --> 33:13.158
Yeah. It's tomorrow.

33:13.225 --> 33:16.194
Not wasting any time.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.030
I wanted a longer engagement.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.364
Martha had other plans.

33:19.432 --> 33:21.933
Mm...

33:22.001 --> 33:23.735
I need you there.

33:25.805 --> 33:30.208
I need a family--
relatives.

33:30.276 --> 33:34.012
Okay.

33:55.101 --> 33:58.236
Excuse me, sir.
Can I see some ID?

33:58.304 --> 34:00.105
Yeah. Yeah.

34:00.173 --> 34:02.475
One second.

34:06.180 --> 34:07.714
Mr. Prince,

34:07.782 --> 34:09.850
turn around and put your hands
on the roof of the car.

34:09.918 --> 34:12.485
Sure.

34:23.467 --> 34:24.850
Prince was arrested.

34:24.879 --> 34:28.313
Shit. Any idea
how the FBI got onto him?

34:28.380 --> 34:29.982
Not FBI--
local police.

34:30.049 --> 34:32.083
Failure to pay child support.

34:34.053 --> 34:34.987
Okay.

34:36.489 --> 34:38.322
How many days before the feds

34:38.389 --> 34:41.592
start looking into an incarcerated
Department Of Defense employee

34:41.659 --> 34:43.527
with a high-level
security clearance

34:43.596 --> 34:45.730
and a felony charge
hanging over his head?

34:45.797 --> 34:49.100
All we need is three days
until you meet with the colonel.

34:49.168 --> 34:51.335
Even if the meeting wasn't
a setup before,

34:51.402 --> 34:54.039
it's insane to go into it now
with Prince in custody.

34:54.106 --> 34:56.041
He could be broken
with a feather duster.

34:56.108 --> 34:58.176
I know you and Philip
radioed the Centre

34:58.244 --> 35:00.212
to confirm
the orders for the meeting.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.781
I also know
they confirmed them for you.

35:02.849 --> 35:05.117
What confuses me
is why you went around me.

35:05.185 --> 35:07.620
Do you really think
I'd make something like this up,

35:07.688 --> 35:09.855
with the security of our nation
at stake?

35:09.923 --> 35:12.124
Is that what you care about--
our nation?

35:12.192 --> 35:14.360
- I hadn't figured that out.
- I do.

35:14.428 --> 35:16.028
And orders
to meet with the colonel

35:16.096 --> 35:17.964
were confirmed, as you know.

35:18.032 --> 35:19.933
That was before
Prince was arrested.

35:20.001 --> 35:21.901
I don't see Moscow
changing their minds.

35:21.969 --> 35:23.904
Martha, Mr. and Mrs. Hanson,

35:23.972 --> 35:27.208
I'd like you to meet my mother,
Alexandra, my sister, Jennifer.

35:27.275 --> 35:28.976
Is it okay if I hug you?

35:29.044 --> 35:32.413
- Oh, welcome to the family, Martha.
- Thank you.

35:32.481 --> 35:35.116
- You're exactly as Clark described.
- Aww.

35:35.184 --> 35:36.751
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

35:36.819 --> 35:38.653
I'm Bill.
Uh, this is my wife, Elaine.

35:38.721 --> 35:40.255
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you as well.

35:40.323 --> 35:41.790
So nice to meet you both.

35:41.857 --> 35:43.992
I can see
the family resemblance.

35:46.028 --> 35:48.563
- That's what people say.
- Yeah. Yeah, they do.

35:48.630 --> 35:50.665
Clark Westerfeld
and Martha Hanson?

35:50.733 --> 35:51.833
Yes.

35:51.901 --> 35:54.403
- You ready?
- Of course.

36:03.546 --> 36:07.816
An oath is both
a statement for the present

36:07.883 --> 36:11.020
and a promise to the future.

36:11.087 --> 36:15.091
It is the means by which
we humans tell each other,

36:15.158 --> 36:18.328
"I'm in this
for the long haul."

36:18.395 --> 36:21.530
Martha Anne Hanson,

36:21.598 --> 36:25.034
do you take this man,
Clark Herbert Westerfeld,

36:25.102 --> 36:27.637
to be your husband and partner,

36:27.704 --> 36:31.140
in good times and bad,
till death do you part?

36:31.208 --> 36:33.809
Yes, I do.

36:33.877 --> 36:35.678
Clark Herbert Westerfeld,

36:35.746 --> 36:38.314
do you take this woman,
Martha Anne Hanson,

36:38.382 --> 36:41.150
to be your wife and partner,

36:41.218 --> 36:44.654
in good times and bad,
till death do you part?

36:44.722 --> 36:46.456
I do.

36:46.523 --> 36:50.860
Please place the ring
on the other's finger.

36:59.236 --> 37:03.573
By the power vested in me
by the State of Virginia,

37:03.641 --> 37:06.576
I pronounce you man and wife.

37:11.815 --> 37:15.084
Oh, mommy!

37:15.152 --> 37:17.353
Oh, daddy.

37:17.420 --> 37:19.154
It was beautiful.

37:19.222 --> 37:21.823
- Welcome to the family.
- Oh, thank you.

37:21.891 --> 37:23.391
Thank you.

37:30.131 --> 37:32.566
Congratulations.

37:34.902 --> 37:37.603
It was touching.

37:37.671 --> 37:38.738
No. It was.

37:38.806 --> 37:41.307
I didn't expect it to be.

37:43.810 --> 37:47.013
You and I were
never really married.

37:49.649 --> 37:51.584
No.

37:51.652 --> 37:52.919
It's funny--

37:52.987 --> 37:55.488
I know they're
just words people say.

37:58.358 --> 38:00.460
Do you think things would've
been different between us

38:00.528 --> 38:03.296
if we would've said them?

38:07.134 --> 38:09.969
I don't know.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.261
This is
a composite of the woman

38:32.328 --> 38:34.229
based on
Patterson's description.

38:34.297 --> 38:37.065
And this is one of the woman

38:37.133 --> 38:40.002
based on
Viola Johnson's description.

38:40.069 --> 38:41.303
Different people.

38:41.371 --> 38:43.472
Not necessarily.

38:43.540 --> 38:47.843
Hair, eyebrows, and noses
all completely different.

38:47.910 --> 38:49.811
The bone structures
are similar.

38:49.879 --> 38:51.779
Both women have cheekbones,
yeah.

38:51.847 --> 38:53.948
Noses, lips, ears.

38:54.016 --> 38:55.750
The differences
are superficial, sir.

38:55.818 --> 38:57.252
So...

38:58.988 --> 39:00.588
this one is based on

39:00.656 --> 39:03.625
Viola Johnson's description
of the man who poisoned her son.

39:03.693 --> 39:06.461
What do we have
from Patterson on this guy?

39:06.529 --> 39:09.965
Patterson never actually got
a look at him.

39:10.032 --> 39:13.769
But we know that we're looking
for a Caucasian man and woman,

39:13.836 --> 39:16.038
in their 30s, perhaps 40s.

39:16.105 --> 39:18.774
I'm not convinced the people
who abducted Richard Patterson

39:18.842 --> 39:21.343
are the same people who poisoned
Viola Johnson's son.

39:21.411 --> 39:22.711
I am.

39:22.779 --> 39:25.314
You say that based on
these drawings?

39:25.382 --> 39:27.149
And my experience in the field.

39:27.217 --> 39:28.384
This is speculation.

39:28.451 --> 39:29.885
Call it what you may.

39:29.952 --> 39:34.189
These people are
the illegals we've been chasing.
