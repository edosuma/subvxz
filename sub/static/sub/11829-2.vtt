00:03.400 --> 00:04.900
You're only young once.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.900
You should be having
a little fun.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.600
You've got something
more exciting than Mark Molina?

00:09.600 --> 00:11.100
I had sex.

00:11.100 --> 00:12.400
You don't think
I could ever forget

00:12.400 --> 00:15.000
the night we spent together
at band camp, do ya?

00:15.000 --> 00:17.300
I'm 15, you're 16.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.800
I think it's gonna
be a while.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.400
We're gonna save what's meant
for marriage for marriage.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.100
You two, you don't...?

00:23.100 --> 00:25.600
You have a right
to be angry.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.600
Your father did steal your childhood
by sexually abusing you.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.800
Jack, yeah,
I know who you are.

00:31.100 --> 00:33.400
The guy that's not having sex
with his girlfriend.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.800
Come on, call her.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.000
I'll call her.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.700
Um, can I talk
to the two of you alone?

00:38.900 --> 00:40.900
For you. It's a guy.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.100
You have a boyfriend?

00:42.100 --> 00:43.300
Is that what you're
trying to tell us?

00:43.900 --> 00:45.000
Kinda my first date.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.500
Yeah, it's, uh,
kinda my first date, too.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.100
Idiots falling in love.

00:49.100 --> 00:49.900
Should we dance?

00:49.900 --> 00:51.200
So, where's your boyfriend?

00:51.400 --> 00:53.000
He just stepped outside
to get some air.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.100
So you gonna tell him...

00:55.000 --> 00:56.100
about us?

00:56.100 --> 00:57.400
Do you want me to?

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.500 --> 01:38.100
Please?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.700
Grace.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.900
OK. Talk to you later.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.100
Yeah. Yeah.

01:57.300 --> 01:58.800
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.300
Anytime.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.500
- OK.
- OK.

02:10.699 --> 02:12.200
I'm such an idiot.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.900
"OK." "OK."

02:13.900 --> 02:16.000
Where were you this weekend?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.100
I was gonna come over,

02:17.100 --> 02:18.900
but I wasn't sure
what was going on.

02:19.000 --> 02:19.900
Did you tell them?

02:19.900 --> 02:20.600
Tell them?

02:20.700 --> 02:23.800
Did you tell your parents
about... you know?

02:24.300 --> 02:25.200
No.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.200
Why not?

02:26.200 --> 02:27.900
Because I figure
I have two options -

02:27.900 --> 02:30.100
One, to tell them and ruin
the rest of my life,

02:30.200 --> 02:32.000
the other, to pretend like
it never happened, 

02:32.000 --> 02:33.600
so I'm going with "never happened."

02:33.600 --> 02:35.900
Well, Amy, unfortunately,
it did happen,

02:35.900 --> 02:37.500
- and you're gonna have to -
- Never happened.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.400
Amy...

02:38.600 --> 02:40.300
Never happened.

02:43.300 --> 02:44.600
People know.

02:44.700 --> 02:50.700
OK, people only know
that Amy had sex with Ricky.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.200
??? what happened
at the party after the game?

03:30.200 --> 03:31.300
Oh, right.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.300
You were there.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.700
Yeah, I was there.

03:33.900 --> 03:34.700
What happened?

03:34.700 --> 03:37.200
Adrian, the majorette, was
supposed to meet me there.

03:37.500 --> 03:41.200
Then I find out she's kissing some
cheerleader's boyfriend in front of everyone.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.200
What cheerleader?

03:42.300 --> 03:43.000
Grace.

03:43.000 --> 03:43.900
Oh, right.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.100
That cheerleader.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.100
Yeah, yeah, I heard.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.200
You know Grace's mom
is my dad's ex-wife?

03:50.200 --> 03:51.200
Oh, no kidding.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.800
You two don't look
anything alike.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.500
It was a joke, like I thought
you were sisters or something.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.600
You're not sisters?

03:58.600 --> 03:59.800
No, we're not related.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.100
Yeah, I get that.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.900
Anyway, I can't believe
that happened.

04:03.900 --> 04:07.000
I mean, not that we were
in a relationship.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.700
We're just friends,
Adrian and me, but still.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.900
Everything's more complicated
than it seems.

04:14.900 --> 04:15.700
Yeah, I guess,

04:15.700 --> 04:18.700
but I'm not exactly the kind of guy
who gets cheated on,

04:18.899 --> 04:19.399
you know?

04:19.399 --> 04:21.500
No. No, I don't know.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.100
So, do you wanna
do something tonight?

04:24.100 --> 04:24.800
Do something?

04:24.800 --> 04:25.700
Don't get excited.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.500
I meant do something,
like go somewhere and talk.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.100
You and I are friends,
too, right?

04:31.100 --> 04:32.900
Actually,
I'm seeing someone.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.300
Who are you seeing?

04:36.100 --> 04:38.200
Is it that little geek
who wants to be me?

04:38.400 --> 04:41.200
Why do that when you could be
out with the real thing?

04:41.600 --> 04:42.900
As a friend, of course.

04:42.900 --> 04:43.900
Of course.

04:43.900 --> 04:46.700
Thank you for offering, Ricky,
but I'm really not interested.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.300
Whoa. Who are you
not to be interested in me?

04:52.300 --> 04:53.600
Rejected again?

04:54.900 --> 04:58.000
Maybe you should consider
going for someone more like yourself.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.500
Oh, sooner or later, you know
you're gonna forgive me, so come on.

05:02.800 --> 05:06.400
Come over tonight
and let me apologize to you in person.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.000
I can't.
I have things to do.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.800
You can't be serious.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.600
You can't be interested
in that child.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.500
You know, some girls do it
without broadcasting it to the whole school.

05:16.500 --> 05:21.100
Some girls are more discreet
about their sex life than you are.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.000
Some girls have class.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.900
And you're referring to that
little French horn player

05:25.900 --> 05:28.500
who looks like she's 12
and has never been kissed?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.200
I don't think
she has a sex life.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.100
She has nothing
to be discreet about.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.500
And I don't know
if she has class.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.400
She's just a band geek.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.300
Wait,
do you know something?

05:39.400 --> 05:40.200
Am I wrong?

05:40.200 --> 05:42.400
Is she not just a band geek?

05:43.300 --> 05:45.300
You cannot pretend like
this isn't happening.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.200
Yes, I can.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.000
It's better than the plan
you two came uwith.

05:48.000 --> 05:48.900
Here he comes.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.000
Maybe you should
just tell him.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.700
You guys can tell
your parents together.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.200
No, don't even think
about doing that.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.000
Just talk
to your parents first.

05:56.000 --> 05:56.900
Yeah.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.000
Bye, girls. I wanna talk
to your friend alone.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.100
You havin' some sort
of memory problem?

06:08.100 --> 06:09.800
Can't remember
the locker combination?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.900
Can't remember what happened
just six weeks,

06:11.900 --> 06:13.100
a couple of months ago?

06:13.100 --> 06:14.300
Nothing happened.

06:14.300 --> 06:18.800
OK, it wasn't that great,
but you were a little nervous,

06:18.800 --> 06:20.200
and that's understandable.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.800
It'll get better. It's OK.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.200
I told you,
I'm seeing someone.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.100
Grace, are you OK?

06:36.100 --> 06:37.700
I just don't feel that well.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.000
You were fine this morning.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.300
No, I wasn't fine.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.700
I thought I could get
through this, but I can't.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.400
I feel completely humiliated.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.800
Please, Mom, please,
can you just take me home?

06:48.800 --> 06:50.000
Don't you have a test today?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Algebra.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.700
It was first period.
I aced it.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.000
I'm sure you did.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.500
Because you are
a very smart young woman.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.400
Maybe with schoolwork.

06:58.700 --> 07:01.500
I'm not that smart
when it comes to men,obviously.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.600
Grace...

07:04.400 --> 07:06.500
I know that you're
smart enough to realize

07:06.500 --> 07:08.700
that Jack not
the guy for you.

07:08.700 --> 07:09.300
No, I'm not.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.100
That's just the thing.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.300
I still love him,
and I hate her.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.300
I know I'm not supposed
to hate anyone, but I hate her.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.400
You know...

07:16.800 --> 07:19.400
a lot of women react
to men cheating like that.

07:19.500 --> 07:23.000
The guy cheats, and instead
of blaming him, they blame her.

07:23.100 --> 07:24.900
They forgive him
and never her.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.300
Her after her after her.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.300
Well, he didn't cheat
on me, exactly.

07:29.300 --> 07:32.000
He just kissed her
in front of the whole school.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.500
Or let her kiss him.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.400
I mean, what guy wouldn't?
You've seen her.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.500
Grace...

07:37.500 --> 07:42.200
Maybe it's not his fault,
and maybe it's not even her fault.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.600
Maybe it's my fault.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.400
Because you won't
have sex with him?

07:47.100 --> 07:50.000
I mean, do you think that gives him
reason to kiss someone else?

07:56.400 --> 07:58.700
Hey, man, I only scored 80
on my paper you wrote.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.300
I know.

07:59.300 --> 07:59.900
So?

07:59.900 --> 08:01.700
I took your abilities
into account

08:02.100 --> 08:04.100
and decided to dumb down
the essay a little.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.300
I'm lookin'
for believability here, man,

08:06.300 --> 08:07.900
or else I'm out of business.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.300
80's a high score
for you.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.900
Great. Thanks, man.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
Idiot.

08:15.900 --> 08:18.400
Do you think they were doing
anything more than kissing?

08:18.400 --> 08:21.100
The point is Jack is not
good enough for you.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.900
He can't be trusted, OK?

08:28.600 --> 08:31.400
Hey. I heard you were sick.
Are you OK?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.100
You gonna go home?

08:35.600 --> 08:36.700
Hi, Mrs. Bowman.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.799
She's just fine, Jack.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.799
We forgot
about a dental appointment.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.700
You know, just a little
teeth cleaning?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.300
You know how important it is
to have clean teeth.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.300
We should go.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.500
Yeah, I gotta go, too.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.200
Can you believe that?

08:56.200 --> 09:00.000
Yes, honey, actually, I can,
because he's a careless guy,

09:00.700 --> 09:05.200
and you don't need
a careless guy, OK?

09:05.200 --> 09:06.600
Let's go get
a cup of coffee,

09:06.600 --> 09:08.600
and then I'll bring you back
for cheer practice.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.600
What did you tell the nurse
was wrong with you?

09:11.600 --> 09:13.000
I didn't have to
tell her anything.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.300
Everyone just heard,
even her.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.600
So Iust sa
I wanted to go home.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.500
OK.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.000
He is kind of careless.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Kind of?

09:22.200 --> 09:25.300
Now just rember, honey,
you should neither judge him

09:25.300 --> 09:27.700
nor feel sorry for him, 'K?

09:27.700 --> 09:29.100
Just let this one go.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.200
Let's go.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.500
Advertising?

09:40.500 --> 09:41.400
What?

09:43.300 --> 09:44.300
Oh, Lord.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.800
I don't know what the Lord
has to do with your zipper,

09:46.800 --> 09:48.700
but you're welcome.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.300
Hey, wait up.

09:54.900 --> 09:55.800
Where's your girlfriend?

09:55.800 --> 09:57.800
I don't have a girlfriend,
not yet, anyway.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.900
Maybe if you wanted
to apologize...

09:59.900 --> 10:00.900
I thought about it,

10:00.900 --> 10:03.800
but I really don't owe you
an apology for anything.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.200
You know, since we're not
even gng out or anything.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.600
We're just friends.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.900
I can do anything I want.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.000
Still, you offered
to apologize.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.800
It was a one-time-only offer.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.900
You shouldn't have
stood me up.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.600
So were you with that Amy girl,
the one in the band?

10:18.600 --> 10:20.200
I didn't stand you up,
you stood me up.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.500
Or you were late, anyway,
and, no, I was not with Amy.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.400
I was only with her
the one time.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.300
I don't believe you.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.700
I'm telling you the truth.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.000
So where were you that night?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I was not with Amy.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.100
What are you, my wife?
I answer to you now?

10:32.300 --> 10:33.900
I was at home
with my foster parents.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.500
I couldn't get
out of the house.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.800
Foster parents are twice as tough
as real parents.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.100
Believe me, I know.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.600
I've bounced from one
foster home to another.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.300
Jack probably thinks
he's going to hell now.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.100
Yeah, well, it's not like I made Jack
do something he didn't wanna do.

10:50.100 --> 10:53.300
No, it's like - it's like
you took advantage of him.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.500
What went on with you two
before that kiss?

10:55.600 --> 10:56.300
Something.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.700
What, I answer to you now?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.200
He told the guys
in the locker room,

10:59.200 --> 11:00.700
they told their girlfriends.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.000
One of them
already told me.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.900
I don't really care.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.800
What kind of guy brags
about this stuff?

11:05.800 --> 11:08.200
Uh, you told me
about Amy Juergens.

11:09.700 --> 11:10.700
Yeah?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.600
Nice touch -
the gloves.

11:21.700 --> 11:22.900
He has pinkeye.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.800
Your butler
insisted on it.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.700
And if he didn't insist?

11:27.700 --> 11:29.100
We'd all have pinkeye.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.400
I see.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.600
Anyway, so...

11:32.900 --> 11:34.400
you take the sour cream
and onion chip,

11:34.400 --> 11:36.300
you dip it in the plain sour cream, 

11:36.300 --> 11:37.700
and it tastes
just like onion dip.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.100
It's delicious. Try it.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.900
I think it's just
that chips and dip taste better

11:45.900 --> 11:47.500
when they're served
out of silver bowls.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.400
I've never had a chip
that wasn't straight out of the bag.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.400
My dad thinks we should use all
the silver stuff we have, 

11:52.400 --> 11:53.900
even if we don't know
what it's for.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.600
I agree with your dad.
We should.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.500
Don't do that.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.300
I'll smack you.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.100
Oh, he's just reminding you
that we haven't used

12:01.100 --> 12:02.800
any of the china
or silver or anything

12:02.800 --> 12:04.000
since my mom died.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.400
Yeah, I know that. Henry.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.300
I thought that maybe
you forgot.

12:08.800 --> 12:09.700
It's healthy.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.300
It's healthy to move on, Ben.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.700
It's been a long time.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.400
Five years is a long time.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.200
Yeah. It is.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.500
Believe me, it feels longer
than five years.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.400
Time passes real slow
when you're a kid.

12:22.300 --> 12:23.900
It's starting to speed up
a little, though.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.600
Guess I'm getting older,
maturing.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.900
Maybe I'll
get married soon,

12:28.900 --> 12:31.500
have a kid,
start a little family band.

12:33.800 --> 12:34.700
What?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.700
I think you're too young
to be having those thoughts.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.700
You can't just fall in love
with the first girl you go out with

12:41.700 --> 12:42.700
and marry her.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.700
And have a family band
with her?

12:44.700 --> 12:46.600
Why not? Isn't that
what you're supposed to do?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.100
More than half of all marriages
end in divorce.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.500
The younger you are
when you get married, 

12:50.500 --> 12:52.400
the more likely you are to get divorced.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.900
My dad married the first girl
he ever dated. They were 18.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.400
That's different.
That was in the '80s.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.000
Everyone was coked out
and disco dancing.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.300
No one really knew
what they were doing.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.100
My parents never did coke.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.400
Disco, yeah.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.700
Regardless, my point is,
you should see other girls.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.600
I just started
seeing this one,

13:09.600 --> 13:11.200
the one that you
picked out for me.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.200
She's perfect.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.000
I love her.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.200
Something's going on.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.100
What's going on?

13:19.200 --> 13:20.400
All right, look,
I'm a straight shooter,

13:20.400 --> 13:22.200
so... let me just tell you.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.400
You've got competion.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.300
Ha. What,
that total loser Ricky?

13:26.300 --> 13:27.600
Tricky Ricky?

13:27.700 --> 13:28.700
He's no competition.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.000
They slept together.

13:30.700 --> 13:31.700
What?

13:33.500 --> 13:35.800
What - no -
My little Amy would never -

13:37.200 --> 13:40.000
Wait, she slept with him?

13:40.400 --> 13:43.000
Slept, as in had sex?

13:43.100 --> 13:44.400
That's what I heard.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
I don't care.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.400
Yeah, you do. I know you.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.300
You don't know me
if you think that would stop me

13:52.300 --> 13:54.700
from marrying my Amy
and starting a band with her.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.300
Who told you this?

13:56.300 --> 13:57.400
It's all over school.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.800
Oh, and that
makes it true?

14:00.100 --> 14:02.100
What percentage
of gossip is true?

14:02.100 --> 14:03.100
I don't know.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.700
Well, I know it's not 100%.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.200
That guy, Ricky,is probably telling people
he slept with her

14:07.200 --> 14:08.500
hoping it'd get back to me.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.800
He's totally jealous of me.

14:09.800 --> 14:13.400
OK. Well, maybe there's
a reason he's jealous of you.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.000
Like maybe
they did sleep together?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.200
At band camp.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.500
Now you've got details?

14:17.500 --> 14:18.600
That's everything
I know.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.000
I'm gonna call her
and ask her.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.400
Not a bad idea.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.000
You two are idiots.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.400
I bet it's just a rumor.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.500
I bet it's not.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.500
I hope I'm wrong. 20?

14:29.800 --> 14:30.800
You're on.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.400
Hey! How are ya?

14:36.800 --> 14:38.800
Um, I'm fine.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.200
You sure?

14:40.500 --> 14:41.700
Yeah, I'm sure.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.900
I hope you know
what you're doin'.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.800
Am I doing
something wrong

14:45.800 --> 14:46.800
in band practice?

14:46.800 --> 14:48.000
Did I get in your way
or something?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.600
No, you didn't get in my way.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.600
Look, if you're interested
in Ricky, 

14:52.600 --> 14:54.800
I won't go out with him.
I'll back off.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.800
You know, I'm really not into
stealing anyone's boyfriend.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.700
I wasn't interested
in taking Jack away from Grace.

15:00.700 --> 15:01.700
He came to me.

15:01.700 --> 15:05.300
I'm no-no-no-
I'm not interested in Ricky.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.100
All right.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.000
That's not what I heard, but...

15:08.200 --> 15:09.800
No, I heard that you were...

15:10.200 --> 15:12.900
interested in him
before I was, so...

15:12.900 --> 15:13.800
No.

15:23.500 --> 15:26.200
Hi. Amy, it's me - Ben.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.600
Hi.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.100
Oh, I already said that.

15:30.300 --> 15:33.200
Um, anyway, uh,
I was wondering...

15:34.900 --> 15:37.300
There's this rumor
going around school

15:37.300 --> 15:42.700
that, uh, you and Ricky dated
this summer or something.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.700
Uh, not that it makes
any difference.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.900
I- I was just wondering.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.000
Is that true?

15:50.800 --> 15:51.600
OK, you know what?

15:51.600 --> 15:53.800
I have no way of
calling back this message,

15:53.800 --> 15:55.800
which I wish I'd never sent.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.400
It doesn't matter.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.100
I don't care.

15:59.900 --> 16:02.500
And it's none of my business,
none of my business at all.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.700
It's your business.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.000
And our business started
the day that we met.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.100
OK. Talk to you later.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.500
I hope.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.000
If I don't hear back from you,
I'll call again,

16:15.300 --> 16:18.800
and i-if you don't answer,
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

16:19.700 --> 16:20.600
OK.

16:21.200 --> 16:25.600
Uh, and again,
I- I don't even know why I asked.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.200
OK. Bye.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.300
Oh, call me.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.300
Please?

16:35.400 --> 16:36.200
You were right.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.000
This was a really bad idea.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.400
We have to go now.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.300
Idiot.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.100
At least I didn't say
she slept with him.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.200
I said she dated him.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.500
At least.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.800
Let's go already.

17:05.900 --> 17:06.700
Hi.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.400
Amy, it's me - Ben.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.599
Hi. Oh, I already said that.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.400
Um, anyway,
uh, I was wondering,

17:13.800 --> 17:15.800
there's this rumor
going around school

17:15.800 --> 17:17.900
that you and Ricky...

17:17.900 --> 17:19.200
Never happened!

17:26.400 --> 17:27.900
Hey. Hey, watch it.

17:27.900 --> 17:28.400
That's my livelihood.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.200
Are you telling people
that we did something?

17:30.200 --> 17:31.800
What? What's goin' on?

17:31.800 --> 17:32.600
Are you?

17:32.600 --> 17:34.700
Something? Am I telling people
we did something?

17:34.900 --> 17:36.200
No, I'm not.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.900
Are you telling people
we did something?

17:37.900 --> 17:38.800
No.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.500
Really?

17:39.600 --> 17:41.300
You didn't tell
your two girlfriends,

17:41.300 --> 17:43.300
and your two girlfriends
didn't tell anyone?

18:13.400 --> 18:16.100
Madison says she's been
trying to call you on your cell phone.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.700
I'm trying to study.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.000
Don't just barge in
to my room like that, OK?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.500
I have the right to privacy.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.300
Man, you're such a dork.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.600
And what do you need
all the privacy for, anyway?

18:27.500 --> 18:31.300
I mean, what, are you writing little secret
love poems to your boyfriend or something?

18:34.300 --> 18:34.900
Hello?

18:37.500 --> 18:39.400
It's the other one,
the snob.

18:43.300 --> 18:44.600
I can't talk.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.500
M- My parents
are making me study.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.400
Just stop c-calling me.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.600
Well, what is this?

18:55.600 --> 18:56.700
You're lying?

18:57.300 --> 18:58.100
You don't lie.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.100
You never lie.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.100
When you do,
your face turns bright red,

19:01.100 --> 19:03.300
you get little beads
of sweat on your forehead,

19:03.700 --> 19:06.200
and if it's a really big lie,
you start stuttering again.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.400
So... you're lying.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.900
Why would you be lying
to your two BFFs, anyway?

19:14.900 --> 19:17.800
I'm just t-trying
study, OK?

19:17.800 --> 19:18.800
Yeah, OK.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.900
Hey, whatever happened
to that Ben guy?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.100
Oh, wait,
is the fight about Ben?

19:28.800 --> 19:30.800
What, are they, like,
jealous or something?

19:30.900 --> 19:33.200
It's not about anything,
all right?

19:33.200 --> 19:36.000
We're not even having a fight,
and I'm not stuttering.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.300
You're sweating.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.300
B- Bye.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.500
Hey, hey, hey,
what do you think, hon?

19:56.400 --> 19:57.600
This is a recliner.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.400
Rocks, reclines.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.700
Put some wheels on it.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.500
Now it goes back and forth.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.900
I think I invented something.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.200
Is that why you're late?

20:07.600 --> 20:09.100
no. I, um,

20:09.300 --> 20:10.100
was gonna close at six,

20:10.100 --> 20:11.300
but a couple of chicks
came into the store.

20:11.300 --> 20:12.300
I couldn't get rid of 'em.

20:12.300 --> 20:13.300
They just bought a house.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.600
In this market? So you know
they got plenty of dough.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.000
Do we?

20:18.400 --> 20:19.300
Do we what?

20:19.900 --> 20:21.000
Have plenty of dough?

20:21.000 --> 20:21.800
Why?

20:22.100 --> 20:23.200
I was just wondering.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.300
Don't wonder.
It's a waste of time.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.800
I think worry is a waste of time.

20:28.800 --> 20:29.900
I don't know about wonder.

20:29.900 --> 20:31.000
You may be right.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.500
I wonder if there's something
for me to eat in here.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.700
George, I want to
go to see our accountant.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.700
I want to make sure
we have enough put away??

20:36.700 --> 20:38.700
for Amy and Ashley
to go to college.

20:38.900 --> 20:41.400
Ashley? We'll be lucky
if she goes to high school.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.100
Is that an option?

20:45.100 --> 20:46.300
I don't have to go to high school?

20:46.300 --> 20:48.100
Of course you have to
go to high school.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.500
And college.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.500
Why don't you
go make that sandwich?

20:53.800 --> 20:55.900
And get that hybrid
out of here, please.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.700
You're worried about money,
and I'm wheelin' out our nest egg.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.300
Lotta phone calls tonight.

21:03.900 --> 21:04.700
Yeah?

21:05.400 --> 21:06.700
What about home schooling?

21:06.700 --> 21:07.900
Sure.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.500
Just you and me and a bunch of
schoolbooks for eight hours.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.900
Every day. For four years.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.000
Maybe I could go to school in Europe?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.700
Yeah, let's see how well
that chair does.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.200
So, the phone calls.

21:19.300 --> 21:21.500
Everything OK with Amy,
Madison and Lauren?

21:21.500 --> 21:22.400
I don't know.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.600
Was everything OK
with Larry, Curly and Moe?

21:39.100 --> 21:40.500
Yeah! Just -

21:40.500 --> 21:41.700
Hi, Dr. Bowman.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.900
I was wondering
if I might speak with Grace?

21:47.500 --> 21:49.800
Speak with Grace
about what, exactly?

21:49.800 --> 21:51.400
I just wanna talk to her.

21:51.600 --> 21:52.400
Yeah.

21:52.700 --> 21:54.000
You called her cell phone,
you called the house,

21:54.000 --> 21:55.900
you even resorted
to calling her brother.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.500
She doesn't wanna talk to you, Jack.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.200
Why don't you buy a vowel,
go home?

21:59.600 --> 22:01.100
I have to talk to her.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.300
I can't not talk to her.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.300
I... I love her.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.300
I made a mistake,
but I do love her.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.200
Didn't you ever make a mistake?

22:10.200 --> 22:11.600
Excuse me?

22:11.900 --> 22:13.500
Look, I promise,
it won't happen again.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.000
Oh, no, no, Jack,
I think it will happen again.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.200
It was just a kiss.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.200
Really?

22:19.200 --> 22:20.600
- ??
- ??My wife seems to think that,

22:20.600 --> 22:21.700
and my daughter seems to think that,

22:21.700 --> 22:25.000
but I'm not buying it, Jack.??

22:25.000 --> 22:26.900
Aren't we all Christians here?

22:27.100 --> 22:28.000
Aren't you supposed to forgive?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.300
??All I'm askin' for
is a little forgiveness.

22:30.300 --> 22:31.300
All right,

22:31.800 --> 22:35.800
and exactly what will you be asking for
after you get your forgiveness, Jack?

22:37.800 --> 22:38.900
Look,

22:39.200 --> 22:42.000
do yourself a very big favor, OK?

22:42.100 --> 22:44.700
Go home before I pummel you.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.700
I thought you were a Christian.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.100
That's right, I'm a Christian,

22:48.100 --> 22:49.900
so first, I will smite you,

22:49.900 --> 22:51.300
then I will pummel you.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.400
Go home.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.500
Smite?

23:00.400 --> 23:01.600
I heard that.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.600
Was that Jack?

23:10.900 --> 23:12.400
- Yeah.
- What did he want?

23:12.400 --> 23:13.800
??He said he wanted forgiveness...

23:13.800 --> 23:16.700
but I have a feeling
what he really wanted was you.

23:16.700 --> 23:17.600
Really?

23:17.600 --> 23:20.800
Yes, really, and I'm not
saying that in a good way, Gracie.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.200
Is that why you gave me
this ring, you and Mom,

23:25.200 --> 23:26.600
because you don't trust me?

23:26.600 --> 23:28.900
No. Sweetheart, we trust you.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.900
??We don't trust Jack or any
other boy you might wanna date.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.300
Because?

23:33.800 --> 23:36.700
Because they're teenage guys
in high school.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.000
??Teenage guys in high school are
only interested in one thing, sweetheart,

23:40.000 --> 23:41.100
and that's sex.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.300
I think that's unfair.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.400
- OK.
- OK, what?

23:45.900 --> 23:49.900
It's OK that you think my assessment
of the situation is unfair.

23:49.900 --> 23:53.300
I think I know a little bit more
about this than you do, but -??

23:53.300 --> 23:55.500
Then again, you think you know
more about everything??

23:55.500 --> 23:56.700
??because you're a doctor.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.500
Yes, I am a doctor

23:58.500 --> 24:01.200
??who happened to once be
a teenage boy in high school,

24:01.200 --> 24:03.700
so, yeah, I do think I know
a little more about this than you.

24:03.700 --> 24:06.700
??Listen, I realize you're upset,

24:06.900 --> 24:09.000
but do not talk to me that way.

24:10.300 --> 24:13.800
I think it would be wise of you
to stay away from Jack altogether.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.400
And if I don't wanna
stay away from Jack?

24:15.400 --> 24:17.900
I suppose your mother and I
will have to re-evaluate

24:17.900 --> 24:21.200
whether or not we think you're old
enough to make your own decisions.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.000
I'm almost 16, Dad.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.300
I know that you're
almost 16 years old.

24:25.300 --> 24:26.600
I was there.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.200
I'm older than you. I'm always
gonna be older than you.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.700
??Because of that, I'm gonna know
a little bit more than you,

24:33.700 --> 24:35.000
whether you're 16 or 60.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.700
That's just how it works.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.300
I'm at a loss here.

24:39.300 --> 24:42.200
I can't figure out why in the world
you would even wanna see Jack again,

24:42.200 --> 24:46.300
especially considering the pain and
suffering he put you through this week.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.400
I think you ought to go upstairs
and think about that.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.100
And while you're at it,

24:50.100 --> 24:52.300
think about why in the world
you would wanna put yourself

24:52.300 --> 24:54.900
through any more
public humiliation at school.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.000
Then you and I can talk about it,

24:57.700 --> 24:59.400
tomorrow,
but please...

24:59.500 --> 25:02.700
don't put me in the position
to have to make up your mind for you

25:02.700 --> 25:05.800
simply because you don't
think enough of yourself.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.900
Sweetheart, do you know the number
one killer of women young and old???

25:10.900 --> 25:12.500
That HPV thing?

25:12.500 --> 25:14.400
No, it's not that HPV thing.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.600
It's low self-esteem.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.400
??And those teenage boys
out there know that,

25:19.400 --> 25:21.900
and they use it against you
and for them,

25:21.900 --> 25:24.200
so you, you, just - you...

25:24.400 --> 25:26.200
you beware, young lady.

25:32.100 --> 25:33.000
Grace,

25:34.400 --> 25:36.900
I think in all of that
parental wisdom,

25:36.900 --> 25:39.500
I might've forgotten to tell you
how much I love you.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.700
I love you so much.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.300
Good night.

25:44.300 --> 25:46.300
??I love you, too.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.800
But I love Jack, too.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.000
You don't have to go.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.800
My mom's not coming home.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
She's a flight attendant,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.100
so she's in, like,
Denver or somewhere.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.000
Fosters, rember???

26:10.500 --> 26:12.600
I have to go.
It's a law or something.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.800
But that was great.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.300
Well, do you want some pizza
or something?

26:23.300 --> 26:25.100
No. Thanks, anyway.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.500
come on. Can't you
just stay a little while?

26:27.500 --> 26:31.400
I can't. Really, I'm gonna have to
explain where I was, as it is.

26:31.900 --> 26:34.000
You're beautiful. You know that?

26:34.700 --> 26:36.400
I'll call you later, OK?

26:37.300 --> 26:38.500
Yeah, if you want.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.900
If I want? Of course I want.

26:41.800 --> 26:42.900
Good night.

26:43.600 --> 26:46.300
Please. Please stay.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.200
I hate being here by myself.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.700
I can't.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.700
I'd like to, but I can't. I'm sorry.

26:52.700 --> 26:54.600
- All right, go.
- Don't do that.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.600
Don't make me feel bad for doing
what I'm supposed to do.

26:58.100 --> 26:58.700
If I don't go home,

26:58.700 --> 27:00.800
my fosters will report me
to social services,

27:00.800 --> 27:03.000
and I'll be kicked back
into the system.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.300
I'll have to change schools,

27:04.300 --> 27:06.500
and we'll never
see each other again,

27:06.700 --> 27:08.900
because I'll be in juvie
or something.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.400
Is that true?

27:10.400 --> 27:11.800
Yes, it's true.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.300
OK, but call me.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.000
We can talk on the phone
all night.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.200
Yeah, I'll call ya.
Of course I'll call ya.

27:21.800 --> 27:22.700
Bye.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.200
Bye.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.400
Hello.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.300
Hi.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.400
Hi.

27:49.400 --> 27:52.700
I left you a message before.
Just ignore it.

27:54.700 --> 27:56.300
So...

27:56.900 --> 27:58.300
what are you doing this weekend?

27:58.500 --> 28:00.900
Do you wanna go to the museum
on Saturday?

28:00.900 --> 28:03.900
They're have a showing of
the History of Musical Instruments.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.700
I bet my cymbals beat your French
horn on the timeline, huh?

28:06.700 --> 28:08.100
Where did you hear that?

28:08.300 --> 28:09.500
Am I wrong?

28:09.600 --> 28:11.700
The cymbals came
after the French horn?

28:11.700 --> 28:14.300
No. Who told you I had
anything to do with that creep?

28:14.400 --> 28:15.900
What? Oh, no one.

28:15.900 --> 28:18.000
OK, someone had to have told you.

28:19.300 --> 28:21.300
Is it all around school
or something?

28:21.300 --> 28:26.000
No. Someone had just pointed out
to me that maybe this guy -

28:26.100 --> 28:29.300
Mickey, Dickie, Ricky,
whatever -

28:29.300 --> 28:31.200
was jealous for a reason.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.400
A reason like
I did something with him?

28:33.400 --> 28:35.200
What? No. Ah.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.100
I didn't say that.
I said dated.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.100
Please, please,
let's just forget it.

28:41.300 --> 28:42.800
I don't care,
whatever it is.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.400
I mean, I care about you,

28:45.400 --> 28:48.300
so whatever you did
or didn't do,

28:48.300 --> 28:49.400
it doesn't matter,

28:49.400 --> 28:51.600
because you're Amy Juergens,

28:52.400 --> 28:53.800
the girl that I love.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.900
we had one date.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.400
One date and
a thousand phone calls.

29:00.800 --> 29:04.000
And sure, maybe it's a little early
for me to proclaim my love for you,

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
but I plead special circumstances.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.800
OK, well...

29:13.200 --> 29:15.600
don't feel obligated
to reciprocate.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.700
It's totally not necessary.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.700
OK.

29:22.300 --> 29:23.500
I love you, too.

29:24.100 --> 29:26.100
- You do?
- Yeah.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.700
That's great, you know.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.600
Now we can start saying it
all the time.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.500
Well, maybe not all the time,

29:34.500 --> 29:36.600
but we can say it
when we hang up,

29:36.700 --> 29:39.600
you know, like grownups,
like a real couple.

29:41.800 --> 29:42.900
good night, Amy.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.700
I love you.

29:45.400 --> 29:46.500
Good night, Ben.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.100
I love you, too.

30:27.900 --> 30:29.000
good morning, Counselor.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.500
Get outta my chair.

30:30.900 --> 30:31.900
Oh, sorry.

30:31.900 --> 30:33.100
I just grew tired of waiting

30:33.100 --> 30:35.000
and thought perhaps I could
get a different perspective

30:35.000 --> 30:36.800
if I looked at things
from your side.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.500
Yeah, move.

30:44.100 --> 30:46.500
Don't you recognize a cry
for help when you see one?

30:46.700 --> 30:48.000
It's 7:30 in the morning.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I haven't had my first
cup of coffee yet.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.900
I don't recognize anyone
or anything.

30:51.900 --> 30:53.100
What kind of guy
doesn't stop in

30:53.100 --> 30:55.200
for a nonfat soy latte
on his way to work?

30:55.200 --> 30:58.000
Kind of guy that refuses to
spend five bucks on a cup of coffee

30:58.000 --> 31:00.100
when he's trying to
survive off a teacher's salary.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.900
May I suggest buying a coffee pot?

31:01.900 --> 31:03.600
Oh, perhaps a French press.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.800
May I suggest you tell me
what help you need

31:05.800 --> 31:07.500
so I can go down
to the teachers' lounge,

31:07.500 --> 31:10.300
grab a free cup of coffee
I don't have to make myself?

31:10.300 --> 31:13.100
Oh, sure. Or I could wait,
if you wanna run down there.

31:13.100 --> 31:16.100
Tempting, but then I'd be
leaving you in here alone.

31:16.700 --> 31:17.900
Come on, what is it?

31:17.900 --> 31:19.500
What's the problem, music man?

31:21.900 --> 31:23.500
I think you know what
my problem is.

31:23.500 --> 31:24.700
Maybe.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.700
People are talking about my woman.

31:26.900 --> 31:31.300
They're saying she was cavorting with the
drummer at band camp one summer's eve.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.500
I heard that,

31:34.000 --> 31:34.900
but I doubt it.

31:34.900 --> 31:36.900
Yeah, me too, so I asked her.

31:36.900 --> 31:37.900
What did you do that for?

31:37.900 --> 31:38.900
I don't know.

31:38.900 --> 31:40.200
I thought she'd deny it.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.600
She didn't deny it.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.900
Not exactly.

31:42.900 --> 31:45.100
??She probably didn't feel
it deserved a denial.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.900
I felt so horrible about asking her
that I told her I love her.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.900
It's a little early for that,
don't you think?

31:49.900 --> 31:50.800
Yeah.

31:53.300 --> 31:54.200
No.

31:55.100 --> 31:58.100
I do love her, I think.

31:58.400 --> 32:03.600
It just bothers me a teeny-tiny
little bit that maybe, just maybe,

32:03.700 --> 32:06.600
there was a possibility that
something might've happened

32:06.600 --> 32:09.000
between her and this Ricky guy.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.300
OK, here's the thing -

32:11.100 --> 32:12.700
and this is way
outside the realm of things

32:12.700 --> 32:15.400
we're supposed to be talking about
as counselor and student -

32:16.800 --> 32:21.800
but whatever a woman does before she
meets you is none of your business.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.800
Yeah, I know.
I even told her that.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.700
But then I thought,

32:25.700 --> 32:28.600
"If she had killed someone,
I'd wanna know about it."??

32:28.600 --> 32:30.300
She didn't kill anyone.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.400
I wish she had killed someone.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.900
That I would admire, if it was
someone horrible, like Hitler.

32:35.900 --> 32:38.800
She didn't kill Hitler
or anyone like Hitler.

32:38.800 --> 32:39.800
Your point being?

32:39.800 --> 32:43.000
My point being that you can
only deal with what is.

32:43.300 --> 32:45.900
And what is is that
you love this girl,

32:46.400 --> 32:48.900
and you don't know for sure
that she slept with Ricky,

32:48.900 --> 32:50.000
and even if she did,

32:50.000 --> 32:51.900
she probably feels shame
and embarrassment

32:51.900 --> 32:53.600
and wishes she never had,

32:54.100 --> 32:56.700
because now she's found somebody
that actually cares about her.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.700
Yeah.

33:01.700 --> 33:04.700
See, I knew you'd know
just what to say.

33:05.100 --> 33:06.000
Thank you.

33:07.700 --> 33:09.500
Hey, and all that
without the caffeine.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.000
Maybe you oughta kick
that addiction.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
I don't believe in addiction.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.800
I believe in willpower,
plain old-fashioned willpower.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.000
If I wanted to give it up,
I'd give it up.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.500
I don't wanna give it up.

33:18.500 --> 33:19.500
Interesting.

33:19.500 --> 33:21.400
I'm sure. See ya.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.800
Thanks. I owe you.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.300
Amy?

33:43.300 --> 33:44.600
Leave me alone.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.100
We're your best friends.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.500
??Were your parents
really making you study,

33:49.500 --> 33:51.800
or did you have, like,
a fight or something?

33:56.800 --> 33:58.400
I didn't wanna talk to you.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.500
Well, that's rude.

34:00.500 --> 34:01.600
Why not?

34:02.300 --> 34:04.700
What, just telling the whole school
I had sex with Ricky?

34:06.400 --> 34:07.500
- No.
- No.

34:07.500 --> 34:08.800
??He says you did.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.900
Ricky says we told people
the two of you had sex?

34:13.699 --> 34:15.900
??That's ridiculous.
Why would we do that?

34:15.900 --> 34:18.300
??Why would we want people
to know that?

34:18.600 --> 34:20.300
I mean, that's insane.

34:20.300 --> 34:22.100
I mean, who gossips about...

34:22.400 --> 34:23.900
sex?

34:24.800 --> 34:27.500
Ricky told you that we were
telling people that?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.500
Wait. Were you puking in there?

34:33.600 --> 34:35.600
Yeah, that's what he implied.

34:36.100 --> 34:38.300
He is so disgusting.

34:38.400 --> 34:41.500
You know, I hate it
when people blame...

34:41.699 --> 34:43.199
other people for...

34:43.199 --> 34:46.400
for other things and try
and tear friends apart.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.900
Yeah, I mean,

34:48.199 --> 34:51.600
it was probably him who was
saying that you two had sex.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.100
I mean, you know how he is.

34:53.100 --> 34:58.500
He wants everyone to think
he's, like, the big sex... guy.

35:00.100 --> 35:01.700
And he's just a big liar.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.600
So you guys didn't say anything?

35:03.800 --> 35:06.500
I think you know us
a little better than that.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.500
I'm sorry.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.900
You're right, I don't know
what I was thinking.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.800
You guys are my best friends, and...

35:13.100 --> 35:15.700
he's totally the type of guy
that would do something like that.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.500
You know, he better stop.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.300
He better stop right now or...

35:19.500 --> 35:22.500
or my boyfriend's
gonna have a word with him.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.500
Boyfriend? Ben's officially
your boyfriend now?

35:25.500 --> 35:28.200
Yeah. Heh-heh. Last night,
he told me that he loves me.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.400
Really?

35:30.200 --> 35:31.400
Great.

35:31.400 --> 35:36.000
Anyways, gotta get this back to the
band room and then go find Ben.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.400
Bye.

35:39.600 --> 35:43.100
OK, you didn't say anything to
anyone about her and Ricky, did you?

35:43.700 --> 35:46.300
I mean, other than
Ben's best friends.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.400
Wait.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.800
OK, that was me.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.300
But you didn't say anything
to anyone else, right?

35:53.400 --> 35:55.500
No. Did you...

35:55.500 --> 35:56.400
Well...

35:57.400 --> 35:58.800
not about the baby.

35:58.800 --> 35:59.900
Neither did I.

36:01.500 --> 36:02.900
Yeah, OK.

36:02.900 --> 36:03.600
Yeah.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.100
Hey, you,

36:08.400 --> 36:10.400
I can't believe you told him.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.400
I didn't tell him anything.

36:12.800 --> 36:16.000
Like you wouldn't tell Amy if you
knew something about Ben like that.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.100
Well, do you know anything
about Ben like that?

36:18.100 --> 36:19.600
Oh, like Ben got laid?

36:19.600 --> 36:21.300
It doesn't make any difference, OK.

36:21.300 --> 36:22.200
Ben apparently doesn't care

36:22.200 --> 36:24.500
if Amy had some one-night fling
with the drummer boy.

36:24.500 --> 36:25.500
He's above all that.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.100
As long as it wasn't
more than that.

36:27.100 --> 36:28.900
It wasn't more than that.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.400
You think it was more than that?

36:34.400 --> 36:36.100
What could be more than that?

36:36.400 --> 36:39.300
And if it was more than that,
we don't wanna know,

36:39.400 --> 36:41.600
and we don't want Ben to know.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.500
Right. Ignorance is bliss.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.500
Sorry.

37:09.500 --> 37:10.600
By the time
I got home last night,

37:10.600 --> 37:12.400
my battery was dead
on my cell phone.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.500
Yeah?

37:13.600 --> 37:14.900
And my dog ate my homework.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.600
Oh, come on.
You're not mad at me.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.200
Yeah, I am mad at you.

37:18.700 --> 37:19.900
Made you lunch.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.600
You made me lunch?

37:24.600 --> 37:27.000
??A sandwich. A piece of ham
between two slices of bread.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
It's nothin'.

37:28.900 --> 37:30.400
And chips?

37:33.700 --> 37:38.000
You think a ham sandwich
and a bag of chips

37:38.000 --> 37:40.200
is going to make up
for a big fat lie

37:40.200 --> 37:43.400
about not calling me
after sleeping with me?

37:43.400 --> 37:45.100
I didn't wanna be
on the phone all night.

37:45.100 --> 37:49.000
Hey, look who's capable
of being honest.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I'm capable of a lot of things,

37:51.700 --> 37:53.200
even having a girlfriend.

38:03.700 --> 38:06.000
Jack. Jack.

38:07.300 --> 38:08.000
Hi.

38:10.100 --> 38:10.900
Hi.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.100
I think we should talk.

38:13.300 --> 38:14.700
I came by your house last night.

38:14.700 --> 38:15.800
Yeah, I know.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.300
Your dad really hates me.

38:17.300 --> 38:18.900
No, he doesn't.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.900
And I don't, either.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.800
I don't hate you.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.100
Guess that's a start.

38:24.300 --> 38:27.000
My dad doesn't think we should
be going out with each other,

38:27.800 --> 38:30.700
and, well, maybe he's right.

38:30.700 --> 38:32.000
Maybe he's wrong.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.100
I made a mistake.

38:34.200 --> 38:36.100
If God can forgive me,
why can't you?

38:36.100 --> 38:39.100
I can. If it was just a kiss,
I can.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.400
What did you think it was?

38:40.500 --> 38:43.500
I don't know. Was it
anything more than a kiss?

38:43.900 --> 38:45.200
Did you do anything else
with her?

38:45.200 --> 38:47.200
- Like what?
- I don't know.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.300
Did you have sex with her?

38:49.300 --> 38:50.800
What? No.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.300
Oral sex?

38:52.700 --> 38:55.900
Grace,?? don't let
your imagination run wild.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.000
It happened right after
we talked about that.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.700
Come on. I don't even know her.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.700
You think I'd let her
do something like that?

39:02.100 --> 39:03.800
Don't you think more of me
than that?

39:06.700 --> 39:07.700
All right.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.500
I guess I believe you.

39:11.700 --> 39:15.100
But still, you embarrassed me
in front of the whole school.

39:15.300 --> 39:16.800
If I didn't have
such high self-esteem,

39:16.800 --> 39:18.700
we wouldn't be having
this conversation now.

39:18.700 --> 39:20.000
??

39:20.100 --> 39:21.600
I'm really sorry.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.800
??Can we go out tonight?

39:24.800 --> 39:25.900
Go out? No.

39:25.900 --> 39:26.700
Why not?

39:26.700 --> 39:29.500
We can't just go out.
I have to talk to my parents.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.600
I don't know if they'll let me
go out with you tonight or any night.

39:32.600 --> 39:35.000
Can I call you? Are you gonna
take my calls now?

39:35.000 --> 39:36.500
- I guess.
- You guess?

39:36.500 --> 39:38.800
- I have to talk to my parents.
- ??Talk to your parents.

39:38.800 --> 39:39.900
I will,

39:40.300 --> 39:42.800
but I think they're gonna
need a little more time.

39:43.700 --> 39:45.000
And so do I.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
How much time?

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
You cheated on me.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.700
I apologized for that.

39:48.700 --> 39:51.300
Are you gonn make me keep
apologizing our entire lives together

39:51.300 --> 39:53.200
because I was stupid
and kissed another girl?

39:53.200 --> 39:54.200
Maybe.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.800
I was weak.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.700
I was tempted, I gave in,

39:59.300 --> 40:01.900
but Grace, I swear,
that's never gonna happen again.

40:02.300 --> 40:03.600
And if it did, I would...

40:04.100 --> 40:05.300
I don't know, I would...

40:05.300 --> 40:06.900
I would smite myself.

40:08.100 --> 40:09.900
Yeah, your dad said
he was gonna smite me.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.000
That's what he said.

40:12.300 --> 40:14.100
Let's just leave my dad
out of this.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.100
Love to.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.800
Look, what happened
is never gonna happen again.

40:18.800 --> 40:21.700
I wanna believe that,
but I don't know if I do.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.900
I think you're kind of
obsessed with sex.

40:23.900 --> 40:24.800
Since when?

40:24.800 --> 40:26.100
Since I put this ring on my finger

40:26.100 --> 40:28.400
and promised I wouldn't have sex
until I get married.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.300
??It did kind of upset me.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.300
??I wasn't even
part of the decision.

40:32.300 --> 40:34.000
It's my decision.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.000
Before I talk my parents into
letting us see each other again,

40:40.000 --> 40:43.900
you have to promise me you will never
pressure me into having sex with you.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.200
Not that you could.

40:45.500 --> 40:48.100
I respect myself,
and I expect you to respect me.

40:48.100 --> 40:49.800
All right, I respect you.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.900
Just promise me you're not gonna
make me wait ten years or something.

40:52.900 --> 40:55.000
There's not a time limit, Jack.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.900
I can't make you that promise.

40:57.600 --> 41:00.200
All I can promise is that
I'm willing to go back out with you

41:00.200 --> 41:02.300
with the aforementioned conditions.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.300
And if you get permission
from your parents?

41:04.300 --> 41:05.900
Yes, if I get permission.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.400
Then get permission.

41:27.300 --> 41:28.100
Hi.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.100
hi.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.300
I was looking for you.

41:31.300 --> 41:32.700
I was looking for you, too.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.100
- About last night...
- About last night...

41:36.300 --> 41:40.400
Yeah. I hope I didn't pressure you
into saying something you didn't mean.

41:40.500 --> 41:44.200
I know it's early for me
to bringing up the "L" word.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.600
You weren't gonna say that?

41:47.900 --> 41:49.600
No. Um...

41:51.300 --> 41:53.500
I was thinking that maybe
we should talk about, you know,

41:53.500 --> 41:55.600
what you heard about me,
if you want to.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.400
What, the thing with the drummer?

41:58.100 --> 41:59.000
Forget about it.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.400
Really, it's none of my business.

42:02.100 --> 42:03.400
??

42:03.400 --> 42:06.600
I don't wanna know about any other
guy that's ever been in your life.

42:06.600 --> 42:07.600
I...

42:08.100 --> 42:09.700
I don't think I could take it.

42:11.900 --> 42:17.100
So as far as me telling you
what I told you...

42:17.500 --> 42:18.600
not too early?

42:18.600 --> 42:20.800
Heh. I don't know. I...

42:20.900 --> 42:23.100
I've never had a boyfriend, ever.

42:23.300 --> 42:25.200
Well, I've never had a girlfriend, ever,

42:25.200 --> 42:27.000
in case you were wondering
about my past.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.600
Oh, I wasn't, but -

42:31.200 --> 42:32.800
Where's the French horn?

42:33.100 --> 42:34.800
Oh, I left it in the band room.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.400
??I've been thinking about
getting a tutor

42:36.400 --> 42:38.000
??so I can get in the band quicker.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.200
??Not that I'm jealous of anyone
in the band, I just...

42:41.600 --> 42:42.500
Love me?

42:45.700 --> 42:46.400
Yeah.
