But Regan already had

03:11.859 --> 03:13.527
the information
when she called.

he tell her anything

15:31.999 --> 15:33.133
How?

15:34.167 --> 15:35.502
Well, when I was doing
private security over there,

15:35.535 --> 15:37.070
the CIA had us doing

15:37.104 --> 15:38.438

all the time.

15:45.245 --> 15:48.415
they make their bones
by facilitating the use

of private security forces
in Iraq on behalf of the CIA.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.254
Let's just say
the CIA said,

15:54.287 --> 15:56.056
"You know what?
We want to do the same thing.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.490
"We want to do it here
in the states."

Right. Except the CIA
can't operate on US soil.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.563
Uh, that's a small detail
they get around

16:03.596 --> 16:05.465
by using Ombello as a fixer.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.534

how Ombello gets to do

and get away with it.

them in court, right?

was one of them?

between the CIA and Ombello?

So McMillan

36:57.483 --> 36:59.451
delivered 40% of the order,

36:59.751 --> 37:02.354

over there over here.

how does that fit in?

49:04.542 --> 49:06.511

a small army on speed dial.

could be monetized,

49:13.351 --> 49:15.186

offering our services

to protect shipments,

knew about this?

49:29.634 --> 49:32.103

encourage it.

49:32.137 --> 49:34.005

49:34.039 --> 49:36.074
they know they're never gonna
"win the war on drugs",
