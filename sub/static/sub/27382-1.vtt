02:47.516 --> 02:49.931
Mrs Marbury? 'Ya

02:54.826 --> 02:56.621
Mr Cust.

03:03.876 --> 03:07.090
Rent is two and six a week,
you pay up front and a week in hand.

03:08.365 --> 03:11.130
Some parcels got delivered for you.
We took them up.

03:11.155 --> 03:13.851
I trust you're not going to
be expecting that service

03:13.876 --> 03:15.621
regularly, carrying parcels.

03:15.646 --> 03:17.571
What do you think I am, a pack horse?

03:17.596 --> 03:19.411
You should have left them for me to carry.

03:19.436 --> 03:21.491
And have brown paper
items littering my vestibule?

03:21.516 --> 03:22.981
This is no post office.

03:24.516 --> 03:27.851
I'm very sorry to
inconvenience you, Mrs Marbury.

03:27.876 --> 03:30.340
The front door is bolted at ten o'clock sharp.

03:30.365 --> 03:32.731
I don't hold with none of
my gentlemen out carousing

03:32.756 --> 03:35.521
half the night.
I don't hold with no topers and sots neither.

03:35.546 --> 03:39.010
Nor no bad language,
profanities and blasphemies and the like.

03:39.035 --> 03:41.571
What I do hold with is old-fashioned manners.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.371
You mind your Ps and Qs
and we'll get along nicely.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.811
The privy is in the yard.

03:49.836 --> 03:52.901
I prefer my gentlemen to
not be cavalier in their use

03:52.926 --> 03:55.541
of the lavatory paper. It blocks up the pipes,

03:55.566 --> 03:58.451
and then who's got to get in
there with a stick and break it up?

03:59.876 --> 04:01.340
Me, that's who.

04:06.086 --> 04:07.731
Are you just passing through

04:07.756 --> 04:11.309
or do you expect to be a long-term resident?

04:11.334 --> 04:12.750
That all depends.

04:14.437 --> 04:16.482
On what?

04:16.507 --> 04:18.721
The success of my enterprise.

04:29.226 --> 04:30.922
Bed bugs?

04:30.947 --> 04:34.892
I run a clean house, Mr Cust.
A very clean house. No foreigns.

04:34.917 --> 04:37.412
Not like some round here
- take in all sorts,

04:37.437 --> 04:39.692
don't know whose air you're breathing.

04:52.997 --> 04:56.162
Mr Treadgold. One of my long-term residents.

04:56.187 --> 04:59.282
Got a bad back. My daughter Lily is helping him.

04:59.307 --> 05:02.162
Very skilled she is,
with gentlemen what have aches.

05:07.637 --> 05:09.362
A shilling for ordinary.

05:09.387 --> 05:11.131
You book through me. You pay me.

05:13.827 --> 05:16.162
She knows her stuff,
won't give you no argument.

05:19.667 --> 05:20.972
I'll let you get unpacked.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.772
I followed you the other day.

06:19.106 --> 06:21.201
You looked old and tired.

06:24.156 --> 06:26.642
You walk as if your feet hurt.

06:31.947 --> 06:34.442
I was rather concerned for you.

06:41.387 --> 06:43.562
I stood so close behind you.

06:45.827 --> 06:48.282
Could you feel my breath on your neck, Hercule?

07:00.467 --> 07:02.612
Plenty will say that it is vanity.

07:03.947 --> 07:06.692
"That puffed up, pompous
peacock Poirot," they'll say.

07:08.797 --> 07:11.442
And they'll laugh at you behind your back,

07:11.467 --> 07:13.692
but I'm not laughing

07:14.906 --> 07:16.412
because it's not vanity.

07:19.947 --> 07:22.522
I think you're trying to roll
back the time to when you were

07:22.547 --> 07:25.331
a famous detective.

07:25.356 --> 07:29.642
When you were celebrated,
when you were wanted

07:32.997 --> 07:34.522
when you were loved.

07:42.026 --> 07:44.852
I have never been loved,

07:44.877 --> 07:46.331
but I will be feared.

07:49.026 --> 07:51.442
I will be a faceless beast,

07:51.467 --> 07:54.572
leading lambs to the slaughter.

08:12.797 --> 08:16.362
I need to speak to Inspector
Japp on a matter of urgency.

08:16.387 --> 08:18.772
I know the way. He's not here.

08:18.797 --> 08:20.722
Where is he?

08:20.747 --> 08:22.881
Hoeing his cabbages, most like.

08:22.906 --> 08:24.881
Just a regular civilian now.

08:24.906 --> 08:29.331
He retired? Mm-hm. Who took over from him?

08:29.356 --> 08:31.972
That'll be young Inspector Crome, sir.

08:31.997 --> 08:34.572
Then I'll speak to him.
He's out on a case at the moment.

08:36.106 --> 08:39.331
Take a seat with the other members
of the public, if you'd be so good.

09:06.627 --> 09:08.131
Inspector Crome, sir.

09:10.747 --> 09:12.692
Hercule Poirot.

09:38.467 --> 09:43.682
I will be a faceless beast
leading lambs to the slaughter.

09:44.187 --> 09:46.522
Inspector Japp-

09:46.547 --> 09:49.852
"I'm going to do something
for both of us, Hercule.

09:49.877 --> 09:53.052
"I'm getting my ducks in a row, as they say.

09:53.077 --> 09:54.772
"I'll let you know when I'm ready.

09:54.797 --> 09:59.412
"Until then, chin-chin. ABC."

09:59.437 --> 10:03.622
Every letter from ABC has a different postmark.

10:03.647 --> 10:07.522
I keep the envelopes.
They're different from the others.

10:07.547 --> 10:10.412
What others? THE others.

10:10.437 --> 10:15.652
A small selection, presented solely
for comparison of tone and intent.

10:20.077 --> 10:23.881
"You're not better than us. Piss off, Froggy."

10:23.906 --> 10:29.102
19 years I've lived here,
and still people think I'm French.

10:29.397 --> 10:31.522
Are they all like this? Mm.

10:33.236 --> 10:36.932
You should have said you were retiring.

10:36.957 --> 10:39.162
I would have raised a glass to you.

10:39.187 --> 10:44.381
Ah, didn't want to make a big
song and dance. Just did it quietly.

10:47.317 --> 10:52.292
Japp, why wouldn't Inspector Crome see me?

10:52.317 --> 10:55.802
Well, you know what young men are like.
Want to make their name.

10:55.827 --> 10:58.881
He's a good lad, though. Just give him time.

10:58.906 --> 11:01.011
Why do you keep these?

11:01.036 --> 11:04.011
You should chuck them in
the bin where they belong.

11:04.036 --> 11:06.052
They come every day, Japp-

11:07.677 --> 11:12.292
The letters from ABC are polite, sympathetic,

11:12.317 --> 11:14.131
almost friendly.

11:14.156 --> 11:16.572
They scare me the most.

11:16.597 --> 11:19.412
And there is something wrong about them.

11:19.437 --> 11:23.211
I cannot put my finger on
what is wrong about them.

11:23.236 --> 11:26.881
Something wrong with them?
Everything's wrong with them!

11:26.906 --> 11:30.492
"I will be a faceless beast."
This bloke's off his crust!

11:33.366 --> 11:34.961
You're out of sorts.

11:36.397 --> 11:38.932
Too much on your own.

11:38.957 --> 11:42.772
Now, if you were busy,
you'd see these for what they are -

11:42.797 --> 11:44.652
nasty, cruel people,

11:44.677 --> 11:47.292
and some mad bloke playing
a vicious game with you,

11:47.317 --> 11:49.412
and you'd chuck the whole sorry lot of them.

11:58.236 --> 12:00.412
I've baked a ham.

12:00.437 --> 12:02.131
Got some spuds.

12:02.156 --> 12:04.062
Nice red cabbage.

12:04.087 --> 12:06.062
Come and have supper.

12:06.087 --> 12:08.602
Jam roly-poly with custard for pudding.

12:08.627 --> 12:11.932
Quelle horreur! English food. Come on.

12:11.957 --> 12:14.062
We'll set the world to rights.

12:14.087 --> 12:16.341
Even got some brandy left over from Christmas.

12:18.366 --> 12:21.572
I could use the company too, if I'm honest.

12:21.597 --> 12:24.452
If it is a favour to you, then I accept.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.881
Smashing.

12:25.906 --> 12:28.852
But first, I'm burning these.

12:28.877 --> 12:32.211
Every last single one of them.

12:32.236 --> 12:33.242
Japp

12:34.597 --> 12:36.091
thank you, my friend.

12:38.267 --> 12:40.732
Close the shed for me
and we'll head straight off.

13:05.236 --> 13:06.652
Japp?

13:08.156 --> 13:11.172
Japp? Japp?

15:17.757 --> 15:19.572
Good morning to you, madam.

15:19.597 --> 15:22.221
Do I have the privilege of
addressing Mrs Alice Asher?

15:22.246 --> 15:25.652
Yes, but don't waste your
breath on the patter, sunshine.

15:25.677 --> 15:29.862
I'm not buying anything and I've a
sandwich waiting, so on your way.

15:29.887 --> 15:33.011
You don't know what I'm selling yet, Mrs Asher.

16:17.447 --> 16:21.252
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.

16:21.277 --> 16:22.732
Blessed be the Lord.

16:24.637 --> 16:29.062
Man that is born of woman
hath but a short time to live

17:07.477 --> 17:11.781
Inspector Crome! Do not make me
chase you through a graveyard!

17:11.807 --> 17:13.811
It's beneath both our dignities!

17:16.036 --> 17:20.090
Mr Poirot. I need you to speak
to your colleagues in Andover.

17:20.116 --> 17:21.652
About what?

17:21.676 --> 17:22.891
Murder.

17:33.397 --> 17:35.422
This was Japp's office.

17:35.447 --> 17:37.091
It was.

17:38.996 --> 17:43.812
You still do those murder
parties, in the big houses?

17:43.837 --> 17:46.332
Like when you were a celebrity?

17:46.357 --> 17:47.662
Odd thing to do -

17:47.687 --> 17:50.612
rich people pretending to be murdered.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.011
Grisly.

17:52.036 --> 17:53.891
There's no longer the demand.

17:55.246 --> 17:56.732
Mr Poirot

17:57.967 --> 17:59.692
you appear to be melting.

18:06.887 --> 18:08.612
Must have been jolly though,

18:08.637 --> 18:10.891
cavorting with the gentry.

18:10.916 --> 18:13.052
The bright young things.

18:13.077 --> 18:14.302
The aristos.

18:15.357 --> 18:17.332
Playing at death.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.782
Fun while it lasted.

18:19.807 --> 18:23.891
Inspector Crome,
have I caused you some offence?

18:23.916 --> 18:29.112
Do you mean me personally,
or me collectively, as in the force?

18:29.527 --> 18:31.172
Both.

18:31.197 --> 18:34.141
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

18:34.166 --> 18:37.502
You're the great detective,
the solver of impenetrable clues.

18:37.527 --> 18:39.732
You work it out.

18:39.757 --> 18:41.332
Yelland.

18:41.357 --> 18:44.732
So I've spoken in depth to
our colleagues at Andover, sir,

18:44.757 --> 18:46.891
and received details of all crimes committed

18:46.916 --> 18:49.141
on the 31st of March, 1933, to wit:

18:49.166 --> 18:52.612
a dog running off with some laundry,
a bicycle thrown in a river,

18:52.637 --> 18:55.782
an altercation involving a
set of dentures. Dentures?

18:55.807 --> 18:59.971
Yes, sir, the miscreant being one
Herbert "Humpy" Morris, who

18:59.996 --> 19:04.332
requested that a passing lady give
him a smile to which she responded

19:04.357 --> 19:08.382
with some choice Anglo-Saxon,
whereupon Morris threw his dentures

19:08.407 --> 19:12.812
at her, the lady stamped on them
and it all turned into quite the to-do.

19:12.837 --> 19:16.332
What else? The usual run of drunk
and disorderlies and breaches of

19:16.357 --> 19:19.862
the peace, punch-ups,
soliciting and a boy broke the window of

19:19.887 --> 19:23.382
Asher's tobacconists but Mrs
Asher didn't answer the door

19:23.407 --> 19:26.812
so the constable concluded
she was in the public house,

19:26.837 --> 19:29.812
as she was often wont to be,
taped some cardboard over

19:29.837 --> 19:33.692
the window and let the young lad
off with a clip round the lug-hole.

19:33.717 --> 19:36.091
No murders. No, sir.

19:36.116 --> 19:38.091
No corpse in the library.

19:38.116 --> 19:42.252
No silver candlestick rammed
in some heiress' eye socket.

19:42.277 --> 19:45.172
No twitching guts in the conservatory.

19:47.197 --> 19:48.662
No, sir.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.971
Well, there we are then.

19:53.967 --> 19:55.742
I hope that puts your mind at rest.

19:57.717 --> 20:00.382
You know what day it is today, don't you?

20:00.407 --> 20:02.052
The first of April.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.582
Fools' Day.

20:04.887 --> 20:07.021
I think you've just been taken.

20:12.126 --> 20:12.172
Your time and effort in
this matter are appreciated.

20:12.197 --> 20:15.662
Your time and effort in
this matter are appreciated.

20:19.126 --> 20:21.662
Why's his chin all grey?

20:21.687 --> 20:22.862
Don't ask.

21:01.996 --> 21:04.221
Je vous salue, Marie, pleine de grace.

21:04.246 --> 21:06.462
Le Seigneur est avec vous.

21:06.487 --> 21:09.052
Vous etes benie entre toutes les femmes

21:09.077 --> 21:11.942
What offence do you think
you might have caused, Mr Poirot?

21:26.906 --> 21:30.091
Je vous salue, Marie, pleine de grace.

21:30.116 --> 21:33.451
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

21:34.786 --> 21:36.371
What offence?

21:41.956 --> 21:44.291
Je vous salue, Marie, pleine de grace.

21:44.316 --> 21:45.491
Le Seigneur est avec vous.

21:45.516 --> 21:47.521
Breaches of the peace, punch-ups,

21:47.546 --> 21:51.241
soliciting, and a boy broke the
window of Asher's tobacconists,

21:51.266 --> 21:54.371
but Mrs Asher didn't answer the door
so the constable concluded she was

21:54.396 --> 21:56.761
in the public house.

21:56.786 --> 21:58.451
Why is his chin all grey?

21:58.476 --> 22:00.681
Don't ask.

22:00.706 --> 22:03.781
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

22:03.806 --> 22:06.531
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

22:06.556 --> 22:08.171
The window of Asher's tobacconists.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.811
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

22:10.836 --> 22:13.371
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

22:18.596 --> 22:19.761
Assassin!

22:21.596 --> 22:23.681
Assassin.

22:37.876 --> 22:41.371
"I hope you're as excited as I am, Hercule.

22:41.396 --> 22:44.761
"I hope you're ready too.

22:44.786 --> 22:48.091
"31st March

22:48.116 --> 22:51.731
"Chin-chin. ABC."

22:53.476 --> 22:55.141
ABC.

23:00.876 --> 23:03.451
The usual run
of drunk and disorderlies

23:03.476 --> 23:05.811
and breaches of the peace, punch-ups, soliciting

23:05.836 --> 23:08.571
and a boy broke the window
of Asher's tobacconists.

23:08.596 --> 23:11.651
And Mrs Asher didn't answer the door.

23:25.626 --> 23:27.251
New tickets, please.

23:27.276 --> 23:29.121
New tickets.

23:29.146 --> 23:30.891
Thank you, sir.

23:33.196 --> 23:34.651
Sir. Merci.

23:47.786 --> 23:49.611
New tickets, please.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.761
Thank you, madam.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.291
Mrs Asher?

24:56.356 --> 24:58.331
Madame?

26:03.716 --> 26:06.121
I will find this person, madame.

26:07.396 --> 26:09.251
I will find them.

26:12.716 --> 26:14.481
I give you my solemn word.

27:23.277 --> 27:26.332
♪ Like the tick,
tick, tock of the stately clock

27:26.357 --> 27:29.662

Shut up, Lily! I can't hear myself bloody think!

28:26.916 --> 28:29.492
You murdering sack of shit bastard.

28:31.437 --> 28:32.582
Come on, then!

28:32.607 --> 28:34.612
Get in here!

28:34.637 --> 28:35.612
That's it.

28:40.437 --> 28:41.812
Get in!

28:45.197 --> 28:48.771
Going to the rope for this, you know that?

28:48.796 --> 28:50.812
Going to crack your neck.

28:50.837 --> 28:52.302
It wasn't me.

28:52.327 --> 28:54.891
Balls. It isn't him.

28:56.246 --> 28:58.971
Use your eyes, Detective Bunce.

28:58.996 --> 29:02.771
Alice Asher's neighbour said he
was always threatening his wife,

29:02.796 --> 29:06.221
that he said he was going to cut her throat,

29:06.246 --> 29:08.612
then he was going to cut her head clean off

29:08.637 --> 29:11.851
and he practically did cut her head clean off.

29:11.876 --> 29:14.382
Her head? Her head was cut off?

29:14.407 --> 29:15.862
Like you don't know.

29:15.887 --> 29:19.971
To inflict such a mortal wound with
a weapon inadequate to the task

29:19.996 --> 29:22.252
requires great strength.

29:22.277 --> 29:24.692
Monsieur Asher is a dipsomaniac.

29:24.717 --> 29:26.812
He has delirium tremens.

29:26.837 --> 29:29.971
He could not strike a match,
let alone wield a knife.

29:29.996 --> 29:33.692
And where is the blood?
He's not washed his hands.

29:33.717 --> 29:37.382
There would be blood ingrained
in the beds of his fingernails,

29:37.407 --> 29:40.052
the skin of his knuckles, his wrists,

29:40.077 --> 29:44.221
the cuffs of his shirt.
There would be blood everywhere.

29:44.246 --> 29:46.532
It isn't him.

29:46.557 --> 29:50.172
He bought some gloves and
then he chucked them after.

29:50.197 --> 29:55.412
Mon dieu, Detective Bunce,
you are no student of human frailty.

29:55.916 --> 29:59.662
Any money he has, he spends on his demon.

29:59.687 --> 30:01.582
On alcohol.

30:01.607 --> 30:03.382
He would not buy gloves.

30:03.407 --> 30:06.172
And the cash register was undisturbed.

30:06.197 --> 30:08.942
If money were the motive,
he would have taken it.

30:13.197 --> 30:16.971
You reckon you know it all, don't you? Hm?

30:16.996 --> 30:19.891
Well, you don't.

30:19.916 --> 30:21.492
Case closed.

31:13.757 --> 31:16.572
If Mum knew what you were really like, Betty.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.841
If Donald knew.

31:20.866 --> 31:22.402
He'll find out.

31:22.427 --> 31:25.652
But not before I get bored of him.
Because he is boring, Megan.

31:25.677 --> 31:29.482
The only thing interesting
about him is his pay packet.

31:29.507 --> 31:31.482
He is so boring.

31:31.507 --> 31:33.532
It's like talking to a plate.

31:33.557 --> 31:35.652
How did you put up with him?

31:35.677 --> 31:36.812
I loved him.

31:38.757 --> 31:43.482
All I had to do was click my
fingers and he came running.

31:43.507 --> 31:45.961
Threw you over like you were nothing.

31:45.986 --> 31:48.602
I did you a favour there, Megan.

31:48.627 --> 31:52.602
One day you'll see that and
maybe then you'll stop being

31:52.627 --> 31:55.812
such a sour, joyless, vinegar tits.

31:55.837 --> 31:58.532
Anyway

31:58.557 --> 32:00.652
sweet dreams.

33:07.277 --> 33:12.091
"Hello, Hercule.
What did you think of Mrs Asher?

33:12.116 --> 33:14.562
"She made a terrible mess."

33:14.587 --> 33:18.761
"You know what's next, don't you?

33:18.786 --> 33:20.652
"B"

33:20.677 --> 33:23.761
"But which B? And when?"

33:25.147 --> 33:26.252
"Chin-chin."

33:29.677 --> 33:31.732
“A-

33:31.757 --> 33:34.122
B-

33:34.147 --> 33:35.202
C"

33:50.357 --> 33:53.372
I should see the other chap, eh?

33:53.397 --> 33:55.202
Were you fighting over a girl?

33:55.227 --> 33:57.091
No.

33:57.116 --> 33:58.682
Oh, that's a shame.

33:58.707 --> 34:01.402
Girls love being fought over.

34:01.427 --> 34:04.011
Makes us feel all wanted and desirable.

34:05.866 --> 34:08.331
What you got in there?

34:08.357 --> 34:10.121
Family silver?

34:11.916 --> 34:13.612
I'm in sales.

34:13.637 --> 34:14.971
I travel

34:14.996 --> 34:16.202
with what I sell.

34:16.226 --> 34:19.292
It's polite to use a girl's name, you know.

34:21.706 --> 34:23.482
Betty.

34:23.507 --> 34:25.402
Now we're friends.

34:25.427 --> 34:27.452
What do you sell, then?

34:36.786 --> 34:41.841
Miss Barnard, table nine is waiting.
Just coming, Mrs Welk.

34:41.996 --> 34:45.331
Oh, I'm definitely keeping these.

34:45.357 --> 34:47.091
They're lovely.

34:47.116 --> 34:49.042
And very reasonably priced.

34:52.197 --> 34:54.252
I mean, if you're too busy now to get your purse,

34:54.277 --> 34:56.532
I can come back when
you've finished your shift?

34:56.556 --> 34:59.612
Oh, no, I don't pay for things.

34:59.637 --> 35:01.482
Men give them to me.

35:01.507 --> 35:05.562
I can't. This is my livelihood.

35:05.587 --> 35:07.891
You're a virgin, aren't you?

35:09.036 --> 35:10.372
What?

35:10.397 --> 35:14.052
You should be grateful that anything
you've touched is now touching me.

35:15.837 --> 35:20.172
This is the closest you're
ever going to get to my legs.

35:20.197 --> 35:23.252
Now slither off and play with
yourself thinking about that.

36:14.257 --> 36:16.871
And that's how you play backgammon.

36:30.697 --> 36:32.232
Not your night.

36:35.487 --> 36:37.352
You're breaking my heart.

37:09.417 --> 37:11.792
Thank you.

37:11.817 --> 37:13.792
Get your sweaty hands off me.

37:13.817 --> 37:15.722
You owe me for the stockings.

37:20.697 --> 37:23.751
Debt paid. Virgin.

37:40.057 --> 37:43.951
Donald. You're coming home with me.
Let go, you dozy bastard.

37:43.976 --> 37:47.472
You stay here, we're through
- I won't marry you.

37:49.057 --> 37:51.751
Oh, my broken heart.

37:51.776 --> 37:55.472
I have a chap in here who's got
more about him than you'll ever have.

37:55.497 --> 37:57.621
So off you trot and stop getting on my nerves.

38:04.537 --> 38:06.312
Don't run after him, Megan.

38:07.497 --> 38:09.392
Have some bloody dignity.

38:39.387 --> 38:42.672
"You know what's next, don't you?

38:42.697 --> 38:44.512
“B.

38:44.537 --> 38:47.312
"But which B?"

40:18.106 --> 40:20.081
Who is she?

40:20.106 --> 40:21.621
Elizabeth Barnard.

40:21.646 --> 40:23.592
Known as Betty.

40:23.617 --> 40:25.951
She works down at the Ginger Cat Cafe.

42:04.106 --> 42:05.951
My darling.

42:05.976 --> 42:09.242
My special darling baby!

42:09.267 --> 42:12.951
Who? Who would do something like this?

42:12.976 --> 42:14.362
Who?

42:18.017 --> 42:19.751
I've just been told.

42:19.776 --> 42:21.442
It can't be true.

42:21.467 --> 42:26.662
Someone took our girl from us,
Donald. Our perfect angel!

42:29.417 --> 42:31.112
What are we going to do without her?

42:33.187 --> 42:35.192
I'll make some tea.

42:41.906 --> 42:44.881
I thought you might require some assistance.

42:47.656 --> 42:49.912
"Our special darling.

42:49.937 --> 42:51.472
"Our perfect angel."

42:51.497 --> 42:54.192
Betty wasn't either of those things.
My sister was a slut.

42:54.217 --> 42:56.961
Mademoiselle, your sister is dead.

42:56.986 --> 42:59.112
She was still a slut.

42:59.137 --> 43:01.081
I can make the tea by myself.

43:17.547 --> 43:19.992
Do you want your walk? Mm?

43:20.017 --> 43:23.162
Do you? Oh, very well.

43:24.937 --> 43:26.522
I've finished my work.

43:26.547 --> 43:28.522
Would you mind if I joined you, Sir Carmichael?

43:28.547 --> 43:31.522
Not at all, but it is quite wild out there.

43:31.547 --> 43:33.552
Well, I could use the fresh air.

43:33.577 --> 43:35.682
And wild weather is exhilarating.

43:35.707 --> 43:39.472
Ha! Well, in that case, we'd love your company.

43:39.497 --> 43:42.322
Come on, Wilbur. Come on.

43:42.347 --> 43:44.032
Come on.

43:44.057 --> 43:45.112
Franklin?

43:49.856 --> 43:51.472
Go with them.

43:55.217 --> 43:58.192
You're the best brother-in-law a girl could have.

43:58.217 --> 44:01.192
Darling, I'm the only brother-in-law you have.

44:22.856 --> 44:28.112
♪ I think of you, night and day

44:29.467 --> 44:32.112
♪ Day and night ♪

44:33.467 --> 44:36.042
You're Mr Cust.

44:36.067 --> 44:37.162
Yes.

44:38.627 --> 44:40.552
Is there something you want?

44:44.347 --> 44:47.042
Is your mother in? She's out.

44:47.067 --> 44:49.631
One of her meetings. She'll be ages

44:49.656 --> 44:52.602
and be rat-arsed when she gets in.

44:52.627 --> 44:53.722
I see.

44:57.067 --> 44:58.352
Did you want to book?

45:01.776 --> 45:04.112
Cos if you did, you could book direct with me.

45:04.137 --> 45:05.831
Then I could keep the money.

45:05.856 --> 45:07.912
It could be just our arrangement.

45:14.547 --> 45:17.162
She tell you what it was?

45:17.187 --> 45:18.552
Shilling for ordinary.

45:19.656 --> 45:21.831
This isn't ordinary.

45:21.856 --> 45:23.682
It never is, Mr Cust.

45:23.707 --> 45:25.352
It never is.

46:01.577 --> 46:04.042
I see what you're doing! Whore!

46:04.067 --> 46:06.242
For God's sake! I see what you are! Capstick!

46:06.267 --> 46:09.602
She's the secretary, she's staff.

46:09.627 --> 46:11.961
She's trying to take you away from me, Car.

46:11.986 --> 46:14.442
Come on, my darling.
Come on, let's get you to bed.

46:14.467 --> 46:19.682
She can't wait for me to be dead.

46:29.757 --> 46:32.402
Sorry, Thora. She doesn't mean any of it.

46:32.427 --> 46:33.881
It's not really her speaking.

46:44.187 --> 46:45.322
Thank you, Lily.

46:45.347 --> 46:47.162
Mr Cust.

47:06.187 --> 47:08.352
Yes, Mr Treadgold.

48:25.777 --> 48:28.832
Warrant to search and seize
evidence pertaining to crime,

48:28.857 --> 48:31.473
evidence which you have withheld
from the proper authorities.

48:31.498 --> 48:36.693
When I tried to tell you about it,
you told me it was April Fools' Day.

48:36.977 --> 48:40.443
Please listen to me, Inspector Crome.

48:40.468 --> 48:43.163
A copy of the ABC railway guide

48:43.188 --> 48:48.363
was left beside the bodies of both
dead women. Do you know why?

48:48.857 --> 48:52.952
It is the killer telling us "les regles du jeu"

48:52.977 --> 48:54.913
the rules of the game.

48:54.938 --> 48:56.952
Every railway line,

48:56.977 --> 49:02.113
any station, in the country,
all letters of the alphabet.

49:02.258 --> 49:05.393
That is private! Warrant.

49:13.138 --> 49:16.523
"Dear Monsieur Poirot, my wife and I think

49:16.548 --> 49:18.343
"you're really rather marvellous."

49:20.138 --> 49:22.832
Old fan letters. Sweet.

49:24.298 --> 49:26.473
Pack the lot. You don't need them.

49:26.498 --> 49:28.443
He knows you,

49:28.468 --> 49:29.702
the killer

49:31.727 --> 49:33.673
so we'll be going through everything.

49:33.698 --> 49:35.983
Nothing's private any more.

49:36.008 --> 49:38.313
This was on the mat.

49:38.338 --> 49:39.632
I'll read it to you.

49:41.828 --> 49:43.832
What is the postmark?

49:45.338 --> 49:47.952
Cricklewood.

49:47.977 --> 49:50.163
"Hello, Hercule."

49:50.188 --> 49:52.752
"Betty was a pretty girl, wasn't she?

49:52.777 --> 49:54.063
"There was a moment

49:54.088 --> 49:57.832
"when she realised that death
was waiting with open arms.

49:57.857 --> 50:00.163
"She surrendered to me

50:00.188 --> 50:04.163
"and I leaned over her
and inhaled her last breath

50:06.218 --> 50:10.393
"..drew it into my mouth and it tasted so sweet.

50:10.418 --> 50:12.993
"I felt my blood sing with its sweetness.

50:14.578 --> 50:16.393
"But I'm tired, Hercule,

50:16.418 --> 50:20.163
"so we'll have a little rest and
we'll pick up where we left off.

50:22.418 --> 50:23.993
"Chin-chin."

50:33.857 --> 50:36.913
Telephone the doctor now.
I'm not here for domestic duties.

50:36.938 --> 50:39.952
You telephone the doctor or
get one of the maids to do it.

50:39.977 --> 50:42.353
I am carrying a bowl of her
ladyship's blood that she's

50:42.378 --> 50:45.673
just coughed up and the maids are
changing her blood-soaked sheets

50:45.698 --> 50:48.913
so get off your skinny arse
and telephone the doctor. Now.

51:12.777 --> 51:14.913
Thora, tell him to hurry.

51:14.938 --> 51:16.803
She's in a lot of pain.

51:16.828 --> 51:18.603
Of course.

51:48.098 --> 51:51.193
I'll send a constable morning
and evening to collect your post.

51:51.218 --> 51:53.962
And don't make any more
day trips to crime scenes.

51:53.987 --> 51:56.243
You will not catch ABC without me.

51:56.268 --> 51:57.523
Yes, I will.

51:58.808 --> 52:02.353
My friend Inspector Japp had the grace and wit

52:02.378 --> 52:06.193
to know the limitations of his intellect.

52:06.218 --> 52:08.832
I wish you had one ounce of his humility.

52:10.268 --> 52:13.193
Your friend, Japp, who you deceived,
who you lied to for years.

52:13.218 --> 52:14.553
I never lied.

52:14.578 --> 52:17.523
You told him you were a
policeman in Belgium before the war,

52:17.548 --> 52:19.523
a detective, but you weren't.

52:19.548 --> 52:22.993
Questions were asked about you,
high up in the food chain.

52:23.018 --> 52:26.632
Questions about me? Why?
I have served this country.

52:26.657 --> 52:30.603
People don't like it when the force
are made to look like half-wits

52:30.628 --> 52:32.193
by a foreigner.

52:32.218 --> 52:35.603
It's out of step with the public
mood so questions were asked.

52:35.628 --> 52:37.913
Japp swore that you were genuine.

52:37.938 --> 52:40.603
That was him, loyal as a dog.

52:41.907 --> 52:45.913
But you were looked into
and there's no record of you.

52:45.938 --> 52:50.033
You are lucky you never
lived through an invasion.

52:50.058 --> 52:52.712
Things are burnt. Buildings. People.

52:52.737 --> 52:54.603
Records turned to ash.

52:54.628 --> 52:57.553
No-one had ever heard your name.

52:59.068 --> 53:01.193
No Hercule Poirot registered

53:01.218 --> 53:04.323
anywhere in the Belgian police before 1914.

53:04.348 --> 53:07.243
Japp staked his reputation,
his whole career on you

53:07.268 --> 53:08.793
and that was him over.

53:08.818 --> 53:12.433
His funeral should have been
packed, a guard of honour,

53:12.458 --> 53:16.353
but all he got was a handful
of old timers and you and me.

53:16.378 --> 53:21.393
He didn't die of a heart attack.
I reckon he just broke.

53:21.418 --> 53:24.073
And that's down to you and your lying.

53:24.098 --> 53:25.523
He told me none of this.

53:25.548 --> 53:27.523
Inspector Crome,

53:27.548 --> 53:30.043
I gave my word to the dead.

53:30.068 --> 53:33.882
I cannot abandon them. I must not.

53:35.657 --> 53:37.913
Your word is worthless.

53:39.378 --> 53:42.163
You're not who you say you are.

53:42.188 --> 53:43.632
Who the hell are you?

54:00.138 --> 54:01.793
Ils arrivent!

54:03.938 --> 54:05.273
Ils arrivent!

54:06.305 --> 54:12.851
