Pre vious/y on "Ha ven". ..

00:04.255 --> 00:07.042
If I go into that barn
when the hunter meteor storm hits,

00:07.175 --> 00:08.164
the troubles disappear.

00:08.301 --> 00:10.041
For 27 years, they're gone.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.384
The Guard wants Audrey
in the barn tomorrow.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.127
I'm not letting Audrey go anywhere.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.505
You know, you always come back
with a different name,

00:15.641 --> 00:18.018
but underneath,
you're always somehow the same.

00:18.144 --> 00:20.977
The first time I felt your touch
was the day you kissed me.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.641
This is not good—bye.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.560
She's trying to help this town,
and it is her choice.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.776
Audrey, stop.

00:28.905 --> 00:30.441
That won't work on the barn.

00:30.573 --> 00:32.234
What about hurting you?

00:33.451 --> 00:34.907
Nathan!

00:36.078 --> 00:38.364
Meteors, they're not stopping.
They're supposed to stop.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.488
Duke, go.
Save her!

00:41.876 --> 00:43.741
Audrey!

00:45.630 --> 00:46.961
Audrey.

[Loud rumbling]

00:55.848 --> 00:58.009
Audrey!

01:02.271 --> 01:04.307
Audrey, where are you?!

01:06.651 --> 01:08.562
Audrey!

01:10.571 --> 01:12.277
Audrey, we got to get
the hell out of here!

01:12.406 --> 01:14.192
This place is falling apart!

01:14.325 --> 01:16.031
[Loud boom]

01:16.160 --> 01:19.072
You should go now.

01:19.205 --> 01:21.446
I need to say good—bye.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.914
Am I even human?

01:26.379 --> 01:28.461
He belongs here now,
like his mother.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.332
—Ar|a lied.
—Yeah.

01:32.468 --> 01:33.583
You didn't kill me.

01:33.719 --> 01:36.677
Why would killing you ——
why would that end the troubles?

01:36.806 --> 01:38.467
Because you loved me.

01:43.187 --> 01:45.018
Aaah!

01:45.731 --> 01:50.521
[Muffled shouts]

01:58.744 --> 02:01.235
MAN: Earlier today, schoolchildren
at the Boston aquarium

02:01.372 --> 02:03.488
were stunned
when an unidentified man

02:03.624 --> 02:06.240
sudden/y appeared
in the seal tank.

02:06.377 --> 02:07.742
A spokesman was unable to explain

02:07.878 --> 02:10.585
how the man was able to get
into the tank in the first place.

02:10.715 --> 02:11.955
Look, listen to me.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.797
Audrey Parker --
you understand me?

02:13.926 --> 02:16.087
Her name is Audrey Parker.
You have to find her.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.460
Listen to me!

02:17.596 --> 02:19.552
Audrey Parker!

02:24.729 --> 02:27.436
Arena security wants to know
how you got past them.

02:27.565 --> 02:30.432
I'd like to know
how I even got to Boston.

02:30.568 --> 02:32.559
Oh, you're saying you got
amnesia or something?

02:32.695 --> 02:33.935
No.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.026
Maybe.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.984
Yes.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.073
Which answer's
gonna get you to uncuff me?

02:40.202 --> 02:41.612
None of the above.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.287
I told you to call Haven P.D.
What did they say?

02:45.416 --> 02:47.623
They said Duke Crocker's
been dead for six months.

02:47.752 --> 02:50.118
—Dead?
—Mm—hmm.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.835
Six months?

02:51.964 --> 02:54.000
No, l was only in the barn
for a few minutes.

02:54.550 --> 02:55.505
What barn?

02:55.634 --> 02:57.886
Look, Detective, this is obviously
a misunderstanding,

02:58.012 --> 03:01.345
'cause I am clearly not dead.

03:01.474 --> 03:04.511
Or maybe you're not Duke Crocker.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.020
I found these in your wallet.

03:07.146 --> 03:10.434
Kirk Davis, Benton Shore,
Calvin Banks.

03:10.566 --> 03:11.931
You want to tell me
what you're doing with these?

03:12.068 --> 03:13.228
Just call Haven P.D. again,

03:13.361 --> 03:15.477
and make sure you talk
to Nathan Wuornos.

03:15.613 --> 03:18.229
As a matter of fact, actually,
why don't you just let me do it?

03:18.366 --> 03:21.153
Because I can clear
this whole thing right up.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.822
The next call you make
is gonna be to your lawyer,

03:23.954 --> 03:25.615
'cause the second
your psychiatric hold is up,

03:25.748 --> 03:27.238
l'm arresting you.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.491
Identity theft, trespassing ——

03:29.627 --> 03:30.992
Buddy, it was just a fish tank.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.289
Welcome to Boston, Mr. Crocker.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.162
You had a good deal
going in Haven?

03:35.299 --> 03:36.835
You should've stayed there.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.003
Yeah.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.047
There's no place like home.

03:50.064 --> 03:53.022
[lndistinct chatter]

03:54.819 --> 03:57.686
[Wind whistling]

03:58.447 --> 04:00.233
—That's weird.
—What is that noise?

04:00.366 --> 04:03.608
Do you guys hear that?
It's getting louder.

04:07.665 --> 04:09.576
[Screaming]

04:14.004 --> 04:18.498
[Somber folk music]

04:46.579 --> 04:49.321
If I could just borrow your phone
for two minutes.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.539
I promise, you're not
gonna get in trouble.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.407
Yeah, appreciate you
looking out for me.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.125
Oh, trust me, dear, lam.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.414
That last bedpan change

04:56.547 --> 04:58.412
could've been
a very different experience.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.757
And they say chivalry is dead.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.547
Come on, just one call.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.045
Look, I'm already bending the rules
letting your sister in.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.052
—Sister?
—Audrey.

05:09.185 --> 05:12.427
I told her visiting hours were up,
but she gave me a sob story.

05:12.563 --> 05:13.973
It must run in the family.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.142
Audrey's here?

05:16.275 --> 05:17.390
Oh, thank God.

05:17.526 --> 05:21.064
15 minutes. She's not gone
when | get back, I'm tranqing you.

05:21.197 --> 05:22.277
Fair enough.
You're a wonderful woman.

05:22.406 --> 05:26.445
And, dear, those scrubs
look fantastic on you.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.631
Who the hell are you?

05:41.008 --> 05:43.465
I had to see you...

05:43.594 --> 05:45.130
See you with my own eyes.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.594
Where's Audrey?
Is she okay?

05:47.723 --> 05:49.509
All these months, I never dreamed
that you could actually be real,

05:49.642 --> 05:50.301
and then last night,

05:50.434 --> 05:52.049
l was watching the news,
and there you were,

05:52.186 --> 05:54.598
calling for Audrey Parker,
just like you did in my head.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.766
Um...

05:56.899 --> 05:59.390
Why don't we just, uh,
start with your name?

05:59.527 --> 06:00.858
Jennﬁeh

06:00.986 --> 06:02.362
Jennifer Mason.

06:02.821 --> 06:03.731
Yeah.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.527
Okay, six months ago,
l was working at the Boston Globe,

06:07.660 --> 06:10.197
actually having a pretty good day,
and then someone started shouting.

06:10.329 --> 06:12.320
So I got up from my cubicle
to see what was wrong,

06:12.456 --> 06:13.696
but there was no one there,

06:13.832 --> 06:15.368
but I could still hear the voices

06:15.501 --> 06:17.833
and all these names ——
Audrey, Howard, Nathan, Duke——

06:17.962 --> 06:21.045
and it wouldn't stop ——
the talking, the shouting, the crying.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.835
I could hear the same conversations
over and over,

06:23.968 --> 06:27.085
like a CD stuck on repeat,
so I thought I was going crazy.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.427
Well, it turns out l was.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.012
The doctors told me
l was schizophrenic.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.176
They told me
that the voices weren't real,

06:32.309 --> 06:34.220
that none of you...

06:35.813 --> 06:37.474
...were real.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.565
Your doctors were wrong.

06:45.698 --> 06:47.689
How is that possible?

06:47.825 --> 06:49.907
l have no idea.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.697
But look, you said it started
six months ago, right?

06:52.830 --> 06:54.195
—Yeah.
— I don't know how,

06:54.331 --> 06:58.119
but somehow I think
you were hearing my friends

06:58.252 --> 07:01.039
while we were stuck
in this, um, place.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.207
The barn?
That's what you called it.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.422
Yeah, the barn,
but it's not really a barn.

07:05.551 --> 07:06.757
I mean, it looks like a barn.

07:06.885 --> 07:10.924
Really, it's this, like,
big, crazy supernatural thing.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.887
No, no, no, no, Jennifer,
Jennifer, wait.

07:13.017 --> 07:15.884
| live in a town in Maine
called Haven.

07:16.020 --> 07:19.353
It's a place for people
who have special, um...

07:19.481 --> 07:21.096
abilities.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.814
We call them "troubled".

07:22.943 --> 07:24.399
Now, I think that's what you are

07:24.528 --> 07:27.065
and how you were able to hear
what you did.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.735
Okay, right now you're making me
feel more crazy, not less crazy.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.610
Yeah, I know how it sounds,

07:33.746 --> 07:35.452
but I'm telling you the truth.

07:35.581 --> 07:38.072
And if you somehow
are connected to the barn,

07:38.208 --> 07:39.243
then maybe
you can hear something

07:39.376 --> 07:41.583
that can help me
find my friend Audrey,

07:41.712 --> 07:44.624
'cause she must've fallen
out of the barn

07:44.757 --> 07:47.373
at the same time as me,
but I don't know where.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.637
After I was diagnosed,
I started taking medicine,

07:50.763 --> 07:53.721
and it made the voices stop,
and I haven't heard them since.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.466
That's okay. Look, we just need
to get you back to Haven.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.719
What? I'm not going anywhere
with you.

07:59.855 --> 08:02.267
ljust met you,
and you're some kind of criminal.

08:02.399 --> 08:05.891
Yes, lam a criminal,
but one with a heart of gold.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.984
Look, if you help me get out of here,

08:08.113 --> 08:09.614
we will figure out
what happened to you,

08:09.740 --> 08:12.732
and I bet you that Audrey can fix it.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.280
That's just what she does.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.704
Why should I believe any of this?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.539
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life

08:21.669 --> 08:23.705
thinking that you're crazy?

08:24.463 --> 08:26.624
No.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.294
I don't.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.007
But it was hard enough
for me to get in here.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.922
How are we gonna break you out?

08:33.055 --> 08:35.797
First, I need a paper clip.

08:36.225 --> 08:37.305
Second”.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.971
I need my pants.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.354
???

08:48.487 --> 08:50.694
Uh, sorry to say I do.

08:50.823 --> 08:51.812
Where's your car?

08:51.949 --> 08:52.813
[Line ringing]

08:52.950 --> 08:54.531
Okay, they're probably
not looking for me yet,

08:54.660 --> 08:55.445
but would you ——

08:55.577 --> 08:56.657
Do you want me to get it
and bring it back?

08:56.787 --> 08:57.572
Fantastic.

08:57.705 --> 08:58.820
You're not gonna ditch me,
are you?

08:58.956 --> 09:00.241
If I was gonna ditch you,
I would've done it

09:00.374 --> 09:01.910
before I had to flash
that orderly my boobs.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.657
All I said was
we needed a distraction.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.955
Well, it worked, didn't it?

09:07.923 --> 09:10.380
Okay, guys,
whenever things go sideways,

09:10.509 --> 09:12.545
one of you usually had
a good idea why.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.464
Don't fail me now.

answered their damn phone.

We all thought you were dead.
Where have you been?

09:36.493 --> 09:37.403
I've been in the barn.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.822
lt spit me out yesterday in Boston.

09:39.955 --> 09:40.910
Yesterday?

09:41.039 --> 09:43.291
The barn's been destroyed
for six months, Duke.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.248
I know, but time
must move differently

09:45.377 --> 09:47.288
when you're inside the barn.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.752
Maybe ——

09:48.881 --> 09:52.294
Maybe that's why when it spits
Audrey out with new memories,

09:52.426 --> 09:53.381
she doesn't age.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.545
Audrey's with you?

No, Dave, no.

but it's disconnected,

they said he's not
working there anymore.

but he's changed.

you should stop him?

11:04.206 --> 11:06.242
Stay here.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.370
All right, hang on.
I need a break.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.877
Hey.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.168
I need a break.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.042
I would've suggested Jamaica.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.266
Nathan.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.599
You smell bad.

11:34.528 --> 11:35.813
I thought you were dead.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.692
Yeah, well, I had other plans.

11:40.242 --> 11:41.322
Audrey?

11:41.451 --> 11:42.657
Nathan...

11:48.292 --> 11:49.657
Where is she?

11:49.793 --> 11:52.455
Where's Audrey?

11:55.924 --> 11:57.664
Hey, love, what can I get ya?

11:57.801 --> 12:00.918
—I want a screaming orgasm.
—Don't we all?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.669
—|t's a drink.
—We don't make them here.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.671
No stupid frat—boy drinks ——
house rules.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.344
The other bartender made me one.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.682
That a fact?

12:07.811 --> 12:11.520
Lexie, did you give this boy
a screaming orgasm?

12:11.648 --> 12:14.856
Well, he asked so nice,
how could I say no?

12:19.281 --> 12:22.899
After you went in the barn,
it vanished like it was never there.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.400
I made it back into town

12:24.536 --> 12:26.151
just as the last of the meteors
were coming down.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.869
It was chaos.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.331
Dave thinks you shooting Howard
disrupted the 27—year cycle.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.202
That's why the troubles didn't go away
like they were supposed to.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.584
Guard found out what I did.
They tried to kill me.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.753
Part of me wanted to let them.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.217
l was trying to save Audrey.

12:43.347 --> 12:44.553
Instead, I thought I killed her.

12:44.681 --> 12:48.720
I thought I killed you,
killed James.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.806
So what?

12:51.939 --> 12:54.601
That's your excuse for having
a six—month—long pity party ——

12:54.733 --> 12:56.519
letting people beat the crap
out of you?

12:56.652 --> 12:58.608
I needed money.
I couldn't get a real job.

12:58.737 --> 12:59.726
l have to stay off the radar.

12:59.863 --> 13:04.527
The Guard ——
If they found me, I'm dead.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.072
You got out of the barn today ——
it might have spit her out as well.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.410
Well, yeah,
I'd like to believe that too,

13:08.538 --> 13:10.199
but how come no one's
heard from her, Nathan?

13:10.332 --> 13:11.538
Barn sent you to Boston.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.874
Might've sent Audrey to Burma,
for all we know.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.288
You said Jennifer could hear
what happened in the barn.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.082
Maybe she can help us
narrow it down.

13:18.632 --> 13:19.747
Can we trust her?

13:19.883 --> 13:21.714
I don't know. I just met her.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.050
But she trusted me
when she didn't have to,

13:24.179 --> 13:25.419
and | get the feeling
that she needs us

13:25.555 --> 13:27.420
just as much as we need her.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.263
Do we take her back to Haven?

13:29.393 --> 13:31.224
Whoa... "We"?

13:31.353 --> 13:34.766
Look, Nathan, I'm used
to people wanting me dead.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.684
What are you gonna do
about The Guard?

13:36.817 --> 13:38.182
l'll figure something out.
I need my resources.

Got to send A.P.B.s out,
send hospitals descriptions.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.898
She could be hurt, disoriented.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.482
Okay, we got a full tank of gas
and some snacks for the drive.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.904
I don't know what you like,
but everyone likes Slim Jims.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.616
I like Slim Jims.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.287
Duke, you drive.
I need to talk to Jennifer.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.786
And you need to tell me
everything you know about the barn.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.124
This town's been through so much.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.217
How much more can people take?

14:06.346 --> 14:09.088
Well, the chief is doing
the best he can.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.298
Speak of the devil.

14:13.437 --> 14:14.973
Dwight.
Have they found anything——

14:15.105 --> 14:17.517
bomb materials,
trace of an accelerant?

14:18.316 --> 14:20.807
And hope still springs eternal.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.935
Nothing yet.

14:23.071 --> 14:26.108
Here we go again.
What do we blame this one on?

14:26.241 --> 14:27.230
It's a gas leak.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.153
A gas leak? Another one?

14:29.286 --> 14:31.151
Yeah, another one.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.822
You're not helping.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.243
I'm not the kind of help you need.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.367
That kind of help
was driven out of town.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.459
Or killed when the barn exploded.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.670
Duke called me this morning.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.461
Duke's alive?
Why didn't you tell me?

14:45.594 --> 14:46.458
ljust did.

it's not the only one we got today.

15:08.033 --> 15:11.525
Okay, I got to get today's till
to the bank before it closes.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.322
You gonna be okay by yourself?

15:13.455 --> 15:14.535
Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.

Did since the moment
you came in —— you're a natural.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.331
Well, I like it here.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.746
It's much better
than my last gig —— boring.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.289
Yeah, this place
will keep you hopping.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.504
At least most of the regulars
behave themselves.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.965
Tell that to the pinch bruises
on my ass.

15:27.094 --> 15:27.549
Oh, I don't know.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.134

You are wasting your time
looking around here.

Hey, can I help you?

16:02.504 --> 16:06.873

Uh, can I get a local beer?

16:07.008 --> 16:08.748
What, like, a microbrew?

16:08.885 --> 16:13.219
Yeah, there's a good one, actually.
I think it's from Maine.

I can do better than that.

to have a thing,

and I shot her,

17:28.882 --> 17:30.998
who found you unconscious
in that field.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.999
He explained your condition
to the doctor

17:33.136 --> 17:35.092
so he could operate on you.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.510
He could've let you die,
but he didn't.

This is Jennifer.

She's troubled,
connected to the barn somehow.

talking.

that there was another way

23:16.688 --> 23:18.644
to forget everyone
she ever cared about.

23:18.773 --> 23:21.435
Audrey was willing to die
to stop the troubles.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.900
Let's just say you're right.

23:24.028 --> 23:28.988
That means for the troubles to end,
you have to be Audrey's true love.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.324
Are you sure about that?

23:32.453 --> 23:36.742
I've never been more sure
about anything in my entire life.

23:42.547 --> 23:44.378
So I haven't seen you
around here before.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.213
I haven't come in before.

23:46.342 --> 23:47.923

Pretty name.

23:59.731 --> 24:00.891
You worked here long?

24:01.024 --> 24:02.685
—Mm, about a month.
—Hmm.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.227
Never worked in a bar before.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.896
You know, ljust thought
it would be fun.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.940
Thought I'd meet
some interesting people.

24:11.242 --> 24:13.904
Are you interesting, William?

24:14.495 --> 24:15.621
I've been told.

24:15.747 --> 24:19.365
Some things I like
to find out for myself.

24:22.295 --> 24:26.334
Well...l'm not sure
this is the place.

24:26.466 --> 24:29.629
My shift ends in a few hours.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.836
I think I know someplace we can go.

Do you know that guy?

24:48.696 --> 24:49.731
No.

24:53.618 --> 24:54.949
He has a gun.

24:55.078 --> 24:57.444
Yeah, could tell
by the way he moved.

24:57.580 --> 25:01.323
Wow. Wait.
Are you a cop or something?

25:01.459 --> 25:02.949
Not even a little.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.622
Damn, I hope
he doesn't try something.

25:04.754 --> 25:06.085
The last time I tried
to call the cops,

25:06.214 --> 25:08.170
it took them, like,
45 minutes to get here.

25:08.299 --> 25:09.914
Looks like you'll have to handle it
on your own.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.592

Oh, my God, he wants me
to go over there.

25:17.767 --> 25:20.474
—Can I get some quarters?
—Really?

25:20.603 --> 25:22.013
For the jukebox.

25:25.900 --> 25:28.562
Unbelievable.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.027
Thanks.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.418
Hi, what can I get you?

25:48.923 --> 25:50.379
Have a seat.

25:50.967 --> 25:54.050
You know, I'd —— I'd love to,
but we're really busy right now, so...

25:54.178 --> 25:56.965
Sit down.

26:19.954 --> 26:21.865
Listen, the cashbox
already went to the bank, okay?

26:21.998 --> 26:24.205
We don't have anything here,
just a couple bucks for change.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.825
I don't want your money.

26:29.297 --> 26:31.379
Well, then, what do you want?

27:01.579 --> 27:03.661
Hey, are you okay?

27:03.790 --> 27:06.202
Yeah. I think so.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.203
You gonna be all right?

27:09.045 --> 27:11.206
I'm good. I'm good.

27:17.762 --> 27:19.468
??? a police chief, huh?

27:19.597 --> 27:20.882
Yeah, Teagues talked me into it.

27:21.015 --> 27:23.301
We couldn't risk an outsider
coming in, poking around.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.811
Besides, town needed
a familiar face.

27:25.937 --> 27:26.767
When you disappeared,

27:26.896 --> 27:28.887
people that don't know
about the troubles didn't know why.

27:29.023 --> 27:30.263
A lot of them took it hard.

27:30.399 --> 27:31.730
And the people who knew why?

27:31.859 --> 27:33.645
The ones who knew what you did
took it even harder.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.484
You're taking a big gamble
coming back, Nate.

27:35.613 --> 27:36.728
Hold on. Wait.

27:36.864 --> 27:40.152
Is that Nathan Wuornos,
the old chief?

27:40.284 --> 27:42.275
I knew he wouldn't stay away.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.824
One of our latest incidents.

27:45.957 --> 27:49.165
Anywhere else but Haven,
I'd say it was a bombing.

27:49.293 --> 27:52.080
It wasn't a bomb. There was
no particulates found at the scene.

27:52.213 --> 27:54.454
Witnesses said it was like being
in the middle of a windstorm,

27:54.590 --> 27:56.296
only there was no wind outside.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.507
The wind just appeared
like the tornado?

27:58.636 --> 28:00.251
What could do that?

28:04.267 --> 28:05.723
We found that this afternoon.

28:05.852 --> 28:08.810
Lucassi said the sand got so hot
that it turned to glass

28:08.938 --> 28:10.144
and the victim was trapped inside.

28:10.273 --> 28:12.264
This was here in Haven?

28:12.400 --> 28:13.936
You know what it is?

28:14.068 --> 28:15.353
Yeah, it's called a fulgurite.

28:15.486 --> 28:19.354
l was on a beach in the Congo once.
These things were everywhere.

28:19.490 --> 28:22.277
The natives —— they called them
"petrified lightning."

28:22.410 --> 28:23.616
Lightning?

28:23.744 --> 28:26.076
The bolts would super—heat the sand.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.411
These things were
all over the place,

28:27.540 --> 28:30.657
except the ones I saw didn't have
dead bodies inside of them.

28:30.793 --> 28:33.830
Autopsy said the victim died
within the last 48 hours.

28:33.963 --> 28:36.295
We haven't had a lightning storm
here for weeks.

28:36.424 --> 28:40.087
So from out of nowhere,
we got wind, lightning, tornados ——

28:40.219 --> 28:42.005
all forms of extreme weather.

28:42.138 --> 28:43.423
So we got a bunch of people
running around

28:43.556 --> 28:44.796
who can control the weather.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.432
Or maybe just one person...

28:48.561 --> 28:50.097
Marion Caldwell.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.140
I didn't read anything about her
in the files.

28:52.273 --> 28:54.980
That's because there was never
an official report.

28:55.109 --> 28:57.521
It was Audrey's first day in Haven.

28:57.653 --> 29:01.145
Audrey discovered Marion
had a weather trouble,

29:01.282 --> 29:02.488
killed someone,

29:02.617 --> 29:05.984
but we thought her trouble
was under control.

—|'|| get an address.
—Yeah.

on the way here?

29:12.126 --> 29:13.286
—Mm—hmm.
—I want you to go there.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.044
That's where my boat is.

29:14.170 --> 29:16.536

which one is mine.

about my deal with Nathan.

wanted Nathan dead,

even after what he did.

29:57.380 --> 29:58.961
It makes you look weak.

And you know
I'll do whatever it takes

30:05.179 --> 30:08.592
to keep this town together,
to end the troubles.

30:08.724 --> 30:11.010
So will I.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.718
This isn't about Nathan.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.810
This is about Audrey,
and you know it.

30:15.940 --> 30:20.479
All you're thinking is that
she's alive and she's coming back.

30:22.321 --> 30:26.155
I met her decades ago.
Her name was Sarah.

30:26.283 --> 30:29.150
She helped the town then, too.

down the first time?

31:19.920 --> 31:23.458
She showed Marion that her friend,
Conrad, secretly loved her,

31:23.591 --> 31:26.424
that they could be happy together.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.585

before you freeze to death.

just as much as it us.

from the meteor storm.

that his arm had gone numb.

that Audrey had to go away.

39:07.596 --> 39:09.257
Nathan, look what happened today.

39:09.389 --> 39:11.380
I've been trying to hold
this place together for six months,

39:11.517 --> 39:13.633
and I can't do it anymore.

39:13.769 --> 39:17.512
When the troubles didn't go away,
people lost hope.

39:17.648 --> 39:18.979
We need you.

39:19.107 --> 39:22.190
l have to find Audrey.

39:22.319 --> 39:26.483
You did say that access
to police resources

39:26.615 --> 39:28.321
was the only reason
you came back.

39:28.450 --> 39:32.614
If you were just a detective,
you'd be under less scrutiny.

39:32.746 --> 39:36.409
Maybe bending the rules
here and there might be easier.

39:41.421 --> 39:44.003
I'll do what I can,

39:44.132 --> 39:47.670
but it's all just a Band—Aid
until we find Audrey.

40:18.792 --> 40:21.875
Hey! There you are.

40:22.004 --> 40:23.369
Yep.

40:23.505 --> 40:25.006
Did you find the tornado lady?

40:25.132 --> 40:27.498
Yeah, as a matter of fact, we did.

40:27.634 --> 40:29.750
Okay, this place should be closed.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.093
Oh, I'm glad it wasn't.
I was starving.

40:32.222 --> 40:33.928
And this is
the world's best margarita.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.843
Totally worth the cheat.

40:37.019 --> 40:37.758
You don't drink?

40:37.894 --> 40:39.225
Well, I'm not supposed to
on my meds,

40:39.354 --> 40:42.221
but your brother and I decided
that this is worth the exception.

40:42.357 --> 40:43.563
My who?

40:43.692 --> 40:45.023
Your brother.

40:45.819 --> 40:48.026
Duke?

40:49.656 --> 40:50.691
Wade?

40:50.824 --> 40:52.610
You're alive.

40:53.702 --> 40:56.785
So cool that your brother owns a bar.

40:56.913 --> 41:01.623
Yeah, super cool.

41:09.092 --> 41:10.298
Thank you.

41:10.427 --> 41:12.634
I don't know what I would've done
if you hadn't been here.

41:12.763 --> 41:13.923
You'd have been fine.

41:14.056 --> 41:16.638
Are you kidding me?
That guy had a gun.

41:16.767 --> 41:19.304
I don't think I've actually been
that close to one in person before.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.267
[Chuckles]

41:21.396 --> 41:22.806
Yeah, you have.

41:22.939 --> 41:24.600
Lexie, l have a confession.

41:24.733 --> 41:26.269
That guy was here because of me.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.392
What? Why?

41:28.528 --> 41:34.990
He was afraid I was gonna
tell you something,

41:35.118 --> 41:38.360
a secret.

41:39.206 --> 41:40.161
A secret?

41:40.290 --> 41:41.621
—About you.
—About me?

41:41.750 --> 41:44.617
How —— how could you tell me
any secrets? We've just met.

41:48.215 --> 41:49.580
Like what?

41:49.716 --> 41:51.377
Like...

41:54.346 --> 41:57.088
You think your name's Lexie,

41:57.224 --> 41:58.680
but it's not.

42:00.394 --> 42:05.184
In fact,
you're someone else entirely.

42:06.900 --> 42:08.561
Congratulations.

42:08.694 --> 42:12.027
You just won the prize
for the creepiest pick—up line ever.

42:12.155 --> 42:13.895
It's not a line, it's the truth.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.819
And unless you let me help you
find out who you are...

42:17.828 --> 42:19.489
Then what?

42:21.123 --> 42:22.579
No, what's gonna happen?

42:22.958 --> 42:25.950
A lot of people are gonna die.
