01:52.943 --> 01:56.228
The assistant warden wants this one
out of the block early.

01:56.321 --> 01:58.314
Wants to get it over with fast.

01:58.407 --> 02:00.648
Okay. Let's do it.

02:00.742 --> 02:03.114
Hey, wake up. It's time.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.749
Wake up. Let's go. It's time.

04:03.652 --> 04:05.645
This is it.

04:15.330 --> 04:18.035
7474505B.

04:19.543 --> 04:23.125
- What wing?
- Maximum wing, Block 9.

04:23.213 --> 04:24.292
Standard release?

04:24.381 --> 04:26.836
Parole, three out offiive.
Good behaviour.

04:28.593 --> 04:30.502
Give me a minute.

04:58.705 --> 05:01.279
One Timex digital watch, broken.

05:03.210 --> 05:05.498
One unused prophylactic.

05:11.968 --> 05:13.379
One soiled.

05:32.154 --> 05:36.234
Boots, black.
Belt, black.

05:40.621 --> 05:42.198
One black suitjacket.

05:44.708 --> 05:47.033
One pair black suit pants.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.997
One hat.

05:51.089 --> 05:52.833
Black.

05:54.718 --> 05:56.627
One pair sunglasses.

05:59.222 --> 06:01.547
Twenty-three dollars
and seven cents.

06:04.227 --> 06:06.433
Sign here.

07:59.171 --> 08:01.579
- What's this?
- What?

08:01.674 --> 08:03.251
This car.

08:03.342 --> 08:05.251
This stupid car.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.463
Where's the Cadillac?

08:11.433 --> 08:13.758
The Caddy.
Where's the Caddy?

08:13.852 --> 08:15.512
The what?

08:15.604 --> 08:19.269
The Cadillac we used to have.
The Bluesmobile.

08:19.357 --> 08:20.768
I traded it.

08:20.859 --> 08:24.607
- You traded the Bluesmobile for this?
- No, for a microphone.

08:24.696 --> 08:26.107
A microphone?

08:27.991 --> 08:29.948
Okay, I can see that.

08:30.034 --> 08:33.236
- What the hell is this?
- This was a bargain.

08:33.328 --> 08:36.578
I picked it up at the Mount Prospect
City Police Auction last spring.

08:36.666 --> 08:40.580
It's an old Mount Prospect police car.
They were practically giving them away.

08:41.962 --> 08:44.203
Well, thankyou, pal.

08:45.591 --> 08:47.630
The day I get out of prison...

08:47.718 --> 08:51.502
my own brother picks me up
in a police car.

09:15.828 --> 09:17.821
You don't like it?

09:21.417 --> 09:23.326
No, I don't like it.

09:42.271 --> 09:44.180
Car's got a lot of pick-up.

09:44.273 --> 09:47.273
It's got a cop motor,
a 440-cubic-inch plant.

09:47.359 --> 09:51.024
It's got cop tyres,
cop suspension, cop shocks.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.235
A model made
before catalytic converters...

09:53.323 --> 09:55.861
so it'll run good on regular gas.

09:55.950 --> 09:59.366
What do you say?
Is it the new Bluesmobile, or what?

10:02.290 --> 10:04.199
Fix the cigarette lighter.

10:41.119 --> 10:43.028
What are we doing here?

10:44.622 --> 10:47.457
You promised you'd visit
the Penguin the day you got out.

10:47.542 --> 10:50.745
Yeah. So I lied to her.

10:50.837 --> 10:52.913
You can't lie to a nun.

10:53.005 --> 10:55.757
We gotta go in
and visit the Penguin.

10:55.842 --> 10:59.175
No fucking way.

11:58.527 --> 12:00.852
Who is it?

12:00.946 --> 12:02.855
Jake and Elwood.

12:06.743 --> 12:08.154
Come in.

12:25.303 --> 12:27.011
Hello, boys.

12:28.264 --> 12:30.553
Nice to see you.

12:30.641 --> 12:33.642
Please, have a seat.

12:49.660 --> 12:50.774
No, boys.

12:50.869 --> 12:53.027
Come over here in front of me.

12:53.121 --> 12:55.992
I want to see your faces.

13:09.012 --> 13:13.590
The county took a tax assessment
ofthis property last month.

13:13.683 --> 13:16.518
They want $5,000.

13:16.602 --> 13:18.429
Won't the church pay?

13:19.689 --> 13:22.808
They would ifthey were
interested in keeping the place.

13:24.318 --> 13:26.607
But they aren't.

13:26.695 --> 13:31.025
The archbishop wants to sell this
building to the Board of Education.

13:31.116 --> 13:32.694
What will happen to you?

13:32.785 --> 13:35.489
I'll be sent to the missions--

13:35.579 --> 13:39.908
Africa, Latin America...

13:40.000 --> 13:41.624
- Korea.
- Forget it!

13:41.710 --> 13:45.244
Five grand? No problem. We'll have it
foryou in the morning. Let's go.

13:46.548 --> 13:49.999
I will not take
your fii lthy, stolen money!

13:52.637 --> 13:56.587
Well, then.
I guess you're really up shit creek.

13:58.768 --> 14:00.926
I beg your pardon.
What did you say?

14:02.104 --> 14:04.014
I offered to help you.

14:05.441 --> 14:08.358
You refused to take our money.

14:09.570 --> 14:12.855
Then I said,
''I guess you're really up shit creek.''

14:13.782 --> 14:15.692
- Christ,Jake, take it easy, man.
- Elwood!

14:15.784 --> 14:18.904
- Ow! Shit!
-Jesus Christ!

14:18.996 --> 14:20.573
- Shit!
-Jesus!

14:20.664 --> 14:22.989
- Shit! Goddam it!
- Son ofa bitch!

14:27.295 --> 14:28.873
You fat penguin!

14:33.134 --> 14:34.083
Fuck this!

14:47.023 --> 14:49.774
You are
such a disappointing pair.

14:49.859 --> 14:52.943
I prayed so hard foryou.

14:53.029 --> 14:54.986
It saddens and hurts me...

14:55.072 --> 14:57.528
that the two young men
whom I raised...

14:57.616 --> 14:59.775
to believe
in the Ten Commandments...

14:59.869 --> 15:02.953
have returned to me
as two thieves...

15:03.038 --> 15:07.783
with fii lthy mouths
and bad attitudes.

15:07.876 --> 15:09.916
Get out!

15:10.003 --> 15:12.541
And don't come back...

15:12.631 --> 15:16.794
until you've
redeemed yourselves.

15:23.266 --> 15:27.133
Boys, you gotta learn
not to talk to nuns that way.

15:31.482 --> 15:33.274
Curtis!

15:33.359 --> 15:35.932
- You look fii ne!
- Good to see you!

15:36.028 --> 15:37.938
Buy you boys a drink?

15:41.492 --> 15:44.861
Boys, things are bad.

15:44.954 --> 15:47.990
They gonna sell this place
to the Board of Education...

15:48.082 --> 15:50.074
and I'll be out on the street.

15:51.794 --> 15:55.922
That money's got to be in the Cook
County Assessor's Offiice within 1 1 days.

15:58.884 --> 16:00.757
They wouldn't turn you out,
would they?

16:02.053 --> 16:06.881
Shit. What's one more old nigger
to the Board of Education?

16:08.601 --> 16:12.017
Curtis, you and the Penguin
are the only family we got.

16:12.105 --> 16:15.189
You're the only one
that was ever good to us...

16:15.275 --> 16:19.901
singing ElmoreJames tunes and
blowing the harp for us down here.

16:19.987 --> 16:24.898
Well, the sister was right. You boys
could use a little churching up.

16:24.992 --> 16:27.744
Slide on down
to the Triple Rock...

16:27.828 --> 16:30.319
and catch Reverend Cleophus.

16:30.414 --> 16:33.332
You boys listen
to what he's got to say.

16:37.713 --> 16:39.705
I don't want to listen
to nojive-ass preacher...

16:39.882 --> 16:42.170
talking to me
about heaven and hell.

16:43.260 --> 16:46.426
You get wise.
You get to church!

17:03.112 --> 17:04.904
All I'm saying is,
we got to fii gure out...

17:04.989 --> 17:07.480
some way
to get that money honestly.

17:08.617 --> 17:10.694
That could be a problem.

17:10.786 --> 17:12.115
Like the Penguin says.

17:12.204 --> 17:15.868
We got to move toward redemption.
We got to go to church.

17:15.958 --> 17:19.457
''We got to move toward redemption.
We got to go to church.''

17:19.545 --> 17:20.920
Bullshit.

17:21.005 --> 17:23.163
Come on.

17:43.485 --> 17:45.561
And now, this week's sermon...

17:45.653 --> 17:48.773
is from our beloved,
the Reverend Cleophus James!

17:56.622 --> 17:58.947
And now, people--

18:00.293 --> 18:02.202
And now, people--

18:03.295 --> 18:08.716
When I woke up this morning,
I heard a disturbing sound.

18:10.511 --> 18:13.714
I said,
when I woke up this morning...

18:13.806 --> 18:16.213
I heard a disturbing sound!

18:17.559 --> 18:21.142
What I heard
was the jingle-jangle...

18:21.229 --> 18:23.222
ofa thousand lost souls!

18:24.357 --> 18:27.940
I'm talking about the souls
of mortal men and women...

18:28.028 --> 18:29.985
departed from this life!

18:31.448 --> 18:33.072
Wait a minute!

18:33.158 --> 18:37.819
Those lost, anguished souls
roaming unseen over the earth...

18:39.330 --> 18:41.488
seeking a divine light...

18:41.582 --> 18:45.200
they'll not fii nd
because it's too late!

18:46.921 --> 18:51.049
Too late! Yeah! Too late
for them to ever see again...

18:51.133 --> 18:55.842
the light they once chose
not to follow! All right!

18:55.929 --> 18:59.096
Don't be lost
when the time comes!

18:59.183 --> 19:02.883
For the day ofthe Lord cometh...

19:02.978 --> 19:05.647
as a thief in the night!

19:05.731 --> 19:08.648
Amen

19:09.734 --> 19:11.644
Say amen!

19:19.577 --> 19:21.119
- Let us all
- All go back

19:21.204 --> 19:22.828
- To the old
- Old landmark

19:29.170 --> 19:32.336
As we stay
in the service of the Lord

19:32.423 --> 19:35.340
- Let uspreach
- Preach the word

19:35.426 --> 19:38.961
- Got topreach
- Preach the wordall the way

19:42.141 --> 19:44.217
Do it, knowit, feelit

21:05.763 --> 21:08.301
Jake, are you all right?

21:21.945 --> 21:25.528
Alleluia

21:27.868 --> 21:30.074
The band.

21:32.914 --> 21:34.706
Do you see the light?

21:40.046 --> 21:41.457
What light?

21:41.548 --> 21:43.540
Have you seen the light?

21:43.633 --> 21:48.971
Yes!
Jesus H. Tap-Dancing Christ!

21:49.055 --> 21:51.972
I have seen the light!

22:14.079 --> 22:15.490
The band!

22:25.423 --> 22:29.752
- Praise God!
- And God bless the United States!

23:33.280 --> 23:38.950
Stay in theservice
ofthe Lord

23:48.879 --> 23:50.918
Yea, Lord

24:16.364 --> 24:19.779
We'll put the band back together,
we do a few gigs...

24:19.867 --> 24:23.152
we get some bread.
Bang-- five thousand bucks!

24:23.245 --> 24:27.741
Well, getting the band
back together might not be that easy.

24:27.833 --> 24:30.750
- What are you talking about?
- They split.

24:30.836 --> 24:32.959
They all took straightjobs.

24:33.046 --> 24:35.205
Yeah? So you know
where they are.

24:35.298 --> 24:37.421
You said you were
keeping in touch with them.

24:38.802 --> 24:43.262
I got a couple of leads,
a few phone numbers.

24:43.348 --> 24:46.384
But, I mean, how many ofthem
visited or even wrote you?

24:46.476 --> 24:49.809
They're not the kind of guys
who write letters.

24:49.896 --> 24:52.731
You were outside.
I was inside.

24:52.815 --> 24:56.184
You were supposed to keep
in touch with the band.

24:56.277 --> 24:59.194
I kept asking you
ifwe were gonna play again.

24:59.280 --> 25:03.230
What was I gonna do,
take away your only hope?

25:04.326 --> 25:07.327
Take away the very thing
that kept you going in there?

25:07.413 --> 25:10.248
I took the liberty
of bullshitting you. Okay?

25:10.332 --> 25:15.041
- You lied to me.
- It wasn't lies. It wasjust bullshit.

25:28.183 --> 25:29.926
- Shit.
- What?

25:30.018 --> 25:31.927
- Rollers.
- No.

25:32.020 --> 25:33.644
Shit.

26:10.891 --> 26:14.935
- What? What did I do?
- You failed to stop at a red signal.

26:15.020 --> 26:17.345
The light was yellow, sir.

26:17.439 --> 26:19.846
May I see your license, please?

26:26.531 --> 26:27.941
Goddam it!

26:28.032 --> 26:31.567
I haven't been pulled over
in six months.

26:31.661 --> 26:33.949
I bet those cops
have got SCMODS.

26:36.582 --> 26:41.327
State County Municipal Offender
Data System.

27:06.945 --> 27:10.360
Elwood, we show your license
currently under suspension.

27:10.448 --> 27:12.856
Step out ofthe car, please.

27:34.012 --> 27:37.381
First you trade the Cadillac
for a microphone.

27:37.474 --> 27:39.716
Then you lie to me
about the band.

27:39.810 --> 27:42.051
Now you're gonna put me
right back in thejoint!

27:42.145 --> 27:44.980
They're not gonna catch us.
We're on a mission from God.

28:02.457 --> 28:06.205
We are in high-speed pursuit
northbound on Courtland Avenue.

28:06.294 --> 28:09.745
Black-and-white 1 974 Dodge sedan
with Illinois plates.

28:09.839 --> 28:12.045
Request assistance.

28:36.156 --> 28:39.073
We'll be all right ifwe can
just get back on the expressway.

28:40.827 --> 28:43.318
This don't look
like no expressway to me!

28:45.331 --> 28:47.288
Don't yell at me.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.617
What do you want me to do,
motor head?

28:49.710 --> 28:51.786
Try not to be so negative
all the time.

28:51.879 --> 28:54.833
Why don't you offer
some constructive criticism?

28:59.136 --> 29:03.597
You got us into this parking lot, pal.
Now you get us out!

29:03.682 --> 29:06.553
You want out
ofthis parking lot?

29:09.104 --> 29:11.393
- Will there be anything else?
- Do you have Miss Piggy?

29:31.250 --> 29:35.248
- There's pants and burgers.
- Yeah, lots ofspace in this mall.

29:48.183 --> 29:50.306
Disco pants and haircuts.

30:17.754 --> 30:19.663
Baby clothes.

30:19.756 --> 30:21.878
This place has got everything.

30:35.521 --> 30:37.763
New Oldsmobiles
are in early this year.

30:58.209 --> 31:00.166
Pier 1 Imports.

31:13.933 --> 31:15.344
Oh, shit!

31:53.971 --> 31:56.427
They broke my watch!

31:56.516 --> 31:59.089
I'm gonna catch that sucker...

31:59.185 --> 32:02.020
if it's the last thing
I ever do.

34:51.518 --> 34:54.518
Nice place, huh?

35:47.113 --> 35:48.524
Hey, Sam.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.919
Hey, Lloyd.

36:03.003 --> 36:06.253
- Anybody call for me on the phone?
- No. No calls.

36:06.340 --> 36:10.918
Some guy left his card.
Cop. Said he'd be back.

36:20.604 --> 36:23.972
This here's my brother,Jake.
He just got out of the joint.

36:24.065 --> 36:27.102
He's gonna be staying with me
for a few weeks.

36:27.193 --> 36:28.853
Yeah. Okay.

36:30.780 --> 36:33.697
Did you get me
my Cheez Whiz, boy?

36:55.679 --> 36:58.596
Well, it ain't much,
but it's home.

36:59.725 --> 37:03.556
- How often does the train go by?
- So often you won't even notice it.

37:31.964 --> 37:33.375
What are you doing?

37:33.466 --> 37:35.873
Making dinner.
Want some?

37:40.973 --> 37:43.261
Tomorrow we got to get
the band back together.

37:43.350 --> 37:46.185
I'm gonna quit work
in the morning, fii rst thing.

37:46.270 --> 37:48.476
And how are you going
to get to work...

37:48.563 --> 37:51.813
Mr Lead Foot, Mr Hot-Rodder,
Mr Motor Head?

37:51.900 --> 37:54.391
Those cops tookyour license away.

37:54.486 --> 37:56.562
They got your name,
your address.

37:56.655 --> 37:59.324
No, they don't got my address.
I falsifiied my renewal.

37:59.407 --> 38:02.112
I put down 1 060 West Addison.

38:08.624 --> 38:10.534
That's Wrigley Field.

38:15.506 --> 38:18.377
I gotta hit the sack.

38:18.467 --> 38:21.302
Hey, you sleaze! My bed!

40:10.033 --> 40:13.367
This, gentlemen, is the elegant
abode ofone Elwood Blues.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.161
Thanks, Mr Mercer.

40:15.247 --> 40:19.908
- I kinda like the Wrigley Field bit.
- Yeah, real cute.

40:28.217 --> 40:30.257
Hi, Sam.

40:41.355 --> 40:45.602
Hi. Has my friend arrived yet?
He failed to report in yesterday.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.151
I don't want trouble.

40:47.236 --> 40:50.735
Tell us where they are,
and there'll be no trouble.

41:05.545 --> 41:07.039
Stand back.

41:51.589 --> 41:54.674
It's almost 9:00.
We've gotta go to work.

42:51.022 --> 42:54.556
Hello, Elwood. Sit down.
What's on your mind?

42:55.443 --> 42:56.853
I gotta quit.

42:57.653 --> 43:00.358
Why is that, Elwood?

43:00.447 --> 43:03.614
I'm going to become a priest.

43:12.918 --> 43:16.038
I'll call payroll and have them get
your severance pay ready.

43:21.343 --> 43:24.297
- Good luck.
- God bless you, sir.

43:24.387 --> 43:25.585
Thankyou.

43:39.860 --> 43:44.818
- What's this?
- This is the last known address...

43:44.907 --> 43:47.612
of Bones Malone
and Blue Lou Marini.

43:51.747 --> 43:54.701
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

44:39.501 --> 44:42.253
- Mrs Toronto?
- Tarantino.

44:42.337 --> 44:46.916
Ma'am, do you have a Thomas Malone
or Louis Marini living here?

44:48.260 --> 44:51.344
Not any more.
They moved out a long time ago.

44:51.430 --> 44:53.837
I don't take in boarders any more.

44:55.392 --> 44:58.725
- May we come in, ma'am?
- Please.

45:09.363 --> 45:12.946
Did they leave a forwarding address?
A phone number?

45:13.034 --> 45:15.951
Did they live quietly?
What were their personal habits?

45:16.037 --> 45:18.243
They were good boys...

45:18.330 --> 45:21.664
but they made
a lot of racket at night.

45:21.750 --> 45:23.660
Are you the police?

45:23.752 --> 45:26.078
No, ma'am.
We're musicians.

45:28.298 --> 45:29.709
Mr Man!

45:35.514 --> 45:40.057
- Yes, ma'am?
- They left this card. Maybe it'll help.

45:53.156 --> 45:55.148
Thanks.

46:53.839 --> 46:55.998
Thankyou. You're marvellous.

46:58.636 --> 47:01.423
Thankyou. I'm Murph,
and these are the Magic Tones.

47:01.513 --> 47:03.885
Steve ''The Colonel'' Cropper,
Donald ''Duck'' Dunn...

47:03.974 --> 47:07.094
Willie ''Too Big'' Hall
and Tom ''Bones'' Malone.

47:07.185 --> 47:09.225
We'll be back with the Magic Tones
for the Armada Room's...

47:09.312 --> 47:11.803
two-hour disco swing party
after this short break.

47:11.898 --> 47:15.184
Till then, don't you go changing.

47:18.655 --> 47:22.818
So you're out. You're free.
You're rehabilitated.

47:22.909 --> 47:25.910
What's next? What's happening?
What you gonna do?

47:25.995 --> 47:28.237
You got the money you owe us,
mother-fucker?

47:28.331 --> 47:30.869
Let's get something
straight here.

47:30.958 --> 47:33.330
The reason he got locked in the slam
in the fii rst place...

47:33.419 --> 47:36.373
was for sticking up a gas station
to coveryou guys.

47:36.464 --> 47:38.088
You're kidding.

47:38.174 --> 47:41.091
He pulled thatjob to pay
for the band's room-service tab...

47:41.177 --> 47:43.750
from that Kiwanis gig
in Coal City.

47:43.846 --> 47:45.755
- You did?
- That's right.

47:45.848 --> 47:49.181
So I don't want to hear
any more ofthis small-change shit.

47:49.268 --> 47:51.177
We're putting the band
back together.

47:55.607 --> 48:00.269
Who here at this table
can honestly say...

48:00.362 --> 48:04.490
that they played any fii ner
or felt any better than they did...

48:04.574 --> 48:06.567
when they were
with the Blues Brothers?

48:09.621 --> 48:11.827
You were the backbone...

48:11.915 --> 48:15.663
the nerve centre
ofa great rhythm-and-blues band.

48:15.752 --> 48:20.129
You can make that live,
breathe and jump again.

48:20.214 --> 48:22.337
Murph and the Magic Tones?

48:22.425 --> 48:25.591
Look at you in those
candy-ass monkey suits.

48:25.678 --> 48:28.251
And I thought
I had it bad inJoliet.

48:28.347 --> 48:30.589
At least we got
a change in clothes.

48:30.683 --> 48:33.256
You're wearing the same shit
from three years ago.

48:33.352 --> 48:35.344
Jake ain't lying, though.

48:35.437 --> 48:38.806
We had a band powerful enough
to turn goat piss into gasoline.

48:38.899 --> 48:42.184
We'll never get that fat sound again
without more horns.

48:42.277 --> 48:44.186
We'll never get Mr Fabulous.

48:44.279 --> 48:46.355
- Where is he?
- Forget it.

48:46.448 --> 48:48.855
Mr Fabulous is the top maitre d'
at the Chez Paul.

48:48.950 --> 48:51.026
He's pullin' down
six bills a week.

48:51.119 --> 48:54.535
- Matt Murphy got married.
- Where is Matt ''Guitar'' Murphy?

48:54.622 --> 48:56.698
He opened a restaurant with his old lady
on Maxwell Street...

48:56.791 --> 48:58.867
and he took Blue Lou with him.

48:58.960 --> 49:03.705
You'll never get Matt and Mr Fabulous
out ofthem high-paying gigs.

49:03.798 --> 49:06.549
Oh, yeah?

49:06.634 --> 49:09.207
Well, me and the Lord...

49:09.303 --> 49:11.628
we got an understanding.

49:11.722 --> 49:13.881
We're on a mission from God.

49:26.486 --> 49:29.108
Mainly French cuisine.

49:29.197 --> 49:33.065
No, sir. Mayor Daley no longer
dines here. He's dead, sir.

49:34.286 --> 49:36.907
Private dining rooms
are available.

49:37.998 --> 49:40.488
Oh, no. It was supposed to be
fiive years.

49:40.583 --> 49:43.418
Didn't you get fiive years?
No, sir, not you.

49:43.503 --> 49:45.412
And your name, sir?

49:45.505 --> 49:49.917
Rizzolo, for eight at 1 1 :30.
Thankyou.

49:51.844 --> 49:55.213
Mr Fabulous,
how marvellous it is to see you.

49:55.306 --> 49:58.260
- You're looking younger than ever.
- Wait. You guys can't come in here.

49:58.350 --> 50:00.426
Nonsense, my dear fellow.

50:00.519 --> 50:02.559
My brother and I
have come to dine...

50:02.646 --> 50:05.517
to celebrate my early release
from the service ofthe state.

50:06.525 --> 50:08.434
Wait. Let's talk outside.

50:08.527 --> 50:10.520
- Let's have a cup ofcoffee outside.
- Why, heavens, no.

50:10.612 --> 50:13.697
We seek a full meal and all
the compliments ofthe house.

50:13.782 --> 50:15.691
Come, Elwood.

50:15.784 --> 50:18.239
Let us adjourn ourselves
to the nearest table...

50:18.328 --> 50:21.779
and overlook this establishment's
board offare.

50:22.874 --> 50:25.875
Good evening. Chez Paul.
Wait! Hey!

50:25.960 --> 50:29.875
Sir, do you mind calling back
in about fiive minutes, please?

50:51.777 --> 50:54.149
We'll have a table
in a few moments.

51:00.911 --> 51:02.322
Excuse me.

51:02.412 --> 51:05.082
Give us a bottle
ofyour fii nest champagne...

51:05.165 --> 51:08.664
fiive shrimp cocktails
and some bread for my brother.

51:08.752 --> 51:12.500
We have a Dom Pérignon '71
at $1 20.

51:12.589 --> 51:14.747
That'll be fii ne, pal.

51:18.595 --> 51:23.422
Seriously, the food here is really
expensive. The soup is fucking $1 0!

51:23.516 --> 51:26.470
Let's go outside.
I'll buy you a cup ofcoffee.

51:27.270 --> 51:29.346
We're putting the band
back together.

51:29.438 --> 51:32.854
- Forget it. No way.
- We're on a mission from God.

51:34.068 --> 51:35.977
Hold it. Hold it.
What's this?

51:36.070 --> 51:37.979
Waiter? Sir?

51:38.072 --> 51:40.195
Please, waiter?

51:42.701 --> 51:44.610
Yes, sir? How are your salads?

51:44.703 --> 51:47.241
The salads are fii ne.

51:47.331 --> 51:51.909
It'sjust that we'd like
to move to another table...

51:52.002 --> 51:54.409
away from those two gentlemen.

51:54.504 --> 51:56.413
Why? Have they been
disturbing you?

51:57.632 --> 52:00.205
No. It'sjust that--

52:00.301 --> 52:03.670
Well, frankly,
they're offensive-smelling.

52:03.763 --> 52:06.515
I mean, they smell bad.

52:09.227 --> 52:12.144
Excuse me. I'll see if I can locate
another table foryou.

52:12.230 --> 52:13.640
Thankyou.

52:25.159 --> 52:26.736
Wrong glass, sir.

53:17.876 --> 53:20.201
How much for the little girl?

53:20.295 --> 53:23.462
- The women? How much for the women?
- What?

53:23.548 --> 53:25.624
I want to buy your women.

53:25.717 --> 53:29.133
Your little girl. Your daughters.
Sell them to me.

53:29.221 --> 53:31.628
- Sell me your children.
- Maitre d'!

53:40.023 --> 53:43.641
Cut it out. The owners are gonna
ask me to call the cops.

53:43.734 --> 53:47.150
- You wouldn't do that to me, would you?
- Hejust got outtaJoliet.

53:47.238 --> 53:50.322
He's on parole. You can't
call the cops on him, man.

53:51.242 --> 53:53.365
- We're putting the band back together.
- I said no.

53:53.452 --> 53:54.994
Absolutely not!

53:57.498 --> 53:59.490
How much foryour wife?

54:02.294 --> 54:05.912
We're putting the band back together.
We need you, man. We need your horn.

54:06.006 --> 54:07.797
I really can't.

54:07.883 --> 54:10.255
We got everybody except
Matt ''Guitar'' Murphy and Blue Lou.

54:10.343 --> 54:12.669
- We're getting them next.
- No way.

54:17.726 --> 54:20.976
Ifyou say no, Elwood and I
will come here for breakfast...

54:21.062 --> 54:24.098
lunch and dinner
every day ofthe week.

54:27.568 --> 54:30.818
Okay. I'll play.
You got me.

54:34.283 --> 54:35.694
Sir?

54:51.258 --> 54:53.831
White men!

54:53.927 --> 54:56.216
White women!

54:56.304 --> 55:00.254
The swastika is calling you!

55:01.309 --> 55:06.185
The sacred and ancient symbol
ofyour race...

55:06.272 --> 55:09.226
since the beginning oftime.

55:10.610 --> 55:15.070
TheJew is using the black...

55:15.156 --> 55:18.323
as muscle against you.

55:19.535 --> 55:23.153
And you are left there, helpless.

55:23.247 --> 55:28.075
-Fuckyou!
-What are you gonna do about it, whity?

55:29.378 --> 55:32.663
-Just sit there?
- Go back where you came from!

55:32.756 --> 55:34.583
Ofcourse not!

55:34.675 --> 55:37.545
- Son ofa bitch!
- You are going tojoin...

55:37.636 --> 55:39.095
with us...

55:39.888 --> 55:41.596
the members of...

55:41.682 --> 55:45.893
the American Socialist
White People's Party:

55:47.062 --> 55:50.478
an organization ofdecent...

55:50.565 --> 55:53.768
law-abiding white folk...

55:53.860 --> 55:56.315
just like you.

55:56.404 --> 55:58.693
Go to hell, bastards!

55:58.781 --> 56:00.240
Go to hell!

56:00.325 --> 56:02.483
I pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler...

56:04.954 --> 56:06.614
the immortal leader ofour race.

56:08.708 --> 56:10.581
To the order for which he stands.

56:12.628 --> 56:14.953
One great cause.

56:15.047 --> 56:17.716
Sacred and invincible.

56:17.800 --> 56:20.635
Hey, what's going on?

56:20.719 --> 56:23.969
Those bums won their court case
so they're marching today.

56:24.056 --> 56:27.175
- What bums?
- The fucking Nazi party.

56:28.644 --> 56:30.553
Illinois Nazis.

56:32.063 --> 56:34.305
I hate Illinois Nazis.

56:34.399 --> 56:36.771
Heil Hitler!

56:44.117 --> 56:45.362
Ten-hut!

56:59.757 --> 57:01.915
- Gruppenfuehrer!
- Yes, sir!

57:02.009 --> 57:05.544
Get that car's license plate number.

57:05.638 --> 57:08.674
We're gonna kill
that son ofa bitch.

57:35.625 --> 57:37.285
Come on home, babe

57:40.504 --> 57:42.663
Oh, come on home, woman

Thankyou, ladies and gentlemen.

59:58.221 --> 01:00:01.056
That was ''Boom, Boom,''
a song that I wrote back in the '50s.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.931
- No, you didn't.
- It was a hit.

01:00:03.017 --> 01:00:05.259
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

01:00:05.895 --> 01:00:08.599
I wrote ''Boom, Boom''!
I wrote ''Boom, Boom''!

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:22.737
- Can I help you, boys?
- You got any white bread?

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:24.238
Yes.

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:27.116
I'll have some
toasted white bread, please.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.499
You want butter orjam
on that toast, honey?

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:32.784
No, ma'am. Dry.

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:39.127
- Got any fried chicken?
- Best damn chicken in the state.

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:41.792
Bring me four fried chickens
and a Coke.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:44.176
You want chicken wings
or chicken legs?

01:00:44.265 --> 01:00:46.838
Four fried chickens and a Coke.

01:00:46.934 --> 01:00:48.761
And some dry white toast, please.

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:50.929
You all want anything to drink
with that?

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:52.681
- No, ma'am.
- A Coke.

01:00:52.773 --> 01:00:55.098
Be up in a minute.

01:00:55.192 --> 01:00:59.356
We got two honkies out there
dressed like Hasidic diamond merchants.

01:00:59.446 --> 01:01:02.981
- Say what?
- They look like they're from the CIA.

01:01:03.075 --> 01:01:07.986
- What they wanna eat?
- The tall one wants white-bread toast.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.950
- Dry. With nothing on it.
- Elwood!

01:01:11.041 --> 01:01:15.501
And the other one wants
four whole fried chickens and a Coke.

01:01:15.587 --> 01:01:17.959
And Jake! Shit!
The Blues Brothers!

01:01:18.757 --> 01:01:21.461
- Hi,Jake!
- Matt! How you doing?

01:01:21.551 --> 01:01:24.256
- How wasJoliet?
- Oh, it's bad.

01:01:24.345 --> 01:01:26.172
On Thursday night
they serve a wicked pepper steak.

01:01:26.264 --> 01:01:29.430
Can't be as bad as the cabbage rolls
at the Terre Haute Federal Pen.

01:01:29.517 --> 01:01:31.759
Or that oatmeal
at the Cook County slammer.

01:01:31.853 --> 01:01:34.390
- They're all pretty bad.
- Matt--

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.140
Me and Elwood--

01:01:36.232 --> 01:01:38.639
we're putting the band back together.

01:01:38.734 --> 01:01:40.228
We need you and Blue Lou.

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:42.691
Don't talk that way around here.
My old lady--

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.689
- She'll kill me.
- Ma'am, you gotta understand.

01:01:44.782 --> 01:01:48.993
This is a lot bigger than any domestic
problems you might be experiencing.

01:01:49.078 --> 01:01:51.070
Matt, what the hell
is he talking about?

01:01:51.163 --> 01:01:54.247
- Don't get riled, sugar.
- Don't you ''sugar'' me!

01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:56.372
Now, you not going
back on the road no more.

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.295
And you ain't playing
any more two-bit, sleazy dives.

01:01:59.379 --> 01:02:00.921
You're living with me now...

01:02:01.006 --> 01:02:04.754
and you're not gonna go sliding around
with your white hoodlum friends.

01:02:04.843 --> 01:02:08.675
But, babes! This isJake and Elwood!
The Blues Brothers!

01:02:10.056 --> 01:02:13.591
The Blues Brothers! Shit!

01:02:13.685 --> 01:02:16.888
They still owe you money, fool!

01:02:16.979 --> 01:02:18.094
Ma'am.

01:02:18.189 --> 01:02:20.228
Would it make you feel better
ifyou knew...

01:02:20.316 --> 01:02:23.601
that what we're asking Matt to do
is a holy thing?

01:02:23.694 --> 01:02:26.731
You see,
we're on a mission from God.

01:02:26.822 --> 01:02:29.574
Don't you blaspheme in here!

01:02:29.658 --> 01:02:32.196
Now, this is my man,
my restaurant...

01:02:32.286 --> 01:02:34.362
and you two are gonna
walk right out that door...

01:02:34.455 --> 01:02:36.578
without your dry, white toast...

01:02:36.665 --> 01:02:38.539
without your four fried chickens...

01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:41.247
and without Matt ''Guitar'' Murphy!

01:02:41.336 --> 01:02:42.961
Now you listen to me!
I love you.

01:02:43.046 --> 01:02:44.920
But I'm the man
and you're the woman.

01:02:45.006 --> 01:02:47.046
And I'll make the decisions
concerning my life!

01:02:47.134 --> 01:02:48.925
You better think about
what you saying.

01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:51.548
You better think about
the consequences ofyour actions.

01:02:51.638 --> 01:02:52.918
Shut up, woman!

01:02:53.515 --> 01:02:54.546

Let's boogie.

01:06:25.052 --> 01:06:26.961
Well, go ahead, damn it!

01:06:40.525 --> 01:06:42.103
Shit!

01:07:54.764 --> 01:07:56.555
Pardon me...

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.475
but we do have a strict policy
concerning handling the instruments:

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.932
An employee
of Ray's Music Exchange...

01:08:02.021 --> 01:08:03.930
must be present.

01:08:04.022 --> 01:08:05.682
Now, may I help you?

01:08:05.774 --> 01:08:08.692
Ray, it's me.JolietJake.

01:08:08.777 --> 01:08:11.529
I once rented some column speakers
from you...

01:08:11.613 --> 01:08:13.653
for my band-- The Blues Brothers.

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.361
Hey, Ray. It's me. Murph,
of Murph and the Magic Tones.

01:08:16.451 --> 01:08:18.158
Remember me?
I bought three Fender amps.

01:08:18.243 --> 01:08:22.288
- Oh, we sell a lot ofamplifiiers.
- Not like these. They were beautiful.

01:08:22.372 --> 01:08:25.908
- Upholstered with thick, red shag.
- Right!

01:08:26.002 --> 01:08:29.702
I remember now.
I'll buy them all back for 350 apiece.

01:08:29.796 --> 01:08:31.291
Three fiifty?

01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:33.920
I paid 800 each
not six months ago.

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:36.679
You know-- depreciation, man.

01:08:36.761 --> 01:08:38.719
Ray, we're here to buy stuff.

01:08:38.805 --> 01:08:42.009
We need pianos, amps, mikes--
the works.

01:08:44.395 --> 01:08:45.770
Go on! Get!

01:08:49.858 --> 01:08:53.642
Breaks my heart:
a boy that young going bad.

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:57.237
Tell me a little
about this electric piano.

01:08:57.323 --> 01:08:59.316
You have a good eye, my man.

01:08:59.408 --> 01:09:01.448
That's the best
in the city of Chicago.

01:09:01.536 --> 01:09:04.027
- How much?
- Two thousand bucks and it's yours.

01:09:04.122 --> 01:09:07.288
You can take it home with you.
I'll throw in the black keys for free.

01:09:08.292 --> 01:09:10.913
Two thousand
for this chunk ofshit?

01:09:11.004 --> 01:09:12.912
Come on, Ray!

01:09:15.091 --> 01:09:18.460
Really, Ray. It's used.
There's no action left in this keyboard.

01:09:25.225 --> 01:09:27.183
Excuse me.

01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:29.843
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the action on this piano.

01:09:37.863 --> 01:09:41.029
Well, lheardabout the fella

We'll take these axes.

01:12:04.046 --> 01:12:07.711
Naturally. And as usual,
I gotta take an IOU.

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:45.450
You guys go inside.
Get yourselves a bite.

01:12:45.544 --> 01:12:47.620
I've got to make a phone call.

01:12:47.713 --> 01:12:50.832
Does this phone call
concern our fii rst gig?

01:12:50.924 --> 01:12:53.332
Have I ever lied to you?

01:13:01.142 --> 01:13:03.550
What are we gonna do, man?
We don't got no gig.

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:05.721
How much money you got?

01:13:05.813 --> 01:13:07.853
- I got a quarter.
- That's enough for a phone call.

01:13:07.941 --> 01:13:10.016
Come on.

01:13:18.326 --> 01:13:21.243
- What are you doing?
- You said we were gonna make a call.

01:13:21.328 --> 01:13:23.155
I said I was gonna make a call.

01:13:23.247 --> 01:13:25.156
Who are you gonna call,Jake?

01:13:25.249 --> 01:13:27.040
Do you remember Maury Sline?

01:13:27.126 --> 01:13:29.664
Sline? Booking agent?
What about him?

01:13:29.753 --> 01:13:32.754
He got us some good showcases
in the old days.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.413
He got us the Morgan Park.
He got us the Ticktock.

01:13:35.509 --> 01:13:37.751
I got him laid.
He owes me.

01:13:38.804 --> 01:13:40.630
Give it a shot.

01:14:10.209 --> 01:14:13.375
There's got to be at least
seven dollars' worth ofchange here.

01:14:23.055 --> 01:14:24.465
Sir.

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:29.473
- What did you fii nd out?
- Okay.

01:14:29.561 --> 01:14:32.645
I called a friend
at the Motor Vehicle Department.

01:14:32.731 --> 01:14:36.146
That license plate is like a rash
all over the computer.

01:14:36.234 --> 01:14:39.069
The car belongs
to a known traffiic menace.

01:14:39.153 --> 01:14:41.823
- What's his name?
- His name is Elwood Blues.

01:14:41.906 --> 01:14:45.951
He's got a record a mile long.
And he's a Catholic.

01:14:47.286 --> 01:14:49.493
- Did you get his address?
- Ofcourse.

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:51.205
1 060 West Addison.

01:14:53.042 --> 01:14:54.916
Let's go.

01:15:08.181 --> 01:15:11.218
Anybody with that kind of record
is gonna make a mistake.

01:15:12.978 --> 01:15:15.469
I want all party members
in the tristate district...

01:15:15.564 --> 01:15:20.688
to monitor the city, county
and state police on their CBs.

01:15:20.777 --> 01:15:23.066
Mr Blues is gonna fuck up.

01:15:23.154 --> 01:15:25.645
And when he does...

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:29.690
he better pray the police get to him
before we do.

01:15:37.835 --> 01:15:41.667
We been in this car for three hours now.
Where is this place?

01:15:41.756 --> 01:15:45.006
I told you it'd take
a little while to get there.

01:15:45.092 --> 01:15:50.632
- What's the name ofthe place?
- The name ofthe place is--

01:15:52.766 --> 01:15:54.225
Bob's Country Bunker.

01:15:54.309 --> 01:15:57.892
- Here we are.
- Bob's Country Bunker?

01:16:16.164 --> 01:16:18.655
The sign says, ''Tonight only,
the Good Ole Boys.''

01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:22.332
Blues Brothers! It should read,
''Tonight only...

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.089
the Blues Brothers'
triumphant return.''

01:16:25.172 --> 01:16:26.631
Must be some kind of mistake.

01:16:26.716 --> 01:16:28.625
You guys unload the stuff.

01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:31.422
Elwood, come with me.

01:16:53.325 --> 01:16:55.116
What can I get you boys?

01:16:55.201 --> 01:16:57.775
You thirsty, hungry
orjust driving through?

01:16:57.871 --> 01:17:00.622
Maybe you'd like a beer
or something a little harder?

01:17:00.707 --> 01:17:03.376
We happen to make
the state's best pepper steak.

01:17:03.459 --> 01:17:05.582
No, thankyou, ma'am.

01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:08.291
We may be sucking back
a few beers later on.

01:17:08.381 --> 01:17:11.132
We'll be here all night.
You see, we're the band.

01:17:11.217 --> 01:17:14.383
You are?
Gee, that's nice!

01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:16.676
Hey, Bob, this is the band!

01:17:16.764 --> 01:17:18.591
All right!

01:17:18.682 --> 01:17:21.802
What kind of music
do you usually have here?

01:17:21.894 --> 01:17:25.726
We got both kinds.
We got country and western.

01:17:29.192 --> 01:17:31.648
Jake, are you sure this is the place?

01:17:31.737 --> 01:17:34.310
Yeah, sure. This is the place.

01:17:39.577 --> 01:17:42.365
- Hi! You the Good Ole Boys?
- That's us!

01:17:42.455 --> 01:17:45.456
The rest ofthe band's
in the parking lot getting our stuff.

01:17:45.542 --> 01:17:47.830
Well, I'm sure glad
to have you boys here.

01:17:47.919 --> 01:17:50.042
I'm Bob and this here is my place.

01:17:50.797 --> 01:17:53.963
Well, it's a beautiful place, Bob!

01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:58.261
I guess you wanna get your steel guitars
and everything set up on stage.

01:17:58.346 --> 01:18:01.430
Claire, get up and turn those stage
lights on and get these boys going.

01:18:08.105 --> 01:18:09.564
Chicken wire?

01:18:09.648 --> 01:18:11.854
What do you say
we have a sound check?

01:18:15.279 --> 01:18:18.897
Excuse me, sonny. I'll give this
to you. You're the tallest one.

01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:21.363
Okay. What is it?

01:18:21.451 --> 01:18:23.740
That there is a list
ofthe songs...

01:18:23.828 --> 01:18:25.904
that you boys
will be playing tonight.

01:18:43.514 --> 01:18:47.263
I don't think we know
any ofthe songs on this list.

01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:52.098
This list doesn't mean anything.
They'rejust requests.

01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:53.767
Do our regular set.
First tune.

01:18:53.857 --> 01:18:56.348
''Give Me Some Loving.''
One, two--

01:18:56.443 --> 01:18:58.400
One, two, three, four.

01:19:13.376 --> 01:19:15.203
Shit!

01:19:15.295 --> 01:19:17.620
What are those damn freak
pecker heads playing?

01:19:17.714 --> 01:19:21.842
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We're glad to be here tonight.

01:19:21.926 --> 01:19:26.754
We're the Good Old Blues Brothers
Boys Band from Chicago.

01:19:26.848 --> 01:19:30.014
We hope you'll like our show.
I'm Elwood. This is my brotherJake.

01:19:30.101 --> 01:19:33.801

01:19:53.415 --> 01:19:55.372
Get off the stage!

01:19:57.127 --> 01:19:58.407
Everyday

01:19:59.671 --> 01:20:02.078
Why'd they turn off the lights?

01:20:02.173 --> 01:20:04.711
- Maybe they blew a fuse.
- I don't think so.

01:20:04.801 --> 01:20:06.710
Those lights are off on purpose.

01:20:06.803 --> 01:20:09.839
We gotta fii gure out something
these people like, and fast!

01:20:09.931 --> 01:20:12.303
I got it. Remember the theme
from ''Rawhide''?

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:13.802
Old favourite. Rowdy Yates.

01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:16.728
- What key?
- ''A.'' Good country key.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:18.223
''Rawhide'' in ''A.''

01:20:25.779 --> 01:20:28.484
Rollin ', rollin '

Well, folks, it's time
to callit a night.

01:24:22.132 --> 01:24:24.884
But do whatyou feel,
andkeep both feet on the wheel.

01:24:24.968 --> 01:24:26.961
You don't have togo home
butyou can't stay here.

01:24:27.054 --> 01:24:28.548

Ride 'em in, rawhide

01:24:44.237 --> 01:24:47.440
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:58.032
Shit, I wanna tell you, that's some
ofthe best goddam music we've had...

01:24:58.125 --> 01:25:00.332
at the Country Bunker
in a long time.

01:25:00.419 --> 01:25:04.631
Well, sorry we couldn't remember
''The Wreck ofthe Old 97.''

01:25:04.715 --> 01:25:08.415
Why, hell! You guys can learn it
next time when you come back.

01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:11.760
Bob, about our money for tonight.

01:25:11.847 --> 01:25:14.516
That's right.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.639
Two hundred dollars...

01:25:16.727 --> 01:25:19.348
and you boys drank
$300 worth of beer.

01:25:19.438 --> 01:25:21.726
When we fii rst came in...

01:25:21.815 --> 01:25:24.650
the bar lady never charged us
for the fii rst round.

01:25:24.734 --> 01:25:28.779
So, like, we fii gured
beer was complimentary for the band.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.450
Well, I'll just go out
and take up a collection from the boys.

01:25:35.536 --> 01:25:38.158
I sure would appreciate it.

01:25:44.503 --> 01:25:46.710
I say this trip is nowhere, man.

01:25:46.797 --> 01:25:48.375
I say we gotta quit.

01:25:48.466 --> 01:25:51.502
What? Quit?

01:25:51.594 --> 01:25:53.835
I wish you guys
would make up your mind.

01:25:53.929 --> 01:25:57.512
Otherwise I gotta call Mr Ronzini at
the Holiday Inn to get our old gig back.

01:25:57.599 --> 01:26:00.304
Back at the Armada Room?

01:26:00.394 --> 01:26:03.311
Listen, they want us
to pay for the beer we drank.

01:26:03.397 --> 01:26:04.559
So you'd better split.

01:26:04.648 --> 01:26:08.562
The next gig is gonna be dynamite!

01:26:08.652 --> 01:26:11.059
Huge! You'll see.

01:26:14.908 --> 01:26:18.359
I say we give the Blues Brothers
just one more chance.

01:26:18.453 --> 01:26:21.026
Why not? Ifthe shit fiits, wear it!

01:26:21.581 --> 01:26:23.241
Scoot over, goddam it!

01:26:29.922 --> 01:26:31.831
Boys look a little upset.

01:26:33.092 --> 01:26:35.583
Hey, man. Don't worry.
We got a couple ofdays.

01:26:35.678 --> 01:26:37.836
We'll get the Penguin's tax money.

01:26:37.930 --> 01:26:41.974
I mean, look. We got an appointment
to see Mr Sline tomorrow.

01:26:42.059 --> 01:26:43.968
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:26:44.061 --> 01:26:45.638
Let's skate.

01:26:47.439 --> 01:26:50.060
Goddam it.

01:26:52.944 --> 01:26:54.937
Excuse me. Are you
the Good Ole Boys?

01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:58.114
That's right. I'm Tucker McElroy,
lead singer, driver ofthe Winnebago.

01:26:58.199 --> 01:27:00.737
I'd like to talk to you,
but we're running very late.

01:27:00.827 --> 01:27:05.074
I'mJacob Stein, American Federation
of Musicians Union, Local 200.

01:27:05.165 --> 01:27:07.572
I've been sent here to see
ifyou're carrying your permits.

01:27:07.667 --> 01:27:09.245
Our what?

01:27:09.335 --> 01:27:12.040
Your union cards.
May I see your cards, please?

01:27:13.548 --> 01:27:16.335
Suppose we ain't got no union cards,
and we go in and start playing anyway?

01:27:16.425 --> 01:27:19.592
What you gonna do about that?
You gonna stop us?

01:27:19.679 --> 01:27:21.837
Stein!

01:27:21.931 --> 01:27:25.763
You gonna look funny trying to eat
corn on the cob with no fucking teeth!

01:27:27.102 --> 01:27:31.811
Listen, let me talk to Bob,
the owner.

01:27:31.899 --> 01:27:34.935
See ifwe can put your band
on contract waivers for tonight.

01:27:35.027 --> 01:27:37.696
I don't want you to move
from this spot.

01:27:37.779 --> 01:27:39.688
Just let me handle this.

01:27:43.118 --> 01:27:45.443
We'll talk to Bob.

01:27:49.541 --> 01:27:51.664
Get in the car and start her up.

01:27:55.338 --> 01:27:58.422
You know you boys owe me
a lot of money for that beeryou drank!

01:27:58.508 --> 01:28:01.627
- Goddam it!
- Bob, we loved playing here tonight.

01:28:01.719 --> 01:28:04.424
My brother's writing out an
American Express traveller's check...

01:28:04.513 --> 01:28:06.305
to cover the bar tab.

01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:08.134
I sure would appreciate it.

01:28:08.225 --> 01:28:11.725
I'd better check up, see how he's doing.
I have to sign it too.

01:28:11.812 --> 01:28:16.688
I usually sit in the car and write it
out on the glove compartment lid.

01:28:20.904 --> 01:28:22.648
Need a pencil.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.169
- Were them guys from the union?
- What the hell, ''union''?

01:28:36.252 --> 01:28:39.502
Those boys skipped out of here
owing me a lot of money for beer.

01:28:39.589 --> 01:28:41.961
What the hell are you guys
all dressed up for?

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.544
We're the Good Ole Boys!

01:28:43.634 --> 01:28:46.719
You're the Good Ole Boys?

01:29:05.614 --> 01:29:08.568
''A.F.M.'' Shit!

01:29:26.843 --> 01:29:29.927
Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration,
don't fail me now!

01:29:43.943 --> 01:29:47.062
I don't believe it!
It's that shit-box Dodge again.

01:29:47.154 --> 01:29:49.562
The bastards are ours now!

01:30:09.008 --> 01:30:12.093
Holy shit!

01:30:21.813 --> 01:30:25.016
Boys, you in big trouble.

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.436
Maury, you owe me.

01:30:30.529 --> 01:30:33.364
We'll play anywhere, anytime,
for anybody.

01:30:33.449 --> 01:30:37.149
Put us in the Double Up Lounge, or
the Morgan Park Theatre, or the Crystal.

01:30:37.244 --> 01:30:39.652
We always knocked them dead
in thosejoints.

01:30:39.746 --> 01:30:43.281
Discos. They're all discos.

01:30:44.751 --> 01:30:48.001
Singles. Mixed singles.
Gay singles.

01:30:48.088 --> 01:30:51.005
These people like to dance
with each other.

01:30:51.091 --> 01:30:52.964
We are a dance band.

01:30:53.051 --> 01:30:55.589
I don't know, boys.
I just don't know.

01:30:57.013 --> 01:30:58.756
Times have changed,
you know what I mean?

01:30:59.849 --> 01:31:01.842
What are you guys gonna do?
The same act?

01:31:01.935 --> 01:31:03.761
You wear
the same farkakte suits.

01:31:03.853 --> 01:31:06.688
You'll scare people away.

01:31:06.773 --> 01:31:08.599
Don't you ever wear bluejeans
orjump suits...

01:31:08.691 --> 01:31:11.182
like Wayne Cochran
and the C.C. Riders?

01:31:11.277 --> 01:31:12.854
You gotta come through for us.

01:31:13.988 --> 01:31:16.230
We need 5,000 bucks fast.

01:31:17.324 --> 01:31:19.281

01:31:22.246 --> 01:31:25.412
You know the size hall you gotta work
to take in that kind of money?

01:31:25.499 --> 01:31:28.037
We'll fii ll any hall in the country.

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.625

01:31:33.715 --> 01:31:37.049
- Never heard of it.

01:31:37.135 --> 01:31:40.302
Built in the '40s
on Lake Wazapamani.

01:31:40.388 --> 01:31:42.215
That seats 5,000.

01:31:42.307 --> 01:31:44.714
You guys fii ll that place,
you can make 5,000 bucks, easy.

01:31:44.809 --> 01:31:48.558
- Book us for tomorrow night.
- Hold it! Tomorrow night?

01:31:48.646 --> 01:31:51.398
A gig like that, you gotta prepare
the proper exploitation.

01:31:51.482 --> 01:31:54.400
I know about that stuff.
I been exploited all my life.

01:31:54.485 --> 01:31:56.941
Forget it. There's no way
with you guys. Forget about it.

01:31:59.907 --> 01:32:03.323
Say, how's Mrs Sline?

01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:05.403
I might have some information
she'd like to know.

01:32:10.417 --> 01:32:12.291
You blackmailing me?

01:32:12.377 --> 01:32:16.078
Ifyou wanna put it that way.

01:32:16.173 --> 01:32:17.750
We're on a mission from God.

01:32:21.178 --> 01:32:24.178
Get us the hall, and I guarantee
we'll pack them in for miles around.

01:32:24.264 --> 01:32:26.007

01:32:27.809 --> 01:32:29.718
Okay. I'll get you the Palace Hotel.

01:32:31.146 --> 01:32:33.981

01:32:34.065 --> 01:32:38.015

01:32:39.445 --> 01:32:41.568

01:32:57.713 --> 01:33:00.204
And I used to sing to them,
just like with you.

01:33:00.299 --> 01:33:03.999

01:35:42.288 --> 01:35:44.162
What is it?

01:35:44.248 --> 01:35:46.537
We're out of gas.

01:35:47.627 --> 01:35:50.378
Oh, shit.

01:36:13.193 --> 01:36:16.028
Wow! A classic. What a room!

01:36:16.112 --> 01:36:17.690
This place is gonna swing tonight.

01:36:17.781 --> 01:36:19.654
It's a fucking barn.
We'll never fii ll it.

01:36:19.741 --> 01:36:22.232
We've gotta fii ll this hall tonight.

01:36:22.327 --> 01:36:24.366
A lot ofyoung children

01:36:24.454 --> 01:36:26.779
Young children?

01:36:26.873 --> 01:36:30.740
Jake and Elwood are donating

Nope. I said ''we're'' out of gas.

01:36:44.181 --> 01:36:47.099
Tanker truck's late.
Should have been here two hours ago.

01:36:47.184 --> 01:36:50.304
It's always late on Thursdays.

01:36:50.396 --> 01:36:54.227
I guess we'll have to wait.

01:37:18.423 --> 01:37:20.332
Excuse me, sir.

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:26.127

No. I'm in kind ofa hurry.

01:37:47.826 --> 01:37:49.653
Where in the hell are they?

01:37:49.744 --> 01:37:54.287
So maybe you'd like to come by
and see the show.

01:37:54.374 --> 01:37:58.372
I'm awfully sorry, but I do have
a prior dinner engagement.

01:38:06.803 --> 01:38:08.510
Thanks, Marvin.

01:38:13.017 --> 01:38:15.259
Get me Troopers Daniel and Mount.

01:38:22.609 --> 01:38:24.353
I don't see those Blues Brothers.

01:38:25.279 --> 01:38:26.524
We'll wait.

01:38:28.782 --> 01:38:31.154
Okay, you're all set.

01:38:31.243 --> 01:38:35.371
That'll be $94.

01:38:37.999 --> 01:38:39.659
Here's 95.
Thankyou.

01:38:39.751 --> 01:38:42.954
Okay. And that's a dollar change.

01:38:43.046 --> 01:38:46.664
- Oh, keep the change.
- Thanks.

01:38:48.509 --> 01:38:51.925
So, look. Ifyour date...

01:38:52.013 --> 01:38:54.504
don't work out tonight
for any reason...

01:38:54.599 --> 01:38:58.892
there's a motel
up on the interstate.

01:38:58.978 --> 01:39:02.892
Maybe we could, say, meet...

01:39:02.982 --> 01:39:05.733
around midnight?

01:39:07.152 --> 01:39:09.228
I'll think about it, Elwood, okay?

01:39:11.448 --> 01:39:13.108
Bye.

01:39:27.213 --> 01:39:29.087
Son ofa bitch!

01:39:30.258 --> 01:39:32.167
Come on!

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.789
We're really late.
You'd better step on it.

01:40:16.928 --> 01:40:20.012
I always like to perform
for angry mobs.

01:40:20.098 --> 01:40:21.640
You can't quit now.

01:40:21.724 --> 01:40:23.218
What can they be doing?

01:40:41.076 --> 01:40:42.985
My head hurts.

01:40:44.079 --> 01:40:45.823
That Night Train's a mean wine.

01:40:45.914 --> 01:40:47.823
You'd better get bright!
We got a show to do.

01:40:47.916 --> 01:40:50.324
Then we gotta fii gure out
some way to collect that gate money...

01:40:50.419 --> 01:40:54.630
get it to the County Assessor's offiice
as soon as they open in the morning.

01:41:02.931 --> 01:41:04.840
We want the show!

01:41:15.193 --> 01:41:17.766
Gentlemen, I'm leaving.

01:41:18.779 --> 01:41:20.190
Man, we were so close.

01:41:20.281 --> 01:41:22.357
Hey, you guys know
''Minnie The Moocher''?

01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:24.775
I knew a hooker once
named Minnie Mazola.

01:41:24.869 --> 01:41:27.324
No! The song ''Minnie the Moocher.''

01:41:27.413 --> 01:41:29.820
- Yeah. So what?
- Hit it!

01:41:59.777 --> 01:42:05.815
Hey, folks, here's a story
'bout Minnie the Moocher

01:42:05.908 --> 01:42:10.736
She wasa low-down hoochie coocher

01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:14.744
She was the roughest, toughest frail

01:42:14.833 --> 01:42:17.503
But Minnie hada heart

01:42:17.586 --> 01:42:19.495
Asbig asa whale

01:42:39.941 --> 01:42:44.733
She messedaround

01:42:44.821 --> 01:42:48.486
She lovedhim

01:42:49.784 --> 01:42:52.820

This is glue. Strong stuff.

01:45:06.708 --> 01:45:08.581
What the hell are you doing?

01:45:08.668 --> 01:45:10.956
This can is from
a surplus disposal run.

01:45:11.045 --> 01:45:14.046
Fifteen overcharged ounces
of pure, uncompounded...

01:45:14.131 --> 01:45:16.918
isopropyl butane monosulfate.

01:45:17.009 --> 01:45:19.298
When combined with oxygen
and a little heat...

01:45:19.386 --> 01:45:21.628
it will cause a rapid expansion.

01:45:48.998 --> 01:45:52.201
PoorMin, poorMin

01:46:35.877 --> 01:46:37.834
- Let's take them!
- Wait a minute.

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:41.752
I've never even heard
these boys sing, all right?

01:46:41.841 --> 01:46:43.668
All right.

01:46:43.759 --> 01:46:45.966
They're not going no place.

01:46:46.053 --> 01:46:48.805
All right, cover all exits! Let's go!
Come on! Hurry up!

01:46:51.809 --> 01:46:54.430

01:55:22.551 --> 01:55:24.378

Yeah. Sure, it's a deal!

01:55:42.404 --> 01:55:45.191
Listen, all these cops out here--
they're waiting for us.

01:55:45.282 --> 01:55:48.615
We gotta get out with nobody
seeing us. You know a back door out?

01:55:48.702 --> 01:55:51.786
Sure. I used to be head bouncer here
back in the '70s.

01:55:51.871 --> 01:55:55.655
There's an electrical service duct
behind your drummer's riser.

01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:57.743
Do us a favour.

01:55:57.835 --> 01:56:01.002
Take $1 ,400 and give it
to Ray's Music Exchange...

01:56:01.089 --> 01:56:03.924

01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:07.633

Me and Elwood are gonna make a break
for it. You and the band keep playing.

01:56:45.423 --> 01:56:49.041
- Something's wrong.

01:56:52.638 --> 01:56:54.263
Where'd they go?

01:57:07.444 --> 01:57:09.852
I sure hope this thing
leads someplace.

01:57:09.947 --> 01:57:12.616
Elwood, we're gone, man.

01:57:20.957 --> 01:57:23.531
Who is that girl?

01:57:23.626 --> 01:57:25.915
Well,Jake.

01:57:26.004 --> 01:57:28.874
You lookjust fii ne down there...

01:57:28.965 --> 01:57:31.123
slithering in the mud
like vermin.

01:57:31.217 --> 01:57:33.126
No problem.

01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:36.378
You're not gonna get away from me
this time.

01:57:41.811 --> 01:57:43.305
Check that out! Let's go!

01:58:02.956 --> 01:58:05.661
It's good to see you,
sweetheart!

01:58:06.751 --> 01:58:08.744
You contemptible pig.

01:58:10.505 --> 01:58:13.838
I remained celibate foryou.

01:58:13.925 --> 01:58:16.712
I stood at the back
ofa cathedral...

01:58:16.803 --> 01:58:19.294
waiting, in celibacy, foryou...

01:58:19.389 --> 01:58:23.007
with 300 friends and relatives
in attendance.

01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:26.350
My uncle hired the best
Rumanian caterers in the state.

01:58:26.437 --> 01:58:28.845
To obtain the seven limousines...

01:58:28.939 --> 01:58:32.225
my father used up his last favours
with Mad Pete Trullo.

01:58:33.277 --> 01:58:36.194
So for me, for my mother...

01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:40.324
my grandmother, my father,
my uncle and for the common good...

01:58:40.409 --> 01:58:43.778
I must now kill you
and your brother.

01:58:57.300 --> 01:59:00.336
Oh, please don't kill us!

01:59:02.138 --> 01:59:06.052
You know I love you, baby! I wouldn't
leave you! It wasn't my fault!

01:59:06.142 --> 01:59:08.016
You miserable slug!

01:59:08.102 --> 01:59:11.553
You thinkyou can talkyour way
out ofthis? You betrayed me!

01:59:11.647 --> 01:59:14.565
No, I didn't. Honest!

01:59:14.650 --> 01:59:16.559
I ran out of gas!

01:59:16.652 --> 01:59:19.772
I had a flat tyre!
I didn't have money for cab fare!

01:59:19.864 --> 01:59:21.903
My tux didn't come back
from the cleaners.

01:59:21.991 --> 01:59:23.817
And old friend came in
from out oftown!

01:59:23.909 --> 01:59:28.322
Someone stole my car! There was
an earthquake! A terrible flood!

01:59:28.413 --> 01:59:33.408
Locusts! It wasn't my fault,
I swear to God!

01:59:56.065 --> 01:59:58.022
Jake, honey.

02:00:10.954 --> 02:00:12.947
Let's go.

02:00:15.792 --> 02:00:17.666
Take it easy.

02:00:33.143 --> 02:00:35.182
You're now going to
totally demolish that car.

02:00:38.273 --> 02:00:42.436
You want to maybe consider
going after the Blues Brothers?

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:55.070
It's 1 06 miles to Chicago.

02:00:55.164 --> 02:00:57.999

02:00:58.083 --> 02:01:00.835

02:01:00.919 --> 02:01:01.833
Hit it.

02:01:45.879 --> 02:01:49.462
Shit, man. Can't this damn thing
go any faster than this?

02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:51.875
Bob, I think I've got
a little problem.

02:01:54.554 --> 02:01:56.464
Goddam, boy.

02:02:20.413 --> 02:02:21.823

the Honourable Richard J. Daley Plaza.

02:06:11.093 --> 02:06:13.763
