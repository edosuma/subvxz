<i>Previously on
"I'm Dying Up Here"...</i>

00:06.556 --> 00:07.223
Tourists?

00:07.224 --> 00:09.308
Comics. From Boston.

00:10.643 --> 00:11.060
What do you think of the place?

00:11.061 --> 00:13.312
We'll take it.

00:13.313 --> 00:14.855
And listen, this is the
closet to my room out here.

00:14.856 --> 00:15.648
So, if I'm in there with Maggie...

00:15.649 --> 00:17.691
- Who's Maggie?
- She's my girl.

00:17.692 --> 00:18.775
By the way, hands off.

00:18.776 --> 00:22.321
Took my kids to the circus,
the Mexican circus.

00:23.906 --> 00:24.782
You know who Edmund Hillary is?

00:24.783 --> 00:27.159
He risked everything
to reach the summit,

00:27.160 --> 00:29.911
and when he finally stood
on top of the world,

00:29.912 --> 00:31.621
<i>do you know how long it was for?</i>

00:31.622 --> 00:34.791
<i>Fifteen minutes.</i>

00:34.792 --> 00:36.251
Guys, I'm trying to hear Clay.

00:36.252 --> 00:38.253
- <i>Come on over.</i>
- He got the couch.

00:38.254 --> 00:40.505
I'm jealous. Every Merv, Johnny,

00:40.506 --> 00:41.590
or Dinah fucking Shore appearance

00:41.591 --> 00:44.551
another comic makes is one
more that we didn't get.

00:44.552 --> 00:46.219
That's a motherfucking

00:46.220 --> 00:46.971
2:30 in the morning pancake
speech right there.

00:46.972 --> 00:50.807
Fuck you, and fuck you.

00:50.808 --> 00:52.434
<i>Without you even realizing it,</i>

00:52.435 --> 00:55.645
life just bends you over and
tucks it straight up your ass.

00:55.646 --> 00:56.897
Johnny feels bad, but
I just think we need

00:56.898 --> 00:58.023
to book some more established
comics for a little while,

00:58.024 --> 01:00.400
see how it all shakes out.

01:00.401 --> 01:02.652
I been doing open mic for
over a fucking year now.

01:02.653 --> 01:05.322
You want Carson? You got to
mingle for Christ's sake.

01:05.322 --> 01:06.823
I said I know who you are.

01:06.824 --> 01:07.866
Why don't you quit while
you're ahead, huh?

01:07.867 --> 01:09.910
Think I should
try to book a church?

01:09.911 --> 01:13.373
Fuck, no. We're in one.

<i>All right, thank you, folks.</i>

02:04.841 --> 02:06.174
<i>You've been a...</i>

02:06.175 --> 02:08.175
<i>slightly above average crowd.</i>

02:27.155 --> 02:28.280
This room is toast.

02:40.710 --> 02:41.252
Yeah.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.891
Ooh.

02:55.892 --> 02:58.351
My fellow Americans,

02:58.352 --> 03:03.690
let's make one thing perfectly clear.

03:03.691 --> 03:06.193
His sister was so ugly

03:06.194 --> 03:08.904
people went out on Halloween,

03:08.905 --> 03:09.946
dressed as her.

03:14.368 --> 03:17.954
That was Nixon
insulting my sister.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.665
Hey. You cutting it close.

03:20.666 --> 03:21.917
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Come on.

03:25.421 --> 03:27.130
Anybody here like magic?

03:27.131 --> 03:29.132
Oh... oh, my time's up.

03:31.469 --> 03:33.428
Thank you, Mr. President.

03:33.429 --> 03:34.305
Come on.

03:34.306 --> 03:36.139
All right, coming to the stage next,

03:36.140 --> 03:39.059
a regular here at the open mic,

03:39.060 --> 03:40.101
give it up for Mr. Adam Proteau.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.567
- Twinkle.
- Mm.

03:49.111 --> 03:50.111
Whoo!

03:53.533 --> 03:57.702
Yes, that's right, I am
a professional amateur.

03:59.247 --> 04:01.831
I used to do a lot of
handyman work growing up,

04:01.832 --> 04:04.876
mostly because my dad
was in the business...

04:04.877 --> 04:06.586
of breaking shit.

04:08.130 --> 04:09.965
"What the hell's wrong
with this toaster?"

04:09.966 --> 04:11.633
Well, Dad, did you try to plug it in

04:11.634 --> 04:13.260
before you threw it against the wall?

04:13.261 --> 04:14.970
It's just a question. It's just a...

04:17.598 --> 04:19.975
Where the fuck did you
get another toaster?

04:21.685 --> 04:23.436
Like, my dad used to break everything,

04:23.437 --> 04:25.814
not just normal stuff, everything...

04:25.815 --> 04:27.274
appliances,

04:27.275 --> 04:28.817
TVs,

04:28.818 --> 04:29.943
laws.

04:31.946 --> 04:32.905
But it's okay, you know,

04:32.906 --> 04:35.323
'cause now I know how to fix everything.

04:35.324 --> 04:37.534
How to fix a door that's been kicked in.

04:37.535 --> 04:39.703
I can plaster up a hole that's
been punched into a wall.

04:39.704 --> 04:40.621
Fix a pane of glass that my head

04:40.622 --> 04:42.998
may or may not have been pushed through.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.543
One thing I can't fix

04:46.544 --> 04:48.003
is the relationship with my dad.

04:49.380 --> 04:52.382
Hey! How about a shine, my brotha?

04:54.677 --> 04:56.678
"How about a shine"?

04:56.679 --> 04:58.179
Okay, are we talking about
your shoes or your dick, sir?

05:00.474 --> 05:02.851
Your mama
took care of my dick.

05:02.852 --> 05:04.561
I gave her 50 cents.

05:04.562 --> 05:06.897
Well, seeing as how she only
charges 25 cents an inch,

05:06.898 --> 05:10.191
I wouldn't scream out that dumb
shit too proudly, you know?

05:10.192 --> 05:12.944
Now, if your mama sucked my dick

05:12.945 --> 05:15.363
for 25 cent an inch,
she'd have enough money

05:15.364 --> 05:16.364
to send your ass to Yale, Harvard,

05:16.365 --> 05:18.992
and Shut The Fuck Up School,

05:18.993 --> 05:21.119
which is on the corner
of I Need To Be Noticed

05:21.120 --> 05:23.204
and My Date Thinks I'm An Asshole.

05:25.207 --> 05:27.125
Fucking dick.

05:29.045 --> 05:31.631
Hey, you can't let 'em get to you.

05:33.049 --> 05:34.424
This is seven-card stud.

05:34.425 --> 05:36.426
Low spade in the hole splits the pot.

05:41.807 --> 05:43.683
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

05:43.684 --> 05:45.894
Shit, and <i>shit!</i>

05:45.895 --> 05:49.105
Jesus, is this a game
of chance or no chance?

05:49.106 --> 05:50.231
Don't let the sun catch
you crying, baby.

05:50.232 --> 05:52.692
Mm-hmm.

05:52.693 --> 05:55.236
So I heard Johnny had
Rickles on the other night.

05:55.237 --> 05:56.571
That's fresh.

05:56.572 --> 05:58.448
Oh, Christ, don't get her riled.

05:58.449 --> 06:00.742
Get me riled? What? I love Don.

06:00.743 --> 06:02.327
Yeah, doesn't exactly
sound like all the calls

06:02.328 --> 06:04.120
I've been getting from you lately.

06:04.121 --> 06:05.455
You say don't get her started,
then you get her started.

06:05.456 --> 06:07.666
Come on, R-Rickles, Hackett,

06:07.667 --> 06:10.251
Professor Irwin Corey, I love 'em.

06:10.252 --> 06:13.588
But you can't get any
more "dog bites man" than that.

06:13.589 --> 06:16.383
I told you. We're
bringing the kids back.

06:16.384 --> 06:17.842
Oh, papers cleared
Clay over a month ago.

06:17.843 --> 06:21.346
Be nice if you guys could keep
up with yesterday's news.

06:21.347 --> 06:24.516
We just need to leave the
window open a little longer.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.767
Send 'em our way.

06:25.768 --> 06:27.602
We love the kids at <i>Midnight Special.</i>

06:27.603 --> 06:29.396
I tried calling your producer...
Butterman.

06:29.397 --> 06:31.606
Yeah, said he can't be reached.

06:31.607 --> 06:33.066
He's fly-fishing, for two months.

06:35.069 --> 06:36.028
We're fly-fishing now?

06:36.029 --> 06:38.947
I think it's a euphemism
for invading Syria.

06:38.948 --> 06:41.533
Thank you for making the
world right side up again.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.034
Whatever it's a euphemism for,

06:43.035 --> 06:45.161
I'm having lunch with
him tomorrow at noon.

06:45.162 --> 06:47.122
Expect a call around one.

06:47.123 --> 06:49.249
Well...

06:49.250 --> 06:51.126
just for that, Bob,
I'm gonna tell you...

06:51.127 --> 06:53.712
Mitch here has a pair of aces.

06:55.131 --> 06:57.173
You're a real asshole, Goldie.

06:57.174 --> 06:59.801
What, it's my fault you got
the wingspan of a condor?

07:01.220 --> 07:04.765
Hold your cards closer to
your vest next time, huh?

07:08.144 --> 07:10.186
What's up, my man?

07:13.149 --> 07:15.734
Mm.

07:15.735 --> 07:18.153
No, I wouldn't want your job,

07:18.154 --> 07:21.532
not for all the bananas in China.

07:22.491 --> 07:24.826
My girlfriend dragged me here.

07:24.827 --> 07:30.331
Some douchebag at her office
thinks he's Rich Little.

07:30.332 --> 07:31.416
Got to cut these guys some slack, man.

07:31.417 --> 07:35.003
It's open mic, all newbies.

07:35.004 --> 07:36.171
No shit?

07:36.172 --> 07:38.673
Good thing I'm here.

07:38.674 --> 07:42.093
Liven this motherfucker up.

07:42.094 --> 07:43.553
It's hard.

07:43.554 --> 07:46.097
You know, comedy's all about timing,

07:46.098 --> 07:47.974
which takes a while to learn.

07:47.975 --> 07:50.018
Bullshit.

07:50.019 --> 07:51.352
You're either funny,

07:51.353 --> 07:53.146
or you're not.

07:53.147 --> 07:55.815
Now, Bill Cosby...

07:55.816 --> 07:56.983
he's a funny spook.

07:56.984 --> 07:58.860
Yeah.

07:58.861 --> 08:00.195
But that spook got funny

08:00.196 --> 08:03.156
by learning timing.

08:03.157 --> 08:05.700
Know your audience!

08:05.701 --> 08:07.535
Know when to wait for a laugh.

08:07.536 --> 08:12.791
Timing is motherfucking everything!

08:13.758 --> 08:15.543
Now, see?

08:15.544 --> 08:18.087
Half hour ago, this wouldn't
have been funny to me.

08:18.088 --> 08:20.381
But now it's motherfucking hysterical.

08:22.968 --> 08:23.803
Hey, floor's wet.

08:28.182 --> 08:30.225
Hey. You want to buy some weed?

09:06.220 --> 09:06.929
Tweety?

09:26.657 --> 09:28.283
All right, let me hear it.

09:28.284 --> 09:29.617
Hear what?

09:29.618 --> 09:32.287
You only smile like that

09:32.288 --> 09:35.165
over brownies, blow jobs, or a new bit.

09:35.166 --> 09:38.960
And since we're all out of
brownies and blow jobs...

09:38.961 --> 09:41.462
Why are we always running
out of blow jobs?

09:41.463 --> 09:42.547
Why can't we run out of
Wheat Thins or yogurt?

09:42.548 --> 09:44.299
It's always stuff that I like.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.969
Joke, please.

09:47.970 --> 09:50.054
You know that Picasso just died, right?

09:50.055 --> 09:52.390
Good.

09:52.391 --> 09:53.850
What do you got against Picasso?

09:53.851 --> 09:56.144
Four of the women he was with...

09:56.145 --> 09:56.770
two committed suicide,

09:56.771 --> 09:58.605
and two he drove insane.

09:58.606 --> 10:00.356
So you're saying the guy has a type.

10:00.357 --> 10:02.901
Can I continue?

10:02.902 --> 10:03.736
So I'm reading Pablo's obit.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.486
You know, the guy's a famous artist.

10:05.487 --> 10:08.323
He's got nothing to prove,

10:08.324 --> 10:10.325
except, apparently, how
much pussy he got.

10:10.326 --> 10:11.743
Listen to this.

10:11.744 --> 10:15.705
"Picasso, 91, died in a villa in France

10:15.706 --> 10:17.498
and leaves behind a wife
almost half his age."

10:17.499 --> 10:19.834
Okay, you've got my attention.

10:19.835 --> 10:22.295
"In addition to his wife,
he leaves four children...

10:22.296 --> 10:24.130
one son born to his first wife,

10:24.131 --> 10:26.007
the dancer Olga Khokhlova."

10:26.008 --> 10:28.092
Not just <i>a</i> dancer, <i>the</i> dancer.

10:28.093 --> 10:29.344
Right?

10:29.345 --> 10:30.511
"And daughter born to his mistress,

10:30.512 --> 10:32.013
Marie-Thérèse Walter."

10:32.014 --> 10:34.015
Since when have mistresses
been put in obits?

10:34.016 --> 10:36.893
"And another son and
daughter both the children

10:36.894 --> 10:38.853
of Françoise Gilot, another mistress,"

10:38.854 --> 10:41.648
for those of you keeping score at home,

10:41.649 --> 10:46.402
"who is now the wife of biologist Dr.
Jonas Salk."

10:46.403 --> 10:48.529
Fuck you, Jonas Salk.

10:48.530 --> 10:51.324
You cured polio? I fucked your wife.

10:51.325 --> 10:52.201
That's not an obit.

10:52.202 --> 10:54.244
That's a press release for his dick.

11:01.877 --> 11:05.755
It's nice having a
comedian as a girlfriend.

11:13.889 --> 11:16.266
You've never called me that before.

11:18.435 --> 11:22.272
Is that what this is?

11:22.273 --> 11:24.148
I mean, "two people who
fuck intermittently"

11:24.149 --> 11:25.733
just sounds so long.

11:25.734 --> 11:26.485
Plus, we've been dating for four months.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.903
Oh, "dating," wow.

11:28.904 --> 11:31.364
Well, you're just giving
away labels today.

11:31.365 --> 11:32.740
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:32.741 --> 11:36.077
the downside of having a
comedian as a girlfriend.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.414
Hey!

11:39.415 --> 11:40.581
Hey!

11:40.582 --> 11:42.458
Jesus fucking Christ!

11:44.670 --> 11:46.004
Come on!

11:49.300 --> 11:51.259
Hey, hey!

11:51.260 --> 11:52.760
This is my laundry.

11:52.761 --> 11:53.761
Asshole! Men's clothes!

11:53.762 --> 11:55.388
So, unless there's a Mr. Prostitute,

11:55.389 --> 11:58.266
you can go fuck...

11:58.267 --> 11:59.267
For fuck's sake.

11:59.268 --> 12:00.435
Give me the fucking bag back.

12:00.436 --> 12:01.477
All right, all right. Help! Help!

12:01.478 --> 12:02.770
She's got a fucking knife!

12:02.771 --> 12:05.148
She's got a fucking knife! Fuck!

12:05.149 --> 12:05.899
Fuck!

12:08.068 --> 12:10.278
F... all right, just take it!
Fucking take it!

12:14.825 --> 12:16.075
Shit.

12:16.076 --> 12:17.577
Oh, you motherfucker.

12:17.578 --> 12:19.954
Hey, big guy, get her!

12:19.955 --> 12:22.290
Hey! Come on!

12:28.464 --> 12:31.632
Why are these wet?

12:31.633 --> 12:33.634
I didn't have enough quarters.

12:33.635 --> 12:35.887
What'd you get us for lunch?

12:38.849 --> 12:40.183
Space food sticks?

12:40.184 --> 12:42.393
The clerk was watching me like a hawk.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.604
Was it retarded Ringo Starr?

12:44.605 --> 12:47.273
No, it was the Asian
guy with the mustache

12:47.274 --> 12:49.317
that looks like a 12-year-old's pussy.

12:49.318 --> 12:50.651
We're lucky I got these.

12:50.652 --> 12:53.488
Hey, in zero gravity,

12:53.489 --> 12:56.366
would this or would this not
look like a floating turd?

12:56.367 --> 12:58.284
Really?

12:58.285 --> 13:00.203
You're gonna ruin my appetite
for the only food we have?

13:00.204 --> 13:01.871
Hey, I know what will cheer you up.

13:01.872 --> 13:04.332
We got 34 bucks, and
rent's due next week.

13:04.333 --> 13:07.293
Fuck!

13:07.294 --> 13:09.921
My parents are gonna be so
pissed if I ask for more money.

13:09.922 --> 13:13.049
Well, if your mom had blown your dad

13:13.050 --> 13:14.509
instead of fucking him the
night you were conceived,

13:14.510 --> 13:15.551
they wouldn't be in this mess,

13:15.552 --> 13:18.137
so maybe look in the mirror, Mr.
and Mrs. Zeidel.

13:18.138 --> 13:21.933
Mm, can you please not talk
about my mother giving head?

13:21.934 --> 13:25.520
Yeah, but you just made it
the elephant in the room.

13:27.189 --> 13:29.941
You should be
cleaning the toilets, Edgar.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.068
Since when did <i>Midnight Special</i>
start doing showcases?

13:32.069 --> 13:34.153
Since I got a producer to come and see

13:34.154 --> 13:37.240
if one of you assholes is ready
for national television.

13:37.241 --> 13:41.536
Kay, no food in the audience
during the showcase, huh?

13:41.537 --> 13:42.870
How drunk do you want 'em?

13:42.871 --> 13:44.497
I want them focused on the comics,

13:44.498 --> 13:47.417
not whether or not their
cheese sticks are hot enough.

13:55.008 --> 13:55.968
What the fuck?

13:55.969 --> 13:59.387
This is it? These are the times?

13:59.388 --> 14:00.513
Is there a problem?

14:00.514 --> 14:01.431
Yeah, why you got me going first?

14:01.432 --> 14:02.974
I got to compete with the drink orders.

14:02.975 --> 14:04.600
I'd rather open than close.

14:04.601 --> 14:06.227
You're not closing, you're headlining.

14:06.228 --> 14:08.020
Okay, that load of crap.
Let's call it what it is.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.439
I'm going last... I'm
like the guy sweeping up

14:10.440 --> 14:11.983
after the elephant at
the end of the parade.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.693
No, Gabe's going after Ralph.

14:13.694 --> 14:15.611
He's sweeping up after the elephant.

14:15.612 --> 14:16.988
Uh, Goldie,

14:16.989 --> 14:18.406
Uh-huh?

14:18.407 --> 14:19.949
Why am I, uh, not on the list?

14:19.950 --> 14:21.826
Sully, I need you to emcee.

14:21.827 --> 14:23.119
No, what? No. Come on,
that's total bullshit.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.620
You know I'm just as good as these guys.

14:24.621 --> 14:25.913
We've talked about this.

14:25.914 --> 14:28.916
You don't have a tight 15 yet.

14:28.917 --> 14:30.418
You're mostly crowd work.

14:30.419 --> 14:32.628
Uh, I can do a tight 15.

14:32.629 --> 14:35.882
I said "yet." I know you can,
and you will, just not now.

14:35.883 --> 14:38.301
- Are we done here?
- Uh, just one question.

14:38.302 --> 14:40.595
Do Gabe and I have to blow Bill, too,

14:40.596 --> 14:41.596
or just set the stage for him?

14:41.597 --> 14:42.222
Your meaning?

14:42.223 --> 14:44.265
Meaning, we warm him up,

14:44.266 --> 14:45.933
and Bill here reaps all the benefits.

14:45.934 --> 14:47.935
I don't have the best spot. Gabe does.

14:47.936 --> 14:49.353
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

14:49.354 --> 14:50.354
I got spot where everybody
goes to the bathroom

14:50.355 --> 14:52.440
because they don't got
food with their drinks.

14:52.441 --> 14:55.735
Hey, Gabe, that is not
how a bladder functions.

14:55.736 --> 14:56.445
Shut up, Edgar.

14:56.446 --> 14:58.154
I'm Jewish, you're Mexican,

14:58.155 --> 14:59.530
which automatically makes me closer

14:59.531 --> 15:00.573
to being a doctor than you.

15:00.574 --> 15:02.658
But if it's any consolation,
I will defer to you

15:02.659 --> 15:04.952
with any questions about selling
bags of oranges by the highway.

15:04.953 --> 15:06.454
Listen to you guys.

15:06.455 --> 15:09.749
You sound like a bunch of hens.
Shut the fuck up!

15:09.750 --> 15:11.959
If you don't like where you're placed,

15:11.960 --> 15:13.294
you know that Argus or Mule Deer

15:13.295 --> 15:17.298
would be happy to take
any one of those spots.

15:17.299 --> 15:20.843
We're just saying, shouldn't it
be some sort of pecking order

15:20.844 --> 15:22.595
based off time put in at the club?

15:22.596 --> 15:24.305
Oh, there is a pecking order.

15:24.306 --> 15:26.849
It goes me, you.

15:26.850 --> 15:27.975
You got your lineup, ladies. Out.

15:27.976 --> 15:30.728
That's some bullshit.

15:30.729 --> 15:33.773
Stop saying "we're just saying,"
when it's you just saying shit.

15:33.774 --> 15:35.691
Oh, like you like this lineup?

15:35.692 --> 15:38.319
Now, either all these guys
have the same handwriting,

15:38.320 --> 15:42.448
or somebody signing their
friends up for open mic.

15:42.449 --> 15:45.660
Wish I could find that guy and
tell him to sign me the fuck up.

15:45.661 --> 15:46.827
I was the exact same way.

15:46.828 --> 15:49.038
I was on that list every week

15:49.039 --> 15:50.248
and now look at me.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.541
I got the main room whenever I want it.

15:52.542 --> 15:54.794
As long as it's ten
minutes before closing.

15:54.795 --> 15:56.629
Yeah.

15:56.630 --> 15:58.130
Goldie wants to see you in her office.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.508
Wait, Goldie wants to see me? Why?

16:00.509 --> 16:02.677
She said something about
liking your shoes.

16:02.678 --> 16:04.303
My shoes?

16:04.304 --> 16:05.346
Wait. Really?

16:05.347 --> 16:06.223
Just go see her.

16:08.475 --> 16:09.684
Well, I feel like I'm going
to the principal's office

16:09.685 --> 16:11.894
or some shit now.

16:11.895 --> 16:13.396
Wish I had an apple to give her.

16:13.397 --> 16:15.648
Goldie doesn't get apples.
She gives them.

16:15.649 --> 16:16.899
Ooh, like Eve. Got it.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.693
Or the witch in <i>Snow White.</i>

16:18.694 --> 16:20.988
Pick your poison.

16:26.368 --> 16:27.535
Yep?

16:27.536 --> 16:29.620
Hey, you wanted to see me?

16:29.621 --> 16:31.248
Oh, hey, come in.

16:34.042 --> 16:37.545
Caught your
act the other night.

16:37.546 --> 16:41.173
Yeah?

16:41.174 --> 16:42.842
Funny.

16:42.843 --> 16:45.886
Thank you. I mean, it was a
rough night, but I thought...

16:45.887 --> 16:49.015
That handyman bit... is it true?

16:49.016 --> 16:50.391
Yeah.

16:50.392 --> 16:52.226
I mean, I think all the best comedy

16:52.227 --> 16:53.602
comes from a core of reality...

16:53.603 --> 16:54.479
That's great. I have some work for you

16:54.480 --> 16:57.816
at the the house if you're interested.

17:01.111 --> 17:04.155
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of... of course.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.239
Great.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.282
Monday morning, bright and early.

17:07.284 --> 17:09.160
Arnie'll give you the address.

17:09.161 --> 17:09.911
All right.

17:16.792 --> 17:18.461
So we need jobs

17:18.462 --> 17:21.756
if we're gonna keep enjoying
this extravagant lifestyle

17:21.757 --> 17:25.134
of living in a closet and
eating stolen snack food.

17:25.135 --> 17:27.428
Do you... do you know of anything

17:27.429 --> 17:30.097
or maybe something at your work or...?

17:30.098 --> 17:30.682
Mm...

17:30.683 --> 17:32.767
not really.

17:32.768 --> 17:33.685
No.

17:33.686 --> 17:37.730
Mm, I can keep my ears open, though.

17:37.731 --> 17:38.607
Where you...

17:38.608 --> 17:41.108
where do you work, again, exactly...

17:41.109 --> 17:43.235
that I would like to work also?

17:44.363 --> 17:46.906
Stefan Hatos-Monty Hall Productions...

17:46.907 --> 17:48.991
the people who do <i>Let's Make a Deal.</i>

17:48.992 --> 17:50.451
I'm an usher currently,

17:50.452 --> 17:53.579
but I'm hoping to one
day be a presenter.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.247
And what would that entail?

17:55.248 --> 17:58.584
So say that Monty is
telling a contestant

17:58.585 --> 17:59.378
that they won a refrigerator.

17:59.379 --> 18:02.129
When Jay is giving all the details,

18:02.130 --> 18:05.132
Carol Merrill, who is the
nicest person in real life,

18:05.133 --> 18:09.429
she presents the item, like so...

18:12.641 --> 18:13.058
What do you think?

18:13.059 --> 18:14.975
I think...

18:14.976 --> 18:15.811
I think you got to raise
your arms up higher,

18:15.812 --> 18:18.396
because the freezer...

18:18.397 --> 18:20.398
that's what people really care about.

18:20.399 --> 18:21.483
So like...?

18:23.652 --> 18:25.194
Perfect.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.994
Bill, what material you doing tonight?

18:33.995 --> 18:36.497
Why don't you watch me and see?

18:36.498 --> 18:37.998
I just think it sucks you
can't do your A stuff.

18:37.999 --> 18:40.835
The abortion bit kills,

18:40.836 --> 18:42.878
but, you know, TV, right?

18:42.879 --> 18:45.631
Not that I don't like your
family stuff, it's good.

18:45.632 --> 18:47.216
It's a solid B.

18:48.552 --> 18:51.721
Sully, is that what they're
wearing on the bench?

18:51.722 --> 18:53.848
Jesus.

18:56.184 --> 18:58.477
Gabe... let's go get stoned.

18:58.478 --> 19:00.062
Why the fuck would
I want to get stoned

19:00.063 --> 19:01.022
- before I go up?
- Whoa!

19:01.023 --> 19:03.649
No need to take my head off.

19:03.650 --> 19:04.317
I just know you're under
a lot of pressure,

19:04.318 --> 19:06.652
and I want to help you out.

19:06.653 --> 19:09.448
You know your shit does not play
well when you're like this.

19:10.907 --> 19:13.534
One fucking word, Edgar,

19:13.535 --> 19:17.705
and you'll be sipping your
next burrito through a straw.

19:17.706 --> 19:19.957
So Goldie wanted you to
come up to her house

19:19.958 --> 19:22.418
so you could do some handyman work?

19:22.419 --> 19:23.878
And I'm up here thinking she gonna

19:23.879 --> 19:24.920
give me The Cellar or some shit.

19:24.921 --> 19:26.338
- Right.
- Nope.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.048
Coo-coo-catchoo, Mrs. Jackie Robinson.

19:28.049 --> 19:30.217
Okay, it's not like that. Is it?

19:30.218 --> 19:32.470
Well, maybe it's like an audition.

19:32.471 --> 19:33.929
For your cock.

19:33.930 --> 19:34.723
No, she already said
you were funny, right?

19:34.724 --> 19:36.557
Now she's trying to see how funny.

19:36.558 --> 19:38.893
She's all buddy-buddy
with these shitheads.

19:38.894 --> 19:39.561
And maybe that's how she does it.

19:39.562 --> 19:41.395
- Go wow her.
- Mm.

19:41.396 --> 19:41.897
With your cock.

19:41.898 --> 19:43.856
What the fuck?

19:43.857 --> 19:44.899
Were you including me

19:44.900 --> 19:46.859
when you were talking
about those shitheads?

19:46.860 --> 19:49.236
Because, frankly, I would
love to be promoted

19:49.237 --> 19:50.905
from peon to shithead.

19:50.906 --> 19:53.574
Well, you know Goldie and I are
on a first-name basis now.

19:53.575 --> 19:54.950
Yeah.

19:54.951 --> 19:55.702
Of course, she thinks
that name is "Freddie."

19:55.703 --> 19:57.453
Wait. Your name isn't Freddie?

19:57.454 --> 19:59.413
Not to interrupt your
mutual attempts at banter,

19:59.414 --> 20:01.165
but there appears to be
a shithead in distress

20:01.166 --> 20:04.919
waving you over as we speak.

20:04.920 --> 20:08.756
Excuse me.

20:10.842 --> 20:11.802
Hey.

20:11.803 --> 20:14.094
Hi.

20:14.095 --> 20:15.513
I'm going with the Picasso bit.

20:15.514 --> 20:16.889
What? Why?

20:16.890 --> 20:17.599
Because Edgar said my
family shit is lame,

20:17.600 --> 20:19.850
and he's right... it is lame.

20:19.851 --> 20:21.227
And the Picasso bit is raw,
but that doesn't even matter.

20:21.228 --> 20:22.436
- Okay, stop...
- No, listen...

20:22.437 --> 20:23.521
- No. Stop.
- Listen...

20:23.522 --> 20:26.982
You know the only word I
heard you say was "Edgar."

20:26.983 --> 20:28.484
You know Edgar.

20:28.485 --> 20:30.861
He makes his living messing
with people's minds.

20:30.862 --> 20:32.988
The Picasso bit is gonna be great,

20:32.989 --> 20:34.448
but it's a work in progress,

20:34.449 --> 20:36.283
and you always kill
with your family stuff.

20:36.284 --> 20:39.412
And you're gonna kill it tonight.

20:42.999 --> 20:46.794
Fucking Edgar.

20:46.795 --> 20:47.920
You're right.

20:47.921 --> 20:52.967
It's nice having a
girlfriend who's a comedian.

20:52.968 --> 20:55.053
Hey, fuck off. Have a good set.

20:58.473 --> 21:00.641
I can't get used to the
size of things out here.

21:00.642 --> 21:03.352
I went to this Beverly
Hills public pool.

21:03.353 --> 21:05.938
Big pool, not crowded...

21:05.939 --> 21:06.981
also, not public.

21:10.068 --> 21:12.152
Turns out I was in
someone else's backyard.

21:12.153 --> 21:15.823
They had me arrested for trespassing.

21:15.824 --> 21:18.075
But where I'm from, if
you got a yard that big,

21:18.076 --> 21:20.494
you already in jail.

21:22.038 --> 21:23.247
You know, I admire the
Civil Rights movement.

21:23.248 --> 21:25.749
I don't know how they did it.

21:25.750 --> 21:28.586
You know, could you
imagine Jews rioting?

21:29.713 --> 21:31.839
Oh, all that fire, the heat.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.465
Ugh.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.175
Throw a couple German
Shepherds in there,

21:35.176 --> 21:37.469
not exactly a breed we gravitate to.

21:39.180 --> 21:41.307
Ugh, but protesting on the other hand.

21:41.308 --> 21:43.017
Protesting is something Jews
might actually excel at,

21:43.018 --> 21:45.477
because protesting...

21:45.478 --> 21:47.438
basically organized complaining.

21:48.357 --> 21:49.523
You know? What do we want?

21:49.524 --> 21:51.650
Freedom. When do we want it?

21:51.651 --> 21:53.694
I don't know. I'm just worried.

21:54.696 --> 21:56.322
I'm not married.

21:56.323 --> 21:57.948
I don't like the idea
of marriage, you know?

21:57.949 --> 22:00.159
I find the anniversary
gifts a real turnoff.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.036
First year, paper. Second year, cotton.

22:01.037 --> 22:03.370
Third year, leather.

22:03.371 --> 22:04.039
Sounds like a suicide kit.

22:05.373 --> 22:07.833
Paper to write the suicide note with.

22:07.834 --> 22:09.710
"Thanks for the cotton last year, honey,

22:09.711 --> 22:12.004
and this year for the belt
to hang myself with."

22:12.924 --> 22:15.382
I think we need to
update this list, right?

22:15.383 --> 22:17.551
First year, peace. Second year, quiet.

22:17.552 --> 22:19.845
Third year, fix me up with your sister.

22:21.097 --> 22:24.058
Don't fuck me on this intro.
Just keep it short and sweet.

22:24.059 --> 22:25.684
"Very funny man, Edgar Martinez."

22:25.685 --> 22:27.561
Yeah, I'm not really big
on lying to the public.

22:27.562 --> 22:28.896
Okay, just do what I ask,
and I'll do you the favor

22:28.897 --> 22:31.857
of swatting away all the pigs
that fly out of Goldie's ass

22:31.858 --> 22:33.859
- when you get your big break.
- That's my time.

22:33.860 --> 22:35.402
- Thank you guys so much.
- Douche.

22:37.781 --> 22:40.908
Bill Hobbs, ladies
and gentlemen, Bill Hobbs!

22:40.909 --> 22:43.327
Are you guys having a
good time tonight, huh?

22:43.328 --> 22:44.287
Whoo!

22:44.288 --> 22:46.121
Good, good, good, good!

22:46.122 --> 22:48.082
I know this guy is, 'cause,
wow, look at his date.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.250
She is gorgeous. And he is not.

22:50.251 --> 22:52.836
Whoo-ah! God, the power
of Christ compels you.

22:52.837 --> 22:54.380
Don't look straight into his eyes.

22:54.381 --> 22:55.756
When I look at this
couple, I-I feel that

22:55.757 --> 22:57.132
a short straw somehow
played a role in this.

22:57.133 --> 22:58.592
Did you lose a bet?

22:58.593 --> 23:01.553
Are you... are you... is
there a gun under the table?

23:01.554 --> 23:02.596
Guys, don't feel bad for her.
She charges by the pound.

23:02.597 --> 23:04.682
She's doing great.

23:04.683 --> 23:08.143
Is this your daughter, or...
or are you just rich?

23:08.144 --> 23:09.186
- Both.
- Both! Nice!

23:09.187 --> 23:11.355
Well, a follow-up question...
are you single?

23:11.356 --> 23:13.065
Because I'm looking for
a sugar daddy-in-law.

23:13.066 --> 23:15.025
Yeah? She's not answering.
She'll tell me later.

23:15.026 --> 23:15.735
All right, guys, let's move on.

23:15.736 --> 23:17.653
We have got a guy coming up.

23:17.654 --> 23:19.405
He is Mexican. That's his act.
Good night.

23:20.782 --> 23:22.074
No, I'm kidding, kidding.

23:22.075 --> 23:23.242
Seriously, uh, this guy is great.

23:23.243 --> 23:24.785
If life is a potluck, he
only brought the guacamole.

23:24.786 --> 23:26.954
He's straight out of the
mean streets of Brentwood,

23:26.955 --> 23:31.709
here to tell you how Mexicans
are different, Edgar Martinez!

23:32.545 --> 23:35.588
- You are a dead man.
- Blow me.

23:38.550 --> 23:39.134
Hey.

23:39.135 --> 23:42.136
We are.

23:42.137 --> 23:44.513
We are... we are different, right?

23:44.514 --> 23:47.182
For example, when
Mexicans go to the store,

23:47.183 --> 23:49.059
we bring the whole family.

23:51.396 --> 23:52.688
Uh...

23:52.689 --> 23:53.398
We want to br... buy
some cottage cheese,

23:53.399 --> 23:57.192
we put it up to a vote.

23:57.193 --> 23:58.819
And everybody can only get one thing,

23:58.820 --> 24:02.114
'cause we don't have
much room in the car.

24:02.115 --> 24:04.784
Right, everybody's holding one grape.

24:07.328 --> 24:09.204
Then we got to go back,

24:09.205 --> 24:11.623
get some more stuff.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.500
You don't do crowd work
during a showcase.

24:13.501 --> 24:15.002
Hey, hey, hey!

24:15.003 --> 24:17.296
Unwritten rule number
seven, written right here!

24:17.297 --> 24:18.297
I got laughs! You didn't!

24:18.298 --> 24:20.049
I should have had your
fucking spot, man!

24:20.050 --> 24:21.508
Yeah? Fucking insulting the comic

24:21.509 --> 24:23.844
you're bringing up, you motherfucker!

24:29.017 --> 24:30.059
Is this still a fight?

24:30.060 --> 24:32.144
It's starting to look
like how babies are made.

24:32.145 --> 24:33.187
Yeah, this was my shot.

24:33.188 --> 24:34.938
You never had a shot, Edgar! Ha ha!

24:34.939 --> 24:36.190
Because you fucked it up!

24:36.191 --> 24:38.859
Get the fuck off of him!

24:38.860 --> 24:40.069
What the...

24:40.070 --> 24:41.487
What the hell was that out there?

24:41.488 --> 24:42.238
I was just amping 'em up.

24:42.239 --> 24:44.323
More like fucking him up.

24:44.324 --> 24:46.200
Thank you, Goldie.

24:46.201 --> 24:48.327
D...

24:48.328 --> 24:49.745
Bill, Monday morning,

24:49.746 --> 24:52.206
Ten a. m. Butterman's office.

24:52.207 --> 24:54.333
Are you shitting me?

24:54.334 --> 24:57.044
Congratulations, Billy.

24:57.045 --> 24:57.962
Okay!

24:57.963 --> 25:00.214
Okay, all right. You two settle down.

25:00.215 --> 25:02.966
Holy shit. Holy shit.

25:02.967 --> 25:04.718
This isn't over, asshole.

25:04.719 --> 25:05.886
You punch like it's the
second day of your period.

25:05.887 --> 25:07.847
- Yeah, fuck you.
- Easy.

25:10.892 --> 25:12.267
Congratulations.

25:12.268 --> 25:13.685
Fucking...

25:13.686 --> 25:16.105
No.

25:29.577 --> 25:33.413
What, are you coming from church?

25:33.414 --> 25:36.250
N-no, no, no, I have a
T-shirt on under this.

25:36.251 --> 25:37.085
I just wasn't sure of what...

25:37.086 --> 25:40.879
The dress code?

25:40.880 --> 25:44.008
You're painting a room, not
taking it out to dinner.

25:48.429 --> 25:52.516
All this pink, I want it gone.

25:52.517 --> 25:54.101
We're going olive.

25:54.102 --> 25:56.270
My little sister's room used
to look just like this.

25:56.271 --> 25:59.940
My daughter's room.

25:59.941 --> 26:03.277
Little girls and pink.

26:03.278 --> 26:04.112
This is probably the first time, huh?

26:04.113 --> 26:05.904
What?

26:05.905 --> 26:08.949
I was just thinking that
it's probably the first time

26:08.950 --> 26:11.785
that a white woman has
ever wanted a black man

26:11.786 --> 26:14.247
in her daughter's bedroom.

26:18.251 --> 26:19.293
So your daughter likes olive now, huh?

26:19.294 --> 26:20.627
Hates it.

26:20.628 --> 26:23.297
You'll find what you need in the garage.

26:23.298 --> 26:24.840
Anything you want to eat, you
help yourself in the kitchen.

26:24.841 --> 26:27.260
I'll be down at the club, you need me.

26:34.517 --> 26:35.601
What do you think?

26:35.602 --> 26:38.645
Well, that depends.

26:38.646 --> 26:41.607
Are you going skiing or
gonna blow Dick Cavett?

26:41.608 --> 26:42.983
Oh, Dick and I were gonna ski first,

26:42.984 --> 26:43.651
but I do usually blow
him when we're done.

26:43.652 --> 26:45.694
Well, then you look great.

26:45.695 --> 26:47.070
So that's a no to the turtleneck.

26:47.071 --> 26:50.157
Well, actually, that's a
<i>fuck, no,</i> but I'm a lady.

26:50.158 --> 26:52.075
You still haven't told
me what Butterman said.

26:53.870 --> 26:55.662
"I saw your 15. Now do your best six.

26:55.663 --> 26:57.414
Buy a suit.

26:57.415 --> 26:58.999
You look like you play for
a women's softball team."

26:59.000 --> 27:00.876
And then some quick story
about how he one time

27:00.877 --> 27:02.669
saw Joni Mitchell peeing
outdoors while standing up.

27:02.670 --> 27:05.297
- Way to bury the lede.
- Mm.

27:05.298 --> 27:06.381
Also, Dionne Warwick is hosting.

27:06.382 --> 27:10.344
And apparently she finds
excessive eye contact crass.

27:10.345 --> 27:12.179
Well, I'm still very happy for you

27:12.180 --> 27:12.847
despite your many hurdles.

27:14.766 --> 27:17.559
My dad and my sister are coming out.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.019
Wow.

27:19.020 --> 27:22.314
I'm kind of excited to meet your dad.

27:22.315 --> 27:24.358
Yeah, I don't know why I told them.

27:24.359 --> 27:25.234
Because this is your moment,

27:25.235 --> 27:27.402
and you want the people that matter most

27:27.403 --> 27:29.696
to be there for you.

27:29.697 --> 27:31.698
Oh, you're gonna be there, huh?

27:31.699 --> 27:32.741
I'll think about it if you
lose that turtleneck.

27:32.742 --> 27:36.036
What you need is a groovy shirt.

27:38.206 --> 27:39.206
I'm gonna take the suit,

27:39.207 --> 27:42.584
but I'll need the
alterations done quickly.

27:42.585 --> 27:44.711
I got <i>Midnight Special.</i>

27:44.712 --> 27:47.047
Uh, the suit's not on special.

27:47.048 --> 27:48.382
Sorry.

27:48.383 --> 27:51.510
No, uh, it's a...

27:51.511 --> 27:52.387
it's a television show,
<i>Midnight Special.</i>

27:52.388 --> 27:54.429
I'm gonna be on it.

27:54.430 --> 27:57.349
Oh, I don't watch television.

27:57.350 --> 27:58.768
Right.

28:00.395 --> 28:02.646
I think we can just put it
on the... like, the cuff here.

28:02.647 --> 28:04.481
It has to make... be,
like, flashy, make noise.

28:04.482 --> 28:06.817
- It's itchy. It's itchy.
- Okay, this one you don't need.

28:06.818 --> 28:08.568
What, you got kin coming
up from Tennessee?

28:08.569 --> 28:10.612
No, dude, Maggie pulled some strings

28:10.613 --> 28:12.155
and got us on <i>Let's Make a Deal.</i>

28:12.156 --> 28:13.407
Jobs?

28:13.408 --> 28:14.325
Even better... contestants.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.410
- What?
- Yeah, and I got you costumes.

28:16.411 --> 28:17.911
People just leave them in the
Dumpster behind the studio.

28:17.912 --> 28:20.580
Yeah, you smell like
desperation and mouse urine.

28:20.581 --> 28:22.416
No, Z, this could be big, okay?

28:22.417 --> 28:24.334
We're on the trading floor. All
we got to do is get picked.

28:24.335 --> 28:25.211
Wait. We... we got to get picked?

28:25.212 --> 28:26.253
Yeah. Do you even watch the show?

28:26.254 --> 28:28.922
No.

28:28.923 --> 28:30.007
Well, then you don't know
how incredible this is.

28:30.008 --> 28:31.425
You could win a dining-room set

28:31.426 --> 28:33.260
or patio furniture.

28:33.261 --> 28:35.429
Oh, great.

28:35.430 --> 28:36.139
We can be comfortable while we starve.

28:36.140 --> 28:38.181
No, dude, a-anything we win,

28:38.182 --> 28:39.599
we're gonna sell and use to buy food.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.435
It's all about the cash value.

28:41.436 --> 28:43.311
Yeah, and don't forget to
bring a hard-boiled egg.

28:43.312 --> 28:44.312
What? Why?

28:44.313 --> 28:45.772
Because Monty's gonna ask
you for random shit,

28:45.773 --> 28:48.400
and then give you 50 bucks for it.

28:48.401 --> 28:51.361
And hard-boiled eggs are his go-to item.

28:51.362 --> 28:54.406
This is a fucking ridiculous plan.

28:55.491 --> 28:58.285
These people,
dressed as they are,

28:58.286 --> 29:01.955
come from all over the
United States to make deals.

29:01.956 --> 29:04.624
Here in the market place of America,

29:04.625 --> 29:08.420
<i>Let's Make a Deal!</i>

29:10.923 --> 29:15.469
And now here's
America's top trader,

29:15.470 --> 29:17.471
TV's big dealer,

29:17.472 --> 29:21.516
Monty Hall!

29:24.479 --> 29:26.646
Thank you.

29:26.647 --> 29:27.315
Me make-em big deal.

29:27.316 --> 29:29.816
Yay.

29:29.817 --> 29:31.568
I have some
reservations about this one...

29:31.569 --> 29:33.487
Unless you want space food
sticks for dinner, get excited.

29:33.488 --> 29:35.822
Monty only chooses excited people.

29:35.823 --> 29:36.865
Like I already don't hate myself enough.

29:36.866 --> 29:39.534
The yolk's on you, my friend.

29:39.535 --> 29:42.204
All right. Let's see.

29:42.205 --> 29:43.164
What do we have here?
What do we have here?

29:43.165 --> 29:47.459
What's that? "Not scared
to crow for a deal."

29:47.460 --> 29:48.919
I'm not, Monty.

29:48.920 --> 29:49.920
All right.

29:49.921 --> 29:51.505
Ron Shack. Good name.

29:51.506 --> 29:53.882
Uh, Ron Shack, will you crow for me?

29:53.883 --> 29:56.051
Caw, caw!

29:56.052 --> 29:57.469
Not bad. Come on.

29:58.846 --> 30:01.181
We just moved here from Boston.

30:01.182 --> 30:02.682
I mean, I'm originally from Tennessee,

30:02.683 --> 30:04.518
but we moved there when I was, like, 15.

30:04.519 --> 30:06.603
Okay, you and the... uh, the sunflower?

30:06.604 --> 30:08.188
No, no, he's...

30:08.189 --> 30:10.482
he was... the sunflower
was always from Boston.

30:10.483 --> 30:11.525
All right. And who do we have here?

30:11.526 --> 30:14.402
Uh, Eddie...

30:14.403 --> 30:15.529
Show him your thing.

30:15.530 --> 30:16.197
Uh, Eddie Zeidel. Is that correct?

30:16.198 --> 30:18.490
That's close enough, Monty!

30:18.491 --> 30:19.658
All right.

30:19.659 --> 30:20.368
Well, Ron and Eddie from Boston

30:20.369 --> 30:21.910
and formerly from Tennessee,

30:21.911 --> 30:23.787
do either of you have a hard-boiled egg?

30:23.788 --> 30:25.205
We do! We do, Monty.

30:25.206 --> 30:27.666
Give him the egg.

30:27.667 --> 30:29.709
I ate it. I ate it.

30:29.710 --> 30:31.128
What?

30:31.129 --> 30:33.839
I didn't think that was a real thing.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.882
Monty, we had an egg, I promise.

30:35.883 --> 30:37.425
I'm so sorry, but he ate it.

30:37.426 --> 30:38.677
All right, well...

30:38.678 --> 30:40.971
Well, don't worry because I
have something else planned.

30:40.972 --> 30:44.599
Jay, let's bring down the register.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.394
Thank you, Jay.

30:47.395 --> 30:49.563
Now, Ron, would you
like to push a button?

30:49.564 --> 30:50.564
Yes, absolutely, Monty!

30:51.899 --> 30:54.192
Whoo!

30:54.193 --> 30:55.819
Two hundred dollars!

30:55.820 --> 30:58.238
That's right, $200.

30:58.239 --> 31:01.032
What do we have here?

31:01.033 --> 31:02.492
One, two...

31:07.415 --> 31:09.583
Hey.

31:09.584 --> 31:11.835
You want this?

31:11.836 --> 31:15.338
Ah, no such thing as a
free lunch, my friend.

31:25.933 --> 31:27.684
I'm not too sure about what I'm eating,

31:27.685 --> 31:29.603
but it's good.

31:29.604 --> 31:33.064
It's liverwurst.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.482
I think that's what my
granddad died from.

31:39.697 --> 31:42.992
Because he... he used to drink and...

31:50.583 --> 31:52.459
So why do you have an empty birdcage?

31:52.460 --> 31:55.588
Bird died.

31:56.163 --> 31:56.839
Oh.

32:02.470 --> 32:05.972
Had it eight years.

32:05.973 --> 32:09.477
It was a birthday gift to
my daughter, for her ninth.

32:13.814 --> 32:16.816
So what did you do with it?

32:16.817 --> 32:18.485
What, the parakeet?

32:18.486 --> 32:19.903
Flushed it. What else
do you do with a dead bird?

32:19.904 --> 32:23.282
Right.

32:36.045 --> 32:39.005
So why are you painting
your daughter's room

32:39.006 --> 32:41.342
a color that she doesn't like?

32:43.511 --> 32:45.429
Not her room anymore.

32:51.060 --> 32:55.231
Did she go off to college or something?

33:11.372 --> 33:12.331
Hello?

33:14.041 --> 33:16.876
Do not tell me that
shit is still going on.

33:16.877 --> 33:19.045
Jesus Christ.

33:19.046 --> 33:22.173
I-I-I'll be right there.

33:22.174 --> 33:24.718
Fucking kids.

33:28.889 --> 33:31.516
Sully, you are telling me that Edgar

33:31.517 --> 33:33.977
had a bum shit in your car?

33:33.978 --> 33:36.688
One of the waitresses saw
Edgar literally open the door

33:36.689 --> 33:38.189
and allow the bum into my car!

33:38.190 --> 33:39.733
How does she know I
wasn't letting him out?

33:39.734 --> 33:41.067
- Shut up.
- Enough.

33:41.068 --> 33:43.653
Let's get to the bigger point.

33:43.654 --> 33:45.613
Why the fuck are you
involving me in this?

33:45.614 --> 33:46.490
Don't you think I have my
own shit to deal with?

33:46.491 --> 33:48.408
Well, it happened in your parking lot,

33:48.409 --> 33:49.909
so I assume it's under
your jurisdiction.

33:49.910 --> 33:51.077
Well, I think the burden
of proof is on Sully.

33:51.078 --> 33:53.872
I mean, I deny ever telling a bum

33:53.873 --> 33:55.665
to shit in his front seat.

33:55.666 --> 33:58.460
I am willing to agree
to the lesser charge

33:58.461 --> 34:01.755
of just feeding a bum
Dinty Moore Beef Stew

34:01.756 --> 34:02.797
and pointing him towards his car.

34:02.798 --> 34:04.966
This fucking guy! See? Right there?
He's saying it.

34:04.967 --> 34:06.343
That is enough. Stop.

34:06.344 --> 34:08.178
Sully, you brought this on yourself.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.346
Uh...

34:09.347 --> 34:09.972
"He's a Mexican, that's his act"

34:09.973 --> 34:12.891
is not an introduction.

34:12.891 --> 34:14.516
Edgar is a goddamn lunatic,

34:14.518 --> 34:15.768
- and you know it.
- Hey.

34:15.770 --> 34:16.645
What'd you think was gonna happen?

34:16.646 --> 34:20.023
- I'm the victim here!
- No, I am.

34:20.024 --> 34:22.775
And I don't want to hear
another word about this.

34:25.112 --> 34:26.362
Here's Ron and Eddie, Ron and Eddie.

34:26.364 --> 34:27.572
Yeah, Monty!

34:27.572 --> 34:29.783
Tell me, boys, do you
still have that $200,

34:29.784 --> 34:30.493
or did Eddie here eat it?

34:30.494 --> 34:32.284
No, no, no, we still have it.

34:32.286 --> 34:32.786
Yeah, no, I didn't eat that, Monty.

34:32.788 --> 34:35.121
All right.

34:35.121 --> 34:36.706
Well, would you like to
trade that 200 bucks for

34:36.706 --> 34:38.875
what's behind the curtain where
Carol Merrill is standing?

34:41.587 --> 34:43.463
Ron, we already have $200,

34:43.464 --> 34:44.922
and somebody just won a baby elephant,

34:44.924 --> 34:47.175
so let's just... let's just pack it in,

34:47.176 --> 34:48.301
call it a day.

34:48.302 --> 34:49.969
We'll take the curtain, Monty.

34:49.969 --> 34:52.389
All right, for Ron and
Eddie, what do we got?

34:54.725 --> 34:55.518
We have a billiard table.

34:55.518 --> 34:57.686
Jay?

34:57.687 --> 35:00.146
That's right. It's a
brand-new billiard table,

35:00.147 --> 35:02.232
featuring a burn-resistant
cloth surface,

35:02.233 --> 35:03.817
high-speed rubber cushions...

35:03.818 --> 35:05.568
Where are we putting that?

35:05.569 --> 35:06.986
Retail value.

35:06.987 --> 35:08.988
We sell that baby, we
can eat for months.

35:08.989 --> 35:11.783
Manufactured in
Costa Mesa, California,

35:11.784 --> 35:14.661
this beautiful billiard table retails

35:14.662 --> 35:17.831
for $1,895!

35:17.832 --> 35:21.876
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Yes.

35:21.877 --> 35:23.379
Yes! Yes!

35:28.134 --> 35:30.469
- I'll get that.
- Thanks.

35:32.513 --> 35:35.181
- You finally made it.
- Oh, you finally made it.

35:35.182 --> 35:36.641
This is big, Billy.

35:36.642 --> 35:38.518
Yeah, it's not <i>The Tonight Show,</i>

35:38.519 --> 35:39.186
but if Dionne Warwick's doing it,

35:39.187 --> 35:41.521
it's got to mean something.

35:41.522 --> 35:44.023
That's all Dad's been talking
about the whole trip...

35:44.024 --> 35:45.942
Dionne Warwick.

35:45.943 --> 35:47.694
She's a fine Negro singer, much
better than the other one.

35:47.695 --> 35:50.530
I promised I would get her
autograph for your mom,

35:50.531 --> 35:51.531
who sends her love, obviously.

35:51.532 --> 35:55.535
Yeah, uh, Cass, this is my dad, Warren,

35:55.536 --> 35:56.786
my sister, Susan.

35:56.787 --> 35:58.580
Hi, nice...
Nice to meet you both.

35:58.581 --> 36:00.039
Nice to finally meet you.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.791
Bill goes on and on
about you constantly.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.835
Is that so?

36:03.836 --> 36:05.628
It's not constantly.

36:05.629 --> 36:06.838
Bill...

36:06.839 --> 36:09.007
where are you manners?

36:09.008 --> 36:10.049
Uh, right, this is Sparky.

36:10.050 --> 36:12.260
And, uh, my dad brought
him, even though I told him

36:12.261 --> 36:14.053
my apartment doesn't allow pets.

36:14.054 --> 36:15.722
Well, hell, what, you didn't think

36:15.723 --> 36:17.056
he would come to Hollywood
to see his big-shot brother

36:17.057 --> 36:18.975
going up on the doodad show?

36:18.976 --> 36:21.352
He's not my brother.

36:21.353 --> 36:23.646
And it's, uh, <i>Midnight Special.</i>

36:23.647 --> 36:25.064
It's not the doodad show.

36:25.065 --> 36:26.900
Well, I actually just
wanted to come and say hi.

36:26.901 --> 36:29.235
But I got to get to Goldie's.

36:29.236 --> 36:31.029
You're leaving? I ordered
Chinese food for us.

36:31.030 --> 36:32.906
I know, but I'm going up tonight,

36:32.907 --> 36:35.450
and, you know, I got my three
pairs of jeans to go through...

36:35.451 --> 36:37.911
faded, really faded, and
practically obscene.

36:37.912 --> 36:40.872
Goldie's is the comedy
club where Bill practices.

36:40.873 --> 36:41.915
Performs.

36:41.916 --> 36:44.959
You a waitress, sweetie?

36:44.960 --> 36:47.045
I'm a comedian.

36:47.046 --> 36:48.087
Oh, I-I thought you were his girlfriend.

36:48.088 --> 36:51.424
She is. She's both.

36:51.425 --> 36:53.927
Well, can we come see you?

36:53.928 --> 36:55.428
I'm not on till really late.

36:55.429 --> 36:57.430
I don't... I don't get
the good time slots yet.

36:57.431 --> 36:59.432
I'm... I'm still working my
way up to where Bill is.

36:59.433 --> 37:01.392
Hmm. You sure that's the direction?

37:01.393 --> 37:03.603
Just busting
your grapes, Billy.

37:03.604 --> 37:06.606
Anyhow, it was
very nice to meet you both.

37:06.607 --> 37:07.982
Yeah, and we'll see you at the show...

37:07.983 --> 37:09.108
Bill's show, I mean.

37:09.109 --> 37:11.903
Yeah, the doodad show.

37:11.904 --> 37:13.571
Definitely.

37:13.572 --> 37:14.740
Bye.

37:18.452 --> 37:20.995
She seems like
a really sweet girl.

37:20.996 --> 37:24.333
I never had a Jew.

37:30.965 --> 37:34.467
Now, who wants to participate
in our Big Deal of the Day?

37:34.468 --> 37:36.845
Where you can trade in an earlier deal

37:36.846 --> 37:39.347
for a chance at a really big prize.

37:39.348 --> 37:40.849
Me! Me, Monty, me and Eddie!

37:40.850 --> 37:42.308
No, we're good! We're good, Monty!

37:42.309 --> 37:44.686
Hey, you, scarecrow, listen to me.

37:44.687 --> 37:46.145
We need to quit while we're ahead.

37:46.146 --> 37:47.146
We have a billiard table already.

37:47.147 --> 37:48.940
Let's just sell it and eat.

37:48.941 --> 37:50.316
Jeez, would you stop being such a pussy?

37:50.317 --> 37:52.986
I'm not being a pussy! I'm just...

37:52.987 --> 37:53.863
Why take the risk?

37:53.864 --> 37:56.406
Are you serious?

37:56.407 --> 37:58.157
We're out here because
we're taking a risk.

37:58.158 --> 38:00.368
I mean, every morning we get
up, everything we do...

38:00.369 --> 38:02.537
moving here was a fucking risk.

38:02.538 --> 38:04.330
I think that's a yes.

38:04.331 --> 38:06.291
You're right. Fuck it.

38:06.292 --> 38:09.043
Monty! Over here! Caw! Caw!

38:09.044 --> 38:10.336
Don't caw. You're a flower.

38:10.337 --> 38:11.796
You sound like a fucking idiot.

38:11.797 --> 38:13.339
She wants door number three.

38:13.340 --> 38:13.966
Let's see what's behind
door number three.

38:16.343 --> 38:17.552
A new car!

38:17.553 --> 38:20.013
Ride in style to
your next poker game

38:20.014 --> 38:23.182
in a brand-new Cadillac.

38:23.183 --> 38:24.601
This El Dorado's loaded
with all of Cadillac's

38:24.602 --> 38:28.855
famous power accessories,
plus air conditioning...

38:28.856 --> 38:30.523
the ultimate in luxury

38:30.524 --> 38:32.442
from Casa de Cadillac in
Sherman Oaks, California,

38:32.443 --> 38:33.819
with tax and license included.

38:33.820 --> 38:35.028
It sells for

38:35.029 --> 38:38.364
$10,413.

38:38.365 --> 38:40.867
Are you fucking kidding me?

38:42.369 --> 38:44.162
Monty! Over here, Monty!

38:44.163 --> 38:45.705
Pick us! Pick us!

38:45.706 --> 38:47.332
- Monty, we're ready.
- Pick us, Monty!

38:47.333 --> 38:48.250
- He loves us... Monty.
- I know, I see him, I see him.

38:48.251 --> 38:51.961
Ron and Eddie, Ron and Eddie.

38:51.962 --> 38:53.880
You guys have a billiard table worth

38:53.881 --> 38:57.842
$1,895.

39:00.095 --> 39:03.056
Which door do you choose?

39:03.057 --> 39:05.141
Two! Two!

39:05.142 --> 39:08.728
We want door number one.

39:08.729 --> 39:10.146
Okay, door number one...
let's see what's behind it.

39:12.483 --> 39:14.776
Oh.

39:14.777 --> 39:16.653
That's what happens when
you gamble at pool.

39:16.654 --> 39:19.739
Hey, guys,
your ride home is here.

39:21.325 --> 39:22.408
Say, Jay, just so they don't
go home empty-handed,

39:22.409 --> 39:24.744
what else do we have for them?

39:24.745 --> 39:28.539
Hee-haw, it's a year's
supply of Rice-A-Roni,

39:28.540 --> 39:31.125
the one you sauté and simmer
to flavor perfection.

39:31.126 --> 39:34.420
The San Francisco Treat!

39:34.421 --> 39:35.588
Yes.

39:35.589 --> 39:37.090
Yes! Yes! Yes!

39:37.091 --> 39:37.758
Yes!

39:40.928 --> 39:42.929
We did it.

39:42.930 --> 39:44.263
I love having kids.

39:44.264 --> 39:46.015
Best part about being a dad,

39:46.016 --> 39:48.184
I only have to see them
every other weekend.

39:48.185 --> 39:50.937
My wife's new husband...
he's great.

39:50.938 --> 39:52.271
He even taught me how
to throw a football.

39:52.272 --> 39:54.857
You guys are a hot crowd,

39:54.858 --> 39:55.858
not like my ex-wife...

39:55.859 --> 39:59.612
cold, drunk, and out
at two in the morning.

39:59.613 --> 40:01.155
Hey.

40:01.156 --> 40:02.573
Hey, what are you doing here? It's late.

40:02.574 --> 40:05.118
Can't a guy support his girlfriend?

40:05.119 --> 40:08.121
Um, that's sweet, but...

40:08.122 --> 40:10.331
please go home.

40:10.332 --> 40:12.458
Do we have a problem?

40:12.459 --> 40:14.627
Problem? Why would we have a problem?

40:14.628 --> 40:16.462
My father and my sister show up,

40:16.463 --> 40:18.256
and you couldn't get out
of there fast enough.

40:18.257 --> 40:20.216
No, I just... I was going up tonight,

40:20.217 --> 40:21.176
and I just needed time to prepare.

40:21.177 --> 40:24.220
You needed five hours?

40:24.221 --> 40:25.638
You'd flip if I pulled this shit on you

40:25.639 --> 40:28.307
right before you were gonna go on.

40:28.308 --> 40:30.309
Have you seen this crowd?

40:30.310 --> 40:31.978
This crowd is no different
than any other crowd.

40:31.979 --> 40:34.439
- They're not even listening.
- So make them listen.

40:36.191 --> 40:38.693
You know, you're being kind
of an asshole right now.

40:38.694 --> 40:40.486
You haven't played 2 a.
m. in a long time,

40:40.487 --> 40:42.488
and sometimes it's just a sucky crowd.

40:42.489 --> 40:44.157
Then give me five of your minutes,

40:44.158 --> 40:45.199
and I'll turn 'em around.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.785
Is this a test?

40:47.786 --> 40:48.828
A test?

40:48.829 --> 40:49.912
Yeah. Are you testing me?

40:49.913 --> 40:53.041
Yeah, I am. I'm being a
dedicated boyfriend, okay?

40:53.042 --> 40:53.959
And... and unlike you as a girlfriend,

40:53.960 --> 40:56.169
I think I'm passing with flying colors.

40:56.170 --> 40:58.337
Well, I guess that depends
on what your definition is.

40:58.338 --> 41:00.131
And what's your definition, Cass...

41:00.132 --> 41:01.174
carrying a torch for a dead guy?

41:01.175 --> 41:04.010
All right. Up next...

41:05.220 --> 41:06.596
Who we got? Um...

41:06.597 --> 41:09.182
They asleep back there? Who's next?

41:09.183 --> 41:11.476
Cassie?

41:11.477 --> 41:12.977
I can't believe you would do this to me

41:12.978 --> 41:14.187
right before I fucking go on.

41:14.188 --> 41:14.855
If you can't handle it,

41:14.856 --> 41:16.814
I'll warm 'em up for you.

41:16.815 --> 41:17.691
No, I don't need you to do that.

41:17.692 --> 41:19.942
Bill, I don't need you to do that.

41:19.943 --> 41:23.196
Oh, all right, we got
a last-minute substitution.

41:23.197 --> 41:25.031
Uh, he's a regular on The Main Stage,

41:25.032 --> 41:26.991
you're gonna see him on
<i>Midnight Special</i> very soon.

41:26.992 --> 41:28.367
My man, Mr. Bill Hobbs!

41:33.165 --> 41:35.291
All right. Good morning.

41:35.292 --> 41:37.627
Wow, what are the odds of an
entire front row of people

41:37.628 --> 41:40.671
who all had their dogs put
down on the same day, huh?

41:42.382 --> 41:44.050
Uh, I'm not married. Don't
like the idea of marriage.

41:44.051 --> 41:46.719
The whole anniversary gifts
is a real turnoff to me.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.179
You know, first year, paper.
Second year, cotton.

41:48.180 --> 41:49.555
Third year, leather.

41:49.556 --> 41:50.890
Sounds like a suicide kit, doesn't it?

41:50.891 --> 41:55.937
You know, it's...

41:55.938 --> 41:57.063
The paper to write the
suicide note with, you know?

41:57.064 --> 41:59.732
Like, "Oh, thanks for the
cotton last year, babe,

41:59.733 --> 42:01.692
and now the, uh, belt
to hang myself with."

42:03.445 --> 42:04.321
I feel like we should
amend that list, you know.

42:04.322 --> 42:05.905
It needs to be updated.

42:05.906 --> 42:08.157
It's one of those things
where it's, uh...

42:08.158 --> 42:09.492
That company
is gonna fall apart.

42:09.493 --> 42:10.369
a new... uh-uh, hey. Excuse me?

42:10.370 --> 42:12.245
Hi. Yeah, you, talking.

42:12.246 --> 42:13.579
I'm... I'm talking to you.

42:13.580 --> 42:15.498
Uh, who else would I be talking to?

42:15.499 --> 42:17.792
Um, I'm up here working,

42:17.793 --> 42:19.085
so if you don't mind
shutting the fuck up...

42:19.086 --> 42:20.461
Whoa!

42:20.462 --> 42:21.671
I'd be, uh, forever grateful.

42:21.672 --> 42:24.090
- Thank you.
- Just ignore me, okay?

42:24.091 --> 42:27.468
Uh, ignoring you is probably
easy for everyone in your life,

42:27.469 --> 42:30.263
but, uh, this is my job.

42:30.264 --> 42:32.014
So I'm up here, doing my job,

42:32.015 --> 42:33.516
my job is to stand here, talking,

42:33.517 --> 42:35.935
and yours is to sit
with your mouth shut,

42:35.936 --> 42:37.145
listening, okay?

42:37.146 --> 42:39.021
Be nice. We got laid off today.

42:39.022 --> 42:40.773
You got laid today?

42:40.774 --> 42:42.358
Judging by the expression on
your face, it wasn't that good.

42:42.359 --> 42:44.944
Our whole department got laid off today.

42:44.945 --> 42:46.529
Oh, really?

42:46.530 --> 42:48.114
Then why the fuck did you
come to a comedy show?

42:48.115 --> 42:49.949
Huh?

42:49.950 --> 42:51.784
Oh, Jesus, lady, you think
just 'cause your life is shit,

42:51.785 --> 42:53.452
you need to come here
and share the wealth?

42:53.453 --> 42:54.912
You know how fucking hard this is?

42:54.913 --> 42:56.455
No, you have no idea

42:56.456 --> 42:58.291
what it's like to put
yourself out there.

42:58.292 --> 43:00.501
I'm... I'm sure it's a lot harder
than whatever widget factory

43:00.502 --> 43:02.253
you and the traveling mausoleum
got shit-canned from today.

43:02.254 --> 43:03.421
Oh, great. Okay.

43:03.422 --> 43:05.214
- Okay.
- Thanks.

43:05.215 --> 43:06.382
Oh, oh, you taking off?
Now you gonna leave, huh?

43:06.383 --> 43:09.302
Fuck off. Go.

43:09.303 --> 43:11.470
Unemployment office isn't open
for another couple hours, girls.

43:11.471 --> 43:13.222
You're an asshole.

43:13.223 --> 43:15.099
Yeah, I am an asshole. Don't
ever fucking come back.

43:18.187 --> 43:19.146
Fuck it.

43:21.315 --> 43:23.900
Everybody, Bill Hobbs!

43:23.901 --> 43:28.322
Keynote speaker at
the next feminist convention.

43:41.501 --> 43:43.169
Hello?

43:43.170 --> 43:45.296
<i>Had a colleague
at your club last night,</i>

43:45.297 --> 43:47.465
said your Hobbs guy put on quite a show.

43:47.466 --> 43:50.218
Ugly, with a capital U.

43:50.219 --> 43:53.679
Well, I have no fucking idea
what you're talking about.

43:53.680 --> 43:54.514
We're dropping your boy.

43:54.515 --> 43:56.891
<i>Dropping him?</i>

43:56.892 --> 43:57.559
Well, that's fucking insane.

43:57.560 --> 44:00.603
He wasn't even scheduled.

44:00.604 --> 44:02.396
<i>We just want to wait a bit.</i>

44:02.397 --> 44:04.065
<i>We'll revisit the situation
in a couple of months.</i>

44:04.066 --> 44:07.276
Art, I give you my word, Bill's a pro.

44:08.654 --> 44:11.405
<i>Comics go off on people all the time.</i>

44:11.406 --> 44:13.532
<i>Maybe he had too much to drink, huh?</i>

44:13.533 --> 44:16.202
According to my guy,
he didn't just go off.

44:16.203 --> 44:17.453
He went ballistic.

44:17.454 --> 44:19.538
Look, we already got Robert Klein.

44:19.539 --> 44:22.375
Let's talk in a couple of months.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.714
<i>What, I-I'm an
idiot all of a sudden?</i>

44:28.715 --> 44:30.341
<i>I don't know my own kids?</i>

44:32.719 --> 44:33.844
Did I tell you I gave up coffee?

44:33.845 --> 44:37.473
The caffeine... made me anxious,

44:37.474 --> 44:39.100
made me say things in a way that was,

44:39.101 --> 44:42.728
let's just say, not as I'd intentioned.

44:42.729 --> 44:45.356
<i>Ended up burning a lot of bridges.</i>

44:45.357 --> 44:46.316
Not me.

44:46.317 --> 44:48.985
I love my coffee.

44:48.986 --> 44:50.403
But you go ahead...

44:50.404 --> 44:52.571
you enjoy your fucking tea.

45:08.797 --> 45:10.506
Hello?

45:10.507 --> 45:12.050
Hey, Goldie, what's up?

45:38.118 --> 45:38.910
I picked up your suit

45:38.911 --> 45:43.081
because that's what girlfriends do.

45:45.959 --> 45:47.460
Someone was there from <i>Midnight Special</i>

45:47.461 --> 45:50.629
when I...

45:50.630 --> 45:54.050
And, uh, I'm not...

45:54.051 --> 45:57.470
They cancelled.

45:57.471 --> 45:59.097
Is that Carrie?

46:02.476 --> 46:04.895
Well, is she coming in or not?

46:06.605 --> 46:08.647
Um, I'm... Thank you, Mr. Hobbs, but...

46:08.648 --> 46:10.901
She can't stay, Dad.

46:16.448 --> 46:19.450
Did this just happen?

46:19.451 --> 46:21.745
Yeah, Goldie just hung up.

46:25.832 --> 46:30.378
I'll call you later tonight, okay?

46:30.379 --> 46:31.713
Okay.

46:40.389 --> 46:43.182
You're okay, right?

46:43.183 --> 46:43.683
Yeah.

46:43.684 --> 46:46.353
Thanks for...

46:57.489 --> 46:59.074
Now what'd you do?

47:13.672 --> 47:15.381
The paint's looking good.

47:15.382 --> 47:18.426
Oh. Thanks.

47:18.427 --> 47:20.178
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

47:22.389 --> 47:24.432
Can I ask you a question?

47:24.433 --> 47:27.893
Sure.

47:27.894 --> 47:29.146
How are you at putting up shelves?

47:33.066 --> 47:34.650
Fine.

47:34.651 --> 47:35.610
'Cause I'm thinking
about putting some up

47:35.611 --> 47:39.738
where the bureau was...

47:39.739 --> 47:41.574
making this into an office.

47:41.575 --> 47:42.575
I don't have one up here.

47:42.576 --> 47:44.577
I do all my work at the
dining-room table.

47:44.578 --> 47:45.911
I got four bedrooms.

47:45.912 --> 47:48.330
It's crazy, huh?

47:48.331 --> 47:49.832
Yeah.

47:49.833 --> 47:52.668
Yeah.

47:52.669 --> 47:53.836
So your... your daughter's gonna sleep

47:53.837 --> 47:57.590
in one of the other rooms?

47:57.591 --> 48:00.509
My daughter.

48:00.510 --> 48:03.888
My daughter took off six months ago.

48:03.889 --> 48:07.600
Van pulled up, some
droopy-eyed stoner got out.

48:07.601 --> 48:10.686
She shoved everything that
mattered into a pink suitcase

48:10.687 --> 48:12.104
I bought for her when we went on a trip

48:12.105 --> 48:16.108
to the Grand Canyon when she was six.

48:16.109 --> 48:18.402
And that, as they say, was that.

48:21.740 --> 48:24.366
- Did she call or...?
- No.

48:26.786 --> 48:28.287
I was on my own when I was 17,

48:28.288 --> 48:31.207
so same difference, I suppose.

48:31.208 --> 48:34.585
I mean, clearly, she can
come home if she wants.

48:34.586 --> 48:37.005
Clearly, she doesn't want.

48:38.715 --> 48:41.175
Yeah, you love 'em, you feed 'em,

48:41.176 --> 48:45.513
try to protect 'em...
mostly from themselves.

48:45.514 --> 48:48.599
At least that's what you tell yourself.

48:48.600 --> 48:51.269
Ah, well, world keeps spinning, right?

48:52.687 --> 48:55.732
You miss her?

48:57.692 --> 49:00.028
Uh... uh, I'm sorry.

49:08.828 --> 49:11.580
She wore these slippers.

49:11.581 --> 49:16.001
They made this sound when she walked...

49:16.002 --> 49:20.506
like someone sanding wood.

49:20.507 --> 49:21.674
I miss that...

49:21.675 --> 49:25.678
that sound.

49:25.679 --> 49:29.139
I didn't need to talk. I
didn't need to see her.

49:29.140 --> 49:32.685
That sound, that... that was enough.

49:32.686 --> 49:36.231
The shelves are in the garage.

49:46.908 --> 49:49.702
It's not your fault.

49:49.703 --> 49:53.414
You know that, right?

49:53.415 --> 49:57.084
It's just, it's... it's
some kind of Hobbs curse.

50:06.720 --> 50:09.638
Your grandfather was, um...

50:09.639 --> 50:13.225
a cobbler, right?

50:13.226 --> 50:13.935
And he made

50:13.936 --> 50:16.645
the most beautiful men's shoes.

50:17.731 --> 50:22.651
He saved up the money and
opened up his own shop.

50:22.652 --> 50:25.529
And then the Depression hits.

50:26.906 --> 50:30.492
Oh, people don't need fancy shoes.

50:30.493 --> 50:32.620
They need a piece of bread,

50:32.621 --> 50:36.373
a bowl of soup.

50:36.374 --> 50:38.917
It's not his fault.

50:38.918 --> 50:42.963
He died working for some bum

50:42.964 --> 50:45.216
who treated him like dirt.

50:48.136 --> 50:52.181
He worked until he was almost 70.

50:52.182 --> 50:55.601
This guy yelling at him like...

50:55.602 --> 50:59.314
like he was some teenager
working there after school.

51:00.899 --> 51:02.775
The man fought in the
Battle of Belleau Wood,

51:02.776 --> 51:07.780
for Christ's sake.

51:07.781 --> 51:09.698
And me...

51:09.699 --> 51:12.201
It's Jap cars cutting into Detroit...

51:12.202 --> 51:13.619
ten years from my retirement.

51:13.620 --> 51:17.623
Fuck.

51:17.624 --> 51:21.211
God's got it out for the
Hobbs, that's all I know.

51:23.838 --> 51:25.798
Your grandfather

51:25.799 --> 51:29.802
compared us Hobbs to cavemen
throwing rocks at the moon,

51:29.803 --> 51:34.640
trying to knock it out of the sky.

51:34.641 --> 51:39.687
So try to think of it
as some sort of a...

51:39.688 --> 51:43.023
rite of passage...

51:43.024 --> 51:46.777
'cause you never stood a chance, son.

51:46.778 --> 51:48.821
Just throwing rocks at the moon,

51:48.822 --> 51:52.575
like the rest of us.

51:58.832 --> 51:59.998
- Edgar.
- Hmm?

51:59.999 --> 52:02.501
This guy look familiar to you?

52:02.502 --> 52:05.754
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh,
it's your dad, right?

52:05.755 --> 52:08.048
He admitted that you told
him to shit in my car.

52:08.049 --> 52:10.342
Oh, my God, Edgar, what did you do?

52:10.343 --> 52:13.303
I just fed a hungry man
Dinty Moore Beef Stew,

52:13.304 --> 52:16.306
and what he did after
that was his business.

52:16.307 --> 52:18.308
- Huh, literally.
- Right.

52:23.523 --> 52:25.483
Oh, shit.

52:27.402 --> 52:29.528
You have five seconds to bust my balls,

52:29.529 --> 52:33.574
or I'm gonna kick the fuck out
of each and every one of you.

52:33.575 --> 52:36.285
I think this just became
a <i>Midnight After-school Special.</i>

52:36.286 --> 52:37.786
Uh, the only special Bill's
gonna be shooting on Thursday

52:37.787 --> 52:40.164
is a .38.

52:40.165 --> 52:41.790
I don't know what's rustier,

52:41.791 --> 52:44.710
that suit, your pubes, or your act.

52:44.711 --> 52:46.962
What do you got, old man?

52:46.963 --> 52:48.547
You said there'd be
olives for me if I...

52:48.548 --> 52:50.048
Come on, Dad, let's get you fed.

52:50.049 --> 52:53.886
That was the best one.

52:53.887 --> 52:56.221
Bill, I'm really sorry...

52:56.222 --> 52:58.682
that you can't return that suit.

52:58.683 --> 53:00.684
Oh.

53:00.685 --> 53:03.187
You own it?

53:03.188 --> 53:06.940
Got to love the comedian.

53:06.941 --> 53:08.901
But to be honest, I was kind
of hoping for the girlfriend.

53:22.248 --> 53:23.624
Well, the shelves are up,

53:23.625 --> 53:26.335
and, um, all the painting is finished.

53:26.336 --> 53:28.587
Thank you, Adam.

53:28.588 --> 53:31.716
Come back tomorrow. I'll
have more work for you.

53:39.641 --> 53:41.392
Goldie, why am I here?

54:01.371 --> 54:04.582
<i>speaking Yiddish</i>

54:08.795 --> 54:10.337
One morning,

54:10.338 --> 54:13.924
while she was making their breakfast,

54:13.925 --> 54:16.134
Yussel walked up to his wife, Hette,

54:16.135 --> 54:18.136
and pinched her on the <i>tuchus.</i>

54:18.137 --> 54:20.931
And he said, "You know,

54:20.932 --> 54:22.307
if you firm this up,

54:22.308 --> 54:24.476
we could get rid of your girdle."

54:24.477 --> 54:29.314
Now, Hette thought this was
a terrible thing to say.

54:29.315 --> 54:33.652
But she refrained from responding.

54:33.653 --> 54:35.028
Next morning,

54:35.029 --> 54:38.657
Yussel wakes Hette up by
squeezing her breast.

54:38.658 --> 54:41.368
He says, "You know, if we firm these up,

54:41.369 --> 54:43.954
you could get rid of your bra."

54:43.955 --> 54:48.917
Now, Hette thought this
was unacceptable...

54:48.918 --> 54:52.629
and had to respond this time.

54:52.630 --> 54:53.839
So...

54:53.840 --> 54:56.008
she rolled over

54:56.009 --> 54:57.175
and grabbed him by his dick,

54:57.176 --> 55:00.470
and with a strong grip,

55:00.471 --> 55:03.390
she said, "You know,
if you firm this up,

55:03.391 --> 55:06.977
we could get rid of the postman,
the butcher, and your brother."

55:18.282 --> 55:21.409
That is so fun...

55:38.885 --> 55:39.968
Oh, shit.

55:39.969 --> 55:41.553
Whew.

55:41.554 --> 55:44.641
I'm still not... not sure
why I'm here, though.

55:46.684 --> 55:50.270
I guess it's because you know
when to shut the fuck up.

55:50.271 --> 55:53.899
<i>speaking Yiddish</i>

56:00.156 --> 56:03.200
And now a guy who made
his national TV debut

56:03.201 --> 56:05.786
this week, almost.

56:05.787 --> 56:11.041
Let's get some pity applause for Mr.
Bill Hobbs.

56:26.891 --> 56:29.768
I'm not married. I'm, uh, not
into the idea of marriage

56:29.769 --> 56:32.270
I find the anniversary
gifts a real turnoff.

56:32.271 --> 56:33.271
You know, first year, paper.
Second year, cotton.

56:33.272 --> 56:34.648
Third year, leather.

56:34.649 --> 56:38.235
Sounds like a suicide kit.

56:38.236 --> 56:40.445
Paper to write the suicide
note with, you know.

56:40.446 --> 56:42.280
"Thanks for the cotton last year, honey,

56:42.281 --> 56:44.116
oh, and the belt this year
to hang myself with."

56:45.785 --> 56:47.077
I feel like we should update this list

56:47.078 --> 56:48.037
just a little bit, don't you?

56:48.038 --> 56:50.914
Yeah, first year, peace.
Second year, quiet.

56:52.291 --> 56:54.751
Third year, fix me up with your sister.

56:55.212 --> 56:57.504
The cans on her.

56:57.505 --> 57:00.132
I'm half Irish, half Italian.

57:00.133 --> 57:02.050
You know, this is what happens
when a little Italian woman

57:02.051 --> 57:02.969
wants to get back at her dad.

57:04.178 --> 57:06.430
She goes, and she sleeps with
the biggest Mick in town.

57:06.431 --> 57:10.142
And out pops a full-sized leprechaun.

57:12.186 --> 57:15.021
Whoo!

57:20.987 --> 57:23.781
Oh, fuck.

57:27.160 --> 57:29.996
Fuck.

57:31.998 --> 57:34.166
Four?

57:34.167 --> 57:36.169
Dinty Moore, four for a buck.

57:39.088 --> 57:42.758
Peace?

57:42.759 --> 57:44.010
Peace.

57:47.139 --> 57:50.182
Want a ride home?

57:50.183 --> 57:51.058
Yeah. Thanks, Sully.

58:04.238 --> 58:06.198
Don't know the second verse.

58:06.199 --> 58:07.532
- There's a second verse?
- Mm.
