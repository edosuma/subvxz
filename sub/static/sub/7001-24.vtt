01:14.630 --> 01:19.259
And thus you have a beautifully
decorated nameplate for your home.

01:19.349 --> 01:23.579
So when you come to my door,
whose house is it, Al?

01:23.670 --> 01:25.819
Rolyat Mit.

01:27.349 --> 01:29.859
All you got to do is read it,
and it says…

01:29.950 --> 01:32.140
Rolyat Mit.

01:33.190 --> 01:34.740
How did I screw that up?

01:34.829 --> 01:38.700
Anyway, that's just one of the uses
for a scrolling saber saw.

01:38.789 --> 01:43.420
Another way to make a scroll cut
is use your coping saw.

01:43.509 --> 01:49.609
Al, do you suppose they call these coping
saws cos they're good at handling stress?

01:50.309 --> 01:52.900
I don't think so, Rolyat.

01:55.109 --> 01:58.220
Thanks, Al. I mean, La.

01:58.309 --> 02:03.220
Anyway, all this week.
La and I will be doing our salute

02:03.309 --> 02:05.500
to saws.

02:05.589 --> 02:08.258
To most people,
saws just mean noise, wood chips.

02:08.348 --> 02:11.380
and maybe a missing finger or mo.

02:11.470 --> 02:16.940
Not to me. To me, a saw says the sound
of power, something a man can relate to.

02:17.029 --> 02:21.539
Yeah, this bad boy is raw power.
Ar-ar yourselves. Yeah.

02:21.630 --> 02:26.980
This is a 3.5-cubic-inch chain saw.
Automatic oil, manual chain style.

02:39.230 --> 02:42.500
Yeah, you won't have this thing around
too long before you hear the wife going:

02:42.589 --> 02:45.980
"Are you sure you're supposed
to have that running in the bedroom?"

02:46.069 --> 02:50.539
You want to cut down on the noise,
put some tape across her mouth.

02:50.630 --> 02:53.059
I'm kidding.
Al, the women know I'm kidding, right?

02:53.150 --> 02:56.539
That's Tim "He's Not Kidding" Taylor…

02:58.549 --> 03:02.539
Boy. I'm tired of that sign, Al.
Besides, the women know I'm kidding.

03:02.630 --> 03:05.859
If not, they're probably
too busy yapping to hear me anyway.

03:05.950 --> 03:09.019
That's Tim Taylor, care of <i>Tool Time</i>,

03:09.109 --> 03:12.299
- PO box 3273…
- Al, Al.

03:12.390 --> 03:15.930
Do the words "job search"
mean anything to you at all?

03:18.470 --> 03:21.500
What I'm trying to say here
is that tools in general

03:21.589 --> 03:24.619
don't just have to make banging,
crashing, sawing noises.

03:24.710 --> 03:27.380
Tools can also make music.

03:29.269 --> 03:33.460
And to prove my point, I've got
a special guest invited here to <i>Tool Time</i>.

03:33.549 --> 03:37.579
So I expect a big <i>Tool Time</i> welcome
for Miss Janeen Rae Heller.

03:44.230 --> 03:46.900
Hi. Janeen.
This is my assistant, Al.

03:46.990 --> 03:49.180
- I'm a big fan of yours, Al.
- Thanks for that.

03:49.269 --> 03:51.460
Why don't you sit right down here?

03:51.549 --> 03:55.779
As we all can plainly see. Janeen's got
an ordinary Binford crosscut saw.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.299
Which means we're gonna
have her build us a sun porch.

03:58.390 --> 04:01.140
No, Tim, I'm going to be playing music.

04:01.230 --> 04:04.220
Music to even the most sensitive of ears.
All right, hit it. Janeen.

04:04.309 --> 04:06.339
- Any requests?
- Maybe…

04:06.430 --> 04:10.539
Yes. I have one.
It's from my favorite movie.

04:11.069 --> 04:13.940
Do you know the theme to <i>Dumbo</i> ?

04:17.548 --> 04:22.380
Tim, that's my favorite movie
about an elephant.

04:24.710 --> 04:27.380
I would like to hear "Greensleeves".

04:27.470 --> 04:29.700
Oh. Let's party.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.819
I know that.

05:16.509 --> 05:19.220
- Would you turn that down, please?
- What?

05:19.309 --> 05:22.660
- Turn it down. It's hurting my ears.
- Hurting your ears? I barely have it on.

05:22.750 --> 05:26.339
- Turn it down, turn it down, turn it down.
- You'll break the…

05:27.589 --> 05:30.500
See? Isn't that much better?

05:30.589 --> 05:32.970
Is the stereo on, hon?

05:33.069 --> 05:36.690
When you listen to it that loud,
it just sounds terrible.

05:36.789 --> 05:41.779
Music is to be experienced.
That's why you got to crank it up.

05:47.190 --> 05:50.140
- Isn't that better?
- No.

05:56.549 --> 05:59.579
- Oh. I don't believe this.
- What's wrong?

05:59.670 --> 06:02.049
I think I blew out the woofer
on these things.

06:02.150 --> 06:05.140
Well, can you fix that?

06:05.230 --> 06:07.529
You know, these are old.

06:07.630 --> 06:10.420
Why don't we buy new speakers?

06:10.509 --> 06:12.059
- No. No, no, no.
- Come on.

06:12.150 --> 06:14.299
Think about it. They're great.

06:14.390 --> 06:16.950
I been reading a lot about speakers now.
They're changing.

06:17.029 --> 06:20.940
five-way bass reflex, right?
Triple-crossover networks.

06:21.029 --> 06:26.180
It excites me so much when you talk about
conductors, high response.

06:26.269 --> 06:28.539
- megahertz, tweeters…
- Jill, they got…

06:28.630 --> 06:31.089
- You got a minute? You got a minute?
- ..woofers.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.339
- Can I speak for just one second?
- All right.

06:34.430 --> 06:37.819
They're new. Everything's got magnetic
dampening and cooling, mini tweeters.

06:37.910 --> 06:41.859
They got
aluminum diaphragms now in 'em.

06:41.950 --> 06:44.940
You just rest. I'm going down
to Lucky G Stereo to check it out.

06:45.029 --> 06:49.259
You're not gonna buy anything
but speakers, right? Nothing else.

06:49.349 --> 06:52.740
No, no. Well, maybe look at amps.
Digital audio's out. Kind of cool.

06:52.829 --> 06:56.900
- You stay here. I'll go buy the speakers.
- Jill, please, please stay here.

06:56.990 --> 07:00.339
You go, you'll end up getting
matching wood grain and a soft dėcor

07:00.430 --> 07:03.339
to go with carpets,
chairs and linoleum.

07:03.430 --> 07:06.220
Men's speakers - that's what I'm after.
Speakers with attitude.

07:06.309 --> 07:09.930
Speakers that haven't shaved
in a couple of days, that's it.

07:10.029 --> 07:13.809
Before you get all these hairy speakers.
I want you to stop and think to yourself:

07:13.910 --> 07:17.259
"What would Jill want me to buy?"

07:17.349 --> 07:19.579
- I always do that.
- Listen this time.

07:19.670 --> 07:21.220
All right.

07:21.309 --> 07:25.339
I'll buy sensible speakers, but we could
upgrade the amp, boost the power…

07:25.430 --> 07:28.779
No boosting. No rewiring.
I just want something simple I can turn on.

07:28.869 --> 07:30.859
Like me.

07:33.109 --> 07:35.819
Not that simple.

07:37.589 --> 07:40.779
- Dad, are these good speakers?
- You bet. The best.

07:40.869 --> 07:46.220
Dual concentric design speaker elements
with the tweeter inside the woofer.

07:46.309 --> 07:48.299
Woof!

07:48.869 --> 07:51.619
OK, you get the donuts.
I'll distract Dad.

07:51.710 --> 07:52.819
OK.

07:52.910 --> 07:54.539
Hey. Dad.

07:54.630 --> 07:55.539
Yes, son?

07:58.269 --> 08:00.900
- How's it going?
- OK.

08:00.990 --> 08:03.059
I got a question for you.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.059
How do you build a house?

08:06.150 --> 08:10.299
That's a good question, first you select
the site where you're gonna build.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.059
Then you pick the style of house.

08:12.150 --> 08:16.140
And then you put the donuts
right back in the cupboard.

08:16.990 --> 08:18.819
Oh, man!

08:20.390 --> 08:24.740
Where you going? I haven't finished.
Then you pour the foundation…

08:24.829 --> 08:25.940
Later. Dad.

08:26.029 --> 08:31.700
Dad. I found the instructions.
You said there weren't any.

08:33.109 --> 08:36.299
Real men don't use instructions, son.

08:37.869 --> 08:43.740
Besides, this is just the manufacturer's
opinion of how to put this together.

08:43.828 --> 08:47.740
- We got a better way, don't we?
- Yeah.

08:47.829 --> 08:50.940
While I got you, help me
take these boxes out to the garbage.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.819
Hi-de-ho, big neighbor
and little neighbor.

08:56.910 --> 08:58.019
Hi, Wilson.

08:58.109 --> 09:02.380
- I see you got some stereo equipment.
- Ah, state of the art, my friend.

09:02.470 --> 09:05.579
I was looking for speakers, but I ended up
with a whole entertainment center.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.140
So you and Jill went shopping together.

09:07.230 --> 09:10.299
She couldn't make it,
so I'm hoping to surprise her.

09:13.549 --> 09:19.779
Wait till she sees the CD player.
Eight times oversampling. Holds 18 CDs.

09:19.869 --> 09:22.660
We could party all night, man.

09:25.549 --> 09:26.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:26.789 --> 09:32.779
Your lovely wife just came in, Tim, and I
think you're right. She does look surprised.

09:34.349 --> 09:36.980
Well, Jill?
What do you think?

09:37.069 --> 09:40.460
- How much did it cost?
- Well…

09:40.549 --> 09:45.140
- Not a lot, considering all the titanium…
- How much?

09:46.349 --> 09:47.940
Well… Nothing.

09:48.029 --> 09:52.890
Actually, it's on a five-day trial. If you
don't like it, you get your money back.

09:52.990 --> 09:57.059
I thought you were gonna ask yourself.
"What would Jill want me to buy?"

09:57.150 --> 09:59.940
I asked her.
This is what she said.

10:01.509 --> 10:07.019
No, the… the salesman
down at the stereo place - Biff - said:

10:07.109 --> 10:09.539
"Are you into opera?"

10:09.630 --> 10:12.740
- Biff asked you that?
- Yeah.

10:12.829 --> 10:18.059
And he said that if you are, you'd like
the Dolby Pro Logic Surround Sound.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.380
- I see.
- Yeah.

10:20.470 --> 10:25.659
- So you bought all this stuff for me.
- Absolutely.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.820
- What is this thing right there?
- Your new police scanner.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.659
Gee, thanks, honey.
It's just what I always wanted.

10:34.750 --> 10:38.739
I was gonna wait for our anniversary,
but, you know, it's a special time for me.

10:38.829 --> 10:43.059
Why are you obsessed with all this
gadgetry? This is way too complicated.

10:43.150 --> 10:44.619
- This couldn't be simpler.
- Oh, yeah?

10:44.710 --> 10:46.940
Then you tell me,
how do I turn the TV on?

10:47.030 --> 10:52.300
Piece of cake. Set your pre-amp,
turn on your amp, set VTR button to "TV".

10:52.389 --> 10:57.739
sound system acoustical or flat.
Dolby up one C, flip on your monitor.

10:58.989 --> 11:02.019
Tim, box it up, open the door,
put it in the car, take it back.

11:02.110 --> 11:05.500
Look. I anticipated your techno-fright.

11:07.230 --> 11:11.059
Watch what I did. I rewired
the whole system to be sound-sensitive.

11:11.150 --> 11:15.420
What's that? Listen to this.
You just turn the whole unit on. OK.

11:15.510 --> 11:19.380
Now… You want the TV on?
Clap once.

11:21.070 --> 11:23.059
Come on.

11:25.030 --> 11:27.019
See?

11:27.429 --> 11:28.650
Oh, no, uh…

11:28.750 --> 11:30.900
TV's twice.

11:34.429 --> 11:36.730
Three times. TV. There…

11:37.869 --> 11:40.019
I'll get this. Hold on.

11:40.110 --> 11:41.699
OK…

11:44.590 --> 11:47.150
Just turn it all off.

11:48.949 --> 11:50.380
Tim.

11:50.469 --> 11:54.250
Turn off! Go away! Stop it!
Hello! Ho! Ho! Ho!

11:54.349 --> 11:58.260
Look. I have a very technical solution.

12:01.349 --> 12:02.940
- Yeah! That was it.
- It worked.

12:04.269 --> 12:05.820
- Tim.
- Yeah?

12:05.909 --> 12:10.619
I have a question about this remote
you installed, where you clap.

12:10.710 --> 12:16.219
When we're watching the opera and the
audience applauds, will it turn the TV off?

12:20.269 --> 12:24.340
Help me out and grab that bare wire
for me, please.

12:24.429 --> 12:29.860
- Tim. I don't want to be a nagging wife.
- Then how will I recognize you?

12:29.949 --> 12:32.579
All right.
You're loving and supporting. Let go.

12:32.670 --> 12:36.369
What are you?
A mud wrestler on the weekends?

12:36.469 --> 12:39.139
Mark, your ride is here.
Get a move on.

12:52.789 --> 12:58.340
"To series your equipment.
Locate audio-in jack and auxiliary output."

12:58.429 --> 13:01.539
"for VCR and CD,
reverse process or go…"

13:01.630 --> 13:05.739
Oh, jeez. Do I go in from the output
or out from the input?

13:05.829 --> 13:07.980
- Hi-de-ho, neighbor.
- Hi, Wilson.

13:08.070 --> 13:10.219
Did you get that sound system
hooked up yet?

13:10.309 --> 13:12.769
Oh, yeah. Piece of cake, man.

13:13.869 --> 13:17.860
- Can I ask you a question?
- Woof my tweeter, Tim.

13:20.230 --> 13:23.420
When you listen to your music, do you
have it up so loud it rattles the walls?

13:23.510 --> 13:26.739
Well. I used to, Tim, but nowadays
when I pound on the bongos that hard.

13:26.829 --> 13:28.860
it just makes my palms sore.

13:29.789 --> 13:31.010
Right.

13:31.110 --> 13:34.780
Jill thinks I'm obsessed
with all this stereo technology.

13:34.869 --> 13:39.699
That's not it, you know. I like the loud
music, but I like sound. That's what I like.

13:39.789 --> 13:43.179
I like 20 megahertz roaring through
my body, shaking my bladder.

13:43.269 --> 13:46.699
My brain's blasting,
my stomach's quivering…

13:47.789 --> 13:50.059
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

13:50.670 --> 13:54.860
See, it's not unlike what the ancient
Greeks felt during a dithyramb.

13:54.949 --> 13:57.860
Dithyramb?
How do you spell that?

13:57.949 --> 14:01.619
Well… Let's just say a poem
with wild and irregular rhythms.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.179
- Let's just say that.
- Right.

14:03.269 --> 14:05.860
The dithyramb actually was
a prelude to Greek theater.

14:05.949 --> 14:08.900
There was much stylized
dancing and chanting

14:08.989 --> 14:12.260
as 50 naked men danced
to the beat of a drum.

14:12.349 --> 14:16.340
I think there's a place like that
down by the airport.

14:17.949 --> 14:21.860
One of my favorite dithyrambs is similar
to the chorus in a play by Aeschylus.

14:21.949 --> 14:25.139
Give ear to my dithyramb. Ho!

14:27.429 --> 14:30.820
My flesh crawls
while I listen to them pray.

14:30.909 --> 14:34.219
The day of doom has waited long.

14:34.309 --> 14:39.780
Oh, pain, grown into the race
and blood-dripping stroke

14:39.869 --> 14:44.139
and grinding cry of disaster moaning

14:44.230 --> 14:47.619
and impossible weight to bear.

14:52.550 --> 14:54.739
I am cleansed.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.860
These guys would do that naked?

15:06.269 --> 15:09.260
Thank you all. Thank you all.

15:10.190 --> 15:12.460
Ar-ar yourselves. Cut it out.

15:12.550 --> 15:15.860
Welcome to the show. We have
a very special program. I'm Tim Taylor.

15:15.949 --> 15:21.070
Of course, this is my assistant
Al "I Wish I Could Be Tim Taylor" Borland.

15:22.349 --> 15:24.860
Like I said,
we have a very special show today.

15:24.949 --> 15:29.380
You mean you're not going to
break anything, Tim?

15:29.469 --> 15:32.460
Maybe just your contract, fella.

15:34.269 --> 15:37.380
Last time, if you remember,
we saw Janeen Rae Heller play her saw.

15:37.469 --> 15:38.610
That's right.

15:38.710 --> 15:44.099
- Remember seeing Janeen play the saw?
- Yes, Tim, I've seen her saw.

15:44.190 --> 15:47.179
So, you say you saw her saw?

15:50.190 --> 15:53.579
Yes. I saw her saw.

15:53.670 --> 15:55.460
So?

15:57.349 --> 16:00.579
So now you're saying you saw her sew.

16:00.670 --> 16:03.659
Not sew.
I've seen her saw.

16:03.750 --> 16:06.460
I see.
Enough of that nonsense.

16:06.550 --> 16:10.900
After the show, we got a terrific letter from
the guys at K8B Construction Company.

16:10.989 --> 16:12.380
Boy, were they pumped.

16:12.469 --> 16:14.340
They wrote me,
and I was excited to see them.

16:14.429 --> 16:16.809
so I've invited them
down here to <i>Tool Time</i>.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.619
I want you all to give
a big <i>Tool Time</i> welcome

16:19.710 --> 16:22.300
to the boys from
K8B Construction. Bay City. Michigan -

16:22.389 --> 16:25.300
Rock, Dwayne, Pete and Juke!

16:34.349 --> 16:38.219
- It's really nice to have you back again.
- Great to be back, Timmy.

16:38.309 --> 16:41.980
Listen, we were so inspired
by Janeen's performance on that saw.

16:42.070 --> 16:47.500
next day we went out to the job site and
started listening to the sounds of the tools.

16:47.590 --> 16:51.900
We kept hearing
the reverberation of steel on steel.

16:51.989 --> 16:54.219
sledgehammers cracking concrete…

16:54.309 --> 16:56.500
and jackhammers busting cement!

16:56.590 --> 16:57.570
Yes!

16:57.670 --> 17:00.699
It was a veritable cacophony.

17:00.789 --> 17:04.569
culminating in a creative crescendo.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.699
Timmy, it was amazing.

17:12.789 --> 17:16.659
Old Juke here whipped out his mouth harp,
started playing along with those sounds.

17:16.750 --> 17:20.059
Musical magic was happening right there,
way above the traffic.

17:20.150 --> 17:22.659
You guys making music like that -
it reminds me of a dithyramb.

17:22.750 --> 17:27.659
You know, that Greek thing where
50 guys get naked and dance in a field?

17:35.349 --> 17:37.650
You know… you know what I mean.

17:38.909 --> 17:43.980
Well, we don't have time for that, Tim.
See we only get an hour off for lunch.

17:46.269 --> 17:49.059
- Rock, what do you have for us?
- Well…

17:49.150 --> 17:51.940
Timmy, the guys and I
have formed a band.

17:52.030 --> 17:55.570
I'll be playing the angle grinder
and a 55-gallon drum.

17:56.349 --> 18:00.260
Tim, I'm gonna be on
the galvanized-piping chimes

18:00.349 --> 18:02.380
and also on the anvil.

18:02.469 --> 18:07.219
Tim, I'll be on the trash can,
the gas cans and the wrench.

18:07.309 --> 18:10.260
In fact, Tim, I am
the entire rhythm section.

18:10.349 --> 18:14.820
And, Timmy, the lovely Janeen
is back to fill in the melody.

18:19.750 --> 18:23.449
Janeen, thank you for returning
to the show. Why don't you sit right here.

18:23.550 --> 18:26.900
Oh. God, my body's quivering right now
just thinking about this.

18:26.989 --> 18:31.929
People like this build together
to build a band that plays with only tools.

18:32.030 --> 18:35.539
I guess, Al, we could
call this "heavy metal".

18:36.510 --> 18:40.699
I don't think so, Tim,
but I do find them riveting.

18:42.309 --> 18:43.980
Good one, Al.

18:44.070 --> 18:47.340
Hey, Timmy, you're gonna love this.
We wrote this one just for you.

18:47.429 --> 18:50.300
We call it "The Ratchet Rhapsody".

18:51.150 --> 18:52.940
We-he-he-he-hell…

18:53.030 --> 18:58.659
Making their television debut right here on
<i>Tool Time</i>. K&B and the boys and Janeen.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.579
Rock, let's roll!

19:00.670 --> 19:01.650
Beat!

19:02.190 --> 19:04.650
That would be me.

19:04.869 --> 19:06.619
One. Two.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.619
One, mo, three…

19:29.389 --> 19:31.219
Two, three, four…

19:56.469 --> 19:58.980
Come on. Pete! Take it. Pete!

20:32.989 --> 20:34.420
Al!

20:52.630 --> 20:55.010
Thank you! Thank you!

20:55.110 --> 20:57.099
Thank you!

21:04.909 --> 21:08.940
- OK, Tim. Are you ready?
- Yeah, we want to listen to the speakers.

21:09.400 --> 21:15.789
Prepare to be amazed. I've got 500 watts
running through this bad boy.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.670
500 watts?

21:17.759 --> 21:20.430
Is it safe for us to be sitting here?

21:20.519 --> 21:23.589
- It's as safe as any other job I've done.
- OK, boys. Let's go.

21:23.680 --> 21:27.990
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come back here!
I mean it. Sit down here.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.859
All right. Ms Negativity.

21:31.960 --> 21:35.660
prepare yourself for a lovely Sunday
afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera

21:35.759 --> 21:39.430
in beautiful surround sound.

21:39.519 --> 21:43.299
I'll adjust the acoustic level
to "concert hall".

21:44.079 --> 21:48.910
That's wonderful, Tim,
but… turn it down.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.430
I'm trying, dammit.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.509
It's stuck.

22:16.599 --> 22:20.190
- I talked to the insurance agent.
- I hope they're gonna pay for this.

22:20.279 --> 22:23.029
Yeah, they are,
but they're doubling our deductible.

22:23.119 --> 22:24.630
Why?

22:24.720 --> 22:28.420
They seem to think
that you're accident-prone.

22:30.119 --> 22:34.950
- Where are they getting that idea?
- Well, Tim, just stop and think about it.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.589
Al. I was gonna get to that.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.829
Lawn ho!

23:05.480 --> 23:08.309
I see. I get that point.

23:14.680 --> 23:18.710
Why don't I just open my shirt
and let him crawl right in, huh?

23:31.440 --> 23:33.390
Lawn ho!

23:34.305 --> 23:40.358
