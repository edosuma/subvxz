WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.165
- Oh yeah!

00:03.200 --> 00:05.168
- Previously, on Being Human...

00:05.200 --> 00:07.498
- How long have you
been in this room, Ramona?

00:07.540 --> 00:08.769
- I'm always here.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.359
- Ramona's not a ghost.

00:10.410 --> 00:11.559
Why are you doing this?

00:11.610 --> 00:14.033
I've been trying to help you!

00:14.080 --> 00:16.242
She's the evil of
this house, personified.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.339
And she's not
letting us out alive.

00:18.380 --> 00:21.645
- Look at that. I'll have help.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.387
- Aidan, it's me.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.639
- Look, what happened
to Astrid, I'm heartbroken.

00:25.690 --> 00:27.351
- I know Josh killed her.

00:27.390 --> 00:29.222
Now, it's my turn.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.455
- It's happening.

00:30.490 --> 00:31.753
(Grunting)

00:31.790 --> 00:34.100
- Sally's gone,
and Josh destroyed her.

00:36.430 --> 00:37.659
- Oh!

00:41.540 --> 00:44.510
- (Sally): The day they
moved in was the best day.

00:44.540 --> 00:48.101
It felt like the start of
something new, something good.

00:51.280 --> 00:54.215
After everything that had
gone so wrong with my life,

00:54.250 --> 00:57.379
they walked through that door
and they brought possibility.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.286
- Ah!

00:59.320 --> 01:00.685
- Look at you, Julia Child.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.279
- If you're alone
in the kitchen

01:02.330 --> 01:03.525
and you make a mistake...

01:03.560 --> 01:05.153
(High-pitched):
...who will know?

01:05.190 --> 01:06.396
(Laughing)

01:08.330 --> 01:10.367
- Someone's
in the house!

01:10.400 --> 01:13.290
- When you look back at your
life with a person,

01:13.340 --> 01:14.694
sometimes you wonder:

01:14.740 --> 01:17.562
"Would we be friends
if we met now...

01:17.610 --> 01:19.169
(Laughing)

01:19.210 --> 01:21.269
"Or did the path that
we went on together

01:21.310 --> 01:23.278
"lead us to this place?

01:23.310 --> 01:25.847
"Did every triumph
or mistake along the way

01:25.880 --> 01:27.177
"make us fall in love?"

01:27.220 --> 01:28.369
- I kissed him too soon!

01:28.420 --> 01:30.240
- I think that everything

01:30.290 --> 01:31.712
happens for a reason:

01:31.750 --> 01:33.582
love, life...

01:33.620 --> 01:35.179
- Josh, Josh!

01:35.220 --> 01:36.528
- ...even death.

01:38.430 --> 01:42.867
I hold on to this place for a
reason, and that reason is now.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.322
Aidan!

01:44.370 --> 01:48.159
- I lied for you,
and now my son is dead.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.167
And Sally?

01:49.210 --> 01:51.167
- Aidan,
I'm right here!

01:51.210 --> 01:53.269
- It was the one thing...

01:53.310 --> 01:54.436
- Aidan, no!

01:54.480 --> 01:56.141
- ...that gave
me any hope!

01:56.180 --> 01:57.341
- (Josh):
OK, listen.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.848
- No, this is on you.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.279
- (Josh):
Listen, I...

02:01.320 --> 02:03.186
- Aidan, no! Don't do this!

02:03.220 --> 02:04.688
Aidan, back up right now!

02:04.720 --> 02:06.757
- I can explain this!
- This is on you!

02:06.790 --> 02:08.451
- Stop!

02:11.190 --> 02:12.749
This isn't happening!

02:12.800 --> 02:15.599
Oh God, this isn't happening!

02:15.630 --> 02:17.621
This is just some
crazy accident.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.468
- It's never an accident.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.770
- SHUT THE HELL UP!

02:23.810 --> 02:25.767
- What? How did you do...

02:25.810 --> 02:27.300
- What the hell
just happened?

02:27.340 --> 02:28.432
- I bought us some time.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.209
- (Aidan): Josh!

02:31.280 --> 02:33.248
Open this door!

02:33.280 --> 02:34.475
Open this door!

02:34.520 --> 02:36.215
- Oh my G--
- Open this door!

02:36.250 --> 02:39.356
- There's gotta be some way
we can snap him out of this!

02:39.390 --> 02:41.609
It's Aidan!
- He's in some kind of trance!

02:41.660 --> 02:43.389
- I think it's
what Kenny did.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.386
- What?

02:44.430 --> 02:45.522
- Oh my God!

02:45.560 --> 02:47.927
- Open this door!

02:47.960 --> 02:50.190
- He's gonna break down
the goddamn door!

02:50.230 --> 02:51.891
- Oh my God!
- No, I sealed it for now.

02:51.930 --> 02:54.934
I sealed it, but, Josh, he's not
gonna stop until he kills you.

02:54.970 --> 02:56.802
- What?
- What?

02:56.840 --> 02:58.262
- I said
open this door!

02:58.310 --> 03:00.404
- This has happened
before, all of it.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.545
I've seen it.
- You saw this?

03:02.580 --> 03:04.799
- I saw him come after you.
- You saw Josh die?

03:04.850 --> 03:06.909
(Glass shattering in distance)

03:06.950 --> 03:08.543
(Nora): We have
do something!

03:08.580 --> 03:11.686
- Yeah, we gotta find a way
for him to be himself again.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.609
- And how the
hell do we do that?

03:13.660 --> 03:15.810
- Sally, you
can't do magic.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.680
If that's what
you're thinking, stop!

03:17.730 --> 03:18.822
We'll figure it out!

03:18.860 --> 03:20.658
- Nora's right!
It's too dangerous!

03:20.700 --> 03:22.225
- So what am I supposed to do?

03:22.270 --> 03:23.669
- I don't know!
- Just leave you?

03:23.700 --> 03:26.795
That's not happening!
I can't do that to you!

03:26.840 --> 03:29.309
- (Aidan): Open the door!
Open this door!

03:29.340 --> 03:30.569
- So what, then?

03:30.610 --> 03:32.772
(Aidan screaming)

03:32.810 --> 03:35.905
- What if he wasn't a vampire?
- (Nora): What?

03:35.940 --> 03:38.546
- Right! What if we were in
Paris right now, Sally?

03:38.580 --> 03:41.345
- I feel like it's all been
leading up to this moment.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.809
It's all been leading
up to stopping this.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.614
(Aidan screaming)

03:48.490 --> 03:51.323
Guys, I love you.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.521
- Sally...

03:52.560 --> 03:54.221
- I'm making the decision.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.862
- Sally, what are you doing?

03:56.900 --> 03:58.925
Sally, don't...
- Sally!

03:58.970 --> 04:00.563
(Door opening)

04:13.350 --> 04:14.943
- Josh...

04:14.980 --> 04:17.449
Hey, pal, I just wanna talk.
- Aidan!

04:19.050 --> 04:20.983
- Oh my God!

04:21.019 --> 04:23.022
That was your plan?

04:23.060 --> 04:24.721
What did--
Did you kill him?

04:24.760 --> 04:26.694
- Can guys get him
on the bed? Come on!

04:26.730 --> 04:27.891
- Oh my...

04:29.400 --> 04:30.390
(Grunting)

04:39.070 --> 04:43.041
(Speaking Latin)

04:45.550 --> 04:47.644
Sally, what
are you doing?

04:47.680 --> 04:49.944
(Speaking Latin)

04:55.520 --> 04:57.284
Sally, what
did you do?

04:58.790 --> 05:00.895
- There's always a sacrifice.

05:04.530 --> 05:05.668
(Speaking Latin)

05:05.700 --> 05:06.770
(Gasping)

05:08.500 --> 05:11.629
(Gasping)

05:11.670 --> 05:13.536
- I can feel my heartbeat.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.638
- Sally...

05:17.110 --> 05:20.375
- Oh my God, Sally...

05:20.420 --> 05:21.376
(Moaning)

05:21.420 --> 05:22.581
Oh!

05:26.660 --> 05:30.426
- Nora, I want you to know
that I'm gonna be watching.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.760
All the beautiful moments,
I'm gonna be watching.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.950
You're gonna be so good at it!

05:36.000 --> 05:37.798
(Sighing)

05:38.800 --> 05:39.961
Josh...

05:41.140 --> 05:42.699
listen.

05:42.740 --> 05:44.731
It's worth it.

05:46.070 --> 05:47.674
(Chuckling)

05:47.710 --> 05:49.872
(Breathing heavily)

05:51.480 --> 05:53.972
I want you to have
the life you deserve.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.681
I love you.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.450
- Ah!

06:07.760 --> 06:08.795
- No!

06:08.830 --> 06:10.525
- (Aidan): Sally...

06:10.570 --> 06:12.129
(Exhaling)

06:12.170 --> 06:14.696
(Ramona screaming)

06:16.910 --> 06:18.105
- Ramona.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.107
(Josh screaming)

06:31.120 --> 06:33.009
- She was mine.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.751
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

06:36.790 --> 06:38.554
None of this
should have happened!

06:38.590 --> 06:39.591
She was my favourite!

06:40.730 --> 06:42.721
- Ah!
- She brought me back!

06:42.770 --> 06:45.899
And we were gonna be here
forever, and you ruined it!

06:45.930 --> 06:47.466
You ruined it all!

06:47.500 --> 06:48.729
(Screaming)

07:04.690 --> 07:07.057
- She...
What just happened?

07:07.090 --> 07:09.980
Does that mean she's gone?
- I don't know.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.124
But we need to get
out of here right away.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.127
Are you OK?

07:13.160 --> 07:14.457
- Come on.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.025
- OK, come on,
come on, come on.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.095
Let's go, let's go.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.497
(Siren wailing in distance)

07:29.980 --> 07:32.813
- (Nora): Somewhere
along the way, we grew up,

07:32.850 --> 07:35.046
and the idea of
what was home changed.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.912
It wasn't what our
parents built for us.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.588
It was what we
made for ourselves,

07:44.660 --> 07:49.496
those small moments of who buys
the milk and who gets the mail,

07:49.530 --> 07:53.239
who makes you smile
on a terrible day.

07:53.270 --> 07:57.104
Where we were, that
was home, that was family...

07:59.110 --> 08:02.671
a place where we could shut the
door and keep the world at bay.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.917
(Sighing)

08:06.950 --> 08:09.988
I know, now,
what a ghost truly is:

08:10.020 --> 08:11.988
a thick silence in a room

08:12.020 --> 08:15.615
that fills up the space
of someone you love.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.821
We can all stay here.

08:22.630 --> 08:25.065
- No, no, I wanna
give you guys some space.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.864
- We don't need s-space.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.062
- Aidan, after
everything that's happened...

08:29.100 --> 08:31.865
- Yeah, you do.
It's OK. It is.

08:33.909 --> 08:35.537
I'm gonna go to the trailer,

08:35.580 --> 08:37.605
like we planned,
like--like I planned.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.505
- All the times we...

08:40.780 --> 08:42.214
found her,

08:42.250 --> 08:44.719
all the times she
clawed her way back

08:44.750 --> 08:46.081
from whatever was happening--

08:46.120 --> 08:48.214
- No, not this time.

08:48.260 --> 08:50.786
I felt her go.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.028
- Although, it would
be just like Sally

08:56.060 --> 08:57.824
to do something epic right now

08:57.870 --> 08:59.759
and rip her way
out of your chest.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.165
- Oh God, that
would be awesome!

09:01.200 --> 09:02.599
- I'd love that so much.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.529
(Both laughing)

09:09.340 --> 09:11.172
- I don't know
what to do.

09:16.350 --> 09:19.650
- I know I'm invoking
my grandmother here

09:19.690 --> 09:20.851
when I say this,

09:20.890 --> 09:23.621
but when was
the last time you ate...

09:25.190 --> 09:26.260
food?

09:26.290 --> 09:28.190
(Nora chuckling)

09:28.230 --> 09:30.927
(* Country playing on stereo )

09:32.800 --> 09:34.131
- Oh my God!

09:34.170 --> 09:35.137
- Right?

09:35.170 --> 09:36.137
- Are you sure?

09:36.170 --> 09:37.205
- Yeah.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.629
- It really, suddenly,
tastes good?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.603
'Cause it's not like
you haven't eaten.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.677
I've seen you nibble
your way through meals.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.644
- Yes, and it all
tastes like dirt!

09:45.680 --> 09:49.014
Look, I spent 200 years
drinking nothing but blood,

09:49.050 --> 09:50.211
so, I don't know,

09:50.250 --> 09:52.787
half-cooked beef, seems
like a good segue to me.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.811
Mmm!
- We should get you chili fries.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.885
- Oh my God,
he just became human.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.887
He's already
trying to kill you!

09:58.930 --> 10:00.193
- No, I'm not!

10:00.230 --> 10:01.197
- No! Listen to me!

10:01.230 --> 10:02.823
I want those. I want them badly.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.964
I want them in my mouth now.
Make it happen!

10:05.000 --> 10:06.092
Can you make it happen?

10:06.130 --> 10:07.837
- OK, T'll order.
- Thank you!

10:07.870 --> 10:10.237
- But I'm not holding your
hair back when you vomit.

10:10.270 --> 10:11.362
(Laughing)

10:11.410 --> 10:14.107
(Sighing)

10:14.140 --> 10:16.973
- It's just
so strange.

10:17.010 --> 10:19.240
Even if my eyes are
just a little bit weaker,

10:19.280 --> 10:21.214
and even if I'm moving
a little slower,

10:21.250 --> 10:24.117
even if there aren't enough
cheeseburgers on this planet

10:24.150 --> 10:25.640
to fill the hunger,

10:25.690 --> 10:27.681
I mean, just, to just be...

10:29.260 --> 10:31.354
it's spectacular.

10:31.390 --> 10:32.619
(Sighing)

10:35.760 --> 10:37.296
And Sally had to miss it...

10:41.270 --> 10:43.238
and so, it's wasted on me.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.135
(Clears throat)

10:49.440 --> 10:53.115
- I'm gonna have Nora get you
the Sriracha chili fries.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.784
(Sighing)

11:00.860 --> 11:03.750
(* Comfortable with Silence
by Andy Shauf *)

11:03.790 --> 11:07.249
- (Slurred): Come here, buddy!
Come here!

11:07.300 --> 11:08.756
You're a good guy.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.167
(Howling)

11:11.200 --> 11:16.161
** The memories of family
send others by your side *

11:16.200 --> 11:18.237
(Sighing)

11:18.270 --> 11:22.002
* When the words are gone

11:22.040 --> 11:25.203
* Will quiet be a friend...

11:26.450 --> 11:27.872
Sally...

11:31.090 --> 11:33.787
I thought that you'd be here.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.754
OK...

11:36.960 --> 11:39.725
* Will you be comfortable

11:39.760 --> 11:43.298
* With silence in the end?

11:43.330 --> 11:45.162
* Will you sing... *

11:46.970 --> 11:50.031
(Grunting)

11:51.210 --> 11:53.030
(Screaming)

11:54.240 --> 11:57.175
(Sobbing)

12:01.950 --> 12:03.315
(Panting)

12:05.850 --> 12:07.215
(Grunting)

12:08.460 --> 12:10.326
(Birds chirping)

12:11.330 --> 12:13.059
(Grunting)

12:56.840 --> 12:58.865
- Oh! What are you
doing in here, miss?

13:00.510 --> 13:03.377
Uh, do you have some parents
or something I should call?

13:03.410 --> 13:06.277
"Cause, um...
- They left a long time ago.

13:06.310 --> 13:08.870
- You shouldn't be in here.
This is really dangerous.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.412
There's broken glass
everywhere, there's nails...

13:11.450 --> 13:13.009
- Wanna see my room?
- No!

13:13.060 --> 13:16.109
I--I don't wanna
see your room. What--

13:16.160 --> 13:18.254
Miss, I've got work to do!

13:21.130 --> 13:22.291
Miss!

13:22.330 --> 13:24.526
(Man sighing)

13:26.400 --> 13:28.266
Miss?

13:35.210 --> 13:36.871
Hello?

13:52.460 --> 13:54.428
This isn't in the plans!

13:54.460 --> 13:56.326
- (Ramona): It's my secret.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.462
- What is this?

13:58.500 --> 13:59.934
Ah!

13:59.970 --> 14:03.133
(Gasping, grunting)

14:03.170 --> 14:04.865
(Thudding)

14:04.910 --> 14:06.935
- They shouldn't have
left me alone.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.074
But that's OK.

14:09.110 --> 14:11.306
We can send them a message.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.057
I've seen it,

14:21.090 --> 14:23.582
_but never
quite experienced

14:23.630 --> 14:26.327
the anxiety of worrying
about a test result.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.924
- I just don't understand
how this is happening.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.940
- Really? I mean, after
everything we've been through,

14:33.970 --> 14:36.029
this--this is
what surprises you?

14:36.070 --> 14:37.208
Really?

14:43.150 --> 14:45.039
Oh...

14:46.550 --> 14:50.111
I'm not meant to be alive.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.187
- (Whispering):
But you are!

14:52.220 --> 14:56.179
I saw it happen,
what Sally did.

14:56.220 --> 14:58.655
She gave you life.
- Yes, she did.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.920
She made me
mortal, but, um,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.059
I think it's
about that time.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.932
Hmm?

15:06.970 --> 15:08.369
I mean, look at this.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.233
I've got the heart of
a 90-year-old man,

15:11.270 --> 15:14.376
which ain't bad,
all things considered.

15:14.410 --> 15:18.369
- It's everything, Aidan.
Your liver, kidneys...

15:18.410 --> 15:19.639
(Clearing throat)

15:19.680 --> 15:21.978
Your body's shutting down.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.648
- Yeah. You didn't need to
smile at Larry the lab guy.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.249
I could've told you that.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.279
How long you figure I've got?

15:33.700 --> 15:36.419
- I'm amazed you're
standing here right now.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.137
- See, I was thinking
about a week.

15:44.170 --> 15:46.161
Come on, Nora,
What do you say?

15:46.210 --> 15:48.304
Can I talk
you into a week?

15:48.340 --> 15:50.650
(Chuckling)

15:50.680 --> 15:52.170
(Horn blaring)

15:52.210 --> 15:54.417
- (Josh):
I think it might be good.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.009
I know it's
kind of a weird thing

15:56.050 --> 15:58.280
to circle back around
to restaurant work, but...

15:58.320 --> 16:00.288
- Well, it's not
bussing tables.

16:00.320 --> 16:03.119
You'd be cooking, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.582
I'd be on the line.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.724
It'd give me something
to focus on, you know?

16:06.760 --> 16:08.558
- That's great.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.420
- (Laughing): Oh yeah?

16:10.470 --> 16:13.132
You don't seem
super enthused!

16:13.170 --> 16:16.037
I mean, I know you didn't wanna
marry the onion guy, but--

16:16.070 --> 16:17.435
- It's not that.

16:17.470 --> 16:19.302
I think it's great
for you, honestly.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.434
- Yeah. And you love
cooking, so it's...

16:21.480 --> 16:23.107
- Exactly.
It'll ground you.

16:24.510 --> 16:26.604
- OK, so why do I feel
like we're living in

16:26.650 --> 16:28.709
an Eastern European
silent film right now?

16:28.750 --> 16:31.185
- Hey, hey, it's OK.
- It's not OK.

16:31.220 --> 16:33.314
Josh is making plans,
which is great,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.454
but we should all
be making plans!

16:35.490 --> 16:36.753
- Guys!

16:36.790 --> 16:38.349
What the hell's going on?

16:39.790 --> 16:41.622
Guys!

16:43.500 --> 16:45.468
- I got a week to live.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.469
- That's...

16:49.500 --> 16:51.730
That's not something
people say in real life.

16:51.770 --> 16:54.410
- Yeah, but I'm
saying it to you.

16:55.410 --> 16:57.572
- I don't understand.

16:57.610 --> 17:00.614
- Did we really think
that I would just come back

17:00.650 --> 17:02.641
and be human with
no consequences?

17:02.680 --> 17:04.489
What has ever
led us to believe

17:04.520 --> 17:05.782
that life is
that simple?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.480
- Is it something
in Sally's spell?

17:09.520 --> 17:11.659
- No, it's the years
that I cheated.

17:11.690 --> 17:13.624
They're all catching up with me.

17:13.660 --> 17:15.195
That's all.

17:15.230 --> 17:17.767
- (Nora): "That's all."
Like it's nothing!

17:17.800 --> 17:20.098
- No, it's-- That's not
what I mean, Nora.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.266
I mean...

17:21.300 --> 17:22.461
(Sighs)

17:22.500 --> 17:24.332
...if I've got a week,

17:24.369 --> 17:27.078
well, then let's
live that week, you know?

17:27.109 --> 17:28.236
Let's be together!

17:28.280 --> 17:30.339
Let's find something
to laugh about.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.109
Let's eat
a little less meat.

17:32.150 --> 17:33.640
Or let's celebrate your baby!

17:33.680 --> 17:35.216
That's what
I care about!

17:35.250 --> 17:37.548
- What?
- I never said anything to you.

17:37.590 --> 17:42.517
- OK-- I thought that you knew
and you just weren't telling me.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.483
I just... OK, look.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.658
What happened is,
I smelled it, you know,

17:46.690 --> 17:47.760
when I was still me,

17:47.800 --> 17:49.427
and I--I smelled
the extra blood.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.360
The heartbeat...
I could hear the...

17:51.400 --> 17:54.495
- Heartbeat?
- And it's a good heartbeat!

17:57.710 --> 18:00.577
Come on! This is
a good thing, isn't it?

18:02.440 --> 18:04.306
I'm just gonna
give you guys a minute!

18:11.750 --> 18:15.118
- This is why I didn't know
how to tell you.

18:19.230 --> 18:21.255
- How are you feeling?
Are you OK?

18:22.330 --> 18:24.469
- I am.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.561
I wasn't sure
this was what I wanted,

18:27.600 --> 18:30.137
after everything.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.706
- Yeah.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.731
- But I do.

18:35.210 --> 18:37.269
It's intense!

18:37.310 --> 18:40.177
It's like this primal
feeling just took over,

18:40.220 --> 18:41.745
and I know that
I could do this.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.139
Are you OK?

18:45.190 --> 18:47.181
I know that it's crazy.

18:47.220 --> 18:49.587
- Yeah...

18:49.620 --> 18:51.349
We should be
institutionalized!

18:51.390 --> 18:54.189
(Both laughing)

18:54.230 --> 18:57.461
We're having a baby?

Bartender!

20:29.990 --> 20:32.288
Can we get another
one over here?

20:32.330 --> 20:34.298
- I couldn't.
- Yeah, you can!

20:34.330 --> 20:36.458
- Last one, all right?
And then...

20:37.730 --> 20:39.494
I'm coming back.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.300
(Sighing)

20:54.380 --> 20:56.747
- So, what's
the plan, chief?

20:58.890 --> 21:00.585
What's the plan
for cleaning up?

21:00.620 --> 21:02.850
What are you gonna do
with the body, all that?

21:02.890 --> 21:03.857
- Excuse me?

21:03.890 --> 21:05.756
- Look, junior,
40 minutes from now,

21:05.790 --> 21:09.328
you're gonna find yourself
crumpled on her bedroom floor,

21:09.360 --> 21:11.328
every drop of
her blood in your belly,

21:11.370 --> 21:14.260
no idea how you got there,
no idea what to do next.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.735
- What are you?

21:20.740 --> 21:22.504
- I'm you,

21:23.880 --> 21:25.700
give or take 200 years.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.510
Are you
serious?

21:29.550 --> 21:30.517
- Yeah.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.609
- Oh my God,
humans are stupid!

21:32.650 --> 21:34.015
OK, listen,
listen, listen.

21:34.060 --> 21:37.519
You need someone to check in
with, and get on bagged blood.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.880
You hear me?
Bagged blood.

21:38.930 --> 21:41.854
It tastes like ass, and you're
not gonna want it as much,

21:41.900 --> 21:43.629
but it will dial
down your intake.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.762
- That worked for you?

21:44.800 --> 21:47.360
- Nothing worked for me.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.665
- So, seriously, how do I skip
all this and get to be you?

21:50.710 --> 21:52.530
(Chuckling)

21:52.570 --> 21:55.369
No, because I already know
I can't do this.

21:55.410 --> 21:56.536
I'm not a monster.

21:56.580 --> 21:59.880
How can I become
human again?

21:59.910 --> 22:02.880
- It is something that
I've wanted for decades,

22:02.920 --> 22:04.046
for centuries.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.910
That's all
I could think about.

22:05.950 --> 22:09.511
"How can I be
the man that I was?"

22:09.560 --> 22:10.925
- Yeah.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.450
- And now...

22:13.700 --> 22:15.759
(Sighing)

22:15.800 --> 22:19.430
All I can think
about is, uh,

22:19.470 --> 22:21.029
going back.

22:29.410 --> 22:30.969
(Groaning)

22:31.010 --> 22:31.977
Very, very good!

22:32.010 --> 22:32.977
- What the hell?

22:33.010 --> 22:34.944
- Yeah! Now,
listen to me, Son.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.039
You're going to turn me.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.959
- Why?

22:45.990 --> 22:49.028
- Ah, it's just, uh,
working in a restaurant is...

22:49.060 --> 22:50.562
We're having a baby.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.694
I can't pull
restaurant hours.

22:52.730 --> 22:55.836
- Well, we'll figure it out.
It's what you wanna do.

22:55.870 --> 22:58.168
- Yeah, I know, but
I can find another job.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.429
- But it's not
just about the job.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.938
This was something that
was gonna make you happy.

23:02.980 --> 23:05.449
- Yeah, but, I mean,

23:05.480 --> 23:08.575
well, we're having a baby!

23:08.620 --> 23:12.443
- And does that
make you happy?

23:12.490 --> 23:13.457
- What?

23:13.490 --> 23:14.958
Of course, it does.

23:14.990 --> 23:19.450
I'm elated. I just wanna
think about this practically.

23:19.490 --> 23:20.992
I mean, I can't
take a job

23:21.030 --> 23:24.000
that takes me away from the
house for 18 hours a day.

23:24.030 --> 23:27.864
Besides, you know,
I was thinking, um...

23:27.900 --> 23:31.609
I was thinking about maybe
trying some kind of medication.

23:31.640 --> 23:32.960
Whatever the closest--

23:33.010 --> 23:35.729
- Josh, you and Sally
already talked about this.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.613
You can do
this yourself,

23:40.650 --> 23:42.539
You can
already do this.

23:42.580 --> 23:43.741
- Nora...

23:43.790 --> 23:45.019
- You don't
need medication.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.040
- Nora...

23:49.520 --> 23:52.126
I killed 9 people
last week.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.858
- You did it
to protect me.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.720
- Aren't you scared?

24:00.130 --> 24:01.734
Doesn't that scare you?

24:01.770 --> 24:04.034
I mean, you are gonna be
this amazing force,

24:04.070 --> 24:05.560
this incredible mom!

24:05.610 --> 24:08.477
Aren't you scared?

24:08.510 --> 24:10.171
I mean, what if
I freak out?

24:10.210 --> 24:12.042
What if I--
What if I panic?

24:12.080 --> 24:13.718
What if I
hurt the baby?

24:13.750 --> 24:14.717
- No, Josh.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.570
- You can't
just say no.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.918
- None of that
scares me,

24:18.950 --> 24:21.055
"cause I know
who you are.

24:21.090 --> 24:22.057
(Sighing)

24:22.090 --> 24:23.524
And I trust you.

24:25.090 --> 24:28.628
But I need to know
that you can trust yourself,

24:32.900 --> 24:35.767
- Aidan wanted me to
meet him at this bar.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.508
- You do what
you need to do.

24:44.210 --> 24:46.702
(Siren wailing)

25:07.970 --> 25:10.029
- Hey!

25:10.070 --> 25:12.710
Hey, hey!
Get off him!

25:12.740 --> 25:14.299
- Hey, hey! Whoa!

25:14.340 --> 25:15.671
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:15.710 --> 25:17.235
Josh, let him go.
Let him go!

25:17.280 --> 25:18.247
(Grunting)

25:18.280 --> 25:20.840
Ow!

25:20.880 --> 25:22.712
- Well, I didn't
ask for this.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.582
- You weren't
even fighting!

25:24.620 --> 25:26.247
- It's OK, Jeremy.

25:26.290 --> 25:28.816
Go on, take off.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.124
- Want to explain?

25:33.160 --> 25:35.959
- Not particularly, no.
I don't think you'd understand.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.252
- Oh, don't
start with that.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.223
- Everything's gonna be fine.

25:39.270 --> 25:41.693
- It's not gonna be fine!
It's not gonna be fine!

25:41.740 --> 25:43.959
You have a week
left to live!

25:44.010 --> 25:46.661
You've got the insides
of a geriatric.

25:46.710 --> 25:48.872
You can't just go
spilling your blood

25:48.910 --> 25:51.971
like it's 1955 and
you're king of the world!

25:52.010 --> 25:53.671
You fought for this!

25:53.720 --> 25:56.849
You fought for this,
and Sally gave it to you,

25:56.880 --> 25:58.689
you selfish
son of a bitch!

25:58.720 --> 26:01.155
- I'm afraid
to die, Josh!

26:01.190 --> 26:03.158
I'm afraid to die.

26:03.190 --> 26:05.887
I have one week, Josh.
One week, if that.

26:05.930 --> 26:08.820
And do you wanna know what
happens after that, Josh?

26:08.860 --> 26:10.760
I_\lothing!
Nothing happens!

26:10.800 --> 26:14.737
Because vampires don't get
doors. No happy endings for us!

26:14.770 --> 26:18.308
I am afraid to die!

26:18.340 --> 26:20.160
(Panting)

26:20.210 --> 26:21.974
(Groaning)

26:22.010 --> 26:23.648
- You're not
a vampire anymore.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.045
- Are you kidding me?

26:25.080 --> 26:26.309
- You're not a vampire.

26:26.350 --> 26:29.047
- Are you kidding me?
Listen to what you're saying!

26:29.080 --> 26:31.913
You really think that
a blip of humanity

26:31.950 --> 26:35.056
is gonna wipe the slate clean
after centuries of monstrosity?

26:35.090 --> 26:36.910
No! No!

26:36.960 --> 26:38.780
(Sighing)

26:38.830 --> 26:43.222
So I saw my chance,
and I took it!

26:48.340 --> 26:51.059
It turns out that
I'm a coward.

26:51.110 --> 26:54.330
(Crying)

26:54.380 --> 26:56.701
- No, you're not.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.203
You're a human.

27:00.250 --> 27:01.843
(Laughing)

27:04.720 --> 27:06.347
(Sobbing)

27:06.390 --> 27:09.189
It's gonna be OK!
It's gonna be OK!

27:15.200 --> 27:17.225
(Exhaling sharply)

27:17.260 --> 27:18.523
(Grunting)

27:21.740 --> 27:23.390
- Yeah!

27:28.010 --> 27:29.978
- Hey, buddy!

27:30.010 --> 27:31.375
- Hello.

27:31.410 --> 27:33.720
- I got you your favourite,
triple everything.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.117
- Oh, no. I can't handle
one more triple everything.

27:36.150 --> 27:38.244
Actually, screw it.
Give me triple everything.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.384
- I know you.
Man, you want this.

27:40.420 --> 27:41.854
- Absolutely!

27:41.890 --> 27:43.927
(Grunting)

27:43.960 --> 27:47.123
Now, where is that
neighbourhood section?

27:47.160 --> 27:49.857
I'm looking for
something like:

27:49.900 --> 27:52.392
"Top 10 Historical
Gems in Boston".

27:52.430 --> 27:54.364
That would be
fun, right?

27:54.400 --> 27:55.868
- I don't know, would it?

27:55.900 --> 27:57.095
- Come on!

27:57.140 --> 27:58.733
- I would think most people,

27:58.770 --> 28:01.376
if they're told they
have a week left to live,

28:01.410 --> 28:04.141
they might wanna, you know,
travel the world, get laid.

28:04.180 --> 28:06.945
(Coughing)

28:06.980 --> 28:08.709
(Chuckling)

28:13.290 --> 28:16.089
- Oh no.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.088
- What?

28:18.130 --> 28:20.895
- There was a murder of
a construction worker.

28:20.930 --> 28:21.897
- OK.

28:21.930 --> 28:22.920
- In our house.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.164
- I don't know,

28:33.210 --> 28:36.976
- but it never felt
right running away.

28:37.010 --> 28:38.876
We gotta go back
to that house.

28:38.910 --> 28:40.309
- No, you're right.
- Yeah.

28:40.350 --> 28:42.114
- Let's do it.

28:42.150 --> 28:45.040
- Yeah, except why don't
you let me do it?

28:46.550 --> 28:48.780
- What the hell are
you talking about?

28:48.820 --> 28:49.855
Would you stop that?

28:49.890 --> 28:51.449
- I've been
thinking about it.

28:51.490 --> 28:54.255
I've got nothing to lose.
You've got everything to lose.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.927
- Yeah, and you're
part of that!

28:55.960 --> 28:57.860
- Yeah, but
you've got Nora.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.994
You've got a baby coming.
You've got a life.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.338
That's a lot, Josh.

29:01.370 --> 29:03.429
- I'm not gonna value
my life over yours.

29:03.470 --> 29:05.131
- And I'm not
asking you to,

29:05.170 --> 29:07.207
but someone's gonna
make it out of this.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.299
It wasn't Sally,

29:09.340 --> 29:12.071
and it ain't gonna be me.

29:12.110 --> 29:14.010
It's you and Nora.

29:14.050 --> 29:16.769
You have a chance.

29:16.820 --> 29:19.482
- You know you're not
gonna win this, right?

29:19.520 --> 29:21.909
I'm not gonna let you
do this alone, OK?

29:21.960 --> 29:23.416
I'm not gonna
let you do it!

29:23.460 --> 29:25.224
- All right,
all right, all right.

29:25.260 --> 29:27.456
(Inhaling deeply)

29:27.490 --> 29:30.824
But if we really wanna win this,
we gotta go in prepared.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.463
So when we get in town,

29:32.500 --> 29:34.935
just drop me off
at the nearest corner.

29:34.970 --> 29:36.438
I'm gonna find some stuff.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.837
Meet me at the
house in an hour.

29:38.870 --> 29:41.908
You better talk to Nora,
because she's gonna wanna--

29:41.940 --> 29:43.578
- Don't worry
about it. I got it.

29:43.610 --> 29:45.100
One hour.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.402
- Mm-hmm.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.851
(Car honking)

30:03.430 --> 30:05.319
(Sighing)

30:05.370 --> 30:08.089
Sorry, Josh.

30:13.170 --> 30:15.275
(Sighing)

30:25.650 --> 30:28.449
(Running footsteps)

30:30.660 --> 30:33.152
(Clearing throat, sighing)

30:33.190 --> 30:34.954
(Door closing)

30:35.000 --> 30:36.149
Ramona.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.362
(Door slamming)

30:48.310 --> 30:50.506
(Rumbling)

30:50.540 --> 30:52.645
(Ramona giggling, echoing)

30:52.680 --> 30:55.069
(Grunting, sighing)

31:11.700 --> 31:15.000
(Coughing)

31:17.570 --> 31:21.279
Well, there you are.

31:21.310 --> 31:24.075
- I see you got my message.

31:24.110 --> 31:25.669
- Yep!

31:25.710 --> 31:26.939
(Grunting)

31:26.980 --> 31:28.141
I did.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.545
But you gotta know

31:29.580 --> 31:32.618
there ain't nothing left
for you to win.

31:32.650 --> 31:34.152
I'm mortal.

31:34.190 --> 31:36.955
I'm just an old man
with a few days to live.

31:36.990 --> 31:39.550
And let me tell you
something, little girl.

31:39.590 --> 31:43.299
I ain't gonna be draining
anyone's blood anytime soon.

31:43.330 --> 31:47.096
- You did a pretty good job
while you had the chance.

31:47.130 --> 31:48.165
(Chuckling)

31:49.370 --> 31:51.600
- I want you to know

31:51.640 --> 31:55.372
that Josh and Nora and
their baby are gonna be moving

31:55.410 --> 31:56.935
far away from here.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.574
They're going
to live a life.

31:59.610 --> 32:03.171
And Sally,
Sally is gone.

32:03.220 --> 32:06.713
And you, well, this old house,
your hold over it,

32:06.750 --> 32:09.583
well, it certainly
can't last forever, can it?

32:09.620 --> 32:12.123
- Someone else will move in,

32:12.160 --> 32:16.529
and as you can see,
accidents happen.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.495
- Hmm, maybe.

32:20.700 --> 32:23.590
Or maybe the four of us,

32:23.640 --> 32:27.634
supernaturally
cursed as we were,

32:27.670 --> 32:30.503
moved under this roof

32:30.540 --> 32:33.669
for one sole reason:

32:35.520 --> 32:38.615
to bring you down.

32:38.650 --> 32:40.482
(Chuckling)

32:40.520 --> 32:43.615
- And you think
it's gonna be you?

32:43.660 --> 32:48.757
You like to think of
yourself as some kind of hero,

32:48.800 --> 32:51.622
but really, you're
the worst of them all.

32:51.670 --> 32:55.493
All this tragedy,
it's on you.

32:55.540 --> 32:58.237
Sally was the one
who brought me back.

32:58.270 --> 33:00.238
But you're the one
that fed me,

33:00.270 --> 33:02.671
with all the
blood you shed.

33:02.710 --> 33:04.508
You're the real
monster here.

33:04.550 --> 33:07.042
- I've lived with my regret.

33:07.080 --> 33:08.718
- And so that's enough?

33:08.750 --> 33:11.583
I'm not Catholic, Aidan.

33:11.620 --> 33:15.250
A few Hail Marys won't
get you out of this.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.429
(Groaning)

33:24.470 --> 33:26.359
(Chuckling)

33:26.400 --> 33:28.038
- That's a real neat trick.

33:28.070 --> 33:30.437
(Groaning)

33:30.470 --> 33:33.007
- And now,
you can choke on it.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.272
This won't take
long at all, old man.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.139
(Groaning)

33:50.690 --> 33:52.522
You really think
you'll be saved

33:52.560 --> 33:55.052
just because you'll
die a mortal death?

33:55.100 --> 33:57.523
- I assume nothing
at this point.

33:57.560 --> 33:59.289
- But you're hoping.

33:59.330 --> 34:00.593
Maybe you're
just a man now,

34:00.630 --> 34:02.735
but you were a serial
killer for centuries.

34:02.770 --> 34:05.569
You think there's a door
leading to some kind of heaven

34:05.610 --> 34:08.170
after the blood
you've shed.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.076
- I've lived my life.

34:10.110 --> 34:11.804
And this is my death.

34:11.850 --> 34:15.616
I've died for
my family before.

34:15.650 --> 34:17.812
I'm happy to
do it again.

34:17.850 --> 34:21.047
(Rumbling, grunting)

34:30.260 --> 34:34.766
** Close your eyes *

34:34.800 --> 34:38.202
* See what is missing *

34:39.409 --> 34:41.504
(Gasping)

34:41.540 --> 34:43.338
* Gone before its time *

34:46.610 --> 34:50.513
* No goodbyes *

34:50.550 --> 34:54.088
* No new beginnings *

34:55.790 --> 34:58.259
* I'll be left behind *

34:58.290 --> 35:06.290
(Ramona screaming)

35:14.710 --> 35:17.873
- (Aidan): When the end comes
* Trushing up at you, *

35:17.910 --> 35:22.211
and everything that you thought
was real starts to fall away,

35:22.250 --> 35:26.517
you consider the meaning
of the life that you lived,

35:26.550 --> 35:28.279
and you realize

35:28.320 --> 35:32.427
that the only thing that means
a damn thing at the end

35:32.460 --> 35:33.780
is what you loved.

35:33.830 --> 35:36.299
And you think of who you love,

35:36.330 --> 35:38.719
and you let it take you home.

35:56.350 --> 35:58.444
(Siren wailing)

36:00.290 --> 36:02.782
- (Woman on police radio):
We need a car over

36:02.820 --> 36:04.288
to make a pick up at...

36:12.230 --> 36:14.437
- (Officer): Sir, step back
a little bit.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.437
(Woman on police
radio, indistinct)

36:26.250 --> 36:27.740
- (Whispering):
Oh my God!

36:38.260 --> 36:39.921
Oh my God!

36:49.540 --> 36:51.360
There's nothing left.

37:04.790 --> 37:09.660
- I don't want you-- I don't
want you to ever question.

37:09.690 --> 37:11.784
I never want
you to worry.

37:14.060 --> 37:17.360
I'm always gonna
be there for you.

37:18.670 --> 37:19.899
For us.

37:22.540 --> 37:23.689
For the baby.

37:23.740 --> 37:27.734
- Let's just hope that
you two don't screw it up.

37:27.770 --> 37:28.737
- Oh, Aidan!

37:28.780 --> 37:31.408
- You know,
historically speaking...

37:31.450 --> 37:32.599
- Oh my God!

37:32.650 --> 37:34.345
- ...the children
of psychiatrists

37:34.380 --> 37:35.939
put a lot of issues
on their kids.

37:35.980 --> 37:37.414
(Josh and Nora chuckling)

37:37.450 --> 37:38.940
- How did
you do this?

37:38.990 --> 37:40.640
How was this
possible?

37:40.690 --> 37:42.613
- I don't know. Um...

37:42.660 --> 37:44.424
(Aidan exhaling sharply)

37:44.460 --> 37:45.484
It's such a weird...

37:45.530 --> 37:47.282
(Moaning like ghost)

37:47.330 --> 37:48.297
...thing.

37:48.330 --> 37:49.820
But you know what?
It's OK.

37:49.860 --> 37:53.296
It's worth it,
because we won.

37:53.330 --> 37:54.695
(Josh and Aidan laughing)

37:54.740 --> 37:57.698
- So, this is what that
looks like, huh? Winning?

37:57.740 --> 37:59.765
- Yeah! This is us winning.
- This is it?

37:59.810 --> 38:01.574
(Chuckling)

38:01.610 --> 38:04.409
- No, but it is,
because look at you two.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.306
I mean, this is what
we talked about, right?

38:07.350 --> 38:08.579
- So, then, what now?

38:08.620 --> 38:11.817
Are you gonna come haunt us
at our house or what?

38:11.850 --> 38:14.387
- Uh, no, because
that's weird.

38:14.420 --> 38:15.558
- Oh, that's weird?

38:15.590 --> 38:16.716
- I'm not
doing it!

38:16.760 --> 38:19.320
- Now that you're dead,
it's weird now?

38:19.360 --> 38:20.953
- Yes, it is,
because, look,

38:20.990 --> 38:24.528
the place that you're living
in is kind of small, Josh,

38:24.570 --> 38:25.867
and I need space.

38:25.900 --> 38:28.665
I need to, like, spread out.
I need to move around.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.567
And come on, I can't go soft,
just because I'm dead.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.907
- I don't think you can
come with us anyway.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.608
(Gasps)

38:39.650 --> 38:40.799
(Exhaling slowly)

38:40.850 --> 38:42.875
- Well, hey, this
can't be for me.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.115
- It's for you, man!

38:44.150 --> 38:45.481
(Crying)

38:45.520 --> 38:47.739
And don't think
for a second

38:47.790 --> 38:49.519
that you don't deserve it.

38:57.730 --> 39:00.370
- OK, listen to me.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.494
Um, all of the years
that I've been alive,

39:02.540 --> 39:04.360
these last few,
they were the best.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.629
- There was some
rough stuff in there.

39:06.670 --> 39:08.479
- No, no, no.
They were the best.

39:13.150 --> 39:15.471
- We love you.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.841
(* I'm Not Falling Asleep
by Andy Shauf *)

39:17.880 --> 39:23.057
We will live a ridiculous life

39:23.090 --> 39:25.752
in your honour.

39:25.790 --> 39:29.590
** When will I ever be
safe from myself *

39:29.630 --> 39:30.722
(Exhaling slowly)

39:30.760 --> 39:32.023
(Sniffling)

39:32.070 --> 39:34.539
* If the danger all lies *

39:34.570 --> 39:38.063
* Between heaven and hell... *

39:38.100 --> 39:39.659
(Crying)

39:48.450 --> 39:50.418
(Breathing unevenly)

39:50.450 --> 39:53.090
- Aidan!

39:53.120 --> 39:56.090
Finally!

39:56.120 --> 39:59.556
- (Whispering):
She's there!

39:59.590 --> 40:01.024
(Exhaling sharply)

40:01.060 --> 40:02.698
- (Whispering):
How are you?

40:02.730 --> 40:06.689
- You're seriously gonna ask me
that question right now?

40:06.730 --> 40:08.437
(Chuckling)

40:08.470 --> 40:10.495
* When I close my eyes *

40:10.540 --> 40:12.759
* I'm not falling asleep *

40:12.810 --> 40:16.633
* I'm not falling asleep *

40:16.680 --> 40:18.978
* I'm not falling asleep **

40:22.120 --> 40:23.849
Is there really
nothing I can do?

40:23.880 --> 40:26.986
- You can sit there and let us
cook you dinner for once.

40:27.020 --> 40:29.182
- I can't do that!
- I know it's killing you.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.858
- Look, you're
making a mess!

40:30.890 --> 40:32.654
- I know what I'm doing.

40:32.690 --> 40:35.694
It's a mistake to let a Jewish
werewolf loose on a crustacean.

40:35.730 --> 40:36.959
- That's racist!

40:37.000 --> 40:39.867
(All talking)

40:39.900 --> 40:43.996
- (Josh): The day we moved in
was the first day of my life.

40:44.040 --> 40:48.580
Before then, before them,
I had no chance.

40:48.610 --> 40:53.480
I didn't think
I could feel human, feel love,

40:53.510 --> 40:55.114
The little things --

40:55.150 --> 40:59.542
coffee grounds, laundry day,
sleeping late, living life --

40:59.590 --> 41:05.051
thank you for every
small moment of this world.

41:05.090 --> 41:08.082
No, the lobster lives!
Not on my watch!

41:08.130 --> 41:10.053
- Oh, the lobster lives!

41:10.100 --> 41:13.195
(Birds chirping)

41:15.840 --> 41:17.569
- Hmm...

41:20.770 --> 41:24.570
I just had an amazing dream.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.044
- Yeah?

41:26.080 --> 41:28.879
- Yeah.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.843
- I dreamt of them.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.041
(Sighing)

41:32.090 --> 41:33.580
- Me too.

41:33.620 --> 41:35.054
(Chuckling)

41:35.090 --> 41:38.583
The four of us
all together.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.120
It was nice.

41:43.230 --> 41:45.870
- Do you think
it's actually them?

41:48.570 --> 41:52.200
Do you think we just dream
about them because we miss them?

41:52.240 --> 41:55.278
- No, I think
it's 100% them.

41:55.310 --> 42:00.749
They're sitting on a cloud
somewhere, dream-weaving.

42:00.780 --> 42:02.077
(Chuckling)

42:02.120 --> 42:03.269
- Dream-weaving.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.742
- Yeah.

42:04.790 --> 42:06.144
(Both chuckling)

42:07.620 --> 42:09.611
- What time is it, anyway?

42:09.660 --> 42:11.116
- I don't know.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.288
- We left the pies
in the oven.

42:13.330 --> 42:17.995
- Oh God! And our children
are running wild.

42:19.230 --> 42:21.790
(Both chuckling)

42:21.840 --> 42:26.209
- Sally! What are you
doing, honey? Huh?

42:26.240 --> 42:27.605
Huh?

42:27.640 --> 42:28.710
- Aidan!

42:28.740 --> 42:29.901
Oh, oh, oh!

42:29.940 --> 42:31.271
(Aidan laughing)

42:31.310 --> 42:34.348
Oh, you wanna play tag?
You spying on me, you crazy kid?

42:34.380 --> 42:35.848
- Look!
You want pie now?

42:35.880 --> 42:36.847
- You crazy kid!

42:36.880 --> 42:38.075
What are you doing, man?

42:38.120 --> 42:39.087
(Aidan laughing)

42:39.120 --> 42:40.849
Aidan!

42:40.890 --> 42:43.916
