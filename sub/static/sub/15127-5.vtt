00:01.300 --> 00:03.490
I want to see the pyramids.

00:03.500 --> 00:08.500
I want a suit made out of silk
from Hong Kong.

00:11.500 --> 00:15.490
I want my own blend of tobacco
and a pipe of ivory.

00:15.500 --> 00:19.490
I want a pair of shoes...
made out of silver.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.490
That's the stupidest idea
I think I've ever heard.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.500
You'll be jealous.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

00:40.500 --> 00:42.500
It's your turn.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.500
I want you.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.500
Nothing more.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.500
Tell me.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.500
Tell me we can do this.
We can do this.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.490
I promise you.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.489
We have Quint's folio.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.490
He'll pay.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.490
He has to.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.490
He'll pay whatever we want.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.490
Then I want my suit
and my silver bloody shoes.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.490
Shit. Luke's gonna skin us.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.490
Let him try.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.490
Come next week,
we'll be long gone from all of 'em.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.500
All of this.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.490
Harry Collins! Harry, liven up.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.490
Regent Street, Baker Street,
Haymarket.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.500
David Goodbody.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.500
David Goodbody.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.500
David?

02:23.500 --> 02:24.500
No Vincent neither.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.490
Otto Roberts.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.490
Do you want to earn a few quid?
Special?

02:31.500 --> 02:34.490
Harlequin. David's ground, but...

02:34.500 --> 02:36.490
Early bird and all that.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.490
Please come in.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.500
You may close the door now.
I'm the boy you called for.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.490
I, er...have something for you, sir.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.490
Yes, David.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.500
I believe you do.

03:26.500 --> 03:31.490
Buggery, sodomy,
and acts homosexual are crimes.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.490
There'll be no bail, sir. Go.

03:33.500 --> 03:37.500
If you'll follow me, sir.
Next!

03:39.500 --> 03:41.500
Oi! We'll have less of
that!

03:43.500 --> 03:46.490
Quite a haul, Inspector Ed.

03:46.500 --> 03:50.490
Another foul molly house brought to
ground by the brave crusaders of
Leman Street.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.490
On the side of the pansies now,
are you?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.490
On the side,
as ever, only of justice.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.490
Tell me, Sergeant, what room here
for the cut-throats and filchers of
Whitechapel,

03:58.500 --> 04:02.490
when your cells runneth over
with mandrakes and rantipoles?

04:02.500 --> 04:04.490
Oh, no doubt you'd have the streets
amok with arse-mongers.

04:04.500 --> 04:09.490
Streets, sir?
You raided a private residence.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.490
Are there any, um...

04:11.500 --> 04:14.490
are there any blue bloods this time?

04:14.500 --> 04:18.490
Or are they all still running scared
after Cleveland Street?

04:18.500 --> 04:21.490
Do not ever again come here
for your muckraking.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.490
Escort Mr Best back to the gutter.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.490
This is a free land, Inspector,
first in the civilised world.

04:26.500 --> 04:31.500
It is not muck I seek to shovel
into cold light here, but rank
hypocrisy!

04:33.500 --> 04:35.500
Goulston Street, sir, telegraph boy.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.490
- Otto Roberts?
- Yes, sir.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.490
Who was it occupied this room?

04:41.500 --> 04:44.490
Didn't give his name, sir.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.490
This ain't The Savoy.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.490
Could have fooled me.
His appearance?

04:48.500 --> 04:50.490
Middle-aged business type.

04:50.500 --> 04:54.500
Not too shabby, not too smart.
He looked like anyone.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.490
My guests don't care to be studied.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.490
Faces come and go.
Some pay by the hour. Did he?

05:00.500 --> 05:04.490
Coughed up for day and night.
Said he awaited a telegram.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.490
I should send up the boy.

05:06.500 --> 05:09.490
Get inside! Come on, Tommy!

05:09.500 --> 05:12.490
If you could perchance hasten
matters,

05:12.500 --> 05:15.490
I should like to rent the room again
before lunch.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.500
Get him before Jackson.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.500
All right, which of you goddamn
whoresons is a flimflam man, huh?

05:30.500 --> 05:32.490
Come on, I'm not fresh off the...

05:32.500 --> 05:34.500
Good to see you. I'll get a drink.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.500
All right, we're not done here.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.500
What say one of you fellas lends me
the money for another hand, huh?

05:51.500 --> 05:53.500
Dr Yankee.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.490
Nice duds.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.490
My ship came in. Gin for everyone.

06:01.500 --> 06:05.490
Must have been a goddamn galleon.
Call it a fleet.

06:05.500 --> 06:09.490
Well, I'd love to say
I don't begrudge you a penny,
Charlie, but I'm a shitty liar.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.500
How about you squaring
some of what's owed, huh?

06:24.500 --> 06:26.500
Plus interest, with thanks.

06:29.500 --> 06:33.490
And I can do better than that, Doc.
You've done me a turn once or twice.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.490
All this...

06:35.500 --> 06:36.500
it's there for the taking.

06:38.500 --> 06:42.490
You boy! You manage here?
Barely.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.490
Messenger was sent this morning
to Goulston Street.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.490
Is that so?
Harlequin Hotel.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.500
Oh, that was...

06:50.500 --> 06:52.490
He shouldn't have even been there.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.490
It wasn't his job.
Then whose?

06:54.500 --> 06:57.490
David. David Goodbody.
Around that way's his patch.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.490
My ears are burning.
I wish all of you was burning.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.500
What's afoot?
Otto's dead.

07:04.500 --> 07:05.490
- What?
- Took your rounds

07:05.500 --> 07:08.490
cos you'd done a bloody bunk,
and some bastard killed him.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.490
Who are you?
Am I under arrest?

07:10.500 --> 07:12.490
- Watch your tongue, boy.
- Vincent.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.500
Featherwell.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.490
I was with David today.
Went to the fair in Bethnal Green.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.490
During work?
Isn't illegal to hate your job.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.490
Who was the telegram for?
I only had the address.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.490
Is that usual?

07:26.500 --> 07:29.490
It happens. We just deliver.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.490
You, David, have you been
at the Harlequin before?

07:32.500 --> 07:33.500
No.

07:38.500 --> 07:42.500
Are you certain about that?
Yes. Yes, sir.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.490
Help me discover
what befell your friend.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.490
I need to know where that telegram
was sent from, when, and by whom.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.500
I do not wish to make
such a visit here again.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.490
According to their ledger,
the telegram was sent
from a bureau in the city.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.490
No name given.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.490
You can see here, all these,
day after day, week after week,

08:03.500 --> 08:06.490
sent from the heart of the City
to addresses in Whitechapel.

08:06.500 --> 08:09.490
But no replies.
The mail only travels one way.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.490
That's banker's turf.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.490
What business have well-to-do's
telegraphing the rookery?

08:12.500 --> 08:16.490
Why indeed? See here.
David Goodbody lies.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.490
He's been dispatched
to the Harlequin three times
this fortnight.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.490
Find these other addresses.
I want to know
who's been receiving these missives.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
Strangulation, then?

08:25.500 --> 08:28.490
Silk fibres.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.490
From a scarf maybe.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.490
A knot tied in it.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.490
And the boy was sexually active.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.490
Very active, and not with women.

08:37.500 --> 08:41.490
Was he forced? Not that I can see,
least not today.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.490
He was just, I don't know,
an enthusiast.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.490
They're bloody everywhere.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.490
Don't knock it till you tried it,
Benito.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.500
I know some stevedores'd
treat you like a princess.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.490
Those addresses, almost all of them,

08:52.500 --> 08:54.490
flag the Harlequin.
I want to know the movements

08:54.500 --> 08:55.490
of this boy, David. Trail him.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.500
And his friend, sir? The gobby one?
Him too.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.500
Tierra del Fuego.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.500
South America.

09:10.500 --> 09:14.500
It's the land of fire.
My friend Charlie gave it to me.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.490
Might as well be
goddamn hieroglyphics to me.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.490
I mean, look at this.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.490
You know anything about investments,

09:22.500 --> 09:24.500
stocks, bridge loans?

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
Land of fire? Sounds like hell.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.490
I'm looking for my friend...

09:55.500 --> 09:57.500
David Goodbody.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.500
He's off shift.

10:00.500 --> 10:04.490
Who, then, might know
where I could find him?

10:07.500 --> 10:09.490
I'll give it back.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.490
- Tell Quint it was a mistake.
- No.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.490
We see this through.
How?

10:13.500 --> 10:17.490
Quint's gonna kill us. I mean,
that should have been me today.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.490
I know that.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.490
My love, believe me, I know that.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.490
You're here and we're alive,

10:22.500 --> 10:27.500
and, while blood still pumps in me,
I'll not give up on the plans we've
made.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.490
Whoever Quint sent for us
went to your patch

10:30.500 --> 10:33.490
and assumed the boy
who showed up was you.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.490
He didn't know Otto was Otto.
He doesn't know my face.

10:36.500 --> 10:40.490
Nor mine. There's still time
to see this through.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.490
So, we hit back and we hit hard.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.500
What we asked for, let's double it.

10:49.500 --> 10:53.490
I'm going to see Freddie Best.
We need to ensure we're safe.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.500
Come with.
I've a job.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.490
No.
Take my knife.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.500
And what about you?
Please. For this job, at least.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.490
I told you.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
We can do this.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.490
You heard about Otto?
Course I bloody did.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.500
Poor sod. I thought
you'd given up the frig jobs.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.490
Money's money.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.500
Is, um...

11:46.500 --> 11:48.500
..is Harry all right?
Harry's fine.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.490
He sent this. Said he'd meet you
at the Harlequin after his shift.

11:53.500 --> 11:57.490
So, Otto, what do you know?

11:57.500 --> 12:01.490
How would you like The Star to turn
the biggest bank in London upside
down?

12:01.500 --> 12:04.490
Just what the hell was Otto up to?
Otto wasn't.

12:04.500 --> 12:05.500
He wasn't supposed to be there.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.500
There's a copper watching us.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
Freddie, go now.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.490
- You're a policeman, are you not?
- Keep your voice down.

12:45.500 --> 12:49.490
I am an abominable bugger, sir,
a proud Uranian.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.490
A hunter of hinder parts.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.490
A keen participant in behaviours
grotesque and indecent.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.490
Homo sapiens homosexual.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.500
Take me in.

13:33.500 --> 13:38.500
You are aware of the consequences of
the admission you made to my
constable?

13:41.500 --> 13:44.490
I fear, sir, there may have been
a misunderstanding.

13:44.500 --> 13:48.500
My intemperate consumption.
You see, I'm...

13:49.500 --> 13:53.490
The wretched gin
had quite scrambled my faculties.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.490
I recall not a word I uttered
to your good man,

13:56.500 --> 13:59.490
and I must insist I retract,
in toto.

13:59.500 --> 14:03.490
David Goodbody sells himself
under the guise of his delivery
rounds.

14:03.500 --> 14:08.490
Nor is he, as my sergeant
has discovered,
the only telegraph boy to do so.

14:08.500 --> 14:11.490
Are you among them?
Certainly not.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.490
Each to their own, mind you.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.490
I myself am partial to a tight
mimsy.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.490
A rosy notch.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.490
A dewy flower.

14:19.500 --> 14:24.490
You and David are in straits.
Otto Roberts is dead because of it.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.490
Do you feel no guilt?
An innocent boy lies slain.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.500
Innocent?

14:30.500 --> 14:31.500
Yes.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.500
Though you'd shackle him,
would you not?

14:35.500 --> 14:38.500
Catamite. Sodomite. Pervert.

14:39.500 --> 14:43.500
A moral bankrupt fit for your
shackles.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.490
Are you gonna be charging me
with aught, sir?
I've got a shift coming up

14:48.500 --> 14:50.500
and people do need their telegrams.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.490
- Toodle-pip, sirs.
- Off he goes, then.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.490
Proud Polly Prick-tickler.

15:04.500 --> 15:08.490
Gamahuching his way through every
molly house back to St Martin's.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.500
Are we short of homosexuals
wasting our cell space, Sergeant?

15:12.500 --> 15:13.490
We could have broken him, sir.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.500
There's an egg in the box
with a far softer shell.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.490
- You run them. Confess it.
- No, sir!

15:21.500 --> 15:25.500
Yes, sir! You pander and pimp those
boys, who ought to be safe in your
care.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.490
They swing for such, do they not,
Sergeant? Indecent predators

15:29.500 --> 15:30.490
of our noble youth.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.490
They swing in agony, sir, and justly
so.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.490
I run nothing!

15:34.500 --> 15:37.500
I just...I just try to do my job.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.490
I want to move upstairs,
learn to...to use the wire.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.490
Which boys are the renters?
I don't know.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.490
Not all, just...
David Goodbody.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.490
Otto Roberts. Vincent Featherwell.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.490
Who else? Who else?!
There are others.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.490
What else were David and Vincent
involved in?

15:53.500 --> 15:55.490
Your friend, Otto Roberts,

15:55.500 --> 15:57.490
was killed in David's place.
If you seek any kind of justice

15:57.500 --> 15:59.500
for him, you speak.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.490
David, there's...there's a man he
sees.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.490
A well-to-do. I've heard
David and Vincent talk of him.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.490
His...love for David,

16:09.500 --> 16:12.490
and how they might...capitalise.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.490
Blackmail?
I don't know.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.500
But it wouldn't be the first time.

16:17.500 --> 16:20.490
This man of David's, who is he?
A banker, sir.

16:20.500 --> 16:24.490
Name of Quint. Solomon Quint.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.490
Quint, Solomon.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.490
He's at the House of Barings, sir.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.500
Get me a hansom.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.490
Inspector Reid?
Franklin Stone. A pleasure.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.500
We can speak in my office.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.490
I hear you're looking for Sol Quint?

17:06.500 --> 17:08.490
I am. You work with him?
Mm, ten years.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.490
His work being what, exactly?

17:11.500 --> 17:13.500
You might call him a haruspex.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.490
In ancient times,
certain priests, haruspices,

17:17.500 --> 17:19.490
would examine the entrails
of sacrificed beasts,

17:19.500 --> 17:21.490
thus to determine
the fate of men and nations.

17:21.500 --> 17:28.490
Just so, Solomon Quint would sink
his hands into the grimy slew of
phenomena,

17:28.500 --> 17:30.490
economic, political and geographic,

17:30.500 --> 17:34.500
and, from what he found there,
determine our fortunes.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.490
Quite literally.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.500
Investments.
He would analyse investments?

17:41.500 --> 17:43.500
And the risks thereof.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.490
Can I offer you a refreshment?

17:50.500 --> 17:51.500
Thank you, no.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.500
Temperate man.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
Bravo.

18:00.500 --> 18:04.490
Forgive my flippancy, sir.
This has been a most difficult time.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.490
Sol left under something of a cloud.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.500
He's no longer with Barings?
Since when?

18:10.500 --> 18:12.500
Almost a week.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.490
His work had become...

18:16.500 --> 18:18.490
erratic.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.500
A man in his position
cannot afford to be erratic.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.500
Sol Quint was the most brilliant
of his kind, sir.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.500
Until, er...

18:31.500 --> 18:35.500
Well, he was a dear friend
and I'm not a man given to
indiscretion.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.500
But your candour is
much appreciated, sir.

18:45.500 --> 18:49.500
Suffice it to say Sol Quint's
marital bed was infrequently
troubled by his presence.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.490
He had certain pastimes.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.490
In truth, I think the man was
heartsick.

18:55.500 --> 19:00.490
Perhaps in every life, at some
point, we must make such a choice.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.500
What choice, Mr Stone?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.500
Between love and gold, Inspector.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.490
Love and gold.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.490
My duty is to the House of Barings.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.500
I have not...

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
..the luxury...

19:17.500 --> 19:19.500
..of placing anything before gold.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.500
Not even Sol Quint.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.500
I was obligated to dismiss him.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.490
If you'd oblige me, Mr Stone,
I shall need Mr Quint's address.

19:31.500 --> 19:36.500
My folio. You were simply to recover
my folio...

19:37.500 --> 19:39.490
..and now an innocent boy lies dead.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.490
No.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.500
Tell Mr Stone,
I...I need to see him.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.490
I can't...

19:49.500 --> 19:50.490
I cannot...

19:50.500 --> 19:52.500
They know, man!

19:53.500 --> 19:57.490
The boys know, and now double
would they wring from me!

19:57.500 --> 19:59.490
Chide me not, Mr Quint.

19:59.500 --> 20:03.500
It is to your mess
I endeavour to take my broom.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.500
My apologies.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.490
The older boy.

20:11.500 --> 20:15.490
Were you aware of his friendship
with the newspaperman Fred Best?

20:15.500 --> 20:17.500
Does...does Mr Stone know?

20:21.500 --> 20:22.500
Well, I must see him.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.500
This is our last chance to...

20:27.500 --> 20:29.490
..come forth open-handed
before the bank investors.

20:29.500 --> 20:34.500
Mr Stone would prefer
that all parties keep their counsel.

20:35.500 --> 20:41.500
It is fundamental, Mr Quint,
that you keep your counsel.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.500
Yes.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.500
Of course it is.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.500
I understand now why you came.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.490
I would have given David anything.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.500
Anything he asked. I...

20:59.500 --> 21:01.500
I loved him.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.500
I love him still.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.490
You must think me a bloody fool,
sir.

21:11.500 --> 21:16.500
I do not pretend to understand
the things that love makes men do.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.490
But every man I've known
has suffered for it.

21:19.500 --> 21:22.500
Yet what else is there, Mr Self?

21:23.500 --> 21:26.490
How else to know,

21:26.500 --> 21:27.490
even for a moment,

21:27.500 --> 21:29.500
that we live?

21:50.500 --> 21:51.490
What's this?
Charlie Frost.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.490
Paid back the money I loaned him.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.490
- At least that's something.
- You should have seen him.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.490
He was suited and booted.

21:58.500 --> 22:01.500
All in finery like a tailor's dummy.

22:02.500 --> 22:08.490
Susan, you remember when I was
talking about a way to get us out
from under?

22:08.500 --> 22:10.490
I'm trying to count.
Yeah, I know that, but listen.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.500
Look, can you see I'm trying to
count? Hey.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.500
What is it?

22:21.500 --> 22:23.500
Silas Duggan.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.500
Duggan. What about him?

22:28.500 --> 22:31.490
He wants more.
How much more?

22:31.500 --> 22:33.500
More than I have
and more than I can make.

22:34.500 --> 22:37.500
I can't take more from the girls.
I can't.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.490
He's squeezing us week by week.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.490
Darling, what if I was to tell you

22:42.500 --> 22:45.500
there was a way out of this
that didn't involve running?

22:48.500 --> 22:54.490
Now, Charlie Frost, he's no genius,
but Charlie Frost knows some people.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.500
There's a mine.

22:57.500 --> 23:00.490
Silver and copper.
The land is lousy with it.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.500
Charlie put in what little he had.
Within a week, 200.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.490
This is your notion of out from
under?

23:08.500 --> 23:10.490
To gamble what meagre pot
Silas Duggan does not extort?

23:10.500 --> 23:14.500
That's the beauty of it. It ain't
a gamble, and the value just soars.

23:18.500 --> 23:22.490
Ah, the man whose numeracy extends
to the price of liquor and tail,

23:22.500 --> 23:26.500
this man will make himself
a titan of high finance?

23:28.500 --> 23:29.500
All right.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.490
Just got to settle with Duggan my
way.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.490
You'll not settle anything with
Duggan.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.490
Oh, tell me, Susan, huh?
You tell me what to do.

23:39.500 --> 23:43.490
Tell me how I'm supposed to help
you, cos you kept this goddamn thing
a secret.

23:43.500 --> 23:44.490
Now the son of a bitch
is turning the screw.

23:44.500 --> 23:47.490
All I wanted was you and me.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.490
Don't. Should have done this from
the start.

23:49.500 --> 23:52.500
You don't know him.
He's about to know me.

24:07.500 --> 24:10.490
Duggan!

24:13.500 --> 24:15.500
Silas Duggan!

24:22.500 --> 24:25.490
Whiskers too, or just a trim
for the barnet, nice rub of oil?

24:25.500 --> 24:29.500
Oh, I'm not the one getting a
haircut, you chiselling piece of
shit.

24:31.500 --> 24:35.490
Out of my affections for your good
lady, I'm reluctant to post you home
in pieces.

24:35.500 --> 24:40.500
Leave now and we'll call this
parley... an idle fancy.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.500
Fancy?

24:45.500 --> 24:48.490
Duggan, I am real as hell. You've
had your last penny out of my lady.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.490
You try to squeeze one farthing
more...

24:49.500 --> 24:51.500
..I'm gonna see you paid in lead.

24:58.500 --> 25:03.490
You dare cross me, dare whisper the
name Silas Duggan to your police whip
cracker,

25:03.500 --> 25:06.490
dare even dream
about my handsome likeness...

25:08.500 --> 25:11.490
..I shall skin you from nose to
toes.

25:11.500 --> 25:15.490
Here shall I take my razor to your
pizzle, make a gelding of you.

25:15.500 --> 25:21.490
Have you stood by mewling, as I
spatchcock your wife upon my bunk.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.490
Now leave my shop, cowboy,

25:36.500 --> 25:39.500
and tell your whore mistress I shall
bill her for the broken glass.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.490
Mr Quint does all right for himself,
doesn't he, sir?

25:51.500 --> 25:53.490
Maybe I should become a banker.

25:53.500 --> 25:57.490
I'm just home from the dressmaker's.
I think he's in his study.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.500
Mr Quint?

26:01.500 --> 26:03.500
Mr Quint, it's the police.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.490
Inspector?

26:44.500 --> 26:45.500
If I may, sir.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.490
Sergeant, join me?

26:48.500 --> 26:51.490
Unless of course Mrs...Mrs Drake...

26:51.500 --> 26:53.490
Oh, no. No.

26:53.500 --> 26:56.490
Always time for just the one, sir.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.500
Hm.

27:03.500 --> 27:07.500
What is the purpose of our work,
Bennet?

27:08.500 --> 27:09.490
The law?

27:09.500 --> 27:11.490
In your opinion.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.500
To protect, sir.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.490
That's why I came to H Division,
to protect.

27:19.500 --> 27:24.490
A man, blackmailed by a boy
for illicit affection,

27:24.500 --> 27:27.490
takes anguished revenge on
another...

27:27.500 --> 27:30.490
and then, stricken with guilt,

27:30.500 --> 27:32.500
ends himself.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
So, whom did the law protect today?

27:38.500 --> 27:41.490
Far from protect, does it not occur
to you that, but for the law,

27:41.500 --> 27:44.500
both Solomon Quint and Otto Roberts
would be alive?

27:45.500 --> 27:47.500
What, then, sir?

27:48.500 --> 27:51.490
Do we choose the laws
we see fit to enforce?

27:51.500 --> 27:56.500
We have our obligations,
but our work today...

27:57.500 --> 28:00.500
..if Mr Quint is any example...

28:01.500 --> 28:03.490
..I begin to think a law that makes
a crime of human love

28:03.500 --> 28:06.490
will police itself in pure...

28:06.500 --> 28:07.500
despair.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.490
- They're for the lady.
- Thank you.

28:17.500 --> 28:18.500
There you go.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.500
They're so beautiful.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.500
You're quiet today.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.490
Forgive me, my love.

28:34.500 --> 28:38.490
The Inspector was turning
all philosophical on me.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.490
Gave me an 'eadache.

28:40.500 --> 28:44.500
We'll have words. Can't have him
wearing out that noggin.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.500
The law's the law, right?

28:51.500 --> 28:53.490
And policemen serve it.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.490
We don't ask all the whys
and wherefores, do we?

28:56.500 --> 28:58.490
Otherwise...well, what then?

28:58.500 --> 29:03.490
But the Inspector, when it comes
to banging up poofs and Mary Anns...

29:03.500 --> 29:07.500
To see him,
he's a man all scooped of belief.

29:09.500 --> 29:10.500
Do you believe in it?

29:12.500 --> 29:14.490
Hell's bells. Not you too?

29:14.500 --> 29:17.500
Maybe he just understands
what it is to be lonely.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.500
Say a law was made tomorrow...

29:22.500 --> 29:25.490
..for you to love me was a crime.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.500
They say it's filthy and unnatural.

29:29.500 --> 29:33.500
Would you stop, Bennet?
Turn off your love like a gas tap,
just to obey?

29:36.500 --> 29:39.490
I'd be the filthiest scofflaw
this land had ever seen.

29:39.500 --> 29:42.500
Eggs! Get your eggs!

29:43.500 --> 29:45.500
Bella?

29:46.500 --> 29:49.500
Bella, it's you.
You're mistaken.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.490
Who was that?
I don't know.

29:54.500 --> 29:55.490
She seemed to know you.

29:55.500 --> 29:59.490
There was a part of my life
before Tenter Street

29:59.500 --> 30:01.490
full of cruelty and sadness.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.490
She was a working girl?

30:03.500 --> 30:05.490
Please can we go home now, Bennet?
There's a chill.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.500
Of course, love.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.500
You look beautiful.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.500
You're drunk.

30:33.500 --> 30:36.500
I thought it before I was drunk,
and I'll think it after I'm dead.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.500
I've thought it every moment
since I first saw you.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.500
You're all the true beauty
in this world.

30:58.500 --> 30:59.490
You're bleeding.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.500
You remember.

31:02.500 --> 31:07.500
There was a night, me and you,
we took a balloon over Chicago.

31:10.500 --> 31:14.500
It was all laid out.
It was electric, the city.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.490
It was like starlight,
and I said some words to you.

31:18.500 --> 31:21.500
You swore you would
weave our lives together...

31:22.500 --> 31:24.490
..with threads of silk and gold.

31:24.500 --> 31:27.490
I made myself believe
that I could live up to you.

31:27.500 --> 31:30.500
I never cared about money.
It ain't about the money.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.490
I mean, what do I have to give you?
I got nothing left.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.490
I broke every promise I ever made
you, I brought you down to this.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.490
And now I can't even protect you.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.490
Matthew.
I ain't a man, Caitlin.

31:40.500 --> 31:41.490
Don't.
I'm not a man.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.490
Don't make this about your wounded
pride.

31:44.500 --> 31:47.500
I see the way you look at me.
Oh, you see nothing!

31:48.500 --> 31:52.500
The only thing you ever look to is
your next swashbuckling bloody
daydream.

31:54.500 --> 31:58.500
You finish your bottle.
I will not indulge your self-pity.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.500
They're in.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.500
Come here.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.500
I've been worried sick, Harry.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.500
Flight!

33:51.500 --> 33:54.490
Suicide, huh?
And the gun was in this hand?

33:54.500 --> 33:55.490
Yes.

33:55.500 --> 33:59.490
Phalanges of the digitus
medius and secondus.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.490
Multiple fractures.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.490
Could he pull the trigger?
With broken fingers?

34:04.500 --> 34:06.490
He's forced to write a note.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.489
Crack. Gun's jammed in his hand.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.489
Boom.

34:11.500 --> 34:14.500
Whoever wanted Mr Quint dead,
it sure as hell wasn't Mr Quint.

34:22.500 --> 34:25.500
Madam, I understand this is a, er...

34:26.500 --> 34:29.500
..painful time for you,
so forgive my bluntness.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.489
Was your husband a man with enemies?

34:34.500 --> 34:36.500
Only himself.

34:37.500 --> 34:41.489
I no longer believe
his death to be suicide.

34:41.500 --> 34:45.489
Can you help me understand
who might have killed him?

34:45.500 --> 34:48.500
I...I have no idea. He...

34:50.500 --> 34:51.489
..he was a gentle man.

34:51.500 --> 34:55.489
I spoke to Franklin Stone
at Barings yesterday.

34:55.500 --> 35:01.500
He intimated you and Mr Quint might
have been facing certain...marital
issues.

35:03.500 --> 35:07.490
Sol and I were married for 20 years,
and we loved each other, Inspector.

35:07.500 --> 35:10.490
If Sol had issues, they were
with Franklin Stone and not me.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.490
What issues?
I know not.

35:12.500 --> 35:15.500
"A matter of gravest principle,"
was all he said.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.490
Some work he'd been conducting,
regarding the Argentine.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.490
May I see this work?

35:21.500 --> 35:23.500
All his files are at the House of
Barings.

35:24.500 --> 35:28.490
He had some, but...some days ago
his folio was stolen.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.500
And he did not report it?

35:33.500 --> 35:35.500
I believe the culprit was...

35:36.500 --> 35:39.500
..someone whose acquaintance
he sought not to expose.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.500
A boy.

35:45.500 --> 35:48.500
Do not judge him, Inspector Reid.
I do no such thing.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.490
This boy.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.490
David, David Goodbody?

35:55.500 --> 35:57.500
I wouldn't know.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.490
My husband was a private man,

36:02.500 --> 36:06.500
and there were things
he saw fit not to share with me.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.490
But I was never lied to, nor deceived
by him. Our marriage was...

36:10.500 --> 36:11.500
An arrangement?

36:13.500 --> 36:15.490
..a companionship.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.490
And a loving one.

36:18.500 --> 36:22.490
We each wanted for the other
happiness, wherever that may be
found,

36:22.500 --> 36:26.500
and what is love, sir, if not that?

36:30.500 --> 36:32.490
Quint's dead?
How does Fred Best know?

36:32.500 --> 36:34.490
He talks to the coppers.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
He says Quint was killed and...

36:38.500 --> 36:40.500
Cunny bastard whores!

36:45.500 --> 36:47.490
I'm sorry.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.490
Why?

36:49.500 --> 36:51.490
This should have been so easy.
It isn't over yet.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.500
Quint's dead, David.

36:55.500 --> 36:58.500
What's he gonna pay us now?
He's dead because they're afraid.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.490
What we have is dangerous,
and they know it

37:02.500 --> 37:06.490
and they want us to be afraid also.
You said we can do this.

37:06.500 --> 37:09.500
You made me believe it,
and I believe it still.

37:12.500 --> 37:15.490
Then we take 'em on?

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
We give 'em true cause to tremble.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.490
I want those boys back in here.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.490
Flight said Vincent was
hugger-mugger with Fred Best.
See what he knows.

37:26.500 --> 37:27.500
Sir.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
A word in your...

37:38.500 --> 37:40.500
Left in an hurry, did we?

37:43.500 --> 37:45.500
From Vincent.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.490
My name is David Goodbody.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.500
I wish to speak to Inspector Reid.

38:07.500 --> 38:10.490
My sergeant saw you
selling yourself to a man.

38:10.500 --> 38:14.490
Rather reckless of you now,
to present yourself thus.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.500
I believe in justice, sir.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.490
I have information...
concerning Mr Quint.

38:21.500 --> 38:26.490
One of your sexual partners, is he
not? The victim of your blackmail?

38:26.500 --> 38:28.490
Mr Quint and I only talked...

38:28.500 --> 38:30.490
Ah.
..sir. It isn't a crime, is it,

38:30.500 --> 38:33.490
for a lonely man
to find brief peace in talk?

38:33.500 --> 38:35.500
No, not yet.

38:36.500 --> 38:39.490
His folio was stolen.
Would you know anything about that?

38:39.500 --> 38:40.490
No, sir.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.490
And this talk concerned what?

38:42.500 --> 38:44.500
He was afraid.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.490
Said they were against him.

38:46.500 --> 38:49.490
Who?
Said they'd destroyed his files,

38:49.500 --> 38:53.490
and would cut out his tongue
just because he told the truth.

38:53.500 --> 38:56.490
Who, boy?
Who is it would silence him?

38:56.500 --> 38:58.500
I came here of my own accord, sir.

39:00.500 --> 39:01.500
Will I be free to leave as such?

39:03.500 --> 39:05.490
It is a dangerous game
you play, David.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.490
We do what we have to, sir.

39:06.500 --> 39:09.490
Why?
Love.

39:09.500 --> 39:12.500
Vincent?
My love is unnameable.

39:16.500 --> 39:19.490
You tell me who Quint feared,
then you may leave.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.500
He mentioned the name Franklin.

39:22.500 --> 39:25.490
Franklin Stone.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.490
And the burden of Argentina.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.490
That accusation is absurd.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.490
I make no accusation,
Mr Stone, merely enquiry.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.490
I paid Sol Quint to report.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.490
What possible interest could I have
in destroying his work?

39:35.500 --> 39:38.490
That, sir, is my enquiry.

39:38.500 --> 39:41.500
Perhaps his analysis proved...
incommodious.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.490
Concerning the Argentine,
for instance.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.500
I believe this house had
significant investment there.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.490
Perhaps you would like
to share with me

39:52.500 --> 39:54.490
the name of he who flings
such night soil at my door.

39:54.500 --> 39:58.490
Perhaps you would share with me
Mr Quint's recent work.

39:58.500 --> 40:01.500
I should like full access to his
files.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.500
Of course.

40:08.500 --> 40:12.490
However, there is
the small matter of due process.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.490
After all, Sol's death occurred
in Hampstead, did it not,

40:14.500 --> 40:17.490
which is the jurisdiction
of S Division,

40:17.500 --> 40:20.490
and we here fall under City of London
policing, not you...

40:21.500 --> 40:22.490
..Metropolitan fellows.

40:22.500 --> 40:26.490
See, the information in our files
is very sensitive, Inspector.

40:26.500 --> 40:29.490
I really must insist on having
the correct warrants and assurances.

40:29.500 --> 40:32.490
If it would be of any help, I could
enquire of Commissioner Bradford.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.500
I'll be seeing him at my
club...later.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.500
I understand Mr Quint's folio
went missing of late.

40:43.500 --> 40:48.500
Must be bothersome to such
an assiduous custodian of his work.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.500
Let's both hope it turns up soon,
shall we?

41:05.500 --> 41:07.490
They told me the police would come.

41:07.500 --> 41:11.490
They bloody telegraphed me,
those sodomites.

41:11.500 --> 41:14.500
Make a fool of me,
and they will ruin this bank.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.500
I need more time.

41:20.500 --> 41:21.500
I need you to get me more time.

41:27.500 --> 41:28.500
Freddie.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.490
How's that mutton cooking?

41:32.500 --> 41:36.490
Fred, listen to me.
If anything should happen...

41:36.500 --> 41:37.490
What?

41:37.500 --> 41:40.490
Look, tell me what you've gotten
into.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.490
Eh? Even your telegram
sounded shit-scared.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.500
If they come for David and me,
there's a folio.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.500
Take it. Publish it.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.500
Where?
It's stashed.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.500
Where?!

42:09.500 --> 42:12.490
Hold up, jug-ear. Where's the Mary
Ann? I know you've been meeting up.

42:12.500 --> 42:14.490
Help him, please! Please help him!
What?

42:14.500 --> 42:16.490
Go! Where?!

42:16.500 --> 42:17.500
He's down by the tannery!

42:32.500 --> 42:34.500
Oh! Aah!

43:01.500 --> 43:03.500
Aah! Aah! Aah!

43:09.500 --> 43:11.490
Shit.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.490
Go.

43:28.500 --> 43:31.490
The documents.

43:31.500 --> 43:33.490
Give them to Fred.
You will not die. You will not die.

43:33.500 --> 43:36.490
Now! Fred!

43:36.500 --> 43:39.490
Go! Now.

43:39.500 --> 43:40.490
I won't leave you.

43:40.500 --> 43:43.500
I want...

43:44.500 --> 43:47.490
..a hammock made of silk

43:47.500 --> 43:49.490
in warm sun.

43:49.500 --> 43:52.490
I want you to stay with me.

43:52.500 --> 43:53.500
Please...

44:12.500 --> 44:14.500
I, James Self...

44:15.500 --> 44:17.490
..hereby confess to the murders

44:17.500 --> 44:22.500
of Otto Roberts, Solomon Quint
and Vincent Featherwell.

44:24.500 --> 44:26.490
I killed them

44:26.500 --> 44:28.490
of my own full accord

44:28.500 --> 44:30.490
for reasons

44:30.500 --> 44:33.490
spiteful and indecent.

44:33.500 --> 44:36.500
Bull! You killed on orders.

44:37.500 --> 44:40.500
You wish to avoid the noose,
you will give me a name.

44:42.500 --> 44:45.500
I killed them of my own full
accord...

44:46.500 --> 44:49.490
..for reasons spiteful and indecent.

44:49.500 --> 44:53.490
You are no less a messenger boy
than Roberts and Featherwell.

44:53.500 --> 44:57.490
And did they ever question
those by whom they were sent,

44:57.500 --> 45:00.490
or seek to comprehend
the message they delivered?

45:00.500 --> 45:01.490
For whom do you kill?

45:01.500 --> 45:04.490
Franklin Stone?

45:04.500 --> 45:05.490
Why lay down your life?

45:05.500 --> 45:11.490
Do you see, I am all that stands
between you and the rope? Tell me!

45:11.500 --> 45:16.490
On my death, all I have,
plus a settlement of insurance,

45:16.500 --> 45:17.500
will be directed to my boy.

45:19.500 --> 45:21.490
Do you understand, law man?

45:21.500 --> 45:25.490
The one goodness I may achieve
in this wretched life

45:25.500 --> 45:27.500
will be the timely leaving of it.

45:30.500 --> 45:32.500
Bring me your rope.

45:41.500 --> 45:43.500
How is he?
How would you be?

45:50.500 --> 45:51.500
David.

45:53.500 --> 45:57.490
David, the man who killed Vincent
and Otto and Mr Quint,

45:57.500 --> 45:59.490
he will not talk to me,

45:59.500 --> 46:02.500
and so I need you
to tell me all that you can.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.500
We needed money.

46:09.500 --> 46:10.490
We serviced men.

46:10.500 --> 46:14.490
Sometimes, if there was an
opportunity, we'd filch something,

46:14.500 --> 46:18.490
a pocketbook, a briefcase,

46:18.500 --> 46:20.490
then ransom it back.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.500
The money was nothing to them...

46:23.500 --> 46:26.490
..next to the world knowing them
for who they were.

46:26.500 --> 46:27.500
And you took Mr Quint's folio?

46:30.500 --> 46:33.500
But Vincent knew
this was different.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.500
Mr Quint's work was...

46:38.500 --> 46:40.490
Vincent said
it would make England shake.

46:40.500 --> 46:43.490
The Argentine was crumbling and...
What about the Argentine?

46:43.500 --> 46:45.490
I don't know.

46:45.500 --> 46:49.490
He just said it wouldn't hold,
that Mr Quint saw a storm coming.

46:49.500 --> 46:51.500
That's a goddamn lie.
Jackson, Jackson.

46:53.500 --> 46:56.490
We just wanted to be free!
David.

46:56.500 --> 46:58.490
David, where is Mr Quint's work?

47:00.500 --> 47:02.500
Where?

47:13.500 --> 47:16.490
What is it, Reid?
Is it about the Argentine?

47:16.500 --> 47:18.490
The country's in debt. Vast debt.

47:18.500 --> 47:21.490
They borrowed to cover themselves,
underwritten by the House of
Barings.

47:21.500 --> 47:23.490
Argentina has run out of gold.
They can't pay.

47:23.500 --> 47:25.490
Quint saw how deeply Barings was
exposed.

47:25.500 --> 47:27.490
What the hell are you saying?

47:27.500 --> 47:29.490
It's Quint's storm.
It's a massive default.

47:29.500 --> 47:31.490
All investment in that country
is about to become worthless.

47:31.500 --> 47:34.490
That's...that...that's horse shit.
There's silver and there's copper
in...

47:34.500 --> 47:37.500
The country's bankrupt,
man. Look, it's all here in
black and white. Look.

47:39.500 --> 47:42.500
What, you have interests there?
Since when?

47:45.500 --> 47:49.490
Stone was allowing the bubble
to inflate. He was fuelling it.

47:49.500 --> 47:50.490
Why, sir?

47:50.500 --> 47:54.500
Ever more investment,
ever more for the bank.
Quint kept their correspondence.

47:55.500 --> 48:00.490
Sir, all of this,
it's as crooked as fish hooks

48:00.500 --> 48:03.500
but how does it give us proof of
murder?

48:05.500 --> 48:07.500
This!

48:08.500 --> 48:11.490
This is what you have been hunting
and killed for.

48:11.500 --> 48:14.490
You know as well as I, you have
no proof of any crime at my hand.

48:14.500 --> 48:15.490
James Self will break.

48:15.500 --> 48:17.500
I know not a fellow by that name...

48:20.500 --> 48:22.490
..and the only thing you can prove

48:22.500 --> 48:25.490
is I acted in the best interests
of my bank and its investors.

48:25.500 --> 48:27.490
By lying to them?

48:27.500 --> 48:29.490
By burying this?

48:29.500 --> 48:33.490
How could you believe
you'd avert disaster
by denying it was happening?

48:33.500 --> 48:35.490
Not denying. Delaying.

48:35.500 --> 48:38.490
An hour ago, I concluded the last
of my meetings with Lord Rothschild

48:38.500 --> 48:40.490
and the Governor of the Bank of
England.

48:40.500 --> 48:42.490
They have agreed a loan sufficient
to cover the debts of this House.

48:42.500 --> 48:48.500
Had they not done so, had news of our
exposure in Argentina become known...

48:55.500 --> 48:57.490
Do you not comprehend the nexus, sir?

48:57.500 --> 49:00.490
The connections inexorable of this
age?

49:00.500 --> 49:04.490
Do you imagine the telegram wires
encircling our globe

49:04.500 --> 49:07.490
are like angels' harp strings
thrumming gently?

49:07.500 --> 49:08.490
They are a garrotte, sir.

49:08.500 --> 49:11.490
They necessitate
unorthodox stratagems for survival.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.500
Had news broken earlier,
Barings would have been ruined.

49:16.500 --> 49:18.490
Bank runs would have
spread like the plague.

49:18.500 --> 49:23.500
The economic heartbeat of our city...
country, Empire, convulsing.

49:26.500 --> 49:30.500
Would you have the whole world
wear the rags of Whitechapel?

49:33.500 --> 49:34.490
I saved this bank.

49:34.500 --> 49:37.490
And what of your investors
beyond this bank,

49:37.500 --> 49:40.490
blindly stacking their livelihoods
upon your pyre?

49:40.500 --> 49:41.490
You sound like Sol Quint,

49:41.500 --> 49:45.500
and my obligations are not to them,
but to this House.

49:46.500 --> 49:50.500
Then let the world see
how this House does business.

49:51.500 --> 49:53.500
Your naivety demeans you.

49:58.500 --> 50:02.490
Those whose fortunes I have saved
are free to think ill of me,

50:02.500 --> 50:04.500
to shun me at the club...

50:05.500 --> 50:08.500
..to divest themselves
of their sullied funds...

50:09.500 --> 50:15.500
..in tender compassion give every
squalid pound to their stricken
fellow men.

50:17.500 --> 50:20.490
Do you imagine they will? No.

50:20.500 --> 50:25.500
Because love and justice are not
the primal forces of our world, sir.

50:27.500 --> 50:30.490
Gold is the primal force of our
world.

50:30.500 --> 50:34.500
You believe, as Sol did,
in right and wrong, but there is
only...

50:35.500 --> 50:37.500
..profit and loss.

50:39.500 --> 50:41.500
You believe in laws...

50:43.500 --> 50:45.500
..but there are only ledgers.

50:46.500 --> 50:49.490
Would that it were otherwise,
Inspector Reid.

50:49.500 --> 50:51.500
Would that it were.

50:52.500 --> 50:56.490
Would that my friend
worked down the hallway still,

50:56.500 --> 50:59.500
free to take lunch with me
every Friday...

51:02.500 --> 51:04.500
..as was our wont.

51:06.500 --> 51:09.500
We all have our obligations.
Yes, Mr Stone.

51:10.500 --> 51:12.500
That we do.

51:25.500 --> 51:28.500
It is a meagre justice gets meted
today.

51:29.500 --> 51:32.490
But if the world may not know
Franklin Stone for a murderer,

51:32.500 --> 51:35.500
let them know him
for a merchant of fraud and greed.

51:38.500 --> 51:41.500
I'll serve up that bastard's head,
stuffed with an apple.

51:45.500 --> 51:47.490
This will take you as far as the
station.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.500
From there your path is your own.

51:50.500 --> 51:53.490
Vincent and I were in love.

51:53.500 --> 51:56.490
There is no path without him
worth treading.

51:56.500 --> 51:59.500
Yet tread on we must,
one step at a time.

52:01.500 --> 52:03.500
Good luck, David.

52:10.500 --> 52:15.490
You took my money and gambled
it on an empty hole in Argentina.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.500
Get it back.

52:18.500 --> 52:19.490
I tried.

52:19.500 --> 52:22.500
I talked to Charlie.
Uh...yeah, he's in deep too.

52:26.500 --> 52:29.500
We can't get it back.
Nobody can. It's, er...

52:31.500 --> 52:32.490
..it's gone.

52:32.500 --> 52:33.500
It's gone?

52:37.500 --> 52:40.500
Jesus, Caitlin. Scream at me.
Scratch my eyes out.

52:42.500 --> 52:43.500
Throw something.

52:44.500 --> 52:48.490
I'll never give you
a scrap of feeling ever again.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.500
I was just trying to get us out.

52:51.500 --> 52:52.500
You get out.

52:56.500 --> 52:57.490
Did you hear me?

52:57.500 --> 53:00.490
Put down my whisky and get out.

53:00.500 --> 53:02.490
I'm gonna think of something, OK?
I swear...

53:02.500 --> 53:06.490
From this moment, I don't care
what you think or swear or do.

53:06.500 --> 53:07.490
You betrayed me.

53:07.500 --> 53:12.490
Do you have any idea what
you've done? You betrayed me.

53:12.500 --> 53:17.500
You took our money, which I made,
and you threw it away.

53:21.500 --> 53:23.500
You were right about one thing.

53:24.500 --> 53:25.500
You aren't a man.

53:28.500 --> 53:30.500
Get out.

54:26.500 --> 54:29.500
Miss Cobden,
I hope you'll excuse the hour.

54:31.500 --> 54:32.500
It is excused, Inspector.

54:35.500 --> 54:40.490
You see, I, er...I have of late
had cause for...reflection.

54:40.500 --> 54:43.490
Would you care to sit,

54:43.500 --> 54:46.500
or would you prefer to share the
results of your ruminations from the
threshold?

54:52.500 --> 54:57.500
It is a rare thing to find a friend
in this world, a...a true friend.

54:59.500 --> 55:02.500
Rarer still one that might...
become more.

55:07.500 --> 55:11.500
There are some that do
and risk all for it...

55:12.500 --> 55:14.490
..and, even though the world
and all its might

55:14.500 --> 55:17.490
might seek to snuff out
their...love...

55:17.500 --> 55:21.490
they burn with it, fierce and
bright, like the sun.

55:21.500 --> 55:23.490
The love that I have known,

55:23.500 --> 55:26.500
the strength needed of me was not
there.

55:28.500 --> 55:31.500
I failed, er...

55:34.500 --> 55:37.500
..I failed my wife, Miss Cobden.

55:38.500 --> 55:40.500
I would not have that pain
visited upon you.

55:42.500 --> 55:45.490
You said the past was
naught but black magnetism.

55:45.500 --> 55:47.490
If I allowed, you would help me
resist it.

55:47.500 --> 55:49.500
I have...

55:50.500 --> 55:52.500
..had enough of the darkness...

55:55.500 --> 55:57.500
..if you would help me know the sun.

56:00.500 --> 56:02.500
Well, Edmund...

56:03.500 --> 56:07.490
..I do hope you're not going
to launch into sonnets

56:07.500 --> 56:09.500
every time you wish to take me
for dinner and a dance.

56:14.500 --> 56:17.500
I should find all the swooning
quite tiresome.

56:31.500 --> 56:34.490
I will not be your mistress.
I will not stand

56:34.500 --> 56:37.490
for shady encounters
and stolen assignations.

56:37.500 --> 56:41.500
I, er...I cannot divorce...
Nor do I ask that.

56:43.500 --> 56:46.500
But if we are to burn
fierce as the sun...

56:48.500 --> 56:51.500
..then I should have us share our
light with the world entire.

57:02.500 --> 57:04.500
Shall we?

57:26.500 --> 57:28.490
Name me a price, boy.

57:28.500 --> 57:30.490
It's named.

57:53.500 --> 57:56.490
A bed for the night, Maggie, that's
all.

57:56.500 --> 57:58.490
Each soul here,
when first they came,

57:58.500 --> 57:59.500
had reason never to trust again.

58:01.500 --> 58:04.490
It's the bloody Jews! Hang the noose
around the lot of the kike bastards!

58:04.500 --> 58:07.490
Whoever seeks to set Jew
against Gentile would do the same
for the Irish.

58:07.500 --> 58:10.490
Your love for him is not real, Bella.
It is.

58:10.500 --> 58:11.490
No, it is not.

58:11.500 --> 58:13.490
Who are you?

58:13.500 --> 58:14.490
Will you have at me with your billy
club?

58:14.500 --> 58:17.490
Bennet, no! Leave him be.
I'll explain.

58:17.500 --> 58:18.500
I saw her, Bennet, with a man.

58:19.305 --> 58:25.827
