<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick</b>.</font>

00:44.364 --> 00:46.699
Get outta my way!

00:46.733 --> 00:47.767
I called dibs!

00:49.702 --> 00:52.605
- Are those what I think they are?
- Wow!

00:52.639 --> 00:56.009
Oh, boy, I had to be late on cookie day!

00:56.043 --> 00:57.610
Cookie? Cookie? Cookie?

00:58.578 --> 01:00.513
- Here they come!
- Ah, it's crumb time!

01:00.547 --> 01:02.082
- I want a piece!
- Cookies! Cookies!

01:03.550 --> 01:04.751
They're at it already!

01:04.784 --> 01:06.718
- Out of my way! I want it!
- Hey, can I squeeze in, guys?

01:06.719 --> 01:09.289
- I've got beaks to feed!
- Snooze, you lose, Robert!

01:09.322 --> 01:11.024
- Oh...
- I want that cookie!

01:11.058 --> 01:12.459
- Hey!
- I called it!

01:12.492 --> 01:13.493
Snooze, you lose!

01:15.128 --> 01:17.530
- No touchbacks!
- Hey, no elbows!

01:17.564 --> 01:18.731
Oh!

01:20.700 --> 01:22.669
Aha!

01:22.702 --> 01:26.573
Come to papa! Ha! Score!

01:26.606 --> 01:29.342
- Wow!
- Yeah!

01:34.781 --> 01:38.051
Come on wings, don't fail me!
Don't want to miss it!

01:43.223 --> 01:44.424
My fellow storks.

01:44.457 --> 01:46.593
Now that we all have nested,

01:46.626 --> 01:49.529
we must concentrate on
the education of our offspring.

01:51.298 --> 01:52.599
Almost there!

01:52.632 --> 01:54.401
- The migration... Watch out!
- Whoa!

01:54.434 --> 01:57.337
- Incoming!
- Whoa! Oops! Oh!

01:57.370 --> 01:59.172
Sorry! Very late.

01:59.206 --> 02:02.142
Sparrows!

02:04.244 --> 02:06.713
Made it! Come on, cookie, let's do this.

02:06.746 --> 02:09.149
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?

02:09.181 --> 02:12.219
Don't worry, hon, you're just in time.

02:12.252 --> 02:13.620
Aw, and you brought a treat.

02:13.653 --> 02:15.722
To celebrate our new arrival!

02:20.293 --> 02:22.395
Richard, your Dad's here!

02:22.429 --> 02:26.266
Ha ha, he looks just like
I did at that age.

02:26.299 --> 02:28.868
Yeah, that's my boy.

02:28.901 --> 02:31.638
He definitely has your impatience.

02:31.671 --> 02:35.608
Looks like he's got
your pecking skills too!

02:35.642 --> 02:37.877
Come on. You can do it!

02:37.910 --> 02:40.113
Push, Richard. Push!

02:42.782 --> 02:44.817
Robert!

02:44.851 --> 02:47.287
Oh!

02:49.356 --> 02:51.391
You chose the wrong day, buddy!

03:25.392 --> 03:26.659
Oh?

03:37.537 --> 03:39.739
Ooh...

03:46.713 --> 03:48.248
Who have we here?

03:50.350 --> 03:52.485
Richard.

03:52.519 --> 03:55.522
Well, hello, Richard. I am Aurora.

04:00.360 --> 04:03.162
Shh... it's all right.

04:04.497 --> 04:05.865
Here.

04:08.235 --> 04:09.236
Mmm!

04:09.269 --> 04:12.905
That's good, isn't it?

04:12.939 --> 04:14.441
Where are your parents?

04:17.677 --> 04:19.379
Oh.

04:19.411 --> 04:20.813
Mommy!

04:20.846 --> 04:23.350
- Oh, I am not your...
- Mmm...

04:23.383 --> 04:27.220
Oh... come here.

04:27.254 --> 04:30.223
Mm... What am I gonna do with you?

04:40.267 --> 04:41.868
Hold on tight, Richard.

04:59.352 --> 05:00.620
Wow!

05:12.732 --> 05:14.967
No fish? What's in here? Frogs?

05:15.001 --> 05:16.436
No, Max, this is...

05:22.008 --> 05:24.411
Claudius, my dear.

05:24.444 --> 05:28.415
One of those pesky sparrows nearly
ruined my speech at the gathering!

05:28.448 --> 05:29.882
Mmm?

05:29.916 --> 05:32.785
Pests! What's for dinner?

05:32.819 --> 05:34.520
There is something I wanted
to talk to you about...

05:34.521 --> 05:35.755
Daddy!

05:35.788 --> 05:40.327
Aaah! Get off! Aurora!

05:40.360 --> 05:44.063
- Claudius, Max, this is...
- Get it off!

05:44.096 --> 05:46.299
- Richard!
- Off! Off, off, off!

05:46.333 --> 05:48.635
What is he doing here?

05:53.506 --> 05:55.642
He's fun! Can he stay for dinner?

05:55.675 --> 05:59.679
Certainly not.
Get this feathered leech off me!

05:59.712 --> 06:02.449
Go play with him, Max.

06:02.482 --> 06:04.684
Wanna go for a ride, Richard?

06:04.717 --> 06:06.486
- Max!
- Whoo!

06:15.395 --> 06:18.331
I found him alone in his nest.

06:18.365 --> 06:22.335
Sparrows. Stork parents
would never leave a chick!

06:22.369 --> 06:24.404
They didn't have a choice, Claudius.

06:24.437 --> 06:27.507
Their nest was... was ravaged.

06:27.540 --> 06:28.708
Oh...

06:28.741 --> 06:31.778
Still, this is none of our business.

06:31.811 --> 06:32.945
Take him back.

06:32.979 --> 06:35.648
I won't, my dear. I can't.

06:36.783 --> 06:40.453
Imagine if it was our son,
all alone in the woods.

06:40.487 --> 06:43.723
Hold on, kid. Turbulence ahead!

06:43.756 --> 06:45.525
Whoa!

06:45.558 --> 06:48.628
Where'd you go?

06:48.661 --> 06:51.464
All right. The sparrow can stay.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.633
I knew you would understand...

06:53.666 --> 06:56.035
Only... till the Fall.

06:56.068 --> 06:59.639
After that, he'll have to
look after himself. Agreed?

06:59.672 --> 07:01.040
And...

07:01.073 --> 07:03.410
I don't want the other storks
to know about this.

07:03.443 --> 07:05.512
And...

07:05.545 --> 07:07.514
he doesn't call me "Daddy".

07:07.547 --> 07:09.382
- Daddy!
- Mm?

07:09.416 --> 07:12.151
Look what I taught him!

07:12.184 --> 07:16.155
Hee, hee.

07:16.188 --> 07:18.925
Whoa!

07:32.439 --> 07:34.707
Whoa! Crazy, Max!

07:34.741 --> 07:38.077
- Can't handle it, little brother?
- Oh, I can handle it!

07:38.110 --> 07:40.880
- Ha ha.
- Faster, Max! Faster!

07:42.449 --> 07:45.552
Oh... oh... whoa!

07:45.585 --> 07:47.554
I meant that!

07:47.587 --> 07:48.921
- Sure you did!
- Whoa!

07:52.625 --> 07:54.393
Mm-hmm. But silent, okay?

08:02.001 --> 08:05.572
- I got it!
- Well done, my boy.

08:05.605 --> 08:07.640
That doesn't look so hard...

08:10.009 --> 08:11.511
Oh...

08:15.682 --> 08:16.682
Gotcha!

08:19.619 --> 08:21.488
Eeeh! Gross! Hmm.

08:25.257 --> 08:27.594
Whoa! Richard! Flying fish!

08:27.627 --> 08:29.629
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah...
- Incoming!

08:29.662 --> 08:31.664
Ugh! I got it!

08:46.646 --> 08:50.016
Oh... oh...

08:50.049 --> 08:51.984
Nice!

08:52.018 --> 08:54.521
Hmm?

08:56.689 --> 08:58.491
Sorry, I fell out of bed.

09:07.834 --> 09:11.671
Come on, Max, I thought you were fast!

09:11.704 --> 09:13.506
Fast? I'll show you fast!

09:13.540 --> 09:16.275
Whatever you say, big brother!
I'm waiting!

09:16.308 --> 09:19.646
- I've almost got you!
- Ha ha, that's what you think!

09:19.679 --> 09:21.714
- Watch this!
- Richard!

09:21.748 --> 09:27.720
- Catch me if you can!
- The trees... they're so small!

09:27.754 --> 09:30.289
Hey! We're not allowed to go that high!

09:30.322 --> 09:33.059
Come on. Whoa!
You worry too much!

09:33.092 --> 09:36.563
No, it's too windy! Let's turn around.

09:36.596 --> 09:38.831
Chicken! A cool breeze
never hurt anyone.

09:38.865 --> 09:43.235
- Richard!
- Ah! Me and my big mouth!

09:43.269 --> 09:44.637
Gotcha!

09:47.574 --> 09:49.676
You didn't get me.

09:49.709 --> 09:51.611
- I came to you.
- Ha ha, oh, yeah?

09:51.644 --> 09:55.715
I was nose-diving, beanpole!
Good catch, though.

09:59.619 --> 10:02.889
- Dad's calling!
- Let's go!

10:11.297 --> 10:14.333
Why can't we take Richard with us?

10:14.366 --> 10:17.203
I mean, he's no burden,
and I could carry...

10:17.236 --> 10:19.706
Oh, be reasonable, Aurora.

10:19.739 --> 10:22.709
You knew this day would come.

10:26.212 --> 10:31.718
You are a wonderful mother, and
you have done all you can for him.

10:31.751 --> 10:34.921
But he won't survive
the journey to Africa.

10:34.954 --> 10:38.224
He has to live the life of a sparrow.

10:39.726 --> 10:42.094
Here we are. What's this all about?

10:42.128 --> 10:44.764
Finally! I've summoned the flock.

10:44.797 --> 10:47.767
- Come, Max.
- Hey, what about me?

10:47.800 --> 10:51.671
- I'm coming too, right?
- Hmm. Richard...

10:51.704 --> 10:54.273
Wait here until we return, all right?

10:54.306 --> 10:58.778
- What?! Why?!
- Do as you are told.

10:58.811 --> 11:01.147
- But we go everywhere together!
- Yeah, Mom!

11:01.180 --> 11:04.116
I'll explain everything
later. I promise.

11:04.150 --> 11:06.886
This is not fair!

11:06.919 --> 11:10.256
Max! Quit your lollygagging!

11:21.100 --> 11:24.236
Ahem. My fellow storks.

11:24.270 --> 11:29.408
Today, the old oak
has dropped its first leaf.

11:29.441 --> 11:32.645
The time of the great
migration has arrived.

11:32.679 --> 11:37.149
Citizens, we must migrate
before the winter comes.

11:37.183 --> 11:41.153
We will form a flock and fly south
to the Great Lake in Africa.

11:41.187 --> 11:44.323
Wow! Africa!

11:44.356 --> 11:46.826
Our journey is long and dangerous.

11:46.859 --> 11:48.928
- Oh, no no no no...
- And we...

11:48.961 --> 11:51.731
Mm?

11:55.001 --> 11:58.370
Hehe, hi there!

11:58.404 --> 12:01.774
- Richard!
- You know this bird?

12:01.808 --> 12:05.712
Know me? She's my mom!

12:07.379 --> 12:10.950
Claudius! Maybe we should
postpone our departure

12:10.983 --> 12:13.820
until your "family matters"
are resolved?

12:13.853 --> 12:16.756
My family matters are just fine.

12:16.789 --> 12:23.696
Richard, your mother... I mean,
Aurora should have told you long ago.

12:23.730 --> 12:25.397
Told me what?

12:25.431 --> 12:29.201
You are a sparrow, Richard.

12:29.235 --> 12:32.772
You cannot migrate.

12:32.805 --> 12:35.842
You belong here,
with the other sparrows.

12:42.782 --> 12:44.751
You almost had me there, Dad!

12:44.784 --> 12:47.319
You always did have such a...
Sense of humor.

12:47.353 --> 12:52.424
Haha. Hmm. Oh?

12:52.458 --> 12:55.061
Poor little thing.

12:59.799 --> 13:01.233
Come with me.

13:01.267 --> 13:03.335
I have something to show you.

13:03.369 --> 13:05.738
Hmm. Mom?

13:07.406 --> 13:08.875
Mom! What do you mean?

13:08.908 --> 13:10.877
- Wait!
- Richard!

13:10.910 --> 13:12.378
You stay here, Max.

13:12.411 --> 13:15.114
- But Dad? I...
- Stay!

13:15.147 --> 13:16.348
Our meeting is over.

13:16.382 --> 13:19.852
We shall depart at the break of dawn.

13:37.937 --> 13:40.072
Where are we?

13:40.106 --> 13:44.877
I found you here,
in this sparrow's nest.

13:44.911 --> 13:49.448
Your parents were... taken...
before you hatched.

13:49.481 --> 13:50.616
No!

13:50.649 --> 13:53.085
You're my Mom. And I'm coming with you.

13:53.119 --> 13:55.454
Richard, you can't go to Africa.

13:55.487 --> 13:58.124
I can, Mom!

13:58.157 --> 14:00.960
- It's Dad, isn't it?
- Richard, listen, we...

14:00.993 --> 14:03.996
Maybe my legs are short,
and my beak is tiny.

14:04.030 --> 14:06.332
But that's because I'm a small stork!

14:06.365 --> 14:08.901
But I'm gonna grow up to be a big stork!

14:08.935 --> 14:11.170
Big and strong! He'll see!

14:11.203 --> 14:13.339
- Wait!
- You'll all see!

14:16.843 --> 14:19.812
I can feel it, I can make it to Africa!

14:19.846 --> 14:20.713
Hmm.

14:20.747 --> 14:24.016
How hard can it be? It's not like
crossing an ocean or anything.

14:24.050 --> 14:26.018
Hurry up, you lame ducks!

14:26.052 --> 14:27.954
The Great Lake awaits!

14:27.987 --> 14:30.522
I'll show 'em how it's done!

14:30.556 --> 14:32.491
Speedy stork, coming through!

14:34.994 --> 14:35.961
Look at that little fella!

14:35.962 --> 14:38.597
With his speed, we'd be
in Africa in no time.

14:38.630 --> 14:41.033
My thoughts exactly!

14:41.067 --> 14:45.537
Ha ha! I'll just swing by to pick up
the family, then next stop, Africa!

14:45.571 --> 14:47.874
Argh!

14:47.907 --> 14:51.277
- Give him a chance, Dad!
- Do not provoke me, son.

14:51.310 --> 14:54.046
Storks could never survive the winter

14:54.080 --> 14:56.983
and sparrows could never
survive the migration.

14:57.016 --> 14:59.385
Never! That's just fact.

14:59.418 --> 15:01.553
But he can fly way better than I can!

15:01.587 --> 15:04.023
Did I not make myself clear?

15:04.056 --> 15:07.860
Sparrows are not made for
high altitudes. You know this!

15:07.894 --> 15:10.930
Richard would never
make it there alive, son.

15:10.963 --> 15:12.464
Is that what you want?

15:12.498 --> 15:16.535
I... I... Hm.

15:18.370 --> 15:22.008
- Hey, everybody! I'm home!
- Richard!

15:22.041 --> 15:24.911
- Are you all right?
- All right?

15:24.944 --> 15:28.047
Never been better!
I could fly around the world!

15:28.080 --> 15:30.649
Enough of this! Time to nest.

15:30.682 --> 15:32.351
We have a long first leg ahead of us.

15:32.384 --> 15:35.587
I can't wait!

15:35.621 --> 15:37.890
Whooo.

15:37.924 --> 15:39.425
I knew this would happen.

15:44.630 --> 15:47.099
Hey, why are you so gloomy?
We're going to Africa!

15:47.133 --> 15:49.335
Um, I guess I'm just tired.

15:49.368 --> 15:54.440
- We better crash.
- Good call.

15:54.473 --> 15:57.043
Gotta be prepped for takeoff!

15:57.076 --> 15:59.378
Am I right, big guy?

15:59.411 --> 16:00.947
Good night, beanpole.

16:02.949 --> 16:05.384
Sleep tight, little brother.

16:09.588 --> 16:11.657
Mm?

16:27.106 --> 16:31.210
Africa... Oooh.

16:31.243 --> 16:34.113
Hm.

16:34.146 --> 16:36.949
Be safe, Richard.

16:43.022 --> 16:44.991
We're running out of time.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.435
I can't believe we're doing this.

16:56.468 --> 16:58.270
It's for the best, Max.

17:18.023 --> 17:20.291
Huh? Good morning!

17:20.326 --> 17:23.061
Ready, willing and able to migrate!

17:23.095 --> 17:25.330
Let's get a move on...

17:29.035 --> 17:31.603
Mom? Dad?

17:34.206 --> 17:36.508
Max?

17:39.311 --> 17:42.048
Is that...? No!

17:42.081 --> 17:45.451
Wait! You forgot me!

17:45.484 --> 17:48.387
Wait! Wait for me!

17:51.690 --> 17:53.425
No!

17:58.264 --> 17:59.498
Come on!

18:22.388 --> 18:25.224
He looks dead.

18:25.257 --> 18:26.592
Poke him.

18:26.625 --> 18:29.661
What's that?

18:29.695 --> 18:32.164
Fine. I'll poke him.

18:32.198 --> 18:35.834
Hey, if you're not going to poke,
don't tell me how to poke.

18:35.867 --> 18:38.204
I do so know how to poke!

18:38.237 --> 18:40.339
See? Whoops.

18:40.372 --> 18:44.643
Ow.

18:45.744 --> 18:47.613
- Hmm...
- Huh?

18:47.646 --> 18:51.117
- Oooo hoo.
- Ah!

18:51.150 --> 18:55.154
Mmm?

18:55.187 --> 18:58.857
Who... who are you?

18:58.890 --> 19:03.095
I'm Olga, and this is
my best friend, Oleg.

19:05.264 --> 19:07.599
We're pygmy owls!

19:07.633 --> 19:11.237
Right... Oleg...

19:11.270 --> 19:14.806
- Um, am I in Africa?
- Mm? Mm!

19:23.482 --> 19:24.883
Want a bite?

19:24.916 --> 19:30.222
- Eww.
- More for us.

19:30.256 --> 19:33.292
Hey! Why would you think this is Africa?

19:33.325 --> 19:37.163
Oh. That's where I'm migrating
to with the other storks.

19:37.196 --> 19:40.232
At least I thought I was?

19:40.266 --> 19:42.501
Yeah, I heard him, Oleg.

19:44.670 --> 19:50.642
Eh... You do realize you are not
even close to being a stork, right?

19:50.676 --> 19:53.245
Ha! Shows what you know.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.447
My dad's leader of the flock.

19:57.616 --> 20:00.219
Sounds like Daddy issues to me.

20:01.687 --> 20:03.622
Oh, yeah, Oleg?

20:03.655 --> 20:06.158
So, why isn't he
with his flock then? Hm?

20:06.192 --> 20:10.229
Dad never believed in me.
Said I'd never make it.

20:10.262 --> 20:12.198
Oh! I see!

20:12.231 --> 20:16.268
Well, when you're not wanted,
you're better off on your own.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.704
- Right, Oleg?
- Wrong!

20:18.737 --> 20:22.208
I belong with my flock!
I'll catch up with them.

20:22.241 --> 20:25.611
And when I get there, my Dad
will see that I am a stork!

20:27.713 --> 20:29.215
You're very weird.

20:29.248 --> 20:31.883
I? I am weird?

20:31.917 --> 20:33.819
O-kay.

20:33.852 --> 20:37.389
Have fun with your...
"friend" or whatever.

20:37.423 --> 20:39.191
I'll go find my family.

20:40.226 --> 20:43.662
Hold your horses!

20:43.695 --> 20:46.298
South is that way!

20:46.332 --> 20:50.202
Pfft! Thanks, but we storks
know how to navigate.

20:50.236 --> 20:53.305
Fine! Go, stork boy!

20:53.339 --> 20:57.843
Ever seen a crazy bird like that?

20:57.876 --> 21:00.312
What do you mean, we're alike?

21:00.346 --> 21:04.383
"Not a stork"? I'll show her!

21:04.416 --> 21:05.751
Okay...

21:05.784 --> 21:08.954
They went south, and south is this way!

21:12.558 --> 21:13.559
No.

21:14.793 --> 21:16.595
No, south is that way.

21:19.398 --> 21:22.268
Uh... Or maybe this?

21:26.605 --> 21:28.807
Mom? Dad?!

21:30.542 --> 21:32.244
Hi, there.

21:32.278 --> 21:35.681
Oh!

21:35.714 --> 21:38.584
This is bad. This is really bad!

21:38.617 --> 21:40.852
Out of the way!

21:40.886 --> 21:42.254
Oh!

21:42.288 --> 21:44.756
- What are those things?
- Hungry!

21:44.790 --> 21:46.892
Follow us if you want to live!

21:53.665 --> 21:55.601
I'm right behind you.

21:55.634 --> 21:57.303
- I'm gonna catch you.
- Wait for us!

21:59.070 --> 22:02.040
Olga! Ah!

22:02.073 --> 22:04.443
Oh!

22:04.476 --> 22:05.777
Get down!

22:13.985 --> 22:16.355
I see you!

22:17.323 --> 22:18.824
Wait! I got...

22:18.857 --> 22:21.927
Oh, no, you don't!

22:21.960 --> 22:24.363
Surprise!

22:26.432 --> 22:28.367
Whoa!

22:29.768 --> 22:32.438
That won't shake them off for long.

22:32.471 --> 22:35.474
Get up, you two! He's getting away!

22:37.976 --> 22:39.345
- What now?!
- The light!

22:39.378 --> 22:41.447
We have to get closer to the light!

22:41.480 --> 22:42.748
- Got it!
- Wait!

22:44.049 --> 22:45.016
Yow!

22:45.050 --> 22:47.653
Not that close!

22:47.686 --> 22:49.688
They went over this way!

22:49.721 --> 22:50.922
Hey, bats!

22:50.956 --> 22:52.791
What are you doing?!

22:54.026 --> 22:55.961
- Hey! Let me go!
- You miss us?

22:55.994 --> 22:58.330
Looking for a tasty sparrow?

22:58.364 --> 22:59.765
- Yeah!
- Very yummy!

22:59.798 --> 23:01.600
Stork, you crazy owl!

23:02.834 --> 23:05.036
- Aah!
- Olga!

23:18.417 --> 23:22.388
Woo-hoo!

23:22.421 --> 23:25.791
Awesome!

23:25.824 --> 23:28.627
I mean... ahem.

23:28.660 --> 23:31.062
It's not like I needed any help.

23:31.096 --> 23:33.632
Mm-hmm. Right...

23:33.665 --> 23:36.702
See? This is what you get
for being nice.

23:36.735 --> 23:39.538
Big Bird here can take care of himself.

23:39.571 --> 23:42.007
Let's go chase some mice!

23:44.743 --> 23:47.746
Eh?

23:49.080 --> 23:52.851
Olga! Wait! Olga?

23:52.884 --> 23:55.554
Heh. You're still here?

23:55.587 --> 23:57.856
Oh, we thought you'd be
in Africa by now.

23:57.889 --> 23:59.991
Eh, I was thinking...

24:00.025 --> 24:04.763
Since we storks aren't nocturnal, and
you can see in the dark and all that...

24:04.796 --> 24:08.734
um, maybe you could, you know, guide me?

24:08.767 --> 24:10.168
Only until dawn, of course!

24:10.201 --> 24:14.072
Hmm. Do we look like
bird-sitters to you? No way!

24:16.642 --> 24:18.410
No, Oleg!

24:18.444 --> 24:21.680
And don't give me the evil eye!
Time to go home.

24:24.483 --> 24:27.453
Man, I hate your do-goodery!

24:27.486 --> 24:30.021
Ugh! We'll play nice.

24:30.055 --> 24:32.023
- Great, Olga!
- Thank Oleg.

24:32.057 --> 24:34.926
I'm doing this for him.
Come on, stork boy!

24:37.496 --> 24:39.465
I'm Richard, by the way.

24:58.684 --> 25:00.786
He hasn't spoken since we left.

25:00.819 --> 25:03.589
Max will grow from this.

25:03.622 --> 25:05.457
We did the right thing for Richard.

25:05.491 --> 25:08.494
I hope he's all right.

25:08.527 --> 25:10.496
Don't worry.

25:10.529 --> 25:13.499
I'm sure he's found
some sparrows by now.

25:30.716 --> 25:32.718
Huh?

25:34.052 --> 25:36.187
What?

25:38.557 --> 25:40.626
Where... where are we?

25:40.659 --> 25:43.529
What's going on?

25:43.562 --> 25:45.697
Oh, stop laughing!

25:45.731 --> 25:49.000
- Hey, Olga!
- I'm not fat!

25:49.034 --> 25:52.203
Hey, Olga! Wake up!

25:52.237 --> 25:55.507
Breathe!

25:55.541 --> 25:57.609
It's okay. Oh.

25:59.244 --> 26:01.513
- Eww!
- Nice one.

26:01.547 --> 26:04.115
- What's for breakfast?
- What was that?

26:04.149 --> 26:06.217
Never seen a pellet before?

26:06.251 --> 26:08.554
It's a little of this, little of that.

26:08.587 --> 26:09.788
You don't really wanna know.

26:11.222 --> 26:13.559
What are we doing on this thing?

26:13.592 --> 26:15.661
I belong in the air!

26:15.694 --> 26:17.162
Um, excuse me?

26:17.195 --> 26:19.297
Who had to fall asleep mid-flight?

26:19.330 --> 26:22.033
I... I... Hm.

26:22.067 --> 26:24.570
Exactly! Now chill.

26:24.603 --> 26:26.572
This thing took us further overnight

26:26.605 --> 26:28.173
than you could've ever flown.

26:28.206 --> 26:32.077
Oh, yeah? Then where's my family?

26:34.880 --> 26:36.582
If you really wanna know...

26:36.615 --> 26:39.050
What are you talking about?

26:39.084 --> 26:40.686
Just saying...

26:42.353 --> 26:44.656
They don't look anything like me.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.925
- Wow!
- Wow!

26:46.958 --> 26:50.829
- You're friends with an owl?
- Not friends!

26:50.862 --> 26:52.097
What?!

26:52.130 --> 26:56.067
Hi! I've never seen you before.

26:56.101 --> 26:58.570
A bunch of tourists just dumped
these tasty travel snacks.

26:58.604 --> 27:00.606
You guys hungry?

27:02.373 --> 27:05.677
I don't eat trash. I hunt and fish.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.113
- Oh...
- Suit yourself!

27:10.916 --> 27:13.585
- What brings you to France?
- Get this!

27:13.619 --> 27:16.187
He's going south, chasing his flock!

27:16.221 --> 27:19.090
But... we don't migrate.

27:19.124 --> 27:21.727
What kind of sparrow are you?

27:21.760 --> 27:24.730
I... I... I am a stork!

27:26.064 --> 27:29.067
- Wow. Huh?
- Hmm!

27:29.100 --> 27:30.602
Don't take it personal.

27:30.636 --> 27:33.204
He's a late bloomer.

27:33.238 --> 27:34.906
Oh...

27:37.909 --> 27:41.780
Poor things! Just wanted to say hi.

27:41.813 --> 27:45.651
No, thanks. Yeesh, so pushy!

27:45.684 --> 27:49.120
They're sparrows!
Pushy is their middle name.

27:49.154 --> 27:51.790
Can we get back to my family?

27:51.823 --> 27:54.325
Maybe we're close enough
to catch their scent by now.

27:54.359 --> 27:58.697
Talk about being pushy, right, Oleg?

27:58.730 --> 28:00.932
- Wait! You found them?
- Ooh!

28:00.966 --> 28:02.768
Go, Olga, go!

28:06.171 --> 28:08.006
Wait, this can't be right!

28:13.745 --> 28:16.014
Ah... what?

28:16.047 --> 28:19.150
Mein Hawk-Burger just flew away.

28:19.184 --> 28:22.688
What are you doing?

28:22.721 --> 28:24.856
Great, just great, Olga.

28:24.890 --> 28:26.692
My family could be
right around the corner

28:26.725 --> 28:29.695
and you're busy stuffing your beak!

28:29.728 --> 28:33.699
First things first, Oleg.
This stuff's magical!

28:40.138 --> 28:41.707
- Comment!
- Like!

28:41.740 --> 28:43.208
Huh?

28:43.241 --> 28:45.443
Fine, stay here.

28:45.476 --> 28:48.046
But, Oleg, all this delicious stuff!

28:50.315 --> 28:52.751
All right, all right!

28:55.220 --> 28:57.689
Hey, guys? Hey! Listen, you...

28:57.723 --> 28:59.691
- Aah!
- Have! You! Seen!

28:59.725 --> 29:00.892
A! Flock! Of! Storks!

29:00.926 --> 29:03.829
Aaah! Ouch!

29:03.862 --> 29:05.030
What was that?

29:05.063 --> 29:08.133
A sparrow just tried to hack me!

29:08.166 --> 29:10.035
Fail! What a troll.

29:10.068 --> 29:11.737
I'm a stork, got that?

29:11.770 --> 29:14.873
Not according to the Chick-a-pedia.

29:14.906 --> 29:17.242
- Ha ha ha. LOL!
- Like!

29:17.275 --> 29:21.012
- Hello? Someone there?!
- So, what's up?

29:21.046 --> 29:22.748
They must have fried their bird brains.

29:22.781 --> 29:24.249
Like!

29:24.282 --> 29:25.917
I'm wasting my time.

29:25.951 --> 29:28.720
Hmmm, I think I see how this works.

29:28.754 --> 29:31.156
- Love! Unfriend!
- Loading!

29:31.189 --> 29:33.859
Oh, what could possibly go wrong, Oleg?

29:33.892 --> 29:35.894
All you gotta do...

29:35.927 --> 29:37.028
Olga?!

29:37.062 --> 29:40.031
Suddenly I feel so...

29:40.065 --> 29:43.434
Connected!

29:43.468 --> 29:46.838
- Huh?
- OMG, an online owl.

29:46.872 --> 29:50.742
Olga! Can I friend you?

29:50.776 --> 29:52.109
- Me too! Me too!
- Me too! Me too!

29:52.110 --> 29:55.346
Uh... Sure! Wow!

29:55.380 --> 29:57.282
Six new friend requests already!

29:57.315 --> 30:00.752
- This is fun, Oleg!
- Ask them, Olga!

30:00.786 --> 30:02.220
Oh, oh, oh, right!

30:02.253 --> 30:05.223
Seen a flock of storks around?

30:05.256 --> 30:08.426
Storks? Non. Maybe someone else has.

30:08.459 --> 30:12.931
I'll check Facebeak.

30:12.964 --> 30:13.899
Aha!

30:13.932 --> 30:16.067
A friend of a friend
of a cousin's friend,

30:16.101 --> 30:18.536
- who I've actually blocked...
- Stalker!

30:18.569 --> 30:22.540
Says he spotted the storks
on their way to Gibraltar.

30:22.573 --> 30:25.076
Gibraltar! How do I get there?

30:25.110 --> 30:27.545
Shortest route or fewest wind farms?

30:27.578 --> 30:29.781
Never mind.

30:29.815 --> 30:32.117
I'll send Olga the coordinates...

30:33.151 --> 30:34.485
Ah!

30:34.519 --> 30:37.823
- Recalculating...
- Great! Let's go!

30:37.856 --> 30:39.390
Huh? Huh?

30:39.424 --> 30:43.061
- Olga?
- Ahh!

30:43.094 --> 30:44.562
He'll have to wait.

30:44.595 --> 30:47.465
I'm busy completing my profile!

30:47.498 --> 30:49.234
Come on, Olga!

30:49.267 --> 30:51.002
Lead the way!

30:54.172 --> 30:58.076
Just as I was getting to know her.

30:58.109 --> 31:00.078
I guess I'm back on the market.

31:00.111 --> 31:02.948
Like!

31:12.357 --> 31:16.427
Polly want a stale cracker?

31:16.461 --> 31:19.264
Because that's all you get
till you bring me customers!

31:19.297 --> 31:23.835
Sing, Kiki! Sing as if
your life depended on it!

31:23.869 --> 31:25.971
Which it does!

31:32.043 --> 31:35.981
♪ Oh, big ol' truck ♪

31:36.014 --> 31:38.283
♪ I love you best... ♪

31:38.316 --> 31:40.018
Little green waste of space!

31:49.360 --> 31:52.030
♪ I'm coming out ♪

31:52.063 --> 31:54.332
♪ I want the world to know ♪

31:54.365 --> 31:58.003

31:58.036 --> 31:59.905
♪ There's a new me coming out... ♪

32:03.041 --> 32:05.310
Oh...

32:05.343 --> 32:09.014
- ♪ Oh, big ol' truck ♪
- Cheap electronics.

32:09.047 --> 32:12.917
- ♪ I love you best... ♪
- If you don't shape up, I'm getting a cat!

32:14.986 --> 32:16.554
Mon Dieu!

32:16.587 --> 32:19.024
The Sanremo Festival begins tomorrow!

32:19.057 --> 32:22.093
<i>Attention! The express train
to Sanremo is arriving.</i>

32:22.127 --> 32:24.896
<i>It leaves immediately
after my coffee break.</i>

32:24.930 --> 32:26.564
Wait for me!

32:26.597 --> 32:28.934
I gotta get out of this prison!

32:28.967 --> 32:31.669
Help me, cracker, you're my only hope.

32:34.305 --> 32:38.209
Oh, no! I'm doomed!

32:38.243 --> 32:40.045
- OMG!
- Huh?

32:40.078 --> 32:43.114
Making friends is so much
easier than I thought!

32:43.148 --> 32:45.516
So, which way to Gibraltar?

32:45.550 --> 32:49.921
- Admit it! We're lost!
- It's not that.

32:49.955 --> 32:54.059
I have to show you.

32:54.092 --> 32:56.361
Thanks to Pigeon Maps,

32:56.394 --> 33:01.699
I got a bird's eye view on everything,
only from way up.

33:01.732 --> 33:06.004
We found you... here.
And... this...

33:06.037 --> 33:08.439
- is where you're headed.
- Africa!

33:08.473 --> 33:14.079
Totally. Thanks to Oleg and me,
we are this far already.

33:14.112 --> 33:15.947
But your storks, man?

33:15.981 --> 33:18.716
They're approaching Gibraltar over here!

33:18.749 --> 33:21.452
- That's a mighty long haul!
- So?

33:21.486 --> 33:24.589
Don't you see?
It would take us a week to get there.

33:24.622 --> 33:27.959
That's impossible!
You must've taken us the wrong way.

33:27.993 --> 33:31.462
Whoa! There's nothing
wrong with our senses.

33:31.496 --> 33:33.498
We're just not as fast as storks.

33:33.531 --> 33:36.101
And you know why?

33:36.134 --> 33:39.604
- Because we're not storks.
- That's the problem.

33:39.637 --> 33:42.173
You're not storks!
You're slowing me down.

33:42.207 --> 33:47.012
This kid is driving me bananas.

33:47.045 --> 33:50.048
There just has to be
a faster way to Gibraltar!

33:50.081 --> 33:54.752
That's my cue.

33:54.785 --> 33:57.688
Madame, monsieur?

33:57.722 --> 33:59.490
May I be of assistance?

33:59.524 --> 34:03.261
- Hmm?
- Aww! Look at you!

34:03.294 --> 34:08.166
The predator and its prey.
Need to get to Gibraltar?

34:08.199 --> 34:10.435
My name's Richard and this is Olga.

34:10.467 --> 34:16.007
- And? Ahem.
- Fine! Olga and Oleg.

34:16.041 --> 34:19.177
Quoi? Oh, I get it!

34:19.210 --> 34:22.147
- The owl's gone cuckoo.
- Cuckoo? Us?

34:22.179 --> 34:25.382
Richard's the one
who thinks he's a stork!

34:25.416 --> 34:28.786
Oh! Mmm...

34:28.819 --> 34:31.022
Of course he's a stork!

34:31.056 --> 34:34.792
The upright posture,
the inimitable elegance...

34:34.824 --> 34:37.161
- Muah!
- Finally!

34:37.195 --> 34:39.097
Someone who knows
what he's talking about.

34:40.831 --> 34:42.533
And just who are you?

34:42.567 --> 34:48.373
My apologies, Kiki La Spree,
disco parakeet fantastique!

34:48.406 --> 34:50.808
Ambassador to Sparkleville!

34:50.841 --> 34:52.643
Distinguished professor of...

34:52.677 --> 34:53.811
- Blabberbeak?
- Oh!

34:53.844 --> 34:56.746
I couldn't help but overhear
your little picking match.

34:56.781 --> 35:00.085
But don't despair.
I can get you to Gibraltar!

35:00.118 --> 35:04.755
I was headed there myself.
Isn't that an amazing coincidence?

35:04.789 --> 35:07.492
What does a cage bird want in Gibraltar?

35:07.525 --> 35:10.228
Why, I'm performing there!

35:10.261 --> 35:12.063
To welcome the migrating birds!

35:12.097 --> 35:15.200
At the... uh... Gibraltar Festival!

35:15.233 --> 35:17.768
Free me and we'll catch
a train out of here

35:17.802 --> 35:21.139
faster than you can say "Disco Duck"!

35:21.172 --> 35:22.840
But what's a... train?

35:24.642 --> 35:28.113
What the what? Ho ho!

35:28.146 --> 35:30.348
- Voilà.
- Whoa!

35:30.381 --> 35:33.251
<i>I'm halfway through my café Au lait,
so prepare to board.</i>

35:33.284 --> 35:35.620
- Oh, no! We have to hurry!
- What?

35:35.653 --> 35:39.424
He said the train to Gibraltar
is leaving tout de suite!

35:39.457 --> 35:41.126
You speak human?

35:41.159 --> 35:46.464
After a zillion hours of karaoke,
even you would, my frizzy feather ball.

35:46.497 --> 35:48.099
Makes us wonder

35:48.133 --> 35:50.235
what other tricks you've got
under your plumage.

35:50.268 --> 35:53.104
Come on, Olga!
Kiki needs our help!

35:53.138 --> 35:54.205
Merci.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.774
Now there's a lock underneath,
but be careful.

35:59.277 --> 36:02.147
- I said be careful!
- What's wrong?

36:02.180 --> 36:04.149
I am afraid of heights, all right?

36:04.182 --> 36:05.583
Help!

36:07.418 --> 36:10.255
- Oy!
- Am I dead?

36:10.288 --> 36:11.622
Not yet.

36:11.656 --> 36:14.259
I don't hear you singing!

36:14.292 --> 36:16.227
- What the...
- Olga! Get him out of here!

36:17.362 --> 36:20.731
I'm not getting my wings dirty!
You let him out!

36:20.765 --> 36:24.769
Out of my way! I've got you now!

36:27.372 --> 36:28.506
No!

36:30.175 --> 36:35.146
- Where are you taking me?
- Just keep quiet, can you?

36:35.180 --> 36:37.748
What kind of bird is afraid of flying?

36:37.782 --> 36:41.752
Flying is for the riff-raff.
I'm a songbird!

36:43.354 --> 36:46.291
Let go of me, you heartless harpy!

36:46.324 --> 36:47.825
Oh, okay.

36:47.858 --> 36:50.295
Just great!

36:50.328 --> 36:51.662
Hey, he asked me!

36:51.696 --> 36:54.332
Kiki! Just fly! You're a bird!

36:54.365 --> 36:57.302
- I can't! Aaaahh!
- Spread your wings!

36:57.335 --> 37:00.471
- Now taking my final sip...
- The train's leaving.

37:00.505 --> 37:03.341
- It's all over now.
- No!

37:03.374 --> 37:06.777
Just let me drop to my deaaaathhh...

37:06.811 --> 37:10.248
Make it stop!
Make it stop!

37:10.281 --> 37:12.283
Oh!

37:12.317 --> 37:14.452
Oh! Tulips!

37:18.356 --> 37:21.259
Great! Now I'm gonna get bird flu!

37:21.292 --> 37:23.728
- Huh?
- Help me!

37:23.761 --> 37:25.330
Birds!

37:30.401 --> 37:31.101
Oh, no!

37:31.135 --> 37:33.571
What?!

37:33.604 --> 37:35.906
That's our train over there!

37:35.940 --> 37:38.343
<i>All aboard for Sanremo!</i>

37:38.376 --> 37:41.579
Gibraltar, here we come!

38:08.339 --> 38:10.741
Dad! We can't keep going!

38:10.775 --> 38:13.244
- Everyone needs a break!
- No!

38:13.278 --> 38:14.779
We stick to the prescribed route!

38:14.812 --> 38:18.416
Can't we at least fly a little lower?

38:18.449 --> 38:21.386
No. Now keep the formation!

38:21.419 --> 38:24.789
Stay together, everyone!
Don't fall behind!

38:24.822 --> 38:27.458
- But Dad!
- Max! Do as I say!

38:46.477 --> 38:47.745
And when I woke up,

38:47.778 --> 38:50.348
my brother and my parents were...

38:50.381 --> 38:52.783
gone.

38:52.817 --> 38:55.920
I wish I had a dramatic
backstory like that.

38:55.953 --> 39:00.325
I always dreamed of escaping
my dreary surroundings

39:00.358 --> 39:03.428
to become a famous disco star!

39:03.461 --> 39:06.964
Loved... adored...

39:06.997 --> 39:09.367
♪ I'm coming out ♪

39:09.400 --> 39:11.636
♪ I want the world to know ♪

39:11.669 --> 39:13.738
♪ Got to let... Oh! ♪

39:13.771 --> 39:16.507
What is "disco," anyway?

39:16.541 --> 39:21.312
Some kind of courtship behavior
to attract a mate?

39:21.346 --> 39:22.513
Can be.

39:22.547 --> 39:25.916
Although I doubt you could
ever pull it off, darling.

39:25.950 --> 39:29.620
- Hmm!
- Hey!

39:29.654 --> 39:33.624
I'm used to it. I know
that I'm big and awkward.

39:35.493 --> 39:38.663
Well... didn't your mama
ever teach you to groom?

39:38.696 --> 39:41.366
Mmm...

39:41.399 --> 39:45.470
Let's just say my family
didn't exactly embrace me.

39:45.503 --> 39:48.439
Maybe with a smooth-out
and some feather-gel...

39:48.473 --> 39:50.341
Don't you see that I'm freakishly big?

39:50.375 --> 39:53.711
I've seen way bigger owls
on the Forest Channel.

39:53.744 --> 39:56.414
Yeah, but not pygmy owls.

39:56.447 --> 40:00.518
- Guess... uh... not...
- I just never fit in.

40:00.551 --> 40:03.554
- Sounds familiar.
- No!

40:08.158 --> 40:10.561
No, I literally didn't fit in.

40:10.595 --> 40:13.998
I mean, in the nest...

40:17.001 --> 40:20.805
Pygmy owls are supposed
to be tiny, not giant.

40:20.838 --> 40:22.272
A "giant pygmy"?

40:22.306 --> 40:24.909
- Is that like a "jumbo shrimp"?
- Shh!

40:30.781 --> 40:32.049
Ah!

40:39.857 --> 40:43.160
♪ Olga is a monster! Olga is a freak! ♪

40:52.870 --> 40:55.240
Oh... ohhh!

40:55.273 --> 40:58.809
My own family didn't give
a hoot about me.

41:07.051 --> 41:11.088
I didn't have a single friend
in the whole world.

41:13.524 --> 41:15.560
Mm? Mm?

41:15.593 --> 41:20.798
And then... I met Oleg.

41:21.999 --> 41:23.734
Ah!

41:32.610 --> 41:35.513
You've always been there for me.

41:35.546 --> 41:39.584
Awww... Ditto.

41:39.617 --> 41:41.986
Ahem. How can I put this?

41:42.019 --> 41:45.089
Some folks think, for someone to exist,

41:45.122 --> 41:46.924
you have to see them.

41:46.957 --> 41:49.994
It sounds kind of crazy, I know.

41:50.027 --> 41:51.562
Just leave us alone!

41:53.631 --> 41:55.500
- Nice.
- What?

41:59.136 --> 42:03.107
It's okay, Olga. I know how you feel.

42:05.142 --> 42:07.512
<i>Passengers, we will now dim the lights</i>

42:07.545 --> 42:09.747
<i>and wish you all a good night.</i>

42:09.780 --> 42:11.982
<i>We'll be in Sanremo in the morning.</i>

42:12.016 --> 42:13.584
Hmm?

42:13.618 --> 42:15.820
Uh, uh... He said...

42:15.853 --> 42:20.024
Uh, the breakfast buffet
has an omelet station

42:20.057 --> 42:22.026
and the toilet is backed up.

42:22.059 --> 42:25.630
Time for our beauty sleep!

42:25.663 --> 42:27.632
Good night!

42:31.235 --> 42:36.006
Here, hold on to me... if you want to.

42:43.247 --> 42:47.518
- Almost there.
- Uhh... Yeah.

42:47.552 --> 42:49.720
Good night, sweethearts.

43:16.581 --> 43:18.616
Don't feel guilty. Just go.

43:18.649 --> 43:23.020
Oh, I'm faker than a pair
of faux-leather stilettos.

43:23.053 --> 43:27.625
Oh, well, a diva has to do
what a diva has to do!

43:27.658 --> 43:28.658
Oh!

43:30.628 --> 43:33.731
What has she got in this thing, a piano?

43:33.764 --> 43:36.033
Oh...

43:36.066 --> 43:37.101
Kiki, we have to...

43:37.134 --> 43:38.569
- Kiki?
- Huh?!

43:38.603 --> 43:39.870
Birds!

43:39.904 --> 43:42.339
Shoo! Shoo, birds!

43:42.372 --> 43:44.742
Kiki?

43:44.775 --> 43:46.577
Kiki!

43:48.646 --> 43:50.214
Where are you?

43:50.247 --> 43:55.185
Forget him!
Let's just get outta... Here.

44:01.225 --> 44:03.728
- Well, if you saw the window, Oleg...
- Look out!

44:03.761 --> 44:05.362
Then why didn't you say something?

44:05.395 --> 44:07.798
- Oh!
- Wow. Owl coming through!

44:07.832 --> 44:09.734
Ooh!

44:09.767 --> 44:12.670
Oh! Oh, oh!

44:16.273 --> 44:19.677
Looks like you're not-a from here.

44:19.710 --> 44:22.880
Looks like-a you could use-a
some help from a local,

44:22.913 --> 44:26.984
like... Don Crowleone, sí?

44:27.017 --> 44:28.653
Well, I... eh...

44:28.686 --> 44:32.890
Hehe, I see you and it-a hit me
like a lasagna to the face!

44:32.923 --> 44:35.225
There's so many dangers
in this-a town...

44:35.259 --> 44:38.095
You gonna need-a someone
to a-look out for you, eh?

44:38.128 --> 44:39.697
Or you might run inta...

44:40.798 --> 44:43.300
Some very bad birds.

44:43.333 --> 44:45.169
- Hmm?
- So look.

44:45.202 --> 44:48.939
We protect you...
for a small-a fee, of course...

44:48.973 --> 44:52.777
so you can enjoy-a your stay in Sanremo.

44:52.810 --> 44:56.714
Huh? Sanremo? You mean Gibraltar.

44:56.747 --> 44:59.684
Scusi, Gibraltar?

45:01.218 --> 45:03.053
The bambino thinks he's in Gibraltar!
Ha ha!

45:04.889 --> 45:06.991
You're in beautiful Sanremo!

45:07.024 --> 45:08.826
- In Italia!
- W-what?

45:08.859 --> 45:12.262
Why you think-a we got-a
these-a wacky accents, ah?

45:12.296 --> 45:16.000
- Then where's Africa?
- Africa? Ha!

45:16.033 --> 45:19.804
- Way-a far away, over the sea.
- No!

45:19.837 --> 45:21.005
Don't try-a flyin' there,

45:21.038 --> 45:23.808
or you be swimmin' with the fishes.

45:24.942 --> 45:27.277
I knew that glittery green
schemer was up to no good!

45:27.311 --> 45:29.279
You mean-a the parakeet?

45:29.313 --> 45:31.281
I see him in-a big hurry.

45:31.315 --> 45:34.151
He asked-a how to get
to the Sanremo Festival.

45:34.184 --> 45:35.452
Weird little bird.

45:35.485 --> 45:37.855
Whaaaaat?! He used us!

45:37.888 --> 45:41.692
Sounds like you've been-a
had big-a-time, bambini.

45:41.726 --> 45:44.461
Hey!

45:44.494 --> 45:45.863
Richard!

45:45.896 --> 45:48.833
Shush!

45:50.935 --> 45:53.237
Wait... where are you going?

45:53.270 --> 45:55.840
How could Kiki do this?

45:55.873 --> 45:58.008
How am I going to reach my family now?

45:58.042 --> 46:00.745
No, Oleg! Hold your beak.

46:00.778 --> 46:02.747
It's time I straightened him out.

46:04.448 --> 46:07.484
You know what, Richard?
Maybe this will teach you.

46:07.517 --> 46:11.756
You're only in this mess 'cause you
won't accept what you really are.

46:11.789 --> 46:14.491
I really am totally sick
of arguing this!

46:14.524 --> 46:17.427
Fine! So then stop! Oleg, tell him!

46:17.461 --> 46:20.197
As if Oleg really existed!

46:20.230 --> 46:22.199
Leave him out of this, sparrow!

46:22.232 --> 46:25.235
Oleg's just in your head! Got it?!

46:25.269 --> 46:28.505
He's. Not. Real!

46:28.538 --> 46:30.340
La-la-la-la-la-la!
Aaah!

46:32.276 --> 46:35.079
Just great.

46:35.112 --> 46:36.881
My father had it right!

46:36.914 --> 46:39.817
Storks need to stay with their own kind.

46:39.850 --> 46:43.187
I never should've followed you. Gah!

46:43.220 --> 46:46.223
Fine! Go! Leave me!

46:46.256 --> 46:50.427
I don't need you! I don't need anyone!

46:50.460 --> 46:52.529
Oh, rats!

46:52.562 --> 46:56.200
No. I will not follow him!

46:56.233 --> 46:58.803
Ruffle your feathers
as much as you like.

46:58.836 --> 47:00.905
Whose side are you on?

47:00.938 --> 47:02.873
No, you listen, Mr. Do-gooder!

47:02.907 --> 47:05.542
Whose fault is it
that I'm in this mess, huh?

47:05.575 --> 47:09.046
You're nothing but trouble, Oleg.

47:09.079 --> 47:10.781
I wish we never met!

47:14.484 --> 47:17.822
Hm? Hm?

47:17.855 --> 47:20.257
Where did you go?

47:20.290 --> 47:22.226
Oleg?

47:25.863 --> 47:28.165
Oleg!

47:28.198 --> 47:31.836
Here! We love you!

47:31.869 --> 47:33.871
What's that fragrance?

47:33.904 --> 47:37.441
Why, it's the sweet smell
of superstardom!

47:37.474 --> 47:40.144
First prize, here I come! Huh?

47:40.177 --> 47:42.412
Who put this man-shaped mountain here?

47:42.446 --> 47:43.747
<i>Attenzione!</i>

47:43.780 --> 47:47.317
<i>All songbirds to the roof
for the Sanremo festival!</i>

47:47.351 --> 47:48.853
Oh!

47:48.886 --> 47:52.156
Why do bird events always
have to be high up?

47:52.189 --> 47:54.825
One... wing in front of the... other.

47:56.060 --> 47:58.829
Registrazione!

47:58.863 --> 48:02.332
Registrazione for the
birdsong festival here-a!

48:02.366 --> 48:05.235
It is showtime!

48:07.237 --> 48:10.607
Somebody's got to know
the way to Africa around here.

48:10.640 --> 48:13.177
Storks!

48:15.645 --> 48:16.881
Hello?

48:20.217 --> 48:22.119
Hello?

48:25.022 --> 48:28.158
Anybody home?

48:31.561 --> 48:33.363
Anybody?

48:42.372 --> 48:45.575
They must be in Africa by now.

48:45.609 --> 48:47.077
Aw...

48:51.581 --> 48:52.917
Oleg!

48:55.085 --> 48:56.921
Where are you?

48:56.954 --> 48:58.956
I didn't mean it!

49:00.057 --> 49:01.959
Come back!

49:04.228 --> 49:05.662
Post!

49:05.695 --> 49:08.899
- Share!
- Posting!

49:08.933 --> 49:11.668
You guys gotta help me!

49:11.701 --> 49:12.769
I'm looking for Oleg!

49:12.802 --> 49:17.174
I lost him. I lost Richard.
I lost all my friends.

49:17.207 --> 49:21.846
Wait! Aren't you that weirdo
owl we heard about online?

49:21.879 --> 49:23.748
The one who was chasing a sparrow

49:23.781 --> 49:26.784
- who thought he was a stork?
- Yes! That's me!

49:26.817 --> 49:28.853
Uh... except for the "weirdo part".

49:28.886 --> 49:29.754
That's-a you?

49:29.787 --> 49:33.090
You're-a trending like-a mad! Plug in.

49:33.123 --> 49:35.893
Yeah. We got-a the hi-speed cable.

49:35.926 --> 49:37.728
Um, okay.

49:37.762 --> 49:39.063
But... only for a second.

49:39.096 --> 49:41.098
Hopefully somebody's seen my friends.

49:43.100 --> 49:47.204
High speed! Life in the fast lane!

49:47.237 --> 49:48.739
Told ya!

49:48.773 --> 49:51.008
Okay, now let's find Oleg.

49:52.109 --> 49:56.380
OMG! I got 3012 friend requests?!

49:57.647 --> 50:00.100
Would you mind confirming
my friend request first?

50:00.102 --> 50:00.919
Mmm?

50:00.951 --> 50:01.685
Yeah! Mine too!

50:01.718 --> 50:06.791
Sure! I'll confirm all of them!

50:06.824 --> 50:08.025
- So many...
- Like!

50:08.058 --> 50:09.894
- New friends!
- Post!

50:12.830 --> 50:15.465
Mmm. This is it!

50:15.499 --> 50:17.835
Your magic moment!

50:17.868 --> 50:21.939
<i>Welcome to the Sanremo Festival!</i>

50:21.972 --> 50:24.474
If only I had some friends
to cheer for me.

50:24.508 --> 50:29.146
<i>And-a now we open the show
with an all-time disco classic.</i>

50:29.179 --> 50:32.549
Oh, well, the show must go on.

50:32.582 --> 50:34.785
<i>It's the parakeet
with the tweet so sweet...</i>

50:34.819 --> 50:37.287
<i>The stunningly gorgeous...</i>

50:37.321 --> 50:39.824
<i>The breathtakingly beautiful...</i>

50:39.857 --> 50:42.059
- Koko!
- Oh! What?!

50:42.092 --> 50:44.261
No, no, no! My name is...

50:44.294 --> 50:47.397
- Performers only!
- That's what I am!

50:47.431 --> 50:48.933
Oh, oh, please, please...

50:48.966 --> 50:51.335
- Oh... no!
- Oh, my!

50:51.368 --> 50:54.939

<i>Attenzione, passengers!</i>

52:06.110 --> 52:11.348
<i>Ferry departs to Tunis, Africa, Pier 12.</i>

52:14.919 --> 52:18.488
Oh, ferry to Africa... pfft!

52:18.522 --> 52:22.159
This dreamboat's got
nothing left to twirl for.

52:22.192 --> 52:28.398
Au revoir, fame!
Bonjour, oblivion!

52:28.432 --> 52:31.068
Luigi! Everybody's at-a the cliffs!

52:31.101 --> 52:35.072
A sparrow wants to fly
across-a da sea to Africa!

52:35.105 --> 52:38.342
But-a that's-a crazy dangerous!

52:38.375 --> 52:40.911
Great! Let's-a go!

52:42.079 --> 52:44.949
Richard?

52:44.982 --> 52:48.085
Oh! I've got to stop him!

52:51.321 --> 52:55.225
Oh, I can't, I just can't!

52:55.259 --> 52:58.929
But Richard needs me! Ah! Eh!

52:58.963 --> 53:03.900
Here comes Kiki! Whoa! Whoa!

53:06.003 --> 53:10.074
Oh, no, no, no!
It'll be all right, Richard!

53:17.114 --> 53:19.950
Good job, little piggy!

53:21.118 --> 53:23.954
Olga?! Oh! Oh!

53:23.988 --> 53:28.092
For the love of Donna Summer,
what are you doing?

53:30.060 --> 53:32.496
I'm tilling my virtual farm.

53:32.529 --> 53:34.999
Leave her alone,
or I'll block-a your access!

53:35.032 --> 53:38.102
# PeskyParakeet!

53:38.135 --> 53:39.636
Oh... oh!

53:39.669 --> 53:41.972
Re-post!

53:46.210 --> 53:47.344
What have you done?

53:47.377 --> 53:49.479
Let's find another hotspot, quick!

53:49.513 --> 53:52.082
Dislike!

53:52.116 --> 53:53.650
- Richard needs our help!
- You!

53:53.683 --> 53:56.153
Why should I trust you?

53:56.186 --> 53:58.188
You tricked me once already,

53:58.222 --> 54:03.660
you deceitful, manipulative
superficial parakeet!

54:03.693 --> 54:06.263
Richard thinks he can fly
across the sea all by himself!

54:06.296 --> 54:08.698
But he'll never make it!

54:08.732 --> 54:11.068
We go to stop him!

54:11.101 --> 54:14.504
He left me, just like Oleg did.
Why should I care?

54:14.538 --> 54:17.041
Because you're friends!

54:17.074 --> 54:19.143
- Oh...
- Aw.

54:19.176 --> 54:22.012
Richard needs you. It's true.

54:22.046 --> 54:24.148
Ooh... ooh... ahh!

54:24.181 --> 54:27.151
I'll break your groove-thing

54:27.184 --> 54:29.019
if this is another one of your tricks!

54:29.053 --> 54:32.322
Eat me alive if you want! Just hurry!

54:32.356 --> 54:35.459
- Come on!
- I got you.

54:35.492 --> 54:37.027
Man, you're heavy for a parakeet.

54:37.061 --> 54:38.462
Said the giantess?

54:51.141 --> 54:52.442
Whoa!

54:52.476 --> 54:56.046
Hurry! That wacky sparrow's
a-gonna jump offa da cliff!

54:56.080 --> 54:59.583
With those-a winds?
He's-a cuckoo!

54:59.616 --> 55:01.818
I bet-a you three
herrings he goes-a splat.

55:01.851 --> 55:02.986
- Huh?
- You're on!

55:03.019 --> 55:06.490
- You can do it!
- Come on! Do it!

55:11.095 --> 55:12.562
- Jump!
- Come on!

55:12.596 --> 55:16.200
- Richard!
- Don't jump!

55:16.233 --> 55:19.203
We had a bet!

55:19.236 --> 55:20.737
Can't you see I'm busy here?

55:20.770 --> 55:22.672
No, Richard! It will kill you!

55:22.706 --> 55:25.442
- Yeah!
- Forgive me, please!

55:25.475 --> 55:28.212
I know I've been despicable.

55:28.245 --> 55:31.281
I beg you. Let me make it up to you!

55:31.315 --> 55:33.283
- Jump!
- Do it, do it, do it!

55:33.317 --> 55:36.853
I've lost Oleg already.
I can't lose you too!

55:36.886 --> 55:40.757
There's a safe way across to Africa.
A ferry!

55:40.790 --> 55:42.726
It's like a train that floats on water.

55:42.759 --> 55:45.195
No. I am a stork!

55:45.229 --> 55:47.097
Time I started acting like one.

55:52.269 --> 55:53.870
Richard!

55:59.143 --> 56:00.477
Just great.

56:00.510 --> 56:02.779
See you big boys over the rainbow!

56:03.947 --> 56:08.152
I bet-a you six herring
the green one chokes first.

56:11.455 --> 56:14.158
- Spread your wings!
- I can't! I can't!

56:16.326 --> 56:18.795
Heeeeere I cooooome!

56:30.540 --> 56:33.277
- There they go!
- Ho ho, yeah!

56:33.310 --> 56:38.282
- Pay up!
- Fine.

56:43.320 --> 56:45.255
Are we going down or up?

56:45.289 --> 56:48.225
We'll know if we crash and drown!

56:53.697 --> 56:56.333
Oh?

56:56.366 --> 56:57.834
Wow!

56:57.867 --> 57:00.204
This is amazing!

57:00.237 --> 57:03.340
Dazzle-tastic!

57:03.373 --> 57:06.810
This is definitely going in my memoirs.

57:06.843 --> 57:09.613
Too beautiful to stand!

57:09.646 --> 57:12.482
Right, Oleg? Oh.

57:12.516 --> 57:13.550
Mmm...

57:13.583 --> 57:17.187
Oh, wow...

57:17.221 --> 57:20.224
Oh...

57:20.257 --> 57:24.194
Africa, here we cooome!

57:38.408 --> 57:42.946
Look, a shooting star!
Everybody make a wish.

57:49.919 --> 57:54.358
That is no shooting star!

57:54.391 --> 57:56.693
And definitely not what I wished for!

58:01.565 --> 58:05.235
Darnit, not again.
There's something on the scope.

58:16.280 --> 58:19.283
Running on a plane
was not on my bucket list!

58:19.316 --> 58:22.018
Stay together!

58:24.421 --> 58:26.390
Olgaaaa!

58:33.930 --> 58:36.400
Where is Olga?

58:36.433 --> 58:37.934
Over there!

58:37.967 --> 58:42.639
- Olga!
- We'll save you, darling!

58:49.479 --> 58:51.047
Whoa!

58:51.080 --> 58:52.749
We have to find somewhere to land.

58:54.384 --> 58:56.920
In the middle of the sea?!

58:56.953 --> 58:58.488
There! What's that?

58:58.522 --> 59:00.624
An ocean liner!

59:06.330 --> 59:07.330
Whoo!

59:19.643 --> 59:23.480
I always wanted to learn
synchronized swimming.

59:23.513 --> 59:26.316
Olga!

59:26.350 --> 59:28.485
Darling!

59:28.518 --> 59:29.653
No!

59:37.427 --> 59:39.496
Oh!

59:39.529 --> 59:42.098
Olga! Come on! Get up!

59:42.131 --> 59:45.669
I know what to do!

59:47.371 --> 59:50.106
First aid poster.

59:50.139 --> 59:52.509
I stared at the thing for years.

59:52.542 --> 59:56.480
Come on. Olga, come on!

59:56.513 --> 59:59.749
Oh... oh...

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:08.525
It's... too late.

01:00:08.558 --> 01:00:10.394
No.

01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:19.803
Oleg?

01:00:19.836 --> 01:00:22.539
Please...

01:00:22.572 --> 01:00:23.873
Can you help her?

01:00:26.843 --> 01:00:29.879
It's all my fault, and I'm sorry.

01:00:31.681 --> 01:00:33.983
Please bring her back!

01:00:34.017 --> 01:00:36.453
She needs you more than ever, Oleg.

01:00:52.436 --> 01:00:54.838
Ah...

01:00:54.871 --> 01:00:56.540
- Oh...
- Huh?

01:00:56.573 --> 01:00:59.476
- Oleg? Is that you?
- Ha ha!

01:00:59.509 --> 01:01:02.412
- Yes!
- All right, yes! You're back!

01:01:04.614 --> 01:01:08.552
Whoa!

01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:11.888
Eww! Oh...

01:01:11.921 --> 01:01:15.859
This is the best gift I've ever gotten!

01:01:15.892 --> 01:01:18.928
Oh...

01:01:18.962 --> 01:01:21.498
Missed you, too, Oleg.

01:01:29.673 --> 01:01:35.211
This... is the life.

01:01:35.244 --> 01:01:38.482
"Indulge yourself in our luxury spa,

01:01:38.515 --> 01:01:41.618
with 'all-you-can-heat'
sauna privileges,

01:01:41.651 --> 01:01:44.120
as we near our destination of..."

01:01:44.153 --> 01:01:45.288
Hey!

01:01:45.321 --> 01:01:49.659
You'll never guess where
we're headed, tweethearts!

01:01:49.693 --> 01:01:51.160
Africa!

01:01:51.194 --> 01:01:53.597
You can join the other storks after all!

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:55.599
Ahem. Mm.

01:01:55.632 --> 01:01:58.201
Huh? Oh...

01:02:00.036 --> 01:02:03.907
"Other storks"?

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.476
Claudius was right.

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:09.946
You all were. I'm not a stork.

01:02:09.979 --> 01:02:12.549
I'll never be one.

01:02:12.582 --> 01:02:15.451
I'm just a sparrow.

01:02:20.123 --> 01:02:22.692
You really love them, don't you?

01:02:22.726 --> 01:02:24.193
Your storks.

01:02:24.227 --> 01:02:26.963
Mm-hmm.

01:02:26.996 --> 01:02:30.667
Then I say we show them
who you really are.

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:34.671
But... what if they don't want me?

01:02:34.704 --> 01:02:38.508
There's only one way to find out.

01:02:38.542 --> 01:02:41.277
Are... are you sure?

01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:43.680
- Mm-hmm.
- Otherwise, I'll adopt!

01:02:43.713 --> 01:02:46.215
Oh!

01:02:48.685 --> 01:02:50.820
I just did a Gloria half-Gainer!

01:02:50.854 --> 01:02:52.689
Come on, bird of paradise.

01:02:52.722 --> 01:02:55.024
Let's find a place to sleep it off.

01:02:55.058 --> 01:02:56.159
All right.

01:02:56.192 --> 01:02:58.828
Hey, maybe there's a disco on this tub!

01:03:10.574 --> 01:03:12.576
Hmm.

01:03:16.012 --> 01:03:19.549
Storks! Prepare to land!

01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:22.852
We can rest here until the heat passes.

01:03:24.588 --> 01:03:27.691
Ahh, what a lovely death gulley!

01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:30.694
But... there was water here last year!

01:03:30.727 --> 01:03:32.261
I'm never wrong about these things!

01:03:32.295 --> 01:03:34.197
The riverbed dried up.

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:38.702
Humans built another one
of their stupid dams.

01:03:39.769 --> 01:03:42.572
I know some other water
holes around here.

01:03:42.606 --> 01:03:44.708
I could show you, if you like.

01:03:44.741 --> 01:03:48.845
Thank you, sir, but your
assistance is not required.

01:03:48.878 --> 01:03:50.079
Hmm.

01:03:50.113 --> 01:03:53.617
Yeah? Fine. Storks!

01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:56.853
I'll go find water. Do not wander off.

01:03:56.886 --> 01:03:59.956
You could've accepted his help.
He seemed nice.

01:03:59.989 --> 01:04:02.759
Our flock can take care of itself.

01:04:02.792 --> 01:04:04.260
I know what I'm doing.

01:04:04.293 --> 01:04:07.897
Yeah... I can see that.

01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:10.366
You will not speak to me
in this way, Max!

01:04:10.399 --> 01:04:11.801
Stop it, will you?

01:04:11.835 --> 01:04:14.738
I'm only being reasonable,

01:04:14.771 --> 01:04:17.741
and doing what is best for all of us.

01:04:17.774 --> 01:04:19.308
All of us? Really?

01:04:19.342 --> 01:04:21.778
Even my little brother?!

01:04:21.811 --> 01:04:23.647
- You just don't get it!
- Max!

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.382
Stay with the flock!

01:04:26.415 --> 01:04:29.152
Go after him!

01:04:29.185 --> 01:04:31.587
Max!

01:04:36.325 --> 01:04:38.795
Big mean dummy.

01:04:38.828 --> 01:04:41.064
Jerk.

01:04:41.097 --> 01:04:42.832
It's a dangerous place!

01:04:42.866 --> 01:04:44.634
I hate you!

01:04:46.169 --> 01:04:48.304
Oh? Oh!

01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:56.846
He-hello?

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.114
Who's there...

01:05:01.818 --> 01:05:04.654
Max? My boy?

01:05:10.694 --> 01:05:13.029
I can't believe we're in Tangier!

01:05:14.798 --> 01:05:16.933
Africa!

01:05:18.735 --> 01:05:20.336
Hot stuff! Ooh, baby!

01:05:20.369 --> 01:05:22.371
Which way to the Great Lake, Olga?

01:05:22.405 --> 01:05:24.708
Hm... let's see.

01:05:24.741 --> 01:05:25.675
Richard!

01:05:25.709 --> 01:05:28.044
You're that sparrow
who thinks he's a stork!

01:05:28.077 --> 01:05:30.046
We have some good news for you.

01:05:30.079 --> 01:05:32.348
- Your flock is nearby!
- Oh!

01:05:32.381 --> 01:05:34.317
Just in!

01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:36.185
They're, like, totally in trouble!

01:05:36.219 --> 01:05:38.855
A-something about
the Flock Leader's son...

01:05:38.888 --> 01:05:40.356
"Wax"?

01:05:40.389 --> 01:05:41.725
Max!

01:05:41.758 --> 01:05:42.625
That's the one!

01:05:42.658 --> 01:05:45.361
He vanished without a trace.

01:05:45.394 --> 01:05:47.463
- By the oasis.
- Oasis?

01:05:47.496 --> 01:05:48.965
I need to get there now!

01:05:48.998 --> 01:05:51.367
Er, maybe we could take him, darling.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:55.038
- It's not that far.
- What?! Get offline?!

01:05:55.071 --> 01:05:56.906
Did you catch a virus?

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.742
Come on! Hurry! Please!

01:05:58.775 --> 01:06:01.177
We got to help him, snookums!

01:06:03.747 --> 01:06:06.082
Hey! This is better than I remembered!

01:06:06.115 --> 01:06:07.917
Come, my lovebird!

01:06:07.951 --> 01:06:10.820
Never! I'll miss a personality quiz!

01:06:10.854 --> 01:06:12.421
- Whoa!
- Trust me.

01:06:12.455 --> 01:06:14.090
You don't want to miss this.

01:06:18.427 --> 01:06:21.931
Everything's so... real!

01:06:21.965 --> 01:06:24.100
- Hurry! To the oasis!
- Love!

01:06:24.133 --> 01:06:28.872
Oh, well! There goes my vacation.

01:06:28.905 --> 01:06:30.874
Oh, I wish I'd brought my sunglasses!

01:06:34.477 --> 01:06:36.880
Max!

01:06:36.913 --> 01:06:40.884
Max!

01:06:40.917 --> 01:06:44.821
It's impossible!

01:06:44.854 --> 01:06:46.756
If only that boy had listened to me...

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:49.058
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know what else...

01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:50.994
Where is Max?!

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:56.532
Richard?

01:06:56.565 --> 01:06:58.902
How... how can that be?

01:06:58.935 --> 01:07:01.905
Mom! What happened to Max?

01:07:01.938 --> 01:07:02.972
He ran away.

01:07:03.006 --> 01:07:04.841
And... and we found his footsteps,

01:07:04.874 --> 01:07:06.442
leading into this tunnel.

01:07:06.475 --> 01:07:09.212
I tried everything,
but I couldn't get in.

01:07:09.245 --> 01:07:12.115
Not good... Not good at all.

01:07:12.148 --> 01:07:16.085
This is the entrance to the honey
badger's underground lair.

01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:18.988
Honey badger doesn't
sound so bad, right?

01:07:19.022 --> 01:07:20.824
Yeah! I'm gonna get Max out of there.

01:07:20.857 --> 01:07:21.991
Oh, no!

01:07:22.025 --> 01:07:25.094
The honey badger's the most
fearless predator of all.

01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:28.397
Instant death is pretty much a given.

01:07:28.431 --> 01:07:31.935
- Uh-huh? How would you know?
- Basic cable.

01:07:31.968 --> 01:07:34.003
- Ah.
- Okay, I'm going in.

01:07:34.037 --> 01:07:36.139
No! It's too dangerous for you...

01:07:36.172 --> 01:07:37.807
We have no other choice!

01:07:37.841 --> 01:07:40.343
You storks don't fit
through that entrance.

01:07:40.376 --> 01:07:41.945
We're coming with you!

01:07:41.978 --> 01:07:45.314
We'll show this badger
some honey, right, Kiki?

01:07:45.348 --> 01:07:47.016
Right, Kiki?!

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:50.987
Remind me again why I'm signing
up for this kamikaze mission?

01:07:52.221 --> 01:07:54.858
Because you tricked us and you feel bad.

01:07:54.891 --> 01:07:57.526
Oh. Yeah. Count me in.

01:07:59.028 --> 01:08:00.964
- Richard!
- What?!

01:08:00.997 --> 01:08:06.602
Be careful. Please.

01:08:06.635 --> 01:08:07.971
Hmm.

01:08:13.542 --> 01:08:15.979
I'll guard the entrance!

01:08:24.888 --> 01:08:26.956
Oh, this was a bad idea.

01:08:29.558 --> 01:08:31.060
And I know bad ideas.

01:08:31.094 --> 01:08:33.062
"Bad idea" is my middle name!

01:08:33.095 --> 01:08:35.331
Shh!

01:08:36.599 --> 01:08:38.968
I'm a disco-lover, not a badger-fighter!

01:08:39.002 --> 01:08:41.069
Oh!

01:08:42.404 --> 01:08:43.939
He must be this way.

01:08:43.973 --> 01:08:47.576
Good. So let's go...

01:08:47.609 --> 01:08:48.877
that way.

01:08:48.912 --> 01:08:50.013
Okay, okay!

01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:55.885
That's slightly creepy.

01:08:55.919 --> 01:08:59.923
Is that... Max?

01:08:59.956 --> 01:09:02.926
That look like bird bones to you?

01:09:02.959 --> 01:09:06.162
How should I know? I'm vegan.

01:09:06.194 --> 01:09:09.198
And I'm a meat-eater. Remember that.

01:09:14.203 --> 01:09:17.073
So, ah, you guys give any more thought

01:09:17.106 --> 01:09:19.341
to my "running away" idea?

01:09:19.375 --> 01:09:22.611
Everyone, take a tunnel.
But be silent, okay?

01:09:24.046 --> 01:09:25.881
That means you, Showtune.

01:09:27.216 --> 01:09:29.218
- Hey!
- Shh!

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:30.419
Take your tunnel!

01:09:30.453 --> 01:09:33.122
Can't we at least flip a coin?

01:09:33.156 --> 01:09:34.357
Shake a tailfeather!

01:09:35.959 --> 01:09:39.162
Well, at least I'll leave
a gorgeous corpse.

01:09:43.066 --> 01:09:44.968
Max?

01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:49.104
Max?

01:10:02.685 --> 01:10:04.087
Hmm.

01:10:07.156 --> 01:10:08.457
Mmm, hearty crunch.

01:10:08.491 --> 01:10:11.460
With a delightfully gooey center.

01:10:11.494 --> 01:10:13.496
Max?

01:10:13.529 --> 01:10:15.231
Whoa!

01:10:29.478 --> 01:10:31.580
Max!

01:10:31.614 --> 01:10:33.316
Is he okay?

01:10:33.349 --> 01:10:35.118
Phew!

01:10:36.785 --> 01:10:40.289
- Get up, Max!
- Oh.

01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:44.093
Oh? Little brother?

01:10:44.127 --> 01:10:47.130
Oh! How did you... get here?

01:10:47.163 --> 01:10:51.034
Shh! We've gotta get you out of here.

01:10:51.067 --> 01:10:52.135
Where's Kiki?

01:10:52.168 --> 01:10:55.171
Oh, great.

01:10:55.204 --> 01:10:58.374
My dry-cleaning bill is
going to be astronomical!

01:11:04.247 --> 01:11:06.115
I'm seeing double. Triple. Quadruple!

01:11:09.818 --> 01:11:14.190
Running away! Running away!

01:11:18.061 --> 01:11:20.096
- It's him!
- Ooops! Sorry.

01:11:20.129 --> 01:11:21.097
Great.

01:11:21.130 --> 01:11:22.398
This way out!

01:11:24.233 --> 01:11:26.102
Which tunnel?

01:11:28.071 --> 01:11:29.105
This one looks good!

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.176
Kiki!

01:11:36.212 --> 01:11:38.681
I'm too colorful to die!

01:13:03.299 --> 01:13:05.501
Son! Oh!

01:13:05.534 --> 01:13:07.303
I'm so sorry.

01:13:07.336 --> 01:13:08.804
Dad! Richard's still in there.

01:13:08.837 --> 01:13:09.905
No!

01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:23.286
Ah!

01:13:24.687 --> 01:13:26.189
Richard! Get out of there!

01:13:33.196 --> 01:13:35.598
Don't you touch him, you beast!

01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:45.241
- It's collapsing!
- That cave wasn't up to code!

01:13:48.811 --> 01:13:50.213
Oh!

01:13:50.246 --> 01:13:53.182
Here, honey bunny!

01:13:53.216 --> 01:13:55.718
Looking for a tasty sparrow?

01:14:08.231 --> 01:14:10.199
Oh!

01:14:33.856 --> 01:14:35.524
Richard!

01:14:35.558 --> 01:14:37.560
Where... where is he?

01:14:39.027 --> 01:14:40.729
- Richard?
- Come on out!

01:14:43.266 --> 01:14:46.269
Can you see him, Oleg?

01:14:46.302 --> 01:14:48.504
Oh, no.

01:15:01.884 --> 01:15:04.620
Huh?

01:15:06.822 --> 01:15:08.924
Do you see what I see?

01:15:08.957 --> 01:15:10.793
What?

01:15:14.763 --> 01:15:16.332
Richard!

01:15:16.365 --> 01:15:18.567
- Oh!
- It's Richard!

01:15:18.601 --> 01:15:19.735
Yeah! Ha ha!

01:15:19.768 --> 01:15:20.969
What?

01:15:25.941 --> 01:15:28.043
Just in time, little brother.

01:15:28.076 --> 01:15:32.348
Oh, you sure know
how to make an entrance.

01:15:33.782 --> 01:15:36.619
Oh... I'll never let you go again!

01:15:39.322 --> 01:15:40.923
How did you ever get here?

01:15:40.956 --> 01:15:43.892
Everybody, these are my friends,

01:15:43.926 --> 01:15:45.828
- Olga and Kiki...
- Ahem.

01:15:45.861 --> 01:15:48.431
And Oleg.

01:15:48.464 --> 01:15:49.931
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for them.

01:15:49.932 --> 01:15:52.335
Enchanté!

01:15:52.368 --> 01:15:55.070
It was our pleasure, right, Oleg?

01:15:59.342 --> 01:16:02.377
I owe you an apology, Richard.

01:16:04.112 --> 01:16:06.815
I should have believed in you.

01:16:06.849 --> 01:16:11.286
Sparrow or stork... you are my son.

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:21.430
I... I can be part of the family?

01:16:21.464 --> 01:16:24.099
Nothing would make me prouder.

01:16:30.473 --> 01:16:31.840
Mmm.

01:16:31.874 --> 01:16:33.709
Aww!

01:16:36.078 --> 01:16:38.881
Next stop, the Great Lake!

01:16:38.914 --> 01:16:41.116
Richard...

01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:43.352
would you lead us?

01:16:43.386 --> 01:16:45.488
Really?! Me?

01:16:45.521 --> 01:16:49.625
When you're ready, give the signal.

01:16:49.658 --> 01:16:51.527
Hey, Richard?

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.497
South is that way!

01:17:00.436 --> 01:17:03.639
Follow me!

01:17:03.672 --> 01:17:05.408
Wait for us!

01:17:05.441 --> 01:17:07.810
We're not all storks, you know!

01:17:07.843 --> 01:17:10.145
Come on, everyone! Keep the pace!

01:17:10.178 --> 01:17:13.516
Jeez, little brother!
Been training?

01:17:16.485 --> 01:17:18.921
Ah...

01:17:29.031 --> 01:17:31.400
Whoa! That must be it!

01:17:31.434 --> 01:17:35.538
Yeah! The Great Lake!

01:17:38.741 --> 01:17:42.678
Ooh! Now that's what I call
a deluxe resort!

01:17:42.711 --> 01:17:45.748
Thanks, Oleg.

01:17:45.781 --> 01:17:48.050
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:17:49.618 --> 01:17:52.688
We did it. We really did it!

01:17:52.721 --> 01:17:56.058
Woo-hoo!

01:17:56.091 --> 01:18:00.963
Come on, guys! Yeah!
