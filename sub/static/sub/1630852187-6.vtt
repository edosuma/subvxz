WEBVTT

00:09.920 --> 00:11.680
In concentration camps,

00:13.320 --> 00:15.200
respect is a given.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.800
Well, here's it's going to be the same.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.040
You're going to dig the tunnel

00:24.040 --> 00:25.920
until your hands bleed!

00:28.200 --> 00:29.360
At night

00:30.000 --> 00:31.400
you may cry in pain

00:31.960 --> 00:33.240
in your cot,

00:33.440 --> 00:36.600
but you will keep on digging!

00:42.200 --> 00:44.760
You'll be on shifts without rest.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.680
Otherwise, an epic punishment awaits you.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.560
Just like your leader.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.880
A man who will kill
if he betrays us again.

01:07.480 --> 01:10.680
Who will kill if he ever
yearns for freedom again.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.760
Whose sweat,

01:17.480 --> 01:18.320
kills.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.040
A man of explosive nature.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.440
Now they're going to be scared of you,
Arturo.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.080
Although we've always known
you're "the bomb".

01:36.720 --> 01:39.960
You're an outcast,
so you'll stay here, secluded.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.520
Helsinki and everyone else, to the tunnel!

01:43.800 --> 01:45.440
Come on, let's go!

01:46.160 --> 01:47.520
Let's go, quickly!

02:04.680 --> 02:08.480
Seismographs detected
unusual activity underneath the factory.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.520
The kidnappers have
increased the digging pace of the tunnel.

02:12.840 --> 02:13.960
They'll finish it soon.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.800
TUESDAY 05:41 PM

02:16.880 --> 02:17.760
How much is left?

02:17.840 --> 02:20.160
HOUR 103 OF THE HEIST

02:20.240 --> 02:22.840
Two meters, according to the GPR.
Two and a half meters.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.040
Where are they exiting?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.160
We think right here.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.440
In a drainpipe 15 meters
behind the building.

02:33.400 --> 02:37.280
Attention, everyone. I want you all ready.
Warn underground units.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.640
I want 20 men guarding
that drainpipe now.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.440
You know what guilty people do
when they are taken to the crime scene?

02:56.120 --> 02:57.520
They don't stop talking.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.200
About weather, politics,

03:00.720 --> 03:02.120
they make jokes.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.760
Because they're nervous.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.040
They can't stand the silence.

03:10.040 --> 03:10.960
But you...

03:13.760 --> 03:14.920
you don't say a thing.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.880
What do you want me to talk about?

03:26.400 --> 03:27.440
Who are you?

03:28.360 --> 03:29.360
Sergio Marquina.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.000
Sergio?

03:34.000 --> 03:34.920
Salva,

03:36.080 --> 03:37.000
the Professor?

03:37.280 --> 03:39.200
The person who has kept

03:39.600 --> 03:41.440
all the police, the CNI,

03:41.520 --> 03:43.000
and the Special Forces in check?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.480
The man I've been talking with
on the phone for five days,

03:48.880 --> 03:50.440
who I told what

03:50.920 --> 03:53.880
clothes I wear and even
what color my orgasms are?

03:56.800 --> 03:58.120
And which one are you?

04:04.200 --> 04:07.600
Why aren't your fingerprints
in the national ID database?

04:12.240 --> 04:15.160
I stopped renewing my ID
before they went digital.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.920
When?

04:21.480 --> 04:22.400
More than

04:22.800 --> 04:23.760
twenty years ago.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.200
That opens up a world of possibilities,
doesn't it?

04:36.800 --> 04:40.720
Because no one is going to report
the disappearance of a man who

04:41.320 --> 04:42.240
doesn't exist.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.600
It will make it easy for me
to burn your corpse.

04:52.520 --> 04:53.960
Is that what you want?

04:56.040 --> 04:57.280
To kill and burn me?

05:00.760 --> 05:01.640
Yes.

05:02.920 --> 05:03.840
I sure do.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.560
Look...

05:09.040 --> 05:10.840
perhaps as an inspector,

05:11.520 --> 05:14.880
I shouldn't tell this to the person
who organized the heist

05:14.960 --> 05:16.760
at the National Mint factory.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.040
But as a woman...

05:22.160 --> 05:23.400
as a woman

05:23.640 --> 05:26.480
who has spent years
being afraid of everything,

05:27.160 --> 05:28.080
everything,

05:29.240 --> 05:30.720
who trusted someone,

05:31.200 --> 05:32.320
someone who knew

05:32.720 --> 05:34.880
how fragile and vulnerable she was,

05:35.240 --> 05:38.840
who's been fooling her
from the fucking beginning!

05:39.640 --> 05:42.520
Then it wouldn't be that far-fetched,
don't you think?

05:44.520 --> 05:45.560
You could have...

05:46.120 --> 05:47.720
you could have approached me,

05:48.240 --> 05:49.320
coaxed me,

05:50.400 --> 05:53.840
planted a bug on me.
A fucking bug, goddamn it!

05:54.760 --> 05:57.040
But no. No, you couldn't.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.360
Yesterday we were dreaming together.

06:02.440 --> 06:03.360
Shit.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.040
Talking about the future. The future!

06:10.120 --> 06:11.680
Who the hell are you?

06:11.920 --> 06:14.120
What are you, some disturbed fuck?

06:18.480 --> 06:20.160
It was all planned, Raquel.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.040
Everything. It was all...

06:25.000 --> 06:27.080
I'm sorry.
It was all planned out...

06:27.440 --> 06:29.120
except what happened between us.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.400
I don't know, I broke my own rules.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.440
What?

06:32.520 --> 06:34.480
I didn't consider that variable.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.160
What the hell are you saying?

06:36.320 --> 06:38.280
-What variable?
-Falling in love with you.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.720
You really think I'll let you
go on with this crap?

06:45.480 --> 06:46.400
Son of a bitch.

06:47.280 --> 06:50.720
That I'll sit back
while you lie to my fucking face

06:50.800 --> 06:52.680
as if I were a 15-year-old girl?

06:52.760 --> 06:54.040
I'm not lying, Raquel.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.280
I fell in love.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.720
Say it again.

07:01.000 --> 07:01.880
Say it again.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.760
I dare you to say it again!

07:04.320 --> 07:05.280
Raquel.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.640
I fell in love with you.

07:21.040 --> 07:21.880
I'm so sorry.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.160
Fine.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.520
Fine.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.960
05:46 PM

09:56.640 --> 09:57.560
Berlin,

09:57.720 --> 09:58.960
I need to talk to you.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.320
Of course. I'm the boss again,

10:03.680 --> 10:05.360
I need my pups to feed me.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.360
What exactly did the Professor say?

10:08.800 --> 10:09.800
about Tokyo?

10:11.720 --> 10:13.320
He said he would try to free her.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.640
And how the hell is he going
to do that?

10:19.640 --> 10:20.640
Rio,

10:21.720 --> 10:23.040
he's not doing it himself.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.680
Who is?

10:25.560 --> 10:28.600
The four Serbs who dug the tunnel
five years ago.

10:29.560 --> 10:33.000
They're the wildcard for extreme setbacks.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.920
-When?
-I don't know.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.320
You feel her absence, right?

10:46.080 --> 10:48.000
Those who stay always have it worse.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.160
Instead, she will be

10:53.640 --> 10:55.520
broadening her experience,

10:57.240 --> 10:58.840
enhancing her senses,

11:00.440 --> 11:01.280
entertained.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.760
Would you take the deal from the cops?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.320
What does it matter?

11:08.320 --> 11:10.160
What would happen if we got out of here?

11:11.120 --> 11:12.360
Would we stay together?

11:14.800 --> 11:16.320
Betraying your friends.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.200
My friends with city names?

11:19.080 --> 11:20.680
Tokyo, Berlin, Moscow, Denver.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.360
I think my friends
with city names are really cool.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.040
And I'll tell you something.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.000
Try to hide

11:29.400 --> 11:30.560
if you accept the deal,

11:31.800 --> 11:34.200
because if I see you,
I'll put a bullet in your head.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.560
Women are quicker to move on.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.600
You should know, just in case.

11:43.720 --> 11:44.960
Tokyo is hot-headed,

11:46.320 --> 11:47.320
but she'll be back

11:48.280 --> 11:49.800
and we'll be together.

11:51.640 --> 11:52.520
I know it.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.360
Sure.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.600
Of course you will.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.000
I've always thought that.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.560
If you betray us and leave,

12:26.720 --> 12:28.640
and you need to call me when you're sorry,

12:30.320 --> 12:31.360
because believe me,

12:33.720 --> 12:34.560
you will be,

12:37.080 --> 12:38.800
you can call me at Alison's number.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.480
I'll keep it on.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.360
The cops will be listening
but who cares.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.160
ACTIVE SIGNAL REPEATER

13:07.560 --> 13:10.400
Suarez,
Alison Parker's phone has switched on.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.600
Try hacking it.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.680
Sealed camera, sir.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.800
They're not calling or sending anything.

13:46.600 --> 13:47.960
PAINTING AND RENOVATIONS

13:50.840 --> 13:52.880
-What the fuck are you doing?
-God damn it!

13:54.000 --> 13:55.560
This is convoy 727,

13:55.640 --> 13:56.520
we're getting hit!

13:56.600 --> 13:59.640
Base to convoy,
we did not copy that, please repeat.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.280
They've got jammers.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.160
God fucking damn it!

14:03.400 --> 14:05.640
My guardian angel had not forsaken me.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.360
And I felt like I was
on the haunted house ride.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.720
It's a bomb!
What the hell is going on over there!

14:12.800 --> 14:13.800
They set an explosive!

14:13.880 --> 14:17.000
A dark tunnel where you don't know
when you'll be startled.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.640
-We're fucked!
-Shut tup!

14:19.200 --> 14:20.120
But how fun!

14:20.600 --> 14:21.600
What's going on?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.320
What the hell is going on?

14:24.560 --> 14:26.000
Let's go, they're shooting!

14:26.080 --> 14:28.080
-Shut the hell up!
-We're fucked, Perez!

14:28.160 --> 14:29.840
Shut up, goddamn it. Let me think!

14:38.800 --> 14:40.000
Zero!

15:04.600 --> 15:05.440
Stay alert.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.600
Okay. No, stop.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.920
Put the guns down or I'll shoot her.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.360
Put the guns down or I'll shoot her.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.440
If you shoot the girl, you die.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.880
If you shoot me,

15:37.840 --> 15:38.960
you die.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.120
If you let go of the girl,

15:41.800 --> 15:42.640
you live.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.120
If only every decision
in this world was that easy,

15:46.800 --> 15:47.760
right?

16:04.080 --> 16:05.040
Rio.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.640
Rio!

16:12.200 --> 16:15.640
I noticed you didn't agree
with what Helsinki was doing.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.360
You're not like them.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.480
You're a good boy.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.560
I have a son your age, you know?

16:31.440 --> 16:32.280
The eldest.

16:35.640 --> 16:36.840
He's a good boy too.

16:39.600 --> 16:40.600
Help me, please.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.640
I want to see my son.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.560
I found this machine to make passports.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.720
-No...
-Monica,

17:17.160 --> 17:18.040
listen to me.

17:20.120 --> 17:21.640
You can do whatever you want.

17:22.320 --> 17:23.640
What if you change your mind?

17:24.800 --> 17:27.720
It would be great
for you to have a new one. Besides...

17:28.080 --> 17:29.520
this is real. Is good stuff.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.960
I know. I work here.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.320
-It's easy. We make it...
-No, really.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.680
if you don't want it, toss it,
or keep it as a souvenir..

17:38.000 --> 17:39.160
It's just two minutes.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.600
-Let's do it?
-Okay, fine.

17:43.000 --> 17:43.920
Is it plugged in?

17:44.080 --> 17:45.280
-Yes.
-Okay.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.600
What name do I use?

17:51.880 --> 17:53.280
-Agata.
-Agata?

17:53.720 --> 17:56.840
-What's the matter?
-It's a porn star's name.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.640
Agata is a hot chick's name.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.320
If you were ugly, I would say,

18:00.480 --> 18:02.760
-Felisa or Maricruz...
-Maria!

18:03.000 --> 18:04.880
-Maria Fernandez.
-Maria Fernandez?

18:04.960 --> 18:07.600
That's not a name.
Nobody's believing that. Trust me,

18:07.680 --> 18:09.160
-I know.
-It's discrete.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.600
Agata sounds expensive. It's classy.
Use Agata.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.080
Here you go.

18:14.600 --> 18:15.480
Thanks.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.480
Write "born in Madrid"

18:25.000 --> 18:26.440
and whichever year you want.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.960
-We're making a passport.
-I see.

18:32.920 --> 18:33.960
In case in the end,

18:34.320 --> 18:35.320
she runs or...

18:36.560 --> 18:37.600
comes with us.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.840
Who do you think stole your gun?

18:50.080 --> 18:51.120
Let's go outside.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.120
Suarez.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.320
I'm calling from the National Court.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.440
The convoy with Silene Oliveira

19:05.520 --> 19:08.240
was expected 15 minutes ago
and it's not here.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.600
We haven't heard anything.

19:10.000 --> 19:10.920
Keep me informed.

19:12.000 --> 19:12.840
Gomez,

19:12.920 --> 19:15.880
I need two units on
Oliveira's route to the courthouse.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.400
She hasn't arrived.
I need to know what's going on.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.320
Understood.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.880
Put this on.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.560
Only contact the Professor.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.240
He'll say what to do.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.440
Never in my life had I felt so free.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.160
But that time,

21:03.720 --> 21:05.720
the Professor's plan wouldn't work.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.760
I know I let the pressure get to me,

21:24.160 --> 21:25.560
I was wrong, but...

21:26.240 --> 21:27.240
please,

21:30.240 --> 21:31.320
I don't deserve this.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.360
Please,

21:36.800 --> 21:37.880
I'm asking you,

21:38.520 --> 21:41.000
if there's any dignity left in you,
please.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.400
I can't breathe.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.000
I can't breathe. Help me.

21:46.000 --> 21:46.840
Help me,

21:47.480 --> 21:48.320
please.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.560
We're coming in.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.840
Take your food and sit down.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.200
One meter between each one.
Come on.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.920
That's it, just like that,

22:09.280 --> 22:10.280
joyfully.

22:10.360 --> 22:13.800
Helsinki, say hello to little Arturo.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.520
Something doesn't make sense.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.480
They said that if I sweat too much

22:29.560 --> 22:31.960
I would blow up,
and yet here they put me,

22:33.120 --> 22:35.200
locked in this god-awful heat.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.320
-In this dreadful heat...
-It's best

22:37.400 --> 22:39.680
if you stay calm and quiet.

22:39.760 --> 22:40.800
It doesn't make sense.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.280
-What?
-The bomb, that's what doesn't make sense!

22:44.240 --> 22:47.280
You think they are going
to risk me tripping or sweating,

22:47.360 --> 22:49.200
blowing up the whole plan? No...

22:51.480 --> 22:53.760
No, that would be insane.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.960
-They don't work like that.
-Shut up.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.400
They're trying
to psychologically terrorize us.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.840
They're trying to scare us.
This isn't real.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.120
It's a bluff.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.520
I don't want to know, so shut up.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.720
I'm taking it off.

23:06.960 --> 23:09.320
I'm going to take it off, I can't take it.

23:10.680 --> 23:11.960
It's okay.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.880
-If it was real we wouldn't be so close.
-Stop and sit down!

23:14.960 --> 23:17.120
Who are you to tell us what to do, brat?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.760
It's your fault
that we're all locked in here!

23:27.840 --> 23:29.760
-My fault?
-Yes, your fault.

23:30.840 --> 23:34.240
You are the director
and eight morons managed to slip in

23:34.680 --> 23:36.160
like they owned the place.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.600
Is there any mint
in the world that has been robbed?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.160
Just this one, right?

23:44.600 --> 23:45.640
Congratulations,

23:46.720 --> 23:47.920
you've made history.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.280
Now, please, don't blow us up,

23:52.160 --> 23:53.600
and sit down.

23:56.720 --> 23:57.640
Sit down.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.760
Headquarters, do you copy?
The van was hijacked.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.480
-There's no trace of Silene Oliveira.
-Copy that. Wait for instructions.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.920
Attention, we have a fugitive!

24:20.040 --> 24:21.560
Initiate Operation Cage!

24:48.400 --> 24:49.480
He wasn't there.

24:51.000 --> 24:51.920
He wasn't there.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.800
He had arranged it all.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.120
He had saved me.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.200
How could he not be there?

24:59.760 --> 25:03.400
On that October afternoon after I escaped
they deployed Operation Cage.

25:03.560 --> 25:06.200
It might ring a bell
from terrorist threats.

25:06.280 --> 25:09.680
They cut off all the exits
to the city at once.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.040
Everything collapses

25:11.360 --> 25:13.680
and you're trapped.
You can only hide.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.680
My problem was that
my hideout was the hangar.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.120
And the person who had to
let me in was the Professor.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.240
But I was never too good at waiting.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.840
What's that?

26:10.280 --> 26:13.680
The only truth I know about you
is that you're a professional liar.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.560
And call me paranoid,
but you won't lie to me again.

26:19.640 --> 26:20.640
I can guarantee it.

26:26.440 --> 26:27.960
Do you think I don't know that?

26:28.440 --> 26:29.560
That I'm an idiot?

26:30.040 --> 26:32.040
Of course she stole the gun from me.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.280
But changed her mind,

26:33.360 --> 26:36.280
otherwise I would be in a fucking
box with Oslo.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.040
She helped you. That's great.

26:38.120 --> 26:41.040
But you don't have to make her
a passport or take her with you.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.320
What if I want to?

26:42.840 --> 26:45.880
What if I want to live with her
and raise her son?

26:45.960 --> 26:49.560
You're going to be fucked enough
to be carrying more burdens.

26:49.640 --> 26:52.000
Not a burden.
It's a girl who loves me and a child,

26:52.080 --> 26:53.640
who is innocent.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.880
-It's a mess you shouldn't get into.
-If I do, it's my choice.

26:57.240 --> 27:00.800
Sometimes we try to help others
and end up sinking ourselves, damn it.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.120
If I sink, I'll swim, like always, dad.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.440
It's not like that, dammit!

27:05.520 --> 27:06.520
I know,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.560
I tried to help your mother
every damn day of my life.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.560
Where's this shit coming from now?

27:20.320 --> 27:21.520
Mama abandoned us.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.480
Where's this shit coming from now?

27:29.680 --> 27:30.760
We abandoned her.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.880
She was going to be the end of us.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.120
I put her in a clinic in Barcelona.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.040
It cost 200,000 pesetas.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.800
And in less than 24 hours
she showed up at my hostel

27:47.440 --> 27:49.720
-high as a kite on smack.
-What did you do?

27:51.120 --> 27:52.240
It was the fourth time.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.440
I'd lost my savings.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.520
What the fuck did you do?

28:00.480 --> 28:02.000
She wanted to buy more.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.920
I put her in the car...

28:05.800 --> 28:08.400
and dropped her off at a roundabout
in Martorell,

28:08.520 --> 28:10.600
next to a place where they sold smack.

28:15.680 --> 28:16.800
I didn't wait for her.

28:18.000 --> 28:18.960
I went to pick you up

28:21.440 --> 28:22.320
to move out.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.520
You left my mother at a roundabout?

28:34.200 --> 28:36.480
That's why I got you into all this mess.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.920
Because I don't want you
to live the life I lived.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.320
I want you to be free.

28:40.440 --> 28:43.400
-I want you to start from scratch.
-You don't abandon a mother.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.480
You get her clean.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.200
You had me believe she was a bitch.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.880
I thought maybe I was to blame
for her leaving.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.920
It was her or us.

29:06.120 --> 29:09.240
I won't break your skull
because we need you to get out of here.

29:10.880 --> 29:11.880
When we get out,

29:12.720 --> 29:14.080
you and I are nothing.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.120
Two strangers.

29:17.280 --> 29:18.120
Denver

29:19.000 --> 29:19.840
and Moscow.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.240
Did you finish the passport?

29:54.560 --> 29:55.400
Yes.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.280
Denver, are you okay?

30:15.920 --> 30:16.800
It's fine.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.520
I used Agata in the end.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.320
I drove nowhere, frantically.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.760
In a fraction of a second
I knew where to go.

31:05.880 --> 31:06.720
The problem

31:07.720 --> 31:10.560
was that it was the most
guarded place in Spain.

31:46.800 --> 31:47.960
Take a deep breath.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.040
Are you nervous?

31:57.400 --> 31:58.240
No, I'm fine.

32:01.800 --> 32:02.760
You see those lines?

32:04.200 --> 32:06.360
Every one of your lies will draw

32:06.440 --> 32:07.560
some ugly curves

32:09.640 --> 32:11.920
due to alteration in blood pressure,

32:12.400 --> 32:13.600
heart rate,

32:13.960 --> 32:15.160
breathing.

32:16.840 --> 32:17.960
So don't lie to me

32:18.640 --> 32:19.520
or I'll know.

32:24.080 --> 32:24.960
Name.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Sergio Marquina.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.280
Place of birth.

32:35.920 --> 32:36.960
San Sebastian.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.680
Did you know you would destroy Angel?

32:49.600 --> 32:50.480
Yes.

32:55.560 --> 32:56.400
Was it you

32:56.800 --> 32:58.320
who caused his accident?

32:59.120 --> 33:00.000
No.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.520
Was it your idea to rob the Royal Mint?

33:09.560 --> 33:10.440
No.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.080
Whose was it?

33:18.600 --> 33:19.480
My father's.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.880
He died before carrying it out,
so it's kind of a homage.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.200
The fucking apple story.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.040
The fucking organic cider story

33:36.240 --> 33:37.640
you told me in bed yesterday

33:38.400 --> 33:39.720
was the story of the heist?

33:41.680 --> 33:44.360
And I listened to you like an idiot.

33:44.680 --> 33:48.080
You've been mocking me
since the beginning.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.360
I was not mocking you.
Look at the polygraph, please.

33:52.560 --> 33:53.400
Look at it.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.240
My father had a sick child,

34:01.000 --> 34:02.080
not a goddamn penny.

34:04.400 --> 34:05.560
What would you have done?

34:08.240 --> 34:10.280
He spent his time thinking about robberies

34:11.880 --> 34:13.960
to pay for a hospital
in the United States.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.440
Out of despair.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.520
To save my life.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.320
My life.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.520
Because nobody,

34:31.040 --> 34:31.920
nobody...

34:32.520 --> 34:33.360
helped him.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.240
And when he tried, he was shot to death

34:42.080 --> 34:43.120
at the doors of a...

34:44.840 --> 34:45.680
of a bank.

34:49.240 --> 34:50.760
That's the truth.

34:55.240 --> 34:57.960
I guess there are many ways
of understanding what is fair.

34:59.720 --> 35:02.720
Did you think I was an easy target
because I was an abused woman?

35:11.520 --> 35:12.360
Yes, I did.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.960
When you leaked to the press

35:18.840 --> 35:21.120
my refusal to release
eight hostages in favor

35:21.320 --> 35:22.320
of Alison Parker,

35:23.040 --> 35:25.480
did you know I was going to be
publicly lynched?

35:25.720 --> 35:29.240
That you were going to destroy my career
in front of my mother and daughter?

35:30.560 --> 35:31.440
Yes.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.240
Okay.

35:37.080 --> 35:38.560
You slept with me just because

35:38.800 --> 35:40.720
I'm the inspector in charge, right?

35:40.800 --> 35:41.720
No.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.160
You slept with me because
I'm the inspector...

35:44.240 --> 35:46.480
-No, no.
-Stop lying to me, dammit!

35:46.560 --> 35:47.520
I'm not lying.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.840
I have to believe
you have feelings for me?

35:49.920 --> 35:52.080
You don't have to believe anything.
Raquel,

35:52.160 --> 35:53.040
it's what I feel.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.120
I didn't expect it.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.080
It happened.
And it happened to you too.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.280
It happened to you too.
Why are we here if not?

36:03.360 --> 36:04.240
Huh?

36:08.320 --> 36:09.640
Why am I not in prison?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.160
What the fuck is this?

36:12.880 --> 36:14.920
Are you the crazy woman
from Misery or what?

36:15.000 --> 36:16.800
It's something that we're both feeling.

36:16.880 --> 36:19.320
Both, do you understand?
It happened to both.

36:26.880 --> 36:27.840
Yes, Suarez.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.080
Inspector,

36:30.640 --> 36:32.240
Silene Oliveira has escaped.

36:32.680 --> 36:34.320
- What?
-Going to the courthouse.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.200
She asked to testify before a judge.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.760
The convoy was hijacked by people,
apparently eastern European.

36:39.840 --> 36:42.800
I've initiated Operation Cage.
I hope they haven't left Madrid.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.880
Ask the judge immediately

36:44.960 --> 36:47.120
to issue an international arrest warrant.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.720
Cut off roads, ports and airports.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.680
I want patrols on every border.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.440
Tokyo escaped.

37:06.800 --> 37:07.680
Was it you

37:08.160 --> 37:10.880
who freed a murderer
from a maximum security prison

37:10.960 --> 37:12.000
while held here?

37:19.560 --> 37:20.440
Actually,

37:20.520 --> 37:23.280
I left everything ready
before meeting you at the cafe.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.720
I apologize for receiving you like this,
but I just got here.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.960
Radko, I'm so sorry about your brother.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.440
You got it all planned in detail, right?

37:55.800 --> 37:57.480
Raquel, I've told you everything.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.760
I've come here
without resisting whatsoever.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.720
And if I let you interrogate me it's...

38:11.480 --> 38:12.360
because...

38:13.000 --> 38:15.560
I wanted to be honest with you.
I can't take it anymore.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.720
-The lying.
-Shut up.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.920
-I didn't want to hurt you anymore.
-Shut up!

38:21.000 --> 38:23.720
-This is a relief.
-Shut the fuck up, dammit!

38:25.160 --> 38:27.320
I won't listen to you anymore.
Look.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.680
From now on, anything you have to say,
you say it directly to the judge.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.280
Get up.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.360
Get up, dammit!

38:41.720 --> 38:43.160
Move, move.

38:44.520 --> 38:45.520
Move!

38:51.000 --> 38:51.880
Keep walking.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.840
-I'm very sorry, Raquel.
-Keep walking!

39:01.840 --> 39:02.960
I'm going to shoot you.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.240
I'm going to...

39:27.400 --> 39:30.240
Have you heard the expression
"to enter the lion's den"?

39:39.840 --> 39:41.520
It's a call to Alison Parker's phone

39:42.480 --> 39:44.560
-from an unknown number.
-Trace it.

39:55.760 --> 39:56.960
-Yes?
-Rio?

39:58.440 --> 39:59.560
It's Tokyo.

40:01.480 --> 40:02.480
It's Silene Oliveira.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.640
Record! Locate the call!

40:04.920 --> 40:06.520
Where are you? Wait!

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
They can hear us.

40:08.880 --> 40:09.840
It doesn't matter.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.000
This is a love call.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.600
And the police enjoy love.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.160
Listen to me.

40:18.720 --> 40:21.640
Remember the door my mother
used to draw when I was afraid?

40:22.600 --> 40:24.040
What door is she talking about?

40:24.480 --> 40:26.120
Yes, love. Of course I remember.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.400
-What about it?
-I'll cross it.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.080
I'll cross the door to heaven,

40:32.080 --> 40:33.880
because my guardian angel isn't around.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.400
In one minute.

40:43.120 --> 40:44.040
I love you.

40:44.800 --> 40:45.800
I love you too.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.720
What the hell was that about?

41:06.400 --> 41:07.760
It sounded like a goodbye.

41:23.920 --> 41:26.840
Attention. Unauthorized vehicle
entering the perimeter.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.600
Come on, everybody to your stations!

41:34.840 --> 41:35.880
Hey, you!

41:36.320 --> 41:37.240
It's her.

41:37.760 --> 41:38.680
The door...

41:39.640 --> 41:40.720
The door...

41:42.400 --> 41:43.560
Shit, the door!

41:46.160 --> 41:47.800
Hey, hey!

41:49.600 --> 41:50.600
Attention!

41:51.000 --> 41:52.320
It's Silene Oliveira!

41:55.200 --> 41:56.640
Tokyo is back!

41:58.520 --> 41:59.840
Tokyo is back!

42:00.040 --> 42:00.960
On the ground!

42:02.080 --> 42:04.080
We have to open the door, dammit!

42:05.000 --> 42:06.920
Shoot the target, shoot the biker!

42:07.520 --> 42:08.560
Attention, fire.

42:13.000 --> 42:13.920
Let's go!

42:22.440 --> 42:24.200
No! We have to cover her!

42:26.000 --> 42:28.120
Kidnapper in range, fire.

42:29.000 --> 42:29.840
Papa, look out!

42:32.920 --> 42:34.400
Take cover, behind you!

43:23.760 --> 43:25.080
Fuck!

43:25.600 --> 43:26.520
Fuck!

43:59.360 --> 44:00.280
Moscow!

44:00.960 --> 44:01.920
Moscow!

45:03.960 --> 45:06.480
