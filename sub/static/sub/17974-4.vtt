Son, as a rite of passage,
you must now pick one

00:37.071 --> 00:39.972
of these disgusting
creatures to be yours.

00:39.974 --> 00:43.876
(laughs)
We're just like that
father and son on <i>Cathouse.</i>

00:43.878 --> 00:46.145
Uch. That show's only
worth watching

00:46.147 --> 00:49.815
when you're too tired
to get your computer.

00:49.817 --> 00:50.715
(gobbling)

00:50.817 --> 00:53.921
(voice breaks):
Oh! Sometimes I see so much
of your mother in you.

00:57.924 --> 00:59.992
(giggles)
I choose this one, Daddy.

00:59.994 --> 01:01.927
He put his pecker
in my mouth.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.929
Okay, okay.
Shoot it.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.998
What? I'm not shooting
this turkey!

01:06.000 --> 01:07.933
Killing innocent animals
is wrong.

01:07.935 --> 01:10.102
No animals are innocent.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.937
They're all
guilty of something.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.506
Besides, you eat turkey
all the time.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.108
That's turkey the food.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.876
This is turkey
the animal.

01:17.878 --> 01:20.512
Benjamin Franklin thought
turkeys were so noble,

01:20.514 --> 01:23.082
he suggested they be America's
national bird.

01:23.084 --> 01:26.118
Benjamin Franklin was
an atheist pedophile

01:26.120 --> 01:28.087
who flew kites
to meet children.

01:28.089 --> 01:30.089
That's why God struck
him with lightning.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.291
I won't do it! No!

01:32.293 --> 01:34.593
(gobbling)

01:37.197 --> 01:39.798
Mama! Mama! This is it!
Over here!

01:39.800 --> 01:41.967
Rallo, what is this
I let you wake me up

01:41.969 --> 01:43.469
and drive me
down here for?

01:43.471 --> 01:46.572
The Thanksgiving Day parade
float registration!

01:46.574 --> 01:48.540
Come on, Mama.
I've been talking about this

01:48.542 --> 01:52.211
since Febu... Febra...
since before March.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.979
Um, are y'all here
for the, um,

01:53.981 --> 01:56.081
Thanksgiving float
registration?

01:56.083 --> 01:58.484
Yeah, give us that clipboard,
you burnout.

01:58.486 --> 02:01.286
And forget everything you know
about floats.

02:01.288 --> 02:05.090
'Cause ours will be the Cadillac
of the 1970s of floats.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.725
It's gonna be
the kind of float

02:06.727 --> 02:08.627
that when it goes by,
people say,

02:08.629 --> 02:12.965
"Huh, look at that float.
Oh, here comes another one."

02:15.235 --> 02:17.803
Everyone's sitting
with turkeys,

02:17.805 --> 02:19.838
and I gave birth to one.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.473
Where is your embarrassment
of a son?

02:21.475 --> 02:25.244
He's probably at home taking
baths with lady products.

02:25.246 --> 02:29.114
But tomorrow, after I take
my bath with cinnamon essence,

02:29.116 --> 02:32.117
I am going to take him
to kill a turkey!

02:32.119 --> 02:35.954
Yours are a fragrant
and fascinating people.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.422
Thank you.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.825
Oh, Cleveland,
those curly fries

02:39.827 --> 02:43.128
are for fathers and sons
who are bonding, so...

02:43.130 --> 02:46.198
Oh, these?
No one gets them!

02:46.200 --> 02:48.300
And I call
you can't order any more!

02:48.302 --> 02:50.435
Gus, You'll give us
more, right?!

02:50.437 --> 02:52.538
Sorry, fellas, it's been called.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.674
Alfredo, no <i>mas</i> curly fries!

02:55.676 --> 02:56.708
<i>¿Por que?</i>

02:56.710 --> 02:59.511
<i>Por que</i> Cleveland called it.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.712
That's <i>por que!</i>

03:00.714 --> 03:03.115
Okay, Dick.

03:04.717 --> 03:08.153
Mama, I finished my design
for our float.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.821
It's a turkey.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.558
And that's the sun.
Why is he smiling?

03:12.560 --> 03:15.194
Perhaps it's the good-lookin'
turkey float.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.628
Mm-hmm. That's great, Rallo.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.231
You think we can knock this
out in time for Judge Mathis?

03:19.233 --> 03:21.233
It's a good one
about a lawnmower.

03:21.235 --> 03:24.136
Hi, Donna.
A little turd told me

03:24.138 --> 03:27.206
that you're competing in
the float contest this year.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.208
Rallo was the turd.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.409
It's a contest?!

03:30.411 --> 03:33.312
Rallo, you didn't tell me that,
you little turd!

03:33.314 --> 03:34.880
Don't get too excited.

03:34.882 --> 03:39.851
The same bitch has won
the contest for ten years: me.

03:39.853 --> 03:40.651
(laughs)

03:40.653 --> 03:42.988
RAYMOND:
There's a boat chasing us!

03:43.090 --> 03:44.188
Listen up, Rallo.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.892
I am not about to lose
to Miss Teddy Suxpin over there.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.327
A'ight.

03:50.496 --> 03:52.064
I can't believe
we're going

03:52.066 --> 03:53.765
to the Pillsbury
Doughboy's house!

03:53.767 --> 03:56.101
I can't believe
you believe it either.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.704
Was that a gun?

03:58.706 --> 04:01.206
Hmm? Oh, no, I'm not
about to trick you

04:01.208 --> 04:02.274
into shooting a turkey.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.776
You know,
it's a long trip.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.578
Why don't you put
your seat back,

04:06.580 --> 04:09.581
take a nap, and I'll wake
you up when we get there?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.350
I'm too excited to sleep.

04:11.352 --> 04:14.119
Nonsense.
Catch some Zs for Pa-pa?

04:14.121 --> 04:17.222
Here's a blanket,
Larry the Leopard,

04:17.224 --> 04:20.359
a eye pillow,
and this.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.195
Good night.
(snores)

04:23.197 --> 04:26.298
(whimpers)

04:26.300 --> 04:27.366
What the...?!

04:27.368 --> 04:29.568
Where's the
Pillsbury Doughboy?!

04:29.570 --> 04:32.037
Dead, Junior!
The turkeys did it!

04:32.039 --> 04:34.473
In cold gobbly blood!

04:34.475 --> 04:37.542
His last words were,
"Avenge me, Junior!"

04:37.544 --> 04:39.311
Then he poked himself
in the stomach,

04:39.313 --> 04:40.812
giggled, and died.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.481
Kill 'em!
Kill 'em all!

04:42.483 --> 04:44.616
You sons of bitches!

04:44.618 --> 04:46.051
Wait a minute.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.819
This isn't the
Doughboy residence!

04:47.821 --> 04:49.388
You tricked me!

04:49.390 --> 04:52.424
I will not murder with you!
(grunts)

04:52.426 --> 04:55.761
Why can't you just be more
like the D.C. Sniper's son?

04:55.763 --> 04:58.630
Stop comparing me
to Lee Boyd Malvo!

04:58.632 --> 04:59.965
I'm not him!

04:59.967 --> 05:02.301
Fine. I'll do it.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.502
(turkey gobbles)

05:05.238 --> 05:07.139
Please, Dad,
don't do this!

05:07.141 --> 05:10.142
I'm gonna put a duck
in your butt.

05:10.144 --> 05:14.179
And then I'm gonna put a
chicken in the duck's butt.

05:14.181 --> 05:19.351
(screaming)

05:19.652 --> 05:21.353
Ow!

05:21.355 --> 05:22.187
Oh.

05:22.189 --> 05:26.358
I... suspect... fowl... play.

05:28.361 --> 05:31.763
I can live with that being
my final joke ever. (grunts)

05:38.971 --> 05:41.206
Doctor, you can stop lighting
matches under his elbow.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.207
He's awake.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.308
Aw.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.943
Am I dead?

05:44.945 --> 05:48.213
No, Mr. Brown,
you're very much alive.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.849
Luckily, your many
layers of stomach fat

05:50.851 --> 05:52.684
slowed the bullet
before it finally lodged

05:52.686 --> 05:54.853
in the part of your liver
that's already dead.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.889
If you were shot three or four
inches to either side,

05:57.891 --> 06:00.325
you would have still been
shot in the fat.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.828
(all laugh)

06:02.830 --> 06:04.730
(grunting)

06:07.467 --> 06:08.734
Ta-da!

06:08.736 --> 06:10.402
Junior, you were right.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.338
Now I know what it feels like
to be hunted and shot.

06:13.340 --> 06:17.042
Those poor gobblers.
Killing turkeys is wrong!

06:17.044 --> 06:19.745
Except in cases
of rape and incest.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.247
We need to stop this!
Let's go, Junior!

06:26.652 --> 06:28.987
Aw, yeah, watch out, Arianna!

06:28.989 --> 06:32.057
Someone's making a quaint
and homespun float ovah heah!

06:32.059 --> 06:33.992
Well, if you like it now,

06:33.994 --> 06:37.996
you're gonna love it with some
fluorescent pink splatter paint!

06:37.998 --> 06:42.601
Ah, oh, okay,
a pink turkey, sure.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.036
I know! My poo cray!

06:45.038 --> 06:47.572
Here come the googly eyes!

06:47.574 --> 06:48.707
Googly eyes?

06:48.709 --> 06:50.609
You trying
to make a fool of Donna?!

06:50.611 --> 06:52.244
I mean, what fun.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.380
I know! And I got some
bubble wrap to throw on it.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.048
Ooh, and you know what else
would be cool?

06:57.050 --> 07:02.087
A book of your stamps.
And macaroni...!

07:04.924 --> 07:08.360
Oh, Donna, your float
is inferior to mine.

07:08.362 --> 07:11.096
(chuckles) Burn!

07:11.098 --> 07:13.932
Well, what she doesn't know
is I've got the last word

07:13.934 --> 07:17.202
in taste and design, and I'm
about to pull out the big gun!

07:17.204 --> 07:18.770
Tim Gunn!

07:18.772 --> 07:21.907
Donna, your float
makes me want to vomit.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.475
Which in the
fashion industry is

07:23.477 --> 07:25.143
like a standing ovation.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.745
So I'm a little
torn here.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.146
Make it work.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.916
Bitch, <i>you</i> make it work.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.385
I also say "wow factor."

07:33.387 --> 07:34.586
CLEVELAND:
What do we want?!

07:34.588 --> 07:36.087
To stop killing
turkeys!

07:36.089 --> 07:37.722
When do we want it?!

07:37.724 --> 07:39.758
We haven't really
talked about it yet!

07:39.760 --> 07:42.127
Well, when are you
free to discuss it?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.829
What's your Tuesday like?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.564
Tennis lessons!

07:45.566 --> 07:48.133
Honey, move along.
They're insane.

07:48.135 --> 07:51.069
♪

08:13.092 --> 08:16.862
Gentlemen, I have
two words for you:

08:16.864 --> 08:19.531
Can you... Dig it?

08:19.533 --> 08:21.766
What? No!
This isn't my float!

08:21.768 --> 08:23.535
I don't understand.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.636
Hi, boys.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.772
Aw, I was hoping to
surprise you, Rallo.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.674
Isn't she
magnificent?

08:29.676 --> 08:33.778
But... what about my ideas?
What about the googly eyes?!

08:33.780 --> 08:35.714
Oh, I loved
all your ideas!

08:35.716 --> 08:38.650
So much so that
I took them one step further

08:38.652 --> 08:42.153
and thought, "What if the float
didn't have googly eyes?"

08:42.155 --> 08:43.688
Then I ran with that.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.190
Say what?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.158
Now you can finally get
the revenge

08:47.160 --> 08:51.129
you've always wanted
against Arianna.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.465
Fellas, when's
the last time y'all went

08:53.467 --> 08:55.667
totally ballistic
on a big bird?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.369
It's been a minute.

08:58.170 --> 09:01.139
Yeah, yeah!

09:01.141 --> 09:03.208
(boys ululating)

09:03.210 --> 09:05.744
Junior, my feet hurt.
I'm tired.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.579
Are we even making
a difference?

09:07.581 --> 09:11.182
I mean, has a protest
ever really effected change?

09:11.184 --> 09:13.084
A little history
lesson, Dad.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.254
In 2007, as President Bush
was preparing

09:16.256 --> 09:19.057
to send another 20,000
brave American soldiers

09:19.059 --> 09:22.427
to fight and probably die in
an unpopular and unwinnable war,

09:22.429 --> 09:24.763
protesters like you
and me stood up

09:24.765 --> 09:29.034
for what they believed in and
sent 20 tons of peanuts to CBS

09:29.036 --> 09:31.603
to get <i>Jericho</i>
<i>back on the air.</i>

09:31.605 --> 09:32.771
Did it work?

09:32.773 --> 09:34.706
Did it work?
Why don't you ask

09:34.708 --> 09:38.410
the seven additional episodes
CBS ordered?

09:38.412 --> 09:40.779
You idiots have been
so annoying that

09:40.781 --> 09:42.714
folks hate turkeys
more than ever.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.215
Business is a-boomin'!

09:44.217 --> 09:48.286
In fact, all 27 remaining
turkeys are scheduled

09:48.288 --> 09:52.023
to be hunted down
tomorrow. (laughs)

09:52.025 --> 09:54.693
Oh, my God! How sad.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.097
(applause)

10:04.203 --> 10:05.937
(cheering and applause)

10:08.808 --> 10:11.209
(scattered applause)

10:12.445 --> 10:15.280
No in memumoriam!
We must save Fred!

10:15.282 --> 10:17.449
And Alex! And Marvin!

10:17.451 --> 10:19.884
And Jeff Conaway!

10:19.886 --> 10:21.620
Are those
really the turkeys' names?

10:21.622 --> 10:23.188
I didn't see
whatever you saw.

10:28.394 --> 10:31.429
Okay, we'll break out the
turkeys tonight and hide them.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.665
Then, tomorrow
when everyone's at the parade,

10:33.667 --> 10:36.234
we'll take them to the
Goochland Turkey Preserve.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.902
You and I would
make good cats.

10:37.904 --> 10:41.673
Stay focused,
but I do agree with you.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.908
Meow, meow.

10:59.458 --> 11:00.825
Damn it!

11:12.538 --> 11:15.206
Whew.

11:19.545 --> 11:21.179
Hello, friend.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.847
When you shot me,

11:22.849 --> 11:25.517
you saved my life.

11:25.519 --> 11:28.186
And now I shall
return the favor.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.990
Freedom!

11:31.992 --> 11:34.526
Shut the (bleep) up, man!

11:34.528 --> 11:35.526
You're right.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.997
Let's stick to the plan and get
these guys to the safe house.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.032
And make sure Lester
doesn't see us

11:41.034 --> 11:43.068
or else he'll kill us
in the faces.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.405
Oh! Round 'em up, Junior.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.674
But how are we going
to get them to follow us?

11:49.676 --> 11:52.143
You just leave that to you.

11:54.013 --> 11:56.648
(gobbling)

11:56.650 --> 11:58.049
Our garage.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.752
(gobbling)

12:00.754 --> 12:02.987
Underground Railroad.

12:02.989 --> 12:05.323
(gobbling)

12:12.098 --> 12:13.765
We're coming.

12:16.669 --> 12:19.137
(Cleveland Jr. gobbles)

12:23.509 --> 12:25.243
(gobbling)

12:25.245 --> 12:26.945
(whispering):
Shh. Be quiet.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.581
Mr. Barkington's
sleeping on the porch.

12:39.558 --> 12:40.892
Hey!

12:40.894 --> 12:43.895
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

12:43.897 --> 12:45.196
Hey! Hey!

12:50.970 --> 12:52.303
Password?

12:52.305 --> 12:55.473
Knock-knock-a-roonie-doonie.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.009
Exact-a-rooonie-boonie!

12:59.145 --> 13:01.546
(gobbling)

13:09.455 --> 13:10.655
Hello!

13:10.657 --> 13:12.590
Whoa!

13:12.592 --> 13:13.725
Let's go!

13:15.060 --> 13:17.362
(gobbling)

13:26.105 --> 13:28.473
Safe at last.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.575
Keep these suckers
in here for the night.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.911
Y'all lay low in here
for a little while.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.479
I'll come back
with some pizzas.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.481
Y'all fine with Papa John?

13:36.483 --> 13:38.116
You know what?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.318
We're bringing them peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.688
Them dumb birds...
don't know the difference.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.794
Ooh...

13:49.796 --> 13:53.565
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

13:58.437 --> 14:00.839
How are we gonna
sneak out those birds?

14:03.008 --> 14:05.443
I just got an idea...

14:05.445 --> 14:07.178
and lost it,
and now it's back...

14:07.180 --> 14:09.547
and I should write it down
before I forget again...

14:09.549 --> 14:11.516
Damn it. What was it?
Give me a second...

14:11.518 --> 14:14.018
Got it! Wait, lost it...

14:14.020 --> 14:15.687
A-ha!

14:16.889 --> 14:19.524
Rallo! It's almost time
for the parade

14:19.526 --> 14:21.626
and our float's been
completely trashed!

14:21.628 --> 14:22.861
We're screwed!

14:22.863 --> 14:24.829
Oh, yeah, yeah, I trashed it.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.130
(gasps)

14:26.132 --> 14:27.999
Because you trashed my dream

14:28.001 --> 14:30.702
of making a float with my
mother's love and support!

14:30.704 --> 14:34.305
Oh, Rallo, what have I done?

14:34.307 --> 14:36.207
I know! I'm your son!

14:36.209 --> 14:38.643
That should be more important
than any old contest!

14:38.645 --> 14:40.044
No!

14:40.046 --> 14:42.013
I mean,
I set Arianna's float on fire!

14:42.015 --> 14:45.149
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.051
I never should
have let you down.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.519
I'm going to run
to the store

14:48.521 --> 14:50.655
and buy all the
googly eyes they have!

14:51.690 --> 14:54.292
Oh, the bear-manity!

15:02.935 --> 15:04.669
Hello, Cleveland.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.105
Did you hear somebody stole
all my turkeys last night?

15:07.107 --> 15:09.674
No. How are you?

15:09.676 --> 15:10.842
Fine.

15:10.844 --> 15:13.011
Midmorning's kind of
a funny time

15:13.013 --> 15:15.380
to be hanging out
near your garage.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.616
Lester, you need to relax
and enjoy Thanksgiving,

15:18.618 --> 15:22.320
because the holidays
go by in a... flash!

15:23.789 --> 15:25.757
Well, I'll be.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.725
I didn't know you were
a flasher, too?

15:27.727 --> 15:30.228
Yeah, I'm trying
to get back into it.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.796
(whispering)
Now! Hurry!

15:31.798 --> 15:35.233
So, Les... you've done
some flashing yourself, huh?

15:35.235 --> 15:36.567
I dabble.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.769
Weddings and
bar mitzvahs, mostly.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.737
Just a little
constructive criticism...

15:39.739 --> 15:43.141
your lengthy flash is
appreciated, but not necessary.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.710
You really just want
to give the people a taste.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.612
That's why they
call it a "flash."

15:47.614 --> 15:54.619
Oh...

15:54.621 --> 15:56.421
...kay.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.755
Welp, me and the boy

15:57.757 --> 15:59.891
better get our float
over to the parade.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.759
Oh, well have fun!

16:01.761 --> 16:02.727
Happy Thanksgiving!

16:02.729 --> 16:04.329
I'll kill ya
if you stole my birds!

16:04.331 --> 16:07.332
Never imagined
he'd have gone gray down there.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.867
Reminds me of when I saw
Bill Russell at that urinal.

16:11.303 --> 16:14.672
(gasps)
Mama double-crossed me!

16:14.674 --> 16:16.341
She's taking my float
to the parade

16:16.343 --> 16:18.743
without me or my googly eyes!

16:22.648 --> 16:26.484
Mama, you're a dead man!

16:27.753 --> 16:29.087
Damn it, Walt!

16:29.089 --> 16:30.421
If you gonna borrow
my Big Wheel,

16:30.423 --> 16:32.190
fill it up before
you bring it back!

16:37.129 --> 16:39.364
Kendra!

16:39.366 --> 16:41.099
CLEVELAND:
<i>We did it, Junior!</i>

16:41.101 --> 16:43.668
We saved 27 turkeys.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.937
Uh-oh.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.341
See?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.710
That explains why
I said "uh-oh."

16:52.712 --> 16:54.012
Uh-oh.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.513
(sniffing)

16:55.515 --> 16:57.015
Yeah.

16:57.816 --> 17:00.084
♪

17:01.186 --> 17:02.687
(tires screech)

17:03.889 --> 17:05.189
Great float!

17:05.191 --> 17:07.258
Go on through.

17:10.796 --> 17:13.531
Damn, people be tall.

17:16.402 --> 17:17.902
(grunts)
Hey!

17:31.216 --> 17:33.885
Whoa, I'm higher
than Woody Harrelson

17:33.887 --> 17:35.653
listening to
<i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>

17:35.655 --> 17:38.890
at Matthew McConaughey's
beach house!

17:38.892 --> 17:41.759
Right in the middle
of these two.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.227
That's where we want to be.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.862
DONNA:
Thanks!

17:44.864 --> 17:46.564
I love your store, Michael.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.266
Come back soon!

17:48.268 --> 17:49.567
And Donna?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.736
You're doing the right
thing for Rallo.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.737
I know.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.872
I really am a great mom.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.041
With a great ass!

17:57.043 --> 17:59.610
Michael...

18:02.748 --> 18:04.682
My baby!

18:08.854 --> 18:10.788
All right, you two,
give me the birds!

18:10.790 --> 18:12.824
Nevah!

18:19.031 --> 18:20.398
(gobbling)

18:20.400 --> 18:22.433
(cheering)

18:25.604 --> 18:27.972
Fine, I'll just kill 'em myself.

18:27.974 --> 18:30.475
Lester's Turkey Hunt is back on!

18:30.477 --> 18:32.443
(gunshot)

18:35.781 --> 18:37.081
Rallo!

18:37.083 --> 18:38.816
I'm here, baby! Don't move!

18:38.818 --> 18:40.084
Mama?

18:40.086 --> 18:42.386
Oh, Mama.
You brought the googly eyes!

18:42.388 --> 18:45.490
You do love me
more than a parade float!

18:45.492 --> 18:48.259
(turkeys gobbling)

18:48.261 --> 18:50.862
(screaming)

18:52.231 --> 18:54.265
My baby! My baby!

18:54.267 --> 18:55.600
Ma'am, there's
no need to panic.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.034
Those power lines
will stop him.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.305
(gasps)

19:01.307 --> 19:02.940
(grunting)
Cleveland!

19:02.942 --> 19:03.975
Help!

19:03.977 --> 19:05.943
(yells)
(gasps)

19:05.945 --> 19:07.411
Is that the little kid
from upstairs?

19:21.760 --> 19:25.029
That balloon is outrageous!

19:25.031 --> 19:26.564
(farting)

19:27.099 --> 19:28.166
(screams)

19:28.168 --> 19:29.534
Ya happy?

19:29.536 --> 19:31.035
Rallo's gonna die

19:31.037 --> 19:33.304
because you had to save
those stupid turkeys.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.006
They are not stupid!

19:35.707 --> 19:37.108
Ah!

19:38.110 --> 19:39.443
(gobbling)

19:39.445 --> 19:41.712
(screaming)

19:41.714 --> 19:43.247
(gasping)

19:44.016 --> 19:46.450
(gobbling)

19:46.452 --> 19:48.052
Ah...

19:50.055 --> 19:51.455
Y'all see that?

19:51.457 --> 19:53.124
That poo cray!

19:53.126 --> 19:55.126
(cheering)

19:57.563 --> 19:59.030
Every year we have
this (bleep) tradition

19:59.032 --> 20:00.731
to pardon a (bleep) turkey.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.201
This year, I'm pardoning
these 27 (bleep)

20:03.203 --> 20:04.969
for saving this
little (bleep) life.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.537
(cheering)

20:08.006 --> 20:10.908
We won the float contest!

20:11.877 --> 20:14.045
Well, we did it, Daddy.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.013
We saved some turkeys.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.648
We sure did.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.984
And son, I don't
tell you this enough,

20:19.986 --> 20:23.387
but you're a good,
fat little person.

20:23.389 --> 20:26.057
Hey, let's not go through
the same thing

20:26.059 --> 20:27.825
over our Christmas ham.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.994
Oh, don't worry.
I'll kill a pig.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.396
Strangle it with my bare hands.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.599
Watch the life
drain from its eyes.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.034
Mm-hmm.
Eat the sucker
for dinner that night.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.004
Tail, gristle, teeth, all of it.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.373
(laughing):
All right.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.908
I'd also like
to kill a person.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.410
What?
I could get away
with it too.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.012
Get on a bus,
pay with cash,

20:48.014 --> 20:49.914
kill him where
nobody could hear,

20:49.916 --> 20:51.015
hop back on the bus.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.583
They'd never catch me,

20:52.585 --> 20:55.186
as long as nobody went
flapping their lips about it.

20:55.188 --> 20:58.256
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!
