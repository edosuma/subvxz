Original Story by Ju ho-min

01:17.667 --> 01:20.768
When a person reaches
the afterlife,

01:20.792 --> 01:25.143
one is judged 7 times
over the course of 49 days.

01:25.167 --> 01:31.184
Tried by deceit, indolence, injustice
betrayal, violence, murder, filial impiety,

01:31.208 --> 01:35.851
only the souls who pass
all trials are reincarnated.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.000
Kim!

03:05.292 --> 03:06.292
Take my hand!

03:06.833 --> 03:08.417
Give me the kid!
Grab my hand!

03:09.417 --> 03:10.417
Come on!

03:10.875 --> 03:11.875
Reach out your hand!

03:13.625 --> 03:14.625
Hurry!

03:15.625 --> 03:17.125
The rope!
It's on fire!

03:17.875 --> 03:18.875
Take my hand!

03:19.292 --> 03:19.976
No!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.125
Ja-hong! No!

03:41.625 --> 03:42.875
We made it, we're alive.

03:43.208 --> 03:44.542
It's okay, sweetie.

03:45.042 --> 03:46.042
Mom!

03:47.167 --> 03:48.167
Mom!

03:50.792 --> 03:52.667
Hey! Get over here!

03:57.667 --> 03:58.958
That was close!

03:59.875 --> 04:01.250
That could've ended badly!

04:02.167 --> 04:04.750
Little lady, what's your name?

04:05.292 --> 04:06.292
Kim Ja-hong!

04:06.833 --> 04:08.643
That's my name, cutie.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.625
How did you know my name?

04:11.083 --> 04:12.333
What's yours?

04:13.333 --> 04:14.333
Your name...

04:14.958 --> 04:16.416
Kim Ja-hong!

04:19.375 --> 04:20.541
Kim Ja-hong!

05:02.250 --> 05:03.500
You there!

05:03.833 --> 05:06.333
Get out of there!
It's dangerous!

05:06.792 --> 05:08.875
Get a stretcher!
Hurry the hell up!

05:09.000 --> 05:10.167
Ja-hong!

05:10.417 --> 05:11.393
Mr. Kim Ja-hong!

05:11.417 --> 05:12.417
Wow!

05:13.833 --> 05:17.768
How the hell did you think
to jump from there?

05:17.792 --> 05:21.708
You fell from such height,
and honorably saved a girl...

05:22.542 --> 05:24.059
A paragon!

05:24.083 --> 05:27.167
The last honorable death
was 422 years ago.

05:27.583 --> 05:29.000
I am honored,
Mr. Kim Ja-hong!

05:29.458 --> 05:31.792
The last one was Nongae in 1592.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.333
He's a paragon?

05:36.042 --> 05:41.268
You passed away on
April 28, 2017 as scheduled.

05:41.292 --> 05:44.434
We are 3 guardians
of the afterlife,

05:44.458 --> 05:49.083
who will defend you
through 7 trials over 49 days.

05:49.875 --> 05:52.375
I'm a security specialist
Deputy Guardian Hewonmak.

05:53.833 --> 05:56.518
I am Assistant Guardian
Deok-choon.

05:56.542 --> 05:57.684
Good to meet you!

05:57.708 --> 05:59.125
It's an honor, sir!

06:01.125 --> 06:03.768
We said 3 guardians,
so why just 2?

06:03.792 --> 06:05.393
It's an obvious question.

06:05.417 --> 06:06.833
The last guardian is...

06:07.083 --> 06:08.833
At your funeral home.

06:09.333 --> 06:12.934
It's a protocol,
but I think he went for food.

06:12.958 --> 06:14.458
He's a strange one,
don't you think?

06:14.958 --> 06:17.476
Mr. Kim?
What's up?

06:17.500 --> 06:21.143
Everything's fine,
you're a death virgin.

06:21.167 --> 06:23.792
That's why it's confusing
and awkward.

06:24.750 --> 06:25.750
No...

06:26.958 --> 06:28.542
I can't die just yet.

06:29.042 --> 06:30.042
My mother...

06:31.417 --> 06:33.000
I can't leave my mother!

06:33.500 --> 06:35.434
Afterlife law, article 3.1!

06:35.458 --> 06:39.684
One can't wander the living world,
and no time for farewells!

06:39.708 --> 06:43.809
If you plead the fifth,
you'll be in a disadvantage...

06:43.833 --> 06:46.768
He's following the protocol
like a real paragon.

06:46.792 --> 06:48.434
Good, keep going!

06:48.458 --> 06:51.875
Up! Up!

06:53.125 --> 06:56.434
Then let me see my mother
one last time, please!

06:56.458 --> 06:57.976
I have something to tell her!

06:58.000 --> 06:59.976
Love for his mother...

07:00.000 --> 07:01.417
Please, I'm begging you!

07:04.000 --> 07:05.292
One last time!

07:06.708 --> 07:07.958
Please!

07:32.792 --> 07:34.167
This is bad even for me.

07:42.208 --> 07:45.458
Casketing for Kim Ja-hong
will begin shortly.

07:46.167 --> 07:51.292
Once again, casketing for
Kim Ja-hong will begin shortly.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.125
Mom.

07:55.292 --> 07:56.292
Mom?

07:58.125 --> 08:00.125
Snap out of it, Mom.

08:02.208 --> 08:04.083
He's ready, let's go.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.792
Mom, we should go!

08:31.250 --> 08:34.625
Gate of Afterlife

08:42.250 --> 08:43.250
Salute!

08:43.832 --> 08:45.851
That's King Yeomra.

08:45.875 --> 08:48.458
The judge of Filial Impiety Hell,
and the king of kings.

08:49.125 --> 08:52.101
And he's guardian gang-hm.

08:52.125 --> 08:54.559
The leader and our boss.

08:54.583 --> 08:58.958
He reincarnated 47 souls
in the past century.

08:59.458 --> 09:02.292
Paragon Kim, good to meet you.
Make way for a paragon!

09:04.083 --> 09:05.333
I'm not a paragon.

09:08.292 --> 09:09.292
Over here!

09:09.708 --> 09:10.684
Here! Here!

09:10.708 --> 09:12.393
Let him through.
Make way.

09:12.417 --> 09:14.458
Mr. Kim, please hurry!
Make way.

09:20.042 --> 09:22.042
Kim Ja-hong

09:33.125 --> 09:35.125
Incredible! He's the one!

09:37.083 --> 09:40.333
Mr. Kim, you really are
an honorable paragon!

09:40.792 --> 09:42.393
It's been 19 years!

09:42.417 --> 09:46.809
Your chance of reincarnation
after 49 days is very high!

09:46.833 --> 09:49.417
An honorable soul!
Paragon Kim Ja-hong!

10:05.208 --> 10:06.957
Volcano of the damned

10:06.958 --> 10:08.582
volcano of the damned why the hell
is murder hell our first stop?

10:08.583 --> 10:09.542
Why the hell is
murder hell our first stop?

10:11.167 --> 10:13.143
Murder hell! The volcano!

10:13.167 --> 10:15.768
You said he's a paragon.

10:15.792 --> 10:18.375
Did you really kill someone?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
What?

10:21.292 --> 10:23.167
I didn't kill anyone.

10:23.792 --> 10:26.976
There are a total of 7 trials...

10:27.000 --> 10:30.143
Betrayal, violence, filial impiety,
murder, indolence, deceit, injustice.

10:30.167 --> 10:33.893
King Yeomra assigns
the trial order

10:33.917 --> 10:37.208
starting from a light sin
to a heavy sin.

10:38.792 --> 10:40.309
Other than Yeomra,

10:40.333 --> 10:43.250
no one knows the order
of your trials.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.726
Murder? I've never
harmed anyone.

10:46.750 --> 10:49.476
This trial will also
look at indirect murders.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.684
If your past actions
influenced someone's death,

10:52.708 --> 10:55.083
that is enough cause
to be charged.

10:55.375 --> 10:57.976
So don't post mean
comments online hastily!

10:58.000 --> 10:59.143
It's all recorded!

10:59.167 --> 11:01.667
No need to worry,
guess what she's doing.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.976
Our baby has a special power.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.018
She's scanning
a list of all your charges,

11:09.042 --> 11:12.143
to better defend you.

11:12.167 --> 11:14.601
It may seem like a skill
but it's like Karma.

11:14.625 --> 11:15.792
It must be taxing on her.

11:16.458 --> 11:17.458
Who did he kill?

11:46.750 --> 11:47.750
No!

11:50.625 --> 11:51.875
Sir!

11:58.667 --> 12:02.250
Murder Hell

12:17.458 --> 12:18.458
Give me your hand!

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Just a little more!

12:22.208 --> 12:23.125
I got you!

12:23.958 --> 12:24.809
Climb!

12:24.833 --> 12:26.792
You insolent prick!

12:27.000 --> 12:29.042
How dare you!

12:36.958 --> 12:39.458
God of Murder

12:49.167 --> 12:54.851
This trial is about leaving
a doomed colleague behind

12:54.875 --> 12:57.309
despite having enough time,

12:57.333 --> 13:00.934
Kim's desire for his own safety
and indecisiveness

13:00.958 --> 13:04.417
caused his colleague's death.

13:08.833 --> 13:14.018
If he acted in time,
the victim could've survived,

13:14.042 --> 13:19.375
therefore, this could be
seen as an indirect murder!

13:25.625 --> 13:29.601
This indirect murder was

13:29.625 --> 13:33.143
a direct result of
his willful negligence,

13:33.167 --> 13:37.684
and he must suffer
in the volcano

13:37.708 --> 13:39.000
for 50 years...

13:40.333 --> 13:41.184
5 years!

13:41.208 --> 13:43.292
You can't demand
50 years from a paragon!

13:44.208 --> 13:46.101
He's a paragon!

13:46.125 --> 13:48.208
Be respectful with your demands!

13:49.500 --> 13:51.333
We demand a punishment

13:52.500 --> 13:55.809
of 5 years that feels like 50!

13:55.833 --> 13:57.958
Because he's a paragon!

14:02.000 --> 14:04.458
Guardians, begin your defense!

14:08.500 --> 14:10.625
I'd like to first ask the defendant.

14:11.667 --> 14:15.292
Do you remember your
colleague's last words?

14:21.708 --> 14:22.708
Hello?!

14:24.542 --> 14:25.684
Listen.
Help!

14:25.708 --> 14:26.976
Help the injured first.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.768
It'll be safer
if you control the fire.

14:29.792 --> 14:33.434
Puncture the outer wall
and lift this with a pulley.

14:33.458 --> 14:34.458
Got it?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.708
It might cave in, get going!

14:39.375 --> 14:40.375
Get out!

14:41.000 --> 14:41.643
Go on!

14:41.667 --> 14:44.268
I'll be back shortly.

14:44.292 --> 14:45.351
Stay right here!

14:45.375 --> 14:47.851
That's all I can do.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.625
I'll be right here.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.542
Here, take this.

14:58.542 --> 14:59.667
You'll need it!

15:03.625 --> 15:05.083
Go! Go on!

15:11.958 --> 15:14.375
Kim Ja-hong, raise your head.

15:15.625 --> 15:16.792
You're not guilty yet.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.667
Raise your head, Mr. Kim.

15:25.375 --> 15:26.875
One more question.

15:27.708 --> 15:30.059
During the fire that day,

15:30.083 --> 15:35.059
you followed his order
and couldn't save him,

15:35.083 --> 15:37.125
but how many others
have you saved?

15:40.458 --> 15:41.500
6...

15:42.958 --> 15:43.958
7?

15:45.125 --> 15:49.000
I'm not sure,
I can't remember...

15:53.167 --> 15:54.917
Please pay attention
to the mirror of Karma.

16:00.625 --> 16:01.750
May I borrow this?

16:10.458 --> 16:11.934
As you can see,

16:11.958 --> 16:16.726
his memory may be foggy,
but he saved exactly 8 lives

16:16.750 --> 16:19.476
from the vicious inferno.

16:19.500 --> 16:23.125
He was on the nightly news
for his heroism.

16:24.167 --> 16:26.809
Let me ask you this.

16:26.833 --> 16:30.393
The defendant saved
8 total strangers,

16:30.417 --> 16:34.708
but in doing so,
he couldn't save his colleague.

16:35.458 --> 16:38.684
Then how are these lives
weighed differently?

16:38.708 --> 16:40.125
I await your answer.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.333
Such nonsense
on the first trial?

16:48.667 --> 16:52.934
How do you weigh lives?
They're not even tangible.

16:52.958 --> 16:57.250
If something invisible
has weight, they're all the same...

17:08.708 --> 17:10.083
Honorable god of murder,

17:10.625 --> 17:16.226
please take into consideration
the prosecutor's last statement,

17:16.250 --> 17:21.625
as you weigh in on
honorable Kim's charges.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.309
It's too dangerous!
Get back!

17:29.333 --> 17:31.101
Don't go!

17:31.125 --> 17:33.042
No! No!

17:37.292 --> 17:38.625
My daughter...

17:40.833 --> 17:43.625
Ji-yeon, my baby!

18:11.250 --> 18:13.125
Here is my final verdict!

18:14.125 --> 18:17.559
The defendant's decision

18:17.583 --> 18:23.101
to save many lives instead of
his colleague is paradoxical,

18:23.125 --> 18:27.601
but his death breathed
life to many!

18:27.625 --> 18:32.059
His indirect murder charge
is rejected.

18:32.083 --> 18:37.809
This court finds
honorable Kim innocent,

18:37.833 --> 18:42.042
as his murder charge
is completely without merit.

18:42.167 --> 18:45.792
River of Indolence

18:53.583 --> 18:54.583
Mr. Kim.

18:54.917 --> 19:00.542
The next trial determines
how well you lived your life.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.851
Whether you lived it to the fullest...

19:02.875 --> 19:03.875
Guardian Gang-lim!

19:06.542 --> 19:08.375
It's like we hit a jackpot!

19:08.583 --> 19:10.042
Finished scanning already?

19:13.458 --> 19:16.018
There is no arraignment at all,

19:16.042 --> 19:20.809
and he just has to step in
and say how hard he lived.

19:20.833 --> 19:24.934
We were even assigned
the shittiest prosecutors.

19:24.958 --> 19:26.917
To ensure Kim's smooth ride.

19:28.583 --> 19:30.500
Do not underestimate
the prosecutors.

19:31.125 --> 19:34.309
Starting off with a loss,
they'll be armed to the teeth.

19:34.333 --> 19:37.934
If they indict a paragon,
they'll get promoted.

19:37.958 --> 19:39.833
What's in it for you all?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.500
Why are you trying to
save someone like me?

19:46.833 --> 19:50.059
Don't be so cynical.

19:50.083 --> 19:51.851
Reincarnation is good for you.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.184
But I don't want
to be reincarnated.

19:53.208 --> 19:55.851
Mr. Kim, that's for
the afterlife to decide.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.292
It's a century-old promise.

20:03.167 --> 20:05.042
A promise with King Yeomra.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.809
If we help reincarnate
49 souls over a century,

20:08.833 --> 20:10.976
he'll reincarnate us as well.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.434
As whatever we want!

20:12.458 --> 20:15.643
I already decided,
son of a fortune 500 CEO.

20:15.667 --> 20:18.333
Anything else is more hell
than hell in Korea.

20:23.292 --> 20:28.018
However, that's only possible
by defending paragons like you.

20:28.042 --> 20:33.851
For a normal soul to pass
all trials in 49 days

20:33.875 --> 20:36.559
is next to impossible.

20:36.583 --> 20:40.583
Be our 48th reincarnation,
I beg of you.

20:42.250 --> 20:43.917
What if I wasn't a paragon?

20:45.208 --> 20:46.750
What would you do then?

20:47.833 --> 20:51.333
Let me stress again,
that's for the afterlife to decide.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.601
Don't look at it!

21:13.625 --> 21:14.833
No eye contact!

21:15.208 --> 21:17.667
They see people's eyes
and prey on you.

21:17.833 --> 21:21.601
They come after
souls that look at them.

21:21.625 --> 21:22.625
They'll tear you up.

21:26.375 --> 21:27.375
Mr. Kim.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.476
Think of indolence hell
as a tourist stop,

21:32.500 --> 21:34.000
but remember one thing.

21:35.542 --> 21:40.375
Do not talk back to
goddess of indolence.

21:41.458 --> 21:42.875
No exceptions.

21:43.625 --> 21:44.875
Your feet.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.500
Grab it!

21:54.375 --> 21:55.375
There, grab it!

22:04.708 --> 22:08.624
Article 2.3,
definition of indolence is,

22:08.625 --> 22:09.000
indolence hell

22:09.001 --> 22:11.832
indolence hell wasting away a
noble life given to the subject

22:11.833 --> 22:13.792
wasting away a noble life
given to the subject

22:13.958 --> 22:18.583
with endless idling
and negligence.

22:19.292 --> 22:23.101
But as you see,
indolence and laziness

22:23.125 --> 22:25.809
are inconceivable
to Kim Ja-hong.

22:25.833 --> 22:29.499
I present you his life to you,
honorable goddess.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.707
Goddess of indolence I present you
his life to you, honorable goddess.

22:30.708 --> 22:32.500
Goddess of indolence

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
be careful!
Almost there!

22:37.625 --> 22:38.625
So close!

22:39.458 --> 22:42.684
Good! So close!
Grab it!

22:42.708 --> 22:43.708
Eh? Bee!

22:44.875 --> 22:45.875
Bee!

23:12.250 --> 23:17.726
His passion for saving lives

23:17.750 --> 23:21.625
wasn't limited to just humans!

23:29.500 --> 23:31.333
Amazing! Incredible!

23:31.792 --> 23:36.684
His affectionate gestures
reached out to

23:36.708 --> 23:40.292
even the smallest
and weakest organisms.

23:40.875 --> 23:44.351
Everything he touched,

23:44.375 --> 23:50.208
was filled with glimpses of
sacrifice and salvation.

23:50.458 --> 23:52.309
Don't look at me, look at Navi!

23:52.333 --> 23:54.768
She's over there, get her, now!

23:54.792 --> 23:57.042
Talk to her,
convince her to come.

23:57.792 --> 23:59.226
Oh gosh!

23:59.250 --> 24:03.601
His vocational ethics
that knows no boundaries

24:03.625 --> 24:09.917
often put him into
dangerous situations...

24:20.208 --> 24:21.208
Lamborghini!

24:22.042 --> 24:23.934
He's not at fault, Kim Ja-hong!

24:23.958 --> 24:26.018
We understand you, Kim Ja-hong!

24:26.042 --> 24:31.292
How could anyone
fault him for anything?

24:32.875 --> 24:33.875
Your honorable goddess.

24:34.458 --> 24:37.018
Those guardians,

24:37.042 --> 24:41.684
they're patronizing your court
by turning it into a show and tell.

24:41.708 --> 24:42.684
Hold him in contempt...

24:42.708 --> 24:43.309
Enough!

24:43.333 --> 24:44.833
Forget it, it's all settled.

24:49.333 --> 24:52.476
Let's erect his statue here.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.500
Raise it!

24:54.625 --> 24:57.292
If not for someone like him,
then who? Right?

24:57.917 --> 24:58.518
Let's erect one!

24:58.542 --> 25:00.000
Of course, your highness.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.042
While at it, a big one,
order an extra large statue.

25:05.667 --> 25:07.083
Good, something big.

25:16.167 --> 25:18.809
What compelled you

25:18.833 --> 25:21.625
to throw yourself in danger
to save others?

25:22.167 --> 25:29.375
Or did you want to live
each day to the fullest?

25:32.292 --> 25:33.542
It was all for money.

25:36.708 --> 25:37.708
Say what?

25:41.958 --> 25:43.250
Did I hear money?

25:44.125 --> 25:45.125
Cash?

25:46.167 --> 25:47.167
Money?

25:49.792 --> 25:52.768
Yes, I...

25:52.792 --> 25:53.684
Had to make money.

25:53.708 --> 25:54.708
Mr. Kim!

25:57.875 --> 25:58.875
Your highness,

25:59.375 --> 26:01.708
we'll start the lift.

26:02.250 --> 26:04.559
Sure, go on.

26:04.583 --> 26:05.583
Okay.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.042
Was money god to you?

26:10.625 --> 26:12.708
You served a terrible god.

26:15.458 --> 26:20.708
I'll make you feel sorry
for choosing the money god.

27:01.292 --> 27:03.250
Hewonmak!
Go save him!

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
He's gonna fall!

27:13.500 --> 27:14.500
Merciful goddess!

27:14.750 --> 27:16.792
I beg of you to look at
the mirror of Karma!

27:16.917 --> 27:18.500
What do you think you're doing?!

27:19.000 --> 27:21.083
He worshipped the wrong god!

27:21.833 --> 27:23.268
Yes, he did.

27:23.292 --> 27:25.809
And for that reason,

27:25.833 --> 27:29.250
he extinguished fire during the day
and light one at night.

27:29.833 --> 27:31.250
Get him charcoal fire!

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Sure!

27:35.042 --> 27:36.393
Watch out, fire coming through.

27:36.417 --> 27:38.893
Due to utter poverty,

27:38.917 --> 27:42.518
Kim delivered veggies
on his off days,

27:42.542 --> 27:44.893
and cleaned sauna floors
on the weekends,

27:44.917 --> 27:46.893
and when that was over,

27:46.917 --> 27:50.833
he was forced to work
as a temp driver.

28:00.708 --> 28:01.708
Ja-hong!

28:01.958 --> 28:03.750
You bastard!

28:04.250 --> 28:05.667
Drive straight!

28:11.625 --> 28:12.708
Even day offs?

28:13.417 --> 28:16.476
Then when did he get any rest?

28:16.500 --> 28:18.601
His true day off

28:18.625 --> 28:21.934
was the day after his death.

28:21.958 --> 28:26.458
He has not rested for
a moment when he was alive.

28:27.292 --> 28:29.768
His ailing mother
required treatment,

28:29.792 --> 28:34.042
and his brother's law school
wasn't cheap!

28:35.333 --> 28:39.708
Without Kim's money,
they wouldn't have survived!

28:40.958 --> 28:44.083
Money was everything to him!

28:46.125 --> 28:50.518
He was only able to sever
the reach of this god by dying!

28:50.542 --> 28:53.309
I beg of you to
embrace this soul,

28:53.333 --> 28:57.125
a soul that only looked after
his poverty-stricken family!

29:01.708 --> 29:02.708
Thank you.

29:02.917 --> 29:03.917
Good afternoon.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.958
My verdict is as follows.

29:13.500 --> 29:19.143
The defendant's reason for
not being indolent

29:19.167 --> 29:24.059
was said to be accumulation
of money and goods,

29:24.083 --> 29:28.726
which were not for
his own selfish interest,

29:28.750 --> 29:33.332
but to support his ailing mother
and his young brother,

29:33.333 --> 29:35.416
blade forest but to support his
ailing mother and his young brother,

29:35.417 --> 29:36.707
blade forest
I find the defendant not guilty.

29:36.708 --> 29:39.667
I find the defendant not guilty.

29:44.500 --> 29:49.268
Deceit hell judges the lies
one said in his life.

29:49.292 --> 29:52.476
Branches are razor sharp,
hence blade forest.

29:52.500 --> 29:55.000
The reflection of the moon
on the blades...

29:55.667 --> 29:57.726
Is quite beautiful, right?

29:57.750 --> 30:00.333
But if you touch anything
out of your curiosity...

30:01.708 --> 30:03.958
If you did out of curiosity,

30:10.333 --> 30:14.833
The blades will slice you open
and you'll feel incredible pain.

30:15.333 --> 30:18.083
I begged you not to
talk back at the goddess.

30:18.333 --> 30:19.875
You broke my promise again.

30:20.708 --> 30:23.184
I won't be making
any more of those.

30:23.208 --> 30:24.792
It'll be orders from here on.

30:27.792 --> 30:28.792
Free him!

30:29.042 --> 30:31.518
Why are you so rebellious?

30:31.542 --> 30:33.208
It'd be nice if you do
what you're told.

30:33.792 --> 30:38.250
We get a 48th paragon and
you get a reincarnation.

30:40.042 --> 30:43.851
And get a dream visitation
before reincarnation.

30:43.875 --> 30:46.351
You could appear
in your Mom's dream.

30:46.375 --> 30:49.708
Please hold on,
it'll heal shortly.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.750
What did you say?

30:52.167 --> 30:54.309
Wounds heal faster in afterlife...

30:54.333 --> 30:57.226
No, dream visitation?

30:57.250 --> 31:00.518
You don't know?
Appearing in dreams.

31:00.542 --> 31:04.625
It's a privilege given to those
who receive reincarnation.

31:05.250 --> 31:07.500
Really? I can meet my mother?

31:09.333 --> 31:11.184
I thought we told you.

31:11.208 --> 31:15.601
Before you reincarnate,
you're allowed to see anyone

31:15.625 --> 31:17.518
to say farewell one last time...

31:17.542 --> 31:21.143
People who say they met their
dead father in a dream,

31:21.167 --> 31:23.125
that's what this is.

31:28.875 --> 31:29.875
What's with him?

31:31.042 --> 31:32.042
Mother!

31:33.625 --> 31:34.684
Mother!

31:34.708 --> 31:37.309
Yes, Ja-hong,
it's me, your mother.

31:37.333 --> 31:38.333
Mother...

31:38.500 --> 31:40.917
Stay in character?
Sure, sure.

31:44.208 --> 31:45.208
Mother...

31:49.458 --> 31:50.458
Damn.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.643
This place feels eerie,
even after a century.

31:54.667 --> 31:56.583
We could just walk...

31:57.208 --> 32:01.625
Kiddo, explain this to him
so he doesn't screw us up again.

32:02.750 --> 32:06.059
Think of this as
a special treat for the paragon.

32:06.083 --> 32:09.625
It's a fast transportation system
to pass through this area.

32:16.833 --> 32:17.833
What's he up to?

32:24.625 --> 32:25.625
Let's gel going-

32:50.875 --> 32:53.542
Hell ghoul?
Why is that here?!

32:55.583 --> 32:56.583
Dammit...

32:57.583 --> 32:59.333
Even the time is speeding up!

33:00.125 --> 33:01.768
From the living world...

33:01.792 --> 33:03.208
Is it a vengeful spirit?

33:03.833 --> 33:06.833
Got anymore immediate family
in the living world?

33:26.042 --> 33:27.768
Drastic changes in the afterlife

33:27.792 --> 33:30.708
means your family member
has become a vengeful spirit.

33:33.667 --> 33:34.917
I don't understand...

33:35.333 --> 33:36.333
Sir!

33:38.375 --> 33:39.375
The head!

33:41.208 --> 33:42.208
Get rid of it!

33:56.917 --> 33:58.583
Captain! Pull yourself up!

34:18.417 --> 34:19.268
Cap, you okay?

34:19.292 --> 34:21.351
There!
What?

34:21.375 --> 34:22.476
Smash it!

34:22.500 --> 34:23.500
Smash the column!

34:26.375 --> 34:27.792
Hurry! Please!

35:13.250 --> 35:14.500
Don't understand?

35:14.833 --> 35:17.268
Either your mother or brother!

35:17.292 --> 35:19.976
Somebody has died with a grudge!

35:20.000 --> 35:22.893
And became a vengeful spirit!

35:22.917 --> 35:28.250
With that roaming the living world,
the afterlife has gone to shit!

35:32.125 --> 35:33.125
Mother...

35:33.833 --> 35:35.208
Mama's boy...

35:36.250 --> 35:39.167
Deok-choon, put a blind on him.

35:39.542 --> 35:40.500
Hurry!

35:45.000 --> 35:48.018
Could something have
happened to her?

35:48.042 --> 35:50.934
We're not sure,
but I doubt that.

35:50.958 --> 35:52.934
Please, I need a firm answer!

35:52.958 --> 35:54.184
Is she alright?

35:54.208 --> 35:56.184
You want a firm answer?

35:56.208 --> 35:57.684
Your trial or not,

35:57.708 --> 36:01.434
if hell ghouls are wreaking havoc
and the time has speed up,

36:01.458 --> 36:07.833
we'll never reach the final trial
in 49 days at this rate.

36:10.250 --> 36:12.958
Deok-choon!
Guardian Lee Deok-choon!

36:23.458 --> 36:24.458
Deok-choon.

36:25.333 --> 36:28.393
I'm gonna take a detour,
take over for a bit.

36:28.417 --> 36:31.976
He's a paragon so there won't
be any victims.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.018
If there's a problem,

36:34.042 --> 36:36.625
stall the trial until I signal.

36:38.917 --> 36:40.184
I'm counting on you.

36:40.208 --> 36:43.226
Don't forget that
you and I are linked.

36:43.250 --> 36:44.934
Don't worry, cap.

36:44.958 --> 36:46.018
I'm here.

36:46.042 --> 36:48.143
No, I don't want you to think.

36:48.167 --> 36:49.601
Do me a favor.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.143
Whenever you get an idea,

36:51.167 --> 36:54.768
make sure to doubt it
before acting on it.

36:54.792 --> 36:57.684
If it's good,
then verify with her.

36:57.708 --> 36:59.934
Correct him instantly.

36:59.958 --> 37:01.768
Easy, eh?
It should be.

37:01.792 --> 37:07.417
So aside from protecting Kim,
I don't want you to think.

37:09.667 --> 37:11.083
It's my Sincere hope.

37:12.750 --> 37:13.750
Okay?

37:16.083 --> 37:17.083
Good.

37:47.792 --> 37:50.583
Items of the deceased
accepted by: Kim Su-Hong, brother.

38:03.458 --> 38:05.458
These are Ja-hong's
personal items.

38:16.500 --> 38:17.500
Mom!

38:20.167 --> 38:22.458
Why do you take that?

38:22.750 --> 38:24.833
It's dead!
Throw it away!

38:34.917 --> 38:37.226
My mother is a mute.

38:37.250 --> 38:39.601
She can't talk.

38:39.625 --> 38:46.375
I've never heard her voice
since I was born.

39:36.292 --> 39:37.833
Just wait 2 weeks.

39:38.792 --> 39:40.958
After my discharge,
I'll always stay with you.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.833
Kim Ja-Hong, that bastard!

40:04.333 --> 40:05.875
Who are you?

40:19.667 --> 40:21.125
My deepest condolences, Ma'am.

40:24.958 --> 40:28.851
Mr. Kim saved my life,

40:28.875 --> 40:31.208
I was given a new life
because of him.

40:36.167 --> 40:41.333
I saw the news on TV
and came right away.

40:42.208 --> 40:44.042
I wanted to say farewell...

41:03.458 --> 41:08.958
I haven't had a chance
to say good bye.

41:09.750 --> 41:15.518
If it's not too much trouble,

41:15.542 --> 41:17.792
may I do so privately?

41:27.000 --> 41:28.250
Thank you, Ma'am.

41:33.542 --> 41:34.542
Kim Su-Hong.

41:37.083 --> 41:38.583
Where is the place
of your death?

42:51.208 --> 42:55.875
I must be close to my death.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.583
I can see the grim reaper.

43:00.167 --> 43:02.750
Don't say that!

43:03.333 --> 43:07.167
You're not gonna die, grandpa!

43:22.792 --> 43:24.542
Look at the sky.

43:25.208 --> 43:26.851
Is this the afterlife or a club?

43:26.875 --> 43:28.792
How does the time
pass so quickly?

43:35.542 --> 43:37.458
No tickling.

43:39.333 --> 43:40.333
Excuse me.

43:41.292 --> 43:42.684
Any news of my mother?

43:42.708 --> 43:44.208
No tickling.

43:44.875 --> 43:46.833
Excuse me? Wake up!

43:48.042 --> 43:51.768
Don't disturb her,
she's not taking a nap!

43:51.792 --> 43:55.351
She's looking up
next trial's charges!

43:55.375 --> 43:57.625
You really don't get it,
are you dumb?

43:57.875 --> 44:00.417
Why did you take that off?
Put it back on!

44:05.583 --> 44:07.750
Forget it, it's too late.

44:08.125 --> 44:11.000
Get up, wake her up too.

44:11.667 --> 44:13.458
Open your eyes!
Hurry, come on.

44:15.250 --> 44:17.000
Is it over?

44:18.042 --> 44:19.375
Yeah, over for us.

44:52.667 --> 44:53.667
It's King Yeomra!

45:11.958 --> 45:13.333
Bow, bow!

45:13.750 --> 45:14.833
Bow your head!

45:18.250 --> 45:22.458
He's already dead,
but does he wish to die again?

45:23.083 --> 45:26.125
He's the first paragon
in 19 years, majesty!

45:28.750 --> 45:32.226
And why does our honorable guest

45:32.250 --> 45:35.268
bring forth hell ghouls
and disturb my realm?

45:35.292 --> 45:38.101
Guardian Gang-lim has
gone down to investigate.

45:38.125 --> 45:41.292
He's going as fast as he can,
your majesty.

45:41.542 --> 45:43.809
How will he calm the spirit?

45:43.833 --> 45:47.143
The body will be burned
and its soul eliminated,

45:47.167 --> 45:50.125
but without disturbing
order of the living world.

45:52.375 --> 45:53.375
No!

45:56.125 --> 45:57.143
No!

45:57.167 --> 45:57.684
Hold.

45:57.708 --> 45:58.958
No, you bastards!

45:59.542 --> 46:00.833
' No!
' Stop!

46:01.167 --> 46:02.583
You can't do that!
Please stop!

46:04.458 --> 46:05.458
Stop!

46:05.667 --> 46:08.833
Who the hell are you?
Answer me!

46:09.167 --> 46:11.000
Don't you dare touch my mother!

46:11.458 --> 46:12.875
I'll beat the hell out of you!

46:13.333 --> 46:14.393
Get him off.
I'm so sorry!

46:14.417 --> 46:15.893
Who the hell are you?

46:15.917 --> 46:17.768
How dare you
eliminate my mother!

46:17.792 --> 46:19.583
Get him off of me.

46:20.917 --> 46:22.292
Do you know her?!

46:22.458 --> 46:23.958
Don't pretend to be cool!
I'm sorry!

46:24.333 --> 46:27.083
My apologies, your majesty!

46:28.417 --> 46:29.625
Calm down!

46:31.083 --> 46:32.292
Hold still!

46:35.917 --> 46:37.125
Shut up!

46:37.833 --> 46:39.042
Shut the hell up!

46:39.917 --> 46:41.750
Please give us more time,
honorable king!

46:46.625 --> 46:50.851
Go tell Gang-lim,
if he eliminates the...

46:50.875 --> 46:52.625
Don't bullshit me!

46:54.833 --> 46:56.167
What's with him?

46:58.042 --> 46:59.768
Go tell Gang-lim!

46:59.792 --> 47:02.643
If he doesn't eliminate
the vengeful spirit soon,

47:02.667 --> 47:04.958
I'll go down to
the living world myself!

47:05.833 --> 47:07.083
Yes, your majesty!

47:09.625 --> 47:10.643
My ap0logies!

47:10.667 --> 47:11.667
What the hell are you?!

47:11.917 --> 47:12.917
I'm so sorry!

47:19.583 --> 47:23.643
Is it true that Sgt. Kim
deserted because of his brother?

47:23.667 --> 47:24.143
I dunno...

47:24.167 --> 47:24.934
Do you know anything?

47:24.958 --> 47:27.042
He deserted?
It's been 3 days.

47:28.167 --> 47:31.917
Why'd he desert
just before his discharge?

47:34.208 --> 47:36.726
I feel so bad...

47:36.750 --> 47:39.059
If it was me, my guts would rot.

47:39.083 --> 47:41.000
And full of fucking maggots.

48:01.250 --> 48:04.458
I'll ask you again, who was it?

48:04.750 --> 48:05.726
Sorry, sir!

48:05.750 --> 48:08.458
Buddy, look at his face.

48:09.333 --> 48:12.458
I'll do the same to you
and go to military prison.

48:13.667 --> 48:14.476
I'm sorry!
Sorry, sir!

48:14.500 --> 48:16.667
He's on a suicide watch!

48:17.417 --> 48:22.809
Something over my heart!

48:22.833 --> 48:23.833
Very nice!

48:24.125 --> 48:28.434
A watch badge!

48:28.458 --> 48:30.434
My lyrics are so good!

48:30.458 --> 48:32.434
I wrote it for you, dude!

48:32.458 --> 48:33.917
I love it, sir.

48:35.625 --> 48:39.893
Dong-yeon, get up, dude.

48:39.917 --> 48:42.018
Sir, I can't walk any further.

48:42.042 --> 48:43.042
Of course you can.

48:44.167 --> 48:45.434
Get up, come on.
I'm so exhausted.

48:45.458 --> 48:47.042
You can do this.

48:54.833 --> 48:57.851
It's not that,
I can't sleep at all.

48:57.875 --> 49:01.750
So why can't you?

49:02.875 --> 49:05.917
It feels like someone's
watching me at night,

49:07.833 --> 49:09.333
and I get the chills...

49:11.750 --> 49:13.208
Lieutenant! Salute!

49:14.542 --> 49:17.458
An investigator's here
about Sgt. Kim's desertion.

49:17.875 --> 49:18.958
Is that so?

49:19.708 --> 49:20.958
They sent a it. Colonel.

49:22.458 --> 49:24.458
HQ investigator?
Yes, sir.

49:29.292 --> 49:32.625
Deceit Hell

49:43.250 --> 49:47.309
“Dad will always watch you
from somewhere nearby.”

49:47.333 --> 49:53.601
“So study hard and become
a good person.

49:53.625 --> 49:54.167
If you're a good girl,
over the Christmas...”

49:54.168 --> 49:57.124
Goddess of deceit if you're a
good girl, over the Christmas...”

49:57.125 --> 49:57.542
Goddess of deceit what's that?

49:57.542 --> 49:58.125
What's that?

49:58.708 --> 50:02.059
Kim wrote a letter
to the dead colleague's kid.

50:02.083 --> 50:03.184
As her Dad...

50:03.208 --> 50:05.542
“We'll go to
Disney land together.

50:06.375 --> 50:07.958
I'm so sorry,

50:08.458 --> 50:09.542
and I love you.”

50:09.958 --> 50:10.958
The dead man?

50:11.667 --> 50:13.018
Isn't that the will, then?

50:13.042 --> 50:16.458
That's forgery of
a private document!

50:16.792 --> 50:21.375
“Don't get sick
and always be healthy.”

50:22.125 --> 50:27.851
This is just a sample
of defendant's fake letters.

50:27.875 --> 50:34.351
Before this court validates
the nature of his crime,

50:34.375 --> 50:38.458
I'd like you to pay attention
to the sheer amount of letters.

50:44.292 --> 50:45.643
How many did he write?

50:45.667 --> 50:47.083
98 letters!

50:47.667 --> 50:51.018
That's the number of letters
this “paragon”

50:51.042 --> 50:56.208
sent under the pretense
of giving hope!

50:57.583 --> 51:00.333
98? That many?

51:01.000 --> 51:03.792
Why didn't he write 2 more
and make it a 100?

51:04.708 --> 51:06.208
Are you insane?!

51:14.625 --> 51:16.042
Answer, defendant.

51:16.458 --> 51:20.042
Your legal representative
asked you if you're insane.

51:23.958 --> 51:25.875
My heart ached so much...

51:31.333 --> 51:32.917
They were too young.

51:37.458 --> 51:39.042
Much too young...

51:43.042 --> 51:44.500
That was the only thing...

51:46.708 --> 51:48.333
I could do for them...

52:27.208 --> 52:28.792
Salute!
At ease.

52:30.667 --> 52:34.250
I won't mince words,
let's cut to the chase.

52:35.042 --> 52:39.184
Sgt. Kim has deserted
but his family doesn't know yet?

52:39.208 --> 52:42.018
It's only been a few weeks
since his brother died.

52:42.042 --> 52:44.893
He could be hiding
in the barracks,

52:44.917 --> 52:45.917
but most of all,

52:46.375 --> 52:49.667
his mother could
go into shock...

52:52.250 --> 52:53.667
Your compassion brings
tears to my eyes.

52:54.333 --> 52:56.125
What's with the bullshit?

52:58.417 --> 53:01.833
Sgt. Kim was like
my own brother.

53:02.417 --> 53:07.143
Unlike others his age,
he looked after his men,

53:07.167 --> 53:10.042
and thanks to him
I received some commendation.

53:11.125 --> 53:15.708
We will be contacting
his mother soon.

53:18.042 --> 53:19.833
Where did you bury him?

53:21.625 --> 53:23.500
Defendant, please answer.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.917
Do you refuse to answer?

53:29.958 --> 53:30.958
Defendant!

53:31.458 --> 53:35.351
Her majesty is asking you
if you didn't know about

53:35.375 --> 53:39.518
their pain and despair
upon discovering the truth!

53:39.542 --> 53:41.542
Please answer!

53:42.375 --> 53:47.018
She knew the letters were fake,
but she still waited everyday,

53:47.042 --> 53:49.375
rain or shine, day or night!

53:50.125 --> 53:52.375
Is the defendant
refusing to testify?

53:56.125 --> 53:58.809
You may think that silence
is the best defense,

53:58.833 --> 54:03.333
but I'll gladly cut off
your useless tongue.

54:13.458 --> 54:14.458
Sir!

54:15.042 --> 54:17.292
Cap! Cap!

54:17.875 --> 54:18.875
Captain!

54:20.875 --> 54:22.125
I'm a busy man.

54:23.583 --> 54:24.792
For the last time,

54:26.125 --> 54:27.500
where did you bury him?

54:32.208 --> 54:33.208
Please!

54:36.292 --> 54:42.125
I'll accuse you to the mp
for false information!

54:45.958 --> 54:47.000
That's enough.

54:47.875 --> 54:48.875
No need for that.

54:50.167 --> 54:52.708
Is Kim's last duty report correct?

54:53.208 --> 54:56.250
Kim had a night guard duty
with pvt. Won dong-yeon.

55:04.417 --> 55:05.667
I gave you a chance.

55:06.625 --> 55:07.958
Watch your tongue later.

55:12.125 --> 55:13.458
Assistant guardian
Lee Deok-choon!

55:15.083 --> 55:16.809
No! Not yet!

55:16.833 --> 55:17.833
Assistant guardian
Lee Deok-choon!

55:18.333 --> 55:19.667
Lee Deok-choon reporting!

55:20.333 --> 55:21.333
Initiate link.

55:25.292 --> 55:28.500
I'll now begin our final defense.

55:36.458 --> 55:37.542
Hold on for a bit.

55:40.500 --> 55:42.643
Your highness.
Your highness.

55:42.667 --> 55:45.768
Defendant Kim Ja-Hong
is indeed a liar.

55:45.792 --> 55:47.458
Is indeed a liar.

55:54.708 --> 55:58.643
What you're seeing now is

55:58.667 --> 56:02.059
not only fake letters
to Ji-yeon, who lost her Dad,

56:02.083 --> 56:05.559
but also fake letters to his mother
for the past 15 years.

56:05.583 --> 56:07.333
For the past 15 years.

56:08.958 --> 56:10.750
What the heck?

56:11.417 --> 56:12.750
Shoo! Go away!

56:15.792 --> 56:16.792
Here he comes!

56:19.583 --> 56:20.583
Catch him!

56:28.833 --> 56:34.000
Mother, I injured my arm
while playing with my son.

56:34.458 --> 56:38.893
He lied about a boar injury
as his son's playful trick.

56:38.917 --> 56:41.809
My wife made scorched rice today.

56:41.833 --> 56:46.101
Fearing that his mother would
give up fighting her illness,

56:46.125 --> 56:51.375
he breathed hope into her
by creating a wife.

56:52.500 --> 56:54.476
Then what happened?

56:54.500 --> 56:57.309
His mother overcame
her incurable illness,

56:57.333 --> 57:01.917
made a full recovery!
And leads a fulfilling life!

57:06.000 --> 57:06.792
Mom, try it.

57:08.167 --> 57:08.476
Is it good?

57:08.500 --> 57:11.893
If she knew how he braved death

57:11.917 --> 57:17.934
to earn money and pay
for her hospital bills,

57:17.958 --> 57:21.559
I'd like to ask if her recovery
would've been possible.

57:21.583 --> 57:23.768
If she ever found out!

57:23.792 --> 57:29.143
That all those letters were lies,
imagine her despair,

57:29.167 --> 57:31.809
and would that be treatable?!

57:31.833 --> 57:36.458
I'd like to add that
everyone grew with despair.

57:36.750 --> 57:38.500
One last question.

57:39.417 --> 57:43.583
Do you deny writing
all of these fake letters?

57:43.958 --> 57:47.101
With the anticipation
and hope in those letters,

57:47.125 --> 57:49.976
their sense of loss
would've been equally great.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.268
But they!
Those of the living!

57:52.292 --> 57:57.000
They grew up
as much as their loss.

57:58.792 --> 58:01.726
My dear daddy!
Are you doing well?

58:01.750 --> 58:05.726
Your firefighter friends are
taking good care of us.

58:05.750 --> 58:08.101
I'm doing well in school...

58:08.125 --> 58:11.684
I can do laundry and
make dinner too.

58:11.708 --> 58:14.851
You may be away,
but you're always in my heart.

58:14.875 --> 58:17.059
Watch over me forever.

58:17.083 --> 58:19.208
Your Jewel, Ji-yeon.

58:41.625 --> 58:44.476
Prosecution,

58:44.500 --> 58:47.250
were there any
similar cases in the past?

58:47.375 --> 58:50.184
No, well...

58:50.208 --> 58:51.643
The admiral!

58:51.667 --> 58:54.583
Admiral Yi said
not to announce his death.

58:57.292 --> 58:59.934
To the enemy forces,
of course...

58:59.958 --> 59:01.393
It was a strategic tactic...

59:01.417 --> 59:03.792
The admiral said that
to his allies.

59:04.458 --> 59:07.375
So that his men kept
their morale high.

59:07.792 --> 59:08.875
This is why...

59:10.208 --> 59:13.768
I ordered all paragons to
just pass through

59:13.792 --> 59:15.250
without a trial, didn't I?

59:16.833 --> 59:19.726
In the case of defendant
Kim Ja-hong's fake letters,

59:19.750 --> 59:24.476
this court will dismiss
all charges against him.

59:24.500 --> 59:29.226
Any pieces of evidence
presented today here

59:29.250 --> 59:33.601
are removed and all charges
are dropped immediately,

59:33.625 --> 59:35.958
and he may proceed
to the next trial.

59:36.917 --> 59:39.000
And if you two aren't busy,
come with me.

59:45.292 --> 59:48.833
Outside, now!

59:50.167 --> 59:52.417
I'm getting wrinkles
thanks to you...

01:00:00.542 --> 01:00:03.268
Why are you so desperate
to see your Mom?

01:00:03.292 --> 01:00:06.208
Let's hear why
you're a mama's boy.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.684
Is there something
you want to tell her?

01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:11.018
I've been curious too.

01:00:11.042 --> 01:00:12.292
Read over the next charges.

01:00:15.958 --> 01:00:17.292
Electric rice cooker.

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:22.958
I bought a cooker
that makes scorched rice.

01:00:25.292 --> 01:00:26.292
Smells so good!

01:00:27.042 --> 01:00:29.667
I always had to eat it as a kid.

01:00:31.125 --> 01:00:36.750
Mother only made rice
with an old tin pot.

01:00:42.917 --> 01:00:47.518
But her memory's not
the same as before,

01:00:47.542 --> 01:00:48.643
and burned so many pots.

01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:50.351
Come on!

01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:50.809
Hot!

01:00:50.833 --> 01:00:53.184
So many pots thrown away...

01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:54.542
Mom, you got dementia?!

01:00:57.042 --> 01:00:59.018
Wow! Junk!

01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:00.417
But you know what?

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:04.768
Electric cookers nowadays
can make scorched rice.

01:01:04.792 --> 01:01:06.101
It's a new model!

01:01:06.125 --> 01:01:09.792
So I bought one as a gift,
and left it in the storage,

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.375
I really want her to have it.

01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:13.750
Really?

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:18.684
Is the cooker the only thing
you want to give to her?

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:20.684
That is so stupid...

01:01:20.708 --> 01:01:24.625
Or the letter inside?

01:01:26.125 --> 01:01:28.375
You still got one left.

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:31.375
An unsent letter,

01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:33.458
not a fake one,

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:37.792
but a real letter.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.500
Mr. Kim!

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:49.667
Your mother is alive and well.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.500
Guardian Gang-lim, thank you!

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Thank you so much!

01:01:58.417 --> 01:01:59.417
$u-Hong!

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:02.833
What about my brother?

01:02:03.792 --> 01:02:06.625
He's healthy and
doing well in the military.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.750
Thank you! Thank you!

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Thank you so much!

01:02:12.667 --> 01:02:13.667
Sorry about that.

01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:23.458
Listen up.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.458
His brother is dead and
became the vengeful spirit.

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:29.625
I'm looking into where
and how he died,

01:02:30.708 --> 01:02:33.208
and I'll incinerate his body.

01:02:34.375 --> 01:02:38.101
So long as the spirit is out there,
Kim's trial will be in danger...

01:02:38.125 --> 01:02:39.708
You lied...

01:02:40.542 --> 01:02:43.250
In front of deceit hell...

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:46.375
If he knew the truth,
the trial will go to shit.

01:02:46.875 --> 01:02:49.792
I understand fully,
why the cap is doing this.

01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:53.208
Remove Kim Su-Hong
from your head at once.

01:02:54.042 --> 01:02:55.708
His fate is to be eliminated.

01:02:55.917 --> 01:02:58.643
Could you just hurry up?

01:02:58.667 --> 01:02:59.958
It's been 3 days since you...

01:03:29.458 --> 01:03:32.292
It's alright, dude, don't worry.

01:03:34.125 --> 01:03:36.542
I'll come see you often
even after my discharge.

01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:40.292
If others bother you,
go tell it. Park.

01:03:40.667 --> 01:03:42.875
It's not about that...

01:03:43.708 --> 01:03:45.958
Your brother passed away.

01:03:46.542 --> 01:03:50.500
I feel so bad
watching you bear it all.

01:04:01.583 --> 01:04:02.726
Dong-yeon.

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:03.833
Private first class,
won dong-yeon.

01:04:10.833 --> 01:04:16.625
Let's not waste
new tears on the past.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.208
That's what my brother
said to me, dude.

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.500
So stop crying like a bitch.

01:04:25.917 --> 01:04:27.583
I'm gonna forget him too.

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:34.708
Sergeant...

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.083
Hold the rifle properly.

01:04:52.792 --> 01:04:53.875
I'm sorry!

01:05:10.417 --> 01:05:11.833
Dong-yeon, what's this?

01:05:13.125 --> 01:05:14.542
Why is it so hot?

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:17.750
What do I do?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Dong-yeon...

01:05:26.542 --> 01:05:29.625
Radio it. Park.

01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:34.458
Don't let others find out,
just him, okay?

01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:40.292
Just get it. Park...

01:05:41.458 --> 01:05:43.167
Get it. Park!

01:05:48.333 --> 01:05:51.833
Glacial canyon

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.083
good, very good!

01:05:59.208 --> 01:06:01.125
Look how happy you are!

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:04.226
Next round is injustice hell.

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:07.417
A trial for those
who were unjust.

01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:10.375
We're exactly half way there.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.893
You said there are 7 trials,
and we only did 3.

01:06:14.917 --> 01:06:17.958
Because you'll walk
right through this one.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.476
It's a hell that punishes
those who were unjust,

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:28.542
so a paragon like you
is not applicable for this one.

01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:41.059
My family's okay,
so why is this happening?

01:06:41.083 --> 01:06:44.184
Indeed, very curious.

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:46.208
Could we think about that
while we run?

01:06:57.792 --> 01:06:58.792
Get in! Hurry!

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:03.458
Hewonmak! Hurry!

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:06.167
Hurry, get in!

01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:15.417
Get to the front! Now!

01:07:30.667 --> 01:07:32.500
Su-Hong! Su-Hong!

01:07:33.833 --> 01:07:36.417
What happened?
Su-Hong! Hey!

01:07:38.958 --> 01:07:39.958
$u-Hong!

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.833
Wake up!

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:05.750
Su-Hong, please...

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:08.500
Open your eyes, asshole...

01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:10.750
Kim Su-Hong!

01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:14.667
Sergeant!

01:08:19.957 --> 01:08:20.957
Lieutenant...

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:25.292
I held him and...

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:27.792
The gun...

01:08:28.792 --> 01:08:30.542
It fired by accident...

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.750
I held him, and it just fired...

01:09:05.707 --> 01:09:06.707
Let's clean up.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.375
You bastard!
Clean up the blood!

01:09:17.707 --> 01:09:18.707
No...

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.500
Let's move him first.

01:09:20.957 --> 01:09:23.559
Listen to me, okay?

01:09:23.582 --> 01:09:26.000
Dong-yeon, look at me,
you didn't do it on purpose.

01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:28.059
It's okay,
I can take care of it.

01:09:28.082 --> 01:09:30.332
My promotion
is next month, asshole!

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:50.167
Gotta wipe the floor,
go find a mop.

01:09:52.542 --> 01:09:55.292
Clean it here with this,
let's hurry.

01:10:19.333 --> 01:10:20.458
Captain!

01:10:32.417 --> 01:10:35.667
Injustice Hell

01:10:40.917 --> 01:10:43.726
These are cold-hearted souls.

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:48.542
They're being punished for
refusing to help those in need,

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:50.292
so they're locked away in ice.

01:10:50.917 --> 01:10:51.250
God of injustice

01:10:51.251 --> 01:10:53.792
god of injustice whether
it's a decade or a century.

01:10:56.875 --> 01:11:01.518
The worst form of crime
in injustice hell is

01:11:01.542 --> 01:11:04.708
those who passed statute
of limitation for their crimes.

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:10.708
They concealed the truth
for selfish gains.

01:11:12.458 --> 01:11:15.458
Statute of limitation
does not exist in hell.

01:11:15.875 --> 01:11:19.958
A crime in the living world
will never be erased.

01:11:20.625 --> 01:11:23.042
What do we do with him?

01:11:23.208 --> 01:11:25.625
I can't do this, sir!

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.625
Crime doesn't disappear
even if you keep quiet.

01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:32.643
You got me into this mess!

01:11:32.667 --> 01:11:35.351
Snap out of it!
You just killed a man!

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:37.643
The longer you hide your crimes,

01:11:37.667 --> 01:11:41.393
the harsher your punishment
in this hell.

01:11:41.417 --> 01:11:43.559
Su-Hong cared so much about you!

01:11:43.583 --> 01:11:45.583
He'll understand!

01:11:46.458 --> 01:11:48.684
Your son deserted
his post last night.

01:11:48.708 --> 01:11:50.601
We'll conduct a house search.

01:11:50.625 --> 01:11:51.625
Did he ever contact you?

01:12:44.042 --> 01:12:46.643
What is cap still doing
in the living world?

01:12:46.667 --> 01:12:48.125
When I was young,

01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:55.893
Su-Hong pestered mother
to go on a cable car ride.

01:12:55.917 --> 01:12:57.226
Cable car? Jeez...

01:12:57.250 --> 01:13:02.208
I wanted to scold him
for being so immature.

01:13:02.792 --> 01:13:04.500
I envy you.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.500
Pardon?

01:13:11.792 --> 01:13:14.726
We don't have any
memories of our past.

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:15.750
Hey!

01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:22.958
We don't know how we died.

01:13:24.875 --> 01:13:26.375
Not a single memory.

01:13:27.792 --> 01:13:32.417
That's what I envied the most
while doing this work.

01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:36.917
All 3 of you have no memories?

01:13:37.875 --> 01:13:39.625
Except gang-hm.

01:13:40.292 --> 01:13:44.333
Hewonmak and a petty guardian
like myself have no memories.

01:13:45.542 --> 01:13:47.375
I wish I had some...

01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:51.583
Is this a confessional?
Stop it already.

01:13:53.208 --> 01:13:58.167
There's an interesting truth
when you listen to the souls.

01:13:58.542 --> 01:14:03.559
Even the tragic memories
become beautiful ones

01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:06.458
when they reach the afterlife.

01:14:07.167 --> 01:14:08.792
Just like this place.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Isn't it beautiful?

01:14:14.958 --> 01:14:15.958
Lee Deok-choon!

01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:19.833
“Beautiful”?

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:23.625
How does this place
look beautiful to you?

01:14:23.833 --> 01:14:25.292
This is hell!

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:27.059
You like this place too?

01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:29.726
Your brother'd love it here,
riding a cable car and all.

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:33.833
But he's a vengeful spirit,
he can't reach the afterlife...

01:14:36.458 --> 01:14:38.167
Pardon me?

01:14:49.167 --> 01:14:50.750
What do you mean?

01:14:52.542 --> 01:14:53.601
Screw it!

01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:55.934
Your brother's dead!
He's the vengeful spirit!

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:58.125
Afterlife's all screwed up
because of him!

01:15:25.208 --> 01:15:28.625
This is why the living world
should be left alone!

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Hold on!

01:15:39.208 --> 01:15:40.208
Hold on tight!

01:15:41.292 --> 01:15:43.101
Hold still!
Don't move!

01:15:43.125 --> 01:15:44.125
Don't move!

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:47.333
Hold still!

01:16:07.917 --> 01:16:08.893
Grab my hand!

01:16:08.917 --> 01:16:11.101
My mother is all alone now.

01:16:11.125 --> 01:16:14.559
With Su-Hong gone,
I'll have to reincarnate!

01:16:14.583 --> 01:16:17.226
I have to meet her!

01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:19.500
So please help me!
I'm begging you!

01:16:19.833 --> 01:16:20.833
Grab my hand!

01:16:21.083 --> 01:16:24.000
How can I?
I only have 2 hands!

01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:25.726
Her! Help her!

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:27.083
Grab her!

01:16:41.125 --> 01:16:43.625
You sure love to mess
with the living world.

01:16:44.292 --> 01:16:45.292
It's a hobby to you.

01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:51.917
He should be incinerated,
why bother unearth him?

01:16:52.292 --> 01:16:53.292
To give him a funeral?

01:16:53.708 --> 01:16:56.292
Or let the world know
where he's buried?

01:16:58.667 --> 01:16:59.667
His mother...

01:17:00.417 --> 01:17:02.792
She'll never know the truth.

01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:05.125
Let's give him a proper burial.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
A proper burial?

01:17:07.417 --> 01:17:09.750
We're the ones
about to get buried.

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:13.875
With both brothers dead,
do you feel sorry for her?

01:17:14.167 --> 01:17:16.333
Are we in saving private Ryan?

01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:27.833
Let's burn him.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.250
Afterlife law, article 8.2!

01:17:34.375 --> 01:17:38.292
Vengeful spirit must be eliminated
and its body incinerated immediately!

01:17:43.917 --> 01:17:45.500
Are you breaking the law?

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:47.625
You are disobeying my order.

01:17:57.292 --> 01:17:58.292
Go back.

01:17:58.667 --> 01:17:59.917
I'll catch the vengeful spirit.

01:18:05.667 --> 01:18:09.000
Alright, I'll sign you off
on a 3-day vacation.

01:18:09.542 --> 01:18:12.958
There's some money inside,
rest for a few days.

01:18:14.417 --> 01:18:15.583
I'm okay, sir.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.333
You're okay?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.792
Look at your face right now.

01:18:27.792 --> 01:18:31.417
Why are you shivering?
Still cold?

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:39.167
What if you get interrogated
in this state?

01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:43.000
Look at your face, look at it!

01:18:50.417 --> 01:18:51.417
Dong-yeon.

01:18:52.083 --> 01:18:55.250
Go and think about it
for a few days.

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.042
We have to be strong.

01:19:02.458 --> 01:19:03.458
Do me this favor.

01:19:11.625 --> 01:19:12.167
This is heavenly passage.

01:19:12.168 --> 01:19:13.207
Heavenly passage
this is heavenly passage.

01:19:13.208 --> 01:19:13.833
Heavenly Passage.

01:19:13.834 --> 01:19:15.374
Heavenly passage we'll reach
betrayal hell through here.

01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:17.083
We'll reach betrayal hell
through here.

01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:21.374
Souls who betrayed faith,
are locked away

01:19:21.375 --> 01:19:21.667
betrayal hell souls who
betrayed faith, are locked away

01:19:21.667 --> 01:19:22.250
betrayal hell

01:19:22.251 --> 01:19:24.332
betrayal hell in a mirror,
and gets destroyed.

01:19:24.333 --> 01:19:24.875
In a mirror, and gets destroyed.

01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:34.624
Goddess of betrayal is beautiful.

01:19:34.625 --> 01:19:35.000
Goddess of betrayal
goddess of betrayal is beautiful.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:35.667
Goddess of betrayal

01:19:35.668 --> 01:19:37.666
goddess of betrayal
and just like her beauty,

01:19:37.667 --> 01:19:39.601
and just like her beauty,

01:19:39.625 --> 01:19:42.559
she'll only forgive beautiful betrayal.

01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:44.000
Isn't that beautiful betrayal?

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:48.601
Beautiful betrayal is
selfless betrayals,

01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:51.351
or righteous ones,

01:19:51.375 --> 01:19:56.167
or if it was a betrayal
of the conscience.

01:20:04.042 --> 01:20:10.833
So a righteous man like you
gets a free pass through here.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:58.143
Shed futile grudge that is
disrupting the two worlds

01:21:58.167 --> 01:21:59.809
and give up your revenge!

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:01.809
If you comply,

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:04.851
I'll defend you till the end
so that you'll be reincarnated.

01:22:04.875 --> 01:22:06.208
Screw reincarnation.

01:22:07.708 --> 01:22:09.167
And why should I do
what you ask?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.542
Your brother is in danger
because of you.

01:22:14.542 --> 01:22:15.542
Brother?

01:22:17.667 --> 01:22:19.167
I don't have one.

01:22:19.792 --> 01:22:22.601
Why should I care about someone
who left home 15 years ago?

01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:24.542
And came back as a dead body.

01:22:27.292 --> 01:22:30.667
I understand your rage
and grudge from that day.

01:22:32.333 --> 01:22:33.667
So please stop.

01:22:33.833 --> 01:22:35.292
How would you know that?

01:22:36.333 --> 01:22:37.958
I didn't die that night!

01:22:39.042 --> 01:22:40.375
I was buried alive!

01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:45.125
How would you understand
the pain of being buried alive

01:22:45.958 --> 01:22:47.500
for a whole day?

01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:51.500
I was suffocating,

01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:55.268
in that wet shallow grave,
I begged for help!

01:22:55.292 --> 01:22:56.542
Begged for help...

01:22:58.167 --> 01:23:00.625
Desperate and painful
cry for help.

01:23:02.292 --> 01:23:03.583
Just like my father.

01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:04.750
Father!

01:23:07.792 --> 01:23:10.208
But they didn't hear you,

01:23:11.833 --> 01:23:13.792
they thought you were dead.

01:23:28.292 --> 01:23:29.958
So you'll calm
my vengeful spirit?

01:23:30.792 --> 01:23:32.875
No, I'll decline.

01:23:33.458 --> 01:23:34.643
You don't know!

01:23:34.667 --> 01:23:38.250
They buried my trust
and hope that day!

01:23:39.833 --> 01:23:42.000
They betrayed me!

01:24:13.083 --> 01:24:16.167
So you'll betray me?

01:24:20.542 --> 01:24:22.667
He was so good to me...

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.726
It's too hard...

01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:29.333
You got me into this damn mess.

01:24:54.458 --> 01:24:57.042
Cap, why are you back already?

01:24:59.125 --> 01:24:59.976
Go, keep going!

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.809
He didn't visit home even once
for 15 years after high school.

01:25:05.833 --> 01:25:07.500
I thought he was a good son.

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:12.958
So he just sent money home
after all that?

01:25:13.167 --> 01:25:14.167
Who cares!

01:25:14.333 --> 01:25:16.601
Cap, you should go eliminate
the vengeful spirit.

01:25:16.625 --> 01:25:19.268
At this rate,
the hell ghouls will get us,

01:25:19.292 --> 01:25:20.792
or we'll be eliminated.

01:25:21.125 --> 01:25:22.583
What the hell!

01:25:25.583 --> 01:25:26.583
I'm begging you.

01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:31.625
Please do not eliminate
my brother.

01:25:32.083 --> 01:25:34.000
Why not ask us to
raise the dead instead?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.083
If that's possible,
bring him back to life.

01:25:41.125 --> 01:25:42.125
Mr. Kim,

01:25:42.708 --> 01:25:46.143
we're only capable of
bringing souls here,

01:25:46.167 --> 01:25:47.667
and eliminating the vengeful spirit.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000
No way!

01:25:51.333 --> 01:25:54.125
Save him!

01:25:55.375 --> 01:25:57.625
I know you all can do it!

01:25:58.875 --> 01:25:59.875
Please!

01:26:01.833 --> 01:26:02.917
Save him!

01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:07.167
Please help my brother...

01:27:00.083 --> 01:27:04.684
In despair because of me!

01:27:04.708 --> 01:27:08.375
On a suicide watch list,
private won dong-yeon!

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.042
Vacuum sink hole

01:27:39.667 --> 01:27:43.601
this is the entrance
to violence hell.

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:46.768
The depth is depended
on the defendant's crime.

01:27:46.792 --> 01:27:49.559
You're a paragon,
so it won't take long.

01:27:49.583 --> 01:27:55.309
I saw you saving dogs
and pigs during flood.

01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:58.143
Don't be scared,
it's far easier than that.

01:27:58.167 --> 01:28:01.268
She'll go over the charges
as soon as we jump

01:28:01.292 --> 01:28:04.958
so let her do her thing,
and just jump!

01:28:07.458 --> 01:28:08.458
Begin.

01:28:19.125 --> 01:28:26.083
In despair because of me...

01:28:27.458 --> 01:28:33.250
On a suicide watch list,
private won dong-yeon.

01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:40.958
When you reach your barracks,

01:28:45.292 --> 01:28:50.792
don't ask the seniors their age.

01:29:03.625 --> 01:29:05.792
Help that stupid idiot.

01:29:06.792 --> 01:29:07.792
I beg of you.

01:29:10.542 --> 01:29:12.792
A guardian cannot interfere
with the living world.

01:29:13.917 --> 01:29:15.042
I won't flee again.

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:16.917
I won't.

01:29:17.542 --> 01:29:19.226
Making any physical changes
are prohibited...

01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:22.333
Just save that
pathetic bastard! Please!

01:29:31.125 --> 01:29:32.708
I'll do what you ask.

01:29:33.958 --> 01:29:35.000
I promise.

01:29:36.958 --> 01:29:38.083
Whatever that is.

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:15.458
A figurative question!

01:30:15.667 --> 01:30:17.417
What's causing this phenomenon?

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.018
Captain has done something
he should never do,

01:30:22.042 --> 01:30:24.809
meddling with the living world!

01:30:24.833 --> 01:30:26.958
Don't come!

01:30:28.042 --> 01:30:29.042
No!

01:30:36.625 --> 01:30:38.042
He'll live through this.

01:30:38.458 --> 01:30:39.792
Yes, thank you.

01:30:43.208 --> 01:30:44.417
Let's go, ambulance is coming.

01:30:51.042 --> 01:30:52.792
Buddy, hold on right there.

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.958
I got some last words for him.

01:31:04.083 --> 01:31:06.458
I want you to pass it along.

01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:11.917
So demanding for a prick
who wants a favor.

01:31:12.125 --> 01:31:13.958
So fucking disrespectful.

01:31:14.958 --> 01:31:17.018
Respectfully, sir,
please do this for me.

01:31:17.042 --> 01:31:19.958
I'm willing to do
whatever you ask of me.

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.500
I'll be respectful.

01:31:34.292 --> 01:31:35.708
Dong-yeon.
Dong-yeon.

01:31:38.083 --> 01:31:40.417
It's me, Sgt. Kim.
It's me, Sgt. Kim.

01:31:50.417 --> 01:31:54.542
Arriving at the base,

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.208
assigned to a barrack.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.667
Surrounded by

01:32:04.333 --> 01:32:06.292
my seniors,

01:32:07.917 --> 01:32:12.792
notified of the draft...

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:19.458
Something over my heart!

01:32:20.458 --> 01:32:25.101
A watch badge!

01:32:25.125 --> 01:32:31.309
Angry faces of my seniors,

01:32:31.333 --> 01:32:37.309
everything is scary.

01:32:37.333 --> 01:32:42.184
In despair because of me!

01:32:42.208 --> 01:32:43.417
Sergeant?

01:32:45.333 --> 01:32:46.417
Sgt. Kim...

01:32:54.958 --> 01:32:56.042
Grab Deok-choon!

01:32:57.375 --> 01:32:58.375
Grab her!

01:33:14.958 --> 01:33:16.000
No! No!

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:19.833
Kim! My hand! Grab it!

01:33:20.208 --> 01:33:24.643
Grab my hand! Hurry!

01:33:24.667 --> 01:33:27.250
My hand!

01:33:31.625 --> 01:33:32.625
So what did you do?

01:33:33.958 --> 01:33:34.958
Tell me again.

01:33:36.667 --> 01:33:38.292
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:33:40.042 --> 01:33:43.643
Right, you didn't do
anything wrong.

01:33:43.667 --> 01:33:45.542
Let's make a promise.

01:33:46.542 --> 01:33:48.434
From here on,

01:33:48.458 --> 01:33:51.059
from this moment on,

01:33:51.083 --> 01:33:53.309
let's

01:33:53.333 --> 01:33:54.958
never

01:33:57.083 --> 01:33:59.601
ever waste

01:33:59.625 --> 01:34:03.809
new tears on the past.

01:34:03.833 --> 01:34:06.333
Promise me.

01:34:21.667 --> 01:34:22.667
Assistant guardian?

01:34:28.958 --> 01:34:33.042
Wow, Korean firefighters
should join the avengers!

01:34:33.875 --> 01:34:34.875
Are you okay?

01:34:37.208 --> 01:34:38.208
Hewonmak!

01:34:39.042 --> 01:34:42.042
This trial has a victim.

01:34:46.833 --> 01:34:47.833
A victim?

01:34:49.875 --> 01:34:52.958
Violence hell

01:34:57.375 --> 01:34:58.708
what's going on?

01:35:00.458 --> 01:35:02.583
Who did he beat up?

01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:15.332
God of violence

01:35:15.333 --> 01:35:16.417
god of violence your majesty!

01:35:16.917 --> 01:35:20.559
This case is about
an indiscriminate beating

01:35:20.583 --> 01:35:25.458
of his own brother
when he was in high school!

01:35:26.167 --> 01:35:30.684
You may say that brothers
get into fights often,

01:35:30.708 --> 01:35:34.184
but there is something
you must pay attention to!

01:35:34.208 --> 01:35:37.976
His brother was suffering from
malnutrition at the time!

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.309
At a time when he required
protection from his brother,

01:35:42.333 --> 01:35:46.333
the nature of his crime
is extremely heinous!

01:35:55.542 --> 01:35:58.018
Don't!

01:35:58.042 --> 01:35:59.684
Don't hit me!

01:35:59.708 --> 01:36:00.625
Don't do that...

01:36:03.417 --> 01:36:06.333
No, Ja-Hong, don't do that...

01:36:31.458 --> 01:36:33.143
I knew this'd happen.

01:36:33.167 --> 01:36:35.292
Irresponsible bastard...

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Let's leave.

01:37:02.167 --> 01:37:03.792
What the hell?!

01:37:04.792 --> 01:37:05.792
Dammit...

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.101
I won't flee, I promised you!

01:37:10.125 --> 01:37:11.601
Shut up and walk.

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:13.333
We must recover your body first.

01:37:23.958 --> 01:37:26.559
What's interesting is that

01:37:26.583 --> 01:37:30.667
this case is tied
to the final trial.

01:37:31.083 --> 01:37:33.292
Any record of forgiveness
given to the defendant?

01:37:33.583 --> 01:37:34.583
No, your majesty.

01:37:36.042 --> 01:37:37.684
After the incident,

01:37:37.708 --> 01:37:41.559
neither the perpetrator nor
the victim ever apologized,

01:37:41.583 --> 01:37:47.643
and simply ended sloppily,
ambiguously and fizzled!

01:37:47.667 --> 01:37:51.792
That's how it ended
in our records.

01:37:57.292 --> 01:38:00.768
But that doesn't make any sense.

01:38:00.792 --> 01:38:02.083
They had to live together.

01:38:02.958 --> 01:38:03.958
No!

01:38:04.542 --> 01:38:08.143
After the incident,
the defendant ran away,

01:38:08.167 --> 01:38:11.643
and didn't come home for
15 years until his death,

01:38:11.667 --> 01:38:15.083
never once stepping his foot
inside this house again.

01:38:18.917 --> 01:38:19.893
Your majesty!

01:38:19.917 --> 01:38:22.601
Honorable god of violence!
May I begin our defense?

01:38:22.625 --> 01:38:24.809
I've heard enough!
What's the point?

01:38:24.833 --> 01:38:27.101
No forgiveness and
there's a victim.

01:38:27.125 --> 01:38:28.125
It's over!

01:38:28.917 --> 01:38:29.958
Convict him at once!

01:39:03.792 --> 01:39:04.792
Deok-choon.

01:39:05.375 --> 01:39:08.208
I'll carry out my idea
without consulting you first.

01:39:09.333 --> 01:39:10.333
Get in there.

01:39:11.625 --> 01:39:12.601
Go on!

01:39:12.625 --> 01:39:14.167
Cap! Cap!

01:39:15.083 --> 01:39:16.083
Captain!

01:39:17.583 --> 01:39:18.583
Deok-choon.

01:39:18.958 --> 01:39:20.208
Assistant guardian
Lee Deok-choon!

01:39:20.417 --> 01:39:21.500
Request combined trial.

01:39:25.583 --> 01:39:26.667
Combined trial?

01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:29.917
It's my brother!
Hey, Ja-Hong!

01:39:30.250 --> 01:39:32.667
Kim Ja-Hong!
What're you doing there?

01:39:36.083 --> 01:39:37.083
Request it at once!

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:38.750
But cap...

01:39:39.333 --> 01:39:40.917
Let's cut our losses here.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.542
Deok-choon!
Hold on!

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:48.250
I'll now read
Kim Ja-hong's final verdict.

01:39:49.958 --> 01:39:51.500
We did it!
Good work!

01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:53.309
Deok-choon!

01:39:53.333 --> 01:39:54.351
Your majesty!

01:39:54.375 --> 01:39:56.434
Your majesty! Sir!

01:39:56.458 --> 01:39:57.458
Please!

01:39:59.167 --> 01:40:01.601
In regards to the defendant's
violent crimes,

01:40:01.625 --> 01:40:05.542
I'd like to request combined
trial at the next trial.

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:07.708
Combined trial?

01:40:09.167 --> 01:40:10.167
You hear that?

01:40:12.667 --> 01:40:14.208
What say you?

01:40:14.625 --> 01:40:21.018
I'd like to know if
the assistant guardian

01:40:21.042 --> 01:40:23.643
knows what she's requesting

01:40:23.667 --> 01:40:26.292
in her own words.

01:40:29.375 --> 01:40:31.375
If he's found guilty
in the next trial,

01:40:33.708 --> 01:40:39.500
where the crime is related,
he'll receive a double punishment,

01:40:42.417 --> 01:40:49.184
and his guardians will be
stripped of their privileges

01:40:49.208 --> 01:40:50.708
in the afterlife...

01:40:51.875 --> 01:40:52.917
Deal!

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Do I go to afterlife now?

01:41:10.542 --> 01:41:11.542
Take the lead.

01:41:11.792 --> 01:41:12.792
To the base first.

01:41:13.458 --> 01:41:14.458
Sure.

01:41:43.542 --> 01:41:46.041
This is it, Filial Impiety Hell.

01:41:46.042 --> 01:41:47.541
Eternal desert this is
it, Filial Impiety Hell.

01:41:47.542 --> 01:41:48.500
Eternal desert

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:49.417
eternal desert
a combined trial, Mr. Kim!

01:41:49.418 --> 01:41:50.875
A combined trial, Mr. Kim!

01:41:51.833 --> 01:41:55.167
Deok-choon, stay alert.

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:05.833
We must visit where you lived
3 times before moving on.

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:09.393
Don't even think about
taking off.

01:42:09.417 --> 01:42:11.083
That idiot.

01:42:12.208 --> 01:42:15.292
That pussy, I knew
he couldn't go through with it.

01:42:18.042 --> 01:42:20.125
Back at that trial,

01:42:21.292 --> 01:42:22.976
do you know why he beat me up?

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.625
No, let's go.

01:42:25.375 --> 01:42:27.643
We must go up
before the final trial.

01:42:27.667 --> 01:42:28.958
That night,

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.500
I woke up to find.

01:42:32.667 --> 01:42:35.125
Ja-Hong hesitating before Mom.

01:42:38.833 --> 01:42:40.583
So I asked him
what he was doing.

01:42:41.208 --> 01:42:42.208
What are you doing?

01:42:46.917 --> 01:42:48.333
Ja-Hong, what's up?

01:42:56.333 --> 01:42:57.792
What are you doing
with the pillow?

01:42:59.708 --> 01:43:00.625
Don't do it!

01:43:04.667 --> 01:43:05.667
Don't do it!

01:43:09.958 --> 01:43:13.125
Stop it!
Don't hurt her!

01:43:20.792 --> 01:43:21.792
That hurts!

01:43:22.917 --> 01:43:26.750
Don't hurt me!

01:43:28.875 --> 01:43:30.667
On the night of the incident,

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:37.208
did you try to...

01:43:39.292 --> 01:43:41.542
Kill your mother?

01:43:44.042 --> 01:43:47.208
Is that so?
That's it?

01:43:48.208 --> 01:43:50.542
That's why it's related.

01:43:51.417 --> 01:43:53.875
You attempted murder
of your mother?

01:43:54.125 --> 01:43:57.500
So the Filial Impiety Hell
is the last stop...

01:43:58.292 --> 01:44:00.167
I see it now.

01:44:00.583 --> 01:44:02.500
Answer me, Mr. Kim.

01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:07.833
Were you trying to
kill her that night?

01:44:13.125 --> 01:44:14.125
No.

01:44:18.167 --> 01:44:19.167
Not just her.

01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:28.000
I wanted all 3 of us to die.

01:44:30.958 --> 01:44:35.083
We had no hope whatsoever.

01:44:37.208 --> 01:44:42.000
Kill my terminally ill mother first,

01:44:43.958 --> 01:44:44.958
and then,

01:44:47.167 --> 01:44:54.208
my brother and I were
going to take sleeping pills.

01:44:56.458 --> 01:44:59.625
Is that when you decided?

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:07.792
The day you left home
out of guilt,

01:45:09.625 --> 01:45:12.500
you decided to live

01:45:14.167 --> 01:45:16.125
for your mother and brother

01:45:17.667 --> 01:45:21.417
until your last breath.

01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:24.333
Is that it?

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:28.500
No...

01:45:36.583 --> 01:45:37.583
Don't look at her.

01:45:38.208 --> 01:45:40.000
Can't you read?
Don't look at her.

01:45:41.125 --> 01:45:42.208
Let's hurry up.

01:45:42.792 --> 01:45:44.125
Sure thing.

01:45:45.542 --> 01:45:46.542
She's back again.

01:45:46.833 --> 01:45:47.833
Go stop her.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.143
Please find my son, Kim Su-Hong.
I Miss him dearly.

01:45:51.167 --> 01:45:53.143
Ma'am, you can't
keep coming back.

01:45:53.167 --> 01:45:55.518
Sgt. Kim isn't in the base.

01:45:55.542 --> 01:45:58.018
Ma'am, you can't come inside!

01:45:58.042 --> 01:45:59.476
Ma'am!
Please don't do this!

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:00.792
You're making it
difficult for us!

01:46:04.958 --> 01:46:06.792
Ma, am!

01:46:08.417 --> 01:46:10.417
Huh? Mom?

01:46:12.167 --> 01:46:14.917
Why is she here?

01:46:19.083 --> 01:46:21.792
Ma'am! Please stop!

01:46:32.208 --> 01:46:33.708
Mom, don't cry!

01:46:34.167 --> 01:46:38.958
After I left, I couldn't
bear to see her again.

01:46:39.833 --> 01:46:43.583
Time simply passed after that.

01:46:44.083 --> 01:46:49.875
So whenever you missed her,
you wrote her letters.

01:47:16.917 --> 01:47:19.042
You can't be here,
get out of here!

01:47:19.667 --> 01:47:20.643
What is he doing?!

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:21.667
Kim Su-Hong!

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
It's no use.

01:47:24.625 --> 01:47:26.333
Nothing you can do.
Get out.

01:47:38.708 --> 01:47:40.351
I can empathize.

01:47:40.375 --> 01:47:45.101
Terminally ill mother,
brother's got malnutrition,

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:49.059
but no one ever offers a hand.

01:47:49.083 --> 01:47:51.333
So you made a decision!

01:47:53.667 --> 01:47:56.917
Kill your mother first,
your brother, then yourself!

01:47:57.167 --> 01:47:57.934
Hewonmak...

01:47:57.958 --> 01:48:01.167
He's the furthest thing
from a paragon.

01:48:15.958 --> 01:48:18.208
Where did you get this?

01:48:19.333 --> 01:48:20.333
What are you waiting for?!

01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:22.750
Throw her out!

01:48:24.417 --> 01:48:27.167
Ma'am, I told you
you can't come in here!

01:48:30.625 --> 01:48:33.583
Deok-choon, let's start over,
that'll be faster.

01:48:34.667 --> 01:48:35.667
You know that.

01:48:36.833 --> 01:48:37.833
Of course you do.

01:48:38.417 --> 01:48:39.583
We can start over.

01:48:40.417 --> 01:48:41.792
A century flies by fast.

01:48:42.250 --> 01:48:46.125
Time flies quickly,
reincarnation is a pipe dream.

01:48:46.542 --> 01:48:47.792
We're better off in the afterlife.

01:49:02.458 --> 01:49:03.458
Please, Ma'am!

01:49:06.292 --> 01:49:08.125
Don't do this, please...

01:49:09.708 --> 01:49:11.292
Your son is a deserter!

01:49:16.292 --> 01:49:18.250
Kim Su-Hong, let's go.

01:49:19.375 --> 01:49:21.458
Your mother is living her life.

01:49:48.333 --> 01:49:49.333
Kim Su-Hong!

01:50:31.083 --> 01:50:32.083
Run!

01:50:34.333 --> 01:50:35.333
Hewonmak!

01:50:41.583 --> 01:50:42.583
Hewonmak!

01:51:52.875 --> 01:51:53.875
Hewonmak!

01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:33.625
No! Please!

01:52:49.958 --> 01:52:51.893
No! No!

01:52:51.917 --> 01:52:54.375
No!

01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:18.167
Take a look, Kim Su-Hong!

01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.934
The last image of your brother,

01:53:21.958 --> 01:53:23.667
as remembered by
you and your mother.

01:54:30.667 --> 01:54:31.667
It's Filial Impiety Hell...

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.250
Filial Impiety Hell

01:55:18.667 --> 01:55:20.167
Defendant Kim Ja-Hong!

01:55:20.417 --> 01:55:26.351
I will now begin
the final verdict for your sins

01:55:26.375 --> 01:55:29.167
against your mother!

01:55:30.333 --> 01:55:33.375
Your majesty!
Allow us to defend him!

01:55:34.125 --> 01:55:36.958
Final verdict!
Defendant Kim Ja-Hong!

01:55:37.542 --> 01:55:38.542
Guilty!

01:55:45.125 --> 01:55:46.500
The defendant!

01:55:47.375 --> 01:55:49.333
After that night!
Attempted to murder...

01:55:57.208 --> 01:55:59.476
The defendant did not
yield to his mother,

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:01.268
after that night,
despite all the hardships

01:56:01.292 --> 01:56:04.809
he has not rest at all
suffered by his mother...

01:56:04.833 --> 01:56:05.893
To support his family!

01:56:05.917 --> 01:56:08.167
How dare you!

01:56:08.458 --> 01:56:10.458
This trial is wrong!

01:56:11.333 --> 01:56:13.583
She was unconscious!

01:56:14.792 --> 01:56:16.542
There is no victim!

01:56:17.833 --> 01:56:19.750
You don't know that!

01:56:20.458 --> 01:56:22.042
You don't know anything...

01:56:25.917 --> 01:56:27.333
Bring up the mirror of Karma!

01:56:34.708 --> 01:56:35.708
Ja-Hong!

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:38.500
Ja-Hong!

01:56:42.417 --> 01:56:43.583
Don't do it!

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.167
Don't do this!
What are you doing?!

01:56:51.333 --> 01:56:52.500
I don't know?

01:56:53.833 --> 01:56:56.542
You're the ones
who don't know anything.

01:56:57.458 --> 01:57:00.708
Only your mother knew the truth.

01:57:05.708 --> 01:57:10.375
The defendant's mother
wasn't unconscious!

01:57:10.750 --> 01:57:12.601
She knew that only her death

01:57:12.625 --> 01:57:16.167
would allow her children
to live comfortably!

01:57:16.958 --> 01:57:20.167
She knew all along!
Do you not see?

01:57:33.083 --> 01:57:34.851
Your mother lived

01:57:34.875 --> 01:57:39.101
her painful life with
a spike through her heart!

01:57:39.125 --> 01:57:43.059
She buried the memory
of that night in her heart,

01:57:43.083 --> 01:57:47.833
and waited for her
pompous son to return!

01:57:52.042 --> 01:57:53.375
I deserve to be punished!

01:57:54.125 --> 01:58:00.208
I'll accept any punishment,
please let me see her!

01:58:01.125 --> 01:58:07.333
I must apologize to her!

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.625
You couldn't even do that alive.

01:58:25.625 --> 01:58:28.208
I gave you plenty of time!

01:58:30.458 --> 01:58:32.250
15 long years!

01:58:36.667 --> 01:58:38.208
Read the verdict.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.750
Final verdict!

01:58:50.667 --> 01:58:51.809
The defendant Kim Ja-Hong!

01:58:51.833 --> 01:58:54.500
It's over, we're done.

01:58:54.792 --> 01:58:56.542
Good job, captain.

01:58:57.625 --> 01:59:00.042
What do we do with him?
Bury him again?

01:59:00.875 --> 01:59:02.434
Or eliminate him?

01:59:02.458 --> 01:59:05.226
And the guardians are
stripped of their powers!

01:59:05.250 --> 01:59:08.226
The defendant blamed
his life problems

01:59:08.250 --> 01:59:12.059
and attempted to murder
his own family,

01:59:12.083 --> 01:59:13.083
and as if that's not enough...

01:59:20.667 --> 01:59:23.434
As if that's...

01:59:23.458 --> 01:59:25.559
Not enough,
he wasted 15 years...

01:59:25.583 --> 01:59:26.583
Mom...

01:59:27.417 --> 01:59:28.417
Mom?

01:59:31.125 --> 01:59:32.708
Continue reading!

01:59:34.167 --> 01:59:36.059
Despite causing mental anguish,

01:59:36.083 --> 01:59:39.476
he fled home for 15 years,
a filial impiety sin in itself,

01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:40.768
this court finds Kim...

01:59:40.792 --> 01:59:41.792
Mom...

01:59:43.583 --> 01:59:45.417
Mom, wake up.

01:59:49.167 --> 01:59:50.958
Come on, wake up.

01:59:52.458 --> 01:59:54.917
Dream visitation!
He's in her dream!

01:59:55.417 --> 01:59:56.417
It's Gang-lim's doing!

01:59:57.167 --> 02:00:00.375
Gang-lim, I order you to
halt her dream!

02:00:01.083 --> 02:00:04.333
Your majesty, you must
summon him at once...

02:00:05.167 --> 02:00:07.208
Mom, wake up, hurry.

02:00:14.833 --> 02:00:15.833
Mom.

02:00:21.375 --> 02:00:22.375
Mom!

02:00:26.792 --> 02:00:27.875
It's me, Su-Hong.

02:00:32.583 --> 02:00:34.000
Look at this.

02:00:35.292 --> 02:00:38.375
I'm a supreme justice,
aren't you happy?

02:00:39.958 --> 02:00:42.458
How do I look?
It fits so perfectly.

02:00:43.042 --> 02:00:44.792
See? I did it.

02:00:47.208 --> 02:00:48.208
Mom.

02:00:49.875 --> 02:00:50.875
Why is it so long?

02:00:52.083 --> 02:00:53.059
Look, my minions.

02:00:53.083 --> 02:00:54.083
Afternoon.

02:01:04.083 --> 02:01:05.184
Mom.

02:01:05.208 --> 02:01:12.167
I can't visit you anymore.

02:01:12.958 --> 02:01:17.601
Because I'm assigned
to be heaven's judge.

02:01:17.625 --> 02:01:20.667
I gotta punish bad guys there.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.375
So don't come to the base
looking for me.

02:01:25.333 --> 02:01:26.542
Understand, Mom?

02:01:27.875 --> 02:01:28.875
Got it?

02:01:30.958 --> 02:01:32.667
Okay, Mom?

02:01:33.375 --> 02:01:34.375
Okay?

02:01:36.667 --> 02:01:37.875
Do you remember

02:01:40.875 --> 02:01:43.208
a long time ago,

02:01:50.833 --> 02:01:53.250
When you were in the hospital,

02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:56.309
I was sick with malnutrition,

02:01:56.333 --> 02:02:00.250
you were in pain
and couldn't wake up.

02:02:00.833 --> 02:02:03.500
Those were hard times, right?

02:02:06.250 --> 02:02:08.583
And Ja-Hong...

02:02:09.667 --> 02:02:11.542
That moron...

02:02:12.917 --> 02:02:19.125
I heard you knew
he tried to kill us.

02:02:19.875 --> 02:02:23.375
You knew all along,
is that true?

02:02:24.458 --> 02:02:26.976
And this bastard of a brother,

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:33.601
he couldn't come home
because he felt bad,

02:02:33.625 --> 02:02:39.375
so he worked like crazy
to send us money.

02:02:40.167 --> 02:02:43.601
Ja-Hong, that bastard...

02:02:43.625 --> 02:02:47.143
Worked all his life...

02:02:47.167 --> 02:02:50.958
For you and me...

02:03:00.083 --> 02:03:01.083
Su-Hong...

02:03:16.083 --> 02:03:17.250
My baby...

02:03:21.583 --> 02:03:25.167
You boys didn't do
anything wrong.

02:03:26.875 --> 02:03:29.601
It was all me,

02:03:29.625 --> 02:03:32.500
it's all because
you met a terrible Mom.

02:03:33.167 --> 02:03:34.708
Do you understand?

02:03:37.125 --> 02:03:39.833
I'm sorry.

02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:45.500
Sorry.

02:03:47.542 --> 02:03:48.750
So sorry.

02:03:50.333 --> 02:03:51.333
My baby...

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:54.375
I love you.

02:03:56.458 --> 02:03:57.542
Ja-Hong...

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.292
Mom!

02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:04.792
She can talk?

02:04:05.292 --> 02:04:06.375
It's her dream.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.917
Mom, Mom!

02:04:12.958 --> 02:04:13.958
Mom...

02:04:16.208 --> 02:04:17.208
Mom...

02:04:20.292 --> 02:04:22.708
Mom...

02:04:33.792 --> 02:04:35.292
I love you.

02:04:37.958 --> 02:04:38.958
Mother!

02:04:44.208 --> 02:04:47.208
Mother! Mother!

02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:00.417
Mother...

02:05:07.833 --> 02:05:11.250
All humans live with sins.

02:05:13.625 --> 02:05:20.643
Only a few ever have the courage
to beg for forgiveness,

02:05:20.667 --> 02:05:23.333
and a fraction of them...

02:05:27.208 --> 02:05:29.333
Are truly forgiven.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.208
Afterlife law article 1.1!

02:05:45.875 --> 02:05:49.851
A sin that has been forgiven
in the living world

02:05:49.875 --> 02:05:52.125
will not be judged
in the afterlife.

02:05:55.458 --> 02:05:57.184
Therefore, this court finds

02:05:57.208 --> 02:06:00.184
Kim Ja-Hong innocent
of all charges,

02:06:00.208 --> 02:06:03.292
and orders immediate reincarnation!

02:06:52.292 --> 02:06:54.875
Thank you.

02:07:36.958 --> 02:07:38.125
Bye, Mom!

02:07:42.958 --> 02:07:44.792
So what do we do now?

02:07:46.667 --> 02:07:47.667
Isn't it obvious?

02:07:48.125 --> 02:07:49.250
Take him to the afterlife.

02:07:49.667 --> 02:07:50.667
Who?

02:07:55.292 --> 02:07:56.292
Another paragon?

02:07:57.125 --> 02:07:59.976
He's a vengeful spirit,
how could he be honorable?

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.958
This is all wrong,
it's an error!

02:08:03.125 --> 02:08:04.250
Are you sure?

02:08:04.417 --> 02:08:07.375
And a vengeful spirit can't
even enter the gate of afterlife!

02:08:07.792 --> 02:08:08.792
Oh yeah?

02:08:08.958 --> 02:08:10.393
You didn't know what happened,

02:08:10.417 --> 02:08:12.726
and decided to come for the show

02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:13.958
after all was done?

02:08:14.292 --> 02:08:17.101
You came down to meddle
when I didn't need you...

02:08:17.125 --> 02:08:18.434
What? When did I?

02:08:18.458 --> 02:08:20.268
I only came down
because you called me.

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:22.309
You told me not to act
on my instincts!

02:08:22.333 --> 02:08:23.226
What?

02:08:23.250 --> 02:08:25.875
“Hewonmak!” and you
summoned me.

02:08:27.333 --> 02:08:30.101
You sure love to mess
with the living world.

02:08:30.125 --> 02:08:33.167
Or let the world know
where he's buried?

02:08:35.917 --> 02:08:38.167
Are you breaking the law?

02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:43.125
Anyway, he can't go to the gate.

02:08:45.792 --> 02:08:47.042
No need to go there.

02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:50.333
Go to the Filial Impiety Hell,
where Yeomra is.

02:08:55.125 --> 02:08:57.792
Am I going to hell?
He didn't mention that.

02:08:58.125 --> 02:08:59.875
This is so dumb...

02:09:01.292 --> 02:09:05.268
A massive tornado touched down
yesterday in Kangwondo.

02:09:05.292 --> 02:09:08.434
It was not a common sight
in our country.

02:09:08.458 --> 02:09:10.976
A tornado can be seen
on an island,

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.792
but it was the first time
on the peninsula.

02:09:14.833 --> 02:09:15.851
Parcel delivery.

02:09:15.875 --> 02:09:17.893
There weren't any casualties,

02:09:17.917 --> 02:09:21.208
but a military base nearby
was heavily damaged.

02:09:22.042 --> 02:09:23.059
Experts believe that...

02:09:23.083 --> 02:09:28.226
“Scorched... rice...

02:09:28.250 --> 02:09:31.768
With... electric rice cooker...

02:09:31.792 --> 02:09:33.583
Comfortably. ”

02:10:04.708 --> 02:10:07.875
Mother, it's your son Ja-Hong.

02:10:09.167 --> 02:10:15.101
I heard that your condition
improved drastically.

02:10:15.125 --> 02:10:18.792
Kim's last letter was
delivered to his mother.

02:10:23.292 --> 02:10:26.476
I do not know what he wrote

02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:31.143
in the letter that contained
the real truth,

02:10:31.167 --> 02:10:32.917
I'm not curious either.

02:10:35.708 --> 02:10:37.934
He was just another soul,

02:10:37.958 --> 02:10:41.375
who tried to do
the right thing after death.

02:10:41.958 --> 02:10:46.143
All the letters I sent you

02:10:46.167 --> 02:10:49.917
were lies to make you
feel better.

02:10:52.083 --> 02:10:56.351
I lied about having a wife
who made scorched rice,

02:10:56.375 --> 02:11:02.083
or a son who looked
exactly like me.

02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:09.625
I'll come back home
before it's too late.

02:11:22.042 --> 02:11:27.833
What I'm really curious is,
why I'm not punished

02:11:28.708 --> 02:11:31.833
for meddling with
the living world,

02:11:33.167 --> 02:11:35.792
and why Yeomra tried to test me.

02:11:37.458 --> 02:11:38.875
I need to ask him that.

02:11:55.917 --> 02:11:57.708
We're here to see King Yeomra!

02:11:58.667 --> 02:12:01.833
If you do not step aside,
you will perish!

02:12:02.250 --> 02:12:04.000
Has he gone absolutely mad?

02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:08.268
I'm sure he has a plan,
he's very considerate.

02:12:08.292 --> 02:12:10.559
Yeah, he's too considerate.

02:12:10.583 --> 02:12:14.583
He's so considerate that
I can't figure him out.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.167
Kim Su-Hong...

02:12:19.042 --> 02:12:21.625
Will be our 49th paragon.

02:12:21.958 --> 02:12:23.458
The last one needed
for our reincarnation.

02:12:24.458 --> 02:12:25.875
Let's go, Hewonmak!

02:12:31.542 --> 02:12:32.542
I'll be back.

02:12:49.208 --> 02:12:52.958
Along With The Gods: The Two Worlds.

02:12:54.667 --> 02:12:56.458
Hur Choon-Sam!

02:12:58.083 --> 02:12:59.917
Hur choon-Sam!

02:13:02.917 --> 02:13:03.917
Hur!

02:13:05.792 --> 02:13:09.833
You're the troublemaker
household god?

02:13:16.333 --> 02:13:18.583
Damn, he's so cute,

02:13:19.125 --> 02:13:21.542
too bad he'll ride
the train to hell.

02:13:26.458 --> 02:13:30.375
A 2017 Kim Yong-hwa Film.
