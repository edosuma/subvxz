Let it remain really awkward.

00:15.609 --> 00:16.943
I call, you get here

00:16.977 --> 00:18.193
on the first...
not the second,

00:18.228 --> 00:19.420
not the third...
flight.

00:19.468 --> 00:20.541
What do you want, man?

00:20.575 --> 00:21.979
Why are you here?
30-year-old scotch.

00:22.013 --> 00:23.582
Roscoe's empty bedroom.

00:23.616 --> 00:25.249
Are you sure that
you're okay with him

00:25.284 --> 00:26.651
living with Monica?

00:26.685 --> 00:28.118

00:34.144 --> 00:35.383
I think I got under your skin
a little bit.

00:35.418 --> 00:37.117
You did.
So, where are we

00:37.151 --> 00:38.118
gonna sleep, Marty?

00:38.152 --> 00:39.423
I'm gonna start my own shop.

00:39.457 --> 00:40.956
Kaan and associates.

00:40.991 --> 00:42.693
Attention, jogger. Please halt.

00:42.727 --> 00:43.962
What's going on, fellas?

00:43.996 --> 00:45.195
You got any I.D.?

00:45.229 --> 00:47.063
Put your hands above
your head now.

00:47.097 --> 00:48.631
Spread your legs.
You got a weapon on you?

00:48.665 --> 00:50.199

Okay.
40 minutes.

01:02.915 --> 01:05.284
I fight rush hour traffic

bothered to show up on time?

01:11.460 --> 01:13.561
I'm sorry, but...
and by the way, where is Marty?

01:13.595 --> 01:14.562
Jeannie beannie!

01:14.596 --> 01:15.830
Someone wake up
on the wrong side

01:15.865 --> 01:17.165

Don't start, Clyde.

01:17.199 --> 01:18.166
Do you know

01:18.200 --> 01:19.334
what I do to cheer myself up

01:19.368 --> 01:20.836

a case of the blahs?

01:20.870 --> 01:22.838
Whatever you're gonna say
right now, how about don't.

01:22.872 --> 01:25.173
I advise Doug
on a personal matter.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.842
Did you know it is the one-month
anniversary of Doug

01:27.877 --> 01:29.577
and his special lady,
and he is just

01:29.612 --> 01:31.413
stumped on gift ideas.

01:31.447 --> 01:33.281
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

01:33.316 --> 01:36.352
You know what, I would love
a female opinion on this.

01:36.386 --> 01:37.753
Hey, let me
ask you this, Jeannie.

01:37.787 --> 01:38.821
Um, how would you feel

01:38.855 --> 01:41.257
if your man gave you a... hat?

01:41.291 --> 01:42.458
Like, a really great hat?

01:42.493 --> 01:43.793
You're welcome.

01:43.827 --> 01:45.495
Ooh.
Or I could go funny.

01:45.529 --> 01:46.663

Sarah's Jewish,

01:49.535 --> 01:50.835
so, you know...

01:50.869 --> 01:51.868
But it'd be like, "Doug..."

01:51.902 --> 01:53.401
Come on!

01:53.435 --> 01:55.970
What were you just...
And so naughty.

01:56.005 --> 01:57.305
But it would...
I don't know.

01:57.339 --> 01:58.839
Well, that's quite the decision.

01:58.874 --> 02:00.140
Well, I mean, she might say...

02:00.175 --> 02:02.242
Hold on one second.
Or I could write a poem, or...

02:02.276 --> 02:03.343
Hey, where are you?

02:03.377 --> 02:05.745
Yeah, no sex toys
for me this morning.

02:05.780 --> 02:07.881
Are you working on Vegas?

02:07.915 --> 02:10.883
No. Um...

02:10.918 --> 02:12.885
Tamara's down there
with Carlson.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.055
I'm gonna take
a few personal days.

02:16.090 --> 02:17.723
Marty kaan is taking
personal days?

02:17.758 --> 02:18.824
Who is this, really?

02:18.859 --> 02:20.059
Jeannie, I hate to interrupt,

02:20.093 --> 02:21.159
but I think you dropped this.

02:21.194 --> 02:22.561
Get that out of my
face right now.

02:22.595 --> 02:24.062
So this isn't your vagina?

02:24.096 --> 02:25.796
Doug, this is not her vagina!

02:25.830 --> 02:27.097
Jesus, Clyde, grow up.

02:27.131 --> 02:28.231
Hey, so, listen,

02:28.265 --> 02:29.966

catches on fire,

02:30.000 --> 02:31.401
or Clyde's dick
explodes, just...

02:32.669 --> 02:34.136
I'll call you guys soon.

02:35.205 --> 02:37.239
Thought you could use a coffee.

two of those are for you.

02:49.517 --> 02:50.383

02:52.519 --> 02:53.886
You're fine, huh?

02:56.890 --> 02:58.323
Yup.

03:03.897 --> 03:05.665
You talk with Roscoe
about this yet?

03:05.699 --> 03:07.366
No.

03:07.401 --> 03:08.501
You going to?

03:10.570 --> 03:11.704
Yup.

03:11.738 --> 03:12.838
When?

03:18.533 --> 03:19.966
You look like shit.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.335
Morning.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.237
Don't skate by this, Marty.

03:25.272 --> 03:27.105
It's our trials that afford us

03:27.140 --> 03:28.674
the opportunity
to become whole again.

03:28.708 --> 03:29.675
You know, it wasn't

03:29.709 --> 03:31.443

03:31.477 --> 03:33.445
Pop, pop, pop.

03:33.479 --> 03:34.746

03:34.780 --> 03:35.948
Yeah.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.219
Aw, sh...

03:41.254 --> 03:42.420

03:44.490 --> 03:45.623
Hey.

03:45.657 --> 03:47.125

Nate Hyatt.
Doug guggenheim. Hi.

03:48.426 --> 03:49.958
Clyde oberholt.
So sorry.

03:49.992 --> 03:51.890
I was stuck in an
intense breakfast

03:51.925 --> 03:53.525

03:54.760 --> 03:55.794

Hi.

03:55.828 --> 03:56.794
Midori Alexis?

03:56.829 --> 03:58.896

ass kingdom six?</i>

03:58.931 --> 04:00.097
That's the one.
Wow.

04:00.132 --> 04:02.332
I'm sorry, Mr. Hyatt,
I have to ask:

04:02.367 --> 04:03.934
Is-is she as down-to-earth
in real life

04:03.968 --> 04:05.401
as she comes across
in her movies?

04:05.436 --> 04:07.537
Uh, she's... she's,
yeah, she's okay.

04:07.571 --> 04:08.938
God, I knew it.
I knew it.

04:08.972 --> 04:10.773
You can tell, I think.
You can always tell. Yeah.

04:10.807 --> 04:11.807
Yeah.
God, that's great.

04:11.842 --> 04:12.942
But we've been locked in

04:12.976 --> 04:14.376
deep negotiations with her,
trying to do

04:14.411 --> 04:15.411
a mold for
us, and I...

04:15.445 --> 04:16.577
in any case, I'm
very, very sorry

04:16.613 --> 04:18.480
to keep you guys waiting. No.

04:18.514 --> 04:19.814
Listen, if it means
that the whole world

04:19.848 --> 04:20.815
will finally have full access

04:20.849 --> 04:22.283
to midori Alexis's vagina

04:22.317 --> 04:24.751
and anus, I say who are we
to complain, you know?

04:24.786 --> 04:26.586
Fingers crossed.

I've tried my best to carry

05:33.345 --> 05:35.679
He had a real commitment
to building here in America,

05:35.713 --> 05:38.215
to top-quality materials
and evolved design.

05:38.249 --> 05:40.283
You know, we use
hypo-allergenic rubber, we use

05:40.317 --> 05:41.551
medical-grade silicone.

05:41.585 --> 05:43.485
But your competitors
are killing you on price

05:43.520 --> 05:44.720
by using sub-standard
materials

05:44.754 --> 05:45.754
from China, right?
Uh-huh.

05:45.789 --> 05:47.356
Okay, so the question becomes,

05:47.390 --> 05:48.957
how do you maintain your margins

05:48.991 --> 05:50.258
without damaging
your brand, right?

05:50.292 --> 05:52.294
Exactly. I don't want to
slash quality control.

05:52.329 --> 05:53.863
I don't want to slash r and d.

05:53.897 --> 05:54.997
We're very proud
of our green initiative.

05:55.031 --> 05:56.065

05:56.099 --> 05:57.833

footprint up in her vagoo,

to the home office,
get you something

06:02.940 --> 06:03.973

all right?

06:04.007 --> 06:05.140
Excellent, thank you.
Thank you so much.

06:05.175 --> 06:06.375
God, I can't believe...
I never realized...

06:06.409 --> 06:07.542
Can you hang on a second?

06:07.576 --> 06:08.810
Yeah.

06:08.844 --> 06:10.744
Um... so, what was
all that about?

06:10.779 --> 06:11.779
What was what?

06:11.813 --> 06:13.347
The giggling, the whispering.

06:13.381 --> 06:14.781
Oh.

06:14.816 --> 06:16.583
No, no, I was just... uh...

06:16.618 --> 06:17.751
Nothing.

06:17.785 --> 06:19.285
You're not gonna get
counseled out or anything,

06:19.320 --> 06:20.587
if that's-that's
how the lingo goes.

06:20.621 --> 06:21.855
Just say it.

06:21.889 --> 06:23.623
I suppose I found it amusing

06:23.657 --> 06:26.359
just that you were talking about
top-quality materials

06:26.393 --> 06:28.328
and evolved design, you know.

06:28.362 --> 06:31.097
Like... like you were building
a particle accelerator.

06:31.131 --> 06:32.832
Have you ever tried
our merchandise?

06:32.866 --> 06:34.834
Have I tried your merchandise?
Yeah.

06:34.868 --> 06:36.068
I'm not trying to be...
I just think

06:36.103 --> 06:37.203
we make a superior product.

06:37.237 --> 06:39.205
I'll have my assistant
send you something.

06:39.239 --> 06:41.340
I don't need... that's okay,
you don't have to have...

06:41.374 --> 06:44.537
Hey, Kathy, can you,
uh, send a package

06:44.572 --> 06:46.773
of some of our best-sellers
over to Jeannie Van Der hooven

06:46.807 --> 06:48.341
at galweather stearn, please?

06:48.375 --> 06:49.542
Not to work.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.876
Kathy, don't send me
any dongs, please.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.244
Rush delivery, please.
Thank you.

06:53.513 --> 06:54.847
Listen,

06:54.881 --> 06:56.615
if you were consulting Sara Lee,

06:56.650 --> 06:58.717
you would have a slice
of their pound cake, right?

06:58.751 --> 06:59.951
I would... do you hear yourself

06:59.985 --> 07:01.119
when you're asking
these questions?

07:01.153 --> 07:02.420
Actually, I do.

07:02.454 --> 07:05.255
Is it embarrassing when I talk
about my job? Sometimes.

07:05.290 --> 07:07.524
Do I wish I sold plumbing
gaskets or vacuum cleaners? No.

07:07.558 --> 07:08.792
Not even a little bit.

07:08.826 --> 07:10.593
You know, it's really fun
to talk about sex all day.

07:10.628 --> 07:12.229
I don't know about you,
but I enjoy sex.

07:12.263 --> 07:13.799
I like sex. I'm not...
Uh-huh.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.006
Doc Johnson is my family legacy
we're talking about.

07:16.041 --> 07:17.141
Sent me to private school.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.976
Sent me to brown,
it sent me to wharton.

07:19.010 --> 07:20.510
I'm not about
to apologize for it

07:20.544 --> 07:23.379
because some China doll
has a stick up her ass.

07:23.414 --> 07:24.547
Stick up her ass would be

07:24.581 --> 07:26.082
a very good product
for your guys.

07:26.116 --> 07:28.250
It would. Can I use your
scowling face for the packaging?

07:33.289 --> 07:34.990
Jeannie?

07:35.024 --> 07:36.624
This just came for you.

07:36.659 --> 07:38.759
It's from... doc Johnson.

07:38.794 --> 07:39.894
They're a client.

07:39.928 --> 07:41.028
Well, it's a rush delivery.

07:41.063 --> 07:42.763
Uh, just give me the
fucking package, zanna.

07:42.798 --> 07:43.764
Sorry.

07:43.799 --> 07:45.366
Okay.

08:07.524 --> 08:10.726
* Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, yes *

08:10.761 --> 08:12.862
* ooh, ah... yes. *

08:12.896 --> 08:14.230
Pops was really
coming after you

08:14.264 --> 08:15.598
with that jung
archetype shit, huh?

08:15.632 --> 08:16.632
Yeah.

08:18.068 --> 08:20.135
No issue that couldn't
be illuminated

08:20.170 --> 08:22.605
by the legend of parsifal.

08:22.639 --> 08:25.441
You notice they're always
anglo-Saxon myths?

08:25.475 --> 08:26.442
Yup.

08:26.476 --> 08:27.543
Those are not our stories.

08:27.578 --> 08:28.978
Yeah. I mean, would it kill him

08:29.012 --> 08:31.180
<i>to throw in a parable
from that's my mama</i>

08:31.215 --> 08:32.381
<i>or the jeffersons?</i>

08:34.152 --> 08:35.885
Yo, remember that
time you stole

08:35.919 --> 08:37.520
his good pen
and took it to school?

08:37.554 --> 08:38.823
Aw, shit.
Oh, my God.

08:38.857 --> 08:39.890
He was on jungian

08:39.924 --> 08:41.158
fire that night.
Yeah.

08:41.193 --> 08:42.727
What was that thing
he kept saying?

08:42.760 --> 08:45.196
"Luminosity entails numinosity."

08:45.231 --> 08:46.798
Numinosity.

08:46.832 --> 08:48.199
Yeah, I remember
looking over at ma,

08:48.234 --> 08:50.802
she's rolling her eyes like,
"this bullshit."

08:50.836 --> 08:52.137
Yup. Get it.

08:52.171 --> 08:54.005
Oh. Oh.

08:54.039 --> 08:55.406
Come on, go, go, go, go.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.474
Oh. Oh.

08:56.508 --> 08:57.875
So, you know, some of my people

08:57.909 --> 08:59.510
have been in touch
about what happened.

09:00.545 --> 09:02.879
We think pursuing legal remedy

09:02.914 --> 09:04.180
right now is just
a waste of time.

09:04.215 --> 09:05.549
Can we just
play the game, Malcolm?

09:05.583 --> 09:07.418
Okay, okay. I feel you.

09:10.022 --> 09:12.089
You got to get the
media to light a fire

09:12.124 --> 09:13.824
underneath this thing, man.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.126
Shit!

09:22.964 --> 09:26.699
Take that...
Motherfucker.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.034
Well, we can eliminate
a product line.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.902
I mean, they're basically
competing with themselves.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.938
Yeah, sure, if you
want to play small ball.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.240
Small ball?
Yeah. Not me, man.

09:35.274 --> 09:37.175
No, I don't think
that's the answer.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.177
I think the road forward
is not contraction.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.178
I think it's innovation.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.679
Innovation?

09:41.714 --> 09:42.780
Their porn star molds

09:42.815 --> 09:44.349
are a gold mine...
look at the figures,

09:44.383 --> 09:45.683
speak for themselves...
so why not offer

09:45.717 --> 09:48.116
a molding for Joe citizen?

09:48.151 --> 09:50.017
It would be like
a build-a-bear workshop,

09:50.052 --> 09:51.585
but for hogs and honey pots.

09:51.619 --> 09:52.852
Yes, exactly!

09:52.887 --> 09:54.254
Jeannie gets
it. Come on!

09:54.288 --> 09:56.222
Stupidest idea I've
ever heard, Doug.

09:56.256 --> 09:57.723
It is the stupidest idea
I've ever heard.

09:57.758 --> 09:59.424
No one wants a mold
of their own penis.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.257
No, that's not
what I'm saying. Of course not.

10:01.292 --> 10:03.025
No. But think
about it, all right?

10:03.060 --> 10:04.360
He's away on business,

10:04.394 --> 10:06.294
she's at home all alone,
missing her man.

10:06.329 --> 10:07.529
What does she do, huh?

10:07.563 --> 10:08.695
Reaches for the bottom drawer,

10:08.729 --> 10:10.127
opens it up. Two hands. Stop.

10:10.161 --> 10:11.193
Gonna need two hands.
No, no.

10:11.227 --> 10:12.427
Stop with the bottom drawer.

10:12.462 --> 10:15.964
Doug, do not get Sarah a mold
of your penis as a gift.

10:15.998 --> 10:19.034
Why not? Its unique proportions
make it quite habit-forming.

10:19.068 --> 10:20.668
Jeannie, will you
please tell Doug

10:20.703 --> 10:22.237
that his penis is not fritos?

10:22.271 --> 10:23.305
I'm stuck
on "unique proportions."

10:23.339 --> 10:24.873
Can you elaborate?

10:24.907 --> 10:26.975
You know what? I know what this
is about. It's so obvious to me.

10:27.009 --> 10:28.209
Look at him.

10:28.244 --> 10:30.144
You-you are so upset
about me and Sarah.

10:30.179 --> 10:32.280
It drives you crazy.
It's so obvious.

10:32.314 --> 10:33.681
Ah, you know what?
You're right.

10:33.715 --> 10:34.915
This is a brilliant idea.

10:34.950 --> 10:36.483
It is. Put me down for two dozen.

10:36.518 --> 10:38.051
Hanukkah is right
around the corner.

10:38.086 --> 10:39.720
You're right around the corner.

10:39.754 --> 10:40.754
What does that even mean?

10:40.789 --> 10:41.758
Shut up.

10:41.792 --> 10:42.761
What does that even mean?

10:42.795 --> 10:43.929
Shut up, I said, so...

10:43.963 --> 10:46.898
God. So annoying to me.

10:47.966 --> 10:49.500
Hi.

10:49.534 --> 10:51.301
Hey, these are schmancy digs.

10:51.336 --> 10:53.437
I think we're overpaying you.

10:53.471 --> 10:55.138
You're definitely overpaying us. Yeah.

10:55.172 --> 10:57.139
What can I help you with?

10:57.174 --> 10:59.642
I was feeling bad about
our encounter earlier.

10:59.676 --> 11:01.142
I was downtown.
I thought maybe

11:01.177 --> 11:03.311
I would see if I could
take you to lunch.

11:03.345 --> 11:06.648
Well... it's 2:45,
so I had lunch.

11:06.683 --> 11:08.417
Yeah, yeah. So it is.

11:08.451 --> 11:10.819
Sorry.
It's the truth.

11:10.854 --> 11:12.521
Uh, and you've had high tea?

11:12.555 --> 11:15.424
Now, I know a place that got
just bitchin' tea service.

11:15.458 --> 11:17.793
They've got clotted cream,
their sandwiches so tiny...

11:17.827 --> 11:19.328
Can't even see 'em.

11:19.362 --> 11:21.397
Well, I am a fan
of invisible sandwiches...

11:21.432 --> 11:22.665
Good.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.100
For sure, but, um,

11:24.134 --> 11:27.136
I actually have a shitload
of work to get done

11:27.170 --> 11:29.271
for this kind of asshole client?

11:29.306 --> 11:31.307
How big an asshole?
The biggest kind

11:31.341 --> 11:32.608
you could imagine.

11:32.643 --> 11:33.943
Like, "oh, I went to brown

11:33.977 --> 11:35.277
"because I wanted
Ivy league status,

11:35.312 --> 11:36.913
but everyone
to think I'm an artist."

11:36.947 --> 11:38.047
Okay, I hate him.

11:38.082 --> 11:39.716
He's the worst. Mm-hmm.
I hate him.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.451
He's the worst. Listen,
it would serve him right

11:41.485 --> 11:43.619
if you drop everything you're
doing, just leave right now,

11:43.654 --> 11:45.288
spend the rest of
the afternoon with me.

11:45.322 --> 11:46.456
Oh.

11:46.490 --> 11:47.724
Oh, by the way.

11:47.758 --> 11:49.092
I should tell you,

11:49.126 --> 11:51.461
I don't really know a place
with good tea service.

11:51.495 --> 11:52.628
Besides england.

11:52.663 --> 11:55.398
Do you have tea at your house?

11:59.770 --> 12:00.870
All right, got to go.

12:00.905 --> 12:02.806
See you later.

12:24.929 --> 12:26.897
"Jaguars and
saber-toothed cats hunted

12:26.932 --> 12:29.166
their prey on what's now
the miracle mile."

12:29.200 --> 12:30.267
Wow.

12:30.302 --> 12:31.535
Does it hurt?

12:32.771 --> 12:34.738
No.

12:37.008 --> 12:38.275
Doesn't hurt.

12:39.544 --> 12:41.211
Let's go.

12:44.082 --> 12:45.849
You want to take a picture?

12:45.883 --> 12:48.284
Hey, don't-don't...
Don't do that.

12:48.318 --> 12:50.787
So, are we just
gonna walk around

12:50.821 --> 12:52.956
and look at the animals all day,
or are we gonna talk about...

12:52.990 --> 12:55.092
We got to finish
this project, don't we?

12:58.730 --> 13:01.766
Yeah, okay. Um...

13:01.801 --> 13:03.868
I was jogging.

13:03.903 --> 13:05.870
I had my earbuds in.

13:05.905 --> 13:07.639
I didn't hear the sirens.

13:07.673 --> 13:09.741
I didn't hear
when the cops called out.

13:09.775 --> 13:11.742
Then things got...

13:11.777 --> 13:13.611
And they just hit you?

13:13.645 --> 13:14.979
Yeah.

13:15.014 --> 13:18.051
What did you do?

13:18.085 --> 13:19.485
I...

13:19.520 --> 13:20.887
What could I do?

13:20.922 --> 13:24.658
I just covered up and tried
to protect myself best I could.

13:24.693 --> 13:26.727
Fucking racist cops.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.162
Okay, Roscoe, come on.
They are.

13:28.196 --> 13:29.697
Fucking racist.
And I don't care.

13:29.731 --> 13:30.998
Who fucking hears it.

13:31.033 --> 13:32.300
Okay, okay, shh, shh, shh.

13:32.334 --> 13:33.935
Okay, come here.
Fuck.

13:33.969 --> 13:35.870
Shh. Listen.

13:35.905 --> 13:37.305
Listen. Listen.

13:37.340 --> 13:38.740
Now,

13:38.774 --> 13:42.945
this wasn't about racist cops.

13:42.979 --> 13:47.251
Yeah, that's a part of it,
but you can't think about it

13:47.286 --> 13:49.488
in terms of good guy
and bad guy.

13:49.522 --> 13:51.590
The bad guy doesn't always
look like the bad guy.

13:55.528 --> 13:58.497
Listen...

13:58.532 --> 14:01.103
You put yourself
out there every day,

14:01.137 --> 14:04.273
and I love that
about you. I do.

14:04.307 --> 14:06.609
But you got to know
that not everybody is gonna...

14:06.643 --> 14:09.315
You know, look at you
and see what I see.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.652
I know, but I...

14:10.687 --> 14:12.755
Listen, I-I know
you've dealt with a lot.

14:12.789 --> 14:16.558
What I'm saying is, it-it...
It keeps coming at you.

14:16.593 --> 14:18.560
And the shit doesn't get easier.

14:18.595 --> 14:21.130
And you've been fierce about it.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.801
You make good choices.

14:25.835 --> 14:28.203
You make smart choices.

14:28.237 --> 14:30.171
And you got to keep doing that.

14:31.607 --> 14:33.541
Okay.

14:35.577 --> 14:37.579
Okay.
All right.

14:43.219 --> 14:45.053
Dad?
Mm?

14:45.087 --> 14:47.655
This could happen to me.

14:47.690 --> 14:49.657
Looking that fabulous?
You kidding me?

14:49.692 --> 14:51.693
Dad.

14:55.430 --> 14:58.699
It's not gonna happen
to you, okay?

15:00.735 --> 15:02.703
Okay.

15:08.010 --> 15:09.977
Dad?
Mm?

15:10.012 --> 15:12.013
I've been thinking.

15:12.047 --> 15:15.417
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to move back home.

15:15.451 --> 15:17.418
You want to move
back in with me?

15:17.453 --> 15:18.686
Yeah.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.021
There goes my sewing room.

15:21.056 --> 15:22.623
What?

15:24.025 --> 15:25.359
You're breaking it to mom.

15:25.393 --> 15:27.428
All right.
All right.

15:27.462 --> 15:28.829
I'm going to the spider house.

15:28.864 --> 15:30.831
Yeah, yeah.

15:34.736 --> 15:35.869
<i>It was somewhere.</i>

15:35.904 --> 15:38.138
I really, really thought
I had tea.

15:38.172 --> 15:40.274
You know, I do have...

15:40.308 --> 15:41.942
Quik.

15:41.977 --> 15:43.611
I'll take some quik.

15:43.645 --> 15:45.546
Great.

15:45.581 --> 15:48.282
You're not gonna be sorry.

15:48.317 --> 15:52.086
Um, speaking of sorry,
I am sorry about this morning.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.754
I'm not normally that...

15:53.789 --> 15:56.623
I mean, I'm kind of a bitch,
but wes...

15:56.658 --> 15:58.793
who's... who is
my former fiancé...

15:58.827 --> 16:00.261
he, uh, sent me

16:00.295 --> 16:02.363
a wedding invitation, so my...

16:02.397 --> 16:03.564
Yeah, I know how that is.

16:03.598 --> 16:04.731
I have an
ex-girlfriend who...

16:04.766 --> 16:06.200
she not only invited
me to her wedding,

16:06.234 --> 16:07.367
but sends me a Christmas card

16:07.402 --> 16:10.003
every single year
with a picture of

16:10.038 --> 16:12.005
these two redheaded fucks
that aren't my kids.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.807
It's like, thank you?

16:13.842 --> 16:15.876
I just think

16:15.911 --> 16:17.111
exes want closure.

16:17.145 --> 16:19.046
They need to feel
like everything's okay.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.681
I don't know why I feel like

16:20.715 --> 16:21.982
this is more about spite

16:22.016 --> 16:23.851
than closure, though.
Aw.

16:23.885 --> 16:25.486
"Fuck you, whore."

16:25.520 --> 16:27.121
Well, could go either way.

16:27.155 --> 16:29.390
Yeah, I think...
oh, well, and, also,

16:29.424 --> 16:31.225
I have not now
nor ever plan to be

16:31.260 --> 16:33.527
known by the name
cunty cunterson, so...

16:33.562 --> 16:35.897
So...
Come on. The po...

16:35.931 --> 16:37.498
I'm sorry, but the post
office delivered this?

16:37.533 --> 16:38.666
Uh-huh.
They thought

16:38.700 --> 16:40.535
a cunty cunterson lived
at your address?

16:40.569 --> 16:41.869
It's not professional at all.

16:42.905 --> 16:44.238
He had to get a calligrapher

16:44.272 --> 16:45.639
to do this. I'm so sorry.

16:45.674 --> 16:47.008
You're having
such a shitty day. Wow.

16:47.042 --> 16:48.743
It's all right.
You should go to this, though.

16:48.777 --> 16:50.545
That's all right.

16:50.579 --> 16:52.547
My day has gotten...
Slightly better,

16:52.582 --> 16:54.516
because of meeting you.

16:54.550 --> 16:56.851
Oh. Thank you.
I can be kind of charming.

16:56.886 --> 16:58.186
You sure can.

16:58.220 --> 17:02.190
You also, sir, manufacture
a pretty sweet fuck stick.

17:02.224 --> 17:03.091
No.

17:04.060 --> 17:05.093
Which one?

17:05.127 --> 17:07.561
The lucid dream number 14.

17:07.597 --> 17:09.431
And that's a quality product,
is it not?

17:09.464 --> 17:10.732
Is it ever...

17:10.767 --> 17:11.933
You've tried it?

17:11.968 --> 17:13.935
Yes, I've tried it.
I have one in right now.

17:13.970 --> 17:15.570
Um, can I see?

17:15.605 --> 17:16.672
Yeah, you can see.
Okay.

17:16.705 --> 17:18.440
Okay.
Let's do this.

17:18.474 --> 17:20.276
Let's do it.
Well, show me.

17:20.310 --> 17:22.109
I don't know. I'm confused.
What's happening?

17:22.145 --> 17:23.912
Um, I'm sorry.
That was a very...

17:23.945 --> 17:26.181
That was a lame joke
for me to try

17:26.215 --> 17:28.117
to get you
to take your pants off.

17:28.151 --> 17:29.985
Oh, you want me to
take my pants off?

17:30.020 --> 17:32.121
I would like you
to take your pants off, yes.

17:32.155 --> 17:34.390
Also like it if you took off
your underwear, if you could.

17:34.424 --> 17:35.891
Uh-huh.
How about this?

17:35.925 --> 17:38.527
I will also take off
my pants in solidarity.

17:38.561 --> 17:39.728
Slow-slow-slow
down. I don't...

17:39.762 --> 17:41.597
Maybe I don't want
to have sex with you.

17:41.631 --> 17:43.098
Really?
It's possible.

17:43.132 --> 17:44.766
No, let's do this.
I doubt it.

17:46.903 --> 17:49.037
Let's get these pants off,
just in case. Yeah, yeah.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.707
Better safe than sorry.

17:51.741 --> 17:52.875
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:54.578 --> 17:55.978
Hey, grandpa, guess what.

17:56.012 --> 17:57.880
I'm moving back home.

17:57.915 --> 17:59.082
Oh, now, that's exciting.

17:59.116 --> 18:00.583
It was time, you know.

18:00.617 --> 18:01.817
It was, indeed.

18:01.852 --> 18:03.886
We got to celebrate.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.320
I can't wait to get back in
I got it.

18:05.355 --> 18:06.922
I'm telling you,
this is something special.

18:06.956 --> 18:09.258
I got everything.
I got the Internet... yo.

18:09.292 --> 18:11.260
Oh, hey!

18:11.294 --> 18:12.928
Young Roscoe.

18:12.962 --> 18:14.296
What's up, Uncle Malcolm?

18:14.330 --> 18:16.165
Hey! Marty, I want you to meet

18:16.199 --> 18:18.066
Dan, Heather

18:18.100 --> 18:19.768
and Byron.
This is him, y'all.

18:19.802 --> 18:21.070
Aren't you guys
supposed to jump up

18:21.104 --> 18:22.247
and say surprise or something?

18:22.272 --> 18:24.240
This is my brother Marty. Yeah.

18:24.274 --> 18:26.409
Roscoe, go-go
finish your project.

18:26.443 --> 18:28.411
Fine.

18:28.445 --> 18:32.182
Shit that happened to you...
it's a goddamn outrage.

18:32.216 --> 18:34.017
Bro, you would not believe

18:34.051 --> 18:35.585
the phone call I had
while you were gone.

18:35.619 --> 18:36.819
Oh, no.
This reporter from

18:36.854 --> 18:37.987
<i>the L.A. times...
Stop right there, man.</i>

18:38.021 --> 18:39.055
No, no, no, no, no.
Hear me out.

18:39.089 --> 18:40.155
Here me out.
Come on, have a seat.

18:40.190 --> 18:41.323
Uh, want a drink?

18:41.358 --> 18:42.624
Have a drink. No drink.

18:42.659 --> 18:44.826
So, we're not
talking about a blurb

18:44.861 --> 18:46.495
in a crime blotter.
This reporter

18:46.530 --> 18:49.532
thinks that your story
can be a springboard.

18:49.566 --> 18:51.300
A springboard for what?

18:51.334 --> 18:54.470
A larger examination of race
right here in Los Angeles.

18:54.505 --> 18:56.472
Series of articles.

18:56.507 --> 18:57.807
Possibly front page.

18:57.842 --> 18:59.610
The reporter's been nominated
for a pulitzer.

18:59.644 --> 19:00.945
A pulitzer? Wow.

19:00.979 --> 19:02.247
Mm-hmm. And he's eager

19:02.281 --> 19:03.548
to sit down with you, Marty.

19:03.582 --> 19:05.049
Now, it doesn't
have to be today.

19:05.084 --> 19:07.051
Or tomorrow.

19:07.086 --> 19:08.786
There is
a time sensitivity to it.

19:08.821 --> 19:10.321
Yeah, it's-it's
sensitive.

19:11.524 --> 19:13.658
Okay. Um...

19:13.692 --> 19:17.195
Uh, Dan, Heather and Brian...

19:17.229 --> 19:18.563
It's-it's Byron.
Oh.

19:18.597 --> 19:19.564
Sorry.
Byron.

19:19.598 --> 19:21.199
Dan, Heather, Byron.
Yeah.

19:21.233 --> 19:22.900
Get the fuck out
of my apartment.

19:24.002 --> 19:25.236
I need you to stop occupying

19:25.270 --> 19:27.205
- my couch right fucking now.
- Oh.

19:27.239 --> 19:29.174
Uh, squirrel, what are you
doing? Yo, sorry, brother,

19:29.208 --> 19:30.742
that I ruined your
little "my brother got

19:30.777 --> 19:32.444
his ass kicked" party.
But you got to go.

19:32.479 --> 19:33.912
Kick rocks. Move.

19:33.947 --> 19:35.847
Uh, no, no, no, my man.

19:35.882 --> 19:38.283
You leave the cheese
and the cracker.

19:38.317 --> 19:39.351
Yeah.

19:39.385 --> 19:40.552
I'm not fucking around.

19:46.425 --> 19:47.391
Really?
Really.

19:47.426 --> 19:48.659
You gonna do
this shit right now?

19:48.693 --> 19:50.661
Yo, you got to go
get baby girl, right?

19:50.696 --> 19:51.996
Heather, baby, wait up!

19:55.701 --> 19:57.002
What?

19:57.036 --> 19:59.404
I'm not gonna be

19:59.438 --> 20:02.207
some poster child, okay?

20:02.241 --> 20:05.243
Yeah, you want this to be
a, uh, private matter.

20:05.277 --> 20:06.544
Yeah. All right, all right.

20:06.579 --> 20:08.046
That's cool.
Okay.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.781
But your brother...

20:09.815 --> 20:11.516
Mm.

20:11.550 --> 20:13.685
This is something
he knows about, Marty,

20:13.719 --> 20:16.721
and, uh, he's trying to make
a connection with you.

20:16.756 --> 20:18.456
Are you feeling okay?

20:18.491 --> 20:19.858
I mean, do we need to adjust

20:19.892 --> 20:21.393
your meds or something?

20:22.462 --> 20:25.097
He's trying, Marty.

20:25.131 --> 20:26.598
He doesn't...

20:26.632 --> 20:28.133
This isn't about me and him.

20:28.167 --> 20:31.636
He's trying to show off
for-for Brian and-and the chick

20:31.670 --> 20:34.438
that got, you know, has got
her tits all over his dick.

20:34.473 --> 20:37.608
He's a fucking selfish
motherfucker... he uses people.

20:37.642 --> 20:39.810
Must be like looking
in the mirror.

20:39.844 --> 20:42.246
Do we have any peanut butter?

20:42.280 --> 20:44.682
I don't know. Try an apple.

20:44.717 --> 20:46.117
All right.

20:48.121 --> 20:50.589
You know, you used
to be like him.

20:50.623 --> 20:53.525
Hmm? Warm and forgiving.

20:53.559 --> 20:56.128
Open to connection.

20:56.162 --> 20:58.964
Yeah.

20:58.999 --> 21:01.066
You got to grab
this opportunity, man.

21:01.101 --> 21:02.334
Take inventory.

21:02.368 --> 21:05.304
The shit that's not working
for you... get rid of it.

21:05.338 --> 21:06.638
The shit that is...

21:06.673 --> 21:09.942
well, take it off the
back shelf, blow the dust off

21:09.976 --> 21:12.444
and hold it out there
for everybody.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.313
Well, for somebody.

21:14.347 --> 21:15.848
Damn.

21:17.217 --> 21:19.517
Right in the middle
of a session, too.

21:19.552 --> 21:20.518
Hello.

21:20.553 --> 21:21.619
Why didn't you answer

21:21.654 --> 21:23.021
my text, Marty?
Vegas is a nightmare.

21:23.055 --> 21:24.889
Where are you?
Yeah, it's been kind of a...

21:24.924 --> 21:27.458
Carlson is losing his shit.
He is tearing apart

21:27.493 --> 21:29.227
our acquisition targets,
finding irregularities.

21:29.261 --> 21:30.595
Is that Marty on the line?

21:30.629 --> 21:32.430
Tell him I want
his ass out here.

21:32.464 --> 21:33.531
Do you hear him?

21:33.565 --> 21:35.366
He wants your ass
out here right now.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.202
Yeah, I heard. I heard.

21:38.237 --> 21:40.972
Listen, it's-it's not
really a good time right now.

21:41.006 --> 21:42.640
What, is he saying no?

21:42.675 --> 21:44.976
Remind him that I own his ass.

21:45.011 --> 21:46.811
I own your ass, motherfucker!

21:46.846 --> 21:48.346
Okay, you need this.

21:48.380 --> 21:49.414
We need this.

21:49.448 --> 21:51.282
You cannot set up your own shop

21:51.317 --> 21:54.785
coming off of an $80 million
deal blowing up in your face.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.787
Get here now.

21:56.821 --> 21:58.688
Fuck.

22:08.499 --> 22:10.801
So, you and Nate were working?

22:10.835 --> 22:12.903
Yes, Nate and I were working.

22:12.937 --> 22:14.504
Then why is your shirt
misbuttoned?

22:15.373 --> 22:16.506
Oh!
Oh!

22:17.542 --> 22:19.309
Jeannie beans,

22:19.344 --> 22:20.944
you've been out
of the game a while.

22:20.979 --> 22:22.846
It was a dark, dark time.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.081
Budding young hos
with no one to look up to.

22:25.116 --> 22:27.317
Mm. And that's what it's
really all about, isn't it?

22:27.351 --> 22:28.518
Inspiring the next generation.

22:28.552 --> 22:30.186
Thank you for reminding
me, Clyde. Of course.

22:30.220 --> 22:31.387
You should
always remember that.

22:31.422 --> 22:33.022
How long had it been?
For real.

22:33.057 --> 22:34.391
Uh, three months, 14 days.

22:34.425 --> 22:35.225
Yup.

22:35.259 --> 22:36.894
What?
What is that?

22:36.928 --> 22:38.228
I'm asking Jeannie.

22:38.262 --> 22:39.563
Are you serious right now?

22:39.597 --> 22:41.865
Doug, are you keeping
a fucking diary or something?

22:41.900 --> 22:43.334
No.
Of course.

22:43.368 --> 22:44.802
Oh, my God.
What? No.

22:44.836 --> 22:46.903
Oh, by the way, I spoke to Nate

22:46.938 --> 22:48.505
about your, um,
build-a-dick idea.

22:48.540 --> 22:50.407
He was totally into it,
and he says he'll let you

22:50.442 --> 22:52.242
do yours for free if
you're interested. Ooh.

22:52.277 --> 22:54.011
<i>If I'm interested?
Are you kidding me?</i>

22:54.045 --> 22:55.312
That was the whole point...

22:55.347 --> 22:56.580
Right, you're messing with me.

22:57.983 --> 23:00.884
Am I losing my acting chops
or is he getting smarter?

23:00.918 --> 23:02.953
Sadly, I think
he's getting smarter.

23:02.987 --> 23:04.988
I doubt it.

23:06.992 --> 23:09.893
I, uh, ran into a door.

23:09.927 --> 23:12.229
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:12.263 --> 23:15.232
welcome to your flight
to Las Vegas today.

23:15.266 --> 23:16.233
Please make sure...

23:16.267 --> 23:17.901
Bullshit, you ran into a door.

23:17.936 --> 23:19.069
Oh, yeah.

23:19.104 --> 23:21.139
Over and over and over again.

23:21.173 --> 23:23.508
Either under your seat
or in the overhead bins.

23:23.542 --> 23:26.110
Also, make sure that your
seat backs and tray tables

23:26.145 --> 23:27.845
are in locked
and upright positions...

23:29.281 --> 23:31.616
and all seat belts
are securely fastened.

23:31.650 --> 23:32.750
Have a nice flight.

23:32.785 --> 23:34.886
I got into an altercation
with the cops.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.888
What?

23:36.922 --> 23:38.990
Are you gon...
I mean, was there any...

23:39.024 --> 23:40.324
No.

23:40.359 --> 23:41.893
You don't want
to talk about it?

23:41.927 --> 23:42.894
No.

23:44.263 --> 23:46.264
Okay.

23:51.470 --> 23:54.339
Okay, you know what I
do want to talk about?

23:55.574 --> 23:57.542
Cock rings.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.779
And Ben wa balls.

24:01.814 --> 24:04.916
And dildos and... plugs.

24:04.951 --> 24:07.452
And, uh...

24:07.487 --> 24:09.955
Bullets, eggs,
beads, harnesses.

24:11.157 --> 24:13.125
Blinders, restraints.

24:13.159 --> 24:16.362
Baby, I just need to know,
did you use them all,

24:16.396 --> 24:19.165
or did you save something up
for the second date?

24:20.201 --> 24:22.168
Oh, you heard.
Heard what?

24:22.202 --> 24:23.636
Uh-huh.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.972
So, what's the story?

24:26.006 --> 24:27.006
There's no story.

24:27.041 --> 24:29.308
There's a story.
Come on.

24:29.343 --> 24:32.278
Did the dildo king
find his dildo queen?

24:32.313 --> 24:35.516
Oh, please.

24:35.550 --> 24:38.319
Obviously, I would prefer he did
not sell vibrating hoo-has.

24:38.353 --> 24:39.487
Well, obviously.

24:39.521 --> 24:43.191
Right, but...
I mean, I-I like him.

24:44.226 --> 24:46.027
Oh, yeah?

24:46.061 --> 24:48.129
Mm-hmm.

24:48.163 --> 24:50.131
Yeah.

24:50.165 --> 24:53.000
Cool.

24:55.571 --> 24:57.505
If you want to talk about it

24:57.539 --> 24:58.839
or, you know,

24:58.874 --> 24:59.941
To this or other...
I know.

24:59.975 --> 25:01.642
I know right where to find you.

25:18.093 --> 25:20.395
Right this way, please.

25:20.429 --> 25:22.063
Mr. Carlson.

25:22.098 --> 25:24.566
Would someone explain
the grand canyon to me?

25:24.600 --> 25:27.035
Five million visitors a year.

25:27.070 --> 25:29.271
Park service is making money
hand over fist, and for what?

25:29.305 --> 25:30.539
It's a big fucking hole.

25:30.573 --> 25:32.107
Yeah, we, uh...

25:32.142 --> 25:33.609
We'll look into that.

25:33.644 --> 25:35.945
But, uh, you had some Questions

25:35.980 --> 25:37.147
about the acquisition targets.

25:37.181 --> 25:39.182
There were some concerns
with irregularities.

25:39.216 --> 25:40.950
Irregularities?

25:40.984 --> 25:43.186
With the acquisition targets.

25:44.221 --> 25:45.355
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.

25:45.389 --> 25:46.690
No, no, I'm over that.

25:50.962 --> 25:52.296
Oh, my God.

25:52.330 --> 25:54.532
Grumpy cat is such an asshole.

25:54.566 --> 25:56.467
Oh, my God.

25:56.501 --> 25:58.469
He's over that.
You know what?

25:58.504 --> 26:00.739
I'm gonna buy atari.
That's what's gonna happen.

26:04.010 --> 26:05.310
I'll see you later, Marty.

26:05.344 --> 26:06.311
Yeah.

26:11.752 --> 26:13.719
Winner!

26:13.754 --> 26:15.688
Oh, yeah!

26:19.493 --> 26:21.127
Now you got to hit it though.

26:21.161 --> 26:22.361
And I believe in you,

26:22.396 --> 26:24.697
because you are my friend.
I believe in you...

26:24.731 --> 26:26.532
You know what?
I'm going big on it.

26:26.567 --> 26:27.867
I'm going big on it.

26:27.902 --> 26:29.202
Jesus Christ.

26:29.236 --> 26:30.837
Yeah. Hard eight.

26:30.871 --> 26:32.472
Brother, do you see
what's on the table?

26:32.506 --> 26:33.907
I don't give a fuck.

26:33.941 --> 26:36.009
Let me see them rocks.
Let's go.

26:36.043 --> 26:37.244
Guys, we need a fucking eight.

26:37.278 --> 26:38.611
Let's go. We need an eight!

26:38.646 --> 26:39.779
This is no joke!

26:39.814 --> 26:42.481
I mean, we really
need an eight!

26:42.516 --> 26:43.582
Let's go, baby!

26:53.117 --> 26:54.683
You feeling lucky?

26:54.718 --> 26:56.751
I'm standing next to the man,
Marty. Roll it, baby!

26:56.786 --> 26:58.986
Why don't you handle it.
Tell me if I win.

26:59.021 --> 26:59.987
Excuse me.

27:00.022 --> 27:02.022
Excuse me.

27:06.494 --> 27:10.997
* I'll be thinking of you still
in the stillness *

27:11.032 --> 27:14.033
* of my life *

27:14.068 --> 27:20.372
* we'd be drinking love
until the day *

27:20.406 --> 27:22.073
* you'd rather hear yourself *

27:22.107 --> 27:23.771
Eight, eight, eight, eight!

27:29.007 --> 27:31.375
One sec.

27:34.378 --> 27:36.346
Give it! Pay up!

27:40.884 --> 27:42.885
Hey.

27:46.289 --> 27:48.991
* You'll be thinking
of me still *

27:49.025 --> 27:50.492
* in the stillness
of your life *

27:50.526 --> 27:52.792
Thank God. I'm fucking starving.

27:54.627 --> 27:57.929
* We'd be sharing promises *

27:57.963 --> 28:01.165
* so warm and blessed *

28:01.199 --> 28:05.302
* until you went to live *

28:05.337 --> 28:08.706
* live by the nauseated *

28:08.741 --> 28:12.500
* I set you free *
