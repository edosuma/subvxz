01:17.760 --> 01:21.958
Mom, turn off Oprah for a second.
l need to talk to you.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.272
Mom.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.478
-Girlfriend.
-ln the house.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.636
You're not Oprah.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.916
Mom, l had a horrible day.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.116
l could really use
some motherly advice now.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.316
Shut up, Bud.

01:42.160 --> 01:47.234
Oprah is doing a show on mothers
who don't pay attention to their sons.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.511
Next, a word from Earth Pads...

01:50.760 --> 01:56.153
... the only feminine-hygiene product
recycled from yesterday's garbage.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.429
-Now can we talk, Mom?
-Oh, okay.

02:01.640 --> 02:02.914
But make it quick.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.351
When Oprah comes back on,
l wanna be rested.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.634
l was working at
the Department of Vehicle Services.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.831
l noticed this long line
for new licences.

02:12.040 --> 02:15.032
When l opened up a second window,
my supervisor comes up and says:

02:15.240 --> 02:19.518
"Son, l see you're a real go-getter.
We hate that here. You're fired."

02:21.960 --> 02:23.552
l need your help getting a new job.

02:23.800 --> 02:28.590
Oh, look, Stouffer's has a new
Apple Brown Betty.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.670
l can't expect you
to pay any attention to me...

02:31.880 --> 02:34.713
...since l don't have an antenna
coming out of my ass.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.509
Peg, l need to talk to you.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.839
Peg.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.197
-Girlfriend.
-ln the house.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.555
Like you'd be anywhere else.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.312
Hey. What'd you do?

03:22.240 --> 03:23.593
What is that thing?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.515
lt's a remote-control override, Peg.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.272
They're on sale
at the Real Man Shop.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.191
Well, while you were there,
why didn't you pick up a real man?

03:40.240 --> 03:41.468
Don't push it, Peg.

03:41.720 --> 03:46.555
lt also overrides all your other
hand-held electronic devices.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.718
Even Otis?

03:51.480 --> 03:53.755
Especially Otis.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.595
Now, listen, Peg, the store next to me
at the mall has gone out of business...

03:57.800 --> 03:59.870
...and Gary wants to rent
the empty space.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.917
Al, is this gonna take long?

04:02.160 --> 04:05.436
You know how l hate it
when the TV set cools.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.556
Now you know how l feel during sex.

04:09.760 --> 04:13.116
Anyway, Peg, Gary's having a contest
for the best new-store idea.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.032
lt's open to all the employees.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.192
That's me and Griff.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.831
But if l can just think of an idea,
there's a cool $10 in it for me.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.391
Al, l happen to have an incredible idea
for a store.

04:30.240 --> 04:35.030
Peg, this isn't gonna be really,
really stupid, is it?

04:35.880 --> 04:37.916
No, it's not.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.357
lt's an all-Oprah store.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.991
l call it the Grand Old Oprah.

04:48.360 --> 04:52.194
You know, we'll sell Oprah T-shirts,
Oprah corn holders...

04:52.440 --> 04:55.034
...Oprah minivan covers...

04:55.280 --> 05:00.479
...and, Al, my very favourite,
Oprah Soap on a " Roprah."

05:04.440 --> 05:07.079
Gee, and l thought
it was gonna be stupid.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.398
Well...

05:13.920 --> 05:15.797
...l'm back from aerobics class.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.715
Although, you know, l didn't really feel
the burn until the bus ride home.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.229
Almost every man on the bus
offered me his seat...

05:22.440 --> 05:25.910
...although nobody was willing
to stand up to let me have it.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.599
Oh, and then
this delightful turban-clad chap-

05:29.800 --> 05:33.554
We'll just call him
Man of a Thousand Boils.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.360
-asked me if l wanted to rub
his magic lamp...

05:36.560 --> 05:38.755
...and see a genie come out.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.553
There was no genie.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.154
God, l wish that there was
an aerobics studio near here.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.588
Pumpkin, would you be quiet?

05:53.800 --> 05:56.519
l'm trying to think of an idea
for a business near here.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.275
All of my beautiful friends wish that
there was just a good gym in the area.

06:00.520 --> 06:05.196
Something in the area
that caters to beautiful women.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.911
l mean, let's face it, there is
no good place for an aerobics studio.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.388
Let's face it...

06:10.640 --> 06:13.677
...l'm not gonna be able
to think of an idea for a business.

06:16.360 --> 06:19.750
Nobody around here
has been eating lead-paint chips.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.677
Al, you should've been here
two hours ago.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.434
-Why? What happened?
-We opened.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.791
While you were
wasting your time opening...

06:30.040 --> 06:34.272
...l came up with a ripsnorting idea
for Gary's new-store contest.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.910
What would be better
right next door...

06:38.160 --> 06:40.310
...than an aerobics studio?

06:40.560 --> 06:43.438
-A topless aerobics studio?
-No, no.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.309
Don't be a pig, Griff. This is serious.

06:46.560 --> 06:50.473
We can finally get rid of this facade
of working and sit around all day...

06:50.680 --> 06:53.478
...looking at beautiful girls in spandex
doing lunges.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.069
-With a honk, honk here
-And a honk, honk there

06:56.320 --> 06:57.639
-Here a honk
-There a honk

06:57.840 --> 07:00.035
-Everywhere a honk, honk
-Everywhere a honk, honk

07:06.760 --> 07:09.274
Come on, Al.
You know Gary won't go for that.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.751
Whenever you make a suggestion,
she does exactly the opposite.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.989
l hear you, l hear you.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.237
So when l bring this up to her,
l gotta be very clever.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.953
Bundy.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.998
What's your big idea
for the new store?

07:25.240 --> 07:28.073
l'm in a hurry
and l'm bloating like a bandit.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.192
Now, l'm only going to say this once.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.758
Anything but an aerobics studio.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.632
You called me down here to suggest
anything but an aerobics studio?

07:44.880 --> 07:48.111
lndeedy do. What do you say?

07:48.360 --> 07:53.354
l'd say "You're fired" if l weren't sure
you'd make more on unemployment.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.071
Look, Gary, l have an idea...

07:56.280 --> 07:58.635
...and l think it's exactly
what you're looking for.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.515
Here it is: anything but Al's idea.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.069
So you're saying an aerobics studio?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.550
-lndeedy do.
-l love it.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.712
Congratulations, you won the prize.
Here's $10.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.313
Hey, don't l get anything?

08:15.560 --> 08:19.997
Yeah, here's $5.
Go get me some Earth Pads.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.313
-There you go.
-Oh, nice, nice.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.312
-Gentlemen, l'd like to propose a toast.
-Hear, hear.

08:30.560 --> 08:34.633
ln the course of human history,
there have been four great inventions:

08:34.880 --> 08:36.232
-The bikini.
-Yes.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.674
The thong bikini.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.035
The really itchy thong bikini.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.832
And Al's idea to put an aerobics studio
next to the shoe store.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.268
-Hear, hear.
-Speech. Speech.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.199
-Speech.
-Speech.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.556
lf l have seen far...

08:55.800 --> 08:59.509
...it's because l have stood
on the shoulders of giants.

08:59.760 --> 09:04.356
Einstein, Magellan, Heineken.

09:06.680 --> 09:11.310
lt is my goal
to uplift the human spirit.

09:18.440 --> 09:21.398
Gentlemen, to your holes.

09:24.120 --> 09:27.669
Oh, man,
we're gonna see some jiggling!

09:38.320 --> 09:41.312
Oh, my God, l'm blind.

09:41.520 --> 09:46.196
They're all fat.
Have they no shame?

09:46.840 --> 09:49.877
Well, Al, this was your idea.
Now what do we do?

09:50.120 --> 09:53.157
Well, we'll just patch up the holes.

09:53.400 --> 09:57.871
Oh, man. Move it, big mama.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.680
-Baby's got backs.
-Hey.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.440
Hey. Hey. Get over there.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.792
Now, like l was saying,
if you can't see them...

10:08.040 --> 10:09.871
...how much trouble
can fat women be?

10:10.120 --> 10:12.759
Okay, girls, do the Dumbo drop.

10:39.080 --> 10:43.312
l don't understand it.
l was a size 6 before aerobics class.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.155
All that jumping
must've expanded my foot.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.758
Then l see you must've fallen
on your butt a time or two.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.274
How dare you say that to my face?

10:55.480 --> 10:59.712
Well, l'd say it behind your back, but
my car's only got half a tank of gas.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.433
-What'd l say?
-Maybe it was more your tone of voice.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.398
Well, who wouldn't be grumpy?

11:09.600 --> 11:12.672
The aerobics studio is the worst thing
that could've happened to us.

11:12.880 --> 11:16.509
That was my last Sweet Tart.
Cough it up!

11:17.840 --> 11:20.559
No, that's the worst thing
that could've happened to us.

11:20.760 --> 11:21.715
-Hi, Al.
-No.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.718
That's the worst thing
that could've happened to us.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.955
Jefferson told me
that it was your idea...

11:32.160 --> 11:35.948
...to put in a metabolically challenged
aerobics studio next door.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.509
-l am so proud of you.
-Here it comes.

11:38.760 --> 11:39.988
So to help you out...

11:40.200 --> 11:43.749
...l have made up these fliers
advertising Gary's Aerobics Studio...

11:43.960 --> 11:48.795
...and l've given them to all of
my full-figured banking customers.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.589
You know, they're gonna get
really hot and sweaty...

11:52.840 --> 11:55.718
...and they're gonna come in here
to buy aerobics shoes.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.837
And remember, shoe man...

11:58.080 --> 12:02.153
...women that large have
a really tough time finding underwear.

12:09.840 --> 12:12.559
Marcie, why are you
doing this to us?

12:13.200 --> 12:17.273
Because l don't like either of you.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.595
Oh, look, there's two of my gals now.
Hi, Rebecca, Arlene.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.917
You look fabulous.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.270
Thanks for your tips
about the aerobics classes.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.637
Yeah, l mean,
l really think l'm starting to tone.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.917
Me too. Corn dog?

12:34.840 --> 12:36.796
Didn't they tell us
not to eat before class?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.150
That was during class.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.999
Well, all right, then.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.348
Well, l'm off.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.036
l've got to leave these fliers
in der Wienerschnitzels...

12:54.240 --> 12:57.869
...and finer girdle shops
all over town.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.830
Not the StairMaster, Bertha.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.157
Anything but the StairMaster.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.677
Well, guess what l'm doing
for money now.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.798
Playing the very young Mr. Lincoln?

13:30.600 --> 13:34.832
No. But then at least l could
look forward to being shot in the head.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.194
No, what you're looking at
is an apprentice chimney sweep.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.795
l'm a regular one,
but they call me an apprentice...

13:41.000 --> 13:43.309
...so they don't have to pay
my health benefits.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.350
Oh, Dad, this is the worst job
l've ever had.

13:51.560 --> 13:52.879
Can you please help me?

13:53.320 --> 13:56.710
Well, like my father used to say
when l came to him with my problems-

13:56.960 --> 13:58.234
"Get out"?

13:58.840 --> 14:01.991
No, actually, it was, " l'm leaving you
and your mom for this hooker."

14:02.200 --> 14:03.952
But now that you mention it-

14:09.280 --> 14:12.192
Al, guess what's under the sheets.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.797
Peg, if l don't like that game in bed,
why would l like it under the lights?

14:19.480 --> 14:21.835
No, speedy.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.955
lt's a scale model of Oprah Land.

14:30.600 --> 14:34.070
See? The tongue
is a moving sidewalk...

14:34.320 --> 14:37.471
...which carries people
into her mouth.

14:37.720 --> 14:41.156
Like so many
unsuspecting McNuggets.

14:44.560 --> 14:47.836
Now, once inside
her climate-controlled head...

14:48.080 --> 14:52.437
...a moving Barcalounger whisks you
past animatronic Oprahs...

14:52.680 --> 14:55.558
...in all her different weights.

14:56.880 --> 15:00.475
l call it " lt's a Big World After All."

15:01.400 --> 15:05.154
Then, after a light lunch
of waffles and gravy...

15:05.400 --> 15:09.075
...you disembark, tell a studio audience
your innermost secrets...

15:09.320 --> 15:12.790
...and snarf down
a whole fried chicken.

15:15.960 --> 15:19.270
Amazing. All this detail,
yet when l ask you for a sandwich...

15:19.480 --> 15:23.029
...you can't figure out
bread, meat, bread.

15:25.080 --> 15:29.437
Big talk from someone who's yet to get
lift, pee, flush.

15:36.320 --> 15:40.393
You leave that head here,
l'll show you lift, pee, flush.

15:44.560 --> 15:49.190
Well, ready for my bus ride
to aerobics class.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.556
This here is my pinch-proof padding.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.518
Oh, pumpkin.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.590
Honey, l've gotta ask you some-

15:59.160 --> 16:03.073
With a high-voltage
anti-fondling device.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.753
-Turn it off.
-What?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.752
Turn it off.

16:07.640 --> 16:11.553
l can't understand you, Daddy.
l'm gonna have to turn this thing off.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.751
Well, serves me right
for touching a family member.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.990
Pumpkin, why do so many
beautiful women...

16:32.200 --> 16:34.794
...travel so far
to go to your aerobics studio?

16:35.560 --> 16:37.357
Two words:

16:38.600 --> 16:40.238
Ramon.

16:40.920 --> 16:44.515
He is a prince.
He's actually more than a prince.

16:44.760 --> 16:49.231
He's an aerobics teacher
formerly known as prince.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.391
Come with me.
l'm gonna drive over there.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.433
l wanna see
if Ramon will change affiliations.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.558
l think he's kind of happy
with women, Daddy.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.356
Well, that makes one of us.

17:11.079 --> 17:15.710
God, look at all this mondo talent
and all these micro bikinis.

17:15.960 --> 17:19.714
All l ask
is for just one seam to burst.

17:25.520 --> 17:28.193
-Hey, Ramon.
-Hey, Kelly.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.237
Who's your daddy?

17:30.760 --> 17:34.230
Oh, this isn't my daddy,
this is my father.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.715
Daddy, meet Ramon.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.757
Kelly, why don't you
warm up the class?

17:38.960 --> 17:40.871
Should we stretch or run in place?

17:41.080 --> 17:44.117
No, just show them one of those
big posters of me in Speedos.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.112
Oh, okay.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.716
Your daughter
is making remarkable progress.

17:49.960 --> 17:53.111
Tell her mother.
l'm here for something important.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.673
l just can't remember what it is.

17:57.360 --> 18:01.114
-Fat-free muffin?
-You certainly are.

18:02.280 --> 18:05.272
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

18:05.520 --> 18:09.399
-That was delicious.
-Sure.

18:11.680 --> 18:14.114
Ramon, if it wouldn't be
too much trouble...

18:14.320 --> 18:16.515
...could we talk in private?

18:24.200 --> 18:27.272
There's this
state-of-the-art aerobics studio...

18:27.520 --> 18:30.478
...and we'd be very, very happy
if you would teach there.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.234
Actually, l'm very comfortable here.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.835
What do you have
that could possibly lure me away?

18:36.080 --> 18:38.833
l'm offering a free membership
to NO MA'AM...

18:39.080 --> 18:41.958
...Chicago's most exclusive
men's club.

18:42.200 --> 18:46.079
With the membership comes-
Hold on to your green card.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.315
luxury boxes at WrestleMania...

18:49.560 --> 18:53.348
...free use of a classic Dodge,
when it's working...

18:54.000 --> 18:57.788
...and a key to the Big 'Uns
reading room in my garage...

18:58.000 --> 19:01.117
...when we get the bowl unclogged.

19:01.560 --> 19:04.518
Well, Mr. Bundy,
as tempting as your offer sounds...

19:09.200 --> 19:11.589
Yeah, you've said a mouthful.

19:12.480 --> 19:13.708
Well, l'll be going.

19:13.960 --> 19:19.159
Don't bother to get the elevator.
l'll just jump out the window.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.038
Don't land on the Porsche.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.991
What does he got that l don't have?

19:24.240 --> 19:26.879
We're both virile men
in the prime of our lives.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.116
Except he's not saddled
with a lazy wife...

19:29.320 --> 19:31.356
...worthless kids,
a prostate like a melon...

19:31.560 --> 19:34.916
...and worst of all,
l sell women's shoes.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.477
Shoes? You sell shoes?

19:38.720 --> 19:42.998
-Yeah, right next to an aerobics studio.
-Did you hear that, Ramon?

19:43.240 --> 19:44.719
He sells shoes.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.918
There's not a shoe store
within miles of here.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.870
Yeah, you never buy us shoes.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.754
Do l not leave the curtain open
when l change?

19:55.000 --> 19:58.276
That's not shoes. We want shoes.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.396
We wanna work out
next to the shoe guy.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.951
Formerly known as Al.

20:05.200 --> 20:09.751
Oh, and by the way, l was just joshing
about that melon thing.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.236
-We're getting shoes.
-Shoes.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.192
Shoes.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.914
Okay. Okay, Bundy, you got me.

20:17.160 --> 20:20.994
You shoe salesmen, you're so lucky.
You get all the women.

20:21.240 --> 20:24.835
Luck has nothing
to do with it, Ramon.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.758
You see, since the dawn of time...

20:26.960 --> 20:31.829
...women and shoes have gone together
like alcohol and firearms.

20:32.080 --> 20:35.993
Oh, sure, we men of the foot
might have a slight PR problem...

20:36.240 --> 20:39.869
...but once you've tried shoe,
you never go back.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.348
Who loves you, baby?

20:43.120 --> 20:44.951
Whoa, wait a minute, now.

20:53.280 --> 20:57.831
Gentlemen, would you prefer
a front or rear view?

20:58.400 --> 20:59.799
What do you recommend?

21:00.360 --> 21:04.239
Well, the rear view is fresh tonight...

21:04.480 --> 21:06.755
...but the locals swear by
the front, so...

21:08.000 --> 21:10.275
Two fronts, please.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.070
Front it is.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.280
-Hey, great work, Griff.
-Thank you.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.313
-The place looks swank.
-Yeah, but we're not finished.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.632
Next week, we put in zoom peepholes
and chin rests.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.955
-Yes.
-Now you're talking.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.510
Gentlemen, to your holes.

21:33.600 --> 21:37.275
-Oh, man.
-Coming through.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.951
Oh, man, Al, are you checking out
that one in red?

21:46.640 --> 21:48.915
Actually, no.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.196
Could someone roll me to a hole?

21:54.040 --> 21:56.429
Oh, sure, buddy.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.908
Oh, this is much better.
