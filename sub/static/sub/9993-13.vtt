00:18.449 --> 00:20.429
Does this young fellow look familiar?

00:21.690 --> 00:22.335
He ought to.

00:23.118 --> 00:28.261
The sad truth is there are boys like him all across our nation.

00:28.953 --> 00:31.308
They're the ones who just can't seem to fit in.

00:32.139 --> 00:35.303
There could be a boy just like him living in your town.

00:35.644 --> 00:38.879
Right on your block, even going to your school.

00:40.143 --> 00:42.191
You might not even be aware of it.

00:42.512 --> 00:44.060
Would you know what to look for?

00:44.362 --> 00:48.083
Would you know how to spot "the outsider"?

00:51.015 --> 00:54.496
The outsider may have stopped applying himself in class.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.651
He's probably given up trying to make friends.

00:59.860 --> 01:04.864
Rightly or wrongly, the outsider has come to feel that everyone is against him.

01:07.683 --> 01:11.329
On the surface, he looks much like any other boy on the block.

01:11.670 --> 01:15.709
But inside, the outsider is eaten away with resentment

01:16.210 --> 01:18.812
and a desperate urge to get even.

01:25.579 --> 01:27.373
If enough of these feelings accumulate,

01:27.933 --> 01:30.084
he may be tempted to act out.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.276
Acting out can take many forms--

01:34.976 --> 01:38.253
antisocial behavior, rejection of one's peers...

01:44.197 --> 01:46.061
...even, in extreme cases...

01:46.815 --> 01:48.143
Mommy.

01:48.287 --> 01:49.050
..mouthing off

01:49.101 --> 01:50.509
to authority figures.

01:50.560 --> 01:51.774
Mommy.

01:58.316 --> 01:59.403
What's going on?

02:00.347 --> 02:01.484
Did you have a bad dream?

02:02.280 --> 02:03.445
Mommy...

02:08.961 --> 02:13.064
Oh, my goodness. This is a bad dream.

02:59.963 --> 03:01.231
I'm just saying that, you know,

03:01.282 --> 03:02.828
she got out once, she'll do it again.

03:02.879 --> 03:03.935
We don't know that.

03:03.986 --> 03:05.056
I think I overslept.

03:05.107 --> 03:05.808
Morning, sweetie.

03:05.859 --> 03:07.888
Morning, Mommy. Morning, Daddy.

03:08.420 --> 03:11.064
No, but we've been to this picnic a couple times before.

03:11.115 --> 03:12.962
You know, history would seem to suggest

03:13.013 --> 03:15.476
that once they figure out how to get over that wall,

03:15.526 --> 03:16.618
then that's that.

03:17.098 --> 03:18.544
What are you guys talking about?

03:18.638 --> 03:19.238
Nothing.

03:20.136 --> 03:21.540
You know what, I'll just go to the store

03:21.591 --> 03:23.261
and get some kind of safety bars or something.

03:23.539 --> 03:25.474
I don't know, I think maybe we should just bite the bullet

03:25.525 --> 03:27.043
and buy Houdini here a big-girl bed.

03:27.459 --> 03:28.979
I think she's ready.

03:29.811 --> 03:31.060
How about it, sweetheart? Huh?

03:31.706 --> 03:32.600
You want a big-girl bed?

03:33.557 --> 03:34.529
Well, wait a second.

03:34.580 --> 03:35.967
Why can't she just take my bed?

03:36.900 --> 03:38.114
I could move into her room.

03:39.322 --> 03:40.771
I'm almost 13.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.752
I'm old enough to have my own room.

03:43.781 --> 03:46.839
Well, this is a conversation we should have when we have more time

03:47.169 --> 03:49.703
because everybody's got to get ready for work, for school.

03:50.113 --> 03:51.822
But why? It's simple.

03:52.886 --> 03:55.473
Marie can move in with Bridgette and I can take her room.

03:55.984 --> 03:58.115
Wait a second, what about me? What do I get?

03:58.277 --> 04:00.665
You get the top bunk.

04:22.023 --> 04:22.942
What do I owe the pleasure?

04:23.454 --> 04:24.208
Is this a bad time?

04:24.625 --> 04:25.620
Not for me.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.495
Those two ar some kind of hell.

04:29.947 --> 04:31.262
It's good, they need a minute alone.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.124
What's up?

04:32.175 --> 04:34.846
You ever heard of a high school called Claymore?

04:35.566 --> 04:37.881
Could be a private school, definitely co-ed.

04:38.065 --> 04:39.446
Not off the top of my head. Why?

04:40.189 --> 04:41.645
I don't know, I just, I had this strange...

04:42.164 --> 04:45.483
- A hunch.
- You could say that.

04:46.098 --> 04:48.268
Anyway, I forgot about it and then something told me

04:48.319 --> 04:50.208
this morning that I should come by here,

04:50.259 --> 04:52.153
run it by you, that you might be able to shed some light.

04:52.649 --> 04:56.353
Not me. No light here. Not a flicker.

04:57.082 --> 04:59.512
But I'd be happy to find any Claymore Highs if they're out there.

05:00.522 --> 05:02.181
Right now I got to get back and, uh...

05:04.516 --> 05:05.795
Unless you want to return the favor.

05:06.283 --> 05:07.180
What do you mean?

05:09.728 --> 05:11.968
They woke up this morning, their seven-year-old was gone.

05:12.038 --> 05:14.178
Window lock was forced open, but there's no ransom note.

05:15.344 --> 05:16.570
I was about to run out there.

05:17.552 --> 05:18.863
Wouldn't mind another set of eyes.

05:31.569 --> 05:33.046
Tyler's room is right down here.

05:40.045 --> 05:41.122
Sorry it's such a mess.

05:41.228 --> 05:43.423
They, uh, asked us not to touch anything.

05:44.006 --> 05:45.571
That's all right, Mr. Downey.

05:47.812 --> 05:49.232
Were any of your son's things taken?

05:49.987 --> 05:52.758
No. I... I don't think so.

05:53.571 --> 05:54.708
Would you like me to ask my wife?

05:54.759 --> 05:55.632
She  would know better than me.

05:56.409 --> 05:57.161
Oh, no, that's okay.

05:58.147 --> 06:00.405
We'll, uh, we'll just be here a few minutes.

06:01.594 --> 06:02.915
We thought about putting up bars.

06:09.636 --> 06:12.845
You know, those... window guards?

06:14.078 --> 06:17.153
Some people in the neighborhood have them, some don't.

06:18.585 --> 06:21.138
When we bought this place,

06:21.649 --> 06:24.218
Paul and I researched how much it would cost to put them on.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.220
But I hated the way they looked.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.826
That number there will get you directly to me 24 hours a day.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.105
We're also monitoring your phone.

06:57.443 --> 07:00.513
And I'd like to keep a detective in your home for a day or so in case we do...

07:01.479 --> 07:02.852
find a note or get a call.

07:10.103 --> 07:12.303
Do you know how many dump sites there are within 50 miles?

07:13.358 --> 07:14.451
Um... a lot?

07:14.599 --> 07:15.854
More than a lot.

07:16.074 --> 07:17.525
They wouldn't even give me a number.

07:18.446 --> 07:21.405
Do you know how many bloodhounds are at the city's disposal?

07:21.620 --> 07:23.679
- Um, not a lot?
- Six.

07:25.259 --> 07:27.056
Well, Allison, it's a start.

07:28.300 --> 07:31.310
You may not have found the needle, but at least you found the haystack.

07:31.987 --> 07:32.933
I'm not so sure.

07:32.984 --> 07:35.504
Maybe his body hasn't been dumped yet.

07:35.588 --> 07:38.154
How do I even know what I saw has happened already?

07:42.402 --> 07:45.934
I forgot to go to the store and get what I needed for Marie's crib.

07:46.751 --> 07:48.406
Oh, good.

07:49.290 --> 07:54.450
I've decided to join the Let's Give Ariel Her Own Room campaign.

07:57.614 --> 07:59.336
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:00.461 --> 08:03.829
guhe's going to need a place to stew once she figures out she hates us.

08:04.457 --> 08:08.035
- Think so, huh?
- I do, too.

08:12.672 --> 08:14.125
Okay, well, great.

08:15.382 --> 08:19.116
Let's swing by the fuure store tomorrow and pick up a bed.

08:21.090 --> 08:22.592
If  I get home from work early enough,

08:22.643 --> 08:24.466
maybe I can even take apart the c

08:25.273 --> 08:27.380
Call my sister, she if she wants to pick it up.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.713
Why do we have to get rid of it?

08:28.764 --> 08:32.312
Why can't we just... put it in garage?

08:34.035 --> 08:34.842
As what?

08:35.403 --> 08:37.297
A shrine to our child-bearing years?

09:30.087 --> 09:31.693
How is he?
Is he going to be all right?

09:31.864 --> 09:33.184
They think he'll get there.

09:33.241 --> 09:35.860
Apparently, somebody drugged him, shot him and drove him to that dump site.

09:36.302 --> 09:38.259
Oh, my God, and he survived.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.456
The bullet glanced off the skull without penetrating.

09:40.507 --> 09:42.707
It happens sometimes with small caliber weapons.

09:43.402 --> 09:44.487
Leaves a hell of an ugly wound,

09:44.538 --> 09:46.438
but it doesn't actually reach the gray matter.

09:47.344 --> 09:48.530
Hopefully, when he wakes up,

09:48.581 --> 09:50.078
he'll be able to describe the guy who took him.

09:50.562 --> 09:51.442
How soon will that be?

09:51.802 --> 09:54.297
Couple hours. Come on.
The doctors are going. Let's go.

10:04.510 --> 10:05.110
Hi.

10:05.663 --> 10:08.432
I think we're both still in a state of shock, you know?

10:08.670 --> 10:11.793
I mean... happy shock, but still shock.

10:12.097 --> 10:13.974
It's a miracle. It's nothing less than a miracle.

10:14.092 --> 10:16.731
And a lot of solid police work, I'm sure.

10:17.490 --> 10:18.784
We're both incredibly grateful.

10:21.193 --> 10:23.849
Oh, you know, there are some friends of ours from the parish.

10:23.897 --> 10:25.661
Can you just excuse us for just a moment?

10:25.936 --> 10:26.766
Oh, no problem.

10:28.670 --> 10:29.445
Excuse me.

10:31.025 --> 10:33.029
I should step outside.
I got a couple calls to make.

10:33.989 --> 10:34.807
Okay. Um...

10:35.116 --> 10:36.762
I'll just stay here in case he wakes up.

10:37.635 --> 10:38.354
Okay.

11:31.586 --> 11:33.054
Tyler. Tyler.

11:33.547 --> 11:34.387
Are you awake?

11:40.066 --> 11:41.159
Is this hell?

11:44.127 --> 11:45.025
You're in a hospital.

11:45.076 --> 11:46.871
You were hurt, but you're gonna be okay.

11:51.409 --> 11:53.045
You swear this isn't hell?

11:56.621 --> 11:58.586
Absolutely, I swear.

12:00.147 --> 12:01.456
But why would you think that?

12:03.992 --> 12:07.374
Because I'm bad. That's where the bad kids go.

12:08.545 --> 12:09.319
Tyler?

12:10.357 --> 12:13.286
My God! Hey! Hey, you're awake?

12:13.447 --> 12:14.773
Hey, hi.

12:20.697 --> 12:22.994
The closet might be a bit of a problem.

12:23.407 --> 12:24.619
I'm gonna have a lot of my own stuff,

12:24.960 --> 12:27.481
so maybe we can get, like, uh, three more shelves.

12:27.957 --> 12:29.102
Just three shelves?

12:31.155 --> 12:34.999
Hi, Mom! I love this room so much.

12:35.183 --> 12:36.173
I'm glad, sweetie.

12:36.831 --> 12:38.096
You're going to knock, right?

12:39.003 --> 12:41.222
'Cause I mean, the new rule, right, privacy?

12:44.129 --> 12:46.133
Do you remember when Saturday used to be our day?

12:46.647 --> 12:47.817
Vaguely.

12:48.072 --> 12:49.686
Mommy!

12:52.149 --> 12:53.122
I don't know.

12:53.693 --> 12:56.891
It still feels sort of... empty.

12:59.703 --> 13:02.290
Can we go to the furniture store tomorrow and get some furniture?

13:02.404 --> 13:04.561
Maybe a lava lamp and some beanbag chairs?

13:04.988 --> 13:07.255
Hey, you know, if you're really so desperate for furniture

13:07.306 --> 13:09.251
maybe I could put that crib back together again.

13:09.302 --> 13:10.290
That's not funny, Daddy.

13:10.341 --> 13:11.472
That's not funny, Daddy.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.376
Yeah, well, we still got to figure out what to do with it,

13:13.427 --> 13:14.431
so what do you say?

13:14.767 --> 13:16.932
We give it to the thrift store or we call my sister?

13:17.337 --> 13:18.826
Do we really have to decide right now?

13:20.426 --> 13:22.640
I just didn't think it was that big of a question.

13:23.551 --> 13:25.211
I just want a little time, okay?

13:32.364 --> 13:34.153
It's funny.
I thought you'd be in a better mood,

13:35.043 --> 13:37.299
what with saving a child's life and all.

13:39.478 --> 13:40.565
I'm in a fine mood.

13:46.181 --> 13:48.768
He said the damndest thing to me when he first woke up

13:48.819 --> 13:51.083
and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.

13:58.725 --> 14:00.346
He  asked me if he was in hell.

14:03.288 --> 14:06.280
Well, in the kid's defense, he did have a pretty lousy day.

14:07.660 --> 14:08.813
No, that's not what he meant.

14:09.041 --> 14:10.780
He thought he was actually in hell.

14:12.961 --> 14:17.526
That he had died and been sent somewhere to be punished because...

14:19.363 --> 14:21.068
he was a bad person.

14:23.687 --> 14:26.007
And I know how this is going to sound, but...

14:29.710 --> 14:33.073
I got the distinct impression that he thought he deserved it.

14:33.124 --> 14:35.472
That  that's where he was supposed to be.

14:38.822 --> 14:40.263
And I can't help but wonder...

14:42.848 --> 14:48.198
how does a terrible thought like that get into a little boy's head?

15:22.050 --> 15:23.940
You belong to your father the devil

15:24.454 --> 15:26.950
and you want to carry out your father's desire.

15:27.828 --> 15:29.542
He was a murderer from the beginning,

15:29.593 --> 15:32.777
not holding to the truth for there is no truth in him.

15:33.369 --> 15:36.661
And when he lies, he speaks his native language

15:37.069 --> 15:40.420
for he is a liar and the father of lies.

15:56.912 --> 15:59.018
Thank you for coming in on a Sunday, Mr. and Mrs. Downey.

15:59.086 --> 16:00.120
No, anything to help.

16:00.230 --> 16:01.208
How long is this going to take?

16:01.259 --> 16:04.058
Our son's asleep and we'd like to be back at his bedside when he wakes up.

16:04.109 --> 16:05.445
We just need to ask a few questions.

16:05.496 --> 16:06.985
Hopefully, rule a few things out.

16:13.844 --> 16:15.086
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Downey.

16:16.426 --> 16:19.487
Detective. Ah, I'm sorry.

16:20.091 --> 16:21.885
Allison. Allison Dubois.

16:24.929 --> 16:25.886
How's Tyler doing?

16:26.299 --> 16:27.438
He's much better, thank you.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.303
He's awake for long stretches.

16:30.301 --> 16:32.063
Even asked for his crayons this morning.

16:32.599 --> 16:33.373
Mr. and Mrs. Downey,

16:33.424 --> 16:36.022
as part of our investigation into your son's abduction,

16:36.073 --> 16:37.994
our lab conducted a toxin screen,

16:38.155 --> 16:40.137
an analysis of your son's blood.

16:40.792 --> 16:41.538
Okay.

16:41.991 --> 16:46.001
And test results seem to indicate that on the night your son was taken,

16:46.056 --> 16:50.211
he was given a massive dose of a prescription sleep aid.

16:50.588 --> 16:51.529
What?

16:51.801 --> 16:52.866
No, no, it's important.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.314
It's important that we hear all this.

16:54.676 --> 16:58.229
Just out of curiosity, do either of you use sleeping pills?

17:04.009 --> 17:06.233
I'm sorry, did I miss some...?

17:06.616 --> 17:08.140
Are you asking if my wife and I...?

17:09.731 --> 17:10.892
That is what you're asking, isn't it?

17:10.953 --> 17:12.546
Please, don't be offended.

17:12.597 --> 17:14.049
In any abduction case,

17:14.099 --> 17:18.125
it's routine to eliminate those closest to the child first.

17:19.920 --> 17:20.938
Mrs. Downey?

17:22.098 --> 17:23.406
Yes, I do, actually.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.297
I have two prescriptions at the moment.

17:26.144 --> 17:27.876
Would one of them be Zolpidem?

17:29.742 --> 17:33.233
I have no idea. I don't really know the names.

17:33.822 --> 17:36.799
I just sort of hand the slips of paper over to the pharmacist.

17:36.888 --> 17:38.610
Of course. You'll check for us?

17:38.661 --> 17:39.553
Oh, sure.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.260
How about you, Mr. Downey,? Ever take sleeping pills?

17:44.455 --> 17:45.799
I'll take one of Marilyn's occasionally.

17:46.435 --> 17:49.976
Not often. Rarely.

17:51.957 --> 17:53.112
Is this really necessary?

17:53.251 --> 17:54.670
Uh, according to your statement,

17:55.942 --> 17:57.957
you said that the night your son was abducted,

17:58.033 --> 17:59.970
you slept through the night.
Is that correct?

18:00.069 --> 18:01.951
Yes, obviously.

18:02.841 --> 18:04.242
You don't remember hearing anything?

18:05.540 --> 18:08.545
Not even when Tyler's window was being pried open with a crowbar?

18:09.151 --> 18:10.445
Isn't  all this in my statement?

18:10.705 --> 18:13.508
Would you be willing to allow us to draw a sample of your blood?

18:14.002 --> 18:17.068
It'd have to be within the next several hours to actually tell us anything.

18:17.119 --> 18:22.684
I mean, if what we're trying to do is, uh... eliminate possibilities.

18:22.885 --> 18:23.911
What possibilities?

18:24.635 --> 18:26.079
Why do you need to test my blood?

18:26.726 --> 18:29.204
To see if there's any of my prescription in there, Paul.

18:29.812 --> 18:31.014
Isn't that right, Detective?

18:33.393 --> 18:35.451
Mr. District Attorney?

18:36.467 --> 18:37.794
You folks serious?

18:38.088 --> 18:40.823
I mean, do you really think that my wife would hurt our son?

18:41.420 --> 18:45.957
No one is making any formal accusations against anyone.

18:46.064 --> 18:50.955
Again, we're simply asking for a sample of your blood in the hopes of eliminating...

18:51.006 --> 18:52.528
Well, you can't have any blood.

18:53.825 --> 18:56.601
This is insane and it's hurtful.

18:57.844 --> 19:02.040
You mean to say, if I happened to have taken a sleeping pill that night...

19:03.321 --> 19:04.596
What kind of request is that?

19:04.647 --> 19:06.070
What kind of a theory is that?

19:06.121 --> 19:07.114
We don't mean to offend you.

19:07.165 --> 19:08.803
We're simply hoping for your cooperation, sir.

19:08.968 --> 19:09.990
My cooperation?

19:10.498 --> 19:14.689
Why? So you can put off looking for the real maniac who took my son?

19:15.512 --> 19:17.218
No, I'm not doing it.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.911
I'm not going to give you an excuse not to stop

19:19.962 --> 19:22.560
that animal before he has a chance to strike again.

19:23.468 --> 19:25.063
And I want you to apologize to my wife.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.535
It doesn't matter.

19:32.821 --> 19:36.496
Okay, fine. Don't.

19:37.678 --> 19:42.415
You call us away from our son's sickbed to level these absurd accusations at us?

19:44.222 --> 19:45.359
Shame on all of you.

19:46.482 --> 19:48.586
Come on, Marilyn.
I think we need to find an attorney.

19:51.977 --> 19:54.440
You belong to your father the devil.

19:56.157 --> 19:58.303
And you want to carry out your father's desire.

20:02.108 --> 20:02.982
What did you say?

20:06.435 --> 20:09.520
It's from the Book of John. Does that ring a bell?

20:12.019 --> 20:14.009
Marilyn, come on.

20:29.733 --> 20:30.662
Pardon me.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.788
I've been waiting for the District Attorney, but I guess you'll do.

20:36.591 --> 20:39.980
I just came from the hospital. What have you people told them?

20:40.984 --> 20:44.103
Why won't they let me see my son, take him home?

20:47.529 --> 20:49.073
What, you have no answer for that?

20:50.511 --> 20:51.609
Why am I surprised?

20:52.171 --> 20:53.565
You plucked that scripture out of my head.

20:53.616 --> 20:56.721
I knew right then who you were, who you worked for.

20:57.437 --> 20:59.748
I work for  the District Attorney.

21:00.196 --> 21:06.372
And he finds it, we all find it extremely peculiar that

21:06.423 --> 21:08.147
you and your husband don't want to cooperate,

21:08.198 --> 21:10.467
don't want to help us get to the bottom of this.

21:11.338 --> 21:14.628
You are his parents, he is your child.

21:15.262 --> 21:19.899
You people don't know anything about me or my child.

21:19.950 --> 21:21.186
No, I think we do.

21:21.554 --> 21:24.520
Really? How well do you know evil?

21:25.821 --> 21:28.050
I know it when I see it. Do you?

21:28.854 --> 21:31.933
Do you know how it works? Do you know how it grows?

21:32.944 --> 21:36.209
If you carried it inside you, if you took it to your breast,

21:36.260 --> 21:39.459
lived with it every day, had it inside your house...

21:39.510 --> 21:41.437
You are talking about a child.

21:41.488 --> 21:43.005
My child.

21:44.228 --> 21:47.620
And keeping me from him is a mistake, Mrs. Dubois.

21:48.603 --> 21:50.085
I need to bring him home.

21:50.807 --> 21:53.951
And if you truly understood that piece of scripture you quoted,

21:54.885 --> 21:56.668
you would recognize the truth of that.

21:56.966 --> 22:00.177
I recognize that you are someone in the midst of a crisis,

22:00.457 --> 22:04.036
that you need help, that the evil you think is inside your son

22:04.087 --> 22:06.808
is actually inside your head.

22:07.116 --> 22:08.733
And until I am convinced otherwise,

22:09.106 --> 22:12.980
I will do everything I can to be sure that you are nowhere near Tyler.

22:37.274 --> 22:40.235
What's terrifying-- no, what's tragic--

22:40.286 --> 22:45.211
her sense of conviction is so strong, it's... so absolute.

22:47.656 --> 22:51.463
I keep thinking about all these couples who are desperate to have a child of their own,

22:51.514 --> 22:52.584
and here's this woman...

22:54.139 --> 22:58.938
completely convinced that her son must die, that he's the embodiment of evil.

22:59.705 --> 23:00.832
It makes me want to cry.

23:03.984 --> 23:05.692
So what happens now?

23:07.266 --> 23:12.180
I don't know, we can only compel the hospital to keep him in protective custody for so long.

23:14.569 --> 23:16.879
The father is blind to it all.

23:17.704 --> 23:19.397
I don't know what we can prove in court.

23:21.621 --> 23:25.967
All I know is, I have to do everything I can to keep that woman away from her son.

23:31.045 --> 23:33.168
How  old did you say he was?

23:36.154 --> 23:40.617
I don't know, he's, like... six or seven, maybe.

23:42.514 --> 23:46.877
Sweet. God, he seemed so sweet.

23:48.322 --> 23:51.171
Tyler. His name's Tyler.

23:52.918 --> 23:54.118
Tyler.

24:17.879 --> 24:22.225
In situations like this one, it's useful to ask oneself...

24:24.802 --> 24:27.432
...would you know how to spot  the seeds of resentment

24:27.638 --> 24:31.192
before they blossom into the rotten fruit of bad behavior?

24:35.435 --> 24:37.467
Tyler, don't. Tyler, please,

24:37.518 --> 24:39.176
why-why are you doing this?

24:41.108 --> 24:44.594
I don't know. Because I'm mad.

24:49.723 --> 24:50.664
Tyler.

24:54.935 --> 24:56.243
He killed them all, Joe.

24:57.190 --> 24:59.011
He was so unrepentant.

24:59.559 --> 25:02.161
It was like all the sweetness, all the innocence I saw in him,

25:02.212 --> 25:04.018
it was just... gone.

25:06.083 --> 25:08.246
Is what I'm saying making any kind of sense to you?

25:08.953 --> 25:10.539
Uh, I don't know, maybe.

25:11.222 --> 25:15.646
It's 2:45 in the morning-- nothing much makes sense to me at 2:45 in the morning.

25:16.534 --> 25:17.690
Well, forget it.

25:17.993 --> 25:20.932
I'm sorry, it was selfish of me to wake you.

25:21.141 --> 25:22.851
No, no, I'm sorry, all right?

25:23.109 --> 25:24.398
Let me just try and focus.

25:25.095 --> 25:26.495
Why don't you start from the beginning.

25:27.117 --> 25:33.373
Yesterday... I dreamt that Marilyn Downey was shooting her son in the head.

25:33.471 --> 25:35.056
Now today, I'm dreaming about Tyler,

25:35.107 --> 25:39.238
and he's in high school, and he's killing people, dozens of them.

25:39.792 --> 25:41.985
He took out a gun, and he was just slaughtering them.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.332
I-In the future?

25:44.818 --> 25:45.840
In the future.

25:50.053 --> 25:52.181
Well, maybe this kid's supposed to be a long-term project.

25:53.860 --> 25:56.852
Maybe you're supposed to help him out even after you lock his mother up.

25:58.632 --> 26:00.927
Or maybe I'm not supposed to help him at all.

26:04.494 --> 26:05.787
You can't be serious.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.190
I don't know.

26:09.226 --> 26:11.385
Maybe his mother has a touch of what I have.

26:11.821 --> 26:13.733
Maybe she's seen what I just saw.

26:14.566 --> 26:16.919
I mean, then it would make some kind of crazy sense.

26:17.380 --> 26:20.122
Then you could almost understand why she would do it,

26:20.173 --> 26:22.350
why she would feel compelled to try again.

26:23.985 --> 26:25.595
Maybe I'm not supposed to stop her.

26:26.576 --> 26:27.867
Maybe she's just crazy.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.044
Maybe what you're seeing when you dream are the dreams of a crazy woman.

26:32.168 --> 26:33.687
Maybe, but how do I know?

26:34.282 --> 26:35.561
How can I be sure?

26:35.674 --> 26:37.268
I don't want to do the wrong thing.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.032
I don't want to make the wrong decision.

26:39.258 --> 26:40.356
The wrong decision?

26:41.410 --> 26:43.041
Allison, you're not seriously suggesting

26:43.093 --> 26:46.943
that sending this kid home with his homicidal mother is an option, are you?

26:47.310 --> 26:50.363
I'm not suggesting anything. I'm just trying to figure it out.

26:50.770 --> 26:52.141
But there's nothing to figure out.

26:52.322 --> 26:54.582
This kid is in danger.

26:55.143 --> 26:57.820
He's seven years old, and he needs your help.

26:58.152 --> 26:59.505
That's all you need to know.

27:02.853 --> 27:13.228
Of course. You're right. You're right.

27:17.765 --> 27:19.209
Glad to be of assistance.

27:21.793 --> 27:27.459
Joe Dubois: husband, father, moral compass. We never close.

28:06.875 --> 28:07.986
You have a moment, sir?

28:09.037 --> 28:10.592
Allison. Sure. Come in.

28:13.448 --> 28:15.764
Hypothetically, what would you say

28:15.815 --> 28:19.851
if I told you I came across a piece of evidence that might help us

28:19.902 --> 28:22.495
nail Marilyn Downey for the attempted murder of her son?

28:25.715 --> 28:28.241
Hypothetically, I'd tell you that I'm a very happy man.

28:28.634 --> 28:32.618
What would you say if I told youI'd been having dreams about the little boy we're trying to save?

28:33.735 --> 28:37.390
What if I told you that he may grow up to become one of the most evil human beings

28:37.480 --> 28:38.938
you or I have ever known,

28:39.379 --> 28:42.467
and that by stopping his mother from committing an atrocity in the present,

28:42.923 --> 28:47.416
we may very well be setting the stage for an even greater atrocity in the future?

28:48.863 --> 28:50.339
What would you say then?

28:58.658 --> 29:02.911
I'd tell you that you're giving me more information than I need to do my job.

29:05.149 --> 29:08.684
I'd tell you that we have a responsibility to take care of the case that's right in front of us:

29:08.848 --> 29:10.942
saving this child from his very deranged parent.

29:11.463 --> 29:13.492
What if this child grows up to hurt other children?

29:14.339 --> 29:15.509
What if he becomes a killer?

29:16.212 --> 29:18.949
I'd remind you that we have almost a decade to try and stop him.

29:21.413 --> 29:24.763
Let's first worry about protecting Tyler Downey from his mother.

29:25.173 --> 29:27.736
Then we'll figure out a way to protect society from Tyler Downey.

29:44.734 --> 29:47.702
- Tell me!
- Tell you what?

29:48.012 --> 29:50.737
Tell me how high you're gonna put that sign on the door.

29:51.009 --> 29:53.424
And I asked you, how tall are you?

29:53.893 --> 29:59.290
Mom! Tell her she can't keep me out of her room just because I'm littler than she is!

30:00.126 --> 30:02.923
There are no height requirements in the Dubois house, Ariel.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.030
I'm still putting it on my door.

30:18.314 --> 30:19.196
Hello?

30:19.549 --> 30:20.490
It's me, Allison.

30:20.541 --> 30:22.644
Just wanted to let you know that I heard from forensics.

30:22.974 --> 30:23.661
And?

30:24.322 --> 30:27.732
While the gun you found was unmistakably the one used to shoot Tyler Downey,

30:28.009 --> 30:29.187
it's never been registered,

30:29.717 --> 30:32.800
and was thoroughly cleaned before it was left at that dump site.

30:33.486 --> 30:37.037
There simply are no prints or DNA evidence.

30:37.562 --> 30:39.763
So there's no way to trace it back to Marilyn.

30:40.544 --> 30:41.986
I'm afraid that's not the worst of it.

30:44.098 --> 30:45.603
The Downeys went back to court this morning,

30:45.673 --> 30:48.848
and the judge ruled that as soon as Tyler is feeling up to it,

30:49.085 --> 30:51.083
he's to be released into his parents' care.

30:52.877 --> 30:55.669
They left the hospital together at 5:20 this afternoon.

30:57.556 --> 31:01.087
So how long do you think it'll be till we get the call that she finally killed him?

31:02.894 --> 31:07.563
Allison, I think we've made it abundantly clear to Mrs. Downey that we're watching her,

31:07.614 --> 31:09.108
that we'll always be watching her.

31:09.970 --> 31:11.447
Well, that's fine and good, sir...

31:11.968 --> 31:12.788
But?

31:12.949 --> 31:15.234
I just don't know how much that means to a crazy person.

31:33.533 --> 31:36.027
Where do the leaders of tomorrow come from?

31:36.435 --> 31:43.034
The seeds of their success are sown here in the halls of high schools all across American.

31:45.391 --> 31:47.943
Let's listen in on one such success story.

31:49.588 --> 31:56.242
And before we award you your diplomas, let's hear a word from our valedictorian, Tyler Downey.

32:12.446 --> 32:17.344
In the days leading up to graduation, a number of people have asked me:

32:17.723 --> 32:24.442
"Is there one person or one event that has inspired you through your high school career?"

32:25.815 --> 32:30.141
For me, the person who made the biggest difference was my mom.

32:33.243 --> 32:36.941
- Wow.
- Hmm?

32:38.792 --> 32:41.722
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32:43.321 --> 32:49.117
Actually I am okay. And I think everything's gonna be okay.

33:00.543 --> 33:01.643
I didn't... Good morning.

33:01.694 --> 33:02.648
I didn't mean to frighten you.

33:02.699 --> 33:05.698
I was just wondering if... if I could have a word.

33:06.422 --> 33:09.066
"A word"? Talk?

33:09.757 --> 33:11.047
Is that really necessary?

33:11.803 --> 33:13.644
Isn't a talk really beside the point?

33:13.822 --> 33:14.915
I don't think so.

33:16.142 --> 33:18.104
For one thing, I am not who you think I am.

33:18.155 --> 33:22.049
In fact, I am probably much more like you than you think.

33:23.193 --> 33:24.425
What do you mean?

33:25.310 --> 33:32.566
You have had dreams about Tyler.  About his future. So have I.

33:35.406 --> 33:38.034
- I don't believe you.
- It's true.

33:39.016 --> 33:40.922
That's how I knew about you, about the dump.

33:40.973 --> 33:44.574
That's how I knew about the Scripture that you quoted, right before you shot him.

33:45.457 --> 33:49.341
John. Chapter eight. Verse 44. I dreamt it.

33:50.774 --> 33:53.560
I dreamt the other dreams thatyou had about Tyler growing up,

33:53.611 --> 33:56.829
about high school... about the killings.

33:58.829 --> 34:06.133
I came here... this morning, to tell you your dreams are wrong.

34:06.903 --> 34:09.016
Tyler doesn't have to grow up to be a killer.

34:09.068 --> 34:13.329
He can be a... an incredible boy, an incredible man.

34:15.266 --> 34:18.451
The key... is you.

34:19.520 --> 34:22.685
You are the one that makes it possible.

34:23.496 --> 34:24.606
I have seen it.

34:28.342 --> 34:31.856
No No.

34:33.187 --> 34:38.368
I know what I know. I know what I feel.

34:39.041 --> 34:40.304
This is a trick.

34:40.934 --> 34:43.842
You are a demon, and this is a trick.

34:44.650 --> 34:50.465
No, I am no demon. And there is no trick.

34:52.310 --> 34:54.193
This is a miracle.

34:55.565 --> 34:59.990
This is a second chance, and they come very rarely.

35:01.714 --> 35:04.242
Look. I know what you did in that dump.

35:04.957 --> 35:06.083
But you know what?

35:06.377 --> 35:10.022
No one else does. No one else in the whole wide world.

35:10.450 --> 35:13.880
Most especially, not your son.

35:15.243 --> 35:19.275
Just you, me and God.

35:21.868 --> 35:28.783
So I guess why I was sent here, why I'm here is to tell you none of it matters.

35:29.561 --> 35:36.184
It can all be wiped away right here, right now,

35:37.616 --> 35:41.336
if you choose it, if you believe it,

35:42.689 --> 35:46.207
if you can see Tyler for the incredible boy he really is.

35:53.749 --> 35:59.154
Oh... Oh, my God.

36:00.446 --> 36:02.478
You're an angel, aren't you?

36:03.829 --> 36:04.740
No.

36:06.194 --> 36:15.057
I'm just a woman who knows about something horrible and who is willing to forget about it.

36:18.627 --> 36:20.062
If you're willing.

36:35.737 --> 36:37.922
She looks awfully comfortable, doesn't she?

36:43.069 --> 36:44.562
House is all locked up.

36:46.836 --> 36:48.890
Ariel finally turned her light out.

36:52.239 --> 36:54.556
It's like she's slept there her whole life.

36:58.530 --> 37:02.292
Well, I guess she was getting a little big for that crib, wasn't she?

37:02.595 --> 37:04.050
Maybe just a hair.

37:08.150 --> 37:09.390
You ready for bed?

37:12.381 --> 37:13.793
We're lucky, aren't we?

37:15.457 --> 37:18.674
Three amazing kids. We did all right.

37:20.399 --> 37:24.813
"Did"? As in past tense? Hmm? As in we're done?

37:26.001 --> 37:27.221
Mm...

37:27.864 --> 37:29.409
The truth is, I don't know.

37:30.246 --> 37:31.509
What's that expression?

37:32.026 --> 37:33.720
"It ain't over till it's over "?

37:41.459 --> 37:42.779
Shh... Hello?

37:42.964 --> 37:44.670
Allison, I'm sorry to wake you.

37:45.646 --> 37:48.611
It's okay. What's the matter? What's... what's up?

37:48.789 --> 37:51.103
I just got a call from the chief of police.

37:51.722 --> 37:53.243
Sometime around 11:00 this evening,

37:53.294 --> 37:56.253
Marilyn Downey swallowed two fistfuls of sleeping pills.

37:57.076 --> 37:59.119
She was pronounced dead about half an hour ago.

38:00.069 --> 38:03.692
No, no. No, that... that's, that's wrong.

38:03.743 --> 38:04.823
I had a dream.

38:05.703 --> 38:09.549
He turned out to be a really great kid, and she was a big part of that.

38:09.938 --> 38:11.115
He mentioned her...

38:11.166 --> 38:15.758
I, uh... I don't know what to tell you.

38:15.809 --> 38:17.253
I don't really know what you're talking about.

38:17.967 --> 38:21.614
Marilyn Downey is dead. Just thought you'd want to know.

38:22.910 --> 38:24.475
I actually thought that you'd be relieved.

38:25.078 --> 38:25.923
I mean...

38:26.663 --> 38:30.302
This may be a horrible thing to say, but at least the boy is safe now.

38:32.313 --> 38:33.218
Allison?

38:34.486 --> 38:36.021
It's okay. I-I just thought...

38:39.042 --> 38:44.335
I guess I hoped... that things would turn out differently.

38:48.514 --> 38:49.932
I guess I'll see you in the morning.

38:50.382 --> 38:51.531
See you in the morning.

38:56.771 --> 38:58.314
In the days leading up to graduation,

38:58.677 --> 39:01.184
a number of people have asked me:

39:02.007 --> 39:08.814
"Is there one person or one event that has inspired you through your high school career?"

39:10.487 --> 39:14.212
For me, the person who made the biggest difference was my mom.

39:19.093 --> 39:21.338
My dad likes to tell me how devoted she was to me.

39:23.088 --> 39:27.084
Actually, "obsessed" is the word he often uses to describe it.

39:30.527 --> 39:34.845
We don't talk about it much, but when I was seven,

39:36.191 --> 39:41.170
a stranger came into  my bedroom and drugged me and shot me and left me for dead.

39:44.038 --> 39:45.316
I barely remember the experience,

39:45.380 --> 39:51.402
but, apparently, my mother was devastated by it and felt somehow responsible.

39:55.763 --> 40:00.166
She never forgave herself and apparently consumed by guilt and depression,

40:02.236 --> 40:05.023
she took her own life shortly thereafter.

40:10.095 --> 40:12.333
I do remember how badly people felt for me,

40:14.173 --> 40:17.220
how concerned everyone was that I would grow up without a mother.

40:19.510 --> 40:23.157
But I'm here to tell you that not a day goes by that I don't think of her,

40:24.874 --> 40:28.782
not a day goes by... that I don't feel her here with me.

40:32.149 --> 40:37.389
And not a day goes by that I'm not reminded of how fleeting life is,

40:38.938 --> 40:40.861
how much it is that we have to get done

40:42.179 --> 40:44.420
and how important it is that we do it well.

40:45.633 --> 40:49.274
Thanks, Mom. I've tried to make you proud.

40:59.398 --> 41:04.525
