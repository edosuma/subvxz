02:16.120 --> 02:18.560
- Was it 205?
- 205th

02:24.120 --> 02:26.240
What the hell, man?

02:27.560 --> 02:29.240
(Yelling)

02:29.400 --> 02:31.440
Keep your mouth shut!

02:32.800 --> 02:36.440
Fucking ...!
Sit down!

02:40.800 --> 02:43.200
- What?
- Tristan?

02:47.040 --> 02:49.200
Who the hell are you?

02:50.840 --> 02:55.960
- Did you call the cops?
- They should not be fucking here!

02:56.120 --> 02:58.920
Are you good now? Are you happy?

02:59.080 --> 03:02.640
Why don't we just talk?
What are you doing out here in the country?

03:02.800 --> 03:05.520
I live here.
What are you doing here?

03:05.680 --> 03:09.360
- What's wrong? What is this?
- It's not shit.

03:09.520 --> 03:13.040
- Have you used your own shit?
- Fuck, you're a fagot.

03:13.200 --> 03:17.360
If it is to have the elf in there, take him.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.280
He didn't do anything. Fuck off!

03:21.000 --> 03:23.720
What the hell?
You smashed down my door!

03:23.880 --> 03:26.600
Now sit down
and relax.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.920
- You ruined my door, man!
- Sit down.

03:30.080 --> 03:34.520
- Do you have a warrant?
- What's in there? Move.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.400
- Don't!
- Go to the kitchen!

03:43.560 --> 03:45.600
This is my apartment.

03:45.760 --> 03:50.280
- Simon. We need some assistance.
- I told you to sit down.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.720
The police are here.
They have broken into our apartment.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.480
- Andreas!
- Don't, man!

03:56.640 --> 03:59.160
Don't do that!

04:00.400 --> 04:05.400
- Let me go! Ouch!
- Now don't move!

04:05.560 --> 04:08.480
- I got him.
- Damn!

04:08.640 --> 04:11.720
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

04:11.880 --> 04:15.480
- Is that your child?
- It is ours, fucking cunt!

04:15.640 --> 04:18.680
You have a young Tristan?
This is a joke.

04:18.839 --> 04:21.160
Come here, little buddy.

04:22.680 --> 04:26.000
Sh. Up with you.
Sh sh.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.720
- Give him to me.
- Stop. Sit down.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.000
Sit down, I said!

04:33.160 --> 04:35.880
- What's your name?
- Sanne.

04:37.320 --> 04:41.200
- Why do you have a child with a psychopath?
- What's it to you, man?

04:41.360 --> 04:44.160
- Are you a junkie? What?
- No.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.480
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

04:50.760 --> 04:54.480
He is also ice cold.
Give him some damn clothes.

04:56.240 --> 04:59.320
- Give him to me now.
- And you?

04:59.480 --> 05:01.520
- No.
- No?

05:02.480 --> 05:06.400
- Do you have infant formula?
- Tristan drank it.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.560
Shut up, bitch!

05:10.240 --> 05:13.440
- So.
- Now give him to me. Give him to me!

05:13.600 --> 05:15.680
Give him to me.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.360
(Baby crying)
Yes, it's not funny.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.560
- Hi there.
- Give him to me.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.360
(Baby crying)

05:48.520 --> 05:51.680
- Hello!
- Hi, honey.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.480
Oh, how nice.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.640
Hey, little man. Hello.

06:04.040 --> 06:07.600
- Why did you call?
- You have been so strong.

06:07.760 --> 06:12.880
- It was stupid. Sorry.
- It's okay. But it was weird.

06:13.040 --> 06:17.480
There was some trouble in an apartment.
One guy I had arrested in Copenhagen.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.440
And then it turns out,
he's got a little boy.

06:26.840 --> 06:30.840
This baby was covered
in his own shit and piss. Ice cold.

06:32.520 --> 06:37.360
And then I just...
So I wanted to call you.

06:40.320 --> 06:44.200
Yes, I did.
You are just about to fall asleep.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.560
You're so fine.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.040
(Baby whining)
Oh, are you mad now?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.280
(Baby crying)

07:25.040 --> 07:28.440
- I'll drive with him.
- No, I will.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.560
Shh.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.680
- Shouldn't I come with you?
- No, you go to sleep.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.080
You gotta get your pacifier.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.080
(Baby crying)

08:37.000 --> 08:41.400
Shh, shh. Shh, shh.

08:41.559 --> 08:45.800
There. It's all right. So.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.680
So. It's all right.

08:58.280 --> 09:01.760
You just wanted to go for a ride
so you can fall asleep.

09:18.200 --> 09:22.080
When your child is otherwise sound and healthy,
it can't be forced to be taken away.

09:22.240 --> 09:25.440
It looked like shit!
They're junkies!

09:27.440 --> 09:29.920
Her drug test is negative.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.160
Why were we not announced that
Tristan was released?

09:33.320 --> 09:37.760
Because he has a registered address
in VÃ¦rebroparken.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.440
Otherwise they had informed.
He is out on three years probation.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.840
- We better know it.
- He is not listed as the father.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.560
Only because there is no child support
was to retrieve.

09:49.520 --> 09:53.080
Now see what he usually does to his girls.

09:53.240 --> 09:59.080
The man must be locked up again. The child should
be taken away. The man is the star psychopath.

09:59.240 --> 10:04.400
We need something on him.
He will end up beating them both to death.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.440
- Andreas?
- Yes.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.840
- Is Simon free?
- Yes, it's his son's birthday.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.120
He's at a restaurant with 
Trine and her new husband.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.200
- It is, isn't it?
- We must see.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.080
Come on, man! Hey!

10:28.560 --> 10:31.520
Is it okay if
I have a drink?

10:35.240 --> 10:37.320
What's up, man?

10:38.680 --> 10:42.440
It is a good scheme.
I can get rid of your dirty money.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.480
Then I can get a free drink.
That's okay. Isn't it?

10:46.640 --> 10:48.920
Isn't it a good system?

10:49.080 --> 10:53.240
- You know, they all are gay?
- Is it true?

10:53.400 --> 10:55.960
- What's your name?
- Pamela.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.480
They are all gay.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.600
Come on, dammit.
I just need a drink.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.840
(Baby crying)

11:14.160 --> 11:17.040
- I'm going.
- No, you go to sleep.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.120
(Mobile buzz)

11:35.320 --> 11:37.920
- Hello?
<I> - Andreas? </ I>

11:38.080 --> 11:41.120
- Who is it?
<I> - Klaus from Dollhouse. Listen. </ I>

11:41.280 --> 11:44.440
<I> Simon drank a lot. </ I>

11:51.080 --> 11:54.560
I have to run.
It is Simon. You know how it is.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.440
- Should I go with you?
- Take Alexander to the strip club?

11:58.600 --> 12:00.640
I'll skip that.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.440
- What do you want?
- Is this your...

12:25.600 --> 12:27.680
Where is he?

12:27.840 --> 12:30.040
Whoa, whoa! Stop!

12:30.200 --> 12:31.920
Stop!

12:32.080 --> 12:35.400
Get down!
Sit down.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.240
Okay? It ends here.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.920
- I have got him.
- We'll sit down and have a drink.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.080
Boy, look at this.
It's damn disgusting, Simon.

12:53.240 --> 12:57.600
- Why didn't you buy a stove?
- I don't cook.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.480
Albert won't get past if it looks like this.

13:01.640 --> 13:05.920
Albert does not come here anyway.
He's with his swim teacher.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.120
How was the dinner?
Did you say something stupid?

13:09.280 --> 13:14.000
I didn't fucking say anything stupid.
I sat there and smiled for four hours.

13:15.520 --> 13:19.440
Friendly and all that
to his swim teacher.

13:19.600 --> 13:22.960
Although we have talked about
not giving him something big -

13:23.120 --> 13:26.720
- He gives him an iPhone.
And I'm coming with football gloves.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.480
Don't feel sorry for yourself. Take your coffee.

13:30.640 --> 13:34.960
Swim Teacher, that's no damn
job. Anyone can be a swim teacher.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.320
Simon. You will have to
to go to sleep now.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.200
I may as well be a swimming instructor,
if that's what.

13:42.360 --> 13:45.960
I can do a damn good splash-around out there
from eight to four.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.520
You can still get three hours of sleep.

13:49.440 --> 13:53.280
You will need to take
your shit together. Stay off the booze.

13:55.600 --> 14:00.840
You can also go out on the island to my mother's
cabin, if you like.

14:04.120 --> 14:07.920
I'm on the toilet.
And I'll have a glass of milk.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.120
No, no.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.680
(Simon belches)

15:09.840 --> 15:11.560
Try to see.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.240
It is quite sick, man.

15:18.320 --> 15:21.520
He can wear
it for confirmation. Perfect.

15:21.680 --> 15:25.880
Typical mother. It is easier
to send something than to get even.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.840
- Is he sleeping?
- Yes. He's sleeping

15:37.680 --> 15:39.560
Good night.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.160
I can't believe he's here.

16:05.080 --> 16:09.520
Imagine that we have him now.
I still havn't grasped it.

16:09.680 --> 16:13.560
I think he is good
in drawing the attention to himself.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.640
Do you regret it?

16:18.640 --> 16:20.960
Why do you say that?

16:23.320 --> 16:27.200
Why do you say that? I love him.
He is the most important thing in my life.

16:27.360 --> 16:31.400
- Why would you say such a thing ?!
- Anna, Anna ...

16:31.560 --> 16:35.360
I just meant,
it's a bit harder than we thought.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.240
Sorry.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.800
(Baby crying)

16:52.960 --> 16:55.960
(She sighs)
(Both laugh)

16:57.200 --> 16:59.240
(Baby crying)

17:25.040 --> 17:28.200
- I'm getting ready here.
- Sonny must have food.

17:28.359 --> 17:32.560
Do not touch him.
He is fine there. I mean it.

17:32.720 --> 17:37.360
- He'll just start crying.
- He is fine. Do you hear me?

17:37.520 --> 17:40.160
(Loud yelp)
I'll take him.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.160
Sanne! Put him down.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.320
Sanne ...

17:55.200 --> 17:57.800
Shh, shh.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.680
- Make him.
- He's hungry.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.880
What is it
you fucking do not understand?

18:04.040 --> 18:07.520
- He must have food.
- Well, must he have some food?

18:07.680 --> 18:11.720
Have I asked you to go here?
Do you hear what I say?

18:13.600 --> 18:17.160
So then, tax,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.960
No, it's not there. Come on.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.240
Yes, that's not good either.
Shut up.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.640
Stay there. You will be there.
I mean it.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.120
(Baby crying loudly)

18:36.600 --> 18:38.800
So ...

18:38.960 --> 18:42.600
Yes. Shh, shh.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.120
- Come on.
- He must have some milk.

18:52.280 --> 18:55.360
Come on. Come here.

18:56.360 --> 18:59.360
Come on.
You there!

19:00.160 --> 19:04.080
- Stay down!
- I do not have anything!

19:04.240 --> 19:08.200
You will be there,
or I fucking pans you one.

19:08.360 --> 19:12.000
(Baby crying)
So ... so.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.240
Stay down!

19:19.720 --> 19:22.680
Yes. Well, it's sweet.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.720
So ...

20:59.560 --> 21:01.800
No, no, no.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.920
No, no, no.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.640
Wake up. Wake up.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.920
Wake up now, come on.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.680
Wake up! Wake up.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.400
Wake up. Wake up.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.240
No! Wake up!

21:33.000 --> 21:35.400
- Wake up.
- Anna?

21:36.680 --> 21:40.320
- Anna?
- No!

21:41.600 --> 21:43.480
Anna?

21:44.480 --> 21:46.480
Move away!

21:51.120 --> 21:52.720
Do something.

21:55.400 --> 21:59.120
Do something.
Just do something!

22:00.160 --> 22:03.640
- Do something!
- Call an ambulance.

22:28.320 --> 22:32.760
Anna, call an ambulance.
You must call an ambulance.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.360
If you call,
they'll take him away.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.920
- He's dead, Anna.
- Why do you say that?

23:18.920 --> 23:21.680
- You are insane.
- He's dead.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.240
We need to call.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.960
- No phone calls.
- I have to call.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.680
No.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.360
- Anna, he ...
- No !!

23:37.960 --> 23:40.960
I have to call.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.520
If they take him,
I'll kill myself!

23:49.440 --> 23:51.680
- Anna?
- No!

23:51.840 --> 23:54.600
- Anna, come here.
- No!

23:55.920 --> 23:58.880
- No!
- Anna, sit down!

24:00.160 --> 24:02.240
- No phone calls.
- No.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.240
If they take him,
I'll kill myself!

24:08.560 --> 24:11.640
I will kill myself. I mean it.

24:12.640 --> 24:15.640
- I mean it.
- I understand.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.320
Want some food?

24:35.200 --> 24:36.880
Come on.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.800
Come on.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.280
Eat a little.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.200
Eat something.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.240
Anna?

25:01.240 --> 25:05.440
- Come on.
- You need to get some sleep, honey.

25:05.600 --> 25:09.320
You just ...
You must take these pills, honey.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.080
So you can sleep.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.480
- Here.
- Thank you.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.720
It's all right. Drink.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.520
Here.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.720
- No phone calls.
- I won't call.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.720
You must sleep.

25:44.400 --> 25:48.320
- No phone calls, right?
- I won't call. I promise.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.480
Thank you.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.200
He won't eat.

28:26.760 --> 28:29.560
(Mobile buzzing)

28:38.640 --> 28:41.840
<I> Leave a message after the beep. </ I>

29:36.240 --> 29:38.200
(Baby crying)

29:55.000 --> 29:57.080
Shh, shh.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.120
(Rattle)

30:40.320 --> 30:42.200
(Andreas crying)

31:25.280 --> 31:27.120
(Honking)

31:47.240 --> 31:50.840
(Andreas screaming and crying)
(Baby crying)

32:06.720 --> 32:08.880
My little treasure.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.400
(Infant babble)

33:15.320 --> 33:18.720
- Alexander?
- It is not Alexander.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.960
It's another baby.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.440
- Alex ...
- It is not him.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.000
Ok.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.960
I have taken their child.

33:56.920 --> 34:00.080
Those people that I've talked about.
Tristan.

34:06.480 --> 34:09.679
I left Alexander there.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.199
I have taken him.

34:24.400 --> 34:27.080
- I want Alexander.
- He's dead.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.760
- He's dead.
- Where is he?

34:30.800 --> 34:33.080
He has died, Anna.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.840
We don't have a child anymore.

34:53.360 --> 34:56.080
We don't have Alexander anymore.

35:01.160 --> 35:04.200
I want Alexander.
Where is he?

35:05.920 --> 35:07.800
Where is he?

36:17.640 --> 36:19.640
(Humming)

36:26.240 --> 36:28.840
Hey, Sonny. Sonny?

36:33.840 --> 36:35.400
Sonny.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.120
Hey! Hey!

36:54.800 --> 36:56.920
Sanne!

36:57.080 --> 36:59.000
Sonny? Sonny?

37:03.120 --> 37:05.280
Come on. Sanne!

37:06.840 --> 37:09.320
- Sanne, come here!
- Yes. Relax.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.360
Come, come, come.
Sanne, come on!

37:12.560 --> 37:14.480
Sonny. Sonny.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.960
- Sanne!
- Yes. Calm down.

37:17.120 --> 37:21.160
Try and take him up. Check whether he is breathing.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.200
Of course, he's breathing.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.040
- What the hell, man ?!
- Is he breathing?

37:31.200 --> 37:34.680
- What the hell have you done?
- Check if he is breathing.

37:34.840 --> 37:38.240
He draws breath?
(She cries)

37:38.400 --> 37:41.040
Check if he's breathing.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.080
What the hell?
You fucking killed him.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.960
Fuck!

37:51.400 --> 37:54.440
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
We are going to jail.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.800
We are both going to jail.
It's fucking lie.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.840
Fuck, fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

38:28.320 --> 38:29.920
Sh.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.680
It is not fair.

38:38.920 --> 38:43.800
It is not right that we get to
lose Alexander, and they get to destroy him.

38:46.520 --> 38:49.640
You can't
lose a child, Anna.

38:49.800 --> 38:54.160
I lost him.
Alexander is still dead.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.360
Right?

39:07.680 --> 39:13.000
You said,
that you would kill yourself. No?

39:14.200 --> 39:17.440
You said,
that you would kill yourself.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.360
When I met you, you said -

39:34.520 --> 39:38.240
- That the only thing you ever wanted,
was to have a child.

39:41.760 --> 39:43.760
He's ours now.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.360
<I> Simon? </ I>

40:44.160 --> 40:48.680
<I> I need your help.
Call as soon as you hear my message. </ I>

40:54.400 --> 40:57.200
(Cell phone rings)
Hello, Simon.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.480
Hello.

41:04.680 --> 41:06.720
Everything is fine.

41:08.920 --> 41:11.920
- What do you mean?
- The message that you've left.

41:12.080 --> 41:14.800
You sounded
as if you've seen a ghost.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.840
<I> I was just ...
Everything's all right now. </ I>

41:18.000 --> 41:20.920
Are you sure?
Is Anna okay? Alexander?

41:21.080 --> 41:23.800
<I> Yes, yes. Anna is doing fine. </ I>

41:23.960 --> 41:26.760
Should I just come over?

41:52.720 --> 41:54.680
Sonny is not dead!

41:55.600 --> 41:58.240
- What are you doing?
- He is not dead!

41:58.400 --> 42:01.600
- Shut up, shut up.
- Sonny is not dead!

42:05.040 --> 42:08.240
(She cries)
Shut up.

42:09.480 --> 42:12.280
Shut up.
Do you hear what I say?

42:14.960 --> 42:18.640
If you shout again,
I'll cut your throat.

42:19.520 --> 42:22.040
Do you hear what I say?

42:27.480 --> 42:31.360
Yes, it is good. It's good. So.

42:44.440 --> 42:48.080
- It is not Sonny.
- Keep your fucking mouth shut.

42:48.240 --> 42:51.720
They seem different,
when they are dead, man!

42:53.160 --> 42:56.120
- It's Sonny!
- Listen.

42:56.280 --> 42:58.920
I won't go back.

42:59.080 --> 43:03.040
I'm not going back and do time
because of you. Do you understand?

43:03.200 --> 43:07.000
We have to do something.
I have a plan, okay?

43:09.080 --> 43:13.920
And we follow through with it.
Trust me, baby. Okay.

43:15.600 --> 43:19.640
Let him go now. Let him go.
Come on, baby. Come, come.

43:21.840 --> 43:23.960
That's great, honey.

43:31.120 --> 43:34.680
Huh?
(Sings)

43:44.560 --> 43:48.760
- What was that?
- They haven't reported it yet.

43:48.920 --> 43:52.000
- Why not?
- Because they just don't care.

43:52.160 --> 43:54.560
They are safe and sound.

43:54.720 --> 43:58.240
- Someone will find out.
- There's nothing to find out.

43:58.400 --> 44:02.720
They will never suspect us.
Come here. Here.

44:06.720 --> 44:11.920
It is no crime. It would
it be if Tristan have smashed him.

44:12.920 --> 44:15.440
We're going to save him.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.040
I know it's hard to see that now.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.360
We do something.

44:40.040 --> 44:42.080
(The banks)

44:44.040 --> 44:46.400
Oh, damn.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.440
- Hello, Simon.
- Hello.

44:54.480 --> 44:58.800
- May I come in?
- No. Lets just go out.

44:58.960 --> 45:01.760
- You sounded strange on the phone.
- Everything is fine.

45:01.920 --> 45:04.720
- I can see that it's not.
- Go now.

45:04.880 --> 45:08.200
I won't go anywhere. You look like shit.

45:10.480 --> 45:13.760
It is Anna.
She is not feeling well.

45:15.640 --> 45:19.320
I have to go back to her, okay?

45:19.480 --> 45:21.000
We'll see.

45:21.160 --> 45:24.240
- Let me know if there's anything.
- Yes, yes.

45:26.400 --> 45:29.160
Did you say that there was something wrong with me?

45:31.680 --> 45:36.200
Why the hell
would you say that there's something wrong with me?

45:36.360 --> 45:38.720
- Sorry.
- Stop it!

45:38.880 --> 45:43.440
It's fucking not me,
there is something wrong with! It is you!

45:43.600 --> 45:45.400
It is you.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.800
Anna?

46:00.920 --> 46:03.880
Hello, you. Hello.

46:05.520 --> 46:07.000
So.

46:08.720 --> 46:12.280
Maybe we should ask your parents
to come and help?

46:12.440 --> 46:16.080
- They still wouldn't come.
- No.

46:21.760 --> 46:26.000
I must go to work and find out
why they didn't report it.

46:27.200 --> 46:30.200
So Alexander is just there.

46:36.240 --> 46:39.200
I wish I could be there.

46:40.360 --> 46:42.880
I will not be a mother.

46:45.680 --> 46:48.880
- Come on.
- I don't think I'm supposed to.

46:50.640 --> 46:53.280
I miss Alexander.

46:57.040 --> 46:59.120
I do too.

47:32.640 --> 47:35.200
Huh? Huh?

47:35.960 --> 47:37.440
Hello.

47:41.800 --> 47:45.800
Should we turn around here?
So we can take a nap.

47:46.800 --> 47:49.800
Should you have a little nap?

47:57.160 --> 47:59.800
Excuse me? Hey! Do you have a light?

48:04.600 --> 48:06.960
Thank you. Hello.

48:09.240 --> 48:12.520
Yes? What?

48:14.800 --> 48:19.160
From whom?
No, damn it! It's fucking lie!

48:25.120 --> 48:26.840
Hey!

48:29.480 --> 48:32.000
Hey! Hey!

48:33.840 --> 48:36.720
- What happened?
- He ran away with Sonny!

48:36.880 --> 48:39.640
- He ran away with my son!
- Who?

48:39.800 --> 48:43.120
Call the police! Hey! Hey!

48:44.720 --> 48:48.680
No! Come back!
Come back!

48:56.160 --> 48:59.680
I have to ask about it.
Is Anna okay?

49:02.280 --> 49:04.680
- What's the matter?
- Hold up.

49:04.840 --> 49:10.840
<I> A baby of seven weeks has disappeared
on a playground at Solbakken. </ i>

49:11.000 --> 49:13.560
Station 5 here. We are on the way.

49:13.720 --> 49:15.520
(Siren)

49:30.720 --> 49:34.160
Good morning. As you can see,
We have closed off the area.

49:34.320 --> 49:37.880
- He ran that way.
- Is it those who have lost a child?

49:38.040 --> 49:41.160
We can cancel the barrier.
No, Tristan?

49:41.320 --> 49:44.080
- What did you say?
- We don't need a barrier.

49:44.240 --> 49:47.840
He does not believe a damn thing I'm saying.
I stand there talking on my phone.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.880
A guy comes running,
takes my son and runs in that direction.

49:52.040 --> 49:56.000
I get them to call.
And I run down to a parked car.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.400
I couldn't see the plates.

49:58.560 --> 50:01.600
- He looked Eastern European.
- Shut up.

50:01.760 --> 50:05.600
- I run after him ...
- Hey, hey. Wait right here.

50:05.760 --> 50:08.200
Look at me, Sanne.

50:08.360 --> 50:11.000
Look at me.
Where is Sonny?

50:11.160 --> 50:13.200
Someone took him.

50:13.360 --> 50:17.600
- Where is Sonny?
- Someone has taken him, dammit!

50:19.920 --> 50:23.840
Someone has taken him?
You didn't just forget him somewhere?

50:30.720 --> 50:33.960
Tristan.
Tristan, come here.

50:34.120 --> 50:36.360
- What?
- Come here.

50:36.520 --> 50:40.160
- I know that you are lying.
- What are you talking about?

50:40.320 --> 50:43.280
Tell me,
where did you hide the child.

50:43.440 --> 50:47.880
- My son has been kidnapped.
- Tell me. Where is he?

50:48.040 --> 50:52.760
- I said, I ran after ...
- What the hell have you done to him?

50:54.240 --> 50:58.120
- Hey, hey!
- You got a fucking problem?

50:59.240 --> 51:01.600
Now relax, okay?

51:05.600 --> 51:08.360
- Sorry.
- What the hell's wrong with you?

51:08.520 --> 51:11.480
It just seems absurd.

51:11.640 --> 51:14.880
- We can't know that for sure.
- You can tell he's lying.

51:15.040 --> 51:18.600
I know damn well he's lying.
Quiet, right?

51:20.160 --> 51:23.920
So let us take her.
I can break her in two seconds.

51:32.520 --> 51:35.080
-

51:38.280 --> 51:40.480
What have you done with him?

51:40.640 --> 51:44.560
Don't bother.
We know he hasn't been kidnapped.

51:44.720 --> 51:48.120
We are not idiots.
You've lied to us the whole time.

51:48.280 --> 51:51.200
How have you done with him?

51:51.360 --> 51:54.160
Is he dead?
Have you killed him?

51:56.800 --> 52:00.080
- He is not dead.
- Where is he then?

52:02.320 --> 52:06.040
- He is not dead.
- What have you done to Sonny, Sanne?

52:06.200 --> 52:09.600
- It is not him.
- What have you done to Sonny?

52:09.760 --> 52:14.000
- It is not him.
- "It's not him," you say.

52:14.160 --> 52:16.480
Who was it?

52:16.640 --> 52:20.160
We don't think that
you did anything to Sonny.

52:20.320 --> 52:24.120
If something has happened to Sonny,
it doens't have to be your fault.

52:24.280 --> 52:29.240
If you let Tristan do something stupid
with him, we can't help you.

52:29.400 --> 52:34.520
I think there're enough people like me
who have children. I am a bad mother.

52:34.680 --> 52:37.880
But I have never
harmed him.

52:41.400 --> 52:45.360
Yes, I think you're a bad mother.
You should never have had children.

52:45.520 --> 52:49.840
As of me, you can rot
in prison. It depends on you.

52:56.680 --> 53:00.040
I could feel it
if he was dead. He is not dead.

54:14.520 --> 54:16.360
- Hello!
- Hello.

54:27.360 --> 54:29.080
Wow.

54:32.320 --> 54:37.080
My parents can not come for Christmas,
if the food is not in order.

54:37.240 --> 54:39.840
So it is a rehearsal dinner.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.560
Banquet.

54:43.720 --> 54:46.960
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

54:49.760 --> 54:52.400
Sit. Lets eat.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.480
Hi there. Hello.

54:56.800 --> 54:59.360
- Are you awake?
- Andreas ...

55:03.400 --> 55:08.800
We'll make it work.
It will be OK.

55:49.440 --> 55:51.400
Anna?

55:53.360 --> 55:54.960
Anna?

56:42.200 --> 56:45.080
What happened?
Did something happen?

56:46.840 --> 56:49.160
Please take him.

56:51.960 --> 56:57.200
Take him. He must be cold.
He cried so much, so I took him up.

56:59.920 --> 57:04.000
- I think I'll call ...
- No, he could get sick. Take him.

57:05.920 --> 57:07.560
Take him.

57:09.280 --> 57:12.440
You must help me.
He'll be sick.

57:14.320 --> 57:17.960
- Take him.
- Don't worry, okay? Relax.

57:21.680 --> 57:25.080
Take him! Take him to your truck!

57:25.840 --> 57:30.560
I'll put him in the warmth, okay?
And then we go together to the city.

57:31.560 --> 57:34.680
- Yes?
- Yes. Thank you.

57:56.480 --> 57:58.200
Hey! Hey!

58:11.960 --> 58:14.560
Help! Shit!

58:17.120 --> 58:18.800
Shit!

58:37.720 --> 58:40.160
(Cell phone rings)

58:44.440 --> 58:47.160
- Hello!
- Hello?

58:48.160 --> 58:49.160
Who is it?
What did you say?

59:11.440 --> 59:16.000
So I go up to her ... Suddenly
I just stand with that child in my arms.

59:16.160 --> 59:19.560
As soon as I turn around
and looked at her ...

59:19.720 --> 59:23.640
... Over the fence there.
She jumped down there.

59:26.320 --> 59:30.280
She just asked if I
would put the baby into the heat.

59:30.440 --> 59:32.280
(Baby crying)

59:35.720 --> 59:38.160
Fuck, man. She just runs off.

59:57.560 --> 59:59.000
Shh.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.480
Glad you came. He is inside
in the bedroom with the baby.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.920
Try and hear. I am not the one
to say nothing of the situation.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.800
But I'm 
really sorry about Anna.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.960
Mm.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.280
I'm damn sorry, Andreas.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.840
It's as if he knows that something has
happened. His gaze changed.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.800
Simon, you should go now.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.240
Go. Go!

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.760
- Now just go.
- Ok.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.360
Go!

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.040
Either way, you should know
I'm here for you.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.880
(Crying)

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.200
So, dear.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.920
So so.
(Baby crying)

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.680
So so.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.160
And they are...

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.120
Come on in.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:22.040
It makes me feel so bad.
I'm sorry.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.040
- There is also a little milk.
- No thanks.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:46.480
Ingrid and I think that a coffin made out of 
would be really nice.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.160
- You can of course choose it yourself.
- Of course.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.280
There is a little sugar,
if you like.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:03.000
Or white? That might be
more common here in Denmark?

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.560
- You can do both.
- We do as I want to.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.920
With regard to hymns and flowers ...

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.120
We can't remember,
if Anna had a favorite flower.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.040
But Ingrid loves the lilies,
so maybe you could choose that?

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.280
- Should I keep him a little for you?
- No.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.920
He has been great.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.480
We should have come earlier.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.520
Yes.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.880
I think
you should take a few weeks off.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:53.080
There's also an
internship if you need something going on.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:57.560
Simon, you take Thomas along
with you. And then get some rest.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.400
I am ready. It makes sense
to me, if we can find the child.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.640
There is nothing
on the surveillance cameras.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.080
It is only you who have seen
a man take your child.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.800
- A man, you can not describe.
- I described him 20 times.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.960
You've described 20 different guys.
You just need one with a wooden legs.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:30.720
I know nothing! You use your
time on the victim! Fucking find him!

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.280
We're going to find him.
And you know what happens then?

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.320
- So do you time.
- You've decided that it's me.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.920
Shut up, Tristan.
Sanne told everything.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.160
What did she say?

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:51.960
She has not said a damn thing. It is
illegal to lie to the police.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.120
She said, that you found him dead
on the bathroom floor.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.080
She told that you panicked.
And then you took him.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.280
So now we want to know:
Where did you take him?

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.640
She also said that it was you
who killed him.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.520
<I> Where is he? </ I>

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.360
Come on, Tristan.
Come on. No?

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:45.240
Okay, I'll tell everything.
I have tried to protect Sanne.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.600
I come out in the morning,
I have just woken up.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:55.120
And there he is, Sonny, dead in
the bathroom. I swear.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.040
I have done nothing. Nothing.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.360
What did you do?

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:07.320
Sanne must admit it,
I didn't have anything to do with him.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:11.120
I am not going to jail for something
I have not done.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.160
How the hell did you know about
the bathroom floor?

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:18.840
It was just a guess.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.040
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.680
Can I have five minutes alone
with her?

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.720
Are sweet to close the door after you?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.120
How are you?

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:07.760
Tristan has admitted
that Sonny is dead.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.520
It is not him.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.200
You sat with the dead child in your arms for several
hours and said, "What have I done?"

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:21.840
What have you done? What
happened? How did Sonny die?

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.000
It is not him.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:28.880
People look very different
when they are dead.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.800
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Just tell us the truth.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:38.319
I don't know where he is.
Tristan buried him.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:45.520
Did he say where? Where?

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:50.439
Where did he burry him?
Where has he buried him, Sanne?

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:05.760
Did I tell you what they do
in prison to child murderers?

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.880
Several have been poured
boiling water in the crotch.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.120
Look at me.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.600
You don't have to say anything anymore.
You'll go out soon.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.680
So.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.800
Mother? Mother?

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.880
Yes, what is it?

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.440
I need to run for few hours.
It's just some work.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:48.600
Then I'll take him.
NÃ¥rh, it's allright.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.520
Thank you.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.480
(Door buzzer)

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.040
The police. I need to talk to
a patient. Sanne Thomsen.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:08.040
- One moment.
- Thank you.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.440
Andreas Juhl.
I need to talk to Sanne Thomsen.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.960
- Right now?
- Right now.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.280
She is sleeping.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.040
- Yes, just sit there.
- Thank you.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.600
(Women crying)

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.720
(Alarm buzzer)

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.000
I want him back!

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.640
I want him back!

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.960
No! Don't!
He is not dead! Sonny is not dead!

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.080
Don't.
He is not dead!

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.440
- Take it easy, Sanne.
- Here is the syringe.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.920
Why are you doing this to me?

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.200
I want him back!

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.040
Well, Tristan.
How are you?

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.680
You are fucked, huh?

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.040
Tell us now.
What have you done with Alexander's corpse?

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.280
- Who the hell is Alexander?
- Sonny.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.200
If what you and Sanne say
is true, you have been very unlucky.

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:48.080
Death occurs.
It's not your fault.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.720
But if we do not find the body
and get the autopsy -

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.920
- You will be convicted of murder.
You know.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.360
It's your choice.
Think about it Tristan.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:06.120
- I took him out in a forest.
- Where?

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.600
I took him out in a forest.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.920
<I> I took a bicycle and drove out.
I don't know where. </ I>

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:19.000
What did you say? You don't know
where you burried your own son ?!

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.240
I was out.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:26.480
<I> I want to show you how,
if I can figure it out. </ i>

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.840
I would like to be allowed to
to say one thing first.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.840
It is Sanne, who did this.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.040
I think she has strangled him.
She has tried many times.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.920
I really tried
to stop her many times.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.760
She woudn't have killed him directly.
She should never have had him.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.080
That's fucked up that she
takes care of him when she has clients.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.880
She's a whore, okay?

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.520
Now she has
turned my little boy to death.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.560
Andreas!

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.600
Andreas! Stop it!

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:10.200
Andreas!
Stop it!

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.800
(Door opens)

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.520
- Now you go home.
- I'm sorry.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:32.520
You go home now.
Take a sleeping pill and get some sleep.

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.360
As normal people.
And then talk about it with someone.

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.760
Other than your mother!

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:43.000
Go home.
And Simon take over from here.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.800
It will all be understood. And then
are you going to talk to a psychologist.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:01.360
- Tristan Markussens
custody extended by four weeks.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.240
Four weeks for something,
I have not done?

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.960
Tristan, hear what I say.
In addition to the current case -

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.480
- They have seized about
a kilo of hard drugs from your aunt's place.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:17.280
My aunt's place! I have no idea
what Kirsten is doing!

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:21.200
In addition, they seized
a weapon with your fingerprints -

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.000
- <I> From your </ i> residence. The maximum penalty
is up to six years for these conditions.

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.320
Therefore I extend Tristan Markussens
custody by four weeks.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.000
- <I> Fucking cunt!
</ I> - Can we get the prisoner out?

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.680
- I found something!
- Keep an eye on him.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:57.120
Someone dug here recently.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.520
Andrew, this is Simon here.
We have found the body.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:43.120
We'll take it for autopsy. I'll call you
tomorrow when we have an answer.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:48.120
<I> Andrew, are you there? </ I>

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.000
<I> Andreas? - Are you there? </ I>

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.880
<I> Andreas? </ I>

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.120
Good morning.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.280
Hello. Please.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:45.920
- Well, you are early.
- It's just me.

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.520
- Should I come back later?
- No, no.

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:53.600
There are no signs of external damage.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.920
But CT and X-ray
was very revealing.

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.200
Here is the child's head.

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:04.480
The fresh bleeding derived from
a subdural hematoma, which is the most evident here.

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.240
Can you see it?

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.000
What did you say?

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.600
There was a bleeding here
under the hard meninges.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:18.440
There is also a hygrom,
a fluid-filled cavity, -

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:22.200
- Derived from
one or more previous bleedings.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.800
However, the fresh bleeding
has beaten the child to death.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:33.760
Let me show you here ...
I have taken a picture of the torso.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.880
There are some broken ribs,
characteristic of shake violence.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.640
Where the offender sticked his fingers
in the body and shaked the baby.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:49.120
What we are dealing with is
<I> shaken baby syndrome. </ I>

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.840
Now, I am not the police,
but this is a manslaughter.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.680
(Sniffles)

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.440
<I> Andreas? </ I>

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.280
Andreas?

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.800
Andreas?

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:09.920
What the hell are you doing here? Why are
you sitting here for? Have you been there?

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.960
You are bleeding.
What did you do to your fingers?

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.960
(Automobile engine)
Hey, hey. What is happening?

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.080
I know it's hard now.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:29.280
I want to help you.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.760
Andreas, dammit.

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.880
Get out of here!

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.600
- Hello.
- Hello, darling.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.640
Andreas?

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.880
What's happening?

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.000
What are you doing?

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:29.160
- What are you doing? Your hand!
- Mother! Sit down.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.240
Sit down. Stop!

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.320
Andrew, what is happening?
Would you tell ...

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.520
Andreas?

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.320
<I> What have you done
Alexander's body? </ I>

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.800
<I> Who the hell is Alexander? </ I>

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:16.320
<I> It's not him. I 
could tell if he was dead. </ i>

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.640
Hello.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.000
(Babble)

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.440
Yes ...

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.400
What are saying?

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.360
You came again.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.880
You're so fine. You're so fine.

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.600
If you want to get rid of me,
you need to try harder.

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.360
Where is Sonny?

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:55.440
I should have figured it out sooner, 
but the idea was too crazy.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.640
I thought,
it was the right thing to do.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.520
It was the right thing to do.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:14.800
Of course it wasn't
the right thing to do.

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:20.600
I didn't know,
Anna ...

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:27.320
When I woke up in the night,
and he screamed, it was...

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.560
He screamed for help.

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.880
He screamed for help.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.680
They will all understand,
what you have done.

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.960
But he should be back
with his mother.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:46.280
She'll never get out of it.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.680
He'll go to a foster family.
There's nothing you can do about it.

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.280
It's not your business, okay?

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:19.680
You're redundant,
but you probably won't go to prison.

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:24.960
These are extenuating circumstances.
You'll certainly get a suspended sentence.

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:30.280
I'll have to tell her yourself. 
Take me over to her.

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.640
- Here.
- Sonny ...

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.600
Hello.

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:54.000
Hello.

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.720
Sanne...

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.680
Sorry.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.240
Are you lost?

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:16.720
- No.
- My mom forgot screws.

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:21.680
I've got a hammer.

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.840
I just can't get it out.

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:33.760
What's your name?

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.840
Sonny.

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:41.440
Are you sure you're not lost?

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.440
Yes, I work here.
