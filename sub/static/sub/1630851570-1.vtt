WEBVTT

01:42.144 --> 01:43.554
I look good, baby.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.931
Yeah, you do, baby.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.309
Hm.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.858
Baby.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.316
Let's go cause some trouble.

02:09.670 --> 02:12.663
This might go south. We need backup.

02:14.343 --> 02:17.023
What if somebody gets killed
because of the product they're selling?

02:18.722 --> 02:20.258
What if you die?

02:22.643 --> 02:25.806
- It doesn't matter.
- Look.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.137
I've been chasing their boss forever.

02:28.231 --> 02:31.098
Yeah, so maybe it's time to do
something different for once.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.729
- You with me?
- Yeah, I'm with you.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.526
I'm gonna go in after these guys.
I'm not letting these guys go.

02:35.614 --> 02:38.481
- I'm with you! I'm with you.
- All right, let's go! Come on!

02:50.337 --> 02:52.248
Don't make mama bear
get fucking pissed off...

02:52.339 --> 02:55.502
Yeah, this whole deal
is bullshit. Bullshit!

05:45.136 --> 05:48.003
Gotta get out of here!
Let's go! Let's go!

06:15.959 --> 06:18.951
- I'm not leaving you!
- Go!

06:19.045 --> 06:21.377
- They're not gonna get away with this.
- Run!

06:39.274 --> 06:41.310
Goddamn!

06:41.401 --> 06:44.768
A flesh wound's not
supposed to hurt this bad! Is it? Ah!

06:44.863 --> 06:46.524
Hold on, baby!

07:05.926 --> 07:06.926
Motherfucker.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.140
- He's right behind us!
- Shit!

07:37.457 --> 07:39.448
It's you and me against
the world, baby!

08:30.969 --> 08:32.708
Hey, Eric.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.715
If you're listening to this...

08:36.725 --> 08:38.010
Look, man, I...

08:39.102 --> 08:40.763
I know it's a tough time.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.184
With Hannah's funeral over
with, I...

08:47.402 --> 08:49.393
I'm gonna come up later to talk.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.275
Make sure you're doing okay.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.028
All right. I'll see you then.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.366
You can't drop me! I'm a bunny!

09:46.461 --> 09:48.747
I'm a good bunny too!

09:55.887 --> 09:58.503
You just dropped me on the ground!

09:58.598 --> 10:01.260
- Eric, be careful.
- Hold up!

10:01.351 --> 10:03.842
I got this, I got it, I got it.
Oh, there we go now.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.622
- I love you.
- I love you.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.865
Eric, look out!

11:37.322 --> 11:39.904
All right, go! Go, go, go!

11:39.991 --> 11:41.322
I can't get the call through!

11:41.409 --> 11:44.025
Damn it!

11:45.788 --> 11:48.621
Hello? Is anybody in there?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.323
Help! Hello!

11:58.009 --> 11:59.545
- He's coming.
- Fuck!

12:02.138 --> 12:03.753
Ah! Goddamn it!

12:06.226 --> 12:07.432
Get the door!

12:12.982 --> 12:14.688
Oh, shit!

12:20.198 --> 12:21.278
Oh!

12:39.425 --> 12:41.040
I'll kill you!

12:42.887 --> 12:44.878
Jj

13:26.306 --> 13:27.386
Ah!

13:44.782 --> 13:46.773
Jj

13:50.621 --> 13:53.328
Come on, big boy! Come on, big boy!

13:57.837 --> 13:59.452
Come on, you wanna fucking dance? Huh?

14:03.718 --> 14:05.254
No! No, no, no!

14:05.345 --> 14:07.802
No! You let her go!

14:07.889 --> 14:10.926
No, you let her go! You let her go, pig!

14:11.017 --> 14:12.257
Don't you touch my baby.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.851
Get down here, Mickey, it's over!

14:17.273 --> 14:18.729
You all need to leave.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.432
Please, mister, he got a knife.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.984
He's got my girl. He got me in the arm...

14:25.365 --> 14:28.607
Stupid ass.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.737
That was nice.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.364
You'd be doing me a favor.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.117
Seriously?

14:39.629 --> 14:41.415
You're an interesting fella.

14:41.506 --> 14:44.623
We got ourselves an odd duck
in our pond, baby girl!

14:44.717 --> 14:47.629
- Let him go!
- You move, big boy,

14:47.720 --> 14:51.804
and he dies all over you.
Wet and red!

14:52.809 --> 14:54.299
What are you people doing here?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.350
Oh. Me and Violet,

14:56.437 --> 15:00.100
we just a couple of lovebirds
looking for a nest.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.853
Location, location, location.

15:05.780 --> 15:08.647
Now, I'm gonna need you
to do me a straight solid.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.606
Reach into my pocket, get the cell phone.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.111
You watch that trigger, Mickey!

15:12.203 --> 15:13.363
Shut up!

15:14.747 --> 15:17.864
Come on, Mr. quackers.
Get my cell phone.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.450
- I told you, let him go!
- Who are you?

15:20.545 --> 15:23.582
- I'm a cop. It's fine.
- Get my goddamn cell phone!

15:23.673 --> 15:26.540
- Where is it?
- Front left pocket.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.750
There you go. Oh! There you go.

15:28.845 --> 15:32.463
Easy, boy.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.720
Don't get any ideas. He's not your type.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.664
You and me against the world, baby.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.680
You and me against the world, baby!

15:41.774 --> 15:44.106
- I love you.
- Just do it.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.435
All right now.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.566
Just push... push my last text.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.898
Yeah. There you go.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.075
Now, uh, send the location.

15:55.538 --> 15:58.218
I use a home phone. I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.958
The thing that looks like a paperclip!

16:03.045 --> 16:05.752
A little round fucking paperclip.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.080
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.961
The second you pull that trigger,

16:09.051 --> 16:11.508
I'm putting this knife right
into your girlfriend's throat.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.929
Okay.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.553
Pass it back, Mr. quackers.
Come on. Pass it back.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.053
Pass it back!

16:21.314 --> 16:24.272
Yeah, no, no. We don't want anybody to see
what we're gonna do to him.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.378
It's nothing compared
to what we did to your partner.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.688
- Mm!
- Fuck you!

16:28.779 --> 16:30.315
Yeah.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.441
Stop!

16:32.450 --> 16:34.736
You let him walk down those stairs
and out the front door,

16:34.827 --> 16:37.409
- and [I'll follow with Violet.
- Don't listen to him!

16:37.497 --> 16:39.829
Don't make me fucking hurt you!
All right?

16:39.916 --> 16:43.158
Let him walk down the stairs, and when we
get to the door, we all release.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.288
Why would I do that, big boy,

16:45.379 --> 16:48.587
when we can just sit back
and chillax, huh?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.234
You think they'll be here quick enough?

16:51.052 --> 16:52.883
Quick enough? No.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.428
They've been tracking us since we...
Since we split the warehouse.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.225
Friends and family plan, son.
Ooh, it's good for the kids.

17:00.311 --> 17:03.303
Gave them the final destination.
It's gonna be a hell of a reunion.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.685
Let him walk down the stairs,
and we'll finish this later.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.727
Come on.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.435
Just shoot him!

17:14.032 --> 17:16.444
I'm not gonna let him hurt you, baby.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.527
Walk down the stairs.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.323
Jj

17:33.344 --> 17:34.584
Yeah!

17:36.597 --> 17:38.337
Move, ducky!

17:45.231 --> 17:46.562
See you soon.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.442
You okay?

18:05.668 --> 18:06.783
- You get him?
- Not enough!

18:06.877 --> 18:08.083
Oh, my god!

18:14.218 --> 18:16.334
Find him! Where is he?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.169
Come on, big boy!

18:20.725 --> 18:22.135
Goddamn it!

18:23.227 --> 18:25.889
Check his house for ammo.
I'm gonna check his car.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.775
- What the fuck?
- Dude! Shut up!

18:32.862 --> 18:35.103
They're gonna hear you, all right?

18:35.197 --> 18:37.438
I need you to get to safety. Now.

18:38.659 --> 18:42.197
Look, this is my farm.
They don't belong here.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.495
Shit, you don't belong here.
Why would I be the one...

18:44.582 --> 18:46.118
You need to get the hell out of here.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.538
These people will kill you.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.998
I think I did a pretty good job
taking care of myself back there.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.128
Almost got us both killed.

19:01.682 --> 19:02.762
Is there anybody else here?

19:03.768 --> 19:06.134
Anybody else that might come here?
A wife, maybe kids?

19:09.148 --> 19:10.433
Just me.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.156
You really don't have a cell?

19:22.328 --> 19:25.035
No need.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.703
No one to call.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.871
Who needs to be quiet now?

19:35.091 --> 19:37.002
Comes in handy, don't it?

19:39.595 --> 19:41.802
Listen.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.513
Is there only one road on the farm?

19:44.600 --> 19:47.387
No, I got a back road
down there through the brush.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.014
Takes you to the main drag.

19:49.105 --> 19:53.439
Good. I need you
to head through the brush,

19:53.526 --> 19:55.232
and back to town.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.934
Understand?

19:57.029 --> 19:59.486
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I don't have time for this.

19:59.573 --> 20:03.316
It seems to me
you might be able to use a little backup

20:03.411 --> 20:05.322
until your police friends get here.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.621
No one else is coming.
Not to help, at least.

20:08.708 --> 20:13.202
You need to run.
This is my fight, not yours.

20:15.297 --> 20:19.040
Run? This is my farm. Not yours.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.589
You heard them mention my partner?

20:23.889 --> 20:25.629
He was a cop for 30 years.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.316
He knew what he was doing
when they killed him.

20:30.855 --> 20:34.222
I'm sorry. I may not get
another chance like this.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.978
Go to the road, and head to town. Now!

20:47.288 --> 20:49.074
Sounds about right.

21:01.761 --> 21:05.219
Yeah, he ain't
calling the cavalry anytime soon.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.763
- Angel!
- Yeah?

21:07.850 --> 21:11.183
- How do you load one of these things?
- I'll show you, sugar plum.

21:11.270 --> 21:15.354
You... you just...
You get it on her back.

21:15.441 --> 21:19.855
And then you just put it in.
Nice and easy.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.108
Hold that. Ow!

21:24.825 --> 21:26.611
Man, I...

21:26.702 --> 21:28.738
Frank.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.741
- Yeah, frank?
- Three minutes.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.288
Get ready.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.622
You telling me what to do?

21:40.299 --> 21:42.631
Uh, "yeah, get ready."

21:44.178 --> 21:46.669
Well, if he thinks that he's gonna be
using this...

21:46.764 --> 21:48.470
He better think again.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.299
- Pew! Ha!
- Looks good on you.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.472
Get some practice shots!

21:55.606 --> 21:57.346
Make them count, baby girl.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.188
Bang!

22:02.279 --> 22:03.359
Jj

22:03.447 --> 22:06.814
Bang. Mickey, I think
I'm getting the hang of this thing!

22:08.828 --> 22:12.446
Come on. Move!

22:12.540 --> 22:13.700
Shit!

22:29.557 --> 22:31.263
Leave my farm.

23:02.631 --> 23:03.711
All right.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.664
Jj

23:48.844 --> 23:51.335
- Yo, boss, do you see that?
- Park here.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.054
Jj

24:14.787 --> 24:16.197
This is my farm.

24:38.143 --> 24:41.135
Jj

25:29.445 --> 25:30.935
Do you see something, sir?

25:33.991 --> 25:36.607
Do you need me to flush out the area?
Because I...

25:45.711 --> 25:49.203
Bang! Bang!

25:51.717 --> 25:52.717
Bang!

25:56.555 --> 25:58.675
Look, all's I'm saying is this.
It's the 21st century,

25:58.766 --> 26:01.257
and y'all living under a monarchy
like it's the middle ages.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.391
Excuse me, mate, we're very lucky
to have a monarch.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.331
Closest you guys ever came
to a monarch is Elvis,

26:05.355 --> 26:06.916
and you know what they said
about Elvis, right?

26:06.940 --> 26:08.835
Okay, fish sticks, you hold
your horses right there.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.211
Don't you blaspheme about the king.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.235
Well, maybe you don't say
anything about the queen.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.069
- Fine. Deal.
- Deal?

26:15.157 --> 26:18.775
Now, we're all gonna shut the fuck up.

26:18.869 --> 26:21.076
You do realize that we have the guns?

26:21.163 --> 26:22.448
- Yes.
- Okay.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.916
Sir, we're wasting time.
It was probably a bird.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.882
What? Oh, shit!

26:41.141 --> 26:43.348
Goddamn, woman!

26:43.435 --> 26:46.142
You make me hard with a gun
in your hand, girl.

26:46.230 --> 26:49.893
He's down there, baby.
We're gonna get him!

26:49.983 --> 26:52.144
Let's go get the bad man.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.447
Cal, run!

27:07.501 --> 27:09.366
It's no bird.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.962
(Get in there.

27:16.051 --> 27:19.043
Jj

27:23.559 --> 27:25.245
I don't mean to be a burr
under your saddle, boss,

27:25.269 --> 27:27.122
but are we fixing to get out of here
any time soon...?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.261
All of you.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.765
(Get in there.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.058
Fuck, it's hot.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.075
You good?

27:52.171 --> 27:53.957
- You got this, baby.
- I got this.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.787
What the fuck? Pussy. Come on, let's go.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.339
Guns up, guys, come on!

28:11.940 --> 28:13.931
Jj

28:23.243 --> 28:26.326
- Where the hell is he?
- Oh, he's close.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.536
- Frank.
- Frank.

28:36.632 --> 28:37.792
Goddamn it.

29:04.117 --> 29:07.735
All right. All right.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.286
David?

29:13.835 --> 29:15.371
Get the fuck off me!

29:17.339 --> 29:19.330
You think I'm gonna run?

29:19.424 --> 29:21.039
Put that fucking gun down!

29:23.011 --> 29:25.377
Why are you wasting my time?

29:25.472 --> 29:27.713
Just kill me.

29:27.808 --> 29:30.720
I'm not gonna devolve myself
to such behavior.

29:30.811 --> 29:33.518
You're my prisoner till my boss gets here.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.391
Perhaps he will allow you the luxury.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.686
I hear you two have quite a history.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.892
Yes.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.688
Take him in there. See to his wound.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.489
We may need him ready
to move at any point.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.282
Yes, sir. All right.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.822
Tyson, Lisa.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.476
Move these cars
and hide them somewhere.

29:54.543 --> 29:55.623
We don't wanna show anybody

29:55.711 --> 29:58.202
who might happen to stumble
upon this shithole that we're here.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.912
- Would we?
- Got you, boss.

30:00.007 --> 30:01.007
Copy.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.553
How the fuck are we supposed
to see to his wound?

30:12.644 --> 30:15.727
I'm not a doctor, ed. I'm not a nurse.
I haven't got medical training, have 1?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.679
You remind me more of a candy striper.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.264
What the fuck's that mean?

30:19.359 --> 30:21.520
Well, it's like a nurse
without medical training.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.567
Why are you being such a hillbilly today?

30:23.655 --> 30:25.862
I'm not a hillbilly. I'm a redneck.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.280
What's the difference?

30:27.367 --> 30:29.345
Generally speaking,
we don't sleep with our sisters.

30:29.369 --> 30:32.953
- Busy searching the area, I see.
- Been there, done that.

30:33.040 --> 30:36.123
Got the bloody t-shirt for it. I'm good.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.370
- Mickey?
- Hm?

30:38.462 --> 30:40.748
Tell me, where's the other cop?

30:40.839 --> 30:43.421
- Oh, he's close. Mm-hmm.
- Close. With the farmer.

30:43.508 --> 30:44.668
- Mm, maybe.
- Maybe.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.760
Shut up.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.302
- He might be with a farmer?
- Mm.

30:49.389 --> 30:53.177
So what you're saying is
that a man is running around,

30:53.268 --> 30:56.010
someone who might be with a cop,

30:56.104 --> 30:58.140
but you have no idea. Either of you.

31:01.109 --> 31:02.224
- Are they injured?
- Yeah.

31:02.319 --> 31:05.186
No. They're not seriously injured.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.647
- Are they armed?
- No. They're not armed.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.448
- Mm-mm.
- Spoke to your brother, Mickey.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.618
- He's on his way.
- Step-brother.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.162
Step-brother.
Why is he on his way here?

31:17.584 --> 31:20.121
He's curious as to how
this happened, as am I.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.753
See? But you were there, Francis.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.421
You saw the whole thing go down.

31:25.509 --> 31:27.420
Remember? Boom boom? Bang bang?

31:27.511 --> 31:29.126
You were shooting at the guy.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.547
That was you! It was him!

31:33.642 --> 31:35.553
It... it was me.

31:35.644 --> 31:38.681
And I know I wasn't followed
to the warehouse.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.933
I know I wasn't followed here.

31:41.024 --> 31:45.017
And I know I have the cop I was left with
under control.

31:46.780 --> 31:50.614
- Hmm.
- So I'm gonna wait for an answer.

31:50.700 --> 31:54.363
You both can tell me. Where's yours?

31:54.454 --> 31:57.696
- We'll handle it.
- He's around here somewhere.

31:57.791 --> 32:01.204
- Sneaky. Sneaky.
- Sneaky.

32:01.294 --> 32:04.161
- You should get on it, then.
- I'll get on that.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.337
Do you think he wears lifts?

32:10.887 --> 32:12.468
He looks like he wears lifts.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.130
Bye, buddy.

32:15.225 --> 32:18.217
Jj

32:25.110 --> 32:26.691
In there!

32:32.033 --> 32:36.652
Pretty sure
they're gonna come in here.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.532
Yeah, they will.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.376
Please tell me you have more guns?

32:45.464 --> 32:48.171
Uh, my wife isn't, uh...

32:48.258 --> 32:50.123
Wasn't a fan.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.087
I'm sure we can make something work.

32:55.182 --> 32:57.639
Go hide in the corner,
I'll take care of them if they come in.

32:57.726 --> 33:00.342
- Go.
- Fuck that.

33:00.437 --> 33:01.927
You go hide in the corner.

33:03.023 --> 33:05.765
- What?
- You wanna die?

33:08.737 --> 33:12.104
I've looked death in the face
more times than I can count.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.531
At this point, we're old friends.

33:14.618 --> 33:17.325
Never need an excuse
to see an old friend, now do I?

33:26.004 --> 33:28.416
- Where's your gun?
- I didn't bring one.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.293
Oh, my god.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.123
What the fuck were you thinking?

33:34.679 --> 33:36.590
Can one of you guys
loan him one of your guns?

33:36.681 --> 33:39.548
Fuck that, this is mine.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.305
Okay, check the area
and make sure he didn't get away. Fuck.

33:42.395 --> 33:45.057
- I'm fine.
- Just stay behind me.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.934
Jj

35:27.584 --> 35:29.165
Fuck! Come on!

35:50.732 --> 35:52.268
Jesus!

35:55.403 --> 35:57.064
Fuck!

36:01.201 --> 36:02.481
Who the fuck was that other guy?

36:03.453 --> 36:04.453
They killed Rob!

36:08.708 --> 36:11.700
Jj

36:18.009 --> 36:20.716
- Frank.
- What?

36:20.804 --> 36:23.386
What are you doing?
Having a senior moment?

36:23.473 --> 36:26.806
I have to know this place
because you can bet your ass he does.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.426
Who?

36:31.064 --> 36:33.100
The farmer, you morons.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.983
You know, frank,
I know you think you're in charge,

36:37.070 --> 36:40.528
- but we're just as important.
- As what?

36:40.615 --> 36:42.947
Do you both think
you're as integral as me?

36:43.034 --> 36:45.320
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

36:45.412 --> 36:47.653
We're gonna get one thing straight.

36:47.747 --> 36:50.284
We are colleagues, not friends.

36:50.375 --> 36:55.290
Coming here to help your sorry asses
was nothing more than a business decision.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.086
And like you said...

36:58.216 --> 37:00.081
The boss is only your stepbrother.

37:01.219 --> 37:05.633
And don't you think for one second
that I am not fully aware

37:05.724 --> 37:11.094
of just how frayed and fragile
that relationship truly is.

37:12.689 --> 37:15.055
Rethink your importance, my friend.

37:16.192 --> 37:17.728
Or I sure as well will.

37:19.738 --> 37:20.738
Frank!

37:22.198 --> 37:24.405
- Yes?
- It's Rob.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.198
What about Rob?

37:27.579 --> 37:28.785
He's dead.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.541
He's a dick.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.962
I'm gonna kill every one of those fuckers.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.839
- Listen...
- No, you listen to me, all right?

37:45.930 --> 37:46.930
They have my partner.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.006
Who the fuck are these guys?

37:50.310 --> 37:52.392
They're drug dealers. Scumbags.

37:54.063 --> 37:56.600
My partner and I have been
chasing them for years.

37:56.691 --> 37:59.182
Finally got close enough this morning.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.108
I know what they're capable of.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.812
I know what their product
does to normal people.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.405
Went into that warehouse,
and, well, shit hit the fan.

38:09.496 --> 38:11.361
Here we are.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.457
Is there really nobody else here?

38:16.544 --> 38:18.159
No, it's, uh...

38:20.048 --> 38:23.131
Hannah... my wife.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.509
She and I used to run
the place together, and, uh...

38:26.554 --> 38:29.341
I did a tour in Iraq.

38:29.432 --> 38:34.301
Grenade went off next to me,
and put me in a body cast for a year.

38:34.395 --> 38:38.138
And, uh, I had a nurse.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.440
She brought me back, you know.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.439
She nursed me back to health,
took care of me.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.905
She was my angel.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.277
That was Hannah.

38:52.914 --> 38:55.576
I remember, uh, I was laying in that bed

38:55.667 --> 38:58.875
and, uh, I made a promise to god.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.795
I said, uh,

39:02.882 --> 39:06.249
"man, if I ever get out of this cast,

39:06.344 --> 39:08.335
I'm gonna marry that woman.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.804
I'm never gonna kill again."

39:14.018 --> 39:16.805
I mean, before that,
I was a shell of the man I used to be.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.182
I was a fucking disaster,

39:19.274 --> 39:20.274
and, uh...

39:23.862 --> 39:25.227
And then she came into my life.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.779
She filled me up.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.911
She made me feel alive.

39:36.666 --> 39:37.826
Gave me a daughter.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.796
She died two weeks ago.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.166
Eric, look out!

39:56.102 --> 39:57.433
My daughter too.

40:02.275 --> 40:03.981
And I just quit, you know.

40:06.237 --> 40:10.822
On life, on, uh... on everything.

40:10.909 --> 40:14.242
I mean, what's the fucking point, right?

40:16.039 --> 40:17.039
Hence, the, uh...

40:19.959 --> 40:21.290
I'm sorry, man.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.377
I really am.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.125
I gotta finish this.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.095
You have a house phone?

40:39.103 --> 40:40.218
In the kitchen.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.224
Good.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.773
I'm gonna go to the house,

40:45.860 --> 40:48.226
get to the phone and get David, all right?

40:48.321 --> 40:49.606
I'm going with you.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.235
I'm finishing this alone.

40:53.326 --> 40:59.037
I've been in this situation enough times
to know that you need my help.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.665
Even if you're too damn
stubborn to know it.

41:06.881 --> 41:09.293
And that's the house
that I shared with my wife.

41:11.844 --> 41:14.381
It's my house.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.928
And it's all I've got left.

41:18.851 --> 41:21.342
And fuck, I ain't got
nothing to live for anyway.

41:26.234 --> 41:27.440
All right.

41:29.779 --> 41:32.771
Jj

41:48.798 --> 41:52.507
Well, this is certainly a development.

41:52.593 --> 41:55.801
A development? That's Rob.

41:55.888 --> 41:58.174
No, it was Rob.

41:58.266 --> 41:59.847
It would still be if any of you knew

41:59.934 --> 42:02.641
how to handle your jobs
for a good goddamn minute.

42:04.230 --> 42:07.722
Frank, we didn't know we'd die doing this.

42:07.817 --> 42:09.353
We came here to kill.

42:10.778 --> 42:13.064
Or did any of you not
get the memo on that?

42:13.156 --> 42:15.238
Because evidently, this cop did.

42:15.324 --> 42:17.940
We're wasting fucking time, man.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.072
No, we're wasting fucking friends, Mickey.

42:20.163 --> 42:22.324
Oh, you're killing me, smalls.

42:22.415 --> 42:24.781
- Mickey.
- Yeah?

42:24.876 --> 42:27.208
For once, I agree.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.089
Lisa...

42:34.719 --> 42:36.334
Come here.

42:36.429 --> 42:38.090
I can't, frank.

42:39.223 --> 42:42.135
Lisa, if you would...

42:51.903 --> 42:53.018
Now.

42:55.031 --> 42:57.022
Jj

42:59.827 --> 43:01.283
Sorry for the mess.

43:04.123 --> 43:07.035
Do you fancy leaving here
with Liam and the gang, Lisa?

43:08.628 --> 43:11.711
No. I want him dead.

43:11.798 --> 43:13.914
You want him dead.

43:15.009 --> 43:16.499
Yes.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.505
Of course you do.

43:19.514 --> 43:22.005
Well, then it's settled.

43:22.100 --> 43:25.012
We kill or be killed. Is that clear?

43:25.103 --> 43:26.468
Boo-yah!

43:27.980 --> 43:29.641
Get your asses out of here.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.613
I et's move.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.156
On your six.

43:41.244 --> 43:43.405
I want nobody
going off on their own.

43:43.496 --> 43:45.862
We'll stay together
with somebody at all times.

43:45.957 --> 43:48.289
Liam, that's you and me...

43:48.376 --> 43:50.708
Go to the phone, call for backup. Go.

43:50.795 --> 43:53.286
That way. He's up there! Get him!

43:53.381 --> 43:54.962
Fuck, get him!

43:57.385 --> 43:58.841
Shouldn't we be going after him?

43:58.928 --> 44:01.089
Listen to me. Get him back.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.991
I don't give a shit what you
have to do with the farmer.

44:03.015 --> 44:05.202
Both of those cops need to be
in that house when Michael arrives.

44:05.226 --> 44:07.842
- You mean the cop you shot.
- Yes.

44:07.937 --> 44:09.518
The one we now have in custody.

44:09.605 --> 44:13.314
The one that you went after is now giving
us chase around the fucking farm.

44:13.401 --> 44:16.143
They followed you here, Mickey.
Don't you ever forget that.

44:16.237 --> 44:17.977
So what are you gonna be doing?

44:18.072 --> 44:19.466
Finding out what the other one knows.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.323
The more people get killed,
the more all of us look bad.

44:23.327 --> 44:24.988
Oh, one more thing, Mickey.

44:26.289 --> 44:29.031
Your stepbrother is not someone
any of us wanna look bad to.

44:29.125 --> 44:30.365
Got it?

44:38.676 --> 44:41.668
Jj

45:15.588 --> 45:17.795
Are you sure you tied him up good?

45:17.882 --> 45:20.464
- Yes, ed, I'm sure.
- I'm sorry.

45:20.551 --> 45:22.029
You don't remember that jockey in Fresno

45:22.053 --> 45:24.364
that weaseled out of them ropes you tied,
goes running down the street?

45:24.388 --> 45:27.551
That was partially my fault.
That was partially your fault.

45:27.642 --> 45:30.475
- All right, fair.
- You two suck.

45:33.564 --> 45:36.647
- Officer.
- It's detective.

45:39.278 --> 45:41.485
You two don't seem
to be having much fun here.

45:41.572 --> 45:43.779
They suck.

45:47.453 --> 45:48.488
Thank you.

45:50.248 --> 45:52.034
Ah, yes, of course.

45:52.124 --> 45:54.035
Detective Watson.

45:54.126 --> 45:56.868
So nice to finally make
your acquaintance, indeed.

45:56.963 --> 45:59.295
I've been told a lot about you before.

46:00.758 --> 46:01.758
Ed...

46:04.220 --> 46:06.836
Move the cop's and Violet's cars.

46:06.931 --> 46:08.700
We don't want anything
looking out of place, do we?

46:08.724 --> 46:10.305
Yes, sir.

46:11.560 --> 46:13.016
And do it quietly, ed.

46:13.104 --> 46:15.595
They'll hear the gunshots.

46:15.690 --> 46:18.807
You mean the gunshots on a private farm
in the middle of nowhere?

46:20.736 --> 46:22.943
I think there is a certain word for that.

46:23.030 --> 46:24.361
Right, detective?

46:26.867 --> 46:28.073
"Legal."

46:31.247 --> 46:32.828
Now, my boss is on his way.

46:32.915 --> 46:36.749
So rather than all this bullshit,
let's see what he has to say. Shall we?

46:44.302 --> 46:47.135
- Michael, hello.
- What's going on?

46:47.221 --> 46:50.429
I'm sitting here with our good friend,
David Watson.

46:50.516 --> 46:54.134
Watson. Put me on loudspeaker.

46:55.146 --> 46:58.229
Well, hello. Is that you, detective?

46:58.316 --> 47:00.227
It's been a while.

47:00.318 --> 47:03.060
I see you've taken over for daddy.

47:03.154 --> 47:06.692
Oh, yeah, and what
a glorious day to do it.

47:06.782 --> 47:10.695
Oh, my god! I missed you, buddy.

47:10.786 --> 47:15.280
I can't wait to see your face
in this helpless position.

47:15.374 --> 47:19.458
After all these years
terrorizing my family,

47:19.545 --> 47:21.831
chasing us and chasing us.

47:21.922 --> 47:25.335
And here you are. Oops!

47:25.426 --> 47:28.008
You belong to me now, cupcake.

47:29.430 --> 47:32.593
- Crazy old world.
- Indeed.

47:32.683 --> 47:36.096
Hey, I'll make sure frank
takes good care of you until I arrive.

47:36.187 --> 47:37.893
We'll hang out, we'll chitchat.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.265
Prepare yourselr,

47:39.357 --> 47:43.350
because I'm gonna pick your brain.

47:56.123 --> 47:59.115
Jj

48:12.681 --> 48:13.887
Bite me!

48:17.061 --> 48:19.581
Well, this sure as shit isn't
how I figured life would work out.

48:20.523 --> 48:22.125
Damn it, I gotta be dumber
than a bag of hammers.

48:22.149 --> 48:25.562
Mama wanted me to go to law school,
but no, I just had to do this, didn't I?

48:25.653 --> 48:28.690
I don't know what the hell this is.
Here I am, moving cars.

48:28.781 --> 48:32.194
Obviously, I'm a valet.
I'll give myself some tips.

48:32.284 --> 48:34.240
Talking to myself...

48:34.328 --> 48:35.722
Get myself some therapy while I'm at.

48:35.746 --> 48:37.953
Come on now, ed,
get your head in the game, boy.

48:38.040 --> 48:41.532
What a fucking idiot.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.163
Shit.

48:43.254 --> 48:44.460
Fuck!

48:44.547 --> 48:48.085
"Ed, go shoot this guy!
Then go bury his body."

48:52.638 --> 48:54.128
Hold on, Michael.

49:01.188 --> 49:04.055
Damn it. God!

49:04.150 --> 49:05.981
Stupid car.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.106
What the hell are you doing?

49:10.197 --> 49:11.197
Oh, hey, frank.

49:11.282 --> 49:12.818
Uh, well, let's see.

49:12.908 --> 49:14.990
First, the car is a piece of shit.

49:15.077 --> 49:16.613
And second, thank you.

49:16.704 --> 49:18.695
I'm fine. Don't worry about me, I'm good.

49:19.707 --> 49:20.707
Just shut up, ed!

49:24.545 --> 49:28.959
- Only the best for your team.
- Michael. What was that?

49:29.049 --> 49:32.382
I don't care how much
you have to hurt the asshole.

49:32.470 --> 49:35.803
Just make him talk.

49:35.890 --> 49:38.051
All right. Copy.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.596
English, hurt him...

49:42.605 --> 49:44.436
While I get my tools, please?

49:50.196 --> 49:52.312
Well...

49:52.406 --> 49:55.443
Now, let's try this again, shall we?

49:55.534 --> 49:59.618
Shit! Ow! Damn it.

49:59.705 --> 50:02.492
You know, I'm done!
I'm done with this bullshit!

50:02.583 --> 50:04.289
This is ridiculous!

50:04.376 --> 50:07.539
I'm a grown-ass man
crawling over damn cars.

50:07.630 --> 50:09.245
Shit! I could've been a lawyer.

50:16.555 --> 50:18.420
- Mickey.
- Violet?

50:19.934 --> 50:21.799
That law dog.

50:21.894 --> 50:25.307
He ain't gunning for justice.
He's gunning for blood.

50:25.397 --> 50:28.639
It ain't our first rodeo, baby.

50:28.734 --> 50:30.599
Yeah.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.559
Tell that to your bullet holes.

50:32.655 --> 50:34.816
Yeah, he took his pound of flesh.

50:34.907 --> 50:36.818
I'm still raring to cha-cha.

50:36.909 --> 50:40.618
Come on, let's go put some silver
on his eyes and send him downriver.

50:42.206 --> 50:45.073
You and me forever, baby.
Against the world.

50:45.167 --> 50:47.158
You and me against the world.

50:47.253 --> 50:48.663
Hey, hey.

50:54.843 --> 50:56.834
Jj

53:35.504 --> 53:36.744
Where's Tyson?

53:38.048 --> 53:40.004
Tyson, where you at, man?

53:40.092 --> 53:41.923
Get up here, all of you.

53:42.010 --> 53:43.875
Wait, there's something over there.

53:46.181 --> 53:48.046
Everyone stop. Stop.

53:49.101 --> 53:50.511
Paul, Lisa, get up here.

53:53.647 --> 53:56.263
I want you two to look up there.

53:56.358 --> 53:59.020
Split up. You go left, Lisa. You go right.

53:59.111 --> 53:59.941
Copy.

54:00.028 --> 54:02.019
Don't waste time. Get up there. Now.

54:03.949 --> 54:05.234
- Liam.
- Yeah?

54:05.325 --> 54:07.565
You remember that turn back there
that goes to the right?

54:07.619 --> 54:09.155
- Yes.
- We're gonna double back,

54:09.246 --> 54:11.057
you're gonna go to the left,
I'm gonna go to the right.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.571
- You ready? Now.
- Copy that.

54:12.666 --> 54:13.826
Now. Go.

54:18.505 --> 54:21.497
Jj

54:30.142 --> 54:33.134
Ed, english.
Hit him in the stomach.

54:33.228 --> 54:34.434
His face is mine.

54:50.162 --> 54:52.323
I really have to hand it to you,
detective.

54:52.414 --> 54:55.906
You are one tough son of a bitch,
I must say.

54:56.001 --> 54:58.333
Mind that. Mind the wrinkles, please.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.751
- Couch.
- Sure.

54:59.838 --> 55:02.750
And pushing retirement, I imagine.

55:02.841 --> 55:06.584
What the hell are you doing, getting
yourself into situations like that?

55:08.138 --> 55:11.005
I'm not old. But my partner
is a little young.

55:11.099 --> 55:14.091
Ah. Where fools rush in.

55:15.395 --> 55:18.307
I certainly know a few people
like that myself.

55:19.441 --> 55:22.228
I'm more of the, um...

55:22.319 --> 55:24.025
How would you call it?

55:24.112 --> 55:25.977
The calculating one.

55:27.407 --> 55:29.819
What about Violet and Mickey?

55:32.913 --> 55:34.824
Don't worry about that, detective.

55:34.915 --> 55:38.328
Yes, those two imbeciles
are quite foolish.

55:39.586 --> 55:42.623
I expect you and I
aren't so different, however.

55:42.714 --> 55:46.502
Similar levels
and not so dissimilar organizations.

55:46.593 --> 55:49.084
I'm nothing like you. Nothing!

55:50.180 --> 55:52.842
I'm just doing my job, detective.

55:52.933 --> 55:57.302
The passionate ones are out there,
running around, waving guns at each other.

55:57.396 --> 55:59.808
It's... unbecoming.

56:16.456 --> 56:18.071
You think you're like me?

56:20.878 --> 56:22.414
You think you're better than me?

56:23.422 --> 56:25.037
You need guys like me.

56:26.174 --> 56:28.756
And I suppose...

56:28.844 --> 56:30.334
In some ways...

56:32.681 --> 56:34.296
I need guys like you.

56:46.445 --> 56:48.686
Crime pays for us both, detective.

56:49.823 --> 56:51.029
You see,

56:52.034 --> 56:56.118
we are a dying breed.

56:56.204 --> 56:58.411
Unfortunately for you...

56:59.416 --> 57:00.416
Ah...

57:03.211 --> 57:05.748
Sooner rather than later, I'm afraid.

57:05.839 --> 57:08.831
Jj

57:18.143 --> 57:19.178
Hey, asshole.

57:20.604 --> 57:21.935
Who are these two idiots?

57:24.650 --> 57:26.515
I got shot today.

57:29.446 --> 57:30.606
And I'm tied up.

57:31.949 --> 57:33.985
And you still hit like a bitch.

57:41.959 --> 57:45.622
Do you think that I'm that stupid
to sit here with you alone?

57:45.712 --> 57:48.078
I just think you're a coward.

57:49.341 --> 57:51.127
You know, not many know this.

57:52.886 --> 57:54.467
But I am an artist.

57:56.598 --> 58:00.216
And I'm going to make you
my finest work.

58:00.310 --> 58:02.016
Yeah.

58:02.104 --> 58:05.267
The screams alone
will bring your partner to me.

58:05.357 --> 58:08.440
- You think he's that stupid?
- Shall we begin?

58:15.075 --> 58:17.282
Shit.

58:17.369 --> 58:19.485
Hey, jackass.

58:19.579 --> 58:21.661
Don't walk away from me.

58:21.748 --> 58:22.783
Watch him.

58:24.501 --> 58:26.662
Does this mean we're not
fucking up his face?

58:29.339 --> 58:32.581
Put the phone down.

58:32.676 --> 58:35.668
You're in my house.

58:35.762 --> 58:38.344
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Ed?

58:39.558 --> 58:41.014
Hello? Are you there?

58:41.101 --> 58:44.719
Put your hands up, boss,
real slow. Come on, now.

58:54.906 --> 58:56.521
Andrew.

59:01.163 --> 59:02.278
Get rid of him.

59:15.135 --> 59:16.671
Goddamn it.

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:05.549
Jj

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:48.037
You got company?

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:53.873
Get rid of him.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:02.504
Uh... neighbor's car.

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:05.461
Letting him park here overnight.

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:06.840
How you been?

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:09.722
I'm busy.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:10.809
Right.

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:16.308
Uh... you know, Andrew, it's, uh...

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:21.731
It's really not a good time right now.

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:24.813
Yeah, lately it never is.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.490
You get my message?

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:34.577
What do you say I, uh, come up here
for a little while,

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:36.875
help you finish fixing the place up?

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:38.668
Might do you some good.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:41.246
I won't even charge you.

01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.001
Hey, hey, hey!

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:48.298
Knock it off.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:51.382
Andrew, I can't have this today.

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:54.559
Okay? It's not the time.
I need you to leave.

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:59.723
Jj

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:11.110
Look, I know how you feel.

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:12.740
Really, I do.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:15.072
You have no idea how I feel.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:20.627
I'm just saying that being here alone
all the time ain't good for you.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.540
You still got friends who care about you.

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:39.434
I'm gonna be the guy
that's gonna kill you.

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:47.108
Yeah, I wanna be
that guy right now, Andrew.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:52.784
But I need you to get
the fuck off my land.

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.202
You hear me?

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:56.613
(50.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:08.675
Andrew, just go. Please.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:10.794
Not today.

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:15.131
All right.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.094
Try it again next week.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:41.124
Wait!

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.247
- What the hell?
- Run. Run! Run!

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:51.383
Sorry. Wrong place, wrong time.

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:56.016
Shit!

01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:58.675
Andrew!

01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:01.178
Shit.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:05.067
Ed!

01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:10.813
Jj

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.361
Hey, hey!

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:31.629
Shit!

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.760
Son of a bitch!

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.055
Hey! Let it go! Let it go! Let go!

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.540
- Put it down.
- I'm gonna shoot you.

01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:43.849
- Put it on the floor.
- No.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.726
And I'll let you go.

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:48.479
Jesus Christ, what the hell's going on?

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:50.811
Get off!

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:53.188
Christ!

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.239
You think you're gonna get away? Huh?

01:05:58.663 --> 01:05:59.948
Maybe not.

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:03.281
But he might.

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:05.492
You keep your eyes on him.

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:11.081
Jj

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.694
Step aside, Lisa. I got this.

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:38.491
- He's over there.
- I see him.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.405
I think I got him!

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:56.867
You stupid fucking idiot.
What the hell's the matter with you?

01:06:56.930 --> 01:07:00.034
Frank, we discussed this, all right? It's
hurtful when you talk to me like that.

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:01.173
I tried my best. Hell...

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.223
Where is your head?

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:06.348
- Where is your head?!
- Okay, you need to take a yoga class.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:07.975
I don't need to do a fucking thing!

01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:09.543
You're gonna listen to me.
Get in that car.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.683
Get your ass in that fucking...
Get in the car!

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.894
- Get in the car and shut your mouth!
- Decaf.

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:16.024
- Shut... you... what?
- I'm just saying.

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:17.901
- What? Shut up!
- Sleep better.

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:34.589
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.920
Piggy, piggy.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:04.785
We've got you now, pig!

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.497
What are you gonna do now, cop?

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:10.621
Can't let you guys go!

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:15.584
Three of us, one of you!
What do you mean by "let us go"?

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:19.462
Second one of you guys misses,
the other one dies. I promise you that!

01:08:19.554 --> 01:08:21.636
- Fuck you!
- No, baby!

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:30.557
Got you now, you bastard!

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:38.814
Hey...

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:43.942
You and me... you and me.

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:46.698
- Hey...
- You and me against the world, baby.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:49.993
Baby?

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:52.582
Baby!

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.087
Baby?

01:08:58.091 --> 01:08:59.091
Baby?

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.604
Jj

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:07.108
I got you now!

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:12.708
Stop!

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:38.775
Frank?

01:10:39.610 --> 01:10:40.610
Get in!

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.191
Go, man, go!

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.738
Jj

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:58.035
- Thanks for saving my ass.
- No problem.

01:10:58.129 --> 01:10:59.994
That was some driving back there.

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:03.331
- I used to drive a Jeep.
- Yeah, where's that?

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:05.508
- I don't have it anymore.
- Let's go save David.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:13.518
Drive!

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:22.941
Where's Mickey?

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:27.400
Don't.

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:33.368
Right, he's going for the house.

01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:38.874
What about the other cop?

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:44.209
Shit!

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:03.266
Damn, they're right on us.

01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:44.272
Jesus Christ! Try and shoot him!

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.047
Come on! Ah!

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:22.850
Ah! Come on! Goddamn it!

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:31.817
Fuck! Come on!

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:08.308
Seatbelt!

01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:11.276
Come on!

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:13.688
All right, get ready.

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:29.166
I got it, I got it! I got it!

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:37.003
What the fuck was that?

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:40.134
Sounds like a crash.

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:45.474
- You shut up.
- Calm down.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:47.225
Shut up.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.854
I think somebody should help.

01:14:51.862 --> 01:14:53.944
No, I'm not leaving you here on your own!

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:57.235
You can carry me.

01:14:58.536 --> 01:15:00.401
No, I'm not gonna fucking carry you!

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.862
We're just gonna stay here,
and frank, or ed,

01:15:02.957 --> 01:15:05.494
or someone's gonna be back in a minute
and tell us what to do!

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:09.334
Frank? Somebody talk to me!

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:12.630
You know what? Fuck you.

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:21.965
Jj

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:58.293
Eric. Eric, wake up.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.593
Wake up.

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.180
This is for Mickey!

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:16.151
Hey. Snap out of it.

01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:34.245
It's not your time.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.126
I love you.

01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:53.014
Jj

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:07.786
I'm in charge, okay? I'll say... I put
my foot down! I'm saying what's happening!

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:11.415
What you're gonna do is put that gun down.

01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:12.992
Oh, yeah?

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:14.523
Why don't you come make me put it down?

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:15.912
Hm?

01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:20.882
I'm gonna have to kill you.

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:25.762
Stop saying that. Stop saying that. Hey.

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:28.182
Hey, no. No.

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:32.937
I was joking. So sit your...
Sit your ass down on the chair.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:35.977
Come on, now, come on.

01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:38.104
We've done this. We've done this.

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:40.603
Just give me the gun.

01:17:42.449 --> 01:17:45.111
Now, listen. Until frank gets back,
I'm in charge.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:46.908
That's the deal, okay?

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:50.830
So you park your ass on that chair
and then we're all gonna be mates.

01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:52.727
- You wanna sit down?
- I do wanna sit down. Yeah.

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:55.208
Have a cup of tea?

01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:57.833
Just give me the pacifier.

01:18:02.428 --> 01:18:04.635
I'm only sitting down if you sit down.

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:11.134
I'll be happy to sit down.

01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:19.896
I'm just gonna...
I'm probably just gonna...

01:18:19.987 --> 01:18:22.649
Like a squat, sort of...

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.277
So that I'm ready, you know, for anything.

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:27.483
Like a... like a panther.

01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:44.883
Let's go, man. Come on.

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:58.476
Frank, I could really do
with some help in here!

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:01.893
You see this chair right here?

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:04.566
- You see this chair?
- Yeah?

01:19:04.657 --> 01:19:07.524
- All right.
- Hey, hey.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:17.662
I want you to get the fuck out of here!

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:21.245
- And put that gun down.
- Put the chair down.

01:19:31.183 --> 01:19:32.183
Sit the fuck down!

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:34.008
Sit down!

01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:48.940
Fucking... get off me!

01:19:58.335 --> 01:20:00.215
I got a charity to be at.
Let's make this quick.

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:06.916
Jj

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:24.899
The fuck!

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.860
I told you I was gonna kill you.

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:38.364
Just do it, you fucking cunt!

01:20:58.354 --> 01:20:59.969
You're under arrest.

01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:04.351
I'm not too sure about that.

01:21:14.078 --> 01:21:15.818
Well, well, well.

01:21:15.913 --> 01:21:18.575
Isn't it nice to see
the likes of you again?

01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:19.905
You're looking nice and dapper.

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:23.826
All right.

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:27.788
I'm in a hurry.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:30.795
So if you want this to go smooth,

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.717
please enlighten me.

01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:34.386
Where are the other two?

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:41.219
Jj

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:00.947
You hurt?

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:07.336
Oh, no. I'm just peachy.

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.218
I gotta go.

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:16.795
I gotta save David.

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:19.552
I know.

01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:23.639
I got your back.

01:22:24.815 --> 01:22:26.396
You're not going alone.

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:33.062
Let's go get David.

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:34.567
Let's go save him.

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.615
No man left behind.

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:41.612
You left me in the car back there.

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:53.750
- You might need this.
- Oh! Yep.

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:54.959
Ah!

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.923
Well, I've gotta say,

01:23:02.269 --> 01:23:05.978
I didn't expect a shit show
quite like this.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.598
I thought we could contain it, Michael.

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:14.027
You thought? But evidently
you don't think nearly enough.

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:16.530
Where's Mickey?

01:23:16.617 --> 01:23:19.359
That other fucking cop killed him.

01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:22.035
He shot him dead.

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:25.030
Calm yourself.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:27.741
But he was your brother.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.996
He was my stepbrother. Distant.

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:34.957
And I'm sure he made that
abundantly clear to you.

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.794
Nonetheless,
it's a terrible thing.

01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:41.471
Someone needs
to be severely punished.

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:47.595
It's a miracle
we aren't inundated with cops.

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:49.850
You sloppy fucks!

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:57.821
Get the fuck off me!

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.623
I'm sorry.

01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:23.597
You work for this guy?

01:24:24.601 --> 01:24:26.557
You trust him?

01:24:26.645 --> 01:24:28.476
This guy?

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.429
Turn on him!

01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:32.230
I'll protect you.

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.905
Oh, good one.

01:24:55.007 --> 01:24:57.840
And you, frank. My goodness.

01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:59.541
All these years.

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:05.590
I counted on you. I trusted you.
I gave you a chance.

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:11.019
And this is
what I walk into today.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:12.391
Really?

01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:15.770
These guys made you
look like a fucking joke.

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:18.853
I said I was sorry, Michael.

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:21.150
Excuse me?

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:27.657
You might not live to give another apology
in your fucking life!

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:32.499
Do what you're told, take my orders,

01:25:32.586 --> 01:25:35.043
and keep your fucking mouth shut.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:37.917
- Understand?
- Yes.

01:25:38.008 --> 01:25:40.624
Do I need to ask you
to fucking bark for me?

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:51.184
Run, Cal, you idiot!

01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:59.727
Well,
that didn't take very long.

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:02.312
This ends... now.

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:07.119
No.

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:10.488
Leave the kid.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:14.787
Take me!

01:26:16.922 --> 01:26:20.130
What would my mother say

01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:24.335
if I didn't at least try
to avenge my stepbrother?

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:25.635
Hmm?

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.430
This is my farm, bitches.

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:35.690
Call

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:49.286
Shit!

01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:54.115
Jj

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.671
Kill them! After them!

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:03.544
I've got personal business with him!

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:11.511
Get up. Lisa, frank, to the right! Move!

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:14.676
Thomas, get your ass to the left, go!

01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:25.316
- Holy shit, that worked.
- Nice shot.

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:27.272
- Upstairs.
- Let's go. Yeah.

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:30.192
Oh, shit!

01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:38.158
So much for no killing.

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.248
Jj

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:51.175
Oh, David.

01:27:53.643 --> 01:27:55.008
Don't be afraid.

01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:59.350
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:07.487
You rock that pathetic,
shiny, little badge?

01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:09.906
False righteousness.

01:28:09.993 --> 01:28:12.234
You know nothing of real honor.

01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:15.787
What you did to my family...

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:19.620
Hoo-hoo-hoo...

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:21.667
You're in my custody now.

01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:23.120
Hey, Michael.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:28.087
Keep those bullets, buddy.

01:28:28.178 --> 01:28:31.796
Well, guess what? This last one
has your name on it.

01:28:55.789 --> 01:28:57.620
You know I'll be out in a week.

01:28:57.707 --> 01:28:59.322
Say good night.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:06.163
Jj

01:29:46.172 --> 01:29:47.172
Shit.

01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:57.308
Hey.

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:06.064
Drop it!

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:10.648
Run, you idiot!

01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:14.443
Go. Go, go, go!

01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:36.503
Jj

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:02.912
Fucking piece of shit!

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:10.464
Ah!

01:31:35.573 --> 01:31:37.188
You ready to see your wife?

01:31:40.245 --> 01:31:41.610
She'd rather wait.

01:31:41.705 --> 01:31:42.740
Ah!

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.257
You okay?

01:32:05.103 --> 01:32:06.809
I'm gonna take the stairs.

01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:19.356
There you are! Shit.

01:32:21.453 --> 01:32:23.284
Looks like you're out.

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:25.828
Not today, sweetheart. Come here.

01:32:43.141 --> 01:32:45.803
Oh! Oh, well...

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:48.226
Looks like I might
have to do another remodel.

01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:54.725
Yeah. Sorry about that.

01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.310
Eh, it's okay.

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:59.566
I didn't really care
for that wallpaper anyway.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.991
Thanks for the help.

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:07.404
Name's Eric, by the way.

01:33:07.499 --> 01:33:09.615
- Nice to meet you.
- Cal.

01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:12.496
- Stop talking. I didn't do anything.
- Shut up.

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.669
Tell it to the judge.

01:33:17.884 --> 01:33:19.294
I'm calling my lawyer.

01:33:22.138 --> 01:33:25.426
- What are you doing?
- Hell of a day, isn't it, partner?

01:33:27.894 --> 01:33:29.805
You got insurance?

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:33.896
Because your house is shot to shit.

01:33:36.194 --> 01:33:37.274
Yeah.

01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:44.028
- I got shot today.
- So did I.
