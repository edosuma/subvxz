00:02.919 --> 00:05.353
Rebecca, hey, um.

00:06.723 --> 00:10.159
Look, I don't know where you are,
but if you're in L.A.,

00:10.293 --> 00:12.693
Kitty's birth mother just
had the baby at St. Francis,

00:12.829 --> 00:16.321
and I know Kitty would
really like it if you were here.

00:16.466 --> 00:19.594
You know what? Screw that.
I wanna see you.

00:19.736 --> 00:21.636
I miss you.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.619 --> 00:39.110
Clear the way!

00:39.255 --> 00:41.348
Robert McCallister, 44.

00:41.491 --> 00:43.550
Status: Post-syncope.
Went down in a parking garage.

00:43.693 --> 00:45.923
Complains of ongoing chest pain
despite 02 morphine

00:46.062 --> 00:47.120
and supplemental nitro.

00:47.497 --> 00:51.263
Pulse is 140 and thready.
BP, 70/40.

01:02.245 --> 01:04.839
Clear this area, please.
- Did he get any aspirin?

01:04.980 --> 01:06.778
- Yeah, I gave some earlier.
- And you are?

01:06.916 --> 01:08.645
His brother-in-law.
He had a headache.

01:08.785 --> 01:10.582
Lucky headache.
It probably saved his life.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.814
Let's order a CBC,
chem panel, enzymes, troponin

01:13.957 --> 01:16.016
and call Cardiology.

01:16.559 --> 01:19.289
- You need to keep that mask on.
- Kevin.

01:22.198 --> 01:23.324
We need to get out of here.

01:23.466 --> 01:25.024
You still feeling pain in your chest?

01:25.168 --> 01:27.261
We need to get out of here.
What's the pain like?

01:27.403 --> 01:29.803
- I'm fine.
- Dull, sharp? Is it moving anywhere?

01:29.939 --> 01:32.464
- I need to get to the fifth floor.
- His wife's having a baby.

01:32.609 --> 01:35.077
I need to get to the fifth floor.
- This is an emergency.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.043
He's crashing! Somebody bag him.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.448
Where's the crash cart?
Start another IV. Stat.

01:43.987 --> 01:45.454
Clear.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.900
Give me 250 joules.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.267
Got it? Clear.

02:06.009 --> 02:07.943
Ma'am, you need to let
the doctors do their work.

02:08.077 --> 02:12.377
- You have to let me in. I'm family.
- Go to 300 joules.

02:29.866 --> 02:31.299
- Mom.
- Kevin.

02:31.901 --> 02:35.064
God, Kevin.
Sarah told me what happened.

02:35.205 --> 02:38.038
- Where's Kitty? She's not picking up.
- She's with the baby.

02:40.944 --> 02:43.139
Hey, little guy.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.548
Hi, little guy.

02:48.184 --> 02:49.879
Oh, goodness. Oh, goodness.

02:50.019 --> 02:51.884
Okay. Here we go. That's better.

02:52.021 --> 02:55.422
- Kitty.
- Oh, Sarah. Sarah, look.

02:55.558 --> 02:58.686
Look at how incredible he is.

03:00.330 --> 03:01.661
I know. Oh, easy.

03:01.798 --> 03:03.129
Kitty, something's happened.

03:05.401 --> 03:06.891
What?

03:07.036 --> 03:08.765
It's Robert. He's downstairs.

03:08.905 --> 03:11.965
He's had a heart attack.

03:16.946 --> 03:20.382
Here. Take the baby.

03:35.298 --> 03:39.325
- Oh, Mom! Where is he?
They're working on him.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.731
- So he's alive?
- Yeah.

03:40.870 --> 03:43.998
- Look, he wanted to be... He tried to be...
- It doesn't matter.

03:44.140 --> 03:47.507
- Excuse me. I'm Kitty McCallister.
- Your husband's inside.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.702
Okay, thank you.

03:48.845 --> 03:50.472
I'm sorry. You have to wait out here.

03:50.613 --> 03:51.739
Okay.

03:55.285 --> 03:57.446
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the office.

03:57.587 --> 03:59.782
I have to keep this under control.

04:01.057 --> 04:02.786
His EF's markedly decreased.

04:02.926 --> 04:05.053
I wrote for some pressors.
Get them started.

04:05.194 --> 04:07.594
Excuse me. I'm looking
For Robert McCallister.

04:07.730 --> 04:09.163
- Are you his wife?
- Yes.

04:09.299 --> 04:11.199
Good. I'm Dr. Michaels.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.234
I have some questions.
He's still groggy.

04:13.369 --> 04:16.361
- Is he gonna be okay?
- He's had a heart attack.

04:16.973 --> 04:18.440
Does he have any risk factors?

04:18.574 --> 04:20.007
- Smoking?
- No.

04:20.142 --> 04:21.303
- Diabetes?
- No, no.

04:21.444 --> 04:23.378
- High cholesterol?
- No, nothing that I...

04:23.513 --> 04:25.003
Nothing that I know of, no.

04:25.148 --> 04:26.308
What about his family?

04:26.449 --> 04:29.577
Well, his parents
have both passed away,

04:29.719 --> 04:31.619
but not of heart disease,
I don't think.

04:31.754 --> 04:34.985
- Can I see him?
- He needs to be cathed right away.

04:35.124 --> 04:36.921
- Cathed?
- Darlene, call the Cath Lab.

04:37.060 --> 04:40.086
Tell them we're on our way.
So we can evaluate his arteries.

04:40.229 --> 04:42.527
Hopefully, we'll be able
to open up the blockage.

04:42.665 --> 04:45.225
- Is that dangerous?
- It's more dangerous if we don't.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.462
The cardiologist will go over the risks
and the benefits with you.

04:50.907 --> 04:54.035
Wait, wait, wait, Robert.
Robert, it's me.

04:54.177 --> 04:55.974
- It's me.
- I'm sorry.

04:56.112 --> 04:58.603
No, it's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

04:58.748 --> 05:01.615
- The baby?
- Oh, he's perfect.

05:01.751 --> 05:03.946
It's okay. I'll see you soon.

05:04.087 --> 05:06.749
Sorry, we've gotta get him started.

05:23.172 --> 05:25.732
Let me move all of Tommy's junk.

05:25.875 --> 05:28.343
Maybe once we get
this landscaping done,

05:28.478 --> 05:31.675
we can add an office for him. Okay.

05:32.281 --> 05:34.681
So here is a pergola

05:34.817 --> 05:37.183
with a gas-barbecue island
for Tommy.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.788
And over here,
there's this great play structure

05:39.922 --> 05:41.514
with a slide and sandbox.

05:41.657 --> 05:43.022
All this is gonna be grass,

05:43.159 --> 05:45.821
- so Elizabeth can run around.
- When Rebecca was little,

05:45.962 --> 05:48.192
she would've loved to have
a backyard like that.

05:48.331 --> 05:50.765
Well, thanks to Rebecca,
Elizabeth's gonna have one.

05:51.934 --> 05:54.767
- How so?
- Wasn't the Crawford deal her idea?

05:54.904 --> 05:57.065
Ever since then,
Tommy's been in the best mood.

05:57.206 --> 05:59.766
- He says yes to everything.
- Really?

05:59.909 --> 06:02.434
Yeah. He's even talking about
buying me a new car.

06:02.578 --> 06:03.977
Oh.

06:04.814 --> 06:08.511
- Did I say something wrong?
- Look, Julia...

06:12.889 --> 06:15.323
It's Tommy. He's probably
calling about the baby.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.187
Is it a boy or a girl?

06:17.326 --> 06:20.955
It's a boy. What's his name?

06:21.964 --> 06:23.795
Is he all right?

06:25.068 --> 06:28.834
Yeah, of course.
I just need to find a sitter.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.599
Okay, yeah. I'll be there. Bye.

06:31.941 --> 06:33.499
Robert had a heart attack.

06:34.177 --> 06:35.508
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.374
They're doing a procedure on him.

06:37.513 --> 06:40.209
Look, if you need someone
to look after Elizabeth...

06:40.349 --> 06:43.716
- No, you don't have to do that.
- Julia, I'd be happy to. Go.

06:43.853 --> 06:45.753
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

06:46.122 --> 06:48.920
Thank you. Okay, I'll call you
as soon as I know anything.

06:49.058 --> 06:50.184
Don't worry. Go on.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.021
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.366
It was a flat line. No heartbeat, nothing.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.333
They had to shock him
with the paddles.

07:01.471 --> 07:04.907
- Julia's on her way.
- I'm telling you, it was like, beep, nothing.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.406
Mom, let's not focus on that.

07:06.542 --> 07:08.567
The good news is,
is it happened in the ER.

07:08.711 --> 07:11.737
They can bring him back within a few
seconds without any damage.

07:11.881 --> 07:14.008
Doesn't change the fact
that his heart stopped.

07:14.150 --> 07:16.710
- There's gotta be something wrong.
No, not necessarily.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.549
They're probably doing tests on it
to figure out exactly what it is.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.884
And you'd be amazed
how many tools they have

07:22.024 --> 07:26.461
- to fix stenosis or blockages or whatever.
- You learned all that in the Army?

07:26.596 --> 07:28.757
- Yeah.
- What's stenosis?

07:28.898 --> 07:31.423
Stenosis is the narrowing
of the coronary artery.

07:31.567 --> 07:33.967
It's... It's what Dad had.

07:34.103 --> 07:35.661
- And he died of it.
- Yeah, Sarah.

07:35.805 --> 07:38.296
But we don't know that
that's what Robert has.

07:38.441 --> 07:39.874
Mom, he's in good hands, okay?

07:40.009 --> 07:42.534
So let's all just, you know,
relax and chill out

07:42.678 --> 07:45.078
until we know what we're
dealing with, all right?

07:45.214 --> 07:46.841
All right.
I'm gonna go make a phone call.

07:46.983 --> 07:48.814
Yeah, he's right.

07:48.951 --> 07:52.443
You should all just take
a deep breath and relax.

07:52.588 --> 07:54.021
Yeah.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.994
Mom, are you relaxed?

08:00.129 --> 08:03.155
No, I'm not relaxed.
He could be dying in there.

08:06.302 --> 08:09.237
You've got 70 percent stenosis
of the left main coronary.

08:09.372 --> 08:10.430
What's that mean?

08:10.573 --> 08:13.804
That means we need to do a bypass,
and we need to do it now.

08:14.644 --> 08:16.771
What about a stent?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.938
Isn't that what
a lot of people are getting now?

08:19.081 --> 08:22.073
- That's what we've been trying to do, but...
- Well, then try harder.

08:22.785 --> 08:24.582
Look, I know
you're feeling better, but...

08:27.957 --> 08:29.083
Excuse me.

08:29.725 --> 08:31.818
The nurse said that
it would be okay if I...

08:31.961 --> 08:34.929
Of course. I was just explaining

08:35.063 --> 08:36.998
about the degree
of the narrowing, and...

08:37.133 --> 08:38.828
He thinks I need open-heart surgery.

08:39.501 --> 08:41.231
Open-heart surgery?

08:41.370 --> 08:43.201
What would be the recovery time?

08:43.339 --> 08:45.637
Well, you'd have to enter
a cardio rehab program.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.800
Takes, two, three months.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.107
No, no. That's not gonna work.

08:51.247 --> 08:53.044
I just announced
my campaign for governor.

08:53.182 --> 08:55.707
- Campaign? But, Robert...
- I need another option.

08:55.851 --> 08:57.375
Well, there's
an experimental procedure

08:57.520 --> 08:59.385
that doesn't require
going through the sternum.

08:59.522 --> 09:01.547
And you'll have to schedule
two days in advance.

09:01.691 --> 09:03.022
- Let's do it.
No, no, no. Wait.

09:03.159 --> 09:06.424
- Is that what you're recommending?
- No.

09:06.562 --> 09:09.690
Senator, you don't have
that kind of time.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.665
What's the risk? You monitor me.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.862
If something goes wrong,
then we do the bypass.

09:16.005 --> 09:18.269
Doctor, do you think that
you could give us one minute?

09:18.407 --> 09:21.843
Sure, but I've got
the whole team on standby.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.912
The sooner the better.

09:25.881 --> 09:27.815
Robert...

09:29.218 --> 09:31.413
You nearly died today.

09:31.854 --> 09:35.483
- But I didn't.
- Well, you're damn lucky.

09:35.625 --> 09:38.150
My father died
of a heart attack on my birthday,

09:38.294 --> 09:40.854
and now you have one
on the day our son is born.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.431
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna
let history repeat itself.

09:43.566 --> 09:46.126
- I won't.
- I forgot.

09:46.269 --> 09:47.566
Well, of course you did.

09:47.703 --> 09:50.171
You spent your day
going into cardiac arrest,

09:50.306 --> 09:52.331
apparently more than once.

09:53.709 --> 09:56.837
- Kitty, if this gets out...
- No.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.507
You missed the birth of our son.

09:59.649 --> 10:02.982
I'm not gonna let you miss
the rest of his life.

10:03.719 --> 10:05.118
I don't care.

10:05.254 --> 10:06.846
I don't care about your campaign.

10:06.989 --> 10:09.082
I don't care how long
it takes you to recover.

10:09.225 --> 10:12.592
You are going to have this surgery.

10:15.598 --> 10:17.122
Okay.

10:21.170 --> 10:23.570
I'm gonna tell them
that you're ready.

10:25.775 --> 10:28.539
- Okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

10:46.529 --> 10:48.053
What's wrong?

10:50.466 --> 10:52.457
I can't get ahold of Rebecca.

10:53.669 --> 10:56.331
And if I don't talk to her soon, Ma,
I'm gonna go crazy.

10:57.306 --> 10:59.240
Have you told her about Ryan yet?

10:59.375 --> 11:01.343
No, Mom.

11:01.477 --> 11:05.106
Well, I'm just sorry
she wasn't here today

11:05.247 --> 11:07.181
to see you in action.

11:07.316 --> 11:10.342
- I didn't do anything.
- You were so calm,

11:10.486 --> 11:12.283
explaining everything to everyone.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.616
I forgot how good you are
in a crisis.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.817
Mom, you forgot because I'm the one
usually causing the crisis.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.291
Well, that's not tr...

11:19.729 --> 11:22.823
Why is it so hard for you
to accept a compliment?

11:22.965 --> 11:25.263
Okay, thank you
for your completely biased

11:25.401 --> 11:28.564
and totally unearned
good opinion of me.

11:30.039 --> 11:33.440
Was it something I did as a mother
to make you like this?

11:33.576 --> 11:35.476
Mom, please don't do
the guilt thing, all right?

11:35.611 --> 11:37.977
I became an unemployed drug addict
all by myself.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.809
- Ex-drug addict.
- Recovering drug addict.

11:39.949 --> 11:43.316
You are completely incapable of seeing
any of your own good qualities.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.886
And as far as being unemployed,
that's not your fault.

11:46.021 --> 11:47.818
Mom, stop making excuses for me.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.187
Can't you see what I really am, Mom?

11:50.326 --> 11:53.625
I see you. I see you.

11:54.330 --> 11:56.628
I see a smart, brave,
compassionate man

11:56.766 --> 11:57.824
who dropped out of school

11:57.967 --> 12:00.561
and gave some of the most
important years of his life to the Army.

12:00.703 --> 12:02.432
That's what I see.

12:02.571 --> 12:05.335
While all of your friends were
in college finding themselves,

12:05.474 --> 12:07.965
you were serving your country
in Afghanistan and Iraq.

12:08.110 --> 12:11.079
You never had a chance to
find out what you're good at.

12:15.384 --> 12:16.976
Maybe.

12:17.386 --> 12:20.287
You deserve that chance, Justin.

12:21.357 --> 12:24.554
The sad thing is, the only one
who thinks you don't is you.

12:27.396 --> 12:29.796
I don't understand how
a guy so young and fit

12:29.932 --> 12:31.422
- has a heart attack.
- I know.

12:31.567 --> 12:33.865
It's crazy.
Justin said it could be hereditary.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.566
- Hey, you made it.
I just got here.

12:38.073 --> 12:40.132
- How's Kitty?
- She's, uh, hanging in there.

12:40.276 --> 12:42.210
She's pretty much running
on pure adrenaline now.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.006
- Yeah. Where's Elizabeth?
- She's with Holly, believe it or not.

12:45.147 --> 12:47.672
- Holly?
- Yeah, um, she stopped by to see you...

12:47.817 --> 12:50.251
Wait, so hold on.
Holly's alone at our house?

12:50.386 --> 12:52.081
- Yeah, she offered.
- What's the big deal?

12:52.221 --> 12:54.280
I like to keep my private life
and my work separate.

12:54.423 --> 12:57.824
- Is that so hard to understand?
- Okay, fine. I'll call a sitter.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.087
No, no, no. I'll do it.

13:02.598 --> 13:03.963
Did I do something wrong?

13:04.834 --> 13:07.302
No. You know,
we're all pretty stressed out.

13:07.436 --> 13:08.562
He'll be fine.

13:24.453 --> 13:26.182
I feel like I haven't seen you in years.

13:26.322 --> 13:28.347
- You poor thing. Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

13:28.491 --> 13:31.460
My phone died. I think I killed it,
you know, trying to make so many calls.

13:31.594 --> 13:33.391
Can I borrow yours?
I need to call the office.

13:33.529 --> 13:36.191
They need to fax a bunch
of confidentiality agreements.

13:36.332 --> 13:38.926
Okay, can you at least
tell me what happened, first?

13:41.003 --> 13:42.937
Yeah. Robert had a heart attack.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.597
You know, one minute he was fine,
the next he collapsed,

13:45.741 --> 13:48.232
and we called him an ambulance.

13:48.944 --> 13:52.141
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?

13:52.281 --> 13:54.806
You know, that I thought
he was gonna die?

13:54.950 --> 13:57.145
That I thought I was gonna
have to stand there

13:57.286 --> 13:59.982
and watch him die, and, you know,
not be able to help?

14:00.122 --> 14:01.783
But you did help him.
You got him here.

14:03.359 --> 14:05.884
You know, in the ambulance
when they were working on him,

14:06.428 --> 14:08.988
the EMT kept saying to me:

14:10.799 --> 14:12.391
"Your friend... Your...

14:12.535 --> 14:15.095
Your friend is gonna be okay. "

14:17.473 --> 14:22.206
I didn't even like him when
he became my brother-in-law.

14:23.312 --> 14:26.770
And now that he is my friend,
and God knows how that happened,

14:28.551 --> 14:30.883
I can't bear the thought of losing him.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.988
But the EMT said
he was gonna be fine.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.522
Yeah, that was before
his heart stopped.

14:36.492 --> 14:38.517
I mean,
what if that happens again?

14:38.661 --> 14:40.629
They'll take care of him.

14:44.433 --> 14:49.336
You know, your friend has a new son.
And you have a new nephew.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.268
- Have you seen him?
- Mm-hm.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.708
And I think you better meet him
before you do anything else.

14:56.946 --> 14:58.914
I don't feel presentable right now.

14:59.048 --> 15:02.484
It's okay. He won't mind.
He's all blotchy too.

15:04.420 --> 15:05.887
Here.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.228
<i>- Hello.
Hey, Holly. It's Tommy.</i>

15:15.364 --> 15:16.991
<i>- How's Robert?
- We don't know yet.</i>

15:17.132 --> 15:18.497
He's still in surgery.

15:18.634 --> 15:21.603
It was really nice of you to offer
to sit with Elizabeth. Thanks.

15:21.737 --> 15:25.400
<i>- So, um, everything's fine?
- Yeah.</i>

15:26.342 --> 15:29.505
Julia said that you had something
you wanted to talk to me about.

15:29.645 --> 15:34.139
- Well, it can wait till tomorrow.
- Good.

15:34.283 --> 15:37.275
Uh, listen, I'm sure
you've got lots to do today,

15:37.419 --> 15:39.353
so I called our regular babysitter.

15:39.488 --> 15:42.719
I told her to hurry. She's on her way.

15:43.759 --> 15:45.727
Relax, Tommy. I'm fine.

15:45.861 --> 15:49.627
Okay. Thanks, um...

15:49.765 --> 15:52.563
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay. Bye.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.205
Any news?

16:04.346 --> 16:05.745
Um, mm-mm.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.907
Honey, can I do anything for you?
Can I make any calls or anything?

16:09.051 --> 16:14.079
No, no. I called Robert's brother,
and I left a message for Courtney.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.918
Well, if she calls back,
hand me the phone.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.650
The last thing you need
to do right now

16:17.793 --> 16:20.591
- is talk to his ex-wife.
- It's fine.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.555
- Have you told Trish yet?
- I did.

16:25.167 --> 16:27.465
I did, and she downplayed it.

16:28.671 --> 16:32.368
She said that bypass surgery
was run-of-the-mill these days,

16:32.508 --> 16:35.068
and she warned me
that I would have two babies

16:35.210 --> 16:38.145
to take care of after the surgery.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.044
She's right.
Men make awful patients.

16:41.183 --> 16:43.310
Yeah.

16:43.852 --> 16:45.843
Yeah, if he comes home.

16:45.988 --> 16:48.616
Oh, Kitty, stop it.
He's gonna make it home.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.486
We don't know that.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.955
It's funny. I never thought... I...

16:55.164 --> 16:57.132
I never even worried.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.257
I just assumed.

17:01.737 --> 17:07.698
I just keep thinking about
how mad I've been at him,

17:08.644 --> 17:10.474
and all this arguing,

17:10.612 --> 17:13.273
all this fighting over
the article and the campaigning,

17:13.415 --> 17:14.473
it just all just...

17:14.616 --> 17:17.642
It all just seems so stupid now.

17:19.221 --> 17:22.816
I just don't want that
to be my memory of him.

17:22.958 --> 17:26.051
I just want one more moment,

17:27.162 --> 17:29.528
just one minute, just to hold him.

17:29.665 --> 17:32.259
I just wanna hold him,

17:32.401 --> 17:35.268
and I wanna tell him that
he means everything to me.

17:35.404 --> 17:38.339
- He knows that.
- I know he does.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.339
But I need it.

17:41.677 --> 17:43.372
I need it.

17:44.747 --> 17:47.443
Oh, God, just please
give me one more moment.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.813
Just give me one moment.

17:51.487 --> 17:55.981
Oh, just give me
one more moment, please.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.194
Hey, Mom.
I can't really talk right now.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.464
You don't have to worry about me
anymore. I am going to be fine.

18:10.606 --> 18:12.301
- Wait, what do you mean?
- I've got him.

18:12.441 --> 18:15.376
- Who?
- Tommy. Do you know what he did?

18:15.511 --> 18:18.571
He stole from the company
to buy the land.

18:18.714 --> 18:20.807
<i>- I found the proof.
- Are you sure?</i>

18:20.949 --> 18:23.247
It is all right here.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.485
Wait, that's the babysitter.
I've gotta go.

18:26.622 --> 18:29.750
Listen, don't say anything
to anybody. Not a word.

18:29.892 --> 18:32.588
- I love you, sweetie.
- Bye.

18:41.303 --> 18:44.534
- I'm sorry I didn't call.
- It's okay.

18:44.673 --> 18:46.368
Oh, it's okay.

18:47.976 --> 18:49.500
I missed you.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.480
<i>First of all, I don't believe
he would do something like that.</i>

18:53.615 --> 18:55.173
Well, would you just
try talking to him?

18:55.317 --> 18:57.046
- He won't tell me anything.
- And say what?

18:57.186 --> 18:59.154
Say that we think he's
trying to get rid of Holly,

18:59.288 --> 19:00.846
and he can't break the law
to do it.

19:00.989 --> 19:03.219
Sarah, Robert is having
bypass surgery.

19:03.358 --> 19:05.383
I don't have a place in my brain
for this right now.

19:05.527 --> 19:07.358
- He's your brother.
- Yeah, so is Robert,

19:07.496 --> 19:10.397
and it's my job to make sure this
whole thing doesn't destroy his career.

19:10.532 --> 19:14.468
- I really don't have time for this.
- Kevin, I am really worried about him.

19:14.603 --> 19:17.470
- And I don't know what to do.
- Then let me give you some legal advice.

19:17.606 --> 19:18.834
If what you think is true,

19:18.974 --> 19:21.943
you don't wanna be
within ten miles of him.

19:33.455 --> 19:36.049
Hey, I was just thinking about you.
- You were?

19:36.191 --> 19:40.025
Yeah, I'm here trying to figure out your
ridiculously convoluted cable system.

19:40.162 --> 19:41.424
<i>Are you all right?</i>

19:41.563 --> 19:43.588
No, I just saw Justin,
and I don't know what to do.

19:43.732 --> 19:46.633
<i>- If I let him know what's going on...
- Rebecca, I talked to your mother,</i>

19:46.768 --> 19:49.202
and she's gonna walk away
from the whole thing.

19:49.338 --> 19:52.705
<i>- When did she tell you that?
- I don't know. A couple of hours ago.</i>

19:52.841 --> 19:55.002
But I just talked to her.
She said she found something.

19:55.143 --> 19:58.078
- She can prove Tommy broke the law.
- What exactly did she say to you?

19:58.213 --> 20:00.010
That's all she said.
What am I supposed to do?

20:00.148 --> 20:01.740
I wanna be with Justin,
I know that now,

20:01.884 --> 20:03.977
and if she does this,
I'm gonna have to take sides.

20:04.586 --> 20:06.554
<i>Justin's gonna be
caught in the middle too.</i>

20:06.688 --> 20:08.713
<i>The Walkers will band together.
That's what they do.</i>

20:09.658 --> 20:11.751
I don't wanna lose him.

20:12.861 --> 20:14.294
I'm in love with him.

20:14.429 --> 20:16.329
<i>Well, that's all you need to know.</i>

20:16.465 --> 20:18.729
Okay? That's the only thing
that really matters.

20:18.867 --> 20:21.859
- You really believe that?
- I do.

20:22.004 --> 20:23.665
Okay.

20:32.180 --> 20:33.875
Hey, Scotty. This is yours.

20:34.016 --> 20:36.450
Oh, thanks, Tommy. I didn't
realize how hungry I was.

20:36.585 --> 20:39.315
- Yeah. Here, babe. I got this for you.
- You still mad at me?

20:39.454 --> 20:41.422
- No, I'm fine.
- Tell me why you got...

20:41.556 --> 20:44.491
Kev, uh, pastrami.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.986
- What, is that a problem?
- No.

20:50.365 --> 20:52.424
- Hey, everybody.
Rebecca.

20:52.567 --> 20:54.330
You're here.
Hey, you're back.

20:54.469 --> 20:56.437
- Tommy.
- Does this mean you're coming to work?

20:56.571 --> 20:59.597
- Yeah, I was planning on it.
- Great. Well, we've missed you.

20:59.741 --> 21:02.232
- There's food if you want some.
Thank you.

21:03.545 --> 21:04.944
So Rebecca's back?

21:07.249 --> 21:09.046
Mom, I know you're not hungry,

21:09.184 --> 21:12.210
so I got you
one of those soy chai lattes.

21:13.922 --> 21:16.789
Saul, we need to talk.

21:16.925 --> 21:18.017
Sarah, not now.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.924
I need to know
everything you know about...

21:21.063 --> 21:23.896
- Just not now.
Hey, guys.

21:24.032 --> 21:26.125
Hey, so, uh, Robert's out of surgery,

21:26.268 --> 21:28.259
and the doctor said
it went really well,

21:28.403 --> 21:32.362
- and that they couldn't be happier.
Oh, that's fantastic.

21:32.507 --> 21:36.136
- Oh, my God. What a relief.
- That's great, man.

21:36.278 --> 21:38.508
I knew it.
Oh, God.

22:04.006 --> 22:07.407
The doctor said that you made it through
with flying colors.

22:11.346 --> 22:14.110
We're all gonna be fine, Robert.

22:17.119 --> 22:18.814
And everything is gonna be okay.

22:18.954 --> 22:20.819
Everything is gonna be okay.

22:20.956 --> 22:22.548
You're gonna be fine.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.329
Well, he said that he thought

22:30.465 --> 22:33.229
that Robert was going to make
a complete recovery, so...

22:33.368 --> 22:36.496
Well, he's definitely
in good hands here.

22:36.638 --> 22:39.163
They have one of the best
cardiac rehab programs

22:39.307 --> 22:41.537
- in Los Angeles.
- Right, right. Good.

22:41.676 --> 22:43.974
Trish, I can't believe
they're releasing you.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.342
Every time I gave birth,
they kept me in here a month.

22:46.481 --> 22:48.210
Are you sure
that you're feeling well enough

22:48.350 --> 22:51.114
- to go home so soon?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

22:51.253 --> 22:53.619
I'm a little sore,
but in case you haven't noticed,

22:53.755 --> 22:56.053
I'm not exactly in
my comfort zone as a patient.

22:57.125 --> 23:01.562
- I noticed.
- So, uh, thanks for the ice chips

23:01.696 --> 23:05.393
and the distracting stories.

23:06.234 --> 23:07.496
Well, it's the least I can do,

23:07.636 --> 23:10.628
considering everything
you've done for my daughter.

23:11.106 --> 23:14.337
I'm gonna go check on the baby.

23:16.411 --> 23:22.577
You know, um, Trish, I know that we agreed
to sending pictures once a month, but...

23:24.286 --> 23:28.279
But I don't know, I thought that maybe if
you wanted to check in from time to time...

23:28.423 --> 23:30.891
It's all right.
The terms we agreed to are fine.

23:31.026 --> 23:34.962
Okay, fine. Great.
We'll just keep it the way it is.

23:35.097 --> 23:38.089
You know, I'm supposed to wait
to be escorted out by a wheelchair,

23:38.233 --> 23:40.531
but, uh, I'm walking out.

23:41.603 --> 23:43.571
Serves them right
for not giving me that epidural.

23:45.674 --> 23:50.373
- Goodbye, Kitty.
- Bye, Trish.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.843
Trish.

23:53.982 --> 23:55.472
Thank you.

24:01.957 --> 24:06.053
- I know you wanna get out of here.
- The sooner the better.

24:06.194 --> 24:09.493
Recovery is a process. It takes time.

24:09.631 --> 24:12.122
Once you're discharged,
you'll start a 12-week program.

24:12.267 --> 24:16.260
Now, within that period,
there is no driving, no sex, no work.

24:16.404 --> 24:18.429
How about two out of the three?

24:18.573 --> 24:22.009
Senator, this is very serious.

24:22.144 --> 24:24.305
Avoiding stress
is easier said than done.

24:24.446 --> 24:27.938
But the only job you have right now
is working on your recovery.

24:28.083 --> 24:32.645
- Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that...
No, no. We're done here.

24:32.787 --> 24:34.687
Okay, thank you.

24:35.524 --> 24:37.287
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:37.425 --> 24:39.086
Somebody wants to meet you.

24:39.227 --> 24:42.287
Not as bad as I wanna meet him.

24:43.398 --> 24:46.299
Oh, you know what, honey?
If you're in pain, we can do this later.

24:46.434 --> 24:49.335
No, bring him over here.
It'll make all the pain go away.

24:51.173 --> 24:54.006
There you go. Look.

24:55.443 --> 24:57.468
That's your daddy.

24:59.681 --> 25:01.512
- Oh, look at him.
- Yeah.

25:02.384 --> 25:04.079
I forgot

25:04.819 --> 25:07.185
how little newborns are.

25:07.556 --> 25:09.524
I know.

25:10.859 --> 25:12.383
Okay, okay. Shh.

25:12.527 --> 25:14.017
- It's okay.
- Hey, he needs a name.

25:14.563 --> 25:17.862
- He does.
- What's it gonna be, Connor or Ben?

25:17.999 --> 25:19.193
I had an idea.

25:20.035 --> 25:23.027
You know, Trish gave us this gift,

25:23.171 --> 25:25.935
and I thought maybe it would be nice
if we honored her.

25:26.074 --> 25:29.202
I think naming him Trish
would be child abuse.

25:29.344 --> 25:32.404
- Trish Evans.
- Evan?

25:32.547 --> 25:36.005
Yeah. It means peaceful warrior.

25:36.885 --> 25:38.750
What do you think, Evan?

25:40.388 --> 25:41.753
Evan McCallister.

25:41.890 --> 25:45.656
Well, Evan Walker McCallister.

25:45.794 --> 25:48.160
Hey, come sit with your daddy.

25:58.673 --> 26:01.335
Damn it, Saul. I told you
to just keep your mouth shut.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.842
No, Tommy. I'm not making that
mistake again. Sarah's right.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.379
Sarah doesn't know.
You don't even work there anymore.

26:06.514 --> 26:08.846
Despite where I get my paycheck,
Tommy, I still care.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.612
- Ojai was home for all of us.
Yeah, well, guess what.

26:11.753 --> 26:14.881
It's not gonna be anybody's home but
Holly's if we don't do something about it.

26:15.023 --> 26:17.719
- You said that you hated her, right?
- Not enough to break the law.

26:17.859 --> 26:20.123
She's stealing our company from us.

26:20.262 --> 26:22.526
- What, you guys don't even care?
- Of course we care.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.359
But you're not in this alone.

26:24.499 --> 26:27.263
- There are other ways to get rid of Holly.
- But I am alone, Saul.

26:27.402 --> 26:29.700
- It's just me there. That's it.
- Is that what you think,

26:29.838 --> 26:32.329
because we're not in the building,
that you're alone in this?

26:32.474 --> 26:35.773
I do, and you know what? I hate it.

26:36.211 --> 26:38.076
I want it to be the way it used to be,

26:38.213 --> 26:40.204
so that there's something left
for Elizabeth,

26:41.082 --> 26:43.812
for Paige and Cooper
and for Kitty's baby.

26:43.952 --> 26:48.582
- And I want Ojai to be ours again.
- Not this way, Tommy.

26:48.723 --> 26:50.748
I can't go back
under these circumstances.

26:50.892 --> 26:52.018
Don't you see?

26:52.260 --> 26:56.594
I'm just doing what Dad would've done.
I'm taking a page out of his book.

26:56.731 --> 26:59.359
But it isn't you, Tommy.
If you're determined to be Dad,

26:59.501 --> 27:02.095
then honor what was best about him
and just forget about the rest.

27:03.138 --> 27:05.003
I want it to be like it was too,

27:05.140 --> 27:08.109
but what I remember about Ojai
are the orchards where we played.

27:08.243 --> 27:11.644
I remember the joy. That's what matters.
The rest is just money.

27:11.780 --> 27:14.214
The only thing that you owe this family,

27:14.349 --> 27:17.512
the only thing you owe yourself,
Tommy, is your integrity.

27:17.652 --> 27:21.986
Just... I'm begging you,
don't sell your soul for this.

27:23.291 --> 27:25.953
Well, um, it's too late.

27:26.094 --> 27:29.928
The board meeting's tomorrow.

27:30.565 --> 27:33.659
Nothing that's done can't be undone.

27:33.802 --> 27:35.326
Nothing.

27:41.643 --> 27:43.304
Hey.
- Hey.

27:43.445 --> 27:46.937
- I heard you were leaving.
- Yeah, yeah, I guess.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.107
Mom went to figure out
some last-minute details,

27:49.250 --> 27:51.411
and she's gonna help me
get Evan settled.

27:51.553 --> 27:53.020
- Evan?
- Yeah.

27:53.154 --> 27:58.114
It's strong, dignified. No cruel
nicknames spring to mind. I approve.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.920
Oh, well, good. I'm glad.

28:00.729 --> 28:06.531
Okay, listen, um, Kev, I just wanna say
thank you for everything.

28:06.668 --> 28:08.863
Look, I just wish I could've
done something differently.

28:09.003 --> 28:11.904
Oh, no. Come on, you were great.
And it just really means a lot to me.

28:12.040 --> 28:16.340
Well, I never thought I'd say it, but,
you know, he's kind of an amazing guy.

28:16.911 --> 28:18.776
Wow. Don't tell me
you're gonna change parties.

28:18.913 --> 28:20.540
No, I'm not, but believe it or not,

28:20.682 --> 28:23.879
there are two Republicans
in this world who I love.

28:27.021 --> 28:29.581
Yeah. Well, you know, we're gonna
have to work really hard

28:29.724 --> 28:31.851
to take care of him,
though he's not gonna want us to.

28:31.993 --> 28:35.292
- We have to get him to slow down.
- That might be harder.

28:35.430 --> 28:39.799
- Yeah, believe me. I know that. That's...
- Okay, do you want the striped onesies,

28:39.934 --> 28:41.697
or the ones with the little fire trucks?

28:41.836 --> 28:44.327
Mom, it doesn't matter
what we take him home in.

28:44.472 --> 28:46.599
You say that now. Wait till
you're watching the video.

28:46.741 --> 28:49.301
- Oh, okay. Um, striped. Stripes.
Yeah.

28:49.444 --> 28:50.968
Striped.

28:51.112 --> 28:53.239
Look, go. I've got him.
I'll take care of him.

28:53.381 --> 28:56.646
Yeah, okay. Bye.

29:10.031 --> 29:11.464
- Hey.
Hey.

29:11.599 --> 29:13.123
Come in.

29:19.174 --> 29:20.402
What?

29:20.542 --> 29:24.171
- Do I look that bad?
- Oh, no, no.

29:24.712 --> 29:28.614
I mean, you know, I wouldn't schedule
a TV appearance for tomorrow...

29:31.152 --> 29:34.849
Sorry. So much for laughter
being the best medicine.

29:34.989 --> 29:36.115
How you feeling?

29:36.257 --> 29:38.851
As good as I can feel
after open-heart surgery,

29:38.993 --> 29:40.790
the doctors say.

29:42.363 --> 29:44.524
Has any of this leaked?

29:44.732 --> 29:47.360
There's rumors. They're circling.

29:47.502 --> 29:50.733
- But I'll deal with the press tonight.
- Good.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.574
Good.

29:57.512 --> 29:58.877
It was a minor incident.

29:59.013 --> 30:01.038
A minor incident?
No, come on, Robert.

30:01.182 --> 30:03.742
We give them that
for this news cycle,

30:03.885 --> 30:05.853
it burns itself out,

30:05.987 --> 30:09.388
then later we give them
the heart attack

30:09.524 --> 30:12.152
when people have stopped caring.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.059
Are you still planning to run?

30:17.165 --> 30:18.792
More than ever.

30:19.667 --> 30:23.228
Robert, you almost died.
You... In fact, you did die.

30:23.371 --> 30:26.067
- If you hadn't been in the ER when...
- I know what happened.

30:26.207 --> 30:27.970
Right. And you still think
you can do this?

30:30.712 --> 30:32.873
This is who I am.

30:33.681 --> 30:36.172
A heart attack doesn't change that.

30:36.918 --> 30:40.581
- And I know it's gonna take some time.
- You know what?

30:40.722 --> 30:44.089
I really don't think now is the time
to make any kind of decisions.

30:44.225 --> 30:46.090
There's nothing to decide.

30:47.695 --> 30:50.892
Kevin, I need you now more than ever,

30:51.733 --> 30:55.669
because I am coming back.

31:01.142 --> 31:03.042
Nothing changes.

31:14.923 --> 31:16.515
Oh, you're here.

31:16.658 --> 31:20.389
Hey, uh, you know that board meeting
I put in the books?

31:20.528 --> 31:22.428
I need you to cancel it.

31:22.564 --> 31:26.364
Okay. Was there another day
that was good for you?

31:26.501 --> 31:29.868
No. Just, uh, cancel it.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.747
Back to work already?

31:41.282 --> 31:44.649
Just, uh, tying up some loose ends
before I go home.

31:44.786 --> 31:47.311
- How's Robert?
- Looks like he's gonna be fine.

31:47.956 --> 31:50.390
That's good news. And the baby?

31:51.025 --> 31:53.585
- A boy. Evan.
- Wow.

31:54.629 --> 31:56.722
It's quite a day for your family.

31:58.132 --> 32:00.965
Yeah, uh.
Look, I was just checking in, so...

32:01.102 --> 32:04.538
Um, Tommy, could I ask you a question?

32:04.806 --> 32:06.398
Yeah. Shoot.

32:07.408 --> 32:10.241
Things are going well,
for us, I mean,

32:10.378 --> 32:12.869
for Ojai Foods, for Walker Landing,

32:13.014 --> 32:16.415
which is quite a feat
in this economic climate,

32:16.551 --> 32:18.280
don't you think?

32:18.419 --> 32:21.786
- We've been very lucky, yes.
- And smart.

32:21.923 --> 32:25.017
I mean, we have made
some really smart decisions.

32:25.159 --> 32:27.684
You don't need to worry,
if that's what you're getting at.

32:28.429 --> 32:33.799
But I do need to worry, because
that's just not enough, is it?

32:33.935 --> 32:37.132
I guess it was just
a matter of time for me

32:37.271 --> 32:39.432
until you figured on a way to do it.

32:41.242 --> 32:43.642
I know, Tommy.

32:44.879 --> 32:48.906
I know that you embezzled
$2 million from this company

32:49.050 --> 32:50.540
to buy Crawford Orchards.

32:50.685 --> 32:54.985
I know that Omni Inc.
Is a front that you created

32:55.123 --> 32:57.455
so that you could
sell the land back to Ojai,

32:57.592 --> 32:59.457
knowing that we would pay
in shares

32:59.594 --> 33:01.721
and you would get control
of the company.

33:02.163 --> 33:04.222
And then what were you gonna do,

33:04.365 --> 33:07.630
just toss me to the curb
and put the money back in?

33:07.769 --> 33:09.600
Holly, listen to me...

33:10.071 --> 33:12.904
I have all the information that I need.

33:13.041 --> 33:16.943
- I wasn't gonna go through with this.
- And you expect me to believe that?

33:17.211 --> 33:18.974
- Holly...
- Don't.

33:20.515 --> 33:24.246
Desperation is so unappealing.

33:33.961 --> 33:37.328
Well, here we are.
This is Mommy and Daddy's room.

33:37.465 --> 33:41.196
And it's gonna be your room,
for a little while anyway.

33:41.335 --> 33:46.102
And this is your bassinet over
here. This is where you will sleep a lot.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.071
A lot, a lot, a lot, huh, Evan?

33:48.209 --> 33:50.939
I think I'm gonna change him, Mom.
Good. I'll catch it on camera.

33:51.079 --> 33:54.014
- You know what? I think it's enough.
This is a monumental occasion.

33:54.148 --> 33:56.844
Mom, I'm starting to feel like
I'm on a reality TV show.

33:56.984 --> 33:59.817
Well, if you want Robert to miss it.
- Oh, he's not gonna miss it.

33:59.954 --> 34:02.218
Okay? Please. There's gonna be
so many diapers to change.

34:02.356 --> 34:04.984
He's gonna be changing diapers
over and over and over again.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.821
All right.

34:07.962 --> 34:10.829
But be careful of that little penis.
It's a sprinkler system.

34:10.965 --> 34:13.364
Don't worry, because I have this.

34:13.801 --> 34:16.099
- What the hell is that?
- A pee-pee teepee.

34:16.603 --> 34:19.801
- I just used a towel.
- Well, times have changed.

34:19.940 --> 34:21.408
Yeah.

34:23.411 --> 34:24.810
I'm proud of you, Kitty.

34:24.946 --> 34:27.210
Oh, what, for learning
how to change a diaper?

34:27.348 --> 34:29.646
Well, yes, that too.

34:31.185 --> 34:34.348
Mostly for getting through
the past two days

34:34.489 --> 34:36.150
with such dignity and grace.

34:36.290 --> 34:39.690
Oh, please.
I'm just good at multitasking.

34:41.027 --> 34:45.522
- You're gonna be a great mother.
- Learned it all from you.

34:48.703 --> 34:50.637
Let's go to bed.

34:51.806 --> 34:53.831
There you go.

34:54.442 --> 34:56.103
There you go.

34:56.244 --> 34:57.711
Nighty-night-night.

34:57.845 --> 34:59.710
Oh, wow.

35:00.715 --> 35:03.650
- I can't believe he's here.
- He's home.

35:05.086 --> 35:06.678
Finally.

35:06.821 --> 35:09.153
- Why don't you lie down?
- No, you know, I'm okay.

35:09.290 --> 35:13.124
Rule number one:
When the baby naps, you nap.

35:14.428 --> 35:17.761
Okay. I will, I will.

35:20.268 --> 35:21.701
In a minute.

35:24.639 --> 35:26.607
Hey, there you go.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.780
Hey, are you sure
your mom won't mind?

35:34.916 --> 35:38.818
Are you kidding me?
She's always telling me to eat.

35:39.587 --> 35:42.613
All right, come on.
Come on in, have a seat.

35:42.757 --> 35:45.385
Get some dinner.

35:45.526 --> 35:47.255
Okay. What do we got?

35:47.395 --> 35:50.831
We got some broccoli,
onions, spaghetti sauce,

35:50.965 --> 35:52.899
some mushrooms.

35:53.034 --> 35:55.002
God, my mom's fridge is amazing.

35:55.136 --> 35:58.503
All right. You know,
I think we deserve this.

35:58.639 --> 36:02.905
We deserve a well-cooked meal
after eating all that hospital cafeteria food.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.244
We can call this
your "welcome home" dinner.

36:08.783 --> 36:10.648
Oh, no. Is it the onion?

36:11.085 --> 36:12.985
No, um. No.

36:13.120 --> 36:17.250
- Well, what is it? Is something wrong?
- No, it's the opposite, um.

36:17.992 --> 36:19.983
I just... I wanna tell you something.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.259
I have something to tell you too,

36:22.396 --> 36:24.694
- but you're probably gonna laugh...
- Why would I do that?

36:24.832 --> 36:26.299
- No, you go first.
- No, no, no, go.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.595
- No, no, go.
- No, tell me. Justin, tell me.

36:28.936 --> 36:30.369
Okay.

36:32.874 --> 36:34.637
So you remember
when we were at the hospital,

36:34.775 --> 36:36.242
and there's all this chaos around?

36:36.377 --> 36:39.210
We're around all these people that
are fighting for their lives,

36:39.347 --> 36:42.407
and some are gonna make it,
and some aren't.

36:42.717 --> 36:44.810
It really reminded me
about how I felt in Iraq.

36:44.952 --> 36:47.785
- My God, Justin. I didn't realize...
- No, no, no. It's a good thing.

36:47.922 --> 36:51.790
That's the point, is everybody
there had a purpose.

36:51.926 --> 36:54.986
And I feel like
I haven't had a purpose since...

36:55.396 --> 36:58.797
- Since I was a medic.
- Yeah?

37:00.735 --> 37:04.136
I wanna be a doctor.
And I know it sounds crazy,

37:04.272 --> 37:07.799
- and it's probably gonna take me forever...
- No, that doesn't sound crazy at all.

37:07.942 --> 37:12.072
- I just wanna be someone you're proud of.
- Justin, I'm proud of you all the time.

37:12.213 --> 37:15.842
I mean, I am now,
but you'd be an amazing doctor.

37:15.983 --> 37:18.451
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:18.686 --> 37:20.984
Oh, God. You know, I thought
it was gonna sound ridiculous

37:21.122 --> 37:23.920
- when it actually came out of my mouth.
- No, you should do it.

37:24.158 --> 37:28.822
I'm going to. I mean, I'm gonna try.
You know, me and school...

37:31.132 --> 37:33.362
Oh, uh, what were you gonna tell me?

37:34.035 --> 37:38.096
Uh, nothing. Nothing. It doesn't matter.

37:38.239 --> 37:42.403
- You sure?
- Yeah. This is what matters.

37:51.552 --> 37:54.715
You keep sleeping. I'll walk him around.

37:55.523 --> 37:58.185
<i>We've been hearing all day
of a possibly serious health problem.</i>

37:58.326 --> 38:01.124
<i>Coming up, we'll take you to St. Francis
Hospital for an announcement</i>

38:01.262 --> 38:03.321
<i>from Senator Robert McCallister's
spokesman.</i>

38:03.464 --> 38:05.056
<i>That's after the break. Stay with us.</i>

38:21.449 --> 38:23.110
You didn't call.

38:23.617 --> 38:25.312
David.

38:42.169 --> 38:46.037
I am very pleased to announce
that as of 4:34 yesterday,

38:46.173 --> 38:50.041
Senator McCallister and his wife,
my sister, Kitty Walker McCallister,

38:50.177 --> 38:51.838
became the proud parents

38:51.979 --> 38:57.246
<i>of a very healthy, beautiful baby boy,
Evan Walker McCallister.</i>

38:57.385 --> 39:00.650
<i>Now, there have been some rumors
about the senator's health,</i>

39:00.788 --> 39:04.519
<i>and I would like to clarify.
Upon arrival at the hospital,</i>

39:04.658 --> 39:08.025
<i>the senator was treated
for a heart irregularity.</i>

39:08.162 --> 39:11.029
<i>He underwent some routine tests.</i>

39:11.932 --> 39:14.594
As soon as these results become
available, we will release them.

39:14.735 --> 39:17.465
However, in the meantime, he's looking
forward to spending a few days

39:17.605 --> 39:19.300
<i>with his brand-new baby boy,</i>

39:19.440 --> 39:21.704
<i>getting back onto the campaign trail,</i>

39:21.842 --> 39:25.403
<i>and eventually serving the great
state of California as its governor.</i>

39:25.546 --> 39:27.537
<i>Thank you.
Okay, we'll open for questions.</i>

39:37.958 --> 39:39.983
<i>- Hello.
Hey, Cooper. It's Uncle Saul.</i>

39:40.127 --> 39:42.687
<i>- Oh, hi, Uncle Saul.
- Can I speak to your mom?</i>

39:42.830 --> 39:45.663
Yeah. He wants to talk to you.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.734
Who's that? Hello.

39:48.102 --> 39:51.538
I'm at Tommy's. He needs our help.

40:12.193 --> 40:14.661
Justin, promise me something.

40:14.862 --> 40:16.659
Anything.

40:17.131 --> 40:20.191
No matter what happens,
we'll get through it.

40:20.868 --> 40:22.529
I promise.

40:23.070 --> 40:25.095
Rebecca, I love you.

40:27.908 --> 40:29.705
I'll get it.

40:47.628 --> 40:50.893
- Hi.
- Hi, uh, is Nora here?

40:51.031 --> 40:53.829
No. Sorry, um. Can I help you?

40:53.968 --> 40:56.596
I'm Ryan. Ryan Lafferty.

40:59.373 --> 41:02.809
Oh, my God. Hi, uh. Well, come on in.

41:04.245 --> 41:07.112
So are you Kitty or Sarah?

41:07.248 --> 41:09.808
Actually, I'm Rebecca.

41:11.619 --> 41:13.587
Hey.
- Hey.

41:14.822 --> 41:17.814
Justin, this is Ryan Lafferty.

41:23.998 --> 41:26.899
Hey.
- Hey.

41:27.034 --> 41:29.662
- Do you mind if I take him?
- No.

41:38.612 --> 41:40.341
Hi, angel.

41:45.119 --> 41:47.178
Oh, yeah.

41:49.423 --> 41:50.947
Hi.

41:52.226 --> 41:54.057
It's your mama.

41:57.264 --> 42:00.825
It's just gonna be
you and me now, okay?

42:01.802 --> 42:03.827
Yeah, it's okay.

42:05.239 --> 42:08.538
Everything's gonna be okay.
