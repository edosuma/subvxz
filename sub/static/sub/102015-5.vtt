WEBVTT

00:11.803 --> 00:13.013
Okay.

00:14.515 --> 00:18.560
Three, two, one. Good evening.
I'm Emily Dickinson.

00:26.026 --> 00:26.860
You recognized me?

00:26.944 --> 00:30.489
Yes. Yes, I am Emily Elizabeth Dickinson.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.997
I'm getting published, yes.
Yes, I know, it's quite a--

00:39.081 --> 00:40.457
Hey, guys.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.630
You look great.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.007
I do?

00:49.091 --> 00:51.385
You look like someone
who should be on the front page.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.354
This is it.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.650
You ready?

01:08.026 --> 01:10.404
Are you ready to see and be seen?

01:11.029 --> 01:12.155
I hope so.

01:13.031 --> 01:16.118
Well, hope isn't good enough.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.663
You need to know it.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.249
Look at yourself.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.794
Look at yourself and say,

01:27.629 --> 01:28.839
"I deserve this.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.092
I earned it.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.346
It's now my time to shine."

01:55.574 --> 01:56.575
What do you think?

01:58.285 --> 01:59.286
Very respectable.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.204
Exactly.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.914
I like your gold dress better.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.040
But not for tonight.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.584
Tonight, I need something that says,

02:06.668 --> 02:11.465
"I was too busy reading and thinking
profound intellectual thoughts

02:11.548 --> 02:13.634
to even consider getting dressed up."

02:13.717 --> 02:15.594
I think you're making that statement.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.557
But it needs something.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.102
Hand me those.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.731
Do you need spectacles?

02:27.814 --> 02:29.816
Not at all.
I actually have perfect vision.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.111
But don't they make me look smart?

02:34.154 --> 02:36.949
Tonight is going to be
an intellectual thrill ride.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.201
We have a very impressive speaker.

02:39.284 --> 02:42.746
And to top it all off, Sam Bowles
will be here tonight. With Emily.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.665
This will be their very first
public appearance

02:44.748 --> 02:46.375
since he agreed to publish her poem.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.586
You know, people are going to talk
about the fact

02:49.670 --> 02:53.257
that it was my salon where
Sam Bowles discovered Emily Dickinson.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.425
Where I helped him discover her.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.718
I'm a tastemaker, Hattie.

02:57.386 --> 02:58.512
And now I've put together

02:58.595 --> 03:01.473
what could be one of the greatest
literary partnerships in history.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.600
Are the housewives of Great Barrington
doing that?

03:03.684 --> 03:04.935
No, I don't think so.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.353
That's right.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.481
Now, I'm sure people are already here.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.777
Wait, are you sure
you don't wanna wear this?

03:13.861 --> 03:17.573
I mean, it's just so beautiful
and from New York.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.576
Hattie, I already told you.
It's not the right look for tonight.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.786
-And besides...
-Yeah?

03:22.870 --> 03:25.080
I can't be seen in the same dress twice.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.172
Hello, family.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.508
I am headed over to Sue and Austin's.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.012
Should I change?

03:40.095 --> 03:44.683
No, no. You look beautiful.
Ravishing, in fact.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.769
Who knows?
Maybe you'll catch some man's eye tonight.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.314
I'd given up every hope
of you ever getting married,

03:50.397 --> 03:53.525
but with Lavinia's recent engagement,
we're on a winning streak.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.652
Doesn't anyone else
wanna come to the party?

03:55.736 --> 03:56.820
I do, but--

03:56.904 --> 03:58.197
Absolutely not.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.741
Sue and Austin are living
a very decadent lifestyle,

04:00.824 --> 04:02.701
and I simply don't approve of it.

04:02.784 --> 04:06.455
It's not the Dickinson way.
And it wasn't the Norcross way either.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.332
No, we're not going to the party.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.709
We're doing the thing that Dickinsons do,

04:10.792 --> 04:14.963
which is to stay at home and
sit very quietly with our own thoughts.

04:15.506 --> 04:16.507
What she said.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.382
A quiet night in, baby.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.302
Novels and chill.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.806
Well, I'm gonna go.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.184
Have fun, dear.

04:28.727 --> 04:32.105
And please, take notes on how much money
they're spending on champagne.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.158
So, you're both ministers?

04:43.909 --> 04:46.537
I'm eager to see
who the lecturer is tonight.

04:46.620 --> 04:50.707
Daniel and I saw an organist at a salon
in Hardwick last week. Stunning.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.792
Wasn't it, dear?

04:51.875 --> 04:53.752
I don't know. It was slightly irreverent.

04:53.836 --> 04:55.504
I just love salon culture.

04:55.587 --> 05:00.259
Exchanging philosophical ideas.
Encountering new intellectual challenges.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.969
The life of the mind.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.887
I thought you got all that
from my sermons.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.974
Oh, no, yeah. I do. I totally do.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.726
Hello, everybody. It's me.
I am getting published.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.231
Like, in a book?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.066
Well, The Springfield Republican.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.026
Sam Bowles is publishing one of my poems.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.988
Emily, you're gonna be, like, famous.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.950
Okay, can I just say, I have always
been the biggest fan of this one.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.287
-Have you?
-Emily, we're best friends.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.205
I don't think we've ever spoken
one-on-one.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.585
Did you know Sam Bowles sleeps
with all the women he publishes?

05:36.503 --> 05:38.130
What are you talking about? He's married.

05:38.213 --> 05:41.592
Oh, I love her. She's so old-fashioned.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.761
No, he adores his wife.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.346
His wife who's never with him.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.975
He does seem to do
his fair share of gallivanting.

05:50.392 --> 05:54.938
Oh, yeah. All over New England,
on the hunt for female writers.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.273
Okay, that's not fair.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.983
If men can't be interested
in publishing women,

05:58.066 --> 05:59.902
then how are women ever
supposed to get published?

05:59.985 --> 06:03.614
Who says women should be published?
I think it's scandalous.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.450
You guys are wrong about Sam.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.620
He's just a great editor
who has an eye for talent.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.580
There's my genius.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.125
Emily Dickinson, front-page poet.

06:16.627 --> 06:19.505
-Have you told everyone the big news?
-Yes. Yes, I have.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.381
Oh, Sam, it's so exciting.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.134
Not as exciting as this dress.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.720
Wow. It's beautiful.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.057
Look, my guests of honor are here.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.184
The editor and his poet.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.436
That's the kind of rare literary match

06:34.853 --> 06:37.022
that only gets made
at a salon like this one, you know?

06:38.023 --> 06:40.317
Mr. Bowles,
I'm so pleased you could make it.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.820
And, Emily, you look gorgeous.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.532
I'm not sure I wore the right thing, Sue.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.659
Darling, you look perfect.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.955
You need to stand out.
You're New England's hottest new writer.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.998
When is the poem coming out?

06:55.082 --> 06:56.667
Yeah, can't wait to read it.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.586
Next week, I think. Maybe Wednesday?

06:59.670 --> 07:00.671
Maybe Friday.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.506
We have a few things lined up.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.174
Well, push them all back.

07:04.258 --> 07:07.094
Emily's voice needs to be heard.
Don't you agree?

07:07.970 --> 07:09.054
Absolutely.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.392
I am just so thrilled that
I could bring the two of you together.

07:13.809 --> 07:16.103
Something about this feels like...

07:17.229 --> 07:18.480
destiny.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.275
So, Emily...

07:23.151 --> 07:25.237
-are you ready?
-For what?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.155
For me to show you off.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.868
Well, I just hope
this salon is ready for me.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.744
Get it, girl.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.126
Everyone is here tonight.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.171
There's Ferdinand Andrews,
editor of the Boston Traveller.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.922
And there's Harriet Prescott Spofford.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.883
Harriet Prescott Spofford, the poet?

07:45.966 --> 07:48.719
Yes. I discovered her a few years ago.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.555
Now they call her
the Flaming Fire Lily of New England.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.725
I wonder what your nickname will be.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.059
I'd love to talk to her.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.770
Hey, look. It's Sanford Gifford.

07:59.271 --> 08:02.691
Come on, you gotta meet this guy.
He's a great painter, total asshole.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.904
All right. Let's do this.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.409
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.953
-We need to talk.
-Okay.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.456
So, listen.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.958
I know now that we're engaged,

08:20.042 --> 08:23.253
you think that I'm gonna become
this tame, obedient housewife

08:23.337 --> 08:25.964
who always stays inside
and never goes to parties

08:26.048 --> 08:28.759
and gets all of her satisfaction in life
from darning your socks.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.345
But you're wrong.

08:31.929 --> 08:34.932
I am not the boring Dickinson sister.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.143
People don't even realize this,
but I am a lot like Emily.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.395
I'm wild and creative.

08:42.105 --> 08:45.609
And the truth is, I am even more
outrageous than Lola Montez.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.154
Lola?

08:49.238 --> 08:54.159
So, if you think we're gonna have
a quiet night in, you're wrong.

08:54.576 --> 08:55.911
I need more than that.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.746
I need stimulation.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.749
Okay. It's just-- I'm trying to read.

09:00.832 --> 09:01.792
Why?

09:01.875 --> 09:04.419
Well, if I'm gonna marry a Dickinson,
I gotta get educated.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.296
So, that's what you picked to start?

09:06.713 --> 09:08.006
The Scarlet Letter?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.716
Yeah. Why not?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.135
Honestly, it's kind of trashy.

09:12.553 --> 09:16.598
Okay. Well, so, what is it about?

09:17.057 --> 09:22.104
Well, it's about this woman,
Hester Prynne,

09:22.187 --> 09:24.314
who lives in colonial Boston.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.733
And she believes
that her husband has drowned,

09:26.817 --> 09:31.280
so she has this affair with a minister.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.866
And she falls in love with him,
and she gets pregnant.

09:33.949 --> 09:36.910
But then her husband comes back,
and so she's publicly shamed

09:36.994 --> 09:40.914
and forced to wear a scarlet letter "A"
as a symbol of her adultery.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.418
Okay. So, yeah,
I guess that does sound pretty dull.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.962
-You know what, Ship?
-What?

09:47.045 --> 09:48.046
It isn't dull.

09:48.130 --> 09:52.384
It isn't safe or prim
or proper or well-behaved.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.971
Actually, it's ribald.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.473
Don't know what that means.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.058
Okay.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.479
Forget the intellectual salon.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.316
You know what we're gonna do tonight?

10:07.399 --> 10:08.400
What?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.028
We're gonna have a little English lesson.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.741
Sanford, you bastard.
Great to see you.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.826
And for once, you're not covered in paint.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.953
Listen, there's someone
I want you to meet.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.789
An astounding new poet, Emily Dickinson.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.125
Your new flavor of the month?

10:25.209 --> 10:27.628
She's gonna be around
a lot longer than a month.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.546
Her poems are magical.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.508
They're like these tiny little anthills

10:32.591 --> 10:34.676
that suddenly explode
with the force of a volcano.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.222
That's the nicest thing
anyone has ever said about me.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.016
Congratulations, Miss...

10:41.099 --> 10:42.351
Dickinson.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.977
You seem like just his type.

10:46.730 --> 10:47.731
And what do you do?

10:48.482 --> 10:51.527
He's an artist.
A brilliant artist.

10:51.610 --> 10:54.154
He just means my paintings
sell for a lot of money.

10:54.947 --> 10:56.448
And what exactly do you paint?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.825
Mostly just the Hudson River.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.620
Sanford is a major figure
in the new Hudson River school.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.622
He's doing totally new things
with the light.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.124
Yeah, that's what I tell them.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.919
"Oh, it's about the light."

11:09.002 --> 11:11.213
As soon as they hear,
"It's about the light,"

11:11.296 --> 11:13.048
that's when they cough up the big bucks.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.175
Well, every artist needs a patron.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.261
Is Mr. Bowles your patron?

11:17.928 --> 11:20.430
No. He's my...

11:22.057 --> 11:23.058
editor.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.686
I like the sound of that.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.939
Well, good. Because
I have a lot more poems to give you,

11:29.022 --> 11:30.399
and I hope you publish them all.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.609
I look forward to reading them.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.153
How nice.

11:35.237 --> 11:38.907
By the way, Bowles,
Miss Louisa Pratt sends her regards.

11:38.991 --> 11:39.992
Oh. Does she?

11:40.075 --> 11:42.578
She really enjoyed
the time you spent together

11:42.661 --> 11:44.413
on your recent trip to Washington.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.707
Well, I enjoyed it too.
We had a great time.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.333
Emily, wanna get a refill?

11:48.417 --> 11:52.087
Oh, yes, by all means.
I know how short your attention span is.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.047
Go ahead, go mingle.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.757
I actually need to go find Sue.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.759
-Emily, wait--
-Tell her I said hello.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.013
These rich people
just keep buying my paintings.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.477
What happened to the aprons
I gave you to wear?

12:07.561 --> 12:08.729
Got them dirty.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.440
I asked you to help out Hattie
with serving our guests.

12:11.523 --> 12:12.691
Sue.

12:13.442 --> 12:15.402
Girls, why don't you go into the parlor?

12:15.986 --> 12:17.362
Help yourself to some cheese.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.616
-That's for the guests.
-Sue.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.328
You can't talk to them like that.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.914
That's how I have to talk to them
if they misbehave.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.583
You know, I would think
that you would feel sorry for them.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.461
You were orphaned
and you had no one to take care of you.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.547
And I don't want
to be reminded of that, Austin.

12:36.215 --> 12:40.761
When I was in their situation,
I did the work I was told to do.

12:40.844 --> 12:44.223
I didn't antagonize the people
who were kind enough to let me in.

12:45.641 --> 12:47.059
You think this is kind?

12:48.060 --> 12:51.313
You know, not everyone grows up
as spoiled as the Dickinsons.

12:51.772 --> 12:55.275
Unlike those girls, I didn't even
have an inheritance to fall back on.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.486
Their inheritance
is paying for this house.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.782
They're not here to be our servants.

13:01.865 --> 13:05.035
It's thanks to their money
that we even have a roof over our heads.

13:05.577 --> 13:10.207
Well, if that's the case,
then you're the one taking advantage.

13:17.381 --> 13:18.382
Mr. Dickinson.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.176
-I beg your pardon.
-Henry.

13:21.885 --> 13:22.886
You need something?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.096
Yes, sir.

13:25.180 --> 13:30.143
Later tonight, if it's all right,
I'll need your help with the delivery.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.728
Yes.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.481
Yes, of course.

13:39.069 --> 13:42.656
"Do you not believe that you have sinned?"

13:42.739 --> 13:45.409
I believe that I have sinned
in your eyes.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.287
But who is to know
if God shares your views?

13:48.370 --> 13:49.955
"Silence, woman!"

13:51.540 --> 13:57.337
"Now, wear this letter upon your bo-dice."

13:58.589 --> 13:59.590
Bodice.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.633
You say it your way, I say it mine.

14:02.718 --> 14:04.052
Yes, minister.

14:04.136 --> 14:06.180
My bodice is all yours.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.807
Don't you think
you should be a little more chaste?

14:09.474 --> 14:11.393
-Just-- No?
-No breaking character.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.311
Right.

14:13.604 --> 14:14.605
Sorry.

14:16.732 --> 14:20.777
'Tis not a symbol of my shame,
but your own.

14:25.824 --> 14:28.702
You're different than how
I remembered you, Lavinia Dickinson.

14:29.703 --> 14:30.704
Hester.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.372
Hester.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.876
You're crazy. And I like it.

14:42.841 --> 14:43.842
Sue.

14:44.301 --> 14:45.969
Emily. What is it?

14:46.053 --> 14:49.723
I need to ask you about all these rumors.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.308
What rumors?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.810
People keep telling me
Sam Bowles cheats on his wife.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.396
Okay.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.774
-Well, that's not true.
-Are you sure?

14:59.441 --> 15:01.151
Because the minute they
heard he was publishing me,

15:01.235 --> 15:03.904
they just started to assume
that we were intimate.

15:05.197 --> 15:07.241
That's the most insulting thing
I've ever heard.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.452
He's publishing you
because you are a genius.

15:10.536 --> 15:12.746
-I know that's what you might think--
-Emily.

15:12.829 --> 15:13.830
It's what I know.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.709
Listen, I know Sam. And I know Mary.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.962
Mary and I grew up together, remember?

15:20.045 --> 15:21.046
Yeah.

15:22.005 --> 15:25.175
You once told me she was
the only friend you ever had before me.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.220
Yes, I loved Mary very much.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.806
Mary is special in a lot of ways.

15:31.515 --> 15:32.724
She reminds me of you.

15:33.392 --> 15:35.185
She's introspective.

15:36.228 --> 15:38.188
Mary doesn't like to leave the house.

15:38.272 --> 15:39.481
She's terribly shy.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.776
I guess she just doesn't
really like to be seen.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.444
I can understand that.

15:45.696 --> 15:49.157
I came here tonight to be seen, and so far
it's been a pretty unpleasant experience.

15:49.241 --> 15:50.617
Well, that just makes me angry.

15:51.159 --> 15:53.161
You deserve to be seen, Emily.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.873
You deserve to be published.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.585
And it's just not fair,
what happens to women.

15:59.668 --> 16:04.548
The minute we get a little bit of fame,
or show the slightest amount of ambition,

16:04.631 --> 16:07.426
we get slapped with the nastiest comments.

16:08.093 --> 16:10.345
We get these targets on our backs.

16:10.429 --> 16:13.765
Well, I say to hell with all of that.

16:13.849 --> 16:16.435
You go out there and you own this.

16:16.852 --> 16:18.145
You worked for this.

16:19.271 --> 16:22.065
And Sam Bowles believes in you
as a writer. And that's that.

16:23.317 --> 16:24.318
Thank you.

16:25.194 --> 16:26.028
Okay.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.531
Now, let's find our seats.
It's time for the lecture.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.165
There's my superstar.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.378
Hope I'm making a good impression.

16:43.462 --> 16:44.588
Are you kidding me?

16:44.671 --> 16:46.757
These people have no idea
what to do with you.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.219
But one day they'll all brag about
how they met Emily Dickinson at a party

16:50.302 --> 16:51.720
before she was anyone.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.850
Attention, everyone.

16:56.934 --> 16:58.685
Please find your seats.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.854
Our speaker is almost ready.

17:00.938 --> 17:04.358
-This is gonna be good.
-I just hope it's pious.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.582
Thank you.

17:29.550 --> 17:30.884
Is this conceptual?

17:51.029 --> 17:52.364
How's everybody doing tonight?

17:58.245 --> 18:03.500
Who here knows what freedom is?

18:04.543 --> 18:05.544
Meet me in the library.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.296
-You, sir?
-Obeying God.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.964
I'll see you there.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.048
Not exactly.

18:10.591 --> 18:13.051
Freedom is about being yourself.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.637
Even if you're just a young, hot widow.

18:17.472 --> 18:18.891
Closer but no.

18:19.892 --> 18:23.520
Freedom is throwing off your shackles

18:24.688 --> 18:28.984
and saying, "Hey, world. Here I am."

18:34.072 --> 18:35.073
And freedom...

18:39.244 --> 18:40.329
can be magic.

18:47.336 --> 18:50.088
-Thank you.
-Now, who is ready to hear my story?

18:50.589 --> 18:54.718
I was born on a plantation
in Louisa County, Virginia.

18:55.427 --> 18:56.595
I entered the world a slave.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.055
You didn't like the lecture?

18:58.138 --> 19:00.724
Oh, no. I've seen it before.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.851
Three times, actually.

19:02.935 --> 19:05.187
Henry "Box" Brown really makes the rounds.

19:06.355 --> 19:08.815
Well, I was pretty riveted. So...

19:08.899 --> 19:10.776
Oh, yes. Look, here we are.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.819
-What?
-Dickens.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.571
Charles Dickens?

19:14.655 --> 19:17.324
And Diderot.

19:18.784 --> 19:22.412
Look, this is where you will go.

19:23.121 --> 19:23.956
Right here.

19:25.249 --> 19:26.375
Emily Dickinson.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.629
-Me?
-Your books.

19:30.712 --> 19:34.550
Between the modern master
and the Enlightenment.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.094
How does that sound?

19:38.053 --> 19:40.222
I don't know.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.890
Oh, no. You're right.

19:42.474 --> 19:43.809
There's not enough room.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.561
You're gonna need your own shelf.

19:47.479 --> 19:48.480
Imagine that.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.946
I can imagine a lot of things, but...

19:57.823 --> 20:03.871
something about all this
feels almost forbidden.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.959
Forbidden fruit has an interesting flavor,
doesn't it?

20:16.091 --> 20:17.092
Damn.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.511
Isn't she a beauty?

20:19.595 --> 20:21.388
A printing press.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.225
It's a powerful machine.

20:25.893 --> 20:27.102
Yes.

20:27.978 --> 20:30.272
Imagine what you can do with this thing.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.107
I'm hoping we can start a revolution.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.652
Oh, hey.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.409
I don't know if this is safe enough.

20:43.202 --> 20:44.411
It's all right, Henry.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.788
No one comes in this barn
without my permission.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.418
That lecture was bullshit!

20:51.502 --> 20:52.878
Hey, Hattie.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.714
"Oh, Box, Box.
What was it like in the box?"

20:55.797 --> 20:58.342
Don't those fools know
he wasn't even planning to escape?

20:58.425 --> 21:01.261
-Hattie.
-He was drunk and he fell asleep.

21:01.345 --> 21:03.889
And it was ten years ago.

21:03.972 --> 21:06.808
Henry, you cannot put this guy's writing
in our newspaper.

21:06.892 --> 21:09.895
You're just mad because I put him
on the front page instead of you.

21:09.978 --> 21:10.979
-No.
-Yeah.

21:11.063 --> 21:12.898
No. I'm serious.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.983
He's, like,
actively bad for the community.

21:15.067 --> 21:17.110
People check the boxes now.

21:17.194 --> 21:20.447
I had a cousin
who tried to escape in a box of sugar.

21:20.531 --> 21:25.911
Like, buried himself under the sugar,
and they still caught him.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.746
Now he's stuck in Mississippi.

21:28.247 --> 21:29.748
Plus, he's hypoglycemic.

21:31.542 --> 21:32.835
Hey, Hattie.

21:35.963 --> 21:37.256
Maybe this will cheer you up.

21:42.511 --> 21:43.720
Oh, wow.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.641
Look at that thing.

21:47.724 --> 21:48.934
Beautiful, isn't it?

21:50.519 --> 21:52.187
Thank you, Mr. Dickinson.

21:52.271 --> 21:53.480
You're an angel.

21:53.564 --> 21:54.565
Austin.

21:54.648 --> 21:58.110
And I'm just trying
to make a difference to somebody.

22:01.071 --> 22:05.242
Well, I'm a freelance writer,
and I just ran out of words.

22:11.415 --> 22:12.666
Mr. Bowles.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.503
You missed the lecture.

22:16.587 --> 22:18.172
I'm sorry, Suzie.

22:18.255 --> 22:19.464
I've seen it before.

22:21.592 --> 22:23.468
You're too sophisticated for us.

22:23.552 --> 22:24.595
For the Evergreens?

22:24.678 --> 22:27.306
The pinnacle of New England literary life?

22:27.389 --> 22:28.390
Of course not.

22:29.725 --> 22:32.519
So, you'll still do a write-up
of the salon in your paper?

22:32.603 --> 22:33.729
Yes, of course.

22:34.188 --> 22:37.107
My readers are fiending
for more details of your witty circle.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.361
Suzie, this is the place to be.

22:41.904 --> 22:44.114
The best wine, the most beautiful people.

22:44.489 --> 22:46.825
And the greatest poet in Massachusetts.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.578
Great lecture, Sue.

22:49.661 --> 22:52.206
The whole box thing
really just blew me away.

22:53.207 --> 22:55.334
We're gonna take off.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.669
Yes, I didn't realize
quite how late it was getting.

22:57.753 --> 22:58.795
Thank you for coming.

22:58.879 --> 23:02.758
We're riding right past the inn,
if you need a lift.

23:02.841 --> 23:06.136
Thank you, but there's no room at the inn.
I'm gonna crash here tonight.

23:06.553 --> 23:07.554
Here?

23:08.180 --> 23:10.140
Sam is staying in the spare room.

23:10.224 --> 23:12.601
Unfortunately, it's the smaller one.

23:13.060 --> 23:15.062
Clara and Anna took the big one.

23:15.145 --> 23:18.232
Come on.
I can sleep in a closet.

23:18.774 --> 23:21.109
Really, you and Austin,
you're far too hospitable.

23:21.193 --> 23:22.986
Please.
It's the least we can do to thank you

23:23.070 --> 23:26.073
for giving my salon the Sam Bowles touch.

23:26.782 --> 23:29.326
Now I better go make sure
those two charming young ladies

23:29.409 --> 23:31.078
haven't put any snakes in your bed.

23:31.537 --> 23:32.871
Duties of a housewife.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.464
Speaking of wives, I...

23:43.590 --> 23:45.342
I better go and telegram Mary.

23:45.926 --> 23:48.428
She gets so worried
when I'm away for a few nights.

23:48.929 --> 23:49.930
I'm sure.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.724
I would really love to meet Mary.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.393
You would?

23:57.062 --> 23:58.355
She would love you.

23:58.981 --> 24:00.649
-You really think so?
-Of course.

24:01.525 --> 24:05.863
You two are both such... unusual women.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.744
Do me a favor.

24:13.412 --> 24:14.413
What?

24:15.539 --> 24:16.540
Write something.

24:17.291 --> 24:18.292
Tonight.

24:19.376 --> 24:20.377
I'll try.

24:22.087 --> 24:25.090
And know that I'll be right here...

24:26.842 --> 24:28.051
unable to sleep,

24:30.220 --> 24:34.266
because I am so close
to your incredible talent.

24:36.602 --> 24:37.603
Okay?

24:40.898 --> 24:42.107
Good night, poet.

24:43.734 --> 24:44.735
Good night.

25:16.058 --> 25:17.267
Dear Mary,

25:17.976 --> 25:22.523
Since I have no sweet flower to send you
I enclose my heart.
