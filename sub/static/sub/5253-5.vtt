00:00.001 --> 00:01.601
Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:01.617 --> 00:04.450
<i>- You accepted a real
ring? - I couldn't say no.</i>

00:04.475 --> 00:05.674
He was gonna break up with you.

00:05.676 --> 00:07.428
He said he was still into Jenna.

00:07.453 --> 00:09.911
You can't hurt me because you are Jake,

00:09.913 --> 00:12.448
and I'm Matty [bleep] McKibben.

00:12.450 --> 00:15.154
That over there, that is weird.

00:15.179 --> 00:17.593
(Jenna) Ever since Spring
Break, senior year had been

00:17.607 --> 00:19.440
about taking things a
little less seriously.

00:19.442 --> 00:22.490
Instead of worrying about GPAs
and college acceptance letters,

00:22.515 --> 00:23.703
we'd be filling our calendars

00:23.704 --> 00:25.328
- with parties and pranks.
- _

00:25.353 --> 00:27.584
But for some of us, our
calendar was a reminder

00:27.609 --> 00:29.998
of all the things we
weren't following through on.

00:30.023 --> 00:32.057
[clears throat] Tamara, you have been

00:32.082 --> 00:34.132
not breaking up with
Adam for three weeks now.

00:34.141 --> 00:36.341
Valid point, Judge
Moody, but in my defense,

00:36.343 --> 00:39.078
I have a legit reason for
every one of those days.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.080
I had a horrendo zit on that day.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.182
Adam worked out in front of me on that day.

00:43.184 --> 00:45.117
Adam worked out in front of me on that day.

00:45.119 --> 00:47.687
You know, I totally
thought I was anti-sweat.

00:47.689 --> 00:49.320
Turns out I'm totally pro-persp.

00:49.322 --> 00:51.590
Tamara, you can't keep up
this fake-bride act forever,

00:51.592 --> 00:54.459
and I sure as hell can't keep
up this fake-maid-of-honor act.

00:54.461 --> 00:57.095
I don't understand why
you can't just end it.

00:57.097 --> 00:58.468
Unless...

00:59.820 --> 01:01.566
Are you in love with him?

01:01.568 --> 01:02.834
[scoffs] As if.

01:02.836 --> 01:04.069
He's a great guy, Jenna,

01:04.095 --> 01:07.092
but I am a 17-year-old
girl who has a whole future

01:07.117 --> 01:09.851
of having sex with guys who
just worked out ahead of her.

01:09.853 --> 01:12.687
I'm going to end the engagement, I swear.

01:12.689 --> 01:14.491
[cell phone chimes]

01:15.425 --> 01:17.025
"Count me in. Can I bring a plus-one?"

01:17.027 --> 01:18.226
What does that mean?

01:18.228 --> 01:19.304
[cell phone chimes]

01:19.329 --> 01:21.072
"See you tomorrow night."
What are they talking about?

01:21.097 --> 01:22.863
Oh, that. That's just the engagement party

01:22.865 --> 01:24.265
that you're hosting tomorrow night.

01:24.267 --> 01:26.600
Aw, you're the best maid of honor ever.

01:26.602 --> 01:28.602
[cell phone chimes]

01:28.604 --> 01:30.038
Tamara!

Synced and corrected by Chitorafa
www.addic7ed.com

01:34.210 --> 01:36.069
Tamara, get back here.

01:36.446 --> 01:39.350
Take a chill pill, Solange Knowles.

01:40.115 --> 01:41.248
What is all this crap?

01:41.250 --> 01:43.417
Wedding cake designs,
table assignment chart,

01:43.419 --> 01:44.980
fabric swatches?

01:45.287 --> 01:46.720
You had save-the-dates printed?

01:46.722 --> 01:49.067
Get your hands off my STDs.

01:49.525 --> 01:50.991
Oh, suddenly, it all makes sense.

01:50.993 --> 01:52.857
- What does?
- You are in love.

01:52.882 --> 01:53.810
Already been over this.

01:53.835 --> 01:55.005
With wedding planning.

01:55.030 --> 01:56.263
Oh, please.

01:56.265 --> 01:57.631
Not just in love, obsessed,

01:57.633 --> 01:59.499
addicted to place settings
and designer invites.

01:59.501 --> 02:00.800
This one smells like lavender.

02:00.802 --> 02:02.269
T, you have to stop this. It's not right.

02:02.271 --> 02:03.636
It's embarrassing.

02:03.638 --> 02:05.439
Oh, cinnamon. Stop it.

02:05.441 --> 02:07.274
They're like Kettle chips.
Once you start, you can't stop.

02:07.276 --> 02:09.246
You have to be honest with Adam.

02:09.270 --> 02:10.692
[sighs] You're right.

02:10.717 --> 02:12.912
It's just this engagement
party was Adam's idea,

02:12.914 --> 02:15.748
and he's so excited to
meet all of my friends.

02:15.750 --> 02:19.035
T, he thinks he's marrying you. Call him.

02:19.060 --> 02:21.287
He's already in the car.
What if he drives off a cliff?

02:21.289 --> 02:22.489
Fine, then when he gets here.

02:22.491 --> 02:23.990
Okay. "Hi, Adam.

02:23.992 --> 02:25.792
"Thanks for driving two
hours to our engagement party.

02:25.794 --> 02:27.093
"These are my friends.

02:27.095 --> 02:28.795
"So I don't love you, but, please,

02:28.797 --> 02:30.396
help yourself to a chicken croquette."

02:30.398 --> 02:31.598
(Jenna) Tamara had a point,

02:31.600 --> 02:33.833
an idiotic one, but still, a point.

02:33.835 --> 02:35.635
She had let things go too far with Adam,

02:35.637 --> 02:37.570
and getting out of it at this exact moment

02:37.572 --> 02:39.238
was not going to be easy.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.874
I'll break up with him in the morning.

02:40.876 --> 02:42.742
It'll be better over brunch... a brunch-up.

02:42.744 --> 02:45.711
I promise. Just, please, as my BFF,

02:45.713 --> 02:47.546
help me get through this party.

02:47.548 --> 02:49.715
Adam is so looking forward to it,

02:49.717 --> 02:53.319
and he's probably sitting
in traffic on the 405.

02:53.321 --> 02:54.620
Fine.

02:55.722 --> 02:57.456
This means so much to me, Jenna.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.791
I hated when she pulled the BFF card,

02:59.793 --> 03:02.261
but this time, there
were going to be limits.

03:02.263 --> 03:03.695
Fine, but it ends tomorrow.

03:03.697 --> 03:05.530
No more living in your
deranged wedding fantasy land.

03:05.532 --> 03:07.432
Tomorrow is truth and reality land.

03:07.434 --> 03:09.234
So where are we having this thing?

03:09.236 --> 03:10.824
- Your house.
- What?

03:10.849 --> 03:12.395
Chillax. Your mom said she's cool with it.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.219
She and your dad are
heading down to San Diego

03:14.221 --> 03:16.021
for the weekend for a pre-baby bone-a-thon

03:16.000 --> 03:17.900
now that your mom's nausea has died down.

03:17.925 --> 03:19.052
Lacey confides in me.

03:19.077 --> 03:20.803
Plus, she's so excited for my engagement,

03:20.828 --> 03:22.795
which is great, because
there's no way in hell

03:22.797 --> 03:24.029
I can tell my mom.

03:24.031 --> 03:26.669
Also, hello. You're maid of honor.

03:27.278 --> 03:28.771
_

03:30.403 --> 03:32.203
What's it take to be number one?

03:32.205 --> 03:33.871
Some are just born with it,

03:33.873 --> 03:36.107
but there's a whole bunch of
other junk that helps too...

03:36.109 --> 03:37.742
dedication, protein bars...

03:37.744 --> 03:39.244
You nervous, babe?

03:39.246 --> 03:42.280
No, not at all, just bored.

03:42.282 --> 03:44.449
Jake, you're sweating
through a suit jacket.

03:44.451 --> 03:46.418
Okay, yeah. I'm a little nervous.

03:46.420 --> 03:48.553
This scholarship would be huge for me.

03:48.555 --> 03:52.757
Ten grand... it could decide
what school I get to go to.

03:52.759 --> 03:54.358
You deserve this scholarship...

03:54.360 --> 03:56.427
your grades, the extra
work you've been putting in.

03:56.429 --> 03:58.896
You've been killing it on the soccer field.

03:58.898 --> 04:00.364
You got this.

04:00.366 --> 04:01.450
You think so?

04:01.475 --> 04:03.411
Yeah, just fix your tie

04:03.436 --> 04:05.603
so you don't embarrass me
when you give your speech.

04:05.605 --> 04:08.439
(Pete) Also, I want to say big ups
to Jesus and Quest Protein Bars.

04:08.441 --> 04:11.909
This award is for you guys. Whoo!

04:11.911 --> 04:15.546
[cheers and applause]

04:15.548 --> 04:17.547
Congrats, Peter.

04:17.548 --> 04:21.851
Now, for the Ryan O'Connell
Scholar Athletic Award.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.655
Matty McKibben.

04:25.657 --> 04:28.592
[applause]

04:32.030 --> 04:33.563
Hey. Uh, wow.

04:33.565 --> 04:37.734
This... I mean, this
is really... It's cool.

04:37.736 --> 04:41.138
So, yeah.

04:41.140 --> 04:45.308
- Thanks.
- [applause]

04:45.310 --> 04:48.677
Now, for the Chester A. Arthur Award

04:48.679 --> 04:50.779
for Aerobic Kickboxing...

04:50.781 --> 04:52.548
[keys clacking]

04:52.550 --> 04:53.849
Why are you so dressed up?

04:53.851 --> 04:55.184
It's an engagement party.

04:55.186 --> 04:56.619
I'm being respectful.

04:56.621 --> 04:58.187
Aw, how sweet.

04:58.189 --> 05:00.189
The two losers throwing the
party will be so surprised

05:00.191 --> 05:01.891
when someone shows them respect.

05:01.893 --> 05:04.327
Maybe I'll wear deodorant.

05:04.329 --> 05:06.329
How's the housing application coming?

05:06.331 --> 05:07.997
- "Smoker"? You don't smoke.
- Yeah.

05:07.999 --> 05:09.224
I don't snore either,

05:09.249 --> 05:10.866
but if I don't want to
end up sharing a room

05:10.868 --> 05:12.535
with some sea slug who smells like butt

05:12.537 --> 05:15.303
and hides weird cheeses
under her bed, I have to lie.

05:15.305 --> 05:17.006
It's the surest way to a single.

05:17.008 --> 05:18.774
My aunt has this thing called night terrors

05:18.776 --> 05:20.375
where she screams in her sleep.

05:20.377 --> 05:22.411
My Uncle Bralio has to sleep
in the pantry most nights.

05:22.413 --> 05:25.714
I am totally using that, along with IBS.

05:25.716 --> 05:26.544
What's that?

05:26.569 --> 05:28.895
Irritable bow... Let's not talk about it.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.453
I might want to have sex again later.

05:32.989 --> 05:34.589
(Jenna) All addicts need an enabler,

05:34.591 --> 05:37.592
and my BFF wedding
planner was no exception.

05:37.594 --> 05:40.095
All I had to do was kick
back with a few friends

05:40.097 --> 05:42.753
and get through one more night of lies.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.335
[wacky lounge music]

05:47.337 --> 05:49.646
Piece of cake.

05:54.603 --> 05:57.072
This is what you brought
to my engagement party...

05:57.074 --> 05:59.842
a pizza that you ate two slices out of?

05:59.844 --> 06:02.311
I didn't realize it was
gonna be so elaborate.

06:02.313 --> 06:03.313
I thought it was just gonna be

06:03.338 --> 06:04.947
a bunch of high-school kids getting drunk.

06:04.949 --> 06:07.182
But it's the last night of your fantasy,

06:07.184 --> 06:08.783
so I'm glad you went all out.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.885
So why are these butterflies in jars?

06:10.887 --> 06:13.287
Those are party favors.
There's two in each jar.

06:13.289 --> 06:15.789
One represents Adam, and one represents me.

06:15.791 --> 06:16.824
[doorbell rings]

06:16.826 --> 06:19.260
Ooh, that must be Adam and Brian.

06:19.262 --> 06:20.794
I mean Adam.

06:20.796 --> 06:22.024
[laughing] Oh, my God.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.731
- Brian's coming?
- T?

06:23.733 --> 06:25.566
Turns out he's the best man, Jenna.

06:25.568 --> 06:27.268
This is so uncomfortable for me.

06:27.270 --> 06:28.736
Okay. Take it down a notch.

06:28.738 --> 06:31.305
So you let Brian station
his soldier in your camp,

06:31.307 --> 06:32.639
and then you both shipped off.

06:32.641 --> 06:33.962
The feeling was mutual.

06:33.987 --> 06:35.430
You said it yourself, so what's the ish?

06:35.455 --> 06:37.188
The ish is I don't know
if the feeling was mutual.

06:37.204 --> 06:38.870
He's called me, like, four times since,

06:38.872 --> 06:40.672
and I sort of never called back.

06:40.674 --> 06:42.307
[doorbell rings]

06:42.309 --> 06:44.109
You've put me in a really bad position, T.

06:44.111 --> 06:45.577
Well, don't be all mad at me.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.412
You would have known he was coming

06:47.414 --> 06:49.281
if you would've checked the
invite that you sent out.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.789
Also, is that what you're wearing?

06:52.619 --> 06:53.885
Welcome. Come in.

06:53.887 --> 06:55.253
Deviled egg?

06:55.255 --> 06:56.988
I hope it's okay that I brought a friend.

06:56.990 --> 06:59.624
Since Matty ruined his life
by being a drunken knob,

06:59.626 --> 07:01.525
no one would come with
him, and knowing this party

07:01.527 --> 07:04.062
guaran-[bleep]-teed to be epically sad,

07:04.064 --> 07:05.730
there was no way I was missing it.

07:05.732 --> 07:07.231
So happy to be here.

07:07.233 --> 07:09.033
Oh, and I brought a plus-one.

07:09.035 --> 07:10.635
Deal.

07:12.237 --> 07:13.671
Thank you for having us.

07:13.673 --> 07:15.473
- You'll make a beautiful bride.
- Okay.

07:15.475 --> 07:17.975
Everyone help yourself to a
glass of wine on the way in.

07:17.977 --> 07:19.276
I'll take a beer if you have it.

07:19.278 --> 07:21.112
Uh, this isn't a kegger, McKibben.

07:24.782 --> 07:26.413
Oh, what up?

07:26.438 --> 07:29.220
Are we about to get Cr...

07:30.888 --> 07:32.256
Crazy?

07:32.258 --> 07:34.492
I knew tonight was gonna be good.

07:34.494 --> 07:37.161
Welcome. Thanks for helping
us begin our lives together.

07:37.163 --> 07:38.562
Help yourself to a glass of wine.

07:38.564 --> 07:39.962
I'll grab a beer if you have it.

07:39.964 --> 07:41.231
We're having wine.

07:41.233 --> 07:43.126
Everybody's having wine!

07:44.066 --> 07:47.036
(Jenna) The secret to being a
great host to Tamara's party tonight

07:47.038 --> 07:48.904
was that everything was a secret.

07:48.906 --> 07:53.042
The first secret was that Tamara
was actually hosting the party.

07:53.044 --> 07:54.544
The second was that the wedding

07:54.546 --> 07:56.746
we were honoring with
deviled eggs and butterflies

07:56.748 --> 07:58.148
was never going to happen.

07:58.150 --> 07:59.749
And since I'm a really bad liar,

07:59.751 --> 08:01.416
I knew the only way I had a prayer

08:01.418 --> 08:04.820
of keeping that secret was
to avoid Adam at all costs.

08:04.822 --> 08:06.088
Hey, Jenna.

08:06.090 --> 08:07.623
How's my BGBFF?

08:07.625 --> 08:09.659
Best Girl's Best Friend Forever?

08:09.661 --> 08:11.326
You know, Tamara has
that whole language thing

08:11.328 --> 08:12.995
I'm trying to keep up with.

08:12.997 --> 08:15.230
Yeah. Known her my whole
life and still only know half.

08:15.232 --> 08:17.399
I'll be honest... I wake up every morning

08:17.401 --> 08:19.301
looking forward to learning
something new from her.

08:19.303 --> 08:21.055
You might want to sleep in tomorrow.

08:21.080 --> 08:21.579
Huh?

08:21.604 --> 08:23.950
It's just my weird little sense of humor.

08:23.975 --> 08:25.240
[chuckles] You're funny.

08:25.242 --> 08:26.475
I look forward to a lot more laughs.

08:26.477 --> 08:28.076
Yeah. We're gonna need them.

08:28.078 --> 08:30.879
Quick favor... I don't
mean to plan too far ahead.

08:30.881 --> 08:32.687
That is a good plan.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.360
It was torture, like that exercise

08:34.385 --> 08:36.184
where someone tells you not
to think about an elephant,

08:36.187 --> 08:38.187
and then all you can
think about is elephants.

08:38.188 --> 08:39.921
I'm making a slideshow for the wedding,

08:39.923 --> 08:41.857
and I need some of T's baby pics.

08:41.859 --> 08:44.345
- Can I get her mom's number?
- Gabby, my girl.

08:44.735 --> 08:46.172
I brought cheese balls.

08:46.197 --> 08:48.868
- I don't know why.
- Are you okay?

08:48.893 --> 08:50.008
You seem a little...

08:50.033 --> 08:52.044
Drunk? Just say it, Jenna.

08:52.069 --> 08:54.548
- You can be honest.
- I really can't.

08:54.573 --> 08:55.937
It's a slippery slope for me tonight.

08:55.939 --> 08:59.074
The idea of spending a
whole night with my ex

08:59.076 --> 09:01.710
who I cheated on with my current boyfriend

09:01.712 --> 09:03.578
who once dated both of the girls

09:03.580 --> 09:04.946
who are throwing the party...

09:04.948 --> 09:06.682
Yeah, I don't drink often,

09:06.684 --> 09:10.928
but tonight I did a little pre-gaming.

09:11.789 --> 09:13.755
Wow. Look at you.

09:13.757 --> 09:16.224
Jenna, come here. Come... come here.

09:16.226 --> 09:19.828
I need to tell you something
about you and Matty.

09:19.830 --> 09:22.029
- What?
- Hey, Jenna.

09:26.467 --> 09:28.502
Hey, big guy.

09:28.504 --> 09:30.705
"Big guy." My dad calls me "big guy."

09:30.707 --> 09:32.406
Well, I guess now you
and him both call me that,

09:32.408 --> 09:33.874
which isn't weird or anything.

09:33.876 --> 09:36.243
- So, uh, how are things?
- Things are good.

09:36.245 --> 09:38.378
It's a nice party you got going on here.

09:38.380 --> 09:39.646
Pretty happy for those two, huh?

09:39.648 --> 09:41.381
I mean, it seemed kind of fast at first,

09:41.383 --> 09:44.418
but I'd bet anything they're in
it for the long haul, you know?

09:44.420 --> 09:46.141
Yeah. They're in for it.

09:46.788 --> 09:48.955
So I, um, called you a couple times.

09:48.957 --> 09:50.424
Oh, listen, I'm sorry.

09:50.426 --> 09:51.625
I just wanted to get your thoughts

09:51.627 --> 09:53.093
- on an engagement present.
- Oh.

09:53.095 --> 09:54.695
My buddy's got a resort up north,

09:54.697 --> 09:56.463
and he said he could
get us a deal on a suite.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.031
It'd only be, like, 400 bucks.

09:58.033 --> 10:00.734
I just wanted to see if
you'd go in on it with me.

10:00.736 --> 10:04.003
400 bucks for the lovebirds.

10:04.005 --> 10:07.073
You know what? Actually, I think
I'm just gonna do my own thing,

10:07.075 --> 10:08.508
if that's okay.

10:08.510 --> 10:10.938
Jenna, the fondue is chunky.

10:10.963 --> 10:15.126
Uh, got to go. I'm on
fondue duty, fond-duty.

10:15.150 --> 10:17.784
[laughs] Jenna, you are funny as [bleep].

10:18.119 --> 10:20.353
Jenna, chunky fondue.

10:31.567 --> 10:34.400
Awesome. Let's get the [bleep] out of here.

10:34.402 --> 10:37.169
No. I mean, Matty and I acting like idiots.

10:37.171 --> 10:39.104
I'm going to congratulate
him on his scholarship,

10:39.106 --> 10:40.940
try to end this stupid fight.

10:40.942 --> 10:43.442
Okay. I'll just wait
here with all your pals

10:43.444 --> 10:46.111
and all the women you slept with.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.111
Hey.

10:48.008 --> 10:50.195
Just want to say congrats.

10:50.985 --> 10:53.051
Oh, thanks.

10:53.430 --> 10:55.736
It's only ten grand. It's no big deal.

10:55.761 --> 10:57.195
"No big deal"? Yeah.

10:57.220 --> 10:58.996
I guess ten grand is no big deal

10:58.997 --> 11:01.289
when you're Matty [bleep] McKibben.

11:05.435 --> 11:06.836
- [sighs]
- Hey, everybody.

11:06.838 --> 11:08.971
It looks like someone put a wish

11:08.973 --> 11:11.546
in the Tamara and Adam wish bowl.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.775
Um, what the [bleep] is that?

11:13.777 --> 11:16.428
Shh. Jesus, Sadie.

11:17.181 --> 11:19.781
It's when someone writes
a wish for our future

11:19.783 --> 11:20.860
and puts it in the bowl.

11:20.885 --> 11:22.602
Take it out and read it, honey.

11:23.686 --> 11:25.432
[clears throat]

11:26.532 --> 11:30.458
Ooh. That's spit-up food, I'm pretty sure.

11:30.460 --> 11:32.660
Okay, you classless asses.

11:32.662 --> 11:34.562
Who spit in the napkin?

11:34.564 --> 11:36.231
I got a wish for us, T.

11:36.233 --> 11:38.900
My wish would be...

11:38.902 --> 11:42.036
a future wrapped in your arms.

11:50.883 --> 11:53.947
(Tamara) Jenna, where are you?
The apps need to circulate.

11:53.949 --> 11:55.282
Jenna!

11:55.284 --> 11:57.317
(Jenna) The only thing
I cared about circulating

11:57.319 --> 11:59.019
was enough alcohol through my system

11:59.021 --> 12:01.021
to deal with the guilt
of lying all evening.

12:01.023 --> 12:02.890
Boo, bitch! [giggles]

12:02.892 --> 12:05.359
You have to get down on
this three-bean salad.

12:05.361 --> 12:07.828
It is my jam.

12:07.830 --> 12:10.063
Gabby, so, um, I'm just curious.

12:10.065 --> 12:12.966
That thing you were talking
about earlier, about Matty?

12:12.968 --> 12:15.835
Oh. You want to know the secret?

12:15.837 --> 12:17.905
I don't know. Do I?

12:17.907 --> 12:21.530
He lo... lo... lo... loves you.

12:21.555 --> 12:22.575
Ow.

12:22.577 --> 12:23.843
What are you saying?

12:23.845 --> 12:25.315
I don't believe you.

12:25.614 --> 12:26.582
It's true.

12:27.516 --> 12:29.416
What's true? Just... just spill it.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.385
[vomits]

12:31.387 --> 12:32.886
(Jenna) And she spilled.

12:32.888 --> 12:33.987
[coughing]

12:34.798 --> 12:37.782
(Jenna) I had spent the entire
party trying to keep secrets,

12:37.790 --> 12:39.790
but now I was on a mission to hear one.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.792
Gabby clearly knew something about Matty,

12:41.794 --> 12:43.610
and if I couldn't get a
straight answer from her,

12:43.635 --> 12:45.930
I was going straight to the source.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.065

12:48.067 --> 12:51.035

12:54.508 --> 12:56.126
Need some company?

12:57.282 --> 12:59.639
I really messed things up with us.

13:00.285 --> 13:02.448
We were really good together.

13:03.389 --> 13:04.621
What are you saying?

13:04.623 --> 13:09.726
I guess I'm saying that
I miss the way we were.

13:09.728 --> 13:11.128
I think... I don't know.

13:11.130 --> 13:12.629
I think I kind of love...

13:12.631 --> 13:14.431
- You do?
- Him.

13:14.433 --> 13:16.699
What? Who?

13:16.701 --> 13:18.049
Jake.

13:18.404 --> 13:22.407
Not, like, romantically,
just like a brother.

13:22.432 --> 13:23.806
Yeah. No. Completely.

13:23.808 --> 13:26.643
I just, um... You should tell him.

13:26.645 --> 13:28.678
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.381
People should say how they
feel when they feel it.

13:31.383 --> 13:33.383
- They need to communicate.
- Damn right.

13:33.385 --> 13:35.085
And don't tell people I said I loved Jake,

13:35.087 --> 13:36.686

it's time for your speech.

13:46.364 --> 13:49.131
What speech? I don't have a speech.

13:49.376 --> 13:51.534
So the happy couple...

13:51.536 --> 13:55.504
my best friend, Tamara Kaplan and Adam...

13:55.506 --> 13:56.773
Walker.

13:56.775 --> 13:58.091
Walker, right.

13:58.279 --> 14:01.608
So these guys, huh? Yeah,
just really going for it.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.412
Just going right in. Wow.

14:03.414 --> 14:06.315
You know, some people
might call them crazy,

14:06.317 --> 14:09.318
or, you know, some people might even say,

14:09.320 --> 14:11.120
I don't know, stupid,

14:11.122 --> 14:15.524
but they're teenagers, you know, 17 and 19.

14:15.526 --> 14:16.658
I mean, what?

14:16.660 --> 14:21.069
And these people might
have a point or not at all

14:21.094 --> 14:23.932
because these two are
gonna be married forever,

14:23.934 --> 14:27.736
and no doubt about it... teenagers.

14:27.738 --> 14:29.243
It's crazy.

14:30.541 --> 14:32.036
But is it?

14:32.543 --> 14:34.055
Or is it possible

14:34.080 --> 14:36.945
that you can know who you're
meant to be with from the start,

14:36.947 --> 14:39.347
and maybe we just let a bunch of things

14:39.349 --> 14:43.018
like not saying how we
really feel get in the way,

14:43.020 --> 14:45.453
and, you know, maybe it
is better to wait and see

14:45.455 --> 14:48.790
if fate brings us back around
in this crazy merry-go-round

14:48.792 --> 14:50.325
that seems to spin endlessly,

14:50.327 --> 14:52.160
making us want to barf in the process.

14:52.162 --> 14:55.396
And, you know, does fate really exist?

14:55.398 --> 14:57.065
And if so,

14:57.067 --> 14:59.693
why even bother, you know?

15:00.537 --> 15:04.873
She is losing what's left
of her tiny, pathetic mind.

15:06.808 --> 15:08.443
To the beautiful couple.

15:08.445 --> 15:11.712
I hope I'm lucky enough one
day to find what you have.

15:11.714 --> 15:12.847

15:27.631 --> 15:29.396
Why are you being so precious?

15:29.398 --> 15:30.964
She's going to college next year,

15:30.966 --> 15:32.799
and you know that the
minute she gets there,

15:32.801 --> 15:34.368
she's gonna be in a frat-bro sandwich

15:34.370 --> 15:36.270
before she can even crack a book.

15:36.272 --> 15:39.906
Marriage is for simple-minded asshats.

15:59.427 --> 16:00.593
I messed everything up.

16:00.595 --> 16:02.628
It's okay. Don't. I kind of...

- Yeah, totally.

16:20.581 --> 16:22.514

16:29.189 --> 16:32.257
[man speaking indistinctly on television]

16:38.197 --> 16:39.697
Okay. What'd I do?

16:39.722 --> 16:41.866
- You're rude.
- News flash.

16:42.246 --> 16:44.283
Like this is the first time you've noticed?

16:44.308 --> 16:47.267
It's the first time I've been
called a simple-minded asshat.

16:47.292 --> 16:48.740
I was saying that about people who...

16:48.742 --> 16:50.275
Oh, come on.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.777
Are you saying you're
one of those people who...

16:53.105 --> 16:54.744
Wait, are you saying you want...

16:54.777 --> 16:56.877
Jesus, Sadita, don't flatter yourself.

16:56.902 --> 16:59.536
Oh, thank God. I thought
you were about to...

16:59.539 --> 17:02.688
As if. We've known each
other for, like, five minutes.

17:02.759 --> 17:04.228
Then why?

17:04.877 --> 17:08.319
Because someday I do want to get married.

17:08.547 --> 17:11.513
- Not to you.
- Why not to me?

17:11.516 --> 17:14.084
Because you're rude.

17:14.086 --> 17:15.484
Fair.

17:15.487 --> 17:18.021
And when it's right between two people,

17:18.022 --> 17:19.609

You <i>are</i> simple.

17:22.877 --> 17:24.294
Where I'm from, getting married

17:24.296 --> 17:25.796
is how you show someone that you love them.

17:25.798 --> 17:27.396
Where I'm from, getting married

17:27.398 --> 17:28.899
is when you start to hate each other.

17:28.901 --> 17:31.400
I swear, my dad went to jail
just to get away from my mom,

17:31.402 --> 17:34.623
and I don't count on it
being any different for me.

17:34.939 --> 17:36.670
So what do you count on?

17:37.174 --> 17:38.440
My future.

17:38.442 --> 17:40.076
It's the only thing I can count on.

17:40.078 --> 17:41.644
And I count on mine.

17:41.646 --> 17:42.945
You should.

17:42.947 --> 17:43.842
I do.

17:46.984 --> 17:50.251
So does this mean you're not
gonna have sex with me later?

17:50.788 --> 17:51.988
Maybe if you beg.

17:51.990 --> 17:54.889
[scoffs] I wouldn't count on it.

17:54.891 --> 17:56.394
I would.

18:00.596 --> 18:02.631
Oh, thanks for saving me out there.

18:02.633 --> 18:04.165
Yeah. Are you always like this?

18:04.167 --> 18:05.934
Oh. Sorry my speech was bad.

18:05.936 --> 18:08.721
No. I'm not just talking about
the thoughtless speech, Jenna.

18:08.746 --> 18:09.996
All you've been doing today

18:10.021 --> 18:12.290
is been making rude
faces at Adam and Tamara.

18:12.542 --> 18:14.509
See, it's that face right there.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.577
Why are you so unsupportive of them?

18:16.579 --> 18:18.746
It's your best friend in
love with my best friend.

18:18.748 --> 18:21.215
- Because she's not!
- Okay. What do you mean?

18:21.217 --> 18:24.128
- Why would you say that?
- Because it's the truth, Brian.

18:24.153 --> 18:25.819
They had this fun little thing in Mexico,

18:25.821 --> 18:27.522
and she got carried away
and agreed to marry him

18:27.524 --> 18:28.889
because she thought he'd be shipping off

18:28.891 --> 18:30.331
before she ever had to go through with it,

18:30.356 --> 18:32.126
and she got all caught
in these wedding details,

18:32.128 --> 18:34.645
and she doesn't love
him, and she never did.

18:37.687 --> 18:38.649
Jenna.

18:41.905 --> 18:43.706
She never did.

18:44.139 --> 18:45.570
Is that true?

18:52.789 --> 18:54.953
Tamara, I am so sorry.

19:00.388 --> 19:02.120
Pigs in a blanket, anyone?

19:05.902 --> 19:07.435
T, I messed up everything,

19:07.437 --> 19:09.471
and you have every right to be mad at me.

19:09.473 --> 19:11.429
I don't know how I feel.

19:11.642 --> 19:14.076
I'm mad at you. I'm mad at me.

19:14.078 --> 19:18.097
And I feel horrible that
I hurt him because I...

19:19.206 --> 19:21.283
[bleep]. [bleep].

19:21.285 --> 19:23.285
[bleep], [bleep], [bleep].

19:23.287 --> 19:25.386
- What?
- I love him.

19:25.411 --> 19:28.089
- Tamara, no...
- Don't do that.

19:28.091 --> 19:31.025
Don't tell me I don't, because I do.

19:31.027 --> 19:33.961
I love him. I love Adam.

19:33.963 --> 19:36.197
I might love wedding planning,
but I can love Adam too.

19:36.199 --> 19:38.066
I have enough love in my heart for both.

19:38.068 --> 19:39.589
- T.
- Don't "T" me, Jenna.

19:39.614 --> 19:41.042
I'm pissed.

19:41.067 --> 19:42.261
I'm sorry.

19:42.286 --> 19:44.685
Not at you, at me. [sniffles]

19:44.973 --> 19:47.174
I'm the one that acted like an idiot,

19:47.176 --> 19:50.763
and now the guy I love just
walked out of my life forever.

19:51.780 --> 19:53.780
Okay, I guess I'm pissed at you too.

19:53.782 --> 19:55.683
I can be pissed at you and be pissed at me.

19:55.685 --> 19:57.928
I have enough anger and despair for both.

20:00.822 --> 20:03.257
I have to let the butterflies go.

20:07.956 --> 20:11.760
(Jenna) I felt terrible about
sabotaging Tamara's relationship,

20:11.785 --> 20:13.566
but it was the thought
of another relationship

20:13.568 --> 20:15.836
that was starting to give me butterflies.

20:15.838 --> 20:18.371
Did Matty really have feelings for me?

20:18.373 --> 20:19.238
[girl laughing]

20:19.263 --> 20:22.497
And was that Gabby in
my yard with no pants on?

Next on Awkward...

20:25.206 --> 20:27.894
<i>What if Adam is my Mr.
Big, and I just let him go?</i>

20:27.910 --> 20:28.894
Calm down.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.329
You are a relationship saboteur.

20:30.331 --> 20:32.031
(Jenna) Am I the reason
my relationships fail?

20:32.033 --> 20:35.319
I don't have time to detail all
of the drama that you caused.

20:35.344 --> 20:36.519
I got to go find my girlfriend,

20:36.535 --> 20:38.468
and if she's not here, where is she?

20:38.470 --> 20:39.936
[both scream]

20:39.938 --> 20:41.578
- What are you doing here?
- [knock at door]

20:41.603 --> 20:43.992
Was Matty here? I wasn't ready for this.
