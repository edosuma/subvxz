We waive further reading
of the complaint,

COLIN: Please the court, Your
Honor, at this time,

14:15.369 --> 14:17.066

ask that bail be denied.

14:17.110 --> 14:18.850
JUDGE: On what grounds?

14:18.894 --> 14:20.504
COLIN: A DEA agent has
identified the defendant

14:20.548 --> 14:23.246
as the shooter,
the defendant fled the scene,

14:23.290 --> 14:24.900
and when he was
finally apprehended,

14:24.943 --> 14:26.989
he was driving a vehicle
not in his name,

14:27.033 --> 14:28.643
he had thousands of dollars
of cash on him,

14:28.686 --> 14:31.080
along with
a fake driver's license.

14:31.124 --> 14:33.082
Your Honor,
we believe Mr. Saint

14:33.126 --> 14:34.431
could pose
a significant flight risk.

14:34.475 --> 14:36.346
Your Honor, this young man

of 21 years of age

14:44.137 --> 14:45.921
Your Honor, the defense
implores Her Honor

14:45.964 --> 14:48.489
to follow her instincts

14:48.532 --> 14:50.360
and grant bail.

14:51.970 --> 14:54.103
I'm persuaded
by the people's argument.

14:54.147 --> 14:55.278
