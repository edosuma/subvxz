<i>Acknowledge when in
position, Sergeant Davis.</i>

00:55.200 --> 00:57.967
Dagger Team 1, copy. I keep losing you.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.633
<i>- How long till my backup's here?
- Working on it. Stand by.</i>

01:01.800 --> 01:05.700
[explosion, then rumbling]

01:07.067 --> 01:09.867
<i>Say eight to ten minutes.
Advise you stay put.</i>

01:11.333 --> 01:12.633
I can't wait for backup.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.100
Send them in behind me.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.267
<i>Davis, maintain your position.
They're on their way.</i>

01:20.333 --> 01:22.633
[whirring]

01:55.633 --> 01:56.633
[tinkling]

02:16.967 --> 02:18.633
[whirring]

02:26.900 --> 02:30.133
Dagger Team 1, you seeing this?
There's some kind of disturbance here.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.233
<i>Davis, what is that? What are you seeing?</i>

02:45.133 --> 02:46.600
What the hell?

02:57.167 --> 02:58.167
<i>Davis.</i>

02:59.600 --> 03:00.967
<i>Davis, what's your status?</i>

03:01.033 --> 03:02.600
[radio static]

03:03.267 --> 03:04.267
<i>Davis, come in!</i>

03:04.833 --> 03:05.900
[whirring]

04:09.167 --> 04:10.167
[man] Got you.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.333
{\an8}[man 1]... gonna get a late start.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.280
{\an8}[man 2]
Right, well, it's a closed session.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.667
[woman]
Most of the specs stayed the same...

04:46.733 --> 04:49.600
<i>[man over PA]
Dr. Osbourne, call 204. Dr. Osbourne, 204.</i>

04:49.667 --> 04:51.033
{\an8}[indistinct chattering]

04:53.033 --> 04:55.967
{\an8}[man 1] They're issuing temporaries
for that R and D, as far as I know.

04:56.033 --> 04:57.833
[man 2]
Is that part of the same badge or...?

04:57.900 --> 04:58.900
[man 3] I'm pretty sure.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.100
- [man 2] All right.
- [man 4] How's it going?

05:00.167 --> 05:01.333
- [man 5] Hey.
- [man 6] Hi.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.900
- [man 7] We'll get everything.
- [man 8] Marty was already in?

05:03.967 --> 05:04.833
[man 9] Yeah.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.700
[man 10]
And she's working on that project?

05:06.767 --> 05:09.167
[man 11] They'll be done in about a week.
I was gonna say...

05:09.233 --> 05:13.133
<i>[man over PA] Don Taylor, report
to Laser Laboratory Building B, Laser Lab.</i>

05:14.367 --> 05:17.667
[man 1] Okay, I'll take a look.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.627
- Where have you been?
- [Clyne] Solving problems.

05:21.833 --> 05:23.233
You look... dusty.

05:23.867 --> 05:25.633
Sometimes you gotta get dusty, Efrem.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.100
- Test the pulse?
- Yeah.

05:27.167 --> 05:29.867
Went down to the vault,
asked Johnson for some tetracene,

05:29.933 --> 05:31.800
but apparently, we don't store it.

05:31.867 --> 05:34.267
It's outdated and expensive as shit.

05:34.700 --> 05:38.033
It got expensive.
Back in the '90s, it used to be cheap.

05:38.700 --> 05:41.967
So, if you look hard enough...
you can still find some lying around.

05:43.267 --> 05:45.300
You find a street gang
that slings tetracene?

05:45.367 --> 05:47.833
Industrial printer cartridge,
$14.99 back in the day.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.833
- Get me a mount, would you?
- Here you go.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.033
Thank you.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.933
[Efrem] You gonna tell the suits
you're running this on a 20-year-old part?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.700
I'll show them it works and say:

05:56.767 --> 05:59.833
"That's the difference between a prototype
and a production model."

06:01.800 --> 06:02.800
Okay.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.200
Concavity is spun to zero.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.733
Lens track is hot.

06:09.267 --> 06:10.933
Alignment is keyed in.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.633
You are good to go.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.633
I'll let you call it.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.100
[whirring, then beeping]

06:19.633 --> 06:22.267
[powering up]

06:29.167 --> 06:32.933
If you think about the applications on
other materials, it could be significant.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.033
Metals, for instance, can be shattered
with very little effort or noise.

06:37.633 --> 06:42.000
Concrete, rubber... they're all vulnerable
to violent temperature changes.

06:42.067 --> 06:46.767
Yeah, this project started
as a request from SEAL Team 6.

06:46.833 --> 06:48.200
After the siege in Rwanda,

06:48.267 --> 06:51.333
they came to us
asking for the capability...

06:51.600 --> 06:54.367
to flash freeze or boil
the enemy's water supply.

06:54.633 --> 06:58.200
Now, this device could have
driven the enemy out.

06:58.267 --> 07:00.933
And you... tried this on living things?

07:03.367 --> 07:07.667
That wasn't our intent here, initially.

07:08.933 --> 07:09.967
We'd like you test it.

07:11.267 --> 07:12.367
Any volunteers?

07:12.633 --> 07:14.367
[chuckling]

07:14.633 --> 07:17.000
[chuckles] Well... we'll give it a try.

07:17.067 --> 07:20.800
Gentlemen, why don't we go sit down?
We'll talk over the next steps. All right?

07:21.633 --> 07:22.833
Yeah. Right this way.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.200
[indistinct chattering]

07:29.100 --> 07:31.033
[Mindala] What do you want,
a clean conscience?

07:31.267 --> 07:33.667
Test it with a slab of beef
for all I care.

07:33.733 --> 07:36.833
What I want is to use it
for what we originally designed it as.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.200
A deterrent.

07:38.867 --> 07:41.267
Nobody said anything
about microwaving people's lungs.

07:41.333 --> 07:42.333
It's war.

07:43.700 --> 07:44.967
It's the business we're in.

07:45.033 --> 07:47.367
Remember what you sold it to me as
when you hired me?

07:48.600 --> 07:49.733
Defense.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.700
[chuckles]
And that's still partially true.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.267
But war is good business.

07:54.067 --> 07:55.300
So is human trafficking.

07:55.367 --> 07:59.000
We work for DARPA, Mark.
We work for the government.

07:59.867 --> 08:02.267
"I don't know what weapons
we'll use in World War III,

08:02.333 --> 08:06.233
- but World War IV will be fought with..."
- "Sticks and stones." Albert Einstein.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.633
- He worked for the government.
- Mm-hm. That's right.

08:09.367 --> 08:12.733
And if you ask him, I don't think
he thought that was his finest hour.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.300
I'm sure he has feelings about
flash-boiling human flesh.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.600
Ever think about prosthetic limbs
with full sensory feedback?

08:18.667 --> 08:21.367
Ah. Prosthetics... don't win wars.

08:22.933 --> 08:23.933
Did you hear that?

08:24.700 --> 08:26.500
That is the empathetic scientist
in you dying.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.600
Hmm.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.600
Did you brief your guys
on how to operate the ray?

08:30.967 --> 08:31.967
- I did.
- Good.

08:32.332 --> 08:33.732
Then you can start packing.

08:34.866 --> 08:36.000
Can you be more specific?

08:36.067 --> 08:37.067
Mm-hm.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.667
About these goggles.

08:39.732 --> 08:43.067
Your... hyperspectral goggles

08:43.133 --> 08:48.033
being deployed by Special Forces
in Eastern Europe in the Moldovan War.

08:48.833 --> 08:52.133
- I'm aware. I read the field reports.
- No, you have not read this report.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.800
Orland called me personally.
General Orland.

08:55.867 --> 08:59.267
He said things are very...
sensitive down there.

09:00.300 --> 09:03.833
And they're... seeing things.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.600
Okay. Like what?

09:08.200 --> 09:09.200
They won't tell me.

09:10.100 --> 09:13.667
They won't share the video feed.
They won't discuss what they're seeing.

09:13.733 --> 09:16.767
They just want the lead engineer
down there to advise and consult.

09:17.867 --> 09:21.100
Look, you invented these goggles
to keep our guys safe.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.067
Well, now they need your help.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.167
Think of it as defense.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.480
[man 1] Let me reboot the guidance system.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.561
[man 2] It's locked tight.
We have to pull it out.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.440
{\an8}[man 3] All right, let's go. Move it out.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.300
[indistinct chattering]

10:08.967 --> 10:10.300
- Mark Clyne?
- What?

10:10.967 --> 10:12.833
You the guy that designed
the helmet cam?

10:12.900 --> 10:15.600
- Yes. Mark Clyne.
- James Orland. Come with me.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.200
[Clyne]
A lot of new boots on the ground here.

10:21.267 --> 10:22.633
[Orland] The country's in chaos.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.267
The insurgency is mostly remnants
of the military dictatorship

10:26.333 --> 10:28.667
that ran this place
until about two months ago.

10:29.167 --> 10:32.700
And their popular support is primarily
in the north part of the country...

10:32.767 --> 10:35.333
near the Russian border,
and here in the capital.

10:36.067 --> 10:38.167
The problem is
their forces are well-trained.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.667
They're threatening to turn
this whole thing into a civil war.

10:42.333 --> 10:47.067
[indistinct chattering]

10:47.133 --> 10:49.967
Moldova. Russians had it, lost it.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.667
It became independent,
but it's struggling internally.

10:54.733 --> 10:56.700
On the one hand, you have an insurgency,

10:57.033 --> 10:59.700
made up of the regime's
former elite soldiers.

10:59.767 --> 11:01.600
They're well-trained and dangerous.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.900
On the other,
you have most of the population,

11:03.967 --> 11:07.300
who are tearing down the regime's flags
and demanding a new government.

11:07.367 --> 11:11.967
Civil unrest, as complicated as it is,
is a business we're familiar with.

11:12.033 --> 11:13.700
We like to think we're good at it.

11:15.033 --> 11:16.733
But this thing your camera found...

11:17.800 --> 11:19.300
it's a whole new piece of business.

11:26.833 --> 11:30.233
I can't send this video to EUCOM.
I'm just afraid they'd think it's a joke.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.940
[Clyne]
DOD doesn't have a sense of humor.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.033
[Orland] Typically not. Hook us up.

11:37.233 --> 11:39.967
I'm sure there's a scientific explanation
for what's on these,

11:40.033 --> 11:41.033
but until you tell me,

11:41.100 --> 11:43.067
I'm not sending it
up the chain of command.

11:45.933 --> 11:47.133
- You done?
- [man] Yes, sir.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.200
- Get out. Seal us in. Wait outside.
- Sir.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.200
[door closes]

11:54.267 --> 11:57.267
Nobody here has been able
to make heads or tails of this.

11:57.933 --> 12:00.167
It's thrown a wrench
into our entire operation

12:00.233 --> 12:02.833
for reasons I'm not at liberty
to discuss with you.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.733
I can tell you we need answers fast.

12:29.967 --> 12:32.200
- Do you mind?
- You spotted that quick.

12:35.667 --> 12:39.367
Five different helmet cams picked up
something similar in the last three weeks.

12:42.200 --> 12:45.367
At first, our signals intelligence tech
wrote it off as interference.

12:46.067 --> 12:47.333
That's not interference.

12:49.367 --> 12:52.667
I don't think you'd fly me
all the way here for interference.

12:53.367 --> 12:55.133
Wanna tell me what you're thinking?

12:55.200 --> 12:57.167
I want you to tell me
what you're thinking.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.300
I don't know what I'm thinking... yet.

13:00.967 --> 13:02.633
But there is an explanation.

13:06.067 --> 13:08.733
[Orland] That was the first sighting.
Three others just like it.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.133
The last was different.
It involved a member of Delta Force,

13:12.200 --> 13:13.967
that makes it particularly sensitive.

13:14.733 --> 13:16.100
This is Fran Madison with CIA.

13:16.767 --> 13:19.700
What Special Ops does here
is done under CIA covert operations.

13:19.767 --> 13:22.000
You need to sign this
before we go any further.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.333
- What is this?
- It's an SCI oath.

13:25.600 --> 13:29.333
You're acknowledging it's life in prison
if you reveal anything you're told.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.300
{\an8}[door buzzing and clanging]

13:50.267 --> 13:51.267
[beeping]

13:53.067 --> 13:55.033
[door buzzing]

14:05.333 --> 14:07.700
- [Fran] Cue up the Davis file, please.
- [man] Yes, ma'am.

14:08.167 --> 14:10.967
Three days ago
we conducted a raid in mid-city.

14:11.700 --> 14:15.267
Our communications were intermittent,
and a guy got separated from the group...

14:16.300 --> 14:18.000
where he ended up killed in action.

14:20.633 --> 14:22.300
He got closer than anybody.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.100
Too close.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.033
[radio static]

14:38.100 --> 14:39.333
[whirring]

14:44.100 --> 14:47.633
<i>[Davis] Dagger Team 1, you seeing this?
There's some kind of disturbance here.</i>

14:49.233 --> 14:51.633
<i>[man over radio]
Davis, what is that? What are you seeing?</i>

14:51.933 --> 14:53.000
<i>[Davis] What the hell?</i>

14:59.900 --> 15:01.100
[radio static]

15:04.700 --> 15:05.933
Sergeant Chris Davis.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.267
Three-tour combat vet. Best of the best.

15:16.867 --> 15:19.800
In the last few weeks
we've been finding bodies around the city

15:19.867 --> 15:21.300
that were killed in the same way.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.700
The autopsies defied all explanation.

15:24.767 --> 15:26.733
Their internal organs were frozen

15:26.800 --> 15:29.833
and yet, their skin was burned
and corroded.

15:30.267 --> 15:34.667
The only response from the allied Moldovan
military contact is shock, confusion.

15:34.933 --> 15:35.933
And there's anger.

15:36.767 --> 15:40.333
There's teenagers spray-painting
"genocide aratare" at kill sites.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.733
- Genocide...?
- "Aratare."

15:41.800 --> 15:44.333
It's a local myth. The ghosts of war.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.300
"As nightmarish as."
That's the literal translation.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.167
- That's very poetic.
- [Fran] Well, they're superstitious.

15:51.233 --> 15:53.033
They somehow think...

15:54.233 --> 15:57.767
the horrors of the war have
kicked up something unnatural.

15:58.733 --> 16:01.367
- We hope you have an alternate theory.
- What do you think?

16:02.667 --> 16:04.900
- Think you need a new name for them.
- Beyond that.

16:05.833 --> 16:08.700
- Give me a copy of the data, some time...
- That's not possible.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.800
You want me to figure this out right now?

16:10.867 --> 16:13.107
- [Orland] We want your assessment.
- I don't have one yet.

16:13.133 --> 16:16.600
Then, I think we have to send our
working theory up the chain of command.

16:16.667 --> 16:19.233
- I don't wanna do that.
- Okay. What is your working theory?

16:19.800 --> 16:22.667
The agency thinks
this is some kind of cloaking technology.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.233
Insurgent soldiers wearing
active camouflage.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.233
In this country? Something that advanced?

16:28.300 --> 16:31.800
CIA knows a few groups in Europe and Asia
could be working on active camouflage.

16:32.267 --> 16:36.000
DARPA's worked on cloaking technology.
We're years away from a prototype.

16:36.067 --> 16:39.333
- Maybe somebody beat you to it.
- DARPA is the leader in the field.

16:39.600 --> 16:40.700
Are you certain of that?

16:41.233 --> 16:43.800
The regime spent heavily
on weapons research.

16:43.867 --> 16:47.267
Corruption, loose legislation.
You're a military lab and want obscurity?

16:47.333 --> 16:49.833
- This is a great place to work and hide.
- Okay.

16:54.733 --> 16:56.267
Let's say it is cloaking technology.

16:57.833 --> 17:01.267
- How do you account for cause of death?
- A shock delivered to the victim.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.300
I think you're reaching.

17:03.367 --> 17:05.666
Our business requires us
to make suppositions.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.599
My business requires us to prove them.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.767
Your technician's job is to find glitches,
so, he sees glitches.

17:12.767 --> 17:15.300
Your job is to find the enemy,
so, you see the enemy.

17:16.233 --> 17:18.367
Locals believe in spirits,
so they see spirits.

17:18.633 --> 17:21.032
Everyone is biased, in one way or another.

17:22.133 --> 17:25.666
So, my answer to you right now is that
we lack data to support any theory.

17:26.267 --> 17:27.267
Okay.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.933
What do you need
to make a more definitive statement?

17:40.967 --> 17:42.300
First, you need a better shot.

17:42.367 --> 17:44.633
That's what I'm looking for,
a better shot.

17:45.233 --> 17:46.267
How?

17:47.967 --> 17:49.233
- Right here, sir.
- That's it.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.233
I brought this from DARPA.
A hyperspectral camera.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.267
A more powerful version of the helmet cams
your guys are using.

17:58.333 --> 18:00.333
It sees deeper into the spectrum of light.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.600
Visible or invisible,
if something's there, this'll pick it up.

18:04.133 --> 18:07.267
Can you mount this thing...
on a Delta vehicle?

18:07.333 --> 18:09.300
- I don't see why not.
- [Orland] All right, good.

18:09.367 --> 18:11.367
We run missions into the city every day.

18:11.767 --> 18:14.633
I'll put you with our field tech,
tell him how to operate it.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.167
I wouldn't put a tech in between
this camera and myself.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.067
So, you wanna operate it?

18:22.867 --> 18:26.600
If you want that kill shot... you'll need
a fast reaction time out there.

18:26.933 --> 18:28.700
Next mission, you ride with Delta.

18:29.300 --> 18:33.100
They're gonna get you close to this thing.
You get me the kill shot...

18:33.967 --> 18:36.067
you can go home to Virginia
without unpacking.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.633
[man 1]
Got a bad rotor, you gotta swap that out.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.900
[man 2] Weld it onto the front panel.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.333
[indistinct chattering]

18:52.133 --> 18:54.200
Well, well, well. Toll, check that out.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.200
- [man 1] What's this guy up to, man?
- [man 2] I don't know.

18:57.267 --> 18:58.600
[man 3] Believe this guy?

18:58.667 --> 19:00.333
- [man 4] If it works.
- [man 5] For real.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.600
[whistles]

19:03.033 --> 19:05.133
Heard you're installing a camera
on our truck.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.600
Which was fine
until you ripped out that 50 cal.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.667
You're taking down a gun
to put up a camera?

19:10.133 --> 19:12.200
It's the only place large enough
to mount it.

19:13.167 --> 19:16.133
[Toll] You guys get that, right?
I know it sounds like a terrible idea.

19:16.833 --> 19:20.933
We prefer to dance with who brung us...
Dr. Clyne. You get that, right?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.233
"Dance with who brung you"?
No, actually, I don't.

19:26.167 --> 19:28.600
This truck has saved our lives,
many times.

19:28.867 --> 19:29.867
I understand.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.800
[Cabrera] You guys know Dr. Clyne's team
built that truck?

19:34.133 --> 19:35.700
Clyne works over at DARPA.

19:37.267 --> 19:41.200
I've worked closely with his group.
Been to their facilities in Virginia.

19:41.733 --> 19:44.667
- Good to see you, Dr. Clyne.
- Good to see you, Captain Cabrera.

19:44.733 --> 19:47.967
They retrofitted these trucks
with tougher, lighter weight armor.

19:48.033 --> 19:50.967
They designed the mechanical loaders
that do the heavy lifting,

19:51.033 --> 19:53.200
so you boys don't strain yourselves
too hard.

19:53.867 --> 19:55.333
Matter of fact, Dr. Clyne himself

19:55.800 --> 19:58.667
developed the thin weight Kevlar
body stocking that literally...

19:58.733 --> 19:59.894
[Toll grunts] [soldiers groan]

19:59.933 --> 20:00.933
Protects your balls.

20:01.900 --> 20:06.000
So, I would think there'd be nothing
but goodwill in this group for Dr. Clyne.

20:08.333 --> 20:11.200
- Major Sessions.
- Captain, have your men fall back.

20:12.233 --> 20:14.367
- [man 1] Get back to it.
- [man 2] Get her done.

20:14.633 --> 20:15.333
This is Dr. Clyne.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.300
He's worked with us eight or ten times
over the last five years.

20:19.167 --> 20:21.067
You ever go out with the assault team?

20:22.067 --> 20:23.067
No, sir.

20:23.733 --> 20:24.767
He's a good man, major.

20:24.833 --> 20:28.100
That's great. I'm just not a fan
of taking tourists on combat missions.

20:28.367 --> 20:29.600
Sir, I'm not a tourist.

20:29.933 --> 20:32.233
If you're not carrying an M4,
you're a tourist.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.800
I'll carry one, if you'd like.

20:33.867 --> 20:35.600
We gotta get Dr. Clyne out in the field

20:35.667 --> 20:37.900
to track the target force
and get a kill shot.

20:37.967 --> 20:40.000
How long before
this equipment's operational?

20:40.367 --> 20:41.367
A few hours.

20:41.733 --> 20:43.700
- Is it gonna work?
- If we get close enough.

20:44.900 --> 20:48.600
Let me tell you something.
Sergeant Davis... he got close enough.

20:50.067 --> 20:51.733
That's the best Delta that we had.

20:53.233 --> 20:56.100
Make sure your equipment
is top-notch this time.

21:04.367 --> 21:06.067
- They were like brothers.
- I get it.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.000
Okay.

21:12.167 --> 21:13.033
Evening, doc.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.200
[indistinct chattering]

21:27.967 --> 21:29.867
[Cabrera] Hear you two hit it off bigtime.

21:29.933 --> 21:30.933
[chuckles]

21:33.267 --> 21:37.767
- She can come off a bit intense.
- Yeah. So can you.

21:37.833 --> 21:39.633
I'm just here to find this thing.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.900
You're willing to go on
a combat mission to find it.

21:44.667 --> 21:45.833
She is, too.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.167
She's under a lot of pressure from D.C.

21:49.233 --> 21:51.833
They want an answer
and it's her job to give them one.

21:51.967 --> 21:53.767
Saw your names on a mission roster.

21:54.633 --> 21:56.867
I knew this was a top priority...

21:58.333 --> 22:00.000
but for them to embed you both...

22:03.233 --> 22:05.100
Well, you don't have to worry about me.

22:05.767 --> 22:08.933
I'm not worried about you, doc.
I'm worried about it.

22:10.933 --> 22:13.067
She's hoping it's cloaking technology.

22:14.733 --> 22:15.867
What do you think it is?

22:17.833 --> 22:19.367
Something no one's thought of yet.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.333
Gentlemen, yesterday at 1800 hours,

22:26.600 --> 22:29.333
Utah Team left here on a recon mission
to Durlesti,

22:29.600 --> 22:31.200
when they were engaged by insurgents.

22:31.267 --> 22:34.233
We managed to hear most
of their chatter during the firefight,

22:34.300 --> 22:35.700
but come were unreliable.

22:36.167 --> 22:38.900
Target is a five-story
apartment building here.

22:39.833 --> 22:43.033
We think what's left of Utah Team
is being held on the fourth floor,

22:43.200 --> 22:44.867
in the northwest corner apartment.

22:44.933 --> 22:47.267
We're gonna be knee-deep
in an insurgent-held area.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.333
So, we should expect a fight.

22:50.133 --> 22:51.133
One last thing.

22:52.833 --> 22:55.600
Before our guys were grabbed,
they radioed in that they saw

22:55.667 --> 22:57.667
what we're calling
hyperspectral anomalies.

22:58.233 --> 23:01.700
Your mission is a quick extraction.
You get our guys and you get out.

23:02.200 --> 23:06.167
However, if engaged,
neutralize the anomalies in the area.

23:06.233 --> 23:07.233
[Toll] Neutralize them?

23:09.733 --> 23:12.200
- How?
- Yeah, what are we dealing with here?

23:12.267 --> 23:15.833
We believe these are enemy soldiers
in advanced electronic camouflage.

23:15.900 --> 23:19.167
- So, be surgical when you fire.
- If we don't really know what they are...

23:19.233 --> 23:21.867
Excuse me?
Would you like to add something?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.867
If they are wearing cloaking technology,

23:25.933 --> 23:28.733
you need to bring it back
as intact as possible.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.300
Dr. Clyne and Agent Madison
will be on mission with you.

23:32.133 --> 23:34.767
Dr. Clyne will be monitoring
your helmet-cam feeds

23:34.833 --> 23:36.800
from the second MRAP vehicle
in the convoy.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.800
Major Sessions will lead Dagger Team 1
to do the extraction.

23:42.067 --> 23:43.800
Stay on come. Get your gear.

23:46.767 --> 23:49.233
- [man 1] Partner, let's go.
- [man 2] AJ, front and center.

23:49.867 --> 23:51.867
[man 3] Weapons check, Billy.

23:52.800 --> 23:53.867
[man 4] You got it.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.167
<i>[man 1]
Our ride not smooth enough for you?</i>

24:30.233 --> 24:32.000
<i>[man 2]
And you call yourself hard-ass.</i>

24:32.067 --> 24:34.333
<i>[man 3] They really need
to repave these roads, man.</i>

25:00.733 --> 25:03.133
All right, guys,
we're coming into the abandoned zone.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.633
Expect a heavy insurgent presence.

25:43.100 --> 25:44.461
[indistinct chattering over radio]

26:47.300 --> 26:48.300
[man] Okay.

27:25.667 --> 27:27.347
<i>[Sessions]
I've got an insurgent body here.</i>

27:35.767 --> 27:39.100
I got Agopia from Utah Team.
Confirmed KIA.

27:39.600 --> 27:43.100
<i>None of these guys appear to have taken
any rounds. No entry or exit wounds.</i>

27:44.867 --> 27:47.167
Alessio here. Moving to the fifth floor.

27:59.100 --> 28:01.600
- We got movement.
- Toll, check your 2 o'clock.

28:09.833 --> 28:11.100
Where? We don't see anything.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.667
- That's it. Right there.
- You're right on top of it.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.667
<i>[Clyne] It's a motion signature.
There's something under that tub.</i>

28:24.900 --> 28:27.933
[Sessions] Lewis, the tub.
I want you to flip over the tub.

28:33.333 --> 28:36.367
- Toll, I want you on what's underneath.
- I'm on it.

28:40.367 --> 28:44.000
One, two, three.

28:50.167 --> 28:52.800
We have Comstock alive and conscious.

28:52.867 --> 28:55.900
<i>Repeat. We have Sergeant Comstock
from Utah Team.</i>

28:55.967 --> 28:56.967
[grunts]

28:57.867 --> 28:59.100
[grunting]

29:02.100 --> 29:03.167
Hey, buddy.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.300
- Where's the rest of your team?
- They're upstairs.

29:08.333 --> 29:10.800
But they're all gone.
Got under their skin.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.933
- What got under their skin...?
- I saw it.

29:14.167 --> 29:15.300
- But...?
- Blanket.

29:16.667 --> 29:17.867
Like a frozen blanket.

29:18.667 --> 29:22.133
- Okay, where is the rest of Utah?
- Oh, they're dead.

29:23.700 --> 29:25.633
Yeah, they're all dead.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.333
We're all dead.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.100
<i>- Where are the bodies?
- I told you, they're on the top floor.</i>

30:07.067 --> 30:08.300
Oh, you haven't seen it.

30:09.900 --> 30:12.800
I've seen it.
You know I believe in God, John.

30:14.033 --> 30:15.733
This is the opposite of God.

30:27.633 --> 30:29.867
Wait. Who's this?
Can you tell him to turn back?

30:29.933 --> 30:32.267
McFadden, turn back.
Give us a view of that room.

30:33.133 --> 30:35.173
[McFadden] Nothing's there.
I'm standing right here.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.767
Mac, we're both staring right at it.
It's in the middle of your view port.

30:39.233 --> 30:41.600
What? That? It's a smear.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.867
Probably these piece-of-shit goggles.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.900
- No, no, no. Tell him to put them back on.
- Mac, put the goggles back on.

30:49.800 --> 30:50.967
<i>Mac, do it now.</i>

30:57.000 --> 30:58.800
- What the...?
- Take the shot.

31:02.067 --> 31:03.267
They went right through it.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.900
- Did he miss?
- He doesn't miss.

31:05.333 --> 31:06.700
[whirring]

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
Major Sessions, we have a KIA.
McFadden.

31:15.067 --> 31:18.000
<i>A hyperspectral target is
on the fifth floor, northwest corner.</i>

31:18.067 --> 31:19.700
<i>Switch to heavy rounds or 203s.</i>

31:19.767 --> 31:22.000
<i>Whatever you have to do
to bring this thing down.</i>

31:26.767 --> 31:28.067
[grunting]

31:35.867 --> 31:36.867
[thudding]

31:37.867 --> 31:38.867
Tell them to pull out.

31:42.933 --> 31:43.933
[thudding]

31:45.833 --> 31:46.833
There!

31:57.333 --> 31:58.633
[grunts]

31:59.100 --> 32:00.333
<i>[man] Get everyone out now!</i>

32:00.600 --> 32:03.600
- Tell them to pull out now.
- No, we're not leaving empty-handed.

32:03.667 --> 32:05.367
I guarantee you're leaving empty-handed.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.800
Come on!

32:09.833 --> 32:10.833
[man 1] Grenade!

32:12.333 --> 32:14.033
<i>- We need support!
- [Cabrera] Get out.</i>

32:14.100 --> 32:17.033
All units evacuate now.
Let's go. Get back to the truck.

32:23.633 --> 32:24.633
[grunting]

32:25.367 --> 32:29.267
[man 1] This room right here.
We can still grab him. Let's go! Move!

32:29.333 --> 32:31.333
[man 2] Let's go, let's go, let's go.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.767
[man 3] Go!

32:32.833 --> 32:34.967
[man 4] Here. Here, Jim.
Hold on. Here.

32:37.267 --> 32:40.667
Evacuating via south face!
I got Talbot, Comstock, Riedel and Shaire.

32:40.733 --> 32:41.900
<i>Five men down!</i>

32:43.033 --> 32:45.033
[whirring]

32:45.100 --> 32:48.633
We gotta travel together
and we gotta stay tight. Can you do that?

32:54.300 --> 32:56.700
[grunting] Oh, Jesus. Go!

32:59.800 --> 33:01.367
[Clyne] Come on. Come on.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.633
Move. Move, move.

33:12.333 --> 33:13.600
[screeching]

33:14.633 --> 33:15.633
[grunts]

33:17.867 --> 33:18.867
[gasps]

33:22.767 --> 33:23.900
[grunts]

33:25.167 --> 33:26.667
[grunts]

33:26.733 --> 33:27.933
[man] You got him? Let's go.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.800
[grunting]

33:50.900 --> 33:51.900
Get out of the way.

33:53.233 --> 33:54.267
Where?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.067
- Right there!
- Where is it?

33:56.133 --> 33:57.333
In front.

34:02.333 --> 34:03.600
We gotta get in. Move.

34:05.067 --> 34:06.100
- Help him in.
- Come on!

34:06.167 --> 34:07.300
- Get in here!
- In you go.

34:22.367 --> 34:23.367
No.

34:23.967 --> 34:25.199
No.

34:44.033 --> 34:44.900
[man 1] Go, go!

34:44.967 --> 34:46.333
- [man 2] Move!
- [man 3] Get in.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.699
- Hey!
- [man 4] Go, go!

34:48.933 --> 34:49.967
We're in! Go!

34:58.800 --> 35:00.933
Hold on, where's Cabrera?
Where's the captain?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.333
Talk to me. Did you see him?

35:02.600 --> 35:04.767
- Come on, talk to me, man.
- I saw him die.

35:05.167 --> 35:06.633
- What?
- I saw him die.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.267
- I'm going home.
- [Fran] Yeah.

35:12.333 --> 35:14.300
- I'm going home.
- Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

35:14.367 --> 35:15.600
Look at me. Look at me.

35:16.933 --> 35:18.900
- Did you see it?
- Yeah.

35:20.667 --> 35:24.200
- You saw it. How close did you get?
- I was in a room with it for hours.

35:26.967 --> 35:28.000
That tub saved my life.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.300
I could feel it.

35:34.167 --> 35:35.167
[whimpers]

35:35.600 --> 35:36.667
- Okay.
- I could feel it.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.100
Land mines! Hold on!

35:42.233 --> 35:43.233
[grunting]

35:49.933 --> 35:51.767
[grunting]

36:16.333 --> 36:17.900
[grunting]

36:17.967 --> 36:18.967
[coughing]

36:21.967 --> 36:23.933
[coughing continues]

36:24.800 --> 36:27.000
Hey, buddy, look at me. No, no, no.

36:29.167 --> 36:30.167
Shit.

36:32.600 --> 36:33.633
[man 1] Open the door.

36:37.167 --> 36:38.167
[man 2] Yeah.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.767
- [man 1] Come on. Now, move.
- [man 3] Come on.

36:47.867 --> 36:49.100
Both drivers are dead.

36:49.933 --> 36:53.000
Archer Lima 2. Hit a land mine.

36:53.067 --> 36:54.700
Both vehicles destroyed.

36:54.767 --> 36:56.167
[radio static]

36:56.233 --> 36:57.233
We are...

36:58.733 --> 37:01.700
three clicks southeast of target building.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.521
<i>[man over radio]
We are losing your transmission.</i>

37:05.633 --> 37:06.867
<i>Your transponders are down.</i>

37:06.933 --> 37:09.267
No shit.
Our vehicles were just blown to hell.

37:09.333 --> 37:10.600
We need to find cover.

37:11.100 --> 37:14.200
<i>- I can't hear what you're saying.
- Clyne, leave the camera.</i>

37:15.667 --> 37:17.033
[man 1] Come on, Clyne.

37:24.967 --> 37:25.967
[man 2] Go, go, go.

37:29.700 --> 37:30.700
[man 3] Move, move.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.200
[man 4] Cover.

37:38.033 --> 37:39.700
- Let's go.
- [man 5] Get up, get up.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.133
[man 1] Come on.

37:41.167 --> 37:42.733
[man 2] Go, go, go.

37:44.067 --> 37:45.200
[man 4] Where you been?

37:45.333 --> 37:46.333
[Sessions shouts]

37:46.767 --> 37:47.900
Clear.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.367
[Sessions] Who's injured?

37:49.833 --> 37:51.733
- Diaz?
- [Diaz] I think my ankle's broke.

37:53.067 --> 37:56.100
We need an airlift.
I can't get a signal to base. Keep trying.

37:56.167 --> 37:57.900
[Talbot] Com.
Get over here. Get over here.

37:57.967 --> 37:58.967
[man] Yeah.

38:01.267 --> 38:03.200
[Talbot] Archer Lima 2. Archer Lima 2.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.100
This is Dagger Team 1, over.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.167
[man 1] I'm good. I'm good.

38:09.167 --> 38:10.933
[man 2] Can they get in that way?

38:12.933 --> 38:13.933
[man 3] You all right?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
[Talbot]
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger Team 1.

38:16.067 --> 38:17.233
Do you copy? Over.

38:20.233 --> 38:23.900
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger Team 1.
Do you copy? Over.

38:25.767 --> 38:26.967
Hey.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.267
- How you doing? You're bleeding.
- Hmm?

38:36.267 --> 38:37.267
Okay.

38:38.300 --> 38:39.333
You hit your head.

38:40.700 --> 38:41.700
You hit your head.

38:44.367 --> 38:45.367
Did you black out?

38:47.867 --> 38:48.900
Yeah, I guess so.

38:50.933 --> 38:51.933
Major.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.300
- She hit her head pretty bad.
- Let me see.

38:59.733 --> 39:00.633
Pupils are huge.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.667
Sir, I'm sending
but they're not receiving.

39:02.733 --> 39:05.667
I'm hearing a click back
as soon as I sign over, but no answer.

39:05.733 --> 39:06.600
Keep trying.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.600
She's in shock. Keep an eye on her.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.700
[Talbot] Archer Lima 2,
this is Dagger Team 1. Do you copy? Over.

39:11.800 --> 39:12.833
[man 1]... over there.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.233
- Thanks.
- [man 2] Yeah.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.967
Where's everyone else?
Where's the rest of Utah?

39:17.933 --> 39:20.200
I'm Sergeant Chen. I was with Utah.

39:21.333 --> 39:25.367
We were the second team in last night.
There was eight of us.

39:28.233 --> 39:31.833
- Do you have confirmed KIAs for Utah?
- Well, I can tell you this much.

39:32.367 --> 39:35.167
Sergeant Comstock won't be
on your Christmas card this year.

39:35.833 --> 39:38.267
- You saw insurgents kill Comstock?
- [Alessio] Insurgents?

39:38.633 --> 39:39.733
Is this guy for real?

39:41.633 --> 39:44.133
- What rock were you under?
- I was the radio operator.

39:44.367 --> 39:47.033
We lost come.
I was stuck in the truck the whole night.

39:47.100 --> 39:49.833
- I never saw the active camouflage.
- Active camouflage?

39:49.900 --> 39:52.233
Even if there was a such thing,
and there's not...

39:53.900 --> 39:56.767
how does a human wearing active camouflage
walk through walls?

39:56.833 --> 39:59.267
[Alessio] Or through three mags
of armor-piercing ammo?

39:59.333 --> 40:01.733
I saw Pat pump 150 rounds at one of them.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.067
This thing's killed
at least 19 of our men.

40:06.767 --> 40:08.600
And we have no idea what it is.

40:14.767 --> 40:15.767
Clyne.

40:18.600 --> 40:19.600
You saw it.

40:20.733 --> 40:21.733
What was it?

40:23.233 --> 40:24.233
Human.

40:26.900 --> 40:27.933
Had a human form.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.167
It looked at me, it was conscious.

40:35.233 --> 40:36.233
Like a person.

40:37.767 --> 40:38.767
[scoffs]

40:41.333 --> 40:43.767
Is there anything that explains
what you saw?

40:45.033 --> 40:46.033
No.

40:48.200 --> 40:51.000
Let's pull together
all the functional goggles that we have.

40:51.233 --> 40:55.167
- My goggles were wasted in the crash, sir.
- Yeah. Mine, too. They're trashed.

40:55.233 --> 40:57.733
[man] Forget the goggles.
We can't recharge them anyway.

40:58.333 --> 40:59.367
So, what do we do?

41:00.367 --> 41:01.967
How are we supposed to see them?

41:02.200 --> 41:03.933
Maybe that camera can still help us.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.733
If we get to an elevated position,
we'd have a better vantage point.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.800
Help me with this?

41:12.300 --> 41:14.600
[Sessions] Let's go. Let's move out. Move.

41:28.600 --> 41:32.667
[whirring]

41:33.333 --> 41:36.867
[whirring]

41:43.300 --> 41:44.633
[Sessions] They're everywhere.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.033
[Alessio] Something's stopping them.

41:58.033 --> 41:59.933
Some sort of black sand.

42:00.900 --> 42:02.333
[Comstock] I fell in that sand.

42:03.167 --> 42:05.933
- I had to... pick it out of my hand.
- Let me see it.

42:09.833 --> 42:12.700
- Little, sharp pieces of metal.
- They're iron filings.

42:13.933 --> 42:15.633
- It's pure iron.
- [man] Yeah.

42:16.100 --> 42:19.667
And there's a trail of it...
all the way around the building.

42:26.267 --> 42:28.367
It's a barrier. Someone put it there.

42:31.667 --> 42:32.867
I don't think we're alone.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.233
Let's stack up and sweep upstairs.

42:39.800 --> 42:40.800
Point and shoot?

42:41.633 --> 42:42.767
Point and shoot.

43:19.067 --> 43:21.600
[indistinct chattering]

43:52.333 --> 43:53.333
Breach! Breach!

43:56.233 --> 43:57.233
[screaming]

44:01.233 --> 44:03.100
[girl speaking in foreign language]

44:03.733 --> 44:05.700
- [Sessions] I've got kids.
- [man 1] Clear.

44:05.767 --> 44:07.033
- [man 2] Clear.
- All clear.

44:08.700 --> 44:10.100
Tell them to take the long wall.

44:19.033 --> 44:21.767
Ask them where they got this,
and who else is here.

44:21.833 --> 44:23.867
[speaking in foreign language]

44:27.133 --> 44:30.733
Ask them if there's anyone else
in the factory, and do they have guns.

44:30.800 --> 44:33.233
[speaking in foreign language]

44:43.233 --> 44:45.200
[in English] She says they're here alone.

44:45.933 --> 44:48.067
Only that one gun. No soldiers are here.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.300
- No one at all.
- [man] Major Sessions.

44:56.900 --> 44:59.700
- What's the problem?
- This factory has a transmission tower.

44:59.933 --> 45:01.133
It puts out a huge signal.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.033
So, what's the problem?

45:03.667 --> 45:06.200
Everyone within 20 miles will hear
our conversation with base.

45:07.067 --> 45:09.300
Any insurgent radio will pick up
our transmission.

45:10.767 --> 45:13.700
Insurgents are the least of your worries.

45:13.767 --> 45:15.967
Connect me to General Orland
as soon as possible.

45:18.700 --> 45:21.633
Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2,
this is Dagger Team. Do you copy?

45:21.767 --> 45:25.900
[radio static]

45:25.967 --> 45:28.933
<i>Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2,
this is Dagger Team. Do you copy?</i>

45:32.900 --> 45:36.633
<i>Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2,
this is Dagger Team. Do you copy?</i>

45:50.700 --> 45:52.181
[Toll] You guys are our new recruits.

45:53.167 --> 45:55.700
And believe me... we could use the help.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.133
[both chuckling]

46:05.200 --> 46:07.200
Come on, tough guy. Show me what you got.

46:07.267 --> 46:08.933
[grunting, then chuckling]

46:10.933 --> 46:12.633
[Clyne] Hey, I need to ask you something.

46:13.367 --> 46:17.867
Was it your idea...
to put the barrier... outside?

46:17.933 --> 46:20.633
[speaking in foreign language]

46:20.700 --> 46:23.033
[in English]
Their father. Their father knew.

46:23.700 --> 46:28.200
Their father rolled open barrels
of the iron shavings around the building.

46:29.233 --> 46:30.333
He saved their lives.

46:32.967 --> 46:34.367
What happened to your father?

46:35.967 --> 46:38.167
[Toll] You're a little scrapper,
aren't you? [Chuckling]

46:38.733 --> 46:40.333
[grunting]

46:42.233 --> 46:44.267
[Toll] Hey, buddy, you all right?
Come on, get up.

46:47.200 --> 46:48.200
What are you doing?

46:51.000 --> 46:52.167
[mimics swooshing]

46:54.333 --> 46:55.333
[mimics roaring]

47:00.867 --> 47:01.867
Are you a ghost?

47:01.933 --> 47:03.000
Mm.

47:03.067 --> 47:04.000
Aratare.

47:04.067 --> 47:05.733
[speaks in foreign language]

47:06.133 --> 47:08.833
- He says, "Don't say that word."
- Ask him what they are.

47:08.900 --> 47:11.100
[Fran & Bogdan speaking
in foreign language]

47:11.167 --> 47:12.167
[in English] Lost souls.

47:13.067 --> 47:14.067
Souls of the dead.

47:16.300 --> 47:20.233
They're trapped between life and death,
and they can't find peace.

47:22.133 --> 47:23.300
How's that happen?

47:26.833 --> 47:27.867
He says, "War."

47:37.300 --> 47:38.300
Come on.

47:42.967 --> 47:44.933
If their father put down
the iron shavings,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.267
he knows more about these things
than any of us do.

47:48.233 --> 47:49.700
Ask her where her father is.

47:50.933 --> 47:52.267
[speaking in foreign language]

48:22.167 --> 48:23.800
[speaking in foreign language]

48:24.300 --> 48:26.333
[in English]
Her brother, Bogdan, doesn't know.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.600
He thinks he went to get help.

48:30.900 --> 48:33.333
He died outside,
when he was making the barrier.

48:34.167 --> 48:35.700
She had to bring him in here.

48:36.667 --> 48:37.667
I'm so sorry.

48:40.800 --> 48:42.767
- Okay?
- Yeah.

48:49.867 --> 48:51.067
Ceramic tile.

48:53.367 --> 48:56.867
Ask her how her father knew about
the iron filings stopping the Aratare.

48:57.633 --> 49:00.767
- What else did he know about them?
- [Fran] She doesn't know.

49:05.900 --> 49:06.900
[Clyne] "Masarov."

49:08.000 --> 49:09.900
- What is Masarov?
- [Fran] It's a place.

49:09.967 --> 49:11.333
It's a district up the river.

49:11.967 --> 49:13.167
[speaking in foreign language]

49:14.100 --> 49:15.200
It's where it all began.

49:18.233 --> 49:20.633
It's where the Aratare killings started.

49:21.267 --> 49:22.267
Aratare.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.133
I'm saying we land the helos right here.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.933
Extract us from this roof
and get us the hell out of here.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.767
There are power lines everywhere.
The helos would have to fly low and slow.

49:33.833 --> 49:35.967
Easy pickings
for a teenager with a rocket.

49:36.633 --> 49:38.767
Can you get me up to speed?
You spoke with base?

49:38.833 --> 49:41.733
Yeah. The general's sending in helos
to come get us,

49:42.200 --> 49:45.333
and tanks to secure the landing zone
in an open plaza

49:45.600 --> 49:49.300
- about half a mile from here, at dawn.
- That's a long way on foot.

49:50.200 --> 49:52.900
You think we can make it a half a mile?
With kids?

49:52.967 --> 49:56.267
We don't have an option. Okay?
All the roads are either blocked or mined.

49:56.333 --> 49:58.333
And since we used the tower
to talk to base,

49:58.600 --> 50:00.867
everyone knows where we are.
We gotta move out.

50:00.933 --> 50:04.167
[Alessio] You wanna go running around
with those things roaming the streets?

50:04.233 --> 50:06.133
Even though we have no way to fight them?

50:06.200 --> 50:08.600
[man 1] Better than waiting for them
to find a way in.

50:08.667 --> 50:11.507
[Alessio] The only reason we're
still alive is that barricade out there.

50:11.600 --> 50:14.233
Eventually they're gonna get through.
It's just a matter of time.

50:14.300 --> 50:16.767
- [man 2] Wait.
- [Sessions] We have to take our chances.

50:16.833 --> 50:18.933
- This is the best plan that we have.
- Major.

50:19.733 --> 50:22.600
What if I said I can improve our chances
of making that plaza?

50:22.667 --> 50:24.667
- I'm listening.
- Take a look around you.

50:24.733 --> 50:28.867
Everything in this building...
is filled with this.

50:29.733 --> 50:30.733
Iron dust.

50:32.267 --> 50:34.600
And the iron stops the hyperspectrals.

50:34.667 --> 50:36.700
Exactly. Weaponize it.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.300
- Dirty bombs.
- Best idea I've heard all night.

50:40.133 --> 50:41.367
Let's collect the grenades.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.233
[Sessions] Clyne.

51:19.767 --> 51:21.333
I need you to be our eyes out there.

51:21.600 --> 51:24.167
- Can you haul that camera on foot?
- I've got a better idea.

51:25.633 --> 51:28.300
This camera already projects
the right wavelength of UV light.

51:29.333 --> 51:33.267
If I can turn it inside out, by reversing
the polarity of some of the components,

51:33.733 --> 51:36.333
I might be able to turn it from a camera
into a searchlight.

51:37.067 --> 51:39.067
We'll be able to see them
with our own eyes.

51:39.800 --> 51:42.833
- That'd be a game-changer.
- Think I can talk to the convoy?

51:42.900 --> 51:45.267
I'll them how to do the same
with their equipment.

51:45.333 --> 51:47.867
When they come get us,
they're gonna need eyes, too.

51:48.300 --> 51:50.767
I'll connect you
to the main engineer back at base.

52:07.133 --> 52:08.167
Copy that.

52:10.033 --> 52:12.900
They're ready to equip their vehicles
with whatever you need.

52:13.167 --> 52:15.800
Can you repeat
the whole request back to me, please?

52:15.867 --> 52:17.333
<i>Okay, yes. That's correct.</i>

52:17.600 --> 52:20.967
<i>What you need is a device that emits
a very short wavelength of light.</i>

52:21.033 --> 52:23.233
<i>I can tell you exactly how to rewire that.</i>

52:23.967 --> 52:26.000
<i>Do you have anything
you can mount on a tank?</i>

52:54.633 --> 52:57.100
[girl speaking in foreign language]

53:16.900 --> 53:18.767
[Alessio]
We got movement across the alleyway.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.700
Guys, we got movement.
Can we get eyes on it?

53:24.367 --> 53:26.200
[man]
Hey, guys, stand clear for a second.

53:28.133 --> 53:31.200
- What's the word on the convoy?
- Last contact was 50 minutes ago.

53:31.867 --> 53:34.000
They're on their way
to the extraction point.

54:00.233 --> 54:04.167
Here they come! Get your gear.
We're leaving this building in 15 seconds.

54:04.233 --> 54:05.800
[man] Okay, come on. Let's go.

54:06.267 --> 54:08.667
That was the fastest way
to the extraction point.

54:09.033 --> 54:09.967
- [girl] Yeah.
- Hey.

54:10.033 --> 54:11.267
She says she can show us another way.

54:11.333 --> 54:14.133
Talbot, you're with Clyne.
Diaz, you're on point.

54:20.767 --> 54:21.800
[man] Let's go.

54:26.833 --> 54:28.100
[Sessions] Yup. Moving.

54:35.900 --> 54:37.067
[creatures screeching nearby]

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Okay, let's go.

54:43.367 --> 54:44.367
Come on.

54:48.800 --> 54:49.800
Come here.

54:51.033 --> 54:52.833
[man 1] Everybody's accounted for.

54:54.600 --> 54:56.667
- [man 2] It looks clear.
- Let's move. Come here.

54:56.733 --> 54:58.033
Okay. [Speaks in foreign language]

54:58.100 --> 54:59.867
[in English] She says, "Go right, here."

55:07.300 --> 55:09.867
[man 1] Hey. Heads up, 6 o'clock.

55:12.067 --> 55:13.600
- [man 2] Move!
- Move!

55:13.667 --> 55:14.733
Move!

55:16.167 --> 55:17.200
[man 3] They're coming.

55:20.367 --> 55:21.367
[man 4] Come on.

55:22.833 --> 55:23.833
Come on.

[grunting]

55:45.267 --> 55:46.267
[man 1] Oh, shit.

55:48.200 --> 55:51.067
- [man 2] Come on, Lewis! Let's go!
- [man 3] I think it's working!

55:54.733 --> 55:56.733
- [Sessions] In here!
- [man 1] This way.

55:58.067 --> 55:59.367
[man 2] Move, move.

56:00.200 --> 56:01.200
[man 3] Go!

56:02.167 --> 56:05.167

56:18.733 --> 56:20.100
Go!

56:20.967 --> 56:22.000
[screeching]

56:22.067 --> 56:23.633

- [man 2] Come on.

56:23.700 --> 56:25.233

- [man 1] Get up.

56:25.300 --> 56:27.133

56:35.233 --> 56:36.600
[Sessions] Steady your gun!

56:38.667 --> 56:40.667
- [man 1] Get down!
- [man 2] Take cover, man.

56:41.667 --> 56:43.000
Come on, doctor. Come on.

56:44.033 --> 56:45.033
[man 1] Incoming!

56:47.700 --> 56:49.100

56:53.700 --> 56:55.100

Run!

57:05.133 --> 57:07.333
- [man 1] Moving it up!
- [man 2] More on that side!

57:13.667 --> 57:15.133
[Sessions] Hurry.

57:15.200 --> 57:17.367
[girl speaking in foreign language]

57:17.633 --> 57:19.767
[Fran] She says,
"Straight ahead, under the archway."

57:20.367 --> 57:21.733
[man] Watch yourself.

57:22.267 --> 57:23.733
[girl speaks in foreign language]

57:24.300 --> 57:26.341
- [man]Hold it.
- [Fran] She says this is the place.

57:27.033 --> 57:28.033
[Sessions] Go, go.

57:35.233 --> 57:36.233
[man] Looks clear.

[Fran speaking in foreign language]

57:43.967 --> 57:45.000
[whirring]

57:45.067 --> 57:46.933
- [man] Where are they?
- Get on the bus. Go.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.333
[man] Where's the rescue?

57:51.367 --> 57:53.033
[crackling]

57:53.367 --> 57:54.700
[man] Where's the light?

57:56.100 --> 57:59.133
Come on. Come on, come on.
Work. Work. Work.

57:59.767 --> 58:01.067
[Fran speaking in foreign language]

58:01.133 --> 58:02.667
[in English] Come on. It's okay.

58:03.667 --> 58:06.300
- [Sessions] You sure this is the place?
- [speaking in foreign language]

58:06.367 --> 58:08.167
- Yeah.
- Ask them if they're sure.

58:08.833 --> 58:10.167
She said, "I'm pretty sure."

58:10.967 --> 58:13.633
[whirring]

58:15.067 --> 58:16.100
Major.

58:17.333 --> 58:19.167
This thing is dead. We can't see them.

58:21.667 --> 58:22.667
We're blind.

58:29.233 --> 58:32.167
[rumbling]

58:51.033 --> 58:53.600
- That's us.
- This is the landing zone.

[whirring]

59:41.200 --> 59:44.267
- Commander, are you seeing this?

Base is that way.

01:05:08.233 --> 01:05:10.767
- We're not going to base.
- Why not?

01:05:10.833 --> 01:05:12.233
It's been compromised.

01:05:17.333 --> 01:05:19.300
Hey,
they're spreading through the streets.

[whimpering]

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.667
- They just gonna leave us here?
- There's more people to airlift.

01:05:58.733 --> 01:06:00.967

[soldiers speaking in foreign language]

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.867

Hey.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.067
Okay. It's okay.

01:07:02.633 --> 01:07:03.767

Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me.

01:07:10.033 --> 01:07:12.000

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.000
- [man] What the hell happened to base?
- Base got overrun.

01:07:27.067 --> 01:07:29.767
- The general is meeting us here.
- So, what is this place?

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.300
We're in a civilian refugee shelter.

01:07:32.967 --> 01:07:36.000
This bunker has 20 feet
of concrete and steel.

01:07:36.067 --> 01:07:38.933
Are we safe here? I have no idea.
But there's food and water.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.067
Talbot, gather what you can.
Toll, Chen, head back to the entrance.

01:07:42.133 --> 01:07:44.133
There's a com center.
See who you can reach.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.900
Alessio, you're with me. Let's go.

01:07:47.933 --> 01:07:49.200

01:07:49.267 --> 01:07:50.767

- Okay.
- [man] On the bed.

01:07:52.067 --> 01:07:53.933
You're okay. Shh. You're gonna be okay.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.067
- [man] What happened?
- It's her shoulder.

01:07:57.133 --> 01:08:00.267
- Her shoulder has shrapnel in it.
- [man] We're gonna cut open her sleeve.

01:08:14.933 --> 01:08:15.933
[Clyne] This is yours.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.233
Now, I need your help, Sari,
to stop the Aratare.

01:08:20.733 --> 01:08:22.600
I need to know what your father knew.

01:08:23.067 --> 01:08:24.267
What did your father do?

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.133
- [speaks in foreign language]
- He worked with ceramics.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.133
What did he make?

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.267
[Fran & Sari speaking in foreign language]

01:08:33.767 --> 01:08:35.300
[in English] He made containers.

01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:41.367
He made containers for Masarov.

01:08:42.733 --> 01:08:45.332
The power plant
where the Aratare came from.

01:08:47.033 --> 01:08:48.313
[man] Let's get the mask on her.

01:08:49.067 --> 01:08:50.367
Okay, we have to take her now.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.899
[rumbling]

01:08:52.966 --> 01:08:55.267
[indistinct chattering]

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.667
[siren wailing]

01:09:01.767 --> 01:09:04.332
- [man] This is the U.S. Armed Forces!
- Open it.

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:15.800
Lower your weapons.

01:09:34.633 --> 01:09:36.966
- How many are you?
- Not many.

01:09:51.133 --> 01:09:52.600
Let's give them a hand.

01:09:53.966 --> 01:09:54.967
[man 1] Let's go.

01:09:56.133 --> 01:09:57.700
[man 2] Bring as much as you can.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.167
<i>[Orland] The base was overrun.</i>

01:10:00.733 --> 01:10:01.767
It was like a wave.

01:10:03.067 --> 01:10:04.067
Invisible.

01:10:04.933 --> 01:10:06.733
Men just started falling.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.800
Our conventional weapons were useless.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.667
I requested an order
to evacuate the base...

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.100
but our long-range come
are completely scrambled.

01:10:17.133 --> 01:10:18.900
So, I took all the gear I could.

01:10:18.967 --> 01:10:22.033
I started sending units north
out of the area of operation.

01:10:23.733 --> 01:10:25.933
Kept five aircraft
with the least amount of fuel,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.367
stayed behind with one platoon.

01:10:31.067 --> 01:10:33.333
Out of the 240 of us,
we have 19 remaining.

01:10:36.967 --> 01:10:38.967
[Sessions] Did you get a message
to higher command?

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.600
[Orland] No.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.633
- Is there a rescue mission planned?
- No. We intercepted radio chatter

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.800
from Moldovan friendlies
to find this place.

01:10:46.867 --> 01:10:49.167
We sent that bird to pick you up
and bring you here.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.700
If you'd even tried to return to base,
you'd be dead.

01:10:54.233 --> 01:10:56.200
We're the last U.S. forces in the country?

01:10:57.167 --> 01:10:58.167
I hope so.

01:11:00.333 --> 01:11:01.667
So, what's the plan, sir?

01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:03.600
Came here to regroup, major.

01:11:04.333 --> 01:11:05.333
There's no plan.

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:14.800
- I recommend we fortify the entrance.
- Fortify with what?

01:11:14.867 --> 01:11:17.700
- We wait till a rescue mission...
- Fortify with what?

01:11:17.767 --> 01:11:19.667
They'll come through whatever you use.

01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:23.600
- We need to take our chances on a helo...
- There's 20 minutes of flight time!

01:11:23.667 --> 01:11:26.100
Twenty minutes of flight time
in those birds. Not more!

01:11:26.167 --> 01:11:28.333
There's not enough room
for all of us anyway.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.033
We need to form teams
and take the aircraft.

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:33.000
But where you gonna go, major?

01:11:34.233 --> 01:11:35.600
You can't run from them.

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.067
You can't stop them.
Your weapons are useless.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.900
We have no idea what they are!

01:11:42.767 --> 01:11:45.167
[man 1] If they come through
that door, we're sitting ducks.

01:11:45.233 --> 01:11:47.233
[man 2] We can't stop them!
We can't stop them!

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:48.833
[indistinct chattering]

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.233
[man 3] Take what we can and go.

01:11:57.833 --> 01:11:58.833
I know what they are.

01:12:03.067 --> 01:12:04.133
I know what they are.

01:12:05.967 --> 01:12:07.067
I know what they are.

01:12:07.767 --> 01:12:08.967
[chattering stops]

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.367
We think we're seeing things.

01:12:13.133 --> 01:12:15.800
We think it can't be real, but it kills.
So, it is real.

01:12:16.367 --> 01:12:17.367
It's something.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.300
It's not light, it's not shadow,

01:12:19.367 --> 01:12:21.900
or some trick of the mind.
Pass through walls, check.

01:12:23.233 --> 01:12:24.967
Outside the visible spectrum, check.

01:12:26.333 --> 01:12:27.700
Kills to the touch, check.

01:12:29.367 --> 01:12:32.800
Comstock. He was under a ceramic bathtub,
is that right?

01:12:34.133 --> 01:12:36.333
Tank armor.
It couldn't pass through tank armor.

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.367
M1 Abrams tank armor,
that's ceramic plating everywhere.

01:12:39.633 --> 01:12:42.600
It cannot pass through ceramic.
You know what that means?

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.200
It means this stuff isn't natural.

01:12:46.767 --> 01:12:47.767
Someone made it.

01:12:49.333 --> 01:12:50.633
It's man-made.

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:53.000
Man-made how?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.933
Okay. You have solid, liquid, gas.
Lava can turn into rock.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.067
Ice can turn into water. Metals can melt.
These are natural states.

01:13:02.133 --> 01:13:05.200
But there are unnatural states.
Artificial states, man-made states.

01:13:06.767 --> 01:13:07.767
Condensate.

01:13:08.867 --> 01:13:10.100
Bose-Einstein condensate.

01:13:10.767 --> 01:13:13.933
A state of matter that was predicted
by Nath Bose and Albert Einstein.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.833
It has some very unusual properties.
It can be slowed down by iron filings.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:21.033
It cannot pass through ceramic,
but it can pass through walls.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.600
It's so cold it will kill you instantly
on contact.

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:25.700
It can do everything
we've been seeing here.

01:13:25.767 --> 01:13:29.333
To create Bose-Einstein condensate,
you need power, and you need a lot of it.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.233
Masarov. The power plant.

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.233
Yes, Masarov. Where they were made.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:36.300
You said this country was pouring billions
into weapons research.

01:13:37.067 --> 01:13:38.067
This is a weapon.

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.033
- And it was set loose, or it broke loose.
- All right, but these things climb.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.600
They're like humans.
It looks like a person.

01:13:45.067 --> 01:13:47.200
So can marble and clay in the right hands.

01:13:47.267 --> 01:13:48.333
And I wanna know why.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.333
Why they look like people.
I can't tell you how they did this.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.633
What I can tell you...
is that someone made them.

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:58.700
If someone made them, they don't escape
the laws of the world. Nothing does.

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:01.800
It shines light on new laws,
and that's what we have to learn.

01:14:01.867 --> 01:14:04.600
- They have order and structure.
- They can be broken down.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:08.300
Anything can be. It's just energy.
And since I know what they are,

01:14:08.367 --> 01:14:11.333
- I can build the right weapons.
- What kind of weapons?

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.133
Plasmic-discharge.
They can tear apart the condensate.

01:14:14.733 --> 01:14:18.133
- Where will we find weapons like that?
- We're gonna build them.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:21.100
- Build them with what?
- Anything we can find in this bunker.

01:14:21.167 --> 01:14:23.700
Anything with electronics.
Optics, ballistic casings.

01:14:23.767 --> 01:14:25.667
All the gear you brought from base.

01:14:25.733 --> 01:14:28.233
We can take it all apart,
and I can build an arsenal.

01:14:28.667 --> 01:14:31.900
And then we can go to Masarov
and stop this before it goes any further.

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:35.633
Because if we don't, the condensate
will feed on all the energy in its path.

01:14:36.067 --> 01:14:37.067
It'll grow exponentially.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:39.900
There's no limit
to how far they can spread.

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.667
Unless we stop them.

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:48.633
[man 1]
Let's get this gear inside, guys. Come on.

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:49.833
[man 2] Let's move!

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.267
[man 1] Same number each side.

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.833
[man 2] All right, let's go, boys!

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.100
[indistinct yelling]

01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.000
[man 1] Any med patches in there?

01:15:26.067 --> 01:15:27.800
[man 2]
We got three of them over here.

01:15:28.067 --> 01:15:31.667
It's a ground-to-air tracking scope.
We can use this. They have good optics.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.600
- Good. This is good.
- [man 1] Two more over there.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:36.767
[man 2] See that 305?

01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:39.933
Half of these are labeled "defective."
We need a voltage counter.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.600
I want you to start testing these.

01:15:44.867 --> 01:15:46.233
[man 1] All right, open it up.

01:15:51.167 --> 01:15:52.767
[man 2] Get that one open. Pop it.

01:15:54.033 --> 01:15:55.233
Is that what I think it is?

01:15:56.133 --> 01:15:57.933
[man 1] We got the lotus from base.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
[Alessio] That's badass.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.133
- Looks like a mechanical Rottweiler.
- Look at that.

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:04.067
Clyne's making a few changes.

01:16:04.133 --> 01:16:07.067
[Alessio] They're taking down a chain
hoist and putting up a searchlight.

01:16:07.967 --> 01:16:08.967
DÃ©jÃ  vu.

01:17:14.867 --> 01:17:18.000
- What does it fire?
- It's a focused energy pulse.

01:17:18.833 --> 01:17:20.033
If my math is right...

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.600
[whirring]

01:17:22.067 --> 01:17:23.967
It should break down condensate.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.300
[Orland] Masarov.

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.733
The single largest power plant
in the region.

01:17:37.733 --> 01:17:41.200
It's where the killings started.
If they're man-made, they were made here.

01:17:41.267 --> 01:17:43.067
It's less than ten clicks from here.

01:17:44.233 --> 01:17:47.367
Our birds can make that,
but... it's probably one way.

01:17:48.067 --> 01:17:51.833
I've been digging for clues with
the civilians. I found intel on Masarov.

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:55.167
It's been retrofitted several times
over the last decade

01:17:55.367 --> 01:17:56.667
by the central regime.

01:17:56.833 --> 01:17:58.967
It's got "weapons research"
written all over it.

01:17:59.033 --> 01:18:01.733
Okay, you and Clyne need to be
embedded to infiltrate.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.333
It's up to the both of you
to figure out how to stop this.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.600
We have to create a diversion.

01:18:07.133 --> 01:18:10.267
We'll draw them out here
so you can infiltrate the structure

01:18:10.333 --> 01:18:12.000
and try to find the source.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:20.133
Clyne's predicting the charge from these
will be extremely hot.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.967
Enough to destroy condensate.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:23.933
We'll find out soon enough.

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:28.833
All right, boys.

01:18:29.733 --> 01:18:30.733
This is it.

01:18:32.267 --> 01:18:33.767
If you have any last words...

01:18:34.633 --> 01:18:35.633
now's the time.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.200
[guns cocking]

01:19:03.733 --> 01:19:05.000
<i>[Orland] All right, listen up.</i>

01:19:05.933 --> 01:19:07.967
<i>You are using untested weapons...</i>

01:19:09.267 --> 01:19:12.867
against an enemy that, to this point,
has been unstoppable.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.867
Now, you are heading
into unknown territory.

01:19:15.933 --> 01:19:19.300
And hear me when I say you're gonna
see things you will not understand.

01:19:19.967 --> 01:19:22.733
Our enemy has spread through the city
in a matter of days.

01:19:23.233 --> 01:19:25.633
There's no telling
how far they will spread...

01:19:26.267 --> 01:19:27.333
unless we fight back.

01:19:29.867 --> 01:19:33.933
Most men never even come close...
to changing the future.

01:19:37.167 --> 01:19:38.167
This is the place.

01:19:40.267 --> 01:19:41.867
And now is the time.

01:19:43.633 --> 01:19:46.600
Make no mistake,
you're the last line of defense.

01:19:48.967 --> 01:19:51.833
Let's go do what we came here to do.

01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:54.933
[guns cocking, then powering up]

01:20:06.933 --> 01:20:08.167
[man] Let's go, let's go!

01:20:10.767 --> 01:20:11.967
[indistinct yelling]

01:20:52.767 --> 01:20:53.767
[sighs]

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:01.900
One minute.

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.167
<i>[Sessions] Thirty seconds.</i>

01:21:13.067 --> 01:21:14.833
<i>[man] Spearhead 1, proceed with descent.</i>

01:21:25.233 --> 01:21:26.367
[man] All right, let's go.

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:32.100
[man] Here we go.

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:50.733
[whirring]

01:22:07.733 --> 01:22:09.200
[powering up]

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.800
Let's move!

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.667
<i>[man over radio] We have a visual.</i>

01:22:19.767 --> 01:22:22.767
<i>Hostile target gathering at 12 o'clock
on east end of platform.</i>

01:22:24.667 --> 01:22:25.667
[man] Move, move!

01:22:30.733 --> 01:22:32.667
[whirring]

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:34.967
<i>[man over radio] We are a go.</i>

01:22:37.133 --> 01:22:38.800
[powering up]

01:23:29.633 --> 01:23:31.067
I have a confirmed spectral kill.

01:23:32.333 --> 01:23:34.767
We're a go. I say again, all units go.

01:23:34.833 --> 01:23:37.333
- Let's show them what we've got.
- Come on.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.767
- [man 1] This is it!
- [man 2] Let's do it!

01:23:38.833 --> 01:23:39.933
[man 3] Let's go. Drop.

01:23:41.133 --> 01:23:43.767
<i>[man 1 over radio] Copy, Spearhead 1.
All units engage.</i>

01:23:44.267 --> 01:23:46.387
<i>[man 2 over radio]
Spearhead 2 taking north peninsula.</i>

01:23:47.867 --> 01:23:50.667
<i>[man 3 over radio] Spearhead 3 beginning
descent over south peninsula.</i>

01:23:51.333 --> 01:23:53.667
<i>[man 4 over radio]
At least a dozen targets coming out.</i>

01:23:54.133 --> 01:23:56.000
- [man 1] Go! Go!
- [man 2] Let's move!

01:23:56.067 --> 01:23:58.900
<i>- [man 3] On me!
- [man] All units, you are clear to engage.</i>

01:23:59.933 --> 01:24:01.133
- [man 4] Move in!
- Move it!

01:24:02.233 --> 01:24:03.367
[indistinct yelling]

01:24:03.667 --> 01:24:04.800
[man 5] Lock and load.

01:24:04.867 --> 01:24:06.147
- [man 6] Move out.
- Let's move.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:08.733
[man 7] Right behind you!

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.521
<i>[man over radio]
Weapons free! Weapons free!</i>

01:24:11.033 --> 01:24:12.167
[man 8] Let's go. Move up!

01:24:13.733 --> 01:24:15.233
- [man 9] Move!
- [man 10] Come on!

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:18.733
- [man 11] I said go, go, go!
- [man 12] Move!

01:24:22.867 --> 01:24:26.067
<i>[man over radio] Spearhead 2, you're go
for infield. Proceed to insertion point.</i>

01:24:30.933 --> 01:24:32.133
Go, go, go!

01:25:27.867 --> 01:25:28.867
[gasps]

01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:29.900
[man] Get down!

01:25:32.667 --> 01:25:33.833
[roaring]

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:47.200
Right there.

01:25:54.833 --> 01:25:57.300
- Toll!
- Go! Go!

01:25:58.667 --> 01:25:59.933
Go, go, go!

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:07.600
[man 1] Go, go, go!

01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:12.000
- [man 2] Somebody get on top!
- [man 3] Down right there!

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.367
- [man 4] We got more incoming!
- Keep formation!

01:26:14.633 --> 01:26:15.633
[man 5] Let's move it!

01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:23.267
[man 6] Fight! Fight!

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
[man 7] Move!

01:26:27.867 --> 01:26:30.067
- [man 8] Let's go, go, go!
- [man 9] Go, John!

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.833
[man]
Do we have a sit-rep? Right now.

01:26:36.133 --> 01:26:38.600
<i>[Sessions]
Clyne, what's the situation down there?</i>

01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:40.733
Sessions, we got split up.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.600
- We're still looking for the lab.
- We're holding. Don't know how long.

01:26:45.067 --> 01:26:47.833
<i>- Do you copy?
- Can you hear me? Sessions?</i>

01:26:51.267 --> 01:26:52.267
We gotta keep going.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.067
[Fran] We gotta be close now.

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:15.800
[beeping]

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.033
[thudding, then clanging]

01:27:31.933 --> 01:27:33.067
[Fran] God.

01:27:47.867 --> 01:27:48.900
Look over here.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.667
[Clyne] Bose-Einstein condensate.

01:28:06.033 --> 01:28:07.200
Look at these x-rays.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.333
They were scanning people.
On a molecular level.

01:28:17.233 --> 01:28:22.300
[whirring]

01:28:22.967 --> 01:28:24.800
And printing them out of condensate.

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:33.033
It's an assembly line.

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.267
Like some kind of...

01:28:36.267 --> 01:28:38.000
industrial process.

01:28:38.767 --> 01:28:39.767
You're right.

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:42.800
It's a weapon.

01:29:02.867 --> 01:29:04.367
[all whimpering]

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:17.000
[whimpering continues]

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.133
What happened here?

01:29:20.333 --> 01:29:22.100
It looks like a catastrophic failure.

01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:24.633
Half the cells are broken and empty.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.067
Some structural failure
must have set them free.

01:29:27.133 --> 01:29:28.600
Opened up Pandora's Box.

01:29:29.733 --> 01:29:30.733
Now what?

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.800
[man 1] Incoming!

01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:35.100
[man 2 screams]

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:40.700
[whimpering]

01:29:48.267 --> 01:29:49.633
Hey!

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.767
Hey, 12 o'clock!

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.933
- [man 1] Do it!
- [man 2] They're coming back!

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
<i>- [man 3] They're moving!
- [man 1 over radio] All eyes on target.</i>

01:30:04.067 --> 01:30:06.767
<i>- One of them is reforming.
- [man 2 over radio] Bring it down!</i>

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.100
[rumbling]

01:30:27.967 --> 01:30:30.133
"Top research advisers
of the central regime."

01:30:31.367 --> 01:30:34.367
This man was trying to stop it.
They did lose control.

01:30:36.233 --> 01:30:37.633
Can you translate this?

01:30:42.867 --> 01:30:44.133
[whirring]

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:47.633
It's an emergency shutdown procedure.
Half these words I've never seen.

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:48.867
What about the other half?

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.733
[screeching]

01:30:57.133 --> 01:30:58.267
[grunting]

01:31:00.733 --> 01:31:03.000
"Decouple... Decouple procedure.

01:31:03.067 --> 01:31:08.200
Disconnect the umbilicals to, uh...
interrupt the... neural activity."

01:31:08.267 --> 01:31:11.667
- Okay.
- So, you gotta unlock all these ports.

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:15.200
And then you gotta pull this bracket here
to release all the cables.

01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.000
And then?

01:31:17.767 --> 01:31:18.900
That should stop them.

01:31:22.367 --> 01:31:24.667
[rumbling]

01:31:26.267 --> 01:31:27.267
Take this.

01:31:38.767 --> 01:31:39.767
[grunts]

01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.867
[powering up]

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:22.133
[beeping]

01:32:29.067 --> 01:32:30.133
[grunts]

01:32:32.367 --> 01:32:34.000
[rumbling]

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.333
Come on! Get up!

01:32:40.767 --> 01:32:42.207
[Alessio] Right there! There's more!

01:32:42.733 --> 01:32:43.600
Another one!

01:32:43.667 --> 01:32:44.700
[grunting]

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:00.167
[grunting]

01:33:06.167 --> 01:33:07.300
[man] Got it right there!

01:33:12.767 --> 01:33:14.733
- Clyne!
- I know!

01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:28.100
[grunts]

01:33:40.633 --> 01:33:41.667
What the hell?

01:33:42.133 --> 01:33:44.200
I did them all. Nothing's happening.

01:33:45.133 --> 01:33:47.733
[cracking]

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:50.733
[whirring]

01:33:51.867 --> 01:33:53.067
[whirring]

01:33:56.067 --> 01:33:56.933
[rumbling]

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.667
[glass cracking]

01:33:58.733 --> 01:34:02.900
Clyne! Pull the bracket! In the middle!

01:34:08.133 --> 01:34:09.933
No! No!

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.033
[beeping]

01:34:27.633 --> 01:34:28.867
[Fran screaming]

01:34:34.233 --> 01:34:35.367
[grunts]

01:35:37.933 --> 01:35:38.933
[Clyne mumbles]

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.833
[Fran panting]

01:35:43.733 --> 01:35:46.067
- Is it over?
- I don't know.

01:36:24.267 --> 01:36:25.300
Can you walk?

01:36:28.167 --> 01:36:29.633
- I'm all right.
- Come on.

01:36:30.233 --> 01:36:31.700
We have to find a way out.

01:36:31.833 --> 01:36:34.100
[whirring]

01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:37.333
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
[Clyne] This is it.

01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:02.600
They weren't just scanning people.

01:37:03.833 --> 01:37:05.033
They're not just printouts.

01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:07.900
This is what's controlling them.

01:37:09.933 --> 01:37:11.334
[Fran] These are from real corpses.

01:37:12.367 --> 01:37:14.633
[Clyne]
Each one is made from a real person.

01:37:16.667 --> 01:37:17.700
They're alive?

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:19.833
They're not alive.

01:37:22.967 --> 01:37:23.967
They're not dead.

01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:29.700
They're just trapped somewhere in between.

01:37:33.367 --> 01:37:34.367
But they are in pain.

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:37.200
How do you know?

01:37:38.267 --> 01:37:39.633
This is pain.

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.267
But how do you know they can feel?

01:37:45.833 --> 01:37:46.867
I can't prove it.

01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:49.700
I can't.

01:37:55.833 --> 01:37:58.033
So, maybe there are things
science can't answer.

01:37:59.867 --> 01:38:00.933
[powering down]

01:38:12.633 --> 01:38:13.633
No.

01:38:14.067 --> 01:38:15.100
Wait, no.

01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:18.167
This is why we came here.

01:38:19.167 --> 01:38:22.100
This is the evidence.
This is why you came, remember?

01:38:23.033 --> 01:38:25.833
Remember?
So many people have died. You said it.

01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:28.233
- You said, "I wanna know why."
- I know enough.

01:38:29.967 --> 01:38:31.967
You have to think about
the bigger picture.

01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:35.900
I am.

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.100
[powering down]

01:39:30.233 --> 01:39:31.700
[man 1] Help them off single file.

01:39:32.867 --> 01:39:33.947
[man 2] Got more coming in!

01:39:34.933 --> 01:39:36.233
[man 3] Put them in Unit 5.

01:39:37.167 --> 01:39:39.327
- [man 4] Over here. Over here.
- [man 5] Watch his neck.

01:39:39.367 --> 01:39:42.200
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

01:39:50.633 --> 01:39:51.674
[man 6] Give me your hand.

01:39:56.133 --> 01:39:57.133
[man 7] Right there, sir.

01:39:57.967 --> 01:39:58.967
[man 8] Welcome back.

01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:01.300
[man 9] You okay?

01:40:18.633 --> 01:40:20.233
[indistinct chattering]

01:40:37.633 --> 01:40:38.633
New survey teams.

01:40:39.067 --> 01:40:41.767
They're gonna take Masarov apart
piece by piece.

01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:43.700
Measure everything.

01:40:45.267 --> 01:40:46.933
Try to reverse-engineer it.

01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:48.967
Fight over ownership.

01:40:50.267 --> 01:40:53.767
I've been asked if you wanna
go back out there. I said I'd ask, but...

01:40:54.833 --> 01:40:56.100
I've seen what I came to see.

01:41:01.933 --> 01:41:03.700
[indistinct chattering]

01:41:14.133 --> 01:41:15.633
They don't stop, do they?

01:41:16.633 --> 01:41:17.900
I don't think they know how.

01:41:34.633 --> 01:41:36.167
[indistinct chattering]

01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:45.300
I told you you'd go home to Virginia
without unpacking.

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:47.700
[man] Delta Unit, move out.

01:41:49.867 --> 01:41:50.987
[speaks in foreign language]

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:52.800
[in English] Thank you.
