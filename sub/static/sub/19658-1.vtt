00:13.532 --> 00:16.430
Got that right, Quill.
Don't know what this thing is,

00:16.455 --> 00:20.135
but people keep putting money in
it, so it's gotta be valuable.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.579
Maybe so, Rocket.
I'm starting to doubt

00:22.604 --> 00:25.802
this is really a ceremonial
Earth warrior headdress.

But this is your home.

00:45.398 --> 00:47.579
Yeah. Not anymore.

Besides, the galaxy

First up, the cosmic seed won't
get back to Asgard by itself.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.633
The longer we keep it here,
the longer my home planet

01:01.658 --> 01:03.725
is a target for bad guys like Thanos.

01:03.750 --> 01:06.305
Who's hopefully gonna spend
the next billion years

01:06.330 --> 01:08.125
digging himself out of

01:08.150 --> 01:10.438
And yet my revenge feels hollow.

01:10.463 --> 01:14.128
What is the purpose of a destroyer

01:15.493 --> 01:16.744
Cheer up, Drax.

01:16.769 --> 01:19.267
Looks like you may have
some purpose left after all.

01:19.292 --> 01:20.269
I am Groot?

01:21.269 --> 01:24.601
Beats me, bud. What is the
big deal about some rock?

01:24.777 --> 01:28.041
According to the energy reading,
this rock is Sanctuary.

01:28.066 --> 01:29.187
Eh?

01:29.690 --> 01:32.310
Thanos's personal asteroid?

01:32.335 --> 01:34.509
Um, seriously? It had a name?

01:34.534 --> 01:38.046
I'd be more concerned that it
moved since we last saw it.

01:38.071 --> 01:41.000
All right. That's it, kids.
I'm turning this ship around.

01:46.550 --> 01:49.361
Approaching target.
Magnify image.

01:49.750 --> 01:52.416
That does not look like an asteroid.

01:52.441 --> 01:55.942
No, but it looks big enough
to hold about ten asteroids.

01:56.175 --> 01:59.186
Any idea what that symbol means?

02:00.466 --> 02:02.835
According to something
called, "The Internet,"

02:02.860 --> 02:05.797
it stands for, "Avengers."

02:06.087 --> 02:08.187
Otherwise known
as some losers

02:08.213 --> 02:11.929

You know
what else you don't have?

02:52.729 --> 02:55.423
Thanos's krutackin' asteroid.

I am Groot.

02:58.097 --> 03:00.397
I know the scanner's
picking up a reading.

03:00.422 --> 03:03.211
From inside that doohickey.

03:04.043 --> 03:07.862
That doohickey is too small
to contain Thanos's asteroid.

03:07.940 --> 03:12.295
Score one for the master of the obvious,
and zero for the rodent's scanner.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.910
My scanner works fine.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.369
And don't call me rodent!

03:15.394 --> 03:17.694
Oh, hey, look.
It was a false alarm.

03:18.060 --> 03:20.307
Let's all relax.

03:24.190 --> 03:27.276
Whoa. Honey, I shrunk
the sanctuary.

03:27.301 --> 03:29.585
Thanos possessed a lot
of powerful artifacts,

03:29.610 --> 03:32.303
but nothing capable of
this kind of mass shifting.

03:34.780 --> 03:36.242
Who cares?

03:37.030 --> 03:38.376
It's ours now.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.256
I do not know my purpose,

03:40.281 --> 03:42.695
but I am certain
it is not to be a thief.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.130
We're only stealing this rock back
from whoever stole it from Thanos,

03:46.155 --> 03:48.447
who probably stole it
in the first place.

03:48.472 --> 03:50.915
More importantly, we're
protecting my planet.

03:50.940 --> 03:54.206
You know, it's not like Earth is
full of mighty heroes like us.

03:54.655 --> 03:56.170
Huh?

03:58.040 --> 04:00.610
Seriously? Guys, mighty?

04:00.635 --> 04:03.307
Hey! Never underestimate
the little guy.

04:03.332 --> 04:06.711
I don't know who you freaks are,
but I know you don't belong here.

04:06.910 --> 04:09.108
I am Groot!

04:16.653 --> 04:21.074
Like the vegetable said, what are
you gonna do about it, puny?

04:26.824 --> 04:28.066
<i>Okay, fun fact,</i>

04:28.091 --> 04:30.320
<i>Earth scientists
do not normally do that.</i>

- Drax will destroy you!

05:00.258 --> 05:03.514
You intruders got
some 'splainin' to do!

05:03.719 --> 05:06.795
- <i>Hey, I know that reference.</i>
- Who gives a flarg?

05:06.950 --> 05:08.396
Ahh!

05:08.421 --> 05:10.996
Put the tree down!

05:16.334 --> 05:18.435
Hang in there, bud.
I got an idea.

05:23.286 --> 05:25.415
Hold still so I can smash you!

05:25.661 --> 05:27.020
Very well.

05:27.050 --> 05:28.730
Ahh!

05:28.918 --> 05:30.813
Come on! Move!

05:31.645 --> 05:35.380
You do not seem to be able
to make up your mind!

05:38.838 --> 05:40.401
You all right, Quill?

05:40.911 --> 05:43.331
No, come on.
I swear I'll call ya.

05:44.976 --> 05:49.825
You ask me, Earth defense tech has
moved way past microwave popcorn.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.896
But your cyber security's
still in the stone age.

06:06.570 --> 06:08.070
Get off!

06:16.530 --> 06:20.093
Ant-Man, Captain Marvel, I wanna thank you
two for lending a hand in this mission.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.373
Happy to whip you
into shape anytime, Cap.

06:22.398 --> 06:25.370
And once Dr. Banner's done
studying that asteroid I shrunk,

06:25.395 --> 06:27.854
we can check out this thing
we just recovered.

06:28.106 --> 06:30.819
Odd. My centurions are online.

06:31.012 --> 06:33.710
It could be trouble, Tony.
We better investigate.

06:38.313 --> 06:40.233
<i>Okay, next time you wanna take out</i>

06:40.258 --> 06:42.102
<i>your aggression on something, big guy,</i>

06:42.127 --> 06:43.817
try a stress ball.

06:44.133 --> 06:47.640
What? I was putting the
smash-down on some intruders.

06:47.670 --> 06:48.773
Uh, doubt it.

06:48.798 --> 06:52.690
With my security upgrades, no
one can break into this place.

06:52.715 --> 06:54.318
You know, except me.

06:54.496 --> 06:56.833
Tell it to the guys that broke in.

06:59.968 --> 07:04.613
But there was a talking raccoon,
and a walking tree, and...

07:04.991 --> 07:08.729
Okay, that sounds nuts
when I say it out loud.

07:09.855 --> 07:11.757
Maybe not.

07:12.761 --> 07:14.479
They took the asteroid!

07:14.863 --> 07:17.502
Fan out. Form a perimeter
and locate the thieves,

07:17.527 --> 07:18.824
whatever they look like.

07:23.460 --> 07:26.040
Left! The other left!

07:26.070 --> 07:28.585
The other other left, bark brain!

07:28.610 --> 07:30.981
I am Groot!

07:35.653 --> 07:38.226
This armor does not appear
as durable as we thought.

07:43.403 --> 07:44.488
Uh-oh.

07:44.513 --> 07:46.526
<i>I think we found our intruders.</i>

07:46.551 --> 07:48.054
Told ya!

07:50.980 --> 07:52.240
Whoa!

07:52.270 --> 07:53.455
Ow!

07:56.411 --> 08:00.761
Now let's smash some alien thieves.

08:01.005 --> 08:03.564
Um, actually, we were just leaving.

08:10.940 --> 08:13.253
You thieves ain't going nowhere.

08:13.431 --> 08:16.539
We were trying to protect
your krutackin' planet!

08:19.334 --> 08:22.178
Uh, yeah? By stealing our stuff?

08:22.203 --> 08:23.476
It's not yours.

08:23.501 --> 08:26.489
You Terrans can't be trusted
with Sanctuary's power.

08:26.719 --> 08:27.423
Ahh!

08:27.448 --> 08:30.783
Then put down the rock and your
weapons, and we can discuss this.

08:31.378 --> 08:34.254
Yeah, we could do that.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.251
Or we could just leave
with what we came for!

08:36.277 --> 08:38.385
Afraid we can't let you do that.

08:39.712 --> 08:40.916
Ahh!

08:41.986 --> 08:45.759
Face it. You'll never lay
an oversized green finger on me.

08:45.784 --> 08:49.369
Well, you'll never lay
a puny green finger on me!

08:51.964 --> 08:53.857
Fortunately, I don't have to.

08:55.009 --> 08:58.607
- I will not fight an unarmed opponent.
- Fine with me.

09:02.520 --> 09:05.344
Seriously? What's up with
the Captain America get-up?

09:07.223 --> 09:09.078
I'm Captain America.

09:09.297 --> 09:12.765
Yeah. You fought in World War
II, and you're 100 years old.

09:12.790 --> 09:14.207
I was frozen in ice.

09:14.870 --> 09:16.828
Oh. You mean like this?

09:19.321 --> 09:21.470
I've faced deadlier armor.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.680
Heck, I've worn
deadlier armor, tin man.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.806
<i>That's, "Iron Man."</i>

09:27.358 --> 09:29.186
<i>And this suit is impervious
to any missile,</i>

09:29.211 --> 09:31.671
<i>bomb, or plasma blast
you can throw at me.</i>

09:31.996 --> 09:34.582
How about a magnet, Iron Man?

09:34.607 --> 09:36.493
<i>Hey, no!</i>

09:40.770 --> 09:42.827
I am Groot.

09:43.184 --> 09:45.240
Well, don't just
stand there! Fight!

09:45.280 --> 09:46.889
I am Groot!

09:46.914 --> 09:49.400
What do you mean
you're already fighting?

09:49.686 --> 09:52.598
Forward, troops!
Free the asteroid!

09:53.600 --> 09:56.209
Let's go while we still
have an exit option.

09:56.234 --> 09:58.497
I am Groot!

10:09.884 --> 10:13.507
Ha-ha! Try blasting
us now, suckers!

10:13.691 --> 10:17.800
Uh, Quill, it's a tractor
beam, not a force field.

10:23.141 --> 10:25.262
I am Groot!

10:31.190 --> 10:32.609
That's not good.

10:36.490 --> 10:38.115
Hang on, Tony.

10:45.894 --> 10:47.120
What was that?

10:47.145 --> 10:50.159
If I had to guess,
something big and green.

10:55.347 --> 10:57.274
Aw, can't we go any faster?

10:58.543 --> 11:01.011
Hang on. I'm diverting
all power to the engines.

11:01.551 --> 11:02.659
Divert it quickly!

11:16.250 --> 11:18.395
Apparently, it's raining
Avengers today.

11:18.537 --> 11:21.312
Fire up the jet.
They are not getting away.

11:21.337 --> 11:23.119
I got this, Tony.

11:24.295 --> 11:26.776
I am Groot!

11:29.818 --> 11:32.375
Is that rock growing?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.923
<i>Yo, Earth monkeys!</i>

11:33.948 --> 11:36.275
<i>Stop messing with
my krutackin' asteroid!</i>

11:36.300 --> 11:37.740
"Earth monkeys"?

11:37.770 --> 11:41.386
You know, you should've thought of
that before you invaded our planet.

11:41.581 --> 11:44.558
Hey, I'm from here, too, and I'm
trying to protect our planet

11:44.599 --> 11:47.187
by keeping dangerous stuff
like this off of it.

11:47.310 --> 11:51.247
<i>I'm already late to return a nasty
Cosmic Seed thingy to a dude named Thor.</i>

11:51.272 --> 11:54.755
- Wait. You know Thor?
- <i>Flarg, yeah!</i>

11:54.780 --> 11:56.865
Didn't he ever mention
the Guardians of the Galaxy,

11:56.890 --> 11:58.550
led by the legendary Star-Lord?

11:58.580 --> 11:59.966
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

11:59.991 --> 12:02.120
<i>he did say something
about a band of misfits,</i>

12:02.145 --> 12:04.789
<i>led by the buffoonish Peter Quill.</i>

12:05.028 --> 12:06.645
Yes, that is him.

12:06.670 --> 12:08.777
He is the buffoonish Peter Quill.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.104
So, wait.
We're on the same side?

12:12.129 --> 12:15.647
Okay, stay calm. I'm shrinking it
now with my Pym Particle Disk.

12:16.199 --> 12:18.418
You mean this gizmo
that just got crushed?

12:22.129 --> 12:24.154
<i>Get it out,
get it out, get it out!</i>

12:33.759 --> 12:34.917
Incoming!

12:36.004 --> 12:37.300
I got this!

12:45.340 --> 12:47.590
I told you, I got this!

12:48.460 --> 12:49.460
Oh!

12:52.178 --> 12:53.731
Oh, crud.

13:12.359 --> 13:16.443
You krutackin' Avengers owe me a
lifetime supply of duct tape!

13:17.191 --> 13:20.644
So, Thor never told you
about the Avengers?

13:20.669 --> 13:23.390
No. But I approve of the name.

13:23.415 --> 13:25.655
I live for vengeance.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.025
Yeah, that's not exactly
what this team's all about.

13:28.050 --> 13:31.850
<i>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but
the asteroid hit our main security hub.</i>

13:31.875 --> 13:34.463
The system still thinks
we're under attack...

13:36.259 --> 13:39.080
And initiated
the fail-safe protocols.

13:39.105 --> 13:41.904
What kind of fail-safe protocols?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.884
<i>The kind that... I don't know...
Involve satellites</i>

13:44.909 --> 13:47.089
<i>and incredibly powerful laser beams.</i>

13:49.830 --> 13:52.069
<i>You know, that kind of protocol.</i>

14:03.997 --> 14:05.362
<i>That's not good.</i>

14:06.376 --> 14:08.484
Yeah, we're flarged.

14:11.020 --> 14:12.070
<i>We need
a plan to deal with that</i>

14:12.090 --> 14:14.172
<i>out-of-control
defense satellite.</i>

14:14.197 --> 14:16.081
I'm gonna go with run!

14:22.200 --> 14:24.716
I am Groot!

14:28.980 --> 14:32.790
What kind of fail-safe system did
you so-called heroes slap together?

14:32.820 --> 14:35.480
One that will rain vengeance!

14:35.505 --> 14:38.898
<i>Actually, it's meant to protect
Earth by stopping hostiles</i>

14:38.923 --> 14:40.918
<i>from getting their hands on our tech.</i>

14:41.057 --> 14:44.534
The only thing Earth needs
protecting from is you guys!

14:44.630 --> 14:47.880
Hey, we're not the ones who dropped
an asteroid on our headquarters.

14:47.905 --> 14:51.793
No, you're just the ones who messed
with its size and forced us to.

14:51.818 --> 14:55.425
'Cause you space freaks ripped
off the rock in the first place!

14:55.450 --> 14:57.206
I am Groot!

14:57.231 --> 14:59.564
Watch where you're sticking
those branches, shrub.

14:59.589 --> 15:02.065
Everyone stand down.
The beam is still active,

15:02.090 --> 15:04.040
and it's heading for a populated area!

15:04.070 --> 15:06.087
This is all your fault!

15:06.210 --> 15:08.690
Wait. I just got
locked out of the system.

15:08.730 --> 15:11.410
I can't access
the satellite's computer.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.044
Which means someone else is
tampering with it. But who?

15:14.069 --> 15:15.419
Questions will have to wait.

15:15.444 --> 15:18.095
Hulk and Iron Man, we need to deflect
the beam away from the town.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.467
Gamora and Drax, you'll
help me evacuate citizens.

15:20.492 --> 15:23.432
Marvel and Ant-Man, your mission is
to disable the satellite with...

15:23.806 --> 15:25.850
Wait. Where are they going?
They don't even know the plan.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.815
That's never stopped Quill before.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.423
What do you say we go after them
and explain it, Carol?

15:32.277 --> 15:34.445
Don't worry. I've got this.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.992
Why didn't they tell us the
satellite had an energy shield?

15:52.260 --> 15:53.917
Hey, space cowboy.

15:54.313 --> 15:56.910
Probably should've listened
to Cap's whole plan.

15:56.935 --> 15:58.865
I don't take orders. I give 'em.

15:58.930 --> 16:00.886
Not that anyone listens to 'em.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.395
So how do we get past the shields?

16:03.420 --> 16:04.974
I know a guy.

16:12.730 --> 16:15.131
<i>My repulsor shield
should weaken the beam.</i>

16:21.023 --> 16:23.739
If the beam doesn't fry
my suit's circuitry first.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.929
It still packs a pretty good punch!

16:54.203 --> 16:55.758
Flee, tiny humans.

16:55.783 --> 16:58.142
Flee from the vengeance
of the Avengers!

16:58.753 --> 17:01.358
Their capacity for
destruction is unparalleled.

17:01.383 --> 17:03.494
None shall escape their wrath.

17:05.683 --> 17:08.383
Our job is to protect and
reassure the civilians, Drax,

17:08.407 --> 17:10.021
not frighten them out of their wits.

17:15.878 --> 17:18.726
Nice to take orders from someone who
actually knows what he's doing.

17:18.751 --> 17:20.345
This is not vengeance.

17:20.369 --> 17:22.768
Should you not call
yourselves the Guardians?

17:24.098 --> 17:26.108
I think that name's already taken.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.960
<i>You sure you can
get us around that shield?</i>

17:34.985 --> 17:37.825
<i>Well, not around,
but through-ish.</i>

17:37.850 --> 17:41.390
<i>As in, between the molecules.</i>

17:42.000 --> 17:43.198
<i>Wait. Between the...</i>

17:43.223 --> 17:45.287
<i>Whoa! We're so little!</i>

17:45.312 --> 17:47.021
<i>Whoa!</i>

17:56.373 --> 17:58.210
<i>Oh! Nice!</i>

17:58.420 --> 18:00.604
<i>Way smoother than those other Avengers.</i>

18:00.629 --> 18:03.846
<i>Now, do I detect the rugged
individualism of a fellow outlaw?</i>

18:04.535 --> 18:05.500
Former.

18:05.562 --> 18:08.824
Captain America helped me
put that life behind me.

18:08.842 --> 18:10.620
I guess he's kind of a father figure.

18:10.653 --> 18:13.094
Or grandfather figure.

18:13.119 --> 18:15.450
<i>Yeah, I don't do
so well with father figures.</i>

18:15.486 --> 18:16.701
<i>You got a lock pick?</i>

18:18.407 --> 18:20.215
I am a lock pick.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.970
<i>Once an outlaw,
always an outlaw.</i>

18:25.000 --> 18:27.478
Only if it's for a good cause.

18:27.593 --> 18:29.106
Tony was right.

18:29.131 --> 18:31.691
Someone else has been
tampering with the system.

18:31.805 --> 18:35.051
<i>It's definitely alien tech,
but nothing I've ever seen.</i>

18:37.770 --> 18:38.840
Looks like they diverted

18:38.860 --> 18:40.852
the satellite beam away from the Earth.

18:40.877 --> 18:43.292
Yeah, and straight at us!

18:43.427 --> 18:45.028
I am Groot!

18:49.600 --> 18:53.213
Move over, tree.
Let a real pilot take over.

18:53.238 --> 18:57.382
These are sensitive controls. Ain't
like any idiot can fly this thing.

18:57.425 --> 18:58.650
Quill can.

18:59.443 --> 19:01.107
Eh, point taken.

19:01.345 --> 19:02.924
<i>Proximity alert.</i>

19:04.332 --> 19:06.561
That is one big...

19:07.267 --> 19:08.781
Oh, flarg.

19:14.047 --> 19:15.340
I can't shut it down,

19:15.380 --> 19:17.465
but I think I can short it out.

19:19.090 --> 19:22.612
Oh, man! My 3,698 songs!

19:22.637 --> 19:24.365
I saw your playlist.

19:24.390 --> 19:26.639
Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.

19:28.080 --> 19:32.302
If I have to sacrifice my '80s synthpop
collection, I'm doing it myself.

19:32.327 --> 19:34.272
A-ha! Little again!

19:55.108 --> 19:57.547
<i>All right. Listen up,
Avengers and Guardians.</i>

19:57.572 --> 20:00.310
<i>We're the only thing standing
between that beam and this town,</i>

20:00.350 --> 20:02.428
<i>and we're not going down
without a fight.</i>

20:13.030 --> 20:14.927
<i>Ten seconds to impact.</i>

20:15.210 --> 20:17.107
<i>Repulsor shield at maximum!</i>

20:19.757 --> 20:22.632
<i>Brace for impact in five, four,</i>

20:22.657 --> 20:24.716
<i>three, two...</i>

20:25.550 --> 20:26.796
<i>Wait. What?</i>

20:28.730 --> 20:31.790
Well, guess we owe the buffoonish
Peter Quill a thank-you.

20:35.553 --> 20:37.736
Uh, Quill?

20:43.112 --> 20:44.920
Score one for team outlaw.

20:44.940 --> 20:46.162
<i>Well done.</i>

20:46.187 --> 20:49.236
Today, you space thieves
can call yourselves Avengers.

20:49.253 --> 20:50.810
We have avenged nothing.

20:51.146 --> 20:54.592
Today, you can call
yourselves Guardians.

20:57.537 --> 20:59.812
Nice job.

20:59.837 --> 21:02.795
Think us Terrans can be trusted
to examine this thing?

21:02.820 --> 21:06.465
Relax. I'm a Terran too. Well,
actually I'm half-Terran.

21:06.490 --> 21:08.180
Hey, Rocket, can we thumb a ride?

21:08.763 --> 21:09.806
<i>Rocket?</i>

21:10.490 --> 21:11.638
<i>Groot?</i>

21:12.230 --> 21:13.418
<i>Anybody?</i>

21:14.063 --> 21:15.705
They're not answering.

21:15.730 --> 21:18.667
Uh, looks like we got bigger problems.

21:18.723 --> 21:19.972
Like gravity.

21:19.997 --> 21:21.683
Rocket, get over here!

21:21.708 --> 21:24.614
We got 99 miles until we're pancakes!

21:24.639 --> 21:26.530
Rocket!
