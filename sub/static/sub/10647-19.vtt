WEBVTT

00:03.550 --> 00:05.470
Spidey here. And Miles Morales.

00:05.555 --> 00:07.298
The Spider-Man of
an alternate dimension and I

00:07.329 --> 00:09.321
have been hopping from
one universe to another,

00:09.384 --> 00:10.993
grabbing the pieces
of a mystical gem

00:11.040 --> 00:12.173
<i>called the Siege Perilous,</i>

00:12.237 --> 00:13.571
<i>before they cause
all the dimensions</i>

00:13.634 --> 00:15.001
<i>to crash into one another.</i>

00:15.063 --> 00:16.337
<i>And we're not alone.</i>

00:16.404 --> 00:17.985
<i>This guy named Wolf Spider,</i>

00:18.063 --> 00:19.805
<i>who's about as friendly
as he sounds,</i>

00:19.868 --> 00:21.634
<i>is collecting shards himself.</i>

00:21.704 --> 00:24.196
<i>And I doubt
it's for anything good.</i>

00:24.282 --> 00:27.251
Who knows what's next,
a universe of monsters?

00:27.337 --> 00:28.602
Of clowns?

00:28.683 --> 00:30.938
A realm of monsters
that are clowns?

00:35.690 --> 00:37.756
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

00:41.204 --> 00:43.470
(BOTH GRUNTING)

00:43.597 --> 00:44.821
What world is this?

00:44.899 --> 00:46.632
Not the clown monster one,
right?

00:46.667 --> 00:48.282
That couldn't be a real thing.
Could it?

00:48.352 --> 00:50.470
MILES: Wait. This is my street.

00:50.579 --> 00:53.798
SPIDER-MAN: No vampires, aliens
or old-timey gangsters in sight!

00:53.915 --> 00:55.438
It's possible this is
your New York!

00:55.540 --> 00:57.134
I'm on my home turf?

00:57.251 --> 00:59.024
I finally get to see my mom!

00:59.126 --> 01:01.321
Everything's comin' up Miles!

01:01.438 --> 01:03.649
I bet this world's missed
having a Spider-Man.

01:03.696 --> 01:05.970
We'll be treated like
returning heroes!

01:06.087 --> 01:07.970
There might be parades!
(TIRES SCREECHING)

01:08.102 --> 01:09.665
Huh? Or not.

01:09.743 --> 01:12.624
MILES: You leave your own dimension
for how long and everything changes?

01:12.725 --> 01:15.522
Is that a Spider-Woman,
and is she leading the police?

01:15.608 --> 01:18.366
I never got to do that.
She's not leading.

01:18.436 --> 01:19.889
The police are chasing her!

01:19.983 --> 01:22.233
We got a Spider-Thief
on our hands!

01:24.413 --> 01:25.647
(GRUNTS)

01:30.381 --> 01:32.889
Stop! In the name of...
Peter Parker?

01:33.053 --> 01:34.506
Miles Morales?

01:34.569 --> 01:37.303
What? Do we know you? Nope.

01:37.420 --> 01:39.585
The Spiders we know
don't rob banks.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.499
Huh? Oh, no, no, no.
My name is Gwen.

01:42.590 --> 01:45.303
(GRUNTS) And I'm trying to
be a hero, like you two.

01:45.405 --> 01:48.566
I stopped a robbery, and I just haven't
had a chance to return the money yet.

01:49.389 --> 01:50.491
SPIDER-MAN: Here's your chance.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.186
Just turn the cash over
and tell the truth.

01:52.303 --> 01:53.952
It'll be no problem.
Police love me!

01:54.077 --> 01:56.502
CAPTAIN STACEY: <i>Freeze!
This is Captain Stacey</i>

01:56.537 --> 01:58.483
<i>of the New York
Police Department!</i>

01:58.572 --> 02:01.530
<i>You costumed vigilantes
are under arrest!</i>

02:01.642 --> 02:05.131
<i>Stand down or we'll be
forced to use the backup!</i>

02:06.991 --> 02:08.639
SPIDER-MAN:
"Returning heroes," huh?

02:08.818 --> 02:11.272
They did not have those
robot things when I left!

02:11.358 --> 02:13.741
It's worse than you think.
That police captain?

02:13.811 --> 02:16.053
He's sort of totally my dad.

02:16.163 --> 02:18.124
CAPTAIN STACEY:
(OVER PA) <i>Engage!</i>

02:18.282 --> 02:20.639
Oh, great. Family drama!

Wait... Ah!

02:37.148 --> 02:39.015
(GRUNTING) Stop!

02:39.484 --> 02:42.250
We're the good guys.
We don't want to fight you.

02:42.366 --> 02:43.432
(SCREAMS)

02:43.536 --> 02:45.500
We don't want to get
blasted, either!

02:50.796 --> 02:53.726
No offense, but your dad
is pretty hardcore! Whoa!

02:53.882 --> 02:55.539
(GRUNTS) Not his fault!

02:55.640 --> 02:57.492
Ever since that
Spider-Man disappeared,

02:57.539 --> 02:59.046
the criminals
have gotten bolder.

02:59.140 --> 03:01.117
Some of them masquerading
as good guys.

03:01.218 --> 03:03.418
The police had to respond.

03:03.703 --> 03:07.546
Vigilantes, crooks,
two sides of the same coin.

03:07.656 --> 03:11.828
As long as you hide behind
masks, no one is above the law!

03:12.078 --> 03:13.742
A weak point where?

03:14.007 --> 03:15.242
Who are you talking to?

03:15.281 --> 03:17.882
Yank out the compartment at
the base of the robots' necks.

03:17.946 --> 03:19.296
I see them.

03:20.702 --> 03:22.302
(GRUNTS)

03:24.523 --> 03:26.208
(GROANS)

03:26.310 --> 03:28.724
Now, a little web fluid
should gum up the works!

03:29.998 --> 03:32.208
That's actually a brilliant
way to use web fluid.

03:32.294 --> 03:33.380
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

03:33.421 --> 03:36.537
That's... That's destruction
of police property!

03:37.388 --> 03:39.154
Block off the alley!

03:39.189 --> 03:40.490
(GRUNTING)

03:42.635 --> 03:44.168
No!

03:50.235 --> 03:51.564
Spider-Woman!

03:51.696 --> 03:53.306
I am so tired of this.

03:55.780 --> 03:58.681
So, this is my world, right?

03:58.817 --> 04:01.235
It is! And it's really good
to have you back.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.696
I was friends with
a Peter Parker here...

04:03.879 --> 04:05.126
The one who died.

04:06.173 --> 04:07.923
But you and I have never met.

04:08.017 --> 04:09.384
Miles, I found out who you were

04:09.446 --> 04:12.071
through some intense
investigation.

04:12.173 --> 04:15.376
And when you disappeared, I couldn't
just stand on the sidelines.

04:15.525 --> 04:17.548
The world needs a Spider.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.430
So, web shooters,
digital spider-sense,

04:21.531 --> 04:23.821
gloves and boots
with magnetic grips!

04:23.939 --> 04:26.845
You created tech-based
spider powers for yourself?

04:26.954 --> 04:29.103
Well, I had a little help.

04:29.228 --> 04:32.897
And some borrowed equipment from
my dad's robotic police program.

04:33.022 --> 04:36.272
Which is another reason why I
can't tell him what I'm doing.

04:36.380 --> 04:38.162
You're afraid your dad
wouldn't approve.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.717
Yeah.

04:39.834 --> 04:43.018
I mean, despite that, he's
actually a really cool dad.

04:43.631 --> 04:44.908
Here's the entrance.

04:51.064 --> 04:53.064
Welcome to the Spider's Nest.

04:53.154 --> 04:55.255
MILES: I need one of these.

04:55.399 --> 04:57.541
These touches look
kind of familiar.

05:03.627 --> 05:07.236
You wanted to know who I was
talking to on my ear bud...

05:09.197 --> 05:10.666
Aunt May?

05:10.744 --> 05:12.447
You're him, aren't you?

05:12.580 --> 05:14.314
Peter, from the other dimension.

05:14.385 --> 05:17.392
Gwen told me she saw you
and Miles working together.

05:18.236 --> 05:19.767
I am.

05:19.897 --> 05:22.697
(SIGHS) It's great
to see that face again.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.619
I lost my Peter,
but it's good to know

05:25.728 --> 05:27.705
there's another one
still out there.

05:27.807 --> 05:29.369
So, you help Gwen?

05:29.433 --> 05:32.064
When Miles disappeared,
she came to me for help.

05:32.158 --> 05:34.436
She was pretty determined.

05:34.682 --> 05:36.502
Figured who better
to run Mission Support

05:36.557 --> 05:38.340
than the original
Spider-Man's aunt?

05:38.416 --> 05:40.478
I can see
the whole city from here.

05:40.564 --> 05:44.189
Satellite mapping,
tracking and identification.

05:44.314 --> 05:46.135
Maybe if I helped out my Peter,

05:46.216 --> 05:47.416
he'd still be alive.

05:47.478 --> 05:50.892
All this tech, you can
make a phone call, right?

05:51.002 --> 05:54.057
Let me guess. You want
to call your mom, Rio?

05:55.057 --> 05:56.425
(CHUCKLES) Dialing now.

05:56.460 --> 05:59.002
You know my mom? Of course!

05:59.150 --> 06:02.385
We needed to know who was
walking in my Peter's shoes.

06:02.549 --> 06:05.434
I'm not getting an answer
from Rio's phone.

06:05.885 --> 06:07.588
SPIDER-MAN:
We'll get you home soon.

06:07.830 --> 06:09.541
Let's focus on
the mission for now.

06:09.689 --> 06:11.807
Mission? What mission?

06:13.310 --> 06:16.588
MILES: Okay, maybe you didn't hear
me the first five times I said it,

06:16.713 --> 06:18.447
but there's no way
this plan will work!

06:18.557 --> 06:20.348
Of course it will.
We just have to trust

06:20.384 --> 06:21.885
May and Gwen know
what they're doing.

06:21.978 --> 06:25.020
I can't believe she traced
the Siege Perilous shard

06:25.055 --> 06:26.845
that you're looking for
to my dad's police station.

06:26.931 --> 06:28.509
What are the odds, really?

06:28.610 --> 06:30.938
Trust me, if you knew
the adventures we've been on,

06:31.048 --> 06:34.188
this would be, like,
the least crazy thing.

06:34.282 --> 06:35.563
Let's give it a shot.

06:35.634 --> 06:38.954
No excuses! I need you to
find me that Spider-Woman

06:39.015 --> 06:40.548
unsub before...

06:42.407 --> 06:44.579
I gotta go. Get me results!

06:44.712 --> 06:46.821
Hey, Gwenny Bear,
whatcha doin' here?

06:46.985 --> 06:50.110
I made cookies. Some of
them are not even burnt.

06:50.204 --> 06:51.548
(CHUCKLES)

06:51.649 --> 06:54.728
I'm sure they're perfect.
It's been a madhouse here.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.821
Yeah? Solving crimes?
Puttin' away perps?

06:57.946 --> 06:59.634
(CHUCKLES) I wish.

06:59.735 --> 07:02.306
We spotted two more
costumed vigilantes today.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.220
Dressed like the old Spider-Men.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.294
We've got to find 'em. Stop 'em!

07:06.360 --> 07:08.454
Do you ever think that maybe

07:08.571 --> 07:10.563
they might be doing
some good, Dad?

07:10.649 --> 07:13.813
Just because they have powers
doesn't make them above the law.

07:13.884 --> 07:16.478
They wear masks,
they're hiding something.

07:16.579 --> 07:19.063
Hmm. Good point.

07:19.204 --> 07:21.923
Yeah. Just seeing you is a reminder
of what we're fightin' for.

07:22.055 --> 07:24.188
The honest people of the city.

07:25.016 --> 07:26.587
Yep. Honest.

07:30.296 --> 07:31.373
MAY: (OVER COMMUNICATOR)
<i>She did it.</i>

07:31.421 --> 07:33.282
<i>Spider-Woman installed
the interception device.</i>

07:33.360 --> 07:36.103
<i>Accessing security now.</i>

07:36.274 --> 07:38.704
It's clear, Spider Nest.
Going in.

07:43.415 --> 07:45.360
MAY: <i>Looks like you're headed
for the evidence room.</i>

07:45.493 --> 07:48.095
<i>Avoid the ground level
motion detectors coming up.</i>

07:48.259 --> 07:49.673
Who needs the ground?

07:51.524 --> 07:53.290
The Spiders have landed.

07:55.757 --> 07:57.845
And... Got it!

08:01.956 --> 08:03.985
Yes! (WOMAN WHIMPERING)

08:04.109 --> 08:05.775
That can't be good.

08:06.952 --> 08:09.052
Thanks for gathering
the fragments for me.

08:09.243 --> 08:10.587
I'll take them now.

08:10.673 --> 08:13.509
Wolf Spider? Like we're just
going to hand them over?

08:13.688 --> 08:17.332
Oh, did I fail to mention? I have
a bit of leverage. (WHIMPERING)

08:17.498 --> 08:20.235
Mom! (EVIL LAUGHTER)

08:20.332 --> 08:21.810
Let her go!

08:24.892 --> 08:26.758
(MUFFLED GROANING)

08:27.193 --> 08:28.701
How'd he find your mom?

08:28.748 --> 08:31.013
Don't know, but I won't
let him hurt her!

08:31.098 --> 08:32.951
What matters to you more, Miles?

08:33.020 --> 08:36.053
The Siege Perilous,
or your own mother?

08:36.115 --> 08:37.513
I... MAY: (OVER COMMUNICATOR)
<i>Don't give up yet.</i>

08:37.559 --> 08:39.865
<i>There's a power generator,
three o'clock position.</i>

08:39.996 --> 08:42.865
<i>You have Taser webs, don't you?</i>
Let's do it!

08:42.962 --> 08:44.709
(GRUNTING)

08:45.164 --> 08:47.623
WOLF SPIDER:
What are you...(SCREAMS)

08:47.800 --> 08:49.521
(RUMBLING) What on Earth?

08:49.678 --> 08:51.428
Some kind of explosion
in the basement.

08:51.506 --> 08:53.974
You stay here. Don't move.
(DEVICE BEEPING)

08:54.060 --> 08:55.726
Wouldn't dare, Dad.

09:02.613 --> 09:05.043
Miles! You came back.

09:05.199 --> 09:07.433
So great to see you, Mom.

09:07.607 --> 09:10.589
But I was hoping for a little
smoother of a reunion.

09:10.700 --> 09:13.363
He phoned me at work. Who is he?

09:13.469 --> 09:16.011
We don't know. Except he's
managed to be a pain in our butt

09:16.085 --> 09:18.152
in more than one dimension.
Huh? What?

09:18.212 --> 09:20.078
(GROWLING)

09:21.753 --> 09:24.472
Give me the Siege. (GRUNTING)

09:24.587 --> 09:27.378
Whoa! Spider Arms? Where do
you shop for your shirts?

09:28.696 --> 09:29.949
(BOTH GRUNTING)

09:30.110 --> 09:31.308
Freeze!

09:34.946 --> 09:36.191
(GRUNTS)

09:37.843 --> 09:41.144
Now, where were we?

09:41.336 --> 09:43.410
We were about to
give the smackdown!

09:44.027 --> 09:45.746
(GROANS)

09:45.786 --> 09:47.363
Glowing? Why?

09:47.530 --> 09:49.339
You think you're the only ones

09:49.428 --> 09:51.902
using a shard of
the Siege Perilous?

09:52.156 --> 09:54.636
A piece fell into
my dimension too.

09:54.786 --> 09:57.246
How do you think
I've been following you two?

09:57.424 --> 09:59.502
Why don't you just like our
fan pages like everyone else?

09:59.636 --> 10:00.936
(GRUNTING)

10:04.580 --> 10:05.880
Huh?

10:06.126 --> 10:07.300
(GRUNTS) Hey!

10:07.481 --> 10:09.691
Enough! You don't
need to be alive

10:09.747 --> 10:11.636
for me to take what's mine!

10:11.759 --> 10:14.493
SPIDER-GWEN: Hey! (GRUNTS)

10:15.574 --> 10:17.269
Let's go! (SCREAMS)

10:27.757 --> 10:29.277

10:30.533 --> 10:33.027
Only one spider
will survive this.

10:34.387 --> 10:35.920
Me!

10:40.684 --> 10:41.902
(IN NORMAL VOICE) You look like...
(CLEARS THROAT)

10:41.929 --> 10:44.964
(IN DEEPER VOICE) You look like
you could use some help, officer.

10:45.461 --> 10:47.527
(GRUNTING)

10:47.644 --> 10:51.847
Now, Spider-Runt,
this game is over!

10:52.117 --> 10:54.452
He doesn't have the shard!
(GRUNTS)

10:54.531 --> 10:55.819
Guess who does?

10:57.229 --> 10:59.897
Ah, no!

11:00.211 --> 11:01.694
(GROANS)

11:05.693 --> 11:07.538
SPIDER-MAN: The Siege Perilous
is complete.

11:07.672 --> 11:10.436
He had the rest of it!
We totally did it!

11:10.511 --> 11:13.358
Is this what being
Spider-Man is really like?

11:13.498 --> 11:16.545
Almost every day.
It's kind of exciting.

11:16.722 --> 11:18.282
CAPTAIN STACEY:
You're all under arrest!

11:18.517 --> 11:19.827
And that's our cue.

11:19.897 --> 11:21.491
MAY: (OVER COMMUNICATOR)
<i>Follow the east blast-hole,</i>

11:21.514 --> 11:23.006
<i>that's how Wolf Spider
made it in.</i>

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:33.060 --> 11:35.828
At least we can put
this one behind bars.

11:37.801 --> 11:39.570
(GROANS)

11:40.010 --> 11:41.874
MILES: I missed you,
couch pillow.

11:41.963 --> 11:46.070
Stack of old magazines...
Oh! TV remote!

11:46.531 --> 11:48.523
The memories we have!

11:48.643 --> 11:50.499
I never thought
I'd be here again.

11:50.587 --> 11:53.796
(GROANS) You can just walk through
here in your Spider-Man costume.

11:53.921 --> 11:57.523
No big deal. Whatevs. You don't have
to sneak through the basement window.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.335
I hid my identity
from Aunt May for years.

12:00.407 --> 12:02.062
I thought she'd be
so mad when she found out,

12:02.087 --> 12:04.031
but... she was only proud of me.

12:04.426 --> 12:05.851
Parents can surprise you.

12:06.004 --> 12:07.796
You saved your birthday cake?

12:07.880 --> 12:09.947
I wasn't gonna eat it alone.

12:10.117 --> 12:13.304
I froze it. I knew
you'd make it back.

12:13.484 --> 12:15.804
Guess, uh, this is it.

12:15.966 --> 12:18.757
Could you tell the Web
Warriors "so long" for me?

12:18.929 --> 12:20.624
We're gonna miss having
our kid brother.

12:20.723 --> 12:22.109
Web Warriors?

12:22.241 --> 12:24.788
That's some friends of mine
in the other dimension.

12:24.929 --> 12:27.429
They've been kind
of like a family.

12:30.415 --> 12:32.124
(WICKED LAUGHTER)

12:32.320 --> 12:34.523
You! How do you know
where I live?

12:34.583 --> 12:36.952
Do you really think
you're unique?

12:37.100 --> 12:39.934
My world had
a Miles Morales too.

12:40.016 --> 12:42.406
And your life will
end as his did,

12:42.503 --> 12:46.472
in pain and misery, by my hand!

12:46.952 --> 12:48.070
(SHOUTS) (GRUNTS)

12:48.140 --> 12:49.882
SPIDER-MAN: I don't care
who you think you are,

12:49.984 --> 12:51.632
attacking a spider
in their own home?

12:51.684 --> 12:53.650
Big mistake, Wolfie!

12:53.890 --> 12:57.925
Oh, I think you care
very much who I am, actually.

12:58.133 --> 13:03.437
In every universe, Peter Parker stands
for heroism, and responsibility.

13:03.653 --> 13:06.882
Except for one.
(SINISTER LAUGHTER)

13:06.936 --> 13:07.984
No.

13:08.093 --> 13:10.859
In my world,
the name Peter Parker

13:10.911 --> 13:13.898
puts fear in the hearts
of everyone who hears it.

13:14.077 --> 13:16.593
"Heroism," and "responsibility"?

13:16.691 --> 13:20.687
I destroyed every fool
who held such pathetic ideals!

13:20.787 --> 13:24.088
(GROANS) Until this
shard came to my world,

13:24.210 --> 13:26.913
I thought I was
the only Peter Parker!

13:27.023 --> 13:30.898
And now, with the power of
the complete Siege Perilous,

13:31.007 --> 13:32.964
I will be.

13:40.578 --> 13:43.846
Why would he steal the Siege
but leave us alive?

13:44.133 --> 13:47.167
He's luring us. It's a trap!

13:47.437 --> 13:51.202
And let me guess, we're gonna
follow him right into it.

13:51.490 --> 13:53.976
Of course we are.
Okay, Web Warriors.

13:54.109 --> 13:57.382
This is our last chance. If
we can't stop Wolf Spider,

13:57.488 --> 13:59.296
it's the end of all reality!

14:03.649 --> 14:05.531
SPIDER-MAN:
Even though ion of me,

14:05.590 --> 14:07.093
it's pretty considerate
of him to leave

14:07.140 --> 14:09.140
such a nice path
of destruction to follow.

14:09.229 --> 14:10.531
SPIDER-GWEN: He knows
we're trailing him.

14:10.624 --> 14:12.312
If you guys think
you're prepared to face him,

14:12.386 --> 14:14.109
I'm trusting that you're right.

14:14.239 --> 14:16.781
MILES: We never said anything
about being prepared for this.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.577
SPIDER-MAN:
Hidden underground lair?

14:36.726 --> 14:38.788
Yeah, if I was an
evil version of myself,

14:38.852 --> 14:40.656
I'd probably hide here too.

14:46.379 --> 14:48.346
I'm guessing he's in there.

14:52.846 --> 14:55.547
(BATS SHRIEKING)
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

14:56.435 --> 14:58.366
(EVIL LAUGHTER)

14:58.471 --> 15:01.438
All the Spider life-forces,

15:01.624 --> 15:04.382
better than I could have
possibly dreamed!

15:04.591 --> 15:06.691
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

15:11.598 --> 15:12.946
(GRUNTING)

15:19.224 --> 15:22.298
Hey! Didn't anyone ever
teach you "Sharing is caring"?

15:22.702 --> 15:24.446
(GRUNTING)

15:24.512 --> 15:25.829
(LAUGHS)

15:25.923 --> 15:29.298
I knew you wouldn't turn down
my little invitation.

15:29.355 --> 15:31.594
Whatever your pathetic plan is,

15:31.712 --> 15:33.551
it ends, now!

15:34.518 --> 15:35.550
Ha!

15:35.600 --> 15:37.734
(BOTH GRUNTING)

15:39.378 --> 15:41.719
SPIDER-MAN: Plan?
You know I never have a plan.

15:42.227 --> 15:44.336
(GRUNTS) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

15:45.071 --> 15:46.639
(GROWLS)

15:47.230 --> 15:48.501
Oh!

15:53.807 --> 15:56.337
Have you got all the Spider's
life-forces? (SCREAMS)

15:56.463 --> 15:58.368
Haven't got ours, Ugly.

15:58.472 --> 16:01.339
That's only a matter of time.
(SCREAMS)

16:01.454 --> 16:02.649
(YELLS)

16:13.127 --> 16:14.727
Peter Parker! Whoa!

16:14.828 --> 16:17.795
Your strengths have
made you a great hero.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.774
What a waste.

16:19.834 --> 16:22.173
SPIDER-GWEN: One thing all Peter
Parkers have in common...

16:22.340 --> 16:24.541
You never stop talking! Ha!

16:24.989 --> 16:26.589
(WOLF SPIDER SCREAMS)

16:29.582 --> 16:31.448
(WOLF SPIDER GRUNTING)

16:34.396 --> 16:35.649
He can go invisible now?

16:35.782 --> 16:37.715
He must have taken
that power from Miles.

16:37.766 --> 16:40.685
If he keeps this up, his powers
will be nearly limitless.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.337
Whoa!

16:43.844 --> 16:45.665
(GROWLS) (SCREAMS)

16:48.782 --> 16:50.712
(GROANING)

16:50.852 --> 16:52.797
There's no way you can win.

16:52.883 --> 16:55.516
I've destroyed every other
heroic Spider-Man.

16:55.602 --> 16:58.248
Yet the Siege always
guided me after you.

16:58.498 --> 17:01.381
For some reason, you seem to
be the center of the Spiders.

17:01.483 --> 17:03.374
My aunt always told me
I was special.

17:03.410 --> 17:04.670
WOLF SPIDER: Once I destroy you,

17:04.763 --> 17:07.238
I will become
the center of the universe.

17:07.413 --> 17:11.238
The only Peter Parker.
The only Spider-Man.

17:11.442 --> 17:13.527
A hero no more.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.824
Just to make sure I'm clear.

17:16.006 --> 17:18.847
You drained the life-forces
of all the other Spider-Men?

17:19.001 --> 17:22.169
Every last one.

17:22.461 --> 17:25.167
Then who am I to stop you
from finishing your mission?

17:26.861 --> 17:28.594
(GRUNTING)

17:31.493 --> 17:33.621
(LAUGHING WICKEDLY)

17:43.088 --> 17:45.464
You let Wolf Spider win?

17:45.652 --> 17:48.386
No. I finally have a plan.

17:48.621 --> 17:51.808
(IN COCKNEY ACCENT) Too late, mate.
It's hopeless. No future.

17:51.972 --> 17:54.675
Come on! You're all Spiders.

17:54.886 --> 17:56.722
So there's one thing
you should know...

17:56.863 --> 17:58.675
It's never hopeless.

18:03.682 --> 18:06.371
It is complete!

18:06.559 --> 18:08.693
I am the most powerful Spi...

18:08.775 --> 18:11.342
(ELECTRICITY POWERING DOWN)

18:14.300 --> 18:15.933
(GRUNTS)

18:20.193 --> 18:22.191
Peter Parker's
a smart guy, Wolfie.

18:22.328 --> 18:24.066
You should've seen this coming.

18:24.322 --> 18:25.698
(GROWLS)

18:30.120 --> 18:32.456
SPIDER-MAN: You made
a huge mistake, Wolf Spider.

18:32.557 --> 18:34.643
You drained the power of heroes.

18:34.801 --> 18:38.276
What's...
What's happening to me?

18:38.518 --> 18:42.385
You said it yourself. In every other
realm, Peter Parker's a good guy.

18:42.542 --> 18:44.026
With someone as evil as you,

18:44.093 --> 18:46.885
you poisoned yourself
by taking our life forces.

18:47.034 --> 18:49.018
(GRUNTS) No...

18:49.565 --> 18:52.456
It can't be!

18:57.857 --> 18:59.635
How did you know
that would work?

18:59.726 --> 19:02.237
I didn't. But I had
faith that together,

19:02.425 --> 19:03.995
we couldn't be stopped.

19:04.073 --> 19:07.620
And that's the reason you're
the center of our universes.

19:10.393 --> 19:12.893
Now, this is a win.

19:15.745 --> 19:17.842
Uh-oh.

19:17.971 --> 19:21.104
Is this the part where you
try to arrest us? Again?

19:21.254 --> 19:22.714
Captain Stacey,

19:22.839 --> 19:24.706
there's something that I need to

19:24.885 --> 19:26.792
just be brave and tell you.

19:26.853 --> 19:29.072
It's... Well...
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

19:29.209 --> 19:31.010
It's okay, Gwen.

19:31.119 --> 19:32.456
I already know.

19:33.411 --> 19:34.643
How?

19:34.768 --> 19:38.198
I followed your trail to an
explosion in an apartment complex.

19:38.459 --> 19:41.315
Rio Morales' apartment,
to be exact.

19:41.671 --> 19:44.506
She helped me see things
with a new perspective.

19:44.659 --> 19:46.848
I understand why you
couldn't tell me, Gwen.

19:46.971 --> 19:48.206
And I'm sorry.

19:48.309 --> 19:50.260
I just wanted to help people.

19:50.425 --> 19:51.589
Like you do.

19:51.659 --> 19:53.711
I never wanted
to keep secrets from you.

19:53.917 --> 19:56.447
Well, now you don't have to.

19:59.220 --> 20:01.086
You don't have
to pack me snacks.

20:01.216 --> 20:03.227
Trips through the worm-hole
take no time whatsoever.

20:03.337 --> 20:05.214
You have an Aunt May
in your world.

20:05.283 --> 20:07.901
You know we don't let
Peter Parkers go anywhere

20:07.971 --> 20:09.182
without being prepared.

20:09.176 --> 20:10.249
SPIDER-MAN: Thank you.

20:10.274 --> 20:12.190
So, Miles,
I guess this is good-bye.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.784
Or is it?

20:13.942 --> 20:15.307
Uh, we were talking and...

20:15.414 --> 20:17.932
I don't have any family here
except Miles.

20:18.070 --> 20:20.417
Wherever he is, is home.

20:20.491 --> 20:23.323
And this world already has
a new Spider to protect it.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.065
Are you saying what I
think you're saying?

20:25.163 --> 20:28.120
Someone's gotta keep the rest
of the Web Warriors in line.

20:28.258 --> 20:29.620
Well, that's true.

20:31.839 --> 20:34.050
Take care of yourself,
Peter Parker.

20:34.175 --> 20:35.768
And tell your Aunt I said "Hi".

20:35.855 --> 20:38.917
I will. Even though
that's really weird.

20:39.025 --> 20:40.667
Ready?

20:44.612 --> 20:46.596
Heard you missed us. We're back!

20:46.768 --> 20:48.268
Freeze!

20:48.440 --> 20:49.784
Who are you?

20:49.869 --> 20:51.307
I'm Spider-Man!

20:51.375 --> 20:52.651
Friendly neighborhood?

20:52.753 --> 20:54.487
You're Nick Fury! You know me!

20:54.573 --> 20:56.874
I've never seen you before
in my life.

20:56.940 --> 20:59.744
Uh-oh, it took us back
to the wrong reality.

20:59.995 --> 21:02.268
(CHUCKLES)

21:02.401 --> 21:04.948
Wait, did Nick Fury
just prank me?

21:05.057 --> 21:06.479
Maybe this is the wrong reality!

21:06.589 --> 21:09.573
For the record, I believed
this joke was in bad taste.

21:09.722 --> 21:12.440
Your face made it all worth it.

21:12.635 --> 21:14.542
Congratulations, Spider-Man.

21:14.721 --> 21:16.542
You saved reality as we know it.

21:16.642 --> 21:19.323
Of course. Did you ever
really doubt we could?

21:21.238 --> 21:23.538
Wait... Hold up.
You did doubt it?

21:23.721 --> 21:25.823
We didn't say that. But
you didn't not say that.

21:25.956 --> 21:27.885
I think I'm going to
like it here.

21:28.003 --> 21:30.276
This? This is nothing.
