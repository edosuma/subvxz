03:16.601 --> 03:18.638
Gustaf.

03:18.736 --> 03:19.908
Read the sign.

03:21.005 --> 03:24.851
Shut off your phone.

03:24.942 --> 03:29.015
You don't have to talk to me
like a robot.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.880
SEPARATE LIVES

03:37.722 --> 03:43.695
Dad, when you were dying,
did you see anything?

03:43.794 --> 03:48.038
Like a tunnel of light
or an angel perhaps?

03:48.132 --> 03:50.078
Did you see my hamster, Pajas?

03:51.836 --> 03:55.340
I saw Viveka.

03:55.439 --> 03:58.579
Daddy, everything will be alright.

03:58.676 --> 04:00.019
No.

04:01.345 --> 04:03.723
She said she wanted
to take a break.

04:05.449 --> 04:09.192
I know, but everything will be fine.

04:13.524 --> 04:16.266
What's happening? Dad?
What the hell is going on?

04:16.360 --> 04:17.532
Gustaf?

04:18.362 --> 04:20.069
Dad? Oh, God.

04:20.164 --> 04:21.541
Am I dead now?

04:24.101 --> 04:25.102
Nope.

04:27.038 --> 04:28.381
That figures.

04:30.041 --> 04:33.614
Gustaf, turn off your phone.

04:33.711 --> 04:37.124
It's on silent.

04:40.718 --> 04:43.756
Oh, no, I think I screwed up!

04:45.389 --> 04:50.236
Mom, I'm so glad to hear that.
I just left Dad, and he's a wreck.

04:50.327 --> 04:52.830
It's just so complicated.

04:53.998 --> 04:58.743
I know, but if you've reconsidered,
he would want to know.

04:58.836 --> 05:00.577
Why does this
have to be so difficult?

05:01.639 --> 05:04.381
Mom, are you listening
to me now?

05:06.777 --> 05:10.054
Do you know what they found
when they checked Daddy's heart?

05:11.682 --> 05:16.791
They found a tiny little man
with a long beard, like a gnome.

05:16.887 --> 05:18.230
I understand, honey.

05:18.322 --> 05:20.768
Mom, you're not listening to me.

05:20.858 --> 05:22.895
Hello? Hi, there!

05:22.993 --> 05:28.705
I'm sorry, but it's just impossible
to change status on this damn...

05:28.799 --> 05:31.507
To what? "Black widow"?

05:31.602 --> 05:35.175
Don't be silly.
I don't want to be "single," just...

05:35.272 --> 05:36.808
"It's complicated."

05:36.907 --> 05:40.150
Stop! Just stop.

05:40.244 --> 05:44.715
Mom, this is going way too fast.
Shouldn't you talk to someone?

05:44.815 --> 05:45.725
Right.

05:45.816 --> 05:49.025
I should know what happens
when you start digging into things.

05:49.120 --> 05:53.000
Therapy can really
mess people's heads up.

05:56.327 --> 06:00.070
What's wrong, Emma?

06:00.164 --> 06:02.610
Did you talk to Bruce?

06:02.700 --> 06:05.271
Not yet.

06:05.369 --> 06:08.475
Darling, I know what we should do.

06:08.572 --> 06:10.950
We're going out tonight!

06:11.041 --> 06:14.113
- No!
- You and me, girls' night out!

09:28.906 --> 09:30.442
Hi-de-ho!

09:31.775 --> 09:33.049
Food's almost ready.

09:33.143 --> 09:35.555
Hi-de-ho yourself.
I'm not hungry.

09:35.646 --> 09:36.954
How are you?

09:37.047 --> 09:40.893
Well, my Dad wants to die,
my Mom wants to live,

09:40.985 --> 09:42.623
my boyfriend's across the ocean,

09:42.720 --> 09:44.927
and I don't know
if we're still together, so...

09:46.223 --> 09:49.261
Bruce shouldn't have left you
in the middle of all this.

09:51.295 --> 09:53.241
I can tell you're angry.

09:53.330 --> 09:57.403
If you want to get back at him a little,

09:57.501 --> 09:59.174
just some quick sex, I'm here.

09:59.269 --> 10:01.249
Are you joking?

10:02.106 --> 10:03.449
Yes, I'm joking!

10:03.540 --> 10:06.248
Not very funny.

10:06.343 --> 10:09.620
- You need to stop all this, Marcus.
- What?

10:09.713 --> 10:12.626
This thing you're doing,
whatever it is.

10:12.716 --> 10:14.354
I love Bruce.

10:14.451 --> 10:16.931
We need some clear rules here.

10:17.021 --> 10:19.262
Okay. Give me rules.

10:19.356 --> 10:20.664
Rule number one:

10:20.758 --> 10:23.295
No jokes about us having sex.
It's not funny.

10:23.394 --> 10:28.173
Rule number two: What's with
this yoga-flute-thing music?

10:28.265 --> 10:30.745
- It makes me calm.
- It has the opposite effect on me.

10:30.834 --> 10:33.337
Candles and flowers...

10:33.437 --> 10:34.916
What is all this?

10:35.005 --> 10:36.382
Stop it!

10:36.473 --> 10:39.079
I'll be back from the bathroom
with more rules.

10:39.176 --> 10:42.885
- Emma...
- I can wipe my own ass, Marcus!

10:42.980 --> 10:44.982
I'm 30 years old!

12:25.816 --> 12:28.660
No, no, no, no, no!

12:28.752 --> 12:31.232
- But it's fun.
- Indeed.

12:31.321 --> 12:33.426
- It's supposed to be tight.
- And, indeed, it is.

12:35.626 --> 12:38.732
- There's a word for women like me.
- Just one?

12:38.829 --> 12:40.433
Yes. What was it?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.001
Cougar!

12:44.101 --> 12:45.637
Women who are like...

12:55.879 --> 12:57.620
Sweet shot!
Is that what they say?

12:57.714 --> 12:59.125
I don't know.

12:59.216 --> 13:03.961
Don't be so grumpy.
We're supposed to have fun.

13:04.054 --> 13:07.263
If I wanted to have fun,
I wouldn't be here.

13:07.357 --> 13:10.270
- Why? Super-handsome guys!
- Where?

13:10.360 --> 13:13.933
No 19-year-olds
with their little perky boobs.

13:14.031 --> 13:17.308
We need to mingle a little.

13:17.401 --> 13:18.846
- Move!
- Mom!

13:18.936 --> 13:19.971
Sit down!

13:22.973 --> 13:24.384
What's wrong with those guys?

13:24.474 --> 13:27.080
Maybe they're here
to watch the game.

13:27.177 --> 13:29.817
And not "Golden Girls."

13:29.913 --> 13:31.517
Cougar!

13:31.615 --> 13:35.222
Mom, I can't sit here
and pretend that I think it's okay

13:35.319 --> 13:41.429
that you leave Dad just like that,
and then stand here half-naked.

13:41.525 --> 13:44.563
I'm not going home with any of them!

13:44.661 --> 13:46.470
That's good to hear.

13:46.563 --> 13:48.372
- Not tonight!
- Stop it.

13:48.465 --> 13:52.106
But I want to feel
that I've still got... it.

13:54.271 --> 13:57.013
Emma, you don't get it,
you're so young.

13:57.107 --> 14:00.884
Well, younger, anyway.

14:00.978 --> 14:03.652
There are so many things
I never did.

14:03.747 --> 14:08.059
I never went skinny-dipping
down by City Hall.

14:08.151 --> 14:11.223
I've never run barefoot through...

14:11.321 --> 14:15.565
Nobody's skinny-dipped by City Hall
since the '60s.

14:15.659 --> 14:18.003
What are you doing now? No!

14:20.130 --> 14:22.906
- Yes!
- Viveka BÃ¶rjesson, put them back on!

14:23.000 --> 14:24.502
- No!
- Yes, I say!

14:24.601 --> 14:26.103
No, I say!

14:29.973 --> 14:32.886
What the hell...?

14:35.779 --> 14:38.919
Ow, I cut myself on a piece of glass!

14:39.016 --> 14:41.792
I'm bleeding like crazy!

14:41.885 --> 14:44.422
- You have to call someone.
- That's not "like crazy."

14:44.521 --> 14:46.159
It hurts!

14:46.256 --> 14:49.669
Do you want to skinny-dip
before or after the hospital?

14:49.760 --> 14:51.239
I don't like that tone!

14:51.328 --> 14:55.299
Thanks so much for the ride.

14:55.399 --> 14:58.243
It was absolutely dreadful.

14:58.335 --> 15:00.872
It's just a cut.

15:00.971 --> 15:03.747
I mean the night in general.

15:05.275 --> 15:08.552
But I guess fate wanted her here.

15:08.645 --> 15:12.115
- There's a hospital closer to...
- Fate.

15:13.684 --> 15:14.924
Hi, Daddy.

15:17.554 --> 15:19.727
Viveka! Are you alright?

15:19.823 --> 15:23.202
- Terrible! Blood everywhere!
- Oh, dear!

15:26.863 --> 15:28.501
Have you had dinner?

15:28.598 --> 15:30.134
No, I lost my appetite

15:30.233 --> 15:32.406
once Mom decided to dress
like "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."

15:33.804 --> 15:37.650
Let me buy you dinner
to celebrate "fate."

15:37.741 --> 15:39.721
- No!
- Ah, the rules.

15:39.810 --> 15:42.848
I can buy you dinner, however.

15:42.946 --> 15:44.391
I know a perfect place.

16:32.963 --> 16:34.874
No signal.

16:34.965 --> 16:37.445
Well, he probably doesn't have time
to talk anyway.

16:37.534 --> 16:40.708
I'll call him later.
It's not even night there yet.

16:40.804 --> 16:42.681
Hey, what's this?

16:42.773 --> 16:45.754
Can't we just have a hot dog?
There's a stand right outside.

16:45.842 --> 16:49.790
No, hot dogs and sauce
make me think about sex.

16:49.880 --> 16:53.794
Stop it! I just don't want you getting
the wrong idea, okay?

16:53.884 --> 16:56.194
You've made that abundantly clear.

16:56.286 --> 16:58.061
Come on, let's eat.

16:59.523 --> 17:03.027
Hold it right there, little man!
No violin playing over there.

17:03.126 --> 17:06.232
Otherwise I'll make sure
you never play again. Get it?

17:06.329 --> 17:09.367
Wow, check it out,
they have oysters!

17:09.466 --> 17:11.571
Okay, no oysters.

17:11.668 --> 17:13.409
Okay.

17:13.503 --> 17:15.505
I can manage!

18:44.094 --> 18:46.802
I'll bring the dessert menu.

18:48.198 --> 18:54.205
I'm sorry for being so difficult
with all the rules and everything.

18:54.304 --> 18:56.375
I guess I'm a little full of myself.

18:56.473 --> 19:02.685
But, in my defense, my life has been
such a mess lately, and I...

19:02.779 --> 19:04.383
It's cool, I get it.

19:04.481 --> 19:05.824
Look...

19:05.916 --> 19:07.395
Don't worry. I'm just a friend
lending some comfort.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.828
Here you go.

19:12.923 --> 19:14.960
Perfect.

19:17.794 --> 19:21.071
What the hell is this?
What are you doing?

19:21.164 --> 19:22.438
Talk about being full of yourself.

19:22.532 --> 19:26.241
Get it through your head!
I don't want you!

19:26.336 --> 19:29.374
I'm so sick of you, Marcus!

19:29.472 --> 19:32.146
You and all your attempts
to get in my pants!

19:32.242 --> 19:34.222
Cut it out!
I'm not interested!

19:34.311 --> 19:37.986
I'm throwing your stuff out tomorrow.
I never want to see you again!

19:40.383 --> 19:42.226
Stop playing!

21:15.578 --> 21:19.025
Have you seen my ring?
I lost it earlier.

21:19.115 --> 21:20.992
Here it is.

21:21.084 --> 21:22.461
Thanks!
