00:08.599 --> 00:11.137
Give them strength, Lord.

00:11.119 --> 00:13.907
Let their hearts beat as one.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.149
Who might this be, Daniel?

00:41.154 --> 00:45.732
I'm not sure. Maybe early Greek,
but I don't recognise the God form.

01:06.909 --> 01:09.826
Sorry, we didn't mean to scare anyone.

01:10.628 --> 01:14.495
- You are not Pelops?
- No, no... You mean him?

01:14.947 --> 01:17.484
Uh, no. We're visitors. Friends.

01:19.466 --> 01:23.677
Husband, the child is near. Please.

01:25.146 --> 01:29.558
The midwife has gone.
I do not know the birthing mysteries.

01:29.465 --> 01:32.915
And the village is too far. Please, help us.

01:35.384 --> 01:36.793
What?

01:36.823 --> 01:39.360
Don't look at me. I don't know what to do.

02:49.608 --> 02:53.024
Push. Push. Push.

02:54.207 --> 02:57.326
- You're doing just fine.
- Where did you learn how to do this?

02:57.567 --> 02:59.441
On a dig in the Yucatรกn.

02:59.445 --> 03:03.859
After the first one, I made friends with the
local midwives and they taught me a lot.

03:03.765 --> 03:06.435
How many babies have you delivered?

03:06.406 --> 03:09.525
Two... counting today.

03:30.881 --> 03:32.956
Alekos...

03:34.240 --> 03:36.233
It's a boy.

03:36.239 --> 03:37.864
<i>Congratulations.</i>

03:37.877 --> 03:40.712
May he grow strong
and bring you honour.

03:44.397 --> 03:47.682
You never cease to amaze me
with all your talents.

03:47.637 --> 03:50.009
Thank you.

03:50.276 --> 03:53.027
Wow, this place is incredible.

03:54.596 --> 03:58.427
It's like we just stepped
into the citadel at Mycenae.

03:58.355 --> 04:00.229
I thought you said it was Greek.

04:00.235 --> 04:04.362
Oh... Mycenae was an ancient city
in the southern Peloponnesus region.

04:04.274 --> 04:05.649
Where's that?

04:05.673 --> 04:07.631
- Greece.
- Why do I do that?

04:07.633 --> 04:11.251
I don't think you should be walking now.
Shouldn't you be resting?

04:11.192 --> 04:14.608
- Daniel, shouldn't she?
- I'm fine!

04:14.992 --> 04:18.360
We wish for you all to be the first to see.

04:21.831 --> 04:24.370
<i>- A birthmark.
- A tri-point.</i>

04:25.071 --> 04:27.146
It will bring him luck.

04:28.949 --> 04:32.816
I would call him Dan'el,
to honour the stranger who birthed him.

04:32.747 --> 04:37.244
- You don't have to do that.
- May we offer you our hospitality?

04:37.146 --> 04:40.516
That'd be nice. Who are you folks?

04:41.187 --> 04:43.262
We are the Chosen.

04:44.146 --> 04:46.816
Where do the gods reside?

04:47.665 --> 04:50.786
Doesn't everyone know?

04:51.624 --> 04:54.661
In the sky, of course.

04:54.624 --> 04:57.115
Of course.

04:57.103 --> 04:59.180
I have a son.

05:11.701 --> 05:16.528
Look at these people. Guess they've
never heard the word "unattractive".

05:18.060 --> 05:20.976
They all look as healthy as a Jaffa.

05:20.939 --> 05:25.149
- That's a good thing, right?
- Can't see anyone who looks over 40.

05:37.456 --> 05:38.487
Um...

05:38.735 --> 05:42.185
Do things feel a little off here?

05:42.134 --> 05:44.423
Are you crazy? It's a paradise.

05:44.413 --> 05:47.084
Yeah, sure. Have an apple.
What could happen?

05:48.533 --> 05:51.451
I am Kynthia. Welcome to our village.

05:52.252 --> 05:55.836
Thank you. Jack O'Neill.

06:12.769 --> 06:16.552
- It is pleasing?
- Very.

06:18.528 --> 06:21.944
- You should have some.
- It is only for you.

06:24.406 --> 06:26.483
Only for me?

06:28.526 --> 06:30.601
Thanks.

06:36.923 --> 06:39.331
"It is only for you."

06:39.403 --> 06:41.858
I think you have a fan, Colonel.

06:41.843 --> 06:45.591
I believe this woman wishes
to spend time with O'Neill.

06:45.523 --> 06:47.598
Thank you, Teal'c.

06:50.161 --> 06:52.487
This place must be loaded with artefacts.

06:52.480 --> 06:56.312
That statue in there must be
the Mycenaean hero Pelops,

06:56.240 --> 06:59.858
who fought from his winged chariot,
hurling lightning bolts.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.254
Poetic way to describe
a Goa'uld death glider.

07:02.278 --> 07:04.355
Yeah, probably.

07:04.358 --> 07:07.312
These people are obviously not labourers.

07:07.278 --> 07:10.528
I must wonder why a Goa'uld
would bring them to this planet.

07:10.478 --> 07:13.928
<i>Perhaps it was a good Goa'uld.</i>

07:15.557 --> 07:18.593
Right Like there is such a thing.

07:19.475 --> 07:23.009
I did not intend
for my statement to be humorous.

07:22.954 --> 07:25.031
Trust me. They weren't.

07:27.553 --> 07:29.427
<i>Hello, girls.</i>

07:29.432 --> 07:32.600
Colonel, where are you goin'? Hello?

07:33.112 --> 07:35.189
Please, sit down.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.352
Unto every man
the Creator gives 100 blissful days.

08:42.299 --> 08:45.883
It is a sin not to celebrate
each and every one.

08:45.818 --> 08:47.894
A 100-day celebration?

08:49.619 --> 08:51.695
Guess we should pace ourselves.

09:07.573 --> 09:10.907
What... exactly just happened?

09:27.370 --> 09:29.447
Kynthia!

09:29.929 --> 09:32.005
Kynthia.

09:57.485 --> 09:59.691
Um...

09:59.683 --> 10:01.759
What happened?

10:02.403 --> 10:07.610
- To them or you?
- We'll talk about that later.

10:07.643 --> 10:10.678
I've seen parties end abruptly,
but never like this.

10:10.642 --> 10:13.014
They all just collapsed.

10:13.760 --> 10:17.711
- It happened just as the sun set.
- Kynthia did the same thing.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.107
What is it? Some kind of
sleeping sickness? What?

10:22.078 --> 10:24.286
There's no sign of fever or pain.

10:24.278 --> 10:27.446
Breathing's shallow.
Heartbeat's slow but regular.

10:28.198 --> 10:30.690
A disease can't affect
everyone all at once.

10:30.678 --> 10:34.510
It seems to be nothing more
than a deep state of sleep.

10:34.437 --> 10:36.513
Now, how about you?

10:37.677 --> 10:40.215
Let's just stick to the matter at hand.

10:40.196 --> 10:42.520
How does an entire village pass out?

10:43.195 --> 10:45.104
Was it something in the food?

10:46.995 --> 10:49.402
We all partook of the same food.

10:49.434 --> 10:51.510
Except for that cake.

10:52.793 --> 10:56.459
Which was "only for you".

11:00.591 --> 11:02.548
Damn. She drugged me.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.506
Whoa.

11:06.510 --> 11:08.836
He's still feeling the effects of the drug.

11:08.831 --> 11:11.666
No. I'm just a little tired.

11:12.110 --> 11:13.520
Colonel?

11:13.549 --> 11:15.875
From now on, we stick to rations.

11:19.349 --> 11:23.181
No fever. Shallow breathing,
slow heartbeat, just like the others.

11:23.106 --> 11:25.479
What the hell is going on here?

11:46.023 --> 11:48.431
Hey, Colonel! How you feeling?

11:49.341 --> 11:52.177
Hung over... but OK.

11:53.942 --> 11:56.018
Gettin' any answers out here?

11:59.139 --> 12:01.428
No. They act as if
what happened was normal.

12:01.421 --> 12:05.500
They party until sundown, they fall
asleep and they wake when the sun rises.

12:05.419 --> 12:07.495
I'd like an explanation.

12:08.019 --> 12:12.349
Daniel, get back to that temple. See what
you can find out. Take Teal'c with you.

12:12.258 --> 12:14.582
Go on!

12:14.618 --> 12:18.116
Carter, keep asking questions out here.

12:26.775 --> 12:29.860
He is the Creator.
Pelops, the giver of days.

12:30.695 --> 12:32.902
This was his home
when he lived among us.

12:32.894 --> 12:35.980
We keep it as it was then,
and we'll do so until he returns.

12:35.932 --> 12:38.423
- When will that be?
- That is a mystery.

12:39.172 --> 12:43.834
Until it is revealed, it is the duty
of the Chosen to rejoice and wait.

12:43.731 --> 12:45.890
Why are your people called the Chosen?

12:45.890 --> 12:49.591
My ancestors were so beloved by Pelops

12:49.530 --> 12:52.235
that he fashioned this garden for us.

12:52.769 --> 12:57.432
It is said he chose us and brought us
here from beyond the stars.

12:57.849 --> 13:00.423
Are there any writings of your history?

13:00.408 --> 13:02.615
"Writings"? I do not know this word.

13:05.086 --> 13:07.163
More of this.

13:08.966 --> 13:12.134
Writings. Do you know what this is?

13:12.086 --> 13:13.414
It is of Pelops.

13:13.485 --> 13:17.068
It is Goa'uld. An obscure dialect.

13:19.644 --> 13:24.307
- Why didn't you tell me that before?
- You never before enquired.

13:24.243 --> 13:27.528
Well, you call it Goa'uld.

13:28.244 --> 13:31.363
I call it Linear A script.

13:31.322 --> 13:33.943
We found pictographics like this
in Ancient Greece,

13:33.922 --> 13:36.413
but we never completely
deciphered this form.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.725
The symbols are a sequence.

13:38.721 --> 13:41.211
What, like a combination?

13:42.000 --> 13:46.912
- What is a combination?
- It's a sequence of symbols...

14:02.875 --> 14:05.248
- Can you read this?
- I believe I can.

14:05.995 --> 14:08.154
It seems to be some sort of record.

14:09.995 --> 14:12.533
An archaic dialect.

14:12.514 --> 14:14.590
Very difficult to decipher.

14:19.432 --> 14:23.761
- I want to show you something!
- OK, I'm coming.

14:29.990 --> 14:32.114
Hi.

14:32.110 --> 14:35.527
I found this shell this morning.
I thought Dan'el might like it.

14:35.470 --> 14:38.174
He can use it as a rattle.
Can you give it to him for me?

14:38.269 --> 14:41.933
Oh, you can do so yourself.
This is Dan'el.

14:42.268 --> 14:45.802
- No, no, I meant the baby.
- This is baby Dan'el.

14:55.066 --> 14:58.186
OK. That's not possible.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.738
Do you not have children
who change and grow?

15:01.823 --> 15:04.361
Well, yeah, sure we do. But not like that.

15:04.822 --> 15:07.610
How old is that boy?

15:09.743 --> 15:11.985
That is Philippos. He's 12.

15:13.143 --> 15:15.764
OK, he's a little big for 12 years old, but...

15:15.743 --> 15:18.030
"Years"? What are "years"?

15:18.981 --> 15:22.517
It would be different for each
planet, but a year is the time it takes

15:22.461 --> 15:25.130
for the globe to complete
one orbit around the sun.

15:25.099 --> 15:27.721
Let's just keep this simple, OK?

15:28.019 --> 15:32.017
Where we come from,
there are 365 days in one year.

15:31.937 --> 15:35.188
No, we have no such
counting of time on Argos.

15:36.217 --> 15:38.376
Philippos is 12 days old.

15:42.417 --> 15:45.702
- How old are you?
- 21 days.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.899
And, um... Kynthia?

15:50.855 --> 15:53.061
31 days.

16:00.533 --> 16:03.533
I think Pelops brought
humans here to be lab rats.

16:04.732 --> 16:08.600
From what we've translated so far,
he wanted to know how humans evolve

16:08.533 --> 16:14.404
so he shortened the life span
to about 1/250th of normal.

16:15.690 --> 16:18.062
So, instead of having
to wait 100,000 years

16:18.049 --> 16:21.668
to see how human physiology evolves,
he could do it in 100%

16:21.609 --> 16:25.688
That is correct. Pelops wanted
to determine what the human host's body

16:25.607 --> 16:30.269
would become in the future,
and perhaps accelerate the process.

16:30.167 --> 16:33.618
How did he do it?
Was it genetic alteration?

16:33.567 --> 16:36.567
We do not know.
It is an archaic dialect.

16:40.404 --> 16:42.480
Daniel?

16:43.163 --> 16:45.038
OK.

16:45.043 --> 16:48.827
I didn't want to say this
till I was absolutely sure, but...

16:48.763 --> 16:51.681
I think he may have created
some kind of virus.

16:53.682 --> 16:57.727
And viruses are often spread
through bodily contact.

16:58.721 --> 17:03.596
- Some are, and some are airborne.
- But I think that this one isn't.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.807
What has drawn you to this conclusion?

17:05.799 --> 17:09.169
Only one of us passed out
last night, and that was Jack.

17:17.998 --> 17:21.747
You have to give them credit
for one thing - they do enjoy life.

17:21.675 --> 17:25.461
Perhaps it is because
they do not have much life to enjoy.

17:25.396 --> 17:30.640
Great. You're telling me this virus - which,
by the way, I do not have - is deadly?

17:30.516 --> 17:35.509
If the kids age five years in five days,
what happens when they reach 100 days?

17:35.795 --> 17:38.119
Colonel!

17:47.952 --> 17:50.622
I guess it wasn't the cake.

17:50.592 --> 17:53.925
Maybe it was your physical contact
with Kynthia.

17:53.869 --> 17:56.906
Get back to Earth, Captain.
Figure this thing out.

18:15.586 --> 18:18.540
Tell me you brought the blood back
in sealed containers.

18:18.506 --> 18:21.126
Of course I did. What is it?

18:21.105 --> 18:25.433
I'm not sure. First I ran a routine check
for antibodies: nothing.

18:25.345 --> 18:27.751
So I thought maybe
this alien bug found a way

18:27.742 --> 18:31.361
to hide from the immune system,
so I ran a protein analysis.

18:31.304 --> 18:33.380
Take a look at what I found.

18:37.342 --> 18:39.798
These are the blood samples
you brought back.

18:39.782 --> 18:43.032
Look at the strange particulate in there.

18:42.980 --> 18:45.519
So that's from one of the Argosians?

18:45.500 --> 18:49.249
Now, that's from Colonel O'Neill.

18:49.699 --> 18:54.194
- Wow. What is it?
- Something we don't have a word for yet.

18:54.098 --> 18:57.384
How come the Colonel has
way more of it than the Argosians?

18:57.338 --> 19:03.342
Maybe because he started out older than
they did, like a head start on this thing.

19:03.656 --> 19:06.362
- I better wake up General Hammond.
- Yeah.

19:12.135 --> 19:14.211
Jack! Carter's coming back!

19:18.334 --> 19:20.410
Jack!

19:41.849 --> 19:44.056
Welcome back, Captain.

19:44.969 --> 19:47.541
So what did you find out?

19:47.848 --> 19:51.134
Come on, now. Don't keep
the elderly waiting. It's rude.

19:55.766 --> 19:59.431
- It isn't a virus.
- All right. What is it?

19:59.486 --> 20:03.186
Doctor Fraiser and I came up empty.
She's still working on it.

20:03.125 --> 20:07.205
- But it's gonna take time.
- Time is something they don't have.

20:08.884 --> 20:12.050
- Nor do I.
- Colonel, there's something else.

20:12.003 --> 20:16.416
Your blood sample showed way more
organisms compared to the Argosians.

20:16.323 --> 20:19.692
- How many more?
- Maybe on the level of 100 times more...

20:19.682 --> 20:21.556
and they are multiplying.

20:22.921 --> 20:27.133
- Which means?
- It means the organism, or whatever it is,

20:27.039 --> 20:29.744
seems to be compensating
for your natural age.

20:29.721 --> 20:33.302
You've lived longer than anyone
with this - for lack of a better word -

20:33.240 --> 20:35.148
disease, ever should.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.282
Cut to it, Captain.

20:39.318 --> 20:41.773
At the rate you're changing,

20:41.798 --> 20:46.461
by the end of two weeks,
you'll be the equivalent of 100 years old.

20:47.556 --> 20:51.387
- So in two weeks I'll be dead?
- Not if I can help it.

20:53.596 --> 20:56.761
- I'd like to set up a lab here.
- Negative, Captain.

20:58.674 --> 21:02.125
We may be able to retard the process
long enough to find a cure.

21:02.075 --> 21:05.906
I want you to pack up
and head back to Earth... now.

21:06.711 --> 21:09.463
All of you. It's an order.

21:09.432 --> 21:13.096
We're not gonna bring another disease
back through that gate.

21:13.030 --> 21:16.730
I will remain here with O'Neill.

21:16.670 --> 21:20.252
I cannot be affected by whatever this is.

21:20.430 --> 21:22.836
I don't need company, I need a cure.

21:23.709 --> 21:28.170
Daniel needs help translating that Goa'uld
tablet thing. It might hold the answer.

21:28.068 --> 21:30.773
- Jack...
- Don't you dare say goodbye.

21:31.508 --> 21:34.592
Cos you damn well
better be coming back soon.

21:39.546 --> 21:42.119
Now get out of here. All of you.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.221
My God!

21:54.223 --> 21:56.299
What?

21:57.541 --> 22:00.958
They're not multiplying,
they're replicating.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.858
<i>What's the difference?</i>

22:02.862 --> 22:06.777
Living organisms multiply.
Machines replicate.

22:07.421 --> 22:10.755
Machines inside the body.
How is that possible?

22:10.901 --> 22:14.020
They're molecular devices
that take on atomic particles

22:13.980 --> 22:16.933
and use them
to make more of themselves.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.022
Well, you're talking nanotechnology.

22:19.057 --> 22:21.299
<i>- Do you know anything about that?
- No.</i>

22:21.298 --> 22:27.252
Yes. At the Pentagon, I worked for a year
with a group that studied nanotechnology.

22:27.136 --> 22:30.588
We were looking at it for a lot
of different uses, one was medicine.

22:30.537 --> 22:34.118
Creating artificial immune systems,
repairing individual cells,

22:34.056 --> 22:37.009
even manipulating DNA
to stop the ageing process.

22:36.976 --> 22:40.890
Sounds like Pelops succeeded in what
you were experimenting with, in reverse.

22:40.815 --> 22:42.688
Nice guy.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.653
What are you lookin' at?

22:53.891 --> 22:59.016
Think you're hot stuff doin' this to me
from six billion light years away?

22:58.891 --> 23:01.463
Can you really talk to the great Pelops?

23:01.450 --> 23:04.784
Sure. Why not? It's just a piece of rock.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.491
He's not so great, anyway.

23:13.167 --> 23:15.575
Your people, they have gone?

23:15.567 --> 23:17.643
Yeah. They've gone.

23:18.446 --> 23:20.522
Then you will leave also?

23:22.086 --> 23:24.163
No, I'll be here for a while.

23:25.046 --> 23:27.288
I am glad.

23:27.285 --> 23:29.692
I would like to learn of your customs.

23:31.365 --> 23:36.359
Maybe some other time, hm?
Kinda got a lot on my mind.

23:36.642 --> 23:39.643
But you ate the marriage cake.
Came to my bed.

23:43.122 --> 23:46.207
Marriage cake?

23:46.280 --> 23:49.365
Kynthia, you thought we were married?

23:49.320 --> 23:51.396
By all our customs, yes.

23:51.401 --> 23:53.477
Sweet...

23:56.000 --> 23:58.076
Kynthia...

23:58.917 --> 24:02.251
What you were feeling wasn't really love.

24:02.478 --> 24:04.849
That takes time.

24:05.436 --> 24:08.355
You can't get to know someone
in one day.

24:09.155 --> 24:12.607
Unto every woman
the Creator gives 100 blissful days.

24:12.635 --> 24:14.842
Kynthia, will you stop that!

24:15.796 --> 24:18.251
Your "Creator" was not a God.

24:18.234 --> 24:20.903
He certainly didn't give you life,
he took it away.

24:20.875 --> 24:24.458
We are the Chosen.
He made this place for us,

24:24.393 --> 24:26.884
to be happy, to love...

24:26.873 --> 24:29.411
To be experimented on!

24:29.873 --> 24:31.747
I mean, look at me!

24:31.832 --> 24:34.584
I'm 40 years old, or I was.

24:34.551 --> 24:39.131
That's thousands and thousands of days.

24:41.070 --> 24:43.229
You do not tell the truth.

24:43.510 --> 24:48.932
The average human life span
is 60 or 70 years.

24:48.788 --> 24:53.082
Some people live to be 100 years!

24:54.107 --> 24:55.731
It is not possible.

24:55.749 --> 24:59.330
Pelops was an alien
who used your people.

24:59.268 --> 25:03.266
He shortened your lives
to satisfy his curiosity.

25:08.986 --> 25:10.017
No.

25:25.541 --> 25:30.002
We've given the nanocytes live tissue to
interact with, but they aren't touching it.

25:29.901 --> 25:32.902
The only thing they appear to do
is make more of themselves.

25:32.861 --> 25:35.647
So how are they causing
the ageing on Argos?

25:35.619 --> 25:39.569
Maybe there's something on Argos that
they need to make them do another task,

25:39.498 --> 25:41.871
something in the air, or the food.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.541
- Is there a problem, Captain?
- I don't know!

25:53.536 --> 25:55.991
Well, it's eating through the rubber.

25:57.736 --> 25:58.980
Oh, God.

25:59.535 --> 26:01.528
What? What is it?

26:01.535 --> 26:03.611
They're trying to spread.

26:29.930 --> 26:34.592
Is it true that you have lived
thousands of days?

26:37.327 --> 26:40.198
I should have kept my mouth shut.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.721
But wouldn't you rather know the truth?

26:47.606 --> 26:49.645
Why do we deserve this?

26:49.924 --> 26:52.000
He can't hear you.

26:54.484 --> 26:56.892
We are good people.

26:56.884 --> 27:00.050
We love each other
and this land you have given us.

27:01.603 --> 27:02.931
Why?

27:03.282 --> 27:07.412
Science. Progress. Knowledge.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.476
Alekos.

27:20.038 --> 27:24.416
What would you do if you had
thousands of days ahead of you?

27:24.317 --> 27:26.726
I would walk out into the world,

27:26.719 --> 27:28.876
beyond the borders of the Chosen.

27:30.198 --> 27:33.401
- Why?
- To see what is there.

27:33.356 --> 27:37.223
No one knows.
Pelops has forbidden us ever to leave.

27:37.195 --> 27:41.359
How has he done that? He's nothin'
but a big piece of rock. He's a statue.

27:41.273 --> 27:46.102
- He will strike us down. It is taught.
- He will not strike you down.

27:46.753 --> 27:49.327
Trust me on that, will you?

27:50.433 --> 27:53.470
Look, go on out there.
Take a walk, see what's there.

27:53.472 --> 27:55.548
Go on.

27:58.592 --> 28:01.000
Then I could return,

28:00.991 --> 28:03.232
and teach the people what I know.

28:03.230 --> 28:07.357
In their thousands of days, they would
learn more and teach their children.

28:07.910 --> 28:09.986
Now you're talkin'!

28:24.787 --> 28:29.034
Come back to the village.
It is not good to be always alone.

28:28.945 --> 28:31.233
Whatever time I have left,

28:31.224 --> 28:33.633
let me spend it my own way.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.420
But you do not spend it. You waste it.

28:43.942 --> 28:46.480
I don't think reflecting on my life,

28:46.461 --> 28:51.965
or tryin' to figure out how to get
the rest of it back, is a waste.

28:52.700 --> 28:54.407
You are angry.

28:55.421 --> 28:57.497
Yes.

28:58.099 --> 29:00.769
Yes, I am.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.824
Aren't you, now that you know the truth?

29:05.617 --> 29:09.236
What can we do
but live in the way we always have?

29:09.178 --> 29:11.420
We do not have thousands of days,

29:11.417 --> 29:13.789
but we treasure every moment.

29:16.656 --> 29:18.614
I know, Kynthia.

29:21.295 --> 29:23.584
But in my heart,

29:26.174 --> 29:28.547
I'm a military man.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.574
A warrior.

29:30.574 --> 29:32.448
That's my life.

29:34.813 --> 29:38.596
To which my ex-wife will attest.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.788
You love her still?

29:45.570 --> 29:49.983
And now, because of me,
you will never see her again.

29:56.568 --> 29:58.442
You meant no harm.

30:01.406 --> 30:03.779
Then let me give what I have taken.

30:05.126 --> 30:08.542
The time of one heartbeat
can become eternity.

30:30.122 --> 30:32.279
I'm sorry, people. My decision is final.

30:32.280 --> 30:35.152
Sir, neither of us show
any evidence of the nanocyte.

30:35.121 --> 30:37.659
We can keep working here
in total isolation.

30:37.641 --> 30:40.844
All blood and tissue samples
are to be incinerated.

30:40.799 --> 30:42.958
Work on the Argos project stops now.

30:42.959 --> 30:47.372
General, you are condemning Colonel
O'Neill and the Argosians to death.

30:47.279 --> 30:53.365
Captain Carter, these things appear
to possess artificial intelligence. Correct?

30:53.197 --> 30:56.400
Yes, sir. They adapt
their programming to their situation.

30:56.356 --> 30:58.682
So they could adapt themselves
out of here.

30:58.676 --> 31:02.295
Sir, if we destroy the samples,
we will have nothing to work from.

31:02.236 --> 31:04.394
Sorry, the risk is just too great.

31:04.515 --> 31:06.590
- The order is final.
- Sir!

31:08.115 --> 31:11.115
We cannot just leave him there.

31:12.394 --> 31:15.512
Doctor Jackson,
Colonel O'Neill is one of the finest men

31:15.472 --> 31:18.344
it has ever been my pleasure
to serve with.

31:18.311 --> 31:22.441
He will be a great loss to this country,
and to all of us in this room.

31:22.351 --> 31:24.391
But I am sure he would not hesitate

31:24.391 --> 31:28.140
to make the same decision for himself
that I am making now.

31:34.430 --> 31:38.641
<i>We're working with computer
simulations and practical simulations.</i>

31:38.548 --> 31:43.009
<i>Realistically, sir,
I'm afraid it might take years.</i>

31:42.907 --> 31:47.653
<i>The general says gate travel
to Argos is off limits for the next few...</i>

31:47.546 --> 31:49.253
<i>millennia.</i>

31:49.267 --> 31:54.058
<i>But we can send objects through
so, if you need anything, just call.</i>

31:57.345 --> 31:59.421
<i>Say something.</i>

32:00.184 --> 32:02.971
<i>Colonel, I have learned
very much from you.</i>

32:03.903 --> 32:06.525
<i>Thank you.</i>

32:06.502 --> 32:08.578
<i>You know, goodbyes really suck.</i>

32:33.176 --> 32:35.585
Excuse me.

32:37.016 --> 32:39.092
What are you doin'?

32:39.816 --> 32:43.599
Your people do not have
enough knowledge to help us.

32:43.536 --> 32:45.612
We must ask Pelops to return.

32:47.454 --> 32:49.530
For cryin' out loud!

32:51.255 --> 32:55.632
Old Pelops doesn't give a rat's ass
about things like love.

32:56.893 --> 33:02.432
His kind kidnap people like you and take
'em to other worlds to be used as slaves!

33:03.090 --> 33:05.084
Pelops thinks of us as his slaves?

33:11.890 --> 33:14.428
Then I will no longer be
one of the Chosen.

33:15.650 --> 33:17.726
Nor will I.

33:19.048 --> 33:21.836
That's the message
you oughta be sendin'.

33:57.761 --> 34:00.512
<i>He... He did not strike us.</i>

34:10.518 --> 34:12.594
So you like older men, do ya?

34:14.677 --> 34:17.168
- What is it?
- We should go back.

34:17.157 --> 34:19.364
We have gone too far from the village.

34:19.356 --> 34:21.431
Pelops forbids it.

34:21.876 --> 34:24.414
He's gone, Kynthia. He's gone.

34:26.356 --> 34:28.431
It'll be OK.

34:29.076 --> 34:31.152
I promise.

34:38.271 --> 34:40.347
<i>Here.</i>

34:41.992 --> 34:43.652
Oh, hell!

34:44.751 --> 34:47.871
I'll have to teach you a game I can win.

34:48.632 --> 34:50.708
It is good to see you smile.

34:52.351 --> 34:56.563
Tell me, will you live the rest
of your days without making love?

34:56.630 --> 34:58.503
Oh, God, I hope not.

35:00.389 --> 35:03.472
Oh, we'd probably just pass out.

35:08.706 --> 35:10.782
Why aren't we unconscious yet?

35:13.626 --> 35:16.413
It should have happened already, Kynthia.

35:18.985 --> 35:21.061
Why aren't we asleep?

35:26.063 --> 35:31.603
<i>- No one has awakened.
- Except for us. Why?</i>

35:32.262 --> 35:37.054
How important is this rule
that no one can leave the village?

35:37.501 --> 35:39.577
It is Pelops' first law.

35:42.101 --> 35:46.347
Whatever it is that knocks us all out
at night, it's right here.

35:46.938 --> 35:48.931
What?

35:50.498 --> 35:56.952
I'll bet you and I stayed awake
because we walked out of range.

35:56.778 --> 36:03.112
The cure could be as simple
as just gettin' the hell out of Dodge.

36:04.577 --> 36:08.704
If we stay out of proximity, no sleep.

36:08.695 --> 36:12.739
They all stay here,
they get no wake-up call.

36:13.894 --> 36:17.228
There's got to be some other variable.

36:18.492 --> 36:20.900
Some other change.

36:55.606 --> 36:57.266
Excuse me.

36:57.286 --> 36:59.362
I've got a phone call to make.

37:16.601 --> 37:18.677
Welcome back, kids.

37:20.402 --> 37:22.478
It's damn good to see you again.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.702
Don't worry.

37:28.719 --> 37:33.048
Aside from a little prostate problem
we won't go into,

37:33.958 --> 37:36.034
it's not so bad.

37:41.717 --> 37:46.295
I was right. It's a transmitter.

37:46.317 --> 37:49.271
Two sets of glyphs
were quite tough to translate,

37:49.235 --> 37:51.987
until Teal'c realised they weren't words.

37:51.954 --> 37:55.903
- They were, in fact, numbers.
- Two different frequencies.

37:55.833 --> 37:59.001
One to put the villagers to sleep
and activate the nanocyte,

37:58.954 --> 38:01.360
the second one to shut it
all off for the day.

38:01.353 --> 38:05.565
When you broke the statue, you must
have damaged the wake-up call.

38:05.472 --> 38:09.969
Can you recalibrate this thing
to wake these people up?

38:09.992 --> 38:14.119
No, sir, it's useless. I have to use
the equipment that we brought with us.

38:15.510 --> 38:19.128
I've loaded the frequency.
I'm switching it on now.

38:35.347 --> 38:38.052
Alekos, the sun has already journeyed!

38:38.864 --> 38:40.940
Why do we wake so late?

38:43.226 --> 38:47.519
Our tests show that your body is cleansed
of the machines that plagued you.

38:47.423 --> 38:51.338
I figure the immune system must
attack them if they aren't operating.

38:51.262 --> 38:55.047
From now on, you and your people
should age at a normal rate.

38:55.742 --> 38:57.735
What about Jack?

38:57.742 --> 38:59.534
Me?

38:59.543 --> 39:01.619
I'll probably move to Florida.

39:02.460 --> 39:06.244
Get into little retirement home
of some kind.

39:06.179 --> 39:09.181
You'd look pretty out of place there
at your age.

39:09.141 --> 39:11.429
Why? I look like my grandfather.

39:11.739 --> 39:13.945
"Look" is the operative word here.

39:13.938 --> 39:18.516
If our hypothesis is right, the nanocytes
in your system only imitate ageing.

39:18.418 --> 39:22.463
They weren't meant to start
the process in a full-grown adult.

39:22.458 --> 39:25.909
- What are you sayin'?
- Without these buggers in your system

39:25.858 --> 39:29.557
to maintain the changes, you should
return to normal in a week or two.

39:29.496 --> 39:31.572
That is wonderful news!

39:32.934 --> 39:35.260
I don't know.

39:35.255 --> 39:40.297
I was kinda lookin' forward to
a little shuffleboard with the fellas.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.329
Then you are leaving?

39:59.449 --> 40:01.856
You will not be staying with me, then?

40:03.688 --> 40:06.179
No, I won't.

40:08.009 --> 40:11.460
What will happen to us now,
if Pelops returns?

40:12.248 --> 40:14.489
I don't think that's gonna happen.

40:18.365 --> 40:22.992
But just in case, we'll send some folks by
now and again, check up on you.

40:23.643 --> 40:27.096
My heart would be glad
if you were one of them.

40:27.045 --> 40:31.838
Sweet Kynthia,
I've learned so much from you.

40:34.322 --> 40:38.072
I'll treasure every day of my life

40:38.442 --> 40:40.518
cos of you.

40:41.961 --> 40:43.954
For thousands of days?

40:45.681 --> 40:47.757
I sure hope so.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.639
That is almost forever.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.476
Almost.
