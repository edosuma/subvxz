00:01.194 --> 00:02.593
Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:02.662 --> 00:05.631
- You in on the pawn shop?
- I planned the whole thing.

00:05.698 --> 00:09.099
Two guys wearin' Groucho glasses?
You get those things on and off in a second.

00:09.168 --> 00:11.830
How'd you learn about 'em?

00:11.904 --> 00:14.896
I was like 13, and there was this old fighter
named Patsy Ferrara.

00:14.974 --> 00:17.841
He taught me about 'em.
There was a lot of tough guys that had birds.

00:17.910 --> 00:20.504
- You're outta here, Steve.
- Right.

00:20.580 --> 00:24.141
- What about that money you talked about?
- We're givin' you 50 bucks.

00:24.217 --> 00:27.243
- Huh, what happened to 200?
- We took 150 off for you gettin' cute.

01:03.723 --> 01:06.715
Hey, Mike. What's goin' on?

01:06.792 --> 01:09.693
- We got a problem, Bobby.
- Come here.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.824
What's up?

01:13.900 --> 01:16.300
Patsy Ferrara's in trouble.

01:16.369 --> 01:18.963
- They got him down at the 64th Precinct.
- He's locked up?

01:19.038 --> 01:23.168
He punched a guy- some Salvadoran
that works at Tommy Frumento's place.

01:23.242 --> 01:27.235
- He was peein' on the sidewalk outside
ofTommy's coffee shop- - Patsy was peein'?

01:27.313 --> 01:30.646
- Hi.
- Busboy comes out to stop him, and he clocked him real good.

01:30.716 --> 01:34.846
- Well, was he drunk?
- No. He's, uh- His mind is slippin', I think, Bobby.

01:34.921 --> 01:37.389
No. That's just Patsy. All right?
Too many hooks.

01:37.456 --> 01:40.687
No. L-I know what's Patsy.
I'm tellin' you, this is different.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.990
A couple of days
he forgot to come to work.

01:43.062 --> 01:45.860
I mean, I try to talk to him,
it's like he ain't even all there.

01:45.932 --> 01:51.268
- So Tommy couldn't reach out to this busboy?
- I guess not. The guy got a cop.

01:51.337 --> 01:53.703
All right.
Let me make a few phone calls.

01:53.773 --> 01:56.173
Mikey, Patsy's still got a job with you, right?

01:56.242 --> 01:58.710
- I can say he works for you.
- He's always got a job with me, Bobby.

01:58.778 --> 02:01.747
- I'm just tellin'you what's the situation.
- All right, Mikey.

02:01.814 --> 02:04.874
- Okay. Hey, how's your birds?
- My birds are all right. How about yours?

02:04.951 --> 02:07.749
- Yeah, they're all right. I gotta get back.
- All right.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.746
What's up?

02:12.892 --> 02:15.190
Ah, the old guy that, uh, taught me birds...

02:15.261 --> 02:17.195
he took a collar in the 64.

02:17.263 --> 02:19.197
Patsy Ferrara.

02:19.265 --> 02:23.463
- Club fighter? Used to fight at Sunnyside?
- Yeah. Fought some ranked guys.

02:23.536 --> 02:26.937
- He fought Archie Moore.
- We got an abduction on 10th and First.

02:27.006 --> 02:31.204
A guy got snatched off the street
in broad daylight. Everybody on it.

02:33.346 --> 02:36.247
- We might have a lead-
- Okay, Andy, I'll catch up with you, all right?

02:36.315 --> 02:40.945
Probably a Colombian drug dealer.
I ain't gonna run any red lights.

04:03.238 --> 04:05.399
The victim was comin' out
of that pastry shop...

04:05.474 --> 04:08.341
when two guys with ski masks
jumped out of a gray van.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.537
They bludgeoned the driver,
then grabbed him up.

04:10.612 --> 04:14.776
Name is Bernard Kaiser. He's some kind
ofheavy hitter. I got eyewitnesses right here.

04:14.850 --> 04:18.250
- Anybody get a plate?
- Yeah, four numbers. I put it out with a description of the van.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.778
- That's the driver?
- Yeah. Larry Simms is his name.

04:21.857 --> 04:24.951
- Victim's a legit guy with juice.
- Yeah, we're gonna have company.

04:25.027 --> 04:29.521
- You want us to canvass?
- Yeah. You better let the boss know he oughta call Aiello.

04:29.598 --> 04:33.364
- I'll check the car out.
- Yeah. Larry Simms, I'm Detective Sipowicz.

04:33.435 --> 04:35.903
Look, you guys gotta find Mr. Kaiser.
He's got a bad heart.

04:35.971 --> 04:39.805
- Tell me what happened.
- Uh, Mr. Kaiser likes to stop at this bakery every morning.

04:39.875 --> 04:42.241
They got some kinda
fat-free muffin that he likes.

04:42.311 --> 04:45.439
- He goes in there by himself? No bodyguards or anything?
- He's not like that.

04:45.514 --> 04:47.573
He's like a regular guy, only rich.

04:47.649 --> 04:50.709
I mean, I'm supposed to look after him-
as much as he lets me.

04:50.786 --> 04:53.152
- And these guys came at you?
- Yeah, out of a dark gray van.

04:53.222 --> 04:57.420
- And one of the gorillas swung a tire iron at my head.
- Describe the gorilla.

04:57.493 --> 05:00.257
- I'm director of security-
- Uh, stocking mask, uh, blue ski cap...

05:00.329 --> 05:02.661
- uh, gloves, white guy-
- That's the guy you want to talk to.

05:02.731 --> 05:04.665
Huge, 6'4".

05:04.733 --> 05:07.497
Didn't get much of a look at the other guy.
He was wearin' a ski hat too.

05:07.569 --> 05:10.231
William Crawford, director of security
for the Kaiser Companies.

05:10.305 --> 05:13.138
- Mr. Crawford, I am sorry-
- You talk later. You're in charge here?

05:13.208 --> 05:16.473
- Yeah. Detective Sipowicz.
- Well, we gotta move on this fast.

05:16.545 --> 05:18.843
Mr. Kaiser's got a heart condition.

05:18.914 --> 05:22.247
- Feels like an audiotape.
- Well, that's probably the ransom demand.

05:22.317 --> 05:25.411
- I got a tape deck in my car. We can hear it right now.
- Who's this?

05:25.487 --> 05:28.456
- Can you make a statement
about the case?

05:28.524 --> 05:32.620
- We'd do better at the station house. Only a few blocks away.
- I want the F.B.I. Notified.

05:32.694 --> 05:35.458
- We do that in kidnappings. Let's finish looking at the car.
- You got it.

05:35.531 --> 05:37.624
I used to be in the Bureau, so I...

05:37.699 --> 05:40.998
I know what kind of technology
and manpower they can bring to bear.

05:41.069 --> 05:43.731
Oh, they got massive technology.

05:51.213 --> 05:53.204
This way. Upstairs.

05:54.750 --> 05:58.438
Lf, uh- If you two gentlemen
can wait in here.

05:59.439 --> 06:01.430
I'll be right back.

06:06.446 --> 06:09.381
Donna.

06:09.449 --> 06:11.246
Hi, Greg.

06:11.318 --> 06:15.152
- You surprised me.
- I'm back from my course.

06:15.222 --> 06:19.659
Yeah, y-y-you sorta snuck up on me there,
just suddenly being at the refrigerator.

06:19.726 --> 06:21.660
Hmm.

06:21.728 --> 06:23.696
- So, how have you been?
- Very well. Yeah.

06:23.763 --> 06:26.163
- Good.
- We had an abduction. I'm...

06:26.233 --> 06:28.394
I'm just gonna be, uh,
interviewing some witnesses.

06:28.468 --> 06:30.436
- Do you need the room?
- Eventually.

06:30.504 --> 06:34.406
Um, uh, toast your Danish.

06:34.474 --> 06:37.272
So, y-you're, um...

06:37.344 --> 06:41.280
you're all versed in computers now-
the information superhighway?

06:41.348 --> 06:46.615
- It, um, was a word processing class.
- Oh, that special skill, huh?

06:46.686 --> 06:50.588
- How's your family?
- Very well. The girls...

06:50.657 --> 06:53.592
- Yeah. Uh, Jamie made all-star- her soccer league.
- Hmm.

06:53.660 --> 06:57.187
Yeah. And Marie and me,
that area, you know...

06:57.264 --> 07:00.256
that's more or less resumed
being an utter disaster.

07:00.333 --> 07:02.631
I'm sorry.

07:02.702 --> 07:05.432
Ah, you don't have to be sorry.

07:05.505 --> 07:07.871
It's that some people
are meant for disaster.

07:07.941 --> 07:10.034
Yeah.

07:10.110 --> 07:15.047
- Anyway, yeah, it's, uh- it's good to see you.
- Thank you.

07:15.115 --> 07:17.845
- Y-Your Danish done?
- Mm-hmm.

07:17.918 --> 07:21.081
Yeah, I'm gonna go get,
uh, the witnesses now.

07:22.889 --> 07:27.223
Meet our conditions or Bernard Kaiser will die.

07:27.294 --> 07:30.991
Prepare three million dollars
in used $20 bills.

07:31.064 --> 07:34.727
Put the money in three suitcases.

07:34.801 --> 07:37.770
We will call with further instructions.

07:37.837 --> 07:41.432
- The man had no sense
on the subject of personal security.

07:41.508 --> 07:44.272
- You could talk till you were blue in the face.
- What distortion is that?

07:44.344 --> 07:48.280
Computer-generated voice. They got software now
that'll speak whatever you type into it.

07:48.348 --> 07:52.341
Now we got two people at the corporate
headquarters waitin'on the follow-up phone call

07:52.419 --> 07:57.083
two from Homicide at Kaiser's condominium and
two from Major Case at the home in Connecticut.

07:57.157 --> 08:01.218
The phones are trapped at each location,
and we're still canvassing on 10th Street.

08:01.294 --> 08:05.025
Out of here we follow up on witness statements,
go through the company personnel records...

08:05.098 --> 08:07.828
that is, if Mr. Crawford's
ever gonna produce 'em for us.

08:07.901 --> 08:11.598
- The F.B.I. Comin' in?
- They've been notified. Right now, it's our investigation.

08:14.074 --> 08:16.008
Ah, chief of D's.

08:16.076 --> 08:18.670
- Can we put this on hold for a few minutes?
- Yeah, sure.

08:21.414 --> 08:25.282
- Detective Russell on line two. She says it's urgent.
- Thanks, Donna.

08:25.352 --> 08:28.651
- Detective Simone, Tommy Frumento to see you.
- Diane, what's up?

08:31.057 --> 08:34.457
- Give me two minutes with this guy.
- I'll let you know what you miss.

08:34.527 --> 08:38.121
Yeah. Yeah, I know, the F.B.I...

08:38.198 --> 08:40.063
Tommy, appreciate your comin' in.

08:40.133 --> 08:43.933
Yeah, well, I don't appreciate
Patsy pissin' on my place.

08:44.004 --> 08:46.837
Yeah. Come out here for a second.

08:46.906 --> 08:48.840
Tommy, you gotta know
that wasn't personal.

08:48.908 --> 08:52.742
- Tell that to the guy whose face he busted.
- This busboy lay hands on him?

08:52.812 --> 08:56.805
Maybe he gave him a shove. Point is, on top of
doin' what he was doin' on the sidewalk...

08:56.883 --> 08:58.874
while I got people
in there eatin' breakfast...

08:58.952 --> 09:01.978
Patsy turns around, gives my guy
a hard shot to the face.

09:02.055 --> 09:04.080
Busboy all right?
He had to go to the hospital?

09:04.157 --> 09:07.888
- Uh, no. He- He didn't wanna lose a day's pay.
- But he wanted Patsy charged?

09:07.961 --> 09:10.759
He wanted him charged.
That's-That's his position.

09:10.830 --> 09:15.096
Look, I tell you the truth, Bobby. Every morning
the guy sits in my joint 45 minutes...

09:15.168 --> 09:17.102
with a coffee and a Danish.

09:17.170 --> 09:19.331
Half the people he talks to
he don't even know.

09:19.406 --> 09:21.806
What if we get Patsy to promise
not to come around anymore?

09:21.875 --> 09:25.072
- You think the busboy will cool out?
- I don't know. Uh...

09:25.145 --> 09:29.411
- I- I might be able to talk to him.
- That would be great, Tommy.

09:29.482 --> 09:33.543
- You know, I- I got a business to run.
- Yeah, I understand that.

09:33.620 --> 09:38.455
- Let me explain things to Patsy.
- Yeah, I'm- I'll try to cool out the busboy.

09:38.525 --> 09:40.459
- How's your birds?
- Good.

09:40.527 --> 09:42.461
Okay. Uh, you gotta excuse me, man.

09:42.529 --> 09:46.522
Yeah, you-you should come around yourself
sometime, Bobby. Got great haddock on Tuesdays.

09:46.599 --> 09:47.623
Yeah.

09:48.601 --> 09:51.627
Bill Crawford.
I was at the Bureau for 22 years.

09:51.705 --> 09:56.404
Uh-huh. Frederick Wilson, Inspector.
Assistant special agent in charge.

09:56.476 --> 09:59.240
- I just spoke with chief of detectives.
- He told you we're taking over?

09:59.312 --> 10:01.246
- Yeah.
- Really? All our cases?

10:01.314 --> 10:03.111
Have you met Lieutenant Fancy?

10:03.183 --> 10:05.811
- How you doin'?
- We've relieved your people...

10:05.885 --> 10:08.285
at Kaiser's office
and both places of residence.

10:08.355 --> 10:12.018
- My detective called and told me.
- I'm sorry for the delay in apprising you.

10:12.092 --> 10:15.220
- Excuse me.
- These witnesses from East 10th Street?

10:15.295 --> 10:18.560
- Mm-hmm. You want our interview notes?
- We'll reinterview.

10:18.631 --> 10:22.499
But sure.
Round them up. Get 'em down to our office.

10:22.569 --> 10:25.538
The perpetrators have made second contact.
We'll have instructions...

10:25.605 --> 10:28.733
- about the money drop at 9:00 tomorrow morning.
- You trap the call?

10:28.808 --> 10:31.436
- Covered.
- That's the original ransom demand.

10:31.511 --> 10:34.674
- Could I have that, please?
- Certainly.

10:34.748 --> 10:37.308
- Will you want liaison on the money drop?
- Sure. We'll give you a call.

10:37.384 --> 10:41.445
Gentlemen, grateful for your cooperation.

10:48.928 --> 10:51.988
Lieu, um, I need to put in
for some lost time.

10:52.065 --> 10:54.431
We're not busy here.

11:00.140 --> 11:04.839
Hello, Miss Donna Abandando.
Remember me?

11:04.911 --> 11:08.438
- Vaguely.
- Steven Ronald Richards. Nice to see you.

11:08.515 --> 11:13.350
- Who do you wanna see, Steve?
- Well, not to be so mysterious about it...

11:13.420 --> 11:15.354
but, Donna, what's about
to happen for me...

11:15.422 --> 11:18.823
I mean, this is, like, a turnabout in luck
so strong, I don't know...

11:18.892 --> 11:21.520
like, what to do with myself.

11:21.594 --> 11:26.190
- Which would make you want to see who?
- Right. Of course. Actually...

11:26.266 --> 11:29.201
Martinez. Detective.
Steve Richards. Remember me?

11:29.269 --> 11:31.965
About a year back I helped you
with that, uh, pawn shop robbery...

11:32.038 --> 11:34.734
- the guys- they had the fake noses with the, uh-
- Groucho glasses.

11:34.808 --> 11:38.574
- Eh-hey! I led you to those guys, remember?
- I remember you, Steve. Yeah.

11:38.645 --> 11:42.604
One of the scumbags offered you a cut.
You were ready to sell us down the toilet.

11:42.682 --> 11:45.344
Well, uh-
That's good.

11:45.418 --> 11:48.387
Yeah. Well, I'm a different man today, Detective.
Let me start by saying...

11:48.455 --> 11:53.859
I am totally straightnot a parking citation,
nothing. Last 10 months? Check me out.

11:53.927 --> 11:56.521
Yeah. What do you need here, Steve?

11:56.596 --> 11:59.360
That guy this morning
who got snatched?

11:59.432 --> 12:02.230
- I got information- put you with a player in that.
- Mm?

12:02.302 --> 12:04.270
- Uh-huh.
- Talk me outta my doubts.

12:04.337 --> 12:07.500
Come on. In context of our history,
for me to come here and run somethin'?

12:07.574 --> 12:12.307
You guys'd beat the ass off me,
and I would, you know, totally deserve it, right?

12:12.378 --> 12:16.246
- Anyway, Steve, it looks like the F.B.I.'s takin' this case.
- Oh, the Bureau is, huh?

12:16.316 --> 12:20.343
- He got somethin' on the kidnapping?
- I do. Yes, I do. Absolutely.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.888
- Steve nearly burned us on a case last year, Andy.
- Yeah, but...

12:22.956 --> 12:26.858
I nearly burned you, but my information
was solid. Is that a fair appraisal? Right?

12:26.926 --> 12:29.759
My name's Sipowicz.
I'd be interested in hearin' what you got.

12:29.829 --> 12:33.265
Pleasure to meet you, Sipowicz.
Steve Richards. Glad to know you, Sipowicz.

12:33.333 --> 12:38.703
I hear the, uh, F.B.I. Is...
takin' over. Is that a fact?

12:38.771 --> 12:44.038
- Yes. Uh, we have.
- Oh, I see.

12:44.110 --> 12:46.738
'Cause I could break this case for you.

12:46.813 --> 12:51.216
Mm-hmm. Right money,
I could break this case wide open.

12:51.284 --> 12:54.720
- Why don't we talk in here, uh, Steve.
- Absolutely.

13:05.899 --> 13:10.029
I'd rather this weren't, like, a footing-
who's gonna show their thing first, you know?

13:10.103 --> 13:13.334
I mean, we're adults.
No need to act that way, am I right?

13:13.406 --> 13:17.069
On the other hand, you know,
um, some, uh, aspect...

13:17.143 --> 13:21.375
with specifics in terms of, like, a money figure-
I'd, uh, be grateful.

13:21.447 --> 13:24.974
The kidnap victim was rich, Steve,
and he's got a heart condition.

13:25.051 --> 13:28.145
- You wanna sit down?
- Meaning, reason for optimism, you know...

13:28.221 --> 13:31.213
with family gratitude or, like,
a willingness to generosity, right?

13:31.291 --> 13:33.418
- Well put.
- Hmm. Let me ask ya...

13:33.493 --> 13:39.056
um, how would that translate...
with specific figures? Any indication there?

13:39.132 --> 13:41.862
I don't wanna seem impatient, Steve,
but, uh, you're in a situation...

13:41.935 --> 13:44.062
where you could get... struck.

13:44.137 --> 13:48.005
That's fine. Fair-
I- I'm sorry. No problem.

13:49.075 --> 13:51.908
Let me partially expose myself.

13:51.978 --> 13:54.344
I was, uh, outside O.T.B. Yesterday...

13:54.414 --> 13:56.541
- Which office?
- Grand Street...

13:56.616 --> 13:58.550
which I bet...

13:58.618 --> 14:02.110
and I'm outdoors-
'cause the secondhand smoke is a menace...

14:02.188 --> 14:04.679
and I'm, like, three feet
from this public pay phone...

14:04.757 --> 14:07.282
and I overhear this, you know, fragment.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.761
Guy says,
Why are you gonna grab him in the daylight?"

14:10.830 --> 14:12.798
- From the guy on the telephone?
- Exactly.

14:12.865 --> 14:17.962
So now, what, I am totally interested, correct?
Then I hear him say...

14:18.037 --> 14:21.404
- And you're gonna take him at the bakery?"
- And you can pick this guy out.

14:21.474 --> 14:24.602
I could absolutely pick this guy out,
and he's a gambling degenerate...

14:24.677 --> 14:26.645
you know, with reliable whereabouts.

14:26.713 --> 14:29.546
He'd still be gambling even if he just, uh,
kidnapped someone?

14:29.616 --> 14:33.518
Actually, I'm suggesting an aspect of, uh,
knowledge on his part...

14:33.586 --> 14:38.649
for possibly, uh,
not actually participating in the snatch.

14:40.460 --> 14:43.486
Can we discuss a specific money figure
at this time, please?

14:43.563 --> 14:46.361
What are you lookin' for?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.734
A hundred thousand dollars.

14:51.204 --> 14:53.832
Is that- I mean, uh,
uh, that's probably, you know, uh...

14:53.906 --> 14:57.000
more than you're used to hearing.
I mean, it's a lot of money, you know, actually...

14:57.076 --> 15:01.240
That shouldn't be a problem,
if your information is productive.

15:01.314 --> 15:03.475
No, I don't see it as a problem.
No. Not at all.

15:03.549 --> 15:05.244
- Mm. Not in my opinion.
- No?

15:05.318 --> 15:08.253
Oh, my God...

15:18.231 --> 15:20.597
- There you go.
- Thanks.

15:22.035 --> 15:24.526
Hey, Patsy.

15:24.604 --> 15:26.868
Ah, Bobby Simone.

15:26.939 --> 15:31.171
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- I'm arrested. They said I hit a guy.

15:31.244 --> 15:33.974
Yeah. Uh, look, Patsy,
you're gonna get a D.A.T...

15:34.047 --> 15:37.039
a Desk Appearance Ticket.
I'll explain outside.

15:37.116 --> 15:40.449
- How's your birds?
- They're good. Come on. I'll tell ya outside.

15:42.188 --> 15:45.885
Man, I gotta get back to work.
Fat Mike's gonna kill me.

15:49.762 --> 15:52.026
The second time
I was ever collared.

15:52.098 --> 15:57.035
They had me the chickie once, when they stole
some copper wire off a construction site.

15:57.103 --> 16:01.233
- Nah, you were the lookout?
- I was 11.

16:01.307 --> 16:03.798
Did my old man smack me.

16:03.876 --> 16:08.006
Never again.
Birds and boxing.

16:08.081 --> 16:11.949
So Patsy, tell me about this here-
you know, outside Tommy's.

16:12.018 --> 16:14.646
Well, I guess I hit a guy
outside ofTommy Frumento's.

16:14.721 --> 16:17.019
But why did that guy
start shovin' like that?

16:17.090 --> 16:20.321
You were pissin' out in front
of the coffee shop there.

16:20.393 --> 16:23.590
No, just don't you start sayin' that.
That's everyone sayin' that.

16:23.663 --> 16:27.064
I'd remember doin'
somethin' like that.

16:27.133 --> 16:30.000
- So, you don't remember doin' it, huh?
- I didn't do it.

16:30.069 --> 16:32.663
Now, don't start with this
not rememberin'."

16:32.739 --> 16:35.230
This is us right here, Patsy.

16:36.642 --> 16:38.940
- So, how's your birds doin'?
- They're good.

16:39.011 --> 16:44.074
- I gave ya your first bird. You remember that?
- Oh, yeah. I do.

16:44.150 --> 16:46.710
- I gotta get back to work.
- No, Patsy.

16:46.786 --> 16:49.949
- Uh, Mike, he gave you the day off.
- What do I got the day off for?

16:50.022 --> 16:52.889
We're gonna go see a doctor.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.094
No, sir. No.

16:56.162 --> 16:59.859
They see an old pug like me,
they figure they're gonna make a few bucks.

16:59.932 --> 17:04.460
Right away they start findin' things wrong
where there ain't even nothin' wrong.

17:04.537 --> 17:09.736
- Look, Patsy, I- I wanna see that you're examined,
all right? - I'm not gonna go see a doctor!

17:09.809 --> 17:12.277
- Now, that's enough!
- All right.

17:16.516 --> 17:19.348
- I gotta get to work.
- All right.

17:19.417 --> 17:22.910
But, see, Patsy, um, we still gotta go over
back to my precinct, you know...

17:22.989 --> 17:27.085
'cause, um, the D.A. -
he's gotta sign off on your case.

17:27.160 --> 17:30.254
- I thought I just got some kind of a ticket.
- Yeah, but the D.A...

17:30.329 --> 17:32.490
he's still's gotta sign off,
you know?

17:34.200 --> 17:38.796
- I don't mean to be irritable. I know you're tryin' to help.
- No, I know.

17:38.871 --> 17:40.805
- Too many punches.
- It's all right.

17:40.873 --> 17:44.001
- I do better with birds.
- Come on.

17:47.380 --> 17:50.281
The F.B.I. Has now confirmed earlier reports...

17:50.349 --> 17:54.410
that the man abducted today
on East 10th Street was Bernard Kaiser...

17:54.487 --> 17:57.081
publisher of
American Business magazine...

17:57.156 --> 18:00.023
and that the Bureau
has taken control of the case.

18:00.092 --> 18:02.788
That's your team they're talkin' about there, uh,
Agent Sipowicz.

18:02.862 --> 18:04.796
Yeah, say good-bye
to Bernard Kaiser.

18:04.864 --> 18:07.332
You should've seen them come
sweepin'into Kaiser's office.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.493
Took our equipment off the phones
like we were janitors.

18:09.569 --> 18:12.003
The one thing those guys are good at:
Usin' their elbows.

18:12.071 --> 18:17.338
Well, my reason for optimism with the victim,
uh- the grab was fairly well executed...

18:17.410 --> 18:19.571
and the family is willing
to pay ransom.

18:19.645 --> 18:22.478
It's the F.B.I., Medavoy.
The guy croaks.

18:22.548 --> 18:27.110
Eh. Differing opinions.
That's why there's chocolate and vanilla.

18:27.186 --> 18:29.711
You wanna back up
that good feeling you got?

18:29.789 --> 18:32.280
- Mm?
- Amazing. Same when I was in Vice. Every time...

18:32.358 --> 18:35.054
we staked out O.T.B.,
guys wound up bettin'.

18:36.662 --> 18:38.687
Twenty buck mind bet,
the guy makes it.

18:40.099 --> 18:42.693
- A mind bet?
- An imaginary bet.

18:42.768 --> 18:45.293
How 'bout 50 actual dollars?

18:45.371 --> 18:51.310
All right. Twenty-five real dollars as-
as a vote against negative thinking.

18:58.551 --> 18:59.882
He spotted 'im.

19:08.828 --> 19:11.023
'Scuse me.
I'm lookin' for Wallin's pharmacy?

19:11.097 --> 19:13.031
- Nah, I don't know any-
- Around here somewhere?

19:13.099 --> 19:15.897
- No. No. Hey, what's goin' on?
- We're goin' for a ride.

19:15.968 --> 19:17.902
- Where we goin'?
- We're goin' to the station house.

19:17.970 --> 19:19.904
- Let me get my bet down.
- No.

19:19.972 --> 19:21.906
- Just do a mind bet.
- A what?

19:24.471 --> 19:28.840
- Yeah, he is. Okay.
- I had some bruise and battering, but I never once lost my teeth.

19:28.908 --> 19:31.741
- Thanks very much.
- I boxed Archie Moore.

19:31.811 --> 19:36.248
- I fought Harold Johnson- both title holders.
- Is that so?

19:36.316 --> 19:39.149
Lfhe thought he could make a buck...

19:39.219 --> 19:41.210
my manager'd put me in
against anybody.

19:41.287 --> 19:47.089
Archie Moore? Harold Johnson?
I weighed 154. They were light heavies.

19:47.160 --> 19:51.426
- Ah. I give Bobby his first bird.
- That's right.

19:51.498 --> 19:55.229
- Them birds keepin' you outta trouble, Bobby?
- Yeah, they are.

19:55.301 --> 19:59.032
Listen, um, that D.A. Is gonna come here
in a few minutes...

19:59.105 --> 20:01.130
to do that interview
for your release.

20:01.207 --> 20:03.141
- They gotta do that, huh?
- Yeah.

20:03.209 --> 20:05.336
- In this type of release, they- they got to.
- Bobby, uh...

20:05.412 --> 20:07.903
Hey, excuse me one minute, Patsy.

20:07.981 --> 20:10.814
This skell might have somethin'to do
with Kaiser gettin'grabbed.

20:10.884 --> 20:13.182
- You wanna be an F.B.I. Guy?
- I thought you were the F.B.I. Guy?

20:13.253 --> 20:16.017
With the other moron.
This guy already saw my shield.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.080
Yeah, all right.

20:20.293 --> 20:22.318
- Hey, Diane.
- Huh?

20:22.395 --> 20:24.955
- Patsy Ferrara.
- Who taught you birds?

20:25.031 --> 20:28.626
Yeah. He's, uh-
He's gettin' confused.

20:28.701 --> 20:33.729
I'm havin' Doc Mondzac come up here
to examine him. Patsy thinks Mondzac's a D.A.

20:33.807 --> 20:37.243
- Now I'm confused.
- Well, Patsy won't talk to doctors, right? So, uh...

20:37.310 --> 20:39.938
he got jammed up in the 64,
so I told him that the D. A...

20:40.013 --> 20:42.607
has to come up here to talk to him
before they let him go.

20:42.682 --> 20:44.616
- Can you do me a favor?
- Uh-huh.

20:44.684 --> 20:48.085
- Can you keep an eye on him until this doc comes up here?
- Yeah, sure.

20:48.154 --> 20:51.385
- I'd like to get to know him.
- Yeah, 'cause I gotta be an F.B.I. Agent for Andy.

20:51.458 --> 20:55.224
Patsy, I gotta do somethin' for a few minutes.
This is Detective Russell.

20:55.295 --> 20:58.856
- Diane. Pleased to meet you, Patsy.
- How do you do? Patsy Ferrara.

20:58.932 --> 21:01.833
Uh, Diane's gonna stay with you
for a while until, uh...

21:01.901 --> 21:03.835
D.A. Mondzac comes
and does this interview.

21:03.903 --> 21:06.701
- All right.
- Mm-hmm.

21:06.773 --> 21:11.676
- I'm just talkin' to this young lady here.
- Patsy fought Archie Moore.

21:11.744 --> 21:17.307
That D.A. I gotta talk to, uh-
is he a jerk?

21:17.383 --> 21:20.079
No. No, he's one of our best guys.

21:24.891 --> 21:26.825
- James Sampson-
- Robert Simone.

21:26.893 --> 21:31.057
- He's aware that this is a federal situation?
- This is so crazy.

21:31.131 --> 21:34.430
Our information is that you're connected
to the Kaiser abduction, James.

21:34.501 --> 21:38.699
I don't even know who that is.
I got seven dollars in my pocket.

21:38.771 --> 21:41.672
For God's sakes, I'm a clubfoot.
How am I gonna kidnap somebody?

21:41.741 --> 21:46.371
You know Steven Richards?

21:46.446 --> 21:50.678
- Son of a bitch. Steve Richards gave me to you guys?
- Why would he do that?

21:52.185 --> 21:55.154
All I did with Steve Richards
was buy a cell phone.

21:55.221 --> 21:57.553
Now what kinda trouble
is he tryin' to beat?

21:57.624 --> 22:01.082
- You made an abduction call off of that phone?
- I didn't make calls. I sold it.

22:01.161 --> 22:03.254
Was it a cloned phone?

22:04.330 --> 22:07.128
Yeah, it could've been.

22:07.200 --> 22:11.796
I sold it to a guy from O.T.B. -
a guy named Pete. I don't know his last name.

22:11.871 --> 22:14.396
- Is he there all the time?
- No, off and on.

22:14.474 --> 22:19.537
Uh, he said he was lookin' to buy a phone.
I knew Steve moved phones.

22:19.612 --> 22:23.480
I had a couple bucks in my pocket.
I figured I'd get in the middle.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.781
Lotta good it did me.
I tapped out at the Meadowlands.

22:26.853 --> 22:29.788
- You know what the stolen phone number was, James?
- I don't know dick.

22:29.856 --> 22:33.292
I bought the phone from Steve at the Greek's.
I sold it at the O.T.B.

22:33.359 --> 22:36.157
Ah, take off, Jimmy.

22:36.229 --> 22:39.596
You tell Steve he's a scumbag,
puttin' me in this type jackpot.

22:39.666 --> 22:42.464
Yeah, yeah.
He'll be filled with remorse.

22:45.471 --> 22:49.737
Somethin' in this, if I can get through
the manure in that Steve's head.

22:54.847 --> 22:56.781
Good night. Uh...

22:56.849 --> 23:00.250
you guys'll work liaison with the Bureau
tomorrow on that 9:00 ransom call?

23:00.320 --> 23:04.757
- Yeah, okay.
- Maybe we can detail their cars. How's it goin'?

23:04.891 --> 23:06.825
Hi.

23:06.893 --> 23:09.020
- Where's Patsy?
- Um, he left.

23:09.095 --> 23:11.791
- He left?
- I didn't wanna try to stop him, Bobby. He was really upset.

23:11.864 --> 23:15.356
- He made you for a doc?
- No. But he was very agitated and anxious.

23:15.435 --> 23:20.099
After we talked, he walked out. I'm afraid your
concerns about senility are probablyjustified.

23:20.173 --> 23:23.506
I found a way to have him try to tell me
the month, the president's name.

23:23.576 --> 23:26.636
- His short-term memory is definitely impaired.
- Oh, man.

23:26.713 --> 23:29.773
P.E.T. Scan of his brain
will give a definitive diagnosis...

23:29.849 --> 23:33.842
but as a practical matter, I think it's safe
to assume that it's early Alzheimer's.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.854
- All right. Thanks for comin' up, Doc.
- Sure.

23:35.922 --> 23:40.120
Look, this gerontologist at NYU
is doing some funded research.

23:40.193 --> 23:43.287
- Now, maybe Patsy can get in the program.
- Thanks a lot.

23:43.363 --> 23:46.230
- Sure. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

23:48.534 --> 23:51.503
Oh, tellJames Martinez hello.

23:51.571 --> 23:53.869
- Yeah, I will.
- Put some ice on that shoulder.

23:56.409 --> 23:59.970
Clean underwear tomorrow.
We're goin' to the Bureau.

24:00.046 --> 24:02.480
Yeah, Andy.
Good night, man.

24:02.548 --> 24:05.312
What's the matter
with your shoulder?

24:05.385 --> 24:10.413
- Uh, Patsy... repositioned me in the coffee room.
- He laid hands on you?

24:10.490 --> 24:13.015
Hejust moved me so he could get out.
He didn't mean any harm.

24:15.295 --> 24:17.820
I don't- I don't know what I'm gonna do
about this guy.

24:20.199 --> 24:23.691
People get old, Bobby.
They get sick.

24:30.109 --> 24:33.567
My dad wasn't really talkative, you know?

24:33.646 --> 24:36.547
I mean, he worked really hard, and...

24:36.616 --> 24:39.949
he'd come home after work, and...

24:40.019 --> 24:43.182
he'd always be fixin' things.

24:43.256 --> 24:47.420
Patsy, he, um- he'd been retired, like, 10 years
when I first started knowin' him.

24:47.493 --> 24:50.394
- Retired from fighting?
- Yeah. He had this job in the Parks Department.

24:50.463 --> 24:53.432
People would pull the slats
outta the concrete benches in the park...

24:53.499 --> 24:55.433
and the anchors,
they would come out too...

24:55.501 --> 24:57.765
- Mm.
- That held the wood to the concrete.

24:57.837 --> 25:00.397
Patsy is the guy
that would fix those anchors.

25:00.473 --> 25:04.466
I'd stand there, would hold the chisel for him,
and he would hammer in these new holes and...

25:04.544 --> 25:06.944
screw in those slats.

25:09.582 --> 25:14.986
He let me talk to him... all the time.
And he would talk back, you know?

25:16.522 --> 25:18.513
And then we'd have our sandwiches-
our lunch...

25:18.591 --> 25:21.287
and then afterwards,
when he was done...

25:21.361 --> 25:24.455
you know, we'd go up on the roof
and fly his birds.

25:28.534 --> 25:31.367
I just wish there was somethin'
I could do, you know?

25:37.410 --> 25:40.004
Let's go home.

25:49.088 --> 25:52.683
You know, he's gonna forget
he ever showed me those birds.

26:05.838 --> 26:09.433
All right.
Once the drop point's established...

26:09.509 --> 26:13.570
we'll deploy two-man units
along appropriate access points.

26:13.646 --> 26:15.978
- In addition-
- What was the beep?

26:16.048 --> 26:19.074
Martinez.
Him and Greg are bringin' Steve up.

26:19.152 --> 26:21.450
Our oversight will be discreet.

26:21.521 --> 26:25.252
Uh, local component
understand their roles?

26:25.324 --> 26:30.455
The subjects say they'll execute Kaiser
if they see one police helicopter or radio car.

26:30.530 --> 26:32.430
Here we go.

26:35.902 --> 26:38.666
Go ahead.

26:38.738 --> 26:41.298
Yes.

26:41.374 --> 26:44.969
Uh, y-yes, I have.

26:45.044 --> 26:47.342
1130.

26:47.413 --> 26:49.813
Uh, a-all right.
I can make that work.

26:49.882 --> 26:52.612
Uh, h-how will Mr. Kaiser be released?

26:54.086 --> 26:57.487
Is he safe? L-Is he in good cond...

26:57.557 --> 26:59.491
The drop's on the Triborough Bridge...

26:59.559 --> 27:02.357
At the Bronx Upstate
New York-bound toll plaza.

27:02.428 --> 27:05.625
There's a note with Kaiser's location
at the drop site. All right.

27:05.698 --> 27:09.327
Let's break down by teams.
We'll reconvene. Money team's here.

27:15.074 --> 27:17.008
Regular beehive.

27:18.010 --> 27:20.274
Andy.

27:26.886 --> 27:29.480
- Agent Sipowicz. How's it goin'?
- Where you been, Steve?

27:29.555 --> 27:33.889
Ate Thai food last night. Got food poisoning.
Thought it was curtains, man.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.155
- All this forJimmy Steps, all this activity?
- No, Steve.

27:36.229 --> 27:38.322
- Agent!
- It's not from Jimmy Steps.

27:38.397 --> 27:41.195
- Agent!
- You didn't hear that guy callin' from no pay phone, Steve.

27:41.267 --> 27:44.395
- What you did was sell him a phone with a cloned number.
- Oh, boy.

27:44.470 --> 27:48.270
This is one more chapter- how Steve
spends his life steppin' on his johnson.

27:48.341 --> 27:52.539
See, you could have earned on this.
All you had to do was tell us a straight story...

27:52.612 --> 27:54.910
- on how that phone was involved in the grab.
- I couldn't...

27:54.981 --> 27:57.916
- I couldn't give up my uncle. My uncle-
- Your uncle did the kidnapping?

27:57.984 --> 28:02.648
- No, he just... traffics somewhat in phones.
- Then shut up about your uncle.

28:02.722 --> 28:05.520
Steve, we need to know
how you knew...

28:05.591 --> 28:08.583
that the phone was bein' used
in the kidnapping, all right?

28:08.661 --> 28:10.720
I fabricated overhearin'Jimmy...

28:10.796 --> 28:14.391
'cause I was uncertain about particulars,
but I knew that phone was involved.

28:14.467 --> 28:18.426
- And I wanna know how.
- All right.

28:18.504 --> 28:21.496
- I'm at Our Lady, Queen of Peace
yesterday- the church? - Oh...

28:21.574 --> 28:24.407
I was. I was talkin' to Father DiLeo.
Two F.B.I. Guys come in, right?

28:24.477 --> 28:26.604
- They say they're tracin' a c-
- Psst. Psst.

28:33.052 --> 28:35.680
Tracin' a cell phone
that was registered to the parish.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.189
They say the ransom call
was made on that phone.

28:38.257 --> 28:41.385
You and your uncle cloned a priest's phone
and sold it to some skell?

28:41.460 --> 28:44.896
No harm to the father.
They don't charge you for fraudulent calls.

28:44.964 --> 28:50.368
Anyway, I'm watchin' TV, right, and I see on
the news, it's this big-shot guy that got grabbed...

28:50.436 --> 28:53.769
and I'm thinkin',
hey, you know, this is it.

28:53.839 --> 28:58.105
This is, you know, for one time in my life,
Steve Richards got a little- a little somethin'...

28:58.177 --> 29:01.078
which is, I know who had that phone,
which was Jimmy Steps.

29:01.147 --> 29:03.547
And now you're tellin'me
Steps sold it.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.880
You know a guy named Pete
from O.T. B?

29:05.952 --> 29:09.388
- Oh, Pete Bielski? That's who Steps sold it to?
- You know him?

29:09.455 --> 29:13.221
Well, yeah, um, no- no, you know,
he's not exactly a regular. I know him.

29:13.292 --> 29:15.817
- If you'll take your seats, please.
- Hey, Andy.

29:15.895 --> 29:18.557
- All right. Uh, run the guy through B.C.I.
- Pete Bielski?

29:18.631 --> 29:21.464
- Yeah.
- If that zeroes out, take Steve over to the O.T.B.

29:21.534 --> 29:23.525
- See ifhe can pick him out.
- Yeah, okay. Let's go, Steve.

29:23.603 --> 29:27.164
I'm surprised Pete's involved.
He's wrapped up pretty tight, Detective.

29:27.239 --> 29:31.733
- Uh, Agent Sipowicz, I'm still in line for compensation, right?
- Come on. Let's go, all right?

29:32.812 --> 29:36.304
Depends,
if they count on brain death.

29:52.898 --> 29:55.867
- A hell of a setup, isn't it?
- You get the out-of-town ball games on this thing?

29:55.935 --> 30:00.668
There's a car approaching.
Looks like it could be our guy.

30:00.740 --> 30:02.674
- I'm opening the trunk-
- Here we go.

30:02.742 --> 30:04.835
- Getting the suitcases.
- All right. This is it.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.976
Here we go.
Stand by all units.

30:12.051 --> 30:15.543
I'm putting the suitcases
into his trunk now.

30:17.890 --> 30:20.484
What the hell?

30:20.559 --> 30:23.187
- He's makin' a U-turn!
- I'm switching to southbound camera, lane eight.

30:23.262 --> 30:26.993
He's headed back the other way
towards the toll booth! Who we got southbound?

30:28.734 --> 30:32.693
- Look at this. Look at this.
- Repeating: Subject's headed southbound.

30:32.772 --> 30:35.400
Can you get us a license plate number
on that subject vehicle?

30:35.474 --> 30:39.535
Yeah. Uh,
New York plates, MED-751.

30:39.612 --> 30:44.049
Repeating: Michael, Eddie, David, 751.

30:44.116 --> 30:48.815
All right. Initiate a pursuit.
Available units to respond. Southbound.

30:48.888 --> 30:50.753
That tag number's been out of use
for five years.

30:50.823 --> 30:53.348
You got somebody pickin' 'em up southbound?

30:53.426 --> 30:56.088
All right. Raise your local P.D. Units
for a southbound pursuit.

30:56.162 --> 30:58.892
It'll take 'em a few minutes.
They're clear of the area.

30:58.964 --> 31:01.728
Yeah, we didn't want to put
the victim in jeopardy.

31:01.801 --> 31:03.962
Units four and five
going through toll plaza now.

31:04.036 --> 31:06.402
- Do you have an eyeball on them?
- No, we don't.

31:15.381 --> 31:19.215
- Put the bullet right here. It's the humane thing to do.
- How do you get the heat?

31:19.285 --> 31:22.880
It's the F.B.I. 's screwup. All we could do
was stand around scratchin'our nuts.

31:22.955 --> 31:28.086
Why did we give it up to the F.B. I?
Gotta be a fall guy for that, right? Hmm.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.856
- No word on the victim? No message where to find him?
- Nothin'.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.421
We might have a lead on the cell phone
used for the ransom call.

31:33.499 --> 31:37.731
- How live?
- It's a cloned phone. There's the hump that sold it.

31:37.803 --> 31:40.499
We think it got moved to the kidnappers
a couple of skells down.

31:40.573 --> 31:43.098
Yeah, so far we got it traced
to a Pete Bielski.

31:43.175 --> 31:46.736
Uh, B.C.I. Kicked him out with two collars.
Uh, we got his address from the D.M. V.

31:46.812 --> 31:50.248
- Roust him.
- We gotta notify the F.B. I?

31:51.617 --> 31:53.710
Screw the F.B.I.

31:57.156 --> 31:59.590
- Martinez-
- Hey, sit still, Steve.

31:59.658 --> 32:01.592
- Just wanted to-
- Just sit down.

32:01.660 --> 32:06.256
- Agent Sipowicz, any word?
- We're gonna try to grab Bielski at his place. If he's not there...

32:06.332 --> 32:08.823
- you're gonna help us look for him at O. T.B.
- Oh, that's no problem.

32:08.901 --> 32:11.836
- I cleared my calendar.
- Any idea if he carries a gun?

32:11.904 --> 32:13.838
Well, that really wouldn't be my impression.

32:13.906 --> 32:16.397
Uh, thumbnail?
I'd describe Pete as cautious, nervous...

32:16.475 --> 32:19.467
- you know, a careful-type person.
- Go back and sit down.

32:21.413 --> 32:23.779
Detective Simone,
a Fat Mike called.

32:23.849 --> 32:27.842
- He said to tell you that Patsy hadn't come to work.
- All right. Thanks, Donna.

32:27.920 --> 32:31.651
- Poor man, huh? He's gettin' confused.
- Yeah.

32:43.235 --> 32:45.169
Over here.

32:50.943 --> 32:52.877
Pete!

32:52.945 --> 32:56.711
- Yeah?
- New York City Police.

32:56.782 --> 32:59.307
New York City Police, huh?

33:05.457 --> 33:07.982
- You Pete Bielski?
- Yeah. You wouldn't want the wrong guy.

33:08.060 --> 33:10.290
- Anybody else livin'here?
- No.

33:10.362 --> 33:14.890
All right. Relax, Pete.
We're gonna take you down to the station house.

33:14.967 --> 33:17.697
- We wanna talk to you about a few things, all right?
- Nope. Nope.

33:17.770 --> 33:20.705
- Screw you guys.
- Oh, good. That's a good opening attitude, Pete.

33:20.773 --> 33:22.331
- Come on. Let's go.
- No! I said, no!

33:22.408 --> 33:26.208
- Hey.
- Look, I wouldn't say anything. You don't believe that?

33:26.278 --> 33:30.715
- Then do it here.
- We'll tell you where this conversation is gonna be, okay?

33:30.783 --> 33:33.752
Yeah?
LikeJersey, and I wind up in the weeds?

33:35.921 --> 33:37.320
- Here.
- Hey!

33:37.389 --> 33:40.256
It's not a gun.

33:42.628 --> 33:47.691
That's the 2,800. Now, I keep my mouth shut,
and I don't want the money.

33:47.766 --> 33:52.669
Otherwise, do it here,
and tell those bastards to go screw themselves.

33:52.738 --> 33:54.672
- You think we're gonna shoot you.
- Yeah.

33:54.740 --> 33:58.870
Well, who do you think sent us to shoot you, Pete?
Those guys you sold that phone to, right?

33:58.944 --> 34:00.912
Because you can put them
with the kidnap.

34:00.980 --> 34:04.438
Look, just stop messing with my head, all right?

34:05.718 --> 34:08.708
- Just do what you gotta do.
- Pete, hello?

34:08.841 --> 34:11.639
We are the cops, okay?

34:21.320 --> 34:23.288
- You guys are really cops?
- Yeah...

34:23.356 --> 34:27.793
and we're lookin' for a real guy- got grabbed-
before he turns up really dead.

34:27.860 --> 34:31.591
All right? So let's go over
to our real station house, okay, Pete? Come on.

34:31.664 --> 34:34.360
Thank God.
I thought you guys were here to kill me.

34:34.433 --> 34:36.731
You get that feelin' a lot, huh?

34:42.608 --> 34:45.371
Some situation, huh, Pete?

34:45.444 --> 34:47.378
Go away, Steve.

34:47.446 --> 34:50.347
Hopin' he recognizes someone-
kidnappers.

34:50.416 --> 34:52.509
Go away.

34:52.585 --> 34:55.748
Offhand, Detective, Pete comin'
involved in your misdemeanor...

34:55.821 --> 34:58.688
does that disqualify him
from reward eligibility?

34:58.758 --> 35:03.525
If we don't find the guy alive, Steve, I wouldn't
expect too many rewards to be passed out.

35:03.596 --> 35:07.191
Oh, absolutely,
'cause, uh, live rescue's our first priority.

35:07.266 --> 35:10.861
First priority, gentlemen:
Live rescue.

35:10.937 --> 35:13.462
Why weren't we notified
you were moving on a suspect?

35:13.539 --> 35:15.905
Did you bring the personnel photos
from Kaiser's company?

35:15.975 --> 35:19.809
We want to talk to the suspect at our office.
He can look at the photos there.

35:19.879 --> 35:23.508
- I can't believe this.
- You people blow the money transfer...

35:23.583 --> 35:27.349
God only knows what condition the victim's in,
or ifhe's even still alive...

35:27.420 --> 35:31.083
This is our case. Do I have to call
the U.S. Attorney to get the suspect turned over?

35:31.157 --> 35:34.888
- You want the U.S. Attorney?
- Dial nine for an outside line.

35:34.961 --> 35:38.522
- Lieu?
- It's okay.

35:38.598 --> 35:41.726
- We got the dump on Bielski's home phone.
- Come on.

35:45.137 --> 35:48.368
Bielski says these guys did call him
between 8:30 and 9:00 three nights ago.

35:48.441 --> 35:52.275
Phone log has two incoming calls
around that time: One's from his mother...

35:52.345 --> 35:54.836
other one's from a pay phone
outside an army post in Suffolk.

35:54.914 --> 35:57.280
The post is abandoned.

35:57.350 --> 35:59.944
- Let's take a look.
- We're gonna drive out there with you, Lieutenant.

36:00.019 --> 36:03.546
You don't wanna work out
who's gonna lead the caravan?

36:19.038 --> 36:22.235
- Lieu, that's the money car.
- Check it out.

36:27.747 --> 36:30.841
A couple of you guys,
see if you can get around the other side.

36:50.903 --> 36:55.363
Lieu, this food is fresh.

36:58.911 --> 37:00.902
Help me!

37:02.048 --> 37:05.279
Let me out!

37:05.351 --> 37:07.945
Help me!

37:15.227 --> 37:17.593
Help! I'm down here.

37:19.432 --> 37:22.595
- Help me!
- Help me move this.

37:22.668 --> 37:25.000
I'm in here!

37:34.180 --> 37:36.171
We need the cuff key.

37:38.017 --> 37:40.008
- Bernard Kaiser?
- Yes.

37:40.086 --> 37:42.554
Here we go.
You all right?

37:42.621 --> 37:45.021
- Yeah, I think so.
- Can you get up?

37:45.091 --> 37:48.424
- Mr. Kaiser- thank God.
- Can you stand?

37:48.494 --> 37:52.794
Here you go.

37:52.865 --> 37:58.360
- Fan out. Check out the rest of the building.
- It was Kerry and Edmonds.

37:58.437 --> 38:01.565
- Did you- Did you pay the ransom?
- Yes, sir! We did.

38:01.640 --> 38:04.575
Then they're gonna be in Bimini.

38:04.643 --> 38:08.841
- Let's get you outta here.
- Ho-ho, brilliant.

38:08.914 --> 38:11.644
Clean getaway
to a place got no extradition.

38:11.717 --> 38:14.345
Bureau's got 'em lulled
into a false sense of security.

38:14.420 --> 38:17.150
- Get outta my face.
- Now you put a field operation together:

38:17.223 --> 38:20.556
Some paratroopers,
couple dozen rough terrain vehicles...

38:20.626 --> 38:25.086
- Get away from me.
- AWACS, spy planes...

38:36.442 --> 38:38.933
Hello. Congratulations.
Desk sergeant told me victim's alive.

38:39.011 --> 38:40.672
- Congratulations. Wonderful job.
- That's right.

38:40.746 --> 38:42.236
- Mr. Kaiser's safe, right?
- Yeah.

38:42.314 --> 38:43.906
- Okay!
- Do me a favor, Steve, you know?

38:43.983 --> 38:45.917
- Sit down?
- Right here. Good job.

38:45.985 --> 38:48.283
- You're gonna hyperventilate.
- He's safe, right? Everything's good.

38:48.354 --> 38:50.845
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

38:50.923 --> 38:52.857
- Victim's safe. Wonderful job.
- Thanks, Steve.

38:52.925 --> 38:55.723
Wonderful job.
Wonderful job.

38:55.795 --> 39:00.459
Oh, Agent, um-
Are you an agent or a detective? 'Cause...

39:00.533 --> 39:03.093
- I may have misled you a little there, Steve.
- Well, that's no problem.

39:03.169 --> 39:06.138
- Whatever your personal joke-
- Well, I'm very relieved to hear you say that.

39:06.205 --> 39:08.139
Well, I just hope, uh, you know...

39:08.207 --> 39:12.735
a reward wasn't humorous, you know-
some aspect of a reward- Um, excuse me, sir.

39:12.812 --> 39:14.939
- How are you? How you doin'?
- Good.

39:15.014 --> 39:19.610
Um, we haven't had any really specific contact,
although I do recognize your authority...

39:19.685 --> 39:21.175
- from, you know, Donna, so forth.
- Yeah.

39:21.253 --> 39:22.743
- Steve Richards. How are ya?
- How you doin'?

39:22.822 --> 39:24.756
Pleasure. Pleasure.
Curiosity on my part:

39:24.824 --> 39:27.725
Just naturally, uh, you know,
where my information was central...

39:27.793 --> 39:31.957
- You were involved with this case?
- Oh, God, yes. Yes, centrally...

39:32.031 --> 39:35.694
and if I can just find out, you know,
where I stand in terms of, you know, um...

39:35.768 --> 39:37.759
I'm feeling somewhat light-headed.

39:37.837 --> 39:41.102
I really... don't know when I've dined last.
I just, you know- general curiosity...

39:41.173 --> 39:43.403
Forty grand.

39:43.476 --> 39:46.070
Forty grand? Forty...

39:46.145 --> 39:48.136
Get outta town.
Forty grand for me?

39:48.214 --> 39:50.239
I don't know.
Maybe they were kiddin'.

39:50.316 --> 39:52.807
Kidding?

39:52.885 --> 39:56.252
- Nah, it's real.
- You're ki- It's real?

39:58.924 --> 40:03.793
M- m-mm-wah! God bless you, and this country.
Oh! That's all I have to say.

40:03.863 --> 40:06.127
- Forty thousand!
- Don't ever kiss me again, Steve.

40:06.198 --> 40:08.462
- I won't. I can't believe this.
- Steve, come here.

40:08.534 --> 40:10.832
- Yes.
- Get on the other side of the gate here.

40:10.903 --> 40:13.997
- Oh!
- Call this guy Crawford about the reward.

40:14.073 --> 40:16.337
- All right?
- Yeah. Yes.

40:16.408 --> 40:21.038
I'm rich.

40:23.782 --> 40:26.046
- Can I use this phone, please?
- Mm-hmm.

40:26.118 --> 40:28.313
- Get yourself together.
- Nice goin', guys.

40:28.387 --> 40:31.686
- Yeah, worked out good, right?
- Listen, uh, I got the five, if you wanna take off.

40:31.757 --> 40:34.157
- Hey, thanks.
- Patsy Ferrara stopped by.

40:34.226 --> 40:36.057
Oh, yeah?
Did he apologize to you?

40:36.128 --> 40:41.031
I don't think he even remembered what happened.
But, um, said he had a bird for you.

40:42.668 --> 40:45.967
Gimme a second.

40:46.038 --> 40:49.906
Yeah, so, may I ask, is that-
is that reportable income? Uh-huh.

40:49.975 --> 40:51.909
- Great job, Andy.
- Yeah, thanks.

40:51.977 --> 40:53.911
- Yeah, yeah. Good work.
- Yeah.

40:53.979 --> 40:56.140
Hey, Andy?

41:01.153 --> 41:04.645
So, I told ya I h-h-had a feelin',
didn't I, Andy...

41:04.723 --> 41:07.749
- that- that the- the guy'd survive?
- Yeah, that's right.

41:07.826 --> 41:12.661
So, uh, with him surviving-
you know, like I predicted- um...

41:12.731 --> 41:15.825
W- We made that bet, right, Andy?

41:15.901 --> 41:20.031
Wai-Wai-Wait. Wait a second, Medavoy.
You're sayin', I helped effect the rescue...

41:20.105 --> 41:22.596
of this hostage,
and in so doing, it cost me 25 bucks?

41:22.675 --> 41:25.235
- That's how you think it should go? Huh?
- Andy, Andy...

41:25.311 --> 41:28.246
- Huh? - You knew you caught the
case wh-when you made the bet.

41:28.314 --> 41:30.544
Am I wrong?

41:30.616 --> 41:33.016
- Tell me if I'm wrong.
- I gotta go.

41:33.085 --> 41:36.145
- Later, guys.
- Night.

41:36.221 --> 41:38.246
- You're absolutely right, Medavoy.
- Yeah.

41:38.324 --> 41:41.452
I mean, you know, i-if it had went the other way,
I'd have definitely paid the debt.

41:41.527 --> 41:44.496
- You got any money?
- Excuse me. One second.

41:44.563 --> 41:47.031
- You got $25?
- Detective, please.

41:47.099 --> 41:50.500
If 25 bucks you think is all you're gettin',
wait till that reward money comes through.

41:50.569 --> 41:53.129
- I can't take reward money.
- Oh. Well...

41:53.205 --> 41:57.107
um, I don't have any actual currency
on my person at this time.

41:57.176 --> 42:00.304
- Maybe two somethin'or 2.40, maybe.
- Uh-huh.

42:00.379 --> 42:04.110
Wait. I'm gonna write you the biggest I.O.U.
You've ever laid eyes on.

42:04.183 --> 42:07.641
- Where's the biggest sheet of paper you got?
- Take this money, Medavoy...

42:07.720 --> 42:12.214
purchase some Preparation H, and I want you
to shove the change up your tushie.

42:12.291 --> 42:14.225
Thanks, Andy.

42:16.528 --> 42:18.462
Napkin.

42:19.798 --> 42:24.428
Steve Richards owes Detective Sip"...

42:25.504 --> 42:27.972
How would you spell Sipowicz"?

42:28.040 --> 42:30.406
S- I...

42:30.476 --> 42:33.001
I'll just wing it.
P"...

42:46.525 --> 42:49.050
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hey, what's goin' on, Patsy?

42:49.128 --> 42:51.892
I was at your work today.
Did they tell ya?

42:52.965 --> 42:54.956
Yeah.

42:56.802 --> 42:58.736
You talked to this detective here.

42:58.804 --> 43:00.999
- How are ya, Miss?
- Hello, Patsy.

43:01.073 --> 43:04.873
- Patsy, you laid hands on Detective Russell.
- What?

43:04.943 --> 43:06.877
You remember that?

43:06.945 --> 43:09.106
Well, I apologize then.
I'm sorry.

43:09.181 --> 43:13.481
- All right, Patsy.
- Surprised at myself.

43:15.788 --> 43:18.689
Why don't you give me the keys. I'll go up.
Patsy, I'll talk to you later.

43:18.757 --> 43:21.749
- It's a pretty bird.
- Yeah.

43:25.664 --> 43:30.192
Yeah. I brought this over.
Bobby, is- is this your bird?

43:30.269 --> 43:32.737
- Nah. Uh-uh.
- Come home with my flock.

43:32.805 --> 43:36.502
- It's got no band on it or nothin'. I thought maybe it's yours.
- Nope.

43:38.577 --> 43:41.341
Gotta face some facts here, Patsy.

43:41.413 --> 43:45.213
- You're forgetful now. That's just true.
- Ah.

43:45.284 --> 43:49.721
You know, and this doctor that I was tellin'
you about, he'd be willin' to work with you.

43:49.788 --> 43:51.983
I got no money for doctors.

43:52.057 --> 43:55.322
It's a program over at NYU, Patsy. I don't think
you're gonna have to pay for anything.

43:55.394 --> 43:59.023
The hell with that, Bobby.
I know what goes on in them places.

43:59.098 --> 44:02.590
Patsy, this is happenin' whether
you admit it or not. Now we oughta just face...

44:02.668 --> 44:05.728
that fact and then find out
what we can do about it.

44:07.740 --> 44:09.401
I'm gonna make that appointment for you.

44:13.412 --> 44:16.575
Well-
Yeah, you probably better.

44:16.648 --> 44:20.482
And then, you know, we start makin' lists,
you know, of places you gotta be.

44:20.552 --> 44:23.544
- Geez.
- W-We'll buy alarms, and...

44:33.031 --> 44:35.795
Time flies, huh?

44:37.503 --> 44:39.994
And the birds fly.

44:48.213 --> 44:50.977
He'll be home before I will.

44:52.785 --> 44:55.618
Remember I taught you that?

44:59.992 --> 45:02.392
I remember everything, Patsy.

45:04.830 --> 45:07.628
I'm gonna go home.

45:07.699 --> 45:10.395
All right.
I'll come by and see you tomorrow.

45:10.469 --> 45:13.199
Okay.
I'll be at Fat Mike's.

45:13.272 --> 45:15.263
Okay, Patsy.
