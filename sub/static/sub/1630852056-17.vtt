WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:02.367
You had a close
relationship with your mother.

00:02.433 --> 00:03.467
-Yes.
-[sobs]

00:03.533 --> 00:05.033
[Judy] At some point,
your daughter-in-law

00:05.100 --> 00:07.333
filed a restraining order against you.

00:09.967 --> 00:11.467
You have two children together.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.400
Yes, ma'am.

00:12.467 --> 00:14.100
Clearly, your child
had a relationship

00:14.166 --> 00:15.800
with his grandmother.

00:15.867 --> 00:18.567
You should find a way
of making sure

00:18.633 --> 00:20.700
that that relationship continues.

[Kevin] All rise.
Court, come to order.

00:53.767 --> 00:56.734
Morning. Morning.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.600
Have a seat, please.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.066
-[Kevin] Good morning, Judge.
-[Judy] Morning.

01:00.133 --> 01:02.500
Case number 1053,
Gilbert versus Gilbert.

01:02.567 --> 01:04.800
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:04.867 --> 01:06.533
[Judy] Mrs. Gilbert,
this is your son?

01:06.600 --> 01:08.367
-Correct.
-[Judy] And the young lady

01:08.433 --> 01:09.633
with him is his wife?

01:09.700 --> 01:11.100
-Correct.
-[Judy] This is your claim:

01:11.166 --> 01:13.266
There was a time
that there was some

01:13.333 --> 01:15.834
domestic difficulty
in your son's home.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.100
At that time, he came
to live with you.

01:18.166 --> 01:19.400
You claim
that during that time,

01:19.467 --> 01:21.767
you made a loan to him
for an attorney.

01:21.834 --> 01:24.266
-Correct.
-[Judy] And also extended

01:24.333 --> 01:26.600
another loan for him for a car.

01:26.667 --> 01:28.266
-Correct.
-[Judy] Your son and his wife

01:28.333 --> 01:30.033
ultimately reconciled.

01:30.100 --> 01:33.333
And you claim he stopped
paying on the initial loan

01:33.400 --> 01:35.200
for an attorney and the car
all together.

01:35.266 --> 01:36.200
Correct.

01:36.266 --> 01:37.700
[Judy] You also claim
that at some point,

01:37.767 --> 01:40.867
your daughter-in-law filed
a restraining order against you?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.500
-[Dawn] Correct.
-[Judy] A restraining order

01:42.567 --> 01:44.300
that the allegations were false,

01:44.367 --> 01:46.667
and she didn't show up
at the hearing,

01:46.734 --> 01:47.967
and that was dismissed.

01:48.033 --> 01:49.166
-Correct.
-[Judy] Okay.

01:49.233 --> 01:51.166
So I'm gonna start with you,
Mr. Gilbert.

01:51.233 --> 01:52.834
When were you
and your wife married?

01:52.900 --> 01:56.266
We got married,
uh, November 4th of 2019.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.467
And you have children
together?

01:57.533 --> 01:58.467
-Yes, ma'am.
-Two?

01:58.533 --> 01:59.500
-Yup.
-[Judy] How old are they?

01:59.567 --> 02:01.066
My oldest son is four.

02:01.133 --> 02:02.633
Uh, little girl
that just turned one.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.166
So, I gather
that you and your wife

02:05.233 --> 02:07.834
were in a relationship
well before you married,

02:07.900 --> 02:09.100
if you have a four-year-old?

02:09.166 --> 02:10.667
How long have you been
living together?

02:10.734 --> 02:12.633
Uh, we've been living together
for about six years now.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.567
Have you been living
together independently,

02:14.633 --> 02:16.066
on your own,
in your own home?

02:16.133 --> 02:17.033
Yes.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.834
[Judy] In what month and year
did you and your wife separate?

02:19.900 --> 02:22.233
Um, as far as
after we were married,

02:22.300 --> 02:25.367
we separated January of 2021.

02:25.433 --> 02:27.533
When you and your wife
separated, where did you go?

02:27.600 --> 02:30.166
I went to stay with my mother
for a brief period

02:30.233 --> 02:32.400
until I was able to find
something in town.

02:32.467 --> 02:34.667
Give me the date that you went
to live with your mother.

02:34.734 --> 02:36.834
It would have been
the first week of February.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.000
How long did you stay there?

02:38.066 --> 02:40.300
I was there
probably about four days.

02:40.367 --> 02:41.500
-[Judy] Four days.
-Yes, ma'am.

02:41.567 --> 02:43.166
While you were
with your mother,

02:43.233 --> 02:46.533
and I assume that the separation
with your wife

02:46.600 --> 02:48.233
was not an amicable one.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.166
Correct.

02:49.233 --> 02:51.867
You had two children.
Were you seeing your children?

02:51.934 --> 02:53.734
When I first separated, yes.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.467
Thereafter,
about two months, no.

02:55.533 --> 02:57.033
-[Judy] Why?
-There was a restraining order

02:57.100 --> 02:59.133
that was put against me
from my wife.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.300
[Judy]
So, for the first two months,

03:00.367 --> 03:02.333
everything was okay,
and you saw your children?

03:02.400 --> 03:03.533
Yep.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.133
[Judy] Not "yep".
"Yep" is not an answer.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.467
-"Yes" is an answer.
-Yes.

03:06.533 --> 03:10.533
And what did your wife
allege in the restraining order?

03:10.600 --> 03:11.800
That I was stalking her.

03:11.867 --> 03:13.166
-[Judy] Were you?
-No.

03:13.233 --> 03:14.934
Did she withdraw
the restraining order?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.166
-Yes.
-How much after she filed it?

03:17.233 --> 03:19.333
I had to actually get a lawyer

03:19.400 --> 03:21.800
in order to get
the restraining order removed.

03:21.867 --> 03:22.867
You went to a hearing?

03:22.934 --> 03:23.967
Yes.

03:24.033 --> 03:26.000
And was the restraining order
denied?

03:26.066 --> 03:28.100
-[Nathan] Yes.
-So, the lawyer was helpful?

03:28.166 --> 03:29.266
-Yes.
-[Judy] Did your mother

03:29.333 --> 03:31.266
-give you money for the lawyer?
-Yes.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.500
[Judy] Now, at that time,
you were living on your own?

03:33.567 --> 03:34.500
Correct.

03:34.567 --> 03:36.100
So, you had to have gone
to your mother

03:36.166 --> 03:38.400
and let her know that you had
this restraining order in place?

03:38.467 --> 03:39.567
Yes.

03:39.633 --> 03:41.533
Do you remember
on what date you were served

03:41.600 --> 03:42.900
with a restraining order?

03:42.967 --> 03:44.867
Uh, the second week of February.

03:44.934 --> 03:48.367
[Judy] I'm confused.
You said you separated,

03:48.433 --> 03:50.734
and you went to live
with your mother

03:50.800 --> 03:52.700
around the first week
in February.

03:52.767 --> 03:53.700
Yep.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.500
-[Judy] "Yep" is not an answer.
-Yes.

03:55.567 --> 03:58.900
And I asked you about
visitation after you separated,

03:58.967 --> 04:01.233
and you said the first two months
were okay.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.367
That would be
February and March?

04:03.433 --> 04:04.400
Correct.

04:04.467 --> 04:05.767
But you just said
you were served

04:05.834 --> 04:08.867
with the restraining order
the second week in February.

04:08.934 --> 04:09.967
Correct.

04:10.033 --> 04:12.934
[Judy] Well, did the restraining
order stop visitation?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.066
No.

04:14.133 --> 04:15.767
Okay, so the restraining order,

04:15.834 --> 04:17.700
you continued
to see the children?

04:17.767 --> 04:19.300
-[Nathan] Yes.
-[Judy] Until what date?

04:19.367 --> 04:21.567
Would have been
end of February.

04:21.633 --> 04:23.333
Well, that's just
a couple of weeks.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.600
-[Nathan] Yes.
-[Judy] So, you were mistaken?

04:25.667 --> 04:27.300
-Yes.
-Did you have a hearing

04:27.367 --> 04:28.600
at the end of February?

04:28.667 --> 04:30.266
-No.
-Well, you're gonna have to

04:30.333 --> 04:32.166
explain that to me, Mr. Gilbert.

04:32.233 --> 04:34.467
If she filed
a restraining order

04:34.533 --> 04:36.200
the second week in February...

04:36.266 --> 04:37.567
Is that when you filed it?

04:37.633 --> 04:38.967
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes.

04:39.033 --> 04:41.700
And usually when you file
a restraining order,

04:41.767 --> 04:42.967
you appear before a judge.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.433
Did you appear before a judge?

04:44.500 --> 04:45.433
Yes, ma'am.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.300
[Judy] And did you ask that
your husband stay away from you?

04:48.367 --> 04:49.300
Yes, ma'am.

04:49.367 --> 04:50.266
[Judy] And the children?

04:50.333 --> 04:51.266
No, ma'am.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.000
-[Judy] Not the children?
-Not the children.

04:53.066 --> 04:56.266
So, when the restraining
order was first issued,

04:56.333 --> 04:58.033
it was just
staying away from you?

04:58.100 --> 04:58.934
Yes, ma'am.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.800
When did you change that
and request

05:00.867 --> 05:02.400
that he stay away
from the children?

05:02.467 --> 05:05.567
I did not request that he
stay away from the children, um,

05:05.633 --> 05:07.000
because we have children
together.

05:07.066 --> 05:08.233
It's not my,
our children's fault.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.800
[Judy] Just-just a second.

05:09.867 --> 05:12.967
Well, your husband says
that it became difficult for him

05:13.033 --> 05:14.467
to see his children.

05:14.533 --> 05:16.533
And I want to know
when that was

05:16.600 --> 05:20.100
because I have to figure
this lawyer business out.

05:20.166 --> 05:22.300
When and under what
circumstances

05:22.367 --> 05:25.033
did it become difficult
for him to see his children?

05:25.100 --> 05:26.467
It was the month of March.

05:26.533 --> 05:30.500
Um, he and I were having
some disagreements and arguments

05:30.567 --> 05:32.166
that was really frustrating me.

05:32.233 --> 05:35.533
I was obviously a single mom
at that point in time.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.266
And I just needed
some time away from him

05:38.333 --> 05:40.000
and get the kids together

05:40.066 --> 05:43.166
so that way the kids
cannot see Mom so upset.

05:43.233 --> 05:45.400
So, I stopped
letting them see him

05:45.467 --> 05:46.667
because it was upsetting me

05:46.734 --> 05:48.900
with how much my son
was asking about his dad

05:48.967 --> 05:51.300
and how much
he missed his-his dad.

05:51.367 --> 05:52.266
And so eventually,

05:52.333 --> 05:54.467
we just kind of came
to an agreement on things.

05:54.533 --> 05:57.066
Well, you didn't come
to an agreement on things.

05:57.133 --> 06:00.133
Mr. Gilbert, did you agree
not to see the children?

06:00.200 --> 06:02.166
-No.
-[Judy] So, you must have asked

06:02.233 --> 06:04.900
for a modification
of the restraining order?

06:04.967 --> 06:05.934
It was dropped.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.166
Well, was it dropped
in March?

06:08.233 --> 06:09.600
Uh, it was dropped at the,

06:09.667 --> 06:13.233
completely by the end
of February, I believe, totally.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.100
Well, I want to know why it is
he wasn't seeing his chil--?

06:16.166 --> 06:18.100
Did you agree
not to see your children?

06:18.166 --> 06:19.700
No, I was trying to,

06:19.767 --> 06:21.033
the way I was
seeing the children

06:21.100 --> 06:22.433
was through her mother.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.767
And after a period of time,

06:23.834 --> 06:26.033
her mother was not
answering any questions

06:26.100 --> 06:27.900
as far as when I would
be able to see them,

06:27.967 --> 06:29.767
when I could pick them up,
so on and so forth.

06:29.834 --> 06:32.133
So, that's when you decided
to retain an attorney?

06:32.200 --> 06:33.400
-Yes.
-[Judy] In March?

06:33.467 --> 06:35.100
-Yes.
-Now I'm getting the picture.

06:35.166 --> 06:37.300
So, the two of you
weren't talking.

06:37.367 --> 06:39.033
You were talking
through an intermediary.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.934
The intermediary was her mother.

06:41.000 --> 06:41.934
Correct.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.100
[Judy] Her mother stopped
responding to your calls

06:44.166 --> 06:47.033
to see the children,
which is when you--

06:47.100 --> 06:48.467
-Retained the attorney.
-[Judy] --retained an attorney.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.100
So that's when
you went to your mother.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.100
-[Nathan] Mm-hm.
-Because you didn't have money?

06:52.166 --> 06:53.300
-[Nathan] Right.
-[Judy] And I'd like you

06:53.367 --> 06:55.934
to tell me what the conversation
was with your mother.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.500
I went to my mother,
I explained to her

06:57.567 --> 06:59.767
as far as a retainer fee
was required--

06:59.834 --> 07:02.066
No, tell me
what you said to her,

07:02.133 --> 07:04.333
and what she said to you.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.967
"I went to my mom's house,
and I told her--"

07:08.033 --> 07:09.467
Tell me what you told her.

07:09.533 --> 07:10.467
I told her
that I haven't been able

07:10.533 --> 07:12.266
to see the babies,
and I need to get a lawyer

07:12.333 --> 07:14.467
to get something going
so I can see my children.

07:14.533 --> 07:15.834
And what did she say to you?

07:15.900 --> 07:17.166
She said
that she could help me out.

07:17.233 --> 07:18.800
But she didn't have
the full 1,500,

07:18.867 --> 07:20.000
-in which case I--
-You told her

07:20.066 --> 07:22.000
it was 1,500 doll--
the retainer was

07:22.066 --> 07:23.433
-1,500 dollars?
-Correct. Yep.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.667
[Judy] How much
did she say she had?

07:24.734 --> 07:26.066
She did not have all of it.

07:26.133 --> 07:28.100
Um, she could come up
with about 1,100,

07:28.166 --> 07:30.033
in which case the rest
came out of my pocket.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.266
Okay, so she handed you
1,100 dollars?

07:33.333 --> 07:34.834
Um, I gave her the cash.

07:34.900 --> 07:37.433
And then we went down
to the lawyer my next day off

07:37.500 --> 07:39.200
to get the ball rolling.

07:39.266 --> 07:41.333
You mean, you gave your mother
400 dollars.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.333
Correct.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.200
[Judy] And she wrote a check
to the lawyer?

07:44.266 --> 07:46.100
Uh, uh, debit card, yes.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.467
-[Judy] Mrs. Gilbert?
-Yes.

07:47.533 --> 07:50.100
[Judy] Is it correct
that he put in 400,

07:50.166 --> 07:51.266
you put in 1,100?

07:51.333 --> 07:55.033
[Dawn] Yes, it was actually
458, to be exact.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.633
And I just paid it
on my debit card,

07:56.700 --> 07:58.800
the total 1,500.

07:58.867 --> 08:01.400
Okay, but he gave you 458?

08:01.467 --> 08:06.166
Correct. I'm sorry, it was 468. I'm sorry.

08:06.233 --> 08:10.367
Okay. So, let's finish off
this attorney piece

08:10.433 --> 08:11.867
before we get to the car piece.

08:11.934 --> 08:12.867
[theme music]

08:12.934 --> 08:14.800
You know,
controlling children,

08:14.867 --> 08:17.834
which is clearly something
that happened with your husband,

08:17.900 --> 08:20.867
made it difficult
to see his children.

08:20.934 --> 08:24.500
So, that means you're using
the children as a control,

08:24.567 --> 08:26.066
which is really
not supposed to happen

08:26.133 --> 08:28.233
if you're a loving parent.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.367
[theme music]

08:37.867 --> 08:39.934
[narrator]
<i>Dawn Gilbert claims her son</i>

08:40.000 --> 08:42.900
<i>Nathan Gilbert</i>
<i>and his wife Hanna Gilbert</i>

08:42.967 --> 08:46.800
<i>owes her for unpaid loans</i>
<i>and car insurance.</i>

08:46.867 --> 08:49.500
Now, the attorney
appeared with you in court?

08:49.567 --> 08:50.934
We never went to court.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.066
I had ended up canceling
the whole divorce thing

08:53.133 --> 08:54.066
due to the fact that

08:54.133 --> 08:55.967
me and my wife
had come to terms.

08:56.033 --> 08:57.266
Everything was okay.

08:57.333 --> 08:58.200
[Judy] And that was in

08:58.266 --> 08:59.834
-March or April?
-It was in March, yes.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.200
Mrs. Gilbert,
did the attorney return

09:02.266 --> 09:04.867
any part of the retainer to you?

09:04.934 --> 09:05.900
Yes, she did.

09:05.967 --> 09:07.734
How much did she return?

09:07.800 --> 09:10.834
It was $372.50.

09:12.100 --> 09:15.266
Six sixty-one. 661. Yeah.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.133
Minus this portion, yeah.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.133
[Judy] Okay.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.066
Did your mother
discuss the return

09:20.133 --> 09:22.667
of the 661 dollars to her?

09:22.734 --> 09:23.934
-[Nathan] No.
-Did you ever give her

09:24.000 --> 09:26.300
any money towards
the 1,100 dollars?

09:26.367 --> 09:27.633
I was waiting
to give her money

09:27.700 --> 09:30.400
after the attorney
had contacted me

09:30.467 --> 09:31.700
as far as what was
returned to her,

09:31.767 --> 09:34.467
in which case I had made
weekly payments thereafter.

09:34.533 --> 09:35.633
You made weekly payments?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.033
-[Nathan] Yes.
-To your mother?

09:37.100 --> 09:39.100
-Yes. One was 200.
-[Judy] Okay.

09:39.166 --> 09:41.233
And then there were
100-dollar increments

09:41.300 --> 09:42.200
over the next three weeks.

09:42.266 --> 09:44.734
So, you returned
200 dollars to her?

09:44.800 --> 09:45.834
[Nathan] The first week, yes.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.066
[Judy] And then?

09:47.133 --> 09:49.033
A hundred dollars a week, weekly.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.033
[Judy] For how many weeks?

09:50.100 --> 09:51.033
[Nathan] Three weeks.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.767
So you still owe her 161 dollars?

09:53.834 --> 09:54.900
Is that where we're at?

09:54.967 --> 09:56.300
-Yes.
-[Judy] Okay.

09:56.367 --> 09:59.667
Mrs. Gilbert,
did your son return to you

09:59.734 --> 10:02.734
two hundred dollars the first week,
acknowledging the loan?

10:02.800 --> 10:03.800
No, ma'am.

10:03.867 --> 10:05.266
-[Judy] He did not?
-No, ma'am.

10:05.333 --> 10:09.266
I never received
a 200-dollar payment.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.667
[Judy] How much did you receive
in payments from him?

10:11.734 --> 10:15.066
Um, I received a total
of 300 dollars.

10:15.133 --> 10:18.767
One on the May 15th,
May 29th,

10:18.834 --> 10:21.934
and May 8th of a hundred dollars each.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.600
Do you have,
Mr. Gilbert, any proof

10:24.667 --> 10:27.166
that you gave your mother
a 200-dollar payment

10:27.233 --> 10:29.000
towards the attorney's fees?

10:29.066 --> 10:31.033
No, I don't have
the proof for the 200.

10:31.100 --> 10:35.400
I do have the proof for the,
uh, 200 thereafter.

10:35.467 --> 10:37.767
[Judy] For 300?
She said you made 300.

10:37.834 --> 10:38.834
-Yes, I...
-[Judy] Okay.

10:38.900 --> 10:39.834
...cleaned out the truck and--

10:39.900 --> 10:43.934
Okey-dokey.
So, we have 361.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.900
Now let's talk about the car.

10:45.967 --> 10:48.934
When you and your wife
separated, did you need a car?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.233
Uh, I received
this car in 2018.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.700
Okay. Explain to me
the circumstances

10:54.767 --> 10:55.700
surrounding the car.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.400
[Nathan] As far as
the circumstances, uh,

10:57.467 --> 10:59.734
there was an issue with
my sister's vehicle that her,

10:59.800 --> 11:01.300
my sister's vehicle
no longer ran.

11:01.367 --> 11:04.200
My mother approached me
as to if I wanted the vehicle,

11:04.266 --> 11:06.367
or if I was just
going to keep the vehicle

11:06.433 --> 11:08.467
that I had already bought
from her boyfriend.

11:08.533 --> 11:09.734
-[Judy] Okay.
-And my sister

11:09.800 --> 11:10.867
was going to get
the new vehicle.

11:10.934 --> 11:14.100
Okay, so this was a sort of
an inter-family swap.

11:14.166 --> 11:18.000
And what arrangement did
you make with regard to the car?

11:18.066 --> 11:19.200
Did you get a new car?

11:19.266 --> 11:20.200
Yes, I told my mother

11:20.266 --> 11:21.767
that I'd just paid off a tool bill,

11:21.834 --> 11:24.000
that I was able to give her
50 bucks a week.

11:24.066 --> 11:26.066
And I felt that that would be
the best option

11:26.133 --> 11:27.934
as opposed to my sister
not working at all,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.266
not being able to guarantee my mother
any money whatsoever?

11:30.333 --> 11:31.834
[Judy]
Okay, so you wanted a new car?

11:31.900 --> 11:33.200
-[Nathan] Yes.
-You wanted a new car.

11:33.266 --> 11:34.266
What kind of car did you get?

11:34.333 --> 11:36.166
It was a 2011 Ford Edge.

11:36.233 --> 11:37.834
[Judy] Do you remember
what you paid for it?

11:37.900 --> 11:40.166
Um, the total price
was 4,200 dollars.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.700
[Judy] Okay.
Do you have the bill of sale?

11:41.767 --> 11:42.700
No, I do not.

11:42.767 --> 11:43.700
-Do you?
-[Dawn] Yes, ma'am.

11:43.767 --> 11:45.266
[Judy] I'd like to see it, please.

11:48.767 --> 11:49.767
Thank you.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.834
[sighs]

11:56.300 --> 11:59.633
Right now, you got a new car
for 4,509.

11:59.700 --> 12:02.867
And that's in 2018.

12:02.934 --> 12:04.567
-[Nathan] Correct.
-Sarah, take a look and see

12:04.633 --> 12:08.500
if you can find
a 2011 Ford Edge.

12:08.567 --> 12:13.500
It ranges from
4,200 to about 5,300.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.567
-Today?
-[Sarah] Yes.

12:14.633 --> 12:15.500
In today's use.

12:15.567 --> 12:18.300
-So, that's probably right on.
-Yep.

12:18.367 --> 12:23.834
Okay. And how much of this 4,509
did you pay back?

12:23.900 --> 12:25.667
I paid back a total of 3,250.

12:25.734 --> 12:26.967
Is that correct?

12:27.033 --> 12:27.967
No, ma'am.

12:28.033 --> 12:30.400
You have receipts
for these payments?

12:30.467 --> 12:33.400
I have the last two receipts
of when they were paid off.

12:33.467 --> 12:34.500
That is all.

12:34.567 --> 12:36.533
At the time, me and my mother
were on good terms.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.734
I just handed her cash
on Saturdays

12:38.800 --> 12:40.767
that my wife would actually
take the children up

12:40.834 --> 12:43.066
-to see my mother on Saturdays.
-Every Saturday.

12:43.133 --> 12:44.066
That's what we did.

12:44.133 --> 12:45.066
I was working,
so I wanted to make sure

12:45.133 --> 12:46.934
my mother was still
seeing the grandchildren.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.300
You mean this is when
you and your wife were together?

12:49.367 --> 12:50.700
-Yes.
-[Judy] Okay.

12:50.767 --> 12:52.700
How much is it, Mrs. Gilbert,

12:52.767 --> 12:55.767
that you allege
that your son paid on the car?

12:55.834 --> 12:58.800
He paid 1,090 dollars total.

12:58.867 --> 13:02.233
And he says he paid
3,250 on the car.

13:02.300 --> 13:03.300
[Dawn] That is incorrect.

13:03.367 --> 13:08.633
I told him, um,
approximately three weeks ago

13:08.700 --> 13:11.300
that he still owed 3,420.

13:11.367 --> 13:14.700
And he did agree
to that via text.

13:14.767 --> 13:16.367
I'd like to see that.

13:29.667 --> 13:33.667
Are you counting in the money
that you paid, Mr. Gilbert,

13:33.734 --> 13:35.800
because you were paying
for not only the car,

13:35.867 --> 13:37.033
but the insurance?

13:37.100 --> 13:38.166
As far as the insurance,

13:38.233 --> 13:40.700
the insurance was something
that was never agreed upon.

13:40.767 --> 13:42.467
She told me that she was
going to have her name

13:42.533 --> 13:43.467
on the registration;

13:43.533 --> 13:45.433
that way she was able to
insure the vehicle.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.533
[Judy] Just a second.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.700
Mr. Gilbert, so I asked you
a simple question.

13:49.767 --> 13:52.166
What you didn't give me
was a simple answer.

13:52.233 --> 13:53.800
There's the 3,250

13:53.867 --> 13:56.633
that you claim that you paid
your mother.

13:56.700 --> 14:00.433
Did you pay a separate
insurance policy on the car

14:00.500 --> 14:02.333
that you and your wife
were driving?

14:02.400 --> 14:04.767
-No.
-[Judy] So I am correct

14:04.834 --> 14:06.934
that this 3,250

14:07.000 --> 14:10.867
encompasses both insurance
and the car payment?

14:10.934 --> 14:12.233
No, it was just
the car payment.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.967
Well, who paid
for the insurance?

14:14.033 --> 14:14.900
-[Nathan] My mother.
-I did, ma'am.

14:14.967 --> 14:17.100
Ah, that's ridiculous,
Mr. Gilbert.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.600
That's what I tried
to explain to her.

14:18.667 --> 14:19.667
[Judy] What do you mean,
you tried to

14:19.734 --> 14:21.066
-explain that to her?
-I tried to explain to my mother

14:21.133 --> 14:23.100
that I did not need her
to carry the insurance,

14:23.166 --> 14:24.166
that I had other vehicles

14:24.233 --> 14:25.300
and it would have been
cheaper for me

14:25.367 --> 14:27.633
to insure it with
my other vehicles.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.066
But she insisted on having
the insurance and--

14:30.133 --> 14:32.200
Just a second.
Is the car in your name?

14:32.266 --> 14:34.567
It's in both of our names,
my mother and I.

14:34.633 --> 14:36.200
[Judy] Well, maybe
it was to ensure

14:36.266 --> 14:37.433
that there was
current insurance.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.166
What other vehicles do you have?

14:39.233 --> 14:41.800
I currently have a 1998 BMW,

14:41.867 --> 14:44.567
and my wife has
a 2013 Toyota Corolla.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.100
You pay insurance
on those cars with what company?

14:47.166 --> 14:50.667
-Through, uh, Nationwide.
-[Judy] Amount?

14:50.734 --> 14:54.333
The total after dropping the
BMW because that no longer runs,

14:54.400 --> 14:56.467
-we pay 363.
-[Judy] Just a second.

14:56.533 --> 15:02.333
So, you currently only have
a 2013 car and this car.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.300
-Yes.
-That was purchased in 2018?

15:05.367 --> 15:07.367
-Correct.
-[Judy] And now,

15:07.433 --> 15:09.533
on the one car that you have,

15:09.600 --> 15:12.500
you paid 300 and--
how much?

15:12.567 --> 15:16.700
How much did he say he paid on
the one car that he has insured?

15:18.900 --> 15:21.166
It's 300 and something.

15:21.233 --> 15:22.533
[Nathan] It was for
the Toyota and a BMW.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.300
Just a--no, you said
you dropped the BMW.

15:25.367 --> 15:28.333
What you said was,
"We dropped the BMW

15:28.400 --> 15:29.700
because it's no longer running."

15:29.767 --> 15:31.166
-Is that what he said?
-That's what he said.

15:31.233 --> 15:32.166
-He said he paid--
-And he said--

15:32.233 --> 15:33.333
So the insurance is now--?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.367
Three sixty-three.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.200
Yes, because there is
a loan on the vehicle,

15:36.266 --> 15:37.400
and it has to have
full coverage.

15:37.467 --> 15:38.700
It's my vehicle, ma'am.

15:38.767 --> 15:42.066
I-I, uh, I carry high because
I'm considered a liable driver,

15:42.133 --> 15:44.133
being young, with a loan.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.400
So my insurance
is very expensive.

15:46.467 --> 15:50.233
So, why would it
have been cheaper?

15:50.300 --> 15:51.533
-[Nathan] With the--
-Mr. Gilbert?

15:51.600 --> 15:53.433
With the multi-car discount.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.600
Oh, you're ridiculous.

15:54.667 --> 15:55.867
[theme music]

15:55.934 --> 15:58.633
At the time that you said
those very ugly things

15:58.700 --> 15:59.633
about your wife,

15:59.700 --> 16:01.266
you wanted your mother
to believe you.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.266
Yes.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.266
All she knows is
you've told her

16:03.333 --> 16:05.567
some very angry and ugly things
about your wife,

16:05.633 --> 16:08.433
with whom you are now together.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.100
You can't do anything
about that, Mrs. Gilbert.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
[theme music]

16:21.467 --> 16:23.934
[narrator] <i>Dawn Gilbert</i>
<i>is accusing her son</i>

16:24.000 --> 16:26.767

pretty steep breakdown

16:35.600 --> 16:39.867
of a relationship between
a mother and a son very quickly

16:39.934 --> 16:42.100
over a four-week period.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.734
Mr. Gilbert, how do you think
that happened?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.400
-Due to the fact of me--
-[Dawn sobs]

16:46.467 --> 16:47.633
getting back with my wife.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.467
[clears throat] My mother
does not care for my wife.

16:50.533 --> 16:53.834
Um, after I told her
that I was moving back home,

16:53.900 --> 16:54.867
she told me that her house

16:54.934 --> 16:56.166
was no longer
a storage facility,

16:56.233 --> 16:57.667
that I needed to come
pick up my stuff,

16:57.734 --> 16:59.300
otherwise it would be
sitting outside.

16:59.367 --> 17:01.934
So, that should be
a good lesson for your mother

17:02.000 --> 17:04.367
and for everybody else
out there that, you know,

17:04.433 --> 17:06.500
until things
sort of calm down

17:06.567 --> 17:09.233
with somebody else's relationship,
a marriage,

17:09.300 --> 17:12.133
it's a very good idea
to keep your nose out of it.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.500
You know, the problem
with you and your mother is,

17:14.567 --> 17:16.633
you had a close relationship
with your mother.

17:16.700 --> 17:17.633
Yes.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.166
And I'm certain
that at the time

17:20.233 --> 17:22.100
that you and your wife separated,

17:22.166 --> 17:23.900
you unburdened yourself

17:23.967 --> 17:24.934
-to your mother.
-[Nathan] Yes.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.367
And when you unburdened
yourself to your mother,

17:27.433 --> 17:29.700
without getting into
the specifics of it,

17:29.767 --> 17:32.367
you said some very ugly things
about your wife.

17:32.433 --> 17:34.266
-Uh-huh. Yes.
-"Uh-huh" is not an answer.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.266
Yes.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.934
[Judy] And at the time
that you said

17:37.000 --> 17:39.100
those very ugly things
about your wife,

17:39.166 --> 17:40.900
you wanted your mother
to believe you?

17:40.967 --> 17:41.867
Yes.

17:41.934 --> 17:43.867
Because at the time you said
those very ugly things

17:43.934 --> 17:45.800
about your wife,
you believed them?

17:45.867 --> 17:48.500
-Yes.
-[Judy] See what happens? See?

17:48.567 --> 17:53.433
Your mother doesn't have all
the same elements that you do.

17:53.500 --> 17:57.133
She loves you.
She clearly loves her grandson.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.133
All she knows is you told her
some very angry and ugly things

18:00.200 --> 18:04.000
about your wife,
with whom you are now together.

18:04.066 --> 18:05.200
-Yes.
-You can't do anything

18:05.266 --> 18:07.133
about that, Mrs. Gilbert.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.600
-That's it.
-Right.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.400
-That's it.
-I understand that.

18:10.467 --> 18:13.166
You got it.
Can't do anything about that.

18:13.233 --> 18:14.266
It's his choice.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.266
But if you're a smart lady--

18:19.467 --> 18:21.834
[Dawn] Thank you. [sniffles]

18:21.900 --> 18:23.166
If you're a smart lady,

18:23.233 --> 18:26.367
-[Dawn] Thank you.
-and if your son is smart,

18:26.433 --> 18:28.800
he'll recognize
he has one mother.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.367
But the divorce rate
in this country

18:30.433 --> 18:31.934
is better than 50-50.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.500
So, chances are that you got
a 50 percent shot.

18:35.567 --> 18:36.567
Right.

18:36.633 --> 18:38.133
-You only have one mother.
-Mm-hm.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.467
And she's a mother who's
actually pretty good to you.

18:40.533 --> 18:41.667
For the most part, yes.

18:41.734 --> 18:45.533
Who clearly adores her grandson,

18:45.600 --> 18:47.400
who I don't know
if she sees anymore.

18:47.467 --> 18:48.367
No, ma'am.

18:48.433 --> 18:53.900
All I'm telling you both is that
that's being unfair to him.

18:53.967 --> 18:54.900
I understand.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.333
[Judy] You know,
controlling children,

18:57.400 --> 18:59.200
which is clearly something
that happened

18:59.266 --> 19:01.734
at least for a short time
with your husband,

19:01.800 --> 19:04.266
you controlled the children
because it was clear

19:04.333 --> 19:06.867
that if he couldn't see
the children with you,

19:06.934 --> 19:10.667
and your mother made it difficult
to see his children,

19:10.734 --> 19:14.700
so that means you're using
the children as a control,

19:14.767 --> 19:16.233
which is really not
supposed to happen

19:16.300 --> 19:17.467
if you're a loving parent.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.200
I control their influences.

19:19.266 --> 19:21.700
[Judy] No, what is supposed
to happen is,

19:21.767 --> 19:23.500
if you're a loving parent,

19:23.567 --> 19:29.533
you want the widest possible
community of a village

19:29.600 --> 19:31.867
who love them
to be part of them

19:31.934 --> 19:35.300
so that they can feel as if
they have a safety net,

19:35.367 --> 19:38.500
that they grow up with
as many safety nets of love

19:38.567 --> 19:39.934
in their life as possible.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.667
So, if you and your husband
are off for an evening,

19:42.734 --> 19:46.000
you're going to a casino
and your car gets blindsided

19:46.066 --> 19:50.100
and T-boned,
and both of you are gone,

19:50.166 --> 19:52.333
that there's a safety net
for them.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.133
You don't want to
take that away. It's unfair.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.166
In any event,
I don't want to hear about

19:57.233 --> 19:59.834
this protective order actually,
Mrs. Gilbert.

19:59.900 --> 20:00.800
You survived it.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.867
Did you hire a lawyer
for the protective order?

20:02.934 --> 20:03.867
No, ma'am.

20:03.934 --> 20:05.533
-I just wrote down and--
-Oh. All right.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.367
So, he owes you 3,250,

20:07.433 --> 20:11.567
which he actually sort of acknowledges
for the car,

20:11.633 --> 20:16.900
and 361 for the lawyer,
which is 3,611.

20:16.967 --> 20:19.967
Mr. Gilbert, Mrs. Gilbert,
marriages go through rocks.

20:20.033 --> 20:21.333
up and down and up and down.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.934
You have a child,
your child loves you.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Clearly, your child
had a relationship

20:26.066 --> 20:27.066
with his grandmother.

20:27.133 --> 20:28.066
-Right?
-Yes.

20:28.133 --> 20:31.033
You really should find
a way of making sure

20:31.100 --> 20:33.166
that that relationship continues,

20:33.233 --> 20:36.967
and try to put a period,
just as you put a period

20:37.033 --> 20:39.533
with the anger that you felt
towards your wife.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.533
-Yes.
-[Judy] Right?

20:40.600 --> 20:42.166
-Right.
-You put a period.

20:42.233 --> 20:43.066
Yes.

20:43.133 --> 20:44.867
I would try to do the same
with my mother.

20:44.934 --> 20:47.367
Judgment for the plaintiff.
We're finished. Thank you.

20:47.433 --> 20:48.467
[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

20:48.533 --> 20:50.834
[theme music]

20:50.900 --> 20:51.900
Uh, it was fair

20:51.967 --> 20:53.367
as far as the amount
that was owed.

20:53.433 --> 20:55.767
I did not want to pay her
what she was asking for.

20:55.834 --> 20:57.000
I'm glad that it's over with,

20:57.066 --> 20:58.967
and I hope everything
gets taken care of.

20:59.033 --> 21:00.400
I find it to be petty.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.400
I tried to get this settled out of court.

21:02.467 --> 21:05.700
She refused to work
any kind of deal out.

21:05.767 --> 21:06.700
And here we are.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.033
Being told I was being petty

21:08.100 --> 21:09.900
for wanting to be paid back.

21:09.967 --> 21:12.867
I have no idea.
The fact that me reconci--

21:12.934 --> 21:15.000
getting back with my wife.
I have no idea.

21:15.066 --> 21:15.967
That is true.

21:16.033 --> 21:18.100
But it's not my marriage,
it's theirs.

21:18.166 --> 21:19.900
Um, they started off
with a great relationship

21:19.967 --> 21:22.400
when me and my wife first got
together, when we were dating,

21:22.467 --> 21:24.700
and it seems to tinker downhill.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.633
I hope our relationship
can be put back together,

21:26.700 --> 21:27.667
I really do.

21:27.734 --> 21:29.533
Uh, if she can be
cordial about it,

21:29.600 --> 21:30.600
and not throw rocks,

21:30.667 --> 21:32.300
show up at my work
threatening me...

21:32.367 --> 21:35.367
I just went and asked him
if we could talk like adults.

21:35.433 --> 21:36.667
...then there's a possibility, yes.

21:36.734 --> 21:38.400
I'm glad it's over.

21:38.467 --> 21:39.867
As someone
who was fortunate enough

21:39.934 --> 21:42.500
to grow up with
many safety nets,

21:42.567 --> 21:44.133
I think that was
a great lesson in there

21:44.200 --> 21:48.867
to both the defendants that
taking away a child's safety net

21:48.934 --> 21:53.066
because of some sort of
ill will or harbored resentment

21:53.133 --> 21:55.166
against a parent
is just unfortunate,

21:55.233 --> 21:56.333
legal issue or not.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.000
So, I thought
that was a great lesson.

21:58.066 --> 22:01.867
I always feel sorry
for grandparents

22:01.934 --> 22:03.867
who love their children,

22:03.934 --> 22:08.600
and then get themselves
involved with a breakup,

22:08.667 --> 22:12.633
which happens frequently,
take sides right away

22:12.700 --> 22:16.333
before the situation has
sort of calmed itself down

22:16.400 --> 22:19.000
and you see in what direction it's going.

22:19.066 --> 22:20.767
Maybe he'll listen.
You know, I didn't know,

22:20.834 --> 22:23.667
but I'm sure he said a lot of
nasty things about his wife

22:23.734 --> 22:25.266
when he went to live
with his mother.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.467
She saw how hurt he was.

22:27.533 --> 22:30.967
She developed her own
resentments that spilled over.

22:31.033 --> 22:35.200
But, you know,
you gotta love your children.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.500
More than
you hate each other.

22:36.567 --> 22:38.233
-[Judy] Right.
-[chuckles]

22:38.300 --> 22:39.266
Very good.
