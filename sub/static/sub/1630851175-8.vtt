00:10.822 --> 00:12.458
Previously on
The Last Man...

00:12.491 --> 00:13.761
I have White House
credentials.

00:13.794 --> 00:15.397
I worked for the president.
Nora Brady.

00:15.430 --> 00:17.334
‐You're not on the list.
‐Do you smell that?

00:17.368 --> 00:18.470
There's nobody here.

00:18.504 --> 00:20.207
It looks like your leg is hurt.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.079
That is infected.
Where are you two staying?

00:23.113 --> 00:25.150
I mean, we could be
really good here.

00:25.183 --> 00:26.520
We could start over.

00:27.689 --> 00:29.660
Shit.

00:29.693 --> 00:31.296
‐No, no, no, no, no, no!
‐She's a doctor!

00:31.329 --> 00:33.534
She's hurt, right?
Your friend. She can help.

00:33.568 --> 00:35.070
No!

00:35.103 --> 00:37.408
Her, we can help.
What's she need?

00:37.441 --> 00:38.811
She needs antibiotics.

00:38.844 --> 00:40.480
We have beds, food.

00:40.515 --> 00:42.117
What happened to Kate?
You're all pretending

00:42.151 --> 00:43.053
like nothing happened.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.790
We're not allowed
to be alone with you.

00:44.823 --> 00:47.529
What's the first thing
men usually say to you?

00:47.562 --> 00:49.232
Okay, Roxanne,
that's enough.

00:49.265 --> 00:50.568
She lost her father,

00:50.602 --> 00:52.839
her eight‐year‐old brother.
She's grieving!

00:52.872 --> 00:54.643
Welcome, Athena.

00:56.614 --> 00:58.183
This place isn't
all bad, right?

00:58.216 --> 00:59.519
I don't think
they want me here.

00:59.553 --> 01:01.289
I'd like you to stay
and join us.

01:01.322 --> 01:03.159
You can be
whoever you want here.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.136
Kate, you're past
the perimeter.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.773
Shouldn't be out here.

01:09.806 --> 01:13.346
I can't keep you safe
if you don't follow the rules.

01:14.549 --> 01:17.321
‐I'm fine.
‐Let's get you dry.

01:17.354 --> 01:18.691
You must be freezing.

01:18.724 --> 01:20.528
‐I'm fine!
‐No.

01:20.561 --> 01:22.264
Kate, just listen to me.

01:22.298 --> 01:23.668
‐Just stay away from me.
‐No, no.

01:23.701 --> 01:25.470
Just stop, okay?

01:25.505 --> 01:28.276
‐I'm just gonna go, okay?
‐No.

01:28.310 --> 01:30.180
‐I won't tell anyone.
‐No, no, no.

01:30.213 --> 01:31.482
Just listen to me.

01:31.517 --> 01:33.153
‐Kate!

01:35.925 --> 01:38.163
What is wrong with you?

01:38.196 --> 01:39.633
Goddamn it!

01:39.666 --> 01:41.436
Kate.

01:43.874 --> 01:45.410
Fuck!

01:45.444 --> 01:47.314
‐Inside! Now!
‐Were those gunshots?

01:47.348 --> 01:48.483
‐Everybody inside!
‐What's going on?

01:48.517 --> 01:50.187
‐Attack positions!
‐Who's out there?

01:50.220 --> 01:51.557
Where's Kate?

03:05.404 --> 03:06.774
Holy shit.

03:14.288 --> 03:15.591
All right, hold up.

03:15.625 --> 03:16.927
Taylor.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.766
You got to plant
your lower body. Yep.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.708
You got to really dig
in down here. Yeah?

03:23.741 --> 03:24.910
Watch Jodi.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.880
She's like a redwood
when she's firing.

03:29.986 --> 03:32.759
Well... damn.

03:34.563 --> 03:36.734
‐Don't think he's gonna mess
with you again.

03:36.767 --> 03:39.438
She's a natural, folks.

03:41.008 --> 03:42.612
Nice job, Hero.

03:42.645 --> 03:45.685
Men have told you
what your body is for‐‐

03:45.718 --> 03:48.022
to be looked at,

03:48.056 --> 03:51.028
fucked, impregnated
and then discarded.

03:51.062 --> 03:53.601
They don't respect it.
Why should you?

03:53.634 --> 03:55.838
But what if your arms
were for holding,

03:55.872 --> 03:57.842
and your legs were for running

03:57.876 --> 04:00.982
and your body belonged to you?

04:01.015 --> 04:03.954
We're stronger
than they told us we were.

04:03.988 --> 04:04.990
Right, Hero?

04:06.994 --> 04:08.697
Yeah. Yes.

04:08.731 --> 04:09.699
That's right.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.870
All right, next group
on the line. Let's go.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.623
Hey.

04:21.657 --> 04:23.326
You got to try this.

04:23.359 --> 04:24.896
Uh, I'm good. Uh...

04:24.930 --> 04:26.332
You're gonna like it.

04:26.365 --> 04:27.468
It's just not my thing.

04:27.502 --> 04:28.604
‐Let's not...
‐Just give it...

04:28.637 --> 04:30.775
What's going on?

04:30.808 --> 04:32.512
Um...

04:32.545 --> 04:34.850
I‐I'm...
I'm just not a gun guy.

04:34.883 --> 04:35.985
Oh.

04:36.018 --> 04:38.724
Uh, but, uh,
that's just me,

04:38.757 --> 04:40.928
so go for it.

04:40.962 --> 04:43.934
What'd you do, Sam,
before all this?

04:43.968 --> 04:47.742
Uh, I was an artist.
I worked in theater.

04:47.775 --> 04:48.777
You worked in theater?

04:48.811 --> 04:51.650
Gah. That sounds fun.

04:51.683 --> 04:53.319
Was that fun?

04:54.689 --> 04:55.992
Sometimes.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.337
What the rest of us
are doing now

05:02.371 --> 05:03.741
is trying to stay alive.

05:03.774 --> 05:05.010
Learning to protect ourselves,

05:05.043 --> 05:07.047
rather than asking
somebody else to do it for us.

05:09.051 --> 05:11.455
That's a field you might need
a little practice in.

05:14.796 --> 05:17.569
All right, on the line!
Let's go, Sam!

05:17.602 --> 05:20.675
Ready, aim, fire!

05:23.079 --> 05:25.785
‐Hi, Mom.

05:25.818 --> 05:27.889
We're in the lead.
We're in the lead.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.665
‐Watch, Mom!
‐I'm trying, honey.

05:32.699 --> 05:35.370
She's such a great kid.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.374
We all really like her.

05:38.711 --> 05:41.449
‐Oh, yeah. Thanks.
‐Hi, Mom.

05:41.482 --> 05:43.787
I haven't seen her
this happy in a long time.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.658
Where will you go?

05:47.494 --> 05:49.666
What?

05:49.699 --> 05:50.835
Well, when you leave,
I mean.

05:50.868 --> 05:54.475
I mean,
we were planning to stay.

05:54.509 --> 05:56.947
Oh, I‐I...
I just thought that

05:56.980 --> 05:59.451
‐Roxanne had talked to you.
‐About what?

05:59.485 --> 06:00.955
Nicole?

06:05.030 --> 06:07.134
I shouldn't have said anything.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.071
Fuck. I'm‐I'm sorry.

06:09.104 --> 06:12.077
What‐what... what happened?
Was there a‐a vote or something?

06:12.110 --> 06:13.881
We don't vote.

06:22.732 --> 06:24.736
I'm trying, honey.

06:29.779 --> 06:31.850
Why are you doing this?

06:31.883 --> 06:34.121
She's 12 years old.

06:34.154 --> 06:36.058
Mack's healthy.
She's feeling better.

06:36.092 --> 06:37.461
This was always temporary.

06:37.494 --> 06:38.731
I'll do whatever you want.

06:38.764 --> 06:41.135
Just tell me what it is,
and I'll do it.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.507
This group isn't for everybody.

06:43.540 --> 06:44.709
Give you a few more days,

06:44.743 --> 06:46.445
‐and then that's it. It's time.

06:46.479 --> 06:48.449
‐It's not personal.
‐It feels fucking personal.

06:49.485 --> 06:51.188
You'll find a group
where you fit in.

06:51.222 --> 06:52.759
This is, what?
Your intuition?

06:52.792 --> 06:54.028
You had a dream or something?

06:54.061 --> 06:56.065
You don't like me because,
what, because I‐I...

06:56.098 --> 06:58.504
I liked my husband?
Because I'm not 22?

06:58.537 --> 07:00.741
You're angry.

07:00.775 --> 07:02.812
I don't blame you.

07:02.845 --> 07:05.584
I know what it's like to wake up
in a life you didn't ask for.

07:06.954 --> 07:08.891
But I can't help you, Nora.

07:08.924 --> 07:10.795
You're not our people.

07:10.828 --> 07:13.232
We'll die out there.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.472
Give yourself some credit.

07:16.506 --> 07:18.443
You made it this far.

07:27.227 --> 07:28.797
Police!

07:33.741 --> 07:36.847
Make yourself known, right now,

07:36.880 --> 07:39.619
if you do not want to get shot.

07:55.985 --> 07:57.487
Police.

07:58.557 --> 07:59.793
Anybody get eyes
on the shooter?

07:59.826 --> 08:00.928
We didn't see anyone.

08:00.961 --> 08:03.032
We just heard gunshots.

08:05.571 --> 08:06.940
‐Who's out there?
‐I don't know.

08:06.973 --> 08:09.111
Didn't get a good look at them.

08:09.144 --> 08:10.681
Them?

08:10.715 --> 08:12.785
‐More than one?
‐Two, at least.

08:14.589 --> 08:17.027
You can't stay here.
It's not safe.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.198
We don't have
anywhere else to go.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.803
How'd you land this place?

08:21.837 --> 08:23.072
Well, I used to shop here.

08:23.106 --> 08:24.976
And then, after it happened,

08:25.010 --> 08:28.016
I thought I would try
to get some supplies

08:28.049 --> 08:30.220
and get 'em to the people
that needed it the most,

08:30.253 --> 08:32.558
but this place was chaos.

08:32.592 --> 08:36.900
Looting. People fighting,
shooting at each other.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.271
Felt I had an obligation
to keep the peace.

08:41.308 --> 08:42.979
Eventually,
they got the message.

08:43.012 --> 08:44.849
Stopped coming. So...

08:44.883 --> 08:48.322
I stayed. There's a couple
generators in the back.

08:48.356 --> 08:50.795
Rigged up some space heaters.

08:50.828 --> 08:52.765
You're a cop?

08:52.799 --> 08:55.303
Detective.
Homicide. 11 years.

08:55.336 --> 08:57.608
You got any idea

08:57.642 --> 09:00.648
who might have wanted to take
a few shots at your place?

09:00.681 --> 09:04.054
My experience, this type of
violence isn't usually random.

09:04.088 --> 09:05.658
Not really. No.

09:05.691 --> 09:08.029
So this house
that you're living in,

09:08.062 --> 09:11.135
that's, like,
a group home situation?

09:11.168 --> 09:12.605
Domestic violence?

09:12.638 --> 09:14.141
Yes, ma'am.

09:14.174 --> 09:16.011
Hey.

09:16.045 --> 09:17.615
You don't have
to call me ma'am.

09:18.984 --> 09:19.953
Habit.

09:19.986 --> 09:22.357
You don't trust cops, do you?

09:22.390 --> 09:24.361
Nope.

09:24.394 --> 09:25.296
Hey, I don't blame you.

09:25.330 --> 09:28.737
Police don't always
believe you, right?

09:28.771 --> 09:31.041
They don't want to get
involved in the romantic drama.

09:32.912 --> 09:35.751
But in Homicide,
we see what happens

09:35.785 --> 09:37.789
when a woman isn't listened to.

09:42.097 --> 09:46.071
We've heard rumors
that some men survived.

09:46.105 --> 09:48.644
‐Is that true?
‐Hey, it could be.

09:48.677 --> 09:50.781
You think one of
your boyfriends found you,

09:50.815 --> 09:52.017
tried to take a shot
at the house?

09:52.050 --> 09:54.188
If there are men left, Nicky's
boyfriend's not one of them.

09:54.221 --> 09:56.392
That fucker's dead for sure.

09:56.425 --> 09:57.862
He's too dumb to survive.

10:00.734 --> 10:04.909
So, who's the, uh,
counselor, group leader?

10:04.943 --> 10:07.047
Uh, Virginia.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.382
She left.

10:08.416 --> 10:09.953
Middle of the night,
right after it happened.

10:09.986 --> 10:12.257
That's a kick
in the soft stuff.

10:12.290 --> 10:14.328
I always hated that bitch.

10:14.361 --> 10:17.100
There it is.
What's your name?

10:17.134 --> 10:19.338
Kate.

10:19.371 --> 10:20.708
I like you, Kate.

10:21.743 --> 10:24.716
Your house, it's remote.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.887
One long road in.
Woods all around.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.356
Lot of windows.

10:28.389 --> 10:32.130
If it was safe before,
it's not safe now.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.336
You could stay here.

10:35.370 --> 10:38.075
It's clean, warm,
safe as it gets.

10:38.109 --> 10:40.246
Well, we promised each other
we'd stay together

10:40.280 --> 10:43.352
‐as long as we could.
‐Yeah.

10:43.386 --> 10:46.292
That's beautiful. Really.

10:46.325 --> 10:49.933
But I'm inviting all of you,
of course.

10:51.202 --> 10:53.239
You're all welcome here.

10:59.017 --> 11:00.988
There was only one other girl
on the force.

11:01.021 --> 11:02.257
Patrol officer. Jenna.

11:02.290 --> 11:04.428
One day, I'm in the break room.

11:04.461 --> 11:07.367
I overhear a couple of guys
talking about her. You know...

11:07.400 --> 11:09.371
her ass, her rack‐‐

11:09.404 --> 11:11.208
nasty guy shit. So...

11:11.242 --> 11:14.682
I find her and I tell her,
"Hey, just heads up,

11:14.716 --> 11:16.953
watch out for these fuckers."

11:16.987 --> 11:18.857
She tells me keep away from her.

11:18.891 --> 11:20.393
Says I'm jealous
of the attention.

11:20.426 --> 11:23.399
SAM Hmm,
maybe she just didn't like you.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.003
What was that?

11:25.036 --> 11:26.873
Sam?

11:26.907 --> 11:28.242
Nothing.

11:29.278 --> 11:32.050
‐Hero, you're up.
‐No.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.419
I'm asking you.

11:47.782 --> 11:50.086
Tell us about your dad.

11:51.088 --> 11:53.760
He was an English professor.

11:53.794 --> 11:56.031
He was really smart.

11:56.065 --> 11:58.302
‐Um...
‐How'd he treat your mom?

11:58.336 --> 12:00.139
He loved her. He respected her.

12:00.173 --> 12:02.177
But?

12:02.210 --> 12:04.782
I‐I don't know
what you want me to say.

12:04.816 --> 12:06.953
You got siblings?

12:06.987 --> 12:08.422
Or you want to talk about Sam?

12:14.903 --> 12:17.007
‐I had a brother.
‐Brother. Okay.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.946
Okay. Tell me about him.

12:19.979 --> 12:22.450
‐He was one of the good ones.
‐Interrogate that.

12:22.484 --> 12:25.925
I had plenty of...

12:25.958 --> 12:28.462
shitty guys
that we can talk about.

12:28.496 --> 12:30.333
You had the same parents.

12:30.366 --> 12:31.503
Same schools.

12:31.536 --> 12:32.805
Same house.

12:32.838 --> 12:34.174
How was your life different?

12:34.207 --> 12:35.844
Well, we were just different.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.449
He was the funny one.

12:38.482 --> 12:40.186
‐I think you're funny.
‐I think you're funny.

12:40.219 --> 12:42.090
‐I think you're funny.
‐Well, my parents were

12:42.123 --> 12:44.194
a lot harder on me.

12:44.227 --> 12:46.065
But I was
a lot harder to deal with.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.233
'Cause you're a girl.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.204
No, 'cause I was a dick.

12:49.237 --> 12:50.941
I have a temper.

12:50.975 --> 12:52.344
I did shit they didn't like.

12:52.377 --> 12:54.348
‐Drugs?
‐Sure.

12:54.381 --> 12:56.051
‐Men?
‐Yeah.

12:56.085 --> 12:58.356
‐But your brother,
he was the good one?
‐Not exactly.

12:58.389 --> 13:00.326
I mean, he was
kind of a mess, too.

13:01.362 --> 13:03.199
Can we move on?

13:03.232 --> 13:05.136
‐Please?
‐Should we?

13:05.169 --> 13:07.007
No.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.812
I'm sorry, it's just, he was...

13:09.846 --> 13:11.382
the only...

13:13.152 --> 13:14.522
...person in my family

13:14.555 --> 13:17.962
that even remotely
understood me.

13:17.995 --> 13:19.999
Sure.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.368
He didn't judge you.

13:21.402 --> 13:23.472
He loved you.

13:23.507 --> 13:25.310
But I wonder...

13:27.447 --> 13:29.519
...what did he say about you

13:29.552 --> 13:32.257
‐when you weren't in the room?
‐I don't know.

13:32.290 --> 13:34.094
‐I wasn't in the room.
‐When your parents

13:34.127 --> 13:37.233
were angry at you,
he stuck up for you?

13:37.267 --> 13:38.970
He didn't like to fight, but...

13:39.004 --> 13:40.406
So he didn't.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.547
‐I didn't say that.
‐So behind closed doors,

13:43.580 --> 13:45.517
he had your back...

13:45.551 --> 13:48.557
but when push came to shove,
he was quiet.

13:48.590 --> 13:50.594
Why was that, I wonder.

13:50.627 --> 13:53.299
Maybe he was okay
with your struggle.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.569
What do you think, Sam?

13:57.407 --> 14:00.113
Maybe his life felt better
by comparison.

14:07.193 --> 14:09.031
I know the way.
I mean, I know the route.

14:09.064 --> 14:10.333
That's where I came from.

14:10.366 --> 14:12.270
They'll let us in
if Hero's with us.

14:12.303 --> 14:13.907
I‐I could help you get there...

14:13.940 --> 14:15.176
It's not up to me.

14:15.209 --> 14:17.280
She can't be that stubborn,
can she?

14:17.313 --> 14:19.184
Look, I know things were tense,

14:19.217 --> 14:21.321
‐but‐but come on, I mean...
‐I can't speak for Hero.

14:22.357 --> 14:24.327
You can talk to her.

14:24.361 --> 14:25.463
She listens to you.

14:25.496 --> 14:27.167
I know you don't like it here,
either.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.137
Did I give you the impression
that we're friends?

14:34.949 --> 14:37.187
Is this about who I worked for?

14:37.220 --> 14:39.191
The bill?

14:39.224 --> 14:41.328
You wanted to play sports with
your friends, and you couldn't.

14:41.361 --> 14:43.332
I get it, but it wasn't me.
I didn't write it.

14:43.365 --> 14:45.470
And honestly,
none of that matters now.

14:45.504 --> 14:47.942
‐That's certainly
a position to take.
‐Sam!

14:47.975 --> 14:49.444
You know, not everything is
about me being trans.

14:51.115 --> 14:52.317
I just don't trust you.

14:57.393 --> 15:00.399
And I never played
any fucking sports.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.571
If you'd listen to a word I
said, you would have known that.

15:02.605 --> 15:05.209
This place has everything,
for now.

15:05.243 --> 15:07.213
But there aren't
any more trucks coming.

15:07.247 --> 15:09.217
Sooner or later,
the food will run out.

15:09.251 --> 15:10.453
What happens then?

15:11.488 --> 15:13.292
Good luck.

15:31.529 --> 15:34.401
I... I, um, I found a map.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.975
Smith Mountain Lake is only
a few days' hike from here.

15:38.008 --> 15:39.979
It's all summer places.

15:40.012 --> 15:41.616
It'd be empty.
We'd have our pick.

15:43.653 --> 15:45.423
Come on.

15:45.456 --> 15:48.697
You and me in a tacky mansion
on the water? I mean...

15:48.730 --> 15:51.001
We could start our own thing.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.671
You know?

15:52.705 --> 15:55.644
People like us or... artists?

15:55.677 --> 15:57.413
Just not so many guns.

15:57.447 --> 16:00.486
It's not a bad idea
to learn how to shoot.

16:02.056 --> 16:04.294
Yeah, okay, that's...
that's not really the issue.

16:04.327 --> 16:06.398
‐Then what's the issue?

16:06.431 --> 16:08.435
This isn't us.

16:08.469 --> 16:10.541
I'm tired, Sam.

16:10.574 --> 16:12.678
I don't want to do this
right now.

16:12.711 --> 16:14.582
'Cause being in a cult
is fucking exhausting.

16:14.615 --> 16:16.653
‐God, give me a fucking break.
‐And you know what?
You may as well

16:16.686 --> 16:18.389
just join the NRA
while you're at it.

16:18.422 --> 16:20.561
You know what? It's good here.
They've got food.

16:20.594 --> 16:22.397
They've got clean water.

16:22.430 --> 16:24.067
Why are you trying
to fuck this up?

16:24.100 --> 16:26.606
You get that this is shitty
for me, right? I mean,

16:26.639 --> 16:29.444
‐you get that?
‐It's shitty
because you're fighting it.

16:29.477 --> 16:31.716
They keep talking
about how terrible men are.

16:31.749 --> 16:33.419
Okay, but everybody likes you.

16:33.452 --> 16:36.058
So which is it?

16:36.091 --> 16:39.064
Uh, they like me because
I'm‐I'm not really a man,

16:39.097 --> 16:41.769
or I am, and I'm
just another fucking...

16:41.803 --> 16:43.573
‐serial killer or rapist?
‐Sam.

16:43.607 --> 16:45.276
‐Sam.
‐No, honestly,
it's fucking confusing.

16:45.309 --> 16:48.415
One second,
Kelsey is all over me,

16:48.449 --> 16:51.455
and then the next,
she literally can't look at me.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.593
Kelsey's...

16:53.627 --> 16:55.296
all over you?

16:57.500 --> 16:58.737
Okay.

16:58.770 --> 17:01.776
Hero, a fucking cop...

17:01.809 --> 17:06.184
a cop playing therapist making
you hate your dead brother?

17:06.218 --> 17:08.523
‐It's a joke.
‐She's not wrong.

17:08.557 --> 17:10.059
That's bullshit.

17:10.092 --> 17:12.330
‐You're...
‐You know what? I have an idea.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.071
Why don't you just, like,
make the most of it here?

17:16.104 --> 17:18.175
Fuck Kelsey,
if it'll cheer you up!

17:18.209 --> 17:20.079
Oh, my God, Hero, what the fuck?

17:20.112 --> 17:21.448
I mean it.

17:21.481 --> 17:24.755
She is better for you anyway.

17:24.789 --> 17:28.128
‐She's sweet
and a little bit dumb.
‐Better for me?

17:28.162 --> 17:31.101
Than what?

17:31.134 --> 17:32.638
Than you?

17:32.671 --> 17:35.076
I am smart enough to know

17:35.109 --> 17:37.080
the second I have you to myself,

17:37.113 --> 17:39.518
that just starts the clock,
and then...

17:39.552 --> 17:41.789
it's only a matter of time
until I'm in the discard pile

17:41.823 --> 17:43.492
with all the rest of them.

17:43.526 --> 17:45.396
"All the rest of them"?

17:45.429 --> 17:48.102
Just say you don't want me
'cause you think I'm a whore.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.774
‐ don't think that. You do.
I am not the voice in your head.
‐Why didn't you just

17:50.807 --> 17:52.711
‐go with those guys to Vermont?
‐You know why!

17:53.713 --> 17:56.385
You are...

17:56.418 --> 17:57.821
my family, okay?

17:57.855 --> 18:00.092
You are all I have.

18:00.126 --> 18:02.096
So just come with me.

18:02.130 --> 18:04.535
Please, just come.

18:04.568 --> 18:07.140
We could go tonight.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.277
It could be good here.

18:09.311 --> 18:11.281
You've got me. I've got you.

18:11.315 --> 18:12.785
No. No, you don't.

18:14.154 --> 18:16.124
You never have.

18:16.158 --> 18:19.130
If you loved me the way...

18:19.164 --> 18:20.734
I love you,

18:20.767 --> 18:22.805
you would keep
a single fucking promise.

18:22.838 --> 18:26.378
But you can't.
And I am so stupid

18:26.411 --> 18:29.552
‐for ever thinking that you...
‐That's enough.

18:29.585 --> 18:31.689
Leave her alone.

18:32.725 --> 18:34.795
I am talking to my friend.

18:34.829 --> 18:36.465
Doesn't sound like you're
talking to a friend to me.

18:36.498 --> 18:38.302
Can you give us
a fucking minute? Please.

18:38.335 --> 18:41.609
‐Apologize to Hero.
‐Roxanne, I'm... I'm fine.

18:41.643 --> 18:43.680
He doesn't get to talk
to you like that.

18:43.713 --> 18:45.717
Sam, just say you're sorry.

18:45.751 --> 18:47.755
No.

18:47.788 --> 18:50.359
‐Sam...
‐No. I'm not sorry.

18:50.393 --> 18:52.731
I am not.
This place is fucked up.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.802
And you know it.

18:56.471 --> 18:58.409
We're just... tired.

19:00.246 --> 19:02.283
He's just tired.

19:02.317 --> 19:05.824
Please, Roxanne. I'm fine.

19:08.596 --> 19:10.466
Okay.

19:10.499 --> 19:13.305
All right, everybody,
show's over.

19:16.378 --> 19:18.182
Nice.

20:04.842 --> 20:06.646
Knew you were stealing.

20:06.679 --> 20:08.783
Just didn't know
where you were hiding it.

20:08.817 --> 20:10.787
It's‐it's just enough for me,

20:10.821 --> 20:12.390
for a couple days.

20:12.423 --> 20:14.895
Well, you better get going.
She'll be awake soon.

20:22.544 --> 20:23.813
She's a good person.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.451
‐She just...
‐I know she is.

20:26.485 --> 20:27.955
We'll take care of her.

20:27.988 --> 20:30.660
She's not your problem anymore.

20:51.435 --> 20:52.671
Shit.

21:00.019 --> 21:01.923
Okay, okay.

21:07.868 --> 21:09.404
Fuck.

21:12.878 --> 21:14.347
Oh, come on.

21:15.650 --> 21:16.986
Jesus.

21:45.376 --> 21:47.848
Hi.

21:50.486 --> 21:52.758
It's okay. I won't hurt you.

22:15.937 --> 22:17.841
She's home!

22:18.843 --> 22:21.481
You guys, look! Look, look!

22:21.516 --> 22:23.385
She's back!

22:48.703 --> 22:50.674
You don't need to do that.

22:52.076 --> 22:55.416
I just thought
that maybe we could, uh...

22:55.449 --> 22:58.823
use this space for...

22:58.856 --> 23:01.729
for something else.

23:02.731 --> 23:04.067
Did he tell you he was leaving?

23:05.102 --> 23:08.776
Kelsey saw he was hiding
a stash of supplies.

23:09.812 --> 23:11.649
He's been stealing for a while.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.953
I don't think he's coming back.

23:17.493 --> 23:18.696
Yeah.

23:27.146 --> 23:28.783
Hey.

23:30.486 --> 23:33.593
Come here. Come here.

23:33.626 --> 23:35.730
‐Aw.

23:35.764 --> 23:37.400
Yeah.

23:41.742 --> 23:43.980
Look at me. Look at me.

23:45.650 --> 23:47.754
He doesn't deserve you.

23:47.788 --> 23:51.729
‐I promised him
we were gonna stick together.
‐Yeah. Yeah, well,

23:51.762 --> 23:54.535
he broke that promise, not you.

23:58.710 --> 24:00.580
You know my husband left me?

24:00.614 --> 24:02.216
Eddie.

24:02.249 --> 24:05.489
He was a fucking asshole.

24:05.523 --> 24:07.628
God, but he made me laugh.

24:07.661 --> 24:10.132
We were together
since high school, right?

24:10.165 --> 24:12.771
I put up
with so much shit from him.

24:14.173 --> 24:16.612
I thought he'd stick with me
when times got tough,

24:16.646 --> 24:18.850
but I should've known better.

24:19.818 --> 24:21.555
Men aren't good at staying.

24:24.962 --> 24:27.768
Fuck him. Yeah?

24:31.676 --> 24:34.615
I got just the thing
to cheer you up.

24:53.586 --> 24:55.189
What is this?

24:55.222 --> 24:57.059
It's a Fuck 'Em party.

24:57.093 --> 24:59.631
What is it, Jodi?

24:59.665 --> 25:01.101
It's a We're Better Off
Without 'Em party.

25:01.134 --> 25:05.075
‐But I thought...
‐Our bodies are temples?

25:05.109 --> 25:07.013
They are.

25:07.046 --> 25:08.683
And who do they belong to?

25:08.716 --> 25:10.185
‐- Us!
‐- And if we want

25:10.219 --> 25:12.089
to throw a party
in our fucking temple,

25:12.123 --> 25:15.062
‐we throw a party! Kelsey.
‐Yeah!

25:16.866 --> 25:19.203
Some asshole's boner pills.

25:21.241 --> 25:23.880
We don't need that shit anymore.

25:28.956 --> 25:30.927
Chuck it in the fire.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.599
Go on.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.937
They're waiting for you.

25:48.996 --> 25:50.232
Yeah!

27:06.117 --> 27:08.054
Kiddo!

27:08.088 --> 27:10.225
‐Come here!
‐I'm dancing.

27:10.259 --> 27:11.962
Just for a minute, okay?

27:16.772 --> 27:18.208
Look so cute.

27:18.241 --> 27:20.880
I was thinking, um,

27:20.914 --> 27:24.888
maybe we could go back home.

27:24.922 --> 27:27.226
‐There's nothing there.
‐I mean,

27:27.259 --> 27:28.930
I mean, back to D. C.,
to the city.

27:28.963 --> 27:30.299
They have big camps there.

27:30.332 --> 27:32.704
What‐what happened?
Did you do something?

27:32.737 --> 27:35.810
What? No.

27:35.844 --> 27:38.950
‐Are they making us leave?
‐No, no, no, no, no.

27:38.983 --> 27:41.054
No. No, no, no. There's... No.

27:41.087 --> 27:42.991
There's‐there's too many
of us here.

27:43.024 --> 27:44.695
We're‐we're better off
on our own.

27:44.728 --> 27:46.999
I'm not stupid.
I know they don't like you.

27:47.032 --> 27:48.936
‐Hey.
‐I'm not leaving.

27:48.970 --> 27:50.205
‐Hey!
‐I'm not leaving!

27:50.239 --> 27:52.076
‐Mack.
‐I‐I like it here.

27:52.109 --> 27:53.813
‐I have friends here.
‐That's enough. Hey!

27:53.846 --> 27:56.084
‐Dad would've let me s...
‐Well,

27:56.117 --> 27:58.221
Daddy's not here!
You're stuck with me.

27:59.290 --> 28:00.860
Mackenzie.

28:00.894 --> 28:02.263
Mackenzie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30:37.406 --> 30:39.043
‐Wake up! Wake up!

30:39.076 --> 30:40.379
Wake up, Hero. Hero, wake up.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.953
The building is on fire.
We have to get outside

30:43.986 --> 30:45.590
right now. Come on. Come on.

30:45.623 --> 30:47.126
‐Mack!

30:47.159 --> 30:48.963
Mack, come on! Come on!

30:51.334 --> 30:52.971
Everybody out!

30:53.004 --> 30:56.010
‐Hey, let's go!
Come on.

31:05.395 --> 31:06.932
Is everyone okay?

31:30.680 --> 31:32.650
Fuck!

31:37.292 --> 31:39.063
Fucker!

31:39.096 --> 31:41.467
Goddamn it!

32:19.210 --> 32:20.513
Okay.

32:27.259 --> 32:28.929
Oh, shit.

32:36.678 --> 32:39.216
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

33:21.267 --> 33:22.637
Go. Inside. Go.

33:24.508 --> 33:26.043
Inside!

33:33.391 --> 33:35.262
Police!

33:35.295 --> 33:38.569
Make yourself known right now.

34:21.555 --> 34:23.692
‐Yeah!
‐Jesus Christ.

34:23.726 --> 34:25.295
‐Who are you? What are you...

34:25.328 --> 34:28.234
‐What are doing here?
‐But can you play "Chopsticks"?

34:28.268 --> 34:29.704
I'm Mrs. Blackwell.

34:31.140 --> 34:33.111
Principal Blackwell.

34:33.144 --> 34:34.514
Sam.

34:34.547 --> 34:36.350
You were...

34:37.720 --> 34:40.225
‐You're still here?
‐Of course.

34:40.258 --> 34:42.095
One day,
the children will be back.

34:44.466 --> 34:46.571
Well, that was impressive.

34:46.605 --> 34:47.874
Is that what you did before?

34:47.907 --> 34:50.178
Uh, music? Uh...

34:50.211 --> 34:52.215
No. Uh...

34:52.249 --> 34:54.253
I was an artist, kind of,

34:54.286 --> 34:57.225
‐but not this.
‐What kind of an artist?

34:57.259 --> 35:00.332
‐The struggling kind.
‐Well, that doesn't
really narrow it down.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.704
No. Um...

35:03.806 --> 35:05.576
It was performance art.

35:05.610 --> 35:07.680
‐It was theater.
‐And now?

35:10.385 --> 35:12.456
Um...

35:12.489 --> 35:14.226
I'm leaving. I'm sorry.

35:14.259 --> 35:17.567
Take your time.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.604
It's okay.

35:24.514 --> 35:26.885
"Play it again, Sam."

35:28.622 --> 35:31.427
This has been the highlight
of my day.

35:49.597 --> 35:52.269
‐Fuck me.

35:57.647 --> 35:59.517
Okay, a‐are you
counting illiterate?

35:59.551 --> 36:02.724
‐This is 29, not 25.
‐I'm sorry. I'll start over.

36:02.757 --> 36:04.460
You said
you would put the fire out

36:04.493 --> 36:06.464
‐before we went to bed
last night.
‐I never said that.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.635
‐Who heard Nicky say that?
‐Oh, so, what?

36:08.669 --> 36:10.773
‐All of this is my fault, then?
‐Come on, it's nobody's fault.

36:10.806 --> 36:12.844
‐It's nobody's fault.
‐She said she'd put it out,
and she didn't.

36:12.877 --> 36:14.814
The whole goddamn building
went up in flames.

36:14.848 --> 36:15.783
Well, maybe
if you weren't so fucked‐up

36:15.816 --> 36:17.486
‐last night, Jodi.
‐Cut it out, I mean it.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.423
‐- Yeah.
‐- Fuck off, Roxanne.

36:19.456 --> 36:21.293
‐What did you say? Say it again.
‐You heard me.

36:21.327 --> 36:22.764
‐See? You see what I mean?
‐Yeah, I do.

36:22.797 --> 36:24.734
We could go back
to the house.

36:24.768 --> 36:26.671
‐- There's no food.
‐- Okay.

36:26.705 --> 36:29.343
A couple days' walk
to the Baltimore camp.

36:29.376 --> 36:30.780
What about everyone else?

36:30.813 --> 36:32.449
There's not enough food
for everyone...

36:42.837 --> 36:44.306
You okay?

36:44.339 --> 36:46.343
Not really.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.349
Yeah.

37:02.710 --> 37:05.716
My mom and I never got along.

37:07.720 --> 37:12.395
I left home when I was 17
and, uh, never came back.

37:13.866 --> 37:15.736
She died a few years later,

37:15.770 --> 37:18.408
‐and every day si...
‐What are you
fucking talking about?

37:22.750 --> 37:24.587
I know your mom a little bit.

37:24.621 --> 37:26.725
I know how tough she can be.

37:26.758 --> 37:29.496
But I promise you,
whatever happened,

37:29.531 --> 37:32.369
she forgives you.

37:32.402 --> 37:34.574
We can leave tonight.

37:34.607 --> 37:36.611
I know the way.
I can get us to the Pentagon

37:36.645 --> 37:38.649
‐in a couple...
‐I'm not going there.

37:42.456 --> 37:44.694
WOMAN
...we see what happens
when a woman isn't listened to.

37:44.727 --> 37:47.867
I can't even look at him,
the psychopath.

37:47.900 --> 37:50.271
MAN You want to take
the perp walk or should I?

40:31.895 --> 40:34.199
What is wrong with people?

41:27.773 --> 41:30.111
‐No! No!

42:58.955 --> 43:00.258
Ah.

43:22.302 --> 43:25.108
None of this
is salvageable.

43:25.141 --> 43:26.744
I don't know
if you know this,

43:26.778 --> 43:29.817
but I used to work in politics.

43:29.851 --> 43:32.255
You have
a communications problem.

43:32.288 --> 43:34.660
I'm pretty tired, Nora.

43:34.694 --> 43:35.963
Can we talk about this later?

43:35.996 --> 43:38.234
We're gonna talk
about it now.

43:40.839 --> 43:43.077
It's smart,
as a jumping‐off point.

43:43.110 --> 43:46.250
A common enemy. Men.

43:46.283 --> 43:47.920
And with the histories
of the women here,

43:47.953 --> 43:49.824
I mean, that was
compelling to them.

43:49.857 --> 43:51.226
What the fuck
are you talking about?

43:51.260 --> 43:53.030
The problem is, the men
who beat the shit out of them,

43:53.063 --> 43:54.967
who made their lives miserable,

43:55.001 --> 43:56.403
they're all dead.

43:56.436 --> 43:58.942
And it wasn't
your magnetic personality

43:58.975 --> 44:01.380
and leadership skills
that kept these women around.

44:01.413 --> 44:04.252
You had stuff they wanted,
and that's about it.

44:06.089 --> 44:07.893
I don't have time
for this right now.

44:07.927 --> 44:09.831
Honestly?

44:09.864 --> 44:11.901
I don't know
why you're still here.

44:11.935 --> 44:14.139
You need me.
You just don't know it yet.

44:14.172 --> 44:16.210
Oh, yeah?
Why would I need you?

44:16.243 --> 44:18.414
Because I know how
to get them to stay.

44:19.984 --> 44:22.055
Your instincts are strong,

44:22.088 --> 44:24.794
but you're not as good a liar
as you think you are.

44:27.766 --> 44:30.672
I went for a walk
down by the river,

44:30.706 --> 44:31.975
and I saw
something interesting.

44:32.008 --> 44:33.979
What were you doing
outside the perimeter?

44:34.012 --> 44:35.949
‐I found that police car.
‐You found that police car?

44:35.983 --> 44:37.720
‐That's right.
‐What police car?

44:37.753 --> 44:39.222
You killed those people,
didn't you?

44:39.256 --> 44:41.661
You sound insane.

44:42.997 --> 44:45.401
Whatever it is
that you think you know...

44:49.109 --> 44:51.915
The only thing
that will keep you

44:51.948 --> 44:54.286
safe out there...

44:54.319 --> 44:55.989
is numbers.

44:56.023 --> 44:58.360
You don't need the building.

44:58.394 --> 45:00.064
You need the people.

45:00.097 --> 45:01.266
But to keep them,

45:01.300 --> 45:04.005
you're gonna need more
than "men suck."

45:06.811 --> 45:08.414
What do you expect to get
out of this, I wonder?

45:08.447 --> 45:10.886
I'm in the inner circle
from now on.

45:10.919 --> 45:12.422
You run things by me.

45:12.455 --> 45:14.894
And I want privileges.

45:14.927 --> 45:16.430
Mack and I eat first.

45:16.463 --> 45:18.935
‐That's not how we do it.
‐Well, if there's not enough

45:18.969 --> 45:20.839
to go around, you'll make sure
there's enough for us.

45:20.872 --> 45:22.242
We get first dibs on everything.

45:22.275 --> 45:25.081
And you'll never talk about

45:25.114 --> 45:27.886
my husband or my son...

45:33.097 --> 45:34.232
...ever again.

45:35.434 --> 45:37.005
It's up to you.

45:37.038 --> 45:40.244
You can go out there
and tell them the truth.

45:40.278 --> 45:42.816
About what you are.

45:44.452 --> 45:46.824
Or...

45:46.858 --> 45:48.929
you can go out there

45:48.962 --> 45:54.039
and be the thing
you so desperately want...

45:54.072 --> 45:55.842
to be.

45:57.078 --> 45:59.850
You don't get
to fire people.

45:59.884 --> 46:01.086
I don't know how many times
I got to tell you that.

46:01.119 --> 46:02.422
But if you had been there,

46:02.455 --> 46:03.525
‐you would've done the same...
‐It's too much of

46:03.558 --> 46:04.894
an ass‐ache for me.

46:04.927 --> 46:06.430
‐It ain't gonna happen.
‐Terry,

46:06.463 --> 46:08.568
‐I am...
‐Assistant Manager.

46:08.601 --> 46:11.106
Assistant.
This is a you fuckup.

46:11.139 --> 46:12.275
‐Don't you forget that.

46:12.308 --> 46:13.444
Travis.

46:13.477 --> 46:16.116
Stop drawing titties on
the mirrors in the break room.

46:16.149 --> 46:18.253
Oh. Okay.

46:18.287 --> 46:20.491
The breast drawings are
not the issue.

46:20.525 --> 46:23.063
He grabbed
Jenna B's rear end!

46:23.097 --> 46:24.934
‐Well, I don't hear her
complaining.

46:24.967 --> 46:26.871
She doesn't have to,
because I did, formally.

46:26.904 --> 46:28.107
If you could read,

46:28.140 --> 46:29.476
‐you might've seen it.
‐Goddamn it, Roxanne.

46:29.510 --> 46:31.480
That's enough
of your petty shit.

46:31.514 --> 46:32.916
I can read, Terry.

46:32.950 --> 46:34.386
‐Just so you know.
‐I don't care.

46:34.419 --> 46:37.358
And knock it off with the dick
pics, too. You're on notice.

46:37.392 --> 46:38.494
I get one more
complaint about you,

46:38.528 --> 46:41.333
I'm gonna start taking shifts
away. You understand?

46:41.366 --> 46:43.037
Yeah, Terry. Okay.

46:43.070 --> 46:44.507
Good. Go away.

46:48.581 --> 46:50.117
That is not gonna do anything.

46:50.151 --> 46:51.286
He's just gonna keep on...

46:51.320 --> 46:52.823
Goddamn it, Roxanne.

46:52.856 --> 46:55.127
I spend half my day
managing your bullshit.

46:55.161 --> 46:56.430
He's just a kid.

46:56.463 --> 46:57.432
Cut him some slack.

46:57.465 --> 46:59.502
He's 30 years old, Terry.

46:59.537 --> 47:01.106
He and Jenna have been
playing grab‐ass all year.

47:01.139 --> 47:03.177
She likes the attention.

47:03.210 --> 47:05.081
Until she complains...

47:05.114 --> 47:06.517
She's a frickin' teenager,
Terry.

47:06.551 --> 47:07.519
She doesn't want
to make trouble.

47:07.553 --> 47:10.525
Well, maybe you could
learn something from her.

47:10.559 --> 47:12.563
Look, I get it.

47:12.596 --> 47:14.399
You've been here a long time,

47:14.432 --> 47:16.336
and you used to kind of
be the belle of the ball.

47:16.370 --> 47:20.444
Are you saying that
I am jealous of Jenna?

47:20.478 --> 47:22.315
Are you serious?

47:22.348 --> 47:23.618
I'm just saying,

47:23.651 --> 47:25.321
maybe you came back too soon?

47:25.354 --> 47:28.460
Maybe you need to take
a few more weeks to rest?

47:28.494 --> 47:30.932
Oh, yeah? How am I gonna
pay my frickin' bills?

47:30.966 --> 47:33.505
Look, I wasn't gonna
say anything, but...

47:33.538 --> 47:35.307
Brittany saw you
steal a box set.

47:35.341 --> 47:39.282
‐I did not steal any...
‐Law & Order, season ten.

47:39.315 --> 47:43.257
I‐I know you've been
strapped for cash since Eddie,

47:43.290 --> 47:46.229
but that's a fireable offense.

47:47.966 --> 47:50.104
It was in
the bargain bin, okay?

47:50.137 --> 47:51.874
‐The package was...

47:51.908 --> 47:52.976
You know, you can pretty much
watch Law & Order

47:53.010 --> 47:54.145
whenever you want.

47:54.179 --> 47:56.383
Just turn on the TV,
and there it is.

47:56.416 --> 47:58.387
Now my hands are tied.

47:58.420 --> 48:00.057
I got to put you
on notice, too.

48:01.293 --> 48:04.132
Jesus Christ, Terry. Really?

48:04.165 --> 48:05.167
I don't know what
you want me to tell you.

48:05.201 --> 48:06.971
You want to be in charge?
Go work somewhere else.

48:08.508 --> 48:11.012
Now, I don't pay you to
sit there and complain all day.

48:11.046 --> 48:13.117
Get your ass out there.

48:18.995 --> 48:20.665
Okay, so, this one

48:20.699 --> 48:23.404
is will, and this one

48:23.437 --> 48:25.107
is logic.

48:25.141 --> 48:26.544
But your will line is bigger.

48:26.577 --> 48:27.913
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.

48:32.221 --> 48:34.292
I'm not dumb, you know.

48:34.325 --> 48:36.363
Shit. Um...

48:37.498 --> 48:38.635
Kelsey, I didn't mean that.

48:38.668 --> 48:39.670
‐I was...
‐You know, Hero,

48:39.703 --> 48:42.375
you can't get to know someone

48:42.408 --> 48:44.212
unless you give 'em a chance.

48:44.245 --> 48:46.116
You're right.

48:49.189 --> 48:50.926
Okay.

48:58.040 --> 48:59.543
Oh, my God.

48:59.577 --> 49:01.213
That's the Ring of Solomon.

49:02.215 --> 49:03.283
Is that a bad thing?

49:03.317 --> 49:05.154
No.

49:05.187 --> 49:07.726
That means you'll serve others
for the good of mankind.

49:09.763 --> 49:13.203
That doesn't sound like me.

49:13.237 --> 49:14.439
Yes, it does.

49:15.474 --> 49:18.046
Hey, everybody, listen up.

49:23.591 --> 49:27.231
What happened here is a tragedy.

49:27.265 --> 49:30.104
Y'all know I had a bout
of cancer a few years back.

49:30.137 --> 49:32.709
Took one of my tits.

49:32.743 --> 49:35.080
Lost my health insurance,
my life savings,

49:35.114 --> 49:37.285
bunch of fair‐weather friends.

49:37.318 --> 49:39.289
My husband left me...

49:39.322 --> 49:42.295
few months into the treatment,
couldn't take the heat.

49:42.328 --> 49:45.000
Fuck him, he wasn't some prize,
but that didn't feel good.

49:45.034 --> 49:47.706
I could've given up right then,

49:47.739 --> 49:49.677
thrown in the towel, you know?

49:49.710 --> 49:52.315
What's a broke,
45‐year‐old woman

49:52.348 --> 49:56.189
with one tit and no man
good for in this fucking world?

49:56.223 --> 49:58.528
‐You ever heard of the Amazons?
‐From...

49:58.561 --> 50:00.732
‐from Wonder Woman.
‐No, no,

50:00.765 --> 50:02.435
the originals.

50:02.468 --> 50:04.005
Greek mythology.

50:04.038 --> 50:05.307
Warrior women.

50:05.341 --> 50:06.677
Daughters of gods.

50:06.711 --> 50:09.650
Whole city of women,
living on the bank of a river.

50:09.683 --> 50:11.654
And they made their own rules.

50:11.687 --> 50:13.758
And when people fucked with
them, when men fucked with them,

50:13.791 --> 50:15.227
they never backed down.

50:15.261 --> 50:17.365
They were killers. Conquerors.

50:17.398 --> 50:18.300
Sliced off one of their tits

50:18.333 --> 50:19.670
so their arrows
would shoot straighter.

50:21.072 --> 50:24.212
I learned about that
after my cancer,

50:24.245 --> 50:26.784
when I was picking myself
back up,

50:26.817 --> 50:28.588
looking at all
the pieces of my life,

50:28.621 --> 50:30.491
trying to figure out
what any of it was for.

50:30.525 --> 50:32.495
And instead of giving up,

50:32.529 --> 50:34.365
I thought about them.

50:35.535 --> 50:37.739
There are so many
women out there

50:37.773 --> 50:40.211
who still think
that they have lost something.

50:40.244 --> 50:42.381
But not us.

50:42.415 --> 50:44.720
We celebrate
the absence of fear.

50:44.753 --> 50:46.122
We embody it.

50:46.156 --> 50:49.530
This is an opportunity
to take what we deserve,

50:49.563 --> 50:51.366
to be fearless.

50:51.399 --> 50:53.136
Let the rest of them cower.

50:53.170 --> 50:55.508
That is all
that they were taught.

50:55.542 --> 50:57.111
But not us.

50:57.144 --> 50:59.349
We are warrior women,

50:59.382 --> 51:00.785
daughters of the Amazons,

51:00.819 --> 51:03.791
and this is our world now!

51:03.825 --> 51:05.595
‐Yeah!

51:07.231 --> 51:09.302
Yeah!

51:16.416 --> 51:18.387
‐Hell yeah!

51:21.426 --> 51:22.829
Yeah!
