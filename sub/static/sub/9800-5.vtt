00:41.038 --> 00:42.858
Cute an cuddly, boys.

00:59.910 --> 01:00.910
Ready?

01:01.524 --> 01:02.545
Wait for it.

01:03.023 --> 01:04.358
Almost there.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.316
Now!

01:09.335 --> 01:13.189
Now begins the greatest
boogie-oogie-oogie than ever.

01:17.628 --> 01:20.169
Dance, my lemurs, dance!

01:21.265 --> 01:22.598
I like dancing.

01:26.605 --> 01:28.371
I don't like dancing.

01:29.333 --> 01:30.906
My feet are killing me.

01:31.074 --> 01:33.776
Not as much as I will
if you stop dancing.

01:34.213 --> 01:35.484
But, Your Majesty,

01:35.609 --> 01:38.069
we just can't boogie-oogie-oogie
like you.

01:38.292 --> 01:40.448
I want to go to bed.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.906
Last week, the baboons
shook their shiny red bottoms

01:46.031 --> 01:47.705
18 hours straight.

01:48.110 --> 01:50.151
I will not be out-partied.

01:57.669 --> 02:00.591
Roll out, team.
It's time to terminate that tune.

02:02.194 --> 02:03.019
Team?

02:06.874 --> 02:08.128
On your feet, Private.

02:09.616 --> 02:13.382
If that isn't the cutest thing!
Looks like I'm flying solo.

02:23.761 --> 02:25.494
You call that a booty shake?

02:30.534 --> 02:33.446
You must take the music
inside of you.

02:33.852 --> 02:35.559
Swish it around.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.174
And spit it out through your tail.

02:38.299 --> 02:39.663
Try it with me.

02:39.788 --> 02:41.801
Take in the music.

02:45.123 --> 02:48.396
- Not all the music, you greedies.
- It wasn't us.

02:48.521 --> 02:51.335
But what else could make a boomy box
stop booming?

02:53.507 --> 02:54.507
A thief!

02:55.999 --> 02:58.060
- Keep dancing.
- But there's no music!

02:58.185 --> 03:00.370
I'll pretend I did not hear that.

03:02.332 --> 03:04.539
Come back here, you music hater!

03:04.802 --> 03:07.003
I don't hate music.
I hate noise.

03:22.806 --> 03:23.806
Lost him.

03:34.291 --> 03:35.932
Mort, what are you doing?

03:36.057 --> 03:37.439
I'm dancing.

03:38.090 --> 03:39.263
Give it a rest.

03:39.388 --> 03:41.904
Julien has no way of knowing
if we're dancing or not.

03:45.060 --> 03:48.210
- He knows! He knows!
- I like dancing to exhaustion.

03:52.554 --> 03:54.634
Be giving it up, flightless bird.

03:54.759 --> 03:57.073
I already have three batteries.

03:57.198 --> 03:59.021
But your noisemaker needs all four.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.315
The only way you're getting this one
is if you pry it

04:02.440 --> 04:04.660
from my cold dead flippers.

04:05.921 --> 04:07.597
Sounds gross but doable!

04:19.730 --> 04:23.054
I win!
Into your face, penguin!

04:25.122 --> 04:26.349
Don't make a sound.

04:27.039 --> 04:28.618
We're in Joey's pen.

04:28.991 --> 04:29.991
Who's Joey?

04:31.302 --> 04:32.715
That's Joey.

04:38.207 --> 04:39.744
A kangaroo?

04:40.569 --> 04:41.673
How cute.

04:42.137 --> 04:44.900
For a moment there,
I thought it would be something dan...

04:48.731 --> 04:51.125
Now look, marsupial.
We don't want any trouble.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.467
We just came to get...

04:54.344 --> 04:57.246
Joey don't rightly appreciate
trespassers, mates.

04:57.539 --> 04:58.791
Makes me mad.

05:02.465 --> 05:03.753
Come down, you bludgers,

05:03.921 --> 05:05.621
before I chuck a wobbly.

05:06.736 --> 05:09.698
Have you never heard
such a mangling of the language

05:09.823 --> 05:11.093
which we are speaking?

05:11.417 --> 05:12.811
Anyhoo, fear not.

05:13.042 --> 05:16.365
I have loyal subjects who live
to sacrifice their skins for me.

05:20.550 --> 05:22.537
I'm dancing!
I'm still dancing!

05:24.883 --> 05:26.771
They are not running
when I am bellowing.

05:26.896 --> 05:28.511
I shall punish them harshly.

05:29.813 --> 05:31.708
Okay, crazy-ish idea.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.428
You help me

05:33.553 --> 05:35.284
get out of this place.

05:35.452 --> 05:37.119
Team up... with you.

05:37.354 --> 05:38.932
I was thinKing more like

05:39.057 --> 05:41.212
you do all of the work,

05:41.422 --> 05:44.106
and I will watch with anticipation.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.526
Well, then forget it, compadre.

05:47.816 --> 05:49.832
It's every animal for himself.

06:00.746 --> 06:01.946
Okay, you win.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.533
Go team.
First we'll need a plan.

06:09.008 --> 06:10.586
Here goes nothing.

06:14.433 --> 06:16.199
What do you know?
It actually...

06:21.031 --> 06:24.100
Not in the face.
Please spare my moneymaker.

06:29.592 --> 06:31.195
All systems go.

06:33.110 --> 06:35.344
Where do you two dingoes
think you're going?

06:39.955 --> 06:42.882
Kangaroo!
You cannot be bouncing this high

06:43.007 --> 06:45.021
- while I can.
- Easy, ringtail.

06:45.426 --> 06:48.981
Yes, I can do all the bouncing
I choose up here.

06:49.726 --> 06:50.684
Ringtail!

06:50.809 --> 06:53.042
Are you not seething with jealousy

06:53.167 --> 06:56.051
as I bounce and bounce
and bounce some more?

06:57.050 --> 06:59.535
Look at my bouncing magnificence!

07:04.799 --> 07:07.517
Did anyone ever tell you
you have beautiful eyes?

07:08.098 --> 07:10.026
Please not to be hitting me.

07:10.151 --> 07:11.501
No worries, mate.

07:20.546 --> 07:24.424
Skipper, if only one of us
can make it out of here,

07:25.095 --> 07:27.530
let it be... Joey.

07:27.698 --> 07:28.598
Wait, Joey?

07:29.412 --> 07:32.001
Without the beatings,
this place wouldn't be half bad.

07:32.527 --> 07:33.869
We're getting out of here

07:34.441 --> 07:37.440
thanks to this handsome fella
and his little dummy friend.

07:37.608 --> 07:41.477
You have failed
to capture my regal profile.

07:41.645 --> 07:44.823
Joey only needs to buy it
for a few precious moments.

07:45.015 --> 07:46.383
You see, every morning,

07:46.508 --> 07:48.584
that gate automatically
opens for breakfast.

07:48.752 --> 07:50.461
At precisely 0600 hours,

07:50.774 --> 07:52.471
we use our decoys and we break.

07:52.923 --> 07:55.143
Fast.
Get my drift?

07:55.886 --> 07:59.195
No, this is too long.
I cannot wait 600 hours.

07:59.685 --> 08:01.464
0600 means 6:00 a.m.

08:02.391 --> 08:03.266
When is that?

08:03.618 --> 08:06.636
From reading the sun correctly,
i'd say...

08:08.230 --> 08:09.405
- Now.
- Now?

08:09.573 --> 08:10.773
Now! Now! Now!

08:12.610 --> 08:14.993
Nobody pushes a King out of a tree.

08:20.017 --> 08:22.218
Give you two
a proper harrying, I will.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.180
Hey, look what I...

08:31.595 --> 08:32.561
I've been had.

08:43.208 --> 08:45.374
Everyone who is important to me
made it.

08:45.797 --> 08:47.087
Happy ending.

08:48.458 --> 08:51.257
But what is this feeling
I am feeling?

08:51.572 --> 08:53.449
It is not a happiness.

08:54.253 --> 08:55.496
Is that the best you...

08:56.694 --> 08:59.795
It is a feeling that I have not done
all I should have done.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.073
I do not like it.

09:01.701 --> 09:03.492
How do I make it go away?

09:18.408 --> 09:20.021
Please do hurry, penguin.

09:21.020 --> 09:23.245
I am not used to the physical labor.

09:23.913 --> 09:24.747
Trying.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.605
I cannot hold it much longer.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.753
What more can I,

09:29.878 --> 09:32.355
a devilishly handsome
lemur King, do?

09:41.496 --> 09:43.232
Hurry! Hurry!

09:49.223 --> 09:50.640
What's the matter, wallaby?

09:51.337 --> 09:53.075
Can't kick a moving target?

09:53.243 --> 09:55.645
Wallaby?
I'm a kangaroo, mate!

10:03.612 --> 10:05.488
I've been had again.

10:05.656 --> 10:07.608
We did it! Up high.

10:08.537 --> 10:09.392
Yes, it is.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.133
Down low.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.863
Too slow?

10:14.132 --> 10:16.119
You... You are too slow.

10:16.862 --> 10:17.965
Nevermind.

10:20.416 --> 10:24.393
And so,
I bravely saved the annoying penguin.

10:25.903 --> 10:27.109
But at what cost?

10:27.378 --> 10:28.772
Without my battery,

10:29.004 --> 10:31.814
our booties are sad and still.

10:32.276 --> 10:34.692
That's a crying shame, Your Majesty.

10:36.365 --> 10:37.503
Shame.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.327
Look alive, lemurs.

10:40.872 --> 10:42.792
This is no way to party down.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.913
True that.

10:44.038 --> 10:47.430
Your wisdom exceeds your years,
my flippered friend.

10:47.686 --> 10:51.067
What is a party without mad beats
to rock the streets?

10:51.235 --> 10:53.197
That's why you need this.

10:57.019 --> 10:58.019
For me?

10:58.738 --> 11:01.376
I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna cry.

11:01.810 --> 11:03.541
Consider it a tip of the beak

11:03.808 --> 11:05.121
for saving my tail.

11:07.630 --> 11:09.500
Now squeeze in there
with your friends.

11:10.313 --> 11:12.218
The monster beats rage on!

11:12.439 --> 11:13.973
Boogie, my subjects!

11:15.239 --> 11:15.992
Boogie.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.110
How can you boys still be sleeping?

11:25.235 --> 11:26.636
On your feet, team.

11:27.571 --> 11:28.404
What?

11:28.722 --> 11:30.473
Earmuffs?
Well, I'll be.

11:30.641 --> 11:32.642
Only way to catch
quality sack time, here.

11:34.952 --> 11:37.413
Rico, did you forget
to gave Skipper his?

11:40.249 --> 11:41.317
Thanks, boys.

11:43.947 --> 11:44.820
Bliss.
