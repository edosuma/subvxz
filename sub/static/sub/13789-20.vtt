WEBVTT

00:05.176 --> 00:07.007
So you ever have
an old dog bed,

00:07.007 --> 00:09.300
and you weren't sure
what to do with it?

00:09.300 --> 00:10.551
Well, here's
a fun project.

00:13.344 --> 00:16.227
You didn't fly in
your dog bed for real, did you?

00:16.227 --> 00:20.401
How else would I have
gotten this jar of cloud?

00:20.401 --> 00:23.064
I'm usually very good at
identifying types of clouds,

00:23.064 --> 00:25.316
but this doesn't look like
a bunny rabbit,

00:25.316 --> 00:27.198
a marshmallow,
or a snowman.

00:27.198 --> 00:31.782
You have a very rare
specimen here, my friend.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.954
But Stan, you can't
do crazy stuff like this

00:33.954 --> 00:35.536
now that you're
a father.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.458
You're gonna set
a bad example for
your puppies.

00:37.458 --> 00:39.290
Come on, Tyler.

00:39.290 --> 00:42.293
My puppies aren't gonna
just blindly copy what I do.

00:42.293 --> 00:44.085
Whee!

00:45.666 --> 00:48.089
No dog bed,
no cloud-catching jar,

00:48.089 --> 00:50.551
totally different.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.933
I can see
our house from here.

01:11.362 --> 01:14.285
Oh, Princess, I'm gonna
miss you so much.

01:14.285 --> 01:15.656
Ever since we were married,

01:15.656 --> 01:17.998
we frolicked together
every single day.

01:17.998 --> 01:20.251
I can tug on a rope
with Tyler, Avery and Chloe

01:20.251 --> 01:21.662
while you're gone,

01:21.662 --> 01:23.794
but they don't growl
the way you do.

01:23.794 --> 01:25.166
Well, Avery comes close.

01:25.166 --> 01:28.169
[growls]

01:28.169 --> 01:30.341
[whispers]
She doesn't come close,

01:30.341 --> 01:33.264
but I didn't wanna
hurt her feelings.

01:33.264 --> 01:35.266
Is Princess
going somewhere?

01:35.266 --> 01:37.308
Yeah. Heather's
going away for a month

01:37.308 --> 01:39.600
to some fancy school
that allows pets.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.273
They have all kinds of
salon treatments for dogs.

01:42.273 --> 01:44.525
Princess wants
a Brazilian blowout,

01:44.525 --> 01:47.528
because curly hair
is impossible, girl.

01:48.989 --> 01:51.192
That's what Princess
says with her eyes.

01:51.192 --> 01:53.864
I'm gonna miss her
so much.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.196
[doorbell rings]

01:58.199 --> 01:59.620
Is Princess
ready to go?

01:59.620 --> 02:02.623
I'm already tired
of looking at you.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.296
If I were
your career counselor,

02:05.296 --> 02:07.798
I'd advise you to become
a hermit, social pariah,

02:07.798 --> 02:10.010
or village monster.

02:10.010 --> 02:12.713
Like I'd live in
a village.

02:13.924 --> 02:15.216
Come, Princess.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.472
I can't believe
she's gone.

02:21.472 --> 02:23.103
I don't even know
who I am without her.

02:23.103 --> 02:24.605
- Stan...
- No.

02:24.605 --> 02:26.397
Stan is the name of
a happy-go-lucky fella

02:26.397 --> 02:28.068
with love in his heart.

02:28.068 --> 02:29.610
My name is
Mr. Pembleton,

02:29.610 --> 02:32.032
a bitter accountant
whose wife went out for mustard

02:32.032 --> 02:34.445
and never came back.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.487
I know that you're sad,

02:36.487 --> 02:39.660
but maybe this
will cheer you up.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.413
[growls]

02:42.413 --> 02:44.285
[spits]

02:44.285 --> 02:46.497
This is the one
we found at the dog park.

02:46.497 --> 02:48.669
What was I thinking?

02:50.591 --> 02:52.593
And when I snap
my fingers,

02:52.593 --> 02:55.055
you will awake from
your hypnotic state

02:55.055 --> 02:58.299
and no longer find
puns funny.

03:00.060 --> 03:04.104
Wow, that was
a restful snap.

03:04.104 --> 03:06.687
- [chortles]
- Dang it.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.609
Good one, Ellen.

03:08.609 --> 03:11.482
Or was it?
Dang it.

03:11.482 --> 03:14.655
I need a parent to help me
post a video online.

03:14.655 --> 03:16.407
Chloe, it's not
a compilation

03:16.407 --> 03:19.159
of Daddy's epic
fails, is it?

03:19.159 --> 03:22.162
Because I think it was
the person who left
the rake in the driveway

03:22.162 --> 03:25.416
who really failed.

03:25.416 --> 03:27.288
No, they're holding
open auditions

03:27.288 --> 03:29.500
for the last movie in
the Necropolis High series.

03:29.500 --> 03:33.674
Necropolis High 7:
Heave Corpse Load.

03:33.674 --> 03:35.095
They're doing it
as two movies.

03:35.095 --> 03:38.509
It is too much
for one movie.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.341
The production company
is accepting auditions

03:40.341 --> 03:42.343
on their private site.

03:42.343 --> 03:44.845
Can I do it?
Please?

03:44.845 --> 03:48.399
Wow. Chloe, you've never
expressed an interest
in acting before.

03:48.399 --> 03:50.311
Please. All my friends
are auditioning.

03:50.311 --> 03:51.732
Bennett, all her friends
are doing it.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.484
We have to let her
do it.

03:53.484 --> 03:56.487
Acting is in our blood.

03:56.487 --> 04:00.120
With my background directing
Shakespeare in the Park,

04:00.120 --> 04:02.122
which was, and I quote,

04:02.122 --> 04:06.747
"not nearly as bad
as one might have expected."

04:06.747 --> 04:09.500
And after my community
theater turn

04:09.500 --> 04:11.962
as Blanche DuBois,
I was described as,

04:11.962 --> 04:16.176
and I quote,
"a last-minute replacement."

04:16.176 --> 04:17.428
So I can do it?

04:17.428 --> 04:21.051
No, Chloe.
We can do it.

04:21.051 --> 04:22.383
I'm gonna help you prepare.
What's the part?

04:22.383 --> 04:25.145
Wretch, the vomiting
underworld vagabond.

04:25.145 --> 04:27.438
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know about acting.

04:27.438 --> 04:30.060
and vomiting;
I've done both on stage.

04:30.060 --> 04:33.193
And I, Chloe,
can spur you

04:33.193 --> 04:35.816
to a performance
that is, and I quote again,

04:35.816 --> 04:38.989
"loud enough to hear."

04:38.989 --> 04:40.741
Really, Bennett?

04:40.741 --> 04:42.453
Do you really think
you're the best one--

04:42.453 --> 04:44.365
- Sleep.
- [snoring]

04:44.365 --> 04:46.367
Chloe, I can help you.

04:46.367 --> 04:48.168
Can you teach me
that trick?

04:48.168 --> 04:49.830
Your daddy's a pretty
good hypnotist.

04:49.830 --> 04:52.833
And your mommy's
a pretty good actress.

04:58.128 --> 05:00.591
Stan, why are you wearing
sunglasses indoors?

05:00.591 --> 05:02.343
Not to hide
the shifty eyes

05:02.343 --> 05:05.926
that might give away
what I've done, that's for sure.

05:05.926 --> 05:08.929
I'm wearing them because
I've started a smooth jazz trio.

05:08.929 --> 05:10.561
It's me, Robert,

05:10.561 --> 05:12.022
and the ghost of
legendary vibraphonist

05:12.022 --> 05:15.566
Benny Jackson.

05:15.566 --> 05:18.899
We're called Princess
Is In the Storage Space.

05:18.899 --> 05:21.281
Wait, what? Princess
is in the storage space?

05:21.281 --> 05:22.863
Ah! What an unlucky
coincidence

05:22.863 --> 05:24.905
that that was the name
of our band.

05:24.905 --> 05:27.708
You wanna explain this?

05:27.708 --> 05:29.660
I couldn't stand
to be without her,

05:29.660 --> 05:30.911
so I smuggled her
away from Heather

05:30.911 --> 05:32.623
while she was
packing her car.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.415
Daddy got Mommy.

05:34.415 --> 05:38.128
My chew toy tastes
like Avery. Yuck!

05:38.128 --> 05:39.880
Stan, this isn't right.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.633
We have to call Heather.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.466
Sorry, Heather.
Princess must've just
wandered over here.

05:45.466 --> 05:47.428
I don't believe that
for a second.

05:47.428 --> 05:48.889
You people
are dog thieves.

05:48.889 --> 05:50.641
If we were trying
to steal Princess,

05:50.641 --> 05:51.932
why would I have called you
to come and get her?

05:51.932 --> 05:53.734
I said you were
dog thieves.

05:53.734 --> 05:56.567
I didn't say you were
highly skilled dog thieves.

05:59.690 --> 06:02.613
What have I been
telling you, Stan?

06:02.613 --> 06:04.865
You're a father.
You can't be
so irresponsible.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.288
Sneaking Princess back here
sets a bad example
for your puppies.

06:08.288 --> 06:09.910
I'm a bad example?

06:09.910 --> 06:11.492
You're the one who's
always on the furniture.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.206
I appreciate your concern.

06:16.206 --> 06:18.589
I know how
to raise my puppies.

06:18.589 --> 06:20.711
Still, I guess
if it makes you happy,

06:20.711 --> 06:23.634
I promise I won't take
Princess again.

06:23.634 --> 06:24.715
Stan.

06:26.507 --> 06:28.559
I know I promised,

06:28.559 --> 06:30.891
but I'm a jazz musician, man.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.853
We go where
the music takes us.

06:32.853 --> 06:35.516
[scat singing]

06:35.516 --> 06:37.688
I didn't even know
I was gonna do that.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.401
Caught you again.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.734
I called you!

06:46.196 --> 06:47.488
[doorbell rings]

06:50.701 --> 06:53.744
Heather? What is
going on?

06:53.744 --> 06:55.536
This morning,
at my school program,

06:55.536 --> 06:57.588
they told me Princess
failed to show up

06:57.588 --> 06:59.500
for her eyebrow threading.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.712
Princess is missing.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.544
I'm sure she must be here
since you people

07:03.544 --> 07:05.596
took her twice before.

07:05.596 --> 07:07.758
Officer, arrest this girl
for dog-napping.

07:07.758 --> 07:09.850
I am not a dog-napper.

07:09.850 --> 07:11.682
I'm not even
a regular napper.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.555
Once I wake up,
it's go, go, go
until bedtime.

07:14.555 --> 07:17.768
Officer, arrest this girl
for being annoying.

07:17.768 --> 07:20.521
If I could arrest someone
for being annoying, I would.

07:22.693 --> 07:25.866
I guarantee you,
Princess is not here.

07:30.370 --> 07:33.163
We got Mommy.

07:33.163 --> 07:35.666
What? How'd you guys
get her all the way back here?

07:35.666 --> 07:37.708
We texted you a picture.

07:40.791 --> 07:43.674
We spit on cats
from up there.

07:48.679 --> 07:50.390
Gracie, Freddy,
I can't believe

07:50.390 --> 07:52.553
you guys took Princess
from Heather's school.

07:52.553 --> 07:53.764
See, Stan. This is
what happens

07:53.764 --> 07:55.015
when you set
a bad example.

07:55.015 --> 07:56.767
They didn't do it
because of me.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.560
- We copied you, Daddy.
- Kids'll say anything.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.562
They believe in
sea monsters.

08:01.562 --> 08:05.526
We believe in
sea monsters if you
believe in sea monsters, Daddy.

08:05.526 --> 08:09.159
You're not helping
Daddy's cause, kids.

08:09.159 --> 08:11.241
Look, we have to
take her back.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.453
Heather's probably
worried sick about Princess.

08:13.453 --> 08:14.915
[Heather] I'm worried
sick about Princess.

08:14.915 --> 08:17.207
See? And she should know.

08:17.207 --> 08:18.999
Wait, what?

08:20.080 --> 08:22.332
You can search
this entire house.

08:22.332 --> 08:25.335
If you find Princess,
officer, you can arrest me

08:25.335 --> 08:27.628
and my entire family.

08:27.628 --> 08:29.760
But you might wanna
put me in solitary,

08:29.760 --> 08:31.632
because I'm a danger
to the general population.

08:31.632 --> 08:33.343
[giggling]

08:33.343 --> 08:35.345
I'm kidding.
I'd be very afraid in there.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.899
Heather is already here,

08:38.899 --> 08:40.851
and she brought
a police officer
to search the place.

08:40.851 --> 08:42.853
Quick, hide Princess
while I distract them.

08:42.853 --> 08:45.105
Or you could hide
Princess.

08:45.105 --> 08:47.407
There's nothing more
distracting than a dog

08:47.407 --> 08:49.449
with his jazz ensemble.
Let's go, Robert.

08:51.652 --> 08:53.914
No, Robert,
it is not a paying gig.

08:53.914 --> 08:56.076
But sometimes,
you have to play for free

08:56.076 --> 08:58.418
to build your fan base.

08:58.418 --> 09:01.872
Stan, Princess.
The police.

09:01.872 --> 09:03.714
[Avery] How about we start
with the kitchen?

09:03.714 --> 09:05.005
Come on, Princess.

09:06.967 --> 09:09.800
[chase music plays]

09:53.513 --> 09:56.056
So you've searched
this entire house,

09:56.056 --> 09:57.888
and you didn't
find anything.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.891
You even looked in my closet
and criticized my clothes,

10:00.891 --> 10:04.564
which I expected from Heather,
but not from you, officer.

10:04.564 --> 10:08.819
Sorry. Her negativity's
infectious.

10:08.819 --> 10:10.991
I know you did
something with Princess,

10:10.991 --> 10:13.363
but I can't prove it,
but I won't rest until...

10:13.363 --> 10:16.827
oh, my gosh, you're
so tiring to look at.

10:17.998 --> 10:20.290
Let's go, officer.

10:22.332 --> 10:24.915
Sorry about your toilet.

10:27.247 --> 10:29.880
Man, that was so close.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.923
We need to find a way
to sneak Princess back
into Heather's school

10:32.923 --> 10:34.885
without Heather
finding out.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.057
Otherwise, we could
all end up in jail.

10:37.057 --> 10:39.469
Stan, where were you
this whole time

10:39.469 --> 10:41.181
we were trying
to hide Princess?

10:41.181 --> 10:42.763
You didn't
help us at all.

10:42.763 --> 10:45.475
Yeah, I did.
I played the chase music.

10:45.475 --> 10:48.358
[humming chase music]

10:50.190 --> 10:51.982
It's the first track
off our new album.

10:51.982 --> 10:53.774
We're experimenting.

10:53.774 --> 10:55.906
I'm a little worried
our fans won't follow us

10:55.906 --> 10:59.489
- in this new direction.
- Yes, that's our problem
right now.

11:02.873 --> 11:04.785
Okay, Chloe,
let's see how

11:04.785 --> 11:06.997
your Necropolis High
audition is coming along.

11:06.997 --> 11:08.458
Show us
what you've got,

11:08.458 --> 11:09.790
and we will
mold it.

11:09.790 --> 11:11.922
Be that little
zombie Wretch.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.673
Transport us.

11:15.055 --> 11:16.596
[British accent]
Please, Mummy,

11:16.596 --> 11:18.348
I'm tired of eating brains.

11:18.348 --> 11:21.471
Can't I have cake
and oranges and brains

11:21.471 --> 11:23.563
like normal children?

11:27.067 --> 11:29.900
[normal voice]
This is a brain.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.813
Oh, it's a brain.

11:32.813 --> 11:34.444
[British accent]
I want to go to school

11:34.444 --> 11:36.116
with others like me.

11:36.116 --> 11:38.578
I want to go from
being a zom-B student

11:38.578 --> 11:40.821
to a zom-A student.

11:40.821 --> 11:42.953
Ha ha, I just got that.

11:43.954 --> 11:46.666
I want to go to
Necropolis High.

11:49.039 --> 11:53.043
Sweetie, as a parent,
that was absolutely wonderful.

11:53.043 --> 11:54.634
Really, really good.

11:54.634 --> 11:55.886
But as your director,
I think we got

11:55.886 --> 11:57.838
a lot of work
ahead of us.

11:57.838 --> 11:59.760
Really, really sketchy.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.012
Okay, Chloe, you need
to think about

12:02.012 --> 12:03.934
who your character is.

12:03.934 --> 12:05.435
- What does she want?
- Brains.

12:05.435 --> 12:07.267
- What is her weakness?
- Brains.

12:07.267 --> 12:08.939
- What is her
Buddy Bop password?
- Brains.

12:08.939 --> 12:11.311
Excellent.
Now do the scene.

12:11.311 --> 12:13.023
[British accent]
Please, Mummy,

12:13.023 --> 12:14.734
I'm tired of eating brains.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.447
Can't I have cake
and oranges and brains

12:17.447 --> 12:19.119
like normal children?

12:19.119 --> 12:20.450
Brains!

12:20.450 --> 12:23.073
Perfect. You see
the difference?

12:23.073 --> 12:25.285
Brains!

12:25.285 --> 12:28.869
Chloe, acting is not
about what a character wants.

12:28.869 --> 12:30.921
No one can see that.

12:30.921 --> 12:32.923
It's about expressions.

12:32.923 --> 12:36.967
Sad, angry, surprised.

12:36.967 --> 12:39.299
Now do the scene.

12:39.299 --> 12:41.301
[sadly]
Please, Mummy,

12:41.301 --> 12:43.263
I'm tired of
eating brains.

12:43.263 --> 12:47.187
[angrily] Can't I have cake
and oranges and brains

12:47.187 --> 12:51.271
[surprised]
like normal children?

12:52.652 --> 12:55.025
Honey, I think
you're confusing Chloe.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.897
Chloe? Who's Chloe?

12:56.897 --> 13:01.201
All I see is
a hideous little zombie girl.

13:01.201 --> 13:03.493
All I see is
a mother directing her child

13:03.493 --> 13:05.285
away from an Oscar.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.787
Away from it?
I think toward an Oscar
is what you meant to say.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.960
We need to go sneak
Princess into
Heather's school.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.621
Wanna come?

13:11.621 --> 13:13.333
I sure don't want
to stay here.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.088
I was once told I was
a less-attractive
Joan Fontaine.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.880
[arguing continues]

13:24.094 --> 13:26.266
Okay, we're gonna sneak
across the school grounds,

13:26.266 --> 13:27.597
and put Princess
back in Heather's room

13:27.597 --> 13:29.389
without anyone
seeing us.

13:29.389 --> 13:32.482
We're all suited up
and ready to go.

13:32.482 --> 13:35.896
Except for one person
who misunderstood the plan.

13:38.148 --> 13:40.150
I didn't misunderstand.
I'm the diversion.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.112
I'm gonna draw
attention to myself

13:42.112 --> 13:43.493
so you guys can
sneak through.

13:43.493 --> 13:46.036
Tyler, that is the most
ridic... actually,

13:46.036 --> 13:48.408
it kinda makes sense.

13:48.408 --> 13:50.160
Why didn't you say
something in the car

13:50.160 --> 13:52.002
when I was going on
and on about

13:52.002 --> 13:53.333
why you were wearing
a woopie cushion costume.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.086
I tried, but every time
you said "woopie,"

13:56.086 --> 13:59.009
I giggled.
[giggles]

13:59.009 --> 14:01.091
Woopie.

14:01.091 --> 14:04.424
We just have to
drop Princess off
like she never left.

14:04.424 --> 14:07.557
It's late enough.
The campus should be
pretty much deserted.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.102
Thank you all
for coming.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.813
It's a good thing the news
cares mostly about

14:13.813 --> 14:17.187
personal things
happening to rich people.

14:17.187 --> 14:19.069
So is the coast clear?

14:19.069 --> 14:20.981
In the words
of Lou Costello,

14:20.981 --> 14:23.653
ma-ma-ma-ma!

14:23.653 --> 14:24.945
I don't get
that reference.

14:24.945 --> 14:28.538
In the words of Lucy,
ugh!!

14:28.538 --> 14:29.749
Nope.

14:29.749 --> 14:31.791
The campus
is full of people.

14:31.791 --> 14:34.995
[as Jack Benny]
Well...

14:34.995 --> 14:36.416
You know Jack Benny?

14:36.416 --> 14:39.419
Who? I was just
doing Dad.

14:39.419 --> 14:42.092
Look, we have
big problems.

14:42.092 --> 14:44.804
The place is crawling
with media and police.

14:44.804 --> 14:48.008
There's no way we can
sneak Princess back
into Heather's school.

14:48.008 --> 14:50.060
British accent]
All the Wretch has to do

14:50.060 --> 14:52.182
is bite one person and the
zombie infection will spread.

14:54.354 --> 14:57.397
What? I've got other things
going on this week.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.320
All right, it's time for
my diversion.

15:00.320 --> 15:01.651
I'm gonna get the crowd
to follow me

15:01.651 --> 15:03.233
away from the school,

15:03.233 --> 15:04.904
so you guys can go
through the courtyard

15:04.904 --> 15:06.116
and put Princess
back in the dorm.

15:08.618 --> 15:10.290
Woopie-ki-ay!

15:11.741 --> 15:14.874
Who wants to sit on me?
Come on. Whoo!

15:17.877 --> 15:19.629
Really? Nothing?

15:19.629 --> 15:21.881
America's forgotten
how to laugh.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.885
All right, the bad news is
the diversion didn't work,

15:25.885 --> 15:27.757
Heather saw me,
and she's coming this way.

15:27.757 --> 15:30.180
- What's the good news?
- I never said
there was good news.

15:35.475 --> 15:37.227
All right, Stan,
you take Princess

15:37.227 --> 15:39.269
and the puppies,
and get them out of here.

15:39.269 --> 15:40.480
Heather's on her way over.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.861
Come on, family.

15:41.861 --> 15:43.113
Follow me into the woods.

15:43.113 --> 15:45.025
I have to go
to the bathroom.

15:45.025 --> 15:47.617
Then go.
We're not people.

15:52.122 --> 15:53.533
What are you
doing here?

15:53.533 --> 15:55.875
I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

15:55.875 --> 16:00.630
Ugh, what are you
doing here?

16:00.630 --> 16:02.342
Well, we were
very distraught

16:02.342 --> 16:03.793
that Princess is missing,

16:03.793 --> 16:05.715
so we came down
to help find her.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.797
And why are you
dressed like that?

16:07.797 --> 16:09.549
Because...

16:09.549 --> 16:12.802
Well, we formed a new
hip-hop group

16:12.802 --> 16:16.726
called Da Kommando Crew,

16:16.726 --> 16:19.309
featuring
MC Woopie Cushion.

16:19.309 --> 16:21.311
I don't believe you.

16:21.311 --> 16:23.103
I'm gonna have you
arrested.

16:23.103 --> 16:25.235
Oh, yeah?
Well, check it.

Concerned about
the situation with Princess,

17:10.200 --> 17:11.951
I've got an idea.

17:11.951 --> 17:14.364
I hid Princess
and the puppies
next to an old cavern.

17:14.364 --> 17:16.866
We could pretend
Princess is trapped in there,

17:16.866 --> 17:19.209
and you guys
could say that
you found her

17:19.209 --> 17:20.870
and return her
to Heather

17:20.870 --> 17:22.622
without being blamed
for her disappearance.

17:22.622 --> 17:24.874
- Great plan, Stan.
- I think this is
gonna work.

17:24.874 --> 17:27.167
- I guess so.
- What's the matter, Tyler?

17:27.167 --> 17:29.879
I'm beginning to think
I wore this woopie cushion
for nothing.

17:36.386 --> 17:38.678
You do realize, Ellen,

17:38.678 --> 17:41.391
that my years of
directing experience

17:41.391 --> 17:44.734
make me uniquely qualified
to help Chloe understand

17:44.734 --> 17:47.607
how the part of Wretch
should be played.

17:47.607 --> 17:50.240
Bennett, I have been
an unofficial understudy

17:50.240 --> 17:52.532
in multiple
theatrical productions.

17:52.532 --> 17:54.364
I'm in the front row,
in costume,

17:54.364 --> 17:55.745
ready to jump on stage

17:55.745 --> 17:57.747
if the actress ever
falls off stage

17:57.747 --> 17:59.749
after being distracted by
seeing someone in the front row

17:59.749 --> 18:01.961
dressed just like her.

18:01.961 --> 18:03.963
I think I know how
to play this part.

18:03.963 --> 18:05.335
Oh, really?

18:05.335 --> 18:07.337

around here somewhere,

18:48.958 --> 18:50.510
and so were Princess
and the puppies.

18:50.510 --> 18:53.253
And now, all of
those things are missing.

19:42.762 --> 19:46.936
Yeah, and Princess, Gracie
and Freddy are down here too.

We're all okay.

Oh, no.

19:58.318 --> 20:00.410
I'm so sorry.

20:00.410 --> 20:01.741
If I'd set
a better example,

you wouldn't have broken
your mommy out.

his children safe. I--

Daddy, can you
tell us this later

20:16.175 --> 20:19.509

stuck in a hole?

20:19.509 --> 20:21.180
Oh, right, yes.

and go get help.

is running out of air.

how much I love animals.

20:38.157 --> 20:39.569

a talking dog

and not being able
to talk.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.205
[barking continues]

20:46.205 --> 20:49.078

is trying to tell us something.

the handsome dog.

Follow those majestic
hindquarters.

21:01.471 --> 21:03.973
So you got Princess back.

21:03.973 --> 21:05.845
The media's calling
your dog a hero

21:05.845 --> 21:08.808
for finding Princess
in the cavern,
but I don't buy it.

21:08.808 --> 21:11.351
I still think
you stole Princess
and covered it up.

21:45.725 --> 21:48.057
From now on,
I'm gonna work so hard

21:48.057 --> 21:50.640
to be a good example
for my puppies.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.932
'Cause I realized
they're gonna follow my example

21:52.932 --> 21:55.144
whether I want them to
or not.

21:55.144 --> 21:59.359
Hey, you guys are blogging,
just like Daddy.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.571
I'm shooting birds.

22:01.571 --> 22:03.863
I'm bidding for things
online.

22:03.863 --> 22:06.155
If you put enough zeroes,
you always win.

22:06.155 --> 22:09.449
I got a boat!

22:09.449 --> 22:11.621
And my kids
aren't the only ones

22:11.621 --> 22:13.713
learning something
from a parent.

22:13.713 --> 22:16.456
Well, I saw online,
I didn't get the part.

22:16.456 --> 22:19.509
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

22:19.509 --> 22:21.220
You know, we went
online earlier

22:21.220 --> 22:23.132
and saw they were auditioning
for the parent roles.

22:23.132 --> 22:26.676
- You guys didn't get it.
- Oh, injustice!

22:29.889 --> 22:31.270
Actors.
