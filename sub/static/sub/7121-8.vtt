Jake.

00:44.558 --> 00:46.333
Wizard Battle is starting soon.

00:46.393 --> 00:48.202
I know!

00:48.262 --> 00:50.765
We got here six hours
early, you dork.

00:50.831 --> 00:53.334
Just wake me up when they
start selling hot dogs.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.038
Whoa! What do you know?

00:58.806 --> 01:00.080
The wizards are arriving!

01:03.677 --> 01:05.816
Whoo-hoo! YeahH

01:05.880 --> 01:07.951
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:09.516 --> 01:13.293
I am the grand master
wizard of ceremonies.

01:13.354 --> 01:16.699
And now... the rules!

01:16.757 --> 01:19.829
Contestants will fight each other
with spells from the eight

01:19.894 --> 01:21.737
schools of magic.

01:21.795 --> 01:24.139
No science, Science Whyzard!

01:25.532 --> 01:28.206
No weapons, Weaponhead!

01:28.269 --> 01:29.373
Hmph!

01:31.105 --> 01:36.248
To enter Wizard Battle,
you must be ...a wizard!

01:36.310 --> 01:37.983
Whoo, only wizards allowed!

01:38.045 --> 01:39.820
Whoo! Whoo!

01:39.880 --> 01:41.689
Wh... oh, what?

01:41.749 --> 01:42.887
Ice King!

01:42.950 --> 01:44.088
Boo!

01:44.151 --> 01:45.152
You're a contestant?

01:45.219 --> 01:46.220
Mm-hmm.

01:46.287 --> 01:47.766
You guys come here
to watch me win?

01:48.756 --> 01:49.632
You're gonna lose, man.

01:49.690 --> 01:50.532
You're a loser.

01:50.591 --> 01:51.433
Ha!

01:51.492 --> 01:52.596
I'm not gonna lose.

01:52.660 --> 01:54.936
I've got a foolproof
plan for winning.

01:54.995 --> 01:56.702
I'm gonna cheat.

02:01.535 --> 02:05.449
And now, L's and G's,
witness the unveiling of

02:05.506 --> 02:08.645
this tournament's Grand Prize...

02:08.709 --> 02:13.351
A kiss... from
Princess Bubblegum...

02:16.483 --> 02:17.723
on the mouth!

02:20.354 --> 02:22.197
Boo! Boo!

02:22.256 --> 02:23.564
Hmm.

02:23.624 --> 02:25.103
Is it an open-mouth kiss?

02:25.159 --> 02:26.229
No!

02:26.293 --> 02:28.398
Then I choose to
exit the battle.

02:28.462 --> 02:29.372
Yeah.

02:29.430 --> 02:30.534
Yeah.

02:30.597 --> 02:32.702
No one is allowed to
exit Wizard Battle!

02:34.768 --> 02:35.838
The doors are shut!

02:35.903 --> 02:37.940
The sky barrier is in place!

02:38.005 --> 02:42.977
All of you will kiss the
Princess or die in battle!

02:43.043 --> 02:46.252
Oh, I just can't wait to
taste that sweet Bubblegum.

02:47.715 --> 02:50.559
Jake, we got to enter the
contest and stop Ice King!

02:50.617 --> 02:52.119
But we're not wizards, mang.

02:52.186 --> 02:55.099
What about the sanctity and
honor of Wizard Battle'?

02:55.155 --> 02:58.329
I'd rather sanctify PB's lips.

02:58.392 --> 03:01.896
Ooh! You don't care
about the Ice King...

03:01.962 --> 03:04.704
You just want to kiss
Princess Bubblegum.

03:04.765 --> 03:06.745
No, I want to save the Princess!

03:06.800 --> 03:08.245
Mm-hmm.

03:08.302 --> 03:09.542
Yeah, you do.

03:09.603 --> 03:10.445
I do!

03:10.504 --> 03:11.710
Yeah, you do.

03:11.772 --> 03:12.910
Oh, shush!

03:17.478 --> 03:19.424
Now... where's the Ice King?

03:22.182 --> 03:23.182
Over there!

03:25.185 --> 03:26.459
Oh, yeah.

03:26.520 --> 03:27.794
We need a plan, man.

03:27.855 --> 03:30.335
Okay, when the wizards
start to battle,

03:30.391 --> 03:32.667
let's go hide behind that rock.

03:32.726 --> 03:38.369
By the rays of the setting sun,
the battle of wizards has...

03:38.432 --> 03:40.412
begun!

03:56.483 --> 03:59.020
Looks like everyone
had the same plan.

04:00.020 --> 04:01.060
What are they waiting for?

04:01.121 --> 04:02.395
The opposites.

04:02.456 --> 04:04.094
Huh?

04:04.158 --> 04:08.072
The wizards with opposite powers
will take each other on first.

04:08.128 --> 04:10.233
And... are you a wizard?

04:10.297 --> 04:15.474
Yes. My name is... Abracadaniel!

04:17.771 --> 04:19.079
Ugh!

04:20.908 --> 04:22.113
Hi, Abracadaniel.

04:22.176 --> 04:23.985
My name is, uh...

04:24.044 --> 04:26.524
Magic, uh, Fist.

04:26.580 --> 04:28.753
Whoa, this kid
looks like a wimp.

04:28.816 --> 04:30.090
Who is that?

04:30.150 --> 04:32.926
He's my uh, magic second head.

04:32.986 --> 04:35.159
Well, he's right.

04:36.690 --> 04:38.363
I only entered this contest

04:38.425 --> 04:41.269
'cause I thought the
prize would be money,

04:41.328 --> 04:43.274
but it's just a kiss!

04:43.330 --> 04:45.936
You mean... you don't
care about kissing PB?

04:45.999 --> 04:47.569
Ugh, no Way!

04:47.634 --> 04:51.411
If I were the winner, I would
turn my face so our lips

04:51.472 --> 04:55.318
Wouldn't touch, and I
would push Princess away.

04:55.375 --> 04:57.514
Turn... and push!

04:57.578 --> 05:00.024
Turn... and push!

05:00.080 --> 05:01.218
Turn... and push!

05:01.281 --> 05:02.123
This guy is great!

05:02.182 --> 05:03.786
Turn... and push!

05:03.851 --> 05:07.628
Well, I'm going back to my cave
to wait for someone to kill me.

05:07.688 --> 05:08.860
Good bye.

05:08.922 --> 05:11.869
Wait! Abracadanny, don't
you worry about a thing.

05:11.925 --> 05:13.131
I'm gonna protect you.

05:13.193 --> 05:14.137
You will?

05:14.194 --> 05:15.605
Yeah, man.

05:15.662 --> 05:19.166
Also, I have an idea for how you
can help me save PB's lips.

05:19.233 --> 05:20.678
Um, okay.

05:21.635 --> 05:23.137
Aaah!

05:23.203 --> 05:26.707
Oh! Look, opposites
are going to battle.

05:26.773 --> 05:27.615
Hyah!

05:27.674 --> 05:29.051
Cheating!

05:30.644 --> 05:31.850
He's using a weapon!

05:31.912 --> 05:34.518
Why isn't the Grand
Wizard seeing this?

05:36.683 --> 05:38.219
Nunchucks, vanish!

05:38.285 --> 05:39.730
Booyah!

05:39.786 --> 05:41.265
Now's my chance to stop him!

05:41.321 --> 05:42.561
Ooh.

05:42.623 --> 05:44.034
Aaah!

05:44.091 --> 05:45.091
Rock Wizard!

05:46.793 --> 05:49.637
Come to be, Meteor shower!

05:49.696 --> 05:51.676
Rock Wizard compels you!

05:51.732 --> 05:52.938
Cantrip!

05:53.000 --> 05:53.876
Huh?

05:53.934 --> 05:54.934
Mm!

05:54.968 --> 05:56.470
Aah!

05:57.437 --> 05:59.144
No!

05:59.206 --> 06:01.152
Jake, 2 o'clock!

06:02.709 --> 06:05.588
Okay, now to stop
the Ice Ki-i-i-ng?

06:05.646 --> 06:07.250
My body is squishy.

06:07.314 --> 06:08.691
That's how I survived.

06:08.749 --> 06:09.659
Whoa!

06:09.716 --> 06:10.717
That's turbo amazing!

06:10.784 --> 06:11.660
Hyah!

06:11.718 --> 06:13.527
Whaaaa!

06:13.587 --> 06:16.625
Stay close to me, Abracadaniel.

06:20.827 --> 06:22.306
Aaah!

06:23.931 --> 06:24.773
Cantrip!

06:24.831 --> 06:25.831
What?!

06:25.866 --> 06:27.140
You turned me pink, Bro!

06:27.201 --> 06:28.509
Ugh!

06:31.505 --> 06:33.985
Three wizards remain!

06:34.041 --> 06:35.987
Time to get real!

06:36.043 --> 06:40.014
I want to see some
crazy Wiz Biz!

06:42.549 --> 06:44.825
Wiz Biz! Wiz Biz!

06:44.885 --> 06:48.526
Oh, I can almost taste
those sweet lips!

06:48.589 --> 06:50.728
Wlllah! Wlllah!

06:51.825 --> 06:52.826
Quick, listen!

06:52.893 --> 06:54.213
Now's the time for
you to help me!

06:55.796 --> 06:57.332
Hey, guys. Guys?

06:57.397 --> 06:58.705
What are you whispering?

06:58.765 --> 06:59.641
Come on!

06:59.700 --> 07:01.839
I got a surprise
for youse fools!

07:01.902 --> 07:03.609
Yeah, that's right.

07:03.670 --> 07:05.946
Just a little closer.

07:06.006 --> 07:09.453
Ooh, what's in here, in
my little sleevie hole?

07:09.509 --> 07:10.544
Watch out, man!

07:10.611 --> 07:11.453
Whoo!

07:11.511 --> 07:12.511
You got this, Danny Boy!

07:14.248 --> 07:16.159
My nunchucks! No!

07:16.216 --> 07:17.216
Yes!

07:18.118 --> 07:19.062
I did it!

07:19.119 --> 07:20.120
I really did it!

07:20.187 --> 07:23.031
I'm a true wizard!

07:25.659 --> 07:28.799
I have powers too, you butts!

07:28.862 --> 07:29.704
Hyah!

07:29.763 --> 07:30.833
Ice sword!

07:30.897 --> 07:32.308
Ice shield!

07:32.366 --> 07:33.811
Abracadaniel!

07:34.901 --> 07:36.073
What? What'd you say?

07:36.136 --> 07:37.136
Ohm

07:40.207 --> 07:41.207
Good job, Danny.

07:41.241 --> 07:42.281
You're not a wimp anymore.

07:42.309 --> 07:43.481
You should feel pretty good.

07:43.543 --> 07:44.749
I do.

07:44.811 --> 07:48.452
I feel <i>real</i> good!

07:48.515 --> 07:49.721
I'm gonna forfeit now.

07:49.783 --> 07:51.194
I only wanted to
stop the Ice King.

07:51.251 --> 07:52.662
Unh-unh.

07:52.719 --> 07:53.857
I forfeit!

07:53.920 --> 07:55.024
I forfeit, everyone!

07:57.824 --> 07:58.859
Whoa!

07:58.925 --> 08:00.927
Abracadaniel wins!

08:00.994 --> 08:04.441
You are the greatest
wizard in Ooo!

08:04.498 --> 08:05.841
Oh! Ooh!

08:05.899 --> 08:08.243
Oh, thank you, Grand
Master Wizard.

08:08.302 --> 08:12.773
I guess, through this trial, I
have become a great wizard.

08:12.839 --> 08:16.150
I-I came here with no
self-esteem and no chances,

08:16.209 --> 08:21.522
a willow wisp of a boy, but I
walk out of this arena a man,

08:21.581 --> 08:28.465
a confident man who deserves
a kiss from a Princess!

08:34.561 --> 08:38.065
No-o-o-o-o-o!!

08:39.765 --> 08:42.837
It appears you have knocked out
Abracadaniel using the most

08:42.903 --> 08:47.443
shameful of all magic,
a power shriek.

08:48.809 --> 08:50.720
But since you are
the last wizard,

08:50.777 --> 08:53.519
you are the winner
of Wizard Battle!

08:54.681 --> 08:56.490
Go get ready for
your kiss, champ.

08:59.720 --> 09:00.824
Wow, man!

09:00.887 --> 09:01.922
What?

09:01.988 --> 09:04.025
I never heard you scream
like that before.

09:04.091 --> 09:07.072
You were all like, "No-o-o-o-o!

09:07.127 --> 09:10.904
No one kisses her but me-e-e-e!"

09:10.964 --> 09:13.843
Yeah, okay, I want to kiss her, all right?
You got me!

09:13.900 --> 09:15.072
The big secret is out!

09:15.135 --> 09:16.808
Okay, Jake! I like
Princess Bubblegum!

09:16.870 --> 09:18.349
Are you happy, Jake?!

09:22.075 --> 09:23.645
Whoa. Jake, don't cry, man.

09:23.710 --> 09:24.882
I'm not really mad at you.

09:26.413 --> 09:29.019
I'm just sick of having to
hide my feelings all the driz.

09:29.082 --> 09:30.527
It's exhausting.

09:30.584 --> 09:32.757
Then stop hiding
your feelings, man.

09:32.819 --> 09:34.457
Go out there and smooch it up!

09:34.521 --> 09:36.467
Yeah, all right, man.

09:38.625 --> 09:39.831
You ready in there?

09:39.893 --> 09:41.634
Yeah, I'm comin'!

09:43.130 --> 09:47.636
♪ Get ready for the
ultimate prize ♪

09:47.701 --> 09:52.707
♪ Watch her lips pout
before your eyes ♪

09:52.773 --> 10:00.248
♪ Never in your life would
you dream of this ♪

10:00.313 --> 10:03.783
♪ Never in your freaking life ♪

10:03.850 --> 10:04.692
Ugh!

10:04.751 --> 10:05.751
Whoa!

10:06.720 --> 10:07.926
Ow, dag.

10:07.988 --> 10:09.160
What's going on here?

10:09.222 --> 10:11.463
Uh, Ice King was
cheating his way through

10:11.525 --> 10:12.731
Wizard Battle using nunchucks,

10:12.793 --> 10:14.898
so Jake and I faked being
wizards to save you from

10:14.961 --> 10:15.996
having to kiss him.

10:16.063 --> 10:17.269
And... and we...

10:19.199 --> 10:20.837
I dishonored Wizard Battle.

10:20.901 --> 10:24.713
Oh, Finn, you did
all that for me?

10:26.573 --> 10:28.246
That's for being sweet...

10:29.309 --> 10:30.583
and that's for cheating.

10:30.644 --> 10:32.624
Finn, you know better than
to ruin the sanctity of

10:32.679 --> 10:33.919
Wizard Battle!

10:33.980 --> 10:36.392
Wizards only, silly.

10:36.450 --> 10:39.659
Okay, everyone, go home!

10:39.719 --> 10:41.790
Start getting ready
for next year!

10:43.890 --> 10:45.392
Meh.

10:45.459 --> 10:46.836
Oh, well.

10:46.893 --> 10:48.099
Good job.

10:48.161 --> 10:49.538
You got the kiss, man.

10:49.596 --> 10:50.802
Thanks, man.

10:50.864 --> 10:52.741
My face hurts a little.

10:52.799 --> 10:55.177
Don't worry about that,
'cause you look totally cool

10:55.235 --> 10:56.077
right now.

10:56.136 --> 10:56.978
Thanks, dude.

10:57.037 --> 10:57.981
Here, you try 'em.

10:58.038 --> 10:59.813
Okay. Am I cool now?

10:59.873 --> 11:01.944
So fly.
