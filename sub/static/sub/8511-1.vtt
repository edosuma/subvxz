WEBVTT

01:48.567 --> 01:50.728
We've had
a major containment breach.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.276
God. Oh, my god.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.774
Man: The security system
appears to be malfunctioning.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.949
Seal the base, campion.
If the main gate's still open, shut it.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.279
Yes, sir.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.985
Man:
We're dying like flies down here.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.036
Use the manual gate override,
campion.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.372
Do it now. Do it now!

02:06.543 --> 02:07.874
Sally, baby lavon.

02:08.003 --> 02:10.494
Man:
Campion. This is a code red.

02:10.714 --> 02:14.298
We've lost one of the bugs.
Repeat, we've lost one of the bugs!

02:14.509 --> 02:16.716
You have to close the gate!

02:18.472 --> 02:20.758
Sally! Sally!

02:20.932 --> 02:22.923
Sally! Sally: Charlie?

02:23.101 --> 02:24.370
Campion:
We gotta get out of here.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.830
Sally: What's going on?
You know what.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.081
Get the baby's stuff. Let's go.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.541
Sally: Oh, my god.
- Come on, let's go.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.272
Sally: I'm coming!
- Let's go, come on.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.692
Let's go.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.108
We'll be okay.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.692
Sally: Give me the baby. - Here.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.232
All right. I'll get it.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.360
All right, let's go.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.448
Sally: Come on, baby.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.871
Charlie.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.466
Slow down, Charlie.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.226
Charlie, slow down.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.641
Charlie, you're gonna get us all killed!

03:23.578 --> 03:24.863
Sorry, baby.

05:02.469 --> 05:08.009
Announcer:
Brought to you right here on blackout.

05:10.185 --> 05:14.349
And now here is the host
of blackout, Tom leary.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.388
Leary: Hey.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.815
Dj: All right, coming up next,

07:02.839 --> 07:05.922
we got Kathy camen goldmore,
America's new country sweetheart.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.715
Vic:
Sure wish she was my sweetheart.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.562
Hap: Why don't you listen to me,
you old man?

07:09.721 --> 07:12.508
Been listening to you
more than 20 years now, ain't 1?

07:13.099 --> 07:16.808
All that wisdom and I ain't rich yet.
Ha-ha-ha!

07:16.895 --> 07:19.807
Yeah. Well, if you learn
some simple economics.

07:19.981 --> 07:24.065
Bruett: Oh. Old man Vic thinks
"simple economics” is

07:24.986 --> 07:26.522
some hew breed of irishman.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.527
Vic: Hey. Ain't you ignorant?

07:29.240 --> 07:31.640
I think licking the glue off the back
of all them food stamps

07:31.785 --> 07:33.821
has finally done something
to your brain.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.987
Bruett: Well, I gotta feed
your daughter, don't I? Ha-ha-ha.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.660
Hap.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.872
Hap, shut off the pumps.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.165
Es == as = == ee seas me

08:10.115 --> 08:12.322
Bruett: Hey, you all right?

08:16.371 --> 08:18.202
Damn, St...

08:18.748 --> 08:22.115
You don't think he did that to his face
falling out of the car, did you?

08:22.335 --> 08:24.166
Stu: I doubt it.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.966
- Hey. Just take it easy now.
Campion: Jesus.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.963
Stu: Calm down.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.596
Hap.

08:34.806 --> 08:37.593
Phone rescue services
in braintree now. Hurry up.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.265
(0 on.

08:40.562 --> 08:43.474
Just take it easy, friend.
It's gonna be all right.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.769
- Just lie still now.
Vic: It's all right.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.816
Bruett: Ohh

08:51.740 --> 08:53.401
you'll be all right.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.401
It's gonna be all right.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.239
Ambulance will be here
in 10 minutes.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.204
Campion: My wife and my baby
are sick. They need help.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.370
Help my wife and baby.
They're sick, they need help.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.879
They're okay. They're fine.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.712
You just wanna sit right there.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.252
The ambulance is on its way.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.380
We didn't get out in time after all.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.262
Just try to rest yourself, okay?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.511
- Just take it easy now.
Campion: Gate malfunctioned.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.393
Otherwise, we'd have died
in the compound.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.353
Project blue.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.945
Take him aside, stu.
He's gonna toss it.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.487
Put your head down.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.945
Come on.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.998
Campion: And I told you I ain't got
time to throw a line on that dog tag.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.954
You mind me now.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.793
What's he got? You got any idea?

09:52.967 --> 09:55.807
Bruett: Maybe it's food poisoning.
You know, he's got California plates.

09:55.970 --> 10:00.213
He may have got some bad chow
at a roadside stand or something.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.722
Vic: I hope you're right.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.760
We've seen cholera back in '58
down near Nogales.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.474
This is what it looks like.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.599
Sally and the baby,
they were sick since salt lake city.

10:13.363 --> 10:17.322
Boy. Are you sure
Sally and my baby are okay?

10:17.742 --> 10:18.742
Yeah

10:18.910 --> 10:20.616
there was a man with us
some of the time.

10:20.787 --> 10:24.154
He was a dark man. He...

10:25.083 --> 10:27.290
I was looking through
the rear-view mirror

10:27.418 --> 10:29.500
and I'd see him just sitting there
grinning at me.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.290
I thought I could outrun him. Ha-ha-ha.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.718
You can't outrun the dark man.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.342
Not now. Millie

11:20.513 --> 11:22.549
put this on the board

11:38.406 --> 11:39.987
Come.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.367
- General starkey, sir.
- Close the door and drop the bull, len.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.994
Yes, sir.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.332
They killed them in a hurry down there.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.382
Telemetry suggests even the ones that
managed to get their respirators on

11:54.547 --> 11:56.412
died within 12 minutes.

11:56.591 --> 11:59.799
The rest of them were gone in five.
You believe that?

12:00.011 --> 12:02.172
Do I have a choice? No.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.720
Apparently, none of us do.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.683
It's nothing but a souped-up version
of the flu.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.720
Herbert denninger of the national
disease control center,

12:11.898 --> 12:15.311
the Pentagon's bright boy of the week,
says once we find campion,

12:15.526 --> 12:18.188
we'll know if it's actually gonna jump
to the outside.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.561
He says it'll probably mutate.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.739
But that's not gonna help
the people that catch it.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.569
General,
I have what might be something...

12:23.785 --> 12:26.276
It'll just take them longer to die,
that's all.

12:26.412 --> 12:30.075
Most people are gonna think
they've got the plain old non-lethal flu

12:30.250 --> 12:32.582
right up to the very end.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.038
And that's the biggest break
we've had so far.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.211
All because a gate malfunctioned

12:37.382 --> 12:41.466
and some glorified TV repairman
got his family and ran for the hills.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.464
I'd like to get that guy,
string him up by...

12:43.596 --> 12:45.076
Len: We found him.
We located campion.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.804
Crash-landed at a gas station

12:46.975 --> 12:49.887
on the outskirts of a one-stoplight town
in east Texas.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.352
He made it
halfway across the country?

12:53.523 --> 12:55.309
- How'd he do that?
- I don't know.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.358
But the important thing is, right now
we got a shot at containing this.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.189
- Is he dead or alive?
- He's dead.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.069
Oh, god. Denninger says

13:02.240 --> 13:04.606
this stuff has a communicability level
of over 99 percent.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.240
You understand what that means?

13:06.411 --> 13:08.618
Any chance we had of containing it
went by the boards

13:08.788 --> 13:11.029
when campion bought
his first takeout hamburger.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.287
Len:
We can't think that way, Billy.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.586
Yeah, you're right.
Of course you are.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.918
- What about the rest of his family?
- They're dead, sir.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.966
Contact with townspeople
was minimal

13:28.141 --> 13:29.301
starkey: That doesn't matter.

13:29.475 --> 13:33.343
We gotta shut that town down,
lock it up, dig a moat around it.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.933
That operation's already
on the launching pad, sir.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.685
What kind of coverage
you come up with?

13:38.776 --> 13:40.016
Anthrax.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.397
New strain.

13:43.406 --> 13:48.070
Ha-ha. Hey, that's a new one, all right.
It's real new.

13:48.244 --> 13:52.578
It's very good at its job too. Too good.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.872
Well, it's bad, general,
but it could be worse.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.124
Ha how's that?

14:01.758 --> 14:04.044
What's the name of this town?

14:05.178 --> 14:08.591
Arnette. Arnette, Texas.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.923
Man: All right, men, it's up.
Here you go.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.558
Announcer:
Cold got you down? Chills, fever?

14:21.736 --> 14:25.103
Sounds like you need a buddy.
Flu buddy.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.896
Fast-acting flu buddy.

14:27.075 --> 14:30.909
Available at pharmacies everywhere.
Flu buddy.

14:32.246 --> 14:35.033
Man. And now, let's get back
fo the I one star matinee movie

14:39.587 --> 14:43.580
state patrol, hap.
Looks like your cousin Joe-Bob.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.585
Hap: Hey, Joe-Bob.
Want me to fill her up for you?

14:49.764 --> 14:51.379
No, sir. I come by on other business.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.475
Was that old geezer here last night
when that guy took out your pumps?

14:55.937 --> 14:57.802
Vic? He's here
just about every night.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.228
Well, maybe he ought to
hear this too.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.731
Vic: Hear what?

15:02.110 --> 15:04.852
Joe-Bob: There's strangers
crawling all over braintree.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.561
Supposed to be
U.S. health service guys

15:06.739 --> 15:08.775
but they came
in a c-58 transport plane

15:08.950 --> 15:11.157
and they look like
regular army to me.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.576
And then there's been three more
big transport planes

15:13.788 --> 15:16.404
land over at starland in Arkansas
since noon.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.161
It was cholera. I knew it was.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.371
Joe-Bob: Well, I don't know
nothing about that.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.747
I'll tell you one thing, though.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.129
If the feds are thinking
about a quarantine,

15:25.216 --> 15:28.504
then you might have a little bit more
to worry about than cholera.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.845
I just thought you ought to know
what's stirring in the weeds, hap.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.177
If any of them other old boys
here last night come by,

15:35.309 --> 15:36.429
pass the word along to them.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.967
Just don't mention my name.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.099
You ought to take care of that,
old-timer.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.810
Them summer colds are the worst.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.825
What if it ain't a cold?

15:54.996 --> 15:57.908
What if I got whatever he had,
that guy last night?

15:58.082 --> 16:01.995
Oh, it's probably just the sniffles,
that's all

16:07.758 --> 16:10.921
Maybe I ought to close up the station
for the rest of the day.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.009
Call the other fellows,
see how they're feeling.

16:13.181 --> 16:15.638
Might not be a bad idea.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.064
Dang.

16:35.036 --> 16:37.743
Joe-Bob:
Uh, this is unit 16 to base.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.745
I'm seeing a lot of army traffic

16:39.957 --> 16:43.950
on, uh, state 17,
westbound in the direction of arnette.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.286
You heard anything about that? Bye.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.334
Please advise if you've been
anywhere near arnette today, bye.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.795
Uh, negative, base.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.261
I've been over
by the Arkansas state line all day.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.266
Cynthia:
Well, that's fine, then.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.956
Suggest you let the army
mind their business

17:02.980 --> 17:04.470
and you mind yours, unit 16.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.725
Bye.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.687
Well, you don't have to be
so grouchy about it, Cynthia.

17:09.487 --> 17:12.069
Unit 16 over and out.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.747
Soldier:
All right. Let's move it out.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.586
Boy 1: Get up there, get up.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.130
Come on, boy, force it.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.590
Rebound.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.415
Boy 2: Take a shot.
Boy 3: Right here.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.639
Boy 4: He's outside.
Boy 1: Shoot it!

17:45.606 --> 17:47.972
Boy 2: Damn.
Boy 5: We're sucking, you guys.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.163
Soldier 1:
Hold it right there, now.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.082
Soldier 2: Unload.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.631
Soldier 1:
Arms in front, we'll pull in from the left.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.879
Man 1:
What do you think you're doing here?

18:22.643 --> 18:23.974
Woman 1: Oh, don't hurt me.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.353
Woman 2: I can't leave my store.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.648
Man 2: Hey, what right have you got
to push me around?

18:35.698 --> 18:38.235
M.p.:
Stuart Richard redman, sir.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.400
He was at the station.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.528
Soldier:
People, let's go. Come on, now.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.371
Easy, there, easy.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.287
Sounds like
you're having a busy day.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.791
Denninger: Dr. Herbert denninger,
Mr. redman. Will you come with us?

18:56.969 --> 18:58.300
Hey.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.425
Wanna get your hand off my arm,
hoss?

19:02.183 --> 19:03.983
Denninger:
He had direct contact with campion.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.103
Put him in the back of the truck.
If he resists...

19:06.228 --> 19:07.593
I ain't gonna resist.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.643
Country don't mean dumb.

19:18.741 --> 19:22.108
I ain't going. I ain't, I ain't.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.197
Get you hands off of her.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.531
Denninger: Stay where you are,
Mr. redman. That's not your affair.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.123
Stu! What's happening?

19:34.340 --> 19:38.299
They want us to go...
They wanna take us to Vermont.

19:38.928 --> 19:42.136
Denninger: Mr. redman, I insist
you get into the truck right now or...

19:43.432 --> 19:44.763
What?

19:45.309 --> 19:47.049
Or you'll shoot me?

19:47.269 --> 19:49.260
That don't scare me much, hoss.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.764
If we got what that guy campion had,
we're dead already.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.266
Right?

20:23.389 --> 20:26.506
Well, our flying time today
will be three hours and 40 minutes

20:26.642 --> 20:29.054
and uncle Sam is buying all the drinks.

20:29.270 --> 20:32.728
What the hell's wrong with us?
Is it cholera?

20:32.940 --> 20:35.556
Absolutely not.
You'll be getting all the details.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.145
Stu: When?

20:37.319 --> 20:40.106
Shortly after you land.

20:48.622 --> 20:52.410
I ain't been this scared
since the mekong delta in '69.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.420
Well, that ain't true.
I've never been this scared.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.629
It's just the ones that was there
when campion croaked, ain't it?

21:02.803 --> 21:06.216
Us, our families,
people we've been around since.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.381
Right now, yeah.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.265
What do you mean, right now?

21:10.436 --> 21:14.145
Soldier: Okay, people, saddle up.
Let's go, let's go.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.768
You're on uncle Sam's time now.
Move it.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.729
Move them out.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.275
Arnette's been canceled.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.411
You serious?

21:28.579 --> 21:29.739
What do you think?

21:29.914 --> 21:31.745
I don't know.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.204
I think we're in big trouble.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.665
Dj:
And now, by request from bay Ridge,

21:41.759 --> 21:44.250
Larry Underwood and
"baby, can you dig your man?"

21:44.428 --> 21:46.965
Well, baby, can you?

22:52.788 --> 22:54.198
Ma?

23:01.714 --> 23:03.170
Ma

23:08.304 --> 23:09.760
Ma

23:10.598 --> 23:12.634
You look beautiful.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.175
Aren't you glad to see me?

23:16.604 --> 23:18.469
Should I be, Larry?

23:19.607 --> 23:22.519
Well, I can be happy
for the both of us.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.107
If I have to be.

23:32.786 --> 23:36.324
Come on inside, Larry,
before the neighbors get an eyeful.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.164
So you know the record
cracked the top 507?

23:44.340 --> 23:45.420
You heard it, right?

23:45.591 --> 23:48.128
Of course I have. You sound black

23:48.302 --> 23:51.920
well, that brown sound
sure do get around.

23:59.313 --> 24:00.723
Right.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.184
Sol'minl a.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.937
And all of a sudden,
everyone is my friend.

24:06.070 --> 24:08.231
I mean,
everyone's got a can't-miss deal.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.737
So I had to get out of there
for a little while, you know?

24:10.866 --> 24:12.402
Take a little time off.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.952
How's your back, ma?

24:18.374 --> 24:21.332
Pains me some, but I got my pills.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.124
What kind of trouble
are you in, Larry?

24:30.260 --> 24:31.750
Hm?

24:31.929 --> 24:32.964
Ding.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.256
Well, maybe I overspent my advance
7 little.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.393
I didn't know the record company
was gonna be so cheap.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.347
It's no big deal.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.858
Except I, uh...

24:48.278 --> 24:49.859
I borrowed a little money.

24:50.572 --> 24:53.314
Not from any bank
or you wouldn't be here, right?

25:00.582 --> 25:02.863
The leg breakers any different
out there on the west coast

25:02.960 --> 25:04.245
than they are here?

25:04.420 --> 25:08.083
Do they give you a Perrier and valium
before they start hurting you?

25:08.298 --> 25:09.788
You're just like your father.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.544
I am not just like pop.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.381
- You sound pissed off.
- Well, I am pissed off, ma.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.261
(00d.

25:16.765 --> 25:20.257
It's good to know that there's still
a real person in there someplace.

25:24.815 --> 25:26.430
How deep a hole are you in?

25:26.650 --> 25:28.641
And don't lie.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.935
I've seen your car.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.771
About 40,000.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.572
Jesus wept.

25:45.794 --> 25:50.709
But the record's number 21 this week,
ma, with a bullet. Bam.

25:51.592 --> 25:54.504
The album hasn't hit
the hot 100 yet, but it will.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.002
Forty thousand's nothing.

25:57.181 --> 25:59.172
Nothing.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.669
And I'm not gonna let them
make me a one-hit wonder either.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.766
Your son's here to stick around.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.053
I'm gonna be famous, ma.

26:06.231 --> 26:10.144
Even better, I'm gonna be rich.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.356
Rich

26:17.076 --> 26:19.408
the bed's still in your old room.

26:19.787 --> 26:20.947
I'll make it up.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.162
And I have to go to work.
I'm gonna be late as it is.

26:23.332 --> 26:26.244
All right. Thanks.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.123
Thanks, mom.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.091
Welcome home, Larry.

27:25.394 --> 27:28.261
Dietz: Ah. This is interesting.
Now, watch this.

27:53.255 --> 27:54.415
Dietz: Huh

27:54.590 --> 27:57.047
it's so damn quick.

27:57.467 --> 27:59.799
Uh, the only two left
from the gas station

27:59.970 --> 28:01.710
are bruett and redman, correct?

28:01.847 --> 28:04.429
Yes.
Bruett's critical and sinking fast,

28:04.600 --> 28:07.637
which leaves only redman,
who's not even sick.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.396
Dietz: Now, how in god's name
is that possible?

28:13.567 --> 28:17.151
Denninger:
I don't know. We're going to find out.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.936
We have to find out.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.194
And soon.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.821
We will

28:46.808 --> 28:47.911
Man: In other news,

28:47.935 --> 28:50.642
U.S. government health officials
claim there's nothing strange

28:50.729 --> 28:54.187
in their decision to quarantine
a small east Texas town,

28:54.274 --> 28:56.981
where a new strain
of what's believed to be swine flu

28:57.069 --> 28:59.105
has got half the population in bed

28:59.279 --> 29:01.611
and the other half
down with the sniffles.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.522
At the Vermont
center for disease control

29:03.659 --> 29:05.615
- hello, Mr. goldsmith.
- Hello, Harold.

29:05.786 --> 29:06.866
Is Fran around?

29:10.165 --> 29:13.248
Uh, she's in the kitchen, I think.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.632
Harold: Hi, Fran. - Hi, Harold.

29:22.803 --> 29:23.838
Thanks, daddy.

29:24.054 --> 29:25.965
Don't mention it, sweetheart.

29:27.975 --> 29:30.591
- I brought you something.
- Oh, you did?

29:30.769 --> 29:31.769
Ohh.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.011
Oh, is that you?

29:35.774 --> 29:38.481
Of course, everleaf
is just a small literary magazine.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.853
Small but prestigious.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.768
And they only pay
in contributors' copies.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.279
Look, daddy,
we know a published writer.

29:44.950 --> 29:48.033
How about that?

29:49.162 --> 29:51.949
Oh. My poem is called
"the crushed Rose"

29:52.082 --> 29:54.744
Fran: Uh-huh.
- I marked it for you.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.787
I actually sent in three.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.998
But, of course,
their space is very limited.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.959
Well, Harold, I'm gonna read this
just as soon as I get a chance.

30:02.092 --> 30:05.425
Thanks.
In the meantime, congratulations.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.636
Thank you.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.469
I had another reason
for stopping by as well.

30:11.643 --> 30:12.803
Oh?

30:13.312 --> 30:14.927
Yeah

30:15.439 --> 30:18.351
uh, I was wondering if you would
care to accompany me

30:18.525 --> 30:20.857
to the railroad cinema
this Friday in boothbay.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.980
- Oh...
- They're having a bergman festival.

30:23.071 --> 30:26.859
I've always found cries and whispers
to be especially moving.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.990
Well, you see,
Amy and I already decided

30:29.077 --> 30:31.284
to go to an r.E.M. Concert in Portland.

30:31.455 --> 30:34.538
So... sorry.

30:35.083 --> 30:38.621
Oh, well. Maybe some other time.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.290
Yeah

30:41.465 --> 30:44.798
Harold, I'm sure you'll find
somebody to go with.

30:44.968 --> 30:47.129
You know, maybe somebody
even your own age.

30:47.304 --> 30:50.762
I mean, I didn't mean that...

30:51.099 --> 30:52.589
- I really...
- Don't worry about it.

30:52.768 --> 30:55.180
It's okay. I understand, really.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.810
- I hope you enjoy the poem.
- I will

30:56.980 --> 30:58.561
and the rest of the magazine,
of course.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.814
Why don't you stay
and have iced tea or something?

31:01.026 --> 31:04.518
No, thanks.
I'm actually in sort of a hurry.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.822
Well, I really handled that great,
didn't I?

31:17.626 --> 31:20.117
Considering that Harold lauder's
had a crush on you

31:20.253 --> 31:21.618
since he was 9 years old,

31:21.797 --> 31:24.334
yeah, I think you did okay.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.207
Oh, let me see that.

31:30.764 --> 31:35.633
"I have stridden the fuming way
of sun-hammered tracks

31:35.852 --> 31:38.059
and savage hobo jungles”

31:38.230 --> 31:40.892
stop. Stop.

31:45.904 --> 31:49.317
Frannie, are you okay?

31:49.533 --> 31:51.148
Yeah

31:51.326 --> 31:53.738
I'm the object of a young poet's
unrequited love.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.243
What else could a girl want?

31:56.748 --> 32:00.411
You and Jess haven't had a fight”?

32:00.585 --> 32:02.917
I haven't seen much of him
this summer.

32:04.131 --> 32:08.420
Well, actually, Jess and I have decided
to spend some time apart.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.167
Oh.

32:11.096 --> 32:14.509
It's like that, is it?

32:15.225 --> 32:17.432
Yeah, just like that.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.260
Come here.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.930
Give your old man a hug.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.318
What about you?
How are you doing?

32:29.489 --> 32:31.400
Why, I'm fine. Fine.

32:32.409 --> 32:35.367
I woke up this morning
missing your mother,

32:35.537 --> 32:37.903
so I came out here.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.997
After seven years,

32:41.168 --> 32:44.035
there's a lot of places
in the house where she ain't.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.294
But this ain't one of them.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.498
Sometimes when I'm out here
yanking weeds,

32:49.593 --> 32:52.209
I can almost see her.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.720
I love you, daddy.

32:56.725 --> 32:59.011
I love you too.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.556
Although I've resigned myself

33:01.730 --> 33:03.266
to losing you
to Harold lauder someday.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.562
No

33:10.071 --> 33:11.231
You okay?

33:30.133 --> 33:32.670
Patty: And how are you today,
mr redman?

33:36.556 --> 33:39.389
- If I could have your arm.
- No, I won't be doing any more tests.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.720
Please, just your blood pressure.
Doctor's orders.

33:41.895 --> 33:45.262
No, I wanna talk to a doctor.
I wanna talk to a doctor in person.

33:45.482 --> 33:48.144
Well, I'm sure that you will be
talking to a doctor very soon.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.396
Yeah, I'm sure I will too.
No more tests!

33:51.112 --> 33:52.552
- I'm sick of it.
- Mr. redman, if...

33:52.697 --> 33:53.903
Hey!

33:56.034 --> 33:59.697
I think you better get in there.
Don't you?

34:31.403 --> 34:32.609
Stu: Well, say.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.581
If it isn't the man
with the little clipboard

34:34.739 --> 34:35.854
and the armed escort

34:39.786 --> 34:42.653
no, no, no, we don't
shake hands here. Just a precaution.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.489
A precaution? Uh-huh.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.375
Patty greer says you've given her
quite a bit of trouble.

34:49.462 --> 34:50.702
She's quite upset.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.541
Well, that makes two of us.

34:52.966 --> 34:55.082
Being hijacked by some
government sons of bitches

34:55.260 --> 34:57.967
in space suits
does that to me every time.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.379
If you don't wanna see
how quick I can rip a hole in that

35:00.557 --> 35:03.970
before you can get out of here,
you better give me a little information.

35:04.394 --> 35:05.884
You tell me why I'm not sick.

35:06.062 --> 35:09.600
- Mr. redman, I hardly think...
- Talk to me, damn it!

35:09.816 --> 35:11.272
I'm sorry, but you...

35:14.070 --> 35:16.061
Mr. redman, be reasonable.

35:16.573 --> 35:19.360
Just get out of here,
you little weasel.

35:20.869 --> 35:23.360
You send me someone
who can give me some answers.

35:23.538 --> 35:26.029
I don't think you quite appreciate
your position, Mr. redman.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.367
Stu: You're wrong about that.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.742
I do.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.664
(Go on, get out.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.240
Ray: Here he comes.

36:10.377 --> 36:12.377
Rick: We're not really gonna
hurt him, are we, ray?

36:12.545 --> 36:14.456
Ray: Quiet down, Rick.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.915
(Get him!

36:18.510 --> 36:20.967
What the hell are you waiting for?

36:23.807 --> 36:26.173
Next time I yell, friend,
you're gonna pay attention,

36:26.393 --> 36:28.224
I guarantee it. Unh!

36:28.395 --> 36:30.727
- Hold him, hold him. Hold the sucker.
Man: Ohh!

36:36.319 --> 36:37.809
Nick: Ooh!

36:38.905 --> 36:41.772
Hold him. I'm gonna mess him up.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.034
Rick: How come he don't
say nothing, ray?

36:48.581 --> 36:49.866
By the time I finish with him,

36:49.999 --> 36:51.959
he's gonna sing
"the battle hymn of the Republic."

36:52.127 --> 36:54.083
Sucker almost ruined my favorite shirt.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.910
I'm gonna mess him up.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.038
Stop it, ray. You're killing him.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.127
Ray, car.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.589
- No! Ray!
- Heads up, sucker.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.743
I can hear.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.739
I can talk.

38:15.585 --> 38:18.452
Woman: And he walks with me

38:18.588 --> 38:21.705
and he talks with me

38:21.883 --> 38:28.254
and he tells me I am his own

38:31.726 --> 38:33.557
Nick: I can hear.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.560
I can talk.

38:37.106 --> 38:39.017
I know, Nick.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.899
Praise god.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.318
How did you know my name?

38:44.823 --> 38:47.610
Come to me in a dream, I reckon.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.573
Is this a dream?

38:50.370 --> 38:54.409
Well, mayhap it is, and mayhap it ain't.
Heh-heh-heh

38:57.794 --> 38:59.000
who are you, ma'am?

39:00.880 --> 39:03.747
Abagall freemantle.

39:03.925 --> 39:08.544
But folks around these parts
just call me mother abagail.

39:09.514 --> 39:14.178
I'm 106 years old
and I still make my own bread.

39:15.395 --> 39:16.760
I've been living right here

39:16.896 --> 39:20.263
in hemingford home, Nebraska
all my life.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.184
You come see me, Nick.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.570
You and all your friends.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.947
You got to hurry, though.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.574
There's a storm coming.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.375
His storm.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.597
Woman:
Some people have even taken

40:19.751 --> 40:21.241
fo wearing protection on the streets.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.819
Why are you wearing this mask, sir?

40:22.962 --> 40:24.543
Man:
I don't know. Just to feel safer.

40:24.714 --> 40:25.714
Woman: Okay. Thank you.

40:25.882 --> 40:28.589
Katie, the folks at the Atlanta
disease control center told me

40:28.760 --> 40:32.048
that these masks wouldn't stop
a flu germ with a hangover.

40:32.221 --> 40:33.221
Gin.

40:33.348 --> 40:34.909
Woman: I guess we can thank
our lucky stars

40:34.933 --> 40:37.214
that this outbreak of superfiu
is just another of those...

40:37.977 --> 40:40.164
Soames: I don't know about all
those people down in Texas,

40:40.188 --> 40:43.931
but you sure sound like you got
a dose of the flu, Johnny.

40:44.108 --> 40:47.020
- You better let me take a listen.
- Forget that.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.151
Oh, come on.

40:49.322 --> 40:51.904
You know how hot it makes me
when you take your shirt off.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.902
Shoot.

41:03.544 --> 41:04.544
When I was a boy,

41:04.712 --> 41:08.000
we caught ourselves a mountain lion
back up in the hills.

41:08.174 --> 41:10.756
We shot it
and dragged it back to town.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.759
What was left of that critter
when we got home

41:13.930 --> 41:16.717
was the sorriest-looking sight
I've ever seen.

41:17.767 --> 41:19.723
You're the second sorriest, boy.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.686
I'm gonna get somebody
to take his shirt off

41:23.815 --> 41:26.522
before I go home tonight.

41:28.027 --> 41:31.269
It's okay, son. I'm a doctor.

41:32.782 --> 41:36.491
I'm also the guy
that damn near ran you over.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.985
You got a name, babalugah?

41:45.920 --> 41:47.501
What the hell?

41:54.512 --> 41:56.377
It means that he's deaf and dumb.

41:58.725 --> 42:01.387
Yeah? That hurt?

42:01.936 --> 42:03.346
Okay.

42:03.896 --> 42:04.896
If you're deaf and dumb,

42:05.023 --> 42:08.561
how the hell am I gonna find out
what happened to you tonight?

42:30.298 --> 42:32.254
Can you read lips, babalugah?

42:33.760 --> 42:36.422
Well, thank god for small favors.

42:36.637 --> 42:38.002
Now you tell me this:

42:38.181 --> 42:41.389
Would you know the three boys that
jobbed you if you seen them again?

42:44.145 --> 42:45.726
What?

42:48.357 --> 42:50.598
One of them had a ring like that”?

42:50.777 --> 42:52.608
Soames: Uh-oh. - Oh, man.

42:52.779 --> 42:55.316
That's a fraternity ring, my silent friend.

42:55.490 --> 42:58.823
And the only two people around here
who have them

42:58.993 --> 43:04.078
are our esteemed sheriff
and ray booth, our town bad boy.

43:04.248 --> 43:08.116
The sheriff here
married Ray's baby sister.

43:08.628 --> 43:11.210
Janey's gonna just love this.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.792
Soames:
Welcome to shoyo, Mr. andros.

43:17.887 --> 43:21.175
It's a veritable hotbed
of Southern hospitality.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.214
Get away from me.

43:39.117 --> 43:41.574
I don't know how many different ways
I can say this.

43:41.661 --> 43:45.404
This so-called superflu does not exist.

43:47.125 --> 43:49.912
Reporter: Then what is it?
Why is everybody talking about it?

43:50.044 --> 43:52.106
Starkey: I don't know why
everybody's talking about it.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.961
I don't know where
the rumors are coming from.

43:54.132 --> 43:55.997
It must be a figment
of the press' imagination.

43:56.175 --> 43:58.336
I don't know why I'm up here
answering these questions.

43:58.511 --> 44:01.719
I don't have the answers.
Because there's no such thing...

44:04.016 --> 44:07.349
Good afternoon, Mr. redman.
My name is dietz.

44:07.520 --> 44:10.262
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

44:14.318 --> 44:17.230
Meet Geraldo.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.733
- Geraldo, huh?
- Mm-hm_

44:20.158 --> 44:22.945
Now, the virus
your fellow townspeople contracted

44:23.119 --> 44:25.781
passes easily from human
to Guinea pig

44:25.872 --> 44:27.328
and vice versa, presumably.

44:27.915 --> 44:31.578
But Geraldo has been breathing
your air via convector

44:31.752 --> 44:33.743
for the last three days.

44:33.921 --> 44:37.334
And Geraldo is fine and frisky,

44:37.550 --> 44:39.290
ds you see.

44:40.219 --> 44:42.585
I'd call that rather comforting,
wouldn't you?

44:43.806 --> 44:45.762
I see you're not taking any chances.

44:45.933 --> 44:48.390
That's not in my contract.

44:48.561 --> 44:49.926
However, it does appear

44:50.104 --> 44:53.688
that there is absolutely nothing wrong
with you, Mr. redman.

44:53.816 --> 44:56.728
Or may I call you stu?

44:56.903 --> 44:59.485
Just don't call me Geraldo.

45:00.198 --> 45:02.735
I like that.

45:02.950 --> 45:05.191
Now look here, stu,

45:05.369 --> 45:08.156
let's try to get through this
as painlessly as possible.

45:08.331 --> 45:09.411
What do you say?

45:12.251 --> 45:13.741
Okay.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.205
Here's number one.

45:16.547 --> 45:19.505
The testing schedule
we began earlier this week

45:19.634 --> 45:25.220
is going to resume,
with your cooperation or without it.

45:25.389 --> 45:27.175
We got a hell of a mess
on our hands here

45:27.350 --> 45:28.760
thanks to that imbecile, campion.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.934
So I don't want you
to get the idea you're a volunteer.

45:32.063 --> 45:33.394
You've been drafted.

45:39.570 --> 45:41.561
What about the folks I came in with?

45:41.739 --> 45:44.481
From arnette? All dead

45:44.700 --> 45:46.315
which is why we can't afford...

45:47.620 --> 45:50.908
What did you do?
What did you people do?

45:51.040 --> 45:53.406
Stu, please...

45:56.337 --> 45:59.500
No! Stand clear!

46:17.400 --> 46:20.392
All right, now you listen up.

46:20.987 --> 46:24.479
I'm not responsible for you being here

46:24.615 --> 46:27.402
or for the dead people
in your home town.

46:27.576 --> 46:30.033
Neither is denninger or the nurses

46:30.204 --> 46:31.819
who come in
to take your blood pressure.

46:32.039 --> 46:36.829
- Then who is?
- No one, everyone, god.

46:37.003 --> 46:38.083
Who knows?

46:38.254 --> 46:41.746
All you have to do is resign yourself
to a few more pokes and pricks.

46:43.217 --> 46:45.378
Well, what if I... 7?

46:50.182 --> 46:53.925
- Evacuate!
- Dietz, calm down.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.221
I was just faking.

47:01.902 --> 47:03.517
Dietz. Why?

47:04.405 --> 47:06.270
Why would you do a thing like that?

47:08.242 --> 47:13.077
You talk about this thing in here
like you were outside of it.

47:13.706 --> 47:16.743
I just wanted you to get a little taste
of what it's like on the inside.

47:16.917 --> 47:18.748
How did you like it?

47:21.172 --> 47:24.209
You stupid son of a bitch.

47:28.137 --> 47:29.502
(Set the hell out of here.

47:35.061 --> 47:37.552
Don't forget your damn Guinea pig.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.625
Man: Reports of
the supposedly lethal flu epidemic

48:05.800 --> 48:06.835
continue to spread.

48:07.009 --> 48:09.375
Many downtown shopping areas
in Southern Florida

48:09.470 --> 48:11.927
are virtually empty this morning
and the flu rumor

48:12.056 --> 48:13.887
actually seems to be
gaining credence

48:13.974 --> 48:17.182
despite statements from health
officials in Atlanta and Vermont

48:17.269 --> 48:19.601
in Vermont,
Dr. Herbert denninger said, quote,

48:19.772 --> 48:24.516
"let me put it in five simple words.
Captain trips does not exist.”

48:24.652 --> 48:26.768
How's the sexiest bartenderin L.A. 7

48:26.946 --> 48:28.426
Arlene: Larry, is that you?

48:28.614 --> 48:31.822
Larry: Yeah, Arlene, listen...
- You better get this first.

48:31.992 --> 48:32.992
Wayne stukey called.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.697
He said your album's going up
nine spots this week.

48:35.788 --> 48:37.708
Your single's number three
on the billboard chart

48:37.790 --> 48:39.781
and you're number one on vh1!

48:40.000 --> 48:42.412
Sounds to me like you might just be
king of the world.

48:42.628 --> 48:44.619
What's it sound like to you?

48:44.797 --> 48:47.413
Victory! Ha-hal

48:47.967 --> 48:51.755
- Arlene, I love you.
- Oh, don't I wish!

48:51.929 --> 48:55.342
Listen, I'm gonna try
and get the afternoon flight back.

48:55.516 --> 48:59.850
So you put on your sexiest number
and I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

49:00.020 --> 49:03.763
Then I'll take you out dancing.
Then maybe I'll just take you.

49:04.733 --> 49:07.315
You might want to consider
delaying your trip back a few days.

49:07.778 --> 49:10.019
- Why, what's the problem?
- Things are weird.

49:10.239 --> 49:13.026
People are really scared
about this captain trips thing.

49:15.494 --> 49:18.611
Well, the radio out here says the
hospitals are filling up with sick people

49:18.789 --> 49:20.029
and some of them are dying.

49:20.166 --> 49:23.624
- What, people are dying of the flu?
- There's a lot of soldiers around.

49:23.836 --> 49:26.703
Suddenly, L.A.'s
a really creepy place to be, Larry.

49:27.715 --> 49:30.172
Maybe I'll stick around New York
a couple of days then.

49:30.342 --> 49:32.942
Yeah. Well, just don't forget what
you promised when you get back.

49:33.262 --> 49:36.754
Dinner, dancing
and all the paparazzi I can smile at.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.839
Yeah, yeah, you got it.

49:39.018 --> 49:41.009
Sea ae = £2

49:48.819 --> 49:50.559
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, man.

49:50.738 --> 49:54.981
The rat man forgive you, this time.

50:05.419 --> 50:07.705
Monster shouter:
Bring out your dead!

50:07.838 --> 50:10.329
Bring out your dead!

50:11.050 --> 50:15.714
Bring out your dead!
Bring out your dead!

50:16.013 --> 50:19.130
Bring out your...!
He's coming for you, Larry!

50:20.643 --> 50:22.850
The man with no face.

50:24.813 --> 50:27.270
Bring out your dead!

50:28.275 --> 50:30.937
Bring out your dead!

50:46.794 --> 50:48.375
Turn that up!

50:52.591 --> 50:54.923
- Give me that!
- It's a dead soldier.

50:57.346 --> 50:59.302
Dead company. Ha-ha-ha!

50:59.765 --> 51:01.801
Poke: Whoa! Whoa!

51:01.976 --> 51:04.843
- All-star bowling!
Lloyd: Come on, poke.

51:05.062 --> 51:08.099
Well, you know what time it is?
“What time is it?

51:08.274 --> 51:10.194
- Time to make a cash withdrawal!
- I heard that.

51:10.359 --> 51:11.359
And if anybody,

51:11.527 --> 51:15.236
I mean anybody, says anything
or does anything to stop us...

51:16.240 --> 51:19.403
- We gonna pokerize them.
- That's right, damn straight!

51:23.998 --> 51:25.283
Poke: I ook around.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.576
I ook around.

51:32.923 --> 51:34.563
Lloyd:
If we're gonna do this, do it fast.

51:34.717 --> 51:36.582
I know what you mean, jellybean.

51:42.057 --> 51:43.342
All right!

51:44.393 --> 51:46.429
Hold still and won't nobody get hurt!

51:46.979 --> 51:49.391
Heh-heh-heh. That's all, folks.

51:50.190 --> 51:51.305
Look out, poke!

52:00.034 --> 52:04.448
Did you see it, Lloyd?
That old bugger tried to shoot me.

52:05.372 --> 52:06.407
Lloyd!

52:19.053 --> 52:21.214
Deputy 1: Hold it, hold it!

52:21.430 --> 52:22.545
Hold it. Hands up.

52:23.015 --> 52:26.428
Kingsolving: Deputy sheriff Owen
kingsolving, officers, coming out.

52:29.438 --> 52:32.930
Who's he? What's he doing there?

52:37.363 --> 52:38.853
You got this coming out the door.

52:40.366 --> 52:41.366
Deputy 2: That's enough!

52:41.575 --> 52:43.941
- That's enough, Owen!
- Bullcrap!

52:45.954 --> 52:47.785
Kingsolving: Pop Jones,

52:47.956 --> 52:50.914
Betty diamond, both dead.

52:52.336 --> 52:54.543
Kingsolving:
It ain't never gonna be enough.

53:03.263 --> 53:05.800
Man: No, we will not do that.

53:14.066 --> 53:17.103
Len: We have a rather large problem
in Wyoming, sir.

53:17.319 --> 53:19.605
What large problem is that, len?

53:19.780 --> 53:21.736
News team got out of pine bluff

53:21.865 --> 53:24.322
with some
potentially damaging videotape, sir.

53:24.576 --> 53:27.409
Flu victims? Body dumps?

53:27.579 --> 53:29.035
Len: A little of both.

53:29.248 --> 53:32.456
- And our ops, I'm told.
- Oh, well, we can't have that.

53:32.543 --> 53:33.407
Len: No. Sir. I know.

53:33.502 --> 53:36.710
Showing footage like that
would not be in the national interest.

53:36.839 --> 53:38.795
Absolutely not, sir.

53:39.299 --> 53:41.381
Well, do we know
where these news people,

53:41.552 --> 53:43.417
these rabble-rousers are now?

53:44.763 --> 53:46.594
Yes, sir. We do.

53:46.932 --> 53:48.422
Get that videotape, len.

53:49.101 --> 53:53.435
Any means necessary.
Make it a priority.

53:53.647 --> 53:55.353
Yes, sir.

53:57.860 --> 54:00.067
Any means necessary.

54:18.839 --> 54:21.296
- Everybody, out of the Van.
- Mike, are you getting all this?

54:21.425 --> 54:23.131
I don't like how this looks be careful

54:23.302 --> 54:25.543
major:
Come on! Out right now, let's go!

54:25.721 --> 54:26.927
You're gonna have to surrender

54:27.097 --> 54:28.712
the video camera
that gentleman's holding

54:28.849 --> 54:30.430
and any videotape
you have already shot.

54:30.601 --> 54:31.681
Can you tell us why, major?

54:32.978 --> 54:35.139
You don't seem to understand
the situation here, ma'am.

54:35.314 --> 54:36.599
Martial law has been declared.

54:36.774 --> 54:39.311
We don't have to put up with you
and your pinko friends anymore.

54:39.443 --> 54:41.354
Mike, are you getting all this?

54:41.528 --> 54:43.769
- Get him, get him!
- Now, can we have a comment...?

54:43.947 --> 54:45.341
Major:
Get the camera, get the driver!

54:45.365 --> 54:46.365
Reporter: Mike, no!

54:48.035 --> 54:50.868
Major: Put her in the car, in the car!
Reporter: No!

54:51.038 --> 54:52.838
Soldier 1: Cut the power.
Soldier 2: I said...

55:01.423 --> 55:02.754
Come.

55:07.054 --> 55:08.590
Thank you.

55:13.769 --> 55:17.557
Looks like our problem in Wyoming
has been solved.

55:18.273 --> 55:22.733
That doesn't change the basic fact
that our goose is pretty well cooked.

55:24.029 --> 55:26.441
Things fall apart

55:26.615 --> 55:29.106
the center does not hold

55:31.537 --> 55:34.620
a man named yeats said that.

55:36.250 --> 55:39.538
I didn't understand
that poem in college, len.

55:40.796 --> 55:44.414
But I must be getting smarter
in my old age

55:44.591 --> 55:46.923
because I understand it now.

55:47.845 --> 55:50.803
And one other line from that poem:

55:52.432 --> 55:58.723
What rough beast,
its hour come around at last,

55:59.648 --> 56:03.982
slouches toward Bethlehem
to be born?

56:06.238 --> 56:08.320
I think that beast
might be on his way, len.

56:11.827 --> 56:13.442
What do you think?

56:17.332 --> 56:20.290
Is that Hungarian goulash?

56:22.963 --> 56:25.045
It might be, sir.

56:25.632 --> 56:30.001
Yeats was right. Things fall apart.

56:47.404 --> 56:51.272
Ray:
Hey! Who died and made you god?

56:52.200 --> 56:54.361
You don't think we're gonna eat that,
do you, dummy?

56:54.578 --> 56:55.943
You could have poisoned it.

56:56.121 --> 57:00.080
You blue-eyed pretty boy. I'm gonna
mess up your hair, pretty boy!

57:00.292 --> 57:02.157
I'm gonna ride you like a lame bronc.

57:02.252 --> 57:04.288
You're mine, sucker!

57:06.590 --> 57:09.832
Sorry, guy, I can't. I'm sick.

57:11.678 --> 57:13.589
Ray:
We're not gonna eat it, dummy.

57:13.764 --> 57:17.256
None of us! We're on a hunger strike.

57:18.268 --> 57:20.600
I'm awful hungry, ray.

57:21.605 --> 57:22.605
You son of a.

58:03.438 --> 58:05.645
Hey, dummy! Wanna drink?

58:06.942 --> 58:11.436
Hunger strike! I am on a hunger strike
until you let me out of here!

58:11.780 --> 58:15.773
Now, you come on over here,
because I'm not done with you yet.

58:22.249 --> 58:24.956
Soames: Has there been much
of that foolishness?

58:46.023 --> 58:48.389
Sorry, John and his wife are dead.

58:49.151 --> 58:54.271
A lot of people in shoyo are dead.
And a lot more are gonna die.

58:54.448 --> 58:56.234
In fact, you and I

58:56.324 --> 58:59.441
may be the last two healthy people
in western Arkansas.

58:59.619 --> 59:01.259
- What's he talking about, ray?
- Shut up!

59:01.371 --> 59:03.407
Soames: Our government
is still denying everything.

59:04.124 --> 59:06.581
But the radio says
the hospitals are filling up

59:06.752 --> 59:13.089
and the army's burning bodies
in waste treatment facilities. Ha-ha.

59:14.342 --> 59:18.085
It's the ultimate recycling program.

59:28.190 --> 59:29.555
Doc.

59:29.733 --> 59:32.395
Hey, doc, you gotta let me out of here!
They're both sick.

59:32.611 --> 59:36.524
Keeping me in here with them
is cruel and unusual punishment.

59:37.115 --> 59:41.074
I got a little cabin up in the hills.
And I'm gonna try to wait this out.

59:41.244 --> 59:43.030
And so I was...

59:45.457 --> 59:48.620
All right.
My responsibility as a doctor.

59:48.794 --> 59:50.159
Hey, don't make me laugh.

59:50.337 --> 59:55.252
I took an oath to treat my patients,
not die with them.

59:58.887 --> 1:00:01.629
You could come with me
if you want, Nick.

1:00:09.106 --> 1:00:12.974
Joe got sick
and made you responsible for them?

1:00:13.151 --> 1:00:14.151
Yeah

1:00:14.319 --> 1:00:17.356
but that doesn't mean that you
can't let them out now that he's gone.

1:00:17.531 --> 1:00:21.649
Hey, ray, if he lets you out,
are you gonna mess with him?

1:00:22.244 --> 1:00:25.077
No. I swear.

1:00:25.247 --> 1:00:26.282
Man: Me neither!

1:00:28.750 --> 1:00:30.661
They'll leave you alone.

1:01:36.568 --> 1:01:38.934
I got something for you, mutie.

1:01:39.112 --> 1:01:41.194
Been saving it up, you might say.

1:01:48.872 --> 1:01:50.988
Oohh.

1:01:56.004 --> 1:01:59.838
Soames: Things have changed, ray.
You might do well to remember that.

1:02:09.142 --> 1:02:11.679
Ray:
You might see me again, mutie.

1:02:27.577 --> 1:02:32.241
So, what do you say?
Wanna come up country with me?

1:02:36.336 --> 1:02:38.292
God, you're nuts.

1:02:38.463 --> 1:02:40.454
He's as good as dead.

1:03:03.113 --> 1:03:07.026
Water, please. Thirsty.

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:45.548
Man: Although city
and government spokespersons

1:03:45.572 --> 1:03:48.985
vehemently deny it, reliable sources
continue to report to news radio

1:03:49.075 --> 1:03:52.033
that troops opened fire earlier today
on unarmed pedestrians

1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:54.452
attempting to flee New York
by way of the Lincoln tunnel.

1:03:54.539 --> 1:03:56.404
As many as 60 persons
may have been killed

1:03:56.499 --> 1:03:57.659
with hundreds wounded.

1:03:57.751 --> 1:04:00.333
Although travel to some
of the outer boroughs is still possible,

1:04:00.462 --> 1:04:03.954
news radio advises you
to stay off the streets.

1:04:21.775 --> 1:04:23.185
Mom?

1:04:23.401 --> 1:04:25.437
Alice: I'm so hot.

1:04:25.612 --> 1:04:27.728
You're gonna be fine, mom.
Let's just put you to bed.

1:04:27.864 --> 1:04:31.698
Larry, go find your father.
He's in the bar.

1:04:31.826 --> 1:04:34.238
He's in the bar
with that photographer.

1:04:34.412 --> 1:04:36.198
Larry: Okay, ma.

1:05:09.781 --> 1:05:11.066
Take a little sip of this.

1:05:11.282 --> 1:05:13.068
Come on. Pick your head up.

1:05:13.243 --> 1:05:15.404
Just take a little bit,
you swallow it down.

1:05:15.495 --> 1:05:18.987
Okay, there you go. There you go.

1:05:40.854 --> 1:05:46.065
Larry, watch out for him. The dark man

1:05:46.734 --> 1:05:49.100
coming for youl.

1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:52.316
What did you say, ma?

1:06:01.124 --> 1:06:02.580
Ma

1:06:31.321 --> 1:06:34.859
God...!
How can a hospital phone be busy?

1:06:35.074 --> 1:06:37.110
Larry!

1:06:39.037 --> 1:06:42.746
Ma, just get back here. Sit back.

1:06:42.916 --> 1:06:46.534
Okay. Sit back.

1:06:47.921 --> 1:06:52.540
You're gonna be fine, ma.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:06:52.717 --> 1:06:57.211
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be fine.

1:07:18.952 --> 1:07:20.943
Monster shouter:
Bring out your dead!

1:07:21.120 --> 1:07:22.610
Bring out your dead!

1:07:22.789 --> 1:07:26.907
He's coming! Bring out your dead!

1:08:20.805 --> 1:08:22.170
Toa ey == == sas == os eas a eas

1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:30.728
Oh, god. No!

1:08:37.864 --> 1:08:39.820
You're right, Billy.

1:08:42.744 --> 1:08:45.281
The center doesn't hold.

1:08:47.832 --> 1:08:49.447
Sure doesn't.

1:09:38.174 --> 1:09:40.415
How's it going, mutie?

1:09:40.593 --> 1:09:41.878
What's shaking?

1:09:49.435 --> 1:09:53.644
You're gonna be in hell for 30 seconds
before you even know you're dead.

1:10:00.863 --> 1:10:02.945
Ray: None of this happened
till you came along.

1:10:03.157 --> 1:10:04.693
I'm gonna kill you, mutie!

1:10:10.540 --> 1:10:12.076
You.

1:10:25.930 --> 1:10:28.296
Bring out your dead!

1:10:28.433 --> 1:10:31.300
The monster's coming!
He's coming!

1:10:31.436 --> 1:10:36.430
Bring out your dead!
Bring out your dead!

1:10:36.607 --> 1:10:40.850
The monster's coming!
Bring out your dead!

1:10:40.987 --> 1:10:42.602
The monster.

1:10:54.459 --> 1:10:56.791
Fran: Here you go, dad.

1:10:56.961 --> 1:11:00.624
Here's some toast
and some Jewish penicillin for you.

1:11:00.798 --> 1:11:02.629
Chicken soup,
to the great unwashed.

1:11:02.842 --> 1:11:05.003
Oh, that looks good, darling.

1:11:05.178 --> 1:11:07.214
How you feeling?

1:11:07.722 --> 1:11:09.804
Better. Quite a bit.

1:11:09.974 --> 1:11:11.965
I think I might be beating it.

1:11:12.143 --> 1:11:15.135
Well, that's good, because
I still can't reach Dr. albertson.

1:11:15.271 --> 1:11:17.711
And the rent-a-doc in Wells
is still not picking up the phone.

1:11:17.815 --> 1:11:19.430
I just keep getting a recording.

1:11:19.567 --> 1:11:22.274
You know, this flu is everywhere.
It's really scary.

1:11:22.445 --> 1:11:25.778
- Oh, you look okay.
- Well, I feel okay.

1:11:26.115 --> 1:11:27.980
Great in fact. Yeah?

1:11:29.952 --> 1:11:32.443
Well, hey, turn on the radio, will you?

1:11:32.747 --> 1:11:36.535
- It's time for rae flowers.
- Oh, not that sarcastic little woman.

1:11:36.793 --> 1:11:38.875
Well, I like her.

1:11:39.170 --> 1:11:40.785
Okay.

1:11:45.176 --> 1:11:48.293
Flowers: Hello, there. This is
rae flowers on speak your piece.

1:11:48.387 --> 1:11:51.595
And I guess this morning
there's only one topic of conversation.

1:11:51.766 --> 1:11:53.222
You can call it the superflu

1:11:53.392 --> 1:11:55.724
or by its west coast name,
captain trips,

1:11:55.853 --> 1:11:57.764
but it means the same thing
either way.

1:11:57.939 --> 1:11:59.270
There've been some horror stories

1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:01.601
about the army
clamping down on everything.

1:12:01.776 --> 1:12:04.233
Fran: The army?
Flowers: Just be patient with me.

1:12:04.362 --> 1:12:06.273
Remember I'm running this show
all by myself.

1:12:06.405 --> 1:12:08.691
Everyone else called in sick.

1:12:08.908 --> 1:12:12.742
The numbers are the same though,
555-talk and 555-chat

1:12:12.912 --> 1:12:13.992
so let's go.

1:12:14.205 --> 1:12:17.618
Hello, there. This is rae flowers
and it's time to speak your piece.

1:12:17.708 --> 1:12:19.708
Woman:
I'm calling from Portsmouth, rae.

1:12:19.836 --> 1:12:21.121
What's your name, Portsmouth?

1:12:21.295 --> 1:12:22.330
I eonora.

1:12:23.130 --> 1:12:25.212
Listen, rae,
I just want everyone to know

1:12:25.383 --> 1:12:28.716
that there are soldiers burning bodies
across the state line, in kittery.

1:12:28.845 --> 1:12:32.212
Also, my little girl died this morning.

1:12:32.598 --> 1:12:35.089
I guess she's with Jesus now.

1:12:36.352 --> 1:12:38.388
Flowers:
I'm sorry as hell, leonora.

1:12:38.563 --> 1:12:40.303
Leonora:
Rae, I think the soldiers did it.

1:12:40.523 --> 1:12:43.265
I think they made a bug
that's, like, killing people.

1:12:43.401 --> 1:12:45.813
That wouldn't be very American,
now, would it?

1:12:45.987 --> 1:12:47.397
Leonora: No. I guess not.

1:12:47.572 --> 1:12:50.132
Of course, it's never stopped
the real patriots among us, has it?

1:12:50.199 --> 1:12:52.815
- You try to hang in there, leonora.
- I'm trying, rae.

1:12:52.994 --> 1:12:56.532
But have you ever smelled
bodies on fire?

1:12:57.957 --> 1:13:01.370
Flowers: I can't say that I have.
Leonora: It's awful, rae, it's just...

1:13:02.336 --> 1:13:03.792
You just try to hang in there, hon.

1:13:04.505 --> 1:13:07.747
This is rae flowers. You're on the air.
And it's time to speak your piece.

1:13:09.552 --> 1:13:11.668
I just wanna tell you
that I love your show, rae.

1:13:20.521 --> 1:13:23.934
You say you saw these gls
gunning down unarmed civilians?

1:13:27.945 --> 1:13:30.226
Soldier: Open in the name
of the United States government!

1:13:31.324 --> 1:13:32.324
Tell you what, Portland,

1:13:32.491 --> 1:13:34.491
the marines have landed,
and they don't look happy.

1:13:34.619 --> 1:13:37.907
This is a joke, right?
I mean, this has gotta be a joke.

1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:40.412
I don't think so, frannie.
I really don't think so.

1:13:40.583 --> 1:13:42.063
Flowers:
Hi, there. You're on the air.

1:13:42.126 --> 1:13:43.326
Man 2: Rae, are you all right?

1:13:43.419 --> 1:13:46.148
Flowers: To tell you the truth,
doesn't look good for the kid right now.

1:13:46.172 --> 1:13:48.788
Several soldiers
have just broken into the studio.

1:13:48.966 --> 1:13:52.550
They're fully armed and dressed
in some kind of protective clothing.

1:13:52.762 --> 1:13:54.969
They're wearing respirators
oh their faces.

1:13:56.641 --> 1:13:58.632
Soldier: Shut it down!
- Hey, bluto!

1:13:58.809 --> 1:14:00.849
You ever heard of a number
called freedom of speech?

1:14:00.978 --> 1:14:03.720
Bill of rights? Any of that ring a bell?

1:14:03.898 --> 1:14:07.732
Folks, I've just been ordered by my
uninvited fascist guests to shut down.

1:14:08.152 --> 1:14:10.734
- And I've refused, I think...
Soldier: All right, that's enough.

1:14:13.157 --> 1:14:15.739
Oh, my god! What's happening?

1:14:15.910 --> 1:14:17.525
Daddy, what's happening?

1:14:19.163 --> 1:14:21.279
I don't know, honey.

1:14:21.916 --> 1:14:23.998
I don't know.

1:14:26.379 --> 1:14:30.292
Monster shouter:
He's closer now! The hardcase!

1:14:31.092 --> 1:14:34.255
The dark man! He's coming!

1:14:34.428 --> 1:14:38.637
He's closer now! The dark man!

1:15:09.422 --> 1:15:11.583
Flagg: Rub-a-dub-dub.

1:15:17.722 --> 1:15:19.758
Thanks for the grub.

1:15:32.069 --> 1:15:34.310
Monster shouter:
He's here! He's here!

1:15:35.197 --> 1:15:38.360
The monster's here!
The dark man's here!

1:16:29.585 --> 1:16:32.167
Abagail:
Hello there, east Texas.

1:16:32.713 --> 1:16:36.922
- What kept you?
- I was lost in the corn.

1:16:38.427 --> 1:16:40.793
Then I heard the guitar.

1:16:41.847 --> 1:16:43.337
It sounds so sweet

1:16:45.226 --> 1:16:49.219
I ain't been able to make
a decent f chord in 20 years.

1:16:49.772 --> 1:16:52.013
But thank you kindly.

1:16:55.736 --> 1:16:57.317
Who are you?

1:16:57.488 --> 1:16:58.944
Where is this?

1:16:59.115 --> 1:17:04.735
I'm abagail freemantle.
And this is hemingford home.

1:17:05.621 --> 1:17:10.991
Stuart, those folks who got you
won't leave you to live much longer.

1:17:11.210 --> 1:17:12.916
You know that, don't you?

1:17:13.379 --> 1:17:15.711
I reckon maybe I do.

1:17:17.133 --> 1:17:21.001
The beast is loose
in the streets of Bethlehem.

1:17:21.178 --> 1:17:23.089
The rats are in the corn.

1:17:23.305 --> 1:17:25.591
I don't follow you, ma'am.

1:17:31.147 --> 1:17:32.182
Ma'am?

1:17:34.608 --> 1:17:38.601
Ma'am? Ma'am? Where are you?

1:17:39.155 --> 1:17:40.941
Abagail:
Folks around these parts

1:17:41.115 --> 1:17:44.278
just call me mother abagall,
east Texas.

1:17:44.410 --> 1:17:46.196
Stu: Mother abagail?

1:18:53.771 --> 1:18:58.014
Dietz:
Well, how we feeling, stu?

1:18:59.109 --> 1:19:02.442
Stu: Fine. - Fine.

1:19:03.405 --> 1:19:05.191
Always fine.

1:19:07.284 --> 1:19:08.569
Dietz: Now, just think.

1:19:08.744 --> 1:19:11.406
All the tests we ran on you

1:19:11.580 --> 1:19:16.165
and we never found
a single immunity factor, not one.

1:19:17.711 --> 1:19:22.580
Now, I'm curious.
How would you explain it, stu?

1:19:22.758 --> 1:19:25.750
Have you been touched by god?

1:19:30.432 --> 1:19:31.467
Hmm?

1:19:37.231 --> 1:19:39.563
What you got behind your back?

1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:45.315
Ah-ah!

1:19:49.159 --> 1:19:50.159
Stu: I see

1:19:50.327 --> 1:19:52.363
- do you?
- I think I do, yeah.

1:19:52.538 --> 1:19:54.779
I wonder.

1:19:57.626 --> 1:20:00.493
Where's your buddy, denninger?
Huh?

1:20:01.338 --> 1:20:03.294
He's dead.

1:20:04.591 --> 1:20:06.627
They're all dead.

1:20:08.095 --> 1:20:12.384
Everyone except for me and thee.

1:20:12.599 --> 1:20:15.306
And you're here
to take care of me, is that it?

1:20:15.519 --> 1:20:17.305
Hole in one.

1:20:19.606 --> 1:20:21.142
Why?

1:20:21.358 --> 1:20:23.349
Why?

1:20:24.737 --> 1:20:28.446
Because I've decided
a piece of chicken-fried crap like you

1:20:28.657 --> 1:20:30.613
doesn't deserve to live.

1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:33.025
Not with so many good men dying.

1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:39.494
- Those good men caused this mess.
- Ohh.

1:26:14.961 --> 1:26:16.952
Come down
and eat chicken with me, beautiful.

1:26:17.130 --> 1:26:18.336
It's so dark!

1:27:02.551 --> 1:27:04.633
Abagail:
You come and see me, St...

1:27:04.803 --> 1:27:06.339
You and all your friends.

1:27:06.471 --> 1:27:10.384
We got to get started. Time's short.

1:27:21.319 --> 1:27:23.856
Abagall freemantle.

1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:27.606
Hemingford home.

1:27:49.848 --> 1:27:51.964
Abagail: You come see me.

1:27:52.142 --> 1:27:55.430
You and all your friends.
