00:02.003 --> 00:03.493
Previously on Lost:

00:03.921 --> 00:07.664
They come, they fight, they destroy,

00:07.758 --> 00:10.795
they corrupt. It always ends the same.

00:11.846 --> 00:16.806
But it only ends once. Anything that
happens before that is just progress.

00:16.893 --> 00:19.100
I'm not gonna kill Jacob, Ben.

00:20.438 --> 00:21.518
You are.

00:21.606 --> 00:23.016
Do what I asked you to, Ben.

00:23.107 --> 00:24.893
I want you to understand one thing.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.691
You have a choice.

00:30.573 --> 00:32.154
They're coming.

00:37.914 --> 00:41.702
The Dharma folks at the Swan worksite,
they're gonna dri|| into the ground

00:41.792 --> 00:44.329
and accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy.

00:44.420 --> 00:48.834
I think I can negate that energy.
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

00:48.925 --> 00:52.008
If we can do what Faraday said,
our plane never crashes.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.176
Flight 815 lands in Los Angeles.

00:56.599 --> 00:58.260
Hurry up, doc!
What are you waiting for?

01:09.779 --> 01:11.144
We hit the pocket!

01:18.120 --> 01:19.826
- Juliet!
- No!

01:21.499 --> 01:23.831
lgotyou.
No,dontletgo!

01:24.919 --> 01:26.659
Juliet! No!

01:33.678 --> 01:35.384
Come on!

01:38.683 --> 01:42.346
Come on! Come on, you son of a bitch!

02:19.181 --> 02:20.512
So how's the drink?

02:23.936 --> 02:27.474
- It's good.
- That's not a very strong reaction.

02:27.565 --> 02:30.648
Well, it's...
It's not a very strong drink.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.778
- Don't tell anyone.
- It'll be our secret.

02:47.460 --> 02:51.203
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has
turned on the "fasten seat belts" sign.

02:51.297 --> 02:54.039
- Please return to your seats.
- It's normal.

02:54.133 --> 02:57.341
My husband said the planes
want to stay in the air.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.257
Sounds like a smart man.

03:01.349 --> 03:04.967
You be sure and tell him that
when he gets back from the bathroom.

03:05.061 --> 03:07.552
Well, I'll keep you company
until he does.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.182
Don't worry, it'll be...

03:29.794 --> 03:31.625
You can let go now.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.124
It's OK. You can let go.

03:47.228 --> 03:51.847
- Looks like we made it.
- Yeah. We sure did.

03:51.941 --> 03:55.559
Sorry about the unexpected bumps, folks.
We just hit a pocket of rough air.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.518
It should be a smooth ride
from here on out.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.979
Remind me to hold it next time, will ya?

04:03.994 --> 04:06.406
I almost died in that bathroom.

04:06.497 --> 04:09.614
Now I know how the laundry feels
when it's in the dryer.

04:13.045 --> 04:16.663
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too, beautiful.

05:04.013 --> 05:07.301
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, mate. Is this your seat?

05:07.391 --> 05:09.848
- The stewardess said it was empty.
- No, I'm at the window.

05:09.935 --> 05:10.924
Oh, right.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.982
Do you mind if! sit here?

05:19.069 --> 05:21.936
The fella next to me has been
snoring since we took off from Sydney.

05:23.449 --> 05:25.531
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks, brother.

05:38.631 --> 05:40.747
- Something wrong?
- No, you just...

05:41.425 --> 05:42.835
Do I know you from somewhere?

05:45.930 --> 05:47.420
Well, I'm not sure.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.596
- Desmond.
- Jack.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.472
Nice to meet you, Jack.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.265
Or to see you again.

07:38.792 --> 07:44.788
Juliet! I got you.
No! No, don't let go!

07:45.549 --> 07:48.086
Juliet! No!

07:48.802 --> 07:52.715
Come on. Come on, you son of a bitch!

08:43.107 --> 08:44.688
Hey!

09:17.683 --> 09:19.173
Hello?

09:25.983 --> 09:27.143
Hello?!

09:39.329 --> 09:40.489
Hey!

09:41.248 --> 09:45.036
Hey! Hey! Kate!
It's OK. It's me, Miles. It's OK.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.250
- What happened?
- What?

09:50.340 --> 09:51.921
Where are we?

09:52.009 --> 09:54.500
I can't... I can't hear you.
Are your ears ringing?

09:58.640 --> 10:00.050
What is it?

10:05.147 --> 10:07.388
- We're back.
- Back where?

10:19.995 --> 10:21.075
No.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.200
Is that the construction site?

10:25.542 --> 10:27.999
No. That's the Swan hatch...

10:29.004 --> 10:30.790
...after Desmond blew it up.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.210
Guess we're not in 1977.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.932
Jack? Jack.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.226
Can you hear me? Jack!

10:55.948 --> 10:57.108
What happened?

10:59.076 --> 11:01.818
- Where are we?
- At the hatch.

11:15.217 --> 11:19.460
- What? They built it?
- Yeah. They built it.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.093
Sawyer!

11:27.771 --> 11:28.851
You were wrong!

11:30.107 --> 11:32.143
That's the damn Swan hatch!

11:32.734 --> 11:37.398
Blown up, just like we left it,
before we started jumping through time!

11:38.448 --> 11:40.825
You said we could stop it
from ever being built!

11:40.909 --> 11:43.321
That our plane would never
crash on this island!

11:43.412 --> 11:46.324
- Stop it! Stop it!
- This ain't LAX!

11:46.415 --> 11:48.701
You blew us right back
where we started!

11:50.252 --> 11:51.287
Except Juliet's dead.

11:54.006 --> 11:56.543
She's dead, you son of a bitch,
'cause you were wrong.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.004
Sawyer...

12:01.972 --> 12:03.553
...l'm sorry.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.135
I thought we were supposed to...

12:08.103 --> 12:10.469
- I thought it would work.
- Well, it didn't!

12:24.912 --> 12:28.700
- You in line?
- No, l'mjust waiting for my friend.

12:31.335 --> 12:35.078
- I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
- It's OK. It's OK.

12:35.172 --> 12:37.083
Best get back to our seats, sweetheart.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.018
Lasagna.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.763
No. No knife and fork for you, honey.

12:54.858 --> 12:58.191
What do you think I'm gonna do,
stab you and run?

13:00.030 --> 13:01.895
Hey, watch where you're going, buddy.

13:05.077 --> 13:07.614
Sorry. My bad.

13:10.207 --> 13:12.789
Say it. Come on, please? Just once.

13:12.876 --> 13:15.959
- I really don't want to, dude.
- I love those commercials.

13:16.046 --> 13:19.209
Come on, just do the Australian accent,
and I'll leave you alone.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.547
All right. Fine. All right.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.214
Have a cluckity-cluck day, mate!

13:28.225 --> 13:29.214
That's...

13:30.894 --> 13:32.350
You know who this is?

13:32.437 --> 13:34.849
This is the owner
of Mr. Cluck's Chicken.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.852
And he's back here
riding coach with the rest of us yutzes!

13:39.069 --> 13:42.311
- How about that?
- Hey... Do you mind me asking,

13:42.406 --> 13:46.399
how exactly did a guy like you
get to own a major corporation?

13:46.493 --> 13:50.281
I won the lottery
and I like chicken, so I bought it.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.073
Good. Good for you.

13:58.422 --> 14:01.630
You know, you really shouldn't
tell people you won the lottery.

14:01.717 --> 14:02.752
Yeah? Why not?

14:02.843 --> 14:05.425
'Cause they'll take advantage of you.
That's why not.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.509
Thanks for the advice,
but it's not gonna happen.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.976
It's not?

14:12.060 --> 14:15.177
Nope. Nothing bad ever happens to me.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.351
I'm the luckiest guy alive.

14:30.454 --> 14:33.196
- Whatjust happened?
- I found a flashlight.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.451
Dude, who cares?
The sky just went from day to night.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.204
- What happened?!
- I think we moved through time.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.043
How do you know that?

14:41.131 --> 14:44.373
White flash. Headache. Can't hear.

14:44.468 --> 14:47.084
- Happened to me before.
- What about Jack and everyone else?

14:47.179 --> 14:48.760
- They move through time, too?
- I don't know.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.213
They took one of the vans
and went up to the worksite.

14:51.308 --> 14:54.220
And then I heard gunfire.

14:54.311 --> 14:57.269
- ...back to this island!
- You hear that, dude?

14:57.355 --> 14:59.892
- lt's Sawyer.
- Stay here with Sayid.

14:59.983 --> 15:03.896
If you've got an explanation, Jack,
I'm waiting to hear it!

15:03.987 --> 15:05.898
The bomb must've gone off.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.822
Think if the atom bomb went off,
we'd still be standing here?!

15:09.409 --> 15:11.786
- I don't know.
- That's right! You don't!

15:11.870 --> 15:14.577
- For once, you don't know!
- Jack!

15:16.374 --> 15:18.660
- Sayid needs help.
- Where is he?

15:18.752 --> 15:21.243
With Hurley at the van.
Two minutes away.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.545
He's still bleeding.
We don't know what to do.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.583
Help me.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.255
What do you say, Doc?
Got another great idea to save Sayid?

15:33.350 --> 15:35.807
- Maybe there's a nuke laying around.
- Hey, shut up!

15:41.525 --> 15:42.731
Help!

15:47.864 --> 15:48.899
Juliet!

15:50.033 --> 15:51.898
- James?
- Oh, my God.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.401
Juliet!

15:59.000 --> 16:00.956
Oh, God. Oh, God, this is gross.

16:06.216 --> 16:09.504
Don't worry, dude.
Everything's gonna be fine.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.046
When I die...

16:16.726 --> 16:19.513
...what do you think will happen to me?

16:20.814 --> 16:22.224
Just try not to talk, dude.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.481
l've tortured more people
than I can remember.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.814
l've murdered.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.896
Wherever I'm going...

16:32.576 --> 16:34.487
...it can't be very pleasant.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.240
- Sayid, come on.
- I deserve it.

16:43.253 --> 16:44.743
Hello?

16:47.757 --> 16:49.008
Jin?

16:55.098 --> 16:56.087
Jin!

17:00.562 --> 17:02.098
l've gota gun!

17:02.189 --> 17:03.975
And I know how to shoot it!

17:32.093 --> 17:33.503
Hello, Hugo.

17:35.305 --> 17:36.670
You got a minute?

18:14.177 --> 18:15.713
You're wasting your time, man.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.754
This plane goes down
in the ocean out here,

18:19.849 --> 18:22.682
I think our chances of survival
are exactly zero.

18:24.312 --> 18:28.271
Actually, in calm seas
with a good pilot,

18:28.358 --> 18:30.269
we could survive a water landing.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.646
And the fuel tanks are buoyant enough

18:32.737 --> 18:35.114
to keep us afloat
until we got in the life rafts.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.695
- What?
- No, it's impressive you know that.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.578
What were you doing in Australia?
Business or pleasure?

18:46.251 --> 18:47.866
Pleasure. You?

18:49.004 --> 18:52.622
I went down to get my sister
out of a bad relationship

18:52.716 --> 18:56.300
that, it turns out,
she didn't want to get out of.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.048
So... here I am.

19:00.557 --> 19:03.048
So, what, you were just
down under for vacation?

19:04.394 --> 19:07.557
- Actually, I went on a walkabout.
- Really?

19:08.815 --> 19:13.400
- Like... like Crocodile Dundee?
- No, not exactly.

19:13.486 --> 19:17.820
But... But it was pretty intense.
We spent ten days in the outback

19:17.907 --> 19:21.195
in nothing but our packs and our knives.

19:21.286 --> 19:24.028
We slept under the stars
and made our own fires,

19:24.122 --> 19:27.239
- hunted our own food.
- Wow.

19:29.127 --> 19:31.334
I wouldn't make it two days
without my cell phone.

19:33.923 --> 19:38.087
- You're not pulling my leg, are ya?
- Why would I pull your leg?

19:41.097 --> 19:44.715
This thing goes down,
I'm sticking with you.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.757
You can stop staring at the fire.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.055
Jacob's gone.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.883
He's gone.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.718
Why didn't he fight back?

20:33.650 --> 20:35.390
Why did he let mejust kill him?

20:35.485 --> 20:37.817
I guess he knew that he was beaten.

20:42.033 --> 20:45.491
Ben, I want you to go outside

20:45.578 --> 20:49.537
and tell Richard
that I need to talk to him.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.620
Talk to him about what?

20:54.003 --> 20:55.834
That's between me and Richard.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.668
- There's no other reason.
- That's not how it's gonna be.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.550
- You have to...
- You're not going in there.

21:06.641 --> 21:09.178
Listen to me. I already did.
Now I'm asking you to...

21:13.064 --> 21:15.680
Just back up a little. Back up.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.570
Who are they?

21:20.655 --> 21:24.398
Other than the fact that I know
they were on the Ajira flight with us,

21:25.118 --> 21:28.406
all I know is they knocked me out
and dragged my ass to some cabin,

21:28.496 --> 21:30.111
which they promptly burned, then...

21:30.874 --> 21:33.866
...brought me here
along with the dead guy in the box.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.248
They say they're the good guys.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.794
I'm not buying it either.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.471
Listen to me. Listen to me,
and listen carefully.

21:48.558 --> 21:51.265
No one goes in there
unless Jacob invites them in.

21:51.352 --> 21:54.515
Richard, that's why we're here,
because Jacob invited us.

21:54.606 --> 21:57.313
Asking me what's in the shadow of the
statue, doesn't mean you're in charge.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.982
- Then who is?
- Richard.

22:02.197 --> 22:03.733
Ben.

22:05.074 --> 22:07.816
- What happened in there?
- Everything's fine.

22:07.911 --> 22:10.243
John wants to speak to you.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.946
- ls Jacob all right?
- I'm sorry. Who are you?

22:13.041 --> 22:16.158
- Answer her question, Ben.
- Well, of course Jacob's all right.

22:16.252 --> 22:20.120
They're both together inside.
John just wants to talk to you.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.539
- John wants to talk to me?
- That's right.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.672
What are you doing?
I don't understand.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.594
I'm happy to talk to John.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.593
But, before I do, maybe you
should talk to him first.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.958
Hang on, Juliet! We're coming!

23:04.842 --> 23:06.628
Jin. Flashlight.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.844
If we could move this beam,
I think I can get down there!

23:28.866 --> 23:32.154
Too heavy. We need
something to pull it. Jin!

23:33.371 --> 23:35.578
The van!
There's chains in it. Go get 'em!

23:45.133 --> 23:46.373
Where you going, dude?

23:47.218 --> 23:48.594
And what are you doing here?

23:49.178 --> 23:53.171
I mean, I meet you in a taxi,
you know everything about me,

23:53.266 --> 23:55.552
you give me a plane ticket,
which just so happens

23:55.643 --> 23:58.806
to get me back on this island.
How'd you know that was gonna happen?

24:01.190 --> 24:02.805
Hello!

24:06.112 --> 24:08.694
Can you hear me? Why aren't
you answering my questions?

24:10.366 --> 24:12.948
My friend Jin's gonna be here
any second, so stop ignoring me...

24:13.036 --> 24:14.822
Your friend Jin won't be able to see me.

24:14.912 --> 24:18.780
- Why not?
- Because I died an hour ago.

24:21.002 --> 24:24.620
- Sorry, dude. That sucks.
- Thanks.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.545
How'd you die?

24:27.550 --> 24:30.462
l was killed by an old friend
who grew tired of my company.

24:36.059 --> 24:37.924
You want me to do
something crazy again?

24:38.019 --> 24:41.432
No. I need you to save Sayid, Hugo.

24:42.732 --> 24:45.189
- That's why Jin went to get Jack...
- Jin can't help him.

24:45.276 --> 24:48.109
You need to take Sayid to the Temple.

24:48.196 --> 24:50.107
That's the only chance he's got.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.109
And the rest of them will be safe there.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.532
The Temple?
I'm supposed to know what that is?

24:54.619 --> 24:55.825
Jin knows.

24:55.912 --> 24:59.825
Tell him to take you to the hole in the
wall where he was with the French team.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.908
Through that opening,
you can get into the Temple.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.918
You still have
that guitar case I gave you?

25:07.048 --> 25:09.039
- Yeah.
- Bring it.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.750
Who are you, dude?

25:14.347 --> 25:15.553
l'm Jacob.

25:22.146 --> 25:26.014
Hurley! Help me with Sayid.

25:26.109 --> 25:28.771
We have to get him into the van.
Juliet needs our help.

25:29.862 --> 25:30.897
Come on! We have to go!

25:42.417 --> 25:45.784
Jin, if! asked you to take me to
where there's, like, a hole in the wall,

25:45.878 --> 25:49.166
where you went with the French team,
would you know what I was talking about?

25:51.259 --> 25:53.375
- Yes.
- Good.

26:04.355 --> 26:06.220
I'll get the chain.

26:08.985 --> 26:10.145
Juliet?

26:11.487 --> 26:14.445
Stop it. Stop, Sawyer.
The van is here. The chains are coming.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.160
She ain't making any more noises.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.913
She knows we're here.
She's probably just resting.

26:28.004 --> 26:29.585
Juliet!

26:36.596 --> 26:38.461
If she dies, I'll kill him.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.099
Ladies and gentlemen,
nothing to be alarmed about,

26:48.191 --> 26:51.524
but if there is a doctor on board,
would you please press your call button?

26:55.239 --> 26:56.490
Sir, you're a doctor?

26:56.574 --> 26:58.565
- Yes.
- Could you come with me, please?

26:59.494 --> 27:03.203
We appreciate your help. A passenger
went into the restroom half an hour ago,

27:03.289 --> 27:05.154
and he's not responding when we knock.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.501
This man's a doctor.

27:07.585 --> 27:11.123
- If he's unconscious in there...
- The lock. lt's jammed or something.

27:11.214 --> 27:12.545
Can I be of assistance?

27:13.716 --> 27:14.831
Excuse me.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.098
He's not breathing.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.981
What's going on back there, Earhart?

27:40.076 --> 27:42.692
Everything's fine, sir.
Please just stay in your seat.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.027
Looks peachy.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.950
- I'm gonna need your help.
- What can I do?

27:47.041 --> 27:48.201
I need you...

27:49.544 --> 27:51.910
Hold this over his nose and mouth.
Hold it there,

27:52.004 --> 27:54.495
- and do not let any air escape.
- OK. Now?

27:54.590 --> 27:55.875
Yes, now.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.841
Something's blocking his air passage.

28:09.564 --> 28:12.271
We have to open it up. I need
something sharp... A razor.

28:14.485 --> 28:16.146
- I got a
_ pen.
A pen?

28:16.237 --> 28:18.569
lt's regulations.
There's nothing sharp.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.692
A pen! Just a pen.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.739
I had a pen in my jacket, but it's gone.

28:23.619 --> 28:24.904
Damn it.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.162
I got it. I got it.

28:41.888 --> 28:44.630
Relax. Just relax. Breathe.

28:49.937 --> 28:50.926
Am I alive?

28:52.481 --> 28:53.982
Yeah. Yeah, you're alive.

28:57.445 --> 28:58.560
Terrific.

29:14.003 --> 29:17.336
- You got it?
- OK, Jin! We're good down here!

29:20.760 --> 29:22.250
Hit it!

29:35.149 --> 29:36.764
Give me the flashlight.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.577
Juliet.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.135
OK. All right.

30:07.223 --> 30:09.054
Juliet. Come here.

30:12.645 --> 30:13.885
Juliet?

30:14.563 --> 30:16.474
Hey, hey, hey.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.352
I'm here. Come on, baby.
Hey, come on, wake up.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.104
Wake up.

30:25.908 --> 30:26.897
Hi.

30:28.411 --> 30:29.947
Hey.

30:34.625 --> 30:37.287
Where... Where are we?

30:37.378 --> 30:40.711
Don't worry about that. You're fine.

30:40.798 --> 30:42.754
I gotta get you out of here, OK?

30:47.972 --> 30:50.054
It didn't work.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.590
We're still on the island.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.854
It's OK. It's OK.

30:55.938 --> 30:58.645
| just gotta get this loose enough
to get you out, OK?

30:58.733 --> 31:01.600
No, I hit the bomb.
You're still here.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.441
You what?

31:04.864 --> 31:06.445
You hit the bomb?

31:08.159 --> 31:09.615
Why?

31:12.705 --> 31:14.787
I wanted you to be able to go home.

31:16.167 --> 31:19.204
I wanted to make it so that
you never came to this damn island.

31:20.337 --> 31:21.747
And it didn't work.

31:23.424 --> 31:25.460
Don't you worry about that.

31:26.135 --> 31:28.296
You're gonna be OK.

31:30.514 --> 31:34.348
I'm gonna get you out of here and we're
gonna go home together. You hear me?

31:35.853 --> 31:37.093
Sawyer?

31:48.407 --> 31:51.615
Even though I could get the bullet out,
the bleeding won't stop.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.283
There's nothing I can do for him.

31:55.748 --> 31:56.988
There's something I can do.

31:58.334 --> 32:01.167
There's a temple. If we can
get Sayid there, we can save him.

32:02.546 --> 32:04.002
And you know this how?

32:04.090 --> 32:06.297
This guy, Jacob, told me
just before he got here.

32:06.383 --> 32:07.509
Who's Jacob?

32:07.593 --> 32:10.756
Does it matter?
Can you fix Sayid, Jack?

32:13.724 --> 32:14.759
No.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.886
Then you're gonna have to let me do it.

32:26.362 --> 32:29.570
Ben, you need to talk to me.

32:29.657 --> 32:33.024
I can't stop them unless you tell me
what happened. What happened to Jacob?

32:36.288 --> 32:38.449
You and l have known
each other for 30 years.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.202
I'm asking you this as a friend.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.375
You wanna know
what happened, Richard?

32:56.475 --> 32:58.261
- What are you doing?
- We're going in,

32:58.352 --> 32:59.637
and he's coming with us.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.608
Where's Richard?

33:17.288 --> 33:18.619
He's not coming.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.330
Then who is that behind you?

33:31.093 --> 33:33.425
- Where's Jacob?
- Jacob is dead.

33:37.183 --> 33:40.016
- Who are you?
- Don't worry about me.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.553
Let's talk about you.

33:43.647 --> 33:47.185
I'm assuming that you are...
what, Jacob's bodyguards,

33:47.276 --> 33:50.313
and that you came all the way
to this island to protect him?

33:50.863 --> 33:52.603
Well, l have good news.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.734
Jacob burned up
right there in that fire.

33:57.286 --> 34:00.619
Therefore, there's nothing left
for you to protect. You can go.

34:03.334 --> 34:04.414
You're free.

34:08.172 --> 34:09.252
Kill him!

34:10.341 --> 34:12.127
Spread out! Get him!

34:15.054 --> 34:16.464
Where is he?!

36:14.757 --> 36:17.123
I'm sorry you had to see me like that.

36:24.600 --> 36:29.264
- Sawyer? Is she OK?
- I'm working on it!

36:46.372 --> 36:48.283
- OK, I got you.
- James.

36:48.374 --> 36:53.209
I got you. OK.
There you are. OK. OK.

36:53.295 --> 36:55.286
Don't worry.

37:00.803 --> 37:02.464
We could get coffee some time.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.884
I gotta get you out of here.

37:08.185 --> 37:09.641
We can go Dutch.

37:15.442 --> 37:18.525
Hey... Juliet?

37:20.489 --> 37:21.695
It's me.

37:23.659 --> 37:26.116
- James.
- Yeah?

37:27.329 --> 37:28.694
Kiss me.

37:32.376 --> 37:34.287
You got it, Blondie.

37:58.235 --> 37:59.771
l have to tell you something.

38:01.029 --> 38:02.894
It's really, really important.

38:05.868 --> 38:07.324
You tell me.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.570
You tell me.

38:15.878 --> 38:17.869
Julie?

38:19.756 --> 38:21.337
You tell me.

38:25.762 --> 38:26.751
Oh, God.

38:27.848 --> 38:29.759
I'm here.

38:29.850 --> 38:32.091
l'm... I'm here, baby.

39:03.634 --> 39:05.374
You did this.

39:14.645 --> 39:16.761
You should've let that happen, man.

39:17.314 --> 39:19.020
l was supposed to die.

39:22.611 --> 39:26.945
Don't take it personally. Some people
just don't know how to say thanks.

39:41.964 --> 39:44.751
Excuse me, do you know what happened
to the guy sitting next to me?

39:44.841 --> 39:46.581
Oh, we were asleep.

39:49.179 --> 39:51.295
Ladies and gentlemen,
Captain Norris here.

39:51.390 --> 39:55.224
We 're now beginning our final descent
into Los Ange/es International Airport.

39:55.310 --> 39:58.097
I'm happy to tell you it's
a beautiful day in Los Angeles.

39:58.188 --> 40:00.804
Seventy-two degrees,
six miles visibility

40:00.899 --> 40:03.356
and winds out of the southwest
at five miles an hour.

40:03.443 --> 40:06.571
Buckle up. You're almost home.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.737
I'll be putting on the
"fasten seat belts" sign now.

40:08.824 --> 40:12.487
We '/I be on the ground in a few minutes.
Thank you for flying Oceanic Air.

44:30.126 --> 44:32.082
We gonna sing Kumbaya on the way?

44:32.963 --> 44:36.046
- It's not a guitar, man.
- Then what is it?

44:41.680 --> 44:44.922
- You going with them?
- No, I'm gonna bury her.

44:46.017 --> 44:49.680
- Let me help you.
- Help Sayid.

44:53.775 --> 44:56.767
Hey, Miles. You mind hangin' back?

44:58.405 --> 44:59.986
You got it, boss.

45:00.949 --> 45:03.531
I'll make sure to leave a trail
so you can follow us.

45:03.618 --> 45:06.451
I ain't followin' nobody, Kate.

45:14.462 --> 45:15.793
You guys ready?

45:17.132 --> 45:18.121
Whenever you are.

45:50.957 --> 45:52.788
Oceanic passenger Jack Shephard.

45:52.876 --> 45:56.664
Jack Shephard, please go
to the nearest courtesy desk.

46:00.383 --> 46:04.251
Hi. I'm Jack Shephard.
l was just paged.

46:04.346 --> 46:08.055
Oh, Mr. Shephard.
Hello. Yes, that was me.

46:08.767 --> 46:10.553
Sorry, I meant to meet you at the gate.

46:10.644 --> 46:12.976
Well, I'm here now, so...

46:13.063 --> 46:16.305
Mr. Shephard, I am deeply sorry,
but there seems to have been a mix-up

46:16.399 --> 46:19.857
involving the cargo
you checked in Sydney.

46:20.695 --> 46:22.777
- Cargo?
- Yes, sir. A coffin.

46:24.991 --> 46:27.277
I don't... I don't understand.

46:27.369 --> 46:29.075
Are you saying that it's not here?

46:29.704 --> 46:31.740
It appears it was never
put on the plane.

46:35.710 --> 46:39.453
The funeral is in two hours.
When is it getting here?

46:39.547 --> 46:42.459
Mr. Shephard, I can't tell you
how deeply sorry we are,

46:42.550 --> 46:44.757
but we don't know when it will arrive...

46:46.471 --> 46:48.712
...because we're not
exactly sure where it is.

47:14.374 --> 47:15.955
That's a big wall.

47:17.419 --> 47:19.250
How are we gonna get him over the top?

47:21.756 --> 47:24.748
We're not.
We're bringing him in through here.

47:36.146 --> 47:37.135
Yeah.

47:58.460 --> 48:00.075
Who brings a book into a cave?

48:07.510 --> 48:09.296
And why is his arm missing?

48:10.722 --> 48:13.429
It was ripped off when he was
attacked by the black smoke.

48:17.479 --> 48:19.720
Well... this is gonna be awesome.

48:42.378 --> 48:43.959
- Watch your step.
- Yeah.

48:51.179 --> 48:52.419
OK.

49:31.719 --> 49:33.220
Where's Kate?

49:34.347 --> 49:37.680
- She was right over there.
- Kate?

49:41.980 --> 49:42.969
Kate!

49:45.108 --> 49:46.689
Can you hear me?!

49:49.904 --> 49:51.155
Kate!

49:54.617 --> 49:57.654
- Jack! We can't leave Say...
- Hey, let him go!

49:58.496 --> 50:00.737
- Hurle
y!
- Jin!

50:02.917 --> 50:04.293
Hurley!

50:32.030 --> 50:34.021
- You OK?
- Yeah. You?

50:34.115 --> 50:35.616
Yeah.

50:57.805 --> 50:59.966
Guess we found the Temple.

51:02.518 --> 51:05.055
- Anything to declare?
- Just a murderer.

51:05.146 --> 51:07.137
Flights one through seven...

51:08.107 --> 51:11.315
- Visitors, please use lines...
- OK.

51:13.279 --> 51:15.235
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- Hold it.

51:15.323 --> 51:17.780
- I can't hold it.
- Sure you can, kiddo.

51:17.867 --> 51:19.949
- I believe in you.
- Edward...

51:20.995 --> 51:21.984
...please.

51:24.707 --> 51:26.163
All right. Come on.

51:28.336 --> 51:32.204
Is anybody in here?
Is anybody in the ladies' room?

51:33.174 --> 51:34.675
Don't move.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.168
OK.

51:40.056 --> 51:42.012
- You've got two minutes.
- Thank you.

52:14.424 --> 52:16.415
- You done?
- Not yet.

52:30.815 --> 52:32.521
All right, time's up! Get out of there.

52:32.608 --> 52:34.985
- One minute.
- No, open this door right now.

52:35.069 --> 52:38.027
- I'm not finished.
- Yes, you are. Open it.

52:38.906 --> 52:41.522
Austen, I swear, you don't
open this door, I'm coming in!

52:59.761 --> 53:03.174
Although I've seen it before,
it was something... Oh, my God.

53:03.264 --> 53:05.505
He just walked in here and attacked me.

53:05.600 --> 53:09.263
I pushed him. ljust...
I need to get out of here.

53:16.944 --> 53:18.935
Officer, come quick. Come quick.

53:19.822 --> 53:21.107
Wait, hold the door!

53:26.496 --> 53:28.407
Welcome aboard.

53:31.125 --> 53:33.912
We were on the same flight. Sydney.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.206
How about that?

53:51.104 --> 53:52.685
Ganson, Calhoun, what's your 20?

53:53.815 --> 53:57.057
We're on the South elevator,
headed to ground.

53:57.151 --> 54:00.484
Get your asses to International
Baggage Claim. We've got a 341.

54:00.863 --> 54:05.573
- Yeah. We're on our way.
- Sounds serious. What's a 341?

54:06.327 --> 54:08.818
- That's confidential, sir.
- If it's confidential,

54:08.913 --> 54:11.325
how the hell am I supposed
to know if I see one?

54:13.709 --> 54:16.576
Sorry. Excuse me. Ladies first.

54:17.380 --> 54:19.666
- Thanks.
- Take care.

54:31.644 --> 54:32.850
Hey.

54:33.479 --> 54:36.812
- I think that'll do it, boss.
- Stop calling me "boss."

54:37.567 --> 54:40.900
- You ain't my deputy anymore.
- You got it.

54:43.531 --> 54:45.943
Are you thirsty? I think I saw
some beers in the van.

54:46.033 --> 54:49.366
- Construction guys hid 'em in...
- What'd she want to tell me, Miles?

54:50.455 --> 54:52.446
- Excuse me?
- Juliet.

54:54.417 --> 54:56.908
She wanted to tell me something,
and then she died.

54:57.003 --> 54:58.834
What was it, Miles?

54:59.547 --> 55:01.333
That's why you asked me
to stay with you?

55:02.216 --> 55:04.548
You're the only one around
that talks to dead people.

55:07.180 --> 55:12.470
- Jim, that's not how it works.
- What did she wanna tell me, Miles?

55:13.519 --> 55:15.305
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

55:15.396 --> 55:17.808
- It's not gonna help.
- Just do it. Just ask her...

55:17.899 --> 55:18.888
She's gone, James.

55:22.069 --> 55:24.731
I know she's gone. I know.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.193
Now tell me.

55:29.410 --> 55:30.741
OK.

55:33.706 --> 55:35.947
OK. All right.

55:36.584 --> 55:38.074
All right.

56:05.863 --> 56:08.900
- What?
- It worked.

56:11.327 --> 56:14.535
- What did she want to tell me?
- That's what she wanted to tell you.

56:16.374 --> 56:17.363
"It worked."

56:27.468 --> 56:28.799
What worked?

56:47.572 --> 56:48.687
Stop right here.

57:02.003 --> 57:03.118
Who are you?

57:04.880 --> 57:06.495
I know who they are.

57:09.051 --> 57:10.666
They were on the first plane...

57:12.221 --> 57:14.837
...Oceanic 815, along with me.

57:26.485 --> 57:27.986
You sure?

57:32.241 --> 57:33.651
Shoot 'em.

57:34.744 --> 57:36.826
- No, hey! No!
- Jacob sent us!

57:40.875 --> 57:42.365
What did you just say?

57:43.294 --> 57:44.955
I said Jacob sent us.

57:46.213 --> 57:48.044
He said you would help our friend.

57:52.595 --> 57:54.005
He wants you to prove it.

58:02.021 --> 58:04.012
He gave me that guitar case!

58:09.528 --> 58:12.895
- Did you look inside it?
- Maybe.

58:44.647 --> 58:45.636
Dude!

59:01.122 --> 59:04.785
- What are your names?
- Hugo.

59:05.835 --> 59:06.995
Hugo Reyes.

59:08.963 --> 59:10.123
Tell him.

59:12.216 --> 59:14.172
Jin Soo Kwon.

59:15.594 --> 59:16.629
Kate Austen.

59:17.930 --> 59:18.919
Jack Shephard.

59:21.475 --> 59:25.138
- What about him?
- Sayid Jarrah.

59:38.743 --> 59:41.155
Pick him up.
Get him to the spring.

59:42.329 --> 59:44.160
Hey! Excuse me.

59:45.332 --> 59:48.995
I carried that case across the ocean
and, like, through time.

59:50.171 --> 59:51.661
I wanna know what that paper says.

59:57.470 --> 59:59.335
That paper said if your friend dies...

1:00:00.681 --> 1:00:02.672
...we're all in a lot of trouble.

1:00:16.655 --> 1:00:19.943
- All passengers, please have...
- And what business are you in, sir?

1:00:21.076 --> 1:00:22.202
No English.

1:00:23.037 --> 1:00:25.870
Be prepared to show your
passport to Customs ofﬁcers.

1:00:29.043 --> 1:00:31.284
This letter says
the watch is a business gift.

1:00:31.378 --> 1:00:33.869
But can you tell me
what business you're in?

1:01:02.076 --> 1:01:03.441
What are you doing with this?

1:01:06.455 --> 1:01:09.242
Anything over $10,000
has to be declared.

1:01:10.751 --> 1:01:14.039
You... didn't... declare this.

1:01:18.634 --> 1:01:21.501
Sir, you're gonna have to come with me.
Let's go have a talk.

1:01:22.638 --> 1:01:24.094
This way.

1:01:25.891 --> 1:01:28.303
Anne, take her to the waiting area.

1:01:28.686 --> 1:01:31.849
Ms. Paik? Do you
understand any English?

1:01:31.939 --> 1:01:36.683
Because, if you do, if this
is just a misunderstanding,

1:01:36.777 --> 1:01:38.142
you should speak up now.

1:01:40.489 --> 1:01:42.445
Do you understand me?

1:01:46.078 --> 1:01:48.911
No... English.

1:02:17.985 --> 1:02:19.316
The water isn't clear.

1:02:20.070 --> 1:02:21.685
What happened?

1:03:01.028 --> 1:03:03.189
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

1:03:13.624 --> 1:03:15.535
Who did this to him?

1:03:16.961 --> 1:03:19.919
It's my fault. I didn't
shoot him, but it's my fault.

1:03:26.220 --> 1:03:28.711
If we do this, there are risks.

1:03:34.103 --> 1:03:35.183
You understand?

1:03:36.981 --> 1:03:38.096
Do what you have to do.

1:03:44.738 --> 1:03:46.899
Take off the coveralls, put him in.

1:04:25.237 --> 1:04:26.272
What are they doing?

1:04:30.075 --> 1:04:32.191
Can unconscious people
hold their breath?

1:04:32.286 --> 1:04:33.275
No.

1:04:43.630 --> 1:04:45.131
He's awake. Let him up.

1:04:50.304 --> 1:04:51.464
What are they waiting for?

1:04:54.349 --> 1:04:55.600
That's enough!

1:04:59.313 --> 1:05:00.473
Let him up!

1:05:06.820 --> 1:05:09.027
You're not saving him!
You're drowning him!

1:06:20.477 --> 1:06:22.342
Your friend is dead.

1:07:01.101 --> 1:07:02.511
Jack.

1:07:04.271 --> 1:07:06.011
Jack, stop.
What are you doing?

1:07:15.991 --> 1:07:17.572
Jack, he's dead.

1:07:19.870 --> 1:07:21.826
He's not coming back. Stop it!

1:07:40.140 --> 1:07:43.758
Passengers arriving on
flight 2230 from Argentina,

1:07:43.852 --> 1:07:46.639
claim your baggage on carousel three.

1:07:57.866 --> 1:07:59.276
Attention all passengers

1:07:59.368 --> 1:08:02.826
arriving on flight 3226
from Sao Paulo, Brazil,

1:08:02.913 --> 1:08:05.404
please proceed to Baggage Claim Five.

1:08:29.940 --> 1:08:32.352
Announcing the arrival
of flight 150 from Quito.

1:08:32.442 --> 1:08:35.479
A// passengers will
disembark from door 85.

1:08:48.041 --> 1:08:50.532
Welcome to Los Ange/es
International Airport.

1:08:50.627 --> 1:08:54.085
This is a nonsmoking facility.
Thank you.

1:08:55.090 --> 1:08:58.674
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don't think so, lady. There's a line.

1:09:01.221 --> 1:09:02.882
There's a line!

1:09:03.974 --> 1:09:07.262
- Sorry.
- Where are we on the Outback grosses?

1:09:07.352 --> 1:09:11.015
Laura get a response
on title registration?

1:09:11.106 --> 1:09:12.971
Well, it should've cleared.

1:09:13.859 --> 1:09:17.226
Outback's just a name. What are they
saying, they own the entire Outback?

1:09:18.613 --> 1:09:19.739
That's just stupid.

1:09:19.823 --> 1:09:21.688
Have 'em cover it, OK?

1:09:21.783 --> 1:09:24.820
This girl should be coming out
of Customs, so take the other door.

1:09:24.911 --> 1:09:27.903
Oh, I didn't get the
Tustin inventory report yet.

1:09:31.084 --> 1:09:33.496
Go on down there. Get on it.

1:09:39.468 --> 1:09:40.548
Hey!

1:09:41.428 --> 1:09:42.759
Hey, watch it!

1:09:44.348 --> 1:09:47.840
- Go! Go now!
- Lady, I already have a customer.

1:09:47.934 --> 1:09:49.595
I said go.

1:09:50.020 --> 1:09:53.137
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Go now!

1:09:56.777 --> 1:10:00.736
Hey! Hey! Stop the cab!

1:10:20.967 --> 1:10:23.629
Thought you might like
a little something to eat or drink.

1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:26.962
Zach, Emma, then take the rest
to the people over there.

1:10:31.478 --> 1:10:32.684
Just drop 'em in here.

1:10:40.654 --> 1:10:42.064
What happened?

1:10:43.323 --> 1:10:44.824
They jumped us in the jungle.

1:10:45.992 --> 1:10:49.530
He took four of them out before
one of them hit him with a damn rock.

1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:57.372
You. Come with me.

1:10:59.089 --> 1:11:00.920
Come with you where?

1:11:13.186 --> 1:11:16.428
He wants to know what Jacob told you.

1:11:17.149 --> 1:11:21.688
He told me to come here,
said you guys would save Sayid.

1:11:25.282 --> 1:11:27.238
He was beyond saving.

1:11:28.076 --> 1:11:29.657
Wait a sec.

1:11:29.744 --> 1:11:32.030
You're not translating
anything I say to him,

1:11:32.122 --> 1:11:34.204
which means you totally
understand me, dude.

1:11:34.958 --> 1:11:38.041
I don't like the way
English tastes on my tongue.

1:11:41.465 --> 1:11:44.081
- When's Jacob getting here?
- What do you mean?

1:11:44.176 --> 1:11:45.336
Is he coming to the Temple?

1:11:46.386 --> 1:11:48.877
I really don't think
that's gonna happen, man.

1:11:49.931 --> 1:11:51.262
Why not?

1:11:51.349 --> 1:11:53.635
You know... 'cause he's dead.

1:11:57.772 --> 1:12:01.264
What? You guys didn't know?

1:12:09.618 --> 1:12:10.858
Everyone to your posts!

1:12:12.204 --> 1:12:13.990
On the walls! Prepare the ash!

1:12:25.926 --> 1:12:27.757
Ten men to the north side!

1:12:31.056 --> 1:12:32.387
Send the warning!

1:12:35.227 --> 1:12:36.592
Light it!

1:12:51.451 --> 1:12:53.157
Guess we're not getting out of here?

1:12:53.245 --> 1:12:56.453
This isn't to keep you in.
It's to keep him out.

1:12:56.540 --> 1:12:58.906
Him? Who?

1:13:12.764 --> 1:13:14.675
What are you?

1:13:15.475 --> 1:13:18.091
I'm not a "what," Ben. I'm a "who."

1:13:18.186 --> 1:13:20.268
You're the monster.

1:13:21.147 --> 1:13:23.524
Let's not resort to name-calling.

1:13:30.907 --> 1:13:32.647
You used me.

1:13:34.786 --> 1:13:39.655
You couldn't kill him yourself,
so you made me do it.

1:13:39.749 --> 1:13:42.786
I didn't make you do anything.

1:13:46.464 --> 1:13:47.749
You should know...

1:13:49.467 --> 1:13:51.719
...he was very confused
when you killed him.

1:13:51.803 --> 1:13:54.761
I seriously doubt
that Jacob was ever confused.

1:13:54.848 --> 1:13:56.839
I'm not talking about Jacob.

1:13:59.185 --> 1:14:01.267
I'm talking about John Locke.

1:14:03.648 --> 1:14:06.606
Do you wanna know
what he was thinking while you...

1:14:07.736 --> 1:14:10.148
...choked the life out of him, Benjamin?

1:14:10.238 --> 1:14:13.025
What the last thought
that ran through his head was?

1:14:14.534 --> 1:14:16.490
"I don't understand."

1:14:20.582 --> 1:14:23.289
Isn't that just the
saddest thing you ever heard?

1:14:26.004 --> 1:14:27.540
But it's fitting, in a way.

1:14:28.590 --> 1:14:33.459
Because when John first came
to the island, he was a very sad man.

1:14:34.137 --> 1:14:39.222
A victim shouting at the world
for being told what he couldn't do,

1:14:39.309 --> 1:14:40.799
even though they were right.

1:14:42.228 --> 1:14:47.564
He was weak and pathetic
and irreparably broken.

1:14:49.402 --> 1:14:54.863
But, despite all that, there was
something admirable about him.

1:14:54.949 --> 1:14:59.067
He was the only one of them
who didn't want to leave.

1:14:59.162 --> 1:15:01.244
The only one who realized

1:15:01.331 --> 1:15:06.371
how pitiful the life
he'd left behind actually was.

1:15:15.929 --> 1:15:17.715
What do you want?

1:15:19.265 --> 1:15:21.972
Well, that's the great irony here,
Ben, because...

1:15:22.936 --> 1:15:25.643
...I want the one thing
that John Locke didn't.

1:15:28.566 --> 1:15:31.774
I want to go home.

1:15:44.332 --> 1:15:45.993
Good-bye, dude.

1:15:47.001 --> 1:15:52.086
If you ever wanna talk, I'm around.

1:16:01.766 --> 1:16:02.755
What?

1:16:05.729 --> 1:16:07.139
Nothing.

1:16:21.911 --> 1:16:22.900
Hey.

1:16:25.999 --> 1:16:27.079
Where are we?

1:16:29.169 --> 1:16:33.663
- We're in a temple.
- We got caught by the Others again?

1:16:34.090 --> 1:16:39.881
Yeah. Only this time,
they're protecting us. I think.

1:16:41.973 --> 1:16:45.010
- Of course they are.
- You all right?

1:16:52.192 --> 1:16:53.978
I'm so sorry.

1:17:09.417 --> 1:17:11.658
You know what you said
back at the hatch?

1:17:12.587 --> 1:17:14.418
He's just trying to help us.

1:17:16.341 --> 1:17:18.297
I ain't gonna kill Jack.

1:17:21.805 --> 1:17:25.389
He deserves to suffer on this rock
just like the rest of us.

1:17:30.271 --> 1:17:32.432
Yeah.

1:17:32.524 --> 1:17:35.732
I know, and... Do you think
I knew this was gonna happen?

1:17:36.945 --> 1:17:40.187
l scheduled it so soon
because I want to get it over with.

1:17:43.034 --> 1:17:46.367
I don't know, Mom. He's not here,
so I can't tell you what to tell them,

1:17:46.454 --> 1:17:48.866
other then we can't
have the service without him.

1:17:50.250 --> 1:17:51.410
Yeah.

1:17:52.335 --> 1:17:54.451
I will call you if! hear anything.

1:17:57.549 --> 1:17:59.130
What did you lose?

1:18:00.510 --> 1:18:01.795
Excuse me?

1:18:01.886 --> 1:18:05.094
They lost one of my bags.
What about you?

1:18:07.225 --> 1:18:09.056
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

1:18:10.061 --> 1:18:11.676
Try me.

1:18:12.689 --> 1:18:14.429
They lost my father.

1:18:16.276 --> 1:18:17.607
I'm sorry?

1:18:17.694 --> 1:18:22.529
He died in Australia a couple days ago,
and I flew down to get him.

1:18:27.620 --> 1:18:29.406
My condolences.

1:18:30.832 --> 1:18:34.165
The coffin was supposed to go
on the plane in Sydney, but it didn't.

1:18:34.711 --> 1:18:37.373
He's somewhere in transit,
which is their way of saying

1:18:37.463 --> 1:18:39.670
they have no idea where the hell he is.

1:18:40.466 --> 1:18:42.252
Well, how could they know?

1:18:43.970 --> 1:18:47.428
They checked him in. They've gotta
have some kind of tracking system.

1:18:47.515 --> 1:18:51.258
No, I'm not talking about the coffin.
How could they know where he is?

1:18:53.730 --> 1:18:57.973
They didn't lose your father.
They just lost his body.

1:19:09.996 --> 1:19:12.783
Either way, your story
beats the hell out of mine.

1:19:12.874 --> 1:19:16.241
All that was in my suitcase
was a bunch of knives. Thanks.

1:19:16.336 --> 1:19:20.295
- You some kind of salesman?
- Yeah, somethin' like that.

1:19:22.884 --> 1:19:26.593
Well, it's nice talking to you.
I hope you find that coffin.

1:19:28.514 --> 1:19:30.766
- I hope you find your knives.
- Yeah, thanks.

1:19:31.351 --> 1:19:33.216
Mind if I ask what happened to you?

1:19:35.229 --> 1:19:38.767
I'm sorry. I'm only asking
because I'm a spinal surgeon.

1:19:38.858 --> 1:19:41.099
- I didn't mean to...
- Oh, no. Don't worry about it.

1:19:42.528 --> 1:19:44.610
Surgery isn't gonna
do anything to help me.

1:19:44.697 --> 1:19:46.528
My condition is irreversible.

1:19:47.909 --> 1:19:49.365
Nothing's irreversible.

1:19:59.003 --> 1:20:03.838
If you ever want a consult...
just give me a call.

1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:07.216
It's on the house.

1:20:08.221 --> 1:20:10.177
Well, thanks.

1:20:11.849 --> 1:20:15.262
"Jack Shephard."
l'm John. John Locke.

1:20:16.729 --> 1:20:19.562
- It's nice to meet you, John.
- Nice to meet you, too.

1:20:23.695 --> 1:20:25.185
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1:20:34.998 --> 1:20:36.579
What the hell is that?

1:20:59.439 --> 1:21:00.804
Don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!

1:21:03.735 --> 1:21:07.944
l'm seein' it,
but I'm still not believin' it.

1:21:12.535 --> 1:21:13.945
Hello, Richard.

1:21:15.288 --> 1:21:18.075
It's good to see you
out of those chains.

1:21:23.713 --> 1:21:25.669
- You?
- Me.

1:21:39.270 --> 1:21:43.639
I am very disappointed... in all of you.

1:22:28.027 --> 1:22:30.359
- You're Shephard?
- Yeah.

1:22:30.446 --> 1:22:32.152
We need to speak to you privately.

1:22:35.284 --> 1:22:37.616
If you've got something
to say to me, then say it.

1:22:37.703 --> 1:22:40.319
OthenNise, just leave me alone.

1:22:40.414 --> 1:22:43.952
I don't think you're understanding
me here. I'm asking politely.

1:22:44.836 --> 1:22:49.250
You either get up and come with us on
your own, or I'll have you dragged out.

1:22:51.884 --> 1:22:54.876
- and it's not going to be here.
- Is that right?

1:23:03.563 --> 1:23:04.973
Jack!

1:23:06.023 --> 1:23:07.433
Oh, my God.

1:23:18.744 --> 1:23:20.405
What happened?
