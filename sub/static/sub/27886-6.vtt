WEBVTT

00:09.300 --> 00:10.885
Look, man, I got to be honest with you.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.346
If I was inventing hell,
it would look a lot like this.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.264
Hell...

00:15.140 --> 00:16.850
Really? I think it's clean.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.477
No, not this place.
This, this whole situation.

00:19.561 --> 00:20.770
It's not that bad.

00:20.854 --> 00:26.026
I mean, our lives depend
on each other for, like, eternity?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.987
That's my own worst personal nightmare.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.074
Alan. Alan.

00:33.158 --> 00:33.992
Come on.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.911
No, man, it's-- it's not you.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.329
It's-- [sighs]

00:38.955 --> 00:41.249
I don't want to be attached to anyone.

00:42.375 --> 00:47.380
I want to just at least maintain
the illusion of free will, you know?

00:47.881 --> 00:50.133
Aah! Fuck! Fuck!

00:50.759 --> 00:52.927
[sighs] See, I didn't feel that.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.387
[groans]

00:54.471 --> 00:55.472
I'm sorry, man.

00:55.555 --> 00:59.184
I just had to be definitively sure that,
you know, we're not the same person.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.311
-I just wanted to rule it out.
-Well, we aren't.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.063
-Okay.
-I think you've already tried that.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.273
Right, right. You're right.

01:05.356 --> 01:08.401
Well, if it's not that,
then what else could it be?

01:10.987 --> 01:11.946
[Alan sighs]

01:12.864 --> 01:13.948
[Alan] Three sisters.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.494
No sisters. No siblings at all.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.662
-Are your parents alive?
-Yeah, you?

01:25.460 --> 01:27.170
What happened, irritable bowels?

01:28.421 --> 01:29.506
Oh, wow.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.966
You starting a cleaning supply company?

01:32.759 --> 01:33.843
Well, you...

01:33.927 --> 01:36.137
you got some ash on the table.

01:36.221 --> 01:39.224
Man, take a chill pill, okay?
It'll reset when we die.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.271
Hey, hey, could you not
touch my stuff, please?

01:46.147 --> 01:48.358
-I have it organized...
-Uh-uh. Fucking A.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.651
...in a very specific way.

01:49.734 --> 01:50.860
Man, you play this?

01:51.444 --> 01:53.571
No, not since it came out.
It is the worst.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.824
You know, this is one of the first games
I helped design.

01:55.907 --> 01:59.536
Well, that's something we have in common.
You designed it. I played it.

01:59.619 --> 02:03.123
Yeah, you and every other dude
between the ages of 18 and 35.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.209
-Why do you think this sucks?
-It is impossible.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.419
I spent six months trying
to get out of the snake room

02:08.503 --> 02:11.339
before I realized whoever designed this
probably didn't bother to play it.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.967
-Let me tell you something. You? You?
-Yeah?

02:14.050 --> 02:15.510
You don't think I played my own game?

02:15.593 --> 02:18.012
Uh... I'd bet my life on it.

02:18.721 --> 02:23.518
Well, that does not mean much
given our present circumstances.

02:23.601 --> 02:27.105
You created an impossible game
with a single character

02:27.188 --> 02:29.649
who has to solve everything
entirely on her own.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.317
That's stupid.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.361
Watch and learn, baby face.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.904
[video game chimes]

02:35.864 --> 02:37.991
[Nadia] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

02:38.074 --> 02:38.950
There you go.

02:39.701 --> 02:40.910
You little bitch.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.413
I say...

02:43.913 --> 02:46.833
the trick is
you got to find a labyrinth keeper.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.670
You know, she's based on Tatum O'Neal
in <i>Paper Moon,</i> but with my hairdo.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.839
They call that an Easter egg.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.007
Be careful.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.301
[character screams]

02:56.384 --> 02:59.762
[Nadia] <i>Mea culpa, </i>this shit
is fucking harder than I remember.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.347
Do you mind smoking outside?

03:01.431 --> 03:04.893
Look, if I smoke outside,
then I could die.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.437
And if I die, you die.
So basically, you're welcome, all right?

03:07.520 --> 03:09.189
Don't be so fucking uptight, man.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.649
-Hey, how did you die?
-[Alan] Oh.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.902
Um... [sighs]

03:13.985 --> 03:16.029
-Crushed in rush hour traffic.
-Uh-huh.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.740
Slipped in the shower.
Uh, bathtub electrocution.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.658
Um...

03:20.742 --> 03:21.701
Open manhole.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.746
Right, but, you know, the first time?
How did you die that first time?

03:25.872 --> 03:27.290
I don't know. I can't remember.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.792
What do you mean you can't remember?
I remember my first time.

03:29.876 --> 03:30.877
I was hit by a car.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.129
Honestly, all I remember
is suddenly being in my bathroom

03:33.213 --> 03:35.256
and then just reliving the same day.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.425
You don't remember your first death?

03:37.508 --> 03:38.551
Mm-mm.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.929
[video game character screams]

03:41.012 --> 03:41.888
[Nadia scoffs]

03:42.555 --> 03:46.017
Look, your first death could be
what started this whole thing.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.060
Why?

03:47.143 --> 03:48.853
I mean, maybe it's not, but...

03:49.354 --> 03:51.898
honestly, it's the only unknown factor
that we have.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.524
Johari window.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.485
You know, it's a known unknown.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.111
We got to trigger your memory.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.196
W-- Wait, how?

03:58.696 --> 04:02.408
You see, lucky for you,
I know a professional.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.495
Darling, that is not how I work.

04:06.287 --> 04:11.000
I see patients regularly for years
before even trying EMDR.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.836
Right, right. Uh... hypnosis.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.382
Or, um... I don't know, ayahuasca?

04:17.465 --> 04:18.508
[Ruth] Listen to me.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.885
I'm a therapist, not a shaman.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.179
Would either one of you like some tea?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.973
[Nadia] No, no, no tea.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.849
Ruth, you have a gas leak.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.394
Okay? I will call it in
while you're in session.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.729
-Please don't roll your eyes at me.
-No. No. No, no, no.

04:31.813 --> 04:32.730
I... No.

04:33.231 --> 04:37.151
I don't need to go to see a therapist.
No offense to you, but I...

04:37.235 --> 04:39.529
People thinking that I'm crazy
is one of my biggest fears.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.864
-That's fine.
-No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

04:41.948 --> 04:45.285
We do not use the word "crazy"
in this house.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.289
Look, has Nadia ever told you
about her mother?

04:49.372 --> 04:51.249
Ah, here it comes.

04:51.332 --> 04:54.335
Nadia's mother was a brilliant woman,

04:54.419 --> 04:56.379
-just like Nadia.
-Eye roll.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.632
But she would get fixated
on little things, and...

05:00.341 --> 05:05.638
She'd read somewhere that purple is
the color of the seventh chakra healing,

05:05.722 --> 05:09.183
so naturally, she wore nothing but purple
for an entire year.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.020
And, oh... the mirrors.

05:12.645 --> 05:16.024
Don't get me started on the mirrors.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.485
One day, she shattered them.

05:19.569 --> 05:23.740
And when I came to take Nadia to school,
well, the mirrors were gone

05:23.823 --> 05:26.659
and there was glass everywhere.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.995
I think
there were some shards in your hair.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.246
And that's a wrap.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.083
-It wasn't that bad.
-It was that bad.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.502
-I was there.
-So was I.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.046
Why-- Why mirrors?

05:38.129 --> 05:39.213
Reflection.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.883
Proof of existence.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.677
Another pair of eyes.

05:45.386 --> 05:48.222
See, that's why therapists are important.

05:48.306 --> 05:54.187
Without them, we are very unreliable
narrators of our own stories.

05:55.730 --> 05:56.564
Okay.

05:57.648 --> 06:00.985
Okay, I-- I-- I will...
I'll give it a try, just this once.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.658
Okay, I was wrong. I accept it,
but we got to figure out how you died.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.495
I told you that wouldn't work,
and therapy is one of my biggest fears.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.705
It's like if you said
that you were afraid of spiders
and then I was like,
"Here's a bunch of spiders."

06:14.999 --> 06:17.668
Ruth isn't a spider. She's got more
of a praying mantis vibe,

06:17.752 --> 06:19.837
which, as somebody
who's always been allergic to bees,

06:19.921 --> 06:21.339
I find highly comforting.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.216
That's weird. I'm allergic to bees, too.

06:23.299 --> 06:27.428
Seriously? Oh, so I guess we run
into a bunch of fucking honeybees now.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.348
[screaming indistinctly]

06:31.849 --> 06:33.309
[buzzing]

06:36.437 --> 06:37.563
[knock on door]

06:41.943 --> 06:43.361
[knocking on door]

06:46.489 --> 06:47.323
[opens door]

06:47.407 --> 06:50.576
Okay, new plan. Hear me out.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.871
What if I go through your night with you?

06:53.955 --> 06:58.209
We recreate what you did that first time.
Maybe I see something that you didn't.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.044
Look, you don't understand.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.797
You get to relive
your fancy birthday party with...

07:03.840 --> 07:05.842
awesome people that you don't even like.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.846
And I have to relive
the worst night of my life.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.348
I don't want you to see it.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.059
Alan, I have seen some shit.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.728
Okay? Whatever happened that night...

07:18.521 --> 07:20.857
you're not gonna surprise me, I promise.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.817
[Alan sighs]

07:24.610 --> 07:26.070
-Come on.
-[Alan sighs]

07:27.238 --> 07:28.781
All right, what did you do first?

07:30.408 --> 07:31.993
The first time I lived this cycle,

07:32.076 --> 07:35.246
I didn't know she was on the phone
before I went in, so... so, um...

07:36.122 --> 07:37.748
we should wait until she's done.

07:38.374 --> 07:41.586
[Beatrice] I just hope
he is not planning to propose.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.589
I was planning on proposing
on the original night.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.048
I-- I didn't hear any of this.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.177
[Beatrice] I spent months trying to get
through to him, but he doesn't seem...

07:49.260 --> 07:50.970
She's talking to that guy named Mike.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.640
The one she cheated on me with? The one
who was at your party? The douchebag?

07:54.724 --> 07:57.518
-A pseudo-intellectual white guy?
-[Beatrice] I have to tell him tonight.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.146
-That's Maxine's friend.
-[Beatrice] Okay, bye.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.315
[Alan sighs]

08:06.694 --> 08:07.528
[Nadia] Huh.

08:09.113 --> 08:12.200
Huh. So this is the famous Beatrice.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.285
Alan. Who's this?

08:15.244 --> 08:16.412
Ah. Uh...

08:16.496 --> 08:18.706
I'm... We just ran into each other
on the street.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.833
I gotta take a leak. Is that okay?

08:21.834 --> 08:24.337
-Sure.
-[Nadia] Thank you. Tiny bladder.

08:24.962 --> 08:25.796
[door closes]

08:25.880 --> 08:28.341
Oh. Uh, real quick.
Do you have any cottage cheese?

08:28.424 --> 08:30.301
Who eats cottage cheese?

08:30.384 --> 08:32.720
Look, it's how I maintain my figure,
all right?

08:33.638 --> 08:35.890
-The bathroom's over there.
-Thank you.

08:40.019 --> 08:40.937
Who the hell is that?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.855
It's a long story.

08:42.939 --> 08:46.275
-She's helping me out with something.
-[Beatrice] I thought we were going away.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.445
You and I both know that's not
gonna happen, so let's get this over with.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.787
Look, I know
we're supposed to leave tonight,

08:58.371 --> 09:00.748
but I've just been thinking a lot
about our relationship.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.959
We've been together
since we were kids and...

09:03.543 --> 09:05.670
basically, you're like my best friend.

09:05.753 --> 09:09.549
But if I'm honest with myself...
this isn't what I want.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.884
I want more for my life.

09:12.468 --> 09:15.263
I want to make mistakes.
I want to get my degree.

09:15.346 --> 09:18.849
There's so much I want to do, and you
just want to stay exactly the same.

09:20.601 --> 09:21.852
I love you, but...

09:21.936 --> 09:22.812
[sighs]

09:22.895 --> 09:27.650
...I've been taking care of this, us, you,
for the last nine years, and...

09:28.359 --> 09:31.612
I just can't help but realize
that I've been worrying about you...

09:32.113 --> 09:34.574
and managing us,
and it's just becoming a job.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.743
And I already have a full-time job.

09:37.827 --> 09:38.911
Oh, you have a job?

09:40.246 --> 09:41.080
Yeah.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.041
I'm working on my PhD in literature.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.419
Wow, that is totally useless.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.046
I'm so sorry. I actually--
I just came over

09:49.130 --> 09:54.260
because I wanted to tell you that
these gluten-free crackers are dynamite.

09:54.343 --> 09:55.845
Who do you think you are?

09:55.928 --> 09:59.724
I think I get the picture.
So you think you can do better.

10:00.308 --> 10:04.020
It's interesting, 'cause I actually think
that Alan over here

10:04.103 --> 10:05.646
is way out of your league.
No one asked you, okay?

10:07.356 --> 10:09.275
Where-- Where'd you get this art from?

10:09.358 --> 10:12.820
Is it, like, all from Urban Outfitters
or just a couple of the pieces?

10:12.903 --> 10:13.821
[Alan chuckles]

10:15.948 --> 10:17.074
Who is this woman?

10:17.158 --> 10:18.200
Are we done here?

10:20.703 --> 10:21.621
[Alan chuckles]

10:22.455 --> 10:24.373
[Nadia] All right, great, man. Come on.

10:25.374 --> 10:26.917
[Nadia] Yeah. Yeah.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.629
All right, keep the crackers.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.796
This guy right here

10:30.880 --> 10:33.799
can maintain erections
like few men I've known, all right?

10:33.883 --> 10:37.178
And you're gonna miss out on all that,
so meditate on that.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.346
[crunches]

10:41.849 --> 10:42.683
[door closes]

10:45.227 --> 10:46.312
Stupid.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.647
-[door opens]
-[Alan] Oh.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.150
I know she's not gonna remember
any of that, but that was so great.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.277
It was great. You were amazing. Thank you.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.196
You know what?
I really was fucking amazing.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.698
I gotta tell you, man.
I never stick my neck out for anybody,

10:57.782 --> 11:00.368
but I feel like fucking Rocky right now.

11:00.451 --> 11:03.704
Hey, 'cause the thing is
it's so great every time.

11:03.788 --> 11:04.914
This little bitch fucked you,

11:04.997 --> 11:06.957
and this time, you went in there
and fucked her.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.085
Yeah. Yeah, thank you. Thank you.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.086
You're welcome.

11:10.711 --> 11:11.712
You're welcome.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.091
All right, so, what happened next?

11:15.758 --> 11:16.759
[Alan] Oh.
[dance music playing]

11:17.927 --> 11:18.844
[sighs]

11:23.641 --> 11:25.726
So, is this about as drunk as you were?

11:25.810 --> 11:29.772
I was way more drunk.
I don't even remember how drunk I was.

11:29.855 --> 11:30.731
Oh, I get it.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.067
Uh, hey, bartendress.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.820
-Hello. Uh, more drunk, please.
-[woman] Here you go.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.446
-Yes, thanks. Great.
-Yeah.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.122
I knew she was unhappy.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.126
I don't know why I thought proposing
would be a good idea.

11:50.209 --> 11:54.130
Sometimes Hail Marys
are the best Marys we've got.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.382
You ever been married, engaged?

11:56.465 --> 11:58.551
You know, I've thought about it,
I've thought about it,

11:58.634 --> 12:01.429
but then I realize
that's just a base instinct

12:01.512 --> 12:04.223
mostly for suckers
and, you know, mediocres.

12:04.306 --> 12:08.102
And so, I move on. I get over it.
I mean, I don't really think it's for me.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.395
I think I'm meant to be alone.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.356
Not many people could go through
what we are going through.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.315
Mm-mm.

12:15.776 --> 12:16.777
That's pretty.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.363
Oh, this. This was my mother's.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.825
It's a krugerrand. You know what that is?

12:22.908 --> 12:25.035
May-- No. No, I definitely don't.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.038
It's a South African gold bullion.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.166
It goes for about $1,500 an ounce.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.751
Whoa. Cool.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.253
I told you my grandparents
are Holocaust survivors, right?

12:34.336 --> 12:36.797
No, we basically just met.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.007
I'm sorry about--

12:38.090 --> 12:39.133
It's not on you.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.177
Anyway, after the war, you know,

12:41.260 --> 12:44.430
most survivors were a little bit paranoid
about putting their money in banks,

12:44.513 --> 12:47.224
so my grandparents acquired
150 of these babies,

12:47.308 --> 12:50.352
and then my mother,
'cause she's a fucking piece of work,

12:50.436 --> 12:52.188
she spent them all except for this one.

12:52.772 --> 12:53.981
How much is 150--

12:54.565 --> 12:57.026
You know,
the price of gold fluctuates, but, uh...

12:58.027 --> 12:59.028
if I had to guess,

12:59.111 --> 13:02.239
$152,780.86.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.158
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

13:04.241 --> 13:07.787
I know this, because why?
Because it was my fucking college fund.

13:07.870 --> 13:11.916
But hey, I got
a pretty necklace, right? So...

13:15.586 --> 13:18.047
-Your mom, she-- she sounds--
-[Nadia] Great.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.508
Uh, so, what happened after this?

13:20.591 --> 13:21.967
Um... [exhales]

13:22.051 --> 13:24.720
Um, I'm trying... It's hazy. Um...

13:26.847 --> 13:30.768
You know what, man? Don't work too hard.
I mean, it's only eternity.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.645
Hey.

13:32.728 --> 13:34.271
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.191
Why-- Why am I the only one
who's being interrogated?

13:37.274 --> 13:39.944
You're involved in this shit too,
so it's whatever.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.570
Midnight? Where were you at this time?

13:42.363 --> 13:43.864
I was taking care of business.
[Nadia clears her throat]

13:47.535 --> 13:49.703
Look, you promise
you're not gonna flip out?

13:49.787 --> 13:50.621
Yeah.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.417
I was fucking Mike from the party.

13:56.043 --> 13:56.961
[Nadia groans]

13:57.503 --> 13:58.546
Beatrice Mike?

13:59.755 --> 14:01.298
[Nadia] Yeah. What are the odds, right?

14:01.382 --> 14:04.385
I mean, like, she's cheating on you,
he's cheating on her.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.179
Ipso facto,
it's like we all fucked Beatrice.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.597
I mean, you the most, of course,

14:08.681 --> 14:12.434
but, you know, in a kind of fun
gang-bang way, it's like a mash-em-up.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.187
-You fucked Mike from the party?
-Oh, here we go.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.355
Okay.

14:16.438 --> 14:17.523
You-- You know what?

14:17.606 --> 14:19.483
You know what?
This is not about my first death.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.111
This is probably because
you were fucking that Irish--

14:22.194 --> 14:25.781
that Irish fucking gingerbread
fisherman-looking motherfucker.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.782
All right, man.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.994
First of all, I mean,
this guy's hands are so fucking soft,

14:30.077 --> 14:32.705
there's no way he's done
a day's worth of hard labor in his life,

14:32.788 --> 14:34.999
let alone that, you know,
hardcore fishing.

14:35.082 --> 14:38.335
And second of all, the sex was,
I want to say, mediocre at best.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.380
Like medium, you know?
And there's no way that it set off

14:41.463 --> 14:44.341
a whole world-bending multiverse

14:44.425 --> 14:47.094
wonderland fucking splitting-level shit,
all right?

14:48.679 --> 14:49.722
[Alan groans]

14:50.639 --> 14:53.017
Let's slow down.
Bukowski's not your greatest look.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.979
I can fuck you better than Mike.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.736
Wow. It looks like someone just threw
a gauntlet right into my puss-puss.

15:05.988 --> 15:06.864
Let's have at it.

15:10.993 --> 15:14.246
-[Nadia] That's right.
-You want to see how a gingerman fucks?

15:14.330 --> 15:15.915
-Fuck yes, I do.
-[Alan] Uh-huh.

15:16.707 --> 15:17.833
[both moan]

15:17.917 --> 15:19.126
Call me Beatrice.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.336
Beatrice.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.504
Hey, I'm cheating on you.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.506
All right, but you're gonna
fuck me anyway.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.966
Then you're gonna marry me.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.802
I'd fuck anything, huh.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.096
I'd fuck fucking...

15:31.889 --> 15:32.973
pizza.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.558
-Where'd you go?
-Pizza and all.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.853
-Come on, role play. Don't pass out.
-I'm Mike. Yeah, I'm Mike.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.648
I'm fat Mike. I'm gonna fuck it right.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.441
-Okay.
-Uh-huh.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.485
Yeah, you... You wanna...
You wanna just...

15:44.568 --> 15:46.445
-You wanna just fuck right now?
-Yes.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.155
[Alan grunts]

15:48.238 --> 15:49.073
Yeah.

15:49.156 --> 15:49.990
[Alan growls]

16:21.146 --> 16:22.231
Fucking rats.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.276
Hey. Hey, Horse.

16:27.611 --> 16:28.487
Hey, man.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.239
Uh...

16:30.322 --> 16:31.657
Uh, Nadia. Yeah.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.868
It's me. I'm your friend.
You gave me a haircut.

16:35.619 --> 16:36.578
I don't know you.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.208
All right, be cool, man.
Look, look, look, what size are you?

16:41.709 --> 16:42.584
What do you mean?

16:47.339 --> 16:48.340
Come with me.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.217
All right.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.970
Where the fuck are we going?

16:54.096 --> 16:55.305
I got plants.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.978
I prefer casual acquaintances
over closer relations

17:01.061 --> 17:04.815
and strangers above everybody else,
'cause humanity's a fuck, man.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.526
I had this business partner once
in the '90s

17:07.609 --> 17:09.361
when we were creating the dark web.

17:10.237 --> 17:14.450
And he got arrested because it was a scam
and our government is a scam.

17:14.533 --> 17:18.954
And once I saw it was all just bullshit,
I just dropped out completely.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.500
How do you know that you're real?

17:24.001 --> 17:24.877
Huh?

17:27.337 --> 17:31.050
Do you think that we need people
to be, like, witnesses?

17:31.925 --> 17:33.052
I'm here.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.512
That's where you know.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.768
I'm glad I lost everything.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.856
Technology, cryptocurrencies...

17:48.067 --> 17:49.693
It's all bullshit, man.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.487
You don't need any of that stuff.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.786
The more stuff you accumulate...

18:00.871 --> 18:02.372
the more space you take up.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.167
You know, people can't even pick me
out of a line up 'cause...

18:05.793 --> 18:07.002
they don't remember me.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.296
I'm a shadow, man.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.258
I think I'm a shadow now, too.

18:33.987 --> 18:34.905
Is that real gold?
Why?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.244
It's too heavy.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.130
Next time, get a plastic bag.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.732
[keyboard keys clacking]

19:14.319 --> 19:15.404
-Hey.
-Hi

19:16.446 --> 19:18.031
How's the, uh, novel coming?

19:18.657 --> 19:22.536
Ugh, I-- I can't do dialogue. It makes me
feel like I don't know how people talk.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.621
I think it's one of those things
like swallowing.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.790
Like, if you think about it,
you can't do it anymore.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.834
Like now I'm thinking about it
and I can't swallow.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.961
-[Ferran] Huh.
-[objects clatter]

19:48.353 --> 19:50.564
You know Alan. He was here that night.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.901
-What night?
-Alan Zaveri, how do you know him?

19:53.984 --> 19:55.235
[Ferran] We're good friends.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.237
We worked at a cannery together in Alaska.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.197
Wait, what?

19:58.280 --> 20:00.908
Nah, I'm just kidding. We actually pledged
Alpha Delta in college.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.286
That cannery thing though,
it's pretty good. I put in my novel.

20:05.787 --> 20:06.622
[sighs]

20:06.705 --> 20:08.874
As for my friend, keep the change.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.127
-Thanks, Ferran.
-[Ferran] Yeah, have a good night.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.046
[doorbell chimes]

20:16.715 --> 20:19.343
Hey, Alan. Guess what, man?

20:19.426 --> 20:20.260
[door closes]

20:20.344 --> 20:22.721
We saw each other
on the night of our first loop.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.057
Where were you?

20:25.766 --> 20:28.810
I did not realize
that Howard Hughes was gonna show up.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.439
You went through my stuff?

20:33.023 --> 20:35.609
I didn't know where you were
and I couldn't find my shoes.

20:36.318 --> 20:40.364
I started to look for them and then...
I just got away with myself.

20:40.447 --> 20:42.991
-So then you went through my stuff?
-I cleaned.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.326
Cleaned?

20:49.831 --> 20:51.583
I-- I found those under your bed.

20:56.546 --> 20:59.508
Did it occur to you
that these were under my fucking bed...

21:00.342 --> 21:03.011
because I wanted them
under my fucking bed?

21:04.012 --> 21:06.223
Well, it will all reset like you said.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.767
It will all just go back
to the way you had it.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.728
Fuck you for going through my shit.
Fuck you for touching these.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.231
Fuck you for being a fuck face.
Get the fuck out.

21:14.314 --> 21:17.192
Nadia, I'm sorry. We-- we need each other.
I need you. You need me.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.360
Did I stutter?

21:18.443 --> 21:19.569
Uh...

21:28.078 --> 21:31.123
-I don't have any shoes, Nadia.
-Oh, my God, get the fuck out!

21:31.206 --> 21:34.209
-I'm sorry.
-Just get out of my fucking house, dude!

21:38.213 --> 21:39.756
[video game sounds]

21:52.728 --> 21:53.729
[character screams]

21:53.812 --> 21:54.938
God!

21:57.107 --> 21:58.400
[classical music playing]

22:00.736 --> 22:01.695
[sighs]

22:46.114 --> 22:48.367
Looking at these old pictures
of me and Mom...

22:49.034 --> 22:50.702
it just fucked me up, Ruth.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.997
Remember when she was trying
to get the Betty Boop trademark,

22:54.081 --> 22:56.166
she had the licensing company.

22:56.249 --> 23:01.004
There was all these Betty Boop towels,
Betty Boop clocks, Betty Boop watches.

23:01.546 --> 23:04.466
-What the fuck was that?
-Darling, you have to forgive her.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.303
Look, don't you want
to move on with your life?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.097
You know what, Ruth? Seriously...

23:10.180 --> 23:13.225
[mumbles indistinctly]

23:13.308 --> 23:15.977
Humanity... a little bit overrated, no?

23:16.061 --> 23:18.021
We need other people.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.898
Other people are garbage.

23:20.524 --> 23:21.525
[Ruth sighs]

23:22.526 --> 23:24.653
-Then forgive them.
-Oh, God.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.655
That's what I do with you.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.158
Just... try it sometime.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.495
Yeah, yeah, yeah. <i>Chag sameach.</i>

23:34.621 --> 23:36.790
You have a gas leak.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.459
[Nadia] Fucking no meat on these.

23:39.543 --> 23:40.710
[jazz music playing]

23:49.136 --> 23:51.805
[choking]

23:51.888 --> 23:52.722
Throat.
Throat.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.936

24:16.746 --> 24:19.249
-Sweet birthday baby, having fun?
-Where'd it go?
