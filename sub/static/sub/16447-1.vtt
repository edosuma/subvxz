The Big Bang Theory...</i>

00:02.190 --> 00:04.002
Dad,
this is Sheldon's mother, Mary.

00:04.188 --> 00:04.884
How do you do?

00:04.885 --> 00:06.101
Nice to meet you.

00:06.103 --> 00:07.135
And, of course, Mom.

00:07.137 --> 00:09.304
Hello, my hateful shrew.

00:09.306 --> 00:12.891
Hello to you,
you wrinkled old bastard.

00:15.062 --> 00:16.227
Hey.

00:16.229 --> 00:19.030
Just got an e-mail
from the U.S. Air Force.

00:19.032 --> 00:23.118
I'm just afraid if I respond,
then they'll know I got it.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.620
Dude, the minute you opened that
e-mail, they knew you got it.

00:25.622 --> 00:26.538
I mean, they're probably
looking at you

00:26.540 --> 00:29.491
through the camera
right now.

00:29.493 --> 00:31.242
Oh, God.

00:31.244 --> 00:33.461
I think someone's
following us.

00:34.831 --> 00:37.132
Uh, turn left here
and see if he turns with us.

00:37.134 --> 00:39.167
Why is he turning here?
The restaurant's the other way.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.336
I don't know.
He uses that traffic app.

00:41.338 --> 00:42.670
Maybe there's an accident.

00:42.672 --> 00:44.255
Oh, so follow him.

00:44.257 --> 00:47.142
Oh, no!

00:47.978 --> 00:49.060
Leonard, if you don't mind,

00:49.062 --> 00:50.311
I think I'm a little tired.

00:50.313 --> 00:51.396
I'm gonna call it a night.

00:51.398 --> 00:52.597
Sure, Dad.

00:52.599 --> 00:54.349
I'm a little
tuckered out myself.

00:54.351 --> 00:57.569
Well, I will see you
all in the morning.

00:57.571 --> 00:59.020
Would you like to share a cab?

00:59.022 --> 01:00.105
That would be fine.

01:00.107 --> 01:01.856
Where are you staying?
I'm at the Westin.

01:01.858 --> 01:02.941
Well, so am I.

01:02.943 --> 01:04.325
Could I interest
you in a nightcap?

01:04.327 --> 01:06.194
I think that you could.

01:10.867 --> 01:14.202
Leonard?

01:14.204 --> 01:16.538
Leonard?

01:16.540 --> 01:17.755
What?

01:17.757 --> 01:21.092
You realize you and I
could become brothers.

01:21.962 --> 01:23.878
We're not gonna be brothers.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.346
We're not gonna be stepbrothers.

01:25.348 --> 01:26.881
Go to sleep.

01:26.883 --> 01:28.883
I hope you're right.

01:28.885 --> 01:30.718
'Cause a grown man
living with his brother

01:30.720 --> 01:33.972
and his brother's wife is weird.

01:33.974 --> 01:36.307
Go to sleep.

01:36.309 --> 01:38.476
Okay.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.148
Do you think your father's
doing unspeakable things

01:43.150 --> 01:45.900
to my mother?

01:45.902 --> 01:47.068
No.

01:47.070 --> 01:48.403
Are you saying that

01:48.405 --> 01:50.622
because the things
are unspeakable?

01:50.624 --> 01:51.823
Your parents are old.

01:51.825 --> 01:53.825
Anything unspeakable
was finished by 9:30.

01:53.827 --> 01:55.043
Go to sleep.

01:55.879 --> 01:58.079
Very well.

01:59.916 --> 02:03.635
I'm sorry if this stuff is gonna
make the ceremony awkward.

02:03.637 --> 02:05.386
God, I thought my brother
fresh out of jail

02:05.388 --> 02:07.148
was gonna make everyone
uncomfortable, but now this...

02:07.172 --> 02:07.840
Hey, if you want me to sleep

02:07.841 --> 02:10.642
you're gonna
have to stop talking.

my family.

02:41.197 --> 02:43.614
Like an hour and half,
two hours, depending on traffic.

02:43.616 --> 02:44.782
Yeah, drive safe.
Oh, hey,

02:44.784 --> 02:46.050
and do yourself a favor,
all right?

02:46.052 --> 02:49.186
When Beverly gets here,
do not bring up last night.

02:49.188 --> 02:50.287
All right?
As far as you're concerned,

02:50.289 --> 02:52.489
you don't know anything,

02:52.491 --> 02:53.507
you didn't see anything.

02:53.509 --> 02:57.962
I want you just to play dumb.

02:57.964 --> 03:01.015
It was nice of her to show us
playing dumb with an example.

03:01.017 --> 03:02.433
What?

03:02.435 --> 03:04.134
Oh.

03:04.136 --> 03:06.303
Hi. Okay, hey there, I got--
I'm sorry, I got to go now.

03:06.305 --> 03:09.223
Penny, wait.
Why?

03:09.225 --> 03:12.109
I wanted to thank you for
going through all the trouble

03:12.111 --> 03:15.362
of planning a second wedding
ceremony for me,

03:15.364 --> 03:17.531
but unfortunately
I cannot attend.

03:17.533 --> 03:19.650
Well, why?
What's wrong?

03:19.652 --> 03:21.285
Wha-- are we still doing
the dumb thing?

03:21.287 --> 03:23.370
Okay, why, what's wrong?

03:23.372 --> 03:25.539
I just cannot stay here
while your father

03:25.541 --> 03:27.741
goes out of his way
to humiliate me.

03:27.743 --> 03:30.878
Oh, golly, however
did he humiliate you?

03:30.880 --> 03:32.496
Stop it, Sheldon.

03:32.498 --> 03:36.000
Do I say "Stop what?"
or just throw in the towel?

03:36.002 --> 03:38.218
I don't see why I should
have to watch your father

03:38.220 --> 03:41.422
parade around with some
Bible-thumping bumpkin.

03:41.424 --> 03:43.807
Oh, excuse me, that is my mother
you're talking about,

03:43.809 --> 03:46.010
however accurately.

03:46.012 --> 03:47.511
Okay, Beverly,

03:47.513 --> 03:48.679
aren't you overreacting
a little?

03:48.681 --> 03:50.848
All we know is they shared
a cab and had a nightcap.

03:50.850 --> 03:52.066
And turned their phones off.

03:52.068 --> 03:55.352
Not helping, buddy.

03:55.354 --> 03:57.821
Mother, Penny and I really want
you to be part of this.

03:57.823 --> 03:58.939
Please stay.

03:58.941 --> 03:59.907
Yeah, plus if you leave,

03:59.909 --> 04:01.859
Alfred will know
he got under your skin.

04:05.331 --> 04:07.364
Well, we can't have that.

04:08.751 --> 04:10.250
You know, also,
if they did have coitus,

04:10.252 --> 04:12.453
we'll all be needing
a skilled psychiatrist.

04:15.758 --> 04:18.208
It is funny
when you think about it.

04:18.209 --> 04:19.259
Maybe to you.

04:19.261 --> 04:21.428
You didn't get
a $500 traffic ticket.

04:21.430 --> 04:24.765
Because you were driving
like a lunatic.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.550
Hey, if thinking
secret government agents

04:26.552 --> 04:30.721
are chasing you makes you
a lunatic, then... yeah, okay.

04:32.808 --> 04:35.859
Oh, I'll get it.

04:35.861 --> 04:37.561
It didn't help that you couldn't
walk a straight line

04:37.563 --> 04:39.730
when the cop pulled you over.

04:39.732 --> 04:43.400
I have performance anxiety.

04:44.487 --> 04:47.488
You of all people
should know that.

04:57.249 --> 04:59.416
Hello.

04:59.418 --> 05:01.168
I'm looking for Howard Wolowitz.

05:01.170 --> 05:05.255
Howard Wolowitz?

05:05.257 --> 05:07.474
I have the right address,
don't I?

05:07.476 --> 05:10.260
Address?

05:10.262 --> 05:11.895
Is he here?

05:11.897 --> 05:15.599
Um... no.

05:15.601 --> 05:17.651
Do you know where
I can find him?

05:17.653 --> 05:19.987
May I ask what this is about?

05:19.989 --> 05:21.438
No, you may not.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.823
Very well.

05:27.246 --> 05:29.113
Have him call me.

05:29.115 --> 05:30.330
Okay.

05:30.332 --> 05:32.616
Raj, who's at the door?

05:36.288 --> 05:39.289
That's not him.

05:40.459 --> 05:42.843
Oh, I can't wait for
you to meet everyone.

05:42.845 --> 05:44.628
I told them all about you.

05:44.630 --> 05:46.130
Like what?

05:46.132 --> 05:47.464
Do they know about your brother?

05:47.466 --> 05:51.385
Uh, not everything, just,
like, the jail and drugs part.

05:51.387 --> 05:53.437
Why would you do that?

05:53.439 --> 05:54.805
What?
The world doesn't need

05:54.807 --> 05:56.140
to know our problems.

05:56.142 --> 05:57.141
Well, Mom, I'm sorry, but...

05:57.143 --> 05:59.860
Hey, look, they got
Walgreens here, too.

06:01.147 --> 06:04.031
You really think it's helpful
to change the subject, Wyatt?

06:04.033 --> 06:06.316
Just trying to make this
a happy trip, dear.

06:06.318 --> 06:08.152
Well, quit it!

06:10.289 --> 06:12.489
So, uh, Randall,
can't believe

06:12.491 --> 06:13.957
after all these years
you finally get to visit me

06:13.959 --> 06:15.292
in California.

06:15.294 --> 06:17.211
Well, good thing I was
a nonviolent offender,

06:17.213 --> 06:19.246
otherwise I couldn't
have left the state.

06:19.248 --> 06:23.167
All right,
that's enough jail talk.

06:23.169 --> 06:26.220
Penny knows where I was;
she sent me cigarettes.

06:26.222 --> 06:28.922
You sent
your brother cigarettes?

06:28.924 --> 06:30.674
He was cooking and selling
crystal meth, Susan,

06:30.676 --> 06:33.844
I think we can
let the cigarettes slide.

06:33.846 --> 06:35.596
Stop trying to be
the cool dad;

06:35.598 --> 06:39.433
you have a shirt
with our cat's picture on it.

06:39.435 --> 06:41.902
Anyway, we're here, slugger.

06:44.690 --> 06:47.574
That's great, now they
know where I live.

06:47.576 --> 06:48.826
What are you talking about?

06:48.828 --> 06:50.360
They've always known
where you live.

06:50.362 --> 06:51.528
Yeah, if you want to go
off the grid,

06:51.530 --> 06:53.250
you have to move out
of your mother's house.

06:55.084 --> 06:57.251
Can we take a moment
to discuss

06:57.253 --> 06:59.419
that I just lied
to the government for you?

06:59.421 --> 07:00.537
Yeah.

07:00.539 --> 07:02.706
I would not have
done that for you.

07:03.843 --> 07:06.677
Howard, please just call
the man, see what he wants.

07:06.679 --> 07:08.595
All right, all right.

07:08.597 --> 07:10.047
Hey,

07:10.049 --> 07:12.099
make sure you tell him that
you weren't home when he came by

07:12.101 --> 07:14.101
and that your Indian friend
gave you the message

07:14.103 --> 07:16.770
the moment
you stepped through the door.

07:16.772 --> 07:20.390
Yes, hello.
Uh,

07:20.392 --> 07:23.477
this is Howard Wolowitz
for Colonel Richard Williams.

07:23.479 --> 07:25.145
Oh, I take it back,
don't mention me.

07:25.147 --> 07:28.232
Hi, Colonel Williams,
how can I help you?

07:28.234 --> 07:31.535
What? Oh, uh, yes,
he is from India.

07:33.455 --> 07:36.573
No, I don't know
his immigration status.

07:39.411 --> 07:42.579
Relax, I'm still on hold!

07:44.083 --> 07:46.166
Speaking.

07:46.168 --> 07:50.337
Okay, sure,
I can meet with you on Thursday.

07:50.339 --> 07:51.922
Caltech is fine.

07:51.924 --> 07:54.091
Yeah, and may I ask
what this is about?

07:55.477 --> 07:57.427
I may not?

07:57.429 --> 08:00.430
That's what he said to me.

08:01.567 --> 08:02.683
Here you are, Mother.

08:02.685 --> 08:04.318
Thank you.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.986
I'm glad you decided to stay.

08:05.988 --> 08:09.439
It's gonna be special for Penny
and me to share this with you.

08:09.441 --> 08:13.160
I can't wait
for this day to be over.

08:13.996 --> 08:16.363
Yeah, special, like that.

08:17.199 --> 08:19.783
That's them.

08:19.785 --> 08:20.784
Please don't make things

08:20.786 --> 08:22.753
any more awkward
than they already are.

08:22.755 --> 08:26.840
All right, so less
or equally awkward, got it.

08:28.344 --> 08:29.426
Hey, guys, come on in.

08:29.428 --> 08:31.094
Oh, thank you.
Good morning.

08:31.096 --> 08:32.011
Morning.
Hello.

08:32.014 --> 08:34.014
How is everyone today?

08:34.015 --> 08:35.015
Good, and you?

08:35.017 --> 08:37.100
Good, good.
Good.

08:37.102 --> 08:38.467
I'm good, too.

08:38.470 --> 08:40.354
Good.

08:43.142 --> 08:45.359
So, did you defile
my mother or not?

08:46.312 --> 08:48.862
Sheldon!

08:48.864 --> 08:50.948
You're being rude.

08:50.950 --> 08:52.366
If I may, I can assure you,

08:52.368 --> 08:53.817
your mother and I
did nothing more

08:53.819 --> 08:56.036
than share a cab
and a conversation.

08:56.038 --> 08:58.205
Did that conversation
include the phrase

08:58.207 --> 09:00.374
"your genitals
are a joy to behold"?

09:00.376 --> 09:02.576
That's enough!

09:02.578 --> 09:07.547
Look, I promise you, neither I,
nor anyone, has ever said that.

09:07.549 --> 09:12.219
You don't know his girlfriend
very well.

09:12.221 --> 09:15.339
Or what a joy it is
to behold my genitals.

09:17.509 --> 09:20.010
All right, you guys, uh,
get settled in,

09:20.012 --> 09:22.262
then we'll go across the hall
and say hi to everyone.

09:22.264 --> 09:24.731
You know, It's hard to believe
I've never met Leonard.

09:24.733 --> 09:27.017
Well, he probably buys
his illegal drugs

09:27.019 --> 09:28.185
from a local vendor.

09:29.605 --> 09:31.154
Not funny, Wyatt.

09:31.156 --> 09:33.690
I thought it was really funny.
Thanks.

09:33.692 --> 09:37.077
Well, fine, if everyone wants to
make jokes about our problems,

09:37.079 --> 09:38.028
then I can, too.

09:38.030 --> 09:40.364
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

09:40.366 --> 09:43.083
Our family is an embarrassment.

09:43.085 --> 09:45.012
That's not much of a joke.

09:45.013 --> 09:45.667
Okay.

09:45.671 --> 09:48.038
Listen, Mom, I know you're
nervous, but I promise you,

09:48.040 --> 09:50.374
no one is gonna judge you
or this family.

09:50.376 --> 09:51.875
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:51.877 --> 09:53.210
It's just we're meeting
Leonard's parents

09:53.212 --> 09:54.544
for the first time,

09:54.546 --> 09:57.714
and-and they're academics
and-and intellectuals,

09:57.716 --> 10:00.100
and I don't want them thinking
we're white trash.

10:01.270 --> 10:04.521
Well, what color trash
do you think they'll believe?

10:07.059 --> 10:08.892
How could you think
that I would spend the night

10:08.894 --> 10:10.310
with a man I just met?

10:10.312 --> 10:13.730
A man named Jesus convinced you
to build a church in Africa.

10:13.732 --> 10:16.066
You're kind of a sucker.

10:16.068 --> 10:19.403
Well, nothing happened, right?

10:19.405 --> 10:20.287
I-It's over.

10:20.289 --> 10:21.571
Until we get married
a third time,

10:21.573 --> 10:24.491
you guys will never have
to see each other again.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.376
Well, you know, actually
that's not the case.

10:26.378 --> 10:28.662
- Mary may visit me in New York.
- Mm-hmm.

10:28.664 --> 10:30.831
And he's never been to Texas.

10:30.833 --> 10:32.132
Maybe we meet halfway.

10:32.134 --> 10:36.837
What? In the Chattahoochee
National Forest in Georgia?

10:36.839 --> 10:41.808
I can't be the only one
that knows that's halfway.

10:41.810 --> 10:44.018
You're not seriously going
to visit each other.

10:44.042 --> 10:45.063
And why wouldn't we?

10:45.087 --> 10:47.151
Oh please, you're just saying
this to antagonize me.

10:47.444 --> 10:50.267
Oh, not at all. Mary happens
to be a wonderful woman.

10:50.269 --> 10:52.569
And if it antagonizes you,
that's just a bonus.

10:54.773 --> 10:56.990
Mary, I'm sorry you're
in the middle of this.

10:56.992 --> 10:59.025
No, no, nothing to be
sorry about.

10:59.027 --> 11:01.278
I genuinely like your father.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.030
What? But he's a
mediocre academic.

11:04.032 --> 11:07.617
And according to Beverly,
his sexual prowess is subpar.

11:08.754 --> 11:12.038
He's basically Leonard
with a bigger prostate.

11:14.426 --> 11:17.644
Are you saying that my dad's
not good enough for your mom?

11:17.646 --> 11:19.963
Yes, while also getting in
a solid dig at you.

11:19.965 --> 11:21.548
Pretty efficient, huh?

11:22.801 --> 11:25.635
This is ridiculous.
I-I'm going across the hall.

11:25.637 --> 11:27.554
But why should you get to go
and leave me here

11:27.556 --> 11:28.555
with your bickering parents?

11:28.557 --> 11:29.806
Fine, then you go!

11:29.808 --> 11:31.942
Well, I don't want to stay
here with her. I'll go.

11:31.944 --> 11:32.859
I'll go with you.

11:32.861 --> 11:34.111
That still leaves me
here with him.

11:34.113 --> 11:35.645
Hang on, hang on!

11:35.647 --> 11:37.147
We're smart, we can
figure this out.

11:37.149 --> 11:40.617
Okay, so: Mary and Beverly
can't be together.

11:40.619 --> 11:43.787
Uh, Alfred and Beverly
can't be together.

11:43.789 --> 11:46.289
Leonard and I can't be together.

11:46.291 --> 11:49.042
Now, I could be with Alfred...

11:49.044 --> 11:50.660
but I don't like his face.

11:52.247 --> 11:53.663
Oh, here! I've got it!

11:53.665 --> 11:55.332
Who's ready for a wedding?

11:55.334 --> 11:57.667
Great, now I have
to start all over.

12:05.878 --> 12:08.045
So how's the world
of pharmaceuticals treating you?

12:08.047 --> 12:09.713
Pretty good. I actually
just got assigned

12:09.715 --> 12:11.098
a much better territory.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.717
See what happens
when you work hard?

12:13.719 --> 12:17.104
Hey, she just sells drugs.
I had to make 'em.

12:18.023 --> 12:19.556
Okay, that's enough.

12:19.558 --> 12:22.309
No more drug talk
for the rest of this trip.

12:22.311 --> 12:24.728
I'll drink to that.

12:24.730 --> 12:25.646
Haven't you had enough?

12:25.648 --> 12:27.314
Penny drinks
more than I do.

12:27.316 --> 12:29.783
Well, I learned
from the best.

12:29.785 --> 12:31.618
Aw!
Aw!

12:32.655 --> 12:33.987
Very nice, Wyatt.

12:33.989 --> 12:36.623
And you wonder why this one
turned out the way he did.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.959
You see what I've gotta
put up with!

12:38.961 --> 12:40.961
What you've gotta put up with?

12:40.963 --> 12:42.663
Why did you have
to go to jail?

12:42.665 --> 12:45.883
It's called getting
caught, Mother!

12:45.885 --> 12:47.584
Hello!

12:47.586 --> 12:48.752
Hey, there he is!
Hey!

12:48.754 --> 12:51.672
Oh, Leonard! It's so
nice to see you again!

12:51.674 --> 12:52.756
Oh, you, too!

12:52.758 --> 12:55.225
Hey, everyone, this is
my mother, Beverly.

12:55.227 --> 12:56.343
- Hello.
- Hi.

12:56.345 --> 12:59.563
We are not white trash!

13:03.819 --> 13:06.236
Are you excited to see your son
walk down the aisle?

13:06.238 --> 13:07.354
Yes, I am.

13:07.356 --> 13:08.572
I'm just feeling
a little guilty

13:08.574 --> 13:10.357
about all the trouble
I've caused.

13:10.359 --> 13:12.025
Oh, so am I.

13:12.027 --> 13:15.529
You made God sad today, Mom.

13:22.505 --> 13:24.171
Sheldon, they haven't done
anything wrong.

13:24.173 --> 13:26.707
I think it's nice
they're hitting it off.

13:26.709 --> 13:28.375
Well, that's still no reason
to rush into anything.

13:28.377 --> 13:29.459
Look at us.

13:29.461 --> 13:31.178
We took things
remarkably slow.

13:31.180 --> 13:34.014
You and I, we didn't even
hold hands for two years.

13:35.184 --> 13:38.218
It was a lot hotter
than it sounds.

13:38.220 --> 13:39.520
You're a patient
young lady.

13:39.522 --> 13:40.554
Hey, hey!

13:40.556 --> 13:42.723
She's mine! Take a cold shower,
grandpa!

13:46.862 --> 13:49.112
Why wouldn't that colonel say
what the meeting's about?

13:49.114 --> 13:50.647
It has to be bad news.

13:50.649 --> 13:52.900
Calm down, okay?
Try not to think about it.

13:52.902 --> 13:55.452
That's really stupid advice.

13:55.454 --> 13:57.287
You know that hurts
my feelings.

13:58.123 --> 14:00.457
Calm down, try not
to think about it.

14:01.493 --> 14:03.043
Okay.

14:04.630 --> 14:06.246
Why do I bother
talking to you?

14:06.248 --> 14:08.916
Oh, come on. What's the worst
that could come of this meeting?

14:08.918 --> 14:11.051
I don't know. They take
the invention away,

14:11.053 --> 14:12.219
and I get nothing?

14:12.221 --> 14:14.254
Okay, that's not so bad.

14:14.256 --> 14:15.505
You know what happened
to the scientists

14:15.507 --> 14:17.090
that worked
on the Manhattan Project?

14:17.092 --> 14:19.259
The government forced them
to move to the desert.

14:19.261 --> 14:22.429
They had to live in secret,
and when Oppenheimer objected

14:22.431 --> 14:23.597
to what they made him do,

14:23.599 --> 14:25.599
they destroyed his reputation.

14:26.685 --> 14:29.820
What's the point of that story?

14:31.106 --> 14:32.606
I just read a book
about Oppenheimer,

14:32.608 --> 14:35.909
seemed like a chance
to show off.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.163
There he is!

14:40.165 --> 14:42.332
There's my happy
Hebraic homeboy.

14:42.334 --> 14:43.834
Yeah, that's the smile
I'm gonna remember

14:43.836 --> 14:48.288
when you're living in the desert
and I'm living with your wife.

14:52.177 --> 14:54.177
So, what do you do for a living?

14:54.964 --> 14:57.130
Mommy, you want
to take this one?

14:58.050 --> 15:00.467
Um, Randall's
in between jobs.

15:00.469 --> 15:03.270
And court appearances.

15:04.139 --> 15:05.138
It's nice to meet the woman

15:05.140 --> 15:07.357
who raised this fine young man.

15:07.359 --> 15:09.109
I'm looking forward
to meeting his father.

15:09.111 --> 15:11.561
Prepare to be disappointed.

15:12.448 --> 15:13.614
And he can't wait
to meet you, too.

15:13.616 --> 15:14.982
Can I get anyone a drink?

15:14.984 --> 15:16.400
Well, I could use
another beer.

15:16.402 --> 15:17.484
You're done.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.071
He's done.

15:22.574 --> 15:25.208
Hey! Is everyone getting
to know each other?

15:25.210 --> 15:26.743
Not at all!

15:37.556 --> 15:39.506
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Hofstadter.

15:39.508 --> 15:41.341
I'm, uh, Leonard's friend,
Stuart.

15:41.343 --> 15:43.677
Nice to see you, too.

15:43.679 --> 15:44.895
Hi, I'm Stuart.

15:44.897 --> 15:47.564
Ooh, I'm Alfred.
Leonard's father.

15:47.566 --> 15:51.184
Oh! Oh, hi. Uh, I'm sorry, did
you two want to sit together?

15:51.186 --> 15:53.153
No.
No.

15:54.356 --> 15:59.192
I was wondering why the
front row was available.

15:59.194 --> 16:01.361
Okay, I think
we're ready.

16:09.204 --> 16:11.421
Why do people
cry at weddings?

16:11.423 --> 16:14.591
They're practicing for
what's coming later.

16:19.214 --> 16:22.132
Thank you for cleaning yourself
up for your sister's wedding.

16:22.134 --> 16:25.469
Thank you for my new teeth.

16:29.475 --> 16:31.141
Welcome to the family,
Leonard.

16:31.143 --> 16:33.360
Don't lend your new
brother-in-law money.

16:38.901 --> 16:41.318
We're here today
to celebrate love.

16:44.490 --> 16:46.740
Sigh louder,
no one heard you.

16:48.744 --> 16:50.577
Really, I can move.

16:51.914 --> 16:53.797
Not just Leonard and
Penny's love, but the love

16:53.799 --> 16:56.083
we have for them,
as well as each other.

16:56.085 --> 17:00.420
Speaking of love, STDs among
the elderly are skyrocketing.

17:03.258 --> 17:05.425
Love is patient,
but it's not gonna put up

17:05.426 --> 17:08.095
with all the side chatter,
so let's knock it off!

17:09.765 --> 17:12.015
At least she's yelling at
someone else for a change.

17:12.017 --> 17:14.233
Howard!

17:18.107 --> 17:19.823
Okay, I understand everyone's
a little tense today,

17:19.825 --> 17:22.325
so I am just gonna get
to the important stuff.

17:22.327 --> 17:25.662
Leonard, standing here
with you in front

17:25.664 --> 17:29.583
of our family and friends is
bringing up a lot of feelings.

17:30.619 --> 17:33.670
Like what a good idea it was
to elope the first time.

17:35.541 --> 17:39.042
But also how incredibly
happy you make me.

17:40.379 --> 17:42.129
Thank you for marrying me.

17:42.131 --> 17:43.964
Hopefully for the last time.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.685
Penny...

17:48.687 --> 17:52.355
as a scientist, my job is to
figure out why things happen.

17:52.357 --> 17:55.559
But I don't think
I'll ever understand

17:55.561 --> 18:00.063
how someone like me could get
to be with someone like you.

18:01.150 --> 18:04.151
You know... maybe... I don't
need to understand it,

18:04.153 --> 18:05.235
I just need to be grateful.

18:05.237 --> 18:06.403
I love you, Penny.

18:06.405 --> 18:08.205
Oh...

18:09.825 --> 18:12.793
Anybody have anything snarky
to say about that?

18:14.830 --> 18:16.880
Didn't think so.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.466
I'd like to say something.

18:20.669 --> 18:23.303
Beverly, I know that
we don't bring out

18:23.305 --> 18:24.671
the best in each other.

18:24.673 --> 18:28.842
But something wonderful did
come from our relationship:

18:28.844 --> 18:30.143
that young man right there.

18:31.180 --> 18:33.013
I couldn't agree more.

18:35.317 --> 18:37.601
That's beautiful.

18:39.655 --> 18:42.772
Thank you.
All right, let's continue.

18:42.774 --> 18:45.692
Yeah, excuse me,
I need to say something

18:45.694 --> 18:48.695
to someone pretty special,
and...

18:48.697 --> 18:50.831
I just can't wait any longer.

18:50.833 --> 18:52.532
It's happening.

18:52.534 --> 18:54.501
Leonard...

18:58.207 --> 19:00.707
You and I have
our ups and downs.

19:00.709 --> 19:04.094
But I have always considered
you my family.

19:04.096 --> 19:08.014
Even before the recent threat
of our parents fornicating

19:08.016 --> 19:09.850
like wrinkly old rabbits.

19:14.523 --> 19:18.808
I don't always show it, but you
are of great importance to me.

19:20.112 --> 19:21.811
Both of you.

19:21.813 --> 19:23.396
Oh...

19:23.398 --> 19:24.948
Thank you.

19:24.950 --> 19:26.449
Okay.

19:26.451 --> 19:30.871
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

19:30.873 --> 19:33.373
And weird other husband who came
with the apartment.

19:45.152 --> 19:47.402
Thank you for taking us
to the airport.

19:47.404 --> 19:50.339
Hey, I'm just thrilled we're all
getting along for a minute.

19:50.341 --> 19:51.473
Yeah, me, too.

19:51.475 --> 19:54.126
Beverly, I'm sorry
if I upset you.

19:54.128 --> 19:55.777
Water under the bridge, Alfred.

19:57.114 --> 19:59.281
Leonard, why don't you get
into the carpool lane?

19:59.283 --> 20:01.199
Well, that's a solid line.
He can't cross it.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.534
That's okay.
I can make it over.

20:02.536 --> 20:03.919
No, no, let's plod along.

20:03.921 --> 20:06.204
It'll make your father feel
more comfortable.

20:07.758 --> 20:09.708
What makes me comfortable
is knowing I don't have to

20:09.710 --> 20:12.323
wake up tomorrow morning
and see your sour face.

20:14.356 --> 20:16.596
Do the world a favor, and
don't wake up tomorrow morning.

20:20.222 --> 20:21.912
That was almost a minute.

20:24.744 --> 20:27.086
There's a lot of traffic.
Are we gonna be okay?

20:27.255 --> 20:29.109
You'll be at the airport
an hour before your flight.

20:29.133 --> 20:29.971
Good.
Thank you.

20:29.995 --> 20:33.253
Plenty of time for you to meet
another geriatric boy toy.

20:35.599 --> 20:36.585
Hey.

20:36.609 --> 20:38.731
I will not have you
be disrespectful to me.

20:38.755 --> 20:39.823
Yes ma'am.

20:40.251 --> 20:42.011
Sheldon, you're mother's
an attractive woman.

20:42.214 --> 20:43.511
You need to get used to the fact

20:43.586 --> 20:45.238
that men are going
to be interest in her.

20:45.262 --> 20:47.890
Well.. and you need to drive
the car and mind your business.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.511
I will not have you
be disrespectful to me.

20:51.535 --> 20:52.565
What-- you're not
my mother.

20:52.589 --> 20:54.167
Don't you be disrespectful
to her.

20:54.191 --> 20:55.191
Yes ma'am.

20:56.824 --> 20:57.707
You'll get there.

20:57.731 --> 20:59.874
You've just gotta put
some zing on it.

21:03.993 --> 21:06.309
Penny, I don't know what
I was worried about.

21:06.535 --> 21:07.981
You're friends are
just lovely.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.552
Oh, thanks, Mom.

21:09.723 --> 21:12.311

is a bit peculiar.

21:14.065 --> 21:16.196

I never noticed.

21:17.351 --> 21:19.425
He reminds me
of that turkey we had

21:19.427 --> 21:21.486
who drowned looking up
at the rain.

21:24.597 --> 21:26.741
Cops, cops, be cool!

21:27.305 --> 21:33.784
