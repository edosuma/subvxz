WEBVTT

00:54.168 --> 00:57.469
You always encouraged
me to cause a spot of trouble.

00:57.472 --> 01:01.785
So, today's the day we finally set a bomb
under this town for what they did to you.

01:04.223 --> 01:05.956
But don't worry, Ma.

01:07.393 --> 01:10.427
It'll be over soon,
and I'll be...

01:10.429 --> 01:12.562
halfway across the world.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.000
Where you'd want me to be.

01:45.864 --> 01:47.731
You not gonna talk
about it?

01:51.170 --> 01:52.736
Suit yourself.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.306
- It's my girl.
- Oh, yeah?

01:56.308 --> 01:58.809
- I thought you'd broke up.
- We're on a break.

01:58.811 --> 02:02.145
Oh. And how long's
that been going on now?

02:02.147 --> 02:03.880
Six months.

02:03.882 --> 02:06.216
We still meet up for coffee
from time to time.

02:06.218 --> 02:08.084
Couple of macchiatos, like.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.654
I'm glad you find it
so amusing.

02:18.397 --> 02:20.964
Well, this is it.

02:25.571 --> 02:28.472
It's just, she's been spending a
lot of her time with this fella.

02:28.474 --> 02:31.541
If you've broke up, isn't she
allowed to be seeing other people?

02:31.543 --> 02:32.876
We're just having a wobble.

02:32.878 --> 02:35.946
Colin, man, six months
is more than a wobble.

02:35.948 --> 02:38.615
It's a wobble,
Fergus, okay?

02:46.992 --> 02:48.124
Ready?

02:55.167 --> 02:58.001
So, what's this
fella's name, then?

02:58.003 --> 02:59.736
Tyrone.

02:59.738 --> 03:03.039
Tyrone?
Tyrone, Tyrone, Tyrone.

03:03.041 --> 03:07.344
No, I don't know any Tyrones.
He must be from out of town.

03:07.346 --> 03:10.146
He'll wish he was from out of
town when I get my hands on him.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.349
She probably told the
poor lad she was single.

03:12.351 --> 03:16.520
Ah, leave up. She'll come back.
We've got a connection.

03:17.556 --> 03:19.222
Right you are.

03:21.126 --> 03:23.360
Stop what you're doing,
all of youse!

03:23.362 --> 03:25.896
- Where's the stash?
- What stash? This is a church.

03:25.898 --> 03:28.932
Gentlemen, this is a place of worship.
A holy place.

03:28.934 --> 03:31.635
The drugs. The drugs!
Where are they, Father?

03:31.637 --> 03:33.937
Drugs have no place
in the Catholic Church.

03:33.939 --> 03:37.240
- Who are they?
- This is Father Shenwari.

03:37.242 --> 03:38.675
And this Father Nabi.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.344
They've travelled to Ireland
from Afghanistan

03:41.346 --> 03:43.280
to learn about the Troubles

03:43.282 --> 03:47.183
in order to take the lessons that we
have learned back to their own community.

03:50.389 --> 03:52.322
Can you, uh,
give us a moment?

03:56.461 --> 03:57.894
Excuse us.

03:57.896 --> 04:00.897
Are these fellas proper?
Are you sure about this?

04:00.899 --> 04:04.167
I don't know.
There was meant to be money and MDMA.

04:04.169 --> 04:07.337
Kilos of the stuff changing hands.
That's what she said.

04:07.339 --> 04:08.972
Who's "she"?

04:08.974 --> 04:11.675
- I said "he." The boss.
- Well, it don't look like it.

04:11.677 --> 04:13.243
Oh, shit, man.

04:13.245 --> 04:16.713
I didn't know they had
Catholics in Afghanistan.

04:21.486 --> 04:23.486
Say a Hail Mary.

04:23.488 --> 04:25.055
They don't speak the language.

04:25.057 --> 04:28.258
If he's a Catholic,
he knows a Hail Mary.

04:29.995 --> 04:31.394
Say it.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.464
Take your gun out of Father
Nabi's mouth and be gone.

04:34.466 --> 04:37.033
- This is a church.
- There's a bag!

04:37.035 --> 04:40.170
What's in the bag?
What's in the fucking bag?

04:42.608 --> 04:44.107
Open it.

04:53.018 --> 04:54.818
What the...

05:03.929 --> 05:05.195
Jesus.

05:08.233 --> 05:11.067
Look at this, Fergus.
What a rush, eh?

05:12.204 --> 05:13.803
Yeah.

05:13.805 --> 05:15.205
Don't be so cool
about it.

05:15.207 --> 05:17.340
This is a lot of gear,
isn't it?

05:20.312 --> 05:21.745
Oh, jackpot.

05:21.747 --> 05:24.381
Let's get a look
at your miserable teenage mug.

05:24.383 --> 05:28.018
- Hey, hey! Leave that.
- Relax. It's not that bad.

05:29.655 --> 05:31.021
"Tyrone"?

05:33.358 --> 05:35.225
Little fucker.

05:36.361 --> 05:38.128
Listen, man...

05:39.965 --> 05:44.567
You slimy, inbred,
cheating asshole!

05:44.569 --> 05:46.903
She said you were through.
Please.

05:46.905 --> 05:49.372
Look, don't do anything crazy,
man, okay?

05:49.374 --> 05:51.374
This was all her idea,
I'm telling you.

05:51.376 --> 05:54.344
What were you gonna do to me to make
sure you could get away with it?

05:54.346 --> 05:57.147
We were gonna go to San Francis...

06:02.654 --> 06:04.320
<i>This is the final call</i>

06:04.322 --> 06:07.057
<i>for Flight 162
to San Francisco.</i>

06:07.059 --> 06:11.261
<i>Final call for Flight 162
to San Francisco.</i>

06:32.484 --> 06:35.819
<i>What's up? This is your boy Fergus,</i>

06:35.821 --> 06:38.088
<i>aka the Baddest Man
On The Planet.</i>

06:38.090 --> 06:39.989
<i>Leave us a message,
and I'll get back to you</i>

06:39.991 --> 06:42.625
<i>whenever I bloody well feel like it.</i>

06:42.627 --> 06:45.929
<i>Fergus, where are you?
What's wrong? What's happened?</i>

06:46.732 --> 06:48.465
<i>Where's Colin?</i>

06:55.974 --> 07:00.043
<i>Flight 162 to San Francisco
is now closing.</i>

07:00.045 --> 07:03.880
<i>Flight 162 to San Francisco
is now closing.</i>

07:20.499 --> 07:21.865
Sligo, please.

08:05.143 --> 08:06.442
Hey.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.678
- All right, my love?
- Have you seen Fergus?

08:08.680 --> 08:10.580
- No.
- How about Colin?

08:10.582 --> 08:13.183
I thought
you two were... No?

08:13.185 --> 08:15.585
Neither of them have come in,
as far as I know.

08:15.587 --> 08:17.153
Can I get you anything?

08:17.155 --> 08:19.122
Tequila would be grand.

08:21.359 --> 08:24.194
Move, will ya?

08:24.196 --> 08:27.163
- Ah, Sarah, you sexy little ferret.
- Prick!

08:27.165 --> 08:31.301
Barry, I want that 20 tonight,
or I will have your ball sack.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.037
- Daniel, man.
- What's the crack, fellas?

08:34.039 --> 08:35.938
- Not bad.
- All right.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.909
- For you.
- For you.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.878
Thank you.

08:43.715 --> 08:45.315
Nice.

08:46.151 --> 08:49.419
- For the fallen.
- We will remember them.

08:57.929 --> 08:59.896
I gotta talk to her.

08:59.898 --> 09:01.798
What are you gonna say
to Pixie Hardy

09:01.800 --> 09:05.235
that you haven't managed to
say up to this point in time?

09:06.838 --> 09:10.139
I don't know.
Something charming.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.321
I swear, she always
gives me the eyes.

09:25.323 --> 09:28.157
She doesn't remember
your name, man.

09:28.159 --> 09:31.661
Ah, fuck it, I'll tell you something.
Come with me.

09:43.508 --> 09:46.309
Three in the bed,
and the little one said...

09:47.545 --> 09:49.979
"Let's do
some fucking drugs."

09:54.753 --> 09:57.253
Now, I'd like to preface this
by saying I don't support

09:57.255 --> 09:59.656
either of youse acting upon
what I'm about to tell you.

09:59.658 --> 10:02.091
- Rumours are going round...
- Oh, yeah. Go on.

10:03.495 --> 10:05.194
She's gotten into
taking photos.

10:05.196 --> 10:07.897
Apparently,
Pixie is preparing her application

10:07.899 --> 10:09.632
to the San Francisco
Institute of Art

10:09.634 --> 10:12.635
and wants to be like
this Nan Goldin lady.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.105
I don't know. Anyway,

10:16.107 --> 10:19.842
her photos have taken
a turn for the experimental.

10:19.844 --> 10:22.111
What do you mean,
"experimental"?

10:22.113 --> 10:27.317
I've heard she likes to take photos
of herself having sex with men.

10:27.319 --> 10:29.519
What are you saying?

10:29.521 --> 10:32.255
I'm saying that
either of you twos

10:32.257 --> 10:33.957
can potentially
go home with her tonight

10:33.959 --> 10:37.794
as long as you don't mind your
hairy arses being on film.

10:37.796 --> 10:40.663
However,
I'd like to remind you

10:40.665 --> 10:42.699
who it is
we're talking about here.

10:42.701 --> 10:45.702
This is Pixie Hardy.
She won't just break you.

10:45.704 --> 10:48.604
She'll take a Kalashnikov
to your heart.

10:56.314 --> 10:58.614
You sure
this is her house?

11:00.418 --> 11:02.085
I'm sure.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.955
How are we even
gonna do this?

11:05.957 --> 11:07.290
Hmm.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.061
How about
I go in first,

11:12.063 --> 11:13.997
and you wait here
till I'm finished,

11:13.999 --> 11:17.600
then you go in after
and I'll wait?

11:17.602 --> 11:19.669
Piss off. Why isn't
there an option

11:19.671 --> 11:21.871
where I go in and you wait,
and then you go in after?

11:21.873 --> 11:25.274
- 'Cause I'm the oldest.
- Because you were born in April

11:25.276 --> 11:27.677
and I was born in June,
I have to go in second?

11:27.679 --> 11:31.314
Just put the radio on.
I might be a while.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.682
Frank.

11:34.052 --> 11:36.052
That's not fair.

11:58.009 --> 12:00.043
This is gonna be
a laugh.

12:04.149 --> 12:06.783
Now, now. Frank McCullen.

12:06.785 --> 12:11.654
It's very late to be knocking on
young ladies' doors, isn't it?

12:11.656 --> 12:13.122
Little lost, are we?

12:13.124 --> 12:16.325
No. See, uh, recently,

12:16.327 --> 12:18.728
I've been getting into
taking photos.

12:18.730 --> 12:20.596
Photos?

12:20.598 --> 12:25.635
I was just wondering if you happened
to know any good photo shops nearby.

12:25.637 --> 12:28.071
You came to my house
at 2:00 in the morning

12:28.073 --> 12:30.006
to see if there was a camera
shop in the neighbourhood?

12:30.008 --> 12:33.242
I was told you were the
person I should be talking to.

12:33.244 --> 12:35.478
People in this town
need to learn

12:35.480 --> 12:38.548
that other people's business
really isn't their business.

12:39.451 --> 12:40.650
Sorry.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.391
So, can I come in?

12:48.393 --> 12:50.693
I didn't slam the door
in your face, did I?

12:52.564 --> 12:55.231
- Come on, then, Richard Avedon.
- Richard who?

12:56.868 --> 12:59.769
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Are you...?

12:59.771 --> 13:04.107
Oh, for God's sake.
What a jammy bastard.

13:09.447 --> 13:12.748
You believe in God,
don't you, Tommy?

13:12.750 --> 13:15.017
Well, there's part of me
wants to believe in it.

13:15.019 --> 13:17.854
For the wife and the children.
Know what I mean, sir?

13:17.856 --> 13:19.889
But I work for you,
boss.

13:19.891 --> 13:24.293
I've no right to judge.
You've been very good to me, you know?

13:24.295 --> 13:27.130
But some of the things
we've done...

13:28.199 --> 13:30.032
I don't mean any offence,
you know.

13:30.034 --> 13:34.303
What about reincarnation?
What do you think of all that?

13:35.173 --> 13:37.673
That's a lovely concept,
that, sir.

13:37.675 --> 13:40.977
Unless you come back
as a fucking ant.

13:40.979 --> 13:42.879
So, what's the plan?

13:46.784 --> 13:48.718
I don't know.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.287
- Tommy?
- Yes, boss.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.357
Clear this up.

13:54.359 --> 13:56.626
Get rid of the body
and the vehicle.

13:56.628 --> 14:00.129
The last thing we need is the
Guards breathing down our necks.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.430
Yes, boss.

14:01.432 --> 14:05.334
- So we just do nothing?
- We wait.

14:05.336 --> 14:08.704
Trouble will find us.
It always does.

14:08.706 --> 14:11.274
And when it does,
we'll be ready.

14:11.276 --> 14:13.676
Boss, you might wanna
have a look at this.

14:22.921 --> 14:24.954
Tommy?

14:24.956 --> 14:26.322
Yes, boss.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.191
Find the fucking panda.

14:36.267 --> 14:37.967
Pixie?

14:39.837 --> 14:42.104
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

14:42.106 --> 14:43.906
Pixie!

14:43.908 --> 14:45.575
Fuck.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.880
I'm not joking around, Pix.

14:50.882 --> 14:53.849
I'll knock this fucking
door down if I have to!

15:13.071 --> 15:15.638
Relax your jaw.

15:19.010 --> 15:22.511
You'd better not have
someone else up there!

15:23.848 --> 15:26.015
We had a connection!

15:27.952 --> 15:29.852
I know you're in there.

15:34.292 --> 15:36.092
- That's it.
- Oh, shit.

15:36.094 --> 15:39.362
I'm coming in! I'll shoot
your fucking door in.

15:39.364 --> 15:42.965
I know what you fucking did!

15:42.967 --> 15:45.001
Oh, shit!

15:50.074 --> 15:51.841
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

15:59.484 --> 16:01.350
Sir?

16:03.521 --> 16:05.855
Sir, are you okay?

16:14.499 --> 16:16.499
Now, if I want
to reach you,

16:16.501 --> 16:18.834
do you have a number
I can call, or...

16:19.671 --> 16:21.671
My phone's broken.

16:22.573 --> 16:25.474
Okay, well,
why don't I give you mine?

16:25.476 --> 16:27.743
Do you have a pen?

16:27.745 --> 16:29.445
Go for it.

16:34.118 --> 16:37.853
I tell you what.
Why don't I leave you my address too?

16:37.855 --> 16:41.390
You know, just in case you're in the
neighbourhood, you wanna stop by.

16:41.392 --> 16:43.292
I mean,
I'm always there.

16:43.294 --> 16:47.029
Not that I don't do anything, like.
You know, I'm quite important.

16:47.031 --> 16:48.464
Well, I will be.

16:48.466 --> 16:51.534
I've got plans.
Ambitions, like.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.107
I'm gonna go,
but you know where to find me.

16:58.109 --> 16:59.608
I do.

17:01.112 --> 17:03.279
Okay, ask me
a capital city.

17:03.281 --> 17:04.747
What?

17:04.749 --> 17:06.949
Name any country,
and I'll tell you the capital.

17:09.252 --> 17:10.453
Albania.

17:10.454 --> 17:12.521
Tirana.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.758
That's very impressive.

17:18.061 --> 17:19.694
Okay.

17:19.696 --> 17:20.963
Frank.

17:25.603 --> 17:27.670
You've got a little...

17:29.207 --> 17:30.740
There.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.721
Oh, Frank. Thank God.

17:45.723 --> 17:48.057
What have you been doing?

17:51.529 --> 17:53.195
We've got a problem.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.097
What?
What sort of problem?

17:55.099 --> 17:58.934
I'm gonna show you something, but you
promise me you're not gonna scream,

17:58.936 --> 18:01.103
you're not gonna make
a fucking scene, all right?

18:01.105 --> 18:03.572
- We're deep... We're deep in the fucking shit...
- Would you stop?

18:03.574 --> 18:06.308
You're freaking me out. What?

18:06.310 --> 18:07.843
Come with me.

18:14.519 --> 18:16.018
- Jesus!
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

18:16.020 --> 18:18.654
Who the fuck is that?
Is he dead?

18:18.656 --> 18:21.123
No, he's having a fucking nap!
Yes, he's dead!

18:21.125 --> 18:24.026
- Harland, what's in the bag?
- I didn't look.

18:24.028 --> 18:26.362
What do you mean,
you didn't look?

18:26.364 --> 18:28.230
Fuck me!

18:28.232 --> 18:30.633
Come on, let's get
the hell out of here.

18:36.374 --> 18:38.174
This was self-defence,
like.

18:38.176 --> 18:40.009
Doesn't look that way,
though, does it?

18:40.011 --> 18:41.944
The guy had a gun.
He was gonna kill you.

18:41.946 --> 18:44.747
All I'm saying is,
you put him in the boot of the car.

18:44.749 --> 18:48.217
- Only murderers put people in the boots of their cars.
- But I didn't know what to do.

18:48.219 --> 18:50.386
We just gotta, you know,
think through the options.

18:50.388 --> 18:54.457
Think through... What options?
We have to go to the police.

18:55.293 --> 18:57.026
Do we?

18:58.830 --> 19:01.864
From your point of view,
like, best-case scenario,

19:01.866 --> 19:05.234
you gotta be thinking three
years for manslaughter?

19:05.236 --> 19:09.038
- I mean, think of your little arsehole, man.
- What? Wait, what?

19:09.040 --> 19:11.974
Your teeny tiny
little arsehole.

19:13.711 --> 19:16.479
This, and prison.

19:16.481 --> 19:21.183
- What are you doing?
- You'll be able to shit out a watermelon by the end of it.

19:21.185 --> 19:23.719
This is our chance, man.

19:23.721 --> 19:25.821
Right here, right now.

19:25.823 --> 19:28.424
Let's get the hell out.

19:28.426 --> 19:30.192
Okay, okay, okay.

19:30.194 --> 19:32.761
Surely there's someone we can talk
to, someone we can trust,

19:32.763 --> 19:35.764
with a bit of experience
of this sort of thing.

19:35.766 --> 19:38.734
Fuck. That's brilliant.
I've got the perfect person.

19:38.736 --> 19:40.135
- Who?
- Daniel.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.804
Oh, piss off.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.373
Daniel's the reason we're in this
situation in the first place.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.775
Listen,
he's a drug dealer.

19:46.777 --> 19:49.478
And what do all small-time
drug dealers have in common?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.780
Lack of a proper
role model.

19:51.782 --> 19:55.784
What? Suppliers.
They all have suppliers.

19:55.786 --> 19:58.587
We get Daniel to put us in
touch with his supplier,

19:58.589 --> 20:01.323
we sell him the gear,
and we're home free.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.560
And most importantly,
we're filthy, filthy rich.

20:04.562 --> 20:06.595
I don't know, man.

20:06.597 --> 20:09.999
It feels like we're entering into murky
waters here. Do you know what I mean?

20:10.001 --> 20:13.135
There's a dead fella
in the boot of your car.

20:13.137 --> 20:15.971
I think we're a bit past
murky waters, man.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.681
- Ah! Pix, how are you?
- Da.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.650
- How are ya?
- Come in, come in.

20:27.652 --> 20:29.151
You feel trim.

20:29.153 --> 20:31.820
Just feeling a
bit soft around the edges.

20:31.822 --> 20:33.956
- Don't be silly.
- Oh, thank you very much.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.858
- Hey, Sis.
- Hello, Summer.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.827
- Mwah! Mm, last night's takings?
- Mm-hmm.

20:38.829 --> 20:41.697
Da! Looks delicious.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.632
Thank you.

20:43.634 --> 20:45.634
Let's have a go.

20:47.905 --> 20:49.405
- Do you like it?
- Mm.

20:49.407 --> 20:51.273
- It's your mother's recipe.
- Yeah, I can tell.

20:51.275 --> 20:54.043
- I made it from scratch.
- Yeah, it's good.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.846
Maybe it needs
something, uh...

21:00.017 --> 21:02.318
Have you been to see her
recently?

21:03.821 --> 21:05.988
It'll be four years
next month.

21:08.292 --> 21:10.693
- Feels like ten.
- Yeah.

21:13.097 --> 21:17.032
What have I told you about that
disgusting habit in the home?

21:17.034 --> 21:18.067
Mm, mm.

21:18.069 --> 21:21.637
If you want to smoke,
do it properly.

21:21.639 --> 21:23.339
It's embarrassing.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.141
What did I do
to deserve you?

21:26.143 --> 21:28.677
What did I do to deserve
you, more like?

21:28.679 --> 21:31.447
I mean, all I seem to have gotten
from you is this double chin.

21:31.449 --> 21:34.416
Oh, it's just your puppy fat.
It'll go.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.620
Puppy fat? I heard that
little shit Finian Keane

21:37.622 --> 21:39.755
calling me "gobbler,"
as in the turkey,

21:39.757 --> 21:42.024
behind my back to a group
of lads the other week.

21:42.026 --> 21:43.859
Had to knock
his two front teeth out.

21:43.861 --> 21:46.762
- Isn't Finian your friend?
- I mean, "gobbler"...

21:46.764 --> 21:48.697
It's highly offensive.

21:50.501 --> 21:52.835
- How are you, Mick?
- Hungry.

21:52.837 --> 21:55.037
What are you lot
smiling about?

21:55.039 --> 21:56.905
Summer was telling us
a story from school.

21:56.907 --> 22:01.176
Ah, was it the one about the time
she got her period in swimming class,

22:01.178 --> 22:04.279
and all the lads started
humming the <i>Jaws</i> theme tune?

22:10.488 --> 22:12.655
Let's eat.

22:14.992 --> 22:16.959
Have you told her yet?

22:16.961 --> 22:20.029
- Told me what?
- Colin's missing.

22:20.031 --> 22:23.766
There was a car accident.
We have our best men on it.

22:25.102 --> 22:26.368
Okay.

22:26.370 --> 22:28.837
You could act a little
more fucking upset, like.

22:28.839 --> 22:30.906
Piss off, Mick.
You're being a dickhead.

22:30.908 --> 22:32.441
- Hey!
- Mickey!

22:32.443 --> 22:34.543
No, I'm just saying.
We're sat here telling her

22:34.545 --> 22:36.545
that her boyfriend's probably bled
out in a ditch in God knows where...

22:36.547 --> 22:39.048
Ex-boyfriend.

22:39.050 --> 22:42.851
- Who else was in the car?
- Fergus.

22:43.788 --> 22:45.821
He got one in the head.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.023
Fergus was shot?

22:48.025 --> 22:50.426
Straight through the temple.

22:56.967 --> 22:58.867
Just need a tinkle.

23:02.773 --> 23:05.207
You apologise
to your sister.

23:05.209 --> 23:06.842
Step-sister.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.343
Stop acting the prick!

23:08.345 --> 23:11.146
Now, you go and apologise to her.
I mean it, Mick!

23:11.148 --> 23:15.217
And you clip Summer round
the head again like that,

23:15.219 --> 23:18.220
you'll have more than a
talking-to, rest assured.

23:25.796 --> 23:28.597
You know, I heard the most
fucked thing in school yesterday.

23:28.599 --> 23:31.600
- Language, Summer.
- Sorry. But you'll love this, right?

23:31.602 --> 23:35.404
So, apparently, bubble gum doesn't dissolve
in your stomach for at least seven years.

23:35.406 --> 23:38.273
Got me thinking, you could whack
someone by force-feeding them it

23:38.275 --> 23:40.109
until their stomach
explodes.

23:40.111 --> 23:42.711
I mean, imagine that.
Death by bubble gum.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.180
I mean,
it's pretty cool.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.789
Do you think Lucy O'Malley would've
still ditched you at the debs

23:53.791 --> 23:56.325
if she'd known you'd turn out
to be a cold-blooded killer?

23:56.327 --> 23:58.694
Stop, will you?
This isn't funny.

23:58.696 --> 24:02.564
Just saying. She's still cute, you know.
You should give her a call.

24:02.566 --> 24:06.401
Have you thought about
what we're gonna do with the body?

24:06.403 --> 24:08.303
You're the one
who went to university.

24:08.305 --> 24:11.740
- We'll work it out. It'll be a doddle.
- Oh, a doddle.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.442
Funnily enough,
disposing of bodies

24:13.444 --> 24:17.079
was not part of my fucking
sociology degree.

24:18.482 --> 24:20.015
Daniel, man.

24:20.017 --> 24:22.718
All right, lads.
Didn't expect to see youse here.

24:22.720 --> 24:25.354
- How are we feeling?
- A little ropey, to be honest.

24:25.356 --> 24:29.558
Ah. I've got just the thing
for you somewhere here.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.193
Try this.

24:33.664 --> 24:35.030
Thanks.

24:36.534 --> 24:40.335
- Suit yourself.
- God, it smells good. What is it?

24:40.337 --> 24:44.139
Ladies' moisturiser.
Créme de la Mer, it's called.

24:44.141 --> 24:47.075
It actually does make
such a difference.

24:47.077 --> 24:49.645
Yeah, I bet.
Feels lovely.

24:49.647 --> 24:51.180
Yeah.

24:52.850 --> 24:54.850
Are you gonna ask?

24:56.187 --> 24:57.853
We need to meet
your supplier.

24:57.855 --> 24:59.755
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

24:59.757 --> 25:01.557
Easy there, fellas.

25:01.559 --> 25:05.127
I mean, yeah, we're friends and
all, but this, this is my town.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.963
We're selling bulk.
One deal.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.332
It's way too big
for you, trust me.

25:12.603 --> 25:16.939
Oh, sorry, Mr Pablo Escobar!
Welcome to Sligo!

25:18.175 --> 25:20.075
Let's see it, then.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.580
Too big for me, is it?

25:26.817 --> 25:28.317
Jesus.

25:32.223 --> 25:34.456
There's 15 kilos there.

25:38.762 --> 25:42.664
Right. Let's cut out the middle man,
lads, and I'll give you 400 for it.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.399
Are you taking the piss?

25:44.401 --> 25:46.468
Eight hundred, okay?
I'm not very liquid at the moment, lads.

25:46.470 --> 25:48.570
I'll give you 800
in instalments.

25:48.572 --> 25:50.973
Now, that's the final offer
there, okay?

25:50.975 --> 25:52.774
Stop being a dickhead.

25:52.776 --> 25:55.444
This right here has a street value
of just under one million Euro.

25:55.446 --> 25:57.946
- Who told you that?
- I googled it.

25:57.948 --> 26:00.649
Oh, did you?
Do you like computers?

26:00.651 --> 26:03.552
Please, Daniel.
Do us a solid.

26:03.554 --> 26:05.921
Well, what if I don't
wanna give it to you, huh?

26:05.923 --> 26:07.556
I'll tell big Oisin Fogarty

26:07.558 --> 26:09.925
you've been having his underage
sister at your parties,

26:09.927 --> 26:13.629
plying her with dodgy
methamphetamines and broken promises.

26:13.631 --> 26:15.931
You wouldn't want that,
now, would you?

26:18.969 --> 26:21.036
It's my uncle Raymond.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.971
Your uncle
is your supplier?

26:22.973 --> 26:26.408
- Have you got a problem with that, smart-arse?
- No. No, I don't.

26:28.445 --> 26:32.080
It's a dangerous path
you're taking here, boys.

26:32.082 --> 26:34.316
I'm not gonna lie to you.

26:34.318 --> 26:36.919
I mean, you're talking about
some real players here.

26:36.921 --> 26:39.087
Real players.

26:39.089 --> 26:42.424
I mean, one minute
you're laughing, smiling,

26:42.426 --> 26:45.427
all easy-breezy, like,
then bang!

26:47.164 --> 26:49.331
You've got a Glock
between your eyes,

26:49.333 --> 26:52.267
and you're begging
for your mother's life.

26:52.269 --> 26:53.602
Begging.

26:54.171 --> 26:56.004
You're a star.

26:57.174 --> 26:58.740
Where will
we find him?

26:58.742 --> 27:03.045
Donnelly's.
It's down in Dingle on the water.

27:03.047 --> 27:04.579
Google it.

27:05.649 --> 27:07.416
Thanks.

27:11.121 --> 27:13.555
You in on this?

27:13.557 --> 27:16.258
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Don't play dumb with me.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.327
You and Colin cooked
something up, eh?

27:18.329 --> 27:20.796
I told you,
we broke up months ago.

27:20.798 --> 27:26.068
You may be able to pull the wool
over his eyes, but I see you.

27:26.070 --> 27:29.738
You see me.
You see right through me.

27:29.740 --> 27:32.040
You're fucked in the head,
just like your ma was,

27:32.042 --> 27:34.910
and you'll be with her sooner than
you'd planned if this comes back to you.

27:34.912 --> 27:37.446
I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:39.550 --> 27:42.184
Why have you always
had it in for me?

27:42.186 --> 27:44.019
'Cause you're a liar.

27:44.021 --> 27:46.922
You've always wanted
to turn Da on me.

27:46.924 --> 27:49.691
Now you see your chance,
don't you,

27:49.693 --> 27:52.094
to pin this on me?

27:52.096 --> 27:55.630
Could be the two of youse
in perfect harmony.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.966
No wonder you can't get
a girlfriend.

27:57.968 --> 28:00.268
Shut up.

28:09.780 --> 28:11.880
You like that,
don't you?

28:11.882 --> 28:14.816
Ah, you're a sick, sick
boy, Mickey O'Brien.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.618
Leave off.

28:16.620 --> 28:20.322
Ah, come on, Mickey.
You know you want to.

28:34.071 --> 28:35.904
Did you apologise?

28:35.906 --> 28:37.939
Can we eat?

28:37.941 --> 28:40.108
Wait
for your sister.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.213
- You all right?
- Yeah.

28:52.456 --> 28:53.789
Mmm. Mmm.

28:54.525 --> 28:56.425
- It's got a kick.
- What?

28:56.427 --> 28:58.293
Your hollandaise.
It has a kick to it.

28:58.295 --> 29:00.162
Mam would have
loved it.

29:01.899 --> 29:04.466
You know,
it's easy, really.

29:57.454 --> 30:00.355
- You got anyone coming over?
- No. You?

30:03.227 --> 30:05.227
Let's get this...
Let's get this away.

30:05.229 --> 30:07.162
Who's gonna open it?

30:07.164 --> 30:09.531
Well,
you're older, so...

30:17.908 --> 30:20.575
Hey!

30:22.346 --> 30:25.347
Hey to you too.
Gonna let me in?

30:26.884 --> 30:30.185
Sorry. Of course.
After you.

30:30.187 --> 30:32.287
Pixie, this is
my best mate, Harland.

30:32.289 --> 30:34.489
You probably haven't
noticed him round.

30:34.491 --> 30:38.293
I know you, Harland McKenna.
You well?

30:38.295 --> 30:40.395
Yeah, not bad.

30:40.397 --> 30:42.697
- These your digs?
- Temporarily, yeah.

30:42.699 --> 30:45.033
- Temporarily?
- Well, to be honest,

30:45.035 --> 30:47.903
I've been looking at a few potential
property deals that would be,

30:47.905 --> 30:50.939
you know, significantly larger than this,
but with the markets in this state...

30:50.941 --> 30:53.441
I'm guessing you fellas aren't
used to being in the hot water

30:53.443 --> 30:55.877
you find yourselves in
currently, is that correct?

30:58.649 --> 30:59.981
Excuse me?

31:00.851 --> 31:02.884
I'm also guessing
it's under the bed.

31:05.556 --> 31:06.922
- I'm gonna take a look.
- I don't... We don't...

31:06.924 --> 31:09.391
I don't know
what we're talking about.

31:09.393 --> 31:11.693
There's no hot water
under the bed.

31:11.695 --> 31:15.630
Harland, I'm gonna take
a look now, okay?

31:16.767 --> 31:17.866
Okay.

31:24.274 --> 31:25.907
Really?

31:34.418 --> 31:36.451
- Where's the money?
- Money?

31:36.453 --> 31:39.387
- Frank.
- That was the only bag.

31:39.389 --> 31:42.557
The only thing
I can't put my finger on

31:42.559 --> 31:44.759
is where's the body?

31:44.761 --> 31:45.994
- Body?
- Frank?

31:45.996 --> 31:47.462
- It's in the boot of the car.
- Frank, man.

31:47.464 --> 31:50.332
The way I see it,
you got two options.

31:50.334 --> 31:53.101
One: Kill me,

31:53.103 --> 31:56.838
which wouldn't be very smart, since I'm
your only shot of getting out of this mess.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.040
Or two: You confirm
my suspicions

31:59.042 --> 32:02.477
that the fella you ran into
was coming to kill me,

32:02.479 --> 32:05.280
in which case,
you saved my life.

32:05.282 --> 32:07.048
If the second is true,
then thank you,

32:07.050 --> 32:10.085
and we should consider joining
forces to get the hell out of here

32:10.087 --> 32:12.921
and sell those drugs before
Step-daddy comes a-knocking.

32:12.923 --> 32:14.522
Step-daddy?

32:14.524 --> 32:17.659
Well, he's really my dad,
for all intents and purposes.

32:17.661 --> 32:20.629
My biological one ran off
with a Chinese keyboardist

32:20.631 --> 32:22.530
called Lao Ming
when I was a baby.

32:22.532 --> 32:25.467
Worst thing being, my mam was the lead
singer of the band they were all in.

32:25.469 --> 32:27.702
Hippies use the term
"free love."

32:27.704 --> 32:31.273
However, Mam soon found this to be more of a
catchy slogan than a practical lifestyle choice.

32:31.275 --> 32:34.743
Anyway, he, Dermot,
the step-daddy, that is,

32:34.745 --> 32:37.879
took me and Mam in
when I was eight.

32:37.881 --> 32:40.415
They fell madly in love.

32:40.417 --> 32:42.717
Sweet, really.

32:42.719 --> 32:46.655
But that's not to say it's
all been sunshine and roses.

32:48.091 --> 32:52.594
He is a gangster, after all,
with a penchant for violence.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.163
And he has a son
from a previous marriage

32:55.165 --> 32:58.667
who may actually turn out to be
the devil incarnate.

32:58.669 --> 33:00.869
Look, it's a lot to take in,
I know.

33:00.871 --> 33:03.004
But I figure you've got a
corpse in the back of your car,

33:03.006 --> 33:05.307
and you're looking to skip town
quick, am I right?

33:05.309 --> 33:07.175
"Penchant."

33:07.177 --> 33:09.377
That's not what
it means, Frank.

33:11.081 --> 33:12.480
And you're right.

33:12.482 --> 33:15.850
Well, that settles it, then.

33:17.621 --> 33:20.288
Let's hit the road, boys.

33:20.290 --> 33:24.693
I should probably let you know up
front that I'm partial to an adventure.

33:42.179 --> 33:46.081
So let me get this straight:
Your stepfather is a gangster.

33:46.083 --> 33:49.217
He's also a patron of the arts.
He likes opera.

33:49.219 --> 33:55.357
What? Just 'cause you kill people
occasionally, you can't like a bit of Wagner?

33:55.359 --> 33:58.526
- I love Wagner.
- Shut the fuck up, Frank.

33:58.528 --> 34:00.895
He grew up running guns
for the IRA.

34:00.897 --> 34:02.430
- Heavy.
- Yeah.

34:02.432 --> 34:05.467
His old partner in crime was a
fella called Father Hector McGrath.

34:05.469 --> 34:07.135
A priest? Honestly?

34:07.137 --> 34:09.938
That bag of goodies came into
this fair isle through McGrath.

34:09.940 --> 34:13.875
You see, the guards will never
search a priest, now, will they?

34:13.877 --> 34:16.777
- Come again?
- They can get away with murder.

34:16.780 --> 34:19.280
Literally.
Or, for example,

34:19.282 --> 34:22.016
institutional paedophilia
for a couple of thousand years.

34:23.786 --> 34:26.154
- So they still work together?
- No.

34:26.156 --> 34:28.456
No, their split-up was
somewhat acrimonious.

34:28.458 --> 34:33.128
They vowed if one was to cross the
other again, there'd be all-out war.

34:33.130 --> 34:35.530
So you're saying it's
priests that are after us?

34:35.532 --> 34:38.666
Deadly gangster priests,
yeah.

34:51.181 --> 34:55.049
<i>Although I claim my Italian roast
chicken is cooked with vegetables,</i>

34:55.051 --> 34:58.353
<i>strictly speaking,
these peppers are a fruit.</i>

34:58.355 --> 35:00.522
<i>I use red peppers for this,
orange,</i>

35:00.524 --> 35:02.657
<i>I use yellow,
or a mixture of all three.</i>

35:02.659 --> 35:05.894
<i>However.
I will excommunicate anyone</i>

35:05.896 --> 35:08.363
<i>who even thinks
of using a green pepper.</i>

35:08.365 --> 35:11.299
<i>And this is not
rank colour prejudice.</i>

35:11.301 --> 35:15.770
<i>This is because a green pepper
is simply an unripe pepper.</i>

35:16.540 --> 35:18.673
Da, you have to see this.

35:18.675 --> 35:20.475
No, Mickey,
don't do...

35:20.477 --> 35:23.912
<i>The four priests were found dead
this morning by widower Maeve Smith.</i>

35:23.914 --> 35:26.014
<i>Here she is
with Father Hector McGrath.</i>

35:26.016 --> 35:27.715
<i>I went into the room,</i>

35:27.717 --> 35:31.519
<i>and it was all blood
and bodies everywhere.</i>

35:32.522 --> 35:35.924
<i>I only went in
to light a candle for Paulie.</i>

35:35.926 --> 35:38.927
<i>And then this.
I mean, I couldn't believe it.</i>

35:38.929 --> 35:41.396
<i>This is supposed to be
a place of worship.</i>

35:41.398 --> 35:44.966
<i>This is a sad day in the
history of our country</i>

35:44.968 --> 35:47.969
<i>and a sad day
for the Church.</i>

35:47.971 --> 35:51.239
<i>I want to reassure
the people watching</i>

35:51.241 --> 35:53.174
<i>that senseless acts
of violence like this</i>

35:53.176 --> 35:55.977
<i>will not go unnoticed
by our Father,</i>

35:55.979 --> 36:00.548
<i>and that the Lord
will have his vengeance.</i>

36:22.439 --> 36:24.772
We need to hit them now.

36:26.076 --> 36:29.811
- Mickey, it's not...
- It's not what, Da?

36:29.813 --> 36:32.514
There's a war coming,
and you know it, and I know it,

36:32.516 --> 36:34.182
and if we don't act
right this instant,

36:34.184 --> 36:37.085
they're gonna torch us
in our fucking sleep.

36:39.189 --> 36:43.258
We don't know that Colin and
Fergus were responsible for this,

36:43.260 --> 36:44.692
so neither do they.

36:44.694 --> 36:46.961
It doesn't matter
who's responsible.

36:46.963 --> 36:51.065
Father McGrath has got one name
in his head, and that's yours.

36:53.403 --> 36:55.303
We'll call Seamus.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.407
Seamus?

36:59.409 --> 37:01.509
Like, uh,

37:01.511 --> 37:02.844
Seamus, Seamus?

37:02.846 --> 37:05.213
<i>The</i> Seamus?

37:05.215 --> 37:07.081
Just to investigate.

37:10.620 --> 37:13.655
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, now we're cooking.

37:13.657 --> 37:16.724
And there was me thinking
that you'd lost it.

37:30.307 --> 37:32.040
Stop!

37:39.516 --> 37:40.815
Stop! Help!

37:42.919 --> 37:45.587
What's that?
Are you ready to talk?

37:45.589 --> 37:49.724
Ooh, baby. Ooh!

37:49.726 --> 37:51.593
Stop! Stop!

37:51.595 --> 37:55.697
You need to talk
a little bit louder, fella.

37:55.699 --> 37:57.699
I can't fucking hear ya!

37:57.701 --> 38:00.034
Stop! Stop!

38:01.905 --> 38:04.172
Stop!
I'll tell you anything!

38:16.519 --> 38:19.087
- It's at my brother Pete's house.
- Is it, now?

38:19.089 --> 38:20.888
It's all there, I swear.
It's all there.

38:20.890 --> 38:22.924
You see? You feel better
already. huh?

38:22.926 --> 38:25.526
The truth
always feels better.

38:25.528 --> 38:29.397
- I'm still going to have to kill you, though.
- No, please! No, no!

38:29.399 --> 38:31.232
Please, I've got a family, kids.

38:31.234 --> 38:32.967
- Please, no.
- For fuck's sake.

38:32.969 --> 38:35.036
No, please,
think of my family.

38:35.038 --> 38:36.704
- Please. Please!
- Hello?

38:36.706 --> 38:39.407
- <i>Seamus.</i>
- Shut up, will you? I'm on the phone.

38:39.409 --> 38:42.043
- Seamus.
- Ah. Mr O'Brien.

38:42.045 --> 38:43.778
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

38:43.780 --> 38:46.147
- You heard the news?
- The priests?

38:46.149 --> 38:48.850
Jesus. That's a shocking
state of affairs altogether.

38:48.852 --> 38:52.020
Quite, yeah. Listen,
we picked up Fergus.

38:52.022 --> 38:54.155
He'd been shot a couple
of miles down the road.

38:54.157 --> 38:57.125
But we need you to find
Colin before they do.

38:57.127 --> 39:00.428
- Any leads?
- Ah, we're struggling a bit.

39:00.430 --> 39:02.063
Follow Pixie.

39:02.065 --> 39:03.665
Sorry?

39:03.667 --> 39:05.500
Ignore that.
Mickey, enough.

39:05.502 --> 39:07.802
- I'm just saying, if you follow her, you'll find him.
- Mick...

39:07.804 --> 39:09.437
Listen,
she's up to no good.

39:09.439 --> 39:11.739
I swear to God, Mick,
if you don't stop interfering...

39:11.741 --> 39:14.909
- I can't... You're all talking over one another.
- Da, Da, Da...

39:14.911 --> 39:17.612
- I can't make head nor...
- She's literally with him right now.

39:17.614 --> 39:19.313
- Lookit.
- Da...

39:19.315 --> 39:20.982
I have to go here.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.917
I'll find Colin,
with or without Pixie.

39:22.919 --> 39:25.119
I'll let you know
when I have something.

39:36.266 --> 39:38.066
What a fucking day.

39:46.109 --> 39:48.076
Got a girlfriend
at the moment, Harland?

39:48.078 --> 39:51.279
- It's, uh, complicated.
- Complicated?

39:51.281 --> 39:53.614
Sinead hasn't texted you
in a month, man.

39:53.616 --> 39:55.283
Her uncle's poorly.

39:55.285 --> 39:57.919
Look, at school,
I'll admit,

39:57.921 --> 40:00.722
Frank did a little better
than me with the ladies.

40:00.724 --> 40:03.091
See, Harland was good,
right?

40:03.093 --> 40:05.860
The kind of guy
you take home to your gran.

40:05.862 --> 40:08.262
He lacked a little
killer instinct.

40:08.264 --> 40:10.331
- Look, will you just let me finish?
- Here we go.

40:10.333 --> 40:13.501
I've actually had a proper
girlfriend on two occasions.

40:13.503 --> 40:15.103
You always go on
about that.

40:15.105 --> 40:18.239
Just because my taste
is a little bit more exotic.

40:18.241 --> 40:19.941
Exotic? Yeah?

40:19.943 --> 40:22.276
Yeah, you know,
white sand beach,

40:22.278 --> 40:25.179
olive skin,
piña colada in hand.

40:25.181 --> 40:27.548
Sean Paul over here.

40:27.550 --> 40:30.284
Frank, if you were so
keen on getting out,

40:30.286 --> 40:32.653
why are you still living in the
caravan park your father owns?

40:32.655 --> 40:36.023
He gets 500 yards away from his
pops, and he cacks it.

40:36.025 --> 40:38.059
That's obviously a lie.

40:38.061 --> 40:40.094
I've actually spent some time
in Dublin, so...

40:40.096 --> 40:42.296
To look at
universities.

40:42.298 --> 40:45.466
Look, Harland has many
fantastic qualities.

40:45.468 --> 40:48.102
I mean, he's loyal,
he's dependable.

40:48.104 --> 40:50.371
- Suspiciously close to his mother.
- What?

40:50.373 --> 40:54.075
He's my best mate.
But you and I,

40:54.077 --> 40:56.677
we see things
a little differently.

40:56.679 --> 40:58.713
We get it.

40:58.715 --> 41:00.548
- Oh, we get it?
- Yeah.

41:00.550 --> 41:02.450
Do we?

41:06.356 --> 41:09.590
Ah, I love this song.
My mam used to sing it.

41:09.592 --> 41:12.059
I have a recording
of it at home.

41:12.061 --> 41:13.628
- Was she good, your ma?
- Yeah.

41:13.630 --> 41:16.464
Well, the <i>Wexford Bugle</i>
once described her as having

41:16.466 --> 41:18.800
"the voice with the husk
of Kim Carnes

41:18.802 --> 41:21.235
and the tenderness
of summer rain," so...

41:52.101 --> 41:55.803
- What was it like?
- What?

41:55.805 --> 41:57.905
You know, last night.

41:57.907 --> 42:00.541
Two 99s
and one of those, please.

42:00.543 --> 42:02.677
Oh, that.

42:02.679 --> 42:06.280
It was, you know,
pretty mental.

42:06.282 --> 42:07.615
Really?

42:07.617 --> 42:09.283
Oh, yeah.

42:09.285 --> 42:10.985
Shit.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.954
Was she your sensei?

42:12.956 --> 42:14.689
What the fuck's
a sensei?

42:14.691 --> 42:19.393
It's a martial art term.
A master. A teacher, like.

42:19.395 --> 42:22.463
- I can handle myself, thank you very much.
- Oh, don't be so defensive.

42:22.465 --> 42:25.433
All men need a sensei at one
point or another, you know.

42:25.435 --> 42:28.469
- Show them the tricks of the trade.
- Well, who was yours?

42:28.471 --> 42:30.438
Well, I haven't
met mine yet.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.607
Oh, that's a shame.
You weirdo.

42:34.611 --> 42:39.413
Apparently women have 8,000 sensitive
nerve endings in their clitoris.

42:39.415 --> 42:41.682
- Could that be true?
- What are you lads talking about?

42:41.684 --> 42:44.552
Nothing. Uh, sheep.

42:44.554 --> 42:46.220
Sheep?

42:46.222 --> 42:49.223
Yeah, Harland used to go
to the sheep trials

42:49.225 --> 42:50.725
with your dad,
didn't you?

42:50.727 --> 42:54.495
Yeah, Dad, um,
he loved sheep.

42:54.497 --> 42:56.731
"They're gorgeous creatures,"
he'd say.

42:56.733 --> 42:58.132
Hmm.

43:00.069 --> 43:02.203
It's true, you know.

43:02.205 --> 43:05.273
It's round about
the 8,000 mark.

43:06.042 --> 43:07.909
Here's your Solero.

43:08.478 --> 43:11.479
- Here.
- Thanks.

43:55.892 --> 43:59.093
Does he always take life
so seriously?

43:59.095 --> 44:02.229
Tends to. I do my best
to lighten him up a bit.

44:02.231 --> 44:04.298
I'm not saying it
in a bad way.

44:04.300 --> 44:06.434
I think it's quite
endearing.

44:06.436 --> 44:09.603
- Endearing?
- Yeah, there's something sweet about him.

44:12.375 --> 44:14.542
You guys want anything
from the shop?

44:14.544 --> 44:16.477
You want some company?

44:16.479 --> 44:18.145
Sure.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.053
Sweet?

44:37.433 --> 44:40.167
- Beautiful day, isn't it?
- Sure is.

44:41.270 --> 44:43.004
- Do you mind if I...
- Yes.

44:43.006 --> 44:44.505
Thanks.

44:49.679 --> 44:52.413
- Are you with your dad?
- Uh, no, I'm waiting for my priest.

44:52.415 --> 44:54.415
Father O'Shaughnessy.

44:54.417 --> 44:56.117
Oh, right.

44:57.854 --> 45:00.654
- There's no funny business going on?
- I'm sorry?

45:00.656 --> 45:04.158
You can tell me
if there's any funny business.

45:05.261 --> 45:08.195
Oh. No.
He's... He's a good man.

45:10.867 --> 45:14.402
Wouldn't you rather be out with your
mates, playing football and chasing girls?

45:14.404 --> 45:17.972
- It's a Saturday, you know.
- I'm married to the Lord.

45:17.974 --> 45:20.775
He gives me
everything I need.

45:20.777 --> 45:22.476
Everything?

45:24.547 --> 45:27.648
Well, and tell me if I'm
overstepping the mark here,

45:27.650 --> 45:32.686
but... don't you wanna know
what it's like?

45:34.657 --> 45:37.691
Oh... Oh... "It."

45:39.929 --> 45:41.429
Uh...

45:42.398 --> 45:44.565
I watch videos, so...

45:48.037 --> 45:49.737
Sorry.

45:56.946 --> 45:58.412
Huh?

46:03.619 --> 46:05.186
Huh? Eh?

46:06.989 --> 46:10.224
- How are we getting on over there?
- Just looking.

46:10.226 --> 46:13.461
Can I help you with anything
there, sweetheart?

46:14.764 --> 46:16.831
You're so nice.

46:16.833 --> 46:20.234
I want some tequila,
but I can't seem to find the one I like.

46:20.236 --> 46:22.837
Oh, yeah? And, uh,
which one would that be, now?

46:22.839 --> 46:25.473
All I can see here is <i>aٌejo,</i>
and I usually drink <i>reposado.</i>

46:25.475 --> 46:28.809
<i>Reposado.</i>

46:30.947 --> 46:33.914
Did you know that
it wasn't until the Spanish

46:33.916 --> 46:37.384
invaded the Aztecs in the 16th century
that tequila was actually invented?

46:37.386 --> 46:40.454
I didn't know that, no.

46:40.456 --> 46:43.757
Well, you see,
the Spanish loved their brandy.

46:43.759 --> 46:46.560
But their supplies
began to run low,

46:46.562 --> 46:50.564
forcing the tired and parched
soldiers to improvise.

46:50.566 --> 46:53.901
They started by distilling
mud and agave,

46:53.903 --> 46:55.536
which, although basic,

46:55.538 --> 46:58.105
was how tequila
was initially invented.

46:58.107 --> 47:00.841
You've got brains too.

47:00.843 --> 47:04.979
Do you know what they also invented
during the Spanish invasion?

47:04.981 --> 47:06.447
Huh?

47:07.717 --> 47:10.484
- The 69.
- Oh, Jesus.

47:10.486 --> 47:12.153
I, um...

47:13.022 --> 47:14.788
I thought
that was the French.

47:15.458 --> 47:17.691
Maybe I'm wrong.

47:20.930 --> 47:22.830
Anyway, we'd best be
out of your hair.

47:22.832 --> 47:25.366
I can make an exception
for you, darlin'.

47:26.202 --> 47:28.736
I can look
in the back.

47:28.738 --> 47:32.640
- Can you keep the till hot for me?
- Don't you worry about that.

47:36.913 --> 47:39.246
You slimy old nut bag.

47:39.248 --> 47:42.183
Is this
really necessary?

47:42.185 --> 47:46.387
- What the hell are you doing?
- Where's your sense of fun? Quick, grab the tequila.

47:46.389 --> 47:48.222
No, no, no! I'm not taking
any part in this.

47:48.224 --> 47:49.890
- Suit yourself.
- Pixie!

47:49.892 --> 47:51.492
Come on.

47:51.494 --> 47:53.494
Frank!
We gotta be moving!

47:53.496 --> 47:55.729
- Now!
- Just a second.

48:00.069 --> 48:02.770
I'll leave you with this.

48:02.772 --> 48:05.472
If God didn't want
you and I eating pussy,

48:05.474 --> 48:08.375
why did he go and make them
look like a taco?

48:09.579 --> 48:11.879
- Quickly, Frank. Jesus.
- I'm coming!

48:16.752 --> 48:18.219
Hey!

48:18.221 --> 48:19.853
Come back!

48:19.855 --> 48:21.689
What the hell's going on?
Where'd you get that money?

48:21.691 --> 48:24.225
Where do you think?
This nut job robbed the place.

48:24.227 --> 48:27.461
It just dawned on me that I was the
only one not doing anything illegal,

48:27.463 --> 48:29.230
meaning I was just
sort of on the run.

48:29.232 --> 48:30.598
I wanted to be really
part of it, you know.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.299
That cannot honestly
be your logic.

48:32.301 --> 48:33.767
And I wanted to stay
in a fancy hotel,

48:33.769 --> 48:35.903
have a steak dinner and drink
tequila, that too.

48:35.905 --> 48:38.872
- Aren't we about to make a ton of money?
- I like to pay my own way.

48:38.874 --> 48:41.041
You're just a little
round the bend, aren't you?

48:41.043 --> 48:43.978
I'd like to remind the two of youse
that this isn't a bloody holiday.

48:43.980 --> 48:46.614
I don't know about you,
but selling a boatload of MDMA

48:46.616 --> 48:49.450
to a gangster in Dingle,
with a rotting corpse in the boot,

48:49.452 --> 48:51.552
isn't exactly Paris
in the fucking rain.

48:51.554 --> 48:53.787
Listen here,
old buddy, old pal.

48:53.789 --> 48:57.224
I've been telling you for years
I'm a wild man, all right?

48:57.226 --> 48:58.826
I can't be caged.

48:58.828 --> 49:01.161
The sooner you get your head
round to that fact, the better.

49:01.163 --> 49:04.231
I tell you what.
There's no two people I'd rather be with,

49:04.233 --> 49:07.868
travelling down the coast with a
boatload of MDMA and a rotting corpse,

49:07.870 --> 49:09.470
than the two of youse.

49:09.472 --> 49:11.672
Beautifully put,
Frank.

49:11.674 --> 49:13.274
I give up.

49:50.212 --> 49:52.146
So what's the game plan?

49:52.148 --> 49:54.481
It's Daniel's uncle.
We don't need no game plan.

49:54.483 --> 49:56.950
Yeah, wait. Why?
Do we need a game plan?

49:56.952 --> 49:58.886
These things have a tendency not
to be the most straightforward.

49:58.888 --> 50:00.487
I thought we were
thinking of this

50:00.489 --> 50:02.623
as a friend of the family
sort of thing, right?

50:02.625 --> 50:04.758
Exactly. He's just
a friend of the family

50:04.760 --> 50:07.828
who's gonna help us
out of our situation.

50:07.830 --> 50:10.097
Don't be giving us
the bad vibes.

50:10.099 --> 50:13.400
We drop Daniel's name.
He'll probably be expecting us.

50:13.402 --> 50:16.270
We'll just be honest.
All we're looking for is a fair deal.

50:16.272 --> 50:19.640
We're not gonna hold anyone
to ransom. It's a win-win.

50:19.642 --> 50:22.009
See? Everybody's
a bloody winner.

50:31.354 --> 50:34.054
Jesus Christ.

50:44.600 --> 50:47.968
Uh, we're looking
for Mr Raymond Donnelly.

50:47.970 --> 50:51.805
I know. And the ducks,
they're so beautiful.

50:51.807 --> 50:55.008
Yeah, I know
what they're like.

50:55.010 --> 50:57.578
Yeah, I know.

50:57.580 --> 50:59.913
I know. And then it comes
from underneath.

50:59.915 --> 51:03.183
They had to pull them out
with motorcycle chains.

51:03.185 --> 51:07.121
Hang on, Jim. I got Harry,
Ron and Hermione looking at me.

51:07.123 --> 51:10.624
I'll have to call you back.
Bye-bye. Who the fuck are you?

51:10.626 --> 51:14.628
Daniel sent us.
Your nephew. We're mates.

51:14.630 --> 51:18.766
Oh. So, this is nice.

51:18.768 --> 51:21.802
We've got a business
proposition for you.

51:21.804 --> 51:26.106
It's more of an opportunity.
A business opportunity.

51:26.108 --> 51:30.711
Marilou, some refreshment, maybe,
for our young entrepreneurs.

51:30.713 --> 51:32.146
Almond milk latte
would be grand.

51:32.148 --> 51:35.482
Oh, you got a sense of humour.
I like that.

51:36.886 --> 51:40.554
The fish out there, is that to,
you know, to conceal the smell?

51:42.825 --> 51:44.658
You should be on quiz shows
or something.

51:44.660 --> 51:47.628
So we got the comedian and the genius.
What do you bring to the table?

51:47.630 --> 51:49.963
Energy
and a positive attitude.

51:49.965 --> 51:52.699
Ah, lovely.
What the fuck do you want?

51:52.701 --> 51:55.135
We, uh, need
your help with...

51:55.137 --> 51:58.505
Not your help so much
as we'd like to help you.

51:58.507 --> 52:00.808
Us helping you help us.

52:00.810 --> 52:03.043
Before nightfall, lads.

52:03.045 --> 52:04.945
We've got enough MDMA
to break the jaw

52:04.947 --> 52:07.815
of any fella who comes through
this town for the next 30 years.

52:11.187 --> 52:13.921
Okay. Let's see it.

52:21.931 --> 52:23.197
Marilou?

52:44.987 --> 52:46.186
Mm.

52:48.257 --> 52:49.923
That's 15 kilos there.

52:51.760 --> 52:54.094
Is that all of it? I mean,
is there more in the car?

52:54.096 --> 52:56.830
- Is there any stashed somewhere?
- Nope. That's all of it.

52:56.832 --> 52:58.999
Not even a dab's worth
left for later.

53:00.870 --> 53:02.870
And, um,

53:02.872 --> 53:05.606
what are you, uh,
carrying, lads?

53:07.309 --> 53:09.042
Carrying?

53:11.380 --> 53:15.182
No. Uh, we wanted to be straight with
you, Mr Donnelly.

53:15.184 --> 53:16.617
No... No funny business.

53:16.619 --> 53:19.653
- You're Daniel's uncle, after all.
- Yeah.

53:19.655 --> 53:22.923
Okay, so to be totally clear,
you've come in with the bag of drugs,

53:22.925 --> 53:26.360
and you guys just want
80 or 100 grand...

53:26.362 --> 53:29.596
It actually has a street
value of nearly a million.

53:31.133 --> 53:32.933
Oh, does it?
Does it?

53:32.935 --> 53:35.502
I wonder what the street value
of your head in a bag

53:35.504 --> 53:37.137
with your dick
in your mouth would be.

53:37.139 --> 53:39.540
I'd say about ninepence.

53:41.010 --> 53:44.711
I'm a drug dealer.
I don't do handouts, okay?

53:44.713 --> 53:46.246
Especially not to three
kids who look like

53:46.248 --> 53:48.315
they've just walked in
off an afternoon special.

53:48.317 --> 53:51.552
- But that's not fair.
- Did that not sound kind of stupid in your head?

53:51.554 --> 53:54.621
It does coming out of your mouth.
Marilou, show them.

54:05.434 --> 54:08.368
Welcome to unfair.

54:08.370 --> 54:09.770
Let's be moving.

54:09.772 --> 54:11.672
- Fuck!
- Harland, do something!

54:11.674 --> 54:14.441
- Madam, put the gun down, please.
- Harland!

54:14.443 --> 54:16.143
I'm so sorry.

54:16.145 --> 54:17.644
- Fuck!
- Ow!

54:26.956 --> 54:29.289
- Oh, my wrist!
- I'll drive.

54:30.059 --> 54:31.625
Come on!

54:31.627 --> 54:33.260
Keys, keys!

54:46.942 --> 54:49.076
Well, Jesus,
that went well.

54:49.078 --> 54:53.513
Don't even start. Daniel it
was your idea. I told you this was crazy.

54:53.515 --> 54:57.250
That was a collective decision.
Don't you be blaming me, Harland.

54:58.754 --> 55:00.387
So,
what do we do now?

55:00.389 --> 55:02.823
I don't know.
Here, pass me the tequila.

55:02.825 --> 55:05.058
I say we get pissed,
you know?

55:05.060 --> 55:08.228
Really fucking pissed, and then
just, you know, hope for the best.

55:08.230 --> 55:09.663
Good plan.

55:09.665 --> 55:12.966
Mm. Real crack team
we've got here.

55:13.936 --> 55:16.036
You are never
driving my car again.

55:16.038 --> 55:17.871
Ah, just pass me
the tequila.

55:22.811 --> 55:24.978
So this all
comes back to you?

55:24.980 --> 55:27.247
Is that why that fella
was knocking on your door?

55:27.249 --> 55:28.882
It's complicated.

55:28.884 --> 55:33.453
You see, I had hatched a plan with
the aid of this other fella, Fergus.

55:33.455 --> 55:35.322
I got Fergus to dupe Colin,

55:35.324 --> 55:38.959
the man currently disintegrating
in the back of your Mercedes there,

55:38.961 --> 55:40.894
into intercepting one
of McGrath's drug deals.

55:40.896 --> 55:43.930
Then Fergus was to dispose of Colin
and come meet me at the airport.

55:43.932 --> 55:45.499
You're like an evil
mastermind.

55:45.501 --> 55:48.001
I've got complex
family issues.

55:48.003 --> 55:51.905
So this Fergus fella,
you didn't love him, then?

55:53.175 --> 55:55.976
Well, truth is,

55:55.978 --> 55:59.212
I feel terrible saying it,
but what Fergus didn't know

55:59.214 --> 56:01.581
was that I planned to take
that flight to San Francisco

56:01.583 --> 56:03.784
with the money
but without him.

56:03.786 --> 56:05.118
Jesus.

56:05.120 --> 56:06.953
A little cold,
don't you think?

56:06.955 --> 56:08.388
Don't be going all soft.

56:08.390 --> 56:11.291
I take it you're not
the romantic type, then.

56:11.293 --> 56:14.594
Yeah. Once.

56:14.596 --> 56:17.864
He was called Gareth.
Shy boy.

56:17.866 --> 56:20.267
- He from Sligo?
- Castlebar.

56:20.269 --> 56:24.504
Uh, he's...
He's McGrath's nephew, actually.

56:24.506 --> 56:28.642
You fell in love with the deadly
gangster priest's nephew?

56:28.644 --> 56:30.677
I know, I know.

56:30.679 --> 56:33.680
It was all very
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

56:33.682 --> 56:35.449
What happened?

56:36.952 --> 56:39.119
McGrath told him
he could no longer see me,

56:39.121 --> 56:41.855
and he listened to his head
instead of his heart.

56:41.857 --> 56:44.024
He was lovely but weak.

56:54.503 --> 56:58.271
I... am gonna go
for a swim.

56:58.273 --> 57:01.374
- Excellent idea.
- Oh, you must be mad. It'll be freezing.

57:03.045 --> 57:04.444
All that
gangster talk,

57:04.446 --> 57:06.413
and you're afraid
of a bit of cold water.

57:06.415 --> 57:09.216
Oh, you think I'm gonna give in
to a bit of schoolboy teasing?

57:09.218 --> 57:10.917
Suit yourself.

57:14.690 --> 57:16.423
All right, you morons,
wait up.

57:16.425 --> 57:18.925
Well, come on, then.
I'm already freezing my nuts off.

57:18.927 --> 57:22.229
She best not see our little
fellas when we get out.

57:44.920 --> 57:47.687
Come on!

57:59.668 --> 58:01.201
I've got a question.

58:01.203 --> 58:03.804
You have
endless questions.

58:03.806 --> 58:06.139
- Why did you sleep with him?
- Oi!

58:06.141 --> 58:09.376
Have you been telling
little white lies, Frankie?

58:10.212 --> 58:11.978
Honestly,
I didn't say that.

58:11.980 --> 58:13.647
Sounds to me like you did.

58:13.649 --> 58:16.049
Showing off, was he?
Playing Little Billy Big Bollocks?

58:16.051 --> 58:18.185
It wasn't like that.
I was just, you know...

58:18.187 --> 58:21.621
Shut up. Both of you,
sit on that bed.

58:21.623 --> 58:23.690
Go on.

58:23.692 --> 58:25.392
I wanna show you
something.

58:27.496 --> 58:29.329
- Thanks.
- What?

58:35.904 --> 58:39.573
First off, it's neither of yours business
who I choose to sleep with, okay?

58:39.575 --> 58:42.843
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Yes, you did. And Frank...

58:42.845 --> 58:45.545
I'm sorry. It was stupid.

58:45.547 --> 58:48.849
Freud would have a field day
with the two of you.

58:48.851 --> 58:50.483
What?

01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:02.382
See?

01:01:02.384 --> 01:01:05.018
The two of youse
are made for each other.

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:09.222
Sorry I'm late. Had to run a
couple of errands on the way.

01:01:09.224 --> 01:01:11.491
Seamus, you saved me!

01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:13.493
Don't fucking move.

01:01:14.563 --> 01:01:15.996
On the floor.

01:01:16.898 --> 01:01:18.531
The lot of you!

01:01:18.533 --> 01:01:21.234
- Look, we haven't done anything.
- Shut up, you.

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:24.170
Here, Pix.

01:01:24.172 --> 01:01:25.972
Put them on.

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:27.540
Put 'em on!

01:01:30.612 --> 01:01:32.078
Where's Colin?

01:01:33.415 --> 01:01:35.482
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:38.318
Pix, now, don't be messing me about.
Where the fuck is Colin?

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.489
I promise. We broke up months ago.
Did Mick send you?

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.034
Aye. Right.

01:01:54.036 --> 01:01:57.270
Up. We're going
for a drive.

01:01:58.473 --> 01:02:00.106
Come on!

01:02:01.276 --> 01:02:04.010
Do you want me to send you
a fucking telegram?

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:05.545
Let's go!

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:26.566
Do you have to, you know,
press it so hard against him?

01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:29.269
Eyes forward, now,
like a good boy.

01:02:31.606 --> 01:02:34.674
All I'm saying is,
your gun could be a couple of inches away.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:37.444
Okay.

01:02:51.526 --> 01:02:53.493
Look, if you just
please listen!

01:02:53.495 --> 01:02:55.128
We didn't
mean to get involved.

01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:56.729
Since you're friends
of Pixie,

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:59.399
I'm affording you a quick
death and a proper burial.

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:01.768
Don't push your luck,

01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:05.138
'cause believe you me,
you don't want things to turn unpleasant.

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:11.544
Fucking idiot.

01:03:20.155 --> 01:03:22.188
We've got to tell him.

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:23.857
Just keep quiet.

01:03:23.859 --> 01:03:26.593
Oh, we're digging our own
graves, for fuck's sake.

01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:29.229
Time isn't exactly
on our side.

01:03:30.265 --> 01:03:31.764
She's got a plan.
I know it.

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:35.201
What, and you think
it involves us?

01:03:36.438 --> 01:03:38.771
- We lied to you.
- Harland!

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:41.508
No, fuck it, Frank.
This has gone on way too far.

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:44.377
Sir, he's in the boot
of the car.

01:03:47.015 --> 01:03:49.382
- I'm sorry?
- He's in the boot.

01:03:50.318 --> 01:03:52.986
- In the boot?
- He's in the boot of the car.

01:03:52.988 --> 01:03:56.356
- In the boot of this car here?
- Yes, he's in the boot of that fucking car.

01:03:56.358 --> 01:03:58.658
- Oh, that's a good one.
- We're not pros, man.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.426
We didn't know
what the fuck we were doing.

01:04:00.428 --> 01:04:02.495
He's in the boot
of the fucking car.

01:04:02.497 --> 01:04:05.965
Oh, that's good!
That's a good one.

01:04:08.403 --> 01:04:10.270
I'm still gonna
have to kill youse.

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:20.580
Fuck!
You fucking bastard!

01:04:20.582 --> 01:04:23.850
You fucking bastard.

01:04:30.358 --> 01:04:31.958
You didn't take
his gun?

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:34.260
I thought he was dead.
What was I supposed to do with it?

01:04:34.262 --> 01:04:35.962
Quick, uncuff me.

01:04:44.105 --> 01:04:47.240
Youse two finish the marvellous job
you were doing digging those graves.

01:04:47.242 --> 01:04:51.211
- But they're not dead.
- We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, shall we?

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.646
In your own time.

01:04:56.318 --> 01:04:59.219
Aren't you happy
to see me?

01:05:04.092 --> 01:05:06.326
What was that,
angel?

01:05:09.297 --> 01:05:11.965
- Whore.
- Ah, that's sweet.

01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:16.669
Went and messed everything
up, didn't you?

01:05:16.671 --> 01:05:19.539
I was gonna start a new life
for myself in San Francisco

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:22.742
until you had to go and get
all jealous over poor Fergus.

01:05:26.181 --> 01:05:28.281
Not in the mood
for chatting?

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.750
Okay, well,

01:05:30.752 --> 01:05:33.086
I'm gonna tell you
a little bedtime story.

01:05:33.088 --> 01:05:34.921
How would you like that?

01:05:36.591 --> 01:05:38.992
I'm gonna take you back
four years.

01:05:38.994 --> 01:05:43.363
It was a cold October day
in our little home town.

01:05:49.371 --> 01:05:51.671
<i>It was the 18th,
to be precise.</i>

01:05:51.673 --> 01:05:56.476
<i>The 18th of October.
A day I won't easily forget.</i>

01:05:56.478 --> 01:06:00.346
<i>I'm going to visit my mam,
who had stage-four cancer of the throat.</i>

01:06:00.348 --> 01:06:02.882
<i>But I had just been told the
good news that the chemicals</i>

01:06:02.884 --> 01:06:06.286
<i>they had been pumping into
her body were taking hold.</i>

01:06:06.288 --> 01:06:09.289
<i>It looked like she was going to beat
it, and I have to tell you,</i>

01:06:09.291 --> 01:06:11.024
<i>I was feeling
positively hopeful.</i>

01:06:11.026 --> 01:06:12.358
Hey.

01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:18.398
<i>So you can imagine my shock when I see
a strange figure appear from her room.</i>

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:22.335
Hey!

01:06:24.306 --> 01:06:26.039
Hey!

01:06:28.343 --> 01:06:30.810
<i>The first thing you hear
is the sound.</i>

01:06:34.215 --> 01:06:35.615
Mam!

01:06:37.218 --> 01:06:38.618
Mam!

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.353
<i>I know she'd have
fought like hell.</i>

01:06:40.355 --> 01:06:42.021
Help! Help!

01:06:42.023 --> 01:06:43.923
<i>But she was weak.</i>

01:06:47.095 --> 01:06:49.962
She's not breathing.

01:06:54.936 --> 01:06:57.737
<i>No one believed me
that she'd been suffocated.</i>

01:06:57.739 --> 01:07:00.039
<i>They thought
she'd just given up.</i>

01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:03.476
<i>But I had the good sense to
go back to the visitors' book.</i>

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:07.080
<i>That name,
Jeremy Fisher,</i>

01:07:07.082 --> 01:07:09.449
<i>haunted me for three years.</i>

01:07:10.952 --> 01:07:13.553
Want to know
how you gave it away?

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:20.026
<i>We were lying in bed,
having just watched a movie.</i>

01:07:20.028 --> 01:07:21.828
I'm gonna tinkle.

01:07:23.064 --> 01:07:24.697
Back in a sec.

01:07:28.536 --> 01:07:32.071
<i>If only you'd replaced the loo
roll, you would've got away with it.</i>

01:07:55.096 --> 01:07:56.896
So I knew.

01:07:56.898 --> 01:08:02.034
Still, I decided just to
run away from all of it.

01:08:04.639 --> 01:08:06.939
But you had to
ruin that too.

01:08:11.346 --> 01:08:13.446
One question:

01:08:14.949 --> 01:08:16.482
Why?

01:08:22.424 --> 01:08:25.057
He p... He paid me.

01:08:29.363 --> 01:08:30.796
Who?

01:08:33.368 --> 01:08:34.901
You know who.

01:08:46.948 --> 01:08:49.048
I loved you.

01:08:52.287 --> 01:08:54.821
Oh, baby. Oh, baby.

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:01.560
And I almost
loved you too.

01:09:45.874 --> 01:09:48.006
I think this one's gone.

01:09:58.853 --> 01:10:01.120
Let's just bury
the both of them.

01:10:01.122 --> 01:10:04.824
What about him?
He's still breathing.

01:10:27.448 --> 01:10:30.516
Now let's get these fellas
in the ground sharpish.

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:31.884
My instincts
are telling me

01:10:31.886 --> 01:10:34.287
we'd better be getting
our skedaddle on.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.256
Chip-chop.

01:10:39.494 --> 01:10:40.993
Where are you going now?

01:10:40.995 --> 01:10:44.063
I don't like burials much.
I'll be back in two.

01:10:50.305 --> 01:10:51.837
- You got him?
- Yeah.

01:10:51.839 --> 01:10:55.308
- Shit.
- Oh, there's blood all over my T-shirt now.

01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:56.809
Oh, Jesus.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:03.115
Jesus.
I don't like blood.

01:11:12.493 --> 01:11:14.126
Hey, it's me.

01:11:28.943 --> 01:11:30.209
Come on.

01:11:31.145 --> 01:11:33.245
Let's get going.

01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:35.014
Where to?

01:11:35.016 --> 01:11:37.883
There's this church down near Clonakilty.
Apparently, it's beautiful.

01:11:37.885 --> 01:11:39.785
Shouldn't we be getting
the hell out of here?

01:11:39.787 --> 01:11:43.022
First off, I think we should all keep
in mind that these sorts of adventures

01:11:43.024 --> 01:11:45.024
are always more enjoyable
with a positive attitude.

01:11:45.026 --> 01:11:47.893
And secondly,
we need to make some money

01:11:47.895 --> 01:11:49.929
and get out of this mess
so we can all run off

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:51.998
and play happy families
wherever the wind shall take us.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.900
My gust obviously being
toward Sam Clam's Disco.

01:11:57.772 --> 01:11:59.372
San Francisco.

01:12:00.608 --> 01:12:02.241
Tell me if I'm jumping
hurdles here,

01:12:02.243 --> 01:12:04.744
but is your plan to try
and sell the drugs

01:12:04.746 --> 01:12:07.913
back to the gangsters who are
missing them in the first place?

01:12:07.915 --> 01:12:10.850
- You're catching on.
- Are you out of your bloody mind?

01:12:10.852 --> 01:12:14.954
It's the only way to make a clean
break from all this malarkey, trust me.

01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:16.756
She's got a point,
you know.

01:12:16.758 --> 01:12:19.458
I don't wanna spend the rest of
my life looking over my shoulder

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.260
every time I see a priest.

01:12:23.531 --> 01:12:25.398
You know,
I was just thinking.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.634
You fellas were very nearly
each other's last kiss.

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:32.071
Would've been sort of
romantic, don't you think?

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:31.397
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

01:13:34.535 --> 01:13:36.769
All good children
go to heaven.

01:13:36.771 --> 01:13:39.171
- Amen.
- Gareth.

01:13:39.173 --> 01:13:41.841
Let us pray.

01:13:41.843 --> 01:13:45.444
Dear Lord,
please watch over our souls

01:13:45.446 --> 01:13:49.849
as we avenge the loss
of our fallen brothers.

01:13:49.851 --> 01:13:52.818
- And especially today...
- Thank you, Gareth.

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:54.320
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:13:54.322 --> 01:13:57.156
Brevity is the elixir
of life, young man.

01:13:57.158 --> 01:13:59.892
Right. Sister Geraghty,
Father Armstrong,

01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:02.061
you come with me.

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:04.964
The rest of you form a
perimeter round the church.

01:14:04.966 --> 01:14:08.901
No one gets out
before we do.

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:11.704
We know not what
the day brings forth,

01:14:11.706 --> 01:14:16.475
so may the Lord have mercy
on our souls.

01:14:16.944 --> 01:14:18.978
Amen.

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:21.981
Gareth, you'll keep watch.

01:14:21.983 --> 01:14:24.383
No, but, Uncle, you said
this morning that...

01:14:24.385 --> 01:14:26.085
Thank you, Gareth.

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:29.388
Thank you, Gareth.

01:14:33.294 --> 01:14:35.928
These guns aren't
gonna shoot themselves.

01:15:20.741 --> 01:15:22.675
Well, well, well.

01:15:22.677 --> 01:15:25.277
Playing little games,
are we, now?

01:15:25.279 --> 01:15:27.446
This is all
very charming.

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:33.252
<i>A little game
never hurt no one, Father.</i>

01:15:33.254 --> 01:15:35.487
Oh, I'll play
your game, child.

01:15:36.891 --> 01:15:39.558
<i>Place the cash
on the altar.</i>

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:42.661
I prefer to do my business
face to face,

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:44.697
with the Lord
as my witness.

01:15:44.699 --> 01:15:50.302
That may be, but I'm the one
offering the deal, aren't I?

01:15:51.806 --> 01:15:54.039
I'll have to call in
one of my men.

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:56.542
You do you, babe.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:00.846
Bring in the money.

01:16:00.848 --> 01:16:03.582
Bit of a cakewalk,
all this gangster stuff.

01:16:07.088 --> 01:16:09.622
The Lord sees all evil.

01:16:11.626 --> 01:16:13.893
Show yourselves now!

01:16:15.096 --> 01:16:19.064
Or in the name of the
Father, we'll sniff you out

01:16:19.066 --> 01:16:21.367
and bleed you slow.

01:16:29.343 --> 01:16:31.143
Come out!

01:16:32.146 --> 01:16:34.446
You fucking cowards!

01:16:36.851 --> 01:16:39.184
Spread out!

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.987
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

01:17:14.989 --> 01:17:18.390
Ye of little faith.
The cavalry is on its way.

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:56.495
The O'Briens.
It's the fucking O'Briens!

01:17:56.497 --> 01:17:59.064
Well, aren't you
quite the troublemaker?

01:17:59.066 --> 01:18:00.933
Why, thank you, Father.

01:18:00.935 --> 01:18:04.069
<i>Coming from you,
that's a real compliment.</i>

01:18:04.071 --> 01:18:08.173
Saddle up, boys.
We've got company.

01:18:39.707 --> 01:18:43.208
Aren't you a bit old
to be playing dress-up?

01:18:48.416 --> 01:18:51.550
What in God's name
are you doing here?

01:18:51.552 --> 01:18:54.286
I'd be asking you
the same question.

01:18:58.726 --> 01:19:01.193
A young woman called me.

01:19:02.063 --> 01:19:03.762
That little bitch!

01:19:03.764 --> 01:19:06.532
I ought to put a bullet
between your eyes!

01:19:06.534 --> 01:19:09.468
Come on, Pix!
Your game is up!

01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:10.669
Mickey!

01:19:10.671 --> 01:19:12.971
Your daughter, I presume.

01:19:12.973 --> 01:19:14.807
- Yeah.
- Oh!

01:19:14.809 --> 01:19:17.776
You must have your hands full
with those two.

01:19:17.778 --> 01:19:19.778
She is quite something.

01:19:21.115 --> 01:19:23.549
Yeah, that she is.

01:19:26.353 --> 01:19:29.021
Are we really
gonna do this?

01:19:29.023 --> 01:19:31.123
Break the peace
after all these years?

01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:32.991
I don't know.

01:19:32.993 --> 01:19:36.095
Part of me thinks we just walk out
of here with the money and the drugs,

01:19:36.097 --> 01:19:37.863
and you'll exterminate
yourselves

01:19:37.865 --> 01:19:41.366
back up in that shit-box town
you call home anyway.

01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:46.271
On the other hand, as we are in the
presence of our Lord and saviour,

01:19:46.273 --> 01:19:50.476
it might be fitting to just
gut you all here and now.

01:19:59.887 --> 01:20:03.755
Pixie,
any time is good for me.

01:21:55.436 --> 01:21:57.669
Sorry.
You can't go in there.

01:21:57.671 --> 01:21:59.204
Why not?

01:21:59.206 --> 01:22:02.908
Well, if you listen closely,
there's a shoot-out going on.

01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:04.776
Ah. Right.

01:22:06.647 --> 01:22:08.647
Why are you out here, then?

01:22:08.649 --> 01:22:12.384
Can't participate in shoot-outs until
you've completed your junior cert.

01:22:12.386 --> 01:22:14.653
Makes sense.

01:22:16.023 --> 01:22:18.290
- Smoke?
- Yeah.

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:21.893
Time to slip away.

01:22:40.147 --> 01:22:42.414
You ready to join
your mother?

01:22:44.051 --> 01:22:45.917
- Pixie!
- Gareth!

01:22:51.325 --> 01:22:54.893
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
Don't do anything stupid, now.

01:22:54.895 --> 01:22:56.862
- We're family.
- You hated her that much?

01:22:56.864 --> 01:22:59.798
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I know you did it.

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.367
I know you got Colin
to do it. Why?

01:23:04.171 --> 01:23:05.971
You took my father
away from me.

01:23:07.608 --> 01:23:09.641
You ruined him.
You made him weak.

01:23:09.643 --> 01:23:13.178
The two of youse, with your
whoring, manipulative ways.

01:23:17.918 --> 01:23:19.751
No. Please.

01:23:20.521 --> 01:23:22.988
Please don't. Please.

01:23:25.926 --> 01:23:27.926
Oh, you're not worth
the bullets.

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:33.632
Well, maybe one.

01:23:45.245 --> 01:23:46.845
Pixie.

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:01.960
Pixie.

01:24:06.633 --> 01:24:09.067
What's your
favourite prayer?

01:24:12.339 --> 01:24:16.074
Fuck, Da. Da.
Boys, help.

01:24:18.912 --> 01:24:20.979
Jesus. Sorry, Da.

01:24:21.548 --> 01:24:23.582
Careful. Careful.

01:24:24.985 --> 01:24:26.718
Let's have a look.

01:24:31.592 --> 01:24:33.358
- It's just a flesh wound.
- Yeah?

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.093
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah?

01:24:35.095 --> 01:24:36.762
You did good.

01:24:36.764 --> 01:24:39.331
- Me mam would be proud of you.
- You think?

01:24:39.333 --> 01:24:43.135
Well, it's fair to say you bailed
me out of a pretty sticky situation.

01:24:43.137 --> 01:24:47.105
You're your mother's
daughter, all right.

01:24:47.107 --> 01:24:48.907
I love you, Da.

01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:51.943
Da, are you okay?

01:24:51.945 --> 01:24:54.045
I'll be okay.
I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

01:24:54.047 --> 01:24:56.748
Now, listen, you.
You get out of here.

01:25:01.522 --> 01:25:04.589
You look after yourself.
Stay away from silly boys.

01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:08.160
Pix, we gotta go.

01:25:11.532 --> 01:25:14.633
- Summer, don't be poking at it.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:25:14.635 --> 01:25:17.102
- Jesus. Don't...
- Sorry.

01:25:17.104 --> 01:25:18.937
Come on.

01:25:18.939 --> 01:25:21.773
- I won't be a second.
- Harland!

01:26:02.349 --> 01:26:04.349
You fucking madman!

01:26:04.351 --> 01:26:06.585
- Yes!
- Jesus, Harland!

01:26:06.587 --> 01:26:08.820
Maybe I'm
a little wild too.

01:26:13.227 --> 01:26:14.960
Come on, let's go.

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.867
Ooh-hoo!

01:26:21.869 --> 01:26:24.903
Absolute cakewalk.
What did I tell you?

01:26:43.757 --> 01:26:48.793
<i>This is the final
call for Flight 162 to San Francisco.</i>

01:26:48.795 --> 01:26:53.298
<i>Final call for Flight 162
to San Francisco.</i>

01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:56.268
So, this is it, boys.

01:26:57.771 --> 01:26:59.938
Come on. Come here.

01:27:05.479 --> 01:27:08.313
Safe flight.

01:27:10.083 --> 01:27:13.652
My mam gave me this quote
when she was really sick, like.

01:27:13.654 --> 01:27:17.355
She said,
"Whatever you choose,

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:19.958
however many roads
you travel,

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.827
I hope that you choose
not to be a lady.

01:27:22.829 --> 01:27:25.030
I hope that you find some way
to break the rules

01:27:25.032 --> 01:27:27.666
and make a little
trouble out there.

01:27:27.668 --> 01:27:32.837
And I also hope that you choose to make
some of that trouble on behalf of women."

01:27:32.839 --> 01:27:35.740
I think we can safely say
that you, Pixie Hardy,

01:27:35.742 --> 01:27:38.310
have caused enough trouble
for a thousand women.

01:27:38.312 --> 01:27:40.278
I was hoping for a million.

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.747
Trouble.
Serious trouble.

01:27:48.255 --> 01:27:51.089
- So where you wanna go?
- I don't know.

01:27:51.091 --> 01:27:53.291
Somewhere exotic.

01:27:53.293 --> 01:27:58.129
I was thinking about uni, like.
Maybe get my degree.

01:27:58.131 --> 01:27:59.698
Back home?

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:02.033
Dublin? London?

01:28:04.771 --> 01:28:07.005
Right. Okay.

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:10.342
Shall we take
one more look at it?

01:28:10.344 --> 01:28:12.010
Yeah.

01:28:17.284 --> 01:28:19.951
- What? Where's the money?
- You've gotta be kidding me.

01:28:21.288 --> 01:28:23.955
Pixie! Pixie?

01:28:24.424 --> 01:28:26.157
Pixie?

01:28:28.695 --> 01:28:30.662
Are you serious?

01:28:31.698 --> 01:28:33.398
Pixie!
