<i>- Take the apple, Mrs. Sherman!</i>

00:19.246 --> 00:21.714
- Reach out and take it. Take the apple.
<i>- Mr. Ryan.</i>

00:21.816 --> 00:23.521
Mr. Ryan, would you please
step back to your podium?

00:23.546 --> 00:24.607
She wouldn't take the apple.

00:24.685 --> 00:29.121
Which one of you Johnny Appledick shit
for brains came up with that bit?

00:29.223 --> 00:32.357
Hi, ma'am, I just arrived
here in Winter Blunderland.

00:32.460 --> 00:35.594
<i>He looked like Ike
Turner handing Tina a snack.</i>

00:35.696 --> 00:37.396
I think we've identified
the key problem,

00:37.498 --> 00:39.698
which is that Jonah does not
interact well with humans.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.501
No, I don't interact well
with hag-ass old bitches.

00:42.603 --> 00:45.871
Do you realize that you just
handed O'Brien New Hampshire

00:45.973 --> 00:48.774
chained to a radiator
with its twat shaved?

00:48.876 --> 00:50.876
- <i>I'm hanging up!</i>
- I'm sorry, Mom.

00:50.978 --> 00:52.778
You know what? On the positive side,

00:52.880 --> 00:56.448
now I can just try and concentrate
on our little family weekend.

00:56.550 --> 00:59.451
- Just us Meyers.
- Well, then why is Gary here?

00:59.553 --> 01:02.354
- I mean, no offense.
- <i>Gary's family, too.</i>

01:02.456 --> 01:03.231
Oh, thank you.

01:03.256 --> 01:05.581
I'm just really excited
to have this time

01:05.660 --> 01:09.161
for you and Dad and Monny to
get to know the real Marjorie.

01:09.263 --> 01:12.164
I mean, fun Marjorie, not just
Marjorie the Secret Service agent.

01:12.266 --> 01:15.134
<i>Oh, I'm excited to get
to know fun Marjorie, too.</i>

01:15.236 --> 01:16.802
When is she arriving?

01:19.507 --> 01:22.341
I'm just kidding. I'm just teasing.

01:23.878 --> 01:26.278
Whoo-hoo-hoo! The president is driving.

01:26.380 --> 01:28.480
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Look out.

01:28.582 --> 01:31.016
Bump. How about that?

01:31.118 --> 01:33.485
- Look!
- Dad! Monny!

01:33.587 --> 01:34.404
Kitty Cat!

01:34.429 --> 01:36.879
All right, so the Chinese
are gonna be here any minute.

01:36.957 --> 01:39.658
- Yeah.
- Beijing has demanded complete secrecy.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.395
So you're gonna have to keep Charles
Ponzi and pussyride away from me.

01:43.497 --> 01:45.764
We Meyers are very resourceful.

01:45.866 --> 01:48.834
You do know you're not really
a member of my family, right?

01:48.936 --> 01:50.069
- I do.
- Right.

01:51.272 --> 01:52.771
<i>What is that insanity</i>

01:52.873 --> 01:54.506
you're putting all
over the tree, Monica?

01:54.608 --> 01:58.577
Oh, this is my homemade
cranberry and popcorn tinsel

01:58.679 --> 02:00.879
- that I like to call...
- Popcornaments!

02:00.981 --> 02:02.748
Someone's been reading my blog.

02:02.850 --> 02:04.783
I just trademarked the word last week.

02:04.885 --> 02:07.252
It sounds delicious and it's adorable.

02:07.354 --> 02:08.654
So I'm gonna call it delorable.

02:08.756 --> 02:10.122
See? We can all do it.

02:10.223 --> 02:11.457
- Hey, Mom.
- Yes?

02:11.559 --> 02:13.125
I just wanted to let
you know that Marjorie

02:13.227 --> 02:15.627
is a raw food vegan and
she's turned me into one.

02:15.730 --> 02:18.163
Oh, so that's two things
she's turned you into.

02:18.265 --> 02:22.301
Yeah, we just thought maybe we could
have, like, a sham ham for Christmas.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.470
What is that, sweetie?
Is that like tofurkey?

02:24.572 --> 02:26.238
No, ma'am, tofurkey is cooked.

02:26.340 --> 02:29.174
This is a raw log made of
mushrooms and soaked walnuts.

02:29.276 --> 02:30.509
But it tastes like a ham?

02:30.611 --> 02:31.944
- Yeah, it's close.
- Not at all.

02:32.046 --> 02:33.846
We could all cut back
on our meat consum...

02:33.948 --> 02:35.781
I'm terribly sorry, Marjorie.

02:35.883 --> 02:37.683
- I thought you were Selina.
- That's okay, sir.

02:37.785 --> 02:39.017
People make that mistake constantly.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.186
How about you touch neither of us?

02:41.288 --> 02:44.356
Okay, I'm gonna go check on
that funky food order and...

02:44.458 --> 02:47.893
Mom, I wanted to ask you about something,
but I can just talk to Dad about it.

02:47.995 --> 02:49.261
He's better with money stuff.

02:49.363 --> 02:51.029
What money stuff?

02:51.132 --> 02:53.499
Well, it's just that
there's so much of it

02:53.601 --> 02:55.334
<i>that it's really tough to
know what to do with it.</i>

02:55.436 --> 02:57.469
Uncle George was saying that maybe
I should sell the Palm Beach house

02:57.571 --> 02:59.238
so that I could pay
off the estate taxes.

02:59.340 --> 03:03.242
Palm Beach house, honey? That
was my daddy's favorite house.

03:03.344 --> 03:06.478
Actually, Lee, right now is
a fantastic time to sell.

03:06.580 --> 03:09.581
And, Catherine, do you remember
that Brazil hotel chain?

03:09.683 --> 03:11.283
- What?
- <i>I told them about your veganism</i>

03:11.385 --> 03:14.253
and they decided to convert the
whole thing to an eco resort.

03:14.355 --> 03:16.989
- No, they didn't.
- I have a prospectus in my briefcase.

03:17.091 --> 03:19.892
I'll tell you what. I think we
should not talk about money

03:19.994 --> 03:23.061
during our sort of pre-Christmas
Christmas celebration.

03:23.164 --> 03:26.365
Catherine and Marjorie,
can you gals go outside

03:26.467 --> 03:28.534
and get some wood to start a fire?

03:28.636 --> 03:31.470
Ma'am, your daughter's dazzling
eyes can start a fire themselves.

03:31.572 --> 03:33.138
Okay, well, that's terrifying,

03:33.240 --> 03:35.607
but I actually do think we need
to get some wood from outside.

03:35.709 --> 03:38.477
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thanks. Gary, we got to go.

03:38.579 --> 03:41.213
Okay, are the Chinese here yet?

03:41.315 --> 03:43.015
Delayed on the road, ma'am.

03:43.117 --> 03:45.317
Presumably driving slowly and
not using their signals.

03:45.419 --> 03:47.519
Hey, any updates on Debralee's sonogram?

03:47.621 --> 03:49.421
Nothing. I'm going crazy.

03:49.523 --> 03:51.857
What do you got going
there, Depravey Crockett?

03:51.959 --> 03:54.359
You can't go in with a plan.
The knife tells you.

03:54.461 --> 03:56.061
Okay, so lay it on me, Ben.

03:56.163 --> 03:57.563
It's all been prenegotiated, ma'am.

03:57.665 --> 03:59.264
In exchange for you
lifting the sanctions,

03:59.366 --> 04:01.900
<i>China's agreed to build an
electronics plant in Ohio</i>

04:02.002 --> 04:04.336
and an engine assembly
plant in North Carolina.

04:04.438 --> 04:06.071
Okay, so we got North Carolina, Ohio.

04:06.173 --> 04:07.239
That's the presidency for me.

04:07.341 --> 04:08.974
And as per usual, we raised the issue

04:09.076 --> 04:11.810
of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen
Lama returning to Tibet.

04:11.912 --> 04:14.546
- Dalai Lama, I'm so sick of him.
- He's insufferable.

04:14.648 --> 04:16.615
Do we have a press release
ready to go, Mike?

04:16.716 --> 04:18.149
All I got to do is press send and we...

04:18.252 --> 04:20.319
actually, I do need to
spell-check this thing.

04:20.421 --> 04:22.754
Ma'am, Minna Häkkinen is through
security and headed this way.

04:22.857 --> 04:26.692
How is it that that Asperger salad
inserted herself into this situation?

04:26.794 --> 04:29.094
President Lu trusts her. Likes
what she did with the IMF.

04:29.196 --> 04:31.463
No, I'll tell you what he likes.
Nordic beav.

04:31.565 --> 04:33.298
Irresistible. Ooh!

04:33.400 --> 04:34.933
- <i>Shh.</i>
- What?

04:35.035 --> 04:37.135
- Oh, Minna!
- Selina.

04:37.238 --> 04:39.238
- Hello.
- Hello. I have not seen you

04:39.340 --> 04:41.540
since you failed to vote for
me to be head of the IMF.

04:41.642 --> 04:43.375
And, oh, you changed your hair.

04:43.477 --> 04:44.943
Thank you, yes. I have more highlights.

04:45.045 --> 04:48.981
And you changed your eyelids.
You had oculoplasty.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.883
- Um...
- You look more alert.

04:50.985 --> 04:52.384
Yeah...

04:52.486 --> 04:54.419
Well, the latest poll numbers are in

04:54.521 --> 04:56.722
and you've fallen 20 points
behind the Widow Sherman.

04:56.824 --> 04:59.024
We have to keep you away from people.

04:59.126 --> 05:02.728
Yeah, surround you with some trees.
Make you look human-sized.

05:02.830 --> 05:05.530
Yeah, back to the natural
habitat your nitwit mother

05:05.633 --> 05:08.567
found you in, you fucking
shaved Sasquatch.

05:08.669 --> 05:12.137
But the good news is that you're only three
points behind Jon H Ryan, whoever that is.

05:12.239 --> 05:15.674
Hey, Slick. What's Blondie's situation?

05:15.776 --> 05:18.510
Does she choke for Coke?

05:18.612 --> 05:20.312
You should ask her.

05:20.414 --> 05:21.446
Yeah.

05:21.548 --> 05:23.482
It's been a very hard year.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.550
The menopause has really
taken a hold of me.

05:25.653 --> 05:29.187
- Is that so? Yeah.
- Yes. You know... you're menopausal.

05:29.290 --> 05:31.456
- What?
- You're menopausal as well.

05:31.558 --> 05:32.858
- No, I'm not.
- Well...

05:32.960 --> 05:34.526
- No?
- What?

05:34.628 --> 05:35.961
No, you are.

05:36.063 --> 05:37.896
No, you're older than me, so I...

05:37.998 --> 05:40.098
No, I am actually two years younger.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.000
Oh, I still have regular periods,

05:42.102 --> 05:43.936
but my joints, they're very swollen.

05:44.038 --> 05:45.904
You know, I wonder if we can
just get back to the Chinese.

05:46.006 --> 05:49.841
The Chinese may try to change
the terms of the done deal.

05:49.944 --> 05:51.109
- Really?
- Yes.

05:51.211 --> 05:52.511
- But if they do this...
- Yeah?

05:52.613 --> 05:54.913
...you are simply ready
to perform the walkout

05:55.015 --> 05:56.915
to convince the Chinese
that you will not negotiate

05:57.017 --> 05:58.717
if the terms of the deal
are not satisfactory.

05:58.819 --> 06:00.786
- Okay.
- <i>You say the terms are unacceptable</i>

06:00.888 --> 06:03.288
and you take both your
palms and you place them

06:03.390 --> 06:05.090
firmly on the table like that.

06:05.192 --> 06:07.592
- Oh, God.
- Then you walk out.

06:07.695 --> 06:10.329
And then someone must say
this is unprecedented.

06:10.431 --> 06:12.230
- She never does this.
- Ben can do that.

06:12.333 --> 06:15.000
- Who, me?
- It is much harder than it sounds.

06:15.102 --> 06:16.969
- Perhaps we should rehearse?
- Absolutely.

06:17.071 --> 06:19.237
So this is unacceptable.

06:19.340 --> 06:21.673
And then, uh, I walk out.

06:21.775 --> 06:24.509
No, that is not credible. You try again.

06:24.611 --> 06:27.045
- This is unacceptable.
- Mm-hmm.

06:27.147 --> 06:29.581
No, you see, that's the
same, but it's just louder.

06:29.683 --> 06:30.646
She never does this.

06:30.671 --> 06:33.175
Oh, no, that is good.
Now, that is convincing.

06:33.253 --> 06:35.053
<i>- Hey, girlies.
- Mom.</i>

06:35.155 --> 06:37.155
- <i>Yes, honey?</i>
- I want you to open your gift.

06:37.257 --> 06:39.725
Since technically it's early
Christmas Eve, I got you something.

06:39.827 --> 06:41.693
What have we got here?

06:44.198 --> 06:45.082
Oh.

06:45.107 --> 06:47.757
It was used in 1907 at the
Second Hague Convention.

06:47.835 --> 06:50.769
And I figured you could use it
to sign important peace treaties

06:50.871 --> 06:52.337
when you're officially elected.

06:52.439 --> 06:54.439
It's actually lovely, Catherine.

06:54.541 --> 06:57.909
Amex gave me this crazy new card
that's made out of black metal.

06:58.012 --> 07:00.912
It truly shows the special

07:01.015 --> 07:03.749
mommy-daughter bond
that you and I share.

07:05.452 --> 07:07.219
- So good.
- I have an idea.

07:07.321 --> 07:10.255
Marjorie, why don't you open my gift?

07:10.357 --> 07:12.224
Oh, you got Marjorie a gift.

07:12.326 --> 07:15.127
Marjorie's part of the
family now, aren't you, pal?

07:15.229 --> 07:18.463
Yeah, I got Marjorie a gift, too.
Um, right, Gary?

07:18.565 --> 07:19.831
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

07:19.933 --> 07:21.400
- It's beautiful.
- Stuck in security.

07:21.502 --> 07:23.735
Stuck in security. I don't
know how that happened.

07:23.837 --> 07:26.138
- I got the tracking number.
- Okay. Let's see what you got.

07:29.209 --> 07:30.909
Ah, it's an old book.

07:31.011 --> 07:34.046
- Do you like it?
- I am overcome with emotion.

07:34.148 --> 07:35.814
Oh, my God.

07:35.916 --> 07:38.583
It's a first edition Gertrude Stein.

07:38.685 --> 07:39.851
<i>That's Marjorie's favorite poet.</i>

07:39.953 --> 07:41.720
How did you know that, Dad?

07:41.822 --> 07:42.364
I listen.

07:42.389 --> 07:44.013
I'm going to put
this someplace special.

07:44.091 --> 07:45.457
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:45.559 --> 07:48.060
I noticed two golf carts
filled with Asian people.

07:48.162 --> 07:52.898
- Yeah, we should go.
- That's the kitchen crew and the chef.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.966
- They wear really nice suits.
- Yeah.

07:55.069 --> 07:57.345
Okay, I want to go
find Marjorie's gift.

07:57.370 --> 07:58.127
Me, too.

07:58.205 --> 08:00.259
<i>So, I will
make the introductions.</i>

08:00.284 --> 08:01.030
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:01.108 --> 08:03.175
- You're wearing that?
- What?

08:03.277 --> 08:08.613
Yeah. Oh.

08:10.217 --> 08:13.685
This is President Lu Chi-Jang...

08:13.787 --> 08:15.386
Secretary General of
the Communist Party...

08:15.411 --> 08:16.645
Studied chemical engineering.

08:16.723 --> 08:18.690
He's currently on his second
wife, he enjoys tennis.

08:18.792 --> 08:20.659
...paramount leader of the
People's Republic of China.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.594
- This is Zhang Shengxi.
- He collects art.

08:22.696 --> 08:25.030
- Premier of the State Council.
- His son is a freshman at Georgetown.

08:25.132 --> 08:26.587
This is Xao Jintong,
1st Rank Vice Premier...

08:26.612 --> 08:27.623
London School of Economics.

08:27.701 --> 08:31.369
He enjoys fly fishing and his favorite
snack is freeze-dried strawberries.

08:31.472 --> 08:34.272
Thank you. I didn't get any
of that except strawberries.

08:34.374 --> 08:36.575
- Okay.
- ...the exchanging of gifts.

08:36.677 --> 08:38.977
This is a depiction of the most popular

08:39.078 --> 08:41.980
children's cartoon character
in China, Sad Piglet.

08:42.082 --> 08:44.249
It looks just like my
daughter Catherine.

08:44.351 --> 08:44.985
Huh?

08:45.010 --> 08:46.909
<i>Your daughter
is a beautiful woman</i>

08:46.987 --> 08:48.553
and this is a piglet.

08:48.655 --> 08:51.323
- <i>It's upset.</i>
- Oh, no, no, no. I... I love it.

08:51.425 --> 08:54.326
Believe me, if you say
SeaWorld to Catherine

08:54.428 --> 08:56.761
you will understand
what I'm talking about.

08:56.864 --> 08:59.197
This is just lovely.
Thank you very much.

08:59.299 --> 09:00.298
And now our gift.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.167
Oh.

09:02.269 --> 09:04.936
This is a silk robe
from the Qing Dynasty.

09:05.038 --> 09:06.972
The dragon symbolizes good fortune.

09:07.074 --> 09:09.307
Your generosity is overwhelming.

09:09.409 --> 09:11.109
- And so...
- This is...

09:11.211 --> 09:14.746
Seriously? This is
beyond what we imagined.

09:14.848 --> 09:16.581
Or prepared for.

09:16.683 --> 09:19.050
This is a tapestry from Qing Dynasty.

09:19.153 --> 09:21.153
The central image, the peony,

09:21.255 --> 09:24.189
is a symbol of royalty and virtue.

09:24.291 --> 09:28.560
This is exquisite and I
really hope that's all.

09:30.731 --> 09:33.398
And now our gifts for you.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.968
This is an American geode,

09:37.070 --> 09:41.740
which symbolizes the solid foundation

09:41.842 --> 09:44.576
that we have between our two countries.

09:44.678 --> 09:46.778
And it sparkles like we hope

09:46.880 --> 09:50.148
our conversation will sparkle.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.984
Thank you for this rock.

09:54.054 --> 09:55.353
Oh.

09:56.924 --> 10:00.492
Um, and this wine

10:00.594 --> 10:03.628
from Napa Valley, California.

10:05.699 --> 10:10.001
And this additional wine,
also from a local vineyard

10:10.103 --> 10:12.938
in, uh, New Zealand,

10:13.040 --> 10:15.473
which is local to us

10:15.576 --> 10:18.510
and it's also close to Asia,

10:18.612 --> 10:20.278
which makes it local to you

10:20.380 --> 10:22.948
as we are all local friends.

10:23.050 --> 10:25.283
- Thank you.
- She's just being polite.

10:25.385 --> 10:28.119
- President Lu does not drink.
- Oh, God.

10:28.222 --> 10:32.524
Um, Jang, there's a common
saying here in America,

10:32.626 --> 10:34.459
"But wait, there's more."

10:34.561 --> 10:37.395
So I would like to present
our final gift to you.

10:38.865 --> 10:42.167
A very meaningful and historic pen

10:42.269 --> 10:47.405
from the Second Hague
Conference of 1907.

10:47.507 --> 10:49.541
Gary, the box.

10:49.643 --> 10:51.910
- What? Really?
- Yes.

10:54.481 --> 10:57.616
- Oh!
- This is a very worthy gift.

10:57.718 --> 11:00.252
- Oh, good.
- It is historically significant and apt.

11:00.354 --> 11:02.654
Gold is a very auspicious
color for the Chinese.

11:02.756 --> 11:05.023
- It signifies prosperity and good luck.
- Oh, great.

11:05.125 --> 11:08.560
- You have pleased them.
- Oh, I'm pleased, then. Great.

11:08.662 --> 11:11.038
And now they are discussing
how casually you are dressed.

11:11.063 --> 11:11.854
Hmm?

11:11.932 --> 11:15.634
They say you look like a prisoner

11:15.736 --> 11:18.069
or a pirate.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.740
An exercise book.

11:21.842 --> 11:24.276
<i>Why did Menopause not warn us</i>

11:24.378 --> 11:26.344
that the Chinese were going
to out gift us like that?

11:26.446 --> 11:28.913
Our intel suggested they hated you.

11:29.016 --> 11:30.682
Ma'am, Dan and Amy for you.

11:30.784 --> 11:31.368
What?

11:31.393 --> 11:33.142
<i>Ma'am, Jonah shot
himself in the foot.</i>

11:33.220 --> 11:35.420
Oh, my God. What did he do this time?

11:35.522 --> 11:38.156
No, he literally shot himself
in the foot. We're in the ER.

11:38.258 --> 11:40.425
<i>Turn on CNN, ma'am.
It's on right now.</i>

11:40.527 --> 11:42.093
Turn on the...

11:42.195 --> 11:45.697
These are the woods where I used
to hunt with my stepfather.

11:45.799 --> 11:47.666
And he taught me the proper...

11:47.768 --> 11:49.968
Jesus!

11:50.070 --> 11:51.403
- Oh, my God.
<i>- I'm okay.</i>

11:51.505 --> 11:55.307
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

11:55.409 --> 11:58.843
- It's not funny, Ben.
- I know, it's terrible.

11:58.945 --> 12:01.346
- A little bit of blood.
- You are, it's all over the place.

12:01.448 --> 12:05.350
Jonah shot himself in the eye with
a rubber band in second grade.

12:05.452 --> 12:07.786
<i>I tell him now what I told him then...</i>

12:07.888 --> 12:09.387
guns can be dangerous.

12:09.489 --> 12:11.156
We're all praying for his recovery.

12:11.258 --> 12:13.124
So lay it on me. How bad is it?

12:13.226 --> 12:15.527
It's a complicated fracture.
Shattered some bone.

12:15.629 --> 12:18.330
- They say it's gonna take...
- No, not for him, for me.

12:18.432 --> 12:21.099
<i>Right. Critical condition, but
we're not throwing in the...</i>

12:21.201 --> 12:22.701
Okay, I'm not listening
to any more of this.

12:22.803 --> 12:24.502
That's New Hampshire for O'Brien.

12:24.604 --> 12:26.905
- We got to have those factories now.
- Ni hao.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.374
President Lu requests to go
on a nature walk with you.

12:29.476 --> 12:31.142
Well, I'm the president. I don't walk.

12:31.244 --> 12:33.778
He is also the president
and he likes to walk.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.280
On a walk?

12:35.382 --> 12:38.149
Camp David is where
President Eisenhower came

12:38.251 --> 12:40.452
to recover after his heart attack.

12:40.554 --> 12:43.588
Yeah.

12:43.690 --> 12:45.457
Is he okay?

12:45.559 --> 12:49.227
President Eis... he's pass... he's dead.
He's long gone.

12:49.329 --> 12:52.664
<i>Now this path was originally used
by F.D.R. for his morning strolls.</i>

12:52.766 --> 12:54.232
<i>Or rolls, I should say.</i>

12:54.334 --> 12:55.867
Uh, do you have more gum?

12:55.969 --> 12:57.569
Can I bum a piece of gum?

12:57.671 --> 13:00.071
Uh, may I chew gum with you?

13:01.408 --> 13:04.743
Thank you. Chinese gum, huh?

13:04.845 --> 13:06.845
Pretty cool. Never had it.

13:09.149 --> 13:11.816
Oh, wow. It's got a kick.

13:11.918 --> 13:13.418
Who knew?

13:13.520 --> 13:15.720
Thank... oh, hang on.

13:15.822 --> 13:17.589
I have just the thing.

13:17.691 --> 13:20.525
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- Sorry, no, no. Wrong language.

13:20.627 --> 13:22.327
Well, we need to work together

13:22.429 --> 13:24.763
to better engage with North Korea

13:24.865 --> 13:27.932
because the North Koreans
are people like us.

13:28.034 --> 13:30.235
Except without any food.

13:30.337 --> 13:32.737
Hi, Mom. Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

13:32.839 --> 13:34.973
- No, no.
- Just to be clear, my girlfriend and I

13:35.075 --> 13:37.142
aren't just vegan, we're raw vegan

13:37.244 --> 13:42.180
which means no meat, no dairy, and
absolutely nothing cooked at all.

13:44.151 --> 13:46.351
- Thank you.
- Okay, good.

13:46.453 --> 13:50.121
Mom, come back soon, okay? Monica's
making some nutmeg soy butter.

13:50.223 --> 13:52.791
Oh, how wonderful. Thank you.

13:52.893 --> 13:55.593
Ah, Jang, that was my daughter

13:55.695 --> 13:58.396
and she obviously did not recognize you.

13:58.498 --> 14:03.168
She doesn't understand anything
about global politics.

14:03.270 --> 14:07.439
My family is here as a cover story.

14:10.844 --> 14:12.977
No, but I didn't...
I didn't do that.

14:13.079 --> 14:15.580
I'm not...
I didn't make that face.

14:15.682 --> 14:18.716
Shall we carry on this way?

14:18.819 --> 14:21.419
Can you translate "we need to get
a new translator"?

14:21.521 --> 14:23.855
<i>- Marvin Gardens.
- You want it?</i>

14:23.957 --> 14:26.257
Catherine, can I borrow
200 Monopoly dollars?

14:26.359 --> 14:28.359
Oh, everybody's still awake.

14:28.462 --> 14:29.794
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hi.

14:29.896 --> 14:32.764
Is that Marjorie's gift from security?

14:34.868 --> 14:36.768
Yes.

14:36.870 --> 14:39.771
Ma'am, I mean, you
really didn't need to.

14:39.873 --> 14:41.272
Oh.

14:41.374 --> 14:44.909
Ma'am, this is stunning.

14:45.011 --> 14:48.046
Well, it's...
it's vintage.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.114
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh.

14:50.217 --> 14:53.651
Feels like it was woven out of
Catherine's silken hair. Feel this.

14:53.753 --> 14:56.421
- Aw.
- I thought you might enjoy something...

14:56.523 --> 14:59.023
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- ...that was like her hair.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.426
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Oh, you're welcome. Ow.

15:01.528 --> 15:03.761
<i>Mom, I can't believe that.
It's gorgeous.</i>

15:03.864 --> 15:05.630
- I got to go to bed.
<i>- It was my turn.</i>

15:05.732 --> 15:07.532
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:07.634 --> 15:10.268
You know that's government
property, right?

15:10.370 --> 15:13.204
- You just committed a federal crime.
<i>- It's real.</i>

15:17.644 --> 15:20.378
- You got to see this.
- Jesus, those are your pajamas?

15:20.480 --> 15:23.047
It's the outfit I picture
when I'm trying not to come.

15:23.149 --> 15:24.983
- Who's that?
- Oh...

15:25.085 --> 15:27.385
<i>Judy Sherman claims
she's for New Hampshire,</i>

15:27.487 --> 15:29.153
- <i>but what's her real agenda?</i>
- What is this?

15:29.256 --> 15:31.756
You need to be more careful.
Guns can be dangerous.

15:31.858 --> 15:33.191
<i>On election day,</i>

15:33.293 --> 15:36.194
<i>tell Judy Sherman you
care about freedom.</i>

15:36.296 --> 15:38.463
- What the fuck is going on?
- Look, it's everywhere.

15:38.565 --> 15:40.999
<i>...Sherman claims
she's for New Hampshire...</i>

15:41.101 --> 15:43.001
Oh, my God. Hey.

15:45.672 --> 15:48.239
It's the NRA.

15:48.341 --> 15:50.942
It's a Christmas miracle.

15:53.280 --> 15:56.080
All right, well, I'm gonna get back
to this, so I'll see you later.

15:57.684 --> 16:00.318
Okay, Kent, best guess, is
New Hampshire back in play?

16:00.420 --> 16:03.021
Ma'am, I don't even use the
colloquial phrase "I guess."

16:03.123 --> 16:06.257
- Get Dan and Amy right now.
- The Chinese are ready.

16:06.359 --> 16:08.259
- She never knocks.
- Uh, Minna,

16:08.361 --> 16:10.662
I am right in the middle of something.

16:10.764 --> 16:13.865
Selina, do I need to remind you how
sensitive the Chinese are to promptness?

16:13.967 --> 16:16.801
Then why is my wonton soup so
cold every time they deliver it?

16:16.903 --> 16:18.202
What?

16:18.305 --> 16:21.439
Minna, I'm the middle of an
international emergency.

16:21.541 --> 16:24.309
- Um, it's in the Middle East.
- Shh.

16:24.411 --> 16:26.444
It is in Kuwait and
that's all I can say.

16:26.546 --> 16:27.679
- Kuwait?
- <i>Yes.</i>

16:27.781 --> 16:29.581
That is so strange.

16:29.683 --> 16:32.650
Because Amir Al-Khabat and myself,
we follow each other on Instagram.

16:32.752 --> 16:35.753
Only five minutes ago, he posted
a picture of his dinner salad.

16:35.855 --> 16:38.256
Ah, well, it happened

16:38.358 --> 16:41.259
right after he had that salad, in fact.

16:41.361 --> 16:44.095
Sort of an intermezzo emergency.

16:44.197 --> 16:46.097
- Oop, I got Dan.
- Al-Egan.

16:46.199 --> 16:48.900
Yeah, the ambassador
to Kuwait's liaison.

16:49.002 --> 16:52.103
Thank you. As-salaam-alaikum, Dan.

16:52.205 --> 16:54.439
- Okay, I will take them for a walk.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

16:54.541 --> 16:55.607
Yeah. Okay.

16:55.709 --> 16:57.575
- Uh-huh.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

16:57.677 --> 17:00.011
Okay, so now we love the NRA.

17:00.557 --> 17:06.117
_

17:08.462 --> 17:12.195
_

17:14.694 --> 17:15.660
Huh?

17:19.965 --> 17:21.766
<i>The Chinese are very upset.</i>

17:21.867 --> 17:23.300
They have changed the terms of the deal.

17:23.403 --> 17:25.670
- What?
- The Chinese request the United States

17:25.771 --> 17:29.173
drop its objections to China's
claim of the Diaoyu Islands.

17:29.275 --> 17:31.209
How do I put this delicately?

17:31.311 --> 17:35.546
The Chinese were very disturbed
by a recent incident.

17:35.649 --> 17:36.881
What? What incident?

17:36.983 --> 17:39.283
With your daughter.

17:39.386 --> 17:42.053
Oh, my God. Minna, seriously,

17:42.155 --> 17:44.255
that was a complete honest mistake.

17:44.357 --> 17:45.690
Catherine was just confused.

17:45.792 --> 17:48.826
But you are her mother.
You did not stop her.

17:48.928 --> 17:52.096
How could I have stopped her?
I had to let her finish.

17:52.198 --> 17:54.198
You're a mother. You've got a son.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.034
I'm sure you've done it before.

17:56.136 --> 17:57.635
- You've been in this position.
- No, I have not.

17:57.737 --> 17:59.904
This happens occasionally in Iceland,

18:00.006 --> 18:01.773
but there it's just an accident.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.541
- What?
- What?

18:03.643 --> 18:06.511
God, this was their real
demand from the beginning.

18:06.613 --> 18:08.880
I mean, those islands
didn't come out of nowhere.

18:08.982 --> 18:10.915
Actually, they did. The
Chinese created islands

18:11.017 --> 18:12.784
by piling sediment from under the sea...

18:12.886 --> 18:15.153
Madam President, you can't
give them these islands.

18:15.255 --> 18:16.854
It'll destabilize the whole region.

18:16.956 --> 18:19.057
Will you please go and
talk to Chi-Jang and try...

18:19.159 --> 18:22.093
I will try, but I don't know how much
I'm going to be able to get his ear.

18:22.195 --> 18:25.163
But what you're gonna need to
do is let him get a word in.

18:25.265 --> 18:29.200
Okay, well, you know what? This reminds me
of negotiations between India and Bhutan.

18:29.302 --> 18:31.602
- Okay, this is what I'm talking about.
- Bhutan was being stubborn.

18:31.705 --> 18:33.371
So, I've got to go check
on my other prom date.

18:33.473 --> 18:34.872
Okay? I just...

18:34.974 --> 18:37.041
- Yes?
- I'm sorry, do you know where I can get

18:37.143 --> 18:39.277
any more of this amazing Chinese gum?

18:39.379 --> 18:40.778
It's nicotine gum.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.480
Oh, no.

18:51.458 --> 18:53.524
<i>Well, that does
not change the fact</i>

18:53.626 --> 18:58.029
that our friends in Japan still
have claims to the Diaoyu Islands.

18:58.131 --> 19:00.631
President Lu says
dropping your objections

19:00.734 --> 19:04.135
<i>must be part of any deal.</i>

19:04.237 --> 19:06.070
Well, that is unacceptable.

19:06.172 --> 19:09.006
- Unacceptable!
- She never does this.

19:09.109 --> 19:12.343
I mean, I will storm out. Here I go.

19:14.614 --> 19:18.015
No way. It's unacceptable!

19:18.118 --> 19:20.418
This is not happening.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.221
In all honesty, she's never done this.

19:25.699 --> 19:29.470
_

19:29.495 --> 19:32.072
_

19:32.932 --> 19:34.766
I know two million sounds
like a lot, sweetie.

19:34.868 --> 19:37.568
It's not. It's a small price to pay

19:37.670 --> 19:39.971
to save the Brazilian rain forest.

19:40.073 --> 19:43.141
But aren't you cutting down the rain
forest in order to build the resort?

19:43.243 --> 19:46.511
So we can conserve the rest.

19:46.613 --> 19:48.613
It's a virtuous cycle.

19:48.715 --> 19:50.848
- Well, I guess that makes sense.
<i>- Hey! Hey!</i>

19:50.950 --> 19:51.767
Hi, Mom.

19:51.792 --> 19:54.242
What are you guys doing
all the way out here?

19:54.320 --> 19:55.586
We can talk about this later.

19:55.688 --> 19:57.522
I'll leave the pamphlets on your pillow.

19:57.624 --> 20:00.925
- Thanks, Dad.
- Darling. Lee.

20:01.027 --> 20:03.027
Okay, listen to me.

20:03.129 --> 20:05.663
If you want to get advice
or talk about money,

20:05.765 --> 20:07.098
you can come to me, okay?

20:07.200 --> 20:09.233
I've got the whole Treasury Department.

20:09.335 --> 20:11.536
And they're, you know...

20:11.638 --> 20:13.571
they've been better, I realize.

20:13.673 --> 20:17.008
I mean, Daddy loves you, sweetheart,

20:17.110 --> 20:20.144
but he's a crook.

20:20.246 --> 20:21.546
- I know.
- Right?

20:21.648 --> 20:23.514
- Oh, excuse me.
- I just thought I could...

20:23.616 --> 20:26.150
I don't mean to interrupt
an intimate moment,

20:26.252 --> 20:30.154
it's just that there have been seismic
developments in the negotiations.

20:30.256 --> 20:31.956
You have really rattled
the Chinese leaders.

20:32.058 --> 20:33.257
- Oh.
- Chinese leaders?

20:33.359 --> 20:35.259
- Yes, Catherine.
- Seriously, Mom?

20:35.361 --> 20:38.162
I think he is going to use the gold pen
from the Second Hague Convention very soon.

20:38.264 --> 20:40.898
Your mother has given an amazing
pen to the Chinese leaders.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.501
- It's gold...
- She knows... she knows about that pen.

20:43.603 --> 20:46.504
You are so terrible.

20:46.606 --> 20:48.840
- Catherine.
- No.

20:48.942 --> 20:50.675
- Catherine. Okay.
- Sorry.

20:50.777 --> 20:53.044
Even labor and delivery
with her was a nightmare.

20:53.146 --> 20:54.245
Oh, yes? Why is that?

20:54.347 --> 20:55.580
You have a very narrow vagina?

20:55.682 --> 20:57.281
Well, tight. In the States we say tight.

20:57.383 --> 21:00.985
The Chinese economy is in a worse
state than anyone realized.

21:01.087 --> 21:02.820
These sanctions, they are
really crippling them.

21:02.922 --> 21:05.122
And Chi-Jang, he is a
proud, stubborn man.

21:05.225 --> 21:07.058
Like a Chinese Mr. Darcy.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.393
But stupid also, like a Chinese Mr.
Bingley.

21:09.495 --> 21:10.795
I love "Mary Poppins."

21:10.897 --> 21:13.831
So if the United States
lifts the sanctions

21:13.933 --> 21:16.534
and is prepared to meet their
demands for industrial metals

21:16.636 --> 21:20.838
for the next 25 years,
the Chinese might...

21:20.940 --> 21:25.343
might be prepared to discuss Tibet.

21:25.445 --> 21:28.546
- To bet on what?
- Wait, to talk about freeing Tibet?

21:28.648 --> 21:31.082
<i>No, they are prepared to
discuss a framework for talks</i>

21:31.184 --> 21:32.917
aimed at a possible path
to self-determination.

21:33.019 --> 21:35.686
- I'm freeing Tibet?
- No, no, not free.

21:35.788 --> 21:38.890
It would likely be one country,
two systems similar to Hong Kong.

21:38.992 --> 21:41.492
- That's it.
- Bono's gonna shit his sunglasses.

21:41.594 --> 21:44.762
That is like some man on
the moon legacy shit.

21:44.864 --> 21:49.400
My God, Selina Meyer, the
woman who freed Tibet.

21:49.502 --> 21:51.202
Not... no, really, not free.

21:51.304 --> 21:53.037
What about the factories in Ohio?

21:53.139 --> 21:54.906
Jonah's ahead in all the latest polls.

21:55.008 --> 21:57.575
Fuck those factories, man.
I'm freeing Tibet.

21:57.677 --> 21:59.543
- Fuck it!
- Really, not freeing.

21:59.646 --> 22:01.312
It is, of course, tragic

22:01.414 --> 22:04.115
for the unemployed workers
of Ohio and North Carolina.

22:04.217 --> 22:05.650
Well, they should have
tried going to college.

22:05.752 --> 22:07.752
Worry about your own
unemployment in Finland.

22:07.854 --> 22:09.487
We don't have unemployment in Finland.

22:09.589 --> 22:12.590
I'm gonna win a Nobel fucking
Peace Prize, you guys.

22:12.692 --> 22:14.959
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

22:15.061 --> 22:16.894
- Oh, sorry. Are you all right?
- It's okay.

22:16.996 --> 22:19.497
And Tibet will have a new future.

22:19.599 --> 22:22.076
Oh, God, sorry, sorry.
Excuse me. Hey, babe.

22:22.101 --> 22:23.091
Hare Krishna.

22:23.169 --> 22:25.036
Hi. How was the ultrasound?

22:27.807 --> 22:29.974
Twins? Oh, my God.

22:30.076 --> 22:32.810
Oh, no, I'm twice as happy now.

22:34.109 --> 22:36.805
<i>Hmm, who should I vote for, huh?</i>

22:36.883 --> 22:38.382
Pow, pow.

22:38.484 --> 22:42.520
Who should I vote for?
You can't teach that.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.422
I hope he votes for himself.

22:44.524 --> 22:47.658
Oh, I'm sorry. I need another ballot.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.261
I just... I just need another ballot.

22:50.363 --> 22:52.797
Pow, pow.

22:52.899 --> 22:54.632
<i>I don't want to talk to you.</i>

22:54.734 --> 22:56.600
I want to tell you something,

22:56.703 --> 22:59.537
but it's very confidential, okay?

22:59.639 --> 23:02.506
Mommy is going to free Tibet.

23:02.608 --> 23:04.141
<i>I don't care.</i>

23:04.243 --> 23:06.510
Catherine, come on, honey,
remember when you were little

23:06.612 --> 23:09.880
and you had that "Free Tibet" sticker
and you put it up on the wall

23:09.983 --> 23:13.818
and we couldn't get it off, remember, because
you put it on wallpaper inexplicably.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.587
Hey, Kit-Cat. It's me. Can I come in?

23:16.689 --> 23:18.122
<i>Just you.</i>

23:20.927 --> 23:24.428
- Hey, baby.
- Well, yeah.

23:31.938 --> 23:33.471
Wonderful.

23:33.573 --> 23:36.207
<i>- Gan bei!
- Gan bei!</i>

23:37.577 --> 23:39.477
And now, let us celebrate

23:39.579 --> 23:42.380
with a traditional Christmas feast.

23:42.482 --> 23:44.815
This is a...

23:46.953 --> 23:50.021
culturally significant
and traditional...

23:50.123 --> 23:52.223
- Freedom log.
- ...freedom log.

23:52.325 --> 23:56.494
Why don't we slice that
up for everyone to enjoy?

23:56.596 --> 24:01.332
You know, we have a statement
that is ready for release.

24:03.369 --> 24:05.202
There will be no statement.

24:05.304 --> 24:07.371
These are very delicate issues

24:07.473 --> 24:08.672
and cannot be rushed.

24:08.775 --> 24:09.974
Oh, yes, of course.

24:10.076 --> 24:12.143
I understand that completely.

24:12.245 --> 24:16.881
Although, perhaps when things
are as significant as Tibet,

24:16.983 --> 24:22.086
things are accidently
leaked to the press

24:22.188 --> 24:25.589
so that the world may know
of our accomplishments.

24:29.662 --> 24:32.163
It would be very unfortunate
if it also leaked

24:32.265 --> 24:36.300
that you lied to your country
about our hacking of your tweets.

24:36.402 --> 24:38.069
That is ridiculous.

24:38.171 --> 24:40.671
We have your emails to prove it.

24:42.708 --> 24:46.644
Okay, well, we can just wait for
you guys to release a statement.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.913
<i>- Xiè xie.
- Xiè xie.</i>

24:50.983 --> 24:52.049
Minna.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.720
Mr. McLintock?

24:56.823 --> 24:58.856
- Mm-hmm.
- Good news.

24:58.958 --> 25:00.791
Your adoption paper has been approved.

25:00.893 --> 25:04.161
You and your wife soon
will have a Chinese baby.

25:04.263 --> 25:05.963
Congratulations.

25:08.367 --> 25:09.900
What is happening?

25:10.002 --> 25:11.402
<i>Well, good-bye, Andrew.</i>

25:11.504 --> 25:14.438
Catherine has any questions
about the Brazil investment,

25:14.540 --> 25:16.440
- always available.
- I have a question.

25:16.542 --> 25:19.743
Is it actually an investment in Brazil?

25:19.846 --> 25:20.978
I can take this if you'd like.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.813
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

25:22.915 --> 25:24.815
- Thank you for everything, ma'am.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

25:24.917 --> 25:27.952
All right, wheels up in
10 minutes on Marine One.

25:28.054 --> 25:29.353
Pick up the...

25:29.455 --> 25:31.655
- Oh, hi, Catherine.
- Really?

25:31.757 --> 25:33.324
- What?
- It's official.

25:33.426 --> 25:35.759
At 8:20 this evening, the
Widow Sherman conceded.

25:35.862 --> 25:38.429
Oh, H.R. Fucknstuf,
Jonah won the election?

25:38.531 --> 25:39.425
It was a small margin.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.523
But still counts as a
sign of the apocalypse.

25:41.601 --> 25:45.035
- So Jonah's gonna vote for me and I'm...
- Gonna be president!

25:45.138 --> 25:47.004
- I've got to call him.
- I got him. He's right here.

25:47.106 --> 25:48.706
Oh, my God.

25:48.808 --> 25:50.374
Congressman Ryan.

25:50.476 --> 25:52.243
<i>Hello, Madam President.</i>

25:52.345 --> 25:54.745
- Or should I call you colleague now?
- I wouldn't.

25:54.847 --> 25:56.514
And I just want to let you know that I,

25:56.616 --> 25:58.549
Congressman Jonah Ryan,

25:58.651 --> 26:02.153
will personally deliver you the vote
that delivers you the presidency.

26:02.255 --> 26:05.623
- That means so much to me.
- <i>Ma'am, while I have you on the phone,</i>

26:05.725 --> 26:08.759
New Hampshire is struggling with
an epidemic of opiate addict...

26:08.861 --> 26:10.161
Yeah, I'm not gonna...

26:10.263 --> 26:11.695
Oh! Oh, God.

26:11.797 --> 26:14.498
- Oh, good. That goes in my bag.
- Yeah.

26:18.871 --> 26:21.572
I can elect anyone in New Hampshire.

26:21.674 --> 26:24.542
- I can elect a Muslim AIDS virus.
- Okay, Jeff.

26:24.644 --> 26:27.311
A terrorist fucking AIDS virus

26:27.413 --> 26:30.347
in the tiniest suicide vest ever made,

26:30.449 --> 26:32.149
I could make it governor
of New Hampshire.

26:32.251 --> 26:33.551
Okay, Jeff, you're drunk.

26:33.653 --> 26:35.819
New Hampshire, wow. Wow, New Hampshire.

26:35.922 --> 26:37.121
Thank you.

26:37.223 --> 26:40.558
Oh, my God. I did this.

26:40.660 --> 26:43.694
We just elected Jonah to Congress.

26:43.796 --> 26:47.097
Looking around, I see so many
familiar faces of people

26:47.200 --> 26:50.334
- that supported me and believed in me.
- Yeah.

26:50.436 --> 26:52.503
And I see a few that didn't.

26:52.605 --> 26:54.171
Like Jessica Thompson.

26:54.273 --> 26:57.074
Hey, Jessica. Jessica, I see you there.

26:57.176 --> 26:59.043
Yeah, it's been a long
time since high school.

26:59.145 --> 27:00.711
I like what you did with your hair.

27:00.813 --> 27:03.113
- Do you like what I did with my life?
- Oh!

27:03.216 --> 27:06.283
Jimmy O'Connor, I've been waiting
20 years to say this to you.

27:06.385 --> 27:09.053
Oh, my God, I did this.

27:09.155 --> 27:11.355
You just elected Jonah to Congress.

27:11.457 --> 27:13.857
<i>I think that you are the spaz.</i>

27:13.960 --> 27:15.626
But through it all,

27:15.728 --> 27:19.763
there was one person who
truly believed in Jonah Ryan

27:19.865 --> 27:22.166
and that was Jonah Ryan.

27:22.268 --> 27:23.734
This is my dream,

27:23.836 --> 27:26.470
that you can believe in yourself so hard

27:26.572 --> 27:28.906
that you eventually
become a congressman.

27:29.008 --> 27:31.508
Thank you, New Hampshire. Thank you.

27:31.611 --> 27:34.111
<i>Yeah, well, we're thrilled.
Thank you, Congressman.</i>

27:34.213 --> 27:36.780
Jonah is gonna be sworn in
with the rest of the freshmen.

27:36.882 --> 27:37.891
Yeah.

27:37.916 --> 27:40.942
Mom, I've come to a
decision, by the way,

27:41.020 --> 27:42.853
about the Palm Beach house.

27:42.955 --> 27:45.723
- Okay, Catherine, listen...
- I'm keeping it.

27:45.825 --> 27:47.891
Oh, Catherine.

27:47.994 --> 27:51.161
And I'm turning it into a sanctuary
for rescued farm animals.

27:51.264 --> 27:52.763
What?

27:52.865 --> 27:55.432
- Rescued farm animals.
- Yeah, I heard her.

27:55.534 --> 27:56.967
I think it's inspiring, ma'am.

27:57.069 --> 27:58.736
You're taking my daddy's house

27:58.838 --> 28:03.641
and turning it into some
Club Med for goats?

28:03.743 --> 28:04.975
Well, it won't be just goats.

28:05.077 --> 28:06.810
I mean, there's so much property

28:06.912 --> 28:08.746
that we were talking about all
different kinds of animals.

28:08.848 --> 28:10.481
I mean, you could have ducks or...

28:10.583 --> 28:12.416
<i>- Lame horses.</i>
- Pigs.

28:12.518 --> 28:14.618
<i>- Pigs. Potbellied pigs.</i>
- Emus.

28:14.720 --> 28:17.087
- Oh.
- And we could have horses as well.

28:17.189 --> 28:19.056
- Okay.
<i>- We could have peacocks, too.</i>

28:19.158 --> 28:21.592
- Can you do llamas?
- Oh, yeah, we could have llamas.

28:21.694 --> 28:24.161
<i>- Llamas.</i>
- Maybe a three-legged goat.
