00:18.559 --> 00:21.233
<i>There was a time above.</i>

00:21.399 --> 00:23.754
<i>A time before.</i>

00:23.960 --> 00:26.713
<i>There were perfect things,</i>

00:26.920 --> 00:29.149
<i>diamond absolutes.</i>

00:30.160 --> 00:32.435
<i>How things fall.</i>

00:32.600 --> 00:35.033
<i>Things on Earth.</i>

00:35.200 --> 00:36.792
<i>And what falls...</i>

00:37.399 --> 00:38.600
Master Wayne!

00:38.799 --> 00:40.152
<i>- ... is fallen.</i>
- Bruce!

00:42.119 --> 00:43.472
<i>Bruce, it's all right.</i>

00:45.960 --> 00:47.279
<i>Bruce, please.</i>

03:10.719 --> 03:12.711
Martha.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.598
<i>In the dream,
they took me to the light.</i>

04:48.759 --> 04:50.591
<i>A beautiful lie.</i>

05:36.040 --> 05:37.108
<i>- Jack.</i>
- Bruce.

05:37.279 --> 05:38.713
Jack, listen to me.

05:38.879 --> 05:41.120
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.079
<i>- You understand?</i>
- Oh, my God.

05:43.279 --> 05:44.456
<i>Stay away from the windows!</i>

05:44.480 --> 05:46.600
Let's go. Come on.
Start moving now, people. Let's go.

05:46.759 --> 05:49.399
The boss wants us out of the building,
so let's make it happen.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.476
Jack. Jack!

07:32.480 --> 07:34.016
<i>We're sorry.</i>

07:34.040 --> 07:38.351
<i>All circuits are busy now.
Will you please try your call again later?</i>

07:39.840 --> 07:41.353
Heavenly God,

07:42.560 --> 07:44.117
creator of Heaven and Earth,

07:45.480 --> 07:46.629
have mercy on my soul.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.629
Jack!

08:30.120 --> 08:32.918
Buddy hands! Everybody show me! Good job!

08:33.960 --> 08:35.187
Come on, guys.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.318
<i>Hold on tight.</i>

08:39.919 --> 08:40.919
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

08:42.519 --> 08:43.519
Go.

08:43.759 --> 08:44.828
<i>Mr. Wayne!</i>

08:45.039 --> 08:47.951
Mr. Wayne! I can't feel my legs.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.696
I can't feel my legs.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.559
We need help over here!

08:52.120 --> 08:53.438
Help me. I can't feel my legs.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.192
You're gonna be okay. You hear me?

08:56.120 --> 08:58.315
Wallace?
What do they call you, Wally? Huh?

09:00.480 --> 09:01.595
You're the boss, boss.

09:03.279 --> 09:05.429
All right. You're gonna be okay.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.952
Easy, easy. Come on.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.719
<i>Oh, my God.
I can't move my leg.</i>

09:12.600 --> 09:14.669
My God. I can't feel my legs.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.990
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

09:25.159 --> 09:28.311
You're okay. All right? Huh?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.120
You know what? We're gonna find your mom.

09:30.559 --> 09:31.629
Where is she?

11:34.279 --> 11:37.590
All that wind is bad luck.
Blood in the sky.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.475
Oh, there she is!

11:48.080 --> 11:49.115
Miss Lane.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.638
<i>Miss Lane. Jimmy Olsen.</i>

11:52.799 --> 11:54.630
Photographer. Obviously.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.352
Where's Heron?

11:56.639 --> 11:57.913
Uh, trouble at the border.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.317
So, uh, how'd you land it?
This is, like, pioneer stuff.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.710
Amajagh's never given an interview.

12:05.879 --> 12:08.837
You know what Heron always
says when we're on assignment together?

12:10.200 --> 12:11.633
Not a goddamn thing.

12:12.559 --> 12:13.708
I like Heron.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.668
Let's go.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.389
<i>Passports.
Electronics. Phones. Camera.</i>

12:37.559 --> 12:39.869
Your fixer said that
the general approved photos.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.955
Are you a terrorist, General?

13:12.039 --> 13:15.191
They did not tell me the interview
was with a lady.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.793
I'm not a lady. I'm a journalist.

13:19.559 --> 13:22.312
<i>What I am
is a man with nothing</i>

13:23.200 --> 13:25.076
<i>except a love of my people.</i>

13:26.399 --> 13:28.788
Who's paying for these
security contractors, General?

13:29.399 --> 13:31.681
Who pays for the drones
that pass over our heads at night?

13:33.559 --> 13:35.216
<i>One question begs another.</i>

13:35.240 --> 13:36.389
<i>Yes?</i>

13:36.960 --> 13:38.597
<i>Say what you're saying, General.</i>

13:38.759 --> 13:40.158
It's just a camera.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.630
The United States
has declared its neutrality

13:42.840 --> 13:43.919
in your country's civil war

13:44.000 --> 13:46.149
both in policy and in principle.

13:46.919 --> 13:49.480
Don't open... You just exposed...

13:51.879 --> 13:54.075
These pious American fictions...

13:54.240 --> 13:55.831
<i>...spoken like truth.</i>

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Okay. That's my film.

14:01.919 --> 14:06.994
Men with power obey
neither policy nor principle, Miss Lane.

14:10.399 --> 14:11.434
<i>No one is different.</i>

14:12.440 --> 14:14.556
No one is neutral.

14:24.399 --> 14:25.399
CIA.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.874
They're tracking us!

14:28.519 --> 14:29.679
You!

14:34.639 --> 14:35.788
You're CIA?

14:35.960 --> 14:37.187
What? No. No!

14:37.360 --> 14:39.475
- You brought him here!
- No, he's a photographer.

14:41.279 --> 14:42.559
No!

14:47.799 --> 14:49.198
It's okay, Lois.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.080
Talon's down, sir.

15:08.759 --> 15:10.519
Python, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.789
Repeat, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.832
There's still a civilian in
the compound. We'll extract her.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.798
<i>Negative. RPA to engage.
Stand down and get black.</i>

15:19.360 --> 15:22.113
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...

15:22.320 --> 15:23.719
Call off the goddamn drone.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.999
Stand down is an order. Python?

15:27.559 --> 15:28.595
Let's move!

15:36.799 --> 15:37.914
I...

15:38.519 --> 15:39.519
I didn't know.

15:40.279 --> 15:44.875
Ignorance is not the same as innocence,

15:45.519 --> 15:46.713
Miss Lane.

16:13.919 --> 16:16.514
Get up! Stand up!

16:28.919 --> 16:30.591
Quickly. He's coming.

16:43.759 --> 16:45.078
Inbound 2 mikes.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.995
<i>Passing Python now.</i>

16:56.279 --> 16:57.428
Move out!

17:04.839 --> 17:06.910
- Target locked.
- You are clear to engage.

17:07.598 --> 17:08.874
Armed hot and in range.

17:14.279 --> 17:15.837
<i>Three.</i>

17:17.960 --> 17:19.996
Two. One.

17:30.559 --> 17:31.913
Link's been hit.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.552
By what?

17:38.000 --> 17:41.197
Take one step,
you will see the inside of her head.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.913
<i>The women
in the village heard a noise.</i>

19:09.119 --> 19:12.669
Like the sky cracked open.

19:14.119 --> 19:17.795
He came down. Then came fire.

19:19.799 --> 19:21.711
<i>Even worse came after.</i>

19:22.880 --> 19:24.358
<i>The government attacked.</i>

19:25.119 --> 19:27.155
<i>No mercy in the villages.</i>

19:28.519 --> 19:30.271
My parents tried to run.

19:34.960 --> 19:38.111
The world has been so caught up
with what Superman can do

19:38.319 --> 19:41.073
that no one has asked what he should do.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.991
Let the record show that this
committee holds him responsible.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.111
<i>He'll never answer to you.</i>

19:49.279 --> 19:53.750
He answers to no one.
Not even, I think, to God.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.148
<i>58 to nothing.</i>

19:58.319 --> 20:00.470
<i>Metropolis, again,
blowing out Gotham City.</i>

20:00.640 --> 20:02.695
<i>Really, only the diehards
are left in the stands.</i>

20:02.720 --> 20:05.455
<i>Delta Charlie 27.
Reports of screams coming from vacant home</i>

20:05.480 --> 20:07.198
<i>at 1939 Harborway.</i>

20:07.400 --> 20:08.855
<i>Tom, it's been great
working with you.</i>

20:08.880 --> 20:10.519
<i>I want to thank our
producer and director.</i>

20:10.680 --> 20:12.135
<i>- Now wait a second.
- I don't even want to suggest...</i>

20:12.160 --> 20:13.615
<i>Delta Charlie 27, respond.</i>

20:13.640 --> 20:14.640
Just take a knee.

20:14.799 --> 20:17.576
<i>They're lining up as if
Clarkson is gonna throw it deep here.</i>

20:17.599 --> 20:18.935
<i>- Don't tell me, Dave.
- Going to the end zone!</i>

20:18.960 --> 20:20.655
<i>- This is unnecessary.
- Delta Charlie 27.</i>

20:20.680 --> 20:23.672
<i>Zeke Baker is open.
Baker with a touchdown catch!</i>

20:23.839 --> 20:25.215
<i>I can't believe
I just watched that.</i>

20:25.240 --> 20:27.390
<i>Delta Charlie 27.
Do you copy?</i>

20:28.400 --> 20:29.627
10-4. We're on it.

20:29.799 --> 20:31.676
<i>And now
a fight breaks out.</i>

20:31.880 --> 20:35.190
<i>Gotham City, you know
how they are about their football team.</i>

20:35.400 --> 20:38.153
<i>Things could get ugly
in the city tonight.</i>

21:19.039 --> 21:20.314
Go.

21:33.119 --> 21:34.154
It's okay.

21:34.759 --> 21:35.875
It's okay.

21:36.039 --> 21:37.920
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.469
We're gonna get you out of here. Okay?

21:51.680 --> 21:53.113
I don't understand.

21:57.839 --> 21:59.557
<i>Please don't.
Please don't.</i>

22:08.119 --> 22:11.395
<i>Please. I don't know who he is.</i>

22:14.680 --> 22:15.999
<i>I don't know who he is!</i>

22:19.200 --> 22:20.997
<i>No!</i>

22:41.680 --> 22:42.907
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Christ!

23:23.160 --> 23:24.512
I saw him.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.557
<i>I never saw him before.
I... I didn't know.</i>

23:26.720 --> 23:28.153
You almost took my face off.

23:28.319 --> 23:30.355
How about you don't shoot
the good guys, huh?

23:31.920 --> 23:33.797
Oh. Oh.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.911
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

23:36.079 --> 23:37.718
<i>He branded him.</i>

25:07.920 --> 25:09.875
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:10.079 --> 25:11.432
I was gonna cook.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.153
Surprise you.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.596
They held hearings about what happened.

25:21.759 --> 25:23.256
<i>- They're saying that...</i>
- I don't care.

25:23.279 --> 25:25.270
I don't care what they're saying.

25:27.279 --> 25:29.240
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot.

25:29.839 --> 25:31.016
<i>Think of what could have happened.</i>

25:31.039 --> 25:33.348
Well, think about what did happen.

25:33.519 --> 25:35.795
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.096
If that's what you're saying.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.792
No, I'm saying
I want to understand what happened.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.711
I'm saying thank you for saving my life.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.632
<i>I'm saying there's a cost.</i>

25:54.519 --> 25:56.476
I just don't know if it's possible.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.199
Don't know if what's possible?

26:02.640 --> 26:04.153
For you to love me and be you.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.073
Clark!

26:35.039 --> 26:37.269
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.391
Mmm-hmm.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.400
You still working?

27:14.559 --> 27:16.949
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

27:17.119 --> 27:19.076
Comes to us all, Master Wayne.

27:20.359 --> 27:22.476
Even you got too old to die young.

27:24.559 --> 27:26.789
And not for lack of trying.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.336
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>

27:31.359 --> 27:32.776
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry...</i>

27:32.799 --> 27:34.440
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

27:35.640 --> 27:37.550
It's this new layer of armor.

27:38.759 --> 27:40.159
I'll just have to rewire.

27:42.039 --> 27:45.509
So, last night was productive?

27:46.960 --> 27:49.997
No. He's too low-level. He knew nothing.

27:50.359 --> 27:52.270
This is the man who knows things.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.471
Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian.

27:57.119 --> 27:58.439
Contracts all over the globe,

27:58.599 --> 28:00.096
<i>but he's based out of the port of Gotham.</i>

28:00.119 --> 28:01.633
<i>Weapons and human trafficking.</i>

28:01.799 --> 28:03.559
<i>So the White Portuguese
is a Russian.</i>

28:03.599 --> 28:04.919
That's the theory.

28:05.119 --> 28:10.114
No. The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.272
If he is, indeed, a "him."

28:14.519 --> 28:17.397
You don't even know if he exists.
Could be a phantasm.

28:17.559 --> 28:19.630
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

28:20.799 --> 28:22.471
Ah, high-stakes round.

28:25.559 --> 28:27.278
<i>New rules.</i>

28:30.440 --> 28:32.112
We're criminals, Alfred.

28:32.279 --> 28:34.395
We've always been criminals.
Nothing's changed.

28:35.519 --> 28:36.748
Oh, yes, it has, sir.

28:39.319 --> 28:40.833
Everything's changed.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.392
<i>Men fall from the sky.</i>

28:48.759 --> 28:50.829
The gods hurl thunderbolts.

28:52.279 --> 28:54.031
<i>Innocents die.</i>

28:55.440 --> 28:57.112
<i>That's how it starts, sir.</i>

28:58.000 --> 29:00.150
<i>The fever. The rage.</i>

29:00.319 --> 29:03.153
The feeling of powerlessness.

29:04.839 --> 29:08.752
It turns good men cruel.

29:20.440 --> 29:21.634
<i>John, get D.</i>

29:23.759 --> 29:25.796
Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, ahoy!
I did not know you were here.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.836
- Man on the marquee.
- Yeah, don't believe it.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.375
My father named the company
after himself.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.400
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.
How you doin'?

29:31.440 --> 29:32.634
Really great.

29:32.799 --> 29:35.519
Really great? Good. Good.
Uh, follow me.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.432
No, uh, Dad started saying
that he named the company,

29:38.640 --> 29:40.153
after his kid at investor pitches.

29:40.319 --> 29:42.559
Rich old ladies.
They thought it was very cute, you know?

29:42.599 --> 29:44.317
"Write checks for Lex."

29:45.599 --> 29:47.590
You know, Dad was born in East Germany.

29:47.799 --> 29:49.915
He grew up eating stale crackers.

29:50.079 --> 29:52.160
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

29:52.319 --> 29:54.197
and wave flowers at tyrants.

29:54.359 --> 29:58.068
So, I think it was providence
that his son, me,

29:58.240 --> 29:59.388
would end up with this.

29:59.599 --> 30:02.067
One of my Rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.673
<i>Little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.</i>

30:04.839 --> 30:06.839
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?

30:06.880 --> 30:08.551
Homeland security? Hmm.

30:08.720 --> 30:11.393
No, no, no, ma'am, planetary security.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.269
<i>The fragment
is of a radioactive xenomineral.</i>

30:14.440 --> 30:16.670
<i>We suspected it might
have bio-interactions,</i>

30:16.839 --> 30:18.750
so we took the sample to AMRIID,

30:20.240 --> 30:23.277
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

30:23.720 --> 30:26.916
And, when we exposed
General Zod to the mineral,

30:27.079 --> 30:28.307
this happened.

30:28.960 --> 30:33.271
<i>Profound biodegradation.
Decaying Kryptonian cells.</i>

30:33.440 --> 30:35.016
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

30:35.039 --> 30:36.440
if a large enough sample was found.

30:36.599 --> 30:39.830
And then, among the fishes, a whale.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.200
<i>Ah!</i>

30:41.519 --> 30:43.556
<i>Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.</i>

30:44.160 --> 30:45.479
Emerald City.

30:46.599 --> 30:48.352
<i>Beautiful.</i>

30:48.519 --> 30:49.748
<i>Now, Rocky is radioactive,</i>

30:49.920 --> 30:53.116
but what he needs from you
is an import license.

30:53.279 --> 30:55.634
And why would we want to
weaponize this material?

30:55.839 --> 30:56.839
<i>As a deterrent.</i>

30:57.039 --> 30:59.455
A silver bullet to keep in reserve,
to use against the Kryptonians,

30:59.480 --> 31:00.833
so the day does not come, madam,

31:01.039 --> 31:03.359
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.952
Last I looked, the only one of those

31:05.119 --> 31:06.758
flying around up here was Superman.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.957
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are...

31:10.119 --> 31:11.119
<i>There are more of them.</i>

31:11.279 --> 31:12.473
The metahuman thesis.

31:12.680 --> 31:13.953
<i>Yes, the metahuman thesis.</i>

31:14.119 --> 31:15.394
<i>More likely than not</i>

31:15.599 --> 31:17.431
these exceptional beings live among us.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.789
The basis of our myths.
Gods among men upon

31:19.960 --> 31:21.518
our little blue planet here.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.111
Now, you don't have to use
a silver bullet.

31:26.319 --> 31:28.390
But if you forge one...

31:28.599 --> 31:29.952
Well, then

31:30.200 --> 31:32.474
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.515
There are ways we can help each other.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.950
Would you step
into my office here?

31:46.920 --> 31:48.147
Yes.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.397
What's your wish list?

31:54.240 --> 31:56.992
Access to the wreck of
the crashed Kryptonian ship?

31:59.119 --> 32:00.189
Done.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.232
The complete remains
of the dead alien for testing.

32:53.839 --> 32:55.067
You want Zod's body?

32:56.319 --> 32:57.319
Okay.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.229
Mmm.

33:33.680 --> 33:34.907
It's cherry.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.239
Mmm-mmm.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.873
<i>Because the time has come</i>

33:43.079 --> 33:46.197
<i>for the world to hear
the other side of the story.</i>

33:46.359 --> 33:49.590
<i>They say that Superman is a hero.
Okay, but whose hero?</i>

33:49.759 --> 33:51.910
<i>If Superman
were here right now,</i>

33:52.079 --> 33:53.479
<i>what would you want to say to him?</i>

33:54.119 --> 33:56.111
<i>That my family,
too, had dreams.</i>

33:58.279 --> 34:02.636
<i>To look him in his eye
and ask him how he decides</i>

34:03.319 --> 34:04.752
<i>which lives count.</i>

34:05.519 --> 34:07.192
<i>And which ones do not.</i>

35:17.519 --> 35:18.873
Sir, get down.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.914
Sir, I said get down!

35:23.079 --> 35:24.273
<i>Now!</i>

35:26.039 --> 35:27.552
<i>Can we get some backup here?</i>

35:28.840 --> 35:30.831
<i>Hey! Hey! Don't do it!</i>

35:31.000 --> 35:32.114
<i>Hey!</i>

35:34.519 --> 35:36.750
Lois! Crime lab, on three.

35:38.719 --> 35:40.233
- This is Lane.
<i>- Kent.</i>

35:40.400 --> 35:41.514
You're Sports today.

35:41.679 --> 35:44.034
I want you to go to Gotham,
follow up on football.

35:44.239 --> 35:47.949
"Underdog Dreams Dashed:
Ten Yards Between Gotham and Glory."

35:48.840 --> 35:51.195
Watch yourself over there in Gotham.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.840
Don't let them take your lunch money.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.717
Hey. Are you guys watching this?

35:55.920 --> 35:57.360
<i>Emergency responders quickly created</i>

35:57.440 --> 36:00.034
<i>a precautionary perimeter
around Heroes Park</i>

36:00.199 --> 36:02.519
<i>while they brought the man down
from this beloved monument.</i>

36:02.719 --> 36:05.836
<i>The suspect has been identified
as Wallace Vernon Keefe.</i>

36:06.000 --> 36:08.719
<i>I work for Bruce Wayne!</i>

36:08.880 --> 36:11.552
<i>He'll be arraigned
on charges of vandalism,</i>

36:11.719 --> 36:12.755
<i>resisting arrest,</i>

36:12.920 --> 36:15.150
<i>and the felony charge of
making terrorist threats.</i>

36:15.360 --> 36:16.952
<i>That carries up to 40 years in prison.</i>

36:17.119 --> 36:18.313
Poor son of a bitch.

36:18.559 --> 36:19.992
<i>Metropolis News 8.</i>

36:20.280 --> 36:21.280
- Jenny.
- Hmm.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.829
Headline, "End of Love Affair
with Man in the Sky,

36:25.000 --> 36:26.228
<i>"question mark. "</i>

36:27.920 --> 36:29.114
Okay.

37:10.679 --> 37:11.679
Is she in?

37:12.559 --> 37:13.958
No, she's been gone.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.628
<i>What'd she do,
officer?</i>

37:17.000 --> 37:20.150
I'm not a cop. I'm a reporter.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.637
The young lady living here...

37:24.119 --> 37:25.472
She hasn't been back.

37:25.679 --> 37:27.920
In fact, if she's smart,
then she's got out of this city.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.833
And you need to
get out of here before dark.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.135
Unless you want to run into him.

37:32.159 --> 37:34.150
<i>Don't listen to that nonsense.</i>

37:34.320 --> 37:37.835
Only people scared of him,
people who got reason to be.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.148
Scared of who?

37:39.360 --> 37:42.032
There's a new kind of mean in him.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.954
He is angry.

37:46.119 --> 37:47.599
And he's hunting.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.440
<i>Show 'em what you got!</i>

37:52.920 --> 37:54.637
Let's go. Come on!

37:58.039 --> 37:59.233
Throw a punch, will ya?

38:00.920 --> 38:03.150
Let's go! Come on!

38:26.320 --> 38:27.434
Thank you.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.880
The house treats luck like an insult.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.552
Good luck for one is always
his brother's misfortune.

38:46.199 --> 38:47.615
Three nights with a Bolshoi ballerina,

38:47.639 --> 38:48.958
that line was all she taught me.

38:49.480 --> 38:52.472
Not all, I'm sure. Good evening.

38:58.079 --> 38:59.911
<i>It's like a one-man
reign of terror.</i>

39:00.079 --> 39:03.628
This Bat vigilante has been
consistently targeting the port

39:03.800 --> 39:05.597
and the adjacent projects and tenements.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.815
And, as far as I can tell,
the cops are actually helping him.

39:07.840 --> 39:10.592
"Crime Wave in Gotham."

39:10.760 --> 39:13.956
Other breaking news, "Water, Wet."

39:14.159 --> 39:15.434
Did you file the football yet?

39:15.599 --> 39:17.476
Why aren't we covering this?

39:17.639 --> 39:19.360
<i>Poor people don't buy papers?</i>

39:19.480 --> 39:21.550
People don't buy papers, period, Kent.

39:21.719 --> 39:22.896
Perry, when you assign a story,

39:22.920 --> 39:24.559
you're making a choice about who matters.

39:24.679 --> 39:26.193
And who's worth it.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.793
Good morning, Smallville.

39:27.960 --> 39:31.588
The American conscience died
with Robert, Martin, and John.

39:31.800 --> 39:32.949
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

39:34.719 --> 39:37.836
No match. My guys in the crime lab
never seen one before.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.436
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with them.

39:41.599 --> 39:44.432
Recovered from the scene
of the firefight in the desert.

39:44.599 --> 39:46.715
Not sold anywhere
commercially in the world,

39:46.880 --> 39:47.914
even black market.

39:48.079 --> 39:49.079
<i>So?</i>

39:49.320 --> 39:51.072
So who gave prototype military rounds

39:51.280 --> 39:52.759
to Tuareg fighters in the Sahara?

39:52.920 --> 39:54.318
You're the reporter. Tell me.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.175
I think that the US government
is arming the rebels

39:56.199 --> 39:58.016
<i>while claiming to support
the elected government.</i>

39:58.039 --> 39:59.518
The Ask, Lois.

40:04.519 --> 40:06.280
Flight to D.C. tonight.
Couple of days there.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.798
Go.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.996
Coach. No extra legroom.

40:12.760 --> 40:13.954
Economy plus.

40:14.119 --> 40:15.155
Coach!

40:16.599 --> 40:18.670
So, why didn't you tell me?

40:21.840 --> 40:23.114
You're digging up snakes, Lo.

40:24.320 --> 40:25.833
It's kind of dangerous.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.911
That is why I didn't tell you.

40:28.119 --> 40:29.880
Lane, don't you
have a plane to catch?

40:30.599 --> 40:31.635
Yes, sir.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.628
Benefit for the Library of Metropolis.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.711
Someone on the committee
requested that Clark Kent cover it.

40:38.880 --> 40:41.791
Probably some old charity crone
who's got a thing for nerds.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.514
<i>Senator.</i>

40:54.719 --> 40:56.199
Little bourbon before lunch?

40:56.360 --> 40:58.315
My driver's outside. I can't stay.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.708
No bourbon?

41:00.320 --> 41:01.753
Kentucky girl like yourself?

41:02.960 --> 41:03.960
Hmm.

41:04.440 --> 41:07.237
My dad always said that Kentucky mash

41:07.440 --> 41:09.351
was the secret to health.

41:09.519 --> 41:10.952
Mmm.

41:11.920 --> 41:13.353
This was his room.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.952
I kept it just the same.

41:19.360 --> 41:20.360
Mmm.

41:23.159 --> 41:26.630
"Maybe one day Dad'll come back
if I just keep everything the same."

41:27.119 --> 41:28.393
That is silly.

41:30.239 --> 41:32.434
The magical thinking of orphan boys.

41:32.599 --> 41:35.034
I'm blocking the import
license for your mineral.

41:42.880 --> 41:44.552
The redcapes are coming.

41:46.239 --> 41:48.150
The redcapes are coming.

41:48.679 --> 41:49.829
Hmm...

41:52.719 --> 41:54.119
You and your hearings.

41:58.079 --> 42:00.639
Galloping through the streets to warn us.

42:02.599 --> 42:05.797
One if by land, two if by air.

42:06.039 --> 42:07.108
Mmm.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.956
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

42:15.159 --> 42:16.159
Can I call you June?

42:16.320 --> 42:17.798
You can call me whatever you like.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.672
Take a bucket of piss and
call it Granny's Peach Tea.

42:21.880 --> 42:22.880
Mmm-hmm.

42:23.159 --> 42:25.958
Take a weapon of assassination
and call it deterrence.

42:28.239 --> 42:29.753
You won't fool a fly or me.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.353
I'm not gonna drink it.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.755
You don't think Dad would mind, do you?

42:40.920 --> 42:45.675
If I changed just...
Just one thing in this room?

42:48.159 --> 42:50.434
Because that should be upside-down.

42:52.719 --> 42:54.630
We know better now, don't we?

42:54.840 --> 42:57.876
The devils don't come
from Hell beneath us. No.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.313
No, they come from the sky.

44:57.239 --> 44:58.239
Oh.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.277
I hope the next generation of Waynes

45:00.440 --> 45:02.510
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.

45:04.440 --> 45:07.476
Not that there's likely
to be a next generation.

45:08.760 --> 45:09.795
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

45:13.119 --> 45:16.271
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

45:16.679 --> 45:19.114
Two mentions of business
with the White Portuguese.

45:19.320 --> 45:22.072
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data

45:22.280 --> 45:25.317
to the personal residence
of Alexander Luthor.

45:25.480 --> 45:28.755
You think Lex Luthor
is the White Portuguese?

45:30.480 --> 45:33.789
I can't see that he needs the income
from imported arms.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.376
Regardless, I'll need to put
a leech at his house,

45:35.400 --> 45:36.548
and I'm gonna need the suit.

45:36.719 --> 45:38.675
The Bat interrogated six people

45:38.920 --> 45:40.672
and came away with nothing.

45:42.480 --> 45:44.630
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

45:44.840 --> 45:47.797
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

45:47.960 --> 45:49.472
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

45:51.599 --> 45:52.918
He's been invited.

47:05.599 --> 47:07.079
Who's that?

47:08.400 --> 47:10.755
You must be new to
the "let them eat cake" beat.

47:10.920 --> 47:12.512
That is Bruce Wayne.

47:13.599 --> 47:15.829
<i>Philanthropist, bibliophile...</i>

47:16.039 --> 47:19.077
True friend of the Library of Metropolis.

47:19.239 --> 47:20.639
Mr. Lex Luthor.

47:21.039 --> 47:23.235
Me? Ah. Okay.

47:27.639 --> 47:29.231
Nicky. Uh...

47:29.880 --> 47:31.552
<i>You're embarrassing me.
Um...</i>

47:32.239 --> 47:33.592
<i>Speech, speech. Uh...</i>

47:34.280 --> 47:35.429
<i>Blah, blah, blah. Uh...</i>

47:36.599 --> 47:37.599
<i>Open bar.</i>

47:38.559 --> 47:39.992
<i>The end.</i>

47:40.559 --> 47:42.152
<i>Uh...</i>

47:43.239 --> 47:45.992
The word "philanthropist"
comes from the Greek.

47:46.159 --> 47:47.797
Meaning a lover of humanity.

47:48.679 --> 47:50.909
<i>It was coined about 2,500 years ago.</i>

47:51.079 --> 47:52.637
All right. Where am I going, Alfred?

47:52.800 --> 47:54.791
Go past the elevator.

47:54.960 --> 47:56.278
Do a left.

47:57.119 --> 47:58.235
<i>That's right, must be.</i>

47:59.280 --> 48:01.110
<i>It's in the service corridor
in the basement.</i>

48:01.280 --> 48:02.632
<i>Go down the stairs.</i>

48:02.800 --> 48:05.393
<i>Gods and men.
Prometheus went with us.</i>

48:05.559 --> 48:08.119
And he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy mankind,

48:08.320 --> 48:09.920
and for that he was given a thunderbolt.

48:11.199 --> 48:13.155
<i>Hmm, that seems unfair.</i>

48:14.239 --> 48:16.150
<i>On a serious note,
the Library of Metropolis...</i>

48:16.320 --> 48:18.295
Go to the stairs. You saw them
on your way in. Down the stairs.

48:18.320 --> 48:21.471
<i>But at one time,
Dad could not buy them. No.</i>

48:21.639 --> 48:23.135
<i>My father could not afford
books growing up.</i>

48:23.159 --> 48:25.559
<i>He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.</i>

48:28.079 --> 48:29.880
All right.
You got the kitchens on your right.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.278
<i>Do a left.</i>

48:32.440 --> 48:34.440
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.

48:50.639 --> 48:51.992
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

48:53.239 --> 48:54.639
I just...

48:55.000 --> 48:57.355
I thought the bathroom was down here.
I must have...

48:58.159 --> 49:01.516
That last martini was
two too many, I think.

49:01.679 --> 49:02.998
Men's room is upstairs.

49:03.159 --> 49:04.275
Great. I'm okay.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.918
I like those shoes.

49:10.800 --> 49:13.313
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

49:13.719 --> 49:15.199
<i>Go upstairs and socialize.</i>

49:15.360 --> 49:17.827
Some young lady from Metropolis
will make you honest.

49:19.119 --> 49:21.554
In your dreams, Alfred.

49:22.239 --> 49:23.719
<i>Books are knowledge,</i>

49:23.880 --> 49:26.552
and knowledge is power,
and I am...

49:27.400 --> 49:28.833
No. Uh, um...

49:29.000 --> 49:31.719
No. What am I? I...
What was I saying? No.

49:34.079 --> 49:35.432
The bittersweet pain among men

49:35.599 --> 49:38.512
is having knowledge with
no power, because...

49:39.559 --> 49:41.675
Because that is paradoxical!
And, um...

49:44.840 --> 49:46.751
Thank you for coming.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.547
<i>Please drink. Drink.</i>

49:58.880 --> 50:02.838
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne?
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.956
My foundation has
already issued a statement

50:05.119 --> 50:07.076
in support of books.

50:07.239 --> 50:08.434
- Sir?
- Um...

50:09.679 --> 50:12.068
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me. All right?

50:12.719 --> 50:14.760
What's your position on
the Bat vigilante in Gotham?

50:16.760 --> 50:19.512
<i>Daily Planet.</i> Do I own this one?
Or is that the other guy?

50:19.719 --> 50:22.871
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.

50:23.079 --> 50:24.320
Good people are living in fear.

50:27.119 --> 50:29.235
Don't believe everything you hear, son.

50:29.400 --> 50:32.789
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.

50:35.960 --> 50:39.077
<i>The Daily Planet</i> criticizing
those who think they're above the law

50:39.239 --> 50:42.277
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?

50:43.400 --> 50:45.960
Considering every time
your hero saves a cat out of a tree,

50:46.119 --> 50:48.269
you write a puff piece editorial

50:48.480 --> 50:51.039
about an alien who, if he wanted to,

50:51.199 --> 50:52.871
could burn the whole place down.

50:53.960 --> 50:56.713
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we could do to stop him.

50:58.760 --> 51:01.797
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

51:01.960 --> 51:04.519
Maybe it's the Gotham City in me.

51:04.679 --> 51:08.275
We just have a bad history
with freaks dressed like clowns.

51:10.480 --> 51:11.958
<i>Boys! Um!</i>

51:12.119 --> 51:14.474
Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ha!

51:14.639 --> 51:16.471
I love it.
I love bringing people together.

51:16.639 --> 51:17.639
How are we?

51:17.920 --> 51:19.398
- Lex.
- Hello. Good.

51:19.559 --> 51:21.755
Hi, hello, Lex, it is a pleasure.

51:21.920 --> 51:22.989
Wow! That is a good grip!

51:23.159 --> 51:26.231
You should not pick a fight
with this person.

51:26.400 --> 51:28.815
So, after all these years,
we finally got you over to Metropolis.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.400
Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.

51:30.519 --> 51:31.519
Well, you're welcome.

51:31.719 --> 51:32.896
You should hop the harbor
more often, though.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.079
I'd love to show you my labs.

51:34.159 --> 51:36.195
Maybe we could partner on something.

51:36.679 --> 51:38.829
My R and D is up to all sorts of no good.

51:43.599 --> 51:44.748
That's seven minutes.

51:44.920 --> 51:46.831
<i>Looks like the transfer's complete.</i>

51:47.360 --> 51:48.509
- Mr. Luthor.
- Yes?

51:48.679 --> 51:50.351
- The governor.
- Governor.

51:50.519 --> 51:51.838
- Excuse me.
- Next time.

51:52.039 --> 51:53.039
Governor! Hi!

51:53.199 --> 51:55.077
Lex, it's good to see you.

52:33.480 --> 52:34.480
Excuse me.

53:40.679 --> 53:43.068
<i>We, as a population on this planet,</i>

53:43.320 --> 53:44.559
<i>have been looking for a savior.</i>

53:44.639 --> 53:46.949
<i>90% of people believe in a higher power,</i>

53:47.159 --> 53:48.434
<i>and every religion believes</i>

53:48.599 --> 53:50.476
<i>in some sort of messianic figure.</i>

53:50.639 --> 53:53.632
<i>And when this savior character
actually comes to Earth,</i>

53:53.800 --> 53:55.835
<i>we want to make him abide by our rules?</i>

53:56.039 --> 53:57.996
<i>We have to understand that
this a paradigm shift.</i>

53:58.159 --> 54:00.548
<i>We have to start thinking
beyond politics.</i>

54:00.719 --> 54:03.280
<i>Are there any moral
constraints on this person?</i>

54:03.400 --> 54:05.231
<i>We have international law.</i>

54:05.400 --> 54:08.119
<i>On this Earth,
every act is a political act.</i>

54:08.320 --> 54:10.197
<i>Is it really surprising</i>

54:10.360 --> 54:12.590
<i>that the most powerful man in the world</i>

54:12.760 --> 54:15.228
<i>should be a figure of controversy?</i>

54:16.039 --> 54:18.507
<i>Uh, to have
an individual engaging</i>

54:18.679 --> 54:20.715
<i>in these state-level interventions</i>

54:20.880 --> 54:22.233
<i>should give us all pause.</i>

54:23.000 --> 54:24.896
<i>Human beings
have a horrible track record</i>

54:24.920 --> 54:27.434
<i>of following people with great power</i>

54:27.599 --> 54:30.831
<i>down paths that led to
huge human atrocities.</i>

54:31.000 --> 54:33.639
<i>We have always
created icons in our own image.</i>

54:33.800 --> 54:37.110
<i>What we've done is
we project ourselves onto him.</i>

54:37.280 --> 54:40.795
<i>The fact is, maybe he's not
some sort of devil or Jesus character.</i>

54:41.000 --> 54:43.230
<i>Maybe he's just a guy
trying to do the right thing.</i>

54:43.400 --> 54:46.358
<i>We're talking
about a being whose very existence</i>

54:46.519 --> 54:50.353
<i>challenges our own
sense of priority in the universe.</i>

54:51.159 --> 54:52.387
<i>And you go back to Copernicus,</i>

54:52.599 --> 54:53.952
<i>where he restored the Sun</i>

54:54.119 --> 54:55.559
<i>in the center of the known universe,</i>

54:55.639 --> 54:56.914
<i>displacing Earth.</i>

54:57.079 --> 54:58.797
<i>And you get to Darwinian evolution,</i>

54:58.960 --> 55:00.916
<i>and you find out we're not
special on this Earth,</i>

55:01.079 --> 55:03.878
<i>we're just one among other lifeforms.</i>

55:04.039 --> 55:05.518
<i>And now we learn that we're not even</i>

55:05.679 --> 55:09.275
<i>special in the entire universe
because there is Superman.</i>

55:10.199 --> 55:13.670
<i>There he is. An alien among us.</i>

55:13.840 --> 55:14.954
<i>We're not alone.</i>

55:15.880 --> 55:17.949
<i>Are you,
as a United States senator,</i>

55:18.119 --> 55:22.398
<i>personally comfortable saying
to a grieving parent,</i>

55:22.559 --> 55:26.074
<i>"Superman could have saved your child,</i>

55:26.239 --> 55:30.199
<i>"but on principle,
we did not want him to act"?</i>

55:30.360 --> 55:32.112
<i>I'm not saying he shouldn't act.</i>

55:32.280 --> 55:34.077
<i>I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally.</i>

55:34.239 --> 55:36.275
<i>What are we talking about here, then?</i>

55:36.440 --> 55:38.907
<i>Must there be a Superman?</i>

55:41.400 --> 55:42.514
<i>There is.</i>

55:55.280 --> 55:56.280
<i>Hello?</i>

55:56.760 --> 55:57.795
<i>Mom?</i>

55:58.000 --> 55:59.193
Clark!

56:00.360 --> 56:02.590
What is it? What's wrong?

56:02.760 --> 56:04.751
<i>No. Nothing. I just...</i>

56:07.920 --> 56:09.273
Hi.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.480
Hi.

56:15.159 --> 56:16.797
How come Dad never left Kansas?

56:21.119 --> 56:22.791
Well, he just...

56:23.280 --> 56:24.793
You know how he was.

56:25.440 --> 56:27.237
"What do I need to travel for?

56:27.440 --> 56:29.112
"I'm already there."

56:31.320 --> 56:32.878
Just wish it was more simple.

56:35.719 --> 56:37.072
My baby boy.

56:38.920 --> 56:41.275
Nothing was ever simple.

56:48.599 --> 56:50.157
An odd little duck.

56:52.599 --> 56:53.599
<i>Hmm!</i>

56:53.840 --> 56:55.199
I've never seen a metal like this.

56:57.159 --> 57:00.152
Could be DARPA black box.

57:00.320 --> 57:01.833
Who could find out?

57:02.000 --> 57:03.717
Nobody who'd want to.

57:03.880 --> 57:06.518
Maybe they gave them
out to the rebels to test in theater.

57:06.679 --> 57:08.829
Using live soldiers as guinea pigs?

57:09.840 --> 57:12.070
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.

57:12.639 --> 57:13.960
Stuff like this still shocks you.

57:36.920 --> 57:39.387
It don't come off!
It don't come off!

57:40.079 --> 57:41.353
Prisoner transfer!

57:42.039 --> 57:44.634
You can't put me in general, man.
They gonna kill me.

57:44.800 --> 57:45.936
Hey, you can't bring me to general.

57:45.960 --> 57:47.695
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis

57:47.719 --> 57:49.039
for taking in your branded ass.

57:49.199 --> 57:50.416
- Sign here, please.
- I'm marked, man.

57:50.440 --> 57:51.856
You know what they do
to people with this on them?

57:51.880 --> 57:53.255
He's only a criminal.

57:53.280 --> 57:55.079
- This way! Let's go!
- They're gonna kill me!

57:55.440 --> 57:57.119
<i>- They're gonna kill me!</i>
- Let's go!

57:57.239 --> 57:59.594
Keefe. You made bail.

57:59.760 --> 58:00.795
Open two.

58:06.519 --> 58:07.668
Who paid?

58:19.840 --> 58:21.239
Who the hell are you?

58:26.800 --> 58:27.800
Just a man.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.355
Yeah? Well, what the fuck do you want?

58:35.400 --> 58:36.679
To help you stand for something.

58:42.119 --> 58:43.552
Your three o'clock's here.

58:53.559 --> 58:55.949
He made me half a man.

58:57.920 --> 59:01.628
My wife walked out on me.

59:04.039 --> 59:07.112
I can't even piss standing up.

59:08.280 --> 59:09.793
<i>Let me face him.</i>

59:11.960 --> 59:13.153
You'll take care of it?

59:14.960 --> 59:16.108
Good.

59:41.800 --> 59:42.914
What?

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.793
Wrong room, miss.

01:00:03.239 --> 01:00:04.275
Secretary Swanwick,

01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:06.159
you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.275
Miss Lane, if you'd like an interview,

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.829
Major Farris is just outside that door.

01:00:13.039 --> 01:00:14.871
You're treating me like a stranger?

01:00:16.519 --> 01:00:18.112
I'm treating you like a reporter.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.153
All right. Is the US providing
experimental military arms

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.355
to rebels in Africa?

01:00:24.039 --> 01:00:26.429
You know, with balls like yours,

01:00:26.639 --> 01:00:28.358
you belong in here.

01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:31.199
What's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

01:00:31.719 --> 01:00:33.710
No, not tin. But it's metal.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.552
Fired in the Superman incident.

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:39.076
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.
We haven't been told the truth.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.394
Here's the truth.

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:43.239
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she shouldn't have.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.391
Superman acted like some rogue combatant

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:47.197
to rescue her, and people died.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.918
Don't invent a conspiracy
theory to put back his halo.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.389
Or yours.

01:00:54.599 --> 01:00:55.918
- Major.
<i>- Sir.</i>

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.193
<i>So.</i>

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.237
I logged into your Dropbox to find copy.

01:01:01.039 --> 01:01:02.358
There's copy all right.

01:01:03.679 --> 01:01:06.398
But nothing about football.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.755
Nothing about the friends
of the Metropolis Library,

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.478
just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing

01:01:13.639 --> 01:01:15.152
I told you not to pursue.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.760
If the police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.135
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

01:01:19.159 --> 01:01:21.753
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.788
And so could you if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.996
WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

01:01:29.199 --> 01:01:32.077
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!

01:01:34.639 --> 01:01:37.358
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

01:01:39.599 --> 01:01:41.351
<i>So apparently Superman</i>

01:01:41.519 --> 01:01:43.559
<i>doesn't want us to think of him
as American anymore.</i>

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.954
<i>And really, why would we?</i>

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:46.951
<i>Aside from the red and blue costume.</i>

01:01:47.119 --> 01:01:48.791
<i>And, I don't know, the fact that he has</i>

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.275
<i>one-third of the USA's
initials on his chest.</i>

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.016
<i>I assume the only reason he's not wearing</i>

01:01:53.039 --> 01:01:55.235
<i>the Declaration of
Independence as a cape is...</i>

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.239
<i>He thinks it's too on-the-nose.</i>

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.199
<i>- What is going on back here?</i>
- No.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.793
Guys, come on. Let's go.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.255
<i>Get yourselves together and get out there.</i>

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.576
<i>Get those glasses on those trays.</i>

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:04.880
<i>We got thirsty people out there.</i>

01:02:14.039 --> 01:02:15.393
I wonder, would you excuse us?

01:02:15.559 --> 01:02:17.679
- There's something I'd like to show you.
- I'm sorry.

01:02:18.719 --> 01:02:21.836
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.831
But I believe it's the action

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.992
perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.429
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

01:02:32.679 --> 01:02:35.637
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.951
It's the Sword of Alexander.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.273
It's the blade that cut the Gordian knot.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:46.998
It's a triumph.

01:02:47.199 --> 01:02:48.349
Yes.

01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:50.197
<i>- Enjoy.
- Thank you.</i>

01:02:57.639 --> 01:02:59.197
It's a fake.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.994
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

01:03:02.239 --> 01:03:03.275
And now it hangs...

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.317
Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.278
Excuse me.

01:03:11.519 --> 01:03:13.396
Excuse me, miss.

01:03:13.639 --> 01:03:16.791
The other night you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.358
Stealing's not polite.

01:03:19.079 --> 01:03:21.719
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.038
Who are you?

01:03:25.199 --> 01:03:27.713
Someone interested
in the same man you are.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.233
Is that right?

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.675
I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph
that belongs to me.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.159
Did you get it?

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.032
As it happens, no, I didn't.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.717
The data you copied has
military-grade encryption.

01:03:42.239 --> 01:03:44.434
You know, I bet with that dress,

01:03:44.599 --> 01:03:47.239
9 out of 10 men will let you
get away with anything.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.628
But you're the 10th?

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.398
I'm guessing I'm the first

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.237
to see through that
babe-in-the-woods act.

01:03:54.639 --> 01:03:56.231
You don't know me,

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.992
but I've known a few women like you.

01:04:01.599 --> 01:04:03.909
I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.

01:04:06.079 --> 01:04:08.594
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.

01:04:09.239 --> 01:04:11.958
Born with no natural
inclination to share.

01:04:13.159 --> 01:04:16.277
I didn't steal your drive. I borrowed it.

01:04:17.599 --> 01:04:20.512
You'll find it in the glove
compartment of your car.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.914
Mr. Wayne.

01:06:16.119 --> 01:06:17.393
Did you get it?

01:06:17.559 --> 01:06:18.559
The rock?

01:06:18.719 --> 01:06:19.947
Yeah, we got it.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.034
I'm sorry.

01:06:48.719 --> 01:06:51.632
Get down! Get down now!

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.594
No!

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.193
She was my world.

01:09:06.038 --> 01:09:07.871
And you took her from me.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.270
<i>Bruce!</i>

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.318
Bruce! Listen to me now!

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.073
It's Lois!

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.234
It's Lois Lane!

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.787
<i>She's the key!</i>

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.279
Am I too soon?

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.273
I'm too soon!

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.511
<i>You're right about him!</i>

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.591
<i>You've always been right about him!</i>

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.113
Fear him! Fear him!

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.872
Find us, Bruce!

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.557
<i>You have to find us!</i>

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.676
<i>The</i> White Portuguese <i>is not a man.</i>

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:00.988
<i>It's a ship.</i>

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.832
Master Wayne, since the age of seven

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.877
you have been to the art of deception

01:11:09.039 --> 01:11:11.507
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.716
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.

01:11:17.359 --> 01:11:20.351
The <i>White Portuguese</i> is not
carrying a dirty bomb.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.918
<i>What is it carrying?</i>

01:11:23.199 --> 01:11:24.474
It's a weapon.

01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:26.872
It's a rock.

01:11:27.039 --> 01:11:30.315
A mineral capable of weakening
Kryptonian cells.

01:11:30.479 --> 01:11:32.239
<i>The first sample big enough
to mean something</i>

01:11:32.399 --> 01:11:34.435
turned up in the Indian Ocean
three months ago.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.231
It is now aboard the <i>White Portuguese</i>

01:11:36.439 --> 01:11:38.715
being delivered to Lex Luthor.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.472
Who I am going to steal it from.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.516
To keep it out of Luthor's hands.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.078
To destroy it.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.708
No.

01:11:49.479 --> 01:11:51.356
You're gonna go to war?

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:56.237
That son of a bitch brought
the war to us two years ago.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.115
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead.
Thousands of people.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.239
What's next? Millions?

01:12:05.439 --> 01:12:08.078
He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race,

01:12:08.239 --> 01:12:10.800
and if we believe there's even
a 1 % chance that he is our enemy,

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.029
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.393
And we have to destroy him.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.829
But he is not our enemy.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.273
Not today.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.716
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

01:12:23.479 --> 01:12:25.390
We've seen what promises are worth.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.192
How many good guys are left.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.278
How many stayed that way.

01:12:34.319 --> 01:12:35.752
14 hours.

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:40.948
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.279
I'm trying to find out
what happened to an inmate,

01:12:47.479 --> 01:12:48.548
a Santos.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.557
I can't give out that information.

01:13:08.199 --> 01:13:09.474
Mommy!

01:13:13.119 --> 01:13:14.314
Mrs. Santos?

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.677
<i>May I ask you a few questions?</i>

01:13:18.199 --> 01:13:21.475
He wasn't my husband.
But I know what he did.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.597
But he was a father. He was that, too.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.436
They took him out of Gotham Central.

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.158
They moved him to Metropolis.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.311
But inside they know.

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.875
They know the mark all over.
Guards don't care.

01:13:35.079 --> 01:13:36.399
Bat's the judge.

01:13:37.359 --> 01:13:39.190
One man decides who lives.

01:13:39.359 --> 01:13:40.917
- How is that justice?
- Talk to me.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.875
- Help me change it.
- With what? Your pen?

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.994
A man like that, words don't stop him.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.432
You know stops him? A fist.

01:13:55.119 --> 01:13:56.479
<i>Kent, I want
to talk to you.</i>

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.198
Kent!

01:14:00.359 --> 01:14:02.350
Where does he go?
Where does he go, Jenny?

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.038
I don't... I don't know.

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:07.431
Clicks his heels three times,
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.

01:14:09.239 --> 01:14:10.434
Son of a...

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.069
<i>Turn it! Turn it!</i>

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.158
Move out!

01:15:46.239 --> 01:15:47.239
Go, go, go, go!

01:16:26.479 --> 01:16:27.673
No!

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.828
Where is he?

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.274
Next time they shine
your light in the sky,

01:19:16.479 --> 01:19:18.118
don't go to it.

01:19:18.279 --> 01:19:20.635
The Bat is dead. Bury it.

01:19:22.279 --> 01:19:23.554
Consider this mercy.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.109
<i>Tell me.</i>

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.993
<i>Do you bleed?</i>

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:43.038
<i>You will.</i>

01:21:25.279 --> 01:21:28.158
I don't have a halo over me,
Mr. Secretary.

01:21:28.359 --> 01:21:29.997
I went into the desert, people died.

01:21:30.279 --> 01:21:31.952
It keeps me awake. It should.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.640
If you think that Superman is a murderer,

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.319
then throw it away.

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.591
But I don't believe you think that.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.476
<i>How do we determine
what's good?</i>

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.712
In a democracy, good is a conversation,

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.800
<i>not a unilateral decision.</i>

01:21:55.199 --> 01:21:58.271
So I urge Superman to come

01:21:58.439 --> 01:21:59.997
<i>to this Hill of the People tomorrow</i>

01:22:00.159 --> 01:22:01.797
<i>to see those who have suffered.</i>

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:05.313
<i>The world needs to know
what happened in that desert.</i>

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.512
<i>And to know what he stands for.</i>

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.670
<i>How far will he take his power?</i>

01:22:12.319 --> 01:22:16.029
<i>Does he act by our will or by his own?</i>

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:26.752
<i>People hate
what they don't understand.</i>

01:22:28.399 --> 01:22:32.029
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.671
You're not a killer, a threat.

01:22:38.359 --> 01:22:40.350
I never wanted this world to have you.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.515
Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.309
Be their angel.
Be anything they need you to be.

01:22:52.199 --> 01:22:53.872
Or be none of it.

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:57.595
You don't owe this world a thing.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.557
You never did.

01:23:03.399 --> 01:23:06.198
<i>This is DeNiros.
Transfer available to Kane Avenue.</i>

01:23:06.359 --> 01:23:07.712
<i>Please, mind your step.</i>

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.829
<i>I have to speak to the senator today.</i>

01:23:40.079 --> 01:23:41.496
<i>You cannot see the senator today.</i>

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.136
<i>I need to speak to her
before the hearing.</i>

01:23:43.159 --> 01:23:44.760
<i>Do you understand how important this is?</i>

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.496
<i>I cannot let you see the senator.</i>

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.112
<i>Please, I need to speak to her.</i>

01:23:48.319 --> 01:23:51.118
<i>Please, madam. I beg of you!
Please don't do this!</i>

01:23:51.279 --> 01:23:52.554
<i>This is so important!</i>

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.439
<i>- Come with me.
- Don't touch me!</i>

01:23:55.319 --> 01:23:57.197
- Please!
- I'm sorry. She wouldn't leave.

01:23:59.239 --> 01:24:00.752
I didn't tell you the truth.

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:04.070
C.I. thinks the desert was a setup.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.676
Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.

01:24:08.199 --> 01:24:10.190
The bullet?

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.876
The metal was developed
by a private company.

01:24:20.039 --> 01:24:21.154
What company?

01:24:21.319 --> 01:24:22.435
LexCorp.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:24.948
Lex Luthor?

01:24:25.159 --> 01:24:28.072
He also had private security contractors
at the desert compound.

01:24:32.399 --> 01:24:33.719
Go on record.

01:24:34.199 --> 01:24:36.793
Not a chance. It's classified.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.873
I happen to like my job.

01:24:39.039 --> 01:24:40.109
It doesn't make sense.

01:24:40.279 --> 01:24:42.296
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,

01:24:42.319 --> 01:24:45.073
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.556
In the middle of the desert. Thank you.

01:24:57.039 --> 01:25:00.555
The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:02.876
And of course the big
unknown in all of this is

01:25:03.079 --> 01:25:04.194
will Superman show up?

01:25:04.359 --> 01:25:05.496
That is what they're really
waiting to see.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.635
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.198
Soledad O'Brien, <i>In the Moment.</i>

01:25:08.399 --> 01:25:09.469
Quick question for you.

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:11.296
You're heading in
to meet with the senators.

01:25:11.319 --> 01:25:12.547
What will you tell them?

01:25:13.079 --> 01:25:16.037
<i>I've come here
to tell them to wake up.</i>

01:25:16.199 --> 01:25:17.952
<i>This is flesh and blood.</i>

01:25:18.199 --> 01:25:19.632
<i>He has delivered a war here.</i>

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:20.840
<i>And this...</i>

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.514
<i>This is what war looks like.
I have nothing.</i>

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:27.479
<i>There are plenty of people,
sir, who would say he's their hero.</i>

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.398
<i>He is not a hero.</i>

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:32.194
Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?

01:25:32.479 --> 01:25:33.628
Right now.

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.479
An anonymous source can verify everything

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.516
I told you about what
happened in Nairomi.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.034
- An anonymous source?
- Run it.

01:25:41.239 --> 01:25:42.912
Luthor engineered the desert.

01:25:43.239 --> 01:25:45.390
It was an ambush for Superman.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.895
Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.557
<i>Yeah, and you need to think litigate.</i>

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.119
<i>If you're wrong, Luthor will
sue the paper out of existence.</i>

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.708
<i>You need proof.</i>

01:25:53.039 --> 01:25:54.314
No. It needs to run now.

01:25:54.479 --> 01:25:55.479
<i>Before the hearing.</i>

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.496
<i>If Superman knows,
it might change what he says.</i>

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.555
I am not going to risk the paper

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.233
so that you can pass notes in class

01:26:01.439 --> 01:26:02.634
to the man that rescued you.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.194
<i>He paid her?</i>

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:07.078
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

01:26:07.239 --> 01:26:08.592
Gave her a script to learn.

01:26:09.399 --> 01:26:11.277
Her parents are alive back home.

01:26:12.239 --> 01:26:14.037
But the girl's got a conscience.

01:26:14.199 --> 01:26:16.055
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater.

01:26:16.079 --> 01:26:17.079
Senator!

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:18.953
Hi, you.

01:26:19.119 --> 01:26:20.760
Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you.

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880
Uh, you know what?

01:26:22.039 --> 01:26:24.395
Mercy, you go in and make sure
no one takes my seat.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.675
So what you been up to?

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.159
I'm just here to tell my story.

01:26:27.319 --> 01:26:29.399
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

01:26:29.439 --> 01:26:31.119
but a certain junior senator from Kentucky

01:26:31.279 --> 01:26:32.474
decided to block it.

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.917
Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.

01:26:37.079 --> 01:26:38.576
Greg, why hasn't he been
getting our checks?

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.715
He is, Mr. Wayne.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.880
He gets a check from
the Victims Fund every month.

01:26:42.079 --> 01:26:43.194
He returns them.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:46.231
<i>...who lost both his legs</i>

01:26:46.399 --> 01:26:48.515
<i>in those horrific events in Metropolis</i>

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:49.948
<i>that happened two years ago.</i>

01:26:50.399 --> 01:26:51.548
Jesus.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.872
Why haven't I seen this?

01:26:55.039 --> 01:26:56.840
<i>I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.</i>

01:26:57.479 --> 01:26:59.788
<i>And there he is. Superman is here.</i>

01:27:00.079 --> 01:27:02.036
<i>He is actually
at the United States Capitol.</i>

01:27:02.319 --> 01:27:04.470
<i>This is really a historic moment.</i>

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.551
<i>Now we expect that Superman will give</i>

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.631
<i>some kind of a statement to the Senate,</i>

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.519
<i>to the American people,
and, of course, to the world.</i>

01:27:12.319 --> 01:27:13.469
He's here. He came.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.358
- He's above the Capitol.
- Ah.

01:27:16.359 --> 01:27:18.920
You are gonna be on the
hot seat in there, Junebug.

01:27:19.159 --> 01:27:22.390
I grew up on a farm.
I know how to wrestle a pig.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.399
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

01:27:26.439 --> 01:27:28.192
It's that power can be innocent.

01:27:30.399 --> 01:27:31.515
Good luck.

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.396
Oh, miss...

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.152
Rudy, she's good to go.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:20.954
Get out!

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:27.033
- Get out! Get out!
- Superman! Superman!

01:28:34.239 --> 01:28:36.079
Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:17.877
Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful to our witness

01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:19.439
for coming before us today.

01:29:21.199 --> 01:29:23.270
This is how a democracy works.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.359
We talk to each other.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:30.429
We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.

01:29:32.279 --> 01:29:35.636
<i>I have sat here before
to say that shadow interventions</i>

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.399
<i>will not be tolerated by this committee.</i>

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.595
<i>Neither will lies.</i>

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:45.109
Because today is a day for truth.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.637
Because only by speaking...

01:29:59.239 --> 01:30:03.313
Only by working together can we...

01:30:09.479 --> 01:30:10.628
Can we...

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:23.989
Can we create a free, and a...

01:30:53.199 --> 01:30:54.199
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.956
<i>We're back
at the nation's Capitol,</i>

01:31:21.199 --> 01:31:22.599
<i>where something is happening.</i>

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:41.920
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.113
Excuse me, officer.

01:31:45.159 --> 01:31:47.594
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.079
Breathe slowly and deeply.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:58.795
You're gonna be fine.

01:32:06.479 --> 01:32:09.916
Thank you.
I'm gonna need a little room to work.

01:32:11.319 --> 01:32:14.038
<i>Ma'am, it appears you've
suffered a head injury.</i>

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:17.039
I'm gonna need you
to follow my light with your eyes.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.153
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

01:33:12.319 --> 01:33:14.072
Mr. Wayne!

01:33:15.199 --> 01:33:19.318
<i>...in the Senate hearing room
where Superman was testifying.</i>

01:33:19.479 --> 01:33:22.198
<i>This is a catastrophic
situation at our nation's Capitol.</i>

01:33:22.359 --> 01:33:23.680
<i>We don't have exact numbers yet,</i>

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.916
<i>but I can tell you that
more than a dozen people</i>

01:33:26.119 --> 01:33:27.552
<i>have died in this explosion.</i>

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:28.935
<i>First responders are at the scene.</i>

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.756
<i>They are still bringing victims out.</i>

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.278
<i>Now initially, Superman was helping
bring victims out after the blast,</i>

01:33:35.439 --> 01:33:37.748
<i>but he seems to have disappeared...</i>

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.216
<i>...raising questions.</i>

01:33:39.239 --> 01:33:42.037
<i>Carrie Birmingham,
reporting live from the nation's capital.</i>

01:33:42.199 --> 01:33:45.000
<i>Capitol police are now
confirming that the blast was caused</i>

01:33:45.039 --> 01:33:47.712
<i>by an explosive device
inside the hearing room.</i>

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:15.029
<i>Run that one more time for me.</i>

01:34:15.199 --> 01:34:18.078
- Can you enhance that?
- There you go, sir.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:59.194
<i>Capitol police are confirming to CNN</i>

01:34:59.399 --> 01:35:00.752
<i>that the suspected bomber is</i>

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.951
<i>Wallace Vernon Keefe. Now these sources...</i>

01:35:03.119 --> 01:35:04.792
Clark, it's me again. Can you...

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.279
<i>...could have gotten
the explosive device into the hearing</i>

01:35:07.359 --> 01:35:09.555
<i>by concealing them inside his wheelchair.</i>

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:12.957
<i>As for Superman, he was in the room,
but obviously failed to stop him.</i>

01:35:13.119 --> 01:35:14.394
I didn't see it, Lo.

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.551
I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.159
Clark, there are people behind this.

01:35:19.279 --> 01:35:22.192
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.274
All this time,

01:35:27.119 --> 01:35:29.634
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.956
Righting wrongs for a ghost.

01:35:35.319 --> 01:35:37.515
Thinking I'm here to do good.

01:35:41.399 --> 01:35:43.310
Superman was never real.

01:35:44.279 --> 01:35:46.635
Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.

01:35:48.199 --> 01:35:51.112
That farmer's dream
is all some people have.

01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:53.994
It's all that gives them hope.

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.671
This means something.

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:09.671
It did on my world.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.309
My world doesn't exist anymore.

01:37:32.079 --> 01:37:34.070
<i>Welcome.</i>

01:37:34.279 --> 01:37:38.671
<i>Analysis reveals ship
operating at 37% efficiency.</i>

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.590
<i>Would you like to assume command?</i>

01:37:42.199 --> 01:37:43.519
Yes, I would.

01:37:44.199 --> 01:37:46.110
Yes, I would.

01:37:46.279 --> 01:37:48.793
<i>Very well. Let's begin.</i>

01:37:49.279 --> 01:37:54.114
<i>The Kryptonian archive contains knowledge
from 100,000 different worlds.</i>

01:37:54.479 --> 01:37:57.836
Good. Teach me.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.073
<i>Alexander Luthor,
your security override has been accepted.</i>

01:40:32.239 --> 01:40:35.118
<i>Genesis Chamber ready
to analyze genetic sample.</i>

01:40:38.479 --> 01:40:41.438
<i>Acknowledging presence
of genetic material.</i>

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:42.953
<i>Analyzing.</i>

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:49.474
<i>I've identified the host as
General Zod of Kandor.</i>

01:41:05.159 --> 01:41:07.878
<i>Acknowledging presence
of foreign genetic material.</i>

01:41:08.079 --> 01:41:09.637
<i>Analyzing.</i>

01:41:10.279 --> 01:41:12.555
You flew too close to the sun.

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.671
Now look at you.

01:41:18.039 --> 01:41:20.507
<i>Advising. Action forbidden.</i>

01:41:21.039 --> 01:41:23.395
<i>It has been decreed
by the Council of Krypton</i>

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:26.869
<i>that none will ever again
give life to a deformity</i>

01:41:27.039 --> 01:41:29.270
<i>so hateful to sight and memory.</i>

01:41:29.439 --> 01:41:31.510
<i>The desecration without name.</i>

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:34.520
And where is the Council of Krypton?

01:41:35.239 --> 01:41:36.354
<i>Destroyed, sir.</i>

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.993
Then proceed.

01:41:39.479 --> 01:41:40.798
<i>Very well.</i>

01:41:41.119 --> 01:41:44.270
<i>Preparing chrysalis
and commencing metamorphosis.</i>

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.551
<i>"And so we are left to wonder</i>

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:51.677
"if Superman was aware of
the threat and did nothing,

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.752
"was he then complicit
in the Capitol tragedy?"

01:41:55.039 --> 01:41:56.039
Still no Kent?

01:41:56.199 --> 01:41:57.920
<i>"His disappearance
raises questions."</i>

01:41:58.159 --> 01:41:59.194
No.

01:41:59.359 --> 01:42:01.536
<i>There are still so many
unanswered questions.</i>

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:02.628
<i>Chief among them,</i>

01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:05.512
<i>whether Superman was involved
in the planning of this attack.</i>

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.914
<i>I mean, here's an individual
who has unlimited power,</i>

01:42:08.079 --> 01:42:11.072
<i>yet did nothing to stop the bomber
just a few feet away from him.</i>

01:42:11.239 --> 01:42:12.880
<i>It just doesn't add up for investigators.</i>

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.735
<i>Burn him, burn him, burn him.</i>

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:18.274
<i>Burn him, burn him, burn him.</i>

01:42:40.359 --> 01:42:43.271
For 20 American, he didn't see you.

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.868
Same for me.

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.796
<i>Now one FBI official
familiar with this case</i>

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:01.551
<i>told me they found quote,</i>

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:05.429
<i>"A jackpot of bomb-making materials
inside Keefe's apartment. "</i>

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:07.078
<i>What they need to determine now is</i>

01:43:07.279 --> 01:43:10.476
<i>whether he had any help in the planning
and execution of the bombing.</i>

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:15.030
<i>And they haven 't ruled out the idea
that Superman was a co-conspirator.</i>

01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:17.188
<i>Now, my sources are telling me</i>

01:43:17.359 --> 01:43:20.396
<i>they are getting a barrage of anonymous
and credible tips</i>

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:25.509
<i>with all roads in this investigation
leading to the Kryptonian visitor.</i>

01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.829
All right, Lois. You gotta go.

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:23.756
He didn't know he was gonna die.

01:44:25.039 --> 01:44:26.677
He just bought groceries.

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:28.636
The wheelchair and
the bullet from the desert

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.676
were made from the same metal.

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:32.119
I know. The desert. The hearing.

01:44:32.159 --> 01:44:34.832
Everywhere Superman goes,
Luthor wants death.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.467
<i>But, Luthor goes
through all of that trouble...</i>

01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:40.837
Creates a bomb out of a wheelchair,
and then alters it to reduce the blast?

01:44:41.039 --> 01:44:42.631
What do you mean?

01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:45.359
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.038
You couldn't stop it.

01:44:49.479 --> 01:44:51.675
You couldn't see it.

01:45:34.039 --> 01:45:35.359
Something, isn't it?

01:45:37.239 --> 01:45:41.233
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,
so we come to the mountains.

01:45:42.359 --> 01:45:45.988
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.

01:45:46.159 --> 01:45:48.195
Farm at the bottom of the world.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.877
I remember one season the water came bad.

01:45:53.039 --> 01:45:55.076
I couldn't have been 12.

01:45:55.279 --> 01:45:58.158
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

01:45:58.319 --> 01:46:00.095
We worked till, I think, I fainted.

01:46:00.119 --> 01:46:01.872
But we managed to stop the water.

01:46:03.199 --> 01:46:04.837
We saved the farm.

01:46:06.239 --> 01:46:09.311
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.

01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:15.798
Later that day we found out
we blocked the water all right.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.319
We sent it upstream.

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:20.715
The whole Lang farm washed away.

01:46:22.079 --> 01:46:24.957
<i>While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.</i>

01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:30.639
I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.

01:46:34.079 --> 01:46:36.195
Did the nightmares ever stop?

01:46:38.319 --> 01:46:39.639
Yeah.

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:42.591
When I met your mother.

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:47.438
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:52.194
<i>She was my world.</i>

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:56.471
I miss you, son.

01:47:01.399 --> 01:47:03.390
I miss you too, Dad.

01:47:23.239 --> 01:47:24.832
You know you can't win this.

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:28.152
It's suicide.

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.315
I'm older now than my father ever was.

01:47:36.319 --> 01:47:39.231
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.878
20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?

01:47:44.039 --> 01:47:46.600
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:49.512
Pull one up, another grows in its place.

01:47:51.199 --> 01:47:53.872
This is about the future of the world.

01:47:55.079 --> 01:47:56.671
This is my legacy.

01:47:58.279 --> 01:48:00.270
My father sat me down right here.

01:48:00.439 --> 01:48:02.192
Told me what Wayne Manor was built on.

01:48:02.359 --> 01:48:05.988
Railroads, real estates, and oil.

01:48:06.159 --> 01:48:09.630
The first generation made their fortune
trading with the French.

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:11.391
Pelts and skins.

01:48:15.319 --> 01:48:16.992
They were hunters.

01:48:33.439 --> 01:48:36.158
So falls the house of Wayne.

01:48:37.199 --> 01:48:40.748
<i>We gotta wait for more
evidence, but the question still remains,</i>

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:42.034
<i>where is he?</i>

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.989
<i>If Superman was not involved,</i>

01:48:45.199 --> 01:48:46.474
<i>if he's got nothing to hide,</i>

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:50.274
<i>then why hasn 't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?</i>

01:48:50.439 --> 01:48:52.095
<i>You can't point a finger and...</i>

01:48:52.119 --> 01:48:54.400
<i>I'm not pointing anything, Warren.
Look. Ten fingers, see?</i>

01:48:54.439 --> 01:48:56.270
<i>If there is going to be a criminal...</i>

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.551
The night is here.

01:50:57.319 --> 01:50:58.514
Excuse me.

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:01.708
Don't I know...

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:08.673
Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.194
Lois Lane.

01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:15.153
Mmm. Come see the view.

01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:17.396
Um... Mmm-mmm.

01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:22.037
Now the secret to the height
is the building material.

01:52:22.199 --> 01:52:25.988
It's light metals
which sway a bit in the wind.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Hmm.

01:52:30.359 --> 01:52:32.015
And you know something
about LexCorp metals,

01:52:32.039 --> 01:52:33.439
don't you, Miss Lane?

01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:35.835
I've proven what you've done.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.512
Wow, you're feisty.

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:39.988
Unfortunately, that will blow away.

01:52:40.159 --> 01:52:41.672
Like sand in the desert.

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.511
You're psychotic.

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:47.149
That is a three-syllable word
for any thought too big for little minds.

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:49.671
Hmm. Next category: circles.

01:52:50.199 --> 01:52:55.149
Round and round
and round they go to find Superman.

01:52:55.319 --> 01:52:57.095
Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.

01:52:57.119 --> 01:52:58.519
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.

01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:00.671
The shortest distance
between any two points

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.511
is a straight path.

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:05.478
And I believe
the straightest path to Superman

01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.311
is a pretty little road...

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:09.475
Mmm. Called Lois Lane.

01:53:32.039 --> 01:53:33.552
You came back.

01:53:34.399 --> 01:53:35.878
You came back.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.229
Boy, do we have problems up here!

01:54:01.399 --> 01:54:03.993
The problem of... Of evil in the world.

01:54:04.159 --> 01:54:05.990
Uh, the problem of absolute virtue.

01:54:06.159 --> 01:54:08.354
I'll take you in without breaking you.

01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:10.470
Which is more than you deserve.

01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:12.595
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:13.908
You above all.

01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:16.391
Ah, because that's what God is.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.118
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.

01:54:22.319 --> 01:54:25.436
Clark Joseph Kent.

01:54:27.119 --> 01:54:30.555
See, what we call God
depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

01:54:31.319 --> 01:54:34.278
Because God is tribal. God takes sides.

01:54:34.439 --> 01:54:36.270
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

01:54:36.439 --> 01:54:39.158
to deliver me from
Daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:41.356
I figured out way back,

01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:44.837
if God is all-powerful,
he cannot be all-good.

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:49.596
And if he is all-good,
then he cannot be all-powerful.

01:54:50.359 --> 01:54:52.270
And neither can you be.

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:55.108
They need to see the fraud you are.

01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:57.391
With their eyes.

01:54:58.359 --> 01:55:00.715
The blood on your hands.

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:02.551
What have you done?

01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:04.471
Hmm. And tonight, they will.

01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.269
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date. Hmm.

01:55:08.479 --> 01:55:10.152
Across the bay.

01:55:10.319 --> 01:55:12.515
Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.

01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:14.576
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.318
Little red notes, big bang.

01:55:16.479 --> 01:55:17.832
You let your family die!

01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:24.796
<i>And now you will fly to him.
And you will battle him.</i>

01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:26.109
To the death.

01:55:27.359 --> 01:55:30.271
Black and blue. Fight Night!

01:55:31.239 --> 01:55:34.118
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

01:55:34.319 --> 01:55:36.595
God versus man.

01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:38.711
Day versus night.

01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:42.876
Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.

01:55:43.079 --> 01:55:45.149
You think I'll fight him for you?

01:55:45.359 --> 01:55:46.395
Hmm, yes, I do.

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:49.320
I think you will fight-fight-fight
for that special lady in your life.

01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:52.194
She's safe on the ground. How about you?

01:55:52.359 --> 01:55:55.113
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.

01:55:55.279 --> 01:55:56.314
No.

01:55:56.479 --> 01:55:59.789
Every boy's special lady is his mother.

01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:08.479
Martha, Martha, Martha.

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:09.880
Hmm.

01:56:10.079 --> 01:56:13.435
Why, the mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.

01:56:14.199 --> 01:56:16.713
The punishment for witches, what is that?

01:56:17.039 --> 01:56:19.234
That's right. Death by fire.

01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:22.838
Mmm.

01:56:29.119 --> 01:56:31.030
Where is she?

01:56:31.199 --> 01:56:32.880
I don't know!
I would not let them tell me!

01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:35.269
Uh-uh-uh! If you kill me, Martha dies.

01:56:35.439 --> 01:56:37.119
And if you fly away, mmm,
Martha also dies.

01:56:37.279 --> 01:56:39.998
But if you kill the Bat...

01:56:40.159 --> 01:56:41.797
Martha lives.

01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:50.029
There we go. There we go. Hmm.

01:56:52.479 --> 01:56:55.916
And now God bends to my will.

01:57:02.359 --> 01:57:04.748
Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.

01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.109
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

01:57:07.279 --> 01:57:09.953
Yes, the Almighty comes clean
about how dirty he is when it counts.

01:57:10.119 --> 01:57:11.314
To save Martha,

01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:13.711
bring me the head of the Bat.

01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.960
Ah.

01:57:18.199 --> 01:57:20.997
Mother of God, would you look at the time?

01:57:21.159 --> 01:57:23.435
When you came here, you had an hour.

01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:26.631
Now it's less.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.176
<i>Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.</i>

01:58:30.199 --> 01:58:32.239
<i>Brooke, you're live on the air.
What are you seeing?</i>

01:58:32.319 --> 01:58:33.920
There's something happening at the ship.

01:58:35.279 --> 01:58:37.668
It's sending massive power surges.

01:58:38.359 --> 01:58:40.095
<i>Police helicopters surrounding the area.</i>

01:58:40.119 --> 01:58:42.475
<i>They've created a barricade
around this containment center.</i>

01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:44.176
<i>And we're trying to get
a little bit closer here</i>

01:58:44.199 --> 01:58:45.474
<i>to find out what's going on.</i>

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:46.873
<i>It is absolute chaos.</i>

01:58:47.039 --> 01:58:49.679
<i>You can see that lightning,
those surges of electricity.</i>

01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:52.559
<i>They seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.</i>

01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:53.993
<i>Daily Planet.</i>

01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:56.828
Lois.

01:58:58.079 --> 01:59:00.039
I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

01:59:00.199 --> 01:59:01.199
Who?

01:59:03.399 --> 01:59:05.595
Or he has to die.

01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:06.760
Clark.

01:59:10.079 --> 01:59:12.389
No one stays good in this world.

01:59:21.199 --> 01:59:25.033
<i>But as of right now, much of
the city remains in the dark tonight.</i>

01:59:25.199 --> 01:59:26.199
<i>Much chaos.</i>

01:59:26.439 --> 01:59:29.351
<i>Much confusing happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.</i>

01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:31.336
<i>Those helicopters are still
surrounding the area.</i>

01:59:31.359 --> 01:59:34.158
<i>I don't know if you can
still see those bolts of lightning...</i>

02:01:36.039 --> 02:01:41.238
<i>2400 hours and 2 minutes.
Subject declining rapidly.</i>

02:01:41.399 --> 02:01:43.310
<i>All procedural interventions have failed.</i>

02:01:48.239 --> 02:01:50.439
<i>Outcome will be death.</i>

02:01:58.199 --> 02:02:01.112
<i>Dr. Silas Stone
suspending all clinical protocol.</i>

02:02:01.279 --> 02:02:07.719
<i>US Gov, object 6-19-82
is successfully activated.</i>

02:02:29.159 --> 02:02:30.752
<i>I need a chopper to Gotham.</i>

02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:31.920
Call the heliport.

02:02:32.079 --> 02:02:33.877
Chopper? We can barely afford a bicycle.

02:02:34.039 --> 02:02:35.917
You wanna chase a story? Go to the ship.

02:02:36.079 --> 02:02:37.439
Superman's probably there already.

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:40.557
Perry, it's not for a story.

02:02:45.279 --> 02:02:46.759
Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.

02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:49.632
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the goddamn roof.

02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:51.113
On the roof, Lois!

02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:55.153
Where are we headed?

02:02:55.319 --> 02:02:56.435
There!

02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:15.478
<i>Well, here I am.</i>

02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:18.432
Bruce. Please.

02:03:20.079 --> 02:03:23.072
I was wrong. You have to listen to me.

02:03:23.239 --> 02:03:24.514
Lex wants us to...

02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:42.079
You don't understand.

02:03:42.239 --> 02:03:43.752
There's no time!

02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:46.153
<i>I understand.</i>

02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:04.278
Stay down!

02:05:04.439 --> 02:05:06.748
If I wanted it, you'd be dead already.

02:05:44.279 --> 02:05:46.077
<i>Breathe it in.</i>

02:05:49.039 --> 02:05:50.951
<i>That's fear.</i>

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:55.077
<i>You're not brave.</i>

02:05:59.279 --> 02:06:00.917
<i>Men are brave.</i>

02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:54.354
<i>I bet your parents taught you
that you mean something.</i>

02:09:55.199 --> 02:09:57.030
<i>That you're here for a reason.</i>

02:09:58.359 --> 02:10:01.396
<i>My parents taught me a different lesson,</i>

02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:03.918
<i>dying in the gutter</i>

02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:06.710
<i>for no reason at all.</i>

02:10:23.279 --> 02:10:25.747
<i>They taught me the world only makes sense</i>

02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:27.951
<i>if you force it to.</i>

02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.636
<i>You were never a God.</i>

02:11:11.359 --> 02:11:13.315
<i>You were never even a man.</i>

02:11:20.119 --> 02:11:23.635
You're letting him kill Martha.

02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:30.916
<i>What does that mean?</i>

02:11:32.119 --> 02:11:33.837
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:37.474
Find him.

02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:40.153
Save

02:11:40.479 --> 02:11:42.152
<i>Martha.</i>

02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:46.471
<i>Martha.</i>

02:12:17.359 --> 02:12:19.350
Martha.

02:12:23.479 --> 02:12:24.753
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:28.192
<i>Martha! Why did you say that name?</i>

02:12:28.359 --> 02:12:29.838
Clark! Stop!

02:12:30.039 --> 02:12:31.189
Please! Stop!

02:12:31.359 --> 02:12:32.872
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

02:12:33.039 --> 02:12:34.597
It's his mother's name!

02:12:35.199 --> 02:12:37.350
It's his mother's name.

02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:10.159
<i>We're not getting any answers.</i>

02:13:10.199 --> 02:13:12.095
We're still right outside
the containment center.

02:13:12.119 --> 02:13:13.189
A dangerous situation.

02:13:13.359 --> 02:13:16.591
Military and police personnel
surrounding the area.

02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:33.233
<i>Luthor.</i>

02:13:33.439 --> 02:13:35.555
He wanted your life for hers.

02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:38.078
She's losing time.

02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:41.068
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

02:13:41.279 --> 02:13:42.917
It's got to be Lex.

02:13:43.079 --> 02:13:45.912
<i>They need you at that ship.
I'll find her.</i>

02:13:46.119 --> 02:13:48.429
- My mother needs me.
- Wait.

02:13:49.079 --> 02:13:51.274
<i>I'll make you a promise.</i>

02:13:51.439 --> 02:13:53.635
<i>Martha won't die tonight.</i>

02:14:20.479 --> 02:14:21.628
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:23.198
<i>Alfred.</i>

02:14:23.359 --> 02:14:26.193
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in,
but I've tracked the Russian's phone

02:14:26.359 --> 02:14:27.838
to a warehouse near the port.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.432
<i>You're locked onto it.</i>

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:31.318
<i>I don't deserve you, Alfred.</i>

02:14:31.479 --> 02:14:33.948
No, sir. You don't.

02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:56.034
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

02:14:58.159 --> 02:15:02.631
And every time we say goodbye,
you die a little.

02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:17.398
- Take it down.
- Go! Go!

02:15:41.039 --> 02:15:42.189
<i>You have to take it, Alfred.</i>

02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:44.233
Ah, right.

02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:46.756
Commencing drone mode.

02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:54.238
Thermal imaging is showing me
two dozen hostiles on the third floor.

02:15:54.399 --> 02:15:56.595
Why don't I drop you off on the second?

02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:03.918
Drop it.

02:19:04.959 --> 02:19:06.790
I said drop it!

02:19:07.879 --> 02:19:09.279
I'll kill her.

02:19:11.079 --> 02:19:13.433
Believe me, I'll do it.

02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:17.429
<i>I believe you.</i>

02:19:29.959 --> 02:19:32.190
<i>It's okay. I'm a friend of your son's.</i>

02:19:32.638 --> 02:19:34.231
I figured.

02:19:34.398 --> 02:19:35.799
The cape.

02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:05.317
"Late, late," says the White Rabbit.

02:20:05.479 --> 02:20:06.976
<i>Forty seconds to animation.</i>

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:08.478
Right, wabbit?

02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:12.468
Hmm. Out of tricks, out of time.

02:20:13.479 --> 02:20:16.119
And one Bat head short.

02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:18.510
<i>Thirty seconds to animation.</i>

02:20:18.719 --> 02:20:20.799
Ah. That'll be the cook. Excuse me.

02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:23.069
Uh, Gotham Roast. Well done.

02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:25.671
Hello. Break the bad news.

02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:28.638
<i>I'd rather do
the breaking in person.</i>

02:20:28.799 --> 02:20:30.495
<i>Twenty seconds to animation.</i>

02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:32.191
You've lost.

02:20:32.399 --> 02:20:33.913
I don't know how to lose.

02:20:34.079 --> 02:20:35.513
You'll learn.

02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:36.795
I'll learn.

02:20:36.959 --> 02:20:38.551
I don't hate the sinner.

02:20:39.079 --> 02:20:40.990
- I hate the sin.
<i>- 10 seconds to animation.</i>

02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:43.793
And yours, my friend, is existing.

02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:46.032
I cannot let you win.

02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:48.816
I gave the Bat a fighting chance to do it,
but he was not strong enough.

02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.751
So, if man won't kill God...

02:20:50.959 --> 02:20:52.677
<i>...two, one.</i>

02:20:54.479 --> 02:20:55.674
...the devil will do it!

02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:13.075
Perry!

02:21:13.399 --> 02:21:15.072
All right. Stay calm, everybody!

02:21:15.959 --> 02:21:17.799
<i>We're getting reports
there are total blackouts</i>

02:21:17.879 --> 02:21:20.757
<i>in the north and to
the northwest of the city.</i>

02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:22.056
<i>Federal authorities
are trying to determine</i>

02:21:22.079 --> 02:21:24.388
<i>if this is part of
a larger terrorist attack.</i>

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:31.558
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

02:21:32.079 --> 02:21:35.355
Hmm. Blood of my blood.

02:21:42.319 --> 02:21:44.275
Born to destroy you.

02:21:47.239 --> 02:21:48.388
Your Doomsday.

02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:17.477
Now God is good as dead.

02:22:20.399 --> 02:22:21.593
Oh!

02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:41.793
POTUS joining.

02:23:41.959 --> 02:23:42.959
Mr. President.

02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:44.335
<i>What the hell is it, Calvin?</i>

02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:46.040
<i>These are live images from the top</i>

02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:49.236
<i>of the LexCorp tower
in downtown Metropolis.</i>

02:23:49.399 --> 02:23:50.833
<i>Military aircraft are on the scene.</i>

02:24:02.639 --> 02:24:04.391
- Are you hurt, ma'am?
- I'm okay.

02:24:04.559 --> 02:24:06.231
Good. You're gonna be all right, okay?

02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:19.396
<i>This thing emerged
from the Kryptonian crash site</i>

02:24:19.559 --> 02:24:20.594
<i>just moments ago.</i>

02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:23.797
<i>Thankfully though, the work day is over
in the downtown core.</i>

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.068
<i>It's nearly empty.</i>

02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:28.877
<i>Now military aircraft.
Those are Apache helicopters.</i>

02:24:29.079 --> 02:24:31.513
<i>They have now just arrived.
The images that...</i>

02:25:07.799 --> 02:25:10.836
<i>We've, uh... We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 News.</i>

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.433
<i>Now, it's not clear what just happened.</i>

02:25:16.959 --> 02:25:18.677
<i>What's happening there, Alfred?</i>

02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:22.476
How best to describe it?

02:25:22.639 --> 02:25:24.015
<i>Metropolis airspace
has been closed briefly.</i>

02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:25.159
Excuse me?

02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:26.456
<i>We kindly ask that you stay in your seats.</i>

02:25:26.479 --> 02:25:27.674
Excuse me?

02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:29.238
Miss Prince?

02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:45.870
Sir. Look, they've cleared the city.

02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:47.296
Looks like he's taking it into space.

02:25:47.319 --> 02:25:49.015
We can go
straight to Key Red, Mr. President.

02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:50.995
Not yet. Are you crazy?

02:25:51.159 --> 02:25:53.456
They're high enough that we can nuke 'em
with no casualties, sir.

02:25:53.479 --> 02:25:56.870
One casualty, Mr. President. Superman.

02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:00.512
<i>God have mercy on us all.</i>

02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:08.838
- Key is hot.
- Key is hot.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.399
Red birds are armed to deploy, sir.

02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:13.189
<i>Fire at will.</i>

02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:15.510
Three, two, one...

02:27:04.399 --> 02:27:05.913
<i>Oh, God.</i>

02:27:27.639 --> 02:27:29.436
Projectile 1. Impact.

02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:31.511
Stryker's Island, east of Metropolis.

02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:32.828
That's uninhabited.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.352
Projectile 2...

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.318
No apparent reentry.

02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:43.916
<i>Projectile 2?</i>

02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:49.513
Superman, Mr. President.
Projectile 2 was Superman.

02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:51.791
Sir.

02:27:51.959 --> 02:27:53.109
It's moving.

02:28:34.399 --> 02:28:36.230
<i>The shockwaves are getting stronger.</i>

02:28:36.399 --> 02:28:39.471
Every time we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:40.795
We can't attack.

02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:43.989
<i>What are you saying, Calvin?</i>

02:28:44.159 --> 02:28:46.389
I'm saying it's unkillable.

02:29:14.399 --> 02:29:16.515
Master Wayne, are you receiving me?

02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:17.680
<i>Alfred.</i>

02:29:17.879 --> 02:29:19.518
<i>It's Kryptonian.</i>

02:29:19.719 --> 02:29:21.835
<i>Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it.</i>

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:25.389
They might. If you had any left.

02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:27.556
<i>I got one round left.</i>

02:29:28.799 --> 02:29:32.951
<i>The spear. Alfred, the spear.
It's pure Kryptonite.</i>

02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:34.394
<i>It's back in Gotham.</i>

02:29:34.559 --> 02:29:37.393
<i>If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.</i>

02:29:37.559 --> 02:29:38.559
It would in theory.

02:29:38.719 --> 02:29:41.870
<i>I've gotta get it to chase me
back to the city.</i>

02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:43.760
<i>Back to the Kryptonite.</i>

02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:45.917
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:37.076
Why did you bring him back to the city?

02:31:37.239 --> 02:31:38.753
<i>The port is abandoned.</i>

02:31:38.920 --> 02:31:40.717
<i>There's a weapon here that can kill it.</i>

02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:54.634
Did you find the spear?

02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:57.316
<i>I've been a little busy.</i>

02:31:57.479 --> 02:32:00.676
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

02:32:02.440 --> 02:32:05.716
This thing is from another world.

02:32:06.479 --> 02:32:07.479
My world.

02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:10.831
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

02:32:11.959 --> 02:32:13.109
Is she with you?

02:32:13.959 --> 02:32:16.554
<i>I thought she was with you.</i>

02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:55.509
Clark!

02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:57.519
Clark!

02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:06.192
Clark!

02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:17.509
Clark!

02:36:18.399 --> 02:36:20.390
Clark! Are you all right?

02:36:57.639 --> 02:36:59.755
I love you.

02:37:03.079 --> 02:37:06.674
No. No, Clark, you can't.

02:37:08.239 --> 02:37:09.912
This is my world.

02:37:10.079 --> 02:37:11.513
No, Clark, don't.

02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:17.430
You are my world.

02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:18.748
No.

02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:24.509
Please. Clark!

02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:30.600
Hi.

02:44:37.799 --> 02:44:41.031
Clark had this sent here,
so he could surprise you.

02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:09.111
"The dead shall live.

02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:13.956
"My slain shall rise again.

02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:19.672
"Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust.

02:47:20.879 --> 02:47:24.350
"For thy dew is like the dew of morning.

02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:31.193
"And the earth
shall give birth to her dead."

02:47:38.719 --> 02:47:40.870
Ah, I need a ride
back to the house.

02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:43.712
I forgot my checkbook
to pay the funeral director.

02:47:43.879 --> 02:47:45.870
They said it's all taken care of.

02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:47.870
By whom?

02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:49.631
Anonymous donor.

02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:37.513
All those circuses back east
burying an empty box.

02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:39.591
They don't know how to honor him,

02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:42.591
except as a soldier.

02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:47.795
I've failed him in life.

02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:51.156
I won't fail him in death.

02:48:52.879 --> 02:48:54.438
Help me find the others like you.

02:48:55.559 --> 02:48:57.629
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

02:48:58.479 --> 02:49:01.630
They will. And they'll fight.

02:49:02.399 --> 02:49:04.868
We have to stand together.

02:49:12.159 --> 02:49:15.789
100 years ago, I walked away from mankind.

02:49:17.479 --> 02:49:20.313
From a century of horrors.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:26.788
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.149
Men are still good.

02:49:34.319 --> 02:49:37.153
<i>We fight. We kill.</i>

02:49:38.239 --> 02:49:40.594
<i>We betray one another.</i>

02:49:42.559 --> 02:49:44.754
<i>But we can rebuild.</i>

02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:47.909
<i>We can do better.</i>

02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:50.433
<i>We will.</i>

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:52.352
<i>We have to.</i>

02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:16.871
The others like me.

02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:19.031
Why did you say they'll have to fight?

02:50:24.559 --> 02:50:26.675
Just a feeling.

02:50:37.959 --> 02:50:40.632
Prisoner A-C-23-19-40.

02:50:40.799 --> 02:50:43.552
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

02:50:44.959 --> 02:50:46.836
I'm gonna say this one more time.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:50.389
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

02:50:57.600 --> 02:50:59.829
Turn around and face the wall.

02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:03.747
Place your forehead against the wall.

02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:08.152
Put your hands behind your back,
so that I can come in and restrain you.

02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:38.952
<i>Whatever you do, wherever you go,</i>

02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:41.270
<i>I'll be watching you.</i>

02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:43.359
Oh...

02:51:44.639 --> 02:51:46.436
Look at us.

02:51:47.239 --> 02:51:49.150
This is how it all caves in.

02:51:49.360 --> 02:51:54.593
Civilization on the Wayne Manor's
out the window.

02:51:55.280 --> 02:51:56.679
Mmm?

02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:01.270
But who would believe me?
I...

02:52:01.959 --> 02:52:04.349
I'm insane.

02:52:05.680 --> 02:52:07.591
I'm not even fit to stand trial.

02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:09.637
That's right.

02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:13.753
We have hospitals that treat
the mentally ill with compassion.

02:52:14.120 --> 02:52:16.917
But that's not where you're going.

02:52:17.079 --> 02:52:20.594
I arranged for you to get transferred
to Arkham Asylum in Gotham.

02:52:21.799 --> 02:52:24.268
I still have some friends there.

02:52:24.440 --> 02:52:26.236
They're expecting you.

02:52:30.479 --> 02:52:34.677
But the bell's already been rung.

02:52:37.239 --> 02:52:38.753
And they've heard it.

02:52:40.520 --> 02:52:41.918
Out in the dark.

02:52:42.120 --> 02:52:44.680
Among the stars. Hmm.

02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:51.748
Ding dong, the God is dead.

02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:03.952
But a bell cannot be unrung!

02:53:05.040 --> 02:53:08.793
He's hungry. He's found us.

02:53:09.799 --> 02:53:11.790
And he's coming!

02:53:14.680 --> 02:53:17.147
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

02:53:19.479 --> 02:53:22.358
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

02:53:24.319 --> 02:53:27.516
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

02:53:29.079 --> 02:53:30.798
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:37.037
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

02:53:38.799 --> 02:53:42.156
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>
