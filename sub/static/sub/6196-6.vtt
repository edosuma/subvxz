00:00.001 --> 00:02.138
WOMAN: Previously on "Being Mary Jane."

00:02.139 --> 00:03.359
What organization are you with again?

00:03.360 --> 00:04.894
National Council Of La Russa.

00:05.106 --> 00:07.398
We just want to make sure
everyone has a seat at the table.

00:07.400 --> 00:10.116
And by everyone, you mean Latin people.

00:10.124 --> 00:11.513
Did I miss the memo about the meeting?

00:11.515 --> 00:13.872
No, no, Marisol was simply
telling me her ideas.

00:13.942 --> 00:15.253
Was she now?

00:15.255 --> 00:17.463
It's my show, it's my audience.

00:17.465 --> 00:20.954
No, it's SNC's show, and
it's SNC's audience.

00:20.955 --> 00:22.940
Are you ready for prime time, Mary Jane?

00:22.941 --> 00:26.092
Yeah, I am ready for
prime time and I'm...

00:26.093 --> 00:28.041
happy to announce that you won't
have to wait much longer.

00:28.043 --> 00:30.447
I'll be back on the air on Monday.

00:31.119 --> 00:33.032
What you are is a pain in my ass.

00:33.565 --> 00:34.579
How you doing?

00:34.581 --> 00:37.437
You've been going through a lot
lately so I'm just checking on you.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.001
MARY JANE: Do you know that
football player I told you about?

00:39.002 --> 00:41.424
Yeah. You like him for the sex.

00:41.426 --> 00:44.591
Let him be your little
scratch for the itch, okay?

00:44.781 --> 00:47.240
Since we worked hard, you ready to play?
Want to go get some drinks?

00:47.242 --> 00:50.200
Gosh I wish, I wish but you know
now that I've moved back in

00:50.201 --> 00:52.863
with John and the kids,
I got some stuff to do.

00:52.865 --> 00:56.656
MARY JANE: My girlfriend was supposed
to join me but she just flaked.

00:56.657 --> 01:00.012
Well mind if I keep you company?

01:00.013 --> 01:02.544
Not at all.

01:02.545 --> 01:06.332
- [Laughs]
- Well you know he's skinny, right?

01:06.333 --> 01:08.471
And you know what they say
about the skinny brothas.

01:08.473 --> 01:10.715
- They be packing.
- [Laughs]

01:10.717 --> 01:14.052
Well he does love the sistas,
because when I interviewed him,

01:14.054 --> 01:16.676
I caught him looking.

01:17.557 --> 01:19.391
Do not lie on him.

01:19.393 --> 01:21.097
- I'm not lying.
- [Laughs]

01:21.098 --> 01:24.567
But I will say, I do love
his little smoker lips.

01:24.568 --> 01:25.767
And that walk.

01:25.768 --> 01:26.881
Girl,

01:26.883 --> 01:28.300
he walk more gangsta than pudding.

01:28.423 --> 01:29.423
I'm just saying.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.540
- Putin.
- Putin.

01:31.542 --> 01:33.004
I call him pudding.

01:33.006 --> 01:35.528
- Yeah he could be your pudding, honey.
- That's right.

01:35.968 --> 01:39.282
You know what though? A girl can
dream, but pump the brakes.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.268
Team Michelle all day, all
day, all day everyday.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.309
I'm with you, I'm with you.

01:45.311 --> 01:47.740
But I'm gonna put this on
the record, ladies, okay?

01:47.741 --> 01:49.492
If he puts me on Air Force One,

01:49.493 --> 01:52.695
I'm gonna have to slip on my Air
Force Ones to get a good grip to

01:52.696 --> 01:55.081
handle all that, uh, turbulence.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.597
WOMAN2: That's gonna take you nowhere.

01:56.599 --> 01:58.673
I hope the first lady whoops your ass.

01:58.675 --> 01:59.785
I hope she whoops your ass.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.037
[Laughs]

02:02.038 --> 02:05.625
This A minus on President
Obama's report card is more

02:05.626 --> 02:06.626
than justified.

02:06.627 --> 02:11.546
2014 was by far the best year for
job creation in this century.

02:11.547 --> 02:15.968
See stalkers are officially now a hazard of
the business. And I know we have all had one.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.971
The last one I had, girl, he
would pretend like he was

02:18.972 --> 02:20.890
my assistant and pick up my cleaning.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.475
But all he wanted to do was pee

02:22.476 --> 02:24.977
on my underwear and leave
them at my front door.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.062
Eww.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.284
- He was white though, huh?
- Yep.

02:27.286 --> 02:30.816
Otherwise they would not have let
his ass pick up your dry cleaning.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.901
Yeah, brothas can't get a break.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.745
Topping off the night, Boko
Haram has struck again.

02:35.747 --> 02:37.156
This lime launching a rocket

02:37.157 --> 02:39.492
attack on the Nigerian town of Boga.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.810
This news is coming on the heels

02:40.811 --> 02:43.155
of the Nigerian military's claim

02:43.157 --> 02:45.430
that they had just
recaptured the small town.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.615
No, no no absolutely not.

02:47.617 --> 02:51.976
I am not gonna give some
broke ass dude a pre-nup

02:52.305 --> 02:53.673
in order to just be married.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.554
- That's crazy.
- But why not?

02:55.556 --> 02:57.531
I mean instead of dodging pre-nups,

02:57.533 --> 02:59.061
perhaps we successful sistas

02:59.062 --> 03:00.796
need to be handing them out.

03:00.797 --> 03:02.932
We just need to re-think this.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.151
Are we really talking
about legislating love?

03:05.152 --> 03:07.019
Yes.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.773
Because the institution of marriage
is in constant flux, baby.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.576
We have to redefine it,
that's all I'm saying.

03:13.577 --> 03:15.995
I'm coming around to what she is saying.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.531
- That's because you're drunk.
- No I'm not.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.070
- I've been drinking that water.
- [Laughs]

03:21.072 --> 03:22.913
It's the courage water, leave her alone.

03:22.915 --> 03:26.672
Courage water, yeah you've been drinking
too much of that courage water, girl.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.124
And who you looking around for?

03:28.125 --> 03:29.341
Uh huh, uh huh.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.793
Uhh.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.295
- I'm looking, hall monitor.
- [Laughs]

03:33.296 --> 03:36.692
Okay, Robin, I'm sorry, you were about to
say something crazy. Go ahead, baby girl.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.300
Seriously though, Mary Jane,

03:38.301 --> 03:39.802
even you said that you and your

03:39.803 --> 03:42.555
cuddy buddy have a great relationship.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.273
- Very open and honest.
- Yes.

03:44.274 --> 03:46.225
Some of your best communication.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.227
Um, that's because she doesn't want him.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.814
It's easy to be open, and
loving, and fun when all you

03:51.815 --> 03:53.315
want is that itch scratched.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.735
- ROBIN: Oh.
- True, true, true.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.571
Turn the tables and the microphone.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.438
[Laughs]

04:00.439 --> 04:03.793
I've never been fond of the
term "America eats its young,"

04:03.794 --> 04:09.331
but when the house proposes
cutting 759 billion over 8 years

04:09.332 --> 04:11.584
that will affect education, job

04:11.585 --> 04:13.385
training, and public safety, not

04:13.386 --> 04:14.887
to mention freeze the maximum

04:14.888 --> 04:16.805
Pell grant for the next decade.

04:16.807 --> 04:18.339
Well I hate to say it but

04:18.341 --> 04:20.841
gobble, gobble.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.896
I like this place. You're gonna
have to help me get a membership.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.765
Oh no problem. It's sexy, right?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.900
Well it's a little ol' melanin for me.

04:27.901 --> 04:28.901
But hey speak for yourself.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.903
- I was.
- Bye.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.238
Bye.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.774
No, no, you should not
be paying for that.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.942
- What are you doing?
- I didn't even know to ask.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.077
See I had my agent negotiate it

04:38.078 --> 04:40.362
in my contract and they
don't cover it all.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.782
- But now I get an allowance.
- Uh-uh,

04:42.783 --> 04:46.001
you want this black girl to look good on your
air, you're gonna have to pay for her hair

04:46.002 --> 04:50.089
to be sewn in, curled up, and
smoothed down on the edges.

04:50.090 --> 04:53.092
I mean they choke every corner
off that $5,000 invoice.

04:53.093 --> 04:56.011
You're talking about edges,
girl, it's time to go, come on.

04:56.012 --> 04:59.265
- They're real.
- That's exactly why I'm self employed.

04:59.266 --> 05:02.268
Bye, y'all. Call me tomorrow.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.053
Bye, girl.

05:04.054 --> 05:07.106
It's never a good time when you
start talking about your edges.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.275
You know what, right. I'm
glad she's driving her home.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.643

05:18.985 --> 05:22.655

05:22.656 --> 05:25.124
Great brand, I'm telling you,
you've got to be there, okay?

05:25.125 --> 05:29.411
Yes. You know I, um, I forgot my coat.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.663
You didn't come with a coat.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.832
No I did... well I, I
mean I, I, I had it and

05:32.833 --> 05:35.134
then I left it in there,
and now I gotta go back.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.386
- I'll come back in with you.
- No, no, no, you stay.

05:37.387 --> 05:39.755
Um, my Uber is five minutes away.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.724
- I'm okay.
- Okay and text me and let me

05:41.725 --> 05:42.892
know you made it in safe.

05:42.893 --> 05:45.311
- Text me.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.138

being mixed is seasonless

to feed him, but not too
late where you're yawning.

09:27.367 --> 09:31.452
- Nobody wants to waste their gas on a lazy lay.
- Right.

09:31.453 --> 09:38.362
- It's rude.
- Thanks. - Invoice.

09:41.563 --> 09:44.349
Though no one in the community recalls
seeing the dog before, the popular pup's

09:44.350 --> 09:45.484
getting a lot of love now after

09:45.485 --> 09:47.603
saving a young boy from drowning.

09:47.604 --> 09:50.171
He even received an honorary
medal for his courage.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.441
And while the local shelter has
not yet said whether the animal

09:52.442 --> 09:54.359
will be put up for adoption,

09:54.360 --> 09:58.080
there's already a FaceBook account
set up for interested families.

09:58.081 --> 09:59.281
The dog worked its way into many

09:59.282 --> 10:01.049
American hearts after we first

10:01.050 --> 10:03.368
reported the story of
this unlikely hero.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.620
Something tells me that with

10:04.621 --> 10:06.338
credits like that, he won't have

10:06.339 --> 10:08.290
any trouble finding a loving home now.

I think, I think the show's going fine.
It's fine.

10:49.799 --> 10:52.417
Right, what about your voice?

10:52.418 --> 10:55.137

- No, Kara, you look.

I'm enjoying the fact that you

11:12.355 --> 11:15.691

11:19.612 --> 11:21.413
- Mm-hmm.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.615
to have a clothing
allowance, that was fine.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.752

SNC's paying for a stylist.

19:46.736 --> 19:48.370
it isn't proof of citizenship.

19:48.371 --> 19:51.322
What we're really talking about
here, what we must honestly

19:51.323 --> 19:54.409
assess, is how much good this
really does for anybody.

19:54.410 --> 19:57.328
I mean other than government.
Government is really good at

19:57.329 --> 19:59.080
collecting fees for processing

19:59.081 --> 20:01.299
for renewals, for insurance, but

20:01.300 --> 20:04.052
that gets us away from the
more important issues.

20:04.053 --> 20:05.754
Can we talk about redistricting?

20:05.755 --> 20:08.339

you have the proper I.D.

20:08.340 --> 20:11.259

targeting lower income and

20:11.260 --> 20:13.144
middle income voters?

20:13.145 --> 20:14.229
Can we talk about North

20:14.230 --> 20:15.397
Carolina, where they've cut the

20:15.398 --> 20:18.149
number of early voting
days from 17 down to 10.

20:18.150 --> 20:21.653
You can't tell me that these
laws have anything to do with

20:21.654 --> 20:23.822
voter fraud.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.323
I want to get back to what

20:25.324 --> 20:29.818
Antonio was saying, because
flaws and all, the G.O.P.

20:29.820 --> 20:34.185
has not given up trying to, to win over
part of the Hispanic contingency, right?

20:34.187 --> 20:35.950
Right, right, no not, not at all.

20:35.951 --> 20:38.837
Former Puerto Rican governor
Luis G. Fortuna is a member of the

20:38.838 --> 20:39.921
Republican National committee.

20:39.922 --> 20:41.256
And he's been leading the charge

20:41.257 --> 20:44.926
and steering the conversation
away from immigration reform.

20:44.927 --> 20:48.847
Instead he encourages his
candidates to focus on job

20:48.848 --> 20:50.799
creation and smaller government.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.018
Issues that are important to
Hispanic American voters.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.387
Trading one distraction for another.

20:56.388 --> 20:57.388
Well yeah, maybe yes.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.773
It will take some time for the

20:58.774 --> 21:01.309
Latino voters to harness the
power of their numbers.

21:01.310 --> 21:03.311
But nevertheless there is power there.

21:03.312 --> 21:05.947
Just so we're clear, this is
just like the black vote.

21:05.948 --> 21:07.982
It will be a political football
at first, before it has any

21:07.983 --> 21:10.368
modicum of political power.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.871
Now that's just the fact of the matter.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.205
You present the false choice

21:14.206 --> 21:17.208
between either having them
fight for you, or ignore you

21:17.209 --> 21:21.212
altogether, and there is no power
in either of those things.

30:36.718 --> 30:37.835
Oh okay.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.553
Well for the record, I have not

30:39.554 --> 30:42.390
had sex with a white boy yet, I
just, I just let him feel me up.

30:42.391 --> 30:43.808
And why not?

30:43.809 --> 30:45.810
Because I just had sex
with Cuddy this week.

30:45.811 --> 30:48.145
And if I let the other guy do
more than feel me up, I'm a hoe.

30:48.146 --> 30:50.431
Absolutely not, you're
grown is what you are.

30:50.432 --> 30:51.515
Do what you wanna do.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.734
Okay so what's, what's
the hoe threshold?

30:53.735 --> 30:57.154
How much sex and blow jobs and,
and feel me ups am I allowed

30:57.155 --> 30:58.856
before I'm officially a hoe?

30:58.857 --> 31:01.609
See that's the thing, all of
our math is different, so that

31:01.610 --> 31:03.911
- makes our judgments different.
- Oh geez.

31:03.912 --> 31:07.031
Okay so, um, you're queen for the day.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.916
Make an international hoe off.

31:08.917 --> 31:11.502
Okay well all right, well if
your partner count is in the

31:11.503 --> 31:15.673
single digits, then you're
practically a virgin.

31:15.674 --> 31:16.924
Okay so I'm not a virgin.

31:16.925 --> 31:18.876
- Continue.
- [Laughs]

31:18.877 --> 31:20.928
All right, all right
well, um, let's see.

31:20.929 --> 31:25.683
Um, how about, um, three
sucks equals one smash.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.718
- Okay, okay.
- I'm just saying.

31:27.719 --> 31:32.473
So if a woman gives head to,
to 12 guys, she's no more hoe

31:32.474 --> 31:34.809
than the woman who sleeps
with 4 different men?

31:34.810 --> 31:36.977
Okay damn you and the
math, but more or less.

31:36.978 --> 31:39.780
Eww, I'm a little bit more
judicious about who I give the

31:39.781 --> 31:41.198
whole enchilada to but I have,

31:41.199 --> 31:43.451
child, given my fair show of blow jobs.

31:43.452 --> 31:45.953
- I like them. - Mmm.
- Kill me, I like them.

31:45.954 --> 31:47.955
No it's all right, just
don't drink off my glass.

31:47.956 --> 31:49.073
I'm just saying.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.876
But you know, live it,
be proud about it.

31:51.877 --> 31:54.078
I am, that's why I told you.
I'm not gonna InstaGram it.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.963
No but you got to live that thing.

31:55.964 --> 31:58.632
I mean if it's something that
you love to do, and you're

31:58.633 --> 32:00.718
obviously good at it, then you

32:00.719 --> 32:04.505
just, I mean you're not
married, so why not?

32:04.506 --> 32:05.639
You know what I'm saying?

32:05.640 --> 32:07.892
- Yeah.
- And hell, the longer we stay

32:07.893 --> 32:09.643
single, and we keep having sex,

32:09.644 --> 32:12.179
somebody is gonna call us a hoe anyway.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.681
And I do like sex.

32:13.682 --> 32:15.649
Yes, child, yes, child.

32:15.650 --> 32:17.818
- Yes, yes.
- Two snaps for sex.

32:17.819 --> 32:19.904
I love sex too and that's
why you got me over here.

32:19.905 --> 32:23.524
Cause I can validate your
wretched, your wretchedness,

32:23.525 --> 32:24.525
your wretched.

MARY JANE: Guilty.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.778
- Get myself on that team.
- Guilty.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.863
But you know what?

32:28.864 --> 32:31.999
Being single is so tricky,
you know what I mean?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.667
You, you go for it.

32:33.668 --> 32:35.085
Oh I've gone for it.

32:35.086 --> 32:37.671
You go on a date, you like them.

32:37.672 --> 32:39.957
You, you, you, you finally after

32:39.958 --> 32:41.509
debating with yourself how long

32:41.510 --> 32:44.178
you should wait, you have sex with him.

32:44.179 --> 32:46.263
And then it's eh.

32:46.264 --> 32:49.717
Or you're like me and you
freakin' used to skip over the,

32:49.718 --> 32:51.018
the whole over-thinking

32:51.019 --> 32:53.687
thing, and you go straight
to the sex with him.

32:53.688 --> 32:55.272
And he blows your freakin' mind,

32:55.273 --> 32:57.858
and you're like oh my
God, this is a sign.

32:57.859 --> 32:59.276
You try to turn it into love.

32:59.277 --> 33:00.694
And then he starts treating you

33:00.695 --> 33:02.813
like eh, and then your
numbers begin to multiple.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.815
And you're like now I'm
onto the next one.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.867
Now how did I get to ten
guys in the last six months?

33:06.868 --> 33:08.819
It just gets away from you, doesn't it?

33:08.820 --> 33:10.654
- Yeah it gets away from you.
- It just gets away from you.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.040
Okay, okay, so, so okay I
just, I just had a thought.

33:13.041 --> 33:16.994
I think you should be able to
reset your hoe button if you

33:16.995 --> 33:19.246
make it to 35 and you've
never been married.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.915
Ooh I like where you're going

33:20.916 --> 33:23.717
with that, cause it kinda, it
kinda evens the playing field.

33:23.718 --> 33:24.802
Yes.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.971
Cause I know way too many
hoes that get to reset their hoe

33:26.972 --> 33:29.640
button when somebody
publicly claims their butt.

33:29.641 --> 33:32.810
Uh-huh, and then they pop out
a baby, and cue the angels.

33:32.811 --> 33:34.228

vagina have been doing.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.684
You tried to turn that thing inside out.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.653
I know, you's a hoe.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.738
You's a hoe.

33:44.739 --> 33:46.824
You a hoe with a baby
shower, you're still a hoe.

33:46.825 --> 33:47.942
What are you talking about?

33:47.943 --> 33:49.076
Are you kidding me?

33:49.077 --> 33:50.778
But now can you wear white?

33:50.779 --> 33:51.779
[Laughs]

33:51.780 --> 33:52.913
You can't wear white.

33:52.914 --> 33:55.332
Okay, queen of international hoe-I am.

33:55.333 --> 33:58.836
If you got a reset, would
you still be a hoe?

toes, your fingers, your toes
