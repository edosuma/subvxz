00:59.794 --> 01:03.495
One socket wrench coming up!

01:03.497 --> 01:05.297
Perfect.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.803
That takes care of the engine.
Thanks, Rocky.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.471
Sure thing, Ryder.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.305
(Whistling)

01:13.307 --> 01:16.275
I'm sure to win this year's
Mayors Race,

since I'm making sure all the
other mayors lose.

Oh, my!

01:24.618 --> 01:26.885

racing boat?

01:26.887 --> 01:32.257
Hmm... Catastrophe Crew,
you know the drill.

not your year... again!

01:45.673 --> 01:47.639
(Laughing)

01:47.641 --> 01:49.975
The Mayors Race is hard work.

01:49.977 --> 01:53.612
I have to swim, run, and...

01:53.614 --> 01:55.514
row a boat.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.282
I really need to practice.

01:57.284 --> 02:00.419
Water! Sinking!

02:00.421 --> 02:01.320
Help!

02:01.322 --> 02:03.489
It's pretty bleak
when your boat gets a leak.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.625
Don't worry, Mayor,
I'll help you!

02:16.303 --> 02:18.504
Ooh!

02:24.745 --> 02:26.945
If my rowboat's
not in ship-shape,

02:26.947 --> 02:28.280
I'll never win the Mayors Race.

02:28.282 --> 02:31.783
Call Ryder!
He'll know what to do.

02:31.785 --> 02:35.988
I know! I'll call Ryder!
He'll know what to do.

Mayor Goodway's been

MAYOR:
<i> What am I going to do?</i>
<i> What am I going to do?!</i>

Chase, I need you to use your
megaphone and cones

03:52.499 --> 03:55.867
to help train Mayor Goodway for
the running part of the race.

03:55.869 --> 03:59.104
Coach Chase is on the case!

03:59.406 --> 04:04.009

arm to fix Mayor Goodway's boat.

best chance to win.

Looks like it was
made on purpose.

06:22.683 --> 06:26.852
Chase, can you sniff out
who did this?

06:26.854 --> 06:27.619
Achoo!

06:27.621 --> 06:32.491
It's hard to be sure.
My allergies are-- achoo!

But... I'm in the middle
of a race. Excuse me.

08:14.728 --> 08:18.363
Swimming through. No time
to play with dolphins.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.335
And the winner...

08:23.337 --> 08:25.303
is me!

08:25.305 --> 08:26.771
Achoo!

08:26.773 --> 08:28.707
Hmm...

08:28.709 --> 08:30.976
Over there!

08:30.978 --> 08:32.978
Looks like your allergies
were right.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.779
It's the Catastrophe Crew.

08:34.781 --> 08:38.216
Skye, Humdinger and
the kittens are cheating.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.718
We need your eyes in the sky.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.252
<i> On it!</i>

08:40.254 --> 08:43.054
Chase, make sure they
don't disrupt the race.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.790
Chase is-- achoo-- on the case.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.663
Oh, if I just keep this up,
I'll win the run at least.

Phew!

08:53.767 --> 08:56.201
(Snickering)

09:00.908 --> 09:03.141
Achoo!

09:03.143 --> 09:04.743
Huh?

09:04.745 --> 09:08.880
The Catastrophe Crew,
with a barrel of corn oil?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.148
(Barking)

09:10.150 --> 09:12.384
Net!

09:12.386 --> 09:14.286
Achoo!

09:18.158 --> 09:19.758
(Meowing)

09:20.060 --> 09:23.828
You won't be pouring slippery
oil on the course today.

09:23.830 --> 09:27.799
Remember to take long strides,
Mayor Goodway.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.068
Yes... strides... oh, yes.

09:32.339 --> 09:36.408
Running is not my style,
but this is!

09:42.449 --> 09:45.183
(Snickering)

09:50.757 --> 09:53.058
I have him in my sights, Ryder.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.828
He's riding the Kitty-mobile
and taking a shortcut.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.463
RYDER:
Good work, Skye!

09:59.232 --> 09:59.898
Ha-ha-ha!

09:59.900 --> 10:04.102
Looks like I'm the
fastest mayor of them all!

10:04.104 --> 10:07.339
Whoa! Log!

10:09.843 --> 10:12.744
Oh, no! Ryder,
Mayor Humdinger needs help!

10:12.746 --> 10:17.782
We're on our way.
Chase, come on!

10:19.886 --> 10:23.154
Now I'll never win!

10:24.291 --> 10:25.957
Hold tight, Mayor Humdinger.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.258
The PAW Patrol is here.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.761
Chase, I need
your winch line.

10:29.763 --> 10:30.762
Ruff! Winch!

10:34.134 --> 10:37.736
Grab on and we'll
bring you up safely.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.873
Get me off this cliff!

10:41.875 --> 10:46.911
Ruff! Winch line, retract!

10:46.913 --> 10:49.314
But what if I fall?

10:51.284 --> 10:52.951
That was a close call.

10:52.953 --> 10:53.518
Yes, well...

10:53.520 --> 10:56.454
I suppose I must thank you and
the pups for rescuing me.

10:56.456 --> 11:00.158
Don't mention it. Just remember,
cheaters never win.

11:00.160 --> 11:00.959
Now, come on, pups,

11:00.961 --> 11:04.863
let's go see Mayor Goodway
cross the finish line.

11:08.935 --> 11:11.936
(Cheering)

11:16.176 --> 11:16.975
Drat it all!

11:16.977 --> 11:19.778
I did it! I finished
the Mayors Race!

11:19.780 --> 11:23.014
And with Mayor Humdinger
disqualified,

11:23.016 --> 11:24.949
you won the Mayors Race!

11:24.951 --> 11:27.986
Did you hear that, Chickaletta?

11:27.988 --> 11:31.790
Don't you want to
congratulate your mommy?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.558
Bawk!

11:33.560 --> 11:36.027
Yes... well...

11:36.029 --> 11:37.128
Oh, thanks, Ryder,

11:37.130 --> 11:40.265
and thanks PAW Patrol
for all your help.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.068
What good pups you are!

11:43.070 --> 11:44.402
Bawk!

11:44.404 --> 11:45.904
(Laughing)

11:54.848 --> 11:56.815
Your turn, Rubble.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.021
Horseshoes? I wanna play!

12:03.023 --> 12:05.557
Whoa!

12:06.259 --> 12:07.459
Did I win?

12:07.461 --> 12:09.260
(Laughing)

12:10.263 --> 12:10.929
Oh, thank you

12:10.931 --> 12:13.898
for helping sort through
Wild Wilbur's old cabin, Ryder.

12:13.900 --> 12:18.103
I'd come in,
but there might be... bugs.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.004
And Chickaletta
does not like bugs.

12:20.874 --> 12:25.477
You're welcome, Mayor.
This old hideout is awesome!

12:25.479 --> 12:27.545
There must be some
great stuff here.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.948
Wild Wilbur hid all of his
outlawed loot

12:29.950 --> 12:30.882
somewhere in these mountains.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.552
I would love to display it all
in City Hall.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.522
Sorry, Mayor Goodway.
When I find Wild Wilbur's loot

12:37.524 --> 12:39.924
I'll put it on display at
the Foggy Bottom Museum!

12:39.926 --> 12:43.495
Foggy Bottom doesn't
even have a museum.

12:43.497 --> 12:47.365
I'm starting one...
in my house.

12:47.968 --> 12:51.102
This looks like an old map.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.605
BOTH:
A map?!

12:54.908 --> 12:56.941
It could be a map to
Wild Wilbur's hidden loot.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.078
A trail leads to a cave
in the mountains.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.281
Those dollar signs must be where
Wild Wilbur hid his loot!

13:03.283 --> 13:08.386
That map is so pretty I must...
take a picture.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.022
First one to the loot wins it!

13:11.024 --> 13:14.659
Finders keepers,
losers weepers! Ha-ha-ha!

13:14.661 --> 13:15.627
Oh, cabin beetles!

13:15.629 --> 13:19.464
If Humdinger finds the loot,
he'll keep it for himself!

13:19.466 --> 13:20.365
Don't worry, Mayor Goodway.

13:20.367 --> 13:24.636
I know who can help us find the
loot before Mayor Humdinger.

13:24.638 --> 13:28.506
No job is too big,
no pup is too small!

13:30.477 --> 13:32.977
PAW Patrol, to the lookout!

13:32.979 --> 13:34.045
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

13:34.047 --> 13:36.915
(Barking)

13:41.321 --> 13:43.021
Whoa, whoa! Oof!

13:44.090 --> 13:46.958
Look, got a ringer!

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
(Laughing)

14:04.377 --> 14:08.413
PAW Patrol ready for action,
Ryder, sir!

14:08.415 --> 14:11.082
Pups, we found an old map
belonging to Wild Wilbur

14:11.084 --> 14:14.452
that shows where
he hid his loot.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.720
(Excited barking)

14:15.722 --> 14:19.357
The problem is, Mayor Humdinger
has a copy of the map,

14:19.359 --> 14:20.458
and a head start.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.261
He wants to keep
the loot for himself!

14:23.263 --> 14:27.632
Chase, I'll need you to use your
drone to track Mayor Humdinger.

14:27.634 --> 14:31.035
Spy Chase is on the case.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.204
Rubble, I'll need you
and your shovel

14:33.206 --> 14:34.973
to dig up the hidden loot.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.107
Let's dig it!

14:36.109 --> 14:39.677
All right, PAW Patrol
is on a roll!

14:39.679 --> 14:41.379
(Barking)

14:43.717 --> 14:45.416
¶ PAW Patrol ¶

14:45.418 --> 14:47.685

14:50.724 --> 14:52.991

15:14.314 --> 15:16.047

15:31.064 --> 15:43.541
¶

15:48.448 --> 15:50.281
We can't drive
any further, pups.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.050
We'll have to hike from here.

15:52.052 --> 15:55.420
Chase, send your drone ahead to
search for Mayor Humdinger.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.423
Ruff! Deploy drone!

15:58.425 --> 15:59.057
Launch!

15:59.059 --> 16:03.094
Find Mayor Humdinger.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.264
Which way should we go, Ryder?

16:06.266 --> 16:09.233
Let's check the map.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.103
First clue:
elephant plus tree.

16:12.105 --> 16:16.374
But there aren't any elephants
in the mountains.

16:16.376 --> 16:20.511
Maybe he meant something
like an elephant.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.681
Elephant tree!

16:23.683 --> 16:24.515
(Howling)

16:24.517 --> 16:28.653
According to the map, we go
around the elephant tree.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.121
Come on!

16:30.123 --> 16:34.659
Wow! An elephant with
two trunks! Ha-ha!

16:36.563 --> 16:38.296
Your drone found
the mayor, Chase,

16:38.298 --> 16:41.299
crossing a log over a river.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.835
There he is! Come on!

16:44.504 --> 16:48.673
What? Not this time,
PAW Patrol.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.212
Good luck trying to cross now!
Ha-ha-ha!

16:54.214 --> 16:56.280
Chase, use your zip line.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.316
Got it!

16:58.318 --> 17:00.284
Ruff! Zip line!

17:05.258 --> 17:07.225
Yahoo!
Okay, Chase!

17:15.502 --> 17:18.236
Great job, Chase!

17:19.172 --> 17:21.873
Ryder, which way now?

17:21.875 --> 17:25.276
The map says turn left
at the snowman.

17:25.278 --> 17:25.810
A snowman?

17:25.812 --> 17:28.146
He must've hidden
his loot in the winter.

17:28.148 --> 17:33.251
Or maybe he meant turn at...
snowman rock!

17:33.253 --> 17:34.652
(Howling)

17:34.654 --> 17:35.486
Good eye, Rubble!

17:35.488 --> 17:39.724
Hmm... it needs something.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.526
I know!

17:44.330 --> 17:47.231
Now it looks like a snowman.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.734
(Laughing)

17:52.605 --> 17:54.806
Mayor Humdinger is still ahead.

17:54.808 --> 17:55.506
We have to hurry.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.908
I see him!

17:56.910 --> 18:01.879
Uh-oh, that old rope bridge
doesn't look safe.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.282
Buzz off, would you?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.521
Oh... whoa...

18:12.892 --> 18:13.925
(Yelling)

18:13.927 --> 18:14.459
Whoa!

18:14.461 --> 18:16.260
Pups, we've gotta
help the mayor.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.729
But my net won't go that far.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.332
We need a pup who
can get here fast.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.334
A mountain pup!

18:23.336 --> 18:27.538
Everest, Ryder here. I need you
and your grappling hook

18:27.540 --> 18:29.774
at the old canyon
rope bridge fast.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.276
Mayor Humdinger
is stuck on the bridge!

18:32.278 --> 18:32.944
On my way, Ryder!

18:32.946 --> 18:35.813
Off the trail,
Everest won't fail!

18:35.815 --> 18:38.349
¶ Everest! ¶

18:38.885 --> 18:40.952
¶ Go, go, go, go! ¶

18:40.954 --> 18:42.987
¶ Go, go, go! ¶

18:42.989 --> 18:46.724
¶ PAW Patrol, PAW Patrol ¶

18:49.229 --> 18:52.697
Help!

18:52.699 --> 18:53.564
I'm here, Ryder.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.634
Everest, shoot your grappling
hook over the tree branch

18:56.636 --> 18:57.535
and land it near the mayor.

18:57.537 --> 19:01.272
You bet! Ruff ruff!
Grappling hook!

19:07.914 --> 19:08.946
Oh...

19:08.948 --> 19:09.680
Perfect, Everest!

19:09.682 --> 19:13.918
Now, grab onto the line and
swing to the edge of the canyon.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.887
But what if I fall?

19:15.889 --> 19:18.990
It's okay, you won't!

19:18.992 --> 19:21.893
Whoa!

19:21.895 --> 19:22.527
Chase, net!

19:22.529 --> 19:26.564
Ruff! Net!

19:26.566 --> 19:28.399
Whoa!

19:28.401 --> 19:29.333
Yes!

19:29.335 --> 19:32.403
We did it!

19:33.039 --> 19:33.704
Good work, pups!

19:33.706 --> 19:37.308
Thanks, Ryder.
I appreciate the rescue.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.009
Don't worry, Mayor.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.045
If you're ever in trouble,
just yelp for help.

19:41.047 --> 19:44.315
Well, see ya later!
I'm off to find the loot!

19:44.317 --> 19:46.951
But-- but-- we just saved him!

19:46.953 --> 19:49.020
We better find a way across too!

19:49.022 --> 19:53.925
Don't worry, pups. I know this
canyon like the back of my paw.

19:53.927 --> 19:56.027
(Howling)

19:56.029 --> 19:58.496
I never knew about
this shortcut.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.964
What's next, Ryder?

19:59.966 --> 20:00.731
Let's check the map.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.466
All that's left is the big X.

20:02.468 --> 20:08.673
We should be coming up to it
right about... now.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.340
ALL:
The X!

20:09.342 --> 20:11.375
The cave should be here
someplace.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.511
There it is!

20:13.513 --> 20:15.713
Good work, pups!

20:15.715 --> 20:17.915
Ruff! Light!

20:17.917 --> 20:19.417
I sure hope we beat
Mayor Humdinger!

20:19.419 --> 20:23.621
Okay, pups,
let's see what's inside.

20:23.623 --> 20:24.956
(Bats squeaking)

20:24.958 --> 20:26.691
Whoa!

20:27.594 --> 20:28.826
(Laughing)

20:28.828 --> 20:29.527
Just some bats.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.729
Yeah, no big deal.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.496
Here's another X.

20:32.498 --> 20:35.900
Rubble, see what's under there.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.401
Arf! Shovel!

20:44.544 --> 20:47.078
Found something, Ryder!

20:47.880 --> 20:50.114
Cool!
Whoa!

20:50.116 --> 20:52.383
Wait, there something else
down here too.

20:52.385 --> 20:55.653
What is it, Rubble?

20:55.655 --> 20:57.521
Wild Wilbur's loot!

20:57.523 --> 21:00.558
Hey! We found that!

21:00.560 --> 21:02.460
And I found it sitting here.

21:02.462 --> 21:05.963
Finders keepers,
losers weepers.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.669
And it's all mine!

21:11.671 --> 21:12.637
Oh!

21:12.639 --> 21:13.604
What?

21:13.606 --> 21:14.505
Long johns?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.540
This isn't valuable loot.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.075
I don't know, Mayor.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.878
I bet in the old days,
in the freezing cold,

21:20.880 --> 21:23.848
long underwear was the best
thing you could have.

21:23.850 --> 21:24.548
(Laughing)

21:24.550 --> 21:27.518
Argh... Mayor Goodway can have
her outlaw's loot.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.620
I don't want it!

21:29.622 --> 21:32.790
She can be Mayor Long Johns,
not me.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.893
Come on, let's go see
what else is in the hole.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.896
Maybe it's hats
to match the underwear.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.931
(Laughing)

21:44.537 --> 21:46.771
ALL:
Whoa!

21:46.773 --> 21:49.674
Real old-time outlaw loot?

21:49.676 --> 21:52.910
(Howling)

21:53.980 --> 21:57.014
Oh, great job, PAW Patrol.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.482
Old coins!

21:58.484 --> 22:01.986
Oh, and look at these wonderful
old long johns!

22:01.988 --> 22:04.989
I can't wait to put this
in the museum.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.692
Real gold and silver coins?

22:07.694 --> 22:12.129
That's right, Mayor Humdinger,
and like you always say,

22:12.131 --> 22:13.864
finders keepers...

22:13.866 --> 22:17.535
And losers... weepers!

22:17.537 --> 22:21.539
(Sobbing)

22:22.475 --> 22:24.775
(Howling)

22:24.777 --> 22:28.579
Oh, they're so adorable
in those long johns.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.947
(Howling)

22:29.949 --> 22:31.449
Whoa!

22:33.486 --> 22:35.886
(Evil snickering)

22:37.623 --> 22:40.691
Aww...

22:42.562 --> 22:46.163
What a good chicken,
and what good pups!

22:46.165 --> 22:47.465
