WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:07.041
WADE: That's why you stopped
 our little frolic

00:07.075 --> 00:08.376
the other night?
 You got googly eyes

00:08.409 --> 00:09.510
for golden boy George?

00:09.543 --> 00:10.678
Do you really
think that about me?

00:10.711 --> 00:12.513
That I'm snobbish
and shallow?

00:12.546 --> 00:13.381
Zoe knows about us.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.615
George, Lavon and I

00:14.648 --> 00:16.650
had an affair;
I cannot tell you

00:16.684 --> 00:18.486
how sorry I am.
You don't have to.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.553
'Cause it's over.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.455
Yes, I swear to you it...
Lemon.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.523
I meant us.

00:22.556 --> 00:23.791
No.
 I didn't want to be

00:23.824 --> 00:25.126
in the middle of all of this.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.394
I understand, yeah.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.428
Except one thing,

00:27.461 --> 00:28.862
we're not friends.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.868
(shower starts)

00:48.416 --> 00:50.784
Who the...

00:58.659 --> 01:01.129
Uh-oh.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.964
(sighs)
George knows.

01:03.997 --> 01:06.667
Months of keeping
the big secret,

01:06.700 --> 01:08.869
and now, ka-bam,
it's exploded.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.838
Who knows what the
fallout's gonna be?

01:10.871 --> 01:12.606
All the belles
could be wearing black.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.275
Yeah, well, all I know
is I blew it.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.710
Kissing Lemon in public.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.412
Monumentally stupid.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.580
And George Tucker...

01:19.613 --> 01:22.015
Poor George.
Yeah.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.317
(grunts)

01:25.453 --> 01:26.554
What are you doing?

01:26.587 --> 01:27.588
George is hurt and angry.

01:27.621 --> 01:28.956
He already lashed out at me.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.458
It's obvious that you
will be the next target.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.427
I just want you to be prepared.

01:33.461 --> 01:34.562
(grunts)

01:34.595 --> 01:36.330
Okay, you know I got hit

01:36.364 --> 01:38.999
by 350-pound linemen
for a living, right?

01:39.032 --> 01:39.833
Mm-hmm.

01:39.867 --> 01:40.968
Those little jabs are just

01:41.001 --> 01:43.404
like butterflies dancing
on my chest.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.872
And no offense to George,

01:44.905 --> 01:46.940
not exactly afraid
of his right hook, either.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.008
Though he's got

01:48.041 --> 01:49.343
a right to try.
I'm gonna go

01:49.377 --> 01:51.078
to the Rammer Jammer
and do some recon.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.481
Find out what everyone's
saying about the big breakup.

01:53.514 --> 01:56.417
You should probably lay
low until I report back.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.754
Hey, uh,
I need y'all's help.

02:00.788 --> 02:01.822
Why would I help you?

02:01.855 --> 02:03.191
Why would I help anyone?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.858
I am a shallow
snob, remember?

02:04.892 --> 02:06.294
Move out of my way.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.429
Ow.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.431
Lavon...

02:10.464 --> 02:11.565
Wait, write it down.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.066
If you do your
laundry once a week,

02:13.100 --> 02:14.635
you won't have
to borrow my socks.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.270
Yeah, or your underwear.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.037
My what now?

02:17.070 --> 02:18.339
Look, it doesn't matter.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.873
Point is there's
an emergency, all right?

02:19.907 --> 02:22.009
Last night, regrettably,
I got very drunk,

02:22.042 --> 02:24.044
and, uh, I slept
with someone.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.480
So, that happens
all the time.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.748
Well, I can't remember who.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.016
And that happens
most of the time.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.452
Yeah, but none
of my other overnight guests

02:31.485 --> 02:32.653
wear things...

02:32.686 --> 02:35.489
(clears throat)
...like this.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.891
That is a large garment.

02:37.925 --> 02:40.060
She's in my shower right now.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.530
Are you sure she could
fit in your shower?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.298
What are we gonna do?

02:44.332 --> 02:47.801
You are gonna head back home
and meet your new girlfriend.

02:47.835 --> 02:48.936
Bring her a doughnut.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.605
Come with me. Please.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.607
Go.

02:53.641 --> 02:54.942
You're a good friend.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.944
Thank you, thank you so much.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.111
You made your bed.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.713
Hope she didn't break it.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.849
MEN (a capella):
* Come, friends

03:01.882 --> 03:03.617
* Who plough the sea

03:03.651 --> 03:05.686
* Truce to navigation

03:05.719 --> 03:07.555
* Take another station

03:07.588 --> 03:10.824
* Let's vary piracy

03:10.858 --> 03:13.794
* With a little burglary

03:13.827 --> 03:16.063
Hey, Shelsters,

03:16.096 --> 03:17.565
wh-what's going on, huh?

03:17.598 --> 03:18.666
Any news? Any gossip?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.568
Debbie Jean Fordham
got laryngitis

03:20.601 --> 03:23.704
and can't perform
on Dash DeWitt's charity revue,

03:23.737 --> 03:25.773
"Gilbert and South-ivan"
tomorrow.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.808
Gilbert and South-ivan?

03:27.841 --> 03:30.378
And that's the gossip?
The only gossip?

03:30.411 --> 03:32.346
Sorry, geez.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.917
Hey, Brick.

03:38.752 --> 03:39.720
How you holding up?

03:39.753 --> 03:41.489
What do you think?

03:41.522 --> 03:43.357
I am so furious,
I can't even see straight.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.225
I'm sorry, I heard.
(sighs)

03:45.259 --> 03:47.227
Yeah, but after a while,
this anger will pass.
No, it won't,

03:47.261 --> 03:49.463
not before I have to get up
and sing tomorrow night.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.631
Sing?
Do you know

03:50.664 --> 03:51.999
how many words there are

03:52.032 --> 03:54.201
in "I Am a Very Model
of a Modern Major General"?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.270
There's ten
in the title alone.

03:56.304 --> 03:59.273
I can't believe I let Dash
convince me to sign up for this.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.409
Right.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.412
Dash, now he is
always causing trouble.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.153
I still don't understand.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.723
How is this cake gonna make
George un-break up with you?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.156
Oh, he didn't
break up with me.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.192
He was angry,
and he lashed out,

04:19.226 --> 04:20.728
but he didn't mean it.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.496
And how do you know?

04:22.530 --> 04:23.931
You see this?

04:23.964 --> 04:24.832
Mm-hmm.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.500
Zero calls, you know why?

04:26.534 --> 04:27.701
Because George

04:27.735 --> 04:28.836
has not told anyone.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.103
Not even a single soul.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.905
Had he even insinuated
that we were fighting,

04:31.939 --> 04:34.308
that phone would be
ringing off the hook

04:34.342 --> 04:36.043
with people wanting
in on the gossip.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.745
Maybe he hasn't had
a chance to tell anyone.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.746
It just happened.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.147
Maybe.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.750
But until then, I have hopes
that he will reconsider.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.652
So this morning,
I am bringing him

04:44.685 --> 04:47.154
his favorite cake,
and I'm going to apologize.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.589
What's he so angry about anyway?

04:48.622 --> 04:51.058
I never heard what you
guys were fighting about.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.460
It's not important.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.428
Because all today
and all tomorrow,

04:54.462 --> 04:56.997
during Dash's revue,
I'm going to apologize.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.532
And I will not stop,

04:58.566 --> 05:01.369
and eventually,
he will have to forgive me.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.910
Uh...

05:09.943 --> 05:11.178
Hello?

05:11.211 --> 05:12.546
TOM:
Hey, Wade.
(screams)

05:13.681 --> 05:14.782
(both screaming)

05:14.815 --> 05:16.717
Why are we screaming?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.686
What are you doing here?
Don't you remember?

05:18.719 --> 05:20.688
I wouldn't be asking, Tom,
if I remembered.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.923
I found you last night walking
on the side of the road.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.291
You were drunk as a skunk.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.360
So I brought you back here,
and I was tired,

05:26.394 --> 05:27.495
so I slept over.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.762
In my bed?

05:28.796 --> 05:29.963
The couch was itchy.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.832
Don't worry, we
slept feet to head.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.435
Eh, some things are best forgot.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.303
Tom, uh...

05:36.336 --> 05:39.640
can you tell me
whose shirt this is?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.709
Maybe what I was doing
by the side of the road?

05:41.742 --> 05:43.010
I have no idea.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.311
This is intriguing.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.381
And where's my car, Tom?
You lost your car?

05:47.415 --> 05:50.317
Oh, man, this is just
like The Hangover,

05:50.350 --> 05:52.920
which is awesome, because it's
exactly like The Hangover 2.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.489
There might be a tiger
in your closet.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.060
I'm going over there.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.128
He needs a friend.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.195
A friend?

06:02.229 --> 06:03.397
He's not even speaking to you.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.599
George just thinks
he's mad at me.

06:05.633 --> 06:06.800
He needs someone today.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.470
Someone who understands
what he's going through.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.971
You're not trying to use
this to your advantage?

06:11.004 --> 06:12.205
I am a doctor,

06:12.239 --> 06:14.475
which is why I am
bringing him this soup,

06:14.508 --> 06:16.009
homemade by me.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.446
Uh-huh?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.148
And what's this now?

06:21.181 --> 06:23.050
I had to use a can opener.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.818
That counts.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.655
Not in the South, it doesn't.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.836
I should have known.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.738
30 seconds
after George found out,

06:44.772 --> 06:46.306
you'd make your move.

06:46.339 --> 06:49.109
I didn't make my move,
I made soup.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.711
Listen to me,
little Miss Opportunistic,

06:50.744 --> 06:53.881
George may be angry at me,
but he will forgive me.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.517
In a couple of weeks, we will
be standing in that church,

06:56.550 --> 06:58.385
and we will be
saying our vows,

06:58.418 --> 07:01.221
and then we will be dancing
to "What a Wonderful World"

07:01.254 --> 07:03.557
in front of our 200
closest friends.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.426
And nothing and nobody
is gonna stop it.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.128
Lemon, I am simply
here because my friend,

07:08.161 --> 07:09.296
George, is in pain.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.998
He needs someone to talk to.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.266
Someone who didn't
break his heart.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.068
MAN:
Hey, George!

07:15.102 --> 07:17.304
*

07:30.317 --> 07:32.252
(fishing reel clicking)

07:38.692 --> 07:40.460
(cheering)

07:53.473 --> 07:55.042
Ladies, hi.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.845
Lemon, did you make
that cake for me?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.112
How thoughtful of you.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.249
And Zoe, is that...
is that soup?

08:03.016 --> 08:04.484
How sweet.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.119
Well,
you know what, ladies?

08:06.153 --> 08:07.655
I'll see you two later.

08:07.688 --> 08:08.856
Thanks for the grub.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.265
(cheerleaders chanting)

08:18.298 --> 08:20.834
(car horn honks)

08:20.868 --> 08:22.936
(seagulls calling)

08:22.970 --> 08:25.272
(birds singing)

08:33.013 --> 08:34.481
It was so weird.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.183
George Tucker was happy.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.684
Elated, even.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.886
It didn't even seem like
he was angry with me anymore.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.554
He is obviously in denial,

08:41.589 --> 08:43.523
which is stage one
in the five stages of grief.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.159
Yes, Zoe, even I,
the stupid football jock,

08:46.193 --> 08:47.561
knows what denial is.

08:47.595 --> 08:50.598
Sorry, I just...
I've never seen a case this bad.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.299
He needs to deal
with his feelings.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.935
I have to figure out a way
how to help him move on

08:54.968 --> 08:56.136
to stage two--

08:56.169 --> 08:57.571
anger-- before he snaps.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.640
And you're researching
how on a computer?

08:59.673 --> 09:01.975
Aren't you supposed
to be a doctor?

09:02.009 --> 09:03.510
Psych was not my best rotation.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.246
My thesis, "Get Over It,"
wasn't well received.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.314
Can't imagine why.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.649
The Internet is no help.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.251
It is telling me to let him be.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.053
It's unaware of the danger.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.355
Which is?
Which is he denies himself

09:15.388 --> 09:17.791
right down the aisle
with a woman who cheated on him.

09:17.825 --> 09:18.959
I see.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.160
Zoe?

09:20.193 --> 09:21.995
Maybe you should
just let this go.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.463
Oh, no, I cannot let this go.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.532
George's mental health
is in jeopardy.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.935
I have to get a consult.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.607
(piano playing)

09:33.641 --> 09:35.142
* I am the very model

09:35.175 --> 09:37.577
* Of a modern major general,
I've la-la-la-la *

09:37.611 --> 09:40.347
* Animal and la-la-la-la,
Benadryl *

09:40.380 --> 09:41.849
Benadryl, Brick?
You know, it's just hard

09:41.882 --> 09:44.818
for me to-to sing and...
with all these distractions.

09:44.852 --> 09:45.819
All right, all right.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.454
(piano resumes)

09:47.487 --> 09:50.023
* Know the kings of England and
a... (mumbles) *

09:50.057 --> 09:51.491
Tom?

09:51.524 --> 09:55.228
That boat is awesome.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.031
Will you pass the white paint?

09:58.065 --> 09:59.366
The white paint?

09:59.399 --> 10:01.201
Uh, uh...

10:01.234 --> 10:04.371
Sure, I'd... okay.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.106
(Brick continues)
Hey, Tom, buddy. Sweet tea?

10:06.139 --> 10:07.908
Yeah.
Wanda?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.209
Me?
Yeah.

10:09.242 --> 10:12.045
Brick, the performance
is tomorrow.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.014
You should have given me these
lyrics, like-like, a month ago.

10:14.047 --> 10:14.982
Well, I did.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.483
GEORGE:
Sweet tea, anyone?

10:16.516 --> 10:20.287
Hello, Lemon, would you like
some sweet tea?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.389
No, I-I do not want
a sweet tea.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.924
What the hell is going on?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.926
I believe that we are at
rehearsal for Dash's revue,

10:25.959 --> 10:28.228
and we are scheduled to sing
"I Am the Pirate King."

10:28.261 --> 10:30.998
Did something happen to you?
Are you okay?

10:31.031 --> 10:31.999
I'm fantastic.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.233
(Brick continues)
But you...

10:33.266 --> 10:35.335
you do remember
what happened last night?

10:35.368 --> 10:38.005
Oh, of course I remember.
Something like that's
hard to forget.

10:38.038 --> 10:41.374
All right, Brick. Come on,
next up is "Three Little
Maids from School."

10:41.408 --> 10:44.377
(piano playing lively intro)

10:44.411 --> 10:47.547
I am missing one little maid.

10:47.580 --> 10:51.551
Lemon... I think you're needed
on stage for rehearsal.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.856
Who's got a paintbrush for me?

11:04.531 --> 11:06.767
Hey, Shelley,
did you happen

11:06.800 --> 11:08.969
to see me leave here
last night with anyone?

11:09.002 --> 11:11.171
You were drunk and flirting
with every girl in here.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.172
Could've been anyone.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.673
You have any guesses?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.978
I guess her.
What'd you do that for?

11:18.011 --> 11:20.013
For calling me all drunk
for sex last night.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.749
Oh.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.751
Well, sorry.

11:23.784 --> 11:24.785
Here.

11:24.818 --> 11:25.685
(gasps)

11:25.719 --> 11:27.454
Like I would
ever wear that.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.822
So we didn't...?

11:28.856 --> 11:30.690
Of course not!
I turned you down.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.660
'Cause you'd already called
my married sister, you pig!

11:34.561 --> 11:36.797
Classy, Wade.

11:36.830 --> 11:37.597
Super classy!

11:37.630 --> 11:38.832
I wondered when you

11:38.866 --> 11:40.868
was gonna give me
that shirt back.

11:40.901 --> 11:44.037
This is not yours.
It's my sister's.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.808
Big Ethel?
I saw you when

11:47.841 --> 11:50.944
you snatched it
from my clothesline.
(relieved sigh)

11:50.978 --> 11:53.546
(chuckles):
Well... why-why
would I do that?

11:53.580 --> 11:56.716
Maybe 'cause you was
walking around naked
as the day is long.

11:56.750 --> 12:00.320
And you just keep
getting classier!

12:00.353 --> 12:01.989
(giggles)

12:02.022 --> 12:05.058
*

12:06.393 --> 12:09.129
"About binomial theorem,
I am teeming with a lot o' news,

12:09.162 --> 12:11.932
with many cheerful facts about
the square of the hypotenuse."

12:11.965 --> 12:13.300
Dear God.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.634
Yeah?
Hey.

12:14.667 --> 12:15.836
Hey. Hey.
Brick,

12:15.869 --> 12:17.737
have you ever dealt
with a patient

12:17.771 --> 12:19.506
who was stuck
in serious denial?

12:19.539 --> 12:21.708
(chuckles) First let me
relish the moment.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.477
(laughs) You've finally
come to me for a consult!

12:24.511 --> 12:26.513
Okay, okay, could we
please just get on with it?

12:26.546 --> 12:28.048
No, I'm still relishing.
(laughing)

12:28.081 --> 12:28.916
Brick!

12:28.949 --> 12:30.383
Oh, okay, okay.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.652
Well, you know,
a-a little short-term denial

12:32.685 --> 12:36.156
is a perfectly, uh,
healthy coping mechanism.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.525
Not in this case.
See, this guy just found out

12:38.558 --> 12:42.162
something terrible about
his fi... wife. His wife.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.198
Oh, I see, I see, mm-hmm.
Did Lemon put you up to this?

12:45.232 --> 12:46.266
What?
Dr. Hart,

12:46.299 --> 12:47.567
I am processing

12:47.600 --> 12:50.070
the information about my wife
in my own time,

12:50.103 --> 12:52.239
thank you very much,
and it is perfectly

12:52.272 --> 12:53.606
within reason for me to attend

12:53.640 --> 12:55.208
my own daughter's wedding
without a date.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.276
But I...
Now, if you will

12:56.309 --> 12:59.779
excuse me,
I have lines to learn.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.714
"I'm very good at integral
and differential calculus.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.616
"I... I know the
scientific names

13:03.650 --> 13:04.885
of beings animalculous." Yes!

13:04.918 --> 13:06.553
Yes, that's good, that's good.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.188
*

13:08.221 --> 13:10.757
* Three little maids who, all
unwary, come from a ladies' *

13:10.790 --> 13:13.693
* Seminary, freed
from its genius tutelary *

13:13.726 --> 13:16.396
* Three little maids
from school *

13:16.429 --> 13:18.298
* Three little maids

13:18.331 --> 13:19.566
* From school...

13:19.599 --> 13:21.835
*

13:21.869 --> 13:25.438
Wow. They're just lovely,
aren't they, Tom?

13:25.472 --> 13:28.408
Uh, uh... yes?

13:28.441 --> 13:29.676
Do you sing?

13:29.709 --> 13:32.079
Well... I...
(laughs)

13:32.112 --> 13:34.414
He's incredible.
Have you never heard
him in the church choir?

13:34.447 --> 13:36.183
Really fantastic voice.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.450
You know what?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.920
I think I'm gonna go
get some more paint.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.721
*

13:41.754 --> 13:43.423
(piano continues in distance)

13:43.456 --> 13:45.592
Thank you, sir.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.127
Oh, hey, Lemon.
Great rehearsal.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.096
You were really hitting
those high notes.
Stop it.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.164
Stop what? I thought I was
being perfectly friendly.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.399
Don't be friendly, George.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.467
Friendly is... insane, okay?

13:54.501 --> 13:56.703
I hurt you.
I betrayed you,

13:56.736 --> 13:59.839
so just yell at me
or scream at me or
something, please!

13:59.873 --> 14:01.041
There's no need for that.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.675
I get it-- you
had an affair,

14:02.709 --> 14:04.611
and I'm sure that you
are very, very sorry.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.279
I am so sorry.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.348
I am so, so, so, so sorry.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.750
Like I said,
I am sure you are.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.220
So does this... mean
that there's still hope

14:13.253 --> 14:14.621
for the wedding to be on?

14:14.654 --> 14:17.090
Not even an iota.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.591
DASH:
Lemon, George,

14:18.625 --> 14:20.160
come on, you're up.
You know what?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.962
I don't feel much like
rehearsing, and I got

14:21.995 --> 14:23.763
my part down pat,
so I'll just see you

14:23.796 --> 14:25.632
at the big show
tomorrow, okay?
What...?

14:25.665 --> 14:27.700
Wha...?
Thank you, Dash.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.171
*

14:31.204 --> 14:32.906
ZOE:
Hey.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.075
Hey, Zoe.
Hi, George.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.509
Hey, are we okay?

14:36.543 --> 14:37.710
Of course we are.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.446
Look... I want
to say I'm sorry

14:39.479 --> 14:41.381
for taking it all
out on you last night.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.051
I know that you were
just trying to do what's best.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.919
And, you know, you're
a really good friend--

14:45.953 --> 14:47.620
I just want
to tell you that.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.389
I am glad you
think so, pal.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.525
Hey, I was hoping
you might want to
watch a movie with me.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.061
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. I got, um,

14:54.094 --> 14:56.529
Unfaithful,
 Fatal Attraction,
(laughing)

14:56.563 --> 14:58.065
Obsessed...
Zoe...

14:58.098 --> 15:01.368
Look, George, I don't mean
to alarm you, but...

15:01.401 --> 15:04.337
all of that happiness you
feel is really major denial.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.605
It's not denial.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.674
And this happiness I feel...

15:07.707 --> 15:08.908
it's relief.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.677
See, I've been
walking around

15:10.710 --> 15:12.512
for six months
wondering why my fiancée

15:12.545 --> 15:13.947
was acting
all nutty and erratic,

15:13.981 --> 15:17.284
and now that I get it,
why, I feel...

15:17.317 --> 15:18.685
I feel free.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.088
Free?
Yeah. I get
to start over-- now,

15:21.121 --> 15:24.257
while I am still young
and vibrant and, let's face it,

15:24.291 --> 15:25.725
kind of cute.

15:26.693 --> 15:27.794
(laughs)

15:27.827 --> 15:29.129
All right, look, George,

15:29.162 --> 15:30.397
you need to process.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.664
No, no, no processing.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.034
See, what I need
to do... is live.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.236
Turns out that Lemon
wasn't the girl for me.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.637
She wasn't my destiny.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.173
So now it's my job
to go find out what...

15:40.207 --> 15:41.274
or who...

15:41.308 --> 15:44.044
that destiny is.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.679
Well, I guess that makes sense.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.849
So... Zoe Hart,

15:49.882 --> 15:54.454
I hope to see you around
again... really soon.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.024
*

16:10.137 --> 16:11.704
Yeah? That's it?

16:11.738 --> 16:13.406
Oh, Daddy,
not even close.

16:13.440 --> 16:17.010
If this were not charity,
I would quit it... right now.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.147
Are you okay, Lemon?

16:20.180 --> 16:21.481
You look kind of pale.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.416
No.
(scoffs):
Oh...

16:23.450 --> 16:25.652
it's all those
ridiculous hats she wears.

16:25.685 --> 16:26.786
She never gets

16:26.819 --> 16:28.321
any sun.
(laughs, sighs)

16:28.355 --> 16:29.756
I'm fine.

16:29.789 --> 16:30.923
I'm fine, Daddy.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.459
You stay healthy--
you know, this is

16:32.492 --> 16:35.528
a big month
for you, right?
Of course it is.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.164
You should really tell him.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.731
Oh, no, there's no need to.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.633
George and I are
gonna make it through.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.269
I have a new plan.

16:42.302 --> 16:45.205
What?
At the end of our Gilbert
and Sullivan song,

16:45.238 --> 16:48.508
I am gonna kiss him,
right there up on stage.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.742
And what?

16:49.776 --> 16:52.679
He'll get furious,
and fury will lead to a fight,

16:52.712 --> 16:55.014
and a fight will lead him
to let out his feelings,

16:55.048 --> 16:56.316
his anger, and we'll
talk through it,

16:56.349 --> 16:57.950
and then we'll live
happily, happily,

16:57.984 --> 16:59.452
happily, happily ever after.

16:59.486 --> 17:04.223
Whew. We really need to get
a shrink in this town.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.160
And if the girls club's

17:07.194 --> 17:09.996
gonna have its bake sale
on Wednesday, we'll need

17:10.029 --> 17:11.964
to change
the trash pickup.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.300
(frustrated sigh)

17:15.568 --> 17:18.137
(exhales)

17:21.973 --> 17:23.643
(light chuckle)
Uh...

17:23.675 --> 17:25.845
Selectwoman Blackwell,

17:25.877 --> 17:27.513
it has been a treat.
(chuckles)

17:27.547 --> 17:30.683
And, uh, I will
get back to you on
all those issues...

17:30.717 --> 17:32.585
promptly.

17:32.619 --> 17:33.853
Thank you, Mayor Hayes.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.188
Thank you for coming.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.591
All right.
You have a good old day.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.593
What is wrong with you?

17:40.627 --> 17:43.563
So very... very much.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.132
The shirt...

17:45.165 --> 17:47.434
was Ethel Warner's.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.735
No.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.870
No, no...

17:50.903 --> 17:52.939
No...
No, no, no, no. I...

17:52.972 --> 17:55.275
Apparently, I stole it
off her clothesline.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.976
Well, why'd you do that?

17:57.009 --> 17:59.679
Because I was naked.

17:59.712 --> 18:03.183
And I have no idea what
happened to my clothes.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.451
Or where my car is.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.786
Or why my arm is so damn itchy.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.020
That's a clue.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.489
Well, maybe it's an allergy.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.758
What are you allergic to?
Uh...

18:11.791 --> 18:14.794
pumpkins, birch beer, rabbits.

18:14.827 --> 18:18.030
Pumpkin season's over,
and I stay way the hell away

18:18.064 --> 18:20.400
from birch beer.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.770
Only person I know
with a pet rabbit is...

18:23.803 --> 18:26.139
Oh, dear God.
What?

18:26.173 --> 18:28.308
I know who exactly
who I was with last night.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.910
And I only wish it was
Big Ethel, 'cause this is...

18:30.943 --> 18:33.012
oh, this is so much worse.
Well, who could

18:33.045 --> 18:34.381
be worse than Big Ethel?

18:34.414 --> 18:35.382
Tansy.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.584
Your ex-wife.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.420
My ex-wife who's
still in love with me.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.690
God, I am such a jerk!

18:48.428 --> 18:49.929
*

18:49.962 --> 18:53.333
(motorcycle rumbling)

19:00.173 --> 19:02.375
So I see, you're not in denial,

19:02.409 --> 19:04.477
you're in an
erectile dysfunction ad.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.579
(chuckles):
Oh-ho...
Ha-ha. What is going on?

19:06.613 --> 19:10.550
Just realized that I'd been
part of an us for so long
that I'd lost sight of me,

19:10.583 --> 19:14.187
so I stayed up all
night and I made a list
of things, that, uh...

19:14.221 --> 19:16.823
that I want to do.
And one was dying

19:16.856 --> 19:18.057
in a motorcycle accident?
No, no.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.826
No, 'cause I have a
helmet, Doctor.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.060
Oh, good.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.496
What else is on this list?
Oh, so much.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.332
So much. A couple
of years ago,

19:25.365 --> 19:27.367
Lemon and I, we
went to New Orleans,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.969
and I saw this little
place, Bar Moreau.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.339
It had this incredible
old-time jazz band,

19:32.372 --> 19:34.507
it was decked out,
the place was amazing.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.977
I wanted to go in,
but Lemon wanted to
go to the opera.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.846
So... I'm going there now.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.349
Aren't you supposed to be
in Dash's revue tonight?

19:42.382 --> 19:44.016
Also something that Lemon
wanted to do, not me.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.386
And I'm not doing things
I don't want to do anymore.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.720
It is George Tucker time.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.188
(laughs):
Okay.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.823
You have fun.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.259
Oh, I will.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.826
Okay.
(chuckles)

19:53.860 --> 19:55.194
You have fun here.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.729
Oh, thanks.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.732
(sighs)
Don't die.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.168
*

20:09.175 --> 20:11.010
Hey, Tansy.
Hey.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.279
Thank you...

20:12.312 --> 20:13.880
for bringing my car back.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.248
It's the least I could do.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.750
And I'm sorry for,
uh... you know...

20:17.784 --> 20:19.118
(clears throat)

20:19.151 --> 20:21.421
...having drunk sex
with you last night.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.391
(laughs) Is that
what you think happened?

20:24.424 --> 20:27.560
Well, you were drunk,
but we did not have sex.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.128
We didn't?
Oh, you wanted to.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.298
You even took off your clothes

20:31.331 --> 20:32.432
to prove how much.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.866
But last time
I saw you,

20:33.900 --> 20:35.001
you gave me a speech

20:35.034 --> 20:36.168
about making better choices,

20:36.202 --> 20:37.270
and you were right.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.038
Which is why I kicked you out.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.007
Guess you were too
drunk to figure out

20:41.040 --> 20:42.775
how to put your
clothes back on.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.176
(laughs)

20:44.210 --> 20:47.447
Well, thank you
for having some good sense.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.649
At least one of us does.

20:49.682 --> 20:52.051
I'm trying.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.654
Actually, I'm going
to night school,

20:54.687 --> 20:55.822
studying cosmetology.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.023
Hey, all right!

20:57.056 --> 20:59.459
And I am steering clear
of men for now.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.461
I'm getting
my life together, and...

21:01.494 --> 21:04.096
it's all because of you
being so terrible to me.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.265
So thanks.
(chuckles)

21:06.299 --> 21:08.535
I should grab a cab.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.803
Yeah.
I have to study.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.509
*

21:20.513 --> 21:22.915
Well, it's not broken,
just a bad bruise.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.116
You are lucky.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.018
I got distracted
while I was hammering.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.220
I know I should've been
looking at what I was doing.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.689
It's just...

21:29.722 --> 21:31.858
I kinda have
a crush on someone.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.092
Anyone I know?

21:33.125 --> 21:35.962
Do you know Tom Long?
Tom... Long?

21:35.995 --> 21:37.764
You have a crush on Tom Long?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.399
Who wouldn't?

21:39.432 --> 21:44.103
He's sweet and funny and
handsome and good to his mama.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.339
He's just so shy.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.408
(cell phone rings)

21:48.441 --> 21:50.677
Hold that thought.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.911
Hello?

21:51.944 --> 21:53.980
Zoe Hart? I just wanted
to call and tell you

21:54.013 --> 21:56.783
that you are missing out,
because New Orleans is amazing.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.985
I mean, it's alive,
it's electric.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.454
And the food! I'm eating this
beignet right now,

22:01.488 --> 22:04.290
and I swear to you,
it is a religious experience.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.992
Well, I am glad
you are having fun.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.094
You know, you should
come join me.
W-W-What?

22:08.127 --> 22:10.597
New Orleans is like two hours
away. You come out here,

22:10.630 --> 22:12.699
we'll hang out, we'll,
uh, hear some jazz.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.501
And then you'd be home by
1:00 a.m., 2:00 at the latest.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.035
I don't know...
Oh, come on. Doc, hey.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.070
You need to get yourself
out of that stuffy office.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.840
You need to live a little. You
need to seize the day, Zoe Hart.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.042
Seize the day!
I'll think about it.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.210
Well, you do that.

22:24.243 --> 22:25.878
You think about that
real hard.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.381
Okay?
Bye.

22:31.551 --> 22:32.685
So, what do you think?

22:32.719 --> 22:34.521
What should I
do about Tom Long?

22:34.554 --> 22:36.122
I think you should
go for it.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.424
Really?
Sometimes...

22:37.457 --> 22:38.725
destiny gives us a window,

22:38.758 --> 22:40.593
and no matter how
crazy it may seem,

22:40.627 --> 22:43.362
you have to act on it
before that window closes.

22:43.396 --> 22:44.697
I have to go.

22:46.265 --> 22:48.367
(orchestral music plays)

22:50.269 --> 22:53.440
I just want to let you know
that George still isn't here.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.707
He's not?
Mm-mm.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.976
That's okay.
He will be.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.445
I'm not worried.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.913
First up is "Three Little
Maids." And for me,

23:00.947 --> 23:02.048
two little ear plugs.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.716
Come on.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.619
Magnolia, you get him
here, okay?

23:06.653 --> 23:09.255
Everything depends on this.
Everything.
Okay.

23:09.288 --> 23:11.390
Thank you.
Okay. Go, go, go.

23:15.462 --> 23:19.065
Lavon! Lavon, I need
to borrow your car

23:19.098 --> 23:22.168
and some cash for emergencies
and directions to New Orleans.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.303
And why are you going
to New Orleans?
To meet George.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.439
Dangerous territory, Zoe.
Very dangerous.

23:26.473 --> 23:29.509
But what if George
is my destiny,

23:29.542 --> 23:31.343
and this is my only chance?

23:32.344 --> 23:34.981
Let me remind you of one thing.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.383
George did not choose you.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.452
He found out
a secret about Lemon.

23:39.486 --> 23:40.853
Big difference.

23:50.463 --> 23:51.898
(lively piano tune plays)

23:51.931 --> 23:54.300
* I am the very model
of a modern major general *

23:54.333 --> 23:56.869
* I've information vegetable,
animal, and mineral *

23:56.903 --> 23:59.606
* I know the kings of
England and I quote the
fights historical *

23:59.639 --> 24:02.909
* From Marathon to Waterloo,
in order categorical *

24:02.942 --> 24:03.843
Did you find him yet?

24:03.876 --> 24:06.278
He's not at home
or his office.

24:06.312 --> 24:09.315
Lemon, where is George?
He's supposed to be getting

24:09.348 --> 24:10.817
into his costume!

24:10.850 --> 24:12.685
Oh, um, I forgot to tell you.

24:12.719 --> 24:15.722
Uh, George is very,
very, very sick.

24:15.755 --> 24:18.491
He has, um, a
terrible stomach bug.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.859
He's at home.
Weird.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.261
I saw him this morning riding
his new motorcycle.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.796
(laughs)
A motorcycle?

24:23.830 --> 24:26.198
No, that's crazy.
Don't worry.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.901
He was with Dr. Hart. I'm sure
she insisted he wear his helmet.

24:28.935 --> 24:32.404
Dr. Hart?

24:32.438 --> 24:34.106
I'll be right back!
DASH:
What?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.808
But you're up in two songs.

24:35.842 --> 24:39.579
BRICK: * I am the very model
of a modern major general. *

24:43.750 --> 24:48.220
* Jambalaya and a crawfish pie
and filé gumbo *

24:48.254 --> 24:53.192
* 'Cause tonight I'm
gonna see ma cher amie, oh *

24:53.225 --> 24:57.930
* Pick guitar, fill fruit jar
and be gay, oh *

24:57.964 --> 25:02.802
* Son of a gun, we're gonna have
big fun on the bayou *

25:02.835 --> 25:07.774
* Thibodeaux and Fontainenot,
the place is buzzin' *

25:07.807 --> 25:12.011
* Kinfolk come to see Yvonne
by the dozen *

25:12.044 --> 25:16.448
* Dress in style and go hog
wild, me oh, my oh *

25:16.482 --> 25:21.520
* Son of a gun, we're gonna have
big fun on the bayou *

25:21.554 --> 25:25.524
* Jambalaya and a crawfish pie
and filé gumbo *

25:25.558 --> 25:30.897
* 'Cause tonight I'm
gonna see ma cher amie, oh *

25:30.930 --> 25:36.135
* Pick guitar, fill fruit jar
and be gay, oh *

25:36.168 --> 25:41.073
* Son of a gun, we're gonna have
big fun on the bayou *

25:41.107 --> 25:45.311
* Son of a gun, we're gonna
have big fun on the bayou *

25:45.344 --> 25:50.349
* Son of a gun, we're gonna have
big fun on the bayou... *

25:50.382 --> 25:52.985
Whew!
(cheering and applause)

26:04.230 --> 26:05.632
Thank you, sir.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.200
*

26:08.234 --> 26:10.269
I did not know that
you could sing like that.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.804
Well, there are
a lot of things

26:11.838 --> 26:13.773
you don't know
about me, Zoe Hart.
I guess so.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.810
But I'm really
glad you came.

26:17.844 --> 26:21.280
'Cause now you can help me with
the next thing on my to-do list.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.282
Bartender,
two Hurricanes, please.

26:23.315 --> 26:24.516
I'm sorry to interrupt.

26:24.550 --> 26:26.018
But you were
great up there.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.553
Oh, thank you.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.121
Can we see you perform
anywhere else in town?

26:29.155 --> 26:32.124
Um, sorry,
that was actually
Hm.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.160
just kind
of a spontaneous thing, so...

26:34.193 --> 26:35.895
Oh.
But you are
a professional singer?

26:35.928 --> 26:36.863
(laughs)

26:36.896 --> 26:38.497
GEORGE:
No.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.432
Really? Actually, I'm a lawyer.

26:40.466 --> 26:43.302
You hear that, honey?
We're groupies for a lawyer.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.937
Oh, don't be embarrassed.

26:44.971 --> 26:47.339
You're not the first groupies
that this lawyer has had.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.308
Kim and Pablo Charlton.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.443
Um, George Tucker.
Hi, I'm Zoe.

26:51.477 --> 26:53.112
Hi.
You two from around here?

26:53.145 --> 26:55.715
No, we're just visiting.
Oh, so are we.
From New Jersey.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.216
Actually, we're
on our honeymoon.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.517
Oh, congratulations.

26:58.550 --> 27:01.053
And that is such a
coincidence, because...

27:01.087 --> 27:04.056
so are we.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.292
(chuckles)

27:08.127 --> 27:10.997
* I'm called Little Buttercup

27:11.030 --> 27:12.799
* Dear Little Buttercup

27:12.832 --> 27:16.602
* Though I could
never tell why... *

27:16.635 --> 27:18.170
Did you hear?
I got all the words right.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.806
Every single one!
(chuckles)

27:19.839 --> 27:21.007
Where's Lemon?

27:21.040 --> 27:22.608
Um... not really sure.
(nervous laugh)

27:22.641 --> 27:25.778
* Sweet Little Buttercup Pie

27:25.812 --> 27:28.414
We are going to have to
skip their number.

27:28.447 --> 27:31.083
Tom and I can fill in.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.919
Oh, he can sing.
He's in the choir.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.353
We can do it!
What...?

27:34.386 --> 27:35.822
* ...Pie!

27:35.855 --> 27:37.690
(song ends)

27:37.724 --> 27:38.925
Come on, Tom.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.626
Seize the day.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.628
Okay, we can do it.
(chuckles)

27:44.430 --> 27:46.733
(audience murmurs)

27:49.401 --> 27:50.770
(piano plays steady tune)

27:50.803 --> 27:53.773
* Oh, better far
to live and die *

27:53.806 --> 27:55.808
* Under the brave black
flag I fly *

27:55.842 --> 27:58.344
* Than play a
sanctimonious part *

27:58.377 --> 28:02.815
* With a pirate head
and a pirate heart *

28:02.849 --> 28:07.419
* Away to the
cheating world go you *

28:07.453 --> 28:10.589
* Where pirates are all
well-to-do. *

28:10.622 --> 28:13.459
* But I'll be true to
the song I sing *

28:13.492 --> 28:18.330
* And live and die
a Pirate King *

28:18.364 --> 28:23.669
* For I am a Pirate King

28:23.702 --> 28:26.172
* And it is, it is
a glorious thing *

28:26.205 --> 28:28.307
* To be a Pirate King

28:28.340 --> 28:30.676
* For I am
a Pirate King *

28:30.709 --> 28:32.812
* You are, hurrah for
the Pirate King! *

28:32.845 --> 28:35.381
* And it is, it is
a glorious thing... *

28:35.414 --> 28:37.116
Where are Lemon and George?

28:37.149 --> 28:38.717
It's not like them
to-to blow off

28:38.751 --> 28:41.053
an important talent event
and to miss my song.

28:41.087 --> 28:45.357
Daddy,
I have to tell you something.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.026
* ...to be
a Pirate King, it is! *

28:47.059 --> 28:52.164
* Hurrah for the Pirate King,
hurrah for the Pirate King! *

28:52.198 --> 28:55.667
(cheering and applause)

29:00.739 --> 29:02.708
KIM: So you don't
live anywhere?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.643
No, right now,
nothing's holding us down.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.678
We're just kind of,
untethered, free.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.215
You know, so we decided
to take a year off

29:09.248 --> 29:11.250
and travel...
Yeah.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.518
and see where
life takes us.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.887
Yeah, well we've
been all over.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.488
To Australia.
Oh, yeah.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.690
Europe...
Wow, so what's next?

29:18.724 --> 29:22.461
Uh, what's next on the
honeymoon is Uganda, actually.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.363
I have always wanted
to go to Uganda,

29:24.396 --> 29:26.765
to see the gorillas
in the wild.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.600
Me, too.

29:28.634 --> 29:31.871
KIM: You two lead
such an amazing life.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.706
We really do.
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen...

29:34.740 --> 29:37.910
we have a special guest
performer tonight.

29:37.944 --> 29:41.213
Please give a warm
New Orleans welcome

29:41.247 --> 29:44.050
to Mr. Scotty McCreery.

29:44.083 --> 29:47.887
(cheering and applause)

29:51.523 --> 29:53.392
Scotty McCreery, holy crap!

29:53.425 --> 29:56.695
If you'll excuse us, I, uh...

29:56.728 --> 29:58.965
I'm gonna go
dance with my bride.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.633
*

30:01.667 --> 30:02.634
Come on.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.003
(chuckles)

30:04.036 --> 30:07.806
* The trouble with girls
is they're a mystery *

30:07.840 --> 30:11.510
* Something about them
puzzles me *

30:11.543 --> 30:14.914
* I spend my whole life trying
to figure out *

30:14.947 --> 30:18.684
* Just what them girls
are all about *

30:18.717 --> 30:21.988
* The trouble with girls is
they're so dang pretty... *

30:22.021 --> 30:25.757
I should have known that we
would have so much in common.

30:26.425 --> 30:27.927
Zoe Hart,

30:27.960 --> 30:31.563
from the first day I picked you
up by the side of the road,

30:31.597 --> 30:33.465
you have gotten to me.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.701
It's been a great night.

30:37.003 --> 30:40.706
Do you have anything left on
your list that you want to do?

30:40.739 --> 30:42.041
*

30:42.074 --> 30:45.777
You know, I've done
every thing on my list.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.548
Except one...

30:49.581 --> 30:51.483
* They steal you with "Hello"

30:51.517 --> 30:54.686
* They kill you with
"Good-bye" *

30:54.720 --> 30:58.257
* They're the perfect drug

30:58.290 --> 31:01.860
* And I can't break free

31:01.894 --> 31:06.498
* Yeah, the trouble with girls

31:06.532 --> 31:12.471
* Is nobody loves
trouble as much as me. *

31:30.889 --> 31:33.559
So, what now?

31:33.592 --> 31:35.561
*

31:35.594 --> 31:37.729
Now...

31:37.763 --> 31:39.798
Now we spend the night.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.200
(chuckles)

31:41.233 --> 31:43.302
And be who we
just pretended we were,

31:43.335 --> 31:45.271
live our lives.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.273
Seize the day.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.042
You're right,
we should.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.644
We should.
Yeah.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.947
I'll get us a room, then.

31:54.981 --> 31:56.748
My mom knows somebody

31:56.782 --> 31:58.484
at every fancy hotel
in America.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.587
So, why don't you
let me make the call?

32:05.524 --> 32:07.526
*

32:16.868 --> 32:19.038
George?

32:19.071 --> 32:21.974
George, are you in there?!

32:22.008 --> 32:24.376
George?
BRICK:
Lemon?

32:25.811 --> 32:27.879
Hi, Daddy.

32:27.913 --> 32:31.050
Um... I was just, um...

32:31.083 --> 32:33.219
I was just checking to see

32:33.252 --> 32:36.322
if Zoe Hart had my wallet,
because I lost it,

32:36.355 --> 32:38.390
and somebody said
that she might have it.

32:38.424 --> 32:41.393
And I-I need to find it,
because it's really important.

32:41.427 --> 32:46.598
Honey, Magnolia told me
George broke off the wedding.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.134
What's going on?

32:49.601 --> 32:51.603
I messed up real bad.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.607
I messed up so bad, Daddy.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.445
I cheated on George.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.347
(murmurs)

33:02.714 --> 33:04.483
(sobbing)

33:09.921 --> 33:12.124
*

33:13.459 --> 33:15.194
Oh. Hey, Tom.

33:15.227 --> 33:18.830
So, I hear you solved
the mystery.
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.032
I'm sorry I couldn't be there

33:20.066 --> 33:22.168
to lend a hand,
but I had a big night.

33:22.201 --> 33:26.272
I was so scared, but... I sang.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.974
Hey. Hey, that's great.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.376
It was incredible.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.378
Up there on that stage
with Wanda,

33:32.411 --> 33:34.080
it felt like
everything was right.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.448
It felt like, uh, destiny.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.984
Destiny, huh?
I've been

33:39.017 --> 33:40.186
pining away for Zoe Hart

33:40.219 --> 33:43.622
for so long
that I nearly missed Wanda.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.357
Well, good for you.

33:45.391 --> 33:48.394
You know, I'm, uh...
I'm glad you found someone.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.929
Our life as wild bachelors
was incredible,

33:50.962 --> 33:52.898
but it's time to grow up.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.566
I'm nearly 23.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.370
I'm sorry, Wade...
but good-bye.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.674
All right, Tom.

34:09.915 --> 34:12.118
(phone beeps)

34:14.186 --> 34:17.822
Hey, Tansy, it's, uh...
it's Wade.

34:17.856 --> 34:21.893
(crowd chatter,
jazz playing)

34:21.927 --> 34:23.862
Pierre, a suite
would be perfect.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.964
Thank you so much.
Okay, bye.

34:25.996 --> 34:29.701
* I see trees of green

34:29.735 --> 34:33.071
* Red roses, too

34:33.105 --> 34:38.344
* I see them bloom
for me and for you *

34:38.377 --> 34:43.081
* And I think to myself

34:43.114 --> 34:47.386
* What a wonderful world

34:51.523 --> 34:55.327
* I see skies of blue

34:55.360 --> 34:59.265
* And clouds of white

34:59.298 --> 35:01.567
* The bright, blessed day

35:01.600 --> 35:04.470
* And the dark, sacred night

35:04.503 --> 35:09.541
* And I think to myself

35:09.575 --> 35:15.714
* What a wonderful world

35:17.616 --> 35:20.552
* I see friends shaking hands

35:20.586 --> 35:24.190
* Saying, "How do you do?"

35:24.223 --> 35:27.893
* They're really saying

35:27.926 --> 35:30.162
* I love you

35:30.196 --> 35:32.164
* I see skies of blue...

35:32.198 --> 35:34.766
Your wedding song.

35:34.800 --> 35:35.834
* And clouds of white

35:35.867 --> 35:38.304
It just took me by
surprise, that's all.

35:38.337 --> 35:40.306
* The bright, blessed day

35:40.339 --> 35:42.608
* And the dark, sacred night

35:42.641 --> 35:44.276
George...

35:44.310 --> 35:47.012
* And I think to myself

35:47.045 --> 35:50.048
...I think it's time to go home.

35:50.081 --> 35:53.819
* What a wonderful world

35:54.953 --> 35:59.625
* What a wonderful world.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.773
Wow! Nice hair.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.074
Very funny.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.244
We have to practice on
each other in class,

36:18.277 --> 36:20.045
and my partner went
a little overboard.

36:20.078 --> 36:22.614
No, no. It, uh...
it looks good.

36:22.648 --> 36:23.849
(laughs)

36:23.882 --> 36:26.017
Thank you for, uh...
for coming by.

36:26.051 --> 36:27.152
You're my only ex-husband.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.755
When you need
me, I'm here.

36:29.788 --> 36:30.622
What's going on?

36:30.656 --> 36:31.990
Well, you know, I was...

36:32.023 --> 36:33.292
I was just thinking

36:33.325 --> 36:35.227
about what you said,
about, uh...

36:35.261 --> 36:36.895
you know, about how
you're trying to change

36:36.928 --> 36:39.365
and-and do better, and, uh,

36:39.398 --> 36:40.832
well, it got me thinking.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.168
Getting drunk,

36:43.201 --> 36:46.672
going home with random women,
losing my clothes...

36:46.705 --> 36:47.773
(laughs)

36:47.806 --> 36:49.441
...I'm trying to put that
behind me, too.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.410
Is that so?
Obviously, I'm...

36:51.443 --> 36:52.911
I'm not doing perfectly.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.513
(laughs)
But, uh,

36:54.546 --> 36:55.714
I got a plan.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.049
I'm-I'm saving up money
to open my own bar.

36:58.083 --> 37:00.185
I think it could be
a pretty special place.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.053
Is that why you called me?

37:02.087 --> 37:04.189
To tell me
you're saving up for a bar?

37:04.222 --> 37:06.892
I guess I just wanted you
to know that, uh...

37:06.925 --> 37:10.329
well, I'm-I'm trying, too.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.833
Well, it's about time,
Wade Kinsella.

37:15.867 --> 37:18.770
(both laugh)

37:26.712 --> 37:28.680
Zoe, thank you...

37:28.714 --> 37:30.716
for everything.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.820
This night was magical.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.888
But...

37:36.922 --> 37:40.892
When the magic wears off,
reality will still be here.

37:40.926 --> 37:44.296
And you have to deal with it.

37:45.130 --> 37:46.898
Yeah.

37:46.932 --> 37:49.335
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:03.949 --> 38:04.883
Hey, George.

38:04.916 --> 38:05.917
(groans)

38:08.420 --> 38:10.622
(Lavon groans)

38:13.959 --> 38:15.961
Okay, I-I... I
did feel that.

38:18.364 --> 38:20.332
(Lavon sighs)

38:20.366 --> 38:22.300
I'm sorry, Daddy.

38:22.334 --> 38:26.137
You must be
so disappointed in me.

38:26.171 --> 38:28.974
No.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.109
We all make mistakes.

38:31.142 --> 38:34.279
All of us do. It's okay.

38:37.783 --> 38:42.187
Do you think George...
is gonna come back?

38:44.456 --> 38:46.892
I don't know.

38:48.427 --> 38:50.596
Tell you what I do know.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.964
(crying)

38:52.998 --> 38:55.467
Unlike your dear old dad,

38:55.501 --> 39:00.406
you... are resilient.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.142
No matter what happens,
you will go on.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.745
That much I know.

39:10.382 --> 39:13.318
I can't sleep.
Is everything okay?

39:14.853 --> 39:17.856
Hey, Magpie, why don't
you go on back to bed?

39:17.889 --> 39:20.125
You know? I mean, you
got school tomorrow.

39:20.158 --> 39:21.693
I want to help.

39:21.727 --> 39:22.928
What can I do?

39:22.961 --> 39:26.498
Um, you can, um...

39:28.900 --> 39:32.203
...make a list of all the people
that we need to call

39:32.237 --> 39:34.740
to tell them
that the wedding is off.

39:34.773 --> 39:39.210
Okay, but don't make me
call Aunt Lavinia.

39:39.244 --> 39:40.846
(laughs)

39:40.879 --> 39:43.782
(knocking)

39:52.724 --> 39:55.461
*

40:13.278 --> 40:15.581
George, where have you been?

40:18.116 --> 40:19.751
Are you okay?

40:19.785 --> 40:21.352
(sighs)

40:21.386 --> 40:23.354
How could you...

40:23.388 --> 40:25.256
do that, Lemon?

40:25.290 --> 40:27.258
How...

40:27.292 --> 40:28.994
How could you do that to me?

40:29.027 --> 40:31.830
How could you
do that to us?

40:31.863 --> 40:32.864
I loved you, Lemon.

40:32.898 --> 40:35.100
So, no, I am not okay.

40:35.133 --> 40:38.136
I am hurt, and I am...
I am angry!

40:38.169 --> 40:40.371
(crying)
I know.

40:41.306 --> 40:43.509
I know.

40:45.811 --> 40:48.246
(crying)

40:48.279 --> 40:50.482
(groans softly)

40:51.683 --> 40:53.384
So, how was New Orleans?

40:53.418 --> 40:55.220
I had a perfect night.

40:55.253 --> 40:57.055
Well, almost perfect.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.557
But you were right.

40:58.590 --> 41:01.192
It's too soon for George
to start a new relationship.

41:01.226 --> 41:02.761
So I'm glad that we came home

41:02.794 --> 41:04.796
before we both did
something we'd regret.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.101
You seem oddly, uh...

41:10.135 --> 41:11.803
What is that look on your face?

41:11.837 --> 41:13.572
Hope.

41:13.605 --> 41:16.642
'Cause now I know
that George and I would be...

41:16.675 --> 41:19.144
that we could be great together.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.312
Wow.

41:21.346 --> 41:23.649
I really hope
everything works out for you.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.618
I do.

41:51.409 --> 41:53.579
