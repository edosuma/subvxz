[ Male Interviewer]
I gotta say,

00:30.948 --> 00:33.200
that was really some
pulse-quickening action right there.

00:33.284 --> 00:35.775
I mean you guys are—
are awesome.

00:35.870 --> 00:39.658
Uh, Blaine, what’s
it been like playing a role
like Special Agent Andy Lister?

00:39.749 --> 00:42.491
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

00:42.585 --> 00:45.577
Now, Cherie, the role
of Dr. Kathy Reichs...

00:45.671 --> 00:47.662
must have been
quite a departure for you.

00:47.757 --> 00:49.372
Actually, no, not at all.

00:49.467 --> 00:52.550
| feel like in many ways
I could be Dr. Reichs.

00:52.637 --> 00:55.049
The only difference is
maybe she went to college.

00:55.139 --> 00:59.678
But other than that,
our essence is very, very similar.

00:59.769 --> 01:01.054

Awesome.

01:01.145 --> 01:02.976
I know you have
to get back to filming.

Apparently
the movie is awesome.
Apparently everything is.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.787
How come they didn’t
interview the actors
playing the other scientists?

01:25.878 --> 01:27.584
I mean, they’re just as important.

01:29.799 --> 01:32.256
Can we see that first part again—
them blowing up?

01:32.343 --> 01:34.379
- Yeah.
- Because it’s awesome?

None of this
was in my script.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.782
What? What are you
talking about?
That’s all you.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.405
The studio just wanted
a couple of tweaks.

02:00.496 --> 02:02.828
They do this all the time, Bones.
These doughnuts are amazing.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.622
l have the utmost respect
for your work, Dr. Brennan. Really.

02:05.710 --> 02:08.201
You have a fire in an ice palace.
Where did that come from?

02:08.296 --> 02:10.127
The grease fire
you had in the diner,
that you wrote—

02:10.214 --> 02:11.795
ljust tweaked it a little bit.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.043
Why did you change the name
of the Jeffersonian?

02:14.176 --> 02:17.088
Washington Institute

gives us that cool acronym— WISK.

02:17.179 --> 02:20.137

Wow.

I’m a little shiny, Jocco.
Just a minute.

- Maybe you shouldn’t let
so many people polish you.
- Oh, back off, limpy.

So if there’s anything you need,
any questions—

02:55.718 --> 02:58.960
Well, I was wondering about, uh,
some of the changes to the script.

- Wonderful, aren’t they?
- Actually, there are some
mistakes in the science—

03:30.211 --> 03:32.327

an accident to you?

03:32.421 --> 03:34.377
No, this was definitely
no accident.

03:34.465 --> 03:37.502
The victim suffered
a penetrating trauma
to the chest bones,

03:37.593 --> 03:39.709
followed by a massive
cardiacal eruption.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.678
“Cardiacal” is not a word.
It’s what?
Just roll with it.

03:42.765 --> 03:44.380
I could extract the medial epicondyle...

03:44.475 --> 03:46.011
and have the WISK team run tests...

03:46.102 --> 03:48.013
to see if she was a member
of Dimitri’s terrorist group.

03:48.104 --> 03:49.969
The medial epicondyle
is not in the chest.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.186
Our victim was near an olive grove.

with just a magnifying glass.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.563

She’s very excited.

She’s been waiting
a long time for this film.

04:16.465 --> 04:19.423
Don’t you want to be accurate?
You just can’t rip open
a chest cavity like that.

04:19.552 --> 04:22.919
And the dialogue—
l... don’t care.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.880
Okay? I’m the only one
that says “action,”

04:25.975 --> 04:27.761

that says “cut.”

- Right. Reset. Back to one.

read the new script,

04:41.949 --> 04:44.531

are still in there.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.781
Yeah, but not in any of the big
new action sequences.

04:47.872 --> 04:50.614

to put your character
in the movie more...

together.

- Marty.
- I’m sorry, but
none of this is my fault.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.472
And Jocco doesn’t care
if the science is accurate.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.269
He just wants everything
to look good on film.

This is a real dead body.

06:26.512 --> 06:29.470
[ Jocco ] What?
[ Man ]
Oh, my God. Ugh!

06:29.557 --> 06:31.468

06:31.559 --> 06:33.220
[ Groans ]

07:17.563 --> 07:20.100
[Cam ] I hear
Dr. Brennan
sent pictures.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.567
Yeah. At first,
I thought she
was joking.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.187
Looks like a prop, right?

07:24.278 --> 07:26.894
A really good prop.
Do we know who it is?

07:26.989 --> 07:29.822
Not yet. No one’s
been reported missing
on the movie lot.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.285
She wants me to start
a facial reconstruction.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.031
Maybe if we solve this case,
they’ll put us in the movie more.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.862
I think we’re getting
ahead of ourselves.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.697
This isn’t even
our jurisdiction.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.117
Hmm. It could be.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.827
[Mandy] That’s it.
/’m shutting down the mo vie.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.913
No, no. You can’t
shut down the movie.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.999
l’ll examine the remains.
That’s what I do.

07:48.093 --> 07:51.176
Mike here is the head of security.
He says we need to shut down.

07:51.263 --> 07:54.346
- L.A.P.D. should be here any minute.
- The FBI. is already here.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.306
That should be enough,
right, Booth?
Huh?

07:56.393 --> 07:59.180
Heat from inside the closed body bag
sped decomposition.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.387
I agree. I put time of death...

08:01.482 --> 08:03.188
between 90 and a hundred hours.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.652
The victim appears to be male,
mid-40s.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.272
God. Stop touching it.

08:07.363 --> 08:10.230
The press on this
is going to be a nightmare.

08:12.076 --> 08:13.907
Why don’t we solve
this murder?

08:13.994 --> 08:15.825
No,no,no,no,no.
We can’t do that. No.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.574
Please? You know that we can.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.280
Dr. Filmore can assist me.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.707
It was more cost-effective for Production
to rent real equipment...

08:21.794 --> 08:24.786
than to build look-alikes, so this is actually
a fully functioning laboratory.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.166
And you are a federal agent.
You can claim jurisdiction.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.793
You know the department
will back you.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.416
[ Groans ]
Please, please.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.547
I’ve been dreaming of making
a movie my whole life.

08:32.638 --> 08:36.301
Are you gonna let one
little decomposing corpse
get in the way of that?

08:37.810 --> 08:39.266
[Sighs]

08:40.562 --> 08:42.769
Okay. Let me do this.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.563
Okay. So, tell you what.
You don’t want bad press?

08:45.651 --> 08:48.688
Why don’t you have
the real Reichs and Lister
solve the murder for you?

08:48.779 --> 08:50.610
Makes for a great story,
doesn’t it?

08:57.121 --> 08:58.702
Give him whatever he needs.

08:58.831 --> 09:01.948
If you solve this,
remember, it was all my idea.
[Cell Phone Rings]

09:03.210 --> 09:06.122
Clooney?
You are such a rascal.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.091
Wow. I feel like I’m looking
at our lab...

09:16.181 --> 09:17.557
after a hea I/y night of o’r/n/(ing.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.097
It’s actually
state of the art.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.685
I helped them
rent the equipment.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.260
Which would explain
the abundance
of podiatry equipment.

09:23.355 --> 09:27.894
There’s a profusion
of perimortem bone damage...

09:27.985 --> 09:29.725
to the arms and the torso,

09:29.820 --> 09:32.232
as well as a skull fracture.

09:32.322 --> 09:37.942
’Kay. Could you direct
the camera closer
to the left costal margin?

09:38.036 --> 09:39.947
Based on staining
of surrounding tissue,

09:40.038 --> 09:42.370
I’d say cause of death
was a punctured aorta.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.200
- He b/eo’ out.
- Excuse me. Dr. Brennan?

09:45.294 --> 09:48.786
Oh, Mr. Summers.
Dr. Saroyan,
this is Mr. Summers.

09:48.881 --> 09:51.497
He plays Dr. Yagher—
the Hodgins character.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.548
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

09:53.635 --> 09:57.048
Um, Dr. Brennan, you—
We Will be on call
if you need anything.

09:57.139 --> 09:58.595
Fine.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.343
I’m sorry to bother you.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.049
| forgot some stuff up here,

10:02.144 --> 10:04.135
and they said I could get it
if Security escorted me.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.392
If you don’t touch the remains
or the surrounding surfaces.

10:07.483 --> 10:10.225
It seems that
the compound fracture...

10:10.319 --> 10:12.651
to the victim’s left seventh rib...

10:12.738 --> 10:15.024
could be what punctured
his aorta.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.528
I’m seeing bits of foliage
on the victim’s shoes.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.826
That’s from
the Lauraceae family,

10:20.913 --> 10:23.029

10:25.209 --> 10:28.201
I can’t believe that this
is a real, dead body.

I can’t believe
you identified the foliage.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.415
Oh, I have
a doctorate in botany.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.122
And one in microbiology.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.959
And | dabbled a bit in entomology
as an undergrad.

10:36.053 --> 10:39.011
That’s how I got this part.
I wasn’t intimidated by all the lab—speak.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.598
I don’t understand.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.640
If you have a useful talent,
why are you an actor?

10:43.727 --> 10:46.389
Well, acting’s always
been my first love,

10:46.480 --> 10:48.516
and love always wins out
in the end, right?

10:48.607 --> 10:51.690
Kind of like
a methicillin-resistant

the science sometimes.

Anyway, good luck
with your investigation.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.450
Dr. Summers, where did you
do your graduate work?

11:06.542 --> 11:09.830

was Dr. Lily Jacobson.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.332
I know Dr. Jacobson.

11:12.422 --> 11:16.085
Have you ever used
a G.C. mass spectrometer?

11:17.928 --> 11:20.169
All your actors
have criminal
records here.

11:20.264 --> 11:21.629
Mostly drugs, drunk driving,

11:21.723 --> 11:22.849

They say it’s part
of their process.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.225
Right. And you say
your security is tight here?

11:27.312 --> 11:28.848
It’s tough to get on the lot,
but, once you’re here,

11:28.939 --> 11:30.520
you can pretty much
go anywhere.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.472
What about leaving?
You check
the vehicles?

11:32.609 --> 11:34.520
Uh, random searches, yeah.
Huh.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.525
The killer
probably hid
the body here...

11:38.615 --> 11:40.901
’cause it was
too risky
to move it.

20:04.037 --> 20:07.450
[Chuckles]
Dude, lwasjust
trying to get on TMZ,

20:07.540 --> 20:09.041
so I slugged a few people.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.865
Look,
everybody hated Hanson.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.461
Jocco hated him.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.331
Cherie used him
and then hated him.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.003
Everybody in Publicity
hated him.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.544
Mandy hated him.
Everybody hated him.
Okay, great.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.375
You know what?
I’m gonna check out your alibi.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.301
Stay close.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.845
Sure.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.679
Can I have my gun?
Yeah.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.765
[Laughs]
Huh? Right?
You.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.054
You’re good.
Yep.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.225
Look at that.

20:30.313 --> 20:33.271
Whew! F.B.|.!
F.B.|.!

20:33.400 --> 20:35.607
See what I gotta deal with?
F.B.|.!
Drop your weapon.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.354
His belt buckle says “Kooky.”

20:37.445 --> 20:39.527
lcan see the McQueen thing
though.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.317
Yeah?
Yeah.

20:42.409 --> 20:45.196
Little bit.
Little bit.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.572
There was nothing of value
on Stephens’s cell phone,

20:47.664 --> 20:51.623
but I did notice that he subscribed
to a remote backup service.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.961
Which means that even if
something was erased,

20:54.087 --> 20:57.375
you could access it
via the backup service?
Exacﬂy.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.922
Here’s a call from Friday,
8:47 pm,

21:00.009 --> 21:01.795
which is the night
he disappeared.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.001
It was deleted later.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.586
[Man]
Hey, it’s me.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.296
l’m not gonna get screwed
by you again, Hanson.

21:06.391 --> 21:09.633
if you wanna apologize,
/’// be here all night
Otherwise, you’re dead to me.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.513
Well, that certainly
sounds hostile.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.562
Yeah.
It came from the studio.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.561
I ran the extension
through the studio directory.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.985
[ Saroyan ]
“Liam Toynen. Bungalow 314.”

21:21.114 --> 21:25.904
Isn’t he the guy who rewrote
Dr. Brennan’s script?
Yes, he is.

21:25.994 --> 21:30.454
And the studio IT. guys
flagged him for searching
questionable Web sites.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.201
And there’s this.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.667
“The Perfect Murder.”
Yep.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.540
Looks like this one
wasn’t perfect enough, Liam.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.130
Bart. It’s Bart Simpson.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.836
Hey, look at that.
[Clicking Tongue]

21:46.931 --> 21:48.467
Hey, Bones, come on.

21:48.558 --> 21:50.765
Take a picture—
me and Bart.
For Parker, huh?

21:50.852 --> 21:53.639
Booth, Bungalow 314.
Huh?

21:53.730 --> 21:55.470
- And look.
- What are you doin’?

21:55.565 --> 21:58.773
The sprinkler head.
The shape could match
the victim’s head injury.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.692
It’s made out of brass,
right?

22:01.779 --> 22:03.360
Yes, but it’s clean.

22:03.448 --> 22:05.188
How about that one over there?

22:14.792 --> 22:16.953
- Blood.
- Blood.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.500
We heard
your voice message
to Hanson.

22:25.595 --> 22:26.584
Yeah?
Yeah.

22:26.679 --> 22:27.839
So—
[ Stammers ]

22:27.931 --> 22:29.467
What, you’ve
never been angry
with anyone before?

22:29.557 --> 22:30.967
Why are we talking
on the set?

22:31.100 --> 22:32.806
Because this
is official business—
Okay.

22:32.894 --> 22:35.761
and so this is almost
my official office.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.265
Right, Bones?
Sure.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.313
On the voice message,

22:39.400 --> 22:42.392
you ask Hanson Stephens
to come to your bungalow
late at night.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.728
It’s not
a polite invitation.

22:44.822 --> 22:47.689
Yeah. He was trying
to get me to do a draft
of a script for free.

22:47.784 --> 22:50.992
I don’t work for free,
so we had a little bit
of a disagreement.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.910
Maybe you had that disagreement
outside the bungalow,

22:52.997 --> 22:55.534
because that is where he died.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.874
What?
Let’s take a look
at this, huh?

22:57.961 --> 22:59.952
“How to Commit
the Perfect Murder.”

23:00.046 --> 23:01.957
Why were you looking
at this Web site?

23:02.048 --> 23:04.414
Okay, that’s research.
I’m-I’m doing a thriller.

23:04.509 --> 23:06.921
Don’t you do research
on the Internet when you write?

23:08.054 --> 23:10.340
Oh, I-I do actually.

23:10.431 --> 23:12.137
What happened when Stephens
showed up that night?

23:12.225 --> 23:13.886
He didn’t show up.
That’s the thing.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.218
He usually comes by,
apologizes and, you know,

23:16.312 --> 23:18.303
gives me a few hundred grand
to finish the draft.

23:19.315 --> 23:20.896
A few hundred grand?
Yeah.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.526
For what?
I’m in demand.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.350
But you were on the lot
that night.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.276
Yeah. I was writing
your thing.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.442
You didn’t hear any fighting
outside or anything?
Look,guys.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.945
I would be an idiot
to kill Hanson, okay?

23:31.035 --> 23:32.866
The guy paid me buckets
to write crap.

23:32.954 --> 23:36.071
- Hey.
- Crap? You’re writing my film.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.701
Sorry to burst your bubble,

23:37.792 --> 23:39.453
but the only reason
that he green-lit your film...

23:39.544 --> 23:41.535
was to get into
Cherie Redfern’s pants.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.540
_ SO—
- Ooh!

23:44.799 --> 23:47.290
- The ice palace is stupid.
- Yeah, it is dumb.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.341
_ SO—
- It is kind of dumb.

23:49.429 --> 23:50.509
Stupid.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.100
[Laughs]

23:58.187 --> 24:01.224
This is a still from
in I/asion of the Mother Suckers.

24:01.316 --> 24:03.682
Oh, my God.
That’s Cam.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.607
We have gotta get our hands
on a copy of this movie.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.185
Yeah. Absolutely.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.396
But I-I thought you said
this was out of print.

24:11.034 --> 24:13.525
You’re telling me
you have millions of dollars
of computer equipment...

24:13.620 --> 24:16.407
and you can’t rustle up a copy
of in I/asion of the Mother Suckers .7

24:17.332 --> 24:18.822
I’m on it.

24:20.251 --> 24:22.242
[Chattering ]

24:25.131 --> 24:29.921
I met Hanson at a charity event
four months ago.

24:30.011 --> 24:32.673
He was... so charming.
We just clicked.

24:32.764 --> 24:37.133
Right. And after you clicked,
he offered you the lead
in, uh, Bone of Contention.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.386
Yeah.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.093
But he respected my talent.

24:40.188 --> 24:42.770
I’m not one of those actresses
that just sleeps her way
to the top.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.393
Right.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.105
Right, I don’t think
he was treating you right.

24:48.196 --> 24:50.357
I mean, he did offer you
a role in his next film,

24:50.448 --> 24:52.985
but he gave the lead
to Jennifer Garner, right?

24:53.076 --> 24:55.738
I’m not gonna lie.
Hanson could be a real bastard.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.035
But I’m not the only one
who felt that way.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.864
That skank Mandy has wanted
his job for two years.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.040
She’s probably refurnished
his office already.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.789
- [ Knocking ]
- 4 Mi amor? Preparate, mi amor.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.166
Wait, What— No, Nando,
please, don’t. Wait.

25:08.257 --> 25:11.545
- Oh-ho. So you’re sleeping
with him too?
- Huh?

25:11.636 --> 25:13.251
Why do you say it like that?
Because I’m a gardener?

25:13.346 --> 25:16.053
What does he mean by “too”?
Who else can give you
what I can do?

25:16.140 --> 25:17.846
I don’t know.
Can you offer her
a lead in a film?

25:17.934 --> 25:20.095
Can we just save this
for later, please?

25:20.186 --> 25:23.553
I’ll have you know
I’m a producer in Mexico.
Two films.

25:23.648 --> 25:25.229
One went to Sundance.

25:25.316 --> 25:29.400
Right. 80 then you probably
know who Cherie here
is sleeping with.

25:29.487 --> 25:32.069
[ Exhales ]
How am I gonna
say no to Hanson?

25:32.156 --> 25:35.398
- It is a simple,
one-syllable word.
- [ Booth ] Excuse me. Psst.

25:35.493 --> 25:37.700
I’d like to know
where you both were
last Friday night.

25:37.787 --> 25:40.324
Oh, uh, I was on set
filming all night.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.196
You can ask Jocco.
Jocco.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.906
How about you, Sundance boy?

25:44.001 --> 25:47.129
I was at a Robert McKee
writing seminar.
I have receipts.

25:47.213 --> 25:50.171
Great. We’ll check all that out.
You two stick close, okay?

25:50.258 --> 25:51.589
Good luck, kid.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.796
He was gonna give my role
to Jennifer Garner.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.388
What was I supposed to do?

25:56.472 --> 25:58.963
Mi amor. Please?

26:07.608 --> 26:09.064
Oh, Dr. Brennan, good.

26:09.152 --> 26:12.064
I noticed a roughness
on two of the victim’s
left metacarpals.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.770
And upon magnification,

26:13.865 --> 26:17.699
it became clear that there
were minute shards of debris
embedded in the bone,

26:17.785 --> 26:20.242
and it looks like glass.

26:20.329 --> 26:24.789
When Barry returns from filming,
see that he and Dr. Hodgins
analyze the shards.

26:24.876 --> 26:26.457
Mmm.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.081
Oh, what’s that?
It’s a map of the studios.

26:30.173 --> 26:31.879
I just got it
from the groundskeeper.

26:31.966 --> 26:35.129
I’ve shaded the areas
with Laurus nobi/is foliage,

26:35.219 --> 26:36.800
which we found on the victim.

26:36.888 --> 26:39.254
But none is near the murder site.

26:39.348 --> 26:42.010
The murder took place
on a surface covered
with grass,

26:42.101 --> 26:45.093
a scenario every
forensic podiatrist
dreams of.

26:45.188 --> 26:46.894
I can make sonographic
representations...

26:46.981 --> 26:49.939
of all the impressions
made in the underlying dirt,

26:50.026 --> 26:52.517
then reconstruct exactly
what happened in the attack.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.944
But the crime scene
is five days old.
People have been walking on it.

26:55.031 --> 26:57.067
No problem.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.115
Are you afraid that I,

27:00.203 --> 27:02.945
humble podiatrist
and overpaid
film consultant,

27:03.039 --> 27:04.825
might uncover information
that you couldn’t?

27:04.916 --> 27:07.658
This is not a competition,
Dr. Filmore.

27:07.752 --> 27:10.744
Oh, yes, it is,
Dr. Brennan.

27:12.673 --> 27:16.712
So, uh, Mike, he, uh,
offered me a job.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.634
What? Here?

27:18.721 --> 27:21.007
We live 3,000 miles away.
That doesn’t make any sense.

27:21.098 --> 27:23.475
Double the pay.
You know, less danger.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.424
Except for the killings.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.385
One every now and then
will keep us fresh.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.970
Besides, the other night
you said...

27:29.065 --> 27:31.772
you loved looking
at the ocean from the hotel.

27:31.859 --> 27:34.646
I do, as long as I don’t think
about the fecal contamination...

27:34.737 --> 27:36.443
from improperly handled runoff.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.897
Right. That’s true.
It’s a bad idea.

27:42.203 --> 27:43.818
What did you find?
Oh. Oh.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.494
So I tracked down
the director.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.742
He’s now
a high school teacher
in Pittsburgh.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.540
But he just sent me
an e-mail...

27:49.627 --> 27:53.211
that he has a copy of
in vasion of the Mother Suckers
in his garage.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.709
Yes!
[Filmore ]
Excuse me.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.665
Yoo-hoo.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.125
Sorry.
Are you ready?

27:59.220 --> 28:00.881
Oh, my God.

28:00.972 --> 28:02.462
What are you wearing?

28:02.557 --> 28:04.513
it’s called
the Gait Replicator.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.683
Yeah, he’s gonna
re-create what happened
at the murder site.

28:07.770 --> 28:11.763
We’re linking up
his Robocop suit
into the Angelatron.

28:11.858 --> 28:15.350
And the replicator
can mimic exactly...

28:15.444 --> 28:18.186
the height, bone structure...

28:18.281 --> 28:21.444
and the weight distr/bution
of the victim.

28:21.534 --> 28:26.244
When I walk on
the pressure-sensitive
computerized mat,

28:26.330 --> 28:31.450
e very step / take
shows up on the grid
on the Angelatron.

28:31.544 --> 28:33.500
We cross-reference it against
the topographical map...

28:33.588 --> 28:35.044
of what happened
at the murder site.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.122
Then we factor in
soil density.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.707
And then we extrapolate
which ones came
from the assailant.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.339
That is— That is brilliant.

28:42.430 --> 28:43.886
/ know.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.134
Dr. Brennan
will be green with envy.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.763
We 7/ be able to reconstruct
the entire murder scenario.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.643
I’m gloating. I apologize.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.646
Canadians shouldn’t gloat.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.853
[ Brennan ]
Angela took
Dr. Filmore’s data...

28:59.947 --> 29:02.859
and discovered that Stephens
was running from someone—

29:02.950 --> 29:04.906
well, something actually.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.825
They found partial tire tracks.

29:06.913 --> 29:08.619
So you’re saying
that Stephens got run over?

29:08.706 --> 29:12.198
That would certainly
be consistent with
the nature of his injuries.

29:12.293 --> 29:15.660
The car knocked him
into the sprinkler head,

29:15.755 --> 29:17.916
causing the skull fracture,

29:18.007 --> 29:21.340
uh, breaking his rib,
which punctured his aorta
and killed him.

29:21.427 --> 29:24.169
Okay,
so, why are we here?

29:25.306 --> 29:28.139
Based on bone density
and fracture depth—

29:28.267 --> 29:30.679
Yeah.
it was a small,
light vehicle.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.886
Bones, look at the leaves.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.357
Right under the front fender,
huh?

29:35.441 --> 29:38.933
Looks like Mandy Oh
really wanted that job.

29:41.155 --> 29:42.691
- Uh-oh.
[ Chuckles ]
- Oh, that’s funny.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.814
Do you get it?
Mandy Oh. Right.

29:50.206 --> 29:54.575
You cannot seriously be
accusing me of killing Hanson.

29:54.669 --> 29:56.580
The tire width
and the bumper height—

29:56.712 --> 29:58.668
[Cell Phone Rings]
are consistent
with his injuries.

29:58.756 --> 30:00.747
- Turn that off.
- It’s the board of directors.

30:00.841 --> 30:05.335
- I am next in line—
- I know, and Hanson Stephens
stood in your way.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.090
Who’d you talk to? Nick?

30:07.181 --> 30:09.593
That little brownnose
who thinks he knows everything
’cause he went to Harvard.

30:09.684 --> 30:12.471
Ever think he killed Hanson
because he wants my job?

30:12.561 --> 30:15.598
A circuitous but
creative motive for murder.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.521
I could use it in my next book.

30:17.608 --> 30:20.520
Look, I don’t see why
you don’tjust arrest
the Mexican gardener.

30:20.611 --> 30:25.696
- On what charge?
- He and Stephens were both
shtupping Cherie, right?

30:25.783 --> 30:27.068
He’s probably illegal
anyway.

30:28.244 --> 30:29.984
You’re being incredibly racist.

30:30.079 --> 30:33.446
- Not incredibly.
- Fernando’s alibi checked out.
It was strong.

30:33.541 --> 30:37.375
How do you explain the damage
to your car and the foliage
in your undercarriage?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.545
That probably happened
last week.

30:44.885 --> 30:47.592
Hey, you. Bush lady.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.547
Remember last week when
l swerved into the giraffe
’cause I was texting,

30:50.641 --> 30:53.849
and you got all hysterical
and said that I hurt its leg?

30:53.936 --> 30:56.348
Yes. I’m sorry about that.

30:56.439 --> 30:57.895
I apologized.

30:57.982 --> 31:01.850
Could we get
a cutting of the foliage
from that giraffe, please?

31:01.944 --> 31:03.354
Sure.

31:03.446 --> 31:04.936
Is she in trouble?

31:05.031 --> 31:06.942
That’s what we’re trying
to find out.

31:13.914 --> 31:16.166
[ Hodgins ]
These leaves
from Mandy Oh ’s car—

31:16.250 --> 31:18.582
they don’t match the leaves
found on the victim.

31:18.669 --> 31:20.500
So / guess
she was tell/ng the truth.

31:20.588 --> 31:23.375
How’s it coming
with the fragments that were
embedded in the victim is hands ?

31:23.466 --> 31:25.297
Still waiting on the results
from the mass spec.

31:25.384 --> 31:30.879
- I-I gotta tell you, Barry,
you’re doin’ a great job.
- Yeah?

31:30.973 --> 31:33.055
You should have
a much bigger part
in the ﬁlm.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.598

Where would they be without
the bug-and-s/ime guy, r/ght?

31:37.021 --> 31:39.683
Tell me about it.
They don’t even
understand my dialogue.

31:39.774 --> 31:41.355
it is really interesting.

“Dr. Reichs,

31:44.653 --> 31:48.487
pertains to particulates
presented primarily postmortem.”

31:48.574 --> 31:51.532
- Damn. That is a beautiful line.
- Right?

31:51.619 --> 31:53.701
We’re so unappreciated.

31:53.788 --> 31:55.619
I’ve been pushing
to get you guys a cameo.

31:55.706 --> 31:57.162
How cool would that be?

31:57.249 --> 32:00.412
I don’t know.
I mean, I-I’m not an actor.

32:00.503 --> 32:02.619
But if you really need us—

[ Beeping ]
Hey, results.

32:05.758 --> 32:10.092
Hey, it wasn’t glass.
It’s aluminosilicate.
What’s that?

32:10.179 --> 32:14.388
Aluminosilicate is used
to make the screens
for smartphones.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.771
Thanks, Cam.
I’ll tell Booth.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.311
Here you go. Mmm!

32:21.398 --> 32:24.060
You are eating
an excessive amount
of doughnuts on this trip.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.528
These are—
These are amazing doughnuts.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.945
They’re from this place
called Huckleberry’s.
Never had ’em before.

32:30.032 --> 32:31.863
It’s probably one
of the best doughnuts
I’ve ever had. Ever.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.903
Are you done?
Yeah.

32:33.994 --> 32:37.202
[ Brennan ]
Cam says it seems like
the victim’s hand...

32:37.289 --> 32:39.871
slammed into a cell phone
when he was run over.

32:39.959 --> 32:43.326
We already have
the victim’s cell phone.
Maybe he’s got two phones.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.796
The backup server.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.917
If Stephens used it
for one phone,
maybe he used it for both.

32:48.008 --> 32:50.795
Just make sure
Angela has all the accounts
to all the cell phones.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.293
Okay?
Sure.

32:52.388 --> 32:54.344
[ Booth ]
Now you really should have
a bite of this doughnut.

32:54.431 --> 32:56.092
So, they were right.

32:56.183 --> 32:59.300
Stephens did have
a personal phone
as well as a business phone.

32:59.395 --> 33:02.228
Now I’m still
downloading the backup
from last Friday night...

33:02.314 --> 33:04.691
and all I’ve got
are some texts, but look.

33:04.775 --> 33:07.938
[ Saroyan ]
“I’m aching for you.
Need it soon.”

33:08.028 --> 33:09.814
No wonder movie dialogue
is so bad.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.736
Yeah. He sent that
to Cherie Redfern.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.109
Look at her reply.

33:19.748 --> 33:22.535

so we need to get a projector.

No.
What did you
justsay?

33:23.961 --> 33:26.577
Cam. Nothing. Hi.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.503
Oh, my God.

33:28.591 --> 33:31.207
I was hoping
that Barry wouldn’t remember.
You have to destroy that.

33:31.302 --> 33:33.384
No,no,no,no.
This is the only copy.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.046
Look, I was about
to start med school,

33:37.141 --> 33:38.722
and I needed the money.

33:38.809 --> 33:40.595
And |— Oh, my God.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.302
I have never been
this mortified in my life.

33:45.441 --> 33:47.227
Cam, you might
wanna look at this.

33:49.445 --> 33:51.106
Wow.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.979
Stephens took some video
with his phone...

33:54.074 --> 33:55.655
on the same night he died,
apparently.

33:55.743 --> 33:57.699
That’s Cherie Redfern’s
trailer.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.448
Yeah, and that’s Jocco Kent,
the director.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.700
So Stephens
was spying on them.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.827

he had good reason to.

Nobody asks us any questions,
if you catch my meaning.

34:16.597 --> 34:18.007
Right.

34:18.098 --> 34:19.929

you’ve ever had?

is make some magic.

Little bit of magic
in an othenNise
sad and cruel world.

- Why is that so difficult?
- Why? Because someone
has been murdered.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.865
And now my film’s
being murdered.
How’s that fair?

35:35.509 --> 35:37.795
No. I didn’t even know
he was there.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.626
I thought I heard something,
and then—

35:39.722 --> 35:42.008
Are you telling me
Cherie was sleeping with him?

35:42.099 --> 35:44.181
You really thought
you were the only one?

You drive an MG,
don’t you, Mr. Kent?

35:46.228 --> 35:49.140
Yeah. ’65. Why?

35:49.231 --> 35:52.564
Because it’s a small car,
and Stephens was run over
by a small car.

35:52.651 --> 35:53.982
We’re gonna have
to examine your car.

35:54.069 --> 35:57.152
Are you sure
she was sleeping with Stephens?

35:57.239 --> 36:03.109
Throughout history, creative
people have commonly indulged
in a highly sensual lifestyle.

36:03.203 --> 36:04.864
It’s called
the artistic temperament.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.911

to have any other

There was something else
about that night.

telling us that now?

crazy Brit in Hollywood.

36:37.112 --> 36:39.444
I’m telling you.

36:39.573 --> 36:43.316
The vehicle was executing a turn
when it ran over the vict/m.
Right.

36:43.410 --> 36:46.652
I guess the killer would’ve
had to turn so he didn’t run
into the bungalow.

36:46.747 --> 36:48.453
You know, if! highlight
the bone damage,

36:56.173 --> 36:59.131
Could either the Mini
or the MG have done this?

36:59.218 --> 37:00.924
I’ll pull up the specs.

37:05.349 --> 37:09.638
No. Whatever ran him over had
an even smaller turning radius.

37:09.728 --> 37:13.687
ill have studio security
run a list of the vehicles
that came on the lot on Friday.

37:13.774 --> 37:15.514
Okay. And I’ll do
some more calculations...

37:15.609 --> 37:19.397
and see if! can come up
with a precise width
of the vehicle’s wheel track.

37:23.659 --> 37:26.071
The trunk of the elephant
has been grafted back on.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.277
Stephens must’ve ripped
the elephant trunk off...

37:28.372 --> 37:31.330
so he could look into, uh,
Cherie’s trailer there, huh?

37:31.417 --> 37:34.784
[ Clears Throat]
These leaves
are the Laurus nobi/is.

37:34.878 --> 37:37.085
That would explain the leaves
that were found on his suit.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.788
Since the cambium layers
look like they never dried,

37:39.883 --> 37:42.499
I would estimate
that these branches
were sealed together...

37:42.594 --> 37:44.380
within an hour
of being severed.

that Hanson Stephens was killed.

This cart is exactly
the right size.
Get away from that.

38:01.572 --> 38:05.565
The turning radius,
it’s small enough
to cause the fracturing I saw.

38:05.659 --> 38:08.901
Looks like Picasso’s upset
that someone’s messing
with her artwork.

- You saw Stephens—

38:11.498 --> 38:14.581
tearing the trunk off this elephant,
didn’t you?

down the drain.

beneath the front bumper.

You go after him. He takes off.
You get in the cart
and you run him down.

The blood and the cart
tie you to the murder.

wouldn’t even apologize.

for yelling at him.
