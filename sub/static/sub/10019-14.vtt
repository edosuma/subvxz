00:12.651 --> 00:13.666
Knock, knock.

00:13.899 --> 00:15.044
Who's there?

00:15.274 --> 00:17.925
- Me. You want some company?
- Sure.

00:24.298 --> 00:25.890
Nick! Nick!

00:26.120 --> 00:27.298
Get out of here, Nick.

00:27.529 --> 00:30.246
- Sorry about this. Nick, come on.
- That's okay.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.868
- Sorry. I'll be right back.
- It's okay.

00:35.304 --> 00:37.125
Hey, get out of here!

00:39.558 --> 00:41.532
<i>Please leave a message at the tone.</i>

00:42.501 --> 00:45.468
Hey, sweet pea.
Out of bed, sleepyhead!

00:46.852 --> 00:48.194
Hi, Polly.

00:48.741 --> 00:51.041
No, no.
I was just about to call you.

00:51.683 --> 00:53.057
Dinner tonight?

00:53.444 --> 00:55.419
Yeah, that sounds great. About 8?

00:56.226 --> 00:58.430
Mark, you ran out of shampoo.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.414
Yeah. It's on the shelf.

01:02.178 --> 01:03.323
I gotta go.

01:03.682 --> 01:04.543
Bye-bye.

01:08.833 --> 01:09.847
Who was that?

01:10.080 --> 01:11.486
That was a doctor.

01:11.712 --> 01:13.654
We got a staff meeting tonight.

01:13.888 --> 01:15.317
We have basketball tickets.

01:15.552 --> 01:18.682
- I thought that was tomorrow night.
- No, it's tonight.

01:19.199 --> 01:20.376
Remember?

01:21.085 --> 01:22.295
But, you know...

01:22.590 --> 01:24.412
...if you really can't make it...

01:24.606 --> 01:26.939
I think I can postpone.

01:30.365 --> 01:31.476
<i>What have you got?</i>

01:31.707 --> 01:34.326
City bus vs. Drunk pedestrian.
Fractured pelvis...

01:34.556 --> 01:36.245
...abdominal trauma.
Want to take this?

01:36.475 --> 01:38.133
Lavage is positive.
Start with an ex-lap.

01:38.362 --> 01:39.824
I haven't got your paperwork. Go.

01:40.059 --> 01:42.261
- Benton said he'd do it.
- It hasn't arrived yet.

01:42.490 --> 01:43.864
- It's on its way.
- You can't...

01:44.089 --> 01:47.023
...begin a new rotation until
he's signed off on the last one.

01:47.256 --> 01:48.184
What do I do?

01:48.408 --> 01:50.034
Until I get your evaluation, nothing.

01:50.265 --> 01:51.922
- Dr. Hicks, please.
- Find Benton.

01:52.151 --> 01:54.998
Get your paperwork.
Until then, you're grounded.

01:58.295 --> 01:59.821
- Malik, let it go.
- Come on, man!

02:00.054 --> 02:02.509
- You was out of control.
- It was offensive.

02:02.742 --> 02:06.352
- You charged.
- Lf I'm up in the air, I need room.

02:06.581 --> 02:08.205
So you're saying
you get up so high...

02:08.436 --> 02:10.858
...that I have to slide
right up under you.

02:11.988 --> 02:14.224
- So white man can jump.
- That's right.

02:14.451 --> 02:17.352
- They just can't land.
- That's why we don't do it.

02:17.586 --> 02:20.750
- Oh, man. You want me to carry you?
- Leave me alone.

02:25.170 --> 02:26.314
Hey, Kerry.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.364
Doug, that's not funny.

02:28.561 --> 02:30.186
I sprained my ankle.

02:30.416 --> 02:31.561
We got a kid choking!

02:31.792 --> 02:32.937
- On what?
- I don't know.

02:33.167 --> 02:35.687
- How long ago?
- About 10 minutes ago.

02:35.919 --> 02:38.340
- He's not breathing. Go, go, go.
- Let's go.

02:41.070 --> 02:42.793
Take care of the dad, please.

02:43.021 --> 02:47.275
McGill forceps. Someone
call Respiratory. Set up a vent.

02:48.013 --> 02:49.190
Let me borrow this.

02:49.612 --> 02:52.645
- Take 500 cc's saline on a Buretrol.
- Come on. He'll be all right.

02:56.011 --> 02:57.636
Get him on a monitor.

02:58.954 --> 02:59.685
What's in there?

03:00.747 --> 03:03.113
Looks like a jacks ball.

03:03.497 --> 03:04.839
Pulse ox is 80.

03:05.065 --> 03:06.919
- He's cyanotic.
- Can you reach it?

03:07.144 --> 03:08.551
No, it's wedged in there.

03:09.288 --> 03:10.303
He's in V-tach.

03:10.537 --> 03:13.285
- Get him 15 of lidocaine.
- I'll shock him.

03:15.879 --> 03:18.017
- Keep the lidocaine onboard.
- Clear.

03:18.246 --> 03:19.588
- Everybody off.
- Clear!

03:20.966 --> 03:22.972
- Still in V-tach.
- Again. Here we go.

03:23.205 --> 03:24.514
Clear.

03:25.798 --> 03:26.561
Here we go.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.446
Prep for a trach.

03:28.773 --> 03:31.107
Get me a 16-gauge needle
on a syringe.

03:31.332 --> 03:33.241
- Trach kit.
- Hang on just one second.

03:33.763 --> 03:35.105
Let me try this.

03:36.291 --> 03:37.054
Trach tray!

03:37.794 --> 03:38.776
What are you doing?

03:40.162 --> 03:42.747
I'm trying to boost the jack ball up.

03:43.585 --> 03:45.821
- I can feel it.
- This kid needs an airway.

03:46.849 --> 03:47.830
Get the forceps.

03:48.064 --> 03:49.471
I've got a line.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.521
I can feel the ball.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.014
It's moving.

03:58.590 --> 04:00.117
I almost got it.

04:00.959 --> 04:02.135
Did you get it?

04:07.196 --> 04:09.084
- I got it.
- All right, good!

04:11.005 --> 04:12.019
Pede's on their way.

04:12.507 --> 04:13.336
Is he breathing?

04:17.178 --> 04:18.584
Yep, he's breathing.

04:19.418 --> 04:22.101
What on earth made you
think to do that?

04:26.073 --> 04:27.828
- Peter!
- Yeah, yeah.

04:32.344 --> 04:34.863
I've been calling for days.
Where you been?

04:35.127 --> 04:36.142
Been busy.

04:36.375 --> 04:39.243
- This place is a mess.
- I've been working long hours.

04:39.510 --> 04:40.404
You feeling all right?

04:40.663 --> 04:43.661
- I'm just a little tired, is all.
- You look terrible.

04:45.237 --> 04:49.295
I saw Carla yesterday.
She's put on weight. You notice?

04:51.988 --> 04:53.132
She's pregnant.

04:57.906 --> 05:00.142
How could you be so stupid?

05:01.970 --> 05:03.530
Are you gonna marry her?

05:04.753 --> 05:05.582
I don't know.

05:05.874 --> 05:07.815
Be a father to your child?

05:08.336 --> 05:09.449
She's not good enough for you?

05:09.713 --> 05:11.535
- I didn't say that.
- What's the problem?

05:12.144 --> 05:13.768
Don't walk away from me.

05:13.999 --> 05:15.788
Hey, look.

05:18.510 --> 05:21.095
You don't have to do this alone.
You've got family.

05:21.454 --> 05:22.882
People who care for you.

05:23.117 --> 05:24.939
Look, Jackie, I know.

05:25.709 --> 05:27.531
I'll handle it.
I'll take care of it.

05:28.012 --> 05:28.841
How?

05:29.068 --> 05:29.962
I don't know.

05:31.948 --> 05:33.921
I gotta get dressed for work.

05:44.041 --> 05:44.935
Damn.

06:35.391 --> 06:36.984
- When do you get off the cane?
- A week.

06:37.215 --> 06:39.286
How'd you get two dates
on the same night?

06:39.518 --> 06:41.853
Scheduling mix-up.
Any suggestions?

06:42.078 --> 06:43.833
Dinner with one,
drinks with the other.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.330
I think they're both
expecting the works.

06:46.557 --> 06:47.986
Who do you like more?

06:48.253 --> 06:50.674
- Well, Heather's a lot of fun.
- Fun's good.

06:50.908 --> 06:53.242
Polly, she's very spiritual.

06:53.468 --> 06:55.802
Spiritual like what?
Like crystals or something?

06:56.027 --> 06:59.409
- Heather's got Bulls tickets.
- Bulls! Say no more.

06:59.866 --> 07:01.721
Yeah, you're right.
I'll call Polly.

07:01.946 --> 07:04.247
I'll make up an excuse
and go out with her tomorrow.

07:04.473 --> 07:05.967
You're playing with fire here.

07:06.201 --> 07:07.184
I can juggle.

07:07.418 --> 07:08.878
Women can smell deceit.

07:09.112 --> 07:10.006
You ought to know.

07:10.232 --> 07:12.207
Those days are long gone, my friend.

07:12.472 --> 07:13.965
So what do you do now?

07:14.231 --> 07:15.726
Give advice.

07:16.663 --> 07:19.312
- The form was very confusing.
- Evidently.

07:19.542 --> 07:20.469
What's going on?

07:20.726 --> 07:22.995
Haleh's playing nurse manager
while Carol's away.

07:23.222 --> 07:26.069
I ordered 12 emesis basins.

07:26.357 --> 07:27.535
She ordered 12 gross.

07:27.765 --> 07:29.073
Anybody seen our paychecks?

07:29.300 --> 07:32.147
- Ask your friendly nurse manager.
- They always come in by noon.

07:32.373 --> 07:34.859
Hey, did you guys see this memo
from Dr. Fischer?

07:35.091 --> 07:38.059
He wants to swab and culture
everyone for resistant staph.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.238
What's this about?

07:39.474 --> 07:42.027
Eight patients got staph.
They think we're spreading it.

07:42.258 --> 07:45.869
- Any idea who?
- Could be anyone. You, me...

07:46.801 --> 07:49.255
Jerry, get these boxes out of here.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.054
You haven't filled this out.

07:54.287 --> 07:56.197
The evaluation I need to transfer.

07:56.431 --> 07:58.154
- Put it in my box.
- I can't operate.

07:58.383 --> 08:00.487
- Leave it in my box.
- No. Do it now.

08:09.836 --> 08:11.724
"Satisfactory work"?

08:11.980 --> 08:13.540
Thanks for your time.

08:17.035 --> 08:18.442
- What is it?
- 28-year-old female.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.258
Multiple stab wounds
to the chest, arm.

08:20.490 --> 08:21.253
This is my case!

08:21.482 --> 08:23.107
- Looks surgical.
- I'll page you.

08:23.338 --> 08:24.385
There's plenty for everyone.

08:24.617 --> 08:28.414
Superficial lacerations.
Deep, penetrating wounds.

08:28.649 --> 08:29.760
I'll get the bloods.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.099
Spin the crit.

08:34.855 --> 08:36.261
Sounds like a pneumo.

08:36.486 --> 08:38.145
- Chest-tube tray.
- I need a tray too.

08:38.375 --> 08:39.583
Why don't you work together?

08:39.813 --> 08:40.926
Doyle can suture.

08:41.158 --> 08:43.013
You first. Give Carter 4.0 nylon.

08:43.238 --> 08:44.449
Who'll put the tube in?

08:44.677 --> 08:45.440
I will.

08:45.669 --> 08:47.164
Trouble in the sandbox?

08:47.397 --> 08:49.185
I'd like to put in a chest tube.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.811
Surgery's always
hogging our procedures.

08:52.228 --> 08:54.170
I agree. Dr. Doyle, you do it.

08:54.436 --> 08:56.606
But I've got more experience, right?
Dr. Benton?

08:56.835 --> 08:58.242
Ask Dr. Hicks.

08:58.499 --> 08:59.612
Well, you're in luck.

08:59.842 --> 09:02.809
She has bilateral pneumothoraces.
You can each put one in.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.797
- I'll take this side.
- Fine.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.639
- Sorry.
- Peter, are you okay?

09:10.656 --> 09:14.039
I like to make a subcutaneous tunnel
to avoid an air leak.

09:14.272 --> 09:16.093
That's nice.
Where'd you learn that?

09:16.927 --> 09:17.691
I don't remember.

09:17.919 --> 09:18.846
Kerry, you got this?

09:20.958 --> 09:22.267
Are you sure you're okay?

09:22.494 --> 09:24.021
Just a little indigestion.

09:24.254 --> 09:26.642
Try to avoid hitting
the intercostal bundle.

09:26.909 --> 09:29.080
- It's a common intern mistake.
- For surgical interns.

09:29.309 --> 09:30.617
Mine's in!

09:31.260 --> 09:32.787
How're you doing over there?

09:37.083 --> 09:38.643
This says that 40% of doctors...

09:38.875 --> 09:40.630
...don't wash their hands
between patients.

09:40.858 --> 09:41.654
No kidding.

09:41.882 --> 09:45.013
And medical personnel pick
their noses three times an hour.

09:45.241 --> 09:48.885
- Many interns bathe twice a week...
- I don't want to be that well-informed.

09:49.113 --> 09:51.185
Doug, we've got a sick kid out front.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.594
All right.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.124
Nice technique.

09:58.391 --> 10:00.724
Could I interest you
in some detective work?

10:00.982 --> 10:03.568
I'm tracking the culprit
that's been spreading the staph.

10:03.798 --> 10:04.561
Good luck.

10:04.790 --> 10:06.196
I could really use your help.

10:06.421 --> 10:10.250
It's not an attractive proposition.
We both know where staph comes from.

10:11.924 --> 10:14.029
Not washing their hands
after using the bathroom.

10:14.420 --> 10:15.794
How will you flush them out?

10:16.115 --> 10:17.227
Carefully.

10:18.195 --> 10:19.755
Very carefully.

10:23.314 --> 10:25.202
He can't breathe.
He's got cystic fibrosis.

10:25.457 --> 10:26.384
- His name?
- Jad Heuston.

10:26.641 --> 10:29.063
Jad, hang in there.
We're gonna fix you right up.

10:29.297 --> 10:30.506
- What's your name?
- Katy Reed.

10:30.736 --> 10:33.103
- How old is he?
- He's 19.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.174
- Has he been here before?
- No. We live in Racine.

10:36.399 --> 10:38.538
- What were you doing here?
- We were visiting.

10:38.767 --> 10:40.806
A kid this sick
shouldn't be traveling.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.841
Get me a CBC, portable chest
and O-2. Ten liters, please.

10:45.070 --> 10:46.629
Pulse ox is bad. 82.

10:46.860 --> 10:47.656
He's coughing up blood!

10:47.885 --> 10:50.089
He's got rales
and he's breathing bilaterally.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.810
- Bronchodilator?
- Yeah.

10:52.044 --> 10:55.622
Give me 5 mgs of nebulized albuterol
and 200 of aerosolized tobramycin.

10:55.851 --> 10:58.153
Pulse ox is down to 78.
Heart rate's 130.

10:58.411 --> 10:59.207
Let's intubate him.

11:00.554 --> 11:02.528
- We can't wait.
- He doesn't want to.

11:02.794 --> 11:04.354
- Does he have a DNR order?
- I think so.

11:04.874 --> 11:05.888
Yes, he does.

11:06.121 --> 11:07.779
If he's DNR, we can't tube him.

11:08.009 --> 11:09.285
He'll die if we don't tube him.

11:10.665 --> 11:11.427
Jad, please.

11:13.383 --> 11:14.660
Please don't leave me.

11:15.016 --> 11:15.876
Who's his doctor?

11:16.295 --> 11:17.637
Dobry. Something like that.

11:17.863 --> 11:20.132
Lydia, will you call
Dr. Dobry in Racine?

11:20.358 --> 11:22.943
Call about the DNR order.
Find out now, please.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.795
One, two, three.

11:25.542 --> 11:27.930
- Mr. Papillion?
- One. Yes? Three.

11:28.197 --> 11:29.658
One, two, three.

11:29.925 --> 11:32.477
- I'm Dr. Greene. What's the problem?
- Busy.

11:33.284 --> 11:35.619
- Page Psych?
- On the way.

11:39.971 --> 11:42.904
Would you like me to give you
something to relax?

11:43.554 --> 11:46.367
- Got any other ideas?
- Well, I'm thinking.

11:47.649 --> 11:49.307
Hey, Archie.

11:50.593 --> 11:51.355
Psych consult?

11:51.584 --> 11:54.071
You stopped taking your medication,
didn't you?

11:57.951 --> 11:59.096
Nina Pomerantz.

11:59.647 --> 12:00.694
Mark Greene.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.235
He's one of our regulars.

12:02.558 --> 12:03.899
Archie, snap it!

12:07.581 --> 12:08.345
Thanks.

12:08.573 --> 12:10.744
- That's amazing.
- Basic behavior therapy.

12:10.972 --> 12:13.360
- Would it work on my daughter?
- What's her problem?

12:13.755 --> 12:16.754
She started sucking her thumb
when my wife and I got divorced.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.158
My 6-year-old wet the bed
when I got divorced.

12:19.387 --> 12:20.631
You used behavioral therapy?

12:20.859 --> 12:22.963
No. Electroshock.
Works like a charm.

12:26.809 --> 12:28.696
Kidding! I'm just kidding.

12:28.921 --> 12:31.767
- I hate to interrupt.
- Oh, yeah. Let's go upstairs and talk.

12:31.991 --> 12:33.486
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

12:41.463 --> 12:42.956
- We're losing him.
- Any word on the DNR?

12:43.190 --> 12:45.808
- Not yet.
- Found some weed in his socks.

12:46.037 --> 12:47.280
He's smoking dope with CF?

12:47.509 --> 12:48.491
Must be a death wish.

12:48.725 --> 12:51.278
They're paging Dr. Dobry.
He's a pediatrician.

12:54.388 --> 12:55.500
How old is he?

12:55.731 --> 12:56.778
I told you, he's 19.

12:57.011 --> 12:59.378
19-year-olds don't go
to a pediatrician. How old?

13:04.082 --> 13:05.259
He's 17.

13:05.522 --> 13:06.285
ET tube!

13:06.514 --> 13:07.341
He's crashing!

13:07.569 --> 13:08.681
Should we restrain him?

13:08.945 --> 13:11.312
Yeah. Give him sux and Pav.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.327
I'm tubing him.

13:16.624 --> 13:17.735
Move his head.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.197
I'm sorry, Jad.

13:26.286 --> 13:29.580
It hit me really suddenly,
so I'm gonna have to cancel.

13:29.805 --> 13:31.049
- Bless you.
- He's not sick.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.098
He's blowing off a date.

13:34.412 --> 13:37.760
I'm gonna get to bed early.
So I'll call you tomorrow?

13:38.411 --> 13:39.393
Bye, Pol.

13:39.851 --> 13:41.509
- What's wrong with Polly?
- Don't start.

13:41.739 --> 13:44.738
- He had to make room for Heather.
- So you got two on the line?

13:44.970 --> 13:46.180
Hi, Mark.

13:47.273 --> 13:48.679
I forgot Mr. Papillion's chart.

13:48.905 --> 13:52.384
That's a coincidence
because I have it right here.

13:52.615 --> 13:55.299
A Freudian might say
I forgot it on purpose.

13:56.776 --> 14:00.190
I was supposed to have dinner
with a colleague and they canceled.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.073
- Are you free?
- I'd love to. I'm all jammed up.

14:04.326 --> 14:05.471
But I'd really like to.

14:05.894 --> 14:08.577
Well, it's just an impulse.
Probably another time.

14:08.836 --> 14:10.778
Great impulse.
I'm having dinner with a friend.

14:11.012 --> 14:13.728
My accountant, Roy.
But we could do drinks.

14:13.956 --> 14:16.257
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Meet down here at 6?

14:16.484 --> 14:17.377
I'll see you then.

14:17.635 --> 14:19.009
All right. Good.

14:24.066 --> 14:27.295
- Jerry, can we lose these boxes?
- Busy boy.

14:28.321 --> 14:31.071
Pulse ox is up to 94.
Prep for an extubation?

14:31.553 --> 14:33.046
Mother's out front.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.247
She'd have been here sooner,
but her car was stolen.

14:36.480 --> 14:39.413
The one that's outside.
You want to fill me in?

14:40.094 --> 14:41.436
We were going to Mexico.

14:41.695 --> 14:45.076
We were gonna get a beach place
and be together until the end.

14:46.206 --> 14:48.442
The doctors gave him three months.

14:48.732 --> 14:50.106
Why can't you be together here?

14:50.333 --> 14:53.049
His mom wants to put him
in the hospital.

14:54.076 --> 14:54.904
Is he all right?

14:55.132 --> 14:57.074
His airway was blocked,
but we got it cleared.

14:57.308 --> 14:58.387
Thank God!

14:58.619 --> 15:00.921
Sweetheart, I was so worried.

15:01.499 --> 15:04.432
Katy, I knew you'd be here.
Are you trying to kill him?

15:04.666 --> 15:06.324
He'd rather be dead than be with you.

15:06.617 --> 15:08.755
Katy, would you give us
a minute, please?

15:14.007 --> 15:15.568
He wants me to stay.

15:16.696 --> 15:18.255
- Can we talk over here?
- Yes.

15:20.247 --> 15:23.410
- I was taking the tube out.
- Already?

15:23.638 --> 15:26.769
Well, his lungs are fairly clear
and he wanted it out.

15:26.998 --> 15:29.036
Listen, he didn't want
to be intubated.

15:29.269 --> 15:31.472
He said he had
a "do not resuscitate" order?

15:31.701 --> 15:32.594
He lied.

15:32.821 --> 15:34.194
Look, he has this...

15:34.867 --> 15:36.656
...romantic notion about dying.

15:37.204 --> 15:40.334
I just needed to know that
if he stops breathing again...

15:40.722 --> 15:41.770
Intubate him.

15:46.289 --> 15:47.664
All right, Jad.

15:48.912 --> 15:51.051
Let me get this tube out for you.

15:51.536 --> 15:53.543
Now, I want you to do me a favor.

15:53.776 --> 15:56.525
I want you to take a deep breath.
As deep as you can.

15:56.752 --> 15:59.401
Now blow hard.
Blow, blow, blow!

16:07.630 --> 16:10.728
Don't ever tube me again.

16:16.235 --> 16:19.082
- Why are you taking our picture?
- To keep track of the suspects.

16:19.274 --> 16:20.681
- Two swabs?
- Nasal and rectal.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.752
- We need them back by 3.
- God, I feel like a convict!

16:23.977 --> 16:25.155
The number matches your lab slip.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.978
I hope the doctors
get the same treatment.

16:27.209 --> 16:30.023
They have to swab too.
Staphylococcus does not discriminate.

16:30.376 --> 16:31.140
Smile, Wendy.

16:33.449 --> 16:34.877
Give me the bullet.

16:35.112 --> 16:37.959
Twenty-three-year-old IV drug user.
Multiple GSWs.

16:38.184 --> 16:40.965
BP, 80 palp. Pulse, 140.
Lost a liter at the scene.

16:41.254 --> 16:43.010
His buddy says he's got AIDS.

16:43.239 --> 16:44.961
Let's type and cross-match for six.

16:45.189 --> 16:46.978
- Get some O-neg here.
- Taken care of.

16:48.486 --> 16:50.011
- I can run this one.
- So can I.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.349
I'll run it.
We'll start with the ABCs.

16:52.581 --> 16:55.230
- He's breathing from his mouth.
- Pressure's falling.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.314
- Got the O-neg.
- Run it through the transfuser.

16:57.923 --> 16:58.816
Intubation tray.

16:59.043 --> 17:00.537
He may have a hemopneumo.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.527
- You need help, Dr. Doyle?
- No.

17:02.754 --> 17:04.892
- I got the film.
- Clamp!

17:05.826 --> 17:06.589
Don't touch it!

17:06.817 --> 17:07.613
- What?
- The bullet.

17:08.354 --> 17:11.036
Where you were about to stick
your finger. He has AIDS.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.979
It's a Black Talon.
The edges are like razors.

17:15.359 --> 17:16.733
I'll never find this thing.

17:19.294 --> 17:21.531
Oh, I don't believe it.
It's right...

17:22.781 --> 17:24.820
- Yeah, I got it.
- He's arrested!

17:25.117 --> 17:25.881
Let's crack him.

17:26.204 --> 17:27.699
Want to do the honors?

17:29.948 --> 17:31.704
Second unit's in.

17:33.020 --> 17:35.954
- Anyone seen a nursing schedule?
- You were in charge of it.

17:36.188 --> 17:39.635
I better have this weekend off.
I've got National Guard duty.

17:39.867 --> 17:42.867
- God help us.
- Has anybody seen the ultrasound?

17:43.099 --> 17:46.131
Everything's disorganized without
Carol. I would try Exam 2.

17:46.361 --> 17:47.736
When's she coming back?

17:47.962 --> 17:50.165
We just hope she is coming back.

17:50.681 --> 17:52.339
We need some plasma.

17:52.601 --> 17:54.194
Suction!
She can't see a thing here!

17:54.455 --> 17:56.877
- Bullet must have nicked an artery.
- Satinsky.

17:57.111 --> 17:58.900
Intracardiac epi and calcium ready.

18:00.758 --> 18:02.165
This is jammed.
I can't use it.

18:02.422 --> 18:03.437
I'll find another one.

18:03.671 --> 18:05.775
Put pressure on the lungs.
Do compressions.

18:06.165 --> 18:08.053
- I'm squeezing.
- No. That's me.

18:08.277 --> 18:09.106
Sorry. I got it.

18:09.333 --> 18:13.042
Good job, you two. Now, can you
hold on while we take him upstairs?

18:13.621 --> 18:14.929
- Yeah.
- Sure.

18:15.155 --> 18:15.919
Can I assist?

18:16.244 --> 18:18.251
- Your paperwork done?
- Signed and in your box.

18:18.483 --> 18:21.711
Let's get him to the O.R., people.
Come on, let's go!

18:22.195 --> 18:22.958
Look out.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.746
What's the ultrasound doing in there?

18:25.009 --> 18:27.759
I don't know. But that CF kid
wants to talk to an Attending.

18:27.954 --> 18:29.643
All right, I'll be right there.

18:33.040 --> 18:33.968
Peter.

18:34.607 --> 18:36.331
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.429
It must be something.
When did the pains start?

18:39.662 --> 18:41.124
- Last night.
- Location?

18:41.359 --> 18:44.903
Midepigastric. Shifted to the
right lower quadrant this morning.

18:45.134 --> 18:45.897
Fever?

18:46.189 --> 18:47.018
100.2.

18:47.245 --> 18:48.009
Lie down.

18:48.237 --> 18:49.644
It's probably just a virus.

18:49.868 --> 18:50.981
Lie down.

18:51.212 --> 18:52.160
Lydia, can you assist?

18:54.477 --> 18:55.239
Dr. Benton?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.409
Just relax, Peter.

19:02.250 --> 19:04.454
Sorry. Alert the O.R.

19:04.683 --> 19:07.202
Dr. Benton has a hot appendix.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.321
Is it true what they say about...?

19:31.332 --> 19:33.339
Hey, have you guys seen Doug?

19:33.796 --> 19:35.420
Try the Admit desk.

19:36.899 --> 19:37.663
What?

19:38.051 --> 19:38.945
Nothing.

19:46.466 --> 19:47.895
Hey, Doug. You busy?

19:48.257 --> 19:51.802
What's the recommended antibiotics
for end-stage cystic fibrosis?

19:52.032 --> 19:55.926
I'm sorry. So I took your advice,
and I canceled with Polly.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.916
- Good.
- And then I met Nina.

19:58.144 --> 20:00.761
Now it's drinks with Nina,
then basketball with Heather.

20:01.023 --> 20:01.754
Great.

20:02.014 --> 20:04.502
Should I have Heather
meet me at the stadium?

20:04.734 --> 20:06.424
I could spend more time with Nina.

20:06.653 --> 20:08.825
I'm busy with a sick kid.
Can we talk later?

20:09.054 --> 20:11.387
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
I'll catch you later.

20:11.868 --> 20:12.948
Hey, Mark.

20:14.268 --> 20:17.398
That's a tough case.
You know, that kid with end-stage CF.

20:17.627 --> 20:20.442
If he had a jacks ball in his throat,
maybe I could fix it.

20:21.562 --> 20:23.504
You know he wants to be made DNR.

20:24.859 --> 20:26.865
- You talked to him?
- Yes.

20:27.865 --> 20:28.793
He's my patient.

20:29.017 --> 20:31.951
He spoke to me. Maybe
you haven't been listening to him.

20:32.216 --> 20:33.874
He's 17.
It's his mother's decision.

20:34.136 --> 20:35.543
He'll be 18 in three weeks.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.386
So maybe we should
consider his feelings.

20:38.615 --> 20:41.167
He's a teenager. He's mixed-up.
He ran away from home.

20:41.398 --> 20:43.503
He's terminally ill and
doesn't wanna be on a respirator.

20:43.734 --> 20:46.100
I can't go along with letting him die.

20:47.349 --> 20:50.578
Whose problem is this?
His or yours?

20:58.195 --> 20:59.886
Oh, my God! It's true.

21:00.179 --> 21:01.836
I thought the nurses were kidding.

21:02.066 --> 21:05.132
Dr. Hicks, I don't want any
residents operating on me, okay?

21:05.427 --> 21:09.070
Don't worry. It's just your average
run-of-the-mill appendectomy.

21:09.266 --> 21:12.079
- So you'll do it, right?
- I'll be there.

21:17.391 --> 21:18.853
I better go scrub.

21:19.087 --> 21:22.501
Sign this consent form.
Dr. Hicks'll answer any questions.

21:22.734 --> 21:23.978
That won't be necessary.

21:27.117 --> 21:30.216
All right. Come on.
Let's get this thing over with.

21:30.445 --> 21:33.095
Okay, time to prep.
Raise your gown.

21:40.779 --> 21:42.022
- It's a mystery.
- Doesn't add up.

21:42.251 --> 21:43.680
Here are the patients with staph.

21:43.946 --> 21:45.834
None were treated
by the same doctor.

21:46.091 --> 21:46.853
Where's the missing link?

21:47.081 --> 21:50.758
We could put cameras in the bathroom
to see who doesn't wash their hands.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.131
- Wait a minute.
- What?

21:56.648 --> 21:59.135
All these charts have
the same handwriting on top.

22:00.007 --> 22:00.836
You recognize it?

22:09.285 --> 22:11.902
Greg. Jeanie. Dr. Fischer.

22:12.132 --> 22:13.594
Can I offer you guys a brownie?

22:13.860 --> 22:14.788
No, thanks.

22:16.804 --> 22:18.178
What? Is something wrong?

22:22.658 --> 22:24.065
- What are you doing?
- Scrubbing in.

22:24.290 --> 22:26.744
Dr. Hicks said I could help out
on that thoracotomy.

22:26.977 --> 22:28.471
You're interested in surgery?

22:28.705 --> 22:30.909
I've been thinking about
doing an elective.

22:31.458 --> 22:34.010
Thank you again
for warning me about that bullet.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.607
My dad's a cop.
We talked ammo at the dinner table.

22:36.831 --> 22:37.594
Seriously?

22:37.824 --> 22:39.133
You should see my collection.

22:39.583 --> 22:42.397
I got a Beretta.687,
Winchester Golden Quail.

22:42.590 --> 22:45.143
And I got a Tommy gun
that belonged to Dillinger.

22:45.918 --> 22:47.411
Change in plans.

22:47.709 --> 22:49.913
Simon's got the gunshot.
We're doing the appy.

22:50.269 --> 22:51.163
The appy?

22:51.549 --> 22:52.344
Disappointed?

22:52.892 --> 22:54.266
Yeah, they're kind of boring.

22:54.780 --> 22:56.918
You haven't seen the patient yet.

23:07.578 --> 23:09.039
Oh, there is a God.

23:09.785 --> 23:12.151
What are my chances
of getting out of here?

23:12.408 --> 23:13.357
I can't say.

23:13.624 --> 23:15.348
Don't give me that crap.

23:16.152 --> 23:17.613
You still have some time.

23:17.879 --> 23:19.789
Three months, max.

23:20.631 --> 23:22.572
You could spend that time with Katy.

23:23.158 --> 23:25.908
Great. She can suction
the snot out of my lungs...

23:26.134 --> 23:28.042
...while I stare at the ceiling.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.773
I've been in hospitals my whole life.

23:31.605 --> 23:34.604
I watched two friends die
on a respirator...

23:35.220 --> 23:36.780
...slowly wasting away.

23:37.012 --> 23:38.189
No, thanks.

23:38.419 --> 23:39.597
It's not your decision.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.927
Oh, please.
I'll be 18 in three weeks.

23:43.826 --> 23:45.549
- Can't do it.
- Screw you!

23:47.665 --> 23:48.559
What about me?

23:51.409 --> 23:52.488
It's up to your mom.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.437
She's been telling me
what to do my whole life.

23:56.177 --> 23:58.542
For once, let me do what I want.

24:01.967 --> 24:04.584
You know, she's afraid of losing you.

24:05.998 --> 24:07.655
She's gonna lose me anyway.

24:10.957 --> 24:12.299
Talk to her.

24:13.388 --> 24:15.330
Tell her to let me go.

24:23.914 --> 24:25.440
Hey, look who it is!

24:26.794 --> 24:28.418
- Why are you here?
- Pick up my paycheck.

24:28.649 --> 24:29.631
Not here yet.

24:29.865 --> 24:31.589
Thanks for taking our side
against management.

24:31.817 --> 24:33.638
I guess you're paying for it.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.487
- Why are all these boxes here?
- Procurement screwed up.

24:36.712 --> 24:39.231
Oh. Some fool ordered
by the gross, huh?

24:39.623 --> 24:42.340
- Here's my paycheck.
- Any idea when you're coming back?

24:42.567 --> 24:44.835
No. The hearing's
in a few weeks though, so...

24:45.062 --> 24:46.011
We've missed you.

24:46.246 --> 24:47.228
Thanks.

24:47.462 --> 24:50.974
Well, I'm off to Pottery Barn.
Gonna go buy some candles. See you.

24:54.948 --> 24:56.803
Someone order some hypodermics?

25:02.946 --> 25:06.394
This is ridiculous.
I do not need hand-washing lessons.

25:06.626 --> 25:08.447
Scrub hard to scrape
off the bacteria.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.974
And wash your hands
after you go to the bathroom.

25:11.585 --> 25:12.567
What, every time?

25:17.824 --> 25:19.928
- You have the Roux retractor?
- Yes, Peter.

25:20.191 --> 25:22.646
And the Army-Navys and the Kocher.

25:22.879 --> 25:24.733
Listen, listen.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.997
Make sure you put
an "X" on my right side.

25:27.262 --> 25:29.399
I don't want you
taking out my left kidney.

25:30.173 --> 25:32.180
We're putting you to sleep now.

25:32.637 --> 25:34.262
Where's Dr. Hicks?

25:34.492 --> 25:37.492
There's been
a last-minute substitution.

25:39.419 --> 25:40.183
Carter?

25:41.275 --> 25:42.769
Don't worry, Dr. Benton.

25:43.003 --> 25:44.758
I'll take very good care of you.

25:49.593 --> 25:53.421
He hates me. I know he loves me,
but he also hates me.

25:53.976 --> 25:55.318
Is he an only child?

25:55.512 --> 25:59.253
After he was diagnosed,
we decided not to risk passing it on.

26:00.215 --> 26:02.768
I spoke to Jad.
He wants you to sign his DNR papers.

26:02.999 --> 26:04.624
Of course he does.

26:06.198 --> 26:08.499
He's got a pretty convincing argument.

26:09.269 --> 26:10.829
He just wants to hurt me.

26:11.061 --> 26:12.751
I don't think that's true.

26:13.205 --> 26:16.204
Shouldn't you give him a chance
to make this decision?

26:16.436 --> 26:17.745
He's almost 18 years old.

26:18.068 --> 26:20.784
He was a beautiful baby, Dr. Ross.

26:21.107 --> 26:23.594
When the doctors told us
that he had cystic fibrosis...

26:23.858 --> 26:26.476
...it was like somebody plunged
a knife into my heart.

26:26.706 --> 26:28.909
And now he's grown up.

26:29.137 --> 26:31.047
He wants to take control of his life...

26:31.312 --> 26:35.272
...and he doesn't want to die
hooked up to a respirator.

26:35.632 --> 26:37.126
And you agree with him.

26:39.471 --> 26:41.031
He doesn't have much time left.

26:41.263 --> 26:43.532
It seems a shame to spend it...

26:43.758 --> 26:45.383
...fighting with your son.

26:47.694 --> 26:49.481
I don't know what to do.

26:53.325 --> 26:54.818
Well, he does.

27:01.643 --> 27:02.919
How are we doing on the board?

27:03.147 --> 27:05.349
Actually, there's a
psychotic wrestler in 2.

27:05.578 --> 27:07.585
Want me to page
a certain Psych consult?

27:07.818 --> 27:09.191
That's an excellent idea.

27:09.417 --> 27:10.878
Hey, sweet pea!

27:12.553 --> 27:14.723
You poor thing.
Working while you're sick.

27:15.176 --> 27:17.281
Polly, I can't talk.
I've got laryngitis.

27:18.536 --> 27:21.764
Elderberry extract. It's homeopathic.
It cleared my flu right up.

27:21.991 --> 27:23.649
Thank you. Excuse me.

27:24.390 --> 27:25.535
Cancel that page.

27:27.589 --> 27:29.825
You should go.
I don't want you to catch it.

27:30.085 --> 27:33.860
Not until I make you an herbal steam
of lavender for your throat.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.282
Jerry, we'll be in the lounge.

27:39.044 --> 27:40.287
- Shirley?
- Yes, sir.

27:40.515 --> 27:43.417
- Would you put on my special music?
- Certainly, sir.

27:51.553 --> 27:52.316
Scalpel.

27:56.064 --> 27:57.209
Hold it, Dr. Carter.

27:57.599 --> 27:58.363
Shirley?

28:01.823 --> 28:02.619
Let's get this one.

28:09.022 --> 28:11.574
Let's get one with
Dr. Hicks and Dr. Doyle.

28:16.156 --> 28:17.400
What's your approach?

28:17.628 --> 28:20.016
I am going to make a minimal
Rocky-Davis incision...

28:20.251 --> 28:22.160
...in the right lower quadrant.

28:22.491 --> 28:23.255
Proceed.

28:33.049 --> 28:34.423
Come on, inhale.

28:36.856 --> 28:38.546
It won't work
unless you breathe it in.

28:38.776 --> 28:41.906
Excuse me, Dr. Greene.
Your psychiatrist is at the desk.

28:43.062 --> 28:44.437
I'll be right back.

28:45.174 --> 28:46.581
I told you to cancel.

28:46.805 --> 28:48.660
The page went through. I'm sorry.

28:50.453 --> 28:51.697
Did you page me?

28:51.925 --> 28:55.339
Yeah. We have a patient in 2
who needs evaluating.

28:55.572 --> 28:58.255
- I'm looking forward to this evening.
- Me too.

28:58.484 --> 29:02.279
Dr. Greene to the front desk, please.
Emergency at the front desk.

29:02.514 --> 29:04.041
- I'll see you at 7.
- Six.

29:04.275 --> 29:05.289
Right.

29:08.146 --> 29:11.047
My brother got us courtside seats.
I was so excited, I came by.

29:11.313 --> 29:12.076
Terrific.

29:12.305 --> 29:15.403
- We could get a bite before the game.
- I've got that meeting.

29:15.632 --> 29:16.526
Safety Committee?

29:16.752 --> 29:19.305
- Could I meet you at the stadium?
- How about afterwards?

29:19.535 --> 29:21.357
We should talk, but I'm swamped.

29:21.583 --> 29:23.885
That's okay.
I'll just have a seat.

29:24.399 --> 29:26.885
You know what?
You don't want to sit in there.

29:27.117 --> 29:29.539
There's this staph infection
that's going around.

29:29.774 --> 29:31.399
Why don't you sit over here?

29:31.629 --> 29:33.963
Yeah, yeah. This is fine.
I'll be right back.

29:35.243 --> 29:37.251
You really shouldn't be on your feet.

29:37.515 --> 29:41.256
Polly, why don't you go back
and keep that lavender steaming?

29:41.835 --> 29:42.663
Thanks.

29:44.042 --> 29:46.016
That is a very interesting case.

29:46.250 --> 29:48.672
He's diagnosed with
multiple personality disorder.

29:48.906 --> 29:50.847
- Really?
- Are you okay?

29:51.081 --> 29:51.942
Nina?

29:52.489 --> 29:53.765
Polly?

29:54.153 --> 29:55.875
I haven't seen you in a blue moon.

29:56.104 --> 29:57.511
You practiced at Northwestern?

29:57.736 --> 29:59.197
I did.
Are you at the gallery?

29:59.432 --> 30:00.773
I sure am.

30:00.999 --> 30:04.447
Mark, this is Polly MclKenzie.
My old friend, Polly, Mark Greene.

30:04.679 --> 30:07.099
I know.
Mark and I are seeing each other.

30:08.102 --> 30:11.101
We were supposed to have dinner
tonight, but he's got the flu.

30:13.317 --> 30:15.389
Funny. I thought
we were having drinks.

30:16.132 --> 30:20.026
Gee, was that drinks before
or after the basketball game?

30:21.699 --> 30:23.008
You're not sick.

30:23.971 --> 30:26.817
No, but I'm starting to feel
a little nauseous.

30:29.538 --> 30:30.944
- Did he spike a fever?
- 5 minutes ago.

30:31.168 --> 30:32.313
Get blood cultures.

30:32.545 --> 30:36.188
- I'll get the intubation tray.
- No. His mother signed a DNR order.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.046
How are you doing, buddy?

30:38.720 --> 30:39.800
Good.

30:40.926 --> 30:41.657
Remember...

30:41.919 --> 30:43.032
...doctor...

30:43.263 --> 30:44.572
Put an O-2 mask on him.

30:45.151 --> 30:46.328
Are you sure?

30:49.405 --> 30:50.616
- His mom?
- In the cafeteria.

30:50.846 --> 30:52.601
Get her now, will you? Go!

31:05.563 --> 31:06.991
Could you turn that down?

31:07.226 --> 31:07.989
Just a bit.

31:09.498 --> 31:10.927
I'm ready to close.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.022
Nice work.

31:12.409 --> 31:15.126
Thanks. Maybe I'll staple
my name into his belly.

31:17.528 --> 31:19.437
Let's irrigate one more time.

31:19.704 --> 31:21.678
We don't want to give
Dr. Benton an abscess.

31:21.911 --> 31:24.016
Dr. Doyle, you want
to suction out Dr. Benton?

31:24.247 --> 31:26.668
Can I have O-PDS on a CT-3?

31:27.734 --> 31:31.759
I'll close out with a running stitch.
You ever done a one-handed tie?

31:34.324 --> 31:37.553
I often practice on pigs' feet.

31:38.292 --> 31:40.048
But since Dr. Benton is available...

31:40.596 --> 31:43.911
Hold the suture in your left hand.
And don't let go.

31:44.178 --> 31:46.927
You take it between your thumb
and your forefinger...

31:47.442 --> 31:48.457
...around...

31:48.977 --> 31:50.155
...and through.

31:51.282 --> 31:52.808
Pretty nifty.

31:55.505 --> 31:56.878
Can Dr. Doyle try one?

31:57.744 --> 31:59.304
Dr. Benton wouldn't mind.

31:59.535 --> 32:01.901
After all, we are a teaching hospital.

32:06.094 --> 32:08.297
- Thanks.
- Thanks for all your help today.

32:08.654 --> 32:11.371
We make a good team.
Maybe we should go out again.

32:11.852 --> 32:13.314
- I don't think so.
- It'd be fun.

32:13.741 --> 32:15.683
- It's not a good idea.
- Come on. Dinner.

32:15.948 --> 32:17.224
Let's keep it professional.

32:21.355 --> 32:23.427
His pulse ox is falling. 83.

32:23.659 --> 32:25.601
- What happened?
- He's in respiratory failure.

32:26.602 --> 32:28.259
I'm here, sweetheart.

32:30.026 --> 32:31.041
Sweetie.

32:47.973 --> 32:50.395
- He's stopped breathing.
- Oh, my God!

32:50.630 --> 32:52.516
Oh, God. I can't watch this.

33:15.008 --> 33:16.667
- Intubate him.
- Yeah, please.

33:17.919 --> 33:19.032
No. We promised.

33:20.384 --> 33:21.660
- Mrs. Heuston...
- Do it!

33:21.888 --> 33:24.188
No, no, Mrs. Heuston.
You signed the paper.

33:24.415 --> 33:27.283
Well, then rip up the paper!
Just do it!

33:30.717 --> 33:31.895
I said, do it!

33:37.852 --> 33:38.899
Sorry.

33:39.132 --> 33:40.244
Intubation tray.

33:40.476 --> 33:41.621
Hold him down.

33:41.852 --> 33:45.167
Fifty of sux. We'll have
to paralyze him. Hold him down.

33:46.555 --> 33:48.725
Number 8 ET tube, please.

33:54.873 --> 33:56.247
Take it. Bag him.

33:57.656 --> 33:58.419
He's tubed.

34:12.245 --> 34:13.521
I feel like such a klutz.

34:13.748 --> 34:16.498
- Lots of people fall off stepladders.
- I fell over one.

34:16.724 --> 34:20.748
I was hanging a picture. I took
three steps back and landed on my ass.

34:20.978 --> 34:23.313
- You're lucky.
- I guess.

34:23.858 --> 34:26.444
- I bet you don't remember me, do you?
- Should I?

34:26.674 --> 34:29.639
I was in here about a year ago.
I weighed 40 pounds less.

34:30.385 --> 34:32.239
I had pneumonia and almost died.

34:32.496 --> 34:34.023
You took care of me.

34:35.312 --> 34:36.621
You have AIDS.

34:37.583 --> 34:39.819
I was set to die.
I said goodbye to everyone.

34:40.047 --> 34:42.186
I got rid of my stuff,
cashed in my life insurance.

34:42.512 --> 34:45.226
- Then everything changed.
- Really?

34:45.455 --> 34:47.080
You've heard of the cocktail?

34:47.406 --> 34:51.114
My doctor put me on it. I haven't
felt this good in a long time.

34:51.661 --> 34:52.489
That's great.

34:52.717 --> 34:56.775
It's weird. It's like I was
on death row, and the governor called.

34:57.548 --> 34:59.554
It takes a little getting used to...

34:59.819 --> 35:02.437
...but it is a hell of
a lot better than dying.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.524
Peter, I'm pregnant.

35:18.503 --> 35:20.030
I'm pregnant.

35:23.495 --> 35:24.477
Dr. Benton...

35:24.711 --> 35:26.085
...I'm pregnant.

35:38.852 --> 35:40.259
There we go.

35:40.931 --> 35:43.450
Your surgery was a complete success.

35:43.682 --> 35:46.617
You had an acute
suppurative appendicitis...

35:46.850 --> 35:48.671
...with no complications.

35:50.689 --> 35:52.096
Here's your appendix.

35:52.898 --> 35:55.614
Don't try and talk.
You're coming out of the anesthesia.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.749
I really screwed up.

35:58.401 --> 35:59.545
- I really did.
- You did?

36:00.287 --> 36:04.563
I never gave the kid a chance.
Carla, I'm so sorry.

36:04.798 --> 36:08.541
- I don't know what to do.
- No. It's me, Carter.

36:13.021 --> 36:13.784
What's going on?

36:15.677 --> 36:18.774
You're in the Recovery room.
I just took out your appendix.

36:20.091 --> 36:21.717
You want me to call Carla?

36:22.459 --> 36:23.441
You were asking about her.

36:26.106 --> 36:27.088
What else did I say?

36:27.834 --> 36:29.808
That you screwed up.

36:33.433 --> 36:36.247
That you regret treating me so badly.

36:36.793 --> 36:40.720
That if you could change things,
if you could do it over again...

36:48.918 --> 36:50.925
- I was just coming up to see you.
- Really?

36:51.157 --> 36:54.255
Did you settle things with Polly and...?
Was it Heather?

36:54.708 --> 36:56.716
I apologize.
I was a real jerk today.

36:58.773 --> 37:00.560
I wanted to make it up to you.

37:00.788 --> 37:01.802
Are you free Tuesday?

37:02.419 --> 37:04.425
Great. That's the night
of my sex addicts...

37:04.690 --> 37:06.762
...and compulsive liars therapy group.

37:07.603 --> 37:09.456
I've never acted like this before.

37:09.873 --> 37:11.979
I'm really sorry about what happened.

37:12.210 --> 37:15.078
Maybe we could have lunch.

37:15.984 --> 37:16.967
Maybe.

37:17.392 --> 37:19.726
In the meantime,
whenever you have an urge...

37:19.951 --> 37:21.860
...to date three women at once...

37:23.311 --> 37:24.488
...snap it.

37:31.373 --> 37:33.675
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.068
What's on your mind?

37:36.972 --> 37:38.466
I'll take you up on your offer.

37:39.819 --> 37:40.583
For dinner?

37:41.708 --> 37:42.951
How about tonight?

37:43.179 --> 37:44.193
Sounds good.

37:44.810 --> 37:45.923
Do you like zabaglione?

37:46.411 --> 37:47.621
Should I?

37:48.266 --> 37:49.826
I know a great Italian place.

37:53.961 --> 37:56.164
Transfer papers on the Heuston boy.

37:56.392 --> 37:57.505
ICU got a bed?

37:57.736 --> 37:59.677
Yeah, they're moving him now.

38:06.182 --> 38:07.295
Thank you, Dr. Ross.

38:07.942 --> 38:08.924
Thanks.

38:15.620 --> 38:16.547
I'm sorry.

38:25.251 --> 38:27.487
Can I get a couple
bottles of lidocaine?

38:27.714 --> 38:30.015
You still here?
I thought you had a date.

38:30.241 --> 38:32.030
- Canceled.
- They busted you?

38:32.257 --> 38:33.501
They busted me.

38:33.729 --> 38:35.419
Men are so stupid.

38:35.648 --> 38:37.558
How many women did you date
when you were with me?

38:37.792 --> 38:38.937
- Just you.
- Really?

38:39.168 --> 38:43.226
Except for that night that my neighbor
broke up with her boyfriend.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.821
- I had to comfort her.
- So that was a public service.

38:46.078 --> 38:48.631
- Other than that, I was faithful.
- I feel blessed.

38:48.862 --> 38:50.748
- I still have dinner reservations.
- Where?

38:50.973 --> 38:52.020
La Soir Áe.

38:52.253 --> 38:53.747
You never took me to La Soir Áe.

38:53.981 --> 38:57.461
Well, just an oversight
which I would like to correct.

38:58.012 --> 39:00.378
I'll have to take
a look at my calendar.

39:04.027 --> 39:04.921
What are you doing?

39:05.146 --> 39:06.968
- Practicing one-handed sutures.
- What's that?

39:07.290 --> 39:08.118
An eggplant.

39:08.347 --> 39:11.280
- Did they run out of pigs' feet?
- I'm a vegetarian.

39:14.714 --> 39:16.469
You doing anything later?

39:16.760 --> 39:18.615
Actually, I got plans.

39:21.143 --> 39:22.605
Well, maybe some other time.

39:23.543 --> 39:25.430
If you want, you could come with me.

39:26.774 --> 39:28.051
Yeah. I'd love to.

39:28.406 --> 39:29.234
Where?

39:33.877 --> 39:35.883
How could you forget
about our timecards?

39:36.116 --> 39:39.248
- I didn't forget.
- Then why didn't we get our paychecks?

39:39.476 --> 39:42.442
I don't know. Someone in
Administration must have screwed up.

39:42.675 --> 39:45.674
I distinctly remember
collecting all the timecards...

39:45.906 --> 39:47.183
...wrapping them up...

39:47.410 --> 39:49.614
...and then stuffing them
in my purse...

40:03.664 --> 40:06.150
Good, but you're supposed
to hit your own target.

40:06.510 --> 40:08.681
Might want to keep
your eyes open this time.

40:08.910 --> 40:10.252
Let me show you.

40:10.797 --> 40:11.560
Relax.

40:12.781 --> 40:15.683
The trick is to caress the butt...

40:15.948 --> 40:17.955
...and squeeze the trigger slowly...

40:18.188 --> 40:19.366
- Oh, my God!
- What?

40:19.660 --> 40:20.609
- Over there.
- Where?

40:20.971 --> 40:22.149
Maybe she won't see us.

40:22.379 --> 40:24.289
- That woman in the red sweater.
- The tall one?

40:24.651 --> 40:26.210
- Don't look.
- Why?

40:26.699 --> 40:29.416
That's my ex-girlfriend, Amy Elliott.

40:29.642 --> 40:31.102
- Girlfriend?
- Cop.

40:31.337 --> 40:34.054
I broke up with her two months ago.
She's jealous as hell.

40:47.942 --> 40:50.309
- More champagne?
- Are you trying to get me drunk?

40:50.534 --> 40:52.421
Yeah, I need the company.

40:53.029 --> 40:55.101
So you lost all three, right?

40:57.092 --> 40:58.718
I told you.

41:00.164 --> 41:02.138
- And your day?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

41:03.235 --> 41:05.275
So what do you want
to do after dinner?

41:06.946 --> 41:08.124
We could see a movie.

41:09.442 --> 41:10.205
Go bowling.

41:12.833 --> 41:14.010
I forgot.

41:15.617 --> 41:17.404
Let's just get more champagne.

41:17.632 --> 41:18.744
I like that idea.

41:23.999 --> 41:25.209
I had a really nice time.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.991
I hope it is the first of many.

41:30.558 --> 41:31.931
There's my car.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.546
Wanna get some coffee?
I know a great place.

41:34.781 --> 41:37.169
It's getting late
and I gotta work early tomorrow.

41:39.708 --> 41:41.137
That's the real reason?

41:45.467 --> 41:46.840
Well, I'm afraid.

41:47.450 --> 41:48.399
Of what?

41:48.762 --> 41:50.453
Of liking you too much.

41:58.616 --> 41:59.860
What's wrong?

42:05.815 --> 42:08.432
Nobody's done that
in a really long time.

42:14.197 --> 42:15.790
Aren't you afraid?

42:16.305 --> 42:22.498
