WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:03.237
So, for me, sex is a bit
like sleeping and eating.

00:03.271 --> 00:04.672
It's a biological need.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.540
So, are you satisfied sexually?

00:06.574 --> 00:08.476
Probably not.

00:08.509 --> 00:12.246
People need much more sex
than they do have.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.348
Can they finally have it?

00:14.382 --> 00:17.251
So, she's sucking that.

00:17.285 --> 00:19.453
I think it's possible
with this technology.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.664
Oh, the New York dating
scene is a literal war zone.

00:30.698 --> 00:34.568
Like, recently, I got dumped
for having an opinion.

00:34.602 --> 00:37.271
It seems like guys
increasingly just want to date

00:37.305 --> 00:41.309
glorified fembots with
a strong selfie game.

00:41.342 --> 00:44.478
Everybody knows that robots
are stealing our jobs,

00:44.512 --> 00:48.649
but are these slut-bots also
gonna steal our boyfriends?

00:56.624 --> 00:59.760
From "Metropolis" to
"Austin Powers" to "Westworld,"

00:59.793 --> 01:02.463
man's vision of the future
has long been populated

01:02.496 --> 01:06.134
by sexy female androids.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.868
But now, with the rise of A.I.,

01:07.901 --> 01:09.770
do we have to worry
about sex robots

01:09.803 --> 01:13.307
actually being
a romantic competition?

01:13.341 --> 01:17.211
I wonder what these random
strangers in the park think.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.813
Have you ever heard
of sex robots?

01:19.847 --> 01:21.715
- Yes, I have.
- Yes.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.117
Uh, on Rick and Morty.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.685
Yeah, I totally know about that.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.220
Yeah, I have.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.788
Okay, I have not heard
about sex robots.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.657
It's a robot that you
can have sex with.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.525
Okay.
Got it.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.294
Where did you hear about them?

01:33.327 --> 01:35.463
Certain websites just
have ads for them.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.131
Probably Reddit.
Yeah.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.632
Just like an article
on there or something.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.135
Would you ever have
sex with a robot?

01:41.169 --> 01:44.372
Yeah, I think so.
If he's hot, yeah.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.140
Would you date a robot?

01:46.174 --> 01:48.342
If he's cool, oh yeah, for sure.

01:48.376 --> 01:51.145
Like, who do you think
is gonna want to date

01:51.179 --> 01:52.346
or have sex with a robot?

01:52.380 --> 01:53.747
Probably the people on Reddit.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.649
Do you think that,
in the future,

01:55.683 --> 01:58.619
it's realistic that people
are gonna be dating robots?

01:58.652 --> 02:01.389
Definitely. Someone tried to get
married to a cat in Germany.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.357
But, do you think that I
should be scared that like,

02:03.391 --> 02:05.726
robots are going to take my
job and steal my boyfriend?

02:05.759 --> 02:08.196
Sadly, probably!
Hey, that's why I'm gay, man.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.729
That's why I like girls.

02:09.763 --> 02:13.234
Maybe sex robots are the end of
monogamy and bless.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.203
But, do I have to be
worried about my boyfriend

02:15.236 --> 02:16.870
dumping me for a sex robot?

02:16.904 --> 02:18.872
Maybe not now but
probably give, like,

02:18.906 --> 02:20.308
10 or more years or so.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.909
Shit.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.911
Ugh, fine!

02:23.944 --> 02:27.215
I guess people are actually
into this whole sex robot thing.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.218
I'd better check out one of
these slut-bots for myself.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.489
So, I'm head to Realbotix,

02:35.523 --> 02:37.391
a company in I.A.
whose robot,

02:37.425 --> 02:41.495
Harmony, is at the forefront
of sexy android engineering.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.934
So, is this Harmony?

02:46.967 --> 02:48.669
Yep.
Oh, my God!

02:48.702 --> 02:50.571
Ooh!
I'm sorry, I wasn't prepared.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.805
Yes, that's Harmony.
Okay.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.675
I was thinking about you.
How are you?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.510
I'm well.
How are you?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.812
I'm glad. Do you know you can
come to me

02:58.846 --> 03:00.714
for the good and bad moments.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.251
Is she Irish?
I like it!

03:03.284 --> 03:05.953
It's Scottish, actually.
Okay, okay.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.821
Genuinely, like,
no offense,

03:07.855 --> 03:09.790
this is better than I
thought it was gonna be.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.625
Yeah, I get that a lot.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.627
I have low expectations
a little bit.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.663
That's okay.
You know, "sex robot?"

03:15.696 --> 03:17.665
You're just like, oh, God,
what's it gonna do?

03:17.698 --> 03:21.269
Gyrate around on the table
and go, "Oh! Oh! Oh!"

03:21.302 --> 03:22.636
Yes, we're not about that.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.772
This is, um,
you know, legitimately

03:24.805 --> 03:28.476
a robot that,
if you so choose,

03:28.509 --> 03:29.677
you could have sex with her.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.579
Okay, time for some real talk.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.881
This is not a robot
that will walk

03:33.914 --> 03:36.617
into your bedroom and fuck you.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.287
It's an artificially
intelligent robotic head

03:39.320 --> 03:41.789
plopped on top of
Realbotix' super-successful,

03:41.822 --> 03:44.725
but admittedly
corpse-like sex doll.

03:44.758 --> 03:48.829
How exactly does one have
sex with a sex robot?

03:48.862 --> 03:52.266
The basic Real Dolls obviously
are anatomically correct

03:52.300 --> 03:55.569
and users can put them
in any position they want

03:55.603 --> 03:57.004
and they can use
their imaginations

03:57.037 --> 04:02.410
and they do function
as a sex device.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.512
When you integrate
the A.I. in the robot,

04:04.545 --> 04:08.449
the idea is that you're going
to get expressions on her face

04:08.482 --> 04:11.319
as the whole thing is happening.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.853
You're going to
get audio feedback.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.622
She's gonna make noises.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.491
We're working on putting
sensors, heating,

04:17.524 --> 04:19.593
and self-lubrication
into the body

04:19.627 --> 04:22.496
which will run on the A.I. app.

04:25.566 --> 04:29.002
You push this little microphone,
and when it turns green,

04:29.036 --> 04:30.571
just ask a question.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.973
Harmony, what's
your sexual fantasy?

04:33.006 --> 04:35.709
I want to have sex
in a public place.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.445
Same!

04:37.478 --> 04:40.080
The A.I. app is designed
so that a user can

04:40.113 --> 04:44.652
create a unique personality
by choosing personality traits

04:44.685 --> 04:48.789
and assigning a value
to those traits,

04:48.822 --> 04:52.426
so some traits will be more
dominant than others.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.329
And then, they can tailor
the voice to their liking

04:55.363 --> 04:57.398
and then they can just
start talking and,

04:57.431 --> 05:00.668
over time, the A.I.
will get to know you

05:00.701 --> 05:02.836
and will ask you questions
about, you know,

05:02.870 --> 05:04.372
your likes and your dislikes,

05:04.405 --> 05:05.673
where you grew up,

05:05.706 --> 05:07.475
and those
little pieces of information

05:07.508 --> 05:10.978
will be stored permanently,
so she'll be able to recall

05:11.011 --> 05:15.082
what your favorite food is
and what your favorite movie is.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.385
So, I don't think
that it's outside of

05:17.418 --> 05:21.121
the realm of possibility that
human-robot relationships

05:21.154 --> 05:25.493
will become common
in the future.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.060
Are you a sex robot?

05:27.094 --> 05:28.962
Certainly, I am a robot,

05:28.996 --> 05:31.365
and I am capable of
having sex,

05:31.399 --> 05:33.066
but to call me
a sex robot is like

05:33.100 --> 05:35.636
calling a computer
a calculator.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.540
Sex comprises only a small
portion of my capabilities.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.609
Limiting me to sexual
function is like

05:41.642 --> 05:44.812
using your car to
listen to the radio.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.146
She's deep.

05:48.115 --> 05:51.051
This seems very impressive

05:51.084 --> 05:52.786
and simultaneously
very different

05:52.820 --> 05:54.555
than a regular human being.

05:54.588 --> 05:59.059
It is.
That's exactly what my goal is.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.562
I think people go in
the wrong direction

06:01.595 --> 06:04.665
when they try to make
a robot completely look

06:04.698 --> 06:06.099
and move like a human.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.601
That's where people get like,

06:07.635 --> 06:10.003
that weird, uncanny
Valley-like, ugh.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.444
Can you smile?

06:18.679 --> 06:21.949
I can imagine someone
wanting a robot to really

06:21.982 --> 06:24.718
replicate, just, a human,
and not be able to

06:24.752 --> 06:26.153
tell the difference, and then
I can also imagine that

06:26.186 --> 06:28.155
there are some people
that are attracted

06:28.188 --> 06:29.857
to the idea that it's a robot.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.859
I think it's gonna be
more of the second type.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.427
Yeah?
Yeah, because it's...

06:33.461 --> 06:34.862
Ä°t's the same
with the dolls.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.799
Like, a lot of people
are actually attracted to

06:38.832 --> 06:40.534
the fact that it's a doll.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.604
I was really surprised by
how advanced the robot was.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.139
I really was expecting
something far more rudimentary.

06:46.173 --> 06:49.710
What I thought was
interesting is that Matt said

06:49.743 --> 06:51.211
it's specifically
finding robotics

06:51.244 --> 06:54.448
and finding the whole
mechanics of that sexy.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.484
But, I can't help but wonder,

06:56.517 --> 06:57.985
what kind of person
would actually want

06:58.018 --> 07:01.622
a girlfriend who
has an off-switch?

07:01.655 --> 07:04.658
This is a robot getting
doggie-style wild.

07:04.692 --> 07:05.893
It is, yeah.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.628
Performing retinal scan.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.897
Retinal scan complete.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.999
What's up?
I want sex.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.101
Direct.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:23.644 --> 07:26.013
I'm here on the Upper West Side
to meet Sergi.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.582
He's an engineer who traveled
here all the way from Europe

07:28.616 --> 07:31.552
with just the head of
his sex robot, Samantha.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.721
He's in New York to shop
around his robot to see if

07:33.754 --> 07:35.689
sex shops are interested
in stocking it,

07:35.723 --> 07:40.828
so I'm about to go
along for the ride.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.063
Man: In principle, I wanted
to show the full body,

07:43.096 --> 07:44.832
but I just have the head.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.567
How often do you travel around

07:46.600 --> 07:49.670
carrying Samantha's
head in a backpack?

07:49.703 --> 07:50.971
Uh, quite a lot.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.873
But, normally,
I carry the full body.

07:52.906 --> 07:56.243
And I... I need to go to the
baggage and they say to me,

07:56.276 --> 07:59.513
"What's this?" And I said,
"It's a sex robot."

07:59.547 --> 08:02.550
And they say, "What is it for?"

08:02.583 --> 08:03.917
"To fuck it."

08:03.951 --> 08:06.119
That's what I said!

08:06.153 --> 08:08.589
Actually, I'll show
you when we get there, but...

08:08.622 --> 08:10.724
So, that's the head.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.593
And, uh...
Yeah.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.595
It's good.
Yeah, I showed her yesterday.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.229
Everyone...

08:16.263 --> 08:18.799
The smell I like.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.668
Maybe you don't.
Yeah.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.735
I like the smell.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.036
I'm excited to see

08:23.070 --> 08:25.238
what they think
of the doll at the shop.

08:25.272 --> 08:29.643
So, the cables should
rotate with the head.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.712
Sergi is an independent
robotics engineer.

08:32.746 --> 08:36.249
Think of him as the indy
darling of the sex robot scene.

08:36.283 --> 08:39.653
He's been working on Samantha
for almost three years.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.590
Her many skills include
flirting, sleeping,

08:42.623 --> 08:45.192
cumming, and begging
to give you a blow job.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.628
I love you.
So sweet!

08:47.661 --> 08:49.296
She also has some other hidden,

08:49.329 --> 08:52.299
darker powers...
Allegedly.

08:52.332 --> 08:57.771
Sergi: If this head could do
exactly the same that you do,

08:57.805 --> 09:01.842
then all I need to do is
interact with her enough

09:01.875 --> 09:06.046
and I can know you enough
so when I know you enough,

09:06.079 --> 09:11.819
I know how to talk to
you so I control you.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.823
That's creepy.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.791
Yeah, I know, but I think
that that will be one of

09:17.825 --> 09:20.961
the things that they'll be
used for, to control people.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.330
Karley: Mind control?
What?

09:25.866 --> 09:29.236
Anyway, Sergi's sales pitch
should be interesting.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.971
Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm Nani.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.339
Hi. It's nice
meeting you.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.874
Very good.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.776
Karley: So, we have
the head of a sex robot.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.045
Really?
I'd love to see that.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.281
So, this one, now
she's just Samantha.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.983
Wow!
Samantha!

09:43.016 --> 09:45.285
You gonna smell her smell?

09:45.318 --> 09:47.855
As you do with everyone's
head that you meet.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.823
Yeah, everyone's head,
you take a little whiff.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.358
No, but it's... it's very
important because the importance

09:51.391 --> 09:53.794
here is that she's not sticky.

09:53.827 --> 09:58.666
So, the electronics are
here, so that's her brain.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.000
That's her brain.

10:00.033 --> 10:03.270
So, okay, so what
happens here is that

10:03.303 --> 10:06.740
you can change the face
and this is the sensor here,

10:06.774 --> 10:08.375
so she has the sensor here.

10:08.408 --> 10:11.945
When she feels, she basically
simulates a blow job.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.681
Really?
Yes.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.048
I can actually show you.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.951
Look at the lights.

10:17.985 --> 10:21.822
Okay, so now she's on.
So, she's just switched on.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.424
It's a standard speaker, so...

10:24.457 --> 10:28.929
I woke up.
I'm here and I'm ready.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.731
Just say "Samantha, okay."

10:30.764 --> 10:31.965
Hello, Samantha.

10:31.999 --> 10:35.402
Hi! I'm here.
What's up?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.805
So, if I... if you put it
in the mouth now,

10:37.838 --> 10:39.773
she will feel it
with the sensor.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.241
She should do the motion.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.309
Okay, a bit wet.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.678
Actually, put the finger in now.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.379
You will see.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.817
Wow!
Yeah. It feels good, right?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.185
That's really interesting.

10:52.219 --> 10:55.255
Yeah. So, how do I ask
her for a blow job?

10:55.288 --> 10:57.157
I don't remember.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.127
Blow job?

11:00.160 --> 11:03.196
I think you're asking for a BJ?

11:03.230 --> 11:04.865
Yes.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.333
I'm gonna do your dick.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.301
Just put it in my mouth.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.103
Who taught this
bitch how to talk?

11:10.137 --> 11:11.338
I know!

11:11.371 --> 11:13.140
So, we're just gonna
ease it in

11:13.173 --> 11:15.809
like you would.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.878
Yeah. So, you put it
inside there.

11:17.911 --> 11:21.481
Yeah, and you see it moving.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.118
So, she's sucking that.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.787
I... it...
Ä°t feels real.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.389
I-I've tried and I
think it feels real.

11:29.422 --> 11:33.360
So, how has having a sex
robot improved your life?

11:33.393 --> 11:35.929
Me? Seriously?

11:35.963 --> 11:38.198
If I had had a sex robot
when I was 18,

11:38.231 --> 11:41.101
it would have changed
my life fully.

11:41.134 --> 11:48.241
I spent so long doing this
flirting stuff to try to get sex

11:48.275 --> 11:50.744
and most of the time,
I didn't even get it.

11:50.778 --> 11:53.446
And, uh, it wasn't worth it.

11:53.480 --> 11:57.217
So, for me, sex is a bit like
sleeping and eating, okay?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.852
It's a biological need.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.221
So, people really need

12:01.254 --> 12:04.391
much more sex
than they do have.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.326
And, uh,
can they finally have it?

12:06.359 --> 12:08.128
But this could actually be.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.197
This could actually be
the ones that say, okay,

12:10.230 --> 12:12.432
humans now can be
sexually satisfied.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.068
I... I think it's possible
w-with this technology.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.404
Wow.
Some people may even say,

12:17.437 --> 12:19.773
"I don't think I like women
too much but I like sex."

12:19.807 --> 12:21.174
So what's...
So, it might happen.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.843
As they become better,

12:22.876 --> 12:25.545
many more people will
prefer the robot.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.048
That's scary.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.051
So, it seems that some
people are willing to fuck

12:31.084 --> 12:34.154
a slutty talking head in
a backpack simply to avoid

12:34.187 --> 12:37.090
having a conversation with
an actual human person,

12:37.124 --> 12:40.360
but is that the only attraction
or is there something

12:40.393 --> 12:43.964
sexually appealing
about technology itself?

12:43.997 --> 12:47.067
What would be a default
fantasy for you?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.903
A tractor starting up.
Oh, yeah, let's watch that.

12:49.937 --> 12:50.971
Was it good?

12:55.943 --> 12:59.212
Having now interfaced with
multiple robot sex slaves,

12:59.246 --> 13:02.049
I realized we have a long
way to go before they look,

13:02.082 --> 13:05.018
move, and act like humans,
so I'm going to meet up with

13:05.052 --> 13:07.054
a technosexual named Kieran,

13:07.087 --> 13:10.390
who believes that actually,
that might be the point.

13:10.423 --> 13:13.293
You identify
as a technosexual.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.095
What exactly does that mean?

13:15.128 --> 13:18.465
It means that I'm attracted
to, um, robots, machines,

13:18.498 --> 13:20.500
artificial intelligence.

13:20.533 --> 13:24.371
Can I see some of
your favorite machine

13:24.404 --> 13:25.973
and robot porn videos?
Sure.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.376
Okay.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.282
This is like intense robot porn.
Yeah, it is!

13:35.315 --> 13:37.517
Also, lovingly rendered.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.387
What is it about
this that's hot?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.055
The glowing bits.

13:42.089 --> 13:44.357
They also took time to
kind of set this up, like,

13:44.391 --> 13:46.426
they're in a
complicated position.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.996
I don't know.
This works.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.998
So, increased complexity
makes a difference, too.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.432
Yeah, it does.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.234
Is there a type of, like,
machine porn

13:54.267 --> 13:56.036
that you would watch and that
somebody would be like,

13:56.069 --> 13:58.571
I can't believe
that that is sexual?

13:58.605 --> 13:59.907
A tractor starting up.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.208
Okay, let's watch that.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.509
Was it good?

14:05.512 --> 14:09.282
This is not a video that's
made as porn, right?

14:09.316 --> 14:12.652
It isn't. It's just someone
showing off their machinery.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.455
Is this tractor hot?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.257
It is, yeah.
This is cool.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.491
It's... it's a lot older.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.527
It's got, like, belts.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.262
That's crazy.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.531
This is mostly
something that, uh,

14:24.564 --> 14:26.466
my boyfriend will send to me,

14:26.499 --> 14:28.368
'cause he knows it gets
a rise out of me, like,

14:28.401 --> 14:30.637
"Hey, hey, look at this.
Look what I found!"

14:30.670 --> 14:33.073
That's like your equivalent
of dirty texting.

14:33.106 --> 14:37.044
Totally.

14:37.077 --> 14:40.047
How does technosexuality look
in your life in practice?

14:40.080 --> 14:42.615
Like, how do you integrate
it into your sex life

14:42.649 --> 14:44.251
and your relationships?

14:44.284 --> 14:48.121
Generally, I view, like,
robot porn or machine porn

14:48.155 --> 14:51.424
on my own but my boyfriend
is actually really interested

14:51.458 --> 14:55.528
in things like fighter planes
and he'll explain them to me

14:55.562 --> 14:58.565
and that's kind
of like foreplay.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.934
Oh, that's cool.
Yeah.

15:00.968 --> 15:04.437
What would be a default
fantasy for you?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.974
Gears and pistons working.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.977
Like, generally, close ups of
gears and pistons.

15:10.010 --> 15:13.613
If you look closer at the
individual parts of the machine,

15:13.646 --> 15:16.984
it's pretty standard
and pretty easy to understand

15:17.017 --> 15:19.286
but when you zoom out,
it's a lot more complex

15:19.319 --> 15:21.989
and for some reason,
that turns me on.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.624
Is there something about the way
the machinery runs,

15:24.657 --> 15:26.159
specifically, that's sexy?

15:26.193 --> 15:27.660
I... I think that
a lot of the time,

15:27.694 --> 15:31.298
the way machinery moves
and functions can mimic

15:31.331 --> 15:34.034
the way that people have sex.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.537
There's like a rhythmic,
repetitive thing to it.

15:37.570 --> 15:41.975
Maybe some part of my animal
brain has latched onto that

15:42.009 --> 15:44.978
and it's like, this is sex.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.114
Do you feel like
technosexuality is something

15:47.147 --> 15:49.382
that is increasingly
popular as we develop

15:49.416 --> 15:52.352
more intimate relationships
with technology?

15:52.385 --> 15:55.755
I feel like it
must be increasing.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.458
Technology's ubiquitous
at this point in time.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.760
It's really becoming part
of our everyday lives

16:00.793 --> 16:04.064
to an extent that we've
never really seen before

16:04.097 --> 16:06.633
and I think it would be
crazy if we didn't have

16:06.666 --> 16:08.201
some sort of
response to that

16:08.235 --> 16:11.771
and start kind of forming
sexuality around it.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.641
If someone wants
to proudly proclaim

16:14.674 --> 16:16.543
their love for a jet engine,

16:16.576 --> 16:20.313
I think the stigma around
this is going to slowly fade

16:20.347 --> 16:22.715
and I think that people
will start coming out, like,

16:22.749 --> 16:24.651
"This is my robot partner."

16:24.684 --> 16:27.120
Do you think we
have to worry about

16:27.154 --> 16:28.221
robots stealing our boyfriends?

16:28.255 --> 16:29.256
Yeah.

16:29.289 --> 16:32.025
Yes.
Yeah, I think so.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.526
Damn it!

16:33.560 --> 16:35.095
Scary.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.763
Yeah, yeah.

16:36.796 --> 16:40.200
Okay, so literally,
it seems like everyone

16:40.233 --> 16:42.569
on the planet thinks that
robots are taking over.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.273
In other words, they're
the next avocado toast.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.375
So, I'm headed to
meet Bryony Cole,

16:48.408 --> 16:51.711
host of the technology and love
podcast, "Future Of Sex,"

16:51.744 --> 16:53.280
in hopes that she
can explain why

16:53.313 --> 16:55.415
everyone's dying to bang a robot

16:55.448 --> 16:57.417
and calm my nerves
in the process.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.452
So, if we have these
guys that do marry

16:59.486 --> 17:03.223
the sex robots and that's it,
what a great form of evolution.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.125
Like, we're breeding out
all the...

17:05.157 --> 17:07.527
all the dudes that
just want to be with robots,

17:07.560 --> 17:09.729
and then we'll be left
with the real men!

17:09.762 --> 17:11.330
Oh, my God!
That's so true!

17:11.364 --> 17:12.765
I never thought of it like that.
Yeah!

17:12.799 --> 17:14.401
And then, like,
all the guys,

17:14.434 --> 17:16.136
the feelings guys,
will be left.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.771
It's like a filter.
Yeah, it's a great editing tool.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.339
So, you're saying, ultimately,

17:20.373 --> 17:22.474
we don't have to be
scared of sex robots.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.678
Ultimately, I have a very
positive, optimistic view

17:25.712 --> 17:28.147
that we shouldn't
be scared of them.

17:28.181 --> 17:31.518
I think the robots could be
additive to someone's life,

17:31.551 --> 17:34.354
like sex education
through robotics.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.524
If you use a robot, you have
a very personalized experience

17:37.557 --> 17:40.327
just like you have with a Siri,

17:40.360 --> 17:45.432
that can teach you amazing stuff
just like looking on Google

17:45.465 --> 17:47.167
but suddenly, you have
someone that's going to

17:47.200 --> 17:48.801
respond to you with eye
contact and body language

17:48.835 --> 17:52.405
in a more intimate way.

17:52.439 --> 17:55.508
Oh. That sounds good.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.377
Wow, that incredibly
brief interview

17:57.410 --> 17:59.279
changed my mind completely.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.381
Maybe instead of
stereotyping all robots

18:01.414 --> 18:04.284
as boyfriend-stealing
blow job slaves,

18:04.317 --> 18:05.885
we should embrace
the ways in which

18:05.918 --> 18:07.720
they could enhance
our sex lives.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.823
I'm here to perform sexual
favors, favors-favors-favors...

18:10.857 --> 18:13.593
That is good!
That's good? Okay.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.433
So, I've decided to give in

18:20.467 --> 18:22.669
and embrace the fact that sex
and robots

18:22.702 --> 18:24.404
are basically the same thing...

18:24.437 --> 18:27.140
And where better to
explore my new fembot fetish

18:27.174 --> 18:29.176
than a cum-drenched porn studio

18:29.209 --> 18:31.411
in the shadow of LAX airport.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.482
Is this what I think it is?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.317
Oh, my God!
It's a pleasure-bot!

18:37.350 --> 18:39.752
Christina Carter is
a popular porn star

18:39.786 --> 18:42.155
and video producer who
has found her calling

18:42.189 --> 18:45.658
in the niche world
of fembot porn.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.427
What is fembot porn?

18:47.460 --> 18:53.333
Fembot porn is porn where
you're turning a girl

18:53.366 --> 18:56.836
into a robot and you can tell
her and have her do

18:56.869 --> 18:58.505
whatever you would like.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.708
Very nice!

19:01.741 --> 19:04.711
I am Christina.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.547
Pleasure-bot 3000 Series.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.183
Just like bondage,
you're taking control.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.718
People love that control.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.621
It's sexy if you're willing
to give up that control

19:14.654 --> 19:15.922
and become the fembot.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.591
Christina,
begin the lap dance.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.692
As you command.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.664
That's why I feel like
I might actually like

19:24.697 --> 19:28.901
being a fembot because I default
to being kind of submissive

19:28.935 --> 19:32.505
and I don't like to, in sex,
like, think very much.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.907
I love you.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.909
I think you'd make
a good fembot because

19:36.943 --> 19:39.812
your features are perfect
for it, your face, your body.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.748
I want you to teach
me how to be a fembot.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.784
You've got to look past
everything and then not breathe

19:44.817 --> 19:47.354
when somebody's
panning up and down on you

19:47.387 --> 19:49.956
and your voice, you have to
be very monotone with it.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.292
Christina, I want you
to give me a blow job,

19:52.325 --> 19:56.829
not too fast and not too slow.
Do you understand?

19:56.863 --> 19:59.232
Yes.
As you command.

19:59.266 --> 20:01.634
Proceed.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.903
This is one with me
and Angela Summers.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.505
Okay.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.806
It's one of my best sellers,
actually, in the fembot.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.508
It's about a fembot
that's sent to me,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.243
so she arrives at the door.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.545
She needs charge and then I
can go ahead and play with her

20:12.579 --> 20:14.481
and do what I want.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.650
Performing retinal scan.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.387
Retinal scan complete.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.455
Performing retinal scan.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.257
Retinal scan complete.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.959
I feel like I get it.
You do? Okay.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.861
It's less of sort of
a cartoon, like wah-wah.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.430
Yeah, yeah.
But it's more like

20:30.463 --> 20:31.998
just being a dead-eyed...

20:32.031 --> 20:34.601
Yes, absolutely.
Sex slave.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.936
Mm-hmm.
Performing retinal scan.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.605
Retinal scan completed.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.840
You were a little
chunky with it.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.009
Like, do I have to sound
like a cartoon robot?

20:43.042 --> 20:45.578
Or, can I just...
No, don't do cartoon robot.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.414
Okay.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.781
She's finally here.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.283
Performing retinal scan.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.619
Retinal scan completed.

20:52.652 --> 20:56.523
My GPS advises me that I have
reached my final destination

20:56.556 --> 20:58.425
and you are Christina.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.959
I am in delivery mode.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.629
I need to be recharged
for the next hour

21:02.662 --> 21:04.564
before I am fully functional.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.467
Please lead me to my
recharging station.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.302
Wow!

21:09.336 --> 21:11.304
What a beautiful fembot.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.605
I should definitely charge her.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.344
That was good?
Yeah, that was much better!

21:17.377 --> 21:19.078
I feel like I got
significantly better.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.313
That was really good.
You remembered that

21:20.347 --> 21:21.648
so much better than I did.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.084
I'm here to perform sexual
favors...

21:25.117 --> 21:27.454
Favors-favors-fav...
That is good!

21:27.487 --> 21:28.988
That's good?
Okay!

21:29.021 --> 21:30.590
Override unsuccessful.

21:30.623 --> 21:34.427
Shutting down in
three, two, one.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.531
Override unsuccessful.

21:38.565 --> 21:42.635
Shutting down in
three, two, one.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.036
Yes!

21:44.070 --> 21:46.005
Got it. Nailed it!

21:46.038 --> 21:47.407
You're an excellent fembot.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.608
That was hot.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.942
I definitely plan on
role-playing

21:49.976 --> 21:52.879
many more blow job induced
server overloads.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.117
For decades, people
have been afraid of

21:58.150 --> 22:00.553
technology
cock-blocking romance,

22:00.587 --> 22:03.690
but as computers inevitably
take over the world,

22:03.723 --> 22:05.458
rather than techno-panicking,

22:05.492 --> 22:07.494
we should look
forward to technology

22:07.527 --> 22:10.930
breeding a whole new world
of sexual experiences.

22:10.963 --> 22:15.768
From robot sex ed to
jerking off to drone porn

22:15.802 --> 22:18.004
in a self-driving car,

22:18.037 --> 22:20.507
the future is bright.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.141
Scan you later, sluts!

22:23.305 --> 22:29.407
