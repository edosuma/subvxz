00:31.834 --> 00:34.701
You played great today.

00:34.767 --> 00:37.767
I was doing what I'm good at.

00:39.100 --> 00:41.300
You know what else I'm really good at?

00:55.300 --> 00:57.734
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:57.801 --> 00:59.567
All right. Showtime, baby.

00:59.634 --> 01:01.634
Get out the door. Get out, man.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.667
Hey.

01:14.734 --> 01:17.367
Ugh. Hair of the dog?

01:19.567 --> 01:21.501
Dude, that chick last night was all over you,

01:21.567 --> 01:23.601
and she was 5 kinds of hot.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.834
You don't got to tell me.

01:26.901 --> 01:29.234
Excuse me, Mr. McNeil?

01:29.267 --> 01:30.567
Can I have your autograph?

01:30.601 --> 01:32.567
Sure.

01:32.601 --> 01:35.133
You should stay in school...

01:35.200 --> 01:38.501
don't do drugs, recycle, and all that jazz.

01:38.567 --> 01:39.667
All right?

01:39.734 --> 01:40.734
Dude, was she freaky?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.834
Hey. She was freaky, wasn't she?

01:42.901 --> 01:44.567
Was she a little bit freaky?

01:44.601 --> 01:45.667
She a little freaky?

01:45.734 --> 01:46.901
Hey, not in front of the kid, man. Yo!

01:46.934 --> 01:48.501
Start with you. I told you.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.234
Dang! Hey! Was she a lot or a little freaky?

01:50.267 --> 01:51.667
Man, she was a little bit freaky.

01:51.734 --> 01:53.634
You better stop...
I'm sorry. Cabe McNeil?

01:53.701 --> 01:55.601
I'm sorry for you.

01:55.667 --> 01:58.133
Maybe you can tell me
your name, too, darlin'.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.634
My name is Detective Ferro,

02:00.701 --> 02:02.501
and you're under arrest
for contributing to

02:02.567 --> 02:04.434
the delinquency of a minor.

02:04.467 --> 02:05.434
What?

02:05.467 --> 02:07.501
For what?

02:07.567 --> 02:09.701
Some people call it statutory rape.

02:13.601 --> 02:16.267
Please stand up, sir.

02:16.300 --> 02:19.000
What's going on?

02:53.567 --> 02:55.200
Let's see. That's good. You work for me.

02:55.267 --> 02:57.467
Ok. You both need to see
my chimpanzee sex tape.

02:57.501 --> 02:58.667
Oh, that sounds like fun.

02:58.734 --> 03:00.400
Oh, it's the most interesting
research I've done.

03:00.467 --> 03:02.801
The female Bonobo chimp,
she'll entice a mate

03:02.834 --> 03:06.467
and sometimes attack with
no provocation whatsoever.

03:06.501 --> 03:07.834
Cal?

03:07.901 --> 03:09.634
Oh, I...

03:09.701 --> 03:12.634
I'm familiar with the phenomenon.

03:12.701 --> 03:15.200
We'll talk.

03:15.267 --> 03:17.634
Chimpanzee sex later. IRS case now.

03:17.701 --> 03:19.133
Oh, right. We're going to go see the kook

03:19.200 --> 03:20.434
waiting for us at his compound.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.834
Don't call him a kook.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.100
What am I supposed to call
the leader of a cult?

03:23.167 --> 03:24.667
The IRS thinks he's a tax fraud.

03:24.701 --> 03:26.968
And even cults have rights.

03:27.033 --> 03:28.901
Statutory rape.

03:28.968 --> 03:31.200
So the former hang 'em high prosecutor

03:31.267 --> 03:33.634
isn't above defending the
wicked when the price is right.

03:33.701 --> 03:35.968
Well, my client had no idea
Susan Reed was underage.

03:36.033 --> 03:38.334
She was on a college campus. She had a fake ID.

03:38.367 --> 03:40.501
She was drinking. She
looks to be at least 20.

03:40.534 --> 03:42.300
This girl goes to school with our daughter.

03:42.367 --> 03:44.968
Emily knows the girl, but they
don't travel in similar circles.

03:45.033 --> 03:47.167
And how does she feel about
you representing this guy?

03:47.234 --> 03:48.901
She understands my position.

03:48.968 --> 03:50.067
Which is?

03:50.133 --> 03:51.634
Well, if Cabe McNeil were white,

03:51.701 --> 03:52.901
these charges wouldn't
even have been brought.

03:52.968 --> 03:54.901
I mean, Susan Reed came home late.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.234
She was intoxicated. Her father went ballistic.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.601
So she broke down and told him where she was.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.634
In a black man's bed. That's right.

04:01.701 --> 04:03.801
Before Mr. Reed had even
hung up the phone with the cops,

04:03.868 --> 04:05.868
my client was as good as indicted.

04:05.901 --> 04:07.300
See, I don't know.

04:07.367 --> 04:10.133
Underage girls and, you know, sex...

04:10.200 --> 04:12.968
It's really... it's just
not my cup of tea, love.

04:13.033 --> 04:14.968
Hewlett County, Virginia is twice as likely

04:15.067 --> 04:17.834
to bring criminal charges
against blacks as it is whites.

04:17.901 --> 04:19.834
And the A.D.A., Jay Putt, I
went to law school with him.

04:19.901 --> 04:21.466
He's a pompous ass who isn't beyond

04:21.534 --> 04:23.200
overcharging just based on race.

04:23.267 --> 04:26.167
That is why Cabe McNeil is
facing trumped-up sex charges.

04:26.234 --> 04:29.100
Well, that, and he diddled a 16-year-old girl.

04:29.167 --> 04:30.767
I mean, let's not forget that little tidbit, right?

04:30.834 --> 04:33.100
These charges cost him his future.

04:33.167 --> 04:34.267
What do you want from me?

04:34.334 --> 04:36.434
Sex charge is a strict liability crime.

04:36.501 --> 04:40.601
But if I can prove that Cabe truly
believed that Susan was of age,

04:40.667 --> 04:42.601
then I can use that to mitigate the charges.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.100
You really want to defend this guy,

04:44.167 --> 04:45.501
or are you just taking this personally

04:45.567 --> 04:47.367
because of the black and white
leaves on your family tree?

04:47.434 --> 04:49.267
Both.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.567
Well, at least you're being honest.

04:56.367 --> 04:58.300
But I'm not going to blindly help this guy.

04:58.367 --> 04:59.634
I mean, anything I find out,

04:59.701 --> 05:03.200
I'm going to disclose to both
you and the prosecution.

05:03.267 --> 05:04.267
Of course.
Right.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.534
Fine.

05:06.868 --> 05:08.000
Ok.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.434
What happened to my client?

05:18.467 --> 05:20.267
Cons here, someone's in for kid-touching,

05:20.300 --> 05:22.067
they don't ask for details.

05:22.133 --> 05:23.234
Did they let you see a doctor?

05:23.300 --> 05:25.767
I'm fine. Just want to go home.

05:25.834 --> 05:28.601
First, I need you to talk with Dr. Lightman.

05:28.667 --> 05:29.934
What do you want to know?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.734
Just the truth.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.567
Give us a minute?

05:46.667 --> 05:47.934
My baby.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.834
Who is that in there?

05:49.901 --> 05:53.734
That's Cal Lightman, and this
is his associate Ria Torres.

05:53.801 --> 05:56.667
They're experts in deception and witness veracity.

05:56.701 --> 05:58.167
They want to help me help Cabe.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.701
How old are you, Cabe?

05:59.767 --> 06:01.634
22.

06:01.701 --> 06:03.200
How do you feel about being locked up?

06:03.267 --> 06:05.100
I was scared.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.000
Now, tell me you enjoyed it.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.501
What?
Convince me

06:08.534 --> 06:11.667
that being locked up was
nothing. It was a breeze.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.434
Jail was nothing.

06:15.501 --> 06:18.434
I didn't sweat it.

06:18.501 --> 06:20.000
What the hell is he doing?

06:20.033 --> 06:23.000
He's trying get a baseline for
when Cabe is telling the truth.

06:24.701 --> 06:26.300
Cabe always tells the truth.

06:26.367 --> 06:27.968
Did they give you any
medication for your injuries?

06:28.033 --> 06:30.567
2 painkillers.

06:33.067 --> 06:34.834
You like having sex with little girls?

06:34.901 --> 06:36.934
What?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.834
Driver's permits, pigtails...

06:38.901 --> 06:40.534
that kind of thing turns you on?

06:40.567 --> 06:43.067
I thought she was in college.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.767
That's enough.

06:44.834 --> 06:48.167
I'm telling you that I have
the right to see my son.

06:48.234 --> 06:50.067
Calm down. Just let me... I am calm!

06:51.300 --> 06:53.200
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

06:53.234 --> 06:55.334
If I'm going to help
a statutory rapist walk,

06:55.400 --> 06:58.367
I'm going to be damn sure
he's telling the truth, right?

06:58.400 --> 07:00.367
I just want to make sure

07:00.400 --> 07:03.968
my son is ok.

07:04.033 --> 07:05.567
You ok, Cabe?

07:05.601 --> 07:06.901
I'm ok.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.000
I'm right out here.

07:10.067 --> 07:12.234
We're getting you bailed out.

07:16.767 --> 07:19.267
So you weren't sure she was legal.

07:19.334 --> 07:21.167
I assumed she was.

07:21.234 --> 07:25.601
But I mean, high school
girls crash the parties a lot.

07:25.667 --> 07:26.834
And you seek them out?

07:26.901 --> 07:29.033
That's not my thing. Ask anyone.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.434
I don't hang with the chicks

07:30.501 --> 07:31.834
from Parker High and Lynbrook.

07:31.901 --> 07:33.400
I didn't know she was from Lynbrook.

07:33.434 --> 07:34.901
I thought she was my age.

07:34.934 --> 07:39.434
Hey. How often do girls
from Lynbrook Academy

07:39.467 --> 07:41.167
party at Virginia A&M?

07:41.234 --> 07:42.334
Every weekend.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.667
But Susan was talking about econ classes

07:44.734 --> 07:46.434
she was taking, like she went there.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.601
I swear.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.934
The tells I normally pick up on,

07:50.968 --> 07:53.267
painkillers might be masking them,

07:53.300 --> 07:57.734
And his facial injuries are restricting
movement, and the swelling...

07:57.801 --> 07:59.267
I don't know. I can't tell if he's lying...

07:59.300 --> 08:00.901
Cabe McNeil?

08:00.968 --> 08:04.133
She's a kid. You know?
Why would you do that to her?

08:04.200 --> 08:07.200
She's a child. My child.

08:07.267 --> 08:08.467
You know what that makes you, right?

08:08.534 --> 08:11.801
That makes you a rapist,
that's what that makes you.

08:11.834 --> 08:14.300
Mr. Reed, I know... I consider your pain sincere.

08:14.334 --> 08:16.634
Our daughters go to the same school.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.067
If someone came after my Emily,

08:18.133 --> 08:20.300
I'd be as angry and
distressed as you are.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.467
You have no idea how this feels.

08:22.501 --> 08:24.834
That's true. But I can see it in your face.

08:26.167 --> 08:28.767
Go home. Don't make it worse for yourself.

08:28.834 --> 08:30.601
Go home to your daughter.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.467
Who are you?

08:33.501 --> 08:35.801
Just a bystander. I don't have a dog in this fight.

08:35.833 --> 08:38.734
Don't just stand there.

08:38.801 --> 08:41.400
Uh, get your son out of here.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.167
Just go home, Mr. Reed.

08:49.701 --> 08:52.267
Just go home, sir.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.033
Well, that was interesting.

09:10.534 --> 09:11.567
Hi.
Hi.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.667
Jamie Cowley.

09:12.701 --> 09:15.033
Dr. Gillian Foster. This is Eli Loker.

09:15.067 --> 09:16.601
Hi.
Hello.

09:16.667 --> 09:18.367
Here's a copy of the court order

09:18.400 --> 09:19.868
Allowing us to visit your compound

09:19.901 --> 09:21.200
and conduct our research.

09:21.234 --> 09:22.868
It gives us 3 days to observe and interview

09:22.901 --> 09:24.300
the members of your church,

09:24.367 --> 09:27.000
and we will come and go
as quietly as we can.

09:27.067 --> 09:31.667
So, how many disciples live on your compound?

09:31.734 --> 09:35.334
I share the property
with about
150 other believers.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.567
Well, the IRS has had difficulty
determining an exact number.

09:39.634 --> 09:42.767
The children born into your group
don't get social security numbers.

09:42.834 --> 09:44.834
They don't need one to know God.

09:44.901 --> 09:46.801
Oh, and God... would that be you?

09:46.868 --> 09:49.434
The Supreme Court is very clear.

09:49.501 --> 09:53.434
The IRS cannot judge any
church's religious tenets.

09:53.501 --> 09:57.934
Yeah. Only whether your followers'
beliefs are sincere and genuine.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.167
So that's where we come in.

10:00.234 --> 10:03.968
You have over 30 houses
on your compound registered

10:04.033 --> 10:05.300
as individual churches.

10:05.367 --> 10:08.634
Well, God is everywhere.

10:08.701 --> 10:11.467
30 churches... that means
30 different tax exemptions.

10:11.534 --> 10:12.801
The IRS calls it fraud.

10:12.868 --> 10:16.934
Mmm. Only if they can prove that

10:17.000 --> 10:21.701
any of my followers
aren't true believers.

10:21.767 --> 10:23.767
Well, you seem pretty
confident that they all are.

10:23.801 --> 10:28.434
Take a look around. Keep an open mind.

10:28.467 --> 10:30.200
You might find yourself moved.

10:30.267 --> 10:31.767
Come on. I'll show you around.

10:31.801 --> 10:35.000
So, other than you, I've only seen

10:35.067 --> 10:36.334
2 other men your age here.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.000
Mm-hmm. Those are Chris and Ken.

10:38.067 --> 10:39.834
They helped found the church.

10:39.901 --> 10:41.167
When our boys turn 16,

10:41.234 --> 10:43.067
we encourage them to explore the world,

10:43.133 --> 10:44.767
though they're always welcome to return.

10:44.801 --> 10:47.434
And the women tend to stay.

10:47.467 --> 10:50.200
They care for us and vice versa.

10:50.267 --> 10:52.200
I'm curious. How many of
these children are yours?

10:52.267 --> 10:54.934
Spiritually, they're all my children.

10:54.968 --> 10:58.868
Biologically, 12.

10:58.934 --> 11:02.634
And in your materials,

11:02.667 --> 11:03.934
you claim that you're a prophet,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.434
that God is going to teach, through you,

11:06.501 --> 11:08.200
how to live a fulfilled life?

11:08.267 --> 11:10.267
That's right.

11:10.334 --> 11:12.167
So...

11:12.234 --> 11:13.767
It's pretty intense, huh?

11:13.834 --> 11:16.100
How exactly do you communicate with God?

11:16.167 --> 11:18.667
How does anyone?

11:18.734 --> 11:22.834
Through prayer, sometimes
by looking into a child's eyes.

11:22.901 --> 11:25.100
I can see that you need convincing.

11:25.167 --> 11:27.067
Why don't you stop by my
sermon, see for yourself?

11:27.133 --> 11:28.501
You'll have to excuse me.

11:28.567 --> 11:30.601
I have a realization class to teach,

11:30.667 --> 11:32.133
but feel free to talk to anyone.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.100
We're happy to cooperate.

11:38.601 --> 11:40.634
We're not here to judge, remember?

11:40.701 --> 11:43.300
How can I not judge someone
who creates their own harem

11:43.367 --> 11:46.033
and tosses out the competition
when they hit puberty?

11:46.100 --> 11:49.200
Judge him? How can I copy him?

11:49.267 --> 11:52.367
Look, it's weird, I know,
but it's a free country,

11:52.434 --> 11:55.067
and if the earth mamas want
to split, there is no gate.

11:55.133 --> 11:58.000
No one's getting hurt.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.534
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

12:04.367 --> 12:07.067
Is Susan the kind of girl that
would make up a story like this?

12:07.133 --> 12:08.734
I don't... I don't know her very well.

12:08.801 --> 12:11.234
What kind of things do you hear goes on

12:11.300 --> 12:12.934
at these frat parties, then?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.634
I've never been to one,
so I couldn't tell you.

12:18.501 --> 12:20.067
You wouldn't be dodging
my questions, would you?

12:20.133 --> 12:24.033
No. I'm... I'm not dodging your questions.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.033
Ok.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.868
So the girls who go to these parties, right,

12:28.934 --> 12:31.767
are they... do they lie about their age,

12:31.834 --> 12:33.534
or are they on about it?

12:33.601 --> 12:35.801
Dad, I told you, I've never been to one.

12:35.868 --> 12:37.100
But...

12:37.167 --> 12:39.334
But what?

12:39.400 --> 12:41.567
No, you tell me.

12:44.334 --> 12:47.000
Ok. I've been to A&M a couple of times,

12:47.067 --> 12:50.033
but just... just like, bars, you know?

12:50.067 --> 12:51.701
Excuse me?

12:51.734 --> 12:54.067
It's not a big deal. Uh, where's mom?

12:54.133 --> 12:55.467
She'll be home in a minute.

12:55.534 --> 12:56.734
She drives like a quaker.

12:56.801 --> 12:58.701
Just... I'd never go to a frat party, ok?

12:58.734 --> 13:00.534
Those things get crazy.

13:00.567 --> 13:02.834
What, as opposed to a pub?

13:02.901 --> 13:06.167
Not a pub, dad. A bar. A college bar.

13:06.234 --> 13:09.434
And one with bouncers
and a million other people.

13:09.501 --> 13:12.133
It's totally different from a frat party.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.701
And I mean, I don't even go to drink.

13:13.767 --> 13:16.434
I just want to listen to the music.

13:16.501 --> 13:18.234
Really?

13:18.267 --> 13:19.968
Really.
Ah.

13:20.033 --> 13:23.067
So how'd you get in, then? Eh?

13:23.100 --> 13:25.167
Um... what?

13:27.601 --> 13:28.834
What's in the drawer?

13:28.901 --> 13:30.167
Nothing.
Hmm?

13:30.234 --> 13:32.267
Hmm?
Mm-hmm.

13:32.334 --> 13:33.667
What's in the drawer, darling?

13:33.734 --> 13:34.701
Nothing.

13:34.767 --> 13:36.000
What's in the... what's in the...

13:36.067 --> 13:37.767
Excuse me. Excuse me.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.367
Dad, please.

13:39.434 --> 13:41.267
Dad, that's private.

13:41.334 --> 13:42.400
Dad, stop. Excuse me.

13:42.467 --> 13:43.434
Excuse me. Dad, that's...

13:43.467 --> 13:45.467
That's... that's private, dad?

13:45.534 --> 13:46.567
Oh, really?

13:46.634 --> 13:48.033
That's such a violation.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.801
Yeah, well, your mom's a lawyer. Sue me.

13:50.868 --> 13:53.734
Come on. You have no right to do this.

13:53.801 --> 13:56.567
Dad, I'm serious. Come on. Come on.

14:03.534 --> 14:05.567
What are these, Emily?

14:06.968 --> 14:09.267
Or should I say...

14:09.300 --> 14:12.300
Kami Schwartz?

14:12.367 --> 14:15.100
Everyone my age has fake IDs.

14:15.133 --> 14:19.133
Right, and your social calendar demands 2, does it?

14:22.667 --> 14:25.501
Dad, come on. That's just a jewelry box.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.667
Oh. What'd I miss?

14:29.734 --> 14:33.000
I hope, for your sake,
these are just tic-tacs.

14:43.534 --> 14:47.000
You're using birth control pills, eh?

14:48.801 --> 14:50.901
Do you realize there's consequences
for your actions?

14:50.968 --> 14:54.100
There's consequences to going to frat parties.

14:54.167 --> 14:56.067
There's consequences to
hanging out with older boys.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.567
There's consequences to having these.

14:57.634 --> 15:00.534
Well, there's consequences
to not having those, too.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.667
You just read me.

15:03.734 --> 15:06.567
You swore you would never
do that, and you just did.

15:08.234 --> 15:09.634
Oi!

15:09.701 --> 15:12.701
Don't go through my things, ever again.

15:19.167 --> 15:20.701
Well, that went well.

15:20.767 --> 15:22.300
Don't be mad at her.

15:22.367 --> 15:25.701
I'm not mad at her. I'm
mad at you for not telling me.

15:25.767 --> 15:27.601
She feels like she can't talk
to you about these things.

15:27.667 --> 15:28.601
Why?

15:28.667 --> 15:30.033
Well, because when you read her,

15:30.100 --> 15:31.367
she feels like you're judging her.

15:31.434 --> 15:33.133
I'm not judging her!

15:33.200 --> 15:34.968
That's rubbish.
I'm not judging her.

15:35.033 --> 15:38.300
Well, did you know that some of her
friends are already having sex?

15:38.367 --> 15:40.300
Which ones?

15:40.367 --> 15:43.167
Why, so you can forbid her from seeing them?

15:46.300 --> 15:49.300
Come on. You know what we
were like when we first met.

15:50.801 --> 15:52.067
Look, Cal, I know in your work

15:52.133 --> 15:53.567
you uncover all kinds of terrible things

15:53.634 --> 15:54.834
that people do every day,

15:54.901 --> 15:57.467
but you can't put all of
those fears onto Emily.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.868
And look. She's not on the pill yet,
and I hope it stays that way,

16:01.934 --> 16:05.501
but I think it's best that she
have them for when she is ready.

16:09.334 --> 16:10.801
Bloody hell.

16:12.033 --> 16:16.701
24 years old. Are you attracted to her?

16:19.167 --> 16:20.901
Sure.

16:23.968 --> 16:26.334
19.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.834
What does she do for you?

16:27.901 --> 16:31.167
Pretty hot.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.501
18.

16:36.334 --> 16:37.434
Yes.

16:37.501 --> 16:39.968
16 years old?

16:41.300 --> 16:43.467
Find her attractive?

16:46.467 --> 16:47.734
No.

16:47.801 --> 16:50.734
15 years old?

16:50.801 --> 16:52.968
Find her attractive?

16:55.567 --> 16:56.901
No.

16:59.567 --> 17:01.501
Ok. When I showed him the photograph

17:01.567 --> 17:03.501
of the 24-year-old in the brown panties,

17:03.567 --> 17:07.800
he subconsciously licked his
lip, and his pupils dilated.

17:07.867 --> 17:09.634
These are all signs of arousal.

17:09.701 --> 17:11.867
Now, this is his response when I showed him

17:11.934 --> 17:14.400
the 15-year-old, the 16-year-old,

17:14.467 --> 17:17.800
and asked him if he was attracted.
He said "no."

17:17.867 --> 17:19.133
You lied, Cabe.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.666
My son is a good boy.

17:20.733 --> 17:22.400
No, he is a good boy. He's
actually... he's a very good boy.

17:22.467 --> 17:25.200
He knows he's not supposed to be
attracted to a 15-year-old girl

17:25.267 --> 17:27.367
'cause society tells him it's wrong.

17:27.434 --> 17:29.868
But I mean, look at her.

17:29.934 --> 17:32.801
Ample breasts, slim waist,

17:32.868 --> 17:35.167
ass that won't quit.

17:35.234 --> 17:36.567
Cal.

17:36.634 --> 17:38.567
All physical attributes

17:38.634 --> 17:42.534
that a heterosexual male is
biologically wired to desire.

17:42.601 --> 17:45.267
There's nothing wrong in wanting her,

17:45.334 --> 17:48.701
especially since she's 22 years of age.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.133
I lied, sorry.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.934
Now, for the good news.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.434
When I asked Cabe if he had ever knowingly

17:56.501 --> 17:59.434
had sex with an underage girl,

17:59.501 --> 18:01.367
he said no.

18:02.534 --> 18:04.934
And he was telling the truth.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.267
Out in the world,

18:08.334 --> 18:11.901
7-year-olds can get carpal tunnel

18:11.968 --> 18:16.400
from texting and playing
video games all day long.

18:16.467 --> 18:19.234
And our children grow their own food,

18:19.300 --> 18:21.234
make crafts, become self sufficient.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.501
Hear his word choice?

18:22.567 --> 18:23.767
What's next?

18:23.834 --> 18:24.868
"Out in the world?"

18:24.934 --> 18:26.601
He defines his followers' universe.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.801
He compares himself to buddha
and other biblical figures.

18:30.868 --> 18:32.634
You got a point.

18:32.701 --> 18:35.367
No, but his point is irrelevant, all right?

18:35.434 --> 18:38.133
He's using details with special context,

18:38.200 --> 18:40.534
like underneath that huge oak tree

18:40.601 --> 18:42.234
and behind the work shop.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.767
It's contextual embedding,

18:43.834 --> 18:45.033
a sign he's telling the truth.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.434
So he really believes he's a prophet.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.534
His religious beliefs are legit.

18:49.601 --> 18:52.901
Well, to him and them.

18:52.968 --> 18:55.801
But see that? Not her.

18:59.133 --> 19:00.400
Why the rush to see us?

19:00.467 --> 19:03.067
So you and your expert can sign these.

19:03.133 --> 19:04.400
What are they?

19:04.467 --> 19:05.734
Clearance from the state and federal government

19:05.801 --> 19:07.901
for you to watch child pornography.

19:07.968 --> 19:10.734
Your client secretly taped his
sex romp with Susan Reed,

19:10.801 --> 19:13.000
and then he put it online for everyone to see.

19:13.067 --> 19:16.400
That's enticing a minor and making
and distributing child porn.

19:16.467 --> 19:19.367
What was a simple misdemeanor is now 3 felonies.

19:24.868 --> 19:27.467
All right.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.167
Hey, I hear the moaning stopped.

19:29.234 --> 19:31.400
You stopped banging.
Let us in.

19:38.701 --> 19:40.334
The forensic team traced the source

19:40.400 --> 19:43.667
to the wireless router in the frat house.

19:43.734 --> 19:46.868
Susan reed also swears she
told Cabe how old she was.

19:46.934 --> 19:49.434
Cabe may have fooled you.

19:49.501 --> 19:51.267
I was thinking he was just
a good kid in a bad spot.

19:51.334 --> 19:52.267
He is a good kid.

19:52.334 --> 19:53.601
Your case is falling apart,

19:53.667 --> 19:55.367
so just let me send this kid where he belongs.

19:55.434 --> 19:57.300
Why, because he's black
and he slept with a white girl,

19:57.367 --> 19:58.467
he belongs in jail?

19:58.534 --> 20:00.467
No, because she was 16,
and he put it online.

20:00.534 --> 20:01.801
I resent the suggestion
that this has anything...

20:01.868 --> 20:03.234
Oh, Jay, don't play victim.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.567
Come on. I know your track record,

20:04.634 --> 20:06.167
and I know how you treat black defendants.

20:06.234 --> 20:07.567
And I know how you treated me in law school.

20:07.634 --> 20:09.367
I had one white parent, one black parent,

20:09.434 --> 20:10.801
and I was the only Brown student there.

20:10.868 --> 20:12.467
And you just looked down
your nose at me all 3 years.

20:12.534 --> 20:14.767
I'll see you at the grand jury.

20:22.068 --> 20:23.368
Why'd you made the film?

20:23.368 --> 20:24.068
I didn't.

20:24.234 --> 20:25.300
Yeah, but you know
who made the film, right?

20:25.367 --> 20:26.234
And you put it online anyway?

20:26.300 --> 20:27.767
I didn't make any film.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.000
This is the first time I've heard of it.

20:29.067 --> 20:30.400
You knew she was 16.
No!

20:30.467 --> 20:32.434
Yeah, she told you that she was 16,

20:32.501 --> 20:33.767
and you brought her home anyway.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.200
She never said she was 16!

20:36.267 --> 20:37.234
Dr. Lightman?

20:37.300 --> 20:39.601
Can you come into the lab, please?

20:45.033 --> 20:46.300
What?

20:46.367 --> 20:48.334
Look at this.

20:50.067 --> 20:51.501
You knew she was 16.

20:51.567 --> 20:55.100
Yeah. Yeah. She told you that she was 16,

20:55.200 --> 20:56.567
and you brought her home anyway.

20:56.634 --> 20:58.734
She never said she was 16.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.434
You see what I see?
Yeah.

21:04.501 --> 21:06.701
A man who needs some sleep.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.067
A guy who's losing control over his emotions.

21:09.133 --> 21:13.067
This case involves a girl Emily's
age who goes to her school...

21:13.133 --> 21:18.400
Maybe you should let me talk to him.

21:18.467 --> 21:19.567
Maybe you should remember
who's name's on the door.

21:19.634 --> 21:21.200
She might be right.

21:21.267 --> 21:23.267
Oh, says the woman who's bringing up

21:23.334 --> 21:24.801
personal gripes from law school.

21:24.868 --> 21:26.100
You didn't even let him answer

21:26.167 --> 21:27.267
before you hit him with another question.

21:27.334 --> 21:28.501
How can you tell if he's telling the truth

21:28.567 --> 21:29.734
If you don't even allow for a clear read?

21:29.801 --> 21:32.167
He is telling the truth.

21:32.234 --> 21:34.267
He doesn't know anything about the film,

21:34.334 --> 21:36.567
unless you saw some signs of aggression

21:36.634 --> 21:39.501
I missed during my particularly
unprofessional session.

21:39.567 --> 21:41.767
He's being honest.

21:43.567 --> 21:44.667
Are we done here?

21:44.734 --> 21:47.000
Yeah. Good. Come on.

21:47.067 --> 21:48.834
Where?

21:48.901 --> 21:50.667
Back to school.

21:54.234 --> 21:56.400
Aw, hell no.

21:56.467 --> 21:59.334
Hey, I'm sorry, old man, but Shady
Acres is down the street.

21:59.400 --> 22:03.167
No, no, no. I used to run this place back in the day.

22:03.234 --> 22:06.100
Look, see? Look. Class of '85.

22:06.167 --> 22:08.634
Uh, blue and gold, proud and bold.

22:08.701 --> 22:10.534
You were Theta house?
Yeah. Hang on.

22:10.601 --> 22:12.334
Yeah. There you go.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.701
That's me right there.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.534
That's you? Damn.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.601
Yeah. Father time's a bitch.

22:17.667 --> 22:18.868
Yeah. Enjoy the party, brother.

22:18.934 --> 22:21.934
Yeah. Uh, Keg's in the kitchen, right?

22:22.000 --> 22:23.601
In the kitchen.

22:23.667 --> 22:25.701
* Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh *

22:25.767 --> 22:27.467
* look how I made 'em off *

22:27.534 --> 22:30.033
* in the south, it's crunk, in the bay, it's hyphy *

22:30.100 --> 22:32.534
* but in this hip-hop, there's nobody really like me *

22:32.601 --> 22:34.367
* and real talk, I'm cool with that *

22:34.434 --> 22:35.701
* for some, it's hard to swallow *

22:35.767 --> 22:36.968
*but I'm true with that *

22:37.033 --> 22:39.033
* straight to the top, I'm doin' that *

22:39.100 --> 22:41.634
* when I first heard the beat, I was movin' that *

22:43.200 --> 22:45.167
I used to strip.

22:51.467 --> 22:53.667
So this is college.

22:53.734 --> 22:55.501
Guess I didn't miss much.

22:55.567 --> 22:57.734
What did you find out?

22:57.801 --> 23:00.567
Uh, most of these guys
just talk a big game.

23:00.634 --> 23:03.567
Once you mention anything about
aggression, anything about voyeurism,

23:03.634 --> 23:05.067
they pull back.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.501
Actually, between you and me,

23:06.567 --> 23:07.901
I don't think any one of these guys

23:07.968 --> 23:09.901
could throw a decent hump at me.

23:09.968 --> 23:11.767
You drunk?

23:13.934 --> 23:16.234
Did you see anyone who, you know,

23:16.300 --> 23:19.567
might be inclined to film and distribute a sex act?

23:19.634 --> 23:21.934
Yep. 3 guys showed signs of arousal

23:22.000 --> 23:25.100
when voyeuristic topics came up.

23:25.167 --> 23:27.267
Round them up.

23:27.334 --> 23:28.767
All right.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.234
The simplicity of our lives,

23:31.301 --> 23:33.201
the simplicity of Jamie's teachings,

23:33.267 --> 23:34.767
it's all very...

23:34.833 --> 23:35.733
Simple?

23:35.800 --> 23:38.767
So Jamie's belief that he's a prophet

23:38.833 --> 23:41.267
That can lead his followers to a better life,

23:41.334 --> 23:43.201
do you share that belief, Catherine?

23:43.267 --> 23:46.867
Of course.

23:55.833 --> 23:59.733
Aww. Isn't that sweet? Did you make this?

23:59.800 --> 24:02.534
What does it say?

24:02.601 --> 24:04.601
They can't read?

24:04.668 --> 24:08.234
Jamie's homeschooling stresses
ethics over standard academics.

24:08.301 --> 24:10.501
They can't read, and from what I can tell,

24:10.568 --> 24:13.467
they spend all day making
crafts for Jamie to sell?

24:13.534 --> 24:15.467
Do you think that's healthy?

24:15.534 --> 24:17.067
Not why we're here.

24:17.134 --> 24:19.367
We'll take care of our children our way.

24:19.434 --> 24:21.067
You take care of yours your way.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.568
Men fathering children year-round,

24:27.634 --> 24:28.900
kids not getting educated.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.634
Yeah, like a quarter of the U.S. population.

24:30.700 --> 24:31.900
This doesn't bother you?

24:31.967 --> 24:33.668
These children are not being cared for.

24:33.733 --> 24:35.334
I mean, there are people out
there who'd want them,

24:35.401 --> 24:36.634
who'd love them.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.833
We're here to find tax fraud... no more, no less.

24:38.900 --> 24:41.167
And no, wacky religions, they don't bother me,

24:41.234 --> 24:44.201
because they're no wackier
than the mainstream ones.

24:44.267 --> 24:46.434
Do you really believe that
there's a man in the clouds

24:46.501 --> 24:49.334
who will solve your problems
if you make a wish to him?

24:49.401 --> 24:52.100
So being a scientist means
I can't believe in God?

24:52.167 --> 24:53.934
Well, last I checked,

24:54.000 --> 24:55.100
talking to invisible people

24:55.167 --> 24:56.733
is usually diagnosed as schizophrenia.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.067
Look at her son.

24:58.134 --> 24:59.733
His body language is very open...

24:59.800 --> 25:01.767
his arms behind his back,
standing off to the side.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.267
Waiting where he knows we have to pass.

25:04.334 --> 25:06.167
Yeah.

25:09.467 --> 25:11.434
I didn't catch your name before.

25:11.501 --> 25:12.634
I'm Zack.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.867
I'm Gillian.

25:14.934 --> 25:17.833
Is there something that you want to tell us, Zack?

25:17.900 --> 25:21.934
My mom doesn't believe in any of this...

25:22.000 --> 25:24.401
not in Jamie, his church, none of it.

25:24.467 --> 25:26.434
Then why does she stay here?

25:26.501 --> 25:29.267
Oh, if she tries to go,

25:29.334 --> 25:30.833
Jamie will take us from her.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.234
So... excucuse me.

25:39.301 --> 25:41.934
So, uh, this would be my room.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.267
I see.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.034
Ohh.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.267
So, uh, what's the plans?

25:47.334 --> 25:50.601
No plan.

25:50.668 --> 25:52.134
You ready to party, boys?

25:52.201 --> 25:53.967
Take a hike, dude.

25:55.634 --> 25:59.000
Which one of you made the sex film? Who was it?

26:02.934 --> 26:04.100
There's our man.

26:04.167 --> 26:06.100
Yeah. You two, hop it.

26:06.167 --> 26:07.967
Go on. On your way.

26:12.267 --> 26:13.634
What's your name?

26:13.700 --> 26:15.301
Wayne.

26:15.367 --> 26:17.700
Wayne what?

26:17.767 --> 26:19.501
Wayne Harkey.

26:19.568 --> 26:20.833
Oh. Hello, Wayne.

26:20.900 --> 26:24.367
So, where's the sex film?

26:25.467 --> 26:29.234
Look, you made a film

26:29.301 --> 26:30.833
with an underage girl.

26:30.900 --> 26:32.934
If I have to ask you again,
I'm going to cuff you.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.100
You understand me, Wayne?

26:34.167 --> 26:36.000
Yeah.

26:40.634 --> 26:41.568
I didn't know what to do with it.

26:41.634 --> 26:44.067
Or you couldn't stop watching it.

26:44.134 --> 26:46.934
I didn't know she was in high school,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.767
and I did not make that film, all right?

26:48.833 --> 26:50.100
I found it.

26:50.167 --> 26:52.267
I just... I posted it online as a joke

26:52.334 --> 26:53.401
to punk Cabe.

26:53.467 --> 26:55.167
Real funny.

26:55.234 --> 26:56.467
Look, I came up here for some beers,

26:56.534 --> 26:58.634
and it was sitting on the desk.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.100
I found it, all right?

27:00.167 --> 27:01.434
The sex stuff was already on it.

27:01.501 --> 27:02.767
I posted it, and I just...

27:02.833 --> 27:04.467
I went outside for a brew.

27:07.067 --> 27:09.000
I believe you.

27:09.067 --> 27:11.201
Go on. Sod off.

27:14.167 --> 27:15.967
What?

27:16.034 --> 27:18.568
Give me the camera.

27:18.634 --> 27:21.134
Hello?

27:21.201 --> 27:23.034
Emily?

27:32.267 --> 27:34.867
I want to know how a video of you

27:34.934 --> 27:36.833
ended up on a camera with a sex film on it

27:36.900 --> 27:38.334
that I found at a fraternity house...

27:38.401 --> 27:40.668
Look at me, Emily. Look at me. Look at me!

27:42.301 --> 27:43.900
Now, I found it at a fraternity house

27:43.967 --> 27:46.167
that you told me you never went to.

27:46.234 --> 27:47.367
I didn't go there.

27:47.434 --> 27:48.800
How did you end up on this camera

27:48.867 --> 27:49.900
with these girls?

27:49.967 --> 27:51.900
It was outside school
after a basketball game,

27:51.967 --> 27:53.900
not at some college party.

27:53.967 --> 27:57.467
See, I don't know what to believe
anymore. I really don't.

27:57.534 --> 28:02.367
You've got fake IDs, Emily, and birth control pills.

28:02.434 --> 28:04.034
What else are you keeping from me?

28:04.100 --> 28:06.301
Look. Look at the date.

28:06.367 --> 28:10.201
That was before the party,
which I wasn't even at.

28:10.267 --> 28:11.668
Well, then, who are the other girls on the video?

28:11.733 --> 28:14.833
That's Dori and Kate. They're seniors

28:14.900 --> 28:16.467
that I hang out with once in a while.

28:16.534 --> 28:18.568
And that's Kate's camera.

28:18.634 --> 28:20.000
They're really cool,

28:20.067 --> 28:21.267
and there are only a couple of juniors

28:21.334 --> 28:23.867
that they'll even talk to. So...

28:23.934 --> 28:25.867
Let alone bring along to frat parties.

28:25.934 --> 28:27.167
I've never gone with them.

28:27.234 --> 28:28.967
Yet?

28:30.401 --> 28:31.867
No.

28:36.733 --> 28:39.867
Do you believe that Jamie Cowley's a prophet?

28:39.934 --> 28:44.534
I was 19 and a user when I met him.

28:44.601 --> 28:48.201
Jamie was handsome, and...

28:48.267 --> 28:49.767
he cleaned me up.

28:49.833 --> 28:53.601
He'll keep my kids.

28:55.467 --> 28:58.668
And I cannot lose my babies.

28:58.733 --> 29:01.534
Look, I hate to bring up the obvious.

29:01.601 --> 29:03.534
We have to report her to the IRS.

29:03.601 --> 29:06.100
She clearly doesn't believe in the church.

29:06.167 --> 29:08.100
Her home is registered as a place of worship.

29:08.167 --> 29:10.000
Yeah. Only because Cowley makes her.

29:10.067 --> 29:12.267
Well, that's irrelevant. We just report the facts.

29:12.334 --> 29:13.534
Ok. Ok. Fact,

29:13.601 --> 29:16.534
we tell the government,
she's arrested for tax fraud.

29:16.601 --> 29:18.000
Fact, she'll lose her children.

29:18.067 --> 29:19.668
Fact, I'm not about to serve her up

29:19.733 --> 29:21.100
when I can deliver Cowley instead.

29:21.167 --> 29:23.034
Fact, I'm not going to lie to
the federal government

29:23.100 --> 29:24.301
about our findings. I'm not going to lie.

29:24.367 --> 29:25.967
I'm going to tell them
exactly what's going on there.

29:26.034 --> 29:27.301
Laws are being violated.

29:27.367 --> 29:28.534
We need to get those kids out of there.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.401
So you're suggesting another waco.

29:30.467 --> 29:31.733
You just bust down the door and...

29:31.800 --> 29:34.668
Women and children who
are just too scared to leave?

29:34.733 --> 29:38.100
Well, they're not just going to
go in there and round them up.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.201
We were hired to pursue
the tax fraud angle.

29:40.267 --> 29:41.367
Let's do our job.

29:41.434 --> 29:43.634
Except Cowley believes his delusions.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.000
They won't be able to prosecute.

29:45.067 --> 29:47.634
All we'll get is maybe a few scared women.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.800
Then that's all we'll get.

29:58.034 --> 29:59.367
Which one of you's Kate?

29:59.434 --> 30:00.733
And you are?

30:00.800 --> 30:03.234
The man who found your camera.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.568
Where did you get that?

30:04.634 --> 30:05.800
Where did you leave it?

30:05.867 --> 30:07.534
It's mine. Just give it back.

30:07.601 --> 30:09.800
Well, after you've answered a few questions.

30:09.867 --> 30:12.401
Whatever, stranger danger.

30:12.467 --> 30:14.668
Give me back my camera, or I'll call the cops.

30:14.733 --> 30:16.100
Go ahead. You can tell them all about

30:16.167 --> 30:19.201
filming your friend Susan while
she was in bed with Cabe.

30:24.833 --> 30:26.934
Which one of you recorded it?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.934
Neither of us. Susan did it.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.034
Susan did it.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.934
Oh. At least that's the truth.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.934
You know, I told you we should
have never brought her along.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.267
She was being such a baby about

30:37.334 --> 30:38.668
the whole thing.
What whole thing?

30:38.733 --> 30:41.634
It's a lot more comfortable

30:41.700 --> 30:43.301
talking to us than it is the cops.

30:43.367 --> 30:46.634
A bunch of us made a pact

30:46.700 --> 30:48.467
not to have our first time with a college guy be

30:48.534 --> 30:49.800
when we were in college.

30:49.867 --> 30:52.767
High school boys are tools.

30:52.833 --> 30:56.601
You go to A&M to have sex with college boys.

30:56.668 --> 30:58.668
And we picked a few juniors

30:58.733 --> 31:00.700
we thought were cool enough to hang.

31:00.767 --> 31:02.867
Susan was, like, totally petrified,

31:02.934 --> 31:06.334
so I gave her my camera.
You know, for proof.

31:06.401 --> 31:07.767
You made her record it?

31:07.833 --> 31:10.700
Duh. We made a pact.

31:10.767 --> 31:12.034
We needed proof.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.000
After the deed, she totally wigged out.

31:14.067 --> 31:16.467
She ran out of the room and left it there.

31:17.900 --> 31:20.134
You feel bad about any of this?

31:20.201 --> 31:21.967
No.

31:22.034 --> 31:23.668
It's just sex.

31:23.733 --> 31:25.733
Now, give up the camera.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.434
It cost my dad, like, $400.

31:27.501 --> 31:31.000
No. You tell him it's held by
county in evidence, all right?

31:32.134 --> 31:33.900
In fact, the cops, they'll be by later today,

31:33.967 --> 31:35.833
and they'll tell him themselves.

31:35.900 --> 31:38.634
Hey.

31:38.700 --> 31:40.201
My daughter's Emily Lightman, all right?

31:40.267 --> 31:42.800
You two stay away from her, all right?

31:42.867 --> 31:44.134
Whatever.

31:44.201 --> 31:45.934
You stay away from her.

31:57.034 --> 31:58.867
Hey. Mr. Reed.

31:58.934 --> 32:01.867
You defend that boy. You work with his lawyer.

32:01.934 --> 32:03.800
And now, you have the nerve to come to my home?

32:03.867 --> 32:04.967
No. I know it's hard for you.

32:05.034 --> 32:06.400
I don't want to make it any harder.

32:06.467 --> 32:07.567
You know what's been hard?

32:07.634 --> 32:08.834
Let me tell you what's hard.

32:08.901 --> 32:11.167
My wife dying 11 months ago

32:11.234 --> 32:12.467
because the insurance carrier said

32:12.533 --> 32:14.600
the treatment she needs is experimental.

32:14.667 --> 32:17.800
My plant shutting down so some
guy in Paraguay can have my job,

32:17.867 --> 32:22.234
my baby girl on the internet
because some animal filmed...

32:22.301 --> 32:23.800
I promise you, it's not my intention

32:23.867 --> 32:27.101
to bring you any more pain, all right?

32:27.167 --> 32:29.201
Right, Susan?

32:30.533 --> 32:32.600
I spoke to Kate and Dori.

32:32.667 --> 32:34.800
I think you need to talk to your dad.

32:34.867 --> 32:37.368
I think he deserves the truth.

32:42.101 --> 32:44.400
There's stuff I haven't told you.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.934
Hey, you guys.

32:51.001 --> 32:52.667
Is your mom home?

32:55.167 --> 32:56.667
Catherine...

32:59.368 --> 33:02.167
Hello, Ms. Foster, Mr. Loker.

33:02.234 --> 33:04.268
I called the IRS today.

33:04.334 --> 33:06.734
They assured me that you
wouldn't overstep your bounds,

33:06.800 --> 33:08.734
that they'd hate to see my civil rights violated.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.500
But I'm sure that that's not your intention.

33:11.567 --> 33:12.967
Of course not.

33:14.433 --> 33:18.834
I can see that you have a
fondness for children, Gillian,

33:18.901 --> 33:21.101
but I sense that you have none of your own.

33:22.533 --> 33:27.234
Perhaps the animosity I feel
from you is misdirected at me.

33:27.301 --> 33:31.567
My seed flourishes...

33:31.634 --> 33:33.467
Hey, buddy.

33:35.834 --> 33:40.268
While yours, well, doesn't.

33:44.167 --> 33:45.301
I can help you.

33:45.368 --> 33:46.901
You and I can pray together.

33:46.967 --> 33:48.867
Many of the female members

33:48.934 --> 33:50.767
couldn't conceive in the outside world,

33:50.834 --> 33:53.500
but when they came here, we prayed,

33:53.567 --> 33:55.134
and they conceived.

33:55.201 --> 33:58.934
Your problem isn't biological. It's spiritual.

33:59.001 --> 34:02.034
I don't need you to help me pray.

34:02.101 --> 34:04.034
Today's the last day of your court order.

34:04.101 --> 34:07.500
Gather your things. You're
no longer welcome here.

34:11.867 --> 34:14.766
He must have looked you
up online or something.

34:14.833 --> 34:19.034
It's a cold read. It's a carnival trick.

34:22.734 --> 34:25.101
Ok.

34:25.167 --> 34:29.433
I've taken all the facts of
this case into consideration.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.067
And I've decided to drop all
charges against Cabe McNeil.

34:32.134 --> 34:33.268
What?

34:33.333 --> 34:35.400
I'm sorry, but the extenuating circumstances

34:35.467 --> 34:36.600
of this case are such...

34:36.667 --> 34:38.333
He violated my daughter.
I mean, she's a kid.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.167
He's a 22-year-old man.

34:40.234 --> 34:41.766
He had a reasonable belief
that she was of age.

34:41.833 --> 34:44.867
It was filmed! It's out in the world forever!

34:44.934 --> 34:47.001
The only one who gets punished is my daughter?

34:47.067 --> 34:48.167
Come on!

34:48.234 --> 34:49.333
Mr. Reed. It was a tough decision.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.967
Oh, this is the way the system always works.

34:51.034 --> 34:54.001
You're the prosecutor. Do your job!

34:54.067 --> 34:57.134
The system has to make someone pay.

34:57.201 --> 34:59.634
My job gives me prosecutorial discretion,

34:59.700 --> 35:01.134
and I am using it here.

35:01.201 --> 35:03.934
Your daughter went to the party
with intent of having sex.

35:04.001 --> 35:05.368
She lied about her age.

35:05.433 --> 35:06.634
She filmed it.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.034
She's the victim!

35:08.101 --> 35:10.901
In this case, Cabe McNeil is a victim, too.

35:13.101 --> 35:15.433
Come on, Susan.

35:17.167 --> 35:19.067
Excuse me.

35:19.134 --> 35:21.533
Jay, I don't know what to say.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.134
How about "I'm sorry"?

35:23.201 --> 35:26.433
Could you please get my
daughter's jacket now? Now?

35:28.934 --> 35:30.600
I'm not a bigot, Zoe.

35:30.667 --> 35:32.067
I filed the charges because I follow the law.

35:32.134 --> 35:35.834
And the only reason I had a
problem with you in school was

35:35.901 --> 35:37.400
you made law review, and I didn't.

35:37.467 --> 35:39.867
Hey, Jay, I am sorry.

35:39.934 --> 35:41.533
Good job on the case.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.934
Next time, I'm knocking you in the dirt.

35:44.001 --> 35:46.433
Mr. Reed. Hold on a minute.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.800
Hold on. Hold on a sec.

35:50.634 --> 35:53.234
I think I know what you're going to do.

35:53.301 --> 35:55.001
I'm fine now.

35:55.067 --> 35:57.101
Yeah, well, your hand says otherwise.

35:57.167 --> 36:01.167
Look, don't go off to Cabe, all right?

36:01.234 --> 36:04.533
It will just make matters worse for yourself.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.467
Think about your daughter.

36:10.368 --> 36:13.001
She's all I'm thinking about.

36:24.533 --> 36:25.967
I thought you were done.

36:26.034 --> 36:27.467
Well, we just have a couple more questions.

36:27.533 --> 36:28.967
Actually, just one more question.

36:29.034 --> 36:30.700
Are you ready to leave?

36:30.767 --> 36:34.301
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

36:34.368 --> 36:36.201
You need to leave here
before Jamie sees us.

36:37.767 --> 36:40.368
No, actually...

36:40.433 --> 36:42.700
I want you to leave.

36:42.767 --> 36:43.800
What is that?

36:43.867 --> 36:45.134
It's a safehouse.

36:45.201 --> 36:46.600
It's a licensed non-profit for battered women.

36:46.667 --> 36:48.834
They'll take you and your children
and get you out of here

36:48.901 --> 36:49.867
and find you a place to stay,

36:49.934 --> 36:51.368
and they will never reveal your location...

36:51.433 --> 36:52.533
Are you out of your mind?

36:52.600 --> 36:53.967
He'll find me.

36:54.034 --> 36:55.467
He'll bring me back and make me a prisoner.

36:55.533 --> 36:57.201
You already are a prisoner.

36:57.268 --> 36:59.334
You're helping her kidnap the man's children.

36:59.400 --> 37:00.634
That is not the way to do this, Foster.

37:00.700 --> 37:02.467
The van's leaving in 30 seconds.

37:02.533 --> 37:04.734
Come on. It's your last chance.

37:06.567 --> 37:08.500
I'm going with or without you,

37:08.567 --> 37:10.101
and I'm taking them with me.

37:10.167 --> 37:11.667
Come on, guys.

37:15.034 --> 37:16.734
Thank you.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.734
Go around.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.101
Come on, guys. Around the car, ok?

37:22.400 --> 37:24.667
Hey! Hey!

37:24.734 --> 37:27.567
Catherine, what are you doing?

37:27.634 --> 37:29.967
Those are my children, Catherine!

37:30.034 --> 37:33.500
Don't... Catherine! Catherine, stay here!

37:33.567 --> 37:36.201
Catherine! Hey! Hey!

37:36.268 --> 37:37.834
Hey!

37:50.301 --> 37:51.667
That was a big mistake.

37:53.968 --> 37:56.968
You aided and abeted the escape
of the only possible person

37:57.567 --> 37:58.834
we could have prosecuted.

37:58.901 --> 38:00.400
I have no idea where the van came from,

38:00.467 --> 38:02.967
and I had nothing to do
with Catherine's departure.

38:03.034 --> 38:05.201
Mr. Cowley tells a different story.

38:05.268 --> 38:08.867
Mr. Cowley believes he's
a prophet sent from God.

38:08.934 --> 38:10.767
He's delusional.

38:10.834 --> 38:12.934
You don't play games with the IRS.

38:15.268 --> 38:16.967
Mr. Loker, um,

38:17.034 --> 38:18.867
You've been very quiet.

38:18.934 --> 38:20.967
You have anything to add?

38:26.867 --> 38:28.467
No.

38:28.533 --> 38:30.700
What Foster said is accurate.

38:37.268 --> 38:38.967
You tell Lightman he's going to have

38:39.034 --> 38:42.301
An auditor with a microscope up his british keister

38:42.368 --> 38:44.400
for as long as I have a job.

38:57.101 --> 38:59.034
Why did you do that?

38:59.101 --> 39:00.967
Well, you got to have faith in something.

39:01.034 --> 39:02.834
I'm putting mine in you.

39:02.901 --> 39:06.201
Thank you.

39:06.268 --> 39:08.800
Doesn't mean what you did was right.

39:08.867 --> 39:10.901
Boss needs you in the lab.

39:10.967 --> 39:12.867
I'll be right there.

39:17.400 --> 39:18.734
She's a kid!

39:18.800 --> 39:20.067
Oh, thanks. I appreciate that.

39:22.234 --> 39:23.567
Um, Reynolds called in a favor.

39:23.634 --> 39:25.433
He's got a cop watching Cabe.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.034
Hey, what's going on?

39:28.101 --> 39:29.800
I need fresh eyes on this.

39:29.867 --> 39:33.567
I think that the dad is going
to take a run at Cabe.

39:33.634 --> 39:35.101
Do you really think he'd go that far?

39:35.167 --> 39:36.934
He doesn't want to put any
blame on his daughter,

39:37.001 --> 39:38.734
So he's directing all of his anger at Cabe.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.467
Yeah. People have trouble accepting when
females are the sexual aggressors.

39:41.533 --> 39:43.067
You know, actually, it's like the Bonobo chimp...

39:43.134 --> 39:45.734
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not now, Loker.
Not now. Not now. Um.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.268
Play it again.

39:51.901 --> 39:53.901
You're the prosecutor. Do your job!

39:53.967 --> 39:55.400
All right. Just play it again. Play it again.

39:55.467 --> 39:56.901
No, no, no. Let it play. Let it play.

39:56.967 --> 39:58.368
Make someone pay.

39:58.433 --> 40:00.901
Listen to his words.

40:00.967 --> 40:02.567
The system is at fault.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.901
"The system has to make someone pay."

40:04.967 --> 40:06.867
Oh, hell.
What?

40:06.934 --> 40:09.834
Call the police. He's not going after Cabe.

40:15.700 --> 40:19.101
* Are those halos in your hair *

40:19.167 --> 40:21.667
Someone has to pay.

40:21.734 --> 40:24.368
* Or diamonds shining there? *

40:26.967 --> 40:28.567
*Without a hope *

40:28.634 --> 40:32.667
* without a prayer *

40:35.700 --> 40:39.368
* this rain beats down like death *

40:41.368 --> 40:43.500
* you turn your eyes to *

40:43.567 --> 40:47.368
*better men *

40:50.334 --> 40:52.533
* before I go *

40:52.600 --> 40:58.067
* I'm hanging a cross on the nail *

40:58.134 --> 41:01.967
* I hung one for you in there... *

41:02.034 --> 41:03.834
Did you see his face?
Yeah.

41:03.901 --> 41:06.567
He's at peace.

41:09.867 --> 41:13.700
* Girl, lay your shame to rest *

41:13.767 --> 41:21.567
* then hold the lies close to your breast *

41:24.533 --> 41:28.001
* you stoop to feed the crows *

41:28.067 --> 41:30.700
* some scraps of truth *

41:30.767 --> 41:31.867
Come in.

41:31.934 --> 41:36.368
*Already cold... *

41:36.433 --> 41:39.301
How you doing, love?

41:39.368 --> 41:41.700
I'm just thinking about Susan.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.201
She doesn't have a mom,

41:43.268 --> 41:45.500
and now, her dad's in prison.

41:45.567 --> 41:47.967
What's going to happen to her?

41:50.368 --> 41:52.767
I don't know, love. I don't know.

41:52.834 --> 41:54.433
I mean, she was just excited

41:54.500 --> 41:56.268
that the older girls liked her.

41:56.334 --> 41:58.767
I was excited that they liked me.

41:58.834 --> 42:02.767
Now, a man's dead, and...

42:02.834 --> 42:05.167
Susan doesn't have any family.

42:05.234 --> 42:08.467
How did all of this get so messed up?

42:08.533 --> 42:12.901
See, this is what I mean
about consequences, love.

42:12.967 --> 42:14.901
Can't predict them.

42:14.967 --> 42:18.167
And when it comes
to you,

42:18.234 --> 42:20.134
that's what scares me the most...

42:21.334 --> 42:23.334
The unknown.

42:24.834 --> 42:28.834
* Are those halos in your hair? *

42:31.167 --> 42:36.500
* Without a hope, without a prayer *

42:38.800 --> 42:40.034
I'm sorry.

42:40.101 --> 42:42.500
It's all good.

42:45.201 --> 42:50.067
* You finally lay your shame to rest... *

42:53.700 --> 42:56.433
I love you.

42:58.433 --> 43:00.667
I love you, too.

43:03.067 --> 43:05.067
Be good, all right?
