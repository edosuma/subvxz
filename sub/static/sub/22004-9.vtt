00:06.507 --> 00:08.276
*

00:12.213 --> 00:13.314
(spectators cheer)

00:13.347 --> 00:14.748
Yeah. Thank you.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.185
How adorable!
Can we take a photo?

00:17.218 --> 00:18.752
Be my guest, ma'am. Come on.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.188
Get together.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.589
YOUNG MAN:
There.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.724
Can you take another one?

00:23.757 --> 00:24.792
Good girl.

00:24.825 --> 00:25.793
(barks)

00:28.196 --> 00:30.331
(cheering)

00:31.599 --> 00:33.667
*

00:42.110 --> 00:44.445
Not bad for a Monday.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.480
Check out the fish.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.191
Give you a hand?
You look a little lost.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.160
Actually, uh,
I'm looking for the Hyatt.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.495
Oh, sure. You're
not too far away.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.797
You want to make a
left at the corner

01:03.831 --> 01:05.333
and just keep
going down...

01:05.366 --> 01:07.568
What the hell?

01:09.237 --> 01:10.404
(cheering)

01:12.906 --> 01:14.242
Tita!

01:14.275 --> 01:15.643
(shouts)

01:15.676 --> 01:16.644
KC!

01:16.677 --> 01:19.147
Yo! Let go of that kid!

01:19.180 --> 01:20.348
Give me my bags first!

01:20.381 --> 01:22.250
This isn't a negotiation.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.517
BOY: Come on, man.
BOY 2: You heard him, man.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.386
GIRL:
Give him.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.190
Yeah, that's right.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.758
This isn't over, kid.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.726
I seen your face,
and I will find you.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.228
I hope you do.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.196
Captain.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.636
(sighs)

01:43.604 --> 01:46.106
(birds chirping)

01:52.680 --> 01:54.148
Hey, buddy.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.816
It's time to wake up.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.218
Hey.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.520
Sleeping Beauty. Hey...

02:00.388 --> 02:01.755
(gasps)
Oh...

02:06.194 --> 02:08.562
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:08.596 --> 02:11.165
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:11.199 --> 02:13.667
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:13.701 --> 02:15.169
* How, how, how, how

02:15.203 --> 02:17.338
* Hey, hey

02:22.976 --> 02:24.545
* You gotta come on.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.217
Sorry I'm late.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.718
Oh, no worries.
Knew you would be.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.387
Tuesday 8:00 a.m.'s
a regular thing with the...

02:33.421 --> 02:34.822
Therapist.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.191
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.
I know.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.327
Hey! How's
the headshrinker?

02:39.360 --> 02:40.661
You, too?

02:40.694 --> 02:42.263
I mean, I think
it's great.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.764
You're a lot less
stressed lately.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.199
We've all been
talking about it.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.600
You have?
Yeah!

02:46.634 --> 02:48.602
You know, your
mental health

02:48.636 --> 02:51.472
is in direct correlation
with our job health.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.207
Well, I'm touched.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.975
What she means is,
with everything on your plate,

02:55.008 --> 02:56.944
you know, Hamilton
and Wade's son being kidnapped,

02:56.977 --> 02:58.679
you know, we were worried
about you.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.748
You don't have to be.
Not anymore,

03:00.781 --> 03:03.684
since you've
been seeing...

03:03.717 --> 03:05.353
The therapist.
Right.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.588
And, you know, the great
thing about this...
Mm.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.791
...is if you have some feelings
that you want to talk about,

03:10.824 --> 03:12.293
you got someone.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.827
Actually,

03:13.861 --> 03:16.230
there is something
that I would like to talk about.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.866
Okay. We're-we're all ears.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.868
Why don't you tell me
about our murder victim?

03:20.901 --> 03:23.537
Right. Petty Officer

03:23.571 --> 03:25.739
Michael Thompson, mass
communications specialist,

03:25.773 --> 03:27.007
just in from Dubai.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.642
What's he doing
in New Orleans?

03:28.676 --> 03:30.678
Navy assigned him to photograph
the tricentennial kickoff

03:30.711 --> 03:32.246
for the Navy Times.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.249
Landed yesterday at Belle Chasse
on a military transport.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.418
Cab dropped him in the Quarter
in the afternoon.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.253
Never made it
to the hotel.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.254
Morning, Loretta.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.255
Dwayne.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.923
Any sign of luggage?

03:42.956 --> 03:44.392
No watch or wallet, either.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.659
So he got caught

03:45.693 --> 03:47.861
on the wrong end of a stickup?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.497
Well, armed robbers tend

03:49.530 --> 03:50.498
to shoot their victims
face-to-face,

03:50.531 --> 03:51.832
out of fear.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.901
Petty Officer Thompson was shot

03:53.934 --> 03:54.968
twice to the back
of the head.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.804
Execution-style.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.640
He has contusions on his hands,
bruising on his body.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.309
He was beaten, too.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.043
So this was more
than a robbery.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.045
Lasalle's canvassing the area
for witnesses.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.381
Sebastian's
pulling surveillance.

04:07.415 --> 04:10.050
I want to know
what they found.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.920
Pulled this from an
NOPD security camera.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.423
Got our victim, suspect,
and murder weapon

04:15.456 --> 04:16.990
all wrapped up
in a bow. Yeah.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.426
There's no mistaking
what this is.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.794
Gutter punks.
Gutter what now?

04:20.828 --> 04:21.762
Gutter punks.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.030
Come on, Gregorio.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.164
How long have you lived
in New Orleans?

04:24.197 --> 04:26.834
Clearly not long enough to know
what a gutter punk is.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.068
Gutter punks are kids
who slip through the cracks

04:28.101 --> 04:30.471
of Child Services,
end up on the street

04:30.504 --> 04:32.873
to avoid group homes
or shelters.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.442
Oh, yeah, you're talking
about the street kids.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.009
We call them "crusties"
in New York.

04:36.043 --> 04:39.413
Well, here they generally cause
mayhem wherever they go.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.982
Kind of like the minor leagues
of crime.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.752
A little more complicated
than that, but...
LASALLE: I'm with Percy, King.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.587
They're a menace.
I mean, picking pockets,

04:46.620 --> 04:48.922
running scams,
pulling snatch and grabs.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.392
All petty crime.
Nothing like murder.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.594
Well, I mean, aren't we looking
at the evidence right now?

04:53.627 --> 04:54.795
Scary looking kid

04:54.828 --> 04:55.963
pointing a gun
at our dead sailor.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.498
PRIDE: Yeah, but not
pulling the trigger.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.966
And this was yesterday.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.469
Thompson's body was found
early this morning.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.671
What happened in between?
Well, Thompson
continued the chase,

05:03.704 --> 05:04.972
caught up with the suspect,

05:05.005 --> 05:07.007
and took a beating and a bullet
for his trouble.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.476
Body got dumped.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.411
Bull's-eye.
Let's put out a BOLO.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.879
But what about the weapon?

05:11.912 --> 05:13.080
The gun in the video

05:13.113 --> 05:14.114
is small caliber.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.949
.22, maybe .25.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.652
But we recovered
9mm casings

05:18.686 --> 05:20.454
at the crime scene.
Yeah, so...

05:20.488 --> 05:21.555
suspect had another gun.

05:21.589 --> 05:24.124
Maybe.
Okay. We're not 100%

05:24.157 --> 05:26.927
that they killed Thompson,
but it's looking good.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.896
LASALLE: Plus, we do know
they robbed him.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.131
Let's follow protocol.
I'll call NOPD,

05:31.164 --> 05:34.134
and we can sort it all out once
we have the kids in custody.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.036
PRIDE:
Not just yet.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.406
I mean, you did hear the part
where Lasalle said

05:38.439 --> 05:40.908
it's protocol, right?
We got the kid on tape

05:40.941 --> 05:42.543
committing a felony.
I know.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.545
But I also know we got thousands
of tourists in town

05:44.578 --> 05:46.414
for the tricentennial kickoff.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.116
City officials are
cracking down.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.718
They get word that it's possible

05:50.751 --> 05:53.554
that some gutter punk
shot Thompson,

05:53.587 --> 05:55.989
it'll be war on all of 'em.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.658
What are you saying here, King?

05:57.691 --> 06:00.794
(sighs) Guys,
we're not off the rails here.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.464
We're just crossing Ts
and dotting Is, okay?

06:03.497 --> 06:05.399
If you say so.
I do.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.101
You and Lasalle hit the streets,
try and find these kids.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.102
Sebastian,

06:09.136 --> 06:10.871
head to the pawn shops.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.907
See if somebody tried
to sell Thompson's property.

06:13.941 --> 06:14.975
What are we gonna do?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.644
We're gonna go to DCFS.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.112
I got a friend who works there.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.781
Maybe he can help.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.550
MAN:
You know, Dwayne,

06:22.583 --> 06:25.052
used to be a time when
you'd just visit to say hello

06:25.085 --> 06:26.587
without needing something.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.188
I remember an invitation
to play at the bar,

06:28.221 --> 06:30.491
and I haven't seen you there
yet.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.092
This guy plays
a mean trombone.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.495
Oh, yeah? You known
each other a long time?

06:34.528 --> 06:36.830
20 years.
Dwayne used to work juvie crime

06:36.864 --> 06:37.898
when he was a deputy.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.066
Helped a lot of these kids.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.868
Not as many as I wanted.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.870
Someday, you'll have
to let that go, Dwayne.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.772
What happened to Angel
wasn't your fault.

06:44.805 --> 06:45.639
Who's Angel?

06:45.673 --> 06:46.940
Ancient history.

06:46.974 --> 06:50.110
Look, all the time
I've put in here,

06:50.143 --> 06:51.645
I know what I'm talking about.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.213
Some kids
can't be helped.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.550
Like the one you're asking
about now. KC Vaughn.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.185
Crossed my desk
more times than I can count.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.053
What can you tell us about him?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.955
Lost his family in Katrina.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.558
In and out of foster care,
on and off the streets,

07:04.592 --> 07:05.726
gangs, juvie.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.994
Any idea where we can find him?

07:07.027 --> 07:08.829
He's aged out of the system.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.664
Somebody else's problem now.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.165
That's a little callous, Dan.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.167
See this pile?

07:14.201 --> 07:16.970
I save my compassion
for the kids who want help.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.473
Whether they want it or not,
they all need it.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.241
I don't have the luxury
or the resources

07:21.274 --> 07:23.677
to think like that anymore.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.245
Lost a quarter of my staff

07:25.278 --> 07:27.781
when that whole Hamilton debacle
went down.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.150
There was funding for us
in that shipyard deal.

07:30.183 --> 07:33.621
That was the last, best
chance for those kids.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.023
Yeah. If you don't know
where he is,

07:36.056 --> 07:37.825
you got a line
on someone who does?

07:37.858 --> 07:39.126
Yeah.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.128
My liaison at NOPD.

07:41.161 --> 07:44.064
Just as soon
not bring the cops in.

07:46.033 --> 07:49.136
You said this kid and his crew
committed robbery.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.004
I'm obligated to report that.

07:51.038 --> 07:54.642
Sure. Just...
maybe not for a day or so.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.545
As a favor from one sideman
to another?

07:57.578 --> 08:00.047
You got the day.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.550
(phone chimes)

08:02.583 --> 08:05.252
Thanks, bud.
Good seeing you.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.555
Sonja.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.123
Said they almost caught
one of the gutter punks.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.992
What?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.961
PRIDE: Sonja, what do you mean,
"almost"?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.630
Well, I had to break the chase
'cause Evel Knievel here

08:16.664 --> 08:18.632
almost slipped
off a fire escape.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.067
Hey, those kids are slippery.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.869
And fast.
And you are not a ninja.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.537
Which is why you don't
jump on and off buildings

08:23.571 --> 08:25.639
like one.
You all right, Chris?

08:25.673 --> 08:27.741
Yeah. Just bruised my ego.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.743
And his head.
(hisses)

08:29.777 --> 08:31.812
But I say it's time to bring in
the professionals.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.081
Let NOPD swing
from the rooftops.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.717
I don't think anyone's
gonna have to swing around.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.720
We want to catch one
of these gutter punks,

08:39.753 --> 08:41.789
we need to think like 'em.

08:44.725 --> 08:48.562
Why you eyeballing me
like that?

08:48.596 --> 08:50.598
*

08:52.099 --> 08:54.968
SEBASTIAN: Testing. One,
two, three. Can you hear me?

08:55.002 --> 08:57.605
Yes, and I want it
on the official record

08:57.638 --> 08:59.072
that I feel ridiculous.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.874
Duly noted, but...

09:00.908 --> 09:03.677
you look mah-velous.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.680
Still don't even know how I got
picked for this plum assignment.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.982
Well, Lasalle and I were up
and down these streets all day.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.183
Kids know we're feds.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.786
Yeah, and I can't pull off
a high-heeled boot, apparently.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.122
Oh, gutter punk. My 12 o'clock.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.157
Hi!

09:17.190 --> 09:18.325
He's so cute. May I?

09:18.358 --> 09:21.128
Yeah, lady.
Knock yourself out.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.131
Oh, so cute. So sweet.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.032
(chuckles):
Hi.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.967
Wait, she took my bag.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.737
Wait! What are you doing?!

09:31.739 --> 09:33.641
They took the bait.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.076
Way to go, Meryl Streep!

09:36.109 --> 09:37.044
Bite me.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.145
Please tell me

09:38.178 --> 09:39.279
you got a trace on them.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.513
We got it. All we got to do now
is follow the signal.

09:40.547 --> 09:43.651
All I got to do is get these
boots off. They're killing me.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.718
(engine revving)

09:46.987 --> 09:49.022
(rock music playing)

10:03.036 --> 10:05.172
It's like a Ninja Turtles movie
in here.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.373
Federal agents!

10:06.406 --> 10:07.975
Everyone stay
where you are!
Raid!

10:08.008 --> 10:09.843
(shouting indistinctly)

10:09.877 --> 10:11.211
Come on, Lil Man!
Let's go!

10:13.013 --> 10:14.915
Headed your way, Pride.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.853
PRIDE: Hold on.
We just want to talk.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.723
Not this way!

10:22.756 --> 10:23.791
Pickup! Go, go!

10:23.824 --> 10:25.859
Over here!

10:25.893 --> 10:27.427
Nope! No, you don't!
Wait!

10:27.460 --> 10:29.196
You got to be kidding me!

10:29.229 --> 10:30.831
Hey!
You better stop!

10:30.864 --> 10:33.066
Come on, hurry up!
Come on.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.134
GREGORIO: Come here!
Come on, get up.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.203
Give me your hand,
give me your hand!

10:36.236 --> 10:38.138
(grunts)
Damn...

10:38.939 --> 10:41.174
Gotcha.
Get off me!

10:41.208 --> 10:42.175
Get off!
Be still.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.877
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.045
What, is this all you got?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.381
They're all we need.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.950
(siren wailing)

10:49.983 --> 10:52.119
Neighbors must've
called the cops.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.788
Let's get these two out of here
before they arrive.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.790
We're gonna run?
We're gonna walk quickly.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.693
Come on.
Never thought I'd see the day

10:59.727 --> 11:01.394
when we flee from NOPD.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.775
Here we go.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.010
What's this?
Shrimp creole.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.780
It's one of our
boss's specialties.
Yeah, he figured you guys

11:19.813 --> 11:22.049
probably hadn't
a home-cooked meal in a while,

11:22.082 --> 11:23.784
so... (clicks tongue)
Mm-hmm.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.085
Dig in.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.720
I'm not hungry.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.057
Yeah, not hungry.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.959
Oh, that's a shame,
because this will probably be

11:31.992 --> 11:33.827
your last decent meal
for a while

11:33.861 --> 11:35.162
since you're in
so much trouble.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.130
What's your name? Tita Palmer.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.066
There's, like, thousands of
dollars' worth

11:39.099 --> 11:40.768
of stolen goods here.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.836
That's grand theft. A felony.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.204
So the only
thing standing

11:44.237 --> 11:48.041
between you and jail right now
are the two of us.

11:48.075 --> 11:51.745
I'm 15. He's ten.
We're minors.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.413
You can't even talk to us
without an advocate present.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.048
You're right.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.084
Probably for Lil Man.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.119
But we found the switchblade
in your pocket.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.154
That's weapons possession,
baby girl.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.791
Add that to the murder
of a navy sailor,

12:03.824 --> 12:05.325
and you're being tried
as an adult.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.094
Do your worst.
Hey, listen,

12:07.127 --> 12:08.495
we don't think
you killed anyone,

12:08.528 --> 12:10.263
but we do need to talk
to your friend KC.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.464
We know he had

12:11.498 --> 12:13.166
our victim's camera bag
and a gun.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.135
Who?

12:15.168 --> 12:17.204
(scoffs)

12:17.237 --> 12:18.839
This guy.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.240
The one you're standing next to.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.909
The one with the gun

12:21.942 --> 12:23.143
pointed at our murder victim.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.945
KC ain't no killer.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.446
Then tell us where he is so
we can straighten this all out.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.482
Give us some shrimp
and a big smile,

12:29.516 --> 12:31.084
suddenly we're best friends?

12:31.118 --> 12:33.086
Hey, we're not trying
to jam you up, girl.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.788
There's no NOPD here.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.124
No DCFS. It's just us.

12:37.157 --> 12:40.093
DCFS, NOPD, NCIS--

12:40.127 --> 12:43.263
it's all different letters
that spell the same thing.

12:43.296 --> 12:47.000
C-O-P-S.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.270
PRIDE:
No reason to trust cops.

12:50.303 --> 12:54.107
Of course, she could actually
be involved in the murder.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.009
It's possible.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.311
I think it's a little more
than possible, King.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.847
I mean, she runs with KC,

12:59.880 --> 13:01.815
and his record
speaks for itself.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.051
Assault, weapons possession...

13:04.084 --> 13:05.518
I mean, it's not a stretch

13:05.552 --> 13:07.487
to think that he pulled
the trigger.
Maybe.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.289
But execution-style murder?

13:09.322 --> 13:11.024
Just doesn't sit right with me.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.060
Doesn't really matter
how it sits.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.028
I mean, we need

13:15.062 --> 13:16.163
to loop in NOPD, King.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.865
Well, it's official.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.199
I've been to every pawn shop
in New Orleans.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.367
No sign of Thompson's camera.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.102
Although I did notice

13:22.135 --> 13:23.336
a really disturbing trend
of people giving up

13:23.370 --> 13:25.038
their Franklin Mint
collectible plates?

13:25.072 --> 13:25.973
I'm not surprised.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.175
I am. I thought
those things were forever.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.877
I mean, Thompson's camera.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.079
Our pawn shops know
to stay clear

13:32.112 --> 13:34.047
of gutter punks. KC probably

13:34.081 --> 13:35.015
had to go to a fence.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.384
Guessing I can't just
google "fence," huh?

13:37.417 --> 13:39.152
Not feeling optimistic
about getting a statement

13:39.186 --> 13:40.553
from these kids.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.455
Maybe you could call
your buddy at DCFS,

13:42.489 --> 13:44.057
get them a place to sleep
for the night.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.025
We'll try again in the morning.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.027
No, I don't want
to turn them over. Not yet.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.897
So you don't want us
to call the cops,

13:49.930 --> 13:52.532
and you don't want us
to call social services.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.935
I know firsthand
what happens to kids like these

13:54.968 --> 13:57.004
when they get accused
of high-profile crime.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.238
They don't just get
lost in the system;

13:58.271 --> 13:59.907
they get swept away by it.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.274
Doesn't matter
if they're innocent.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.976
Damage is already done.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.112
Oh, is this about that kid
from your sheriff days, or...?

14:05.145 --> 14:08.916
It's about these kids.
Okay. But, eventually,

14:08.949 --> 14:11.151
we're gonna
follow protocol, right?

14:11.184 --> 14:12.652
Turn the kids over.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.955
I mean, because it's the law.

14:14.988 --> 14:17.057
You're worried
I'm crossing the line.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.193
Going off book.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.895
But I promise,

14:21.929 --> 14:23.196
no grand gestures.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.532
Just want to keep
Tita and Lil Man

14:25.565 --> 14:27.434
out of the system for 24 hours

14:27.467 --> 14:30.971
until we know
what really happened, okay?

14:31.004 --> 14:32.139
Yeah.
LASALLE:
Okay.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.473
All right.
Yeah.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.575
Now...

14:35.608 --> 14:38.078
how do we get
Tita and Lil Man to talk?

14:38.111 --> 14:40.247
Tita is very loyal to KC.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.949
We're gonna have to
gain her trust,

14:41.982 --> 14:43.283
and it's not gonna happen
anywhere near

14:43.316 --> 14:45.418
interrogation rooms
or handcuffs.
Okay.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.587
I'm open to suggestions.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.622
Okay.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.063
Worst idea ever.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.065
Worse than bringing a
Russian prisoner home?

14:58.098 --> 14:59.632
Oh, it's up there.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.169
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Sir.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.971
Don't touch that. Drop it.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.539
Thank you. Back up. Mm-hmm.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.541
We gonna have to have
a conversation

15:08.575 --> 15:10.710
about boundaries.
Okay.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.445
Oh, my God.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.680
Sorry.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.715
(sighs)
Two women living together,

15:15.748 --> 15:18.986
and there's nothing but
hot sauce and assorted mustards.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.187
Yeah, we like our condiments.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.055
But I ordered a pizza.
Should be coming.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.191
You should, uh,
go get washed up.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.093
I'm fine.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.195
Lil Man could use a bath.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.163
Yeah, or three. But I'm on it.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.198
(grunts) Get off me.
Come on, boy.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.333
And he's using your bathroom.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.335
LIL MAN:
I don't need a bath.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.238
You missed the best feature
in our kitchen.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.609
Mm-hmm. Have at it.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.712
Trying to bribe me
with ice cream?

15:45.745 --> 15:48.115
That might work with Lil Man.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.085
Suit yourself.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.620
You think playing house
for a few hours

15:53.653 --> 15:55.355
is gonna get us to rat on KC?

15:55.388 --> 15:58.125
Oh, no, not with you.
You're hard, right?

15:58.158 --> 16:00.193
Grew up with kids like
you from New York.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.728
You're like stone
on the outside.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.230
Street certified.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.732
But deep down
you just want to be cared for.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.068
Might have been how it was
in the olden days.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.170
That's why
you're so loyal to KC.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.705
You stuck around for Lil Man
when we raided that flop house.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.107
You look out for each other

16:14.141 --> 16:15.108
because you know
no one else will.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.045
You done with
the compassion monologue yet?

16:18.078 --> 16:20.013
Almost.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.015
You know, you're here
for a reason tonight.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.051
'Cause you got my back, right?
That's what you're gonna say.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.053
How many times
have I heard that?

16:26.086 --> 16:28.388
Cops, social workers,
psychologists...

16:28.421 --> 16:30.157
Everybody's got my back

16:30.190 --> 16:31.458
until they don't.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.294
Then it's back
to a group home or juvie.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.063
Where I come from
your word is your bond,

16:36.096 --> 16:37.464
so if I say
I'm gonna protect you,

16:37.497 --> 16:38.731
then I'm gonna protect you.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.233
You just need to open up.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.634
(doorbell rings)

16:41.668 --> 16:44.604
That's the pizza.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.217
*

17:00.187 --> 17:02.055
What do you know, Christopher?

17:02.089 --> 17:04.157
Sebastian and I
paid a visit to Big Pete.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.459
Clearwater fence I know
from back in the day.

17:06.493 --> 17:07.760
He had Thompson's camera?

17:07.794 --> 17:09.496
No, but he saw it, though.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.531
Gutter punk kid tried
to sell it to him this morning.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.100
Pete heard about the shooting.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.834
Turned him down.
KC?

17:14.867 --> 17:15.835
Different kid.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.437
Came in with a dog.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.140
One who helped rob Gregorio.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.474
Few hours later,

17:21.508 --> 17:23.343
someone else came looking
for the camera.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.677
Guy in a suit.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.779
European accent.
He offered him big bucks.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.715
Get more of a description?

17:28.748 --> 17:30.650
No, but Pete's got
a security camera.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.685
Sebastian's pulling
the footage now.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.354
Okay.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.655
So, why are we here?

17:35.688 --> 17:38.191
Pete's warehouse
is down the block.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.193
Says he's seen
the gutter punk kids

17:40.227 --> 17:41.861
hanging around the
neighborhood recently.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.863
Abandoned church.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.199
Clearwater Baptist.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.169
Same place you took Hamilton
a few months ago when...

17:49.202 --> 17:51.171
Yeah, I know.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.839
Nothing's changed at all, huh?

17:52.872 --> 17:55.608
Stopped the shipyard deal and...

17:55.642 --> 17:57.610
everything just
ground to a halt.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.679
Hey, that's not on you, King.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.115
All right?
If you didn't stop Hamilton,

18:02.149 --> 18:04.851
he would have hurt
a lot of people around here.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.354
Yeah.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.122
Let's go find this kid.

18:09.156 --> 18:12.325
Got to find that camera
if we're gonna catch the killer.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.908
Christopher.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.178
KC?

18:31.211 --> 18:32.879
No.

18:32.912 --> 18:36.349
No, the kid with the dog.

18:36.383 --> 18:39.452
(dog growling)
Shh...

18:39.486 --> 18:41.921
Shh, it's okay. It's okay.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.591
KC wouldn't kill one of his own.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.926
Guessing it's the guy
in the suit.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.163
Got to be after that camera.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.798
Which means KC's
got a target on his back.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.247
*

19:12.352 --> 19:14.787
(water running, clattering)

19:21.861 --> 19:23.830
Hey.

19:23.863 --> 19:24.831
What are you guys doing?

19:24.864 --> 19:26.733
Mexican scrambled eggs.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.435
Oh, yeah?

19:28.468 --> 19:30.370
What makes it so Mexican?

19:30.403 --> 19:32.439
Salsa, sour cream
and canned beans.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.506
My recipe.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.741
TITA:
But trust me,

19:34.774 --> 19:36.443
they taste better
than they look.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.677
I don't doubt it.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.446
Could have slept in
your bed, you know.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.947
You didn't have to
block the door.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.515
It's to keep you safe.

19:42.549 --> 19:45.418
You wanted to make sure
we didn't bolt.
Sure.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.354
And to keep you safe.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.956
Gregorio, we need to talk.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.460
Pride called.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.362
One of our gutter punks
got killed last night.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.230
He thinks KC may be next.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.331
Maybe even Tita and Lil Man.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.832
He wants us back at NCIS.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.401
All right, let's go.
Okay.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.503
Guys, we got to take
this breakfast to go, all right?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.938
I know what this means.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.775
You're about
to march us to DCFS.
What'd I say?

20:08.808 --> 20:10.343
I said I wasn't
gonna turn you in, right?

20:10.377 --> 20:11.944
Now pack up

20:11.978 --> 20:13.780
the breakfast to go
and come with us to NCIS

20:13.813 --> 20:15.415
and help us find KC.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.817
Now.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.889
WADE:
It's Joey Simpson,

20:22.922 --> 20:25.425
shot twice execution-style
to the back of the head.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.394
Just like Petty
Officer Thompson.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.396
Yeah. And ballistics
came back with a match

20:29.429 --> 20:31.364
with nine millimeter
Parrabellum rounds.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.699
Sebastian sent this image

20:32.732 --> 20:34.967
from our fence's
security camera.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.470
That the man who was looking
for Thompson's camera yesterday?

20:37.504 --> 20:39.339
And it's likely
he shot two people over a camera

20:39.372 --> 20:40.907
that can't be worth
more than a couple of grand.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.476
Something must be on that camera
worth killing for.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.844
Thompson worked
for the Navy Times.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.579
Shot photos of special events.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.448
Not exactly cloak-and-dagger.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.949
Well, there's only one way
to know for sure.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.951
Have Sebastian try to
access Thompson's camera

20:51.984 --> 20:53.520
and his cloud account.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.655
Let's see what he shot.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.457
If KC still has that camera,

20:57.490 --> 20:59.759
then he's gone from being
suspect number one

20:59.792 --> 21:01.761
to our next possible victim.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.363
But not if we find him first.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.163
How are you gonna do that?

21:04.196 --> 21:06.333
I'm gonna convince
Tita and Lil Man

21:06.366 --> 21:07.667
it's the only way to save him.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.504
Should we be expecting
next of kin?

21:11.538 --> 21:15.074
Joey was an orphan,
according to his records.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.611
Kids like him and KC
don't have anyone.

21:18.645 --> 21:21.648
That's not true,
they have each other.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.718
(Dakota whimpers)

21:25.752 --> 21:27.954
I was able to access Thompson's
photo library in the cloud.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.423
Thousands of pictures,
mostly portraits, cityscapes,

21:30.457 --> 21:31.891
nothing valuable.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.626
Is it possible that there's
photos on the camera

21:33.660 --> 21:35.928
that haven't uploaded?
Oh, totally, yeah.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.697
This model of camera uploads
as soon as it's turned on.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.031
So when that happens...

21:39.065 --> 21:40.433
You can track its GPS.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.568
That's good work,
Sebastian.

21:41.601 --> 21:42.769
Oh, not just me.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.604
It's my trusty
sidekick here, too.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.473
She's not as fast as Patton
on the keyboard,

21:46.506 --> 21:48.375
but she's nowhere near
as loud either, so...

21:48.408 --> 21:51.378
(barks)
Except for... just then.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.814
LIL MAN and TITA:
Dakota!

21:54.847 --> 21:56.516
(whining)

21:56.549 --> 21:58.685
(laughing)
Hi.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.388
Is Joey here?

22:01.421 --> 22:03.490
I'm afraid not.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.858
Good girl. Good girl.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.627
Something bad happened.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.828
We should go in
the other room.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.530
I don't want to go
in the other room.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.098
I want to know what happened.
And we're gonna tell you,

22:12.131 --> 22:13.666
just not in front of Lil Man.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.802
Pride. I had to hear

22:15.835 --> 22:18.538
from NOPD that Joey Simpson
was killed last night,

22:18.571 --> 22:20.373
and you found the body.
Joey's dead?

22:20.407 --> 22:21.708
YOUNG:
I'm assuming that KC's

22:21.741 --> 22:22.409
responsible for
this murder, too?

22:22.442 --> 22:24.711
Don't know the answers yet, Dan.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.813
There's no evidence that says
KC did it.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.047
Because he didn't.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.883
I know you. Tita, right?

22:30.917 --> 22:32.985
And this kid, too,

22:33.019 --> 22:35.722
part of KC's crew.
What are they doing here?

22:35.755 --> 22:37.123
They're helping us
with our investigation.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.791
You're hiding KC, too?

22:38.825 --> 22:40.393
We haven't found him yet,

22:40.427 --> 22:42.395
but he's in serious danger
and so are they.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.963
You said "wait
a day," Dwayne.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.532
And I did, 'cause
we're friends.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.866
What you did not say
is that you'd be

22:46.899 --> 22:49.402
willfully violating
procedure in that day.

22:49.436 --> 22:50.703
I'm trying to save kids.

22:50.737 --> 22:51.704
You did a hell of
a job with Joey.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.172
That's not fair.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.174
I could have contacted NOPD.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.776
I could have swept
up this whole crew

22:56.809 --> 22:58.077
and put them
someplace safe.

22:58.110 --> 22:59.846
He means a group home.
No, Tita.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.781
I promise you we're not
putting you back in a home.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.050
You're not authorized to
make that kind of promise.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.752
These are minor
dependents of the court.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.119
Take them into custody.
Now, now, now,
just wait a minute.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.721
Run!
Hey!

23:08.755 --> 23:10.089
Tita, stop!
(Dakota barking)

23:11.691 --> 23:13.426
GREGORIO:
Tita, stop! Tita!

23:13.460 --> 23:15.928
Come on.
Dan. Dan, I'm sorry.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.196
I should have told you sooner,

23:17.229 --> 23:18.898
but there's a killer out there,

23:18.931 --> 23:20.199
and these kids need protection.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.968
And I'll take care of them.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.770
Every gutter punk
that the NOPD finds

23:23.803 --> 23:25.672
will be put in a
secure facility.
Youth Detention.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.607
It's like treating them
like they're criminals.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.709
I'm working with the resources
I have available to me.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.711
And I'm following the rules.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.112
You might try that sometime.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.584
You haven't changed
in 20 years, Dwayne.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.118
It didn't help
the kid back then,

23:39.151 --> 23:41.554
and you're not
helping them now.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.989
Let's go.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.758
Nah.

23:45.792 --> 23:46.959
Dog stays.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.628
(growls)

23:48.661 --> 23:51.163
Suit yourself.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.799
Tita's gone.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.734
We'll find her.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.102
We'll get Lil Man back, too.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.303
Thompson's camera just got
switched on.

23:57.336 --> 24:00.039
I was able to track the GPS
signal and I'm not the only one.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.674
Somebody else is
tracking it, too.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.010
Okay, call Lasalle, tell him
to meet me and Sonja there.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.579
Gregorio,
keep looking for Tita.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.190
KC:
Yo, Tita.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.692
How'd you find me?

24:52.725 --> 24:53.893
You told me about this place

24:53.926 --> 24:55.828
the first day we met
on the street.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.697
Your mom used to work here,
right?

24:57.730 --> 24:59.231
Yeah. It's a dump now.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.100
It used to be real pretty
back in the day, though.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.234
(both laugh)

25:03.770 --> 25:04.871
Smile.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.706
Camera's jammed.
We got to go.

25:06.739 --> 25:09.108
The cops are after us,

25:09.141 --> 25:11.110
DCFS got Lil Man,

25:11.143 --> 25:13.713
and I think someone
killed Joey.

25:13.746 --> 25:17.650
Yeah, I know.
I... I saw him.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.752
I think it's got something to do
with this camera.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.287
Forget about the camera.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.822
No, if there's something
special about it,

25:22.855 --> 25:24.591
maybe it's worth something big.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.192
TITA:
What are you
talking about?

25:26.225 --> 25:27.226
Holy crap.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.999
(thud nearby)

25:33.032 --> 25:35.668
Shh.

25:44.811 --> 25:45.745
(clatters)

25:51.784 --> 25:53.786
Sebastian says
the camera's inside.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.622
Any idea who else
is tracking it?

25:55.655 --> 25:58.057
(gunshots)
Whoever it is got here first.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.676
NCIS! Drop your weapon!

26:20.680 --> 26:22.749
(tires screeching)

26:25.151 --> 26:27.654
King? You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.789
Is he the one from
the photograph?

26:29.822 --> 26:31.924
No, but he's dressed the same.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.826
SONJA:
Well, I saw a bunch more of them
driving away in a car.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.161
I got a partial plate.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.829
Any sign of KC or Tita?

26:36.863 --> 26:38.164
SONJA: No, nothing.
Hey, King.

26:39.699 --> 26:40.833
Come check it out.

26:45.237 --> 26:48.140
All this killing and they left
the damn camera.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.184
Well, I don't think the camera's
what the killing was about.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.139
This is one of the
diamonds you found

27:20.172 --> 27:21.841
in Petty Officer
Thompson's camera.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.776
And the reason he and
Joey Simpson were murdered.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.411
You think you can trace it
back to them?

27:25.444 --> 27:27.379
Well, luckily, diamonds are
as unique as fingerprints.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.215
I was able to find
its point of origin.

27:29.248 --> 27:32.952
It's from a $30 million haul
heisted in Dubai last week.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.754
What do we know
about the thieves?
Not much.

27:34.787 --> 27:37.156
Just that they're Eastern
European, former military.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.825
We got I.D.s?
Not yet.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.793
But they're wanted
for half a dozen similar heists

27:40.827 --> 27:42.228
throughout Europe
and the Middle East.

27:42.261 --> 27:43.262
They're-they're good
at what they do.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.731
They're also ruthless.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.332
They've killed cops,
witnesses,

27:46.365 --> 27:47.867
even some of
their own members.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.468
How's Petty Officer Thompson
connected?

27:49.501 --> 27:51.270
SEBASTIAN: Well, the Dubai
heist went sideways.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.438
Private plane that they were
using to escape,

27:52.471 --> 27:54.040
it got compromised by police.

27:54.073 --> 27:54.974
The heat was
on, the cops

27:55.007 --> 27:56.375
were searching for them,
they couldn't just

27:56.408 --> 27:57.777
pack the diamonds
in their luggage

27:57.810 --> 27:58.510
and hope to
get through security.

27:58.544 --> 27:59.511
So maybe they
found someone

27:59.545 --> 28:01.714
who could smuggle the
diamonds out for them.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.850
Yeah, so Thompson flew out
on a military transport.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.484
Didn't have to go through
airport security.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.755
Think he was in on it?
Doubt it. Our sailor
was squeaky clean.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.289
Bad guys probably
snuck the diamonds

28:10.322 --> 28:11.958
in his camera without
him even knowing.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.093
Figured they'd find him
back in New Orleans,

28:14.126 --> 28:15.795
grab their haul and move on?

28:15.828 --> 28:18.164
But KC and his crew
got in the way.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.933
And Thompson got killed after
he no longer had his camera.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.501
They've already
killed twice.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.437
They tried to take out KC
and Tita at the theater.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.874
We need to track them down now.
All right, I'll call Loretta,

28:27.907 --> 28:29.909
see if she got anything
on that dead gunman.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.044
I'll call NOPD and make sure
they get these photos.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.881
Sonja, Gregorio, get the word
out to the other gutter punks.

28:34.914 --> 28:37.016
Do what it takes
to find KC and Tita.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.350
Yeah, well, this would
have been a lot easier

28:38.384 --> 28:39.518
if we took them to DCFS

28:39.551 --> 28:41.788
like we should have
in the first place.

28:43.289 --> 28:46.525
It would have, Sonja.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.795
We can absolutely
debate that

28:48.828 --> 28:51.263
after we get
them to safety.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.966
If that's all
right with you.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.402
Keep me updated.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.041
(sighs)

29:05.044 --> 29:06.846
Hey, Percy, the car's
out on the street.

29:06.879 --> 29:09.081
No, I need a minute.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.983
Okay.
(sighs)

29:11.017 --> 29:13.319
Well, you know,
there's plenty of blame

29:13.352 --> 29:14.987
to go around for
Tita being in danger.

29:15.021 --> 29:17.089
I was the one that said I
didn't want to bring her in.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.191
Yes.
Mm, no, that was Pride's choice.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.527
You were just following
his lead and me, too.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.529
Like always.
Okay, but it
always works out.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.097
We've been in worse
spots than this.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.532
It's a pattern.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.168
Pride gets tunnel vision
and we get lucky

29:29.201 --> 29:31.470
pulling out a win,
but you know what?

29:31.503 --> 29:32.704
Luck runs out.

29:32.738 --> 29:35.441
Okay, well, I, for one, won't
let our luck run out today.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.543
I promised Tita
I'd keep her safe,

29:37.576 --> 29:39.411
but I need your help.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.483
Let's go find some gutter punks.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.189
Prints came back
to one Aco Sandar,

29:50.222 --> 29:52.324
a former Serbian commando.

29:52.358 --> 29:53.860
Arrived in New Orleans
earlier this week

29:53.893 --> 29:55.327
with three companions.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.563
I relayed this to
Lasalle and Sebastian

29:57.596 --> 29:59.832
on the phone about
15 minutes ago.

29:59.866 --> 30:02.534
I know. They're running down
his cell phone, credit cards

30:02.568 --> 30:04.570
and accomplices, as we speak.

30:04.603 --> 30:06.438
And yet you're still here?

30:06.472 --> 30:09.008
My team's losing faith in me.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.944
I find that hard to believe.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.580
I'm working hard to change
how I operate, Loretta.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.182
Been seeing a therapist.
Mm-hmm.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.383
Coordinating with HQ.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.185
Made assurances that I'll...

30:19.218 --> 30:21.387
go by the book,
follow protocol.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.588
But...

30:22.621 --> 30:23.856
But when the chips are down,

30:23.890 --> 30:26.425
when I see a kid
that's vulnerable,

30:26.458 --> 30:29.428
or a friend in danger,
I can't help but go my own way.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.430
I'm hardwired
like that.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.299
Maybe the consequences
are too much.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.101
Nobody's perfect.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.502
Not even you, Dwayne Pride.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.170
You can be...

30:38.204 --> 30:40.506
stubborn, single-minded,

30:40.539 --> 30:42.541
borderline obsessive.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.911
This is the part where you're
supposed to make me feel better.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.113
I'm getting there.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.215
Because you're aware
of your bad habits,

30:49.248 --> 30:50.482
you're trying to adjust.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.584
As a matter of fact,

30:52.618 --> 30:54.086
your track record
speaks for itself.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.288
You get the job done.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.357
You save lives.

30:58.390 --> 31:02.528
And that means more to your team
than any single error.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.563
How was that for a pep talk?

31:04.596 --> 31:06.532
Pretty good.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.602
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.004
Talk to me, Sebastian.

31:12.038 --> 31:13.572
Meet Aleksander Boro,
Milos Ranko,

31:13.605 --> 31:15.241
and their leader
Simon Natali.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.409
That's the guys we saw on
the Fence's security camera.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.478
Yeah, they've been in
New Orleans for three days,

31:19.511 --> 31:21.680
and won't leave without their
$30 million in diamonds.

31:21.713 --> 31:22.949
Where are they now?

31:22.982 --> 31:24.483
NOPD found their getaway car

31:24.516 --> 31:26.285
dumped off Tchoupitoulas.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.653
Yeah, probably skulking around
gutter punk hangouts

31:27.686 --> 31:29.521
looking for KC and Tita.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.590
That's a lot of ground
to cover.
GREGORIO: Maybe not.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.960
We picked up one
of KC's crew in Clearwater.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.261
He was beat pretty bad.

31:35.294 --> 31:36.628
Said a couple guys
in sharp suits

31:36.662 --> 31:38.097
worked him over.
A few of his friends, too.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.431
Our diamond thieves.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.200
They wanted
to get a message to KC.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.469
Meet at City Park at 4:00 p.m.
behind the bandstand.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.571
Bring the merchandise
and no one else'll get hurt.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.606
Did the kid contact KC?

31:47.639 --> 31:49.575
Yeah, KC'll be there.
Probably Tita, too.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.243
And why City Park?

31:51.277 --> 31:53.612
Tricentennial Festival
starts today.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.247
Probably want to
give KC the idea

31:55.281 --> 31:57.016
that he'll be safe
in a crowd.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.518
Well, crowds never stopped these
thieves from killing people.

31:59.551 --> 32:00.586
No.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.189
So we're gonna have to.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.057
SAM:
New Orleans, what's up?

32:07.293 --> 32:09.495
Welcome to the tricentennial.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.530
We are X Ambassadors.

32:11.563 --> 32:13.966
You guys ready
to have a good time or what?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.501
(cheering, whooping)
All right.

32:15.534 --> 32:18.304
* I thought I was ready

32:18.337 --> 32:21.273
* Ready for someone else

32:21.307 --> 32:23.675
* But every time
I get ahead of myself *

32:23.709 --> 32:26.545
* Every time I get
ahead of myself *

32:26.578 --> 32:28.580
* Thought I was rock steady

32:28.614 --> 32:32.084
* That I didn't need no help

32:32.118 --> 32:34.420
* But every time
I get ahead of myself *

32:34.453 --> 32:36.255
* Every time I get
ahead of my *

32:36.288 --> 32:37.389
* I get ahead of myself

32:37.423 --> 32:39.225
All right, comms open.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.760
Let's keep this simple.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.496
If you spot the gunmen,
do not engage

32:44.530 --> 32:46.465
until we are clear
of the crowd.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.034
Can't risk a shoot-out.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.036
All right, you got it, King.
Track and follow

32:50.069 --> 32:51.603
until you give the order.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.439
Yeah.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.307
* Moved my things
to your apartment *

32:55.341 --> 32:57.576
* Down on second street

32:57.609 --> 32:59.411
What if we see
KC or Tita?

32:59.445 --> 33:00.446
Then we get them the hell

33:00.479 --> 33:02.481
out of here.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.417
Got eyes on Natali and Ranko,

33:05.451 --> 33:07.353
heading south of the stage.

33:07.386 --> 33:08.654
Copy, Percy.
On my way.

33:08.687 --> 33:11.657
* And I thought I was ready

33:11.690 --> 33:13.392
* Ready for someone else

33:13.425 --> 33:15.094
SONJA:
Damn it.

33:15.127 --> 33:17.263
You got eyes
on the other gunman?

33:17.296 --> 33:18.397
GREGORIO:
No, it's Tita.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.666
KC must have sent her
to make the deal in his place.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.134
What a coward.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.736
* And I didn't need no help

33:24.770 --> 33:27.039
* Every time
I get ahead of myself *

33:27.073 --> 33:28.740
* Every time...

33:28.774 --> 33:31.543
SONJA:
Natali just spotted her, too.

33:31.577 --> 33:32.478
Wait.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.748
Guys, I lost the visual.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.550
Near the concession stand.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.119
* Yeah, baby

33:40.152 --> 33:43.222
* Get ahead of myself

33:43.255 --> 33:45.524
* Yeah, baby

33:45.557 --> 33:49.095
* I get ahead
of myself... *

33:49.128 --> 33:50.229
Where's your boyfriend?

33:50.262 --> 33:51.330
Close by.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.232
NATALI:
And my diamonds?

33:53.265 --> 33:55.401
With KC.
You give me the money

33:55.434 --> 33:57.669
and I'll tell you
where they are.

33:57.703 --> 33:58.804
I got Boro.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.239
He's behind Tita.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.473
I'm engaging, Pride.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.242
Hang on, I'm almost there.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.543
That's not how this works.

34:08.314 --> 34:09.515
Call KC now

34:09.548 --> 34:12.484
and have him come here.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.220
GREGORIO:
Pride, he's got a knife.
All right, hold tight.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.154
I'm on my way!

34:15.187 --> 34:17.256
Or what?

34:17.289 --> 34:18.357
Or we're going to hurt you.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.360
NCIS! Hands where...
(gunshots)

34:22.594 --> 34:24.296
Run, Tita, run!

34:24.330 --> 34:25.231
Gregorio, what the hell?!

34:25.264 --> 34:27.199
(gunshots)

34:44.816 --> 34:46.818
* Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

34:46.852 --> 34:48.720
* Whoo, hoo,
hoo, hoo *

34:48.754 --> 34:52.358
* Whoo, hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo

34:52.391 --> 34:53.625
* The devil you know

34:53.659 --> 34:55.661
* Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

34:55.694 --> 34:57.496
We're pinned down.
We need backup.

34:57.529 --> 35:00.266
All right, hold tight, King.
We're on our way.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.068
* The devil you know

35:06.938 --> 35:08.307
(gunshots)

35:10.676 --> 35:12.211
* Come on

35:14.680 --> 35:17.149
Natali's going after Tita.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.485
I'm going after her. I have to.
No, it's not safe. Hold on.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.653
No, I can't. I have to.
Gregorio!

35:21.687 --> 35:22.554
Damn it!

35:22.588 --> 35:24.423
* Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

35:24.456 --> 35:26.858
* Whoo, hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo

35:26.892 --> 35:29.195
* The devil you know

35:29.228 --> 35:30.896
PRIDE:
Don't move.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.301
Where's Gregorio?

35:35.334 --> 35:36.935
She went after
Natali and Tita.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.637
What can we do?
Call this in.

35:38.670 --> 35:39.771
I'm going after
Gregorio.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.376
(ducks quacking)

35:46.578 --> 35:48.247
KC?

35:48.280 --> 35:50.516
Yo. You get the money?

35:50.549 --> 35:51.883
No. They tried to kill me.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.185
We have to get out of here.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.886
Let me get the diamonds.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.723
There's no time, KC.
He's right behind us.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.725
Yeah, I'm not
leaving without 'em.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.927
You see this?
This is gonna change...

36:01.960 --> 36:04.396
(gunshots)

36:04.430 --> 36:05.764
KC!

36:16.675 --> 36:18.844
Why did you
have to make this so hard?

36:20.312 --> 36:21.913
(gunshot)

36:26.852 --> 36:28.520
(crying)

36:28.554 --> 36:29.521
(sirens wailing in distance)

36:37.296 --> 36:38.597
All clear.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.502
Tita's safe.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.971
Natali's dead.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.814
KC's dead, too.

37:07.293 --> 37:08.694
Can't believe he's gone.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.430
I should've tried harder
to get him away.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.698
None of this is on you.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.500
It's gonna take some
time to understand,

37:14.533 --> 37:16.435
but KC made some
bad choices.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.437
You don't have to.

37:18.470 --> 37:19.971
What's that mean?

37:20.005 --> 37:21.373
It means you need to take

37:21.407 --> 37:24.376
some responsibility
for yourself.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.645
Focus on
the future.

37:26.678 --> 37:28.347
I don't have one of those.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.015
Sure you do.

37:31.517 --> 37:35.454
So this is the part
where you hand me off to DCFS.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.755
(sighs)

37:36.788 --> 37:38.724
Yeah.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.526
This is the part.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.394
But it's also
the part

37:42.428 --> 37:44.596
where you realize
it's the right thing to do.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.300
I'll just get lost
in the shuffle,

37:48.334 --> 37:49.535
end up in some group home.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.703
No, you won't.
Because I'm gonna

37:51.737 --> 37:53.572
be by your side
every step of the way

37:53.605 --> 37:55.407
to make sure you stay on course.

37:55.441 --> 37:57.576
Like I said,

37:57.609 --> 37:59.010
I got your back.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.480
For real?

38:01.513 --> 38:02.781
You can bank on it.

38:19.431 --> 38:20.899
How'd she take it?

38:20.932 --> 38:22.401
Better than I expected.

38:22.434 --> 38:26.071
I just hope she doesn't
run away again.

38:26.104 --> 38:30.041
Oh. To find her way back
to our place, no doubt.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.910
But that's where
you will be staying

38:31.943 --> 38:33.379
until we find you
a good home.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.113
What?
Right, good girl?

38:35.146 --> 38:36.715
When did we agree on that?

38:36.748 --> 38:38.950
Oh, so you're the only one

38:38.984 --> 38:40.819
who can bring in strays
off the street?

38:40.852 --> 38:42.421
Don't start. This is a dog.
Really?

38:42.454 --> 38:43.855
Please.

38:43.889 --> 38:47.359
Oh, Percy, I just hope
DCFS does right by her.

38:47.393 --> 38:48.494
PRIDE:
They will.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.095
I made sure of it.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.763
How'd you manage that?

38:51.797 --> 38:54.533
By eating a lot of crow
with Dan Young.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.602
I promised to...

38:56.635 --> 38:58.670
stay out of his business
from now on.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.473
And he promised to place Tita

39:01.507 --> 39:04.643
and Lil Man
in foster care together.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.778
They'll be together
no matter what happens.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.480
What about the other
gutter punks?

39:08.514 --> 39:10.482
Got some ideas about them, too.

39:10.516 --> 39:13.051
The acting mayor and I
are currently on good terms.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.854
Thought she might work out
some transitional housing.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.856
Loretta's gonna
broach the subject.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.993
I try to clean up my messes.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.962
Yeah?

39:23.995 --> 39:27.399
Maybe next time,
double up on the therapy.

39:27.433 --> 39:28.900
I'll take it under advisement.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.504
I'd like a word with you.

39:34.506 --> 39:36.975
Upstairs.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.518
Need to talk about
what happened today.

39:46.552 --> 39:49.054
We stopped the bad guys
and got Tita to safety.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.689
What's to say?

39:50.722 --> 39:52.824
Well, let's start with
you disobeying orders

39:52.858 --> 39:54.626
and jeopardizing lives.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.995
I made a judgment call based on
my reading of the situation,

39:57.028 --> 39:58.430
like you always do.

39:58.464 --> 40:00.866
You acted impulsively,
Gregorio.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.535
Opening fire when
I told you not to.

40:03.569 --> 40:06.004
Chasing after Natali
when it wasn't safe.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.539
Let me ask you a question.
You're the only one

40:07.573 --> 40:08.874
that gets to work on instinct?

40:08.907 --> 40:10.642
Call an audible?
It's my team.

40:10.676 --> 40:11.977
It's my call.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.945
Wow, that's some real
Washington-level BS

40:13.979 --> 40:16.147
right there, Pride.
Chain of command.

40:16.181 --> 40:18.149
Not about chain of command.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.951
It's about consequences.

40:19.985 --> 40:22.954
When I take a risk, I'm
willing to take the hit.

40:22.988 --> 40:24.823
Not just for me.

40:24.856 --> 40:26.892
For all of us.
You're giving me grief
for a trigger

40:26.925 --> 40:29.227
you would've pulled
without a second thought.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.063
It's not that simple, Tammy.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.933
You want us to trust you?

40:34.966 --> 40:36.234
Back your plays,

40:36.267 --> 40:38.937
follow your instincts,
no matter what it costs?

40:38.970 --> 40:41.507
You got to trust us back.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.476
Maybe so.

40:44.510 --> 40:46.645
Nonetheless...

40:46.678 --> 40:48.113
I'm the boss.

40:48.146 --> 40:51.550
And I make the calls,
right or wrong.

40:51.583 --> 40:54.219
Don't you ever pull a
stunt like that again.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.921
You got it?

40:55.954 --> 40:58.456
Yeah. I got it.

41:01.527 --> 41:03.729
(door opens, slams)
