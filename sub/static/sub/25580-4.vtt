00:00.400 --> 00:02.920
I presume you've seen the news
about the Hayley Reid case?

00:03.000 --> 00:05.210
The police think
she may have been our cleaner.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.600
I told them we all stayed
in the house that night,

00:07.760 --> 00:09.160
eating with our families.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.160
I have a daughter Maya,

00:11.250 --> 00:13.560
who I last saw 17 years ago.

00:13.630 --> 00:14.710
Three grand.

00:14.760 --> 00:18.520
I accidentally paid Salthouse's
cheque into my personal account.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.880
This isn't working, Pete,
you and me.

00:21.050 --> 00:22.170
Your marriage ended when?

00:22.240 --> 00:24.560
I haven't seen Derran
for many years,

00:24.760 --> 00:28.280
but I should just say that
she's had a number of issues.

00:28.430 --> 00:31.390
Christmas and New Year
can be quite stressful, can't it?

00:31.440 --> 00:33.150
Of the three of you
that were married,

00:33.240 --> 00:35.400
all of you were separated
within the year.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.520
That was nothing to do with anything
that happened on that break.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.160
No, it wasn't a pleasant evening.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.240
Someone might have bought some coke.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.920
Chris went completely nuts.

00:45.180 --> 00:47.940
There was another employee.
She went as Madonna

00:48.010 --> 00:49.110
and she left around 12:10.

00:49.170 --> 00:51.850
So she could have actually left
the pub earlier.

00:51.940 --> 00:55.490
We now have four men,
variously pissed, drugged up,

00:55.540 --> 00:58.550
possibly mentally unstable,
out somewhere in Middenham

00:58.630 --> 01:00.790
at exactly the same time as Hayley.

on the church break-in.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.930
Wow, who?

01:54.780 --> 01:56.260
Pete Carr.

Bad man! Stop!

Oh...! Argh...!

02:07.040 --> 02:09.680
Pete, please, they're supposed
to be eating breakfast!

02:09.979 --> 02:12.460
Oh, I'm sorry.
Go on, Will, do as your mum says.

02:12.620 --> 02:14.420
PHONE JINGLE

02:22.370 --> 02:23.390
Pete Carr.

02:23.430 --> 02:25.190
Mr Carr, DI Sunil Khan.

02:25.540 --> 02:27.050
Hi, morning.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.160
Mr Carr,
we need to speak to you again.

02:30.450 --> 02:31.930
Do you? About what?

02:33.600 --> 02:35.360
Well, we can discuss that
when we meet.

02:35.410 --> 02:38.540
We'd like you to be King's Lynn
police station at 1:30, please.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.510
Do I need a...
a lawyer or anything?

02:41.530 --> 02:43.690
I'm afraid I can't advise you
on legal representation.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.320
But we will be looking to
interview you under caution, so...

02:47.480 --> 02:48.580
Right, sure.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.560
Good. See you later. Bye.
Bye.

02:54.310 --> 02:56.140
Do you need a lawyer for what?

02:56.860 --> 02:58.580
The new FSA contracts.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.040
I was just asking Mark
if we need to run them by a lawyer.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.760
He says they're all fine.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.640
Come on.
Come and eat your breakfast.

03:10.720 --> 03:14.630
So DI Khan and I are heading
straight up to Norfolk now,

03:14.650 --> 03:16.690
following on from that DNA result.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.880
Although, obviously,
there are some questions

03:18.920 --> 03:20.500
for them all to answer now,

03:20.600 --> 03:24.880
following Melissa Hollis's
ever so slightly different account

03:25.430 --> 03:26.500
of that evening.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.300
Jake, it might be worth
speaking to Tim Finch's ex,

03:29.350 --> 03:31.550
see how she remembers the evening.
Guv.

03:31.570 --> 03:34.250
And James Hollis finally came back
about his car.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.090
It turns out he was driving
a black four-door BMW

03:37.600 --> 03:38.820
with a tow bar.

03:38.850 --> 03:40.530
Do you know if he had a trailer?

03:40.810 --> 03:41.860
Yeah.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.880
Interesting.

03:43.490 --> 03:46.540
And all this,
it feeds into a bigger question

03:46.590 --> 03:48.250
that I think we need to ask now.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.650
Because,
if what Melissa Hollis said is true,

03:51.060 --> 03:53.980
it means that not only did
all four men lie to us...

03:54.400 --> 03:58.240
..all four then appear
to have colluded in that lie.

03:58.290 --> 04:01.270
And at that point, I start to ask,

04:01.490 --> 04:02.770
why would they do that?

04:02.900 --> 04:04.460
Do you think they're all involved,
boss?

04:04.550 --> 04:07.350
I don't know. But I think
it has to be one of our options.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.170
Or maybe it's that one of them
killed her...

04:11.060 --> 04:13.220
..and the other three
covered up for him.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.839
Anyway, let's let that percolate

04:16.880 --> 04:20.190
and then we'll regroup
once we've spoken to Mr Carr.

04:20.779 --> 04:22.100
Thank you, everyone.

04:22.310 --> 04:23.910
Are you driving or me?

04:25.080 --> 04:26.760
TEXT MESSAGE BEEP

04:37.910 --> 04:39.230
Can we sue the site?

04:39.280 --> 04:42.290
We can try, but it's registered
to a 27-year-old woman

04:42.350 --> 04:44.030
that lives in a council flat.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.710
She literally has nothing to lose.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.470
Well, we've got to do something,
Linda.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.840
If you type me and Hayley Reid's
name into a search engine,

04:50.040 --> 04:52.290
those photographs come up
on three other sites already.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.600
And I've got a guy working
to get them taken down.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.500
I'm doing everything I can.
PHONE RINGS

04:56.530 --> 04:57.650
Call me back.

04:59.070 --> 05:00.070
Amy.

05:00.090 --> 05:03.040
Morning, James, do you wish
to comment on your connection to...?

05:09.080 --> 05:10.520
Daily Mirror, Mr Hollis.

05:10.590 --> 05:14.350
Are there any comment you'd like
to make about the Hayley Reid case?

05:15.170 --> 05:16.890
Did you stay long last night?

05:17.480 --> 05:20.000
No.
Left about half an hour after you.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.280
Knackered.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.640
Er, long enough for him
to ask me out to dinner, though.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.080
Don't.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.960
Er, I didn't...

05:36.510 --> 05:38.470
SUNNY CLEARS HIS THROAT

05:42.270 --> 05:44.590
They did the same with me.
It's what they do.

05:44.740 --> 05:46.380
It doesn't mean anything, I promise.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.320
And I asked for someone
to be with me.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.420
I told her, you know, the problem,
and she just ignored me.

05:51.550 --> 05:53.520
You explicitly asked her
for someone?

05:53.560 --> 05:54.970
Yes. Yes, definitely.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.310
Jesus, outrageous! How dare she?

05:58.880 --> 06:03.000
Listen, I have to shoot but,
if you're happy for me to do it,

06:03.040 --> 06:05.200
I'll make a formal complaint
on your behalf.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.800
Well, yeah. OK, yeah.

06:07.930 --> 06:09.690
Thank you.
No, I just...

06:10.990 --> 06:12.310
These people.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.150
I've just come off the phone
from an Inspector Chan in Hong Kong.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.400
And it turns out
he knew Peter Carr very well.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.460
Tell me.

06:22.540 --> 06:24.680
So, in 1985,
when Carr was living there...

06:24.970 --> 06:28.330
We've all been through some shit,
Chris, all done stuff....

06:29.440 --> 06:31.280
..we shouldn't have.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.370
So I'm just saying,

06:33.800 --> 06:35.440
you'll always be my friend, mate,

06:35.720 --> 06:37.240
no matter what.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.400
I love you, mate.
Yeah.

06:46.870 --> 06:48.350
Love you, too.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.680
CAR STARTS

06:54.960 --> 06:58.250
So I am going to ask you again,
Mr Carr...

06:59.050 --> 07:01.240
..were you in the house all evening?

07:02.720 --> 07:05.080
Not all evening, no.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.000
I was in the pub for a...

07:08.240 --> 07:09.480
..a fair bit.

07:09.990 --> 07:12.150
And that's from what time
to what time?

07:12.750 --> 07:14.230
From about...

07:14.270 --> 07:17.320
..8:30 to just before midnight.
Mm-hm.

07:18.570 --> 07:21.970
So why didn't you just tell us that?
I don't know, I...

07:22.320 --> 07:23.760
It was stupid.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.440
I just panicked, I suppose.

07:27.490 --> 07:31.240
I was on a bit of a pub crawl.
I was on my own.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.320
I guess I thought that didn't put me
in a good light.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.720
In relation to Hayley Reid, I mean.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.760
So I... I just said
I was in the house with the others.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.920
You said that
you were on a pub crawl.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.120
Yes.

07:44.150 --> 07:46.240
Did you pass St Matthew's church
on the way back?

07:47.240 --> 07:49.200
No.
Are you sure?

07:49.930 --> 07:50.960
Yes.

07:52.360 --> 07:56.680
Are you sure you didn't, in fact,
break into St Matthew's church

07:56.880 --> 07:59.800
and steal some silverware
from a cupboard in the vestry?

08:01.040 --> 08:02.960
We have a DNA match to you,

08:03.120 --> 08:05.800
from blood samples taken at the time

08:06.000 --> 08:09.150
from the window that you smashed
to get in.

08:11.050 --> 08:12.770
Was that you?

08:16.320 --> 08:17.350
Yes.

08:18.210 --> 08:19.330
I was, er...

08:20.510 --> 08:23.570
My company was having
some cash flow issues and, er...

08:23.890 --> 08:26.240
..with all the Christmas
and New Year expenditure,

08:26.280 --> 08:28.000
I found I didn't have enough money

08:28.040 --> 08:30.350
for my flight back to Hong Kong,
so...

08:33.960 --> 08:36.120
I'd been in there
the previous evening...

08:37.280 --> 08:38.880
..to a service...

08:39.400 --> 08:41.520
..and seen the silverware and...

08:47.320 --> 08:51.490
It was an utterly shameful thing
to do and I am so sorry.

09:04.780 --> 09:06.020
Are you OK?

09:06.200 --> 09:07.480
Yeah, fine.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.100
Not having second thoughts?

09:17.160 --> 09:18.180
Never.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.780
Never. No.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.200
I'm just tired.
Good.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.240
I wish to introduce evidence
of bad character

09:33.400 --> 09:35.520
under the Criminal Justice Act 2001.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.240
See, we've been speaking
to the Hong Kong police.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.840
Do you want to tell us
about the three-month sentence

09:42.040 --> 09:46.320
that you served in 1995
in Lo Wu Correctional Facility

09:46.520 --> 09:50.860
for defrauding a disability charity
of $100,000,

09:50.920 --> 09:53.880
an amount which caused it
to close down?

09:54.500 --> 09:55.800
I was set up.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.620
That was all.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.630
The system out there was corrupt.
I was set up.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.710
Really?
Yes, fucking really!

10:05.000 --> 10:08.080
You see, I think you give
a very good impression

10:08.280 --> 10:12.080
of being a decent, if slightly
hapless businessman, Peter.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.040
But I think you have
a much darker side.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.380
Do you?
Yes, I do.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.880
I think you have a side that thinks
primarily of what you need.

10:19.970 --> 10:21.230
Maybe once.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.380
Not now.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.920
Well, indeed, because I think,
when you broke into that church,

10:26.040 --> 10:28.200
that was exactly
what you were thinking,

10:28.240 --> 10:30.560
"How do I get myself
out of this hole?"

10:30.760 --> 10:33.520
But I would never have hurt anyone.
I'm sure you didn't plan to.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.080
But then, maybe...

10:35.380 --> 10:38.740
..maybe Hayley saw you go in
and she confronted you.

10:38.760 --> 10:42.140
Now, you knew she could
identify you from the Spinney.

10:42.190 --> 10:43.270
No.

10:43.290 --> 10:46.160
So you did what you needed to do
to protect your needs.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.440
Not true.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.780
Except you've lied to us, Peter...

10:50.520 --> 10:52.080
..from the moment we spoke to you,

10:52.100 --> 10:54.240
so why should we suddenly
start believing you now?

10:59.040 --> 11:01.640
Can I get through, please?
REPORTERS SHOUT QUESTIONS

11:01.800 --> 11:03.400
Excuse me. Out of my way, please.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.920
Thank you.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.640
SHOUTED QUESTIONS CONTINUE

11:17.930 --> 11:20.130
When exactly
where you planning to tell me?

11:27.160 --> 11:28.840
SHE SIGHS

11:29.510 --> 11:31.240
What do you think?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.320
He's clearly a fraud.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.920
And weak.

11:35.430 --> 11:37.070
And a liar.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.160
The question is,
do I sense violence?

11:40.770 --> 11:41.920
I don't know.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.730
I wouldn't want to see him
backed into a corner, though.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.200
Tell me what's going on,

12:04.400 --> 12:07.680
or I swear I will go in there
right now and ask them myself.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.610
OK, right, well, that seems to chime

12:27.810 --> 12:31.010
pretty much with what Melissa Hollis
told us.

12:31.170 --> 12:33.770
And, erm... what's my ex said,

12:33.970 --> 12:36.290
what's Timothy said
about the evening?

12:36.490 --> 12:40.050
I'm afraid I can't really go into
too many details about that.

12:41.290 --> 12:44.130
It's just, when you rang,
it wasn't a complete shock.

12:45.610 --> 12:46.680
I'm sorry?

12:46.710 --> 12:48.930
I think,
on some subconscious level...

12:49.790 --> 12:52.210
..I had always wondered.
Well, wondered what?

12:52.290 --> 12:54.130
If he could have been involved.

12:55.190 --> 12:57.830
I mean, I'm sure he's told you
I'm delusional...

12:58.860 --> 13:00.260
..and a fantasist.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.260
Mad.

13:03.330 --> 13:06.930
And maybe I have had periods when
I've not acted entirely rationally.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.100
I know I've alienated
my daughters and...

13:13.010 --> 13:16.170
..and I'm incredibly sad
about that, but...

13:17.720 --> 13:20.570
..the way I've been, what I became,

13:20.770 --> 13:22.990
that was actually
entirely because of him.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.030
Dr Finch?
Yes.

13:25.210 --> 13:27.090
How do you mean?
I mean...

13:27.900 --> 13:30.770
..to talk to,
on the face of it, in public...

13:32.080 --> 13:35.120
..you would think he was
such a lovely man, wouldn't you?

13:35.230 --> 13:38.350
Kind and gentle...

13:38.730 --> 13:39.990
..and good.

13:40.060 --> 13:44.430
"A good man" was how people
always described him in our village.

13:46.610 --> 13:50.050
But behind closed doors, he's the
most manipulative, calculating man

13:50.070 --> 13:52.780
I've ever met and
he made my life a complete misery.

13:54.520 --> 13:55.640
How so?

13:56.460 --> 13:58.400
For the 13 years
that we were married,

13:58.430 --> 14:01.080
he tried to control
every single aspect of it.

14:02.510 --> 14:04.750
He stopped me from working.

14:04.870 --> 14:06.860
He cut me off from my friends.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.570
He stopped me going out at all
by the end.

14:11.990 --> 14:16.020
Well, he abused me mentally,
physically...

14:18.130 --> 14:20.290
..sometimes even sexually.

14:21.100 --> 14:24.120
And if I hadn't managed
to escaped when I did...

14:25.360 --> 14:28.240
..who knows what he might have
ended up doing?

14:34.350 --> 14:35.940
Four days ago?

14:35.990 --> 14:38.250
Obviously, just as a witness, so...

14:38.520 --> 14:39.640
So...?

14:39.730 --> 14:42.570
So, what? So that means
you didn't need to mention it to me.

14:42.730 --> 14:44.410
I'm sorry, I should have.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.470
How do you even do that?

14:46.530 --> 14:50.210
We've been out to dinner,
we've had a million conversations,

14:50.370 --> 14:52.730
we've had sex, and I...

14:52.930 --> 14:55.810
..never once had an inkling
that you were lying to me.

14:56.010 --> 14:58.530
I never lied. Oh, please,
by omission, yes, you lied.

14:58.730 --> 15:01.530
PHONE JINGLE
Just leave the phone, Jamie....

15:01.730 --> 15:03.930
It's my agent.
She's rung three times already.

15:04.090 --> 15:05.370
Sue...

15:12.170 --> 15:13.930
I'll call you back.

15:16.930 --> 15:19.090
They're suspending recordings
for a month.

15:20.090 --> 15:21.210
SHE SCOFFS

15:24.290 --> 15:26.450
So, is there anything else
you haven't told me?

15:30.770 --> 15:32.330
Jesus, you're...

15:32.530 --> 15:34.410
..you're meant to say no
really quickly.

15:34.610 --> 15:37.570
You're meant to get really cross and
say, "No, of course there isn't!"

15:37.770 --> 15:40.370
No, of course there isn't.
I need to speak to my solicitor.

15:40.530 --> 15:41.850
Well, don't just walk out now!

15:45.250 --> 15:46.810
Oh, hi, Usha. It's me.

15:47.010 --> 15:50.490
Sunil, I can't really talk
right now. I'm at work.

15:50.690 --> 15:52.850
But I was wondering,
could we meet up?

15:53.970 --> 15:55.450
Er, why?

15:56.490 --> 15:58.770
I'd really prefer not to say
over the phone.

15:58.930 --> 16:01.050
I'd prefer to see you in person.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.890
Right.

16:03.050 --> 16:04.850
I really wouldn't.

16:06.130 --> 16:09.530
Look, I know you have every right
to be angry with me, Sunny.

16:09.690 --> 16:11.370
I know how much I hurt you.

16:13.050 --> 16:15.490
But I've been doing
a lot of soul searching recently.

16:17.130 --> 16:18.570
And I've realised...

16:19.610 --> 16:21.010
..I made a terrible mistake.

16:21.170 --> 16:23.490
I miss you and the girls.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.770
I miss us all living together.

16:27.850 --> 16:29.570
I want to come back.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.690
HE SIGHS HEAVILY

16:33.890 --> 16:35.610
And has she got any proof
of anything?

16:35.770 --> 16:36.970
Oh, I asked her exactly that.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.850
Which didn't go down very well.

16:39.050 --> 16:41.730
She got slightly defensive
and asked me to leave.

16:41.930 --> 16:44.410
But what was your general sense
of her, as a person?

16:44.570 --> 16:46.690
Did she...? Did she feel credible?

16:48.010 --> 16:51.010
It's hard to say. She certainly
felt like a very damaged woman.

16:51.210 --> 16:55.210
If that make her more or less
credible, I don't know, Guv.

16:56.330 --> 16:59.170
OK, let's go for a Section 23
for her medical records,

16:59.370 --> 17:02.650
see if what Finch said about her
mental health was true. Speak later.

17:02.810 --> 17:03.850
Guv.

17:07.690 --> 17:10.010
HE STARTS THE CAR

17:10.170 --> 17:11.329
Are you all right?

17:13.490 --> 17:15.650
Not really, no.

17:15.810 --> 17:17.050
Talk to me.

17:25.810 --> 17:29.290
It was a day centre for adults
with learning difficulties.

17:29.490 --> 17:32.010
I met the team who ran it
at a charity function

17:32.210 --> 17:35.250
and it turns out they needed someone
to restructure their finances,

17:35.410 --> 17:37.330
so I offered my services.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.650
I genuinely wanted to help them.

17:40.690 --> 17:42.290
And then...

17:42.490 --> 17:45.890
..my business started having
some cash flow issues and, er...

17:47.890 --> 17:50.650
I only ever intended
to borrow the money, Maria.

17:50.810 --> 17:52.370
I was always going to pay it back.

17:53.850 --> 17:57.210
Then a tax demand came in earlier
than expected and...

17:59.530 --> 18:01.530
It was all just bad timing.

18:02.650 --> 18:04.890
No-one was more upset than me

18:05.090 --> 18:07.050
when they were evicted,
I promise you.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.530
And the church thing...

18:13.010 --> 18:14.410
No excuses.

18:16.050 --> 18:18.170
Which is what I told the police.

18:18.370 --> 18:21.090
I deserve to be charged.
I deserve to be punished.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.370
It was a terrible thing to do.

18:23.410 --> 18:25.090
But that is it, Maria.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.130
That is everything.

18:27.290 --> 18:28.610
I promise.

18:30.130 --> 18:33.810
I had nothing to do
with that poor girl's death.

18:35.210 --> 18:38.090
And I'm telling you all of this
because

18:38.290 --> 18:42.210
I want you to know the very worst
things that I've done...

18:43.530 --> 18:46.410
..and to assure you
that I have changed.

18:47.770 --> 18:50.890
You and the boys have changed me,
Maria.

18:52.250 --> 18:54.010
I'm not that man any more.

18:58.210 --> 19:00.570
Thank you for finally
being honest with me, Pete.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.250
I appreciate that. I really do.

19:04.450 --> 19:08.690
And I accept
you never meant to do any harm.

19:08.890 --> 19:11.730
I don't think you ever set out
to harm.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.050
But let's just be clear...

19:17.730 --> 19:20.130
..you only told me
because I made you.

19:22.290 --> 19:26.210
And you are deluded
if you think this ushers in

19:26.370 --> 19:28.330
some new chapter in our lives.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.690
Maz...
And more importantly,

19:30.730 --> 19:35.010
if you think
I will allow my children

19:35.170 --> 19:37.290
to be brought up by a man like you,

19:37.450 --> 19:41.010
who steals from the disabled

19:41.170 --> 19:42.650
and from old men...

19:44.650 --> 19:46.410
..and worse.

19:46.610 --> 19:50.450
A man who's been lying to himself
for so many years,

19:50.650 --> 19:53.250
he doesn't even know
what the truth is any more.

19:54.490 --> 19:58.050
I think you could have killed
that poor girl...

19:59.770 --> 20:03.490
..and you could still sit here
opposite me

20:03.650 --> 20:05.970
swearing it wasn't you,

20:06.130 --> 20:08.410
and actually believe it yourself.

20:08.570 --> 20:11.370
Maria, I did not kill her.

20:12.850 --> 20:14.370
It's finished, Pete.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.410
Maria...

20:19.570 --> 20:21.370
Get your fucking hand off me!

20:21.570 --> 20:23.010
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

20:23.050 --> 20:24.290
I'm sorry.

20:46.890 --> 20:48.330
I'm not saying that.

20:48.490 --> 20:50.290
You literally just did.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.050
What I said was you've been...

20:55.130 --> 20:57.690
..forgetting lots of things
recently.

20:57.850 --> 20:59.970
And why not have a test,

21:00.010 --> 21:01.410
put your mind at rest?

21:01.570 --> 21:03.410
My mind is at rest.

21:03.570 --> 21:04.690
OK, mine, then.

21:04.890 --> 21:07.050
Because it's not that relaxing
wondering if...

21:07.090 --> 21:09.330
..if today's the day
you're going to burn the house down.

21:11.010 --> 21:12.530
Sorry, I meant...

21:14.530 --> 21:17.490
I think you need to take
a bit of a look at yourself, Cass.

21:17.690 --> 21:20.170
Oh, really, is that a dad lecture
coming up, is it?

21:20.370 --> 21:22.890
Well, you clearly don't want me
to be with Jenny. Not true.

21:23.090 --> 21:25.930
You clearly think she's trying
to fleece me. Er, a little bit.

21:26.130 --> 21:29.290
And I'm guessing
suggesting that I have dementia

21:29.490 --> 21:31.930
is just another way of trying
to scupper the relationship.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.410
But actually... the problem is you.

21:34.570 --> 21:36.770
Is it? How's that, then?

21:36.970 --> 21:39.890
Well, you don't want me to leave,
my love, because you're lonely.

21:40.050 --> 21:41.890
And I understand that. I really do.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.170
But I probably am going.

21:45.450 --> 21:47.250
And I probably am going
to marry her.

21:47.410 --> 21:48.410
Hm...

21:50.210 --> 21:52.090
And you need to accept that.

21:56.210 --> 21:57.610
DOOR CLOSES

22:00.010 --> 22:03.210
And of course Robert, the central
male character of your first novel,

22:03.410 --> 22:06.570
was a working-class
grammar school boy,

22:06.770 --> 22:08.690
who became
a very successful journalist.

22:08.890 --> 22:11.050
This felt like
a very personal story.

22:12.290 --> 22:13.890
Well, er...

22:14.090 --> 22:16.530
..the pain that the character
of Annie goes through,

22:16.730 --> 22:19.410
as she discovers her husband
has been serially unfaithful,

22:19.610 --> 22:22.250
was something I did feel
I understood.

22:23.770 --> 22:25.930
But what I wanted
to try and explore,

22:25.970 --> 22:27.770
through his multiple liaisons,

22:27.930 --> 22:29.810
was what it was in the male psyche

22:30.010 --> 22:34.970
that needed
this constant sexual validation.

22:35.130 --> 22:37.050
ON RADIO: I mean, was this, in fact,

22:37.250 --> 22:39.410
just a normal extension
of male sexual identity

22:39.450 --> 22:42.530
or did it suggest something darker,

22:42.690 --> 22:44.610
something more aberrant?

23:12.730 --> 23:14.610
Who got her this?

23:14.770 --> 23:16.530
We had a collection, my team.

23:17.610 --> 23:19.130
Obviously, you'll want to, erm...

23:20.730 --> 23:22.890
..choose your own for the funeral,
but...

23:24.210 --> 23:27.570
..bring her here, we all wanted
something nice for her.

23:27.730 --> 23:28.810
Thank you.

23:29.850 --> 23:31.290
Thank all your team, please.

23:42.930 --> 23:46.170
I've asked, when we bury her,
for them to arrange her...

23:47.610 --> 23:49.770
..her bones, properly.

23:51.290 --> 23:54.530
And they're not to leave her
anywhere in the dark before then.

23:55.730 --> 23:57.410
She didn't like the dark.

24:04.930 --> 24:07.330
I miss you, my darling sister.

24:09.010 --> 24:11.130
I love you.

24:37.330 --> 24:41.090
I paid you your settlement, Derran,
in full, 15 years ago.

24:41.290 --> 24:43.890
So you say.
No, so the court says.

24:45.530 --> 24:46.970
I want the rest of it.

24:48.290 --> 24:49.690
Or you will regret it.

24:50.730 --> 24:52.650
And why will I regret it?

24:52.850 --> 24:55.170
Because I have evidence
of what you did to me

24:55.370 --> 24:58.250
and I don't think you want them
to see that, do you, the police?

24:58.410 --> 24:59.410
Not right now.

25:00.410 --> 25:03.530
Oh, right, so you're blackmailing
me now, are you?

25:04.650 --> 25:06.930
I just want what you owe me.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.170
OK. And how much
do we think that is, then?

25:11.730 --> 25:13.050
50,000.

25:17.090 --> 25:20.570
You see, if you'd pitched it
a little more realistically,

25:20.770 --> 25:22.930
you might have got
ten grand out of me,

25:22.970 --> 25:24.010
just to be rid of you.

25:25.530 --> 25:27.450
But you always were a bit dim.

25:28.970 --> 25:32.370
OK, go to the police,
tell them what the fuck you like,

25:32.570 --> 25:34.530
but you're not getting anything
out of me.

25:34.690 --> 25:36.690
And if you come back here again,

25:36.850 --> 25:38.450
I'll call the police for you.

25:55.010 --> 25:56.850
Carol, call me
when you get this, please.

25:57.050 --> 25:58.730
I need to talk to you
about something.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.210
It's fairly urgent.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.890
TYRES SCREECH

26:09.570 --> 26:12.130
And when did you last speak
to your father, Miss Lowe?

26:12.330 --> 26:14.890
The last contact I had with him
was when Mum died, six years ago.

26:15.010 --> 26:16.530
I wrote to him via his friend Tim.

26:16.730 --> 26:18.890
So you haven't actually spoken
since...?

26:19.050 --> 26:20.610
The day Mum threw him out.

26:20.770 --> 26:21.970
Right.

26:23.050 --> 26:25.810
So, we spoke to your father

26:26.010 --> 26:27.970
and we spoke to
his ex-business partner.

26:28.130 --> 26:29.370
Helen.

26:29.530 --> 26:30.690
Yes.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.290
And they both offered a slight...

26:33.530 --> 26:37.370
..lack of clarity as to why
he stood down from his own company

26:37.530 --> 26:39.650
and why the marriage then failed.

26:39.810 --> 26:42.250
We wondered if maybe...

26:42.410 --> 26:44.370
..you could clarify anything.

26:44.530 --> 26:46.410
The two things were connected.

26:46.570 --> 26:48.970
They split because, in October 1999,

26:49.170 --> 26:51.330
police officers arrested him
at his office

26:51.370 --> 26:53.370
as an early part
of the Landmark case.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.610
Basically, he'd used his credit card
to visit child abuse websites.

26:58.170 --> 27:00.450
A couple of months later,
despite him begging her not to,

27:00.610 --> 27:02.450
Helen told Mum.

27:02.610 --> 27:04.010
Is that enough detail?

27:05.050 --> 27:06.050
Yes.

27:06.170 --> 27:07.930
Thank you.

27:31.470 --> 27:32.490
Mel!

27:32.790 --> 27:34.110
Why would you do that?

27:34.200 --> 27:36.720
Why would you go on national radio
and talk about him like that?

27:36.750 --> 27:39.130
I think you know why.
Because you're lonely and bitter?

27:39.180 --> 27:42.190
Because you can't bear to see him
happy? I've always liked you, Amy.

27:42.450 --> 27:44.730
I've always thought you were smart,
ballsy.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.520
I even admire the fact
that you're here right now.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.890
But that interview went out
under 24 hours ago

27:50.910 --> 27:54.000
and already I have five e-mails
from women I knew nothing about,

27:54.030 --> 27:55.580
and I knew about a lot,

27:55.960 --> 27:57.970
talking about his sexual tastes,

27:58.080 --> 28:01.520
his voracious appetite, the things
he used to ask them to do.

28:01.850 --> 28:05.090
That stuff online about him
and that poor girl scared them.

28:05.710 --> 28:06.950
And it scared me.

28:06.970 --> 28:10.290
And I'm sorry but...
it should scare you.

28:11.270 --> 28:13.830
What are you going to do with them,
the e-mails?

28:13.850 --> 28:15.730
Send them to the police, of course.
What else?

28:15.780 --> 28:17.450
That's why I did the interview.

28:27.630 --> 28:31.390
So, I've just re-checked
and we have no record

28:31.590 --> 28:33.590
of a Christopher Lowe
on our systems at all.

28:34.830 --> 28:36.150
Could he have changed his name?

28:36.350 --> 28:39.270
Well, we know his surname was Lowe
because it was in the company name.

28:39.430 --> 28:41.230
But maybe his first name?

28:41.390 --> 28:43.510
OK, we'll check. In the meantime...

28:43.710 --> 28:46.990
..Melissa Hollis
forwarded these on to me.

28:47.190 --> 28:50.230
They're from various women
James Hollis had relationships with

28:50.430 --> 28:53.430
whilst married to her
and to his current wife. Nice.

28:53.630 --> 28:56.870
They detail some of his more...
exotic exploits.

28:57.030 --> 28:59.550
A penchant for outdoor sex.

28:59.750 --> 29:03.110
One woman talks about a rape fantasy
he asked her play out.

29:03.310 --> 29:05.470
Anything illegal?
Not so far.

29:05.670 --> 29:09.270
Jake, did you manage to access
Derran Finch's medical records?

29:09.430 --> 29:11.310
Er, yeah, I did.

29:11.510 --> 29:13.670
And, basically, her ex-husband
was telling the truth.

29:13.710 --> 29:17.150
She has been treated for various
mental health issues over the years.

29:17.350 --> 29:20.230
Though, I'm not sure if they
tip over into the delusional, but...

29:20.430 --> 29:23.350
OK. Well, given what we've
just learned about Chris Lowe,

29:23.550 --> 29:26.710
I think we should prioritise him
right now. Let's get him down here.

29:28.750 --> 29:30.750
Can you tell me why you need
to speak to me again?

29:30.950 --> 29:32.670
Because I told you
everything I know.

29:32.870 --> 29:34.350
Some new information
has come to light

29:34.550 --> 29:37.270
which we'd like to go over with you.
What new information?

29:37.470 --> 29:39.750
Or I can get officers
from our Bristol police station

29:39.910 --> 29:41.230
to arrest you and bring you down.

29:41.310 --> 29:43.550
You know, my friend made
a complaint about your colleague

29:43.630 --> 29:45.150
and I just might make one about you.

29:45.310 --> 29:46.350
DI Sunil Khan.

29:46.550 --> 29:48.950
S-U-N-I-L K-H-A-N,
Bishop's Street Police Station.

29:49.150 --> 29:50.950
I can send you the right form,
if you like.

29:53.390 --> 29:56.230
Well, I suppose I can be there
by 12 tomorrow.

29:56.390 --> 29:57.830
See you at midday, Mr Lowe.

29:57.990 --> 29:58.990
SUNNY HANGS UP

30:04.590 --> 30:08.230
Then, unfortunately, the police
also then spoke to your mum,

30:08.430 --> 30:11.430
because she was obviously
at the holiday house as well.

30:11.630 --> 30:14.030
As were we, having a lovely time.
Indeed.

30:14.230 --> 30:17.670
Anyway, I don't know specifically
what she might have said to them,

30:17.870 --> 30:20.230
although I can imagine
it was fairly negative about me.

30:20.390 --> 30:22.630
But more importantly,

30:22.830 --> 30:25.750
she's now threatened
to go to the police with evidence

30:25.950 --> 30:28.390
of some wrongdoing I've apparently
committed against her...

30:30.270 --> 30:32.030
..unless I give her £50,000.

30:32.190 --> 30:33.390
What? No way!

30:33.590 --> 30:35.750
Oh, my God, that woman!
Dad, I'm so sorry.

30:35.950 --> 30:39.550
And you really don't need this
after everything else.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.670
I doubt very much
whether she'll go through with it.

30:42.870 --> 30:45.030
Not least because there is nothing,
but...

30:45.070 --> 30:47.310
Yeah, I'll be honest,
it's pretty tedious.

30:48.630 --> 30:52.270
And I'm afraid I did rather lose my
temper with her. I don't blame you.

30:52.470 --> 30:54.190
So she drove down today?
Yeah.

30:54.390 --> 30:57.190
I pretty much came straight here
from talking to her in my surgery.

30:57.390 --> 30:59.990
Jesus... And when did they first
speak to you, then, the police?

31:01.110 --> 31:03.590
Er... Monday, I think it was.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.070
Monday?

31:05.270 --> 31:07.710
Wow, that was three days ago.
Yeah, I know.

31:07.910 --> 31:09.870
I should have told you before,
but...

31:10.070 --> 31:12.550
to be honest, the whole thing
only took a couple of minutes.

31:12.750 --> 31:15.150
And if it hadn't have been
for your mother ramping things up,

31:15.350 --> 31:17.510
I probably would have forgotten
all about it.

31:17.550 --> 31:20.830
And I'm sure they're speaking
to hundreds of potential witnesses.

31:21.030 --> 31:23.630
Basically, they're speaking
to anyone and everyone

31:23.830 --> 31:26.230
who was resident in the town
that week.

31:26.430 --> 31:28.910
That poor girl's parents.
I know.

31:29.070 --> 31:30.630
It's just brutal for them.

31:30.790 --> 31:32.630
I can't even begin to imagine.

31:34.110 --> 31:36.270
Right, well,
I think a cup of tea is in order.

31:36.310 --> 31:37.550
Good idea. I'll help you.

31:44.630 --> 31:46.590
You all right, love?
Yeah, yeah. All good.

31:51.830 --> 31:53.550
Is Jake around?

31:53.710 --> 31:55.230
Left already, I think.

31:55.430 --> 31:57.870
There's a lady downstairs,
says she's Tim Finch's ex-wife

31:58.070 --> 32:00.310
and has some photos
she would like to show him.

32:01.590 --> 32:02.710
Guv...

32:02.870 --> 32:04.670
And when were these taken?

32:05.830 --> 32:07.710
Mid-to late-'90s.

32:07.870 --> 32:09.550
And who took them?

32:09.710 --> 32:11.870
My friend Keera.

32:12.070 --> 32:13.710
She used to live a few doors down
from us.

32:13.870 --> 32:15.830
Can we speak to Keera?

32:15.990 --> 32:18.110
She died in 2003.

32:18.150 --> 32:19.150
Right.

32:19.350 --> 32:21.830
And she never suggested you speak
to the police at the time?

32:22.030 --> 32:25.230
She did, but she also knew
how scared I was of him...

32:26.270 --> 32:28.230
..of what he might do if I did,

32:28.430 --> 32:30.590
so she knew
it had to be my decision.

32:30.630 --> 32:32.590
Did you ever speak to a doctor
about the injuries?

32:32.710 --> 32:34.230
I was too scared he'd find out.

32:36.110 --> 32:37.950
I have to say, Mrs Finch,

32:38.150 --> 32:40.790
we can't really see your face
in these pictures

32:40.990 --> 32:45.230
and it could be quite hard to prove
that this is actually you

32:45.390 --> 32:46.990
from over 20 years ago.

32:49.590 --> 32:50.990
Who else would it be?

32:51.150 --> 32:52.230
Well, I don't know, but....

32:52.350 --> 32:54.670
Why else would I drive
all the way down here?

32:55.990 --> 32:58.270
I have nothing to gain
from doing this.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.670
I just want to help you catch
that poor little girl's killer.

33:04.630 --> 33:07.670
And I want you to understand
what he is capable of.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.870
What do you think?

33:14.070 --> 33:17.630
I think this was a house
fucking full of secrets and lies.

33:19.230 --> 33:21.550
And I think it might be worth
speaking to the kids

33:21.750 --> 33:24.110
to see what their experience
of this marriage was.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.950
Maybe check
his professional history.

33:29.030 --> 33:31.430
And then I think I want to sleep
for a year.

33:36.790 --> 33:39.110
I have never lied to you, Amy.

33:39.310 --> 33:42.230
I always told you there would be
other women that I....

33:42.430 --> 33:44.790
Oh, come on, don't get coy now,
other women that you fucked.

33:44.870 --> 33:46.150
But only one I loved.

33:47.390 --> 33:49.790
And liking a shag in the woods
doesn't make me a murderer.

33:49.990 --> 33:52.270
DOORBELL RINGS
Jesus!

33:53.510 --> 33:55.070
These journalists...!

33:59.830 --> 34:01.510
Pete!
She's kicked me out, Jamie.

34:01.670 --> 34:02.950
Can I kip at yours for a bit?

34:05.990 --> 34:07.710
I'm sorry you feel let down, mate,

34:07.910 --> 34:10.070
but I have issues of my own
at the moment

34:10.110 --> 34:12.110
and I need to spend some time alone
with Amy.

34:12.270 --> 34:13.670
Mate, I've nowhere to stay tonight.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.510
Then find a hotel,
like a normal person.

34:15.710 --> 34:18.590
With what?
I gave you three grand two days ago.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.350
Nice.

34:20.510 --> 34:21.989
Just throw that back in my face.

34:22.190 --> 34:23.790
I'm not throwing it back
in your face.

34:23.989 --> 34:25.790
I'm just reminding you
that I have helped you

34:25.949 --> 34:27.630
innumerable times over the years,

34:27.830 --> 34:29.989
and the one time I say no,
you get arsy.

34:30.030 --> 34:31.230
Grow up.

34:31.389 --> 34:32.550
Fine.

34:35.909 --> 34:38.510
You might just want to consider
something, though.

34:40.670 --> 34:42.070
I know stuff, Jamie,

34:42.230 --> 34:44.670
about your boy that night.

34:44.830 --> 34:46.469
Stuff I've never mentioned before.

34:46.670 --> 34:49.670
You might just want
to bear that in mind.

34:52.630 --> 34:54.750
Get the fuck out of my house.

35:16.990 --> 35:17.990
Oh...

35:37.440 --> 35:40.640
Well, call data records show
that James Hollis rang Tim Finch

35:40.720 --> 35:42.910
about an hour after
we interviewed him. Oh, OK.

35:42.980 --> 35:45.920
And he also spoke to Pete Carr,
but not to Chris Lowe.

35:46.030 --> 35:48.830
Interesting.
Did any of the others ring Lowe?

35:48.930 --> 35:51.580
No, but Lowe rang Finch
just after I called him yesterday.

35:51.640 --> 35:54.690
But the call length suggested
it went straight to voice mail.

35:54.860 --> 35:58.880
So the most vulnerable of the four
is left the most isolated.

35:58.900 --> 36:00.430
Which might be coincidence.

36:00.450 --> 36:02.300
Yeah, or it might not be.
Yeah.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.450
Dr Finch, it turns out,
has just been involved

36:04.510 --> 36:06.680
in a professional misconduct case.

36:06.710 --> 36:08.950
I mean, I should point out
he was completely exonerated.

36:08.970 --> 36:10.560
But the allegation was,

36:10.840 --> 36:13.240
"He was verbally abusive
to an elderly patient,

36:13.440 --> 36:16.280
"including an alleged threat
to overdose her on morphine."

36:16.440 --> 36:17.680
Wow.

36:20.510 --> 36:21.990
Violent to her?

36:22.320 --> 36:23.610
Jesus, God, no!

36:23.670 --> 36:26.190
No, we never saw any evidence
of that.

36:26.440 --> 36:30.000
I mean, Em was 11,
I was 9 when they separated.

36:30.020 --> 36:32.440
So we weren't babies.
If there'd been anything like that,

36:32.460 --> 36:34.280
we'd have had some sense of it.
I know we would.

36:34.350 --> 36:35.690
But we just didn't, did we?

36:35.720 --> 36:38.550
Although you, erm, said earlier...

36:39.360 --> 36:43.730
..you were both at boarding school
from 7 till 18.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.520
Yeah, but we were home holidays,
lots of weekends.

36:46.550 --> 36:48.960
We saw a lot of our parents.
We know who our father is.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.160
That's not a violent man.
Not to our mother. Not to anyone.

36:52.780 --> 36:53.820
So...

36:55.020 --> 36:56.550
..you think these are fake?

36:58.290 --> 37:00.930
Fake or make-up or whatever.

37:00.980 --> 37:02.140
I don't...

37:02.220 --> 37:04.240
I don't really know or care.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.440
What I do know,
and I very much doubt she told you,

37:06.530 --> 37:09.340
is that she tried to get Dad
to give her 50,000 quid for them.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.060
Right.

37:12.310 --> 37:14.280
Sorry, when was this?
Yesterday.

37:14.940 --> 37:17.320
I mean, he refused, of course.
Right.

37:17.370 --> 37:19.800
Look, our father is not a saint.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.560
He can be controlling

37:21.760 --> 37:23.910
and he certainly likes
to get his own way,

37:23.970 --> 37:27.040
but everything you're implying to
do with the Hayley Reid case is...

37:27.340 --> 37:28.860
It's just not possible.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.040
SHE SIGHS

37:32.520 --> 37:33.800
Thank you.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.640
50 grand...!

37:38.800 --> 37:39.800
Yeah.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.800
Odd the other sister
hardly said a word.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.960
Yeah, I clocked that.

37:45.160 --> 37:47.920
Bottom line, I suspect Derran Finch
is a bit bonkers, but...

37:49.480 --> 37:51.880
..bonkers people
tell the truth as well.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.320
Sunny, what time's Lowe here?

38:08.640 --> 38:09.920
He should be here now.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.160
Oh, no...

38:16.840 --> 38:17.920
Shit!

38:19.080 --> 38:20.160
Shit! Shit!

38:20.320 --> 38:21.680
What?

38:21.880 --> 38:23.880
Obviously,
I went straight back to the cafe,

38:24.040 --> 38:25.480
but they'd had nothing handed in.

38:25.640 --> 38:26.960
I'm so sorry, sir.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.520
So, whose file?
Pete Carr's.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.240
Any sensitive stuff inside?

38:33.560 --> 38:35.040
Lots.

38:37.360 --> 38:38.720
HE DIALS A NUMBER

39:11.560 --> 39:14.720
I feel like I'm slightly losing
the plot. Don't be daft.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.880
My dad, these files...

39:17.040 --> 39:19.160
They'll turn up. It'll be fine.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.400
You're just tired.
It just makes everything seem worse.

39:23.840 --> 39:26.000
Come on, then, let's do Chris Lowe.
Ah...

39:26.960 --> 39:28.360
He didn't turn up.

39:28.520 --> 39:29.680
Right.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.280
Did he call?
No.

39:31.480 --> 39:34.000
Nothing.
I left a message on his mobile,

39:34.160 --> 39:35.640
left it at his work, nothing.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.160
Boss? Have you got two minutes?
Sure, yeah. What's up?

39:38.360 --> 39:41.010
Er, I was doing a bit of a dig on
Hollis, following the e-mails. Yep.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.000
I've found something
I think we've all missed.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.240
OK.

39:46.440 --> 39:49.720
So the way the fathers
all spoke about the kids,

39:49.880 --> 39:51.440
kind of days out and bedtimes,

39:51.640 --> 39:54.000
I think we just assumed
they were all little ones.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.960
And three of the four were.

39:56.160 --> 39:59.400
Emma Finch was ten, her sister
was eight and Maya Lowe was six.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.040
But Eliot Hollis, it turns out
he was about to turn 16.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.040
And 16 with some issues.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.880
Two arrests already for possession.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.720
One for drunk and disorderly.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.520
And this is a real stinger...

40:10.680 --> 40:13.960
Erm, one for stealing his dad's car

40:14.120 --> 40:16.240
a month before the Millennium.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.880
Call the father back in now.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.120
PHONE ACTIVATES

40:30.280 --> 40:32.720
PHONE RINGS

40:42.040 --> 40:43.640
Hey, Mark.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.120
Where are you?

40:45.280 --> 40:46.960
Yeah, erm... on my way in.

40:47.120 --> 40:49.000
Sorry, I was chasing down a...

40:49.200 --> 40:51.600
I've had all your stuff boxed up.
I'll leave it at reception.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.280
Sorry?

40:54.480 --> 40:57.440
You stole from the disabled, never
mind the Hayley Reid connections.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.320
I don't want you
anywhere near my business.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.760
Mark, listen to me.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.520
No matter what Maria's told you...

41:02.680 --> 41:04.080
Maria hasn't told me anything.

41:04.240 --> 41:05.640
Have you not been online?

41:05.800 --> 41:07.480
Online?

41:07.640 --> 41:08.960
No, why?

41:10.120 --> 41:11.320
Google your name.

41:11.480 --> 41:13.040
MARK HANGS UP

41:28.080 --> 41:31.160
Jesus, there's one site here
that's found a photo of him.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.040
OK, I need to make a statement.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.920
And we need
to shut these websites down fast.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.600
The press
are going to slaughter us.

41:40.800 --> 41:43.480
If you need to take me off the case,
I'll understand completely.

41:43.680 --> 41:48.600
For the record, I very much want
to stay and make good my mistake.

41:49.960 --> 41:51.840
I need to find Pete Carr.

41:56.760 --> 41:59.760
I didn't do it, Tim.
I want you to know that.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.640
Pete, you really don't need
to convince me.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.280
I've made mistakes.

42:03.480 --> 42:05.640
I've done some pretty shabby things,
I'll accept that.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.520
But I'd never hurt anyone.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.880
I never even saw Hayley Reid
that night.

42:10.040 --> 42:11.480
Yeah, I believe you.

42:11.640 --> 42:13.320
Well, the police clearly don't.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.160
And I'm not sure they believe a word
I say now.

42:16.360 --> 42:19.480
So I want to tell you something
and I want you to tell the police.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.600
OK, but I'm not sure they want to
speak to me again. But if they do...

42:24.760 --> 42:27.480
It's about Jamie's boy Eliot.

42:27.640 --> 42:29.880
About something I saw that night.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.600
Have you tried the arts centre?

43:02.800 --> 43:05.120
Yeah, but they said
that he wouldn't be in today.

43:05.320 --> 43:07.680
Right, well, that's where he told me
he was going. OK.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.320
Well, I'll try his mobile again.

43:09.480 --> 43:10.760
Is he in trouble?

43:10.960 --> 43:12.600
I can't tell you any more,
I'm afraid.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.760
He's a very vulnerable man, DI Khan.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.760
Tell me if I should be worried.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.160
You have a son, I think.

43:23.280 --> 43:24.600
Er, yes.

43:24.760 --> 43:25.840
Asif.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.800
Jamila, is there anywhere
that you and Asif can go and stay

43:29.000 --> 43:31.880
for the next few days
that Christopher doesn't know about?

43:36.800 --> 43:38.640
PRESS CAMERAS CLICK

43:38.840 --> 43:41.000
On behalf
of the Metropolitan Police,

43:41.040 --> 43:44.600
I wish to apologise to Mr Carr
and his family

43:44.760 --> 43:47.680
and indeed to Hayley Reid's family

43:47.880 --> 43:52.080
for any distress
that has been caused by my mistake.

43:53.760 --> 43:57.160
I wish to reiterate
that no arrests have been made.

43:58.280 --> 44:00.720
No-one has been charged
with anything.

44:00.920 --> 44:03.360
And that Mr Carr
is just one of many people

44:03.560 --> 44:05.760
who are helping us
with our enquiries.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.880
I would like to remind people

44:08.080 --> 44:11.600
that publication of these documents
online is illegal...

44:13.040 --> 44:15.800
..and we will take action
against anyone who does so.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.640
I would also remind
members of the public

44:19.670 --> 44:23.470
that we will be seeking prosecution
for any online activity

44:23.590 --> 44:26.710
that seeks to incite violence
against Mr Carr.

44:28.380 --> 44:32.580
And lastly, I would urge
whoever found this document

44:32.660 --> 44:34.670
to take it
to their nearest police station

44:34.800 --> 44:36.720
and hand it in as soon as possible.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.600
Thank you.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.200
Peter Carr?

44:40.360 --> 44:41.480
Urgh!
