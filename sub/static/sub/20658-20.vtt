00:07.033 --> 00:08.033
(school bell ringing)

00:08.033 --> 00:09.567
(girl)
Come on, kid, it's just

00:09.567 --> 00:12.767
a little reefer roach
cigarette.

00:12.767 --> 00:14.900
Okay, drug dealer.

00:14.900 --> 00:17.900
One smoke of
the marijuana, please.

00:19.267 --> 00:23.200
Oh, no, I am addicted
to heroin now.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.600
Marijuana is
a gateway drug

00:24.600 --> 00:26.533
and that's
the blunt truth.

00:26.533 --> 00:30.100
Dope isn't dope,
it's for dopes.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.100
I'm sorry, Miss Axford,
this is stupid.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.400
Yeah, uh, I'm not
gonna do this

00:33.400 --> 00:34.700
in front of
the whole school.

00:34.700 --> 00:36.767
Well, Scooper, then maybe
you shouldn't have graffitied

00:36.767 --> 00:38.833
"Reading sucks!"
all over the science lab.

00:38.833 --> 00:41.100
Prove to me it doesn't suck.
You can't!

00:41.100 --> 00:43.600
All right, guys,
assembly's in an hour.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.000
It's either this
or summer school.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.400
You choose.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.100
Plus, according to
my drug education worksheets,

00:50.100 --> 00:52.433
all of this
is completely true.

00:52.433 --> 00:54.367
(Adam clapping)

00:56.767 --> 01:00.400
Yes, the soul of
the theater is truth.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.933
But what was said
here today

01:01.933 --> 01:04.700
is as true as
the night is bright.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.433
Ha!
That is to say,

01:06.433 --> 01:10.167
nay, to declare,
it was false.

01:10.167 --> 01:11.533
Hi, Emily!
Like my hat?

01:11.533 --> 01:14.167
Come on, dude, I told you,
not while I'm at work.

01:14.167 --> 01:15.767
I'm sorry,
I couldn't help myself.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.233
What we teach kids
about drugs

01:17.233 --> 01:19.833
in this country
is completely wrong.

01:19.833 --> 01:23.400
'Tis I, Webby award
nominee Adam Conover,

01:23.400 --> 01:26.600
and I present to thee,
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:26.600 --> 01:28.833
(whistling)

01:35.933 --> 01:37.533
Listen, Drew Carey,
all you adults

01:37.533 --> 01:39.067
always tell us
the same thing--

01:39.067 --> 01:41.267
Weed's gonna kill us,
it's a gateway drug.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.600
Lying isn't funny.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.933
Oh, no, for most people,
weed is essentially harmless.

01:45.933 --> 01:48.933
Whoa-kay,
no way, Jose.

01:48.933 --> 01:50.433
Look, I know this stuff

01:50.433 --> 01:53.500
is a little
overboard, but...

01:53.500 --> 01:55.233
you can't tell kids
weed isn't bad!

01:55.233 --> 01:57.000
Of course I can.
It's true.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.033
And we've known it
for decades.

01:59.033 --> 02:00.767
Counting deaths from
the substance alone,

02:00.767 --> 02:03.533
alcohol kills
88,000 people a year.

02:03.533 --> 02:06.767
Tobacco kills 480,000.

02:06.767 --> 02:09.233
And marijuana kills
absolutely no one.

02:09.233 --> 02:10.333
(buzzer)

02:10.333 --> 02:12.433
Uh, according to curriculum,

02:12.433 --> 02:15.267
marijuana can get you hooked
on harder substances.

02:15.267 --> 02:16.600
It's a gateway drug.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.900
Yeah, educators have been
saying that for years,

02:18.900 --> 02:20.367
but it's not true.

02:20.367 --> 02:21.867
Most people
who try marijuana

02:21.867 --> 02:24.400
don't even continue
smoking marijuana.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.767
This dude knows
what's up.

02:25.767 --> 02:28.600
Now, that doesn't mean
that it's perfectly safe.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.667
Dude, I thought
you were cool.

02:29.667 --> 02:32.000
Oh, I wish!
If you're under 25,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
smoking weed can lead
to memory problems

02:34.000 --> 02:35.400
and poor
cognitive functioning.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.433
But if you're an adult,

02:36.433 --> 02:37.767
and your brain
has finished developing,

02:37.767 --> 02:39.900
it's really your choice.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.433
Adam, wrong way.
Also, not in a school.

02:42.433 --> 02:44.433
Sorry, I usually
only smoke at parties,

02:44.433 --> 02:45.833
and I'm rarely
invited to them.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.100
Yeah, wonder why.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.733
The truth is,
if you know the risks

02:48.733 --> 02:51.600
and you use it in moderation,
weed is no big deal.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.833
And, in fact, humans have been
using it for millennia.

02:54.833 --> 02:56.833
Humans started growing cannabis
as a crop

02:56.833 --> 02:59.433
over 8,000 years ago.

02:59.433 --> 03:02.433
This crop will feed our family
for a year,

03:02.433 --> 03:05.333
and this crop
will make movies way funnier.

03:05.333 --> 03:08.067
(Adam)
In 440 BCE,
Herodotus wrote about

03:08.067 --> 03:10.900
the ancient tradition
of cannabis steam baths.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.267
Fellow citizens,
as a wise man

03:13.267 --> 03:17.433
once told me, VapeLife!
(laughing)

03:17.433 --> 03:19.000
And in America,
for many years

03:19.000 --> 03:20.167
marijuana was available

03:20.167 --> 03:22.267
in over-the-counter
medications.

03:22.267 --> 03:23.733
Step right up and try

03:23.733 --> 03:26.933
Professor Horkorium's
Rejuvenating Tincture!

03:26.933 --> 03:29.733
Now with the Arab hashish.

03:29.733 --> 03:31.167
For most
of America's history,

03:31.167 --> 03:33.433
weed was legal.
No one cared about it.

03:33.433 --> 03:34.867
All right,
so what changed?

03:34.867 --> 03:36.867
I mean, there must be
some reason we banned it.

03:36.867 --> 03:39.433
Oh, there is.
And it's real weird.

03:39.433 --> 03:41.167
Enter Harry Anslinger,
commissioner of

03:41.167 --> 03:42.433
the Federal Bureau
of Narcotics

03:42.433 --> 03:44.167
and a staunch
prohibitionist.

03:44.167 --> 03:46.533
Our funding has been cut!
They'll shut me down

03:46.533 --> 03:49.500
if I don't find
a new chemical to demonize.

03:49.500 --> 03:54.167
Let's see, what are people
scared of for no good reason?

03:54.167 --> 03:56.333
A-ha!
Mexicans!

03:56.333 --> 04:00.100
And Mexicans
smoke marijuana!

04:00.100 --> 04:03.600
That's it!
Hey, racist mob...

04:03.600 --> 04:05.067
(all)
Hmm?

04:05.067 --> 04:08.433
Marijuana makes Mexicans
thirst for white blood.

04:08.433 --> 04:09.667
Spread the word!

04:09.667 --> 04:11.833
(mob shouting)

04:11.833 --> 04:13.933
Anslinger used
that racism to fuel

04:13.933 --> 04:16.600
a propaganda campaign
against the drug,

04:16.600 --> 04:17.933
testifying before
Congress...

04:17.933 --> 04:20.600
Marijuana is
an addictive drug

04:20.600 --> 04:22.933
which produces
in its users

04:22.933 --> 04:26.667
insanity, criminality,
and death!

04:26.667 --> 04:29.367
(Adam)
Soon, the "Marijuana
causes violence" meme

04:29.367 --> 04:32.100
was everywhere, from
newspapers to movies...

04:32.100 --> 04:35.600
Just a young boy.
Under the influence of the drug,

04:35.600 --> 04:37.833
he killed his entire family
with an axe.

04:37.833 --> 04:39.933
...to subtle
political cartoons.

04:39.933 --> 04:42.167
(man)
Nazi propaganda.

04:42.167 --> 04:43.367
What does that
even mean?

04:43.367 --> 04:46.200
Why would he just say
the words, "Nazi propaganda"?

04:46.200 --> 04:49.033
Honestly, no idea.
But, it worked.

04:49.033 --> 04:51.933
In 1937, Congress
banned marijuana

04:51.933 --> 04:53.500
and later,
with Anslinger's help,

04:53.500 --> 04:54.667
they passed
the first

04:54.667 --> 04:56.733
mandatory minimum
sentencing laws

04:56.733 --> 04:58.233
which made it so that
your first time

04:58.233 --> 04:59.733
getting caught
with this

04:59.733 --> 05:02.867
could put you away
from two to ten years.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.333
Mm, thank you,
that's what I thought.

05:05.333 --> 05:06.833
(Adam)
And the true irony is,

05:06.833 --> 05:09.500
the government knew
Anslinger's claims were false.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.333
Scientists proved marijuana
wasn't connected to violence

05:12.333 --> 05:14.367
or insanity in the '40s.

05:14.367 --> 05:17.267
And in 1973,
a bipartisan commission

05:17.267 --> 05:19.367
recommended Nixon
decriminalize it.

05:19.367 --> 05:21.900
But, Nixon being
Nixon...

05:21.900 --> 05:24.733
Mr. President,
literally everyone agrees,

05:24.733 --> 05:26.667
marijuana is safe.

05:26.667 --> 05:31.067
Out! Get out!
I have zero chill!

05:31.067 --> 05:34.200
The war on drugs
begins now!

05:34.200 --> 05:36.100
I don't understand.
If he knew it was safe,

05:36.100 --> 05:37.567
why would he be so tough
on it?

05:37.567 --> 05:38.667
Well,
why don't you ask

05:38.667 --> 05:40.367
Nixon's aide,
John Ehrlichman.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.033
He said, in 1994...

05:42.033 --> 05:43.600
We knew we couldn't
make it illegal

05:43.600 --> 05:46.267
to be either
against the war or black,

05:46.267 --> 05:48.333
but by getting the public
to associate the hippies

05:48.333 --> 05:50.333
with marijuana
and blacks with heroin...

06:01.033 --> 06:03.333
Did we know we were lying
about the drugs?

06:07.267 --> 06:09.600
That's a real quote?
Yeah.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.867
That's a real quote.

06:10.867 --> 06:12.567
Nixon started
the war on drugs

06:12.567 --> 06:15.267
to bully his political
enemies and minorities.

06:15.267 --> 06:17.267
His own aide
admitted it.

06:17.267 --> 06:20.567
I can't believe I've been
teaching this to children.

06:20.567 --> 06:22.833
At least
it's better now, right?

06:22.833 --> 06:24.267
You wish.

06:24.267 --> 06:26.600
Despite laws being
loosened in a few states,

06:26.600 --> 06:28.367
mandatory minimums
are still in effect

06:28.367 --> 06:31.267
all across the country,
and marijuana still accounts

06:31.267 --> 06:33.867
for nearly half
of all drug arrests.

06:33.867 --> 06:35.667
And, despite the fact
that white and black people

06:35.667 --> 06:37.333
smoke at basically
the same rate,

06:37.333 --> 06:39.600
black people
are four times as likely

06:39.600 --> 06:42.100
to be arrested
for marijuana.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.567
Look, we know for a fact
that weed isn't dangerous,

06:45.567 --> 06:48.233
but we're still following
racist old laws

06:48.233 --> 06:49.600
and throwing countless
people of color

06:49.600 --> 06:52.333
in prison for no reason.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.600
(car approaching,
distant music)

07:05.933 --> 07:08.167
Well, we actually
have fact checkers, but--

07:08.167 --> 07:11.267
Shut it, barf-boy!
Before you barf everywhere.

07:11.267 --> 07:13.933
Drugs aren't cool.
D.A.R.E. says so.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.200
Oh, the D.A.R.E.
program!

07:15.200 --> 07:16.433
That was
a massive failure

07:16.433 --> 07:18.267
that may have actually
increased drug use.

Ooh!

Okay, kids...

07:29.333 --> 07:32.400

what every drug looks like?

07:32.400 --> 07:34.400
Ah, watch out
for this one.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.733
Weed. It might be laced
with black tar heroin.

07:37.733 --> 07:42.067
And this is LSD.
Don't do it!

07:42.067 --> 07:46.033
Makes you see things, like...
dragons.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.767

Mmm.

Oh, hello!

Everybody, come say hi

07:59.167 --> 08:02.000
Daren, what do you want
to teach the kids today?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.033
The D.A.R.E. program was
a massive failure

08:04.033 --> 08:05.933
with horrific
consequences.

08:05.933 --> 08:08.367
Aah!
Not you!

08:08.367 --> 08:11.100
You are a disgrace
to that sacred suit.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.400
Look, you mean well,
but the "Just say no"

08:13.400 --> 08:14.900
propaganda
you're peddling

08:14.900 --> 08:16.667
can actually increase
drug use.

08:16.667 --> 08:19.700
Adam, tread lightly.
He's a cop.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.900
Oh, I'll be fine.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.033
Authority figures
love being challenged.

08:22.033 --> 08:24.000
Oh, you can't
challenge me

08:24.000 --> 08:25.867
because I know
the truth.

08:25.867 --> 08:30.367
If you do any drug,
even once,

08:30.367 --> 08:31.500
you're gonna become
an addict.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.233
And let me
tell you something.

08:33.233 --> 08:36.500
You're gonna die!
That's ridiculous.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.367
This zero-tolerance,
abstinence-only approach

08:39.367 --> 08:42.400
took off in the 1980s
when Nancy Reagan said

08:42.400 --> 08:44.067
those three
little words...

08:44.067 --> 08:45.267
Just say no.

08:45.267 --> 08:46.533
(Adam)
Soon, anti-drug messages

08:46.533 --> 08:47.767
were showing up
in commercials...

08:47.767 --> 08:50.233
♪♪

08:50.233 --> 08:53.400
...before arcade games,

08:53.400 --> 08:55.267

In public schools,
the bright happy face

09:00.033 --> 09:01.367
of zero tolerance

09:01.367 --> 09:05.200
was Drug Abuse Resistance
Education, or D.A.R.E.

What's the big deal?

09:06.233 --> 09:07.500
I remember
my D.A.R.E. program.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.033
It was fun.
We did little skits.

09:10.033 --> 09:12.733
Hey, Miss "A,"
what are some cool ways

09:12.733 --> 09:15.200

to a drug dealer?

09:15.200 --> 09:17.700
No.
Heck, no!

09:17.700 --> 09:19.700
Sorry, I have sports
to get to.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.867
I'm not a chicken,
you're a turkey.

09:21.867 --> 09:24.867
And did any of those
stop you from trying drugs?

09:24.867 --> 09:26.733
(unconvincingly)
Yeah.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.667
Study after study
found that

09:28.667 --> 09:31.700
D.A.R.E. had no effect
on drug use at all.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.367
In fact, one major study
found that, for some kids,

09:34.367 --> 09:37.000
it actually
increased drug use.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.100
Okay, why would
that be?

09:38.100 --> 09:39.533
I don't know, maybe
because showing kids

09:39.533 --> 09:40.600
a briefcase
full of drugs

09:40.600 --> 09:41.700
is a great way
to cultivate

09:41.700 --> 09:43.900
a hobbyist interest
in drug varieties?

09:43.900 --> 09:44.933
So, what's
the difference

09:44.933 --> 09:47.200
between Sour Diesel
and OG Kush?

09:47.200 --> 09:48.267
Well, both will kill ya.

09:48.267 --> 09:51.400
But Kush is more
of a warm hug feeling.

09:51.400 --> 09:54.033
At its peak, D.A.R.E.
cost U.S. taxpayers

09:54.033 --> 09:56.533
up to $1.3 billion

09:56.533 --> 09:58.867
even though it
straight up did not work.

09:58.867 --> 10:00.667
Well, maybe
they just didn't know.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.533
Oh, we totally did.
Back in 1994,

10:03.533 --> 10:04.700
a government-funded study

10:04.700 --> 10:06.700
found that D.A.R.E.
did absolutely nothing.

10:06.700 --> 10:07.833
Shut up!

10:07.833 --> 10:08.867
But then D.A.R.E.
pressured us

10:08.867 --> 10:10.200
into disavowing
our own study.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.233
(taser clicking)

10:11.233 --> 10:14.533
Oh, uh, uh,
D.A.R.E. is good and cool.

10:14.533 --> 10:15.833
But, the evidence
is clear.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.267
The zero tolerance approach
does not work.

10:18.267 --> 10:20.833
Watch your mouth before
I make it barf!

10:20.833 --> 10:22.533
Zero tolerance
is the foundation

10:22.533 --> 10:23.600
for the war on drugs,

10:23.600 --> 10:25.033
and we are winning
that war.

10:25.033 --> 10:26.867
Sorry, you're wrong.

10:26.867 --> 10:29.233
The war on drugs has been
a massive failure.

10:29.233 --> 10:30.567
And the harsh
enforcement tactics

10:30.567 --> 10:32.033
we've been using since
the '80s

10:32.033 --> 10:34.333
have only made
the drug problem worse.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.067
We have spent millions
upon millions

10:36.067 --> 10:37.867
raiding outdoor
marijuana farms...

10:37.867 --> 10:40.100
Come out and greet
the sun, little guys.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.500
...but that's just
made growers switch

10:41.500 --> 10:43.200
to hydroponic
grow rooms

10:43.200 --> 10:45.900
which helped create
a much stronger product.

10:45.900 --> 10:48.067
Thanks, war on drugs.

10:48.067 --> 10:50.267
But now, drugs are
harder to get.

10:50.267 --> 10:51.600
Ha!
No, again.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.867
Since the drug war
started,

10:52.867 --> 10:55.867
the prices of cannabis,
cocaine, and even heroin

10:55.867 --> 10:57.333
have all plummeted.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.700
Sale on smack,
y'all!

10:58.700 --> 11:01.200
80% off!
Drug war discount!

11:01.200 --> 11:05.067
Ooh, "bogo" sale!
I'm a "smack-sanista."

11:05.067 --> 11:06.867
Thanks, war on drugs.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.500
But, we put
the bad guys in jail.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.433
Again, no.

11:10.433 --> 11:12.867
We've locked up tons
of non-violent drug offenders,

11:12.867 --> 11:16.533
but the vicious kingpins at
the top are still making bank.

11:16.533 --> 11:18.367
The U.S. illicit drug market
is worth

11:18.367 --> 11:21.533
an estimated
$109 billion a year.

11:21.533 --> 11:23.033
And the Sinaloa drug cartel

11:23.033 --> 11:26.367
has as many as
150,000 employees.

11:26.367 --> 11:28.167
That's more than Apple.

11:28.167 --> 11:32.033
We are so proud of
our record sales this year.

11:32.033 --> 11:33.933
And one more thing...

11:33.933 --> 11:35.200
more cocaine!

11:35.200 --> 11:37.200
(cheers and applause)

11:37.200 --> 11:39.167
Okay, okay, okay.
How do you expect

11:39.167 --> 11:40.333
these kids
to believe you?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.100
You're probably
some pothead loser.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.267
Well, I'm not.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.567
Sir!

11:44.567 --> 11:45.867
As you were,
Officer.

11:45.867 --> 11:48.000
Emily, Bruce, this is
Sheriff John Urquhart

11:48.000 --> 11:49.500
of King County,
Washington.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.700
Very nice
to meet you.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.067
You know,
before I was sheriff,

11:52.067 --> 11:53.933
I was a narcotics
detective, and I fought

11:53.933 --> 11:56.000
the war on drugs
at the ground level.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.500
Now, I've been in
law enforcement for 40 years,

11:58.500 --> 12:00.267
and it's become
very obvious to me

12:00.267 --> 12:01.900
that the war on drugs
hasn't worked.

12:01.900 --> 12:03.333
Now, ever the last
few decades,

12:03.333 --> 12:06.400
we've spent
over $1 trillion

12:06.400 --> 12:08.333
fighting the war on drugs,
and this is

12:08.333 --> 12:10.333
how much drug use
has dropped in America.

12:11.533 --> 12:14.000
No decline at all.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.500
Drug addiction
is a health issue.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.900
but we've spent
so much time

12:16.900 --> 12:19.400
locking people up
that we've ignored that.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.267
We don't lock up people
who need insulin shots.

12:22.267 --> 12:24.733
Why should we lock up people
for this disease?

12:24.733 --> 12:27.367
And the war on drugs
has been an abject failure.

12:29.033 --> 12:32.267
No.
No! No!

12:32.267 --> 12:35.000
This is all I have
to show for my life?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.567
The war on drugs failed.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.567
(retching)

12:40.767 --> 12:44.533
I guess I was the...
barf-boy all along.

12:44.533 --> 12:46.233
Dude, this is sad.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.700
(sobbing)
That's okay, Bruce.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.567
I'll give you
a ride home.

12:50.567 --> 12:52.033
(car doors opening, closing)

12:52.033 --> 12:54.733
(car engine starting)

12:56.033 --> 12:57.933
This sucks.

12:57.933 --> 13:00.833
Is there no way to stop kids
from using illegal drugs?

13:00.833 --> 13:02.567
That's so scary.

13:02.567 --> 13:04.000
But you know
what's even scarier?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.367
The legal drugs.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.000
Those are actually
much worse!

13:07.000 --> 13:08.267
(chuckling)

13:08.267 --> 13:10.167
You are such a...

13:11.567 --> 13:13.600
Not at school, Emily.
Nope.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.033
Save it
for the drive home.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.433
♪♪

13:21.267 --> 13:23.233
Miss Axford,
are you getting a divorce?

13:23.233 --> 13:24.533
Whenever an adult is sad,

13:24.533 --> 13:26.267
I assume they're getting
a divorce.

13:26.267 --> 13:28.267
Yeah, I can do a kick-flip,
cheer you up,

13:28.267 --> 13:30.033
or like a sick grind?

13:30.033 --> 13:32.200
It's okay, I'm fine,
I just get this way

13:32.200 --> 13:35.000
whenever Adam shows up.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.567
Wait, hold on.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.833
There's no way that legal drugs
could be bad, right?

13:38.833 --> 13:41.033
I mean, they're prescribed
by doctors.

13:41.033 --> 13:42.900
Hate to break it to you,
but some prescription drugs

13:42.900 --> 13:44.900
are almost identical
to street drugs.

13:44.900 --> 13:48.867
Kids across America take
the prescription drug Adderall,

13:48.867 --> 13:50.167
which is an amphetamine.

13:50.167 --> 13:51.900
But you know what else
is an amphetamine?

13:51.900 --> 13:52.933
Meth.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.533
I'm gonna need
to confiscate that.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.767
Oh, boy, I've got
a lot of drugs.

13:56.767 --> 13:58.200
The chemical composition
of the two drugs

13:58.200 --> 14:00.600
is nearly identical,
and in one study,

14:00.600 --> 14:03.533
people who took both couldn't
even tell the difference.

14:03.533 --> 14:05.700
So, I should stop
taking Adderall?

14:05.700 --> 14:08.367
No, Adderall still helps
a lot of people.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.033
But the fact remains,
we're giving kids

14:10.033 --> 14:13.767
essentially the same drug
we make scary TV shows about.

14:13.767 --> 14:16.533
I am the one
who concentrates.

14:16.533 --> 14:19.433
And the line gets blurrier.
Uh...

14:19.433 --> 14:21.367
But there are no
prescription drugs

14:21.367 --> 14:23.367
as bad as, like, heroin.

14:23.367 --> 14:26.033
Actually, heroin was first
marketed and sold

14:26.033 --> 14:27.700
by the drug company Bayer.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.033
You know,
the aspirin people.

14:30.033 --> 14:31.033
(coughing)

14:31.033 --> 14:33.067
Mm, cough, eh?

14:33.067 --> 14:36.900
Well, take two heroin
and call me in the morning.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.567
Wait, so anyone could
just go into a store

14:38.567 --> 14:40.000
and buy heroin?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.200
Yep, they even gave it
to kids.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.200
(coughing)

14:43.200 --> 14:44.700
You little rascal.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.333
Now, back to the coal mines
with ya!

14:47.533 --> 14:50.267
Heroin was considered so safe,
one medical journal

14:50.267 --> 14:51.933
even claimed that
there was no danger

14:51.933 --> 14:55.100
of acquiring a habit.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.667
Well, now, we know better.

14:56.667 --> 14:59.333
I mean, doctors don't prescribe
drugs like that anymore.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.033
Yeah, they do.
All the time.

15:02.033 --> 15:04.500
Heroin is an opioid,
so when it was banned,

15:04.500 --> 15:06.367
scientists just invented
new opioids

15:06.367 --> 15:09.700
that act on the exact
same receptors in the brain.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.400
Heroin's illegal.

15:11.400 --> 15:17.167
Well, this isn't heroin,
it's... OxyContin.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.700
Let's advertise
the (bleep) out of it.

15:19.700 --> 15:20.900
And so, they did.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.500
In the '90s,
drugmaker Purdue

15:22.500 --> 15:24.867
started marketing
OxyContin like crazy,

15:24.867 --> 15:28.400
producing weird swag
like plush toys,

15:28.400 --> 15:32.533
golf balls,
and even a swing CD.

15:32.533 --> 15:35.700
And OxyContin's
popularity soared.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.400
My elbow really hurts, Doc.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.867
Yeah, well, take two Oxy
and call me in the morning.

15:40.867 --> 15:42.667
This led to a surge
in painkiller abuse

15:42.667 --> 15:43.867
and overdoses.

15:43.867 --> 15:45.533
It's just that
it really hurts,

15:45.533 --> 15:47.033
and it's probably gonna
hurt for a long time.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.900
So, if you could just
scribble, scribble, scribble!

15:48.900 --> 15:50.233
(laughing)

15:50.233 --> 15:52.067
This was great for Purdue.

15:52.067 --> 15:56.867
By 2016, OxyContin alone
had made us 31 billion dollars.

15:56.867 --> 15:58.867
I am very glad we made
that swing CD.

15:58.867 --> 16:00.033
(scatting)

16:00.033 --> 16:01.700
Purdue even issued
an internal memo

16:01.700 --> 16:04.067
encouraging sales people
to push higher doses

16:04.067 --> 16:06.500
in exchange for bonuses,

16:06.500 --> 16:09.533
and this disgusting greed
caused a lot of harm.

16:09.533 --> 16:12.033
In 2014 alone,
prescription opioids

16:12.033 --> 16:15.000
caused almost 19,000
overdose deaths,

16:15.000 --> 16:16.400
double the number from heroin.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.400
(glass breaking)
Oh!

16:17.400 --> 16:18.600
Holy cow.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.767
Well, thank goodness
it's such a pain

16:20.767 --> 16:22.200
to get prescription drugs now.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.000
I mean, the pharmacist
always gives me a guilt trip.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.867
Yep, realizing there
was a big problem,

16:26.867 --> 16:28.667
lawmakers made
prescription opioids

16:28.667 --> 16:30.100
way harder to get.

16:30.100 --> 16:32.000
Well... good.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.700
No, not good.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.367
Because thanks
to the war on drugs,

16:35.367 --> 16:37.233
there was a ton of heroin
in the streets,

16:37.233 --> 16:39.367
and it was really cheap.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.433
Might I interest you
in some heroin?

16:41.433 --> 16:44.433
Same high, 80% off.

16:44.433 --> 16:46.167
I'm a "smack-sanista."

16:47.400 --> 16:49.533
Since the government
cracked down on painkillers,

16:49.533 --> 16:52.200
heroin deaths
have skyrocketed.

16:52.200 --> 16:56.067
Between 2010 and 2015,
they more than tripled,

16:56.067 --> 16:59.733
and some studies found that
80% of new heroin users

16:59.733 --> 17:02.567
got started
on prescription opioids.

17:02.567 --> 17:04.500
And now,
people are getting hooked

17:04.500 --> 17:06.367
on something even worse--

17:06.367 --> 17:07.767
Fentanyl.

17:07.767 --> 17:10.433
It's a highly addictive
prescription opioid

17:10.433 --> 17:13.200
that's up to 50 times
stronger than heroin,

17:13.200 --> 17:16.333
and it's killing people
like crazy.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.367
Look, for decades,
our government told us

17:19.367 --> 17:21.233
that weed was a gateway drug,

17:21.233 --> 17:24.333
while the real gateway drug
was being legally prescribed

17:24.333 --> 17:26.767
by doctors all across America.

17:26.767 --> 17:28.367
And because we ignored
that fact,

17:28.367 --> 17:30.667
we now have
a prescription drug epidemic

17:30.667 --> 17:33.500
and a heroin epidemic.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.733
So, what am I supposed to do?

17:34.733 --> 17:37.367
How am I supposed to get people
to stop using drugs?

17:37.367 --> 17:40.867
Honestly, I don't think you can.

17:40.867 --> 17:43.367
Throughout human history,
people have made drugs,

17:43.367 --> 17:44.933
other people
have taken those drugs,

17:44.933 --> 17:46.700
and some of them have
gotten addicted.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.367
Doing drugs is just
something humans do.

17:50.367 --> 17:52.867
There's no way
to stop it completely.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.367
In the desk behind you

17:57.367 --> 17:59.167
there's a bottle of Xanax,
would you...

17:59.167 --> 18:00.200
Of course.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.400
(man on PA)
Attention, students.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.033
Please report
to the all-purpose room

18:03.033 --> 18:04.867
for Miss Axford's
anti-drug assembly.

18:04.867 --> 18:07.700
(scoffs)
The assembly, ugh!

18:07.700 --> 18:09.533
What's the point?
All my students

18:09.533 --> 18:12.667
are gonna do drugs and die,
and there's no hope.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.667
Emily, there's always hope.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.700
And there's a lot we can do
to help drug users.

18:16.700 --> 18:20.233
And I'll tell you about it
using the art of the theater!

18:20.233 --> 18:21.367
Is that a leotard?

18:21.367 --> 18:22.933
Yeah, could you zip me up?

18:28.200 --> 18:31.167
I am fear.
I whisper lies,

18:31.167 --> 18:35.167
lies like weed is deadly
and all drug users

18:35.167 --> 18:36.733
should be punished.

18:36.733 --> 18:40.033
I am the law
and I am flawed.

18:40.033 --> 18:42.400
I am... a law flaw.

18:43.833 --> 18:48.400
I am the truth,
and the truth is this.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.100
We will never eradicate
drug use,

18:51.100 --> 18:54.733
but we can reduce
the harm drugs cause.

18:54.733 --> 18:58.500
Get to the point before everyone
pulls out their phones.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.100
Right.
I present to thee

19:01.100 --> 19:03.833
Donald MacPherson,
executive director

19:03.833 --> 19:06.533
of the Canadian
Drug Policy Coalition.

19:06.533 --> 19:07.700
(applause)

19:07.700 --> 19:09.500
Donald, would you tell
Emily and our audience

19:09.500 --> 19:11.667
about Vancouver's approach
to harm reduction?

19:11.667 --> 19:13.167
Okay, Adam.
Well, in Vancouver,

19:13.167 --> 19:15.500
we learned that addiction
is really a health issue.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.033
So, we opened
a health facility

19:17.033 --> 19:18.700
called Insite,
where people can come

19:18.700 --> 19:22.167
and inject their drugs
under medical supervision,

19:22.167 --> 19:25.033
without fear of arrest
or of dying from an overdose.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.333
Wait, so people just
use drugs openly?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.667
I mean, doesn't that
encourage drug use?

19:29.667 --> 19:31.433
Well, Emily, people are using
these drugs

19:31.433 --> 19:32.667
whether we like it or not.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.100
And places like Insite
prevents them

19:35.100 --> 19:36.500
from dying unnecessarily.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.667
On Thanksgiving weekend
last year,

19:38.667 --> 19:42.333
33 people overdosed
at Insite on Fentanyl,

19:42.333 --> 19:45.700
and none of them died because
there were people there to help.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.733
Sadly, down the street,
a young woman injected alone

19:48.733 --> 19:51.733
in a hotel room,
and she died.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.367
These deaths are preventable.

19:53.367 --> 19:55.667
(Adam)
Injections sites
like Insite have operated

19:55.667 --> 19:58.167
across the world for decades,

19:58.167 --> 20:00.167
and in that time,
there has not been

20:00.167 --> 20:02.933
a single death
in any facility.

20:02.933 --> 20:04.400
(applause)
You know what?

20:04.400 --> 20:07.333
This actually makes
a lot of sense.

20:09.167 --> 20:12.433
We need to accept
that drug use is a fact of life.

20:12.433 --> 20:14.833
So, instead of demonizing weed
for no reason,

20:14.833 --> 20:16.867
or pushing zero tolerance,

20:16.867 --> 20:19.233
or throwing drug addicts
in jail,

20:19.233 --> 20:22.667
we should use harm reduction
so we can actually help people

20:22.667 --> 20:24.400
and save lives.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.233
So, how 'bout this?
Instead of "Just say no,"

20:27.233 --> 20:30.000
just say, "Go research
harm reduction strategies

20:30.000 --> 20:31.400
for your community!"

20:31.400 --> 20:33.233
Sorry, slogans are tough
for complex issues.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.500
(applause)

20:35.500 --> 20:37.500
Whoo!

20:37.500 --> 20:39.333
Whoa!
Drugs in a school?

20:39.333 --> 20:43.167
Young lady, you're going
away for a long time.

20:43.167 --> 20:45.000
It's not what it looks like,
I was just holding them

20:45.000 --> 20:46.567
for a friend. Adam!
Let's go!

20:46.567 --> 20:48.033
You need to fix this!

20:48.033 --> 20:49.900
I will, and it'll be
a great opportunity

20:49.900 --> 20:51.233
to teach you about everything
that's wrong

20:51.233 --> 20:52.833
with the prison system.

20:52.833 --> 20:54.600
No, no, no, you're going
to do it this episode,

20:54.600 --> 20:56.167
or I will lose my...

21:01.600 --> 21:03.867
(sighs deeply)

21:03.867 --> 21:06.933
(mumbling)
Adam Conover and his
stupid TV show.
