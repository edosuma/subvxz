WEBVTT

00:03.471 --> 00:05.106
I haven't started off well
in BlueBell,

00:05.106 --> 00:06.607
with sabotaging
the parade

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and making an archenemy
of your fiancée.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.111
You know how difficult
this is for me.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.545
Difficult never stopped me.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.282
I'm so sorry that I
don't know what I want.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.216
We got to figure out a way
to get along.

00:16.216 --> 00:18.452
You're right.
So maybe we
can be friends.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.321
I'd like that.
Yeah.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.423
Sure are taking your time
with that bandage, Doc.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.657
ZOE:
 I don't understand.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.593
There must be some single guys
in BlueBell.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.595
SHELLEY:
 Well, there's always Wade.
 You did nearly hook up

00:27.595 --> 00:29.630
with him.
Yeah, and that was a mistake,
mistake, mistake.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.565
ZOE:
 I didn't give Judson a chance.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.767
Can I buy you
a drink?
Yeah.
Great.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.103
LEMON:
 Guess it turns out

00:35.103 --> 00:36.204
we can be friends.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.671
I don't think we can.

00:37.671 --> 00:38.672
Why not?

00:38.672 --> 00:40.341
Because I still love you.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.813
Ready! Okay!

00:45.813 --> 00:48.048
(cheer squad chanting)

00:58.192 --> 00:59.460
ZOE:
Oh, look.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.728
It's my favorite guy.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.396
(pig grunts)

01:02.396 --> 01:04.665
And you, Judson.
How are you?

01:04.665 --> 01:05.799
Doing well.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.535
Is Bo feeling okay?

01:07.535 --> 01:09.270
Oh, he's much better.
Right.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.504
So you're just walking him
'cause he

01:10.504 --> 01:11.839
makes you
such a ladies' magnet

01:11.839 --> 01:13.141
or...?
It's homecoming.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.942
Got to watch team mascot
over the weekend,

01:14.942 --> 01:17.678
make sure the rival team
doesn't get any funny ideas.

01:17.678 --> 01:18.879
(chuckles)

01:18.879 --> 01:20.548
All right.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.150
Come on, Bo.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.285
Bye, Bo.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.755
Big Blue! Big Blue!
Big Blue!

01:27.755 --> 01:29.290
Big Blue! Big Blue!

01:29.290 --> 01:31.892
Big Blue! Big Blue!

01:31.892 --> 01:34.762
* *

01:47.441 --> 01:49.510
What's wrong now, Happy?

01:49.510 --> 01:51.712
Another bullfrog
in your bed?

01:51.712 --> 01:54.282
Too many grits,
not enough patients?

01:54.282 --> 01:56.184
No. This whole
homecoming thing

01:56.184 --> 01:57.851
is bringing me
down, Lavon.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.086
Oh, come on, now.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.189
It's football
and family and friends.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.856
What's not to love?

02:02.856 --> 02:03.991
Nothing.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.459
Homecoming is awesome--

02:05.459 --> 02:07.695
if you're from the town
everyone is coming home to.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.562
If you just moved
to that town,

02:09.562 --> 02:11.732
it's just another reminder
that you don't fit in

02:11.732 --> 02:14.034
and nobody knows you,
blah, blah, blah.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.603
Hey, hold on.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.838
I might be able
to help you out with this.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.475
See, every year,
Lavon Hayes hosts

02:21.475 --> 02:23.477
the Thursday night
pregame party.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.613
Folks just love my crab dip,

02:25.613 --> 02:27.881
my mix CDs,

02:27.881 --> 02:29.717
my apple martinis.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.885
Thing is, I'm a little
overextended at the moment.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.288
You know, coach's mama took ill,
he had to leave town,

02:34.288 --> 02:35.689
asked me to take over for him.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.825
Is there an assistant coach
for that kind of stuff?

02:37.825 --> 02:40.761
Assistant coaches don't always
win homecoming games.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.364
NFL champions,
on the other hand...

02:43.364 --> 02:44.998
That's right--
you're very special.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.334
I get it.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.835
How is this helping me?

02:47.835 --> 02:49.370
You can host the party.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.104
Give you
a chance to, uh,

02:51.104 --> 02:52.440
participate
in the town festivities.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.442
I've never
thrown anything

02:54.442 --> 02:56.677
this big by myself before.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.178
You know what?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.513
I have a friend in New York--

02:59.513 --> 03:00.714
she's a professional
party planner.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.250
I'll call her
and ask for advice.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.184
Yeah.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.519
Uh, no, you don't need
a professional.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.455
It's pretty much just, uh,
chips and salsa,

03:07.455 --> 03:09.790
whatever beer is on sale
at the local Dixie Stop.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.559
Look, here's, um,
my usual shopping list

03:11.559 --> 03:13.827
if you want to use it
for a jumping-off point.

03:13.827 --> 03:14.862
Thanks, Big Z.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.664
Well... thank you.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.740
We need to talk.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.041
I'm meeting some friends
for breakfast.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.109
It's rude to be late.

03:29.109 --> 03:32.413
Lemon, I told you I loved you.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.915
Now, you-you can't
just ignore me.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.826
ANNABETH:
...right into
Kimmy's garage door.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.296
I mean, we all know
she likes to sing in the car

03:48.296 --> 03:49.763
with her eyes closed,
so that's crazy.

03:49.763 --> 03:50.864
Oh. (chuckles)

03:50.864 --> 03:53.000
So what are y'all
talking about?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.268
Sophomore year.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.669
Homecoming weekend.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.170
Wasn't that the most fun?

03:57.170 --> 03:58.906
Suppose I don't remember.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.007
Don't remember?

04:00.007 --> 04:02.410
You almost burned down
the football stadium.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.677
LEMON:
That was
a long time ago.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.347
Might as well have been
a different person.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.852
So... what time is everyone

04:11.852 --> 04:14.154
going over to Lavon's
tomorrow night?

04:14.154 --> 04:16.589
Well, I'm afraid
that George and I

04:16.589 --> 04:18.125
won't be attending the party.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.461
My poor fiancé is still
hobbling around on crutches

04:20.461 --> 04:21.995
thanks to that terrible
crossbow incident,

04:21.995 --> 04:26.199
and I just don't feel right
leaving him all by himself.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.669
You are such
a good person, Lemon.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.338
Well, I try.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.673
I do.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.075
Mimosa.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.345
Not a waiter, Lemon;
bartender.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.746
Thank you.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.180
(door opens)
MAN (chuckling):
Yeah!

04:40.180 --> 04:41.349
What's happening, man?

04:41.349 --> 04:43.083
Good to see you.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.353
What's going on, man?

04:54.362 --> 04:57.365
No way.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.934
(phone ringing)

05:04.237 --> 05:05.639
Hey, Wade.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.975
Don't tell me you need
another divorce already.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.977
Guess who just walked
into the Rammer Jammer.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.379
Jimmy Praboo.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.481
Jimmy Praboo?
Well, get out of town.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.915
Are you sure it's him?
Oh, 100%.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.084
I could smell the stench of evil
a mile away.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.919
Guess you know what this means,
don't you?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.621
Don't tell me
you still have the list.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.122
Waiting in my drawer

05:22.122 --> 05:23.391
the last ten years.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.725
Nobody--but nobody--

05:24.725 --> 05:26.927
puts heat rub
in George Tucker's jock

05:26.927 --> 05:28.161
and gets away with it.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.398
Yeah, that was a, uh...
that was an unfortunate week.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.065
So you in?

05:32.065 --> 05:33.534
Hell, yeah.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.803
But I'll tell you what--
why don't you come over

05:35.803 --> 05:36.937
to Lemon's instead?
'Cause she's cooking.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.806
There's always
way too much food.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.273
How's 7:30 sound for you?

05:40.273 --> 05:41.642
I'll see you then, Mighty Mouse.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.111
Later on, Donkey Kong.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.955
(phone beeps, line ringing)

05:54.955 --> 05:55.889
(cell phone ringing)

05:55.889 --> 05:57.958
(phone beeps)
WOMAN: Hello, darling.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.027
I'm having sex
with Ryan Gosling right now.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.294
He says hi.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.295
Oh, should I call back, or..?

06:02.295 --> 06:03.464
Never. Even if I were

06:03.464 --> 06:04.832
having sex with Ryan Gosling,
I would

06:04.832 --> 06:06.434
kick him out of bed
just to talk to you.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.068
That is how much I love you.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.302
Now, tell me everything.

06:09.302 --> 06:12.105
What has become of my poor,
sweet, exiled little waif?

06:12.105 --> 06:13.306
Have you succumbed to a life

06:13.306 --> 06:15.142
of hayrides
and chicken-fried steaks?

06:15.142 --> 06:16.544
No. And it's not that bad.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.878
I'm surviving.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.279
Actually, the reason
I called you

06:19.279 --> 06:21.248
is because I'm throwing
a party tomorrow night,

06:21.248 --> 06:22.616
and I need your advice
on something.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.917
Ask away, darling.

06:23.917 --> 06:24.985
Okay, let's say

06:24.985 --> 06:27.688
you were in the market
for a Jell-O mold.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.791
Is there a certain flavor
that's better than the others,

06:30.791 --> 06:32.693
or do all molds
pretty much taste the same?

06:32.693 --> 06:34.462
I'm sorry.
I think the connection's bad.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.329
Did you just say Jell-O mold?

06:36.329 --> 06:38.065
(knocking)

06:38.065 --> 06:39.032
Zoe, you have a minute?

06:39.032 --> 06:41.201
I'm going to call you back,
okay?

06:41.201 --> 06:42.470
Bye.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.671
(phone beeps off)

06:44.538 --> 06:45.773
This is, uh,
Colby Slaughter,

06:45.773 --> 06:47.641
starting quarterback
for the BlueBell Blue.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.009
He just puked
on the field.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.344
Bummer.
How do you feel now, Colby?

06:51.344 --> 06:53.947
(coughing)

06:53.947 --> 06:55.415
Not too good.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.622
Your eyes are pretty watery.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.223
Have they been
bothering you all day?

07:03.223 --> 07:04.592
Since yesterday.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.460
I thought it was just a cold,
but then my stomach

07:06.460 --> 07:07.661
started hurting
this morning and...

07:07.661 --> 07:09.597
It sounds like you
just caught a bad flu.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.699
Like a 24-hour
kind of flu?

07:11.699 --> 07:13.634
Maybe... but you shouldn't
practice anymore today.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.068
You don't want
to overexert yourself.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.303
But I have to practice.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.205
The game is only
two days away.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.573
LAVON:
Now, now, Colby.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.841
It's just a game.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.644
Your health is more important
than football.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.813
He'll be okay by Friday, right?
Two whole days off.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.750
I'll have Addy run a blood test,
make sure there's no infection.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.018
But just to be safe,

07:31.018 --> 07:32.620
you'd better prep your
other quarterback.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.088
But Joey sucks.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.992
Yeah, he does, Colby.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.795
Yeah, he does.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.599
WADE: Lemon.
(snaps fingers)

07:45.599 --> 07:46.934
Another beer.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.269
You snap those fingers at me
one more time, Wade,

07:49.269 --> 07:50.838
I swear to God I will chop them

07:50.838 --> 07:52.472
off that dainty
little hand of yours.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.674
Hey, come on,
now, y'all.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.942
Let's... let's
try and remember

07:54.942 --> 07:56.309
who the real enemy
is here.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.545
Not my enemy.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.813
I don't even remember
a Jimmy Praboo.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.048
He was three years
ahead of us

08:01.048 --> 08:02.415
when Wade and I
joined the football team,

08:02.415 --> 08:04.217
and he took it
upon himself

08:04.217 --> 08:06.219
to make our lives miserable.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.922
I mean, he would steal our
jerseys, he would make us...

08:08.922 --> 08:10.824
make us late to practice,
and he would put

08:10.824 --> 08:11.925
shaving cream
in our helmets.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.594
Tell her about the heat rub.

08:16.029 --> 08:19.199
Let's just say
that he deserves

08:19.199 --> 08:20.568
what is coming to him.

08:20.568 --> 08:21.969
But who cares?

08:21.969 --> 08:24.437
It was a million years ago.
Hey.

08:24.437 --> 08:25.505
I care.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.507
Yes, of course
you care, Wade,

08:27.507 --> 08:28.942
'cause you're still a child.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.844
But, George, honey, it's...
it's beneath you.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.245
It is.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.047
A little bit.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.849
You're right.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.284
But there is a sense of justice
being done here,

08:38.284 --> 08:39.787
and I am a lawyer,

08:39.787 --> 08:41.321
and, Lemon, you
do not understand

08:41.321 --> 08:42.455
the pain that was...

08:42.455 --> 08:43.724
There was a...
there was a burning.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.593
It was... it was just a...
it was a burning.

08:45.593 --> 08:48.295
Which is why I still say
we go with number four.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.565
Can't even read this.
This says, uh, uh...

08:51.565 --> 08:53.533
"Fill his locker
with tarantulas"?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.869
And you realize...

08:55.869 --> 08:57.938
he doesn't have
a locker anymore.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.407
So we fill his car
with tarantulas!

09:00.407 --> 09:02.876
Though I guess that would take
twice the amount of tarantulas.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.878
I know a guy who can
get them on the cheap.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.614
Okay. What
else we got?

09:06.614 --> 09:09.116
I still think
number six is doable.

09:09.116 --> 09:12.219
All we need's a helicopter
and a tiny monkey.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.188
Oh, for heaven's sake.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.632
Lemon... help us.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.867
What? Excuse me?
What?

09:26.867 --> 09:29.002
You are a natural at this,
sweetheart, and you know that.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.138
And nobody ever pulled off a
prank quite like Lemon Breeland.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.973
I-I still don't know
how you got that cow

09:32.973 --> 09:34.441
into Mrs. Gleason's
office,

09:34.441 --> 09:36.777
but watching her try to lure
that thing down the stairs--

09:36.777 --> 09:38.378
that was amazing.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.647
Okay, for the record,

09:39.647 --> 09:41.649
Mrs. Gleason was being
terribly unfair

09:41.649 --> 09:43.516
about allowing me
to retake the vocabulary test.

09:43.516 --> 09:44.918
She had it coming.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.920
So does Jimmy Praboo.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.021
No.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.057
No.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.671
Gigi!

10:04.872 --> 10:06.539
You said
Jell-O mold,

10:06.539 --> 10:08.508
I heard nervous breakdown.

10:08.508 --> 10:09.576
I can't believe you're here.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.011
The flight
was only two hours.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.647
Pierre let me borrow his plane,
so it was easy-peasy.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.949
Oh, before I forget...

10:16.616 --> 10:18.051
ZOE:
Zabar's?

10:18.051 --> 10:20.620
I figured BlueBell
doesn't do bagels.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.155
There's kosher salami
in there, too.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.824
That's your favorite, right?

10:23.824 --> 10:25.759
Can I kiss you?
Would that be weird?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.662
So I want to hear
about you

10:28.662 --> 10:30.197
and BlueBell

10:30.197 --> 10:32.365
and this amazing party
you're throwing.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.601
I don't know how amazing
it's going to be.

10:34.601 --> 10:35.836
It's basically just
a football thing.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.537
The town's gearing
up for a big

10:37.537 --> 10:38.872
homecoming game
this weekend.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.507
Homecoming. Adorable.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.743
It's... it's like
 Friday Night Lights,

10:42.743 --> 10:45.078
but without all
the depressing parts.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.315
Wow.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.683
So, then, your party

10:49.683 --> 10:52.519
is, like,
a big deal.

10:52.519 --> 10:55.723
I hereby offer you my official
party planning services,

10:55.723 --> 10:57.657
free of charge.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.426
You're welcome.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.930
You wanting to help
is so sweet,

11:02.930 --> 11:06.399
but I don't know if BlueBell
is ready for a full-scale

11:06.399 --> 11:08.769
Gigi Godfrey event.
I'm still trying to fit in here.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.937
So we'll do it just right.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.740
Just wait. By this
time tomorrow night,

11:12.740 --> 11:15.475
Zoe Hart is going

11:15.475 --> 11:17.477
to own BlueBell.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.912
Cheers!

11:44.805 --> 11:46.339
Oh. Omelet or scramble?

11:46.339 --> 11:47.775
I've gotten pretty
good at both,

11:47.775 --> 11:49.843
although the soft boil
still eludes me.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.044
Why are your
shoes green?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.847
I have no idea.
I'm not even awake.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.482
Sorry about that.
It's my bad.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.785
I had the lawn greened up
for the party tonight.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.152
You know, wanted the place
to look nice.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.620
I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you,

12:00.620 --> 12:02.722
what with the crazy football
uniform you're wearing.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.257
(chuckles)
I'm going to practice.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.794
Yeah, I thought this might
help inspire the kids.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.996
Lord knows,
they're gonna need it.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.697
You're inspiring me right now.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.000
Lavon, this is my friend Gigi.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.268
She's helping me with the party.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.736
Gigi, this is Lavon.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.406
Your shopping list was
so helpful, Lavon.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.474
Thanks for the great tips.

12:21.474 --> 12:22.876
My pleasure.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.277
Oh, another word
to the wise.

12:24.277 --> 12:27.480
Double up on the crab dip.
It's a crowd pleaser.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.849
Good to know.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.650
Have fun, you two.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.920
(Lavon and Gigi chuckle)

12:35.488 --> 12:36.689
I see why you had

12:36.689 --> 12:38.291
to bring Lemon in on this.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.727
(sighs)
Why are you making such a
big deal out of this, huh?

12:40.727 --> 12:42.329
I mean, the three of
us used to hang out

12:42.329 --> 12:43.763
all the time back
in high school.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.932
Yeah, back when she was fun.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.066
She still is fun.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.434
She is just stressed out,
all right?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.136
She's got the holidays
coming up and, you know,

12:49.136 --> 12:50.237
she's got all the
wedding plans.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.504
Look, this is a chance for her

12:51.504 --> 12:53.206
to blow off some steam
and have a good time.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.242
She doesn't know how to have
a good time anymore, man.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.977
She's-she's-she's stiffer
than a...

12:56.977 --> 12:59.612
(door opens)
Do not finish that thought.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.781
Afternoon, gentlemen.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.916
Hey.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.288
Who wants tuna fish
and who wants turkey?

13:08.288 --> 13:11.391
Oh, baby, you didn't have to go
through all this trouble.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.926
Turkey's got cheese,
though, right?

13:12.926 --> 13:13.961
Of course, sweetheart.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.195
Hey, this is supposed

13:15.195 --> 13:16.763
to be a strategizing
session, not a pic...

13:16.763 --> 13:18.531
(lotion squishes)

13:18.531 --> 13:20.000
a picnic.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.402
What's this?

13:22.402 --> 13:25.105
That is the official
BlueBell itinerary

13:25.105 --> 13:26.306
for homecoming weekend.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.774
If you flip to page
three, you will see

13:27.774 --> 13:29.042
that Jimmy Praboo
is officiating

13:29.042 --> 13:31.578
the coin toss
at the game this Friday night.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.645
Now, that is where

13:32.645 --> 13:34.381
we want to get him.
Hey, Lemon?

13:34.381 --> 13:37.350
We don't need a location
for the prank. We need a prank.

13:37.350 --> 13:41.788
And the key to pulling off a
perfect prank is specificity.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.090
I cannot practice proper

13:43.090 --> 13:44.925
psychological warfare
until I understand

13:44.925 --> 13:46.894
the psyche of who
I'm dealing with.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.561
Now, she's just making up words.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.796
If you want my help

13:49.796 --> 13:50.964
in destroying Jimmy Praboo,

13:50.964 --> 13:53.066
I need to know
his Achilles Heel.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.702
His fatal flaw, if you will.

13:55.702 --> 13:57.337
Jimmy's real vain.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.605
He's a real

13:58.605 --> 14:00.207
pretty boy type.
He never left

14:00.207 --> 14:02.809
the locker room without making
sure every hair was just so.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.744
He used a lot of mousse.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.814
Oh... that is perfect.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.382
What is perfect?

14:09.382 --> 14:11.718
Boys, I'm gonna need
some Fun Sip...

14:11.718 --> 14:13.853
Blue Raspberry.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.462
That would be fabulous.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.796
I owe you one, Tom.

14:23.796 --> 14:24.864
Ciao, darling.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.266
Hi.
Hi.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.134
Tom?

14:27.134 --> 14:29.036
Colicchio.
I'm flying him in,

14:29.036 --> 14:32.005
but only if we like his
menu more than Susan's.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.273
Take a look.
Well, I see

14:33.273 --> 14:34.674
you're keeping everything
under control.

14:34.674 --> 14:37.010
Just read the menu and
tell me you're not in love

14:37.010 --> 14:38.211
because I am in love.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.014
And I am going to exercise
my veto power.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.283
On which one?
All of it.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.618
Gigi, it's too much.
I know these people.

14:45.618 --> 14:46.719
Seared octopus is not going to

14:46.719 --> 14:47.887
appeal to their palates.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.022
Maybe you're
underestimating them.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.023
Trust me, I'm not.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.959
Fine. Then it's your

14:51.959 --> 14:53.860
responsibility to help them.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.063
Show them what they've been
missing all their lives.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.897
Let your New York flag fly!

14:57.897 --> 14:58.999
They don't like
my New York flag.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.167
They don't even like my shorts.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.601
Sweetie, can I be honest?

15:01.601 --> 15:03.003
From what you've told me,

15:03.003 --> 15:06.073
you've spent a lot of time and
effort trying to fit in here,

15:06.073 --> 15:07.274
but it hasn't
worked; you've got

15:07.274 --> 15:08.675
one friend,
and you pay him rent.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.610
There's also Shelley...

15:10.610 --> 15:12.512
rapidly becoming
a legitimate acquaintance.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.413
Maybe it's time

15:13.413 --> 15:15.048
to show this town the real you,

15:15.048 --> 15:16.316
the amazing you,

15:16.316 --> 15:19.386
and let them fall in
love with that person--

15:19.386 --> 15:20.653
the way I did...

15:20.653 --> 15:24.657
the way the best city on the
entire freaking planet did.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.326
New York loves Zoe Hart!

15:26.326 --> 15:29.329
New York really did love me,
didn't it? We totally hung out.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.064
Damn straight!
You rocked that city,

15:31.064 --> 15:33.566
and you could do
the same here, but not

15:33.566 --> 15:35.235
if you're afraid
to give people

15:35.235 --> 15:37.370
your best stuff.
Do you trust me?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.339
I do...

15:39.339 --> 15:41.374
Excellent.
Now, let's discuss cocktails.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.410
Okay.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.181
Hey, Zoe.

15:53.686 --> 15:54.721
Care to share?

15:54.721 --> 15:56.323
Nothing to tell.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.425
He's the local veterinarian;
we almost went out on a date,

15:58.425 --> 15:59.826
but then we didn't, because...

15:59.826 --> 16:00.860
Because he's gay?

16:00.860 --> 16:02.829
What?! No!
Oh, honey,

16:02.829 --> 16:03.963
(laughing): please!

16:03.963 --> 16:06.566
What, what are you doing?

16:07.634 --> 16:10.903
Hi, I'm Zoe's friend, Gigi.
Hi.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.839
We're throwing a party tonight
at Vaughn's house,

16:12.839 --> 16:15.042
and we would love
for you to come.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.309
That does sound like fun.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.211
Unfortunately,
I got to watch a pig tonight.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.447
The more the merrier!
See you at 8:00.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.552
(clears throat)

16:25.552 --> 16:27.087
See? Gay.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.121
You're insane.

16:28.121 --> 16:31.858
(chuckles)
(text alert sounds)

16:31.858 --> 16:33.160
Oh! How could this
possibly happen?!

16:33.160 --> 16:35.128
My backup quarterback is out,
too!

16:35.128 --> 16:36.796
ZOE:
Flus are contagious.
Viruses spread.

16:36.796 --> 16:41.268
And these boys are literally on
top of each other all day long.

16:41.268 --> 16:44.204
It's unfortunate,
but not that surprising.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.306
Is there some kind
of mysterious

16:46.306 --> 16:48.108
quarterback flu
I don't know about?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.809
Like swine flu or bird flu?

16:49.809 --> 16:51.144
None that are

16:51.144 --> 16:53.480
registered with the CDC,
but I can double-check.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.148
Please do!

16:55.148 --> 16:57.917
Because Lavon Hayes
does not accept defeat!

16:57.917 --> 17:01.288
Unless he doesn't have
any quarterbacks to play,

17:01.288 --> 17:03.556
in which case,
Lavon Hayes is screwed.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.726
Well, Colby's lab work came back
negative for group A strep.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.329
I can run more tests,
do a culture for pertussis,

17:09.329 --> 17:10.563
see if I missed anything.

17:10.563 --> 17:14.467
(raised voice):
If only Colby were here...

17:18.570 --> 17:22.309
Oh, look at that.
Colby's here.

17:22.309 --> 17:25.244
For the record, I didn't let him
on the field.

17:25.244 --> 17:26.846
Colby, I told you to stay in bed

17:26.846 --> 17:27.980
and get some rest.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.416
I'm just watching.
In case I feel

17:29.416 --> 17:31.017
better tomorrow,
I want to be ready.

17:31.017 --> 17:32.185
Yeah, well, in
the meantime,

17:32.185 --> 17:34.020
you could be infecting
the entire team

17:34.020 --> 17:36.055
with whatever it is
that you have.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.625
Colby, go home!

17:38.625 --> 17:40.327
Joey, go home.

17:40.327 --> 17:43.663
Everyone else,
you're all getting a physical.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.165
Who's first?

17:45.165 --> 17:46.466
Get out of the way!
Me first!

17:46.466 --> 17:48.067
Hey, hey,
one at a time.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.736
Out of the way!
(clamoring)

17:49.736 --> 17:52.205
Look out, Bob!
No, no, no, no.
Me first.

18:04.717 --> 18:05.718
Oh, no.

18:05.718 --> 18:06.886
Yay! You're home!

18:06.886 --> 18:09.589
I got the best hookup for
cater waiters in Mobile.

18:09.589 --> 18:13.092
Those two were dancers in that
movie with Cher and Christina.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.761
So much dirt.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.630
Gigi, I have just had
the longest day.
I know.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.099
I expected you home forever ago.
But don't worry,

18:20.099 --> 18:21.501
I've got it
under control.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.470
Although the fact that
you haven't even mentioned

18:23.470 --> 18:25.071
my dress yet
is deeply upsetting.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.973
I'm sorry. It's great.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.475
I knew you'd love it.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.776
Still finishing up my face.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.644
Wait until you see
what you're wearing.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.547
Uh, but I don't, I don't,
I haven't thought about...

18:34.547 --> 18:35.648
Ta-dah!

18:35.648 --> 18:37.984
I saw it at Bergdorf's
yesterday and had

18:37.984 --> 18:39.085
to get it for you.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.320
Doesn't it remind you

18:40.320 --> 18:42.155
of that dress you wore
at Zach's party?

18:42.155 --> 18:44.791
Zach's party. Um...

18:44.791 --> 18:47.126
This is going to beat it.
The people here

18:47.126 --> 18:49.362
are going to die when
they see you in this.

18:49.362 --> 18:52.965
They're going to erect
a statue in your honor.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.133
(phone rings)

18:54.133 --> 18:56.636
Talk to me.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.111
Okay.
And you got the wrench?

19:05.111 --> 19:07.714
You know, I'm a little sick
and tired of being treated

19:07.714 --> 19:09.449
like an underling
in this operation.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.187
As of yet, I don't have
any reason to believe, Lemon,

19:14.187 --> 19:17.190
that your ideas are
any better than, say mi...

19:17.190 --> 19:18.057
Whoa!

19:18.057 --> 19:19.659
(laughs)

19:20.026 --> 19:21.361
Cool!

19:21.361 --> 19:23.162
Oh, that is more than cool.
It's effective.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.165
If I were to turn that hose
on you right now, it'd stain

19:26.165 --> 19:27.434
your skin bright blue!

19:27.434 --> 19:28.935
You are freaking amazing.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.470
I'll admit it's got style,

19:30.470 --> 19:32.004
but I still don't see how
we're supposed to smuggle

19:32.004 --> 19:34.207
a garden hose into a football
stadium full of people

19:34.207 --> 19:35.375
without getting caught.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.943
Oh, sweet, simple Wade,

19:36.943 --> 19:38.211
your mama must've

19:38.211 --> 19:40.247
dropped you on your
head as a child.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.614
(chuckles)

19:41.614 --> 19:43.182
Here's how it's gonna go down,
soldiers.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.319
Tonight, while Jimmy's out
to dinner with his Nana Betsy,

19:46.319 --> 19:48.421
we are going to break
into his hotel room

19:48.421 --> 19:49.889
and fill the showerhead
with the powder.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.091
After dinner,
he'll come back to change.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.760
He's a pretty boy, right?

19:53.760 --> 19:55.895
There's no way that he'll go
straight from dinner with Nana

19:55.895 --> 19:57.997
to Lavon's party
without a quick shower.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.499
Two seconds under that spray,

19:59.499 --> 20:02.134
and he will be blue as a Smurf
for the whole weekend!

20:02.134 --> 20:03.436
And he'll stay home.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.238
Game over.
Oh, he will

20:05.238 --> 20:06.773
opt out of Lavon's for sure.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.541
But he can't
miss the game.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.177
After all, he is officiating
the coin toss.

20:11.177 --> 20:12.579
He has to be there.

20:16.249 --> 20:19.118
She's back, ladies
and gentlemen!

20:19.118 --> 20:21.254
Wait!
Wait a second.

20:21.254 --> 20:24.223
Okay, all right,
all right. Oh, baby!

20:24.223 --> 20:26.192
Quick, quick,
put me down!

20:26.192 --> 20:29.596
(laughing):
Oh, my God!

20:29.596 --> 20:31.464
* *

20:36.436 --> 20:39.138
Welcome everyone!

20:39.138 --> 20:40.540
Enjoy our signature cocktail.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.376
A blue moon for the fabulous
people of BlueBell.

20:43.376 --> 20:46.212
Why is it purple?

20:46.212 --> 20:49.316
Blue is so blah, and purple
just pops, don't you think?!

20:49.316 --> 20:50.883
It's the crème
de violette

20:50.883 --> 20:52.452
that gives it the color.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.886
It tastes good.

20:53.886 --> 20:56.589
I promise.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.625
Hm-mm.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.561
Good Lord!

21:01.561 --> 21:03.696
It's like a bordello threw up
in the mayor's house.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.865
We went
with a bold color palette.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.500
I think it looks pretty.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.568
Lavon's gonna love it.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.537
You mean, he hasn't seen it yet?

21:10.537 --> 21:12.204
No. He's still
at practice.

21:12.204 --> 21:14.607
(wry chuckle)
Oh...

21:14.607 --> 21:18.445
DASH:
Zoe! This party is

21:18.445 --> 21:19.712
capital F for fabulous.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.582
Molecular gastronomy
in BlueBell!

21:22.582 --> 21:24.717
I'm gonna give it
a rave in my blog.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.853
Then again, I'm probably
the only one in this town

21:26.853 --> 21:29.789
who appreciates
a good truffle foam.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.424
(chuckles)

21:31.424 --> 21:34.193
I don't understand this food.

21:34.193 --> 21:35.462
It's foamy!

21:35.462 --> 21:37.597
Foamy faux hoagies?

21:37.597 --> 21:40.733
It-It's just not right.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.203
Hi.
Judson!

21:44.203 --> 21:45.338
Hey, you came.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.506
Yeah. A purple drink!
This is fancy.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.874
Where's Bo?

21:47.874 --> 21:49.742
I thought he was your
responsibility all weekend.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.744
My cousin is watching him
this weekend.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.381
Were those guys in Burlesque?

21:55.348 --> 21:57.550
Love that movie.

22:19.205 --> 22:21.708
Jimmy Praboo.
Twelve o'clock.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.489
(whispering):
Wait. There's the shower.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.858
Next comes the scream.

22:38.858 --> 22:39.859
(Jimmy screams)

22:39.859 --> 22:41.127
(stifled laughter)

22:41.127 --> 22:42.495
(shower curtain rattles)

22:42.495 --> 22:43.496
(loud thud)

22:43.496 --> 22:46.399
(shower still running)

22:46.399 --> 22:49.402
That can't be good.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.777
Seared doesn't mean hot.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.813
I just want chicken fingers.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.117
I hear you have
a new friend in town.

23:05.117 --> 23:08.788
No big deal. I thought
we were friends, but...

23:08.788 --> 23:10.289
whatever.

23:10.289 --> 23:11.924
You can have two.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.126
However, your lack
of chicken fingers?

23:14.126 --> 23:16.128
That's unforgiveable.

23:19.466 --> 23:20.933
Is that a fanny pack?

23:20.933 --> 23:23.402
I needed a place to
store my cell phone,

23:23.402 --> 23:26.105
and I like to use
two hands when I dance.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.407
You don't wear that thing
in public; it's rude.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.577
Rudimentary...
in its convenience.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.579
Nice to see you, Wanda.
(whimpers)

23:32.579 --> 23:34.681
I can't believe you actually
defended that thing.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.716
My eyes are still
recovering from the sight.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.485
Come on.
She's really nice.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.923
We need to talk.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.760
What on earth were
you thinking, girl?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.462
This party is... whew.

23:49.462 --> 23:51.831
There are no words.
I'm so, so sorry.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.866
I was just trying to take
BlueBell to the next level.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.235
But instead I made it bad
and wrong, and I'm pretty sure

23:56.235 --> 23:57.937
one of the cater waiters
flashed the minister,

23:57.937 --> 24:00.139
so I think I'm actually
going to hell.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.208
What should I do?
I don't, I don't know, Zoe.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.410
Uh, I gotta come up with
a game plan for tomorrow.

24:04.410 --> 24:07.179
Look, maybe you should just
consider this a life lesson

24:07.179 --> 24:08.447
and shut it down.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.749
Shutting it down.
Done and done.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.183
That is the best idea ever.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.652
What was the best idea?

24:12.652 --> 24:14.754
My idea.
Where the party ends.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.789
Now.
What are you talking about?

24:16.789 --> 24:18.457
It's not even 10:00.
ZOE:
Gigi...

24:18.457 --> 24:20.226
the party didn't work.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.694
Excuse me?

24:21.694 --> 24:23.630
This party totally works.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.197
It's these people
who don't work.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.766
Gigi.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.334
Look, I'll have you know that
these are the finest people

24:28.334 --> 24:30.803
this side of Alabama, now.
Oh, so we're grading on a curve?

24:30.803 --> 24:32.338
I know you did not
just say that.

24:32.338 --> 24:33.840
All right, you two, just stop,
all right? Calm down.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.476
My party is amazing.
I think you mean my party.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.646
I think you both mean my party.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.380
Zoe.
What?

24:41.380 --> 24:43.683
Shutting down.
Right now.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.152
You must be kidding me.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.520
You...

24:47.520 --> 24:49.121
(grunts)

24:49.121 --> 24:51.023
(knocking)

24:57.129 --> 24:58.264
What are you doing?

24:58.264 --> 24:59.532
I need your help.

24:59.532 --> 25:00.933
I can't. I promised Lavon

25:00.933 --> 25:02.535
that I would shut
down this party.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.671
What the hell are you doing?

25:04.671 --> 25:06.539
It's a medical emergency, Doc.

25:06.539 --> 25:07.874
Lemon might've killed someone.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.702
See? This is what happens
when you unleash Crazy Lemon.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.236
Oh, my God, I'm going
to prison, George.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.939
Do you know what they do
to girls like me in prison?

25:39.939 --> 25:41.273
I do.

25:41.273 --> 25:44.143
Oh, shut up, Wade. This is all
your fault in the first place.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.645
Okay, let's just all
try and calm down, here.
This is my fault?

25:45.645 --> 25:47.413
All I wanted to do was
pants a dude at a party.

25:47.413 --> 25:49.515
Then suddenly, you're on board,
and we're breaking and entering,

25:49.515 --> 25:51.083
and, and murdering people.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.152
(clears throat)

25:53.152 --> 25:54.253
He's not dead.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.554
Thank goodness.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.723
He is, however, blue.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.725
That part was intentional.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.327
Yeah. Does he have a concussion?
Anything like that?

26:01.327 --> 26:03.462
Just a gnarly bump on his head.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.131
But other than that, he's fine.

26:05.131 --> 26:08.134
Except that he is blue,
and that is still problematic.

26:08.134 --> 26:11.403
That part, Dr. Hart, is frankly
none of your business.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.273
I'm not the one who's asking.

26:14.273 --> 26:17.576
Then I saw myself in the mirror,
and I was all... all...

26:17.576 --> 26:19.545
Blue.
Blue.
Yeah.

26:19.545 --> 26:21.013
That was freaky.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.949
So I tried to rush out of there.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.917
Guess I must have slipped.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.219
Headfirst. Right through
the shower curtain.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.888
Jimmy? Um...

26:28.888 --> 26:30.389
We can't apologize enough.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.825
All right? It was supposed to
be a harmless little prank.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.961
After all the stuff you
did to us in high school.

26:34.961 --> 26:38.765
But obviously...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.066
I know you guys!

26:40.066 --> 26:43.002
Wade Kinsella and George Tucker.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.570
Man, I ain't even
recognize y'all.

26:44.570 --> 26:46.673
Probably 'cause you weren't
swirling our heads around

26:46.673 --> 26:48.240
in a toilet bowl.
Shh.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.776
What? He started it.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.310
You guys are ridiculous.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.646
You could have caused
some serious damage.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.047
I can call the sheriff for you.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.383
ZOE:
I'd be happy to do so.
No, I get it now.

26:57.383 --> 27:01.587
This is payback
for that heat rub thing, right?

27:01.587 --> 27:03.355
(clears throat)
Huh?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.993
Nice! You boys come a long way!

27:06.993 --> 27:07.894
(laughing)

27:07.894 --> 27:10.629
Look at.... You got
me good. Boom!

27:10.629 --> 27:12.164
(chuckling)
I'm blue!

27:12.164 --> 27:13.700
WADE:
Yep. You sure are.
I'm blue.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.734
Yeah.
Blue's blue.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.202
(giggles)

27:16.202 --> 27:19.038
All right, then. What say
we all go over to Lavon's?

27:19.038 --> 27:20.306
No!
No!

27:20.306 --> 27:23.042
How could you even consider
going to a party right now?

27:23.042 --> 27:25.277
I mean, how insensitive
can you be?

27:25.277 --> 27:27.479
It doesn't matter anyway,
because the party is over.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.881
How do I know the party's over?

27:28.881 --> 27:31.350
Because I'm going back
to end it right now.

27:36.622 --> 27:38.457
I'd go for some flapjacks.

27:38.457 --> 27:39.591
Yeah.

27:39.591 --> 27:41.694
I could. I could.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.467
I'm down.
(laughs)

27:48.467 --> 27:50.669
* *

27:56.743 --> 27:58.344
Where the hell did you go?

27:58.344 --> 27:59.278
I am so sorry.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.680
I was called to
a medical emergency.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.049
Well, I don't need
this right now.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.651
I got the, the coach
on the phone upstairs.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.153
You were supposed to
help me tonight, Zoe,

28:07.153 --> 28:09.221
not make things harder for me.

28:14.761 --> 28:18.530
Everybody out!

28:18.530 --> 28:20.666
Go!

28:20.666 --> 28:21.934
Good-bye.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.502
Thanks for coming.

28:23.502 --> 28:25.805
Nice blue colors.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.639
(turntable scratches)

28:27.639 --> 28:28.941
This is the worst

28:28.941 --> 28:31.043
homecoming party this
town has ever seen,

28:31.043 --> 28:33.112
and the one in '92
was hit by a tornado.

28:33.112 --> 28:37.649
Well, I will just make sure
that everybody remembers

28:37.649 --> 28:39.385
who hosted this travesty.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.822
Don't forget your party favor.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.356
Where the hell is Gigi?

28:48.060 --> 28:48.861
Oh.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.562
JUDSON:
Zoe.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.598
Hey.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.500
Good news!
He's not gay!

29:06.879 --> 29:08.781
You get my messages last night?

29:11.317 --> 29:13.052
Lemon.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.889
All right, just so you know?

29:16.889 --> 29:19.625
I didn't come over because it
felt like you want to be alone.

29:19.625 --> 29:23.429
It wasn't because I was more
interested the flapjacks.

29:25.131 --> 29:27.800
Okay, fine. I really,
really wanted flapjacks.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.001
But...

29:29.001 --> 29:31.770
I'm not mad at you, George.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.605
Are you sure?
'Cause you seem mad.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.174
I'm mad at myself.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.909
I shouldn't have gotten involved

29:36.909 --> 29:38.744
in that stupid prank
in the first place.

29:38.744 --> 29:41.480
I knew it was
a bad idea, and then...

29:41.480 --> 29:43.415
to have Zoe Hart,
of all people, call me an idiot

29:43.415 --> 29:44.450
and have she be right.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.818
Zoe doesn't know
anything about it.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.386
We were just having fun.

29:47.386 --> 29:50.256
But I don't want to have that
kind of fun anymore, George.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.590
I'm over it.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.792
Now look, I just...

29:54.660 --> 29:56.462
I just thought you missed it.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.899
I mean, being a free spirit,
and-and-and rebelling and all.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.101
I just...

30:03.936 --> 30:06.005
You just seemed so much
happier back then.

30:07.073 --> 30:09.541
Well, of course I was happy.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.210
I was 16 years old.

30:11.210 --> 30:14.246
It's easy to be footloose
and fancy-free when you have

30:14.246 --> 30:16.515
no responsibilities,
but that does not mean

30:16.515 --> 30:18.684
that I'm not happy now.

30:18.684 --> 30:20.319
Listen, I like

30:20.319 --> 30:23.055
clipping recipes
and making dinners,

30:23.055 --> 30:25.491
and I'm excited about this
new chapter in our lives.

30:25.491 --> 30:26.492
And so am I.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.328
I just thought that...

30:29.328 --> 30:33.365
Listen, you just
thought... that...

30:33.365 --> 30:36.602
I could be everything,
all the time, forever.

30:36.602 --> 30:40.940
I... can't be a wild child
and a mature woman,

30:40.940 --> 30:43.142
and I don't want to be.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.945
I-I don't want to be reckless.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.147
Believe me.

30:50.149 --> 30:51.450
It never ends well.

31:08.935 --> 31:10.502
What the hell is wrong with you?

31:10.502 --> 31:13.839
Is it 100% necessary
to be yelling right now?

31:13.839 --> 31:15.141
You destroyed my friend's house,

31:15.141 --> 31:16.642
and you abandoned
your own party.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.044
I thought it was your party.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.211
Then you slept with my vet.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.779
I didn't mean to sleep with him.

31:20.779 --> 31:25.084
I was doing a little recon to
confirm his sexual orientation--

31:25.084 --> 31:26.953
for your benefit,
I might add--

31:26.953 --> 31:28.820
and things got
a little out of control,

31:28.820 --> 31:30.289
which shouldn't be a big deal,

31:30.289 --> 31:33.125
considering you've never
even been out with the guy.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.727
You're acting like...
Like what?

31:35.727 --> 31:37.396
A morally stable individual,

31:37.396 --> 31:39.865
who knows the difference
between right and wrong?

31:39.865 --> 31:41.533
Yeah. Super judgy.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.402
Like all those jerks
who came over last night.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.737
Just because the people
didn't like your party,

31:45.737 --> 31:47.273
doesn't make them jerks.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.741
Attacking someone for matching
their sweater to their shoes,

31:49.741 --> 31:51.277
on the other hand...
Oh, please.

31:51.277 --> 31:54.013
How is that any different from
the time that you made fun of

31:54.013 --> 31:56.215
that girl for wearing
rhinestone cowboy boots?

31:56.215 --> 31:58.117
What girl?
What are you talking about?

31:58.117 --> 31:59.418
Last year.
Angie's party at Tenjune.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.819
Don't act like
you don't remember,

32:00.819 --> 32:02.688
because I can find it
on YouTube....

32:02.688 --> 32:04.957
Oh. Where's the bathroom?

32:08.494 --> 32:10.696
That's one classy lady
right there.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.600
I don't know
how to apologize to you.

32:15.701 --> 32:16.868
Ah, forget about it.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.570
I got bigger fish
to fry right now.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.839
With my QB still sick,

32:20.839 --> 32:22.108
may have
to forfeit the game.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.842
GIGI:
God. It's like

32:23.842 --> 32:25.711
a thousand degrees in here.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.079
Don't you people have A/C?

32:27.079 --> 32:28.714
What, do you have a cold
or something?

32:28.714 --> 32:31.517
I think I'm just hungover.
But it doesn't make any sense,

32:31.517 --> 32:34.253
considering I didn't
even drink last night.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.721
What's going on there?

32:35.721 --> 32:37.256
I have no idea.

32:37.256 --> 32:40.426
Oh. It must be from the grass.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.728
What were you doing rolling
around in the grass?

32:42.728 --> 32:44.363
Oh, my God.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.065
Did you have sex
with the vet outside?

32:46.065 --> 32:47.299
What vet?

32:47.299 --> 32:48.667
What, you mean your vet?

32:48.667 --> 32:50.469
We started outside.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.339
Then we moved inside.
It was a whole thing.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.207
She slept with your vet?

32:55.207 --> 32:56.942
I can't believe
I'm asking this,

32:56.942 --> 32:58.510
but is it possible

32:58.510 --> 33:04.216
that you ingested some
of the grass while you were...?

33:04.216 --> 33:06.685
Oh, yeah, I guess
it's possible.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.921
I mean, position-wise...

33:09.921 --> 33:11.257
No, no, no,

33:11.257 --> 33:13.192
no.

33:13.192 --> 33:16.528
Lavon, the people
who greened your lawn

33:16.528 --> 33:18.764
for the party,
did they also green the field

33:18.764 --> 33:20.099
for the big game?

33:20.099 --> 33:23.035
They sure did.
That's where I got the idea.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.372
ZOE:
 Organophosphate poisoning.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.774
The chemicals on the field
are what made you sick.

33:28.774 --> 33:31.810
General exposure won't
cause you any harm,

33:31.810 --> 33:33.479
but you guys are quarterbacks,

33:33.479 --> 33:35.247
so you're probably always
licking your fingers

33:35.247 --> 33:37.349
to get a better grip
on the ball, right?

33:37.349 --> 33:39.151
Which means they've been
basically eating the poison.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.686
Over and over again.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.255
I'm going to give you guys
an atropine injection.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.924
Should make you feel better.
Good enough to play tonight?

33:45.924 --> 33:48.927
It might take a few hours
for the atropine to kick in,

33:48.927 --> 33:50.529
but you should be fine.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.630
LAVON:
Whoo!

33:51.630 --> 33:55.467
Lavon Hayes is back
on track, baby! (chuckles)

34:03.375 --> 34:05.377
Gigi?

34:28.800 --> 34:30.469
Come to wish me luck?

34:30.469 --> 34:33.038
How dare you tell me
that you love me.

34:33.038 --> 34:34.739
Excuse me?
We are not children, Lavon.

34:34.739 --> 34:39.311
We can't just go around saying
everything that's on our mind,

34:39.311 --> 34:41.179
doing whatever we want,
acting reckless.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.447
I was just being honest.

34:42.447 --> 34:43.949
Don't be honest.
Be a grown-up.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.317
What constitutes
being a grown-up

34:45.317 --> 34:47.018
in your opinion?
It's easy.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.688
You keep your
feelings inside.
Control your urges.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.123
You do what's right even
though it feels wrong.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.757
So you admit
that it feels wrong.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.993
I am not getting sucked
down this rabbit hole
with you, Lavon.

34:54.993 --> 34:57.729
Just promise me you're gonna
stop acting crazy, okay?

34:57.729 --> 35:00.132
No more outbursts.
Just promise me, Lavon.

35:04.436 --> 35:08.106
We can keep our feelings
inside as long as you want to.

35:10.309 --> 35:13.245
Doesn't mean
they don't exist.

35:32.731 --> 35:35.634
(sobbing)

35:43.709 --> 35:45.611
you dyed your skin
our school colors.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.479
I mean, talk about
team spirit.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.348
JIMMY:
Oh, yeah, that's right.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.549
(people murmuring)

35:59.491 --> 36:01.360
ZOE:
There you are.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.230
I was too sick to go home.

36:04.230 --> 36:05.631
But don't worry,
I've checked

36:05.631 --> 36:08.234
into the Whippoorwill
Blossom Bed and Breakfast.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.602
The owner has six cats...

36:10.602 --> 36:11.603
(sneezes)

36:11.603 --> 36:14.240
...which as you know
I'm allergic to.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.408
So, now I'm nauseas,
green and sneezing.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.944
Atropine. Should help
with your stomach problem,

36:18.944 --> 36:22.147
although you're going
to have to find another
solution for the cats.

36:22.147 --> 36:23.782
Is this hysterical to you?

36:23.782 --> 36:26.718
No. You just remind me of
me when I first got here.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.787
But now you love
BlueBell, right?

36:28.787 --> 36:31.189
You want to marry it and have
its little redneck babies.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.691
I wouldn't say that,

36:32.691 --> 36:34.860
but I definitely don't
hate it as much as I used to.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.762
I guess I've changed,

36:36.762 --> 36:39.231
which is why this whole thing
isn't completely your fault.

36:39.231 --> 36:40.699
Do you think?

36:40.699 --> 36:42.133
You were right.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.202
I used to love
going out with you.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.272
Getting dressed up,
the trendy food,

36:46.272 --> 36:49.408
the occasional mocking of the
fashion challenged individuals.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.543
It was the best.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.679
But, I don't know, last
night it just didn't--

36:53.679 --> 36:55.381
it didn't feel
like me anymore.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.583
You defended a fanny pack.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.150
I know. That was weird.

36:59.150 --> 37:03.522
The truth is, I don't--
I don't think I fit in here,

37:03.522 --> 37:07.793
but I'm not sure that I fit
in New York anymore either.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.528
I'm kind of nowhere
at the moment,

37:09.528 --> 37:12.163
which is really scary,
but not your fault.

37:12.163 --> 37:15.367
I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.836
All is forgiven,
my little ladybug.

37:20.171 --> 37:22.040
And I'm sorry
I slept with your vet.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.344
That's really not okay.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.813
But I forgive you, too.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.616
Thanks for these.

37:30.616 --> 37:33.919
I'm going to check out, collect
my complimentary needlepoint

37:33.919 --> 37:35.787
and get on the next flight

37:35.787 --> 37:37.155
back to New York.

37:37.155 --> 37:39.925
Call me when you come back home.

37:51.202 --> 37:53.004
You gonna bring
your pom-poms tonight?

37:53.004 --> 37:57.543
Well, got to show my
school spirit, George.

37:57.543 --> 37:59.311
After all, I was
head cheerleader.

37:59.311 --> 38:01.613
Oh, you don't have
to remind me of that.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.182
First time I saw you
in that little outfit,

38:04.182 --> 38:05.617
I knew I had to marry you.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.686
You were always a sucker
for a short skirt.

38:10.489 --> 38:13.325
Look, I want you
to know that you...

38:13.325 --> 38:15.794
you don't have
to be everything for me.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.799
We don't need to talk
about it anymore.

38:20.799 --> 38:24.403
I may not ever be good enough
to deserve you, George Tucker,

38:24.403 --> 38:28.507
but I'm going to spend
my life trying.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.510
That's a promise.

38:41.453 --> 38:47.192
Hey, you, uh, going to the game?

38:47.192 --> 38:49.695
I can't. I've got some stuff
I have to do.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.697
Besides,
I'm pretty wiped out.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.732
Must have been some party.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.534
Did, uh,

38:55.534 --> 38:58.737
Judson show up?

38:58.737 --> 39:01.172
He did.

39:01.172 --> 39:04.109
Y'all hook up?

39:05.711 --> 39:07.813
What? It's just a question.

39:07.813 --> 39:10.549
Not that it's any of your
business, but no, we did not.

39:10.549 --> 39:13.752
I don't think Judson
and I were meant to be.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.654
Well, it's probably
for the best.

39:15.654 --> 39:17.523
I always thought
that guy was gay.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.938
LAVON:
Hello?

39:32.938 --> 39:34.072
(sighs)

39:39.511 --> 39:42.113
What... Is all this for me?

39:42.113 --> 39:44.249
I thought you could
invite some friends over

39:44.249 --> 39:46.251
to celebrate the big win.

39:46.251 --> 39:47.919
Congratulations, by the way.

39:47.919 --> 39:51.790
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.191
Oh.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.794
Is that crab dip?

39:55.794 --> 39:57.896
I bought extra.
It is a crowd pleaser,

39:57.896 --> 40:00.599
after all.
You didn't have
to do all this.

40:00.599 --> 40:03.201
I know, but I wanted to.

40:03.201 --> 40:06.304
You are a good
friend, Lavon.

40:06.304 --> 40:07.673
You're probably my best friend

40:07.673 --> 40:09.941
in the whole world
at the moment. No pressure.

40:11.910 --> 40:15.614
Well, as long as I don't
have to go shoe shopping,

40:15.614 --> 40:18.450
that's fine
with me.

40:18.450 --> 40:21.219
Wow.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.454
Hey.

40:22.454 --> 40:24.322
Hmm?
Do you have any more

40:24.322 --> 40:27.793
of those Zabar's garlic
toasty thingamajigs, would you?

40:27.793 --> 40:30.896
I'm sure I do. Why?

40:30.896 --> 40:34.666
Oh... Now imagine how good they
would taste with my crab dip.

40:36.635 --> 40:37.636
Ah, yeah!
Ah, yeah!

40:37.636 --> 40:39.838
(both laughing)

40:39.838 --> 40:41.106
Oh...

40:42.107 --> 40:44.042
Mmm.
That is good.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.044
That's pretty good.
That's quite tasty
right there.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.547
You gotta try some of the crab
dip that you love so much.

40:48.547 --> 40:49.815
I think so. Should we
go green, or what?

40:49.815 --> 40:51.883
Wait, let me see if I
can get this up there.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.418
Here we go.

40:53.418 --> 40:55.554
Oh! Passed to the fridge.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.255
Oh!
Oh!

40:57.255 --> 40:58.724
Yeah!
