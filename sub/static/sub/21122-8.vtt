00:00.083 --> 00:01.492
<i>Previously on "The Mist"...</i>

00:01.523 --> 00:03.703
- Hey!
- He tried to skip the rations

00:03.727 --> 00:05.148
and just eat whatever he wanted.

00:05.172 --> 00:07.078
We got two days worth of rations left.

00:07.148 --> 00:08.581
Take away food, take away water...

00:08.650 --> 00:10.416
that's when people
start doing bad things.

00:10.493 --> 00:13.394
Anyone who endangers the group
is thrown out!

00:13.455 --> 00:15.555
Fuck all of you!

00:15.624 --> 00:17.523
I want to be someone you can believe in.

00:17.592 --> 00:19.058
I'm gonna do rapid detox.

00:19.127 --> 00:20.526
I need your help.

00:20.595 --> 00:22.228
Do you know what a trial by ordeal is?

00:22.297 --> 00:24.063
We walk into the mist.

00:24.132 --> 00:27.700
Whoever dies, we will provide
an answer for the people here.

00:27.769 --> 00:29.936
They will know who to follow.

00:30.005 --> 00:31.738
Help!

00:34.609 --> 00:35.842
Mom, no!

00:35.910 --> 00:37.377
I told you to stay away from her!

00:37.445 --> 00:38.945
Mom, stop! He saved me.

00:39.014 --> 00:41.381
There are signs
of intercourse, but no violence.

00:41.449 --> 00:44.117
There are also traces
of triazolam in her blood.

00:44.185 --> 00:45.945
I want to find the boy
who raped my daughter.

00:45.987 --> 00:47.186
I want him to suffer,

00:47.255 --> 00:48.588
and then I want him to learn

00:48.657 --> 00:51.024
that there will be no salvation.

01:17.352 --> 01:18.951
We're lost.

01:19.020 --> 01:20.053
We're not lost.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.220
We're on Laurel.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.955
This is my neighborhood.

01:29.033 --> 01:30.129
Stop the car.

01:31.111 --> 01:32.131
Stop the car!

01:35.837 --> 01:38.285
- What?
- This is my street.

01:39.527 --> 01:40.606
I need to go.

01:42.043 --> 01:43.421
I need to check on them. I'm sorry.

01:43.445 --> 01:44.577
Adrian...

01:44.646 --> 01:47.280
I have to say goodbye.

01:47.445 --> 01:49.765
We're almost out of gas.

01:50.051 --> 01:52.202
- Your parents have a car?
- Yeah.

01:52.854 --> 01:54.134
I'll figure out the gas problem.

02:08.536 --> 02:09.869
It'll only be a second.

02:09.937 --> 02:11.337
I'll go with you.

02:11.417 --> 02:12.886
I'm fine.

02:13.058 --> 02:14.173
It's okay.

02:15.577 --> 02:16.943
I'll help you with the gas.

02:17.035 --> 02:18.535
I'll stay here with the car.

02:46.366 --> 02:49.333
Nathalie, tell us what's going on.

02:49.402 --> 02:52.069
When does the miracle happen?

02:53.339 --> 02:55.239
The Black Spring is the miracle.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.868
This is bullshit!

02:59.112 --> 03:01.618
When it happened back in 1860,

03:02.615 --> 03:04.916
it was because a young woman was abused,

03:05.509 --> 03:07.518
and now it has happened again.

03:08.383 --> 03:11.255
Nature took Mikhail, because
he had done awful things,

03:11.539 --> 03:13.424
things he went to prison for.

03:13.493 --> 03:16.185
Nature took Link
because of what he did to me.

03:17.599 --> 03:19.964
Nature took Romanov,
because he ordered Link.

03:20.638 --> 03:23.267
Every time, She spared me.

03:26.001 --> 03:28.439
Now think about that
before you question me again.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.112
I miss it.

03:35.336 --> 03:37.949
Are you going out there again?

03:38.711 --> 03:40.828
Soon...

03:41.226 --> 03:43.221
when I know what it wants me to do.

04:02.761 --> 04:04.271
You probably shouldn't touch me.

04:04.339 --> 04:05.977
Your mom will shoot off my hand.

04:07.198 --> 04:09.814
And even if it's burned,
I kind of like it.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.567
Any news on the western front?

04:17.646 --> 04:18.656
A ton of arguing

04:18.725 --> 04:22.250
about how they were
going to split rations.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.795
It's basically Gus and a calculator.

04:25.328 --> 04:29.984
He's starting to talk about
scavenger parties, expeditions.

04:30.503 --> 04:33.170
He's asking for volunteers.

04:34.874 --> 04:37.441
I imagine he wasn't successful.

04:39.182 --> 04:41.245
It's going to be bad.

04:41.713 --> 04:43.814
It already is bad.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.617
It's going to be a lot worse.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.458
What can I do?

04:54.779 --> 04:56.857
You can find me a room,

04:58.170 --> 05:00.031
one with no windows.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.013
Can I sit?

05:17.283 --> 05:19.050
Of course. Please, please.

05:37.605 --> 05:41.906
We were married here, Liza and I.

05:42.488 --> 05:43.874
Romanov married you?

05:45.311 --> 05:46.577
He did.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.213
He buried her, too.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.618
When he did, he told me.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.797
God listens to those
who call to Him with favor.

05:58.304 --> 05:59.741
It was church talk for,

05:59.785 --> 06:02.360
"It's your fault
for not praying hard enough."

06:04.797 --> 06:07.065
I'm glad he didn't come back with you.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.811
You walked through that door alone,

06:10.452 --> 06:12.350
and I felt...

06:12.705 --> 06:13.738
lighter.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.777
It must have been very hard for you.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.357
What?

06:24.751 --> 06:27.084
Raising a baby alone.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.926
My mother was not...

06:37.330 --> 06:38.729
She wasn't around...

06:40.867 --> 06:45.302
so I know how it is
to be raised by a dad who...

06:52.478 --> 06:54.979
It's the last thing
that I wanted for Jay.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.950
But that's what he got.

07:00.311 --> 07:04.567
I had no idea what I was doing.

07:05.411 --> 07:07.291
I don't know how to...

07:08.361 --> 07:10.161
talk about things

07:10.229 --> 07:14.432
or teach someone how to be,

07:14.500 --> 07:15.800
you know...

07:17.070 --> 07:18.169
a person.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.007
And I messed up...

07:24.610 --> 07:26.677
and I raised a boy who...

07:29.716 --> 07:30.981
What?

07:34.654 --> 07:36.520
I think he did it.

07:38.524 --> 07:41.392
I guess that, part of me
knew that first night,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.728
but when I went out there
for you in the mist,

07:43.796 --> 07:46.163
I could feel it in every part of me.

07:49.535 --> 07:52.036
I think that he raped that girl.

08:05.718 --> 08:06.884
Come.

08:17.697 --> 08:18.896
Hi, Dad.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.036
There's some food on the stove
if you want.

08:31.277 --> 08:32.876
Where's Mom?

08:35.914 --> 08:37.248
In the living room.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.722
On the third day after the mist came,

09:17.056 --> 09:18.956
she couldn't sleep.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.482
She was so afraid.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.361
I woke up, and she
was standing on the stoop.

09:24.430 --> 09:25.796
They already got her.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.666
Who?

09:28.990 --> 09:32.469
Birds, huge flocks of them.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.439
Got the gun when I heard her scream,

09:35.508 --> 09:36.509
but I was too late.

09:45.107 --> 09:47.207
God, iit's all my fault.

09:49.263 --> 09:50.762
I made him what he is.

09:50.839 --> 09:52.339
You're a good man.

09:52.407 --> 09:53.840
No, I'm not.

09:56.745 --> 09:58.812
I lost him the minute I lost her.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.917
How do people get through the loss?

10:04.307 --> 10:06.186
How are you getting over Benedict?

10:12.194 --> 10:15.695
Did you know that the trails
that airplanes leave in the sky

10:15.764 --> 10:19.532
contain biohazardous toxic waste
from hospitals?

10:21.169 --> 10:23.805
So many horrible things in the world.

10:24.473 --> 10:26.339
Just awful.

10:27.951 --> 10:30.744
Bad people, bad, bad people

10:30.812 --> 10:33.179
hurting the very thing
that gives us life.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.650
And now Mother Nature has had enough.

10:42.524 --> 10:44.691
I don't know what to do.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.229
Yes, you do.

10:51.032 --> 10:53.032
You're blinded by society,

10:53.101 --> 10:55.001
but deep down, you know.

10:55.070 --> 10:57.737
You know, and it's not your fault.

10:59.474 --> 11:02.375
You just need to open your eyes.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.743
Tell me how to open them.

11:04.466 --> 11:05.879
Feel your purpose.

11:06.326 --> 11:08.681
- I don't know what my purpose is.
- Yes, you do.

11:12.032 --> 11:14.099
Tell me what my purpose is.

11:14.168 --> 11:16.268
You must feel it yourself.
Trust your instincts.

11:16.337 --> 11:17.777
I don't think that I have instincts.

11:17.838 --> 11:19.137
They're better than you think.

11:19.206 --> 11:20.806
I don't think that I have a purpose.

11:20.874 --> 11:23.475
Everything in nature
has a purpose, even violence.

11:24.611 --> 11:26.545
Animals kill to survive.

11:26.613 --> 11:27.879
They don't kill for pleasure.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.548
Only humans do that,

11:29.616 --> 11:32.951
and when they do, they trespass
against Nature's order.

11:34.888 --> 11:37.856
That is why the Black Spring is here.

11:39.768 --> 11:42.802
It is here to take the trespassers.

11:57.954 --> 11:59.177
Jay?

12:06.120 --> 12:08.820
My purpose is to restore order.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.256
It always was.

12:11.716 --> 12:13.892
You were just following the wrong law.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.224
Hey.

13:28.435 --> 13:29.935
Does it suit me?

13:31.305 --> 13:32.337
So beautiful.

13:34.039 --> 13:35.297
Come here.

14:07.974 --> 14:09.441
My gosh.

14:17.284 --> 14:18.850
I'm coming for you.

14:23.023 --> 14:25.323
You okay?

14:25.392 --> 14:27.425
Yeah. Good thing I went
with the bigger helmet.

14:28.762 --> 14:30.695
Wait. Let me get to you.

14:30.764 --> 14:32.531
I'm good. I'm fine.

14:32.599 --> 14:34.966
- You're good?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

14:35.035 --> 14:36.167
Okay.

15:14.942 --> 15:17.008
Did you ever want to live like that?

15:18.245 --> 15:20.011
Like what?

15:20.080 --> 15:23.748
You know, garden furniture, barbecue,

15:23.817 --> 15:26.518
Christmas lights?

15:27.097 --> 15:29.688
I don't remember, remember?

15:31.158 --> 15:33.391
Yeah, but what does your gut tell you?

15:34.962 --> 15:39.617
Sounds kind of nice, don't you think?

15:40.334 --> 15:41.933
No.

16:35.573 --> 16:38.073
I think the bank
of restaurants is closer.

16:38.358 --> 16:39.758
Still half a mile.

16:39.826 --> 16:41.393
But without power for the last week,

16:41.461 --> 16:43.272
I don't think there
will really be enough good food

16:43.296 --> 16:44.929
to make it worth it,

16:45.373 --> 16:47.732
so maybe Pricemart's gotta be our spot.

16:47.801 --> 16:49.300
It could already be raided.

16:49.529 --> 16:51.302
Do you know what she's doing right now?

16:51.371 --> 16:53.338
- Who?
- You know who, Alex.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.940
What is she doing, Shelley?

16:56.009 --> 16:58.534
She's making out with the boy
she accused of raping her.

16:58.622 --> 16:59.888
Jesus!

16:59.971 --> 17:01.224
It's really none of our business.

17:01.248 --> 17:03.148
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.387
Look, I don't know
what it's like to lose a child,

17:07.457 --> 17:09.442
but what happened
could have happened to anyone.

17:09.503 --> 17:10.434
Are you saying...

17:10.481 --> 17:12.616
I'm saying
what you're doing is dangerous.

17:12.693 --> 17:13.696
You need to stop.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.133
Let her talk, at least.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.834
She was in there with my daughter.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.869
She was there, and she did nothing,

17:18.938 --> 17:21.606
and I watched her walk out
of the mist without a scratch.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.441
You don't think that's weird?

17:23.510 --> 17:24.776
I think it's crazy talk.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.644
Hey, the woman lost her daughter.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.114
I don't need her gaslighting
people into hysteria.

17:29.183 --> 17:31.917
The grieving woman is hysterical?

17:31.986 --> 17:33.619
That's how you're playing this?

17:35.798 --> 17:37.548
She has a point.

17:40.261 --> 17:42.895
I'm just trying to keep my mall safe.

17:45.633 --> 17:47.933
It's not your mall, mister.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.411
Where have you guys been?

18:00.981 --> 18:02.166
Just skating.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.184
Your mom's been looking for you.

18:05.510 --> 18:07.085
Of course she has.

18:07.995 --> 18:09.555
You know, it's not a bad thing

18:09.612 --> 18:11.790
to have a mom
that gives a shit about you.

18:14.228 --> 18:17.963
We need some water
from the storage locker.

18:18.032 --> 18:19.965
Ground floor, under the service hallway?

18:20.034 --> 18:21.960
Do you think you can help with that?

18:22.570 --> 18:24.136
Yeah, of course.

18:24.205 --> 18:26.171
Great.

19:10.351 --> 19:12.484
Hey! Hey!

19:14.221 --> 19:15.387
Open the door!

19:18.125 --> 19:19.710
Let me out!

19:19.749 --> 19:22.727
You really think
I'd let you keep doing this?

19:23.063 --> 19:24.830
That I'd let you hurt her again?

19:24.899 --> 19:26.965
Open the door!

19:27.034 --> 19:28.567
You can't do this!

19:31.271 --> 19:32.537
Watch me.

19:32.648 --> 19:33.739
Eve?!

19:35.140 --> 19:36.975
Eve! Eve!

19:37.044 --> 19:38.044
Let me out!

19:39.480 --> 19:40.675
Come back!

19:48.236 --> 19:50.003
I bet you haven't even cried.

19:50.970 --> 19:53.673
Your mother had the biggest
heart you could ever imagine.

19:53.742 --> 19:55.575
I've cried every day.

19:55.644 --> 19:57.010
You don't know how to do that.

19:57.078 --> 19:58.344
Of course I do.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.781
You never loved me.

20:03.919 --> 20:05.151
That is true.

20:05.220 --> 20:07.487
And if I can love, I guess that means

20:07.555 --> 20:10.056
there's something wrong
with you, not me.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.891
A dad is supposed to love his son!

20:11.960 --> 20:13.393
A man is supposed to love women.

20:13.461 --> 20:15.328
I guess we're both messed up.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.700
At least we don't have
to lie to each other anymore.

20:26.614 --> 20:28.247
The time has come to leave.

20:28.617 --> 20:30.677
I know now what it wants me to do.

20:30.745 --> 20:31.815
What?

20:31.888 --> 20:34.722
Connor has confessed
a terrible secret to me.

20:35.150 --> 20:37.517
His son is guilty
of molesting the Copeland girl.

20:38.150 --> 20:40.665
The last message he had from him
was from the mall.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.183
That is where we must go.

20:42.424 --> 20:43.823
Why?

20:44.259 --> 20:46.092
For us to offer those who trespass

20:46.161 --> 20:48.251
against the natural order of things.

20:48.563 --> 20:52.814
Only after the disease is purged
will it move away from here

20:52.982 --> 20:54.481
and leave us in peace,

20:54.636 --> 20:56.703
in harmony with each other once again.

20:56.771 --> 20:57.804
I don't understand.

20:57.872 --> 20:59.339
Isn't that just more violence?

20:59.407 --> 21:01.040
It is purposeful violence.

21:01.109 --> 21:02.675
What's the difference?

21:02.744 --> 21:06.079
Every act of destruction
is an act of creation.

21:06.709 --> 21:08.514
Why Jay?

21:08.583 --> 21:11.084
He raped that girl. He's the catalyst,

21:11.152 --> 21:12.585
just like in 1860.

21:12.654 --> 21:14.033
How do you know?

21:14.135 --> 21:16.602
She's been right
about everything else so far.

21:16.725 --> 21:18.592
Where is Father Romanov's God?

21:23.510 --> 21:24.564
We're good.

21:26.134 --> 21:28.034
I found a way.

21:30.105 --> 21:31.838
Come with us.

21:32.229 --> 21:34.207
Help us restore order.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.620
Wait. Wait, help!

21:51.626 --> 21:53.559
Please, please let me in!

21:53.628 --> 21:56.729
- Are you armed?
- No, I won't hurt you!

21:56.798 --> 21:58.297
I know you. You're Mr. Copeland!

21:58.366 --> 21:59.298
- Who are you?
- I'm Vic.

21:59.367 --> 22:00.666
I work at the game store!

22:00.735 --> 22:02.869
Please, just let me in! I know Alex!

22:02.937 --> 22:03.803
- You've seen her?
- Of course.

22:03.872 --> 22:05.438
I just came from the mall.

22:05.507 --> 22:07.227
I'll tell you all about it
if you let me in!

22:25.193 --> 22:27.326
Did you see Jay come back?

22:28.638 --> 22:30.538
No. Why?

22:31.900 --> 22:33.433
He just went to get water.

22:33.501 --> 22:35.768
It's been like a halfhour.

22:35.837 --> 22:38.806
He's probably just using
the bathroom or something.

22:39.707 --> 22:42.824
I think I'm gonna
go walk around for a sec,

22:42.886 --> 22:44.610
see if I can find him.

22:44.679 --> 22:46.012
Why don't you wait for your mom?

22:47.749 --> 22:49.182
It's okay. I'll be back.

23:15.243 --> 23:16.642
Alex, what are you doing here?

23:16.711 --> 23:19.212
I'm looking for Jay. Have you seen him?

23:19.280 --> 23:20.971
No, not since last night.

23:21.042 --> 23:22.849
Why don't you just stay away from him?

23:22.917 --> 23:24.884
- Shelley...
- I mean,

23:24.953 --> 23:27.386
girls usually don't go
on play dates with their rapist.

23:29.424 --> 23:30.518
Thanks for your help.

23:30.579 --> 23:32.822
Unless there's
something wrong with the girl,

23:33.061 --> 23:35.428
unless it's the girl
that the mist wouldn't touch.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.930
I didn't ask for your opinion.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.233
Too bad. I'm giving it to you.

23:40.301 --> 23:42.702
Hey, come on, man.

23:42.770 --> 23:44.203
Don't touch her.

23:44.272 --> 23:45.382
Why are you immune to the mist, Alex?

23:45.406 --> 23:46.839
Why didn't it want you?

23:46.908 --> 23:48.708
Shelley, we've got lots of work to do.

23:48.776 --> 23:50.042
Let it be.

24:03.758 --> 24:05.424
- Is Alex okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

24:05.493 --> 24:07.260
She's okay. She survived.

24:07.328 --> 24:09.580
- Is she hurt?
- No, no, not yet.

24:09.642 --> 24:11.063
What does that mean?

24:15.403 --> 24:16.769
They are freaking out over there.

24:16.838 --> 24:18.671
They're going all "The Last Stand."

24:18.740 --> 24:20.384
What is that? I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:20.408 --> 24:21.986
It's this game where you
have to defend yourself

24:22.010 --> 24:23.220
from zombies and other survivors,

24:23.244 --> 24:24.347
everyone turning against each other.

24:24.371 --> 24:26.779
- Jesus.
- I only survived by house hopping.

24:26.848 --> 24:27.980
So where are we going?

24:28.049 --> 24:30.850
I'm waiting for my friends,
and then we're going to the mall.

24:30.911 --> 24:32.777
Great.

24:42.403 --> 24:44.170
That was fun.

24:45.773 --> 24:47.406
That, it was.

24:49.077 --> 24:51.077
Can't remember having sex before,

24:51.145 --> 24:53.246
but I'm pretty sure this was good.

24:53.314 --> 24:55.014
You did okay.

24:56.851 --> 24:59.285
Felt like it wasn't your first time.

25:01.155 --> 25:03.380
I wonder if I have a wife somewhere.

25:03.791 --> 25:06.425
I mean, I don't miss her if I do,

25:06.494 --> 25:08.361
which is just extra weird.

25:10.498 --> 25:11.964
Maybe they know at Arrowhead.

25:13.701 --> 25:15.902
If I took out some dude
who wanted to kill me,

25:15.970 --> 25:18.804
then I guess I shouldn't
go back there right now.

25:25.246 --> 25:31.117
Did you, um,
have somebody before all this?

25:32.854 --> 25:34.120
No.

25:35.741 --> 25:36.822
We should go.

25:36.891 --> 25:38.291
They're waiting.

25:53.174 --> 25:54.174
Come in.

25:56.744 --> 25:59.178
Wes, what can I do for you?

25:59.247 --> 26:00.813
Come up with a food plan?

26:00.882 --> 26:03.149
I'm working on
the least dangerous scenario.

26:03.217 --> 26:05.084
Just haven't come up with it yet.

26:13.361 --> 26:14.994
We'll be okay, son.

26:19.849 --> 26:21.616
Look, I'm a soldier, okay?

26:21.669 --> 26:23.347
When people talk
about help coming their way,

26:23.371 --> 26:24.870
they're talking about me.

26:24.939 --> 26:26.339
Help would have come by now.

26:28.009 --> 26:30.210
Everyone's just barely
hanging on out there.

26:30.327 --> 26:31.377
I know.

26:31.446 --> 26:33.491
We need to do something.

26:33.581 --> 26:35.014
I told you I'm looking into it.

26:35.083 --> 26:36.983
No. About that woman, about Shelley.

26:37.051 --> 26:38.884
I mean, it's dry grass down there.

26:38.953 --> 26:40.608
She's a lit match, and people
are starting to believe her.

26:40.632 --> 26:42.131
What is she saying now?

26:42.200 --> 26:45.201
She says that the only reason
Alex survived the mist

26:45.270 --> 26:48.104
is because she's a part of it,
that they're connected.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.682
Jesus.

26:49.974 --> 26:51.274
This is nuts.

26:51.342 --> 26:54.002
We have one day of food left,

26:54.245 --> 26:55.878
and they're ready to believe anything.

26:58.149 --> 27:00.149
I'll see what I can do.

27:36.230 --> 27:38.030
Who's that out there?

27:38.154 --> 27:39.553
It's Alex's dad.

27:42.026 --> 27:44.694
Yeah? Did he give it to you, too?

27:44.763 --> 27:47.235
He always seemed
a little light in his shoes.

27:47.425 --> 27:49.091
You're disgusting.

27:52.953 --> 27:55.683
They are more of a family to me
than you ever were.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.375
Not that that's hard
with a psycho like you.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.284
You know Mom was afraid of you, right?

28:11.222 --> 28:12.755
She was afraid of you.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.690
She thought she loved you, I'm sure.

28:14.759 --> 28:16.225
She didn't.

28:16.294 --> 28:19.195
Her heart was too big
to admit it, but she knew.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.565
She knew what?

28:25.069 --> 28:26.369
You're a monster.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.506
Not the cocksucking, though.
She was okay with that.

28:30.575 --> 28:32.008
Hell, even I could have been okay

28:32.076 --> 28:33.716
if you'd only been
just right in the head.

28:33.778 --> 28:35.244
You're lying.

28:35.313 --> 28:36.679
All those pills that she took,

28:36.748 --> 28:38.058
she couldn't stand to be around you.

28:38.082 --> 28:39.749
Stop saying that!

28:41.319 --> 28:42.885
I know what you said to her.

28:42.954 --> 28:44.687
I know what you called her. She told me.

28:44.756 --> 28:46.805
She wouldn't leave you.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.691
I wasn't gonna let her be a victim.

28:48.765 --> 28:50.927
Yeah. You're messed up, all right,

28:50.995 --> 28:52.929
and that's why
she finally went out there.

28:53.005 --> 28:54.805
That's why she was so scared that night.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.299
She loved me!

28:56.367 --> 28:58.655
No one could love you,

28:58.851 --> 28:59.969
not the real you!

29:00.374 --> 29:01.771
Alex loves me.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.840
Until she finds someone
that could fuck her!

29:12.116 --> 29:13.282
I did!

29:15.887 --> 29:18.588
I... I had to.

29:18.715 --> 29:22.902
I wasn't gonna let her
choose someone like Jay.

29:23.161 --> 29:24.794
It's okay.

29:26.480 --> 29:28.097
She loves me.

29:28.609 --> 29:30.466
Mom loves me.

29:33.841 --> 29:36.241
You... You love me.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.815
You love me.

30:09.340 --> 30:10.273
Who the hell is this?

30:10.341 --> 30:12.608
I'm Vic. Cool dolphin.

30:12.677 --> 30:14.443
I like him. He can stay.

30:14.512 --> 30:17.213
Vic says there's trouble
at the mall. We're going.

30:17.282 --> 30:19.073
Yeah, but where's Adrian?

30:19.884 --> 30:20.884
He's still in there.

30:42.629 --> 30:43.673
Shit!

30:47.187 --> 30:48.918
Jesus, Adrian, what happened?

30:48.980 --> 30:52.615
He... He tried... He tried to kill me.

30:58.753 --> 31:00.815
Adrian, it's okay.

31:05.664 --> 31:07.464
He went crazy.

31:07.564 --> 31:08.778
He went nuts.

31:08.841 --> 31:11.669
Adrian, come here. Come here. Come here.

31:11.732 --> 31:13.575
All right, hold that on.

31:13.643 --> 31:16.411
He wasn't in his right mind, all right?

31:16.479 --> 31:17.745
I'm just...

31:17.822 --> 31:19.492
I'm sorry. I should have come
with you no matter what.

31:19.516 --> 31:22.750
- I have no one now.
- No, no, no, no.

31:22.819 --> 31:24.819
Adrian, Adrian, you have us.

31:24.888 --> 31:27.956
You have us. You'll always
have us, all right?

31:29.367 --> 31:31.167
You'll always be part of our family.

31:33.279 --> 31:35.597
Okay, let me see that. Let me see this.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.133
You need antiseptic or something, okay?

31:39.202 --> 31:40.446
Where do you keep your medicine?

31:40.470 --> 31:43.296
- Bathroom.
- Okay. All right.

31:43.350 --> 31:44.572
All right.

31:55.085 --> 31:56.484
Hey, sit down.

31:57.721 --> 31:58.987
Thank you.

31:59.055 --> 32:01.322
Of course. We need... I need iodine.

32:01.391 --> 32:04.125
There should be some
up there, top shelf.

32:04.194 --> 32:06.427
- Maybe just some BandAids.
- No, no, no.

32:06.496 --> 32:08.830
I'm not taking any chances
with this. Let me see it.

32:12.135 --> 32:13.601
Yeah, okay.

32:17.210 --> 32:18.265
All right.

32:19.576 --> 32:22.792
Hey, don't worry.

32:22.946 --> 32:24.879
DDo you promise?

32:24.948 --> 32:27.940
What? Do I promise what?

32:28.184 --> 32:33.306
That I'll always be a part
of your family, no matter what?

32:36.793 --> 32:38.026
I promise.

32:44.098 --> 32:48.153
Even if I did something stupid?

32:48.305 --> 32:50.204
Adrian, don't worry.

32:50.273 --> 32:53.174
I'm not gonna leave you, okay?

32:59.082 --> 33:01.039
All right. Let's see if they
have anything else.

33:09.225 --> 33:11.492
Why do you have...

33:15.065 --> 33:17.732
I just didn't want to be alone.

33:17.801 --> 33:18.833
What?

33:20.686 --> 33:21.785
What did you say?

33:21.972 --> 33:24.105
I couldn't lose her.

33:24.174 --> 33:28.042
She's the only one
who loves me. I'm sorry.

33:30.347 --> 33:31.512
Adrian.

33:32.134 --> 33:34.449
Adrian, what did you do?

33:34.517 --> 33:37.318
What did you do? What did you do?

33:37.387 --> 33:38.686
What have you done?!

33:38.755 --> 33:40.254
You said. You said I would always be

33:40.323 --> 33:44.545
a part of your family, no matter what!

33:45.061 --> 33:46.694
You're hurting me!

33:55.872 --> 33:58.479
Jay was gonna take her away from me.

33:58.549 --> 33:59.907
- Adrian.
- Stay!

34:04.314 --> 34:05.613
You need help, Adrian.

34:07.217 --> 34:09.083
Don't say that.

34:10.353 --> 34:13.654
I'm not sick. I'm not a freak.

34:13.723 --> 34:16.690
You... You said...
You said I would always be

34:16.760 --> 34:18.817
a part of your family, no matter what.

34:18.887 --> 34:21.929
- You will.
- But you're just like everyone else.

34:21.998 --> 34:24.931
No, Adrian. No.

34:25.001 --> 34:26.601
Get down on your knees.

34:26.668 --> 34:27.668
Adrian.

34:27.704 --> 34:29.504
Get down!

34:29.895 --> 34:32.751
Okay. Okay. All right.

34:32.848 --> 34:34.942
I'm getting down.

34:35.011 --> 34:37.578
I'm on my knees, Adrian.
I'm on my knees.

34:37.647 --> 34:39.614
I love her.

34:39.681 --> 34:41.416
I'll protect her.

34:41.562 --> 34:43.562
I'll protect both of them.

34:44.768 --> 34:47.088
Adrian, Adrian, please. Please don't.

34:47.157 --> 34:48.623
I'm sorry.

34:50.326 --> 34:52.326
Adrian, please.

35:05.075 --> 35:06.808
Adrian, what happened?

35:06.876 --> 35:08.476
- Where's Kevin?
- Adrian, where's Kevin?

35:08.501 --> 35:09.520
He... He's...

35:09.560 --> 35:10.778
Adrian, you need to calm down.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.680
You need to tell me where he is.

35:12.749 --> 35:15.036
He's dead!

35:17.487 --> 35:19.520
No, no, no.

35:22.459 --> 35:24.192
My dad killed him.

35:24.397 --> 35:25.493
Are you sure?

35:26.728 --> 35:28.906
He shot him in the... in the face.

35:28.983 --> 35:31.038
I tried.

35:31.267 --> 35:32.320
I tried...

35:34.210 --> 35:35.376
What do we do?

35:35.538 --> 35:37.138
We go to the mall.

35:37.207 --> 35:39.340
Why? It was Kevin
who wanted to go there.

35:39.750 --> 35:41.509
Let's just...

35:41.750 --> 35:44.979
- Let's just get the fuck out of here.
- No. No! No!

35:47.016 --> 35:48.098
I promised him.

35:48.176 --> 35:50.451
I promised him I would protect them.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.553
I promised him I would keep them safe.

36:19.616 --> 36:21.616
Did you ever have kids?

36:22.200 --> 36:23.926
Not that I know of.

36:25.088 --> 36:26.088
There's nothing on earth

36:26.122 --> 36:27.522
that makes you feel so big

36:27.590 --> 36:30.591
and so inadequate all at the same time.

36:33.463 --> 36:36.230
I know that Alex
had nothing to do with the mist.

36:38.301 --> 36:42.037
I just couldn't take seeing her alive,

36:42.639 --> 36:44.605
happy even.

36:48.003 --> 36:49.936
It was you who set the fire.

36:53.049 --> 36:56.551
Jesus, Shelley,
you gotta stop this craziness.

36:56.619 --> 36:58.419
They're starting to believe you.

37:00.390 --> 37:02.957
You have to confess,
or I'll do it for you.

37:04.194 --> 37:05.853
I wanted to,

37:06.129 --> 37:08.587
so I went to your office to talk to you.

37:09.988 --> 37:10.998
I...

37:11.067 --> 37:13.267
Imagine my surprise
when I found food there.

37:15.082 --> 37:16.637
You had no business in that office.

37:16.706 --> 37:18.106
What do you think they're gonna say

37:18.174 --> 37:19.941
when they know you have your own supply?

37:20.009 --> 37:21.976
I'm trying my best here.

37:22.045 --> 37:23.844
I do nothing but help.

37:23.913 --> 37:25.913
You've been ready
to send people out for food

37:25.982 --> 37:26.914
when we have plenty.

37:26.983 --> 37:29.574
Well, someone has to lead.

37:29.886 --> 37:32.320
We... It's important that I'm alive.

37:32.388 --> 37:34.520
It's for everyone's safety.

37:35.024 --> 37:37.258
Guess we're both crazy.

37:40.557 --> 37:42.257
Will you confess?

37:44.867 --> 37:46.430
I...

37:46.669 --> 37:47.669
No.

37:47.737 --> 37:49.003
N... Shelley.

37:49.072 --> 37:50.896
Or you want me to do it for you?

37:54.381 --> 37:56.815
No, no, SShelley, please. Wait.

37:56.928 --> 37:58.012
No, no. No.

38:00.550 --> 38:01.550
Let go of me!

38:01.584 --> 38:03.317
It's for everyone's safety.

38:03.386 --> 38:04.885
Sure we'll find a way to manage,

38:04.943 --> 38:07.521
even after you've been thrown out.

38:33.093 --> 38:34.659
Go be with your daughter.

38:56.673 --> 38:58.437
Are you ready?

38:59.008 --> 39:00.041
I think...

39:00.109 --> 39:01.709
You want to stay behind.

39:05.782 --> 39:07.302
And the others?

39:07.528 --> 39:09.061
They were afraid to tell you.

39:09.185 --> 39:11.385
They didn't want to disappoint you.

39:12.922 --> 39:14.388
It's not that we don't believe you.

39:14.457 --> 39:17.667
We just... It's safer here.

39:17.927 --> 39:20.042
We want to wait and see.

39:20.563 --> 39:22.096
I understand.

39:23.433 --> 39:25.099
You do?

39:32.875 --> 39:34.075
Thank you.

39:35.278 --> 39:37.044
May She bless you.

39:46.322 --> 39:47.588
Where are they?

39:47.657 --> 39:50.189
They want to stay. They're ashamed.

39:50.807 --> 39:52.960
It really is a beautiful place.

40:00.870 --> 40:02.470
Are you ready?

40:05.641 --> 40:06.807
Yes.

40:30.366 --> 40:33.354
Every act of destruction
is an act of creation.

41:34.746 --> 41:36.579
Help!

41:36.961 --> 41:38.260
Help!

41:39.170 --> 41:40.910
Help!

41:40.978 --> 41:43.879
- What happened?
- I... I found her like this.

41:55.326 --> 41:56.725
You did this!

41:56.794 --> 41:58.194
No, no, no! Wait! Wait!

41:59.797 --> 42:01.416
- I heard you earlier!
- Wait, wait, wait!

42:01.440 --> 42:03.432
- You fought with her!
- Wait! No, wait!

42:03.501 --> 42:05.901
Who else would do this? Who else?

42:11.776 --> 42:12.809
Alex.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.544
Ilt was Alex.

42:15.613 --> 42:18.051
I saw her running away from here.

42:18.897 --> 42:21.330
Shelley must have been onto something.

42:21.780 --> 42:23.527
It was Alex.
