(tires screech)
(car door opens)

00:07.549 --> 00:09.676
(engine turns off)

00:09.718 --> 00:11.261
(car door closes)

00:11.302 --> 00:13.013
So, we wounded the Aglaeca.

00:13.054 --> 00:15.265
With sand from
our portent.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.475
How did the sand turn
into the seaweed wreath?

00:17.517 --> 00:19.352
I bet it was because I was
the last one who touched it,

00:19.394 --> 00:21.146
and the wreath
was my portent.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.231
The point is, we found
the Aglaeca's kryptonite.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.233
'Cause each of the portents
represented parts of her death:

00:25.275 --> 00:27.819
the seaweed that choked her,
the water that drowned her.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.320
What if we use more of the sand

00:29.362 --> 00:31.281
to finish her off
before she kills us?

00:31.322 --> 00:32.741
We're all out of sand.

00:32.782 --> 00:33.908
We lost it all when she exploded

00:33.950 --> 00:35.035
the dybbuk box.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.370
(exhales)

00:37.412 --> 00:39.998
The sun's about to rise.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.499
We officially have
one more day

00:41.541 --> 00:42.959
before our death
visions come true.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.961
No. I know where
to find more sand.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.254
Meet here in two hours.

00:46.296 --> 00:47.756
We'll divvy up the new batch

00:47.797 --> 00:49.466
and put an end to the Aglaeca.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.259
Well, how do we lure her
into the open?

00:51.301 --> 00:53.928
(exhales)
We use ourselves as bait.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.056
♪ ♪

01:03.313 --> 01:05.857
♪ ♪

01:14.199 --> 01:15.992
What? You're kidding.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.327
I put the seaweed wreath
in here.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.995
There should be sand in here.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.748
BESS: No, I, uh... I
feng shui'd the space.

01:21.790 --> 01:22.999
You what?

01:23.041 --> 01:24.501
(exhales)

01:24.542 --> 01:26.836
Oh, I threw it out.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.381
Nancy...
(stammers)

01:30.423 --> 01:32.133
Wait. Hold on.
How-how was I supposed to know

01:32.175 --> 01:33.885
we were gonna need it?

01:33.927 --> 01:35.386
(stammers)
No, it's fine.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.930
No. Listen.
No, it's okay.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.307
My chi felt
so balanced afterward.
It's okay.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.605
(scoffs)
You kidding me?

01:45.647 --> 01:48.108
Of course. The one time a year
Mom decides to vacuum.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.776
What are you looking for?

01:49.818 --> 01:51.277
A lifeline.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.946
Okay, breakfast time, guys.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.322
Get your foot.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.825
Jesse, did you...

01:56.866 --> 01:58.034
cook?

01:58.993 --> 02:00.411
Yeah.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.955
It's probably not
very good though.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.581
(exhales)

02:03.623 --> 02:05.333
'Kay, one of those
is for George, okay?

02:05.375 --> 02:07.377
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
But I'm...

02:07.418 --> 02:09.254
'Kay, everybody
gets one, guys! Stop!
Charlie, that's mine!

02:09.295 --> 02:10.880
Don't make George
be the octopus!

02:13.091 --> 02:14.676
Sorry.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.178
What do you mean
by "octopus"?

02:17.220 --> 02:19.430
An octopus cares for its eggs

02:19.472 --> 02:21.349
for 53 months,
and then once...

02:21.391 --> 02:22.892
And then nothing.
It's good and it's happy.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.978
Jesse has a vision,
and we're gonna make it happen.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.730
Right, guys? You know,
I actually don't even remember

02:27.772 --> 02:30.024
the last time
we had breakfast together.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.652
This...
is awesome.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.238
(snorts, chuckles)
What is wrong with you?

02:35.280 --> 02:38.116
(chuckles)
Does having a boyfriend
make you mushy?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.742
Okay, guys, the toast
is getting cold.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.327
Okay, just shut up
and eat your food.

02:41.369 --> 02:42.829
The bus
is almost here.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.998
Oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Breakfast selfie?

02:45.039 --> 02:47.375
Please?
Take a picture.
Okay.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.378
Come on!
Everybody get close.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.963
'Kay, we better
eat these.
(giggles)

02:52.005 --> 02:53.965
It would mean so much.
Quickly.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.592
Come on,
come on, come on.
Mm.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.801
(camera clicks)

02:56.843 --> 02:58.678
(giggles)
(whispers): Thank you.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.763
Here. You happy?
Yeah.

03:00.805 --> 03:04.267
Can I, uh, get another battery,
please?

03:06.477 --> 03:08.104
Ace.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.315
Can-can you stop playing
with your phone for a second?

03:11.399 --> 03:14.694
I'm looking at AJ Crane's death
photo on a 4chan chat board.

03:15.653 --> 03:18.031
Eyewitness got a photo

03:18.072 --> 03:19.782
right after the weathervane
impaled him.

03:19.824 --> 03:22.535
There's a bunch of comments
about what this shadow is

03:22.577 --> 03:24.078
in the woods
behind his body.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.371
Whoa.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.664
ACE:
Looks like the Aglaeca comes

03:26.706 --> 03:28.625
to personally claim her victims.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.127
Think she can be
in four places at once?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.671
Not...

03:33.713 --> 03:35.548
not likely.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.843
So then she comes for you

03:38.885 --> 03:40.511
one by one?

03:40.553 --> 03:42.347
I'd been picturing,
like, a...

03:42.388 --> 03:46.309
totally simultaneous
-style group event.

03:46.351 --> 03:50.146
And that means we got
five shots to take her out.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.360
And one of us is gonna be first.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.991
Hope we found enough
portent sand to split five ways.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.702
We have no sand.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.704
I checked my house,
the office, the cooler.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.915
And our kitchen has weirdly
never been so clean.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.458
Yeah, there's nothing
in my truck either.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.542
NANCY:
What about the
Marvin mansion?

04:11.584 --> 04:12.877
ACE:
No dice.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.879
Unfortunately,
someone hired a cleanup crew

04:14.921 --> 04:16.547
the day after Owen died.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.800
Hmm. Seems like someone let
a cleaning fairy on the loose.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.302
Okay, I'm sorry. It was me.
I'm sorry.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.554
I-I was just trying
to balance our chi, you know?

04:23.596 --> 04:25.139
And I was just
trying to help.
You know how you can help?

04:25.181 --> 04:26.599
Stop wallowing
in self-pity.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.309
Self-pity?
(scoffs)

04:28.351 --> 04:30.561
At least I'm not St. George,
the martyr.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.230
You know, you're always
talking about your family

04:32.272 --> 04:33.815
a burden,

04:33.856 --> 04:35.400
when the rest
of us would kill

04:35.441 --> 04:37.235
to have something
like that!
O-Okay, okay.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.695
You don't have to snap at her.
ACE:
That was a re-snap.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.363
You can't snap a re-snap.
George snapped first.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.532
Okay, guys, stop. We cannot
fall apart right now.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.409
Nobody's falling apart.
I'm just being transparent.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.618
GEORGE:
Says the guy
who spied on us

04:45.660 --> 04:47.245
for the cops.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.373
Wait, wait, why did you have
to work for McGinnis again?

04:50.415 --> 04:52.208
Ace had to stay out of jail
because he hacked into

04:52.250 --> 04:54.127
a federal database!

04:54.168 --> 04:56.212
Although you never did
tell me why you did that.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.589
He doesn't owe us an
explanation, so just drop it.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.508
Oh. (chuckles)
Of course

05:00.550 --> 05:01.592
she would say that.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.011
What's that supposed to mean?

05:03.052 --> 05:04.470
It means
you think silence is healthy.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.763
It means you operate

05:05.805 --> 05:07.473
on a need-to-know basis.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.058
I operate?
Yeah, yeah.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.060
As opposed to interact
authentically with other people

05:11.102 --> 05:13.479
as equals and not use us

05:13.521 --> 05:15.273
as-as tools in your missions

05:15.315 --> 05:16.607
and distractions
for your pain.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.900
Nick, my mom had just died.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.068
Wait, what are
we talking about now?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.445
This is
irrelevant!

05:20.486 --> 05:21.863
ACE:
This summer,
when Nancy used Nick

05:21.904 --> 05:23.489
as a means
to deal with her grief.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.783
Ouch. Why are we wasting time
on this right now?

05:25.825 --> 05:28.119
Oh, very on-brand, Drew.
Using our crappy odds

05:28.161 --> 05:29.662
as an excuse not to wrap up
your loose ends.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.248
Okay, just because I refuse
to be fatalistic

05:32.290 --> 05:33.916
does not mean...
Fatalistic? You haven't had
a blood bucket curse

05:33.958 --> 05:35.918
hanging over your head
for months.
No! No!

05:35.960 --> 05:37.295
I haven't.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.714
I'm just trying
to actually save you

05:39.756 --> 05:41.132
from dying.
(scoffs): Yeah.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.633
Oh. (chuckles)
BESS:
Save her?

05:42.675 --> 05:45.970
Okay, this is your fault
to begin with, Nancy.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.681
I mean, look at us.
Correct me if I'm wrong...

05:48.723 --> 05:50.933
(sighs)

05:50.975 --> 05:52.852
Cause...

05:52.894 --> 05:54.771
and effect.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.360
Look at us.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.945
The one moment we're all
supposed to be working together,

06:02.987 --> 06:05.531
this is what we do.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.450
If I caused the curse,

06:07.492 --> 06:08.951
I will avert it, too.

06:08.993 --> 06:12.121
I will find a way
to save us all. Today.

06:15.875 --> 06:16.876
(groans)

06:16.918 --> 06:19.003
(bell jingles)

06:28.137 --> 06:29.180
(engine turns off in distance)

06:29.222 --> 06:30.390
(car door opens)

06:34.060 --> 06:36.437
RYAN:
Man, we should've brought
binoculars.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.107
CARSON:
I know we're worried
about Nancy, but binoculars

06:39.148 --> 06:41.692
would cross a line,
obviously.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.361
Is that obvious?

06:44.278 --> 06:46.697
I wouldn't know. My dad used
to pay P.I.s to tail me.

06:46.739 --> 06:47.949
Are you serious?

06:49.283 --> 06:51.869
Yeah. Wanted to know
how many secrets I had.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.455
How do you even know that?

06:54.497 --> 06:56.416
'Cause one of his P.I.s.
reached out to me personally.

06:56.457 --> 06:59.419
So... we came up with a
number that felt right,

06:59.460 --> 07:02.088
and I started paying him
to give Everett misinformation.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.173
I think Dad caught
on pretty quick,

07:04.215 --> 07:06.008
but I think he respected
my initiative.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.844
It was kind of like our...

07:07.885 --> 07:09.971
father-son bonding
activity, you know?

07:10.012 --> 07:13.808
I have some parenting books
I can recommend to you.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.894
Flattered you think
I could learn.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.354
Why not?

07:19.313 --> 07:21.858
You have a chance
to reinvent yourself now.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.526
Right?
Yeah.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.194
Once they set a date
for Everett's trial...

07:25.236 --> 07:26.988
Oh, God. If
they set a date.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.990
Everett's already out
on a million dollars' bail,

07:29.031 --> 07:30.116
and he's got every person
whispering

07:30.158 --> 07:31.701
in the governor's ear.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.578
And you're not gonna stand up
to your father?

07:33.619 --> 07:35.955
I've thought about it.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.624
Even if I had a bulletproof way
to take down Everett,

07:38.666 --> 07:39.792
then what?

07:39.834 --> 07:42.795
Uh, ruin our
family's fortune?

07:42.837 --> 07:44.338
do?

07:45.256 --> 07:48.092
(chuckles):
Work at a coffee shop?

07:48.134 --> 07:49.177
NANCY:
I need sand.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.345
We do live in a beach town.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.805
A-Aglaeca sand.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.599
I know that we've gone through
everything

07:54.640 --> 07:57.560
that you could possibly ever
have that's Aglaeca-related,

07:57.602 --> 08:00.188
but... others have called
to her in the past

08:00.229 --> 08:02.273
and gone to the Keeper
for help.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.941
There is a chance
that one of them

08:03.983 --> 08:05.860
put their portent sand
in one of those lockboxes.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.613
If you could check,
I-I really, really need some.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.364
Well, there's nothing
that matches that description

08:10.406 --> 08:12.033
in the lockboxes from my time.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.535
But there are several hundred
years of haunted objects

08:14.577 --> 08:16.621
stored in the archives.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.372
Yeah.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.251
I will check for anything
remotely sand-related.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.380

26:07.732 --> 26:09.568
until 2:00 in the morning?
Yeah.

26:09.609 --> 26:11.152
You were 12.

26:11.194 --> 26:12.821
Well, I need us to pretend

26:12.862 --> 26:15.198
that it is that night
when everything

26:15.240 --> 26:17.826
was still okay,
because, God, you know,

26:17.867 --> 26:19.953
I have not felt that way
in a long time,

26:19.995 --> 26:21.830

26:23.999 --> 26:26.126

for me, please?

26:30.046 --> 26:33.466
(breathes deeply)

26:41.308 --> 26:43.977

26:47.939 --> 26:50.275

26:50.317 --> 26:53.320
I need him now, yeah.

26:55.864 --> 26:59.242
I can't pretend that
I didn't mess everything up.

26:59.284 --> 27:02.162
And we may never be
what we were,

27:02.203 --> 27:04.873
but that doesn't change
how much I love you.

27:04.914 --> 27:07.334
How could you love something

27:07.375 --> 27:09.628
that was never really yours?

27:09.669 --> 27:10.962
From the moment

27:11.004 --> 27:13.214
Lucy put you in my arms

27:13.256 --> 27:15.634
and made me promise
to protect you,

27:15.675 --> 27:18.470
you are what I've lived for.

27:18.511 --> 27:22.015
That love is my life.
But it was a lie!

27:22.057 --> 27:23.558
Not the love.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.688
Whatever you need to call us--

27:28.730 --> 27:33.610
father, daughter,
Carson, Nancy--

27:33.652 --> 27:36.279
that love lives in me forever.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.787
(whispers):
It lives in us forever.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.791
She remembers.

27:50.126 --> 27:52.629
Even after we die.

27:59.552 --> 28:00.929
Nancy.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.351
I love you, too, Dad.

28:10.897 --> 28:14.317
(crying):
I have to go. I'm sorry.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.320
(sighs)

28:19.239 --> 28:21.199
(door opens)

28:21.241 --> 28:23.243
(door closes)

28:23.284 --> 28:25.578
We were wrong before.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.622
I was wrong.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.749
The sand from the portents,

28:29.791 --> 28:31.418
it represents the trauma

28:31.459 --> 28:33.878
that Odette experienced
in her death.

28:33.920 --> 28:37.132
By using it against her,
it only reminded Odette

28:37.173 --> 28:39.050
why she became the Aglaeca
in the first place.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.803
It only made her angrier
and stronger.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.097
So, that's it, then.
The Aglaeca can't be destroyed.

28:44.139 --> 28:47.225
Not with violence.
But we can appeal

28:47.267 --> 28:49.853
to the human the
monster once was.

28:49.894 --> 28:53.440
There-there has to be
a piece of Odette

28:53.481 --> 28:54.858
left inside the Aglaeca.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.651
If we can tap into that

28:56.693 --> 28:59.612
and remind her
who she used to be,

28:59.654 --> 29:02.240
I think that could be enough.

29:02.282 --> 29:05.160
I think that could be enough
to keep her from killing us.

29:05.201 --> 29:09.289
So, it's the Aglaeca
that wants us dead, not Odette.

29:10.790 --> 29:12.792
So, are you in?

29:21.760 --> 29:23.595
Odette became the Aglaeca

29:23.636 --> 29:27.515
because she died in a state
of fear, rage and suffering.

29:27.557 --> 29:29.684
So, all we have to do

29:29.726 --> 29:31.811
is remind her who she was.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.354
These letters,

29:33.396 --> 29:35.648
she wrote them on her voyage
across the Atlantic.

29:35.690 --> 29:38.485
They're to an Englishwoman
that she loved.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.612
So, Lonesome Ghost Agnes

29:40.653 --> 29:43.031
must have found these
in Odette's possessions

29:43.072 --> 29:45.450
before they locked
her in a cellar?

29:45.492 --> 29:47.410
"Sharay Marie,

29:51.372 --> 29:52.999

30:05.428 --> 30:07.806

your big play, Drew?

30:07.847 --> 30:09.349
You suddenly realize
that love

30:09.390 --> 30:11.434
is the most human thing
that humans can ever human,

30:11.476 --> 30:13.561
and now we're reading
letters to a ghost?

30:13.603 --> 30:15.980
Love is fundamental.

30:16.022 --> 30:17.649
And desperate.

30:17.690 --> 30:20.401
And the one weapon
we haven't tried.

30:20.443 --> 30:21.736
Odette

30:21.778 --> 30:24.197
and the Englishwoman
met in London.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.157
They were really
into stargazing.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.910
Odette made the voyage
to come build a life for them.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.579
(sighs) Even though
the ocean scared her.

30:31.621 --> 30:33.748
I think the letters in
English make that clear.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.626
But the Englishwoman
loved the sea,

30:36.668 --> 30:38.253
especially the beach.

30:38.294 --> 30:41.297
And Odette said
once she landed in America

30:41.339 --> 30:44.384
that she would
send her bottles...

38:07.743 --> 38:09.704
Nancy, what have you done?!

38:09.745 --> 38:11.956
I'm sorry, Hannah.
I can't lose her.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.292
George needs this.
We don't know what

38:14.333 --> 38:15.710
using that shroud would do!

38:15.751 --> 38:17.336
(door closes)

38:17.378 --> 38:18.921

Oh, please.

Please, please.

38:37.690 --> 38:40.526
George, please. Please.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.115
Oh... (crying)

38:46.157 --> 38:49.869

38:49.910 --> 38:52.913

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

Oh.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.838
GEORGE:
Oh. Oh!

39:00.880 --> 39:03.049
GEORGE (coughing):
Okay.

39:03.090 --> 39:05.801
Personal space, Drew.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.011
(grunts softly)

39:07.053 --> 39:09.972
Oh, thank you.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.350
What? Hey.

39:12.391 --> 39:16.312
Hey.
Oh, okay. Oh...

Hey. (panting)

(laughing):
Hey. Hey.

39:42.922 --> 39:47.051
Hi. Hi. Hi.

39:47.093 --> 39:50.304
No more curses.

39:50.346 --> 39:53.682
Aglaeca, blood bucket
or otherwise.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.519
And no urgent mysteries
to solve.

39:56.560 --> 40:01.399
Yeah, for the first time since
we met, we're actually free.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.859
Don't jinx it, Bess.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.904
Yeah, you're right. Sorry.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.949
Well, I, for one, think
we deserve a toast.

40:09.990 --> 40:12.660
I'll get some cider.
Yeah, I'll come, too.

40:12.701 --> 40:14.787
No, it's okay.
