"...subsequent...

01:20.211 --> 01:23.447
...to... I..."

01:26.725 --> 01:27.723
"My dear Enid.

01:27.924 --> 01:30.600
After careful consideration
regarding events

01:30.801 --> 01:34.077
preceding and subsequent to..."

01:46.547 --> 01:48.983
Amen.

02:05.131 --> 02:08.487
If you're going to pray
in this synagogue, do so properly.

02:34.145 --> 02:35.902
Nathan!

02:38.221 --> 02:39.499
Nathan!

02:39.699 --> 02:41.937
Nathan, what is it?

02:42.457 --> 02:43.894
What's wrong with that boy?

02:44.095 --> 02:45.693
Nathan, what's happening to you?

02:45.894 --> 02:47.092
Nathan!

02:49.171 --> 02:50.089
"My dear Enid.

02:50.290 --> 02:51.887
I should like to apologize

02:52.088 --> 02:55.124
if during the investigation into..."

02:56.484 --> 02:58.161
What are you chuntering on
about, Murdoch?

02:58.362 --> 03:00.160
Ah. Sir.
I didn't hear you.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.477
I-I'm, uh, attempting
to compose a letter

03:03.677 --> 03:04.755
but having some difficulty.

03:04.956 --> 03:05.755
Are you, now?

03:05.955 --> 03:08.871
Well, I'm a bit of a wordsmith,
you know.

03:09.073 --> 03:10.670
It's rather personal.

03:10.871 --> 03:12.229
Ah, a love letter.

03:12.429 --> 03:14.466
Well, I'm a bit of an expert
in that field as well.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.664
It's a letter of apology, sir.

03:16.865 --> 03:18.303
Apology?
Who to?

03:18.504 --> 03:20.301
Mrs. Jones.

03:20.501 --> 03:24.657
For involving her and her son
in the telegraph murder case

03:24.857 --> 03:28.453
and for using her as,
well, frankly, sir, as bait.

03:28.654 --> 03:31.051
Murdoch, if you don't mind
a small observation

03:31.252 --> 03:33.488
from someone who knows a thing or two
about women...

03:33.690 --> 03:34.848
try flowers.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.645
Beg your pardon, sirs.

03:36.847 --> 03:38.604
We've just had a report
of a murder in the Ward.

03:38.805 --> 03:39.644
The Ward?

03:39.844 --> 03:41.522
Oh, bloody perfect.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.239
Well, good luck trying to get
a straight answer

03:43.441 --> 03:44.958
out of those people,
me old mucker.

03:57.388 --> 03:58.186
What have we, George?

03:58.387 --> 04:01.223
Sir, the victim is a young man
by the name of Nathan Siebold.

04:01.424 --> 04:03.221
Apparently dropped dead
while praying.

04:03.422 --> 04:04.420
The body?

04:04.621 --> 04:06.298
This way.

04:10.535 --> 04:13.612
It was so horrible.
Confusing.

04:13.812 --> 04:16.089
He just collapsed.

04:16.649 --> 04:18.367
Had Mr. Siebold been ill?

04:18.567 --> 04:20.725
For the last couple of weeks,
he didn't seem well.

04:20.926 --> 04:22.603
Isn't that right, Sam?

04:24.203 --> 04:25.081
I see.

04:25.281 --> 04:26.999
Two weeks.
That's a rather long time.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.558
I thought he was fasting.

04:28.759 --> 04:30.756
But now...

04:31.316 --> 04:32.594
And who reported the murder?

04:32.795 --> 04:35.272
Murder?
What are you talking about?

04:35.472 --> 04:36.591
Someone reported a murder.

04:36.791 --> 04:38.588
Who was it?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.421
Well, gentlemen,
you leave me no choice.

04:46.622 --> 04:47.421
No one leaves.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.418
I'll need to question
everyone here.

04:49.620 --> 04:52.695
Detective, there's no need.

04:52.897 --> 04:54.654
I can tell you
who the killer is.

04:54.855 --> 04:55.933
Oh, you can?

04:56.133 --> 04:56.852
Yes.

04:57.053 --> 04:59.170
It is that book.

04:59.371 --> 05:02.606
That book killed him.

05:07.483 --> 05:11.238
In my experience,
books don't kill people, Rabbi.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.877
No, not literally.

05:13.078 --> 05:15.555
But this book is forbidden.

05:15.755 --> 05:17.833
It drives men mad.

05:18.033 --> 05:20.390
Isn't it simply a Hebrew version
of the Bible?

05:20.591 --> 05:22.069
You mean the Torah.

05:22.270 --> 05:25.945
No, it most certainly is not.

05:29.982 --> 05:32.978
That book is part of the Zohar.

05:33.179 --> 05:34.737
The most dangerous part.

05:34.938 --> 05:35.816
Zohar.

05:36.016 --> 05:38.294
But I thought it was
a commentary on the Torah.

05:38.494 --> 05:40.292
It is, and much more.

05:40.493 --> 05:44.328
There are people like Nathan
who believe hidden within it

05:44.529 --> 05:47.006
is the key
to accessing the powers

05:47.207 --> 05:48.924
that created the universe.

05:49.125 --> 05:51.322
Mm.
Fascinating.

05:51.522 --> 05:53.600
But what has that to do
with Nathan's death?

05:53.800 --> 05:55.798
The boy was obsessed by it.

05:55.998 --> 05:57.716
He stopped sleeping.

05:57.916 --> 05:59.274
Was fasting.

05:59.475 --> 06:00.952
So much so, it killed him.

06:06.669 --> 06:07.866
Jewish whiskey.

06:08.906 --> 06:09.904
Can I pour you one?

06:10.105 --> 06:13.062
Not while I'm on duty.
Thank you.

06:13.262 --> 06:16.138
Why was Nathan so fascinated
with this power?

06:16.339 --> 06:18.297
Ah, Detective.

06:18.497 --> 06:20.615
I have no idea.

06:22.054 --> 06:23.691
As far as I was concerned,
he was a kofer.

06:23.893 --> 06:26.929
What you would call a heretic.

06:27.129 --> 06:30.326
Whatever it was
he was searching for,

06:30.526 --> 06:32.284
we know where it led.

06:32.924 --> 06:34.322
Mm.

06:34.522 --> 06:35.760
If you felt that strongly
about him,

06:35.962 --> 06:37.879
then what was he doing here?

06:38.079 --> 06:39.517
Trouble getting a minyan lately.

06:39.718 --> 06:42.434
Uh, 10 men for prayer.

06:42.635 --> 06:46.590
Last couple of weeks,
Nathan was here quite often.

06:47.191 --> 06:49.548
Against my wishes,
I don't mind telling you.

06:50.268 --> 06:52.505
If you didn't invite him,
then who did?

06:52.706 --> 06:53.664
Sam Fineman.

06:53.865 --> 06:56.021
You met him earlier.
The young one.

06:58.261 --> 07:00.258
Gentlemen, I will not ask you
again to step aside!

07:00.459 --> 07:02.336
Please, Constable,
there's no need for confrontation.

07:02.537 --> 07:05.053
George, what's the problem here?

07:05.254 --> 07:07.411
Sir, they won't allow Dr. Ogden
to remove the body.

07:07.612 --> 07:08.850
Remove the body?

07:09.051 --> 07:10.329
Who is this woman?

07:10.889 --> 07:14.644
Rabbi, this is Dr. Julia Ogden
with the coroner's office.

07:14.845 --> 07:17.522
Rabbi, I need to remove
Mr. Siebold's body

07:17.723 --> 07:19.440
in order to perform
a postmortem examination.

07:19.641 --> 07:21.199
That is impossible.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.637
Jewish law forbids it.

07:22.838 --> 07:25.515
Actually, Rabbi, I'm familiar
with Jewish law in this regard.

07:25.716 --> 07:27.392
And in the case
of suspicious deaths,

07:27.594 --> 07:29.152
postmortems are permitted.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.429
Fine.

07:32.069 --> 07:34.347
As long as someone stays with it
at all times.

07:34.547 --> 07:36.825
To protect the body from evil.

07:38.063 --> 07:39.621
Excuse me, gentlemen.

07:45.097 --> 07:46.136
Nathan!

07:46.696 --> 07:49.133
Oh, no.
No, no.

07:49.333 --> 07:50.772
Uh, ma'am, please.

07:50.972 --> 07:52.410
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

07:52.610 --> 07:53.848
Devra.

07:54.409 --> 07:56.845
- You're to blame for this.
- Please, Devra. You're not well.

07:57.046 --> 07:59.763
Dr. Goldberg.
Is this woman in your care?

07:59.964 --> 08:01.282
Indeed she is, Dr. Ogden.

08:01.483 --> 08:04.238
I'm afraid she must return
to her bed at once.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.598
Come along, now.

08:05.798 --> 08:07.596
Let's go, my dear.
Come on.

08:07.796 --> 08:08.954
Going back up now.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.513
Excuse us, please.

08:10.714 --> 08:12.711
Her name is Devra Begelman.

08:12.912 --> 08:14.789
And what she said meant nothing.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.987
It...
Well, it did mean something.

08:17.188 --> 08:18.985
Just not the something
you think it means.

08:19.186 --> 08:20.224
I'm not sure I follow that.

08:20.425 --> 08:21.743
I'm not sure it can be followed.

08:21.943 --> 08:23.980
Six months ago,
Nathan came to me

08:24.181 --> 08:26.298
claiming he and Devra
were engaged to be married.

08:26.499 --> 08:29.495
He said he had an agreement...
uh, some contract.

08:29.697 --> 08:30.854
Did you see this contract?

08:31.055 --> 08:33.011
Of course not.
It doesn't exist.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.809
Besides, Jewish law doesn't permit
such things because of...

08:36.010 --> 08:37.568
- Rebekah.
- Rebekah?

08:37.769 --> 08:39.966
- From the Old Testament?
- The Torah.

08:40.166 --> 08:43.123
In the Torah, a servant of Isaac's,
upon seeing Rebekah,

08:43.323 --> 08:45.640
asks her family
if she can become Isaac's bride.

08:45.842 --> 08:47.879
And they say,
"Let us ask the maiden."

08:48.079 --> 08:49.237
Precisely.

08:49.438 --> 08:50.237
How modern.

08:50.437 --> 08:54.193
And it is this idea,
that the woman's approval must be asked,

08:54.393 --> 08:56.231
that has been followed
ever since.

08:56.432 --> 09:00.546
So, of course, when the boy came to me
with this story of his...

09:00.748 --> 09:02.705
I had to say no.

09:02.905 --> 09:06.382
Yet clearly Miss Begelman
had feelings for Mr. Siebold.

09:06.582 --> 09:07.740
I would have to agree.

09:07.941 --> 09:09.579
Why did they not simply marry?

09:09.779 --> 09:12.736
Because she had already agreed to marry
someone else.

09:12.936 --> 09:14.534
She was betrothed?

09:15.574 --> 09:16.532
To whom?

09:16.732 --> 09:19.889
Simon Goldberg?
The doctor?

09:20.090 --> 09:21.967
He's got to be 25 years
her senior.

09:22.168 --> 09:24.325
Still, nothing odd
about an older man

09:24.525 --> 09:25.684
and a young girl, I suppose.

09:25.885 --> 09:27.642
No, but Miss Begelman's reaction

09:27.842 --> 09:29.320
would suggest
that she and Nathan Siebold

09:29.521 --> 09:31.159
were more than just friends.

09:31.360 --> 09:32.438
A love triangle.

09:32.638 --> 09:33.716
Possibly.

09:33.917 --> 09:36.714
So the boy goes off tomcatting,
picks the wrong lass,

09:36.914 --> 09:38.632
and jealous fiancÃ©
doesn't appreciate it.

09:38.832 --> 09:39.750
You'd better look into this.

09:39.952 --> 09:41.149
Right away.

09:41.350 --> 09:43.108
Oh, and, Murdoch,
tread carefully.

09:43.788 --> 09:44.945
Carefully, sir?

09:45.147 --> 09:47.384
There's two kinds of Jews
in this town, Murdoch.

09:47.584 --> 09:48.903
There's this new lot,
fresh off the boat.

09:49.103 --> 09:50.301
They stick to themselves.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.699
Then there's the old generation
from England.

09:52.899 --> 09:54.497
Moneyed, with powerful friends.

09:54.698 --> 09:56.815
Simon Goldberg is one of those.

09:57.015 --> 09:58.693
I'll keep that in mind.

10:00.292 --> 10:01.091
Sir.

10:01.292 --> 10:02.889
You have a visitor.

10:12.841 --> 10:13.840
Rabbi, please.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.437
May I remind you
that every drop of blood

10:16.637 --> 10:17.916
must be preserved because...

10:18.116 --> 10:19.874
The body must be buried whole and intact

10:20.074 --> 10:21.552
and as quickly as possible.

10:21.753 --> 10:22.991
Yes.

10:23.191 --> 10:26.548
Rest assured, Rabbi, I will
take good care of Mr. Siebold.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.331
The flowers you sent
were beautiful.

10:45.451 --> 10:47.288
Well, I hadn't heard from you
in some time

10:47.489 --> 10:48.847
and felt as though
I should apologize for...

10:49.048 --> 10:50.406
William, there was no need.

10:50.606 --> 10:53.003
I was merely thinking.

10:59.199 --> 11:00.596
Enid...

11:01.436 --> 11:03.233
...I should never have involved you
in the case against...

11:03.435 --> 11:04.073
Oh, no, please.

11:04.273 --> 11:05.831
T-There's no need
to apologize for that.

11:07.391 --> 11:11.706
Well, I feel as though I should
apologize for something.

11:17.501 --> 11:18.979
I do believe
that's the first smile

11:19.180 --> 11:20.538
I've seen from you in some time.

11:22.217 --> 11:23.855
I worry for you.

11:24.055 --> 11:26.372
For your safety.

11:29.611 --> 11:31.328
St. Michael.

11:32.008 --> 11:33.885
The patron saint of policemen.

11:34.086 --> 11:35.923
Would you keep it, for my sake?

11:37.203 --> 11:38.960
Absolutely.

11:49.992 --> 11:52.189
Hello.
Detective William Murdoch.

11:52.389 --> 11:54.026
We're here to see
Miss Devra Begelman.

11:57.385 --> 11:58.982
Nice area.

12:00.461 --> 12:02.099
The Begelmans have
a lovely house.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.617
You'll have a nice home
of your own someday, George.

12:04.818 --> 12:07.214
Huh.
Not on $1.20 a day, sir.

12:08.974 --> 12:10.172
Yes?

12:11.092 --> 12:12.929
Dr. Goldberg, isn't it?

12:13.130 --> 12:14.168
And you are?

12:14.369 --> 12:15.647
Detective William Murdoch.

12:15.847 --> 12:17.205
And this is
Constable George Crabtree.

12:17.406 --> 12:18.764
We're here to see Miss Begelman.

12:18.964 --> 12:21.321
I'm afraid that she's not
up to visitors, Detective.

12:21.523 --> 12:24.359
That's fine.
We'll speak with you, then.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.117
This is not a good time.

12:27.957 --> 12:31.192
Detective, you must understand that...
Detective!

12:38.546 --> 12:39.745
She's delirious.
Take her arms.

12:39.945 --> 12:41.903
You tried to keep us apart!

12:42.103 --> 12:43.581
But she's mine!

12:43.781 --> 12:45.699
She'll die without me!
Don't you see?!

12:45.900 --> 12:46.938
Who is she referring to?

12:47.139 --> 12:48.337
No!
Don't you see?!

12:48.538 --> 12:50.255
Roll up her sleeve.

12:50.456 --> 12:52.573
Sir, I think she thinks
we're trying to kill her.

12:52.774 --> 12:53.811
What are you injecting her with?

12:54.013 --> 12:55.170
It's a sedative.

12:55.371 --> 12:57.968
You can't stop our love.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.645
You can't stop it!

13:02.124 --> 13:03.762
Shh.

13:14.434 --> 13:18.069
Rabbi, I believe I know
what caused Nathan's death.

13:18.270 --> 13:20.667
But to confirm it, I'll need to perform
one last procedure.

13:20.868 --> 13:24.063
So what's stopping you?
You've already gone this far.

13:24.265 --> 13:28.500
It requires tissue to be dissolved
in sulfuric acid.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.098
A fingernail would do.

13:30.299 --> 13:35.573
I suppose in the eyes of God
a fingernail, more or less...

13:35.774 --> 13:37.251
what's it gonna matter?

13:37.453 --> 13:39.569
How long has she been like this?

13:39.770 --> 13:41.327
Over a week.

13:43.327 --> 13:45.125
She started complaining
of headaches.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.483
Nausea.

13:46.683 --> 13:49.201
Clearly, she's suffering
from a very serious fever.

13:49.401 --> 13:51.438
Cholera, I suspect.

13:52.878 --> 13:54.875
Now come these damn hallucinations.

13:55.475 --> 13:57.233
My superstitious coreligionists

13:57.434 --> 13:59.071
would put it down
to the work of a dybbuk.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.270
A dybbuk?

14:00.471 --> 14:01.629
A demon.

14:02.988 --> 14:04.466
If she is possessed by a spirit,

14:04.667 --> 14:06.264
it's likely that
of Nathan Siebold's.

14:06.466 --> 14:08.263
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

14:08.463 --> 14:09.901
No, I certainly would not.

14:10.102 --> 14:12.379
Still, you must realize
how it appears.

14:12.940 --> 14:14.257
How does it appear?

14:14.458 --> 14:18.214
That your fiancÃ©e
and Mr. Siebold were involved.

14:19.654 --> 14:23.409
I assure you, Detective,
Devra and I are quite happy.

14:24.648 --> 14:25.487
Perhaps.

14:25.687 --> 14:28.444
But it would be best
if Miss Begelman could confirm that.

14:29.044 --> 14:31.681
As you well know,
that is not possible.

14:32.681 --> 14:34.678
Perhaps her father can, then.

14:35.598 --> 14:37.475
Good day, Doctor.

15:03.173 --> 15:07.767
Nathan?

15:08.368 --> 15:10.285
It's all right, my dear.

15:10.487 --> 15:12.084
Everything's going to be fine.

15:13.523 --> 15:15.081
You just need to rest.

15:39.787 --> 15:41.185
Ah.
Detective William Murdoch.

15:41.385 --> 15:42.782
Here to see Mr. Begelman.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.740
Is busy.

15:44.940 --> 15:46.657
You don't want to make us
ask you twice.

15:47.218 --> 15:50.493
Constable, I don't think
that will be necessary, right?

16:02.838 --> 16:05.313
You're quite mistaken, Detective.

16:05.514 --> 16:08.150
Dr. Goldberg had nothing to do
with that boy's death.

16:08.351 --> 16:11.346
You deny Nathan Siebold
and your daughter were involved?

16:11.546 --> 16:13.742
Uh, Devra is young
and impressionable.

16:13.943 --> 16:16.539
Nathan insinuated himself
in her mind somehow.

16:16.739 --> 16:19.335
He probably used
that meshugga book on her.

16:19.536 --> 16:20.934
Why would Nathan do that?

16:21.134 --> 16:23.450
He wanted a better life.

16:23.651 --> 16:25.527
That's why we all came
to this country.

16:25.729 --> 16:27.526
But getting it through my daughter,
that's not right.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.123
That's very good, Morris.

16:29.324 --> 16:31.480
Constable, this would look
very good on you.

16:31.681 --> 16:33.079
What's your favorite color?

16:33.280 --> 16:36.473
Well, I've been told green
makes my eyes come out.

16:37.313 --> 16:38.711
Uh, but as an officer
of the law,

16:38.912 --> 16:42.106
I can't accept such gifts,
as handsome as they are, thank you.

16:42.707 --> 16:44.304
Don't get me wrong, Detective.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.501
I liked Nathan.
He worked hard.

16:46.702 --> 16:47.979
All my people work hard.

16:48.180 --> 16:49.457
Nathan worked for you?

16:49.658 --> 16:51.455
Yes.
That's how he and Devra met.

16:51.655 --> 16:52.493
He was a good boy.

16:52.695 --> 16:55.570
But that book...
It affected his mind.

16:57.608 --> 16:58.606
Oh.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.402
Uh, something's come up.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.080
Will you excuse me?

17:07.635 --> 17:09.232
George, speak with the workers.

17:09.433 --> 17:10.910
See what you can find out
about Nathan Siebold.

17:11.109 --> 17:12.068
Sir.

17:21.777 --> 17:22.974
Sam Fineman.

17:24.493 --> 17:26.290
I already told those coppers
back at the synagogue

17:26.491 --> 17:27.369
everything I know.

17:27.569 --> 17:29.606
Did they ask you
about the relationship

17:29.807 --> 17:31.243
between Nathan and Devra?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.761
First I heard of it.

17:34.481 --> 17:38.555
You mean Nathan never told
his best friend that he was in love?

17:39.115 --> 17:40.432
We just worked together.

17:42.391 --> 17:43.988
That's not what I was led
to believe.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.146
Then you were misled.

17:45.346 --> 17:48.022
You know of anyone who might have wanted
to harm Nathan?

17:48.223 --> 17:49.302
Nobody I know.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.339
Simon Goldberg, perhaps?

17:51.539 --> 17:54.055
Look, I told you...
I don't know anything.

17:54.255 --> 17:56.013
If you don't mind,
I got to get back to work.

17:56.213 --> 17:58.570
Begelman only pays by the piece.

18:00.808 --> 18:02.923
Oh, so you can't really tell?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.601
All right.

18:04.801 --> 18:06.240
George, find out anything?

18:06.440 --> 18:07.797
Sir, very little.

18:07.998 --> 18:10.394
Apparently, Mr. Siebold
liked to keep to himself.

18:10.594 --> 18:12.672
The only person he really chatted with
was Sam Fineman.

18:12.872 --> 18:14.909
Who just led me to believe
he barely knew Nathan.

18:15.109 --> 18:17.505
I suspect Mr. Fineman
knows more than he's saying.

18:19.583 --> 18:21.181
Chained shut.

18:21.381 --> 18:22.818
Sir, it's a sweatshop, isn't it?

18:23.019 --> 18:24.497
Probably.

18:24.696 --> 18:25.974
Ah. Detective.

18:26.175 --> 18:27.931
- Constable.
- It's Dr. Ogden, sir.

18:28.132 --> 18:29.970
She needs to speak with you urgently.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.764
It's black.
There's no question of it.

18:33.964 --> 18:36.361
Nathan Siebold died
of arsenic poisoning.

18:36.921 --> 18:38.838
How was it administered?

18:39.038 --> 18:40.796
The poison had seeped
into every organ.

18:40.996 --> 18:43.512
Suggesting he had been exposed to it
for some time.

18:43.713 --> 18:47.188
Exactly. Perhaps in his food
or drink or a place he visited.

18:59.852 --> 19:02.128
Or something
he came in contact with.

19:02.689 --> 19:04.126
Quite possibly.

19:08.241 --> 19:10.198
May I borrow this?

19:10.398 --> 19:11.876
Why, of course.

19:12.076 --> 19:12.955
Right, then.

19:13.154 --> 19:16.110
So this is your theory, Murdoch...
The book killed him.

19:16.310 --> 19:17.668
Nathan handled it constantly.

19:17.869 --> 19:19.186
He could have easily transferred
the poison

19:19.387 --> 19:20.785
from his fingers to his mouth.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.942
I suppose we'd best be checking
with the local chemists

19:23.142 --> 19:24.699
to see who's been purchasing arsenic.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.098
The men are already doing so.

19:26.298 --> 19:27.776
And the motive?

19:27.976 --> 19:29.893
I still suspect a love triangle.

19:30.094 --> 19:31.691
Can we even prove there was one?

19:32.291 --> 19:35.126
Nathan Siebold's entire life
was contained in this book.

19:35.327 --> 19:37.044
I'm hoping that these letters
and documents

19:37.244 --> 19:39.241
will offer some concrete proof.

19:39.441 --> 19:40.919
It's all in bloody Jewish.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.716
Yiddish, sir.

19:43.276 --> 19:44.833
And you're conversant, no doubt.

19:45.035 --> 19:46.232
No, I am not.

19:46.433 --> 19:48.069
So while I await
my test results,

19:48.270 --> 19:49.828
I shall consult someone who is.

19:52.426 --> 19:53.183
Why me?

19:53.384 --> 19:56.898
Because I need someone I can trust
to translate those words.

19:57.099 --> 19:58.057
And you were his friend.

19:58.258 --> 19:59.495
I told you, I just...

19:59.696 --> 20:01.692
I know. I know.
You only worked with him.

20:01.892 --> 20:03.091
Why won't you help me?

20:06.048 --> 20:08.404
Mister, when is the last time a cop
helped someone around here?

20:08.604 --> 20:11.160
Mr. Fineman,
your friend is dead.

20:11.361 --> 20:13.197
Right.
A murder.

20:13.398 --> 20:15.675
That's the only thing
that brings you to the Ward.

20:15.874 --> 20:17.633
I'm here now.

20:17.833 --> 20:19.309
And if you don't help me,

20:19.511 --> 20:21.626
Nathan's killer
could walk away a free man.

20:24.943 --> 20:26.661
I got to get back to work.

20:26.861 --> 20:29.377
It was you that called
the station, wasn't it?

20:30.736 --> 20:32.613
You reported the murder.

20:47.195 --> 20:50.590
The first time I saw this,
I took it for the Star of David.

20:51.191 --> 20:52.986
There's a certain resemblance.

20:53.187 --> 20:56.462
In fact, it's the alchemic symbol
for arsenic.

20:57.502 --> 20:59.898
I did not kill that boy.

21:00.099 --> 21:02.734
He had been here
over the course of the past two weeks...

21:02.935 --> 21:05.051
the same period of time
he exhibited the symptoms.

21:05.252 --> 21:06.170
Nonsense!

21:06.371 --> 21:07.489
You said so yourself.

21:07.689 --> 21:09.886
Further, you despised
his misuse of the Zohar.

21:10.086 --> 21:12.761
And I what?
Poisoned him?

21:13.362 --> 21:16.357
Detective, do you really imagine

21:16.557 --> 21:19.513
that I would contravene
one of God's commandments?

21:19.713 --> 21:21.311
Why keep this here, Rabbi?

21:21.511 --> 21:24.108
For the rats.
We have lots of them.

21:24.947 --> 21:27.143
Just another reason
why we're leaving.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.541
- You're leaving?
- That's right.

21:29.741 --> 21:31.418
We sold the synagogue.

21:31.618 --> 21:34.534
Tomorrow we leave the Ward
and move into our new home.

21:34.735 --> 21:36.171
I thought you would have known about it.

21:36.373 --> 21:37.331
Why would you think that?

21:37.531 --> 21:38.728
It was in all the papers.

21:38.929 --> 21:40.007
Not just the Yiddish ones.

21:40.208 --> 21:43.802
Big headlines...
"Hebrews Buy Old Church."

21:44.442 --> 21:45.879
What's this got to do
with anything?

21:46.081 --> 21:47.837
Notice the date.

21:49.756 --> 21:50.593
Six months ago.

21:50.794 --> 21:52.311
Roughly the same time
Nathan Siebold

21:52.513 --> 21:54.709
confronted the rabbi
about Devra Begelman.

21:54.909 --> 21:56.786
You're thinking
there's a connection.

21:57.346 --> 21:58.703
The timing
could be coincidental.

21:58.903 --> 22:00.101
But it does make me wonder.

22:00.302 --> 22:01.899
Where does
an impoverished synagogue

22:02.100 --> 22:03.977
suddenly find the money
to buy a new building?

22:04.177 --> 22:04.975
Goldberg.

22:05.175 --> 22:06.893
The man's a moneybags.
He could have backed them.

22:07.093 --> 22:07.892
But why?

22:08.092 --> 22:10.768
Perhaps he's not as certain of his
engagement to Miss Begelman

22:10.968 --> 22:12.286
as he would have us believe.

22:12.487 --> 22:13.884
Buying off the rabbi.

22:14.084 --> 22:16.241
Listen, let me make
a few discreet inquiries

22:16.441 --> 22:18.797
at the Land Office,
see if I can find some details.

22:19.837 --> 22:20.876
Very good.

22:21.076 --> 22:23.872
I believe Dr. Ogden is here
to consult on my test results.

22:24.471 --> 22:25.349
Gray.

22:25.550 --> 22:26.828
There are traces of arsenic
on the book,

22:27.028 --> 22:28.745
but not enough
to have caused death.

22:28.946 --> 22:31.142
Suggesting that somewhere
in his travels,

22:31.342 --> 22:33.858
Nathan and the book
were both exposed to the arsenic.

22:34.060 --> 22:35.855
That would be my suspicion.

22:36.056 --> 22:37.614
What exactly is this?

22:37.815 --> 22:39.851
It's one of the books
of the Zohar,

22:40.052 --> 22:43.126
a mystical rumination
on the nature of God.

22:43.328 --> 22:45.044
Sounds most intriguing.

22:45.245 --> 22:46.123
For the most part.

22:46.324 --> 22:48.800
However, it does contain
some rather impenetrable poems.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.916
Though some seem to be
a commentary

22:51.117 --> 22:52.116
on the Song of Solomon.

22:52.316 --> 22:54.033
Oh.

22:54.233 --> 22:57.109
"The song of songs,
which is Solomon's.

22:57.310 --> 23:00.265
Let him kiss me
with the kisses of his mouth."

23:00.466 --> 23:03.222
"For thy love
is better than wine."

23:07.297 --> 23:08.614
Were they in love?

23:09.175 --> 23:10.811
I'm certain of it.

23:11.012 --> 23:12.170
A poor working boy

23:12.371 --> 23:14.327
and the daughter
of a wealthy factory owner.

23:14.528 --> 23:16.843
Torn apart by circumstance.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.600
Drawn together by fate.

23:20.161 --> 23:21.517
Star-crossed lovers.

23:24.035 --> 23:25.793
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, George.

23:25.993 --> 23:27.070
The lads have checked
with the chemists,

23:27.271 --> 23:28.309
and I've been through
the poison book.

23:28.510 --> 23:30.506
One name did stand out
in particular.

23:30.707 --> 23:32.065
Devra Begelman.

23:32.983 --> 23:33.982
Interesting.

23:34.183 --> 23:36.379
How recently did she purchase
the arsenic?

23:36.579 --> 23:38.097
Just over two weeks ago.

23:38.657 --> 23:40.734
Roughly the same period
that he had been ill

23:40.934 --> 23:42.611
and she had been suffering
from cholera.

23:42.812 --> 23:44.169
Cholera?

23:44.689 --> 23:48.284
Its symptoms are almost identical
to arsenic poisoning.

23:54.597 --> 23:55.554
You again.

23:55.755 --> 23:58.750
Detective, I thought all
of your questions had been answered.

23:58.951 --> 23:59.909
Not all.

24:00.109 --> 24:02.346
Do you recognize this?

24:02.546 --> 24:03.384
It's Devra's.

24:03.586 --> 24:05.182
It's a beauty treatment
for her skin.

24:05.742 --> 24:06.740
And this symbol?

24:07.540 --> 24:09.736
Well, it's arsenic.
What of it?

24:09.937 --> 24:11.574
All the young girls
are using it these days.

24:11.775 --> 24:14.930
And surely, as a doctor,
you realize that cholera

24:15.131 --> 24:17.567
and arsenic poisoning
have very similar symptoms.

24:18.246 --> 24:19.524
Of course I do.

24:20.084 --> 24:21.961
Nathan Siebold died
of arsenic poisoning,

24:22.161 --> 24:24.957
and I suspect that Devra is suffering
from the same thing.

24:26.795 --> 24:28.192
Oh, my God.

24:28.394 --> 24:30.150
Somebody has poisoned Devra.

24:30.350 --> 24:32.986
Not somebody.
You.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.024
Me?

24:35.983 --> 24:37.581
Why would I possibly
want to hurt her?

24:37.782 --> 24:39.418
Maybe she was betraying you.

24:40.139 --> 24:42.055
Or perhaps
she was accidentally exposed

24:42.256 --> 24:43.574
when you poisoned Nathan.

24:44.133 --> 24:45.331
I warn you.

24:45.532 --> 24:47.328
These are nothing more
than wild accusations.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.886
For now.

24:49.088 --> 24:53.081
But soon, Dr. Goldberg, I assure you,
I will have my proof.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.276
Detective.

24:58.115 --> 25:01.270
Whatever you may think of me
and my engagement to Devra,

25:01.471 --> 25:03.947
I assure you of one thing.

25:04.467 --> 25:06.185
I love her.

25:06.385 --> 25:08.662
More than anything
in this entire world.

25:13.010 --> 25:15.645
How much arsenic
did Miss Begelman purchase?

25:15.847 --> 25:17.521
Eight ounces, sir.

25:17.723 --> 25:19.279
There were only 3 ounces left.

25:19.479 --> 25:21.235
Bloody hell.
What's she doing, bathing in it?

25:21.436 --> 25:23.831
Even if she only used an ounce,
where's the rest?

25:24.031 --> 25:26.146
More than likely it ended up
in Nathan Siebold.

25:26.347 --> 25:27.424
Right.
So it all fits.

25:27.625 --> 25:28.702
Goldberg is jealous.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.858
He did have access
to Devra's arsenic.

25:31.059 --> 25:32.335
Slip the boy the poison.

25:32.536 --> 25:34.013
What about Devra?
Did he poison her, too?

25:34.213 --> 25:34.770
Not likely.

25:34.972 --> 25:36.488
A man like Goldberg
wants to keep his prize.

25:36.689 --> 25:37.526
Right, Murdoch?

25:38.205 --> 25:40.720
Actually, sir,
I'm not convinced of his guilt.

25:40.921 --> 25:42.398
What, you don't think
it's Goldberg now?

25:42.597 --> 25:45.432
Dr. Goldberg seemed genuinely surprised
when I suggested Devra

25:45.633 --> 25:46.829
was suffering
from arsenic poisoning.

25:47.031 --> 25:48.706
Further, he would have needed
regular access to Nathan

25:48.907 --> 25:50.224
in order to poison him.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.100
So now we don't even have
a suspect?

25:52.300 --> 25:53.098
Uh, Detective.

25:53.299 --> 25:55.055
We've just had a report
of a beating coming in.

25:55.256 --> 25:56.772
Bloody hell, Higgins.
Just deal with it.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.249
Well, I think Detective Murdoch

25:58.449 --> 26:00.325
might want to deal
with this personally, sir.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.467
Mr. Fineman.

26:10.667 --> 26:12.663
It appears we need to talk.

26:15.899 --> 26:17.136
I've got nothing to say.

26:17.335 --> 26:19.492
Mr. Fineman, I think you should let us
take you to a hospital.

26:19.691 --> 26:20.570
No.
I'm not going to any hospital.

26:20.769 --> 26:22.086
You've been badly hurt.

26:22.287 --> 26:23.724
I don't have any money.

26:23.924 --> 26:25.999
I don't think that's the reason.

26:33.666 --> 26:35.783
Are you involved
in something illegal?

26:35.982 --> 26:38.058
Is that why you won't cooperate with me?

26:41.972 --> 26:43.568
I believe you are.

26:43.769 --> 26:47.681
And that Nathan was as well...
and it cost him his life.

26:50.597 --> 26:53.710
You say the police won't help,
but when we try to, you refuse.

26:56.665 --> 26:59.060
I'm not doing anything illegal.

27:00.060 --> 27:01.656
What is it, then?

27:05.968 --> 27:07.405
I've been organizing.

27:07.606 --> 27:09.920
Organizing? How so?
A union?

27:10.122 --> 27:12.157
You've seen the way
Begelman treats us.

27:13.755 --> 27:15.311
Who did this to you?

27:17.229 --> 27:19.065
That dumb Pole, Jerzy.

27:20.742 --> 27:21.819
What about Nathan?

27:22.021 --> 27:23.776
Was he involved as well?

27:23.977 --> 27:25.732
The only thing he did
was take my night shifts

27:25.933 --> 27:28.527
the past little while
so I could hold some meetings.

27:29.567 --> 27:31.402
Did Jerzy know this?

27:31.962 --> 27:33.160
I don't know.

27:34.678 --> 27:37.591
George, I believe we need to pay
Mr. Jerzy a visit.

27:37.792 --> 27:38.589
Agreed.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.865
Mr. Fineman,
there is still something

27:41.066 --> 27:42.662
I could use your help with.

27:58.675 --> 28:00.350
Get back here,
you big bastard!

28:06.340 --> 28:09.893
That's quite the cut you have
on your hand, Mr. Piezlowski.

28:10.094 --> 28:13.167
I get
when you throw me to ground.

28:13.728 --> 28:14.725
I sue you.

28:15.524 --> 28:18.439
Are you sure it isn't
from when you beat Sam Fineman?

28:21.314 --> 28:23.230
Where were you yesterday
at 5:00?

28:23.430 --> 28:24.428
When?

28:24.629 --> 28:25.466
5:00.

28:25.667 --> 28:26.904
Comes after 4:00.

28:27.104 --> 28:28.500
Hmm.

28:28.701 --> 28:30.098
Was in shop.

28:30.298 --> 28:31.814
Did anyone see you?

28:32.015 --> 28:33.930
Sure.
Jew boss.

28:34.131 --> 28:35.927
- Mr. Begelman?
- Yeah.

28:36.128 --> 28:38.083
Then say Mr. Begelman.

28:39.961 --> 28:41.277
What about Nathan Siebold?

28:41.479 --> 28:43.313
Do you know anything
about his death?

28:46.788 --> 28:47.945
You really aren't doing anything

28:48.146 --> 28:49.463
to help your case,
Mr. Piezlowski.

28:54.016 --> 28:55.732
Did you just gob on my floor?

29:00.285 --> 29:01.641
Murdoch.

29:06.473 --> 29:08.549
I've just heard from
a colleague at city hall.

29:08.749 --> 29:10.466
Do you know who bought
the old church for the rabbi?

29:10.666 --> 29:11.864
Dr. Simon Goldberg.

29:12.064 --> 29:12.822
Wrong.

29:13.022 --> 29:15.656
Simon Goldberg
and Isaac Begelman.

29:15.856 --> 29:17.453
It seems they've been buying up
worthless properties

29:17.653 --> 29:18.971
all over the Ward.

29:19.170 --> 29:20.767
Why would they do that?

29:20.968 --> 29:22.883
Let's find out, shall we?

29:23.523 --> 29:25.918
You're in big trouble, sunshine.

29:26.117 --> 29:28.513
Hey! Wipe that smirk off your face
and look at me!

29:29.393 --> 29:31.268
Not only did you beat a man senseless,

29:31.469 --> 29:33.025
but you've just gobbed
on my floor.

29:33.665 --> 29:36.380
Detective Murdoch here is gonna ask you
a couple of questions.

29:36.939 --> 29:38.536
If you answer correctly,

29:38.736 --> 29:40.931
then we might be able to save you
from the noose.

29:41.131 --> 29:41.970
Noose?

29:42.170 --> 29:43.805
That got your attention.

29:44.007 --> 29:45.563
We think that you poisoned
that lad

29:45.763 --> 29:47.160
who was after
your boss's daughter.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.275
Not me.
I don't know anything about it.

29:50.475 --> 29:52.949
No?
Convince us.

29:53.150 --> 29:56.143
Start by answering the questions
that are put to you.

29:56.344 --> 29:57.222
Detective.

29:57.901 --> 30:00.256
What do you know
about Mr. Begelman's business?

30:00.458 --> 30:01.933
I-I know all.

30:02.133 --> 30:03.410
What do you know
about his dealings

30:03.612 --> 30:05.368
with Dr. Simon Goldberg?

30:05.567 --> 30:06.446
Goldberg?

30:07.005 --> 30:08.880
He makes money.

30:09.082 --> 30:10.398
A lot of it.

30:10.599 --> 30:13.233
Why are they buying up homes
in the Ward?

30:13.434 --> 30:15.589
They know
city tear it down soon.

30:16.149 --> 30:17.825
Then more buildings come.

30:18.026 --> 30:21.658
Begelman and Goldberg,
they get filthy rich.

30:22.218 --> 30:24.493
And what about
Nathan Siebold's death?

30:24.694 --> 30:26.449
Do you know anything
about his poisoning?

30:26.650 --> 30:28.087
Nothing.
I swear.

30:28.287 --> 30:29.843
Is truth.

30:30.882 --> 30:32.000
I-I answer right?

30:32.200 --> 30:33.476
Very good.

30:33.678 --> 30:35.713
Now there's just
one little matter to clean up

30:35.914 --> 30:37.430
before I'm done with you.

30:42.063 --> 30:44.457
Begelman knows the residents
want out of the Ward.

30:44.659 --> 30:46.773
He also knows the value
of the land will go up soon.

30:46.974 --> 30:48.211
But he doesn't have
the financial clout.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.566
So he needs someone
like Dr. Goldberg to back him.

30:50.767 --> 30:52.962
To cement the deal, he offers up
his daughter in marriage.

30:53.163 --> 30:53.801
Yes.

30:54.002 --> 30:56.515
Goldberg gets a beautiful wife,
Begelman secures her future,

30:56.717 --> 30:58.392
and they both profit handsomely
from the land deal.

30:58.593 --> 31:00.189
But then along comes
Nathan Siebold.

31:00.390 --> 31:02.545
Devra falls in love with him
and the whole plan is threatened.

31:02.746 --> 31:03.783
So they slip him arsenic.

31:03.984 --> 31:04.861
But only a bit at a time

31:05.062 --> 31:06.459
to make it appear
as though he's taken ill.

31:06.659 --> 31:07.736
Diabolical.

31:07.936 --> 31:09.293
But we don't have one bit
of proof, do we?

31:09.493 --> 31:10.490
No.

31:10.692 --> 31:12.806
Sir, Mr. Fineman
is here to see you.

31:13.007 --> 31:14.723
They're mostly
love letters from Devra.

31:14.924 --> 31:17.478
A couple of them are from folks
back in the old country.

31:17.679 --> 31:18.596
And that's it?

31:18.796 --> 31:20.313
Well, there's that one.

31:21.911 --> 31:24.985
That's a marriage contract

31:25.186 --> 31:27.979
promising Devra Begelman
to Nathan Siebold.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.896
Signed by both their fathers.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.173
Is it, now?

31:32.372 --> 31:34.567
You told me a marriage contract
didn't exist.

31:34.768 --> 31:35.965
And it doesn't.

31:36.566 --> 31:38.960
Rabbi, your elusiveness
is growing tiresome.

31:39.161 --> 31:44.710
Detective, this piece of paper exists,
but it means nothing.

31:44.911 --> 31:47.304
As I told you before,
it violates Jewish law.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.660
I suspect you aren't telling me
the entire truth.

31:49.861 --> 31:51.936
You would say this
to a religious man?

31:52.137 --> 31:54.612
Nathan Siebold
was a devout student.

31:54.812 --> 31:55.690
He would have known the law.

31:55.890 --> 31:57.567
So there had to be more
to his visit.

31:59.764 --> 32:01.639
Nathan confronted me.

32:02.719 --> 32:03.715
Showed me the contract,

32:03.916 --> 32:06.311
and I said to him
what I said to you earlier.

32:06.512 --> 32:07.869
"Let us ask the maiden."

32:08.069 --> 32:10.543
And he said, "So ask her."

32:10.744 --> 32:15.295
Not whether she loved him,
but if she loved Simon Goldberg.

32:15.495 --> 32:17.052
But you didn't do that.

32:17.252 --> 32:18.410
There was no need!

32:18.609 --> 32:22.202
As I said to him,
we already asked the maiden.

32:22.403 --> 32:24.998
She said she would marry
Dr. Goldberg.

32:25.198 --> 32:26.954
That's the end of it.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.588
Rabbi, was Jewish law
the reason for this ruling,

32:30.789 --> 32:32.743
or was it something else?

32:33.264 --> 32:34.221
What are you implying?

32:34.422 --> 32:36.057
Isaac Begelman bought you off

32:36.259 --> 32:38.933
so that his daughter's marriage
to his business partner

32:39.134 --> 32:40.250
wouldn't be jeopardized.

32:40.451 --> 32:42.646
You make it sound so sordid.

32:43.446 --> 32:44.603
Isn't it?

32:46.041 --> 32:47.158
Look around.

32:47.359 --> 32:48.995
Look how we live.

32:49.195 --> 32:53.787
So when Begelman came forward
to help, who am I to refuse?

32:54.346 --> 32:57.100
What of Nathan and Devra
and their love for one another?

32:57.301 --> 32:58.857
Given the same choice,

32:59.058 --> 33:01.014
knowing it would better
the lives of so many,

33:01.214 --> 33:02.531
I would do it again.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.283
All for the greater good.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.560
My conscience is clear.

33:12.194 --> 33:15.507
I met Max Siebold on the boat
coming over 15 years ago.

33:15.707 --> 33:16.505
My wife was dead.

33:16.706 --> 33:19.181
I didn't know if I'd be able
to take care of Devra.

33:19.382 --> 33:21.377
So you arranged a marriage.

33:21.578 --> 33:22.974
Max claimed he had money.

33:23.175 --> 33:24.851
It was for Devra I did it.

33:25.411 --> 33:29.163
We parted company
on the dock in Halifax.

33:29.363 --> 33:32.756
That was the last time I ever heard
of Max or that contract.

33:32.956 --> 33:34.554
Until Nathan showed up.

33:34.754 --> 33:35.792
Yes.

33:36.471 --> 33:38.745
Out of respect for his father,
I offer him a job.

33:38.947 --> 33:39.744
How does he repay me?

33:39.944 --> 33:41.061
He tries to steal away
my daughter,

33:41.262 --> 33:42.699
even though
she's already in love.

33:42.900 --> 33:43.937
With Dr. Goldberg.

33:44.138 --> 33:45.534
Of course with Dr. Goldberg.

33:45.734 --> 33:47.490
Whose fortune
conveniently enables you

33:47.691 --> 33:49.207
to finance your land deals.

33:49.407 --> 33:50.725
And so what?

33:50.925 --> 33:53.160
Uh, I'm a murderer?

33:53.361 --> 33:54.518
No.

33:54.717 --> 33:57.232
No, you're a man who had a boy
nearly beaten to death

33:57.434 --> 33:59.109
for trying to organize a union.

33:59.310 --> 34:02.942
You're a man who has sold
his daughter... twice.

34:03.143 --> 34:04.299
That's enough.

34:04.860 --> 34:06.816
Do you deny buying up land
in the Ward,

34:07.017 --> 34:08.254
knowing it will increase
in value?

34:08.454 --> 34:10.130
Do you deny running a sweatshop?

34:10.330 --> 34:11.847
So that's what this is?

34:12.047 --> 34:13.842
The Jew is buying land.
The Jew is getting ahead.

34:14.043 --> 34:15.799
What's it gonna be next?
The Jew is poisoning wells?

34:16.000 --> 34:17.277
This is about murder,
Mr. Begelman.

34:17.478 --> 34:19.313
No, this is about persecution.

34:19.513 --> 34:21.909
This is a witch hunt,
and I will not tolerate it any longer.

34:22.109 --> 34:25.262
So either you provide your proof
or you let me go.

34:27.659 --> 34:30.453
I thought so.

34:45.826 --> 34:48.341
Begelman's guilty.
I'm certain of it.

34:48.542 --> 34:49.619
But proving it...

34:49.820 --> 34:50.976
Look, you've shown
motive and means.

34:51.178 --> 34:53.213
But opportunity...
I don't see it.

34:53.694 --> 34:56.007
You mean how the poison
was administered?

34:56.208 --> 34:59.082
You have a boy, a girl, and a book
all exposed to arsenic.

34:59.283 --> 35:01.398
Find out where,
and you might catch the killer.

35:01.599 --> 35:02.956
All this talk of love triangles

35:03.156 --> 35:05.152
must be clouding
your bloody noggin.

35:19.247 --> 35:20.245
"Behold...

35:20.964 --> 35:23.479
thou art fair, my love.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.992
For thy love is better
than wine."

35:29.988 --> 35:31.744
William.

35:32.264 --> 35:35.378
This is so lovely,
meeting here like this on a whim.

35:36.137 --> 35:38.891
I must confess,
I am not here on a whim.

35:39.091 --> 35:41.366
Enid, there's something
I must tell you.

35:41.567 --> 35:43.404
Of course.

35:43.603 --> 35:45.958
I thought I was over her.

35:47.996 --> 35:53.505
The truth is...

35:55.024 --> 36:00.493
The truth is,
this case is proving nettlesome.

36:01.292 --> 36:04.885
Is this why you wanted
to see me, William?

36:05.085 --> 36:06.761
To discuss the case?

36:07.321 --> 36:10.394
No.

36:10.595 --> 36:12.870
Yet it is
a very fascinating one.

36:13.071 --> 36:16.464
It seems two young people
were promised to each other

36:16.665 --> 36:18.420
when they were very young.

36:18.620 --> 36:20.417
And in spite of all odds,

36:20.617 --> 36:22.893
separated by many years
and many miles,

36:23.093 --> 36:25.447
they somehow came together.

36:26.048 --> 36:28.163
Of course they did, William.

36:28.843 --> 36:30.638
It was their destiny.

36:31.198 --> 36:33.713
When two people
are meant to be together,

36:33.914 --> 36:36.428
nothing can keep them apart.

36:37.947 --> 36:39.702
Don't you agree?

36:42.459 --> 36:43.456
William?

36:53.638 --> 36:55.195
The steam.

36:55.795 --> 36:57.231
That's how it was done.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.507
How what was done?

37:01.425 --> 37:02.861
Enid, I...

37:03.062 --> 37:05.177
I'm very sorry.
I...

37:05.378 --> 37:07.053
William...

37:10.369 --> 37:14.920
Sam, you told me Nathan had been working
your shifts for you.

37:15.839 --> 37:17.075
Yeah.
What about it?

37:17.635 --> 37:18.712
For how long?

37:19.671 --> 37:20.988
Couple weeks.

37:22.227 --> 37:25.102
Roughly the same amount of time
Nathan had been ill.

37:26.061 --> 37:28.376
Yeah, I guess
that would be about right.

37:30.372 --> 37:34.125
Sam, I believe
that poison was meant for you.

37:34.724 --> 37:35.881
Me?

37:36.082 --> 37:40.673
It was planted in your machine
to stop you from organizing.

37:43.869 --> 37:47.342
So... Nathan died instead of me?

37:49.937 --> 37:52.852
He'd... He'd still be alive
if I hadn't...

37:53.691 --> 37:59.080
Sam... did Devra ever visit him
on those midnight shifts?

38:00.279 --> 38:01.596
I-I don't know.
I...

38:01.797 --> 38:03.832
I don't.
I really don't.

38:05.190 --> 38:06.947
Oh, God.

38:07.946 --> 38:10.141
There's nothing
you could have done.

38:12.618 --> 38:15.251
I knew Begelman was evil,
but this...

38:17.967 --> 38:20.202
I have had enough
of these intrusions, Detective.

38:20.403 --> 38:22.558
I just need a word
with Miss Begelman.

38:22.759 --> 38:23.995
She is feeling better,
is she not?

38:24.197 --> 38:25.792
The arsenic has mostly left
her body.

38:25.993 --> 38:26.831
But she's still very weak.

38:27.031 --> 38:28.428
She's in no condition
for your questions.

38:28.629 --> 38:31.023
I will be brief,
I can assure you.

38:31.822 --> 38:32.860
Very well.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.375
If it will finally bring an end
to all this.

38:48.393 --> 38:49.989
Miss Begelman?

38:56.779 --> 38:58.694
I'm Detective William Murdoch.

39:05.762 --> 39:07.358
Is this about Nathan?

39:10.992 --> 39:12.749
You were in love with him, weren't you?

39:13.748 --> 39:17.740
I knew from the moment I saw him
that we were meant to be.

39:18.420 --> 39:21.333
You met Nathan
in your father's factory.

39:23.531 --> 39:26.125
We found ways to be together.

39:28.721 --> 39:30.676
I would go in after midnight,

39:30.877 --> 39:33.912
when Nathan was the only one
in the pressing room.

39:40.660 --> 39:42.017
No one knew.

39:44.294 --> 39:46.289
How did you find out?

39:46.490 --> 39:50.002
You both breathed steam in
from the pressing machine.

39:50.202 --> 39:53.197
I believe it was contaminated
with arsenic.

39:53.756 --> 39:55.113
Nathan more so.

39:55.313 --> 39:57.469
And it cost him his life.

39:59.626 --> 40:00.464
But...

40:00.663 --> 40:04.496
But why would the machine
have arsenic in it?

40:05.575 --> 40:08.010
It was intended for Sam Fineman,

40:08.210 --> 40:10.046
to stop him
from forming a union.

40:10.246 --> 40:13.121
Who would do such a thing?

40:14.440 --> 40:19.030
Devra... the arsenic that you
had been using on your face.

40:19.590 --> 40:21.865
Whose idea was it
to purchase it?

40:22.425 --> 40:25.298
Papa said that I should buy some

40:25.500 --> 40:28.174
to make my skin glow
for the wedding.

40:34.763 --> 40:36.200
You mean...

40:37.159 --> 40:38.276
...Papa...

40:40.393 --> 40:42.149
I'm sorry.

41:02.154 --> 41:05.148
I always thought that it was
a passing infatuation.

41:05.908 --> 41:09.740
That one day
she would come to love me.

41:10.738 --> 41:13.253
Do you know
what it's like to love someone

41:13.455 --> 41:15.650
and know that their heart
isn't yours?

41:17.326 --> 41:19.163
I believe I do.

41:20.322 --> 41:22.677
If only I could undo everything.

41:22.877 --> 41:24.633
For Devra's sake.

41:26.111 --> 41:28.107
You love her that much?

41:29.426 --> 41:31.900
More than you could
possibly imagine.

41:47.473 --> 41:48.910
And you're sure
there's arsenic here?

41:49.110 --> 41:51.904
There should be traces of it
throughout the immediate area.

41:52.104 --> 41:54.819
What is the meaning of this?
First you invade my home.

41:55.020 --> 41:56.257
Then you turn my factory
upside down.

41:56.456 --> 41:57.654
When will this harassment cease?

41:57.854 --> 42:00.049
When you're revealed
for the murderer you are.

42:00.250 --> 42:01.247
I am no such thing.

42:01.448 --> 42:03.285
We believe that you put arsenic
in that machine

42:03.484 --> 42:05.640
to keep your factory
from being unionized.

42:05.840 --> 42:06.678
Me?

42:07.238 --> 42:09.233
There's many people here
don't want a union.

42:09.434 --> 42:10.910
They could do it
as easily as me.

42:11.111 --> 42:13.106
You did ask your daughter
to buy the arsenic.

42:13.307 --> 42:15.023
So it's a crime to want
your daughter to look beautiful

42:15.223 --> 42:16.540
on her wedding day?

42:16.740 --> 42:18.616
Have you nothing more, Detective?

42:18.817 --> 42:21.292
You'll not get away with this.
That much I promise.

42:21.493 --> 42:23.607
No court of law
would convict me.

42:23.809 --> 42:26.083
Is that an admission of guilt,
Mr. Begelman?

42:26.284 --> 42:28.519
No.
It's not.

42:29.078 --> 42:31.993
But I think it's time
to contact my barristers.

42:43.333 --> 42:44.570
Mr. Goldberg!

42:46.567 --> 42:47.924
Now she's free of him.

42:52.957 --> 42:54.193
And me.

43:14.478 --> 43:16.074
Coming to the cemetery?

43:16.274 --> 43:17.591
I don't think so.

43:18.391 --> 43:19.668
I understand Miss Begelman

43:19.867 --> 43:21.784
will be taking over
her father's factory.

43:21.985 --> 43:24.180
Yeah.
That's what I hear.

43:24.939 --> 43:27.932
Apparently, she thinks
unions is a good idea.

43:28.133 --> 43:30.248
Oh. Well, good luck
with the organizing.

43:30.449 --> 43:32.804
I know who to call
if I have any trouble, don't I?

43:33.364 --> 43:35.280
Indeed you do.

43:39.513 --> 43:40.630
That poor girl.

43:41.749 --> 43:44.343
Her father cost her
the love of her life.

43:45.502 --> 43:48.775
Dr. Goldberg... He'll...
He'll hang, won't he?

43:48.976 --> 43:50.572
I think so.

43:51.371 --> 43:53.366
He did love her.

43:53.567 --> 43:54.644
Yes, he did.

43:54.845 --> 43:56.840
So much so
that he ensured her father

43:57.041 --> 43:59.077
could never hurt her again.

43:59.277 --> 44:01.871
I suppose now
she's free to find another.

44:04.429 --> 44:06.783
I'm not sure about that,
William.

44:07.423 --> 44:10.417
Can you find true love
more than once in a lifetime?

44:12.054 --> 44:13.770
I don't know.

44:16.048 --> 44:17.324
I should be going.

44:17.525 --> 44:18.203
Yes.

44:18.404 --> 44:19.201
Good day, Doctor.

44:19.401 --> 44:20.719
Detective.

44:30.981 --> 44:34.974
"Dear Enid..."

44:35.305 --> 44:41.646
