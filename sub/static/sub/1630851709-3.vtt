00:01.034 --> 00:07.607
reads words on screen

00:11.111 --> 00:15.482
<i>Tonight, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada...</i>

00:15.548 --> 00:18.018
Welcome to the first
ever rose ceremony

00:18.084 --> 00:20.854
in Canadian
Paradise history.

00:20.920 --> 00:21.688
So, what are you
gonna do tonight?

00:21.755 --> 00:22.655
You know what, dude,
I'm done here.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.357
Like what about the
connection with Stacy?

00:24.424 --> 00:25.725
Who are you gonna pick tonight?

00:25.792 --> 00:28.495
Chris wants Caitlin.
It's not happening.

00:28.561 --> 00:29.929
I'm just so emotionally
exhausted.

00:29.996 --> 00:31.798
I don't feel the fight.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.333
Ugh.

00:35.135 --> 00:37.504
Oh, got a newcomer coming.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.073
Oh, my god,
he's a Greek god.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.809
Who's this coming in?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.744
How many guys are
gonna be here?

00:44.811 --> 00:47.414
Guys no longer in the power.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.648
I don't like it.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.584
There's a lot of guys that are
trying to prove to the women

00:51.651 --> 00:55.922
that they deserve a rose.
Let the best man win.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.458
They're spinning.
Unpredictable, these women.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.463
You know, I definitely have
feelings for Angela.

01:03.530 --> 01:06.433
And then I also have these
feelings for you too.

01:06.499 --> 01:09.436
I'm at a crossroads when it
comes to Angela and Stacy.

01:09.502 --> 01:11.538
Brendan M.'s making me
look stupid.

01:11.604 --> 01:13.039
It's bullshit.
I'm annoyed.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.541
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.810
Vay and Kamil are
sitting at the bar,

01:16.876 --> 01:20.647
and I don't like watching
her with him, at all.

01:20.713 --> 01:21.881
Where's your cowboy?

01:21.948 --> 01:23.349
I know in real life you
wouldn't go for him.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.184
Who would you see me with?

01:24.250 --> 01:26.019
No one that's
available right now.

01:26.085 --> 01:28.054
What does that mean, Kamil?

01:28.121 --> 01:32.091
Vay had a talk with Kamil about
how you're really not her type.

01:32.158 --> 01:35.628
Not a chance this guy's
getting away scot free!

01:35.695 --> 01:38.798
Why did you even say, "You know
what, how's things with Joey?"

01:38.865 --> 01:39.799
Why not?

01:39.866 --> 01:43.102
Ooh, shit!

01:43.169 --> 01:45.839
Uh-oh, trouble in Paradise.

01:55.114 --> 01:58.651
The guys have the power tonight.

01:58.718 --> 02:00.553
They are giving out the roses.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.022
And, since Alice
self-eliminated,

02:03.089 --> 02:07.861
that means that there's only
one girl going home.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.630
It's looking like David is the
only one that isn't spoken for.

02:10.697 --> 02:14.133
And, it looks like it's
between me and Ana.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.768
I'm pretty scared.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.539
It sucks.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.844
Good evening, and welcome to
the first ever rose ceremony

02:24.911 --> 02:27.881
in Canadian
Paradise history.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.150
Things have been moving fast.
You've been getting to know

02:30.216 --> 02:33.920
each other, and you've all
been making connections.

02:33.987 --> 02:38.091
And that makes tonight
that much tougher.

02:38.157 --> 02:43.163
Gentlemen, 7 of you will be
handing out roses.

02:43.229 --> 02:47.600
Ladies, there are 8 of you.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.670
Which unfortunately
means one of you

02:50.737 --> 02:55.508
will be going home tonight.
I wish you all the best.

02:55.575 --> 02:58.478
And with that,
let's get started.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.484
Brendan S.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.830
Illeana...

03:21.901 --> 03:23.970
Illeana, will you
accept this rose?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.738
I will.

03:29.108 --> 03:31.044
Brendan M.

03:36.082 --> 03:39.218
Angela...

03:39.285 --> 03:41.120
Angela, will you
accept this rose?

03:41.187 --> 03:43.056
I will, thank you.

03:46.092 --> 03:48.027
You did good.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.164
Joey...

04:00.273 --> 04:01.841
Vay...

04:04.744 --> 04:06.779
- Will you accept this rose?
- Of course.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.885
Honestly, not a good time
because it seems like

04:12.952 --> 04:15.888
everybody is so coupled.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.857
Jeremy...

04:20.827 --> 04:22.528
Kit?

04:25.298 --> 04:27.567
Will you accept this rose?

04:27.634 --> 04:29.202
I will.

04:34.874 --> 04:37.977
I tried everything I could've
and I can't force a connection.

04:38.044 --> 04:41.047
Like, I don't
want to go home.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.915
Chris...

04:48.621 --> 04:50.290
I don't want Chris' rose.

04:50.356 --> 04:54.193
He should give it to Stacy.

04:54.260 --> 04:58.331
I just hope that Kamil
still knows...

04:58.398 --> 05:01.934
that I'm into him. And like,
that's all I want.

05:06.305 --> 05:09.842
He really wants Caitlin and,
she's not for him.

05:09.909 --> 05:11.911
He's not getting
what he wants.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.913
It's not happening, at all.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.117
I feel like I found someone
that I could trust

05:18.184 --> 05:19.919
with my future family.

05:22.221 --> 05:25.124
And I'm not just gonna let
someone walk over me.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.299
Stacy...

05:37.670 --> 05:41.040
- Will you accept this rose?
- I will.

05:41.107 --> 05:45.611
I do want to make this clear
that after today's events,

05:45.678 --> 05:49.248
I will no longer be pursuing
where this goes.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.355
Okay.

05:56.422 --> 05:57.990
I feel really disrespected
by Chris because

05:58.057 --> 06:03.830
I feel like I was led on.
I'm not here for dishonesty.

06:03.896 --> 06:07.333
If I wanted to give the
rose to Caitlin,

06:07.400 --> 06:09.635
I would have given
the rose to Caitlin.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.338
And I just wanted the
freedom to have the choice.

06:12.405 --> 06:15.408
You know what, I have my
process and I have right to

06:15.475 --> 06:19.645
explore my options in
the way that I want.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.214
Kamil...

06:29.155 --> 06:31.057
Caitlin.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.828
- Will you accept this rose?
- Absolutely.

06:47.774 --> 06:51.110
This is the final rose
of the evening.

06:51.177 --> 06:52.879
David.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.822
Alice is gone and I feel...

07:02.889 --> 07:05.758
kind of lost now.

07:05.825 --> 07:09.428
On Ana's side, I have a really
lovely connection with her.

07:09.495 --> 07:12.698
With Lisa, we have our history.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.768
I have no idea where
her head is at.

07:18.004 --> 07:21.274
Obviously, this is a
unique situation.

07:21.340 --> 07:26.479
And I inevitably have to hurt
somebody, and I'm sorry.

07:26.546 --> 07:30.216
But, I have decided to give
it to someone who I feel

07:30.283 --> 07:32.018
has had a rough go.

07:32.084 --> 07:36.856
And I'm hoping by giving her
another week,

07:36.923 --> 07:39.425
she can find what
she's looking for.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.227
So, Lisa.

07:45.031 --> 07:47.967
I will take this as
an apology rose

07:48.034 --> 07:51.003
́cause I want to forgive,
and I want to forget.

07:51.070 --> 07:52.872
Thank you.

07:52.939 --> 07:56.409
I wish you the best.

08:00.012 --> 08:03.316
Ana, you have not
received a rose.

08:03.382 --> 08:07.987
I need you to say your goodbyes
and leave Paradise immediately.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.191
I really wanted to hug you.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.535
- Bye, guys.
- Love you!

08:27.006 --> 08:30.843
I think that David came in here
wanting to redeem himself.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.378
I don't think he's
being genuine,

08:32.445 --> 08:34.247
and I tried to give him the
benefit of the doubt.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.784
We don't cry over men,
darling.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.424
I think David's speech is
bullshit and he's trying to

08:45.491 --> 08:48.861
save face, so he doesn't
look like a complete D-bag.

08:52.565 --> 08:56.235
Accepting David's rose
felt dirty.

08:56.302 --> 08:59.805
I did it because I wanted to
see who came this week,

08:59.872 --> 09:02.141
but it didn't feel good.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.910
Not my proudest moment.

09:09.982 --> 09:14.287
♪ [Rock music
continues] ♪

10:33.733 --> 10:35.167
You wanna sit on my back
while I do pushups?

10:35.234 --> 10:36.402
Hundo.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.408
Well, back up a little bit!

10:42.475 --> 10:46.178
- Oh-ho!
- Aw! How cute is that?

10:46.245 --> 10:49.215
Now I'm just feeling good.
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

10:49.281 --> 10:51.317
Yo, fam.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.353
Today's a new day.
We're past rose ceremony.

10:54.420 --> 10:57.923
My energy's just like on a high
vibe frequency right now.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.526
Because the women are in power!

11:00.593 --> 11:03.029
- How are you feeling?
- So much stress now.

11:03.095 --> 11:04.463
́Cause I'm on
the other side.

11:04.530 --> 11:06.399
The tables
have turned.

11:06.465 --> 11:07.500
Yeah.

11:07.566 --> 11:12.538
Guys no longer in the power.
We get no roses to give.

11:12.605 --> 11:13.673
I don't like it,
I don't like it.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.975
I like it the other way.
I don't like it.

11:19.078 --> 11:20.312
Post rose ceremony,

11:20.379 --> 11:23.549
we've got some couples
locked down, okay.

11:23.616 --> 11:28.587
But I think there's a little
bit of drama on the beach.

11:28.654 --> 11:31.991
Stace ain't [beep]ing with
Chris right now.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.427
I'm sorry, but there's no
way she's talking to him

11:34.493 --> 11:36.595
anymore after that
rose ceremony.

11:36.662 --> 11:39.632
Forget about it.

11:39.698 --> 11:43.202
- Put some heat on the ball!
- You gotta run, bro!

11:43.269 --> 11:47.440
I went to bed thinking that I
did make some mistakes.

11:47.506 --> 11:50.242
I don't know, whatever.
Let's get a drink.

11:50.309 --> 11:54.480
I just didn't imagine any of
this going the way that it did.

11:54.547 --> 11:58.350
I'm feeling really frustrated
and a little defeated.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.286
Don't get me wrong, I feel
like we should all still be

12:00.352 --> 12:02.455
exploring our connections and
seeing where things go,

12:02.521 --> 12:04.523
but just be honest.

12:04.590 --> 12:08.494
You know, I don't think what
Chris did was right.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.330
I'm proud that Stacy
stood up for herself.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.600
She doesn't need to pursue him
any further and, you know,

12:14.667 --> 12:18.571
he needed to be reprimanded
for his actions.

12:18.637 --> 12:21.173
So, I'm excited.
It's a new day in Paradise.

12:38.357 --> 12:40.559
My name is Alex.
I am 32 years old.

12:40.626 --> 12:43.129
I was on Rachel Lindsay's
season of The Bachelorette.

12:43.195 --> 12:46.132
I was also on Bachelor in
Paradise Australia.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.801
- Alex! How are you?
- Pleasure.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.036
- Ah, I'm great.
- Welcome to Paradise.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.206
- Thank you.
- This is familiar to you.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.275
I mean, you say it's familiar,
but it's never the same.

12:56.342 --> 12:59.245
You know, I don't think you
can do this, you know,

12:59.311 --> 13:01.514
5, 10 times and ever be
comfortable with it.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.083
It's definitely gonna have
its challenges for me.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.218
I am a bit more introverted.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.419
Well, we're happy
to have you.

13:07.486 --> 13:10.289
Before you go actually,
I have this.

13:10.356 --> 13:13.359
- Oh, wow.
- Welcome to Paradise, Alex.

13:13.425 --> 13:16.128
- The beach awaits you.
- Thank you.

13:16.195 --> 13:17.463
I am excited.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.099
I am ready to go out there
and meet someone.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.834
Let's get this thing done.

13:25.871 --> 13:28.407
- Oh, we got a newcomer coming.
- Who is that?

13:28.474 --> 13:31.243
- He looks good.
- Look at that flow, that hair.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.345
Oh, my God.
He's a Greek god.

13:33.412 --> 13:36.782
What's up, guys?
Dun-dun-dun...

13:36.849 --> 13:39.118
Paradise is changing forever.

13:45.357 --> 13:46.826
- Oh!
- Oh, we got a newcomer coming.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.627
- Who is that?
- He looks good.

13:48.694 --> 13:51.397
He's got that tall, dark,
and handsome thing going on.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.232
What's up, guys?

13:53.299 --> 13:56.468
He looks like you from far away.
- Great.

13:56.535 --> 13:58.304
Twin brother, I told you
he was coming.

14:00.372 --> 14:01.373
- Chris.
- Chris?

14:01.440 --> 14:03.776
Like he's incredibly
attractive.

14:03.842 --> 14:06.412
Yeah, hot guy.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.347
- Hi, I'm Lisa.
- I'll give you hug.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.448
Hi, nice to meet you.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.819
Alex looks like a Grecian god.

14:15.087 --> 14:18.757
The boys should be worried
about things getting shaken up.

14:18.824 --> 14:21.260
- Good to meet you, man.
- Hey, how are you?

14:21.327 --> 14:22.494
Good to see you.
You smell good.

14:22.561 --> 14:23.829
Oh, thank you.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.564
Alex shows up.

14:29.735 --> 14:34.240
Built, handsome guy that just
sort of glides across the sand.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.875
"Hello, I'm Alex".

14:40.679 --> 14:42.414
- Alex, good to meet you.
- Alex, nice to meet you.

14:42.481 --> 14:43.849
- You're very handsome.
- Oh, thank you.

14:43.916 --> 14:44.950
Hi, I'm Vay.

14:45.017 --> 14:48.621
"Let me take the women".

14:51.824 --> 14:53.926
- Jeremy? Good to meet you.
- Hi, I'm Kit.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.862
- Kit? Good to meet you. Alex.
- Nice to meet you too.

14:56.929 --> 15:00.633
It's a Amil.
Amil, the twin brother.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.835
- Alex is American?
- Yes.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.037
- Which season?
- Rachel Lindsay.

15:05.104 --> 15:06.672
- Okay.
- He seems cute.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.440
- Like he seems like a good guy.
- Yeah.

15:08.507 --> 15:11.310
Good looking guy.
Good hair. Good body.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.712
I mean, I feel like he's
gonna do some damage here.

15:13.779 --> 15:15.948
Well, anyway, I actually
have a date card.

15:16.015 --> 15:17.583
I would love to just like talk
to all the girls real quick.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.984
- I'll grab you first.
- Perfect.

15:19.051 --> 15:21.320
- Let's go take a walk, Alex.
- Oh, my God.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.554
Okay!

15:22.621 --> 15:25.024
I have to be the first girl to
grab him. I am the only one

15:25.090 --> 15:28.427
that is definitely not locked
down here right now.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.062
- Let's go sit.
- Yeah, show me around.

15:30.129 --> 15:30.963
Okay.

15:31.030 --> 15:34.400
Lisa is a sweetheart,
but my goodness,

15:34.466 --> 15:36.435
if the girl would just try less.

15:36.502 --> 15:37.569
- How's it been?
- It's been stressful.

15:37.636 --> 15:38.837
- I'm not gonna lie, like-
- Really?

15:38.904 --> 15:40.973
Too desperate.
It's too thirsty.

15:41.040 --> 15:45.577
Guys can read it from a
mile away. A mile away.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.546
A lot of people are real
coupled up already.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.714
Already?

15:48.781 --> 15:52.584
So, those two chilling in
the chairs, that's a thing.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.721
The two at the bar,
that's a thing.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.424
Those two, that is a
very solid thing.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.659
- First day, like.
- Oh, okay, okay.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.861
Getting engaged. Hopefully we're
invited to the wedding.

16:02.928 --> 16:03.696
Oh, wow.

16:03.762 --> 16:07.066
Should I go? I will.
Okay, I'm gonna.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.600
- Do it.
- Brrrup!

16:08.667 --> 16:10.836
I feel like you're gonna
get stolen by Stacy.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.671
You might, you might not.
I don't know.

16:12.738 --> 16:14.673
- I have never been stolen.
- I was hoping to just-

16:14.740 --> 16:15.507
Yeah, absolutely.

16:15.574 --> 16:17.576
Go ahead, it was
nice meeting you.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.044
- I gave him the low down.
- Yeah, thank you.

16:19.111 --> 16:22.014
I gave him the low down, so...

16:22.081 --> 16:25.017
I mean,
Lisa's an odd ball.

16:25.084 --> 16:29.955
She has a little bit of, like,
a delusional sense of, I think,

16:30.022 --> 16:31.824
what Paradise might be.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.625
I gave him the lay of the land.

16:33.692 --> 16:34.927
You know, so I can only hope
for the best, but like,

16:34.994 --> 16:36.095
what am I gonna do, right?

16:37.896 --> 16:39.665
What if you're just his type
and he's like-

16:39.732 --> 16:41.700
Well, he's gonna have no idea
other the fact I was just

16:41.767 --> 16:43.902
nice enough to tell him
what's going on.

16:43.969 --> 16:45.504
Well, it might be enough.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.005
Yeah, maybe that's his thing,
you know.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.640
People who are nice enough
to tell him what's going on.

16:48.707 --> 16:50.709
Exactly.

16:50.776 --> 16:52.478
She is...

16:54.146 --> 16:57.082
Just take it easy.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.451
Hopefully she's having
the same convo.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.720
How are you feeling?
Coming in a little bit late.

17:01.787 --> 17:04.089
Just, you know,
a little bit unsure...

17:04.156 --> 17:06.492
of what's gonna happen,
what to expect.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.093
Yeah, but you're
not too late.

17:11.897 --> 17:15.901
I didn't anticipate how quickly
you feel completely helpless

17:15.968 --> 17:18.504
and powerless the second
the girls have the roses.

17:22.674 --> 17:26.512
And now there's more guys
than girls and you know

17:26.578 --> 17:29.548
some of us are going
home this week.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.850
Yeah, I'm gonna steal you real
quick if you don't mind.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.920
Sounds good, of course.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.822
I guess you're the edgy
girl here with the tats, right?

17:36.889 --> 17:39.825
Edgy on the outside.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.162
- Only on the outside?
- Outside only, yeah.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.029
How do you feel about that?

17:44.096 --> 17:45.898
It's Paradise,
so I'm okay with that.

17:45.964 --> 17:46.932
Yeah, he's a handsome man.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.501
Do his thang, baby,
do his thang. I like that.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.670
I think at Paradise you need to
exercise your options.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.639
I need to- I think you need
to go for it and if there's

17:53.705 --> 17:56.575
a more profound connection,
by all means, go for it.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.112
So, what do you do?

18:00.179 --> 18:01.814
Ah, I do IT and accounting,

18:01.880 --> 18:03.615
so information systems
in accounting.

18:03.682 --> 18:06.051
Think of like the two most
exciting jobs you can do,

18:06.118 --> 18:07.953
so accounting and computers
and combine them.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.955
Numbers. Are you
more of an introvert?

18:10.022 --> 18:10.923
Oh, big time.

18:10.989 --> 18:13.192
I need to tell myself, okay,
you can do this.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.960
You can still talk to people,
right?

18:15.027 --> 18:16.195
Because you can be an outgoing
person, but in here-

18:16.261 --> 18:19.064
- But you're still gregarious.
- Yeah.

18:19.131 --> 18:21.900
I feel like there's a potential
for a connection there.

18:21.967 --> 18:24.937
I'm still kind of figuring my
own feelings out in Paradise.

18:25.003 --> 18:27.840
And trying to be someone who
lets my guard down more.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.142
I had an absolutely lovely
conversation with you.

18:30.209 --> 18:31.243
I did as well.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.912
I'm hoping I can take you
out on this date I have.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.848
- I would love to.
- Awesome.

18:35.914 --> 18:38.951
Are they going on a date?

18:39.017 --> 18:41.220
Can I have another
vodka water, please?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.856
You know, I was excited, and I
thought me and Alex were vibing

18:43.922 --> 18:47.759
a bit and then, you pick
Kit on the date. Shocker.

18:47.826 --> 18:51.530
You guys go. I'm gonna go find
other people. Excuse me.

18:51.597 --> 18:54.967
I'm over the moon for
the happy couple. Yeah.

18:55.033 --> 18:56.602
But it doesn't help me.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.719
Are you an experienced canoe-r?

19:13.785 --> 19:15.521
- I know what I'm doing.
-

19:15.587 --> 19:18.090
I couldn't think of a
better first date.

19:18.156 --> 19:20.792
I think it's gonna put both
of us at ease.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.528
You're in charge,
you're taking us on the-

19:22.594 --> 19:26.031
Yeah, I'm doing the steering.
You're doing the propelling.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.000
I'm the motor.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.002
Oh, yeah, you gotta change
sides. You're turning us.

19:30.068 --> 19:30.936
I'm like-

19:31.003 --> 19:35.307
Yeah, that's fine.
You do you back there.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.613
Ah, at least we have
the breeze out here.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.949
I'm here for it.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.886
It's hard not to just feel like
blissful on this date because,

19:47.953 --> 19:50.622
obviously, we're in this canoe
in the middle of a beautiful

19:50.689 --> 19:53.559
lake and I just feel like it's-
that's not an opportunity

19:53.625 --> 19:56.161
you get very often,
to go on any date,

19:56.228 --> 19:59.631
let alone a first date
with somebody.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.200
If we get knocked over,

20:01.266 --> 20:03.135
you're out here with an
experienced canoe-r.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.570
Are you an experienced
swimmer though?

20:04.636 --> 20:05.938
I swam through college.

20:06.004 --> 20:07.172
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.840
I actually, I used to be on
a swim team too,

20:08.907 --> 20:11.210
but it was when I was
in high school, so...

20:11.276 --> 20:14.146
Being in this canoe with Kit
is exactly what I needed

20:14.212 --> 20:17.249
to settle in and be
in my comfort zone.

20:17.316 --> 20:18.650
There we go.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.752
- Helping in small ways.
-

20:37.069 --> 20:40.038
My main issue with her,
it just seems like, yeah,

20:40.105 --> 20:42.107
I gave you my rose and I gave
it to you for a reason.

20:42.174 --> 20:45.978
But at the same time, like
that doesn't mean I'm not

20:46.044 --> 20:48.380
interested in, you know,
looking for other people and

20:48.447 --> 20:49.948
talking to other people.

20:50.015 --> 20:54.219
Angela and I, you know,
obviously have this connection.

20:54.286 --> 20:57.256
But I know we're in
Paradise, you know.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.391
You have to explore
these options,

20:59.458 --> 21:02.160
these other avenues to make
sure that we can find

21:02.227 --> 21:05.230
that one option that
is the right one.

21:05.297 --> 21:06.732
We don't gotta be attached at
the hip at all times of day.

21:06.798 --> 21:09.334
- Exactly, yeah.
- Yeah, bro. I feel that.

21:09.401 --> 21:12.237
I don't want to be like Brendan
S. and Illeana right now.

21:12.304 --> 21:15.173
You know how they're just like,
it's just them two cliqued up.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.843
And they're not really
interacting with anybody else.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.278
I want to be how you guys are,
you know- everyone's just

21:20.345 --> 21:22.814
mingling and chilling and
everything's just cool and easy,

21:22.881 --> 21:23.782
there's a vibe.

21:23.849 --> 21:26.084
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so...

21:31.890 --> 21:33.392
<i>Coming up...</i>

21:33.458 --> 21:36.228
- It's Mike!
- Hi, good to see you.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.729
Mike and I have a
bit of a history.

21:37.796 --> 21:41.733
To continuing where we left off.
- Paradiso.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.934
Two days before you say

21:43.001 --> 21:44.369
she's the mother of your
future children.

21:44.436 --> 21:47.105
- That's not what I said.
- You weren't honest with me.

21:47.172 --> 21:49.941
I'm just so emotionally
exhausted.

21:50.008 --> 21:51.309
<i>And then...</i>

21:51.376 --> 21:53.979
Caitlin does not like me for,
I don't even know why.

21:54.046 --> 21:57.949
She's gonna literally
attack me. I'm scared.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.184
Where's your cowboy?

21:59.251 --> 22:01.053
I know in real life you
wouldn't go for him.

22:01.119 --> 22:05.357
Vay had a talk with Kamil about
how you're really not her type.

22:05.424 --> 22:07.225
Little snake, man.

22:07.292 --> 22:09.161
Oh, I'm gonna show him
Paradise.

22:09.227 --> 22:11.897
I don't care if you're a
space cowboy or

22:11.963 --> 22:14.366
a space whatever you are.
Like, I don't care.

22:14.433 --> 22:17.703
Not a chance this guy's
getting away scot free.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.180
-
- Okay, we'll set it up.

22:28.246 --> 22:29.347
We'll set it up...

22:29.414 --> 22:30.315
- Hey, man?
- What's up, bro?

22:30.382 --> 22:32.017
- Getting some reps in?
- You joining in, man?

22:32.084 --> 22:33.885
- No.
- Come on, man.

22:33.952 --> 22:35.354
I was hoping I could steal
Stacy away for a second.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.556
Do your thing,
bro. Yes, sir.

22:37.622 --> 22:39.224
- Stacy?
- Yes?

22:39.291 --> 22:41.893
- Is now a good time?
- Yeah, let's go chat.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.995
Is Stacy talking to Chris, bro?

22:44.062 --> 22:46.898
It's the first time they're
talking since the rose ceremony.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.900
That should be an
interesting conversation.

22:51.570 --> 22:56.508
- Here it is.
-

22:56.575 --> 22:59.244
I feel like it's important to
clear the air just so she,

22:59.311 --> 23:01.613
she knows, she knows my side.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.315
- How's it going?
- Good, how are you?

23:03.382 --> 23:06.651
- I'm feeling a little rough.
- Okay.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.253
Before you and I
really connected,

23:08.320 --> 23:11.390
I did have a bit of a
connection with Caitlin.

23:11.456 --> 23:13.191
I am aware.

23:13.258 --> 23:15.427
You know, she was kind of
moving in a different direction

23:15.494 --> 23:19.331
and, I still felt something
and I wanted to

23:19.397 --> 23:23.201
close the door on that.
What I wanted to do was

23:23.268 --> 23:25.637
clear the air so I could
spend this week with you.

23:25.704 --> 23:26.772
Mhm.

23:26.838 --> 23:30.175
Just help me align my head
and my heart so that as I

23:30.242 --> 23:33.445
move forward with you, there
would be no distractions.

23:38.083 --> 23:42.421
Very poor timing on your behalf
to have that conversation.

23:42.487 --> 23:44.589
- Right.
- You weren't honest with me.

23:44.656 --> 23:46.558
I'm not gonna be
a second choice,

23:46.625 --> 23:51.963
and that's how I felt. It made
me look like an idiot. You know?

23:52.030 --> 23:55.066
I can just imagine how
he feels, so like...

23:55.133 --> 23:56.701
I get why he wants
to talk to her.

23:56.768 --> 24:00.005
But I also understand Stacy's
point of view as to like why

24:00.071 --> 24:02.674
she felt like a second choice
and why she said what she said.

24:02.741 --> 24:04.643
He feels as though people

24:04.709 --> 24:07.746
don't really understand
his side of things.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.381
I mean, like,
two days before,

24:09.448 --> 24:11.316
you say she's the mother of
your future children.

24:11.383 --> 24:15.253
That's not what I said.
Well, I told one person.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.521
So, you did say it?

24:16.588 --> 24:20.358
I told Caitlin that I saw the
potential as like, the first--

24:20.425 --> 24:22.427
And you just said you
didn't say that.

24:22.494 --> 24:24.429
No, no, I did say that.

24:24.496 --> 24:26.565
The first, the first day
I hung out with her,

24:26.631 --> 24:29.067
I said that to her.
- Okay.

24:29.134 --> 24:32.170
And we continued that
conversation the second day.

24:32.237 --> 24:33.471
Yeah.

24:33.538 --> 24:36.641
Stacy is too amazing to be
anyone's second choice.

24:36.708 --> 24:39.744
Wrong time, wrong time, Chris.
Wrong time.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.979
Would you want to be
someone's second choice?

24:41.046 --> 24:43.348
No, I want somebody who knows
what he has when he has it.

24:43.415 --> 24:44.649
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

24:44.716 --> 24:46.585
Absolutely, yeah.

24:46.651 --> 24:50.188
This is just too much drama too
early on for me to want to

24:50.255 --> 24:53.725
dabble in something I was
not 100% sure on.

24:53.792 --> 24:57.362
Well, I wanted to be 100% sure
on exploring with you,

24:57.429 --> 24:58.797
and that's why I wanted to close
off things with Caitlin.

24:58.864 --> 25:02.567
- Then just be honest.
- Okay.

25:02.634 --> 25:06.037
So, let's hug it out.
Let's be friends.

25:06.104 --> 25:08.707
I don't have any animosity.

25:08.773 --> 25:12.177
I just wanted to make it clear,
like, where we are...

25:12.244 --> 25:14.045
with each other, you know?

25:14.112 --> 25:16.748
And you will find love,
and you will be happy.

25:16.815 --> 25:20.485
But, it's not going
to be with me.

25:20.552 --> 25:22.587
Okay, well thanks for chatting.
- Of course.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.276
I'm Mike.
I'm from Jasmine's season

25:44.342 --> 25:47.312
of The Bachelorette
Canada.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.348
- Who's this coming in?
- It's Mike!

25:50.415 --> 25:52.384
- Mikey's coming in.
- You know him?

25:52.450 --> 25:53.451
Yeah.

25:53.518 --> 25:54.853
Mike, the greatest guy ever.

25:54.920 --> 25:55.720
I'll give you a handshake
́cause I'm sweaty.

25:55.787 --> 25:56.821
- Ah, that's alright.
- Welcome, man.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.791
Mike is from my season of
The Bachelorette Canada.

25:59.858 --> 26:01.526
And, Mike's an awesome guy.

26:01.593 --> 26:02.694
Hey, gang!

26:02.761 --> 26:04.796
He is a firefighter,
he's very funny.

26:04.863 --> 26:06.231
And he's got
lots of muscles.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.732
The girls are gonna
love him here.

26:07.799 --> 26:09.401
We have a new guy.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.202
- What?
- Uh-oh.

26:11.269 --> 26:15.473
Lisa's running.
Lisa, easy, easy.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.809
First, I'll give you the
lay of the land.

26:17.876 --> 26:22.147
Lisa's a really outspoken
Italian girl.

26:22.213 --> 26:24.449
I call her the chicken parm
of the, of the group.

26:24.516 --> 26:25.717
A little meatball.

26:25.784 --> 26:28.753
- It's pretty nice, eh?
- Yes, it is great.

26:28.820 --> 26:31.656
So, I'm just recovering from
Alex showing up and

26:31.723 --> 26:33.825
I see another guy.
I know him from

26:33.892 --> 26:35.794
Jasmine's season from
Bachelorette Canada.

26:35.860 --> 26:38.797
Firefighter Mike.
8-pack Mike.

26:38.863 --> 26:43.134
♪
So tasty to eat! ♪

26:43.201 --> 26:47.305
Chris' personality is very...

26:47.372 --> 26:49.808
Christopher...
It's been a while.

26:49.874 --> 26:51.810
This is surreal.

26:51.876 --> 26:54.679
He's a very interesting,
unique individual.

26:54.746 --> 26:59.851
And, his personality is very...

26:59.918 --> 27:02.454
that's all I got.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.924
-
- Yeah...

27:05.991 --> 27:08.560
- How are ya?
- Not good, but...

27:08.626 --> 27:09.828
Is that good, at least?

27:09.894 --> 27:11.863
I'm pretty sure Kevin's
giving me water.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.031
- Hey, buddy!
- There he is.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.866
You're looking good. You're
looking sharp, how are ya?

27:14.933 --> 27:16.534
Oh, man, good!
Good to see you.

27:16.601 --> 27:18.870
Mike's a hot commodity.
He's funny. He's very-

27:18.937 --> 27:20.372
when he takes his shirt off,
you're gonna like him.

27:20.438 --> 27:21.873
We like Mike, okay.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.341
- I have this thing.
- What does it say?

27:23.408 --> 27:24.409
Read it out.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.512
"Choose someone who
sparks your interest".

27:27.579 --> 27:28.947
Okay.

27:29.014 --> 27:31.282
Kev, you're taken, eh?
No, I'm just kid-

27:31.349 --> 27:32.717
I just miss you.
I miss you.

27:32.784 --> 27:33.585
We'll have a chat.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.887
When I was younger,
I wasn't so open

27:35.954 --> 27:38.790
to the idea of having a
long-term partner.

27:38.857 --> 27:40.525
I'll just give you the
lay of the land.

27:40.592 --> 27:41.660
- Um...
- Yeah.

27:41.726 --> 27:43.395
A little older,
a little wiser now.

27:43.461 --> 27:45.196
I'm ready to open myself up.

27:45.263 --> 27:46.464
- I wanna know...
- Yeah?

27:46.531 --> 27:47.432
Some things.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.268
I need to go meet
those two, or Stacy.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.636
I'm gonna go
get more drinks.

27:51.703 --> 27:52.937
Okay.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.673
I thought you were
chatting with him.

27:54.739 --> 27:55.807
You know, I made
my attempt, man.

27:55.874 --> 27:57.776
I'm not like
being shy. It's-

27:57.842 --> 27:59.277
if you don't feel it,
you don't feel it.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.912
You can't force him.

28:00.979 --> 28:03.248
Hello!
Hey, hey.

28:03.314 --> 28:04.349
Yeah, walk the plank.

28:04.416 --> 28:05.850
Yeah, I'm walking
the plank here.

28:05.917 --> 28:07.218
- How you doing, man?
- Good, man, how are you?

28:07.285 --> 28:08.453
- Brendan, nice to meet you.
- Brendan?

28:08.520 --> 28:09.354
- Yeah.
- Cool, I'm Mike.

28:09.421 --> 28:10.789
- Nice to meet you, boss.
- Right on.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.258
- Hi, good to see you.
- Hey, good to see you.

28:13.324 --> 28:15.226
- Wow!
- Do you want to go have a chat?

28:15.293 --> 28:17.328
- Yeah, let's chat it up.
- Okay.

28:17.395 --> 28:21.499
I first met Stacy when I was in
Vancouver visiting a friend.

28:21.566 --> 28:24.836
Went to a couple bars,
danced it up, goofed around.

28:24.903 --> 28:27.672
Then we went our separate
ways that night.

28:27.739 --> 28:32.711
And, I was hoping I could maybe
see her again. And here I am.

28:33.578 --> 28:34.679
You honestly came
at a good time.

28:34.746 --> 28:37.749
I have the good energy and
I'm feeling the good vibes.

28:37.816 --> 28:39.984
- And there's a cute guy here.
- Oh, where is he?

28:40.051 --> 28:41.786
Oh, oh!

28:41.853 --> 28:43.621
- Oh, it's you.
- Oh!

28:43.688 --> 28:45.723
Yeah, I'm excited
that you're here.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.826
Mike and I have a
bit of a history.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.528
I'm excited to see him again
here in Paradise.

28:50.595 --> 28:54.899
Figure out who he is now.
And go from there.

28:54.966 --> 28:57.736
Stacy, I think you're
kind of interesting.

28:57.802 --> 29:00.305
- Am I?
- Yeah.

29:00.371 --> 29:01.573
Do you want to go on
a date with me?

29:01.639 --> 29:02.607
Absolutely.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.809
Like it's not a huge deal
or anything, but...

29:04.876 --> 29:07.412
- I thought maybe I'd ask you.
- Come here.

29:09.981 --> 29:14.719
Well, let's go. I'm excited.

29:14.786 --> 29:19.023
Nothing really goes the
way I expect it to.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.992
Agh!

29:21.059 --> 29:22.026
We're going on a date!

29:22.093 --> 29:23.928
- Have a seat.
- Well, cheers.

29:23.995 --> 29:26.731
- Cheers, Mike being here.
- Cheers!

29:26.798 --> 29:28.800
Yeah, thanks for having me,
everybody.

29:28.867 --> 29:31.970
I'm happy to see ya.
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

29:32.036 --> 29:37.308
Like, right now, I'm just so
emotionally exhausted.

29:37.375 --> 29:39.043
I just, I don't
feel the fight.

29:42.881 --> 29:47.418
Stacy just really
closed the door.

29:47.485 --> 29:51.923
Ugh.

29:59.430 --> 30:00.398
Ugh.

30:06.671 --> 30:08.139
Here's to a
great first date.

30:08.206 --> 30:10.675
- Yeah, cheers, thank you.
- Cheers.

30:10.742 --> 30:12.010
I would say I
don't have a type.

30:12.076 --> 30:14.979
And, you know, I've never
dated anyone like Kit.

30:15.046 --> 30:16.981
That's part of the surprise,
that's what I was

30:17.048 --> 30:20.919
looking for out here.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.754
What are you looking
for in Paradise?

30:22.820 --> 30:25.123
With complete and
utter transparency,

30:25.190 --> 30:28.159
I want to be surprised
by what I find.

30:28.226 --> 30:30.261
Am I ready to be with
someone forever?

30:30.328 --> 30:31.896
Sure, if the right person
comes around.

30:31.963 --> 30:33.198
Yeah, it's when you're not
looking for it that

30:33.264 --> 30:34.899
you end up finding it.
- Yeah, serendipity.

30:34.966 --> 30:37.202
Yeah, exactly.
You have a great vocabulary.

30:37.268 --> 30:38.203
Oh, thank you.

30:38.269 --> 30:39.837
I don't think I've ever
complimented somebody

30:39.904 --> 30:41.906
on their vocabulary before.

30:41.973 --> 30:43.908
What is your most
reminiscent smell?

30:43.975 --> 30:44.909
Oh.

30:44.976 --> 30:47.212
Everything he's saying is
just said in such

30:47.278 --> 30:49.781
a smart and
intellectual way.

30:49.847 --> 30:52.183
I feel like your annunciation
and how you communicate has,

30:52.250 --> 30:54.986
yeah, I'm like- I feel like I've
never said that to somebody,

30:55.053 --> 30:56.654
but yeah,
you definitely have.

30:56.721 --> 30:57.855
It's ah, synergy.

30:57.922 --> 30:59.691
I don't even know if it's
right to call that a turn on,

30:59.757 --> 31:01.726
but I just think it's something
that you don't think about

31:01.793 --> 31:03.127
being attractive in someone.

31:03.194 --> 31:06.264
But it definitely is very
attractive in him.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.132
Being, someone being assertive.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.568
- I feel like that's something-
- Or oblivious, yeah.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.105
Like, what are you
thinking right now?

31:14.172 --> 31:15.740
I don't like the fact that
the only person

31:15.807 --> 31:16.808
I'm talking to is you.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.077
I'm in your boat,
I'm with you.

31:19.143 --> 31:20.545
- I'm walking around-
- Why?

31:20.612 --> 31:21.646
I'm walking around this place,

31:21.713 --> 31:23.014
and everybody's already
partnered up.

31:23.081 --> 31:24.682
- Why?
- I know!

31:24.749 --> 31:25.884
We're twenty- we like...

31:25.950 --> 31:31.623
I hate that me and Dave are
constantly the odd two out.

31:31.689 --> 31:32.991
It's like, why is the
universe always

31:33.057 --> 31:34.626
bringing us together here?

31:34.692 --> 31:36.294
We're in for the
long haul. We're just-

31:36.361 --> 31:38.796
Imagine every week it's
just me and you hanging out?

31:38.863 --> 31:40.131
They're always hanging out
with each other.

31:40.198 --> 31:41.733
Do they hate each other?

31:46.838 --> 31:49.641
I'd be happy to just stay
here the whole time.

31:49.707 --> 31:50.708
Yeah, me too.

31:50.775 --> 31:56.347
Just lay and kiss and hang out.
- Yeah, what else?

31:56.414 --> 31:58.016
Kamil and Caitlin, are they
in the same boat?

31:58.082 --> 32:00.952
Are they just like locked
in and that's it?

32:01.019 --> 32:02.620
Like, is that it for them?

32:02.687 --> 32:06.924
So, I see Kamil looking
elsewhere sometimes.

32:06.991 --> 32:11.195
- You see his eyes wander?
- Yes.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.298
The girls tell me, like they...

32:13.364 --> 32:16.934
they catch him like kind of
giving me looks here and there.

32:17.001 --> 32:19.370
I think he likes her, but I
don't put it past him at all

32:19.437 --> 32:23.174
if somebody that he thinks
is cuter comes in.

32:23.241 --> 32:27.178
I wish the best for Kamil and
Caitlin post Paradise.

32:27.245 --> 32:31.249
I just know Kamil
has wandering eyes.

32:31.316 --> 32:33.818
He flat out told me, like when
I took him on a date,

32:33.885 --> 32:35.987
that he was gonna go for
Caitlin. And that's what's

32:36.054 --> 32:38.623
happening, but like, why would
your eyes wander?

32:38.690 --> 32:43.227
I don't want to step on any
toes, especially with Caitlin.

32:43.294 --> 32:46.030
You can tell there's
tension there.

32:46.097 --> 32:49.667
I don't know what the beef
is between us.

32:49.734 --> 32:52.303
I want to get to the bottom of
it, but at the end of the day,

32:52.370 --> 32:54.172
there's only so
much I can do.

32:54.238 --> 32:56.374
She's gonna
literally attack me.

32:56.441 --> 32:57.976
She already doesn't like you
for no reason.

32:58.042 --> 33:00.278
She does not like me for,
I don't even know why.

33:02.747 --> 33:04.282
I'm scared.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.201
Alright, what do
we have here?

33:23.267 --> 33:26.337
-
- Oh, oh!

33:26.404 --> 33:30.341
Should we chop some wood
and have a little fire?

33:30.408 --> 33:32.143
Alright, should we just do som--
a speed round?

33:32.210 --> 33:35.079
Yeah, absolutely.
Eugh, no pressure!

33:35.146 --> 33:38.049
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:38.116 --> 33:42.019
Yeah, I've got a big, burly
man to chop that wood and

33:42.086 --> 33:45.923
look sexy holding that axe,
and we're making s'mores.

33:45.990 --> 33:49.694
And, honey, does it
feel good.

33:51.429 --> 33:54.198
- There we go!
-

33:54.265 --> 33:57.869
- Oh.
- 10 out of 10 impressed.

33:57.935 --> 34:02.940
Mike, what do you do, for work,
that you're so good with an axe?

34:03.007 --> 34:06.210
Serial killer. Don't tell
too many people, Stacy.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.349
I think Mike's
just so funny.

34:11.416 --> 34:14.952
I think he looks sexy.
Honey!

34:15.019 --> 34:16.721
Oh, lord help us.

34:16.788 --> 34:19.223
Okay, give ́er.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.826
Yeah!

34:21.893 --> 34:23.795
Yeah, that was awesome!

34:23.861 --> 34:26.297
She nailed that wood.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.065
She knows what she wants.

34:28.132 --> 34:31.068
She doesn't give up.
She keeps going.

34:33.271 --> 34:38.843
Stacy and I never got an
opportunity to be together...

34:38.910 --> 34:40.445
with just us together.

34:40.511 --> 34:43.514
And, having those
meaningful conversations.

34:43.581 --> 34:47.051
And, we have now.

34:47.118 --> 34:49.987
- First day in Paradise...
- Yeah.

34:50.054 --> 34:52.190
- Should we cheers to something?
- Hm, yeah.

34:52.256 --> 34:57.428
Continuing where we left off.
And, seeing where it goes.

34:57.495 --> 35:01.199
And enjoying Paradise,
whatever...

35:01.265 --> 35:03.034
that ends up being for us.

35:05.002 --> 35:07.371
- Paradiso.
- What's that?

35:07.438 --> 35:10.975
- Paradise.
- Oh.

35:11.042 --> 35:14.412
- Oh, it's nice out, huh?
- Buddy, she's sunny.

35:14.479 --> 35:16.514
That's Paradise.
How do you spell Paradise?

35:16.581 --> 35:18.783
L-O-V-E, baby.
How are you doing?

35:18.850 --> 35:20.351
Buddy, are you kidding me?

35:20.418 --> 35:22.854
I feel like I'm the only one
that's not in any kind of drama.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.889
Vay's cool, man.
She's purdy, man.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.958
She's cool and she's smart
and she's fun.

35:27.024 --> 35:29.494
It's just, it's easy.
I don't have to do anything.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.796
- I don't have to try.
- Yeah, ́cause you're in love.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.297
́Cause you're in love.

35:33.364 --> 35:34.465
I want what you have.

35:34.532 --> 35:35.967
Are you gonna invite me
to the wedding?

35:39.103 --> 35:41.506
This feels like a
quiet night tonight.

35:41.572 --> 35:46.077
Calm before the storm.
Are you ready for a storm?

35:46.143 --> 35:48.813
A lot of people say that
you can't read me.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.314
The dark hair and the
light eyes, it's like...

35:50.381 --> 35:53.050
- Very mysterious.
- I actually think I can.

35:53.117 --> 35:54.452
- No, you can't.
- I think I can.

35:54.519 --> 35:55.553
- How?
- But that's fine.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.421
Tell me.
You can't read me.

35:57.488 --> 35:59.023
You wish you could,
but once you-

35:59.090 --> 36:02.193
I think, I think I
have you figured out.

36:02.260 --> 36:05.263
- I don't think so.
- Okay, we'll see.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.135
- Well, where's your cowboy?
- I don't know.

36:11.202 --> 36:15.106
To... picking out that rope
and saddle you in?

36:15.172 --> 36:18.543
What are those- why- why do
you always comment like that?

36:18.609 --> 36:20.878
I don't know, 'cause I see
you guys vibing and,

36:20.945 --> 36:27.418
I see his personality and the
way he carries himself so...

36:27.485 --> 36:30.922
I know in real life you
wouldn't go for him.

36:30.988 --> 36:34.892
Seeing Vay go from me to
space cowboy, Joey,

36:34.959 --> 36:38.262
it was a bit of a shock to me,
you know, like...

36:38.329 --> 36:40.264
She told me, like, I'm her type.

36:40.331 --> 36:43.367
I, I have everything that
she's looking for in a man,

36:43.434 --> 36:44.402
and then...

36:44.468 --> 36:47.605
literally the next day she
goes to cowboy Joey.

36:47.672 --> 36:50.474
You found, you found
a guy that's a rodeo?

36:50.541 --> 36:53.210
Like, what happened?

36:53.277 --> 36:58.916
When he, like, takes shots at
Joey, my overthinking brain...

36:58.983 --> 37:03.154
is reading him, like he's still
interested in me.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.388
And I don't want to
tell you who to date,

37:04.455 --> 37:05.656
but I'm just saying-

37:05.723 --> 37:10.027
- You don't see me with him.
- I don't.

37:10.094 --> 37:13.130
Who would you see me with?

37:13.197 --> 37:15.366
No one that's available
right now.

37:17.468 --> 37:21.205
It is very early. Like,
nothing's set in concrete.

37:21.272 --> 37:25.309
- For some of us.
- For most of us.

37:25.376 --> 37:28.512
I look over and I can't help
but notice Vay and Kamil

37:28.579 --> 37:30.514
are sitting at the bar.

37:30.581 --> 37:35.486
And I don't like watching
her with him, at all.

37:35.553 --> 37:36.687
I see it happening.

37:36.754 --> 37:39.223
Yeah, it's like not
okay right now.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.458
Just be okay.

37:40.524 --> 37:42.927
It's just so petty
and immature.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.662
But that's not you.

37:47.632 --> 37:50.568
Vay and I don't have
a very, like,

37:50.635 --> 37:53.170
chummy relationship back home.

37:53.237 --> 37:55.473
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

37:55.539 --> 37:58.242
But like, why can't he just
like walk away from her?

38:01.345 --> 38:03.547
I don't want her to ruin
your experience of Paradise.

38:03.614 --> 38:04.682
She's not, she's not.

38:04.749 --> 38:06.617
Like, I'm a very,
very strong person.

38:06.684 --> 38:09.153
Like I said, I don't need
everyone in life to like me.

38:09.220 --> 38:12.089
- But like, it is bothersome.
- No, I get, I get it.

38:12.156 --> 38:14.225
I'm exhausted. Like,
and this is just here.

38:14.291 --> 38:15.993
Like, at home,
I'm exhausted.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.729
Like, and I know for a fact I
never did anything to that girl.

38:18.796 --> 38:23.601
Like, I'm just- It's like, how
much more do I need to do?

38:23.668 --> 38:28.272
Oh, my God.
I can't stand her.

38:28.339 --> 38:30.341
It's just like typical
mean girl shit.

38:30.408 --> 38:33.377
Like, don't go for my guy when
you've got a problem with me.

38:33.444 --> 38:35.446
No, no,
she's baiting you, dude.

38:35.513 --> 38:38.049
Seeing, you know, her having
a conversation with Kamil

38:38.115 --> 38:39.317
is really frustrating me.

38:39.383 --> 38:42.386
́Cause he doesn't need to be
involved in any of that and

38:42.453 --> 38:47.491
frankly, like, I, I don't
need her in any part of

38:47.558 --> 38:49.293
my relationship
with Kamil anymore.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.329
You guys should just
like figure it out.

38:51.395 --> 38:55.299
Yeah. Thanks,
thanks for the pep talk.

38:55.366 --> 38:58.169
- Thanks.
- It's too quiet out here.

38:58.235 --> 38:59.437
Like, Paradise is
never like that.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.038
There's always a storm
rolling in.

39:09.914 --> 39:12.550
♪ YOU KNOW SOMETIMES
I JUST WANT ♪

39:12.616 --> 39:15.419
♪ TO HOLD YOU CLOSE...

39:15.486 --> 39:17.955

marshmallow?

39:18.022 --> 39:20.991
I'm probably just gonna
stick it in there.

39:21.058 --> 39:22.993
- Stick it in there and see-
- And see what happens.

39:23.060 --> 39:25.696

39:29.233 --> 39:34.905
I let it simmer in

The key to making a good

39:38.042 --> 39:39.543

DON'T HOLD BACK. ♪

39:42.012 --> 39:43.748

39:47.618 --> 39:48.753
- You're on fire!
- It's okay!

39:48.819 --> 39:51.756
- You're on fire!
- I'm in trouble.

39:51.822 --> 39:54.859
My marshmallow is beautiful,
and bronzed,

39:54.925 --> 39:57.495
and brown, and delicious.

40:03.968 --> 40:06.170
Stacy!

40:06.237 --> 40:07.638
Stacy, what are you doing?

40:07.705 --> 40:09.507
I don't know!

40:09.573 --> 40:13.077
-
- Mm!

40:13.144 --> 40:17.114
- This isn't how I normally eat.
- Are you sure?

40:17.181 --> 40:20.818
- Well, with other people.
-

40:20.885 --> 40:23.053
Ah...

40:33.564 --> 40:36.967
So, why, why did you pick me?

40:37.034 --> 40:42.106
In a world full of fakeness
and negativity,

40:42.173 --> 40:43.674
you're a shining
light in that.

40:43.741 --> 40:46.644
And I really appreciate that.

40:46.710 --> 40:51.649
She just has this energy that...

40:51.715 --> 40:53.083
attracts me.

41:14.805 --> 41:17.274
Caitlin.
Just sit for a little bit.

41:17.341 --> 41:19.076
I want to talk to you.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.978
You seem very off
edge right now.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.880
Yeah, I am.
Here's the thing.

41:22.947 --> 41:25.916
If Vay wants to be a big girl,
then she can come over and

41:25.983 --> 41:26.784
have a conversation with me.

41:26.851 --> 41:28.953
You shouldn't have
been brought into

41:29.019 --> 41:30.721
whatever issue she's got
in the first place.

41:30.788 --> 41:32.089
- That's what annoys me.
- Right.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.791
- I know, but I was there.
- It's not a you problem.

41:33.858 --> 41:36.193
- But I'm already there.
- So, walk away.

41:36.260 --> 41:39.096
I want to be able to explain
where my feelings are at and

41:39.163 --> 41:40.998
where my emotions are
at to Kamil,

41:41.065 --> 41:43.100
and let him know that I
was uncomfortable

41:43.167 --> 41:45.836
with that whole
conversation.

41:45.903 --> 41:49.106
With Vay, why even sit there
and listen to it?

41:49.173 --> 41:51.609
It's something that she
needs to discuss with me.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.777
You know, I, I'm
a grown woman.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.680
I'm more than happy to
have a conversation.

41:56.747 --> 42:00.217
He doesn't need to be pulled
into the middle of that.

42:00.284 --> 42:02.019
- Talk to her about it.
- Yeah.

42:02.086 --> 42:04.154
Exactly.
And straighten it out.

42:04.221 --> 42:07.157
He keeps making comments
about Joey that's like,

42:07.224 --> 42:09.660
mind [beep]ing me,
and I'm like...

42:09.727 --> 42:13.764
And I'm trying to like not
let it, like, confuse me.

42:13.831 --> 42:16.934
But like, I don't understand
why he's doing that.

42:17.001 --> 42:18.369
Like, he keeps making
comments about like,

42:18.435 --> 42:20.004
"Yeah, like,
you're picking a cowboy.

42:20.070 --> 42:22.740
Yeah, like, hm, doesn't seem
like you're happy".

42:22.806 --> 42:24.241
And he keeps saying,
"It's early, it's early".

42:24.308 --> 42:25.843
It seems that you like Joey.

42:25.910 --> 42:29.079
I do, but like, he isn't the
type of guy that I go for.

42:29.146 --> 42:32.182
And like, when someone's there
and he's like literally

42:32.249 --> 42:35.819
reminding me that he's not the
type of guy I usually go for,

42:35.886 --> 42:39.256
I start to be like, okay,
why are you saying this?

42:39.323 --> 42:42.726
Like, why are you trying to,
like, cloud my, like, judgement?

42:42.793 --> 42:44.161
Like, it's weird, no?

42:44.228 --> 42:46.697
Kamil, man I think,
you know, he's experienced.

42:46.764 --> 42:49.233
He's just sitting back
letting it all happen.

42:49.300 --> 42:53.404
He maybe had feelings for Vay,
but he's secure with Caitlin.

42:53.470 --> 42:55.639
So, I don't see what he
could be doing

42:55.706 --> 42:58.309
except for stirring the pot.

42:58.375 --> 43:01.278
I think he's just trying to get
you confused. He's trying--

43:01.345 --> 43:03.347
- Well, it's, it's-
- It's working.

43:03.414 --> 43:04.982
Yo, I'm starting to think
like everything

43:05.049 --> 43:07.751
he's doing is
like calculated.

43:15.125 --> 43:19.330
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

43:19.396 --> 43:21.966
- Joey.
- Am I gonna be mad?

43:22.032 --> 43:25.970
No, but you're not
gonna be happy.

43:26.036 --> 43:28.939
- It's too quiet tonight.
- Well, yeah.

43:29.006 --> 43:31.942
It's quiet and relaxing.

43:32.009 --> 43:34.878
I got my boy's
back all the way.

43:34.945 --> 43:37.948
So, I have to tell my man Joey,
your girl is a little bit

43:38.015 --> 43:40.751
confused, so you need to like,
at least squash it,

43:40.818 --> 43:43.787
or at least settle it or see
what's going on for yourself.

43:43.854 --> 43:47.758
Vay had a talk with Kamil,
and Kamil was taking,

43:47.825 --> 43:50.427
little, you know, little jabs
at the relationship

43:50.494 --> 43:51.929
between you and Vay.

43:51.996 --> 43:54.898
Talking about how you're
really not her type.

43:54.965 --> 43:57.067
You're a cowboy and you're
not the kind of guy that

43:57.134 --> 44:00.004
she would go for.

44:00.070 --> 44:04.475
How he made it seem,
supposedly, was that...

44:04.541 --> 44:08.245
you know, it was Paradise.
And, you know, she should keep-

44:08.312 --> 44:09.847
I'm gonna show him
Paradise.

44:09.913 --> 44:13.384
Yeah, she should keep
her options open.

44:13.450 --> 44:15.252
I told her that I thought
that maybe he was

44:15.319 --> 44:16.754
trying to stir the pot.

44:16.820 --> 44:18.956
No shit! What the
else is he doing?

44:19.023 --> 44:20.090
I don't know.

44:20.157 --> 44:23.160
Pfft, oooh, shit!

44:23.227 --> 44:27.064
I am the most easy going guy
you'll meet, until I'm not.

44:27.131 --> 44:30.434
And that only flips...

44:30.501 --> 44:33.504
when you mess with people that
I genuinely care about.

44:33.570 --> 44:35.939
- Vay's a smart girl.
- Yeah.

44:36.006 --> 44:38.809
His business with me and her
is none of his business.

44:38.876 --> 44:40.210
Little snake.

44:40.277 --> 44:41.412
She's kind of stirred up
about it,

44:41.512 --> 44:43.247
and I know I see you- I see it
in your eyes right now.

44:43.313 --> 44:46.450
- Oh, I'm gonna kill him.
- Talk with him.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.218
- I don't want to hurt him, man.
- Don't hurt him, man.

44:48.285 --> 44:50.187
He should keep his
business to himself.

44:50.254 --> 44:51.188
That's it.

44:51.255 --> 44:55.426
Not a chance this guy's
getting away scot free.

44:55.492 --> 44:57.194
You have to talk to him, and
you have to use your words,

44:57.261 --> 44:58.462
and you have to just...

44:58.529 --> 45:01.432
squash it 'cause she was very
confused after the conversation.

45:01.498 --> 45:03.200
- Okay, cool.
- Okay?

45:03.267 --> 45:04.868
No, hang on, hang on.
I'm gonna do that.

45:09.206 --> 45:11.208
If you gotta talk to Vay about
something between me and her,

45:11.275 --> 45:12.776
you come up and you talk to me.

45:12.843 --> 45:13.844
What are you talking about?

45:13.911 --> 45:15.345
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't play stupid.

45:21.785 --> 45:24.354
If you gotta talk to Vay about
something between me and her,

45:24.421 --> 45:26.323
you come up and you
talk to me. Cool?

45:26.390 --> 45:27.391
What are you talking about?

45:27.458 --> 45:29.693
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't play stupid.

45:29.760 --> 45:32.830
- What did you start?
- No, I didn't start anything.

45:32.896 --> 45:35.799
I'm like, just tell him not to
go to Vay and to go to you

45:35.866 --> 45:38.235
instead if he has something
to say about you.

45:38.302 --> 45:40.104
Come up to me- be a man-

45:40.170 --> 45:41.305
come up to me and talk
to me about it.

45:41.371 --> 45:42.272
I am a man, what are
you talking about?

45:42.339 --> 45:44.208
Now you're just, you're just
doing this-

45:44.274 --> 45:46.810
The maturity levels tonight,
what is going on?

45:46.877 --> 45:49.680
I don't have anything to say.
Bro, I don't have an issue.

45:49.746 --> 45:52.416
Whatever makes her happy,
whatever makes you happy...

45:52.483 --> 45:53.650
I really don't have an issue.

45:53.717 --> 45:56.353
I don't care if you're a
space cowboy or

45:56.420 --> 45:59.823
a space whatever you are.
Like, I don't care.

45:59.890 --> 46:01.492
Buddy, don't start chirping.

46:01.558 --> 46:03.727
There's nothing
between me and Vay.

46:03.794 --> 46:05.362
Didn't say there was.

46:05.429 --> 46:07.631
I have issues about
you coming up,

46:07.698 --> 46:08.866
saying the shit
that you're saying.

46:08.932 --> 46:11.835
And what did I say?
Repeat it, please.

46:11.902 --> 46:14.538
Okay, talking to her about how,
you know what,

46:14.605 --> 46:15.839
"I think you should really
explore things.

46:15.906 --> 46:17.875
Joey's not your type.
Oh, this cowboy,

46:17.941 --> 46:19.276
you should definitely stay
away from that.

46:19.343 --> 46:20.777
You know who's
more your type,

46:20.844 --> 46:23.580
maybe someone more like me".
- Oh, my- right.

46:23.647 --> 46:25.182
Maybe you should stay
away from that.

46:25.249 --> 46:27.151
Vay needs to be communicating
a little bit better.

46:27.217 --> 46:28.185
Sorry- I'm not talking to
you right now, Caitlin.

46:28.252 --> 46:29.586
And she's saying the same
thing about Caitlin.

46:29.653 --> 46:32.189
Do whatever you want.
If... if he's your,

46:32.256 --> 46:33.791
if he's your guy,
talk to her.

46:33.857 --> 46:35.259
But then why even
say that, bro, like...?

46:35.325 --> 46:36.693
Bro, I'm not making
her second guess anything.

46:36.760 --> 46:39.329
- Why even talk to her then?
- ́Cause she was there!

46:39.396 --> 46:42.566
You okay?
...What's going on?

46:42.633 --> 46:45.702
I don't know, just like
so much unnecessary...

46:45.769 --> 46:47.404
drama this evening.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.640
I don't know, apparently Vay
was going on about

46:49.706 --> 46:51.842
some shit over here.

46:51.909 --> 46:54.211
What's Joey saying?

46:54.278 --> 46:58.215
Apparently Kamil said
something to Vay about...

46:58.282 --> 47:02.586
him and her- Joey and Vay.
I don't know.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.221
I know the type of
girl she is,

47:04.288 --> 47:05.489
and you guys have
something good.

47:05.556 --> 47:06.690
Good for you guys.

47:06.757 --> 47:07.958
But then why did you even bring
me into the conversation?

47:08.025 --> 47:11.395
Why did you even say, "You know
what, how's things with Joey?"

47:11.461 --> 47:13.564
- "What do you think about him""
- Why not? Why not?

47:13.630 --> 47:15.332
́Cause everyone here
wants to find out

47:15.399 --> 47:16.800
about every single
relationship.

47:16.867 --> 47:18.435
But then why did you start
chirping shit into her ear?

47:18.502 --> 47:21.605
I didn't chirp anything.

47:21.672 --> 47:25.742
In this scenario, you have a
stud horse in the pasture...

47:25.809 --> 47:27.344
and you've got a mare.

47:28.545 --> 47:31.448
And there's a coyote on the
outskirts just trying to

47:31.515 --> 47:33.750
come in and nip some heels,
scaring the mare,

47:33.817 --> 47:36.186
and she keeps running off.

47:36.253 --> 47:38.422
And that stud's gonna
come through.

47:38.488 --> 47:39.856
And I'll tell you what's
gonna be left of

47:39.923 --> 47:42.326
the face of the coyote...

47:42.392 --> 47:43.594
not so much.

47:56.006 --> 47:57.674
Like, what do you
want from me, like...

47:57.741 --> 47:58.742
obviously, it's true.

47:58.809 --> 48:02.312
Like, you're not the guy that
she would go for,

48:02.379 --> 48:04.548
in the real world.

48:04.615 --> 48:06.383
I don't know if I can say this
́cause I'm pretty sure I might

48:06.450 --> 48:08.785
go to prison for death threats,
but like, I'll kill him.

48:10.821 --> 48:12.756
Don't mess with my people.

48:12.823 --> 48:14.558
What did you say?

48:14.625 --> 48:15.826
Well, I just- he told me
what was going on,

48:15.893 --> 48:17.294
so I went over and
I asked him about it.

48:17.361 --> 48:18.562
He was just like
with my head.

48:18.629 --> 48:22.332
I didn't want to start drama.
Do I have to go talk to Caitlin?

48:22.399 --> 48:24.501
You don't have to.

48:24.568 --> 48:25.936
I can walk you there,
if you'd like.

48:26.003 --> 48:27.604
- Can we all walk together?
- Yes.

48:27.671 --> 48:28.839
And then I'll decide
what I want to do.

48:28.905 --> 48:30.741
Want to come?

48:30.807 --> 48:32.609
Can I have a glass of water,
please?

48:32.676 --> 48:34.678
If Caitlin doesn't want to
be friends with me,

48:34.745 --> 48:36.546
that's her choice. But,

48:36.613 --> 48:39.316
if I did something to someone,
I would love to know.

48:39.383 --> 48:41.685
Go on the bean bags together.
We'll hold hands too.

48:41.752 --> 48:43.987
Oh, okay.

48:44.054 --> 48:45.889
- Do you want to go talk?
- Sure.

48:47.791 --> 48:49.593
Alright, let's just do this.

48:51.662 --> 48:53.397
It's hard to read
Caitlin on it, too.

48:53.463 --> 48:56.266
́Cause like, even like Vay and
I were talking today and,

48:56.333 --> 48:58.402
obviously, I don't know what
happened with them

48:58.468 --> 49:00.404
outside of this, but like
I really like Caitlin,

49:00.470 --> 49:03.940
but she's been the one that's
like not talking as much to,

49:04.007 --> 49:06.510
to other people.

49:06.576 --> 49:07.911
I know there's been tension
between us for

49:07.978 --> 49:10.947
a very, very long time.
I don't understand why.

49:11.014 --> 49:12.949
We just don't mesh,
we don't mesh, that's fine.

49:13.016 --> 49:13.951
Right.

49:14.017 --> 49:16.286
I don't think there's a
particular thing that

49:16.353 --> 49:20.290
happened between us.
If I did anything to you...

49:20.357 --> 49:22.993
I would love to know.

49:23.060 --> 49:24.127
- So, my-
- Like, I'm shaking.

49:24.194 --> 49:29.433
So, my issue now is that
you've been talking to like

49:29.499 --> 49:31.668
my guy instead of
just addressing me.

49:31.735 --> 49:33.003
Well, I just addressed you.
It was like literally like-

49:33.070 --> 49:35.005
No, but you're addressing me
after the fact.

49:35.072 --> 49:37.407
I needed the support
from people for-

49:37.474 --> 49:40.077
You don't need support though to
have a conversation with me.

49:40.143 --> 49:41.578
Like, I'm here and
I'm listening.

49:41.645 --> 49:44.414
I want to lend an ear and
I'm sorry-

49:44.481 --> 49:47.351
You know, seeing you come in
when I was like

49:47.417 --> 49:49.686
really feeling Kamil,
like right off the bat.

49:49.753 --> 49:50.887
I wish I would have known.

49:50.954 --> 49:53.357
It's like the world just
blew up in my face.

49:53.423 --> 49:54.591
I wish you would have
taken me aside.

49:54.658 --> 49:57.494
And I was back to that Paradise
moment I've already been in.

49:57.561 --> 50:00.964
And now I have to
compete with my colleague.

50:01.031 --> 50:05.836
Like, I didn't respect like, the
way that a lot of, you know,

50:05.902 --> 50:08.105
situations have been
handled in the workplace.

50:08.171 --> 50:12.442
And that's, I think, where a
lot of my kind of like

50:12.509 --> 50:14.778
negative energy comes from.
And like, it's like I've just

50:14.845 --> 50:17.681
been pushing down feelings
this entire time.

50:17.748 --> 50:19.349
And like, I don't want
to go through this

50:19.416 --> 50:21.485
entire experience
feeling that way.

50:21.551 --> 50:23.553
Like, we still- we have the
roses this week.

50:23.620 --> 50:25.088
We should be happy
and feeling good.

50:25.155 --> 50:28.825
Like, I want us both to be able
to have a happy time here and

50:28.892 --> 50:30.627
find our person.

50:42.973 --> 50:44.941
I'm enjoying my time,
my alone time with

50:45.008 --> 50:46.777
the girl that I'm here for.

50:46.843 --> 50:49.713
And, he's trying to like
offset it and create problems.

50:49.780 --> 50:51.848
What are you doing, man?
Like, leave me alone.

50:51.915 --> 50:53.650
If you want to talk to me,
face-to-face, like,

50:53.717 --> 50:55.786
don't talk to me when
my girl is around.

50:55.852 --> 50:56.586
You know you have
something good.

50:56.653 --> 50:58.855
He knows you have
something good.

50:58.922 --> 51:00.390
Why is he even trying
to go there?

51:00.457 --> 51:01.825
I was cool, and calm,
and collected.

51:01.892 --> 51:03.727
Like, he was the one
that came at me, so...

51:03.794 --> 51:06.096
- Yeah.
- Whatever.

51:06.163 --> 51:08.532
I have this much respect for
him. I'm not gonna talk to him

51:08.598 --> 51:09.466
for the rest of the time
that he's here.

51:09.533 --> 51:10.267
If he tries to talk
to me, but like,

51:10.333 --> 51:13.603
no, forget about it.
Don't care.

51:13.670 --> 51:15.605
He's a piece of shit,
to be honest with you. Yeah.

51:15.672 --> 51:17.607
Kamil might as well be
a bullseye.

51:22.479 --> 51:24.848
He don't want this smoke,
but I'm coming.

51:24.915 --> 51:27.851
I'm in not any way
threatened my him, you know.

51:27.918 --> 51:29.052
And I don't want to be
caught up in some

51:29.119 --> 51:31.888
cowboy triangle.

51:34.591 --> 51:35.525
<i>Coming up...</i>

51:35.592 --> 51:36.760
- What's your name?
- Josh.

51:36.827 --> 51:37.561
Oh, it's a new guy.

51:37.627 --> 51:38.695
How many guys
are gonna be here?

51:38.762 --> 51:40.063
What are you looking for?

51:40.130 --> 51:41.097
This guy's hot.

51:41.164 --> 51:43.800
They're spinning.
Unpredictable, these women.

51:43.867 --> 51:45.202
We should go this way.

51:45.268 --> 51:46.503
<i>And then...</i>

51:46.570 --> 51:48.438
Uh-oh, trouble in Paradise.

51:48.505 --> 51:50.040
You know, I definitely have
feelings for Angela.

51:50.106 --> 51:52.108
And then, I also have these
feelings for you too.

51:52.175 --> 51:54.044
Like, it's bullshit.
I'm annoyed.

51:54.110 --> 51:56.012
I'm freaking the out
right now.

51:56.079 --> 51:59.549
Brendan M. doesn't need my
permission to talk to Stacy.

51:59.616 --> 52:01.117
But, like, I feel disrespected.

52:01.184 --> 52:02.986
Like, I feel like he's
making me look stupid.

52:04.888 --> 52:07.023
Nm-mm.

52:07.090 --> 52:08.425
I don't play that game.

52:22.906 --> 52:25.775
- Hi, bebe. Girl chat.
- Girl chat.

52:25.842 --> 52:28.778
Did you guys get a chance to
talk to the new guys at all?

52:28.845 --> 52:33.283
I talked to Mike, briefly.
And I haven't talked to Alex.

52:33.350 --> 52:36.086
At all, but he's hot.

52:36.152 --> 52:38.321
I think we can all agree...

52:38.388 --> 52:41.057
His looks are, yeah.

52:41.124 --> 52:43.860
Things is Paradise have
not changed for me.

52:43.927 --> 52:46.263
You know, you think you're
going into the week with power,

52:46.329 --> 52:48.331
and you know, people gotta
start kissing your ass,

52:48.398 --> 52:50.066
nobody's kissing my ass.

52:50.133 --> 52:52.269
I feel like I wasted my time
explaining to them

52:52.335 --> 52:54.371
what other people were doing
and then, suddenly,

52:54.437 --> 52:55.505
the time was like over.

52:55.572 --> 52:58.808
I really, really, really
hope a new guy comes today.

52:58.875 --> 53:01.811
If a new guy comes in today,
talk about Lisa.

53:01.878 --> 53:04.080
Oh, yeah, just like,
I don't know them.

53:04.147 --> 53:06.216
This is Paradise for us.
It's an island.

53:06.283 --> 53:07.851
I mean, ́cause literally
anything can change

53:07.918 --> 53:10.220
at the drop of a hat.

53:12.489 --> 53:14.958
- Hello.
- What's up? Want to talk?

53:15.025 --> 53:16.493
You want to talk?
Let's do it.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.195
I want to hear
about your night.

53:18.261 --> 53:19.930
- What's that?
I want to hear about your night.

53:19.996 --> 53:23.066
Yeah! It was a night,
it was a night.

53:23.133 --> 53:26.369
- Yeah?
-

53:26.436 --> 53:28.572
- How you doing?
- Good, how are you?

53:28.638 --> 53:30.874
- I'm good.
- Where's your head at?

53:30.941 --> 53:34.144
My head? It's in a little
bit of an interesting space.

53:34.210 --> 53:37.514
I'm really confused about my
relationship with Angela

53:37.581 --> 53:40.050
'cause I, I definitely...

53:40.116 --> 53:42.052
you know, I definitely have
feelings for Angela.

53:42.118 --> 53:44.988
And then, I also have these
feelings for you too.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.224
I don't want my cake and I
don't wan to eat it too.

53:47.290 --> 53:48.625
I don't, I don't.

53:48.692 --> 53:52.596
But, I don't want to end up
like Brendan S.

53:52.662 --> 53:56.933
and Illeana, attached by the-
like, by the hip, you know?

53:57.000 --> 53:59.135
I don't want that situation.

53:59.202 --> 54:03.640
It's important to not just get,
you know, I guess...

54:03.707 --> 54:05.875
tunnel vision for one person.
- Mhm.

54:05.942 --> 54:07.110
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:07.177 --> 54:11.281
Until you know, like,
there's no point of...

54:11.348 --> 54:14.284
being closed off to other
people, you know?

54:14.351 --> 54:15.952
Yeah, it's not really like that,
you know,

54:16.019 --> 54:17.320
and it shouldn't be like that.
- Yeah.

54:17.387 --> 54:20.156
- Pull another bean bag?
- Yeah, I'll grab it.

54:20.223 --> 54:23.393
Brendan is spending all
morning with Stacy.

54:23.460 --> 54:27.297
Yeah, I am a little bit
confused.

54:29.132 --> 54:30.333
Okay, yeah, talk to me.

54:30.400 --> 54:32.102
Let me know more
about this trip.

54:32.168 --> 54:34.204
Okay, I didn't know--
I knew I didn't--

54:35.105 --> 54:36.539
I'm just like...

54:44.314 --> 54:47.250
Like, it's bullshit.
I'm annoyed.

54:47.317 --> 54:50.320
I mean, on the daybed, too,
like, that's what I don't like.

54:50.387 --> 54:51.955
- And he took his shirt off.
- And the shirt's off.

54:52.022 --> 54:55.125
I'm about to like scream.

54:55.191 --> 54:59.029
Brendan M. doesn't need my
permission to talk to Stacy.

54:59.095 --> 55:01.131
He's a grown man, he can
talk to who he wants.

55:01.197 --> 55:03.133
But like, I feel disrespected.

55:03.199 --> 55:05.201
Like, I feel like he's
making me look stupid.

55:05.268 --> 55:10.140
Nm-mm. I don't
play that game.

55:10.206 --> 55:13.677
Uh-oh, trouble in Paradise.

55:13.743 --> 55:16.279
Hi, friends.

55:16.346 --> 55:17.547
I think a storm's
rolling in.

55:17.614 --> 55:19.149
I know.

55:28.058 --> 55:30.093
Oh, it's a new guy.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.995
This is a new muscle guy.

55:32.062 --> 55:33.296
How many guys
are gonna be here?

55:33.363 --> 55:35.498
- Josh.
- Plot twist.

55:35.565 --> 55:38.301
All the surprises
in Paradise.

55:38.368 --> 55:41.471
I'm Josh, 28.
I'm from Vancouver, BC.

55:41.538 --> 55:43.673
This is my first time doing
anything Bachelor,

55:43.740 --> 55:45.442
and I'm crazy excited.

55:45.508 --> 55:46.543
- What's your name?
- Josh.

55:46.609 --> 55:48.278
Josh, I'm Angela.

55:48.344 --> 55:49.279
Nice to meet you.

55:49.346 --> 55:51.681
Josh is totally my type.

55:51.748 --> 55:54.684
He caught my eye,
I'm not gonna lie.

55:54.751 --> 55:56.720
No, I don't think he
had a date card!

55:56.786 --> 55:57.654
I really don't think he
had a date card.

55:57.721 --> 55:59.756
He wasn't holding anything,
so I wonder...

55:59.823 --> 56:01.591
- Maybe it's in his pocket.
- Yeah, I wonder...

56:01.658 --> 56:04.461
This is where the girls
ponder where their roses

56:04.527 --> 56:07.097
are going to now.

56:07.163 --> 56:09.165
They're not looking at us.
Ignoring.

56:09.232 --> 56:11.134
I know,
what happened?

56:11.201 --> 56:14.070
Their heads are spinning.
Unpredictable, these women.

56:14.137 --> 56:15.338
Yeah.

56:15.405 --> 56:17.273
We should go this way.

56:17.340 --> 56:19.709
Lisa! Give it a minute!

56:19.776 --> 56:20.477
- It's over.
- It's over.

56:20.543 --> 56:22.278
- Forget about it.
-

56:22.345 --> 56:24.647
Forget about it.

56:24.714 --> 56:26.282
I work mostly in music videos.

56:26.349 --> 56:27.584
- Oh, sick.
- And commercials.

56:27.650 --> 56:29.085
What about you?
What do you do?

56:29.152 --> 56:31.421
- I am a professional cosplayer.
- Whoa!

56:31.488 --> 56:33.490
Okay, you gotta fill me
on how this works.

56:33.556 --> 56:36.493
Big internet following,
get paid to guest at cons.

56:36.559 --> 56:38.628
Like, people pay to see
my digital content.

56:38.695 --> 56:41.097
I just think it's really cool
that you just like found

56:41.164 --> 56:44.200
something you loved and
made a life out of it.

56:44.267 --> 56:45.802
He paid me a
compliment and like,

56:45.869 --> 56:48.171
that's the closest thing to
anything I've had here.

56:48.238 --> 56:50.206
And it honestly felt good to
have somebody acknowledge me

56:50.273 --> 56:51.508
here in a positive way.

56:51.574 --> 56:54.711
When I was like 16, I was
like super nerdy and

56:54.778 --> 56:56.613
I loved making light
saber videos.

56:56.679 --> 56:58.515
Shut up, I love Star Wars.

56:58.581 --> 57:00.350
I'm a big Star Wars fan, too.

57:00.416 --> 57:03.086
Lisa, honestly, she's doing
what she loves.

57:03.153 --> 57:04.788
And I actually really respect
that in a person.

57:04.854 --> 57:07.423
My ideal woman is...

57:07.490 --> 57:08.358
someone that I
just vibe with,

57:08.425 --> 57:10.059
that's kind of on the
same level as me.

57:10.126 --> 57:11.795
And someone that also loves
to be creative and

57:11.861 --> 57:14.197
expresses themself
in some sort of way.

57:14.264 --> 57:15.131
Appreciate you.

57:15.198 --> 57:16.266
It's been a pleasure
getting to know you.

57:16.332 --> 57:17.734
Yeah!

57:17.801 --> 57:18.902
This guy's hot.

57:18.968 --> 57:22.806
New guy seems really nice.
We had a shit ton in common.

57:22.872 --> 57:24.374
You look happier, Lisa.

57:25.575 --> 57:28.311
Just, just keep your eyes on it.
Put a little pressure.

57:28.378 --> 57:30.380
- Are they gonna go sit down?
- Yeah.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.582
- Nervous?
- Nah, you're always nervous.

57:32.649 --> 57:33.616
What kind of modelling
do you do?

57:33.683 --> 57:35.251
- Ah, fitness.
- Yeah, me too.

57:35.318 --> 57:36.286
Yeah?

57:36.352 --> 57:38.688
There's a lot of guys that
are trying to prove

57:38.755 --> 57:41.224
to the women that they
deserve a rose.

57:42.625 --> 57:44.727
Like, let the best man win.

57:44.794 --> 57:46.196
Yo, Vay, I was actually
gonna see if you wanted to

57:46.262 --> 57:46.930
talk for a little bit.

57:46.996 --> 57:48.631
Yeah, sounds good.
Let's go.

57:48.698 --> 57:51.634
- There's too much heat.
- Too much competition.

57:51.701 --> 57:52.836
Ah, kidding me?

57:52.902 --> 57:54.604
Josh is a handsome,
good-looking fella.

57:54.671 --> 57:56.139
I tell you what...

57:58.208 --> 58:01.411
I mean, he's got everything
going, doesn't that guy, eh?

58:01.478 --> 58:03.813
Jealous boys.
A little bit, yes.

58:03.880 --> 58:07.250
- What are you stressed about?
- You!

58:07.317 --> 58:09.619
So, what are you here-
what are you looking for?

58:09.686 --> 58:12.355
-
- I put you on the spot.

58:12.422 --> 58:13.323
Yeah! You're asking me
the questions.

58:13.389 --> 58:14.224
I'm supposed to ask you
the questions, okay!

58:14.290 --> 58:17.360
Hey, things happen
quickly in Paradise.

58:17.427 --> 58:18.895
This point, I'm just
overwhelmed because

58:18.962 --> 58:20.864
this is a lot of
beautiful women.

58:20.930 --> 58:22.532
And, there's only one me.

58:22.599 --> 58:24.534
- How are you?
- I'm good, how are you?

58:24.601 --> 58:27.670
You have cute dimples.
You have good dimples.

58:27.737 --> 58:29.806
There's a lot of stuff going-
there's a lot of options.

58:29.873 --> 58:31.407
- Where are you from?
- I'm from...

58:31.474 --> 58:33.576
so, I live in America.
I live in South Carolina.

58:33.643 --> 58:34.577
Yes, I've heard of this place,
America.

58:34.644 --> 58:36.613
Yeah, what about you?
You from here, where?

58:36.679 --> 58:38.648
I'm from Canada.
I'm a filmmaker.

58:38.715 --> 58:41.684
And also, I'm a model and
I'm an actor as well.

58:41.751 --> 58:42.919
I also like working out a lot.

58:42.986 --> 58:45.355
I'm a fitness model, so like
it's a requirement of what I do.

58:45.421 --> 58:46.589
Well, I mean, I haven't seen
you with your shirt off yet,

58:46.656 --> 58:47.523
so I'll, you know...

58:47.590 --> 58:50.827
- Yeah, you have to...
- TBD.

58:50.894 --> 58:52.328
Angela seems really sweet.

58:52.395 --> 58:55.298
She's got, like,
a great personality.

58:55.365 --> 58:56.499
She's very beautiful.

58:56.566 --> 58:58.835
Give me a hug.
It was good talking to you.

58:58.902 --> 59:00.036
Absolutely.

59:00.103 --> 59:04.807
I wasn't expecting to be like,
attracted to the new guy.

59:04.874 --> 59:08.611
Yeah, what a turn
of events, y'all.

59:08.678 --> 59:10.780
So, as you guys know,
I have a date card.

59:10.847 --> 59:12.815
"Grab a date and bounce".

59:12.882 --> 59:15.351
Ah, I think Angela, I was gonna
see if you wanna,

59:15.418 --> 59:16.753
if you wanna bounce?

59:16.819 --> 59:18.488
- Yeah, sure.
- Alright, cool.

59:18.554 --> 59:20.723
- Let's bounce.
- Perfect, I'd love that. Okay.

59:20.790 --> 59:23.226
- Have fun!
- Bye, guys!

59:26.029 --> 59:28.498
Shot-skis?

59:28.565 --> 59:32.769
I thought we were vibing,
and then he picked Angela.

59:32.835 --> 59:35.338
I feel like I'm on The
Bachelor, but for best friends.

59:35.405 --> 59:36.906
Platonic best friends.

59:36.973 --> 59:38.441
- Let's take another one.
- Cheers.

59:38.508 --> 59:40.376
- Cheers!
- Tastes like nothing.

59:42.612 --> 59:44.380
I don't know what I'm missing
in every conversation

59:44.447 --> 59:46.616
I have with a guy.
We had a lot in common.

59:46.683 --> 59:49.485
- You're cut off.
- She's cut.

59:49.552 --> 59:50.987
I don't know, man.

59:51.054 --> 59:52.622
At this point, I'm just
YOLO-ing it.

1:00:00.029 --> 1:00:01.831
- Ready to jump in?
- Yeah, let's bounce.

1:00:05.902 --> 1:00:08.438
-
- Hoo!

1:00:08.504 --> 1:00:10.606
- Alright.
- Oh, wait.

1:00:10.673 --> 1:00:12.208
Alright, are we swimming?

1:00:12.275 --> 1:00:16.512
I would not have accepted the
date with Josh unless I felt

1:00:16.579 --> 1:00:19.916
like there could potentially be
like a spark there.

1:00:24.787 --> 1:00:26.055
Ah!

1:00:28.224 --> 1:00:30.827
Yeah, I mean, Josh,
Josh is looking good.

1:00:30.893 --> 1:00:33.062
But, man, he's a fitness model.

1:00:33.129 --> 1:00:36.566
I mean, I mean,
he's not bad to look at.

1:00:36.632 --> 1:00:39.669
He's, his body-

1:00:39.736 --> 1:00:40.870
I just think
it's attractive. Like,

1:00:40.937 --> 1:00:44.007
I want somebody who can, you
know, protect me if need be.

1:00:44.073 --> 1:00:47.043
Or just, you know, it's,
I just, I like his manliness.

1:00:47.110 --> 1:00:50.680
Like Josh is a man, you know?
And he's got that like...

1:00:50.747 --> 1:00:53.116
that something something
going on.

1:00:53.182 --> 1:00:54.617
The muscles.

1:00:58.221 --> 1:01:00.056
I'm done.

1:01:00.123 --> 1:01:02.158
Whoo!

1:01:02.225 --> 1:01:03.960
I'm scared.

1:01:04.027 --> 1:01:06.029
You got this.

1:01:06.095 --> 1:01:07.797
Oh, there it is, hold on!

1:01:07.864 --> 1:01:09.032
Ah!

1:01:09.098 --> 1:01:12.568
I almost didn't.

1:01:15.171 --> 1:01:18.207
She's just a beam
of positivity.

1:01:18.274 --> 1:01:20.743
She's great to be around.

1:01:20.810 --> 1:01:23.079
She finds the good in anything,
and I think in anybody,

1:01:23.146 --> 1:01:24.881
that's a great quality.

1:01:24.947 --> 1:01:28.284
That's important for me,
especially going forward.

1:01:29.919 --> 1:01:31.054
Whoa!

1:01:33.156 --> 1:01:35.792
Oh!

1:01:35.858 --> 1:01:37.293
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Yes.

1:01:42.265 --> 1:01:44.067
This is what you're
talking about!

1:01:44.133 --> 1:01:45.601
Agh!

1:01:45.668 --> 1:01:47.603
I'm really-
oh, here we go.

1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:53.209
My heart is pumping.

1:01:53.276 --> 1:01:54.577
Your makeup's really
holding up.

1:01:54.644 --> 1:01:56.679
Does it look okay?

1:01:56.746 --> 1:01:58.815
I don't think there's a
scenario where you couldn't.

1:01:58.881 --> 1:02:01.050
Stop, thank you.

1:02:01.117 --> 1:02:03.119
He knows how to, like,
be a gentleman and

1:02:03.186 --> 1:02:05.822
how to treat a lady and,
definitely, he's definitely

1:02:05.888 --> 1:02:09.058
proven that to me tonight,
so far.

1:02:09.125 --> 1:02:10.860
Yeah!

1:02:10.927 --> 1:02:13.596
Woo!

1:02:13.663 --> 1:02:15.098
Ah!

1:02:20.369 --> 1:02:22.205
I wish I was over
there with her.

1:02:22.271 --> 1:02:24.907
- Yeah.
- Mhm, so...

1:02:27.744 --> 1:02:30.880
I'm feeling a little caught
off guard. Like,

1:02:30.947 --> 1:02:34.984
seeing the person who you're
interested with someone else,

1:02:35.051 --> 1:02:37.887
you know, it can make you
feel a certain way.

1:02:37.954 --> 1:02:40.356
- What are our thoughts on that?
- It's a date.

1:02:40.423 --> 1:02:43.025
- It's a date, you're cool?
- Yeah, well, why wouldn't I?

1:02:43.092 --> 1:02:45.762
- No, I was just wondering.
- So what, Josh is gorgeous.

1:02:45.828 --> 1:02:47.730
So what, he's gonna have
a great time.

1:02:48.965 --> 1:02:51.968
I'm at a crossroads when it
comes to Angela and Stacy.

1:02:54.103 --> 1:02:56.205
Angela, she has that potential
to be, you know,

1:02:56.272 --> 1:02:58.174
like wifey material.

1:02:58.241 --> 1:03:01.077
Angela on a date,
how do you feel about that?

1:03:01.144 --> 1:03:03.946
Um... I don't know.

1:03:04.013 --> 1:03:06.282
A little bit of mixed feelings.

1:03:06.349 --> 1:03:08.117
You feeling a little
bit jealous?

1:03:08.184 --> 1:03:09.285
Very uncomfortable.

1:03:09.352 --> 1:03:13.322
I feel like she's coming on
a little strong right now.

1:03:13.389 --> 1:03:15.191
It is what it is.
It is what it is.

1:03:15.258 --> 1:03:17.360
I'm confident in the
connection that we have.

1:03:17.426 --> 1:03:18.561
Yeah.

1:03:18.628 --> 1:03:22.765
Brendan M., he's feeling some
kind of way, about Angela.

1:03:22.832 --> 1:03:24.667
I feel like there's a touch
of a riff there.

1:03:24.734 --> 1:03:27.270
I feel like my boy's a
little confused right now.

1:03:27.336 --> 1:03:30.039
I'm just, you know, I'm trying
to be as calm as possible and,

1:03:30.106 --> 1:03:32.642
and the bond that I have
with Angela, right now,

1:03:32.708 --> 1:03:35.711
that probably is the strongest
bond that I have so far.

1:03:35.778 --> 1:03:38.214
He needs to
figure it out ́cause

1:03:38.281 --> 1:03:40.016
he's gonna push
the girl away.

1:03:44.987 --> 1:03:46.989
I'm really conflicted, you know?

1:03:47.056 --> 1:03:49.659
I'm in a tough spot
right now, so...

1:03:49.725 --> 1:03:50.860
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1:03:50.927 --> 1:03:52.829
I do not envy you, my good man.

1:04:00.469 --> 1:04:05.808
Coming up next time, on Bachelor
<i>in Paradise Canada...</i>

1:04:05.875 --> 1:04:09.912
Oh, my God!
What the [beep]!

1:04:09.979 --> 1:04:12.949
Unless another girl shows up,
3 guys are going home.

1:04:13.015 --> 1:04:14.717
My best chance at a
rose this week is

1:04:14.784 --> 1:04:16.152
a friendship rose from Lisa.

1:04:18.254 --> 1:04:19.822
There's only so
many men that can

1:04:19.889 --> 1:04:21.724
play on the court
at one time.

1:04:21.791 --> 1:04:25.328
Just stay in your own lane.
Don't try to mess things up.

1:04:25.394 --> 1:04:27.029
I'm marking my territory.

1:04:27.096 --> 1:04:28.164
It's like my dog
every morning.

1:04:28.231 --> 1:04:30.066
He goes out,
pees in the same spot,

1:04:30.132 --> 1:04:32.168
so when another little puppy
comes by, he knows,

1:04:32.235 --> 1:04:33.803
that's my spot.

1:04:34.971 --> 1:04:36.439
Don't come in my lane.

1:04:36.505 --> 1:04:37.440
What is going on with you?

1:04:37.506 --> 1:04:40.276
You can't prepare for
anything in Paradise.

1:04:40.343 --> 1:04:43.412
Kamil, he's pushed me
to the wayside.

1:04:43.479 --> 1:04:46.249
Like, what's left for me?

1:04:46.315 --> 1:04:47.717
<i>And then...</i>

1:04:47.783 --> 1:04:50.286
- How was the date?
- It was a workout.

1:04:50.353 --> 1:04:53.022
This situation right here is
the hardest part of Paradise.

1:04:53.089 --> 1:04:55.825
- He did give me a smooch.
- Oh my gosh.

1:04:55.891 --> 1:04:56.826
No!

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:57.927
I don't know
what's going on.

1:04:57.994 --> 1:04:59.996
Crazy!

1:05:00.062 --> 1:05:02.798
Dude, apparently,
they made out the whole time.

1:05:02.865 --> 1:05:04.066
Where's Brendan?

1:05:04.133 --> 1:05:07.503
I'm really confused right now
and I'm not gonna lie to you.

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:10.072
I'll leave tomorrow.

1:05:10.139 --> 1:05:12.775
This is Paradise.
This is what it's all about.

1:05:12.842 --> 1:05:14.210
This is the shit I was
talking about, man!

1:05:14.277 --> 1:05:16.245
This is the shit I
wanted to see!

1:05:16.312 --> 1:05:20.116
<i>♪</i>

1:05:20.182 --> 1:05:21.951
Oh, yeah, oh, okay.

1:05:22.018 --> 1:05:25.488
Mhm. You're doing great.

1:05:26.656 --> 1:05:27.556
You're gonna watch the guys
work out too with us?

1:05:27.623 --> 1:05:30.293
Yeah, I'm gonna fan
myself off. This is hot.

1:05:30.359 --> 1:05:31.260
- Dave!
- What?

1:05:31.327 --> 1:05:33.796
- Come, come lay on the floor.
- Holy shit.

1:05:33.863 --> 1:05:35.765
- Stay tight.
- Okay.

1:05:35.831 --> 1:05:36.999
You know I have a huge ass?

1:05:37.066 --> 1:05:39.435
Just flex your abs,
flex your abs, core!

1:05:39.502 --> 1:05:41.337
Tight, tight.

1:05:41.404 --> 1:05:43.472
Okay, okay, baby. Let's go!

1:05:43.539 --> 1:05:46.208
I want 5 more! Let's go!

1:05:46.275 --> 1:05:50.046
If I'm your personal trainer,
this is what I want 24/7.

1:05:50.112 --> 1:05:51.213
Pumping iron.

1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:52.381
- I'm impressed.
- I'm impressed.

1:05:52.448 --> 1:05:54.150
Impressed by the display of
manliness in front of me.

1:05:54.216 --> 1:05:57.286
Alright, Jeremy, lay down.

1:05:57.353 --> 1:06:00.489
Oh, God!
Everything in me to do this.

1:06:00.556 --> 1:06:02.558
Holy shit, Jer, you're big.

1:06:02.625 --> 1:06:05.094
- Keep going, come on.
- That's all I need.
