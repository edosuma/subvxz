00:15.415 --> 00:18.032
<i>El Gato!</i>

00:31.696 --> 00:34.354
<b>2x11- "No"</b>

01:26.206 --> 01:28.709
Hold, young pig!

01:28.835 --> 01:30.544
All must remain indoors

01:30.628 --> 01:32.713
until the spell is completed.

01:32.797 --> 01:34.548
Thus I command.

01:34.715 --> 01:37.468
But I...
- Do not question the great mage Sino.

01:37.551 --> 01:39.679
This command is for your protection.

01:39.762 --> 01:42.723
We wouldn't have to stay inside
if you hadn't sent Puss away.

01:42.890 --> 01:44.600
He always protected us.

01:44.684 --> 01:48.145
What part of "do not question"
do you not understand?

01:48.228 --> 01:51.357
Can you use "question"
in a sentence, please?

01:51.440 --> 01:53.442
Go inside!

01:59.532 --> 02:00.908
Sino is scary.

02:01.408 --> 02:04.119
Toby, Uli's been telling us
one of his charming folk tales.

02:04.203 --> 02:08.041
Ja, it is the Tale of the Boy
Who Was Too Proud of His Shoes,

02:08.122 --> 02:10.584
und we are right at the amusing finish.

02:10.668 --> 02:13.629
So, the boy's mother chopped off his feet

02:13.713 --> 02:16.215
so he could never be too prideful again.

02:16.298 --> 02:18.175
The end.

02:18.300 --> 02:21.178
You see?
It is funny because without feet,

02:21.261 --> 02:23.347
what need has he for shoes?

02:23.430 --> 02:25.099
So humorous.

02:27.101 --> 02:28.811
Uli is scary.

02:28.895 --> 02:32.023
So, who would like to try
some delicious zuckerkiesel?

02:32.690 --> 02:34.400
Ah.

02:34.483 --> 02:36.527
They're like delicious rocks.

02:36.610 --> 02:39.947
Only not delicious
and I think they're really rocks.

02:40.031 --> 02:41.240
They are rocks.

02:41.323 --> 02:42.366
Mit sugar.

03:07.641 --> 03:10.895
Oh, Puss, where are you?

03:26.577 --> 03:28.203
<i>♪ Puss and the Black Cats ♪</i>

<i>What great joy the fruits
of our heroic labors bring us all.</i>

04:19.922 --> 04:23.509
And what great joy
to know that Puss in Boots

04:23.592 --> 04:26.679
is our great friend,
and never shall leave us,

04:26.762 --> 04:28.430
ever, ever, ever!

04:28.514 --> 04:32.392
Not even if we have
a sweaty palm problem

04:32.476 --> 04:34.269
that isn't our fault.

04:34.353 --> 04:36.897
Yes, yes, so much joy.

04:37.940 --> 04:41.194
Really, I am having
a lot of joy right now.

04:43.445 --> 04:45.322
I failed you, San Lorenzo.

04:45.405 --> 04:47.950
You are better off without me.

04:50.327 --> 04:53.288
<i>That is not the way
to distill Arcanum Corallinum.</i>

04:55.666 --> 05:00.295
Of course not. It's the way to distill
some delicious birch bark tea.

05:01.380 --> 05:03.257
Would you like a sip?
- No!

05:03.340 --> 05:05.425
You must complete the spell.

05:05.509 --> 05:08.595
Thus commands the great mage Sino.

05:08.679 --> 05:12.266
All righty, more tea for me
and Admiral Owloysius.

05:13.308 --> 05:16.562
<i>Oh!
Me like-y so much.</i>

05:16.645 --> 05:18.772
Now, what was I doing?
- The spell!

05:18.856 --> 05:20.733
Work on the spell!

05:20.816 --> 05:22.985
Okay, keep your robe on.

05:23.069 --> 05:25.320
That's a mighty nice robe, by the way.

05:25.404 --> 05:27.322
I used to have one just like it.

05:28.824 --> 05:32.494
<i>Focus, you old fool!
The eclipse is tomorrow.</i>

05:32.578 --> 05:34.997
<i>You must complete the spell by then.</i>

05:35.081 --> 05:36.207
Yes, the eclipse.

05:36.290 --> 05:39.376
Terrible doom coming.
Must get the spell ready.

05:39.459 --> 05:41.295
And what spell is that again?

05:41.378 --> 05:42.337
The spell!

05:42.421 --> 05:43.881
The spell.
- To protect.

05:44.006 --> 05:45.132
To protect.
- San.

05:45.216 --> 05:46.550
San...

05:46.633 --> 05:49.469
Lorenzo!
- Lorenzo. Understood.

05:50.512 --> 05:52.347
Now, who is this "Lorenzo" fellow?

05:52.431 --> 05:54.516
Just do the spell, you old buffoon!

05:54.600 --> 05:57.811
Hey, can you hold it down?
I'm trying to work on the spell!

05:58.645 --> 06:00.439
I'm getting a headache.

06:00.898 --> 06:02.399
Ah, coming along now.

06:02.482 --> 06:05.485
Ooh, it's a very complicated spell.

06:05.569 --> 06:07.821
But you must know that, right?

06:07.905 --> 06:09.282
Because it's your spell?

06:09.364 --> 06:10.449
Of course!

06:10.532 --> 06:14.245
And I would do it myself,
but no one can do this spell twice.

06:14.328 --> 06:17.998
Really? It doesn't say anything about that
in the scroll here.

06:18.999 --> 06:22.169
Do not question the great mage Sino.

06:22.628 --> 06:24.379
You will complete the spell

06:24.463 --> 06:27.382
and you will do it
before the eclipse tomorrow,

06:27.466 --> 06:31.262
or you will not live to see the eclipse.

06:41.647 --> 06:46.193
There's something not right about
that Sino guy, Admiral Owloysius.

06:46.277 --> 06:48.445
<i>He's a big meanie.</i>

06:48.528 --> 06:49.780
I know, right?

06:49.863 --> 06:53.533
And this spell,
it just feels wrong somehow.

06:53.617 --> 06:55.953
It feels... evil.

06:57.079 --> 06:58.664
The spell is evil?

07:00.833 --> 07:03.585
It doesn't seem
like a spell of protection.

07:03.669 --> 07:07.173
It seems more like a spell of,
I don't know, summoning.

07:07.256 --> 07:08.423
Oh, my.

07:08.507 --> 07:10.884
No one ever summons anything good.

07:12.719 --> 07:13.846
And that Sino.

07:13.929 --> 07:17.474
He doesn't seem very... Sino-y.

07:17.557 --> 07:20.477
I know. There's something off about him.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.521
I always imagined Sino would be kind and...

07:22.604 --> 07:24.064
<i>Artephius!</i>

07:24.439 --> 07:28.068
Why are you not working on
the spell as I commanded?

07:28.485 --> 07:31.197
Oh, yeah, look at the time!
I was just, uh...

07:31.280 --> 07:32.739
Well, back to work.

07:34.449 --> 07:36.493
Hmm. You!

07:36.576 --> 07:41.040
All are to remain inside
until the spell is complete.

07:41.123 --> 07:43.917
Yes, well, that makes sense,
oh, Great Mage.

07:44.001 --> 07:46.712
But tell me, once the spell is in place,

07:46.795 --> 07:50.007
will the secret phrase to enter town
be the same as before?

07:51.133 --> 07:52.051
Yes.

07:52.968 --> 07:54.345
And what was that again?

07:55.804 --> 07:57.431
It was, uh...

07:57.514 --> 08:01.935
"Magic treasure at the center,
lift the veil that I may enter."

08:02.019 --> 08:02.895
Now go!

08:06.732 --> 08:08.525
It was "mystic treasure."

08:08.608 --> 08:10.485
The real Sino would know that.

08:16.450 --> 08:18.077
We're in trouble, Babieca.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.372
And there's only one person who can help.
Can you find him?

08:24.499 --> 08:25.834
<i>Paella's ready.</i>

08:25.918 --> 08:29.463
Did you make it the way I like,
with saffron and extra shrimp?

08:29.546 --> 08:32.549
Or the way I like,
with shoelaces and carpet tacks?

08:32.631 --> 08:34.592
No. Those aren't food things.

08:34.676 --> 08:37.471
I made it the way Puss likes it,
because he's...

08:38.554 --> 08:39.390
...depressed.

08:39.932 --> 08:41.225
I am not depressed.

08:41.308 --> 08:44.102
I am merely very interested
in this ant colony.

08:44.186 --> 08:47.856
For instance,
I have noticed that they never...

08:47.940 --> 08:51.735
banish any of their members
into the cold, lonely darkness.

08:52.778 --> 08:55.030
Perhaps thou shouldst talk to him.

08:55.114 --> 08:56.573
Ah, why me?

08:56.656 --> 08:58.200
Because I'm pretentious...

08:58.284 --> 09:00.702
...and Phillip eats carpet tacks.

09:02.788 --> 09:04.831
They taste like bleeding.

09:09.086 --> 09:11.004
Hey there, sport.

09:11.088 --> 09:15.134
How ya doin', huh?
Feelin' a little down? Buddy?

09:15.884 --> 09:17.803
A little blue, huh?

09:17.886 --> 09:20.680
I will be honest
with you, Baltasar.

09:20.764 --> 09:24.893
My regret over having failed
the people of San Lorenzo is unbearable.

09:24.977 --> 09:26.520
I cannot stop thinking of them.

09:26.603 --> 09:27.521
<i>Puss!</i>

09:27.604 --> 09:30.065
Sometimes I can almost hear their voices.

09:30.149 --> 09:30.983
<i>Puss!</i>

09:31.066 --> 09:32.692
Calling out to me from a distance,

09:32.776 --> 09:34.027
almost as if...
- Puss!

09:34.903 --> 09:37.239
Dulcinea!

09:37.323 --> 09:39.908
It is, uh, good to see you.
- Puss, I have to tell you...

09:39.992 --> 09:42.995
As you can see, I am having
a marvelous time here in the woods

09:43.078 --> 09:44.621
with my wonderful new friends,

09:44.704 --> 09:46.832
the Guild of Darkness.

09:46.915 --> 09:49.751
Darkness, darkness, darkness...

09:51.170 --> 09:52.254
Puss. Sino is...

09:52.338 --> 09:54.256
Yes, I am glad that Sino banished me.

09:54.340 --> 09:55.508
I love this nomadic life

09:55.590 --> 09:58.218
and spend no time
weeping silently to myself.

09:58.302 --> 10:00.095
Nothing could possibly coax me back

10:00.179 --> 10:02.097
to the humdrum tedium of San Lorenzo.

10:02.181 --> 10:05.351
Sino is a fake and the spell is evil
and you have to come back!

10:07.602 --> 10:09.271
I thought you would never ask.

10:10.314 --> 10:11.398
We go at once.

10:11.482 --> 10:12.899
<i>Whoo!</i>

10:12.983 --> 10:13.817
Babieca!

10:13.900 --> 10:15.819
Wait! Don't you want to say goodbye
to your friends?

10:15.902 --> 10:17.696
My what? Oh, right.

10:18.071 --> 10:20.115
Guild of Darkness, I must leave you.

10:20.199 --> 10:21.575
Please don't go!

10:21.658 --> 10:24.077
It's so boring without you.

10:24.161 --> 10:28.374
I don't want you to leave me,
but honestly, I would leave me if I could.

10:28.457 --> 10:31.460
I cannot stay,
but perhaps you'd like to come with me

10:31.544 --> 10:34.754
and fight what will doubtless be
a mighty, perilous evil!

10:36.507 --> 10:37.508
Have a nice trip.

10:37.591 --> 10:39.301
See you around, buddy.
- My gums are bleeding.

10:39.634 --> 10:41.011
Then farewell, my friends.

10:41.094 --> 10:43.389
I hope that we will meet again one day.

10:43.472 --> 10:46.433
Now, Babieca, to San Lorenzo!

10:46.517 --> 10:47.518
And glory!

10:55.984 --> 10:59.238
At last, I will right my greatest wrong.

10:59.321 --> 11:01.781
I will be the savior of San Lorenzo.

11:01.865 --> 11:03.450
They will have a parade in my honor.

11:03.534 --> 11:06.412
And they will build me a statue
of solid obsidian.

11:06.495 --> 11:08.581
Or marble. Maybe marble.

11:09.248 --> 11:10.541
I said that all out loud, didn't I?

11:10.624 --> 11:13.502
Puss, how are you gonna fight Sino?
He may be a fake...

11:13.627 --> 11:15.003
Ah-det-det-det.

11:18.882 --> 11:21.218
Ha!

11:29.560 --> 11:32.687
<i>The Lorenzo Lapis Lazuli!</i>

11:33.730 --> 11:37.109
Four grains saccharum saturni,

11:37.192 --> 11:41.572
five pinches, six geese a-laying...

11:44.658 --> 11:45.784
Wake up!

11:45.867 --> 11:47.786
I don't think I have enough geese.

11:47.869 --> 11:49.996
There are no geese, you fool.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.831
Only one ingredient remains.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.460
The argentum aetherium.

11:56.253 --> 11:57.588
I don't know.

11:57.671 --> 11:59.714
I just don't feel right about this.

11:59.798 --> 12:01.758
Do not incur my wrath!

12:01.841 --> 12:03.260
Okay, okay.

12:03.343 --> 12:04.511
Here goes nothing.

12:10.142 --> 12:11.143
<i>Sino!</i>

12:11.226 --> 12:12.352
It's Puss!

12:13.395 --> 12:14.938
No, come back!

12:15.522 --> 12:16.815
Puss!

12:27.284 --> 12:28.285
<i>Puss!</i>

12:30.078 --> 12:31.955
Am I glad to see you.

12:32.038 --> 12:34.124
What are you doing here?

12:34.625 --> 12:37.419
I am here to tell Artephius
to stop working on that spell.

12:37.503 --> 12:39.754
Oh, thank goodness! It's fishy.

12:39.838 --> 12:41.131
Yes, it is.

12:41.214 --> 12:43.175
And it is not all that is fishy.

12:43.258 --> 12:45.385
You, sir, are not Sino!

12:45.552 --> 12:46.386
What?

12:48.180 --> 12:50.641
How dare you. You are banished!

12:50.724 --> 12:53.477
No, it is you
who are about to be banished.

12:55.562 --> 12:57.189
Ha!

12:57.272 --> 12:59.733
You are not the only one
who can use magic.

13:21.087 --> 13:24.675
Your magic stone is no match for my staff.

13:24.758 --> 13:27.720
I am a mighty sorcerer!

13:30.764 --> 13:34.518
And I am Puss in Boots!

13:45.070 --> 13:46.905
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

13:46.988 --> 13:48.615
It's not him!

13:48.699 --> 13:50.492
<i>That's not Sino.
- No.</i>

13:51.201 --> 13:53.078
I'm not Sino.

13:53.161 --> 13:57.416
I am...
Fartholomew Fishflinger!

13:57.499 --> 13:59.209
The mouse?

13:59.292 --> 14:01.086
A mouse no longer.

14:01.169 --> 14:04.047
Not since that cat ate me.

14:04.130 --> 14:06.508
Dulcinea? You ate the mouse?

14:06.592 --> 14:09.052
Well, he was bad. Someone had to eat him.

14:09.553 --> 14:12.013
I am... kind of impressed.

14:12.972 --> 14:15.100
I was almost out of this rotten town...

14:16.101 --> 14:17.436
...when that cat caught me.

14:20.647 --> 14:24.401
But a sorcerer of my caliber
cannot be destroyed.

14:24.526 --> 14:27.028
Eating me only released my soul.

14:29.489 --> 14:31.825
I wandered the Earth, looking for power.

14:31.908 --> 14:35.412
I sought out sources of magic
all around the world...

14:36.705 --> 14:39.374
...absorbing their energy
and making it my own,

14:39.458 --> 14:42.711
until I had enough mystic power
to create the illusion

14:42.795 --> 14:46.089
of this form you see before you.

14:46.465 --> 14:49.551
Then I came here and fooled you all!

14:50.427 --> 14:54.473
All of us
except the smartest cat in San Lorenzo,

14:54.556 --> 14:55.474
Dulcinea.

14:57.851 --> 15:00.186
And now, you have met your match.

15:00.687 --> 15:02.689
Don't be so sure, Puss in Boots.

15:02.773 --> 15:07.444
I have a secret weapon:
the Anulus Sceletus.

15:08.945 --> 15:11.072
Not the Anulus Sceletus.

15:11.156 --> 15:14.451
Anything but the Anulus Sceletus!

15:14.534 --> 15:17.370
You do not know what that is.
- No, I do not!

15:41.311 --> 15:42.437
Oh, boy.

15:42.771 --> 15:44.314
Yes!

15:47.776 --> 15:51.488
I am master of the skeleton army!

15:53.114 --> 15:55.033
Of course you are.

15:55.450 --> 15:57.452
Attack, my minions!

15:59.496 --> 16:00.580
En garde.

16:20.642 --> 16:22.394
<i>Yay!</i>

16:50.881 --> 16:52.925
Is it time?
- For the eclipse?

16:53.007 --> 16:54.509
Almost.

16:54.968 --> 16:57.470
But I don't think that really matters now.

17:35.383 --> 17:37.677
There must be something you can do.

17:50.732 --> 17:54.193
We couldst not leave thee
to perish, friend.

17:54.277 --> 17:57.322
Yeah, and it was boring out there
in the forest without you.

17:57.656 --> 17:59.073
Well done. Now come.

17:59.157 --> 18:01.701
We have a bone to pick
with these skeletons.

18:18.259 --> 18:19.385
Hiyah!

18:26.893 --> 18:28.854
Ha! You cannot keep this up, villain.

18:28.937 --> 18:31.523
As long as I have this ring,
I have a chance.

18:31.982 --> 18:33.149
That is good to know.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.585
Oh, bugnuggets.

19:05.849 --> 19:07.767
<i>Fools!</i>

19:07.851 --> 19:09.602
<i>You think you've won.</i>

19:10.186 --> 19:13.147
<i>But you've only beaten one of us.</i>

19:14.524 --> 19:16.150
<i>What did I mean by that?</i>

19:19.029 --> 19:20.697
Thank you, my friends.

19:20.780 --> 19:26.536
<i>Black Cats forever!</i>

19:26.619 --> 19:29.205
Now, my fellow ebon felines,

19:29.288 --> 19:32.542
let us see if we canst find
that skeleton ring.

19:32.625 --> 19:34.961
For verily, it was super neat.

19:35.045 --> 19:36.922
We like shiny things.

19:37.005 --> 19:40.133
Bye, bye, bye, bye...

19:50.518 --> 19:53.271
Well, Artephius,
the treasure is all in place

19:53.354 --> 19:55.398
and just in time for the eclipse.

19:56.232 --> 19:57.943
Sadly, it would seem that the spell

19:58.026 --> 19:59.945
you have been preparing
is not the right one.

20:00.486 --> 20:03.031
Yeah, but I'm dying to know
what it would have done.

20:03.115 --> 20:05.658
Something real terrible, I bet.
- Excuse me.

20:05.742 --> 20:09.370
Am I the only one who's worried about that
"you have only beaten one of us" thing?

20:09.454 --> 20:11.581
Eh, I'm sure it was nothing.

20:37.857 --> 20:40.443
The deed is done. I have fooled you all.

20:40.526 --> 20:42.695
I have fooled you. Und you.

20:42.779 --> 20:45.698
Und you. Und now, he comes!

20:45.782 --> 20:48.076
He comes!
- Who comes?

20:48.451 --> 20:50.036
Das Blutwolf.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.164
Das Blutwolf!

20:52.246 --> 20:53.915
What is a Blutwolf?

20:54.332 --> 20:55.667
The Bloodwolf.

21:05.802 --> 21:08.513
<i>The most fearsome being
ever to walk on the Earth.</i>

21:09.014 --> 21:11.265
<i>He was the arch nemesis of Sino.</i>

21:11.349 --> 21:12.934
<i>Hundreds of years ago,</i>

21:13.018 --> 21:16.104
<i>the Great Mage banished him
to the netherworld.</i>

21:16.604 --> 21:19.941
It was I who convinced
Fartholomew to pose as Sino.

21:20.483 --> 21:23.820
It was I who planted that false
scroll for Artephius to find.

21:24.196 --> 21:27.490
Und it was I who at last
succeeded in summoning

21:27.573 --> 21:30.451
Das Blutwolf from the netherworld!

21:36.833 --> 21:42.214
Soon he will return
to plunge all the world into suffering!

21:42.296 --> 21:45.466
Whoo-hoo!
It will be so neato.

21:51.681 --> 21:54.684
A dog. Why did it have to be a dog?

21:58.021 --> 22:01.524
The Blutwolf, he will destroy you all.

22:03.943 --> 22:06.196
Yay! Woo-hoo!

22:07.197 --> 22:08.406
Toby, why are you happy?

22:08.531 --> 22:12.285
If Uli's evil, that means
I'm definitely your best friend.

22:12.368 --> 22:13.995
I win!
- No!

22:14.453 --> 22:16.956
You lose. You all lose.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.375
The whole world loses!

22:21.169 --> 22:23.379
Das Blutwolf!

22:25.924 --> 22:28.426
I think that this
is going to be a problem.
