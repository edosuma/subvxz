WEBVTT

00:04.153 --> 00:05.903
I'm not letting you Neanderthals
in to rape my company.

00:05.986 --> 00:06.820
Daddy's boy.

00:07.195 --> 00:09.362
How can we salvage this?
Do we need to sweeten the offer?

00:13.278 --> 00:15.153
Everybody,
this is cousin Craig.

00:15.362 --> 00:17.487
-It's Greg.
-I'll-- I'll answer to both.

00:17.570 --> 00:18.654
I changed my mind.

00:18.737 --> 00:20.986
I'm staying on
as head of the company.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.153
You fucked me.

00:22.737 --> 00:23.861
LOGAN ROY:
On the family trust,

00:23.945 --> 00:26.737
I'm gonna add Marcy to myself
and you four.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.737
I'm gonna have to talk
to my lawyers.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.445
What're you thinking, son?
She's very smart.

00:31.529 --> 00:32.945
-Family first.
-ROMAN ROY: Um, sure.

00:33.028 --> 00:34.153
But I want to run the damn show.

00:34.237 --> 00:36.278
And until it opens up,
chief operating officer.

00:36.654 --> 00:38.570
We stick to the plan,
I takeover.

00:38.654 --> 00:40.278
-And you two, under me...

00:40.362 --> 00:41.195
Can we think about it?

00:41.779 --> 00:43.195
-KENDALL ROY: Yeah, of course.
-I thought about it. Fuck you!

00:43.861 --> 00:45.612
KENDALL: Sorry the other
offer fell through.

00:45.695 --> 00:46.570
But we fattened the goose nice--

00:46.820 --> 00:48.820
I'm gonna eat you all.
One by fucking one.

00:49.362 --> 00:50.403
LOGAN:
What do you say, kids?

00:50.654 --> 00:52.362
Our position is, this
doesn't quite work for us.

00:53.779 --> 00:55.695
Dad?!

00:56.945 --> 00:59.320
SHIV ROY:  Kendall.
Dad is in the hospital.

01:12.111 --> 01:14.237
Rava. Hey.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.654
Uh, my dad's--

01:15.737 --> 01:18.028
My dad's in the hospital.

01:18.111 --> 01:20.111
Yeah, he had, I don't know,

01:20.195 --> 01:22.195
I don't know what.

01:22.278 --> 01:25.028
But, uh...

01:25.111 --> 01:27.695
yeah, I don't know
if he's gonna be OK.

01:27.779 --> 01:30.278
It's-- Yeah.

01:30.362 --> 01:34.654
So... I don't know.
I'm here with Jess.

01:34.737 --> 01:35.986
We're just trying
to get there--

01:37.570 --> 01:39.153
Can we just find a way
around the traffic, man?

01:39.237 --> 01:41.820
Just-- Just--
Just figure it out. Please!

01:51.362 --> 01:53.403
Where's the ICU?

01:58.278 --> 02:01.986
Man:
...blood pressure...

02:10.445 --> 02:12.278
Man:
...tests...

02:16.195 --> 02:19.529
What's the situation?
Can somebody--

02:19.612 --> 02:20.445
Excuse me.

02:20.529 --> 02:22.362
They're working on him.

02:22.445 --> 02:23.861
What is this part
of the hospital?

02:23.945 --> 02:25.695
I mean, is this
the best section?

02:25.779 --> 02:27.278
Excuse me? Doctor,

02:27.362 --> 02:29.654
is this the best part
of the hospital?

02:29.737 --> 02:31.986
Sorry. You know, we just--
we need to know.

02:32.070 --> 02:34.945
The ICU is the ICU.
This is the best place
for him.

02:35.028 --> 02:36.612
Is this where you would
take your father?

02:36.695 --> 02:39.278
I'm sorry. Can the team
have some space

02:39.362 --> 02:40.903
Hey, here's an idea.
Why don't you worry
about the medicine,

02:40.986 --> 02:42.570
not the fucking feng shui?

02:42.654 --> 02:44.195
Connor:
Let's let the gentleman
do his job.

02:44.278 --> 02:45.362
Thank you.

02:45.445 --> 02:47.362
- Let's do this for Dad.
- Thank you.

02:47.445 --> 02:48.654
Shiv:
Sorry.

04:26.028 --> 04:28.403
Do they know
who we are?

04:28.487 --> 04:30.153
- I don't know.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.986
- I don't know.

04:33.570 --> 04:35.362
No. There's like
a million people to call.

04:35.445 --> 04:37.695
She's probably just make it
about herself, anyway.

04:37.779 --> 04:40.278
Come on.
Your mom's a maniac,
she's not a monster.

04:40.362 --> 04:42.278
Folks, we need you
to wait through there, please.

04:42.362 --> 04:43.612
Hi. I'm sorry.

04:43.695 --> 04:44.986
We're getting
mixed messages here.

04:45.070 --> 04:46.195
We have no clue
what's going on.

04:46.278 --> 04:47.403
We will be with you

04:47.487 --> 04:48.737
as soon as we have
an assessment.

04:48.820 --> 04:50.737
OK, well,
that's not good enough.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.861
We need to know
what's happening. Now.

04:52.945 --> 04:55.403
The socio-economic health
of multiple continents

04:55.487 --> 04:57.820
is dependent on his well-being.

04:57.903 --> 05:01.445
The socio-economic health
of multiple continents?

05:02.737 --> 05:04.237
Kendall. Everyone.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.487
We have an area
we can go to.

05:05.570 --> 05:07.028
They'll keep us posted.

05:11.945 --> 05:15.445
Kendall:
So, look, take me through
what happened exactly.

05:15.529 --> 05:17.695
Uh, I don't know,
exactly.

05:17.779 --> 05:20.320
It was weird. Um,
it happened fast,

05:20.403 --> 05:22.278
- we were just sitting there--
- Shiv: We were just talking.

05:22.362 --> 05:24.529
We were talking,
Shiv kind of started

05:24.612 --> 05:26.445
- hard-balling Dad a little bit.
- I wasn't hard-balling him.

05:26.529 --> 05:29.612
A brain hemorrhage
doesn't come from
some chit-chat, asshole.

05:29.695 --> 05:32.695
So it's definitely
a brain hemorrhage?
Is that what they said?

05:32.779 --> 05:34.403
Somebody said that,
right?

05:34.487 --> 05:36.111
I--

05:36.195 --> 05:38.529
- The ambulance--
- A stroke is a hemorrhage.

05:38.612 --> 05:39.529
- Yes.

05:39.612 --> 05:40.654
Did someone say "hemorrhage,"

05:40.737 --> 05:42.070
or is it just us
who said it?

05:42.153 --> 05:43.153
It could be an aneurism.

05:43.237 --> 05:44.820
Why aren't we chasing this?

05:44.903 --> 05:46.362
I'll chase.

05:46.445 --> 05:49.111
Connor:
Hey, uh, is there any--

05:49.195 --> 05:51.654
Did Dad ever talk to any
of you guys about cryogenics?

05:51.737 --> 05:55.903
You're insane.
Look, I don't want

05:55.986 --> 05:57.695
to be given the runaround

05:57.779 --> 06:00.737
by Doctor-fucking-SUNY Purchase
Medical School here.

06:00.820 --> 06:03.111
We need to know
who the top players are, OK?

06:03.195 --> 06:04.570
Who's the top dog
in this hospital?

06:04.654 --> 06:06.153
Have you talked
to Dad's neurologist?

06:06.237 --> 06:08.903
Kendall, stop acting like
the king of the hospital.

06:08.986 --> 06:12.320
We're all trying
to do our best,
so just fuck off.

06:12.403 --> 06:13.612
I'm on it. OK?

06:13.695 --> 06:16.070
According to this,
it sounds like a stroke,

06:16.153 --> 06:18.779
but it could be
an acute subdural hematoma.

06:18.861 --> 06:21.278
Great. Get in there
and operate, Doctor Google.

06:21.362 --> 06:23.028
Connor:
He once talked to me
about cryogenics.

06:23.111 --> 06:24.903
What?
Wouldn't that just be typical?

06:24.986 --> 06:26.195
All the other billionaires

06:26.278 --> 06:27.445
are strolling around
in new bodies,

06:27.529 --> 06:28.654
but not Dad,
because we were

06:28.737 --> 06:30.445
too embarrassed
to actually discuss it.

06:30.529 --> 06:31.695
Kendall:
He didn't talk to you
about cryogenics.

06:31.779 --> 06:33.487
You talked to him
about cryogenics

06:33.570 --> 06:35.570
because you're obsessed
with cryogenics.

06:35.654 --> 06:37.820
- I'm not really, Kendall.
- And what he didn't tell you,

06:37.903 --> 06:39.237
and what I'm telling you now,

06:39.320 --> 06:40.570
is that you are an idiot.

06:40.654 --> 06:42.403
Sticks and stones, Kenny.

06:42.487 --> 06:43.820
Yeah, I know.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.986
And on his birthday, too?
It's so shitty.

06:46.070 --> 06:47.445
Marianne:
So what's happening now?

06:47.529 --> 06:49.487
Are you staying at the hospital?

06:49.570 --> 06:50.737
I guess.

06:50.820 --> 06:52.278
I mean, I think I've got a job,

06:52.362 --> 06:53.445
but I don't know.

06:53.529 --> 06:54.903
Logan said I did,

06:54.986 --> 06:56.487
but Marcia was the only one
to hear it,

06:56.570 --> 06:59.570
so... and then he tragically,

06:59.654 --> 07:01.612
you know, like, whatever.

07:01.695 --> 07:03.820
Well, what sort of job?
Is it a good job?

07:03.903 --> 07:05.153
I don't know. Like,

07:05.237 --> 07:07.654
could be anything.

07:07.737 --> 07:09.779
And I have, like, 20 bucks left.

07:09.861 --> 07:11.487
The world is so fucked up.

07:11.570 --> 07:14.654
I am not  sending you
any more money, Greg.

07:14.737 --> 07:15.695
Step up.

07:15.779 --> 07:17.278
I'm not asking you to send me--

07:17.362 --> 07:18.320
Look,

07:18.403 --> 07:20.820
just make sure
about the job.

07:20.903 --> 07:22.820
- Yeah, I know.

07:22.903 --> 07:25.320
Hey, do you have cash?

07:25.403 --> 07:26.861
Oh.

07:26.945 --> 07:30.195
Yeah. Uh...

07:30.278 --> 07:31.861
no, just my last twenty.

07:31.945 --> 07:32.986
That's fine. Thanks.

07:33.070 --> 07:34.320
Um...

07:37.028 --> 07:40.278
I just got mugged by Shiv.

07:40.362 --> 07:44.153
Man on Video:
Born in humble circumstances
in Dundee, Scotland,

07:44.237 --> 07:46.861
shortly before the outbreak
of the Second World War,

07:46.945 --> 07:49.028
Logan Roy grew up in poverty,

07:49.111 --> 07:50.861
but died one of the richest

07:50.945 --> 07:52.403
and most powerful men
in America.

07:52.487 --> 07:55.237
His widowed mother
took the decision...

07:55.320 --> 07:56.861
Kendall:
It's an ATN obituary.

07:56.945 --> 08:00.111
They want us to OK it
in case they have to run it.

08:00.195 --> 08:02.153
Is it nice?

08:02.237 --> 08:06.445
I mean, it's made by
his own news division.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.529
Doesn't say he was a prick.

08:10.445 --> 08:11.779
You want to watch it?

08:11.861 --> 08:13.278
No.

08:14.487 --> 08:16.487
I would really love to see you.

08:16.570 --> 08:19.779
Yes, it's appropriate.
It could hardly be
more appropriate.

08:19.861 --> 08:20.820
OK?

08:20.903 --> 08:23.487
Yeah, OK. OK, good.

08:24.945 --> 08:27.237
There's nothing in here
about our mom.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.403
Or Connor's.
They need to be included.

08:29.487 --> 08:31.403
Yeah.

08:31.487 --> 08:35.570
PJ says Aziz Kahn
at Mayo Clinic
is the best there is.

08:35.654 --> 08:37.903
Sarah says Ann Wieman at NYU.

08:37.986 --> 08:40.570
Ann Wieman? Is that--
That's not who I have.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.320
Well, it's the name I have.

08:42.403 --> 08:44.153
Can you tell Sarah
to give her a call?

08:44.237 --> 08:45.945
- Sure.
- Hey, Rome.

08:46.028 --> 08:48.737
- Shiv: No, I've got--

08:48.861 --> 08:50.487
Now I'm strapped.
Was there any change at all?

08:50.570 --> 08:52.111
- Connor: Hey, you guys.

08:52.195 --> 08:53.903
Could I have the change?

08:53.986 --> 08:57.028
What is this? People are
sending shit already?

08:57.111 --> 08:59.028
It's from Lawrence Yee
at Vaulter.

09:00.570 --> 09:01.903
Call him and tell him

09:01.986 --> 09:03.445
that is not
fucking appreciated.

09:03.529 --> 09:05.445
Mm-hmm.

09:05.529 --> 09:08.153
- Kendall, I'm so sorry.
- Thank you, Gerri.

09:08.237 --> 09:09.320
Can you give me five?

09:09.403 --> 09:10.903
We need to talk.

09:10.986 --> 09:13.028
Over here, OK?

09:21.153 --> 09:23.487
Obviously the nominating
committee, the board,

09:23.570 --> 09:27.278
has a plan in the event
of Logan's incapacitation.

09:27.362 --> 09:29.153
Sorry, do I need
to hear this
right now?

09:29.237 --> 09:30.153
You do.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.028
In the event that we, uh,

09:32.111 --> 09:33.695
continue
on our trajectory

09:33.779 --> 09:36.153
of his current consciousness,

09:36.237 --> 09:38.320
we're gonna need
to announce a plan

09:38.403 --> 09:40.737
by around 6:30,
before the markets open,

09:40.820 --> 09:44.111
in order to avoid
a lot of funky chowder.

09:44.195 --> 09:45.737
Did you say funky chowder?

09:45.820 --> 09:47.028
We've set up
down here.

09:47.111 --> 09:48.737
Kendall:
What have you set up?

09:48.820 --> 09:50.654
Gerri:
You're gonna want
a place to just be,

09:50.737 --> 09:52.320
and chill,
you know?

09:52.403 --> 09:54.529
We talked to some
of the trustees
of the hospital,

09:54.612 --> 09:56.320
so everybody knows
who's who.

09:56.403 --> 09:59.487
Yeah. It's not a war room yet,
but, um...

09:59.570 --> 10:01.570
But if we need one,
it's available.

10:08.861 --> 10:10.820
Kendall:
Jesus.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.403
Uh, so there's a bathroom
through there--

10:13.487 --> 10:14.986
- Hi, Karolina--
- Hi.

10:15.070 --> 10:16.070
Thank you, guys.

10:16.153 --> 10:17.779
So I have Dewi and Asha

10:17.861 --> 10:20.111
from the nominating committee
on the line.

10:20.195 --> 10:22.612
Kendall's here,
and you're on speaker, guys.

10:22.695 --> 10:24.195
Dewi:
So sorry to hear
about the news.

10:24.278 --> 10:25.779
Asha:
Likewise.

10:25.861 --> 10:30.070
As you know, our standing plan
in the event of Logan's...

10:30.153 --> 10:34.237
absence, is to separate
his CEO and Chairman roles.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.111
Dewi:
You'll become acting CEO,

10:36.195 --> 10:38.820
Frank stays on as COO.

10:38.903 --> 10:41.445
We'll need to act fast.
Stabilize the stock price.

10:41.529 --> 10:42.529
Dewi

10:42.612 --> 10:45.362
I'm sorry...

10:45.445 --> 10:47.362
my dad is my focus
right now, OK?

10:47.445 --> 10:49.820
Of course, it's just that
there's a problem

10:49.903 --> 10:51.237
in terms of the optics

10:51.320 --> 10:54.487
if what happened earlier today
between you two gets out.

10:56.570 --> 10:59.237
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.278
Sure. Well...

11:01.362 --> 11:03.695
Dewi:
And then there's
the problem with Frank.

11:03.779 --> 11:06.403
- Eva: Logan fired him

11:06.487 --> 11:08.111
and promoted Roman.

11:08.195 --> 11:10.237
Roman?

11:10.320 --> 11:11.654
Jesus.

11:15.654 --> 11:17.654
Look, I'm sorry, I--

11:17.737 --> 11:20.570
I can't get into this
right now, guys.

11:20.654 --> 11:21.779
Karl:
No, of course.

11:21.861 --> 11:23.654
You are in no fit state.

11:32.861 --> 11:35.320
But here's my take, OK?

11:37.737 --> 11:40.362
My dad got sick today, right?

11:41.986 --> 11:44.070
I don't know, I mean,
nobody knows

11:44.153 --> 11:46.362
when he started
acting out of character,

11:46.445 --> 11:50.570
but, like, he didn't seem great
from the morning on,

11:50.654 --> 11:53.654
and there's no paper
on any of the moves made today.

11:53.737 --> 11:55.654
- Uh...

11:55.737 --> 11:56.737
nothing meaningful.

11:56.820 --> 11:57.695
Yeah, it was words.

11:57.779 --> 11:58.903
Words are just, what?

11:58.986 --> 11:59.820
Nothing.

11:59.903 --> 12:01.487
Complicated air flow.

12:01.570 --> 12:06.986
So, I mean, if I was saying
what actually happened today,

12:07.070 --> 12:08.861
it would be nothing.

12:10.028 --> 12:11.529
Gerri:
Well, that certainly

12:11.612 --> 12:13.570
makes things simpler
from our point of view.

12:13.654 --> 12:15.612
Do you think you can get
the family behind it?

12:15.695 --> 12:17.570
Yes.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.153
And Frank?

12:19.237 --> 12:21.278
Sure.

12:29.445 --> 12:31.737
Dude, can't we
just talk here?

12:31.820 --> 12:33.820
You know Connor's
invited Willa down?

12:33.903 --> 12:35.445
Ugh. What!

12:35.529 --> 12:37.070
What's the deal
with their deal?

12:37.153 --> 12:41.028
Unlike me, he has
no sense of boundaries.

12:41.111 --> 12:42.320
What the fuck?

12:42.403 --> 12:43.945
It's stale,
but it's empty, I think.

12:46.237 --> 12:49.153
No, I, um,
just wanted to--

12:49.237 --> 12:52.986
I've been thinking
that maybe this might be

12:53.070 --> 12:55.487
really tough on Marcia.

12:55.570 --> 12:57.070
Yeah,
you're thinkin' that?

12:57.153 --> 13:00.529
What, will she put
all her inheritance
into gold or oil?

13:00.612 --> 13:02.362
No, I just-- No, I--

13:02.445 --> 13:05.487
Look, I know that,
like, the trust only
comes into play

13:05.570 --> 13:07.195
if certain things happen...

13:07.278 --> 13:09.654
Ahem. Yeah, he's dead,
or brain dead.

13:09.737 --> 13:12.070
Yeah, but I was thinkin',
like...

13:12.153 --> 13:14.779
wouldn't it be nice
for Dad to wake up

13:14.861 --> 13:16.737
and for all of us
to have signed,

13:16.820 --> 13:18.153
like he wanted?

13:18.237 --> 13:19.737
You know,
like a nice gesture?

13:19.820 --> 13:20.986
And if he doesn't wake up,

13:21.070 --> 13:23.445
we've basically signed over
to Marcia

13:23.529 --> 13:26.654
the power to choose
the new Dad.

13:26.737 --> 13:30.570
So... OK.
So, for the record,

13:30.654 --> 13:34.487
you are declining to sign
on the change of trust?

13:34.570 --> 13:36.028
- Yeah.

13:36.111 --> 13:37.654
What the fuck is this,
McCarthyism?

13:37.737 --> 13:39.612
I'm not declining,
I'm just not--

13:39.695 --> 13:41.820
I'm not "clining."
What the f--

13:41.903 --> 13:43.861
OK. No. OK, just,
you know,

13:43.945 --> 13:47.320
that just seems
very shitty under
the circumstances.

13:47.403 --> 13:48.654
What circumstances?

13:48.737 --> 13:51.320
Well, you did make
her husband's brain explode.

13:51.403 --> 13:52.570
- Fuck you, man!
- Ow!

13:52.654 --> 13:54.237
- Ohh!
- Wait--

13:54.320 --> 13:56.070
- Stop it!
- You shit!

13:56.153 --> 13:58.111
What, are you fuckin' insane?

13:58.195 --> 14:01.695
( both shouting,
indistinct )

14:01.779 --> 14:04.153
- Roman: No! No!

14:08.153 --> 14:09.320
He--

14:09.403 --> 14:10.737
He doesn't deserve this.

14:10.820 --> 14:13.861
It's just so unfair.

14:13.945 --> 14:16.320
He's a great... man.

14:23.362 --> 14:26.945
He, like, let me
come to his birthday lunch.

14:27.028 --> 14:29.195
And he offered me a job.

14:31.237 --> 14:33.070
Right?

14:33.153 --> 14:34.612
He doesn't deserve this.

14:34.695 --> 14:38.779
And... so, if there's
anything that I can do,

14:38.861 --> 14:40.529
let me know.

14:43.320 --> 14:46.111
Actually,
there is something.

14:46.195 --> 14:47.945
- OK.
- Can you go to the apartment

14:48.028 --> 14:51.070
and get his bed things
and slippers?

14:51.153 --> 14:53.070
The ones with the dark checks.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.612
You don't mind?

14:54.695 --> 14:57.779
No, no. I'd be...

14:57.861 --> 15:01.320
respectfully, uh,
somberly willing.

15:01.403 --> 15:02.820
Marcia:
Thank you.

15:04.903 --> 15:06.529
- Please.

15:06.612 --> 15:08.362
OK. All right.

15:08.445 --> 15:13.153
Marcia, we get can get Colin
or the driver to go
and get his things.

15:13.237 --> 15:16.945
I don't need this fly
buzzing in my face.

15:17.028 --> 15:19.737
Slippers, slippers, slippers,
slippers, slippers.

15:19.820 --> 15:21.570
Yeah, don't fuck it up.

15:26.362 --> 15:30.111
Fuckin' long legs.
Greg! Hey, I need
a favor from you.

15:30.195 --> 15:31.487
What's up?

15:31.570 --> 15:33.737
Dad had some papers
he wanted us to sign,

15:33.820 --> 15:35.529
and they're in
some envelopes,

15:35.612 --> 15:37.695
just pick 'em up
at the house,
and bring 'em.

15:37.779 --> 15:40.153
- Yeah.

15:40.237 --> 15:43.445
They're in the house
somewhere. In envelopes--
They're just in the house!

15:43.529 --> 15:45.195
- OK. I was imagining--

15:45.278 --> 15:46.737
Oh, you're fucking tall.
This is hurting
my goddamn neck.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.529
I have to go. OK?
Just find the papers,

15:48.612 --> 15:50.028
and bring 'em back.

15:50.111 --> 15:51.403
Papers, and-- and--
they're gonna be just--

15:51.487 --> 15:52.861
I am so done with
this conversation.

15:52.945 --> 15:56.278
- All right. Yeah.

15:59.028 --> 16:00.320
Doctor:
Better not fuck this one up.

16:00.403 --> 16:02.153
I don't want Logan Roy's
newspapers

16:02.237 --> 16:04.278
goin' through my trash cans.

16:04.362 --> 16:07.070
( machinery whirring,
clanking )

16:22.111 --> 16:24.529
- Oh, my God! We've killed--
- Logan.

16:24.612 --> 16:26.028
- We're bastards!

16:26.111 --> 16:27.028
Shiv:
Turn that off.

16:28.403 --> 16:30.529
Roman, no.
Turn it off.

16:30.612 --> 16:32.403
- We've killed--
- Logan.

16:32.487 --> 16:33.737
- We're--

16:33.820 --> 16:35.237
What are they saying?

16:35.320 --> 16:37.570
Just rumors, you know.

16:37.654 --> 16:39.487
He was taken to the hospital,

16:39.570 --> 16:41.070
some of Twitter
says he's dead,

16:41.153 --> 16:43.237
and also a good deal of, um,

16:43.320 --> 16:47.737
of rejoicing at our father's
potential demise.

16:47.820 --> 16:50.153
Can we find out
who these fuckers are

16:50.237 --> 16:51.861
and, like... report them?

16:51.945 --> 16:54.820
Or just, like, screen grab
their shit.

16:54.903 --> 16:57.945
- OK.
Yeah?

16:58.028 --> 17:00.195
Connor:
So, I don't know
where Kendall is, but...

17:00.278 --> 17:03.445
Hi. Really sorry, you guys.

17:03.529 --> 17:04.861
Thanks, Willa.

17:04.945 --> 17:06.153
Why don't we sit over here.

17:06.237 --> 17:07.320
Oh, there's Ken.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.445
It's gross.

17:11.529 --> 17:13.654
Roman: Hey.

17:13.737 --> 17:15.445
News is out.

17:15.529 --> 17:17.195
OK, right. Well...

17:19.654 --> 17:21.861
So, um, listen.

17:24.779 --> 17:26.695
I don't even want
to think about this,

17:26.779 --> 17:29.237
but I just spoke
to the nominating committee,

17:29.320 --> 17:31.945
and, uh...

17:32.028 --> 17:34.445
the thing is
that the plan

17:34.529 --> 17:36.945
is to announce
that I take over
from Dad.

17:37.028 --> 17:39.153
- Well, no.

17:39.237 --> 17:40.487
- I mean,

17:40.570 --> 17:42.445
we're waiting for
the results of the scan.

17:42.529 --> 17:43.654
It's a pointless conversation.

17:43.737 --> 17:46.070
OK, well,
let's talk about it.

17:46.153 --> 17:47.945
I can't talk about it.
I'm upset.

17:48.028 --> 17:49.487
Hey! I'm upset too.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.278
Oh, not too upset
to go and fucking plot

17:51.362 --> 17:52.861
- with the suits.

17:52.945 --> 17:55.654
I could hardly hear them
for the blood rushing
in my ears.

17:55.737 --> 17:56.861
Isn't there a plan
anyways? Like--

17:56.945 --> 17:58.320
Yes, there's a plan.

17:58.403 --> 18:00.153
That's what I'm fucking
telling you.

18:00.237 --> 18:02.529
The plan is that Frank and I
will take over--

18:02.612 --> 18:05.445
- Frank was fired. So..
- Shiv: Yeah.

18:07.362 --> 18:10.362
OK. Well, I mean,
let's d-discuss

18:10.445 --> 18:12.028
and just see where we are,
right?

18:12.111 --> 18:13.861
I'm not doing this.

18:13.945 --> 18:18.070
If Dad dies, I don't want
to be talking about this shit
when he dies.

18:18.153 --> 18:19.570
He won't die.

18:24.570 --> 18:27.445
Greg:
Yeah, this is great.
Thank you.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.028
Greg:
Hey, man.

18:34.111 --> 18:36.070
Sorry, I'm--
I'm really sorry,

18:36.153 --> 18:37.695
but I don't have
any money for the cab.

18:37.779 --> 18:39.487
I'm sorry, sir,
do I know you?

18:39.570 --> 18:42.028
Yeah, I-I was here
a little earlier.

18:42.111 --> 18:43.403
I got assaulted a little
in there.

18:43.487 --> 18:45.861
So can you pay for the cab,
please?

18:45.945 --> 18:47.445
She was supposed to call,

18:47.529 --> 18:49.986
but maybe she didn't
because there's an emergency,

18:50.070 --> 18:51.237
uh, happening.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.861
Sir, I'm sorry,

18:52.945 --> 18:54.362
I don't know who you are.

18:54.445 --> 18:55.779
Um--

18:57.779 --> 18:58.903
sss--

18:58.986 --> 19:01.779
OK, so he's not
gonna lend me the money.

19:01.861 --> 19:04.695
So, I don't know, um...

19:04.779 --> 19:07.861
You know, he-- Pretty much,
he owes you your money.

19:07.945 --> 19:09.445
He owes me the

19:09.529 --> 19:11.779
You better give me
the money, dude.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.820
You guys need
to work this out
for yourselves,

19:16.903 --> 19:18.403
because basically
one of you guys

19:18.487 --> 19:21.570
hasn't got $14, OK?

19:25.945 --> 19:27.861
Doorman:
Yes, ma'am.

19:27.945 --> 19:29.278
Hello, Mrs. Roy?

20:01.070 --> 20:02.945
Knock knock.

20:03.028 --> 20:04.779
Oh.

20:04.861 --> 20:06.487
Thank you.

20:25.695 --> 20:27.195
I'm so sorry.

20:29.986 --> 20:31.695
It's so weird.

20:33.612 --> 20:35.445
I actually like hospitals.

20:35.529 --> 20:39.028
Lots of people don't.
But they're safe.

20:39.111 --> 20:42.153
The weird thing for me

20:42.237 --> 20:45.070
is that I was, well,

20:45.153 --> 20:48.320
I'd been intending
to talk to Logan,

20:48.403 --> 20:51.986
you know, and make a...
make a proposal,

20:52.070 --> 20:55.028
a very decent proposal,
to Shiv.

20:59.028 --> 21:01.986
Actually been meaning
to ask for his blessing
for a while,

21:02.070 --> 21:05.779
but, uh...
now it's very difficult.

21:07.111 --> 21:08.654
You need to find
the right time

21:08.737 --> 21:10.028
for these conversations.

21:10.111 --> 21:11.278
Right.

21:12.903 --> 21:15.070
The weird thing
I'm thinkin' now is,

21:15.153 --> 21:18.070
do you think Logan
would still like to be asked?

21:20.278 --> 21:22.070
You know? I mean,
I know he can't reply,

21:22.153 --> 21:24.820
but would he
appreciate the gesture

21:24.903 --> 21:27.153
if he was told
about it later?

21:27.237 --> 21:29.529
Or even in the case...

21:29.612 --> 21:33.362
in the case of the worst...
case,

21:33.445 --> 21:36.111
would it have been nice
to have asked his body?

21:38.654 --> 21:41.320
Woman on Video:
Rumors continue to circulate
about the health of...

21:41.403 --> 21:43.070
Hey, hey. They're ready.

21:43.153 --> 21:45.153
They have the results.

21:45.237 --> 21:46.820
OK. Fuck.

21:48.070 --> 21:49.153
You OK?

21:49.237 --> 21:50.779
Yeah. Yeah.
He'll be fine.

21:50.861 --> 21:52.820
He's probably
in there eating
a fucking chicken bucket

21:52.903 --> 21:54.737
and yelling at someone.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.362
He's had a hemorrhagic stroke,

21:56.445 --> 21:58.195
a bleed in
the deep right hemisphere

21:58.278 --> 21:59.820
that put pressure
on the thalamus
and the brain stem,

21:59.903 --> 22:01.695
and that's what caused
a loss of consciousness.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.195
So, what,
do you operate?

22:04.278 --> 22:07.903
We don't do that
with deep bleeds,
especially in older patients.

22:07.986 --> 22:10.320
- He's not an older patient.
- Dude, he just turned 80.

22:10.403 --> 22:13.779
But physically, he's, like,
still in his 70s,
and he's in great shape.

22:13.861 --> 22:15.403
The evidence
is that operating

22:15.487 --> 22:17.529
in situations like these
isn't worthwhile.

22:17.612 --> 22:20.737
So, then, what do you do?

22:20.820 --> 22:22.278
You can't do nothing.

22:22.362 --> 22:24.237
We will carry out
regular observations,

22:24.320 --> 22:26.570
and hopefully we'll see
some improvement soon.

22:26.654 --> 22:30.070
That's not good enough.
Right, Dr. Judith? That's--

22:30.153 --> 22:31.403
It's an excellent department.

22:31.487 --> 22:34.111
Well, thank you
for your input,

22:34.195 --> 22:36.028
but you'll understand
if we check out our options.

22:36.111 --> 22:38.820
My assistant's been in touch
with Ann Wieman at NYU,

22:38.903 --> 22:40.654
and we might move Dad there.

22:40.737 --> 22:43.445
No. He stays here.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.612
He gets better here.

22:45.695 --> 22:48.278
Well, we can discuss.

22:48.362 --> 22:49.945
We'll discuss
and get back to you.

22:50.028 --> 22:52.153
No. No discussion.

22:52.237 --> 22:55.945
I am his next of kin.
I am his proxy.

22:56.028 --> 22:58.403
I am in charge.
Thank you.

23:03.945 --> 23:05.612
Good. Well...

23:05.695 --> 23:07.612
we'll move Logan
to a suite in Greenberg.

23:07.695 --> 23:09.779
I'll show you the way.

23:09.861 --> 23:12.278
I'm sure you have
some questions.

23:12.362 --> 23:14.320
Feel free to ask me
on the way up.

23:21.820 --> 23:24.070
- I'm sorry, Ken.
- Thanks for coming over.

23:25.903 --> 23:27.487
OK, so look.

23:27.570 --> 23:29.445
We don't know
what's going on.

23:29.529 --> 23:31.986
He could be fine;
he could not.

23:32.070 --> 23:34.487
Either way, he's not
gonna be back tomorrow,

23:34.570 --> 23:36.153
so, long story short,

23:36.237 --> 23:39.320
will you carry on as COO,
step up on the board--

23:39.403 --> 23:41.070
- Become acting chairman.
- Yes.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.529
- No.

23:42.612 --> 23:45.320
He fired  me, Ken.

23:45.403 --> 23:47.070
He-- I--

23:47.153 --> 23:50.820
Look, I don't know
if he even knew
what he was saying...

23:50.903 --> 23:52.320
if his brain
was working.

23:52.403 --> 23:54.320
His brain
was working fine.

23:54.403 --> 23:56.529
Well, whatever else,
there's no proof, legally,

23:56.612 --> 23:58.820
- that yesterday even happened.
- That's not the problem.

23:58.903 --> 24:01.237
- I don't want to be chairman.

24:01.320 --> 24:05.195
I am just an attendant lord,
here to swell a scene or two.

24:05.278 --> 24:07.237
What the fuck
does that mean?

24:07.320 --> 24:08.529
Come on, don't do that.

24:08.612 --> 24:11.153
We could do
great things together.

24:11.237 --> 24:12.070
Mm-hmm.

24:12.153 --> 24:13.612
So what do you need,
Frank?

24:13.695 --> 24:17.570
A jazillion dollars
in unmarked Bitcoin.

24:17.654 --> 24:19.362
I don't have a price,
Ken.

24:19.445 --> 24:21.362
- Frank, I don't understand.
- Ju-- We'll talk.

24:21.445 --> 24:24.278
There's a lot of mess
to be cleaned up, Kendall,

24:24.362 --> 24:25.903
but you can do it, son.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.861
You can.

24:27.945 --> 24:30.111
And there's nothing I can say
to change your mind?

24:30.195 --> 24:33.111
I'm sorry
about your father.

24:33.195 --> 24:36.195
And good luck, Kenny.

24:36.278 --> 24:37.278
Yeah?

25:04.945 --> 25:07.487
I told Greg to bring
the change of trust.

25:07.570 --> 25:08.820
- And when he does,

25:08.903 --> 25:10.320
I think we should sign it.

25:10.403 --> 25:13.737
I-- I'm not doing anything
without my lawyer present.

25:13.820 --> 25:16.903
OK. Well, I'm going to sign it,
I'm getting Connor to sign it.

25:16.986 --> 25:19.986
It's gonna make you look
pretty fucking heartless
when you don't.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.986
Don't give me
a fuckin' scary look.

25:24.070 --> 25:26.529
You hit me,
I will fuck you up.

25:27.779 --> 25:28.945
Ahh, fuck.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.028
Yeah.

25:31.320 --> 25:33.153
God,
you're so annoying.

25:33.237 --> 25:34.529
Shut up.

26:01.278 --> 26:02.695
- Shiv: Greg.

26:02.779 --> 26:05.654
Hey. Did you find those
contracts Roman asked for?

26:05.737 --> 26:09.237
Uh, I... Yes, I got 'em.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.612
Oh, I think you have
the wrong ones.

26:11.695 --> 26:12.737
Uh, OK.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.695
Um... right.

26:14.779 --> 26:17.487
What, uh, what shall I do?

26:17.570 --> 26:20.320
Look,
there's a lot of confusion.

26:20.403 --> 26:23.237
'Cause if you have any doubt,
maybe you can't find them,

26:23.320 --> 26:24.529
and that might be simplest.

26:24.612 --> 26:25.737
But if I do,

26:25.820 --> 26:26.945
'cause I--

26:27.028 --> 26:28.820
I think I have
the right ones here.

26:28.903 --> 26:30.695
Don't bring them in.

26:30.779 --> 26:32.153
Did he change his mind?

26:32.237 --> 26:35.153
No. I'm just telling you:

26:35.237 --> 26:36.737
Don't bring them in.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.612
OK. OK. S--

26:38.695 --> 26:40.820
All right, I get-- I get it.

26:40.903 --> 26:43.237
So, who's the--

26:43.320 --> 26:45.362
Like, what's
the chain of command here?

26:45.445 --> 26:47.111
Are you the more senior sibling?

26:47.195 --> 26:48.153
Greg,

26:48.237 --> 26:49.612
it's simple.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.070
This is a favor
I'd like you to do for me,

26:52.153 --> 26:53.986
and I'd like you to be discreet.

26:54.070 --> 26:56.612
You stay for a while,
you can't find them,

26:56.695 --> 26:58.529
you come back. OK?

26:58.612 --> 27:00.945
- OK.
- Thank you.

27:24.195 --> 27:25.111
This is better.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.570
Um...

27:39.654 --> 27:42.737
look, so, I know
you don't want
to talk about this,

27:42.820 --> 27:46.111
I'm just informing you,
Roman as a board member

27:46.195 --> 27:47.695
and Shiv as a shareholder,

27:47.779 --> 27:50.986
I'll be taking temporary charge
as CEO and Chairman.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.362
Frank is not interested
in the position at present.

27:53.445 --> 27:55.612
No. I'm sorry, but even
if we were talking about this,

27:55.695 --> 27:59.237
which we are not,
it wouldn't necessarily be you.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.612
Kendall:
I'm sorry,
then who the fuck would it be?

28:01.695 --> 28:03.278
Roman:
I don't know. Anyone.

28:03.362 --> 28:04.903
It could be me.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.945
Are you insane?

28:08.028 --> 28:10.529
- Dad made me COO.
- I don't think so, dude.

28:10.612 --> 28:12.695
Dad wasn't
thinking straight.

28:12.779 --> 28:14.612
I think he was.

28:14.695 --> 28:17.445
You? The chief
operating officer?

28:17.529 --> 28:19.612
- Yup.
- I mean, if that wasn't a sign

28:19.695 --> 28:22.445
he was loco in the coco,
I don't know what is.

28:22.529 --> 28:24.403
Well,
I don't see it that way.

28:24.487 --> 28:27.445
Come on. It was
a negotiating position, Rome.

28:27.529 --> 28:29.028
He was fuckin' playing you

28:29.111 --> 28:31.612
to get you to sign
the change of trust.

28:31.695 --> 28:33.695
Do you even know
what it fucking involves?

28:33.779 --> 28:35.779
I mean,
he conked out mid-game.

28:35.861 --> 28:37.487
Are you calling me a dipshit?

28:37.570 --> 28:39.903
No. I love you, man,
but you're not
a serious person.

28:39.986 --> 28:43.028
All right, fuck you.
He's alive, you're not
the fuckin' boss.

28:43.111 --> 28:45.945
All right! Come on.
Let's not throw shit
around.

28:46.028 --> 28:49.111
We're in the middle,
so let's just sit tight.
No sudden moves.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.320
We need to move.
The markets are gonna

28:51.403 --> 28:52.820
want to know
who's behind the wheel.

28:52.903 --> 28:54.487
We need to control
the narrative.

28:54.570 --> 28:56.903
"Control the narrative."
You probably yell that
when you cum.

28:56.986 --> 28:59.320
"Oh! Control the narrative!
Oh! Control it--

28:59.403 --> 29:01.487
Control the narrative! Uhh..."

29:01.570 --> 29:03.320
Kendall:
Fuck you. We're in a hospital.

29:03.403 --> 29:04.362
Everyone knows.

29:04.445 --> 29:06.403
We have to say something.

29:06.487 --> 29:08.570
No. Actually, we don't.
'Cause no one knows
how serious it is.

29:08.654 --> 29:10.153
So we don't have
to say anything.

29:10.237 --> 29:11.612
Actually, we do. The SEC.

29:11.695 --> 29:13.487
There are rules,
there are laws...

29:13.570 --> 29:17.487
Oh, no. The law?
Well, we can't break the law.

29:17.570 --> 29:19.028
Hey, Karolina?

29:19.111 --> 29:21.861
Has a CEO ever
been out of action

29:21.945 --> 29:24.070
and people
haven't been told?

29:24.153 --> 29:28.153
Um, not that
I can think of.
There was Apple, but that--

29:28.237 --> 29:32.487
Right, but if we...
wanted to drag our feet on this,

29:32.570 --> 29:34.195
until we figure the moves...

29:34.278 --> 29:36.153
Well, once we do know,

29:36.237 --> 29:38.820
there's a duty to shareholders
to let people--

29:38.903 --> 29:41.195
Yeah, but I don't--
I don't know what we know.

29:41.278 --> 29:43.320
I mean, this could be
an allergic reaction.

29:43.403 --> 29:44.903
- It could be the flu.
- Oh, come on.

29:44.986 --> 29:47.028
Look at the fuckin' orchids.
This is out there.

29:47.111 --> 29:50.612
It's like we're
being held hostage
in the Honolulu airport.

29:52.403 --> 29:56.237
But if we wanted to say
something, you know,
other than...

29:56.320 --> 29:57.986
Kendall:
It's called a lie, Shiv.

29:58.070 --> 30:01.570
When you say the thing
that's not, that's a lie.

30:03.570 --> 30:05.737
We'll need to make
a holding statement.

30:05.820 --> 30:08.403
Of course, I'm open
to your suggestions

30:08.487 --> 30:10.362
on how to... finesse it.

30:10.445 --> 30:13.986
Perfect. We'll make a decision
and get back to you shortly.

30:14.070 --> 30:15.320
OK.

30:32.820 --> 30:35.028
TV Newscaster:
Logan Roy, CEO and chairman

30:35.111 --> 30:37.237
- of Waystar corporation...

30:37.320 --> 30:39.695
Well, I don't know.
What did she say?

30:39.779 --> 30:41.986
Roman said bring in the papers,

30:42.070 --> 30:44.153
Shiv said
don't bring in the papers.

30:44.237 --> 30:45.737
Well, I guess
you need to decide

30:45.820 --> 30:47.070
which one of them
is more important?

30:47.153 --> 30:50.237
I guess Roman's...
in the company,

30:50.320 --> 30:53.445
but Shiv seems like,
I don't know, more bossy?

30:53.529 --> 30:57.111
All right.
Well, can you just take
some  of the papers?

30:57.195 --> 30:59.529
Plus, I don't know
about these slippers.

30:59.612 --> 31:02.403
Like, they're all plaid.

31:02.487 --> 31:04.153
Does "checked" mean plaid?

31:04.237 --> 31:06.861
'Cause then there's gingham,
there's tartan--

31:06.945 --> 31:10.111
It's like a crisscross
fuckin' minefield.

31:10.195 --> 31:11.654
Oh, fuck the slippers, Greg.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.195
You have to strategize.

31:13.278 --> 31:15.612
I'm trying to strategize, Mom,
with you!

31:15.695 --> 31:17.320
But you won't strategize.

31:33.111 --> 31:34.737
Hey. What's up, Kendall?

31:34.820 --> 31:36.570
You mix me up
with your sponsor?

31:36.654 --> 31:39.487
Listen, I'm just calling
to issue a reminder.

31:39.570 --> 31:43.070
Your pecker's in my pocket, OK,

31:43.153 --> 31:45.237
Dickless Dickleby?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.903
You do what I say.

31:46.986 --> 31:49.028
Let others say what they want,
but we stay dark.

31:49.111 --> 31:52.237
You get me? No reporting
on what went down yesterday,

31:52.320 --> 31:53.487
the turmoil.

31:53.570 --> 31:55.153
Well, I can do
whatever I want,

31:55.237 --> 31:56.820
because Vaulter
and our satellite sites

31:56.903 --> 31:58.945
have editorial independence...

31:59.028 --> 32:01.153
as set out in
that piece of paper you signed.

32:01.237 --> 32:03.986
You know what
that piece of paper is to me?

32:04.070 --> 32:05.861
Nothing. OK?

32:05.945 --> 32:09.028
I'd jerk off on that paper
and send it to you
as a greeting card.

32:09.111 --> 32:11.570
Simon says: "Mum's the word,"

32:11.654 --> 32:13.237
motherfucker.

32:28.820 --> 32:31.820
Hey. Sorry to bother you
so late.

32:31.903 --> 32:34.195
Hey, let's put something
together

32:34.278 --> 32:36.362
about the Roy family shitshow.

32:36.445 --> 32:39.070
Shiv:
So, and I don't
want to get into this,

32:39.153 --> 32:41.320
but maybe we should just

32:41.403 --> 32:43.403
cut off the whole
Kendall CEO thing

32:43.487 --> 32:46.195
so that it doesn't get painful.

32:46.278 --> 32:48.986
Well, I mean,
I'm not looking for it,

32:49.070 --> 32:51.111
but I guess I'm already COO,

32:51.195 --> 32:52.737
so one more step...

32:52.820 --> 32:54.695
It's not gonna be you.

32:54.779 --> 32:57.445
- Come on.

32:57.529 --> 33:00.028
- I don't know what that means.
- Yes, you do.

33:00.111 --> 33:02.237
Well, it doesn't matter
who does it.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.695
It's just temporary,
so anyone will do.

33:04.779 --> 33:06.861
Yeah, sure. Anyone.

33:06.945 --> 33:08.362
- Tom.

33:08.445 --> 33:11.028
- OK, fine.

33:13.153 --> 33:14.612
Karl.

33:14.695 --> 33:16.111
Bleahh.

33:16.195 --> 33:19.237
Roman:
Prick. Eva?

33:19.320 --> 33:20.612
- Cunt.
- OK.

33:20.695 --> 33:21.903
So, who?

33:21.986 --> 33:24.111
Someone Dad trusts.

33:24.195 --> 33:26.028
But Dad doesn't trust anyone,
except Frank,

33:26.111 --> 33:28.487
and he fired Frank
for shits and giggles.

33:30.195 --> 33:31.737
- Uhh...

33:31.820 --> 33:33.820
I don't love Gerri.

33:33.903 --> 33:36.111
But I don't hate Gerri.

33:36.195 --> 33:37.903
So, Gerri.

33:37.986 --> 33:39.654
I'll talk to her.

33:44.445 --> 33:46.403
So, Gerri.

33:46.487 --> 33:47.861
How ya doin'?

33:47.945 --> 33:50.237
Oh, I'm fine.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.111
This is where they brought
Baird, so it's a little...

33:53.195 --> 33:54.153
Baird?

33:54.237 --> 33:56.820
Yeah, Baird. My husband.

33:56.903 --> 33:58.945
Shiv's godfather?

33:59.028 --> 34:02.570
Oh, does he, um--
with the tortoise?

34:02.654 --> 34:03.654
Yeah.

34:03.737 --> 34:05.445
Fuck yeah, of course.

34:05.529 --> 34:08.278
- He's dead.

34:08.362 --> 34:11.737
I know. I know.
I remember... you--

34:15.153 --> 34:17.570
So, uh, Gerri, uh,

34:17.654 --> 34:22.945
just wanted to say thanks
for captaining us through
this shitstorm.

34:23.028 --> 34:26.654
Um, you do a good job,

34:26.737 --> 34:28.445
Gerri, you, uh,

34:28.529 --> 34:33.403
you're, um, you're
a real good job-doer.

34:33.487 --> 34:36.445
I suck at the whole
corporate flirt thing.

34:36.529 --> 34:37.737
You know, I just--

34:37.820 --> 34:40.654
I like to lube up and fuck,
you know?

34:40.737 --> 34:42.445
OK.
- OK.

34:42.529 --> 34:46.237
So, um... for me and Shiv,

34:46.320 --> 34:50.278
the whole Kendall thing
doesn't work.

34:50.362 --> 34:53.820
So we were thinkin'--
general counsel--

34:53.903 --> 34:55.820
you know where
the bodies are buried.

34:55.903 --> 34:58.028
You probably buried 'em
yourself.

34:58.111 --> 34:59.903
So...

34:59.986 --> 35:01.986
you would have
the family's support

35:02.070 --> 35:03.903
to step in and take the reins.

35:05.445 --> 35:07.153
That's a very generous offer,

35:07.237 --> 35:10.028
but I'm going
to have to decline.

35:10.111 --> 35:11.654
Um...

35:11.737 --> 35:14.529
OK. Can, uh, can I ask why?

35:14.612 --> 35:18.362
Why I don't want the job
that makes your brain explode?

35:18.445 --> 35:21.820
OK, but, um, uh...

35:21.903 --> 35:23.861
G-Gerri, excuse me,

35:23.945 --> 35:25.737
but I-- I've always
thought of you--

35:25.820 --> 35:28.195
and I mean this
in the best possible way--

35:28.278 --> 35:31.445
as a stone-cold killer bitch.

35:31.529 --> 35:34.612
Who says you don't know
how to flirt?

35:58.111 --> 35:59.278
OK.

36:18.945 --> 36:22.237
Hey. Can I get
a moment alone with you,
do you think?

36:22.320 --> 36:24.654
- I...

36:24.737 --> 36:26.570
I'm so sorry
about your father.

36:26.654 --> 36:28.903
Thank you.
Would you give us a minute?

36:28.986 --> 36:30.986
Yeah.

36:31.070 --> 36:32.986
- Connor: Thanks, Willa.
- Mm-hmm.

36:34.153 --> 36:36.153
Tom, would you mind?

36:36.237 --> 36:38.779
Oh, come on.
I'm not the same as her.

36:38.861 --> 36:42.362
- Ken.

36:42.445 --> 36:45.570
Vaulter's running a story
about how the company's
in turmoil.

36:45.654 --> 36:47.320
Don't we own him?

36:47.403 --> 36:49.570
"Shit Show
at the Fuck Factory"?

36:49.654 --> 36:50.945
Yeah. Uncertainty, discord.

36:51.028 --> 36:52.737
That is not a good story.

36:52.820 --> 36:55.529
"Family gets behind
other member of family,"

36:55.612 --> 36:56.695
that's a good story.

36:56.779 --> 36:58.237
Oh, fuck them.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.861
I mean, when Jobs was dying,
Apple didn't say anything.

37:00.945 --> 37:03.195
We're in a hospital, Shiv.
Everyone knows.

37:03.278 --> 37:05.612
We can't just prop him up
and wave his hand

37:05.695 --> 37:09.487
and say he's fine
like they did in the Politburo
or Weekend at fuckin' Bernie's.

37:09.570 --> 37:11.820
I like the sound
of that, though.

37:11.903 --> 37:13.195
Look,

37:13.278 --> 37:16.278
you can't put a value
on a human life,

37:16.362 --> 37:19.320
except in our case,
you rather precisely can

37:19.403 --> 37:22.237
because when trading
opens tomorrow, we're
gonna drop like a stone.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.570
The only question is,
what's the bottom?

37:27.362 --> 37:29.195
I think I'm the best option.

37:31.779 --> 37:34.153
I just want to say that, uh,

37:34.237 --> 37:37.570
if you need me to...
go get sandwiches or coffee

37:37.654 --> 37:41.820
or  step up from Regional Parks
and run North America, I can,

37:41.903 --> 37:44.195
and I will. And that's
just an offer on the table--

37:44.278 --> 37:46.445
- Fuck off, Tom.
- Fuck you,  Kendall.

37:46.529 --> 37:49.153
- Don't talk to Tom like that.
- It's OK. It's fine.

37:49.237 --> 37:51.403
I was about to be announced.

37:51.487 --> 37:54.654
I mean, how can I not
be the logical choice?

37:54.737 --> 37:57.445
Because you were
about  to be announced,
Ken, and then you weren't.

37:57.529 --> 38:00.570
I mean, the only thing
we know for certain,
like for absolute  certain,

38:00.654 --> 38:02.945
tonight, is that Dad didn't
want you running the company.

38:03.028 --> 38:05.654
So if there was a list
of 7 billion people
on this planet

38:05.737 --> 38:07.529
that Dad would choose
to be boss,

38:07.612 --> 38:08.570
we know you would be last.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.612
Dad fired you, man.

38:10.695 --> 38:12.070
No, he did not fire me.

38:12.153 --> 38:14.028
He said it was just
gonna take a little longer.

38:14.111 --> 38:16.028
But he said that to be nice.

38:16.111 --> 38:19.903
What I think he meant to say
was that he wished that Mom
gave birth to a can opener

38:19.986 --> 38:22.945
because at least then
it would be useful.

38:23.028 --> 38:24.195
Kendall:
You're a dick.

38:24.278 --> 38:25.986
- That's...

38:26.070 --> 38:28.153
Look, the board
are offering this to me.

38:28.237 --> 38:30.487
I don't actually
need your backing.

38:30.570 --> 38:32.570
You actually really,
totally do.

38:32.654 --> 38:34.111
I think you do.

38:34.195 --> 38:36.861
Without it,
after what Dad did to you,

38:36.945 --> 38:39.487
I mean, we could probably
take any appointment to court.

38:39.570 --> 38:41.487
Jesus, Shiv, we're talking
about court now?

38:41.570 --> 38:43.195
Fuck you!

38:43.278 --> 38:45.779
I didn't even
want to talk about this,
remember?

38:45.861 --> 38:48.529
What do you--
What do you have
against me?

38:48.612 --> 38:51.070
- Nothing.

38:51.153 --> 38:53.195
Oh, you want me
to actually say?

38:53.278 --> 38:55.737
- Yes, I do.
- You lack killer instinct,

38:55.820 --> 38:58.403
you're wet, you're green,
you're intellectually
insecure,

38:58.487 --> 38:59.737
Bullshit.

38:59.820 --> 39:01.320
you're not emotionally
strong enough,

39:01.403 --> 39:03.487
- you have addiction issues.
- That's enough!

39:03.570 --> 39:05.737
I don't think all that,
I'm just trying to be
Dad's voice.

39:05.820 --> 39:08.570
Bravo. It was
an excellent impression.

39:08.654 --> 39:10.070
I just want to say
I'm not getting involved.

39:10.153 --> 39:11.028
Kendall: Good.

39:11.111 --> 39:12.570
But Shiv's right.

39:12.654 --> 39:14.654
I'm not saying I would make
a better CEO,

39:14.737 --> 39:15.986
that's unsaid--

39:16.070 --> 39:17.612
It's not unsaid
when you say it.

39:17.695 --> 39:19.654
No, I'm saying
I'm not saying it,

39:19.737 --> 39:21.195
so, in fact, it is unsaid.

39:21.278 --> 39:23.903
Hey, pal, why don't you
go help Willa with her homework?

39:23.986 --> 39:25.654
Ouch. Asshole.

39:25.737 --> 39:28.111
Listen, why don't you
decide everything.

39:28.195 --> 39:29.945
I don't care.
I just observe.

39:30.028 --> 39:31.779
I'm a UN white helmet.
All right?

39:31.861 --> 39:32.820
Guys--

39:32.903 --> 39:34.320
who else are you gonna get?

39:34.403 --> 39:36.445
I think Shiv would be great.

39:36.529 --> 39:37.779
That's what I think.

39:37.861 --> 39:39.445
Thanks, honey,

39:39.529 --> 39:42.111
but... no way.

39:42.195 --> 39:44.570
I mean, she doesn't work
in the company

39:44.654 --> 39:46.153
and has no experience
of the company

39:46.237 --> 39:47.362
and the markets would freak,

39:47.445 --> 39:48.612
but apart from that,
I agree with you.

39:48.695 --> 39:50.779
I mean, we have options.

39:50.861 --> 39:52.695
Sure. You could all
ask for morphine

39:52.779 --> 39:56.654
so you can stay
in your painless
fucking fantasy world

39:56.737 --> 40:00.278
where the orchids dance
and the company is run

40:00.362 --> 40:02.861
by a magical fucking unicorn!

40:08.070 --> 40:09.861
Fuck your options.

40:24.111 --> 40:25.861
Hello, this is Greg
on Greg's phone.

40:25.945 --> 40:27.570
- Yeah, I'm just, um,

40:27.654 --> 40:28.945
not dawdling.

40:29.028 --> 40:30.111
You're still at
the fucking apartment?

40:30.195 --> 40:31.445
You've been there forever.

40:31.529 --> 40:32.903
Uh, just, um--

40:32.986 --> 40:35.237
I know you're picking up
PJs and all that shit,

40:35.320 --> 40:39.153
just grab a sweater,
maybe, also. My dad's, OK?

40:39.237 --> 40:41.903
- It doesn't matter.

40:41.986 --> 40:44.695
Not something washed.
Something that he's worn, maybe.

40:44.779 --> 40:45.820
- If you find one.
- OK, yeah.

40:45.903 --> 40:47.695
If he's worn it, if his--

40:47.820 --> 40:49.153
How am I gonna know
if it's worn?

40:49.237 --> 40:50.695
Just smell it. OK?

40:50.779 --> 40:52.986
Jesus! I just want something
that smells like him, OK?

40:53.070 --> 40:54.362
I just want that.
Is that enough for you?

40:54.445 --> 40:55.903
Dude, that's really nice.

40:55.986 --> 40:59.195
I would want that
if this was my situation, too.

40:59.278 --> 41:01.445
So I'll sniff some stuff
for you--

41:01.529 --> 41:03.779
Just-- Whatever. And if you
tell anyone about this,

41:03.861 --> 41:05.362
I will... cut your dick off.

41:05.445 --> 41:07.529
And don't forget those papers
I told you to bring.

41:07.612 --> 41:08.695
And, uh, thank you.

41:08.779 --> 41:09.612
Fuck off.

41:10.695 --> 41:12.779
- Yeah.

41:32.612 --> 41:36.278
I... apologize
if my bell summoned you.

41:41.487 --> 41:43.570
Hey.

41:43.654 --> 41:44.861
Hey.

41:44.945 --> 41:46.737
It's, um...

41:46.820 --> 41:49.028
- It's like 4:00 a.m.
- Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

41:49.111 --> 41:52.612
Put the kids to bed and thought
I was missing all the fun, so...

41:52.695 --> 41:53.945
How are they doing?

41:54.028 --> 41:55.779
- Yeah.

41:55.861 --> 41:58.903
Um...

41:58.986 --> 42:00.654
they're OK.

42:05.903 --> 42:07.903
Maybe you could
bring them by tomorrow.

42:07.986 --> 42:13.278
So they can say their--
you know, say their... hellos.

42:13.362 --> 42:14.861
- Yeah.
- OK.

42:17.695 --> 42:19.529
How are you feeling?

42:19.612 --> 42:21.695
Good. Yeah.

42:23.195 --> 42:25.612
Yeah.
How am I feeling?

42:25.695 --> 42:27.986
Fuck. Ask me another?

42:28.070 --> 42:32.153
- Jesus, what a day for you.
- Yeah.

42:32.237 --> 42:36.945
The nominating committee
want me to be the big boss.

42:37.028 --> 42:38.903
Really?

42:38.986 --> 42:42.362
But Shiv and Roman
won't back me

42:42.445 --> 42:44.111
because of what Dad said
at lunch.

42:44.195 --> 42:46.779
Jesus.

42:46.861 --> 42:50.153
- Yeah.
- Ah, your family is so...

42:50.237 --> 42:51.320
fucked.

42:51.403 --> 42:53.945
I'm sorry, but-- Wow.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.737
I'm sorry.

43:20.695 --> 43:22.070
Um...

43:23.487 --> 43:26.737
Ken, I

43:28.320 --> 43:31.153
What can I say?
It's-- I don't know.

43:31.237 --> 43:32.737
Adrenaline.

43:33.986 --> 43:36.529
It's just my body.

43:36.612 --> 43:38.111
Hey.

43:38.195 --> 43:39.820
I'm glad you're here.

43:39.903 --> 43:42.445
Yeah. I can tell.

43:59.195 --> 44:01.820
- Hey. Look. Stop. Stop.
- No. I'm not in the mood.

44:01.903 --> 44:03.654
There's something
I have to say to you.

44:03.737 --> 44:05.861
- Siobhan Roy...

44:05.945 --> 44:07.695
Oh, my God.

44:07.779 --> 44:08.861
...will you marry me?

44:08.945 --> 44:12.070
What... the fuck?
Seriously?

44:12.153 --> 44:14.028
I love you.

44:14.111 --> 44:16.570
And I wanted to do something
to make all this better.

44:16.654 --> 44:20.570
And I thought while
your dad's still with us,
wouldn't that be a nice thing?

44:20.654 --> 44:22.070
We can get a quick wedding.

44:22.153 --> 44:25.195
What is it about my dad dying
in a sterile environment

44:25.278 --> 44:27.153
that screams big
romantic gesture to you?

44:30.153 --> 44:32.237
Well, it's a horrible day,
I thought--

44:32.320 --> 44:34.195
thought it would be
a nice... thing.

44:34.278 --> 44:35.903
Tom, you can't
balance it out like that.

44:35.986 --> 44:40.278
I'm not gonna...
give you a blow job
when your dog dies.

44:40.362 --> 44:41.861
Right?

44:44.986 --> 44:46.612
Yeah. OK.

44:46.695 --> 44:49.487
It's fine.
I misjudged it.
I get it.

44:49.570 --> 44:52.654
No, I'm s-sorry.
Honey, I'm sorry.

44:52.737 --> 44:55.111
I'm-- This is--

44:57.320 --> 44:59.529
Let's just not have this
as the moment.

44:59.612 --> 45:02.111
Why don't you do this again
properly another time.

45:02.195 --> 45:03.695
No! Exactly.
This is not the moment.

45:03.779 --> 45:06.237
This didn't happen.
Abort. Abort, abort,

45:06.320 --> 45:07.861
Good. OK.

45:12.861 --> 45:14.945
But so you know,

45:15.028 --> 45:16.153
uh...

45:16.237 --> 45:17.278
yeah, whatever.

45:17.362 --> 45:18.903
Yes?
- Yeah.

45:18.986 --> 45:20.278
When it happens, yes.

45:20.362 --> 45:21.612
Yes? Yes!

45:28.153 --> 45:29.903
- Yeah. I--

45:32.195 --> 45:33.654
Yeah.

45:37.028 --> 45:40.278
- It's such a shitshow.

45:40.362 --> 45:42.195
My family.

45:42.278 --> 45:43.570
Our  family.

45:45.570 --> 45:47.362
- Our family.
- Yeah.

46:03.945 --> 46:05.737
Hey, hey, hey.

46:07.237 --> 46:09.153
So I got the slippers.

46:09.237 --> 46:10.111
Thank you.

46:10.195 --> 46:11.612
Yeah, I finally found 'em.

46:11.695 --> 46:13.570
Can you put them
in there, please?

46:14.903 --> 46:16.195
Yeah.

46:32.986 --> 46:35.570
So, you got the slippers.

46:35.654 --> 46:36.903
Uh-huh.

46:36.986 --> 46:38.903
I guess that makes you
Prince Charming.

46:38.986 --> 46:40.195
I guess so.

46:40.278 --> 46:42.529
You saying you want
to fuck Marcia?

46:42.612 --> 46:47.195
What?! No.
Wh

46:47.278 --> 46:48.654
That's what you just said.

46:48.737 --> 46:49.861
No. It isn't.

46:49.945 --> 46:51.320
You said
you were Prince Charming.

46:51.403 --> 46:53.695
- No, you just said that.
- I'm kidding.

46:53.779 --> 46:54.986
I'm kidding.

46:55.070 --> 46:58.111
OK.

47:00.070 --> 47:02.612
Do you know that, uh--

47:02.695 --> 47:04.195
Do you know
that he gave me a job?

47:04.278 --> 47:05.445
What job?

47:05.529 --> 47:07.654
- I don't know.
- OK.

47:07.737 --> 47:09.487
- No. Obviously I don't know.

47:09.570 --> 47:11.403
- I don't know.

47:11.487 --> 47:14.070
I thought you might know
'cause I thought
everybody's talking

47:14.153 --> 47:16.070
and, like, might be
talking about me?

47:16.153 --> 47:19.237
No, everybody
was talking about you
this whole time.

47:19.320 --> 47:22.320
Everyone was only
talking about you,
Cousin Greg.

47:24.487 --> 47:26.028
I get it.

47:26.111 --> 47:27.195
Ha ha.

47:27.278 --> 47:28.529
Hey. Hey.

47:30.028 --> 47:33.111
When you, uh,
figure all this out,

47:33.195 --> 47:36.028
come in and see me. OK?

47:36.111 --> 47:38.445
And, uh,
and I'll look after you.

47:38.529 --> 47:40.945
All right?

47:41.028 --> 47:43.570
I'm serious. I will.

47:43.654 --> 47:46.320
- Sure.
- Thanks, man.

47:46.403 --> 47:47.403
That's OK.

47:50.861 --> 47:51.986
All right, later.

47:52.070 --> 47:53.070
Take it easy, Greg.

48:07.695 --> 48:09.654
Yo, come here for a second.

48:11.779 --> 48:14.654
So, listen.

48:14.737 --> 48:16.445
I've been thinking...

48:16.529 --> 48:19.529
and this is my vision:
We got for it. Me and you.

48:19.612 --> 48:22.278
CEO and COO.

48:22.362 --> 48:24.570
- Oh.
- Me and my homey Romey.

48:24.654 --> 48:26.612
I thought I was a fuckhead.

48:26.695 --> 48:29.111
Uh, dipshit,
and you said that.

48:29.195 --> 48:31.403
You said I wasn't serious.

48:31.487 --> 48:33.445
Sorry.
It's been a long day.

48:33.529 --> 48:34.403
Yeah.

48:34.487 --> 48:37.278
But dude, seriously.

48:37.362 --> 48:38.986
Me and you, bro.

48:39.070 --> 48:40.820
Like, I could teach you.

48:40.903 --> 48:43.278
And you could,
you know, teach me.

48:45.070 --> 48:46.529
And Shiv?

48:46.612 --> 48:48.195
I mean, you know
what Shiv's like.

48:48.278 --> 48:51.153
Ultimately
she's a daddy's girl.
Right?

48:51.237 --> 48:53.195
I mean, she wants
to play it safe.

48:53.278 --> 48:56.695
We're the ones with the nuts
to fuckin' revolutionize.

48:58.737 --> 49:01.570
OK, I'm not uninterested.

49:01.654 --> 49:03.612
All right, then,
let's fuckin' do it.

49:03.695 --> 49:07.195
Here's the thing.
Gerri just turned down
the top job.

49:07.278 --> 49:09.237
So does that mean something?

49:09.320 --> 49:11.861
Are you fuckin' with me?

49:11.945 --> 49:13.445
Nope.

49:13.529 --> 49:15.195
Who asked Gerri?

49:15.278 --> 49:17.861
It was broached.

49:17.945 --> 49:19.820
- Yeah.

49:19.903 --> 49:22.028
By who
You broached it, didn't you?

49:22.111 --> 49:26.111
Don't pin the broach on me,
OK? Everyone was broaching.

49:28.529 --> 49:30.695
Just want to make sure
we trust each other.

49:30.779 --> 49:32.945
Everything up front, OK?

49:34.153 --> 49:35.153
All right.

49:35.237 --> 49:36.320
OK.

49:37.403 --> 49:39.153
Shake on it
or something?

49:39.237 --> 49:40.362
Official?

49:40.445 --> 49:42.153
Oh. OK.

49:54.820 --> 49:55.986
Connor: Hi.

50:06.654 --> 50:07.695
Oh, come on.

50:07.779 --> 50:10.320
Hey. Hey, knock it off.

50:14.779 --> 50:16.153
Thank you, Willa.

50:26.529 --> 50:31.237
So, listen, I've asked Roman
to be acting COO...

50:31.320 --> 50:33.986
- Roman: Actual COO.
- ...to my acting CEO.

50:36.487 --> 50:38.403
- Snake.
- Sis, please,

50:38.487 --> 50:41.070
I'm trying to bring
everyone together here.
I'm mediating.

50:41.153 --> 50:43.070
- Well, I'm saying no.
- Me too.

50:43.153 --> 50:45.111
I thought you were
a fucking white helmet.

50:45.195 --> 50:48.945
Sometimes a peacekeeper
has to go shoot a maniac
on the perimeter, OK?

50:49.028 --> 50:51.654
What the fuck?
Why would you say no to this
and yes to Gerri?

50:51.737 --> 50:55.445
Gerri has been with the company
for 20 years. Dad trusts her.

50:55.529 --> 50:57.403
She's older. She's wiser.
She's a mature person--

50:57.487 --> 50:58.737
such as myself.

50:58.820 --> 51:01.111
Uh-huh. Well,
she doesn't want it.

51:01.195 --> 51:03.445
OK, so in my opinion,
we should find someone else.

51:03.529 --> 51:05.362
- Temporary.

51:05.445 --> 51:08.320
I don't know,
someone neutral.

51:08.403 --> 51:11.362
Eva or...
American Psycho, what--

51:11.445 --> 51:13.487
- Roman: Karl.
- Connor: Karl. Yeah.

51:13.570 --> 51:14.986
And what if it isn't temporary,

51:15.070 --> 51:16.861
what if he uses his position
to make it permanent?

51:16.945 --> 51:20.278
Because he wouldn't do that.
He's nice! He brought coffee.

51:20.362 --> 51:22.529
Kendall:
Oh, he brought coffee.

51:22.612 --> 51:25.028
Then we should definitely
let him take control
of the company.

51:25.111 --> 51:26.779
Dude, he's not gonna
take control of the company.

51:26.861 --> 51:28.278
Look, it's a gamble.

51:28.362 --> 51:31.195
It's either me and Roman
and us as a family,

51:31.278 --> 51:33.195
or it's Eva and Karl,

51:33.278 --> 51:37.111
or some fuckface suit
from the Deep State
of the company.

51:37.195 --> 51:38.986
They could take the company
out of our hands,

51:39.070 --> 51:40.529
and we'd never
get near it again.

51:40.612 --> 51:42.612
If Dad wakes up,
and he's frail,

51:42.695 --> 51:44.111
and he's looking
at the end game,

51:44.195 --> 51:45.695
you want to be the one
who tells him

51:45.779 --> 51:48.362
his family business
isn't family

51:48.445 --> 51:50.654
I mean, maybe you
could get away with it--

51:50.737 --> 51:52.820
- you know, his favorite.
- Oh, fuck you.

51:52.903 --> 51:54.487
But maybe you wouldn't
stay his favorite

51:54.570 --> 51:56.320
if you gave away the firm.

51:57.903 --> 52:00.945
Look, we need a statement
by 6:30.

52:02.362 --> 52:05.237
So you just have to think--

52:05.320 --> 52:07.861
like, bullshit aside--

52:07.945 --> 52:12.445
who do you think, really,
Dad would prefer?

52:51.403 --> 52:53.737
What's up, fam?

52:53.820 --> 52:58.195
Oh. Yeah. Um...
did you get the papers?

52:58.278 --> 52:59.612
- The pap--

52:59.695 --> 53:02.070
The papers in the envelope?
I called you?

53:02.153 --> 53:04.986
Dude-- Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

53:05.070 --> 53:06.487
So no, basically?

53:06.570 --> 53:08.070
I was thinking
about your dad,

53:08.153 --> 53:10.237
- I was up there--
- Hey, don't worry about it.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.986
My head was just
messed up.

53:24.654 --> 53:28.070
OK. We're gonna
have to announce.
Where are we at?

53:33.278 --> 53:36.278
While Dad is ill,
the family proposes
that Kendall run the company

53:36.362 --> 53:38.278
with Roman as COO.

53:38.362 --> 53:41.111
I hereby concur.

53:41.195 --> 53:42.737
OK. OK, uh..

53:42.820 --> 53:44.820
I will let the committee know
the family's position,

53:44.903 --> 53:48.320
and pending board approval,
we can announce.

53:48.403 --> 53:50.278
- Congratulations, Ken.
- Thanks, Gerri.

53:50.362 --> 53:51.779
And Roman, congratulations.

53:51.861 --> 53:53.111
Eva:
This is all very exciting.

53:53.195 --> 53:54.320
Karl:
Difficult decision.

53:54.403 --> 53:55.945
For the record,

53:56.028 --> 53:58.570
I personally believe this
to be a total fucking disaster.

53:59.903 --> 54:01.487
OK, good.

54:01.570 --> 54:04.028
Gerri:
Kendall, um, listen,

54:04.111 --> 54:05.320
we need to talk.

54:05.403 --> 54:06.820
I'm sorry, I just need to...

54:06.903 --> 54:08.945
I just need a conversation
with you in private.

54:09.028 --> 54:11.153
- Um...

54:11.237 --> 54:14.237
There's a few things
you should know.

54:14.320 --> 54:17.487
Um... ...

54:17.570 --> 54:19.153
OK, there's no way
to put this nicely,

54:19.237 --> 54:21.986
so forgive me for
stating it baldly,

54:22.070 --> 54:25.654
but, um,
there's a huge debt problem.

54:25.737 --> 54:27.986
What are you--
No.

54:28.070 --> 54:30.237
- Yes. Three billion.
- No, there's not.

54:30.320 --> 54:33.153
Fuck off.
I'd know.

54:33.237 --> 54:34.612
No one knows.

54:34.695 --> 54:36.445
Well, me and Frank.

54:36.529 --> 54:37.612
What about... Dad?

54:37.695 --> 54:39.028
Yeah, your dad.

54:39.111 --> 54:40.529
Hence the debt.

54:40.612 --> 54:42.654
Gerri, what the fuck
is going on?

54:42.737 --> 54:43.737
Where did the money go?

54:43.820 --> 54:45.153
In 1985,

54:45.237 --> 54:48.737
Logan needed cash badly
for the expansion into parks,

54:48.820 --> 54:51.695
so he took out a loan through
the family holding company.

54:51.779 --> 54:53.695
He knew that besides Frank,

54:53.779 --> 54:55.861
none of the other boards members
could see what was happening.

54:55.945 --> 55:01.195
And then he added that loan
to the company's
already considerable debt.

55:01.278 --> 55:03.529
Son of a bitch.

55:03.612 --> 55:04.945
OK.

55:06.654 --> 55:07.903
OK.

55:07.986 --> 55:09.779
We can deal.

55:09.861 --> 55:12.195
Yeah, but Kendall,
the thing is,

55:12.278 --> 55:15.779
it's secured against
Waystar's stock...

55:15.861 --> 55:18.028
and when the stock hits 130,

55:18.111 --> 55:20.737
they can pursue
repayment in full.

55:20.820 --> 55:23.070
Which, if they decided
to do that, would eviscerate us.

55:23.153 --> 55:25.153
Yeah, but there's
no precedent for that.
They'll never do that.

55:25.237 --> 55:26.654
They'll renegotiate.

55:26.737 --> 55:29.403
- Well, that depends.

55:29.487 --> 55:32.861
Well, you see,
the banks know that
the man they  invested in

55:32.945 --> 55:35.570
can no longer function,
and as far as they're concerned,

55:35.654 --> 55:38.487
you're just some kid
with nice hair.

55:40.237 --> 55:41.403
You're making it
quite fucking difficult

55:41.487 --> 55:43.153

Gerri.

55:44.237 --> 55:45.820
I'm sorry about that.

Don't jump.
