WEBVTT

00:07.073 --> 00:11.276
Look at this turn.
That's a 45-degree angle
right there.

00:11.278 --> 00:14.313
Lamagno:
<i>Oh, we're twisting</i>
<i>the sisters?</i>

00:14.315 --> 00:17.282
- Welcome to
"from dusk till dawn."
- no way.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.485
This is a 30-acre
film studio here.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.754
So I kind of
shoot the movies here,
dream them up here.

00:21.756 --> 00:23.255
Yeah!

00:23.257 --> 00:26.191
It seems like texas
has its own independence.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.527
<i>You can sort of smell</i>
<i>gasoline in the air,</i>

00:28.529 --> 00:30.729
<i>But it still has, like,</i>
<i>a super artsy vibe to it.</i>

00:30.731 --> 00:32.765
Holy!

00:34.667 --> 00:36.535
Alamo.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.637
Lamagno:
It's home on
the range, baby.

00:58.224 --> 01:01.627
Reedus:
<i>You know, I remember seeing</i>
<i>texas in the movies.</i>

01:01.629 --> 01:06.231
<i>I was around 14, 15</i>
<i>and just waiting for</i>
<i>something to happen.</i>

01:06.233 --> 01:09.134
<i>There was james dean</i>
<i>in "giant"</i>

01:09.136 --> 01:11.537
<i>Standing 15 feet tall</i>
<i>and looking badass as hell</i>

01:11.539 --> 01:14.139
<i>Against this epic</i>
<i>landscape.</i>

01:15.809 --> 01:18.544
<i>So I watched every western</i>
<i>I could get my hands on,</i>

01:18.546 --> 01:22.147
<i>Just dreaming about texas.</i>

01:22.149 --> 01:25.517
<i>Everyone knows texas</i>
<i>is unlike anywhere else.</i>

01:25.519 --> 01:29.254
<i>There's a reason</i>
<i>it's been the home</i>
<i>of outlaws and renegades.</i>

01:29.256 --> 01:32.157
<i>It's got an independent </i>
<i>spirit that's still drawing</i>
<i>in artists,</i>

01:32.159 --> 01:35.494
<i>Musicians, and people who</i>
<i>just don't play by the rules.</i>

01:45.872 --> 01:48.841
<i>Austin really is like a home</i>
<i>away from home for me.</i>

01:48.843 --> 01:50.442
<i>I really like the city's</i>
<i>thriving art</i>

01:50.444 --> 01:52.711
<i>And the tech</i>
<i>and the music scenes.</i>

01:52.713 --> 01:55.681
<i>One of my favorite bands,</i>
<i>the well, they're gonna</i>
<i>play tonight.</i>

01:55.683 --> 01:57.749
<i>So I'm in town and I'm gonna</i>
<i>check them out.</i>

01:57.751 --> 02:00.452
<i>With a couple days off,</i>
<i>I'm jumping at the chance</i>

02:00.454 --> 02:02.888
<i>To take a short ride</i>
<i>to somewhere I've never</i>
<i>been before.</i>

02:04.290 --> 02:06.225
<i>I invited jake lamagno,</i>

02:06.227 --> 02:08.627
<i>A friend and new york-based</i>
<i>artist to meet me down here</i>

02:08.629 --> 02:11.396
<i>So we can ride some</i>
<i>of these texas back roads.</i>

02:12.866 --> 02:14.733
<i>We'll start our ride</i>
<i>here in austin,</i>

02:14.735 --> 02:16.869
<i>Then head west through</i>
<i>the hill country</i>

02:16.871 --> 02:19.238
<i>To ride the legendary</i>
<i>twisted sisters</i>

02:19.240 --> 02:22.808
<i>Before ending up</i>
<i>in san antonio.</i>

02:22.810 --> 02:26.211
<i>I got a tip about</i>
<i>a rising star on the custom</i>
<i>bike scene out there</i>

02:26.213 --> 02:28.847
<i>And I'm excited</i>
<i>to go check him out.</i>

02:32.352 --> 02:34.219
<i>Austin's easy riding,</i>

02:34.221 --> 02:36.755
<i>But hill country,</i>
<i>that's a whole other story.</i>

02:36.757 --> 02:41.593
<i>So I'm riding my custom</i>
<i>triumph tiger 800 xcx.</i>

02:41.595 --> 02:44.296
<i>With traction control</i>
<i>and a triple engine,</i>

02:44.298 --> 02:47.833
<i>It's the perfect bike</i>
<i>for twisty roads.</i>

02:52.906 --> 02:54.573
<i>Jake just got in</i>
<i>from new york</i>

02:54.575 --> 02:56.275
<i>And I'm meeting him</i>
<i>at pump project,</i>

02:56.277 --> 02:58.210
<i>A local gallery</i>
<i>and art collective.</i>

03:01.781 --> 03:03.916
<i>"hollywood"</i>
<i>playing on radio</i>

03:07.253 --> 03:09.288
- Yo.
- <i>Yo.</i>

03:09.290 --> 03:12.658
- Where are you?
-  <i>Over here.</i>

03:12.660 --> 03:14.560
what's up, buddy?

03:14.562 --> 03:16.795
- Hey, brother.
- Nice to see you, man.

03:16.797 --> 03:20.299
Reedus:
<i>Jake's a super talented mixed</i>
<i>media artist from new york.</i>

03:20.301 --> 03:22.668
<i>His art explores themes</i>
<i>of death and decay</i>

03:22.670 --> 03:26.638
<i>Through the use of</i>
<i>reclaimed wood, old hardware,</i>
<i>and precious metals.</i>

03:26.640 --> 03:31.210
<i>Jake's also a former</i>
<i>pro skater who just recently</i>
<i>got into biking.</i>

03:31.212 --> 03:33.378
<i>He hasn't ridden much</i>
<i>outside new york,</i>

03:33.380 --> 03:36.481
<i>So I'm looking forward</i>
<i>to getting him out on</i>
<i>that open road.</i>

03:37.450 --> 03:38.584
What are you working on?

03:38.586 --> 03:40.419
I decided
to make some targets

03:40.421 --> 03:43.755
And bring
some vintage targets
to play around with.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.792
You know, we're in texas.
Why not shoot some guns?

03:46.794 --> 03:48.961
You're making these
so we can go shoot
guns at them?

03:48.963 --> 03:51.830
Yeah, see what kind
of designs we can make
in them, then stretch them.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.566
Reedus:
<i>Shooting up homemade</i>
<i>targets, I love it.</i>

03:54.568 --> 03:56.401
<i>See, that's one</i>
<i>of the reasons we're friends.</i>

03:56.403 --> 03:58.704
This is kind of your thing,
like gold and silver.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.673
Gold, yeah.
This is sterling silver.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.676
And then this is 24--
well, 23-and-a-half-
karat gold.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.879
Is this like when you
eat chocolates that have
gold on them?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.948
Yeah, to be honest,
it's the same.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.284
-  <i>Eat it. </i>
<i>- Yeah, I mean,</i>
<i>  I'll eat it.</i>

04:12.286 --> 04:15.254
Egyptians ate it.
They lived forever.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.322
And we've never actually
been on a ride together.

04:17.324 --> 04:19.625
We haven't.
That's what's special
about this.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.561
I'm excited to be
just riding.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.363
Just to get out
on the open road,
you know?

04:24.365 --> 04:26.465
New york city
is a bit confined, so...

04:26.467 --> 04:29.935
- All right, finish up
here so we can roll.
- Let's do it.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.571
Reedus:
<i>There's one place here in</i>
<i>austin I keep hearing about--</i>

04:32.573 --> 04:34.940
<i>Limey bikes.</i>

04:34.942 --> 04:37.409
<i>They only work on</i>
<i>vintage japanese bikes,</i>

04:37.411 --> 04:40.812
<i>Which are known for their</i>
<i>groundbreaking design</i>
<i>and build quality.</i>

04:40.814 --> 04:43.715
Reedus:
<i>So I ask one of the owners</i>
<i>to meet us here</i>

04:43.717 --> 04:45.550
<i>And take us to his shop.</i>

04:45.552 --> 04:47.786
- Hey, elijah.
- <i>Hey.</i>

04:47.788 --> 04:49.855
Where are you?
How's it going, dude?

04:49.857 --> 04:51.657
How's it going?
Elijah, nice to meet you.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.425
Nice to meet you.
Is this your bike
out front?

04:53.427 --> 04:54.793
- Yeah.
- Show us your bike.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.863
<i>It's an old</i>
<i>xs 850 race engine</i>

04:57.865 --> 04:59.765
<i>Punched out to a 666 motor</i>

04:59.767 --> 05:00.866
Just 'cause it's kind
of a fun number.

05:00.868 --> 05:03.368
- It looks cool.
-  <i>Thanks, man.</i>

05:03.370 --> 05:05.604
- Show us limey bikes.
- Yeah, yeah, you guys want
to check out the shop?

05:05.606 --> 05:07.639
I would love to see it.
Show it to us.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.907
- <i>Yeah, let's go, man. </i>
<i>- Yeah, let's go. Let's go.</i>

05:08.909 --> 05:11.810
I love your laugh.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.612
- Thanks, man.
- How far away is it?

05:13.614 --> 05:15.080
It's like 10 minutes
up the road.

05:22.089 --> 05:26.525
Reedus:
<i>Jake's riding a vintage</i>
<i>1977 sportster</i>

05:26.527 --> 05:28.593
<i>That he just finished</i>
<i>fixing up.</i>

05:28.595 --> 05:30.962
<i>Since he's only ridden </i>
<i>it on city streets,</i>

05:30.964 --> 05:34.399
<i>This will be a great way</i>
<i>for him to open it up</i>
<i>and see how it rides.</i>

05:41.541 --> 05:43.442
That sounds like a car.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.676
Welcome to my shop.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.812
Wow, I like it.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.348
I like this el camino.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.086
Reedus:
<i>Are these all your bikes right</i>
<i>here that you work on?</i>

05:54.088 --> 05:56.922
- Elijah: <i>Yeah. </i>
<i>- I like this guy</i>
<i>  right here. Awesome.</i>

05:56.924 --> 05:59.524
Dude, you hear this from
cafe racer a lot, man.

05:59.526 --> 06:03.362
This is like 750 kit,
shell race cam, race carbs.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.963
We just retuned it.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.732
<i>It's a friggin' beast.</i>

06:06.734 --> 06:10.435
It's probably the only xs
that'll, you know, top 130.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.437
- Really?
- <i>Yeah, they're not</i>
<i> really built for it,</i>

06:12.439 --> 06:14.639
But this thing is
a squirrelly power monster.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.842
- It's really pretty, this bike.
- Chris: <i>Good morning.</i>

06:16.844 --> 06:18.977
- Yeah, so this is chris.
- Don't worry about that thing.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.780
- <i>This is the limey. </i>
<i>- How are you, dude? Norman.</i>

06:21.782 --> 06:23.615
- Fine, thank you.
- <i>Nice to meet you.</i>

06:23.617 --> 06:26.451
Reedus:
<i>Chris kelland is a british</i>
<i>motorcycle guru</i>

06:26.453 --> 06:28.520
<i>Who teamed up with elijah</i>
<i>four years ago.</i>

06:28.522 --> 06:30.422
<i>And their exclusively</i>
<i>vintage approach</i>

06:30.424 --> 06:31.990
<i>Is a huge hit</i>
<i>here in austin.</i>

06:31.992 --> 06:34.659
- Show us your bike.
- Elijah: <i>Yeah, check it out.</i>

06:40.700 --> 06:42.934
We pretty much resurrect
the dead most of the time.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.004
There's a lot of people
in austin that love the look

06:46.006 --> 06:48.140
<i>And the feel of these</i>
<i>old vintage bikes</i>

06:48.142 --> 06:50.909
And they try and--
well, they usually buy
them for way too much money

06:50.911 --> 06:53.044
And then we have
to fix them.

06:53.046 --> 06:56.014
- How old
is this guy right here?
- That one's a '66.

06:56.016 --> 06:59.751
Chris: <i>It's a 305 dream.</i>
<i>We're doing a partial</i>
<i>restoration on that one.</i>

06:59.753 --> 07:01.953
Elijah: <i>That's why</i>
<i>it's in so many pieces.</i>
<i>They're terrible to ride.</i>

07:01.955 --> 07:04.689
No suspension,
they bounce, there's no
dampening or anything.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.158
They just flop
around the road.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.460
The oldest japanese bike
we've ever worked on

07:08.462 --> 07:11.563
Is a 1954 maruichi,
which was actually
really difficult

07:11.565 --> 07:13.765
Because you cannot for love
nor money buy parts for it.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.502
We had to make a drive belt
out of basically a fan belt.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.638
- Yeah, a fan belt.
- That's like cuba.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.973
Like, if they need
a spark plug, they'll
build a spark plug.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.176
- Absolutely.
- Are you unique

07:24.178 --> 07:26.645
To having a shop in austin
that's doing this?

07:26.647 --> 07:28.914
Kind of the only people
that just do japanese.

07:28.916 --> 07:32.184
Yeah, we are the only shop
that specializes specifically
in vintage japanese.

07:32.186 --> 07:35.554
We cut off at '83.
So nothing past 1983.

07:35.556 --> 07:39.124
Shops that try to do
everything generally
don't do anything well.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.993
So I've always been a big
advocate of specialization.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.563
<i>Honestly, I love</i>
<i>the vintage stuff</i>
<i>for a number of reasons.</i>

07:44.565 --> 07:46.898
<i>I think,</i>
<i>well, first of all,</i>
<i>they look cool.</i>

07:46.900 --> 07:49.668
<i>Secondly, there's</i>
<i>a lot you can do to them</i>
<i>to make them your own.</i>

07:49.670 --> 07:52.003
It's just a labor
of love most of the time.

07:52.005 --> 07:55.507
There's something really
satisfying about bringing
a bike back from the dead.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.576
<i>A lot of the stuff</i>
<i>we deal with hasn't run</i>

07:57.578 --> 08:00.078
<i>In, like, 20, 30 years.</i>
<i>We do it all the time.</i>

08:00.080 --> 08:02.013
You see these things
at the airport--

08:02.015 --> 08:04.049
- Like, "keep austin weird."
- elijah: <i>Yeah.</i>

08:04.051 --> 08:07.586
Austin's texas,
but it's like its own
little thing.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.821
- Yeah.
- Explain that to me.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.557
Uh, it's a weird
dichotomy of, like--

08:12.559 --> 08:15.694
You know, you see,
like, very left-wing
political stickers

08:15.696 --> 08:18.029
On someone's lifted truck
with a shotgun in the back.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.932
- I have to say,
austin is pretty unique.
- It is, yeah.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.567
Elijah:
<i>It's why everyone's</i>
<i>moving here, man.</i>

08:22.569 --> 08:24.769
You can sort of smell
gasoline in the air,

08:24.771 --> 08:26.972
But it still has, like,
a super artsy vibe to it.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.708
Honestly, before I came
to texas,

08:29.710 --> 08:31.776
Generally, I really thought
everyone just rode a horse

08:31.778 --> 08:33.912
And had a shotgun
strapped to them.

08:33.914 --> 08:37.816
But, yeah, austin is quite
a surprise, I suppose.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.018
Reedus:
<i>I'm really impressed</i>
<i>with the artistic edge</i>

08:40.020 --> 08:41.753
<i>To what chris</i>
<i>and elijah do.</i>

08:41.755 --> 08:44.189
<i>The whole process</i>
<i>from scavenging for rare parts</i>

08:44.191 --> 08:45.290
<i>To frankensteining bikes.</i>

08:45.292 --> 08:47.192
- Thank you, guys.
- Oh!

08:47.194 --> 08:48.994
- Thanks, man.
- It was a pleasure, man.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.996
Reedus:
<i>When they can't find</i>
<i>what they need,</i>

08:50.998 --> 08:52.898
<i>What do they do?</i>
<i>They figure it out.</i>

08:52.900 --> 08:55.667
<i>I love that kind</i>
<i>of guerilla attitude.</i>

08:55.669 --> 08:59.004
<i>It's not often you find</i>
<i>people working on japanese</i>
<i>bikes anyway.</i>

08:59.006 --> 09:00.972
<i>It's a niche that</i>
<i>they're passionate about</i>

09:00.974 --> 09:02.841
<i>And they've made it</i>
<i>a success.</i>

09:02.843 --> 09:05.110
Lamagno:
<i>Thank you, I apprec-- oh!</i>

09:05.112 --> 09:07.579
Reedus:
<i>And they're also really</i>
<i>good to have around</i>

09:07.581 --> 09:09.180
<i>When your battery dies.</i>

09:09.182 --> 09:12.117
<i>Let me get a picture of you</i>
<i>fixing your motorcycle</i>

09:12.119 --> 09:13.885
<i>So I can, like,</i>
<i>give you.</i>

09:22.662 --> 09:23.962
<i>"rock boots" playing</i>

09:23.964 --> 09:26.164
That should do it.
It's a little jittery.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.067
Is it in there?
Staying in there?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.869
Thank you, brother.
Appreciate it.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.004
Thank you, my man.

<i>Director of two</i>
<i>of my favorite films--</i>

09:52.793 --> 09:54.359
<i>"el mariachi"</i>
<i>and "sin city."</i>

09:54.361 --> 09:56.928

10:12.079 --> 10:13.878
Reedus:
<i>I met robert through</i>
<i>greg nicotero,</i>

10:13.880 --> 10:16.281
<i>An executive producer</i>
<i>on "the walking dead."</i>

10:16.283 --> 10:18.850
<i>He told me that I had</i>
<i>to get down here and check</i>
<i>out robert's place.</i>

10:18.852 --> 10:20.318
<i>♪ I got to have it </i>

10:20.320 --> 10:22.654
<i>♪ rock and roll. </i>

10:25.324 --> 10:26.758
Oh, look at this road.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.627
Did you start making
films in texas

10:28.629 --> 10:29.961
- And just stay here?
- Yes. Yeah.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.796
That's "sin city"
and "sin city 2."

10:35.201 --> 10:37.135
<i>Holy!</i>

10:37.137 --> 10:39.871
So beautiful.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.214
The thing about it here
is you look like

10:49.216 --> 10:53.885
You're in some little
warehouse district that's
just businesses,

10:53.887 --> 10:55.987
And then there's some,
like, hip restaurant

10:55.989 --> 10:58.023
<i>Or some hip coffee shop.</i>

10:58.025 --> 10:59.824
This looks like a prison.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.330
Reedus:
<i>We're at troublemaker</i>
<i>studios,</i>

11:05.332 --> 11:09.801
<i>Home base of cinematic</i>
<i>mastermind robert rodriguez.</i>

11:09.803 --> 11:12.137
<i>1,300 miles away</i>
<i>from hollywood,</i>

11:12.139 --> 11:13.872
<i>Robert is</i>
<i>the ultimate renegade</i>

11:13.874 --> 11:16.341
<i>And he's got a rep</i>
<i>as a one-man film crew.</i>

11:16.343 --> 11:18.843
Yeah. Yeah.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.979
Welcome
to troublemaker studios.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.681
This is crazy.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.282
Let me take this off.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.451
- Good to see you, dude.
- Good to see you, brother.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.154
- Yeah, man.
- Finally. Finally we get to
meet up in austin.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.189
Yeah, dude.
Robert, this is jake.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.857
- Hey, how are you?
Good to meet you, man.
- How you doing, man?

11:35.928 --> 11:37.862
Reedus:
<i>How cool is this?</i>
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

11:37.864 --> 11:41.166
This is my green screen
I've had since--
about 15 years.

11:41.168 --> 11:44.169
I've done "sin city."
these green things here,
the stairs...

11:44.171 --> 11:46.905
- Yeah?
- That's "sin city"
and "sin city 2."

11:46.907 --> 11:48.306
Those are the sets.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.208
<i>The whole movie</i>
<i>was shot right here.</i>

11:50.210 --> 11:52.110
<i>It would just be a couple</i>
<i>of actors, maybe one prop,</i>

11:52.112 --> 11:54.112
<i>And everything else</i>
<i>was just imagined.</i>

11:54.114 --> 11:56.047
Reedus:
<i>It's crazy that I can see</i>
<i>it in my head now.</i>

11:56.049 --> 11:57.749
- Yeah, it's weird.
- You know what I mean?
It's wild.

11:59.151 --> 12:00.752
What was this,
an airplane hangar?

12:00.754 --> 12:02.887
This was the old airport.
This was a hangar

12:02.889 --> 12:04.389
Where they kept
the governor's plane
back in the day.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.925
This is a 30-acre
film studio here.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.794
So I kind of
shoot the movies here,
dream them up here.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.963
<i>You got everything</i>
<i>that you need to kind</i>
<i>of make a movie happen.</i>

12:11.965 --> 12:15.200
Everybody's been telling
me to come here and check--
like greg.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.902
Oh, yeah, our mutual
friend greg nicotero.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.473
Did you start
making films in texas
and just stay here?

12:21.475 --> 12:23.475
Yeah, I didn't think
I'd ever make money at this.

12:23.477 --> 12:26.444
I've been here 30 years.
I grew up in san antonio,
texas,

12:26.446 --> 12:29.881
<i>Then came up here</i>
<i>to go to the university</i>
<i>to go to the film school.</i>

12:29.883 --> 12:32.317
And, you know,
during my first year
of film school,

12:32.319 --> 12:34.352
I actually went
and made "el mariachi."

12:34.354 --> 12:37.055
And so I was just in
the business right away.

12:37.057 --> 12:40.191
So I've been in the business
a long time 'cause I started
really young.

12:40.193 --> 12:44.095
I was like 21.
We're beyond stuff
being done in hollywood

12:44.097 --> 12:47.098
'cause we were first
to shoot digital, to shoot
green screen type movies.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.102
3-d. We were the first
digital 3-d movie
back in 2002.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.239
We started shooting.
So, you know, we're always
thinking outside of the box

12:54.241 --> 12:56.407
- 'cause you live
outside of the box.
- Yeah, exactly.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.509
No one watching
what you're doing.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.110
I love
that you're so creative

12:59.112 --> 13:00.812
And you're the king.
You're, like, the boss.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.847
- right, right.
- You know what I mean?

13:02.849 --> 13:04.816
It's great.
It's like, you know,
"it's good to be the king."

13:04.818 --> 13:06.084
- You're the king.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:09.121 --> 13:12.791
This is the jesse james
bike he built me for
"grindhouse."

13:12.793 --> 13:14.559
He's always trying
to buy it back from me

13:14.561 --> 13:17.128
<i>'cause it's an amazing</i>
<i>piece of work.</i>

13:17.130 --> 13:20.298
And it's a sweet,
sweet ride.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.433
- Reedus: <i>Wow. </i>
<i>-</i> <i>Really, really well done.</i>

13:22.435 --> 13:25.003
- Can I sit on this?
- Sure, absolutely.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.005
It runs.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.940
This is crazy, bro.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.910
- God, it's just--
- it's-- I'm too short
for this.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.478
- This is a stretch for me.
- <i>It's a-- yeah.</i>

13:33.480 --> 13:35.313
<i>I mean, that's kind of</i>
<i>how they do it.</i>

13:35.315 --> 13:37.148
It's even a stretch for me
and they built it for me.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.917
<i>Oh, this one</i>
<i>is an el camino</i>

13:38.919 --> 13:41.886
That we gave to jesse
james to turn into a--

13:41.888 --> 13:45.356
I had seen these pictures
of cartels and drug
dealers in mexico

13:45.358 --> 13:47.358
- That would
armor their cars.
- Yeah.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.361
So we had him armor it.
So this is real.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.864
Jesse didn't know
it's like a movie prop.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.433
So be careful
'cause you can cut
your hands on this thing.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.271
- Does this run?
- Yeah, we use it.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.373
We jump it
in "machete kills."

14:02.375 --> 14:05.176
Wow.
Dude, this is like--

14:05.178 --> 14:08.446
<i>I understand why</i>
<i>you would never leave.</i>

14:08.448 --> 14:10.882
This is a fun place.

14:14.186 --> 14:19.057
- Oh, no way. No way.
- Welcome to "from dusk
till dawn."

14:19.059 --> 14:21.192
Wow. Dude.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.494
So this was
an amazing set

14:23.496 --> 14:27.031
We built in la
for the original film.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.601
<i>So when we did</i>
<i>the television series,</i>
<i>we had to rebuild the bar.</i>

14:29.603 --> 14:33.204
We rebuilt it
'cause we just like it.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.241
- Yeah.
- And we always use it.
Hey, I got some chow.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.278
Reedus:
<i>Dang, man, thanks</i>
<i>for the hospitality.</i>

14:40.280 --> 14:42.180
Rodriguez:
<i>Absolutely, man.</i>
<i>It's what we're all about.</i>

14:45.951 --> 14:47.085
Mm.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.220
<i>Wow.</i>

14:49.222 --> 14:51.389
<i>You guys do</i>
<i>taco everythings</i>
<i>out here, right?</i>

14:51.391 --> 14:54.525
- <i>Breakfast tacos. </i>
<i>- Oh, yeah, love</i>
<i>  breakfast tacos.</i>

14:56.629 --> 14:58.563
- <i>I just got the pepper. </i>
<i>- Mmm.</i>

14:58.565 --> 15:01.132
- <i>Pepper just hit me. </i>
<i>- It hits you.</i>

15:01.134 --> 15:03.635
Where you headed
in texas of all
the places?

15:03.637 --> 15:06.137
Yeah, we're going
to san antonio.

15:06.139 --> 15:09.207
- My hometown.
- Yeah, tell us some things
to see in san antonio.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.576
San antonio has
its own thing, I think,
from the rest of texas.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.078
I mean, it's one
of the biggest cities
in the country,

15:14.080 --> 15:16.281
But it's very different
from, say, houston
and dallas.

15:16.283 --> 15:19.117
And I find it
just very homey.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.519
It's partly because
my family's still there,
my parents are still there,

15:21.521 --> 15:25.390
But there's something really
kind of just very peaceful
and tranquil about it

15:25.392 --> 15:26.991
And just kind of beautiful.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.259
What about the alamo?
Do people--

15:28.261 --> 15:30.194
Oh, the alamo.
Yeah, it's a cool place,

15:30.196 --> 15:32.697
But you can see
why everybody got
slaughtered in there.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.465
The walls are so small.
You can hop over them.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.100
Reedus:
<i>It's tiny.</i>
<i>Like, a tiny little place.</i>

15:36.102 --> 15:38.136
There's no way that's
gonna fortify anything.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.672
Anyway, thanks, dude.
Thanks for the food
and the hospitality.

15:40.674 --> 15:43.041
- You're so awesome.
- Absolutely.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.976
- Thanks, guys.
See you soon, hopefully.
- Really appreciate it.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.111
- I want to be you
when I grow up.

15:51.050 --> 15:53.051
Did I tell you
I have a baby?

15:53.053 --> 15:55.153
- It's weird.
-          Looks just like         danny trejo.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.288
Oh, my god!

15:57.290 --> 15:59.557
, dude!

15:59.559 --> 16:01.292
That is adorable.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.294
He's got, like,
the full tattoos.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.331
Can I take a picture
just for myself?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.733
Oh, my god,
this is messed up, dude.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.473
On that note, wow.
Dude, thank you again.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.076
I can't say
it enough, dude.
Awesome, man.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.283
See you, dude.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.725
Reedus:
<i>Robert's passion for film</i>
<i>is contagious</i>

16:33.727 --> 16:37.428
<i>And I love that he's figured</i>
<i>out a way to do his own thing</i>
<i>so far from hollywood.</i>

16:40.299 --> 16:43.134
<i>That independence gives</i>
<i>his film that extra edge</i>

16:43.136 --> 16:45.603
<i>And that's one of the things</i>
<i>that makes him so special.</i>

16:45.605 --> 16:48.673
All right, let's go
see some bands.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.142
Go hear some music.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.685
Reedus:
<i>Austin is definitely known</i>
<i>for its music scene.</i>

17:00.687 --> 17:04.622
<i>And tonight</i>
<i>one of my favorite bands,</i>
<i>the well, are playing.</i>

17:04.624 --> 17:07.425
<i>I heard about these guys</i>
<i>a few years back.</i>

17:09.094 --> 17:11.629
<i>Their music is super raw</i>
<i>and electric.</i>

17:11.631 --> 17:13.498
<i>Now I get to finally</i>
<i>meet them.</i>

17:22.174 --> 17:24.375
Can I get
a jack and coke?

17:24.377 --> 17:27.145
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

17:27.147 --> 17:30.348
What's up? Hi.
I got jack and coke
all over my hands,

Wow, this is a cool spot.

- Jake, nice to meet you.
- We'll sit right here.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.127
- I'm excited.
- So what's up?

17:43.129 --> 17:45.263
Just touring
through austin.

17:45.265 --> 17:48.199
We came to austin.
We're going to san antonio,
I think, tomorrow.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.134
<i>Is this like a local spot</i>
<i>you guys play all the time?</i>

17:50.136 --> 17:52.537
Yeah, this is probably
one of my favorite
places to play.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.672
- Yeah, definitely.
- Is it? Oh, right on.

17:54.674 --> 17:58.309
Your song, "mortal bones,"
I love that song.

17:58.311 --> 18:01.145
- Well, we might
play it tonight.
- Yeah!

you know what I mean?

20:27.293 --> 20:28.993
But, like,
there's hills here.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.529
Beautiful, man.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.736
- Reedus: Wow,
look at this, dude.
- Breathtaking.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.304
This road,
it's so good.

20:51.384 --> 20:54.619
<i>One of the three</i>

20:54.621 --> 20:57.755
Look at this turn.
That's a 45-degree
angle right there.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.690
Oh, we're twisting
the sisters?

20:59.692 --> 21:02.326
Reedus:
<i>Three roads famous</i>

22:10.529 --> 22:12.997
Oh, look at this road.

22:12.999 --> 22:16.467
Look at this place.
Doesn't even look real.

22:21.606 --> 22:23.407
Could go for some
lunch soon.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.776
- Yeah, I'm a little hungry.
- Look at these places.

Let's grab this brisket.

22:51.404 --> 22:52.737
Oh, let's do that.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.075
- Hey, hi.
- How are you?

22:58.077 --> 22:59.710
- Jake. How are you?
Nice to meet you.
- Bill.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.712
Glad to meet you.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.981
Reedus:
<i>So we were told the brisket</i>

23:03.983 --> 23:06.117
What's your most popular?

23:06.119 --> 23:08.986
We sell more brisket
than anything else.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.621
Okay, I think I want
the brisket.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.656
And you do a sandwich
or just--

23:12.658 --> 23:15.025
You can have
either a sandwich

23:15.027 --> 23:18.028
Or you can have a plate
with potato salad and beans.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.731
- I think I'll do that.
- And I'll do the sandwich.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.067
- Okay.
- Thank you, man.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.469
Reedus:
<i>Can I take a photo?</i>
<i>I'm sort of--</i>

23:25.471 --> 23:27.605

23:27.607 --> 23:29.006
- Yeah, that's good.
- Yeah.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.741
I got this cool
lens going.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.910
I got this crazy

23:38.016 --> 23:40.117
It's cool.
That's cool, right?

23:45.991 --> 23:47.591
It's so big--
texas is so big.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.927
Like, you go from
one area to the next

23:49.929 --> 23:52.630
And it's completely--
it's the same, but it's
way different.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.934
Yeah.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.041
Yeah. What's in this

24:04.043 --> 24:06.076
I'm gonna check it out.
My name is norman.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.512

24:16.789 --> 24:19.924
Is this real?
"sailors make

24:19.926 --> 24:22.827
I wonder if this

- They made those in Italy.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.059
I was wondering if I
could get a picture
with you?

24:55.061 --> 24:56.827
- Of course.
- It's my birthday.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.697

25:01.968 --> 25:05.269
- Yeah. Happy birthday.
- Oh, my god, thank you.

25:05.271 --> 25:08.839

"down by law" or something.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.141
- Reedus: <i>What's up? </i>
<i>- Man:</i> <i>Hey, brother.</i>

She's all, "you got
the 'aequitas' tattoo.
You have to stop."

25:15.748 --> 25:17.515
Oh, you do?
Show it to me.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.817
- What?
- Yeah, my brother's got
the other one.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.285
He's locked up right now,
but he's got the other one.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.887
Same tattoo?
Right on.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.122
I've got "aequitas"
and he's got "veritas."

25:25.124 --> 25:27.224
- Yeah, man, yeah.
- All right, brother, it was
very nice meeting you.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.859
Nice to meet you.
Later, gator.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.662
Y'all take it easy,
you guys.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.864
- So should we just
jump on our bikes?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.833
Let's do that.
We'll cruise.

25:50.282 --> 25:54.552
You know, this kind
of reminds me of, like,
some sort of safari park.

25:54.554 --> 25:57.888
You know?
I honestly feel like
I'm about to see a zebra.

25:57.890 --> 26:01.759

26:31.791 --> 26:33.157
Dude, we're in
san antonio!

26:33.159 --> 26:35.759
- Smells like barbecue.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.162
You can dress up
your stock parts,
and that's what I've done.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.230
Want to see
chicken  bingo?

26:41.933 --> 26:43.667
- <i>You got a lot</i>
<i> of hair going on. </i>
<i>- Dude, I do.</i>

26:43.669 --> 26:45.736
And it's a pain in the butt
every time I put on a helmet.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.972
- Does it just
blow in the breeze?
- Basically, yeah.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.873
You'd think it would do that.
No, it just weighs too much.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.742
It just hangs straight down
unless you get on the highway.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.644
And then I look ridiculous
'cause it's just one...

26:53.646 --> 26:56.780
Can I weigh your hair?
I just want to see what
this would be like.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.649
Dude, you're not even
the first person to ask.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.651
Wow, you got a whole thing
going on right here.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.753
Yeah.

27:02.755 --> 27:05.389
- Wow. Good laugh,
by the way.
- Thanks, man.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.057
Where did you get
this laugh from?

27:07.059 --> 27:08.759
Yeah, I don't know.
When I was a kid,

27:08.761 --> 27:10.260
I never laughed,
like, out loud.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.296
<i>But somewhere</i>
<i>around 15 or 16,</i>

27:12.298 --> 27:14.365
We were imbibing
in something

27:14.367 --> 27:16.700
And I just started laughing
and couldn't stop.

27:16.702 --> 27:19.269
- And like ever since
then, it just stuck.
- It's awesome.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.805
Yeah, my laugh
is kind of like...

27:21.807 --> 27:24.008
you know what I mean?
Like the opposite.

31:08.100 --> 31:11.602
Reedus:
<i>Next stop, san antonio</i>
<i>western shooting.</i>

31:11.604 --> 31:13.637
<i>Before we start shooting,</i>
<i>we need to finish</i>

31:13.639 --> 31:16.073
<i>Those targets jake and I</i>
<i>started back in austin.</i>

31:18.610 --> 31:21.278
- Pop, pop.

31:22.947 --> 31:25.015
What do you do when
you hear that in new york?

31:30.321 --> 31:31.588
<i>"make your move" playing</i>

31:35.126 --> 31:37.027
Reedus:
<i>I'm a huge fan</i>
<i>of graffiti art.</i>

31:38.596 --> 31:40.397
<i>When I first moved</i>
<i>to new york,</i>

31:40.399 --> 31:42.299
<i>I was friends with a bunch</i>
<i>of graffiti artists</i>

31:42.301 --> 31:44.568
<i>And I've always</i>
<i>loved it ever since.</i>

31:44.570 --> 31:48.071
<i>♪ tell me what</i>
<i>you're gonna do ♪</i>

31:48.073 --> 31:50.140
<i>♪ when the sun</i>
<i>goes down... ♪</i>

31:50.142 --> 31:52.442
Close your eyes,

31:52.444 --> 31:54.478
- Ooh!

31:54.480 --> 31:56.246
Garbage.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.416
<i>♪ oh, make a move,</i>
<i>oh, make a move... ♪</i>

31:59.418 --> 32:01.285

32:01.287 --> 32:03.487
Gonna make this

32:03.489 --> 32:06.356
<i>♪ oh, make your move,</i>
<i>oh, make your move... ♪</i>

32:06.358 --> 32:08.959
Reedus:
<i>Can't say I've ever shot</i>
<i>anything I've tagged before.</i>

32:08.961 --> 32:10.527
<i>First time</i>
<i>for everything, I guess.</i>

32:12.563 --> 32:14.665
All right, let's go
learn about guns.

32:21.039 --> 32:22.606
Wow.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.207
<i>How's it going over here?</i>
<i>What's happening?</i>

32:24.209 --> 32:26.143
- You guys look
awesome, by the way.
- Thank you.

32:26.145 --> 32:29.413
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- Nice to meet you, bill. Hi.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.548
- Jake. How are you?
- Jake, pleasure
to meet you, sir.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.684
- How are you, sir?
Nice to meet you.
- How you doing, norman?

32:36.220 --> 32:37.988
You know,
we made these targets.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.590
Is it possible
to put them up and blow
some holes in them?

32:40.592 --> 32:43.026
- Is that all right?
- You can just staple them
up there and... Ptth.

32:43.028 --> 32:45.629
- Oh, that would be great.
That'd be awesome.
- We shoot it with white powder.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.565
Do you only
have older guns here?
Is that the specialty?

32:48.567 --> 32:52.369
Yeah, we only use
old west style guns here.

32:52.371 --> 32:53.971
All right.
All right.

32:53.973 --> 32:56.106
- And that stays
right there.
- You got it.

32:56.108 --> 32:59.343
Let's come on
down here and we'll get
you guys started.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.678
You look like the bad guy.
Are you the bad guy?

33:01.680 --> 33:04.348
I am the easiest going
good guy you'll ever
meet, partner.

33:04.350 --> 33:07.317
- I'm usually the bad guy.
- I know. Big fan, by the way.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.453
- Oh, thanks, man.
- My wife is going to be--

33:09.455 --> 33:11.455
- She's gonna be pissed
that she wasn't here.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.657
It was real typical
in the old west

33:13.659 --> 33:15.726
That they
would load five.

33:15.728 --> 33:18.061
So I loaded one,
skipped one.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.099
<i>And finished loading</i>
<i>it on out.</i>

33:22.101 --> 33:24.768
And I pull the hammer
on back to do a full cock.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.670
Rotated the cylinder
one time.

33:26.672 --> 33:29.272
Flush this way
and centered in
the little notch.

33:29.274 --> 33:31.241
- Okay.
- And you build
an ice cream cone.

33:31.243 --> 33:34.044
Whatever you want
to shoot sits on top.
This is your cone.

33:34.046 --> 33:36.246
<i>oop, missed the head.</i>

33:36.248 --> 33:38.015
<i>If you anticipate,</i>
<i>you may drop it</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

33:38.017 --> 33:40.317
<i>Just a gentle squeeze.</i>
<i>Let it be a surprise.</i>

33:40.319 --> 33:42.252
<i>- </i> <i>nicely done.</i>

33:42.254 --> 33:44.187
I'm trying to make
a smiley face.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.257
- You ready to do
that quick demo?
- Bill: <i>Yes.</i>

33:47.259 --> 33:50.193
The proper way's
been demonstrated
to hold the pistol

33:50.195 --> 33:52.129
Is two hands here.

33:52.131 --> 33:55.098
We don't want you treating
it like a telephoto lens.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.267
And I'm gonna show you
why here real quick.

33:58.569 --> 34:00.504
Range is going hot.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.811
That's why you don't want
your fingers up front.

34:07.813 --> 34:11.648
Because in order
for this cylinder to turn,
there has to be a gap.

34:11.650 --> 34:14.484
Well, hot gasses,
powder, and bits of lead
come out there

34:14.486 --> 34:18.255
And it'll be damn hard
to hold a cold margarita
with this hand for two weeks.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.808
I'm gonna try to hit that
yellow bottle way back there.

34:37.810 --> 34:39.309
hit it!

34:39.311 --> 34:41.078
- Got it!
- I hit it!

34:41.080 --> 34:44.448
Yeah, you got that
on camera, right?
I'm just checking.

34:44.450 --> 34:46.683
Man:
<i>What we can do here,</i>
<i>if you'd like,</i>

34:46.685 --> 34:48.251
We can put your art up.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.220
Usually we use
pierre here.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.856
<i>If you want the art,</i>
<i>we can go ahead and put</i>
<i>the art there.</i>

34:52.858 --> 34:54.558
Yeah, let's do it.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.660
- Here we go.

34:56.662 --> 34:59.629
- All right, partner,
I think we are in business.
- All right.

35:05.436 --> 35:08.171
- Reedus:       <i>Right in her cheek.
-  </i>      <i>- her!</i>

35:12.410 --> 35:14.111
Lamagno:
<i>Holy!</i>

35:17.215 --> 35:18.648
Son of a bitch.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.750
I'll do a side thing.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.220
- See what that looks like.
You know what I mean?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

35:23.222 --> 35:24.788
Reedus:
<i>There's something</i>
<i>I really like</i>

35:24.790 --> 35:26.823
<i>About destroying something</i>
<i>you just made.</i>

35:26.825 --> 35:29.192
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>it becomes part of it.</i>

35:29.194 --> 35:31.528
- Very nice.
- Arts and crafts
with bullets.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.563
Straight out of compton,
homie.

35:33.565 --> 35:36.633
Now, did y'all want
to go ahead and shoot
these other targets, too?

35:36.635 --> 35:38.535
Yeah. Let's see how
badly I messed this guy up.

35:42.707 --> 35:46.309
I want to come back
and just spend a week here
and just blow things up.

35:46.311 --> 35:49.379
- It is a very
unusual business.
- Yeah?

35:49.381 --> 35:51.381
- <i>That's all you</i>
<i> can say about it. </i>
<i>- Yeah, absolutely.</i>

35:51.383 --> 35:53.583
Reedus:
<i>This place is straight out</i>
<i>of those old westerns.</i>

35:53.585 --> 35:54.818
- Thank you, guys, so much.
- Our pleasure.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.853
Pleasure, man.
Thank you so much, sir.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.555
- Yeah, thank you so much.
Appreciate it.
- Our pleasure.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.557
Pleasure, man.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.659
Reedus:
<i>Just looking around,</i>
<i>you can tell that these guys</i>

36:02.661 --> 36:05.362
<i>Are self-reliant texans</i>
<i>and proud of it.</i>

36:07.265 --> 36:08.932
- That was fun.
- That was great.

36:08.934 --> 36:11.501
released a little steam.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.870
Reedus:
<i>We're headed downtown</i>
<i>to drop in on colt wrangler.</i>

36:13.872 --> 36:17.474
<i>His place is</i>
<i>the hub of the san antonio</i>
<i>custom bike scene...</i>

36:19.177 --> 36:21.244
<i>And the perfect place</i>
<i>to end this trip.</i>

36:29.187 --> 36:31.555
- Wrangler:
<i>Jalapeño salt right there. </i>
<i>- Is that what that is?</i>

36:31.557 --> 36:33.523
Reedus:
<i>What's going on right here?</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

36:33.525 --> 36:36.326
- This is my mom
over here, actually.
- <i>No way!</i>

36:36.328 --> 36:37.661
Dude, your mom
is a badass.

36:37.663 --> 36:39.462
She's a
badass, dude.

36:45.269 --> 36:47.370
Reedus:
<i>Last stop.</i>

36:48.372 --> 36:49.839
<i>We're headed across town</i>
<i>to meet up with</i>

36:49.841 --> 36:52.542
<i>Young bike builder</i>
<i>colt wrangler,</i>

36:52.544 --> 36:55.812
<i>Who makes custom bikes</i>
<i>from salvaged parts.</i>

37:05.756 --> 37:07.991
Look it.
It's the downtown.

37:10.628 --> 37:13.230
- Smells like barbecue.
-  <i>Yeah, I smell that.</i>

37:13.232 --> 37:14.864
- Alamo!
- Alamo!

37:16.767 --> 37:18.468
Wow, it's so little.

37:19.770 --> 37:22.372
Tell 'em
large marge sent you.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.741
Reedus: <i>Yeah.</i>

37:28.379 --> 37:30.714
It really was
super tiny.

38:02.547 --> 38:04.781
<i>To kicking back and just</i>
<i>meeting some new friends.</i>

38:06.684 --> 38:08.918
Wow, what is this place?
What's going on?

38:08.920 --> 38:10.920
- Hi, norman.
Nice to meet you, man.
- Colt wrangler.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.422
- Nice to meet you, dude.
- It's my place.

38:12.424 --> 38:13.890
- Oh, right on.
- Glad you came, man.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.425
Reedus:
<i>Colt wrangler</i>
<i>is best known</i>

38:15.427 --> 38:17.494
<i>For his stripped-down</i>
<i>and fast bikes</i>

38:17.496 --> 38:19.629
<i>And his pride in his work</i>
<i>totally comes through.</i>

38:19.631 --> 38:22.332
- Cool spot.
- Yeah, yeah.
You want to see it?

38:22.334 --> 38:24.067
- Yeah, show me around.
- Yeah, let's check it out.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.408
Oh, you're so sweet.
Thank you.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.443
Cheers. Cheers.
Cheers. Cheers.
Cheers.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.045
<i>What's going on right here?</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

38:35.047 --> 38:37.747
<i>Jalapeño salt</i>
<i>right there.</i>

38:37.749 --> 38:40.083
- Is that what that is?
-  <i>San antonio thing.</i>

38:40.085 --> 38:42.952
Nice.
Wow, this is delicious.
Thank you.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.621
All right,
show me around.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.656
So, like,
when I got this place,

38:46.658 --> 38:48.525
It was, like, knee-high
with the weeds.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.393
Reedus: <i>Cool.</i>
<i>Why are there chickens</i>
<i>right here?</i>

38:50.395 --> 38:52.562
Well, 'cause of
chicken  bingo.

38:52.564 --> 38:54.097
Show me
chicken  bingo.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.532
You want to see
chicken  bingo?

38:57.069 --> 38:59.369
So you pick a number

38:59.371 --> 39:03.006
And you wait
for the chickens to
on the square.

39:03.008 --> 39:07.344
- That number, I guess,
is, like, the winner.
- Oh, wow.

39:07.346 --> 39:09.546
But what if the one's
constipated and it
takes forever?

39:09.548 --> 39:12.882
- Yeah, do we feed them?
- I fed them a lot of corn
and pork.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.418
- Chickens eat pork?
- They're carnivores.
Anything, man.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.753
I didn't even know that.
Wow.

39:16.755 --> 39:17.954
But if you throw, like,
five chickens on there,

39:17.956 --> 39:20.023
You get a lot of.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.691
<i>But if you do one,</i>
<i>are we doing one chicken</i>
<i>at a time?</i>

39:21.693 --> 39:24.394
We may be just sitting here
twiddling our thumbs.

39:30.634 --> 39:32.635
This is one
of my buddy's trucks.

39:32.637 --> 39:35.372
And this is where
I work on bikes.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.474
- Now, do you have partners?
- No. Just me.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.409
- It's just you?
- Dude, I was like--

39:39.411 --> 39:42.479
I've been on tuna
and saltines for, like,
several months, dude.

39:42.481 --> 39:43.880
- I've done that.
- Yeah.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.648
This is my mom
over here, actually.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.151
- She used to ride bulls.
- No way. Get out of here.

39:48.153 --> 39:51.921
She's a legend, dude.
She got on her first bull
when she was 30 years old.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.790
<i>She rode bulls</i>
<i>and bareback horses.</i>

39:53.792 --> 39:55.725
<i>Didn't know nothing about it.</i>
<i>Grew up on a farm.</i>

39:55.727 --> 39:58.161
So I grew up on
the pro rodeo circuit.

39:58.163 --> 39:59.696
So I started riding
when I was like eight.

39:59.698 --> 40:00.830
Dude, your mom
is a badass.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.832
She's a badass, dude.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.801
<i>What's the difference between</i>
<i>riding a horse and a bull?</i>

40:04.803 --> 40:07.504
Horse is a little safer
because a horse will
jump over you.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.105
Bulls, though,
they're not gonna
jump over you.

40:09.107 --> 40:10.940
They're just gonna
plow over you.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.909
Are bulls out
to  you up
from the start?

40:12.911 --> 40:14.944
No, it just depends
on the bull.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.780
You know?
But some of these ones
they have these days

40:16.782 --> 40:18.481
Are like--
they're just rowdy.

40:18.483 --> 40:20.984
Unreal. I've never met
a bull rider in my life.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.153
- No way in hell.
- Shoot, I used to pay
to get on, man.

40:23.155 --> 40:25.021
That's how crazy it was.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.689
- No way, jose.
- Yeah, there's the shop.

40:26.691 --> 40:28.525
- Wow.
- Very nice.

40:28.527 --> 40:31.795
- This is my sportster.
- This is awesome.
Yeah, show me.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.930
You know those cube lights
everybody's putting on
their trucks?

40:33.932 --> 40:36.666
- Right, right.
- So I stripped it down,
I tinted it yellow,

40:36.668 --> 40:40.503
And this screen
I actually found
in the yard.

40:40.505 --> 40:43.673
This is a stock cover
that I just chopped down.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.009
And I opened it up
and I put the screen here.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.677
That's something
out of nothing.

40:47.679 --> 40:50.513
So if you can't spend
$100-200 on an intake,

40:50.515 --> 40:52.816
Like, you can dress up
your stock parts.

40:52.818 --> 40:55.452
And that's what I've done.
You know, I can't really
afford paint.

40:55.454 --> 40:57.220
And I really started really
liking the raw metal,

40:57.222 --> 41:00.223
- So I just
stripped it all down.
- I like the whole design of it.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.559
I get a lot of parts,
like, wrecks and stuff.

41:02.561 --> 41:05.562
And a lot of the shops
will throw their stuff
out by the dumpsters

41:05.564 --> 41:07.497
<i>And you can just go</i>
<i>there and get stuff.</i>

41:07.499 --> 41:10.133
<i>Reuse, like,</i>
<i>wrecked fenders,</i>
<i>wrecked tanks.</i>

41:10.135 --> 41:12.735
They make awesome,
like, cafe seat cowls.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.838
Reedus:
<i>Dude, you're super</i>
<i>fascinating.</i>

41:14.840 --> 41:17.240
I'll be glad
when fascinating turns
into steak dinners

41:17.242 --> 41:19.242
Instead of tuna,
so I'm getting there, man.

41:19.244 --> 41:23.046
If you
really want something,
your actions will follow.

41:23.048 --> 41:25.715
You know?
Then you just do
and you do and you do

41:25.717 --> 41:28.084
And the next thing you know,
you end up with something
that you really like.

41:28.086 --> 41:29.986
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know?

41:29.988 --> 41:32.489
- It sort of has been
the theme of texas.
- Yeah.

41:32.491 --> 41:35.258
- Absolutely.
- Individuals become
their own bosses

41:35.260 --> 41:37.794
And do it their way
and think outside the box.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.729
- You can here. It's great.
- It's super interesting.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.598
We got room to grow.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.667
- One, two, three.
-        Chicken!

41:44.669 --> 41:46.903
Reedus:
<i>Colt is just starting out,</i>

41:46.905 --> 41:49.138
<i>But he's already proving</i>
<i>that he's doing it</i>
<i>the right way,</i>

41:49.140 --> 41:52.742
<i>Using his surroundings</i>
<i>to do what he wants</i>
<i>the way he wants.</i>

41:52.744 --> 41:54.811
<i>He's pulling himself</i>
<i>up by his bootstraps</i>

41:54.813 --> 41:56.713
<i>And creating something</i>
<i>unique and memorable.</i>

41:58.749 --> 42:00.750
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>You got to wonder</i>

42:00.752 --> 42:02.919
<i>If he'd be able to do this</i>
<i>anywhere else.</i>

42:02.921 --> 42:05.154
Look at mine.
It's, like, all weird.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.725
I got me a girl.
Yee-haw!

42:14.932 --> 42:18.067
- That was fun, huh?
- That was killer.

42:18.069 --> 42:20.670
- Thank you, norman.
- Yeah, buddy.

42:20.672 --> 42:22.839
Reedus:
<i>The texas I found</i>
<i>on this ride</i>

42:22.841 --> 42:25.074
<i>Really is the one</i>
<i>I always dreamed of.</i>

42:25.076 --> 42:29.612
<i>A breeding ground</i>
<i>of rebels and artists.</i>

42:29.614 --> 42:32.315
<i>There's an energy</i>
<i>and vitality here in texas</i>

42:32.317 --> 42:34.751
<i>That's unlike</i>
<i>anything else.</i>

42:34.753 --> 42:37.554
<i>From the creative hubs</i>
<i>of austin and san antonio</i>

42:37.556 --> 42:40.590
<i>To the back roads</i>
<i>of the hill country,</i>

42:40.592 --> 42:42.992
<i>This is one of those</i>
<i>places in america</i>

42:42.994 --> 42:45.061
<i>That gives people</i>
<i>the freedom to be</i>

42:45.063 --> 42:46.963
<i>Whoever they want to be.</i>

42:49.333 --> 42:51.668
Texas is beautiful.

42:51.670 --> 42:54.304
- Reedus:
It's much better on a bike.
- Absolutely.
