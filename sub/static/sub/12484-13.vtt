00:10.590 --> 00:12.600
Hey, students.
Beautiful day, huh?

00:12.630 --> 00:15.230
Everybody psyched about
the field trip next week?

00:15.270 --> 00:16.570
The Presidio!

00:17.540 --> 00:19.340
Interesting factoid.

00:22.540 --> 00:25.480
The Presidio was fortified in 1776

00:25.510 --> 00:28.650
when the Spanish made it the
military center of their expansion.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.619
Dude, don't try to make our
field trip all educational.

00:32.650 --> 00:34.750
Now I'm going to collect
your permission slips.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.330
I think I left my permission slip at home.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.270
I remember it was in my hand

00:44.300 --> 00:46.330
when I went to get some
orange juice this morning.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.710
Well, at least I know it's in the fridge.

00:55.710 --> 00:58.650
Hey, It's Mr. McMillan.
No biggie.

01:00.480 --> 01:02.620
Uh, sorry,
Mr. McMillan,

01:02.650 --> 01:05.349
but I forgot my permission slip.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.260
You forgot it?

01:08.690 --> 01:10.520
You forgot it?

01:12.290 --> 01:13.690
I guess what I do here isn't important!

01:13.730 --> 01:15.660
"No biggie, Mr. McMillan."

01:15.700 --> 01:17.530
That's what you kids always say.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.570
Well, guess what!
It is a biggie!

01:19.600 --> 01:21.570
Actually, it's bigger than a biggie.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.370
It's a hugie!

01:25.400 --> 01:27.440
I can bring it in tomorrow.

01:28.470 --> 01:31.240
Oh, sure, tomorrow.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.540
That's what my girlfriend said, too.

01:32.580 --> 01:33.710
"I'll be back tomorrow...

01:33.740 --> 01:36.310
"To pack up my things!"

01:37.680 --> 01:40.350
Last I hear, she's married to some clown.

01:40.390 --> 01:42.290
And I mean an actual clown!

01:43.760 --> 01:47.430
Just because he has a car!

01:47.460 --> 01:50.530
For what it's worth, I'm sure
it's one of those tiny cars.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.270
Okay. Why don't I go get
my permission slip?

01:56.300 --> 01:57.600
Maybe that will make you feel better.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.410
Here's what will make me feel better.

01:59.440 --> 02:02.440
Never seeing any of you irresponsible,

02:02.480 --> 02:05.680
ungrateful little twerps ever again!

02:07.520 --> 02:09.680
Wait, no! Don't jump!

02:12.350 --> 02:13.590
Ow!

02:13.620 --> 02:16.460
Who puts rose bushes outside a window?

02:16.490 --> 02:18.560
Oh, great, now I tore my pants.

02:18.590 --> 02:19.590
Come on!

02:27.500 --> 02:28.670
So...

02:29.710 --> 02:31.270
Who wants some juice?

02:31.470 --> 02:32.670

03:28.630 --> 03:30.330
Hey, Dad.

03:30.370 --> 03:31.630
I have to write a thousand word paper

03:31.670 --> 03:33.500
about a neighborhood hero.

03:33.540 --> 03:37.410
Well, I am a highly
decorated police officer.

03:39.410 --> 03:40.580
Of course!

03:40.610 --> 03:42.640
Why didn't I think of that?

03:42.680 --> 03:45.450
Do you know touch with Batman?

03:47.350 --> 03:49.580
Because he's not responding to this.

03:52.390 --> 03:54.460
Cameron, that's ridiculous.

03:54.490 --> 03:57.760
Batman lives not San Francisco.

03:59.460 --> 04:01.600
If you need a hero, what about me?

04:02.600 --> 04:03.670
What's heroic about you?

04:06.240 --> 04:07.340
Are you kidding me?

04:07.370 --> 04:08.640
What do you think I do all day?

04:08.670 --> 04:09.670
Yell at us.

04:09.710 --> 04:11.670
Complain about how much stuff costs.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.570
Scratch your...

04:13.610 --> 04:14.670
Self.

04:16.680 --> 04:20.380
Hey, I'm out there
crime every day.ighting.

04:20.410 --> 04:21.610
Come with me on
a few ride-alongs.

04:21.649 --> 04:24.250
You'll get your thousand words.

04:24.290 --> 04:27.450
Okay, but I'll probably slip from school.

04:27.490 --> 04:29.620
No problem.
Just use this one.

04:34.630 --> 04:36.260
Way to go, Chyna.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.300
You got rid of our coolest teacher.

04:38.330 --> 04:41.440
Look, guys, all I did was
forget my permission slip.

04:41.470 --> 04:44.500
I mean, no reasonable person
would ever blame me for this.

04:44.540 --> 04:47.470
Chyna, this is all your fault!

04:47.510 --> 04:49.710
You have crushed the spirits
of one of my teachers.

04:49.740 --> 04:52.350
That's my job!

04:52.380 --> 04:55.480
I don't know where I'm going
to find a substitute.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.620
Please don't
get Mr. Gregory.

04:57.650 --> 05:00.450
He dyes his nose hair to look younger.

05:00.490 --> 05:03.290
I wish I could hire that loser,

05:03.320 --> 05:05.560
but it would be awkward,
given our romantic past.

05:07.290 --> 05:09.630
Look, it can't be that hard
to find another teacher.

05:09.660 --> 05:11.400
I mean, Olive's 11

05:11.430 --> 05:13.570
and she knows everything there
is to know about history.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.670
Good idea.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.600
Olive will be the new history teacher.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.670
What?

05:18.710 --> 05:20.510
Principal Skidmore, I wasn't suggesting...

05:20.540 --> 05:23.580
No, it's perfect!
The little brainiac will save me money.

05:23.610 --> 05:28.250
Plus I can skip all those
state-mandated background checks.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.290
You haven't committed
any violent crimes, have you?

05:30.320 --> 05:31.350
No.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.240
Not yet.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.530
I can't do this!
I can't teach here!

05:42.570 --> 05:44.730
I don't even want to be a student here!

05:44.770 --> 05:46.600
You can, and you will.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.800
And don't worry.
You'll have my full support.

05:48.840 --> 05:52.740
If you have any problems at
all, just call my panic line.

05:54.410 --> 05:56.610
This says "Hair
Removal Club Card."

05:56.650 --> 06:00.680
Oh, you're only two stamps
away from a free back waxing!

06:00.720 --> 06:02.450
Give me that.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.590
Calm down, Olive.
You're going to hyperventilate.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.730
Too late!

06:11.760 --> 06:13.760
Fletcher, give me
your shoe! Stat!

06:20.600 --> 06:22.710
Ew! Don't ever
do that again.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.440
You could have slipped into a coma.

06:24.470 --> 06:25.640
Well, next time, let me!

06:27.410 --> 06:29.480
Olive, I'm sure it's only for a few days.

06:29.510 --> 06:31.510
You always say history is fun.

06:31.550 --> 06:34.380
Well, not Euclidean geometry fun,

06:34.420 --> 06:35.520
but a close second.

06:35.550 --> 06:36.750
So make it fun!

06:37.820 --> 06:39.660
I guess I could try that.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.420
Just don't ever make me smell
Fletcher's shoe again.

06:42.460 --> 06:45.530
Come on, my shoes don't smell that bad.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.740
Don't worry.
I'll revive him.

06:54.670 --> 06:56.410
Whoa!

06:57.840 --> 06:59.540
Interesting.

07:08.650 --> 07:11.690
That crow is never gonna be
able to pick up that shoe.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.490
Dad, this is boring.

07:14.530 --> 07:16.460
We're staking out a bird.

07:16.490 --> 07:21.400
Cameron, police work is 99%
waiting, 1% pure adrenaline.

07:24.640 --> 07:27.740
It would have been so cool if
something happened just then.

07:27.770 --> 07:29.570
Nothing ever happens.

07:29.610 --> 07:30.680
We've been...

07:30.710 --> 07:31.810
<i>Attention, all units.</i>

07:31.840 --> 07:34.680
<i>We have a 139,</i>
<i>repeat, we have a 139</i>

07:34.710 --> 07:37.480
<i>at the corner of State</i>
<i>and Van Ness.</i>

07:37.520 --> 07:40.690
Unit 51 responding.
We're on our way.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.390
A 139? Cool!
What's that?

07:43.420 --> 07:44.820
Breaking and entering?
A shoot out?

07:44.860 --> 07:46.460
Better!

07:46.490 --> 07:49.590
Pedro's is having a lunch
special, burritos for $1.39!

07:49.630 --> 07:51.800
Buckle up.
This is what we train for.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.600
Hello, students.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.410
You are getting a new history teacher.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.510
I expect that you treat
her with the same respect

08:06.550 --> 08:08.550
you gave the last teacher.

08:08.580 --> 08:11.450
Minus the causing him to jump out a window.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.690
And don't worry.
You're going to love our new teacher.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.450
She's awesome!

08:15.490 --> 08:18.460
I thought it was going to be Olive.

08:18.490 --> 08:20.590
Trust me, this new teacher totally rules.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.730
Good day, my royal subjects.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.830
Good luck.

08:33.539 --> 08:35.409
What are you doing?

08:35.440 --> 08:37.809
I'm doing what you told me.
Making history fun.

08:37.840 --> 08:41.610
Class, do you know who I am?

08:41.650 --> 08:44.750
Wow, Olive.
Your outfits are usually out of date,

08:44.790 --> 08:46.420
but never this much.

08:47.490 --> 08:50.360
I am Queen Elizabeth I.

08:50.390 --> 08:53.730
I ruled England from 1558 to 1603.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.400
Good times.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.730
Olive?

08:59.770 --> 09:01.640
I know this may be fun for you,

09:01.670 --> 09:02.670
but everyone else?

09:02.700 --> 09:04.770
Yeah, not so much.

09:04.810 --> 09:07.780
Well, not yet.
We haven't gotten to the good part.

09:07.810 --> 09:10.710
We'll be reenacting the signing
of the Treaty of Commerce.

09:10.750 --> 09:14.550
You'll be William Harborne, the first
ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.

09:16.580 --> 09:18.480
Here's your mustache.

09:21.350 --> 09:23.420
Olive, I'm not going to wear this.

09:26.490 --> 09:28.690
What did you stick this on with?

09:28.730 --> 09:30.600
Mega Glue!
From Glueco!

09:30.630 --> 09:34.630
"A space-age polymer creating a
permanent bond to any surface!

09:34.670 --> 09:37.400
"Warning.
Do not apply to human..."

09:37.440 --> 09:39.670
You know, I really don't remember.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.510
I'll get you for this.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.710
I don't know how, yet, but I can
twirl this while I think about it.

09:47.480 --> 09:51.680
Trust me, no British Queen was
more beloved and respected than I!

09:56.760 --> 09:58.660
Help! Help!

09:58.690 --> 10:01.560
You have reached Principal
Skidmore's panic line.

10:02.460 --> 10:03.700
We are currently closed.

10:03.730 --> 10:05.830
What?

10:05.870 --> 10:10.540
To leave a message for one of our
emergency responders, press one.

10:12.610 --> 10:14.710
That mailbox is currently full.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.780
Goodbye.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.420
Spitballs!

10:21.450 --> 10:23.620
I mean, how cliche is that?

10:26.590 --> 10:29.460
Classics never go away.
It's old-school.

10:33.630 --> 10:36.700
I've been hit!
Friendly fire!

10:38.800 --> 10:41.670
Great idea, Chyna.
"Be fun."

10:42.470 --> 10:44.470
Okay, new plan.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.640
If you're going to be a teacher,
you need to take charge.

10:49.550 --> 10:50.580
Be a leader.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.720
Command respect.

10:55.690 --> 10:57.620
Oh, I get it.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.860
So, you're saying instead of
dressing up as Elizabeth I,

10:59.890 --> 11:02.630
I should dress up as Edward II,

11:02.660 --> 11:06.500
the brutal and somewhat
catty 14th century monarch?

11:06.530 --> 11:09.470
No, I'm pretty much saying
no costumes at all.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.830
You gotta be tough.

11:16.470 --> 11:18.670
The things we women do to look good.

11:22.810 --> 11:24.680
So, have you finished your paper yet?

11:24.710 --> 11:26.450
Finished it?

11:26.480 --> 11:27.680
You've given me nothing.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.390
All I've done so far is watch you eat.

11:30.420 --> 11:33.520
The only arrest I have a chance
of seeing is cardiac arrest.

11:34.690 --> 11:35.820
Maybe not.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.730
See that guy over there?

11:37.760 --> 11:39.760
He's a suspicious character.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.660
I feel it in my gut.

11:41.700 --> 11:45.500
What you feel in your gut
is your ninth burrito.

11:45.540 --> 11:47.870
I'm telling you, I don't
trust that guy over there

11:47.900 --> 11:49.670
hanging out by the ice cream parlor.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.880
Don't touch my burrito.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.680
Ow, watch my sprinkles!

12:01.480 --> 12:04.590
Keep your mouth shut and put
your hands behind your cone.

12:04.620 --> 12:07.360
Dad, he's not a suspicious character.

12:07.390 --> 12:10.460
He's a delicious character.

12:10.490 --> 12:12.460
Yeah, I was just passing out coupons.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.730
What kind of coupons?

12:14.760 --> 12:16.560
Buy one, get one free.

12:18.830 --> 12:22.500
I'm going to have to confiscate
those coupons as evidence.

12:22.540 --> 12:25.610
Attention, all units,
I got a 2-4-1.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.840
I repeat, a 2-4-1.

12:32.650 --> 12:33.810
Take your seats!

12:35.550 --> 12:36.820
We got a lot of ground to cover!

12:39.590 --> 12:43.420
Let's go, let's go.
This isn't the march to Macedonia, people.

12:45.630 --> 12:49.530
Which, for you ignoramuses,
was a very slow march.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.600
You think this is funny?

12:56.640 --> 12:58.440
You know what funny starts with?

12:58.470 --> 13:00.410
"F"!

13:00.440 --> 13:03.680
I knew that one.
You just didn't give me time to answer.

13:10.750 --> 13:14.660
Sorry I'm late.
I was at the... Library.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.600
That is unacceptable.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.530
You just earned yourself detention.

13:20.570 --> 13:22.530
But after school I have a hair appointment.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.740
Also at the library.

13:28.540 --> 13:29.640
No talking!

13:32.610 --> 13:35.380
Wow, you're really taking control.

13:35.410 --> 13:36.580
Good job.

13:36.610 --> 13:37.710
I said no talking!

13:39.580 --> 13:40.820
But Olive, I was just...

13:40.850 --> 13:43.650
Nobody cares about what you were doing.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.560
And my name is Miss Doyle, young lady.

13:49.430 --> 13:50.730
"Young lady"?

13:50.760 --> 13:53.830
I'm four months older than you.

13:53.860 --> 13:56.760
That does it.
You have detention, too!

13:56.800 --> 13:59.670
No. Forget it!
I didn't even do anything wrong.

13:59.700 --> 14:03.600
Miss Parks, you do not
want to push me, or...

14:03.640 --> 14:04.810
Or what?

14:08.580 --> 14:11.710
Thank you for coming in to discuss
your daughter's behavioral issues.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.620
I'm ashamed of you, Chyna.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.820
And pulling me away from work?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.790
I had a 2-4-1

15:05.560 --> 15:07.630
We've been here a whole five minutes.

15:09.470 --> 15:13.440
I think. Is it day?
Is it night?

15:13.470 --> 15:16.370
It's 4:00 in the afternoon.
I just sang it in my song.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.610
Did I hear music?

15:23.280 --> 15:25.250
I said no jailhouse ditties!

15:27.390 --> 15:28.590
Olive...

15:33.260 --> 15:34.360
Ms. Doyle.

15:37.430 --> 15:40.200
Are you really going to make
us sit here all afternoon

15:40.230 --> 15:41.270
and do nothing?

15:41.300 --> 15:42.600
Of course not.

15:42.630 --> 15:45.600
You're going to scrape the
gum from under the desks.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.370
Oh, please.
Nobody sticks gum under...

15:48.410 --> 15:50.670
Ew, one of these has a tooth in it!

15:54.350 --> 15:55.580
Deal with it.

15:55.610 --> 15:57.580
If you guys are going to
act like wild animals,

15:57.620 --> 16:00.290
you're going to be locked up
in a cage like wild animals.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.450
If we're wild animals,

16:01.490 --> 16:03.420
shouldn't we be out in the wild?

16:05.230 --> 16:08.230
Okay, you'll be locked up
in a cage like zoo animals.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.460
Actually, most modern
zoos have abandoned cages

16:10.500 --> 16:12.570
in favor of
open-air habitats.

16:12.600 --> 16:16.640
Fine, you'll be locked up in a cage like
animals in a really bad regional circus.

16:16.670 --> 16:18.510
Speaking of which, I went the other night

16:18.540 --> 16:20.440
and it is a bad circus.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.610
I mean, the dancing bear
couldn't even do an arabesque.

16:22.640 --> 16:25.350
It's not that hard. All you have to
do is put your leg up like this.

16:25.380 --> 16:27.180
I know!

16:27.220 --> 16:28.620
No circus dancing in detention!

16:38.260 --> 16:40.260
Olive is completely out of control.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.330
I know, right?

16:41.360 --> 16:43.460
She has to be stopped.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.430
Wow, for the first time ever,

16:45.470 --> 16:48.200
you and I actually have
something in common.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.440
We do.
Yeah.

16:49.470 --> 16:52.270
Ugh, this day just keeps getting worse!

16:57.380 --> 16:58.650
Look, we need to figure out a way

16:58.680 --> 17:00.550
to put an end to Olive's teaching career.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.490
I've got it!

17:03.520 --> 17:07.520
We'll replace her conditioner
with an off-brand version.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.359
Her hair will be so flat and lifeless,

17:10.390 --> 17:12.630
she'll never want to come to school again.

17:17.329 --> 17:20.300
Okay, let's put that in our back pocket

17:22.410 --> 17:23.670
and keep thinking. Okay?

17:27.579 --> 17:29.180
I don't get it.

17:29.210 --> 17:31.250
How do you call Batman during the day?

17:34.480 --> 17:37.190
Ooh, you got ice cream!

17:37.220 --> 17:38.390
You're eating both?

17:39.320 --> 17:41.220
What about me?

17:41.260 --> 17:44.390
You saw the coupon.
It's two for one.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.300
Okay, I'm out of here.

17:47.330 --> 17:49.200
I'm doing my paper on Mom.

17:49.230 --> 17:50.430
At least she feeds me.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.570
I am so, so sorry.

17:56.610 --> 18:01.240
Here, sir, you dropped your bag
of loose diamonds and watches.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.480
Enjoy your ski trip!

18:06.550 --> 18:08.650
Cameron, this guy is obviously a burglar!

18:11.450 --> 18:12.490
Ice cream cone!

18:12.520 --> 18:14.590
I knew this guy was up to no good.

18:16.630 --> 18:19.330
Dispatch, this is Unit 51.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.630
I caught a bad guy!

18:22.430 --> 18:24.500
Wow.
My dad is a hero!

18:24.530 --> 18:26.500
"Wow. My dad is a hero."

18:26.540 --> 18:29.600
That's only six words.
I need a thousand!

18:29.640 --> 18:32.170
A picture's worth a thousand words.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.470
Good idea, Dad.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.440
Okay.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.310
Say, "Nothing
without your lawyer."

18:39.350 --> 18:41.210
Nothing without your lawyer.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.520
Can you text me that picture?

18:49.590 --> 18:51.520
Fletcher, don't go in there!

18:51.560 --> 18:53.490
The classroom is rigged to make sure

18:53.530 --> 18:55.700
Olive will never want
to be a teacher again.

18:56.530 --> 18:57.660
What did you do?

18:57.700 --> 18:59.630
Olive said we were caged animals,

18:59.670 --> 19:02.470
so we're going to turn
her into a caged animal.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.610
I put glue in the lock so she
won't be able to get out.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.210
That's not the prank.

19:07.240 --> 19:10.310
She said we were wild animals,

19:10.350 --> 19:13.310
so we're going to show her what
a real wild animal is like.

19:17.520 --> 19:21.220
Miss Doyle is running late,
so I'm filling in.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.590
Take your seats.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.360
Quit your grumbling.
We've got work to do.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.430
Oh, Momma...

19:37.240 --> 19:38.270
Huh.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.380
It didn't do that trick in the circus.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.410
You put a bear in the classroom?

19:44.450 --> 19:46.280
You put glue in the locks!

19:48.450 --> 19:50.290
You know, maybe, in the future,

19:50.320 --> 19:51.590
we should coordinate our pranks.

20:07.570 --> 20:09.600
I can't believe Principal
Skidmore fought with a bear

20:09.640 --> 20:11.710
and walked away with only a few scratches.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.340
Yeah, but I hear that bear

20:15.380 --> 20:17.640
is going to be in physical
therapy for six months.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.650
Great. So now we're stuck
with Miss Doyle?

20:21.680 --> 20:23.520
Not necessarily.

20:23.550 --> 20:26.420
I think I have a new way
to get rid of Miss Doyle.

20:28.720 --> 20:32.360
All right, everybody, eyes
forward, mouths shut!

20:35.300 --> 20:36.560
Tomorrow is our field trip,

20:36.600 --> 20:39.470
so I'm going to need all the
outstanding permission slips.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.640
Uh, Miss Doyle, I forgot mine again.

20:45.270 --> 20:46.710
You forgot it?

20:46.740 --> 20:48.440
You forgot it?

20:48.470 --> 20:50.710
As if my job isn't hard enough already.

20:50.740 --> 20:52.480
The system is broken!

20:52.510 --> 20:54.550
Classes are overcrowded,
there's no resources,

20:54.580 --> 20:59.550
and the coffee in the teachers'
lounge is undrinkable.

20:59.590 --> 21:03.290
Not because it tastes bad, but because
my mommy won't let me have any.

21:04.590 --> 21:06.560
Well, then why don't you just quit?

21:06.600 --> 21:08.530
I want my friend Olive back.

21:08.570 --> 21:11.470
Who's with me?
Who wants Olive back?

21:15.370 --> 21:17.270
Okay, let me rephrase.

21:17.310 --> 21:20.280
Who never wants to see
Miss Doyle ever again?

21:24.350 --> 21:26.480
See, Olive?
They love you.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.390
They do love me, don't they?

21:30.420 --> 21:32.290
Okay, I quit.

21:34.730 --> 21:37.390
So, you want to do something
after school today?

21:37.430 --> 21:38.560
After school?

21:38.600 --> 21:40.730
Sorry, I have somewhere I have to be.
