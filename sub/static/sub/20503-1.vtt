01:24.383 --> 01:26.384
What?

01:33.025 --> 01:36.027
- Dad?
- Dad!

01:57.184 --> 02:01.686
All right, you're all
mic'd up there and ready to go.

02:01.688 --> 02:04.789
I can't believe I'm getting
your voicemail again.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.859
This is it, Scottie. Dad only
has a few weeks left.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.829
When are you flying in?
Just call me back.

02:10.830 --> 02:14.533
All right cliff, magic time!

02:25.479 --> 02:28.680
If I was smart, I'd fire him.
Really?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.081
Yeah.

02:30.083 --> 02:34.185
- Hey Joe.
- Good luck!

02:34.187 --> 02:35.921
Can we get last looks?

02:35.923 --> 02:41.927
Good to see
you again. Quiet please!

02:41.929 --> 02:44.496
All right,
let's, uh, talk about Kelly.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.898
You saw her
tape, right? She saw yours.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.967
I gotta be honest, you know,

02:48.969 --> 02:53.672
I can already sense this chemistry
between the two of you. Do you?

02:53.674 --> 02:57.876
Uh well, sh-she's beautiful.
What, what else is there to say?

02:57.878 --> 03:01.479
I mean she's, she's an
all-American girl.

03:01.481 --> 03:04.249
Oh come on, Scottie, give me more.
What did you think?

03:04.251 --> 03:08.720
Did you think she was marriage material?
Princess material?

03:08.722 --> 03:16.722
- Oh, uh, y-you want me to sell it?
Scottie, I just want you.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.899
There's no doubt about it.
Kelly is that girl next door,

03:20.901 --> 03:24.569
who gives you that kind of look that makes
you want to come down from your horse.

03:24.571 --> 03:28.006
Kelly's my dream girl,
but she's more than a dream.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.808
It's really kind of exciting
when you see her.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.676
She's like one of the
guys, you know?

03:31.678 --> 03:35.747
This season of young bucks
comes to an end Monday night.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.215
She is a knockout!

03:37.217 --> 03:39.818
Even darkness is not dark to
Kelly.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.720
She's blonde. I'm blond.

03:41.722 --> 03:45.423
I've always kind of liked those
brother sister couples a little bit.

03:45.425 --> 03:48.526
This weekend, relive the
magic of the last six weeks

03:48.528 --> 03:49.894
with your favorite young buck
episodes.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.930
I'm a hugger. A really
big hugger.

03:51.932 --> 03:56.468
She's an all-American hugger
fairy Princess.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.437
Will this hugger fairy
Princess find her true love?

03:59.439 --> 04:02.374
Or, will her heart be broken?

04:02.376 --> 04:06.645
I know my heart. It's so
confused.

04:06.647 --> 04:12.283
I feel like a little girl trapped
in some Grimm fairytale.

04:12.285 --> 04:16.588
This is awful.

04:16.589 --> 04:21.526
It's all Monday night on the
shocking finale of young bucks!

04:21.528 --> 04:24.562
Mount up, America!

04:32.538 --> 04:39.444
- 'Scuse me, y'all got ESPN or something?
- Sure.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.814
Anything for a young buck.

04:42.816 --> 04:50.816
We don't get too many of those
around here.

05:13.179 --> 05:16.181
God dammit, foster!

05:16.183 --> 05:22.620
You stir shit up
wherever you go, Mr. reality?

05:22.622 --> 05:28.159
So how long ago did you finish shooting
that show? You look different.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.929
Uh, a few weeks ago, I guess.

05:30.931 --> 05:36.234
No way! Shit, so did you get
the girl?

05:36.236 --> 05:40.638
What'd you call her? The
all-American hugger fairy Princess?

05:40.640 --> 05:44.843
- I never actually said that.
- You said it tonight.

05:48.948 --> 05:53.184
You said it. I heard you.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.653
You heard me say it tonight,
but I never actually said it.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.655
Yeah you did.

05:57.657 --> 06:00.925
The producers do this thing where
they "Frankenbite" dialogue.

06:00.927 --> 06:04.662
They edit together two totally different
conversations to make their own dialogue.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.264
It's, I don't know.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.567
If the camera's not on me when I'm
talking, you can bet the dialogue...

06:09.569 --> 06:11.136
Has been Frankensteined.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.605
You got it.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.640
Reality can be such a bitch.

06:19.044 --> 06:21.679
You know what the
magazines say about you?

06:21.681 --> 06:24.482
They say that you're just
a waiter.

06:24.484 --> 06:28.620
Is this true, or you
keepin' something from America?

06:28.622 --> 06:36.060
Are you like secretly a prince
undercover, or you just got some demons?

06:36.062 --> 06:40.665
I mean what would honestly possess
you to be on a show like that?

06:40.667 --> 06:42.400
It's so degrading!

06:42.402 --> 06:49.974
- It's like the lowest common
denominator of humanity. Okay!

06:49.976 --> 06:57.048
I mean most people think that
reality stars are douchebags.

06:57.050 --> 07:02.821
Wow.

07:02.823 --> 07:10.823
Oh yeah! Fuck me, oh you, you
young fucking buck. Scottie!

07:31.785 --> 07:33.885
It's
Scottie. You know what to do.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.588
Hey Scottie, it's me again.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.790
Um, I thought you were coming
this morning with the truck.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.025
You said you were coming.

07:41.027 --> 07:45.129
Fitz is here. I'm here. We've
got that meeting on Monday.

07:45.131 --> 07:49.367
Fuck. Just call me back.
Ah, shit!

08:33.078 --> 08:35.013
Oh!

08:35.015 --> 08:36.847
Well, timing is everything, huh?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.650
I was gonna surprise you
with this later.

08:38.652 --> 08:42.754
- They do this in Hawaii.
- We're not in Hawaii.

08:42.756 --> 08:48.793
I know. I found all this stuff: Candles,
Bambi over there, in your dad's shed.

08:48.795 --> 08:55.500
- So, got a wee bit distracted today.
- Kate:

08:55.502 --> 08:57.335
Kate, the yardwork will get
done. I promise.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.637
I know, but you just said you
were gonna do it today.

08:59.639 --> 09:02.273
- We have so much to do.
- It's gonna get done, okay?

09:02.275 --> 09:06.611
Don't worry. It's not like the
sale's gonna fall through.

09:06.613 --> 09:10.615
Kate! What's wrong? He didn't
call?

09:10.617 --> 09:15.853
No. God, I just want to throttle the
little shit and that slippery smile.

09:15.855 --> 09:20.658
Katie, come on. I told you, don't worry.
I can always get us another truck.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.661
Calm down.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.662
I'm not gonna calm down! Jesus
Fitz, just let me be pissed at him!

09:24.664 --> 09:26.931
Okay. Well, you can throw your
piss around all you want,

09:26.933 --> 09:30.468
but he's never gonna be who you
want him to be.

09:30.470 --> 09:33.938
I just need him to show up.

09:33.940 --> 09:40.144
- Throw my piss around?
- Yeah, don't do that. It's gross.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.946
I don't know.

09:41.948 --> 09:44.315
- Such a weirdo.
- Well, picture it!

09:44.317 --> 09:48.286
I know this is all a little much,
but just entertain me, okay?

09:48.288 --> 09:50.655
Speak to the universe;
The milky way.

09:50.657 --> 09:55.393
It'll make you feel better, and I'll
clean it all up in the morning.

09:55.395 --> 09:59.964
- Do it for Bambi!
- Okay?

09:59.966 --> 10:06.204
Um, I've got a cabin full of
Randy Olson's stuff,

10:06.206 --> 10:10.408
and a brother who's a smiling
shithead, and

10:12.411 --> 10:16.848
guess I'm just looking
for some help.

10:31.764 --> 10:34.399
Good luck.

10:39.204 --> 10:42.874
I grew up close to the woods, so
my dad would take me hunting,

10:42.876 --> 10:46.044
but whatever, you know, I
killed, I had to eat it.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.912
First thing I ate was a
squirrel.

10:47.914 --> 10:50.815
It was pretty gross, but kinda
tastes like chicken.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.216
Pull!

10:52.218 --> 10:54.419
That's what you say when you're
shooting Clay pigeons,

10:54.421 --> 10:57.055
not bales of hay!

10:57.057 --> 11:01.726
Pretty good, pretty good.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.694
Aww!

11:03.696 --> 11:06.631
- That...
- that was terrible!

11:06.633 --> 11:08.332
Where were you aiming?

11:08.334 --> 11:09.901
For your heart.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.136
Oh, very sweet.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.539
But, you still missed.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.407
Well, you know there's something
really special about Scottie.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.943
There's definitely something going
on in those blue eyes of his.

11:18.945 --> 11:23.181
There's something spinning, or
troubling, or just plain sexy.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.616
He's a good hugger. And I'm
hugger. A really big hugger.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.785
Looking forward to hugging him
again!

11:32.092 --> 11:36.461
So, I know that you are a really
bad shot, but that's about it.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.930
What else do you want to know?

11:38.932 --> 11:42.233
You could tell me about your family.
You have a sister, right?

11:42.235 --> 11:47.271
Yeah, yeah. I have an older sister.
She's a consultant for big companies.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.674
Tells them how to do their jobs.

11:53.812 --> 11:55.213
What?

11:55.215 --> 11:58.382
You've got to give me, like, a
little bit more.

12:00.385 --> 12:03.146
It could be harmless. It could be
like your favorite childhood memory.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.593
You wanna keep the buckle,
don't you?

12:13.165 --> 12:16.467
There was this cabin on a lake.

12:16.469 --> 12:21.973
It wasn't much of a place,
but, um,

12:21.975 --> 12:28.079
but in the summer, my-my sister
and I would swim for hours.

12:28.081 --> 12:32.383
We'd take these long, running
jumps off the dock.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.784
Hundreds in a day.

12:36.688 --> 12:38.089
I don't know.

12:39.491 --> 12:42.827
Freed us from the grief of
living with Randy and Sandy.

12:42.829 --> 12:47.131
- Randy and Sandy?
- My parents. I know.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.680
Oh, and then my sister,
she names the dog Brandy.

12:49.705 --> 12:50.801
That's hilarious.

12:50.803 --> 12:53.271
Not really.
It's sad.

12:55.274 --> 12:59.076
Are your parents still together?

12:59.078 --> 13:03.214
No. My mom died when I was
in junior high,

13:03.216 --> 13:06.417
but uh my dad took over, and

13:06.419 --> 13:09.654
he wasn't really cut out to be
a single parent.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.567
I think we just had it.

13:25.837 --> 13:29.674
I think we just had
a real moment.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.075
Yeah.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.347
Here.

13:37.916 --> 13:42.887
Keep this, and it'll remind you
of our real moment.

13:50.429 --> 13:53.864
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

13:53.866 --> 13:55.566
Oh, you're going down.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.268
- Come on Kelly!
- Ow.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.371
- No, oh, oh, one, two, three,
pin! -

14:00.373 --> 14:03.474
I came on this show because I
have lost at love.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.875
I want to have my happy ending.

14:04.877 --> 14:08.379
The Scottie ending could be the
happiest ending on earth.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.414
I mean I know there's a lot of
other guys,

14:10.416 --> 14:12.516
and I have to get to know them,

14:12.518 --> 14:14.652
but Scottie could be the
one for me.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.454
Look at me! I'm ridiculous!

14:16.456 --> 14:19.257
She's not what I expected.

14:19.259 --> 14:22.059
She was lovely.

15:36.435 --> 15:40.604
You can't take it with you if
they take it outta you.

15:40.606 --> 15:45.676
- They're his, huh?
- Yep.

15:45.678 --> 15:49.680
So good to see you,
even if you're 15 hours late.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.649
I got caught up with
post show stuff.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.685
Just give me a hug
before I rip your head off!

15:58.690 --> 16:03.027
Ou know, they say a baby boomer
dies every 39 seconds.

16:03.029 --> 16:09.867
Did they all leave
so much shit behind?

16:09.869 --> 16:11.902
I like the labeling thing.

16:11.904 --> 16:15.506
Oh, shh, is your dude here?
Fritzy?

16:15.508 --> 16:18.776
- Fitz. Yeah, he's s-sleeping.
- Fitz.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.478
I gave you the front room.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.947
It's kind of a mess, but I
thought you should have it.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.416
You didn't have to do that.

16:25.418 --> 16:29.553
Oh no, I know. Um, come here.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.589
I want to show you something.

16:45.003 --> 16:48.005
Look, that ridiculous Christmas

16:48.007 --> 16:51.308
when mom threw the yule logs
that dad brought us up here.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.344
Wait, are you remembering this
right?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.579
God, you were this terrified
little kid.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.281
I was not a terrified kid.

16:57.283 --> 17:00.217
You were so scared that Santa was gonna
burn his bum coming down the chimney,

17:00.219 --> 17:03.721
so dad went and buried little
gifts out in the snow.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.290
You don't remember that?

17:06.291 --> 17:10.828
Maybe. Didn't he, like, ruin a
few gifts in the process?

17:10.829 --> 17:15.532
Yeah. God, he didn't really
know what he was doing.

17:21.306 --> 17:23.307
Hey, come on.

17:25.477 --> 17:27.478
It's in times like these,

17:27.480 --> 17:31.715
we just gotta remember the best selling two
seat convertible in sports car history.

17:33.485 --> 17:36.387
- The Miata!
- Mazda Miata!

17:36.389 --> 17:41.659
I should never have cosigned that loan.
- You shouldn't of.

17:41.661 --> 17:46.197
But how long was it until you, uh,
you, you found out I was lying?

17:46.199 --> 17:49.667
Oh, uh, which lie was that? That
you weren't going to college,

17:49.669 --> 17:52.703
or that you were using your tuition
money to fund your half of the Miata?

17:52.705 --> 17:55.673
Why I see that as one lie. It's
like a combo lie.

17:55.675 --> 18:01.045
Oh yeah, the old combo. Umm,
I guess like six months.

18:01.047 --> 18:05.115
Mmmm. What a great six months
that was.

18:05.117 --> 18:09.687
Dad was so proud of
his college kid.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.323
Yeah, cuz you were finally, kind
of, a normal member of society.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.658
Yeah.

18:14.660 --> 18:19.797
Well, alright I gotta go to bed.
Here, have the rest of this.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.732
Scottie, wait! I haven't seen
you since the funeral.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.869
What happened?
Did you get the girl?

18:24.871 --> 18:30.307
I, um, can't really watch you
on that I mean it's so weird.

18:30.309 --> 18:36.480
I signed a contract.
Can't talk about it.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.549
What?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.584
Since when do you give a shit
about a contract?

18:40.586 --> 18:43.187
- Let's just talk about it in the morning.
- Oh my!

18:43.189 --> 18:47.491
I can't believe you're
not gonna tell me.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.760
I'm hoping to get out of here a
little earlier.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.029
Don't we have that meeting
with the lawyer on Monday?

18:52.031 --> 18:53.097
Yeah.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.402
Scottie, what is up with that
hand?

18:58.404 --> 19:02.773
Argh, th-the u-haul umm tailgate
just kind of mangled it.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.708
Well, did you get it looked at?

19:04.710 --> 19:06.844
I'll put some ice on it.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.245
Goodnight.

20:31.429 --> 20:35.499
Um, okay.
I will. Yep.

20:40.505 --> 20:42.640
Umm, thanks doctor.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.616
Kate!

21:25.618 --> 21:27.017
Oh! Hey!

21:27.019 --> 21:28.419
What are you doing?

21:28.421 --> 21:31.422
Um, smoking.

21:31.424 --> 21:34.024
Oh. Do you have to smoke?

21:34.026 --> 21:37.394
I mean I can make you tea if
you want to relax.

21:37.396 --> 21:40.297
You were gone a long time. I thought
you were just going out for boxes.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.400
I wasn't gone that long.

21:43.402 --> 21:46.203
Boxes.

21:46.205 --> 21:48.706
- You forgot the boxes?
- Ehh.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.775
Stop looking for tea. I don't
want any tea.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.177
Do we have any Gatorade?

21:54.813 --> 21:56.547
Since when do I have Gatorade?

21:58.550 --> 22:02.352
Okay, would you please not
smoke? Pretty please?

22:02.354 --> 22:05.823
Now look, I have something to
tell you. I have...

22:13.832 --> 22:16.066
Uh, it's my team.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.335
I asked them to wait quietly.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.637
Sorry coach! Ball got away
from us.

22:20.639 --> 22:26.043
Anyway, I've hired them to help
us out.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.712
Right.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.317
As you can see,
I am in superior shape.

22:33.319 --> 22:37.020
I jog every now and then. I do like
100 push-ups a day. I cross fit.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.523
I'm looking at guys with like
11, 12 percent body fat.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.659
That's like a woman's body fat!

22:42.661 --> 22:45.129
Let'er hang, and
soak up the sun!

22:45.131 --> 22:49.099
I mean these guys are
great in the pool, man.

22:49.101 --> 22:53.170
No, which is good, cuz things
are about to get heavy.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.405
Like a rock.

22:55.407 --> 22:57.307
We all get called in
from the pool,

22:57.309 --> 22:59.476
and we never had our pool
time interrupted before.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.411
We're all gathered
in the living room,

23:01.413 --> 23:04.381
and the news is dropped by the producers,
and I'm like, Jesus man, this sucks!

23:04.383 --> 23:05.816
I mean Scottie's dad is dead.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.384
And Scottie doesn't
even know it yet.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.387
So, I do what I do in these
situations.

23:12.591 --> 23:13.991
It's dunkin daiquiri time!

23:16.895 --> 23:19.897
All right guys, let's
have a toast.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.900
To us young bucks!

23:22.902 --> 23:26.170
Ahh that's pretty good,
you know?

23:26.172 --> 23:34.172
Ooh, he's coming down the walk.

23:35.447 --> 23:38.816
I mean, we were hanging out, and the next
thing you know, we hear these footsteps

23:38.818 --> 23:44.855
and it was like damn, dunkin's daiquiris
aren't gonna be able to protect us now.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.391
How are ya?

23:47.393 --> 23:50.627
What's goin' on guys?

23:50.629 --> 23:54.398
Aw, come on, you're
not giving up already. Are ya?

23:56.801 --> 24:02.005
Because of my line of work, I took
the lead. This was gonna be tough.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.841
Hey, I made some daiquiris!

24:03.843 --> 24:06.076
- Have a daiquiri.
- No, I'm good, man. Thanks!

24:06.078 --> 24:08.946
- They're really tasty.
- Yeah, just have a daiquiri.

24:08.948 --> 24:13.750
What's going on?

24:13.752 --> 24:16.386
Take the daiquiri.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.222
I don't want the daiquiri man.

24:18.224 --> 24:22.059
- Here.
- N't want the...

24:22.061 --> 24:23.460
What the f...?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.529
I'm just trying to be nice.

24:25.531 --> 24:27.631
Sorry to say, but your father's
passed away.

24:45.683 --> 24:48.919
If the guy hadn't just
lost his father,

24:48.921 --> 24:50.320
I wouldn't have been so
pleasant.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.824
I'm standing there in my best
linen threads,

24:53.826 --> 24:56.960
dripping in daiquiri, and the
guy's losing it.

24:56.962 --> 24:58.962
What a mess.

25:10.175 --> 25:13.710
I guess he left quite
the impression on Kelly today.

25:13.712 --> 25:15.212
That's the rumor.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.174
His whole story makes
for quite the narrative now.

25:18.384 --> 25:22.119
If he stays on the show, he
could really leverage it.

25:22.121 --> 25:25.322
That said, the guy just lost
his father.

25:25.324 --> 25:30.694
He's a mess. And he doesn't
even know it yet.

25:30.696 --> 25:34.598
I'll remind him.

25:34.600 --> 25:40.637
You-you're a sneaky dude. You are sneaky.
Got my eye on you!

26:02.226 --> 26:05.228
Hey Rucke, you wanna
bring me another Phillips head?

26:05.230 --> 26:07.431
And a wrench too!

26:07.433 --> 26:11.201
Just, just right there.
Well, I don't know.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.704
No, you're doing great.
I'm not being critical.

26:13.706 --> 26:16.106
Here you go, coach! Great.
Thanks, bud! All right.

26:16.108 --> 26:19.042
You know what though, I think we
are gonna need to get a drill.

26:19.044 --> 26:22.179
Yep, these screws are rusted in
there.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.914
Don't worry. The guys will
get it down.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.683
Yeah.

26:28.052 --> 26:29.453
Hey look, are, are we cool?

26:29.455 --> 26:32.322
I mean, I'm sorry to spring the
team on you like that.

26:32.324 --> 26:36.560
No, it's um, it's just a lot.
Really.

26:36.562 --> 26:39.463
I'll tell you what, you just focus
on what you need to do in there,

26:39.465 --> 26:43.834
- and we've got everything
covered out here. Ow!

26:43.836 --> 26:47.270
- Oh. With a
little coaching, I guess.

26:47.272 --> 26:52.509
Hey, can we talk tonight? Like, no
point guards or intentions ceremonies?

26:52.511 --> 26:56.213
Whatever you need!

26:56.215 --> 27:03.020
Guys, you did good, but careful.

27:03.022 --> 27:08.692
Really, Kate? Child labor?

27:08.694 --> 27:12.262
Fitz brought them here to,
well, to fix the landscaping.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.865
After the inspection, we
promised to do a bunch of stuff

27:14.867 --> 27:19.236
- oh, uh pick up sticks?
- Yeah.

27:19.238 --> 27:23.206
Hey Scott! Good to see ya!
Good to see you too, Fitz!

27:23.208 --> 27:25.876
He's a hospital meditation
guru, right?

27:25.878 --> 27:28.760
Don't give me shit right now.
He's a reflexologist.

27:28.785 --> 27:29.813
Reflexologist.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.182
- Hey, do you have another cigarette?
- Yep.

27:32.184 --> 27:35.185
I, um, couldn't
find any. Your jacket pocket.

27:35.187 --> 27:38.171
So, uh, where did the
little dribblers come from?

27:38.196 --> 27:39.723
Ha, little dribblers!

27:39.725 --> 27:43.660
They are actually the hibbing middle
school north woods grizzlies.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.763
They were supposed to do a fundraising car
wash today, but as their assistant coach

27:46.765 --> 27:49.466
I said, "how would you guys
like to make some real money?"

27:49.468 --> 27:52.235
Oh. Smart thinking, coach.
Uh, good to see you again.

27:52.237 --> 27:54.604
Yeah. Hey, whoa, whoa,
you all right?

27:54.606 --> 27:59.042
- Ah yeah. Just a little ged up.
- All right. Well, it's good to see ya!

27:59.044 --> 28:02.612
I didn't get a chance to see much of
your show, but I caught a few episodes,

28:02.614 --> 28:09.252
and uh from what I saw, you came across as,
you know, someone with verisimilitude.

28:09.254 --> 28:12.155
Thanks! That was my intention.

28:12.157 --> 28:14.891
Well you know, sometimes
intention is all we have.

28:14.893 --> 28:18.628
For instance these guys. Last year
their record was one and nine.

28:18.630 --> 28:24.034
- They played their hearts out every game.
- - Wow, who was their coach?

28:24.036 --> 28:27.704
- Good one. - My brother's kind of a jackass.
- No, it's good.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.907
I gotta get back to the dock. Make
sure it doesn't fall into the lake.

28:30.909 --> 28:33.176
Oh Kate, I uh, I have to head
into town.

28:33.178 --> 28:35.846
I have to deal with some post
show stuff.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.215
You just got here.

28:38.217 --> 28:41.017
I know. I just gotta send some
stuff, so.

28:41.019 --> 28:43.920
Well, I have a ton of stuff for
you to go through.

28:43.922 --> 28:46.423
Okay, well looks like you got a
pretty deep bench.

28:46.425 --> 28:49.726
I'll be back around eight or
nine. We'll throw out some shit.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.895
Shit?

28:51.897 --> 28:55.999
- What else do you want to call it?
- Uhh.

28:56.001 --> 28:59.803
Hit me on my cell if
you need anything.

28:59.805 --> 29:02.572
Great.

29:24.862 --> 29:28.732
Found your captain's log.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.700
Thanks. I guess.

29:30.702 --> 29:35.238
Scottie, what happened
on that show?

29:35.240 --> 29:38.708
What are you talking about?
What, is this about me leaving?

29:38.710 --> 29:40.477
You know what, forget it!

29:43.414 --> 29:46.416
You know, I'm sick and tired of this
passive aggressive shit you're pulling.

29:46.418 --> 29:49.352
- I made a choice to live my life!
- I never had a choice!

29:49.354 --> 29:49.352
Oh, oh, so you're playing the
martyr now?

29:49.354 --> 29:54.424
Oh, martyr? Is that what you call someone who
cared 'round the clock for our dying father?

29:54.426 --> 29:57.694
- Oh don't even start.
- I put my life on hold. My career. Okay?

29:57.696 --> 29:59.863
He's dead; And now I gotta deal
with your shit,

29:59.865 --> 30:01.865
and Fitz's shit, and my own
dumb, fucked up shit.

30:01.867 --> 30:04.501
- Just, just listen.
- Yeah, listening. Listening is a great place to start.

30:04.503 --> 30:07.003
We're gonna go through all this
stuff, and not lose anything to shit.

30:07.005 --> 30:09.739
It is shit! There's nothing here
that's gonna change who dad was,

30:09.741 --> 30:11.408
or who you think he was!

30:11.410 --> 30:13.109
End of story!

30:13.111 --> 30:15.679
Get the fuck out.

30:15.681 --> 30:17.514
Okay! Whoa! Scott! Scott!

30:17.516 --> 30:21.651
You may want to hang around because
I think I found something.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.053
Come on.

30:30.161 --> 30:32.729
Good job guys.

30:32.731 --> 30:37.234
- Huh? Oh my god.
- The kids found it buried in the sand.

30:37.236 --> 30:42.439
Oh. It's dad's scarf! It's his
scarf from that Christmas.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.708
Look, there's his initials.
Don't you remember?

30:44.710 --> 30:47.711
What are you getting at?

30:47.713 --> 30:50.247
It's weird. Dad was digging
down here these final months.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.449
I thought it was just the
chemo brain,

30:52.451 --> 30:54.884
- and the drinking.
- Kate, it's crap that floated to shore.

30:54.886 --> 30:57.854
I don't know. It looks like a
sign to me.

30:57.856 --> 31:04.427
It's a
scarf! From sears!

31:04.429 --> 31:06.196
Scottie, it's dad's scarf! He
put it down here.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.832
Oh, unbelievable! I-i mean,
are you and Indiana Fitz gonna

31:08.834 --> 31:12.035
unearth this whole place now,
ing for more treasures from dad?

31:12.037 --> 31:15.138
Maybe we are, what do you care?
Don't you have to go into town?

31:15.140 --> 31:17.707
Scott, we don't know what we
don't know.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.909
And you don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

31:19.911 --> 31:27.911
I-I'm not gonna be a part of this junior
archeological dig. No offense guys.

31:29.821 --> 31:33.690
Good job guys. Keep it up.
Let's get to China.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.729
It was like the whole energy of the place
just changed after Scottie's news.

31:39.731 --> 31:44.534
I mean, for Kelly's sake we just acted
like business as usual, you know?

31:44.536 --> 31:46.936
She didn't know yet.

31:46.938 --> 31:50.140
So Jerry comes out of the bathroom, and we
go, "Jerry you got on womens underpants!"

31:50.142 --> 31:54.244
- And he says, "well everybody
got they breaking points!"

31:54.246 --> 31:56.346
Kelly looks stunning.

31:56.348 --> 32:00.717
Some sweet eye candy to give this place
a badly needed sugar high, right?

32:00.719 --> 32:05.989
Hilarious. You are too funny.
It was like that commercial!

32:25.443 --> 32:33.316
- Hi. You look beautiful.
- Thank you

32:33.318 --> 32:36.753
so, what's up? I was told you
wanted to talk to me.

32:36.755 --> 32:44.527
Yeah. Um, uh, my dad. He's
been, he's been sick for,

32:44.529 --> 32:52.529
for some time now. And, uh I-i
just found out he passed away.

32:56.875 --> 32:59.909
I'm so sorry.

32:59.911 --> 33:06.182
It's, um, it's fine. I just,
I just gotta go home.

33:06.184 --> 33:10.487
I gotta deal with the funeral
and all that stuff, so.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.489
That's very brave of you.

33:51.695 --> 33:54.931
Guys, shut off the cameras.

33:54.933 --> 33:58.067
Shut off the cameras, dammit!

33:58.069 --> 34:01.638
This man has just lost his father!
Turn them off! All of them!

34:01.640 --> 34:07.677
Cut your mic.

34:25.797 --> 34:29.032
You know, I've seen some
sad stuff in my life.

34:29.034 --> 34:36.239
But this was like, man. Whoa.
I was like Titanic sad.

34:36.241 --> 34:41.244
We were all just glued,
watching this scene play out.

34:41.246 --> 34:46.815
Scottie using his tragedy to
position himself? No doubt.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.851
Grief is a powerful thing.

34:59.029 --> 35:02.499
Scottie! Wait a second.

35:02.501 --> 35:05.001
Uh, I just wanted to
say goodbye to you.

35:05.003 --> 35:08.004
Let yourself grieve about your
old man.

35:08.006 --> 35:14.043
I'm sure if he was anything like
you, he must have been a solid man.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.445
Thanks, man.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.615
And, don't kick yourself about
not being there.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.718
Some things we can't control.

35:21.720 --> 35:25.855
Not like you were running away
from anything, right?

35:25.857 --> 35:28.224
Right.

35:28.226 --> 35:36.226
You take care. See you on the
trail.

35:40.005 --> 35:42.839
There's nothing left to say.

35:42.841 --> 35:49.112
I'm going home.

35:49.114 --> 35:52.949
Stay tuned for more of your
favorite young buck episodes!

35:52.951 --> 35:59.756
And don't forget, the shocking season finale
this Monday 10/9 central. Mount up, America!

36:12.804 --> 36:17.674
Those gizmos can drive a
man to drink.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.809
I like to keep it simple.

36:19.811 --> 36:22.779
Nice.

36:22.781 --> 36:25.715
I don't wanna make a fuss,
but please know

36:25.717 --> 36:30.019
I truly do send my condolences
to you and your family.

36:30.021 --> 36:37.460
Well, you are the Olson boy, the one on
the TV on the looney toon program, yes?

36:37.462 --> 36:39.996
Yeah.

36:39.998 --> 36:43.299
You know, I knew your dad in
the early '70s.

36:43.301 --> 36:46.002
We met at an underwriter's
convention.

36:46.004 --> 36:51.741
Oh, pardon me! Elmer Severson,
state farm agent 43 years.

36:51.743 --> 36:55.011
Scottie. Nice to meet you.

36:55.013 --> 36:59.015
Your dad was quite the catch at
the '71 convention.

36:59.017 --> 37:04.053
You see, my daughter was helpin'
out on the convention floor,

37:04.055 --> 37:09.058
and boy did he use a
line on her.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.261
My dad? He, he tried to pick up
your daughter?

37:12.263 --> 37:15.865
He walks up and he says,

37:15.867 --> 37:23.867
"miss, I fear you've just
accelerated my death benefit."

37:24.909 --> 37:28.412
Yeah. Death benefit's
a life insurance term.

37:28.437 --> 37:29.579
Ahh.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.315
Guess you have to be in the industry.
- Ah, guess so.

37:32.317 --> 37:35.718
I didn't know my dad was such a
Casanova.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.555
Well, I suppose there's a lot
we never know.

37:39.557 --> 37:45.728
So, your dad came to me three
sheets to the wind, all in tears.

37:45.730 --> 37:50.333
Hey, that must have been
the '72 convention.

37:50.335 --> 37:54.937
See, he was in love with my
daughter and,

37:54.939 --> 37:59.642
well, she had three other convention
guys competing for her heart.

37:59.644 --> 38:05.314
Oh, and he's begging me to do something.
He's hollering and carrying on and,

38:05.316 --> 38:09.786
well, she ended up in the arms
of some fella from Iowa.

38:09.788 --> 38:15.091
Iowa.

38:15.093 --> 38:19.362
I didn't realize Randy retired
up here until I read the obit.

38:19.364 --> 38:21.364
Would've looked him up.

38:23.600 --> 38:31.600
You know, there's a loss of all that was and
then there's a loss of all that wasn't.

38:34.145 --> 38:38.981
It's the wasn't that seems to
drive folks a little nutty.

38:38.983 --> 38:43.152
Leaves them
kinda rudderless for awhile.

38:53.731 --> 38:58.067
Hey, looks like all the other kids got
picked up. Is your mom not here yet?

38:58.069 --> 39:01.704
No, my mom's always late.

39:01.706 --> 39:09.706
- Well, um, hop in. I'll wait with you.
- Thanks.

39:11.816 --> 39:16.886
- Well, um, hop in. I'll wait with you.
- Thanks.

39:16.888 --> 39:22.725
I don't know what stations you guys like to
listen to around here, so whatever you want.

39:22.727 --> 39:28.664
My mom's onto Christian rock right now.
It's the worst, but I don't say nothin'.

39:28.666 --> 39:31.300
Oh uh, I don't, I don't listen
to that.

39:35.305 --> 39:40.510
So, do you and the team like to do this
kind of work? I imagine it's kinda strange.

39:40.512 --> 39:43.446
I guess. Beats washing cars,

39:43.448 --> 39:47.416
and we really want our entire team to go to this
basketball camp put on by the Timberwolves.

39:47.418 --> 39:49.085
You know, in the NBA?

39:49.087 --> 39:53.022
Other teams in our division go,
but our entire team hasn't.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.924
It'd really bring us to the
next level.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.827
Oh. Wow, that sounds like a
great investment.

39:57.829 --> 40:00.263
You want to see the packet?

40:00.265 --> 40:03.065
It's two weeks away from home, and
you get to stay college dorm rooms!

40:03.067 --> 40:04.467
Sure.

40:07.437 --> 40:10.206
See, they even bring in NBA
stars to offer pointers.

40:10.208 --> 40:13.776
Some guys on our team haven't been
away from home for two weeks.

40:13.778 --> 40:16.312
I haven't, but it sounds
so awesome.

40:16.314 --> 40:20.383
Ugh, I never did well at camp.
I always got so homesick.

40:20.385 --> 40:22.485
But this looks like way too
much fun.

40:22.487 --> 40:26.889
Wait. You? Homesick?

40:26.891 --> 40:29.392
Yeah, I was a kid once.

40:29.394 --> 40:35.064
Oh. Well, yeah.

40:35.066 --> 40:41.771
You probably don't know what a Walkman
is, but on my first trip to camp

40:41.773 --> 40:47.043
my dad made this sweet little recording
on a cassette tape and sent it to me.

40:47.045 --> 40:50.713
My counselors had told my
parents how homesick I was.

40:50.715 --> 40:54.747
Anyway, he recorded this
sweet little goodnight,

40:54.772 --> 40:58.120
and then the girls in
my cabin found it.

40:58.122 --> 41:02.024
And, they made so much fun of me.
Calling me daddy's goodnight girl.

41:02.026 --> 41:05.027
So humiliated.

41:05.029 --> 41:08.366
I came home so mad, I
threw the Walkman at him.

41:08.391 --> 41:11.634
It hit him in the face
and he chipped a tooth.

41:11.636 --> 41:16.772
If I were in your cabin,
I wouldn't have made fun of you.

41:16.774 --> 41:19.475
Well, not that it would have been
your cabin because I'm a boy, but...

41:19.477 --> 41:24.213
Yeah, I know what
you mean, thank you.

41:24.215 --> 41:27.116
You're very sensitive.

41:27.118 --> 41:29.886
You're more sensitive than a
lot of people I know.

41:29.888 --> 41:33.923
I don't know about
sensitive, but um.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.324
You meet a lot of people?

41:37.961 --> 41:40.696
Oh! Um,
sorry! I'm such a klutz!

41:40.698 --> 41:44.433
Oh, there's
your mom! Is that your mom?

41:44.435 --> 41:46.202
Here's your...

41:46.204 --> 41:51.607
Oh yeah, um, thanks.

41:51.609 --> 41:54.010
I'll see you tomorrow then.

41:54.012 --> 41:58.214
You should know, you'll be a
very good looking mom.

41:58.216 --> 42:06.216
- Um, thank you.
- Sure, bye. - Bye.

42:27.578 --> 42:32.048
Ah!
Od you're not a hand model, huh?

42:32.050 --> 42:33.716
That's gonna leave a scar.

42:33.718 --> 42:37.138
You should've had those
stitches out weeks ago!

42:37.163 --> 42:38.421
Yeah, I know.

42:38.423 --> 42:41.023
Think maybe I could get some
painkillers?

42:41.025 --> 42:45.861
If this is a stunt because you think you
can get painkillers from a small town doc,

42:45.863 --> 42:49.131
you've got another thing coming.

42:49.133 --> 42:50.626
No, uh, i...

42:50.651 --> 42:55.104
I'm just kiddin' ya.
Little bit of levity.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.472
Yeah.

43:00.677 --> 43:03.713
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear about
your dad.

43:03.715 --> 43:05.748
I didn't know him personally,
but I knew of him.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.751
Your sister, I do know!

43:08.753 --> 43:12.521
She's, uh, got that sweet little
nervous Nellie thing, right?

43:12.523 --> 43:15.491
- Yeah, I guess you could say
that.

43:15.493 --> 43:19.829
Yeah. The circle of life, huh?

43:19.831 --> 43:22.732
You look like good uncle
material.

43:22.734 --> 43:25.001
- That must be a nice distraction.
- Uncle?

43:25.003 --> 43:27.236
You're gonna have to clean
up your act, mister.

43:27.238 --> 43:29.505
Stop giving your sister those
cigarettes.

43:29.507 --> 43:33.776
I'd tell you to lay off the cancer
sticks, but the celebs I've treated,

43:33.778 --> 43:39.482
and I have treated a few, usually don't
listen to anybody until they're in rehab.

43:39.484 --> 43:41.584
How much you drinkin' these
days, huh?

43:41.586 --> 43:45.054
Every time I saw you on that show,
you had a drink in your hand.

43:45.056 --> 43:48.124
Yeah, the last kid was just
picked up.

43:48.126 --> 43:50.593
Oh, I was gonna, uh,
swing by the market.

43:50.595 --> 43:53.396
The kids asked me to pick up a few
things for tomorrow for them.

43:53.398 --> 43:57.033
Yeah, I know. I'm a pushover.

43:57.035 --> 43:59.235
Anyway, um, I'll be home in
like an hour.

43:59.237 --> 44:04.707
I thought maybe we could go
for that walk then?

44:04.709 --> 44:07.743
Yeah, no, I-i just thought...

44:10.380 --> 44:11.747
Yeah, we can talk in the
morning.

44:32.335 --> 44:34.970
What do we have here?

44:34.972 --> 44:42.972
In art class, snapped Angela's
bra and got detention.

44:43.414 --> 44:46.916
Katie told dad, and dad's not
talkin' to me.

44:46.918 --> 44:54.918
Katie and dad, suck it. Another day
in paradise. Phil Collins sucks.

44:56.294 --> 44:58.561
My hockey career is over.

44:58.563 --> 45:06.563
Girls don't get me. I tried to touch Casey
Stanley's boob, and she said I was a player.

45:09.807 --> 45:17.807
October 30, 1990: Dad hit a moose with his
truck on his way home from the cabin.

45:17.849 --> 45:22.518
He wasn't hurt, but he couldn't
remember anything.

45:22.520 --> 45:23.919
I was scared.

45:30.061 --> 45:35.965
With Scott gone, we all knew that it was
dunkin's belt buckle that we needed to loosen.

45:35.967 --> 45:40.536
He just embodies a man,
right down to his Cologne.

45:40.538 --> 45:44.306
He has a swagger.
Kinda reminds me of my daddy.

45:44.308 --> 45:48.244
And a sweetness that reminds me
of my grandma Ruth.

45:48.246 --> 45:50.713
Is that weird?

45:50.715 --> 45:55.951
Even darkness is not dark to Kelly. The
night is bright as day when she's around.

45:55.953 --> 46:01.290
Ahh, I hope she sees the light
I bring too. I think she does.

46:01.292 --> 46:06.295
Of course I think about that
goodbye, and it's like...

46:06.297 --> 46:09.064
I've come to believe that
everything happens for a reason.

46:09.066 --> 46:13.169
You can mourn that hole in your
heart when someone leaves,

46:13.171 --> 46:14.611
you can just fill it with a new
love.

46:16.306 --> 46:17.840
What else are you supposed to
do?

46:19.843 --> 46:22.411
To a beautiful woman.

46:22.413 --> 46:24.947
Cheers, to a handsome man!

46:27.951 --> 46:35.951
- Most of us guys, young bucks, are not known for our poetry.
- Oh?

46:35.993 --> 46:38.694
- But, I wrote something.
- You did?

46:38.696 --> 46:46.696
It's called perfection, far
from wasted. By me.

46:47.872 --> 46:51.407
"And another regrettable thing
about love"

46:51.409 --> 46:54.910
"is the ending of your walking
on your own two feet"

46:54.912 --> 46:59.315
"which took an entire life
to ground."

46:59.317 --> 47:05.254
"The whole act of love is intoxicating,
like too many six packs."

47:08.058 --> 47:12.928
"Who will be this perfect
again? No one."

47:12.930 --> 47:20.736
"For you alone are perfection,
far from wasted."

47:20.738 --> 47:23.772
Wow. That's beautiful.

47:25.141 --> 47:28.711
No one had ever written
such beautiful words for me.

47:28.713 --> 47:31.413
I was melting.

47:31.415 --> 47:33.749
All of the pain that I've felt
in love

47:33.751 --> 47:36.885
seems to wash away
in moments like that.

47:36.887 --> 47:41.056
I feel really blessed.

47:41.058 --> 47:45.828
Ever since I was a little girl when I
went to bed, I would count my blessings,

47:45.830 --> 47:50.032
and I would send my
blessings out to other people.

47:50.034 --> 47:54.503
And even though I am out with
dunkin, and the other guys,

47:54.505 --> 47:58.741
I'm sending my blessings
to Scottie.

47:58.743 --> 48:01.744
I think he needs them.

48:01.746 --> 48:05.014
He'll be the same as, as
he was. Time will heal him.

48:07.017 --> 48:10.586
I look forward to seeing him
then.

48:10.588 --> 48:11.987
One day.

49:00.937 --> 49:08.937
- Hey. Hey! Hmm?
- You awake? - No.

49:11.415 --> 49:12.815
Can I ask you something?

49:15.385 --> 49:23.385
It's a little early for 'can I ask you
something' questions. Don't you think?

49:25.696 --> 49:27.096
Right.

49:27.098 --> 49:30.599
Uh, we should probably leave
in like 20 to pick up the kids.

49:31.935 --> 49:39.141
Kate. It's about Scottie,
right? Your question?

49:39.143 --> 49:40.943
Yeah.

49:40.945 --> 49:45.547
- You're doing fine with that.
- Thanks.

49:53.556 --> 49:59.228
All right, well it's not exactly
machu Pichu, but we are moving dirt.

49:59.230 --> 50:03.365
And guess what? Today we're gonna continue
searching. We're gonna continue looking.

50:03.367 --> 50:05.501
We're gonna make this
place look nice, okay?

50:05.503 --> 50:09.438
We're gonna split you up today
as well.

50:09.440 --> 50:14.676
I know this all seems a tad ridiculous,
but you're a team. You're a family.

50:14.678 --> 50:18.647
And when you're working together, then
it doesn't matter what you're doing.

50:18.649 --> 50:20.983
You're building a bond.

50:31.728 --> 50:35.097
So when the Chisholm pioneers
start full court pressing you

50:35.099 --> 50:38.867
in the fourth quarter next year, you're
gonna be there for each other. Why?

50:38.869 --> 50:44.339
Because you have a bond that cannot
be severed. It cannot be pierced.

50:44.341 --> 50:49.178
All right guys, bring it in. Come on.
One, two, three, grizzlies!

50:49.180 --> 50:55.017
Let's work! Come on! Yeah!

50:55.019 --> 50:59.087
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:59.089 --> 51:04.293
- They uh, they find anything else?
- Uh, not really.

51:08.298 --> 51:10.732
He's kinda good with those
kids, huh?

51:10.734 --> 51:13.445
Ah, he's got 'em digging
holes, looking for treasures.

51:13.470 --> 51:15.170
He must be doin'
something right.

51:15.172 --> 51:18.207
And if you can build a sandcastle,
just for moral support...

51:18.209 --> 51:20.542
All right.

51:20.544 --> 51:22.212
So where are you off to today?

51:22.237 --> 51:24.904
Eh, I'm just gonna
hang around here today.

51:30.887 --> 51:34.323
Stop it! What are you doing? I
still have to go through all that!

51:34.325 --> 51:38.293
What, what you think you're really
gonna hold onto time, December 1975?

51:38.295 --> 51:41.129
Well, there's a reason
why he saved it.

51:41.131 --> 51:42.664
The ayatollah was the man of
the year.

51:42.666 --> 51:44.066
See?

51:44.068 --> 51:47.202
Oh, dad was a big fan of the
Ayotollah? Come on!

51:47.204 --> 51:51.974
Stop it, Scottie! People might want
this stuff. On ebay, it's worth money.

51:51.976 --> 51:55.753
Is, is that why you're taking pictures
and, and sorting so thoroughly?

51:55.778 --> 51:57.012
To sell it on ebay?

51:57.014 --> 51:59.081
Yeah!

51:59.083 --> 52:00.516
Okay.

52:00.518 --> 52:07.089
Look, if you want to help, I'll
show you the system.

52:07.091 --> 52:10.459
How much you get for that?

54:00.703 --> 54:04.272
Cheese!

54:04.274 --> 54:09.478
Chickie! I thought you were
lost to the ages. Get over here.

54:09.480 --> 54:12.848
Aw! Welcome home Chickie!

54:12.850 --> 54:15.550
Capture this moment.

54:18.554 --> 54:19.955
It smells.

54:44.480 --> 54:50.485
- Oh man, I-I'm gonna keep this photo.
That cool? Yeah.

54:50.487 --> 54:54.956
I don't have anything from
dad's single years.

54:54.958 --> 54:57.492
Kinda wonder what he was like.
Look at this.

54:57.494 --> 55:00.328
Who's that he's with? It
doesn't look like mom.

55:00.330 --> 55:08.330
- Elmer Severson's daughter.
- What are you talking about?

55:11.709 --> 55:14.376
I should probably keep these
encyclopedias.

55:14.378 --> 55:16.745
I think someone pawned half of
those.

55:16.747 --> 55:21.950
These used to be in dad's office, you know?
I'm sure I'll find a use.

55:21.952 --> 55:25.787
Maybe a couple of
those plaques for my office.

55:25.789 --> 55:27.923
That's kind of cool.

55:38.935 --> 55:43.905
Kate, what are you doing?

55:43.907 --> 55:45.807
That's so much stuff!

55:48.444 --> 55:54.483
Yeah, I know. I just, I like
the way they look, and I mean,

55:54.485 --> 55:57.686
I think these were actually a wedding
present from grandma to mom and dad.

55:57.688 --> 56:00.021
Pretty unique to the 70's.

56:00.023 --> 56:04.392
I'm kind of thinking of having a fondue
party anyway, so might as well use these.

56:14.370 --> 56:20.909
I just keep thinking
about the Nevers.

56:20.911 --> 56:25.580
How he'll never walk me down
the aisle.

56:25.582 --> 56:33.582
Never send me another one
sentence birthday card.

56:35.092 --> 56:37.092
Never meet his grandkids.

56:41.764 --> 56:46.601
That was gonna be his second
act, you know?

56:46.603 --> 56:50.539
He'd of done it differently.

56:50.541 --> 56:52.541
He'd have been a sweetheart.

56:55.077 --> 56:56.478
Maybe.

57:03.821 --> 57:06.788
Just stop. Y-you're driving
yourself crazy.

57:13.529 --> 57:18.233
It's amazing how you're just
like him.

57:18.235 --> 57:21.102
Standing there.

57:21.104 --> 57:24.105
Just terrorized by someone
who just needs a hug.

57:59.108 --> 58:04.946
Okay, I, um,
I-i-i gotta get this.

58:04.948 --> 58:08.783
Kelly!

58:08.785 --> 58:11.786
I just need to talk to you!

58:11.788 --> 58:13.788
Can you just give me a chance?

58:45.588 --> 58:47.022
I'm gonna go to bed.

58:47.024 --> 58:50.225
Fitz isn't back yet, but
I'm exhausted.

58:52.228 --> 58:53.628
Okay.

58:57.400 --> 59:04.472
So we've got that meeting in
the morning.

59:04.474 --> 59:05.874
I'll be up.

59:13.282 --> 59:15.550
Okay. Well, night.

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:38.833
Anita Severson.

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:53.048
"Dear sweet Anita, I miss you
like no one I've ever missed.

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:57.285
My heart is crushed, reduced to
driftwood on a lonely, deserted island.

01:00:57.287 --> 01:01:05.287
Please reconsider. I love you,
Randy"

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:15.397
please reconsider. I love you,
Randy"

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:20.508
I've said it from the beginning,
I'm not here to make friends.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.645
Loneliness is the true
cowboy's companion.

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:26.514
I'm myself around Kelly, and
that's all that matters.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:30.785
At least I wasn't writing plagiarized
poetry like Walt dunkin Whitman!

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:33.955
The guy thinks that he stepped right
out of a romance novel or something.

01:01:33.957 --> 01:01:36.357
You know what I mean?

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:39.127
Reg and Garreth started insinuating
that I wasn't being truthful.

01:01:39.129 --> 01:01:42.197
Please. I mean, Kelly's
amazing, right?

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:44.566
And these guys
were just feeling like

01:01:44.568 --> 01:01:48.937
time's winged chariot hurrying
near.

01:01:48.939 --> 01:01:50.638
Their days were numbered.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.340
Dunkin says he's from Georgia.

01:01:52.342 --> 01:01:56.611
I've never heard anybody from
Georgia sound like that,

01:01:56.613 --> 01:02:01.449
"time's winged chariot hurrying
near."

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:06.387
This is a once in a lifetime
opportunity to find that great love.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:09.591
It's just working out
beyond my wildest dreams.

01:02:09.593 --> 01:02:11.993
The last three guys are amazing.

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:16.865
Of course, I have my favorite, but
we'll just have to wait and see.

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:19.934
I mean there we are. Three
of us left.

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:21.603
The vultures were circling.

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:25.306
Started to feel a lil bit like
death valley, know what I mean?

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:29.310
I'm not saying that these two
suitors aren't fine gents.

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:33.581
I'm merely suggesting that a man with a horse
and stable can buy his little girl a pony.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:36.284
- A dog and pony show.
- I mean, who is this guy?

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:40.255
You guys are, you're ridiculous.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:45.793
I mean, I'm just looking to provide my
daughter with the stable of a loving family.

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:49.330
- Is that so, reg?
- Yeah!

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:54.068
Oh sh-t.

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:56.504
- That's Scottie.
- What? Oh my god!

01:02:56.506 --> 01:03:00.208
My stomach was in my throat, and my
heart was pounding out of my chest.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.844
Oh my god, he came back. Watch yourself.
Compose yourself. Compose yourself.

01:03:02.846 --> 01:03:06.714
He's not in the show. What's
he doing here? It was crazy.

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:10.652
- How you been, man? You look good.
- Hanging in there, thanks.

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:12.520
Hey man, why don't you hop
in? The water's warm.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:16.391
Kelly, can, uh, can we talk?
- Um, sure.

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:28.903
Just the dudes.
You guys wanna...

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:32.473
- no. I don't want anything with you.
- All right.

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:37.779
I've never lost somebody, and then
had them come wandering back to me.

01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:40.748
That was kind of strange.

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:43.851
I've been thinking about you a
lot for the past few weeks.

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:47.889
I've been thinking about you a
lot too.

01:03:47.891 --> 01:03:52.927
I was at the funeral just
staring at him.

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:57.632
This man I never really knew.
N-never showed any love to.

01:03:57.634 --> 01:04:00.635
This man I would always
disappoint.

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:05.773
Oh, you can't do that to
yourself.

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:10.460
I just kept thinking, what if I
just could've gone back in time?

01:04:10.485 --> 01:04:12.046
Done it differently?

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:17.485
Shown him that I could do
it right?

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:23.057
So, I wanna do it right with
you. Give me back my buckle.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:27.695
- Please.
- Scottie, don't do this.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:30.031
You don't want to be here.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:33.334
- You want to go get better.
- Look, forget about the damn show.

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:35.136
- Scottie!
- Let go of her!

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:37.572
This doesn't concern you, man.
- Yeah, it does, buck-o.

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:38.789
Do you wanna be with this guy?

01:04:38.814 --> 01:04:40.975
I mean seriously, this is
what you're gonna choose?

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:46.814
Hey, will you guys just stop? All of you,
just stop please, and just let me be alone!

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:49.083
Why did you have to come here
and mess everything up?

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:54.822
What the hell are you thinking?

01:04:54.824 --> 01:05:01.829
You're not even
supposed to be here.

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.331
This is awful.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:10.405
My heart. I know my
heart. It's so confused.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:15.743
I was just there in the heat of the moment
with Scottie and his beautiful eyes.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:19.280
You know? Those eyes
are in my dreams.

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:25.620
I have to just focus on these
other three awesome guys, right?

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:29.991
I need to give them my love.

01:05:29.993 --> 01:05:37.993
I feel like a, a little girl
trapped in some Grimm fairy tale.

01:05:38.168 --> 01:05:46.168
I'm terrible at this.

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:53.181
Scottie? Scottie?

01:05:53.183 --> 01:05:58.419
Scottie, we gotta go. Are you up?
- Shit.

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:06.421
Scottie, seriously we gotta go in
five minutes, okay? Coming, okay?

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:16.404
Scottie, seriously we gotta go in
five minutes, okay? Coming, okay?

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:24.406
"My dear sweet Kelly, I miss you like no
other. Please reconsider. I love you."

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:34.516
"My dear sweet Kelly, I miss you like no
other. Please reconsider. I love you."

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:45.032
Wait, are you leaving right
after the meeting?

01:06:45.034 --> 01:06:47.702
Yeah, I thought maybe you could
drop me off from the car.

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:51.472
What? Fitz and the team can,
you know,

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:54.041
take the u-haul, and drop
everything off at the storage unit.

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:56.645
I'll come back in a couple
of weeks and pick up my stuff.

01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:57.512
Yeah, great.

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.080
I'll pay for the team's time.

01:07:02.384 --> 01:07:03.785
Of course.

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:24.532
Is everything okay?

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:28.236
Yeah, all good.

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:32.974
Oh.

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:35.943
You know, I've, uh, called the
realtors and they've told me that

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:39.814
th-the new owners are very happy with the
way the escrow has gone so smoothly.

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:41.983
We've moved everything out of
the cabin, the personal items,

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:44.118
and just cleaned up the place
a bit.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.921
Yeah, the new owners are really
gonna love the new paint job.

01:08:46.946 --> 01:08:48.322
Brought in some Ace painters.

01:08:48.323 --> 01:08:52.460
That's terrific. You guys really go
above and beyond. That's wonderful.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:56.464
So, I just need your
signatures, uh, here and here.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.865
All right.

01:08:59.968 --> 01:09:02.937
So, you know, your
father and I, we go way back.

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:07.375
I was actually at your parent's
wedding if you can believe that.

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:11.712
You know, it speaks to his loyalty that
here we are, taking care of his estate.

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:16.250
So, there isn't much
more to go over.

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:18.953
Great. So, if that's it, we
should get going.

01:09:18.955 --> 01:09:23.524
Well, actually, uh,
there is something else.

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:27.361
After all the back taxes and the fees
have been paid off on this cabin,

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:34.835
there is gonna be a sizeable
amount of money. $90,000.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:38.305
Who knew in this market that
the cabin would do so well.

01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:41.676
It states very clearly in your
father's will,

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:44.845
that if there is any money left
over from the sale of the cabin

01:09:44.846 --> 01:09:49.649
that that money will be
distributed to Scottie

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:54.255
to pay down his debts and
to pay for his education.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:57.258
What?

01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.827
Yes. It was your father's
intention...

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:05.299
No, I understand that intention.
Um, I'm just, I'm confused.

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:09.236
It is a special circumstance.

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:11.305
M sorry, I-is this some kind of
joke?

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:13.374
No, this is no joke. It's
in his will.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:16.844
I would have told you sooner, but I
didn't wanna cause anymore grief,

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:19.513
and frankly, I mean, I didn't
think it was gonna be an issue.

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:22.173
I thought that we'd owe money.
You know? I mean,

01:10:22.198 --> 01:10:24.452
we sold the cabin for
such a slick price.

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:29.657
Am I hearing this right? I nursed my dad
through chemo, through the very, very end.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:33.327
I mean I, I left my job for months
without compensation, without question,

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:36.797
and now my brother is being rewarded
for being the absent jerkoff

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:39.300
who fucked around on a reality
television show?

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:41.335
Jesus Kate, come on!

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.971
Kate, I don't think that's
a fair characterization

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:47.842
of young bucks. I mean, that was a
fine show. It was Emmy nominated!

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:49.744
Your, your father was
very concerned about Scottie.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:52.647
I mean that-that's not
saying anything against you.

01:10:52.649 --> 01:10:55.850
I mean he had no idea that the
cabin would sell so well.

01:10:55.852 --> 01:11:00.388
The living have absolutely no idea what
they're gonna be worth when they're gone.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:04.158
So, failing out of school, and running up a
debt, and being a general fuckup is rewarded?

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:10.197
- Kate, just take it easy. Oh my god,
don't you dare tell me to take it easy.

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:14.068
I don't even know what crazy shit you're
mixed up in again with that hand of yours,

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.838
and bizarre text messages from that reality
chick saying she's gonna go to the police.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.142
You know what, take the fucking
90k. Piss it away.

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:24.178
At least I live in a world where
I have to get real with people.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:30.317
I mean, hah, that kid of yours is gonna be
real lucky to have such a nut job as a mother.

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:34.355
How dare you? Have you been
going through my shit?

01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:41.162
You fucking bitch.

01:11:41.164 --> 01:11:43.631
I'm done.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:51.633
Go, get the fuck out!

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:54.775
- Congratulations on the baby.
- Oh fuck you, Bob!

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:15.730
She doesn't wanna see you.
I know.

01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:19.834
If I let you on during tonight's buckle
ceremony, what are you gonna do?

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:23.938
Apologize. That's all.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:29.643
That's all you wanna do?
- That's all I wanna do.

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:33.948
Well, that is
very thoughtful of you.

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:36.250
And it also makes for really
good TV.

01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:39.887
Yeah. That's what
I'm here for.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:42.890
Let's get you
another beer, or maybe a shot.

01:13:00.675 --> 01:13:02.676
Reginald.

01:13:07.482 --> 01:13:10.484
I'm sorry. Your buckle, please.

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:26.567
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:29.670
Kelly.

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:37.672
I-I came back for
you. I-i don't wanna lose you.

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:40.247
Leave, please. Scottie.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:43.818
You've been told to go home. Go home.
- Kelly, don't.

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:49.590
D-don't, don't, don't do this.
- Please, just go. Please.

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:51.392
- Stop torturing this woman.
- Dunkin, please.

01:13:51.394 --> 01:13:53.494
Just get the hell outta
here, man!

01:13:53.496 --> 01:13:55.362
I'm just trying to talk to
Kelly all right, just...

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:57.231
Aw, come on guys!

01:13:57.233 --> 01:13:59.099
Whoa, man!

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:02.403
Oh! Aw man, get off of him.
Come on!

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:08.809
- Come on!
- Get off me!

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:11.078
No! Argh!

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.548
I'm gonna sue your ass, man!

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:19.019
Mother f... r. Do
you even love her?

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:21.555
Love? Do you think I even know
Kelly?

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:23.691
Do you think any of these
guys do?

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:26.427
Jesus man, we know
she's good in the sack,

01:14:26.429 --> 01:14:28.762
but that's about it. It's a
f-ing game.

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:31.298
It's not a f-ing game to me
mother f-er.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.700
Stop.

01:14:36.304 --> 01:14:37.705
Dude, cool off.

01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:51.305
All right, kids are gonna meet
us by the storage locker.

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:57.711
You okay?

01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:05.986
You ever think that maybe he's
in a better place?

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:09.623
And this is the way it's
supposed to be?

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:13.327
You know, he's looking down on
you right now.

01:17:13.329 --> 01:17:21.329
And yet, I'm just here,
watching the world go by.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:28.809
You know, I've been trying to
talk to you for days.

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:32.379
I know.

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:35.883
I get it. You've changed.
I've changed.

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:38.452
You know, I didn't even want to
have this conversation right now.

01:17:38.454 --> 01:17:41.789
- I wanted to deal with everything
first and then... - what conversation?

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:46.593
Oh please. I just wanted to unload the
truck, and then take care of the kids.

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:49.563
Then the two of us could go our
separate ways, and take a break.

01:17:49.565 --> 01:17:54.234
- And have a child together.
- Come on.

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:57.905
Yeah.

01:17:57.907 --> 01:18:00.574
Kate, sweetie, I-i am so sorry.

01:18:00.576 --> 01:18:04.878
- You have to go now, okay? No, you can't
tell me that and then ask me to leave.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:11.618
Fitz, you need to go, and you need to let
me say goodbye to this place without you.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:17.299
Okay. I mean, if that is
your intention, then fine.

01:18:17.324 --> 01:18:19.593
Please, just go.

01:18:19.595 --> 01:18:24.598
Okay.

01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:24.691
This search for love and
connection, it's so maddening.

01:19:24.693 --> 01:19:31.198
It needs one of those little decoders
you find at the bottom of cereal boxes.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.034
I came on this show not
knowing what I would find.

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:36.870
I just knew that I was over
the pain of losing.

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:41.975
And I was over the pain
of a broken heart.

01:19:58.494 --> 01:20:05.265
So many guys I've dated, I've had to
search for that language of love.

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:07.901
Is he in love with me?

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:11.505
Or, is he just in love with me because
he's supposed to be in love with me?

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:16.977
Am I supposed to be in
love with him?

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:21.782
The uncertainty of those
questions is just terrifying.

01:20:21.784 --> 01:20:24.885
I just want it to be clear.

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:29.823
This is a dream come true!

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:33.894
Are you gonna put it on me?

01:20:33.896 --> 01:20:37.331
I love you, and you love me.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:11.231
But there, with dunkin
as the sun set,

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:15.836
I no longer had these
irritating worries.

01:21:15.838 --> 01:21:21.108
It was a dream come
true. I was set free.

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:29.110
So madly in love. And
so was he.

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:12.125
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:19.466
Looks like you, uh, have
some extra storage space.

01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:22.135
Underwater storage.

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:28.842
Uh, where, where are Fitz
and the Ballers?

01:22:28.844 --> 01:22:33.347
I sent them home.

01:22:33.349 --> 01:22:36.850
- Okay. Well, uh... - what are
you doing here, Scottie?

01:22:36.852 --> 01:22:42.689
Didn't you have to go after
your reality girl?

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:50.691
- I came back, so you could hear this.
- What are you doing?

01:22:52.234 --> 01:22:55.902
All right Katie, well your
mother and I are heading to bed.

01:22:55.904 --> 01:23:01.408
Well, I am. Your mother's fallen asleep
reading some book about what's wrong with me.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:06.646
The news here is that Scottie is grounded.
I guess that's not really new news.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:09.162
He sold s-z of our world books.
Turns out,

01:23:09.187 --> 01:23:11.852
he's been skipping his
summer school classes,

01:23:11.854 --> 01:23:17.257
and selling the books one by one
to that antique shop on Lindale.

01:23:17.259 --> 01:23:21.561
He does make life interesting with
his ways of avoiding responsibility.

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:25.832
I suppose he gets that from me.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:30.904
All right, now I know you only talk
to your mother about your worries.

01:23:30.906 --> 01:23:36.943
I'm here to remind you to just
relax and squeeze Chickie.

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:41.349
That's what she told me to say.
I'm bad at this.

01:23:41.374 --> 01:23:44.969
Please, don't worry.
Go have some fun!

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:50.082
All is fine here. Even
with your nutty brother.

01:23:50.107 --> 01:23:53.226
He did ask when you're
coming home today.

01:23:53.228 --> 01:23:55.829
Nice to hear his voice, huh?

01:23:55.831 --> 01:24:00.467
Sleep well. Love you.

01:24:00.469 --> 01:24:02.302
I miss him.

01:24:02.304 --> 01:24:07.174
I miss him too.

01:24:07.176 --> 01:24:15.176
Come on. Let's go
say goodbye.

01:24:33.702 --> 01:24:41.041
You're it!

01:24:41.043 --> 01:24:44.511
Look what I found! Pirate
treasure!
