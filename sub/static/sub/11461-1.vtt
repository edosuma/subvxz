Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha.

00:14.432 --> 00:16.698
-Okay. This is how it all started.

00:18.033 --> 00:21.016
Four kids with nothing in
common got lost in a forest,

00:21.604 --> 00:25.066
and ended up in an alternate
universe where they were never born.

00:25.854 --> 00:26.854
Bummer, right?

00:29.315 --> 00:30.848
That was Felix's fault.

00:31.326 --> 00:32.703
My brother.

00:33.412 --> 00:36.895
He discovered that hidden inside
some people are elemental

00:36.921 --> 00:40.344
forces that can be used together
to create powerful magic.

00:42.994 --> 00:44.594
Felix is a fire element.

00:44.932 --> 00:46.599
He controls living flame.

00:48.283 --> 00:50.550
Andy is the brainiac of the group.

00:50.666 --> 00:52.066
His element is water.

00:53.283 --> 00:54.689
Sam is air.

00:54.979 --> 00:57.254
In element and in nature.

00:58.586 --> 01:01.749
Jake is earth. Solid,
dependable and normal.

01:02.328 --> 01:03.328
Sort of.

01:04.047 --> 01:07.938
Then three's me, Oscar.
The spirit that holds everything together.

01:08.742 --> 01:10.809
I have kind of magical visions.

01:12.330 --> 01:16.002
Fighting demons, and each other

01:16.823 --> 01:19.135
they finally found their way home.

01:20.260 --> 01:22.793
Bringing with them a magical talisman,

01:23.946 --> 01:27.860
and discovering a secret lair
hidden in Bremin high school.

01:30.892 --> 01:32.561
But, who built it?

01:34.064 --> 01:35.397
And why is it there?

01:57.029 --> 01:59.496
- You're never gonna
give up, are you?

02:00.076 --> 02:02.343
- Must be a clue in
here somewhere.

02:02.529 --> 02:04.996
-Too bad they didn't leave a name tag.

02:05.209 --> 02:08.223
- How can someone leave all this
but no clue of who they are?

02:10.467 --> 02:11.667
I need more light.

02:12.443 --> 02:13.510
-Felix, careful.

02:14.427 --> 02:15.427
-Oops.

02:18.623 --> 02:20.712
-Lucky I'm a water element.

02:21.903 --> 02:24.940
I hope those spells aren't crucial
to the survival of the universe.

02:25.114 --> 02:26.514
-Well, in my luck...

02:31.481 --> 02:34.776
Even if we can't find the owner,
this is still the perfect headquarters.

02:35.552 --> 02:36.552
-For?

02:36.770 --> 02:38.481
-The greatest magic group of all time.

02:39.598 --> 02:42.260
- I'm not sure if you've
noticed, Felix, but

02:42.284 --> 02:45.687
Jake and Sam are only interested
in themselves these days,

02:46.286 --> 02:49.860
- Yeah, and Andy's off on
some top-secret nerd quest.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.054
He's barely even at school.

02:52.434 --> 02:55.424
-And without all four elements, no magic.

02:58.702 --> 03:01.605
- They've just been busy. We'll
get them back; We're a team.

03:06.999 --> 03:09.599
- What if it's time
for a change, Felix?

03:10.116 --> 03:11.650
You're fire, I'm water,

03:11.999 --> 03:14.532
if we find new water
and air elements,

03:14.960 --> 03:16.493
we can form a new team.

03:16.874 --> 03:18.104
-And dump the others?

03:18.128 --> 03:21.126
- Technically they've already dumped you.
- No one's dumping anyone.

03:21.608 --> 03:22.608
Okay?

03:39.990 --> 03:43.036
A secret compartment?
- In a secret compartment.

03:43.060 --> 03:45.060
That's a lot of secrets.

03:48.426 --> 03:51.808
- The Book of Shadows?
- Ancient. Cool.

03:58.298 --> 04:00.509
- It won't budge.
- Needs some girl power.

04:02.017 --> 04:04.704
- Why won't it open?
- Magically sealed.

04:05.978 --> 04:09.071
Whatever's in there, must be good.
- Insanely good.

04:09.220 --> 04:10.753
-So, how do we open it?

04:13.321 --> 04:14.700
-This is just what we need.

04:22.893 --> 04:26.039
- Make sure you film me putting the
Vanguardium in the magnetic field.

04:26.063 --> 04:27.485
-Andy, I know.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.069
Where the lines all intersect,

04:31.378 --> 04:33.897
there is an increase in
ambient magnetic fields.

04:34.573 --> 04:36.974
Vanguardium acts as a sensor.

04:45.639 --> 04:47.631
My research says this has to be it.

04:47.905 --> 04:48.905
-Your research?

04:50.623 --> 04:51.623
-This is it!

04:53.764 --> 04:54.764
The camera!

04:56.327 --> 04:58.848
My studies using science and magic,

04:58.871 --> 05:01.702
will change the foundations
of scientific knowledge.

05:01.726 --> 05:03.434
The very way we see the world.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.645
Why aren't you filming? Look!
- Andy!

05:07.061 --> 05:09.114
Who discovered the lines
in the first place?

05:09.436 --> 05:11.545
Who told you about
these intersections?

05:11.600 --> 05:14.271
Me!
- Yes your daughter has been very helpful.

05:14.350 --> 05:16.987
- Can you hear yourself?
You're an egomaniac.

05:21.342 --> 05:22.342
It's Felix.

05:22.561 --> 05:25.874
- Why's he calling you?
- Because you never answer him.

05:26.537 --> 05:30.070
Maybe he can film your
experiments, because I'm done.

05:51.207 --> 05:53.235
- Yeah... Yeah...
- Whoo!

05:54.558 --> 05:57.372
- He amplified.
- That was mad, brah.

05:57.396 --> 05:59.659
Sick move.
- Well, what did you expect?

06:00.996 --> 06:03.659
And that's it. My first
pro video with Gleamer.

06:03.683 --> 06:05.683
I'm super excited.

06:05.707 --> 06:08.888
Mad props for my new Gleamer board.
Couldn't do my tricks without it.

06:09.144 --> 06:11.611
- Welcome to the family, kid.
- Sweet!

06:12.925 --> 06:14.787
I'll be right back.
- Do your thing.

06:15.402 --> 06:16.402
Mia!

06:18.175 --> 06:20.663
Where are you going?
- Really Sam?

06:21.074 --> 06:23.675
You asked me here to admire
you using your powers?

06:23.699 --> 06:24.878
-Well, yeah.

06:25.253 --> 06:26.442
No, I mean, I mean...

06:26.467 --> 06:28.864
- Hurry. Rescue him before he
says something intelligent.

06:28.888 --> 06:29.898
-Please sign my board.

06:31.323 --> 06:34.490
- Twenty bucks for selfies,
ten for pencil cases and t-shirts.

06:34.514 --> 06:36.678
- How, how much to
sign body parts?

06:36.702 --> 06:38.160
-That's just weird.

06:39.410 --> 06:42.768
- Alright, that's the last of it.
- Whoohoo!

06:44.892 --> 06:46.359
-Exciting, hey, Jakey?

06:47.986 --> 06:48.986
Eh?

06:49.298 --> 06:50.765
- Yes.
- A fresh start.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.259
All gonna work out beautifully, mate.

07:00.082 --> 07:01.082
-Go on.

07:01.543 --> 07:03.679
We'll finish up here, won't we?
- Yeah.

07:04.355 --> 07:07.003
- Go see your friends, Jake.
- It's cool, mum.

07:07.041 --> 07:08.830
I'm just stressed.

07:08.855 --> 07:11.749
We get two training scouts coming tomorrow.
I wanna be on top of my game.

07:15.377 --> 07:19.808
- When the boys went to the other universe,
Andy met an alternate version of Ellen

07:20.158 --> 07:21.624
and they fell in love.

07:23.900 --> 07:29.493
Since coming back to this universe,
things have been, well, awkward.

07:30.072 --> 07:31.072
-Guys...

07:31.650 --> 07:32.650
Uh...

07:34.166 --> 07:35.166
Hey, Ellen.

07:36.705 --> 07:37.705
-Hey Andy.

07:38.877 --> 07:40.010
Uh, been a while.

07:41.322 --> 07:43.455
-I didn't realize you'd be here.

07:44.615 --> 07:49.548
- You. I was worried this whole love
triangle thing had lost its weirdness.

07:51.161 --> 07:52.161
-This is it.

07:55.997 --> 07:56.997
-Fascinating!

07:58.529 --> 08:01.011
Do you think whoever this
belongs to created the lair?

08:01.365 --> 08:02.365
-Has to.

08:03.013 --> 08:04.080
I can't open it.

08:04.615 --> 08:08.348
And I've got spells to go to other
dimensions, to create scrying pools,

08:08.669 --> 08:10.270
you'd think opening a
book would be easy.

08:11.263 --> 08:12.263
What?

08:14.052 --> 08:16.044
- You coming to me
for magic advice.

08:16.349 --> 08:17.900
It feels like a personal triumph.

08:19.325 --> 08:21.019
-I could have figured it out myself.

08:21.411 --> 08:22.411
Eventually.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.435
-Give me a break, both of you.

08:27.380 --> 08:28.713
-I think I can help.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.333
-Ooh, laminated.

08:31.068 --> 08:32.368
-That's your Book Of Shadows?

08:32.393 --> 08:35.501
- I got pretty deep researching
traversable wormholes on the web.

08:35.841 --> 08:36.841
-The web?

08:37.599 --> 08:39.953
So you found a spell written
by a Harry Potter fan?

08:40.068 --> 08:42.323
- magic and technology
don't have to be at odds.

08:42.615 --> 08:45.199
Not every spell in comprised
by candlelight and quill.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.430
I found an unlocking spell.

08:50.068 --> 08:51.201
-This could work!

08:51.513 --> 08:53.872
With a bit of Felix pizzazz.

08:55.568 --> 08:59.231
- Who would have thought? You two
long lost lovers together again.

09:00.286 --> 09:01.584
-Let me know when you open it.

09:02.490 --> 09:04.478
I'd like to see it.
- Where are you going?

09:05.661 --> 09:07.701
- You've already got a water
element for your spell.

09:08.052 --> 09:09.252
You don't need me.

09:11.216 --> 09:13.348
-Andy, come back.

09:15.450 --> 09:16.517
It's your spell.

09:17.302 --> 09:18.302
You do it.

09:19.443 --> 09:21.176
The next one's mine, okay?

09:25.271 --> 09:26.868
Let's get them some their time.

09:26.893 --> 09:28.100
-Wait, why do I have to go?

09:28.126 --> 09:30.492
- Because I'm not gonna be the
only one who misses out.

09:32.724 --> 09:35.755
- We're still gonna need Jake and Sam.
- I tried calling them.

09:36.896 --> 09:39.808
- You might need to
be bit more... persuasive.

09:46.177 --> 09:49.124
- Ho, nice one!
- The guys gotta love you.

09:49.148 --> 09:50.646
Hold on.

09:52.742 --> 09:55.991
- Your phone is going mental.
Probably an emergency or something.

10:02.593 --> 10:05.055
- What is it, Felix?
- We've got a situation here.

10:05.406 --> 10:07.192
You idiots have gotten
yourself into trouble.

10:07.217 --> 10:08.408
Come down here. - Ryles!

10:08.433 --> 10:09.648
- ...we need your help.

10:09.672 --> 10:11.904
- You want to win this
scholarship, you need to focus.

10:12.843 --> 10:13.843
-Yes, coach.

10:17.070 --> 10:19.403
-Riles, where are you going? Riles!

10:23.490 --> 10:25.464
-Ha... it's comfy.

10:25.990 --> 10:28.620
- Catches light. You ready?
- I was born ready.

10:29.497 --> 10:30.630
-Wilfred’s phone.

10:30.656 --> 10:32.081
- ...an emergency.
Get down here...

10:32.113 --> 10:34.417
- Sam, there's someone yelling
something about danger.

10:35.670 --> 10:36.737
-It's just them.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.175
It's just a private joke.
Don't worry, they're friends.

10:39.410 --> 10:42.152
I'll be right back. - Sam! Sam!

10:43.340 --> 10:45.073
-I know it's been awkward

10:45.951 --> 10:47.215
between us since you got back.

10:47.904 --> 10:49.371
-It’s not your fault.

10:50.045 --> 10:51.888
I've kinda been focused
on other things.

10:52.537 --> 10:53.537
-It's just...

10:55.177 --> 10:57.273
the four of us have been
through so much together.

10:58.295 --> 10:59.561
Sucks to lose that.

11:03.135 --> 11:04.412
-This emergency better be good.

11:04.437 --> 11:07.158
I just skipped on the single most
important practice of my life.

11:07.204 --> 11:09.100
-It is an emergency, I swear.

11:09.155 --> 11:11.301
-Alright, who do I put on blast?

11:12.080 --> 11:15.108
- Was your jacket so reflective?
- It's fashion, Andy.

11:15.366 --> 11:17.053
-Is there a functional reason?

11:17.218 --> 11:19.499
- It doesn't... it doesn't need a reason.
I'm modeling it.

11:19.765 --> 11:23.208
- You're a model of what, zit cream?
- Guys, we're a team, remember?

11:24.116 --> 11:27.163
- You said this was a life or
death emergency, remember?

11:28.695 --> 11:30.998
-Okay. I was a bit dramatic.

11:31.631 --> 11:33.115
But it's kind of life or death.

11:33.421 --> 11:34.421
For our magic.

11:35.046 --> 11:38.403
- Felix found an ancient book in the lair.
If we can open it...

11:38.435 --> 11:40.408
- Through magic we could have.
- Wait...

11:40.632 --> 11:41.632
What?

11:41.656 --> 11:43.358
-We're here so you can play with magic?

11:43.382 --> 11:46.548
-No, Jake... I can't open this without you.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.664
I need the four of us to cast the spell.

11:50.845 --> 11:51.845
It's...

11:52.556 --> 11:53.556
I thought...

11:53.923 --> 11:55.523
this book might help us.

11:55.931 --> 11:58.836
- What's gonna help is me not
missing my footage trials.

11:59.079 --> 12:00.977
I just wanna get my scholarship
and get out of Bremin.

12:01.001 --> 12:02.704
-Hey dude, I got my elemental power.

12:02.729 --> 12:06.111
Who needs a drag of talisman and
magic spells when I can just do this?

12:08.821 --> 12:10.021
-I've spent months

12:10.446 --> 12:12.051
trying to find the owner of the lair;

12:12.876 --> 12:14.379
This book could hold the answer.

12:16.196 --> 12:17.196
Please.

12:18.009 --> 12:19.142
I need your help.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.903
And if we open the book,
no more hand holding?

12:23.915 --> 12:24.607
That's the plan.

12:24.712 --> 12:26.112
-And then we're done?

12:27.649 --> 12:28.649
-I guess.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.654
-Let's get this over with.

13:03.608 --> 13:04.742
-Before we begin,

13:05.483 --> 13:06.483
I wanna say

13:06.686 --> 13:07.686
all four of us

13:07.999 --> 13:10.350
together again, it's great.
Really, I mean...

13:10.374 --> 13:12.374
- Hurry up!
- Okay, okay!

13:13.288 --> 13:16.488
- (all together) Keeper
of wisdom, hear my call.

13:16.733 --> 13:19.597
Transcend your bonds
and reveal to all.

13:20.178 --> 13:21.178
Earth,

13:21.342 --> 13:22.342
water

13:22.483 --> 13:23.483
air

13:23.694 --> 13:24.694
fire.

13:32.069 --> 13:33.069
-A talisman!

13:36.282 --> 13:38.401
-Well, that was unexpected.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.208
- I knew this book was
gonna be special.

13:51.256 --> 13:54.439
- Is it too much to as for
things to go right for once?

14:01.170 --> 14:03.057
-Felix, what the hell?

14:05.756 --> 14:07.489
-Team, here lies a demon,

14:08.317 --> 14:10.185
Tree! - Focus, Andy!

14:10.210 --> 14:12.487
-I've got this! I've got this!

14:17.513 --> 14:18.513
-Alright, boys.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.867
Sam, get the talisman. - Hurry!

14:24.697 --> 14:26.030
Okay, let's do this!

14:26.055 --> 14:29.203
- (all together) Water,
fire, earth and air,

14:29.228 --> 14:31.162
elements that we all share.

14:31.186 --> 14:35.867
Water, fire, earth and air,
elements that we all share.

14:44.881 --> 14:47.060
-Another Felix Ferne epic fail.

14:47.506 --> 14:50.481
- If we'd work together...
- Did you burn my eyebrow off?

14:51.201 --> 14:52.201
You did!

14:54.498 --> 14:55.498
-It's twisted.

14:56.654 --> 14:59.483
The most important game of my life
tomorrow and my ankle's done.

14:59.507 --> 15:02.563
- I had no idea that would happen.
- How many times have we heard that?

15:02.764 --> 15:04.419
-We did succeed in opening the book.

15:04.443 --> 15:06.443
- Yeah, but I'm down one eyebrow.
- Sam?

15:07.521 --> 15:08.648
No one cares.

15:08.881 --> 15:10.837
-My fans care! They want two of them!

15:10.928 --> 15:12.388
- Felix...
- Fans? Are you kidding me?

15:12.427 --> 15:17.141
- You're right. This book of Shadows uses
the most complex spell I've ever seen.

15:17.794 --> 15:18.794
-Incredible!

15:19.669 --> 15:21.742
With this magic, we'll
be stronger than ever.

15:21.825 --> 15:22.825
-No!

15:23.630 --> 15:24.630
No more magic!

15:25.411 --> 15:26.411
No more...

15:28.138 --> 15:29.138
this.

15:29.638 --> 15:30.838
I'm sorry, hombre,

15:30.911 --> 15:32.520
but in case you haven't noticed,

15:32.825 --> 15:34.167
we suck together.

15:36.638 --> 15:37.872
- Andy?
- Well...

15:39.154 --> 15:40.154
I am curious.

15:40.935 --> 15:42.566
But you've got Helen as a water element.

15:42.590 --> 15:45.262
- But if we're not together,
than we can't do magic spells.

15:45.302 --> 15:46.502
-That's the point!

15:47.497 --> 15:48.631
-Not necessarily.

15:49.685 --> 15:51.685
This is a spell of separation.

15:52.411 --> 15:53.946
So we can do magic individually.

15:55.075 --> 15:56.806
-It can break the bond between us.

15:58.857 --> 15:59.857
Guys, wait!

16:02.404 --> 16:04.808
- There's one problem, though.
- What is it?

16:06.458 --> 16:08.105
-We have to destroy the talisman.

16:12.708 --> 16:13.708
Thanks guys,

16:14.075 --> 16:15.809
This means a lot to Felix.

16:16.177 --> 16:18.312
His life is kind of
meaningless without magic.

16:19.607 --> 16:20.607
-Thanks, Andy.

16:21.396 --> 16:24.116
- If I do this, you'll give me a spell
to get my eyebrow back, right?

16:24.427 --> 16:25.993
- You can do the
spell on your own.

16:37.485 --> 16:38.752
I don't know, guys.

16:39.563 --> 16:40.882
Doesn't that seem crazy?

16:41.157 --> 16:42.344
Splitting the talisman?

16:42.649 --> 16:45.377
- You didn't seem so worried when
you let a light demon loose on us.

16:45.657 --> 16:46.657
-Felix,

16:47.001 --> 16:48.001
to unbind us

16:48.345 --> 16:49.594
we have to split it.

16:49.619 --> 16:51.619
-But it protects us.

16:51.751 --> 16:52.817
-Imagine, Felix.

16:53.274 --> 16:54.274
Our own magic.

16:55.235 --> 16:56.435
It's the only way.

17:01.540 --> 17:04.138
- (all together) What
was four shall be one,

17:04.313 --> 17:06.646
and what was one shall now be four,

17:07.281 --> 17:09.671
Find the elements to each shard,

17:09.766 --> 17:11.833
and hold the power of them all.

17:21.798 --> 17:22.798
-That's it?

17:23.314 --> 17:24.314
-What now?

17:25.470 --> 17:26.973
-I suppose we take one each.

17:27.595 --> 17:30.586
- No, thanks. I'm done!
- Come on, Jake!

17:30.908 --> 17:32.534
Just remember what
we've been through.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.681
-We'll still see each other at school.

17:47.968 --> 17:49.487
- Unless you get
your scholarship.

17:50.421 --> 17:52.178
-I'll be back on weekends.

17:53.304 --> 17:54.887
-We can share our findings, right?

17:55.304 --> 17:56.571
The book of spells?

17:56.812 --> 17:58.531
-Yeah, I guess so.

18:07.683 --> 18:08.683
-I guess...

18:09.261 --> 18:11.130
- ...that's it then.
- Wait, can men hug?

18:12.050 --> 18:13.050
-You think?

18:14.433 --> 18:16.367
-Not really necessary, is it?

18:22.203 --> 18:23.536
-Then there was one.

19:01.113 --> 19:04.520
- There is so much hidden beneath
the surface of our world,

19:04.707 --> 19:07.659
so much that we don't
see or understand,

19:08.137 --> 19:09.470
like negative space,

19:09.785 --> 19:12.519
a place that exists
in between universes.

19:13.629 --> 19:15.651
For a while, Andy was lost there.

19:15.941 --> 19:17.725
But then, he met Bear,

19:17.887 --> 19:19.953
the guardian of negative space.

19:20.831 --> 19:24.631
Bear keeps all the craziness
of the multi-verse in order.

19:25.269 --> 19:27.669
But, to do that he needs human help.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.693
His latest recruits are our friends,

19:31.433 --> 19:32.672
Phoebe and Alice.

19:35.573 --> 19:37.155
-Imagine a galaxy.

19:38.276 --> 19:39.276
Good.

19:40.675 --> 19:42.208
Now imagine the cosmos.

19:46.404 --> 19:47.795
-I could get used to this.

19:50.724 --> 19:52.091
-There's something wrong.

19:52.310 --> 19:53.685
-A disturbance?

19:54.513 --> 19:56.113
-More than that, I fear.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.300
-I can't see anything.

20:04.669 --> 20:06.406
Why are the shadows spreading?

20:06.833 --> 20:10.299
- They're hiding something.
- Order must be restored.

20:11.356 --> 20:12.356
-Let me go in.

20:23.827 --> 20:25.227
-Another disturbance.

20:27.022 --> 20:28.222
-Your turn, Tegan.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.315
- Maybe we should wait for
Alice..I'm... I'm new to this.

20:31.546 --> 20:32.860
-You are a Guardian.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.566
It is your duty.

20:35.397 --> 20:36.464
Don't be afraid.

20:37.311 --> 20:38.311
I'll power you.

20:38.772 --> 20:39.772
Bear taught me.

20:41.973 --> 20:44.208
-Whoa! Whoa, that tickles!

20:47.825 --> 20:49.615
Order must be restored.

21:07.168 --> 21:10.132
- Someone's having a good time.
- Dad's specialty.

21:10.433 --> 21:13.233
Rubbery pancakes and
music by dead people.

21:13.652 --> 21:15.918
- You look wrecked.
- I feel worse.

21:16.589 --> 21:19.034
- How'd it go?
- We opened it.

21:19.860 --> 21:23.075
But in the process,
we... kind of broke up.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.250
-Sorry.

21:28.539 --> 21:29.905
But maybe it's a good thing.

21:30.633 --> 21:32.844
There's so much magical
potential in Bremin

21:33.196 --> 21:35.819
that all we have to do is
find two new elements.

21:36.250 --> 21:38.517
And then we can form our own team.

21:38.938 --> 21:40.671
We still got the talisman.

21:43.467 --> 21:44.467
-Actually...

21:46.936 --> 21:50.136
something else happened
when we opened the book.

21:51.022 --> 21:52.622
-You broke the talisman?

21:53.436 --> 21:54.913
-I have to show you something.

22:05.209 --> 22:06.209
Elements,

22:06.451 --> 22:07.761
reveal and show

22:08.435 --> 22:09.435
what I seek,

22:09.928 --> 22:11.061
what I must know.

22:12.428 --> 22:13.428
-What?

22:15.691 --> 22:16.863
Scrying pool.

22:18.113 --> 22:20.020
You're doing magic spells on your own?

22:22.871 --> 22:23.871
Felix,

22:24.082 --> 22:26.529
I still need three other
elements to do magic,

22:26.754 --> 22:27.754
remember?

22:28.066 --> 22:29.066
What about us?

22:29.465 --> 22:32.777
What about working together?
- Oh, I didn't mean for that to...

22:32.801 --> 22:35.593
- Didn't it occur to you?
What it would mean for me?

22:35.714 --> 22:37.568
- I'll help you find the other elements...
- Don't bother.

22:37.593 --> 22:39.848
It's clear I'm not that
important to you anyway. I get that.

22:39.872 --> 22:42.155
- No, I'm sorry, I... I
didn't think that...

22:42.465 --> 22:43.465
Oh!

22:48.910 --> 22:50.310
What are you singing?

22:51.324 --> 22:52.583
-Practice for the big night.

22:53.246 --> 22:54.964
Bremin Amateur Musical
Theater Society.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.542
-Yeah.

22:57.800 --> 22:58.965
Right. Good luck with that.

22:59.261 --> 23:01.224
-Trouble in paradise? A bit of a tiff?

23:01.464 --> 23:02.464
-It's nothing.

23:02.871 --> 23:03.871
-Eh, son.

23:04.456 --> 23:06.003
Take some advice from an expert.

23:06.327 --> 23:07.327
Sometimes with women,

23:07.788 --> 23:10.388
you gotta work to
keep the magic alive.

23:12.163 --> 23:13.230
-Sorry, dad, but

23:13.749 --> 23:15.335
you're giving me "The talk" now?

23:16.131 --> 23:17.131
I've got the internet.

23:18.665 --> 23:19.665
-Right. Yeah.

23:21.001 --> 23:22.268
Of course you have.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.990
Well, these pancakes aren't
gonna burn themselves.

23:36.608 --> 23:37.701
-It better be worth it.

23:49.049 --> 23:50.116
-Jennifer Bindies?

23:52.158 --> 23:54.158
Bare feet. That's just rigged.

24:13.876 --> 24:15.876
-This is yours for the taking.

24:17.431 --> 24:18.698
No need for magic.

24:21.725 --> 24:22.725
No tricks.

24:32.869 --> 24:35.180
- I am now ready for a
critical new experiment.

24:36.088 --> 24:37.542
With my control of magic,

24:38.447 --> 24:40.891
I can open a laurentian
transversable wormhole.

24:41.650 --> 24:46.183
Theoretical concept, which to science
has been impossible to create.

24:46.502 --> 24:47.502
Until now.

24:50.932 --> 24:52.755
Um... curious.

25:00.174 --> 25:01.841
Divinity of the elements,

25:02.150 --> 25:03.150
I summon thee.

25:04.104 --> 25:06.205
Through this world, we can see

25:06.869 --> 25:08.478
another place where we can be.

25:09.346 --> 25:11.665
Take the fire, make it bend,

25:12.236 --> 25:14.507
Take the air, make it turn,

25:15.071 --> 25:17.071
Take this water and this earth

25:18.361 --> 25:19.627
into another world,

25:20.525 --> 25:21.525
call us forth.

25:42.768 --> 25:43.768
I'm back!

25:50.081 --> 25:51.081
-Andy!

25:51.815 --> 25:54.548
What are you doing?
-I had to come back.

25:55.299 --> 25:57.634
Is that bad?
-It's insane!

25:57.658 --> 25:59.008
-I know, right?

25:59.229 --> 26:01.606
We are in the events of this
transversable wormhole.

26:02.307 --> 26:03.307
Smooth.

26:04.366 --> 26:08.579
-Don't let anyone see. You've got no idea
the chaos you guys caused last time.

26:08.869 --> 26:11.172
-Don't think you need to
worry about this bad boy.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.449
-You're still the
cutest kind of crazy.

26:33.988 --> 26:35.921
-Alright. I need one eyebrow.

26:36.457 --> 26:39.375
Where absence lies, let
nature grow as power flows.

26:46.783 --> 26:48.744
Oh! God!

26:51.806 --> 26:53.517
-What are you doing?
-I need your help.

26:54.095 --> 26:55.095
Please.

26:56.955 --> 26:58.659
-Oh, my God, Sam,
what have you done?

26:58.683 --> 27:00.683
-Please don't laugh; I'm a freak.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.767
-I think I've got something.

27:05.283 --> 27:06.283
-No!

27:06.525 --> 27:07.525
No way!

27:07.845 --> 27:08.868
-You want help or not?

27:13.355 --> 27:15.218
-Ah!
-Keep still!

27:17.183 --> 27:19.054
-I'd be done if anyone
saw me like this.

27:19.629 --> 27:21.230
My fans can't ever know about it.

27:21.254 --> 27:22.715
-Your fans?
-Uh-huh.

27:24.199 --> 27:26.144
-You're so full of
yourself these days, Sam.

27:26.793 --> 27:27.993
I hardly know you.

27:29.965 --> 27:32.938
You've got a choice, Sam Conte,
at the kind of guy you wanna be.

27:33.519 --> 27:36.719
Because right now, the guy
you are really sucks.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.559
Straight on to Instagram.

27:42.678 --> 27:43.878
Keep the tweezers.

27:53.037 --> 27:54.037
-This book...

27:55.811 --> 27:56.811
it's amazing.

27:59.170 --> 28:00.980
There's incredible power in here.

28:01.490 --> 28:03.427
-Just no clues as two who made it.

28:04.615 --> 28:06.168
-Who would leave this behind?

28:08.006 --> 28:09.496
-maybe the book will tell me!

28:37.600 --> 28:39.319
-What was it? What did you see?

28:40.139 --> 28:42.072
-Two kids holding each other

28:42.967 --> 28:43.967
in white.

28:44.584 --> 28:45.718
A sort of symbol.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.396
-I've never seen that before.

28:57.116 --> 28:58.185
-I saw something else.

28:58.983 --> 29:00.428
In the lair. A man.

29:01.303 --> 29:02.570
He made this place.

29:04.709 --> 29:07.709
-Who?
-it was so fast, I only got a glimpse.

29:12.279 --> 29:14.874
-Just never thought Felix
would be so selfish.

29:15.037 --> 29:17.082
-This is the most painful
mistake of all time.

29:17.224 --> 29:19.291
-Tell me about it! Andy's nuts.

29:20.896 --> 29:24.182
-Watch where you're going!
-Ew! Newbie.

29:24.677 --> 29:27.477
-She's barefoot.
-Probably home schooled.

29:28.675 --> 29:32.627
-So, what are you gonna do then?
-Avoid him until I graduate.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.065
-Weather alert.

29:38.047 --> 29:39.047
-Ugh...

29:40.430 --> 29:41.430
Thanks.

29:42.422 --> 29:46.125
-What gets me is if we had powers
there's no way we'd waste them.

29:46.383 --> 29:47.383
-Come with me.

29:48.196 --> 29:49.818
There's something I wanna try.

30:50.697 --> 30:51.697
-Where is it?

31:14.469 --> 31:15.637
-This means we're brothers.

31:16.047 --> 31:18.401
-I've never had a brother.
-Me either.

31:22.868 --> 31:24.334
-This is gonna be fun.

31:27.477 --> 31:28.610
-Arts and crafts?

31:28.805 --> 31:31.366
-This is how we find out which
element you have an affinity to.

31:31.930 --> 31:32.938
I think.

31:32.962 --> 31:35.408
-I could just ask Andy to help.
-No boys!

31:37.321 --> 31:39.254
Just hold your hands over the bowls.

31:39.444 --> 31:41.177
See if you feel something.

31:43.342 --> 31:46.868
-Om...
-Take it seriously!

31:46.959 --> 31:48.914
-I don't wanna be mud.
-It's earth!

31:49.076 --> 31:52.662
If it is your element, you might be able
to activate your magical potential!

31:57.155 --> 31:58.822
-You're at the wrong one.

31:59.968 --> 32:02.501
-And you are...?
-Try the empty bowl.

32:10.862 --> 32:13.638
-That's not supposed to happen.
-You're fire.

32:16.964 --> 32:20.498
-Whoa, I'm like a human microwave.

32:20.870 --> 32:22.137
-This is all wrong.

32:22.253 --> 32:24.123
Elemental powers
don't just happen.

32:24.253 --> 32:26.619
Not so easily.
-What makes you so sure?

32:26.690 --> 32:29.541
-Yeah, maybe we're just advanced.
I did skip a year of primary school.

32:29.565 --> 32:31.565
-And I'm definitely more
evolved than my brother.

32:32.620 --> 32:33.753
-How fun is this?

32:34.940 --> 32:35.940
-Who are you?

32:36.663 --> 32:37.663
-I'm Tegan.

32:44.999 --> 32:47.871
-My god, earthquake, earthquake!

32:48.171 --> 32:50.903
-What was that?
-You control earth?

32:50.991 --> 32:53.124
-Uh-huh. I'm just like you guys.

32:53.819 --> 32:55.545
-That means we're the four elements.

32:56.038 --> 32:57.553
Fire, water,

32:58.124 --> 32:59.124
air and earth.

32:59.202 --> 33:00.535
-So we can do magic?

33:01.210 --> 33:03.143
-I don't know.
-Sure we can.

33:03.702 --> 33:06.437
We just need to find
A Book of Shadows.

33:11.337 --> 33:13.431
-When you said you had a
plan, I was presuming that

33:13.456 --> 33:16.257
plan would involve a bit more
adventure and excitement.

33:17.009 --> 33:19.805
-The lair has to have been set
up by someone at school, right?

33:20.267 --> 33:21.401
A former student?

33:21.611 --> 33:22.678
-Oscar, Felix...

33:23.107 --> 33:25.794
This is a rare sighting.
Oh, excuse me, boys.

33:25.818 --> 33:28.034
A bit of a light weekend reading.

33:33.302 --> 33:34.369
-A teacher!

33:34.394 --> 33:36.561
-There's nothing magical
about Bates, keep looking.

33:39.982 --> 33:41.982
-Whoa, check it out, it's dad!

33:42.068 --> 33:43.283
With...hair.

33:43.466 --> 33:44.599
So much hair.

33:44.857 --> 33:46.806
And a vest.
-That's pretty much the safe vest.

33:46.830 --> 33:50.629
-Look, favorite subject: Music,
Physics, Woodwork and Cathy Connor.

33:50.654 --> 33:51.716
Mum! That's embarrassing.

33:51.741 --> 33:54.978
-Let me see that.Maybe  teenage
mom's in here somewhere, too.

33:55.091 --> 33:57.556
-Wait, what ... what
are we doing? Gotta focus.

33:59.711 --> 34:01.274
-He has to be here somewhere.

34:01.732 --> 34:02.732
-Let me try.

34:12.438 --> 34:13.438
-Feel anything?

34:14.384 --> 34:15.384
-Hungry

34:16.565 --> 34:17.565
-Yeah.

34:19.065 --> 34:21.911
-It's so cool having girl friends again.

34:22.253 --> 34:24.053
-Girl friends are the best.

34:24.416 --> 34:26.938
-Feels crazy...a whole crowd,
they go crazy.

34:27.042 --> 34:29.042
I did a 720....
-Who is that?

34:29.065 --> 34:32.069
-You're amazing.
-The vainest person in Bremin.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.726
I can't believe I went out with him.
-He was your boyfriend?

34:35.935 --> 34:37.068
-In another life.

34:38.826 --> 34:39.989
-Let's have some fun.

34:41.206 --> 34:43.201
Should you blow him a kiss?

34:58.000 --> 35:00.067
-Oh my, Comte. That was wicked.

35:02.321 --> 35:03.321
-Sweet prank.

35:04.407 --> 35:05.407
-Who did it?

35:05.954 --> 35:07.161
-Earthquake.

35:07.666 --> 35:09.666
-Came out of nowhere.
-Riles.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.742
-Gonna bring the pain.

35:18.864 --> 35:20.918
-You found the source
of the disturbance?

35:21.723 --> 35:24.057
-No, sorry, I'm just very ticklish.

35:24.364 --> 35:25.697
-It's getting worse.

35:25.817 --> 35:28.294
There's another disturbance.
-More of the darkness?

35:28.676 --> 35:29.676
-No.

35:32.005 --> 35:33.138
We know this one.

35:36.528 --> 35:38.429
My friend has crossed dimensions.

35:40.650 --> 35:41.650
-Andy.

35:41.986 --> 35:43.054
-You think it's connected?

35:43.635 --> 35:45.210
-His timing is more
than a coincidence.

35:45.463 --> 35:47.996
-Then he might know something.
-What?

35:48.540 --> 35:52.086
Well, order must be restored.

35:54.264 --> 35:56.639
-You know what helps not to get
trapped in negative space?

35:57.147 --> 35:58.147
-Candy Crush?

35:59.045 --> 36:00.312
-Thinking about you.

36:01.022 --> 36:02.756
Does that make you
feel uncomfortable?

36:03.280 --> 36:05.071
-No. Not at all.

36:05.811 --> 36:06.944
-I came back here

36:07.694 --> 36:08.694
for you.

36:13.203 --> 36:15.497
Oh no!
-You don't want to?

36:15.757 --> 36:18.283
-Yes...I mean...no.

36:18.687 --> 36:20.354
I mean...
-What is that?

36:20.367 --> 36:21.845
-Restoring demon! Run!
-Andy!

36:21.869 --> 36:23.171
-Hey!

36:23.562 --> 36:25.829
Sorry, I know I
shouldn't be here.

36:25.975 --> 36:28.626
but in terms of magical
disruptions, I'm pretty benign.

36:28.649 --> 36:31.739
-You know better than anyone that you
can't disrupt the natural order.

36:31.764 --> 36:33.418
Okay, starting to
freak out here!

36:33.443 --> 36:35.972
There's a darkness spreading
across the universe.

36:36.173 --> 36:37.173
Shadows.

36:37.345 --> 36:40.290
-What's that got to do with me?
-Bear thinks you can help.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.413
You sensed anything
strange in your world?

36:42.532 --> 36:44.360
-No...well...

36:45.095 --> 36:48.985
nothing more than usual.
-So there's been no magical disruptions?

36:49.368 --> 36:50.368
-Actually...

36:51.095 --> 36:52.695
now that you mention it,

36:52.899 --> 36:54.723
there was this one thing.

37:14.857 --> 37:15.990
-What?
-(laughs)

37:18.685 --> 37:19.885
-I'm sorry, Felix.

37:20.239 --> 37:23.228
My vision's so unpredictable.
-It's not your fault. We tried.

37:23.505 --> 37:25.438
-It's like it was right here.

37:25.462 --> 37:28.715
I could see a person
but their face was...blurred.

37:28.739 --> 37:31.519
-Maybe you're being
blocked by magic.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.214
-A thunderstorm, man, that was weird.

37:33.238 --> 37:36.020
-A heat wave?
It was like a climate change or something?

37:36.045 --> 37:37.816
-(Indistinct)
-What the?

37:37.847 --> 37:39.780
-I don't know...(indistinct).

37:40.637 --> 37:41.970
-The girls did this.

37:42.059 --> 37:44.771
-(indistinct).
-Who is that?

37:51.865 --> 37:54.198
-What did you find?
-The talisman.

37:54.451 --> 37:56.584
The boys found a powerful spell.

37:57.068 --> 37:58.927
They divided it.
-No!

37:59.630 --> 38:01.030
-What does that mean?

38:01.943 --> 38:04.010
-It means we must act. Quickly.

38:05.115 --> 38:07.020
-Come on, come on!

38:12.248 --> 38:13.248
-Who's that?

38:15.584 --> 38:16.584
-Jake?

38:18.130 --> 38:19.130
Why?

38:20.115 --> 38:22.435
-He's not the one.
-What one?

38:25.076 --> 38:26.076
-Wait...

38:26.443 --> 38:27.843
are you guys alright?

38:28.201 --> 38:29.201
-Yeah.

38:29.904 --> 38:31.304
Tegan's just so cool.

38:31.693 --> 38:33.760
-I know, right? She's the best.

38:34.208 --> 38:35.208
-Stop.

38:35.864 --> 38:36.931
We need to talk.

38:39.411 --> 38:40.411
-Scouts.

38:44.446 --> 38:46.729
-Don't look so desperate, Riles.
This is embarrassing.

38:46.798 --> 38:47.798
-Will!

38:48.806 --> 38:50.673
-Jake, I'm open! Give it up!

38:50.884 --> 38:53.573
-Merlon, pass it to Riles!

38:54.915 --> 38:55.915
Uh!

39:16.743 --> 39:18.676
-I was completely open, Jake.

39:20.032 --> 39:22.299
-I don’t know what happened. I...

39:24.235 --> 39:26.235
I never miss a shot like that.

39:35.895 --> 39:39.118
Tell me you didn't just do that.
-Payback hurts, doesn't it

39:39.142 --> 39:42.310
-Payback for what?
-You just can't handle my success.

39:42.887 --> 39:45.169
-You just ruined my life
because you think I'm jealous?

39:45.193 --> 39:46.432
-Of course you are.

39:46.457 --> 39:50.827
Of what? A bunch of primary school
kids that like your hairstyle? Loser.

39:51.037 --> 39:52.818
-It's like a documentary I
saw about elephant seals.

39:52.843 --> 39:54.326
-You guys, stop bickering.

39:54.927 --> 39:56.693
There's more important things happening.

39:57.091 --> 40:00.581
Did either of you made head to know why
the girls suddenly have elemental powers?

40:00.834 --> 40:03.355
And who's that new girl with them?
-With that girl?

40:05.357 --> 40:07.339
She's the one who said
you earthquaked me.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.382
-We've been played.

40:13.305 --> 40:14.305
Wait here.

40:15.797 --> 40:18.570
-That's the disturbance?
The little pharaoh blonde?

40:18.595 --> 40:19.649
-Tegan.

40:19.844 --> 40:20.844
She is free?

40:22.102 --> 40:23.102
-Who is she?

40:25.789 --> 40:27.722
-A problem only we can solve.

40:27.747 --> 40:31.346
-What do you mean?
-Go! We need restoring demons.

40:31.725 --> 40:34.325
-We have to tell Felix
what's going on.

40:34.819 --> 40:37.968
-Why does Felix care? He left you
to make your own magic, remember?

40:38.194 --> 40:40.194
-Why is it good enough
for them and not for us?

40:42.772 --> 40:44.410
-Hi, I'm Tegan.

40:45.210 --> 40:49.276
-I don't know what your story
is, Tegan, but we need to talk.

40:49.592 --> 40:51.404
-Oh, that's pretty. Can I look?

40:51.428 --> 40:52.487
-Don't touch that.

40:54.233 --> 40:55.233
-Manners.

40:56.420 --> 40:57.620
What's in the bag?

40:59.413 --> 41:02.639
I'm looking for a big,
old, dusty magic book.

41:03.569 --> 41:04.569
You seen it?

41:05.702 --> 41:06.702
-No.

41:07.327 --> 41:08.327
-I hate liars.

41:18.022 --> 41:19.088
-Storming demon.

41:19.678 --> 41:20.678
Take cover!

41:22.029 --> 41:23.563
-What took you so long?

41:26.253 --> 41:29.397
So predictable. Your tricks never change.

41:31.940 --> 41:36.570
[Incantation in foreign language.]

41:53.747 --> 41:56.684
-Andy where have you been?
-Guys, we have a problem!

41:56.739 --> 41:59.473
-You think?
-That's who I'm looking for.

42:08.368 --> 42:09.835
-Ellen, what do we do?

42:10.040 --> 42:12.269
-Since when did I
become the bug expert?

42:12.579 --> 42:13.579
-Entomologist.

42:17.056 --> 42:18.415
-I found something new.

42:18.938 --> 42:19.938
Wanna see?

42:21.829 --> 42:24.027
-Stop. This is not
your world to control.

42:24.051 --> 42:28.930
-Oh no? I'm just starting. Don't think
I've forgotten what you did to me.

42:29.263 --> 42:30.263
Or forgiven.

42:40.059 --> 42:42.059
-No, no. Someone needs to stay.

42:42.084 --> 42:44.703
-In this mess? Are we gonna
blitz this thing or not?

42:50.106 --> 42:51.773
-So annoying aren't they?

42:52.067 --> 42:54.000
-Stay back. What do you want?

42:55.020 --> 42:56.787
-What are you gonna do?

42:57.145 --> 42:58.145
Wash me?

42:59.903 --> 43:01.236
Cute friendship band.

43:02.044 --> 43:03.577
Friends in high places?

43:06.833 --> 43:08.899
You think you can play with me?

43:09.426 --> 43:10.426
Try.

43:10.755 --> 43:11.755
I like games.

43:12.591 --> 43:14.363
And I like to win.

43:16.419 --> 43:17.419
-Andy!

43:19.575 --> 43:21.775
Nice time to have
a shower, dude.

43:23.045 --> 43:25.493
-That girl...
-Tegan. She's trouble.

43:25.517 --> 43:27.888
-No Felix, she's worse than that.
-What do you mean?

43:28.576 --> 43:31.107
-Alice, Phoebe.

43:34.052 --> 43:35.252
-Are they alright?

43:36.177 --> 43:37.177
What happened?

43:37.513 --> 43:38.513
Are you okay?

43:39.583 --> 43:40.583
-Andy,

43:40.779 --> 43:43.067
what are you doing here?
-We need your help.

43:43.364 --> 43:45.067
In my world, that girl,

43:45.489 --> 43:46.623
it's total chaos.

43:46.833 --> 43:51.676
-Andy, I can't leave here.
-Really? That's a shame.

43:52.380 --> 43:53.380
Remember this?

43:54.700 --> 43:55.700
-Of course.

43:56.513 --> 43:57.846
Our friendship band.

43:58.419 --> 44:00.752
-You trust your
friends, don't you?

44:01.474 --> 44:02.674
That must be nice.

44:04.068 --> 44:07.087
I had someone I could trust once.
-Andy?

44:07.458 --> 44:12.953
-[Incantation in foreign language.]

44:17.200 --> 44:19.742
-The band.
-Isn't from negative space...

44:19.779 --> 44:23.665
so you can't control it. Tricky, huh?
-Why?

44:24.094 --> 44:26.373
-You thought you could just forget me?

44:26.398 --> 44:27.882
Forget who we are?

44:27.907 --> 44:30.754
-What are you doing? I need to
keep the alter verse in order.

44:31.161 --> 44:33.695
Without it, it'll be...
-Total chaos?

44:35.201 --> 44:40.128
You abandoned me for this world.
Now you're going to watch me tear it apart.

44:41.193 --> 44:43.383
order will not be restored.

44:44.654 --> 44:45.654
Not this time.

44:47.068 --> 44:49.324
-She's stronger than
anyone we've encountered.

44:49.701 --> 44:52.436
She controls all the elements
and the restoring demon.

44:52.748 --> 44:55.163
And she's coming for us.
-So what do we do, then?

44:55.615 --> 44:57.282
Some spell to banish her?

44:58.560 --> 44:59.560
-That symbol.

45:00.459 --> 45:01.459
-My vision!

45:01.764 --> 45:03.730
When I touched the
book, I saw this.

45:04.310 --> 45:07.303
-This was at the lay lines.
Right into the ground.

45:08.287 --> 45:10.670
Where we opened the book,
-And split the talisman.

45:11.412 --> 45:12.812
-Then Tegan turns up.

45:13.756 --> 45:14.756
What if...

45:15.115 --> 45:16.715
-...we brought her here?

45:16.795 --> 45:19.224
-We're doing that "finish each other's
sentence" thing again?

45:19.248 --> 45:21.248
-Um...
-But who is she?

45:22.568 --> 45:24.035
-I've read about this.

45:28.490 --> 45:29.490
Chaos sigil.

45:29.787 --> 45:32.187
"Against order is the force of chaos.

45:32.614 --> 45:34.309
The two exist in a balance.

45:34.724 --> 45:39.724
If Chaos separates from Order, the spirit
of destruction leads irreversibly..."

45:40.449 --> 45:43.718
-What are you gonna say something
cheerful, like the end of the world?

45:44.160 --> 45:45.427
-Not just this one.

45:45.988 --> 45:48.055
Every world in the multi-verse.

46:03.039 --> 46:04.484
if she wants this book,

46:04.844 --> 46:06.970
there must be something
in here she's afraid of.

46:07.797 --> 46:09.063
We need to find it.

46:10.203 --> 46:14.003
-Now that all four of us can
do magic, watch out, chaos.

46:17.932 --> 46:20.322
-Jake, where are you going?

46:22.721 --> 46:24.396
-My piece of the talisman's at home.

46:25.096 --> 46:26.846
If this is my last night on earth,

46:29.221 --> 46:30.541
I kind of want to see mum.

46:34.444 --> 46:37.236
-Okay. Let's meet at my place later.

46:51.899 --> 46:54.169
-(all together) Happy birthday, Tegan!

47:08.034 --> 47:11.105
-Again!
-Tegan, that's the third time.

47:11.206 --> 47:12.666
-I have a lot to make up for.

47:13.206 --> 47:14.806
-You're the best, Tegan.

47:15.144 --> 47:16.589
-We'll be friends forever.

47:17.183 --> 47:18.650
-What's with you guys?

47:18.673 --> 47:20.673
Snap out of it!
-Again!

47:21.159 --> 47:22.159
Wrap!

47:24.425 --> 47:27.864
Tonight, we play and stay up all night.

47:29.066 --> 47:30.199
Because tomorrow,

47:33.745 --> 47:35.121
Chaos rules.

47:39.922 --> 47:41.722
-Oh, I thought I heard you.

47:42.110 --> 47:44.177
So sorry about your game, Jake.

47:45.407 --> 47:46.407
Huh?

47:48.087 --> 47:49.350
Not the end of the world.

47:51.938 --> 47:52.938
-What if it is?

47:54.141 --> 47:55.141
-Ah, Jakey.

47:56.018 --> 47:58.133
Battles in life make us
strong, you know? You get

47:58.158 --> 48:00.146
knocked down you just
gotta get back up again.

48:00.190 --> 48:01.190
Right?

48:01.487 --> 48:02.955
-Even when you've got no chance?

48:03.815 --> 48:04.948
-Especially then.

48:07.198 --> 48:09.997
-The epic Bates meal is ready.

48:13.471 --> 48:14.471
I...

48:16.221 --> 48:17.399
I like seeing you smile.

48:18.776 --> 48:21.442
I'm happy for you, mum.
-Thanks, Jakey.

48:22.455 --> 48:23.726
It means the world to me.

48:29.401 --> 48:30.401
-Don't worry.

48:30.963 --> 48:32.230
I'll keep fighting.

48:33.174 --> 48:35.822
I gotta go, mum, I'll...explain later.
-Ok.

48:42.127 --> 48:43.744
-Hey, dudes!

48:45.354 --> 48:46.354
Finally!

48:49.083 --> 48:51.153
Where have you been? I've
been looking for you.

48:51.178 --> 48:53.178
-Getting take-away.
What's happening?

48:53.202 --> 48:56.009
-What's the story?
-No story. Nothing. I'm great, I'm fine.

48:56.181 --> 48:57.603
It's done.

48:59.260 --> 49:02.345
You guys know you're pretty much the
best brothers in the world, right?

49:03.416 --> 49:06.584
I...uh, I love you guys.

49:09.808 --> 49:12.303
-Whoa, alright. Yeah,
definitely something wrong.

49:12.329 --> 49:13.601
-Take his temperature.

49:14.691 --> 49:16.090
-I got some for you, too, man.

49:16.114 --> 49:17.571
-Yay, food.

49:23.425 --> 49:24.425
-Tuck in, man.

49:25.440 --> 49:26.440
-I'll...uh...

49:27.050 --> 49:29.269
see you guys later.
-What? hey! What do you mean?

49:29.292 --> 49:31.292
it's raining, jump in!
We'll drive you home.

49:31.316 --> 49:33.316
-It's okay. I'll see
you there then.

49:46.734 --> 49:47.892
-Are you crazy?

49:48.749 --> 49:50.016
What are you doing?

49:50.843 --> 49:53.076
-I had to see you.
-Andy...

49:53.655 --> 49:56.105
-Yeah. I really did.

49:57.937 --> 49:58.937
-Andy,

49:59.538 --> 50:00.937
what's wrong, are you okay?

50:01.937 --> 50:03.716
-Things are out of
control in my world.

50:04.694 --> 50:06.647
Like seriously.
-Andy...

50:07.827 --> 50:10.894
if anyone can handle out
of control craziness,

50:11.226 --> 50:12.226
it's you.

50:12.757 --> 50:14.844
-You think?
-I know.

50:19.577 --> 50:21.911
-Ellen, I shouldn't gave come back.

50:22.843 --> 50:24.768
I was too caught up
wanting to be near you.

50:27.193 --> 50:28.480
-Will I ever see you again?

50:29.443 --> 50:32.347
-My whole life up until this
point has been unpredictable.

50:33.060 --> 50:34.341
So I'll never say never.

50:35.810 --> 50:36.840
-Then neither will I.

50:45.645 --> 50:48.797
-Tons of cool spells, but
nothing with a chaos symbol.

50:53.848 --> 50:55.114
Dad, what?

50:55.317 --> 50:56.317
-Come on, boys.

50:56.700 --> 50:58.859
Get dressed.
-Tonight a star is born.

50:59.091 --> 51:00.824
My Bremin Musical Theater

51:00.997 --> 51:02.621
debut.
-Tonight?

51:03.145 --> 51:04.280
-Don't tell me you forgot.

51:05.427 --> 51:06.841
-We have an assignment due, mum.

51:06.966 --> 51:10.036
-No, boys, it can wait.
-It's a matter of life or death.

51:10.411 --> 51:12.777
Literally.
-Yeah, look, um...

51:13.777 --> 51:18.055
It's okay. Don't worry about it. We can't
shove guilt down an unwilling throat.

51:18.192 --> 51:20.742
-I'm very disappointed in you.
Both of you.

51:20.911 --> 51:21.911
-Sorry, mum.

51:24.294 --> 51:26.083
-One thing we can
thank Tegan for.

51:26.169 --> 51:28.816
-Mr. and Mrs. Ferne.
-Have got an assignment due, too, Andy?

51:33.645 --> 51:36.082
-Any luck so far?
-No, nothing.

51:36.419 --> 51:38.315
This power is so frustrating.

51:41.684 --> 51:42.684
Speak to me.

51:44.934 --> 51:46.401
-Maybe it already has.

51:46.888 --> 51:49.703
In your first vision, Oscar,
what exactly did you see?

51:54.020 --> 51:56.754
-The owner of the lair,
the Chaos symbol,

51:58.817 --> 52:00.951
a little boy and girl connected...

52:02.177 --> 52:03.643
-I remember something.

52:13.397 --> 52:14.397
Like this?

52:16.897 --> 52:18.230
Spell of Revelation.

52:18.835 --> 52:21.902
Reveal the secrets to
banish shadows to light.

52:22.796 --> 52:23.929
Sounds promising.

52:25.233 --> 52:26.384
-It's the best clue we have.

52:27.882 --> 52:29.368
It's the only clue we have.

52:33.584 --> 52:36.801
-We've fought demons,
we've closed dimensions,

52:36.944 --> 52:39.594
so of course we thought
we could save the world.

52:41.187 --> 52:43.354
But we didn't realize
that this was the end.

52:44.077 --> 52:45.077
For all of us.

52:48.460 --> 52:49.527
-Together again.

52:49.748 --> 52:51.724
Just remember...
-No, no inspirational speeches.

52:51.749 --> 52:55.089
-We've seen and done more than most
guys our age could ever dream of.

52:55.444 --> 52:58.421
The great powers aren't just a
gift, they're our responsibility.

52:58.726 --> 53:00.793
-Did you just quote Spider Man?
-It's Voltaire.

53:00.816 --> 53:05.814
-If Tegan is as dangerous as we think,
then, well, this is our town.

53:06.077 --> 53:07.077
Our home.

53:08.382 --> 53:09.382
Let's save it.

53:16.022 --> 53:17.974
-So inspiring.

53:19.905 --> 53:22.735
Don't you all look so tough
and ready for action?

53:22.749 --> 53:26.591
-You don't belong here, Tegan.
-Felix! Where's your hospitality?

53:30.749 --> 53:31.882
-Orders to Chaos,

53:32.335 --> 53:33.602
and Chaos to Order,

53:35.202 --> 53:36.402
the circle of life

53:36.929 --> 53:38.196
the endless border,

53:39.335 --> 53:42.341
- (all together) Reveal the secrets
to banish shadows to light.

53:42.640 --> 53:45.750
Open the door to cast
out the endless night.

53:48.796 --> 53:49.796
-Oh...

53:50.093 --> 53:54.750
-This is getting so familiar.
-Nice poem, very pretty.

53:55.077 --> 53:56.411
A round of applause.

53:59.218 --> 54:01.490
-Tegan, you'll hurt him!
-Obviously.

54:01.514 --> 54:05.152
-Don't be a spoil sport, Ellen.
He deserves it for what he did to you.

54:06.921 --> 54:08.673
-What happened?
Why didn't it work?

54:09.663 --> 54:11.130
-The separation spell.

54:11.327 --> 54:14.392
Now that we can do magic by
ourselves, we can't do it together.

54:14.585 --> 54:17.072
-Then the spell might still
work, if I try it alone.

54:17.096 --> 54:20.615
-Time to give up what isn't yours.
I want that book!

54:20.812 --> 54:22.278
-Then come and get it.

54:24.546 --> 54:25.813
-Mia, are you nuts?

54:26.437 --> 54:28.577
Can't you see that this
Tegan chick is trouble?

54:28.601 --> 54:30.923
-Oh, but you're so
good for me, Sam?

54:37.406 --> 54:39.124
Shame your fans didn't see that.

54:39.601 --> 54:41.668
-Stop. This can only get worse.

54:46.964 --> 54:49.964
-You boys have had your
own way for too long.

54:50.168 --> 54:52.599
You can't stand sharing
your powers, can you?

54:58.457 --> 55:00.705
-Ellen, please, I don't
want to hurt you.

55:01.714 --> 55:05.497
-You're so blinded by your arrogance
you can't see what you're up against.

55:07.097 --> 55:11.066
-Ellen, I'm on your side.
-I know. She wants the book.

55:11.090 --> 55:13.891
You'll have to give it to
her or she'll destroy you.

55:14.379 --> 55:18.495
-We can't. We need it to stop her.
-You are magic, you idiot!

55:37.211 --> 55:40.373
-No.
-Orders to Chaos, and Chaos to Order,

55:40.397 --> 55:42.989
the circle of life, the endless border,

55:43.625 --> 55:45.491
-You're not powerful enough.

Little fire element.

55:46.893 --> 55:49.209
-Reveal the secrets to

55:49.233 --> 55:52.097
Open the door to cast

55:59.445 --> 56:02.116
-Oh, the olden days. Haha.

56:03.652 --> 56:06.167
Want me to step through
your little trap door

56:06.191 --> 56:09.394
and get lost back in time?
Not likely.

56:14.206 --> 56:16.606
Wouldn't it be more
fun if I just...

56:20.927 --> 56:21.927
...crushed you?

56:21.973 --> 56:23.802
-I don't think that would
be fun at all, actually.

56:23.826 --> 56:25.826
-Leave him alone!

56:29.091 --> 56:31.834
-Sweet revenge, yo.
-Are you for real?

56:32.107 --> 56:33.507
That's just annoying.

56:33.818 --> 56:35.169
Game over, boys.

56:35.537 --> 56:39.728
Time to give me the book.
-Stop! You can have it.

56:40.091 --> 56:41.091
-Andy, no.

56:42.833 --> 56:45.033
Let us go, we'll
leave you alone.

56:50.168 --> 56:51.168
-Finally.

56:51.528 --> 56:53.229
-We need to get out of here.

57:03.439 --> 57:07.018
-You little creeps with
your little backyard magic!

57:08.760 --> 57:11.975
-What is it? What did they do?
-You let them trick me!

57:11.999 --> 57:15.272
You said you were my friends!
-We are, Tegan. Please calm down.

57:15.297 --> 57:18.144
-You're kind of scary.
-They can use the book against me.

57:18.155 --> 57:19.795
-Leave Mia and Viv.

57:20.046 --> 57:21.979
They're just slowing us down.

57:22.108 --> 57:23.908
We'll get them. Me and you.

57:24.460 --> 57:25.460
BFFs.

57:26.030 --> 57:28.143
-BFFs?

57:28.155 --> 57:30.297
-Best Friends Forever.

57:31.226 --> 57:33.633
-Yeah, BFFs.

57:37.319 --> 57:40.919
You wasted what I gave you.
Enjoy being normal again.

57:43.753 --> 57:44.886
It's just us now.

57:45.596 --> 57:46.596
BFFs.

57:47.362 --> 57:49.220
Now for those annoying boys.

[speaks magic incantation

58:39.176 --> 58:40.767
-Nice trick with the book, dude.

58:41.403 --> 58:43.403
-It was Ellen's idea.
-Ellen?

58:43.427 --> 58:46.090
She's not under Tegan's influence?
-She's pretending.

58:46.114 --> 58:48.840
-Then she's in danger!
-Hey, welcome to the club!

58:48.864 --> 58:50.979
-Wasn't that spell supposed
to take Tegan out?

58:51.043 --> 58:52.043
-I thought so.

58:52.348 --> 58:54.936
But it only opened a portal.
-To another universe.

58:55.074 --> 58:57.808

59:03.294 --> 59:05.094

had another win.

59:05.825 --> 59:08.292
-You could say that.
We got smashed.

59:08.653 --> 59:09.653
-Wait.

59:10.442 --> 59:11.442
Tegan is Chaos.

59:12.934 --> 59:16.835
-So we need ally ourselves with Order?
-We have to get back to Negative Space.

59:16.926 --> 59:19.429
To Bear.
-And get stuck there like you did?

59:19.497 --> 59:20.697
-Bear can help us.

59:20.989 --> 59:23.215
Tegan can't get the book

59:26.364 --> 59:29.083
-The girls...the best way to protect them

59:30.348 --> 59:31.887
is to KO Tegan.

59:35.561 --> 59:39.272

work unless we're completely separate.

-[Continues indistinctly]
-I don't know.

01:00:08.142 --> 01:00:11.156
-Suddenly, going into negative space
doesn't sound like such a bad idea.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.880
Um, guys...
-What is that?

01:00:17.904 --> 01:00:20.046
-A shadow. Use your fire.

01:00:20.881 --> 01:00:22.529
-Guys, hurry. It's closing!

01:00:24.624 --> 01:00:27.436
Guys! I hate being here!
This place freaks me out!

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:31.291
-Don't be scared in there, Sam. Negative
space is what you want it to be.

01:00:33.826 --> 01:00:34.826
-Dude!

01:00:35.896 --> 01:00:37.942
-I think we should worry
about ourselves right now.

01:00:37.975 --> 01:00:40.568
-I'm after you. Just look up.
Use your power.

01:00:47.712 --> 01:00:48.712
-Guys?

01:00:54.048 --> 01:00:55.048
Hello?

Phoebe?

Alice?

01:01:12.532 --> 01:01:13.532
Ben?

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.220
Come on, guys!

01:01:18.267 --> 01:01:19.267
Where are you?

01:01:21.353 --> 01:01:22.353
Where are you?

01:01:23.954 --> 01:01:24.954
Whoa...

01:01:36.016 --> 01:01:37.016
-Run!

01:01:39.766 --> 01:01:40.899
We're surrounded.

01:01:41.102 --> 01:01:42.943
-Through there! Let's
find a new way.

01:01:45.297 --> 01:01:47.455
-Well, here they are, Ellen.

01:01:48.672 --> 01:01:49.872
Your real friends.

01:01:50.321 --> 01:01:54.937
-Tegan, wait. We're BFFs, remember?
-Oh, yeah, remember this?

01:01:54.939 --> 01:01:56.440
BFF?

01:01:56.878 --> 01:01:58.505
-Ellen, I'm on your side.

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:00.747
-I know.
-I've been betrayed before.

01:02:01.107 --> 01:02:03.594
I swore I'd never let
it happen again.

01:02:03.701 --> 01:02:09.297
-Tegan, stop. It's us you want.
-Don't worry. You're next.

01:02:09.321 --> 01:02:13.749
-Stop! It's going up in flames,
unless you let her go!

01:02:14.707 --> 01:02:18.258
-Do it. Save me the effort.
-She wants it destroyed.

01:02:18.283 --> 01:02:22.988
-She went for another plane.
Felix, how are your footing skills?

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.572
-Don't let him go!

01:02:27.963 --> 01:02:30.296
I want that fool's Book of Shadows.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.690
-Whose book is it?
-Really? You don't know?

01:02:35.103 --> 01:02:36.103
-Jake!

01:02:38.447 --> 01:02:40.380
-That wasn't so hard, was it?

01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:41.897
-Can you get up?

01:02:41.931 --> 01:02:44.342
-Ugh, it's just...

01:02:44.366 --> 01:02:46.620
There's these. They suck my energy.

01:02:47.502 --> 01:02:48.502
-No!

01:02:49.994 --> 01:02:50.994
No!

01:03:05.102 --> 01:03:06.102
Come on!

01:03:07.493 --> 01:03:09.430
-They survive sun! Hurry.

01:03:14.514 --> 01:03:17.275
-The book is gone. He is gone.

01:03:18.264 --> 01:03:19.598
Nothing can stop me.

01:03:20.733 --> 01:03:23.858

I've fully seen what
Andy is thinking...

-Is there a solution to this?

01:05:03.089 --> 01:05:04.089
Okay, brain.

01:05:04.957 --> 01:05:07.451
Andy said that this place
is what you want it to be.

01:05:08.168 --> 01:05:09.301
What did he mean?

01:05:09.964 --> 01:05:13.031

Felix's stupid big fireballs would be
great right now. At least I could see.

little dude was all about.

-I'm a lot of things. But
okay isn't one of them.

had their driver's license?

01:06:42.533 --> 01:06:44.975
-Yep, Andy, that's exactly
what I'm thinking about.

01:06:44.999 --> 01:06:47.856
-It's affecting the whole town.
-Her power's increasing.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.625
There's nothing we can do about it.
-But there's still Sam.

01:06:52.077 --> 01:06:55.077
Uncle.
-She's destroyed the Book of Shadows.

01:06:55.101 --> 01:06:57.101

-Come on, guys. This
is the grand final.

01:07:02.412 --> 01:07:04.709
The fourth quarters only play
our best game. We have to

01:07:04.734 --> 01:07:06.896
dig deep if we're going to
smash it through the post.

01:07:07.467 --> 01:07:08.467
-Is he serious?

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.554

-Jake's right.

This is our chance to
do something good.

There's something in there.
You have to go back.

corner of this place

a thousand times. I
would have found it.

-Felix! When you did
that spell before,

01:08:30.091 --> 01:08:32.091
it created a portal to our dimension,

01:08:32.334 --> 01:08:33.934
but at a different time.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:37.837
So, what if what we're
looking for isn't here now?

01:08:38.162 --> 01:08:39.763
-But it was here before.

cast it in the wrong place!

Okay, you need to leave me for the
magic to work. Everyone out. Hurry.

-Thanks, dude.

Me and my brain have come
to a new understanding.

-We must hurry.

got to help us take care of Tegan.

-That's not possible.

negative space, Sam.

-We must repair our world
to keep the rest in order.

-But she's trying
to destroy Bremin.

will be the end of everything.

01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:40.824
Mr. Fern, is that your spell?

-A earth and nature one.

01:10:43.367 --> 01:10:45.678

spell thirty years ago,

-Well, I got straight A's in woodwork.

01:10:54.191 --> 01:10:55.526
But I got to warn you, boys.

01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:57.448
You use this spell

01:10:57.917 --> 01:10:59.851
and it comes at a high price.

01:11:00.034 --> 01:11:04.135
-I don't like the sound of that.
-Well, like all most powerful spells,

01:11:04.183 --> 01:11:06.116
this one demands a sacrifice.

01:11:06.464 --> 01:11:07.464
-A sacrifice?

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:10.050
-Your magic.

01:11:10.526 --> 01:11:11.926
Your elemental powers.

01:11:12.628 --> 01:11:13.628
Everything.

Forever.

-Everything?

01:11:18.534 --> 01:11:21.467
-Forever?
-That's why I gave up this place.

01:11:22.776 --> 01:11:25.087
And I hid my identity with
the last of my power.

01:11:25.885 --> 01:11:27.260
-That's why I couldn't see you.

01:11:27.932 --> 01:11:29.439
-I had to start all over again.

01:11:30.674 --> 01:11:33.807
Luckily I also had quite
the talent for retail.

01:11:38.526 --> 01:11:41.059
So, what are you gonna do?
-I'm in.

01:11:45.407 --> 01:11:46.407
-All of it?

01:11:46.954 --> 01:11:47.954
Forever?

01:11:51.383 --> 01:11:52.650
-It's the only way.

01:11:53.258 --> 01:11:54.258
-Ow.

01:11:59.004 --> 01:12:00.004
-Yes.

01:12:11.941 --> 01:12:13.474
-Looks like she's busy.

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:20.324
-Guess who's back!
Look who I brought.

01:12:20.348 --> 01:12:21.894
-Hi, guys!
-Phoebe!

01:12:22.027 --> 01:12:24.627
You made it!
-I know, right? How sick!

01:12:24.871 --> 01:12:25.871
What'd I miss?

-She's here!

01:12:33.606 --> 01:12:35.606
-You were right, dad.
-Of course I was.

01:12:42.447 --> 01:12:43.580
Do me proud, son.

01:12:49.212 --> 01:12:51.747
-She's opening up the
barriers between universes.

01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:53.470
-Tegan, stop!

01:12:53.868 --> 01:12:57.202
This world is our home!
-And now it's mine, too.

01:12:57.626 --> 01:12:59.524
So, I'm making some improvements.

01:12:59.853 --> 01:13:01.509
-There's only one
improvement to make.

01:13:02.376 --> 01:13:05.814
Getting rid of you.
-Well, look who's here.

01:13:06.657 --> 01:13:07.789
You got old.

01:13:08.664 --> 01:13:12.998
A nobody who has lost his powers
and has nothing to show for it.

01:13:13.297 --> 01:13:15.950
-I've got my family.
-Do you?

01:13:29.534 --> 01:13:30.534
-Mum?

01:13:36.112 --> 01:13:37.245
-What's happened?

01:13:44.932 --> 01:13:45.932
-Mum?

01:13:49.568 --> 01:13:51.983
-I don't think it's us hurting
them that's the issue.

01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:55.058
-Please, listen to me.

01:13:55.615 --> 01:13:56.615
Mum!

01:13:56.842 --> 01:13:58.628
It's me, Jake!
-Mum.

01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:02.850

We need to take her out.
-Yeah, and soon, or we're all captives.

-Let's crush this nutjob!

01:14:22.185 --> 01:14:23.993
-Remind me not to
make her angry.

01:14:31.093 --> 01:14:33.806
-The Kombi! hurry!
-What? We're gonna run them over?

01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:37.224

-Oh, my God!
-It's time.

Fun's over, Tegan.
-Oh, please.

01:14:59.818 --> 01:15:01.418
It's only just starting.

01:15:03.092 --> 01:15:04.092
-Got it?

Elements that we desire!

01:15:32.818 --> 01:15:36.925
Take this magic from inside
and use its power to chaos bind.

01:15:37.786 --> 01:15:40.425
-It should be working!
-What's wrong with our magic?

to find the talisman!

It's not fair.

01:16:14.564 --> 01:16:16.522
-You've worn out
your welcome,Tegan.

-Bear.

-You...

-When the universe was born,
chaos and order were the same.

01:17:10.867 --> 01:17:11.867
United.

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:17.376
I was the one who
broke us apart.

01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:20.350
I was the one who
betrayed my sister.

01:17:20.383 --> 01:17:24.130
To have my own identity.
Become the Guardian.

01:17:24.154 --> 01:17:26.154

Please don't leave.
-We'll be together.

01:17:32.094 --> 01:17:33.627
Chaos and order as one.

01:17:34.094 --> 01:17:36.160
How it always should have been.

01:17:36.773 --> 01:17:38.573
-What about negative space?

01:17:38.797 --> 01:17:39.864
The Multi-verse?

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:42.039
-The Multi-verse existed before me.

01:17:42.789 --> 01:17:44.322
And it will long after.

01:17:48.564 --> 01:17:50.764
-I thought we were
the Guardians.

01:17:50.775 --> 01:17:51.775
-Not anymore.

01:17:52.549 --> 01:17:53.682
Not without Bear.

01:17:54.127 --> 01:17:56.193
-So, we're free to return home?

01:17:56.853 --> 01:17:57.853
Forever?

01:17:58.877 --> 01:18:00.887
-Come, Tegan. Now we go home.

01:18:02.572 --> 01:18:03.705
-I've missed you.

01:18:04.353 --> 01:18:05.353
-Bear!

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:06.814
No!

01:18:24.682 --> 01:18:25.977
-So, um...

01:18:26.728 --> 01:18:27.862
that was intense.

01:18:28.135 --> 01:18:31.668
-Hey guys, I think you might
be forgetting something.

01:18:31.692 --> 01:18:33.692
-Where are we?
-What are we doing here?

- [ indistinct conversations]

01:18:36.052 --> 01:18:37.545

-Brian...

01:18:37.569 --> 01:18:39.569
-What's going on?

01:18:43.155 --> 01:18:44.155
-So...

01:18:44.975 --> 01:18:45.975
no more magic.

01:18:48.108 --> 01:18:49.108
-Just normal.

01:18:50.678 --> 01:18:51.912
Perfectly normal.

01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:57.850
-Group hug?

01:19:00.092 --> 01:19:01.670
-Yeah!

01:19:04.467 --> 01:19:07.334
-You've got to admit,
that's kind of sweet.

01:19:09.584 --> 01:19:10.802
-You're okay!

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.799
I've been looking for you.
The whole town went crazy.

01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:16.163
-We got it Sam.

01:19:20.912 --> 01:19:23.278
-So I guess you decided what
kind of guy you want to be.

01:19:24.131 --> 01:19:25.131
-Yeah, I did.

01:19:26.998 --> 01:19:28.465
-I want to be likable.

01:19:29.787 --> 01:19:31.170
-Who are you gonna be, Felix?

01:19:32.131 --> 01:19:33.131
-I don't know.

01:19:33.975 --> 01:19:37.301
Been into magic for so long,
forgot what I'm like without it.

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.207
I liked being a freak.

01:19:41.555 --> 01:19:43.836
-Daon't worry. We can
be freaks together.

01:19:45.289 --> 01:19:47.489
-As if you weirdos have a choice.

01:19:56.963 --> 01:19:58.816
-It will be good to be normal again.

01:19:59.698 --> 01:20:00.698
For a while.

01:20:02.174 --> 01:20:04.096
-You sell yourself short, Felix Fern.

01:20:04.862 --> 01:20:07.862
You don't need magic or
powers to be special.

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:09.913
You are already.

01:20:11.198 --> 01:20:13.557
And I for one, I'm a big fan.

01:20:25.827 --> 01:20:27.360
-The Nowhere Boys story,

01:20:27.631 --> 01:20:30.898
at least the magical power
of it, may have ended.

01:20:31.217 --> 01:20:35.064
They didn't know it at the time,
but they weren't the only ones.

01:20:35.678 --> 01:20:38.478
All around us, there are others like them.

01:20:38.522 --> 01:20:39.522
Like me,

01:20:40.491 --> 01:20:43.558
Who will soon discover
the powers within them,

01:20:44.624 --> 01:20:48.409
who will gonna follow Felix,
Sam, Jake and Andy's footsteps.

01:20:49.553 --> 01:20:51.153
This story isn't an end.
