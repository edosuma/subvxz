I tried to keep you on mode,

Your new evidence

- The fact that we even reconvened...
- Apologies, your Honor,

03:09.091 --> 03:12.528
on the true criminals
responsible... the Light.

03:12.596 --> 03:18.800

we have to offer is...

<i>I didn't say "run away".
I said "run".</i>

13:08.288 --> 13:12.239
Together, you and Impulse should
be able to negate the chrysalis

13:12.247 --> 13:14.162
by running counter
to its energy flow.

13:14.208 --> 13:17.352
<i>- Is it really that simple?</i>
- I wouldn't call it "simple".

13:17.408 --> 13:20.311
<i>You'll be attempting to siphon its power
with your own speed trails.</i>

13:20.379 --> 13:22.628
<i>It'll take a massive amount
of kinetic energy.</i>

It's definitely slowing,

13:58.576 --> 14:01.105
Even at our top speed,
I'm not certain the two of us

14:01.173 --> 14:02.874

kinetic energy.

14:02.942 --> 14:05.309
Then how about the 3 of us?

14:05.377 --> 14:09.680
I may not be as fast as you two, but
I can add my fair share of kinetic energy.

14:09.748 --> 14:13.449
Besides, I can't let the new kid take
all the credit for saving the world.

14:13.470 --> 14:15.796
- Good man.
- Go, crash!

14:16.238 --> 14:19.838
Come on, Wall-man,
you can do better than that.

14:26.150 --> 14:29.909

14:35.936 --> 14:37.870
<i>The Kid Flash is in danger.</i>

14:37.915 --> 14:41.737

14:51.556 --> 14:53.538
Uhh!

14:53.962 --> 14:55.893
Bart, we have
to slow down more.

of the energy attacking Wally.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.684
[grunts] It's no good, Barry.

15:03.723 --> 15:07.346
Oh, man! Artemis is so gonna
kill me for this.

15:07.455 --> 15:09.906
And don't even get me
started on mom and dad.

15:09.974 --> 15:12.976
- Kid...?
- Just tell them, OK?

15:13.536 --> 15:15.202
Kid!

15:24.555 --> 15:26.489
They did it! Ha!

15:27.825 --> 15:32.529
[both panting]

15:32.910 --> 15:35.765
- It's over!
- Congratulations. You have saved...

15:35.794 --> 15:38.601
Wait. Where's Wally?

15:38.669 --> 15:41.137
Artemis...

15:41.205 --> 15:43.306
He wanted me to tell you...

15:43.374 --> 15:45.208
No. No.

15:45.276 --> 15:46.810
He loved you.

15:46.878 --> 15:50.080
[sobbing]

16:13.005 --> 16:15.986
Are we... Too late?

16:30.250 --> 16:32.163
Aqualad, what happened here?

16:32.222 --> 16:35.357
Fear not.
The crisis has passed.

16:35.549 --> 16:39.018
<i>Though at a terrible cost.</i>

16:55.265 --> 16:58.965
<i>This is Cat Grant, reporting live
from the U.N.,</i>

16:58.983 --> 17:03.653
<i>where the entire planet Earth is
celebrating a special Independence Day,</i>

17:03.821 --> 17:09.510
<i>free of Reach invaders, thanks to
the brave heroes of the Justice League.</i>

17:10.715 --> 17:12.800
I told you I should
have been allowed

17:12.815 --> 17:16.214
to complete my research
into the scarab problem.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.632
<i>The Green Lanterns
escort the Reach</i>

17:23.657 --> 17:26.483
<i>to stand trial before
the Guardians of the Universe,</i>

17:26.530 --> 17:29.905
<i>thus completing your triumph
over those who sought to use you</i>

17:29.933 --> 17:31.374
<i>against your own world.</i>

17:31.421 --> 17:34.321
<i>It is over, Jaime Reyes.</i>

17:34.871 --> 17:40.349
<i>Sounds like someone's finally
listening to old G. Gordon,</i>

17:40.371 --> 17:42.626
<i>The lone voice of reason,</i>

17:42.665 --> 17:46.715
<i>calling for the ouster
of U.N. Secretary General Tseng</i>

17:46.758 --> 17:50.909
<i>after his disastrous
collaboration with the Reach.</i>

17:50.951 --> 17:56.426
<i>Well, guess what, folks.
Tseng finally resigned.</i>

17:56.493 --> 17:57.928
<i>You're welcome.</i>

17:57.970 --> 18:01.526
<i>Now, his successor
has not yet been chosen,</i>

18:01.578 --> 18:05.349
<i>but I think we all know
only one man qualifies.</i>

18:05.416 --> 18:11.652
<i>The man responsible for saving
all our lives from the Reach's MFD's,</i>

18:11.696 --> 18:14.898
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you</i>

18:14.926 --> 18:17.260
<i>Lex Luthor!</i>

18:17.313 --> 18:19.014
[cheering]

18:19.043 --> 18:21.978
You have got to be
kidding me.

18:22.233 --> 18:24.268
And on that note,

18:24.308 --> 18:27.919
I officially turn over
my chairmanship of the League to you.

18:27.949 --> 18:29.283
Wow.

18:29.303 --> 18:31.338
Thanks so much.

18:31.496 --> 18:33.996
This is no time
for you to resign.

18:34.132 --> 18:37.796
I'm not resigning,
just taking a leave of absence.

18:37.843 --> 18:41.653
Besides, if you need help, Barbara's
more than ready to step up.

18:41.740 --> 18:44.976
- Agreed. But, Dick...
- I need a break, Kaldur.

18:45.043 --> 18:48.979
You, me, Wally,
we founded this team.

18:49.055 --> 18:50.955
Without him...

18:51.049 --> 18:52.549
[sighs]

18:52.617 --> 18:54.617
I understand.

19:00.737 --> 19:04.937
- You look good.
- Really? 'Cause I feel like a fraud.

19:05.142 --> 19:09.342
Well, don't. You're honoring Wally's
memory by becoming Kid Flash.

19:09.413 --> 19:11.613
I know he'd be proud.

19:11.682 --> 19:13.202
Thanks.

19:13.283 --> 19:15.089
So, you suited up.

19:15.175 --> 19:19.075
- But as Tigress?
- Artemis was Wally's partner.

19:19.112 --> 19:22.122
I need some distance.
I need a change.

19:22.393 --> 19:24.918
So let's see how Tigress does.

19:24.974 --> 19:28.349
- As a hero?
- As a blonde.

19:28.432 --> 19:32.569
- Welcome to the Team, Virgil.
- Call me "Static".

19:32.600 --> 19:37.600
Catchy. So, what about your pals?
I take it they declined our invitation?

19:37.669 --> 19:40.439
Well, Arsenal was
always more of a solo act.

19:40.455 --> 19:42.540
And the others are
getting out of the gang.

19:42.555 --> 19:47.708
- Since when are Tim and Cassie a couple?
- Since Wally... You know.

19:47.903 --> 19:50.903
It was kind of
a "life is short" thing.

19:50.974 --> 19:54.174
It gave Cassie the courage
to kiss him.

19:54.277 --> 19:57.547
- Well, that kind of courage...
- Can be hard to come by.

19:57.668 --> 19:59.836
<i>Team, report
to the mission room.</i>

20:01.257 --> 20:05.490
Having stopped the Reach invasion
and broken the Light in half,

20:05.536 --> 20:08.368
the Team will now operate
out of the Watchtower,

20:08.404 --> 20:10.656
side by side with the League.

20:10.661 --> 20:13.029
Not because Mount Justice
was destroyed,

20:13.097 --> 20:15.332
but because you earned it.

20:15.704 --> 20:18.708
And so, we'll leave you to it.

20:23.142 --> 20:27.163
This Team has had successes,
but much remains to be done.

20:27.215 --> 20:30.516
Superboy, Miss Martian,
Beast Boy, you're Alpha.

20:30.539 --> 20:33.461
<i>B'arzz O'oomm has called from Mars.
He needs help.</i>

20:33.476 --> 20:37.279
<i>Tigress, Kid Flash, Bumblebee,
Guardian, you're Beta.</i>

20:37.357 --> 20:40.893
LexCorp is bringing out the Reach
soft drink under a new name.

20:40.961 --> 20:43.811
- We need proof.
- Business as usual.

20:43.824 --> 20:45.282
<i>The rest of you are Gamma</i>

20:45.299 --> 20:50.390
<i>and will investigate Batgirl's
lead on Vandal Savage's next move.</i>

21:07.354 --> 21:10.661
Business, as usual.
