00:03.897 --> 00:06.649
So, what do you say we kill
some evil sons of bitches?

00:16.412 --> 00:19.033
- Offering your soul?
- All you gotta do is bring Sam back.

00:19.623 --> 00:21.497
- How long did they give you?
- One year.

00:21.959 --> 00:24.629
You're gonna die,
and this is what you're gonna become.

00:24.796 --> 00:26.872
- I don't wanna go to hell.
- We'll save you.

00:27.048 --> 00:29.586
Back in 1835,
Samuel Colt made a gun.

00:30.677 --> 00:32.384
This gun can kill anything.

00:32.554 --> 00:33.966
Bela Talbot's her real name.

00:34.140 --> 00:36.298
Is she a hunter?
She's far from a hunter.

00:36.476 --> 00:39.263
The Colt. Bela stole the Colt.

00:39.437 --> 00:41.098
- I need your help. Sam.
- With what?

00:41.273 --> 00:44.523
You need to help me get him ready
to fight this war on his own.

00:52.744 --> 00:54.072
Rise and shine, Sammy.

00:54.245 --> 00:55.740
Dude. Asia?

00:55.914 --> 00:57.492
You love this song, and you know it.

00:57.667 --> 01:01.036
Yeah, and if I ever hear it again,
I'm gonna kill myself.

01:01.671 --> 01:03.081
What? I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

01:33.331 --> 01:34.956
Whenever you're ready, Dean.

01:39.297 --> 01:40.957
This yours?

01:42.216 --> 01:43.794
Ha!

01:44.177 --> 01:45.457
Ah.

01:45.636 --> 01:47.297
Bingo.

01:48.474 --> 01:51.143
Now, who's ready
for some breakfast?

01:52.102 --> 01:55.519
- Drive safely now, Mr. Pickett.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:55.690 --> 01:57.517
Order up.

02:00.236 --> 02:02.276
Can't stay
unless you order something, Cal.

02:02.447 --> 02:04.191
You know the rules.

02:04.450 --> 02:05.944
Some coffee.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.699
Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.

02:10.872 --> 02:13.032
Do you even know what that is?

02:13.794 --> 02:15.454
- Are you boys ready?
Yes.

02:15.629 --> 02:17.538
I'll have the special,
bacon and coffee.

02:17.965 --> 02:20.042
Make it two coffees
and a short stack.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.588
You got it.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.886
I'm telling you, Sam, this job is small fry.

02:25.056 --> 02:26.550
We should be hunting down Bela.

02:26.724 --> 02:28.765
Okay, sure, let's get on that.
Where is she again?

02:28.936 --> 02:31.937
- Shut up.
- I wanna find her as bad as you do.

02:32.106 --> 02:34.679
In the meantime, we have this.

02:34.858 --> 02:36.139
All right, so this professor...

02:36.318 --> 02:39.273
Dexter Hasselback was passing
through town when he vanished.

02:39.447 --> 02:40.823
Last known location?

02:40.991 --> 02:45.072
His daughter says he was on his way to
visit the Broward County Mystery Spot.

02:46.622 --> 02:49.540
" Where the laws of physics
have no meaning"?

02:50.793 --> 02:53.665
- Two coffees. Black...
- Thank you.

02:54.047 --> 02:55.672
- And some hot sauce for the...

02:55.841 --> 02:58.379
Oh! Whoops. Crap.

02:58.552 --> 03:00.260
Sorry.

03:00.679 --> 03:02.720
Clean up!

03:09.482 --> 03:12.055
Sam, you know joints like this
are only tourist traps, right?

03:12.234 --> 03:15.438
I mean, balls rolling uphill,
furniture nailed to the ceiling.

03:15.613 --> 03:17.190
The only danger is to your wallet.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.569
There are spots in the world
where holes open up, swallow people.

03:20.744 --> 03:22.653
The Bermuda Triangle,
the Oregon Vortex.

03:22.829 --> 03:25.915
- Broward County Mystery Spot?
- Sometimes these places are legit.

03:26.084 --> 03:28.622
So if it is legit... A big "as if. "
- What's the lore?

03:28.795 --> 03:30.586
- Well, the...
- Excuse me.

03:31.089 --> 03:32.915
The lore's freaking nuts, actually.

03:33.091 --> 03:35.250
These places,
magnetic fields are so strong...

03:35.427 --> 03:38.843
...that they can bend space-time,
sending victims no one knows where.

03:39.014 --> 03:40.259
<i>Sounds a little X- Files to me.</i>

03:40.432 --> 03:43.304
- I told you it wouldn't fit.
- What do you want, a Pulitzer?

03:43.478 --> 03:46.645
I'm not saying this is happening.
If it is, we gotta check it out.

03:46.815 --> 03:48.606
- See if we can do something.
- All right.

03:48.775 --> 03:51.979
We'll go tonight after they close,
get ourselves a nice, long look.

04:20.478 --> 04:22.304
Wow. Uncanny.

04:33.201 --> 04:34.363
Find anything?

04:35.495 --> 04:36.526
No.

04:37.038 --> 04:39.114
Do you have any idea
what you're looking for?

04:39.290 --> 04:41.580
Uh, yeah.

04:43.587 --> 04:44.618
No.

04:59.146 --> 05:00.689
What the hell are you doing here?

05:02.733 --> 05:05.190
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We can explain.

05:05.988 --> 05:09.439
- You robbing me?
- Nobody's robbing you. Calm down.

05:09.908 --> 05:12.695
- Don't move. Don't move.
- I'm just putting the gun down.

05:16.416 --> 05:17.661
Dean.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.160
Hey. Hey.

05:20.795 --> 05:22.753
- Call 911.
- L... I didn't mean to...

05:22.923 --> 05:24.501
Now!

05:25.843 --> 05:27.218
Hey. Hey.

05:27.386 --> 05:31.219
No, no, no.

05:31.391 --> 05:33.182
Not like this.

05:39.650 --> 05:41.228
Dean.

05:57.796 --> 05:59.539
Rise and shine, Sammy.

06:02.635 --> 06:05.173
Dude. Asia.

06:06.639 --> 06:07.670
Dean.

06:08.682 --> 06:11.601
Oh, come on. You love this song
and you know it.

06:33.210 --> 06:34.621
What?

06:36.172 --> 06:37.880
I don't know.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.294
You all right?

06:39.634 --> 06:41.378
No. I think I...

06:44.015 --> 06:46.553
Man, I had a weird dream.

06:46.726 --> 06:49.264
Yeah? Clowns or midgets?

06:51.772 --> 06:54.644
- Drive safely now, Mr. Pickett.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:55.444 --> 06:56.855
Order up.

06:59.031 --> 07:01.071
Can't stay
unless you order something, Cal.

07:01.242 --> 07:02.820
You know the rules.

07:03.828 --> 07:05.406
Coffee.

07:08.793 --> 07:12.126
Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.

07:13.589 --> 07:15.997
- It's Tuesday?
- Yeah.

07:16.885 --> 07:18.000
Are you boys ready?

07:18.178 --> 07:21.013
Yes. I'll have the special,
side of bacon and a coffee.

07:23.683 --> 07:25.262
Uh, nothing for me. Thanks.

07:25.436 --> 07:27.310
Let me know if you change your mind.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.475
I'm telling you, Sam,
this job is small fry.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.358
We should be spending our time
hunting down Bela.

07:36.740 --> 07:38.069
Hey.

07:38.242 --> 07:39.902
- You with me?
- What?

07:40.077 --> 07:42.071
You sure you feel okay?

07:42.956 --> 07:44.580
You don't...?

07:45.250 --> 07:47.242
You don't remember any of this?

07:47.419 --> 07:49.079
- Remember what?
- This.

07:49.254 --> 07:52.422
Today. Like...
Like it's happened before?

07:53.426 --> 07:55.917
- You mean, like déjà vu?
- No. I mean, like it's...

07:56.095 --> 07:57.887
Like it's really happened before.

07:58.056 --> 08:00.464
- Yeah. Like déjà vu.
- No. Forget about déjà vu.

08:00.642 --> 08:05.138
I'm asking you if it feels like
we're living yesterday all over again?

08:06.858 --> 08:10.441
- Okay, how is that not déjà...?
- Don't! Don't say it! Just don't...

08:10.820 --> 08:13.774
Coffee, black.
And some hot sauce for the...

08:13.948 --> 08:15.906
Oops! Crap. Oh!

08:18.496 --> 08:19.906
Thanks.

08:23.168 --> 08:24.448
Nice reflexes.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.717
Sam, I'm sorry but I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

08:39.895 --> 08:42.515
Okay, look.
Yesterday was Tuesday, right?

08:43.607 --> 08:45.018
But today is Tuesday too.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.898
Yeah. No. Good.
You're totally balanced.

08:48.071 --> 08:50.526
- So you don't believe me?
- Ha, ha.

08:50.699 --> 08:52.656
Excuse me.

08:55.537 --> 08:58.373
I'm saying that it's crazy, you know?
Even-for-us crazy.

08:58.541 --> 09:00.332
Dingo-ate-my-baby crazy.

09:00.501 --> 09:02.328
Maybe it was one
of your psychic premonitions.

09:02.503 --> 09:03.963
No. No way. Way too vivid.

09:04.131 --> 09:07.167
Okay, look. We were
at the Mystery Spot, and then...

09:07.342 --> 09:10.427
- And then what?
- Then I woke up.

09:10.595 --> 09:14.725
- I told you it wouldn't fit.
- What do you want, a Pulitzer?

09:15.893 --> 09:18.645
Wait a minute. The Mystery Spot.
You think maybe it...

09:18.813 --> 09:20.522
Maybe what?

09:21.191 --> 09:22.983
We gotta check that place out.

09:23.152 --> 09:25.643
- Look, just go with me on this, okay?
- All right, all right.

09:25.821 --> 09:28.063
We'll go tonight,
get ourselves a long look.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.281
Wait. What? No.

09:30.452 --> 09:32.658
- Why not?
- Uh...

09:32.829 --> 09:34.786
Let's just go now. Right now.

09:34.956 --> 09:36.700
Business hours. Nice and crowded.

09:37.877 --> 09:39.834
My God, you're a freak.

09:40.004 --> 09:43.918
- Dean...
- Okay. Whatever. We'll go now.

09:52.351 --> 09:53.514
Dean!

09:53.853 --> 09:58.562
Dean. No. No. No. Come on. Dean.

10:03.531 --> 10:05.689
Hey. Dean.

10:06.659 --> 10:08.118
Dean.

10:08.285 --> 10:09.365
Dean.

10:16.962 --> 10:18.872
Rise and shine, Sammy.

10:25.763 --> 10:28.801
Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.893
Would you listen to me, Dean?
Because I am flipping out.

10:32.813 --> 10:35.519
- Are you ready?
- He'll take the special, bacon, coffee.

10:35.692 --> 10:37.519
Nothing for me. Thanks.

10:37.694 --> 10:38.939
You got it.

10:39.821 --> 10:42.312
Sammy, I get all tingly
when you take control like that.

10:42.490 --> 10:43.867
Quit screwing around, Dean.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.032
Okay. Okay. I'm listening.

10:47.204 --> 10:49.742
So... So you think
that you're in some kind of a what...?

10:49.916 --> 10:50.948
Time loop.

10:51.877 --> 10:54.498
<i>- Like Groundhog Day.
- Yes. Exactly. Like Groundhog Day.</i>

10:54.671 --> 10:55.751
Uh-huh.

10:57.216 --> 10:59.755
- So you don't believe me?
- Ha, ha.

10:59.928 --> 11:02.929
It's a little crazy.
Even-for-us crazy. You know, like...

11:03.097 --> 11:04.260
Dingo-ate-my-baby crazy?

11:04.933 --> 11:08.883
- How'd you know I was gonna say that?
- You've said it before. That's my point.

11:09.355 --> 11:12.309
Coffee, black.
And some hot sauce for the...

11:12.483 --> 11:14.310
Whoops! Crap.

11:14.693 --> 11:15.726
Thanks.

11:21.076 --> 11:23.911
- Nice reflexes.
- No. I knew it was gonna happen.

11:26.332 --> 11:28.906
Okay, look. I'm sure
that there's some explanation...

11:29.085 --> 11:32.289
You have to go with me on this.
You have to. You owe me that much.

11:32.464 --> 11:34.872
- Calm down...
- Don't tell me to calm down. I can't.

11:35.050 --> 11:37.173
I can't, because...

11:37.678 --> 11:38.876
Because what?

11:40.139 --> 11:42.381
Because you die today, Dean.

11:43.768 --> 11:45.179
I'm not gonna die. Not today.

11:47.522 --> 11:51.188
Twice now, I've watched you die.

11:51.402 --> 11:52.433
And I can't.

11:54.655 --> 11:57.064
I won't do it again, okay?

11:58.535 --> 12:00.907
You're just gonna have to believe me.

12:02.331 --> 12:03.529
Please.

12:03.874 --> 12:05.535
All right.

12:06.169 --> 12:08.541
I still think you're nuts, but...

12:09.297 --> 12:12.084
Okay. Whatever this is,
we'll figure it out.

12:16.388 --> 12:17.669
Excuse me.

12:17.848 --> 12:19.342
I told you it wouldn't fit.

12:19.516 --> 12:22.009
What do you want, a Pulitzer?

12:22.187 --> 12:25.141
You think this cheesy tourist trap
has something to do with it?

12:25.315 --> 12:28.766
Maybe it's the real deal. Magnetic fields
bending space-time, whatever.

12:28.944 --> 12:32.230
<i>- Seems too X- Files for me.
- I don't know how else to explain it.</i>

12:32.406 --> 12:34.150
All right. All right.

12:34.325 --> 12:36.863
We'll go tonight,
get ourselves a nice, long look.

12:37.036 --> 12:38.531
No, no, no. We can't.

12:38.705 --> 12:40.164
Why not?

12:41.291 --> 12:43.083
Because you...

12:43.252 --> 12:44.794
I what?

12:46.714 --> 12:47.746
I die there?

12:48.925 --> 12:50.123
Blown away, actually.

12:51.636 --> 12:52.751
Huh.

12:54.765 --> 12:55.880
Okay. Let's go now.

12:59.812 --> 13:00.927
Get out of the way.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.066
What, did he...?

13:08.238 --> 13:09.436
Yesterday. Yeah.

13:11.075 --> 13:12.617
And?

13:12.785 --> 13:15.407
- And what?
- Did it look cool like in the movies?

13:17.290 --> 13:18.452
You peed yourself.

13:21.128 --> 13:22.408
Of course I peed myself.

13:23.631 --> 13:28.128
A man gets hit by a car, you think he
has control over his bladder? Come on.

13:33.058 --> 13:37.187
Boys, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

13:37.355 --> 13:39.893
We could use all the good ink
we can get.

13:40.066 --> 13:41.975
How long have you owned the place,
Mr. Carpiak?

13:42.151 --> 13:44.608
Well, my family's been guarding
the secrets here...

13:44.780 --> 13:48.113
...since you don't wanna know when.
- Anything strange happen?

13:48.283 --> 13:49.363
Strange?

13:49.535 --> 13:51.408
Strange happens here all the time.

13:51.912 --> 13:53.989
It's a mystery spot. Ha, ha.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.871
- What exactly does that mean?
- Well, uh...

13:58.211 --> 14:01.663
..." It's where the laws of physics
have no meaning. "

14:03.300 --> 14:04.925
Okay. Like how?

14:05.970 --> 14:07.797
Take the tour.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.975
The guy who went missing,
Dexter Hasselback, he take the tour?

14:12.144 --> 14:14.053
Uh, ha.

14:14.229 --> 14:17.813
- Hold on. What kind of article is this?
- Just answer the question.

14:17.984 --> 14:19.858
The police scoured
every inch of this place.

14:20.028 --> 14:22.732
They couldn't find that man.
I never seen him before.

14:23.614 --> 14:26.451
- We're a family establishment.
- Listen to me.

14:27.161 --> 14:30.861
There's something weird going on. Now,
do you know anything about it or not?

14:32.499 --> 14:34.410
Okay, look.

14:34.586 --> 14:36.294
Guys, um...

14:36.463 --> 14:37.661
...give me a break.

14:37.839 --> 14:41.504
I bought the joint at a foreclosure
auction last March, all right?

14:42.178 --> 14:44.254
Hell, I used to sell bail bonds.

14:48.476 --> 14:51.015
Okay, Kojak. Let's get some air.

14:57.861 --> 15:01.278
Hate to say it, but that place is
exactly what I thought. Full of crap.

15:01.449 --> 15:03.240
What is it? What is happening to us?

15:03.409 --> 15:04.607
I don't know.

15:04.786 --> 15:08.452
All right, let me just...
So every day, I die.

15:08.624 --> 15:09.822
Yeah.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.369
- That's when you wake up again, right?
- Yeah.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.290
So let's just make sure I don't die.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.833
If I make it to tomorrow, maybe the loop
stops and we can figure all this out.

15:20.137 --> 15:21.168
Do you think?

15:21.721 --> 15:23.596
It's worth a shot.

15:23.933 --> 15:28.180
I say we grab some takeout, head back
to the motel, lay low until midnight.

15:29.772 --> 15:32.976
All right, good. Who wants Chinese?

15:52.256 --> 15:54.083
Rise and shine, Sammy.

16:08.666 --> 16:13.044
I still think you're nuts,
but whatever this is, we'll figure it out.

16:13.713 --> 16:14.745
Thanks.

16:16.424 --> 16:18.998
So, uh...

16:20.470 --> 16:23.971
<i>...if you're stuck in Groundhog Day,
why?</i>

16:24.142 --> 16:25.766
What's behind it?

16:25.977 --> 16:29.013
First I thought it was the Mystery Spot.
Now I'm not so sure.

16:29.188 --> 16:30.304
What do we do?

16:31.150 --> 16:34.435
Well, we keep you breathing,
try to make it to tomorrow.

16:34.611 --> 16:37.648
- That's the only thing I can think of.
- Shouldn't be too hard.

16:37.824 --> 16:41.608
Yeah. I've watched you die a few times
now and I can't ever seem to stop it.

16:41.786 --> 16:44.242
Well, nothing's set in stone.

16:44.581 --> 16:46.705
You say I order the same thing
every day, right?

16:46.876 --> 16:48.785
Yeah. Pig in a poke, side of bacon.

16:50.212 --> 16:52.170
Excuse me, sweetheart.

16:52.339 --> 16:55.756
- Can I get sausage instead of bacon?
- Sure thing, hon.

16:56.595 --> 16:58.671
See? Different day already.

16:59.514 --> 17:02.302
You see, if you and I decide
that I am not gonna die...

17:03.019 --> 17:04.182
...I'm not gonna die.

17:08.733 --> 17:10.642
Thank you.

17:22.540 --> 17:26.040
Dean. Dean?

17:29.840 --> 17:32.047
You mean, we can't even go out
for breakfast?

17:32.218 --> 17:34.009
You'll thank me when it's Wednesday.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.049
Whatever that means.

17:44.315 --> 17:46.985
Do these tacos taste funny to you?

18:01.501 --> 18:05.499
Everybody's fine.
Nobody's gonna get hurt, okay?

18:05.672 --> 18:07.047
Sammy?

18:07.215 --> 18:09.968
You drop the ax
and let this guy go. What do you say?

18:10.136 --> 18:13.303
Something's gotta be going on here.
I intend to find out what.

18:13.598 --> 18:15.389
Place is tore up pretty good, dude.

18:16.225 --> 18:20.935
- Time to give it a rest.
- No! I'm gonna take it down to studs.

18:21.815 --> 18:25.684
Ha, ha. Sammy, that's enough.
Give me the ax.

18:25.862 --> 18:27.143
Leave it.
Give it.

18:27.322 --> 18:30.027
No, you give it.
Let... Let go! Come on...

18:30.200 --> 18:32.358
No, Dean. Leave it.
Come on...

18:32.535 --> 18:34.992
Dean? Oh, no.
- Aah!

18:37.667 --> 18:40.667
- Drive safely now, Mr. Pickett.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:40.836 --> 18:41.869
Order up.

18:42.047 --> 18:44.087
Can't stay
unless you order something, Cal.

18:44.258 --> 18:45.586
You know the rules.

18:45.884 --> 18:47.462
Coffee.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.511
Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.

18:57.689 --> 18:59.813
- What are those?
- The old man's.

19:01.735 --> 19:04.309
Trust me.
You don't want him behind the wheel.

19:05.114 --> 19:06.739
You boys ready?

19:06.908 --> 19:09.993
Yes, we are. Uh, I'll have the special,
a side of bacon and coffee.

19:10.162 --> 19:14.242
Hey, Doris. What I'd like is for you to log
in some more hours at the archery range.

19:14.917 --> 19:16.542
You're a terrible shot.

19:16.711 --> 19:18.419
- How do you know that?
- Lucky guess.

19:26.305 --> 19:28.630
Okay, so you think you're caught in
what again?

19:28.807 --> 19:29.922
Time loop.

19:31.269 --> 19:32.300
<i>Like Groundhog Day.</i>

19:32.645 --> 19:34.555
It doesn't matter.
There's no way to stop it.

19:34.731 --> 19:36.059
Jeez. Aren't you grumpy? Heh.

19:36.232 --> 19:38.770
- Yeah, I am. You wanna know why?
- Why?

19:38.943 --> 19:43.441
This is the hundredth Tuesday in a row
I've been through and it never stops.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.486
Ever. So yeah, I'm a little grumpy.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.246
Hot sauce.

19:50.415 --> 19:52.123
- What?
- Coffee, black.

19:52.918 --> 19:54.994
And some hot sauce for the...
Whoops! Oh!

19:55.170 --> 19:57.294
Crap. Thanks.

20:01.636 --> 20:03.712
- Nice reflexes.
- I knew it was gonna happen, Dean.

20:03.889 --> 20:06.345
- I know everything.
- You don't know everything.

20:06.517 --> 20:07.762
Yeah. I do.

20:08.352 --> 20:10.925
Yeah, right. Nice guess.

20:11.105 --> 20:12.185
It wasn't a guess.

20:12.357 --> 20:15.726
Right, you're a mind reader.
Cut it out, Sam. Sam.

20:16.570 --> 20:19.274
You think you're being funny,
but you're being really childish.

20:19.447 --> 20:21.026
Sam Winchester wears makeup.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.525
Sam Winchester
cries his way through sex.

20:23.703 --> 20:25.327
Sam keeps a ruler by the bed.

20:25.496 --> 20:27.868
Every morning, when he wakes up...
Okay. Enough.

20:28.709 --> 20:30.286
That's not all.

20:30.461 --> 20:31.575
Randy, the cashier?

20:33.797 --> 20:36.039
He's skimming from the register.

20:36.216 --> 20:37.961
Judge Meyers?

20:38.428 --> 20:40.551
At night,
he puts on a furry bunny outfit.

20:43.183 --> 20:44.593
Over there.

20:45.018 --> 20:46.762
That's Cal.

20:47.354 --> 20:50.439
- He's gonna rob Tony on the way home.
- What's your point?

20:50.608 --> 20:53.563
My point is I've lived through
every possible Tuesday.

20:53.737 --> 20:55.611
I've watched you die
every possible way.

20:55.781 --> 20:57.904
I have ripped apart the Mystery Spot,
burnt it...

20:58.075 --> 21:00.566
...tried everything I know
to save your life and I can't.

21:00.744 --> 21:03.781
No matter what I do, you die.

21:03.956 --> 21:05.581
And then I wake up.

21:05.750 --> 21:07.292
And then it's Tuesday again.

21:07.794 --> 21:08.873
The dog.

21:13.133 --> 21:14.676
There's gotta be some way
out of this.

21:14.843 --> 21:15.958
"Where's my dang keys?"

21:16.136 --> 21:18.463
Where's my dang keys?

21:18.640 --> 21:20.015
"Excuse me. "

21:20.183 --> 21:22.010
Excuse me.

21:22.811 --> 21:24.684
She's kind of cute. Heh.

21:26.106 --> 21:27.565
Hey.

21:28.067 --> 21:31.685
All the times we've walked down
this street, did I ever do this?

21:32.238 --> 21:34.314
Excuse me, miss?

21:34.616 --> 21:36.194
No.

21:43.585 --> 21:46.870
Hundred Tuesdays, you never check
what she was holding in her hands?

21:47.964 --> 21:50.087
This the guy who went missing?

21:52.094 --> 21:54.336
- Yeah.
- That's his daughter back there.

21:57.057 --> 21:58.433
Ma'am? Uh, miss?

22:05.150 --> 22:07.724
Hey, buddy. Somebody need a friend?

22:07.904 --> 22:09.232
Good boy... Aah!

22:15.620 --> 22:18.575
So the police report says
Dexter Hasselback is a professor...

22:18.749 --> 22:20.160
...but that's not all he is.

22:20.334 --> 22:22.457
- What is he?
- I talked to his daughter.

22:22.628 --> 22:27.505
The guy's quite the journalist.
Columns in magazines, a blog.

22:29.177 --> 22:33.258
He writes about tourist attractions:
Mystery spots, UFO crash sites.

22:33.432 --> 22:34.891
Gets his kicks debunking them.

22:35.059 --> 22:38.724
I mean, he's already put four
of these places out of business. Here.

22:40.857 --> 22:43.693
"Dexter Hassleback: Truth warrior"?

22:43.860 --> 22:46.897
- More like a pompous schmuck.
Yeah. Tell me about it.

22:47.072 --> 22:51.023
I've read everything the guy's written.
Must've weighed a ton, full of himself.

22:51.202 --> 22:53.658
When did you have time
to do all this research?

22:54.163 --> 22:55.658
Come on.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.918
What?
- Oh, just... It's funny, you know.

23:01.088 --> 23:04.006
This guy spends his whole life
crapping on mystery spots...

23:04.174 --> 23:06.168
...then he vanishes in one. It's poetic.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.254
Like just deserts.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.965
You're right. It is just deserts.

23:21.695 --> 23:23.273
What's wrong?

23:24.364 --> 23:26.737
Guy has maple syrup for the past
hundred Tuesdays.

23:26.909 --> 23:29.316
All of a sudden,
he's having strawberry?

23:30.538 --> 23:33.742
It's a free country.
Man can't choose his own syrup, huh?

23:33.917 --> 23:36.918
- What have we become?
- Not in this diner.

23:37.128 --> 23:38.244
Not today.

23:38.714 --> 23:40.956
Nothing in this place ever changes.

23:41.133 --> 23:42.758
Ever.

23:43.886 --> 23:45.629
Except me.

23:54.231 --> 23:56.141
Rise and shine, Sammy.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.572
So you think you're caught in
what again?

24:09.748 --> 24:11.457
Eat your breakfast.

24:23.181 --> 24:25.090
What's in the bag?

24:32.900 --> 24:34.477
Hey.

24:35.527 --> 24:37.153
- Hey.
- I know who you are.

24:37.322 --> 24:38.353
Or should I say what?

24:38.823 --> 24:40.365
Oh, God. Please, don't kill me.

24:40.533 --> 24:43.285
- Uh, Sam?
- It took me a long time, but I got it.

24:43.453 --> 24:45.446
- What?
- It's your m. o. That gave you away.

24:45.748 --> 24:48.535
Going after pompous jerks,
giving them their just deserts.

24:48.709 --> 24:52.244
- Your kind loves that, don't they?
- Yeah, sure. Okay.

24:52.422 --> 24:54.379
Just put the stake down.

24:54.549 --> 24:56.459
- Sam, maybe you should...
- No!

24:56.635 --> 24:58.793
There's only one powerful enough
to do what you're doing.

24:58.970 --> 25:01.759
Making reality out of nothing,
sticking people in time loops.

25:01.933 --> 25:04.175
In fact, you'd pretty much
have to be a god.

25:04.852 --> 25:06.311
You'd have to be a trickster.

25:06.479 --> 25:08.021
Mister, my name is Ed Coleman.

25:08.189 --> 25:11.559
My wife's name's Amelia.
I got two kids. I sell ad space.

25:11.735 --> 25:15.733
Don't lie to me! I know what you are.
We've killed one of your kind before.

25:20.996 --> 25:23.534
Actually, bucko, you didn't.

25:32.507 --> 25:34.667
Why are you doing this?

25:35.261 --> 25:38.713
You're joking, right? You chuckleheads
tried to kill me last time.

25:39.265 --> 25:40.925
Why wouldn't I do this?

25:41.100 --> 25:42.560
Hasselback. What about him?

25:43.604 --> 25:44.719
That putz?

25:45.773 --> 25:49.391
He said he didn't believe in wormholes,
so I dropped him in one.

25:50.110 --> 25:52.781
Ha-ha-ha! Huh?

25:52.989 --> 25:54.982
Then you guys showed up.

25:55.158 --> 25:57.614
I made you the second you hit town.

25:57.786 --> 25:59.696
So this is fun for you?

25:59.872 --> 26:02.624
Killing Dean over and over again?

26:02.792 --> 26:05.034
One: Yes, it is fun.

26:05.503 --> 26:06.914
And two:

26:07.088 --> 26:09.662
This is so not about killing Dean.

26:11.593 --> 26:14.511
This joke is on you, Sam.

26:15.430 --> 26:18.183
Watching your brother die every day.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.848
Forever.

26:22.021 --> 26:23.397
You son of a bitch.

26:24.567 --> 26:27.521
How long will it take you to realize...

26:27.695 --> 26:30.186
...you can't save your brother...

26:31.490 --> 26:33.151
...no matter what?

26:33.577 --> 26:35.237
Oh, yeah?

26:35.537 --> 26:37.079
I kill you, this all ends now.

26:37.247 --> 26:38.658
Uh, Oh, hey. Whoa.

26:38.832 --> 26:41.205
Okay. Okay. Look.

26:41.377 --> 26:43.002
I was just playing around.

26:43.171 --> 26:44.629
You can't take a joke? Fine.

26:44.797 --> 26:48.166
You're out of it. Tomorrow,
you wake up, it'll be Wednesday.

26:49.219 --> 26:51.426
- I swear.
- You're lying.

26:51.889 --> 26:54.462
If I am, you know where to find me.

26:54.641 --> 26:56.301
Having pancakes at the diner.

27:01.483 --> 27:03.475
No. Easier to just kill you.

27:03.652 --> 27:05.776
Sorry, kiddo. Can't have that.

27:15.540 --> 27:16.951
Were you gonna sleep all day?

27:17.125 --> 27:19.877
- No Asia.
- Yeah, I know. This station sucks.

27:23.424 --> 27:25.084
It's Wednesday.

27:25.718 --> 27:29.170
Yeah, which usually comes after
Tuesday. Turn that thing off, would you?

27:29.347 --> 27:30.427
What, are you kidding?

27:30.599 --> 27:33.221
This isn't the most beautiful song
you've ever heard?

27:33.394 --> 27:34.508
No.

27:34.687 --> 27:36.893
Jeez. How many Tuesdays
did you have?

27:37.064 --> 27:38.892
I don't know. I lost count.

27:39.818 --> 27:42.107
Hey, wait. What do you remember?

27:42.279 --> 27:46.277
I remember you were wacked out of it
yesterday, running into the trickster.

27:46.617 --> 27:48.657
- But no, that's about it.
- All right.

27:48.828 --> 27:50.904
Pack your stuff.
Let's get out of town. Now.

27:52.081 --> 27:54.538
- No breakfast?
- No breakfast.

28:04.054 --> 28:07.138
Are you sure
we should just let the trickster go?

28:08.850 --> 28:09.881
Give me your wallet.

28:10.602 --> 28:12.560
Whoa, whoa, buddy. Just relax.

28:12.980 --> 28:14.391
I am relaxed.

28:14.565 --> 28:17.649
Okay. All right. Nobody wants this
to end the wrong way.

28:17.818 --> 28:19.812
Let's talk about it a sec.

28:26.203 --> 28:27.947
Dean!

28:36.298 --> 28:38.006
No. No, no, no.

28:38.175 --> 28:41.295
Hey. Hey. Come on.
Not today. Not today.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.674
This isn't supposed to happen today.
Come on.

28:55.111 --> 28:57.353
I'm supposed to wake up.

29:21.723 --> 29:23.929
<i>It's Sam. Leave me a message.</i>

29:24.100 --> 29:26.139
<i>Sam, it's Bobby.</i>

29:26.312 --> 29:29.147
<i>Heard about that demon
you took care of in Death Valley.</i>

29:29.315 --> 29:31.141
<i>Nice job.</i>

29:31.317 --> 29:33.439
<i>It's been three months
we talked, though.</i>

29:33.611 --> 29:35.734
<i>It'd be nice to hear your voice.</i>

29:35.906 --> 29:38.990
<i>Give a call. I'm here.</i>

30:14.740 --> 30:17.030
<i>Sam? Bobby again.</i>

30:17.202 --> 30:20.119
<i>Look, I'm worried about you.</i>

30:20.288 --> 30:22.661
<i>Just tell me you're not sitting alone
somewhere...</i>

30:22.833 --> 30:25.751
<i>...obsessing over this damn trickster.</i>

30:25.920 --> 30:26.999
<i>Call me, Sam.</i>

30:27.171 --> 30:28.915
<i>We can find it together.</i>

30:29.090 --> 30:31.795
<i>No one man should take
something like this on alone.</i>

30:31.968 --> 30:33.712
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

30:33.887 --> 30:38.384
<i>By the way, that vampire nest
in Austin, hell of a job.</i>

30:54.869 --> 30:57.242
<i>Sam? It's Bobby.</i>

30:57.414 --> 30:59.241
<i>I found him.</i>

31:14.266 --> 31:16.010
It's good to see you, boy.

31:21.775 --> 31:22.973
What are we doing here?

31:23.151 --> 31:26.105
This is the last place
the trickster worked his magic.

31:26.279 --> 31:29.197
- So?
- So you want this thing?

31:29.366 --> 31:32.237
I found a summoning ritual
to bring the trickster here.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.954
What do we need?

31:36.374 --> 31:37.405
Blood.

31:38.752 --> 31:42.702
- How much blood?
- Ritual says near a gallon.

31:42.881 --> 31:45.337
And it's gotta be fresh too.

31:46.553 --> 31:48.841
Meaning we have to
bleed a person dry.

31:49.013 --> 31:53.391
And it's gotta be tonight,
or not for another 50 years.

31:54.060 --> 31:56.220
Then let's go get some.

32:02.194 --> 32:04.318
You break my heart, kid.

32:05.991 --> 32:07.070
What?

32:08.243 --> 32:11.114
I'm not gonna let you murder
an innocent man.

32:11.289 --> 32:12.913
Then why did you bring me here?

32:13.082 --> 32:14.411
Why?

32:14.584 --> 32:16.541
Because it was the only way
you'd see me.

32:16.711 --> 32:19.249
Because I'm trying to knock
some sense into you.

32:19.423 --> 32:22.175
Because I thought you'd back down
from killing a man.

32:22.343 --> 32:24.051
Well, you thought wrong.

32:25.971 --> 32:27.764
Leave the stuff. I'll do it myself.

32:27.933 --> 32:29.759
I told you,
I'm not gonna let you kill anyone.

32:29.935 --> 32:32.011
It's none of your damn business
what I do!

32:37.401 --> 32:40.189
You want your brother back so bad...

32:49.289 --> 32:50.618
...fine.

32:51.875 --> 32:55.292
- What are you talking about?
- Better me than a civilian.

32:59.217 --> 33:01.674
You're crazy, Bobby.
I'm not killing you.

33:01.846 --> 33:04.467
Oh. Now I'm the crazy one.

33:07.226 --> 33:09.267
Look, Sam.

33:10.397 --> 33:13.600
I'm old.
I'm coming near the end of my trail.

33:14.484 --> 33:18.353
But you can keep fighting,
saving folks.

33:19.073 --> 33:21.564
But you need your brother.

33:22.535 --> 33:25.156
So let me give him back to you.

33:25.706 --> 33:28.458
- Bobby...
- You and Dean, you...

33:29.209 --> 33:32.495
You boys are the closest thing
I have to family.

33:35.425 --> 33:37.750
I wanna do this.

33:43.559 --> 33:45.137
Okay.

33:45.311 --> 33:46.722
Good.

33:59.452 --> 34:00.946
Just make it quick.

34:05.208 --> 34:06.952
Do it, son.

34:07.127 --> 34:09.583
Yeah, okay, Bobby.

34:12.174 --> 34:14.416
But you wanna know why?

34:19.099 --> 34:21.471
Because you're not Bobby.

34:33.449 --> 34:35.072
Bobby?

34:37.244 --> 34:38.869
Bobby.

34:41.331 --> 34:42.495
Bobby!

34:52.053 --> 34:54.922
You're right.
I was just screwing with you.

34:55.097 --> 34:56.676
Pretty good, though, Sam.

34:56.850 --> 34:57.965
Smart.

34:58.894 --> 35:02.974
Let me tell you. Whoever said Dean
was the dysfunctional one...

35:03.148 --> 35:05.770
...has never seen you
with a sharp object in your hands.

35:05.944 --> 35:08.980
<i>Ha, ha. Holy Full Metal Jacket.</i>

35:09.864 --> 35:10.943
Bring him back.

35:12.743 --> 35:13.774
Who, Dean?

35:16.539 --> 35:18.330
Didn't my girl send you the flowers?

35:18.499 --> 35:19.697
Dean's dead.

35:19.875 --> 35:21.620
He ain't coming back.

35:21.795 --> 35:25.378
His soul's downstairs
doing the hellfire rumba as we speak.

35:25.549 --> 35:27.458
Just take us back to that Tuesday.

35:27.634 --> 35:31.253
Or Wednesday,
when it all started, please.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.838
We won't come after you. I swear.

35:34.016 --> 35:36.139
- You swear?
- Yes.

35:36.435 --> 35:38.809
I don't know.

35:39.148 --> 35:40.939
- Even if I could...
- You can.

35:41.108 --> 35:42.270
True.

35:42.443 --> 35:43.985
But that don't mean I should.

35:45.530 --> 35:46.645
Sam...

35:47.407 --> 35:48.735
...there's a lesson here...

35:48.908 --> 35:53.321
...that I've been trying to drill into that
freakish, Cro-Magnon skull of yours.

35:53.496 --> 35:55.406
Lesson?

35:55.958 --> 35:56.989
What lesson?

35:57.168 --> 36:00.085
This obsession to save Dean?

36:00.629 --> 36:04.249
The way you two keep sacrificing
yourselves for each other?

36:04.968 --> 36:07.542
Nothing good comes out of it.

36:07.721 --> 36:09.512
Just blood and pain.

36:12.935 --> 36:15.177
Dean's your weakness.

36:16.022 --> 36:18.429
The bad guys know it too.

36:20.361 --> 36:22.104
He's gonna be the death of you, Sam.

36:25.824 --> 36:29.693
Sometimes
you just gotta let people go.

36:30.664 --> 36:32.122
He's my brother.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.582
Yup.

36:35.169 --> 36:37.209
And like it or not...

36:37.880 --> 36:40.205
...this is what life's gonna be like
without him.

36:40.383 --> 36:41.960
Please.

36:42.385 --> 36:43.500
Just...

36:47.057 --> 36:48.599
Please.

36:51.353 --> 36:54.805
I swear,
it's like talking to a brick wall.

36:58.236 --> 36:59.516
Okay, look.

36:59.697 --> 37:02.484
This all stopped being fun
months ago.

37:02.658 --> 37:04.615
You're Travis Bickle in a skirt, pal.

37:04.785 --> 37:05.864
I'm over it.

37:06.370 --> 37:09.538
- Meaning what?
- Meaning, that's for me to know...

37:09.708 --> 37:11.535
...and you to find out.

37:24.390 --> 37:25.802
Were you gonna sleep all day?

37:27.185 --> 37:30.020
I know. No Asia. This station sucks.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.279
It's Wednesday.

37:37.446 --> 37:41.230
Yeah. Which usually follows Tuesday.
Turn that thing off.

37:51.254 --> 37:53.128
Dude, how many Tuesdays
did you have?

37:53.298 --> 37:55.041
Enough.

37:56.092 --> 37:57.634
Wait.

37:58.929 --> 38:00.637
What do you remember?

38:01.807 --> 38:04.512
I remember you were pretty
wacked out yesterday.

38:04.685 --> 38:06.560
I remember
catching up with the trickster.

38:07.147 --> 38:08.392
That's about it.

38:12.194 --> 38:14.021
- Let's go.
- No breakfast?

38:15.490 --> 38:16.604
No breakfast.

38:17.450 --> 38:20.534
- I'll pack the car.
- Wait. You're not going anywhere alone.

38:20.703 --> 38:23.242
- It's the parking lot, Sam.
- Just...

38:24.667 --> 38:26.244
Just trust me.

38:33.093 --> 38:35.963
Hey, you don't look so good.
Something else happen?

38:39.100 --> 38:41.769
I just had a really weird dream.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.468
Clowns or midgets?
