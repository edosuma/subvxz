WEBVTT

00:17.118 --> 00:17.685
Hell yeah!

00:17.718 --> 00:18.519
I win again.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.553
No way. Sweeney,

00:19.587 --> 00:21.222
you a sandbagging son of a...

00:21.255 --> 00:22.323
I'm not paying.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.624
Yeah, are we sure it
even hit the target?

00:23.657 --> 00:26.194
Oh, it hit the target, Cooper.
Pay up.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.395
Ah, you must've messed
with our sights, man.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.363
Sure, the sights-- yeah,
that's the problem.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.133
Hey, how about
double or nothing?

00:32.166 --> 00:34.368
You want to give me
all your money, that's fine.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.603
Oh...

00:49.883 --> 00:52.186
DALE: Well,
well, well.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.255
Looks like you're not such a
hotshot after all, huh, Sweeney?

00:55.456 --> 00:57.225
Sweeney.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.260
Sweeney!

01:00.794 --> 01:03.063
*

01:34.495 --> 01:37.131
How did I never
know this?

01:37.165 --> 01:39.467
I'm telling you, the elevator
close-door button is a placebo.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.202
Same with crosswalks.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.671
Wha... So, we've just
been pushing it

01:43.704 --> 01:45.306
all these years
for no reason?

01:45.339 --> 01:48.276
Yeah, it's crazy, especially
when recent studies show

01:48.309 --> 01:50.611
that levels of bacteria
on elevator buttons

01:50.644 --> 01:53.281
can be 40 times higher
than on public toilet seats.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.385
You okay, Nick?

01:57.418 --> 02:00.221
McGEE:
Nick?
Huh? Hey, guys.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.390
Everything all right?
No!

02:02.423 --> 02:04.458
You want to
talk about it?

02:04.492 --> 02:06.260
I got a letter
from the IRS.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.262
They want my leave
and earning statements

02:08.296 --> 02:09.863
from when I was undercover
in South America.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.300
I mean, who keeps
an LES from five years ago?

02:12.333 --> 02:13.734
I do.
I do.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.769
REEVES:
I once had a friend
at MI6 whose taxes

02:15.803 --> 02:18.372
got messed up when he was
undercover in Borneo.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.608
Took him years to pay off.
How'd that happen?

02:20.641 --> 02:23.444
He tried to write off
a helicopter as his company car.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.547
Palmer finished the body
that came in last night.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.316
I'll be down in Autopsy.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.218
Well, I thought Spain
said he had heart failure.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.519
They did.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.189
Do any of you do
your own taxes?

02:36.490 --> 02:39.159
Palmer.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.964
Duck.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.433
Well, good morning.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.301
Good morning, Jethro.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.270
No doubt you're
wondering why I'm here.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.838
Well, I don't know.
Maybe you missed us?

02:50.871 --> 02:52.640
Well, true as
that sentiment

02:52.673 --> 02:54.308
may be,

02:54.342 --> 02:55.843
the university is
on spring break,

02:55.876 --> 02:58.312
and I'm here in town
to handle the second

02:58.346 --> 03:00.648
of life's two certainties.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.816
And when Dr. Mallard stopped
by this morning, I invited him

03:02.850 --> 03:03.984
to have a go
at the first.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.986
Yeah, death and taxes, Jethro.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.656
What do you got, Jimmy?
Well,

03:08.689 --> 03:12.560
Petty Officer Sweeney definitely
died of a cardiac arrest.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.296
But the real question is why.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.331
23 years old,
active-duty sailor.

03:17.365 --> 03:20.734
He just had a physical
last December, Gibbs.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.536
He passed with
flying colors.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.572
DUCKY: Not exactly
the ideal candidate

03:24.605 --> 03:25.906
for heart failure.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.409
Maybe he had help.

03:28.442 --> 03:31.345
Perhaps, but we haven't
been able to find anything.

03:31.379 --> 03:34.915
Most certainly no puncture
wounds that would indicate

03:34.948 --> 03:37.585
the injection
of a toxin.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.887
I sent blood samples and his
stomach contents up to Abby.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.689
Yeah, maybe
she can find the answer.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.757
Keep me updated?
Mm-hmm.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.960
Hey, Duck, maybe stop by
for a little bourbon

03:46.994 --> 03:48.629
before you head out of town?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.498
I'll bring some Scotch!

03:55.503 --> 03:57.405
Hey, Abby.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.639
What do you got?

03:58.672 --> 04:01.442
McGee, buckle up,
'cause I got a lot.

04:01.475 --> 04:06.514
So I found cyanide in Petty
Officer Sweeney's blood.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.317
How do you think it
got in his system?
That's a good question,

04:09.350 --> 04:11.285
and the answer is tragically.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.986
Death by cookies.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.888
Cookies?

04:14.922 --> 04:19.827
Yeah, frosted almond cookies
with little almond bits

04:19.860 --> 04:21.995
and some poison mixed in.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.964
Where did he get
poisoned cookies?

04:23.997 --> 04:27.368
I called Spain, and they said
there is nothing close

04:27.401 --> 04:30.371
to a frosted almond cookie
on their whole base.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.340
Maybe something from
his personal effects?

04:32.373 --> 04:34.041
And we are on the same page.

04:34.074 --> 04:39.647
This is a care package that was
sent from Franconia, Virginia.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.749
And I wouldn't eat these
if I were you.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.417
Well, is there anything
here that we can work with?

04:43.451 --> 04:46.587
Other than James Sweeney's
own fingerprints?

04:46.620 --> 04:50.658
There was no hair,
no DNA, no forensics.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.660
Hey, what are these?
Those...

04:52.693 --> 04:54.528
are the kicker.

04:54.562 --> 04:55.896
Hmm.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.731
He sent the package.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.969
Okay, everybody,
I just got the new list

05:02.002 --> 05:04.338
of deployed sailors
and Marines from the Navy.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.806
I'm gonna put 'em
on the bulletin board

05:05.839 --> 05:07.941
if you guys need a name
to put on your boxes.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.077
Hey, Tom, where's
your box going to?

05:10.110 --> 05:12.746
It's going to my wife's
sister's youngest son.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.348
Uh, what's your
special touch today?

05:14.382 --> 05:16.450
My wife made banana bread.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.652
Nice. Did you get
your new pictures yet?

05:18.686 --> 05:20.921
Yeah, sure did.
Check it out.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.457
It's too bad they couldn't edit
all the ugly out of these, huh?

05:23.491 --> 05:25.459
Hey, man, what you
talking about? I look like

05:25.493 --> 05:27.495
Denzel Washington and Wesley
Snipes rolled up in one.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.611
McGEE: Excuse me,
Mr. Ross?

05:43.644 --> 05:45.112
Oh, yeah, hey, guys.
Have a seat anywhere you want.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.146
The boxes are right over there.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.115
Oh, we're with NCIS.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.783
Uh, we have a few questions
for you.

05:49.817 --> 05:53.521
Oh, wow. Uh, yeah, ask away.

05:53.554 --> 05:56.490
Uh, anything you got to ask me,
you can ask me in front of them.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.492
Well, I'm afraid we can't.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.860
We're gonna need you to come in.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.763
What's this all about?

06:04.465 --> 06:06.667
One of your care packages
killed a sailor.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.613
BISHOP: Petty Officer
Second Class James Sweeney.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.582
McGEE: 23 years old,
married, no kids.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.084
He owns a home in Virginia
with his wife Emma.

06:24.117 --> 06:27.120
Parents were killed in a car
crash when he was 16 years old.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.922
Record?
Spotless.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.492
What about our suspect?

06:31.525 --> 06:33.160
TORRES:
Retired Marine
Sergeant John Ross.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.963
He sends out care packages
every day from

06:35.996 --> 06:38.131
his Legion Hall
in Franconia, Virginia.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.900
Every day?

06:39.933 --> 06:43.737
Got him set up in interrogation
whenever you're ready.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.806
GIBBS:
We sure that Sweeney's package

06:45.839 --> 06:47.475
was sent by Ross?

06:47.508 --> 06:48.776
Contents are consistent
with the packages

06:48.809 --> 06:50.678
he sent in the past.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.946
And not to mention
his pictures.

06:56.049 --> 06:59.453
That's the Prisoner
of War Medal.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.889
Yeah, Ross was held captive
for five years in Iran

07:01.922 --> 07:04.558
after being taken during
the raid on the U.S. Embassy.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.860
He was on duty
as a Marine Security Guard.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.170
ROSS:
Are you Gibbs?

07:17.204 --> 07:19.473
I didn't, uh...
I didn't kill anybody.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.775
Please.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.784
Petty Officer Second Class
James Sweeney.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.821
I-I never saw him before.

07:33.854 --> 07:37.558
Well, you sent him a box.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.793
I get a list
from the Navy every week.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.796
I mean, you know, I try, but my
memory's not what it used to be.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.966
Uh, look familiar to you?

07:45.999 --> 07:49.236
Uh, looks like what I send,
yeah.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.071
You make these?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.608
Listen, can you just tell me

07:54.642 --> 07:57.177
what's going on?
Yes or no?

07:57.210 --> 07:59.513
Yeah,
they're my mother's recipe.

07:59.547 --> 08:03.150
The ones sent to Petty Officer
Sweeney were laced with cyanide.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.187
It's got your name on the
return address on the label.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.991
It's got your cookies inside
and two photographs of you.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.726
Nah, this is crazy.
I don't know

08:12.760 --> 08:13.961
how poison could have gotten
into one of my...

08:13.994 --> 08:15.563
How could poison get
in one of my boxes?

08:15.596 --> 08:16.830
You tell me.

08:16.864 --> 08:20.000
I have no idea!

08:20.033 --> 08:22.836
How well do you know
your friends at the Legion Hall?

08:22.870 --> 08:25.005
They're patriots,
every single one of them.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.575
There's no way any of 'em could
have done something like this.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.577
GIBBS:
Anyone who could have put
their cookies inside your box?

08:29.610 --> 08:32.580
We all pack our own boxes.
They're all personalized.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.750
I know about you, Sergeant.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.886
I know
what you've been through.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.087
But you got
to give me something.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.755
This isn't right!

08:41.789 --> 08:42.990
I have to get out of this room!

08:43.023 --> 08:44.625
You can't keep me in this room!

08:44.658 --> 08:46.226
I have to get out
of this room!

08:47.895 --> 08:49.229
You hear me?

08:49.262 --> 08:51.832
I have to get
out of this room!

08:54.968 --> 08:56.269
What do you mean,
Ross seemed off?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.005
Oh.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.640
It was sad.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.274
He seemed
really scared.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.343
Do you think
he sent that package?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.978
Not sure.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.947
Sounds like
there's a "but" in there.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.149
Well, I did some digging.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.619
Ross has a
checkered past.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.120
How so?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.955
He had some
violent outbursts

09:14.988 --> 09:16.824
after his rescue in Iran--

09:16.857 --> 09:19.192
a bar fight in '85,
road rage in '87.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.994
Fired from
several jobs.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.262
Sounds familiar.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.799
Well, when he came back,

09:25.833 --> 09:27.367
they didn't have
the same sort of

09:27.400 --> 09:30.804
psychiatric support system
they do now.

09:30.838 --> 09:34.041
They barely knew what
PTSD was back then.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.009
So you think
he may be unstable?

09:36.043 --> 09:38.011
Uh, I-I don't know.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.648
Uh, I-I'd like to

09:40.681 --> 09:42.683
meet with him somewhere
where he feels safe.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.852
Could get a better read.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.689
All right, but do it quickly.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.191
There's a hold on all
care packages to the military

09:51.224 --> 09:52.993
till this gets
sorted out.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.594
You got it.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.340
BISHOP:
How long were you
and James together?

10:07.374 --> 10:11.044
Uh... we had met
in high school, actually.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.146
Um...

10:13.180 --> 10:15.783
even back then, he said
he was gonna join the Navy,

10:15.816 --> 10:17.985
and that we'd get married.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.419
He have any enemies?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.188
James? No.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.057
He was a really good man.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.029
We were actually gonna try
for our first child when he...

10:29.062 --> 10:30.798
when he got back.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.332
MAN: Whoa,
whoa, whoa.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.001
I'm so sorry.
It's such a zoo in here.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.969
I'm just gonna go
tell 'em to quiet down.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.171
No, no, no,
it's-it's fine.

10:38.205 --> 10:41.274
Did James ever mention the name
John Ross?

10:41.308 --> 10:44.945
No. Why?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.113
(dishes breaking,
indistinct arguing)

10:46.146 --> 10:46.980
MAN:
Leave me alone.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.349
WOMAN: You should be
ashamed of yourself.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.951
MAN: I should
be ashamed?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.152
WOMAN: Oh, now look
what you've done.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.054
I'll pick it up.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.989
Bob.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.825
You guys the cops?

10:57.858 --> 11:00.093
Uh, yep. NCIS.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.996
Well, if you want my advice,
I'd look into her.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.798
Why would we do that?

11:04.832 --> 11:07.167
You see this place?

11:07.200 --> 11:10.437
You think a petty officer's
salary paid for it?

11:10.470 --> 11:12.272
No. James' parents,

11:12.305 --> 11:14.975
my brother
and his wife,

11:15.008 --> 11:16.176
they had money.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.745
Get out of my house.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.013
They died in a car crash
six years ago,

11:20.047 --> 11:23.016
and they left everything
they had to their boys.

11:23.050 --> 11:26.920
She never had any interest
at all in James

11:26.954 --> 11:28.155
until they were dead.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.357
Get the hell outta here,
Uncle Bob.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.726
Calm down, Clyde. You don't
have to cover for her anymore,

11:32.760 --> 11:34.027
your baby brother's dead.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.729
Are you kidding me?

11:35.763 --> 11:37.297
You disrespect a dead man
in his own home?

11:37.330 --> 11:39.066
I'm not disrespecting him.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.734
I'm disrespecting her.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.171
Leave, you drunk.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.306
Okay.
Time to go, Bob.

11:46.339 --> 11:50.343
I might be drunk,
but I am not wrong.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.414
Clyde, was it?

11:54.447 --> 11:56.950
Yeah. I'm James' older brother.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.919
Your uncle always
so friendly?

11:58.952 --> 12:00.320
Uncle Bob is just angry

12:00.353 --> 12:02.856
that he didn't get any money
when my parents died.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.864
You know, Delilah's cousin
had a thing with the IRS.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.033
It's actually a
pretty funny story.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.035
Was it, uh, terrible
and he lost a ton of money

12:15.068 --> 12:16.770
after months of paperwork?

12:16.804 --> 12:19.206
Yeah, I guess it's not
that funny of a story.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.841
Yeah.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.979
Oh, we're closed.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.848
Oh, we're federal agents.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.018
McGEE:
Do you know this man?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.887
John? Yeah. He comes
in here every day

12:33.921 --> 12:35.522
to send out
those packages of his.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.324
You ever talk to him?

12:37.357 --> 12:39.159
Yeah.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.527
What does that mean?

12:40.560 --> 12:43.096
Well, if I'm being
completely honest,

12:43.130 --> 12:45.532
I think he's got a bit
of a crush on me.
TORRES: Really.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.200
And why do you say that?

12:47.234 --> 12:50.003
He thinks I don't notice,
but John always lets people

12:50.037 --> 12:51.905
budge him in line until
my station's free.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.207
Well, we're gonna need the
internal tracking information

12:54.241 --> 12:55.943
for a package he mailed out.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.812
Here, I have
a scan code for that.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.314
Okay.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.952
I

13:04.985 --> 13:07.054
What do you and
John talk about?

13:07.087 --> 13:10.824
Stuff. Uh, mainly,
my husband and kids.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.260
He'll bring in leftover cookies
from his care packages for them.

13:13.293 --> 13:17.264
I'd hold off on eating
the last batch.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.933
Uh, let's see.

13:23.971 --> 13:24.905
Huh.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.373
Wh

13:26.406 --> 13:28.175
The scan code you gave me

13:28.208 --> 13:29.576
is for a package
that got picked up

13:29.609 --> 13:32.379
by a mailman at a blue dropbox
not far from here.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.281
That unusual?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.249
Yeah, actually.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.385
DALE:
John Ross?

13:38.418 --> 13:40.954
Yeah, I-I know him.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.622
How?
DALE: Guy's basically

13:42.655 --> 13:44.391
Santa Claus for sailors.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.159
I mean, ev-everyone
knows who he is.

13:46.193 --> 13:49.096
Did Petty Officer Sweeney
ever mention that he talked

13:49.129 --> 13:50.998
to Ross before he received
the care package?

13:51.031 --> 13:53.100
I don't think so.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.069
I heard a rumor we aren't gonna
be getting boxes anymore.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.238
We're working on it.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.340
It's just that morale's
been pretty low

14:00.373 --> 14:03.176
ever since Sweeney died.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.945
We could all use a little
something from home.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.080
Thank you, Petty Officer Dale.
We'll be in touch.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.216
McGee, got something?

14:09.249 --> 14:12.185
Care package sent
to Sweeney was dropped

14:12.219 --> 14:14.087
in a blue mailbox
less than a mile

14:14.121 --> 14:16.556
from John Ross's house
in Franconia.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.059
But?
But the woman
at the post office

14:19.092 --> 14:20.227
says that John Ross always

14:20.260 --> 14:22.095
dropped off the packages
in person.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.330
Box was full of poison.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.232
Ross didn't want to be seen
with it.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.934
Yeah, I checked Ross's timeline.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.201
Mailman picked up the package

14:28.235 --> 14:29.903
on February 16,

14:29.937 --> 14:32.239
while Ross was in Chicago
at a Marine Corps reunion.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.407
Then he couldn't
have sent the package.

14:34.441 --> 14:38.178
Well, someone sure wanted
it to look like he did.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.356
Customer service.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.024
FEMALE VOICE: Press seven to....
No, I don't want to press seven

14:51.058 --> 14:52.525
to leave a voice mail.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.227
I want to talk to a human being.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.695
FEMALE VOICE: Press one for...
Human being.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.131
Hey. Where are we?

14:58.165 --> 14:59.666
Street surveillance
on the mailbox?

14:59.699 --> 15:02.169
No luck. Small town.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.303
No cameras nearby.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.205
McGEE: We're still
gathering a list

15:05.238 --> 15:08.141
of veterans who helped pack
boxes at the Legion Hall.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.043
And, so far, no connection
to the victim.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.045
Gotta connect to somebody
somewhere.

15:12.079 --> 15:15.148
Well...  There is,
just not to Sweeney.

15:15.182 --> 15:18.986
About three months ago, a
podcast host named Whit Dexter

15:19.019 --> 15:20.553
had John Ross on his show.
BISHOP: An unwitting Ross

15:20.587 --> 15:23.356
assumed the interview was
about the care packages.

15:23.390 --> 15:27.160
McGEE:
Dexter pushes insane theories
he knows are false in order

15:27.194 --> 15:29.162
to gain listeners
and advertisers.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.330
Yeah. I know who he is.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.401
All right, I'm gonna
get straight to it.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.336
There's a lot of people out
there who aren't buying

15:36.369 --> 15:38.171
your little
dog-and-pony routine.

15:38.205 --> 15:41.074
Uh, I'm not sure I understand...

15:41.108 --> 15:42.675
DEXTER:
Ah, come on, John.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.212
We all know that the U.S.
government is paying

15:45.245 --> 15:47.147
for those boxes to be shipped

15:47.180 --> 15:51.484
just to drum up support for the
failing U.S. Postal Service.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.754
You know, I-I don't have to
prove a damn thing to you.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.224
DEXTER: Well, I have several
sources who tell me

15:57.257 --> 16:00.193
that your little
stint as a "POW"

16:00.227 --> 16:03.163
was nothing more than a
paid vacation in Hawaii,

16:03.196 --> 16:07.234
used a a false flag
operation to drum up tension

16:07.267 --> 16:10.037
between the Middle East
and the U.S.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.739
Silence, folks.
You hear that?

16:12.772 --> 16:15.775
Looks like Dexter Nation
has struck a nerve.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.345
You're gonna regret this.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.147
I'm
gonna expose you

16:20.180 --> 16:22.115
for who you really are.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.650
Is there a connection
to the victim?

16:23.683 --> 16:26.286
After Ross leaves, Dexter lays
out Ross's history

16:26.319 --> 16:28.221
of violence and aggression.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.323
He promised his
listeners something big

16:30.357 --> 16:31.691
would soon be revealed

16:31.724 --> 16:33.460
to prove that Ross
is a government thug.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.496
What

16:40.233 --> 16:41.201
ROSS:
Hey.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.036
How do you
take your coffee?

16:43.070 --> 16:45.305
Oh, I like my
battery acid black.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.539
I'll handle my own sugar,
though.

16:46.573 --> 16:50.110
Blackjack. I'm on it.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.255
So, uh...

17:02.289 --> 17:04.424
Why'd you ask
about Whit Dexter?

17:04.457 --> 17:06.426
He killed that sailor,
didn't he?

17:06.459 --> 17:08.261
I never said that.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.796
Well, you wouldn't
have mentioned it

17:09.829 --> 17:12.265
if it wasn't
a possibility.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.700
You think he'd do it?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.235
He definitely hates
our military.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.170
Came after me personally, too.

17:19.272 --> 17:22.275
Listen, there is nothing
that man could say to you

17:22.309 --> 17:26.279
that would be worse than living
in a cage for five years.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.419
Yeah, you're right.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.189
It's not my favorite subject.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.458
Mmm.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.827
Uh, what is all
this, anyway?

17:40.860 --> 17:42.662
I'm scanning all my old
genealogy stuff

17:42.695 --> 17:44.831
so I don't lose it.
Oh.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.733
Looks like you've
found an awful lot.

17:46.766 --> 17:50.203
You know, I had a,
uh, great-great-grandfather--

17:50.237 --> 17:51.371
I-I don't know
how many greats--

17:51.404 --> 17:55.342
but he was named
after George Washington

17:55.375 --> 17:59.179
at the request of
George Washington himself.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.713
That is impressive.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.882
My family's been fighting
for this country

18:02.915 --> 18:05.185
since it was founded.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.354
Where'd you serve?

18:07.387 --> 18:09.422
Who said I served?

18:09.456 --> 18:12.225
You called your coffee
"battery acid," so...
Ah.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.594
Dead giveaway, huh?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.829
Afghanistan.

18:16.863 --> 18:21.368
Oh. That's a, that's a tough
part of the world for a woman.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.103
Tough part for anybody.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.906
This helps me.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.342
You know, knowing how hard

18:29.376 --> 18:32.212
these people worked to have
the lives they had.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.747
And paved the way
for the rest of us.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.350
Exactly.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.421
DEXTER:
And another thing,

18:41.454 --> 18:42.889
Dexter Nation.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.557
Has anyone else out there
noticed

18:44.591 --> 18:46.293
that when you call the IRS

18:46.326 --> 18:48.228
nobody answers the phone?

18:48.261 --> 18:50.463
Only letters.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.333
No real people.
Well, I have

18:53.366 --> 18:55.868
definitive proof that the IRS

18:55.902 --> 18:59.339
is nothing but a scam
run by computers.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.309
More on this after a brief word
from our sponsors.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.810
Thank you very much.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.712
That was interesting.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.680
ASSISTANT:
Three minutes,
Mr. Dexter.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.482
TORRES:
What?

19:09.516 --> 19:11.784
DEXTER:
Come around.
There's a door over here.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.386
:
Ricky.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.188
You don't just let
people into the studio.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.456
You don't know who
those guys are.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.558
They could have
a car bomb on them.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.660
Gentlemen, you got three
minutes before I'm back

19:20.693 --> 19:22.329
from commercial.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.696
My secretary says
you're with CSI?

19:23.730 --> 19:25.465
NCIS.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.500
Whatever. What do you want?

19:27.534 --> 19:29.502
We're here to ask you
a couple of questions.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.404
Is this guy for real

19:31.438 --> 19:33.506
Of course you're here to ask me
a couple of questions.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.209
You guys are cops;
you came down here to see me.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.344
Out with it.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.745
James Sweeney.

19:38.778 --> 19:39.746
What, is he a moron, too?

19:39.779 --> 19:41.381
You guys both morons?

19:41.414 --> 19:43.416
What the hell is th-- Is this
some sort of a prank show?

19:43.450 --> 19:45.485
Come on. You guys
are wasting my time.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.287
Do you know who
James Sweeney is?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.855
No. Why?

19:48.888 --> 19:50.523
He was murdered.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.759
Oh. Sucks for him.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.428
Yo. Enough with the attitude.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.230
Have a little bit of respect,
mate.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.598
:
A little bit of respect, mate,

19:58.631 --> 19:59.932
for someone I don't even know?

19:59.966 --> 20:01.834
For someone who served
his country.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.736
Oh, he was military?

20:03.770 --> 20:05.472
Yeah.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.375
Well, at least he knew
what he signed up for.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.410
Look, fellas,
I don't know him.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.512
Never seen him, never
heard of him, okay?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.447
So you ladies have any more
questions, please,

20:14.481 --> 20:15.882
feel free to contact
my attorneys.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.517
Until then, I got a show to run.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.386
Thank you.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.388
Ricky, you can show
these guys out.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.790
RICKY:
Yes, sir.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.592
You're sure James
never mentioned

20:25.625 --> 20:27.427
anyone he was
concerned about,

20:27.460 --> 20:29.429
no fights or feuds?

20:29.462 --> 20:31.598
Not that I can remember.

20:33.566 --> 20:37.637
I'm sorry. It was so hard
when he was gone, I just...

20:37.670 --> 20:40.340
It was easier for me if I stayed
focused on things back home.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.575
You mean things like the house?

20:43.943 --> 20:46.613
Hear it's a nice house.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.648
We were very lucky.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.783
What'd you say you do, again?

20:50.817 --> 20:54.387
You know all of the answers
to all these questions already.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.426
So I'm a suspect now?

21:00.560 --> 21:02.662
You're taking tips
from a drunk uncle?

21:02.695 --> 21:05.332
According to the
real estate agent,

21:05.365 --> 21:06.466
you and James
bought your house

21:06.499 --> 21:09.702
for almost $650,000
last year.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.339
Do either of you have any idea

21:12.372 --> 21:13.773
what it's like
to lose someone you love?

21:15.508 --> 21:17.544
Bank records indicate
James' father

21:17.577 --> 21:19.379
only left him $150,000.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.348
It's called a mortgage.

21:21.381 --> 21:24.884
Uncle seemed to think the
inheritance was pretty sizable.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.486
Maybe there was some more money,

21:26.519 --> 21:28.588
something James hid away?

21:28.621 --> 21:31.524
$150,000 is sizable

21:31.558 --> 21:34.427
when you're a drunk
or a 17-year-old.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.532
You know what, I thought
you guys wanted my help.

21:39.566 --> 21:40.767
I'm done here.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.773
Log on to ZNN.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.541
Okay. What happened?

21:48.575 --> 21:50.743
It's Dexter.
He's claiming you harassed him.

21:50.777 --> 21:51.978
Uh, that's not good.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.813
No, it's not.
This is nonsense.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.648
JIMMY: It's all over
the Internet. He posted on all

21:55.682 --> 21:57.617
of his social
media pages.
Yeah, well,

21:57.650 --> 21:58.885
he's been known
to do that.

22:01.554 --> 22:05.492
So, a government organization
known as NCIS

22:05.525 --> 22:06.759
just paid me a visit.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.496
These scumbags
are trying to frame me

22:09.529 --> 22:12.999
for the murder
of a sailor named James Sweeney.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.101
Now, I've learned
that this sailor

22:15.134 --> 22:16.703
was about to go on record,

22:16.736 --> 22:19.639
exposing
our old friend John Ross.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.409
But now that sailor's dead.
How did he die?

22:22.442 --> 22:27.947
From poisoned cookies in
care packages sent by John Ross.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.650
We never said a word to him
about Ross.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.151
Or anything about poison.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.654
Dexter shouldn't know
how Sweeney died.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.690
Unless he had something
to do with it.

22:47.767 --> 22:50.069
*

22:51.471 --> 22:54.541
Go tell the valet
to grab the car.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.142
You got it.
Make it quick.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.581
You son of a bitch.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.416
Wh... Easy, buddy, easy!
I ought to kill you,
you know that?

23:03.450 --> 23:05.485
Take a walk!
Take it easy there, pal!

23:05.518 --> 23:07.487
Whoa!
Who the hell
do you think you are?!

23:07.520 --> 23:08.755
You're making
a big mistake, buddy!

23:08.788 --> 23:10.657
John. John!
Oh, yeah. Hey!
Big mistake!

23:10.690 --> 23:12.525
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

23:12.559 --> 23:14.461
Everybody knows that guy
deserves a punch in the face!

23:14.494 --> 23:17.564
GIBBS: I know it!
All right, you see this,
folks

23:17.597 --> 23:20.733
NCIS chumming it up
with John Ross,

23:20.767 --> 23:22.835
the real murderer.
Yeah, this thug

23:22.869 --> 23:24.471
attacks me.

23:24.504 --> 23:27.474
Typical tyrannical government.
Andhave to...

23:27.507 --> 23:29.075
Wh... Hey. Whoa,
I'm the victim here.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.510
Yeah.

23:30.543 --> 23:31.511
You got something to say?
Come on,

23:31.544 --> 23:32.645
let's make a statement.
All right.

23:32.679 --> 23:33.813
GIBBS:
Go make a statement.

23:33.846 --> 23:34.814
I'll make a statement.

23:34.847 --> 23:37.116
Make a few statements!

23:37.149 --> 23:38.785
Come on.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.787
DEXTER: People are broke,
they're upset,

23:40.820 --> 23:44.591
and that is why the IRS
is just a big Ponzi scheme

23:44.624 --> 23:47.093
and people like you are suckers.

23:47.126 --> 23:50.597
How did you know
about the poison?

23:50.630 --> 23:53.132
You got any real questions?

23:54.266 --> 23:57.036
Gary Cooper over there
got anything to say?

23:57.069 --> 24:01.073
You know what? Been
a real pleasure, Whit.

24:04.076 --> 24:08.047
Ah. And how may I
enlighten you today, sir?

24:08.080 --> 24:09.882
Uh, big pharmaceuticals?

24:09.916 --> 24:11.250
Flat Earth theory?

24:11.283 --> 24:13.686
Got to be exhausting--

24:13.720 --> 24:16.956
keeping your lies straight,
pretending you care.

24:16.989 --> 24:20.259
I could say the same to you.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.595
How do you even look
in the mirror in the morning?

24:22.629 --> 24:25.865
Oh, usually with my eyes.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.935
What's Layla think about this?

24:28.968 --> 24:32.104
Don't talk about my daughter.
Do you ever think

24:32.138 --> 24:34.774
what school
must be like for her?

24:34.807 --> 24:37.109
She's got a dad
like you.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.512
Hell of a burden
to carry around.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.648
Don't talk about her, pal.

24:41.681 --> 24:44.984
A man's family is a line
you do not cross.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.520
Well, you've crossed
that plenty.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.589
What's life gonna be for her

24:49.622 --> 24:52.859
when she hears
her father is a murderer?

24:52.892 --> 24:56.529
: Oh. Oh, you-you
actually think I killed him.

24:56.563 --> 24:57.997
I just assumed
I was in here

24:58.030 --> 24:59.632
'cause you didn't
like what I say.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.868
Listen, I'm an
entertainer.

25:01.901 --> 25:04.303
Most of what I
say isn't true.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.574
This whole Ross thing,
it's all over the Internet.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.041
But I didn't put it there.

25:09.075 --> 25:12.044
You said on air
you were gonna expose him.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.880
Yeah, I was gonna
make something up.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.815
You released that information
yourself,

25:15.848 --> 25:18.217
and you knew your listeners
were gonna jump all over Ross.

25:18.250 --> 25:21.721
: Oh, no, no, no, no.
See, that's the beautiful thing

25:21.754 --> 25:24.090
about getting into the minds
of these people.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.625
They're ravenous.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.860
I mean, thousands of them
posted it

25:27.894 --> 25:29.862
long before I ever knew
about it.

25:29.896 --> 25:32.665
I just have the biggest voice.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.672
Ah, Dr. Mallard.
Thank you for coming.

25:39.706 --> 25:42.074
Always a pleasure, Jacqueline.

25:42.108 --> 25:45.311
And one can struggle
with tax forms

25:45.344 --> 25:48.080
for only so long.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.949
How may I be of assistance?

25:49.982 --> 25:52.619
I was hoping that you could
help me with a bit of profiling.

25:52.652 --> 25:56.355
Well, I'm always up
to a challenge.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.025
Okay. The subject is

25:59.058 --> 26:01.193
retired armed forces

26:01.227 --> 26:03.963
with past trauma
they refuse to talk about,

26:03.996 --> 26:06.699
and their whole life is

26:06.733 --> 26:08.134
still wrapped up
in the military.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.902
Unable to move on?

26:10.970 --> 26:12.772
Unwilling, at least.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.707
History of aggression?

26:14.741 --> 26:16.375
Sporadic.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.844
Intelligence?

26:17.877 --> 26:19.846
High.

26:19.879 --> 26:23.683
Has the subject
ever sought counseling before?

26:23.716 --> 26:25.718
No.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.187
What about
the family?

26:28.220 --> 26:30.189
None.

26:30.222 --> 26:33.392
Huh. And...

26:33.425 --> 26:37.664
well, your concern is what?

26:37.697 --> 26:41.167
What happens if the subject

26:41.200 --> 26:43.870
continues to internalize
what happened?

26:43.903 --> 26:45.371
Almost certainly,

26:45.404 --> 26:48.107
they'd be on the road
to disaster.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.845
Yeah. That's what I thought.

26:54.814 --> 26:58.384
Well, you... you just have
to use all your tricks

26:58.417 --> 27:00.687
to get him to open up.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.322
Thank you, Dr. Mallard.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.094
Hey, help yourself.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.328
Ah.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.931
May I have one of each?

27:11.964 --> 27:14.701
Absolutely.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.703
Thank you.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.274
Dexter confess yet?

27:22.308 --> 27:23.676
Not quite.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.678
You know, everyone
in this country

27:25.712 --> 27:28.681
is done following
the old establishment.

27:28.715 --> 27:31.283
And I'm just providing
them with something new

27:31.317 --> 27:33.119
to follow.
Whoa, whoa, where's he going?

27:33.152 --> 27:34.821
He's letting Dexter stew.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.690
Gibbs has him
right where he wants him.
Oh, good.

27:37.724 --> 27:40.359
'Cause I want to be here
when he breaks him.
Me, too.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.729
Six years ago, an up-and-coming

27:42.762 --> 27:45.431
shock jock accused me of
running a money laundering ring

27:45.464 --> 27:46.866
out of the Navy Yard.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.768
Dexter reminds you of him?

27:48.801 --> 27:50.136
Dexter is him.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.072
His claims about me
were so outrageous

27:53.105 --> 27:54.707
they never caught
any mainstream attention.

27:54.741 --> 27:55.942
But over the years,

27:55.975 --> 27:57.744
he's learned.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.746
You know, you can't
just keep me in here

27:59.779 --> 28:02.048
'cause you don't
like what I say!

28:02.081 --> 28:05.284
I got First Amendment
rights, you know.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.186
Somebody give me something.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.921
Uh, Dexter told his
lawyer we were free

28:08.955 --> 28:10.289
to go through
his cell phone.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.758
Yeah, he's
a cheeky little bugger.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.192
What'd you find?
McGEE: Well, besides

28:13.225 --> 28:14.226
the videos
he posted online,

28:14.260 --> 28:15.828
I can't find
anything incriminating

28:15.862 --> 28:16.863
in any of his texts,

28:16.896 --> 28:18.430
call logs, or search history.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.299
It's starting to look
like there isn't anything.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.301
REEVES: Yeah. He wasn't lying
when he said the information

28:22.334 --> 28:25.104
about John Ross
and the poison cookies
was all over the Internet

28:25.137 --> 28:27.106
before he reported it.
We've been trying to find

28:27.139 --> 28:28.440
the original
source, but...

28:28.474 --> 28:29.809
There are no "buts," Bishop.

28:29.842 --> 28:30.877
Boss, we've been looking,

28:30.910 --> 28:33.780
but it's like searching
for a needle in a haystack.

28:33.813 --> 28:34.613
More like hay mountain.

28:34.646 --> 28:35.815
BISHOP: We'd need
to comb through

28:35.848 --> 28:36.682
the entire
Internet to find

28:36.715 --> 28:37.984
the first post
describing the murder

28:38.017 --> 28:39.952
that all the others
piggybacked on.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.220
There's a dead sailor.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.890
There's a vet being framed.

28:43.923 --> 28:47.193
God. Find the source.

28:47.226 --> 28:51.363
Listen, I know I shouldn't
have gone after that idiot.

28:51.397 --> 28:54.801
Hey, I don't...
I don't blame you.

28:54.834 --> 28:58.370
I just want to
talk about why.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.172
Why you did it.

29:00.206 --> 29:02.341
'Cause some nutbag's out there
telling everybody

29:02.374 --> 29:03.810
that I killed a sailor.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.045
John, you have a history
of aggression.

29:06.078 --> 29:10.216
I am not interested in talking
about my feelings.

29:10.249 --> 29:14.220
I see a lot of anger hiding
behind that happy face of yours.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.889
Bottling up what
happened to you

29:16.923 --> 29:18.858
is dangerous. You get that?

29:18.891 --> 29:20.927
And how would you know?

29:22.929 --> 29:25.965
'Cause it happened to me,
too, okay?

29:29.568 --> 29:32.538
Nine months.

29:32.571 --> 29:35.875
They wanted Army intel.

29:35.908 --> 29:38.444
I never said a word.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.947
Screamed a bit.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.548
I'm-I'm so sorry.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.951
I don't know if you had
this, but it was like...

29:44.984 --> 29:47.019
they kept moving me around.

29:47.053 --> 29:49.956
So I-I didn't know
how long I'd been there

29:49.989 --> 29:52.959
or where I was, um...

29:52.992 --> 29:54.526
My problem isn't what happened
to me over there.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.263
I've... come to terms with that.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.266
It's the life they took away
from me over here.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.302
What

30:03.335 --> 30:06.372
I had a girlfriend
when I got sent to Iran.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.607
She was more than a girlfriend.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.042
She was...

30:10.076 --> 30:12.378
she was really special.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.080
What was her name?

30:14.113 --> 30:16.916
Clara.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.919
A few weeks into the mission,
before we left base,

30:19.952 --> 30:22.121
I got a letter from her

30:22.154 --> 30:24.623
saying she was pregnant
with our child.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.993
And, uh...

30:27.026 --> 30:28.995
I was thrilled.

30:29.028 --> 30:32.231
My life was all lined up.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.433
And I was gonna ask her
to marry me

30:34.466 --> 30:37.236
the second I set foot
back on American soil.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.438
But then...

30:39.471 --> 30:42.541
everything changed.

30:42.574 --> 30:46.879
You know,
they held me for five years.

30:46.913 --> 30:49.415
And after two rescue attempts
went south

30:49.448 --> 30:52.885
and my captors
cut off all communications...

30:52.919 --> 30:57.356
...uh,
everybody thought I was dead.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.228
So she moved on.

31:02.261 --> 31:03.996
When I got back,
she had a new husband,

31:04.030 --> 31:07.333
and my daughter had a father

31:07.366 --> 31:10.903
that she believed to be her own.

31:10.937 --> 31:13.572
I made her mother promise
to never tell her.

31:13.605 --> 31:16.008
I-I just...
I was in no shape to be a dad.

31:16.042 --> 31:18.945
They-they had to move on.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.947
I was a...

31:20.980 --> 31:23.515
I was a broken man
for quite a while.

31:25.451 --> 31:28.387
You know, in a lot of ways,
I still am.

31:28.420 --> 31:32.992
I th... I thought
I was better at hiding it.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.227
Where's Clara now?

31:35.261 --> 31:37.696
She and her husband
both passed on.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.198
She had a heart attack.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.600
I'm sorry.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.936
And your daughter?

31:43.970 --> 31:46.138
Oh, she still doesn't know
anything about me.

31:46.172 --> 31:48.274
Well, maybe she should.

31:48.307 --> 31:51.043
No. Just too much time
has passed.

31:51.077 --> 31:55.214
You have this mountain
of family history to share.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.683
Don't you think she'd want that?

32:00.052 --> 32:03.990
Family is who's there
when you need 'em the most.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.525
And I was never there for her.

32:06.558 --> 32:09.028
She's got her own
family history now.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.497
She'd reject me

32:11.530 --> 32:14.033
if I brought all this stuff
to her and dumped it in her lap.

32:14.066 --> 32:18.070
She'd probably hate me, even,
so... it's too late.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.717
I am not built for
all-nighters anymore.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.485
REEVES:
I forget.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.754
Can anybody beat
3:23 p.m.?

32:35.787 --> 32:38.590
Well, the earliest post I can
find describing the murder

32:38.624 --> 32:42.628
is 2:59 p.m. on a chat site
called JohnOtruth.com.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.630
Mm, I got 2:44 on Twitter.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.398
REEVES:
I can't keep them straight.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.767
Don't worry. I'm keeping
a running list of all the posts.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.103
I got it!
Thank God!

32:51.137 --> 32:55.307
Well, where was it?
Oh, it was in an e-mail
account I forgot I had.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.776
What? Well,
what are you talking about?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.445
My missing LES, baby.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.647
Pay period
eleven, 2013.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.182
I've been looking
for it all night.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.616
Wait.

33:04.650 --> 33:08.454
So... you've been in there
working on your taxes?

33:08.487 --> 33:09.755
Yes.
REEVES:
And you haven't

33:09.788 --> 33:11.623
done anything
the entire time?

33:11.657 --> 33:14.360
I can multitask.
McGEE:
I no longer

33:14.393 --> 33:16.662
feel bad the IRS wants
to take all your money.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.764
Tim...
Hold on.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.599
Oh, Abby to the rescue?

33:20.632 --> 33:23.435
ABBY:
That's what
I'm talking about.

33:23.469 --> 33:24.803
BISHOP:
Original post?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.138
ABBY:
This was posted

33:26.172 --> 33:29.175
to a Web forum
by the user name

33:29.208 --> 33:32.711
"TheJuggalution"
at 2:04 p.m.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.082
BISHOP:
At least a dozen people

33:36.115 --> 33:38.117
copied the information
onto Twitter,

33:38.150 --> 33:39.751
Facebook
and multiple other sites.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.620
From there, it
spread like wildfire.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.589
Wait. Who wrote the first thing?

33:43.622 --> 33:45.724
Well, it was a dummy account.
Like most Web handles,

33:45.757 --> 33:48.294
it didn't connect to any name,
address or bank account.

33:48.327 --> 33:51.263
But we were able to trace
the subnet of the IP address.

33:51.297 --> 33:53.599
I have no idea what that means.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.401
Oh, it means we know
where the post was sent from.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.769
Where?
You're not gonna
believe this, but

33:57.803 --> 34:02.108
it came from John Ross's
Legion Hall.
Could it be Ross?

34:02.141 --> 34:05.411
No. Sloane was with Ross
at his house in Franconia

34:05.444 --> 34:08.214
yesterday afternoon
when the post was uploaded.
BISHOP: We contacted

34:08.247 --> 34:10.482
the Legion Hall, and the vet
working at the office said

34:10.516 --> 34:12.384
that they have surveillance
on all of their computers.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.120
Torres and Reeves are
on their way there now.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.759
Jack?

34:25.864 --> 34:27.666
I told him what happened to me.

34:37.543 --> 34:40.812
I know that's a very difficult
thing for you to talk about.

34:43.182 --> 34:46.318
He has a daughter that
doesn't even know he exists.

34:46.352 --> 34:49.155
Does he know where she is?
He wouldn't say.

34:49.188 --> 34:52.891
He's fighting the demons
that came after his escape,

34:52.924 --> 34:56.595
not the experience itself, so...

34:56.628 --> 35:00.266
What about that scares you?

35:02.934 --> 35:05.504
Seeing what burying
his feelings

35:05.537 --> 35:07.873
has done to John.
He's, uh...

35:07.906 --> 35:10.476
He's angry.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.579
He's lonely.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.281
You're not like John Ross.

35:15.314 --> 35:18.250
Oh, come on, Leon.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.852
Bar fight in Texas.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.255
Road rage in Encinitas.

35:23.289 --> 35:26.225
I was ordered six months of
anger management in San Diego.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.894
That's done me a lot
of good, hasn't it?
That was a long time ago.

35:28.927 --> 35:31.863
Oh, yeah, I've gotten
really good at looking pretty

35:31.897 --> 35:34.900
and pretending to be
put together all the time, huh?

35:34.933 --> 35:38.670
Hey, you...

35:38.704 --> 35:41.207
Takes a long time to get past
what happened to you.

35:41.240 --> 35:45.244
This is not about getting
hooked up to a car battery!

35:46.845 --> 35:49.215
These are not emotions
I can just get over.

35:49.248 --> 35:52.851
This is not a problem
that can be solved!

35:54.886 --> 35:57.589
:
I should have saved them.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.659
You didn't kill them.

36:00.692 --> 36:04.496
:
But I let them die, right?

36:05.764 --> 36:07.966
I did. I did.
No.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.735
No, you...
No.
I let them...

36:09.768 --> 36:11.870
No.

36:11.903 --> 36:14.606
Don't do that.
It's okay.

36:17.543 --> 36:20.346
TOM:
Yeah, we had some issues
in the past.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.548
Some of our members were abusing
their computer privileges,

36:22.581 --> 36:24.216
and that's when we installed

36:24.250 --> 36:25.717
the surveillance cameras.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.553
We need to see
yesterday afternoon.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.488
Around 2:04 p.m.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.424
You know, I could have told
you boys from day one

36:32.458 --> 36:34.693
that you was barking up
the wrong tree with John.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.596
Yup.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.298
There you go.
2:04 p.m.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.333
That's Petty Officer
Sweeney's brother.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.834
Clyde.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.503
Hey, I know this guy.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.338
He came in to pack some boxes.

36:46.372 --> 36:48.006
It was about a month ago.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.308
Was John here?

36:49.341 --> 36:50.676
Man, John's always here.

36:50.709 --> 36:51.910
Did either of you talk
to this man?

36:51.943 --> 36:53.479
Yeah, a little bit.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.514
You know, I just remembered.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.649
He took a few boxes with him

36:57.683 --> 36:59.318
that he wanted
to pack at home.

36:59.351 --> 37:02.621
That must be
his girlfriend.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.260
That's his brother's wife.

37:08.294 --> 37:09.961
Really?

37:09.995 --> 37:12.531
Because they look like they're
getting along pretty well to me.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.965
Oh, my!

37:13.999 --> 37:15.567
Okay.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.707
You expecting someone?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.475
No.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.786
Hi, Agent Gibbs.
Agent, uh...

37:34.820 --> 37:37.022
Bishop. We're here
to talk.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.990
Right now's not really
the best time.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.626
We're looking for Clyde.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.060
We went to his apartment,
he wasn't home.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.895
And you came here?

37:43.929 --> 37:45.897
Well, yeah. I mean, we figured

37:45.931 --> 37:48.300
since you two are
sleeping together and all.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.671
Cameras at the
Legion Hall.

37:53.739 --> 37:56.041
Please.

37:56.074 --> 37:58.076
Clyde?
Yeah.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.346
NCIS is here.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.283
Clyde?

38:06.785 --> 38:07.919
Clyde, put the
weapon down.

38:09.054 --> 38:11.323
Don't move.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.792
Drop the weapon!

38:18.964 --> 38:21.066
McGEE:
NCIS! Stop!

38:26.938 --> 38:29.775
Hey!

38:34.112 --> 38:35.514
Going somewhere?

38:39.918 --> 38:42.888
McGEE:
How'd it go?

38:42.921 --> 38:46.057
Had nothing to do with
James Sweeney's inheritance.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.125
GIBBS:
Wife wanted out

38:47.158 --> 38:49.094
of the marriage for a while.

38:49.127 --> 38:51.563
She paired up with the brother
once the husband was deployed.

38:51.597 --> 38:53.532
They decided to kill James

38:53.565 --> 38:56.001
and impress Clyde's hero,
Whit Dexter,

38:56.034 --> 38:58.036
at the same time
by framing Ross.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.138
Two birds, one care package.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.840
BISHOP:
Emma and Clyde thought

39:01.873 --> 39:04.610
they could sway public opinion
with their posts.

39:15.421 --> 39:17.389
Is that your
"caught the bad guy" dance?

39:17.423 --> 39:19.024
No, that's my
"IRS messed up,

39:19.057 --> 39:22.060
and now they owe
me money" dance.
Oh, they owe you?

39:22.093 --> 39:23.962
TORRES: Yeah. The only thing
that would make this day better

39:23.995 --> 39:25.464
is if we somehow

39:25.497 --> 39:27.866
got to arrest Whit Dexter.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.701
BISHOP: Well, you get
the next best thing.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.903
He's already lost
multiple sponsors.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.039
No.
Yeah, apparently,
influencing a murder

39:34.072 --> 39:36.475
is where they finally
draw the line.
Ooh.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.810
Bazinga!

39:38.844 --> 39:40.446
Hey.

39:40.479 --> 39:44.115
You all right, Jack?

39:44.149 --> 39:45.617
Yeah.

39:45.651 --> 39:48.820
I'm, uh... perfect.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.890
So, um,

39:51.923 --> 39:53.425
John is still living a life

39:53.459 --> 39:55.126
where he can't even talk
to his own daughter.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.128
He says he doesn't even know
where to find her.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.164
You don't believe him.

39:59.197 --> 40:02.133
I think he knows
exactly where she is.

40:03.769 --> 40:06.037
How old do you think she'd be?

40:06.071 --> 40:09.107
ROSS:
I am so nervous.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.142
This could change
her whole life.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.645
What if I screw everything up?

40:13.679 --> 40:17.749
Hey, I think she'll be
glad to know the truth.

40:17.783 --> 40:21.620
I just want her to know
how much I loved her mother.

40:21.653 --> 40:24.089
And I'm ready
to tell her it's okay

40:24.122 --> 40:26.157
if she doesn't want
anything to do with me.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.159
Stop it!

40:28.193 --> 40:29.795
You're a good man.

40:29.828 --> 40:32.063
She'll see that.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.500
It's gonna be a big step
for both of you.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.104
You know, Jack,

40:39.137 --> 40:41.707
you're the first person

40:41.740 --> 40:44.175
I could ever talk to
about what happened to me.

40:48.947 --> 40:52.217
I don't, uh...

40:52.250 --> 40:56.087
I don't talk about my
experience much, either, John.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.225
It was hard, but...

41:00.258 --> 41:04.930
it definitely helped
knowing that you understand.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.734
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

41:15.206 --> 41:17.643
: Maybe I was able
to help you, too.

41:22.280 --> 41:24.550
SLOANE:
Hey, here she comes.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.554
Okay, let's do this.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.822
You got this.
Hey, Molly.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.824
I'm your dad.

41:35.861 --> 41:37.896
Thank you, Jack.

41:37.929 --> 41:40.065
Thank you, John.
