WEBVTT

00:09.467 --> 00:10.900
Life--it's literally
all we have.

00:11.000 --> 00:11.900
But is it any good?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.267
I'm a reviewer,

00:13.367 --> 00:14.267
but I don't review

00:14.367 --> 00:15.933
food, books, or movies.

00:16.033 --> 00:18.000
I review life itself.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.600
[screams]

00:19.700 --> 00:21.533
[triumphant music]

00:21.633 --> 00:23.233
[parrot squawks]

00:23.333 --> 00:26.767
*

00:26.867 --> 00:28.067
Over here.

00:28.167 --> 00:32.433
*

00:32.533 --> 00:34.700
Hello and welcome to Review.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.200
Whatever life experience
you're curious about,

00:37.300 --> 00:40.200
I will do it,
and then I will review it.

00:40.300 --> 00:43.700
I'm Forrest MacNeil,
back for more life,

00:43.800 --> 00:45.533
and how exciting
to be reunited

00:45.633 --> 00:47.933
with the world's greatest
review assignment reader,

00:48.033 --> 00:48.933
A.J. Gibbs.

00:49.033 --> 00:50.200
Hello, Forrest.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.400
- Welcome back.
- Thank you, A.J.

00:52.500 --> 00:56.000
Now let's face it, our first
season was not easy on me.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.000
- I will end you!
- Oh!

00:59.100 --> 01:00.467
You killed my father
in outer space?

01:00.567 --> 01:02.800
- Oh!
- Jack!

01:02.900 --> 01:04.267
What's it like
to get a divorce?

01:04.367 --> 01:07.500
You are gonna die alone,
so get out of here.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.900
(Forrest)
When the season was over,

01:09.067 --> 01:11.067
I spent some time
lost in the wilderness,

01:11.167 --> 01:12.933
despairing over what seemed
to be

01:13.067 --> 01:14.600
the pointless destruction
of my life.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.400
[sobbing]
Why?

01:16.500 --> 01:19.567
But then I read the inspiring
letters, tweets, and emails

01:19.667 --> 01:20.567
from my viewers,

01:20.667 --> 01:22.400
and I saw that this show

01:22.500 --> 01:25.233
gives meaning to my life
and yours.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.800
The destruction of my life

01:26.900 --> 01:28.667
was anything but pointless.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.733
Now, in order to ensure
that my life

01:30.833 --> 01:33.300
doesn't go to hell again
as I live on your behalf,

01:33.400 --> 01:36.467
I will now be permitted
to veto two reviews

01:36.567 --> 01:38.167
here in our Veto Booth.

01:38.267 --> 01:41.200
[dramatic music]

01:42.367 --> 01:44.567
Now, without any further ado,

01:44.667 --> 01:47.667
let us find out the first review
of season two.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.067
* Do, do-do-do

01:49.167 --> 01:51.167
Do, do-do-do.
Yes.

01:51.267 --> 01:55.933
Our very first review comes
from Colleen in Eugene, Oregon.

01:56.067 --> 01:57.267
Hi, Forrest.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.067
I'm at a Zen retreat right now.

01:59.100 --> 02:02.167
What's it like to get
into a bare-knuckle brawl?

02:02.267 --> 02:04.867
A bare-knuckle brawl?
Wow.

02:04.967 --> 02:06.967
Yeah. You want to dodge
this one, Forrest?

02:07.067 --> 02:08.667
Is it veto time
already?

02:08.767 --> 02:11.867
[dramatic music]

02:11.967 --> 02:13.967
No.
No, thank you, A.J.

02:14.067 --> 02:17.567
Life has knocked me down,
and I'm ready to get back up

02:17.667 --> 02:18.867
and fight.

02:18.967 --> 02:21.167
After the difficulties
of last season,

02:21.267 --> 02:24.633
I moved into my boyhood home
with my lonely father,

02:24.733 --> 02:26.833
a perfect place to embark
on this review,

02:26.933 --> 02:28.533
since the last time
I lived here,

02:28.633 --> 02:31.200
I was of an age when conflicts
were often settled

02:31.300 --> 02:32.400
with fisticuffs.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.167
Now this young man,

02:34.267 --> 02:36.900
me, had absolutely
no interest

02:37.067 --> 02:38.467
in fighting at all.

02:38.567 --> 02:41.067
I opted to avoid
such confrontations

02:41.100 --> 02:43.833
either by running away
or changing schools.

02:43.933 --> 02:46.700
As a matter of fact,
slugging my producer, Grant,

02:46.800 --> 02:49.733
at the end of last season is the
first punch I've ever thrown.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.333
- [grunting]
(all) Oh!

02:52.433 --> 02:54.333
And I have a feeling
my second punch

02:54.433 --> 02:57.200
is not too far off.

02:57.300 --> 02:58.867
I'll call you if I need
a ride home, all right?

02:58.967 --> 03:02.367
I'll come and get you,
and don't slam the door.

03:02.467 --> 03:03.367
I didn't.

03:03.467 --> 03:05.633
[dramatic music]

03:05.733 --> 03:08.067
I set out to find someone
to whom I could serve

03:08.167 --> 03:10.900
one or both
of my knuckle sandwiches,

03:11.067 --> 03:13.700
but everywhere I went,
perfectly decent people

03:13.800 --> 03:15.233
were going about their lives,

03:15.333 --> 03:19.600
failing to provoke
a righteous pummeling.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.867
[horn honks]

03:21.967 --> 03:23.767
[exhales deeply]

03:23.867 --> 03:27.900
*

03:28.067 --> 03:29.467
Aha.

03:29.567 --> 03:33.967
Well, this man just cut me
in line for the ATM.

03:34.067 --> 03:36.467
Now I have a reason to start

03:36.567 --> 03:39.067
a bare-knuckle brawl.

03:39.133 --> 03:40.933
Ahem.

03:41.067 --> 03:42.533
Excuse me.

03:42.633 --> 03:44.567
- I was next for that ATM.
- Just--

03:44.667 --> 03:47.467
- [grunts]
- Oh, [bleep]! Wow, wow.

03:47.567 --> 03:48.900
That really hurts.

03:49.067 --> 03:50.433
That's something
I had not considered,

03:50.533 --> 03:52.400
how much it hurts me
to punch somebody.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.367
Obviously it hurts when
you're getting punched, but--

03:54.467 --> 03:55.367
Ah!

03:55.467 --> 03:58.733
[gunshots]

03:58.833 --> 04:01.767
- Oh, [bleep]! [bleep]!
[people screaming]

04:01.867 --> 04:05.367
[bleep]! [bleep]!
Oh.

04:05.467 --> 04:06.800
- Yeah, I just shot somebody.
- [bleep], [bleep]!

04:06.900 --> 04:07.800
- Why?
- I don't know.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.300
I got scared, okay?

04:09.400 --> 04:11.833
Just shut up for a minute.
Let me think, Mom.

04:11.933 --> 04:13.833
[siren wails]
- Yes, it happened again, okay?

04:13.933 --> 04:16.667
Forrest?

04:16.767 --> 04:20.300
You getting this?

04:20.400 --> 04:21.533
Forrest?

04:21.633 --> 04:24.533
[dramatic music]

04:24.633 --> 04:27.267
(Forrest)
Having been shot three times
with a gun,

04:27.367 --> 04:31.433
I underwent emergency surgery
to save my life.

04:31.533 --> 04:34.367
The extreme blood loss
caused me to slip into a coma,

04:34.467 --> 04:37.533
which I can only describe
as restful.

04:37.633 --> 04:39.800
Review footage allows me
to appreciate

04:39.900 --> 04:42.700
that I received many visitors
in my unconscious state,

04:42.800 --> 04:44.167
including my producer, Grant,

04:44.267 --> 04:46.167
and my executive assistant,
Lucille,

04:46.267 --> 04:49.333
who struggled to put
their concern into words.

04:49.433 --> 04:50.800
What if we, like,
put a pillow on his face

04:50.900 --> 04:52.200
and pretended
we were smothering him?

04:52.300 --> 04:53.700
I mean, we would be
smothering him,

04:53.800 --> 04:55.067
but we'd take the pillow off,
obviously.

04:55.133 --> 04:57.200
Would he fight for life?

04:57.300 --> 05:00.567
(Forrest)
My intern, Josh, stopped by
with his new girlfriend, Tina.

05:00.667 --> 05:04.067
They behaved regrettably
during their visit.

05:04.133 --> 05:07.733
I was touched to see that even
my estranged ex-wife stopped by,

05:07.833 --> 05:11.067
and despite the presence
of this show's cameras,

05:11.167 --> 05:14.067
almost entered my room.

05:14.133 --> 05:16.733
But most frequently by my side
were my father

05:16.833 --> 05:20.167
and my nurse, Marisa,
who was holding my hand

05:20.267 --> 05:23.567
when I miraculously emerged
from two months in a coma.

05:23.667 --> 05:26.800
Excuse me,
I was next for that ATM.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.833
- Bicycle.
- Very good.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.733
(Forrest)
Marisa stayed by my side

05:34.833 --> 05:37.100
down the long road
to recovery.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.900
Conspiracy.

05:40.067 --> 05:42.067
Bridge.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.267
(Forrest)
And I'm happy to say that
we struck up

05:44.367 --> 05:45.400
a bit of a romance.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.733
(Marisa)
That's good.

05:46.833 --> 05:48.267
(Forrest)
Learning to walk again was

05:48.367 --> 05:50.833
one of the greatest challenges
of my life,

05:50.933 --> 05:53.233
but Marisa's cheerful,
nurturing presence

05:53.333 --> 05:55.067
gave me something
to walk toward.

05:55.167 --> 05:56.867
There you are.

05:56.967 --> 05:59.333
(Forrest)
Over time, we shared
our fears and struggles,

05:59.433 --> 06:01.333
and I vowed to get
strong enough

06:01.433 --> 06:04.067
to hold Marisa up
as she now held me,

06:04.167 --> 06:06.900
or as she put it one day
during therapy...

06:07.067 --> 06:09.133
I heal you,

06:09.233 --> 06:10.833
you heal me.

06:10.933 --> 06:12.233
[both laugh]

06:12.333 --> 06:14.433
- Thank you.
- I'm so proud of you.

06:14.533 --> 06:17.833
- God, Forrest, you almost died.
- Yes.

06:17.933 --> 06:19.900
Are you starting to think
that maybe you should have

06:20.067 --> 06:22.467
stayed in hiding
and not come back to Review?

06:22.567 --> 06:23.800
Quite the opposite, A.J.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.667
A near-death experience
has a way

06:25.767 --> 06:28.167
of focusing the mind on what's
really important in life,

06:28.267 --> 06:30.600
and I feel more certain
than ever before

06:30.700 --> 06:34.067
that what's important
in my life is this work.

06:34.167 --> 06:35.467
Wow.

06:35.567 --> 06:36.767
And I certainly didn't think
that my fists

06:36.867 --> 06:39.100
would lead me
to a new girlfriend.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.067
So allow me to weigh
the good and the bad things

06:42.167 --> 06:43.567
that come
from a bare-knuckle brawl

06:43.667 --> 06:47.433
and give it
a very balanced 2 1/2 stars.

06:52.333 --> 06:55.833
[triumphant music]

06:55.933 --> 06:58.700
This next one is an email
from Ahmed

06:58.800 --> 07:00.200
in East Lansing, Michigan.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.267
- East Lansing?
- Can you believe it?

07:03.367 --> 07:04.300
Yes.

07:10.833 --> 07:11.967
- Blackmail?
- Blackmail.

07:12.067 --> 07:13.700
My goodness.
Wow.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.933
Okay, well, uh,

07:16.067 --> 07:20.133
it looks like I am about
to enter the rather shady world

07:20.233 --> 07:22.900
of using people's secrets
against them.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.733
Here I go.

07:24.833 --> 07:26.200
(Josh)
And then I'd just be like,

07:26.300 --> 07:29.700
"Listen, you put $500 million
in the garbage can,

07:29.800 --> 07:31.600
"or Mr. MacNeil's gonna tell
the whole world

07:31.700 --> 07:32.967
about you,
you [bleep] pervert."

07:33.067 --> 07:34.933
- Yes. Okay.
- Yeah.

07:35.067 --> 07:37.733
So what dirt do you have
on Queen Elizabeth?

07:37.833 --> 07:40.967
I mean...

07:41.067 --> 07:43.200
I don't--
I don't really have anything.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.600
(Forrest)
My staff and I
scoured the Internet

07:45.700 --> 07:48.967
for damaging information
about prominent public figures,

07:49.067 --> 07:50.533
but we came up empty.

07:50.633 --> 07:53.600
I realized I would need
to capitalize on secrets

07:53.700 --> 07:55.800
I already possessed.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.867
Lucille, two weeks ago Friday,

07:58.967 --> 08:03.433
I saw you out
canoodling with a man,

08:03.533 --> 08:04.933
not your boyfriend, Gordon.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.200
Really thin guy
in a baggy pair of jeans?

08:07.300 --> 08:09.467
Yeah.
That was him.

08:09.567 --> 08:10.833
It would really be a shame

08:10.933 --> 08:11.967
if Gordon were to find out
about that.

08:12.067 --> 08:13.833
It was Gordon.

08:13.933 --> 08:16.300
He just had
lap band surgery.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.067
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

08:19.133 --> 08:21.067
Well, he looks great.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.100
(Forrest)
That night, my darling Marisa

08:26.200 --> 08:28.600
slept peacefully
in my childhood bed,

08:28.700 --> 08:31.967
but my concern over this review
made sleep impossible

08:32.067 --> 08:34.933
and a few extra painkillers
necessary.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.833
It was then that I realized

08:36.933 --> 08:40.067
I did know someone
with a damaging secret.

08:40.133 --> 08:42.500
Marisa had a habit
of helping herself

08:42.600 --> 08:44.800
to her patients'
leftover pills.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.867
No amount of painkillers
could anesthetize me

08:47.967 --> 08:50.533
from what I would have
to do next.

08:50.633 --> 08:53.200
My cousin Dede just got back
from the Terranea Resort.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.800
She said it's gorgeous.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.600
- We should go there sometime.
- [sighs]

08:56.700 --> 08:58.867
She said that they do
couples massages,

08:58.967 --> 09:00.767
but they come to your room,

09:00.867 --> 09:03.367
which means your room
has to be big...

09:03.467 --> 09:05.900
- Yes.
- To fit two...

09:06.067 --> 09:07.733
whole massage tables.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.600
Yes.

09:09.700 --> 09:13.667
Honey, I...
What are you doing?

09:13.767 --> 09:15.367
This bottle of Percocet

09:15.467 --> 09:17.567
is made out
to Edith Reinhardt.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.067
Uh, sweetheart...

09:20.133 --> 09:22.667
are you Edith Reinhardt?

09:22.767 --> 09:24.500
Am I--no.
I'm--no.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.200
No.
Neither am I.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.367
This bottle
of generic OxyContin

09:29.467 --> 09:31.100
is made out
to Acquanetta Hamilton.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.333
Are you
Acquanetta Hamilton?

09:34.433 --> 09:36.433
I'm--what are you doing?

09:36.533 --> 09:38.067
Neither am I.

09:38.133 --> 09:40.600
You and I aren't
any of these people

09:40.700 --> 09:44.200
because you stole
these pills.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.167
Okay.
Those people are dead now.

09:47.267 --> 09:48.600
So they're just going to be
thrown away,

09:48.700 --> 09:51.367
and it's wasteful.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.367
If you don't give me
$500 a week

09:53.467 --> 09:54.767
for the next six months,

09:54.867 --> 10:00.033
I'm gonna show, uh,
all these to your boss.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.167
[gentle piano music]

10:02.267 --> 10:04.433
Why would you do that?

10:04.533 --> 10:06.100
You're being blackmailed.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.500
I'm be--

10:08.600 --> 10:10.233
Yeah. Okay.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.167
- I'm being blackmailed?
- You're being blackmailed.

10:12.267 --> 10:13.500
Yeah.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.200
You--you did something wrong,

10:16.300 --> 10:17.567
and you're going to
have to pay--

10:17.667 --> 10:19.333
No, I understand the concept
of blackmail.

10:19.433 --> 10:21.600
- Okay.
- What is wrong with you?

10:21.700 --> 10:24.367
*

10:24.467 --> 10:27.933
Thank you.

10:28.033 --> 10:30.767
Thank you very much.

10:30.867 --> 10:32.200
Do you need money?

10:32.300 --> 10:33.567
Are you in, like,
trouble or something?

10:33.667 --> 10:36.067
I'm gonna write you
a check, okay?

10:36.167 --> 10:38.100
- You are?
- For $1,000, yes.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.933
But can you please
put the pills away?

10:40.033 --> 10:42.267
(Forrest)
Marisa seemed to feel
that writing this check

10:42.367 --> 10:43.733
would put an end
to the matter,

10:43.833 --> 10:46.200
and her misunderstanding
allowed us to move on

10:46.300 --> 10:47.533
for now.

10:47.633 --> 10:49.833
I counted this $1,000
as payment

10:49.933 --> 10:51.867
for the first
and second weeks.

10:51.967 --> 10:53.600
With the storm cloud
of extortion

10:53.700 --> 10:54.900
comfortably in the distance,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Marisa and I fell deeper

10:57.100 --> 10:59.067
and deeper in love.

10:59.167 --> 11:02.167
But when the third week came
and Marisa didn't pay,

11:02.267 --> 11:04.100
I carefully chose
a good time

11:04.200 --> 11:05.833
to remind her
of our arrangement.

11:05.933 --> 11:10.967
Oh, by the way...
[sighs]

11:11.067 --> 11:15.567
I do need that $500
by 10:00 tomorrow night,

11:15.667 --> 11:18.133
or I'm gonna just have to tell
your boss

11:18.233 --> 11:20.167
about the stolen pills.

11:20.267 --> 11:21.833
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

11:21.933 --> 11:23.900
Why would you do that
to me, you asshole?

11:24.067 --> 11:26.333
Okay, okay,
well, maybe the real question

11:26.433 --> 11:29.167
is why would you steal
narcotics, right?

11:29.267 --> 11:30.167
You took some of those pills,
Forrest.

11:30.267 --> 11:31.433
Okay, okay.
All right.

11:31.533 --> 11:32.567
You benefitted
from those pills.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.167
Let's just drop it.

11:34.267 --> 11:36.400
$500 by 10:00 tomorrow
and now let's just cuddle, okay?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.267
- No.
- I call--I call inside spoon.

11:38.367 --> 11:41.900
You can't blackmail me and then
try to be the inside spoon!

11:42.067 --> 11:44.433
(Forrest)
Marisa was not spooning,

11:44.533 --> 11:46.300
inside or out.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.500
Our relationship
was in trouble,

11:48.600 --> 11:50.533
and it was blackmail's fault.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.367
(Forrest)
I did what I could to be there

11:56.467 --> 11:58.067
for Marisa, indeed, spending
much of the blackmail money

11:58.100 --> 12:00.200
she paid me to buy
a couples massage package

12:00.300 --> 12:01.867
at the Terranea Resort.

12:01.967 --> 12:05.133
But my numerous calls
to invite her went unanswered.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.200
Hi.

12:11.300 --> 12:14.900
I hadn't heard from you,
and I was just really worried.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.733
That's because
you're blackmailing me, Forrest.

12:17.833 --> 12:20.067
You know that doesn't keep me
from missing you, right?

12:20.100 --> 12:22.400
Forrest, this is
the worst thing

12:22.500 --> 12:23.433
anyone has ever done to me.

12:23.533 --> 12:24.767
Do you get that?

12:24.867 --> 12:27.067
What happened to "I heal you,
you heal me"?

12:27.167 --> 12:29.067
Nothing has happened
to that.

12:29.100 --> 12:31.067
Just this--this is also
happening to both--

12:31.167 --> 12:32.600
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:32.700 --> 12:35.233
- I got you--no.
- I don't want them.

12:35.333 --> 12:38.200
Marisa, just tell me
what I can do.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.933
You could stop blackmailing me,
you [bleep] douchebag.

12:42.067 --> 12:44.733
Oh, come--

12:44.833 --> 12:47.600
Marisa, sweetheart,

12:47.700 --> 12:51.533
uh, I need
this week's payment.

12:51.633 --> 12:54.367
Are you [bleep]
kidding me?

12:54.467 --> 12:56.900
(Forrest)
Our relationship was
falling apart,

12:57.067 --> 12:58.667
and I was heartbroken.

12:58.767 --> 13:01.400
I'm leaving the flowers
on your doorstep, okay?

13:01.500 --> 13:03.067
Those are yours.

13:03.167 --> 13:04.800
- [bleep] flowers.
- Ow.

13:04.900 --> 13:07.333
(Forrest)
But Marisa's choice
to not pay me

13:07.433 --> 13:10.800
left me with no choice.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.833
Oh.

13:15.367 --> 13:17.833
Just wanted to stop by
and just let you know

13:17.933 --> 13:20.133
what a wonderful nurse
Marisa is.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.900
She's just a devoted,
committed nurse.

13:24.067 --> 13:26.233
That's good.

13:26.333 --> 13:31.267
You know, I just also
wanted to add...

13:31.367 --> 13:34.333
sometimes she would even,
uh, swipe pills

13:34.433 --> 13:36.900
from other patients
to give to me.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.900
Above and beyond
the call of duty,

13:40.067 --> 13:41.167
and those are some
of those pills.

13:41.267 --> 13:42.833
- Swipe pills?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

13:42.933 --> 13:44.800
Yeah, so just wanted
to let you know

13:44.900 --> 13:46.733
that you've got
a real superstar

13:46.833 --> 13:48.900
of a nurse
on your hands.

13:49.067 --> 13:50.333
There's nothing bad about her.
There's nothing bad.

13:50.433 --> 13:52.300
(Forrest)
I hoped that by emphasizing

13:52.400 --> 13:54.600
Marisa's assets
rather than her felonies,

13:54.700 --> 13:56.333
I could secure
the minimum punishment.

13:56.433 --> 13:59.233
Maybe the two would even
cancel each other out.

13:59.333 --> 14:02.733
Sadly, that evening,
I learned that was not the case.

14:02.833 --> 14:05.333
(Marisa)
Forrest!

14:05.433 --> 14:06.833
- Is that Marisa?
- Forrest!

14:06.933 --> 14:09.467
- That is Marisa.
- Get over here!

14:09.567 --> 14:12.067
- Marisa, are you okay?
- You told her!

14:12.100 --> 14:14.200
- I know.
- You told my boss!

14:14.300 --> 14:16.067
I know, I know.
I'm really sorry.

14:16.133 --> 14:18.367
- I'm really sorry.
- I lost my job.

14:18.467 --> 14:20.167
- Oh, God.
- I lost my job!

14:20.267 --> 14:22.233
I will never work
as a nurse again!

14:22.333 --> 14:23.400
What am I going to do?

14:23.500 --> 14:24.667
I really did not want that
to happen.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.067
Why did you force my hand
like that?

14:26.167 --> 14:27.467
- I forced you?
- I mean, I really had no--

14:27.567 --> 14:29.067
You did. I mean,
I asked you so many times.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.867
I could go to jail,
you [bleep]head.

14:30.967 --> 14:32.333
Okay, listen, I hope
you don't go to jail.

14:32.433 --> 14:33.500
I really do,
but if you did,

14:33.600 --> 14:34.833
I would visit you
every single day.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.200
I don't [bleep] care
if you visit me.

14:36.300 --> 14:37.467
I was in love with you.

14:37.567 --> 14:39.067
What do you mean
you were in lo--

14:39.100 --> 14:40.200
I'm still in love with you.
Nothing's changed.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.167
I'm not in love with you
anymore.

14:42.267 --> 14:44.133
You blackmailed me.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.400
Oh, wow.
I know.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.867
And sometimes
that's what blackmail is.

14:47.967 --> 14:49.233
- It hurts the people you love.
- No.

14:49.333 --> 14:50.233
- And it's really bad.
- No, no.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.700
It's really, really bad.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.133
- You hurt me...
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:54.233 --> 14:55.533
- And I hurt you.
- Oh, God! Whoa!

14:55.633 --> 14:57.233
[gunshot]
- Oh, God!

14:57.333 --> 14:59.167
Oh! Oh, my God.

14:59.267 --> 15:01.800
- Da--oh, are you all right?
- Yeah, she shot the ceiling.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.533
Oh, my God,
she was gonna shoot me.

15:03.633 --> 15:05.533
(Forrest)
Blackmail requires a callousness

15:05.633 --> 15:07.433
not suited
to the average man.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.767
Put it down!
You're pointing it at yourself!

15:09.867 --> 15:11.800
(Forrest)
It may have made me
extra money,

15:11.900 --> 15:14.867
but it made my life
immeasurably poorer.

15:14.967 --> 15:17.367
Eat a bag of [bleep]!
I hate you.

15:17.467 --> 15:19.533
(Forrest)
In trying to do this review
justice,

15:19.633 --> 15:23.433
I somehow brought disaster
to the life of someone I love.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.800
Ruined my life!

15:25.900 --> 15:29.067
I'm deeply saddened
to lose my sweet Marisa.

15:31.967 --> 15:33.800
Blackmail is bad.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.267
1 1/2 stars.

15:35.367 --> 15:36.500
Whew.

15:41.967 --> 15:45.867
[triumphant music]

15:45.967 --> 15:50.100
This review is tweeted
to us by @JustinMFR.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.133
- Aha.
- He writes...

15:55.200 --> 15:58.067
I guess, uh, I guess
I'm off to seek glory.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.833
- In a hole.
- Yes.

16:00.933 --> 16:03.667
Good. Okay.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.500
*

16:06.600 --> 16:08.767
(Forrest)
There are two types of holes
in the world,

16:08.867 --> 16:11.733
those that promise glory
and those that do not.

16:11.833 --> 16:17.067
*

16:17.167 --> 16:19.467
And though I'd never considered
the question before,

16:19.567 --> 16:22.433
it was no simple task to
distinguish one from the other.

16:22.533 --> 16:25.300
Excuse me,
is this a glory hole?

16:29.067 --> 16:31.633
That's a family hole.

16:31.733 --> 16:39.667
*

16:42.400 --> 16:44.833
Do you know if there's anything
on the Internet

16:44.933 --> 16:48.300
about where to find
anonymous sex?

16:48.400 --> 16:50.800
I think pretty much
the whole Internet is for that.

16:50.900 --> 16:53.300
That has not been my experience
with the Internet,

16:53.400 --> 16:56.167
but I'm looking
for a glory hole, in particular.

16:56.267 --> 16:57.500
Oh, if you're looking
for a glory hole,

16:57.600 --> 16:59.800
you should just go to, like,
a seedy gay bar.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.533
[chuckles]
Okay.

17:01.633 --> 17:04.167
That is quite possibly
the least helpful suggestion

17:04.267 --> 17:06.067
you could ever have made.
[chuckles]

17:06.133 --> 17:09.467
I mean, why would a woman give
anonymous oral sex at a gay bar?

17:09.567 --> 17:11.967
[chuckles]

17:12.067 --> 17:13.400
I'll look online.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.400
(Forrest)
Josh and the Internet
came through,

17:17.500 --> 17:21.700
locating a long list of
active glory holes in my area.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.867
There were a lot
of lonely ladies

17:23.967 --> 17:26.567
and a lot of glory holes
in this city.

17:26.667 --> 17:31.133
I headed to the one closest
to my dad's house.

17:31.233 --> 17:33.633
Well, here it is.

17:33.733 --> 17:37.233
I must say, the idea of placing
my member into this hole

17:37.333 --> 17:39.500
to be pleasured
by some mystery woman

17:39.600 --> 17:41.567
has me excited, yes,

17:41.667 --> 17:44.600
but also pretty nervous.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.667
Here we go.
[clears throat]

17:49.767 --> 17:51.700
[zipper unzips]

17:56.267 --> 17:57.833
[exhales]

18:08.967 --> 18:12.100
So far, uh...

18:12.200 --> 18:14.133
nothing to report.

18:17.233 --> 18:21.600
*

18:21.700 --> 18:24.700
Oh, sorry.
Just using the glory hole.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.300
(Forrest)
I had arrived a bit early,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.133
but once the sun went down

18:29.233 --> 18:31.300
and the park
was officially closed,

18:31.400 --> 18:34.400
the glory hole
was officially open.

18:38.667 --> 18:42.067
The name was right.
It was glorious.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.533
The woman behind that stall
had a talent

18:44.633 --> 18:46.733
well beyond anything
I had ever experienced...

18:46.833 --> 18:48.100
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.767
(Forrest)
Well beyond anything my ex-wife

18:49.867 --> 18:52.367
had demonstrated
on any of my birthdays.

18:52.467 --> 18:53.700
Wow.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.067
(Forrest)
I returned the next night

18:55.133 --> 18:56.733
and the night after that,

18:56.833 --> 19:01.167
and on each occasion,
the glory was equally glorious.

19:01.267 --> 19:03.133
There was etiquette
to consider...

19:03.233 --> 19:04.667
Whoa, excuse me.

19:04.767 --> 19:06.767
- I'm next for the glory hole.
- Hey, man.

19:06.867 --> 19:09.600
(Forrest)
But in general, I found
no downside to the glory hole.

19:09.700 --> 19:12.833
Myself and the other men
enjoying this woman's talents

19:12.933 --> 19:16.367
were experiencing
sexual intimacy at its best.

19:16.467 --> 19:18.533
I was completely satisfied

19:18.633 --> 19:21.300
without having to cater
to my partner's pleasure.

19:21.400 --> 19:25.200
I knew it would be a violation
of the spirit of the glory hole

19:25.300 --> 19:27.333
to meet the generous woman
on the other side

19:27.433 --> 19:28.700
of that partition,

19:28.800 --> 19:30.600
but wasn't it
equally unforgivable

19:30.700 --> 19:32.967
to let the chance
to meet her pass?

19:33.067 --> 19:35.200
Yes, it was.

19:35.300 --> 19:38.067
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:38.133 --> 19:41.933
The woman who was just in here,
did you see where she went?

19:42.067 --> 19:43.467
No.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.333
(Forrest)
I began spending
all my spare time in the park

19:49.433 --> 19:51.767
searching for my mystery mouth.

19:51.867 --> 19:55.300
And then, it happened.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.933
- Hey there.
- Hi.

19:57.067 --> 19:58.967
I've been seeing you here
a bunch lately.

19:59.067 --> 20:00.133
- [laughing]
- It's funny.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.833
Yeah.
I'm Forrest.

20:01.933 --> 20:03.133
- I'm Lynn.
- Her name was Lynn.

20:03.233 --> 20:04.867
(Forrest)
She was a PhD student

20:04.967 --> 20:07.500
and exactly the sort
of sweet-natured person who,

20:07.600 --> 20:10.367
it seemed to me, would
selflessly pleasure strange men

20:10.467 --> 20:12.333
through the partition
of a bathroom stall.

20:12.433 --> 20:15.033
Hey, I got
a crazy question for you.

20:15.133 --> 20:17.933
Hmm?

20:18.033 --> 20:19.700
Are you the woman
in the glory hole?

20:19.800 --> 20:22.200
I have been putting
my erect penis in that hole

20:22.300 --> 20:24.133
for the past week, and I just
thought I recognized you.

20:24.233 --> 20:25.533
Wait, hang on.

20:25.633 --> 20:27.367
(Forrest)
Was she the wrong woman,

20:27.467 --> 20:30.300
or was she indeed
the maven of the stall?

20:30.400 --> 20:33.633
I would never know.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.633
In most relationships,
there is a wall of some sort

20:36.733 --> 20:39.333
keeping two people
from truly seeing each other.

20:39.433 --> 20:41.967
A glory hole
makes that wall literal,

20:42.067 --> 20:43.667
but it doesn't
make the experience

20:43.767 --> 20:45.767
any less meaningful.

20:45.867 --> 20:49.000
Glory holes,
4 1/2 stars.

20:51.067 --> 20:52.333
You never did find
the woman

20:52.433 --> 20:54.167
behind that glory hole,
did you, Forrest?

20:54.267 --> 20:56.633
Sadly, no,
I did not.

20:56.733 --> 20:59.333
I have a feeling
you never will.

20:59.433 --> 21:02.167
That's all the time we have
for my first episode back.

21:02.267 --> 21:03.667
It feels great to be here.

21:03.767 --> 21:06.067
Please join us next time
on Review.

21:13.167 --> 21:15.067
Did you eat lunch yet?

21:15.167 --> 21:17.400
- You like French dip?
- Sure.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.667
- Okay.
- You know a place?

21:18.767 --> 21:20.200
Yeah.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.533
As you were.
