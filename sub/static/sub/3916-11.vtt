<i>Previously on "The Fosters"... </i>

00:01.686 --> 00:03.485
- I love you.
- I love you too.

00:03.620 --> 00:06.438
We heard from Robin. She's
recommending your adoption.

00:06.473 --> 00:09.324
Man: You're officially a member
of the Adams-foster family.

00:09.376 --> 00:11.426
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- Stef: That's Joe Olsen,

00:11.461 --> 00:13.728
the son of the owner of the
S.U.V. that hit the kids.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.397
Didn't you say the guy
on the bus was black?

00:15.432 --> 00:17.632
But if Joe lends his
father's car to the guy,

00:17.684 --> 00:19.634
hits Ana and the twins in the Volvo,

00:19.669 --> 00:21.669
- and takes off?
- You have an interesting theory.

00:21.705 --> 00:23.772
I cheated on my boyfriend.
I have to live with that.

00:23.807 --> 00:25.640
- A.J.
- Hey, Grandma.

00:25.675 --> 00:27.625
That's Mike. He's my new foster father.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.677
- Are you having an affair with Monte?
- No, she kissed me.

00:29.820 --> 00:31.820
- Surprise.
- Jesus.

00:31.872 --> 00:33.705
Stef: I had to get a second mammogram.

00:33.707 --> 00:35.590
They saw something in the first one.

00:35.642 --> 00:37.642
- What is it?
- It's a bat signal.

00:37.644 --> 00:38.660
Why are you sending Connor away?

00:38.695 --> 00:40.712
Connor asked to go live with his mom.

00:40.747 --> 00:42.680
Woman: The composer who will be performing

00:42.716 --> 00:44.682
at Disney Hall is Brandon Foster.

No, it's okay.

03:09.629 --> 03:11.496
I'm just getting ready.

03:17.504 --> 03:20.638
So, you excited?

03:20.674 --> 03:22.507
Ugh.

03:22.509 --> 03:24.592
- Oh, come on. You're gonna do great.
- Hm-mmm.

03:24.644 --> 03:27.612
But I know the feeling.
I hate speaking in public.

03:27.647 --> 03:30.481
Just don't forget to
breathe, 'cause I actually...

03:30.517 --> 03:32.517
I threw up last night before the concert.

03:32.519 --> 03:33.551
You did?

03:33.586 --> 03:34.602
Yeah.

03:34.654 --> 03:37.572
Well, you killed it.

03:37.607 --> 03:39.524
What, you don't think it went well?

03:39.559 --> 03:41.576
No, no, we rocked it, for sure.

03:41.611 --> 03:45.530
But this professor from Juilliard,

03:45.532 --> 03:47.532
after the concert, invited me

03:47.534 --> 03:49.701
to their final callbacks in New York.

03:49.753 --> 03:51.536
You're kidding.

03:51.538 --> 03:52.704
No.

03:52.706 --> 03:55.606
Okay, so why aren't you
freaking out right now?

03:55.642 --> 03:57.542
Because I looked it up

03:57.594 --> 04:00.461
and it's, like, 40,000 a
year. And that's just tuition.

04:00.513 --> 04:01.512
Yikes.

04:01.548 --> 04:02.547
Yeah.

04:02.549 --> 04:05.450
Well, we have the college fund

04:05.485 --> 04:07.435
that Grandma Sharon set up for us.

04:07.470 --> 04:08.519
That's not even gonna cover a year.

04:08.555 --> 04:10.521
Okay, you can't worry about that right now,

04:10.557 --> 04:11.556
'cause, you know, if you get in,

04:11.608 --> 04:13.474
you never know what will happen.

04:13.526 --> 04:16.560
You should go tell
Moms. They're gonna flip.

04:16.563 --> 04:19.697
Hey, how's A.J.?

04:19.733 --> 04:21.616
Sad.

04:21.651 --> 04:24.485
I mean, other than his brother,

04:24.537 --> 04:27.505
she was the only family he had, so...

she wasn't even ever here.

04:50.597 --> 04:52.597
They need the room, you know,

04:52.649 --> 04:55.683

05:00.523 --> 05:01.522
Hey.

05:03.576 --> 05:05.610
I talked to the funeral home

05:05.612 --> 05:07.445
and everything's taken care of.

05:07.497 --> 05:09.447
What?

05:09.499 --> 05:11.449
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

05:11.484 --> 05:14.485
Just, whatever your grandmother's
insurance doesn't cover, I got it.

05:14.521 --> 05:16.671
You don't have to do that.

05:16.706 --> 05:18.656
I want to.

if you haven't run the
prints on that pen yet,

06:03.553 --> 06:05.520

- You look nice.
- Oh, thank you.

06:18.409 --> 06:20.376
You put that on for Monte?

06:22.714 --> 06:25.281
Stef...

06:25.316 --> 06:26.616
We talked about this.

06:26.618 --> 06:28.684
You said you were okay
with me going back to work.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.687
Yes, and I... I am.

06:31.723 --> 06:33.539
I kind of have to be, don't I?

06:33.575 --> 06:34.657
Are you sure about that?

06:34.659 --> 06:36.292
I am.

06:36.327 --> 06:38.644
You remember what we said in the
garage... no more half-truths.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.663
Yes, I'm sure.

06:42.584 --> 06:43.683
Oh my God.

06:43.718 --> 06:45.518
What?

06:45.553 --> 06:47.403
What?

06:47.455 --> 06:49.572
The insurance company is refusing
to pay for my second mammogram.

06:49.574 --> 06:51.390
You are kidding me.

06:51.426 --> 06:52.608
Well, it's only $300,

06:52.644 --> 06:54.610
but with all of Jesus's plane tickets

06:54.646 --> 06:56.546
and Callie and Jude's
legal bills, it's just...

06:56.581 --> 06:59.382
You know, we're starting to
get a little behind, I think.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.350
Lena: It's making my head hurt.

07:01.402 --> 07:02.401
Yeah.

07:02.453 --> 07:05.254
- Hey, Ma.
- Good morning.

07:05.306 --> 07:06.422
- Good morning, Sharon.
- Where have you been?

07:06.457 --> 07:08.391
Oh, I was just... I was taking a walk.

07:08.393 --> 07:10.326
- This early?
- Yeah, you know,

07:10.328 --> 07:12.295
I'm just... I'm still on east coast time.

07:12.330 --> 07:15.264
And in your slippers? That's interesting.

07:15.366 --> 07:17.233
No, I just... I forgot my comfy shoes.

07:17.285 --> 07:19.252
Relax, Columbo.

07:19.304 --> 07:21.304
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

07:21.306 --> 07:23.656
- What's that?
- Just... it's...

07:23.691 --> 07:27.260
The insurance company doesn't
want to pay for my mammogram.

07:27.295 --> 07:29.278
What? Why not?

07:29.314 --> 07:31.714
Well, because I already had
one, and they wanted to re-image.

07:31.749 --> 07:33.699
But that is fine.
Everything's fine. I'm fine.

07:33.751 --> 07:35.685
Please don't make a big
deal out of it. Here we go.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.571
Wait a minute, sister. Listen,
you need a second opinion.

07:38.606 --> 07:40.656
No, it was a second
opinion, Mom. That was, so...

07:40.658 --> 07:42.592
Did you talk to the radiologist?

07:42.594 --> 07:44.527
No, I didn't, but you know how it goes.

07:44.562 --> 07:46.579
They read the thing, and then
the tech comes in and tells you

07:46.614 --> 07:50.366
that you're fine. And I
am. I'm fine. I'm just fine.

07:50.401 --> 07:52.435
- (Doorbell rings)
- No, no.

07:52.487 --> 07:54.453
- No, no, what?
- Stef, we need to talk about this.

07:54.505 --> 07:56.372
No, there's nothing to talk about, Mom.

07:56.424 --> 07:58.307
Please.

07:59.811 --> 08:02.245
No need to go through other people's mail!

08:02.280 --> 08:04.213
You're not other people.

08:04.265 --> 08:06.349
You're my daughter.

08:09.704 --> 08:12.255
Hi.

08:12.290 --> 08:13.723
Hi.

08:13.725 --> 08:15.725
Do you have a minute?

08:15.727 --> 08:18.244
Thanks you for sitting down with me.

08:18.296 --> 08:20.563
Now that the school year's starting again,

08:20.598 --> 08:21.731
I just thought it was important

08:21.733 --> 08:24.667
for me to apologize face to face.

08:24.702 --> 08:27.603
I realize I've put us all
in a difficult position.

08:27.605 --> 08:29.572
Yes, you have.

08:29.607 --> 08:32.541
I want you to know I'm not proud

08:32.594 --> 08:34.527
of what I said...

08:34.562 --> 08:36.611
Or did.

08:36.648 --> 08:39.548
But mostly I came here to say,

08:39.583 --> 08:43.501
if you want me to resign
from Anchor Beach, I will.

08:50.006 --> 08:53.770
Callie: And that is why I
started Fostandfound.org...

08:53.784 --> 08:57.753
So that foster kids can
find valuable resources,

08:57.755 --> 09:00.689
but more importantly, so
they can find each other.

09:01.177 --> 09:04.095
Because we all need a sense of community.

09:04.130 --> 09:06.163
And if we ever want change to happen,

09:06.199 --> 09:08.666
there needs to be a place to speak up,

09:08.718 --> 09:11.102
to come forward and tell our stories...

09:11.170 --> 09:13.154
Do you think that girl is for real?

09:13.189 --> 09:15.089
That girl is my sister.

09:15.124 --> 09:16.974
Trust me, she's for real.

09:17.009 --> 09:20.077
... even if it makes people
uncomfortable or mad.

09:20.113 --> 09:21.946
Because there's no way

09:21.998 --> 09:23.998
they're gonna fix these
problems if they don't know...

09:24.050 --> 09:26.050
So what do you think about what Monte said?

09:26.085 --> 09:28.986
Callie: I mean, how can we
expect a bunch of lawmakers

09:29.021 --> 09:30.988
and social workers to know

09:30.990 --> 09:32.890
what we're really going through

09:32.925 --> 09:34.859
when they're not living our lives?

09:34.894 --> 09:37.761
The only way real change can
happen is if we demand it.

09:42.819 --> 09:44.802
Hey.

09:44.837 --> 09:46.887
Hey, aren't you...

09:46.923 --> 09:48.772
Why aren't you in Colorado?

09:48.808 --> 09:51.142
Oh, yeah, I'm not... I'm not going back.

09:51.177 --> 09:53.727
- Why not?
- Because he's flunking out.

09:53.763 --> 09:55.813
- Mariana.
- Well, aren't you?

09:55.848 --> 09:58.215
I didn't flunk out. I was just having

09:58.251 --> 10:00.751
kind of a hard time with the classes there.

10:00.753 --> 10:04.054
But I'd prefer it if, you know,
everybody didn't know about it.

10:04.090 --> 10:05.189
So could you shut your trap for once?

10:05.224 --> 10:06.991
Fine.

10:09.306 --> 10:11.206
What are you doing?

10:11.250 --> 10:13.217
We're making posters for my campaign.

10:13.252 --> 10:15.252
Campaign? For what?

10:15.287 --> 10:18.147
Junior class president.
Emma's my campaign manager.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.215
Really? Why would you want to do that?

10:20.267 --> 10:22.184
- It's so lame.
- Jesus.

10:22.219 --> 10:25.037
Junior year is, like, the most
important year for colleges.

10:25.089 --> 10:27.106
I have to totally kill it this year
if I want to get into a good school,

10:27.158 --> 10:30.059
and not just academically.
I need, like, a full résumé

10:30.094 --> 10:33.011
- of extracurricular activities, so...
- (Snores)

10:35.066 --> 10:38.050
Oh, sorry. You were so
boring, I fell asleep.

10:38.102 --> 10:40.002
(Doorbell rings)

10:43.107 --> 10:45.074
Wha... ? Hi.

10:45.109 --> 10:46.458
- Hey.
- What the hell?

10:46.510 --> 10:48.010
Mariana: Lexi?

10:48.045 --> 10:50.446
Ah! Hi! Oh my God.

10:50.481 --> 10:53.282
What are you doing here? I just
talked to you a couple days ago.

10:53.284 --> 10:55.217
- I'm back. We're back.
- What? How?

10:55.269 --> 10:57.352
We got our visas. And the first
thing my mom did was call your mom

10:57.388 --> 11:00.172
- to make sure that I can come back to Anchor Beach.
- You're coming back?

11:00.207 --> 11:02.174
But I made her swear to secrecy,
so that I could surprise you.

11:02.226 --> 11:05.194
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

11:08.299 --> 11:11.166
Oh. Hey, Emma.

11:11.202 --> 11:13.102
Hey.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.107
Wow, it's like an ex-girlfriend
convention in here.

11:18.109 --> 11:21.009
Want me to call Hayley?
Maybe she can come over.

11:21.045 --> 11:23.011
And you have to tell everyone
how they're selling kids

11:23.047 --> 11:24.980
into these privatized foster homes.

11:24.982 --> 11:26.115
Yeah, I know about these places.

11:26.150 --> 11:28.000
My friend Kiara was in one of them.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.018
Then why aren't you
saying anything about it?

11:30.054 --> 11:31.386
I... I will.

11:31.438 --> 11:34.356
But maybe you could post on "Fost
and Found," get people talking?

11:34.408 --> 11:35.841
I... I can't.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.880
My foster family already hates me.

11:37.915 --> 11:39.832
What if they saw it?

11:39.884 --> 11:42.217
So have you spoken to your social worker?

11:42.253 --> 11:43.819
She doesn't care, okay?

11:43.821 --> 11:45.204
She works for the company.

11:45.239 --> 11:47.289
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but I need
to steal Callie for a minute.

11:50.144 --> 11:53.128
- You looked like you might need a little saving.
- Thank you.

11:53.164 --> 11:55.080
Oh, forgive me. I'm Justina Marks.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.132
I'm a foster care advocate,

11:57.168 --> 11:59.969
and I have a proposition
I hope you're gonna like.

12:00.004 --> 12:02.905
I have $50,000 I'd like to invest in you.

12:05.943 --> 12:06.976
(Knocks, door opens)

12:07.028 --> 12:08.994
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:09.046 --> 12:12.014
So did you guys come to a... ?

12:12.066 --> 12:14.950
Well, we spoke and...

12:18.889 --> 12:21.824
we both have decided that it would be best

12:21.892 --> 12:22.925
if you stayed.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.794
- Really?
- Yes.

12:25.830 --> 12:29.198
But I want to be really clear:

12:29.266 --> 12:31.166
We are not friends.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.235
We are colleagues, nothing more.

12:33.270 --> 12:37.172
My wife is being incredibly
understanding and trusting,

12:37.224 --> 12:39.158
and I think the least we can do

12:39.193 --> 12:43.145
is respect appropriate boundaries.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.014
Absolutely.

12:45.016 --> 12:48.083
Yes, absolutely.

12:48.085 --> 12:50.102
My dad has a meeting or
something when we get back,

12:50.137 --> 12:52.888
so now we leave a day early.

12:53.924 --> 12:54.990
Oh.

12:54.992 --> 12:57.042
Well, that sucks.

12:57.078 --> 12:58.811
Yeah.

12:59.980 --> 13:04.800
Wow, you're taking everything, huh?

13:07.838 --> 13:09.772
Well,

13:09.824 --> 13:12.775
I'm gonna be back in
a month, to see my dad.

13:15.279 --> 13:18.247
And my mom said

13:18.282 --> 13:20.215
you can visit whenever you want.

13:22.153 --> 13:24.153
Okay.

13:25.823 --> 13:28.157
You know, school's not gonna
be the same without you.

13:30.094 --> 13:32.094
Nothing is.

13:34.148 --> 13:35.147
Jude.

13:35.199 --> 13:39.101
I'm sorry, okay?

13:39.136 --> 13:41.136
I want to stay.

13:41.172 --> 13:43.939
Really, I do.

13:43.974 --> 13:45.090
But you gotta understand...

13:45.142 --> 13:47.943
my dad... he's never gonna change.

13:56.063 --> 13:57.090
Seen Mike?

13:57.450 --> 13:59.334
Uh, no, he went to get coffee.

13:59.369 --> 14:01.302
- You want to get this to him for me?
- Yeah, sure.

14:01.338 --> 14:02.921
What is it?

14:02.973 --> 14:04.939
He told me not to bother,

14:04.941 --> 14:06.324
but I had already run the prints.

14:06.359 --> 14:09.210
Turns out they do match
the ones from the S.U.V.

14:09.262 --> 14:11.946
So looks like maybe you got your guy.

14:11.982 --> 14:13.314
Nice work.

14:16.253 --> 14:18.152
Hey.

14:21.124 --> 14:24.259
What the hell is this?

14:24.277 --> 14:27.161
Whose prints are on this pen, Mike?

14:27.197 --> 14:29.163
From Mission Beach Elder Care, huh?

14:29.165 --> 14:31.199
Is it A.J.'s? Is this
where his grandmother is?

14:31.234 --> 14:34.118
Is that why you were telling me
to let this go? Because tell me...

14:34.170 --> 14:36.204
No. No, Stef. It's not A.J.

14:38.141 --> 14:40.108
It's his brother Ty.

14:41.161 --> 14:44.946
- What?
- Look,

14:44.981 --> 14:47.015
we were at the nursing home,

14:47.067 --> 14:49.367
and this kid came up to pick up Ty.

14:49.402 --> 14:51.336
And I thought I recognized him.

14:51.421 --> 14:54.305
And I went over to take a closer look,

14:54.357 --> 14:56.291
and it was Joe Olsen.

14:56.326 --> 14:58.326
Yeah, yeah, turns out

14:58.328 --> 15:00.261
your way-out theory... not so way out.

15:00.313 --> 15:03.898
So I ran the prints on the
pen that Ty used to sign in.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.251
Wade just said that you
told him not to bother.

15:07.287 --> 15:09.270
You planning on burying this, Mike?

15:09.322 --> 15:11.155
Look, Stef, we don't
know anything for sure.

15:11.207 --> 15:12.340
No, no, no, no, these prints match.

15:12.375 --> 15:14.292
We have a witness who can I.D. him.

15:14.294 --> 15:15.393
You're kidding me.

15:15.428 --> 15:19.247
Stef, Stef, Stef, Stef, Stef.

15:19.282 --> 15:22.166
What about A.J.? I'm just
getting through to him.

15:22.218 --> 15:24.135
He's starting to trust me.

15:24.137 --> 15:25.269
What do you think is gonna happen

15:25.305 --> 15:28.172
if I arrest the only family he's got left?

15:28.208 --> 15:31.209
What about my family... our family,

15:31.211 --> 15:34.212
all the people you love...
Jesus and Mariana, Ana, the baby?

15:34.247 --> 15:37.081
What about all the pain
they've been through, Mike?

15:42.072 --> 15:44.188
Can we at least wait
till after the funeral?

15:44.224 --> 15:46.424
Please.

15:46.459 --> 15:49.026
Look, it's in a few days.
Nobody knows anything.

15:49.062 --> 15:51.396
You cannot tell A.J. He's
gonna tell his brother,

15:51.448 --> 15:53.030
and he's gone, and you know it.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.382
I'm not stupid.

15:57.804 --> 15:59.904
Fine. I have to go.

16:09.529 --> 16:12.296
Hey.

16:12.348 --> 16:14.265
Hey there.

16:15.285 --> 16:18.336
So you're back, huh?

16:18.371 --> 16:19.420
Yeah.

16:19.472 --> 16:21.405
Can you believe it?

16:26.346 --> 16:29.146
Remember all the times we
used to make out in here?

16:30.233 --> 16:32.316
I have no idea what you're talking about.

16:34.337 --> 16:38.272
So you're not seeing Emma anymore?

16:38.308 --> 16:40.124
No, no.

16:40.159 --> 16:42.159
We ended things a long time ago.

16:42.161 --> 16:45.096
I'm not seeing anyone...

16:45.148 --> 16:46.531
actually.

16:46.566 --> 16:49.033
Huh.

16:49.085 --> 16:53.054
Well, me neither.

16:56.509 --> 16:58.442
Good to know.

17:04.384 --> 17:06.300
Well, first of all, you two are raising

17:06.336 --> 17:07.417
an amazing young woman here.

17:07.453 --> 17:10.238
Thank you. We certainly think so.

17:10.272 --> 17:12.256
And I think you're in a position

17:12.291 --> 17:13.374
to become the spokesperson

17:13.425 --> 17:15.343
the foster community has been waiting for.

17:15.377 --> 17:17.228
And I can get you in front of the people

17:17.280 --> 17:19.463
who need to hear your message,
and I have the resources

17:19.499 --> 17:21.382
you're gonna need to
expand "Fost and Found."

17:21.416 --> 17:24.185
This all sounds really exciting,

17:24.220 --> 17:26.237
but this is Callie's
senior year in high school.

17:26.289 --> 17:28.122
She's really got a lot on her plate.

17:28.174 --> 17:30.174
Do you know about privatized homes?

17:30.209 --> 17:33.144
These companies are getting
paid fees from the state

17:33.196 --> 17:35.212
every time they place
a child with a family.

17:35.248 --> 17:38.232
So the more kids they place,
the more money they make,

17:38.268 --> 17:40.184
which means that some companies are,

17:40.236 --> 17:43.120
like, pretty much taking
anyone who's willing to foster.

17:43.156 --> 17:45.156
Is there something we could do about that?

17:45.191 --> 17:47.058
Absolutely. Absolutely.

17:47.110 --> 17:49.093
I mean, there is so much
that needs to be addressed,

17:49.128 --> 17:51.495
but I think the most important
thing for us to do right now

17:51.497 --> 17:54.098
- is to look at the big picture.
- Yeah, it's just

17:54.133 --> 17:56.400
there was this kid at the event today

17:56.436 --> 17:58.052
who's in one of those homes.

17:58.087 --> 18:00.338
Look, I know how hard it
must be to have all these kids

18:00.340 --> 18:02.356
reaching out to you, hearing all
of their heartbreaking stories.

18:02.408 --> 18:05.009
But, I mean, you can't trust every kid

18:05.044 --> 18:07.211
who comes knocking at
your door, asking for help.

18:07.263 --> 18:08.379
I mean, you have to be careful.

18:08.414 --> 18:10.348
Yeah, that's true.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.366
I know that.

18:12.418 --> 18:14.285
There was just something about him.

18:14.304 --> 18:16.270
He reminded me a little bit of my brother.

18:18.291 --> 18:21.158
Give me his name. I'll make some calls.

18:21.194 --> 18:24.178
Uh, it was Jack Downey, I think.

18:24.230 --> 18:26.113
I'll see what I can do.

18:26.149 --> 18:29.083
Hey, Mom.

18:29.135 --> 18:30.167
Where are you going?

18:30.219 --> 18:32.253
You startled me. I was just taking a walk.

18:32.305 --> 18:33.270
Another one?

18:33.306 --> 18:36.107
Gotta get my steps in.

18:38.094 --> 18:40.511
So which picture should I use?

18:40.546 --> 18:42.146
- That one.
- That one.

18:42.181 --> 18:43.497
The left one, definitely.

18:43.533 --> 18:45.516
You like someone who can
really get things done.

18:45.551 --> 18:47.468
Yeah, like put people to sleep.

18:47.503 --> 18:49.387
I say right. You look super hot.

18:51.124 --> 18:53.374
But I'm not your campaign manager, so...

18:53.426 --> 18:54.458
That's right. You're not.

18:54.494 --> 18:56.460
Yeah... no, I know.

18:56.496 --> 18:58.496
But, you know, Lexi's just trying to help,

18:58.531 --> 19:01.365
and I think she kind of does have a point.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.285
- We can't be boring.
- I don't think smart is boring.

19:04.320 --> 19:07.254
I don't think that caring
about what matters is boring.

19:07.306 --> 19:10.274
I don't think that you need to
be silly and stupid to be sexy.

19:10.309 --> 19:13.127
But if that's the kind of
campaign that you want to run,

19:13.162 --> 19:14.345
then maybe I'm not the girl for the job.

19:14.380 --> 19:17.181
I should probably get home anyway.

19:17.216 --> 19:18.265
Talk to you later.

19:21.287 --> 19:23.287
Wow.

19:23.289 --> 19:25.189
She's intense.

19:25.224 --> 19:26.223
Yeah.

19:26.225 --> 19:29.093
But she's right.

19:29.128 --> 19:32.129
I think I should stick with
Emma as my campaign manager...

19:32.165 --> 19:35.066
Just Emma.

19:36.202 --> 19:38.035
Oh.

19:38.071 --> 19:39.470
I'm so happy you're back,

19:39.505 --> 19:41.505
but I think it's best

19:41.541 --> 19:44.458
if I just have one vision, you know?

19:44.494 --> 19:46.077
Okay.

19:46.129 --> 19:47.428
Got it.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.113
Sorry.

19:49.148 --> 19:50.414
No hard feelings?

19:50.450 --> 19:52.049
Yeah.

19:52.085 --> 19:54.301
No, no hard feelings.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.440
Thank you for sitting down to talk to me.

19:59.492 --> 20:02.293
I think we could do wonderful
things together, Callie.

20:02.345 --> 20:04.328
So you'll think about what I said?

20:04.363 --> 20:06.280
Yeah, yeah.

20:06.315 --> 20:07.398
Okay, bye.

20:07.450 --> 20:09.333
Bye.

20:14.273 --> 20:17.324
Hey, I need you find out where
Jack Downey's been placed.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.176
It's important.

20:26.202 --> 20:28.185
(Scoffs)

20:35.194 --> 20:36.193
Mom.

20:38.131 --> 20:39.213
Open...

20:41.150 --> 20:42.566
Police! Open up!

20:42.602 --> 20:46.504
I can hear you in there.

20:46.506 --> 20:49.490
Hi, Stefanie. How are you?

20:49.525 --> 20:52.109
What the hell is going on, Mom?

20:52.145 --> 20:54.478
Oh, this is Will...

20:54.514 --> 20:56.397
my boyfriend.

20:56.432 --> 20:57.481
What's up?

21:02.562 --> 21:04.206
I mean, really, what's going on, Mom?

21:04.334 --> 21:06.401
Why on earth would you not want
to introduce us to your boyfriend?

21:06.436 --> 21:08.353
I mean, it's not that serious, really.

21:08.355 --> 21:10.355
It's just, you know, kind of a fling,

21:10.357 --> 21:12.457
because, you know, he's young.

21:12.459 --> 21:14.342
I'm not buying that, Mom.

21:14.394 --> 21:16.261
I mean, you didn't want us to meet him

21:16.263 --> 21:18.196
because he's young and hot?

21:18.248 --> 21:19.364
Wait, he's not homophobic, is he?

21:19.366 --> 21:20.382
He'd better not be homophobic.

21:20.417 --> 21:22.217
Don't be ridiculous. Of course not.

21:22.269 --> 21:24.202
I would never even date somebody...

21:24.238 --> 21:26.271
- I would hope not.
- ... Who wouldn't like you because you're a lesbian.

21:26.323 --> 21:28.340
Actually I was a little afraid

21:28.375 --> 21:31.176
that he might like you
because you're a cop.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.326
What?

21:34.361 --> 21:36.328
Well, he's just... he's
not a fan of big government,

21:36.380 --> 21:39.230
or a big fan of government, period.

21:39.266 --> 21:41.266
- He's just...
- Wow, my mother's dating an anarchist.

21:41.335 --> 21:42.667
- That's brilliant.
- What can I tell you?

21:42.703 --> 21:45.587
You know, the heart wants what
it wants. And the sex is just...

21:45.639 --> 21:48.556
Oh, Mom, la-la-la-la!
I don't want to hear it.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.609
- You're such a prude really.
- You raised me. Please help me.

21:51.662 --> 21:54.512
We need to make a decision about Jesus.

21:54.548 --> 21:56.531
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.450
I'm not... what do we do, you know?

21:58.485 --> 22:00.585
Do we let him stay home
because he's homesick?

22:00.587 --> 22:02.654
- Yes, you should let him stay.
- Mother, I didn't ask you.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.440
- I'm just saying.
- Of course I feel for him,

22:05.492 --> 22:09.394
but I think that we should make
him go back, honor his commitment.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.329
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.334
So you're flunking out, huh?

22:16.370 --> 22:19.270
- I'm gonna kill Mariana.
- Mm-hmm.

22:19.272 --> 22:21.272
Uh, I...

22:21.324 --> 22:24.275
I guess I was just embarrassed, you know?

22:24.311 --> 22:26.227
I didn't want you guys to be ashamed of me.

22:26.279 --> 22:28.279
Well, that makes sense.

22:28.315 --> 22:29.497
Yeah.

22:29.533 --> 22:31.683
Except for the fact that
after we spoke with Mariana,

22:31.718 --> 22:33.685
I called Flintwood. They
said you're doing fine...

22:33.720 --> 22:35.320
better than fine, actually.

22:35.372 --> 22:36.688
So what the hell is going on?

22:38.642 --> 22:42.577
I didn't want to tell you guys this, but...

22:44.564 --> 22:47.232
Some of the kids on the team take steroids,

22:47.267 --> 22:49.234
and they were pressuring
me to take them too,

22:49.236 --> 22:51.503
so we could be, you know,
the strongest team possible.

22:51.505 --> 22:53.505
And these kids... they're really good,

22:53.507 --> 22:55.573
like, way better than me.

22:55.609 --> 22:57.575
So I did it

22:57.577 --> 22:59.411
for a few days,

22:59.463 --> 23:01.479
but I hated how they made
me feel. And I stopped.

23:01.515 --> 23:03.415
But here's the thing: I can't go back

23:03.450 --> 23:05.500
unless I want to keep
taking steroids, and I don't.

23:05.535 --> 23:08.386
The only way for me to
stop is if I tell Coach,

23:08.422 --> 23:10.355
and then I'm ratting out on everyone

23:10.390 --> 23:12.357
and the guys on the team
are gonna destroy me.

23:14.461 --> 23:18.263
Well, so I guess he's going
back to Anchor Beach, huh?

23:19.399 --> 23:21.332
No, he's not.

23:23.253 --> 23:25.270
There's a waiting list. And he's not on it.

23:33.263 --> 23:35.613
I'm sorry about your grandma.

23:38.251 --> 23:39.684
She seemed really cool.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.589
Well, I don't know if I'd call her cool,

23:44.624 --> 23:47.625
but she was pretty great.

23:50.497 --> 23:53.548
Well, you still have Ty. That's good.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.305
I'm sorry I missed your speech thing.

24:00.340 --> 24:02.307
How did it go?

24:02.342 --> 24:04.342
Um, okay, I guess.

24:06.379 --> 24:09.380
Afterwards this woman came up to me

24:09.416 --> 24:11.349
and told me that she wants

24:11.351 --> 24:13.351
to invest in "Fost and Found,"

24:13.386 --> 24:17.172
and she wants me to be, like,

24:17.207 --> 24:19.390
a spokesperson or something.

24:19.442 --> 24:22.277
What does that mean?

24:22.329 --> 24:25.196
I don't know. I don't really think

24:25.232 --> 24:28.199
I'm cut out to be, like,
a role model, you know?

24:28.235 --> 24:29.667
Why not?

24:29.773 --> 24:31.739
Why can't you be a role model?

24:31.775 --> 24:35.310
Well, in the comic books,
it's always the people

24:35.345 --> 24:37.278
you never think could do it
who turn out to be the hero.

24:37.314 --> 24:38.746
I mean, what if Peter Parker

24:38.782 --> 24:41.583
didn't want to be
Spider-man after he got bit?

24:41.585 --> 24:43.568
It's too bad, you know?

24:43.603 --> 24:46.621
It's just sometimes it's meant to be,

24:46.656 --> 24:48.590
Super Callie.

24:55.465 --> 24:58.349
So, listen,

24:58.401 --> 25:00.401
there's this comic convention next weekend.

25:00.437 --> 25:01.502
Comicon?

25:01.538 --> 25:04.389
No, this is smaller.

25:04.424 --> 25:07.342
- Okay.
- It's more indie. It's really cool.

25:07.377 --> 25:11.212
And I was wondering

25:11.264 --> 25:13.398
if maybe

25:13.433 --> 25:15.717
you wanted to go with me?

25:20.323 --> 25:21.689
Hey, good news.

25:21.741 --> 25:23.358
I just got a call from the Weavers.

25:23.410 --> 25:25.293
Their son got into Hilldale Prep,

25:25.345 --> 25:26.711
and he won't be returning this year,

25:26.763 --> 25:28.696
so there's an opening in the junior class.

25:28.732 --> 25:30.581
There's also a waiting list.

25:30.617 --> 25:31.799
And I just don't feel comfortable.

25:31.835 --> 25:33.718
Look, no one will ever know.
Frankly, it's not up to you.

25:33.770 --> 25:36.704
I'm the principal. Jesus
was a student here last year,

25:36.740 --> 25:39.624
and I'm thrilled he'll be
joining us again tomorrow.

25:45.615 --> 25:49.350
(Video game playing)

25:51.488 --> 25:52.453
Hey.

25:54.457 --> 25:55.423
Hey.

26:02.465 --> 26:04.432
What is that kid doing here?

26:04.484 --> 26:07.235
- I invited him.
- Why?

26:07.237 --> 26:09.704
Well, I mean, my boyfriend
is moving to L.A.,

26:09.706 --> 26:13.324
so I figured I'd better make some
new friends, if that's okay with you.

26:16.379 --> 26:18.680
- (Sighs)
- Where have you been?

26:18.822 --> 26:21.372
I went to see A.J.

26:22.442 --> 26:23.758
Nice of you.

26:25.779 --> 26:28.696
Hey, so...

26:28.782 --> 26:32.683
if you and A.J. are, like,

26:32.719 --> 26:36.487
hanging out, dating or whatever,

26:36.539 --> 26:37.655
that's... that's fine.

26:37.707 --> 26:39.557
But can we make a deal?

26:39.592 --> 26:43.561
If either of us starts seeing someone,

26:43.596 --> 26:47.465
can we just tell each other, okay?

26:47.500 --> 26:50.401
Just so we don't have to find
out about it from someone else.

26:50.403 --> 26:51.536
Okay.

26:53.473 --> 26:55.389
Okay.

26:56.609 --> 27:00.378
What did Moms say about Juilliard?

27:00.413 --> 27:02.380
Oh, I actually...

27:02.382 --> 27:05.316
I haven't had the chance to tell them yet.

27:05.318 --> 27:08.319
They're gonna be really
happy for you. I promise.

27:10.390 --> 27:12.723
- Hello.
- Hey, Grandma.

27:12.725 --> 27:15.376
Actually, can I ask you something?

27:15.411 --> 27:18.396
Uh, you made a lot of money

27:18.431 --> 27:20.314
with the stock market, right?

27:20.366 --> 27:23.634
Who wants to know?

27:23.670 --> 27:25.803
Well, I think it's gonna
be lovely, gentlemen.

27:26.019 --> 27:28.953
I promise we're going to do
right by your grandmother.

27:28.988 --> 27:31.922
And so the only thing left to attend to

27:31.958 --> 27:34.825
is the matter of the bill.

27:34.877 --> 27:36.844
Uh, that's me.

27:36.879 --> 27:39.613
- Shall we...
- Of course.

27:46.773 --> 27:48.739
Should be a nice service.

27:51.931 --> 27:54.682
Look, I know you miss her. I miss her too.

27:54.734 --> 27:55.816
It ain't that.

27:55.868 --> 27:57.751
What then?

27:57.787 --> 28:00.638
I gotta go, dude. I gotta get out of here.

28:00.673 --> 28:02.690
Soon as the funeral's
over, I gotta hit the road.

28:02.725 --> 28:05.993
Wait, hold up, why?

28:06.045 --> 28:08.596
Look, the cops have been coming around.

28:08.648 --> 28:11.048
What the hell did you do, Ty?

28:11.083 --> 28:13.651
I borrowed a car from a buddy of mine,

28:13.653 --> 28:16.003
you know, the day I was
supposed to come meet you.

28:16.038 --> 28:18.055
I got into this accident...

28:18.107 --> 28:20.891
a bad one.

28:20.943 --> 28:22.059
I almost killed some people,

28:22.111 --> 28:25.963
and I just panicked and I ran.

28:25.998 --> 28:28.933
Now the cops are coming around
and asking all these questions.

28:28.935 --> 28:31.819
I gotta go, before they start
to figure everything out.

28:31.871 --> 28:34.038
I probably should have told you
before, but I can't be hanging around.

28:34.073 --> 28:36.841
Where... where... where was the accident?

28:36.843 --> 28:38.809
Mission and "E."

28:38.861 --> 28:41.779
What kind of car was it that you hit?

28:41.814 --> 28:42.830
I don't know.

28:42.865 --> 28:44.915
Green maybe, or blue. I took off so quick.

28:44.951 --> 28:46.800
A Volvo, Ty? Was it a Volvo?

28:46.853 --> 28:48.736
It could have been. It
was like a station wagon.

28:48.771 --> 28:50.788
- Why?
- Because it was the Fosters.

28:50.823 --> 28:53.891
Those people you almost killed...
it was Mariana and Jesus.

28:53.926 --> 28:56.894
- It was the family I've been staying with.
- Does Mike know?

28:56.929 --> 28:58.762
About the accident? Yeah.

28:58.798 --> 29:00.698
But he doesn't know it was you,

29:00.700 --> 29:03.667
or else he would have arrested your ass.

29:03.669 --> 29:06.737
I gotta go. I gotta go tonight.

29:06.772 --> 29:08.656
Either you're coming with me,

29:08.708 --> 29:10.658
or you ain't never gonna see me again.

29:15.930 --> 29:19.070
So, I just... I don't know how I feel
about letting Jesus jump the line.

29:20.082 --> 29:21.715
You know, if someone found out

29:21.717 --> 29:23.049
and made a fuss, we could lose the charter.

29:23.101 --> 29:25.685
But I don't think that anyone's gonna know.

29:25.721 --> 29:28.989
And, you know, honestly, you
have done so much for that school

29:28.991 --> 29:32.092
that I think it's okay if you
take a little something in return.

29:32.127 --> 29:34.094
- (Knocks on door)
- Hi.

29:34.096 --> 29:36.062
Listen, I had a very
interesting conversation

29:36.064 --> 29:38.031
with Brandon this afternoon.

29:38.066 --> 29:40.834
He wanted to know if I would invest

29:40.886 --> 29:43.870
the $7,500 that he has left
over from his hand money.

29:43.906 --> 29:44.938
He did? Why?

29:44.990 --> 29:47.023
It seems that he has been invited

29:47.075 --> 29:49.910
for the final callbacks for Juilliard,

29:49.962 --> 29:51.912
but he doesn't think he should even try

29:51.947 --> 29:53.864
because he doesn't think
you could possibly afford it.

29:53.899 --> 29:55.816
Now I just didn't have
the heart to tell him

29:55.868 --> 29:58.018
that I didn't think even I could turn $7500

29:58.053 --> 30:00.804
into $150,000 in a year.

30:00.839 --> 30:02.856
(Phone ringing)

30:08.831 --> 30:10.730
Hello.

30:10.766 --> 30:13.700
Yes, this is she.

30:13.735 --> 30:15.735
I'm sorry, Dr. who's office?

30:15.771 --> 30:18.805
I don't understand. I never sent
my mammogram over to a Dr. Kopak.

30:18.841 --> 30:21.708
Actually, you did.

30:23.779 --> 30:25.712
Okay, you know what? I'm so sorry.

30:25.747 --> 30:27.681
I'm gonna have to call you back, be...

30:27.733 --> 30:29.115
Okay.

30:30.719 --> 30:32.986
Okay, thank you very much.

30:33.021 --> 30:34.020
Yes.

30:36.091 --> 30:39.109
You had the radiologist send my
film over to another doctor, Mom,

30:39.194 --> 30:41.127
for a second second opinion? Really?

30:41.163 --> 30:42.996
Maybe I did.

30:43.048 --> 30:44.214
- What?
- Lena: Sharon.

30:44.249 --> 30:46.967
How do you do that? What,
they can just let anybody

30:47.019 --> 30:49.035
send my... my... my records around town?

30:49.071 --> 30:51.938
No, they have security questions.

30:51.974 --> 30:53.974
They wanted to know your
mother's maiden name.

30:54.009 --> 30:56.059
Took me a second, but then I remembered.

30:56.094 --> 30:57.978
Oh my God.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.996
- What?
- Okay, just...

31:00.032 --> 31:01.948
Honey, what did they say?

31:01.950 --> 31:03.934
They want me to come back

31:03.969 --> 31:06.853
for an ultrasound, and possibly a biopsy.

31:06.889 --> 31:09.890
Oh, all right. So you'll go.

31:09.925 --> 31:12.876
No, I'm not going. The doctors
order these tests and these biopsies

31:12.928 --> 31:14.878
and all this stuff to
make money. It's a racket.

31:14.930 --> 31:17.747
And I am fine. So that's
the end of the conversation.

31:17.783 --> 31:19.699
Well,

31:19.751 --> 31:21.935
I just can't decide

31:21.970 --> 31:24.854
whether I want the lobster or the shrimp.

31:24.890 --> 31:28.658
I think I might need a second opinion.

31:28.710 --> 31:29.793
What do you think, Lena?

31:29.828 --> 31:32.128
Jesus: I think I'm gonna get the steak,

31:32.180 --> 31:34.681
or crab, or both.

31:34.733 --> 31:37.100
You're not gonna get both, Jesus, come on.

31:37.152 --> 31:39.653
Don't be a pig. This place isn't cheap.

31:39.705 --> 31:42.138
Don't be silly. You can
have whatever you want.

31:42.174 --> 31:44.724
I'm taking everybody to dinner tonight.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.693
- Mom, that's not necessary.
- Uh...

31:46.728 --> 31:48.695
No, I want to. I want to.

31:48.697 --> 31:50.697
We're celebrating, aren't we?

31:50.732 --> 31:52.699
Callie's adoption

31:52.734 --> 31:56.953
and Brandon's big debut at Disney Hall,

31:56.989 --> 31:59.005
and also the first day of school.

31:59.041 --> 32:00.924
Stef: Ohh, yeah.

32:00.976 --> 32:02.976
And we're also celebrating the fact

32:02.978 --> 32:05.946
that Brandon is headed to new
York to audition for Juilliard.

32:05.998 --> 32:08.882
- (People muttering)
- What?

32:08.884 --> 32:11.851
Grandma told us what you
talked to her about today.

32:11.853 --> 32:14.821
If you get in, we'll figure it out, okay?

32:14.856 --> 32:16.990
I just want you to focus on
your audition for now, okay?

32:17.025 --> 32:19.943
Mama, you're gonna have
four kids in college soon.

32:19.978 --> 32:22.829
It's not all about me. I gotta figure out

32:22.864 --> 32:24.831
a way to help, at least.

32:24.866 --> 32:25.932
Will: Let's be honest,

32:25.968 --> 32:28.735
the industrial-penal complex has to be fed.

32:28.770 --> 32:30.854
- What?
- He said, "penal."

32:30.906 --> 32:32.756
We arrest them. We throw away the key.

32:32.791 --> 32:34.708
That is what police do.

32:34.710 --> 32:36.843
They have a role to play,
and that's what it is.

32:36.878 --> 32:38.745
What about "protect and serve"?

32:38.780 --> 32:40.113
What about "protect and serve"?

32:40.165 --> 32:42.749
I mean, don't even get me
started about police brutality

32:42.834 --> 32:45.151
and racial profiling.

32:45.187 --> 32:48.154
Gosh, I am parched. Where is that waitress?

32:48.156 --> 32:50.707
Brandon, run over to that bar

32:50.759 --> 32:52.759
and get me a champagne cocktail.

32:52.794 --> 32:55.061
Mom, you can't send a minor over

32:55.063 --> 32:57.030
to get an alcoholic drink.

32:57.032 --> 32:59.082
Sharon: Oh, I think he's a major.

32:59.134 --> 33:01.051
Are you okay, bud?

33:03.138 --> 33:04.954
Hey, I promise

33:05.007 --> 33:07.941
you're gonna see Connor again, okay?

33:07.976 --> 33:09.943
Yeah, I know.

33:09.978 --> 33:11.978
It just won't be the same.

33:13.949 --> 33:18.818
I'm not sure I understand why he's going.

33:18.854 --> 33:21.788
Because...

33:21.823 --> 33:25.792
because his dad just doesn't get it.

33:25.827 --> 33:27.794
And he never will.

33:33.752 --> 33:34.868
What can I get you?

33:34.870 --> 33:36.853
Um, a champagne cocktail.

33:36.888 --> 33:39.706
Um, can I see some I.D.?

33:39.741 --> 33:41.124
Oh, it's not for me.

33:41.159 --> 33:43.126
It's for my grandma.

33:45.797 --> 33:47.130
Okay.

33:50.819 --> 33:52.786
What's that for?

33:52.788 --> 33:55.722
Oh, we used to have somebody
come play happy hours,

33:55.757 --> 33:58.024
but he was drunk all the
time, so they fired him.

33:58.110 --> 34:00.660
Too bad too. Tips were
really good when he was here.

34:00.729 --> 34:01.961
Why? You play?

34:03.014 --> 34:04.097
A little.

34:04.132 --> 34:07.634
Norman, this handsome dude was just asking

34:07.669 --> 34:09.034
if we ever have anyone play that piano.

34:09.036 --> 34:11.054
No, and we never will again.

34:14.141 --> 34:17.010
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

34:21.083 --> 34:23.850
- Here you go, Grandma.
- Thank you.

34:25.904 --> 34:27.920
So does it feel different,

34:27.956 --> 34:29.989
being adopted?

34:30.025 --> 34:32.809
Yeah, kinda.

34:32.860 --> 34:34.893
I finally feel safer.

34:36.882 --> 34:38.797
Must be nice.

34:38.850 --> 34:40.733
It is, yeah.

34:40.768 --> 34:42.735
Honestly, the best part of it is knowing

34:42.771 --> 34:45.705
that Jude and I aren't
gonna be separated again.

34:45.739 --> 34:47.806
(Jazz piano playing)

34:49.811 --> 34:51.694
(Cheering)

34:58.653 --> 35:00.687
What the hell is that?

35:00.722 --> 35:02.689
It's hella good, is what it is.

35:11.032 --> 35:14.701
Hey, so that comic thing next weekend...

35:14.703 --> 35:18.021
I would love to go, if you still...

35:20.025 --> 35:21.975
Yeah, yeah.

35:22.027 --> 35:23.943
Definitely.

35:26.131 --> 35:29.916
Will you please go get
another opinion, honey?

35:29.951 --> 35:31.935
It's for me.

35:31.987 --> 35:33.086
Please.

35:33.121 --> 35:35.038
You're too important to us all.

35:46.732 --> 35:48.865
Hi.

35:48.900 --> 35:52.719
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

35:54.756 --> 35:56.706
Look, this probably isn't my place,

35:56.742 --> 36:00.660
but don't give up on Connor.

36:00.696 --> 36:02.629
I'm not.

36:02.664 --> 36:04.748
I'd never give up on my son.

36:04.750 --> 36:08.685
He's the one that wanted
to go live with his mother.

36:08.737 --> 36:11.571
Absolutely. Of course you wouldn't do that.

36:11.623 --> 36:14.491
What I mean to say is

36:14.493 --> 36:17.644
don't... don't let him give up on you.

36:20.399 --> 36:22.332
(Knocks on door)

36:24.720 --> 36:27.304
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:30.409 --> 36:35.262
So you asked me to let you know

36:35.297 --> 36:38.281
if there's anything
going on with me and A.J.

36:38.317 --> 36:39.649
Uh-huh.

36:39.701 --> 36:42.335
We are going to this
comic thing next weekend.

36:42.371 --> 36:45.755
I don't know if it's,
like, a friend thing or...

36:45.791 --> 36:48.592
Okay.

36:48.627 --> 36:50.727
Yeah, I just wanted you to know.

36:52.598 --> 36:54.531
Thanks.

37:10.649 --> 37:12.449
Hey.

37:14.503 --> 37:16.453
Let's go.

37:30.552 --> 37:34.204
Okay, don't leave me. I need your
help getting to the high places.

37:34.206 --> 37:35.322
Watch out.

37:41.330 --> 37:43.246
Aww, hell.

37:50.222 --> 37:52.189
Hey.

37:52.241 --> 37:53.573
Hi.

37:53.609 --> 37:56.193
I need Connor's transcripts.

38:01.283 --> 38:05.068
I tried to get him to stay, but...

38:05.120 --> 38:09.156
I guess it's too late.

I just wanted to say I'm...

38:41.548 --> 38:45.400
I'm sorry.

38:45.435 --> 38:48.436
I'm sorry for not getting it.

39:10.630 --> 39:12.513
Did you talk to anyone about me?

39:12.548 --> 39:16.317
'Cause I just got taken away from my
foster family and put in a group home.

39:16.352 --> 39:17.568
I thought you didn't like them.

39:17.603 --> 39:19.520
I don't, but this new place sucks.

39:19.572 --> 39:22.323
Well, I mentioned it

39:22.375 --> 39:24.375
to this woman I've been
working with, but...

39:24.410 --> 39:25.376
Well, thanks a lot.

39:28.481 --> 39:31.349
Hey, do you want to, you know, stay

39:31.401 --> 39:33.417
and play games or something or... ?

39:36.322 --> 39:38.372
Nah.

39:38.408 --> 39:41.425
You guys are busy, so it's okay.

39:44.313 --> 39:46.347
See you.

39:49.452 --> 39:53.204
Well, I'm just thrilled you decided
to let me come onboard, Callie.

39:53.256 --> 39:54.455
Me too.

39:54.507 --> 39:58.275
Hey, did you ever talk to anyone
about that kid Jack Downey?

39:58.311 --> 40:00.211
Oh, no. No, I'm sorry.

40:00.263 --> 40:02.313
- I haven't had the chance to make that call yet.
- You know what?

40:02.348 --> 40:04.265
You don't have to. Don't
worry about it. But thank you.

40:04.317 --> 40:07.234
- This is Mariana, my sister.
- Hi.

40:07.270 --> 40:09.236
- Hi.
- She's been helping me with all the coding

40:09.272 --> 40:12.256
for the site, so she's
gonna set up your account.

40:12.291 --> 40:14.709
Yep, all you need to
do is create a password.

40:16.496 --> 40:18.379
Don't look.

40:18.431 --> 40:20.431
Okay.

40:20.466 --> 40:23.267
- Done.
- Awesome.

40:23.302 --> 40:26.387
You're now officially an
administrator for "Fost and Found."

40:26.439 --> 40:27.688
Yay!

40:31.377 --> 40:33.644
The biopsy we did on your breast shows

40:33.696 --> 40:35.646
that you have ductal carcinoma in situ.

40:35.698 --> 40:37.715
Which is?

40:37.750 --> 40:40.418
D.C.I.S. is the presence of abnormal cells

40:40.453 --> 40:43.654
contained inside a milk duct in the breast.

40:43.706 --> 40:47.291
So she...

40:47.326 --> 40:48.726
she has cancer?

40:48.761 --> 40:51.429
She has what we call stage zero cancer.

40:51.464 --> 40:53.414
I would recommend a lumpectomy,

40:53.466 --> 40:55.332
possibly followed by radiation,

40:55.384 --> 40:56.667
(fading) Depending on whether we find

40:56.736 --> 40:58.385
any microinvasion in the margins.

40:58.421 --> 41:01.255
Without a family history
of breast cancer...
