in Langley, maybe
a quick stop in the Caribbean.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.943
Guantanamo's lovely
this time of year.

36:52.010 --> 36:54.346
Oh, my God.
It's okay. They'll cut
a deal with you.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.914
Later you can pawn
that ring and start anew.

36:55.981 --> 36:59.485
What about me, huh?
I'm not gonna get a deal.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.152
You think I'm getting
on that thing?

37:01.219 --> 37:02.588
There is no way!
[ Man ]
Weapon down!

37:02.654 --> 37:04.590
- Stand down.
- [ Man ]
Put the gun down!

37:04.656 --> 37:06.191
Fine. You want to
stay here?

37:06.258 --> 37:07.726
Good luck
with your Russian friends.

37:07.793 --> 37:10.729
After your daring escape,
don't expect a warm reception.

37:18.470 --> 37:21.340
- [ Man ] Let's go. Turn around.
- [ Man #2 ] Keep your hands
where we can see them.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.241
Okay, you know what?
I know my rights.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.076
You will never get
a word out of me!

37:25.143 --> 37:27.979
Yeah? Well,
they're gonna get
plenty out of me!

37:33.018 --> 37:34.586
Thank you, Michael.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.889
For what?
Quality time.

37:43.128 --> 37:45.731
[ Siren Blares ]
Okay, appreciate it.
Appreciate it. Thank you.

37:45.797 --> 37:48.667
Tavian said 6:00 p.m., right?
Any word?

37:48.734 --> 37:50.602
No. Haven't heard
from Mike either.

37:50.669 --> 37:53.705
He must still be flying back.
I can't believe he's gonna be
late to his own showdown.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.707
My buddies
at Homeland Security
just bought him some time.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.876
They came through, man--
by land, by sea and by air.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.578
Yeah. You must have called in
a lot of favors.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.914
Uh-- Yeah, that,
and I kind of told them I was
tracking a smuggled weapon...

38:02.981 --> 38:04.750
that may or may not be
leaking radioactive material.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.652
[ Chuckles ]
Oh! You went nuclear on them?

38:06.718 --> 38:08.320
Yeah,
I figured it wasn't time
to pull punches.

38:08.387 --> 38:09.721
It should buy us
at least four hours.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.723
Well, let's hope Mikey
gets here quick.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.892
Yeah, and Tavian
hasn't stood him up.
[ Cell Phone Ringing ]

38:15.427 --> 38:18.129
Hey, speak of the Tavian.
I'll make sure he's here.
I'll be back.

38:18.196 --> 38:19.331
[ Beeps ]
Yeah?

38:20.332 --> 38:21.900
I thought we had
an agreement.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.469
Where is Michael Westen?

38:23.535 --> 38:25.504
Well, he's at
Brickell Key Park,
just like you wanted.

38:25.571 --> 38:27.272
He's not there.
You're lying.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.641
What? Me lie? No, he's there.
Check again. It's a big place.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.009
Maybe you haven't
looked hard enough.

38:31.076 --> 38:34.680
I'm on Brickell Key, staring at
the meeting point. No Michael.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.082
Well, I guess he just
must be running late.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.485
You know,
I'm not a patient man.

38:39.551 --> 38:42.187
This is a one-time offer.
We're done.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.691
Yeah, uh, before you skedaddle,
you might want to take a look
at the water.

38:45.757 --> 38:48.159
You see those police
patrol boats?

38:48.226 --> 38:50.896
They're not letting any boats
in or out for the next
two or three hours.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.231
We've also locked down
the airspace.

38:53.298 --> 38:58.604
Oh, and in case you were
planning a road trip, I wouldn't
exactly pack your bags.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.172
You'll get your meet with Mike,
but you're gonna have to wait.

39:01.239 --> 39:02.641
[ Beeps ]

39:02.708 --> 39:04.843
Well, we got the tiger
by the tail.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.579
Yeah, let's hope it doesn't
rip Mike's head off
when he gets here.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.251
You know,
I've been thinking.

39:13.318 --> 39:15.587
The world
is a dangerous place.

39:15.654 --> 39:20.692
I bet there are lots of
wanted types laying low
in Spain, Italy, France.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.961
Are you volunteering
for more extraction jobs?

39:23.862 --> 39:25.564
Paris is lovely
in the spring.

39:29.501 --> 39:31.737
I guess I won't be
needing this anymore.

39:33.705 --> 39:34.606
Let me.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.146
Mr. Jenson,
it was nice being
married to you.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.214
You too, Mrs. Jenson.

39:43.281 --> 39:46.017
Maybe I'll hang on to this.
Never know when I'll need it.

39:47.285 --> 39:48.787
For another job.

39:51.289 --> 39:54.359
Well, next time I'm your wife,
I prefer an Asscher-cut diamond.

39:54.426 --> 39:55.694
Good to know.

40:02.668 --> 40:04.603
Well, I guess
the honeymoon's over.

40:06.337 --> 40:08.674
I'm, uh-- I'm gonna
go to the tailor.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.309
Maybe he can turn my ripped gown
into a mini-dress.

40:11.376 --> 40:14.880
I'm gonna check in
with Sam and Jesse
about the Tavian situation.

40:16.515 --> 40:18.750
Happy hunting.

40:18.817 --> 40:21.086
Maybe later, when you're done,
we could do
a little reconnecting.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.426
Agent Pearce?

40:29.294 --> 40:30.629
Make yourself at home.

40:30.696 --> 40:32.931
Sorry.
I let myself in.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.466
But I've got something
that couldn't wait.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.101
[ Sighs ]

40:36.167 --> 40:38.436
I think I have a break
in Max's murder case.

40:38.504 --> 40:41.406
Since you worked
so hard on this, I thought you
should be the first to know.

40:41.473 --> 40:44.476
- You made it through
all the files I gave you?
- Not yet.

40:44.543 --> 40:49.715
Remember a few weeks ago,
I said we couldn't find anything
on the traffic cams?

40:49.781 --> 40:52.584
Our killer was smart enough
to avoid all of them,

40:52.651 --> 40:55.220
which means
at some point,

40:55.286 --> 40:58.657
he'd have to
turn down... here.

40:58.724 --> 41:02.060
Now, Third Street has a law firm
with security cameras
on the entrance...

41:02.127 --> 41:03.562
and lots of glass walls,

41:03.629 --> 41:06.197
which means you can see
the passing cars.

41:08.199 --> 41:11.169
I pulled the footage
from after Max was shot.

41:11.236 --> 41:14.439
Image wasn't great,
but N.S.A. helped me
clean it up.

41:14.506 --> 41:16.041
Check it out.

41:16.107 --> 41:17.075
[ Beeping ]

41:25.817 --> 41:28.186
I can explain.
The man who killed Max--

41:30.556 --> 41:32.090
It was you.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.692
You lied to me.

41:33.759 --> 41:35.527
You were there.
You killed him!

41:35.594 --> 41:38.329
No, Pearce. No.

41:38.396 --> 41:42.634
I was framed, and I knew I would
go down for this if I didn't
find the guy who did it.

41:44.870 --> 41:46.137
Now, I couldn't trust you
back then.

41:46.204 --> 41:48.607
- [ Scoffs ]
- Listen to me. I found him.

41:48.674 --> 41:50.942
Stop lying.

41:52.978 --> 41:55.413
He's Romanian.
His name is Tavian.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.616
Sam and Jesse are
tracking him right now.

41:57.683 --> 41:59.184
Just let me make
one phone ca--

42:00.919 --> 42:03.454
- Don't even think about it.
- You are making a mistake!

42:03.521 --> 42:05.223
My mistake was trusting you.

42:08.594 --> 42:11.029
Let's go. Now!
