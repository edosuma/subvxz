with making the peace-

go and represent our family.

and not us?

24:59.196 --> 25:03.497
We're the ones they found.
They don't know that there's two sets.

- Well, <i>they made one batch...</i>

quite right, so...

- they made another.
- So you guys are, like, defective?

the defectives.

25:17.548 --> 25:19.516

the war was still goin' on.

And we were possibly
the only chance for survival, so...

25:26.423 --> 25:28.983
they sent both sets,
you know, for insurance.

Were you close?
You and Zan?

25:34.265 --> 25:38.065

26:41.832 --> 26:45.496
but I didn't even want
to believe it myself-

- The thought of telling him.
- It's okay.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.598

our little secret.

- I don't even know what the war is about.
- We know it's about us.

27:09.026 --> 27:11.051
The original royal four.

27:11.128 --> 27:13.290
Some kind of revolution happened,
and they were all killed...

27:13.364 --> 27:15.696
and sent to Earth to be reborn.

27:15.766 --> 27:18.326
Ever since then,
the hood's been a war zone.

27:18.402 --> 27:21.838
Now they want peace. I know you're
not Zan, and I know it's kinda screwed...

27:21.906 --> 27:23.965
to lay all this stuff
on you, but...

27:24.041 --> 27:26.635
this meant a lot to him.

27:26.710 --> 27:30.112
He saw peace-
He saw a chance to do something with his life.

27:30.180 --> 27:33.081
This is it.

27:33.150 --> 27:38.179
- I'm not Zan.
- Don't worry. I'll be right there with you.

27:38.255 --> 27:40.952
But without you,
there is no summit.

27:41.025 --> 27:45.121
And there is no peace. Millions
of lives hang in the balance, Max.

27:45.195 --> 27:48.790
So you-
You gotta step up.

28:03.113 --> 28:05.275
Well. Here we are.

28:05.349 --> 28:07.841
And there we are.

seen everything.

- I already told them no.

He's got that same brick head as Zan.

28:23.701 --> 28:26.329
- We don't got a lot of time.
- Back off. I'm on it.

28:28.439 --> 28:31.238

this very pertinent fact?

28:55.966 --> 28:59.459
- I wanted to tell you. I just- I couldn't-
- It's okay, it's just Michael...

28:59.536 --> 29:01.937

there's nothing unusual about that.

29:02.006 --> 29:05.101
- Maria, it's not Michael.
- But you didn't know that then, Liz.

29:09.446 --> 29:11.505

either, so don't ask me to explain it, okay?

really stupid being here.

There are just so many things
that make me wonder.

31:21.143 --> 31:23.009
Like?

31:25.281 --> 31:28.876
- Do you believe in aliens?
- [Chuckles] Why not? I'm dating one.

31:28.951 --> 31:31.716
I'm kidding. Of course.
[Chuckles]

31:31.787 --> 31:34.256
You see, I'm not.

31:34.323 --> 31:38.089
- I had an experience once.
- Oh, right! Your abduction.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.527
How do you know-
Oh, did Max say something?

31:40.596 --> 31:42.564
Oh, no. No. [Chuckles]

31:42.632 --> 31:45.499
I just- I kinda
looked into your background.

31:45.568 --> 31:49.596
<i>You know, good-looking
multimillionaire...</i>

31:49.672 --> 31:51.800
buys U.F.O. Center-
kind of stirs my curiosity.

31:51.874 --> 31:53.808
So...
[Sighs]

31:53.876 --> 31:58.370
- I did an Internet search-
- And found out I'm a wacko.

31:58.447 --> 32:00.438
[Laughs]

32:03.452 --> 32:05.420
I've got a feeling
it's about to happen again.

32:06.756 --> 32:10.715
- Why?
- Um,just... things.

32:10.793 --> 32:13.194
Missing moments of time.

32:13.262 --> 32:16.254
Bizarre dreams I can't
rememberin the morning.

32:16.332 --> 32:18.858
It all reminds me
of the last time.

32:18.934 --> 32:24.498
So, if I suddenly disappear
for a couple of days...

32:24.573 --> 32:27.406
it's nothing personal.

32:27.476 --> 32:29.706
I've just been abducted.

32:34.216 --> 32:36.708

32:36.786 --> 32:39.983
No “I'm sure it won't happen again, Brody.“
“It's all in your head, Brody.“

32:40.056 --> 32:42.991
No, no. It's just that if there's one thing
that living in Roswell has taught me...

32:43.059 --> 32:45.050
it's that anything can happen.

32:45.127 --> 32:48.620
[Both Chuckling]

32:48.698 --> 32:51.292
[Sighs]
He'll never change his mind.

32:51.367 --> 32:54.997
I don't care. He's comin'
to New York, one way or another.

32:55.071 --> 32:57.597
[Scoffs]
What's that supposed to mean?

33:00.042 --> 33:02.067
You really want to know?

33:05.381 --> 33:08.817
I don't want to be
a part of this.

33:08.884 --> 33:14.550
- That chick is turning into a real problem.
- Don't worry.

33:14.623 --> 33:16.853
Max is comin' with us.
I guarantee it.

33:34.844 --> 33:37.142
- What are you doin' here?
- I had to see you.

33:41.317 --> 33:43.649
It's dangerous.

33:43.719 --> 33:48.054
I had to get something out. Something
I never got to say to Zan, and now it's too late.

33:48.124 --> 33:51.219
And I was thinking maybe if I tell you,
I can get it out of my head, you know?

33:53.095 --> 33:56.292
What is it?

33:56.365 --> 33:59.232
- I wanted to apologize.
- For what?

34:01.937 --> 34:05.464
[Sighs]
For betraying you.

34:05.541 --> 34:08.567
[Sniffles] Max, have you
ever been so crazy in love...

34:08.643 --> 34:10.635
that you'djust
do about anything?

34:12.748 --> 34:17.583
Well, back on our planet,
Vilandra- me, lsabel-

34:17.652 --> 34:19.621
this person we used to be-

34:19.688 --> 34:22.179
we had it bad for
a guy named Kivar.

34:22.257 --> 34:25.056
We sold you out, man.

34:25.127 --> 34:27.061
We're the ones with
blood on our hands.

34:27.129 --> 34:29.223
We're the ones that
got everybody killed.

34:30.366 --> 34:32.300
Vilandra was the, uh-

34:32.368 --> 34:34.666
the Benedict Arnold.

34:34.737 --> 34:39.697
But you're not Vilandra.
And neither is Isabel.

34:39.775 --> 34:43.143
Not technically, no.

34:43.212 --> 34:48.446
But she's like this... demon
I carry around inside of me.

34:48.516 --> 34:51.885
We both do, Isabel and I.
She told me so that night we met.

34:53.188 --> 34:56.250
Isabel would
never betray me.

34:56.324 --> 35:00.193
Of course not just like
I would have never shafted Zan.

35:03.799 --> 35:05.790
I'm glad she's come clean
with you about this.

35:05.868 --> 35:08.929
<i>You're lucky to have a sister
you're so tight with, you know?</i>

35:09.004 --> 35:12.872
I wish Zan and I
had been that tight.

35:19.982 --> 35:22.917
You lied to me
about Vilandra.

35:22.985 --> 35:25.215
- I don't know what you're--
- Shut up.

35:26.789 --> 35:30.453
She betrayed me.
And Michael, and Tess.

35:30.526 --> 35:32.961
And our mother.

35:33.028 --> 35:35.929
- Our whole planet.
- Who told you this?

35:35.998 --> 35:39.491
- Did she tell you this?
- She cared enough to apologize to me.

35:40.703 --> 35:43.138
I had to hear it
from a stranger.

35:43.205 --> 35:47.904
- And yet, my own sister--
- All right, Max. Fine.

35:47.977 --> 35:50.969
Fine. Now you know.

35:51.046 --> 35:55.005
I was sick of keeping it a secret.
Sick of worrying about disappointing you.

35:55.084 --> 35:57.746
- The great king.
- I trusted you!

35:57.820 --> 36:00.152
I didn't <i>do</i> anything!

36:00.222 --> 36:03.658
I didn't do anything, and I'm not gonna
stand here and be accused of something...

36:03.726 --> 36:06.354
someone else did
in another lifetime!

36:06.428 --> 36:08.795
Something completely
irrelevant.

36:08.864 --> 36:10.798
If it's so irrelevant,
then why didn't you tell me?

36:10.866 --> 36:14.029
Because! I have my own life,
and I can't live it...

36:14.103 --> 36:17.038
when I am busy trying to prove myself
to you all the time.

36:17.106 --> 36:20.337
Trying to <i>prove</i> I won't betray you!
It is exhausting, living with that.

36:20.409 --> 36:22.969
- I never asked you to prove yourself.
- Yes, you did.

36:23.045 --> 36:26.037
You treat everybody like
they're your property.

36:26.115 --> 36:29.141
I don't belong to you, Max.
I never did.

36:30.152 --> 36:32.382
I feel likel don't
even know you.

36:33.622 --> 36:38.560
How could you?
All you care about is yourself.

36:38.627 --> 36:42.120
And Liz Parker, of course.

36:42.197 --> 36:45.064
Maybe you're finally
getting what you deserve.

36:45.134 --> 36:48.536
Finally looking in the mirror and seeing
what you really are, and you are no king.

[Gasping]
I'm going to New York.

36:59.114 --> 37:01.048
That is an amazingly
bad idea, Max.

37:01.116 --> 37:03.642
If you think it's bad, Michael,
then I know it's the right thing to do.

37:03.719 --> 37:06.848
Then, fine!
Fine, go be with them!

37:08.958 --> 37:12.986
[Sobbing] I don't know what happened.
He just went crazy on me.

37:13.062 --> 37:18.364
- Don't worry. It'll be okay.
- I know.

37:23.138 --> 37:25.903
- Start spreadin' the news.
- We're leavin' today.

37:31.213 --> 37:34.672

- Word.

38:05.114 --> 38:07.105
Hi.

38:14.890 --> 38:18.622
You said...
you wanted to be friends.

38:19.628 --> 38:22.757
And... I thought about it.

38:22.831 --> 38:26.597
And... I realize that-

38:26.668 --> 38:29.638
that I can't be

38:29.705 --> 38:33.107
Because...

to you.

38:38.981 --> 38:42.178
To what we had.

38:42.251 --> 38:44.777
So, I decided
to make a clean break.

38:47.856 --> 38:49.847
Here.

39:02.438 --> 39:05.931
Max, this is yours.
I gave it to you last Christmas.

39:06.008 --> 39:08.238
I'm giving it back.

39:09.845 --> 39:15.045
I'm-l'm going to New York
with Rath and Lonnie and- and Tess.

39:15.117 --> 39:18.314
To the summit.

39:22.057 --> 39:24.856
Are you gonna come back?

39:25.861 --> 39:28.296
I don't know.

39:28.363 --> 39:30.832
I can't think
that far ahead.

get their hands on it.

39:49.151 --> 39:53.088
