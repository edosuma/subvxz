Thank you, Davenport.
Perhaps I can pick it up

11:40.967 --> 11:42.166
once everypony leaves?

11:42.201 --> 11:45.002
I'll give you twice
whatever the pony

11:45.037 --> 11:46.404

yellow one is paying!

differently ponies treat you

their attention.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.056
Are you sure that's
what happened?

12:05.091 --> 12:07.291
Wait. You can't command
ponies' attention

12:07.326 --> 12:10.027

messed up?

12:10.062 --> 12:11.529

"messed up" to you?

Honestly, how hard is it to
pretend it's not so bad?

12:20.273 --> 12:22.006
Hard.

12:22.041 --> 12:24.442
If today is any indication of
how ponies will treat me

12:24.477 --> 12:28.413
from now on, I can't simply wait
to see if my mane grows back.

Yes, well, even if everypony
isn't utterly indifferent

might not be able

12:43.362 --> 12:46.264
to fix THIS in time for
the shoot!

Can't you do a spell that
restores some semblance

12:48.501 --> 12:50.235
of my mane?

12:51.838 --> 12:56.073
The thing is, it's pretty
much like Zecora said.
