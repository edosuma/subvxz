00:25.566 --> 00:33.540
Tromaville, New Jersey, 1984. Melvin
Junko, a mop wielding healthclub janitor,

00:35.566 --> 00:42.539
a scrawny, skinny, weakling of a nerd

00:43.566 --> 00:49.538
fell into a misplaced barrel of toxic
chemical waste.

00:51.566 --> 00:59.540
Melvin was suddenly transformed into
a hideously deformed creature

00:59.600 --> 01:03.537
of super-human size and strength.

01:06.566 --> 01:14.540
He became the Toxic Avenger, the
first super-hero from New Jersey.

01:14.599 --> 01:19.604
The Toxic Avenger, or Toxie as he is
affectionately called,

01:19.666 --> 01:23.536
went on to crush crime, beat
corruption

01:26.599 --> 01:31.538
and blast chemical waste in his
hometown of Tromaville.

01:31.599 --> 01:39.541
ARer cleaning up Tromaville, in
1 988, The Toxic Avenger rose from beneath

01:39.599 --> 01:45.505
rubble of retirement to challenge the
evil Chairman of Apocalypse Inc.

01:45.566 --> 01:50.537
Toxie's awesome adventure took him on
an outrageous journey

01:50.599 --> 01:55.538
to Japan where Toxie continued to
crush crime.

01:55.599 --> 02:02.540
ln Japan, Toxie learned the spiritual
discipline of Sumo wrestling.

02:02.599 --> 02:06.537
And the power, beauty and grace of
Sumo

02:06.599 --> 02:11.538
made him better able to rip bad
people's heads off.

02:11.599 --> 02:22.544
Now, evil has returned to Tromaville.
You are about to witness what may be

02:22.599 --> 02:27.538
The Last Temptation of Toxie.

02:58.566 --> 03:03.537
l can't make up my mind. l can't make
up my mind.

03:05.566 --> 03:05.566
Oy, Lionstein.

03:07.566 --> 03:08.533
What?

03:08.699 --> 03:11.536
How many times l have to tell you? You
don't put Redneck Zombies

03:11.599 --> 03:13.535
in with the Walt Disney.

03:14.233 --> 03:17.536
Did you see the Redneck Zombies? That
was gruesome.

03:17.599 --> 03:22.004
Gruesome! You want gruesome, you should
see my mother-in-law. That's gruesome.

03:41.566 --> 03:47.538
Drop those video cassettes or l'll blow
your brains out!

03:50.566 --> 03:53.535
My boy, my boy.

04:10.533 --> 04:14.970
Shut the hell up. There's too much
variety in this store.

Now that this is a company town,
you're all gonna rent company tapes. Right?

video tapes

04:27.566 --> 04:30.535

Self-lmprovement Tapes from Apocalypse.

04:30.600 --> 04:35.504
We like having a lot of choices.

04:35.566 --> 04:40.504
We don't want iust top twenty. We like
those movies from Troma.

04:40.566 --> 04:41.533
Screw Troma movies.

04:42.233 --> 04:49.506
Wait a minute. Do you want variety? Do
you want choice?

04:49.566 --> 04:52.535

And we're the Warner Brothers.

04:59.600 --> 05:04.438

05:12.933 --> 05:14.534
No!

06:05.566 --> 06:09.202
Please pick up the phone.

06:15.566 --> 06:29.313
lt's amazing how they make this cardboard
piece of shit look real. Piece of shit.

06:48.566 --> 06:52.303
Look what they're doing.

07:18.566 --> 07:25.239
You know dude, you don't have much
intestinal fortitude.

07:27.566 --> 07:30.502
Oy, oy, oy.

07:36.566 --> 07:44.941
Tore your guts out. Skip to my lou,
skip to my lou my darling.

07:57.566 --> 08:05.740
Excuse me folks. How about checking out
or adult section?

08:33.566 --> 08:37.336
Good looking guy.

09:15.566 --> 09:19.536
Very good. Very good.

09:49.600 --> 09:53.370
Hey faggot!

09:53.433 --> 09:56.536
You talking to me?

09:57.766 --> 10:01.669
Hit 'em. Kick 'em.

10:19.700 --> 10:23.870
Don't touch that dial.

10:57.566 --> 11:02.537
You must die.

11:32.033 --> 11:34.535
Alright.

11:34.600 --> 11:41.840
People of Tromaville, The Toxic Avenger
is back and better than ever.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.534
The Toxic Avenger's back.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.537
He's a real man.

11:51.799 --> 11:55.503
Thank you Toxie. You saved us.

11:55.566 --> 11:59.536
Yeah. But it was a rough day. Even for a
hideously deformed creature

11:59.600 --> 12:01.535
of super-human size and strength.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.535
What a mensch.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.469
Yes, l was a Toxic mensch. l was back
fighting crime, corruption and toxic waste.

12:12.366 --> 12:13.400
But it wasn't always that way.

12:13.466 --> 12:18.337
Who would believe that iust a few short
months ago l had actually joined

12:18.399 --> 12:23.571
the forces of evil. l had actually
broken my oath to protect the little people

12:23.633 --> 12:32.208
of Tromaville. l, the Toxic Avenger had
become a bad dude. A toxic trouble-maker.

12:32.266 --> 12:38.872
lt's a long story, so you better sit
back. This is how it all began.

12:38.933 --> 12:43.537
On the surface, everything seemed
terrific. Tromaville was safe,

12:43.600 --> 12:46.002
happy and prosperous.

12:46.066 --> 12:51.538
This period became known as ''The
Golden Age of Tromaville.''

12:52.600 --> 12:58.973
My mom was pretty proud of the fact
that everybody in Tromaville liked me.

12:59.033 --> 13:06.173
My mom was even prouder of the fact
that Claire, my non-seeing girlfriend

13:06.233 --> 13:12.505
who you remember in Toxic Avenger
Part Two, was now going to be my fiancee

13:12.566 --> 13:14.768
and live with me forever in Part Three.

13:14.833 --> 13:17.535
You got any change?

13:17.600 --> 13:21.537
Mommy's little Melvin had finally
grown up.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.536
Good day, Officer Lloyd.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.768
Yes, on the surface, everything
seemed wonderful.

13:26.833 --> 13:35.541
But deep inside of me were swirling
feelings of horrible insecurity.

13:35.600 --> 13:41.806
l was now twenty-five years old. But
who was l? What was l?

13:41.866 --> 13:48.305
Yes, l had rid Tromaville of all evil,
but now l had nothing to do.

13:48.366 --> 13:52.803
There weren't even any parking tickets
to give out.

13:52.866 --> 14:01.708
l, the Toxic Avenger, was reduced to
preventing old ladies from cheating at cards.

14:01.766 --> 14:04.301
Naughty, naughty.

14:04.366 --> 14:10.972
Or occasionally l found myself trying
o get naughty children to eat their lima beans

14:20.566 --> 14:26.638
l couldn't even get that right. Oh
brother. How low could a super-hero go?

14:26.700 --> 14:31.604
Claire and l were living in the same
old dump. l wasn't bringing in any money

14:31.666 --> 14:37.671
as a super-hero and l became a terrible
burden living off Claire's welfare check.

14:37.733 --> 14:40.535
Claire had a brilliant career going as
a dental hygienist

14:40.600 --> 14:47.206
and she was making very good money.
Until one day she had a tragic accident

14:47.266 --> 14:50.902
involving mouthwash rendering her
blind.

14:50.966 --> 14:54.269
Hi honey, l'm home.

14:54.333 --> 14:58.870
l think l'm losing my edge, Claire.

15:00.566 --> 15:08.307
Oh, Toxie, don't say that. If only that
Lavoris hadn't splashed in my eyes,

15:08.366 --> 15:12.236
l could see to help you. Aw, if l could
only see.

15:14.366 --> 15:21.773
Hey! Wait a minute. l don't believe
this. Wait a minute.

15:21.866 --> 15:26.537
You're gonna see. Dr. Ron Goldberg says
that your sight can be restored.

15:26.600 --> 15:32.372
Dear blind person, conditions caused by
retinitis pigmentosa

15:32.433 --> 15:36.937
found in association with the wide angle
glaucoma may now be successfully

15:37.000 --> 15:39.769
treated due to the modifications of the
argon laser.

15:39.833 --> 15:42.202
l can't believe it. l can't believe it.

15:40.600 --> 16:01.887
lt doesn't matter, Melvin. It's worth
anything.

15:42.266 --> 15:46.069
This procedure has been perfected on
cave bats.

15:46.133 --> 15:49.603
lt's been tested on them in labs and
fiRy percent of them lived.

15:49.666 --> 15:51.167
l can't believe it. l can't believe it.

15:51.233 --> 15:53.535
Uh oh.

15:54.566 --> 15:57.201
There's a catch.

16:01.899 --> 16:05.770
Three hundred and fiRy seven thousand
dollars?

16:05.833 --> 16:15.976
l actually thought l'd be able to see.
Oh well. It was a nice dream, anyway.

16:17.833 --> 16:24.005
l thought at last l was going to be
able to see my dear sweet Melvin.

16:25.399 --> 16:29.403
Gee...l'm not so sure you'd like what
you'd see.

16:29.466 --> 16:36.105
Oh Melvin, l iust know l would. You're
the nicest boy l ever met.

16:36.166 --> 16:37.934
l iust know you're handsome.

16:39.333 --> 16:42.035
What's the matter, baby?

16:42.566 --> 16:46.536
Nothing. l iust don't want to lose you.

16:47.799 --> 16:54.339
C'mon, we don't know this operation is
dangerous. And besides, at that price,

16:54.399 --> 16:59.538
it's only a dream unless l win the
_maville Times' Rich and Famous Sweepstakl

16:59.600 --> 17:06.873
l'm happyiust the way l am. l look at
it this way, l'll never have to see uglinesss

17:06.933 --> 17:14.540
or war or poverty or pollution or the
Cheverolet Nova.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.535
but it was a mess.

17:15.400 --> 17:21.172
No way. This time we're gonna get you
that operation 'cause l'm gonna get that job.

17:21.233 --> 17:25.470
You're going to get a iob and l'm going
to be able to see.

17:25.532 --> 17:30.838
Because of my love for Claire, l took
the only job available. The most horrifying

17:30.900 --> 17:33.535
and humiliating iob known to mankind.
l became a representative of

17:33.599 --> 17:36.803
the Internal Revenue Service.

17:36.866 --> 17:41.036
Hello, taxman's here.

17:52.633 --> 17:59.272
Oh. Ow. Stop it. Stop. Stop throwing
things. Cut it out. Watch out.

17:59.333 --> 18:04.938
Go back home. Go back to the iungle.
We got him.

18:06.500 --> 18:11.538
l tired moonlighting in the high tech
world of video cassette sales,

18:13.566 --> 18:17.202
Sir, here. l got the tapes you wanted.

18:17.266 --> 18:19.134
Oy vey. God in heaven. Every time you
touch the tapes, they melt.

18:19.200 --> 18:24.538
l told you a thousand times, don't touch
the tapes. Look what you've done.

18:24.599 --> 18:28.503
Shmuck, you're fired.

18:28.566 --> 18:32.503
My iob changing automobile mufflers was a
real bust.

18:32.566 --> 18:35.535
Let me reconnect these two little wires.
Hey, what's that smell?

18:41.633 --> 18:46.904
Since Claire and l were failing in the
material world, we decided to spend more

18:46.966 --> 18:52.571
time devoting ourselves to the spiritual
world.

19:03.533 --> 19:07.637
Amazine grace

19:07.700 --> 19:13.272
How sweet the sound

19:13.966 --> 19:18.537
That saved a wretch

19:19.000 --> 19:23.771
Like me

19:23.766 --> 20:10.946
kneel down and worship me#  '' Thus
endeth the lesson.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.537
l once was lost

19:30.599 --> 19:34.537
But now am found

19:35.000 --> 19:41.139
Do not be tempted by evil. The reading
for today is from Mathew four,

19:41.200 --> 19:47.773
verse eight and nine, and l quote. ''The
Devil taketh Jesus up to an

19:47.833 --> 19:54.406
exceedingly high mountain and showeth
him all the kingdoms of the world.

19:54.466 --> 20:24.529
And the Devil sayeth unto him, 'All these
things l will give thee if thou wilt

20:31.566 --> 20:38.539
l was so depressed and insecure that
l began having nightmares.

20:55.933 --> 20:59.836
Phoo! Where's my deodorant?

21:00.566 --> 21:07.472
Hi guy. Hey, you do stink. But that
_dorant's not going to help you. Remember m

21:07.533 --> 21:11.036
lt's Melvin, the way you used to be
before you fell into that toxic waste

21:11.099 --> 21:15.604
and became a hideously deformed creature
of super-human size and strength.

21:15.666 --> 21:19.169
Look at ya, ya bum. Ya can't even get a
job.

21:19.233 --> 21:24.304
l had a iob, even though l was a mop boy
at a health spa. Look at ya.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.900
Tromaville doesn't need you anymore.

21:25.966 --> 21:31.838
l betcha can't even get it up, can ya? l
betcha can't even get a woody.

21:31.900 --> 21:37.205
l could always get it up, even though l
was always alone. Give me a shot at Claire.

21:37.266 --> 26:35.563
l wanna boff her. C'mon man, c'mon.
Let me boff her and show you what

21:42.599 --> 21:43.600
a real man can do.

21:43.666 --> 21:48.437
Homo, wimp, geek. l oughta kill you.

21:54.766 --> 22:00.538
All these things l will give thee if
thou will fall down and work for me.

22:06.900 --> 22:11.904
Look at you. You can't get a iob. You're
a bum. You can't get a job.

22:11.966 --> 22:14.268
You can't get a iob. You can't get a iob.
You can't get a job.

22:14.333 --> 22:19.538
Let me boff Claire. Let me boff Claire.

22:33.533 --> 22:37.370
Melvin, what is it? What is it Melvin?

22:38.566 --> 22:41.035
Oh, it was horrible. It was horrible.
l couldn't stop falling.

22:41.099 --> 22:44.536
l iust kept falling and falling. l
couldn't stop.

22:44.599 --> 22:50.038
Oh, poor Melvin. You're very frustrated.
What can l do to relieve you, baby?

22:51.566 --> 22:52.533
Claire?

22:53.366 --> 22:54.533
Yes, Melvin?

22:54.633 --> 22:57.936
Where's my blanky?

22:59.200 --> 23:02.236
Right here, Melvin.

22:59.766 --> 24:05.698
My good news is that the newly formed
five families federeation has successfully

23:05.299 --> 23:09.537
l know it always makes you feel better,
Toxie.

23:36.500 --> 23:40.604
While my depression and insecurity led
me to experience unbelievably

23:40.666 --> 23:48.407
realistic nightmares, they were only
nightmares. But across the river,

23:48.466 --> 23:54.071
in the big city, there was a giant
_orporation called Apocalypse Incorporated,

23:54.133 --> 26:35.293
and it was creating a nightmarish
reality.

24:05.633 --> 24:13.540
used their drug network to sell
ioactive grenades to all the third world countr

24:18.566 --> 24:24.638
Our pilot program in the North Seas is
going well. We're dumping thirty tons of

24:19.066 --> 25:25.665
Well, we'll iust have to do away with
them.

24:24.700 --> 24:31.673
PCB's per week. And even better, we're
dumping seventy-five tons of radioactive

24:31.733 --> 24:38.539
isotopes per day in the Atlantic. An
excellent record.

24:39.866 --> 24:46.973
l am pleased to report that our profits
from the Above Land Subsidiary,

24:47.033 --> 24:57.643
is real good. And we are now pumping
massive doses of radiation high in the sky.

25:03.566 --> 25:15.244
Of course there are still some Sierra
Club sissies in Congress who are afraid of

25:09.933 --> 25:13.703
contamination up there in space. But
we all know that's baloney, right?

25:15.366 --> 25:16.533
Yeah, right!

25:16.733 --> 25:19.001
l think that at this point, if there's
anyone we still can't buy off.

25:31.566 --> 25:32.900
Good.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.034
Very good.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.100
Yes. Excellent.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.234
Thank you.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.134
Very impressive.

25:38.566 --> 25:43.237
for a bunch of rank amateurs!

25:45.566 --> 25:50.037
Who do you think you're talking to here?
l'm going for something

25:50.099 --> 25:57.841
bigger than that. Now, ever since we
Iost Tromaville to the Toxic Avenger,

25:57.900 --> 26:05.474
Apocalypse Incorporated has been
treading water, going nowhere.

26:05.533 --> 26:09.837
Am l getting through to you? Is there
something that's unclear?

26:09.900 --> 26:35.025
No.

26:11.633 --> 26:19.607
Good. Then it's settled then. You know
what l want ladies and gentlemen.

26:19.666 --> 26:25.538
Toxic Avenger. Delendus est.

26:36.566 --> 26:48.344
From this valley they say you
Ieaving. l will miss your bright eyes

26:48.400 --> 26:50.535
and sweet smile....

26:53.733 --> 26:58.204
Claire gave me an appreciation of her
most important hobby, music.

27:09.566 --> 27:13.536
And l gave her an appreciation of my
favorite pass-time...

27:13.599 --> 27:15.234
video games.

27:15.333 --> 27:20.371
And she learned to play very
skillfully by ear.

27:20.433 --> 27:24.236
Hey, Toxie baby. How's it hanging?

27:24.299 --> 27:30.239
See this new video game, Five Levels
of Doom?

27:30.299 --> 27:32.235
lt kicks!

27:38.200 --> 31:48.950
Meanwhile at the headquarters of
Apocalypse Incorporated

27:45.299 --> 27:47.235
the plot was thickening

27:47.299 --> 27:52.238
and l was to be the cornstarch.

27:54.566 --> 27:56.534
Silence!

27:58.566 --> 28:02.036
With all the evil, rotten, corrupt,

28:02.099 --> 28:05.203
despicably low people in the world,

28:05.266 --> 28:08.602
why is it so difficult for me to get
some help?

28:08.666 --> 28:11.602
Well..it's because...l mean...
l tried...to find

28:11.666 --> 28:13.934
Stop babbling, Malfaire!

28:14.000 --> 28:18.604
You better get the Toxic Avenger on
the payroll boss.

28:18.700 --> 28:23.504
We can work with that. With some
clever maneuvering,

28:23.566 --> 28:28.504
we can have this monster working on
our very own payroll.

28:28.566 --> 28:32.770
Have the legal department draw up a
contract.

28:32.900 --> 28:36.536
But how are you going to convince him
to work with us?

28:36.599 --> 28:42.572
No beast so fierce but knows a touch
of pity.

28:42.633 --> 28:45.602
He has a girlfriend, does he not?

28:45.666 --> 28:50.971
And that girl needs an eye operation,
doesnt she?

28:51.033 --> 28:53.535
Yeah

28:53.599 --> 28:59.539
Two eyes coming up.

29:17.133 --> 29:21.203
As my emotional tailspins spiralled
downward,these radioactive chemicals

29:21.266 --> 29:27.538
inside my body were going nuts.
Finally, l decided to end it all.

29:29.366 --> 29:33.603
Perhaps Claire could pick up a few
dollars by donating my body to science.

29:51.566 --> 29:55.036
But even at suicide i was a toxic
flop.

29:55.566 --> 30:01.571
Oh, Melvin. How could you even think
of taking your own life?

30:01.633 --> 30:05.603
l know. It's these chemicals. They've
taken over

30:05.666 --> 30:09.603
my life. What am i saying? l dont have
a life. l have

30:09.666 --> 30:18.307
a half-life. Whats to become of me, of
us?

30:18.566 --> 30:22.536
Don't talk like that Melvin. It scares
Me.

30:22.599 --> 30:30.541
Anyway, this came for you while you
were gone.

30:30.599 --> 30:33.536
lt smells important.

30:35.566 --> 30:39.703
lt's probably more bad news. They
probably want

30:39.766 --> 30:42.702
to repossess this dump. Here, you
read it.

30:43.066 --> 30:47.837
Ok. It says, uh, you iust won the
Nobel

30:47.900 --> 30:50.535
Peace Prize and the Tromaville
Times' Rich

30:50.599 --> 30:54.537
And Famous Sweepstakes and they're
going to

30:55.566 --> 31:02.839
give you your own Toxic Avenger
TV show.

31:03.566 --> 31:06.535
What? Give me that you crazy, silly
goose. Dear

31:06.599 --> 31:10.537
Out-of-Work Super-Hero. Great
opportunity?

31:10.599 --> 31:21.544
salary? Benefits out of this world?

31:21.599 --> 31:23.535
What is it, Melvin?

31:23.599 --> 31:27.537
lt's a iob opportunity. They want
me to

31:27.599 --> 31:30.536
represent their company and be their
spokesperson.

31:30.599 --> 31:31.600
l can't believe it.

31:33.299 --> 31:35.001
Claire, this is what l've been praying
for.

31:35.900 --> 31:40.537
l'm so exited. Look, l'd better
jump over there right now.

31:42.233 --> 31:48.205
But Melvin, you should put on a fresh
tu-tuuuuu....

31:48.566 --> 31:58.509
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman. The Toxic
Avenger's here. And his smelly mop

31:58.566 --> 31:59.566
is dripping all over our reception area.

31:59.633 --> 32:02.535
Melvin Junko?

32:02.599 --> 32:04.535
Yes sir, That's me, sir.

32:05.566 --> 32:08.368
Right on time. And you brought your
leSUMe.

32:08.599 --> 32:10.535
Uh, yes sir, right here.

32:11.566 --> 32:16.537
Health club mop boy, good. First
super-hero from New Jersey, even

32:16.599 --> 32:19.536
better. Special skill, leaping
relatively tall buildings with a

32:19.633 --> 32:22.535
running start and playing video games.
Fantastic, very impressive.

32:22.599 --> 32:25.536
Mr. Junko, we're looking for a special
person to be the spokesman for

32:25.599 --> 32:28.569
the Apocalypse Corporation. Someone
with charm, charisma and a

32:28.633 --> 32:31.602
nice appearance to act as spokesman
and spread the good

32:35.966 --> 32:37.701
Just what are your policies?

32:38.066 --> 32:38.066
Our policy, Mr. Junko. Giving, that's
our policy.

33:01.633 --> 33:05.570
Giving to the people what they need.
Fulfilling desires, Mr. Junko.

33:05.633 --> 33:09.503
That's what l've always done best.But
you ask yourself, how; it's

33:09.566 --> 33:12.201
iust words, but how do you do it? By
building,

33:13.233 --> 33:16.202
by growing,by taking small towns like
Tromaville and

33:16.266 --> 33:18.534
revitalizingthem into thriving industrial
metropolises.

33:19.066 --> 33:22.502
But l always thought Tromaville was nice
the way it was.

33:22.566 --> 33:32.208
But any place can be nicer. Everything
can be better.

33:32.266 --> 33:37.204
l mean, dont we all strive for more?
Don't you deserve more?

33:32.566 --> 33:48.548
And i can offer you wealh and... your
taste is something we can work on.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.533
Don't you deserve more? l'm a man of
wealth and taste.

33:48.599 --> 33:52.070
Melvin Junko, come on up!Look out
there, my boy.

33:52.133 --> 33:55.069
Let me show you your future. Ta-da.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.534
Toxic shock!

33:58.066 --> 34:04.539
No, no,no,no. No toxic shock. Just
your imagination set free.

34:04.599 --> 34:11.039
Look out there, Melvin. More than
you've ever dreamed of. A shining

34:11.099 --> 34:14.636
world with a Porsche in every driveway.
Chicken McNuggets in every pot.

34:14.699 --> 34:18.536
And you Melvin, smack dab in the middle
of it

34:18.599 --> 34:23.571
with more than you ever wished for.
Loved by millions the world over.

34:23.632 --> 34:27.536
You'll be more popular than the Beatles
and Elvis combined.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.534
That sounds like an awful lot on
minumum wage. l didn't say minimum wage.

34:30.565 --> 34:35.536
Who said minimum wage? Did l say
minimum wage? What hideously

34:35.599 --> 34:41.505
deformed creature of super-human size
and strength works for peanuts?

34:41.565 --> 34:44.568
Uh, none l guess.

34:45.632 --> 34:48.668
Melvy, your'e a star, bubullah.

34:48.733 --> 34:54.038
All these things l will give thee if
though willfall down and work for me.

34:54.400 --> 35:07.546
Where have l heard that before?

35:07.599 --> 35:09.535
Must be some sort of flashback from that

35:09.599 --> 35:12.502
lorn Maiden concert when i was fiReen

35:12.566 --> 35:25.612
No this is no flashback. Three hundred
nd fiRy-seven

35:27.666 --> 35:31.269
thousand dollars. And it's all yours.
Count it, boy. Smell it. l bet

35:31.333 --> 35:36.838
a smart boy like you could put it to
good use. Buy something

35:36.900 --> 35:39.469
nice for your girlfriend. Something she's
had her...eye on?

35:39.566 --> 35:45.204
:ould pay for her operation! You got a deal, IV

35:45.599 --> 35:59.347
And ,uh, we'll see you, uh, on Monday.
Oh, and uh, Melvin...

35:46.566 --> 35:50.636
Just sign on the dotted line, right here.

35:50.699 --> 35:54.537
Woops. Sorry the pen slipped. Welcome
aboard.

35:59.900 --> 36:01.534
Yes, Mr. Chairman?

36:01.599 --> 36:05.370
Get rid of that mop. It looks like hell.

36:39.566 --> 36:46.539
Here comes mommy, Melvin. Melvin it's
your mommy.

36:47.599 --> 36:51.203

36:51.566 --> 36:56.137
Wait a second. l'm on the bowl. l'll

36:58.566 --> 37:01.869
Darling, what's that smell?

37:14.566 --> 37:16.768
Whoo, stinks in here.

37:20.566 --> 37:25.504
Melvin, have you been eating properly?
You look mighty thin to me.

37:25.566 --> 37:29.136
Mom, never mind that, mom. Look at this.
l got my own business card.

37:29.199 --> 37:32.536

37:42.566 --> 37:42.966
Oooh, it's wonderful.

37:44.566 --> 37:48.536
And l almost forgot the best part.
The piece de resistance, the bank book.

37:49.633 --> 37:51.534
Your own bank book? What?

37:51.599 --> 38:20.028
Three hundred and fiRy-seven thousand
dollars? Oh, l don't believe it.

37:57.566 --> 38:02.370
And mom, feel the numbers. l had them
raised so Claire could feel them.

38:02.433 --> 38:05.369
Aw, you're such a darling boy. You're
so sweet.

38:05.566 --> 38:08.368
Now we can get Claire that eye operation

l love you mommy.

38:15.433 --> 38:18.369

38:22.433 --> 38:25.369

And miss your first day at work? Oh,
Melvin. It's ok.

38:28.400 --> 44:42.206
And a microwave oven for me. Aw, l'm so
proud of you darling.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.535
lt's iust going to be tests today, any
way. And l

38:32.599 --> 38:35.536
have the doctor and Mother Junko here.
It'll be ok.

38:37.400 --> 38:42.505
Thats's right, Mr. Junko. l'll take good
care of her.

38:42.566 --> 38:46.369
He's a wonderful doctor He's a member of
the country club.

38:48.433 --> 38:50.368
Are you sure you want me to go, Claire?

38:50.433 --> 38:53.369
Oh, Melvin. l love you.

38:53.566 --> 38:58.370
l love you too, Claire. And l'll be back
for the operation.

38:59.566 --> 39:05.371
Ladies and gentleman. You haven't waited
for nothing. Soon you'll

39:05.433 --> 39:15.509
be in the presence of a real leader. And
here he is. Right on time.

39:15.566 --> 39:21.538
And he's brought you a special surprise,
a new employee who you all

39:21.599 --> 39:25.570
know and love. Someone you and l can
trust and depend on.

39:25.633 --> 39:30.537
Someone who really knows how to clean
up this town.

39:30.599 --> 39:32.668
Hi everyone. Hi mom.

39:34.433 --> 39:38.370
Now citizens, the Chairman.

39:39.433 --> 39:46.373
Hello, how ya doin'? Hi, how are ya?
Hi people of Tromaville.

39:46.433 --> 39:53.540
Hi everybody.Hi mom. Hi everybody.
Look, l got a job.

40:02.566 --> 40:10.206
Mayor Cigarface, people of Tromaville.
Listen to me. Before you pass

40:10.266 --> 40:15.537
any quick iudgements, who are you going
to listen to? A bunch of whining

40:15.599 --> 40:20.538
enviornmentalists, who claim to be so
afraid of toxic waste, when we

40:20.599 --> 40:27.540
all know that waste is the natural
by-product of every organic process.

40:27.599 --> 40:34.540
Or are you going to listen to me?
The one who cares enough about you

40:34.599 --> 40:38.537
and your families to build you a new
and better Tromaville.

40:39.566 --> 40:42.535
No. Up yours, up yours.

40:42.599 --> 40:50.541
On so noble enterprise as this, a profit
there will be.

40:50.599 --> 40:58.307
Yes Ladies and gentlemen Dioxin means
dollars.

40:58.366 --> 41:03.537
Chemicals are cash. Say it to
yourselves.

41:05.599 --> 41:09.904
Hold it down, hold it down. Just
listen.

41:11.933 --> 41:13.934
He knows what he's talking about.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.069
l know that some of you out there
seem to think

41:17.133 --> 41:20.035
that chemicals are bad.

41:21.400 --> 41:25.604
l submit to you, you are chemicals.

41:26.666 --> 41:30.970
Everything is made of chemicals.

41:31.033 --> 41:37.739
And ioin me now in embracing dioxin
and all her sister chemicals

41:37.800 --> 41:41.036
and everything they represent.

41:41.599 --> 41:48.640
Happiness, prosperity, life.

41:48.699 --> 41:54.205
That, people of Tromaville, is the
Apocalypse way.

41:54.266 --> 41:57.869
On my first big day working for
Apocalypse,

41:57.933 --> 42:02.671
l was so excited about my good
fortune that l didn't notice

42:02.733 --> 42:05.102
that the Tromavillians were actually
hostile to the Chairman.

42:05.166 --> 42:11.038
Had l known then what l know now about
the evil excesses of capitalism

42:09.966 --> 42:15.438
lncorporated. But l didn't even read
Mad Magazine, much less Forbes

42:11.099 --> 44:41.783
and the power elite, l surely would
have never joined Apocalypse,

42:15.500 --> 42:21.906
or the Wall Street Journal. How was l
to know that the true agenda

42:21.966 --> 42:27.004
for Apocalypse, Incorporated was to
take over Tromaville and enslave

42:27.066 --> 42:29.902
its people?

42:32.199 --> 42:34.368
Let go of her.

42:41.366 --> 42:49.040
l have to admit, l did think it was
strange that the Apocalypse employees

42:49.099 --> 42:51.535
in the gas masks were beating my friends
senseless; and dragging

42:51.599 --> 42:54.836
away even my mother into rehabilitation
camps.

42:54.900 --> 42:59.971
But the chairman said that these were
the usual malcontents who turned

43:00.033 --> 43:04.303
for any cause or function; iust there
to interfere with progress.

43:04.366 --> 43:07.135
And l bought it hook, line and sinker.

43:09.566 --> 43:13.436
When my new company put the children to
work making agent orange

43:13.500 --> 43:17.470
and other chemicals, they told me it was
a wonderful thing

43:17.533 --> 43:20.869
because all the child ren would be earning
minimum wage.

43:20.933 --> 43:21.400
Besides, it would develop their small
motor skill. And they would really

43:27.466 --> 43:30.135
learn their primary colors.

43:34.599 --> 43:38.603
Come on. Get up. Get up.

43:45.833 --> 43:49.336
So you think this is going to be the new
home for the blind, do ya?

43:49.400 --> 43:54.104
Well, you're wrong. This is the new nerve
gas dump site.

43:58.199 --> 44:00.502
Looks great. Better go check out our
boy.

44:03.633 --> 44:05.668
How's he doing?

44:05.733 --> 44:07.034
Ok.

44:07.099 --> 44:09.602
Not so heavy.

44:09.666 --> 44:12.201
There you go.

44:12.266 --> 44:14.434
Be careful.

44:16.400 --> 44:19.770
One of my responsibities was to get the
Tromavillian's

44:19.833 --> 44:23.036
to ioin the Apocalypse, Incorporated
Self-lmprovement Seminars.

44:26.133 --> 44:31.438
l did everything l could to help these
volunteers find their way

44:31.500 --> 44:34.269
to the right classrooms.

44:34.333 --> 44:37.936
That's it. Stay in line.

44:42.933 --> 44:48.138
Apocalypse, Incorporated had me doing a
little bit of everything.

44:49.766 --> 44:51.267
Move it.

44:51.333 --> 44:54.102
Tear down these crummy homes.

45:01.266 --> 45:03.067
Thanks potato head.

45:03.133 --> 45:04.067
Bye bye.

45:04.133 --> 45:06.335
Why don't you nail that sign down the
block.

45:24.466 --> 45:27.802
Nurse, would you dispose of this please.

45:27.866 --> 45:29.167
Of course doctor.

45:32.133 --> 45:33.601
Melvin Junko? Melvin?

45:35.633 --> 45:37.601
Yes Claire. l'm here.

45:37.666 --> 45:38.600
Doctor?

45:38.666 --> 45:40.768
l'm over here Claire, relax.

45:40.833 --> 45:41.867
Mother Junko?

45:41.933 --> 45:43.401
l'm here dear.

45:43.466 --> 45:44.466
Melvin?

45:44.533 --> 45:45.600
Yoo-hoo.

45:45.666 --> 45:50.971
Claire, nothing to be afraid of. You're
going to be seeing all those

45:51.033 --> 45:53.001
wonderful things soon. Just hold very
still.

45:53.066 --> 45:55.134
l don't want to poke your new eyes out
with these scissors.

45:56.699 --> 45:59.369
Hold very still. l'm getting there.

46:01.599 --> 46:04.035
Just another moment.

46:04.433 --> 46:08.103
Keep your eyes closed until l tell you to
open them.

46:13.833 --> 46:16.802
Open your eyes very slowly, that's it.

46:27.533 --> 46:30.402
Melvin it's too horrible.

46:30.466 --> 46:34.703
No Claire, calm down. Melvin is over
there.

46:47.333 --> 46:48.967
Melvin?

46:49.966 --> 46:54.770
Melvin. Melvin, you're beautiful.

46:54.833 --> 46:57.702
Claire. You can see. You can finally
See.

46:57.766 --> 47:03.605
l can see. This is the happiest day of
my life. Oh Melvin. Oh, darling.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.736
No l want to see everything.

47:58.366 --> 48:02.603
So this is your big, beautiful love
machine.

48:02.666 --> 48:07.670
Yes. That's one of the advantages of
being a hideously deformed creature

48:07.733 --> 48:10.202
of super-human size and strength.

50:15.866 --> 50:21.605
When this land-fill is created, it will
be the largest chromium waste dump

50:21.666 --> 50:23.601
within a thousand miles.

50:23.833 --> 50:30.306
The Toxic Avenger is one of Apocalypse's
most promising young executives.

50:34.933 --> 50:37.402
Well done, Melvin.

50:51.566 --> 50:54.302
Melvin! l made your favorite breakfast.

50:54.466 --> 50:59.838
Radioactive oatbran. Melvin. Melvin?

51:00.699 --> 51:03.602
Melvin! Your breakfast is ready, sweetie.

51:05.500 --> 51:06.567
Heey. No time babe.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.703
Anyway, l gotta do an egg with the chairman
this morning!

51:11.699 --> 51:16.905
Like wow, look at this. Waste Vacuum's
up three pointers.

51:17.566 --> 51:18.433
Huh?

51:22.533 --> 51:26.536
Hey, hey. Don't be so glum. Soon it's
the weekend.

51:28.166 --> 51:30.535
We'll do brunch. What are you gonna do
this morning, babe?

51:31.199 --> 51:33.168
Well, l thought l'd take a nice long
walk...

51:33.233 --> 51:35.668
...and go over and see the
environmentalists.

51:36.233 --> 51:39.202
They want me to help them save the
Tromaville
bird santuary.

51:41.533 --> 51:46.738
But Melvin, what kind of talk is that?
Do an egg. Do Brunch.

51:49.599 --> 51:51.068
That doesn't sound like New Jersey talk
to me.

51:51.666 --> 51:56.404
Hey, hey, hey, hey. That's upwardly
mobile lingo, ya know?

51:58.566 --> 52:00.000
But listen, l gotta go, go, go!

52:00.599 --> 52:03.169
So, like he said, ok. S'ok? OK. So
listen, l got to go.

52:04.233 --> 52:08.870
Oh. Kisses and hugs. Remember, you
gotta go, go, go!

52:09.599 --> 52:12.069
Heh, hey. Yeah! Oh, l gotta check
_O=11=10,02=OO=19=09,There it is. There it is! It

52:15.633 --> 52:18.769
Bye-bye. Heh, heh, heh, heh.

52:19.033 --> 52:25.639
Babe? Do an egg? Waste Vacuum? Mmm.

52:35.366 --> 52:36.333
Can you believe it?

52:36.599 --> 52:37.534
l don't know.

52:40.000 --> 52:40.767
Oh my God!

52:41.566 --> 52:43.567
Hey girls. What's up? Hey, hey. Give
Me SOMe.

52:43.933 --> 52:49.538
The worst of it was poor Claire. The
operation opened her eyes

52:49.599 --> 52:51.601
iust in time to see her beloved
Tromaville overrun

52:51.666 --> 52:58.005
with the parasites of corporate greed and
the vermin of political corruption.

52:58.099 --> 52:58.233
Huh!

52:58.533 --> 53:00.534
And l was the cause of it.

53:01.966 --> 53:02.833
C'mon over here.

53:03.533 --> 53:05.201
How much will it take to get both of you
off the street? Go.

53:06.599 --> 53:09.102
What's going on here? Hey you hookers.
Get out of here.

53:09.566 --> 53:10.433
Lousy pimp.

53:10.599 --> 53:12.768
Leave this young man alone. Whaddya think
your doin' here!

53:22.566 --> 53:25.468
Vomit break. Vomit break.

53:25.566 --> 53:27.935
C'mon. Puke or die, you bastards.

53:28.233 --> 53:32.003
Get it up. Let's go. C'mon. Wheel out
that stomach.

53:32.599 --> 53:36.537
C'mon, c'mon. Alright. Tromavillian
Aaaah. Go Home, puke,

53:36.599 --> 53:39.169
come back in 20 minutes. l don't want
to see anybody without puke stains.

53:41.033 --> 53:44.603
Before l knew it, l'd become a toxic
yuppie on the fast track.

53:50.599 --> 53:52.401
The Tromavillians tried to put on a brave
face, and made the best

53:52.466 --> 53:53.433
of their mutated environment.

53:54.433 --> 53:58.970
But what does one feed to a creature that
is half frog and half duck?

53:59.566 --> 54:01.868
Worse yet, what would you call it?

54:09.566 --> 54:11.701
Listen. Listen! l don't care if she's 80.

54:11.766 --> 54:13.501
lf she doesn't have the rent at the end
of the month,

54:13.566 --> 54:21.140
l want her out of there. Larry,
buballah, baby! How are ya?

54:21.566 --> 54:23.868
Melvin. l want to talk to you.

54:24.300 --> 54:26.268
Can't it wait, l'm on the phone.

54:26.566 --> 54:27.566
No.

54:27.633 --> 54:30.769
Well, l gotta go. Claire's being a nudge.
Ah, yes.

54:35.599 --> 54:39.603
Melvin, something's very wrong. This
company you're working for,

54:40.566 --> 54:42.034
l think they're doing evil things

54:43.000 --> 54:44.201
Don't be silly.

54:44.566 --> 54:48.336
You've changed so much, lately. You seem
so different.

54:49.599 --> 54:52.035
you're iust not yourself, lately.

54:52.633 --> 54:55.736
Well, yes, but...How could you badmouth
apocalypse?

54:56.566 --> 54:58.601
l mean, c'mon. If it wasn't for them,

54:59.300 --> 55:00.401
you would still be stumbling around on
that cane.

55:01.566 --> 55:08.673
l know, but l'd rather be blind in heavan
than sighted in hell.

55:09.566 --> 55:10.900
Tromaville's being destroyed.

55:12.699 --> 55:14.835
And all you can do is listen to executapes
morning, noon and night.

55:15.566 --> 55:19.870
Melvin, l think someone is trying to
brainwash you.

55:20.599 --> 55:24.203
l don't have to listen to this garbage.

55:25.566 --> 55:29.903
You iust remember, l signed that
contract for YOU!

55:32.933 --> 55:35.769
And l gave up my blindness to see you
get involved in a plot

55:35.833 --> 55:37.968
to pollute the world!? Hah!

55:38.566 --> 55:41.535
What about all the people that counted
on you to clean up evil?

55:43.966 --> 55:48.970
What about all those people in reel 9
of the first movie who stood up for you

55:49.566 --> 55:54.537
What about the messengers, Melvin?
You're their hero.

55:55.566 --> 55:58.535
What about all those marvelous people
out there in the dark?

55:59.266 --> 56:00.734
What about your favorite patriots,
Melvin?

56:01.933 --> 56:04.535
ls life so dear, or peace so sweet

56:04.699 --> 56:06.768
as to be purchased at the price of
slavery?

56:07.599 --> 56:11.537
l know not what course others may
choose. But as for me,...

56:12.566 --> 56:15.435
Give me liberty, or give me death!

56:17.566 --> 56:20.001
l'm outta here.

56:20.599 --> 56:24.403
Just walk out the front door and turn
your back on humanity.

56:34.933 --> 56:37.235
Phooey on you, toxic traitor.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.068
Boo, toxic bad guy.

56:40.566 --> 56:42.134
Pick on Donald Trump.

56:42.300 --> 56:45.102
Why don't you go out to Exxon.

56:50.699 --> 56:55.304
l felt that my whole world was caving
in around me.

56:55.566 --> 57:00.003
: to my favorite place to sit and think, the iun_

57:00.533 --> 57:03.402
Coming to this place had always comfor
ted me.

57:03.533 --> 57:09.272
But now, the old cars, the headlights
were staring at me.

57:09.566 --> 57:12.902
The grills were grinning and mocking
Me.

57:13.833 --> 57:18.103
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

57:19.766 --> 57:26.939
$351,OOO. It's all yours. Ha, ha,
ha, ha.

57:28.699 --> 57:32.537
$351,OOO for you. Ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha.

57:33.599 --> 57:38.771
Oooh, ooh, oh, ooooh.

57:44.966 --> 57:47.868
All these things....

58:17.033 --> 58:18.234
Let me boff Claire....

58:25.133 --> 58:28.102
We won't rescue you...Let me boff
Claire.

58:35.933 --> 58:45.575
$351,OOO. Ha, Ha, Ha. $351,OOO.
Ha, Ha, Ha. $351,OOO.

59:02.000 --> 59:09.173
All this can be yours!! If you will
work for me!

59:10.566 --> 59:16.271
All this if you will fall down and
worship me!

59:20.599 --> 59:24.937
Wait a minute! You said worship me.
You said worship me!

59:25.566 --> 59:29.636
Not work for me. Where have l heard
that before?

59:30.066 --> 59:35.805
All these things l will give thee if
thou wilt kneel down

59:36.133 --> 59:36.533
and worship me!

59:38.566 --> 59:43.537
OH, NOOOOOOOO!

59:48.566 --> 59:54.571
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

01:00:06.833 --> 01:00:11.070
How could l have thought l was helping
Tromaville?

01:00:11.633 --> 01:00:18.339
How could l have been so deluded? Oh,
l can't believe it.

01:00:20.266 --> 01:00:27.039
Claire was right. What've l done?
Have l sold my soul?

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:31.803
What've l become? l'm evil.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.669
What can l say to make it up to her?

01:00:43.333 --> 01:00:44.567
Can't believe it.

01:00:57.866 --> 01:01:10.445
Claire, Claire, Claire, Claire. Wake
up. Wake up.

01:01:11.866 --> 01:01:14.969
Melvin, what's wrong? You're shaking.

01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:19.335
Don't worry. l'll be alright.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.036
l think your eye operation has helped
me to see.

01:01:24.766 --> 01:01:30.171
You were right. Apocalypse is evil.
They do horrible things.

01:01:30.866 --> 01:01:33.668
l've got to stand up and fight them.

01:01:33.833 --> 01:01:36.535
But how? How are you going to do that?

01:01:36.599 --> 01:01:41.604
Well, the sumos taught me that when you
face a formidable opponent,

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:43.533
you must make the first move.

01:01:44.733 --> 01:01:49.904
l'm so proud of you, baby. But how will
you fight apocalypse?

01:01:52.866 --> 01:02:03.009
How will l fight them? How will l fight
them?! How will l fight them?!!!

01:02:04.666 --> 01:02:06.834
The old fashioned way, that's how!

01:02:07.366 --> 01:02:07.799
Oh, Melvin!

01:02:08.666 --> 01:02:12.803
Well, that's the whole, horrible,
terrible truth.

01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:14.233
What a mensh!

01:02:17.666 --> 01:02:21.636
But now l was ready to make amends.

01:02:21.699 --> 01:02:24.936
Now l was ready to show the good
people of Tromaville

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.370
that they could look up to me once
again as their very own,

01:02:28.566 --> 01:02:32.770
newly reformed, hideously deformed,
super-hero.

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.001
But first l had to earn their respect.

01:02:36.699 --> 01:02:41.504
As quick as my two feet would take me,
l was out there giving my toxic all.

01:02:41.566 --> 01:02:44.302
The Toxic Avenger is coming.

01:02:44.666 --> 01:02:46.200
Melvin is back.

01:02:54.266 --> 01:02:55.800
The Toxic Avenger's back

01:02:56.566 --> 01:02:58.467
The Toxic Avenger's coming.

01:02:58.533 --> 01:03:00.468
Melvin, bbbbbb.

01:03:06.566 --> 01:03:08.234
Thank you for saving my dog. Toxie.

01:03:08.599 --> 01:03:10.435
Here's your doggie, good citizen.

01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:27.304
Helping to undo all the horrible wrongs
committed during my descent

01:03:27.466 --> 01:03:29.234
into the Chairman's clutches.

01:03:29.566 --> 01:03:33.436
But now, l was ready to confront the
evil chairman on his own turf.

01:03:33.599 --> 01:03:35.935
l would mop up the evil in Tromaville

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.068
and make room for ''The Toxic Avenger
Part Four!''

01:03:53.933 --> 01:04:00.839
Aah, my new assistant. Still carrying
that mop l see.

01:04:01.599 --> 01:04:05.804
Here to clean up the new headquarters?

01:04:06.566 --> 01:04:08.834
Ha, ha, ha...

01:04:09.266 --> 01:04:10.066
Here to clean 'em out!

01:04:10.133 --> 01:04:16.372
Ho, ho. It was a ioke! Melvin,
Melvin, Melvin. What's wrong?

01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:19.001
l thought, uh, we were partners.
You and l had a deal, hm?

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.735
Toxic Avenger doesn't deal with evil.

01:04:23.866 --> 01:04:27.269
Well, well. l think our boy knows
something.

01:04:27.533 --> 01:04:30.002
l think l know who you are!

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:33.302
A contract is a contract.

01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:36.468
And you're a man of your word.

01:04:36.633 --> 01:04:40.603
Right, Melvinnnnn!

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.634
l don't care about your dumb contract.

01:04:47.066 --> 01:04:49.201
We want you out of Tromaville.

01:04:52.699 --> 01:04:57.604
Good citizens of Tromaville,
Apocalypse is through.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.035
Chairman, you're history.

01:05:04.266 --> 01:05:10.071
Yes, Melvin. l am history.
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

01:05:09.566 --> 01:05:10.533
What's happening? Oh my God,
Iook at that!

01:05:11.666 --> 01:05:13.467
Oh, you still don't realize who
you're dealing with, do you?

01:05:21.333 --> 01:05:30.475
See me as l AM! _GHHH!

01:05:32.566 --> 01:05:33.533
Stay back. Stay back.

01:06:39.466 --> 01:06:41.467
l'm totally confused.

01:06:42.466 --> 01:06:44.467
Oh! The Devil.

01:07:25.633 --> 01:07:29.169
You are one ugly amphibian.

01:08:02.066 --> 01:08:06.069
Alright, Junko. Let's party.

01:08:27.733 --> 01:08:30.702
No problem. l meant to do that.

01:08:31.466 --> 01:08:34.468
What will it be? Dark places?

01:08:34.533 --> 01:08:39.638
Magic swords? Choose your weapon
and your arena.

01:08:40.466 --> 01:08:43.100
Oh, l know.

01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:46.935
You play video games, don't
you Melvin?

01:08:47.866 --> 01:08:52.502
l'm going to show you the Five
Levels of Doom.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.470
Earth, wind, water and the
Iast one...

01:09:01.066 --> 01:09:05.470
but nobody gets to the last
one anyway.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.634
The let the battle begin.

01:09:11.698 --> 01:09:15.370
Ready or not, here we go!

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.234
Level One. Earth.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:05.072
This is one load of toxic waste that
won't stay buried.

01:10:07.399 --> 01:10:11.237
Get him. l'll give you a thousand
dollars to run that guy over.

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:15.871
Wait, the budget for this movie's
only two million.

01:10:15.933 --> 01:10:19.469
Thirty! l'll give you thirty dollars

Nice work, Mevlin.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.470
But now, we're up to level two.

01:12:05.533 --> 01:12:08.869
A personal favorite of mine...

01:13:47.266 --> 01:13:53.205
Your friends save you. But can you
save your friends?

01:14:02.433 --> 01:14:05.702
Oh, see the little children getting
on the school bus.

01:14:05.766 --> 01:14:10.036
lt's fun and games time.

01:14:15.666 --> 01:14:20.470
Don't make a fuss. Leave the driving

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.202
All aboard.

01:14:32.766 --> 01:14:34.901

Thank you Melvin.

01:19:15.399 --> 01:19:16.768

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.568
The witch is dead.

01:20:19.199 --> 01:20:22.202
Oh my God the Devil is fixing the bus.

01:20:25.199 --> 01:20:26.634
He's putting it back together again.

01:20:58.033 --> 01:21:04.873
You may have leR Malfaire flat. But
now you will perish, Avenger.

01:21:09.166 --> 01:21:12.435
This next level of doom is a doosie.
Water.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.135
Stop that bus.

01:21:20.033 --> 01:21:21.601

01:21:22.733 --> 01:21:24.000
You devil you.

runaway school bus

01:23:11.733 --> 01:23:17.171

muddy, murky water.

01:23:18.699 --> 01:23:22.870
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me, people. Get out
of the way.

01:23:22.933 --> 01:23:26.536

Tromaville.

01:23:27.066 --> 01:23:31.203
You are becoming an annoying horsefly.
But swatting time is here.

l bring you, courtesy of hell

01:23:37.433 --> 01:23:40.035
the final level of doom.

Oh, what's the matter, Melvin? Got a
headache?

01:25:18.899 --> 01:25:21.969
Losing weight the easy way, Melvin.

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:31.770
Pull yourself together, Mevlin.

01:25:42.233 --> 01:25:45.536
Oh, no. Oh Toxie.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:57.436

Here's your Sumo diaper. Put it on.

01:26:55.366 --> 01:26:59.536
Maybe this will help you. Remember what
your sumo friends taught you?

01:27:08.466 --> 01:27:12.369
Oh, little Melvin. You don't even know
where you are.

01:27:14.433 --> 01:27:17.736
Are you in Tromaville? Are you in
Japan? Where are you?

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.703
Oh look. Oh look. Little Mevlin.
Your girlfriend wants to help.

01:27:49.699 --> 01:27:54.805
Oh! Oh my God! l'm blind.

01:27:55.433 --> 01:27:59.069
l'm blind again.

01:28:31.666 --> 01:28:34.135
Melvin, Melvin.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.403
lt's your mother.

01:28:44.766 --> 01:28:48.636
What are doing to her?

01:28:47.699 --> 01:28:52.337
ARer all, a boy's best friend is his
mummy.

01:28:54.033 --> 01:28:57.936
lf only l could find that contract.

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:56.100
Oh, if l could find that contract then
maybe l could help Melvin.

01:29:00.866 --> 01:29:05.303
l don't know where he put it.

01:29:03.366 --> 01:29:08.037
lf l could iust find the contract then
we could clean this this thing up.

01:29:08.533 --> 01:29:10.534
Get out of my way, worm.

01:29:13.833 --> 01:29:17.870
Look. Look at him. Look what's become
of the Toxic Avenger.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.037
He's back to the sniveling mop boy you
all made fun of.

01:29:25.399 --> 01:29:59.867
Where's that brail version of the
contract Toxie made for me?

01:29:28.866 --> 01:29:33.604
lf l could iust find that contract,
then we could clean up this mess.

01:29:35.399 --> 01:29:38.136
That's it.

01:29:50.033 --> 01:29:54.837
Ah, look. Isn't he ready for
destruction?

01:29:53.899 --> 01:29:58.037
Aren't you tired of this pink
tutu'd pansy?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.204
We're tired of you, Mr. Chairman!

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:16.238
And ve're tired of vat you're company
is doing to our Tromaville!

01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:19.570
We're tired of ground water pollution.

01:30:19.633 --> 01:30:23.136
And your sludge.

01:30:23.199 --> 01:30:25.535
And the PCB's!

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:30.171
We're tired of your filthy lawyers and
accountants and we're fed up

01:30:30.233 --> 01:30:34.604
with your perverted investment bankers.

01:30:34.666 --> 01:30:39.604
The Toxic Avenger has always played fair
with us.

01:30:39.666 --> 01:30:43.603
And he's the only toxie waste we need
around here.

01:30:41.966 --> 01:30:45.769
This town has never had it so good.

01:30:43.666 --> 01:30:47.603
lf you want him, you've gotta go
through us first!

01:30:45.833 --> 01:30:50.804
l order you to go back to your hovels
and jump in your beds.

01:30:50.866 --> 01:30:55.503

this

01:30:55.566 --> 01:30:58.535
and let you show up for work tomorrow.

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:03.069
Please let us through.

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.469
Claire has found a way out of the
contract.

01:31:05.533 --> 01:31:09.503
Excuse me. She's found an escape
clause.

01:31:10.366 --> 01:31:13.335
Claire has found a way out.

01:31:13.433 --> 01:31:16.402
Oh, oh my God. There's an escape
clause.

01:31:17.866 --> 01:31:20.835
You, you tell them about it.

01:31:19.666 --> 01:31:21.634

And God is in the hearts of the
people.

01:31:48.433 --> 01:31:51.402
lt's and escape clause.

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:55.536
What about this? It's an escape
clause, see? What about it?

01:31:57.566 --> 01:32:03.071
So where is he? On vacation in the
Grand Bahamas?

01:32:02.833 --> 01:32:07.804
l don't see him around protecting
his interests.

01:32:07.866 --> 01:32:11.803
l'm the only one interested in this
dirty little town.

01:32:12.033 --> 01:32:15.002
And you're yesterday's waste, pal.

01:32:21.533 --> 01:32:24.502
Excuse me, excuse me.

Can't you see we're busy here?

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:35.470
l think this takes priority.

01:32:34.333 --> 01:32:36.301
No one takes priority over me.

01:32:37.699 --> 01:32:39.668
OH!

01:32:44.933 --> 01:32:47.902
Well, maybe one.

01:32:54.033 --> 01:32:57.002
Let's get the hell outta here.

01:33:02.666 --> 01:33:05.635
lt's the big guy. Let's get out of
here.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.468
Claire. Claire.

01:33:09.766 --> 01:33:12.735
Madonna mia. Gott in himmel. Was

01:33:17.866 --> 01:33:18.833
lt feels tingly on my body.

01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:23.269
lt's nectar from God.

01:33:22.866 --> 01:33:25.835
lt's some healing liquid.

01:33:25.899 --> 01:33:28.869
lt's sweet. It's soR. It's warm.

01:33:29.533 --> 01:33:33.503
What's happening little Melvin?
What's happening?

01:33:40.199 --> 01:33:44.170

Melvin your back.

01:33:48.533 --> 01:33:51.502

01:34:11.366 --> 01:34:13.334
Oy gevalt?

01:34:12.733 --> 01:34:16.703
l think it's about time that somebody
put the fear of God in you.

01:34:17.033 --> 01:34:21.003
Be reasonable. Think of what you're
giving up, Melvin.

01:34:21.066 --> 01:34:25.036
That's Mr. Melvin to you!

01:34:27.666 --> 01:34:31.636
This is more disgusting than General
Hospital.

01:36:40.266 --> 01:36:42.234
Are you ok?

01:36:43.833 --> 01:36:46.802
Up you go reverend.

01:36:58.266 --> 01:37:02.236

01:37:13.066 --> 01:37:17.036
Then l now pronounce you man...

01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:21.037
uh, monster and wife. You may now kiss
the bride.

01:37:35.866 --> 01:37:38.835
Oh, my baby boy.

01:38:02.933 --> 01:42:00.803
So me and mommy and Claire walked off
