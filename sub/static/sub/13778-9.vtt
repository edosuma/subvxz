WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.333
(Hanni El Khatib's
"You Rascal You" playing)

00:06.882 --> 00:09.123
Oh! Oh!

00:09.176 --> 00:11.667
Yes! Yeah!

00:11.720 --> 00:13.085
All right, all right. I admit it.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.253
Epstein's better
than I thought he'd be.

00:14.306 --> 00:15.591
Uh,yeah.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.757
He's the reason 15's
gonna own 27.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.266
— 100 bucks.
— 27 is a superior division.

00:20.312 --> 00:21.802
— I'll bet you anything.
— 100 bucks.

00:21.855 --> 00:22.970
— 100 bucks.
— Yeah.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.559
100 bucks.
You guys shut up, please.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.151
(Chris) Dude,
you were unreal today.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.812
(Dov) Nah, it's——it's nothing.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.072
I took a couple lessons to get ready.
It's no big deal.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.655
No big deal?
You were on fire out there.

00:37.704 --> 00:41.242
You're like the urban cowboy...
on fire.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.872
— Right?
— (Dov groans)

00:42.918 --> 00:44.203
Come on.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.959
— And it's the first day.
— (groans as door slams)

00:46.004 --> 00:49.292
I mean, most of us couldn't even
get up on the horse the first day.

00:49.341 --> 00:52.549
You're gonna fly
through this training, bro.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.585
All right, come on.
We're here. Let's go.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.003
Oh, I just gotta
get my stuff together.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.466
What stuff?

00:57.516 --> 00:59.848
You know, my things, my stuff.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.269
Okay.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.186
Go ahead. l'll catch up to you.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.017
(groans)

01:07.568 --> 01:09.934
_ Wh——
— Nothing. It's nothing.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.235
l——l think I tweaked my back
a little bit on that last jump,

01:12.281 --> 01:13.737
but... I'm fine.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.068
VVemisitbad,
er,hospﬂalbad?

01:16.118 --> 01:18.074
No. No, it's...

01:19.580 --> 01:21.696
Yeah, it's bad.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.785
J‘ When they bring your dead body in J‘

01:24.876 --> 01:29.370
J‘ I'll be glad when you're dead,
you rascal, you J‘

01:29.423 --> 01:31.539
So any cute boys at horse camp?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.298
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
I don't care.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.626
I'm over cops,
completely over them.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.131
I would have thought
it'd be the perfect time

01:37.222 --> 01:38.302
to get right back up on that horse.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.926
No, I want to be alone right now.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.966
(chuckles)
Andy McNally, lone wolf?

01:42.060 --> 01:43.220
So?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.056
— | get it. I like it.
— All right.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.220
(Dov) Ladies.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.104
— Hey.
— How's the back?

01:48.150 --> 01:50.641
Back's fine.
It's my heart that's broken.

01:50.736 --> 01:51.725
You know how long
I've been looking forward

01:51.778 --> 01:53.484
to this mounted unit training?

01:53.572 --> 01:55.733
Yeah, I'm surprised they cleared
you to get back out on shift.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.942
Oh, no, |'m——|'m fine.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.734
It's just a lateral muscle sprain.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.869
No big deal. As long as I take
a couple of these every few hours,

02:02.914 --> 02:04.120
I'm good to go.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.908
Just... no cantering for a while.

02:08.754 --> 02:10.790
The reins go to the horse's mouth,

02:10.839 --> 02:12.045
but Western, the reins go over——

02:12.090 --> 02:13.796
Really? I mean, come on.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.424
It's like I'm not already
having a crappy enough day?

02:16.470 --> 02:18.131
Chris was just teaching me

02:18.180 --> 02:20.762
the difference between
riding Western and English.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.388
What, were you taking notes yesterday?

02:22.434 --> 02:23.970
Yeah. I mean...

02:24.019 --> 02:26.010
Dov really wouldn't know,
because he's too busy

02:26.063 --> 02:27.974
popping pills and icing his back.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.854
Thanks,babe.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.015
You're quiet.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.604
So? Arrest me.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.526
She is not feeling the love today.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.652
That's my thing.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.325
All right, guys.
We're gonna be late.

02:39.368 --> 02:40.574
We should probably get to Parade.

02:40.619 --> 02:41.984
Hey, do you want me
to call wheel—trans?

02:42.037 --> 02:43.117
No, it's okay.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.369
I'll just take your broomstick.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.154
(slap on
back
Ohh! )

02:46.208 --> 02:47.789
— Callaghan.
— Hey.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.370
Kirkus trial. (clears throat)

02:49.419 --> 02:51.831
Evidence box 9 of 26.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.211
Wow. If these get too heavy,

02:53.256 --> 02:54.996
give us a holler. I'll call you a rookie.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.415
Yeah, thanks.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.004
And lift with your legs.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.293
Right.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.553
You know what?
Hey, hey. Come here.

03:01.598 --> 03:05.307
Hey. I got something I want to run
by you, all right? Something personal.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.217
I say go for it, brother.
Shave that back.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.262
Ass. You're an ass.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.772
Where to start? Where to start?

03:12.818 --> 03:17.027
How about the mounted unit
training report, day one?

03:17.072 --> 03:18.027
Happy?

03:18.073 --> 03:19.313
Yeah.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.779
Don't be.

03:22.828 --> 03:25.410
Says here,
"Your rooks showed up nervous,

03:25.497 --> 03:28.910
"rode tight,
came generally unprepared.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.867
The candidates from 27 Division
fared far better."

03:31.920 --> 03:34.252
— Sir, if——if I might——
— Skip it, Epstein.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.830
You're the only one
who got a decent report.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.384
— (grunts)
— Now you all might think

03:38.427 --> 03:41.134
that this mounted training is no big deal,

03:41.179 --> 03:43.966
special skill to pad your resume,

03:44.015 --> 03:45.801
but I went to bat for you on this,

03:45.851 --> 03:48.934
told them that I had 3 rookies from 15

03:49.020 --> 03:50.521
who was worth their time.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.607
Look at the person next to you.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.231
For a second, if you will.
Go ahead.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.023
All of you.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.658
That is the person
who deserves your very best.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.789
And I expect much better
from you today.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.417
Moving on.

04:14.463 --> 04:18.251
Detective Callaghan
is prepping the Kirkus trial.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.087
Officer Williams testifies
tomorrow morning.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.672
Now the rest of you,
get out there.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.799
Do your best,
because that's what we do.

04:24.848 --> 04:25.803
Yes, sir.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.089
(Oliver) You all right? Epstein?

04:27.142 --> 04:28.678
Officer Williams, you got a sec?

04:32.814 --> 04:35.146
You may be the best rookies
downtown has to offer,

04:35.192 --> 04:36.807
but you don't know squat
about horses,

04:36.860 --> 04:39.317
and that's all
that matters to me.

04:39.362 --> 04:43.321
So hit your stalls, tack up,
and let's learn how to ride.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.614
Of course I don't know squat
about horses.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.654
What's that guy's problem?

04:50.707 --> 04:51.992
You want me to ask him?

04:52.042 --> 04:53.532
No, I don't want you to ask him.

04:53.627 --> 04:57.211
I swear, this job attracts power—tripping,
insecure control freaks.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.664
Not you.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.833
(sighs) Hey, guy.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.673
I swear, Diaz. I don't know
how you get any work done, man.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.303
Don't even try, Samuels.
I'm off cops.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.635
Aw, shucks. I should have pounced
back at the Academy

05:09.684 --> 05:10.719
when I had my chance.

05:10.769 --> 05:11.975
You never had a chance.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.681
I love you. (chuckles)

05:13.730 --> 05:15.937
Well, at least I get to hang out
with my buddy Diaz over here.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.064
I've been trying to get together
with this guy for ages,

05:18.109 --> 05:20.816
but then my best old friend here
gets a girlfriend and——

05:20.862 --> 05:23.274
Oh, not just a girlfriend,
a Peck.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.608
— Hey.
— Whoa.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.818
(horse snorts)

05:25.867 --> 05:27.152
Seriously, man.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.908
Nobody's ever been such a good friend.

05:28.954 --> 05:29.909
You know that.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.913
Dude. (chuckles)

05:32.958 --> 05:34.619
It's just so good to hang out
with you again, man.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.080
— Dude, right? Yes!
— Yeah, man. Yeah! Pah!

05:37.128 --> 05:38.117
(Samuels) Remember,
remember, remember?

05:38.171 --> 05:39.672
(blows) Booyah!

05:39.714 --> 05:40.965
— (imitates gunfire)
— Bang! Bang!

05:41.007 --> 05:42.292
— Ay, yi, yi, yi!
— Wow.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.672
(clears throat) Uh, what?

05:46.721 --> 05:49.383
Screw horse camp.
This is what I love right here——

05:49.432 --> 05:51.889
the open road,
serving, protecting.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.391
Picking up losers all day long.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.687
I happen to enjoy my job.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.516
(dispatcher on radio) S—1, attend
1582 Spadina for a bomb threat.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.148
Female caller said there's a bomb
in the restaurant kitchen.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.525
ETF is on scene.
Request units for backup.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.731
1519 on it.

06:03.822 --> 06:04.982
(siren wailing)

06:05.031 --> 06:06.316
Sweet. Things are looking up.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.233
Oh, right, 'cause you get to see
your new girlfriend Betty Bombsquad?

06:09.327 --> 06:11.158
You know what? There's a lot
you could learn from Sue, okay?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.320
She's fearless, courageous, hilarious,

06:13.373 --> 06:15.409
and she doesn't have a clove of garlic
where her heart's supposed to be.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.410
Oh, really? 'cause there's
actually a couple things

06:16.501 --> 06:17.911
you can learn from Chris.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.334
Well, I guess we're both
with the right people.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.335
Yeah, I guess so.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.872
(siren whoops,
indistinct conversations)

06:27.345 --> 06:29.210
(Dov) Traci Nash flying solo.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.596
— Yeah, I like it. It's nice and quiet.
— Oh, lucky you.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.264
All right, so I need you guys
to keep everyone

06:33.351 --> 06:35.262
— outside the perimeter.
— You find anything yet?

06:35.353 --> 06:37.765
| just got here. Cleared it,
but we still have to sweep.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.222
— Could be a swatter.
— What the hell is a swatter?

06:40.275 --> 06:41.731
Someone who calls in
a fake bomb threat

06:41.776 --> 06:44.188
to see his awesome girlfriend
in action.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.193
So what, we still don't know
if there's a bomb in there?

06:46.239 --> 06:49.026
Some woman called it in,
tried to, uh, block the number.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.407
Took our binary guys about
five seconds to crack it. Here.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.489
Mary Vu, 1290 Carlaw.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.527
All right, let's go.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.038
Oh, if you don't mind,
|'||, uh, steal Epstein here.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.369
I could use him on scene.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.408
Keys.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.879
Hey, looks like I'm riding with you.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.507
Yeah, so much for quiet and nice.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.169
Officer Williams? Noelle?

07:11.222 --> 07:13.213
Noelle, you got a minute?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.557
How's it going?

07:16.603 --> 07:19.390
Uh, trial prep——it's——it's——it's good.
It's going good.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.475
No, I'm talking about
the whole baby thing,

07:21.524 --> 07:23.230
the wanting to have one, the IVF?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.562
Everything's fine.
Thanks for asking.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.619
Okay.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.448
Noelle...

07:35.497 --> 07:37.738
You know, I think
we should talk about this.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.619
— You do, huh?
— Yeah.

07:40.669 --> 07:41.658
Well, I don't.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.542
Got it.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.082
(crowd speaking Cantonese)

07:49.135 --> 07:51.592
Ma'am, how many times
do l have to tell you?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.845
No more pictures, please.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.972
(camera shutters clicking)

07:56.017 --> 07:58.394
Seriously? Oh.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.301
(woman) See you smile, ah?

08:01.898 --> 08:03.434
A——A bomb threat?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.098
Call was traced to your cell phone.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.311
It wasn't me.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.065
Oh, so you're saying your phone
called all on its own, ma'am?

08:09.114 --> 08:10.650
I don't even know where it is.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.276
Someone must have stolen it.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.236
(cell phone ringing)

08:14.285 --> 08:16.742
So someone stole your phone,
called in a bomb threat,

08:16.788 --> 08:18.528
and then put it back in your pocket?

08:18.581 --> 08:19.957
Guess so.

08:20.000 --> 08:20.955
Don't test me.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.161
I'm not afraid of you.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.162
Well, you should be.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.333
Well, I'm not.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.999
What do you say, Officer Nash,

08:28.091 --> 08:31.003
we take her back to the station
and find out the whole story?

08:31.094 --> 08:32.925
— I'll meet you on the street!
— Do it!

08:39.436 --> 08:41.552
Mary!

08:41.604 --> 08:43.105
(Gail) I got her!

08:44.441 --> 08:46.898
Mary, hold up! Hey!
(handcuffs clicking)

08:46.943 --> 08:48.353
If you want to arrest me, go ahead!

08:48.445 --> 08:49.560
l have nothing to say to you!

08:49.612 --> 08:52.228
What is going on here?

08:52.282 --> 08:53.988
Seriously, Mary, what's going on?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.116
l have nothing to say to you.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.912
Mary, you gotta tell us
what you know.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.122
Is there a bomb
in that restaurant or not?

09:07.213 --> 09:09.374
— l have to pee.
— Not gonna work.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.960
| just took you five minutes ago.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.757
— What do you want from me?
— The truth!

09:12.802 --> 09:14.258
It's the easiest thing to remember.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.465
Why did you call in a bomb threat?

09:17.599 --> 09:20.636
That restaurant is a known hangout
for gang activity, okay?

09:20.727 --> 09:22.763
If you are connected,
we're gonna find out.

09:24.147 --> 09:27.810
I worked there for six months
washing dishes.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.483
The owner never paid me a cent.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.106
I want to get back at him.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.270
You're lying.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.946
You're scared.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.235
You don't know me.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.949
No, but I do know what it's like

09:41.998 --> 09:44.410
to be acting all tough
when really you're terrified.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.335
You can trust me, okay?

09:51.674 --> 09:54.632
Mary, you can trust me.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.128
(door release buzzes, beeps)

09:58.181 --> 10:01.514
(clears throat)
That is a surveillance photo

10:01.601 --> 10:03.182
taken at David lng's wedding,

10:03.269 --> 10:05.305
Shangri—la Banquet Hall,
two months ago.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.017
This is Officer Swarek.
He works in our Guns and Gangs unit.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.269
That's you, Mary, uh, cuddling up to——

10:10.318 --> 10:11.433
I'm guessing that's your boyfriend——

10:11.486 --> 10:14.853
and you guys are sitting next to Tommy Chan,
crime boss of Wah Ching.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.155
— l have to pee.
— Well, fire away.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.610
You won't be the first person
to go in here,

10:18.660 --> 10:21.367
and when you're all done, you're gonna
tell me how you know Tommy Chan.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.995
Can I speak to you a minute,
Officer Swarek?

10:25.041 --> 10:26.542
(door release buzzes, beeps)

10:33.049 --> 10:35.540
I think I can get her to talk.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.503
With all due respect, sir,
I was building a rapport.

10:39.556 --> 10:40.841
(cell phone chimes and buzzes)

10:45.395 --> 10:49.013
Epstein says the restaurant's clear.
No bomb.

10:49.065 --> 10:52.649
All right, you want to start with finding out
why she called in a hoax, please?

10:52.694 --> 10:53.854
That, I can do.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.776
All right, here's how it goes.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.816
On the whistle,
you mount your horse,

11:00.869 --> 11:02.700
weave through the slalom course,

11:02.745 --> 11:04.781
place your cup of water
on the second pole

11:04.831 --> 11:06.071
without spilling a drop.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.615
You got it?

11:08.668 --> 11:09.783
All right, McNally, you're up.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.121
(blows whistle)

11:13.256 --> 11:14.962
I can't wait to see McNally trot.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.464
(horse snorts)

11:16.509 --> 11:18.465
(Instructor) Eyes fonNard.
Find a spot for your turn.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.047
— Yeah.
— Head up!

11:20.096 --> 11:22.303
J‘ Meet the night, babe J‘

11:22.348 --> 11:24.964
J‘ Oh, God, come alive J‘

11:28.062 --> 11:30.189
J‘ You've been lyin' J‘

11:30.231 --> 11:32.187
— J‘ Lyin' and cheatin' J‘
— (horse snorts)

11:32.233 --> 11:33.894
J‘ Cheatin' and breakin'... J‘

11:33.943 --> 11:35.194
Next.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.357
Dude, you are
so going down out there.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.771
Pfft! In your dreams, Edmonton.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.906
— Ah, Edmonton!
— (laughs)

11:41.951 --> 11:44.158
Just like the old days, brother,
back at the academy.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.865
Diaz. Samuels.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.450
Are you nervous?

11:47.498 --> 11:49.284
Nah, man, compared to
what I've had to go through,

11:49.334 --> 11:50.744
this is a friggin' holiday.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.249
Why, man? What's, uh——
What's going on?

11:52.295 --> 11:54.661
— Diaz!
— Looks like you're up, man.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.124
Work your magic, brother.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.163
All right, come on.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.959
— Whoa. Hey.
— (snorts)

12:00.011 --> 12:02.673
All landed immigrants from
Hong Kong the last five years.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.178
Are these just the men?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.135
Whoa, whoa. Wait.
Go back a photo. Let me see him.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.470
— (Gail) That guy?
— Yeah.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.306
There's no record of him.
He's not even a known associate.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.471
We need a name.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.519
(cell phone chimes)

12:17.195 --> 12:19.607
Sue Tran. Drinks with ETF.
Do | go?

12:19.656 --> 12:21.317
Why wouldn't you?

12:21.407 --> 12:23.944
Uh, because she's like
"The Hurt Locker."

12:23.993 --> 12:25.244
I'm a rookie cop.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.153
Dov, if you stayed home every single time
someone was cooler than you,

12:28.206 --> 12:30.413
you'd be like one of those ladies
from "Grey Gardens."

12:30.458 --> 12:33.416
Stop trying to be all Swarek
about everything.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.793
You might as well just tell her
how you feel about her.

12:39.634 --> 12:40.623
Bingo.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.089
We got a match.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.932
I know you don't think so, but...

12:48.977 --> 12:51.184
you can talk to me, Mary.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.434
I mean, sometimes it's easier
to talk to a stranger.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.643
You gotta think of it like...

12:56.693 --> 12:57.808
confession.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.441
(knock, door release buzzes, beeps)

13:01.489 --> 13:02.604
This is Officer Epstein.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.818
You've already met Officer Peck.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.524
Coffee.

13:06.577 --> 13:07.987
Oh, you made me run after you.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.288
I am not getting you a coffee.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.992
No, it's just... the smell.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.781
(Sam) Kenneth Chan——

13:13.835 --> 13:15.666
arrived from Hong Kong two years ago,

13:15.712 --> 13:18.954
sponsor Bo Chan,
relationship——great—aunt.

13:19.007 --> 13:22.499
Mary, what can you tell us
about your boyfriend Kenneth?

13:22.552 --> 13:24.884
He ask you to make that call?

13:24.929 --> 13:26.760
Can she put the coffee outside?

13:26.806 --> 13:27.841
The smell is——is——

13:27.890 --> 13:29.676
You're pregnant.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.932
Always having to pee.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.513
Supersonic sense of smell.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.642
I should've known.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.513
And Kenneth is the father.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.851
Mary?

13:41.904 --> 13:44.737
He not like his family, all right?

13:44.782 --> 13:48.115
But his cousin Tommy
always pressuring him,

13:48.161 --> 13:49.651
"Come. Work for me."

13:49.704 --> 13:52.195
Kenny always say no,

13:52.248 --> 13:54.409
but when I told him about the baby,

13:54.459 --> 13:55.995
he says we need the money.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.659
(Sam) Right.
The gangster with a heart of gold.

13:57.712 --> 13:58.997
Where have I heard that story before?

13:59.047 --> 14:00.207
Maybe from every girlfriend

14:00.256 --> 14:02.087
of every banger I've ever met.

14:02.133 --> 14:05.250
So, sorry if we don't empathize.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.927
I don't care!
| telling the truth.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.678
Last night, he tell me.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.090
He says I can't tell anyone.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.555
He going to work for his cousin,
join the gang.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.811
So why would he make you
call in a bomb threat

14:16.856 --> 14:18.517
to a rival gang's restaurant?

14:18.566 --> 14:19.976
He didn't!

14:20.026 --> 14:21.266
I just——

14:21.361 --> 14:23.101
| just want to buy some time,

14:23.196 --> 14:25.903
shut the place down,
convince him not to do it!

14:25.948 --> 14:27.859
Do what, exactly?

14:29.410 --> 14:31.992
Wah Ching initiation.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.029
Tonight at the restaurant,

14:34.082 --> 14:35.697
he going to kill someone.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.662
The Wah Ching, Chinese gang.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.127
Huge in the late seventies,
early eighties.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.459
Chinese immigrants
who'd come over from Hong Kong

14:47.512 --> 14:49.628
with nothing to lose,
and these are their kids,

14:49.680 --> 14:51.841
Wah Ching's second generation.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.802
Gangbanging
is all they've ever known.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.508
All right, and that makes them
even more dangerous.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.893
Tommy Chan here,
he's now the acting Dai Lo.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.305
— The boss?
— Yeah. You speak Cantonese?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.016
No, sir. You just put him
at the top of the pyramid.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.980
— Oh. Yeah.
— All right, listen up.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.860
Two weeks ago, a truck carrying

15:06.906 --> 15:09.522
200 grand worth of Wah Ching
merchandise was hijacked,

15:09.575 --> 15:11.190
probably by a rival triad.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.529
Is it heroin? Opium?

15:12.578 --> 15:14.318
Counterfeit designer watches.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.909
Sell for 30, 40 bucks a pop
in Chinatown.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.536
Look, Kenny Chan's hit

15:19.585 --> 15:21.667
has to be retaliation
for the truck robbery.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.577
If we don't pick him up,
someone gets shot.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.083
All right, so Officer Swarek and me——

15:25.174 --> 15:27.381
we're gonna cruise Chan's regular haunts.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.840
Peckstein, the aunt who sponsored him
sells ginseng in Chinatown.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.264
You're gonna go and have
a little chat with her.

15:32.348 --> 15:35.840
And, Nash, since you built a rapport
with the girlfriend,

15:35.893 --> 15:36.723
get her discharged.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.225
— On it, sir.
— All right.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.227
We've got about four hours
to find this garbage

15:40.273 --> 15:42.013
and get him off the street
before he shoots somebody.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.397
Okay, let's do it.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.432
— Epstein.
— Yeah?

15:44.527 --> 15:45.767
That's my line.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.237
Great to see Samuels, huh?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.194
Not really. What happened
with you guys anyway?

15:52.243 --> 15:54.279
I mean, you guys were inseparable
at the Academy.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.407
Uh, yeah. I don't know——
hours, different divisions.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.742
lguess.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.122
Officer McNally,
can I speak to you, please?

16:00.209 --> 16:01.710
Yep.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.208
(lowered voice)
If I'm not back in 10...

16:03.254 --> 16:04.710
Okay.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.707
(exhales deeply)
McNally in riding pants.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.135
God, I love myjob.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.590
— (chuckles) Yeah.
— I really do, you know that?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.629
— I love being a cop.
— Me, too.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.718
It's all I ever wanted, dude.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.429
So, uh——So what's going on?

16:19.479 --> 16:20.844
Ah, nothing, really. lt's...

16:20.897 --> 16:22.433
Nah, come on, man.
Maybe I can help.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.688
(horse neighs)

16:23.733 --> 16:25.348
Well, a few weeks ago,
I was riding solo,

16:25.401 --> 16:26.902
back end of a 10 out of 12.

16:26.944 --> 16:30.186
l was up at least 30 hours straight.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.275
Fell asleep at the wheel, brother.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.065
Wrapped my cruiser around a pole.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.074
Are you serious?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.532
I mean, a—are they investigating?

16:38.581 --> 16:41.197
Well, yeah, you know, standard stuff——
how fast I was going,

16:41.250 --> 16:42.581
you know, how many shifts
I worked in a row,

16:42.627 --> 16:43.582
was alcohol a factor?

16:43.628 --> 16:45.038
— Was it?
— No.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.497
God, no. Dude,

16:46.547 --> 16:48.833
I learned my lesson
from last time, man.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.590
But they are looking
into my past record.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.051
Yeah, I know.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.758
I know.
Long time ago, right?

16:56.807 --> 17:00.766
But the thing is,
someone is, uh, supposed to call you.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.188
— What?
— Dude.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.438
Come on, man.
It was me and you in the car.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.605
You were the only other guy there.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.853
Who else are they gonna call, man?

17:08.903 --> 17:11.064
And you gave a sworn deposition, so...

17:11.113 --> 17:12.523
Look, are you asking me
to lie for you again?

17:12.573 --> 17:14.029
No, but I'm saying

17:14.075 --> 17:16.111
maybe we should just stick
to the same story.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.568
You know what, man?

17:18.621 --> 17:21.237
It's just been so great
hanging out with you.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.030
|——You know what?
I'm sorry I just——

17:23.084 --> 17:25.541
I'm sorry I even brought this up.
I mean, this is——

17:25.586 --> 17:27.451
I feel an obligation
as your best friend to tell you,

17:27.547 --> 17:28.707
give you a heads—up, you know?

17:28.756 --> 17:30.257
They probably won't even call.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.255
Don't worry about it. It's good.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.091
— (cell phone chimes)
— Me?

17:37.139 --> 17:39.266
(chuckles) No. God, no.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.094
— Me.
— (police radio chatter)

17:41.143 --> 17:43.634
Aw! "Miss you.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.438
Wish you were here.
XOXO, Chris."

17:47.483 --> 17:49.895
There's a man who doesn't hide
his feelings.

17:49.944 --> 17:50.933
Yeah.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.602
(pills rattle)

17:52.655 --> 17:53.815
What does that mean?

17:53.906 --> 17:54.816
(mouth full) Mm. Nothing.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.647
No, no. He's, uh...

17:56.742 --> 17:58.073
Dude's my best friend, all right?

17:58.119 --> 18:00.576
It's just he's not exactly complex.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.612
Are you calling my boyfriend simple?

18:02.665 --> 18:05.657
No, I'm calling him amazing.
He's got such a big heart.

18:05.710 --> 18:09.043
You know, he's like a big,
uh... border collie.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.800
(cup thuds)

18:19.682 --> 18:21.968
Officer McNally,
you're riding a horse,

18:22.018 --> 18:23.258
not playing the accordion.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.972
Well, how am I supposed
to hold the reins?

18:25.021 --> 18:26.636
— How I told you.
— How did you tell me?

18:26.689 --> 18:28.600
By opening my mouth
and making words come out.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.685
Wow. Why are you being such a jerk?

18:30.735 --> 18:33.477
Honestly, I mean, this is supposed
to be fun, you know,

18:33.529 --> 18:34.985
riding horses out in the fresh air.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.397
This is supposed to be a break from drugs

18:37.450 --> 18:39.657
and domestics and dead bodies.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.067
Where was your last homicide?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.235
— When or where?
— Where.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.698
Jane and Finch.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.285
Last week, the corridor
in front of the sub shop?

18:46.334 --> 18:47.619
— You worked that?
— Yeah, I did.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.954
Us, too. After you left,

18:50.004 --> 18:52.245
when everybody was too afraid
to come out of their houses.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.663
What do you mean?

18:53.716 --> 18:55.923
I rode up there with a few guys,

18:55.968 --> 18:59.301
and the kids ran out into the street
to see the horses.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.338
Their parents came, too.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.596
People returned to the streets,

19:02.642 --> 19:05.304
which makes the neighborhood safe.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.934
I'm from that neighborhood.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.264
(horse neighs)

19:08.314 --> 19:09.770
People don't trust cops.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.101
But these animals,

19:12.151 --> 19:14.767
these horses,
they humanize us.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.111
| just love this unit a lot.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.570
Did I really look like
I was playing an accordion?

19:21.619 --> 19:23.735
A really big one, very badly.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.198
(chuckles)

19:25.289 --> 19:26.870
(Anya Marina)
J‘ Semester is out J‘

19:26.957 --> 19:28.493
J‘ Uh—huh, uh—huh J‘

19:28.542 --> 19:30.203
J‘ The teacher is in J‘

19:30.294 --> 19:31.795
J‘ Uh—huh, uh—huh J‘

19:31.837 --> 19:33.668
J‘ There ain't no exams J‘

19:33.714 --> 19:36.922
J‘ But, oh, you better bet
you're gonna learn somethin' J‘

19:36.967 --> 19:38.753
J‘ Uh—huh, uh—huh J‘

19:38.803 --> 19:40.543
J‘ So get in the van J‘

19:40.638 --> 19:42.094
J‘ Uh—huh, uh—huh J‘

19:42.139 --> 19:44.004
J‘ And pay all your dues J‘

19:44.058 --> 19:45.844
J‘ Uh—huh, uh—huh J‘

19:45.893 --> 19:47.849
J‘ And stay a while J‘

19:47.895 --> 19:50.637
J‘ Yes, stay in the spirit school J‘

19:50.690 --> 19:52.430
(Instructor) 22 seconds flat.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.519
Nice work, McNaIIy.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.650
— Thank you.
— J‘ Uh—huh, uh—huh J‘

19:56.696 --> 19:58.857
J‘ Uh, uh—huh, uh—huh J‘

19:59.949 --> 20:01.940
(helicopter hovering)

20:04.245 --> 20:06.236
All right, listen, brother, that thing
that I wanted to run by you——

20:06.288 --> 20:08.540
— Yeah, right, the personal matter.
— Don't say it like that, though.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.617
— What? What did I say?
— "Personal matter."

20:09.667 --> 20:11.658
You make it sound like I can't
hoist the sail or something.

20:11.752 --> 20:12.912
— You can't hoist the sail?
— No, listen.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.702
That is not what I'm
talking about here, okay?

20:14.755 --> 20:15.995
I got the opposite problem.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.126
When Zoe and I got married,
she made three rules.

20:18.175 --> 20:21.008
She said that if I stuck to the rules,
we'd have no problems.

20:21.095 --> 20:21.925
All right?

20:21.971 --> 20:23.177
There is no hard drugs.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.595
There is no head spins,
no strippers.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.971
No head spins?
What are head spins?

20:26.016 --> 20:27.802
I did some break dancing
in my teens, my early 20s.

20:27.852 --> 20:28.716
You never did any break dancing.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.010
That's not the point.
That's not the point.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.437
Price's retirement dinner
last weekend...

20:33.482 --> 20:35.063
Yeah, I was there.
What about it?

20:35.109 --> 20:36.599
Yeah, no, after the dinner,
some of the boys

20:36.652 --> 20:38.188
moved the party over to Jilly's.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.102
Oh, strippers.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.942
Not, "Oh, strippers."
This is the first time——

20:41.991 --> 20:42.980
— Hey, hey.
— What?

20:43.033 --> 20:44.944
First time in 14 years of marriage

20:44.994 --> 20:46.655
that I ever broke one of her rules.

20:46.704 --> 20:47.864
— All right.
— Okay?

20:47.913 --> 20:50.529
Now this is my question:
Do I tell her?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.414
I don't know.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.085
Yes, 100%. Tell her.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.334
Good. Okay.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.839
— All right.
— Thank you, brother.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.008
— You're welcome.
— (Oliver sighs)

21:03.053 --> 21:04.634
(pats shoulder)

21:04.680 --> 21:06.181
Let's go get some dim sum.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.212
Sure.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.800
Mmm. Mmm.

21:10.853 --> 21:13.060
Hot water with lemon? You okay?

21:13.147 --> 21:15.183
It's for a girl we brought in.
She's pregnant.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.644
The hoax bomb threat.
And she's still here?

21:17.693 --> 21:19.399
Yeah, papenNork is taking forever.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.106
Right.

21:21.155 --> 21:24.864
She did it to protect
her sad—sack boyfriend

21:24.950 --> 21:27.327
from making a terrible mistake.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.325
Sam doesn't believe her either.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.827
What, you do?

21:33.375 --> 21:34.785
Well, then you go with that.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.450
I mean, the whole time
we've been dating,

21:36.504 --> 21:38.665
your instincts have
only been wrong once.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.875
Medieval Times?

21:40.966 --> 21:41.876
Yep.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.548
How was that not fun?

21:43.636 --> 21:44.876
We got to swill mead.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.962
You're a good cop
with good instincts.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.551
— (pats shoulder)
— Trust that.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.183
— Milady.
— (door release beeps)

21:54.313 --> 21:57.350
One hot water with lemon.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.687
Thank you.
It's all I can stomach.

22:00.736 --> 22:01.896
You kidding?

22:01.987 --> 22:04.524
I lived on ginger tea and arrowroot.

22:04.573 --> 22:05.608
You have a kid?

22:05.658 --> 22:08.320
Yeah. I have a son. He's seven.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.404
You look great.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.239
Hmm. Well, you know,

22:11.288 --> 22:13.199
it helps when you have them
in high school.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.989
High school?

22:15.042 --> 22:16.782
It's okay. It's not a secret.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.122
Not anymore.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.287
Your husband, he a cop, too?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.955
I don't have a husband.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.792
So you raise him on your own?

22:25.845 --> 22:28.177
Pretty much, yeah.

22:28.222 --> 22:30.178
My mom helps out a lot, though.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.014
My mom in China.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.347
Well, still, she must be pretty excited.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.605
I can't be part of this.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.235
I agree.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.988
I can't bring a kid into that.
I know.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.240
(cell phone beeps)

22:55.040 --> 22:58.373
Your papenNork
has come through, Mary.

22:58.419 --> 22:59.579
You're free to go.

23:02.506 --> 23:03.666
Come on.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.502
I'm gonna give you a lift.

23:06.594 --> 23:07.629
Okay?

23:09.013 --> 23:10.594
It was, like, ten minutes ago, man.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.924
I swear to you. I saw him myself.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.510
And you're sure it was Kenny Chan?

23:13.601 --> 23:15.512
He was leaving
that nightclub, Fluid.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.013
Go check it out, man.
He can't be far.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.686
All right. Don't buy drugs.

23:19.773 --> 23:20.762
Thanks, Sammy.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.854
So what do we think Kenny Chan is doing

23:24.945 --> 23:28.938
in the entertainment district
at 4 PM. on a Tuesday afternoon?

23:29.033 --> 23:31.194
Picking up a piece, maybe.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.653
Maybe he's picking up a piece.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.568
Restaurant?

23:34.622 --> 23:35.782
Sounds good. Let's go.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.531
(shifts gear)

23:38.584 --> 23:39.699
That way.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.583
(both laugh)

23:41.712 --> 23:44.374
Here, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.382
Here, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny.

23:50.012 --> 23:52.173
We got a 20 on Kenny Chan.
We think he's armed.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.178
I need you and Epstein
outside his apartment

23:54.224 --> 23:55.384
in case he shows up there.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.265
— Roger that.
— Stake out the apartment.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.767
Like anything is gonna happen there.

23:58.812 --> 23:59.767
Please.
(siren wailing)

23:59.813 --> 24:00.802
Are you okay?

24:01.815 --> 24:03.351
Always the bridesmaid,

24:03.400 --> 24:05.061
never the bomb squad.
(chuckles)

24:05.110 --> 24:06.941
What are you babbling about?

24:06.987 --> 24:09.774
Shh. Not so loud.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.109
l have very small listening cones.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.027
What is wrong with you?

24:16.080 --> 24:17.661
Nothing.
(pills rattle)

24:17.706 --> 24:20.573
Dov? Dov, how many of those
have you taken?

24:20.626 --> 24:22.742
Excellent question,
Officer Peck.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.002
Not one I can answer,
but excellent question.

24:25.047 --> 24:27.538
Oh, my God. You're totally
stoned right now.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.331
Dov, we're on duty,

24:29.385 --> 24:30.921
and we're trying to find
an armed gangster,

24:30.970 --> 24:32.335
and you're higher than a kite.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.879
Here, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.577
(Traci) Okay.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.337
Home sweet home.

25:09.383 --> 25:12.170
Uh, I will call you as soon
as we know anything.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.880
Okay?

25:13.971 --> 25:14.881
You all right?

25:14.972 --> 25:16.132
— I'm fine.
— Okay.

25:17.307 --> 25:18.638
But, uh...

25:18.726 --> 25:20.887
would you mind
just staying for a bit?

25:21.979 --> 25:23.970
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.020
|'m, uh, at the end of my shift,

25:26.066 --> 25:29.558
and my kid's with his dad
tonight. So...

25:29.611 --> 25:30.987
Do you have ginger?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.486
Yes.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.486
Honey?

25:33.532 --> 25:34.396
Yes.

25:34.450 --> 25:35.815
— Lemon?
— Yes.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.285
Okay, why don't you take a seat?

25:37.327 --> 25:38.988
I'll make you some of
that famous ginger tea.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.825
(pills rattle)

25:42.916 --> 25:44.702
(Gail) I can't believe
you're stoned on duty.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.538
I took the right dose.

25:46.587 --> 25:49.875
Must be having an adverse reaction.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.834
Yeah, you and me both.

25:51.925 --> 25:54.667
Be cool, Gail. Be cool.

25:54.762 --> 25:55.797
Shut up.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.382
You have any five—cent candies?

25:57.431 --> 25:59.012
You know what?
Actually, keep talking,

25:59.058 --> 26:01.014
'cause I'm gonna tell
your girlfriend

26:01.101 --> 26:04.013
every little thing you said
next time she comes over

26:04.063 --> 26:05.849
to watch one
of her stupid dancing shows.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.763
I love that she watches
stupid dancing shows

26:07.858 --> 26:09.894
even though she can't dance.

26:09.943 --> 26:14.277
I love that she's pretty
and funny and smart,

26:14.364 --> 26:18.903
pretty much the most incredible
girl that I've ever dated.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.283
The only thing wrong with her...

26:20.370 --> 26:22.531
She's dating an idiot
for a boyfriend

26:22.581 --> 26:24.082
who's higher than a lab monkey?

26:24.124 --> 26:25.455
No.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.918
The only thing wrong with her

26:26.960 --> 26:28.370
is that she's not you.

26:29.797 --> 26:30.752
What?

26:30.798 --> 26:33.756
I mean, if she was you

26:33.801 --> 26:36.258
or if I was Chris,

26:36.303 --> 26:38.009
l'd believe in luck of the soul,

26:38.055 --> 26:40.171
the possibility of anything.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.680
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:41.725 --> 26:44.102
And I'd marry you. I would.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.178
Mm—hmm.

26:47.231 --> 26:48.562
And we'd open our presents

26:48.649 --> 26:51.061
on Christmas morning,
not Christmas Eve.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.813
And I'd take a desk job.
I'd hit 50.

26:53.862 --> 26:56.695
I'd lose my hair, my mind,

26:56.740 --> 26:59.527
listen to jazz,
embarrass our kids.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.907
Our kids,

27:00.953 --> 27:03.319
with their straw—colored hair...

27:04.456 --> 27:06.572
and your eyes.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.746
And I'd wake up every morning

27:10.796 --> 27:15.961
and wonder at my dumb,
dumb, dumb luck.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.169
(kiss)

27:22.558 --> 27:23.843
If I was Chris.

27:37.281 --> 27:38.942
(indistinct conversations
in Cantonese)

27:38.991 --> 27:40.106
Yo, yo, yo. Come here!

27:40.159 --> 27:41.695
(Oliver) Why is the place empty?

27:41.743 --> 27:43.358
(siren wailing nearby)

27:43.412 --> 27:45.403
Plenty of room to shoot somebody?

27:45.455 --> 27:46.706
Maybe.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.197
Oh.

27:50.711 --> 27:52.201
Red star hoodie.

27:52.254 --> 27:53.710
Thank God for gang symbols.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.501
(Oliver) Kenny Chan,
stop where you are.

28:00.554 --> 28:03.796
On your knees.
Hands where I can see them.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.017
Wrong guy, Sam. Get up.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.314
— Good evening, officers.
— Tommy Chan.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.187
I believe you're looking
for my cousin Kenny.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.648
You can search all you want.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.934
You won't find anything.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.148
Shut up.
Check his texts and his calls.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.688
Turn around. Put your hands
behind your back.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.606
Last text was two minutes ago.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.032
— What's it say?
— lt's Cantonese.

28:24.077 --> 28:26.068
I don't know.
You can, uh, speak Cantonese?

28:26.121 --> 28:27.952
No? You? Yeah?
Can you translate this for me?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.029
What does this say?

28:29.082 --> 28:30.822
"It's her. Mary is the leak."

28:30.876 --> 28:31.956
(Oliver) Huh? Mary?

28:32.002 --> 28:33.617
"Mary is the leak"?

28:33.670 --> 28:34.625
That's Kenny's girlfriend.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.208
She called in the bomb threat.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.708
There wasn't gonna be a hit.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.303
It was a test.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.052
They fed her bogus information.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.640
And she called us.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.297
She walked right into it.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.842
Mary Vu,
that's who they're gonna kill.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.513
(siren wailing)

28:57.819 --> 28:59.434
Mary Vu's not picking up her cell.

28:59.488 --> 29:00.728
All right, call Peckstein.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.817
Let's start with getting 'em
over to Mary Vu's place.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.982
We'll drop Tommy off
and meet 'em there.

29:05.035 --> 29:05.990
(cell phone ringing)

29:06.036 --> 29:07.367
Gimme that.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.948
The phone, Dov.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.039
Uh, Peck here.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.076
Where's Epstein?
Where are you guys?

29:15.128 --> 29:16.914
King and Spadina.
Uh, what's happening?

29:16.964 --> 29:19.296
All right, the hit's on Mary Vu.
1290 Carlaw.

29:19.341 --> 29:20.501
You gotta get there right now.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.632
1290 Carlaw.
We're on it. Okay.

29:22.719 --> 29:25.802
It's as bad as they say,
isn't it, labor pain?

29:25.847 --> 29:27.462
Worse.

29:27.516 --> 29:28.505
Great.

29:29.851 --> 29:32.058
But then it's crazy.

29:33.522 --> 29:34.887
'Cause, like, minutes later,

29:34.940 --> 29:39.149
then you have this child
lying on your chest,

29:39.194 --> 29:42.982
and it's like... amnesia.

29:43.991 --> 29:46.653
lt's blissful amnesia.

29:46.702 --> 29:47.908
— (siren wailing)
— Dov?

29:47.953 --> 29:48.942
— Dov!
— I'm okay.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.361
My God, I don't believe this.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.496
Dispatch, this is 1519.

29:52.541 --> 29:55.078
We're heading to 1290 Carlaw.
We need backup.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.459
(dispatcher on radio)
Copy. 1503 and 1522,

29:57.504 --> 29:59.495
— please proceed to 1290 Carlaw.
— Gail, I'm okay.

29:59.548 --> 30:01.129
— Shut up!
— ...requesting backup.

30:03.719 --> 30:06.461
I'm just gonna grab your tea.
I'll be right back.

30:11.685 --> 30:13.141
(gun cocks)

30:13.186 --> 30:14.312
What the hell are you doing here?

30:15.063 --> 30:16.018
Put the gun down.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.520
What are you doing here?

30:17.566 --> 30:18.897
— (cell phone rings)
— Turn it off.

30:18.942 --> 30:22.059
(Mary) Officer Nash?
You okay in there?

30:22.112 --> 30:23.602
— (ring)
— Yeah, I'm fine.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.270
I'm fine. Just relax.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.814
Get on your knees.

30:26.867 --> 30:28.607
— (ring)
— Please.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.651
— Just get on your knees.
— Okay. Okay.

30:30.704 --> 30:32.194
(Hng)

30:32.247 --> 30:33.532
Give me your gun.

30:33.582 --> 30:34.697
Take it easy.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.411
Come on.
Just give me your gun.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.496
No.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.081
— Kenny?
— Get back in the living room!

30:40.130 --> 30:41.210
What the hell are you doing?!

30:41.256 --> 30:42.416
You talked to the cops?

30:42.466 --> 30:45.378
I told you you couldn't tell
another living soul,

30:45.427 --> 30:47.418
and you talk to the cops?!
How could you?

30:47.471 --> 30:49.553
What the hell else
was I supposed to do?

30:49.598 --> 30:52.055
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot me?

30:53.143 --> 30:54.974
— Stay back!
— Okay, calm down.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.762
(siren wailing)
Everybody just calm down.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.557
(Gail) Well, somebody
obviously beat us here.

31:01.610 --> 31:06.024
Who's in car 1504?
Oh, look who I'm asking.

31:06.073 --> 31:09.782
Dispatch, this is 1519.
Who the hell is in car 1504?

31:09.826 --> 31:12.613
(dispatcher)
1504... is Nash's car.

31:12.662 --> 31:14.243
Okay, call her.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.162
You can still go back
on this, Kenny.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.823
No. It's over.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.242
No, it's not.
You can still walk.

31:20.337 --> 31:21.452
You haven't done anything yet,
not really.

31:21.505 --> 31:22.460
(cell phone ringing)

31:22.506 --> 31:25.088
You can still get out of this.

31:25.175 --> 31:28.542
She told us
because she loves you, Kenny.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.756
— (ringing)
— She wants to get out of here

31:30.847 --> 31:32.553
with you, somewhere safe,

31:32.599 --> 31:35.181
and you can do that right now.
You can still do it.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.683
You can still walk away.

31:38.772 --> 31:39.887
— No answer.
— Hey. Whoa.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.225
Get back in the car.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.980
— Gail, I'm fine.
— Get back in the car.

31:43.026 --> 31:45.233
What happens when backup gets here,
and I'm sitting in the squad car?

31:45.278 --> 31:46.358
We tell them the truth.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.396
You had a really bad reaction
to some medication that you're on,

31:48.448 --> 31:49.858
and that's it.
It wasn't safe for you to go in.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.569
Now get back in the——
Get back in the car.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.530
Sit tight.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.910
Just stay here.

31:55.956 --> 31:57.162
Watch the door.
I'm sure it's nothing.

31:57.207 --> 31:58.196
Give me your pills.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.546
How are we supposed to make it?

32:03.755 --> 32:06.212
— We will make it.
— We need money.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.623
So we do what we have to do.

32:07.676 --> 32:08.791
Listen to Mary, Kenny.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.967
If that means washing dishes,

32:11.012 --> 32:13.219
that's what we will do, for her.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.757
You will do it for her. Okay?

32:16.810 --> 32:18.471
You're gonna do it all for that tiny,
little person in there,

32:18.520 --> 32:21.478
the one that's making your girlfriend
so sick right now.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.309
Okay?

32:23.358 --> 32:25.189
You can do it.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.525
You will make it.

32:35.704 --> 32:36.693
(sets gun down)

32:39.374 --> 32:40.784
— (door opens)
— (Gail) Police!

32:42.043 --> 32:45.956
Officer Nash,
is everything okay in there?

32:46.006 --> 32:47.542
Yeah, come in. You can cuff him.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.505
Kenny Chan,

32:52.554 --> 32:55.011
you're under arrest
for assault with a weapon.

32:55.056 --> 32:57.308
I didn't want to do this.

32:57.350 --> 32:59.181
I never wanted to do any of this.

33:04.816 --> 33:08.308
Hey, it's okay.

33:08.361 --> 33:11.273
It's okay.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.029
— (crying)
— It's okay.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.529
Must've been nice
to hang out with Samuels.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.114
You guys are like old friends, huh?

33:18.163 --> 33:21.496
Yeah, we were.
Just haven't seen him in a while.

33:21.541 --> 33:22.530
Maybe that's why he signed up.

33:22.584 --> 33:23.915
You know, it wasn't until he heard
you were gonna be here

33:23.960 --> 33:25.791
that he showed any interest.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.293
— What?
— Will you excuse me a second?

33:28.381 --> 33:29.507
Wow. You clean up good.

33:29.549 --> 33:30.504
Oh, wow.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.547
| just sent my daily report off
to your staff sergeant.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.587
— Mm—hmm.
— You want to know what it says?

33:36.640 --> 33:38.050
No, I don't. I don't care.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.350
You know what?
I had a lot of fun today.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.223
| feel better than I have
in a longtime.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.806
— Go out with me.
— Pardon me?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.811
I'm a lot better with horses
than I am people,

33:45.857 --> 33:47.813
but I would really like
to take you out.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.067
Nope. No, no, no. I'm sorry.
I'm not ready for that.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.898
You just——You'd be a rebound,

33:52.948 --> 33:56.736
and, uh, I think you deserve
better than that, but thank you.

33:56.785 --> 33:57.900
For what?

33:59.204 --> 34:00.489
I really needed you...

34:00.539 --> 34:01.870
and this.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.123
Hold on a second.
Did you fudge my competition time

34:09.172 --> 34:10.582
'cause you wanted to ask me out?

34:10.632 --> 34:12.293
(scoffs) Absolutely.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.128
So you're gonna be harder
on me tomorrow?

34:14.177 --> 34:15.838
Absolutely.

34:15.929 --> 34:18.762
— Great.
— (horse nickers)

34:18.807 --> 34:20.638
(Man) Beers tonight, boys?

34:24.271 --> 34:25.852
You knew I was gonna be here,
didn't you?

34:25.939 --> 34:27.600
That's the only reason
you signed up for this training.

34:27.649 --> 34:28.764
— Whoa, bro——
— No, don't——don't——

34:28.817 --> 34:31.103
Don't "bro" me, okay?

34:31.152 --> 34:33.279
Look, I don't know
what happened this time.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.027
Okay, I wasn't there this time,

34:35.115 --> 34:37.447
but I do know what happened last time.
Here's what I know.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.234
Okay, we went out,
you got hammered,

34:40.287 --> 34:42.994
you wouldn't give me the keys,
you did 120 in a 60 zone,

34:43.039 --> 34:45.030
and you wrapped your car
around a tree.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.244
Okay, and then I lied about it.
That's what I know.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.666
Yeah, you know what?
And if you say that,

34:48.753 --> 34:51.620
they'll just know you covered for me.
You'll go down just as hard.

34:51.673 --> 34:52.708
I know.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.042
Chris,

34:54.092 --> 34:55.502
you've worked hard for this, man.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.213
You've worked way too hard for this.

34:57.262 --> 35:00.504
I know! Okay?

35:00.557 --> 35:02.673
Which is why I'm gonna do it again.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.593
Why is why I'm gonna |ie——for you——again.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.349
Cool.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.059
Hey, listen, some of the guys
are going out for——

35:10.108 --> 35:11.348
What, for drinks?

35:11.401 --> 35:12.561
Yeah, but——

35:12.611 --> 35:13.851
Nah, man, I'm out.

35:17.574 --> 35:19.530
(police radio chatter,
siren wails)

35:31.504 --> 35:33.881
(papers slam,
telephones ringing)

35:33.923 --> 35:35.914
(indistinct conversations)

35:50.940 --> 35:52.521
(Velcro rips)

35:56.821 --> 35:58.322
(keypad beeps)

35:59.949 --> 36:02.235
(cell phone rings)

36:02.285 --> 36:03.115
Hey.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.241
Hey.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.788
(Jerry) You still at that girl's place?

36:05.830 --> 36:09.163
Yeah. I don't want her
to wake up alone, so...

36:09.209 --> 36:12.121
You think that conspiracy charge
on Tommy Chan'll stick?

36:12.170 --> 36:14.035
I don't know.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.507
I mean, that lawyer's suit's
worth more than my car.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.507
— (chuckles) Long odds.
— Yeah.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.292
Jerry, we're good, right?

36:21.346 --> 36:23.678
What do you mean?

36:23.723 --> 36:26.635
We're gonna be good, right?

36:28.061 --> 36:29.221
I don't know.

36:30.397 --> 36:31.933
Well, you're a good cop,

36:31.981 --> 36:34.233
good instincts.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.727
What does your gut say?

36:37.362 --> 36:38.977
Yeah, we're gonna be good.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.234
Good answer.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.655
(laughs to himself)

36:46.037 --> 36:48.744
Ah, Sammy. Thank you so much.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.663
— Thank you so much, brother.
— What for, man?

36:50.709 --> 36:52.870
Well, ljust——| talked to Zoe
like you told me to,

36:52.919 --> 36:54.250
— told her about the strippers.
— And?

36:54.337 --> 36:56.202
Well, she told me
not to come home tonight!

36:56.256 --> 36:58.668
What the hell are you doing
asking me for relationship advice?

36:58.717 --> 37:00.924
Well, you got me, man.
I don't know.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.136
Just give her some time, brother.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.088
— She'll come around.
— Oh, yeah?

37:03.138 --> 37:04.093
She'll come around.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.345
— Yeah. Yeah.
— Yeah, yeah?

37:05.432 --> 37:07.297
Guess what.
Until then, you're buying.

37:07.350 --> 37:08.851
And guess what.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.641
I'm your new roommate.

37:12.522 --> 37:13.807
Uaughs)

37:29.873 --> 37:32.615
Okay. You want to talk, talk.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.658
The thing is I know what you're gonna say,

37:34.711 --> 37:38.295
and l——l get it. I agree 100%.
You can't do it. You can't.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.954
I mean, I wouldn't.

37:40.008 --> 37:41.418
— Can't what?
— (sighs)

37:41.468 --> 37:44.756
You can't start dating a 38—year—old woman
who wants a baby so badly

37:44.804 --> 37:46.920
she's working every overtime shift
she can get

37:46.973 --> 37:48.838
to pay for very expensive
fertility treatments.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.970
I mean, why the hell would you
jump onboard for that?

37:52.020 --> 37:53.851
I mean, we haven't even kissed yet.

37:57.192 --> 38:00.434
(man) J‘ Don't turn J‘

38:00.487 --> 38:02.773
J‘ Us around J‘

38:05.116 --> 38:08.574
J‘ Don't turn J‘

38:08.620 --> 38:10.986
J‘ Us around J‘

38:13.625 --> 38:16.458
J‘ Trees... J‘

38:16.503 --> 38:17.788
Thanks.

38:20.590 --> 38:21.545
Here you go.

38:21.591 --> 38:24.003
Oh, thanks.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.542
Hey. Where's, uh——
Where's Peckstein?

38:25.595 --> 38:26.755
I mean, they should be here by now.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.137
I know. I missed 'em today.

38:29.182 --> 38:30.297
Don't tell Gail | just said that.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.056
Uaughs)

38:32.101 --> 38:33.887
Oh, God.

38:33.937 --> 38:35.928
I make a terrible lone wolf.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.231
You do.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.099
Okay, if I tell you something,

38:41.152 --> 38:42.767
you promise just to keep it
between us?

38:42.821 --> 38:44.812
Sure.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.650
(sighs)

38:46.699 --> 38:48.690
I love being a cop.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.485
Andy, that's not a secret.

38:51.538 --> 38:52.573
(both chuckle)

38:52.622 --> 38:54.408
— All right? Cheers.
— All right.

38:54.457 --> 38:55.742
— (clink)
— (chuckles)

38:56.960 --> 38:59.451
(indistinct conversations)

38:59.504 --> 39:01.540
(Chris) All right. I'm gonna call Gail.

39:01.589 --> 39:02.840
— Be right back?
— Yep.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.418
All right.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.750
You know, I really don't mind
driving you home.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.676
— It's really not a big deal.
— No, it's okay.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.336
The nurse said I was fine,
you know?

39:10.390 --> 39:12.551
— I'll just stick to juice.
— Okay.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.683
I told Chris we'd meet him inside.

39:15.728 --> 39:16.717
Oh, okay.

39:19.232 --> 39:20.847
— Gail——
— Don't.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.856
— (cell phone rings)
— Okay.

39:22.902 --> 39:23.891
We should go in.

39:23.945 --> 39:25.606
— (ring)
— Yeah.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.901
(Hng)

39:30.702 --> 39:31.691
(Hng)

39:38.543 --> 39:41.410
(siren wailing in distance)
