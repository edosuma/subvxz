WEBVTT

00:02.753 --> 00:07.998
Every wormhole system has
millions of exits, each to a
distinct time and place.

00:08.092 --> 00:09.957
Einstein, what the hell
is going on here?

00:10.052 --> 00:11.633
Aeryn's out there under
a flag of truce.

00:11.721 --> 00:14.303
Katratzi.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.597
You will never get the
wormhole tech from me.

00:16.684 --> 00:21.553
Scorpius is here, looking
for the key to what is
inside my head.

00:21.647 --> 00:24.263
He will use you and the baby.

00:24.358 --> 00:29.102
We need a sensor distorter
for our ship, to fool
long-range scans.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.653
Gizahl

00:30.740 --> 00:32.105
A Scarran!

00:32.200 --> 00:34.407
If I'm not back at the Pod in
half an am, you go without me.

00:34.493 --> 00:35.824
What?
-Go.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.329
Pilot:
The Scarran warship is
still in pursuit.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.452
What about the...

00:43.586 --> 00:45.872
Baby? What about the baby?

00:46.839 --> 00:47.749
What?

00:47.840 --> 00:49.626
Where's Aeryn?

00:52.678 --> 00:54.714
A bioloid.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.057
Crichton:
I don't care about the
things you care about.

00:57.141 --> 01:00.884
Peacekeepers rule the Scarrans,
Scarrans rule the Peacekeepers.

01:00.978 --> 01:04.311
I care about one thing.

01:04.398 --> 01:09.267
Help me get her and I will
give you wormholes.

01:10.279 --> 01:13.692
And now, on Farscape.

01:13.783 --> 01:16.069
Aeryn:
There was one guard.
I don't remember her face.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.072
She never told me her name.

01:20.164 --> 01:23.031
She told me a legend about...

01:24.585 --> 01:28.874
how Sebaceans once had
a god called...

01:31.259 --> 01:33.090
Djancaz-Bru.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.845
Six worlds prayed to her.

01:37.932 --> 01:43.302
They... built her temples,
conquered planets.

01:43.396 --> 01:45.808
And yet, one day she still...

01:45.898 --> 01:49.061
rose up and destroyed
all six worlds.

01:49.151 --> 01:53.144
And when the last warrior
was dying, he...

01:53.239 --> 02:01.203
he said, "We gave you
everything. Why did you
destroy us?"

02:01.289 --> 02:05.202
And she looked down upon him,
and she whispered,

02:09.755 --> 02:11.620
"Because I can."

02:19.473 --> 02:22.010
Aeryn could be dead.
-The Scarrans will
not kill her.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.181
They wanna use her to find me.

02:23.269 --> 02:25.180
The Scarrans will
mind rape her until

02:25.271 --> 02:27.227
she has no allegiance to you.
-I will find her before then.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.306
She will not be able to resist
for long. I know...

02:29.400 --> 02:30.936
Stop. I'll find her.

02:31.027 --> 02:33.188
| just want to make you aware
of the improbability...

02:33.279 --> 02:35.895
-I am aware. Shut up.
...of what you propose.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.196
You have a plan?

02:38.284 --> 02:41.776
Yes, and don't interrupt
before I finish, no matter
how stupid it sounds.

02:41.871 --> 02:42.781
John...

02:42.872 --> 02:45.329
I said do not interrupt.

02:45.416 --> 02:49.204
When I met Einstein,
l blipped to bizarro Moya.

02:49.295 --> 02:51.160
Same Leviathan, but different.

02:51.255 --> 02:54.042
The Stark there uttered
"Katratzi."

02:54.133 --> 02:56.374
I know that.

02:59.472 --> 03:01.258
I thought it was gobbledy-gook.

03:01.349 --> 03:04.591
But then Sikozu heard the
same word when Aeryn
was being kidnapped.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.186
I know that, too.

03:06.270 --> 03:10.183
You think this Katratzi
is the Scarran base
they'll be taking her?

03:10.274 --> 03:12.435
Right. But you do not know
where it is, do you?

03:12.526 --> 03:15.643
No, you know that.
-Right again.

03:15.738 --> 03:21.449
So, I figure if bizarro Stark
knows the name of the base he
might know its location.

03:21.535 --> 03:25.198
That's it. Best I got. You got
any better ideas, | listen.

03:25.289 --> 03:30.875
lfl help with this insanity,
and we do get Aeryn back,

03:34.965 --> 03:38.332
you will tell me all you know
about wormholes?

03:39.261 --> 03:43.300
Every equation, every formula?

03:47.186 --> 03:48.392
Everything.

04:17.258 --> 04:19.419
What are we in, the Mob?

04:27.560 --> 04:29.266
Your turn.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.060
Nosferatu.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.527
First instinct is always right.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.821
Scarran Blood Vow.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.572
You hate everything Scarran.

04:48.914 --> 04:53.123
I will help, if you taste.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.893
Look, Djancaz-Bru,

05:16.984 --> 05:19.441
I know I'm not the sort
of person who usually does
this sort of thing,

05:19.528 --> 05:23.316
so I'm not quite sure what I'm
supposed to be saying,

05:23.407 --> 05:27.195
except that I really
need your help.

05:27.286 --> 05:30.449
I need you to send me some
sort of sign that he's
coming for me.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.825
Can you do that?
(door opening)

05:32.917 --> 05:35.158
I've given you time
to consider.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.413
Are you ready to answer?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.332
Yes.

05:42.051 --> 05:43.757
(grunting)

05:46.931 --> 05:48.262
Stiinga-tuk.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.761
Wait, did I pronounce
that correctly?
Let me try that again.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.228
Stiinga-tuk. That's better.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.803
I gave you a chance.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.105
Where is Crichton?

05:58.192 --> 05:59.398
ldon't know! I...

05:59.485 --> 06:02.192
Stop resisting. Where is he?

06:11.247 --> 06:15.160
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

06:15.251 --> 06:18.994
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

06:19.088 --> 06:20.874
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

06:20.965 --> 06:24.173
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

06:24.260 --> 06:26.000
my friends.

06:27.096 --> 06:28.927
I've made enemies.

06:29.014 --> 06:32.256
Powerful, dangerous.

06:32.351 --> 06:35.843
Now all I want is to
find a way home

06:35.938 --> 06:38.680
to warn Earth.

06:38.774 --> 06:43.859
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.508
Aeryn:
He's...

07:16.604 --> 07:18.344
he's on Moya.

07:18.439 --> 07:19.849
600 telliks and rising.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.441
If you don't stop,
you'll kill her.

07:21.525 --> 07:26.064
I'm using no more force than
usual. This won't harm her.

07:26.155 --> 07:29.147
What do you know abut
Crichton's wormhole research?

07:29.241 --> 07:30.742
620.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.817
I don't know anything.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.742
He didn't tell me anything.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.070
Stop.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.661
(agonized grunt)

07:39.752 --> 07:42.619
What's the matter with this one?
Is she weak, or is she faking?

07:42.713 --> 07:44.749
She's not faking.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.798
Well when she wakes, convince
her to tell me all that she
knows if she wants to live.

07:47.885 --> 07:51.002
Or I will start again.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.348
D'Argo:
You're going to go to
the variant Moya?

07:53.432 --> 07:56.014
Yeah.
-But you could end up on Earth
again. Mess up everything.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.513
No, I got this hum in my head,
like a whale.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.344
A whale? What's a whale?

08:00.439 --> 08:01.849
You know what a fish is?
-Fish.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.225
Think big fish with sonar.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.898
John, I think you should
have a rest before...

08:04.985 --> 08:06.896
D, I got a hum in my head.
I'm gonna follow it.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.603
Well, you got something in
there, but it's not a brain.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.906
Einstein said I can get back to
the places I've been to before.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.700
It's like a homing beacon.
I can make it.

08:15.788 --> 08:17.278
You can't go with fek-face.

08:17.373 --> 08:19.238
He'll screw you and then
he'll betray you.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.166
So little trust, Nebari.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.868
What's going on?
Why are you going with him?

08:24.963 --> 08:26.373
John and l have an agreement.

08:26.465 --> 08:29.332
D'Argo:
What agreement?
-The details are confidential.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.041
John, don't.

08:31.136 --> 08:35.300
Guys, I know what I'm doing
is stupid, but it's
out of my hands.

08:35.391 --> 08:37.131
I gotta save Aeryn.
You know that.

08:37.226 --> 08:40.343
Just get us close to
the wormhole.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.849
If we don't come back...

08:46.235 --> 08:47.941
Right.

08:55.411 --> 08:57.367
Feeling better?

08:58.622 --> 09:00.158
Critical heat delirium.

09:00.249 --> 09:03.992
Mmm, I almost couldn't get your
temperature down in time.

09:04.086 --> 09:07.704
I thought Peacekeepers
were supposed to be
battle strengthened.

09:08.966 --> 09:11.457
Why did his heat probe
almost kill you?

09:11.552 --> 09:14.589
I... I'm tired.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.217
Just go away.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.719
Wish I could.

09:19.810 --> 09:25.476
Listen, that fenik will kill
you unless you give him a
reason not to.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.727
I've seen it happen.

09:27.818 --> 09:30.150
You'll be just another D.I.T.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.944
"Died in Transit."

09:33.866 --> 09:36.198
All right. Don't listen.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.402
I'm just trying to
save your life.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.913
Are you really Sebacean?

09:44.209 --> 09:45.665
Yes.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.243
Does it make it easier?

09:48.338 --> 09:52.206
To make the others do your
dirty work and you take
the coward's choice?

09:52.301 --> 09:57.341
Listen, I've heard all
that dren before.

09:57.431 --> 10:01.015
Usually from people like you,
chained to a cell.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.218
Look at me. I'm not.
You know why?

10:04.313 --> 10:09.899
Because I figured out a long
time ago, Peacekeepers,
Scarrans,

10:09.985 --> 10:12.226
what difference does it
matter who rules?

10:12.321 --> 10:14.437
It won't be me.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.193
All I'm going to do is survive.

10:17.284 --> 10:21.402
I suggest you should
do the same.

10:23.415 --> 10:27.249
I'll tell Captain Jenek you're
ready for another interrogation.

10:38.305 --> 10:42.639
Pilot, thank Moya for us
and stay well clear.
You guys have come far enough.

10:42.726 --> 10:46.765
Crichton, Moya's senses
indicate the wormhole
is destabilizing.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.392
Yeah, it's not too good.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.520
Grasshopper, you still
up for this?

10:52.611 --> 10:55.944
I wasjust musing. If you miss
your intended target,

10:56.031 --> 11:00.866
we could change the future,
or the past.

11:00.953 --> 11:04.946
Create a world devoid of
Peacekeepers and Scarrans.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.031
Would you like that, John?

11:07.751 --> 11:09.992
Clear the mechanism.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.211
Focus.

11:14.383 --> 11:15.998
Guys.

11:16.093 --> 11:19.130
We'll see you around.
-Good luck, Crichton.

11:20.806 --> 11:22.592
And come back.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.572
Left.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.321
And left again.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.777
Thought you knew where
you were going.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.828
Shut up, Grasshopper,
I'm trying to concentrate.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.201
Left.

11:51.461 --> 11:52.587
Up there.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.332
That should be it.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.549
And we are.... here.

12:11.106 --> 12:14.018
And where exactly is "here"?

12:14.109 --> 12:19.320
The signal from her bioloid
stopped before our dreadnaught
could locate their Leviathan.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.146
How did they detect
it so quickly?

12:21.241 --> 12:24.153
That is the first question
I will ask the Sebacean.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.782
Captain, there's something
about her.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.080
Her reaction to your heat probe
was so severe, I was...

12:30.167 --> 12:32.249
Nurse, you seem confused.

12:32.336 --> 12:36.295
ldon't care if she dies. Her
usefulness is most likely
already completed.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.497
I know, but give me an arn.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.299
I have an idea how she still
might be useful to us.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.546
One arn.

12:42.638 --> 12:45.129
Then she answers or dies.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.806
Something to make you sleep.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.228
I don't need any help.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.646
Orders.
-No, I don't want it.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.065
Stay away from me.
Get away from me and
don't touch...

12:57.152 --> 12:58.892
(gasps )

12:58.987 --> 13:02.195
It'll only be more painful
if you fight.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.738
(grunts)

13:03.825 --> 13:05.281
Get it out of me!

13:05.369 --> 13:06.779
(grunts)

13:06.870 --> 13:09.111
Wait a minute. You're not giving
me something. You're taking.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.197
What are you doing?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.532
(grunts)

13:13.627 --> 13:15.959
( gasps ):
What have you done?

13:16.046 --> 13:19.664
Crichton:
Some kind of crap has frozen up
in the fluid drives.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.544
We're not going anywhere
unless I can...

13:21.635 --> 13:24.342
Hey, flip that switch again.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.339
(machinery whines)

13:25.430 --> 13:28.137
Ironic, wouldn't it be,

13:28.225 --> 13:30.762
if we were to die here together.

13:30.852 --> 13:34.219
Yeah, we're a regular
Romeo and Juliet.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.645
Damn this.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.940
This spinning makes me feel
like I'm drinking Mezcal.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.642
You got something like Mezcal?

13:40.737 --> 13:43.023
Drink the drink, eat the worm.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.697
I could see you eating a whole
plateful of worms.

13:46.201 --> 13:49.284
Maybe not.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.362
Just for the record, if you'd
have gotten the information

13:51.456 --> 13:54.163
and were able to control
wormholes, what would you
have done with it?

13:54.251 --> 13:57.163
Taken over as much of the
universe as possible,

13:59.923 --> 14:01.254
That's not funny.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.504
No.

14:04.594 --> 14:10.510
No, I would use the wormholes
as a deterrent against any
future Scarran attack.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.306
All right, strap yourself in.

14:12.394 --> 14:15.431
We could be in for
a little jolt.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.186
That stuff should be
melted by now.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.768
(machinery whirs)
Oh, come on baby.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.448
This should work.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.194
(engine racing)

14:35.292 --> 14:36.702
Left.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.158
Again.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.959
Gotta go.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.422
Is that the Moya we're
looking for?

14:52.517 --> 14:54.769
Crichton:
Better be.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.185
My head's ringing like
a fire bell.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.638
How did you know we planned
to kidnap Grayza?

14:59.733 --> 15:01.849
(gasping):
I... ljust...

15:01.943 --> 15:03.228
Again!

15:03.320 --> 15:05.151
How did you know?

15:05.238 --> 15:07.900
( gasps ):
Accident.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.527
Captain Jenek, stop.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.325
The Sebacean is dissembling,
she will...

15:12.412 --> 15:14.494
No! I know why she's
reacting like this.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.162
Stop!
-Do not interfere.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.114
She's with child.

15:18.210 --> 15:22.123
Scarran heat probe will kill
a pregnant Sebacean.

15:22.214 --> 15:24.125
With child?

15:24.216 --> 15:28.175
Well she was close to Crichton,
was she not?

15:28.261 --> 15:31.298
Yes.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.517
I couldn't have stopped him.
-You should have. Aeryn is dead.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.092
I know Scarrans.
She is dead by now.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.677
We are not leaving.

15:38.772 --> 15:42.230
Grayza knows the location of
this wormhole. D'Argo!

15:42.317 --> 15:45.229
She put the Skreeth on Moya
when we were last here...

15:45.320 --> 15:48.232
Listen to her, Captain.
She's right.

15:48.323 --> 15:52.236
Grayza knows Crichton used
this wormhole as a path
to get back to Earth.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.909
She knows he'll come back here.

15:54.996 --> 15:58.488
And I thought you were finally
convinced Crichton's wormholes
would get you home.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.835
(sighs)

16:00.919 --> 16:02.875
We're staying another arn.

16:02.963 --> 16:06.126
Pilot, get Moya to do a long
point, all range scan.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.423
I don't care if it's a gas
cloud or an asteroid field.

16:37.414 --> 16:40.702
Can you retrieve incumbent
knowledge from fetal DNA?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.202
Not here.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.626
But the med labs on Katratzi
might be able to.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.249
What have you done?

16:46.339 --> 16:47.419
What did you say to him?

16:47.507 --> 16:48.713
(whispers ):
I've saved your life.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.176
You realize what this
could mean?

16:50.260 --> 16:53.297
If this is Crichton's child,
we could learn all he knows

16:53.388 --> 16:55.925
about the wormholes from
this fetal DNA.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.007
Yes.
-Get me out of here.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.932
Get me the frell out!

17:00.020 --> 17:01.931
Get me out!

17:10.447 --> 17:13.314
Aeryn:
Djancaz-Bru,

17:13.408 --> 17:18.744
I'm going to say this again
because I don't think you
heard me last time.

17:20.248 --> 17:24.287
Just get a message to him.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.961
Let him know where I am
so that he can find me.

17:29.758 --> 17:33.250
I didn't think Peacekeepers
had gods.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.670
I thought they believed
in the Warrior Code.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.972
"Battle and die" and
all that dren.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.095
Is there a Peacekeeper here?

17:41.186 --> 17:42.175
Can she help us?

17:42.270 --> 17:44.647
She can't even help herself.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.346
She's praying.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.069
Whose child is it?

17:55.033 --> 17:58.150
Captain Jenek will
force it from you.

17:58.245 --> 18:02.705
He believes that if he can
find the human's child,
the Scarrans will reward him.

18:02.791 --> 18:06.158
Right now, he's dreaming of
palaces and virgins.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.790
I'm very happy for him.
-I warn you.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.711
He won't kill you.

18:10.799 --> 18:15.759
But unless you tell him what
he wants, he'll make you
wish you were dead.

18:15.845 --> 18:19.804
I have a dozens of embryos
inside me. I recreated
with so many people.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.097
Mmm.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.846
Just one. Whose is it?

18:23.937 --> 18:25.768
No, really.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.983
P.K. Tralka, that's what
they used to call me.

18:29.067 --> 18:32.275
Talk to the other women here.
They'll tell you.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.069
We can keep you drugged, asleep.

18:35.156 --> 18:39.195
Or we can make things
hard and ugly.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.902
Worse than you can imagine.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.673
(shuddenng)

18:59.264 --> 19:01.550
Crichton:
Every wormhole has
millions of exits

19:01.641 --> 19:04.348
to different times and places
which are complete and unending.

19:04.436 --> 19:08.520
So in this reality everyone on
Moya has became someone they
weren't before?

19:08.606 --> 19:12.190
Like they went into a blender.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.895
Why?

19:16.990 --> 19:19.231
With these wormholes,
anything is possible.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.238
Somewhere the Cubs are
winning the World Series.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.323
Don't ask.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.951
Did you feel that?

19:27.042 --> 19:28.782
Better hurry.

19:28.877 --> 19:32.790
We got an arn before Crais
overruns this place and
slaughters everybody.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.542
Stark?

19:39.387 --> 19:40.376
Rygel?

19:40.472 --> 19:42.212
Crichton:
Mm-hmm.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.760
It's a weird universe.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.551
I didn't invent it.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.603
Morrock:
Genetic incubation.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.772
They find something
interesting about us.

19:52.859 --> 19:57.273
See if they can produce an
offspring that they can use.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.150
They've bred me six times.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.528
Three of them died before term.

20:02.619 --> 20:05.156
Three of them, I don't know
where they are.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.579
So what's interesting
aboutyou?

20:08.666 --> 20:11.328
The organic food on my planet
grows a metal skin.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.284
I can dissolve it with saliva.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.372
Why don't you spit on these
and get us out of here?

20:17.384 --> 20:20.421
Can't do that. Only thin metal.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.257
Right.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.510
Well, that's why they're
breeding me.

20:26.601 --> 20:31.686
See if this little gnik in here
can destroy weapons grade metal.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.685
And you just happen to be awake
right now to talk to me?

20:34.776 --> 20:39.395
No. I palm the dren they
give me to sleep.

20:39.489 --> 20:44.108
(whispers ):
I've saved up enough so I can
kill myself whenever I want.

20:45.453 --> 20:48.115
You don't believe a
word I'm saying.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.868
You think I'm working for
that bitch nurse?

20:52.252 --> 20:54.584
Well?
-They don't need me
to control you.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.787
You can't beat them.

20:56.881 --> 21:00.465
They travel us around
on frelled-up freighters
like this,

21:00.552 --> 21:03.214
and no one ever knows
exactly where we are.

21:03.304 --> 21:07.047
No one can save us.
And we can't escape.

21:07.142 --> 21:09.554
I know. I've tried for cycles.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.430
Then I gave up.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.313
Butlsee.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.767
You still think
someone's coming.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.320
You should talk to me.

21:22.407 --> 21:25.319
In here, talk's all you've got.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.949
I heard you say it. "Katratzi."

21:34.043 --> 21:35.328
I don't know, Crichton!

21:35.420 --> 21:37.001
She did. She said it.

21:37.088 --> 21:39.625
She said it when Chiana was
killed! -Chiana's dead?

21:39.716 --> 21:41.547
No, no, no. Chiana's not dead.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.795
Would you like me to take over
the interrogation?

21:43.887 --> 21:44.922
Both:
Go away!

21:45.013 --> 21:46.719
Stark, shut up!
-Does Zhaan know...

21:46.806 --> 21:50.640
I heard you say a
Scarran word. Katra...
-Katratzi.

21:50.727 --> 21:53.139
Katratzi. I think it's a
military base.
-Katratzi.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.730
Do you know the location?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.315
Military base? No.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.264
You said it when you were
crossing someone over.

21:58.359 --> 21:59.940
When you were in that
trance state.

22:00.028 --> 22:02.394
No, I never have any
recollections when I'm
in the stykera state.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.400
But how could you speak in
the Scarran tongue?

22:04.491 --> 22:06.402
(grunts)

22:06.493 --> 22:09.405
Once I... I must have
crossed over a Scarran.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.737
They tell me things.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.413
And now you have
no memory of it?

22:14.501 --> 22:18.961
No. Only when I'm in the trance
does the knowledge come
flooding back to me.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.379
Where are you going?

22:23.468 --> 22:24.958
Keep him here.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.214
I'll be right back.

22:34.896 --> 22:37.638
It is a remarkable
reproductive structure.

22:37.732 --> 22:39.097
Watch.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.649
The Sebacean egg is fertilized.

22:41.736 --> 22:45.194
It splits with life,
it splits again,

22:45.281 --> 22:47.272
then stops.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.698
How does that happen?

22:48.785 --> 22:53.279
The ovum secretes a fluid that
keeps the pregnancy in stasis.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.830
Literally, freezes the
explosion of life.

22:55.917 --> 23:00.786
She can store this proto-fetus
for up to seven cycles before
triggering gestation.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.048
And that won't hurt the embryo?

23:06.135 --> 23:08.922
No. This will just pry the
truth out of her.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.130
No, don't use that. I won't lie
to you. I'll just tell you
what you want to know.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.307
You wouldn't lie to me?

23:19.607 --> 23:21.188
(grunts)

23:22.402 --> 23:25.235
(gasping)

23:25.321 --> 23:27.573
Yes, of course I'd lie to
you, you stupid bitch.

23:27.657 --> 23:28.737
( low growl )

23:28.825 --> 23:33.364
Aeryn. Whose child is
inside you?

23:33.788 --> 23:34.652
Yours.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.329
Whose child?

23:37.417 --> 23:38.748
I don't know.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.621
Is it John Crichton's?

23:40.712 --> 23:42.327
If... it were...

23:42.422 --> 23:43.252
Is it his?

23:43.339 --> 23:45.295
I don't kn-know.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.673
( growls )

23:47.760 --> 23:49.796
(gasps )

23:49.887 --> 23:51.423
There was another man.

23:51.514 --> 23:52.378
Another?

23:52.473 --> 23:53.508
Mmm.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.095
Aeryn:
Velorek.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.313
This Velorek, where is he now?

23:59.397 --> 24:01.353
He... he's dead.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.147
How did he die?

24:04.736 --> 24:06.442
What charge?!

24:06.529 --> 24:10.317
High Command executed him for
treason because I betrayed him.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.490
The man who conceived
your child?

24:13.161 --> 24:14.196
I reported him.

24:14.287 --> 24:17.245
She's lying! The serum isn't
working, give her more!

24:17.332 --> 24:20.199
Mmm, I'm not lying.
I'm just not a very nice...

24:20.293 --> 24:21.408
( groans )

24:25.256 --> 24:27.668
|, uh.... I...

24:27.759 --> 24:31.126
This Velorek. Is he the
father of your child?

24:31.220 --> 24:33.211
No.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.171
Wake up.

24:35.266 --> 24:37.177
Wake... up!

24:37.268 --> 24:38.644
Wake her up.

24:38.728 --> 24:41.720
I can't. Not until some of
the serum wears off.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.391
Are you working for her?

24:46.486 --> 24:48.442
No! Of course not!

24:48.529 --> 24:51.271
Your mind seems uncompromised.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.483
What about hers?

24:54.577 --> 24:59.116
How is her embryo coming along?

24:59.207 --> 25:05.703
I'm afraid her initial DNA scan
shows no enhanced ability
to the embryo.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.128
Then I will kill it.

25:07.215 --> 25:09.046
No, it's too early.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.340
No!

25:11.427 --> 25:14.294
It's too early!
Your tests can't be accurate!

25:14.389 --> 25:15.504
They're accurate.

25:15.598 --> 25:17.589
And I will to watch it die.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.640
No! No!

25:20.353 --> 25:22.218
It's too early!

25:22.313 --> 25:23.348
No!

25:25.024 --> 25:26.525
No!

25:26.609 --> 25:30.477
(screaming hysterically):
No, no, no!

25:31.656 --> 25:33.146
( screaming )

25:35.159 --> 25:39.778
Unless I get answers that
please me, you will be next.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.750
Rygel [Noranti]:
Let go of me!

25:46.838 --> 25:49.045
Who are you?!

25:49.132 --> 25:51.168
Crichton! What is happening?

25:51.259 --> 25:52.715
Dominar.

25:52.802 --> 25:54.042
Quiet.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.297
(grunts)

25:55.388 --> 25:57.595
Crichton, who is this tralk?!

25:58.975 --> 26:01.136
Now.

26:01.227 --> 26:05.436
You can channel past journeys
when you cross a soul over?

26:06.399 --> 26:07.605
Yes.

26:16.284 --> 26:17.239
( screaming )

26:17.326 --> 26:18.452
What are you doing?!

26:18.536 --> 26:20.572
Now cross her over!
-You cannot just shoot people!

26:20.663 --> 26:22.619
They'll be dead in an am.
You said so yourself.

26:22.707 --> 26:25.790
We don't have time to negotiate.
Now cross her over!

26:25.877 --> 26:28.118
No, I can't! I can't! I can't!

26:28.212 --> 26:29.327
And why not?

26:31.257 --> 26:34.215
l have to care about where it
goes to cross it over!

26:34.302 --> 26:36.338
What do you mean,
"love the soul"?

26:36.429 --> 26:38.169
You never had to love
the soul before.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.801
I've always had to
love the soul.

26:43.102 --> 26:46.185
Different Stark,
different rules.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.230
So, what happens if you
don't love the soul?
You won't cross it over?

26:49.317 --> 26:52.809
No, it's not a question of
"won't". I can't.

26:52.904 --> 26:54.940
When they die they...
they just go.

26:55.031 --> 26:56.612
Nothing happens.

27:02.038 --> 27:03.903
Whoops.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.380
( crying )

27:16.260 --> 27:18.171
Are you in pain?

27:18.262 --> 27:20.469
What do you care?

27:20.556 --> 27:24.595
I'm just a Scarran spy and
you're a Peacekeeper.

27:24.685 --> 27:27.222
No, I'm not a Peacekeeper.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.474
(sighs)

27:29.565 --> 27:32.728
That's the third one
they've terminated.

27:34.237 --> 27:37.229
I saw it on the scan.

27:37.323 --> 27:41.032
It must've been malformed, or...

27:41.118 --> 27:46.033
The three that survived,
they were beautiful.

27:47.124 --> 27:49.376
Healthy.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.202
And you've had six pregnancies?

27:53.381 --> 27:56.293
They'll wait a while,

27:56.384 --> 27:59.000
then they'll fertilize me again.

27:59.804 --> 28:02.090
Unless I've got the guts to...

28:08.688 --> 28:10.974
Have you ever had a child?

28:11.065 --> 28:13.226
No.
-Never?

28:13.317 --> 28:16.150
Well, soldiers seldom do,
unless they're placed
on a breeding roster.

28:16.237 --> 28:19.195
In any case, it's not the same
as being a mother, is it?

28:19.282 --> 28:22.365
That's why I vowed I'd never
have one that way.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.029
And now?

28:25.121 --> 28:29.364
And now protecting this child
will probably end my life.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.323
(whispering ):
There is another way.

28:31.419 --> 28:34.001
To make sure that they
never get it.

28:34.088 --> 28:37.251
I've hoarded enough sleep pills
for the both of us.

28:37.341 --> 28:41.380
But I've never been brave
enough to end it myself.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.587
Coward.

28:48.436 --> 28:50.392
What's your name?

28:50.479 --> 28:52.265
Morrock.

28:52.356 --> 28:56.975
Well, Morrock, when someone
comes to get me, they
can save you, too.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.821
Who does Stark love?
-You cannot just shoot people!

29:05.912 --> 29:07.527
I find your priorities odd.

29:07.622 --> 29:10.455
We are in a hurry and these
deformities are preordained
to die soon.

29:10.541 --> 29:12.202
Who does Stark love?!

29:12.293 --> 29:14.454
Just because you do not have
the resolution to...

29:14.545 --> 29:17.457
I got more than enough
resolution the last time
I was here

29:17.548 --> 29:21.917
and sometimes, Scorpy, I do not
like the way you do things!

29:22.011 --> 29:23.501
( growls )

29:23.596 --> 29:27.259
Pilot:
I've been comming them every
30 microts. Nothing.

29:27.350 --> 29:31.013
Rygel:
Will his module even be able to
make a reentry through that?

29:31.103 --> 29:32.764
I don't know.

29:32.855 --> 29:36.723
Moya's scans indicate the
wormhole's stability has
decreased another 12%.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.773
D'Argo, you know what
we should to do.
-Stop hammering me.

29:38.861 --> 29:41.944
Grayza is no fool. We will die
if we stay here much longer.

29:42.031 --> 29:44.317
I'm not leaving Crichton! We're
giving him another chance.

29:44.408 --> 29:46.114
How much longer?
-Look, I don't know!

29:46.202 --> 29:49.239
Back off, psycho.

29:49.330 --> 29:50.661
No, we should vote.

29:50.748 --> 29:53.239
We wake up Noranti and
the six of us vote.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.245
Because Crichton is safe!

29:55.336 --> 29:58.169
But we will die if
Grayza finds us here!

29:58.589 --> 30:00.375
Majority rules.

30:01.342 --> 30:02.548
Not yet, it doesn't.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.091
(inhales sharply)

30:04.178 --> 30:06.760
I'm the Captain. I'm not
willing to make that decision.

30:06.847 --> 30:10.055
Pilot:
I'm afraid you might have to.
-What's the matter, Pilot?

30:10.142 --> 30:14.135
Moya's long range scan has
just picked up another
vessel heading this way.

30:14.230 --> 30:15.720
D'Argo:
Is it military?

30:15.815 --> 30:17.897
I can't tell yet.

30:21.404 --> 30:24.020
Jenek:
Any match on the embryo DNA?

30:24.115 --> 30:27.152
Vreena:
Nothing. It's a pattern
the memory banks have never catalogued,

30:27.243 --> 30:29.199
so it could be half human.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.823
We have no sample of
Crichton's DNA.

30:31.914 --> 30:33.279
If I tell you?

30:33.374 --> 30:35.831
Your pain will end.

30:37.253 --> 30:40.370
When I was off Moya,
I had anotherjob.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.876
Assassinations. Subversions.

30:42.967 --> 30:45.174
Whatever I was ordered to do.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.306
There was a man named Lechna.

30:54.729 --> 30:57.766
He was my contact.
Found me all my assignments.

30:57.857 --> 31:02.977
But he was also my lover and I
have tried to suppress it
until now to protect him.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.777
But I don't want the
drugs anymore.

31:05.865 --> 31:09.107
It is most likely his
concepﬂon.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.987
This man.

31:11.078 --> 31:14.036
What world is he from?

31:14.123 --> 31:16.284
He's from a place
called Vendrall.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.366
It's a small planet
off most charts.

31:18.461 --> 31:19.621
Have you heard of it?

31:19.712 --> 31:21.543
Yes. It's in the Callus Nebula.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.246
That's a long way from here.

31:24.341 --> 31:27.708
Perhaps that's why the DNA
isn't in our database.

31:27.803 --> 31:31.967
I might cross-check the
genetic similarities
from the same nebula.

31:34.643 --> 31:37.100
We're gonna do this my way
with Stark, not yours.

31:37.188 --> 31:40.726
You haven't got the resolution
to do what's necessary.
-You can stop already with the resolution!

31:41.901 --> 31:43.357
Crichton!

31:43.444 --> 31:44.900
What are you doing with Chiana?

31:44.987 --> 31:47.319
That is Jool.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.239
Jool, just let us pass.

31:50.326 --> 31:53.910
What are you doing with Pip?

31:53.996 --> 31:55.657
(whispers):
Shoot him.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.409
Technically, it's a she.

31:57.500 --> 31:58.660
Shoot it!

31:58.751 --> 32:00.207
Let me handle this.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.535
Where are you taking Chiana?
-Jool, let us pass.

32:02.630 --> 32:03.665
Stay back!

32:03.756 --> 32:04.836
Shoot it!

32:04.924 --> 32:05.913
Damn it, Jool!

32:06.008 --> 32:06.872
Shoot it!

32:06.967 --> 32:08.218
(yells)

32:08.302 --> 32:09.337
( snarls )

32:09.428 --> 32:11.293
Are you satisfied?

32:11.388 --> 32:14.471
No. I don't like the way
you do things either.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.674
Very messy.

32:30.241 --> 32:32.402
No, don't!
-You lied!

32:33.285 --> 32:35.947
We found record of
Vendrall DNA.

32:36.038 --> 32:39.781
Your embryo is not the product
of one of Vendrall's sons.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.251
Aeryn:
Well Lechna lied to me.

32:41.335 --> 32:43.371
There is no Lechna!

32:43.462 --> 32:44.963
There is Lechna.

32:45.047 --> 32:46.207
Leave her alone!
-Give her more!

32:46.298 --> 32:48.038
I've doubled the strength.
-No, please!

32:48.134 --> 32:49.169
Again!

32:49.260 --> 32:50.625
Stop it! She's telling
the truth!

32:50.719 --> 32:51.708
Again!

32:51.804 --> 32:53.214
No, please, don't. No!

32:53.305 --> 32:54.385
You'll kill the child!

32:54.473 --> 32:57.135
Is John Crichton the
father of your child?

32:57.226 --> 33:00.593
I've already told you,
it's Lechna's, not Crichton's.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.599
How many times do l
have to tell you?

33:02.690 --> 33:05.227
I knew Lechna before
I went onto Moya.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.693
l was on Moya to watch Crichton.

33:06.777 --> 33:10.190
And as soon as I left, I went
straight back to Lechna.

33:12.449 --> 33:17.409
( crying ):
I have never... ever
loved John Crichton.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.704
I've never loved him.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.242
You lie.

33:26.046 --> 33:27.456
Tell the truth.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.789
(crying quietly)

33:29.884 --> 33:31.624
When I...

33:31.719 --> 33:33.334
Yes?

33:34.430 --> 33:36.341
When I left Moya...

33:37.600 --> 33:40.216
(men laughing)

33:48.360 --> 33:51.648
Ter... terminal soldier...
Lechna, he-he...

33:53.073 --> 33:55.655
I forgot all about Crichton.
It was...

33:58.037 --> 34:01.120
I completely forgot
about Crichton.

34:05.336 --> 34:07.793
I forgot all about him.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.181
D'Argo, it's a long way off,

34:21.268 --> 34:23.975
but the vessel approaching
seems to be a Command Carrier.

34:24.063 --> 34:26.224
We've done all Crichton
could ask of us.

34:26.315 --> 34:29.352
We've stayed here too long.
We must Starburst now.

34:29.443 --> 34:32.310
No. No, what if...

34:32.404 --> 34:35.316
what if we initiate the
engine signature change that
I bought off Rekka?

34:35.407 --> 34:36.863
Like we did before.

34:36.951 --> 34:38.111
Rygel:
Are you fahrbot?

34:38.202 --> 34:40.818
Turn Moya into a
Scarran freighter?

34:40.913 --> 34:43.370
Peacekeepers are approaching.
They'll attack anything Scarran.

34:43.457 --> 34:45.493
Chiana:
We won't let them
get that close.

34:45.584 --> 34:50.044
If they long-range scan us,
they'll move off because
we're not Moya.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.119
It's worth a shot.

34:51.215 --> 34:53.331
I need a decision, Captain.

34:53.425 --> 34:57.293
In thirty microts we'll be
in scanning range of
the Command Carrier.

34:57.388 --> 34:58.468
Come on.

34:58.555 --> 35:01.843
Okay. You wanted a vote?

35:01.934 --> 35:04.971
Do we Starburst or do
we initiate engine
signature change?

35:05.062 --> 35:06.222
Starburst.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.302
Starburst.

35:07.398 --> 35:08.683
Stay.

35:09.608 --> 35:10.472
Pilot?

35:10.567 --> 35:13.354
Moya and I say... stay.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.276
Okay, we're staying.

35:15.364 --> 35:17.355
Initiate the signature change.

35:18.951 --> 35:22.535
Scorpius:
Given these differences,
are you sure this will work?

35:23.372 --> 35:25.408
It's what happened before.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.369
Pip got killed.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.918
Stark channeled the Scarran
while he was crossing her over.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.164
You or me?

35:37.052 --> 35:38.883
I'll do it.

35:41.348 --> 35:44.181
Chiana [Aeryn]:
Hey, Crichton. Untie me.

35:44.268 --> 35:47.510
You know, I know I always
tie up people I like.

35:47.604 --> 35:50.892
Stark [Sikozu]:
If you kill her,
I won't help you.

35:50.983 --> 35:53.224
I won't cross her over.
-Yes, you will.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.480
What is he talking about?

35:55.571 --> 35:57.311
What is he talking about?

35:57.406 --> 36:01.570
Look, I know this doesn't
make any sense,

36:03.245 --> 36:05.236
but you're gonna die
in half an arn.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.868
And there's nothing I can
do to stop that.

36:07.958 --> 36:09.949
What...

36:10.044 --> 36:11.659
What do you mean?

36:11.754 --> 36:14.336
I'm not gonna die.

36:14.423 --> 36:16.004
Yes, you are.

36:16.091 --> 36:17.831
Listen, Crichton, are you in
some kind of trouble?

36:17.926 --> 36:19.962
Who is this fek?
Is he making you do this?

36:20.054 --> 36:23.421
If you untie me, I can
help you. I always do.
Can you just...

36:27.436 --> 36:29.347
( softly):
It is not Aeryn.

36:32.024 --> 36:34.015
Looks a lot like her.

36:34.109 --> 36:36.361
Okay.
( laughs )

36:37.321 --> 36:38.857
The... the joke's over.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.733
Okay? I...

36:40.824 --> 36:44.157
l was stupid to take it
this seriously, 'cause
it's a joke, right?

36:44.244 --> 36:46.735
You... you have to stop,
because”.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.741
because you can't kill me.

36:49.458 --> 36:51.039
You...

36:51.126 --> 36:52.991
you can't.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.431
No.

37:11.605 --> 37:13.266
No, I can't.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.348
I can.

37:15.442 --> 37:18.024
( screaming )
No!

37:18.112 --> 37:19.977
Now cross her over.

37:20.072 --> 37:21.562
(gasping and groaning)

37:28.414 --> 37:30.245
Frell.

37:30.332 --> 37:31.947
( gaspsing )

37:48.642 --> 37:53.102
I don't know if it's
Crichton's child.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.179
The frell with your drugs.
They're not working.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.230
No. You'll kill her!

37:58.652 --> 38:01.644
Who is the father?

38:03.449 --> 38:07.158
On Vendrall... I met a...
ugh... a man.

38:30.893 --> 38:32.724
There is no Lechna.

38:34.855 --> 38:36.516
I made him up.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.934
Just Crichton.

38:49.703 --> 38:52.911
Only ever... Crichton.

38:55.167 --> 38:57.249
Just him.

39:06.345 --> 39:12.511
Dadayo qillna frazac,
charn, Oza-Maga.

39:12.601 --> 39:14.717
Oza-Maga.

39:16.396 --> 39:18.261
Has she said it yet?

39:18.357 --> 39:20.268
Be quiet, I can't hear.

39:20.359 --> 39:24.227
Oza-Maga. Kilay ti partree.

39:25.322 --> 39:30.112
Kilay ti partree. Katratzi.

39:30.202 --> 39:32.318
Katratzi?

39:32.412 --> 39:34.152
That's it, Stark.

39:34.248 --> 39:37.115
That's the name of the
base, Katratzi.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.658
Where is it?

39:41.255 --> 39:43.621
Seat of Scarran power.

39:44.800 --> 39:49.464
Small. It's Fortified.
It's dangerous.

39:49.555 --> 39:53.639
Disguises its presence...

39:53.725 --> 39:59.311
by mirroring the orbit of one
of the moons of Trilask.

39:59.398 --> 40:03.266
Trilask.
-Trilask... Katratzi...

40:03.360 --> 40:07.353
Yes, I know that planet.

40:08.490 --> 40:11.357
( Stark softly chants )

40:11.451 --> 40:12.952
John.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.735
We can go.

40:49.448 --> 40:52.110
Morrock:
Peacekeeper, wake up.

40:55.829 --> 40:57.160
How did you...

40:57.247 --> 40:59.408
I watched the sequence codes.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.711
Are you sure?

41:10.344 --> 41:12.335
At the same time, then.

41:21.772 --> 41:23.558
Thank you.

41:23.649 --> 41:26.641
What for?
-For doing this with me.

41:28.570 --> 41:31.061
I don't wanna be their
test stallik.

41:31.156 --> 41:35.820
No. No. Neither do I.

41:35.911 --> 41:39.574
Anyway, what other choice
do I have?

41:40.666 --> 41:44.409
But your child.
Aren't you afraid?

41:44.503 --> 41:47.666
I'd rather be dead than
let them have it.

41:48.757 --> 41:51.248
Is it really his?

41:51.343 --> 41:53.299
The man you loved?

41:56.306 --> 41:58.342
Does these really
make you tired?

41:58.433 --> 42:01.220
At first. But then...

42:02.688 --> 42:07.557
You know, I had such incredible
dreams for my child.

42:07.651 --> 42:09.858
It's impossible not to.

42:09.945 --> 42:11.776
How she was going to
change the world,

42:11.863 --> 42:14.946
how she was gonna look
after me when I was old.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.694
They were so foolish.

42:16.785 --> 42:18.616
Not foolish.

42:19.913 --> 42:22.120
I had the same dreams.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.741
Is it his?

42:28.213 --> 42:30.545
Is it Crichton's child?

42:32.008 --> 42:33.589
Come here.

42:40.267 --> 42:42.724
Did you really have a child?

42:44.312 --> 42:46.689
I told you, I...

42:46.773 --> 42:49.185
had six pregnancies.

42:50.318 --> 42:51.899
Only three of them survived.

42:51.987 --> 42:53.818
(gasps )

42:53.905 --> 42:56.191
I want the truth from you.

42:56.283 --> 43:00.617
I know that these pills
won't kill me. I know that
you're their spy.

43:00.704 --> 43:04.447
So I wanna know the truth.
Have you even had one child?

43:04.541 --> 43:07.908
Have you even given birth
to one child?

43:09.379 --> 43:11.244
The truth.

43:12.382 --> 43:14.088
No.

43:14.176 --> 43:15.461
( snapping )

43:18.388 --> 43:20.424
Good.

43:20.515 --> 43:22.676
Then I orphan...

43:22.768 --> 43:24.349
no one.

43:35.906 --> 43:37.942
Crichton:
We're back.
Open the hangar doors.

43:38.033 --> 43:39.489
And we know where that
Scarran base is.

43:39.576 --> 43:41.817
No time, John. There's a
Command Carrier on the way.

43:41.912 --> 43:44.244
We've got you in the Docking Web
and we're about to Starburst.

43:44.331 --> 43:45.696
Got it.

43:45.791 --> 43:48.453
We will go as slow as we can,
but you better buckle
down in there.

43:48.543 --> 43:51.330
Starting Starburst
countdown grid.

43:53.381 --> 43:55.246
Why is nothing ever
easy with you?

43:55.342 --> 43:57.253
I wish I knew.
-Hold on, John.

43:57.344 --> 43:59.005
Pilot, Starburst...

43:59.095 --> 44:00.346
now.

44:05.685 --> 44:08.518
We've set a course
for Katratzi.

44:08.605 --> 44:13.144
They've been informed of your
condition and there is a
surgeon on hand.

44:18.490 --> 44:22.233
Now, Djancaz-Bru...

44:22.327 --> 44:25.660
you haven't listened,
and you haven't helped.

44:26.414 --> 44:28.871
And I'm running out of time.

44:29.751 --> 44:32.333
So I'm gonna forget about you.

44:32.420 --> 44:35.036
I am now willing to make
a deal with anyone,

44:35.131 --> 44:38.749
with anything,
to save my child.

44:40.262 --> 44:42.844
Not because I can,

44:43.849 --> 44:46.215
but because I have to.
