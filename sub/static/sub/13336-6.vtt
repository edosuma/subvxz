WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.200
.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.000
We're back.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.440
Let's fucking do this.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.560
Come on!

00:16.440 --> 00:17.520
More pulling.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.520
More getting mortal.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.200
More fights.

00:23.880 --> 00:26.560
Get your fucking hands off me!

00:26.640 --> 00:28.400
Things are about to go crazy.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.400
It'll just be carnage.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.120
What the fuck?!

00:35.200 --> 00:37.680
There's so much chemistry
between me and Aaron.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.840
This isn't gonna end well.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.440
The divide is back.
Boys against girls.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.480
I need to go and speak to Dan.

00:47.560 --> 00:52.360
Aaron's enjoying the freedom
cos he's actually going on the pull.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.840
This blonde beauty
came out of nowhere.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.680
Buzzin'.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.360
This is my insecurities,
and I need to make them go away.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.520
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.920
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.120
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

01:14.200 --> 01:18.760
I'm a natural beauty.
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.560
I'm totally crackers, me, like.
I'm preened to perfection.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.040
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:25.120 --> 01:29.280
I'm fake, flirty and I've got FFs.
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.680
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:42.960 --> 01:46.440
Last night me and Kyle
got in another stupid argument,

01:46.520 --> 01:49.800
and I feel like absolute shit.
I need to go and see the girls.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.800
Oh, well I hate meself again.
Why?

01:54.880 --> 01:56.480
For crying again last night.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.960
Kyle might not think that
all these arguments mean anything,

02:00.040 --> 02:02.840
but they build up
and they make us feel really bad.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.680
I just can't deal with it.

02:04.760 --> 02:08.560
I was saying to Kyle, "I don't feel
as though... I make you happy."

02:08.640 --> 02:12.840
And that I just cause a load of grief
and hassle that you just don't need.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.160
I feel like you need to
stop being stupid.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.200
Kyle literally likes you so much
and I can tell that.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.680
I'm starting to worry about
Kyle and Holly.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.160
I don't want them falling
into a toxic relationship.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.840
I feel like it's when you're on
the verge of happiness...

02:27.920 --> 02:30.720
...it all comes crashing down.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.760
So, have you and Gary talked yet?

02:32.840 --> 02:36.000
No, we're done now.
I think we're done with each other.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.200
It's not just a me thing,
it's a mutual thing. Mm-hmm.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.120
I'm still not talking to Gary.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.640
We were never friends in the
first place, so why be friends now?

02:44.720 --> 02:46.760
He can't have Lillie
as a girlfriend,

02:46.840 --> 02:48.960
and still have me
as his "best friend".

02:49.040 --> 02:50.680
It just doesn't work that way.

02:50.760 --> 02:56.000
I am so done with wasting any of
my energy even speaking to him.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.480
This will never, ever,
ever be resolved.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.080
Aye, and not falling out with her.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.760
Me and Gary are fighting a losing
battle against Marnie and Charlotte.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.280
If that's how they wanna act,
then fuck them.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.440
I feel bad for necking on
when she's got a boyfriend,

03:28.520 --> 03:31.440
but she's sorting things out,
and that's for the best.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.360
No, fuck that. Why should I?

03:37.960 --> 03:40.160
You pulled!

03:40.240 --> 03:42.840
Last night I brought a lad
back to the shag pad,

03:42.920 --> 03:47.240
and things got a little bit freaky.
In fact, my jaw's still killing.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.120
What?

03:52.200 --> 03:56.080
I was like,
"I'm the Prince of the castle."

03:56.160 --> 04:01.120
"As the King,
I command you to suck my dick."

04:01.200 --> 04:03.960
(laughs)

04:04.040 --> 04:05.520
Nathan has done us proud,

04:05.600 --> 04:08.160
and I wanna be the first one
to shake his hand.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.160
Unless it's got come on,
then I will not be shaking it.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.840
There's a bit of come there.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.720
Right, I'm going to leave you
to sort yourself out.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.120
Bye!
Bye, King.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.640
(laughs)

04:22.080 --> 04:24.440
(phone rings)

04:26.680 --> 04:28.240
Hello.
"Hi, Charlotte."

04:28.320 --> 04:29.400
Hi, Anna.

04:29.480 --> 04:33.160
The phone rings, it's obviously
gonna be Anna and it's gonna be work.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.960
After last night,
I am not in the mood for graft.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.800
What?

04:42.880 --> 04:45.040
Eh? We're going to Hamburg!

04:45.920 --> 04:47.240
We are at work.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.160
But we're not just at work anywhere.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.480
Where we going?

04:52.560 --> 04:54.240
Hamburg in Germany.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.400
What?!Shut up, man!
Yeah.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.480
I am so excited to be going
to Hamburg. Bring it on.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.640
We're leaving like literally now.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.560
Hamburg crew! Hamburg crew!

05:05.640 --> 05:07.960
We've got no time to prepare
or do fuck all.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.080
We need to pack
and get to Hamburg now.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
Here we come!

05:17.440 --> 05:19.560
Get out the house
and get to the airport.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.440
Hamburg, we're coming for you.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.880
They sell giant beers over there.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.920
That means I get drunk even quicker.
Come on, Hamburg!

05:33.920 --> 05:35.960
The Germany word for ill is crank.

05:36.040 --> 05:39.000
So technically,
Germany is gonna be crank!

05:39.080 --> 05:40.920
(laughter)

05:42.320 --> 05:43.720
Come on then, bitches!

05:43.800 --> 05:48.120
(in German accent)Come us bitch
in airport! To Germany!

05:50.840 --> 05:53.720
How long's the flight?
One and a half, I'm guessing.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.720
One hour thirty?
Oh, shit, there's Marnie.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.120
We weren't fast enough to check in.
Marnie's here.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.840
(all greeting Marnie)

06:01.920 --> 06:03.560
You all right?

06:03.640 --> 06:06.960
You're meant to leave your baggage
at check in. Fuck's sake.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.680
Alreet?
(laughs)

06:08.760 --> 06:12.280
There's absolutely no way I was
gonna miss this trip to Hamburg.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.560
But it's so awkward with Aaron,
I don't know where to look.

06:16.760 --> 06:20.280
Aaron looks mortified. His trip's
now gone from a ten to a three.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.720
I need to tell the girls
what happened last night with Dan.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.240
So, what happened?

06:29.480 --> 06:32.520
I can't believe it.
Dan's finished Marnie.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.600
I honestly thought
they'd be able to work things out.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.680
She is gonna be devastated.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.440
Dan splitting up with us
was fucking awful.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.560
He wasn't just angry,
he was so upset.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.680
I don't know how
I could do that to him.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.240
How do you feel? Are you sad?

06:58.320 --> 07:01.560
I was really sad when I told him,
we were both crying.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.720
The best thing
is to keep Aaron at arm's length.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.400
I've got nothing to say to him.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.720
Let's just see
what happens in Germany.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.440
I'm so glad that all the girls
are back together.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.240
When you're going through a break up
you wanna be with your friends,

07:19.320 --> 07:22.400
and Germany is the right thing
for Marnie right now.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.200
Germany!
(all cheering)

07:31.280 --> 07:34.360
We've touched down in Hamburg.
Ich liebe dich!

07:34.440 --> 07:37.240
In me vagine! Buzzin'!

07:40.440 --> 07:43.080
We get to the apartment
and I'm fuckin' buzzin'.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.280
Anna has pulled it out the bag.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.080
(screaming)

07:50.800 --> 07:53.360
Why aye. I got a really
weird feeling in my fanny!

07:53.440 --> 07:54.640
A twinge.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.560
I've got a really good feeling
about Hamburg.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.840
Go on then.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.920
This little number,
or this little number?

08:11.320 --> 08:15.040
The girls are in the girls' room
and the boys are in the boy's room.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.520
I can feel a divide
already starting to creep up on us.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.640
So, have you spoken to Aaron yet?
No.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.000
Oh, my God!

08:27.080 --> 08:30.880
Charlotte's telling us that Aaron
has admitted when I've been gone

08:30.960 --> 08:33.800
that he has no intentions
of doing anything with me.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.600
He doesn't give a shit,
it's always on his terms.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.960
I'm fucking furious.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.800
I can't even contain the anger.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.840
The way that Aaron's treated Marnie

08:42.920 --> 08:45.480
is the way that Gary's treated me
for four years.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.240
Fucked with our heads
and made us really believe

08:48.320 --> 08:51.920
that they wanna be with us,
when really it's just bullshit.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.800
The lads are getting ready
for a mint night out,

08:56.880 --> 08:59.400
but before that
we've got to get ready for work.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.640
How you feeling about Marnie
being here?

09:01.720 --> 09:04.240
Did she say hello,
seeing as she didn't say bye.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.560
Nah, did she fuck.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.440
I haven't spoken to Marnie,

09:07.520 --> 09:10.800
so I don't know if she's still
with Dan or if she's single.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.840
Holly told me that Marnie's
actually single now.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.920
I'm not really bothered me.
She can stay single, I'm single.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.200
I feel bad for Marnie.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.600
I hope she doesn't think
things are gonna happen between us.

09:29.560 --> 09:32.880
All Aaron wants to do is have
a good night and pull some birds.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.640
But now Marnie's back and she's
single, no way that is happening.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.440
Hands in.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.400
Wicked.
(laughs)

09:43.440 --> 09:46.520
Tonight is the first German edition
of Tash-On Tours.

09:46.600 --> 09:50.080
Even though me and Aaron aren't
talking to Charlotte and Marnie,

09:50.160 --> 09:54.000
hopefully tonight we can keep it
together and actually get work done.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.480
Hi!

09:56.560 --> 09:58.200
(cheering)

09:58.280 --> 10:01.000
Tonight I'm taking charge of work.

10:01.080 --> 10:04.320
I'm gonna show these Germans
how it's fucking done.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.040
Yes!
Yes!

10:11.560 --> 10:13.240
(indistinct shouting)

10:13.320 --> 10:16.720
Right, guys!
One line here, one line here.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.000
The first game is the Sausage Game.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.800
There's not a more fitting place
than Hamburg.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.920
Right, guys.
Basically we've got Team Chloe.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.800
And on this side,
we've got Team Charlotte.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.760
The Sausage Game.
I'm gonna be fucking good at this.

10:30.840 --> 10:31.920
(both) Go!

10:32.000 --> 10:34.520
(cheering)

10:40.760 --> 10:43.120
Surprise, surprise. I've won.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.560
I've always known
how to handle a sausage.

10:45.640 --> 10:46.880
(laughter)

10:46.960 --> 10:50.680
So the next game we're gonna play
is called Einstein or Two.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.320
We're gonna have Marnie and Aaron.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.960
I'm up against Aaron, great. I need
to make sure that I fuckin' win.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.920
Stand behind the guy.
Stand behind the guy.

11:00.920 --> 11:05.080
Aaron and Marnie are paired up with
the Germany versions of each other.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.200
This is weird.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.640
(cheering)

11:15.200 --> 11:18.600
It looks like Marnie isn't happy
with this top knot imposter,

11:18.680 --> 11:20.880
cos she's poured the drink
all over him.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.360
Aaron is the winner!

11:23.920 --> 11:25.880
Get in!
(cheering)

11:25.960 --> 11:29.560
Time to get fucking wasted!

11:29.640 --> 11:33.520
The Germans are fucking loving
the Geordies. You're welcome, Anna.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.480
To be fair, there's a few fit birds.
I know I'm supposed to be at work,

11:42.560 --> 11:44.960
but it is a singles night
and I'm single.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.000
Looking at Aaron now,
he fucking disgusts us.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.920
I don't know how I ever seen
anything in him. He's rank.

12:03.920 --> 12:07.600
Marnie isn't happy that I'm still
chatting to this little fittie.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.120
I understand she's upset,

12:09.200 --> 12:11.720
but I'm single.
I'm not doing anything wrong.

12:11.800 --> 12:16.720
I despise Aaron
with a deep venom passion!

12:16.800 --> 12:20.480
I'm just so annoyed at meself.
The fact that I've lost Dan

12:20.560 --> 12:23.520
over someone like Aaron
who's sick, evil, nasty,

12:23.600 --> 12:24.960
and got a shit top knot.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.200
He has broke up your relationship
for nothing.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.000
Holly's saying that I'm in the wrong,

12:33.080 --> 12:36.640
but Marnie was the one in a
relationship when we kissed, not me.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.040
She kissed you.
Exactly.

12:44.120 --> 12:48.160
Can I fucking hear Aaron
trying to justify what he's caused?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.520
That's bullshit, it's unjustifiable.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.760
I don't want anything
to fuckin' do with him!

12:55.080 --> 12:58.120
I literally... Argh! Charlotte!

12:58.200 --> 13:01.840
Marnie has lost it. I'm doing me
best to try and hold her back,

13:01.920 --> 13:04.640
but she's got one target,
and that's Aaron.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.280
How fuckin' dare he!

13:07.360 --> 13:09.480
How dare he turn this around!

13:09.560 --> 13:12.960
Who turned it around?
I haven't said fuck all!

13:13.040 --> 13:17.080
I feel like I'm losing me mind.
I can't contain this anger any more.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.680
Marnie, Marnie, Marnie!

13:19.760 --> 13:22.320
(all shouting)

13:22.400 --> 13:24.840
Marnie charges at us
like a woman possessed.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.200
Fuck off, love.
You're the cheat, not me.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.320
(all shouting)

13:29.400 --> 13:31.720
Why won't people
just let us get hold of him!

13:31.800 --> 13:33.160
Let go of me now!

13:33.240 --> 13:34.560
Marnie...
Get off me!

13:34.640 --> 13:37.880
I feel like if I let Marnie go,
she would actually kill Aaron.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.200
She's biting and scratching me,
and I've done fuck all wrong.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.160
Get off me!

13:44.240 --> 13:46.000
I will... Get off me!

13:46.080 --> 13:48.400
I know you wanna... Marnie, stop!

13:48.480 --> 13:51.800
My balls got caught
in the crossfire. Cheers, Marns.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.160
Get off us now!

13:53.240 --> 13:55.800
Marnie left the house to
sort things out.

13:55.880 --> 13:59.400
I was free and single to do what
I want. I never made any promises.

13:59.480 --> 14:02.800
But now her boyfriend's dumped her,
I'm the one in the wrong?

14:11.520 --> 14:14.000
Marnie is flipping out
and I understand why.

14:14.080 --> 14:17.520
When she was in a relationship,
Aaron was trying to pursue her.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.200
Now that she's single,
he pulls somebody else.

14:26.440 --> 14:30.040
Aaron never said, "Marnie,
if you break up with your boyfriend,

14:30.120 --> 14:32.800
I'll get with you."
Aaron is not in the wrong here.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.800
Right, OK.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.960
I am so frustrated that
we are arguing

14:42.040 --> 14:45.320
over somebody else's argument.
We argue enough on our own.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.280
Why the fuck are you arguing with me
over their fucking argument?!

14:57.920 --> 14:59.360
Come here.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.840
(indistinct sobbing)

15:01.920 --> 15:05.120
I'm fucking so angry.
But I'm also devastated.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.640
I will never, ever, ever
speak to Aaron again.

15:07.720 --> 15:11.720
I have lost... the love of my life.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.280
Over... over that.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.960
I feel like I'm literally watching
me and Gary a few years back.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.880
I don't wanna argue,
but when I look at him, I see you.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.120
This is just all lies.
It's different.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.880
No, that's not the case, Gary.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.160
I'm watching a girl whose head
has been repeatedly fucked

15:35.240 --> 15:37.000
by a boy who couldn't care less.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.760
You used to be exactly the
same person.We're not though...

15:40.840 --> 15:43.520
This whole time,
four years has been a lie.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.200
It hasn't though.
It has! Yes, it has.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.960
I'm gonna be here for Marnie 100%

15:49.040 --> 15:51.400
because I know
what she's going through,

15:51.480 --> 15:54.360
and I know exactly
what arseholes them two lads are.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.880
Don't know how Aaron and Marnie
arguing brings back me and you.

15:57.960 --> 16:01.600
Any reason for Charlotte to get angry
with me, she will jump on it.

16:01.680 --> 16:04.160
That's why, all of a sudden,
she's Team Marnie.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.880
I... fucking hate this house.

16:11.320 --> 16:15.200
Fuck knows what these Germans think
of us. Let's forget it happened.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.040
Tash-On Tours was really good
until Marnie and Aaron had a fight.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.560
Hopefully it won't be awkward
in the club.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.600
Me and Chloe are in
an awkward position

16:32.680 --> 16:35.320
because we get along
with the boys and the girls.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.800
We just want everyone to be united.

16:45.080 --> 16:49.240
Never in all of my entire life
have I ever felt this much of a mug.

16:49.320 --> 16:53.160
Aaron's took me for a total idiot
and I'll never forgive him for it.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.160
I feel closer than ever to Marnie

16:57.240 --> 16:59.920
because we've been through
the same thing,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
and we both know exactly
what it's like to be fucked over.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.160
Charlotte and Marnie
encourage each other.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.800
Why would me and Gary
wanna be with either of them

17:16.880 --> 17:18.520
when they behave like that?

17:26.400 --> 17:29.400
When Charlotte was with Mitch,
I gave space to move on.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.600
Now I'm with Lillie,

17:30.680 --> 17:33.600
she needs to do the same
and accept that I've moved on.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.920
I thought me and Holly
were in a good place,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.040
but tonight's argument
clearly states that we're not.

17:53.960 --> 17:57.240
Kyle is just repeating back to me
everything that I've said.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.840
I wanna keep my mouth shut
and have a good night.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.760
I've had way too much to drink.
I can barely see anything.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.080
Chloe dances like
an injured Daddy Long Legs.

18:16.160 --> 18:19.280
There's limbs everywhere.
I fucking love her.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.720
Come on! Keep on! Keep on!

18:32.880 --> 18:35.800
I've just seen the girl
from Tash-On Tours,

18:35.880 --> 18:39.160
so that means I can pick up
where I left off. She's mine.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.160
I'm about to go into semi-retirement,

18:43.240 --> 18:46.720
but I'm gonna have to dust off
my boots and help Aaron pull.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.400
I don't speak German, but necking on
is the same in every language.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.440
The second that Marnie leaves,
there Aaron goes again pulling.

19:00.520 --> 19:03.120
What the fuck is wrong
with his tiny little brain?

19:04.480 --> 19:06.800
(yells)

19:06.880 --> 19:11.680
Aaron's necking on with a bird.
It's only taken him 14,842 minutes.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.880
Job done. I've pulled a fit lass,

19:14.960 --> 19:17.760
and Marnie couldn't be further away
from my mind.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.640
My aim is to bridge
the boy/girl divide

19:22.720 --> 19:26.080
and get Chloe and Nathan
to get into each other.

19:32.520 --> 19:35.600
I'm kissing her? But I like it.

19:35.680 --> 19:38.320
This is Chloe,
this shouldn't be happening.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.640
She's like my sister. Ew.

19:44.840 --> 19:48.600
I dunno why it's weird
watching Nathan and Chloe neck on.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.040
It's just... weird.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.280
One minute I'm dancing round
like a loon,

19:55.360 --> 19:58.840
and the next I'm fucking necking
with Nathan. What the fuck?!

20:00.120 --> 20:03.680
This is gonna be awkward!

20:05.360 --> 20:07.880
Fair play to Nathan,
he's a canny good kisser.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.520
I have seen some bad things
in this house,

20:15.600 --> 20:21.000
but this, Nathan and Chloe kissing,
is knocking me physically sick.

20:22.720 --> 20:26.240
To be fair, Chloe actually looks like
she's really enjoying it,

20:26.320 --> 20:27.760
so aye. Great.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.520
After everything that went down,

20:39.600 --> 20:42.160
it's actually turned out
to be a good night.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.080
But I'm fucked,
so let's get back to the apartment.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.680
I thought Marnie kicking off
would spoil the whole night.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.280
When she fucked off home,
we had a wicked night.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.760
I've got back the apartment, I'm
fucking mortal, so I'm off to bed.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.360
Are you fucking... No!

21:23.440 --> 21:26.800
I don't take criticism very kindly,
especially when it's a lie.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.040
So fuck off, Chloe,
cos I'm a mint kisser.

21:29.120 --> 21:33.200
I gave Chloe the best kiss of
her life. It was like velvet.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.920
(laughter)

21:35.000 --> 21:37.480
Nathan's one of the boys,
and if it was any of us,

21:37.560 --> 21:40.440
he'd do exactly the same
by ripping the piss out of her.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.360
After everything that happened
tonight, Marnie kicking off,

21:48.440 --> 21:52.440
Chloe and Nathan necking on, the one
image that will stick in my head

21:52.520 --> 21:56.560
is Nathan standing there in his
little Y-fronts. Please go to bed.

22:00.760 --> 22:01.960
(Holly sobs)

22:02.040 --> 22:04.400
Me and Holly
are lying in bed together...

22:05.800 --> 22:08.400
...and out of nowhere,
she just starts crying.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.320
I don't know what I've done wrong.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.600
Me and Kyle haven't been
seeing each other that long,

22:18.680 --> 22:22.120
and the fact that we live together,
in each other's pockets 24/7,

22:22.200 --> 22:24.840
is putting a massive strain
on our relationship.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.880
I don't know how long
it can go on for.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.920
Guten morgen.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.320
Last night things got out of control.
Marnie went berserk with Aaron,

22:45.400 --> 22:48.440
and to top things off,
Nathan and Chloe were necking on.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.560
Was Chloe upstairs,
or was it just you?Just me.

22:51.640 --> 22:54.000
(laughs)

22:54.080 --> 22:57.440
The lads are griefing us about
getting with Chloe last night.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.800
It's another tally on my scoreboard.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.280
Enough of me and Chloe.

23:01.360 --> 23:04.320
What the fuck happened last night
with you and Marns?

23:04.400 --> 23:05.800
I literally don't know.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.720
"You led me on, blah, blah, blah."

23:09.800 --> 23:12.840
"You flirted with me,
you spoilt my relationship."

23:19.280 --> 23:22.320
Marnie thinks that by kissing her,
I wanted to be with her.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.840
If I wanted to be with her
I would have just said.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.240
She took it the wrong way.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.880
(groans)

23:31.840 --> 23:32.960
I feel sick.

23:33.040 --> 23:35.000
I don't remember much of last night,

23:35.080 --> 23:37.680
but I was pretty drunk
cos I necked on with Nathan.

23:37.760 --> 23:41.800
The thing is he was the only
good looking boy in the club, so...

23:41.880 --> 23:45.120
Oh, no!
That's literally like my brother.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.120
Don't worry about it.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.720
I'm glad I didn't witness it,

23:48.800 --> 23:52.160
or else I would have gouged me
own eyeballs out with me toenails.

23:52.240 --> 23:55.520
Last night, something clicked
inside of us with Aaron.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.600
It was just like...
he actually disgusted us.

23:58.680 --> 24:01.680
Aaron only has respect for himself.
He's disgusting.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.360
I'm done being angry over him.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.920
I'm never gonna speak to him again.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.280
And if I'm honest, like,
it won't even bother us.

24:16.560 --> 24:20.240
I've woken up this morning and
I feel as though I'm just in limbo.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.680
Me and Kyle
aren't boyfriend and girlfriend,

24:22.760 --> 24:25.880
but I'm just so confused
as to where I stand.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.040
Holly's saying
she's sick of all the arguing,

24:37.120 --> 24:40.160
but I'm sick of it too.
I don't like to argue.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.920
I'm trying to sort me hangover out,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.320
and here comes the lad
who I necked on with.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.320
You fucking mounted me
like a fucking horse.(laughs)

24:56.400 --> 24:59.720
Like that.
Oh, no, I'm so bad!

24:59.800 --> 25:02.360
I thought it'd be really awkward
this morning,

25:02.440 --> 25:05.800
but it's actually not. He's a
really canny lad and a good friend.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.360
(laughs)

25:21.440 --> 25:24.280
The last people I wanna see
this morning is the girls.

25:24.360 --> 25:27.720
We need to do something fun to
take our mind off the arguments,

25:27.800 --> 25:29.400
and this is the perfect thing.

25:29.480 --> 25:32.120
Flying about Hamburg
in these little bad boys.

25:42.840 --> 25:46.920
The only time we can have fun
is when we're away from the girls.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.480
Everyone should be here,
flying round in these little cars,

25:50.560 --> 25:53.520
seeing the whole of Hamburg.
It's amazing.

25:59.120 --> 26:02.360
This is every lad's dream,
flying around in a go-kart

26:02.440 --> 26:03.840
and getting away with it.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.920
That was fucking wicked.
It was class.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.040
The girls and Nathan are off to the
funfair. I fucking love funfairs, me.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.640
This fair is amazing.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.920
It's colourful, it's bright,
it's moving round in circles.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.440
It's even got a good fucking smell.
This is gonna be a great day.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.360
Oh, my God.
This one looks like anal beads.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.280
Four to come on here.

26:40.320 --> 26:42.440
(screaming)

26:42.520 --> 26:43.920
Whoo!

26:47.000 --> 26:50.120
I'm about to spew my German guts
all over Chloe's lap.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.600
(laughs)

26:54.080 --> 26:57.920
I thought Scotty T was good, but that
was the fucking ride of me life.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.760
I haven't laughed so much in ages.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.920
These rides were exactly
what I've needed.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.160
I haven't laughed this much
in so long,

27:07.240 --> 27:10.080
and I just needed to be with
the girls and Nathan.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.200
Eins, dreins, treins, freins...

27:14.280 --> 27:16.680
As if this day
couldn't get any better,

27:16.760 --> 27:19.960
we are now in a beer market
about to drink mulled wine.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.920
Ah!
Whoo!

27:23.000 --> 27:26.320
To Hamburg!
(all) To Hamburg.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.320
After a wicked day of
taking my mind off things,

27:31.400 --> 27:34.760
we've gotta meet the girls. If they
think I'm gonna talk to them,

27:34.840 --> 27:36.680
they've got another thing coming.

27:38.440 --> 27:41.760
We get to Beerfest
and there's only word I can use

27:41.840 --> 27:45.320
to describe the girls
meeting the boys. Awks.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.920
All right? You good?

27:49.320 --> 27:51.760
All right, guys,
I think it's safe to say

27:51.840 --> 27:55.280
that Hamburg has been
a fucking disaster.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.520
I'm getting sick of this divide,
and I've missed the lads.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.080
It would have been fun
to do this all together.

28:01.160 --> 28:05.160
Tonight, we're gonna go for a meal
and come together as one

28:05.240 --> 28:08.880
for our last night.
Can everyone do that?

28:08.960 --> 28:11.280
Just a meal.
Yeah, yeah. Just a meal.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.400
Nathan's trying to
bring us together,

28:13.480 --> 28:16.040
but not even
the international peacekeepers

28:16.120 --> 28:18.520
could sort this shit out.

28:23.920 --> 28:27.840
We arrive at the restaurant. I don't
know what I want in my mouth first,

28:27.920 --> 28:30.240
a huge beer
or a massive juicy sausage.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.480
We're off to a good start.

28:37.560 --> 28:40.000
Everyone looks good
and they're having fun.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.560
And we're all sat on the same table.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.320
How am I supposed to read this?

28:48.400 --> 28:51.080
It's all in German,
I can barely speak English.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.000
Do you reckon?
Yeah, I know.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.200
Being in the full German spirit
as I am,

29:00.280 --> 29:02.440
I have ordered
so many German sausage

29:02.520 --> 29:05.360
that you could probably fit it
in all of our bum holes

29:05.440 --> 29:09.760
and all the girls' vaginas,
with some left over. Sausage Fest!

29:09.840 --> 29:12.280
(gags) Oh, nah.

29:15.720 --> 29:16.760
(gags)

29:16.840 --> 29:21.280
Well, that was a shit idea. It turns
out sausages are exactly like cocks.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.120
Not all of them taste good.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.440
Right, guys. Big cheers
to the last night in Hamburg.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.960
(cheering)

29:36.360 --> 29:38.040
For the guys, for the girls.

29:38.120 --> 29:41.560
The waiter is encouraging us to
get into these German outfits.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.720
And what the hell?
When in Hamburg!

29:45.360 --> 29:46.800
I don't know what it is,

29:46.880 --> 29:50.520
but the boys look horrendous
and the girls actually look fit.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.560
What the fuck
have we got ourselves in for?

29:54.640 --> 29:57.000
We look like fucking idiots.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.280
(German music)

30:02.520 --> 30:04.560
(mimics German singing)

30:11.640 --> 30:13.920
(cheering)

30:16.720 --> 30:18.600
I know that this is our last night,

30:18.680 --> 30:21.960
but I'm not having a good time
and I can't pretend that I am.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.160
I just wanna go back to
the apartment.

30:37.640 --> 30:42.160
No matter what I say or do just
doesn't seem to make Holly happy.

30:50.760 --> 30:54.120
Our bags are packed,
it's time to get back to Newcastle.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.160
Hamburg's been a bit weird.
The boy/girl divide's back,

31:03.240 --> 31:05.440
Marnie nearly attacked Aaron.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.840
I think we've gotta get back
to Newcastle.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.000
We're back.
We need to get back to Newcastle,

31:15.080 --> 31:16.640
get ready and get back on it.

31:24.640 --> 31:28.520
I can't wait to get to the house
and throw a Jagerbomb in me face.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.840
There's no place like home.

31:30.920 --> 31:34.080
Everyone is so excited
and can't wait to go out tonight.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.640
Whereas me,
couldn't think of anything worse.

31:41.440 --> 31:45.080
All I wanna do is go to bed.
I just can't face going out tonight.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.240
We're back on home turf.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.840
Time to get changed
and get the fuck back out.

31:55.440 --> 31:58.640
Hi.
Hi. I wondered where you were.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.680
Why you hiding?

32:00.760 --> 32:03.040
I've come to check on Holly
and she's in bed,

32:03.120 --> 32:06.160
and she's not in a good way.
Fuck. This is serious.

32:06.240 --> 32:09.760
At the minute, I just feel like
my head isn't in the right place.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.680
Sometimes he needs his space, and
this time I feel like I need mine.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.720
Like, I think I'm gonna go.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.800
When?
Tonight.

32:19.880 --> 32:22.600
I need to remember
why we've been fighting so hard

32:22.680 --> 32:26.600
to keep this relationship together,
because I've completely forgotten.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.800
Are you gonna tell anyone?
I can't tell Kyle because...

32:29.880 --> 32:32.280
...I feel as though
he might try and stop us.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.080
I can tell by how upset she is
how much this means to her.

32:40.160 --> 32:43.080
I hope she can get the
right head space that she needs,

32:43.160 --> 32:45.200
and that this was
the right decision.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.920
I need to work out whether,
you know,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.840
it's just this house
that's fucking up me and Kyle.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.680
Or, whether it's us as a whole.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.680
Whether we shouldn't be together.

32:56.760 --> 32:59.200
I feel really guilty
that I'm not gonna be here

32:59.280 --> 33:00.880
when Kyle gets back tonight.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.960
I just hope he realises
that I'm trying to do this for us.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.480
After Hamburg being a letdown,

33:14.560 --> 33:16.600
tonight I'm gonna go
fucking berserk.

33:16.680 --> 33:19.160
Me and Charlotte have decided
to not go out.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.640
We don't wanna spend any more time
with the lads than we have to.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.680
Us girls need to stick together.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.320
Tonight,
it's just the lads and Chloe.

33:31.400 --> 33:35.120
At least there'll be no atmosphere,
no arguments, we can just have fun.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.520
I'm actually buzzing about tonight.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.000
Hi.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.760
Thank god the others have gone.

33:43.840 --> 33:47.000
I can finally talk to the girls
and pack me stuff and leave.

33:47.080 --> 33:51.240
Holly isn't just staying in tonight.
She's gonna go home.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.640
What?

33:52.720 --> 33:55.240
I can't believe that Holly's
actually going.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.960
This is gonna be awful without her,
I really hope that she comes back.

33:59.040 --> 34:01.800
Is this down to you and Kyle
It's not him. It's me.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.040
I need to work out
if it's just this house

34:05.120 --> 34:07.120
that is, you know, fucking us up.

34:07.200 --> 34:10.680
Or whether it's the fact
that maybe we shouldn't be together.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.200
Me leaving is make or break.

34:15.280 --> 34:18.760
If I feel the same way as I do
outside the house

34:18.840 --> 34:22.080
as I do inside the house,
then we just can't be together.

34:22.160 --> 34:26.280
Right. I'll hopefully see you soon.
Please look after him.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.760
I'm gonna miss the house,
but trying to save

34:28.840 --> 34:32.480
whatever me and Kyle have got is
worth so much more than being here.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.120
I love yous.

34:40.680 --> 34:43.280
We get in town
and we're hitting House of Smith,

34:43.360 --> 34:44.920
and it's so good to be home.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.920
And without the girls here, we know
we've got a wicked night ahead of us.

34:53.200 --> 34:55.320
I know the lads have been dicks,

34:55.400 --> 34:58.120
but if you take sides,
it's a recipe for disaster.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.600
The boys have done nothing to me,
so I'm gonna have a mint night.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.600
I'm gutted Holly's not out,

35:15.680 --> 35:18.800
but I get to spend
some quality time with the lads.

35:24.640 --> 35:27.480
I'm having a really good time.
The lads are such a laugh.

35:37.240 --> 35:39.640
Chloe is a few Jagerbombs
short of a bar tab.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.320
She must have knocked a few back
tonight because she's all over us.

35:46.800 --> 35:50.040
I'm flirting with Aaron,
I think it's cos Scott's not here.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.280
And he's really fit.

35:54.400 --> 35:58.200
Chloe is all over Aaron.
The girl is as loose as a goose.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.840
Chloe wants Aaron bad and she
couldn't make it any more obvious.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.240
It's a good job
Marnie's not here to see it.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.920
We're trying to make ourselves
feel better with a pamper session,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.240
but nothing will take our minds
off Holly.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.640
Why aren't they
boyfriend, girlfriend?

36:23.720 --> 36:26.800
He should take the plunge
and ask her to be his girlfriend.

36:26.880 --> 36:30.560
We all know that Holly only wants
Kyle to make her his girlfriend.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.800
He needs to bite the bullet
and this will sort itself out.

36:33.880 --> 36:37.720
All this nonsense, all for
a relationship that isn't there.

36:37.800 --> 36:41.480
Why leave? To sort what out?
They're not even together.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.280
Kyle and Holly argue so much
and are so frustrated

36:44.360 --> 36:47.560
because they don't know
where they stand with each other.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.520
What the hell's going on with them?

36:53.720 --> 36:55.120
Yeah.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.840
Wicked night. Marnie wasn't there,

37:00.920 --> 37:03.520
and Chloe was all over us.
What more do you want?

37:05.680 --> 37:08.520
I haven't had such a good night
in a really long time.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.120
This has been fucking mint.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.360
We get back to the house
and I'm absolutely fucked.

37:24.440 --> 37:25.920
So it's the sofa tonight.

37:27.280 --> 37:30.720
Kyle doesn't care about
anything else than seeing Holly.

37:36.080 --> 37:39.480
I'm gonna have to tell Kyle about
Holly. This is bad.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.320
Home?

37:45.400 --> 37:48.720
I can't believe Holly's left
without saying goodbye to us.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.800
If I knew that, I wouldn't have
even went out with the lads.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.320
I'm hammered and I'm feeling flirty,
so I'm gonna snuggle with Aaron.

38:21.280 --> 38:25.160
Aaron must be absolutely smashed,
or have a death wish.

38:25.240 --> 38:29.640
He's spooning Chloe. As if this house
wasn't awkward enough.

38:40.320 --> 38:43.440
They're gonna regret
staying downstairs in the morning,

38:43.520 --> 38:45.720
but I don't want them
to catch cold.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.880
I'm creeping up the stairs, creepier
than Chloe creeping on Aaron.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.680
And that's pretty creepy.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.880
What the fuck am I seeing?

38:58.960 --> 39:01.040
Are my eyes deceiving me?

39:01.120 --> 39:04.600
Have I got drunk in me sleep?
Am I seeing things?

39:04.680 --> 39:07.240
Aaron and Chloe! Eh?!

39:15.000 --> 39:18.160
I know whether Marnie's
speaking to Aaron or not,

39:18.240 --> 39:21.320
she will be raging
that Chloe and Aaron are spooning.

39:25.600 --> 39:29.360
I've just got up to go to
the toilet, and what do I see?

39:29.440 --> 39:32.960
Aaron and Chloe snuggled up cosy
on the settee together.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.680
What the actual fuck?

39:37.840 --> 39:42.960
She's supposed to be me mate, and
I thought she'd have more respect.

39:47.280 --> 39:49.960
I don't know where the fuck I am,
or who this lass is?

39:50.040 --> 39:51.480
I need to get meself to bed.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.320
(groans)

39:57.400 --> 39:59.440
I stumble upstairs for the toilet.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.320
I open the lid and start to piss.

40:01.400 --> 40:04.920
The only fucking thing is, it's not
a toilet, it's the fucking bin.

40:06.800 --> 40:10.080
Fuck this. I can't even stand up.
I'm going to bed.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.120
(farts)

40:23.200 --> 40:24.960
I can't believe she's left.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.960
This house just won't be the same
without her.

40:56.160 --> 40:56.360
.
