(exclaiming)

00:16.138 --> 00:18.122
(school bell ringing)

00:20.826 --> 00:21.927
(Barney belches)

00:24.463 --> 00:26.965
(playing the blues)

00:28.634 --> 00:30.452
(playing the blues)

00:30.453 --> 00:32.454
(tires screeching)

00:33.573 --> 00:34.923
D'oh!

00:34.957 --> 00:36.274
(tires screeching)

00:36.308 --> 00:37.308
(grunts)

00:37.343 --> 00:39.344
(Homer moaning)

00:42.715 --> 00:43.982
What the...!
(screams)

00:45.317 --> 00:46.751
Hmm? (sniffs)

00:46.785 --> 00:49.320
Ew, cheap PVC smell.

00:49.355 --> 00:50.421
Oh, no.

00:50.456 --> 00:51.623
I'm an action figure!

00:51.657 --> 00:53.391
And I hate action.

00:53.425 --> 00:55.293
Hiddiley-ho,
articulated neighborino.

00:55.327 --> 00:56.628
Beautiful day, isn't it?

00:56.662 --> 00:59.264
Why, it's practically
mint on card.

00:59.298 --> 01:00.915
Shut up, Flanders!

01:00.950 --> 01:02.984
(screams)

01:06.138 --> 01:07.105
(laughs)

01:07.139 --> 01:08.473
This reality ain't all bad.

01:08.507 --> 01:09.640
(blows)

01:09.658 --> 01:11.392
Pastry power, activate.

01:11.427 --> 01:12.860
(laughs)

01:12.912 --> 01:14.195
(groans)

01:14.246 --> 01:15.196
Whoa!

01:15.247 --> 01:16.197
(whimpers)

01:16.248 --> 01:18.233
Beep, beep, beep.

01:19.802 --> 01:21.669
(belching)

01:24.506 --> 01:26.824
Homer, give me a yank.

01:26.859 --> 01:27.959
I'm lonely.

01:27.993 --> 01:28.993
Typical.

01:29.011 --> 01:31.029
Homer, this isn't
the way to the mall.

01:31.063 --> 01:33.881
The mall?
I thought you said Badass City!

01:33.933 --> 01:35.934
(kids screaming)

01:36.969 --> 01:38.186
(horn honks)

01:38.220 --> 01:39.621
Tokyo drift.

01:39.655 --> 01:41.306

All right, Dad!

01:54.236 --> 01:55.553

01:55.588 --> 01:57.455
(grunting)

01:57.489 --> 01:59.474
(sinister music plays)

02:03.195 --> 02:05.563
HOMER: Hey, put the
chicken one back on.

02:13.055 --> 02:15.056
Urgent message
from Nelson Muntz.

02:15.090 --> 02:16.124
Go on.

02:16.158 --> 02:17.492
Haw. Haw.

02:18.294 --> 02:19.594
(groans)

02:22.615 --> 02:26.000
Well, I am going to write
a note back to Mr. Muntz.

02:28.153 --> 02:29.404
Sorry about that.

02:29.438 --> 02:31.205
So, Mrs. Simpson,
the reason you're here...

02:31.240 --> 02:32.206
Let me guess.

02:32.241 --> 02:34.575
You need a field trip mom.

02:34.610 --> 02:36.260
A library volunteer?

02:36.295 --> 02:38.896
Someone to Purell the CPR dummy?

02:38.931 --> 02:41.616
Resusci-Kate is just fine,
thank you.

02:43.385 --> 02:45.086
We're here to talk about Bart.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.355
(sighs) What did he do now?

02:47.389 --> 02:49.657
Oh, today, I'm not here to talk
about what he did.

02:49.692 --> 02:51.092
I'm here to talk
about the future.

02:51.126 --> 02:53.795
(sighs)
What did he do in the future?

02:53.829 --> 02:55.663
I'm not sure
what he's planning,

02:55.698 --> 02:57.498
although there is a lot
of Internet chatter.

02:57.533 --> 02:59.250
I want to change
his character:

02:59.284 --> 03:00.601
less Dennis the Menace,

03:00.636 --> 03:01.903
more Casper the Ghost,

03:01.937 --> 03:03.271
if he were still alive.

03:03.305 --> 03:05.640
What if Bart took music lessons?

03:05.674 --> 03:08.743
Music classes could channel
his destructive impulses

03:08.777 --> 03:10.745
into artistic expression.

03:10.796 --> 03:13.247
I myself have been taking
flamenco lessons.

03:14.116 --> 03:16.084
(strums)

03:16.118 --> 03:18.252
(plays flamenco music)

03:18.287 --> 03:20.722
Got it, music lessons.

03:20.756 --> 03:21.756
(grunts)

03:24.193 --> 03:26.210
(playing)

03:31.934 --> 03:33.735
SKINNER (distantly):
Mother!

03:35.471 --> 03:36.571
(muffled):
Right. Right.

03:36.605 --> 03:37.939
Inside.

03:39.341 --> 03:41.526
Oh, stupid clog.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.782
(gasps) My head hairs!

03:47.816 --> 03:49.617
I'm bald!

03:49.651 --> 03:50.802
Get... get...

03:50.836 --> 03:52.170
get in there.

03:52.204 --> 03:53.404
(whoops)

03:55.057 --> 03:55.790
D'oh!

03:58.077 --> 03:59.243
(grunts)

03:59.278 --> 04:00.411
Aw, damn it!

04:01.897 --> 04:03.164
MAN (over TV): Welcome back...
(audience applauds)

04:03.198 --> 04:05.700
to <i>America's Most Tattooed Baby.</i>

04:05.734 --> 04:08.202
Now, if the Lindblads can fit
just one more tattoo

04:08.237 --> 04:10.304
on baby Jennifer--
and she's getting pretty full,

04:10.339 --> 04:11.472
I can tell you that--

04:11.507 --> 04:14.542
they win the grand prize
of $100.

04:14.576 --> 04:15.977
So what'll it be?

04:16.011 --> 04:17.310
Walk away! Walk away!

04:17.346 --> 04:18.312
(shouting indistinctly)

04:18.346 --> 04:20.648
TV's gotten so lousy.

04:20.682 --> 04:22.750
Did you ever wonder
if hippopotamuses

04:22.785 --> 04:24.719
think that rhinos
are unicorns?

04:24.753 --> 04:26.821
TV's not so bad.

04:27.823 --> 04:29.574
Sweetie...

04:29.608 --> 04:31.242
did you ever think
of doing something

04:31.276 --> 04:33.161
a little more creative
with your time?

04:33.195 --> 04:34.796
If you're worried about
your Mother's Day present,

04:34.830 --> 04:35.830
it's in the works.

04:40.302 --> 04:43.204
I was thinking something
more artistic.

04:43.238 --> 04:44.839
Something musical.

04:44.873 --> 04:46.307
You could take advantage

04:46.341 --> 04:49.544
of a fantastic musician
living right here.

04:49.578 --> 04:51.579
(playing the blues)

04:55.250 --> 04:57.785
That's the kind of riff
you can aim for

04:57.820 --> 04:59.654
after years of practice.

04:59.688 --> 05:02.390
We start off with the
fun stuff: music theory.

05:02.424 --> 05:03.991
(giggles)

05:04.026 --> 05:05.660
Don't worry,
music theory's

05:05.694 --> 05:07.261
just a fancy word
for music math.

05:07.296 --> 05:08.312
(chuckles)

05:09.615 --> 05:10.798
MEL:
My dear boy,

05:10.833 --> 05:12.967
you undoubtedly think
of the slide whistle

05:13.001 --> 05:15.436
as merely a whistle
that slides.

05:15.471 --> 05:18.756
Let me disabuse you
of that misperception.

05:18.791 --> 05:20.792
(playing complex classical tune)

05:23.595 --> 05:24.579
Pass.

05:24.613 --> 05:26.597
Do you have any idea
how difficult...

05:26.632 --> 05:28.766
Bye, now.
(whistle sliding down)

05:28.801 --> 05:31.602
(playing complex classical tune)

05:31.637 --> 05:33.004
COMIC BOOK GUY:
Behold!

05:33.038 --> 05:35.506
From the pages of <i>Dune</i>
and <i>Dune Messiah,</i>

05:35.541 --> 05:37.375
Gurney Halleck's beloved zither:

05:37.409 --> 05:38.960
the baliset.

05:38.994 --> 05:41.496
(plays twanging, alien music)

05:41.530 --> 05:42.697
Pass.

05:42.731 --> 05:44.432
(clears throat)
When I die,

05:44.466 --> 05:47.885
you will carry on the tradition
of... the Frink-e-min.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.922
(plays electronic tones
that sound like Frink's voice)

05:53.125 --> 05:54.091
Pass.

05:54.126 --> 05:55.426
(dog howling)

05:55.460 --> 05:57.161
Ah, Mr. Homer.

05:57.196 --> 05:59.864
I see you are wearing
the bald man's beret.

05:59.898 --> 06:01.365
Is it that obvious?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.567
Oh, yes.

06:02.601 --> 06:04.101
The only thing that screams

06:04.136 --> 06:07.104
"I am hiding hairlessness" more
is a goatee.

06:07.139 --> 06:10.408
I'm as smooth as jazz.

06:10.442 --> 06:12.443
(scatting)

06:14.046 --> 06:16.747
Oh... my wife has never seen
my head naked.

06:16.782 --> 06:18.749
Maybe I should wear
a cowboy hat.

06:18.784 --> 06:20.184
A cowboy hat means

06:20.219 --> 06:22.653
"I'm ashamed of my small penis."

06:22.688 --> 06:25.106
Don't even ask me
what this means!

06:25.140 --> 06:26.874
(gunshots)
Yee-haw!

06:26.909 --> 06:29.010
I'm a-compensatin'!

06:29.044 --> 06:30.177
(gunshots)

06:30.212 --> 06:31.579
(beautiful piano music playing)

06:35.984 --> 06:38.052
(buzzer sounds)

06:38.086 --> 06:39.453
(Russian accent):
New student.

06:39.488 --> 06:40.454
Sit at piano.

06:40.489 --> 06:42.557
My daughter teach you.
You, mother!

06:42.591 --> 06:45.126
Come to kitchen and see
picture of my dead wife.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.827
That's okay. I...

06:46.862 --> 06:48.346
(laughs)
No, no, no, no.

06:48.380 --> 06:50.381
She is not dead in picture.

06:50.415 --> 06:52.250
Uh... she is dying.

06:52.284 --> 06:54.452
Let's go, Bart.

06:54.486 --> 06:56.487
(piano playing continues)

06:58.000 --> 07:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:05.998 --> 07:08.099
(Russian accent):
So, you want lesson?

07:08.133 --> 07:10.101
Yes. I want lesson.

07:10.135 --> 07:11.535
I accept your whip.

07:12.771 --> 07:15.106
BART:
<i>A girl who likes candy?</i>

07:15.140 --> 07:16.724
<i>Wow.</i>

07:19.119 --> 07:21.120
(playing beautifully)

07:23.523 --> 07:25.257
So, how much are lessons?

07:25.291 --> 07:27.359
I give you something you want...

07:27.393 --> 07:29.795
(voice deepens):
you give me something I want.

07:30.814 --> 07:32.998
I'm sorry,
did my voice go all evil?

07:33.032 --> 07:35.067
(chuckles) It is common
with Russian accent.

07:35.101 --> 07:37.636
You'd better be asking
for something PC:

07:37.670 --> 07:39.104
pie or cake.

07:39.139 --> 07:41.507
Here's my offer:
my daughter give lessons,

07:41.541 --> 07:43.108
you teach me to drive car.

07:43.143 --> 07:45.344
There might be
some nagging involved.

07:45.378 --> 07:46.345
Deal!

07:46.379 --> 07:48.347
Now we toast with vodka.

07:48.381 --> 07:49.314
(glass shatters)

07:49.349 --> 07:51.150
(gulps) Ah.

07:51.184 --> 07:52.417
(grunts)
(glass shatters)

07:52.452 --> 07:53.719
Now we drive!

07:53.753 --> 07:55.604
Huh?

07:56.940 --> 07:58.807
Homer, I recommend
getting drunk

07:58.842 --> 08:00.742
on my most
expensive beer:

08:00.777 --> 08:02.611
Duff Platinum.

08:02.645 --> 08:03.662
Hey, what the...?

08:03.696 --> 08:05.464
But I used the best label paste.

08:07.767 --> 08:11.904
Those two hairs were what
was left of my youth, Moe.

08:11.938 --> 08:15.774
Hey, come on, there's
sexy bald, like, um...

08:15.808 --> 08:17.776
Babar, king of the elephants.

08:17.810 --> 08:19.778
I read his books as a kid.

08:19.812 --> 08:21.647
He married his cousin, Celeste.

08:21.681 --> 08:23.115
That was my takeaway.

08:23.149 --> 08:26.652
Those royal elephants have
trainers to keep them in shape.

08:26.686 --> 08:28.954
Average schmoe like me,
forget it.

08:28.988 --> 08:31.240
Well, let me see
how bald you are.

08:31.274 --> 08:34.109
Whoa... whoa!
Dear Lord.

08:34.143 --> 08:35.110
Here. Oh.

08:35.144 --> 08:36.578
You need this more than I do.

08:36.613 --> 08:38.179
(grunts)

08:40.416 --> 08:41.582
(whimpers)

08:41.618 --> 08:44.586
Just... just what exactly
is this good for?

08:45.955 --> 08:47.656
(groaning)

08:47.690 --> 08:50.292
It's nice when something
you plan in your head

08:50.326 --> 08:53.078
for so long
comes to fruition.

08:54.097 --> 08:55.797
Where you going, Bart?

08:55.848 --> 08:56.932
Piano lesson.

08:56.966 --> 08:59.384
Ooh, piano lesson.

08:59.418 --> 09:01.036
We put two of
those guys up there

09:01.070 --> 09:03.038
just for using
a big word.

09:03.072 --> 09:04.990
"Caché" is not a big word.

09:05.024 --> 09:08.794
Clickety clack!
(yelling, groaning)

09:08.828 --> 09:10.145
Wait, wait.

09:10.196 --> 09:11.563
I'm not learning anything.

09:11.598 --> 09:13.165
I'm just going
'cause the teacher's pretty.

09:13.199 --> 09:14.433
Okay.

09:14.467 --> 09:16.268
But you'd better steal bananas
for all of us.

09:16.302 --> 09:17.436
I will!

09:17.470 --> 09:18.670
Let me go.

09:18.705 --> 09:21.440
I have a swim lesson
with a gorgeous lifeguard.

09:21.474 --> 09:22.441
What gender?

09:22.475 --> 09:24.109
You're not allowed to ask.

09:24.143 --> 09:25.444
Okay.

09:25.478 --> 09:26.812
Check your mirrors.

09:28.314 --> 09:30.682
Hands at 10:00 and 2:00.

09:30.717 --> 09:33.385
Slowly back out
of the driveway.

09:33.419 --> 09:35.437
(tires squeal, metal crunches)
Aah!

09:36.472 --> 09:37.472
Mmm...

09:39.125 --> 09:41.760
Daddy said I was
a accident.

09:43.029 --> 09:44.863
Okay, let's try again.

09:47.066 --> 09:48.834
(engine revs, tires squeal)

09:48.868 --> 09:51.186
(playing scales)

09:51.237 --> 09:52.821
That is so beautiful.

09:52.855 --> 09:53.822
Did you write it?

09:53.856 --> 09:55.324
These are scales.

09:55.358 --> 10:00.028
Now, memorize:
Every good Boris deserves farm.

10:00.063 --> 10:01.129
Let me try.

10:01.164 --> 10:04.566
Every good booger
deserves flicking.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.268
Your tongue is nimble,

10:06.302 --> 10:08.136
unlike sausage fingers.

10:08.171 --> 10:10.589
Sausage fingers!

10:10.623 --> 10:11.890
Do what I do.

10:11.924 --> 10:13.925

10:13.960 --> 10:15.394

10:59.939 --> 11:01.039
(gears grind)
Aah!

11:01.057 --> 11:02.424
What are you doing?

11:02.475 --> 11:03.925
I want to go backwards.

11:03.976 --> 11:05.644
Like Russian economy,
under Putin.

11:05.678 --> 11:07.679
(tires screech)

11:07.714 --> 11:09.881
Stop making Putin jokes.

11:09.916 --> 11:11.316
You sound like police...

11:11.351 --> 11:12.751
under Putin.
(siren whoops)

11:12.785 --> 11:14.803
Ugh. Speaking of police...

11:14.837 --> 11:16.438
I'm sorry, Officer.

11:16.472 --> 11:18.190
I believe my license is, uh...

11:18.224 --> 11:21.443
...somewhere in these pairs
of easy-fit blue jeans.

11:21.477 --> 11:23.111
Eh? Eh?

11:23.146 --> 11:26.698
That's not the way
American police do things.

11:26.732 --> 11:27.849
Finally.

11:27.884 --> 11:29.584
Someone who knows
what a traffic stop

11:29.619 --> 11:31.136
is really all about.

11:31.170 --> 11:34.139
Uh, Chief, don't you think
those jeans are a little tight?

11:34.173 --> 11:38.794
We're all not high-waisted
like you, Lou, okay?

11:38.828 --> 11:41.763
I'm just gonna lie down
in the backseat here.

11:41.798 --> 11:44.232
(grunts, chuckles)

11:44.267 --> 11:45.667
Okay.

11:45.701 --> 11:49.104
All right, the blue knight
is ready for action!

11:49.138 --> 11:50.138
(grunting)

11:55.711 --> 11:57.345
(sighs)
What's wrong?

11:57.380 --> 11:58.680
Every note you play

11:58.714 --> 12:01.483
sounds like dying animal
writhing on keys.

12:01.517 --> 12:02.617
Awesome!

12:02.652 --> 12:04.920
I just want to get more students

12:04.954 --> 12:07.456
and help my father
with his dream.

12:08.724 --> 12:10.358
Buying a limo.

12:10.393 --> 12:12.561
He could tell big shots
in the back that,

12:12.595 --> 12:14.596
no, they cannot smoke.

12:14.630 --> 12:16.898
Seriously,
I'm gonna make you proud.

12:16.933 --> 12:19.000
I have hidden talents.

12:19.035 --> 12:23.939
Oh, Bort, if only you make
such a miracle happen...

12:23.973 --> 12:27.509
I would love your
hands forever.

12:27.543 --> 12:30.979
(slowly playing notes)

12:31.013 --> 12:33.031
(intense classical music plays)
(horn honking)

12:46.245 --> 12:47.395
Wait a minute.

12:47.430 --> 12:48.797
You can't hear.

12:50.199 --> 12:52.534
(playing continues)

12:52.568 --> 12:55.203
I am so proud.

12:55.238 --> 12:58.573
I would've been happy
if Bart was just a piano mover.

12:58.608 --> 13:01.576
(audience applauds)

13:01.611 --> 13:02.911
Thank you.

13:02.945 --> 13:04.513
I owe it all to Zhenya.

13:04.547 --> 13:06.481
Can you teach my boys?

13:06.516 --> 13:08.150
But no tickling
the ivories.

13:08.184 --> 13:09.568
You treat them
with respect.

13:09.602 --> 13:11.603
Can you teach my monkey?
(grunting)

13:11.637 --> 13:13.972
Then I can deal
with the Musician's Union

13:14.006 --> 13:15.974
instead of the Humane Society.

13:16.008 --> 13:17.209
Much easier to muscle.

13:17.243 --> 13:19.711
Zhenya, I couldn't have
done it without you.

13:19.745 --> 13:20.946
(whispers):
And you.

13:23.483 --> 13:24.466
MARGE:
Bart!

13:25.801 --> 13:28.503
Bart, I've never been
so proud of you.

13:28.538 --> 13:31.406
Never, never, never!

13:31.440 --> 13:34.743
And now I'll always be
at home in a saloon.

13:34.777 --> 13:36.611
Something smells fishy.

13:36.646 --> 13:38.180
Yar, that would be me.

13:38.214 --> 13:39.414
But I agree.

13:39.448 --> 13:41.416
There's something
funny here.

13:41.450 --> 13:42.551
Is it me?

13:42.585 --> 13:44.069
No!
Oh...

13:47.588 --> 13:50.924
Hey, your baseball cap's one
plastic bump tighter than usual.

13:50.958 --> 13:51.925
What gives?

13:51.959 --> 13:54.027
Okay, guys, here's the deal.

13:54.061 --> 13:55.762
I've gone bald.

13:55.796 --> 13:56.996
(gasps)
(gasps)

13:57.031 --> 13:58.164
Then again,
who cares?

13:58.199 --> 14:00.066
Yeah, you already
landed a hot wife.

14:00.101 --> 14:01.935
That's the only reason
men evolved hair.

14:01.969 --> 14:03.069
What are you talking about?

14:03.104 --> 14:05.138
You lured Marge in
with your hair.

14:05.172 --> 14:06.673
You trapped her
with marriage.

14:06.707 --> 14:08.975
You skinned and field-gutted
her by having kids.

14:09.009 --> 14:10.877
Now she's mounted on
your wall for good,

14:10.911 --> 14:13.146
with fake glass eyes
and a rubber tongue.

14:13.180 --> 14:15.615
The way you put it,
it sounds so perfect,

14:15.649 --> 14:16.933
but it's not.

14:16.967 --> 14:18.635
You sound seriously depressed.

14:18.669 --> 14:20.503
Why don't we talk
about it over at Moe's?

14:20.538 --> 14:21.905
It's not even noon.

14:21.939 --> 14:23.590
Yeah, I've got
a watch, egghead.

14:24.909 --> 14:27.143
I couldn't help overhearing
your predicament.

14:27.178 --> 14:29.646
Mainly because
my hearing is so great.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.647
Who are you?

14:30.681 --> 14:32.649
The answer to your prayers.

14:32.683 --> 14:34.551
Are you my guardian angel?

14:34.585 --> 14:37.454
If so, can you turn a
pumpkin into a chariot?

14:37.488 --> 14:39.656
Even a used Camry would be okay.

14:39.690 --> 14:42.992
No, just a regular
hairless Joe like you.

14:43.027 --> 14:45.328
Been bald since I was 23.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.864
With the money I've saved,
I bought a yacht.

14:47.898 --> 14:49.199
Whoa...

14:49.233 --> 14:50.383
You're cool with it?

14:50.418 --> 14:52.318
I haven't even told my wife.

14:52.353 --> 14:53.920
You wait for
the right moment,

14:53.954 --> 14:56.156
you show her
that glorious dome,

14:56.190 --> 14:58.958
and then you rest it sweetly
on her bosom

14:58.993 --> 15:01.561
and let the kisses
flow like rain.

15:01.595 --> 15:04.063
Wow, is that what
your wife did?

15:04.098 --> 15:05.365
No wife.

15:05.399 --> 15:08.134
I just slept with
thousands of bald women.

15:08.169 --> 15:10.736
(laughing)

15:12.606 --> 15:13.907
(Marge humming)

15:13.941 --> 15:16.109
Caught your recital, Bart.

15:16.143 --> 15:17.777
Lisa, isn't it great

15:17.812 --> 15:19.679
to have a musical genius
in the family?

15:19.713 --> 15:21.214
Helen Lovejoy,

15:21.248 --> 15:23.516
you always have to stir the pot.

15:23.551 --> 15:26.186
Unlike you, when you make
your lumpy clam chowder.

15:26.220 --> 15:28.521
I guess Bart must be
a musical genius,

15:28.556 --> 15:31.024
because frauds are
always found out.

15:31.058 --> 15:32.759
Always.

15:42.236 --> 15:43.853
My work is done.

15:43.888 --> 15:47.207
Now to reward myself
with a case of wine.

15:47.241 --> 15:48.708
(doorbell buzzes)

15:49.877 --> 15:51.544
Hi, Zhenya.
I'm here for my lesson.

15:51.579 --> 15:53.513
Good to see you, my love.

15:53.547 --> 15:54.881
Sit on porch.

15:54.915 --> 15:56.182
Are there other
people in here?

15:56.217 --> 15:58.117
Because of your performance,

15:58.152 --> 16:00.119
I win many new students.

16:00.154 --> 16:01.621
♪

16:01.655 --> 16:04.724
me on. I got to learn my mom's
stripper music by midnight.

16:04.758 --> 16:06.693
But if I got you
all these students,

16:06.727 --> 16:07.894
shouldn't you be grateful?

16:07.928 --> 16:10.096
Oh, of course I'm grateful.

16:10.130 --> 16:12.398
Here is cushion for porch chair.

16:14.602 --> 16:17.303
Go to "bata boom."

16:17.338 --> 16:19.138
(humming)

16:19.173 --> 16:20.607
(grumbles)

16:20.641 --> 16:23.476
Mopped myself into a corner.

16:27.715 --> 16:29.365
Oh...
Mom,

16:29.416 --> 16:30.700
you'd still be proud of me

16:30.751 --> 16:32.485
if I couldn't
play the piano, right?

16:32.503 --> 16:33.870
Of course.

16:33.904 --> 16:37.106
But very, very, very angry

16:37.141 --> 16:38.825
at all the time I wasted.

16:38.859 --> 16:39.592
(gulps)

16:39.627 --> 16:40.910
Gulp? Was that a gulp?

16:40.945 --> 16:42.595
Are you getting
a sore throat?

16:42.630 --> 16:44.280
Let me give you
some castor oil.

16:44.315 --> 16:45.682
Hmm...

16:45.716 --> 16:47.717
(gulping)

16:49.954 --> 16:52.488
You'll need your voice
to say, "Thanks, Mom,"

16:52.523 --> 16:54.224
after your next recital.

16:54.258 --> 16:55.325
My wha...?

16:55.359 --> 16:56.492
I signed you up for

16:56.527 --> 16:59.712
the 10-And-Below Talent Show
next week. Huh?

16:59.747 --> 17:02.715
You know, I'm almost 11.
It's not really fair.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.817
Bart, when you were
on that stage,

17:04.852 --> 17:06.986
it felt like you were
pouring those notes

17:07.021 --> 17:08.655
right into my heart.

17:08.689 --> 17:10.522
Hey, one of those notes

17:10.558 --> 17:12.325
could go to your brain
and kill you.

17:12.358 --> 17:14.394
Are you sure you want
to take that chance?

17:14.428 --> 17:17.630
A proud mother
always does.

17:17.665 --> 17:18.731
(whimpers)

17:21.085 --> 17:22.819
First of all,
you're over ten years old.

17:22.853 --> 17:24.487
Second, you're clearly
Justin Bieber.

17:24.521 --> 17:27.123
That's another 25 bucks
we'll never see.

17:27.156 --> 17:28.491
Gosh!

17:31.028 --> 17:34.030
♪ Who can make the sun rise?

17:34.064 --> 17:36.399
Why won't anybody tell me?

17:36.433 --> 17:37.400
(crying)

17:37.434 --> 17:39.736
(audience applauds)

17:42.873 --> 17:46.175
(heart beating loudly)

17:51.682 --> 17:52.649
Oh...

17:52.683 --> 17:53.816
I'm sorry.

17:53.851 --> 17:55.018
I was faking it.

17:55.052 --> 17:56.269
(gasps, murmurs)

17:58.956 --> 18:01.190
I lied so I could see Zhenya.

18:01.225 --> 18:03.626
Zhenya. Oh, Zhenya.
Everyone knows Zhenya.

18:03.661 --> 18:05.428
(murmuring)

18:05.462 --> 18:09.032
But there's really only one girl
whose opinion matters to me.

18:09.066 --> 18:10.984
My mom.

18:11.018 --> 18:12.952
I'd like to go home now.

18:12.987 --> 18:16.422
And to think you'd do this
on Mother's Day.

18:16.457 --> 18:18.698
Is it too late to make you
(door shuts) breakfast in bed?

18:20.381 --> 18:22.365
(growling in frustration)

18:23.985 --> 18:25.185
Uh, Mom?

18:25.219 --> 18:27.821
I'm sorry I pretended
to be good at piano.

18:27.855 --> 18:30.023
And I'm really ashamed
that I lied.

18:30.057 --> 18:31.458
(doorbell rings)

18:31.492 --> 18:33.009
Excuse me.

18:34.328 --> 18:37.797
Mrs. Marge, I took
my driver's test.

18:37.832 --> 18:38.865
Did you pass?

18:38.900 --> 18:40.833
More or less.

18:40.852 --> 18:44.521
If I eat an orange wedge,
the whole thing's gonna blow.

18:44.555 --> 18:46.957
Well, I'm glad your side
of the deal worked out.

18:46.991 --> 18:48.124
What are you talking about?

18:48.159 --> 18:49.793
Your boy is genius!

18:49.827 --> 18:51.795
No, he cheated.

18:51.829 --> 18:55.432
Marge, in Russia,
everyone succeeds by cheating.

18:55.466 --> 18:58.301
Even Russian dressing
is just Thousand Island.

18:58.336 --> 18:59.469
(gasps)

18:59.503 --> 19:01.705
But your son is a good boy.

19:01.739 --> 19:05.308
He cheated for love,
and he cheated for you.

19:08.346 --> 19:09.880
Thank you!

19:11.866 --> 19:13.366
All right.

19:13.401 --> 19:15.168
A chance to make a new friend.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.507
Listen, sweetie...

19:20.541 --> 19:23.510
it was wrong of me
to force my dreams on you.

19:23.544 --> 19:26.780
Yeah, your generation won't have
any dreams come true.

19:26.814 --> 19:30.250
Sweetie, you're just
gonna be who you are.

19:30.284 --> 19:31.368
Well, who am I?

19:31.402 --> 19:34.504
You are unique,
you are special,

19:34.538 --> 19:37.040
and at some point,
that's gonna come together

19:37.074 --> 19:38.341
and work for you.

19:38.376 --> 19:40.410
I know it.
Thanks, Mom.

19:40.444 --> 19:42.078
And that means
no punishment, right?

19:42.113 --> 19:43.280
Wrong.

19:43.314 --> 19:45.482
You have to walk
all the way over to Grampa

19:45.516 --> 19:47.517
to take a plate
of cookies I baked.

19:48.886 --> 19:50.854
Here's your
new plate, Grampa.

19:50.888 --> 19:52.055
Oh, boy!

19:52.089 --> 19:53.590
There's crumbs on it!

19:57.295 --> 19:58.261
Marge...

19:58.296 --> 20:00.063
(sighs)

20:00.097 --> 20:01.881
I have something to show you.

20:01.915 --> 20:04.601
Is it your impression
of Mr. Burns eating soup?

20:04.635 --> 20:06.369
Because I'm not in the mood.

20:06.404 --> 20:08.271
No, it's something else.

20:10.441 --> 20:11.608
So?

20:12.944 --> 20:15.578
I've always wondered
what you were hiding

20:15.613 --> 20:17.047
under your curly locks,

20:17.081 --> 20:20.350
my beautiful yellow melon.

20:21.953 --> 20:23.119
Hair, no hair...

20:23.154 --> 20:25.355
I don't really think
about it. (laughs)

20:25.389 --> 20:27.724
Confidence is so
attractive in a man.

20:27.758 --> 20:29.359
Tell me about it.

20:29.393 --> 20:31.995
Oh, Marge, when you
hold me like that...

20:34.849 --> 20:36.416
Thank you, God.
