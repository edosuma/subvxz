WEBVTT

01:15.877 --> 01:17.712
Get the lead out, Billy.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.347
You need to go over to that
sand trap and clean it out.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.317
Looks like a coyote left
you a fuzzy masterpiece.

01:25.620 --> 01:28.155
At least I think
it was a coyote.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.657
You think it was a coyote?

01:31.526 --> 01:33.628
Things are still a little
vague from last night.

01:34.896 --> 01:36.731
Partied with the
college golf team.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.867
I'm Honky Kong bitches!

01:40.868 --> 01:43.437
And I'm princess pee!

01:43.470 --> 01:45.640
You better run, pussies!

01:47.174 --> 01:48.076
Look at 'em go!

01:48.108 --> 01:49.409
Woke up in the sand trap.

01:50.243 --> 01:50.845
Now get to it!

01:50.878 --> 01:51.813
We're burning daylight.

01:53.246 --> 01:54.816
Your wife was asking for you.

01:55.783 --> 01:56.918
Do ya think?

02:08.195 --> 02:09.697
Rally the troops.

02:09.731 --> 02:11.365
T-Rex havoc is a go.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.315
No way.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.853
Are you serious?

02:31.886 --> 02:33.521
Camel Towing?

02:33.554 --> 02:35.355
Hell yeah, Camel Towing.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.390
I'm very serious.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.825
Put your best foot forward, huh?

02:37.859 --> 02:38.760
Good marketing plan.

02:38.793 --> 02:40.795
Come on, a guy with
a sense of humor.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.629
I got a job.

02:41.663 --> 02:43.598
- Ooh!
- Ooh, yeah.

02:43.631 --> 02:44.932
Can I get your number?
I'll give you my number.

02:44.966 --> 02:47.200
I'll give you a free ride
on me,.. right on me.

02:48.468 --> 02:52.239
We believe there's
some excellent

02:52.272 --> 02:54.474
We've done our research.

02:54.509 --> 02:56.410
We're confident
this will connect

02:56.443 --> 02:58.713
with the demographic
you're aiming for.

02:59.881 --> 03:01.248
What do you think, Jim?

03:02.884 --> 03:05.987
Well, I do like
the logo, I do.

03:06.020 --> 03:09.256
But this don't make me
want to buy my hot sauce.

03:09.289 --> 03:10.490
Uh-uh!

03:10.525 --> 03:12.960
This makes me to buy milk.

03:12.994 --> 03:16.363
"One drop is hot enough
for two," really?

03:16.396 --> 03:17.230
Hold on.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.833
Hey, we have some
tamer suggestions.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.968
I mean Ted came up
with a good one.

03:21.002 --> 03:23.905
"Let the fire loose," boom!

03:23.938 --> 03:25.907
Now that is tamer, for sure.

03:25.940 --> 03:28.442
But unfortunately,
Ted, you're an idiot.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.310
That translates in Portuguese

03:30.343 --> 03:32.814
to suffer from burning diarrhea.

03:32.847 --> 03:33.480
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.949
How about "one hot mother?"

03:34.982 --> 03:35.950
No, I told you boys

03:35.983 --> 03:39.419
I wanted to appeal to
the little millennials.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.823
I wanted something
cool and extreme.

03:41.856 --> 03:44.391
Instead, you give
me big ol' titties?

03:44.424 --> 03:47.461
Now, I appreciate all
your efforts, I do.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.463
But unfortunately,
Doug, it's a no.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.599
Come on Jim, just give
us another 24 hours.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.000
We'll get a winner for you.

03:54.334 --> 03:55.803
All right, I like you boys.

03:55.837 --> 03:57.538
I'll give you another day.

03:57.572 --> 04:00.808
But I want something that
says "summertime extreme!"

04:00.842 --> 04:03.978
I want people to
say, "Hot damn!"

04:04.011 --> 04:05.046
- Hot Damn!
- Hot damn!

04:05.079 --> 04:06.013
Hot damn!

04:06.047 --> 04:07.715
- Damn!
- Hey, we're on it.

04:07.749 --> 04:08.716
We're on it.

04:08.750 --> 04:09.917
Thanks a lot.

04:09.951 --> 04:10.618
The extra time means a lot.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.886
You're very welcome, Douglas.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.055
Now, I appreciate it, and I
want you boys to know something.

04:14.088 --> 04:16.289
She do have a nice rack.

04:16.323 --> 04:17.592
All right, I'll give you that.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.660
And I'm gonna take
this thing home with me

04:19.694 --> 04:21.863
if you don't mind.

04:21.896 --> 04:24.532
I'd like to study
her a little deeper,

04:24.565 --> 04:26.834
if you know what I mean.

04:26.868 --> 04:28.936
Did you see what
I did there, Ted?

04:28.970 --> 04:29.771
Did you see that, Chris?

04:29.804 --> 04:30.638
I said "deeper."

04:31.639 --> 04:32.673
Hey, God bless.

04:32.707 --> 04:33.808
God bless you boys.

04:33.841 --> 04:34.842
Likewise.

04:34.876 --> 04:36.043
God bless, Jim.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.479
That guy's a nimrod.

04:39.514 --> 04:41.048
I don't think
this stuff's food.

04:41.082 --> 04:42.550
I'm dying.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.785
He may be a nimrod,

04:43.818 --> 04:45.987
but he's a useful
nimrod right now.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.188
You know if business
wasn't so slow,

04:47.221 --> 04:50.925
I'd tell him to shove his hot
sauce up his hot damn ass!

04:51.859 --> 04:55.328
Hey, thanks again for lending
me your freestyle ski, Mark.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.164
Absolutely, brother.

04:56.197 --> 04:57.565
I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.834
Oh man, you are
so getting fired.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.804
Oh yeah, and I'm
going out with a bang.

05:02.837 --> 05:04.404
All right, you ready?

05:04.437 --> 05:05.405
We're live.

05:05.438 --> 05:06.841
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.510
This is future world champion
jet skier Billy Burnett.

05:09.544 --> 05:12.513
Stay tuned, you are
about to see how I roll.

05:12.547 --> 05:14.048
Pin it to win it, baby!

05:14.081 --> 05:15.082
Woo!

05:26.727 --> 05:27.327
Hello.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.229
This is Douglas Burnett.

05:28.262 --> 05:29.864
Just seeing if you
got my car delivered

05:29.897 --> 05:31.431
to the Refuge okay?

05:31.464 --> 05:33.835
Oh, all good, all
good, Mr. Burnett.

05:33.868 --> 05:36.037
Yeah, yeah, I just dropped her
off right underneath the pool

05:36.070 --> 05:38.973
where all the other cars are
on display just like you asked.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.074
Okay, good.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.008
I just wanted to make sure

05:41.042 --> 05:43.511
my baby didn't get
scratched or anything.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.545
Oh, don't you worry, sir.

05:44.579 --> 05:47.380
You are in the best hands
possible, I promise.

05:47.414 --> 05:48.816
- Thank you.
- Hey, thank you.

05:51.886 --> 05:53.588
Woo, let's do this, guys!

06:06.601 --> 06:08.970
T-Rex is hungry for you, Jerry!

06:09.003 --> 06:10.004
Let's go, baby!

06:12.073 --> 06:14.942
Well, that's something
you don't see everyday.

06:14.976 --> 06:16.010
I gotta check this out.

06:17.078 --> 06:19.847
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Jerry Aldridge,

06:19.881 --> 06:21.816
and this is my wife, Cindy.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.585
Welcome to the Refuge
Golf and Country Club,

06:24.619 --> 06:26.787
Horn Winery charity event.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.055
We're so glad you're here.

06:28.089 --> 06:32.059
Now grab a glass of wine or a
cocktail and enjoy yourselves.

06:32.093 --> 06:34.962
We're going to start the
festivities in just a moment.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.875
Woo, let's go guys!

07:32.119 --> 07:33.621
Big move coming up.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.493
There's a dinosaur jet
skiing in the swimming pool!

07:57.678 --> 07:58.512
Oh, Jerry.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.815
- You're fired!
- Welcome to the party!

08:00.848 --> 08:03.250
Are you a little thirsty?

08:04.952 --> 08:07.487
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.503
Oh no, my dad's car.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.905
He's gonna kill me.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.908
I can't believe it.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.077
I'm gonna kill him!

08:30.111 --> 08:31.979
It's just a car, Douglas.

08:32.013 --> 08:32.913
It can be fixed.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.081
It's not just a car.

08:34.115 --> 08:35.583
It's a collector's item.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.018
I love this car.

08:38.119 --> 08:40.121
I was gonna pass this
car on to Billy someday,

08:40.154 --> 08:41.188
but that's never happening now.

08:41.222 --> 08:42.256
Can you calm down?

08:42.289 --> 08:43.124
No, no, no.

08:43.157 --> 08:44.859
Every week it's
something new with him,

08:44.892 --> 08:46.894
a new video for his
internet followers,

08:46.927 --> 08:47.995
and a new pain in my ass.

08:48.029 --> 08:49.930
That's it, he's out.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.165
We have been over this before.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.733
You are not kicking him out.

08:52.767 --> 08:53.534
He's 21.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.935
When I was 21, you
know what I did?

08:54.969 --> 08:56.070
I didn't have one job.

08:56.103 --> 08:59.740
I had two jobs, and I was
on my own busting my ass.

08:59.774 --> 09:01.575
Maybe if you were around more.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.209
Talk to him.

09:02.243 --> 09:03.277
At least show an interest.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.513
I find that a little difficult

09:04.545 --> 09:07.314
when he's shooting video of
himself in a dinosaur costume

09:07.348 --> 09:09.083
shooting bottle
rockets out his ass!

09:09.116 --> 09:10.985
Show an interest
in his jet skiing.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.686
He has been talking
about wanting to be

09:12.720 --> 09:13.988
a pro jet skier for years.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.189
He's a quitter.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.891
How are you gonna a pro at
anything when you're a quitter?

09:16.924 --> 09:19.193
I mean, as soon as
the going gets tough,

09:19.226 --> 09:20.928
he moves on to his
next adventure.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.930
I don't ask for
much as a father.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.965
Just once, if he could
just see something through,

09:24.999 --> 09:26.801
one thing, focus on that.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.936
Jet skiing is what
he is passionate about.

09:28.969 --> 09:29.837
Oh, oh.

09:29.870 --> 09:30.704
See? See?

09:30.738 --> 09:31.506
Right there, don't
try to defend him.

09:31.540 --> 09:32.339
What kind of
future's jet skiing?

09:32.373 --> 09:34.775
He's just gonna
get a bitchin' tan,

09:34.809 --> 09:36.143
sell some knockoff sunglasses,

09:36.177 --> 09:38.212
and work out of
some beach shack.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.914
And you know I've
never told you this,

09:39.947 --> 09:41.916
you're an enabler and
you're codependent,

09:41.949 --> 09:43.350
- and you know what...
- Okay...

09:43.384 --> 09:45.586
I cannot talk to you
when you're like this.

09:48.022 --> 09:52.660
Great, my car and my wife.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.594
What a joke.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.329
God.

09:57.398 --> 09:59.033
Yes, sir.

09:59.066 --> 09:59.967
I feel you on that.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.370
When she's not happy,
you're not happy, huh?

10:03.404 --> 10:06.040
My damn kid, what
I'm gonna do with him?

10:06.073 --> 10:07.374
I mean, I called in a huge favor

10:07.408 --> 10:10.044
to get him this job that
he just threw it away.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.213
Forgive me for
eavesdropping Mr. Burnett.

10:12.246 --> 10:13.948
I didn't mean to
overhear anything.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.951
But I actually might
have a solution

10:16.984 --> 10:19.353
that could just solve all
your problems in one shot.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.789
- Yeah, right here.
- Oh, no.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.124
Whoa, that's really morbid.

10:23.157 --> 10:25.426
- No, no, I would not.
- Head area, the head area.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.161
Sir, I would not suggest that.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.763
You own an add agency, right?

10:29.797 --> 10:30.831
Yeah.

10:30.865 --> 10:32.800
Okay, so if you can get
just one of your clients

10:32.833 --> 10:33.901
to sponsor a jet ski team,

10:33.934 --> 10:36.837
you look like the most
supportive dad in the world,

10:36.871 --> 10:38.706
you get rid of your kid
for the entire summer,

10:38.739 --> 10:41.008
and, the missus
there might give you

10:41.041 --> 10:43.110
a little bit of that
newlywed nookie,

10:43.144 --> 10:44.879
if you know what I'm saying.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.014
Well, what kind of nimrod

10:47.047 --> 10:49.416
would sponsor a
screw-up like Billy?

10:49.450 --> 10:50.684
Huh, tell me that.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.253
A useful nimrod.

10:52.286 --> 10:53.921
Ah! Hot damn!

10:58.425 --> 10:59.561
Yeah, I don't know Mr. Burnett,

10:59.594 --> 11:01.962
but I was just checking out
Billy's followers earlier,

11:01.996 --> 11:03.797
he's got a couple
hundred thousand, right?

11:03.831 --> 11:06.100
So you mix those numbers
with your sales skills.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.103
Trust me, I know
talent when I see it.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.005
I used to wrench for the
greatest jet skier of all time,

11:11.038 --> 11:12.306
this guy Jarid Harper, right?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.909
He's a five-time world
champion jet skier.

11:14.942 --> 11:18.112
Trust me when I say your
son Billy, he's really good.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.714
This Jarid Harper, is there
any way you can get him,

11:20.748 --> 11:22.850
you know like, to come onboard

11:22.883 --> 11:25.352
as Billy's personal
one-on-one coach?

11:25.386 --> 11:28.122
You know, at least for name
value or appearance sake?

11:28.155 --> 11:29.990
I like where you're going
with this, Mr. Burnett.

11:30.024 --> 11:31.192
Very smart.

11:31.225 --> 11:33.060
Yeah, yeah, Jarid actually
happens to be my best friend.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.395
Traveled the world with him.

11:34.428 --> 11:35.963
We've done lots of
crazy things together.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.164
We're very close.

11:37.198 --> 11:40.801
So I could get the world's
greatest jet skier of all time

11:40.834 --> 11:42.736
to come out of retirement,
coach your son,

11:42.770 --> 11:46.774
who's like the most badass,
extreme new rider on the planet.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.142
Come on, boom!

11:49.944 --> 11:54.215
Hot damn.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.953
Keep this clipped to your
life vest at all times, okay?

11:58.986 --> 12:00.921
If you fall off, it'll
shut the motor off.

12:00.955 --> 12:02.790
Now, this is the slow area.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.091
You gotta go slow here.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.293
And you can go faster
once you reach the buoy.

12:06.327 --> 12:08.028
Oh, okay, go fast to the buoy.

12:08.963 --> 12:10.464
No, no, no, no, no, no, ah...

12:10.497 --> 12:12.900
No wake in this
area, okay, slow.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.937
No waves until you
reach the buoy.

12:16.971 --> 12:20.040
Oh, wave to buoy?

12:20.074 --> 12:22.910
No, no, no okay,
in this area...

12:22.943 --> 12:24.011
Do you need some help?

12:24.044 --> 12:25.045
Oh, yes, please.

12:25.079 --> 12:26.046
Thank you.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.815
- Konichiwa.
- Oh, konichiwa...

12:31.051 --> 12:32.086
What's up, man?

12:32.119 --> 12:33.887
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.089
- How you doing?
- Doing good.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.358
You got yourself a
new employee there?

12:37.391 --> 12:38.292
Yes, I do.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.927
And, no, you can't.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.128
Oh, come on.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.063
So, what brings you

12:43.097 --> 12:44.999
all the way out
here to Havasu, Dog?

12:45.032 --> 12:47.067
Oh, just your old
wrench bringing you

12:47.101 --> 12:50.004
the best opportunity
you've had in years.

12:50.037 --> 12:50.938
Well, you know,
nothing's changed.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.973
"I'm retired," I
know, I know, I know.

12:53.007 --> 12:54.441
Look, I'm not talking
about you racing.

12:54.475 --> 12:57.011
No, I'm talking about
you coaching a new kid.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.979
I mean, that is, unless
you'd rather stay here

12:59.013 --> 13:01.949
and teach tourists how to
ride through the no wake zone?

13:03.851 --> 13:06.220
Hey, hey, plus, plus, I got
us a full sponsorship deal

13:06.253 --> 13:09.056
from our friends at
Grim Ripper Hot Sauce!

13:09.089 --> 13:11.058
Huh, what does that do for ya?

13:11.091 --> 13:13.060
A new kid with a
full sponsorship?

13:13.093 --> 13:14.061
Is he really that good?

13:14.094 --> 13:15.996
Oh yeah, he reminds
me of you at his age.

13:16.030 --> 13:18.032
He's fast and fearless.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.601
With a little guidance from you,

13:19.634 --> 13:21.335
he could be the
next Jarid Harper.

13:22.570 --> 13:24.938
Look, I can't leave my
business for the whole summer.

13:24.972 --> 13:25.873
Your business?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.074
Come on, your business
is gonna be fine.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.343
Your employees can handle
things for a couple of months.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.845
Plus, you're gonna come
back with so much cash,

13:31.879 --> 13:33.981
you can buy yourself some
new skis, and you need 'em.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.115
Come on.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.485
There's always
a catch with you.

13:38.520 --> 13:39.920
So come on, what is it?

13:39.953 --> 13:40.921
Huh, what, what catch?

13:40.954 --> 13:41.756
There's no catch.

13:41.790 --> 13:43.123
Come on, we're
going on tour again!

13:43.157 --> 13:44.458
That's it, up high!

13:46.026 --> 13:48.530
Sounds grand, but... pass.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.368
All right, well hey, you
know if you don't do this,...

13:55.302 --> 13:57.539
Richard is gonna tie
your record this year.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.642
Are you telling me
nobody's put that jackass

14:00.675 --> 14:02.976
in his place yet?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.512
You know what, never mind.

14:04.546 --> 14:05.547
I'm over it.

14:05.580 --> 14:07.081
- You're over it?
- Yep.

14:07.114 --> 14:07.915
You're over it?

14:07.948 --> 14:08.882
Come on, man, it's me.

14:08.916 --> 14:09.950
Who are you kidding?

14:09.983 --> 14:11.385
That douche bag
ended your career.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.053
You have every
right to hate him.

14:13.087 --> 14:16.090
Now I know, I know,
you went backpacking

14:16.123 --> 14:17.559
through Europe with
a bunch of monks,

14:17.592 --> 14:19.561
you got all zenned out
and you came back saying,

14:19.594 --> 14:21.228
you know, "Things
happen for a reason,"

14:21.261 --> 14:22.630
and "The universe
will make it right."

14:22.664 --> 14:23.565
No, come on!

14:23.598 --> 14:24.465
You know what I say?

14:24.498 --> 14:27.267
I say we open up a
can of whoop-ass on

14:27.301 --> 14:31.105
Champ, you need this
just as bad as I do.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.574
I do not need this.

14:32.607 --> 14:33.941
- You do not need this?
- No.

14:33.974 --> 14:34.743
Come on, I see it.

14:34.776 --> 14:36.310
You're carrying
around this grudge

14:36.343 --> 14:38.479
that's just gonna haunt
you the rest of your life.

14:40.414 --> 14:41.649
Okay, think about it.

14:41.683 --> 14:45.018
How long was it that your last
girlfriend stuck around, huh?

14:45.052 --> 14:47.121
Well, a lot longer than any
girlfriend you've ever had.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.523
Well yeah,
I mean, it's me.

14:48.556 --> 14:50.023
You know, two lap
dances in a row

14:50.057 --> 14:51.225
is a long term
relationship, right?

14:51.258 --> 14:52.259
Huh? Come on!

14:52.292 --> 14:53.260
Come on!

14:53.293 --> 14:56.063
Oh my God, you're
leaving me hanging again?

14:56.096 --> 14:58.165
Champ, think about it this way.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.233
If you do this,

14:59.266 --> 15:01.235
you're gonna keep Richard
from tying your record,

15:01.268 --> 15:04.572
and you're giving something
else back to the sport,

15:04.606 --> 15:06.073
a new champion.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.375
It'll be like old
times, you and me,

15:08.409 --> 15:10.344
racin' and chasin'.

15:11.245 --> 15:16.049
Come on, come on, one
last ride, please.

15:16.083 --> 15:16.917
Come on.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.022
Yeah!

15:22.055 --> 15:23.023
Yeah?

15:23.056 --> 15:24.124
Are we doing this?

15:24.158 --> 15:25.325
Are we going on tour?

15:25.359 --> 15:27.094
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

15:27.127 --> 15:28.429
Well, sound excited
about it, come on.

15:28.462 --> 15:30.964
- Yay!
- Yeah! Tour!

15:30.998 --> 15:31.699
Come on, now.

16:09.403 --> 16:12.774
Well, he's a
half an hour late.

16:12.807 --> 16:14.542
I know, I know, I
know, you hate that.

16:14.576 --> 16:16.744
But look, he drove in super
late last night, okay?

16:16.778 --> 16:17.645
He's a young guy.

16:17.679 --> 16:18.445
He needs his sleep.

16:18.479 --> 16:20.481
Just go easy on
him, okay? Please?

16:22.049 --> 16:24.151
Yeah, all right fine,
I'll go easy on him.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.988
Woo-hoo!

16:31.458 --> 16:32.794
Woo!

16:32.827 --> 16:34.094
Here we are,

16:34.127 --> 16:36.764
Body Beach in Lake
Havasu, Arizona.

16:36.798 --> 16:39.634
Now, this is where
champions are made.

16:39.667 --> 16:40.802
Be nice, be chill.

16:40.835 --> 16:42.804
He's excited, all right?

16:42.837 --> 16:46.073
Speaking of champions,
check this guy out.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.343
The man, the myth, the legend,

16:49.376 --> 16:51.746
Jarid Harper, ladies
and gentlemen!

16:54.248 --> 16:55.650
You're late.

16:55.683 --> 17:00.187
Yeah, yeah, I had a little
video snafu this morning.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.589
Video snafu?

17:01.623 --> 17:04.424
Yeah, yeah, we're
streaming live.

17:04.458 --> 17:07.261
Oh yeah, that's a thing
nowadays, streaming live.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.630
Oh, great, great.

17:08.663 --> 17:10.197
Well, here's my thing.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.099
On time next time.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.400
Now go get your damn gear on.

17:14.802 --> 17:16.169
Nice to meet you too.

17:19.807 --> 17:20.642
What are you doing?

17:20.675 --> 17:21.843
You said, "Okay,
I'll be nice to him."

17:21.876 --> 17:23.645
Yeah, well, I lied.

17:23.678 --> 17:24.444
- All right!
- Woo!

17:24.478 --> 17:27.147
Time to stick it
in and get it wet!

17:27.180 --> 17:28.783
Pin it
to win it, baby!

17:28.816 --> 17:29.784
Do it, baby.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.792
Damn it!

17:37.825 --> 17:38.826
Oh, you gotta love him.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.863
He's just like you were, huh?

17:41.896 --> 17:43.665
You kidding me? I
was never that cocky.

17:43.698 --> 17:44.799
Oh, come on.

17:44.832 --> 17:45.867
Hey, who was that guy

17:45.900 --> 17:47.569
that used to show up to
all those rider's meetings

17:47.602 --> 17:49.336
saying, "Hey, " which
one of you guys

17:49.369 --> 17:50.237
"is getting second place?"

17:50.270 --> 17:51.405
Huh, who was that?

17:52.540 --> 17:55.342
Yeah, well, I was
right, wasn't I?

18:11.158 --> 18:13.895
Woo!

18:13.928 --> 18:15.597
What do you think, huh?

18:15.630 --> 18:18.298
Well he knows how to
squeeze the throttle.

18:18.332 --> 18:20.535
How's he gonna be in
a crowd, any finesse?

18:20.568 --> 18:22.202
Finesse? Come on,
please, look at this guy.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.538
He's like a Picasso out there.

18:27.341 --> 18:29.777
Oh yeah, a Picasso all right,

18:29.811 --> 18:31.311
one eye and three tits.

18:34.616 --> 18:36.517
Yeah!

18:38.786 --> 18:39.821
That thing is a rocket.

18:40.955 --> 18:42.456
I'm having trouble
with the turns.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.559
Yeah, welcome to
the GP ski class.

18:44.592 --> 18:46.561
This thing right here
is like 1,100 cc's

18:46.594 --> 18:48.763
of raw, butt-clinching
horsepower.

18:48.796 --> 18:50.898
You need to scuff up the
bottom and get some bite.

18:50.932 --> 18:53.467
Run it up on the
beach a couple times.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.536
Purposely scratch a new hull?

18:55.570 --> 18:56.671
It's an old speed secret.

18:56.704 --> 18:59.406
Oh, and another thing, set
up for the turns earlier.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.241
Sometimes you gotta
go slower to go fast.

19:02.409 --> 19:03.611
Excuse me, gentlemen.

19:04.512 --> 19:06.213
Mr. Burnett, hello.

19:06.848 --> 19:08.415
Oh, yeah, yeah,
Billy's doing great.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.817
Yeah, I was actually
just telling Jarid

19:09.851 --> 19:10.685
he's riding around out there

19:10.718 --> 19:12.754
with like the
finesse of a Picasso.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.189
Oh, that's a bummer.

19:17.558 --> 19:20.193
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, um...

19:20.227 --> 19:20.862
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:20.895 --> 19:22.730
I will tell them.

19:22.764 --> 19:24.899
All right, you too. Take care.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.368
Well, that was your Dad.

19:28.402 --> 19:29.971
He said something
came up at the office,

19:30.004 --> 19:32.540
but he wanted us to take a bunch
of pictures of the program,

19:32.573 --> 19:35.308
and he's really interested
in seeing those.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.612
He wanted to make sure we
sent them off to him...

20:01.002 --> 20:02.970
Interesting how
Billy's dad hooks him up

20:03.004 --> 20:04.505
with a full sponsorship,

20:04.539 --> 20:07.340
and then just doesn't
show up today.

20:08.643 --> 20:10.678
I mean, yeah, he's
a busy guy, you know.

20:10.712 --> 20:12.479
He runs an add agency.

20:12.513 --> 20:13.280
We're the pros.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.016
He trusts us to
keep him updated.

20:15.049 --> 20:16.818
So that must be
why he called you

20:16.851 --> 20:19.554
to say he couldn't come,
and not his own son?

20:19.587 --> 20:20.855
Yeah, yeah, exactly, right.

20:22.957 --> 20:25.459
And then Billy rams the
ski up onto the beach,

20:25.492 --> 20:28.830
barely apologizes,
and then just bolts.

20:29.864 --> 20:30.865
Well, I mean, you know,

20:30.898 --> 20:32.533
that's probably just
because he was embarrassed

20:32.567 --> 20:34.001
about screwing up in
front of his hero.

20:34.035 --> 20:36.804
You know, "the"
Jarid Harper, huh?

20:36.838 --> 20:41.341
Yeah, yeah, that must
be what it is, yeah.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.476
Time to come clean, Dog!

20:42.510 --> 20:43.678
- Ah! Come on, come on!
- There's always a catch with

20:43.711 --> 20:45.412
- with you. Now, what is it?
- There's no catch, no catch!

20:45.445 --> 20:46.047
There's no catch, get off!

20:46.080 --> 20:47.548
Get off, get off, get off!

20:51.018 --> 20:52.854
I think you bruised
my manaconda.

20:52.887 --> 20:55.923
Well, maybe if you're lucky,
it'll swell up to adult size.

20:56.758 --> 20:57.725
- Now talk.
- All right, all right,

20:57.759 --> 20:59.459
all right, all right,
all right, all right.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.929
Look, the deal is,...

21:03.698 --> 21:06.701
Billy's a pain in
his dad's ass, all right?

21:06.734 --> 21:07.902
So his dad got him a sponsor

21:07.935 --> 21:09.070
to get rid of him on
tour for the summer.

21:09.103 --> 21:10.437
That's it, that's
what's going on.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.840
What are we, a
couple of babysitters?

21:12.874 --> 21:13.941
No.

21:13.975 --> 21:15.076
You know what, this
whole thing is a sham, Dog.

21:15.109 --> 21:16.343
What were you thinking, huh?

21:17.812 --> 21:18.613
- No.
- I'm out.

21:18.646 --> 21:19.479
Come on, champ, no.

21:19.514 --> 21:21.516
You can't quit.

21:21.549 --> 21:22.750
I'm out.

21:22.784 --> 21:24.986
Come on, come on, Champ.

21:25.019 --> 21:25.820
Forget it.

21:25.853 --> 21:26.654
No, come on.

21:26.687 --> 21:27.889
You can't leave.
You saw his face.

21:27.922 --> 21:29.356
If you leave, he's got nothing.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.026
Fine, but you owe me.

21:33.895 --> 21:34.996
Welcome to round one

21:35.029 --> 21:37.364
of the Azeo Distilleries Tour.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.966
There's added excitement
in the air today

21:39.000 --> 21:40.935
thanks to the return of
the greatest champion

21:40.968 --> 21:43.571
of all time, Jarid Harper.

21:43.604 --> 21:44.705
What'd I tell you?

21:44.739 --> 21:47.041
Just like old times, yeah champ?

21:47.074 --> 21:49.610
Love the smell of race
fuel in the morning.

21:49.644 --> 21:50.711
Smells like victory.

22:07.128 --> 22:09.530
Yeah, just like old times.

22:13.668 --> 22:14.502
Jarid!

22:15.603 --> 22:18.139
My goodness, you're
still on tour?

22:18.172 --> 22:19.907
But of course.

22:19.941 --> 22:20.908
Hide the women.

22:20.942 --> 22:22.442
It's too late.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.410
Hey, hey, Billy!

22:23.443 --> 22:26.080
Billy, I want you to
meet Jean Paul Nukette,

22:26.113 --> 22:27.849
also known as Nuke.

22:27.882 --> 22:30.383
Also known as tet-a-peen.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.019
That's French for dickhead.

22:34.789 --> 22:36.389
Tell me, are you
still a virgin?

22:36.423 --> 22:38.559
You guys starting already?

22:38.593 --> 22:40.094
You know, Nuke's a freestyler.

22:40.127 --> 22:41.596
So basically he just competes

22:41.629 --> 22:43.463
for a whopping two
minutes every weekend,

22:43.496 --> 22:45.867
and then he talks to girls
with his fancy French accent

22:45.900 --> 22:47.134
and they all melt.

22:47.168 --> 22:49.136
This is a typical
weekend for Dog.

22:49.170 --> 22:52.940
He just waxes on and
then he whacks off.

22:55.142 --> 22:57.477
So Billy, you're so fast

22:57.511 --> 22:58.980
they had to give you
three number ones?

22:59.013 --> 22:59.947
Yeah, I'll be
peeling two of 'em off

22:59.981 --> 23:01.414
by the end of the season.

23:02.116 --> 23:04.652
- I like your attitude.
- Yeah.

23:04.685 --> 23:06.453
I heard there was a
loose dog running around

23:06.486 --> 23:07.054
in these pits.

23:07.088 --> 23:08.556
Aw, you know it, baby!

23:08.589 --> 23:09.957
Come here, give the dog a bone.

23:11.058 --> 23:11.893
Good to see you.

23:12.927 --> 23:14.862
- Hi, champ.
- Hey.

23:14.896 --> 23:16.597
Oh, it's
been too long.

23:16.631 --> 23:17.832
Look at you.

23:17.865 --> 23:19.867
Little Kelly Weber
grows up to be beautiful

23:19.901 --> 23:22.837
and Hot Water Champion
from what I hear.

23:23.771 --> 23:26.908
- Very nice.
- Ah, Kelly, my dream woman.

23:27.975 --> 23:30.077
Save it Nuke.

23:30.111 --> 23:32.880
Hey, Kelly Weber, I'm Billy.

23:32.914 --> 23:34.949
I've seen you in
all the magazines.

23:34.982 --> 23:36.884
Ah, you must be
Jarid's new protege

23:36.918 --> 23:38.119
everyone's buzzing about.

23:38.152 --> 23:40.655
I am, and it is all true.

23:40.688 --> 23:42.189
There you are.

23:42.223 --> 23:44.457
Oh, guys, this is Summer.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.027
She rides for Team Scream.

23:46.060 --> 23:47.995
Hi, I'm Dog.

23:48.029 --> 23:50.998
Now you know what to team
scream later tonight.

23:51.032 --> 23:52.967
You should save your
breath for your blow-up doll.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.902
I'm sure you'll need it.

23:58.005 --> 23:59.607
Hello, my name is Nuke.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.142
Oh, please keep
your lips off me.

24:01.175 --> 24:02.910
There's no telling
where they've been.

24:02.944 --> 24:04.946
Oh hey, team boobies.

24:04.979 --> 24:06.781
I like her.

24:06.814 --> 24:08.516
I'm sure you recognize Jarid.

24:08.549 --> 24:09.917
Of course, the legend.

24:09.951 --> 24:11.519
Hmm, nice to meet you.

24:11.552 --> 24:13.120
And his new rider, Billy.

24:13.154 --> 24:14.388
Hi.

24:14.422 --> 24:16.557
You must be pretty special
to be teamed up with this guy.

24:16.590 --> 24:18.025
Yes, I am.

24:18.059 --> 24:20.261
Okay, and modest too.

24:20.294 --> 24:21.128
Yeah.

24:22.530 --> 24:24.131
Jarid Harper!

24:26.901 --> 24:28.235
How's the ah,.. how's the leg?

24:30.204 --> 24:31.272
Oh, whoops!

24:31.305 --> 24:32.974
Sorry about that, Richard.

24:33.007 --> 24:34.208
Don't worry, I'm
sure it'll come off

24:34.241 --> 24:36.610
next time you shed your skin.

24:36.644 --> 24:37.878
It's all good, big dog.

24:39.647 --> 24:40.982
You and Jarid
go way back, huh?

24:41.949 --> 24:43.918
Yeah, ever since
I was a little girl.

24:43.951 --> 24:46.287
Him and my dad used to be
friends back in the day.

24:46.320 --> 24:50.057
Kelly, team meeting,... Now.

24:51.125 --> 24:52.093
Whoa.

24:52.126 --> 24:54.962
Hey Richard, might want
to lay off the donuts.

24:54.996 --> 24:56.731
Gettin' a little muffin
top going on there.

24:56.764 --> 24:57.999
Gotta compete in a
different weight class.

24:58.032 --> 24:59.033
Oh yeah, real nice.

25:00.267 --> 25:02.970
Well, that was a nice visit.

25:04.038 --> 25:06.841
So you're racing on
Richard's team now, huh?

25:06.874 --> 25:08.676
I tried to contact
you for some advice

25:08.709 --> 25:11.846
when I got the offer, but no
one could seem to find you.

25:11.879 --> 25:14.682
Yeah, I was on a bit
of an extended vacation.

25:14.715 --> 25:16.751
Does he always boss
you around like that?

25:16.784 --> 25:18.085
Ever since she
went out with him.

25:18.919 --> 25:20.988
You dated that guy?

25:22.056 --> 25:24.759
Well, you know, we
were training together,

25:24.792 --> 25:25.926
and went to dinners, and then...

25:25.960 --> 25:28.029
- Uh-huh
- I know, I know.

25:28.062 --> 25:29.096
yeah.

25:29.130 --> 25:30.998
Thank you Summer for sharing.

25:31.032 --> 25:33.300
Maybe it's just that
bad boy thing we're into.

25:33.334 --> 25:34.802
- I don't know.
- Wow.

25:34.835 --> 25:36.337
You wanna see my tattoo?

25:36.370 --> 25:37.805
- I have a tattoo here.
- No.

25:37.838 --> 25:39.040
Wait, you want
me to follow you?

25:39.073 --> 25:40.307
Ah...

25:40.341 --> 25:41.175
Settle down.

25:42.209 --> 25:43.577
Guys, I've gotta go.

25:43.611 --> 25:44.912
It was great to see you.

25:44.945 --> 25:46.180
Good luck.

25:49.984 --> 25:52.086
The GP ski
pro class is on the line.

25:52.119 --> 25:53.788
All the top names are here,

25:53.821 --> 25:56.991
and a new rider everyone is
excited to see, Billy Burnett.

25:57.024 --> 25:59.160
Expectations are running
high for this young man.

25:59.193 --> 26:02.196
It'll be interesting
to see what he can do.

26:02.229 --> 26:03.931
All right, it's
first race of the year,

26:03.964 --> 26:05.666
so everyone's gonna be
charging into that first turn

26:05.699 --> 26:06.634
way over their heads.

26:06.667 --> 26:09.703
Stay inside. Ride smart.

26:10.871 --> 26:11.872
Time to show 'em your ass.

26:30.825 --> 26:31.826
Settle down, Billy.

26:31.859 --> 26:33.160
Ride smooth.

26:33.194 --> 26:35.029
Newcomer
Billy Burnett is struggling

26:35.062 --> 26:38.032
in the chop, having trouble
negotiating the turns.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.102
Come on, Billy!
Choose your lines.

26:47.708 --> 26:49.176
Burnett's
riding has been erratic,

26:49.210 --> 26:50.878
but his speed is unquestionable.

26:50.911 --> 26:52.413
He's reeling in Richard Hurt,

26:52.446 --> 26:54.915
and is beginning to put
pressure on our leader.

27:01.255 --> 27:03.757
Burnett is closing the gap,
but it looks like Richard Hurt

27:03.791 --> 27:06.026
is just playing with
him at this point.

27:06.060 --> 27:07.128
Stop screwing around.

27:07.161 --> 27:08.395
Burnett's coming
up on you quick.

27:11.932 --> 27:13.767
Richard, he's right
behind you. Come on.

27:13.801 --> 27:15.202
I'm setting him up.

27:15.236 --> 27:16.971
Back off, Billy,
he's setting you up!

27:18.405 --> 27:20.141
Look out,
they're rubbing skis!

27:20.174 --> 27:21.442
Whoa-ho!

27:21.475 --> 27:22.910
And apparently Richard Hurt

27:22.943 --> 27:26.280
is giving Billy his
welcome to the pro class.

27:26.313 --> 27:27.882
Burnett has a few
things to learn,

27:27.915 --> 27:30.317
and Richard Hurt just
gave him his first lesson.

27:32.419 --> 27:34.288
Welcome to Sacramento
for round two

27:34.321 --> 27:36.757
of the Azeo Distilleries Tour.

27:36.790 --> 27:38.425
Once again, it's Kelly Weber

27:38.459 --> 27:40.361
dominating the pro women's class

27:40.394 --> 27:43.030
aboard her Broward
Motorsports Kawasaki,

27:43.063 --> 27:45.799
lapping near the entire
field in the process.

27:45.833 --> 27:47.101
As she crosses the finish line,

27:47.134 --> 27:49.036
she leaves no doubt
in anybody's mind

27:49.069 --> 27:51.939
that she is literally
in a class of her own.

27:54.775 --> 27:56.177
You should take
it easy out there.

27:56.210 --> 27:57.444
You keep lapping all
the girls like that,

27:57.478 --> 27:59.346
they won't want to
race with you anymore.

27:59.380 --> 28:00.214
That's okay.

28:00.247 --> 28:01.982
I want to race against
the men anyway.

28:02.016 --> 28:03.417
Oh, I'm scared.

28:03.450 --> 28:05.052
You should be,

28:05.085 --> 28:06.921
especially after the way
you rode last weekend.

28:07.755 --> 28:09.757
Okay, that's very nice.

28:11.358 --> 28:13.194
He is such a jerk.

28:13.227 --> 28:14.995
He parades different girls
around me like I care,

28:15.029 --> 28:17.264
and now he's giving me dirty
looks for talking to you.

28:17.298 --> 28:19.300
What ever happened
with him and Jarid?

28:19.333 --> 28:21.468
I heard that he
couldn't beat him,

28:21.503 --> 28:24.805
and so he slammed into
his ski and broke his leg.

28:24.838 --> 28:27.509
Yeah, and it happened on
the back side of the wave.

28:27.542 --> 28:29.043
Richard claims it
was an accident,

28:29.076 --> 28:32.346
and since nobody saw it,
that's how it was ruled.

28:33.247 --> 28:36.518
I guess Jarid's right, he
does give assholes a bad name.

28:39.220 --> 28:40.120
Think I'm going
to have a little fun

28:40.154 --> 28:41.055
with Burnett on the line.

28:41.088 --> 28:43.157
See if I can get him
to jump the start.

28:43.190 --> 28:43.991
Focus on winning.

28:44.024 --> 28:45.059
Do what you do best.

28:45.092 --> 28:46.393
Go out there and ride
the way you ride and win.

28:46.427 --> 28:47.895
Don't worry about that stuff.

28:51.065 --> 28:51.865
The
rivalry developing

28:51.899 --> 28:53.901
between Hurt and
Burnett is obvious,

28:53.934 --> 28:56.070
as neither rider
wants to give an inch.

28:56.103 --> 28:57.338
Hurt jumps! Uh-oh!

28:57.371 --> 28:59.473
Burnett reacts and
completely jumps the start,

28:59.507 --> 29:01.141
catching the rubber
band under his neck.

29:01.175 --> 29:05.212
It pulls him off his ski in a
painful lesson of restraint.

29:05.246 --> 29:08.115
And Burnett takes the ride
of shame back to the line.

29:08.148 --> 29:10.050
The official signals
he will now have

29:10.084 --> 29:11.952
a dead engine on the restart.

29:14.054 --> 29:15.523
Burnett will start in
the back of the pack,

29:15.557 --> 29:16.924
and have to deal with the chop

29:16.957 --> 29:18.959
from the rest of the
riders in front of him.

29:20.127 --> 29:21.929
It's a washing
machine out there.

29:21.962 --> 29:24.164
In conditions like this, you
have to find your rhythm,

29:24.198 --> 29:26.467
and Burnett just can't
seem to find his.

29:30.037 --> 29:31.438
Burnett steps off again!

29:31.472 --> 29:33.974
He has to be getting
frustrated at this point.

29:35.909 --> 29:37.978
Burnett attacking
the log jump section,

29:38.012 --> 29:38.979
blowing by two riders.

29:39.013 --> 29:42.182
Oh! He miss-times it,
and goes over the bars!

29:44.385 --> 29:45.986
Burnett is showing promise,

29:46.020 --> 29:49.290
but his go for broke riding
style has cost him again.

29:54.261 --> 29:56.230
It's a beautiful day
here in Huntington Beach

29:56.263 --> 29:59.233
for round three of the
Azeo Distilleries Tour.

30:05.239 --> 30:06.273
Come on, Billy stay low.

30:06.307 --> 30:08.208
If you're in the air,
you're not going forward.

30:24.091 --> 30:26.060
Cut now! Cut now!
Get over the wave!

30:34.569 --> 30:36.203
Burnett and
Hurt are side by side.

30:36.236 --> 30:39.206
Burnett goes big, but Hurt
stays low and pulls away!

30:43.043 --> 30:45.012
Burnett and Hurt are
battling through the surf.

30:46.347 --> 30:47.549
Cut, Billy, cut!

30:47.582 --> 30:49.049
Hurt
stays tight in the turn

30:49.083 --> 30:50.050
and gets over the wave.

30:50.084 --> 30:53.187
Burnett goes wide and
the wave takes him out!

31:07.034 --> 31:08.969
They're off the line
here in Myrtle Beach.

31:10.404 --> 31:12.439
Billy Burnett
catching some big air,

31:12.473 --> 31:14.975
but losing time as Richard
Hurt moves to the front.

31:15.008 --> 31:16.410
Check out the
drive from Burnett,

31:16.443 --> 31:19.647
as he's found some traction
and he blows by Hurt.

31:21.148 --> 31:23.217
Burnett leads the pack into
the first turn, and yes,

31:23.250 --> 31:26.253
it is Billy Burnett with
the holeshot, unbelievable!

31:26.286 --> 31:27.287
Burnett out in front.

31:27.321 --> 31:27.955
But what's this?

31:27.988 --> 31:29.990
He went to the wrong buoy.

31:30.023 --> 31:31.191
Burnett drops two positions.

31:31.225 --> 31:33.093
Where is his head today?

31:35.429 --> 31:37.364
Burnett charging
through the surf.

31:37.398 --> 31:39.466
He flies off a wave
and goes by Motzurus,

31:39.500 --> 31:40.668
moving into second place.

31:40.702 --> 31:41.969
He misses the buoy.

31:42.002 --> 31:43.470
He'll have to circle back!

31:43.505 --> 31:45.640
But he keeps going!

31:45.673 --> 31:47.509
Billy, are you kidding me?

31:47.542 --> 31:48.976
Konichiwa, joudan de shou.

31:50.177 --> 31:51.111
Japanese?

31:51.145 --> 31:52.079
It's worth a shot.

31:52.112 --> 31:53.380
He sure as hell doesn't
understand English.

32:05.092 --> 32:06.026
Don't freewind your
engine like that.

32:06.059 --> 32:07.060
You're gonna blow it up.

32:22.476 --> 32:23.578
Billy
Burnett has been riding

32:23.611 --> 32:24.646
like Charlie Manson.

32:24.679 --> 32:25.580
He has caught Richard Hurt,

32:25.613 --> 32:27.414
and they are battling
through the chop,

32:27.448 --> 32:28.982
heading out to the far buoy.

32:30.083 --> 32:31.686
Hurt on the inside,
Burnett on the outside.

32:31.719 --> 32:33.655
Burnett stays wide
and he gets by Hurt

32:33.688 --> 32:34.756
to take over the lead.

32:36.190 --> 32:38.660
Billy, you can't keep
it pinned like that!

32:43.330 --> 32:45.165
Holy Toledo!

32:45.199 --> 32:46.400
Burnett has a comfortable lead,

32:46.433 --> 32:49.169
but he's still
riding like a madman.

32:49.203 --> 32:51.271
Somebody
better check with NASA.

32:51.305 --> 32:52.973
This could be a moon shot!

32:54.609 --> 32:57.010
Billy Burnett experiencing
mechanical problems,

32:57.044 --> 32:58.245
getting towed in.

32:58.278 --> 33:01.482
No surprise there after he's
been freewinding all day long.

33:01.516 --> 33:04.218
This is not the way you
want to end your weekend.

33:06.688 --> 33:11.058
Yeah, it was disappointing
to say the least.

33:11.091 --> 33:12.426
The guys, they're
kind of pissed.

33:12.459 --> 33:14.027
They're gonna make me
help tear the motor apart

33:14.061 --> 33:15.429
so I can learn how it works.

33:18.232 --> 33:19.634
Oh, I almost forgot.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.435
Happy birthday, Mom.

33:21.468 --> 33:23.237
Did you get the flowers
that I sent you?

33:25.339 --> 33:27.407
The flowers are
beautiful, Billy.

33:27.441 --> 33:28.676
Thank you so much.

33:28.710 --> 33:29.343
Oh, your dad's here.

33:29.376 --> 33:30.410
Do you want to talk to him?

33:31.713 --> 33:32.747
I'm on a business
call, I can't.

33:32.780 --> 33:34.448
Fill me in later.

33:34.481 --> 33:35.349
I'm sorry, honey.

33:35.382 --> 33:37.217
He's on a business call.

33:37.251 --> 33:40.522
Okay, talk to you soon, bye.

33:43.123 --> 33:45.092
You two should hook up.

33:45.125 --> 33:47.494
Nope, I'm not dating
another racer again.

33:47.529 --> 33:48.696
I didn't say date.

33:48.730 --> 33:50.264
I said hook up.

33:51.298 --> 33:52.767
You know me better than that.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.401
Okay, then date him.

33:54.434 --> 33:55.837
Look, you know he likes you

33:55.870 --> 33:58.673
and he's not like
these other animals.

33:58.706 --> 33:59.707
He's a good guy.

34:00.875 --> 34:04.144
A good guy maybe,
but not a good idea.

34:04.846 --> 34:07.615
Look, if you don't
date him, then I will.

34:07.649 --> 34:09.349
And by the time
I'm done with him,

34:09.383 --> 34:11.786
he'll need years of therapy.

34:11.819 --> 34:13.120
Excuse me gentlemen,

34:14.187 --> 34:14.856
would you like to
purchase a delicacy

34:14.889 --> 34:16.524
to help support our orphanage?

34:17.491 --> 34:18.292
Sure, yeah.

34:18.325 --> 34:19.661
- How much?
- $20.

34:20.562 --> 34:21.563
$20?

34:21.596 --> 34:22.530
$20.

34:22.564 --> 34:23.731
What are you buying?

34:23.765 --> 34:26.768
I don't know, but
it's for an orphanage.

34:26.801 --> 34:28.135
It's called squeella.

34:28.168 --> 34:30.203
It's pureed squid,
eel, and fish.

34:30.237 --> 34:32.472
It smells bad, but
it tastes delicious.

34:32.507 --> 34:34.408
Um, you said 20?

34:34.441 --> 34:35.409
Yeah.

34:35.442 --> 34:36.410
What if I...

34:36.443 --> 34:38.211
Just give me that, and
I'll give you all this.

34:38.245 --> 34:39.714
Just give me the whole
cooler, everything, okay?

34:39.747 --> 34:41.381
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, yeah.

34:41.415 --> 34:42.316
- Thank you very much.
- Mm-hmm.

34:42.349 --> 34:43.450
- Oh, you're very welcome.
- God bless you!

34:43.483 --> 34:44.519
Oh, God bless you.

34:44.552 --> 34:45.520
Well, it's for an orphanage.

34:45.553 --> 34:47.287
So, you know, beneath
this bad dog exterior,

34:47.321 --> 34:49.657
I got a really big
soft spot for the kids.

34:49.691 --> 34:51.491
Oh, hi girls.

34:52.459 --> 34:53.861
How are you?

34:53.895 --> 34:56.598
Oh! What is that?

34:57.497 --> 34:59.132
Don't look at me.

34:59.934 --> 35:01.703
Dog bought it.

35:01.736 --> 35:02.503
I don't know, it's
for an orphanage.

35:02.537 --> 35:03.538
What are you going
to do, just...

35:06.306 --> 35:08.275
Hey, what are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

35:08.308 --> 35:08.910
You want to join us?

35:08.943 --> 35:10.110
You know, Jarid's buying.

35:11.178 --> 35:12.279
I can't, guys.

35:12.312 --> 35:14.147
I'm getting heat
from my camp already.

35:14.181 --> 35:16.784
Old Dog can take
care of your teammate.

35:16.818 --> 35:17.719
What do you say?

35:17.752 --> 35:20.153
What can I say,
problem solved, right?

35:20.187 --> 35:20.788
Right.

35:20.822 --> 35:22.624
All right, let's do this.

35:22.657 --> 35:26.326
Miss Summer, after you.

35:26.360 --> 35:28.195
Playing hard to get, I like it.

35:30.464 --> 35:32.567
Ah, come on now.
That's the last one.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.401
Go big or go home.

35:34.434 --> 35:36.436
20 bucks says you
can't do two drops.

35:36.470 --> 35:38.338
Come on, two drops?

35:38.372 --> 35:39.741
How about I do three drops

35:39.774 --> 35:41.208
and loser has to
buy drinks tonight?

35:42.376 --> 35:43.878
That's what I'm talking
about. Let's see it.

35:43.911 --> 35:45.412
- Deal?
- Yeah, deal.

35:45.445 --> 35:46.948
All right, ready for this?

35:46.981 --> 35:47.849
Check this out.

35:47.882 --> 35:50.752
One, two, three.

35:59.861 --> 36:00.928
Free drinks!

36:02.864 --> 36:04.565
You're disgusting.

36:04.599 --> 36:05.733
You know what?

36:05.767 --> 36:06.901
You and I, we've
gotta do something

36:06.934 --> 36:09.202
about this sexual tension
between us, don't you think?

36:09.236 --> 36:10.838
I just
puked in my mouth a little.

36:10.872 --> 36:12.573
I'm still down.

36:12.607 --> 36:13.440
On that note.

36:13.473 --> 36:14.776
Yes, party time.

36:15.843 --> 36:17.344
Let's do this.

36:17.377 --> 36:19.379
Don't worry. I've been
touring with guys for years.

36:19.413 --> 36:20.447
He's not that bad.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.415
Yo, have you seen the pisser?

36:21.448 --> 36:23.651
I got to siphon the
python before I go out.

36:23.685 --> 36:24.686
You know what I'm saying?

36:24.719 --> 36:25.787
It's over there.

36:25.820 --> 36:27.555
So helpful, I love it.

36:28.856 --> 36:29.957
Meet you guys out there.

36:30.992 --> 36:32.627
You were saying?

36:32.660 --> 36:33.828
Never mind.

36:33.861 --> 36:35.429
I'm tired.

36:35.462 --> 36:36.631
I might just call
it an early night,

36:36.664 --> 36:38.533
but you two should hang out.

36:42.503 --> 36:44.237
I'm meeting some
friends down by the lake

36:44.271 --> 36:45.807
for some late night fun.

36:45.840 --> 36:46.641
Do you wanna go?

36:46.674 --> 36:47.875
Sure, yeah.

36:47.909 --> 36:48.943
All right.

36:55.049 --> 36:55.883
All right!

37:05.660 --> 37:06.493
Whoa.

37:09.764 --> 37:12.767
Dude, dude, my stomach's
on fire right now.

37:14.434 --> 37:15.870
I blame you, man.

37:15.903 --> 37:17.538
Blame me?

37:17.572 --> 37:18.539
Why me?

37:18.573 --> 37:19.874
'Cause you were like,
"Do all the hot sauce.

37:19.907 --> 37:20.842
"Do the three drops."

37:20.875 --> 37:21.676
You don't think it
has anything to do with

37:21.709 --> 37:23.845
- the thing you just chugged?
- Mm-mm.

37:23.878 --> 37:25.847
No, it could be a mixture of
it, but it wouldn't happen

37:25.880 --> 37:27.949
if the base of the hot sauce
wasn't there right now.

37:27.982 --> 37:28.983
Mm...

37:30.985 --> 37:32.019
Oh.

37:32.854 --> 37:33.921
Sorry, dude,
bathroom's closed.

37:33.955 --> 37:34.922
Aw, come on, man.

37:34.956 --> 37:36.389
You don't understand.

37:36.423 --> 37:38.860
I'm about to have like a
nuclear assplosion here.

37:38.893 --> 37:39.761
Someone puked.

37:39.794 --> 37:40.828
You've gotta come
back in 10 minutes.

37:40.862 --> 37:41.896
10 minutes?

37:41.929 --> 37:43.898
Mm-mm, this thing's gonna
be over in two minutes.

37:43.931 --> 37:44.532
Sorry, man.

37:49.003 --> 37:51.304
- Oh!
- Hey, this is for women!

37:51.338 --> 37:52.507
Yeah, well, so is this,

37:52.540 --> 37:54.976
but his neighbor's a sick ass
you want no part of, lady.

37:55.877 --> 37:56.711
Ugh.

37:58.378 --> 38:00.447
It burns.

38:00.480 --> 38:01.816
Oh, it burns so good.

38:06.988 --> 38:08.055
All right Billy
hold on, don't go yet.

38:10.958 --> 38:11.793
All right, ready.

38:32.046 --> 38:32.880
Whew!

38:41.656 --> 38:42.824
Whoa, it really cooled down.

38:45.626 --> 38:46.961
You think I'd be
used to that by now.

38:54.135 --> 38:56.537
You trained with Jarid
back in the day, didn't you?

38:57.972 --> 38:59.874
Yeah, he started
helping me when I was 13.

39:00.942 --> 39:03.476
I wouldn't be where I am
today if it wasn't for him.

39:07.515 --> 39:10.051
And he doesn't know it,
but he was my first crush.

39:17.024 --> 39:19.560
So first Jarid,
and then Richard...

39:20.862 --> 39:22.930
sounds like you have
a thing for champions.

39:23.865 --> 39:26.701
So has he shared
his secret yet?

39:28.135 --> 39:30.838
The Jarid "holeshot"
Harper secret.

39:30.872 --> 39:31.939
No.

39:32.974 --> 39:34.474
I mean, that's...

39:36.010 --> 39:39.881
that's some... that's
some legendary stuff.

39:43.117 --> 39:45.953
You want to go back to the
motel and get some sweatshirts?

39:46.988 --> 39:48.823
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's cold.

39:53.060 --> 39:53.895
All right.

39:57.464 --> 39:59.200
Someone planning on
getting lucky tonight?

39:59.233 --> 40:01.869
Dog, he put this in my hand
when... at the restaurant.

40:03.004 --> 40:03.838
I swear.

40:04.972 --> 40:06.406
God, I'm gonna kill him.

40:09.810 --> 40:12.013
- Oh my God!
- Oh, oh, God!

40:13.180 --> 40:13.981
What is that?

40:15.583 --> 40:17.118
- Someone die in there?
- Those bastards!

40:20.487 --> 40:21.589
You know what?

40:22.723 --> 40:23.891
Let's get out of
these wet clothes

40:23.925 --> 40:25.960
and put this thing to good use.

40:25.993 --> 40:27.161
Okay, okay, slowly.

40:27.194 --> 40:28.796
That's enough.

40:28.829 --> 40:30.463
Okay, wait just a little bit.

40:30.497 --> 40:33.901
Okay, okay, go slow.

40:34.969 --> 40:35.770
Okay, oh my God.

40:35.803 --> 40:36.938
Okay, okay, okay...

40:36.971 --> 40:38.673
I can't do this anymore.

40:39.740 --> 40:41.075
Okay, okay, okay...

40:41.108 --> 40:42.343
Oh God, we're almost
there, we're almost there.

40:42.376 --> 40:43.978
- Okay, no, no, no, no, stop!
- Come on, just a little more.

40:44.011 --> 40:45.880
- Just a little more!
- It's getting too big!

40:45.913 --> 40:46.814
No, no, no.

40:46.847 --> 40:48.215
That's enough! That's enough!

40:48.249 --> 40:49.684
Okay, we're done.

40:49.717 --> 40:51.118
- We're done, we're done.
- Ooh!

40:51.152 --> 40:51.986
Ooh!

40:52.019 --> 40:53.486
Why am I holding this?

40:57.959 --> 40:59.894
I'm not so sure about this.

40:59.927 --> 41:03.197
Come on, it's gonna be
internet gold, I promise.

41:03.230 --> 41:05.733
Yeah, but I don't want
those guys mad at me.

41:05.766 --> 41:07.601
I'll edit you out, all right?

41:07.635 --> 41:09.036
They'll never even
know you were here.

41:10.705 --> 41:12.940
They are gonna be so surprised.

41:13.975 --> 41:15.042
You can say that again.

41:17.878 --> 41:18.746
Whew, I better
call it a night.

41:18.779 --> 41:20.715
I'm done, I can't
take anything else.

41:23.050 --> 41:25.152
Are you
ready for the number one

41:25.186 --> 41:28.255
exotic dance contest
in the country?

41:28.289 --> 41:31.559
Yeah!

41:31.592 --> 41:32.760
Still heading home?

41:32.793 --> 41:34.695
Nope, this'll wait.

41:34.729 --> 41:36.897
Let's welcome our
first contestant tonight.

41:36.931 --> 41:37.932
This is Summer!

41:42.003 --> 41:43.037
No way!

41:46.040 --> 41:47.041
Oh yeah!

41:47.074 --> 41:48.142
Show us your boobs!

41:54.248 --> 41:55.916
Oh my God, yes.

41:56.984 --> 41:59.253
Oh my God, show us those nips!

42:00.287 --> 42:01.122
Oh yeah.

42:02.123 --> 42:05.559
That's him! He's been
harassing me all night.

42:05.593 --> 42:06.193
Come on, buddy.

42:06.227 --> 42:07.094
Time to go.

42:07.128 --> 42:08.062
No, no, no, no.

42:08.095 --> 42:09.230
What? Come on.

42:09.263 --> 42:09.930
Jarid, Jarid.

42:09.964 --> 42:11.065
Please, please, not right now.

42:11.098 --> 42:12.266
Please, Nuke, please tell him.

42:12.299 --> 42:13.768
Come on, please!

42:13.801 --> 42:14.702
Oh my God.

42:16.203 --> 42:18.039
Well, we could go
with Dog right now,

42:18.072 --> 42:20.074
- or we could...
- Dog who?

42:20.107 --> 42:21.108
Yeah. that's what I'm saying.

42:23.077 --> 42:23.911
Oh!

42:28.949 --> 42:29.950
Come on, so what.

42:29.984 --> 42:31.085
Come on, not tonight, please.

42:31.118 --> 42:32.753
Look at this girl, come on!

42:33.788 --> 42:35.089
Come on, please, please, please.

42:35.122 --> 42:36.057
I didn't do anything wrong.

42:36.090 --> 42:36.991
I had to go to the bathroom.

42:37.024 --> 42:38.059
The guy's bathroom was closed.

42:38.092 --> 42:38.926
- You're done.
- I'm done?

42:38.959 --> 42:40.161
- You're done.
- Done for the night.

42:41.729 --> 42:42.730
All right.

42:44.932 --> 42:47.034
Hey, big guy,
how was your night?

42:47.068 --> 42:48.969
I'm not emotionally at a place

42:49.003 --> 42:51.005
to even talk about it right
now, Jarid. Thank you.

42:51.038 --> 42:53.941
You shoulda seen me
in there, first place.

42:53.974 --> 42:58.012
Oh, hey, Dog, thanks for
the drinks for the night!

42:58.045 --> 43:00.114
And thank you for
cheering me on, champ.

43:00.147 --> 43:03.217
Well, thank you for
throwing me your top.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.922
All right, I'm going
to go take a hot shower,

43:07.955 --> 43:11.592
which is like a normal
shower, but with me in it.

43:13.828 --> 43:14.862
I got nothing.

43:14.895 --> 43:15.963
Hey, why don't you ask her

43:15.996 --> 43:17.765
if she's dressed like a general,

43:17.798 --> 43:20.167
because your privates are
standing at attention.

43:20.201 --> 43:22.069
Shut up Pepe-la-puke!

43:23.871 --> 43:24.972
That laugh drives me nuts.

43:30.978 --> 43:33.180
Well, it's official.

43:33.214 --> 43:35.216
This is the worst
night of my life.

43:35.249 --> 43:36.717
I mean, what else could
go wrong, you know?

43:36.750 --> 43:37.651
I don't know.

43:40.054 --> 43:41.122
Oh!

43:42.990 --> 43:44.925
I think I just sharted my pants.

43:47.761 --> 43:49.730
You know, my team manager
has already warned me

43:49.763 --> 43:52.967
to steer clear of you, and
to stay focused on racing.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.836
Why are you so worried
about what your team thinks?

43:55.870 --> 43:58.772
Any other team would
take you in a heartbeat.

43:58.806 --> 44:00.174
Yeah but if I get fired,

44:00.207 --> 44:02.243
my contract says I can't
race for anyone else

44:02.276 --> 44:03.444
until after this season.

44:03.477 --> 44:06.046
I guess this we'll have to
keep this our little secret.

44:14.155 --> 44:14.989
Okay.

44:16.490 --> 44:17.391
I don't know.

44:18.926 --> 44:20.094
A part of me wants
to be with you,

44:20.127 --> 44:24.265
but, a part of me knows I need
to stay focused on racing.

44:24.298 --> 44:26.367
Well, let's just focus
on the parts of you

44:26.400 --> 44:27.368
that want to be with me.

44:30.337 --> 44:33.841
They say if you have to
keep a relationship a secret,

44:33.874 --> 44:35.943
then you probably
shouldn't be in it.

44:37.077 --> 44:40.014
Yeah well, they also
say you should live life

44:40.047 --> 44:43.984
near the edge because the
view is so much better.

44:45.186 --> 44:48.422
Wow, getting deep.

44:49.990 --> 44:50.925
You sound surprised.

44:52.193 --> 44:55.062
Come on, I have
so much on the line.

44:56.430 --> 45:01.802
If I clinch the women's
title before the tour ends,

45:01.835 --> 45:05.072
they're gonna let me race in
the men's class in the finals.

45:06.173 --> 45:07.942
I mean, I'll make history.

45:07.975 --> 45:10.344
I'll be the first woman to
compete against the men.

45:12.346 --> 45:15.149
Hmm, so we'll be racing
against each other.

45:16.483 --> 45:20.321
Yeah, I wonder
who'll get second?

45:20.354 --> 45:23.224
I wonder
where you learned that?

45:45.179 --> 45:46.280
It's go time.

45:54.255 --> 45:58.392
You need to take a shower
and throw those underwear away.

45:58.425 --> 45:59.994
- I'm sorry, dude.
- Yeah.

46:00.027 --> 46:02.062
This is the worst
night of my life.

46:02.096 --> 46:03.163
I'm so uncomfortable.

46:04.131 --> 46:06.166
I'm probably gonna
have to drive the truck

46:06.200 --> 46:07.234
into the lake.

46:07.268 --> 46:09.336
Yeah well, you might
as well throw me in there

46:09.370 --> 46:10.170
when you do it.

46:22.316 --> 46:24.485
Well, that's just fantastic!

46:28.355 --> 46:29.156
What do you
think you're doing!

46:29.189 --> 46:30.024
Get off of me!

46:33.227 --> 46:34.061
Get off of me!

46:35.329 --> 46:36.497
Smell that, smell that,

46:36.531 --> 46:39.033
- smell that.
- What did you eat?

46:41.035 --> 46:42.436
What are you doing, Harper?

46:42.469 --> 46:43.404
Get off of me!

46:47.975 --> 46:49.009
Kelly?

46:56.383 --> 46:57.519
That's even better!

47:06.293 --> 47:07.394
We're
at the halfway point

47:07.428 --> 47:08.862
of round six in Atlanta.

47:08.896 --> 47:10.532
Richard Hurt has been
riding aggressively

47:10.565 --> 47:11.633
and has lead from the start,

47:11.666 --> 47:14.935
but for some reason, his
lap times have dropped off.

47:14.968 --> 47:16.970
Billy Burnett has worked
his way through the pack,

47:17.004 --> 47:18.238
and is now all over our leader

47:18.272 --> 47:20.341
as they begin to lap the field.

47:20.374 --> 47:23.010
Hurt looks over at Burnett
and leaves the door wide open.

47:23.043 --> 47:26.146
Oh, there's contact and
Burnett almost goes down!

47:26.180 --> 47:27.047
Don't play into it, Billy!

47:27.081 --> 47:28.248
Get away from him!

47:28.282 --> 47:30.984
Going into the
turn and Burnett retaliates.

47:31.018 --> 47:32.119
He puts the nose of his ski

47:32.152 --> 47:34.054
right into the
back of Hurt's leg.

47:35.022 --> 47:38.325
Billy, settle
down and race smart!

47:38.359 --> 47:40.060
These
two are going at it.

47:40.094 --> 47:41.462
And there's contact again.

47:42.597 --> 47:43.598
And again!

47:46.166 --> 47:48.135
Burnett tags him back and they
head into the backstretch.

47:48.168 --> 47:50.304
Burnett and Hurt
are battling it out.

47:53.040 --> 47:55.008
Burnett goes by, but he's
carrying too much speed

47:55.042 --> 47:57.211
and overshoots the turn.

47:57.244 --> 47:59.012
Richard Hurt goes wide too.

47:59.046 --> 48:01.683
Oh, Hurt takes Burnett out!

48:01.716 --> 48:03.984
They're fighting in the
middle of the race course!

48:04.017 --> 48:05.219
I've never seen
anything like it!

48:05.252 --> 48:07.087
An official is trying
to break it up,

48:07.121 --> 48:08.155
but he's having no effect.

48:08.188 --> 48:10.625
The rivalry between these
two is out of control,

48:10.658 --> 48:12.560
and the race director
is already on his way

48:12.594 --> 48:13.961
down to the beach.

48:13.994 --> 48:15.062
Trading fiberglass
is one thing,

48:15.095 --> 48:16.063
but what you two
were doing out there

48:16.096 --> 48:18.432
is gonna get somebody
busted up in a bad way!

48:18.465 --> 48:20.067
One more incident from
either one of you,

48:20.100 --> 48:21.034
and you're off the tour!

48:21.068 --> 48:22.336
Do we have an understanding?

48:25.406 --> 48:27.040
What kind of
amateur crap was that!

48:27.074 --> 48:29.343
You're not listening to a damn
word I'm saying out there!

48:32.112 --> 48:33.447
Why do I even waist my time?

48:37.317 --> 48:38.419
Come on, Billy.

48:38.452 --> 48:39.286
Not good.

48:40.254 --> 48:41.255
Not good at all.

48:41.288 --> 48:43.090
It's not broken, okay?

48:43.123 --> 48:46.728
I'm just in a lot of pain
right now, all right?

48:46.761 --> 48:49.129
I should probably talk
to Dad about this.

48:49.163 --> 48:50.698
Is he around?

48:50.732 --> 48:52.032
He wants to talk to you.

48:54.001 --> 48:55.102
Hey, Billy.

48:55.135 --> 48:56.970
Sounds like you had
a tough weekend.

48:57.004 --> 48:59.707
Yeah, you could say that.

49:00.708 --> 49:04.144
Look, dad, I know you went
to bat getting me a sponsor

49:04.178 --> 49:07.014
and all, but things aren't
really going the way that I

49:07.047 --> 49:08.348
thought that they would.

49:08.382 --> 49:12.252
I mean, I'm pretty much in
a no-win situation here,

49:12.286 --> 49:17.057
so I think I'm going to just
cut it short and come home.

49:17.090 --> 49:18.292
Why would you want to do that?

49:18.325 --> 49:20.294
You got a successful
program going.

49:20.327 --> 49:22.329
Grim Ripper's sales are up 6%,

49:22.362 --> 49:24.064
and Jim Anderson
called me last week

49:24.097 --> 49:25.499
to tell me how happy he is.

49:25.533 --> 49:26.734
You gotta hang in there.

49:26.768 --> 49:29.704
That's great,
Dad, sales are up.

49:36.176 --> 49:39.480
Okay, we'll talk next week.

49:40.414 --> 49:44.151
And um,... we love you.

49:46.788 --> 49:47.622
Oh.

49:49.691 --> 49:54.394
He wanted me to apologize
to Jim for not winning yet.

50:02.202 --> 50:03.036
So you giving up?

50:04.772 --> 50:05.573
Is this where you
give me a pep talk

50:05.607 --> 50:07.642
and tell me that
winners don't quit?

50:08.175 --> 50:10.512
That would be pretty hypocritical of
you, wouldn't it?

50:12.179 --> 50:13.313
Were you that scared?

50:15.482 --> 50:17.552
Afraid the great Jarid
Harper wouldn't win again,

50:17.585 --> 50:19.086
so you quit instead, huh?

50:21.488 --> 50:23.457
So what are you
running home to, huh?

50:23.490 --> 50:24.726
A father who sponsored a team

50:24.759 --> 50:27.060
just to get rid of his
pain-in-the-ass kid for the summer.

50:28.195 --> 50:30.732
Look, I don't need this!

50:38.138 --> 50:39.172
Yeah, you do.

50:42.510 --> 50:43.343
So do I.

50:52.820 --> 50:54.187
Need someone to talk to?

50:57.525 --> 50:58.458
I'm a good listener.

51:01.461 --> 51:03.196
I thought you
couldn't talk to me?

51:04.632 --> 51:06.701
I can't, but I'm here.

51:11.639 --> 51:13.106
Slumming again, Kelly?

51:14.241 --> 51:15.409
We were just talking, Richard.

51:15.442 --> 51:17.110
Do you mind?

51:17.144 --> 51:18.178
Yeah, I do.

51:18.211 --> 51:18.813
We were both told an hour
ago that the truck was...

51:18.846 --> 51:19.514
I know what I was told!

51:19.547 --> 51:21.849
Kelly, your duffle bag's open.

51:21.883 --> 51:23.051
Your shit's not packed.

51:23.083 --> 51:25.185
I swear to God, it looks like
a hand grenade went off...

51:25.218 --> 51:26.153
I'll be
there in a minute!

51:26.186 --> 51:27.087
Okay, here we go.

51:27.120 --> 51:28.856
Hey, hey, hey, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:28.890 --> 51:29.891
Not worth it.

51:29.924 --> 51:30.758
Not worth it, Billy.

51:32.326 --> 51:33.795
Nice try, Richard.

51:33.828 --> 51:35.162
Provoke him into punching you

51:35.195 --> 51:36.764
so he gets kicked off the tour?

51:36.798 --> 51:38.833
You know, if you want to
continue down this road with me,

51:38.866 --> 51:40.500
I'll be happy to
show you the way.

51:46.273 --> 51:48.643
The truck leaves in two
minutes, with or without you.

51:54.515 --> 51:55.883
Promise me you won't quit.

52:03.524 --> 52:06.594
Look, Billy, I owe
you an apology, okay?

52:07.494 --> 52:08.830
I shouldn't have
said what I said.

52:11.264 --> 52:12.533
Well, neither should I.

52:15.903 --> 52:20.207
Listen, Billy, I owe
you an apology too, man.

52:20.240 --> 52:22.877
I mean, this whole
thing was my idea.

52:22.910 --> 52:26.480
But you gotta to know,
regardless of how we got here,

52:26.514 --> 52:27.882
we're in it to
win it, all right?

52:29.349 --> 52:30.918
The monks taught
me this philosophy.

52:32.620 --> 52:35.455
The cure for everything
in life is saltwater,

52:36.390 --> 52:39.761
tears, sweat, and the ocean.

52:39.794 --> 52:41.663
You've cried your tears.

52:41.696 --> 52:43.296
You've had the ocean.

52:43.330 --> 52:44.732
Now it's time to sweat.

54:21.929 --> 54:23.898
Look, if you pace
yourself in the surf,

54:24.832 --> 54:26.868
you won't wear yourself
out and make mistakes.

54:28.736 --> 54:30.470
Well, maybe if you helped
me to get the holeshot,

54:30.505 --> 54:32.707
then I wouldn't have to push
so hard coming from behind.

54:33.908 --> 54:35.643
What do you want,
more horsepower?

54:36.844 --> 54:37.845
You know what I want.

54:39.580 --> 54:41.849
You used to get the
holeshot all the time.

54:43.584 --> 54:44.886
They say you had a secret.

54:46.521 --> 54:49.557
Well, show me you
can do it my way first,

54:51.025 --> 54:53.493
then we'll talk, deal?

54:55.129 --> 54:55.963
Deal.

54:57.165 --> 55:00.735
Round seven of
the Azeo Distilleries Tour,

55:00.768 --> 55:03.470
and Bill Burnett is out in
front, leading Richard Hurt.

55:03.504 --> 55:05.907
Hurt has tried repeatedly
to retake the lead,

55:05.940 --> 55:07.875
but has not been able
to make it happen.

55:07.909 --> 55:08.843
You're doing great, Billy.

55:08.876 --> 55:09.877
Stay consistent.

55:11.112 --> 55:13.114
Burnett has been
fast, smooth and consistent.

55:13.147 --> 55:14.882
Let's take a look
back at the pass

55:14.916 --> 55:16.617
that had the fans cheering.

55:16.651 --> 55:17.952
Burnett worked his way
up through the pack

55:17.985 --> 55:19.987
and remained patient,
pressuring Hurt,

55:20.021 --> 55:21.088
waited for the right moment,

55:21.122 --> 55:23.858
and then made this great
pass to take over the lead.

55:26.761 --> 55:28.629
Hear we go, the
white flag is out!

55:28.663 --> 55:29.462
The final lap!

55:29.496 --> 55:30.497
Hurt turns it loose.

55:30.531 --> 55:31.799
They're side by side.

55:31.833 --> 55:32.733
Burnett holds him off,

55:32.767 --> 55:34.836
but Hurt is trying
everything to get by.

55:34.869 --> 55:36.537
He knows it's now or never.

55:36.571 --> 55:38.139
Hurt squeezes by on the inside,

55:38.172 --> 55:40.473
but Burnett has the
line on the next turn.

55:41.709 --> 55:42.777
Hurt dives inside.

55:44.779 --> 55:45.913
Burnett takes it back again.

55:45.947 --> 55:46.948
What a battle!

55:48.182 --> 55:49.951
Into the backstretch, they're
coming up on lapped traffic.

55:49.984 --> 55:51.384
Just three turns to go

55:51.418 --> 55:53.688
for Billy Burnett to
take home his first win.

55:55.957 --> 55:57.692
He's gonna win it!

55:57.725 --> 55:58.659
Two turns to go.

55:58.693 --> 55:59.660
Burnett gets held up
behind a lapped rider,

55:59.694 --> 56:02.830
but it looks like Hurt
is far enough behind.

56:02.864 --> 56:05.700
Oh! The lapped rider
broke the buoy loose.

56:05.733 --> 56:06.499
Burnett misses the buoy

56:06.534 --> 56:08.836
and has to go back
and pick it up.

56:08.870 --> 56:10.738
Richard Hurt inherits the win,

56:10.771 --> 56:13.140
but what a phenomenal
ride from Billy Burnett.

56:13.174 --> 56:14.709
That a boy Billy!

56:14.742 --> 56:15.475
That's how you use your mind.

56:15.509 --> 56:16.978
Get out of your head

56:17.011 --> 56:17.912
and listen to this guy.

56:17.945 --> 56:21.616
Second place, hey,
that's first loser.

56:21.649 --> 56:22.984
Congratulations, guys.

56:23.017 --> 56:23.985
So proud of you

56:24.018 --> 56:27.555
I want to punch you so
bad my fist has a boner.

56:27.588 --> 56:29.790
Don't worry about that prick.

56:34.528 --> 56:35.529
Ready.

56:35.563 --> 56:36.797
All right.

56:36.831 --> 56:38.566
So there's only one other
person in this world

56:38.599 --> 56:40.534
that I've ever shared
this secret with,

56:41.702 --> 56:44.138
and he's standing
right behind you.

56:44.171 --> 56:46.107
Yesterday, you earned it.

56:46.140 --> 56:48.743
So, if you're ready, I
gonna show you the secret.

56:48.776 --> 56:51.145
Now, when you line up
behind the rubber band,

56:51.178 --> 56:52.445
you want to swing
your arms, okay?

56:52.479 --> 56:53.480
Just like this.

56:58.519 --> 56:59.987
How is that gonna help
me get the holeshot?

57:00.888 --> 57:03.190
Look closely at the
rubber band, grasshopper.

57:05.860 --> 57:06.694
Come on, get in there.

57:07.762 --> 57:11.565
Look close, now focus on
the water droplets, okay?

57:12.600 --> 57:13.433
Let her go, Dog.

57:21.142 --> 57:23.577
You watch the drops.

57:23.611 --> 57:26.113
They start to fall as soon
as the band starts to move.

57:28.049 --> 57:29.917
That's how you get the jump.

57:32.987 --> 57:33.955
Pretty cool, huh?

57:56.143 --> 57:59.046
What is he doing?

58:00.848 --> 58:03.951
Today was a big day for him,
sharing that secret with you.

58:03.985 --> 58:06.120
Right now, he's giving
thanks to the universe.

58:06.153 --> 58:09.523
He is in this deep
spiritual dimension.

58:09.557 --> 58:11.659
I mean nothing could
break his connection.

58:13.327 --> 58:14.528
Really?

58:14.562 --> 58:15.896
Yeah, nothing.

58:15.930 --> 58:18.099
He gets deep in that zone.

58:20.334 --> 58:21.602
Take a video.

58:21.635 --> 58:22.403
Are you serious?

58:22.436 --> 58:23.871
All right, make it
quick, hurry up.

58:23.904 --> 58:24.538
Idiot.

58:26.240 --> 58:27.842
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

58:27.875 --> 58:28.843
We are fortunate
today to be witnessing

58:28.876 --> 58:32.780
Jarid Harper becoming
one with the universe.

58:32.813 --> 58:34.281
I'm told that when
he's in this state,

58:34.315 --> 58:36.917
there is nothing can
disturb his chakra.

58:39.286 --> 58:40.921
All right, take it back.

58:40.955 --> 58:42.590
No. What are you doing?

58:42.623 --> 58:44.025
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

58:44.058 --> 58:45.860
Oh, that's not funny.

58:45.893 --> 58:47.261
I told him not to do that when
you're in your spiritual...

58:47.294 --> 58:48.129
It was his idea!

58:48.162 --> 58:49.196
I know you were
in your dimension

58:49.230 --> 58:50.097
- and nobody could break it.
- He told me to do it.

58:50.131 --> 58:51.098
Look at him now.
His ass is all wet.

58:51.132 --> 58:53.300
- He told me to do it.
- Oh my God, oh my God.

58:53.334 --> 58:54.502
Don't worry about it.
Just go back to your...

58:54.535 --> 58:55.469
Go back to your, go back to
your connection. It's fine.

58:55.503 --> 58:56.037
- He's an asshole.
- Go back into it.

58:56.070 --> 58:57.571
You'll get back into it.

58:58.639 --> 59:00.641
And I love these shirts
you made for the team.

59:00.674 --> 59:01.609
So you're happy?

59:01.642 --> 59:02.276
Happy?

59:02.309 --> 59:04.211
Is a duck's ass water tight?

59:04.245 --> 59:05.713
Sales figures are coming in

59:05.746 --> 59:07.648
higher than our
best projections.

59:07.681 --> 59:08.916
Oh, that reminds me,

59:08.949 --> 59:10.851
Ted and I on Sunday are
going to this sports bar

59:10.885 --> 59:12.286
that's showing
Billy's race live.

59:12.319 --> 59:13.421
You guys gotta join us.

59:13.454 --> 59:17.725
Um, Nancy I think made
plans for us on Sunday, but...

59:17.758 --> 59:21.629
Nonsense, a chance to
see your son in action?

59:21.662 --> 59:23.631
Team Grim Ripper is there.

59:23.664 --> 59:24.331
I love it.

59:24.365 --> 59:26.000
I'll talk to her about it.

59:26.033 --> 59:27.201
Hot damn!

59:30.237 --> 59:32.907
Nice watch.

59:32.940 --> 59:34.341
- Oh yeah, you like that?
- Yeah.

59:34.375 --> 59:35.943
I landed us a local sponsor.

59:37.711 --> 59:39.947
- Boom!
- Big Grand Father Clock Shop?

59:39.980 --> 59:41.182
Mm-hmm.

59:41.215 --> 59:43.951
They gave me the Pound Foolish
Hot Water Watch, waterproof.

59:43.984 --> 59:44.885
The thing's worth
more than my life.

59:44.919 --> 59:46.120
And, check this out.

59:46.153 --> 59:48.889
For running that sticker,
they gave me two.

59:48.923 --> 59:50.091
Boom! You're welcome.

59:50.958 --> 59:51.959
Whoa, nice!

59:51.992 --> 59:53.027
I know, I know.

59:54.995 --> 59:56.030
Whoa!

59:56.063 --> 59:58.032
How do you like my new shorts?

59:58.065 --> 1:00:00.634
Wow, well you definitely
went shopping with Nuke.

1:00:00.668 --> 1:00:01.602
Your grandma called me

1:00:01.635 --> 1:00:03.237
and said she wanted her
shower curtain back.

1:00:03.270 --> 1:00:04.371
Yeah!

1:00:04.405 --> 1:00:05.806
Hey do not despair my friend.

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:07.408
I have something for you too.

1:00:07.441 --> 1:00:09.210
A book on how to pick up women.

1:00:10.211 --> 1:00:12.179
You know, I should write my
own book one of these days.

1:00:12.213 --> 1:00:13.714
Yeah right, more
like a leaflet.

1:00:13.747 --> 1:00:14.715
No, no it's true.

1:00:14.748 --> 1:00:16.717
You've heard of foreplay?

1:00:16.750 --> 1:00:20.020
Well, I invented the
five play.

1:00:20.054 --> 1:00:20.988
What is that?

1:00:21.021 --> 1:00:23.290
Ask your mother.

1:00:23.324 --> 1:00:24.892
Here.

1:00:24.925 --> 1:00:26.360
Oh man, it's so humid today.

1:00:26.393 --> 1:00:27.328
I'm not gonna wear a wetsuit.

1:00:27.361 --> 1:00:29.163
At least wear a two
mill for protection.

1:00:29.196 --> 1:00:31.031
And hide my new shorts?

1:00:31.065 --> 1:00:32.066
Oh, no.

1:00:32.099 --> 1:00:33.701
You wouldn't want to
hide those classy things.

1:00:33.734 --> 1:00:35.736
You should wear them
to the party tonight.

1:00:35.769 --> 1:00:37.004
Oh yeah.

1:00:37.037 --> 1:00:38.939
Wait, what's this big party
everybody keeps talking about?

1:00:38.973 --> 1:00:40.841
Oh, it's an annual classic.

1:00:40.875 --> 1:00:42.843
The owner of Azeo Vodka
likes to throw a big blowout

1:00:42.877 --> 1:00:44.078
before we head to the finals.

1:00:45.346 --> 1:00:46.814
Should we warn him about Mona,

1:00:46.847 --> 1:00:48.983
or let him find out on his own?

1:00:49.016 --> 1:00:50.751
Who's Mona?

1:00:50.784 --> 1:00:51.986
Mona Lott.

1:00:52.887 --> 1:00:54.021
Mona what?

1:00:54.054 --> 1:00:55.022
Mona Lott.

1:00:55.055 --> 1:00:57.892
That's her name, and
that's her reputation.

1:00:57.925 --> 1:00:59.260
Her last name
used to be Little.

1:00:59.293 --> 1:01:01.362
But after Nuke, it became a lot.

1:01:01.395 --> 1:01:02.963
Oh my God, no, no.

1:01:02.997 --> 1:01:05.032
She's just a hot cougar
who owns the club,

1:01:05.065 --> 1:01:05.966
and she hosts these
parties every year

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.769
so she can scope out
the new fresh meat.

1:01:08.802 --> 1:01:10.037
Be careful Billy.

1:01:10.070 --> 1:01:12.006
You will be filet
mignon on her menu.

1:01:18.078 --> 1:01:19.480
Nice shorts, bro.

1:01:19.514 --> 1:01:20.915
They make those for men?

1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:27.922
All right
Billy, get focused.

1:01:27.955 --> 1:01:28.989
Here we go.

1:01:29.990 --> 1:01:31.125
Show 'em your ass.

1:01:41.035 --> 1:01:42.736
Look at that
jump by Billy Burnett!

1:01:42.770 --> 1:01:44.205
I haven't seen
holeshot like that

1:01:44.238 --> 1:01:46.173
since the last time
Jarid Harper raced.

1:01:50.778 --> 1:01:53.147
Hot damn!

1:01:54.848 --> 1:01:56.383
Billy Burnett
flying out in front,

1:01:56.417 --> 1:01:59.386
taking full advantage of the
clean water ahead of him.

1:01:59.420 --> 1:02:01.055
Richard Hurt got a bad start

1:02:01.088 --> 1:02:02.456
and is well back in the pack.

1:02:06.493 --> 1:02:08.429
I like being first, boys.

1:02:14.201 --> 1:02:15.803
Richard
Hurt is moving up.

1:02:15.836 --> 1:02:17.004
He's now running in sixth.

1:02:23.444 --> 1:02:25.946
Burnett catches an
edge and goes down!

1:02:25.980 --> 1:02:28.082
He scrambles to get up
and, uh-oh, check it out,

1:02:28.115 --> 1:02:29.783
we have a full moon!

1:02:36.023 --> 1:02:37.891
Now it's a party.

1:02:37.925 --> 1:02:39.960
Houston,
we have a problem.

1:02:40.961 --> 1:02:43.063
Well at least he's
finally taking your advice

1:02:43.097 --> 1:02:46.133
and showing them his ass.

1:02:49.236 --> 1:02:51.438
We've noticed
Burnett's handle poll sticker

1:02:51.472 --> 1:02:52.139
is losing letters.

1:02:52.172 --> 1:02:54.108
We're not sure what it says now.

1:02:55.409 --> 1:02:56.877
All right Billy,
white flag's out.

1:02:56.910 --> 1:02:57.845
Richard's coming up behind you.

1:02:57.878 --> 1:02:59.514
Stay tight in the turns
and you've got this.

1:03:05.319 --> 1:03:06.320
Check
out the sticker

1:03:06.353 --> 1:03:08.222
on Burnett's handle poll now.

1:03:08.255 --> 1:03:11.892
You know what they say,
everything is bigger in Texas.

1:03:11.925 --> 1:03:13.360
Has your boy got a new sponsor

1:03:13.394 --> 1:03:15.095
or is he just proud
of his anatomy?

1:03:16.297 --> 1:03:17.131
Come on.

1:03:18.999 --> 1:03:20.301
That's great.

1:03:20.334 --> 1:03:22.836
Just a
few more turns to go.

1:03:22.870 --> 1:03:24.405
Billy Burnett is holding
off Richard Hurt,

1:03:24.438 --> 1:03:27.241
and on his way to winning
his first national event

1:03:27.274 --> 1:03:29.376
with his very own unique style.

1:03:33.347 --> 1:03:34.848
There's the checkered flag!

1:03:35.949 --> 1:03:36.817
Burnett has done it.

1:03:36.850 --> 1:03:40.187
He takes home his first win!

1:03:43.891 --> 1:03:45.092
Yeah! Yes!

1:03:46.026 --> 1:03:47.928
Yes, we dit it!

1:03:47.961 --> 1:03:49.463
That's the
biggest smile we've seen

1:03:49.496 --> 1:03:51.633
from Jarid Harper
all season long.

1:03:51.666 --> 1:03:53.601
Take a look at the
top 15 finishers,

1:03:53.635 --> 1:03:56.236
as we head down to
talk to our winner.

1:03:56.270 --> 1:03:58.072
Hey, hey bring it down!

1:03:58.105 --> 1:03:59.206
Bring it down!

1:03:59.239 --> 1:04:00.074
Um, oh!

1:04:01.975 --> 1:04:04.546
Well, as my mechanic
always says,

1:04:04.579 --> 1:04:07.081
life is like a bottle of
Grim Ripper Hot Sauce.

1:04:07.114 --> 1:04:10.184
What you do today can come
back to burn your ass tomorrow.

1:04:11.586 --> 1:04:14.888
Oh, and I also want
to bring this guy in.

1:04:14.922 --> 1:04:16.490
I owe a big thanks
to Jarid Harper.

1:04:16.524 --> 1:04:18.526
I mean, I wouldn't
be here without him.

1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:22.396
And this guy, he's been
like a father to me, so...

1:04:23.263 --> 1:04:25.065
Well,
congratulations Billy.

1:04:25.099 --> 1:04:28.636
I'm sure Jarid is proud of
you and your team right now.

1:04:28.670 --> 1:04:30.572
I know this has been
a hard fought battle

1:04:30.605 --> 1:04:31.972
to get you here today.

1:04:32.674 --> 1:04:33.842
Billy Burnett's win this weekend

1:04:33.874 --> 1:04:37.177
now moves him into second in
points behind Richard Hurt.

1:04:37.211 --> 1:04:39.647
Kelly Weber continues
her undefeated season,

1:04:39.681 --> 1:04:42.416
and her win today gives her
an insurmountable points lead

1:04:42.449 --> 1:04:44.284
going into the finals.

1:04:44.318 --> 1:04:46.420
Congratulations.

1:04:48.623 --> 1:04:50.057
Congrats to you too.

1:04:50.090 --> 1:04:52.059
Another championship
clinched, huh?

1:04:52.092 --> 1:04:55.095
Yes, and now I'll get to race
with the men in the finals.

1:04:55.129 --> 1:04:55.963
So excited.

1:04:55.996 --> 1:04:58.031
Guess I better
train extra hard now.

1:04:58.065 --> 1:04:59.133
Yeah, I think so.

1:05:00.100 --> 1:05:01.301
Hey, nice ass by the way.

1:05:01.335 --> 1:05:04.405
Hmm, I was just trying
to get your attention.

1:05:04.438 --> 1:05:06.006
Oh, well, you got it.

1:05:07.107 --> 1:05:09.143
Are you gonna go to that
the big party tonight?

1:05:09.176 --> 1:05:09.844
Oh, no.

1:05:09.878 --> 1:05:12.045
Uh, they banned Richard

1:05:12.079 --> 1:05:15.382
after an incident last
season, and our manager says

1:05:15.416 --> 1:05:18.620
our entire team is
boycotting, politics.

1:05:20.087 --> 1:05:22.322
But it's okay, we're leaving
extra early for Havasu,

1:05:22.356 --> 1:05:24.391
and going straight there to
test for the finals, so...

1:05:24.425 --> 1:05:27.027
Come on, come help
celebrate my first win.

1:05:27.060 --> 1:05:29.096
I wish I could, I'm sorry.

1:05:31.098 --> 1:05:31.932
I have to lay low.

1:05:33.133 --> 1:05:34.034
Oh, she'll be there.

1:05:34.067 --> 1:05:34.702
Gotta go. Bye!

1:05:37.705 --> 1:05:38.573
Hey thanks, Jim.

1:05:38.606 --> 1:05:39.373
No thank you, Doug.

1:05:39.406 --> 1:05:40.307
I'm very excited.

1:05:40.340 --> 1:05:41.975
I'm very excited about
everything, okay.

1:05:42.009 --> 1:05:43.143
- All right.
- I'm taking these boys out.

1:05:43.177 --> 1:05:44.646
I might not bring them back.

1:05:44.679 --> 1:05:46.180
All right, have fun, have fun!

1:05:50.785 --> 1:05:52.286
Hey, this is Billy.

1:05:52.319 --> 1:05:56.558
Leave a message cause I
am going, going, gone!

1:05:59.359 --> 1:06:00.762
Welcome to the party.

1:06:00.795 --> 1:06:01.596
Enjoy yourselves.

1:06:01.629 --> 1:06:03.497
This dog is ready
to hunt tonight!

1:06:04.364 --> 1:06:06.166
Yeah, well, did you read
that book Nuke got you?

1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:07.167
Nah, I tried.

1:06:07.201 --> 1:06:09.269
It was a bunch of crap
about listening to women

1:06:09.303 --> 1:06:10.705
and respecting their feelings.

1:06:10.738 --> 1:06:12.272
I don't know, it seems
like a lot of work.

1:06:12.306 --> 1:06:13.675
Well, could you
at just least try

1:06:13.708 --> 1:06:15.777
to use a little subtlety
in your approach tonight?

1:06:15.810 --> 1:06:16.977
Sure.

1:06:17.010 --> 1:06:18.746
For you, champ, it'll be a
kinder, gentler, Dog tonight,

1:06:18.780 --> 1:06:20.080
all right?

1:06:20.113 --> 1:06:20.882
Hello.

1:06:20.915 --> 1:06:22.249
Welcome to the
Azeo Vodka party.

1:06:22.282 --> 1:06:23.083
Well, thank you so much.

1:06:23.116 --> 1:06:25.052
That's quite a
grip you got there.

1:06:25.085 --> 1:06:26.754
Yeah, I grew up
on a dairy farm,

1:06:26.788 --> 1:06:29.056
and that's my tit
squeezing hand.

1:06:29.089 --> 1:06:31.058
That's quite a coincidence,
'cause it's mine too.

1:06:31.091 --> 1:06:33.695
Eight
seconds, wow, good job.

1:06:33.728 --> 1:06:37.164
- Amazing,
this guy's still single?

1:06:37.197 --> 1:06:38.232
Hey, Ryan.

1:06:38.265 --> 1:06:39.366
Thanks so much for having us.

1:06:39.399 --> 1:06:42.069
Hey Billy, this is Ryan Horn,
the owner of Azeo Vodka.

1:06:42.102 --> 1:06:44.438
- Ryan, this...
- I know who he is.

1:06:44.471 --> 1:06:45.707
Nice ridin' today, Billy.

1:06:45.740 --> 1:06:48.543
And the way you gave 'ol Dick
Hurt the brown eye like that,

1:06:48.576 --> 1:06:50.745
I nearly pissed myself.

1:06:50.778 --> 1:06:52.346
Come on in, boys,
let's get after it.

1:06:52.379 --> 1:06:53.280
- All right.
- Sweet.

1:06:55.650 --> 1:06:58.051
Jarid Harper!

1:06:58.085 --> 1:07:01.154
Mona, how you doing?

1:07:01.188 --> 1:07:02.089
Even better if you tell me

1:07:02.122 --> 1:07:04.191
you came back to take
me up on my offer.

1:07:04.224 --> 1:07:05.527
Oh, you know, Mona,

1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:07.094
I've been known to do
a little pinch hitting

1:07:07.127 --> 1:07:09.096
for Jarid from time to time.

1:07:10.197 --> 1:07:12.700
Speaking of pinch hitters,
young Billy Burnett,

1:07:13.701 --> 1:07:15.570
I'm having a hall of fame
ceremony later tonight

1:07:15.603 --> 1:07:17.839
and I'm confident
you'll be inducted.

1:07:17.872 --> 1:07:18.773
I'll come find you.

1:07:22.710 --> 1:07:23.511
Run.

1:07:24.444 --> 1:07:27.114
She is going to come find you.

1:07:35.557 --> 1:07:37.391
Dude, why are you
doing this to yourself?

1:07:37.424 --> 1:07:39.192
Let's go somewhere else.

1:07:39.226 --> 1:07:40.762
I've got my reasons.

1:07:47.869 --> 1:07:49.804
Look at this guy, sickening.

1:07:49.837 --> 1:07:51.806
Oui, oui, I am zee
king of bullshit.

1:07:51.839 --> 1:07:54.107
If you don't believe
me, just ask me.

1:07:54.141 --> 1:07:55.810
I am zee best. What an idiot.

1:07:57.144 --> 1:07:58.412
You know, we may
have to reel Billy in.

1:07:58.445 --> 1:08:00.848
He's starting to
party pretty hard.

1:08:03.918 --> 1:08:05.485
Don't worry, I'll
keep an eye on him.

1:08:06.420 --> 1:08:08.656
Great, I feel a
whole lot better now.

1:08:08.690 --> 1:08:09.624
Good, you should.

1:08:11.593 --> 1:08:13.861
- Cheers.
- Cheers, gentlemen.

1:08:13.895 --> 1:08:15.095
- To victory.
- To...

1:08:19.232 --> 1:08:21.703
- Ugh.
- Billy, come on.

1:08:22.937 --> 1:08:27.140
Oh, Billy come on.

1:08:27.174 --> 1:08:27.809
Yo...

1:08:29.877 --> 1:08:31.579
Do you mind
if we take a picture?

1:08:31.613 --> 1:08:32.412
Not at all.

1:08:32.446 --> 1:08:34.214
Oh, thank you so much.

1:08:34.247 --> 1:08:36.216
- Oh, of you guys?
- Yeah, please.

1:08:36.249 --> 1:08:37.719
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:08:37.752 --> 1:08:39.152
- Oh, okay.
- Sorry.

1:08:39.854 --> 1:08:42.523
Say, "Doggy style."

1:08:42.557 --> 1:08:43.423
Uh-uh.

1:08:43.457 --> 1:08:45.192
You are
beautiful, honey.

1:08:45.225 --> 1:08:46.694
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

1:08:46.728 --> 1:08:47.895
I am such a fan.

1:08:47.929 --> 1:08:48.896
Thank you.

1:08:48.930 --> 1:08:50.531
I'm a fan of yours.

1:08:50.565 --> 1:08:52.232
Mm!

1:08:53.901 --> 1:08:56.269
Man, this is unbelievable.

1:08:56.303 --> 1:08:57.839
Billy's in the middle
of a feeding frenzy.

1:08:57.872 --> 1:08:59.439
Nuke's got a net full.

1:08:59.473 --> 1:09:02.242
You, you've got one on the
hook and just let one go.

1:09:02.275 --> 1:09:05.312
Me, I can't even get a nibble.

1:09:06.346 --> 1:09:08.650
Maybe if you were
fishing with a bigger worm?

1:09:08.683 --> 1:09:10.885
That's hilarious.

1:09:10.918 --> 1:09:11.919
Hey, what's your deal anyway?

1:09:11.953 --> 1:09:14.555
I mean, you got all
those hot chicks on tour.

1:09:14.589 --> 1:09:15.890
Why don't just pluck one out

1:09:15.923 --> 1:09:18.392
and make her your trophy
wife or something?

1:09:18.425 --> 1:09:20.928
There's more to relationships
than physical attraction.

1:09:20.962 --> 1:09:22.030
Okay, yeah well,
if you leave now,

1:09:22.063 --> 1:09:24.799
you can catch the Katherine
Heigl double feature.

1:09:26.968 --> 1:09:27.769
No, I mean, I get it.

1:09:27.802 --> 1:09:30.270
I could get on that
page, you know.

1:09:30.303 --> 1:09:31.371
That's what I'm looking
for here tonight,

1:09:31.405 --> 1:09:34.207
just like a deep meaningless
relationship, you know?

1:09:34.241 --> 1:09:36.811
No, no, all right,
seriously, seriously,

1:09:36.844 --> 1:09:39.379
seriously, I get where
you're coming from.

1:09:39.413 --> 1:09:42.917
I would just give anything
to like find a special girl

1:09:42.950 --> 1:09:46.688
to just you know, love,
confide in, to cherish,

1:09:46.721 --> 1:09:50.958
and just like respect
everything, just

1:09:50.992 --> 1:09:53.928
Oh my God, look at the
taters on this little model.

1:10:07.542 --> 1:10:08.910
I'm so sick of this crap.

1:10:11.846 --> 1:10:13.280
Let's go.

1:10:54.522 --> 1:10:56.356
There's the man of the hour.

1:10:57.424 --> 1:11:00.027
You haven't had your
Mona Lott shot, have you?

1:11:00.061 --> 1:11:01.863
Um...

1:11:01.896 --> 1:11:04.331
Open wide, I'm coming
in.

1:11:04.364 --> 1:11:06.399
Oops, let me get that.

1:11:19.046 --> 1:11:19.881
Kelly?

1:11:22.016 --> 1:11:23.951
No, no, Kelly!

1:11:23.985 --> 1:11:24.919
Dude, you're losing it.

1:11:24.952 --> 1:11:25.953
She's not even worth it.

1:11:25.987 --> 1:11:27.889
I'm not losing anything!

1:11:27.922 --> 1:11:29.857
Yeah well, we
could lose our jobs.

1:11:29.891 --> 1:11:31.859
Are you with me or against me?

1:11:33.393 --> 1:11:34.361
All right.

1:11:34.394 --> 1:11:35.530
Yeah, let's do it.

1:11:36.396 --> 1:11:37.364
All right, cool.

1:11:45.973 --> 1:11:47.875
Kelly, Kelly!

1:11:48.876 --> 1:11:51.045
Congratulations on getting
in Mona's hall of fame.

1:11:51.078 --> 1:11:53.514
- I was...
- Just go, I've got this.

1:11:53.548 --> 1:11:54.982
I wasn't kissing her.

1:11:55.016 --> 1:11:57.652
I thought you were different
from the rest of these guys!

1:11:57.685 --> 1:11:59.554
She was crazy about you!

1:11:59.587 --> 1:12:01.622
She was the best thing
that's ever happened to you,

1:12:01.656 --> 1:12:02.890
and you just threw it away!

1:12:04.025 --> 1:12:05.760
Look, stay away from my friends!

1:12:07.061 --> 1:12:08.495
I wasn't kissing...

1:12:13.100 --> 1:12:14.902
Hey, Billy, your
ski's on fire!

1:12:14.936 --> 1:12:15.970
What?

1:12:19.874 --> 1:12:20.708
My ski.

1:12:44.632 --> 1:12:45.666
Hey, Jim.

1:12:45.700 --> 1:12:48.102
Hey, bud, I just wanted
to call and let you know

1:12:48.135 --> 1:12:50.872
I won't be able to wire
you that next payment.

1:12:52.073 --> 1:12:52.974
What's going on?

1:12:54.041 --> 1:12:56.978
Um, I'm going on vacation.

1:12:57.912 --> 1:12:59.647
Vacation?

1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:03.618
Sausage was discovered in
the sauce.

1:13:03.651 --> 1:13:06.988
Sausage, I don't understand,
why is that a problem?

1:13:07.922 --> 1:13:11.025
I mean, you're not advertising
it's kosher are you?

1:13:11.058 --> 1:13:12.860
It wasn't kosher with my wife.

1:13:12.894 --> 1:13:14.929
It was my sausage in
my secretary's sauce.

1:13:14.962 --> 1:13:16.564
She's pissed.

1:13:16.597 --> 1:13:18.566
She turned my books
over to the IRS.

1:13:18.599 --> 1:13:20.534
The FBI is here now
seizing everything.

1:13:20.568 --> 1:13:23.704
Oh God, I'm gonna
probably do 5 to 10, bud.

1:13:23.738 --> 1:13:24.572
Oh! Oh!

1:13:24.605 --> 1:13:25.940
Avenge me, Douglas!

1:13:25.973 --> 1:13:26.807
Jim?

1:13:30.645 --> 1:13:32.046
- What's that about?
- Nah,

1:13:34.949 --> 1:13:37.118
- Just Jim being Jim.
- Hmm.

1:13:37.151 --> 1:13:38.119
Hi, it's Kelly.

1:13:38.152 --> 1:13:41.622
Catch me if you can, or
just leave me a message.

1:13:42.323 --> 1:13:44.692
Hey, hey, Kelly, it's me.

1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:48.062
I don't know if
you heard or not,

1:13:48.095 --> 1:13:50.932
but I lost my sponsor
and everything,

1:13:50.965 --> 1:13:55.603
so I'm not going to be
seeing you at the finals.

1:13:56.469 --> 1:13:58.839
Listen, I really
want to talk to you

1:13:58.873 --> 1:14:01.075
and explain everything
that happened.

1:14:01.108 --> 1:14:02.944
If you could give me
a call that would,

1:14:04.011 --> 1:14:05.179
that would be...

1:14:06.180 --> 1:14:06.881
great.

1:14:44.952 --> 1:14:46.287
You can crash
here for a while,

1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:48.022
until you're ready
to head back to LA.

1:14:50.658 --> 1:14:52.159
That's the last
place I want to go.

1:14:55.896 --> 1:14:57.064
I can just hear my Dad.

1:14:59.266 --> 1:15:01.168
Somehow this is all
gonna be my fault.

1:15:04.572 --> 1:15:05.206
Your choice.

1:15:07.041 --> 1:15:08.843
I don't know if I'd want
to be here in Havasu

1:15:08.876 --> 1:15:10.211
when the championships
are going on.

1:15:11.979 --> 1:15:12.813
Just saying.

1:15:48.749 --> 1:15:49.583
Kelly!

1:15:51.752 --> 1:15:52.920
Kelly!

1:16:41.102 --> 1:16:43.137
Shouldn't you get back to LA?

1:16:43.170 --> 1:16:45.706
You know, open up your shop?

1:16:45.739 --> 1:16:47.074
I can't work like this.

1:16:47.975 --> 1:16:49.677
I feel like a jackass, man.

1:16:50.444 --> 1:16:51.745
I mean, I'm the one
that talked Billy's dad

1:16:51.779 --> 1:16:52.581
into this whole mess.

1:16:52.613 --> 1:16:55.049
And now, they aren't
even speaking.

1:16:57.051 --> 1:16:59.320
Well, you kind of talked
us all into this mess.

1:17:00.921 --> 1:17:03.124
Look, it's not your
fault, all right?

1:17:03.157 --> 1:17:04.158
We're in this together.

1:17:05.426 --> 1:17:06.794
We'll get through it together.

1:17:06.827 --> 1:17:07.928
How?

1:17:07.962 --> 1:17:10.197
How are we gonna get
through this, hm?

1:17:10.231 --> 1:17:11.432
Ski's destroyed.

1:17:11.465 --> 1:17:13.834
We're not seeing a dime of that
money Grimm Ripper owes us.

1:17:15.069 --> 1:17:18.873
So much for all that universe
will make it right stuff, huh?

1:17:21.475 --> 1:17:23.077
What are we even doing here?

1:17:24.044 --> 1:17:25.813
What are we doing here?

1:17:28.282 --> 1:17:32.853
The monks, they ah...
pray like everything

1:17:32.887 --> 1:17:33.988
depends on the universe.

1:17:35.055 --> 1:17:38.959
Work like everything
depends on you.

1:17:45.399 --> 1:17:46.233
What is that?

1:17:47.201 --> 1:17:48.035
What's the plan?

1:17:50.905 --> 1:17:52.306
You can't just say
that and then run away.

1:17:53.207 --> 1:17:54.808
I didn't train with the monks.

1:17:54.842 --> 1:17:55.943
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:17:58.078 --> 1:18:00.047
Hi, you must be Nancy.

1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:00.948
Oh, hi.

1:18:00.981 --> 1:18:01.782
Jarid Harper.

1:18:01.815 --> 1:18:02.584
Hi!

1:18:02.617 --> 1:18:03.784
Oh yes, I've heard
all about you.

1:18:03.817 --> 1:18:05.085
Come on in.

1:18:05.119 --> 1:18:06.086
Lovely to meet you.

1:18:06.120 --> 1:18:07.054
Nice to meet you too.

1:18:09.089 --> 1:18:10.958
I was wondering if I
could speak with Douglas.

1:18:10.991 --> 1:18:13.060
Yes, yes, he's in the office.

1:18:13.093 --> 1:18:14.929
Douglas, Jarid is here.

1:18:16.096 --> 1:18:16.764
Thank you.

1:18:16.797 --> 1:18:17.965
I'm just wrapping up a call.

1:18:17.998 --> 1:18:19.033
Come on in.

1:18:19.867 --> 1:18:21.068
Right.

1:18:21.101 --> 1:18:22.303
No, just text me.

1:18:25.472 --> 1:18:27.741
Okay, yeah, it'll be there.

1:18:27.775 --> 1:18:28.776
Okay, see you, bye.

1:18:32.846 --> 1:18:34.448
Nice to finally meet you, Jarid.

1:18:34.481 --> 1:18:35.349
You too, Douglas.

1:18:36.450 --> 1:18:38.752
I'm sorry about the
sponsorship not working out.

1:18:39.787 --> 1:18:41.255
Nobody could've
seen that coming.

1:18:42.156 --> 1:18:44.959
Yeah, it's a bummer.

1:18:46.293 --> 1:18:48.128
Hey, grab a seat, man.

1:18:54.868 --> 1:18:56.971
When did you guys get back?

1:18:57.004 --> 1:18:58.806
I haven't heard from Billy.

1:18:58.839 --> 1:19:02.209
Oh, well, he's...
staying with a friend.

1:19:05.312 --> 1:19:07.481
He must be disappointed.

1:19:07.515 --> 1:19:11.185
Yeah, yeah, on a
number of levels.

1:19:19.026 --> 1:19:22.997
He knows about
the arrangement?

1:19:24.331 --> 1:19:26.367
Yeah, you know,
he's a smart kid.

1:19:28.402 --> 1:19:29.503
Hell, he's not a kid anymore.

1:19:29.537 --> 1:19:31.305
You'd be surprised.

1:19:33.140 --> 1:19:35.075
You know, he's second in points.

1:19:36.944 --> 1:19:38.546
He could've won
the championship.

1:19:40.347 --> 1:19:41.382
You know, I ah...

1:19:43.017 --> 1:19:45.886
I lost my dad when I was 16.

1:19:48.255 --> 1:19:49.857
The really sad part is that

1:19:49.890 --> 1:19:51.792
we hadn't been getting
along for years.

1:19:53.294 --> 1:19:56.163
I actually thought I
hated him at the time.

1:19:58.866 --> 1:20:00.100
The reality now is,..

1:20:02.036 --> 1:20:05.439
I'd give anything
to have him back.

1:20:10.077 --> 1:20:11.812
Don't think that
I don't feel bad...

1:20:13.314 --> 1:20:15.816
about my relationship...

1:20:17.117 --> 1:20:18.986
not working with my son but,..

1:20:21.656 --> 1:20:24.458
I'd do anything to fix it.

1:20:25.492 --> 1:20:27.294
Look, I'm sure
you do feel bad.

1:20:28.596 --> 1:20:32.132
I mean, anyone who's received
the world's greatest dad award

1:20:32.166 --> 1:20:33.367
kind of has to feel bad.

1:20:35.502 --> 1:20:36.337
Wow.

1:20:41.442 --> 1:20:45.613
You know, I made one hell of
a mistake giving up on myself

1:20:45.647 --> 1:20:47.549
when I should've fought through

1:20:47.582 --> 1:20:49.016
and finished things
the right way.

1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:55.923
Don't give up on your son
when he still has a chance.

1:20:59.993 --> 1:21:03.464
Well, so what are you,..
what are you thinking?

1:21:20.981 --> 1:21:21.616
Billy.

1:21:23.984 --> 1:21:24.985
What are you doing here?

1:21:26.153 --> 1:21:26.987
Remember this?

1:21:29.591 --> 1:21:31.992
It's been a long time
since I've been that dad.

1:21:33.026 --> 1:21:36.096
I want to apologize for
not being there for you,

1:21:37.297 --> 1:21:41.368
and I need help
solving a big problem.

1:21:42.604 --> 1:21:45.105
I mean, should it be
called team Burnett,

1:21:47.642 --> 1:21:49.243
or team Camaro?

1:21:50.144 --> 1:21:51.378
What're you talking about?

1:21:51.412 --> 1:21:52.614
What are you doing here?

1:21:52.647 --> 1:21:54.915
Team Burnett has
a nice ring to it.

1:21:56.083 --> 1:21:59.119
Yeah, I like
the sound of that.

1:21:59.153 --> 1:22:00.555
Well, it's just too bad

1:22:00.588 --> 1:22:02.624
you didn't own an old
classic Ford woody.

1:22:04.191 --> 1:22:05.627
We could've been
called Team Woody.

1:22:05.660 --> 1:22:06.460
That would've been epic.

1:22:06.493 --> 1:22:09.196
Oh okay, Dog,
Team Burnett it is.

1:22:09.229 --> 1:22:12.466
Your dad sold his car so you
can go to the championships.

1:22:14.101 --> 1:22:15.135
Dad, that was your, your...

1:22:15.169 --> 1:22:16.003
My baby.

1:22:17.204 --> 1:22:19.406
I sold it for you, man.

1:22:24.211 --> 1:22:25.647
I can't believe
you would do that.

1:22:28.583 --> 1:22:30.284
Well, are we going to stand
around here yapping about it,

1:22:30.317 --> 1:22:32.386
or are we going to go racing?

1:22:33.621 --> 1:22:34.622
Everybody in here.

1:22:34.656 --> 1:22:36.123
On three, Team Burnett.

1:22:39.126 --> 1:22:41.028
This is gonna be
the greatest comeback

1:22:41.061 --> 1:22:43.096
in Team Burnett history.

1:22:43.130 --> 1:22:44.131
One, two, three.

1:22:44.164 --> 1:22:45.199
Team Burnett!

1:23:10.424 --> 1:23:12.292
The first woman to
compete against the men

1:23:12.326 --> 1:23:13.260
at world finals.

1:23:13.293 --> 1:23:15.395
What are you feeling right now?

1:23:15.429 --> 1:23:17.030
So many things.

1:23:17.064 --> 1:23:18.098
It's quite amazing.

1:23:18.131 --> 1:23:21.401
A lot of dreams are coming
true today, so it's big.

1:23:21.435 --> 1:23:23.203
That's what she
said.

1:23:25.507 --> 1:23:26.808
I've been to the top of this
mountain four times already.

1:23:26.841 --> 1:23:27.742
I've got the points lead,

1:23:27.775 --> 1:23:29.109
and I only need to
finish 10th or better

1:23:29.142 --> 1:23:30.077
to take home the championship.

1:23:30.110 --> 1:23:32.246
So, would you bet against me?

1:23:35.349 --> 1:23:37.519
My mechanic, he's been
up for three days straight

1:23:37.552 --> 1:23:38.620
building my new ski.

1:23:39.787 --> 1:23:42.089
My entire team has been amazing.

1:23:43.357 --> 1:23:44.157
My message to the competition

1:23:44.191 --> 1:23:46.093
is to nut up and
put the wood to it.

1:23:46.126 --> 1:23:47.060
Let's get it on.

1:23:47.094 --> 1:23:47.795
May the best man win.

1:23:50.732 --> 1:23:53.835
Kelly, I've been trying
to call you for weeks.

1:23:53.868 --> 1:23:55.770
Look, I promise you I
didn't do anything, I...

1:23:55.803 --> 1:23:58.405
Let's just focus on what's
important today, okay?

1:24:03.878 --> 1:24:05.747
You can feel
the electricity in the air

1:24:05.780 --> 1:24:06.748
and the stage is set.

1:24:06.781 --> 1:24:09.182
Billy Burnett's team has
burned the midnight oil

1:24:09.216 --> 1:24:13.186
putting together a new Pro
Force 2.0, but it's untested.

1:24:13.220 --> 1:24:15.322
And rumor has it that
Broward Motorsports

1:24:15.355 --> 1:24:18.693
has upgraded Richard Hurt's
ski with 20 more horsepower

1:24:18.726 --> 1:24:20.562
than he's had all season long.

1:24:20.595 --> 1:24:22.830
It's going to be interesting.

1:24:22.864 --> 1:24:23.898
So how you holding up, pal?

1:24:23.932 --> 1:24:27.669
Oh man, I am running
on fumes, but we made it.

1:24:29.303 --> 1:24:30.738
Yeah, well, you'll
sleep good tonight, huh?

1:24:30.772 --> 1:24:31.873
Mm-hm.

1:24:31.906 --> 1:24:33.140
You got this.

1:24:38.846 --> 1:24:39.814
What's on your mind, Billy?

1:24:40.748 --> 1:24:42.784
How are we gonna
compete against Richard

1:24:42.817 --> 1:24:44.786
when he's running on
20 more horsepower?

1:24:46.486 --> 1:24:47.589
Even if he does
get the holeshot,

1:24:47.622 --> 1:24:48.590
it's not gonna matter.

1:24:48.623 --> 1:24:51.693
Once it gets rough out
there, it's all rider.

1:24:51.726 --> 1:24:52.727
You can outride him.

1:24:54.361 --> 1:24:56.496
Just go out there
and show them your ass.

1:25:45.245 --> 1:25:47.280
Frankie
Zapata on his Flyboard Air

1:25:47.314 --> 1:25:49.449
doing a flyby, as we
prepare for the race

1:25:49.483 --> 1:25:50.852
we've all been waiting for.

1:25:50.885 --> 1:25:52.486
Fasten your seat belts, folks.

1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:54.956
We're about to go ballistic
here in Lake Havasu.

1:25:58.926 --> 1:26:00.828
Blake Corning lights the fuse.

1:26:00.862 --> 1:26:02.295
- Here we go!
- It's dead!

1:26:02.329 --> 1:26:03.765
- What?
- It's dead, it's dead!

1:26:03.798 --> 1:26:05.298
Oh, come on, come on! Help
me get it out! Let's go!

1:26:05.332 --> 1:26:06.801
Burnett
has a problem on the line

1:26:06.834 --> 1:26:08.301
and they're shutting them down.

1:26:08.335 --> 1:26:11.204
He'll have two minutes
to get it sorted out.

1:26:18.546 --> 1:26:19.914
The start button
wire's been cut.

1:26:19.947 --> 1:26:20.948
Short the solenoid.

1:26:20.982 --> 1:26:21.816
I'm trying.

1:26:22.717 --> 1:26:23.885
Less
than a minute left,

1:26:23.918 --> 1:26:24.952
and I would not want to be

1:26:24.986 --> 1:26:26.888
in Billy Burnett's
shoes right now.

1:26:30.490 --> 1:26:31.592
Come on, come on, come on!

1:26:31.626 --> 1:26:33.961
15 seconds, you
have 15 seconds!

1:26:33.995 --> 1:26:35.596
- Come on, Dog!
- I'm trying.

1:26:36.664 --> 1:26:38.498
The
two-minute hold has expired.

1:26:38.533 --> 1:26:40.868
Burnett's team is frantically
trying to get him going,

1:26:40.902 --> 1:26:42.335
but it doesn't look good.

1:26:45.338 --> 1:26:46.273
They're off the line

1:26:46.306 --> 1:26:48.275
and Billy Burnett is
left dead on the beach.

1:26:52.013 --> 1:26:54.849
It's a drag race to the
first turn, and check it out,

1:26:54.882 --> 1:26:57.384
Kelly Weber has the holeshot.

1:26:57.417 --> 1:26:58.251
Can you believe it?

1:26:58.285 --> 1:27:00.353
The first woman to
race with the men,

1:27:00.387 --> 1:27:02.757
and she's out in front.

1:27:02.790 --> 1:27:03.925
Come on, come on!

1:27:03.958 --> 1:27:06.561
Kelly Weber
leading the pack on lap one.

1:27:06.594 --> 1:27:07.895
On the beach, Billy
Burnett's team

1:27:07.929 --> 1:27:09.864
is still trying
to get him going.

1:27:09.897 --> 1:27:11.733
He may be able to
get into the race,

1:27:11.766 --> 1:27:14.902
but him dream for a
championship is long gone.

1:27:14.936 --> 1:27:16.871
Richard Hurt is
now in second place

1:27:16.904 --> 1:27:18.940
and putting the
pressure on Kelly Weber,

1:27:18.973 --> 1:27:20.575
but she is standing strong.

1:27:21.609 --> 1:27:24.912
Come on, come on, come on!

1:27:26.313 --> 1:27:28.950
- Come on, come on.
- Oh, I need sleep, guys.

1:27:28.983 --> 1:27:30.852
- Come on, come on!
- Stay ready!

1:27:30.885 --> 1:27:31.986
Stay ready!

1:27:32.019 --> 1:27:33.286
Stay ready! Stay ready!

1:27:34.522 --> 1:27:35.523
- Come on!
- Come On!

1:27:35.556 --> 1:27:37.992
Yes!

1:27:38.025 --> 1:27:39.861
Oh my God. Go. Go. Billy.

1:27:39.894 --> 1:27:42.462
They've got
Billy Burnett's ski fired up.

1:27:42.496 --> 1:27:43.564
He is up and running.

1:27:44.632 --> 1:27:46.000
- Go!
- That's it, baby!

1:27:48.069 --> 1:27:50.270
This thing is not over,
Billy. It's not over!

1:27:51.906 --> 1:27:52.507
Kelly
Weber out in front

1:27:52.540 --> 1:27:53.975
holding off Richard Hurt.

1:27:54.008 --> 1:27:54.976
Hurt gets by.

1:27:55.009 --> 1:27:57.645
Weber dives back inside
and retakes the lead!

1:27:57.678 --> 1:27:59.446
She is one tough competitor,

1:27:59.479 --> 1:28:01.048
tougher than a $2 steak,

1:28:01.082 --> 1:28:03.551
and determined to make
history this weekend.

1:28:08.022 --> 1:28:09.023
Take your time, Richard.

1:28:09.056 --> 1:28:09.824
Ride smart.

1:28:09.857 --> 1:28:11.659
Get
her out of my way!

1:28:13.127 --> 1:28:15.328
Richard Hurt
trying everything in his arsenal

1:28:15.362 --> 1:28:16.764
to get by his teammate.

1:28:16.798 --> 1:28:18.866
Hurt pulls next to Kelly Weber.

1:28:18.900 --> 1:28:20.768
They're side by side.

1:28:20.802 --> 1:28:22.003
I warned you!

1:28:23.104 --> 1:28:24.504
He bumps her, oh!

1:28:24.539 --> 1:28:26.641
Hurt sends Kelly Weber
right into the buoy.

1:28:26.674 --> 1:28:28.576
Unbelievable!

1:28:28.609 --> 1:28:30.812
He just took out
his own teammate!

1:28:32.013 --> 1:28:33.915
And the crowd can't
believe what just happened.

1:28:38.553 --> 1:28:40.721
Billy Burnett has caught
the back of the pack

1:28:40.755 --> 1:28:42.489
and is starting to
pick riders off.

1:28:46.994 --> 1:28:48.763
And attrition begins
to take it's toll,

1:28:48.796 --> 1:28:51.364
as riders are dropping out
with mechanical problems.

1:28:52.967 --> 1:28:55.036
Kelly Weber has
remounted her ski.

1:28:55.069 --> 1:28:56.637
She signals she's okay,

1:28:56.671 --> 1:28:59.841
but she no doubt had her
bell rung on that get off.

1:28:59.874 --> 1:29:00.775
Back on our leader Richard Hurt,

1:29:00.808 --> 1:29:03.476
out in front and he's
absolutely flying.

1:29:10.084 --> 1:29:12.854
Billy Burnett continues to
battle his way through the pack.

1:29:12.887 --> 1:29:14.421
He is currently in 12th.

1:29:28.836 --> 1:29:29.804
The halfway mark,

1:29:29.837 --> 1:29:31.706
and Richard Hurt still
has a commanding lead

1:29:31.739 --> 1:29:32.940
over the rest of the field.

1:29:35.109 --> 1:29:36.544
How we looking?

1:29:36.577 --> 1:29:37.812
Well, Richard's slowing down.

1:29:37.845 --> 1:29:39.947
He's probably saving his motor.

1:29:39.981 --> 1:29:42.850
We're gaining, but it's
not going to be enough.

1:29:42.884 --> 1:29:44.018
We're gonna need a miracle.

1:29:45.219 --> 1:29:46.053
You smell that?

1:29:47.088 --> 1:29:47.922
Smell what?

1:29:49.090 --> 1:29:50.791
A miracle.

1:29:50.825 --> 1:29:51.792
Richard just went by.

1:29:51.826 --> 1:29:53.961
I smell burning rubber.

1:29:53.995 --> 1:29:56.163
He's not slowing down
to save his engine.

1:29:56.197 --> 1:29:57.999
He's burning an exhaust hose.

1:30:01.903 --> 1:30:02.970
Billy, listen.

1:30:03.004 --> 1:30:04.939
You're running a great race
just like we practiced,

1:30:04.972 --> 1:30:06.874
but we're changing plans.

1:30:06.908 --> 1:30:08.576
I want you to ride
like the old Billy.

1:30:08.609 --> 1:30:09.677
Pin it to win it, baby.

1:30:09.710 --> 1:30:10.711
Pin it to win it!

1:30:12.713 --> 1:30:14.148
Burnett has
turned on the afterburners

1:30:14.181 --> 1:30:16.117
and is on the ragged edge.

1:30:16.150 --> 1:30:18.085
He's blowing by
riders, left and right.

1:30:19.153 --> 1:30:21.454
He cuts off a rider
just before the log jump

1:30:21.488 --> 1:30:23.524
and sends him into it!

1:30:23.557 --> 1:30:25.026
The crowd is loving it,

1:30:25.059 --> 1:30:27.561
as Billy Burnett has
pulled out all the stops.

1:30:40.942 --> 1:30:41.876
You think that helps?

1:30:41.909 --> 1:30:43.611
Yes.

1:30:51.719 --> 1:30:53.254
Burnett is flying!

1:30:53.287 --> 1:30:56.157
He's in third place, and
is reeling in second!

1:31:00.895 --> 1:31:02.997
We've gotta get
closer, come on.

1:31:03.030 --> 1:31:04.665
Richard
Hurt remains in front,

1:31:04.699 --> 1:31:07.935
but his lead has dropped
to just four seconds.

1:31:07.969 --> 1:31:09.170
At this point, I'm
sure he's aware

1:31:09.203 --> 1:31:11.105
that Burnett is coming up quick.

1:31:20.948 --> 1:31:23.250
Burnett gets by Kole
Cramer for second!

1:31:24.618 --> 1:31:25.753
That's what I'm talking about!

1:31:25.786 --> 1:31:26.821
Bump it right there!

1:31:26.854 --> 1:31:27.487
B-burn now!

1:31:28.889 --> 1:31:29.991
Okay, Billy, here's the plan.

1:31:30.024 --> 1:31:32.159
Do not pass Richard.

1:31:32.193 --> 1:31:32.793
What?

1:31:32.827 --> 1:31:34.128
What kind of plan is that?

1:31:34.161 --> 1:31:35.296
What kind of plan is that?

1:31:35.329 --> 1:31:36.297
Just trust me on this.

1:31:36.330 --> 1:31:38.532
Push him as hard as you
can without passing him.

1:31:40.001 --> 1:31:40.935
Richard
Hurt in front,

1:31:40.968 --> 1:31:43.237
but Billy Burnett is
rapidly closing the gap!

1:31:47.274 --> 1:31:49.010
Burnett takes the inside line!

1:31:51.045 --> 1:31:52.313
He tries again!

1:31:52.346 --> 1:31:53.981
They're side by side!

1:31:54.015 --> 1:31:55.683
The crowd is going crazy!

1:31:58.119 --> 1:31:59.987
Richard Hurt is doing
everything he can

1:32:00.021 --> 1:32:01.122
to hold onto his lead,

1:32:01.155 --> 1:32:03.958
but Burnett is on him like
a dog on a piece of meat.

1:32:06.961 --> 1:32:07.995
Richard, be smart.

1:32:08.029 --> 1:32:09.597
You don't need to win this.

1:32:09.630 --> 1:32:11.065
There's no
way he's beating me!

1:32:12.133 --> 1:32:13.901
The
white flag comes out.

1:32:13.934 --> 1:32:15.770
One lap to go!

1:32:15.803 --> 1:32:16.737
Come on.

1:32:16.771 --> 1:32:19.006
Burn, you son of a gun, burn.

1:32:24.078 --> 1:32:28.015
All right, Billy,
take us home.

1:32:28.049 --> 1:32:29.717
Burnett sets him up.

1:32:29.750 --> 1:32:30.718
He dives inside,

1:32:30.751 --> 1:32:32.720
trying to get the drive
down the backstretch.

1:32:32.753 --> 1:32:34.155
And Burnett goes by!

1:32:34.188 --> 1:32:35.756
Richard Hurt is slowing.

1:32:35.790 --> 1:32:36.791
He's got a problem.

1:32:36.824 --> 1:32:37.792
His ski has died.

1:32:37.825 --> 1:32:38.959
Hurt is down!

1:32:38.993 --> 1:32:41.996
Hurt is down!

1:32:43.064 --> 1:32:45.166
Billy
Burnett is going to do it.

1:32:45.199 --> 1:32:47.701
From dead last to first,

1:32:47.735 --> 1:32:50.037
what an amazing ride
for this young man.

1:32:50.071 --> 1:32:53.040
Here it is, the checkered flag!

1:32:53.074 --> 1:32:55.709
Billy Burnett has overcome
an incredible setback

1:32:55.743 --> 1:32:57.812
on the start and done it.

1:32:57.845 --> 1:32:58.879
He has won the battle,

1:32:58.913 --> 1:33:01.649
but it looks like Richard
Hurt will win the war.

1:33:01.682 --> 1:33:04.085
He's up and running and
going to nurse it home

1:33:04.118 --> 1:33:05.886
for at least a
10th place finish.

1:33:07.021 --> 1:33:09.156
Whoa, what's that all about?

1:33:09.190 --> 1:33:10.891
If Richard finishes
in the top 10,

1:33:10.925 --> 1:33:12.026
he wins the championship.

1:33:12.059 --> 1:33:13.861
What's that?
What's that? What?

1:33:15.930 --> 1:33:17.031
I'm gonna go
grab the ski, okay?

1:33:18.299 --> 1:33:21.068
Hurt's ski dies
again and he drops to fourth.

1:33:22.136 --> 1:33:25.673
He gets it re-lit, but it's
not firing on all cylinders.

1:33:25.706 --> 1:33:28.109
Two more riders go by,
dropping Hurt to sixth,

1:33:28.142 --> 1:33:29.944
and the crowd has
picked up on it,

1:33:29.977 --> 1:33:31.812
as he continues
to drop positions.

1:33:32.746 --> 1:33:33.747
Seventh!

1:33:36.884 --> 1:33:38.352
Hurt is limping
toward the finish line

1:33:38.385 --> 1:33:40.821
30 feet away and
his ski dies again!

1:33:40.855 --> 1:33:41.523
He's down!

1:33:41.556 --> 1:33:43.157
He's down in the water again!

1:33:43.190 --> 1:33:44.758
Here comes another rider.

1:33:45.926 --> 1:33:46.861
Eighth!

1:33:46.894 --> 1:33:49.029
Hurt's
ski is completely dead.

1:33:49.063 --> 1:33:51.932
He's trying to swim it
across the finish line.

1:33:51.966 --> 1:33:54.034
He looks back, and here
comes another rider.

1:33:54.068 --> 1:33:56.070
He'll drop down to ninth.

1:33:56.103 --> 1:33:57.304
Ninth!

1:33:57.338 --> 1:34:00.174
Hurt is a mere
20 feet from the finish line.

1:34:00.207 --> 1:34:01.108
Here comes another rider

1:34:01.142 --> 1:34:03.911
putting him on the
bubble in 10th place.

1:34:03.944 --> 1:34:04.945
10th!

1:34:04.979 --> 1:34:05.946
He
could lose it all!

1:34:07.014 --> 1:34:08.015
Hurt looks exhausted.

1:34:08.048 --> 1:34:09.116
Here comes another rider,

1:34:09.150 --> 1:34:11.919
and it's his
teammate Kelly Weber!

1:34:11.952 --> 1:34:13.954
Kelly, do
not pass Richard!

1:34:13.988 --> 1:34:15.389
Do you understand?

1:34:15.422 --> 1:34:16.724
Do not pass Richard!

1:34:17.925 --> 1:34:20.161
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no...

1:34:21.328 --> 1:34:24.031
Kelly
Weber is slowing down.

1:34:24.064 --> 1:34:26.066
She's stopping
behind Richard Hurt.

1:34:26.100 --> 1:34:29.737
And look at this, there's no
one else left on the course!

1:34:29.770 --> 1:34:31.839
Richard Hurt is gonna
win the championship

1:34:31.872 --> 1:34:33.407
by the skin of his teeth.

1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:35.809
Billy Burnett rode the
race of a lifetime,

1:34:35.843 --> 1:34:38.712
but the championship wasn't
in the cards for him today.

1:34:38.746 --> 1:34:39.380
That's perfect, Kelly.

1:34:39.413 --> 1:34:40.981
Great job. Just sit tight.

1:34:44.051 --> 1:34:45.085
Come on, Kelly.

1:34:45.119 --> 1:34:45.953
Come on, come on, come on.

1:34:49.223 --> 1:34:51.225
Richard
Hurt is just 15 feet

1:34:51.258 --> 1:34:52.793
away from victory!

1:34:52.826 --> 1:34:54.895
Kelly, great
teamwork out there.

1:34:54.929 --> 1:34:55.829
Do you read me?

1:34:56.531 --> 1:34:58.365
Kelly, do you read me?

1:34:58.399 --> 1:34:59.233
Kelly?

1:35:03.337 --> 1:35:03.971
Come on, Kelly.

1:35:06.073 --> 1:35:07.174
You know what to do. Come on.

1:35:10.077 --> 1:35:11.745
Come on.

1:35:11.779 --> 1:35:13.781
Do it for love, baby.

1:35:13.814 --> 1:35:15.482
Richard
Hurt is just 10 feet away

1:35:15.517 --> 1:35:17.084
from making history.

1:35:17.117 --> 1:35:18.852
Kelly, using team strategy

1:35:18.886 --> 1:35:21.855
to allow Richard Hurt to
take home the championship.

1:35:21.889 --> 1:35:23.791
But wait, Kelly
Weber goes for it!

1:35:23.824 --> 1:35:25.759
She drops Richard
Hurt to 11th place!

1:35:25.793 --> 1:35:26.994
I don't believe this!

1:35:27.027 --> 1:35:28.829
11th, yeah!

1:35:28.862 --> 1:35:30.297
Billy Burnett
wins the championship!

1:35:30.331 --> 1:35:31.799
He wins the championship!

1:35:46.013 --> 1:35:48.082
I guess I do have a
thing for champions.

1:36:00.494 --> 1:36:01.462
You did it!

1:36:02.997 --> 1:36:04.098
This is my son!

1:36:04.131 --> 1:36:06.967
This is my son!

1:36:33.093 --> 1:36:34.061
This is your son.

1:36:38.232 --> 1:36:39.933
I'm so proud of you, man.

1:36:39.967 --> 1:36:41.569
Coach come here, man.

1:36:41.603 --> 1:36:42.436
Come here.

1:36:44.572 --> 1:36:48.876
Team Burnett, baby! Team
Burnett! Team Burnett!

1:36:48.909 --> 1:36:49.544
Woo!

1:36:51.312 --> 1:36:53.347
Don't think you're getting
out of here unscathed.

1:36:53.380 --> 1:36:55.449
Come on, what did I do now?

1:36:55.482 --> 1:36:58.052
I hear you're the
reason got Billy here.

1:36:58.085 --> 1:36:59.453
You done good.

1:36:59.486 --> 1:37:00.888
No, you're nuts.

1:37:00.921 --> 1:37:02.056
I'm not falling for
whatever you're up to.

1:37:02.089 --> 1:37:03.257
You need help.

1:37:03.290 --> 1:37:04.892
You're the one
that's gonna need help.

1:37:08.028 --> 1:37:09.163
Yeah?

1:37:09.196 --> 1:37:10.030
Yeah.

1:37:14.101 --> 1:37:16.070
Sam, take a look at this.

1:37:16.103 --> 1:37:17.037
She was taking pictures

1:37:17.071 --> 1:37:19.039
during the starting
line National Anthem.

1:37:19.073 --> 1:37:21.141
Looks like Richard was
a little distracted.

1:37:21.175 --> 1:37:22.876
Are you kidding me?

1:37:22.910 --> 1:37:24.044
Seriously, Richard?

1:37:24.078 --> 1:37:25.446
You're suspending for a year.

1:37:26.313 --> 1:37:27.314
This is Broward Motorsports.

1:37:27.348 --> 1:37:28.382
We don't cheat.

1:37:28.415 --> 1:37:30.217
You're fired, go find
yourself another sponsor.

1:38:16.063 --> 1:38:19.032
Ready or not, here I come.

1:38:21.068 --> 1:38:22.002
Are you ready for me?

1:38:48.996 --> 1:38:50.097
Jarid,
do you have the line,

1:38:50.130 --> 1:38:51.098
or do you want me to feed you?

1:38:51.131 --> 1:38:52.132
I got this.

1:38:52.166 --> 1:38:52.966
All right.

1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:53.868
Shoot.

1:38:53.902 --> 1:38:54.869
That's
what I like to hear.

1:38:54.903 --> 1:38:57.971
- And action.
- All right, be heads up now.

1:38:58.005 --> 1:39:00.007
Jarid's gonna be out for blood.

1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:01.341
Show 'em your ass.

1:39:01.375 --> 1:39:02.577
Richard's
gonna be out for blood.

1:39:02.610 --> 1:39:04.378
- Yep, not me.
- Not you.

1:39:05.613 --> 1:39:09.483
See, I got this.

1:39:11.753 --> 1:39:12.986
How are we looking?

1:39:13.020 --> 1:39:14.121
Well, Richard's slowing down.

1:39:14.154 --> 1:39:15.523
He's probably saving his motor.

1:39:17.057 --> 1:39:18.091
Shit.

1:39:19.059 --> 1:39:20.327
You want to try that again?

1:39:22.262 --> 1:39:22.897
Sorry.

1:39:24.732 --> 1:39:25.999
Did you want to say something?

1:39:27.802 --> 1:39:31.071
Hey Billy, what'd you
want from Burger King?

1:39:31.104 --> 1:39:33.006
All right, so listen, I
tried that five play thing

1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:34.441
and I can't quite get the thumb.

1:39:34.475 --> 1:39:36.043
- I need something.
- Dog, dog...

1:39:36.076 --> 1:39:37.110
Give me something.

1:39:37.144 --> 1:39:39.079
Dog, you're not supposed
to try it on yourself.

1:39:39.112 --> 1:39:40.013
Oh, okay.

1:39:40.047 --> 1:39:40.782
You're supposed to
meet a woman first.

1:39:40.815 --> 1:39:41.583
Very funny.

1:39:42.416 --> 1:39:44.251
Hey, I tell you
a secret, okay?

1:39:44.284 --> 1:39:45.787
Do not tell anyone.

1:39:45.820 --> 1:39:46.654
All right.

1:39:48.121 --> 1:39:49.022
I'm not French.

1:39:51.158 --> 1:39:53.026
Wait, wait, wait.

1:39:53.060 --> 1:39:54.094
Are you serious?

1:39:54.127 --> 1:39:56.029
Maybe.

1:39:57.297 --> 1:40:00.467
Maybe not.

1:40:01.769 --> 1:40:03.203
Son of a bitch!
