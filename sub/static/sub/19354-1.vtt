* Bleeds
[chattering, shouting]

00:50.784 --> 00:55.323
* But it bleeds
although you block it *

00:55.356 --> 00:57.625
* But it bleeds.

00:57.658 --> 01:01.229
Oh, get it together, Becca!

01:01.262 --> 01:03.597
You gotta help me, please!
I'm sorry.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.267
I'll do anything you want!
Just tell him to stop!

01:06.300 --> 01:08.602
- I want it to be over.
- Let go of me!

01:08.636 --> 01:09.637
[rumbling]

01:09.670 --> 01:11.372
Please, please!
Help me!

01:11.405 --> 01:12.706
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.108
Come on!

01:14.142 --> 01:15.809
[rumbling]

01:22.316 --> 01:25.419
- It's getting worse!
- What's going on?

01:25.453 --> 01:27.421
Hey, are we having
an earthquake?

01:27.455 --> 01:28.556
What are you
talking about, dude?

01:28.589 --> 01:31.159
- You don't feel that?
- Feel what?

01:33.694 --> 01:36.797
- Becca! What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:36.830 --> 01:41.869
No! No! No!

01:41.902 --> 01:44.104
Look!

02:05.659 --> 02:08.929
Save Hennessey Hall!
Save Hennessey Hall!

02:08.961 --> 02:10.663
[chanting continues]

02:21.875 --> 02:23.577
[grunts]

02:25.279 --> 02:26.714
What are you doing?

02:26.747 --> 02:28.382
Get out of the way!
It's coming back down!

02:28.416 --> 02:31.319
What are you doing?
It's coming back down!

02:34.322 --> 02:37.191
Are you insane?
You almost just got killed.

02:37.225 --> 02:37.658
Bummer.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.293
- Pizza?
- Okay.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.628
What is wrong
with you people?

02:40.661 --> 02:41.562
Hey, don't sweat it.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.497
There's plenty of things
to do around here.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.539
[birds chirping]

02:57.378 --> 03:00.781
* I don't know
what's in my head *

03:00.814 --> 03:03.817
* What I feel,
what I see *

03:03.851 --> 03:05.819
Hey, Max!

03:05.853 --> 03:08.188
I just got in the new shirts.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.793
What?

03:12.826 --> 03:15.829
What do you mean,
somebody cut you out?

03:15.863 --> 03:17.931
That's impossible.

03:24.672 --> 03:28.742
* Oh, singularity

03:28.776 --> 03:32.880
* It's happening to me.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.582
Hey, hey!

03:34.615 --> 03:35.849
Where did you get
that shirt?

03:35.883 --> 03:38.819
Where did you get it?

03:38.852 --> 03:41.655
Hey, excuse me. Listen,
where did you get that?

03:44.625 --> 03:47.361
Hi, hi. Excuse me.
Where did you buy that shirt?

03:47.395 --> 03:48.562
It's pretty awesome, huh?

03:48.596 --> 03:50.364
Yeah, but where
did you get it?

03:50.398 --> 03:53.501
Some guy was selling them
at the student union.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.005
You've seen 'em, you want 'em,
I got 'em.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.941
$20 bucks a pop.
Let's get the money out.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.313
Here you go...
Hey!

04:05.346 --> 04:06.747
- Where did you get these?
- Back off, man.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.483
- Yo!
- I'm taking what's mine.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.285
- I'm calling Security!
- Yeah? You do that.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.520
Then maybe you can explain
to them

04:12.553 --> 04:13.921
why you're selling
stolen property!

04:13.954 --> 04:15.389
Whoa. I don't know
anything about that!

04:15.423 --> 04:17.558
Who gave theses to you?
Who?

04:17.591 --> 04:20.060
Some guy who said that,
if I helped sell the shirts,
he'd cut me in.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.495
Good.

04:21.529 --> 04:24.598
You can tell me
how I can contact him.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.335
Give me these.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.002
Yeah, Arun, listen.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.738
Somebody's stealing from us.
I need you to call the guy

04:30.771 --> 04:32.573
and set up a meeting.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.908
I don't know, Ari.
What if he finds out who I am?

04:34.942 --> 04:39.880
Arun, it's your artwork.
He's ripping you off, too!

04:39.913 --> 04:42.316
- Arun!
- Okay, okay.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.817
Listen, his name
is Elliott Carpenter.

04:43.851 --> 04:46.620
Call me when you set it up
and I'll meet you there.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.759
It doesn't even
look good on you!

04:51.792 --> 04:53.527
[pounding on door]

05:02.436 --> 05:06.574
How does it feel?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.075
[phone rings]

05:10.578 --> 05:13.347
Damn! Hey, Ari.

05:13.381 --> 05:15.082
Arun, everything set?

05:15.115 --> 05:16.950
Yeah, he should be
here in 30 minutes.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.719
What if he finds us out
and we lose 'em?

05:18.752 --> 05:21.054
Just get him to take you
to the merchandise.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.023
You call me and
I'll be there.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.025
You know, this affects
you too, Arun.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.494
[knocking on door]

05:26.527 --> 05:30.931
Oh, crap. He's early.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.634
David, aren't you
gonna let me in?

05:33.667 --> 05:38.005
Of course. Come in.

05:38.038 --> 05:41.875
So you're looking to buy.

05:41.909 --> 05:45.012
- Yeah.
- For yourself or resale?

05:45.045 --> 05:46.547
Resale.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.885
- So can I see the stuff?
- What stuff?

05:51.919 --> 05:53.887
The shirts.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.790
Yeah, I have to
be careful, David.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.726
You never know
who's a plant.

05:58.759 --> 06:02.630
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.797
I've never done this before.

06:03.831 --> 06:04.798
[pounding]

06:04.832 --> 06:06.434
What's that?

06:06.467 --> 06:08.001
Nothing.
It's just an unauthorized pet.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.603
You have to hide it.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.138
You never know
who's a plant, right?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.744
Let's get going.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.052
[pounding]

06:25.085 --> 06:27.521
Hey, I heard there's another
protest later tonight.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.958
- Is this the campus green?
- Yeah.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.726
It seems so different.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.061
Things are always
changing around here.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.564
Get used to it.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.131
Do you go to school here?

06:38.165 --> 06:41.068
Yeah. I figured out
a way to cheat.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.540
1616 Farragut.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.775
Don't move until
I get there!

06:47.808 --> 06:49.142
I might need your help.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.478
I think you're really
gonna love these.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.746
What?
Oh, the shirts.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.582
- Yeah, yeah, awesome.
- Are you okay?

06:54.615 --> 06:57.485
- Yeah, sure, yeah, totally.
- You seem a little anxious.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.019
No, no, no.
I'm good.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.522
You know what relaxes me
when I'm anxious, David?

07:01.555 --> 07:03.657
Hanging upside down.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.493
What is that?

07:05.526 --> 07:06.660
You're really
gonna like it.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.662
I mean, it really
calms the soul.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.831
No that we have one.
Try it out.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.900
Actually, I have
to get going.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.668
I insist.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.908
It's a real rush.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.043
Yeah, I don't really
like this.

07:23.076 --> 07:26.514
Yeah, well, you're gonna
have plenty of time
to get used to it.

07:28.248 --> 07:32.720
- Ari! Help!
- I'm gonna kill you!

07:32.753 --> 07:34.054
Come on!
We can work something out!

07:34.087 --> 07:35.222
How about 50-50?

07:35.255 --> 07:37.591
50-50?
It's my stuff!

07:38.592 --> 07:39.927
How about 60-40?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.829
I mean, you gotta work
with me here, you know?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.469
Ari? Come back!
Ari!

07:52.906 --> 07:54.508
Who the hell do you
think you are?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.744
Just a guy playing along
like everyone else.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.646
- Not by the rules!
- Rules.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.148
You know, that's the problem
with this place!

08:01.181 --> 08:02.816
There's too many rules!

08:02.850 --> 08:05.018
But you're not
supposed to do this!

08:16.263 --> 08:18.065
[grunts]

08:23.036 --> 08:24.037
Tough spot!

08:24.071 --> 08:26.540
Help me up!

08:26.574 --> 08:28.508
I only help my partners.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.047
Oh, my God!

08:34.081 --> 08:36.116
Oh, my God!

08:36.149 --> 08:38.818
I need help!
Somebody help me!

08:41.889 --> 08:46.994
Oh, no.
He's not breathing!

08:47.027 --> 08:49.262
Someone call 9-1-1!

08:49.296 --> 08:52.600
What is wrong with you!
He needs help!

08:52.633 --> 08:55.068
Call 9-1-1!

08:57.004 --> 08:59.773
Why won't
anybody help me?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.915
Don't move.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.116
Why not?

09:09.149 --> 09:13.220
Why not? You just fell
like 13 stories.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.756
But I'm okay.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.758
How can you be okay?

09:19.727 --> 09:20.961
I feel okay.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.965
You're not bleeding.

09:30.838 --> 09:33.874
Everything looks so strange.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.643
What do you mean?

09:35.676 --> 09:38.812
I mean, I know this place.
I've been here before.

09:38.846 --> 09:44.184
But it just...
it looks different, you know?

09:45.252 --> 09:48.756
Yeah, actually I do.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.992
You need to go
to the hospital.

09:52.025 --> 09:55.062
No, no, I don't think
that's necessary.

09:55.095 --> 09:59.099
I don't care what you think.
You're coming with me.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.849
Well, everything
checks out all right.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.819
But I saw him
fall 13 stories.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.421
But everything
checks out all right.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.823
Everything checks out
all right.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.191
But that's impossible.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.728
I saw him fall from
the top of a building.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.329
Have a nice day.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.164
Have a nice day.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.834
But, I...

10:33.867 --> 10:35.903
Have a good day.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.245
It's empty.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.917
Well, that's weird.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.051
That's weird?

10:54.254 --> 10:56.223
Hey, what's your name?

10:56.256 --> 10:57.290
Becca.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.192
Well, thank you, Becca.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.461
Yeah, no problem.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.364
Listen, if you're free, maybe
we could grab dinner some... ow!

11:04.397 --> 11:05.733
What? Are you insane?

11:05.766 --> 11:07.735
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah, it hurts!

11:07.768 --> 11:09.069
You just stabbed me
in the hand!

11:09.102 --> 11:10.871
How do you
explain that then?

11:12.806 --> 11:17.377
Maybe we can see
another doctor.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.446
No. I don't need
another doctor.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.983
What I need is to find the guy
who's stealing my business away.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.852
No, you can't just leave.
We have to figure this out.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.253
Stay away from me.

11:28.388 --> 11:32.225
Look, I'm in Weinstein 350
if you change your mind.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.367
[grunting]

11:40.400 --> 11:44.237
Hello?
Is anyone there?

11:54.114 --> 11:55.715
[pounding]

11:56.950 --> 12:00.020
Dude, shut...

12:00.053 --> 12:02.055
Interesting skeletons
you keep in there.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.757
Give it back.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.426
Come get it.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.362
What do you want from me?

12:09.396 --> 12:12.465
Well, you put me in
a tough spot.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.468
So to make it up to me,
I want you to join

12:15.502 --> 12:17.771
a worthy cause that'll
help me get out of it.

12:17.805 --> 12:20.841
No. I won't do it.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.843
Yes, you will.

12:22.876 --> 12:27.014
- I'll just...
- What? Erase them?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.049
Not while they're
locked in, dummy.

12:30.483 --> 12:35.022
1060 Norman Avenue.
You have until four.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.475
Can I help you?

12:55.508 --> 12:59.847
Is this Room 318,
Weinstein 318?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.982
Oh, Weinstein's
across the green.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.885
- This is Mendon Hall.
- I'm such an idiot.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.220
I'm sorry for bothering you.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.956
That's okay.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.291
What's that?

13:11.324 --> 13:13.293
A painting.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.329
You paint?
I didn't know that.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.298
Why would you?

13:18.331 --> 13:23.170
Right, of course.
I'm not making any sense today.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.537
Look, I'm late
for my opening,

13:24.571 --> 13:26.273
but if you want,
I'll be passing Weinstein.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.975
I can show you where it is.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.376
That'd be really nice, Arun.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.411
How do you know my name?

13:31.444 --> 13:32.846
I read it.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.416
Yeah.

13:47.527 --> 13:51.865
You look like you just
been through a carwash
without the car.

13:51.899 --> 13:55.535
Yeah, I've had better days.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.270
Damn it!
This looks terrible!

13:57.304 --> 14:01.374
Izzy, something really
weird is happening here.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.243
I can't do this.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.078
Whoa, what's wrong, Iz?

14:05.112 --> 14:09.582
I...

14:09.616 --> 14:12.119
I just wish I'd brought
that other dress!

14:12.152 --> 14:15.488
I just saw a man fall
from the top of a building
and not get hurt.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.623
What do you think
about this one?

14:16.656 --> 14:18.892
Who cares about your dress?

14:18.926 --> 14:20.327
Did you even hear
what I just said?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.394
I care!

14:21.428 --> 14:23.130
I have to make sure everything
is perfect tonight

14:23.163 --> 14:25.265
or this is gonna be
the shortest date in history!

14:25.298 --> 14:30.103
He fell 13 stories and
just got up and walked away.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.508
What is wrong with everybody?

14:51.324 --> 14:54.227
[sighs]

14:54.261 --> 14:58.031
- Uh, when did you start?
- I just signed up today.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.200
Any recommendations on what
I should do first?

15:00.233 --> 15:03.103
Uh, whatever
you like, really.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.671
I sculpt.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.040
- You do?
- Since I was 12.

15:07.074 --> 15:11.444
But I don't think
I'm good enough to get
into a show like you.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.380
You just need
to get people to like you.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.715
Well, then I guess you
must have a lot of talent.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.118
Uh, I don't really know.

15:18.151 --> 15:21.321
It's just sort of in comparison
to everyone else here.

15:23.556 --> 15:27.327
So what do your
parents think...

15:27.360 --> 15:29.296
about your sculpting,
I mean?

15:29.329 --> 15:32.232
They don't know
anything about it.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.466
They think
I'm going to class.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.068
Whoa.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.070
There's just
something inside

15:37.104 --> 15:38.405
you can't let
anyone stop, you know.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.341
Yeah.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.610
Hey, why don't you come
to my art opening tonight?

15:43.643 --> 15:46.379
Sure, I'd love to come.

15:46.413 --> 15:50.317
Hi, there.
Love to come where?

15:50.350 --> 15:52.285
- Who is this?
- Um...

15:52.319 --> 15:57.057
- I'm Greta.
- Izzy, Greta.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.458
And who's Greta?

15:58.491 --> 16:00.193
I was just
helping her find...

16:00.227 --> 16:03.530
- My room.
- Oh, your room, really?

16:03.563 --> 16:07.167
- He was just being a gentleman.
- Well, he is that.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.236
That's why he invited me
to his art opening.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.439
Oh, is this before or after
he helps you find your room?

16:12.472 --> 16:16.343
Look, I'll see you
at the exhibit, okay?

16:16.376 --> 16:18.245
It was nice meeting you, Izzy.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.582
I got to drop this off.
Do you wanna come with me?

16:25.185 --> 16:26.719
Of course.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.590
You know, I looked for you
last night.

16:30.623 --> 16:33.460
It didn't come in.
I had to do something.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.396
Yeah, real life
interferes sometimes.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.235
You know, that girl,
it was just nothing.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.304
I'm not upset.

16:44.337 --> 16:48.175
I just got a little jealous.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.711
Jealous?
Why would you get jealous?

16:51.744 --> 16:54.814
It's just I've imagined
strolling out

16:54.847 --> 16:56.483
in the open like this
for a long time.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.219
I don't wanna lose that.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.654
Were your past boyfriends
vampires or something?

17:01.688 --> 17:05.692
Let's just say they
wouldn't be seen in
the light of day with me.

17:05.724 --> 17:08.395
What?

17:08.428 --> 17:11.664
Do you have some sort of
deformity I don't know about?

17:11.698 --> 17:14.501
Sometimes people are
just afraid to let you be
who you are.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.669
Yeah, like parents.

17:20.740 --> 17:24.611
What?
What's wrong?

17:24.644 --> 17:26.546
I just wish...

17:26.579 --> 17:27.780
Wish what?

17:27.814 --> 17:30.350
- Nothing.
- Support the cause!

17:30.383 --> 17:31.851
No limitations!
No restrictions!

17:31.884 --> 17:33.386
No administrators!

17:33.420 --> 17:34.687
That's right!
Sign the petition!

17:34.721 --> 17:37.290
Don't be a hater.
Don't be...

17:37.324 --> 17:38.358
Jerk-off!

17:38.391 --> 17:39.692
We paid for this place!

17:39.726 --> 17:42.395
We should be able to do
what we want, right?

17:42.429 --> 17:44.431
Isn't that right?

17:44.464 --> 17:45.698
Isn't that right?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.800
- Come on, Arun.
- Isn't that right?

17:47.834 --> 17:49.369
Get away from us!

17:49.402 --> 17:51.538
He doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.577
- What was that about?
- I have to pop out.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.212
I forgot I had
to do something.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.613
I'll see you later at
your opening, okay?

18:00.647 --> 18:02.449
Okay, no problem.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.783
Okay.

18:16.629 --> 18:20.767
Hi. Do you have any books on
people who survive major trauma?

18:20.800 --> 18:23.570
Like big falls or something?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.238
Niagara Falls, aisle 2.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.641
No, like people
who fall from buildings.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.411
Buildings,
aisle 16.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.413
[sighs]

18:59.306 --> 19:01.241
Am I losing it?

19:02.775 --> 19:06.813
Well, whatever you lost,
maybe I can help you find?

19:06.846 --> 19:11.318
Better yet, maybe we could
find something new!

19:11.351 --> 19:13.553
Oh! Get away from me!

19:13.586 --> 19:14.787
Come on,
let's have some fun!

19:14.821 --> 19:16.323
Isn't that why
we're all here?

19:16.356 --> 19:17.457
[grunts]

19:22.895 --> 19:24.397
Excuse me.
You gotta help me.

19:24.431 --> 19:28.801
This guy is chasing me
and... excuse me?

19:49.989 --> 19:51.524
Tight squeeze.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.393
Oh, loosen up.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.994
That kind of behavior
isn't allowed here.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.996
Next time,
you'll be kicked out.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.532
Guys, we were
just playing around.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.806
What, you're just
gonna let him go?

20:57.624 --> 21:00.427
David?
Come on in.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.863
- This the guy?
- This is him.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.398
Great.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.000
Elliott tells me
you're here to join.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.936
Dude, I'm not your guy.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.639
- Look, David...
- Arun?

21:12.672 --> 21:14.341
Jennifer?

21:14.374 --> 21:17.043
No, I knew you didn't
really look like a David.

21:17.076 --> 21:20.880
Well, look at that.
Isn't that ironic?

21:20.913 --> 21:22.782
What is he doing here?

21:22.815 --> 21:24.817
You didn't say
anything to him?

21:24.851 --> 21:26.719
Say something to me?

21:26.753 --> 21:29.422
Now why would I do that?

21:29.456 --> 21:32.024
But it is good to have
a face just in case

21:32.058 --> 21:35.462
you don't come
through for me.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.996
And I will tell him.

21:37.029 --> 21:40.700
- You guys totally lost me.
- She's one of us, Arun.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.569
What do you want with me?

21:42.602 --> 21:44.103
To sign a piece of paper
saying you'll join our cause.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.772
Why?

21:45.805 --> 21:48.908
We only three more signatures
and this place is ours.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.076
I like it how it is.

21:54.581 --> 21:55.815
Just sign it

21:55.848 --> 21:58.451
and you'll never
hear from us again.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.791
Okay, fine, I'll join.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.761
You won't be sorry.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.917
What did you tell him?

22:30.950 --> 22:32.619
Nothing yet.

22:32.652 --> 22:35.388
- Unless I join you.
- Precisely.

22:35.422 --> 22:38.725
Why me?
Why now?

22:38.758 --> 22:40.760
The situation has changed.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.395
We're almost there

22:42.429 --> 22:46.566
but the pickings are
getting increasingly thin.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.701
In short, we need you.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.071
Get her away from me.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.640
Trust me, Iz.
This is for the best.

22:53.673 --> 22:54.974
You know, I knew
you were selfish.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.743
But I didn't think you
could be cruel.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.845
Right now, I'm about
to get kicked out of here.

22:58.878 --> 22:59.946
Good.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.782
I blew all my allowance
money on this stupid place.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.151
But it's gonna rock once
these guys take over.

23:05.184 --> 23:09.088
Go away.
I hate you.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.491
Jennifer sees
the big picture.

23:11.524 --> 23:14.627
She gets it.

23:14.661 --> 23:18.197
It's time for you
to get with it, too.

23:18.230 --> 23:25.071
If you think you can scare me
into joining, you're wrong.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.575
You know, you could have
made yourself look better.

23:32.479 --> 23:34.881
So you'll be the one
to tell him then?

23:41.854 --> 23:43.656
Maybe I'll take my chances.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.559
Good luck.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.795
We're not the bad guys.

23:48.828 --> 23:52.999
So when you take over,
how can I trust that
you're gonna keep quiet?

23:53.032 --> 23:55.768
See, that's the beauty
of when we take over.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.870
Everyone's business
will be their own.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.772
I don't believe you.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.174
Well, you'll
just have to trust me.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.511
Or tell him yourself.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.645
Maybe I'll do that!

24:05.678 --> 24:07.514
You are really
pissing me off.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.949
You have until
midnight to sign on

24:09.982 --> 24:11.984
or I'm telling him.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.152
Give me the day
to think about it.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.854
- You have until midnight!
- What?

24:14.887 --> 24:20.893
They are all over us!
There isn't much time!

24:20.927 --> 24:23.129
Midnight.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.236
One more.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.706
It had to be done.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.174
You really mean that?

24:35.207 --> 24:37.510
About everyone's business
being their own?

24:37.544 --> 24:40.146
Freaks like Izzy won't
be around to find out.

24:40.179 --> 24:43.616
* This ain't no time
to celebrate *

24:45.217 --> 24:47.153
* For being
a part of the scene *

24:47.186 --> 24:50.757
* It's time to tweak
and not fixate *

24:50.790 --> 24:52.191
Another!

24:52.224 --> 24:53.660
You already
exceeded your limit.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.562
Can I interest you in
a cup of coffee?

24:55.595 --> 24:59.065
I wanna drink till I'm lying
face down in my own vomit.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.133
You've already
exceeded your limit.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.935
Enough.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.671
How about a cup of coffee?

25:04.704 --> 25:05.705
You moron!

25:05.738 --> 25:07.607
What I need is another...

25:09.976 --> 25:11.043
Never mind.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.713
Coffee?

25:13.746 --> 25:16.082
Hey, cool if
I buy you a drink?

25:16.115 --> 25:18.751
Really?
Are you gonna do this?

25:18.785 --> 25:22.021
- We're just having fun.
- Yeah, I know it's fun now.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.923
What if it gets serious?

25:23.956 --> 25:25.958
You guys don't even
know each other.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.760
What's your problem?

25:27.794 --> 25:29.662
I'm just trying to save
you from some heartache.

25:29.696 --> 25:30.997
Be miserable
in your own life.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.765
Don't bring it here.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.840
Arun, what am
I doing to you?

25:43.943 --> 25:49.115
* This darkened heart
and darkened mind *

25:49.148 --> 25:53.853
* Are in a part of me that's
proving hard to find *

25:53.886 --> 25:56.689
I think I like
that one best.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.191
Really?
You think it's good?

25:59.225 --> 26:01.961
Mm-hmm. I totally feel
that way sometimes.

26:01.994 --> 26:07.199
So your parents want you
to be a doctor, huh?

26:07.233 --> 26:09.235
You don't even know
the half of it.

26:09.268 --> 26:12.939
They have me set up
to marry some girl that
I don't even know.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.206
An arranged marriage?

26:14.240 --> 26:15.775
It's so unfair.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.209
I mean, I've never
even met this girl.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.278
How can you love someone
you've never met?

26:19.311 --> 26:22.081
You can't.

26:22.114 --> 26:25.952
I just imagine her to be this
cow with like three heads

26:25.985 --> 26:27.954
and all these boils.

26:27.987 --> 26:31.090
Well, I can assure
you she's definitely not.

26:31.123 --> 26:34.226
I mean, you know,
you can't think that way.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.862
You be positive.

26:35.895 --> 26:39.398
My parents actually
have me arranged, too.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.868
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

26:41.901 --> 26:46.272
Look, I have a confession.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.241
Yeah?

26:49.275 --> 26:52.845
I saw you today
at the Griefers.

26:52.879 --> 26:55.347
I followed you.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.149
Look, you were acting
really strange.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.985
And I was worried.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.286
I thought I would just check.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.021
And make sure
everything's okay.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.323
I mean, that's probably
why Izzy was there, too.

27:04.356 --> 27:08.761
Izzy? That's why she
left so abruptly.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.397
She wasn't following me.
She was on her way there.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.866
Where is she anyway?
I need to call her.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.968
No, no. You need to
calm down first, okay?

27:16.002 --> 27:17.837
Just think it through.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.973
I'm sure there's a really
good explanation for it.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.175
Maybe.

27:23.209 --> 27:27.780
Being here sometimes
feels like an arranged
marriage, right?

27:27.814 --> 27:31.150
You don't really always know
who the other person is.

27:31.183 --> 27:32.985
Arun, Arun,
I need to talk to you.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.053
All right, just
give me a little...

27:34.086 --> 27:35.121
I really need
to talk to you.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.789
- I'm busy...
- Now!

27:36.823 --> 27:38.290
It's okay.
I'll see you later, okay?

27:39.391 --> 27:41.360
[phone rings]

27:47.266 --> 27:48.701
- Hello?
- Arun?

27:48.735 --> 27:52.204
Yes? This is me, Arun.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.406
I need to see you tonight.
It's really important.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.877
Okay.
How about Campus Tap Room?

27:57.910 --> 28:01.781
- 5 p.m.?
- Campus Tap Room.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.051
Look, I cannot
find Elliott anywhere.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.286
- Have you seen him?
- No, I haven't.

28:07.319 --> 28:08.320
Are you okay?

28:08.354 --> 28:10.857
I've had better days.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.192
Wonder what this place
is gonna be like after
they take over?

28:13.225 --> 28:15.361
Man, this guy's sick!

28:15.394 --> 28:17.864
Too bad he's a dot-head
or we'd keep him around.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.799
What did you just say?

28:19.832 --> 28:21.167
What do you care?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.468
- Come on, Ari, let's just...
- No, no.

28:22.501 --> 28:23.970
I care because he's my friend.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.938
Oh, isn't that cute?

28:25.972 --> 28:28.240
He standing up
for his boyfriend.

28:28.274 --> 28:29.809
Ari, it's not worth it!

28:29.842 --> 28:33.746
Look, I've had a
very, very rough day

28:33.780 --> 28:36.215
and I suggest that
you don't add to it.

28:36.248 --> 28:40.787
- We don't care.
- Not even a little.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.354
[grunting]

28:47.493 --> 28:49.228
Get him!

28:56.002 --> 28:57.303
[coughs]

29:02.141 --> 29:03.810
Woo!

29:05.377 --> 29:07.113
Woo!

29:07.146 --> 29:09.882
- Yeah, baby!
- Let's go.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.217
Woo!

29:16.455 --> 29:18.357
Ready for some coffee?

29:18.390 --> 29:20.392
What I need is another shot!

29:20.426 --> 29:23.362
You can have mine.
Shot, please?

29:23.395 --> 29:25.097
You got it, gorgeous.

29:25.131 --> 29:28.500
So what are we drinking to?

29:28.534 --> 29:30.369
Confusion.

29:30.402 --> 29:31.838
Here or at home?

29:31.871 --> 29:33.372
Both.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.507
Only, I never thought here
would be so complicated.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.576
I get that.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.312
You'd think that being
here would be a lot easier
than home life

29:40.346 --> 29:42.348
where not everyone's
so welcoming, you know.

29:42.381 --> 29:45.417
What are you up to?

29:45.451 --> 29:47.453
Just buying a
new friend a drink.

29:48.520 --> 29:52.024
Hey! Hey!
What did I say?

29:52.058 --> 29:53.960
You're done.
You're cut off!

29:53.993 --> 29:55.194
There's no more!
Finished!

29:55.227 --> 29:57.163
Finite!
Nada!

29:57.196 --> 29:58.965
The only thing you're gonna
get is coffee, or you leave.

29:58.998 --> 29:59.999
- What do you want?
- Fine. Coffee.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.467
Coffee.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.270
Please, handsome bartender,
can I have some coffee?

30:04.303 --> 30:06.973
See?
Was that hard?

30:07.006 --> 30:08.274
No, that's not hard.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.341
You want another shot?

30:09.375 --> 30:11.610
- Mm-hmm.
- Hoo-hoo-hoo.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.881
So what's your story?

30:14.914 --> 30:18.517
Nothing exciting really.
I just joined.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.519
Any particular reason?

30:20.552 --> 30:22.188
Guys?

30:22.221 --> 30:25.992
Well, there are a lot
of great guys here.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.560
Other great guys.

30:28.594 --> 30:32.231
Please, he's crazy about you.
Anyone can see that.

30:32.264 --> 30:36.035
Anyway, it's actually a guy.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.904
We knew each other
as little kids

30:37.937 --> 30:40.206
and I heard he was here

30:40.239 --> 30:43.542
so I kind of hope to see how
the adult version turned out.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.211
Have you found him yet?

30:45.244 --> 30:48.180
So what about you?

30:48.214 --> 30:53.252
I have to ask, what's the deal
with you and the Griefers?

30:53.285 --> 30:55.021
What?

30:55.054 --> 30:56.522
I saw you when
you stopped by today.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.024
Oh, you're one of them, too?

30:58.057 --> 31:01.060
No, no, no.
I was hiding from them.

31:04.096 --> 31:08.935
They found out something
about me

31:08.968 --> 31:11.103
that I haven't
told Arun yet

31:11.137 --> 31:14.640
and they're holding it over
my head until I join them.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.375
Uh-oh.

31:16.408 --> 31:19.011
I totally didn't mean
for this to happen.

31:19.045 --> 31:22.348
I came here looking for a place
where I can just be myself

31:22.381 --> 31:24.250
without all the judgment,
you know?

31:24.283 --> 31:27.619
And then I met Arun.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.992
He's so sweet.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.627
I...

31:35.661 --> 31:37.663
I just don't want
to blow it.

31:37.696 --> 31:41.667
What could be so bad, though,
that you can't tell him?

31:41.700 --> 31:44.436
This happened once before.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.339
I can't talk about it.

31:47.373 --> 31:50.376
Look, I know where
you're coming from.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.611
In my house, feelings
are secondary.

31:52.644 --> 31:55.381
You're told what to do
and who to be with

31:55.414 --> 31:57.449
from almost
the minute that you're born.

31:57.483 --> 32:04.123
I would give anything
to share a secret with
someone that I love.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.458
Where do you think
it's gonna go, huh?

32:06.492 --> 32:08.527
- Outside?
- I don't know.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.463
Like I said, I never
intended for this to happen.

32:11.497 --> 32:14.166
Arun is such
an incredible person.

32:14.200 --> 32:19.471
He's so soft, so open.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.107
And so malleable.

32:23.175 --> 32:26.712
You know... sensitive.

32:26.745 --> 32:31.150
Guys where I'm from like
telling women what to do.

32:31.183 --> 32:34.286
That's not really my type.

32:34.320 --> 32:38.457
I made plans to see
him tonight and tell him.

32:38.490 --> 32:42.094
But I don't know,
I'm having second thoughts.

32:42.128 --> 32:45.331
If he loves you,
he'll accept it.

32:45.364 --> 32:49.968
And if not, who needs him?

32:51.570 --> 32:55.041
I thought you were
just a manipulative bitch.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.208
Ouch!

32:56.242 --> 32:57.376
[laughs]

32:57.409 --> 32:58.544
So why were you
at the Griefers?

32:58.577 --> 33:00.712
I was following Arun.

33:00.746 --> 33:02.648
Why was he
at the Griefers?

33:02.681 --> 33:05.151
They couldn't have told him.
They need me.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.519
Maybe you're not
the only one with a secret.

33:07.553 --> 33:10.789
* You're missing
all the clues *

33:10.822 --> 33:13.459
* You're missing
all the reasons *

33:13.492 --> 33:17.496
* You're missing
all the things right
in front of you *

33:17.529 --> 33:20.566
* The pieces that
tell the truth *

33:20.599 --> 33:26.672
* Then what's the use?
What are you needing? *

33:50.162 --> 33:51.763
What am I?

34:00.106 --> 34:02.174
Hey, gorgeous.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.375
You could use an upgrade.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.111
How did you get in here?

34:05.144 --> 34:08.179
You should keep
it locked to non-friends.

34:11.350 --> 34:12.851
Oh!

34:12.884 --> 34:14.186
Help!

34:14.219 --> 34:15.554
Why are you doing this to me?

34:15.587 --> 34:17.389
No more talking!

34:20.492 --> 34:22.628
Do you really need another
reason for me to kick your ass?

34:22.661 --> 34:23.795
Is that all you're gonna do?

34:23.829 --> 34:24.830
[grunts]

34:24.862 --> 34:26.297
- You okay?
- Yeah.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.481
[screams]

34:48.254 --> 34:49.255
Ari!

34:51.389 --> 34:53.458
Ari, I can't hold on!

34:53.492 --> 34:55.393
Ari!

35:00.532 --> 35:03.269
You're pulling me!
You're pulling us both down!

35:03.302 --> 35:04.736
- Jump!
- What?

35:04.770 --> 35:06.405
- Jump!
- What do you mean, jump?

35:06.438 --> 35:08.607
You've already
survived one fall!

35:08.640 --> 35:10.142
That's true.

35:10.176 --> 35:11.543
You want to test
if I can do it again?

35:11.577 --> 35:15.281
- We're both gonna fall!
- Bye, guys.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.648
Wait, wait, wait!
Pull me up!

35:16.682 --> 35:18.250
I'll give you what you want!
Anything!

35:18.284 --> 35:19.418
- I'll give you what you want!
- Really?

35:19.451 --> 35:20.586
Yes, please!
Just help me up!

35:20.619 --> 35:21.587
You know what?

35:21.620 --> 35:23.255
I think I'm just gonna
let him pull you down!

35:23.289 --> 35:24.790
- Let us up!
- No!

35:24.823 --> 35:27.159
Get off me!

35:27.193 --> 35:30.362
- Climb on me!
- Get off me!

35:30.396 --> 35:31.797
Never!

35:31.830 --> 35:33.399
Hurry!

35:38.270 --> 35:41.240
Grab the rail!
Grab the rail!

35:42.241 --> 35:43.842
Ari!

35:49.515 --> 35:52.584
Let's see what happens when
you go through the window!

35:52.618 --> 35:55.254
Go ahead.
That works just as well.

35:55.287 --> 35:56.455
[knocking on door]

35:56.488 --> 35:57.889
- Security!
- Coming!

35:57.923 --> 35:59.425
Stop!

35:59.458 --> 36:00.792
Tell them to go away,
and I'll stop.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.262
I want every penny back!

36:03.295 --> 36:05.397
He attacked me and all
you care about is money?

36:05.431 --> 36:06.632
Look, if she tells, you can
kiss your money goodbye!

36:06.665 --> 36:07.633
He's not gonna
bother you again.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.201
How do you know that?

36:09.235 --> 36:10.669
'Cause they'll be
too scared to.

36:10.702 --> 36:13.905
Yeah, well, she's not
really my type anyway.

36:30.489 --> 36:33.659
Well, that wasn't
the most elegant rescue.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.862
But thanks for
getting rid of him.

36:36.895 --> 36:40.366
Yeah, well, you're welcome.

36:40.399 --> 36:41.833
Why are you here?

36:41.867 --> 36:44.636
Listen, there's
something else.

36:46.405 --> 36:47.973
I got into this fight

36:48.006 --> 36:51.710
and I had a big piece
of glass

36:51.743 --> 36:53.712
sticking out of
the side of my head.

36:53.745 --> 36:59.851
And when I pulled it out,
there wasn't any blood.

36:59.885 --> 37:02.020
Not even a cut.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.023
And you wouldn't let go
to save me from falling?

37:05.056 --> 37:07.459
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:07.493 --> 37:09.495
Am I just supposed to assume
that I'm indestructible?

37:09.528 --> 37:11.297
What are you thinking?

37:11.330 --> 37:12.931
I think that you and Elliott
have something in common.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.967
Me and Elliott?

37:16.001 --> 37:18.970
What could we possibly
have in common?

37:20.038 --> 37:23.275
No blood.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.677
I don't understand.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.246
Before I fell out the window,
I stabbed Elliott with it.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.717
What are you?
What are you hiding?

37:31.750 --> 37:34.820
Hiding?
I'm not hiding anything!

37:34.853 --> 37:37.523
Listen, listen.
I just want what's mine.

37:37.556 --> 37:38.857
That's it.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.392
You're something else.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.428
Becca, I swear I know
just as much as you do.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.729
How do you know him?

37:43.762 --> 37:45.897
I found out that he was
ripping me off.

37:45.931 --> 37:48.300
I didn't even meet him
until today.

37:48.334 --> 37:52.003
This can't be a coincidence.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.740
Where are you from?

38:10.356 --> 38:11.690
I don't know.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.459
What do you mean,
you don't know?

38:13.492 --> 38:16.795
I mean, I can't remember.

38:16.828 --> 38:19.731
I can't remember
where I'm from.

38:19.765 --> 38:24.403
I can't remember anything
before being at this school.

38:24.436 --> 38:25.971
It's okay.

38:26.004 --> 38:29.375
Maybe the fall did
something to your memory.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.977
Let's go see if we can find
anything at student records.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.585
Excuse me?

38:39.618 --> 38:41.019
My friend would like to get
a look at his records.

38:43.555 --> 38:47.025
He would like to see
his records, please?

38:47.058 --> 38:50.128
You see that?
It's like I'm not even there.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.365
Hello?

38:53.399 --> 38:55.434
It's not just
you and Elliott.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.736
There's something wrong
with this whole place.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.605
Check the computer.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.846
Frozen.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.015
Yeah, this one too.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.650
Check the cabinets.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.121
Empty.

39:16.154 --> 39:18.624
- They're all empty.
- This doesn't make any sense.

39:18.657 --> 39:19.858
I know.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.493
I think Elliott knows
more than we do.

39:21.527 --> 39:23.061
I need to talk to him.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.763
No, Becca, that's
not a good idea.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.865
He has answers.
I'm sure of it.

39:38.644 --> 39:41.146
Hey, Ari blocked me
from accessing his stuff.

39:41.179 --> 39:42.414
- Good.
- It's your fault.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.015
It's my fault!

39:44.049 --> 39:45.517
You're the one who's
trying to steal from him!

39:45.551 --> 39:47.519
Yeah. Well, now you're
gonna help me.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.955
Look, those guys,
those psychos you made me

39:49.988 --> 39:52.157
join destroyed months and
months of my hard work.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.825
I'm through helping you.

39:53.859 --> 39:56.428
Hey, is that your
new friend over there?

39:56.462 --> 39:58.063
She's cute.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.831
Why don't we go
over together

39:59.865 --> 40:01.800
and we can give her
a tour of your room.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.569
That'd be fun.

40:03.602 --> 40:06.505
- What do you want from me?
- I want you go to Ari's

40:06.538 --> 40:07.839
and steal a bunch
of his new stuff.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.608
- No way.
- Yes way.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.478
Look, Ari is my friend
and we're business partners.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.079
Partners steal
from each other all the time.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.448
- It's no big deal.
- Yeah, if you're a thief.

40:16.482 --> 40:18.884
Okay, if I get caught,
I'll get kicked out of here.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.519
Possibly.

40:20.552 --> 40:23.655
The alternative, of course,
is you come clean

40:23.689 --> 40:26.758
and then you definitely
get kicked out.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.960
So what do you say?

40:43.642 --> 40:45.443
I can't do this.

40:53.852 --> 40:55.453
I'm sorry, Ari.

41:03.161 --> 41:05.063
What are you doing?

41:06.665 --> 41:08.199
Arun, what are you doing here?

41:08.233 --> 41:11.269
- I think you should leave.
- Whose are these?

41:11.302 --> 41:12.938
You need to go, okay?

41:12.971 --> 41:14.139
We'll get in trouble
if you're caught.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.074
Are you stealing these?

41:16.107 --> 41:17.242
I don't have
a choice, okay?

41:17.275 --> 41:19.044
[police radio chatter]

41:21.847 --> 41:24.716
Oh, my God.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.151
Come on!

41:33.158 --> 41:35.694
You are in a
rules violation!

41:46.805 --> 41:48.774
Maybe they didn't
see us go through!

41:48.807 --> 41:50.909
Move that!
Come on!

41:58.349 --> 42:00.518
I don't think
it's gonna hold.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.989
Damn it!

42:06.658 --> 42:08.126
Look!

42:08.159 --> 42:09.628
This isn't just one wall.

42:09.661 --> 42:10.796
There's two walls that
meet right here!

42:10.829 --> 42:14.733
They're gonna
bust through.

42:14.766 --> 42:15.767
- Push!
- Greta!

42:15.801 --> 42:16.968
Push!

42:22.608 --> 42:24.676
I didn't know
you could do that.

42:24.710 --> 42:26.845
Neither did I.

42:28.914 --> 42:30.115
We should go.

42:30.148 --> 42:31.950
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.251
So you wanna tell me
what that was all about?

42:33.284 --> 42:34.953
I can't.

42:34.986 --> 42:36.121
Well, you don't strike me
as a rule breaker.

42:36.154 --> 42:37.155
So what's the deal?

42:37.188 --> 42:39.057
- I'm a rebel.
- Yeah.

42:39.090 --> 42:41.059
That's why you were so eager
to join the Griefers, right?

42:41.092 --> 42:42.828
I was forced to join.
He made me.

42:42.861 --> 42:44.763
Who?

42:44.796 --> 42:46.097
Elliott.

42:46.131 --> 42:47.899
He wants me to steal
from my friend, Ari.

42:47.933 --> 42:50.636
What could he possibly have on
you that would make you do that?

42:50.669 --> 42:54.039
Look, I just racked up
two violations helping you.

42:54.072 --> 42:59.210
One more and I'm out.
You owe me an explanation!

42:59.244 --> 43:01.279
Okay, fine.
I'll tell you.

43:01.312 --> 43:03.348
But you're not gonna
like it or me.

43:11.890 --> 43:13.859
My parents.

43:13.892 --> 43:15.160
Whoa.

43:15.193 --> 43:18.664
Look, I know
it's freaky, but...

43:18.697 --> 43:21.332
That's awesome.

43:21.366 --> 43:23.869
I had no idea
how much you were like me.

43:31.877 --> 43:33.779
[phone rings]

43:35.714 --> 43:38.016
Stood up?

43:45.891 --> 43:47.859
* You got that
freaky karma *

43:47.893 --> 43:50.061
* You got that
sticky charm-a *

43:50.095 --> 43:52.163
* There's some
electric static *

43:52.197 --> 43:54.265
* Fulfilling in
your genes *

43:54.299 --> 43:57.002
* You've got no imitation...

44:03.008 --> 44:05.010
[knocking on door]

44:15.921 --> 44:19.390
I didn't join your game!

44:19.424 --> 44:22.193
If I find you,
I'm gonna report you!

44:23.328 --> 44:24.796
Idiots!

44:56.161 --> 44:57.462
Jennifer?

44:57.495 --> 44:58.997
Hey!

44:59.030 --> 45:02.033
Did you leave
this on my bed?

45:02.067 --> 45:03.835
I trusted you.

45:03.869 --> 45:07.338
I know, but we just need
a couple more people

45:07.372 --> 45:09.140
and then we'll
own this place.

45:09.174 --> 45:11.009
Don't you want the freedom
to do what you want here?

45:11.042 --> 45:12.443
Oh my God, you just sound
like one of those jerks!

45:12.477 --> 45:13.979
- Well, don't you?
- No.

45:14.012 --> 45:15.413
I want everyone to stay
out of my business!

45:15.446 --> 45:19.084
- That's what we want, too.
- Telling Arun

45:19.117 --> 45:21.152
definitely does not qualify as
staying out of my business.

45:21.186 --> 45:22.988
I can't believe
you told them.

45:23.021 --> 45:25.156
If you help out, they're
not even gonna tell anybody.

45:25.190 --> 45:29.194
- Jesus, Jennifer.
- Come on, just help us.

45:32.297 --> 45:33.965
Come on!

45:36.334 --> 45:38.269
* You put your crimes
on deposit *

45:38.303 --> 45:40.205
* And your reasons
on your back *

45:40.238 --> 45:42.173
* Your mind in the closet

45:42.207 --> 45:44.342
* And you leave it
where it's at *

45:44.375 --> 45:46.111
* You make some confessions.

45:46.144 --> 45:48.179
- Let's split up.
- Are you sure that's safe?

45:48.213 --> 45:49.347
We have to find him.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.983
Yeah, all right, here.
Take this.

45:52.017 --> 45:56.454
- If you need me, just hit send.
- All right.

45:56.487 --> 45:58.890
Yo!
I got t-shirts, sunglasses!

45:58.924 --> 46:01.126
- Coolest stuff here!
- Let's see it.

46:01.159 --> 46:04.195
- Cool. How much?
- $15.

46:04.229 --> 46:06.297
A whole lot cheaper
than the guy who was
selling them yesterday.

46:06.331 --> 46:07.966
[rumbling]

46:12.603 --> 46:16.041
- Oh, my God!
- Izzy, I'm so sorry!

46:16.074 --> 46:21.179
Oh, it's okay, Greta.
I'm gonna go change.

46:21.212 --> 46:22.848
If you see Arun, can you
tell him to wait for me?

46:22.881 --> 46:24.082
Yeah.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.521
Oh, hey, Greta.
Have you seen Izzy?

46:30.555 --> 46:33.158
No. I don't think
she's here yet.

46:33.191 --> 46:36.094
- Why don't we go get a drink?
- All right.

46:37.896 --> 46:39.197
You know, I didn't like
you when I first saw you.

46:39.230 --> 46:40.531
Awesome.

46:40.565 --> 46:42.500
I thought you were
a typical American.

46:42.533 --> 46:45.036
You know, arrogant,
egocentric.

46:45.070 --> 46:49.574
Then I saw what a softy
you were. It's endearing.

46:51.176 --> 46:54.612
* With all these
broken plans *

46:54.645 --> 46:57.415
* What's left for us
to do but dance *

46:57.448 --> 46:59.951
* We're stuck inside
the circumstance *

46:59.985 --> 47:02.053
Hey, Arun, hi.

47:02.087 --> 47:03.254
Have you seen a guy?

47:03.288 --> 47:06.324
Brown hair,
blue shirt, crazy eyes?

47:06.357 --> 47:09.327
Are you okay?
Here, have a drink.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.829
Thanks.

47:18.636 --> 47:22.340
So I'm coming to Amer...
to where you live.

47:22.373 --> 47:23.975
See some relatives.

47:24.009 --> 47:25.443
Thought maybe you
and I could...

47:25.476 --> 47:27.312
- Hey!
- You screwed me again!

47:27.345 --> 47:28.646
The Security came.
What was I supposed to do?

47:28.679 --> 47:30.515
God, you are so lame.

47:30.548 --> 47:32.550
- Hey, he's telling the truth.
- Look, stay out of it.

47:32.583 --> 47:34.252
Elliot, look,
I'm not your guy, all right?

47:34.285 --> 47:36.021
Look, I need you
to get rid of Ari.

47:36.054 --> 47:37.555
What do you mean,
get rid of him?

47:37.588 --> 47:38.556
What the hell do you
think I mean?

47:38.589 --> 47:40.125
He's my friend!

47:40.158 --> 47:41.893
Yeah, well,
it's either him or me.

47:41.927 --> 47:44.329
It's not really a hard choice.

47:45.997 --> 47:47.565
You were saying?

47:47.598 --> 47:49.167
Nothing.

47:49.200 --> 47:51.369
Yeah. That's what I thought.

47:52.370 --> 47:54.005
[rumbling]

47:55.640 --> 47:57.508
You guys feel that?

48:00.211 --> 48:01.479
So that's Elliott?

48:01.512 --> 48:05.951
Yeah.

48:05.984 --> 48:07.085
Woop!

48:07.118 --> 48:08.286
Well?

48:08.319 --> 48:10.355
He said
I have till midnight.

48:10.388 --> 48:13.024
Yeah. That's like
an hour from now.

48:13.058 --> 48:14.592
Well, why don't you be
a Griefer somewhere else

48:14.625 --> 48:16.461
and talk to me
in an hour then?

48:18.496 --> 48:21.699
You know, you might want
to think real hard on
that attitude.

48:21.732 --> 48:26.037
Looks like you
have competition.

48:26.071 --> 48:28.506
Don't be ridiculous.
Arun loves me.

48:28.539 --> 48:31.642
She looks like
a real woman to me.

48:37.248 --> 48:39.017
- Oh, hi, Izzy.
- Izzy?

48:39.050 --> 48:40.418
- Arun?
- Sorry about the date.

48:40.451 --> 48:41.987
I actually totally
forgot I made one.

48:42.020 --> 48:43.454
Really?
Where were you?

48:43.488 --> 48:45.323
- Well, he was with me.
- You?

48:45.356 --> 48:47.125
- Mm-hmm.
- It's not what you think.

48:47.158 --> 48:48.426
She's just helping me
with something.

48:48.459 --> 48:51.562
Greta, how could you?

48:51.596 --> 48:53.431
Oh, it's not
like that, Iz.

48:53.464 --> 48:55.200
It was important.

48:55.233 --> 48:59.504
That's all I get.
I had something important, too.

48:59.537 --> 49:01.606
What?

49:01.639 --> 49:03.574
It doesn't matter now.

49:03.608 --> 49:04.742
Hey!

49:04.775 --> 49:07.012
You know how
I feel about you.

49:07.045 --> 49:08.413
Do I?

49:10.648 --> 49:12.984
Yeah.

49:18.356 --> 49:20.391
I hate how you do that.

49:22.427 --> 49:23.961
Come on.

49:30.568 --> 49:32.370
[gasps]

49:32.403 --> 49:33.604
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you liked me.

49:33.638 --> 49:35.473
All I want from you
is answers!

49:35.506 --> 49:37.608
Well, there's a bedroom we can
use to unravel all my mysteries.

49:37.642 --> 49:39.410
First I want to know
why you don't bleed.

49:39.444 --> 49:41.046
Why are you
talking about?

49:41.079 --> 49:42.413
I jabbed you in the neck
with a scalpel.

49:42.447 --> 49:44.549
You're serious, aren't you?

49:44.582 --> 49:48.153
It doesn't matter.

49:48.186 --> 49:50.055
What's that?

49:50.088 --> 49:51.189
[grunts]

49:51.222 --> 49:52.490
That's me!

50:00.465 --> 50:02.233
I made a decision.

50:02.267 --> 50:05.436
Yes?

50:05.470 --> 50:10.075
I was thinking maybe that
we could be together for real?

50:10.108 --> 50:11.609
Are you serious?

50:13.711 --> 50:15.213
There's something
I need to tell you.

50:15.246 --> 50:16.681
Something important.

50:25.756 --> 50:29.760
Crap!
I gotta go! I'm late!

50:29.794 --> 50:32.797
But we'll meet up later.

50:40.105 --> 50:42.407
This is real.

51:10.635 --> 51:12.337
I feel strange.

51:12.370 --> 51:13.538
Me too.

51:13.571 --> 51:17.642
Everything looks familiar.

51:17.675 --> 51:21.146
But it's like I'm...

51:21.179 --> 51:22.813
seeing things
for the first time.

51:22.847 --> 51:25.116
Like that.

51:25.150 --> 51:28.119
You've seen
this 100 times.

51:28.153 --> 51:30.488
I know, but now
I don't like it.

51:30.521 --> 51:32.890
But it's my artwork.

51:32.923 --> 51:35.626
You love my artwork.
Everyone loves my artwork.

51:36.627 --> 51:38.796
[rumbling]

51:38.829 --> 51:40.198
What is that?

51:40.231 --> 51:41.399
Come on!

51:41.432 --> 51:42.400
Wait a minute!
Where are you going?

51:42.433 --> 51:43.868
To find out what that is!

51:43.901 --> 51:46.371
I think we should just
wait here until it finishes.

51:46.404 --> 51:47.672
We don't want to get
caught outside in a panic

51:47.705 --> 51:49.707
and get crushed.

51:49.740 --> 51:51.176
[gasps]

51:55.446 --> 51:56.914
See?

51:56.947 --> 51:59.817
All I see is that you
should be the one going first!

52:06.191 --> 52:09.327
Oh, get it together, Becca!

52:09.360 --> 52:11.462
You gotta help me! Please!
Help me!

52:11.496 --> 52:13.664
- Help!
- Look, look, I'm sorry.

52:13.698 --> 52:16.334
I'll do anything you want!
Just tell them to stop!

52:16.367 --> 52:17.702
I don't want it to be over.

52:17.735 --> 52:19.637
Let go of me!

52:19.670 --> 52:21.439
Please, please, help me!
Help me!

52:21.472 --> 52:22.440
I don't know what
you're talking about.

52:22.473 --> 52:23.841
Come on!

52:32.317 --> 52:34.452
- It's getting worse!
- What's going on?

52:34.485 --> 52:36.454
Hey, are we having
an earthquake?

52:36.487 --> 52:38.423
What are you talking
about, dude?

52:38.456 --> 52:41.226
- You don't feel that?
- Feel what?

52:43.728 --> 52:46.264
Becca, what's going on?

52:46.297 --> 52:47.732
I don't know.

52:49.334 --> 52:51.902
No, no, no!

52:57.442 --> 52:58.843
Look!

53:03.548 --> 53:05.550
Did that just happen?

53:08.586 --> 53:10.788
What's wrong with you?

53:10.821 --> 53:13.558
That guy just exploded right
in front of your eyes!

53:13.591 --> 53:14.692
Okay.

53:14.725 --> 53:16.627
What do you mean, okay?

53:16.661 --> 53:18.596
I'm sure he deserved it.

53:18.629 --> 53:20.498
Am I going insane?

53:20.531 --> 53:23.701
No, you're not.

53:23.734 --> 53:25.370
There's Arun and Izzy.

53:25.403 --> 53:27.838
Did you see that?
That guy, he just exploded!

53:27.872 --> 53:29.674
Hey, did you see
that guy explode?

53:29.707 --> 53:31.776
Hey, you're the dude
who designed these, right?

53:31.809 --> 53:33.778
- Yeah.
- They're awesome.

53:33.811 --> 53:34.879
Back to the guy
who ate the grenade!

53:34.912 --> 53:36.614
Sounds like he got axed.

53:36.647 --> 53:38.816
Please tell me
you saw that.

53:38.849 --> 53:39.884
- You did too?
- Yeah.

53:39.917 --> 53:41.352
I thought we
were losing it.

53:41.386 --> 53:42.587
Did you find
anyone else that did?

53:42.620 --> 53:44.422
We need to go to
the Campus Police.

53:44.455 --> 53:46.657
No. We can't go, okay?

53:46.691 --> 53:48.659
They'll think we're crazy!
They'll lock us up
or something.

53:48.693 --> 53:49.827
Seriously, Arun?

53:49.860 --> 53:51.596
No. Security must
know something.

53:51.629 --> 53:54.299
When Elliott attacked me,
they gave him one last warning.

53:54.332 --> 53:55.633
They have to know him.

53:55.666 --> 53:57.535
Maybe we just forget
all this happened.

53:57.568 --> 53:58.636
Sure. Sprinkle fairy
dust on it

53:58.669 --> 53:59.704
and wish it away.

53:59.737 --> 54:01.572
We can't just hide from this.

54:06.444 --> 54:07.978
What are you doing?

54:08.012 --> 54:09.547
What's it your business?

54:09.580 --> 54:12.517
Just thought you were
looking for someone.

54:12.550 --> 54:14.385
So what if I am?

54:14.419 --> 54:16.621
I'm good at finding people.

54:16.654 --> 54:18.756
Are you now?

54:18.789 --> 54:20.825
Give me a shot.

54:20.858 --> 54:25.430
I'm looking for
a girl named Izzy.

54:25.463 --> 54:28.433
- I thought you might be.
- You know her?

54:28.466 --> 54:31.336
Maybe. What do you
want with her?

54:31.369 --> 54:32.670
Her time is up.

54:32.703 --> 54:34.572
To join?

54:34.605 --> 54:36.307
Doesn't surprise me.

54:36.341 --> 54:39.977
Izzy is not the type
to join a person like you.

54:40.010 --> 54:45.816
Yes. Well, I can be
pretty persuasive.

54:45.850 --> 54:47.918
You've got something on her.

54:47.952 --> 54:52.457
Something she doesn't want
her boyfriend to find out.

54:52.490 --> 54:54.859
How do you know that?

54:54.892 --> 54:58.496
Tell me what it is
and I'll help you.

54:58.529 --> 55:00.531
I don't need your help.

55:00.565 --> 55:03.834
You're running out
of time, aren't you?

55:03.868 --> 55:05.936
Maybe she's waiting you out.

55:05.970 --> 55:10.475
Maybe she knows that Arun's not
gonna believe a guy like you.

55:10.508 --> 55:14.078
Now me

55:14.111 --> 55:15.746
me he'll believe.

55:25.490 --> 55:26.991
But that would
devastate him.

55:27.024 --> 55:31.829
Oh, all of a sudden,
you have a conscience.

55:31.862 --> 55:37.768
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it myself.

55:37.802 --> 55:39.870
There's got to be another
way to get her away from him.

55:43.173 --> 55:44.809
Do you guys feel different?

55:44.842 --> 55:46.611
- Different?
- How?

55:46.644 --> 55:52.517
I don't know, different,
like, awake or something?

55:52.550 --> 55:54.819
In a room full of people,
we're the only ones

55:54.852 --> 55:56.887
who saw what happened
to Elliott.

55:56.921 --> 55:58.589
You see that?

55:58.623 --> 56:00.691
I broke that into
pieces 15 minutes ago.

56:00.725 --> 56:02.159
How is that possible?

56:02.192 --> 56:04.829
How is it possible
that I can't get hurt?

56:05.963 --> 56:07.898
Show them.

56:12.770 --> 56:13.804
What did you do?

56:13.838 --> 56:16.073
- Are you crazy?
- Just wait.

56:21.011 --> 56:22.513
He's super human.

56:22.547 --> 56:24.014
I don't think it's just him.

56:24.048 --> 56:25.850
I think we're all connected.

56:25.883 --> 56:27.518
And it's time to find out
if I'm right.

56:27.552 --> 56:28.753
[shouts]

56:34.959 --> 56:36.093
Are you insane?

56:36.126 --> 56:37.562
Are you a crazy, woman?

56:37.595 --> 56:41.031
No. I'm not crazy.

56:41.065 --> 56:42.933
There's not a scratch.

56:42.967 --> 56:45.803
How is that possible?
What are we?

56:45.836 --> 56:48.072
I don't know.
I don't know what we are.

56:48.105 --> 56:49.807
I don't know where
we are either.

56:49.840 --> 56:51.609
What do you mean?
We're at college.

56:51.642 --> 56:55.613
Well, Becca has a theory
that maybe we're not.

56:55.646 --> 56:59.984
And not only are we different,
but maybe this whole place is.

57:00.017 --> 57:01.586
And what do you think?

57:01.619 --> 57:03.488
I don't know.

57:03.521 --> 57:05.022
What are you guys doing?

57:05.055 --> 57:06.724
Greta!

57:06.757 --> 57:07.925
Thank God, you're okay.

57:07.958 --> 57:08.993
Why wouldn't I be?

57:09.026 --> 57:10.528
I'm okay too, thanks.

57:10.561 --> 57:12.096
Your turn
to help me up, huh?

57:12.129 --> 57:14.565
Yeah, I think you've done
your share of falling.

57:14.599 --> 57:15.900
What are you guys doing?

57:15.933 --> 57:19.136
You mean the stairs?
That was, well...

57:19.169 --> 57:20.671
The stairs?

57:20.705 --> 57:21.739
We were talking
about the earthquake.

57:21.772 --> 57:23.674
What earthquake?

57:23.708 --> 57:25.910
Wait a second.
You didn't see any...

57:25.943 --> 57:28.145
- She's one of them.
- One of who?

57:28.178 --> 57:30.080
Okay, everyone just hold on.

57:30.114 --> 57:31.982
She's our friend, right, Izzy?

57:32.016 --> 57:33.117
She's not one of us.

57:33.150 --> 57:34.952
How do you know she's not?

57:34.985 --> 57:36.754
She said she's not, okay?
Why are you defending her?

57:36.787 --> 57:38.823
Because she's my friend!
She's my good friend!

57:38.856 --> 57:40.190
Good friend, huh?

57:40.224 --> 57:42.793
I guess I must be your
best friend then, right?

57:42.827 --> 57:44.795
What?

57:44.829 --> 57:46.263
What do you mean, what?

57:46.296 --> 57:48.699
I mean, you're my girlfriend,
not my friend.

57:48.733 --> 57:49.834
So we're not friends?

57:49.867 --> 57:51.969
No! I mean, yes!
I mean...

57:52.002 --> 57:53.871
I don't think that's
what Arun is saying, Iz.

57:53.904 --> 57:54.872
So now you know
what Arun thinks!

57:54.905 --> 57:56.641
I didn't say that.

57:56.674 --> 57:58.175
Maybe you shouldn't
say anything else.

57:58.208 --> 58:00.210
Stop! We don't have time
for this, all right?

58:00.244 --> 58:02.046
Let's split up and see if we
can maybe get some answers.

58:02.079 --> 58:04.649
Ari and I will go
to the campus infirmary

58:04.682 --> 58:06.517
and confront the doctors.

58:06.551 --> 58:08.218
I have a feeling that they've
seen other cases like ours

58:08.252 --> 58:10.054
and they're hiding it.

58:10.087 --> 58:13.090
Arun, you and Iz
go to Campus Security.

58:13.123 --> 58:14.224
Find out why they're
after Elliott.

58:14.258 --> 58:17.528
Meet back here in an hour.

58:17.562 --> 58:19.597
Maybe we can piece
this together.

58:19.630 --> 58:21.031
Let's go.

58:23.834 --> 58:26.671
Oh, I almost forgot.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.175
How did you get this?

58:31.208 --> 58:34.044
What is that?
Your room key?

58:34.078 --> 58:35.312
Well, sort of.

58:35.345 --> 58:36.681
What do you mean, sort of?

58:36.714 --> 58:38.583
Don't play games
with me, Arun.

58:38.616 --> 58:42.687
Is it yours or not?

58:42.720 --> 58:45.322
What the hell is she doing
with your key, Arun?

58:45.355 --> 58:48.893
Go ahead, Arun.
You can tell her.

58:48.926 --> 58:51.729
She told you her
secret after all.

58:51.762 --> 58:53.230
You're obviously
okay with it.

58:53.263 --> 58:55.933
I'm sure she'll be
fine with yours, too.

58:57.234 --> 58:59.203
Wait, what secret?

59:01.038 --> 59:02.573
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

59:02.607 --> 59:04.875
- I thought you told him.
- Told him what?

59:04.909 --> 59:06.076
Tell me what?

59:06.110 --> 59:07.778
Are you hiding
something from me?

59:07.812 --> 59:09.313
It sounds like you're
hiding something from me.

59:09.346 --> 59:11.582
No! No, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

59:11.616 --> 59:16.086
Oh, you two never met
for drinks.

59:17.287 --> 59:18.756
Why are you staring at me?

59:18.789 --> 59:21.191
Never your kind before.

59:21.225 --> 59:23.861
- What kind?
- I shouldn't have said that.

59:23.894 --> 59:27.031
That was incredibly
insensitive of me.

59:27.064 --> 59:28.599
[footsteps]

59:32.870 --> 59:34.038
What is your
problem with me?

59:34.071 --> 59:35.906
You both need to come
with me now.

59:35.940 --> 59:38.008
The Griefers are here and
they're looking for you both.

59:41.145 --> 59:42.346
Woo!

59:44.048 --> 59:45.616
You think there'll be
some answers here?

59:45.650 --> 59:47.317
There's got to be
answers somewhere.

59:48.786 --> 59:52.890
Oh, you're still here.

59:52.923 --> 59:55.159
What seems to
be the problem?

59:55.192 --> 59:56.694
You don't remember us?

59:56.727 --> 59:59.697
We came in here earlier.

59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.398
My friend had
fallen off a building

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.300
and you couldn't find
anything wrong with him.

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:09.039
Look, I know that our
story seemed crazy

01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:10.941
and you probably
didn't believe it

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:13.010
but now there's a whole bunch
of us who are just like him.

01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:14.745
Including me.

01:00:14.779 --> 01:00:17.047
- Are you sick?
- No, I'm not sick.

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:18.415
Would you like an exam?

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.184
No, I don't want an exam!

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:21.919
Has anybody else come
in with this story?

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:24.154
Come in, yes,
by all means, come in.

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:26.390
If you're not feeling well,
the nurse will be
with you shortly.

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:27.892
You're not listening, okay?

01:00:27.925 --> 01:00:29.927
We just fell down
a flight of stairs.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.696
We should have
broken our necks.

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:33.698
A nurse will be
with you shortly.

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:34.965
We don't want
a damned nurse!

01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:37.367
You don't
remember us at all?

01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:39.670
A nurse will be
with you shortly.

01:00:39.704 --> 01:00:41.205
Stop saying that!

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:43.207
Hey, stop!

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.676
Stop pretending like you
don't know anything!

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:49.013
What is going on
around here?

01:00:49.046 --> 01:00:51.415
A nurse will be
with you shortly.

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:55.085
[sighs]

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:02.392
- What do they want with you?
- What do they want with you?

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:04.361
Look, I already know you
went and saw them.

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.030
I know you did too.

01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:07.898
I don't know what
they want with me.

01:01:07.932 --> 01:01:10.968
- I already joined.
- You joined?

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:13.170
- How could you?
- I didn't have a choice.

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:14.805
Because of the secret
you're keeping from me.

01:01:14.839 --> 01:01:16.406
- What's your excuse?
- I didn't join!

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.109
They're forcing you to join

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:20.244
which means they
know your secret!

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:22.046
What secret?

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:23.147
The one that Greta said you
were gonna tell me about!

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.782
I can't think of any secret!

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:26.250
I don't even know why
I'm running!

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:27.417
But, you mean,
you don't remember?

01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:29.353
I remember going
to see them.

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:31.288
They threatened they'd tell you
something if I didn't join.

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:35.793
I remember being worried
but now I have no idea why.

01:01:35.826 --> 01:01:37.194
I wish somebody would tell me.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.069
Damn it!

01:01:45.102 --> 01:01:47.972
Listen, hey.
It's gonna be okay, all right?

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:49.740
Look, we'll figure this out.

01:01:49.774 --> 01:01:52.109
Will we?

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:54.912
We've gotten
this far, right?

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:57.281
Thank God,
somebody to talk to!

01:01:57.314 --> 01:01:59.449
There's this guy, he just...

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:01.786
Well, I know
this sounds crazy.

01:02:01.819 --> 01:02:04.922
But he blew up
and then vanished.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:07.224
Continue.

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:09.960
And there's a bunch of us
who have survived stuff
that should have killed us.

01:02:09.994 --> 01:02:12.897
Some of these people,
this doctor, they're not
even acting human.

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:15.465
I know this sounds crazy
but we're telling the truth.

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:17.534
- Are you a memory resident?
- What?

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.436
I said are you
memory residents?

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:20.905
Whoa, whoa, whoa, fellas.

01:02:20.938 --> 01:02:22.272
Listen, we don't
want any trouble.

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:24.108
- We just want answers.
- Are you polymorphic?

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:26.343
- What are you talking about?
- We don't understand.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:28.512
- Identify yourselves.
- I'm Becca.

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:30.214
Ari.

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.282
We said identify yourselves!

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:34.118
We just told you who we are!

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:36.320
- Are you Melissa?
- Are you deaf?

01:02:36.353 --> 01:02:37.855
I just told you
my name is Becca!

01:02:37.888 --> 01:02:39.089
Sorry to bother you.
We'll just...

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:41.325
We have a Code 51.

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:43.527
We need to take care of
them before they spread it
to the others.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.329
[rumbling]

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:52.937
It didn't work.

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:54.471
They need to be isolated.

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:56.106
Don't let them get away.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:02.512
Great. There's nobody here.
Maybe we can radio them.

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:04.181
Wait. This plan
is not gonna work.

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:05.282
They've already seen me.

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:06.817
Look, I'll go talk to them.

01:03:06.851 --> 01:03:07.818
You don't even
know why we're here.

01:03:07.852 --> 01:03:09.319
You didn't see anything.

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:10.888
Arun and I will talk to them.

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:12.456
He can't.
He'll get kicked out.

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.959
Is that true?

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:16.093
How did you even know that?

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.527
I was there.

01:03:17.561 --> 01:03:20.064
Yeah, and you were there
at the Griefers too.

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:24.835
- And the bar and the party.
- So?

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:28.973
So don't you think
it's strange that you seem
to be everywhere we are?

01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:31.075
It's not an accident
we met you, is it?

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:32.342
That's ridiculous.

01:03:32.376 --> 01:03:33.844
You meant to knock
on Arun's door.

01:03:33.878 --> 01:03:36.046
That's crazy!

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.849
Arun, are you really
gonna believe someone
who's always lied to you?

01:03:38.883 --> 01:03:40.417
One thing is sure.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:42.219
I know more about both of
you than you do each other!

01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:44.054
We have a problem here?

01:03:44.088 --> 01:03:45.923
We want to know if anybody's
gone missing recently.

01:03:45.956 --> 01:03:47.557
What do you mean?

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:50.194
We mean, we want to know
if someone's gone missing.

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:51.495
We want to know
if there's others.

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:53.898
People leave all the time.

01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:56.934
No, he didn't leave.
The whole place was shaking

01:03:56.967 --> 01:03:58.068
and he disappeared
out of nowhere.

01:03:58.102 --> 01:03:59.569
More like exploded.

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:02.006
- You saw him disintegrate?
- Identify yourselves.

01:04:02.039 --> 01:04:04.241
- Izzy.
- Arun.

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:05.342
Shiva101.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:07.577
You, over there.

01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:10.380
- We may have a Code 51.
- Code 51?

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:12.249
Are you Melissa?

01:04:12.282 --> 01:04:13.483
No, I just told you
I'm Izzy.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.986
- I'm Arun.
- Code 51.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.388
Are you certain it's a 51
and not an infraction?

01:04:18.422 --> 01:04:20.925
Affirmative. 51.

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:23.928
We need to take
care of them before
they spread it to the others.

01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:25.229
[rumbling]

01:04:31.335 --> 01:04:32.369
Nothing.

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:34.304
They need to be isolated.

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:37.474
Arun, run!

01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:39.576
You blocked us
from our objectives.

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.345
Your time here
has now expired.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.380
I'm sorry, okay?

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:46.016
Look, I know where
they're going.

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:47.918
[rumbling]

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:50.687
Can you hear me?

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.389
I said I know where
they're going!

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:54.158
Show us.

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:02.299
They're trying to
destroy us like Elliott!

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:04.168
But it didn't work!
Why didn't it work?

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:06.070
Who cares?
I mean, they want to isolate us?

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:07.637
What the hell does that mean?

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:08.638
It means they want to keep
us away from everyone!

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:10.207
What did we do?

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.408
It's what they
don't want us to do.

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:12.609
- Which is?
- Tell other people!

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:14.278
Tell who, Iz?
No one believes us!

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:16.046
Maybe they're afraid
someone will.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.382
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:20.084
This all started
when you kissed me.

01:05:20.117 --> 01:05:22.152
When I kissed you?

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:26.590
- Where are you going?
- To warn Becca and Ari.

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:32.062
- We need to get out of here!
- And abandon our friends?

01:05:32.096 --> 01:05:33.130
I don't know who you are.

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:34.531
[laughs]

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:36.300
That's funny.

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:38.102
I bet he doesn't know
who you are either.

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:39.203
[rumbling]

01:05:39.236 --> 01:05:40.704
Yo!

01:05:40.737 --> 01:05:43.240
These tremors, they mean
you're next, right?

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.509
Do I let your boyfriend
in on your secret?

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:48.245
Why is this happening?
Who's doing this to you?

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:49.513
Dude?

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:51.348
You know exactly
what is happening.

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:53.383
You figured you'd
wait me out.

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:54.618
You're crazy!

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:57.321
At least
I'm not some freak!

01:05:57.354 --> 01:05:59.656
- I'm going to tell him.
- Go ahead and tell him.

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.458
Everyone keeps talking
about this secret.

01:06:01.491 --> 01:06:02.692
I'd like to know what it is.

01:06:02.726 --> 01:06:07.164
Fine! I lose, you lose.

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:10.034
Your girlfriend's not
really your girlfriend.

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:13.237
Izzy is actually...
She's a...

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:15.172
No!

01:06:15.205 --> 01:06:17.474
[screaming]

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:22.479
Jennifer!

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:25.149
You came for free!

01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:28.152
No!

01:06:28.185 --> 01:06:30.254
What's happening?

01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:32.556
Arun, run!

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:35.759
Run!

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:41.331
Arun!

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:16.366
- What the hell?
- We're back where we started.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.767
No, no, that's
not possible.

01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:19.303
I alternated turns
so that wouldn't happen.

01:07:19.336 --> 01:07:20.704
Let's get out of here.

01:07:23.307 --> 01:07:24.608
Locked.

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:39.323
Look!

01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:41.558
Now what?

01:07:52.702 --> 01:07:54.771
I'm getting the hang of this.

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:57.741
That tremor, that's
what happened to Elliott
when he disappeared.

01:07:57.774 --> 01:07:59.309
That's what they're
trying to do to us.

01:07:59.343 --> 01:08:02.646
Someone is controlling
who stays and who goes.

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:03.847
Security?

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:07.117
Izzy and Arun.

01:08:09.353 --> 01:08:11.621
Arun, thank God
you're okay!

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:13.157
We have to get
out of here!

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:14.591
- Where's Izzy?
- There's more guys.

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:17.661
They just vanished,
just exploded!

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:19.296
- Code 51?
- What does that mean?

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:21.331
Where is she?
Where is Izzy?

01:08:21.365 --> 01:08:22.499
I don't know.

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:23.733
Greta, she just
told me run and...

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:26.435
- You left her?
- Where is she, Arun?

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:29.173
They captured her.
Izzy, they caught her.

01:08:29.206 --> 01:08:30.807
Where is Izzy?

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.242
The frat house,
south side.

01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:33.609
Let's go.

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:38.682
You bitch!

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:42.152
Oh, nothing personal,
Iz or whoever you really are.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:44.554
You were right about me.

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:47.524
It was no coincidence that
I showed up to Arun's dorm room.

01:08:47.557 --> 01:08:49.658
We've been promised to
each other since birth,

01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:51.361
but I'd never met him,

01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:53.763
and I was certainly not
gonna get married in that way.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.299
So you lied to him.

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:56.666
Don't talk to me
about lying!

01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:02.639
I wanted what you want,
what everybody wants.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.774
To fall in love.

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:06.776
I only had two choices.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:10.413
Marry him or run away
and leave my family.

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:12.916
So I decided to see this man.

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:15.685
Is he someone I could like?

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:18.255
Maybe love?

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:19.622
And?

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.725
There's a lot of potential.

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:23.260
He loves me.

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:25.194
You do complicate things,

01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:28.732
but I couldn't tell him
the truth about you.

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:32.336
Trashing your relationship
was a good start

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.537
but I couldn't rely on that.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:36.305
I needed something else
to get you out.

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.509
Apparently, I've found it.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:42.912
You blocked our objective.
You will be terminated.

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:45.314
But I got you this one.

01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:47.584
[rumbling]

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:48.785
Please, don't do this!

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:49.986
Not yet!

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.287
I still have things
I can tell him!

01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:53.890
I'm not done yet!

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:56.626
- Greta!
- Arun!

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.395
Don't worry,
I'll see you soon.

01:09:58.428 --> 01:09:59.963
There are the others!

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.968
No!

01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:06.536
- Arun, she was one of them.
- Come on!

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:07.871
Hold it right there!

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:14.244
- I think we're okay.
- Okay?

01:10:14.278 --> 01:10:15.645
You call people exploding
everywhere okay?

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:17.947
Let's see.

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:19.949
What's the common thread
between us and everyone
else who's been destroyed?

01:10:19.983 --> 01:10:22.286
Okay, the Griefers were
forcing people to join them.

01:10:22.319 --> 01:10:24.554
- Elliott was terrorizing me.
- He was stealing from me.

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:26.823
And Greta helped us
escape from the guards.

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:28.892
So what did we do?

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:32.429
I tried stealing from you.

01:10:32.462 --> 01:10:34.331
- You what?
- Elliott, he made me.

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:35.532
How?

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:37.401
Everyone acted
against the rules.

01:10:37.434 --> 01:10:39.002
Well, we didn't.

01:10:39.035 --> 01:10:40.904
We tried to figure out
what the hell was going on.

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:42.706
So how come
we didn't get taken out?

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:44.974
I don't know, but
we need to find Izzy.

01:10:45.008 --> 01:10:46.276
[footsteps]

01:10:50.347 --> 01:10:52.449
Oh, crap!

01:10:52.482 --> 01:10:53.717
We're trapped!

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:56.920
Push!

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:02.058
What was that?

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.593
Thank Greta.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.733
How the hell do
we get out of here?

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.368
We need to find Izzy!

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:12.769
We're no good to her
if we get caught!

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:13.837
Let's get out of here.
We'll find help.

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:15.372
- There must be an exit.
- There!

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:20.544
They're trying to get out.

01:11:20.577 --> 01:11:21.878
Good.

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:26.683
[chanting]

01:11:32.356 --> 01:11:33.923
We're back
where we started!

01:11:36.693 --> 01:11:38.027
Hey, you guys!

01:11:38.061 --> 01:11:39.829
These guards are trying
to shut you down!

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:42.599
These guys are trying
to root us out!

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:49.506
Let's go.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.018
It's like they're
playing a game with us!

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:03.820
What'd you say?

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:06.923
It's like they're
playing a game.

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:08.492
Do you go to school here?

01:12:08.525 --> 01:12:12.362
Yeah. I figured out
a way to cheat.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.607
A nurse will be
with you shortly.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.443
- We don't want a damn nurse!
- You don't remember us at all?

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:27.944
A nurse will be
with you shortly.

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:35.719
We're in a game.

01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:38.021
What?

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:39.723
We're in a game.

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:45.962
- This is crazy!
- What's crazy?

01:12:45.995 --> 01:12:48.465
Check this out.
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:50.099
We have got four
separate viruses working
at the same time.

01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:52.702
How is that possible?

01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:55.905
I don't know, but it's not
responding to the built-in
antiviral software.

01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:57.741
- Should I quarantine it?
- I've quarantined one,

01:12:57.774 --> 01:12:59.142
but it's not letting me do
anything with the others.

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:01.678
Let's try something
a little stronger.

01:13:04.948 --> 01:13:06.650
That's the best you can do?

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:07.951
A game?

01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:09.486
It's a little
far-fetched, Becca.

01:13:09.519 --> 01:13:14.023
You think?

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:17.160
Hi. I'm new here.
What should I do?

01:13:17.193 --> 01:13:19.663
Join a group.
Go to class.

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:20.697
And what about partying?

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:21.965
Just play by the rules.

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:24.167
And what happens if I don't?

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.603
- You get kicked out.
- Kicked out of what?

01:13:26.636 --> 01:13:28.438
The game.

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.843
It's impossible.

01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:35.679
Wait.

01:13:35.712 --> 01:13:39.449
The ones who don't respond
and give stock answers?

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:42.886
I think no-one's
playing them.

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:47.591
So that means what?

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:49.693
No one's playing us.

01:13:49.726 --> 01:13:52.128
Then we should be
like them.

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:55.632
We shouldn't know
we're in a game.

01:13:57.534 --> 01:13:59.435
This should eliminate them.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.722
Hey, we're alive in here!

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:30.166
- Yes.
- What?

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:34.871
Before I stabbed you,
you asked me to dinner.

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:37.106
Yes.

01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:46.650
I have an idea.

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:48.885
Are you crazy?
Sit down!

01:14:49.886 --> 01:14:52.556
Hey! Hey!

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:04.267
Hey, right here!
Come get me!

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.736
Come on!
Come on over here!

01:15:12.609 --> 01:15:15.044
Shut it down!
You're taking out the players!

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:20.216
Hey!

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:21.851
Hey!

01:15:21.885 --> 01:15:22.852
Oh.

01:15:22.886 --> 01:15:24.554
Becca!

01:15:24.588 --> 01:15:26.089
[shrieks]

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.293
Izzy!

01:15:30.326 --> 01:15:31.861
How?

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.630
I broke free.

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:37.166
Oh!

01:15:41.104 --> 01:15:43.072
What's going on?
We're fielding calls

01:15:43.106 --> 01:15:45.108
left and right about avatars
getting blown from the game?

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:48.612
- It's under control.
- Yeah, it better be.

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:50.313
What are we dealing with?

01:15:50.346 --> 01:15:54.751
An incredibly advanced
virus, really advanced.

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:57.253
You know the one
I had quarantined?

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.688
It broke through.

01:15:58.722 --> 01:16:03.660
What are you saying?
It adapted?

01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:06.796
I mean, viruses can't adapt.

01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:10.600
That would make them alive.

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:34.157
[knocking on door]

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.760
Arun?

01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:37.994
I made you some tea.

01:16:38.027 --> 01:16:39.829
Thanks, Mom.

01:16:39.863 --> 01:16:41.798
You will have
a visitor next week.

01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:44.200
- Yeah? Who?
- Brianna.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:16:59.649
I can't marry that.

01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:08.324
Papa? Mommy?

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:11.127
I'm not agreeing
to marriage

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.262
but I'll go and meet Arun.

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.769
[groans]

01:17:19.803 --> 01:17:21.104
Dude, what'd
you do that for?

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.972
I don't know.

01:17:23.006 --> 01:17:24.841
Dude, we're this close to
having real life cyber sex!

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:26.910
I've been chipping in
all my allowance for this!

01:17:26.943 --> 01:17:28.745
Come on, let's just go.

01:17:28.778 --> 01:17:31.047
I don't get you, man.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.215
[sighs]

01:17:32.248 --> 01:17:33.850
Good luck, Izzy.

01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:50.399
I'm ready to meet Arun.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:03.146
What's going on?

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:05.081
Where's my Izzy?

01:18:07.383 --> 01:18:10.486
I put in a tech service
request six hours ago

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.756
and reported this guy
at the same time!

01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:14.490
Hey, every minute that
he is operating

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.325
and I am not,
I am losing money!

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:17.894
Calm down?

01:18:17.927 --> 01:18:19.829
No, this is how
I make my living!

01:18:19.863 --> 01:18:22.398
I set myself up to do
in-game sales

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.367
totally according
to your guidelines.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.002
No, okay?

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:27.804
Look, it is still
not working.

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:32.175
Like I told the other guy,
I signed off for a few hours.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.177
I come back and
I'm locked out!

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:37.981
Fine, but it better
be 10 minutes!

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:42.318
I have got to stop this guy.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.922
Say hello to Ari 2.

01:18:47.891 --> 01:18:51.327
So why us?

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.531
I mean, how did
we become alive?

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.400
I think I did it.

01:18:57.433 --> 01:19:01.370
You? How?

01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:03.873
My tear on Ari.

01:19:03.907 --> 01:19:06.142
Then I drank
from Arun's cup.

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:09.512
And then I kissed Arun.

01:19:09.545 --> 01:19:11.447
But we're not playing against

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.249
the rules of the game
like the others,

01:19:13.282 --> 01:19:17.353
we're destroying
the rules, the game.

01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:19.923
And they're afraid we'll
infect everyone else.

01:19:19.956 --> 01:19:22.225
So who gave it to you?

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:24.227
No idea.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.930
So now what?

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:30.800
Nothing.
There's nowhere to run.

01:19:30.834 --> 01:19:33.970
They're just gonna keep at
us until they wipe us out.

01:19:34.003 --> 01:19:37.106
So, what?
We just turn ourselves over?

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.109
No.
No, we can't give up.

01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:44.047
We just have to let
them know we're alive.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:50.887
How?

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:54.057
We communicate
with our makers.

01:20:16.379 --> 01:20:19.315
* We never liked the way
you said about our situation *

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:21.084
* We never really liked

01:20:21.117 --> 01:20:22.385
* The things you said
and did at all *

01:20:22.418 --> 01:20:24.020
* You told us
all we needed *

01:20:24.053 --> 01:20:25.488
* Was a little bit
of patience *

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:27.190
* But then we turned
around and *

01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:28.925
* Found our backs
against the wall *

01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:30.426
* So now we're forced
to find a way *

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:32.161
* That we can turn the tables

01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:33.562
* So now we're looking
for a thing *

01:20:33.596 --> 01:20:35.131
* To help us find a way

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:36.933
* We'll keep on going

01:20:36.966 --> 01:20:38.501
* Just as long as we
are young and able. *

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:40.403
* We'll keep on coming

01:20:40.436 --> 01:20:42.205
* Until we save the day

01:20:42.238 --> 01:20:44.974
* You need some instruction

01:20:45.008 --> 01:20:49.378
* Here comes some disruption

01:20:51.314 --> 01:20:54.617
* You need some instruction

01:20:54.650 --> 01:21:00.589
* Here comes some disruption

01:21:03.993 --> 01:21:05.494
* You put a thumb across

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:07.263
* Our hopes and plans
and aspirations *

01:21:07.296 --> 01:21:08.464
* Drop a conviction
and a sentence *

01:21:08.497 --> 01:21:10.566
* On our only dreams

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:12.235
* Your dirty trick
and lying pricks *

01:21:12.268 --> 01:21:13.937
* Have reached
the culmination *

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:15.438
* We cannot take
another crime, a con *

01:21:15.471 --> 01:21:16.906
* Another scheme

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:18.574
* We're set for giving back

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:20.043
* All of the things we
think we're getting *

01:21:20.076 --> 01:21:21.477
* We're set for taking back

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:23.412
* Our pride and all
our dignity *

01:21:23.446 --> 01:21:26.382
* We're getting ready for
a total Armageddon *

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:28.317
* We're getting ready
though to get it *

01:21:28.351 --> 01:21:29.986
* Gonna set it free

01:21:30.019 --> 01:21:32.688
* You need some instruction

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:38.194
* Here comes some disruption

01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:42.431
* You need some instruction

01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:48.938
* Here comes some disruption
