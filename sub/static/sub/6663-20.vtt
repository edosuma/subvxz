00:00.667 --> 00:01.700
Adult adam:
<i>Back in the '80s,</i>

00:01.702 --> 00:04.169
<i>You only had three options</i>
<i>for birthday parties...</i>

00:04.171 --> 00:06.438
<i>Roller skating,</i>
<i>chuck e. Cheese,</i>

00:06.440 --> 00:08.640
<i>Or seeing</i>
<i>a wildly inappropriate movie</i>

00:08.642 --> 00:11.610
<i>Because your parents</i>
<i>didn't know any better.</i>

00:11.612 --> 00:12.711
<i>And then...</i>

00:12.713 --> 00:13.779
<i>Everything changed!</i>

00:13.781 --> 00:15.447
We're playing
laser tag tonight, people.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.116
I know.
It's gonna be awesome!

00:17.118 --> 00:20.352
But you know what's
gonna make it even more fun?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.987
Protective
cornea goggles.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.990
No. No way. Why the hell do
I need to protect my corneas?

00:24.992 --> 00:29.495
Because sue nagleman's son
lost his eye to a laser beam.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.897
It wasn't a laser.
It was a taser.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.932
And you don't talk back
to cops.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.034
It's safe, mom.

00:35.036 --> 00:35.834
Laser tag's for little kids.

00:35.836 --> 00:40.406
For your information,
there are many adults
that enjoy playing laser tag.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.607
I admit,
they look kind of weird

00:41.609 --> 00:43.175
Waiting on
that single-player bench,

00:43.177 --> 00:46.478
With their desperate eyes
just staring at you.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.079
(sighs)

00:47.081 --> 00:48.714
Whatever!
It's fun for everyone!

00:48.716 --> 00:50.382
But mostly
dorky, little kids.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.184
Well, I'll never
be a fan of lasers,

00:52.186 --> 00:54.920
But my scrumptious,
little snuggle monster

00:54.922 --> 00:57.322
Gets whatever he wants
on his birthday.

00:57.324 --> 00:59.425
I want you to stop calling me
"snuggle monster".

00:59.427 --> 01:02.995
Can't give you that.
But I can... Give you this.

01:02.997 --> 01:05.230
(singsong voice)
it's present time!

01:05.232 --> 01:07.733
What the heck
is a sleeping angel book?

01:07.735 --> 01:11.003
I've been taking pictures
of you sleeping once a month

01:11.005 --> 01:14.006
Since you were born, my angel,
and I made it into a book.

01:14.008 --> 01:16.708
If you flip through it,
you can see how much
your head has grown.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.511
Why does it say
"sleeping angel part one"?

01:19.513 --> 01:21.346
You'll find out
when you go to college.

01:21.348 --> 01:22.548
Adult adam:
<i>While my mom gave gifts,</i>

01:22.550 --> 01:24.716
<i>My dad had his own</i>
<i>birthday tradition...</i>

01:24.718 --> 01:25.417
<i>Forgetting.</i>

01:25.419 --> 01:28.053
Hey. My foot hurts.
What's for breakfast?

01:28.055 --> 01:30.089
Well, we're celebrating
you-know-who

01:30.091 --> 01:32.825
With "a" shaped
pancakes.

01:32.827 --> 01:34.093
"a"!

01:34.095 --> 01:36.862
(chuckling)
it almost slipped my mind.

01:36.864 --> 01:37.496
Al capone!

01:37.498 --> 01:41.200
Geraldo rivera is opening up
al capone's vault today

01:41.202 --> 01:43.635
Live on television!

01:43.637 --> 01:44.336
It's like my birthday.

01:44.338 --> 01:47.039
Wow.
Okay, murray.
Stop playing around.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.674
You know what day it is.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.476
Yeah, of course.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.910
It's, um...

01:51.912 --> 01:53.445
Murray: Baby!

01:53.447 --> 01:54.780
Baby out.

01:54.782 --> 01:55.914
Baby day.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.850
Baby... Birth.

01:57.852 --> 01:59.418
Baby rocking.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.086
Birth day.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.588
Birthday!

02:02.590 --> 02:03.522
My son...

02:03.524 --> 02:07.226
Who is way more important
than al capone.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.428
Daddy and I also got you that,
didn't we, mur?

02:09.430 --> 02:13.332
Yeah. Open it up.
It's gonna blow your mind.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.633
I'm not much for surprises.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.635
How about you tell me
what you got me, mur?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.070
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's a surprise.

02:18.072 --> 02:20.739
Tell me what you got me.
It's a surprise.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.574
Say it in words.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.308
Um...

02:23.310 --> 02:26.478
It's, uh, a...
A dancing lady.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.413
A, uh, dancing...

02:28.415 --> 02:33.352
An angry, dancing
karate-monkey.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.820
Wow.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.289
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:37.291 --> 02:41.693
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

02:43.796 --> 02:44.530
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:44.532 --> 02:48.333
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

02:48.335 --> 02:50.536
Adult adam:
<i>It was mid-April,</i>
<i>1980-something.</i>

02:50.538 --> 02:53.005
<i>I was still on an epic quest</i>
<i>to get my first kiss</i>

02:53.007 --> 02:56.175
<i>From my kinda/sorta/maybe</i>
<i>girlfriend, dana caldwell.</i>

02:56.177 --> 02:59.378
<i>Thankfully, my favorite</i>
<i>afroed tv painter, bob ross,</i>

02:59.380 --> 03:01.613
<i>Was there</i>
<i>to break the tension.</i>

03:01.615 --> 03:04.049
I like the way
he paints trees.

03:04.051 --> 03:07.019
The best.
You should see
what he does with cottages.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.187
Bob ross:
<i>...Indication here and there</i>

03:08.189 --> 03:10.122
<i>Of some happy, little</i>
<i>evergreen trees.</i>

03:10.124 --> 03:12.958
Well, I should
probably get going.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.825
Oh. Okay.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.828
So, I'll see you
at laser tag?
Yeah.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.230
I hope I'm on your team.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.899
I'll see what I can do,
but no guarantees.

03:20.901 --> 03:24.636
There's gonna be two captains.
Could get complicated.

03:24.904 --> 03:27.940
So... Happy birthday?

03:34.914 --> 03:36.949
Up high?

03:38.484 --> 03:39.685
Adult adam:
<i>Sure, it wasn't my first kiss,</i>

03:39.687 --> 03:43.555
<i>But this double wiggly</i>
<i>high-five was just as good,</i>

03:43.557 --> 03:46.625
<i>I tried to tell myself.</i>

03:46.793 --> 03:48.060
(door closes)

03:48.062 --> 03:48.594
Pathetic, dude.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.896
Oh, like you could do
any better.

03:50.898 --> 03:51.563
Hell yeah, I could!

03:51.565 --> 03:54.700
Big tasty knows how to tame
the booty with the beat.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.535
You got to kiss her, bro!

03:56.537 --> 03:57.569
I know!

03:57.571 --> 03:59.037
Just... The timing
hasn't been right.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.473
I've been busy,
she's been busy.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.774
Her family went
to sarasota.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.444
I had that cold
and that spanish quiz.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.813
Well,
now the timing's right.

04:07.815 --> 04:08.714
It's your birthday.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.516
Tonight, you got to throw
a full-on make-out party.

04:11.518 --> 04:12.851
A laser tag
make-out party?

04:12.853 --> 04:14.653
Logistically,
how would that even work?

04:14.655 --> 04:17.756
No laser tag!
Just make-out party!

04:17.758 --> 04:18.523
What am I?
Scott baio?

04:18.525 --> 04:20.759
I don't know how to throw
a make-out party.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.994
That's why you call...

04:21.996 --> 04:23.195
(imitates dialing)

04:23.197 --> 04:25.631
Barry's make-out parties.
How can I help you?

04:25.633 --> 04:28.533
Can you tell my brother
he's a giant putz?

04:28.535 --> 04:29.268
(sighs)

04:29.270 --> 04:31.903
Okay, we turn the basement
into a love den.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.005
How?
It's dark and dusty

04:33.007 --> 04:35.340
And smells like
your old, sweaty hockey gear.

04:35.342 --> 04:38.510
Pheromones, bro!
Ladies love it.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.078
And we'll light
some incense,

04:40.080 --> 04:41.880
Then we'll deck it out
with sexy accessories

04:41.882 --> 04:46.084
Like moroccan pillows,
lava lamps, and bongo drums.

04:46.086 --> 04:46.885
I'm intrigued.
Go on.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.121
And we serve
the sexiest foods.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.156
Go on.
Oysters.

04:51.158 --> 04:51.990
Soft cheeses.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.992
Go on.
And onion dip.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.727
Nothing crunchy.

04:55.729 --> 04:56.728
Know why?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.163
Crunchy isn't sexy.
Wait.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.732
How do you eat onion dip
if you don't have anything...

05:00.734 --> 05:01.867
Spoons!

05:01.869 --> 05:02.934
Spoons are sexy.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.937
You obviously know
what you're talking about.

05:05.939 --> 05:06.638
But (sighs)

05:06.640 --> 05:08.106
How do I get dana
to kiss me?

05:08.108 --> 05:10.742
Easy.
Break the ice with games.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.011
Twister, truth or dare,

05:13.013 --> 05:14.913
And the main event...

05:14.915 --> 05:15.647
Seven minutes in heaven.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.317
And you got to wear
something seductive,
so go to the mall,

05:18.319 --> 05:21.119
And buy the first
velour clothing you see.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.755
That's the sexiest
of all fabrics.

05:23.757 --> 05:24.289
Velour. Got it.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.224
Adult adam:
<i>I was so desperate</i>
<i>for my first kiss</i>

05:26.226 --> 05:27.559
<i>That barry</i>
<i>was actually making sense.</i>

05:27.561 --> 05:31.196
<i>Meanwhile, my dad</i>
<i>was desperate</i>
<i>to watch some "geraldo".</i>

05:31.198 --> 05:32.964
(door closes)
mmm!

05:32.966 --> 05:34.232
Smells great in here!

05:34.234 --> 05:37.069
Yeah, I went to
the south street
italian market

05:37.071 --> 05:40.238
In honor of the opening
of al capone's vault.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.907
Truly, it's the most exciting
thing to happen to me

05:41.909 --> 05:44.076
In the past 20 years.
What about your kids?

05:44.078 --> 05:46.111
Oh, they're not
gonna be here.
Oh.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.946
Adam's got a thing tonight.

05:47.948 --> 05:48.914
A thing?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.315
It's his birthday party.

05:50.317 --> 05:53.352
Tell me at least
you remembered it this year.

05:53.354 --> 05:56.121
Ah. It's not whether or not
I remembered.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.390
It's whether
he thinks I remembered.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.092
I don't think
you remembered.

06:00.094 --> 06:01.860
There's the man
I'm looking for.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.896
Happy birthday, kiddo.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.933
Holy god.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.068
A digital pac-man watch?
Do you like it?

06:10.070 --> 06:13.505
Uh, it's a video game
on my wrist!

06:13.507 --> 06:14.506
I love it!

06:14.508 --> 06:15.073
Thanks, pops.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.909
You are the greatest man
I've ever known.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.812
Literally
the greatest man.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.222
What was that
all about?

06:30.224 --> 06:32.157
Did you not give him
a gift?

06:32.159 --> 06:34.593
It's not
whether I got him a gift,

06:34.595 --> 06:38.130
It's whether he thinks
I got him a gift.

06:38.132 --> 06:38.830
Adam: I don't!

06:38.832 --> 06:41.066
Murray,
you do this every year.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.301
For once,
just get him something!

06:43.303 --> 06:47.038
Everybody knows
that I'm not good at birthdays

06:47.040 --> 06:50.075
Or giving gifts
or remembering events.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.243
It's my thing!

06:51.245 --> 06:52.978
Well,
you're missing out.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.447
I mean, did you see
the look on adam's face

06:55.449 --> 06:58.950
When I gave him
that puckm'n watch thing?

06:58.952 --> 06:59.384
Pure joy!

06:59.386 --> 07:01.887
That's why we should say
the watch is from both of us.

07:01.889 --> 07:05.290
Just go get the kid
a damn gift already!

07:05.292 --> 07:08.560
Adult adam:  <i>While my dad</i>
<i>had to suck it up</i>
<i>and get me a gift,</i>

07:08.562 --> 07:09.494
<i>I was about to hurt my mom</i>

07:09.496 --> 07:13.064
<i>Worse than having all her leg</i>
<i>hair yanked out by an epilady.</i>

07:13.066 --> 07:15.200
Whoops!
Ooh, I'll come back.

07:15.202 --> 07:15.901
No, it's fine, boopie.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.737
(buzzing)
good.
'cause I was thinking,

07:18.739 --> 07:19.504
Instead of laser tag,

07:19.506 --> 07:24.009
Maybe me and my friends
could hang out in the basement
and watch "ghostbusters".

07:24.011 --> 07:26.178
What?
I'm not canceling laser tag.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.780
(buzzing stops)
they wanted
a $100 deposit

07:28.782 --> 07:30.048
Until I yelled at the guy
to waive it.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.784
I know it's last minute,
but I really want this.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.987
I guess I could make
a "ghostbusters" cake.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.057
Yeah...
I'm also thinking no cake.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.425
No cake?
No cake.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.226
No cake?
No cake.

07:41.228 --> 07:45.263
If there's no cake,
then I can't hug you
and sing "happy birthday".

07:45.265 --> 07:46.031
Which works out well,

07:46.033 --> 07:49.601
'cause I'm also thinking
no song and... No you.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.636
Then I wouldn't be there.
Uh-huh.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.304
I have to be there.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.574
Look, starting
with this birthday,
everything changes.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.275
I'm like an adult now.
But...

07:57.277 --> 07:59.411
This is my special day.

07:59.413 --> 08:00.178
(sighs)
please, mama?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.880
Adult adam:
<i>I only pulled out the "mama"</i>

08:01.882 --> 08:03.348
<i>When it was</i>
<i>absolutely necessary,</i>

08:03.350 --> 08:07.219
<i>And when I did,</i>
<i>she was putty in my hands.</i>

08:07.221 --> 08:09.087
Okay, fine.

08:09.089 --> 08:14.693
Sad, boring, cakeless,
songless, momless
basement party it is.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.629
Adult adam:  <i>With my mother</i>
<i>successfully neutralized,</i>

08:17.631 --> 08:19.064
<i>My make-out bash was a go.</i>

08:19.066 --> 08:21.700
<i>I scored everything</i>
<i>on barry's sexy checklist,</i>

08:21.702 --> 08:24.069
<i>Right down to</i>
<i>the velour shirt.</i>

08:24.071 --> 08:26.571
And that last
smooth soul jam

08:26.573 --> 08:30.175
Was dedicated
to all you lovers
in the crowd.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.011
You know who you are.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.747
Why is he
nodding at us?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.282
No idea.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.718
Stop nodding at us!

08:39.720 --> 08:43.989
Adult adam:
<i>Turns out, make-out parties</i>
<i>are awesome in theory,</i>

08:43.991 --> 08:46.157
<i>But awkward in reality.</i>

08:46.159 --> 08:48.860
Next up is twister, y'all!

08:48.862 --> 08:49.494
Hope you stretched,

08:49.496 --> 08:53.798
'cause it's about to get
real bendy in here.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.536
So, um,
what happened to laser tag?

08:57.538 --> 09:00.539
I just thought
this might be more fun.

09:00.773 --> 09:01.873
Oyster?
Mmm.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.443
Soft cheese?
Oh, wow.
That's really stinky.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.078
You know it.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.648
(cheese thuds)
check this out.

09:10.082 --> 09:12.017
Moroccan pillow.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.120
Boop!

09:15.122 --> 09:18.089
Oh, it's hard.
Sorry.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.092
Adult adam:  <i>And with that,</i>
<i>the best night of my life</i>

09:21.094 --> 09:26.364
<i>Had officially become</i>
<i>a kissless, velour nightmare.</i>

09:26.566 --> 09:30.602
<i>Amazingly, my mom took</i>
<i>my momless party in stride.</i>

09:30.604 --> 09:31.269
This is madness.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.370
Adult adam:
<i>Or not.</i>

09:32.372 --> 09:34.673
I mean, what boy wants
a basement party?

09:34.675 --> 09:39.711
There's no pin the tail
on the donkey,
no balloons, no cake.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.712
You know what?
Screw it.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.815
Give me the phone book.
I'm calling a (bleep) clown.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.584
No! Stop!

09:45.586 --> 09:46.818
No clown.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.553
I know my son.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.789
He needs me down there.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.357
I can literally
feel him call me

09:52.359 --> 09:56.127
To bring him this festive
platter of bagel bites.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.829
You promised adam.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.532
I'll bring him
the stupid bagel bites.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.134
Gimme.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.135
You stay put.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.737
Adult adam:
<i>The last thing erica wanted</i>

10:05.739 --> 10:08.640
<i>Was for my overbearing</i>
<i>smother to ruin my party.</i>

10:08.642 --> 10:11.710
<i>But then she saw</i>
<i>the soft, pink</i>
<i>mood lighting...</i>

10:11.712 --> 10:14.813
<i>...And the gooey, sexy foods?</i>

10:14.815 --> 10:15.914
<i>And chachi!</i>

10:15.916 --> 10:19.351
<i>And just like that, my sister</i>
<i>went into full mom mode.</i>

10:19.353 --> 10:21.453
What the hell
is happening here?

10:21.455 --> 10:24.489
Looks like a love dungeon
in a serial killer's house.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.726
It's a make-out party,
and I got to say, bagel bites?

10:27.728 --> 10:29.694
Not sexy.
Get 'em out of here.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.963
'sup, erica?
Didn't know you'd be here.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.433
Okay, get your body
away from me, dave kim.

10:35.435 --> 10:39.738
Seriously?
This whole thing
is upsetting and wrong.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.672
And it has to stop
right now.

10:40.674 --> 10:44.442
Okay, this is all I could find
for spin the bottle,
but it's completely full.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.145
Barry to the rescue.
I'll take it down.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.813
My body loves calcium.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.416
Adult adam:
<i>That day, my brother</i>
<i>found out the hard way</i>

10:51.418 --> 10:54.252
<i>It's physically impossible</i>
<i>to drink that much milk.</i>

10:54.254 --> 10:57.122
(sighs)
is this from a cow?

10:57.124 --> 10:58.990
Why is it so hard?

11:01.560 --> 11:02.627
(exhales sharply)

11:02.629 --> 11:04.629
My body says no, but...

11:04.631 --> 11:07.599
I'm gonna do this
for you guys.

11:07.601 --> 11:08.867
Erica:
Are you kidding me?

11:08.869 --> 11:12.103
Spin the bottle,
mood lighting, and velour?

11:12.105 --> 11:12.704
This isn't you.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.372
Can we talk
about this later?

11:14.374 --> 11:17.676
You're kind of
giving off a...
Mom vibe.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.611
I am not mom!

11:19.613 --> 11:21.479
I will never be mom!

11:21.481 --> 11:22.247
Now,
take these bagel bites

11:22.249 --> 11:24.816
And blow on them
three times or they'll
scald your little mouth,

11:24.818 --> 11:26.685
And get away from me,
dave kim!

11:26.687 --> 11:31.022
Okay. I'm gonna need you
to leave my party.

11:31.457 --> 11:32.557
Oh!

11:32.559 --> 11:33.158
Oh, I'm leaving.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.795
I'll go up there
and tell mom all about
your creepy freak fest.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.196
Hold on.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.998
You win, okay?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.132
At least let me tell her.

11:41.134 --> 11:45.770
And it's just I thought I knew
what kind of party I wanted.

11:45.772 --> 11:46.771
(sighs)

11:46.773 --> 11:47.939
But I realize now...

11:47.941 --> 11:50.275
What is it, honey?
I really want a cake!

11:50.277 --> 11:52.110
Something that reminds me
of my childhood.

11:52.112 --> 11:56.848
It would make me so happy,
but now it's too late...

11:56.949 --> 11:58.850
Mama.
(pan clangs)

11:58.852 --> 11:59.884
Oh!

11:59.886 --> 12:00.518
Mama's here, baby.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.587
Mama's going to the store
right now.

12:02.589 --> 12:05.623
Mama will be back
in 20 minutes.

12:05.625 --> 12:06.958
Wait. Mom!

12:06.960 --> 12:08.126
Out of my way!

12:08.128 --> 12:09.260
I... I want bert and ernie!

12:09.262 --> 12:12.063
Anything
for my birthday boy.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.531
(door closes)

12:13.533 --> 12:15.500
Well, that was good.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.468
But you leave me no choice.

12:16.470 --> 12:19.337
When mom gets back,
I'm gonna tell her everything.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.338
Oh, I don't think so.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.575
Unless you want her
to hear what happened
at the winter formal.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.544
What?
And when you were
on that ski trip.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.580
What?
Three words...

12:28.582 --> 12:29.848
South padre island.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.684
What?
I have been the coolest
little brother in the world

12:32.686 --> 12:36.421
Until now.
You keep my secret,
I'll keep yours.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.456
Now, do we understand
each other?

12:38.458 --> 12:39.491
Yes!
Good.

12:39.493 --> 12:42.026
Adult adam:
<i>While my sister was trying</i>
<i>to figure out a way</i>

12:42.028 --> 12:42.594
<i>To end my party,</i>

12:42.596 --> 12:46.865
<i>Barry was doing all he could</i>
<i>to keep it chugging along.</i>

12:48.634 --> 12:49.434
Are you almost done?

12:49.436 --> 12:52.437
People are starting to lose
interest in spin the bottle.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.404
(sighs) I'm trying!

12:53.406 --> 12:54.939
Son of a bitch!
This thing is bottomless!

12:54.941 --> 12:57.275
(electronic gunfire)
<i>that bottle wasn't</i>
<i>the only thing bottomless.</i>

12:57.277 --> 12:59.377
Murray: Pew! Pew!
<i>Just then,</i>
<i>my dad decided to pick</i>

12:59.379 --> 13:03.348
<i>The worst moment to finally</i>
<i>give me my birthday gift.</i>

13:03.350 --> 13:05.316
Where's the man
of the hour?

13:05.318 --> 13:08.486
Dad, what the hell?
You're not wearing any pants!

13:08.488 --> 13:10.555
Oh, they know
how it works around here.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.323
Murray:
You notice anything else?

13:12.325 --> 13:13.725
(electronic gunfire)

13:13.727 --> 13:14.292
Laser tag!

13:14.294 --> 13:16.161
I bought a bunch
for you and your friends.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.730
Yeah. Great.
Now please leave.

13:18.732 --> 13:21.232
I just went and bought you

13:21.234 --> 13:23.535
The thing you wanted most
in the world.

13:23.537 --> 13:24.402
(electronic gunshot)

13:24.404 --> 13:26.304
You could at least
give me a thumbs-up,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.339
A thank-you,
a look of appreciation.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.242
Happy?
That's a fake smile,
and you know it.

13:31.244 --> 13:34.045
It's not a fake smile.
It's got teeth and everything.

13:34.047 --> 13:34.879
I hate that smile!

13:34.881 --> 13:37.749
I don't even like
laser tag, okay?

13:37.751 --> 13:39.717
Want to get me
a present?

13:39.719 --> 13:41.252
Go.

13:41.921 --> 13:45.123
<i>My dad finally bought me</i>
<i>a gift from the heart,</i>

13:45.125 --> 13:46.524
<i>And I flat-out rejected him.</i>

13:46.526 --> 13:48.993
<i>I was sacrificing everything</i>
<i>for that kiss,</i>

13:48.995 --> 13:51.329
<i>And nothing would stop me.</i>

13:51.331 --> 13:52.564
(gags)

13:52.566 --> 13:54.199
Hah! Hah! It burns!

13:54.201 --> 13:56.434
(sighs)
can I get some milk?

13:56.535 --> 13:58.002
(exhales sharply)

13:58.004 --> 13:59.470
Seriously!

13:59.472 --> 14:00.638
Now you ask me?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.140
You're unb...
(belches)

14:02.142 --> 14:05.643
I got to go.
I got to go.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.881
<i>I had neutralized erica</i>
<i>with threats</i>

14:09.883 --> 14:10.815
<i>And my mother with cake,</i>

14:10.817 --> 14:14.385
<i>But I knew that wasn't gonna</i>
<i>hold them off forever.</i>

14:14.387 --> 14:15.153
Is the cake ready yet?

14:15.155 --> 14:17.655
I mean, how much more baking
do you need to do already?

14:17.657 --> 14:20.792
Get off my back, erica.
I'm a mother,
not a pastry chef.

14:20.794 --> 14:23.361
Beverly: Ugh.
This looks like "sloth"
from "the goonies".

14:23.363 --> 14:27.699
Why is it so hard
to make an oblong bert head?

14:27.701 --> 14:30.001
No, no, no, no!
Don't start over!

14:30.003 --> 14:32.570
(scoffs) just go
downstairs right now

14:32.572 --> 14:34.405
And see
what's going on, okay?

14:34.407 --> 14:35.707
No, I can't barge in.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.308
What do you mean
you can't barge in?

14:37.310 --> 14:38.176
That's all you do!

14:38.178 --> 14:40.945
I finally made
some headway with adam.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.580
He asked for a cake.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.348
If I play my cards right,

14:43.350 --> 14:47.185
I can get some huggies
when we sing "happy birthday"!
(chuckles)

14:47.187 --> 14:50.121
Mom, do you remember
the time that you snuck
in the basement

14:50.123 --> 14:51.289
And spied
on me and lainey

14:51.291 --> 14:52.824
Drinking mango madness
wine coolers

14:52.826 --> 14:54.859
And then grounded me
for two months?

14:54.861 --> 14:55.727
Yes.
That was a good day.

14:55.729 --> 14:59.330
Okay, well,
I need you to go downstairs.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.999
And just in case
adam does mention

15:01.001 --> 15:04.569
Something about
south padre island,
he's a liar.

15:05.938 --> 15:06.504
And I'm sorry.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.240
Adult adam:
<i>While my meddling</i>
<i>smother plotted her next move,</i>

15:09.242 --> 15:12.844
<i>The plot thickened</i>
<i>outside al capone's vault.</i>

15:12.846 --> 15:14.612
Geraldo rivera:
<i>...The real secret tunnel.</i>

15:14.614 --> 15:15.346
I can't believe it.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.783
That little moron ruined
al capone's vault for me.

15:18.785 --> 15:19.517
Stop it, murray.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.420
In 10 minutes,
he's gonna blow open
that vault

15:22.422 --> 15:25.223
And with it,
our minds.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.491
How am I supposed
to enjoy it?

15:26.493 --> 15:28.526
I don't buy adam a gift,
he's pissed at me.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.995
I buy him a gift,
he's even more pissed at me.

15:30.997 --> 15:31.562
I can't win.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.665
Erica: Our baby grew up
so fast, didn't he?

15:33.667 --> 15:37.502
It's, like, one minute,
he's this little,
four-eyed dork.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.570
Then you blink,
and he's a man.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.140
A man with needs.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.408
What's happening?

15:43.410 --> 15:46.911
I miss that little lovebug.
That's what's happening.

15:46.913 --> 15:47.845
Oh, my god.
I am mom!

15:47.847 --> 15:51.316
You are, and I got
to tell you,
it's a real downer.

15:51.318 --> 15:54.585
You know how many gifts
my dad bought me growing up?

15:54.587 --> 15:55.119
Zero.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.355
That's all I got
from that man... Nothing.

15:57.357 --> 16:00.058
Do you think it hurt?
Damn right, it hurt.

16:00.060 --> 16:00.758
Oh, my god!

16:00.760 --> 16:03.127
Why are you coming to terms
with this now?

16:03.129 --> 16:04.762
They're about to blow
the safe!

16:04.764 --> 16:07.565
See, that's why
I don't give gifts.
It's all a sham.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.734
I wish we could
just stop time, you know?

16:09.736 --> 16:12.270
And keep him our
special, little boy forever.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.138
Okay. That's it.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.007
I'm watching tv upstairs.

16:16.009 --> 16:16.908
No one follow me.

16:16.910 --> 16:19.777
Adult adam:
<i>While my dad and sister</i>
<i>were having a breakdown,</i>

16:19.779 --> 16:23.548
<i>My mom</i>
<i>was plotting a break-in.</i>

16:23.983 --> 16:28.987
<i>My god, she was like a silent,</i>
<i>manicured, nosy ninja.</i>

16:31.190 --> 16:31.990
Smooth move, adam.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.158
It's not my fault.
It's too big a bottle.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.060
It's meant for milk,
not spinning.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.029
Maybe
we should just go.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.831
No!
(chuckles nervously)

16:39.833 --> 16:40.698
Don't go.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.301
How about, uh,
seven minutes in heaven?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.202
Girl: Yeah.
Boy: Yeah.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.838
It's your birthday, dude,
so you pick first.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.873
<i>This kiss</i>
<i>was my al capone's vault.</i>

16:48.875 --> 16:54.278
<i>The buildup was excruciating,</i>
<i>and it was finally time</i>
<i>to get it over with.</i>

16:54.747 --> 16:56.748
Dana, I guess?

16:56.750 --> 16:57.715
Um... Okay.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.718
<i>Even though</i>
<i>my big moment was here,</i>

17:00.720 --> 17:01.419
<i>I was blissfully unaware</i>

17:01.421 --> 17:05.723
<i>That the other woman</i>
<i>in my life</i>
<i>had crashed my party.</i>

17:11.330 --> 17:13.364
(beeping)

17:16.235 --> 17:17.468
Are you playing pac-man?

17:17.470 --> 17:19.337
No, I... I'm trying
to set the timer.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.406
The directions
are in japanese.

17:21.408 --> 17:24.242
It's very complicated.
Oh.

17:25.110 --> 17:26.411
There we go.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.679
We're on the clock.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.150
Are you sweating?

17:32.152 --> 17:34.919
It's the velour shirt.
It doesn't breathe.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.188
It reminds me
of my nana's robe.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.890
(chuckles)

17:39.958 --> 17:43.561
Adam: So...
We got 6:38 left.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.595
What are you thinking?

17:44.597 --> 17:48.266
I guess we could, um,
you know.

17:49.768 --> 17:53.304
Okay. Let's...
You know.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.473
(beverly snorting)

17:55.475 --> 17:56.541
What's wrong?

17:56.543 --> 17:58.342
Me?
I thought that was you.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.078
Uh...

18:02.114 --> 18:02.980
Hi, poopie.

18:02.982 --> 18:03.681
Oh, my god.
Hey, dana.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.784
Oh, my god!
Wow.
That is an adorable dress.

18:06.786 --> 18:07.385
(gasps)

18:07.387 --> 18:09.320
I was just seeing
if the ski boots

18:09.322 --> 18:11.823
Were all where
they're supposed to be,
and, uh

18:11.825 --> 18:14.559
(clicks tongue)
they are.

18:16.295 --> 18:16.661
Dana!

18:16.663 --> 18:18.262
I don't want to talk
to you.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.130
Wait.
Just give me a sec.

18:19.132 --> 18:21.265
Your mom was in
our seven minutes in heaven!

18:21.267 --> 18:24.302
I'm sorry. This whole thing
has been a complete disaster.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.937
Why'd you even throw
this stupid party?

18:25.939 --> 18:27.472
What was wrong
with laser tag?

18:27.474 --> 18:29.507
Nothing!
I love laser tag.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.677
Then why didn't
we just play laser tag?

18:32.679 --> 18:33.444
You big idiot.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.546
<i>(just like heaven</i> playing)

18:35.548 --> 18:38.749
You're right.
I am an idiot.

18:39.384 --> 18:41.652
Let's just play laser tag.

18:41.654 --> 18:42.653
(electronic gunfire)

18:42.655 --> 18:43.554
(children shouting playfully)

18:43.556 --> 18:46.858
<i>That night, my worst birthday</i>
<i>ever became the best.</i>

18:46.860 --> 18:48.326
<i>Yeah, we all wanted</i>
<i>that first kiss,</i>

18:48.328 --> 18:49.460
<i>But for one more night,</i>

18:49.462 --> 18:53.164
<i>We were all happy</i>
<i>to keep on being kids.</i>

18:53.832 --> 18:55.900
What a little dork.

18:56.268 --> 18:57.702
Thank god.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.703
Dad!

18:58.705 --> 19:00.304
(electronic gunshot)

19:00.306 --> 19:01.239
Best gift ever!

19:01.241 --> 19:02.840
Albert:
See that smile?

19:02.842 --> 19:06.444
That's it!
That's the look!

19:06.446 --> 19:10.248
Come on. Let's go see
that handsome devil
open that vault.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.817
Oh, just tell me
what happens.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.585
(electronic gunfire)

19:14.587 --> 19:16.687
(music continues)

19:17.990 --> 19:19.724
<i>It seems,</i>
<i>at least up to now,</i>

19:19.726 --> 19:20.892
<i>That we've struck out</i>
<i>with the vault.</i>

19:20.894 --> 19:22.927
<i>I'm disappointed about that,</i>
<i>as I'm sure you are.</i>

19:22.929 --> 19:26.197
Adult adam:  <i>Turns out,</i>
<i>al capone's vault was empty.</i>

19:26.199 --> 19:29.000
<i>All that buildup</i>
<i>and no payoff.</i>

19:29.002 --> 19:32.036
Poor mustachioed bastard.

19:34.039 --> 19:34.572
Hi.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.307
We're just taking
a break.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.742
Oh. I just finished
the cake.

19:37.744 --> 19:41.078
It's terrible, isn't it?
I should just start over.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.281
No! I love it.

19:43.482 --> 19:48.119
Let's eat.
Happy birthday,
snuggle monster.

19:49.588 --> 19:50.688
Thanks, mama.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.691
<i>♪ you're just like a dream</i>

19:53.693 --> 19:56.627
<i>♪ you're just like a dream</i>

19:56.629 --> 19:58.062
There's too many of them.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.665
You run, I'll cover you.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.634
(electronic gunfire)

20:03.636 --> 20:05.336
Gotcha!

20:05.338 --> 20:07.471
(distorted) no!

20:07.473 --> 20:09.840
(electronic warbling)

20:10.542 --> 20:12.076
You saved me.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.878
I... Guess I did.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.480
<i>♪ I opened up my eyes</i>

20:16.815 --> 20:19.417
<i>♪ I found myself alone, alone</i>

20:19.419 --> 20:22.119
<i>♪ alone above a raging sea</i>

20:22.121 --> 20:26.424
<i>♪ that stole</i>
<i>the only girl I loved</i>

20:26.426 --> 20:27.124
<i>♪ and drowned her...</i>

20:27.126 --> 20:29.026
Adult adam:  <i>Even though</i>
<i>al capone's vault may have</i>
<i>been a complete letdown,</i>

20:29.028 --> 20:34.131
<i>Some things in life</i>
<i>are as amazing</i>
<i>as you'd hoped they'd be.</i>

20:39.504 --> 20:40.938
(ding)

20:41.206 --> 20:43.241
(ding)

20:43.675 --> 20:45.243
Adam:
Who should I kiss?

20:45.245 --> 20:46.477
Boy: Come on, adam!

20:46.479 --> 20:48.913
She's not
gonna let me kiss...

20:49.748 --> 20:50.681
Okay.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.650
As student council
treasurer,

20:52.652 --> 20:54.352
We should
go over the budget first,

20:54.354 --> 20:56.020
And then, if we have time,
talk bake sale.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.189
Why exactly
are we meeting down here?

20:58.191 --> 20:59.457
No reason.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.626
Soft cheese? Oyster?

21:01.628 --> 21:03.160
Not you, sanjeev.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.629
Let's begin, shall we?

21:04.631 --> 21:06.364
Unfortunately,
there's no chairs,

21:06.366 --> 21:10.101
So we're gonna have to sit
in a circle on the floor.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.704
Oh! Look!

21:13.706 --> 21:16.774
A bottle!
Here's a crazy idea.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.376
Spin the bottle!

21:18.378 --> 21:20.378
I'll go first.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.182
Bagel bites?
