Now get us out of here.

-Working on it.

These buildings have lasers.

[Tony] I know!

Isn’t this guy your old employee?
How did you make him so mad?

01:26.044 --> 01:28.546
Hey, I treat all my workers
with the utmost respect.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.340
Really?! When I worked with you,

01:30.423 --> 01:33.009
you lied to me and
used me to try to take over the world.

01:33.092 --> 01:35.637
Yeah, but I said
"please" and "thank you" a lot.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.718
Nice jump, Toretto, but I think
the landing could have been softer.

02:16.386 --> 02:20.140
-Ugh, can you just stop talking?!
-Ease up, it's a joke.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.893
I don't get it.
You saved my life, but you still hate me?

02:23.977 --> 02:25.270
Yeah, exactly.

02:25.353 --> 02:30.066
You know, I learned in prison
that kind of turmoil can eat you alive.

[Gary grunts] Guys, we're gonna need you
to reel in that car, quick.

Maybe you two could focus on
keeping this plane a little steadier?

03:12.317 --> 03:16.195
Hey, that's not as easy as you think.
We're dealing with laser cannons up here.

[dramatic music plays]

03:26.664 --> 03:30.084

This isn't you!

-No, Tony, don't ask!

You see, there's a famous book
by beloved author Herman Melville…

04:02.116 --> 04:03.701
Oh, here we go…

04:03.785 --> 04:06.371
…about a certain Captain Ahab.

04:06.454 --> 04:09.082
Tony, you're my white whale!

[dramatic music plays]

04:33.439 --> 04:34.983
It's in. Hit the door.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.490
So this is the secret weapon
Sudarikov has been working on?

04:43.157 --> 04:45.285
Pretty cool, as far as secret weapons go.

take us out!

05:05.555 --> 05:07.307
[dramatic music plays]

05:08.891 --> 05:10.435

05:32.749 --> 05:34.959
We kept getting attacked
by dudes on motorcycles,

05:35.043 --> 05:37.795
and I thought to myself,
"There's got to be a better way."

05:37.879 --> 05:41.090
That's a great infomercial and all,
but maybe just get us out of here?

Right.

But I'm better.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.402
Are you both serious?!

06:01.486 --> 06:03.988
There's someone literally
trying to run us off the road,

06:04.072 --> 06:06.407
and you two babies
are worried about a palmetto bug!

06:06.491 --> 06:09.327
I think I felt it!
It's on me, isn't it?! Get it off!

06:09.410 --> 06:13.539
It's not on you! And it's just a bug,
with some little legs and antennas.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.834
Ah! Stop describing it. It's like
I can feel it crawling up my back.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.295
Ugh. Fine. Let me just…

06:39.690 --> 06:42.068
Guys, maybe this car's not so bad.

06:42.151 --> 06:44.862
Maybe it's like that kitten
I found in my engine that time.

You're talking about Little Big Block?

06:47.031 --> 06:49.742
Yeah. Little Big Block
didn't want to hurt anyone!

06:49.826 --> 06:51.994
Right? Little Big Block was just worried,

06:52.078 --> 06:54.789
and needed someone to tell him
it was all gonna be okay.

I think my thing is
a little more important than your thing.

-Would you just focus on cutting the line?

08:28.466 --> 08:29.550
I got a better idea.

08:29.634 --> 08:32.595
The way to get Rusty to stop chasing us

That won't happen.

I'm just saying there's a possibility.
You don't want to underestimate Sudarikov.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.955
He got to me, and he made
an AI car that drove like you.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.040
I'm just saying,
he's better than you think.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.250
Wait. What did you say?

12:31.333 --> 12:34.253
-I said, he's better than you think.
-No, about the car.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.172
It drove like you, Toretto.

If I didn't know better, I'd have guessed
you were behind the wheel.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.760
That's why Sudarikov took you
in the first place.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.096
-What?
-Sudarikov captured me.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.639
He hooked me up to some machine,

and had me driving
in these crazy simulated scenarios.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.645
I didn't know why, but I guess
he was downloading my driving abilities.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.898
He must be using that
to create his AI car!

12:53.981 --> 12:57.318
You're saying that car's AI software
is created from you?

12:57.401 --> 13:00.029
Yes, he's making an evil me! In car form!

13:00.696 --> 13:04.325
That's messed up. Also, I think
I would have made a better evil car.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.785
-[scoffs]
-Just saying. You're soft.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.497
I can't believe Sudarikov's
going to use my driving skills

13:09.580 --> 13:10.789
for some warped evil plan.

13:10.873 --> 13:14.210
That's it! Forget waiting,
we need to stop Sudarikov now.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.795
-We'll attack Rusty and get some answers.
-[Shashi] Yup.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.591
That sounds just like a Toretto plan:
jumping in headfirst and blind.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.092
You have a better idea?

13:22.176 --> 13:25.429
-Yes. We wait for your team.
-What do you know about teams?

13:25.513 --> 13:27.932
Tony, calm down.
Shashi's right on this one.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.143
-Really? You're siding with him?
-Dude, I thought we were friends.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.438
I'm not siding with anyone.
I'm just saying what I think is best.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.107
Siding! This is Shashi
we're talking about, okay?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.693
Whatever he suggests,
we should do the opposite.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.071
[Shashi] You realize
I can totally hear you?

13:42.154 --> 13:45.616
Tony, you're being unreasonable.
I'm just gonna go ahead and chalk it up to

13:45.699 --> 13:48.118
a bad guy making
an evil weapon out of your…

13:48.202 --> 13:49.328
mind, I guess?

13:49.411 --> 13:51.455
Or, maybe Tony's just jealous.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.665
Shashi, don't.

13:53.249 --> 13:57.086
What? I'm just the bad guy anyway.
Might as well tell it like I see it.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.422
You're jealous because Layla's got
a special place in her heart for me

14:00.506 --> 14:02.091
and you're still on the outside.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.052
Zip it, Shashi!
He's just trying to rile you up.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.428
[forced laugh]

14:06.512 --> 14:10.349
Well, I guess he doesn't know
that it's impossible to rile me up.

14:10.432 --> 14:13.852
I'm so un-rile-able, it's not even funny.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.813
Okay. He did it.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.482
He didn't do anything, okay?
And I'm not jealous.

14:18.566 --> 14:23.237
And it's crazy if you think that what
he says is true, because, ha-ha, it's not.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.115
-[car door slams]
-Happy now?

14:31.287 --> 14:33.247
Any luck contacting Toretto?

14:33.330 --> 14:34.832
Nope. Any luck with the car?

14:34.915 --> 14:35.749
Nope.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.168
That's because it's not mechanical.

14:38.252 --> 14:41.964
Guys, I've been trying to tell you - if we
want to find out more about this car,

14:42.047 --> 14:44.216
we need to look into its digital brain.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.969
Look into its brain?
Uh-uh. That sounds gross.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.512
I am not good with brains.

14:48.596 --> 14:52.308
What I mean is, we need to
run diagnostics on the software.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.560
Bro, to do that, we gotta power the car,

14:54.643 --> 14:58.230
but we can't do that,
'cause the car wants to kill us.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.857
Kill us!

15:00.774 --> 15:02.818
Actually, maybe there is a way.

15:03.861 --> 15:04.904
[tense music plays]

15:04.987 --> 15:05.905
Alright.

15:05.988 --> 15:10.034
All the weapons have been disabled,
and it's not going anywhere.

15:10.117 --> 15:10.951

15:24.298 --> 15:26.258
Huh, this is strange.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.802
Something's going on
with the embedded code.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.220
Strange how?

15:30.304 --> 15:32.431
I don't know. It could be an anomaly.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.768
Or it could be a hidden virus.
Kill the battery, Cisco.

-I'm not pouting!
-Right…

16:07.841 --> 16:10.678
You know Shashi was just trying to
make you upset back there.

16:10.761 --> 16:11.679
That's what he does.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.931
-It's not like what he said was true.
-Yeah!

16:14.014 --> 16:16.392
It's crazy to think that
I would be jealous of him.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.893
[Layla] That's what I'm saying.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.771

or something. [scoffs]
