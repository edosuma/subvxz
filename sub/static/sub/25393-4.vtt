33:57.078 --> 33:58.204
I love you.

34:03.251 --> 34:04.627
But I don't love you.

34:05.837 --> 34:07.213
(CHUCKLES)

34:09.132 --> 34:10.132
Yeah.

34:19.308 --> 34:20.935
Can I just say one last thing?

34:39.661 --> 34:41.164
We should've gone to Bimini.

34:41.539 --> 34:42.748
(CHUCKLES)

35:07.982 --> 35:10.526
BUS DRIVER: Next stop, New Orleans.

35:10.777 --> 35:13.321
(ENGINE STARTS)

35:23.831 --> 35:25.291
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

35:26.751 --> 35:28.544
The hell are you doing?
I told you to get out of here!

35:28.628 --> 35:31.172
You're a mean son of a bitch,
Jesse Custer.

35:31.714 --> 35:33.132
But you ain't that mean.

35:33.216 --> 35:34.634
- What're you talking about?
- Don't lie to me!

35:36.969 --> 35:38.679
What you did down there to Cassidy,

35:39.472 --> 35:41.933
that was pretend mean,
like fake mean.

35:42.016 --> 35:43.100
You don't know what you're saying.

35:43.184 --> 35:44.811
To protect him from this shit-hole.

35:45.728 --> 35:49.148
Like you were protecting Madame Boyd
when you dumped her sorry ass.

35:50.107 --> 35:51.776
How you know about Sabina?

35:52.026 --> 35:53.110
It doesn't matter.

35:54.570 --> 35:57.573
What matters is,
I don't need protecting.

35:59.075 --> 36:01.786
What I need is a goddamn boyfriend
who levels with me.

36:03.830 --> 36:05.957
I'm tired of doubting you, Jesse.

36:07.083 --> 36:10.294
And I'm really tired of you
not trusting me with shit.

36:12.129 --> 36:14.173
Now do you want us to be good again?

36:14.924 --> 36:16.008
Hmm?

36:16.634 --> 36:17.927
Is that what you want?

36:19.637 --> 36:20.638
Well, is it?

36:25.142 --> 36:26.269
What happened to Kenny?

36:26.352 --> 36:29.063
KENNY: <i>I'll fight!
I'll fight you, L'Angelle!</i>

36:31.315 --> 36:33.484
(CROWD CHEERING)

36:33.985 --> 36:35.778
(BOTH GRUNTING)

36:36.237 --> 36:37.280
(GASPING)

36:40.449 --> 36:43.411
Kenny. Kenny, please stop!

36:43.995 --> 36:47.290
Kenny! Kenny, please, stop!

36:48.624 --> 36:50.042
(KENNY GRUNTING)

36:56.382 --> 36:57.383
Kenny.

37:00.636 --> 37:02.430
Kenny, please stop. Stop!

37:06.934 --> 37:08.352
(SCREAMS)

37:17.820 --> 37:18.821
Kenny.

37:20.031 --> 37:21.949
Kenny. Kenny. (BREATHING HEAVILY)

37:27.330 --> 37:30.082
Are you not entertained?

37:30.416 --> 37:31.792
(CROWD CHEERING)

37:33.419 --> 37:35.546
Man, this place sucks.

37:37.340 --> 37:38.466
You just wait.

37:39.967 --> 37:41.218
Oh, I will.

37:42.219 --> 37:43.429
Damn right.

37:48.935 --> 37:51.687
So, we're good again?

37:53.898 --> 37:55.733
Only one way to find out.

38:04.408 --> 38:05.409
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

38:08.412 --> 38:10.414
- Shit, your ex-girlfriend.
- Huh?

38:11.499 --> 38:13.000
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

38:13.876 --> 38:14.961
(SIGHS)

38:27.765 --> 38:28.766
Sorry about that.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.601
Got busy.

38:31.227 --> 38:32.228
Where are they?

38:32.561 --> 38:33.562
Who?

38:33.646 --> 38:36.482
Your boys know I took you.
And they can damn sure guess where.

38:36.565 --> 38:38.317
So, why aren't they
shooting this place up? Huh?

38:38.776 --> 38:41.028
I called them.
I told them not to come.

38:44.991 --> 38:46.867
So, you can break it.

38:47.660 --> 38:49.745
No. But you can.

38:50.538 --> 38:53.040
Oh, right, my wand?
From graduating Hogwarts?

38:53.124 --> 38:55.418
Mmm-hmm. Totally forgot I had that.

38:55.501 --> 38:57.044
You wanna get rid
of a spell like this,

38:57.128 --> 38:59.463
all you gotta do is get rid
of the person who cast it.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.467
Yeah, and then what?

39:03.801 --> 39:06.303
That's it. The spell's broken.

39:08.514 --> 39:09.640
Uh-uh.

39:09.849 --> 39:13.686
No, then there's some boomerangy,
"Gotcha, sucker" twist happens

39:13.769 --> 39:15.813
and Jesse's head falls off
or something.

39:16.063 --> 39:19.066
Nothing will happen to Jesse.
I promise.

39:20.317 --> 39:22.361
You been burning
my ears off all night

39:22.445 --> 39:26.073
with how much you hate him.
Why should I trust you?

39:26.490 --> 39:28.617
Because as much as I hate Jesse,

39:29.160 --> 39:32.288
there's one person in this world
I hate even more.

39:33.998 --> 39:35.583
It's simple.

39:35.666 --> 39:37.084
You want Jesse out of here?

39:38.461 --> 39:40.254
Kill his grandma.

39:49.430 --> 39:50.431
(GRUNTS)

(SATAN LAUGHS)

39:55.603 --> 39:56.645
That'll do.

39:58.856 --> 40:00.357
(PANTING)

40:00.608 --> 40:02.151
As advertised.

40:02.443 --> 40:04.028
What a son of a bitch.

40:04.862 --> 40:06.405
He didn't scream once, did he?

40:08.866 --> 40:12.161
Well, now that we got
the formalities out of the way,

40:12.328 --> 40:14.663
let's talk. You first.

40:17.249 --> 40:18.626
A preacher.

40:19.001 --> 40:20.544
This guy!

40:21.003 --> 40:22.213
Such a self-starter.

40:22.296 --> 40:23.756
You could learn something, Sidney.

40:25.508 --> 40:31.764
Preacher, that is normally
kind of a no-fly zone with me.

40:34.892 --> 40:37.478
But these are not normal times.

40:38.479 --> 40:41.607
I need you to go back up

40:41.690 --> 40:44.985
and bring someone
back on down to me.

40:46.028 --> 40:47.029
Actually,

40:48.197 --> 40:49.990
two someones.

40:51.992 --> 40:54.370
Now, these two someones,

40:54.453 --> 40:57.331
for, uh, nuanced reasons
I'm not going into right now,

40:57.414 --> 41:01.043
are threatening my big,
beautiful expansion plans.

41:01.585 --> 41:03.003
So, I thought of you.

41:04.046 --> 41:05.172
My weapon?

41:05.339 --> 41:06.590
No, no, no.

41:06.674 --> 41:09.677
We can't have you shooting up
cops and hotels on this one.

41:10.052 --> 41:12.221
I need 'em back alive.

41:12.763 --> 41:14.473
And if you can do that,

41:15.683 --> 41:17.309
you can have your guns back.

41:19.687 --> 41:23.566
And then you can kill
all the preachers you want.
