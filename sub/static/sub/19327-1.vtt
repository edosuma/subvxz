Are you ever going to
pay the rent?

03:59.782 --> 04:02.326
Pay the overdue rent by tomorrow

Will leave, don't worry!

06:18.546 --> 06:19.922
He must be seriously injured.

06:20.006 --> 06:21.799
Aren't we supposed to call the police?

Look who's here!

07:46.342 --> 07:50.513
You suddenly look great!

07:50.596 --> 07:51.722
Ma'am.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.892
Take this.
Overdue rent.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.437
- And there's more.
- What?

07:59.105 --> 08:02.358
Take this and leave me in peace.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.194
- At least for a couple months.
- Sure, I will.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.363
Keep the change for some noodle.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.448
You like that.

08:10.741 --> 08:11.450
Sure.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.494
You should treat us big!

08:23.504 --> 08:25.172
How can I start this?

08:28.843 --> 08:30.011
It sounds exquisite.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.265
For the delayed debts.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.433
Any smaller bills?

08:36.600 --> 08:37.643
Keep the change.

08:37.684 --> 08:38.727
What's up with you?

08:39.937 --> 08:40.895
This will pay off, right?

08:41.105 --> 08:42.898
I'm sorry to pay you late.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.193
- Bye!
- Hey.

08:53.868 --> 08:55.036
Yoon Jae-sung!

08:55.828 --> 08:58.497
What are you doing here?
It's been a while.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.916
- How have you been?
- Good.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.210
Haven't met you
since our theatre was closed.

09:04.128 --> 09:05.129
How are you?

09:05.296 --> 09:06.881
Okay...

09:08.591 --> 09:10.259
Right!

09:12.344 --> 09:14.096
It's the money that I borrowed then.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.725
Hey, you don't have to pay back.

09:17.933 --> 09:20.061
I just... want to.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.355
Jae-sung.

09:23.898 --> 09:25.566
I'm getting married next month.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.570
- What? Really?
- Yes.

09:32.573 --> 09:33.616
Gosh...

09:34.450 --> 09:36.327
I mean it's great.

09:41.916 --> 09:43.375
<i>Yoon Jae-sung.</i>

09:44.335 --> 09:45.419
<i>Wake up.</i>

09:54.220 --> 09:56.347
<i>This can't change your life.</i>

09:58.349 --> 09:59.975
<i>It doesn't belong to you.</i>

10:03.020 --> 10:04.063
<i>Give it back.</i>

10:05.523 --> 10:08.067
<i>Just give it back to him</i>

10:10.528 --> 10:12.113
<i>and put an end to it.</i>

11:03.914 --> 11:04.957
Yoon Jae-sung!

11:05.791 --> 11:07.042
Ye...yes?

11:07.293 --> 11:09.461
They said that's my name.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.672
I just can't recall it.

11:12.756 --> 11:13.757
Do you...

11:14.884 --> 11:16.510
know me by any chance?

11:17.469 --> 11:18.596
No.

11:19.763 --> 11:20.806
I...

11:21.724 --> 11:23.809
came here to see my friend.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.147
Get well soon.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.106
Wait.

11:29.315 --> 11:30.024
Yes?

11:31.150 --> 11:32.651
You forgot this.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.115
Thank you.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.421
I only have 2 bucks in my wallet.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.840
- No credit cards?
- No.

11:56.592 --> 11:57.384
Sir.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.304
Are you leaving now?

12:01.055 --> 12:02.056
Do you know me?

12:02.056 --> 12:05.517
I brought you here.
You slipped in the public bath.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.770
Did I slip at the public bath?

12:07.770 --> 12:11.023
This morning.
Don't you remember?

12:11.649 --> 12:14.276
- He has amnesia.
- Amnesia...

12:16.570 --> 12:18.280
How much do you remember?

12:18.614 --> 12:20.074
Can you find the way back home?

12:20.241 --> 12:21.659
Aren't you going to pay?

12:22.868 --> 12:24.828
Can I pay later?
Of course, not.

12:28.082 --> 12:30.834
Sorry to ask a favor to a stranger...

12:30.834 --> 12:31.252
Yes?

12:31.502 --> 12:33.462
This is where I live.

12:33.462 --> 12:35.923
I will pay you back as soon as
I find the cash at home.

12:36.799 --> 12:40.177
Could you please pay for me?
I'm really sorry.

12:40.761 --> 12:41.804
Well...

12:43.472 --> 12:45.057
Okay, no problem.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.643
Thank you. This is my address.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.188
- How much is it?
- 900 dollars.

12:51.188 --> 12:51.814
What?

12:54.483 --> 12:55.943
I will pay with a card.

13:02.032 --> 13:05.911
<i>I just can't recall it.
Do you know me by any chance?</i>

13:06.912 --> 13:09.123
<i>GPS is operating.
Drive safe.</i>

13:09.123 --> 13:10.708
<i>HOME</i>

13:11.208 --> 13:14.169
<i>What shall I do?
I should give this back.</i>

13:19.550 --> 13:21.844
Do you remember your name?

13:25.306 --> 13:27.016
Yoon Jae-sung.

13:28.267 --> 13:29.643
Yoon Jae-sung.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.230
How about your age?

13:37.401 --> 13:38.902
That's...

13:42.323 --> 13:44.533
It's so hard to read...

13:45.159 --> 13:46.493
What is it?

13:48.287 --> 13:49.413
I am thirty-two.

13:50.998 --> 13:51.790
What?

13:52.082 --> 13:52.833
Really?

13:54.877 --> 13:56.879
Thirty...two?

13:57.254 --> 13:58.130
Yes, here.

13:59.173 --> 14:01.759
- Born in 1984.
- Unbelievable.

14:02.301 --> 14:03.802
I'm 32 years old.

14:05.596 --> 14:10.142
Then we are of an age.

14:10.434 --> 14:13.062
Do I look like 32 years old?

14:13.437 --> 14:14.188
Excuse me?

14:15.731 --> 14:17.983
- I certainly do not.
- I am sorry.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.361
But my ID says so...

14:22.988 --> 14:26.575
Well there are people like you.

14:26.784 --> 14:28.786
You will look young
when you get older.

14:31.497 --> 14:32.956
That really relieves me.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.717
<i>Does he live here?</i>

14:51.058 --> 14:52.059
Hello.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.022
Excuse me.

15:01.527 --> 15:04.113
I came with the belongings of the owner

15:04.113 --> 15:06.156
as he seems to have amnesia...

15:07.324 --> 15:09.410
Wow, this place is...

15:10.536 --> 15:11.662
literally a palace.

15:13.038 --> 15:14.206
What's this place?

15:18.001 --> 15:20.170
A dressing room is
as big as my entire place.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.142
Police?

15:40.649 --> 15:42.693
What does he do with
all these raincoats?

15:42.901 --> 15:44.611
What is his job?

15:47.489 --> 15:48.991
Is it where you live?

15:52.161 --> 15:53.579
It really stinks.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.209
Remember anything?

16:02.296 --> 16:03.130
No.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.551
Not a clue.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.190
No chance of getting my money.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.613
These burnt photos...

16:27.613 --> 16:30.365
I guess
I was settling my affairs.

16:31.033 --> 16:31.867
What?

16:32.618 --> 16:34.786
It seems like I tried to
kill myself but failed.

16:35.454 --> 16:36.455
No way...

16:49.384 --> 16:50.802
<i>Vehicle 24, vehicle 24.</i>

16:51.303 --> 16:52.262

<i>- Calling for locked up doors.</i>
- Be right there!

16:57.434 --> 17:00.771
Just try to relax.
You can pay me back later!

17:01.396 --> 17:03.607
You shouldn't do such things again...

17:04.441 --> 17:05.526
Don't try too hard

17:05.943 --> 17:07.861
to remember things.
Take some rest for now.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.488
Thank you.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.328
Why did I try to die?

17:20.415 --> 17:22.125
Well, I can see why.

17:25.878 --> 17:26.922
It's nice.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.883
This is what you call 'life'.

17:49.570 --> 17:52.864
Isn't this TV?
Weird program it's showing.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.285
Is it showing a CCTV?

17:56.368 --> 17:57.828
She's so pretty.

I won't go to church.
I'm a Buddhist.

- Me, too. But listen...

so many cigarette butts.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.711
What are things you like?

22:17.212 --> 22:18.880
Certainly not smoking.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.258
I seem to like cleaning a lot.

22:21.925 --> 22:22.926
Cleaning.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.762
Wow! You cleared all the mess!

22:26.680 --> 22:28.890
Cleaning gives me inner peace.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.935
Then things you're good at?

22:31.935 --> 22:33.979
I seem to be good at
handling a knife.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.564
- A knife?
- Yes.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.025
Knife... cleaning.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.988
Are you busy with something?

22:43.196 --> 22:44.948
No, not particularly.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.284
- Come with me.
- Where?

22:47.534 --> 22:48.910
Just come.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.662
Where are you taking me?

22:50.662 --> 22:53.999
- A place you need to go.
- I should clean that up.

22:55.584 --> 22:58.795
- Thirty-two?
- Right, born in 1984.

23:02.007 --> 23:04.426
Gosh, he seems to be of my age.

23:04.634 --> 23:07.971
Listen, mom. He's good at
cleaning and handling a knife.

23:08.346 --> 23:09.890
The perfect fit for our store.

23:09.890 --> 23:12.475
We don't need an extra hand!
Mom and I can handle perfectly!

23:12.559 --> 23:15.061
What you have to do
is study not work!

23:16.688 --> 23:20.609
A male employee can be
really useful... to carry heavy things

23:21.693 --> 23:22.903
and to change the bulbs etc.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.906
And when a drunken customer
comes in like the other time...

23:25.906 --> 23:27.574
I can change the bulbs.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.951
Don't be ridiculous.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.162
No heavy lifting needed
at the snack house!

23:32.746 --> 23:36.166
Mom... I should get
some money back from him.

23:37.792 --> 23:38.627
What money?

23:38.835 --> 23:41.046
I lent him some for his hospital bills.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.339
You don't have any extra money!

23:42.339 --> 23:43.548
That's not big sum though.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.092
- But I can't hire someone I don't know.
- Mom, please.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.763
- You're a pain in my ass.
- Please, just once!

23:55.435 --> 23:56.269
All right...

23:56.978 --> 23:58.897
my mother-in-law is not well

23:58.897 --> 24:00.815
and she should focus on
her prep studies...

24:01.358 --> 24:04.319
- so you can work here.
- Thank you, ma'am.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.822
But you should change
the way you talk first.

24:08.073 --> 24:10.867
- What's wrong with it?
- It is way too scary.

24:11.242 --> 24:12.744
And make a brighter face.

24:12.994 --> 24:15.830
- You can scare off the customers.
- Understood.

24:18.750 --> 24:19.751
Thanks, mom.

24:24.255 --> 24:27.008
- You're so handsome.
- Grandma!

24:32.597 --> 24:35.100
Damn... I'm starving.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.935
Only water...
Damn it.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.025
Good, cookies!

25:05.588 --> 25:07.632
It was good. I'm so full.

25:10.135 --> 25:12.095
Some wine now?

25:15.807 --> 25:17.434
What's the most expensive one?

25:20.645 --> 25:22.105
This one looks fine.

25:30.739 --> 25:31.656
What?

25:47.338 --> 25:48.757
<i>What's all this?</i>

25:52.761 --> 25:54.095
<i>Is he a cop?</i>

26:08.985 --> 26:10.904
That's the girl from CCTV.

26:15.158 --> 26:17.744
Song Eun-ju,
28 years old.

26:18.328 --> 26:20.955
Whistle blower of
Platinum Peak Funds case...

26:28.797 --> 26:31.633
Whereabouts unknown
since tipping the prosecution...

26:31.966 --> 26:35.553
Song disappears with USB drive,
conclusive evidence of the case.

26:37.013 --> 26:40.058
<i>C.Q., C.Q. Vehicle 15 patrolling
around the lost house.</i>

26:40.058 --> 26:43.394
<i>Nothing significant to report.
Will move to Tancheon area.</i>

26:44.646 --> 26:47.065
He really is a cop.

26:49.234 --> 26:51.736
She's under protection program
after tipping off the prosecution.

26:57.534 --> 27:02.288
She's in a big trouble as
he lost all his memories.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.711
But how could I protect someone
that I cannot locate?

27:11.506 --> 27:15.510
He's the delivery man!
That means she lives here?

27:30.984 --> 27:33.027
How about change cable company?

27:33.027 --> 27:33.945
<i>Get lost.</i>

27:35.446 --> 27:36.489
Hello.

27:49.836 --> 27:54.007
Where the hell is she?
I think I checked all.

27:54.966 --> 27:55.758
I quit, I quit!

27:55.758 --> 27:56.551
Damn.

27:59.387 --> 28:00.388
What is it?

28:02.515 --> 28:07.061
Noise issue is all the same.
Even in this fancy condo.

28:09.397 --> 28:10.899
Where is she?

28:13.610 --> 28:15.028
What's going on?

28:15.486 --> 28:17.155
Someone's having a party.

28:17.447 --> 28:19.199
What the hell...

28:25.121 --> 28:26.331
Is she up there?

28:42.180 --> 28:43.473
What is it?

28:46.976 --> 28:48.978
I'm living downstairs...

28:49.145 --> 28:50.563
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

28:52.523 --> 28:57.070
I came because of
the noise of your footsteps...

28:58.613 --> 29:00.490
Ah, I'm so sorry.
I'll be more careful.

29:00.782 --> 29:03.910
No, it's not like I'm complaining...

29:03.910 --> 29:07.413
Since we're neighbors... I came
to say hello face to face...

29:07.830 --> 29:12.460
As we can bump into outside,
we can say hello as neighbors...

29:12.835 --> 29:14.212
Then we can meet again...

29:14.212 --> 29:17.257
to chitchat as neighbors...
Have a good time!

29:23.638 --> 29:27.767
Jae-sung, slice two rows of roll.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.549
It's too pretty!

30:27.368 --> 30:30.538
Hey girls, this is our best-seller.

30:30.621 --> 30:32.749
Knife-shredded ice flakes.
Only at our store!

30:40.548 --> 30:44.010
Jae-sung, mom's fallen for you!

30:44.761 --> 30:47.638
She didn't even listen to me
when I told her to hire you at first...

30:50.099 --> 30:51.392
What are you making?

30:52.143 --> 30:54.771
I hit so many ideas
when I'm dealing with a knife.

30:56.564 --> 30:58.316
I can move it like my own hands...

30:59.692 --> 31:01.694
I think I had some craftsmanship.

31:10.328 --> 31:13.331
Such a cute smile for that knife.

31:16.793 --> 31:18.252
I better get going.

31:18.961 --> 31:21.214
Your payday is 25th every month.

31:21.214 --> 31:22.090
I see.

31:23.257 --> 31:24.384
So next Monday?

31:24.384 --> 31:26.344
That is last month's page.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.054
It should be Thursday.

31:34.769 --> 31:36.187
Good night, then.

31:36.312 --> 31:37.814
Good night.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.111
- Don't come out for me.
- Yes, take care.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.295
<i>7AM, SHINWON STATION</i>

32:16.978 --> 32:17.854
Mr. Kim Young-eun!

32:18.729 --> 32:19.605
Mr. Park Kyu-nam!

32:19.981 --> 32:22.024

Mr. Yoon Jae-sung!

32:22.024 --> 32:23.484
- Here!
- Hurry up!

32:24.152 --> 32:25.445
- Name?
- Park Kyu-nam.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.947
- I came early in the morning.
- Get in the car, quickly!

32:29.198 --> 32:30.741
Where are we going?

32:31.617 --> 32:32.994
- Come on!
- Yes.

32:32.994 --> 32:33.786
Hurry!

32:42.879 --> 32:44.797
Are we going to Yangsoo-ri, right?

32:45.089 --> 32:47.341
Don't go to Paju like the other time.

32:47.508 --> 32:51.220
- Why are we going to Yangsoo-ri?
- To work, of course.

32:51.345 --> 32:52.472
What work?

32:52.722 --> 32:54.182
Usual stuff.

32:54.724 --> 32:56.142
One!

32:59.604 --> 33:00.480
Damn it!

33:03.566 --> 33:04.400
I'm sorry.

33:04.442 --> 33:06.527
You really should not hit
the unpadded spot.

33:06.527 --> 33:07.361
I'm sorry. I am.

33:07.361 --> 33:10.531
Cut! How come an actor
can't stand that?

33:10.531 --> 33:13.075
- But he hit...
- You should stand that anyway.

33:13.784 --> 33:16.078
Hey, replace him!

33:18.998 --> 33:21.125
Wait a second!
Nope, wait!

33:22.084 --> 33:26.964
Cut, how come you do it for real?
You should fake it.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.549
An actor should tolerate it.

33:28.674 --> 33:29.509
What?

33:30.551 --> 33:32.178
Do you keep talking back to me?

33:32.220 --> 33:33.804
You said earlier to stand it.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.057
Replace him!

33:40.978 --> 33:42.813
Ready, action!

33:51.781 --> 33:54.075
Cut! What is it?

33:55.243 --> 33:56.869
Get him out!

34:05.378 --> 34:06.712
What the hell is he?

34:10.967 --> 34:14.512
Sorry for the earlier stuff.
I was so into the role.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.809
I've never seen anyone

34:21.060 --> 34:24.188
fired as much as you
in my dozen-year career.

34:25.273 --> 34:26.857
You must be really experienced.

34:26.857 --> 34:27.858
A little...

34:29.985 --> 34:31.654
It's quite tough, isn't it?

34:33.739 --> 34:37.994
I'll be the guiding light
for your acting career.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.080
You're lucky to meet me.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.083
So right now,
we're in a drinking scene.

34:44.333 --> 34:47.962
Think you drink with a buddy
on Thanksgiving.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.380
Relax and act naturally.

34:50.590 --> 34:51.257
Cheers.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.342
- Can we do that?
- Of course.

34:56.679 --> 34:57.680
Just relax.

35:01.559 --> 35:02.685
What's that imbecile!

35:03.811 --> 35:05.479
We're not shooting yet!

35:05.646 --> 35:07.148
Get rid of him!

35:07.898 --> 35:09.066
Quick!

35:10.109 --> 35:11.569
Please get out of here.

35:12.028 --> 35:13.446
Hurry!

35:13.529 --> 35:15.781
He drank too.
Why only me?

35:15.823 --> 35:16.782
I didn't, in fact.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.951
He said he didn't.
Come out, quick!

35:20.411 --> 35:21.787
Come on!

35:32.423 --> 35:35.509
Mom, I'm going abroad
in a few days.

35:36.344 --> 35:37.511

35:38.262 --> 35:41.474
Take care and stay healthy.
Will you?

35:42.600 --> 35:44.518
You too take care.

36:14.882 --> 36:17.968
What a nice surprise!
You came to see someone?

36:17.968 --> 36:20.054
My friend is also at this hospital.

36:21.639 --> 36:22.973
Is anything wrong?

36:23.724 --> 36:25.351
I'm really busy now!

36:35.361 --> 36:36.112
Damn it!

36:56.966 --> 36:59.135
It's alright.
He can't see us from outside.

37:01.554 --> 37:02.888
Damn it, where's she?

37:06.892 --> 37:08.018
Who is he?

37:09.145 --> 37:11.230
A stalker?
Damn moron!

37:13.858 --> 37:16.360
What is your name, by the way?

37:16.694 --> 37:17.319
What?

37:48.225 --> 37:49.935
- Yes.
- I'm of 1982.

37:52.813 --> 37:55.149
- Born in 1984, really?
- Yes.

37:59.570 --> 38:00.946

Who's that? Your son?

38:56.001 --> 38:58.295
He's an actor, you said?
Quite good looking indeed.

38:59.171 --> 39:01.590
Cut the crap.

39:02.216 --> 39:05.719
He only plays petty roles.
You cannot call him an actor yet!

39:06.095 --> 39:07.471
You can hardly recognize him.

39:07.471 --> 39:12.309
No one can be a superstar overnight!
All start from petty roles I think.

39:12.434 --> 39:16.605
He shouldn't come back
until he makes it big

39:16.605 --> 39:20.025
as he declared to be a star
when he left home.

39:20.234 --> 39:22.736
Why is he coming back here so often?

39:22.778 --> 39:24.738
Easier said than done.

39:24.989 --> 39:27.241
He's been here the other time, too.

39:27.700 --> 39:30.828
Saying that he just came
to say hello, out of blue.

39:30.995 --> 39:33.414
As if he's going to die soon!

39:33.998 --> 39:36.500
And he gets lazy so easily
if I am not strict with him.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.377
<i>START 100-DAY PRAYER FOR JAE-SUNG</i> And he gets
lazy so easily if I am not strict with him.

39:38.377 --> 39:41.630
He can surely make a good actor
with this face.

39:42.381 --> 39:46.260
Be nice to him as he must come
for a shoulder to rely on for a while.

39:46.260 --> 39:48.846
- Why do you care!
- Why do you get angry at me?

39:51.181 --> 39:54.977
No, I was talking to myself.
Why did you bring him up anyway?

40:01.191 --> 40:02.484
The client's gone.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.242
I'll make it to a star for sure, dad.

40:12.161 --> 40:13.746
- Anyone you know?
- Not at all!

40:14.121 --> 40:16.457
He must find this place too dull.

40:16.582 --> 40:20.210
Young people should go to
so-called hair salons, not here.

40:20.544 --> 40:22.421
But he is really good looking.

40:24.715 --> 40:26.717
Can you tell that
from this small picture?

40:27.092 --> 40:29.219

40:34.308 --> 40:38.020
Jae-sung, where have you been?
We were worried.

40:38.020 --> 40:42.149
I'm sorry.
I had to go somewhere.

40:42.483 --> 40:45.194

- They did!

40:54.703 --> 40:56.705

41:00.876 --> 41:05.005
You did? What did you do?

41:06.256 --> 41:07.508
I was an actor.

41:08.717 --> 41:13.305
And I definitely will become
a famous actor.

41:13.472 --> 41:14.556

41:20.020 --> 41:22.106
He's getting worse, I believe.

41:32.658 --> 41:34.994
Why is she packing?
Is she leaving?

41:35.536 --> 41:37.955
What? She's really leaving.

41:38.539 --> 41:40.332
It's too dangerous
to go outside.

41:57.349 --> 41:58.767
What is she doing?

41:59.101 --> 42:00.686
Waiting for someone?

42:12.698 --> 42:14.908
Is it next Thursday?

42:19.163 --> 42:21.665
<i>ACTING TRAINING PLAN</i>

42:31.258 --> 42:33.052
Can I take the soy sauce?

42:34.595 --> 42:36.180
Wow, hello!

42:36.889 --> 42:38.515
What a pleasant coincidence.

42:38.515 --> 42:41.518
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers...

42:41.518 --> 42:43.854
Can you can a can as a canner...

42:47.316 --> 42:48.442
How are you?

42:51.070 --> 42:53.072
It was you who asked the question!

42:53.238 --> 42:55.074
It was you!
It was you!

42:55.365 --> 42:56.200
Cut it out!

42:56.700 --> 42:59.745
Did you rent out the whole building?
Don't make so much noise!

42:59.953 --> 43:00.829
I am sorry.

43:06.585 --> 43:08.295
- Hello.
- Yes.

43:13.550 --> 43:15.344
<i>WHAT IS METHOD ACTING?</i>

43:19.431 --> 43:21.558
I am sorry for the other time.

43:22.893 --> 43:24.269
No, it's alright.

43:25.062 --> 43:26.939
I thought of something for you.

43:26.939 --> 43:28.774
A customized acting method.

43:29.900 --> 43:31.735
Are you trying to fool me
like the other time?

43:31.735 --> 43:33.570
No, I gave it lots of thoughts.

43:33.654 --> 43:34.947
Want to give it a try?

43:36.323 --> 43:40.077
Relax and you root...

43:41.036 --> 43:43.664
And you're swayed by wind.

43:45.124 --> 43:46.792
You find inner peace.

43:47.584 --> 43:48.836
Make the sound!

43:50.003 --> 43:51.421
Shake harder!

43:53.173 --> 43:55.843
Attention everyone!
We need a volunteer!

43:56.385 --> 43:58.554
The action is a bit tough...

43:58.679 --> 44:01.890
but anyone wants to do it?
It can be a good experience.

44:05.060 --> 44:06.228
It's a good chance.

44:06.228 --> 44:07.771
You can improve only by doing it.

44:07.896 --> 44:08.981
It won't hurt you... that much.

44:09.773 --> 44:11.275
Good. Your look fits the role.

44:11.358 --> 44:13.193
Have you had any physical training?

44:13.569 --> 44:14.987
I don't know.

44:14.987 --> 44:17.573
But I assume I do to some extent.

44:17.573 --> 44:18.657
Some extent...

44:19.032 --> 44:19.700
alright.

44:19.741 --> 44:22.202
It's a complicated scene
so just fall on the ground

44:22.202 --> 44:24.246
when you're hit by the lead man.
got it everyone?

44:24.663 --> 44:27.291
And you, just stand by him
like his bodyguard.

44:28.041 --> 44:29.376
Bodyguard...

44:29.376 --> 44:30.878
Action is important but

44:30.878 --> 44:32.713
try to express your feelings
for the heroine...

44:32.713 --> 44:34.006
Am I talking to myself now?

44:34.006 --> 44:34.756
Okay, let's roll!

44:34.756 --> 44:36.592
Give me some space to focus!

44:36.842 --> 44:38.385
I will do my best.

44:40.137 --> 44:41.263
Sure.

44:42.472 --> 44:44.933
Don't expect anything from me.

44:46.727 --> 44:47.186
Ready!

44:49.438 --> 44:50.439
Action!

44:52.065 --> 44:53.609
Stay in the car, listen to me!

44:53.817 --> 44:56.570
- Damn bastards!
- It's alright.

44:57.738 --> 45:00.616
Don't be afraid, I'm scared, too.

45:01.158 --> 45:03.285
No, I don't want to see you get hurt!

45:06.788 --> 45:08.582
- Get in the car, now!
- Honey!

45:08.582 --> 45:09.499
Get in, I said!

45:16.715 --> 45:18.926
Stay away from me!

45:25.974 --> 45:27.059
What the hell?

45:29.978 --> 45:31.355
What are you doing?

45:34.983 --> 45:35.901
Get lost!

45:42.324 --> 45:43.533
Stop it! Cut!

45:44.284 --> 45:47.663
Why didn't you cut it?
This certainly seems so wrong!

45:48.121 --> 45:52.209
Who do you think you are?
Bruce Lee?

45:54.002 --> 45:55.921
I don't get it at all!

46:03.262 --> 46:05.222
Okay!

46:05.222 --> 46:08.141
Do you know anything about
method acting?

46:08.350 --> 46:12.229
How was it? Wasn't I awesome?
I was so into the character.

46:13.063 --> 46:14.147
Understood.

46:15.482 --> 46:16.858
What a loser...

46:19.653 --> 46:22.823
You've done some martial arts, I guess?

46:23.407 --> 46:24.032
I am sorry.

46:24.032 --> 46:26.576
Don't be. You were so charismatic.

46:26.785 --> 46:28.745
The director liked your action a lot.

46:28.996 --> 46:31.331
He thinks you would be perfect
for the boss' right-hand man.

46:31.540 --> 46:32.457
Can you do that?

46:33.834 --> 46:35.335
- Right-hand man?
- Yes.

46:35.335 --> 46:37.462
- I served at the Marines.
- Good for you.

46:37.838 --> 46:39.631
Let me have your name and number.

46:45.137 --> 46:46.847
So strange.

46:47.597 --> 46:49.891
Why come here every Thursday?

47:08.327 --> 47:09.202
Eun-ju!

47:09.828 --> 47:11.830
Let me carry it for you.
It's too heavy.

47:11.872 --> 47:13.290
It's okay, I can do it.

47:13.290 --> 47:15.792
No, neighbors should help each other.

47:16.043 --> 47:18.045
I'm fine. I really can do it.

47:18.045 --> 47:20.130
I'm fine too, it really looks heavy.

47:20.297 --> 47:22.966
- At least to your door...
- Please, it is alright. I mean it!

47:29.765 --> 47:32.100
Are you okay?
I was just trying to help...

47:32.142 --> 47:34.019
Why is it closing? I am sorry!

47:37.481 --> 47:40.233
Damn stupid!
You pressed the close button!

47:41.151 --> 47:43.487
We're shooting.
Get ready everyone!

47:43.987 --> 47:44.654
Jae-sung.

47:45.280 --> 47:46.114
Yes, sir.

47:46.698 --> 47:47.491
It was really good.

47:47.491 --> 47:52.621
You say the lines more powerful and
charismatic this time. Look.

47:53.372 --> 47:55.916
You will get to see the blood

47:56.124 --> 47:57.376
if you attempt our territory!

47:57.376 --> 48:00.170
That face is really good!
With some more charisma!

48:00.670 --> 48:03.507
Can you do it?
Relax, you can do it.

48:03.882 --> 48:05.300
Everyone, get ready!

48:08.011 --> 48:09.429
What was the line again?

48:09.429 --> 48:12.766
You will get to see the blood
if you attempt our territory!

48:14.851 --> 48:15.644
Pardon?

48:16.395 --> 48:18.980
You... just look at it.

48:26.238 --> 48:28.281
Okay, I'm ready!

48:29.116 --> 48:31.034
- Hello!
- Hi.

48:34.955 --> 48:36.623
Scene Fifty-five.
Take one.

48:38.208 --> 48:40.377
Ready... action!

48:50.554 --> 48:51.888
You!!

48:55.934 --> 48:57.144
You!!

48:59.521 --> 49:00.981
Blood!!

49:00.981 --> 49:01.648
Cut!

49:01.648 --> 49:03.150
You drive me nuts.

49:03.275 --> 49:05.861
You have to say all the line.
Follow the script!

49:07.154 --> 49:08.572
Where did you study acting?

49:09.156 --> 49:14.411
It was awesome, keep it!
Great, next scene!

49:14.411 --> 49:16.913
What? What's great?
What does he keep?

49:16.913 --> 49:19.166
That scene's done.
They keep the first take.

49:19.583 --> 49:20.792
Excellent!

49:23.879 --> 49:25.172
Impact!

49:25.464 --> 49:27.716
- What?
- He has the impact you don't have.

49:27.716 --> 49:30.969
What? What's wrong with you?
Why is he doing that?

49:30.969 --> 49:32.012
Cause the take was good.

49:32.012 --> 49:34.514
What is this situation?
Hold! Everyone hold!

49:42.939 --> 49:44.858
There! Jae-sung! It's you!

49:44.983 --> 49:45.942
I see that.

49:48.737 --> 49:50.030
It feels so strange.

49:50.322 --> 49:51.573
Girls, it's really him.

49:51.573 --> 49:52.491
Cool!

49:55.285 --> 49:56.786
Can I take a picture?

49:58.205 --> 50:00.832
Sorry, no photos.

50:01.249 --> 50:03.543
- Then handshake...
- Sure, thanks.

50:03.877 --> 50:06.338
It's amazing, so cool!

50:06.338 --> 50:07.923
I really want to turn it off.

50:08.798 --> 50:11.092
You're gone so fast.
That's it?

50:11.218 --> 50:12.385
It's a small role.

50:13.595 --> 50:14.888
It's unfair!

50:19.809 --> 50:21.770
One noodle with fried tofu, please.

50:28.026 --> 50:29.444
Here's your noodle.

50:35.617 --> 50:36.576
Excuse me.

50:38.119 --> 50:40.997
Don't have to apology for the carrier.

50:41.957 --> 50:44.918
- No, it's not that...
- It really is okay. Don't bother.

50:45.168 --> 50:47.128
No, what I am trying to say is...

50:48.255 --> 50:50.006
that noodle is mine.

50:52.676 --> 50:57.180
Yours is with fried tofu,
but that's with fried shrimp, mine.

51:03.770 --> 51:05.605
Listen, Eun-ju.

51:07.399 --> 51:10.277
I can have a free sushi plate
with two more stamps.

51:13.488 --> 51:15.365
Would you like some sushi?

51:23.290 --> 51:25.208
<i>ONE STAMP IF YOU LIKE IT</i>

51:31.214 --> 51:33.717
<i>ONE STAMP WHEN YOU COMPLETE IT</i>

51:53.987 --> 51:55.864
Eun-ju, please sit here.

51:56.906 --> 51:58.033
Your coke.

52:01.995 --> 52:03.747
One moment.

52:04.998 --> 52:06.374
Look ahead, please.

53:02.430 --> 53:04.015
He looks much better on screen.

53:04.891 --> 53:06.601
Not handsome at all in real.

53:08.144 --> 53:10.814
Hair, make-up, wardrobe!
Where are you all?

53:11.606 --> 53:13.149
- Sorry, would you please?
- Pardon?

53:14.359 --> 53:15.318
Wait!

53:19.030 --> 53:21.282
Give me some massage, too.

53:23.910 --> 53:25.245
How could they
just leave him like this?

53:25.245 --> 53:27.247
- You're doing it?
- Yes.

53:28.748 --> 53:31.167
- He must be really an asshole.
- Right.

53:31.584 --> 53:32.627
I can tell.

53:32.627 --> 53:34.170
You're hurting me now!

53:34.170 --> 53:36.256
The worst kind I've ever seen.

53:36.798 --> 53:39.509
Gosh... I'm your agent
and now also make-up artist.

53:39.801 --> 53:41.678
Sorry you couldn't rest
on your off day.

53:41.678 --> 53:45.056
No problem. Be a famous actor soon
so that nobody can ignore you.

53:45.473 --> 53:46.891
Will do my best.

53:52.939 --> 53:54.315
Hello, writer Park.

53:55.275 --> 53:56.860
What are you talking about?

53:58.486 --> 54:00.029
I like the story now.

54:00.822 --> 54:02.824
Who called you?

54:06.453 --> 54:08.872
My dear. Come here.

54:09.164 --> 54:11.291
Give him the organic food.

54:11.541 --> 54:14.711
Let's see who my best friend is.

54:29.684 --> 54:32.771
You shouldn't do this, ma'am.

54:35.064 --> 54:36.566
<i>If boss sees this...</i>

54:39.068 --> 54:40.612
Don't call me that way.

54:41.905 --> 54:44.324
It's not I became his girl
because I wanted to.

54:44.699 --> 54:45.909
But ma'am...

54:46.326 --> 54:48.119
The best performance!

54:49.496 --> 54:51.164
Why are you two together?

54:51.748 --> 54:53.249
Why so close?

54:54.250 --> 54:57.545
You betrayed my trust?
Kill that son of a bitch!

55:01.633 --> 55:03.968
How come the story goes like that?

55:19.776 --> 55:22.278
<i>CLIENT SUNG EUN-JU</i>
What shall I do?

55:30.995 --> 55:31.371
Hello.

55:31.371 --> 55:33.081
<i>Huh? You take the call?</i>

55:33.498 --> 55:35.750
<i>You always told me
to leave the voice mail.</i>

55:38.545 --> 55:40.338
I just wanted to.

55:40.547 --> 55:41.714
<i>Anyway...</i>

55:42.340 --> 55:45.218
<i>I was wondering when my case
would be completed</i>

55:45.760 --> 55:46.761
Your case?

55:47.470 --> 55:50.932
<i>Yes, my case. This is Kim.</i>

55:52.308 --> 55:55.562
Sorry but I cannot recall it...

55:56.646 --> 55:58.731
My boss is pushing me hard.

55:59.107 --> 56:02.235
We can pay more if needed.

56:02.402 --> 56:03.736
<i>Let's meet.</i>

56:03.820 --> 56:06.865
<i>It's awkward to discuss this kind of thing
only over the phone...</i>

56:07.156 --> 56:10.034
<i>Yet, I have to discuss something more
about Song Eun-ju.</i>

56:33.099 --> 56:35.435
Sorry to make you come all the way.

56:35.894 --> 56:37.395
Whatever...

56:37.604 --> 56:39.606
Why is he wearing sunglasses
in the dark?

56:39.606 --> 56:40.648
Rumor says...

56:40.648 --> 56:42.942
he kills anyone who meets his eyes.

56:54.245 --> 56:56.456
<i>I must've seen these people...</i>

57:02.962 --> 57:07.008
We don't have surveillance camera
or recording equipments.

57:08.384 --> 57:09.302
Right.

57:09.886 --> 57:12.347
Before we pay you extra expenses...

57:13.514 --> 57:15.892
<i>Would you please let me know
when you would...</i>

57:17.060 --> 57:17.977
wrap up?

57:20.104 --> 57:23.983
Is there any particular style
you want it to be done?

57:23.983 --> 57:28.029
Nothing special...

57:28.404 --> 57:31.574
We just want you to finish up
and show us the result.

57:31.783 --> 57:35.244
You're in a hurry, so you tell me
the way you want it to be done.

57:35.370 --> 57:37.497
I think there's some misunderstanding.

57:37.789 --> 57:40.124
It's not like that.
We're just saying...

57:43.878 --> 57:45.505
As you know,
we made a deal...

57:46.255 --> 57:50.468
that you would get rid of
Song by 25th of last month.

57:51.135 --> 57:54.097
It's a bit overdue.

57:55.348 --> 57:58.101
And if she turns herself
to the prosecution,

57:58.559 --> 58:01.062
it makes things complicated.

58:02.939 --> 58:05.066
So we're just asking you to speed up.

58:31.092 --> 58:32.301
Will contact you.

58:45.189 --> 58:46.482
- Nam.
- Yes, sir.

58:47.066 --> 58:49.402
- Follow him.
- Yes, sir.

58:50.278 --> 58:51.946
Find out where she is.

59:03.082 --> 59:05.001
So he is a killer not a cop?

59:05.710 --> 59:07.462
Watching her to kill her?

59:08.171 --> 59:09.255
Bastard!

59:12.383 --> 59:15.720
It's the last day.
I'm so sorry.

59:16.596 --> 59:18.639
Wish we could do it until the end.

59:19.432 --> 59:20.725
Yes, but...

59:22.518 --> 59:23.853
I learned a lot.

59:23.853 --> 59:27.148
It was a meaningful experience
to work with you.

59:28.066 --> 59:31.569
You're so nice!
Unlike someone.

59:35.364 --> 59:37.325
Don't put on so much make-up!

59:37.325 --> 59:39.368
I'm not a meat!

59:41.579 --> 59:43.498
We'll start shortly.
Everyone get ready.

59:47.085 --> 59:48.044
Ready.

59:50.129 --> 59:50.797
Action!

01:00:00.556 --> 01:00:02.975
I trusted you like a real brother.

01:00:05.144 --> 01:00:06.729
But you tried to steal my girl?

01:00:12.068 --> 01:00:13.611
Didn't he hit for real?

01:00:13.986 --> 01:00:17.406
You damn son of a bitch!
You asshole!

01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:18.449
Give it to me!

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.201
What is wrong with him?
Min-seok!

01:00:21.452 --> 01:00:22.286
Cut!

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.590
Damn it!

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.176
Cut!

01:00:37.343 --> 01:00:38.344
Stop the rain!

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:41.097
Told you there's no
safety gear in the pit!

01:00:41.097 --> 01:00:42.056
What is wrong with you?

01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:44.767
I was too into the character...
Did you get that?

01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:49.605
What is it?

01:01:04.871 --> 01:01:06.122
Is it an OK take?

01:01:08.207 --> 01:01:10.459
Okay! Come up quick!

01:01:13.546 --> 01:01:15.673
I just love your professionalism!

01:01:16.215 --> 01:01:17.425
It will hurt a little.

01:01:20.511 --> 01:01:22.638
That really hurts.

01:01:22.763 --> 01:01:23.723
Don't exaggerate.

01:01:24.015 --> 01:01:26.767
He is acting so nice on TV.

01:01:26.976 --> 01:01:28.394
But I guess he is a real asshole.

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:31.230
I don't think he did it on purpose.

01:01:31.397 --> 01:01:33.482
You should act...

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.484
Instead really hitting someone!

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:38.237
But I heard these things happen

01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:41.324
when you're really into character.

01:01:42.241 --> 01:01:44.452
- So you're taking his side?
- Pardon?

01:01:44.619 --> 01:01:46.787
You don't care
how much I'm upset?

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:52.543
You're upset?

01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:55.379
I mean...

01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:59.342
I get upset to see people get hurt
because of my job.

01:01:59.342 --> 01:02:02.595
I know I know...
You don't have to explain.

01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:04.263
I know it's because of your job.

01:02:05.097 --> 01:02:06.057
Better get going.

01:02:06.182 --> 01:02:07.683
Already? Stay a bit longer.

01:02:07.683 --> 01:02:08.559
It's late now.

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:11.896
I got hurt on the back too...

01:02:12.897 --> 01:02:14.607
I hit the ground so hard.

01:02:14.941 --> 01:02:15.942
Where?

01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:18.194
Ouch!

01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:23.741
Wait a sec.

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:26.244
Hello.

01:02:27.954 --> 01:02:29.330
Isn't he dead...?

01:02:30.122 --> 01:02:31.666
- Let me go!
- Stop!

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:36.420
I'm back from the hell, ma'am.

01:02:41.384 --> 01:02:43.010
Holy shit!

01:02:44.804 --> 01:02:46.305
He's back again!

01:02:46.555 --> 01:02:47.974
So handsome.

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:49.642
Look at him!

01:02:49.892 --> 01:02:51.018
What's this?

01:02:52.478 --> 01:02:54.313
What happened?

01:02:54.939 --> 01:02:56.774
I just can't watch it.
I don't get it.

01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:58.526
Why is he alive?

01:02:59.652 --> 01:03:01.112
He's dead!

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.072
- You look more handsome in real.
- Yes, you are.

01:03:03.072 --> 01:03:04.448
Can we take a picture together?

01:03:08.035 --> 01:03:09.495
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:03:30.141 --> 01:03:32.018
You've been following me, right?

01:03:33.561 --> 01:03:34.437
No.

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:39.317
Give that to me.

01:03:41.277 --> 01:03:42.278
Give you what?

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:47.241
It's okay, give it to me.
You want my autograph, right?

01:03:51.954 --> 01:03:53.289
I'm a huge fan.

01:03:54.749 --> 01:03:56.125
Thank you.

01:03:58.252 --> 01:03:59.670
Here you go.

01:04:00.087 --> 01:04:01.422
- Thank you.
- No problem.

01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:06.177
You wanted to see me, director?

01:04:06.177 --> 01:04:07.386
- Sit down.
- I'm okay standing.

01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:08.429
- Please.
- I'm good, really.

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:11.265
The viewers' forum went mad
about your sudden death.

01:04:11.474 --> 01:04:14.310
So many postings urging the network
to have you back on the show!

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:17.146
- As you will play the boss from now on...
- Yes, sir.

01:04:17.146 --> 01:04:19.648
We need someone to play
your right-hand man.

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:21.275
Anyone in your mind?

01:04:22.735 --> 01:04:23.527
Action!

01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:27.823
You shouldn't do this.

01:04:28.991 --> 01:04:31.869
You should leave your love
for the sake of our gangs.

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:33.079
Cut!

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.623
You think you're playing Hamlet?

01:04:36.332 --> 01:04:37.708
Was it awkward?

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:40.711
I think you over-acted a bit.

01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:42.171
I was too nervous.

01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:46.634
Just relax.
You're a natural born actor.

01:04:47.676 --> 01:04:48.636
Way to go!

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:49.929
Thank you.

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:52.431
Don't mention it.

01:04:54.475 --> 01:04:56.477
Ready, action!

01:04:59.063 --> 01:05:01.190
You shouldn't do this.

01:05:02.149 --> 01:05:05.027
You should leave your love
for the sake of our gangs.

01:05:05.152 --> 01:05:07.321
That's quite good.
I'm sorry!

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:12.201
I'm using it for a good cause.

01:05:12.618 --> 01:05:13.786
It's alright.

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:32.930
This is the best property
for a short-term rent.

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:41.522
- Can we move in right away?
- Sure.

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:44.316
Everybody get ready!

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:46.277
Get ready!

01:05:47.153 --> 01:05:49.071
Ready, action!

01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:52.950
It was like a hell

01:05:54.285 --> 01:05:57.872
because I was alone without you!

01:05:58.414 --> 01:05:59.248
Cut!

01:05:59.498 --> 01:06:02.042
Where are you looking at?

01:06:02.251 --> 01:06:03.377
I'm sorry.

01:06:03.461 --> 01:06:05.671
- Look her in the eye!
- Relax. Think me as your real lover.

01:06:06.172 --> 01:06:07.423
- Okay, once again.
- Yes, sir!

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.632
Wait...

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:11.635
What is that?
Under his arm.

01:06:12.136 --> 01:06:13.762
- Oh, it's sweat...
- Is it?

01:06:14.096 --> 01:06:16.432
Let him wear the jacket!

01:06:18.851 --> 01:06:20.519
Don't think
you should wear it right away.

01:06:20.519 --> 01:06:21.896
Maybe after drying a bit?

01:06:22.104 --> 01:06:24.231
Everybody get ready!

01:06:25.107 --> 01:06:25.733
Action!

01:06:26.192 --> 01:06:29.195
It was like a hell because
I was alone without you!

01:06:29.778 --> 01:06:30.529
Cut! Cut!

01:06:31.447 --> 01:06:34.033
You're too aggressive.

01:06:34.283 --> 01:06:35.659
You love her.

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:38.245
But no affection is shown
on your face. Show some love!

01:06:38.704 --> 01:06:40.831
Ready, action!

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:45.336
It was like a hell
because I was not with you!

01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:51.050
Where are you talking to?

01:06:51.175 --> 01:06:51.717
Cut!

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.386
I'm really sorry.

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:56.722
He's talking to my boobs!

01:06:57.097 --> 01:06:57.681
Action!

01:06:59.058 --> 01:07:02.353
It was like a hell...
because I was alone without you.

01:07:04.355 --> 01:07:05.898
- Cut!
- It's cut.

01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:07.316
He scares me.

01:07:09.527 --> 01:07:10.986
I got too scared!

01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:13.822
This is a real hell...

01:07:13.948 --> 01:07:15.991
You don't feel any emotions?

01:07:16.742 --> 01:07:17.535
I'm sorry.

01:07:23.832 --> 01:07:26.669
I managed dialogues
for action scenes.

01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:28.546
But in love scenes,

01:07:29.463 --> 01:07:31.340
it's killing me.
I cannot do anything!

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.800
You said there's a kiss too.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.635
Yes, it bothers me most!

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:36.762
You must've kissed at least once.

01:07:36.804 --> 01:07:38.931
I must've. I'm 32 you know.

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:41.600
The problem is
I don't remember it.

01:07:43.352 --> 01:07:45.479
Your body does...
for that sort of things.

01:07:49.984 --> 01:07:50.776
Lina.

01:07:51.277 --> 01:07:51.944
Yes?

01:07:53.153 --> 01:07:56.740
I know it's not easy
but can I ask you a favor?

01:07:56.949 --> 01:07:57.992
What is it?

01:08:01.787 --> 01:08:03.872
Can we kiss for once?

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:05.958
What?

01:08:10.296 --> 01:08:11.839
No, never mind.

01:08:13.966 --> 01:08:15.426
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

01:08:15.426 --> 01:08:17.928
- You must think I'm crazy.
- No, not really...

01:08:19.805 --> 01:08:23.975
But you tell me to kiss
while eating an onion?

01:08:25.394 --> 01:08:28.439
Of course, I need to brush.

01:08:28.897 --> 01:08:31.317
- Before the kiss.
- Are you drunk?

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:35.821
A little bit.

01:08:37.406 --> 01:08:41.368
But that kind of urge
is more like an instinct.

01:08:42.286 --> 01:08:43.578
Think hard.

01:08:45.331 --> 01:08:47.916
- Oh, I remember.
- Do you?

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:50.752
Awhile ago...

01:08:56.925 --> 01:09:03.932
when I came to your house late
after my first shooting,

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:07.685
<i>you gave me a big smile
as soon as you saw me</i>

01:09:07.853 --> 01:09:10.648
<i>and said you were worried so much.
Remember that?</i>

01:09:12.524 --> 01:09:13.442
Oh...

01:09:14.652 --> 01:09:18.822
You were so beautiful at that time.

01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:28.874
Now, I'm blushing.

01:09:32.711 --> 01:09:36.256
You think you can do it well

01:09:37.883 --> 01:09:39.635
if we practice just once?

01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:55.359
- Look, Lina.
- Yes?

01:09:56.777 --> 01:10:03.242
The actress comes onto me.
Not the other way around.

01:10:03.701 --> 01:10:06.370
- You mean the girl does like this?
- Right.

01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:08.831
Please attack me.

01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:31.770
I think we should stop here...

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:35.482
My love might make you
hurt and struggle.

01:10:40.195 --> 01:10:41.280
You fool!

01:10:48.579 --> 01:10:49.246
Cut!

01:10:51.165 --> 01:10:52.708
Okay! Great!

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:55.627
That was exactly
I was talking about!

01:10:56.003 --> 01:10:56.712
Eyes filled with love!

01:10:56.712 --> 01:10:57.379
Thank you.

01:10:58.255 --> 01:10:59.131
Let's move on.

01:10:59.131 --> 01:11:00.507
Let's move to next location!

01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:39.713
Hyung-wook...

01:11:41.006 --> 01:11:42.424
how come you are here...?

01:11:42.633 --> 01:11:43.467
Eun-ju.

01:11:44.885 --> 01:11:47.221
He'll not come.
The one you've been waiting for.

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:50.140
I know you come here
every Thursday.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:52.893
I don't understand...

01:11:52.893 --> 01:11:55.813
Trust me.
He's not coming.

01:11:55.813 --> 01:11:59.316
Actually, if he comes,
you'll run into danger.

01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:01.860
Who are you?

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.364
How did you find about me?

01:12:05.697 --> 01:12:09.076
You've been nice to me on purpose?

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:12.788
Look, Eun-ju,
I am...

01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:17.251
...a cop.

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:19.378
I got order to watch over you.

01:12:21.421 --> 01:12:22.381
What?

01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:24.383
But I won't just watch you no more.

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:27.553
I can sacrifice everything
I have for you.

01:12:28.971 --> 01:12:29.888
So...

01:12:32.432 --> 01:12:34.142
please trust me.

01:12:35.352 --> 01:12:37.729
I'll protect you no matter what.

01:12:58.834 --> 01:13:01.545
Who hired that asshole?

01:13:03.297 --> 01:13:06.091
Why is he having a romance
with the bitch he's supposed to kill?

01:13:06.091 --> 01:13:07.217
I'm sorry, sir.

01:13:09.803 --> 01:13:10.888
Never mind.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:14.016
What matters now is
to get rid of that bitch.

01:13:14.266 --> 01:13:16.351
I'll forgive you this time.

01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:21.857
And you will have one last chance.

01:13:23.275 --> 01:13:26.987
Bring someone who can get rid of
those two for sure.

01:13:29.406 --> 01:13:30.198
If you...

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:33.493
make the mistake this time again,

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:37.372
I cannot guarantee your safety.

01:13:43.253 --> 01:13:44.296
You know who I am, right?

01:13:46.048 --> 01:13:48.884
I think Han is the right guy for this job.

01:13:48.926 --> 01:13:51.219
<i>Heard that he cuts people with an axe.</i>

01:13:52.304 --> 01:13:53.847
It's too much.

01:13:54.431 --> 01:13:56.058
Let's ask Dongsung-ro gangs.

01:13:56.058 --> 01:13:59.645
Their Seok is said to kill
people with chopsticks.

01:13:59.645 --> 01:14:02.606
I'm afraid hiring local killers is too risky.

01:14:02.898 --> 01:14:05.776
Let's hire Choi who's working
as a foreign mercenary.

01:14:06.151 --> 01:14:07.194
<i>This guy can...</i>

01:14:07.194 --> 01:14:10.697
<i>kill people without leaving any trace.</i>

01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:13.617
We're running out of time!
Let's go for the axe!

01:14:13.742 --> 01:14:15.160
No, I'm for the chopsticks!

01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:18.789
I'm telling you
locals are risky!

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:22.209
How about this?

01:14:23.418 --> 01:14:26.171
We just need someone
who can take care of this ASAP.

01:14:27.005 --> 01:14:28.215
Let's call everyone.

01:14:28.799 --> 01:14:31.843
And choose whoever comes first.

01:14:58.412 --> 01:14:59.621
Did you like it?

01:15:00.122 --> 01:15:01.331
What?

01:15:02.374 --> 01:15:03.625
The thing with me...

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:05.210
Oh, you mean the shooting yesterday?

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.006
Well... can I be honest?

01:15:09.464 --> 01:15:10.257
Sure.

01:15:12.217 --> 01:15:13.051
I liked it.

01:15:14.886 --> 01:15:15.637
Huh, really?

01:15:15.637 --> 01:15:18.140
Yes, you've seen it on TV?

01:15:18.974 --> 01:15:22.477
Of course, you were devouring her.

01:15:22.477 --> 01:15:24.146
She was really aggressive.

01:15:29.151 --> 01:15:30.986
I was kidding!

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:33.905
How could I feel anything
when so many people are watching?

01:15:36.116 --> 01:15:37.159
Are you jealous?

01:15:37.159 --> 01:15:40.370
No way!

01:15:40.662 --> 01:15:43.707
You seemed like it, though.
You're cute.

01:15:45.959 --> 01:15:49.921
Well... shall we go on a picnic?

01:15:50.964 --> 01:15:52.007
Picnic?

01:15:52.966 --> 01:15:54.843
It's so beautiful.

01:15:55.427 --> 01:15:57.137
I am happy watching
you being happy.

01:15:57.137 --> 01:15:58.513
Yes, I am happy too.

01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:01.224
He meant a family picnic...

01:16:02.934 --> 01:16:05.145
Isn't it too cold?

01:16:06.146 --> 01:16:07.230
Great.

01:16:10.692 --> 01:16:11.985
Do you like it?

01:16:23.914 --> 01:16:25.207
Look at this.

01:16:39.846 --> 01:16:41.056
Give me your hand.

01:16:41.431 --> 01:16:42.390
My hand?

01:16:42.808 --> 01:16:44.601
- You know what?
- Yes?

01:16:44.935 --> 01:16:46.853
You're a completely different person

01:16:47.187 --> 01:16:48.897
from the one I met first.

01:16:49.064 --> 01:16:50.524
You mean in a good way?

01:16:50.816 --> 01:16:52.025
Sure.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.669
I like it.

01:17:23.014 --> 01:17:24.975
<i>The rain makes me blue.</i>

01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:27.435
<i>Please play the song
that suits the mood.</i>

01:17:27.727 --> 01:17:31.731
<i>Don't get too blue.
Hope this music will lift you up.</i>

01:17:31.815 --> 01:17:33.942
<i>Here goes the song.</i>

01:17:34.276 --> 01:17:36.653
You must've been tired.
You were deep in sleep.

01:17:38.196 --> 01:17:40.365
- Gosh, it rains a lot.
- Yes.

01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:45.620
Everyone's asleep.

01:17:46.955 --> 01:17:48.540
They must be tired.

01:17:56.798 --> 01:18:00.510
<i>He came into my heart
like a storm.</i>

01:18:01.303 --> 01:18:04.931
<i>A rock-solid manly man,</i>

01:18:05.765 --> 01:18:09.477
<i>I love his honest smile.</i>

01:18:10.312 --> 01:18:13.690
<i>He came into my heart
like a storm.</i>

01:18:23.742 --> 01:18:26.953
<i>He smiles at me when he sees me.</i>

01:18:28.246 --> 01:18:32.000
<i>My heart beats hard
when I see him.</i>

01:18:32.834 --> 01:18:36.379
<i>But he doesn't know how I feel.</i>

01:18:37.214 --> 01:18:40.342
<i>Should I confess him my love?</i>

01:18:47.474 --> 01:18:48.225
I will do it!

01:18:48.225 --> 01:18:50.560
<i>Our hourly traffic report.</i>

01:18:50.602 --> 01:18:52.687
<i>Due to the sudden rain,</i>

01:18:52.896 --> 01:18:55.523
<i>all the roads are heavily jammed.</i>

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:57.734
<i>Especially West arterial highway...</i>

01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:42.320
<i>TARGET: ONE MALE AND ONE FEMALE
100K</i>

01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:29.743
<i>RECENT DESTINATION</i>

01:20:32.454 --> 01:20:34.289
Should eat black noodle
on the moving day.

01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:39.836
What is it?
Wait a sec.

01:20:40.754 --> 01:20:41.755
Yes, coming.

01:20:44.007 --> 01:20:44.799
Eun-ju!

01:20:49.971 --> 01:20:52.057
I told you not to come out!

01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:54.726
Eun-ju, you should run!
Hurry!

01:20:57.812 --> 01:20:59.939
You've been out of touch forever
and now you say it?

01:21:00.148 --> 01:21:02.025
You know how long I've waited?

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.235
I'm sorry I couldn't contact you earlier.

01:21:04.944 --> 01:21:06.363
At the public bath...

01:21:08.948 --> 01:21:10.075
There were some circumstances...

01:21:10.075 --> 01:21:12.786
Eun-ju, please, run!
He's a killer!

01:21:13.787 --> 01:21:14.788
A killer?

01:21:15.747 --> 01:21:17.165
What do you know?

01:21:17.165 --> 01:21:19.292
Things all went wrong because of you!

01:21:19.876 --> 01:21:21.002
Stop!

01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:23.129
Don't do it.

01:21:23.254 --> 01:21:25.757
Eun-ju, please run!
Hurry!

01:21:25.965 --> 01:21:28.551
People asked him to kill you!

01:21:29.469 --> 01:21:31.471
Let's move to plan B.

01:21:31.930 --> 01:21:35.141
You should go abroad.
I'll get your tickets and visa ready.

01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:36.393
No, I can't.

01:21:36.518 --> 01:21:37.894
Then you wanna die here?

01:21:38.395 --> 01:21:41.648
They started to hire other killers
knowing you are here.

01:21:44.484 --> 01:21:47.070
And worse thing is...
they include him

01:21:48.113 --> 01:21:49.697
as the target, too.

01:21:52.617 --> 01:21:54.077
How can they know about him?

01:21:55.286 --> 01:21:58.164
What were you thinking

01:21:59.082 --> 01:22:01.042
when you pretended to be me?

01:22:02.877 --> 01:22:06.756
I just wanted to
protect Eun-ju from you...

01:22:11.803 --> 01:22:12.846
So

01:22:14.305 --> 01:22:16.599
during all these days
living as me

01:22:17.851 --> 01:22:19.686
that's only thing
that you found out about me?

01:22:21.688 --> 01:22:22.355
A killer?

01:22:26.568 --> 01:22:31.698
<i>If someone calls for a contracted murder,
I meet the target and suggest a deal</i>

01:22:32.282 --> 01:22:35.076
<i>saying I could fake the death
and forge identity.</i>

01:22:35.076 --> 01:22:36.953
<i>Asking whether a target is
willing to live a new life.</i>

01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:43.084
<i>100% of them agree.
It's for both sides' sakes.</i>

01:22:43.751 --> 01:22:45.420
<i>The clients get what they want,</i>

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.256
<i>the targets get the new lives.</i>

01:22:49.674 --> 01:22:52.093
It was same for her?

01:22:53.178 --> 01:22:56.890
<i>500K for killing Song Eun-ju
and bringing back the flash drive.</i>

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.727
Remember two things to survive.

01:23:01.394 --> 01:23:06.107
First, you need to be completely
under my control.

01:23:07.775 --> 01:23:10.612
Meaning nobody should know
where you are.

01:23:11.529 --> 01:23:13.490
If anyone finds out,

01:23:14.199 --> 01:23:16.367
the client might hire another killer.

01:23:17.452 --> 01:23:21.456
Then how can I contact you?

01:23:21.831 --> 01:23:24.501
You won't need to contact me.

01:23:24.501 --> 01:23:27.086
I'll watch over you and
protect you all the time.

01:23:29.464 --> 01:23:30.715
And second?

01:23:30.924 --> 01:23:32.050
Second...

01:23:33.218 --> 01:23:35.512
you should perform
your death perfectly.

01:23:37.847 --> 01:23:42.101
<i>D-day is next Thursday.
I'll get the documents ready.</i>

01:23:42.101 --> 01:23:43.853
<i>Remember, it's Thursday.</i>

01:23:45.813 --> 01:23:49.692
<i>Until then you should practice
your perfect death.</i>

01:23:50.443 --> 01:23:53.196
<i>You can survive only when
you nail acting your death.</i>

01:23:53.571 --> 01:23:54.906
Don't forget.

01:23:56.324 --> 01:24:00.370
You don't really need to
go outside of this building.

01:24:00.995 --> 01:24:02.163
<i>It's only a week</i>

01:24:02.872 --> 01:24:05.333
<i>And this building has
every facility you need.</i>

01:24:06.292 --> 01:24:09.337
You need to leave this country.
That's the only option.

01:24:10.838 --> 01:24:11.673
No, I won't.

01:24:13.675 --> 01:24:14.342
Why not?

01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:16.302
I won't leave alone.

01:24:18.096 --> 01:24:21.516
If they want to get rid of him too,

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.435
please get both of us free.

01:24:26.604 --> 01:24:28.773
Eun-ju, I'm okay.

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:33.653
It's very kind of you, but...

01:24:36.114 --> 01:24:37.073
I'm nobody.

01:24:39.659 --> 01:24:42.745
An extra nobody cares for.

01:24:42.996 --> 01:24:47.083
Nobody would care
even if I suddenly disappear.

01:24:51.129 --> 01:24:55.466
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

01:24:56.301 --> 01:24:58.136
Guess my role ends here.

01:25:02.432 --> 01:25:06.978
The miserable life nobody cares?
Do you really think so?

01:25:08.438 --> 01:25:11.649
Will your barber dad
think that way too?

01:25:11.899 --> 01:25:13.818
How do you know my father?

01:25:13.985 --> 01:25:16.404
He watches every show
that you have the least role in

01:25:16.571 --> 01:25:19.824
and prays every day for you
to make it big as actor.

01:25:20.116 --> 01:25:23.911
And you think your life is nothing
and are willing to throw it away?

01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:39.469
While I lived in your small loft

01:25:42.096 --> 01:25:48.311
I became to have a dream
that I never had for all my life.

01:25:49.437 --> 01:25:53.608
I became to realize
how happy and thankful it is

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.820
to have someone supporting my dream.

01:26:01.032 --> 01:26:05.578
Yes, all thanks to you.

01:26:33.773 --> 01:26:35.817
Let's disappear, all three of us!

01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:45.952
<i>First message.</i>

01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:48.538
<i>9PM tomorrow.
1 million for 2.</i>

01:26:53.251 --> 01:26:55.044
<i>Now listen to me.</i>

01:26:56.671 --> 01:26:58.923
<i>You, me and Eun-ju...</i>

01:26:59.632 --> 01:27:02.260
<i>need to do the performance of our lives.</i>

01:27:02.885 --> 01:27:04.554
<i>We have only once chance</i>

01:27:05.138 --> 01:27:07.557
<i>to make these clients believe</i>

01:27:08.141 --> 01:27:10.518
<i>what they see is real.</i>

01:27:11.811 --> 01:27:13.104
<i>Don't you ever forget</i>

01:27:14.105 --> 01:27:18.568
<i>that if we can't deceive them,
we'll be eliminated without a trace</i>

01:27:19.026 --> 01:27:21.320
<i>from this world by another killer.</i>

01:27:31.914 --> 01:27:32.832
Jae-sung.

01:27:33.833 --> 01:27:36.294
How come you didn't come to work
without any notice?

01:27:38.045 --> 01:27:39.422
What are you doing?

01:27:42.675 --> 01:27:44.302
I'm quitting acting.

01:27:46.804 --> 01:27:48.556
Oh, are you?

01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:55.813
I've never seen you wearing that.

01:27:57.106 --> 01:27:58.357
You bought it?

01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:04.447
Lina.

01:28:04.781 --> 01:28:05.490
Yes?

01:28:09.494 --> 01:28:11.287
My memory returned.

01:28:12.705 --> 01:28:13.998
Oh, good!

01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:16.709
- When did it...
- But...

01:28:18.461 --> 01:28:20.755
I guess it is not 100% good thing.

01:28:21.047 --> 01:28:24.425
I'm not the one you know.

01:28:26.302 --> 01:28:28.513
And I don't think
I should be around...

01:28:29.514 --> 01:28:31.057
for your sake.

01:28:34.018 --> 01:28:38.147
I believe you'd understand.

01:28:39.607 --> 01:28:41.192
Well, I need to go somewhere...

01:28:41.192 --> 01:28:42.735
- I am sorry.
- Wait.

01:28:44.362 --> 01:28:48.825
Jae-sung, what are you talking about?
I just don't get it.

01:28:49.325 --> 01:28:50.535
You say you're leaving?

01:28:51.661 --> 01:28:54.539
Just like that?

01:28:55.289 --> 01:28:56.916
Then what about shooting?

01:28:57.041 --> 01:28:58.835
Can't do it. I have to
take care of an important thing.

01:28:58.835 --> 01:29:00.670
What is that?

01:29:01.504 --> 01:29:03.714
I didn't know
you're that irresponsible.

01:29:04.257 --> 01:29:09.679
I guess this is it for you and me...
I'm really sorry.

01:29:11.597 --> 01:29:12.390
Wait.

01:29:16.185 --> 01:29:19.188
I just don't know what to do.

01:29:20.815 --> 01:29:24.777
Don't know what kind of person
you used to be before I met you.

01:29:26.404 --> 01:29:32.451
But does your memory with me
and my family mean nothing to you?

01:29:38.082 --> 01:29:42.753
Do you just remember what you want
and forget whatever bothers you?

01:29:47.258 --> 01:29:48.301
Whatever...

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.680
I don't care.

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:56.309
Don't care whether you leave or not.

01:29:59.186 --> 01:30:00.855
But you really...

01:30:03.774 --> 01:30:05.151
disappoint me.

01:30:26.547 --> 01:30:28.591
<i>CALLER ID
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR</i>

01:30:58.496 --> 01:31:00.247
Where is he going?

01:31:28.442 --> 01:31:29.986
Where did he go?

01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:50.631
Gosh...

01:31:54.844 --> 01:31:57.096
Why am I so nervous?

01:31:57.138 --> 01:31:59.473
- He's coming, right?
- Yes.

01:32:13.487 --> 01:32:15.698
Don't care about killing itself.

01:32:15.698 --> 01:32:18.576
I'm just curious to see

01:32:18.784 --> 01:32:20.661
her face when she's dying.

01:32:23.831 --> 01:32:25.541
Attention, everyone.

01:32:26.292 --> 01:32:29.879
Here's the face of someone
stabbed by the one

01:32:30.671 --> 01:32:32.339
she trusts and loves most.

01:33:21.597 --> 01:33:25.684
I felt shitty being followed by you.
But didn't tell you anything.

01:33:29.021 --> 01:33:30.022
Just leave now.

01:33:43.244 --> 01:33:45.704
- Who is that?
- Another killer we hired.

01:33:50.126 --> 01:33:51.418
Who the hell are you?

01:33:56.006 --> 01:33:58.134
You saw it?
You think I did okay?

01:34:05.432 --> 01:34:06.100
Why?

01:34:13.315 --> 01:34:14.984
Don't show your teeth!
Focus!

01:36:19.108 --> 01:36:20.109
Jae-sung!

01:36:23.028 --> 01:36:24.488
What are you doing here?

01:36:31.036 --> 01:36:33.205
- Who the hell is she?
- What is it?

01:36:37.001 --> 01:36:38.210
Who is this bitch?

01:36:39.378 --> 01:36:40.796
Who let this in?

01:36:43.882 --> 01:36:45.759
You called me bitch?

01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:49.596
Did you say that?

01:36:50.514 --> 01:36:52.057
Hold on.

01:36:54.101 --> 01:36:55.561
Wait, Lina.

01:36:56.937 --> 01:36:57.604
The crazy bitch!

01:36:57.604 --> 01:36:58.397
What the hell?

01:36:58.397 --> 01:37:00.107
What are you trying to do now?

01:37:01.150 --> 01:37:03.402
You're ignoring me
after your memory returned?

01:37:03.777 --> 01:37:05.029
Or what is it? Tell me!

01:37:05.446 --> 01:37:07.781
Lina, I'm in the middle of
a very important thing.

01:37:08.032 --> 01:37:09.033
What important thing?

01:37:09.033 --> 01:37:12.661
That! I will explain later.

01:37:12.661 --> 01:37:14.872
And I'm sorry to call you bitch.

01:37:16.165 --> 01:37:18.083
- That crazy slut!
- What? Slut?

01:37:18.334 --> 01:37:21.086
Hey! I heard it!

01:37:21.086 --> 01:37:22.713
Are you gonna swear again?

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:25.716
There is this crazy bitch in every village...

01:37:26.008 --> 01:37:27.217
Hey, you asshole!

01:37:27.593 --> 01:37:29.136
Why do you keep calling me bitch?

01:37:30.763 --> 01:37:31.472
I'm... sorry.

01:37:31.472 --> 01:37:32.639
Don't push!

01:37:46.236 --> 01:37:48.072
- You pull out the knife and come in.
- What?

01:37:48.989 --> 01:37:50.657
- Can't hear you.
- I'm not talking to you.

01:37:50.824 --> 01:37:52.868
- Come in now!
- You talk to me looking in the eyes!

01:38:38.497 --> 01:38:39.623
Are they... dead?

01:38:47.047 --> 01:38:48.257
Go and check!

01:38:49.883 --> 01:38:51.051
You go!

01:39:08.777 --> 01:39:09.945
Jesus!

01:39:22.666 --> 01:39:25.002
Lina! Please...
It won't be long.

01:39:40.058 --> 01:39:44.104
Seems like everyone died!

01:39:52.321 --> 01:39:53.572
Give it to me!

01:39:55.699 --> 01:39:58.577
As both killers are dead...
we saved the money, too?

01:40:01.371 --> 01:40:03.123
And who was that bitch?

01:40:13.008 --> 01:40:14.384
What is happening now?

01:40:14.384 --> 01:40:16.053
You're hurt!
Let me see!

01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:17.930
You were stabbed!

01:40:19.848 --> 01:40:21.308
No, I wasn't.

01:40:21.517 --> 01:40:22.643
We just faked it.

01:40:22.643 --> 01:40:24.478
It was just put-up job.
He and I.

01:40:24.603 --> 01:40:29.858
I'm fine. Really.
I'll tell you everything later.

01:40:31.944 --> 01:40:32.986
What?

01:40:48.752 --> 01:40:49.836
You may come out.

01:40:56.343 --> 01:40:57.261
Eun-ju.

01:41:01.223 --> 01:41:02.266
Are you alright?

01:41:07.312 --> 01:41:08.063
It's all over now.

01:41:19.324 --> 01:41:20.200
Lina.

01:41:33.338 --> 01:41:34.756
Good job, both of you.

01:41:45.642 --> 01:41:48.145
Are you really okay?
Didn't you get hurt?

01:41:48.145 --> 01:41:51.273
I'm really fine.
How about you?

01:41:51.523 --> 01:41:53.567
You got hit quite a lot...

01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:57.904
Oh, I'm fine.

01:41:57.988 --> 01:41:59.531
I used to be a good fighter.

01:42:00.115 --> 01:42:02.951
So I got hit on purpose.
For this act.

01:42:27.225 --> 01:42:28.268
I'm sorry.

01:42:31.104 --> 01:42:33.774
But why did you follow me here?

01:42:36.068 --> 01:42:37.944
You ask me why?

01:42:38.153 --> 01:42:39.696
How can you say that?

01:42:40.197 --> 01:42:43.700
Of course because I was worried
you were leaving so suddenly!

01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:47.913
Were you worried?

01:42:50.999 --> 01:42:52.417
Don't laugh!

01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:56.004
I thought you were dead...

01:42:56.505 --> 01:42:59.132
- I'm sorry to shock you.
- I hate you.

01:43:03.303 --> 01:43:06.973
When you said you were leaving

01:43:07.933 --> 01:43:11.603
did you really mean it?
Leaving me forever?

01:43:15.190 --> 01:43:16.525
Well, the truth is...

01:43:17.025 --> 01:43:18.110
What is the truth?

01:43:19.194 --> 01:43:21.947
What the hell?

01:43:22.531 --> 01:43:24.199
Anything you didn't tell me yet?

01:43:25.784 --> 01:43:27.411
Just shoot it!

01:43:29.705 --> 01:43:31.331
71.

01:43:31.707 --> 01:43:33.041
What the hell is that?

01:43:34.793 --> 01:43:36.461
- The year I was born...
- What?

01:43:37.462 --> 01:43:38.672
I'm forty-five.

01:43:45.429 --> 01:43:48.473
No way! Look...

01:43:53.019 --> 01:43:54.896
When I got my memory back

01:43:55.605 --> 01:43:58.233
I realized how old I was.
I'm really sorry.

01:43:59.985 --> 01:44:01.945
You're forty-five... Gosh.

01:44:03.113 --> 01:44:05.866
My uncle is forty-five.

01:44:07.951 --> 01:44:10.829
One more thing is...

01:44:10.829 --> 01:44:12.789
I'm not Jae-sung.

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:16.042
My name is Choi Hyung-Wook.

01:44:16.042 --> 01:44:18.336
- What?
- Choi Hyung-wook is my name.

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:22.632
I'm speechless.
Is there anything else?

01:44:22.883 --> 01:44:25.427
No, I told you everything.

01:44:25.427 --> 01:44:26.762
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:44:26.762 --> 01:44:28.889
If you have a kid or something,
better tell me now.

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.393
No, never!

01:44:35.103 --> 01:44:37.481
I think I told you
too many things at once.

01:44:37.814 --> 01:44:40.066
Yes, I'm in a daze now.

01:44:41.610 --> 01:44:43.695
Where are you going?

01:44:44.738 --> 01:44:47.032
I need to go somewhere
really important.

01:44:47.365 --> 01:44:48.700
Really?

01:44:49.159 --> 01:44:52.078
You were right about me.
I'm a crazy bitch.

01:44:58.627 --> 01:44:59.669
Hurry!

01:45:03.507 --> 01:45:05.842
I'm sorry!

01:45:06.301 --> 01:45:06.968
Really sorry.

01:45:09.513 --> 01:45:11.640
- You've got an accident?
- No... I'm fine.

01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:12.849
Sorry I didn't know.

01:45:13.183 --> 01:45:16.394
You know we need to air.
Let's shoot only one sequence, OK?

01:45:16.978 --> 01:45:18.188
- Can you do that?
- Sure.

01:45:18.188 --> 01:45:19.523
We'll be shooting soon!

01:45:19.523 --> 01:45:20.899
Jae-sung, you stand here.

01:45:21.358 --> 01:45:22.901
- You two stand...
- I'm sorry.

01:45:23.568 --> 01:45:26.363
You stare at her with affections
and turn around to leave.

01:45:26.363 --> 01:45:27.572
Let's get ready!

01:45:29.241 --> 01:45:30.867
I'm sorry!

01:45:31.701 --> 01:45:32.452
Action!

01:45:44.172 --> 01:45:47.509
Leave! Now!

01:45:49.177 --> 01:45:53.932
I know I should leave now...

01:45:58.270 --> 01:45:59.688
but I cannot.

01:46:01.147 --> 01:46:02.357
Shall we cut here?

01:46:02.983 --> 01:46:06.069
No, I don't want to leave.

01:46:10.866 --> 01:46:13.285
I want to stand by your side

01:46:15.662 --> 01:46:18.123
erasing all my past and memories...

01:46:20.834 --> 01:46:26.965
I want to be with you
as the one you've known.

01:46:41.104 --> 01:46:43.148
Will you let me do that?

01:46:58.872 --> 01:46:59.956
Yes, I will.

01:47:23.396 --> 01:47:25.565
What's so funny?

01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:27.567
- Hyung-wook, you should see this.
- What?

01:47:27.984 --> 01:47:29.402
Granny drew you.

01:47:29.402 --> 01:47:30.320
Oh, really?

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:31.488
Let me see...

01:47:31.696 --> 01:47:34.324
how our granny drew me.

01:47:34.616 --> 01:47:36.284
Which one is me, granny?

01:47:36.618 --> 01:47:37.243
This one.

01:47:37.786 --> 01:47:39.746
Her drawing is much better than real.

01:47:39.746 --> 01:47:42.999
What are you talking about?
He's much more handsome

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.293
and looks much younger in real!

Yes, tell me.

01:48:09.442 --> 01:48:11.736
- What were you doing?
- I was trying to focus.

01:48:12.821 --> 01:48:16.658
You need to do the action scene
with a new comer today.

01:48:16.866 --> 01:48:19.119
- Are you okay with that?
- Oh, sure.

01:48:19.953 --> 01:48:21.246

- Yes!

So you decided to act seriously?

01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:42.017

I don't have to be serious after all.
