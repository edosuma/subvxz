00:06.103 --> 00:08.344
Previously
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

00:08.344 --> 00:12.379
I want to introduce you
to two more queens.

00:13.551 --> 00:15.448
Betty's back!

00:17.655 --> 00:21.344
We are throwing
two fashion balls, darling.

00:21.344 --> 00:23.482
Yes!

00:23.482 --> 00:25.206
June Jambalaya.

00:25.206 --> 00:27.379
I feel like there's
a lot of bulk going on here.

00:27.379 --> 00:30.068
Maddy Morphosis.

00:30.068 --> 00:33.241
It looked like you purchased it
at the resort gift shop.

00:33.241 --> 00:37.137
Willow Pill.
This here is stun-ning.

00:37.137 --> 00:38.482
Con-drag-ulations.

00:38.482 --> 00:41.137
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

00:41.137 --> 00:44.413
Maddy Morphosis,
shantay you stay.

00:44.413 --> 00:48.137
June Jambalaya, sashay away.

00:59.241 --> 01:02.137
Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy, honey.

01:02.137 --> 01:04.827
My sister June
has left the competition,

01:04.827 --> 01:06.931
and I'm happy I'm still here,

01:06.931 --> 01:11.482
but June leaving is, like,
making it all set in to me.

01:11.482 --> 01:13.965
Yeah, bitch, this shit
is getting real.

01:13.965 --> 01:18.379
"Thank you for finally giving me
my drag family. June."

01:18.379 --> 01:21.310
It's really not a good feeling,
like, sending somebody home.

01:21.310 --> 01:24.103
Girl, you lip synced,
she got sent home.

01:24.103 --> 01:25.758
It's the name
of the motherfucking game.

01:25.758 --> 01:27.655
You deserve
to be here, too, girl.

01:29.310 --> 01:32.827
I am happy that my girl Maddy
is here to slay another week,

01:32.827 --> 01:36.413
but Maddy needs to show a little
bit more of her personality

01:36.413 --> 01:38.793
or she's just gonna get buried
by the other girls.

01:38.793 --> 01:40.482
Where my bitch at?

01:40.482 --> 01:43.620
Willow, congrats, ho!

01:43.620 --> 01:46.689
-You won the ball, bitch.
-You won the ball!

01:46.689 --> 01:48.931
You did, girl, even with
the flip-flops you walked in.

01:48.931 --> 01:50.448
That's what gagged me
the most, girl.

01:50.448 --> 01:51.586
You won the ball
with the flip-flops.

01:51.586 --> 01:53.034
I was trying
to throw you off, bitch.

01:53.034 --> 01:54.172
I have a question.

01:54.172 --> 01:55.413
Is there anyone here

01:55.413 --> 01:57.275
that thinks that
they should have won?

01:57.275 --> 01:59.551
Me personally, like,
after the runway,

01:59.551 --> 02:02.655
or, like, after,
like, doing everything,

02:02.655 --> 02:04.517
I felt very confident.

02:04.517 --> 02:06.689
I mean, you guys knew
how I was all yesterday,

02:06.689 --> 02:07.724
working and stuff.

02:07.724 --> 02:09.034
Like, I was very happy.

02:09.034 --> 02:11.172
Pushed my comfort zone
with my red look.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.620
It was more, like,
presentation, like, gown.

02:13.620 --> 02:15.793
Like, I understand, like,

02:15.793 --> 02:19.620
some of the reasons
why I'm in, like, safe.

02:19.620 --> 02:21.931
I'm a person who talks a lot,

02:21.931 --> 02:24.344
but when I talk,
I have conversations.

02:24.344 --> 02:25.758
Miss Jasmine don't do that.

02:25.758 --> 02:27.172
I feel like I didn't do a gown.

02:27.172 --> 02:28.655
I tried to do something
a little bit different.

02:28.655 --> 02:30.620
But I can understand that
they didn't like the nude.

02:30.620 --> 02:34.068
And then I understand with this,
though, it wasn't fully wedding.

02:34.068 --> 02:36.034
Oh, my God.

02:36.034 --> 02:37.172
I don't wanna cry, but, like,

02:37.172 --> 02:38.482
I really wanted to win a ball,

02:38.482 --> 02:40.241
and, like, I don't know.

02:40.241 --> 02:41.931
I'm really mad at myself

02:41.931 --> 02:45.103
for, like, not doing everything
the way I wanted to.

02:45.103 --> 02:48.862
Drag Raceis a very
stressful situation.

02:48.862 --> 02:52.448
We all cry
at inopportune times.

02:52.448 --> 02:55.517
But to quote somebody very wise,

02:55.517 --> 02:57.275
"a lot of emotions for safe."

02:59.206 --> 03:00.586
Baby, but you're doing great.

03:00.586 --> 03:03.310
I feel very disappointed
as well.

03:03.310 --> 03:05.206
I thought I was in the top.

03:05.206 --> 03:06.655
But I'm safe, so I'm happy.

03:06.655 --> 03:08.172
I'm still in the competition.
I'll show you guys.

03:08.172 --> 03:09.448
Bitch, don't play with me.

03:09.448 --> 03:11.862
I'm definitely
not in a comfortable spot.

03:11.862 --> 03:13.206
There's no such thing
as a comfortable spot here.

03:13.206 --> 03:14.482
Things can flip on a dime.

03:14.482 --> 03:15.965
Ooh!

03:15.965 --> 03:17.862
There's a lot of people
who are hungry for that crown

03:17.862 --> 03:19.931
and that little scepter and all
that cute stuff at the end.

03:19.931 --> 03:22.827
I've been preparing so long
for this and, like--

03:22.827 --> 03:24.275
-We all have, girl.
-But for me,

03:24.275 --> 03:26.137
I have the same issue
since I walked in that door.

03:26.137 --> 03:28.137
Focus on what Kornbread
can bring to the table,

03:28.137 --> 03:29.827
and, honey, I am gonna
serve it up to y'all

03:29.827 --> 03:31.310
just like I always do.

03:33.344 --> 03:35.862
I hate being the crying one.

03:39.068 --> 03:40.793
The winner
ofRuPaul's Drag Race

03:40.793 --> 03:42.310
receives a one-year supply

03:42.310 --> 03:44.517
of Anastasia
Beverly Hills cosmetics,

03:44.517 --> 03:49.965
and a grand prize of $100,000,
powered by Cash App.

03:49.965 --> 03:52.689
With extra-special
guest judge Loni Love.

04:01.931 --> 04:03.137
-Here we go!
-Yes, bitch.

04:03.137 --> 04:04.482
Good morning!

04:04.482 --> 04:05.724
Another day!

04:05.724 --> 04:06.896
Walking in the werkroom

04:06.896 --> 04:09.413
after last week
not winning the ball

04:09.413 --> 04:11.689
that I wanted to win very much,

04:11.689 --> 04:14.931
I definitely am trying
to be in a better head space

04:14.931 --> 04:17.448
and not being overly confident.

04:17.448 --> 04:18.620
How's everybody feeling?

04:18.620 --> 04:20.413
I just woke up smiling.

04:20.413 --> 04:21.896
I just was, like...

04:23.000 --> 04:24.344
Do you feel richer?

04:24.344 --> 04:26.896
Oh, I am richer.
Oh, my gosh!

04:26.896 --> 04:29.137
-I forgot that!
-Girl, you forgot?

04:29.137 --> 04:31.344
Y'all two are the richest
bitches in between us now.

04:31.344 --> 04:33.275
Oh, and Kornbread, too.
Sorry. And Kornbread.

04:33.275 --> 04:35.310
Yeah, I was about to say
speak for yourself, bitch!

04:35.310 --> 04:36.758
Shut the fuck up.

04:36.758 --> 04:38.482
Now all of us other bitches
gotta win money, okay?

04:38.482 --> 04:40.068
How crazy would it be

04:40.068 --> 04:41.965
if they did two balls
because they did so many

04:41.965 --> 04:43.241
but they wanna do, like,

04:43.241 --> 04:44.689
a different material
or something later?

04:44.689 --> 04:47.068
How crazy would it be
if you learned how to be quiet?

04:49.689 --> 04:50.931
What's wrong with you?

04:50.931 --> 04:54.103
I can admit
I am very Chatty Cathy

04:54.103 --> 04:56.413
just because
I don't like dead air.

04:56.413 --> 04:59.655
I do, like, notice that,
like, I talk a lot.

04:59.655 --> 05:01.241
-And it's not, like--
-You do.

05:01.241 --> 05:03.275
You're doing it right now.

05:03.275 --> 05:05.000
I am.
No, like, it makes me realize

05:05.000 --> 05:08.172
that, like, sometimes I need to
just, like, let the room speak.

05:08.172 --> 05:09.482
Well, since you opened up
the door--excuse me--

05:09.482 --> 05:10.413
Yeah, go ahead.

05:10.413 --> 05:11.620
This is the thing.

05:11.620 --> 05:12.862
I'm a human being
that talks a lot.

05:12.862 --> 05:14.551
Everybody in here
knows that I talk a lot.

05:14.551 --> 05:15.965
It is the simple fact
that there's a difference

05:15.965 --> 05:18.793
between talking
and having a conversation.

05:18.793 --> 05:20.931
It's a lot of us in here,
absolutely.

05:20.931 --> 05:22.448
-No, I see.
-But you got to--like now.

05:22.448 --> 05:25.379
Ooh, it's getting
a little hot in here, girl.

05:25.379 --> 05:28.275
You can't say, "Hey, Jasmine,
how are you feeling today?"

05:28.275 --> 05:29.620
And as soon
as you're about to answer,

05:29.620 --> 05:31.172
"Because I'm feeling
this kind of way."

05:31.172 --> 05:33.689
It doesn't allow people to feel
open to express themselves.

05:33.689 --> 05:35.379
I was literally trying
to give you and DeJa

05:35.379 --> 05:38.206
y'all 10s for helping me
with my garment the other day.

05:38.206 --> 05:40.172
Did I make a lot
of this garment? Yes.

05:40.172 --> 05:42.482
Did I get help?
Abso-motherfucking-lutely.

05:42.482 --> 05:44.103
I am not that kind of girl
that's gonna sit here

05:44.103 --> 05:45.551
and just be like, yes,
Miss Thing, I made that.

05:45.551 --> 05:47.551
Because I would have
called you out if you did.

05:47.551 --> 05:48.931
Which is what I'm doing

05:48.931 --> 05:51.655
in the middle of the speech
right now, bitch.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.172
I couldn't even
get that out of the way

05:53.172 --> 05:56.000
because you wouldn't allow me
to tell you thank you.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
And I'm sorry if I did that.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.034
I knew, like, no matter what,

05:59.034 --> 06:00.448
you were going to thank me.

06:00.448 --> 06:02.000
Yeah, but you see
what you just did?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.655
In the middle of me
explaining how I felt about it

06:04.655 --> 06:06.241
and trying to express it to you,

06:06.241 --> 06:07.758
you chopped me off,
and then started--

06:07.758 --> 06:09.793
-Well, I just heard a pause.
-Like again.

06:11.103 --> 06:12.965
If you're talking,
you're not listening.

06:12.965 --> 06:14.172
Listen to the words I am saying,

06:14.172 --> 06:16.068
and then give
a conversation about it.

06:16.068 --> 06:17.482
That's all I'm saying.

06:17.482 --> 06:19.172
I'm glad that somebody
said something,

06:19.172 --> 06:22.827
because it definitely
needed to be said.

06:22.827 --> 06:26.275
I don't know,
but this table is heat.

06:26.275 --> 06:28.103
Just on pre-heat,
bitch, yeah, yeah.

06:28.103 --> 06:30.206
Girl, this is warming
the oven up, ho.

06:31.551 --> 06:32.793
Hello, hello, hello!

06:35.517 --> 06:37.689
You're all still here?

06:37.689 --> 06:39.655
Yes!

06:39.655 --> 06:42.000
You know, today there's
a mountain of enter-taint-ment

06:42.000 --> 06:43.103
to choose from.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.758
So to get people's attention,

06:45.758 --> 06:48.413
a queen needs to sell
what she's got

06:48.413 --> 06:51.034
without giving it all away.

06:51.034 --> 06:54.620
It's called
the art of the tease.

06:54.620 --> 06:56.724
For this week's maxi-challenge,

06:56.724 --> 06:58.344
in two competing teams,

06:58.344 --> 07:04.000
you'll produce tension-grabbing
super teases for Season 14.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.931
-Whoo!
-Wow!

07:05.931 --> 07:07.586
A super tease
is those things you see

07:07.586 --> 07:09.034
before the season comes out,

07:09.034 --> 07:12.103
where you're, like, uhh!
I've gotta watch that.

07:12.103 --> 07:14.965
You'll be shooting your scenes
all around the set

07:14.965 --> 07:17.275
with Michelle Visage
and Carson Kressley.

07:17.275 --> 07:19.000
Ooh!

07:19.000 --> 07:24.137
You need to make iconic moments
of drama, glamour, and shade.

07:24.137 --> 07:29.724
And on the runway, category
is Night of A Thousand JLos.

07:31.620 --> 07:35.206
Come on, let's get loud,
bitches.

07:35.206 --> 07:39.448
Now, last week, Willow Pill
won the maxi-challenge,

07:39.448 --> 07:43.620
and Maddy Morphosis won
the lip sync for your life.

07:43.620 --> 07:45.931
This week, you two
will be our captains.

07:45.931 --> 07:47.482
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

07:47.482 --> 07:49.448
And get to choose teams.

07:49.448 --> 07:51.068
Ooh.

07:51.068 --> 07:53.448
All right, now, Willow,
you choose first.

07:53.448 --> 07:55.034
I need some Kornbread.

07:55.034 --> 07:56.896
-Yes!
-Yeah!

07:56.896 --> 07:58.275
Maddy, your choice.

07:58.275 --> 07:59.275
DeJa.

07:59.275 --> 08:02.413
Oh, girl, it's Hammer time.

08:03.413 --> 08:05.103
-Willow.
-Lady Camden.

08:05.103 --> 08:06.758
Ooh!

08:06.758 --> 08:08.965
-Oh.
-Oh, shit.

08:08.965 --> 08:10.689
-Maddy.
-Daya.

08:10.689 --> 08:12.862
Yeah!

08:12.862 --> 08:14.896
All right. Ooh!

08:14.896 --> 08:18.137
Bosco. Come on over, baby.

08:18.137 --> 08:19.896
Angie.

08:19.896 --> 08:22.758
Little old me?

08:22.758 --> 08:24.206
Willow.

08:24.206 --> 08:26.862
Kerri Colby, come on over.

08:26.862 --> 08:29.068
-Yes, bitch!
-Kerri Colby.

08:29.068 --> 08:30.586
Um, Alyssa.

08:30.586 --> 08:32.586
-All right.
-Okay.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.137
Jorgeous.

08:37.137 --> 08:38.827
-Oh!
-Ooh!

08:38.827 --> 08:40.275
Bitches, let's get lit.

08:40.275 --> 08:44.655
So Orion and Jasmine are left.

08:44.655 --> 08:47.103
I think...Orion.

08:47.103 --> 08:48.517
-Okay.
-All right.

08:48.517 --> 08:49.931
-Okay.

08:51.586 --> 08:54.620
I...

08:54.620 --> 08:57.137
That means Jasmine Kennedie,

08:57.137 --> 09:00.862
you get to choose which team
you'd like to join.

09:00.862 --> 09:08.137
Well, I think I'm actually
gonna go with Willow's team.

09:11.206 --> 09:12.586
I haven't worked with
a lot of the girls yet,

09:12.586 --> 09:13.586
so I wanna work with them.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.206
Well, go on, then.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.655
I didn't think
she was gonna pick our team,

09:16.655 --> 09:18.862
because how is she
gonna work with Kornbread?

09:18.862 --> 09:21.344
Racers, start your engines,

09:21.344 --> 09:24.275
and may the best drag queen win.

09:26.379 --> 09:28.758
It's gonna be interesting
to see how this turns out.

09:31.413 --> 09:32.827
Coming up...

09:32.827 --> 09:36.172
I have so many ideas
to brought into this tease.

09:36.172 --> 09:37.793
Cha-cha-cha,
I'm here, bitches, come on.

09:37.793 --> 09:41.034
Try to do the split,
and, like...

09:43.689 --> 09:45.068
How about
we come back to that?

09:51.172 --> 09:53.413
Let's do this.

09:53.413 --> 09:54.827
Sprint, bitch!

09:54.827 --> 09:57.172
Today's maxi-challenge
is a big one.

09:57.172 --> 09:59.413
We have to come up with ideas,

09:59.413 --> 10:01.724
create, write, and star
in a teaser

10:01.724 --> 10:03.827
for RuPaul's Drag Race
Season 14.

10:03.827 --> 10:04.931
That is a lot to do, okay?

10:04.931 --> 10:07.448
That's a whole lot
of moments.

10:07.448 --> 10:11.103
Kornbread
is being very, like...

10:11.103 --> 10:12.724
whatever with me right now.

10:12.724 --> 10:14.206
She's in her feels.

10:14.206 --> 10:16.517
But I still choose
being on her team

10:16.517 --> 10:20.000
because I feel like I need
to prove to her and those girls

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
that I'm a team player
when it comes to teams,

10:22.000 --> 10:23.862
and I'm not going to try
to overrun people.

10:23.862 --> 10:25.517
I'm gonna write
all my questions down,

10:25.517 --> 10:27.068
and then when
everyone else is done,

10:27.068 --> 10:29.000
I'm gonna, like, show you guys
my questions and thoughts.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.827
Because also, I know
you guys didn't pick me,

10:30.827 --> 10:32.482
but I actually went to college

10:32.482 --> 10:34.931
for advertising
and marketing communications,

10:34.931 --> 10:36.241
so I'm very excited for this.

10:36.241 --> 10:38.137
So I'm gonna, like,
sit here, do that part,

10:38.137 --> 10:39.379
and then I'm gonna come in

10:39.379 --> 10:41.344
with, like, my two cents
at the end of it.

10:41.344 --> 10:43.620
Jasmine is sweet or whatever,

10:43.620 --> 10:46.000
but it's just something there
that just rubs me the wrong way.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.517
It's like somebody bringing
a tray of cookies to the thing,

10:48.517 --> 10:50.310
and it's all these chocolate
chips, snickerdoodles,

10:50.310 --> 10:51.551
and these sugar cookies,

10:51.551 --> 10:53.724
and then somebody hand you
oatmeal raisin.

10:53.724 --> 10:56.068
She very oatmeal raisin to me.

10:56.068 --> 10:58.965
Has everyone seen
Drop Dead Gorgeous?

10:58.965 --> 11:00.448
-Yes.
-I really wanna go,

11:00.448 --> 11:03.034
like, a very, like, heightened
versions of ourselves

11:03.034 --> 11:06.758
that are just
absolute trash TV.

11:06.758 --> 11:10.655
I do some sketch comedy
back home in Denver,

11:10.655 --> 11:12.517
and I think
this is gonna help me,

11:12.517 --> 11:17.000
because I know what's gonna be
funny in a short little video.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.655
I have no problem being
just absolutely ridiculous,

11:20.655 --> 11:23.344
but I would like to stay pretty,
if that's okay.

11:23.344 --> 11:25.068
I don't think you could not
be pretty, girl, like--

11:25.068 --> 11:26.241
I can be ugly as hell, bitch.

11:26.241 --> 11:28.655
Just go back to, like,
five years ago.

11:28.655 --> 11:31.482
I wanna be, like, baby slut,

11:31.482 --> 11:34.551
post-verbal, just ah, ah, ah.

11:36.413 --> 11:37.724
Little Jorgeous.

11:37.724 --> 11:39.551
Oh, let me get myself together.
Sorry, like--

11:41.310 --> 11:44.241
Thinking about it
is just, like...

11:44.241 --> 11:45.482
Don't think.
Don't stress out, girl.

11:45.482 --> 11:47.206
-I know.
-The gag is everybody in here

11:47.206 --> 11:49.172
is just playing a heightened
version of themselves.

11:49.172 --> 11:51.344
-Bitch, just be Jorgeous.
-I'm a little bit surprised

11:51.344 --> 11:55.517
that Jorgeous is not bringing it
as much as I thought she would.

11:55.517 --> 11:58.862
I can tell that she's lacking
a little bit of those guts

11:58.862 --> 12:02.586
to just scream to the heavens,
even if you look like a fool.

12:02.586 --> 12:04.000
I was going to do

12:04.000 --> 12:06.206
kind of like a very
Kardashian West character,

12:06.206 --> 12:08.241
super dramatic,
I wanna, like--

12:08.241 --> 12:10.758
Kerri, pause two seconds.

12:10.758 --> 12:11.965
Sis, if you're writing,

12:11.965 --> 12:13.137
that means you're not
paying attention

12:13.137 --> 12:14.344
to what the group
is talking about.

12:14.344 --> 12:15.241
So just hold your pen
for a second,

12:15.241 --> 12:16.206
and then jump in with us.

12:16.206 --> 12:17.655
You got 10 questions already?

12:17.655 --> 12:19.482
No, I'm writing
what everybody's saying.

12:19.482 --> 12:22.551
Yeah, no, just put
the pen down, baby, join in.

12:22.551 --> 12:24.655
You're good. Whew.

12:24.655 --> 12:27.482
I think Kornbread
comes into this moment

12:27.482 --> 12:30.655
just being pissed at literally
anything Jasmine is doing.

12:30.655 --> 12:32.172
She's like,
"Stop breathing over there.

12:32.172 --> 12:34.896
I see you blinking, and it's
taking up a lot of room."

12:34.896 --> 12:37.758
So we have to start with mirror,

12:37.758 --> 12:41.000
which the first mirror scene
I'm seeing is more drama.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.896
Do we kind of wanna play
on what we were saying

12:42.896 --> 12:45.206
with me talking too much
this morning,

12:45.206 --> 12:48.034
and have, like, me, Kornbread,
and maybe Kerri possibly

12:48.034 --> 12:49.379
going in
and telling me to, like,

12:49.379 --> 12:50.689
girl, you need to shut
the fuck up sometimes.

12:50.689 --> 12:51.896
I'm fine with that.

12:51.896 --> 12:52.724
How do you feel
about that, Kornbread?

12:55.310 --> 12:56.448
I don't mind on the mirror one.

12:56.448 --> 12:57.931
All right,
let's put you there.

12:57.931 --> 12:59.275
What if you're talking
a mile a minute--

12:59.275 --> 13:00.448
This is probably
what you can write down

13:00.448 --> 13:01.689
in your little notebook, girl,

13:01.689 --> 13:02.655
so we can all
be on the same page.

13:02.655 --> 13:03.793
Yes, I thinking to start off,

13:03.793 --> 13:04.896
like, if you sat there,
like, I'll ask--

13:04.896 --> 13:05.689
-I was about to--
-Oh, I'm sorry.

13:05.689 --> 13:06.827
Go ahead, go ahead.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.620
Mm.

13:09.620 --> 13:10.931
I'm a bit worried

13:10.931 --> 13:12.862
that we can't just focus
on what we're doing.

13:12.862 --> 13:14.724
I feel like
we have to keep on stopping

13:14.724 --> 13:16.931
to sort of delicately deal

13:16.931 --> 13:19.551
with the social dynamics
of the table.

13:19.551 --> 13:21.241
I'm gonna be the girl that
takes myself way too seriously.

13:21.241 --> 13:24.413
Also saying things that don't
need to be said at that time.

13:24.413 --> 13:26.344
Wait, are you in character
right now or are you explaining?

13:26.344 --> 13:29.862
Oh, God, where's this gonna go?

13:31.379 --> 13:34.896
So this is really about showing,
like, personality, bitch.

13:34.896 --> 13:36.068
Like, don't hold back.

13:36.068 --> 13:37.758
-We have to go to, like, 11.
-Yeah.

13:37.758 --> 13:39.724
I am not an actor.

13:39.724 --> 13:40.965
Well, hold on.

13:40.965 --> 13:42.448
I'm not gonna say
I'm not an actor,

13:42.448 --> 13:43.931
because I'm a firm believer

13:43.931 --> 13:45.862
in just because
you haven't done something

13:45.862 --> 13:47.655
does not mean
that you cannot do it.

13:47.655 --> 13:49.586
You just haven't done it yet.

13:49.586 --> 13:50.586
In this one, we can do,
like, a callback

13:50.586 --> 13:52.000
to, like, an iconic moment.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.034
Kind of like how, like,
I don't have a sugar daddy,

13:54.034 --> 13:55.275
I don't have a sugar daddy,

13:55.275 --> 13:56.448
but, like, I don't have
a something else.

13:56.448 --> 13:59.551
There's so many iconic moments,

13:59.551 --> 14:03.034
but we know we wanna use
one of the most iconic of all.

14:03.034 --> 14:06.965
When Shangela stands up
against Mimi Imfurst and goes...

14:06.965 --> 14:09.103
I don't have a sugar daddy.
If I wanted a sugar daddy,

14:09.103 --> 14:10.620
yes, I probably can go out
and get one,

14:10.620 --> 14:13.517
because I am what?
Sickening, bitch!

14:13.517 --> 14:15.034
Ooh, we could say
something like,

14:15.034 --> 14:16.793
I don't have a meaty tuck.
I've never had a meaty tuck.

14:16.793 --> 14:18.758
If I wanted a meaty tuck,
I could make it meaty.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.275
-Aah!
-Yeah.

14:20.275 --> 14:21.689
I love you!

14:21.689 --> 14:24.931
Maddy has some amazing ideas.

14:24.931 --> 14:26.827
There's some good stuff
in that brain.

14:26.827 --> 14:28.034
Can you do the worm?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.310
I can try to do the worm.

14:29.310 --> 14:31.517
-You do splits?
-I can't do splits.

14:31.517 --> 14:33.344
That's the thing.
Like, try to do a split,

14:33.344 --> 14:35.275
and like...

14:35.275 --> 14:36.827
I feel like the worm

14:36.827 --> 14:37.758
would be a little bit funnier
than a split, personally.

14:37.758 --> 14:38.758
-I agree.
-Yeah.

14:38.758 --> 14:40.172
-Like a what?
-A worm.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.068
Okay.

14:42.068 --> 14:45.413
I have so many ideas
to brought into this tease,

14:45.413 --> 14:49.034
but I don't get the approval
from the other girls.

14:49.034 --> 14:50.517
We need to create a big fight.

14:50.517 --> 14:53.000
Maybe you can talk about,
like, oh, she's a Latina.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.275
You know, she doesn't speak
English, blah, blah, blah.

14:55.275 --> 14:56.379
And I was,
what did you say, bitch?

14:56.379 --> 14:58.034
Blah, blah, blah,
like, you know?

14:58.034 --> 14:59.862
I think it should be
something a little more--

14:59.862 --> 15:01.206
It should be more cutthroat.

15:01.206 --> 15:04.379
I think the girls,
they might be thinking

15:04.379 --> 15:06.655
that I'm only a beauty queen,
blah, blah, blah.

15:06.655 --> 15:10.724
I'm here to prove them
that I can do more than that.

15:10.724 --> 15:13.344
I mention something like
for being so refined,

15:13.344 --> 15:14.655
look at her face.

15:14.655 --> 15:17.379
I can, like,
exaggerate my makeup

15:17.379 --> 15:19.310
and be, like, a clowny
Latina kind of thing,

15:19.310 --> 15:20.931
and you, like, criticize me.

15:20.931 --> 15:22.758
Like, she called her,
like, a pageant,

15:22.758 --> 15:25.172
but her makeup was like a clown,
you know what I mean?

15:29.172 --> 15:31.000
How about we come back to that?

15:32.137 --> 15:33.310
I think Alyssa knows

15:33.310 --> 15:35.103
that she is in a group

15:35.103 --> 15:37.586
with a lot of big personalities,

15:37.586 --> 15:39.965
and that she's going
to have to be a character

15:39.965 --> 15:41.827
that is going to stand out.

15:41.827 --> 15:43.655
We'll see.

15:43.655 --> 15:46.551
Cha-cha-cha,
I'm here, bitches, come on!

15:46.551 --> 15:47.482
Coming up...

15:47.482 --> 15:49.034
Action!

15:49.034 --> 15:51.103
This is not RuPaul's
Southern Hospitality Race!

15:51.103 --> 15:52.931
I'm straight, too!

15:52.931 --> 15:54.344
-Oh!
-What?

15:54.344 --> 15:56.275
Y'all the ones that
are talking the whole time.

15:57.448 --> 15:58.689
You're supposed
to continue to rant.

15:58.689 --> 15:59.758
Oh, sorry.

16:07.275 --> 16:10.034
Today's maxi-challenge
is a super tease

16:10.034 --> 16:13.310
for Season 14
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

16:13.310 --> 16:16.758
We are finally
in our half-baked drag,

16:16.758 --> 16:19.310
and we're ready to start
shooting our mirror scenes

16:19.310 --> 16:20.586
with Michelle and Carson.

16:20.586 --> 16:21.793
Hey, Team Willow.

16:21.793 --> 16:23.931
-Hi!
-Hey!

16:23.931 --> 16:26.103
Carson and I are here
to help you shoot

16:26.103 --> 16:28.241
your super teases!

16:28.241 --> 16:31.000
Yes, and we need lots of drama,
over-the-top moments.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.724
Be yourselves, only more so.

16:32.724 --> 16:34.793
Who's up first?

16:34.793 --> 16:37.172
All right, so we three
are in the same--

16:37.172 --> 16:38.586
we're having a catfight.

16:38.586 --> 16:41.793
Okay, so let's take a look,
and we'll go from there.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.551
-Okay.
-Yeah.

16:43.551 --> 16:46.344
I am definitely excited
to show the girls my abilities.

16:46.344 --> 16:49.068
I also am a little hesitant

16:49.068 --> 16:50.482
because of what
they said earlier.

16:50.482 --> 16:52.448
And action.

16:52.448 --> 16:54.241
Girls, I cannot wait to be
computer-matched after this.

16:54.241 --> 16:55.758
Girl, I wanna do a presentation,
I wanna do swimwear,

16:55.758 --> 16:57.000
I wanna do gowns,
I wanna do everything!

16:57.000 --> 16:59.896
Miss Thing, do you ever
shut the hell up?

16:59.896 --> 17:01.551
-What?
-Yeah, girl.

17:01.551 --> 17:04.000
You really been talking so much,
my ears are starting to bleed.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.517
Me? Y'all the ones that
are talking the whole time!

17:09.931 --> 17:11.034
You're supposed
to continue to rant.

17:11.034 --> 17:12.586
Oh, sorry.
I didn't know. Sorry.

17:12.586 --> 17:13.896
You're supposed to just keep
talking and talking and talking.

17:13.896 --> 17:15.310
So, wait.
So what happened?

17:15.310 --> 17:17.137
She's supposed to keep talking
and talking and talking

17:17.137 --> 17:18.965
till we get, like, mad
and be, like, shut up.

17:18.965 --> 17:20.310
This the first time
she been quiet.

17:20.310 --> 17:22.068
Just take a deep breath,
slow it down,

17:22.068 --> 17:24.482
and keep that chatter
going the entire time.

17:24.482 --> 17:26.206
Perfect. Awesome. Thank you.

17:26.206 --> 17:28.413
Take two. Action.

17:28.413 --> 17:30.931
Girl, do you ever shut up?

17:30.931 --> 17:32.689
Yeah, girl,
you been talking so much,

17:32.689 --> 17:34.275
you're making my ears bleed!

17:34.275 --> 17:36.379
Me? Y'all the ones talking
all the time, girl.

17:36.379 --> 17:38.482
Kiki, yah, yah, yah,
ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka.

17:38.482 --> 17:40.965
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

17:40.965 --> 17:43.103
Do y'all think I'll be
in the bottom this week?

17:44.310 --> 17:45.448
-Cut.
-That was great.

17:45.448 --> 17:46.724
Cute.

17:46.724 --> 17:48.137
Jasmine is actually
doing really good,

17:48.137 --> 17:49.758
because she's
just talking a lot.

17:49.758 --> 17:52.689
And I feel like we work
very well together,

17:52.689 --> 17:54.068
which was shocking.

17:55.620 --> 17:57.655
Hi, Team Maddy Morphosis.

17:57.655 --> 17:59.310
-Hey!
-Hi!

17:59.310 --> 18:02.172
Time for your Untuckedmoments
for your super tease.

18:02.172 --> 18:07.241
I'm a little nervous because
I've never been on a set before.

18:07.241 --> 18:09.482
Although it looks like
the werkroom.

18:09.482 --> 18:11.379
Teases need to be full of drama.

18:11.379 --> 18:14.103
Just, you know,
big energy that builds.

18:14.103 --> 18:15.896
So don't forget to bring it.

18:15.896 --> 18:17.448
First scene, who's up first?

18:17.448 --> 18:19.275
-Me and Angie.
-Okay.

18:19.275 --> 18:20.758
We're getting a catfight.
Is that what this is about?

18:20.758 --> 18:22.655
Yes, you're about
to get a real moment.

18:22.655 --> 18:24.620
Helen Lawson
in the ladies room.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.758
Oh, yeah. Whatever
that means, uh-huh.

18:28.241 --> 18:31.482
All right, here we go, kids.
And acción.

18:31.482 --> 18:35.862
So, guys, who in the group is
gonna be in the bottom tonight?

18:35.862 --> 18:38.413
I do not want anyone to go home.

18:38.413 --> 18:39.758
I just love y'all
so much, and--

18:39.758 --> 18:41.034
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:41.034 --> 18:43.034
You're trying
to do all of this.

18:43.034 --> 18:45.275
I need you
to be your fucking self.

18:45.275 --> 18:48.689
Let me tell you something,
you ugly bitch.

18:48.689 --> 18:50.448
Help me up.

18:50.448 --> 18:51.931
I will whup yo ass.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.103
You don't know me.
I am from Bethlehem.

18:54.103 --> 18:55.896
Uh-huh. You're lucky
I got my good bra on.

18:55.896 --> 18:57.793
Cut! That was very real.

18:59.241 --> 19:02.068
Like, I believed that.
And you're from Bethlehem?

19:02.068 --> 19:03.793
Should I just say Sparta or--

19:03.793 --> 19:05.758
-That could be funny.
-Okay, hey.

19:05.758 --> 19:08.206
Okay, here we go.
And action.

19:08.206 --> 19:09.862
You do not know me!

19:09.862 --> 19:11.034
-Bitch, help me up.
-You do not know me, bitch!

19:11.034 --> 19:12.206
Help me, help me up.

19:12.206 --> 19:13.586
I am from Sparta!

19:13.586 --> 19:15.103
-Bitch, hold up.
-Get off of me!

19:15.103 --> 19:17.827
This is not RuPaul's
Southern Hospitality Race!

19:19.034 --> 19:21.862
Angeria is turning it
the fuck out.

19:21.862 --> 19:23.000
-Yeah, I think it's great.
-Yeah.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.413
Let's see what
the rest of you've got.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.620
And action.

19:25.620 --> 19:28.068
I grew up
in a very liberal family,

19:28.068 --> 19:31.482
and when I came out as straight,
my dads disowned me.

19:31.482 --> 19:33.931
I just wanna let you know
we're all very glad you're here,

19:33.931 --> 19:35.275
but me in particular,

19:35.275 --> 19:38.482
because, you guys,
I have something to admit.

19:38.482 --> 19:40.586
I'm straight, too!

19:40.586 --> 19:42.551
-What?
-What?

19:42.551 --> 19:44.034
-Cut!
-All right.

19:44.034 --> 19:46.758
Maddy, that was very funny
when you said, "My dads."

19:46.758 --> 19:48.172
That's an extra layer of funny.

19:48.172 --> 19:50.655
Despite being in the bottom
last week,

19:50.655 --> 19:52.206
Maddy's honestly killing it.

19:52.206 --> 19:55.000
Okay, the next scene is what?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.655
Me and Orion.

19:56.655 --> 19:58.413
-It's a shade-throwing moment.
-Yeah.

19:58.413 --> 19:59.931
Okay, let's run through it.

19:59.931 --> 20:02.413
So, bitch, I think
you might be in the bottom.

20:02.413 --> 20:04.586
Because with that tuck,

20:04.586 --> 20:08.482
maybe you're gonna work
in a deli, bitch.

20:08.482 --> 20:11.000
I have never had a meaty tuck.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.275
If I wanted to get a meaty tuck,

20:12.275 --> 20:14.413
I would go out
and get a meaty tuck.

20:14.413 --> 20:17.758
Um...so you forgot
an important part of the line.

20:17.758 --> 20:18.965
What?

20:18.965 --> 20:20.655
She left out
the "meaty tuck" part.

20:20.655 --> 20:22.034
-Right.
-So if you don't say "meaty,"

20:22.034 --> 20:23.655
we won't get the "deli."

20:23.655 --> 20:26.344
Otherwise, you just said, "You
should be working at a deli,"

20:26.344 --> 20:27.758
and we're, like,
why should she work in a deli?

20:29.034 --> 20:31.793
No, no, no, okay, okay,
let me try again.

20:31.793 --> 20:33.793
Because with that meaty tuck.

20:33.793 --> 20:38.310
Alyssa is being over the top
and dramatic.

20:38.310 --> 20:41.827
You stupid bitch!
What are you doing to me?

20:41.827 --> 20:44.758
But she doesn't have that build.

20:44.758 --> 20:46.965
There's not really, like,
any, like, peaks and valleys.

20:48.379 --> 20:51.103
All right, Team Willow,

20:51.103 --> 20:53.620
it's time to shoot
your Untuckedscenes.

20:53.620 --> 20:56.034
For this one,
I have the realization

20:56.034 --> 20:57.655
that this is
RuPaul's Drag Race,

20:57.655 --> 20:58.758
and I thought
I was on the wrong show.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.758
That's the shocking revelation.

20:59.758 --> 21:00.827
-Yes.
-Okay.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.448
So, ladies, what challenges

21:02.448 --> 21:04.172
are we excited for
coming up this season?

21:04.172 --> 21:05.655
I know for me it's the ball.

21:05.655 --> 21:06.827
I wanna sew, sew, sew!

21:06.827 --> 21:08.724
Sewing, bitch,
I sewed this myself.

21:08.724 --> 21:10.034
-Ooh!
-You did?

21:10.034 --> 21:12.310
Sewing? I thought
this was the Bitchelor.

21:12.310 --> 21:14.482
Where's Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman?

21:14.482 --> 21:15.827
Girl, you got the wrong TV show.

21:15.827 --> 21:17.137
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!

21:17.137 --> 21:18.689
-Jeffrey?!
-Jeffrey, where are you?

21:18.689 --> 21:19.862
Look under the table.

21:19.862 --> 21:20.931
He might be under this table.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.689
I think he's...

21:22.689 --> 21:24.586
Could he be here?

21:24.586 --> 21:25.931
-No!
-What about here?

21:25.931 --> 21:27.275
Oh, Lord.

21:27.275 --> 21:29.793
Miss Willow, baby,
use a key, Miss Thing.

21:29.793 --> 21:31.482
Is he behind your hair?

21:31.482 --> 21:32.896
Jeffrey!

21:32.896 --> 21:34.000
Where's Jeffrey?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.758
-Is he in here?

21:35.758 --> 21:38.241
Please, Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman!

21:38.241 --> 21:39.517
And cut!

21:41.482 --> 21:42.551
That was really good.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.620
-Yay!
-Let's move on.

21:44.620 --> 21:47.000
So our next scene
is intense shade.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.413
-That's me and you.
-That's me and Kerri.

21:48.413 --> 21:50.620
Okay, let's try it. Action.

21:50.620 --> 21:52.241
Ooh, oh.

21:52.241 --> 21:53.655
Girl, can you shut the hell up?

21:53.655 --> 21:55.689
Sounding over there
like a baby, bitch.

21:55.689 --> 21:58.000
That's a lot
coming from a filler queen,

21:58.000 --> 21:59.724
and I'm not talking
about your face.

21:59.724 --> 22:01.379
Let me tell you something,

22:01.379 --> 22:03.413
Miss Bitch Only
a Mama's Face Could Love--

22:03.413 --> 22:04.896
I said that so wrong.

22:06.482 --> 22:08.689
Bitch with a face
only a mama could love.

22:08.689 --> 22:10.172
Don't let your hair
get in your way.

22:10.172 --> 22:11.413
Okay.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.517
You're paying way too much
attention to it.

22:12.517 --> 22:13.620
It'll just be flipped back.

22:13.620 --> 22:15.379
Do it like Cher would do.

22:15.379 --> 22:16.344
Ohh.

22:16.344 --> 22:17.758
That's a lot coming from you,

22:17.758 --> 22:19.862
the bitch with a face
only a mother could love.

22:19.862 --> 22:22.103
And cut. Try not
to get tongue-tied.

22:22.103 --> 22:24.137
-You're thinking too much.
-Yeah.

22:24.137 --> 22:25.103
You're reading a bitch.
Don't even think about it.

22:25.103 --> 22:26.655
Just read her.

22:26.655 --> 22:28.103
You're the bitch with a face
only a mother could love. Okay.

22:28.103 --> 22:29.482
Are you all right, Kerri?
You got it?

22:29.482 --> 22:31.103
Yes.

22:31.103 --> 22:36.241
Kerri pitched me this completely
indulged in herself character,

22:36.241 --> 22:40.344
but there's not quite enough
dimension and fun

22:40.344 --> 22:42.000
to the character.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.310
Okay, moving on.
Next one.

22:44.310 --> 22:47.482
No, girl, I just think that you,
like, might be in the bottom.

22:47.482 --> 22:48.655
Girl, why you think
I should be in the bottom?

22:48.655 --> 22:49.862
The hair.

22:49.862 --> 22:51.620
Girl, this hair
is sitting right, bitch.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.551
And then, like,
what about these?

22:54.551 --> 22:56.068
Bitch, it's a wormhole, ho.

22:56.068 --> 22:58.206
As I'm doing the challenge,

22:58.206 --> 22:59.620
I definitely feel like

22:59.620 --> 23:04.172
I'm... I'm not sure
if they like it or not.

23:04.172 --> 23:06.931
I might wanna get
a little bit personal with you.

23:06.931 --> 23:09.068
Girl, you better not, you bitch!

23:09.068 --> 23:11.896
I just really hope it's
good--it's good enough.

23:11.896 --> 23:13.965
Oh, catfight.

23:13.965 --> 23:16.172
Okay, I think that will
cut into something.

23:16.172 --> 23:19.034
Who's up next, y'all?

23:19.034 --> 23:21.517
I have the legendary
rant moment,

23:21.517 --> 23:22.862
and I'm playing off
of Silky's whole moment.

23:22.862 --> 23:25.517
If we had to lip sync,
I was ready to do so.

23:25.517 --> 23:26.793
If I would have lip synced

23:26.793 --> 23:28.931
for my motherfucking life
today, bitch,

23:28.931 --> 23:31.655
I was motherfucking ready!

23:31.655 --> 23:33.586
I was ready to do so!

23:33.586 --> 23:35.551
When nobody even asked
the bitch to lip sync?

23:35.551 --> 23:36.586
-Right.
-Great.

23:36.586 --> 23:38.620
All right, here we go. Action.

23:38.620 --> 23:40.551
Well, real tea now.

23:40.551 --> 23:42.000
Who do y'all think
is in the bottom?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.241
Uh, bottom.

23:43.241 --> 23:44.586
-Kornbread.
-Kornbread!

23:44.586 --> 23:46.413
What you mean, y'all think
I'm in the bottom?

23:46.413 --> 23:48.724
You know, them judges
asked us if we needed to eat,

23:48.724 --> 23:50.862
I would have ate
all you ho's, bitch.

23:50.862 --> 23:52.241
Show me your rolls.

23:52.241 --> 23:54.551
Bitch, you ain't got rolls
like me, bitch, do you?

23:54.551 --> 23:56.137
If the judges said
we needed to eat, I woulda eat.

23:56.137 --> 23:57.379
Show me your chops!

23:57.379 --> 23:59.482
Bitch, I got pork chops, ho!

24:00.965 --> 24:03.689
This thing with Kornbread
in this challenge

24:03.689 --> 24:05.379
is she is very funny.

24:05.379 --> 24:06.655
You got anything
in your titties?

24:06.655 --> 24:08.482
No, bitch I got shit
in my titties, too.

24:08.482 --> 24:10.206
Look, we got fish and chips, ho.

24:10.206 --> 24:12.862
But I don't think
she has any levels.

24:12.862 --> 24:15.034
It's not anything

24:15.034 --> 24:17.103
other than just Kornbread
on a normal day.

24:17.103 --> 24:20.000
I got potatoes
in my titties. Watch.

24:21.655 --> 24:24.310
-Mashed potato, ho!
-Cut.

24:24.310 --> 24:26.103
I'm gonna assume
that was a single take thing.

24:28.896 --> 24:31.586
It's hard to tell
what this finished product

24:31.586 --> 24:32.931
is gonna look like.

24:32.931 --> 24:35.241
Thank you. Thank you, ladies.
That's a wrap.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.862
There were moments where
we were not funny at all,

24:37.862 --> 24:39.586
and there were moments
where we were hilarious.

24:39.586 --> 24:40.620
See you on the main stage.

24:40.620 --> 24:42.517
And so, I can't wait

24:42.517 --> 24:45.620
to see what the hell
we just did.

24:45.620 --> 24:47.413
Coming up...

24:47.413 --> 24:50.000
Ooh, girl.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.551
Bitch, is that for real?

24:51.551 --> 24:53.172
I don't know what's
about to take place,

24:53.172 --> 24:55.655
but, girl,
I don't think I'm ready.

24:55.655 --> 24:56.931
I don't think nobody ready.

25:06.275 --> 25:08.965
Ooh, another day, ladies.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.379
Ooh, we're here!

25:10.379 --> 25:12.413
It is another elimination day,

25:12.413 --> 25:14.896
and one of these ho's
gonna have to sashay away.

25:14.896 --> 25:16.379
We're walking into the werkroom,

25:16.379 --> 25:19.551
and after filming everything,
my body is aching.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.137
But I don't wanna complain

25:21.137 --> 25:22.551
because I'm not
the complaining type.

25:23.620 --> 25:24.896
I do not feel good

25:24.896 --> 25:27.000
about what I did
in the super tease,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.310
but I'm excited,
because today's runway

25:29.310 --> 25:31.034
is the Night of A Thousand JLos.

25:31.034 --> 25:34.034
Let's get into this mug, bitch!

25:34.034 --> 25:35.724
Let's get loud,
as JLo would say.

25:38.448 --> 25:40.068
I've done two pageants.

25:40.068 --> 25:42.931
One of them was a celebrity
impersonation pageant.

25:42.931 --> 25:45.068
I did JLo, of course,
and I won.

25:45.068 --> 25:47.068
That's just me. I'm JLo.

25:47.068 --> 25:48.344
So I'm just like, fuck,

25:48.344 --> 25:50.482
I have so much pressure
on my ass right now.

25:50.482 --> 25:52.965
I really do need
to bring it this runway.

25:56.241 --> 25:58.000
-Can I say this, Jasmine?
-Yeah.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.413
I was really confused when
you did go to the other team,

26:00.413 --> 26:02.931
because I was like, is this
a tactic she's playing?

26:02.931 --> 26:05.137
When I was picked last,
I wanted to prove

26:05.137 --> 26:06.655
that, like, I can quiet down

26:06.655 --> 26:09.172
when it comes
to, like, a team thing.

26:09.172 --> 26:11.448
So I'm definitely trying
to ask a question,

26:11.448 --> 26:13.344
listen to what a girl
has to say,

26:13.344 --> 26:14.965
and then respond.

26:14.965 --> 26:16.931
Because running my mouth
back and forth,

26:16.931 --> 26:19.413
it's not really conducive
for a work environment,

26:19.413 --> 26:21.379
and on top of it, not conducive

26:21.379 --> 26:24.068
to start relationships
and friendships, you know?

26:24.068 --> 26:27.000
You and Miss Bread had a
little bit of an intense start,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.172
but I do think,
like, by the end of it,

26:29.172 --> 26:31.517
both of you
had, like, figured out

26:31.517 --> 26:32.724
how do we, like, work together?

26:32.724 --> 26:34.862
All tea,
like, I wanted to prove

26:34.862 --> 26:37.517
that I can sit back and listen

26:37.517 --> 26:39.413
and at the same time

26:39.413 --> 26:41.620
put my two cents in when
it's needed, rather than--

26:41.620 --> 26:44.241
I'm still waiting on the sitting
back and listening part.

26:44.241 --> 26:47.620
You still talk a lot,
but it ain't too bad, bitch.

26:49.482 --> 26:50.413
I don't think
there's any tension

26:50.413 --> 26:51.862
between Jasmine Kennedie and I.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.862
I actually think we all mesh
pretty well together.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.379
Now, I will say this.

26:55.379 --> 26:58.551
If we got paid for words,
Jasmine Kennedie would be rich.

27:02.206 --> 27:04.586
-So, Miss Maddy.
-Yes?

27:04.586 --> 27:06.758
Do you have your dad's support,
like, as a drag queen?

27:06.758 --> 27:08.758
I've always been, like,
really close to my dad.

27:08.758 --> 27:10.034
He was, like,
my idol growing up.

27:10.034 --> 27:11.586
I honestly don't know
100% how he feels

27:11.586 --> 27:14.620
about me doing drag, but I know
he supports me in general.

27:14.620 --> 27:16.448
-We need that support.
-Yeah.

27:16.448 --> 27:20.000
Like, I'm very lucky to have
a father that supports me a lot.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.896
Like, it's crazy, because
I was, like, 15 years old,

27:22.896 --> 27:24.172
and, you know, as a young kid,

27:24.172 --> 27:27.172
I put some porn things
in my computer,

27:27.172 --> 27:30.517
and my dad one day,
he saw all the things.

27:30.517 --> 27:31.655
Like the dicks and--

27:33.344 --> 27:37.068
So my dad told me,
can you--can we talk?

27:37.068 --> 27:38.793
And I was, fuck.

27:38.793 --> 27:40.241
I was busted.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.620
And I was, "Papi, no,
I have a girlfriend, Papi.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.172
No, I'm not gay,"
blah, blah, blah.

27:44.172 --> 27:46.862
And he told me,
"I am like you."

27:46.862 --> 27:48.448
Like, "I'm gay."

27:48.448 --> 27:50.034
Wait. So you and your dad,

27:50.034 --> 27:51.103
you basically, like,
came out to each other?

27:51.103 --> 27:52.275
Yeah.

27:52.275 --> 27:53.965
-Yeah. Yeah, literally.
-That's crazy.

27:53.965 --> 27:54.965
That's so crazy.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.413
He, you know, hugged me.

27:56.413 --> 27:58.689
And he told me,
"I'm here for you."

27:58.689 --> 28:00.793
Like, "Don't be afraid
of being you."

28:00.793 --> 28:01.896
My dad is my best friend,

28:01.896 --> 28:05.379
goes to my shows
and my pageants.

28:05.379 --> 28:09.034
My dad is the reason
that I am very strong in life.

28:09.034 --> 28:11.655
He teach me a lot
to be a strong person,

28:11.655 --> 28:14.413
and just to follow my dreams.

28:14.413 --> 28:15.896
I am very grateful

28:15.896 --> 28:18.517
to have my pageant queen mom
and my gay father.

28:18.517 --> 28:19.862
It's, like,
a great combination.

28:19.862 --> 28:21.034
It's a perfect combination.

28:21.034 --> 28:22.413
I'm here for a reason.

28:26.068 --> 28:27.344
The auntie corner, bitch.

28:27.344 --> 28:28.793
Alyssa got a nice
little package on her.

28:28.793 --> 28:29.827
Sho' do.

28:29.827 --> 28:31.448
What? What did you say?

28:31.448 --> 28:33.586
I said you got a nice
little package on you, bitch.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.206
How did you saw it?

28:35.206 --> 28:36.689
I'm a birdwatcher, honey.

28:36.689 --> 28:38.620
There ain't no male-gendered
anything around me

28:38.620 --> 28:41.034
that does not get scoped
for a second, bitch.

28:41.034 --> 28:42.758
I am a birdwatcher.

28:42.758 --> 28:45.137
At this point, we are on

28:45.137 --> 28:48.000
a whole 'nother level
of auntie energy, bitch,

28:48.000 --> 28:49.137
and you know aunties.

28:49.137 --> 28:50.551
We're here
to talk a little shit,

28:50.551 --> 28:51.931
give a little advice,

28:51.931 --> 28:53.482
give you a hug if you need it,

28:53.482 --> 28:55.275
and we're gonna have some fun,

28:55.275 --> 28:57.965
'cause we're trying to get
to heaven, bitch.

28:57.965 --> 28:59.827
Baby, I was watching
the birds today.

28:59.827 --> 29:02.172
The owl was poking out
the tree, hon, talking hoo-hoo.

29:02.172 --> 29:05.172
Owls, woodpeckers, bitch,
just everything.

29:05.172 --> 29:06.586
Going hoo, hoo.
Hoo hoo there?

29:06.586 --> 29:07.793
What's a woodpecker?

29:07.793 --> 29:09.103
What do you mean by that?

29:09.103 --> 29:11.689
We're talking about
being birdwatchers.

29:11.689 --> 29:13.275
What is that lingo?
What does that mean?

29:13.275 --> 29:15.827
Birdwatcher means you watching
the boys' birds, girl.

29:15.827 --> 29:17.103
-Gray sweatpants.
-The birds.

29:17.103 --> 29:18.758
Yeah, we gotta look for it.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.379
Look for it, find it?

29:20.379 --> 29:22.586
Yeah, we're like, bitch, yeah,
we're watching birds, girl.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.724
Not like toucans.

29:24.724 --> 29:26.965
My favorite bird to watch
is a ostrich, bitch.

29:26.965 --> 29:28.655
Oh, a long neck.

29:28.655 --> 29:30.206
-Yes.

29:30.206 --> 29:31.551
And a big body.

29:34.620 --> 29:36.586
Ooh, girl.

29:36.586 --> 29:38.758
She done already
done had herses.

29:38.758 --> 29:40.517
-What?
-Is that a glitch?

29:40.517 --> 29:42.241
Bitch, is that for real?

29:42.241 --> 29:44.379
I don't know
what's about to take place,

29:44.379 --> 29:46.172
but, girl,
I don't think I'm ready.

29:46.172 --> 29:48.344
I don't think nobody ready.

29:48.344 --> 29:50.482
Aah!

29:50.482 --> 29:52.482
Hey, queens.

29:55.172 --> 29:57.241
JLo. Oh, my...

29:59.344 --> 30:00.758
She looks so good.

30:00.758 --> 30:02.724
She's glowing,
the hair's right.

30:02.724 --> 30:04.586
I lo-lo-love her.

30:06.034 --> 30:08.482
I hear you're doing
A Night of A Thousand JLos.

30:08.482 --> 30:10.206
Yes, ma'am.

30:10.206 --> 30:11.413
I am so excited for this.

30:11.413 --> 30:13.586
It's gonna be an honor
to see you all

30:13.586 --> 30:16.172
serving up my favorite looks
from the past.

30:16.172 --> 30:18.448
But before we get
this party started,

30:18.448 --> 30:20.172
I wanna give you
a little advice

30:20.172 --> 30:21.655
from one queen to another.

30:21.655 --> 30:24.379
-Don't be afraid to get loud.

30:24.379 --> 30:26.379
Be proud, and shake it.

30:28.310 --> 30:30.103
Now go out there and be fierce.

30:30.103 --> 30:32.172
-Yes!
-But not too fierce.

30:32.172 --> 30:34.655
There can only be
one Jenny from the block.

30:35.758 --> 30:37.551
Marry me, JLo!

30:38.896 --> 30:41.379
Okay, queens,
make me proud and have fun.

30:44.586 --> 30:47.413
Seeing JLo gives me
a new excitement

30:47.413 --> 30:48.827
about hitting this runway,

30:48.827 --> 30:51.000
because we did struggle
a little bit throughout the day,

30:51.000 --> 30:52.482
and right now,
I'm just gonna focus on

30:52.482 --> 30:54.758
giving you JLo
glamour and beauty,

30:54.758 --> 30:58.482
and hope that we can
make up for it with that.

31:00.689 --> 31:02.034
Coming up...

31:02.034 --> 31:04.275
This JLo look is beautiful.

31:04.275 --> 31:07.206
This is a look
that is not Jennifer.

31:07.206 --> 31:10.655
I don't wanna see any more
flip-flops on my stage!

31:37.862 --> 31:40.551
-Werk it!
-We are in Xanadu!

31:40.551 --> 31:44.000
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.517
Michelle Visage. Now, do you
consider yourself a tease?

31:47.517 --> 31:49.965
Well, there are
worse things I could do

31:49.965 --> 31:52.724
than go with a boy
or two...thousand.

31:53.965 --> 31:57.344
And the hilarious
Ross Mathews.

31:57.344 --> 31:59.689
Ross, have you ever met JLo?

31:59.689 --> 32:00.827
Have I met her?

32:00.827 --> 32:02.482
Ru, I was engaged to her!

32:02.482 --> 32:03.931
How'd that work out?

32:03.931 --> 32:05.620
Same old story. Two tops.

32:08.103 --> 32:10.758
And everybody say Loni Love!

32:10.758 --> 32:11.793
Loni, welcome back.

32:11.793 --> 32:13.655
Oh, Ru, I never left.

32:13.655 --> 32:15.310
I've been here since Season 13.

32:15.310 --> 32:17.275
See, if you stay ready,

32:17.275 --> 32:19.413
you ain't never
got to get ready.

32:19.413 --> 32:21.862
That's right.
There you go.

32:21.862 --> 32:24.172
This week
we challenged our queens

32:24.172 --> 32:28.965
to create two gag-worthy
Season 14 super teases.

32:28.965 --> 32:30.379
And tonight on the runway,

32:30.379 --> 32:34.724
category is Night
of A Thousand JLos.

32:34.724 --> 32:35.896
Ooh!

32:35.896 --> 32:37.862
Racers, start your engines,

32:37.862 --> 32:40.103
and may the best drag queen win.

32:44.724 --> 32:50.517
First up, Willow Pill,
JLo, Grammys, 1998.

32:50.517 --> 32:54.034
Butterflies?
Take that, Mariah!

32:54.034 --> 32:56.172
I am loving
my JLo look.

32:56.172 --> 32:59.241
There's something very sweet
and virginal about it.

32:59.241 --> 33:03.586
I've got my little butterflies
on my toes and on my purse.

33:03.586 --> 33:05.275
I've got my ass.

33:05.275 --> 33:07.241
Of course, you have to have
the ass if you're gonna be JLo.

33:07.241 --> 33:08.482
RuPaul:
Ooh, look at all that ass.

33:08.482 --> 33:10.862
Oh, there's
always room for JLo.

33:12.965 --> 33:17.586
Kornbread with a "K,"
Met Gala, 2018.

33:17.586 --> 33:21.103
Well, you know, the theme
that year was heavenly booties.

33:21.103 --> 33:24.068
Oh, baby,
y'all can't take it.

33:24.068 --> 33:25.965
I got the cross
written up on this chest

33:25.965 --> 33:27.517
because y'all know
I'm a holy ho.

33:27.517 --> 33:30.241
It is black stones
all over this mesh,

33:30.241 --> 33:32.620
so I'm feeling my body
and my oats.

33:32.620 --> 33:36.793
The holy trinity:
hot water, cornbread, kush.

33:38.793 --> 33:43.517
Lady Camden,
CFDA Awards, 2019.

33:43.517 --> 33:46.275
Someone's
got a coral fixation.

33:46.275 --> 33:48.724
To me,
this is such a moment

33:48.724 --> 33:50.482
of glamour and color,

33:50.482 --> 33:53.000
but it also was, like, a little
sporty kind of silhouette.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.448
And honestly, this color
is just so gorgeous.

33:55.448 --> 33:56.793
I feel so expensive.

33:56.793 --> 33:59.689
She's just Genie
from the block.

34:01.137 --> 34:02.931
I wonder if this
was made in Manhattan?

34:04.413 --> 34:07.862
Bosco.
2009 Golden Globes.

34:07.862 --> 34:10.103
Oh, this gold thing?

34:10.103 --> 34:11.620
This is the JLo fantasy

34:11.620 --> 34:13.586
through the lens that is Bosco.

34:13.586 --> 34:19.068
I am serving wet gold Versace,
rich as fucking luxury.

34:19.068 --> 34:23.482
And I absolutely have my
Golden Globes front and center.

34:23.482 --> 34:24.862
Putting the ass

34:24.862 --> 34:27.482
in the Hollywood
Foreign Press Ass-ociation.

34:28.620 --> 34:30.413
Long way to go,
but there was a payoff.

34:30.413 --> 34:32.379
We got you there.
I got you there.

34:32.379 --> 34:35.275
Kerri Colby,
Versace, Spring 2020.

34:35.275 --> 34:38.206
Oh, I've never
seen this one before.

34:39.931 --> 34:42.068
Bitch, nobody's gonna
be giving more JLo than me.

34:42.068 --> 34:43.586
I am presenting you

34:43.586 --> 34:48.275
the 2020 Versace
redemption runway dress.

34:48.275 --> 34:53.275
IfVogue does not repost this,
I'm going to lose my shit.

34:53.275 --> 34:56.310
This is the dress that
launched Google Image Search.

34:56.310 --> 34:57.758
I remember.

34:57.758 --> 35:00.793
RuPaul:
Jorgeous, Super Bowl 2020.

35:00.793 --> 35:02.827
She's doing
some self-reflection.

35:04.241 --> 35:07.172
Girl, I am living
my JLo fantasy.

35:07.172 --> 35:10.448
I'm giving you some dance moves
that JLo actually does.

35:10.448 --> 35:13.172
I want the judges to get
every angle of this outfit,

35:13.172 --> 35:15.620
because, girl, it's shining
in the right places.

35:15.620 --> 35:17.172
I'm showing body, bitch.

35:17.172 --> 35:20.241
I'm selling you JLo down.

35:20.241 --> 35:21.931
Well, once a flygirl,
always a flygirl.

35:21.931 --> 35:23.310
That's right.

35:23.310 --> 35:25.000
This is her second act.

35:26.344 --> 35:28.034
Ah, I love it.

35:28.034 --> 35:32.068
RuPaul:
Jasmine Kennedie, AMAs, 2015.

35:32.068 --> 35:33.862
She's in the pocket.

35:33.862 --> 35:35.965
This gown
is beautifully constructed.

35:35.965 --> 35:38.965
It is a high-collared
Christian Dior silhouette,

35:38.965 --> 35:42.172
and the shoes, if you peep
the bottom, are Louboutins.

35:42.172 --> 35:44.724
I just feel JLorgeous.

35:44.724 --> 35:45.931
J-Sparkle.

35:47.172 --> 35:51.517
Maddy Morphosis,
2021 Inauguration.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.689
Is someone gonna
tell her it's after Labor Day?

35:53.689 --> 35:56.517
I have just stepped out
on the Capitol steps

35:56.517 --> 35:59.206
in all white,
from my white beret

35:59.206 --> 36:02.241
all the way own to my sequined
white palazzo pants.

36:02.241 --> 36:06.379
I am feeling elegant, and just
like JLo at the Inauguration,

36:06.379 --> 36:08.758
the moment
is all about me right now.

36:08.758 --> 36:11.241
RuPaul:
Sing "America the Bootyful."

36:12.448 --> 36:15.965
RuPaul:
DeJa Skye, VMAs, 2018.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.068
Are you mad at me?

36:17.068 --> 36:19.551
You keep giving me
a gold shoulder.

36:19.551 --> 36:24.724
I stomp onto this runway,
and bam, that's right,

36:24.724 --> 36:27.379
I am a thick-ass JLo.

36:27.379 --> 36:31.275
And you can't take this makeup,
bitch, because it's on fleek.

36:31.275 --> 36:32.448
Do people say that anymore?

36:32.448 --> 36:34.137
She's just Jenny
from the tuck.

36:36.206 --> 36:39.034
Daya Betty,
Super Bowl 2020.

36:39.034 --> 36:40.827
Michelle:
Is the bike still running?

36:42.620 --> 36:46.758
I have this beautiful,
vivacious JLo wig,

36:46.758 --> 36:50.379
I have a nice, big booty,
so I'm feeling sexy

36:50.379 --> 36:52.551
and I'm giving you
Betty from the block.

36:52.551 --> 36:54.103
You know who won
the 2020 Super Bowl?

36:54.103 --> 36:56.034
-Who?
-JLo.

36:57.482 --> 37:03.482
Angeria Paris
VanMicheals, Met Gala, 2019.

37:03.482 --> 37:06.931
Don't be fooled
by the rocks that I got.

37:06.931 --> 37:09.310
And by "rocks,"
you mean "titties," right?

37:10.724 --> 37:12.241
Baby,
she don't need no hair.

37:12.241 --> 37:14.551
I got me
a whole rhinestone wig.

37:14.551 --> 37:18.206
The dress is fitted, she
is sparkling down this runway.

37:18.206 --> 37:22.586
I'm giving you class
and sass and ass. Yes!

37:22.586 --> 37:24.793
Love don't cost
a thing, but she do.

37:24.793 --> 37:26.172
Mm-hmm.

37:26.172 --> 37:30.862
Alyssa Hunter,
2018 Billboard Awards.

37:30.862 --> 37:33.034
-!¡Dinero!
-Yes!

37:33.034 --> 37:34.551
Oh, she a hustler.

37:34.551 --> 37:36.724
I feel like
a rich bitch right now.

37:36.724 --> 37:38.793
I love the pants with the hat.

37:38.793 --> 37:40.793
I'm feeling my gangster vibe,

37:40.793 --> 37:44.793
and then, pop, I have revealed
bling, bling, bling.

37:44.793 --> 37:47.310
Baby, you can't
say me anything.

37:47.310 --> 37:48.689
Fedora?

37:48.689 --> 37:49.793
Michelle:
I don't even know her!

37:51.482 --> 37:56.655
Orion Story,
HRC Dinner, 2013.

37:56.655 --> 37:58.896
Loni:
Jennifer at a dinner-fer.

37:58.896 --> 38:03.413
I am just giving you
all of the glamour tonight.

38:03.413 --> 38:05.655
It's a full red velvet gown

38:05.655 --> 38:08.724
with hand-stoned
vine work done by me.

38:08.724 --> 38:10.965
Baby, it's over.

38:10.965 --> 38:13.310
It looks like
she's got great circulation.

38:13.310 --> 38:16.586
That reminds me.
I gotta de-vein my shrimp.

38:19.655 --> 38:21.206
Coming up...

38:21.206 --> 38:22.275
You look so beautiful.

38:22.275 --> 38:23.586
Sexy, it's her.

38:23.586 --> 38:25.862
Two words: Gorg Orwell.

38:33.965 --> 38:36.137
Welcome, ladies.

38:36.137 --> 38:37.517
Let's take a look

38:37.517 --> 38:40.862
at the Drag Race
Season 14 super tease

38:40.862 --> 38:43.034
by Team Willow Pill.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.379
This season
on RuPaul'sDrag Race,

38:47.379 --> 38:50.482
a new batch of bitches
is here to claim the crown.

38:50.482 --> 38:53.724
Here comes America's sweetheart.

38:53.724 --> 38:56.689
If y'all wanna pop,
you came to the wrong place,

38:56.689 --> 38:58.310
Ow.

38:58.310 --> 39:00.896
My catheter is leaking.

39:00.896 --> 39:04.862
This group is b-b-busted.

39:04.862 --> 39:07.758
With talent that
will leave you gagging.

39:07.758 --> 39:10.034
This one's for Carson.

39:11.172 --> 39:12.172
More catfights...

39:12.172 --> 39:13.482
I miss my boyfriend so much.

39:13.482 --> 39:14.551
I just wanna cuddle him,
hug him, squeeze him--

39:14.551 --> 39:15.896
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

39:15.896 --> 39:17.310
You're the one with the face

39:17.310 --> 39:18.896
only a mother could love, bitch!

39:18.896 --> 39:20.517
Who needs a face

39:20.517 --> 39:22.862
when you have a body
like peeled string cheese?

39:22.862 --> 39:24.275
Girl, what the fuck
kind of body is this?

39:24.275 --> 39:26.620
Bitch, I know you like this.
It's a lot of ass, ho.

39:26.620 --> 39:29.724
I'm gonna need some sugar
for this pipin' hot tea.

39:29.724 --> 39:31.793
More shocking revelations...

39:31.793 --> 39:34.827
What is RuPaul's Drag Race?

39:34.827 --> 39:36.896
I thought
this was the Bitchelor.

39:36.896 --> 39:40.655
I was promised a chance at love
and a daily meal voucher.

39:40.655 --> 39:43.758
Where's Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman?
Jeffrey?

39:43.758 --> 39:45.896
Where are you, baby?
Jeffrey?

39:45.896 --> 39:47.310
Jeffrey, are you in here?

39:47.310 --> 39:49.586
I cannot find him!

39:49.586 --> 39:54.172
And the most insincere apology
inDrag Race herstory!

39:54.172 --> 39:56.241
I am so sorry, girl,

39:56.241 --> 39:58.655
that you are not me.

39:58.655 --> 40:03.724
It must be so hard
for you to look in the mirror

40:03.724 --> 40:05.482
and not see what I see.

40:05.482 --> 40:07.172
Girl, I hope she knows

40:07.172 --> 40:09.827
that she ain't the only gorgeous
one up in this gig, mama.

40:10.827 --> 40:12.413
And challenges too hot for TV!

40:12.413 --> 40:15.310
Nurse? Nurse!

40:15.310 --> 40:18.793
I don't really know if I'm
qualified to be a brain surgeon,

40:18.793 --> 40:21.241
but I really don't wanna
go home tonight.

40:21.241 --> 40:23.620
Y'all had a fat bitch
out there running.

40:23.620 --> 40:25.379
I needed a snack.

40:25.379 --> 40:27.068
Wait for me!

40:27.068 --> 40:30.620
Just when you thought it was
safe to go back to the runway--

40:30.620 --> 40:33.793
I don't wanna see any more
flip-flops on my stage!

40:33.793 --> 40:37.137
Plus, a whole lot
of ugly crying.

40:37.137 --> 40:38.586
No!

40:38.586 --> 40:41.206
Aah!

40:44.586 --> 40:45.931
God bless America.

40:45.931 --> 40:47.551
Fasten yo seatbelts

40:47.551 --> 40:50.965
and get ready for the ride
of yo mother-tuckin' life.

40:50.965 --> 40:53.793
Oh, and remember, if you're
not watchingUntucked,

40:53.793 --> 40:56.000
you're only getting
half the story.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.620
If the judges said
we needed to eat, I woulda eat.

40:57.620 --> 40:58.896
Show me your chops.

40:58.896 --> 41:01.275
Bitch, I got pork chops, ho!

41:01.275 --> 41:03.137
Where the fuck
did she get the pork chops?

41:03.137 --> 41:05.862
Show me your fish and chips,
motherfucker!

41:08.034 --> 41:10.344
RuPaul's Drag Race
Season 14:

41:10.344 --> 41:12.310
Don't say we didn't warn you.

41:12.310 --> 41:13.620
I need love!

41:16.931 --> 41:18.241
Whoo!

41:18.241 --> 41:22.620
All right, next up,
Team Maddy Morphosis.

41:22.620 --> 41:25.344
This season
onRuPaul's Drag Race,

41:25.344 --> 41:28.103
a new batch of bitches
is here to claim the crown.

41:28.103 --> 41:31.034
La Latina's in the house,
!¡puñeta!

41:32.724 --> 41:35.482
The dancing queen is here.

41:35.482 --> 41:37.896
Is this the audition
for AJ and the Queen?

41:37.896 --> 41:39.551
They better bring in
the tissues,

41:39.551 --> 41:42.206
because we got
a lot of boogers up in here.

41:42.206 --> 41:44.896
With talent that
will leave you gagging.

41:52.137 --> 41:55.275
There was not even a fucking
trace of a tune in there.

41:55.275 --> 41:57.068
-What?
-More drama...

41:57.068 --> 41:59.931
You were the reason
that the fight started.

41:59.931 --> 42:03.137
Let me tell you something,
you ugly bitch.

42:03.137 --> 42:04.862
I will whup yo ass!

42:04.862 --> 42:06.517
I am from Sparta!

42:06.517 --> 42:08.103
I'll stomp on you like Godzilla!

42:09.620 --> 42:12.137
This is not RuPaul's
Southern Hospitality Race!

42:12.137 --> 42:14.206
You're lucky
I got my good bra on.

42:14.206 --> 42:15.724
Girl, get off of me.

42:15.724 --> 42:17.379
More confessions...

42:17.379 --> 42:19.655
It's been really hard
to say this, but...

42:19.655 --> 42:21.965
I'm straight, too.

42:23.206 --> 42:26.275
Not only is Orion
my drag persona...

42:26.275 --> 42:28.827
she's actually
the love of my life.

42:30.965 --> 42:33.103
-Oh!
-Ooh!

42:33.103 --> 42:35.448
And the most
insincere confession

42:35.448 --> 42:36.862
inDrag Race herstory.

42:36.862 --> 42:38.275
This is very emotional for me,

42:38.275 --> 42:41.310
because I was born
at a very young age.

42:41.310 --> 42:44.310
The first two years of my life,
I couldn't even walk.

42:44.310 --> 42:46.344
I couldn't even fend for myself.

42:46.344 --> 42:47.965
There would be times--

42:47.965 --> 42:49.793
I remember it so well--

42:49.793 --> 42:53.068
there would be times
that I would wake up

42:53.068 --> 42:55.206
and there would just be
shit in my pants.

42:55.206 --> 42:56.827
Look on the bright side.

42:56.827 --> 43:00.379
You've really grown...a lot.

43:00.379 --> 43:02.689
And challenges
that will make you wonder

43:02.689 --> 43:05.275
who's coming up
with this stuff?

43:05.275 --> 43:06.413
Oh, she's bucking!

43:06.413 --> 43:08.413
Gimme sexy cat
using a litterbox.

43:08.413 --> 43:10.275
I love it.

43:11.931 --> 43:13.448
And just when you thought

43:13.448 --> 43:15.206
it was safe to go back
to the runway--

43:15.206 --> 43:17.689
I worked really, really hard
on this outfit.

43:17.689 --> 43:19.931
Silence!
To put you in your place,

43:19.931 --> 43:23.137
you'll be lip syncing
for your life

43:23.137 --> 43:25.517
against me.

43:26.896 --> 43:29.551
Plus, a whole lot
of ugly crying.

43:40.965 --> 43:42.655
Fasten yo seatbelts

43:42.655 --> 43:46.000
and get ready for the ride
of your mother-tuckin' life.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.206
-Bitch!
-Oh!

43:48.206 --> 43:50.482
!¡Ai, estúpida!

43:52.379 --> 43:54.103
Why did you do that to me?

43:54.103 --> 43:56.931
RuPaul's Drag Race
Season 14:

43:56.931 --> 43:59.413
The struggle is real, henny.

44:01.517 --> 44:04.103
I don't wanna do this anymore.

44:04.103 --> 44:05.896
Aah!

44:10.482 --> 44:12.827
Oh, my God!

44:12.827 --> 44:15.068
I really love
an educational program.

44:16.827 --> 44:18.344
Coming up...

44:18.344 --> 44:20.862
-You're a little actress.
-I believed every word you said.

44:20.862 --> 44:23.517
You can do more
than just the food jokes.

44:29.965 --> 44:33.931
Ladies, this week
you competed as teams,

44:33.931 --> 44:37.586
but tonight
you'll be judged individually.

44:38.931 --> 44:41.241
When I call your name,
please step forward.

44:42.758 --> 44:45.206
Lady Camden.

44:45.206 --> 44:47.034
Bosco.

44:47.034 --> 44:48.827
Jorgeous.

44:48.827 --> 44:50.517
Jasmine Kennedie.

44:50.517 --> 44:51.827
Maddy Morphosis.

44:51.827 --> 44:54.310
Daya Betty.

44:54.310 --> 44:56.931
Orion Story.

44:56.931 --> 44:59.896
Ladies, you are safe.

45:02.482 --> 45:04.000
You may leave the stage.

45:08.482 --> 45:10.793
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

45:10.793 --> 45:13.206
starting with Willow Pill.

45:13.206 --> 45:16.827
I'm the comedy person,
and this acting challenge,

45:16.827 --> 45:21.034
you just went all-in, and it
actually made me laugh out loud.

45:21.034 --> 45:22.689
It's a ridiculous scenario.

45:22.689 --> 45:25.275
I was promised
a daily meal voucher.

45:25.275 --> 45:26.896
But if you can sell it,
it works,

45:26.896 --> 45:29.034
and tonight,
it just worked for you.

45:29.034 --> 45:30.551
You're a little actress.

45:30.551 --> 45:32.448
And tonight on the runway,

45:32.448 --> 45:36.620
this is a look
that is not so top-of-mind

45:36.620 --> 45:40.103
when you think of Jennifer,
and I thought you did it drag.

45:40.103 --> 45:43.551
Why'd you pick that look
of all JLo's looks?

45:43.551 --> 45:46.241
I think because
it's a little bit ugly.

45:50.724 --> 45:52.172
Thank you.

45:52.172 --> 45:54.172
Up next, Kornbread with a "K."

45:54.172 --> 45:55.172
Hey.

45:55.172 --> 45:57.241
Tonight, you look so beautiful.

45:57.241 --> 45:58.551
-Thank you.
-I think it's really true

45:58.551 --> 46:01.862
to the inspiration
of JLo's look.

46:01.862 --> 46:03.862
In the challenge,
you were fun to watch.

46:03.862 --> 46:05.034
Thank you.

46:05.034 --> 46:06.758
But you tend to go
right to 100

46:06.758 --> 46:10.103
instead of just
gassing it a little bit.

46:10.103 --> 46:12.793
So I think we needed
a little more texture and color

46:12.793 --> 46:14.172
instead of all the way there.

46:14.172 --> 46:16.793
I would not be a comic

46:16.793 --> 46:19.241
if I didn't tell you
what I'm about to tell you.

46:19.241 --> 46:22.344
I know that you can do more
than just the food jokes.

46:22.344 --> 46:26.310
Fat jokes are funny,
but if you wanna stay here,

46:26.310 --> 46:28.275
you're gonna
have to trust yourself

46:28.275 --> 46:31.000
to do other things
that isn't one-note.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.482
I think it's time
for you to show

46:33.482 --> 46:36.517
some of the things that
you may be afraid to show.

46:36.517 --> 46:38.931
Not just for this competition,
just for you.

46:40.206 --> 46:42.620
It's just every time
I get on the stage,

46:42.620 --> 46:44.379
it's like I'm over-filled
with emotion.

46:44.379 --> 46:48.137
The first week, when
I was, like, extremely happy,

46:48.137 --> 46:50.793
I think that opened up
a box of emotions

46:50.793 --> 46:52.310
I didn't know were there.

46:52.310 --> 46:55.000
Because where I'm from
and how I was raised up,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.965
you're not allowed
to show happiness.

46:57.965 --> 46:59.448
But, like, also,
that opened up the box

46:59.448 --> 47:02.517
of how much shit
I've dealt with in my life.

47:02.517 --> 47:04.068
Yes. Yes.

47:04.068 --> 47:07.241
And I thought I got over it
because I pushed it away.

47:07.241 --> 47:09.034
And, like, now coming here,

47:09.034 --> 47:10.620
and it's just, like, listening
to everybody's stories,

47:10.620 --> 47:13.103
they clicked something in me.

47:13.103 --> 47:16.034
And I just think about young me

47:16.034 --> 47:20.206
not being able
to talk to anybody.

47:20.206 --> 47:22.448
I'm so sorry.

47:22.448 --> 47:25.103
You never have to apologize
for emotion.

47:25.103 --> 47:27.413
It's just, like, I'm so used to

47:27.413 --> 47:30.103
not being able
to cry in front of people.

47:30.103 --> 47:32.206
I know that I got some shit
I'm dealing with,

47:32.206 --> 47:34.344
but I do think releasing it

47:34.344 --> 47:38.344
will open up
a more wider Kornbread,

47:38.344 --> 47:40.241
if it can get any wider
than what it is right now.

47:40.241 --> 47:42.034
This is the beginning
of the healing right here,

47:42.034 --> 47:44.448
and not shaming
the vulnerability.

47:44.448 --> 47:46.689
You did what you had to do
to get here.

47:46.689 --> 47:48.103
Now you're here.

47:48.103 --> 47:51.379
Now let the healing begin,
and let the water flow.

47:51.379 --> 47:52.482
-That's right.
-Let it flow.

47:54.793 --> 47:56.586
-Thank you, Kornbread.
-Thank you.

47:56.586 --> 47:58.517
Up next, Kerri Colby.

47:58.517 --> 48:00.275
Hello.

48:00.275 --> 48:01.793
This is, of course,
JLo's most infamous look,

48:01.793 --> 48:06.000
and to come out here and
pull it off as good as she did

48:06.000 --> 48:06.965
is quite a triumph.

48:06.965 --> 48:08.241
Thank you.

48:08.241 --> 48:09.965
Even JLo's looking at you
like, "Damn."

48:09.965 --> 48:11.931
A little birdie told me

48:11.931 --> 48:15.310
that you were saying that that
was the Jennifer's original.

48:15.310 --> 48:17.137
So, this is--yeah, it
actually is Jennifer's dress

48:17.137 --> 48:20.344
from her 2019 revival
with Versace.

48:20.344 --> 48:22.103
It looks so beautiful on you.

48:22.103 --> 48:23.965
I think for you, Kerri,

48:23.965 --> 48:26.275
you want to be beautiful
all the time.

48:26.275 --> 48:27.655
Yes.

48:27.655 --> 48:30.103
And I'm here to tell you
you are.

48:30.103 --> 48:33.206
So let's just throw that away.

48:33.206 --> 48:35.413
In the challenge, you know,

48:35.413 --> 48:37.103
I was trying to tell you,
just get ugly.

48:37.103 --> 48:41.241
If you let your guard down,
you're gonna go so much further

48:41.241 --> 48:43.413
not only in this competition,
but in life.

48:43.413 --> 48:45.310
I hear what Michelle's saying.

48:45.310 --> 48:47.758
When it's time to be funny
and be vulnerable,

48:47.758 --> 48:49.517
I can see a hesitation.

48:49.517 --> 48:51.344
It just kind of fell flat.

48:51.344 --> 48:53.103
-You have the story to tell.
-Yeah.

48:53.103 --> 48:54.586
Don't be afraid of the story.

48:54.586 --> 48:56.034
Allow us
to fall in love with you,

48:56.034 --> 48:59.068
because you'll find that
in that vulnerability,

48:59.068 --> 49:00.620
that's where the gold is.

49:00.620 --> 49:02.482
Thank you.

49:02.482 --> 49:04.862
Up next, DeJa Skye.

49:04.862 --> 49:07.793
Here's the deal with your
performance in the super tease.

49:07.793 --> 49:09.896
It was so good

49:09.896 --> 49:11.827
because you didn't push.

49:11.827 --> 49:13.862
It just felt natural.

49:13.862 --> 49:17.241
Your instincts as an actor
are just naturally believable,

49:17.241 --> 49:20.448
especially when you talk about
you didn't even learn to walk

49:20.448 --> 49:22.000
for the first two years
of your life.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.517
I couldn't even walk.

49:23.517 --> 49:25.689
You know, a lot of these
JLo interpretations

49:25.689 --> 49:27.000
are pretty dead-on.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.896
In fact, one of them
is the actual dress.

49:29.896 --> 49:31.758
Mm-hmm.

49:31.758 --> 49:34.965
This is a loose interpretation,
and I actually wanna call JLo

49:34.965 --> 49:36.344
and be, like, "You should
have done it like this."

49:36.344 --> 49:37.862
-Mm-hmm.
-Beautiful.

49:37.862 --> 49:40.344
And I don't have JLo's number.

49:41.448 --> 49:43.206
-Thank you, DeJa.
-Thank you.

49:43.206 --> 49:45.137
Angeria.

49:45.137 --> 49:47.413
Let me tell you something,
you ugly bitch.

49:50.758 --> 49:53.310
That's my favorite line
of the whole thing.

49:53.310 --> 49:55.137
Let me tell you something,
you ugly bitch.

49:55.137 --> 49:56.448
Do you know how hard it is

49:56.448 --> 49:59.068
to just swing that big
and hit like that?

49:59.068 --> 50:01.068
And it looked like
a natural thing for you.

50:01.068 --> 50:03.137
I believed every word you said.

50:03.137 --> 50:04.793
I felt like you forgot
the camera was there.

50:04.793 --> 50:07.172
When did you learn how to act?

50:07.172 --> 50:08.724
Uh, yesterday.

50:11.103 --> 50:15.379
And this JLo look,
sexy, it's her, it's beautiful.

50:15.379 --> 50:18.000
This look, gor-ge-ous.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.172
Up next, Alyssa Hunter.

50:21.172 --> 50:22.137
Hola, hola.

50:22.137 --> 50:23.413
I love this look.

50:23.413 --> 50:26.275
I loved it on JLo,
and I love it on you,

50:26.275 --> 50:29.034
because you have that moment,
that reveal, that pow.

50:29.034 --> 50:30.551
It just works onstage.

50:30.551 --> 50:33.655
In your performance,
what I loved about you, Alyssa,

50:33.655 --> 50:37.586
was you were ready to go for it,
and you wanted to work hard.

50:37.586 --> 50:38.827
But I think what happened was

50:38.827 --> 50:40.896
you got into
this high-pitched scream,

50:40.896 --> 50:43.172
very Yara Sofia,
if you know what I mean,

50:43.172 --> 50:44.448
and you got stuck there.

50:44.448 --> 50:47.517
!¡Ai, estúpida!

50:47.517 --> 50:50.689
So every response
was, "Ai-ai-ai,"

50:50.689 --> 50:53.448
instead of just really reacting.

50:53.448 --> 50:55.482
Don't go for the obvious
sometimes.

50:55.482 --> 50:58.689
Sometimes go for something
that's totally different,

50:58.689 --> 51:01.344
and you can even surprise
yourself as well as the judges.

51:01.344 --> 51:02.551
Thank you.

51:09.931 --> 51:11.724
There's so many emotions
right now.

51:11.724 --> 51:15.172
Since the beginning,
it was hard to be here,

51:15.172 --> 51:19.275
because English
is not my first language.

51:19.275 --> 51:22.551
And in an acting challenge,
I know that I can do it more.

51:22.551 --> 51:26.724
Yes, we can tell you try hard,
and you are fantastic.

51:26.724 --> 51:29.413
That's why I asked you here.

51:29.413 --> 51:33.137
But it's about all of these
different nuances

51:33.137 --> 51:34.724
and shades and colors.

51:34.724 --> 51:36.000
That's what we wanna see.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.827
And unfortunately,
we just saw one note.

51:38.827 --> 51:40.896
Thank you.

51:40.896 --> 51:42.931
All right.
Thank you, ladies.

51:42.931 --> 51:44.413
I think we've hard enough.

51:44.413 --> 51:46.655
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

51:46.655 --> 51:48.482
the judges and I
will deliberate.

51:49.793 --> 51:51.275
All right, just between
us squirrel friends,

51:51.275 --> 51:54.517
what do you think of our girls?

51:54.517 --> 51:56.655
Starting with Willow Pill.

51:56.655 --> 51:59.931
In the super tease,
y'all, she was so great.

51:59.931 --> 52:02.793
I absolutely
didn't see it coming.

52:02.793 --> 52:07.103
For her to bring back 1998
Jennifer Lopez, that's talent.

52:07.103 --> 52:09.758
I wrote down, "kind of ugly,"

52:09.758 --> 52:11.689
because that
was the best answer.

52:11.689 --> 52:14.724
This is a queen
who is very soulful.

52:14.724 --> 52:16.379
She could break the mold.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.344
You know, I just love
Kornbread so much.

52:20.344 --> 52:22.068
It's so good, it's delicious.

52:22.068 --> 52:24.034
You know, I like to pour some
butter and some syrup on mine.

52:24.034 --> 52:26.034
Jiffy cornbread.

52:26.034 --> 52:27.793
Well, I'm talking about
the queen.

52:27.793 --> 52:29.206
-Oh, Kornbread with a "K."
-Yeah.

52:29.206 --> 52:32.034
Kornbread is a powerhouse,
but she's gotta learn

52:32.034 --> 52:36.448
that there is so much power
in using different gears.

52:36.448 --> 52:38.517
Tonight, there was
a breakthrough,

52:38.517 --> 52:41.413
and I'm hoping that her
allowing herself to feel

52:41.413 --> 52:44.068
was the first step
of the rest of her life,

52:44.068 --> 52:45.379
and hopefully, you know,

52:45.379 --> 52:47.517
a longer time
in this competition,

52:47.517 --> 52:48.655
because she is really good.

52:48.655 --> 52:50.275
Kerri Colby.

52:50.275 --> 52:51.862
Two words: Gorg Orwell.

52:54.448 --> 52:56.172
That's it!

52:56.172 --> 52:57.241
You're so dumb.

52:57.241 --> 52:59.206
We know she's stunning,

52:59.206 --> 53:02.655
but the problem is
is that all she is?

53:02.655 --> 53:04.241
Talk about commitment.

53:04.241 --> 53:06.275
You know, all the other queens
did a JLo-inspired dress.

53:06.275 --> 53:07.896
That bitch wore JLo's dress!

53:07.896 --> 53:10.241
The fuck?

53:10.241 --> 53:13.896
She's gotta commit like that
to every challenge,

53:13.896 --> 53:16.206
and that is gonna take her
challenging herself.

53:16.206 --> 53:18.482
Mm-hmm. DeJa Skye.

53:18.482 --> 53:19.965
Her name may be DeJa Skye,

53:19.965 --> 53:21.724
but her head
is not in the clouds.

53:21.724 --> 53:25.482
You saw that she was able to use
different forms of comedy

53:25.482 --> 53:27.517
to where it wasn't one-note.

53:27.517 --> 53:31.482
On top of that,
she interpreted JLo's outfit,

53:31.482 --> 53:32.482
and made it work for her.

53:32.482 --> 53:34.586
Two words for DeJa tonight:

53:34.586 --> 53:36.241
Gorg Takei.

53:37.931 --> 53:39.241
Oh, my God.

53:39.241 --> 53:40.896
Angeria.

53:40.896 --> 53:42.448
I mean, she came here
to win this competition.

53:42.448 --> 53:44.310
She's letting
these bitches know,

53:44.310 --> 53:46.620
get yourself in order,

53:46.620 --> 53:48.827
'cause I'm not taking
no prisoners.

53:48.827 --> 53:52.172
She had no problem
getting ugly, getting dirty,

53:52.172 --> 53:54.551
and most importantly,
getting funny.

53:54.551 --> 53:57.724
And then to come out on
this runway and look like that?

53:57.724 --> 53:59.793
You wanna talk about
Gorg of the Jungle?

53:59.793 --> 54:00.931
-Honey!

54:00.931 --> 54:04.517
She's gonna get
Gorg R.R. Martin.

54:07.586 --> 54:09.000
Alyssa Hunter.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.931
I think Alyssa
fell into that trap

54:10.931 --> 54:13.586
that a lot of queens fall into

54:13.586 --> 54:16.551
where they go to their crutch,
and they do it at 100.

54:16.551 --> 54:18.103
So as an actor, you know,

54:18.103 --> 54:22.931
she's not George Clooney,
but she did look Gorg Looney.

54:24.344 --> 54:26.034
-You tried.
-I tried.

54:26.034 --> 54:28.689
When we need that trap door,
it's never here.

54:30.931 --> 54:33.655
Silence!
I've made my decision.

54:33.655 --> 54:36.551
Bring back my girls.

54:42.448 --> 54:44.862
Welcome back, ladies.

54:44.862 --> 54:46.551
I've made some decisions.

54:50.310 --> 54:51.379
DeJa Skye.

54:53.241 --> 54:54.655
You're safe.

54:54.655 --> 54:56.000
Thank you.

54:57.517 --> 54:58.724
You may join the other girls.

55:04.724 --> 55:05.965
Angeria.

55:05.965 --> 55:09.172
You put the super
in super tease.

55:10.655 --> 55:12.344
Con-drag-ulations.

55:12.344 --> 55:14.241
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

55:16.103 --> 55:19.827
You've won a cash prize
of $5,000.

55:19.827 --> 55:21.206
-Ooh!
-Ow!

55:21.206 --> 55:24.724
My non-acting ass just won
these people challenge.

55:24.724 --> 55:27.068
Whew, yes, I feel good.

55:32.413 --> 55:33.896
Willow Pill.

55:33.896 --> 55:35.689
You're safe.

55:35.689 --> 55:37.310
Thank you all so much.

55:37.310 --> 55:38.413
Thank you.

55:40.896 --> 55:42.103
Kornbread.

55:42.103 --> 55:45.275
The judges
want to see more range.

55:46.931 --> 55:48.655
Kerri Colby.

55:48.655 --> 55:51.655
The judges want to see
more vulnerability.

55:53.206 --> 55:54.482
Alyssa Hunter.

55:54.482 --> 55:58.586
The judges
want to see more versatility.

56:02.758 --> 56:05.413
Kornbread.

56:05.413 --> 56:06.896
You are safe.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.551
You may join the other girls.

56:14.827 --> 56:17.103
I'm gonna watch this.

56:18.482 --> 56:21.172
Kerri Colby, Alyssa Hunter,

56:21.172 --> 56:25.034
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

56:26.551 --> 56:28.724
I am definitely devastated.

56:28.724 --> 56:30.689
I'm also thinking
how in the hell

56:30.689 --> 56:32.517
am I gonna lip sync
in this dress?

56:32.517 --> 56:34.068
Because if I mess up this dress,

56:34.068 --> 56:36.000
I will literally--
y'all will lose me.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.965
I won't be found.
I'll be dead.

56:37.965 --> 56:40.620
Two queens stand before me.

56:42.103 --> 56:46.241
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

56:46.241 --> 56:49.931
and save yourself
from elimination.

56:52.310 --> 56:54.379
The time has come...

56:54.379 --> 56:56.827
for you to lip sync...

56:56.827 --> 57:00.137
for your life!

57:02.896 --> 57:04.275
This is not my moment
to go home.

57:04.275 --> 57:05.758
No, not yet.

57:05.758 --> 57:07.241
I'm gonna prove until the end

57:07.241 --> 57:10.275
that I deserve
to be in this competition.

57:11.655 --> 57:16.655
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

58:30.965 --> 58:32.896
Alyssa reaches
for her money gun

58:32.896 --> 58:36.206
and just, plblblblblt.

58:36.206 --> 58:38.620
That money gun seemed like
it's on lunch break, bitch,

58:38.620 --> 58:40.758
and it has not clocked back in.

58:45.827 --> 58:47.275
Yeah, that's the hotness
right there.

58:47.275 --> 58:48.275
Yeah!

58:57.620 --> 59:00.551
Just play my...song!

59:18.793 --> 59:21.862
Ladies, I've made my decision.

59:30.241 --> 59:32.931
Kerri Colby,
shantay you stay.

59:36.344 --> 59:37.862
You may join the other girls.

59:37.862 --> 59:39.103
Thank you so much.

59:39.103 --> 59:41.586
Thank you for letting me
play another day.

59:41.586 --> 59:44.379
Alyssa Hunter.

59:44.379 --> 59:51.793
Now your fate rests in the hands
of the drag gods.

59:51.793 --> 59:55.724
If you have the gold bar,
you will be saved.

59:57.275 --> 59:59.137
You've been hiding your candy.

59:59.137 --> 1:00:00.413
Now...

1:00:01.896 --> 1:00:03.862
Let's see what you got.

1:00:15.448 --> 1:00:18.862
It's just chocolate.

1:00:23.206 --> 1:00:26.586
Alyssa Hunter, in any language,

1:00:26.586 --> 1:00:28.965
you are a star, baby.

1:00:28.965 --> 1:00:30.068
Thank you very much.

1:00:30.068 --> 1:00:33.034
Now sashay away.

1:00:33.034 --> 1:00:34.724
I just wanna say thank you

1:00:34.724 --> 1:00:36.827
for giving me
this amazing opportunity.

1:00:36.827 --> 1:00:40.586
This experience transformed
my life into a whole new level,

1:00:40.586 --> 1:00:43.896
and I'm very grateful
from the bottom of my heart.

1:00:43.896 --> 1:00:45.448
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1:00:48.310 --> 1:00:49.965
We love you, Alyssa.

1:00:49.965 --> 1:00:52.241
Love you, girls.

1:00:52.241 --> 1:00:57.379
From Puerto Rico,
and now from the world.

1:00:57.379 --> 1:00:59.758
Love you!

1:01:02.103 --> 1:01:04.206
Hello.

1:01:04.206 --> 1:01:06.724
I'm feeling a little bit sad.

1:01:06.724 --> 1:01:09.758
But at the same time, I'm
feeling very proud of myself

1:01:09.758 --> 1:01:11.241
just to be here

1:01:11.241 --> 1:01:13.965
and represent all of my
beautiful Puerto Rican people.

1:01:13.965 --> 1:01:17.827
To all the Latin community,
thanks for all the support.

1:01:17.827 --> 1:01:21.172
Believe in yourself,
and be proud of who we are.

1:01:25.413 --> 1:01:28.068
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1:01:28.068 --> 1:01:31.137
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:01:31.137 --> 1:01:33.448
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:01:33.448 --> 1:01:35.034
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1:01:35.034 --> 1:01:36.551
-Amen!
-Amen!

1:01:36.551 --> 1:01:39.000
All right.
Now let the music play!

1:01:52.724 --> 1:01:54.310
Next time
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

1:01:54.310 --> 1:01:57.586
Please welcome Tempest DuJour,
Jaymes Mansfield,

1:01:57.586 --> 1:01:59.034
and Kahmora Hall.

1:01:59.034 --> 1:02:02.241
You need to create
a public service announcement

1:02:02.241 --> 1:02:05.655
for the Save a Queen
organization.

1:02:05.655 --> 1:02:08.310
You're gonna be late!
You're gonna be late!

1:02:08.310 --> 1:02:10.000
Aah!

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.482
The queens were challenged
to bring their best Gaga.

1:02:13.482 --> 1:02:16.000
It was so like The Count
from Sesame Street.

1:02:17.206 --> 1:02:18.448
Start packing now.

1:02:18.448 --> 1:02:21.862
This look is to die for.
I want it myself.

1:02:21.862 --> 1:02:23.551
It was so perfectly timed.

1:02:23.551 --> 1:02:26.034
Because of the way you talk,
there's no energy.

1:02:26.034 --> 1:02:27.931
If they want scary Kerri,

1:02:27.931 --> 1:02:30.344
they about to get
scary motherfucking Kerri.

1:02:30.344 --> 1:02:33.758
Aah!
