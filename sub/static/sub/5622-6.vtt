The Last Man On Earth.

00:02.837 --> 00:06.138

Knitters with Attitude.

<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.685 --> 00:20.285
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...
Did you ask the group

00:20.287 --> 00:21.286
<i>if they wanted some bacon?</i>

00:21.288 --> 00:22.554
Crickets are alive!

00:22.556 --> 00:24.823
TANDY:
<i>They're all eatin' bugs, man.</i>

00:24.825 --> 00:28.961
Why did I have to dress
the dummy in Gordon's clothes?

00:28.963 --> 00:30.629
(sobbing)

00:30.631 --> 00:32.464
I'm sick and tired of
you hitting on Carol!

00:32.466 --> 00:33.799
TANDY:
<i>All the evidence is gone.</i>

00:33.801 --> 00:35.334
Todd, do you have anything
you want to tell us?

00:35.336 --> 00:37.403
The fat guy ate
the bacon! (sobbing)

00:37.405 --> 00:38.670
(whispers):
Thanks, man.

00:38.672 --> 00:39.671
Fist bump?

00:39.673 --> 00:41.273
Bump.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.662
I'm trying to concentrate.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.498
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna try

02:12.500 --> 02:14.399
and fix your stuff
more quietly now.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.601
(laughs): Nice!

02:15.603 --> 02:17.469
Lifting the bricks
is the hardest part.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.071
MELISSA:
Yeah, I imagine your fingers

02:19.073 --> 02:20.472
must still be pretty slippery

02:20.474 --> 02:22.141
from all the friggin'
bacon grease.

02:22.143 --> 02:24.510
Aw, come on, Melissa,
how many times do I have to say

02:24.512 --> 02:25.911
I'm sorry?
TANDY: Wait,
you're sorry?

02:25.913 --> 02:27.513
That's funny,
I thought your name was Todd.

02:27.515 --> 02:28.680
Boom, still got it.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.083
(chuckles) So, uh, what's
going on out here, huh?

02:31.085 --> 02:33.652
Playing a little gold bar Jenga?
Little GBJ?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.521
You want to join us?
Well, I'd love to,

02:35.523 --> 02:37.789
but I got a little gas situation
on my hands. Hey, Phil,

02:37.791 --> 02:39.925
could you check
this out for me?

02:39.927 --> 02:41.460
You have knowledge
of this kind of bull-crap.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.628
Look at this.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.795
OTHERS:
Ew.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.931
Yep, it's gone bad.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.666
Gas goes bad?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.868
(chuckles):
I told you this a million times.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.436
Nobody remembers this?

02:51.438 --> 02:53.305
No, I remember, but, you know,
just for those

02:53.307 --> 02:54.773
who might not
have been paying attention

02:54.775 --> 02:55.941
at the time-- shame on you--

02:55.943 --> 02:57.676
you know, maybe run
over it one more time,

02:57.678 --> 02:59.344
just the ABCs of it?

02:59.346 --> 03:00.679
Unbelievable.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.015
Gas lasts about three years.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.349
Three years.
Yep, I remember that.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.185
Diesel lasts a year or two
longer than gas.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.719
One or two... more. yeah.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.555
And then there's jet fuel...
Fuels jets.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.856
...which lasts longer
than diesel

03:10.858 --> 03:12.658
but still has
an expiration date.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.126
Date when it expires.

03:14.128 --> 03:16.895
None of these are
long-term solutions.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.497
Nobody remembers this?

03:18.499 --> 03:20.699
Well, you know what?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.367
I'm glad this is happening.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.002
Because now you finally realize

03:24.004 --> 03:26.538
that Malibu is
the worst place we could be.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.074
Shut your ever-loving tongue!
(others speaking angrily)

03:29.076 --> 03:30.509
Phil, you are such a crank!

03:30.511 --> 03:32.044
Why can't you appreciate
where you are

03:32.046 --> 03:34.346
for once?
You know what I appreciate?

03:34.348 --> 03:36.381
Food. And fresh water.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.383
And there's very
little of that here.
And now that the gas

03:38.385 --> 03:41.753
has gone bad, it's gonna be very
tough to find fresh supplies.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.755
All right,
so what do you suggest, Phil?

03:43.757 --> 03:46.892
We need to go
to a more livable place, guys.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.561
We are not moving.
We love Malibu.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.364
Look, guys, there comes a point
where we need to decide

03:52.366 --> 03:54.166
whether we continue
to live for today,

03:54.168 --> 03:55.934
or actually plan for tomorrow.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.502
You know, Phil might be right.

03:57.504 --> 04:00.772
Malibu's good for now, but what
about when we start having kids?

04:00.774 --> 04:03.175
Well, let's just
not have kids, then.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.178
ERICA:
Yeah, I'm good with that.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.580
Okay, so it's decided--
no kids,

04:08.582 --> 04:10.515
we're gonna live for the now,

04:10.517 --> 04:12.351
and the now
starts now.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.720
(chanting quietly):
YOLO. YOLO.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.622
(growing louder):
YOLO. YOLO.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.390
YOLO! YOLO!

04:18.392 --> 04:21.793
YOLO! YOLO! YOLO! YOLO! YOLO!

04:21.795 --> 04:23.595
(groans)

04:23.597 --> 04:26.765
You know, I'm-I'm really tired
of doing all the work out here.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.801
Maybe<i> I</i> should get
a breather, huh?

04:29.803 --> 04:32.604
Have myself a little YOLO time.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.606
That's what I'm gonna do.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.942
Yeah. Here's the tool belt.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.444
You'll be just fine
without me.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.713
ERICA:
Yep.
All right, good luck.

04:44.150 --> 04:47.352
I thought he was
gonna take his pants off.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.156
I am so thrown
for a loop.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.457
I thought
everyone wanted

04:52.459 --> 04:53.792
to have babies.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.794
Hey, don't worry, Care Bear.
They'll come around.

04:55.796 --> 04:56.962
I don't know.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.330
You heard Phil.

04:58.332 --> 05:02.134
Nobody wants to raise a baby
in the wastelands of Malibu.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.936
Maybe we<i> should</i> move.
Hey, what if

05:04.938 --> 05:07.139
I was to whip this place
into shape?

05:07.141 --> 05:08.607
How you gonna do that?

05:08.609 --> 05:10.142
Phil's not the only one
around here

05:10.144 --> 05:11.777
with skills to pay the bills.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.479
You gonna pay the bills
with your skill set?

05:14.481 --> 05:15.814
I'm gonna try.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.582
I think that's a
great idea, Phil.

05:17.584 --> 05:20.085
You know, it could gain
some points with the group.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.421
I'm not trying to gain points--
that sounds gross.

05:22.423 --> 05:25.123
I'm trying to<i> earn</i> points.
There's a big difference.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.591
Well,<i> I</i> can see
the difference.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.960
And I think soon the
others will, too.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.929
I mean, Todd
already has, huh?

05:30.931 --> 05:32.364
Yeah.

05:32.366 --> 05:36.068
It's so nice to see the two
of you fisting each other again.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.704
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.038
You keep this up,

05:40.040 --> 05:42.908
pretty soon you'll be fisting
the whole community.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.678
Hope to.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.515
Hey, buddy.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.616
What's all this?

05:51.618 --> 05:53.352
Ah. Well, you know,

05:53.354 --> 05:55.887
since it seems like we're
committing to Malibu here,

05:55.889 --> 05:58.657
and Phil's out on strike,
thought I'd take it upon myself

05:58.659 --> 06:00.659
to give her
a little makeover.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.027
Solar panels, huh?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.529
Yeah, let's get a little power
in this tower, huh?

06:04.531 --> 06:05.831
(chuckles):
Yeah.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.632
Little wattage in this cottage.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.167
Little sizzle in the hizzle.

06:09.169 --> 06:12.003
(chuckles):
Love it.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.139
Ah. Well, you need a hand?

06:14.141 --> 06:15.907
No, got two already,
but I'd love some company.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.509
Well, then you got
some company.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.544
You're not just company, bud,
you're a whole corporation.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.313
That's not a weight crack,
by they way,

06:21.315 --> 06:23.382
that's speaking of the size
of your friendship.
Well,

06:23.384 --> 06:26.318
you're a corporation, too, and
I<i> am</i> talking about your weight.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.086
Ha! It's good to have you back.
I've missed this.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.488
I have, too.
Yeah.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.556
So, uh, you know how
to install these things?

06:31.558 --> 06:34.226
Well, you know, I watched Phil
put 'em up in Tucson,

06:34.228 --> 06:36.595
and I got the general gist--
you know, you just

06:36.597 --> 06:38.730
throw these suckers out
where the sun hits 'em,

06:38.732 --> 06:41.733
and that's gonna send
a little juice into
that wire and, uh,

06:41.735 --> 06:44.936
plug that into something,
and then, zap, electricity.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.705
Well, good, good.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.507
That's great.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.275
Something on your mind, bud?

06:50.277 --> 06:51.843
Yeah, I'm-I'm a little bummed

06:51.845 --> 06:53.245
about Melissa not wanting
to have babies.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.514
You know, I thought
we were on the same page there.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.015
I think
she's still a little upset

06:57.017 --> 06:59.351
about the whole bacon thing.
Then you know what?

06:59.353 --> 07:02.087
Why don't you jump in here?
A little community consciousness

07:02.089 --> 07:04.089
could just change
your fortunes, huh?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.524
Women love a doer.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.192
Thanks, man.
Hey, you see
something over there

07:07.194 --> 07:09.060
that looks like something
that wire would plug into?

07:09.062 --> 07:11.730
I don't. I think
just this...

07:11.732 --> 07:13.532
empty cardboard box.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.434
(chuckles): Yeah.
Well, I don't think<i> that's</i> it.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.535
(laughs):
No.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.971
Does it have, like,
a little plug-sized hole

07:19.973 --> 07:23.308
or anything?
No. I-I think it's just the
box that the panels came in.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.976
Yeah, that's
what I thought. Yeah.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.979
Oh, look, says here
you got to plug it
into a junction box.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.548
Oh, do we have a junction box?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.817
I don't know
what that is.
Huh.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.953
And we're sure
it's not that cardboard box?

07:35.988 --> 07:37.255
I-I don't think so.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.458
(chuckles):
Yeah. I don't, either.
(laughs)

07:39.460 --> 07:42.994
Well, maybe we should
pick one of those up, huh?

07:42.996 --> 07:44.629
Yeah. That's a pretty good call.
Yeah?

07:44.631 --> 07:46.331
Want to go get some food first?

07:46.333 --> 07:48.333
I could eat.
Okay, great.
Well, then food,

07:48.335 --> 07:50.769
junction box store,
then we light this mother up.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.103
Bam. Ha-ha!

07:52.105 --> 07:53.772
(slaps Todd's behind)
Whoa!

07:53.774 --> 07:55.607
Got me.
Got to stay on your toes.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.842
TODD:
I certainly do.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.310
(low crackling)

08:03.649 --> 08:05.750
Yeah, should be
a pretty open-and-shut case

08:05.752 --> 08:07.752
once we get down to beeswax.

08:07.754 --> 08:10.422
Couple of men stretching
their wings out under the sun.

08:10.424 --> 08:11.490
(chuckles):
Yeah.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.592
We're gonna have it done
by nap time.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.093
(electrical crackling)

08:15.095 --> 08:17.028
Uh, Tandy?

08:17.030 --> 08:19.598
I-I think we got a problem.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.603
Well, this is

08:24.605 --> 08:26.438
a shocking turn of events.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.373
Boom, I still got it.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.041
TODD:
That looks kind of dangerous.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.177
It's definitely
in the dangerous family.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.945
Let's give her a poke.

08:34.881 --> 08:37.616
Careful.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.484
Careful's my middle name, bro.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.186
Just kidding. It's Tandy.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.121
(electrical crackling)

08:43.123 --> 08:46.024
Yeah, that's all
in the family.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.459
TODD:
At least it's not stuck anymore.

08:47.461 --> 08:50.061
At least
it's not stuck anymore.
Yeah.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.530
Knock, knock.

08:52.798 --> 08:54.399
Hey, Carol.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.801
I've just been thinking
about what you said

08:56.803 --> 08:59.638
regarding not wanting a baby,
and I have to admit,

08:59.640 --> 09:01.306
I was a little thrown.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.241
I'm sorry.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.310
Well, not as sorry
as you're gonna be

09:05.312 --> 09:08.079
if you never meet
this little guy.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.317
Whoa. What-what is that?

09:12.319 --> 09:15.520
This... is everything

09:15.522 --> 09:18.723
of which you never knew
you ever dreamed.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.860
This is what you and Todd's
baby would look like.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.562
(high-pitched, gruff):
Mama.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.363
Kind of puts

09:25.365 --> 09:27.165
a little different spin
on things, doesn't it?

09:27.167 --> 09:28.333
Mm, yeah.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.701
That's a real game-changer.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.169
I knew you would think so.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.772
That's the spirit.
We can do it together.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.440
No, I'm not bringing
a baby into this world.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.942
There are no doctors.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.244
We're running out
of food, and...

09:39.246 --> 09:41.613
there are whale
carcasses everywhere.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.515
So you want my baby
to die alone?

09:43.517 --> 09:44.749
'Cause that's what's
gonna happen.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.885
We're all gonna die,
and he's gonna be

09:46.887 --> 09:49.721
75 and all alone because of you.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.190
It's a no.
No?

09:52.192 --> 09:55.627
Look that baby in the eyes
and tell it no.

09:55.629 --> 09:59.731
(high-pitched, gruff):
Mama, I want to exist.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.366
Carol, it's a no.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.034
Okay.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.470
Okay.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.806
(high-pitched, gruff):
Big mistake.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.709
(electrical crackling)

10:10.711 --> 10:12.777
All right, Todd,
it's safe.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.813
Now we just have to figure out

10:14.815 --> 10:17.082
a way to get her in
that junction box.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.316
Yeah, maybe we
should go get Phil.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.618
I bet he'd know
what to do.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.919
We can't get Phil. Okay?

10:20.921 --> 10:22.887
We have a chance here
to really prove ourselves

10:22.889 --> 10:25.423
to the community,
earn a little respect.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.993
I want to do this for them.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.728
Fine, okay.
What do we do?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.162
(sighs heavily)

10:31.164 --> 10:33.164
I don't know.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.735
Just got to figure out a way
to cut off her food supply.

10:37.937 --> 10:41.373
I think I have
just the idea.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.609
CAROL:
Hey, girl.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.977
(laughs):
Wow!

10:45.979 --> 10:47.579
Melissa!

10:47.581 --> 10:48.980
Am I right?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.582
What about Melissa?

10:50.584 --> 10:52.651
"What about Melissa?"

10:52.653 --> 10:55.353
Come on, she's being
as stubborn as a mule

10:55.355 --> 10:57.856
who refuses to reproduce.

10:57.858 --> 11:01.359
Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to
side with Melissa on this one.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.129
My sister had kids, and it
turned her nether regions

11:04.131 --> 11:06.498
into a real war zone.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.700
Her boobs were
like coin purses.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.969
Well, who doesn't love
a good coin purse?

11:10.971 --> 11:13.538
Put it in your hand
and feel all those coins?

11:13.540 --> 11:15.507
Just feel richer and richer

11:15.509 --> 11:17.542
the more you squeeze?
No.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.611
I'm not gonna
have kids, Carol.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.681
No.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.783
Chuck me another
duvet.
Here.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.955
Easy, buddy.

11:30.957 --> 11:33.191
She's dancing, man.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.326
Spitting fire.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.328
You working with me or
against me, you freaking tape?

11:37.330 --> 11:39.064
She is super pissed.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.299
Quick, Tan.
In and out, man.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.701
You got it.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.335
I'm out of tape!

11:44.337 --> 11:46.004
Oh, I'm not! Okay.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.806
Ah, the tape receded!

11:47.808 --> 11:50.241
Okay, you got it?
Got it.
I got it.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.643
Come on, that's it.

11:51.645 --> 11:52.644
It is complete.

11:52.646 --> 11:53.845
Just-just
straight back, Tan.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.714
Come to my voice.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.749
You're home, bud.

11:57.751 --> 12:01.653
Now we wait for her
to die of starvation.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.922
Sweet dreams, my lady.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.124
See you in hell.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.595
GAIL:
Oh, Gordon, you're so handsome.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.267
And your hair's
looking good.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.671
(door opens)
CAROL:
Gail? Yoo-hoo!

12:19.673 --> 12:20.839
I just thought I could...

12:20.841 --> 12:23.441
Geez. Geez, Carol, knock!

12:23.443 --> 12:25.276
I'm so sorry.
(sighs)
Oh.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.512
Were you masturbating?

12:29.248 --> 12:30.348
Yes.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.117
I was masturbating.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.119
Well, just curious.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.722
Would you have been masturbating
to the idea of having a baby?

12:37.724 --> 12:40.091
No, Carol. That
ship has sailed.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.127
Okay.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.062
Worth a try.
Yeah.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.296
Yeah.
Okay.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.531
Okay.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.800
Maybe knock next time, Carol.

12:48.802 --> 12:49.968
Well, I just didn't know

12:49.970 --> 12:51.936
you were masturbating
in here all the time.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.938
Well, now you know.
Okay.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.007
Mm.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.044
Are you sure
that's all the duvets?

13:00.046 --> 13:01.646
That's all of
'em, Tandy.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.115
The sun's still sneaking in
there somehow. I don't get it.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.650
You know, it's-it's like
it's gotten worse

13:05.652 --> 13:07.085
since we put
the duvets on.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.387
Should we take the duvets off
and see if she calms down?

13:09.389 --> 13:11.456
Ah, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.458
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.660
(sighs)
Okay, we're done.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.395
What?
We're done.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.663
No way!
Look...

13:18.665 --> 13:20.265
What are you gonna do, man?

13:20.267 --> 13:21.666
You know, I
wanted to do this

13:21.668 --> 13:24.169
so I could show the community
how much I care about them.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.304
But I... you know, if
I really care about them,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.173
I got to do the
right thing here.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.175
All right,
wish me luck.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.677
Godspeed, bro.

13:36.015 --> 13:38.416
(electrical crackling)

13:50.696 --> 13:53.131
Sorry to interrupt, but

13:53.133 --> 13:54.999
I really need your help.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.435
We got a rogue wire
on our hands.

13:59.371 --> 14:03.208
Look, this isn't the easiest
thing in the world for me, okay?

14:03.210 --> 14:05.710
You're the last person I want
to come groveling to for help.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.046
But I'm trying to do
what's best for the group here.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.881
I'm busy.

14:09.883 --> 14:12.450
Please. It's getting
really dangerous.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.553
Well, you're on your own.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.690
Can we not let this be
about our stuff right now?

14:20.860 --> 14:24.162
And what<i> stuff</i>
would that be, huh?

14:24.164 --> 14:26.898
Oh, come on. You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.833
I mean, how long is it gonna
take you to get over all this?

14:28.835 --> 14:31.069
Over what?
Carol.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.370
Don't go there, Tandy.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.572
I-I don't get why she
chose me over you, either.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.841
Okay, you're clearly
the better choice.

14:36.843 --> 14:39.210
But one of these days, you're
gonna have to wrap your head

14:39.212 --> 14:41.479
around it, 'cause
I'm not going away!

14:41.481 --> 14:44.382
Okay, so, I'm sorry,
but she chose me.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.018
Come again?
Carol... chose... me.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.920
(grunts)
(others exclaiming)

14:53.893 --> 14:55.493
Phil, knock it off, man!
Phil, come on!

14:55.495 --> 14:56.928
Hey, stop it!

14:56.930 --> 14:58.596
Not cool, man!

14:58.598 --> 15:00.431
Tandy, are you okay?
I'm fine.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.933
What'd you do that for?

15:01.935 --> 15:03.101
What, are you a big man now?
Huh?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.269
MELISSA: Yeah, pick on
someone your own size.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.770
This is like hitting a girl!

15:05.772 --> 15:07.538
I don't know about that.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.974
What do you have to
say for yourself, Phil?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.444
Where are you going?

15:13.446 --> 15:16.180
What are you doing?

15:16.182 --> 15:17.949
Hey!

15:17.951 --> 15:18.950
Hey!
Hey!

15:18.952 --> 15:19.951
Phil!
Phil!

15:19.953 --> 15:21.286
(knocking)

15:21.288 --> 15:22.954
Oh.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.623
ERICA:
What do you have to
say for yourself?

15:25.625 --> 15:27.292
Okay, then I'll start.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.761
That was wrong, Phil.
You could have really hurt him.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.397
Yeah, you can't do that, man.
He was just standing there.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.399
Yeah, we all know
Tandy's a tool,

15:34.401 --> 15:37.368
but you can't just punch up
on someone's face for that.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.904
Yeah, being a tool is annoying,
but it's not a crime.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.906
Okay, thank you
for the support, guys.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.142
I, uh, disagree
with the tool stuff, but, uh,

15:44.144 --> 15:46.077
you know, appreciate
the... the sentiment.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.912
But, look, I provoked him, okay?

15:47.914 --> 15:50.648
I-I didn't mean to,
but I did it, okay?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.216
You shouldn't have punched me,

15:52.218 --> 15:53.885
but, you know,
let's just

15:53.887 --> 15:55.887
move on from this, okay?
GAIL: No!

15:55.889 --> 15:57.088
You need to
be punished!

15:57.090 --> 15:58.423
You do the crime,
you do the time.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.824
Do you remember that, Phil?

15:59.826 --> 16:02.226
I think we ought to make him
touch that wire.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.761
No, we have a system
of punishment

16:03.763 --> 16:04.963
that works-- the stocks!

16:04.965 --> 16:07.131
Tandy did it, I did it,
and it works!

16:07.133 --> 16:08.733
Now it's Phil's turn!

16:08.735 --> 16:09.734
CAROL:
Well, how many days

16:09.736 --> 16:11.169
for a person
punching someone?

16:11.171 --> 16:12.670
We got a day for bacon.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.172
This is much worse than bacon.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.907
This is assault.

16:15.909 --> 16:17.075
So, what, two days?

16:17.077 --> 16:18.309
That sounds good.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.944
Yeah, all right,
so two days it is.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.512
Off to the stocks, Phil.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.414
No.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.016
Yeah-huh.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.751
Nope.
TANDY:
Okay, Phil, look,

16:26.753 --> 16:29.687
it-it seems like a fair
punishment, okay?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.622
I mean, the-the
group has spoken,

16:31.624 --> 16:33.524
and-and we're not gonna
negotiate with you

16:33.526 --> 16:35.193
on this, okay?

16:35.195 --> 16:39.163
You know, C to the T,
and... and, uh... such.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.201
Okay, tell you what.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.936
We'll negotiate with you
a little on this one,

16:44.938 --> 16:46.270
but, like, just one
back and forth,

16:46.272 --> 16:48.373
and then you got to do
whatever we land on.

16:48.375 --> 16:52.210
Okay? So, uh, punishment-wise,
wh-what you thinking?

16:52.212 --> 16:55.113
(chuckles)

16:55.115 --> 16:56.781
None.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.283
Okay, okay, I hear you.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.619
But here's what
I'm coming back with.

17:01.621 --> 17:02.920
Some punishment.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.291
After everything
I've done for you guys?

17:07.293 --> 17:09.994
Look at how crappy
this place got in the one day

17:09.996 --> 17:11.896
that I haven't been
fixing things for you.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.298
You can now get electrocuted
in your very own home.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.500
Good job.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.568
No.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.904
I don't feel bad
I punched Tandy.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.906
I shouldn't be punished
for something

17:21.908 --> 17:24.542
I should have done
a long time ago.

17:25.511 --> 17:27.345
Oh... hey!
Well... hey!

17:27.347 --> 17:29.814
You can't just walk away!
Come back here!

17:29.816 --> 17:31.716
This is a society!

17:31.718 --> 17:33.785
Ridiculous!

17:34.853 --> 17:36.654
God.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.123
Still want
to have kids?

17:42.861 --> 17:44.996
(smacks lips)

17:46.065 --> 17:47.565
(sighs)

18:07.686 --> 18:09.654
(electrical crackling)

18:11.590 --> 18:13.291
Did you try
covering the panels?

18:13.293 --> 18:14.459
What do we look like?

18:14.461 --> 18:16.627
People who wouldn't try
covering the panels?

18:16.629 --> 18:17.862
Duvets.
We tried duvets.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.297
We tried duvets.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.133
GAIL: And the wire's supposed
to go in one of those things?

18:22.135 --> 18:24.635
It's called a junction
box, Gail. (scoffs)

18:24.637 --> 18:26.370
(Phil 2 clears his throat,
Erica gasps)

18:26.372 --> 18:28.873
Phil.
He's out.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.542
(electrical crackling)

18:35.914 --> 18:38.116
What's he doing?
What's he gonna do,
punch it?

18:46.992 --> 18:48.993
On-off switch.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.462
Shut the front door.
There's a...?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.264
Look, I came out here 'cause
I wanted to say something.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.932
(whispers): He's hopping
in the stocks. Watch.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.068
I thought long and hard
about what happened yesterday,

18:57.070 --> 18:58.636
and I finally came to my senses.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.471
I knew it.

19:00.473 --> 19:04.108
I'm leaving Malibu.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.177
For good.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.519
I knew it.
Leaving Malibu.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.487
Said it, called it
right here. Yeah, yeah.

19:21.093 --> 19:22.994
I can't believe he's actually
leaving. I mean, he's just

19:22.996 --> 19:24.495
doing it. He said
he was gonna do it.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.430
Now he's in the process
of actually doing it.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.166
He's just, like,
loading up his car,

19:28.168 --> 19:30.001
putting all his stuff in there.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.036
He's gonna do it.
He's just doing it.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.638
GAIL:
We're better off without him.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.273
And I won't miss him

19:35.275 --> 19:38.476
throwing it in our face, all
the stuff he's been fixin'.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.178
What a martyr.
I know.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.779
Yeah, I hate people like that.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.447
It's like,
we get it, you know?

19:43.449 --> 19:44.849
We get it.
We understand.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.918
Uh, who does that?

19:57.196 --> 20:00.231
Before I leave,
I have one last thing to say.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.769
I need to apologize to somebody
who's very special to me.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.640
Carol, I know
my actions have upset you.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.244
And you deserve
happiness.

20:13.246 --> 20:16.214
And for the longest time, I've
stood in the way of that, so...

20:16.216 --> 20:19.550
I just want you to know,
I never meant to hurt you.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.319
I just don't understand.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.588
How could you be with Tandy?

20:24.756 --> 20:26.991
He's a dolt.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.993
He's dumber than
a bag of hair.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.095
He held us all up
at gunpoint, Carol.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.563
He threatened
to kill me.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.233
He-he tried to cheat
on you, and he poops

20:35.235 --> 20:38.569
in the ocean, right
in front of our beach

20:38.571 --> 20:40.071
every damn day!

20:40.073 --> 20:42.607
What is that?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.609
Carol...

20:44.611 --> 20:46.644
(laughs):
you're with the wrong guy.

20:48.413 --> 20:51.749
But it's not too late
to change that.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.085
As I learned
from all of you, YOLO.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.354
You only live once.

20:56.356 --> 21:00.224
And I want my once
to be with you.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.293
Carol, I love you.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.997
Will you come with me?

21:08.433 --> 21:10.768
ERICA:
I'm pregnant, Phil.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.839
I'm pregnant.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.277
CHILDREN:
<i>Uncle Stinky.</i>

21:53.279 --> 21:54.679
(horn honking)
