01:34.997 --> 01:38.126
How would you describe the morale of a squad?

01:40.336 --> 01:43.505
I'm sorry. I am asking the wrong question.

01:43.506 --> 01:45.566
Repacemos.

01:46.742 --> 01:50.007
At the beginning of an operation morale was high ...

01:54.416 --> 01:57.409
Yes. Had good morals as a unit,

01:57.887 --> 02:01.517
had good ties as a team, but

02:03.927 --> 02:05.519
said ...

02:14.970 --> 02:17.472
When did you notice something was wrong?

02:17.507 --> 02:19.091
Wrong with what?

02:29.587 --> 02:32.488
We must be calm. We make the effort, but the same happens.

02:32.990 --> 02:35.837
Then I return to my question, how does that affect your man?

02:35.872 --> 02:38.251
Soldiers complain. It's what they do.

02:40.301 --> 02:42.908
To be honest, our team sucks.

02:47.171 --> 02:49.036
Yeah yeah. Complain.

02:49.340 --> 02:51.137

03:50.075 --> 03:51.322
All right, people.

03:53.099 --> 03:54.164

03:58.717 --> 04:00.605
Thank you. Stink.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.458
Needless to say it.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.740
We will establish a PC here. (Checkpoint)

04:04.775 --> 04:08.496
Looking towards the village, and with open eyes. OK?

04:09.122 --> 04:10.122
Well.

04:11.261 --> 04:12.431
Very clever.

04:12.466 --> 04:14.431
You are going to stink for a while more.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.341
Rests friend.

04:20.366 --> 04:22.108
You'll be up all night.

04:35.687 --> 04:36.991
Hey, Ginge.

04:38.052 --> 04:40.635
And what happened to the pool and jacuzzi?

04:41.115 --> 04:42.661
Would you like a massage?

04:44.058 --> 04:47.550
Let Ginge. Only the dream alive.

04:50.597 --> 04:53.327
Only the dream alive.

05:13.221 --> 05:14.414
Chucha!

05:14.689 --> 05:16.486
I told you you could not do it.

05:18.494 --> 05:20.325
That scrap of shit.

05:21.396 --> 05:23.489
Would you can lend a hand?

05:25.634 --> 05:29.194
No. I'm smoking. So do what you can.

05:34.109 --> 05:35.109
Pásamela.

05:35.968 --> 05:37.422
- You got it? - Yes.

05:39.447 --> 05:42.951
We're going to throw it anyway.

05:42.952 --> 05:45.519
It's just a fucking gun.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.172
Better not ask questions like that,

05:48.207 --> 05:49.393
if you'll ask me.

05:49.428 --> 05:52.226
Yes.

05:52.528 --> 05:53.995
You are pure do or die.

05:54.498 --> 05:56.864
Do and die. You have no choice. See?

05:59.103 --> 06:01.125
You'll need fat for that.

06:42.062 --> 06:43.062
Stab.

06:43.087 --> 06:44.986
What the fuck are you playing?

06:47.185 --> 06:50.654
I thought you played the first turn.

06:50.655 --> 06:51.815
Did not he?

06:54.158 --> 06:56.032
When you say, I have prepared my shot.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.318
Not for long.

06:57.498 --> 06:58.498
It's not my fault.

06:58.522 --> 06:59.775
You said it was a bad boy.

06:59.810 --> 07:00.636
Did I say something, Stab?

07:00.671 --> 07:02.673
Hand me that bag and you can stay with my supplies.

07:02.708 --> 07:03.762
Do not listen Stab.

07:03.797 --> 07:06.381
It is Welsh. I grew up raised by animals fucking.

07:06.416 --> 07:09.267
In the most beautiful girls in the world loves animals.

07:09.302 --> 07:11.025
Your still a good for nothing Londoner.

07:11.060 --> 07:14.787
You ask a Welshman a fungus becomes full of cow poop.

07:14.822 --> 07:15.725
Cut it now.

07:15.760 --> 07:16.990
Sumdge,

07:17.025 --> 07:18.882
Stagler says you go first.

07:18.917 --> 07:23.201
You open the PO and check vehicles every hour.

07:24.133 --> 07:25.276
Y Sumdge...

07:26.519 --> 07:29.411
No eres Rambo. Consíguete a tripod.

08:30.738 --> 08:31.738

08:31.762 --> 08:33.215
Not one of us!

08:33.250 --> 08:35.383
Damn! We have contact!

08:36.837 --> 08:39.235
Come on, Sergeant. Do not miss the party.

08:39.547 --> 08:40.577

They're on the air!

09:03.656 --> 09:06.379
Is anyone else organizing their air.

09:06.414 --> 09:08.426
The Americans, Sergeant?

09:08.701 --> 09:11.002
Do exercises in those hills.

09:15.066 --> 09:17.520
Silicon One Zero, change.

09:25.387 --> 09:27.375
Zero copied out.

09:27.979 --> 09:30.707
It is a Special Forces operation.

09:32.327 --> 09:34.286
He said he knew it was not necessary,

09:34.321 --> 09:37.784
al verlos would give us advanced warning.

09:37.819 --> 09:39.983
Kill the capture.

09:40.865 --> 09:42.480
Son of a bitch!

09:42.515 --> 09:44.024
What did you say?

09:45.141 --> 09:46.471
Nothing, boss.

09:46.709 --> 09:48.923
He said it would be good for the next ...

09:48.958 --> 09:51.137
warn us that we would receive the visit of OE

09:52.247 --> 09:54.642
Les we would have invited a cup of tea.

09:58.775 --> 10:01.855
Everyone to bed.

10:01.890 --> 10:04.625
Tomorrow we will begin a long journey.

10:06.025 --> 10:09.123
You heard the man. A bed, ladies.

10:49.076 --> 10:50.808
Someone will pay for this.

10:51.530 --> 10:53.012
What do you mean?

10:54.368 --> 10:56.800
It is good that the SAS Scout den,

10:56.835 --> 10:58.850
but they'll go in the morning.

11:00.924 --> 11:02.477
I do not understand.

11:02.512 --> 11:05.939
Bitch, Stab! Afghans are going to be pissed ...

11:05.974 --> 11:07.370
the problems of the SAS

11:07.405 --> 11:10.217
And they will find someone who hanging.

11:10.252 --> 11:16.147
How do you know they were from the SAS? They might be Americans.

11:16.720 --> 11:21.298
In sum I think, sergeant. Ellos believe that we are all Russians.

11:59.893 --> 12:00.945
I care ...

12:02.972 --> 12:04.193
Thanks, man.

12:07.657 --> 12:09.189
Keep working.

12:21.593 --> 12:23.619
Well, folks. Come over here.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.100
Is it heavy?

12:34.129 --> 12:35.129
Sumdge.

12:36.834 --> 12:37.834
Well.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.523
There was a change of plans.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.565
We're going to stay a while longer.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.595
They had a contact this morning to 3 clicks and it seems

12:44.630 --> 12:47.326
Terry is mounting a counterattack.

12:47.361 --> 12:49.628
So, let's keep the line

12:49.663 --> 12:51.575
and we will call in air support.

12:51.610 --> 12:54.707
See if we can control the situation. OK?

12:55.197 --> 12:56.197
Well.

12:58.244 --> 12:59.244
Dismissed.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.539
And me thinking that cold shower.

13:04.574 --> 13:07.350
I can walk but I can always smelly bath.

13:07.385 --> 13:09.555
However, you will always be Welsh.

14:13.527 --> 14:15.245
They should do like 50 º C heat.

14:19.558 --> 14:20.979
And why stop now?

14:22.517 --> 14:24.470
Because I'm the hot shit.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.100
We stopped us.

14:26.301 --> 14:28.149
Do not shoot unless you tell them.

14:30.806 --> 14:32.812
What is this type of contradefensa.

14:32.847 --> 14:34.629
Three patrol days online.

14:34.664 --> 14:36.590
That sucks offensive.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.516
Good. I'm going with the union.

14:38.551 --> 14:39.945
Bird coming!

14:39.980 --> 14:41.305
Let me Fuck.

14:41.340 --> 14:44.234
Lieutenant waste much time on the phone ...

14:45.606 --> 14:49.198
- No I see a while. - Yes. That's why it is hiding.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.773
That will be all. Right, boss?

14:56.808 --> 14:58.755
Hopefully if.

14:59.118 --> 15:00.311
¡Muévanse!

15:14.738 --> 15:16.691
What do you do with us, Ginge?

15:17.240 --> 15:19.494
Can not go with your major?

15:19.934 --> 15:22.703
You lose sleep. Iraq.

15:22.877 --> 15:24.946
They said if I did not get a PVR ...

15:24.981 --> 15:25.724
Naaa ...

15:25.759 --> 15:28.096
Best for the army anyway.

15:28.131 --> 15:31.764
You would like a dress and caparían anytime.

15:32.491 --> 15:35.183
Just say, Ginge. Great gay.

15:36.815 --> 15:39.036
You're only gay if you push back.

15:43.088 --> 15:44.526
El pobre Ginge,...

15:44.561 --> 15:46.834
Been a long time for men.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.511
Stab.

15:55.306 --> 15:57.454
This is a great piece of shit.

15:57.489 --> 16:00.634
Soldier Smith. Please, could you stop complaining team?

16:01.424 --> 16:02.424
Yes, sir.

16:03.253 --> 16:05.783
It's just a shame that the SAS do not do well.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.711
And my name is Smudge, sir.

16:19.942 --> 16:22.740
In fact I would like you calling me by my real name.

16:25.001 --> 16:27.271
Of course not.

16:27.306 --> 16:29.541
Soy Smith, y no Smudge.

16:29.576 --> 16:31.210
Taff es galés.

16:31.245 --> 16:33.512
The sergeant is Sol Campbell.

16:33.547 --> 16:34.452
Thus we see.

16:34.487 --> 16:35.323
Y Ginge...

16:35.358 --> 16:38.962
Ginge has the worst name in the history of mankind.

16:38.997 --> 16:40.032
And you ...

16:40.067 --> 16:41.608
you are also Smith.

16:41.643 --> 16:44.748
And if there are two with the same name is entangled patrol.

16:44.783 --> 16:47.854
So you call yourself a stupid bastard.

16:47.889 --> 16:48.889
¡Smudge!

16:49.643 --> 16:51.883
Wanted to read all be clear, sergeant.

16:51.918 --> 16:54.640
Lest you be confused officers calling for

16:54.675 --> 16:56.617
our real names. Right?

17:07.426 --> 17:08.688
Hold this, Stab.

17:54.450 --> 17:55.886
See that bike?

18:47.706 --> 18:50.579
And ... how you handled the situation?

18:50.614 --> 18:53.580
I did what I had to do.

18:53.615 --> 18:56.511
I could not keep it to myself and you.

18:56.546 --> 18:59.700
Alli Llevábamos of weeks.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.983
And I could not get supplies.

19:03.607 --> 19:06.858
If you are the leader you have to be the head of the line.

19:07.660 --> 19:10.094
- You presided line? - Yes I did..

19:10.129 --> 19:12.708
I let him know the men who was upset.

19:12.743 --> 19:14.859
What we were in a shitty situation.

19:14.894 --> 19:17.792
- They can not do just that. - Why not?

19:17.827 --> 19:20.691
Because if they do, everything falls apart.

19:33.032 --> 19:34.216
Hello, Lieutenant.

19:34.251 --> 19:35.796
All set in front.

19:45.964 --> 19:47.021
Oye, Johnny.

19:47.056 --> 19:49.029
Tell me if you found it supplies.

20:06.148 --> 20:07.148
Staff,...

20:07.172 --> 20:09.026
Can you make that out?

20:09.061 --> 20:11.035
I have a fear of snipers.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.400
Good.

20:16.962 --> 20:19.100
I heard it was the day of prayer.

20:19.308 --> 20:21.274
They seem to take a while.

20:30.650 --> 20:32.274
I tell you something, Lieutenant.

20:32.452 --> 20:35.986
If you're going to be here a while could plant lettuce.

20:36.021 --> 20:38.751
Y so will eat vegetables.

20:40.229 --> 20:41.702
Leave it!

20:43.112 --> 20:44.870
I understand why you do not complain.

20:44.905 --> 20:47.120
You get to lose some weight.

20:47.155 --> 20:48.061
Yeah?

20:48.096 --> 20:50.264
The galeces not have that pint of skeletons.

20:50.299 --> 20:51.916
Yes. S because they are beasts.

20:53.151 --> 20:54.996
I hope that in me bizarre.

20:55.031 --> 20:55.969
That I never will.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.905
So take care with the 7 bridges.

21:11.834 --> 21:14.633
OPERATION Icarus.

21:14.668 --> 21:18.934
OPERATION Icarus. DAY 11.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.497

21:39.663 --> 21:41.746
You have to bring me ammo bitch!

21:42.730 --> 21:44.681
Do not waste ammunition.

21:44.716 --> 21:46.633
We're in a fucking war here.

21:46.668 --> 21:47.509
¡Maldito idiot!

21:47.544 --> 21:48.568

We have to move!

24:30.548 --> 24:32.245
¡Taff, come on!

24:32.280 --> 24:33.400
We need to move this.

24:33.435 --> 24:34.880
What the fuck happened!

24:36.589 --> 24:39.760
- What happened? - The American group never showed.

24:39.795 --> 24:41.495
So we're screwed as well and you?

24:41.530 --> 24:42.922
Muévanlo smooth.

24:44.602 --> 24:46.119
Beware the shoulder!

24:47.896 --> 24:48.996
Ten minutes.

24:49.730 --> 24:51.275
Manténganlo alto.

24:51.922 --> 24:54.375
Crossing the line WAS dangerous.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.163
Come on, guys. Gently.

24:56.198 --> 24:58.556
We must return to the center as soon as possible.

24:58.591 --> 25:00.201
Vamos. Tu y yo.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.674
Hang on ... what if?

25:07.430 --> 25:09.018
Pressed. Pressed.

25:13.378 --> 25:15.588
Okay, Taff. You'll make it.

25:18.013 --> 25:19.354
Nine minutes.

25:20.287 --> 25:23.394
Ginge y Smudge. Tomen las armas,
por favor.

25:44.088 --> 25:46.757
I think it is going to fulfill his dreams of fisher ...

25:46.792 --> 25:47.792
Correct.

25:48.527 --> 25:51.346
And what do you want? A boat?

25:51.381 --> 25:57.338
The helicopter will arrive in 6 minutes.

26:34.501 --> 26:36.247
It will land in 30 seconds.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.587
Boys.

29:16.452 --> 29:17.508
Boys!

29:22.509 --> 29:24.748
They did a good job today.

29:26.259 --> 29:27.639
A good job.

29:31.751 --> 29:33.828
We need to reorganize.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.832
Stab.

29:36.867 --> 29:38.709
You come with me and 1-0.

29:38.744 --> 29:39.744
Smudge.

29:40.351 --> 29:43.161
You're going to 1-1 with Sgt.

29:44.264 --> 29:45.700
Any questions?

29:47.943 --> 29:49.827
Both are very bad ammunition.

29:49.862 --> 29:51.146
¿No kidding?

29:51.508 --> 29:53.157
What the center says?

29:56.491 --> 29:57.553
Good.

29:57.708 --> 30:00.442
The Russians left them many RPG.

30:00.477 --> 30:03.143
For that you got the tracer bullets.

30:04.774 --> 30:06.548
Any other questions?

30:07.914 --> 30:08.944
¿Smudge?

30:10.935 --> 30:12.673
Nothing more, Captain.

30:13.473 --> 30:16.045
We take away the ammunition people we came to save.

30:19.555 --> 30:21.007
Johnny, contact the barracks.

30:21.042 --> 30:23.967
Dile if you give us the ammunition, it going to be looking for.

31:17.499 --> 31:18.642
Smudge.

31:21.699 --> 31:24.066
Why does the radio not work?

31:25.950 --> 31:28.230
How best guides a man?

31:30.812 --> 31:34.731
With a map and Nokia.

31:36.278 --> 31:38.265
What we said butts.

31:39.717 --> 31:41.999
- That no good for a shit. - Fuck you, Stab.

31:42.449 --> 31:45.062
¿No te enseñaron anything before venir here?

31:45.097 --> 31:46.113
It's over.

31:47.728 --> 31:48.822
Why?

31:49.496 --> 31:52.810
Because SAS threw them on the grill, and did not work.

31:52.845 --> 31:56.124
Then it's a decent thing to use American weapons.

31:56.159 --> 32:00.328
But, why we upgraded weapons and bad radios?

32:05.683 --> 32:08.724
Because nobody thought we were going to get into a war.

32:10.633 --> 32:13.766
In fact, a gun LA.12 is well developed.

32:15.507 --> 32:16.870
Fuck me, Lieutenant.

32:17.292 --> 32:18.616
Want to be next to Tony Blair?

32:18.651 --> 32:20.030
It is a good weapon.

32:20.065 --> 32:22.494
Well, Lieutenant! If it's so good,

32:22.529 --> 32:26.419
Answer me, what other army in the world uses?

32:26.454 --> 32:30.309
Russians, Iraqi ... Everyone uses the AK-47.

32:30.344 --> 32:32.642
Y or Yankees la M-16.

32:33.192 --> 32:35.132
Nadie an un SAE.

32:35.575 --> 32:37.775
Jamaican forces ...

32:42.319 --> 32:44.807
The defensive force of Jamaica.

32:45.688 --> 32:48.188
Let them give me! That explains it!

32:49.616 --> 32:51.810
The next time I come a dickhead with a machete,

32:51.845 --> 32:54.015
I hit on the head with the SAE.

32:58.248 --> 32:59.507
What I missed?

33:14.644 --> 33:16.146
I have ammunition.

33:16.937 --> 33:18.586
We'll have more tomorrow.

33:19.508 --> 33:21.710
Do not worry about your gun,

33:22.167 --> 33:25.550
because you'll already be with the machine gun that fits you.

34:27.315 --> 34:31.875
As an officer, you have to deal with the decisions of the commander,

34:35.053 --> 34:38.686
not have to agree, because we are not stupid.

34:40.344 --> 34:42.474
Do you think they believe in this?

34:42.840 --> 34:44.166
What do you believe?

34:45.266 --> 34:47.119
Later, do not know.

34:48.943 --> 34:51.284
You say your son will send 18 to Afghanistan

34:51.320 --> 34:53.628
because it is better to send it to the damn moon.

35:25.014 --> 35:26.696
Any news from Taff?

35:38.352 --> 35:39.859
Have you heard of Taff?

35:40.967 --> 35:42.300
Sorry, Bill.

35:44.461 --> 35:46.545
No news is good news.

35:47.490 --> 35:49.908
Do we say if they were bad news, boss?

37:44.855 --> 37:47.069
Could you give me those pornos?

37:48.604 --> 37:50.875
What? I found them.

38:00.073 --> 38:01.855
Want to browse, Stab?

38:04.399 --> 38:05.590
As you wish.

38:06.751 --> 38:09.584
You've seen few persons shells with what you wear in vivo.

38:09.619 --> 38:10.685
¡Stab!

38:11.440 --> 38:13.061
Do not like that?

38:17.801 --> 38:19.046
Oye, Stab.

38:19.823 --> 38:21.847
No you discouraged.

38:22.440 --> 38:24.002
You did what you could.

38:25.933 --> 38:27.253
Thanks, Ginge.

38:36.557 --> 38:39.109
Extract pudding mix.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.039
Amazing what I ate.

38:42.074 --> 38:43.779
Would was some chocolate?

38:45.008 --> 38:46.233
Pásamelo.

38:50.075 --> 38:51.075
What?

38:51.616 --> 38:52.859
¿The dividimos?

38:52.894 --> 38:54.766
Anybody want their damn underwear?

38:54.801 --> 38:55.952
Let Sun.

38:55.987 --> 38:57.535
In no le importing.

38:57.742 --> 39:00.082
Anyway, survives him.

39:00.117 --> 39:02.018
It will not need a fucking diet.

39:11.333 --> 39:14.193
OPERATION Icarus.

39:14.228 --> 39:17.645
DAY 13.

39:21.174 --> 39:22.506
What time is it?

39:22.937 --> 39:24.496
The Taliban surrendered?

39:24.531 --> 39:26.064
They are getting supplies.

39:26.099 --> 39:27.455
Wait a little.

39:28.237 --> 39:29.455
Great.

39:30.346 --> 39:33.506
Maybe not the end yet.

39:33.541 --> 39:35.224
Supplies ...

39:35.828 --> 39:37.750
This is good news. Right?

39:38.008 --> 39:39.187
What are they?

39:40.281 --> 39:43.194
If we are supplying means that we stay here.

39:46.041 --> 39:48.558
Standing, ladies.

39:49.477 --> 39:52.534
- Did you enjoy the rest, Smudge? - Yes, sergeant. Pretty.

39:52.909 --> 39:55.496
Pity you can not get me a coffee.

39:55.531 --> 39:56.919
In your fucking dreams.

39:56.954 --> 39:59.553
You are there, Sergeant. It's there.

40:00.318 --> 40:02.291
And somehow, it's more enjoyable.

40:02.326 --> 40:04.432
Better not, Smudge.

40:19.283 --> 40:21.510
- Are you ready mate? - Yes. Anytime.

40:23.145 --> 40:25.149
With this goal tied.

40:31.177 --> 40:32.386
¡Let's go!

40:46.641 --> 40:47.895
Would you repeat that?

40:47.907 --> 40:50.795
I bet that shot to the delivery area.

40:50.830 --> 40:52.190
You are more dude.

40:52.225 --> 40:56.845
If you do, damned would track the ball.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.802
Y would offer us a damn exchange.

40:58.837 --> 41:01.705
So my money goes into the pockets of the Taliban.

41:09.107 --> 41:10.428
How did you get the boat?

41:11.058 --> 41:12.882
I bought it in a bloody exchange.

41:12.924 --> 41:13.822
Pay attention!

41:13.857 --> 41:14.721
¡Ustedes of!

41:14.818 --> 41:15.982
Stay tuned!

41:17.991 --> 41:19.393
What happened to your head?

41:19.428 --> 41:20.660
No worry.

41:28.359 --> 41:30.176
I hope it is ours.

41:43.454 --> 41:45.138
The crest ...

41:57.756 --> 42:00.283
I do not know ... we are sending many bullshit.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.521
Someone is trying to tell us something.

42:02.556 --> 42:04.690
Do you think they do with some intention?

42:04.725 --> 42:07.629
Good. It's not as complicated as ordering a gin and tonic.

42:08.261 --> 42:11.899
And, as usual, should review the delivery points.

42:13.642 --> 42:15.823
No, if they do it on purpose.

42:15.858 --> 42:18.005
To confuse the enemy.

42:27.323 --> 42:29.387
Does taking responsibility?

42:29.422 --> 42:31.416
Of course you could.

42:31.451 --> 42:33.263
That's not what I mean.

42:33.298 --> 42:35.914
What I mean is that affected me.

42:35.949 --> 42:38.530
Like how it affected others.

42:38.987 --> 42:41.236
You used them, Captain.

42:41.271 --> 42:43.787
Do you think that reflects how you feel about your men?

42:43.822 --> 42:46.434
No. For nothing.

42:47.423 --> 42:49.745
We are a single unit, I feel the same.

42:49.780 --> 42:52.058
It is very embarrassing to be the leader,

42:52.093 --> 42:54.721
and do it, if that makes it more familiar.

42:55.782 --> 42:58.221
That's what being an officer.

42:58.256 --> 43:00.488
It is very lonely.

43:11.857 --> 43:13.705
- Hola, Bill. - Hola, Johnny.

43:13.916 --> 43:14.916
Where is the sun?

43:14.940 --> 43:19.234
Following a trail of identity in the village, with the lieutenant.

43:20.357 --> 43:21.876
We need to talk.

43:27.638 --> 43:29.296
Taff failed.

43:35.350 --> 43:39.067
They were going to have surgery, but died on the operating table.

43:45.670 --> 43:47.490
Bill. We should not tell others.

43:47.525 --> 43:48.680
Tonterias, Johnny.

43:48.715 --> 43:50.975
Really. I think desmoralizaremos.

43:51.010 --> 43:53.201
No. This will give them something to talk about.

43:53.236 --> 43:55.545
When they are quiet is when I worry more.

43:55.820 --> 43:58.715
Not the team, right? Tactics.

43:58.750 --> 44:01.479
Look, Johnny. Let me give you some good advice.

44:01.514 --> 44:04.173
Never hesitate when you are with men.

44:04.208 --> 44:07.019
They see you falter once and we'll all be in trouble.

44:10.652 --> 44:14.860
But if they find out what the fray of Staff, will be worse.

44:17.560 --> 44:20.315
Gather the men. I will give them the news.

45:27.966 --> 45:29.114
Knights.

45:31.110 --> 45:32.694
With a huge regret.

45:32.729 --> 45:36.427
The reports that Lance Evans cabo fallecío.

45:38.691 --> 45:40.933
I wanted to say, to everyone.

45:40.968 --> 45:43.710
Thanks for the huge effort to try to save him.

45:43.745 --> 45:46.021
But the place could not resist.

45:46.056 --> 45:49.258
And it's very admirable effort made,

45:49.293 --> 45:51.690
To bring him here alive.

45:54.042 --> 45:57.244
I need not remind you of the importance of our role here.

45:57.648 --> 45:59.594
Without us, without our assistance,

45:59.629 --> 46:03.304
There is no way that the Afghan National Army hold the town.

46:07.899 --> 46:10.668
Act like professional soldiers.

46:11.304 --> 46:13.411
Until the last moment.

46:17.522 --> 46:19.638
He would want us to continue.

46:21.992 --> 46:23.580
So let's do that.

46:24.514 --> 46:25.810
For him.

46:30.206 --> 46:31.875
Thank you, gentlemen.

47:12.057 --> 47:14.984
Here is Terry and that's us.

47:15.019 --> 47:17.912
And this is the valley where we are.

47:17.947 --> 47:19.752
Now, we got here.

47:19.787 --> 47:22.630
Tuvimos to turn al ERV here.

47:22.898 --> 47:24.140
Good ...

47:24.175 --> 47:26.090
Any questions?

47:32.187 --> 47:34.794
Does anyone know what the fuck is an ERV?

47:37.771 --> 47:38.788
Smudge.

47:39.352 --> 47:40.735
Yes, sargento.

47:40.770 --> 47:43.991
If I read Atonement, is a way of Volvo.

47:44.026 --> 47:46.570
Move the last chips.

47:50.837 --> 47:51.927
Stab.

47:55.079 --> 47:56.767
They NX Sending.

47:59.502 --> 48:00.964
Soldier, ...

48:00.999 --> 48:03.058
What the fuck are you saying?

48:11.225 --> 48:12.671
What great.

48:17.456 --> 48:18.456
It's okay.

48:18.478 --> 48:20.091
Stab.

48:20.126 --> 48:21.731
Quiet.

48:26.216 --> 48:28.660
Stab.

48:28.695 --> 48:31.105
Mira.

48:34.241 --> 48:37.798
The lieutenant will need your help today. OK?

48:40.550 --> 48:41.620
OK?

48:45.778 --> 48:47.425
You will be safe here.

48:47.882 --> 48:51.204
Safe. Do you understand?

48:51.653 --> 48:52.653
Yeah?

48:53.658 --> 48:58.269
All right. we leave now, but you can help us.

48:58.304 --> 49:01.380
Helping the lieutenant who is short of men.

49:01.670 --> 49:02.741
Yeah?

49:02.862 --> 49:04.664
Can I count on you?

49:06.582 --> 49:07.819
Good man.

49:50.683 --> 49:51.708
Hey, jefe.

49:52.552 --> 49:54.556
If I crawl leave me behind.

49:58.309 --> 49:59.724
What do you mean?

50:02.270 --> 50:05.569
Come on, would you join?

50:08.865 --> 50:10.412
You're the boss.

50:13.590 --> 50:14.955
It should help.

50:14.990 --> 50:16.647
Keeping busy.

50:16.682 --> 50:18.269
Does not sound very fair.

50:18.304 --> 50:21.468
We all receive the medal, but it's another to give you that.

50:21.503 --> 50:22.884
Do not insinuate that I am a coward, Smudge.

50:22.919 --> 50:24.845
I did not say that, do you?

50:25.213 --> 50:26.786
It sure did not.

50:29.383 --> 50:31.290
Today I go into the line of fire.

50:31.325 --> 50:33.563
Johnny, you're the radio.

50:33.598 --> 50:35.801
Here we can learn anything if you kill.

50:42.314 --> 50:43.513
Johnny, detente.

50:43.548 --> 50:44.370
I insist.

50:44.405 --> 50:45.951
No. Piensa en tu hija.

50:45.986 --> 50:47.497
Judith thinks every day.

50:58.381 --> 51:01.264
Very well. So ...

51:01.545 --> 51:04.118
You keep on track. Johnny goes up.

51:06.075 --> 51:07.568
No. Thank you, boss.

51:11.092 --> 51:12.197
I will mark the course.

51:12.232 --> 51:15.213
Sure we ended up at the home of the Taliban.

52:40.367 --> 52:42.300
Contact!

52:46.423 --> 52:47.423
Watch out!

52:50.203 --> 52:51.943
Step away from the vehicle!

52:55.311 --> 52:58.374
Fuck! Where the fuck out!

53:10.457 --> 53:12.052
Care, boss!

53:13.873 --> 53:15.799
Aim on tracer!

53:24.377 --> 53:25.779
Ammunition!

53:37.594 --> 53:38.992
Free Fire!

53:57.171 --> 53:58.508
All in!

53:59.051 --> 54:00.637
¡Come on ...!

54:13.267 --> 54:16.216
Was obviously el ERV

54:16.251 --> 54:19.166
They had no choice.

54:20.154 --> 54:21.209
Si.

54:23.944 --> 54:26.050
Hi, Zero. This is Silicon Uno Zero.

54:26.085 --> 54:28.122
Reporting two tanks in the area.

54:28.157 --> 54:30.841
Denying disable one. We will mark our position ...

54:30.876 --> 54:32.980
humo with green. Exchange.

55:09.694 --> 55:12.113
All right. It's over.

55:52.742 --> 55:54.335
1-0 Does not returned?

55:55.081 --> 55:56.790
The Taliban did shit.

55:57.234 --> 55:59.015
Orders came.

56:02.008 --> 56:03.261
They want to talk to you.

56:03.296 --> 56:05.276
The Americans are going to testify tomorrow

56:05.311 --> 56:06.752
and we with them.

56:06.787 --> 56:10.318
They want us to increase the activity in the field.

56:10.353 --> 56:13.007
Apparent that we have left.

56:15.811 --> 56:17.823
What about the air support?

56:18.665 --> 56:20.387
Did they endeavor now or not now?

56:53.696 --> 56:56.876
Everyone responds to its own nature.

56:57.917 --> 57:01.191
When you're faced with losing someone,

57:01.880 --> 57:05.518
to the mere possibility, terrify you.

57:05.865 --> 57:07.747
A reality.

57:09.130 --> 57:10.403
I know.

57:25.888 --> 57:27.788
I have an idea.

57:27.823 --> 57:31.716
Let us make a hole here, we try? OK?

57:31.751 --> 57:32.434
¡Smudge!

57:32.469 --> 57:35.140
Just say, 28 rounds of 5.8.5.6.

57:37.550 --> 57:40.040
¡Smudge! ¡Baja arma tu puta!

57:58.468 --> 58:01.030
But that ridge is going on here?

58:04.488 --> 58:08.235
The Smudge just condorear soldier, sir.

58:11.379 --> 58:16.168
I was cleaning my gun and shot herself.

58:17.510 --> 58:20.148
For Christ's sake, soldier Smudge!

58:22.199 --> 58:23.214
Well.

58:24.106 --> 58:26.781
We will address this when we get all camp.

58:28.676 --> 58:30.689
We are all under pressure.

58:30.724 --> 58:34.027
But that's the basic situations.

58:58.302 --> 58:59.302
Hey,

58:59.723 --> 59:02.191
Your always shoot your team?

59:03.219 --> 59:06.921
Just wondering, because this is terrible unusual.

59:08.895 --> 59:11.980
- What's going on, Smudge? - What happens to me?

59:12.171 --> 59:14.733
'What we are going to shit all!

59:18.771 --> 59:20.866
Less to you than just driving.

59:22.953 --> 59:25.851
And that does well to any dude.

59:25.886 --> 59:29.016
- No huevées with that. - I'm serious.

59:29.273 --> 59:31.424
- What if I refuse, soldier? - Look ...

59:31.459 --> 59:33.576
I have seen all the action you want to see.

59:33.611 --> 59:34.771
And now I want to go home,

59:34.783 --> 59:38.264
and bore my children with these experiences.

59:39.016 --> 59:40.672
In addition to rolling.

59:43.659 --> 59:44.761
Oye, Ginge.

59:45.790 --> 59:49.065
You'll have to kill idiots to take your dust.

59:54.871 --> 59:58.064
Okay, guys. Everyone is ready.

59:58.099 --> 59:59.543
Va to be a great day.

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:03.678
Follow the numbers and stay together. Yeah?

01:00:06.301 --> 01:00:07.301
Well.

01:00:15.799 --> 01:00:17.073
Smudge...

01:00:20.394 --> 01:00:21.579
Good luck.

01:00:23.849 --> 01:00:26.113
Cover your right, lieutenant.

01:00:27.038 --> 01:00:29.025
In IRTE knew you wanted.

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.086
Granada!

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.294
Home sweet home.

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:04.273
Good hunting, boys. They should give thanks for that.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.727
It is only a matter of time.

01:04:38.601 --> 01:04:39.664
Chief.

01:04:44.231 --> 01:04:46.009
With all due respect.

01:04:46.044 --> 01:04:48.467
Are we going to leave tomorrow?

01:04:48.502 --> 01:04:51.165
No reason for that, Sergeant.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.828
What if we lose another engine?

01:04:53.863 --> 01:04:56.273
And when we are in the dark?

01:04:56.308 --> 01:05:00.538
The best thing about Willie is the air conditioning.

01:05:00.573 --> 01:05:02.109
Because it has no roof.

01:05:02.144 --> 01:05:03.472
It's just because ...

01:05:03.507 --> 01:05:04.766
Now, cut that!

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:07.907
Cut it with just complain about everything!

01:05:08.358 --> 01:05:11.263
We're here and we have work to do.

01:05:11.298 --> 01:05:12.970
And we have to focus on that.

01:05:13.005 --> 01:05:15.655
Weapons may be crap, but I do not.

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.397
Really? Really?

01:05:18.432 --> 01:05:21.070
Because I ruined mine.

01:05:21.105 --> 01:05:24.833
Taff And they gave him to use the weapon descompuse.

01:05:28.372 --> 01:05:32.232
He got in the side and dodged the shield.

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:34.510
There you have it.

01:05:34.615 --> 01:05:36.117
Fuck you, Lieutenant.

01:05:36.152 --> 01:05:37.935
You need to stop imitating ... to ...

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:39.962
al puto "Señor Spock".

01:05:39.997 --> 01:05:41.920
You lose weight, bitch.

01:05:41.955 --> 01:05:45.451
With all due respect. You have no idea what to shit talk.

01:05:45.486 --> 01:05:47.278
So, Fuck you, sir!

01:05:47.313 --> 01:05:50.724
Soldier, Smudge! Will be discharged for insubordination!

01:05:50.759 --> 01:05:53.857
Come on! We are together. I did not mean it.

01:05:53.892 --> 01:05:54.687
¡Si quice!

01:05:54.722 --> 01:05:56.885
It seems, Sgt. In this unit.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.048
If there was anything more discipline,

01:05:59.083 --> 01:06:00.942
Cape Evans still be alive.

01:06:04.574 --> 01:06:07.237
The Smith soldier bitch deserves a reward.

01:06:07.272 --> 01:06:09.294
¡No you maldita baja!

01:06:22.769 --> 01:06:25.179
Why do I run so much?

01:06:28.152 --> 01:06:31.586
Sergeant Campbell. Soldier Smith. Get out of here. Now!

01:06:56.315 --> 01:06:58.827
You were serious about the MC?

01:07:01.383 --> 01:07:03.463
Do not take it personally ...

01:07:08.984 --> 01:07:12.354
So ... We cut this?

01:07:14.579 --> 01:07:17.560
But fuck you're talking about, Smudge?

01:07:17.595 --> 01:07:20.541
Do not you see? We're going on this shit!

01:07:20.576 --> 01:07:21.973
What is the difference?

01:07:22.008 --> 01:07:24.547
We uphold a country ahuevonado culiado.

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:27.057
So what? Just kill us any day.

01:07:27.092 --> 01:07:29.532
No one will know who the fuck we were.

01:07:31.066 --> 01:07:33.591
I'm in it since I was 15,

01:07:33.626 --> 01:07:36.120
If I can not be a soldier, then what I can be?

01:07:36.155 --> 01:07:40.648
I hate to tell you, but it was you jubilaras.

01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:45.453
Let Sun.

01:07:45.488 --> 01:07:48.170
We have nothing to huevear here.

01:07:55.677 --> 01:07:56.677
¡Well!

01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.912
I have new rules for patrol.

01:07:59.947 --> 01:08:04.369
Talks strategy or weapons are over.

01:08:04.575 --> 01:08:07.291
They can go to complain to the ministry of defense.

01:08:07.326 --> 01:08:09.483
We are the British army.

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.640
We have a job to do.

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:13.885
Are we clear on that?

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:17.462
I want to hear!

01:08:18.287 --> 01:08:19.365
¡Si, jefe!

01:08:21.804 --> 01:08:24.069
If, ... jefe.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:32.127
Is there anything else you want to add?

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:37.951
Well.

01:10:13.303 --> 01:10:16.272
OPERATION Icarus.

01:10:16.307 --> 01:10:19.645
DAY 15.

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:51.813
Hello, Zero. This is Silicon One Zero. Rates.

01:10:57.521 --> 01:11:01.280
Received, Zero. This is Silicon One Zero reporting. Rates.

01:11:06.946 --> 01:11:10.566
Roger. Thank you, Zero. Out.

01:11:14.857 --> 01:11:16.222
It is a girl.

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.015
Congratulations, sir.

01:11:36.007 --> 01:11:37.806
Congratulations, boss.

01:11:51.343 --> 01:11:53.606
I knew you were the Chancleteros ...

01:11:57.217 --> 01:11:58.467
Well done!

01:11:58.502 --> 01:12:00.153
I really did not do much.

01:12:00.188 --> 01:12:02.339
I'll give you a private training so you know.

01:12:02.374 --> 01:12:03.877
You'll see.

01:12:33.628 --> 01:12:35.648
The lieutenant has news, boss.

01:12:37.529 --> 01:12:40.515
It is a girl. Judith is well.

01:12:41.588 --> 01:12:43.589
Pasaste you, friend. Congratulations.

01:12:43.624 --> 01:12:45.596
All right! Above all!

01:12:46.392 --> 01:12:47.503
Head, ...

01:12:49.423 --> 01:12:51.529
I think we should end the day.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.148
What else do we have to prove?

01:12:56.183 --> 01:12:59.009
It is not that they have to try.

01:12:59.044 --> 01:13:03.095
Soldier Smith. Return to camp. I'll talk to the sergeant about this.

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:06.104
Chief.

01:13:07.486 --> 01:13:09.750
Do not take it to heart.

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:12.727
But I think Smudge is right now.

01:13:12.762 --> 01:13:14.625
It is not our war.

01:13:15.839 --> 01:13:17.624
I hate to say ...

01:13:18.662 --> 01:13:21.849
But I'm with the army chief.

01:13:21.884 --> 01:13:23.666
I can not believe goats.

01:13:25.115 --> 01:13:27.295
We paste to do!

01:13:33.299 --> 01:13:34.815
I'm in charge.

01:13:35.832 --> 01:13:39.447
This will take them all to a court martial. Do you understand?

01:13:41.598 --> 01:13:44.074
Now, let's get out of here today.

01:13:44.109 --> 01:13:46.550
If only I and Lieutenant.

01:13:46.761 --> 01:13:48.484
This is cowardice!

01:13:49.153 --> 01:13:51.085
They are making the ass to the brambles.

01:13:52.501 --> 01:13:54.564
Now métanse the vehicle.

01:13:58.318 --> 01:14:01.059
I think in the Listen, sir.

01:14:01.758 --> 01:14:05.299
Johnny does not want his daughter to grow up without knowing that her father loved.

01:14:05.334 --> 01:14:11.022
Because if you did ... That shit came to die here?

01:14:13.628 --> 01:14:17.076
You're right, Bill. It is not our war.

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:37.920
Bitch you was that good.

01:14:37.955 --> 01:14:39.417
You have your moments, Smudge.

01:14:40.137 --> 01:14:42.084
Call an air strike.

01:14:42.119 --> 01:14:44.032
While you are a B-2.

01:14:44.145 --> 01:14:47.747
Better a B-52. That makes this whole place burning.

01:14:47.782 --> 01:14:49.081
Nonsense, friend.

01:14:49.116 --> 01:14:51.115
You'll want to see the children alive.

01:14:51.815 --> 01:14:53.567
My witch goes descuerar me.

01:14:53.602 --> 01:14:54.936
Sorry, pal.

01:14:54.971 --> 01:14:56.782
Think you will have to worry about Terry.

01:14:56.817 --> 01:14:57.707
Smudge.

01:14:57.742 --> 01:14:59.469
You do not know my wife.

01:15:01.891 --> 01:15:04.344
We return to camp and none of this is mentioned.

01:15:04.379 --> 01:15:06.139
Who is going to believe that?

01:15:06.288 --> 01:15:07.735
I do not know.

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:29.456
I did the best I could.

01:15:33.065 --> 01:15:34.216
Sometimes I felt ...

01:15:34.251 --> 01:15:38.175
unsupported, abandoned.

01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:41.839
And I really do not get what I wanted.

01:15:42.449 --> 01:15:45.855
- So, questioned the orders? - That's right. The I questioned.

01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:47.424
And war.

01:15:51.248 --> 01:15:52.248
I'm serious.

01:15:52.272 --> 01:15:54.640
Andabamos What the fuck you doing?

01:15:55.410 --> 01:15:59.164
Enrredados spent 2 weeks with the Taliban.

01:15:59.199 --> 01:16:02.919
And when we left, walked straight to the inside.
