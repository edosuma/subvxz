00:02.160 --> 00:04.003
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:04.200 --> 00:07.886
<i>After five years in hell,
I returned home with only one goal,</i>

00:08.080 --> 00:09.605
<i>to save my city.</i>

00:09.840 --> 00:11.524
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:13.563
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

00:13.760 --> 00:16.525
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

00:16.720 --> 00:19.405
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

00:19.840 --> 00:21.410
Previously on Arrow...

00:21.600 --> 00:22.886
<i>The media's been
calling them the Ghosts.</i>

00:23.120 --> 00:24.610
They're <i>like</i> nothing
we'd ever seen before.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.080
<i>Anytime we get too close
to one of them,</i>

00:26.280 --> 00:27.725
they off themselves with cyanide.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.610
Darhk's Ghosts, they're H.l.V.E.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.768
<i>An organization called
H.l.V.E. killed my brother.</i>

00:31.960 --> 00:33.564
Taking Lyla, that was your idea, Oliver.

00:33.800 --> 00:34.961
<i>In front of our daughter.</i>

00:35.120 --> 00:38.124
You didn't just lose my friendship.
You lost my respect.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.450
<i>Thea, whatever
is going on with you,</i>

00:40.800 --> 00:41.926
the League, they'll know what to do.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.406
We're going to Nanda Parbat.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.802
Why are we not telling my brother?

00:46.120 --> 00:48.805
<i>Because you're not the only reason
for us going to Nanda Parbat.</i>

00:58.120 --> 00:59.042
Need a hand, John?

00:59.280 --> 01:02.602
<i>I'm good.
Varsity track, all-state, 100 meters.</i>

01:28.240 --> 01:29.162
Dig?

01:29.440 --> 01:31.761
Felicity, you know where
that son of a bitch went?

01:32.520 --> 01:34.329
He vanished.
We call them Ghosts for a reason.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.010
But I got air support
coming in on Number Two.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.600
<i>"ARROW". I got him.</i>

01:53.520 --> 01:54.806
Oliver?

01:55.480 --> 01:57.721
<i>- Oliver?
- He's all right, Felicity.</i>

01:57.880 --> 01:59.370
We need eyes back on our target.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.722
I'll give you one better than that.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.167
Twenty feet ahead,
I got one gift wrapped for you.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.210
Feels like old times, the three of us.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.880
The OGs, the original gangstas.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.767
You're not checking out
without answering a few questions first.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.765
Where can I find H.I.V.E.?
Who's behind the Ghosts?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.764
Answer me!

02:50.760 --> 02:52.000
Dig?

02:57.080 --> 02:58.411
Now, he's gone.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.080
Damn it!

03:00.760 --> 03:02.888
We needed
more boots on the ground, Oliver.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.202
Thea and Laurel
picked a fine day for a spa treatment.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.761
I don't think Thea would be much help
in the state of mind she's in.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.451
Where the hell did they go anyway?

03:20.120 --> 03:22.282
I really enjoy sparring with you, Nyssa.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.201
- I'm not sparring.
- I know.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.124
That's what makes it so much fun.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.804
You know I would show you no mercy
if given the opportunity.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.802
That's why I take great care
not to give you the opportunity.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.010
Next time, I'll take your head off.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.482
My liege, two foreigners are here.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.081
One of them claims to be
the daughter of Ra's al Ghul.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.766
No. lam his daughter.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.764
What a pleasant surprise.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.446
Sister-in-law.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.491
What brings you to Nanda Parbat?

04:15.680 --> 04:17.682
They have a coffin with them, my liege.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.600
A coffin?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.162
I want you
to bring my sister back to life.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.806
No.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.482
You took her life away from her.
It is your obligation to bring her back.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.848
I have no obligations in this house.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.522
You don't get to waltz in here and
demand a cup of tea, let alone this.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.371
Thea wasn't dead.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.890
- Sara is.
- Thanks to you.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.682
What you are asking for
hasn't been done in ages past.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.484
Even then, only in legend.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.691
Which is why I did not ask my father to
use the Pit to save Sara after she fell.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.043
Even if Sara went into the Pit,
even if it worked,

04:52.560 --> 04:56.281
who, what came out of the Pit
would not be Sara.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.407
Laurel, I am sorry, truly sorry.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.042
But, of course, my answer is no.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.968
Okay, I know that was kind of a bust,

05:11.200 --> 05:14.090
but wasn't it fun having the original
"Team Arrow" back together?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.846
- You shouldn't have.
- Got that off one of the Ghosts.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.411
It's where they hide
their cyanide capsules.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.768
Looks like an upper left bicuspid.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.366
There was a very brief time

05:25.560 --> 05:28.769
where I envisioned a future for myself
as a dental hygienist.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.242
The best lead we've gotten
in the last three months.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.006
It'll take the DNA sequencer
a little bit of time,

05:34.240 --> 05:37.449
so I was thinking margaritas
while we wait.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.841
You remember that place we went
after we took down the Dodger?

05:40.080 --> 05:42.208
Oh. What do you say?

05:43.040 --> 05:44.883
It's been a while
since it was just the three of us.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.770
I got a family to get back to.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.927
I guess he just needs more time.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.601
Time hasn't been doing anything.
Apologies haven't.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.966
What're you saying?

05:58.200 --> 06:02.683
I'm saying that
I'm done waiting for him to come around.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.130
Work faster!

06:14.640 --> 06:16.244
Like a fish to water.

06:17.640 --> 06:18.926
What did you say?

06:20.480 --> 06:21.811
People QOSSiP-

06:22.280 --> 06:24.931
They say that you're a rich kid
who got shipwrecked here.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.482
Bossing people around, giving orders.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.928
It must feel just like home to you.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.811
We got a runner!

06:36.160 --> 06:37.889
<i>Hey, watch your field.</i>

06:44.440 --> 06:47.011
Hey! Come on, man.
Let's do this the easy way.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.404
Yeah! That's the way.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.969
Well, what are you gonna do?
Talk him into surrendering?

06:57.320 --> 06:58.685
That's how you do it.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.760
Who are you?

07:17.920 --> 07:20.526
Definitely not someone
who deserves to be shot.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.681
Your wife and kid are out, by the way.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.530
Who are you?

07:24.840 --> 07:26.205
Relax.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.280
I'm a friendly.

07:30.960 --> 07:31.882
You're A.R.G.U.S.?

07:32.120 --> 07:34.202
He can read. Lyla sent me.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.364
My wife left the agency seven months ago.
She couldn't have sent you anywhere.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.126
She asked back
when she was still with the agency.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.562
Took me a while because, well, favors

07:42.880 --> 07:44.882
aren't exactly
at the top of my to-do list.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.725
Here, ID on whoever hired Floyd Lawton
to do a hit back in '09.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.490
"Mina Fayad"?

07:55.880 --> 07:56.881
Where can I find her?

07:57.080 --> 08:00.163
Well, that's the best part.
TSA flagged her coming in last night.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.889
Flew in from Markovia.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.087
<i>I'll contact you with her location.</i>

08:14.920 --> 08:18.606
Ah. Ms. Fayad. You brought a guest.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.411
As instructed.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.201
Not by me.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.205
The vigilante problem in this city
is greater than anticipated.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.568
Your partners in H.l.V.E.
asked me to take steps.

08:30.280 --> 08:33.443
You don't exactly look like
a problem solver. What do you do?

08:34.240 --> 08:36.561
I play cards, mostly.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.726
Perhaps a demonstration.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.924
Funny you should mention.
I happen to have just the problem.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.602
My operatives are under orders
to choose death before capture.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.407
This gentleman chose wrongly.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.962
They got to me before I could take
the countermeasure.

08:54.120 --> 08:57.806
He's also prone to excuses,
which I find tiresome.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.971
That was good.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.560
Ooh.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.960
<i>"JEREMY". That one was free.</i>

09:21.720 --> 09:24.166
Taking out the Green Arrow
and his friends,

09:24.800 --> 09:26.131
that'll cost.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.720
Deal.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.171
I'm not giving up.

09:49.680 --> 09:50.966
I'm never giving up.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.011
Because you're thinking only of yourself.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.850
I expected your support.

09:56.520 --> 09:57.521
I was counting on it.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.524
Then you never really knew me at all.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.687
The Pit gave my father a long life.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.364
Longer than what was natural
and much longer than he deserved.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.683
But he paid a dark price for it.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.207
A price Thea is no doubt paying now.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.044
I wouldn't wish it on my most
bitter enemy, let alone my beloved.

10:17.160 --> 10:20.130
I don't know if the Pit
can bring her back.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.051
And Malcolm's right.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.205
I don't know
what Sara will be like if it does.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.487
But what I do know is that I have to try.

10:28.720 --> 10:29.960
To what end?

10:30.400 --> 10:33.051
To have your sister
returned to you a monster?

10:35.160 --> 10:38.482
Her spirit, the part that we both love,

10:39.960 --> 10:42.247
that's the part that I have to believe
will come back.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.407
You're not doing this out of love,
you're doing this out of grief.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.484
I miss Sara, too.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.923
But she is gone, Laurel.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.720
Forever.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.730
I have accepted it.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.369
I think it's time you did, too.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.763
Still wishing you were a dental hygienist?

11:11.920 --> 11:14.241
More like a molecular biologist.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.571
You see this?

11:18.080 --> 11:19.366
No.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.723
In my defense, I flunked biology.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.604
Well, I got an A-plus,

11:23.760 --> 11:26.286
and I still have no idea
what the hell is going on here.

11:26.440 --> 11:30.081
This DNA has half of the genetic
markers that it should have, half.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.407
How's that possible?

11:31.600 --> 11:33.887
It's not. This guy should be nothing more
than a pile of goo.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.126
What now?

11:37.560 --> 11:39.801
Robbery at a parts store, Litchfield Ave.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.044
- Call Dig. Tell him I'll meet him there.
- Ah!

11:42.240 --> 11:43.969
Hold ups are a little below
your pay grade.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.362
You sure you don't want
the S.C.P.D. to handle this one?

11:46.640 --> 11:49.769
How effective have the police been
in solving the city's problems recently?

11:49.960 --> 11:51.246
That's a good point.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.642
John's still not answering his phone.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.121
I'll be fine.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.288
Still, I don't like you going out there
without backup.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.323
I'm not. I have you.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.164
That restraint you showed back there,

12:30.840 --> 12:32.330
- bury it.
- Here.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.605
Violence is the only thing
these losers understand.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.131
The guys out here who can't handle that,

12:37.360 --> 12:39.249
they either wash out
or end up doing the product,

12:40.600 --> 12:43.524
both of which are fast-tracks
to a bullet in the head.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.847
The product.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.650
Reiter hasn't told me a lot about it.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.844
He calls it Slam,
genetically modified hybrid,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.526
one part heroin poppy, one part coca leaf.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.011
Get you higher than the Empire State.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.440
<i>Conklin.</i>

12:56.000 --> 12:59.129
We got a problem.
Some Slam's missing, a whole cake.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.043
The runner was just a distraction.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.166
Any idea who did it?

13:05.280 --> 13:07.044
All right then, round them up!

13:07.880 --> 13:09.041
What are you gonna do?

13:09.200 --> 13:12.204
I told you, only one thing
these losers respond to.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.324
Get on the ground.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.565
Thanks for coming, by the way.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.245
Ms. Fayad wasn't sure it would work,

13:31.400 --> 13:34.722
but I knew you couldn't turn down
a good old fashioned robbery.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.611
Are you ready to call this yet?

14:36.960 --> 14:38.405
Now you can call it.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.291
Game's not over yet.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.326
Are you all right?

15:22.520 --> 15:25.330
Aside from the fact
that you won't help my friends?

15:25.960 --> 15:29.521
I wouldn't be helping Sara,
as you know more than anyone.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.685
What gave me away?

15:32.640 --> 15:34.688
When I was cautioning Laurel
about the effects of the Pit,

15:34.840 --> 15:36.649
I saw the look on your face.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.045
<i>You're feeling it, aren't you?</i>

15:39.840 --> 15:41.171
<i>The blood lust.</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:43.363
What's happening to me?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.365
The Pit contains traces of the souls

15:45.600 --> 15:47.841
of all the men and women
who have bathed in its waters.

15:48.200 --> 15:52.205
And what those waters restore
they can also take. Life for life.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.166
What are you saying?

15:54.440 --> 15:56.329
That you need to feed this impulse.

15:57.560 --> 15:58.846
Give in to it.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.282
Once you do, it will subside for a time.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.166
Okay.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.002
I'll just go on a killing spree.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.721
Thank you for the fatherly advice.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.646
Can you just, for a second,
pretend to be a normal father?

16:13.400 --> 16:14.970
Can you do that, Dad?

16:15.200 --> 16:17.965
Do you have anything remotely normal
to offer me?

16:21.240 --> 16:22.526
All right.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.083
There is something,
high in the mountains, a man.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.526
Some call him a sage.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.405
He has a way
with the ancient arts of healing.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.208
He may be able to help you with this,
though I am not sure.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.322
Does that qualify as being normal?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.170
Normal enough.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.605
Get some rest.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.531
We'll start at first light.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.771
- This hurt?
- Yeah, it stings.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.686
Good. That's what you get for trying
to take on a meta all by yourself.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.120
- A meta?
- Yeah!

17:03.680 --> 17:06.251
Turns out, Central City is missing one.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.762
A Jeremy Tell. Cisco says
we should call him "Double Down."

17:09.960 --> 17:11.290
Which doesn't exactly make sense,

17:11.520 --> 17:13.921
since he was getting a tattoo
when the dark matter wave hit.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.359
You missed quite a show, tonight.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.528
Sorry I couldn't help out.
It's a long story.

17:17.760 --> 17:21.651
Oh, my God. it is not a long story.
It is the shortest story in history.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.371
Two guys go take on criminals
without asking for backup

17:24.599 --> 17:26.443
and nearly get killed in the process.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.642
You know,
I haven't said anything up till now,

17:28.880 --> 17:30.291
because I was hoping that the two of you

17:30.560 --> 17:32.130
would remove your heads
from your own asses

17:32.320 --> 17:33.970
without assistance.
Turns out, I was wrong.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.127
Hey, Felicity...

17:35.400 --> 17:37.243
No, no, no. This is the part where I talk
and you two listen.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.249
The both of you nearly got killed
out there tonight

17:39.440 --> 17:41.488
because you didn't have
each other's backs.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.722
That was a one-time deal, Felicity.
It won't happen again.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.285
I absolutely agree.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.007
Because the two of you
are going to sit down here

17:48.160 --> 17:49.764
until you have resolved your issues.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.240
Do we have an understanding?

17:52.240 --> 17:53.844
_l-ley__
Do we have an understanding?

17:55.960 --> 17:57.166
Yeah.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.164
I'm gonna take this
to a guy at Palmer Tech

17:59.320 --> 18:02.847
to find out how some lunatic meta
turns tattoos into lethal weapons.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.768
If you two haven't figured out
your issues by the time I get back,

18:06.960 --> 18:10.521
I'm gonna find a bunch of Mirakuru
soldiers to knock some sense into you.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.361
It's been months, man.

18:27.600 --> 18:31.525
And I don't know how many apologies...

18:31.680 --> 18:33.523
I mean, John, you're a forgiving person.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.206
Oliver, this isn't about forgiveness, man.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.200
I don't know how
to move forward with this, us.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.362
Doing what we do.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.211
- We've worked fine since I got back.
- We've got lucky.

18:45.720 --> 18:49.042
Oliver, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.050
And I don't know if I would do that now.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.210
Which means that even when we're
out there, we are not out there together.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.324
You crossed a line, man.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.690
And the fact that you could do that again
sits in the back of my head somewhere.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.245
<i>L</i> get it! <i>I</i> get it.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.164
I understand that I crossed a line.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.886
I understand that I lost your trust.

19:07.080 --> 19:12.246
What I do not understand is why you
won't give me a chance to earn it back.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.568
You think this meta tonight
is connected to Darhk?

19:24.760 --> 19:26.603
I don't know. Uh...

19:28.000 --> 19:30.526
He mentioned a new player, a woman.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.246
Fayad.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.571
We need to go.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.440
Where?

19:40.920 --> 19:43.446
Some place where I'm gonna try
to trust you again.

19:48.760 --> 19:51.411
I like to think of all of us as a team.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.128
Teammates need to trust each other.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.125
Right now,
I'm having a little difficulty doing that.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.601
I want y'all to tell me
who stole the product,

20:01.800 --> 20:03.882
or else this man right here
is gonna eat a bullet.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.726
Nobody?

20:10.960 --> 20:12.644
Let's try this again.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.806
Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.960
You said that violence is the only thing
these people respond to.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.327
Doesn't seem to be working.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.960
Well, what do you have in mind,
harsh language?

20:24.320 --> 20:26.641
I've been on this island three years.
I've learned some things.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.165
About what?

20:29.640 --> 20:30.926
Pain.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.088
- Uh-oh.
- "Uh-oh"?

20:41.280 --> 20:44.568
Those aren't the words you wanna say
when your CEO walks into a room.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.690
Well, technically, "uh" and "oh"
aren't words, they're interjections...

20:47.840 --> 20:50.684
Please tell me these are the prototypes
for our new world-changing technology.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.649
Since I'm inventing them,
wouldn't that make them my...

20:52.840 --> 20:54.080
What is this?

20:54.320 --> 20:56.607
<i>Contact lenses
with built-in HD displays.</i>

20:56.800 --> 20:58.165
<i>Ooh, That's impressive and fast.</i>

20:58.360 --> 20:59.850
- How much would they sell for?
- 100,000.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.768
- $100,000?
- Per lens.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.486
Hmm.

21:06.920 --> 21:07.967
<i>Everything okay?</i>

21:08.200 --> 21:10.851
Yeah, my phone just keeps acting up.
Need to restart it.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.202
Ooh!

21:14.160 --> 21:15.161
Ah!

21:15.360 --> 21:18.330
This is an autonomous
communications device.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.206
Which is great, except for the fact
that it spontaneously explodes.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.361
Okay, maybe you need something
to get your mind off all this.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.966
Like a little side project,
clear your head.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.040
Like gambling?

21:33.560 --> 21:34.561
I need a full workup.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.201
It's possible it's made out of
some sort of bio-organic material.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.881
I need to know everything
that you can find out about it.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.164
Strange. These edges.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.409
It doesn't look mass manufactured.
Where'd you find it?

21:45.120 --> 21:46.042
Casino.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.641
- You gamble?
- Oh, yeah! All the time. Poker's my jam.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.684
It ruined an outside flush for me.
I think my opponent was cheating.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.725
So, you want me to check it
for evidence of marking or something?

21:55.880 --> 21:57.245
Yeah, anything strange,
out of the ordinary.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.005
Like you playing poker?

22:00.840 --> 22:02.365
I will check back in on you later.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.205
- Oh, and, uh, Ms. Smoak?
- Mmm?

22:04.400 --> 22:08.007
There's no such thing
as an "outside flush" in poker.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.562
That's probably why I lost.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.001
You remember Russia?

22:20.200 --> 22:22.521
Two years ago,
when we got Lyla out of that prison?

22:22.760 --> 22:24.000
Of course.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.283
That night, Lawton told me that my brother

22:26.440 --> 22:28.283
was not collateral damage
in a hit gone bad.

22:28.520 --> 22:29.760
That he was the target.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.924
And that Lawton was hired
by an organization called H.l.V.E.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.441
The other week you reacted

22:35.600 --> 22:38.843
when I said that Ra's called Darhk's men
a "hive" of operatives.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.406
Mmm-hmm.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.605
Could be a coincidence.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.126
I don't think so.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.200
Last page.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.283
That woman hired Lawton
to kill my brother.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.131
And I'm betting she hired that meta
that tried to take you out.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.806
- Based on what?
- Her name is Mina Fayad.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.042
Two years and you didn't tell me.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.810
We have more in common than you think.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.762
Oliver, that's my first legitimate lead.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.286
I have to find her.

23:21.160 --> 23:24.084
Ms. Fayad hired you for one job, one.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.166
Against my objections
and only because my associates

23:27.320 --> 23:29.402
are anxious to progress to Phase Three.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.090
We shouldn't talk about Genesis...

23:31.280 --> 23:33.487
Don't lecture me about secrecy.

23:34.160 --> 23:37.289
Particularly on the same night
that you were just compromised.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.521
<i>' 'L</i>

23:38.680 --> 23:41.843
In the same night that I lost good men
in the name of protecting you.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.527
- Damien.
- Mr. Darhk!

23:48.120 --> 23:50.327
I think I require another demonstration.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.684
You want me to kill her now?

23:56.680 --> 23:57.966
Show me.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.366
Try to kill me.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.042
I kill you, I still get paid?

24:06.520 --> 24:07.851
Do it.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.040
What are you?

24:19.160 --> 24:20.321
Ms. Fayad,

24:20.560 --> 24:23.962
many members of H.l.V.E.,
they consider me to be a charlatan.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.449
That this, this is a parlor trick,

24:28.960 --> 24:30.200
sleight of hand.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.048
This demonstration was for you, Mr. Tell.

24:42.960 --> 24:46.123
Just in case you have any doubt
as to how I process disappointment.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.480
How do you feel?

25:22.600 --> 25:23.840
How do...

25:24.480 --> 25:25.845
How do I feel?

25:28.720 --> 25:30.006
Oh, my God.

25:31.320 --> 25:33.129
There is no sage.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.491
There is no cure.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.120
There never was.

25:37.480 --> 25:38.641
I'm sorry.

25:38.840 --> 25:42.242
You will be compelled to kill until
you've slain the one who hurt you.

25:42.560 --> 25:46.121
But I can't. Okay, Ra's is already dead.

25:46.360 --> 25:50.126
Then the only way to cope
is to indulge the blood lust on others.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.000
So you...

25:53.000 --> 25:55.287
You set your men up to be slaughtered?

25:55.480 --> 25:58.529
You will not feel the hunger
to kill again for weeks.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.171
No need to thank me.

26:01.880 --> 26:06.283
There is nothing I wouldn't do
to help my daughter.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.242
I hope we learned a lesson of the benefits
of trusting our friends with our problems.

26:19.560 --> 26:20.846
You mean, like your boyfriend?

26:21.040 --> 26:23.042
You're supposed to be
more evolved than him.

26:23.360 --> 26:26.045
- Hmm?
- Sorry, but he is.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.170
- Can we find her?
- No.

26:28.560 --> 26:31.211
She's not coming up on any
of our traffic or security cams.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.807
But I think I have the next best thing,
her cell phone. Or at least

26:34.000 --> 26:36.651
the one that followed her through airport
security on the way to Star City.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.370
Where's her phone now?

26:39.480 --> 26:40.720
Redmond and 8th.

26:48.280 --> 26:51.284
So, which fancy private school
you pick this up in?

26:51.520 --> 26:52.760
Learned it here.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.963
Three years on this island, and I have
been hurt every way you can imagine.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.840
I know what kills,

27:00.040 --> 27:01.326
I know what cripples,

27:01.520 --> 27:02.851
and what just hurts.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.244
Stop! Stop.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.844
He didn't take the drugs.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.280
I did.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.766
You're working us too hard,
and some of the other prisoners are hurt.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.283
I wanted to give them
something for the pain.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.649
And where's the Slam now?

27:21.880 --> 27:23.166
It's all used up.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.449
And I'm not going to tell you by who,

27:25.760 --> 27:27.922
so if you're going to kill me,
just get on with it.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.046
Suit yourself.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.410
Wait, wait, wait.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.840
You've already executed
one prisoner today.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.924
How's Reiter gonna feel about
you exterminating his work force?

27:40.640 --> 27:42.881
Oh, I think he'll make an exception
for a thief.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.764
Or I just make her disappear.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.360
Take her someplace.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.843
They'll never find the body.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.449
All right, take her.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.406
Keep them company.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.805
- Wake up. Wake up, we need to go.
- What?

28:14.640 --> 28:15.971
It was a mistake to come here.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.322
- Thea.
- Stay the hell away from me.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.766
Thea, what's wrong?

28:19.960 --> 28:22.725
He's not gonna help Sara,
and he's not gonna help me.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.321
- Thea!
- Don't talk to me.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.602
- I was only trying to help you...
- Help me?

28:27.960 --> 28:30.281
Yeah, that's funny
on more than a few levels.

28:30.680 --> 28:34.401
My favorite is you are the reason
why I am like this in the first place.

28:34.600 --> 28:35.806
I know.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.685
I will not kill people.

28:39.520 --> 28:40.851
I won't.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.525
Just stay out of my life
and the hell away from me.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.968
<i>"MALCOLM". We are bound together, forever.</i>

28:48.200 --> 28:50.771
You and me, father and daughter.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.691
Let me prove it to you.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.087
How?

28:55.280 --> 28:57.362
I am responsible for Sara's death.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.885
Yet, I have the means to make it right,
or at least try to.

29:01.080 --> 29:05.722
Do you think, after knowing
what that Pit has done to me,

29:05.920 --> 29:08.127
that I would let that happen to Sara?

29:08.320 --> 29:10.926
I think if you are truly sincere
in fighting your blood lust,

29:11.120 --> 29:13.361
you would offer the same to Sara.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.160
What are you saying?

29:16.160 --> 29:18.401
That I am willing to heal
my daughter's conscience

29:18.600 --> 29:21.285
by restoring your sister's life.

29:23.640 --> 29:26.883
That we should prepare Sara's body
for the ceremony.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.009
I'm still getting a ping
off Ms. Fayad's cell phone.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.480
Ten <i>feet</i> ahead.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.480
John.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.009
<i>It was my first chance for answers.</i>

30:01.080 --> 30:02.366
My last chance.

30:03.160 --> 30:05.401
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be, Oliver.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.760
This isn't your fault. It's mine.

30:09.800 --> 30:14.249
I should've trusted you.
Told you about this forever ago.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.331
If I had, she wouldn't have gotten
away from me earlier.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.211
Would be alive enough now
for some answers.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.081
We're gonna get answers.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.124
Oliver, I haven't been able to get answers
for more than two years now.

30:27.360 --> 30:31.968
For more than two years,
you've been doing this alone.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.403
You want me to take a look
at your phone for you, Ms. Smoak?

30:44.640 --> 30:46.563
I think we've reached the point
in our working relationship

30:46.800 --> 30:48.450
where you can call me Felicity.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.486
Have you ever considered
how ironic your name is?

30:52.280 --> 30:56.285
"Felicity" refers to the ability to find
appropriate expression for one's thoughts,

30:56.480 --> 30:58.881
which is not exactly something
you're particularly good at.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.770
Yeah. You're right.
Let's stick with Ms. Smoak.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.411
Any luck on our playing card?

31:03.360 --> 31:06.364
Yeah, it's actually right there, Felic...
Uh, Ms. Smoak.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.768
- Mmm-hmm.
- Except it's not a playing card at all.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.201
Now, in my experience,

31:10.400 --> 31:12.846
playing cards don't contain
motor proteins and proprioceptors

31:13.040 --> 31:14.121
and a neural net.

31:14.320 --> 31:15.446
The responsible thing to do

31:15.680 --> 31:16.966
would be to get this back
to its rightful owner.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.845
Is there any way to track him down?

31:20.080 --> 31:22.082
Well, if you tell me the truth
about where you got it from,

31:22.320 --> 31:23.651
that could speed along the process.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.080
I did tell you the truth.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.002
I did. Now, tracking the owner?

31:28.240 --> 31:30.288
You see this ink here,
for lack of a better word?

31:30.480 --> 31:33.211
<i>It's magnetite, which is
the key component to tattoo ink.</i>

31:33.400 --> 31:34.606
- You don't say.
- I do.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.168
I also say that magnetite happens to
guide the internal compass of birds,

31:38.360 --> 31:39.600
specifically homing pigeons.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.327
So is it possible to use the magnetite
in the card to get a location on our, um,

31:43.560 --> 31:44.607
D0ker player?

31:44.840 --> 31:48.128
Theoretically. Though, if your
hypothetical poker opponent

31:48.320 --> 31:51.722
has a deck full of these cards,
he'll probably be able to find you faster.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.724
Curtis, we have to...

31:56.360 --> 31:58.010
I'm gonna make you two a deal.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.644
The first one to tell me
where you can find the Green Arrow

32:01.920 --> 32:03.331
gets to live.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.085
- Green Arrow?
- I have a better idea.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.611
Run!

32:10.920 --> 32:13.446
Ms. Smoak, I really need to know
what's going on here.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.131
Does the board of directors know
there's a secret elevator in the building?

32:21.840 --> 32:23.729
- Since when are you such a bad ass?
- Since always.

32:23.960 --> 32:25.485
- Okay, I have multiple questions.
- Okay.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.682
Obviously, there's
a very long explanation to this.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.649
The short version is that
I work with the Green Arrow.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.087
This man is trying to kill me,
well, us, sorry.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.408
And I'm taking us down to the
only place that we're gonna be safe.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.722
- The lobby?
- Not exactly.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.365
You have a hidden floor.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.046
We should be safe here, but just in case.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.362
I think I know
where I can find the Green Arrow.

32:53.560 --> 32:56.040
Which means that offer
about not killing you is off the table.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.248
Stay here, do not move.

32:58.440 --> 33:00.602
- You know how to use that thing?
- No.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.802
Curtis? Curtis?

33:40.960 --> 33:43.611
- Felicity?
- I'm here. I'm here. I'm okay.

33:43.800 --> 33:44.801
What happened?

33:45.040 --> 33:47.850
Your meta came back
to retrieve his ace of spades.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.129
And you fended him off?

33:50.320 --> 33:51.651
Don't sound so surprised.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.520
Okay, I had a little bit of help
from a co-worker, but to be honest,

33:54.760 --> 33:56.603
- he was more freaked out than I was.
- Is he all right?

33:56.840 --> 33:58.330
Yes, he's fine.
I sent him to Starling General.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.409
And he only knows about my secret,
not yours.

34:00.640 --> 34:01.766
If he can trace the cards back here,

34:01.960 --> 34:03.007
can we use the cards to trace back to him?

34:03.200 --> 34:05.248
That is exactly what Curtis,
my freaked-out co-worker,

34:05.480 --> 34:07.005
was doing when...

34:07.520 --> 34:08.760
I got something.

34:09.639 --> 34:10.846
He's headed for the Star City expressway.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.963
Probably hightailing his way
back to Central City.

34:13.159 --> 34:14.685
Too bad he's not gonna make it.

34:33.520 --> 34:36.364
I will see you all dead
before I let you do this.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.724
Laurel, please. Don't.

34:40.320 --> 34:41.924
Are you sure you wanna do this?

34:42.880 --> 34:44.210
Just keep going.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.451
Wait, what's wrong?

35:12.680 --> 35:15.524
I told you.
The Pit has never been used for...

35:15.720 --> 35:17.051
No, wait.

35:18.240 --> 35:19.526
Look.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.640
Sara?

35:46.640 --> 35:47.880
Hold her!

35:50.880 --> 35:52.928
Sara! Sara!

35:55.080 --> 35:56.320
Sara, it's okay.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.085
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

35:59.640 --> 36:01.927
It's okay. It's okay.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.123
You guys are a special kind of stupid.

36:34.280 --> 36:36.282
I was gonna blow town, call it a draw.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.608
Not until you tell us about your employer.

36:45.800 --> 36:49.122
Where's H.l.V.E.?
Who's behind the Ghosts? Tell me!

36:49.440 --> 36:51.124
You know what your problem is?

36:52.200 --> 36:54.567
You don't scare me
half as much as he does.

36:55.640 --> 36:56.846
Look out!

37:09.800 --> 37:12.644
- You okay?
- Yeah. Kevlar held.

37:17.720 --> 37:19.245
You took a bullet for me.

37:19.880 --> 37:25.171
They were meta-human tattoo playing cards.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.684
Still counts, Oliver. Still counts.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.770
To OTA.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.524
Original Team Arrow.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.524
Sorry. I know you hate it
when I call us that.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.006
It's growing on me.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.089
Cisco has our meta in lockup
at Iron Heights.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.204
Yeah. We still can't get any intel.
He's too afraid of Damien Darhk.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.249
So am l.
What are the odds that Double Down

37:56.440 --> 37:57.851
told Darhk about Lair 2.0?

37:58.040 --> 38:01.044
Enough that we should start
thinking about Lair 3.0.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.931
I've been working on something.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.526
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.889
Thought you would've learned your lesson
about keeping secrets from friends.

38:08.360 --> 38:09.805
It's not a secret.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.884
It's a surprise.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.290
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

38:16.560 --> 38:17.800
Torturing that man.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.565
You don't even know what his name is.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.643
- Walk faster.
- Elias.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.451
That was his name, Elias.

38:23.640 --> 38:26.405
- Faster.
- I'm in no rush to get to my death.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.041
I'm trying to put some distance
between us.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.570
- Between us and Richards?
- No. Between us and...

38:42.160 --> 38:43.571
Between us and the landmine.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.084
Listen to me. lam not going to kill you.

38:47.760 --> 38:51.162
But you need to trust me,
or we're both dead. Do you understand?

38:52.400 --> 38:54.164
- Yes.
- Okay.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.680
Hey-

39:04.240 --> 39:05.480
You Okay?

39:05.760 --> 39:08.684
Well, the only thing wounded
is my workspace.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.363
Oh, and if Mr. Dennis asks,

39:11.600 --> 39:13.602
please just tell him
that all this happened

39:13.800 --> 39:18.124
because an experiment I was running
had an unforeseen outcome.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.485
Thank you for not letting him know

39:21.680 --> 39:23.205
that there is a secret lair
in the basement.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.210
I'm a full service employee.

39:25.600 --> 39:29.605
You seem pretty calm for a guy
who nearly got killed by a meta-human.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.885
Ms. Smoak, I came to Palmer Tech

39:34.120 --> 39:36.043
so I can help make this city
a better place.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.569
Can you even imagine how excited I am

39:38.800 --> 39:41.167
to know that my boss
is doing exactly that?

39:42.120 --> 39:43.884
Well, you really helped out, Curtis.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.643
The Green Arrow...
We couldn't have done it without you.

39:55.320 --> 39:56.810
<i>Ms. Smoak, is everything okay?</i>

39:57.960 --> 39:59.200
I don't know.

40:04.320 --> 40:05.606
It's okay.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.482
Everything's gonna be okay.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.049
Dad's not gonna believe it.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.362
He's gonna be so happy when he sees you.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.565
- Laurel?
- It's fine.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.966
The same thing happened to you
when you first came out of the Pit.

40:24.680 --> 40:26.170
She's just taking longer.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.841
- It's probably because she was...
- Laurel, we are in uncharted waters here.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.691
I suggest you prepare yourself
for the worst.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.162
My liege, something has happened.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.486
What have you done?

40:57.160 --> 40:59.322
My father was not a trusting man.

41:02.360 --> 41:03.885
He devised means to destroy the Pit

41:04.040 --> 41:06.611
should its powers
fall into the wrong hands.

41:06.880 --> 41:08.041
Like yours.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.202
Nyssa, why would you
do something like this?

41:10.760 --> 41:13.047
How can you even look at your sister
and ask me that?

41:14.520 --> 41:16.887
One day, I will have my moment,

41:17.600 --> 41:19.090
and I will kill you.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.526
And now when I do,

41:22.360 --> 41:24.522
there will be no coming back.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.051
Take her!

41:28.880 --> 41:31.406
I warned you, Laurel. I begged you.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.771
What happened to Sara last year
was on Malcolm's hands.

41:35.080 --> 41:38.721
But what's happening to her now
is on yours.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.321
English - SDH
