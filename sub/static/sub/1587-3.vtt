You don't want the Queen to hear, do you?

04:42.960 --> 04:45.930
A thousand gold cloaks
are searching for you.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.002
And if they found you,

04:48.080 --> 04:51.163
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the King?

04:51.240 --> 04:53.129
I didn't murder anyone.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.851
I know. But you must admit,
it looks suspicious.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.922
The King who executed your father,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.162
who tormented you for years,

05:00.240 --> 05:02.766
and you fled the scene of his murder.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.085
Why did you kill him?

05:05.560 --> 05:07.801
Because he was a drunk and a fool,

05:07.880 --> 05:10.724
and I don't trust drunk fools.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.006
He saved me.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.165
Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders.
Every one of them.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.530
And he did it all for gold.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.080
Money buys a man's silence for a time.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.609
A bolt in the heart buys it forever.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.731
He was helping me because I saved his life.

05:31.800 --> 05:35.725
Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace

05:36.120 --> 05:38.930
that once belonged to his grandmother.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.811
The last legacy of House Hollard.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.602
I had it made a few weeks ago.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.084
What did I once tell you about the capital?

05:57.800 --> 05:59.723
"We're all liars here."

06:01.600 --> 06:03.489
Come, my lady.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.801
I know you've had a difficult day.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.522
But you're safe now.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.728
I promise you that.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.565
You're safe with me,

06:13.640 --> 06:16.086
sailing home.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.927
So am I the queen?

06:24.200 --> 06:25.964
More than you were with Renly.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.326
Less than you would have been

06:27.400 --> 06:31.962
if Joffrey had done you the courtesy
of consummating the marriage before dying.

06:32.480 --> 06:36.929
This would not be
an opportune moment to press the issue.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.768
Clawing at his own throat,
looking to his mother to make it stop...

06:40.840 --> 06:41.921
It was horrible.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.321
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.004
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.403
They brought me your grandfather's body
when he died.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.209
Made me look at it.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.765
What was it like?

06:54.840 --> 06:57.969
They took me to the Great Hall.
There he was.

06:58.720 --> 07:02.691
The man I'd married
and suffered to father my children.

07:03.280 --> 07:08.889
A great doughy lump I'd sat next to
at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.526
There he was,

07:12.280 --> 07:14.009
lying on a table.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.127
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

07:20.200 --> 07:22.123
and was stabbed through the heart.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.362
Another was happiest torturing animals

07:24.440 --> 07:26.807
and was poisoned at our wedding feast.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.570
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.485
Your circumstances have improved markedly.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.245
You may not have enjoyed watching him die,

07:36.320 --> 07:38.129
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

07:38.200 --> 07:40.168
being married to him, I
can promise you that.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.282
But I would have been the queen.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.408
Our alliance with the Lannisters

07:44.480 --> 07:47.927
remains every bit as necessary to them
as it is unpleasant for us.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.326
You did wonderful work on Joffrey.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.728
The next one should be easier.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.930
TYWIN: Your brother is dead.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.002
Do you know what that means?

08:14.080 --> 08:16.401
I'm not trying to trick you.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.289
It means I'll become king.

08:20.360 --> 08:23.569
Yes, you will become king.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.847
What kind of king do you think you'll be?

08:27.280 --> 08:29.362
- A good king?
- TYWIN: Mmm.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.483
I think so as well.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.690
You've got the right temperament for it.

08:36.679 --> 08:39.159
But what makes a good king? Hmm?

08:39.960 --> 08:43.043
What is a good king's
single most important quality?

08:43.120 --> 08:45.088
This is hardly the place or the time.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.122
- Holiness?
- Hmm.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.647
Baelor the Blessed was holy.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.889
And pious.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.644
He built this Sept.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.763
He also named a 6-year-old boy High Septon

09:00.840 --> 09:03.969
because he thought
the boy could work miracles.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.131
He ended up
fasting himself into an early grave

09:08.200 --> 09:12.489
because food was of this world
and this world was sinful.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.607
Hmm.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.283
- Justice.
- Mmm.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.482
A good king must be just.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.490
Orys I was just.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.040
Everyone applauded his reforms,

09:27.120 --> 09:29.122
nobles and commoners alike.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.362
But he wasn't just for long.

09:32.120 --> 09:35.647
He was murdered in his sleep
after less than a year by his own brother.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.889
Was that truly just of him?

09:38.960 --> 09:43.443
To abandon his subjects to an evil that
he was too gullible to recognise?

09:43.680 --> 09:45.808
- No.
- No.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.965
- What about strength?
- Yes.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.281
Strength.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.125
King Robert was strong.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.288
He won the rebellion

09:58.360 --> 10:01.170
and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.

10:02.120 --> 10:06.603
And he attended three Small Council
meetings in 17 years.

10:06.760 --> 10:11.004
He spent his time whoring and hunting
and drinking

10:11.080 --> 10:13.367
until the last two killed him.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.043
So, we have a man
who starves himself to death,

10:18.440 --> 10:21.649
a man who lets his own brother murder him,

10:21.720 --> 10:25.167
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.128
What do they all lack?

10:34.880 --> 10:36.530
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

10:36.760 --> 10:39.286
- Wisdom is what makes a good king.
- Yes.

10:40.680 --> 10:43.251
But what is wisdom? Hmm?

10:45.520 --> 10:49.764
A house with great wealth and fertile lands
asks you for your protection

10:49.840 --> 10:55.165
against another house with a strong navy
that could one day oppose you.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.645
How do you know
which choice is wise and which isn't?

10:59.200 --> 11:02.647
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

11:02.720 --> 11:05.371
or shipyards and soldiers?

11:05.440 --> 11:07.886
- No.
- TYWIN: Of course not.

11:08.240 --> 11:11.289
A wise king knows what he knows
and what he doesn't.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.127
You're young.

11:13.880 --> 11:19.887
A wise young king listens to his counsellors
and heeds their advice until he comes of age.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.203
And the wisest kings

11:22.280 --> 11:25.329
continue to listen to them long afterwards.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.765
Your brother was not a wise king.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.328
Your brother was not a good king.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.448
If he had been,

11:33.520 --> 11:36.126
perhaps he'd still be alive.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.170
Now, as the king, you will have to marry.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.645
Do you understand why?

11:41.760 --> 11:43.285
TOMMEN: A king needs a queen.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.203
TYWIN: Yes, but why?

11:46.200 --> 11:48.965
To further the family line.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.208
- Do you know how that happens?
- TOMMEN: Yes.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.966
TYWIN: But has anyone
explained the details to you?

11:56.040 --> 11:57.610
TOMMEN: I don't think so.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.445
It's all relatively straightforward.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.651
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.529
You are. You will be.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.609
I'll see to that.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.122
Please give the Queen
a moment alone with her son.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.521
- Yes, my lord.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.290

I'm sorry. You're lovely,
I just never acquired the taste.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.368
You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?

- Everyone has a preference.

I did. This is why I know.

Your hatred for my family

You arrive at the capital,

- What did you discuss?
- You think we conspired together?

35:32.240 --> 35:33.605

Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.561
Should I be concerned?

35:49.640 --> 35:53.087
You are unarmed and unguarded
because you know me better than that.

If I cut your throat today,
I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.

Men at war commit all kinds of crimes
without their superiors' knowledge.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.604
Categorically.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.041
I would like to speak with the Mountain.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.601
I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.

He might not enjoy it
as much as he thinks he would.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.849
I would like you to be the third.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.765
Why?

36:50.840 --> 36:54.640
Not long ago,
the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.405
Declared themselves enemies of the throne.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.562

Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.

37:02.240 --> 37:05.449
Asking me to judge at your son's trial
isn't quite as tempting.

to sit on the Small Council

- No one's seen her since the wedding.

than Sansa,

40:22.240 --> 40:24.242

wanted me to lose my head for it.

it makes me seem that much more guilty.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.489
before they reach an
army that can stop them.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.162
We need to shore up Castle Black

46:30.200 --> 46:32.601
and defend the Wall.

46:33.720 --> 46:35.882
That is our job.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.607
- We were held up.
- By what?

47:05.120 --> 47:06.121
Chains.

47:06.200 --> 47:09.807
We were guests of the mutineers
at Craster's Keep.

47:09.880 --> 47:12.531
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

47:12.640 --> 47:15.723
They've got Craster's food and his wives.

47:15.800 --> 47:19.361
DOLOROUS EDD: Poor girls.
Never thought they'd miss their daddy.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.084
Karl's running things now.

47:21.160 --> 47:23.640
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

47:23.720 --> 47:25.324
We need to ride north and kill them all.

47:25.400 --> 47:26.970
We just went over this, boy.

47:27.040 --> 47:29.520
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

47:31.600 --> 47:36.128
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

47:37.160 --> 47:39.527
Karl and the others know the truth
as well as we do.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.487
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

47:43.560 --> 47:46.564
when the wildlings are
peeling their fingernails off?

47:47.440 --> 47:50.683
Mance has all he needs to crush us,
he just doesn't know it yet.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.326
As soon as he gets his hands on them,
he will.

47:54.880 --> 47:56.769
Then he'll throw his full strength at us.

47:57.400 --> 48:00.210
And even if every one of us
kills 100 wildlings,

48:00.280 --> 48:02.886
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.481
I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.

50:06.920 --> 50:09.048
hides his cock in his own arsehole.

50:09.560 --> 50:12.086
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

50:12.160 --> 50:16.449
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

First, I will need this one to be quiet.

50:27.840 --> 50:28.841
Do I have a champion?

50:29.360 --> 50:32.364
Allow me this honour, Mother of Dragons.

I will not disappoint you.

50:35.240 --> 50:36.765
You are the commander of the Unsullied.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.805
I cannot risk you.

50:39.280 --> 50:42.648
Your Grace, I've won more single combats
than any man alive.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.927
Which is why you must remain by my side.

50:45.640 --> 50:48.928
I've been by your side
longer than any of them, Khaleesi.

Let me stand for you today as well.

You are my most trusted advisor,

Let me kill this man for you.

You have quite an audience.
