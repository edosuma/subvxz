WEBVTT

00:05.509 --> 00:09.036
Hey, Donna, now that we have our
wedding rings and you can't back out,

00:09.090 --> 00:11.495
I have something that I want to confess.

00:12.825 --> 00:15.344
I want to do the bunny hop at our wedding.

00:16.528 --> 00:19.738
I'm good at it, and I don't get
to show it off that often.

00:20.544 --> 00:21.234
Okay,

00:21.503 --> 00:25.389
but I want to walk into the reception
under an archway of cupcakes.

00:25.708 --> 00:27.656
Ooh, deal.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.228
Don't look! Turn away!

00:31.294 --> 00:33.176
Whoa. What? What? Oh.

00:33.252 --> 00:35.307
Did you get me a present?

00:36.210 --> 00:38.683
Is it bongo drums?

00:40.282 --> 00:44.025
No. I don't want you to see
my wedding dress. It's bad luck.

00:44.509 --> 00:48.253
Isn't having sex before
the wedding the bad luck thing?

00:49.037 --> 00:50.453
Well, that too.

00:50.553 --> 00:52.792
Eric, getting married
is like one big minefield.

00:52.885 --> 00:56.203
One false step, and limbs
just flying everywhere.

00:57.662 --> 01:00.975
Well, don't worry. I didn't see
your wedding dress, so...

01:02.141 --> 01:03.370
so

01:04.474 --> 01:09.058
I think we just saved ourselves some bad luck.
Now let's take that credit that we've earned

01:09.111 --> 01:11.153
and use it to have sex.

01:11.695 --> 01:15.153
Come on. We can't lose. It's gonna be
like playing with the house's money.

01:15.570 --> 01:18.861
Eric, if we broke our celibacy vow now,
what would it say about us?

01:18.924 --> 01:20.278
It would say,

01:20.382 --> 01:23.049
"yay! We had sex!"

01:23.799 --> 01:24.965
All right, fine.

01:25.049 --> 01:28.007
Can we look at our ring inscriptions,
or is that bad luck, too?

01:28.070 --> 01:32.320
Well, no, that I have to look at so I can return it
in case you wrote something stupid.

01:34.926 --> 01:36.551
"To eric,

01:36.634 --> 01:38.155
love donna."

01:41.843 --> 01:43.739
Well, it's not stupid.

01:44.316 --> 01:45.565
It's short.

01:47.523 --> 01:48.841
It's terse.

01:49.737 --> 01:52.403
Quite possibly even a little rude.

01:54.945 --> 01:58.819
"All my friends know the low rider."

02:04.215 --> 02:06.278
Um, I don't get it.

02:07.778 --> 02:10.318
Am I the low rider?

02:11.466 --> 02:14.924
Wait. What do you mean all your friends know me?
Are you saying I'm a whore?

02:15.632 --> 02:16.861
No, no, donna.

02:17.195 --> 02:20.862
"Low rider" is the song that was playing
in the car at the end of our first date.

02:20.945 --> 02:23.174
Remember, you wore that red dress,

02:23.237 --> 02:26.362
and at the end of the night, I kissed you,
and I remember thinking I just...you know,

02:26.980 --> 02:29.195
I just can't believe she's with me.

02:30.383 --> 02:33.716
Eric, that is the most romantic
thing I've ever heard.

02:34.570 --> 02:36.299
Take your pants off.

02:38.008 --> 02:40.633
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

03:22.665 --> 03:23.881
Fellas,

03:24.465 --> 03:27.565
I convinced donna to break her
celibacy vow,

03:27.624 --> 03:29.357
which in laymen's terms means...

03:30.477 --> 03:31.837
I'm a layman.

03:34.028 --> 03:36.841
Damn, forman, got your girlfriend
to have sex with you?

03:37.388 --> 03:39.081
What is your secret?

03:39.975 --> 03:44.206
Okay, you guys, it's a big deal. Have either
of you ever slept with my girlfriend?

03:45.422 --> 03:48.789
No, but I've done it with hyde's girlfriend.

03:50.205 --> 03:53.038
And I was good.

03:59.665 --> 04:01.798
Well, just what the heck is this?

04:04.082 --> 04:08.298
What a great auction! Red had
a few beers and bought a canoe.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.901
I bought a canoe!

04:14.101 --> 04:18.301
Who would've thought me and red go out
and he's the one to buy something stupid?

04:19.985 --> 04:21.918
I don't know where I'm gonna put this.

04:25.468 --> 04:27.151
Red, why would you buy a canoe?

04:27.201 --> 04:29.184
I think the question is...

04:29.251 --> 04:31.351
why haven't I before?

04:32.118 --> 04:33.568
But we can't afford this.

04:33.601 --> 04:34.651
Sure we can.

04:34.834 --> 04:37.117
I used the money that you
gave me yesterday.

04:37.201 --> 04:39.834
That was for eric's wedding present.

04:42.484 --> 04:44.201
Congratulations, eric.

04:46.801 --> 04:49.717
I knew you always wanted a canoe.

04:51.984 --> 04:52.834
Fine, red.

04:52.884 --> 04:58.601
Since you blew the money, I expect you to come up with
a nice sentimental gift for eric that doesn't cost anything.

04:58.634 --> 05:05.290
Well, that's what you get for going out and drinking. Maybe
one day you'll learn to stay at home and drink, like me.

05:08.790 --> 05:10.133
Hey, boys.

05:10.316 --> 05:11.878
I bought a canoe.

05:15.003 --> 05:17.822
Oh, hey, jackie. I just left my coat here

05:17.900 --> 05:19.983
after donna and I...

05:20.483 --> 05:23.800
well, I'm sure she already filled
you in on all the juicy details.

05:24.816 --> 05:28.150
Yeah, heard all about your little leg cramp.

05:32.135 --> 05:35.818
Hey, I can turn a leg cramp into magic!

05:36.701 --> 05:37.534
Ehh...

05:38.984 --> 05:40.718
she just doesn't get me.

05:43.668 --> 05:45.501
Oh, no, donna's wedding dress.

05:46.874 --> 05:47.874
Oh, no.

05:49.341 --> 05:51.207
Donna's wedding dress.

05:52.341 --> 05:54.307
Bad luck. Bad voodoo.

05:54.541 --> 05:56.407
Please. Give me a break.

06:03.957 --> 06:04.824
A well, boys,

06:05.774 --> 06:13.058
thanks to our time here in the circle, I've come up with a perfectly
rational way to keep donna from finding out that I tore her dress.

06:14.191 --> 06:16.358
I'm gonna destroy the earth.

06:18.191 --> 06:19.291
Okay,  well,

06:19.624 --> 06:22.008
first you gotta go to another planet

06:22.458 --> 06:26.838
and then you gotta build a giant
a death ray and aim it at the earth.

06:27.288 --> 06:28.905
That's pretty complicated.

06:30.805 --> 06:32.805
I can lend you my sketches if you want.

06:35.188 --> 06:36.543
That's a great plan.

06:37.276 --> 06:42.409
It's like so many of our ideas sound good in the circle,
but later on they just sound stupid.

06:43.326 --> 06:44.526
But a death ray...

06:45.633 --> 06:47.066
it's awesome.

06:51.383 --> 06:53.116
fez, stop smelling the dress.

06:53.199 --> 06:57.266
Hey, either I do this now, or I do it
at the reception. It's your choice.

07:04.887 --> 07:08.337
So mrs. Forman told me to get
this thing out of her sight.

07:08.954 --> 07:11.370
Now that could mean put it in the garage,

07:11.487 --> 07:13.387
leave it out for the garbageman.

07:13.954 --> 07:15.387
I like to think it meant,

07:15.537 --> 07:17.720
"hey, have a free canoe."

07:19.871 --> 07:23.104
And the three of us with a canoe,
we'll be unstoppable.

07:25.704 --> 07:27.104
What should we do with it?

07:28.138 --> 07:29.338
Let's see.

07:29.405 --> 07:32.605
What could we do with a canoe
that would make people say,

07:32.738 --> 07:35.405
"oh, no, what's wrong with them?"

07:37.155 --> 07:38.855
Oh! Oh!

07:41.655 --> 07:45.771
I know what we could do today
that's gonna be really fun.

07:46.505 --> 07:49.938
Kelso, the last time you said that,
we had to get your stomach pumped.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.455
I'm in.

08:02.655 --> 08:04.022
Hey, so, uh,

08:04.472 --> 08:07.239
how do you plan on steering
this thing on land?

08:09.255 --> 08:10.239
Duh.

08:13.888 --> 08:17.385
Kelso, I think you should wear a helmet
just in case anything goes wrong.

08:17.988 --> 08:18.805
Fez,

08:19.172 --> 08:23.955
I'm riding an open canoe down a rocky mountainside.
What could possibly go wrong?

08:26.605 --> 08:28.738
I think I'm with fez on this helmet thing.

08:28.955 --> 08:30.388
Oh, no,

08:30.455 --> 08:32.837
I'm not falling for that one.

08:33.688 --> 08:34.671
Falling for what?

08:34.721 --> 08:37.238
The old helmet gag.

08:38.705 --> 08:39.471
Kelso,

08:39.621 --> 08:43.005
I just want you to protect your head
from being crushed like a berry.

08:44.704 --> 08:46.604
Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

08:49.302 --> 08:53.302
Now let go of the ropes and watch me fly!

08:55.252 --> 08:57.497
1, 2, 3.

08:57.548 --> 08:59.493
Whoo-hoo!

09:03.253 --> 09:04.956
Whoo-hoo!

09:08.920 --> 09:11.003
Oh, man.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.753
Stupid thing.

09:22.808 --> 09:26.241
oh, man, that.. that could've been me!

09:31.871 --> 09:34.421
I don't get it. Who's "the low rider"?

09:36.604 --> 09:37.838
That's me.

09:37.954 --> 09:40.604
Then I think he's calling you a whore.

09:42.904 --> 09:44.754
Oh, my god! My dress!

09:45.004 --> 09:47.754
Yeah, doesn't look so good
in daylight, does it?

09:49.073 --> 09:52.404
No, it's gone. Did you move it?

09:52.463 --> 09:53.813
I didn't touch it.

09:53.917 --> 09:56.584
Oh, eric was here earlier. Maybe
he did something with it.

09:56.646 --> 09:59.063
Why are you always blaming eric
for everything?

09:59.125 --> 10:03.334
Oh, well, somebody has to, or he'll just go
through life thinking there's nothing wrong

10:12.033 --> 10:15.575
I know what I could give eric
that's sentimental..

10:15.634 --> 10:17.951
my old baseball glove.

10:19.684 --> 10:25.667
Red, anything related to sports will only remind eric
of the things he doesn't do well.

10:26.267 --> 10:31.683
Oh, fine. I'll just go down to the space toy
and smart mouth store.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.184
psst! Mom.

10:37.034 --> 10:38.917
Mom, is donna here?

10:38.984 --> 10:41.317
no. Why are we whispering?

10:44.117 --> 10:46.767
you tore her dress?

10:46.817 --> 10:49.917
Yeah, see, that would have been
a really good thing to whisper!

10:52.301 --> 10:56.248
All right, well, it doesn't look too bad. I think I can fix it.
Put it down. I'll get my sewing box.

10:56.298 --> 10:57.632
Mom, thank you.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.948
Not on the shoe polish!

11:05.848 --> 11:08.531
What have you done, you bony bastards?!

11:11.231 --> 11:12.865
Okay, okay.

11:12.931 --> 11:14.914
I think I can clean it, but we have to act fast.

11:14.981 --> 11:17.158
- Okay, go, go, go, go.
- Go, go, go

11:23.898 --> 11:27.614
please tell me that sound was a rip
in the space-time continuum.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.750
okay, I'm gonna need some club soda,
a little lemon juice and some vodka.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.433
To get the stain out?
No, to think straight.

11:43.633 --> 11:44.450
eric!

11:45.250 --> 11:46.167
Oh, my god.

11:47.483 --> 11:49.700
Oh, my god. Donna's coming.

11:52.383 --> 11:53.683
Have you seen my wedding dress?

11:53.733 --> 11:56.383
Whoa. You lost the wedding dress?

11:58.333 --> 12:00.966
What happens when we have a kid?
You gonna lose that, too?

12:02.300 --> 12:04.717
Oh, my god. I'll find it.
Don't worry. I'll find it.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.000
Okay.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.867
What is the matter with you?

12:08.900 --> 12:10.633
You just made her feel terrible.

12:10.683 --> 12:13.767
I was nervous. You know
I don't know when to shut up.

12:21.850 --> 12:23.200
What the hell is that?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.083
You know,

12:26.916 --> 12:28.933
there is gonna be a time when you

12:29.016 --> 12:32.049
look back on this, and you're
gonna think it's funny.

12:33.216 --> 12:36.533
You're gonna be single 'cause
donna will never marry you, but

12:36.949 --> 12:39.099
you're gonna think it's funny.

12:44.618 --> 12:46.485
We'll get a running start.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.601
And then I'll jump in

12:49.635 --> 12:53.268
and zoom down the hill like the bobsledders do.

12:53.668 --> 12:57.718
And then because this is a canoe on dirt
and gravel instead of a bobsled on ice,

12:57.768 --> 12:59.837
bad things are gonna happen to you.

13:00.251 --> 13:02.785
This is why I'm a legend fez.

13:03.635 --> 13:04.827
All right, kelso,

13:05.177 --> 13:07.827
this time you're wearing a helmet.

13:07.910 --> 13:13.293
Thanks, hyde, but I think I'm not gonna put on a helmet
with a bunch of worms and stuff crammed inside.

13:13.860 --> 13:14.993
It's not a prank.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.693
Well, now it's not 'cause I didn't fall for it.

13:18.620 --> 13:19.654
It finally happened.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.070
I've become the boy who cried helmet.

13:22.737 --> 13:23.737
Okay,

13:24.587 --> 13:25.637
on three.

13:26.420 --> 13:27.437
Go!

13:29.143 --> 13:30.756
Whoo-hoo!

13:35.203 --> 13:39.061
holy crap! Did you see me
bounce off of that tree?

13:40.977 --> 13:41.777
Honey,

13:41.977 --> 13:45.711
what is taking so long? I told you to put
the dress in the wash for 20 minutes.

13:45.761 --> 13:47.844
Yeah, and now it's in the dryer.

13:48.094 --> 13:51.061
Oh, no, please tell me you just put it in.

14:09.527 --> 14:10.581
Okay,

14:10.668 --> 14:11.518
okay.

14:13.618 --> 14:15.685
Let's look on the bright side.

14:17.542 --> 14:21.225
Maybe gray is a more honest color for donna.

14:27.759 --> 14:28.526
Hi.

14:29.792 --> 14:30.876
Um, fez,

14:31.876 --> 14:33.359
I know how you...

14:34.726 --> 14:36.676
how do I say this? Um..

14:36.976 --> 14:40.526
I know you sometimes like
to hang out in my closet.

14:42.876 --> 14:44.609
Yes, and...

14:48.415 --> 14:51.027
do you know what happened
to my wedding dress?

14:51.432 --> 14:52.515
Uh...

14:53.082 --> 14:55.065
I have to go to the bathroom.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.132
Eric, donna wants to know
what happened to her dress.

15:04.516 --> 15:06.432
Oh, tell her you took it.

15:06.499 --> 15:07.596
She'll kill me.

15:07.660 --> 15:09.057
She'll kill me more.

15:09.110 --> 15:10.644
Fine, fine.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.671
But at your wedding,
I want my own dance solo.

15:14.464 --> 15:14.890
Yeah,

15:15.397 --> 15:16.810
absolutely. Anything you want.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.405
With my own spotlight.

15:19.304 --> 15:19.877
Fine.

15:19.917 --> 15:22.050
- And a mention in the program.
- Fine!

15:22.944 --> 15:27.210
Look, but if you don't get upstairs, there will be no wedding,
which means there will be no dance solo.

15:27.477 --> 15:29.197
Oh, there will be a dance solo.

15:37.011 --> 15:38.558
I took it.

15:40.545 --> 15:41.785
Why?

15:42.278 --> 15:45.225
Uh, I forgot to go to the bathroom.

15:50.614 --> 15:52.694
She wants to know why.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.681
Because you're a pervert.

15:57.525 --> 15:58.498
Hey!

16:00.045 --> 16:01.232
No wait. That's true.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.341
I don't even have to lie.

16:10.288 --> 16:11.941
Because I'm a pervert.

16:16.381 --> 16:19.314
Fez, I'm gonna kick your ass!

16:20.594 --> 16:21.768
Eric!

16:28.950 --> 16:32.403
Oh, my god. What happened to my dress?

16:32.457 --> 16:34.390
Donna, I can explain.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.617
I destroyed it.

16:46.299 --> 16:49.072
You think maybe we're getting too old
for this kind of thing?

16:50.979 --> 16:54.737
No, you can't control the timing of when
a canoe is gonna come into your life.

16:55.412 --> 16:58.012
This is a horrible stunt.
You're gonna get hurt.

16:58.062 --> 17:01.645
No, no, I'm driving the car.
Kelso will be in the canoe.

17:01.712 --> 17:03.962
Oh, okay, have fun.

17:04.395 --> 17:07.012
All right, kelso, listen.
You gotta wear the helmet, all right?

17:07.078 --> 17:08.877
Yeah, protect that face.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.862
That's your money.

17:11.994 --> 17:13.928
No, I don't want to.

17:13.964 --> 17:15.329
Kelso,

17:15.744 --> 17:19.162
you're not pulling out of this driveway
until you put on a helmet.

17:19.362 --> 17:21.811
Fine. Everyone's against me.

17:29.591 --> 17:32.474
let the sparks fly!

17:35.200 --> 17:36.917
Whoo!

17:39.067 --> 17:41.750
Look at that crazy bastard.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.467
He may not be smart,

17:43.517 --> 17:46.500
but he has more fun than all
of us combined.

17:46.750 --> 17:49.750
Look, we had a guy like him
in the national guard.

17:50.067 --> 17:51.234
Yeah, what happened to him?

17:51.400 --> 17:53.500
Invented the wiffle ball.

17:54.084 --> 17:56.217
yeaaaah!

17:59.084 --> 18:00.317
donna, what happened?

18:00.351 --> 18:04.001
It's ruined. My dress is ruined.
What am I gonna do?

18:04.067 --> 18:07.734
It's okay, honey.I'll find you
a new dress... a better dress.

18:07.801 --> 18:12.084
this is my greatest achievement ever!

18:13.634 --> 18:15.551
Dad, I love this dress.

18:15.618 --> 18:18.534
Some random thing off the rack
just won't be the same.

18:18.595 --> 18:20.195
the rope broke!

18:20.245 --> 18:22.062
Runaway canoe!

18:28.359 --> 18:30.059
yes!

18:32.509 --> 18:35.076
Oh, no, donna,
I think I ripped your dress.

18:41.499 --> 18:44.099
Kitty, I think I've got it this time.

18:44.165 --> 18:46.465
For my wedding present for eric,

18:47.282 --> 18:49.699
one of my medals from the war.

18:51.165 --> 18:51.849
No.

18:53.282 --> 18:55.549
- How about my uniform from the war?
- No.

18:56.648 --> 18:58.940
- My gun from the war?
- No.

18:59.032 --> 19:00.865
- My boots from the war?
- No.

19:00.932 --> 19:03.115
- My canteen from the war?
- No.

19:03.508 --> 19:08.597
It can't be anything you had on or near you
when you killed somebody.

19:10.365 --> 19:11.898
How about the ring my dad wore?

19:11.932 --> 19:13.432
Oh, that's nice.

19:13.465 --> 19:16.032
When he killed people in world war I.

19:17.015 --> 19:19.398
Well, now you're just trying to make me mad.

19:19.632 --> 19:20.715
Yeah, I am.

19:23.832 --> 19:26.865
Look, donna, I'm so sorry about
what happened.

19:26.949 --> 19:30.366
Well, what I don't get is after
the second rip and the first stain,

19:30.399 --> 19:32.882
why you didn't just put the dress away.

19:33.532 --> 19:34.166
Hmm.

19:34.649 --> 19:37.032
Well, at that point, it had become personal.

19:37.699 --> 19:39.999
It was me against the dress, and,

19:40.065 --> 19:42.565
well, I was damned if I was
gonna let the dress win.

19:43.089 --> 19:46.715
You know, I knew we shouldn't have broken
our no-sex rule. We completely cursed ourselves.

19:46.748 --> 19:49.932
Okay, enough of this voodoo nonsense.

19:50.082 --> 19:51.798
Bad things happen

19:51.865 --> 19:54.115
because I am stupid.

19:56.082 --> 19:58.665
You're marrying a stupid guy, donna.
Good luck with me.

20:01.565 --> 20:03.065
Here, sweetie.

20:03.549 --> 20:04.182
For you.

20:04.232 --> 20:06.049
What's this?

20:09.732 --> 20:11.815
Mom's wedding dress?

20:12.682 --> 20:13.449
Yeah.

20:13.725 --> 20:17.041
Swallowed a little pride and called
to ask her if it would be okay.

20:17.091 --> 20:19.391
Yeah, but you guys haven't
talked in, like, a year.

20:19.441 --> 20:20.958
It was a little awkward,

20:21.122 --> 20:23.939
especially when I said, "it's Bob."

20:26.289 --> 20:28.556
And she said, "Bob who?"

20:32.339 --> 20:33.272
I love it.

20:33.656 --> 20:34.789
Hey,

20:35.139 --> 20:36.656
looks like we kinda saved the day.

20:36.689 --> 20:37.723
- Don't touch me.
- Okay.

20:37.773 --> 20:39.089
Thanks, daddy.

20:39.289 --> 20:41.639
Hey, anything for you, pumpkin.

20:41.956 --> 20:45.536
Plus, I need the room in the attic
for my stuffed bobcat.

20:46.853 --> 20:48.886
What was I thinking?

20:49.305 --> 20:55.253
