00:02.936 --> 00:05.330
I wish I could just move
beyond the damn theory.

00:05.331 --> 00:08.394
This is the idea I had been
missing to complete relativity.

00:08.395 --> 00:11.448
Acceleration and gravity
are the same thing.

00:11.449 --> 00:13.118
And an astronomer could prove it.

00:13.119 --> 00:14.527
I found you an astronomer.

00:14.528 --> 00:15.743
Name is Freundlich.

00:15.744 --> 00:17.568
I will never feel anything but

00:17.569 --> 00:19.169
love for you, Mileva.

00:19.170 --> 00:21.281
You had plenty to say
to that chesty brunette.

00:21.282 --> 00:23.559
I have never been unfaithful to you.

00:23.602 --> 00:25.421
Professor Haber, have
I ever mentioned that

00:25.422 --> 00:27.342
my cousin is Albert Einstein?

00:27.343 --> 00:29.097
Haber? He's legendary.

00:29.098 --> 00:31.242
Mileva makes life at home unbearable.

00:31.243 --> 00:33.451
Not every marriage is
meant to last forever.

00:33.452 --> 00:35.436
He's just the kind of man
we want in the academy.

00:35.437 --> 00:36.428
He's a dreamer.

00:36.429 --> 00:37.453
Not a rigorous scientist.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.894
It's an official offer.

00:38.895 --> 00:39.854
The Prussian Academy.

00:39.855 --> 00:41.230
I don't know if I can accept.

00:41.231 --> 00:43.599
I can't go to Berlin without an answer.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.680
I can't move to Berlin, Elsa.

00:45.681 --> 00:47.282
There are other people to consider.

00:47.283 --> 00:48.786
Most importantly, my sons.

00:48.787 --> 00:51.187
It would only be because
I want to be with you.

00:51.188 --> 00:54.264
Is that so terrible?

01:27.909 --> 01:31.878
Of all the planets and
stars there is only one

01:31.879 --> 01:36.421
Venus, named for the
goddess of beauty and love.

01:38.698 --> 01:43.115
Erwin Freundlich, are you
attempting to seduce me?

01:43.116 --> 01:46.253
I'm merely pointing out that we are

01:46.254 --> 01:50.803
in the ideal position to observe Venus.

01:51.824 --> 01:56.786
On Venus day, in fact,
which was later named Friday,

01:56.787 --> 02:01.299
in honor of Frigg, the wife of Odin.

02:01.300 --> 02:03.549
I'm quite certain you
didn't bring me all the way

02:03.550 --> 02:06.330
out here for a lesson in Norse mythology.

02:06.903 --> 02:07.991
I, uh.

02:07.992 --> 02:10.555
You what?

02:15.259 --> 02:19.868
Kate Hirschber, will you do me the honor

02:19.869 --> 02:22.045
of being my wife?

02:22.046 --> 02:23.650
Yes.

02:31.298 --> 02:34.754
That is, uh, quite fortunate.

02:34.755 --> 02:39.241
Because I have already made arrangements

02:40.486 --> 02:42.250
how does Zurich sound?

02:44.488 --> 02:47.752
It's an honor to meet
you, Professor Haber.

02:47.753 --> 02:49.898
Erwin and I are hoping to recruit you

02:49.899 --> 02:52.075
as an ally in our mission.

02:52.076 --> 02:53.259
Mission?

02:53.260 --> 02:55.264
You make it sound as
though you're going to war.

02:55.265 --> 02:56.173
Aren't I?

02:56.174 --> 02:58.862
You know the vitriol
that's been aimed at me.

02:58.863 --> 03:01.519
That tends to happen when
you make radical claims

03:01.520 --> 03:04.469
such as "gravity bends light."

03:05.041 --> 03:06.642
You've ruffled quite a few feathers.

03:06.643 --> 03:08.563
And we intend to unruffle them.

03:08.564 --> 03:11.956
By offering up something
that the critics can't

03:11.957 --> 03:13.684
argue against, proof.

03:13.685 --> 03:16.438
In the form of astronomical photographs.

03:16.439 --> 03:20.760
Consider Mercury, the
closest planet to the sun.

03:20.761 --> 03:23.513
Unlike the other seven
planets, Mercury's orbit

03:23.514 --> 03:25.882
doesn't conform to Newtonian laws.

03:25.883 --> 03:27.003
It's off.

03:27.004 --> 03:30.236
Le Verrier proposed that
Mercury's path is affected by

03:30.237 --> 03:33.341
the pull of a yet undiscovered planet,

03:33.342 --> 03:34.878
a planet he named Vulcan.

03:34.879 --> 03:36.320
There is no Vulcan.

03:36.321 --> 03:38.171
Then how do you explain
the anomalous orbit?

03:38.172 --> 03:41.410
Picture, if you will,
the vastness of space,

03:41.411 --> 03:46.724
and through it, a framework of
invisible lines like wire mesh

03:46.725 --> 03:48.933
supporting a pillar of concrete.

03:48.934 --> 03:55.304
Yet unlike rigid wire,
this grid work is curved,

03:55.305 --> 03:59.146
like fabric around any object of mass.

03:59.147 --> 04:01.227
Which causes Mercury's orbit

04:01.228 --> 04:03.019
to change each cycle.

04:03.020 --> 04:04.332
Extraordinary.

04:04.333 --> 04:07.054
I believe that this
same effect occurs when

04:07.055 --> 04:09.998
starlight passes by the sun.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.432
But the only way to confirm this theory

04:12.433 --> 04:14.609
is during a solar eclipse.

04:14.610 --> 04:16.853
Why an eclipse?

04:29.016 --> 04:30.776
Can you see the smaller stars?

04:30.777 --> 04:32.249
No.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.650
But if we block out
the light from the sun,

04:34.651 --> 04:36.699
you can see them more clearly.

04:36.700 --> 04:40.669
During an eclipse, Erwin can
photograph the position of

04:40.670 --> 04:45.119
stars in the daytime sky, and
we can compare them to their

04:45.120 --> 04:47.168
position in the night sky.

04:47.169 --> 04:48.576
Thus proving.

04:48.577 --> 04:51.938
The sun's gravity bends starlight.

04:51.939 --> 04:53.283
Clever, indeed.

04:53.284 --> 04:55.684
Fortunately, for us, just
such an eclipse occurs

04:55.685 --> 04:57.220
in a few months' time.

04:57.221 --> 04:59.237
And the ideal position to photograph the

04:59.238 --> 05:02.407
fullest point of that
eclipse is in Crimea.

05:02.408 --> 05:04.583
Russia?

05:04.584 --> 05:06.281
Such an expedition would cost.

05:06.282 --> 05:09.258
6,000 marks, give or take.

05:09.259 --> 05:10.666
An extravagant sum.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.972
Which surely the illustrious

05:12.973 --> 05:14.256
Prussian Academy can afford.

05:14.413 --> 05:18.062
And you expect me to convince them?

05:18.063 --> 05:20.303
Well, I'll make the
proposal, but a few good words

05:20.304 --> 05:23.760
from you in advance could
help settle the matter.

05:23.761 --> 05:27.698
Albert, your idea, it's astounding.

05:27.699 --> 05:29.844
But I fear the wheels of the
academy don't turn as fast

05:29.845 --> 05:30.996
as your nimble mind.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.596
These things take time.

05:32.597 --> 05:33.750
We don't have time.

05:33.751 --> 05:36.827
There won't be another eclipse for years.

05:37.720 --> 05:41.369
Well, then, I suppose
you'd better come to Berlin

05:41.370 --> 05:43.674
as soon as possible.

05:43.675 --> 05:45.178
Of course.

05:45.179 --> 05:49.088
I just have to settle a
few family matters first.

05:49.981 --> 05:51.613
I suppose I should be
cross with Erwin for not

05:51.614 --> 05:54.111
telling me the real reason
he wanted to come to Zürich.

05:54.112 --> 05:55.743
And why didn't he?

05:55.744 --> 05:58.049
I imagine he thought
I'd object to his working

05:58.050 --> 05:59.649
during our honeymoon.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.955
And having a complete
stranger foisted upon

06:01.956 --> 06:03.299
you as hostess?

06:03.300 --> 06:04.099
I'm sorry.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.380
If it's an imposition.

06:05.381 --> 06:07.301
No, I'm simply saying
it's hardly the honeymoon

06:07.302 --> 06:08.933
a bride dreams of.

06:08.934 --> 06:10.470
It's a small concession, really.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.615
The price we pay for being
married to men with brilliant

06:12.616 --> 06:16.521
minds, don't you think?

06:16.522 --> 06:21.387
I think you should expect
honesty in a husband.

06:21.388 --> 06:25.360
Men all have their secrets, don't they?

06:28.655 --> 06:30.704
Are you looking forward to Berlin?

06:30.705 --> 06:31.696
Berlin?

06:31.697 --> 06:33.137
Why would you say that?

06:33.138 --> 06:34.097
I'm sorry.

06:34.098 --> 06:36.854
Erwin mentioned that
you were moving there.

06:47.768 --> 06:49.912
Papa, papa.

06:49.913 --> 06:53.086
Ah.

06:53.851 --> 06:55.835
Eduard sank our boat in the pond.

06:55.836 --> 06:57.275
Well, then, we need to find a

06:57.276 --> 06:58.876
more reliable vessel.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.253
Why don't we build a kite?

07:00.254 --> 07:01.534
Yes, a kite.

07:01.535 --> 07:02.494
Go fetch your coats.

07:02.495 --> 07:04.836
We'll buy some materials.

07:14.821 --> 07:16.484
Berlin?

07:16.485 --> 07:19.366
Why didn't you tell me?

07:19.367 --> 07:20.870
I d-I didn't want to

07:20.871 --> 07:22.791
worry you before everything was arranged.

07:22.792 --> 07:24.712
I'm your wife.

07:24.713 --> 07:27.434
You didn't even think to consult me?

07:27.435 --> 07:29.322
It's the Prussian Academy, Mileva.

07:29.323 --> 07:31.628
You know what this means for our future.

07:31.629 --> 07:33.100
Are you really concerned with

07:33.101 --> 07:34.925
our future or yours?

07:34.926 --> 07:37.134
We just returned to Zürich.

07:37.135 --> 07:39.311
Because you were so miserable in Prague,

07:39.312 --> 07:40.752
but nothing changes.

07:40.753 --> 07:43.281
You're sullen and short
with me for reasons that

07:43.282 --> 07:44.433
I don't understand.

07:44.434 --> 07:46.931
How is it that you can
grasp the most intricate

07:46.932 --> 07:52.405
concepts in science, yet you
pretend not to understand me?

07:52.406 --> 07:54.774
We were to be partners, Albert.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.315
In everything.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.548
We're ready, papa.

08:03.387 --> 08:05.883
Now I'm not even
included in decisions that

08:05.884 --> 08:08.673
uproot our children.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.152
Trust me, Miza.

08:17.153 --> 08:19.846
This is for the best.

08:26.374 --> 08:28.902
Pictures alone won't appease my skeptics.

08:28.903 --> 08:31.751
The theory has to be
mathematically solid.

08:31.752 --> 08:32.744
It's not as if we've been

08:32.745 --> 08:34.727
sitting around here eating sausages.

08:34.729 --> 08:37.193
Though we have consumed
our share of schnitzel.

08:37.195 --> 08:38.986
Be serious, Marcel.

08:38.986 --> 08:42.284
I need proof in hand before
Freundlich departs for Crimea.

08:42.284 --> 08:45.261
It's the only way to rally
the academy behind me.

08:45.262 --> 08:47.630
Albert, since when are
you so concerned with

08:47.631 --> 08:51.092
the opinions of the
overstuffed establishment?

08:52.177 --> 08:58.964
You know, my father once told me physics

08:58.965 --> 09:03.062
is not a vocation.

09:03.063 --> 09:05.399
And he was right.

09:05.400 --> 09:09.308
For me, it's everything.

09:10.266 --> 09:14.654
And general relativity is.

09:15.324 --> 09:18.781
Well, it's the most
beautiful idea I've ever had.

09:18.782 --> 09:22.046
The culmination of all my
hours daydreaming as a boy,

09:22.047 --> 09:27.873
all, all the years of study, of
battling those who doubted me.

09:27.874 --> 09:30.819
I want the world to see,
finally, what I see and

09:30.820 --> 09:34.568
marvel at the magnificence
of what God has created.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.702
Well, if you want to
make them marvel at the

09:37.703 --> 09:41.575
magnificence, perhaps you
shouldn't rush off to Berlin

09:41.576 --> 09:43.848
before our work here is done.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.321
Hmm?

09:45.322 --> 09:49.803
Why are you suddenly in such
a hurry to return to a country

09:49.804 --> 09:52.305
whose citizenship you have renounced?

09:57.673 --> 10:00.458
I counted the hours, Albert.

10:00.459 --> 10:03.787
And now, finally, here you are.

10:03.788 --> 10:05.836
You made it all happen, Elsa.

10:05.837 --> 10:08.910
Oh, I wish you could spend the night.

10:08.911 --> 10:12.783
It would be so lovely to make
you breakfast in the morning.

10:12.784 --> 10:18.194
With you, it's all sunshine.

10:18.195 --> 10:22.196
At home, a cloud of anger.

10:22.197 --> 10:24.116
You should know.

10:24.117 --> 10:26.102
Clara Haber has invited
the girls and me to dinner

10:26.103 --> 10:27.546
with your family.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.135
You cannot accept.

10:30.136 --> 10:33.209
Albert, Clara is a keen woman.

10:33.210 --> 10:36.702
Refusing her invitation
would only arouse suspicion.

10:42.270 --> 10:44.702
And, so, how are you finding Berlin?

10:44.703 --> 10:47.807
To be quite honest, I miss Zürich.

10:47.808 --> 10:50.497
It was home.

10:50.498 --> 10:53.186
But you're originally
from Serbia, of course?

10:53.187 --> 10:55.138
Yes.

10:55.139 --> 10:56.355
I'm sure you read in the papers of

10:56.356 --> 10:57.860
the Archduke's assassination.

10:57.861 --> 10:59.045
Shocking news.

10:59.046 --> 11:01.542
They're saying it was
at the hands of a Serb,

11:01.543 --> 11:04.711
protesting Austria's
annexation of Bosnia.

11:04.712 --> 11:06.856
Do you think we'll
continue to see anarchy

11:06.857 --> 11:08.489
in the Slavic territories?

11:08.490 --> 11:10.697
In my opinion, Dr. Haber,
I imagine the Slavic

11:10.698 --> 11:13.964
nations will continue to
defend against anyone who

11:13.965 --> 11:16.268
views them as mere
"territories" to be acquired.

11:16.269 --> 11:17.517
Naturally, Mileva would

11:17.518 --> 11:18.989
never condone assassination.

11:18.990 --> 11:20.751
And yet I do understand the impulse

11:20.752 --> 11:22.447
to protect one's homeland against the

11:22.448 --> 11:24.048
aggression of imperialists.

11:24.049 --> 11:25.563
You cannot be suggesting that these

11:25.564 --> 11:26.654
rebels are justified.

11:26.655 --> 11:29.491
Fritz, surely a strong
patriotic spirit is a quality

11:29.492 --> 11:31.412
any good German can appreciate.

11:31.413 --> 11:33.076
Now, let us speak no more of politics.

11:33.077 --> 11:34.805
I've heard the opera has mounted a new

11:34.806 --> 11:36.342
production of Tosca.

11:36.343 --> 11:38.487
Mileva, do you enjoy Puccini?

11:38.488 --> 11:41.276
I do.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.042
Thank you.

11:46.043 --> 11:46.971
For what?

11:46.972 --> 11:49.148
For making me feel welcome.

11:49.149 --> 11:51.548
Think nothing of it.

11:51.549 --> 11:53.821
Albert's mother has always
been so critical of me.

11:53.822 --> 11:56.799
I fretted for days about
meeting more of the family.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.809
Oh, well, you must
put your fears to rest.

11:59.810 --> 12:01.185
You're very kind.

12:01.186 --> 12:03.110
It means a great deal to me.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.554
Herr Freundlich's expedition
will travel through

12:20.555 --> 12:23.532
Austria, crossing into Russia,

12:23.533 --> 12:26.189
arriving at the Crimean peninsula.

12:26.190 --> 12:29.678
There he will have
approximately two minutes to

12:29.679 --> 12:32.016
complete his observations
during the eclipse.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.264
And have you calculated the cost

12:33.265 --> 12:35.153
of this excursion?

12:35.154 --> 12:36.530
6,000 marks.

12:36.531 --> 12:40.083
Hmm, does that include caviar?

12:40.084 --> 12:42.900
I must assume my
esteemed colleagues of the

12:42.901 --> 12:46.006
academy see the value in
furthering new research rather

12:46.007 --> 12:49.175
than simply regurgitating the old.

12:49.176 --> 12:51.864
Old, as in the distinguished scholars

12:51.865 --> 12:54.714
sitting in this room?

12:54.715 --> 12:56.475
What I believe Professor
Einstein is trying

12:56.476 --> 12:59.516
to say is that his generalized
theory of relativity merits

12:59.517 --> 13:03.650
investigation, and financial
investment, as well.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.815
Would you mind giving us a few moments,

13:06.816 --> 13:08.869
Professor Einstein?

13:22.664 --> 13:24.167
Good afternoon, Madame.

13:24.168 --> 13:25.512
Please excuse the intrusion.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.009
My name is Vladimir Varicak,
and I've just traveled from.

13:28.010 --> 13:29.290
Zagreb.

13:29.291 --> 13:30.698
I hear it in your voice.

13:30.699 --> 13:32.395
Is it possible I have the good fortune to

13:32.396 --> 13:35.149
encounter a fellow Slav
here in the heart of Prussia?

13:35.150 --> 13:37.805
Is there a heart beating in Germany?

13:37.806 --> 13:39.407
I have yet to hear it.

13:39.408 --> 13:41.135
I don't suppose Professor
Einstein is at home?

13:41.136 --> 13:42.832
I'm afraid not, but I can direct you

13:42.833 --> 13:43.824
to the university.

13:43.825 --> 13:45.009
Well, yes.

13:45.010 --> 13:46.674
I had an appointment with
Professor Einstein at the

13:46.675 --> 13:51.447
university, but unfortunately,
he was not in attendance.

13:52.533 --> 13:55.893
You're more than welcome
to wait, if you like.

13:55.894 --> 13:57.591
He should be home shortly.

13:57.592 --> 13:59.420
Thank you.

14:01.113 --> 14:02.457
You can't seriously consider funding

14:02.458 --> 14:03.674
this charlatan, hmm?

14:03.675 --> 14:07.739
I admit Herr Einstein is
eccentric, but his theories

14:07.740 --> 14:09.693
are driven by the same curiosity that led

14:09.694 --> 14:11.421
Professor Planck to his
discoveries about quanta.

14:11.422 --> 14:14.206
The same thinking that led you
to your photoelectric effect.

14:14.207 --> 14:15.967
There is nothing about
Einstein that is the same

14:15.968 --> 14:17.536
as us, Professor Haber.

14:17.537 --> 14:19.008
Although I understand
your natural sympathies

14:19.009 --> 14:20.097
are with him.

14:20.098 --> 14:20.723
What do you mean by that?

14:20.724 --> 14:22.563
I think you know precisely what I mean.

14:22.564 --> 14:24.352
Has he promised you a
share of his profits?

14:24.353 --> 14:27.044
That will be enough, Philipp.

14:27.045 --> 14:29.798
Need I remind you both that
the kaiser's directive to

14:29.799 --> 14:32.807
the academy is to
further practical science,

14:32.808 --> 14:35.821
not uproot the very foundations
upon which it is built.

14:46.158 --> 14:48.238
Plum brandy?

14:48.239 --> 14:50.959
After all these years, a
glass of fermented prune juice

14:50.960 --> 14:52.304
is what you miss most?

14:52.305 --> 14:54.384
I miss almost everything about home,

14:54.385 --> 14:56.498
if you must know the truth.

14:56.499 --> 14:58.643
The smell of the spruce trees.

14:58.644 --> 15:00.851
The boats on Lake palic.

15:00.852 --> 15:02.709
And what about your family?

15:02.710 --> 15:05.910
My brother Milos has
enlisted in the army.

15:05.911 --> 15:07.511
I'm worried for him.

15:07.512 --> 15:09.816
Do you think it will come to war?

15:09.817 --> 15:11.801
Well, we both know the
spirit of a Serb is never

15:11.802 --> 15:14.558
to surrender to tyranny.

15:18.557 --> 15:20.701
Oh, good lord.

15:20.702 --> 15:21.949
I hadn't noticed the time.

15:21.950 --> 15:23.038
I.

15:23.039 --> 15:24.031
You must excuse me.

15:24.032 --> 15:25.983
I can't imagine what's kept Albert,

15:25.984 --> 15:29.377
but I apologize on his behalf.

15:29.378 --> 15:31.074
I'm staying at the Excelsior, should

15:31.075 --> 15:32.995
Professor Einstein
find time to reschedule.

15:32.996 --> 15:35.560
I'll be sure to tell him.

15:39.238 --> 15:40.582
At the risk of sounding forward,

15:40.583 --> 15:42.375
may I say I'm almost
thankful your husband

15:42.376 --> 15:45.517
was otherwise occupied.

15:51.756 --> 15:54.161
Good day, Frau Einstein.

16:02.418 --> 16:03.921
2,000 marks.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.713
Such a pittance won't
even get Freundlich to

16:05.714 --> 16:06.963
the Russian border.

16:06.964 --> 16:09.107
They're obviously trying
to deter me altogether.

16:09.108 --> 16:10.676
It's an insult.

16:10.677 --> 16:14.453
Perhaps I could introduce
you to Gustav Krupp.

16:14.454 --> 16:16.438
The industrialist?

16:16.439 --> 16:18.488
You think he would
pay for the expedition?

16:18.489 --> 16:20.728
He fancies himself an
intellectual, and he funds

16:20.729 --> 16:22.874
the Prussian Academy.

16:22.875 --> 16:25.983
Why not go directly to the source?

16:27.581 --> 16:29.053
Can you arrange a meeting?

16:29.054 --> 16:33.310
Only on the condition
that I accompany you.

16:33.311 --> 16:35.808
You can't bear to be away from me.

16:35.809 --> 16:40.674
True, but I also know
you're not always as adept at

16:40.675 --> 16:43.427
social niceties as
you are with equations.

16:43.428 --> 16:46.312
I can help iron the inevitable wrinkles.

16:47.078 --> 16:50.923
What would I do without you?

16:55.305 --> 16:56.425
Margot, dear.

16:56.426 --> 16:58.570
I was just congratulating
cousin Albert on his

16:58.571 --> 17:01.007
upcoming expedition.

17:07.855 --> 17:09.583
Where have you been?

17:09.584 --> 17:12.404
The academy.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.410
You had a visitor, a
mathematician with whom you

17:15.411 --> 17:16.530
broke an appointment.

17:16.531 --> 17:17.618
Varicak?

17:17.619 --> 17:18.740
He's of no consequence.

17:18.741 --> 17:20.180
He waited for hours.

17:20.181 --> 17:22.261
He writes almost weekly
trying to poke holes

17:22.262 --> 17:23.861
in my theory.

17:23.862 --> 17:26.230
I only agreed to the meeting
him to get him to stop.

17:26.231 --> 17:27.896
He traveled for hours.

17:27.896 --> 17:28.984
The least you...

17:28.985 --> 17:30.009
I'm afraid it will have to wait.

17:30.010 --> 17:31.032
I'm leaving tomorrow for Essen.

17:31.033 --> 17:32.409
I'll be gone several days.

17:32.410 --> 17:34.426
You're barely home as it is.

17:34.427 --> 17:38.205
Mileva, I have spent
the entire day defending

17:38.206 --> 17:39.997
myself to the academy.

17:39.998 --> 17:43.711
I will not be forced
to do it in my own home.

17:43.712 --> 17:47.136
I was under the
impression it was our home.

17:47.137 --> 17:51.651
Mileva, I am trying to
prove the most important

17:51.652 --> 17:53.155
discovery of my life.

17:53.156 --> 17:56.933
You of all people should
understand how important it is.

17:56.934 --> 17:58.789
I moved here with you, didn't I?

17:58.790 --> 18:00.006
Yet not one word of support since

18:00.007 --> 18:01.319
we set foot in Berlin.

18:01.320 --> 18:05.353
How am I to offer it
if you're never here?

18:05.354 --> 18:07.050
Can't you see how miserable I am?

18:07.051 --> 18:10.511
You're miserable everywhere.

18:11.788 --> 18:15.245
If you want to know the truth,
I'm looking forward to this

18:15.246 --> 18:19.347
trip, as I do any reprieve
from your dark moods.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.559
Well, what do you think?

18:37.560 --> 18:38.617
I.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.234
I think that your killing
machine is as magnificent

18:42.235 --> 18:44.763
a monstrosity as they come, Herr Krupp.

18:44.764 --> 18:46.555
I am going to present "big Bertha"

18:46.556 --> 18:48.028
to the reichstag next week.

18:48.029 --> 18:50.301
A fanciful name for such a weapon.

18:50.302 --> 18:52.895
I named her after the most combustible

18:52.896 --> 18:55.232
person I know.

18:55.233 --> 18:56.868
My wife.

18:58.466 --> 19:01.443
I must admit, Elsa.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.588
I was surprised to see you here.

19:03.589 --> 19:06.213
A bit of a precarious
position, is it not?

19:06.214 --> 19:07.814
Accompanying Professor Einstein on such

19:07.815 --> 19:09.862
a public errand?

19:09.863 --> 19:12.039
I can't imagine anyone
who would find fault

19:12.040 --> 19:13.704
in my supporting the endeavors of family.

19:13.705 --> 19:17.002
Yes, your cousin.

19:17.003 --> 19:19.371
I can assure you that rumors
remain at the speculation

19:19.372 --> 19:22.924
stage, yet I would tread carefully.

19:22.925 --> 19:25.678
A scandal once unleashed
is difficult to reign in and

19:25.679 --> 19:30.804
always ends up much worse
for the woman than the man.

19:31.249 --> 19:32.529
Thank you, Bertha.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.581
But I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.

19:38.388 --> 19:42.069
And so clearly the deflection
should be precisely.

19:42.070 --> 19:44.567
.83 seconds of arc.

19:44.568 --> 19:47.640
And to get here, we
employed riemannian geometry,

19:47.641 --> 19:49.849
since it contains certain
invariants under coordinate

19:49.850 --> 19:50.873
transformations that.

19:50.874 --> 19:52.474
And when these measurements are taken and

19:52.475 --> 19:55.452
photographs published, Albert
will be hailed a genius.

19:55.453 --> 19:57.980
Certainly in line for the Nobel prize.

19:57.981 --> 20:00.221
Elsa is perhaps too kind.

20:00.222 --> 20:02.399
Professor Einstein is perhaps too modest.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.703
His name will be forever
pressed into the history books

20:04.704 --> 20:07.169
for changing the way
we understand the world.

20:07.170 --> 20:10.211
The question is, does Herr
Gustav Krupp want his name

20:10.212 --> 20:12.584
printed alongside Albert's?

20:14.629 --> 20:17.638
As you know, I have many acquaintances

20:17.639 --> 20:19.303
in the academy.

20:19.304 --> 20:23.688
And there are those who
believe your theories to be,

20:23.689 --> 20:28.814
there's no polite way
to say it, pure fantasy.

20:30.156 --> 20:33.357
At the risk of sounding boastful,

20:33.358 --> 20:35.950
there are those who said I wouldn't prove

20:35.951 --> 20:38.223
the existence of molecules.

20:38.224 --> 20:41.104
They denounced my theory
of special relativity.

20:41.105 --> 20:44.370
If I'm right again, this
expedition will revolutionize

20:44.371 --> 20:47.347
science in the way that your big Bertha

20:47.348 --> 20:49.941
will revolutionize warfare.

20:49.942 --> 20:52.762
What do you say, Herr Krupp?

20:53.399 --> 20:57.884
I like a man who stands by
his dreams, Herr Einstein.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.298
The academy be damned.

21:02.299 --> 21:04.443
I must wire Freundlich immediately.

21:04.444 --> 21:06.652
I told you we could do it.

21:06.653 --> 21:08.477
You are my champion, Elsa.

21:08.478 --> 21:11.074
Thank you for believing in me.

21:13.441 --> 21:16.517
Albert, stop.

21:33.354 --> 21:34.921
What's wrong?

21:34.922 --> 21:36.842
You're becoming famous.

21:36.843 --> 21:38.603
You draw more attention
than an ordinary man

21:38.604 --> 21:39.820
kissing his mistress.

21:39.821 --> 21:42.157
Elsa, you are not my mistress.

21:42.158 --> 21:43.181
Are you not still married?

21:43.182 --> 21:44.845
I'm here with you.

21:44.846 --> 21:47.151
Look what we just accomplished together.

21:47.152 --> 21:48.880
You know what you mean to me.

21:48.881 --> 21:50.672
I do.

21:50.673 --> 21:53.586
But I'm beginning to see what
perhaps I should have all along.

21:53.587 --> 21:54.706
Elsa.

21:54.707 --> 21:56.627
I allowed myself to be
swept up in the whirlwind

21:56.628 --> 21:58.004
that you create.

21:58.005 --> 22:02.746
I was blinded by my feelings,
but Bertha has opened my eyes.

22:03.127 --> 22:04.823
We can't care what others say.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.360
We must.

22:06.361 --> 22:08.056
I need to think of my daughters.

22:08.057 --> 22:11.674
What happens to them if I
become the object of ridicule?

22:11.675 --> 22:13.595
What about your family?

22:13.596 --> 22:15.836
Mileva's furious with me regardless of.

22:15.837 --> 22:17.500
We've certainly given her reason.

22:17.501 --> 22:18.781
She doesn't know.

22:18.782 --> 22:21.439
Even so, she is not the
monster you made her out to be.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.936
Does she deserve the scorn
that will surely be heaped

22:23.937 --> 22:25.504
upon her if word spreads?

22:25.505 --> 22:26.721
Do your boys?

22:26.722 --> 22:30.146
Elsa, I moved my family
to Berlin for you.

22:30.147 --> 22:31.748
You came to join the academy.

22:31.749 --> 22:33.156
Because it brought me near to you.

22:33.157 --> 22:37.514
And now, now I can't imagine a
single day without seeing you.

22:38.983 --> 22:42.248
I'm sorry, Albert.

22:42.249 --> 22:43.981
But as long as you're still married,

22:43.982 --> 22:45.518
we cannot be together.

22:54.891 --> 22:57.325
I believe even Fritz
is secretly jealous of

22:57.326 --> 22:58.445
your husband's breakthrough.

22:58.446 --> 22:59.822
I am, too.

22:59.823 --> 23:04.337
I miss working with him,
being a scientist, myself.

23:04.338 --> 23:06.769
Yes, my years in the
laboratory with Fritz were

23:06.770 --> 23:08.722
among the best of my life.

23:08.723 --> 23:11.027
And now we are playing cards while

23:11.028 --> 23:14.169
they pursue their passions.

23:17.271 --> 23:19.031
Listen to the two of us.

23:19.032 --> 23:21.528
I do wish Elsa could have joined us.

23:21.529 --> 23:24.606
She brings such levity.

23:25.563 --> 23:26.811
I called on her
yesterday, but apparently,

23:26.812 --> 23:29.404
she's gone away for a few days.

23:29.405 --> 23:30.300
Where?

23:30.301 --> 23:31.709
To Essen, I'm told.

23:31.710 --> 23:32.733
Essen?

23:32.734 --> 23:35.490
That's where Albert is.

23:39.169 --> 23:41.025
Mileva.

23:41.026 --> 23:42.274
I'm sorry.

23:42.275 --> 23:44.482
I assumed you had some idea,

23:44.483 --> 23:46.340
or I would have spoken up sooner.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.897
How could I not have seen it?

23:51.527 --> 23:54.759
Perhaps you didn't want to.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.580
How long?

23:58.666 --> 24:01.418
If I'm not mistaken, it
was Elsa who helped make

24:01.419 --> 24:03.947
arrangements for your move.

24:03.948 --> 24:07.085
She was so kind to me.

24:07.086 --> 24:08.301
Elsa is not a bad woman.

24:08.302 --> 24:10.831
They rarely are.

24:10.832 --> 24:16.181
And you must find a
way to cope with that.

24:17.523 --> 24:19.510
As we all must.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.985
Fritz?

24:32.986 --> 24:34.490
Don't you want to kill him?

24:34.491 --> 24:36.671
I.

24:38.749 --> 24:42.686
You may rage in moral
superiority, as I did, you can

24:42.687 --> 24:48.673
sulk in futile silence, or you
might find it more satisfying

24:48.674 --> 24:51.974
to allow yourself the same freedom.

24:54.468 --> 24:55.715
I couldn't.

24:55.716 --> 24:58.569
Don't you deserve to feel loved?

25:09.483 --> 25:12.459
Frau Einstein.

25:12.460 --> 25:14.060
To what do I owe the pleasure?

25:14.061 --> 25:16.621
I came to inform you
that my husband has been

25:16.622 --> 25:18.926
called away on extended business.

25:18.927 --> 25:21.968
I'm afraid he won't be
able to meet with you.

25:21.969 --> 25:23.601
Disappointing news.

25:23.602 --> 25:27.543
Albert can be awfully
thoughtless sometimes.

25:27.955 --> 25:31.032
I felt you were owed
an apology in person.

25:31.349 --> 25:34.325
Well, it seems that
neither of us has a dinner

25:34.326 --> 25:37.462
companion this evening.

25:37.463 --> 25:41.116
Would you care to, to join me?

25:44.891 --> 25:47.612
They say Tesla is as
mad as he is brilliant.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.756
Perhaps that's simply a
persona he's created to

25:49.757 --> 25:51.325
distinguish himself
from the likes of Edison.

25:51.326 --> 25:53.598
Hmm, a fascinating theory.

25:53.599 --> 25:56.383
Then again, he is a
temperamental Serb, and

25:56.384 --> 26:00.133
there's nothing entirely
sane about the lot of us.

26:06.629 --> 26:08.069
I've had a wonderful time with you

26:08.070 --> 26:10.634
this evening, Mileva.

26:16.714 --> 26:20.138
I'm afraid I've taken leave
of my senses, dining in

26:20.139 --> 26:24.336
public with a stranger
while my husband is away.

26:25.710 --> 26:29.843
Stranger no more, I hope.

26:31.185 --> 26:33.364
Good evening.

26:51.962 --> 26:56.543
When were you going
to tell me about Elsa?

27:04.224 --> 27:07.812
Are you in love with her?

27:15.653 --> 27:17.544
I'm sorry.

27:18.630 --> 27:21.642
Do you know where I was last night?

27:23.368 --> 27:24.648
I have no idea.

27:24.649 --> 27:26.665
I went to a hotel.

27:26.666 --> 27:28.458
To meet a man.

27:28.459 --> 27:30.667
A man who finds me fascinating, who takes

27:30.668 --> 27:32.880
pleasure in my company.

27:33.389 --> 27:34.509
Who was he?

27:34.510 --> 27:38.643
The mathematician from
Zagreb, but I couldn't.

27:42.673 --> 27:45.334
Perhaps you should have.

27:51.381 --> 27:53.845
Do I really mean so little to you?

27:53.846 --> 27:54.870
Dollie.

27:54.871 --> 27:56.087
Do not call me that.

27:56.088 --> 27:57.527
Not unless you can look me in the eye and

27:57.528 --> 27:59.708
tell me you still love me.

28:01.050 --> 28:04.827
It's time we were honest with each other.

28:04.828 --> 28:08.864
Love has abandoned this
marriage in equal parts.

28:11.486 --> 28:16.031
What about the, the life we've built?

28:16.032 --> 28:20.514
There is no sin in
drifting apart, only in

28:20.515 --> 28:23.335
punishing each other for it.

28:27.334 --> 28:29.834
I want a divorce.

28:38.379 --> 28:39.659
She refused.

28:39.660 --> 28:41.996
Why are you so intent
on a divorce, anyway?

28:41.997 --> 28:43.788
Why not do what the rest of us do?

28:43.789 --> 28:45.357
Take a mistress.

28:45.358 --> 28:48.078
There's been no talk of
divorce under my roof.

28:48.079 --> 28:50.800
Elsa won't see me as things stand.

28:50.801 --> 28:53.809
She certainly won't resume
our relations as long as

28:53.810 --> 28:55.090
I'm still married.

28:55.091 --> 28:57.527
Elsa means that much to you?

28:57.908 --> 29:00.180
She looks after me.

29:00.181 --> 29:01.813
She believes in me.

29:01.814 --> 29:05.911
She, she makes me happy.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.472
Perhaps Mileva can find
someone to make her happy,

29:08.473 --> 29:12.044
too, but not as long as
she clings to this marriage.

29:12.045 --> 29:15.430
I must make her see that
somehow and set us both free.

29:15.431 --> 29:17.315
How do you plan to do that?

29:18.509 --> 29:20.720
"If you wish to remain
married, you must agree to

29:20.721 --> 29:23.031
the following conditions.

29:23.032 --> 29:26.207
You will ensure that my
laundry is kept in good order,

29:26.208 --> 29:28.710
that I receive three meals in
my room, and that my study is

29:28.711 --> 29:31.088
kept neat, left for my use only.

29:31.695 --> 29:35.255
You will renounce personal
relations with me insofar as

29:35.256 --> 29:37.726
they are not necessary
for social reasons.

29:37.727 --> 29:43.020
You will not expect any
intimacy from me, nor will you

29:43.021 --> 29:45.847
reproach me in any way."

29:46.775 --> 29:48.795
Has he gone mad?

29:48.796 --> 29:51.812
How could you agree to
be party to such a thing?

29:51.813 --> 29:54.570
You will stop talking to me

29:54.571 --> 29:56.720
when I request it.

29:56.721 --> 29:59.928
You will leave my bedroom
and study immediately and

29:59.929 --> 30:03.526
without protest if I request it."

30:09.491 --> 30:11.608
It's absurd.

30:11.609 --> 30:15.586
To honestly believe one's own
wife is so without reason that

30:15.587 --> 30:19.629
she must be shocked
into accepting a divorce?

30:19.630 --> 30:22.902
Not even the decency to
issue the demands himself.

30:22.903 --> 30:26.207
Such theatrics can only
be intended to incense me.

30:26.208 --> 30:27.779
He's given you no choice, Mileva.

30:27.780 --> 30:32.206
How can you retain any
dignity if you hold on?

30:32.207 --> 30:35.033
Give the man his damn
divorce and be done with it.

30:44.464 --> 30:47.836
I'll do what you want.

30:53.576 --> 30:57.971
I'm sure in time you'll realize

30:57.972 --> 30:59.350
it's for the best.

30:59.351 --> 31:02.270
Not the divorce.

31:02.271 --> 31:03.939
I mean your list.

31:03.940 --> 31:07.436
I'll wash your laundry, clean
each floorboard, deliver three

31:07.437 --> 31:09.554
hot meals to your study.

31:09.555 --> 31:10.644
Mileva.

31:10.645 --> 31:12.345
I'll respect the letter of the law in

31:12.346 --> 31:14.398
Albert Einstein's household.

31:14.399 --> 31:16.388
Those were your terms, were they not?

31:16.389 --> 31:19.371
Yes, if you are intent
on forcing us to remain

31:19.372 --> 31:22.324
in this intolerable situation.

31:22.325 --> 31:24.249
I am.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.078
For the boys.

31:26.079 --> 31:28.836
They need their father.

31:28.837 --> 31:30.890
I would be near, no matter what.

31:30.891 --> 31:33.072
You aren't near as it is.

31:33.073 --> 31:36.088
We both know if you move out,
weeks will go by without them

31:36.089 --> 31:37.499
laying eyes on the man they adore.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.521
Would that be worse
than growing up with two

31:39.522 --> 31:42.408
people who can't bear to be
in the same room as each other?

31:42.409 --> 31:47.029
I am not letting you
walk away from the boys.

31:47.030 --> 31:50.783
And yes, I am aware this
relationship henceforth

31:50.784 --> 31:55.535
is merely a formality.

31:55.982 --> 32:00.926
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must shop for your meals.

32:23.736 --> 32:27.168
You know what force makes the kite fly?

32:27.169 --> 32:32.205
It's called lift, a curious
effect of air passing over

32:32.206 --> 32:33.777
the kite's surface.

32:33.778 --> 32:37.054
Huh?

32:37.949 --> 32:39.938
What do you say we go
and get some cake, huh?

32:39.939 --> 32:41.221
Yes, please.

32:41.222 --> 32:42.312
All right.

32:42.313 --> 32:43.339
Let's bring her in.

32:43.340 --> 32:44.558
You know what, papa?

32:44.559 --> 32:48.123
I don't think you're nearly
as cruel as mama says you are.

32:56.430 --> 32:59.221
I hope you understand this was,

32:59.222 --> 33:04.455
what it was and nothing more.

33:05.959 --> 33:09.011
Perhaps in another time.

33:14.205 --> 33:17.513
Of course.

33:19.949 --> 33:23.381
Since it's clear I'm never
meeting with your esteemed

33:23.382 --> 33:27.074
husband, I hope you'll show this to him.

33:31.211 --> 33:33.905
I've devised a proof
which demonstrates that his

33:33.906 --> 33:38.076
theory does not satisfy mach's principle.

33:38.077 --> 33:39.295
Are you certain?

33:39.296 --> 33:40.867
I came to warn him that
if he proceeds with this

33:40.868 --> 33:44.814
expedition, he will be
testing a calculation based on

33:44.815 --> 33:46.066
a flawed foundation.

33:46.067 --> 33:49.309
His results will not
match his predictions.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.684
He could become a laughingstock.

34:03.905 --> 34:07.787
Albert, there's
something I must show you.

34:07.788 --> 34:09.679
How long have you been poisoning my

34:09.681 --> 34:11.668
sons against me?

34:11.670 --> 34:13.594
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:13.594 --> 34:15.937
They seem to think
that I'm a cruel person.

34:15.938 --> 34:18.022
I wonder where they got such an idea.

34:18.023 --> 34:21.359
Do you honestly believe
I need to conspire to

34:21.360 --> 34:24.664
make the boys see what they
witness with their own eyes?

34:24.665 --> 34:25.658
The way you treat me?

34:25.659 --> 34:26.621
You twist reality.

34:26.621 --> 34:28.385
But this stops now.

34:28.386 --> 34:30.118
You are never to speak
ill of me in front of

34:30.119 --> 34:32.496
the children again.

34:33.969 --> 34:37.304
I will add it to the list.

34:37.306 --> 34:39.295
You should look this
over before Freundlich.

34:39.295 --> 34:40.803
My patience is exhausted, Mileva.

34:40.804 --> 34:41.797
It's for your own.

34:41.797 --> 34:42.953
Item d.

34:42.954 --> 34:44.925
You will stop talking
to me when I request it,

34:44.926 --> 34:48.667
and you will leave my study
immediately without protest.

35:03.658 --> 35:06.578
Be sure to send a telegram the
moment you arrive in Crimea.

35:06.579 --> 35:07.848
Not to worry.

35:07.849 --> 35:09.045
By the end of the month,

35:09.046 --> 35:11.227
the world will be
cheering Albert Einstein.

35:11.228 --> 35:13.958
No one will ever doubt you again.

35:47.389 --> 35:50.178
The kaiser's declared war.

35:50.179 --> 35:52.650
On Serbia?

35:52.651 --> 35:54.799
No, sir.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.466
On Russia.

36:01.506 --> 36:03.687
We are officially across enemy lines.

36:03.688 --> 36:07.633
Keep your voices down.

36:07.634 --> 36:09.205
If we change trains at the next stop,

36:09.206 --> 36:10.681
we could be back into
Austria by nightfall.

36:10.682 --> 36:12.927
No, the worst thing we can do is panic.

36:12.928 --> 36:14.242
But Herr Freundlich.

36:14.243 --> 36:17.098
We only need to keep
quiet, make it to Crimea,

36:17.099 --> 36:20.407
take our photographs
and get the hell out.

37:31.472 --> 37:33.287
Has there been a
telegram from Freundlich?

37:33.288 --> 37:34.207
No.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.202
Are you sure?

37:35.203 --> 37:37.063
Is it possible that
you missed a messenger?

37:37.064 --> 37:39.405
I haven't left the apartment all day.

37:39.406 --> 37:41.847
There's been no telegram.

37:42.935 --> 37:44.767
What's happened?

37:52.882 --> 37:53.907
We are astronomers.

37:53.908 --> 37:55.575
You must believe me.

37:55.576 --> 37:57.276
We, tell him, tell him.

38:04.592 --> 38:06.281
Stars, the stars up.

38:06.282 --> 38:07.685
No, no, no, please, don't touch this.

38:07.686 --> 38:08.442
This does not.

38:18.967 --> 38:20.570
Thank you for coming.

38:20.571 --> 38:22.784
Your message sounded urgent.

38:22.785 --> 38:25.608
Gentlemen, I fear that
Herr Freundlich and

38:25.609 --> 38:27.789
his men have run into trouble in Russia.

38:27.790 --> 38:30.517
I haven't received word from
them since the war broke out.

38:30.518 --> 38:32.666
If you haven't heard from
them, you can't be sure

38:32.667 --> 38:33.789
there's a problem.

38:33.790 --> 38:35.683
His instructions were
to wire me the moment

38:35.684 --> 38:37.222
he arrived in Crimea.

38:37.223 --> 38:38.669
How do you expect us to find

38:38.670 --> 38:40.046
three astronomers in the middle of a war?

38:40.047 --> 38:41.715
Max, this is the kaiser's academy,

38:41.716 --> 38:43.062
for God's sake.

38:43.063 --> 38:45.853
Men of your stature must have
a connection at the reichstag.

38:45.854 --> 38:47.747
If we go to the reichstag,
they are likely to

38:47.748 --> 38:50.441
question the wisdom of your
insistence on embarking on

38:50.442 --> 38:51.917
this expedition at such a volatile time.

38:51.918 --> 38:53.361
Who cares what people think of me

38:53.362 --> 38:54.901
when lives are at stake?

38:54.902 --> 38:56.830
Just help me find Erwin.

39:07.929 --> 39:09.725
This is a camera, no?

39:09.726 --> 39:11.458
Yes, but.

39:11.459 --> 39:15.083
To take pictures of troop
movements, encampments.

39:15.084 --> 39:16.271
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

39:16.272 --> 39:17.618
nothing like that.

39:17.619 --> 39:20.505
You enter Russia from
Germany with trunks full of

39:20.506 --> 39:23.168
photographic devices,
and you want us to believe

39:23.169 --> 39:24.420
that you are not a spy?

39:24.421 --> 39:26.826
I, I'm a scientist.

39:26.827 --> 39:31.221
I'm here to photograph an
eclipse in a matter of days.

39:31.222 --> 39:34.366
Please, if you would
release me and my assistants,

39:34.367 --> 39:35.553
it's not too late.

39:35.554 --> 39:36.804
Who ordered you to come here?

39:36.805 --> 39:39.339
I-I'm here on behalf of

39:39.340 --> 39:42.327
the great physicist, Albert Einstein.

39:42.998 --> 39:45.660
You work for Albert Einstein?

39:45.661 --> 39:48.808
Yes, you know of him?

39:52.849 --> 39:53.698
Well?

39:53.699 --> 39:55.752
The kaiser has heard
through diplomatic channels.

39:55.753 --> 39:57.884
Freundlich is alive, as are his men.

39:57.885 --> 39:58.879
Wonderful news.

39:58.880 --> 40:00.194
In part.

40:00.195 --> 40:03.436
They're being interned
in a prisoner-of-war camp.

40:03.437 --> 40:04.751
On what grounds?

40:04.752 --> 40:06.034
Espionage.

40:06.035 --> 40:07.222
That's absurd.

40:07.223 --> 40:10.109
Albert, you sent him into
a war zone a trunk full

40:10.110 --> 40:11.842
of surveillance equipment.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.991
Well, let's clear up
the misunderstanding and

40:13.992 --> 40:15.307
get them out of there.

40:15.308 --> 40:17.232
It's not that simple.

40:17.233 --> 40:19.125
There may be a way to resolve this.

40:19.126 --> 40:21.788
But it requires the cooperation of both

40:21.789 --> 40:23.746
the kaiser and the czar.

40:23.747 --> 40:24.900
Whatever must be done.

40:24.901 --> 40:26.826
Albert, there is no guarantee that

40:26.827 --> 40:28.402
he's coming home.

41:05.906 --> 41:07.447
Where are you taking me?

41:29.297 --> 41:31.705
No, please, please, I have a wife.

41:37.574 --> 41:39.951
Go, go,.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.662
Move.

41:53.232 --> 41:57.245
Go, let's go, go, go.

42:17.424 --> 42:19.798
Mileva, Erwin's been freed in exchange

42:19.799 --> 42:21.562
for Russian prisoners.

42:21.563 --> 42:22.589
Thank God.

42:22.590 --> 42:23.615
I know.

42:23.616 --> 42:25.095
Isn't it wonderful?

42:28.750 --> 42:30.807
And the photographs?

42:34.494 --> 42:36.710
Perhaps it's a blessing.

42:38.408 --> 42:40.204
Why would you say that?

42:40.205 --> 42:45.726
Your foundation for general
relativity is flawed.

42:46.012 --> 42:47.198
What?

42:47.199 --> 42:50.154
Whatever would lead you
to such a conclusion?

42:57.370 --> 42:59.684
Herr Varicak.

42:59.938 --> 43:02.117
Naturally, I didn't believe
his ideas had merit, but then

43:02.118 --> 43:05.359
he showed me his proof, and
Albert, your theory does not,

43:05.360 --> 43:08.282
in fact, satisfy mach's principle.

43:08.825 --> 43:12.995
You saw this proof, and
yet you said nothing?

43:12.996 --> 43:15.277
I tried.

43:15.466 --> 43:19.541
You, you tried?

43:19.542 --> 43:21.926
Y-you're telling me that
I could have been ruined,

43:21.927 --> 43:23.466
and you stayed silent?

43:23.467 --> 43:27.288
I was obeying your orders.

43:29.146 --> 43:31.680
So out of spite you let me send those

43:31.681 --> 43:33.541
young men into danger?

43:33.542 --> 43:35.723
How were either of us
to know the kaiser would

43:35.724 --> 43:36.878
declare war on Russia?

43:36.879 --> 43:38.418
You wanted me to fail.

43:38.419 --> 43:41.085
Yes!

43:41.756 --> 43:45.413
Yes, somewhere deep within
me I wanted to see the look

43:45.414 --> 43:48.717
on your face when you
experienced real pain.

43:48.718 --> 43:50.450
Disappointment.

43:50.451 --> 43:52.310
The harsh judgement of the world.

43:52.311 --> 43:56.578
I wanted to see those
dreams crumble for you

43:56.579 --> 43:58.764
as they have for me.

44:04.215 --> 44:05.662
You hate me that much?

44:09.028 --> 44:12.624
I don't hate you.

44:13.520 --> 44:17.983
I hate the person I've
become because of you.

44:19.552 --> 44:23.277
You're right, Albert.

44:23.723 --> 44:26.260
We can't stay together any longer.

44:42.333 --> 44:43.423
Albert.

44:43.424 --> 44:44.481
I thought we decided.

44:44.482 --> 44:45.508
Mileva's agreed to end things.

44:45.509 --> 44:47.402
She accepted the divorce?

44:47.403 --> 44:48.653
Not entirely.

44:48.654 --> 44:49.584
A separation.

44:49.585 --> 44:50.770
Oh, Albert, that's not.

44:50.771 --> 44:51.572
It's a start.

44:51.573 --> 44:53.497
I'll be getting a flat of my own.

44:53.498 --> 44:55.583
We'll have all the time in the world.

44:55.584 --> 44:57.508
You know there is quite
a difference between

44:57.509 --> 44:59.273
separation and divorce.

44:59.274 --> 45:01.904
Can we please simply enjoy this moment?

45:01.905 --> 45:05.594
I know it's been difficult,
but I beg your patience just

45:05.595 --> 45:07.680
a little while longer.

45:07.681 --> 45:09.316
It's only a matter of
time before we're able

45:09.317 --> 45:10.856
to be together.

45:10.857 --> 45:12.368
Hm?

45:22.825 --> 45:24.624
Mileva?

45:27.638 --> 45:29.950
Boys, boys?

45:52.600 --> 45:53.818
Let's get our seats.

45:53.819 --> 45:57.251
Mileva, Mileva, Mileva, don't do this.

45:57.252 --> 45:58.663
It's already done, Albert.

45:58.664 --> 46:01.326
You don't have to go all
the way to Switzerland.

46:01.327 --> 46:02.898
It will be easier for everyone.

46:02.899 --> 46:03.893
You can't.

46:03.894 --> 46:07.037
You pushed so hard.

46:07.038 --> 46:08.449
Now you have what you wanted.

46:08.450 --> 46:10.246
I wanted to end our marriage.

46:10.247 --> 46:12.427
I didn't want to lose my whole family.

46:12.428 --> 46:14.994
The move to Berlin was for you.

46:14.995 --> 46:17.561
I never wanted it.

46:17.562 --> 46:20.577
But what about the boys?

46:20.578 --> 46:23.148
You can't have everything, Albert.

46:27.669 --> 46:29.080
You have your kite with you?

46:29.081 --> 46:31.486
Yes, papa.

46:31.487 --> 46:35.308
Good, I'll come and fly
it with you very soon.

46:37.454 --> 46:38.737
I'll write every day.

46:38.738 --> 46:39.956
Will you remember where

46:39.957 --> 46:41.560
we left off on circumference?

46:41.561 --> 46:43.971
I will.

46:45.412 --> 46:49.293
I'm sorry, Dollie.

46:49.294 --> 46:51.989
I wanted so much for us.

46:51.990 --> 46:53.725
Good-bye, Albert.
