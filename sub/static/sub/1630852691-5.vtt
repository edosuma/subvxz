00:27.125 --> 00:28.291
Who were you before?

00:28.375 --> 00:29.375
Nobody.

00:30.166 --> 00:31.875
-Don't you have a past?
-No.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.958
Everybody has some form of past.

00:35.041 --> 00:36.166
I don't.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.833
I don't need to know anyway.

00:38.916 --> 00:41.375
This is who you are now. Lykke Sundby.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.041
Lykke Sundby. That sounds nice.

00:45.583 --> 00:47.958
No matter who you were,
this is who you are now.

00:49.041 --> 00:49.875
And the child?

00:49.958 --> 00:51.083
This is Emma.

00:51.958 --> 00:54.208
-And she's yours?
-Of course.

00:54.791 --> 00:56.000
You're a single parent?

00:56.083 --> 00:58.916
You said you didn't need
to know all that stuff.

01:04.166 --> 01:05.166
Thank you.

01:25.541 --> 01:28.208
<i>This is Emma. Leave a message if you want.</i>

01:28.291 --> 01:30.500
Hey. Where are you?

01:31.416 --> 01:34.625
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Can we talk later?

01:35.375 --> 01:37.583
Bye. Bye, kisses.

01:51.708 --> 01:53.375
It was my teacher, Hans.

01:54.541 --> 01:56.083
He pushed it into my neck.

02:01.708 --> 02:03.250
Why do you think he chose me?

02:05.750 --> 02:07.208
Maybe it was coincidence.

02:10.083 --> 02:11.625
I was just an envelope.

02:13.875 --> 02:17.625
They want to hide the ball from me
because it leads to their spaceship.

02:20.291 --> 02:23.416
The ball reacted to the sphere
at the old sawmill.

02:25.125 --> 02:26.750
We have to go there.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.333
I just ran away from them.

02:29.875 --> 02:31.750
I need you to show me where it is.

02:56.250 --> 02:57.833
Why are they here?

02:59.083 --> 03:00.291
Why?

03:00.375 --> 03:02.333
Yes, why did they choose Earth?

03:02.916 --> 03:04.416
Because they think they can hide.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.000
Because they look like you.

03:10.583 --> 03:12.333
The two of us look like each other.

03:15.958 --> 03:17.208
I don't look like you.

03:18.625 --> 03:20.125
This is just how I appear.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.041
It was here.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.500
It's them.

03:44.791 --> 03:45.958
That's their spaceship.

03:46.541 --> 03:47.791
They moved it.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.083
He was here too.

03:50.375 --> 03:51.583
My teacher.

03:53.291 --> 03:54.750
-He was…
-Absorbed.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.333
Yes.

03:57.875 --> 04:00.208
Or dissolved.
I don't know how to phrase it.

04:04.666 --> 04:06.375
The ball's no longer connected.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.208
It's useless.

04:34.833 --> 04:35.875
Come on.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.250
How do we find them?

04:40.875 --> 04:42.958
-I don't know.
-Who knows, then?

04:43.791 --> 04:45.625
-This is your responsibility.
-Mine?

04:46.375 --> 04:48.500
-It's your fault they're gone.
-What could I have done?

04:48.583 --> 04:50.833
-Could've come to me.
-I hardly know who you are.

04:50.916 --> 04:51.833
I told you.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.250
You're hunting
an intergalactic terror organism

04:54.333 --> 04:56.916
that wants to conquer Earth. Sure.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.291
Sorry if I didn't immediately get that.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.750
That's irony.
Is that not a thing where you come from?

05:03.250 --> 05:04.833
My job is to find them.

05:05.625 --> 05:08.166
I need to know how many they are,
and where they are.

05:08.250 --> 05:11.000
-And I need to stop them.
-Because otherwise we all die.

05:12.333 --> 05:13.333
Yes.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.125
Why were you at your teacher's house?

05:26.458 --> 05:29.458
He was on a list of people
who were there the night they came.

05:30.875 --> 05:32.708
A list of those who came?

05:32.791 --> 05:33.875
Yes.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.208
Or not just that.
All kinds of people, I think.

05:36.291 --> 05:40.000
It's on an external hard drive.
Mads practically sleeps with it.

05:41.416 --> 05:42.916
I need that list.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.750
I can't get it.

05:45.458 --> 05:46.666
We had an argument.

06:00.791 --> 06:03.166
What about her? Have you talked to her?

06:03.791 --> 06:05.916
Yeah, I kind of like her.

06:06.458 --> 06:07.875
She seems sort of nice.

06:09.708 --> 06:11.458
-She's quite nice.
-Yeah.

06:11.541 --> 06:12.541
Hey.

06:13.375 --> 06:15.250
Hey. I thought you left.

06:16.041 --> 06:17.041
Yeah.

06:17.750 --> 06:19.791
That was kind of uncool of me.

06:21.333 --> 06:22.708
I didn't mean what I said.

06:24.916 --> 06:28.708
I just wanted to say that I respect
that you found all the material.

06:29.708 --> 06:31.125
You're really brilliant.

06:34.416 --> 06:38.458
I think I was just a bit scared
after I was abandoned

06:38.541 --> 06:41.791
with the violent psychos at the sawmill.

06:44.125 --> 06:45.708
So, I'm sorry.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.625
I know this is your project.

06:53.291 --> 06:55.708
-Do you want these?
-Of course.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.666
-All right. Strawberry…
-Thank you.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.750
I also wondered if I could see
the pictures of Jonas and Zannie again.

07:08.833 --> 07:12.041
-Ah! So that was why.
-No, it wasn't--

07:12.625 --> 07:14.000
-Stop it.
-It's okay.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.083
I'd like to--

07:25.625 --> 07:27.125
What a giant idiot!

07:27.625 --> 07:28.666
Shit!

07:29.291 --> 07:30.250
-Sorry!
-No…

07:30.333 --> 07:31.875
No, goddammit.

07:31.958 --> 07:35.333
-I'm really sorry.
-It's okay, Emma. I'll fix it.

07:36.666 --> 07:37.750
-Come here.
-Go away.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.458
-Let me see.
-Fuck off.

07:39.541 --> 07:41.750
Come on, man. Let's get your pants off.

07:41.833 --> 07:43.125
You don't need to help me.

07:43.208 --> 07:44.958
Relax. No one's here to see anything.

07:45.541 --> 07:47.125
It's a pain in the ass. Don't.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.416
No! Stop it.

07:49.208 --> 07:53.000
-Why are you so fucking spoiled?
-Get off me.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.416
-Don't grab my crotch.
-Relax, man.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.375
-Fuck off!
-I'm trying to help.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.416
Don't help me. I don't need your help.

08:01.750 --> 08:02.583
Relax.

08:02.666 --> 08:04.833
-It's really gross.
-It's not gross at all.

08:04.916 --> 08:05.750
Yes, it is!

08:07.625 --> 08:10.500
Why are you always so angry? Come on, man!

08:15.791 --> 08:17.333
-Hey.
-Hi.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.666
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

08:26.458 --> 08:27.666
But you lied.

08:31.875 --> 08:33.916
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

08:35.708 --> 08:38.083
You let me believe we had something.

08:41.666 --> 08:44.000
But we did, didn't we?

08:46.291 --> 08:47.291
Please…

08:48.291 --> 08:51.750
Could you just be honest from now on?

08:53.416 --> 08:56.416
I can't tell you how to feel…

08:58.708 --> 09:00.708
but I don't want to be lied to.

09:04.583 --> 09:07.375
Can't we just… start over?

09:13.250 --> 09:14.083
Sure.

09:15.791 --> 09:17.083
Hey. What's up?

09:18.208 --> 09:19.208
Are you back?

09:24.458 --> 09:25.625
No.

09:42.125 --> 09:43.208
Fuck.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.750
Fuck!

09:46.666 --> 09:49.291
She fucking took my hard drive!

09:58.083 --> 09:59.500
What am I looking for?

10:03.625 --> 10:04.916
You tell me.

10:06.875 --> 10:08.208
You're the one looking.

10:12.833 --> 10:14.416
How can you live here?

10:15.083 --> 10:16.875
I don't live here. I'm just here.

10:23.166 --> 10:24.583
I can't figure this out.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.166
It's just a computer.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.583
It's like you're from outer space.

10:32.125 --> 10:34.458
That's a joke. Give it to me.

10:36.666 --> 10:37.708
Okay.

10:40.583 --> 10:42.083
There are two folders.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.375
Let's try "south."

10:47.416 --> 10:48.416
That guy.

10:51.791 --> 10:53.041
He was at the sawmill.

10:54.416 --> 10:56.583
I know him. He's from back home.

10:56.666 --> 10:58.041
Where is he?

10:58.125 --> 10:59.583
There's an address.

11:00.250 --> 11:01.250
Let's go.

11:09.208 --> 11:11.291
-Where did you get that?
-I found it.

11:11.833 --> 11:14.041
-Found it?
-Yeah. It was just parked.

11:14.125 --> 11:17.250
-So you're driving a stolen car?
-But nobody was using it.

11:17.916 --> 11:19.958
That's not at all
how the system works here.

11:22.166 --> 11:24.416
You never explained
how you know how to drive.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I learned.

11:29.625 --> 11:31.708
My instructor says
I'm "directionally challenged."

11:31.791 --> 11:34.458
You're all so hung up on directions.
Right, left.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.416
North and south.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.541
-How do you navigate?
-It's easy.

11:39.708 --> 11:41.708
We always know where we are
and where we're going.

11:41.791 --> 11:43.083
Okay.

11:43.166 --> 11:44.541
How new age of you.

11:45.041 --> 11:46.666
We're just constantly lost here.

11:59.375 --> 12:01.625
Are you sure Emma gave it to them?

12:01.708 --> 12:02.708
A hundred percent.

12:07.791 --> 12:08.666
All right!

12:08.750 --> 12:10.166
Listen up!

12:12.000 --> 12:15.125
I want to talk to your leader.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.833
Now!

12:17.916 --> 12:19.333
I know what you're doing.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.000
Hello!

12:24.083 --> 12:25.750
Fucking do something!

12:31.541 --> 12:33.416
What do you want us to do?

12:35.583 --> 12:37.708
I want you to return my hard drive.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.208
Did someone take the boy's hard drive?

12:44.708 --> 12:45.750
Emma took it.

12:46.833 --> 12:47.833
Emma?

12:48.666 --> 12:50.250
I just need it back, okay?

12:53.125 --> 12:54.333
I know who you are.

12:55.458 --> 12:58.125
You call yourselves Astraeus,
but you're something else.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.666
You investigate extraterrestrial life.

13:03.291 --> 13:06.541
-I don't quite follow.
-I don't think that's your only problem.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.041
What's your theory then?

13:08.541 --> 13:11.208
I think that you just don't understand

13:11.291 --> 13:14.125
where the intergalactic signal
originated from.

13:14.208 --> 13:17.458
I think you're confused
because there were no more signals.

13:18.541 --> 13:22.916
I think you found information
about the meteor strike in Middelbo,

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
and it baffles you.

13:24.500 --> 13:28.208
It baffles you that there were
traces of recoil sediments in the crater.

13:28.291 --> 13:32.291
That would never happen unless the object
was trying to stop itself.

13:34.541 --> 13:35.541
Is that all?

13:38.291 --> 13:42.500
I think that everything you're hiding,
including my hard drive,

13:42.583 --> 13:44.166
is right behind

13:45.125 --> 13:46.250
that door.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.083
The welding hall.

14:05.416 --> 14:08.583
I don't know what you expected to find,
but it's not here.

14:12.125 --> 14:16.500
It's easy to connect the dots
and draw a conclusion.

14:17.166 --> 14:19.208
But that doesn't mean it's the right one.

14:20.833 --> 14:22.791
All right. Back to work.

15:23.625 --> 15:24.625
Yes?

15:26.166 --> 15:28.000
-Hi.
-Hello.

15:28.083 --> 15:29.791
We're looking for a man.

15:29.875 --> 15:30.875
This guy.

15:39.458 --> 15:40.708
Yes.

15:40.791 --> 15:43.750
-He might live here.
-When was the last time you saw him?

15:45.375 --> 15:46.791
I don't remember.

15:47.375 --> 15:48.500
Did he have any visitors?

15:49.083 --> 15:50.708
Who are you?

15:52.625 --> 15:53.625
It's my dad.

15:54.458 --> 15:55.458
Your dad?

15:56.791 --> 15:57.791
Yes.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.916
I haven't seen him in almost a year.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.791
He hasn't been well.

16:07.083 --> 16:08.458
I just want to see him again.

16:10.791 --> 16:12.333
All right, then.

16:12.416 --> 16:15.166
If you go that way
and then turn left at the cottages,

16:15.250 --> 16:17.291
he's at the end in the motor home.

16:17.375 --> 16:19.125
Okay. Thank you so much.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.625
Why did you say he's your dad?

16:26.708 --> 16:28.125
I had to say something.

16:28.208 --> 16:29.916
But it's not true.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.083
Nope.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.833
Why didn't she know it wasn't true?

16:33.333 --> 16:34.625
I sounded credible.

16:34.708 --> 16:36.041
I could tell.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.458
-You could tell I was lying?
-Yes.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.708
Don't you lie where you're from?

16:41.791 --> 16:43.000
No.

16:43.083 --> 16:45.041
All right. Boring.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.250
Hey.

16:47.750 --> 16:48.958
Do you think it's here?

17:29.416 --> 17:30.500
It's locked.

17:32.333 --> 17:33.916
That's usually not a problem.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.791
What the hell are you doing?

17:49.166 --> 17:50.583
We're trying to get in.

17:50.666 --> 17:52.291
We're looking for someone.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.708
You can't just break in.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.208
No.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.625
But…

17:58.708 --> 17:59.541
It's my dad.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.125
Your dad?

18:04.208 --> 18:05.500
I haven't seen him in…

18:06.500 --> 18:07.333
a year.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.958
I can't remember when I last spoke to him.

18:21.666 --> 18:23.416
He hasn't paid rent for two months.

18:24.416 --> 18:26.833
You can go in and take all his crap.

18:27.875 --> 18:29.916
Okay. Thanks.

18:31.041 --> 18:32.041
No!

18:51.458 --> 18:53.416
Take everything that could be his.

19:05.458 --> 19:08.416
Hey, why don't you
just relax for a second?

19:09.208 --> 19:11.000
Why should I? It's over.

19:11.916 --> 19:14.458
-It doesn't have to be.
-What do we do?

19:14.541 --> 19:16.500
Astraeus are actually building ships.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.583
I was wrong. That's all.

19:19.666 --> 19:21.625
And all those people we kept an eye on?

19:21.708 --> 19:24.500
-And the lists and the signal?
-None of that is worth shit!

19:25.208 --> 19:28.958
While we sat here, Emma's been
figuring out all the stuff I should have.

19:29.541 --> 19:30.583
I was supposed to…

19:34.541 --> 19:36.875
She took my hard drive. My knowledge.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.333
You can't let her
just take that from you, Mads.

19:40.666 --> 19:41.791
She screwed us over.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.583
She won. I thought I knew it all,
but I don't know shit.

19:44.666 --> 19:47.000
Can you just get lost? Seriously. Go away.

19:47.083 --> 19:50.041
But can we still… hang out here?

19:50.125 --> 19:53.333
I don't need you to drive me anywhere.
Got it, Frederik?

19:56.916 --> 19:57.875
No. Okay.

20:02.958 --> 20:04.375
Well done.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.583
What are you doing?

20:09.875 --> 20:12.166
-You have no other friends--
-Shut the fuck up.

20:12.791 --> 20:14.083
-Shut up.
-I'm just saying--

20:14.166 --> 20:15.958
Fuck off! Just fuck off!

20:16.041 --> 20:17.125
Get lost!

20:18.916 --> 20:19.916
Okay.

20:22.375 --> 20:24.208
Don't ever talk to me like that.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.250
What's that?

20:57.333 --> 20:59.291
Stuff I found over there.

21:01.916 --> 21:03.375
It looks like a prescription.

21:04.208 --> 21:05.333
What do we do with it?

21:05.958 --> 21:08.291
I don't know. It's a clue, I guess.

21:15.958 --> 21:17.125
Your dad!

21:18.458 --> 21:20.458
I think you need to practice lying.

21:22.458 --> 21:23.375
It worked.

21:23.458 --> 21:25.208
No, it didn't.

21:28.625 --> 21:30.416
What do you do on your planet?

21:31.166 --> 21:32.291
What do you mean?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.375
You don't lie.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.250
You have no directions.

21:38.583 --> 21:39.916
What kind of place is it?

21:43.250 --> 21:44.625
It's where I was created.

21:45.208 --> 21:46.583
It's where I belong.

21:49.458 --> 21:50.541
It's my home.

21:52.916 --> 21:54.375
But they took it away from you.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.291
I can't imagine how that must feel.

22:01.250 --> 22:03.000
Lukas, I'm trying…

22:03.791 --> 22:05.166
Here's your food.

22:08.166 --> 22:10.583
-What is that?
-Deep-fried breaded fish.

22:12.583 --> 22:14.041
You eat it with your hands.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.416
No, hold it with your fingers.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.958
You eat it with your mouth.

22:20.750 --> 22:21.750
Look…

22:35.333 --> 22:36.583
What's the point?

22:37.333 --> 22:40.375
-Of what?
-Wrapping food in food.

22:41.416 --> 22:44.666
It's for people who don't like fish.
You dip it in the wishing well.

22:48.375 --> 22:50.958
But if you don't like it,
why do you eat it?

22:51.041 --> 22:54.083
Once it's deep-fried,
everything tastes good.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.208
I don't think I understand you.

22:57.208 --> 22:58.791
And yet you want to save us.

22:59.583 --> 23:00.625
That's my mission.

23:10.583 --> 23:11.583
It's him.

23:18.916 --> 23:19.916
Wait here.

23:47.416 --> 23:48.416
Hi.

23:49.583 --> 23:50.500
Hi.

24:06.041 --> 24:07.166
What are you doing?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.541
Nothing much.

24:13.875 --> 24:15.375
So you're not with anyone or…?

24:17.000 --> 24:17.875
No.

24:57.666 --> 24:59.416
I just needed some food.

25:23.541 --> 25:27.875
Right… I'm going to grab a cola.

25:29.291 --> 25:30.291
Sure.

25:32.083 --> 25:32.958
Okay.

27:05.833 --> 27:06.833
Lukas?

28:29.708 --> 28:31.500
-Bye.
-Bye.

28:32.625 --> 28:33.625
Emma?

28:34.625 --> 28:35.625
Em…

29:00.958 --> 29:02.208
What the hell do we do?

29:02.791 --> 29:04.333
He's in the trunk.

29:05.708 --> 29:07.375
It doesn't matter.

29:07.458 --> 29:08.666
What do you mean?

29:14.416 --> 29:15.750
Fuck, that's gross.

29:17.041 --> 29:19.250
-He'll vanish soon.
-Vanish?

29:19.750 --> 29:22.500
-How?
-He'll dissolve.

29:22.583 --> 29:23.791
We need to get away.

29:28.916 --> 29:29.916
Come on.

29:31.708 --> 29:33.000
It's just over here.

29:34.500 --> 29:35.541
Shit.

29:36.291 --> 29:37.333
Come on.

29:38.333 --> 29:40.000
We'll go in through the basement.

29:48.125 --> 29:49.291
Come on.

29:54.541 --> 29:56.541
There you go. It's right in here.

30:17.333 --> 30:18.500
Press this against it.

30:24.958 --> 30:27.041
-I need some light.
-What?

30:27.125 --> 30:28.208
Strong light.

30:28.833 --> 30:29.833
Now!

30:32.125 --> 30:33.833
Let me see what I can find.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.416
-Hi, sweetie.
-Mom.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.208
-There's food in the kitchen.
-I'm not hungry.

30:46.375 --> 30:47.500
Sorry.

30:47.583 --> 30:51.541
I didn't handle the apartment stuff
terribly well. I'm sorry.

30:53.625 --> 30:56.916
-What's up?
-I love you, no matter where you are.

31:01.375 --> 31:02.916
You know those light therapy lamps?

31:03.500 --> 31:05.833
I think they're in there.

31:05.916 --> 31:07.166
Okay.

31:14.416 --> 31:16.208
What does the light do?

31:16.291 --> 31:17.916
It restores my energies.

31:18.625 --> 31:20.125
Your energies?

31:20.750 --> 31:21.791
They heal.

31:24.541 --> 31:26.041
We also have Ketogan.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.208
What's that?

31:30.083 --> 31:32.041
Tablets. Painkillers.

31:32.125 --> 31:33.500
They're my mom's.

31:35.291 --> 31:36.583
I don't need them.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.416
I have to remember to take mine.

31:45.875 --> 31:47.291
Are you in pain too?

31:49.916 --> 31:50.916
In a way.

31:51.666 --> 31:52.916
It's my mood.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.375
I have to. I need them.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Says who?

32:02.333 --> 32:03.708
My doctor.

32:03.791 --> 32:04.791
And my mom.

32:08.708 --> 32:10.208
And what if you don't take them?

32:12.958 --> 32:14.291
I don't know.

32:15.625 --> 32:17.250
I've always just taken them.

32:23.083 --> 32:24.958
Don't let others tell you what to do.

32:25.875 --> 32:28.916
Lead you in directions
you don't want to go in.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.791
You know best who you want to be.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.750
And that's who you'll be.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.166
Even if you're all on your own.

33:59.708 --> 34:01.833
I think we should talk after all.

34:47.291 --> 34:48.291
Lukas?

34:48.791 --> 34:49.791
Have a look.

34:51.500 --> 34:52.500
What?

34:53.291 --> 34:54.750
It's the same handwriting.

34:57.916 --> 35:00.000
It's my doctor, Susan. She…

35:01.166 --> 35:02.333
She had an affair with Hans.

35:02.416 --> 35:04.750
She's writing prescriptions
for another one of them.

35:07.083 --> 35:08.750
That means she knows something.

35:10.250 --> 35:12.000
I mean, it can't be a coincidence.

35:13.458 --> 35:15.333
-Let's drive over there.
-In what?

35:15.875 --> 35:17.083
We'll find something.

35:20.291 --> 35:22.458
Hey, put on some clothes first.

35:23.333 --> 35:25.166
-Clothes?
-Yes.

35:25.250 --> 35:28.458
Your own clothes are trashed.
You can borrow some of my mom's.

35:30.125 --> 35:31.875
Or are you too gender normative for that?

35:34.541 --> 35:36.416
Never mind. I'll find something.

36:01.541 --> 36:02.375
Come in.

36:28.041 --> 36:29.291
You were right.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.458
You knew.

36:36.916 --> 36:37.875
Who are you?

36:39.375 --> 36:41.208
We are what you see here.

36:41.791 --> 36:43.125
And so much more.

36:44.666 --> 36:46.541
We've existed for longer
than you can imagine.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.583
We've always been looking for this.

36:51.958 --> 36:53.291
Extraterrestrial life.

36:54.875 --> 36:58.208
We want to be the link between
what's out there and us, here on Earth.

37:01.625 --> 37:03.833
How did you know about the recoil impact?

37:05.208 --> 37:06.708
What's in it for me?

37:07.416 --> 37:09.000
You'll join us.

37:09.833 --> 37:11.250
Isn't that enough?

37:12.416 --> 37:13.916
Tell me everything you know.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.041
If this gets out, I want my name on it.

37:20.291 --> 37:22.625
-We don't want this to get out.
-But if it does.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.666
If it does, we have a deal.

37:26.916 --> 37:28.625
You mentioned a hard drive.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.583
She's got it. Emma.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.291
So, why am I talking to you?

37:38.375 --> 37:39.875
I can get it back.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.208
That would be a great idea.

37:42.708 --> 37:44.208
As quickly as possible.

37:54.625 --> 37:56.125
You have to find her.

37:56.791 --> 38:00.208
I know what I said,
but I really need that hard drive now.

38:00.291 --> 38:01.875
<i>I don't know where she is.</i>

38:02.375 --> 38:03.916
<i>Why do you need it now?</i>

38:04.000 --> 38:05.416
-Why?
<i>-Yes.</i>

38:07.208 --> 38:09.000
Because I was right, Marie.

38:10.125 --> 38:13.500
<i>And everything's on the drive,</i>
<i>so nobody other than me can look at it.</i>

38:15.250 --> 38:16.250
Okay.

38:48.291 --> 38:50.166
That's Susan's medical practice.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.500
It actually suits you.

38:56.250 --> 38:57.250
Baby blue.

39:11.708 --> 39:12.750
Baby blue.

39:49.750 --> 39:50.750
Okay.

39:51.291 --> 39:52.583
Just stay in the car.

43:11.916 --> 43:15.708
Pick up. Don't go home. Just call me.

43:25.250 --> 43:27.625
-What's happening?
-She had these.

43:31.208 --> 43:33.208
She had these samples.

43:34.125 --> 43:35.666
It looks like Hans' blood.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.250
And the guy from the cafe's.

43:50.708 --> 43:51.916
Shit, it's her.

43:53.583 --> 43:54.583
Go.

44:03.041 --> 44:04.750
Wait. She's coming back out.

44:05.875 --> 44:07.083
Pull over here.

44:08.750 --> 44:10.208
Let's see what she does.

44:15.166 --> 44:16.541
What the hell is she doing?

44:18.000 --> 44:20.500
Shit, she's leaving.
Maybe she'll lead us to them.

44:22.083 --> 44:23.083
Follow her.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.083
Where's she going?

44:42.708 --> 44:44.791
-What are you doing?
-She knows you.

44:44.875 --> 44:47.625
-I want to see if she's meeting anyone.
-Not in those clothes.

44:49.416 --> 44:50.541
We'll wait here.

45:07.375 --> 45:08.666
Was she just shopping?

45:10.083 --> 45:12.916
You don't go shopping
if you've just been burgled.

45:19.125 --> 45:20.125
What?

45:33.666 --> 45:35.125
Do you know them?

45:35.208 --> 45:36.208
No.

45:50.375 --> 45:51.500
Are you sure?

45:56.750 --> 45:57.750
Okay.

46:07.458 --> 46:09.000
I have to go to work.

46:38.625 --> 46:40.166
Come on in, eh?

47:20.708 --> 47:22.041
Mom!

48:21.625 --> 48:25.250
