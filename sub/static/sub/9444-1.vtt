01:39.308 --> 01:40.309
Oh, John.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.228
John, this is Lieutenant Colonel Sinclair.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.188
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.

01:44.355 --> 01:46.607
Sinclair is here
from Washington, observing.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.566
Oh.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.735
Yeah, she spent the last two years
researching the project.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.904
Till they finally decided to go
with your approach.

01:52.196 --> 01:54.740
Yeah, I heard about your idea.
Something about a steel cage?

01:55.366 --> 01:56.283
An exoskeleton.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.119
- Exoskeleton.
- Mm-hm.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.788
The steel frame allowed me
to control the deceased units

02:01.080 --> 02:04.875
and at the same time offer the mobility
to make them highly effective bio-weapons.

02:05.584 --> 02:09.713
Well, lucky for me the Pentagon decided on
a more humane approach.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.805
<i>Postmortem team to Sector Six
Bio-Engineering.</i>

02:18.681 --> 02:22.226
<i>Postmortem team

02:28.941 --> 02:31.944
Walsh, let me use
your card key, please.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.654
I seem to have misplaced mine
at home.

02:34.113 --> 02:35.281
Don't let it worry you.

02:35.281 --> 02:37.950
From what I've seen here,
security seems rather a low priority.

02:38.450 --> 02:41.453
Ah, well, those damn budget-chopping
fools in Congress.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.956
If it wasn't for them,
we'd have a permanent facility by now.

03:01.932 --> 03:06.020
[music]

03:11.901 --> 03:14.236
God, Julie, what are you doing?
You're so mental!

03:17.865 --> 03:19.909
[motorcycle]
Lone Ranger's here.

03:25.956 --> 03:26.957
Did you get it?

03:26.957 --> 03:27.917
I said I Would, didn't I?

03:27.917 --> 03:28.959
Let me see, come on.

03:30.211 --> 03:33.088
I had my dad look all over the house for it
but he just couldn't seem to find it.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.342
Oh, Curt, this is so cool!

03:43.432 --> 03:44.558
So how do we get on base?

03:45.100 --> 03:47.478
No problem, I'm the boss' son, remember?
I can do anything.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.773
Are you guys gonna do
Club Kill with us tonight or what?

03:51.440 --> 03:52.274
I'll call you later.

03:53.192 --> 03:54.276
So, did you find out anything else?

03:55.110 --> 03:56.570
Not any more than I heard
on the phone last night.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.740
The big test, or whatever it is,
starts at 6:00.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.574
What test?

04:00.783 --> 04:02.493
No test, Mindy. Butt out!

04:03.869 --> 04:04.954
God, it's so cool.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.081
I bet they're cutting up
some poor animals or something.

04:08.207 --> 04:09.208
What time is it?

04:10.084 --> 04:11.001
It's 5330.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.296
5:30? Come on, boy scout.
We gotta jam!

04:19.677 --> 04:20.552
Woo!

05:01.552 --> 05:04.263
If the preliminary results
are any indication,

05:04.263 --> 05:06.140
maybe something good
will finally come

05:06.140 --> 05:07.808
from the Trioxin after all.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.935
MAN: Secure harness wrist.
- I'm sure it will, sir.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.521
MAN: Shoulders.
MAN 2: Check.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.231
MAN 1: Back.
MAN 21 Check.

05:14.398 --> 05:15.733
SINCLAIR: You were part of the original team

05:15.733 --> 05:18.193
that commissioned Trioxin
from Darrow Chemical weren't you, sir?

05:18.193 --> 05:19.153
I certainly was.

05:19.862 --> 05:22.323
We were going to use it
as a weapon against the war on marijuana

05:22.323 --> 05:24.533
and then came that leak in '69.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.160
We found out about
its special properties.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.454
We did the only thing we could.

05:28.746 --> 05:33.000
After the gas brought the dead back to life,
we rounded them up, stuffed them in those barrels.

05:33.584 --> 05:36.170
Didn't know then we'd never be able
to destroy them.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.136
How you doing?
Going to see my dad.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.109
Come on!

05:59.693 --> 06:00.903
It's G-17.

06:01.153 --> 06:02.071
Same as on the card.

06:02.613 --> 06:03.572
Let's try it.
[buzz]

06:05.324 --> 06:06.158
Shit!

06:06.575 --> 06:07.409
Let me try.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.121
What are you doing?

06:14.166 --> 06:15.209
[beep]

06:17.920 --> 06:18.962
It's all in the tongue.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.091
Come on.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.392
Curt, look at all this!

06:33.936 --> 06:35.062
It's incredible!

06:41.485 --> 06:42.528
Okay.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.154
[buzz]
Yeah I think this is--

06:51.161 --> 06:52.162
Hurry up! Come on!

06:52.162 --> 06:54.873
<i>Please give a status report on 1800 hour

06:55.374 --> 06:56.875
Commencing rounds now.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.259
Shh.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.144
Come on, let's go.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.736
What's this glass here for?

07:25.529 --> 07:28.031
I don't know.
Looks like they want to keep it airtight.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.117
Check it out.
You can still see inside.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.703
Oh, my God.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.496
What are they doing in there?

07:35.747 --> 07:36.582
CURT: My God.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.292
JULIE: Shit!

07:38.542 --> 07:39.668
This is creepy!

07:42.254 --> 07:44.298
- Come on!
- Okay, okay!

<i>Flatline set.</i>

08:05.903 --> 08:06.904
We're all set here, sir.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.322
All right.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.990
Let's proceed.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.458
God, Julie, that's my dad.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.293
Don't worry, they can't see us.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.754
Is that guy hanging in there dead?

08:24.338 --> 08:25.923
Are you kidding? Definitely!

08:27.966 --> 08:28.926
Come on.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.768
MAN: All vital signs

All right.
I'm opening the valve now.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.407

10:56.365 --> 10:57.783
- Yes!
- Looks like we did it!

10:58.367 --> 10:59.284
Affirmative.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.579
Paralysis has been
successfully attained.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.040
This is really warped.

11:06.958 --> 11:07.918
I can't believe my dad!

11:10.045 --> 11:11.546
God, I know!

11:11.546 --> 11:12.673
How did they do it?

11:16.259 --> 11:17.761
I knew this would be
worth checking out, Curt.

11:17.761 --> 11:18.845
I just knew it.

11:24.893 --> 11:25.936
We gotta get out of here.

11:36.947 --> 11:37.781
Come on.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.591
It's okay, Curt.
He didn't see us.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.343
Look, Julie. I don't care.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.053
I've seen enough.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.975
Son of a bitch, John!

12:05.642 --> 12:07.436
You have just changed
warfare forever!

12:07.811 --> 12:11.314
I mean, we can put those bio-units in
and have them run roughshod over the enemy,

12:11.565 --> 12:15.235
then just stroll on in, freeze them up,
pack them away until the next time.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.070
I must admit, Reynolds,

12:17.070 --> 12:20.782
even though the exoskeletal
approach would be more efficient,

12:20.782 --> 12:22.659
there's no arguing with your results.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.995
Thank you.
This was really a team effort.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.246
Don't be modest, John.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.873
This was your baby from the start.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.753
You know it was John who figured out these
poor dead bastards craved brains

12:32.753 --> 12:35.005
so they could get electricity
from the neurons.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.757
Oh, is that right?

12:37.174 --> 12:40.010
JOHN: Then it was a matter of
developing the acid projectiles

12:40.010 --> 12:41.261
to freeze them up again.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.638
- Well we're on our way now.

- What's going on?

13:00.572 --> 13:01.823
The paralysis didn't hold!

13:06.119 --> 13:08.413
Warn security!
We're all under containment right now!

13:30.310 --> 13:31.603
Use the projectiles!

13:36.274 --> 13:37.734
Hook me up, damn it!
Hook me up!

13:45.617 --> 13:46.660
Turn it up!
Load it!

13:54.543 --> 13:56.419
Shoot the son of a bitch!
Load it again!

He killed Dr. Hickox.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.103
John, what happened?

14:14.354 --> 14:15.438
What the hell happened?

14:15.856 --> 14:16.690
I don't know.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.066
It didn't hold.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.819
Strap that thing down
before it wakes up again!

14:24.072 --> 14:25.240
Ready? Lift.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.367
Get the gurney.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.288
All right, strap him down.
I'll get the legs.

14:31.913 --> 14:32.789
You get the arms.

14:40.672 --> 14:41.506
Tight.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.883
Get that tight there.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.092

14:50.432 --> 14:51.892
Put on the mouth restraint.

14:52.642 --> 14:53.476
- Put it in.
- Sure.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.942
What am I gonna tell them?
What the hell am I gonna tell them?

15:03.528 --> 15:05.822
Double tighten the restraints.
Especially that mouthpiece.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.034
That ought to hold him.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.287
Ahhh!

15:12.704 --> 15:13.788
Jesus Christ!

15:14.039 --> 15:14.873
It didn't hold!

15:16.875 --> 15:18.293
Get him off me!

15:18.960 --> 15:20.003
Get him off me!

15:20.253 --> 15:21.254

Please!

15:48.657 --> 15:50.325
I got him! I got him!

15:51.242 --> 15:52.827
Send a team in there.
Get everyone out.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.205
I want them all tied down,
living or dead.

15:55.914 --> 15:56.873
Put them all under observation.

15:57.374 --> 16:00.418

what the hell happened here.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.171

16:03.546 --> 16:07.217
John, Washington is expecting
a call from me right now!

What am I gonna tell them?
What the hell am I gonna tell them?

16:09.970 --> 16:12.013
Don't worry, Colonel.
I'll take care of it.

16:12.013 --> 16:16.351
Before I left, I told General Meed that I'd call him
just to give my objective opinion.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.108
[music playing]

16:28.029 --> 16:31.700
[heavy breathing]

16:41.292 --> 16:43.086
God, Curt, that was incredible, wasn't it?

16:43.503 --> 16:44.337
Oh, yeah.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.047
That was great.

16:49.134 --> 16:50.427
I wonder if he could feel anything.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.221
What?

16:54.055 --> 16:55.724
When that bullet
smashed into his skull.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.143
The dead guy.
I wonder if he could feel anything.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.185
Julie,shh.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.396
And that scream.
You remember that horrible scream?

17:01.396 --> 17:02.355
I'm trying not to.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.483
God, I bet he was in hell.
It must be awful to be dead.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.154
Look, Julie, would you just give it a rest.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.531
What? What's the matter?

17:12.490 --> 17:13.825
You're so carried away with all this.

17:16.618 --> 17:17.537
And you're not?

17:19.914 --> 17:21.332
We don't even know what we saw.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.501
We don't know if that was a corpse.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.005
It could have been a mental patient
or somebody in a coma.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.632
No way, Curt, that was definitely a corpse.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.931
You're still hung-up about
seeing your dad there aren't you.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.311
Julie, I told you,
I don't care about my dad.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.439
Never see him anyways.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.149
Good.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.526
Because you don't need him.

17:49.069 --> 17:49.986
You've got me.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.282
I know.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.409
I'm never gonna let you go.

- What?

Curtis.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.608
Yes, sir?

18:29.442 --> 18:30.527
Need to talk with you, son.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.322
What is it, Dad?

18:38.034 --> 18:40.286
I need to talk with you...
alone.

18:42.413 --> 18:43.998
In my office.

18:47.710 --> 18:48.837
I think he knows something.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.508
[sigh]

19:06.187 --> 19:07.021
What is it, Dad?

19:07.564 --> 19:08.606
Sit down, Son.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.903
I, uh...
got a little bad news tonight.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.613
I'm being reassigned
to another project.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.157
What?

19:18.366 --> 19:19.951
Being relocated to Oklahoma City.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.036
We report in a week.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.454
Oklahoma City?

19:24.914 --> 19:26.541
Dad, we just got here six months ago.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.459
Listen, Curtis, I'm sorry.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.378
I don't like this any more than you do

19:30.378 --> 19:32.714
but it's nothing we haven't done
a dozen times before.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.216
So I want you to have your room
packed by Saturday.

19:36.384 --> 19:38.845
Sunday you can start on the garage.

19:45.476 --> 19:47.854
Listen, you didn't happen to find that card key,
we were looking for did you?

19:50.231 --> 19:51.065
No, I didn't.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.736
I don't understand it.

19:54.736 --> 19:57.071
Son of a bitch's got to be
around here somewhere.

20:04.996 --> 20:05.997
Is there something else?

20:11.252 --> 20:12.378
Dad, I'm not gonna go.

20:14.088 --> 20:14.923
What?

20:15.381 --> 20:16.382
I'm not gonna go.

20:16.883 --> 20:17.884
I don't want to go.

20:18.509 --> 20:19.928
I finally got friends here now.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.263
Curtis, maybe I didn't make myself clear.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.432
I'm being transferred.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.684
We leave in a week.

20:26.851 --> 20:27.685
Both of us.

20:28.269 --> 20:29.103
I'm not gonna go.

20:30.271 --> 20:31.439
Curtis!

20:31.773 --> 20:32.774
What?

20:33.733 --> 20:37.028
Son, I have tried to be very understanding
of you in the last few weeks.

20:37.862 --> 20:38.947
I let you get that motorcycle.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.907
I even put up with you wanting to be
rock-n-roll drummer

20:40.907 --> 20:42.200
because I know you'll outgrow it.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.703
But this is where draw the line.
I will not have you defying me on this.

20:45.703 --> 20:46.829
Now do you understand me?

20:47.497 --> 20:49.582
And don't think I don't know
where this is coming from either.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.918
Getting you away from that girl would be
the best thing that ever happened to you.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.127
Dad, I'm not going!

20:54.545 --> 20:56.839
Curtis, I'm not finished
talking with you yet!

20:57.799 --> 20:59.425
Don't walk away from me!

21:03.137 --> 21:03.972
What's going on?

21:04.722 --> 21:05.932
My dad's being
reassigned again.

21:07.642 --> 21:08.685
I told him I'm not going.

21:08.685 --> 21:09.519
You're kidding!

21:09.811 --> 21:10.937
Nope. I'm not kidding.

21:11.729 --> 21:12.855
I'm on my own.

21:14.816 --> 21:15.733
You mean you're moving out?

21:16.067 --> 21:17.527
Yeah, it's just me and you.

21:20.863 --> 21:21.990
I'm not finished with you yet.

21:22.365 --> 21:23.199
Yes, you are.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.034
God damn it, get back to my office!

21:25.034 --> 21:26.327
Hey, why don't you just leave him alone.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.745
Tell your friend to stay out of our business.

21:27.745 --> 21:28.997
Why don't you tell her yourself?

21:29.872 --> 21:31.249
Julie, come on, let's go.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.504
Damn it. You never acted like this
when your mother was alive.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.508
You keep your hands off of me!

21:42.051 --> 21:43.052
Freak.

21:43.678 --> 21:44.595
Come on, Curt.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.180
We're going.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.939
I can't believe you did it, Curt.
I cannot believe it.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.441
We're actually free!
This is great!

21:56.858 --> 22:00.028
I bet it'll be at least a week before
my mother even notices I'm gone.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.487
Send her a postcard.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.614
Whooo!

22:04.032 --> 22:04.991
Whoa!

22:04.991 --> 22:06.409
Julie, take it easy!

22:06.409 --> 22:09.579
Take it easy?
Hey, I've never taken it easy on you.

22:11.122 --> 22:13.666
You're mine, honey, all mine.

22:14.000 --> 22:14.834
Julie!

22:15.460 --> 22:16.627
- Whoo!
Come on, Julie, stop it!

22:18.671 --> 22:21.299
What's wrong?
You losing control, huh?

23:50.555 --> 23:51.722
You promised me!

30:52.893 --> 30:54.812
What's going on, Curt?
Tell me what happened.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.815
We had an accident.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.067
What kind of an accident?

31:01.151 --> 31:02.111

<i>Jesus, Curt.</i>

32:56.350 --> 32:57.351
What have you done?

32:58.143 --> 33:01.563
John, I put out a statewide APB
on your son's motorcycle.

33:02.398 --> 33:05.484
Also I have the containment squad
assembling right now.

33:08.821 --> 33:10.030
What are his chances?

33:10.030 --> 33:13.075
It seems that his girlfriend has been
brought back completely intact.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.578
And obviously there was a very strong
connection between them.

33:16.745 --> 33:19.665
And that should be enough to keep her
from attacking him...

33:19.665 --> 33:22.751
at least until
her brain shuts down.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.420
If she attacks him,

33:24.420 --> 33:26.005
he becomes like her.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.341
Pentagon Special Command
will be here in six hours.

33:30.467 --> 33:31.593

33:31.593 --> 33:33.095
Thank you, Colonel.

33:33.095 --> 33:38.684
I also suggested to General Meed that I
go ahead and take over scientific operations.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.060
I don't think you quite understand.

33:40.060 --> 33:43.397
Your command does not start
till 0900 hours tomorrow morning.

33:43.397 --> 33:46.442
Yes, I do understand,
but under the circumstances...

33:46.442 --> 33:47.901
No.

You don't smell.

I think I'll be okay.

I'm just trying to find someplace open.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.525
I saw a store back there.
Why don't we go back there?

34:28.525 --> 34:30.485
There's too many people.
I need to find a place where there's no people.

34:30.485 --> 34:31.445

53:54.065 --> 53:54.982
Come on, Son.

53:55.650 --> 53:56.776
Where are you?

53:57.151 --> 53:59.570
John, will you not beat yourself up
about this.

53:59.570 --> 54:00.696
We're doing everything we can.

54:00.696 --> 54:02.490
Yeah, but it just doesn't seem
to be enough, does it?.

54:02.865 --> 54:04.408
Sir, we found their escape route.

54:04.825 --> 54:08.412
It's a storm drain that leads from here
to the viaduct under the river bridge.

54:08.412 --> 54:10.289
All right, notify the rest of the troops.
Give them our 20.

54:11.499 --> 54:12.416
John, hold it.

54:14.669 --> 54:15.920
This just arrived from General Meed.

54:17.588 --> 54:18.589
Son of a bitch!

54:19.340 --> 54:20.174
What is it?

54:20.424 --> 54:21.884
You're officially being relieved
of your command.

54:22.343 --> 54:24.512
I'm to take over science operations
effective immediately.

54:24.762 --> 54:26.013
Sergeant!

54:26.555 --> 54:27.515
Yes, ma'am?

54:27.515 --> 54:29.100
As of now I'm in control of this situation.

54:29.267 --> 54:32.019
I want it upgraded immediately
to total indiscriminate containment.

54:32.186 --> 54:33.187
A what?

54:33.354 --> 54:35.856
I said there was to be no discrimination
during containment.

54:36.524 --> 54:38.359
God damn it, that's my son
you're talking about!

54:38.359 --> 54:40.444
The odds are your son is probably
contaminated already.

54:40.820 --> 54:41.988
Yeah, well there's still a chance.

54:42.655 --> 54:43.906
A chance isn't good enough.

54:45.032 --> 54:46.325
Reynolds, what are you doing?

54:46.909 --> 54:48.244
I'm going after my son.

54:48.619 --> 54:50.121
You're no longer part of this effort.

54:50.121 --> 54:50.955
Come on!

55:24.864 --> 55:26.615
[moans]
What's the matter?

55:27.033 --> 55:27.867
I don't know.

55:29.994 --> 55:32.330
I get these cramps.
I feel so stiff.

55:33.164 --> 55:33.998
Come on.

55:44.800 --> 55:45.926
Come on!

55:51.807 --> 55:52.641
Come on.

56:06.072 --> 56:06.906
Come.

56:20.169 --> 56:21.003
Shut the door!

56:27.259 --> 56:28.677
[Sparks]

56:31.847 --> 56:34.350
They'll never find you down here.

56:34.350 --> 56:35.768
What is this place?

56:35.768 --> 56:37.728
It's a pump room.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.105
I call it home.

56:47.446 --> 56:48.489
Good lord!

56:49.323 --> 56:50.533
She is cold!

56:52.159 --> 56:53.160
Here.

57:01.794 --> 57:02.628
Thanks.

57:05.381 --> 57:08.008
What kind of trouble
are you in, anyway?

57:10.010 --> 57:11.262
Come on, kid!

57:11.887 --> 57:12.847
Level with me!

57:13.472 --> 57:16.851
I may live with rats,
but I sure as hell ain't one of them!

57:20.187 --> 57:21.397
We were on our way to Seattle.

57:23.190 --> 57:24.525
We got into a mess with those guys.

57:26.068 --> 57:27.653
There was an argument
and a guy was shot.

57:28.863 --> 57:30.156
Did you do it?

57:32.700 --> 57:34.201
No, they did, then they took off.

57:46.922 --> 57:48.048
<i>So...</i>

57:49.008 --> 57:50.509
what are you gonna do in Seattle?

57:52.011 --> 57:52.928
I don't know.

57:54.346 --> 57:57.141
Get a job or something.
Maybe get a gig in a band playing drums.

57:59.226 --> 58:00.728
You a musician?

58:00.728 --> 58:01.979
I don't know.

58:02.354 --> 58:04.523
Never been in a band,
but it's what I want to do.

58:04.857 --> 58:06.192
Ha ha!

58:07.234 --> 58:08.360
I know it sounds stupid.

58:11.906 --> 58:13.240
Don't sound stupid to me.

58:18.412 --> 58:20.456
It doesn't?
You don't think it sounds crazy?

58:21.582 --> 58:22.500
Hell, no.

58:24.084 --> 58:28.339
Sounds like you got something inside you
you just gotta get out.

58:29.381 --> 58:31.425
Like <i>me...</i>

58:31.425 --> 58:32.468
me and my things.

58:33.302 --> 58:34.428
I figure if...

58:35.554 --> 58:37.556
people found out
what they had inside them

58:38.224 --> 58:39.350
and how to get it out,

58:39.975 --> 58:43.270
there'd be a lot
more happy people.

58:46.649 --> 58:47.816
So you really think I could do it?

58:48.359 --> 58:50.110
Sure. Why not?

58:53.822 --> 58:56.158
'Course, what do I know?

58:57.201 --> 59:00.496
You're talking to a guy
who lives in the sewers.

59:04.708 --> 59:06.210
You two stay here...

59:07.378 --> 59:08.504
and rest.

59:09.421 --> 59:11.006
I'll keep a watch outside.

59:14.218 --> 59:15.636
Hey-

59:16.387 --> 59:17.555
Look, uh...

59:18.597 --> 59:19.723
I don't even know your name.

59:20.224 --> 59:21.517
So?

59:22.476 --> 59:23.644
I wanted to say thanks.

59:24.770 --> 59:25.729
Thanks for everything.

59:25.729 --> 59:29.149
And I'm probably never gonna have
a chance to repay you.

59:38.242 --> 59:39.243
Here.

59:40.744 --> 59:42.246
What's this?

59:42.246 --> 59:43.747
<i>March Gras com.</i>

59:43.747 --> 59:46.667
Next time you find someone
who needs help,

59:46.667 --> 59:50.170
you just help him out
and give him that coin.

59:50.170 --> 59:52.798
And you tell him to do the same
for somebody else.

59:54.383 --> 59:56.969
I figure as long as that coin
keeps circulating,

59:58.387 --> 01:00:00.264
there'll always be
somebody out there

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:03.392
doing something good
for somebody.

01:00:05.394 --> 01:00:06.645
You got a deal.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.275
You can call me Riverman.

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:16.572
Come on, vamanos.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.490
Aw, not in there!

01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:20.326
Hey! Let's just go!

01:00:20.576 --> 01:00:22.786
Jesus Christ! Come on!

01:00:23.454 --> 01:00:24.997
Gross, man!

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:26.332
Follow me.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:28.417
Santos!

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:30.836
I think we should get Mogo to a hospital!

01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:33.172
Once we find the bitch!

01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:34.173
That chingando!

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:37.384
Santos, a rat!

01:00:37.843 --> 01:00:39.053
Shh! Calmate!

01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:42.389
Come on!

01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:46.935
Orale.

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:50.814
Yeah.

01:00:59.365 --> 01:01:00.366
Julie?

01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:05.287
What are we gonna do?

01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:07.289
What's gonna happen to us?

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:10.209
Wanna know
what's gonna happen to us?

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:12.920
We're gonna move to Seattle.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.256
We're gonna get
a nice place on the water.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.510
I'm gonna get a gig in a band.

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:22.096
You're gonna hang out all night and party
and watch me play.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.188
Do you really think we'll make it?

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:33.899
Of course I do.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:54.420
Julie, what's the matter?

01:01:55.129 --> 01:01:56.588
Julie, what's wrong?

01:01:57.506 --> 01:01:59.341
I can't do this anymore.

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:02.177
What?

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:03.053
I can't...

01:02:03.971 --> 01:02:05.556
I can't keep pretending.

01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:07.141
<i>I mean...</i>

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:10.227
I want it to be like it was before,

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.146
but...

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:14.356
I don't feel the same.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:18.527
<i>I just...</i>

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:20.320
<i>I feel...</i>

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.906
Oh, God, I feel so goddamn hungry!

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.199
Julie...

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:25.075
Julie, come back to bed.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.746
I can't stand...

01:02:29.163 --> 01:02:30.873
being like this!

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.375
Julie, what's wrong? What's wrong?

01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:55.898
Julie, what are you doing?

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:00.402
Nothing.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:02.279
Nothing.

01:03:17.628 --> 01:03:18.796
I'm sorry, Curt.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.260
Curt, I'm sorry.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.849
I just get a little confused
sometimes.

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.333
Come on!

01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:03.841
We're never gonna find
our way out of here!

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:04.675
Shut up!

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:08.220
They gotta be here somewhere, ese.

01:04:11.098 --> 01:04:13.433
- We're never gonna find our way out of here!
- Just shut up!

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:17.729
Run the license on that car.

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:32.012
Shhh!

01:05:39.645 --> 01:05:40.687

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:42.814
Orale, ese.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:45.317
Shhh!

01:05:50.072 --> 01:05:51.198
Wake up, Caca!

01:05:54.076 --> 01:05:55.118
Where is she?

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:00.415
Where is she?

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.920
Aaaaah!

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:09.424
Where is she?

01:06:10.092 --> 01:06:11.468
I don't know.

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:15.097
Spit it out, ese!

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:18.934
Where am I?

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:21.395
What's wrong with me?

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:23.188
Santo!

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:26.900
I don't think Mogo's gonna make it
unless we get him out of here now!

01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:28.694
I know.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:31.154
Not until he tells me
where the bitch is!

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:35.742
Yes!

01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:43.792

Pedazo de mierda.

Okay, you little bastard.

What did we do to you?

We didn't do anything!

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:05.136
Julie!

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.972
What have you done?

01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:17.065
Kill her! Kill her, Felipe!

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:19.859
Kill it!

01:11:50.015 --> 01:11:51.725
You crazy bitch!

01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:57.188
Julie, stop it!

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:09.951
Fuck!

01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:12.662
Stop it!

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:14.164
Stop it! No!

01:12:14.164 --> 01:12:15.123
Don't do it.

01:12:16.124 --> 01:12:18.460
What happened to you, Julie?
How could you?

01:12:19.044 --> 01:12:22.881
I can't help it, Curt.
The hunger!

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:26.051
Aaaah!

01:12:26.468 --> 01:12:27.510
[scream]

01:12:29.054 --> 01:12:30.805
Hey, kid, get in here!

01:12:38.897 --> 01:12:39.731
Not her.

01:12:40.732 --> 01:12:42.692
- Look, I'm not going anywhere without Julie.
- Uh-uh.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:44.194
[Speaking Spanish]

01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:45.528
Come on, let's go!

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:47.155
Let us in!

01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:48.990
Get in here!

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:51.743
Bolt it!

01:12:52.786 --> 01:12:53.912
Holy mother of Christ!

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:55.705
I owe us.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:57.248
The zombies.

01:12:57.832 --> 01:12:59.667
Abre la puerta!

01:13:02.087 --> 01:13:03.505
This isn't gonna hold him!

01:13:06.383 --> 01:13:08.134
She dead, ain't she?

01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:10.387
God damn it, help us!

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:32.450
This way.

01:13:43.962 --> 01:13:45.463
Where are the nails?

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:49.050
Curt, help me!

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:51.761
I'm losing myself, Curt.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:56.766
When it doesn't hurt,
I get hungry.

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:00.478
The pain isn't helping anymore.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.948
I'm getting hungry again

01:14:14.534 --> 01:14:15.535
It's okay.

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:23.334
Help me! Curt, help me!
Tie me up, please!

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:24.961
- What are you doing?
- Tie me up!

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:28.673
Don't you see what's happening?
Just tie me up!

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:30.758
I'm one of them.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:35.472
Shit!

01:14:37.599 --> 01:14:38.433
[speaking foreign language]

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:42.854
Let's get through.

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:50.320
This door's not gonna hold them!

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:54.491
They got the door!

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:02.832
Oh, shit!

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:04.584
Is there any way out of here?

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:05.793
Uh-huh!

01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:07.295
There's a ladder.

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:08.379
Where does it go?

01:15:08.379 --> 01:15:09.422
Up to the street.

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:10.840
We're not gonna make it!
We don't have time!

01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:13.426
I got an idea.

01:15:20.892 --> 01:15:23.102
Damn! It's not holding!

01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:30.318
You go. I'll stay and hold them off.

01:15:30.318 --> 01:15:32.695
Look, you got a bullet in your leg.
I can get away faster.

01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:34.239
Take Julie and go!

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:36.866
Her? Are you crazy?

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:38.660
It's too late for her.

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:40.578
You listen to me, goddamn it!

01:15:40.578 --> 01:15:42.205
We're getting out of here!
All of us! Do you hear me?

01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:43.373
All of us!

01:15:43.915 --> 01:15:45.124
Now, you take Julie and go!

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:46.501
No!

01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:48.545
Take Julie with you!

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:52.298
[painful screams]

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:57.387
God help us!

01:17:03.328 --> 01:17:04.162
Julie?

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:06.623
Riverman?

01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:12.211
[squishing sound]

01:17:28.645 --> 01:17:30.021
Oh, my God!

01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:31.939
Julie, not him!

01:17:35.777 --> 01:17:38.821

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:05.431
Help me.

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:08.476
Help me end this pain.

01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:14.357
What have I done?

01:18:19.112 --> 01:18:20.321
<i>Colonel Reynolds, over here.</i>

01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:22.573
<i>We've got four contaminated units.</i>
- Take him.

01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:50.852
[beeping]
Again.

01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.907
Watch behind!

01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:07.702
Curt, get away from her!

01:19:08.745 --> 01:19:09.746
No!

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:11.706
Get away from her, Son.

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:16.377
No!

01:19:18.296 --> 01:19:19.714
No, Curt!

01:19:21.799 --> 01:19:23.468
Don't leave me.

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:25.303
Get out of the away, Son!

01:19:27.597 --> 01:19:28.556
Get away from her.

01:19:29.557 --> 01:19:30.850
[whimpering]

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:32.560

01:19:44.572 --> 01:19:45.615
[gasping]

01:20:08.054 --> 01:20:11.057
JOHN: The colonel told me that you were
very helpful during your debriefing.

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:14.310
CURT: Just answered
a lot of questions, that's all.

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:19.232
When your mother died,

01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:22.485
the hardest thing I ever did
was to let go.

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:28.616
So I buried myself
in this insane job.

01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:32.119
Because of that...

01:20:32.119 --> 01:20:35.456
I haven't always been there
when you've needed me.

01:20:38.668 --> 01:20:40.378
Look, Son, I, <i>uh...</i>

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:48.135
I thought maybe we could take <i>a...</i>
couple weeks before Oklahoma City.

01:20:51.097 --> 01:20:52.223
Just the two of us.

01:20:53.099 --> 01:20:54.392
Spend some time together.

01:20:56.102 --> 01:20:57.436
We have a lot to talk about.

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:05.236
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Dad.

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:08.865
What's gonna happen to Julie?

01:21:12.118 --> 01:21:13.077
I don't know.

01:21:15.121 --> 01:21:16.747
She's part of Sinclair's project now.

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:25.506
John, Sinclair here has requested

01:21:25.506 --> 01:21:29.176
that your report on the Walker girl
be kept under wraps.

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:31.053
[man screaming]

01:21:31.721 --> 01:21:34.140
Look, Colonel, the fact
that she was cognitive

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:37.602
proves that the living dead
aren't just animated flesh.

01:21:38.436 --> 01:21:39.478
It proves they have an inner life.

01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:40.605
COLONEL: Well, that may be so, John, but--

01:21:40.605 --> 01:21:44.567
SINCLAIR: The objective of this program is to create
bio-weapons from these units.

01:21:45.318 --> 01:21:46.402
Let's not confuse the issue.

01:21:47.153 --> 01:21:48.571
Now, do you mind?
I have work to do.

01:21:50.615 --> 01:21:53.367
COLONEL: John, I've been ordered
to do as she says.

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:59.582
[zombies growling]

01:23:15.241 --> 01:23:17.994
[whimpering]
Julie?

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:38.931
You're Colonel Reynolds' son,
aren't you?

01:23:39.849 --> 01:23:42.226
Believe it or not, you're looking at the weapons system
of the future.

01:23:43.728 --> 01:23:44.562
The what?

01:23:45.271 --> 01:23:48.190
[drill]
Ahhhhh!

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.442
Ahhhhhh!

01:24:32.610 --> 01:24:34.487
Lock it off! Lock it off!

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:35.905
Lock it off!

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:44.121
That one is a prototype.

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:46.665
This one's going next.

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.001
You mean Julie?

01:24:49.293 --> 01:24:50.294
That's right.

01:24:50.294 --> 01:24:52.213
They're all gonna end up like that.

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:55.716
Bio-mechanical weapons
driven by meat batteries.

01:24:56.383 --> 01:24:57.968
Never have to be fed or recharged.

01:24:58.844 --> 01:25:00.346
They just keep going...

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:05.768
Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:12.024
What the hell is he doing here?

01:25:20.366 --> 01:25:21.909
Julie, Julie, it's okay.

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:31.210

I knew you'd never leave me.

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:34.356
Shoot!

01:26:34.732 --> 01:26:35.983
