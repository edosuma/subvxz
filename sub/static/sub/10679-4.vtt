WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:02.250
I know him. It's that bloke I tasered.

00:02.299 --> 00:05.250
- They let him out on bail yesterday.
- Look what they've done to Daryl.

00:05.299 --> 00:09.529
- This is the lads you let off with a caution.
- Come on through, I'm gonna nip this in the bud.

00:09.580 --> 00:11.570
- I will scream.
- You shouldn't have done it!

00:11.619 --> 00:13.609
We've got a bit of a
weirdo doing the rounds.

00:13.660 --> 00:16.289
He's killed three girls. You
need to be aware, all right?

00:16.338 --> 00:17.929
- Leonie, are you listening?
- Yeah.

00:17.980 --> 00:22.329
- Are we looking at the same killer?
- Yeah. Not as frenzied. But, yeah.

00:22.379 --> 00:24.530
You killed my mother, you filthy bitch!

00:24.579 --> 00:26.769
You're going to get what's coming to you!

00:26.820 --> 00:29.760
- Do you want to go for
a drink sometime? - OK.

00:31.379 --> 00:32.810
She is poison.

00:32.859 --> 00:34.850
She needs putting out
of her misery, that one.

00:34.899 --> 00:38.659
I know we try not to have
nasty thoughts, Frances, but...

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:55.380 --> 00:59.009
- It's very good of you to turn out in
the middle of the night. - It's fine.

00:59.060 --> 01:02.530
It's just... those other two didn't
seem to take it seriously at all.

01:02.579 --> 01:05.370
She's here, love. And
they were both women.

01:05.420 --> 01:09.090
They're Specials, part-timers,
If it's who I think it is.

01:09.140 --> 01:11.489
Course, my first thought
when she rang me was,

01:11.539 --> 01:12.849
"Well, what if it's him?"

01:12.900 --> 01:15.969
So why weren't they
thinking the same thing?

01:16.019 --> 01:18.170
Well, God knows.

01:18.219 --> 01:19.819
Hello, Leonie.

01:21.219 --> 01:22.810
He would have strangled her,

01:22.859 --> 01:24.569
if she hadn't managed to raise the alarm,

01:24.620 --> 01:27.010
and if this other lass hadn't
been just round the corner.

01:27.060 --> 01:28.930
Tell me about this other lass.

01:28.980 --> 01:32.289
Kelsey. She just lives up the
road. I can give you her number.

01:32.340 --> 01:33.849
It was her that rang 999.

01:33.900 --> 01:37.609
Have you got something I can write with?

01:37.659 --> 01:40.170
Leonie, listen, love, listen to me.

01:40.219 --> 01:43.370
You're doing really well,
you're being really brave.

01:45.460 --> 01:49.490
So what's going to happen now is
I'm going to take a few details...

01:49.539 --> 01:51.770
- Will this do?
- Ta.

01:51.819 --> 01:54.810
.. and then I'm going to take
you down to the station with me.

01:54.859 --> 01:57.530
You need to make a statement.

01:57.579 --> 02:00.290
Leonie, look at me.

02:00.340 --> 02:04.450
Annette can come with us if
you like. Would you like that?

02:04.500 --> 02:08.090
One of the officers... One of the
other officers, I can't do it,

02:08.139 --> 02:11.490
because I'm not on duty, but it'll
be a woman, it won't be a man,

02:11.539 --> 02:15.129
she'll need to go through the
early evidence kit with you...

02:15.180 --> 02:17.490
That's like your swabs and everything.

02:17.539 --> 02:19.370
.. and then we'll take
you over to Bradford.

02:19.420 --> 02:22.530
There's a proper unit there,
where they can look after you

02:22.579 --> 02:25.530
and someone'll see to you, a doctor.

02:25.579 --> 02:29.129
They'll make sure that you're
safe and you're comfortable.

02:29.180 --> 02:31.569
I've sat her on a plastic bag and then...

02:31.620 --> 02:33.620
I'm thinking evidence.

02:35.819 --> 02:38.610
Can you talk me through what's happened?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.860
I need to hear it from Leonie.

02:43.020 --> 02:44.539
Just...

02:46.259 --> 02:48.460
I were on Stoney Royd Lane...

02:50.979 --> 02:53.180
.. and there were three of us.

02:54.579 --> 02:57.129
And he come along in his van.

02:57.180 --> 03:00.169
And I said, I told him...

03:00.219 --> 03:02.370
"It's £5 with, and without, it's double."

03:02.419 --> 03:03.889
So he knew.

03:04.819 --> 03:07.409
And he said he were fine with that,

03:07.460 --> 03:11.770
so I got in and we went
down to the cricket club,

03:11.819 --> 03:13.460
the car park.

03:14.699 --> 03:18.379
- He stank, he'd been drinking.
- They all do.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.610
And then when he gets going, he
decides he wants to do it without.

03:23.659 --> 03:25.930
They do that.

03:25.979 --> 03:29.500
So I said, "You have to pay me up front."

03:31.819 --> 03:35.210
And he goes, "I'll pay you after,"
but they only ever say that

03:35.259 --> 03:37.620
when they haven't enough.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.889
I said, "Well, it's not happening, then."

03:44.579 --> 03:48.579
But... you know... And
I couldn't stop him.

03:51.659 --> 03:54.699
I was struggling but then he
had his hand on my throat.

03:58.259 --> 04:01.569
He's pressing down on me,
he's inside me without a condom

04:01.620 --> 04:03.419
and I can't breathe.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.729
And he's a big fella and I can
feel meself going red in t'face.

04:09.780 --> 04:13.210
And he goes, "If you don't stop
wriggling, I'm going to shove

04:13.259 --> 04:15.050
"a broken bottle up you."

04:15.099 --> 04:18.740
Oh... Did he indeed?

04:25.540 --> 04:29.889
God knows how, I managed to press
my stiletto into t'steering wheel

04:29.939 --> 04:32.170
and it were more by luck than management,

04:32.220 --> 04:34.290
but it made the horn go...

04:35.259 --> 04:37.600
.. and that shocked the bastard.

04:39.220 --> 04:40.689
Shocked me.

04:44.180 --> 04:46.810
Then... he smacked me in the
face and he's spitting and

04:46.860 --> 04:50.129
calling me all the usual, and
he's going, "Get out, get out!"

04:50.180 --> 04:52.810
- like nasty, and...
- And that's when Kelsey turned up.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.449
She offered to go to t'hospital
with her but these two...

04:55.500 --> 04:57.610
And he's just driven off, then, or what?

04:57.659 --> 04:59.810
Yeah, when Kelsey started
banging on t'window.

04:59.860 --> 05:03.810
These two uniforms, or specials,
whatever, they're saying,

05:03.860 --> 05:06.410
"No, we're not going to
take you, we'll take her

05:06.459 --> 05:08.860
"because we're not a taxi service."

05:10.060 --> 05:12.370
- Did you tell them what he'd said to you?
- They didn't ask.

05:12.420 --> 05:14.889
They didn't take a statement,
they didn't write owt down.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.290
Basically they're saying,

05:16.339 --> 05:19.639
"Oh, right, love, has he not
paid you, then? Boo-hoo."

05:20.699 --> 05:24.889
So did either of you... of
you or Kelsey recognise him?

05:24.939 --> 05:27.480
Is he someone you've been with before?

05:29.060 --> 05:30.769
No, but she's got his number.

05:30.819 --> 05:33.220
His registration number. Show her.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.250
What sort of vehicle did you say it was?

05:41.300 --> 05:43.300
- A white van.
- A van.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.930
I'm going to take a photo
of your arm on my phone

05:49.980 --> 05:52.850
and then I'm going to take you
down to the station in my car,

05:52.899 --> 05:55.329
it's just outside, 15 yards down the road.

05:55.379 --> 05:58.569
- Can you manage that?
- It won't be...

05:58.620 --> 06:00.610
It won't be what, love?

06:00.660 --> 06:02.250
Taking swabs. It won't be them two?

06:02.300 --> 06:04.610
It's not going to be those
two that just dumped her

06:04.660 --> 06:06.649
on the doorstep at the hospital, and said,

06:06.699 --> 06:08.649
"If you're still insisting in the morning

06:08.699 --> 06:11.490
"you've been raped, come
back and report it, then"?

06:11.540 --> 06:15.300
No. No, it won't be them two, Leonie.

06:16.379 --> 06:18.579
I'll be dealing with them two.

- Shall I tell you what I'VE been doing?

07:05.660 --> 07:08.410
I've just briefed the night crew
on an arrest strategy for a fella

07:08.459 --> 07:10.250
that's raped and assaulted a 19-year-old.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.009
They've just gone to pick him up just now.

07:12.060 --> 07:13.930
She's gone off to the
OPAL Unit in Bradford,

07:13.980 --> 07:16.449
so we can get her properly
examined, and now I'm going to wake

07:16.500 --> 07:17.850
Mr Shepherd up and tell him I think

07:17.899 --> 07:20.569
he might want to look at this bloke
because he might -- just might --

07:20.620 --> 07:23.689
- be the twisted little bastard that's
been killing prostitutes. - Really?

07:23.740 --> 07:25.730
So what I want to know
from you is... Yes, really.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.569
What I REALLY want to know from you is,

07:27.620 --> 07:30.449
when you were called out to assist
her, why you did the absolute

07:30.500 --> 07:32.970
minimum required and why her
friend's ringing me at home

07:33.019 --> 07:36.610
at four o'clock in the morning to
come out and do your job for you.

07:36.659 --> 07:39.329
- We were just...
- You dropped her at the hospital doors.

07:39.379 --> 07:41.409
You didn't even see her
inside. She didn't go in

07:41.459 --> 07:43.930
after you'd left. She was too
upset, she was too frightened.

07:43.980 --> 07:46.930
She stood in the cold for an
hour-and-a-half, frozen rigid,

07:46.980 --> 07:48.529
waiting for a bus to get home.

07:48.579 --> 07:51.490
We were always told to take anything
they said with a pinch of salt,

07:51.540 --> 07:54.250
and it's been a busy night.
We're only just on our meal break

07:54.300 --> 07:57.050
- and we're knocking off in an hour.
- "They"? Prostitutes?

07:57.100 --> 07:59.409
We're talking about a
vulnerable 19-year-old.

07:59.459 --> 08:01.529
Her face was bruised,
her neck was bruised.

08:01.579 --> 08:03.449
- That ain't someone crying wolf.
- It was dark.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.970
You didn't even take a
statement. I'm just ignoring that.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.959
No, I'm not. You've got
a torch, haven't you?!

08:09.939 --> 08:11.970
I've had a go at the night
sergeant for sending

08:12.019 --> 08:14.769
a couple of hobby-bobbies out on
a job that needed somebody with

08:14.819 --> 08:17.170
the proper skill set and a
bit more wool on their backs.

08:17.220 --> 08:19.610
And I know it's been a busy
night but, for God's sakes,

08:19.660 --> 08:22.009
there's somebody out there
targeting prostitutes.

08:22.060 --> 08:23.050
Did you not think?

08:23.100 --> 08:26.490
You know, you lot, you come in
and you give us four hours a week,

08:26.540 --> 08:28.490
if we're lucky. If you can be bothered.

08:28.540 --> 08:30.930
The least you could do when
you get here is engage.

08:30.980 --> 08:32.820
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.169
Right. I'm going home for 40 minutes

08:37.220 --> 08:38.970
to say happy birthday to my grandson,

08:39.019 --> 08:42.090
get changed, then straight back here
in time for the eight o'clock shift.

08:42.139 --> 08:44.649
I'm not reporting you to
professional standards,

08:44.700 --> 08:46.850
although God knows why
-- I should be doing.

08:46.899 --> 08:49.570
But, please, just learn something from it.

08:49.620 --> 08:52.490
You'll need to make
statements. Both of you.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.289
Where've you been?

09:51.340 --> 09:53.690
Oh, I got a phone call.
This lass got raped.

09:53.740 --> 09:57.090
- What lass?
- 19-year-old, down in Sowerby Bridge.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.409
Well, what were the night crew doing?

09:59.460 --> 10:02.419
Oh, it's long, it's complicated.

10:03.539 --> 10:05.330
What you doing up?

10:05.379 --> 10:09.019
Oh, I couldn't sleep. And
then I heard you set off.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.330
I thought you'd gone up to Heptonstall

10:13.379 --> 10:15.049
to be with Becky.

10:15.820 --> 10:16.980
No.

10:19.899 --> 10:21.100
No.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.210
I always think about you on his birthday.

10:27.379 --> 10:29.340
I know you do.

10:30.539 --> 10:32.409
We'll get through it.

10:33.580 --> 10:34.850
We'll get through today

10:34.899 --> 10:37.610
and then we'll get through
the next few weeks.

10:37.659 --> 10:39.129
And then...

10:41.740 --> 10:43.610
Big smiles.

10:43.659 --> 10:45.259
Big smiles.

10:46.460 --> 10:50.210
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

10:50.259 --> 10:53.610
- Shut up! Neighbours'll

10:53.659 --> 10:55.169
Are you going to open the others?

10:55.220 --> 10:58.169
Or are you just going to spend the
rest of your life balancing on that?

10:58.220 --> 11:01.250
- Can I go to school on it? - Uphill?
Does that work? - It's not ALL uphill.

11:01.299 --> 11:03.889
No. If you're going in the
opposite direction, it's downhill.

11:03.940 --> 11:05.850
Stop trying to blind
everybody with science.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.370
Going to open your cards? They
might be stashed with moolah.

11:08.419 --> 11:11.210
- Who's this from again? - I've no idea,
I told you. It was on the doorstep,

11:11.259 --> 11:13.409
- 6:30 this morning.
- It's big. I can tell you that much.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.769
Let's get ripping, I've got
to go to work in five minutes.

11:15.820 --> 11:18.690
- This is from me.
- I know what that is.

11:18.740 --> 11:22.129
The sort you asked for. Took me
best part of a week to wrap that up

11:22.179 --> 11:24.570
and I got through about
16 rolls of Sellotape.

11:24.620 --> 11:25.970
Who's this one from again, Gran?

11:26.019 --> 11:29.539
I've just said, I don't
know, it was on the doorstep.

11:31.139 --> 11:33.019
Wahey! Rip it!

11:35.379 --> 11:37.049
- Wow.
- Blimey!

11:37.100 --> 11:39.450
Oh, my God! Look at that. I
think that might be from me.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.169
- Is it?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:41.220 --> 11:43.570
I got up early specially
to go and put it outside.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.490
- He's lying.
- Actually, I think it might be FOR me.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.129
I think they've put the wrong

11:48.179 --> 11:51.250
name on by mistake. I think they've
got our birthdays mixed up.

11:51.299 --> 11:54.330
That's... whoa. Who's it from?

11:54.379 --> 11:56.730
I'm going to start speaking Urdu soon,

11:56.779 --> 11:58.769
then people might understand me better.

11:58.820 --> 12:01.570
- We don't know.
- Calm down, dear.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.450
Wasn't there a card with it?

12:03.500 --> 12:06.529
No. Not unless next door's cat's had it.

12:06.580 --> 12:09.649
You know, that's about, like,
150 quid's worth of kit, that.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.840
Nevison. Nevison Gallagher.

12:15.059 --> 12:17.570
Sean Balmforth. Date of birth -- 17.11.85.

12:17.620 --> 12:19.330
29 years old.

12:19.379 --> 12:23.210
Address -- 34 Burley Road, Illingworth.

12:23.259 --> 12:26.409
He's got a string of convictions and
he's on the Sex Offender's Register.

12:26.460 --> 12:29.409
Unlawful sexual intercourse
with a 14-year-old.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.009
That was ten years ago.

12:31.059 --> 12:33.889
His van's been seized in
connection with the assault

12:33.940 --> 12:35.850
and rape of this girl in the early hours.

12:35.899 --> 12:38.850
Forensics are across it,
I've spoken to the supervisor

12:38.899 --> 12:41.370
and they're aware we're looking
at him for other things.

12:41.419 --> 12:43.690
On an initial visual
inspection they've told me

12:43.740 --> 12:45.370
they've found rope in the back.

12:45.419 --> 12:48.210
Nylon rope. Three separate lengths.

12:48.259 --> 12:50.929
There's also a couple of bags of
rubbish in there, containing --

12:50.980 --> 12:53.330
amongst other things --
a number of beer bottles,

12:53.379 --> 12:56.769
some of which are of the same brand
as those found at the site where

12:56.820 --> 12:59.570
Ana Vasalescu was found and
where Vicky Fleming was found.

12:59.620 --> 13:01.250
So,

13:01.299 --> 13:03.889
once they've charged him over
this business this morning

13:03.940 --> 13:06.730
we'll step in and see if he'd like
to have a conversation with us.

13:06.779 --> 13:08.929
Arresting him?

13:08.980 --> 13:10.889
I'll run everything past the CPS

13:10.940 --> 13:14.529
and, depending on what else we
dig up between now and then...

13:14.580 --> 13:16.450
yeah. We've got reasonable grounds.

13:16.500 --> 13:20.210
I've got POLSA going through his
house on a Section 18, we'll get

13:20.259 --> 13:21.730
his phone back from the OPAL Unit

13:21.779 --> 13:23.889
as soon as they've got
what they want from it.

13:23.940 --> 13:27.090
Let's start tracking his movements
over the last five months,

13:27.139 --> 13:28.210
working backwards.

13:28.259 --> 13:31.570
I want to know everything there
is to know about this fella.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.090
I want a list of all his contacts,
his family, his friends,

13:34.139 --> 13:36.570
I want a picture of his
daily routine, his lifestyle,

13:36.620 --> 13:37.970
any employment,

13:38.019 --> 13:41.289
any access to other vehicles
besides this one we've seized.

13:41.340 --> 13:46.129
Bank details, where's he drawn money
out and when? John, Steve, Jodie,

13:46.179 --> 13:48.570
can we talk through an
interview strategy in my office

13:48.620 --> 13:51.980
in a minute? John, have you got a second?

13:54.500 --> 13:58.539
Telecoms found your name and number
in Vicky Fleming's mobile phone.

14:02.539 --> 14:06.169
Do you know? I had a funny
feeling. I wasn't certain.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.889
But...

14:07.940 --> 14:09.889
two years, eighteen months since?

14:09.940 --> 14:12.529
I was working on a fraud investigation up

14:12.580 --> 14:16.450
at the building society and she was...

14:16.500 --> 14:18.289
she was the point of contact.

14:18.340 --> 14:22.570
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd
have given her my number.

14:22.620 --> 14:23.610
Blimey.

14:23.659 --> 14:26.370
Mind you, who haven't I given
my number to over the years?

14:26.419 --> 14:29.330
I don't think I spoke to
her more than once or twice.

14:29.379 --> 14:31.210
You should have said.

14:31.259 --> 14:34.009
I wasn't convinced it was her.

14:34.059 --> 14:37.250
I couldn't have told you her name
if you'd been asking me to remember.

14:37.299 --> 14:40.210
Maybe if she'd been working
at the building society now

14:40.259 --> 14:42.330
it would have rung a bell but...

14:42.379 --> 14:45.610
So that's the only contact
you've ever had with her?

14:45.659 --> 14:48.210
Yeah, yeah.

14:48.259 --> 14:52.129
OK. Can you make a statement to
that effect and then it's covered?

14:52.179 --> 14:55.649
Sure. So do you think this is the fella?

14:55.700 --> 14:57.690
You know as much as me at the minute.

14:57.740 --> 15:01.970
John, is everything all right
at home? I keep meaning to ask.

15:02.019 --> 15:07.049
Yeah. Well, you know. Slings and arrows.

15:07.100 --> 15:10.169
- Well, you know this door's
always open, don't you? - Yeah.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.250
I mean, except when it's shut.

15:12.299 --> 15:14.169
Sure.

15:14.220 --> 15:17.370
Hey, how was your date with
your little job-pissed PCSO?

15:17.419 --> 15:19.940
What date? What date?

15:24.820 --> 15:26.210
Ann!

15:26.259 --> 15:28.259
Oh, somebody's in bother.

15:30.740 --> 15:32.970
You all right, love?
You're pale. You're quiet.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.529
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

15:34.580 --> 15:37.610
I'm just... I'm wondering
if I'm starting with flu.

15:37.659 --> 15:39.370
Right. Well, don't overdo it.

15:39.419 --> 15:42.769
If you start to feel like crap,
you need to be at home. Yeah?

15:42.820 --> 15:44.210
Yeah, yeah.

15:44.259 --> 15:46.289
- Your dad knows Sean
Balmforth, doesn't he? - Who?

15:46.340 --> 15:50.250
This fella we picked up last
night. He works for your dad.

15:50.299 --> 15:51.929
Does he? Don't know.

15:51.980 --> 15:54.889
I don't know half the
people that work for me dad.

15:54.940 --> 15:57.250
You don't know anything
about what he's like, then?

15:57.299 --> 15:59.970
- Ask me dad.
- Oh, they'll interview him, that lot.

16:00.019 --> 16:03.519
I just thought you might know
him, I was just being nosey.

16:08.580 --> 16:11.850
Ah, my two favourite women in uniform.

16:11.899 --> 16:14.889
No, I'm talking to you. Singing
your praises upstairs this morning,

16:14.940 --> 16:17.610
Mr Shepherd -- good
old-fashioned police work,

16:17.659 --> 16:19.169
picking up this fella last night.

16:19.220 --> 16:22.370
And you, identifying
Vicky Fleming last week.

16:22.419 --> 16:24.889
You both made me look really
good in there today. Well done.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.610
It's the only reason I do anything
is to make you look good, Sir.

16:27.659 --> 16:29.529
And not a hint of
sarcasm(!) Oh! As well...

16:29.580 --> 16:32.970
I had a phone call from HMIT
last night. Goran Dragovic,

16:33.019 --> 16:34.929
death of. They are now
pursuing it as murder,

16:34.980 --> 16:37.690
- not suicide. - Really?
- Yup. - Really?!

16:37.740 --> 16:39.490
Is that that fella we found hanged?

16:39.539 --> 16:43.210
Yeah. So, who're they
pursuing, then? The Knezevics?

16:43.259 --> 16:44.730
Well, wouldn't that be lovely?

16:44.779 --> 16:47.009
To actually pin something
on one of the Knezevics.

16:47.059 --> 16:49.490
They won't have got their
own hands mucky, of course.

16:49.539 --> 16:50.690
But, you know...

16:50.740 --> 16:53.570
Anything we can do to disrupt their
operations and get that bit closer.

16:53.620 --> 16:56.370
Every little helps. Chipping away.

16:56.419 --> 16:58.960
Anyway, yeah, well done, both of you.

17:01.259 --> 17:02.850
Who are the Knezevics?

17:02.899 --> 17:05.809
Oh, they're... You know how
New Jersey has the Sopranos?

17:05.858 --> 17:08.450
Well, Halifax has the Knezevics.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.970
And they ain't no choirboys either.

17:11.019 --> 17:12.410
How's Ilinka?

17:12.460 --> 17:15.210
Fine. I wish she'd make her
mind up to go home, though.

17:15.259 --> 17:17.890
I'm sick of sleeping in that conservatory.

17:17.940 --> 17:19.130
You're mad.

17:19.180 --> 17:22.170
You and your dad, or just your
dad, he didn't send our Ryan

17:22.220 --> 17:25.848
a ridiculously expensive birthday
present this morning, did he?

17:25.900 --> 17:27.700
Not that I know of.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.369
You do realise it's ten to nine?

17:34.420 --> 17:35.569
No, it's not.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.809
- Ooh!
- Are you dropping him off?

17:37.859 --> 17:40.859
Yeah, yeah. Come on,
turn it off. Ryan, off.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.779
Ryan, Ry... I'm switching it off.

17:47.299 --> 17:49.250
Why do I have to go to
school on my birthday?

17:49.299 --> 17:51.089
You're going to be LATE on your birthday.

17:51.140 --> 17:53.730
Come on. You can play with it
as much as you want at tea-time.

17:53.779 --> 17:56.650
- Have a nice day.
- Where's me dinner gone?

17:58.299 --> 18:02.700
- Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye.

18:36.099 --> 18:37.970
What a piece of shit.

18:52.099 --> 18:53.809
- Here he is, look.
- Y'all right, Flash?

18:53.859 --> 18:56.049
What were you doing
grassing us up to t'police?

18:56.099 --> 18:57.450
We were only having a bit of fun,

18:57.500 --> 18:59.650
no reason to grass us
up to the 5-0, is there?

18:59.700 --> 19:02.529
- We're your mates.
- The only mates you'll ever have.

19:02.579 --> 19:04.849
- Oops! - Nice trip, love?
- Go on, pick your stuff up.

19:04.900 --> 19:08.690
He don't say much, does he?
You don't say much, Flash.

19:08.740 --> 19:11.569
Yeah, like, how about, "Sorry,
lads, sorry for grassing you up to

19:11.619 --> 19:14.410
"the feds, sorry for being
such a sad little twat,

19:14.460 --> 19:17.490
"such a sad little mummy's boy twat."

19:17.539 --> 19:20.609
- Is it true you shag your
own mother, Flash? - Does he?!

19:20.660 --> 19:24.089
He don't want to, like, but she
makes him because she's a whore.

19:24.140 --> 19:25.490
I heard he shags sheep.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.650
He does that and all but
can't tell t'difference

19:27.700 --> 19:29.769
- up there in the dark, eh?
- Can you not? Can he not?

19:29.819 --> 19:31.130
Can you not, Flash?

19:31.180 --> 19:32.730
Argh!

19:32.779 --> 19:34.730
- What you doing? - You
fucking idiot! - Whoa!

19:34.779 --> 19:37.539
Relax, Flash! Put it down!

19:40.259 --> 19:41.930
Just put it down!

19:59.460 --> 20:00.900
Afternoon.

20:02.380 --> 20:03.920
He's in here.

20:12.740 --> 20:15.730
How are you doing there, Daryl?

20:15.779 --> 20:18.130
I don't know what's
happened exactly, but...

20:18.180 --> 20:21.250
I think Daryl knows why
we're here. Don't you, Daryl?

20:21.299 --> 20:23.849
- Hmm?
- I know he gets provoked.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.970
They might have all
been charged, that lot,

20:26.019 --> 20:28.450
but they're all out on bail
-- every one of them --

20:28.500 --> 20:31.490
and he still has to go down there
and buy his tobacco and his filters.

20:31.539 --> 20:34.450
Let's turn this telly off,
Daryl. Come on, this is serious.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.890
If he has done something,

20:35.940 --> 20:37.730
it can't be worse than
what they've done to him.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.049
So you know what's happened
this morning, Daryl?

20:40.099 --> 20:43.170
Yeah? We've had a report you've
been involved in an altercation,

20:43.220 --> 20:45.890
and you've been to your car and
you've pulled out a lump hammer.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.890
- Has he?
- And you've attacked people

20:47.940 --> 20:50.890
and, you know, that's an
arrestable offence, isn't it?

20:50.940 --> 20:53.009
Having an offensive
weapon in a public place.

20:53.059 --> 20:55.049
- He'd never...
- It's all on CCTV.

20:55.099 --> 20:57.490
So, Daryl, I'm arresting
you. Do you understand?

20:57.539 --> 20:58.930
You do not have to say anything,

20:58.980 --> 21:01.009
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention

21:01.059 --> 21:03.569
when questioned something which
you later rely on in court.

21:03.619 --> 21:05.529
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.

21:05.579 --> 21:08.609
- Could you stand up, please?
- They start it. Every time.

21:08.660 --> 21:11.490
Yeah, I know, but what's
happened has happened now,

21:11.539 --> 21:14.170
and you can put your side of it
across when you're interviewed,

21:14.220 --> 21:16.650
so come on, stand up. Let's
get it over with for you.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.730
- Where are you taking him?
- Halifax.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.490
Shall I follow on in my car?

21:20.539 --> 21:22.970
I wouldn't. You'll only be
sat outside for hours waiting.

21:23.019 --> 21:25.490
- He needs someone with him.
- You won't be allowed in with him.

21:25.539 --> 21:27.809
- Why?
- Because he's under arrest.

21:27.859 --> 21:29.769
Well, how long will he be?

21:29.819 --> 21:32.650
How long is a piece of string?

21:32.700 --> 21:35.009
Well, what am I supposed to do?

21:35.059 --> 21:37.289
I'll get someone to ring
you to come and pick him up

21:37.339 --> 21:41.250
when we're done with him.
Where's your car keys, Daryl?

21:41.299 --> 21:42.660
Here.

21:52.380 --> 21:54.920
It's on t'floor in the passenger seat.

22:03.059 --> 22:06.250
9242, I've got a 112 for
possession of an offensive weapon.

22:06.299 --> 22:08.769
I'm on my way with him.

22:08.819 --> 22:11.009
OK, Sean, you do not have to say anything,

22:11.059 --> 22:13.210
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention now

22:13.259 --> 22:15.089
something which you
later rely on in court.

22:15.140 --> 22:17.609
Anything you do say will
be given in evidence.

22:17.660 --> 22:21.690
You are charged that on 12th
September 2015 in Sowerby Bridge,

22:21.740 --> 22:23.049
that you intentionally

22:23.099 --> 22:25.130
penetrated the vagina of
a woman with your penis

22:25.180 --> 22:26.690
when she did not consent

22:26.740 --> 22:29.329
and you did not reasonably
believe that she was consenting,

22:29.380 --> 22:33.490
contrary to section one of
the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

22:33.539 --> 22:36.609
You are also charged
on 12th September 2015,

22:36.660 --> 22:37.930
in Sowerby Bridge,

22:37.980 --> 22:40.890
that you assaulted the same woman,
causing her Actual Bodily Harm,

22:40.940 --> 22:42.369
contrary to Section 47 of

22:42.420 --> 22:45.250
the Offences Against The Person Act 1861.

22:45.299 --> 22:47.970
Have you anything you'd like to say?

22:48.019 --> 22:50.980
I paid her. She's a prostitute.

22:51.980 --> 22:54.250
Just wait there for me, please.

22:57.859 --> 23:01.690
Hello, Sean. I'm Detective
Inspector Shackleton, HMET,

23:01.740 --> 23:04.329
and I'm arresting you on
suspicion of the murder

23:04.380 --> 23:08.970
of Ana Vasalescu, Aurelija Petrovic,
Lynn Dewhurst and Victoria Fleming.

23:09.019 --> 23:11.130
- You what?
- You do not have to say anything

23:11.180 --> 23:13.490
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention...

23:13.539 --> 23:14.690
What are you talking about?

23:14.740 --> 23:16.650
.. something which you
later rely on in court.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.970
- No, no... - Anything you do
say may be given in evidence.

23:19.019 --> 23:21.490
- You can't fit me up for everything!
- You're going back to

23:21.539 --> 23:23.930
- your cell now, Sean...
- Do something! Say something!

23:23.980 --> 23:26.609
- You're going back to your cell...
- I'm not going back in my cell.

23:26.660 --> 23:28.650
- I'm going home!
- I'm going to have a conversation

23:28.700 --> 23:31.049
- with your solicitor, OK?
- No, it's not O-shitting-K!

23:31.099 --> 23:34.650
I don't know who them people
are! Who are they? Who are they?

23:34.700 --> 23:37.690
Who are they?!

23:37.740 --> 23:41.170
This Daryl lad's kicking off downstairs.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.170
He won't have his DNA or
his fingerprints done.

23:43.220 --> 23:45.809
They thought you might like to
have a crack at persuading him

23:45.859 --> 23:47.730
before they force him.

23:51.779 --> 23:54.289
- No, I don't want to! - All right,
are you ready? - No! Get away...

23:54.339 --> 23:56.369
Now, then, Daryl, why
aren't you co-operating?

23:56.420 --> 23:58.970
You said you were going to deal
with them and nip it in the bud.

23:59.019 --> 24:01.210
I shouldn't even be here.

24:01.259 --> 24:03.609
They were arrested and charged
and they'll be up in court

24:03.660 --> 24:06.210
in the next few weeks, and I'll
go there and speak to them again

24:06.259 --> 24:07.769
but, with the best will in the world,

24:07.819 --> 24:09.009
there's only so much we can do

24:09.059 --> 24:11.170
and, frankly, this silly
business doesn't help --

24:11.220 --> 24:13.809
- it just perpetuates the bad
feeling. - They're animals. - Yup.

24:13.859 --> 24:16.930
They shouldn't be allowed to walk,
allowed to exist, to breathe...

24:16.980 --> 24:18.529
And now you've gone and shattered

24:18.579 --> 24:20.690
one of their collar
bones with a lump hammer.

24:20.740 --> 24:23.170
Are you going to let me do this?

24:23.220 --> 24:24.890
It doesn't hurt.

24:44.059 --> 24:46.130
We're back!

24:46.180 --> 24:48.210
There's a card on the mantelpiece, Ryan!

24:48.259 --> 24:50.200
I found it in that box.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.930
Who's it from?

24:52.980 --> 24:57.009
I didn't open it -- it
wasn't addressed to me.

24:57.059 --> 24:58.650
Do you want some tea?

24:58.700 --> 24:59.900
Yeah.

25:02.619 --> 25:05.089
Gran, you race that one
and I'll race this one.

25:05.140 --> 25:07.410
Are you going to open this
card and see who it's from?

25:07.460 --> 25:09.569
Cos, whoever it is, I
think you need to send them

25:09.619 --> 25:11.410
a note to say a very big
thank-you, don't you?

25:11.460 --> 25:13.170
Yeah, you open it.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.809
It's not addressed to me.

25:14.859 --> 25:16.329
I'm giving you permission.

25:16.380 --> 25:18.130
Come on, hurry up, I'm going to beat you.

25:18.180 --> 25:21.369
There's a year's supply of
birthday cake in the kitchen,

25:21.420 --> 25:23.420
if anybody's interested.

25:30.940 --> 25:33.130
- Right, get that dismantled, now.
- What are you doing?

25:33.180 --> 25:34.930
- What are you doing?
- What's up, Catherine?

25:34.980 --> 25:38.569
Get it back in the box. In
the bin. Straight in the bin!

25:38.619 --> 25:40.690
We can't keep it, I'm sorry.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.609
- Bastard. - Why not? What are you
on about? - The bastard. - Oh, my God.

25:43.660 --> 25:45.970
- What's up? - Your granny's
right, we can't keep it.

25:46.019 --> 25:48.329
What do you mean "we"?
It's not yours, it's mine!

25:48.380 --> 25:50.609
Well, it's either him
or some nasty bastard

25:50.660 --> 25:53.329
- playing stupid, dumb, little games.
- What is? What is?

25:53.380 --> 25:56.940
- It's from your dad. - Yeah,
just get a bin bag. - NO! - Sorry.

25:58.539 --> 26:01.130
You can't throw away my things! It's mine!

26:01.180 --> 26:03.809
He's not allowed to have any
contact with you. This is illegal.

26:03.859 --> 26:05.329
It's bad, it's wrong, it's evil...

26:05.380 --> 26:07.569
- He's trying to mess about with us!
- It's a Scalextric!

26:07.619 --> 26:09.769
- Yeah, exactly!
- She's mental.

26:09.819 --> 26:12.130
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I am mental.

26:12.180 --> 26:14.009
I am mental when it comes to that bastard.

26:14.059 --> 26:17.210
Look, look, he can't have put
it there himself, can he?

26:17.259 --> 26:19.930
- No. No. No...
- We'd know about it if he'd escaped.

26:19.980 --> 26:21.890
Yeah, but someone, some, some...

26:21.940 --> 26:25.730
- some twisted little git has done it for him.
- You're not binning it!

26:25.779 --> 26:28.809
- I'll buy you a new one.
- I want this one! - No, no, no way.

26:28.859 --> 26:31.329
I'll buy you another one, I'll
buy you one exactly like it.

26:31.380 --> 26:33.329
Why? You can't stop him sending me things.

26:33.380 --> 26:36.009
No! Ryan! I can! You see, this
is the man that terrified you,

26:36.059 --> 26:38.210
that traumatised you, that
poured petrol over you,

26:38.259 --> 26:40.890
that put me in hospital for four weeks,

26:40.940 --> 26:43.250
that murdered Kirsten...

26:43.299 --> 26:45.009
See? This is what he wants!

26:45.059 --> 26:48.359
He wants you and me shouting.
He wants you to hate me!

26:56.779 --> 26:59.769
So, as you'll understand from
the disclosures we've made to

26:59.819 --> 27:01.250
your solicitor, Sean,

27:01.299 --> 27:04.650
we are investigating the
deaths of four women --

27:04.700 --> 27:10.410
Ana Vasalescu, Aurelija Petrovic,
Lynn Dewhurst and Victoria Fleming.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.970
Sean's prepared a statement,
if I could read it out.

27:13.019 --> 27:15.650
Oh, please do.

27:15.700 --> 27:18.490
"I have been asked to account for
my whereabouts at four different

27:18.539 --> 27:20.690
"periods of time across several days.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.930
"I cannot, at this moment in
time, verify my exact whereabouts

27:23.980 --> 27:26.849
"on any of the dates and times
in question, particularly

27:26.900 --> 27:30.650
"the first three, as they are
all some considerable time ago,

27:30.700 --> 27:34.009
"but I would like to state clearly
that I do not know Ana Vasalescu,

27:34.059 --> 27:38.289
"Aurelia Petrovic, Lynn
Dewhurst or Victoria Fleming,

27:38.339 --> 27:39.650
"and, to my knowledge,

27:39.700 --> 27:43.400
"have never met or come into
contact with them in the past."

27:45.019 --> 27:47.210
OK. That's very helpful, Sean,

27:47.259 --> 27:51.130
but we do still need to ask
you some questions, OK?

27:51.180 --> 27:52.700
No comment.

28:02.579 --> 28:04.210
I shouldn't have said anything.

28:04.259 --> 28:06.890
I should have just got rid of the card.

28:06.940 --> 28:08.490
He'd never have said anything.

28:08.539 --> 28:11.089
He wasn't the least bit
interested in who it was from.

28:11.140 --> 28:13.569
I should have just said
Nevison and squared it

28:13.619 --> 28:17.619
with Nevison -- he'd not have minded.
He'd have been pleased to help.

28:18.819 --> 28:21.049
You did the right thing.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.640
I think Ryan's realised that himself.

28:26.299 --> 28:28.930
Insidious bastard. Who's
he got doing that for him?

28:28.980 --> 28:30.970
We don't know, do we?

28:31.019 --> 28:34.579
We don't know that it's not
just some random nasty sod.

28:36.059 --> 28:38.609
Well, it's someone who knows
us, or else why would they know

28:38.660 --> 28:40.529
when his birthday is?

28:44.019 --> 28:46.220
We're going round in circles.

28:48.900 --> 28:50.890
Could you not just take
it to a charity shop

28:50.940 --> 28:52.329
rather than put it in the bin?

28:52.380 --> 28:56.130
No, I'm taking it to work --
the card, the wrapping, the box.

28:56.180 --> 28:58.490
See if I can't persuade
Mike to send it all off for

28:58.539 --> 29:01.569
ninhydrin testing -- see if we
can't get some fingerprints.

29:01.619 --> 29:04.160
It's a sick trick, whoever's done it.

29:05.539 --> 29:08.250
Never goes away, does it?

29:08.299 --> 29:10.299
He'll never go away.

29:11.859 --> 29:13.529
Everything all right?

29:13.579 --> 29:17.140
He's fine. He wants you
to go up and kiss him.

29:24.019 --> 29:25.569
'Currently being questioned

29:25.619 --> 29:28.490
- 'but no charges have been
brought as yet...' - Sorry.

29:28.539 --> 29:31.289
- 'This is a huge breakthrough...'
- Is she all right?

29:31.339 --> 29:34.529
Yeah. It's just...

29:34.579 --> 29:39.700
you know, such an odd
situation we're in with him.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.930
'.. Investigation, that they will
bring the offender to justice.'

29:44.980 --> 29:47.650
They've got someone for those
murders, by the look of it.

29:47.700 --> 29:50.970
Yep. Guess who got him arrested.

29:51.019 --> 29:53.130
She didn't?

29:53.180 --> 29:55.210
Have they charged him?

29:55.259 --> 29:59.170
No, not yet. I think they're
still questioning him.

29:59.220 --> 30:02.009
'A breakthrough for the detectives
working on the spate of murders

30:02.059 --> 30:03.970
'which has shocked the local community...'

30:04.019 --> 30:06.559
You are stopping tonight, aren't you?

30:27.259 --> 30:29.130
I knew Vicky Fleming.

30:31.140 --> 30:32.609
That woman.

30:34.420 --> 30:36.220
- Did you?
- Yeah.

30:37.660 --> 30:39.220
Yeah, um...

30:40.900 --> 30:43.410
.. it was her I was having the fling with.

30:43.460 --> 30:45.859
When everything went wrong for me.

30:46.660 --> 30:49.759
I used to work with her up
at the building society.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.049
What was she like?

30:54.099 --> 30:55.970
- Horrible.
- Really?

30:57.019 --> 30:58.460
Really?

31:02.500 --> 31:04.240
Are you all right?

31:06.539 --> 31:09.490
You won't tell Catherine, will you?

31:11.259 --> 31:12.500
No.

31:16.980 --> 31:18.339
Um...

31:20.539 --> 31:22.140
Uh...

31:38.500 --> 31:42.140
Urgh, I feel nauseated
just thinking about it.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.210
I thought I was in love with her.

31:45.259 --> 31:47.250
Well, I was... I was in love with her.

31:47.299 --> 31:49.500
It was just very short-lived.

31:52.779 --> 31:54.920
She... She was like this...

31:56.140 --> 31:58.140
She was very attractive.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.769
But eventually I realised

32:00.819 --> 32:03.759
that s-she was missing
something from up here.

32:05.660 --> 32:08.819
She kept going on, wanting me
to leave Sue and the kids and...

32:10.660 --> 32:12.259
.. I couldn't.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.299
Which really...

32:18.099 --> 32:21.460
I shouldn't have started it in
the first place, I know that.

32:23.019 --> 32:26.329
But I wasn't ready to
leave my family for her.

32:26.380 --> 32:32.009
And she kept... she kept pushing and
pushing and eventually I said no,

32:32.059 --> 32:33.930
I said no.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.490
If it came to the crunch I'd be
stopping with Sue and the kids

32:36.539 --> 32:39.259
and so she...

32:40.460 --> 32:42.259
She blackmailed me.

32:43.180 --> 32:44.650
Blackmailed?

32:45.779 --> 32:47.650
Yeah, for a few weeks.

32:49.140 --> 32:52.220
And then I said I wouldn't
pay her any more, I couldn't.

32:53.700 --> 32:57.019
She wanted 100 quid a week,
every week, or she'd tell Sue.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.089
I managed a few weeks, but then I...

33:01.140 --> 33:04.259
I thought, "I don't want
to live like this any more."

33:05.539 --> 33:08.059
So she...

33:10.339 --> 33:11.980
What, she what?

33:17.420 --> 33:19.019
Humiliated me.

33:26.819 --> 33:29.089
So at the minute, he's provided no alibis.

33:29.140 --> 33:30.569
Well, no useful alibis.

33:30.619 --> 33:32.329
We're building up a picture of a loner

33:32.380 --> 33:34.170
with a fairly chaotic sort of lifestyle.

33:34.220 --> 33:35.769
He was working recently as a driver,

33:35.819 --> 33:39.049
but he got sacked for drinking
and aggressive behaviour.

33:39.099 --> 33:40.890
The good news this
morning from Forensics --

33:40.940 --> 33:43.329
we've got strands of hair
matching that of Ana Vasalescu

33:43.380 --> 33:46.049
found in his van. Now,
he's denied knowing Ana,

33:46.099 --> 33:48.450
so let's see what he's
got to say about that.

33:48.500 --> 33:50.809
Telecoms -- Lynn Dewhurst's
mobile number was found

33:50.859 --> 33:53.529
in his contacts on his phone.
Again, he's denied knowing her,

33:53.579 --> 33:56.049
so let's see if he can enlighten us there.

33:56.099 --> 33:58.569
Then ANPR puts him, well, puts his van,

33:58.619 --> 34:00.650
within a mile of where
the bodies were found

34:00.700 --> 34:03.450
on the second and fourth
murders, Aurelia and Vicky.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.690
We've also got a witness
from a house-to-house

34:05.740 --> 34:07.410
reporting seeing a white van in the area

34:07.460 --> 34:08.889
around the time Ana was murdered.

34:08.940 --> 34:11.530
There was an appeal in the media
for the driver to come forward,

34:11.579 --> 34:14.090
no-one did. A white van was
also reported in the vicinity

34:14.139 --> 34:16.289
prior to Vicky Fleming's
flat being torched.

34:16.340 --> 34:18.929
So! Let's get back up to Halifax

34:18.980 --> 34:22.619
and see if he's got anything he'd
like to share with us today, hm?

34:25.099 --> 34:26.840
Am I overreacting?

34:27.980 --> 34:31.449
He tried to kill you, Catherine.
You're not overreacting.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.730
We'll send it all off for fingerprints

34:33.780 --> 34:35.650
and I'll ring the prison liaison officer

34:35.699 --> 34:37.210
to talk to someone at Gravesend.

34:37.260 --> 34:39.130
Let's find out who visits him,

34:39.179 --> 34:41.889
who he writes to, who
he has phone calls with.

34:41.940 --> 34:44.449
If he's behind it, he'll be dealt with.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.239
If it's a crank...

34:46.980 --> 34:49.730
.. it's a shame they've
got nothing better to do.

34:49.780 --> 34:52.050
Try not to let it get you down.

34:52.619 --> 34:55.489
- It's just this week,
it's always... - I know.

34:55.539 --> 34:58.940
- It's bad enough... - I know.
- .. without... - I know.

34:59.619 --> 35:01.059
I do know.

35:05.739 --> 35:08.289
Did you have a nice birthday yesterday?

35:08.340 --> 35:10.010
Yeah, it was OK.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.889
What did you get?

35:12.940 --> 35:15.570
Skateboard, elbow pads,

35:15.619 --> 35:17.500
knee pads.

35:18.780 --> 35:21.130
Helmet.

35:21.179 --> 35:23.329
New football.

35:23.380 --> 35:26.210
- 20 quid off me Uncle Daniel.
- Yep.

35:26.260 --> 35:28.849
30 quid off me grandad and me Auntie Ros.

35:28.900 --> 35:31.090
That's 50 quid.

35:31.139 --> 35:35.489
Winnie across made me a cake,
as well as me Auntie Clare.

35:35.539 --> 35:38.539
That's two cakes.

35:41.539 --> 35:45.059
I got a Scalextric, but
me granny put it in t'bin.

35:46.860 --> 35:48.219
Why?

35:49.460 --> 35:51.369
Because it were from me dad.

35:51.420 --> 35:52.900
Oh, no.

35:54.659 --> 35:57.250
And how do you feel about that?

35:57.300 --> 35:58.809
I dunno.

35:58.860 --> 36:01.090
I really wanted to play with it,

36:01.139 --> 36:03.889
but I could see how upset she was.

36:03.940 --> 36:06.539
Gosh, that must've cost a lot of money.

36:07.460 --> 36:10.400
Yeah, me Uncle Daniel
said it would have done.

36:11.139 --> 36:12.610
Perhaps, I don't know,

36:12.659 --> 36:15.650
it's his way of trying to
tell you all how sorry he is

36:15.699 --> 36:17.500
about what happened.

36:18.940 --> 36:21.489
- Do you think he is?
- Well, why else would he send it?

36:21.539 --> 36:24.449
I don't think they get
very much money in prison.

36:24.500 --> 36:27.300
It must have meant a
lot to him to do that.

36:28.659 --> 36:31.409
You know, after that
last conversation we had,

36:31.460 --> 36:32.690
I googled your dad.

36:32.739 --> 36:34.730
And I can't believe he was responsible

36:34.780 --> 36:37.530
for half the things he
was sent to prison for.

36:37.579 --> 36:38.940
Why?

36:40.300 --> 36:42.699
Because he had such a kind face.

36:49.940 --> 36:51.210
Here you are.

36:51.260 --> 36:52.610
Ta.

36:52.659 --> 36:55.090
I'm just suggesting that it's odd... John?

36:55.139 --> 36:56.690
No, thanks.

36:56.739 --> 36:59.289
.. for someone with such
a disorganised lifestyle

36:59.340 --> 37:00.969
who lives in chaos and squalor,

37:01.019 --> 37:04.130
spends half his life pissed
out of his tiny fucking skull,

37:04.179 --> 37:06.610
not to leave any DNA on any of the sites.

37:06.659 --> 37:09.570
Are we really believing that this
lad is that forensically aware?

37:09.619 --> 37:10.730
And that capable?

37:10.780 --> 37:13.889
You don't know these days. A lonely,
little, twisted mind like that

37:13.940 --> 37:17.449
has probably absorbed every
episode of CSI they've ever shot.

37:17.500 --> 37:21.530
Well, that aside, boss, what I still
can't square is Vicky Fleming.

37:21.579 --> 37:23.250
Vicky was not a prostitute.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.889
There are significant differences,

37:24.940 --> 37:27.329
and we've made this leap,
we've made an assumption...

37:27.380 --> 37:28.889
I'm ruling nothing out.

37:28.940 --> 37:31.730
He must have been in that flat.
He must have burnt that flat out.

37:31.780 --> 37:34.849
I don't care what the fire
service says, it's just...

37:34.900 --> 37:36.690
It's too much of a coincidence, what,

37:36.739 --> 37:40.090
to be an oil lamp she's left on?
Come on, he was burning evidence

37:40.139 --> 37:42.570
and that is so different from...

37:42.619 --> 37:44.730
Well, that is someone who knows her.

37:44.780 --> 37:48.340
It's personal, right? And the
others, they weren't personal.

37:55.579 --> 38:01.130
I need you to explain why, and
it's two things we've uncovered --

38:01.179 --> 38:05.570
yesterday you told us that
you'd never met Ana Vasalescu.

38:05.619 --> 38:07.050
Do you remember?

38:07.099 --> 38:09.449
You also told us that no-one
else had driven your van

38:09.500 --> 38:11.900
in the last six months. Yeah?

38:13.860 --> 38:15.659
So, Sean...

38:17.739 --> 38:19.610
.. can you tell me what your response is

38:19.659 --> 38:22.050
if I tell you that our forensic
people have found strands

38:22.099 --> 38:24.889
of Ana Vasalescu's hair, her DNA,

38:24.940 --> 38:26.900
in your van?

38:33.659 --> 38:35.139
No comment.

38:38.260 --> 38:39.659
Hmm.

38:42.780 --> 38:45.929
And yesterday, you told us that
you don't know Lynn Dewhurst.

38:45.980 --> 38:47.650
Do you remember?

38:50.059 --> 38:51.889
Could you explain to me why, then, Sean,

38:51.940 --> 38:54.050
you've got Lynn Dewhurst's
mobile phone number

38:54.099 --> 38:56.639
in your contacts on your mobile phone?

38:58.099 --> 38:59.769
No... no comment.

39:18.820 --> 39:22.170
When I said "lunch", I had somewhere
a bit more salubrious in mind.

39:22.219 --> 39:23.969
I've only got 15 minutes.

39:24.019 --> 39:25.690
How are you?

39:25.739 --> 39:29.170
- How are YOU? - I'm all right.
I'll cut to the chase, eh?

39:29.219 --> 39:31.929
Can I have some tea, love?
And a fish finger butty.

39:31.980 --> 39:33.409
Are you eating?

39:33.460 --> 39:35.929
Yeah, I'll have the same. Thanks.

39:35.980 --> 39:38.530
It's a bit like speed dating, innit?

39:38.579 --> 39:40.690
Not that I've ever been speed dating.

39:40.739 --> 39:42.690
Or that WE'RE dating, obviously.

39:42.739 --> 39:45.329
- But I've seen it on t'telly.
- Tell me about Sean Balmforth.

39:45.380 --> 39:47.050
Oh...

39:47.099 --> 39:48.570
Really?

39:48.619 --> 39:50.650
All day yesterday? Your lot?

39:50.699 --> 39:53.250
Well, best part of two hours, giving it...

39:53.300 --> 39:54.769
What do you know?

39:54.820 --> 39:56.570
Nothing. I told 'em.

39:56.619 --> 39:58.409
Except...

39:58.460 --> 40:00.010
I wouldn't put it past him.

40:00.059 --> 40:02.690
Which is a pretty damning thing
to say about somebody, innit?

40:02.739 --> 40:04.940
- Really?
- Well, God knows.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.329
Helen never gave up on anybody.

40:08.380 --> 40:10.210
Ever.

40:10.260 --> 40:12.530
We condemn the sin, not the sinner.

40:12.579 --> 40:14.050
But Sean...

40:15.420 --> 40:17.159
.. he's a sad lad.

40:17.659 --> 40:21.329
Course, it's nothing to do
with me, I'm just being nosey.

40:21.380 --> 40:22.769
How's our Annie getting on?

40:22.820 --> 40:24.449
Really well.

40:24.500 --> 40:27.130
- She's a smart kid.
- Good.

40:27.179 --> 40:29.690
- How's things at home?
- Oh, good.

40:29.739 --> 40:31.420
- Good.
- Yeah.

40:34.420 --> 40:36.960
- Yeah.
- She's drinking, isn't she?

40:39.260 --> 40:41.530
Last thing I want to do
is get her into trouble.

40:41.579 --> 40:43.090
You won't, not with me.

40:43.139 --> 40:45.010
That's why I rang you.

40:45.619 --> 40:48.449
I don't know why she's started again.

40:48.500 --> 40:51.170
One minute she was all,
"I'm going to be a regular,

40:51.219 --> 40:54.010
"I'm going to be detective, I'm
going to sail through the ranks."

40:54.059 --> 40:56.369
I thought she'd taken to
it like a duck to water.

40:56.420 --> 40:58.809
And she was thrilled to bits
when she made that connection

40:58.860 --> 41:00.530
with the Vicky Fleming woman.

41:00.579 --> 41:02.050
And then...

41:05.219 --> 41:07.650
She used to drink a lot, at college.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.639
Daft amount, you know,
like they do, students.

41:11.460 --> 41:13.489
She got alcohol poisoning once.

41:13.539 --> 41:15.210
Silly bugger.

41:15.260 --> 41:18.530
But then, when Helen became ill,

41:18.579 --> 41:20.610
she seemed to stop, overnight.

41:20.659 --> 41:22.690
She became very sensible.

41:22.739 --> 41:26.610
All through the illness,
even after what happened,

41:26.659 --> 41:28.800
last year, wi' them weirdos.

41:29.820 --> 41:32.820
So I don't know if
something's happened at work.

41:34.420 --> 41:36.769
- Not that I know of.
- Well...

41:36.820 --> 41:39.650
- has somebody upset her?
- Have you asked her?

41:39.699 --> 41:42.010
Oh, she doesn't talk to me about stuff.

41:42.059 --> 41:45.539
She might have had a conversation
with Helen about it, not me.

41:46.739 --> 41:49.289
Does she drink with other
people, or is it...?

41:49.340 --> 41:52.019
No, no, it's all been on her own at home.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.099
OK.

41:58.340 --> 42:00.849
Happens she needs a good night out.

42:00.900 --> 42:04.769
Yeah? Well, we could all do
with one o' them, couldn't we?

42:04.820 --> 42:06.489
I'll talk to her.

42:07.820 --> 42:09.559
Are you all right?

42:13.300 --> 42:15.639
It was Ryan's birthday yesterday.

42:16.300 --> 42:19.380
Becky died six weeks after
he was born, so, you know...

42:21.300 --> 42:24.460
.. it's just something we have
to get through in our house.

42:28.179 --> 42:30.650
I were thinking....

42:30.699 --> 42:33.239
you know what you told me last night?

42:33.900 --> 42:35.099
Yeah?

42:35.940 --> 42:38.170
I've said I won't say
anything to our Catherine,

42:38.219 --> 42:40.610
and I shan't, I've promised,

42:40.659 --> 42:43.170
but don't you think you
SHOULD tell the police?

42:43.219 --> 42:46.489
I'm just thinking that whoever...

42:46.539 --> 42:48.690
killed her,

42:48.739 --> 42:51.280
she might have been blackmailing HIM.

42:52.099 --> 42:53.530
But...

42:53.579 --> 42:55.449
isn't this bloke a serial killer?

42:55.500 --> 42:56.610
On the news they're saying

42:56.659 --> 42:59.489
she didn't fit the same
profile as the others.

42:59.539 --> 43:01.369
It might be a different
killer to the others,

43:01.420 --> 43:04.530
and they need to know that.

43:04.579 --> 43:06.610
Well, the police obviously
don't think that.

43:06.659 --> 43:08.929
They've... they've linked them.

43:10.179 --> 43:12.690
And they've got this fella
in custody now anyway, so...

43:12.739 --> 43:15.139
Yeah, but what if... What if...

43:16.179 --> 43:17.769
Oh...

43:17.820 --> 43:19.360
I don't know.

43:20.940 --> 43:22.329
Look...

43:22.380 --> 43:24.570
if I went down there and
offered them information,

43:24.619 --> 43:26.889
first of all, they'd think I was a crank.

43:26.940 --> 43:29.139
And they'd be laughing at me.

43:29.619 --> 43:32.409
Then I'd have to go through it all.

43:32.460 --> 43:34.599
Again and again and again...

43:38.420 --> 43:41.619
You don't know what
that does to me, Clare.

43:46.860 --> 43:48.329
Hiya, love.

43:51.539 --> 43:54.090
Sarge, have you got a minute?

43:54.139 --> 43:55.889
Hello, Steph.

43:55.940 --> 43:57.530
I think that...

43:57.579 --> 43:59.409
I think I've decided that I should resign.

43:59.460 --> 44:01.610
I've spoken to the
specials liaison officer.

44:01.659 --> 44:04.090
I don't think you should resign.

44:04.139 --> 44:07.610
- Well, it looks like they're going
to charge this bloke. - Does it?

44:07.659 --> 44:09.329
They've had him in custody for two days.

44:09.380 --> 44:11.530
I've just heard they're
applying to the magistrate

44:11.579 --> 44:12.650
for a three-day lie down.

44:12.699 --> 44:14.809
And I let him slip through
my fingers, so yeah.

44:14.860 --> 44:17.530
Steph, how long have you been in the job?

44:19.260 --> 44:21.329
Specials? About six month.

44:23.019 --> 44:24.929
You made a mistake.

44:24.980 --> 44:28.530
I suspect you listened to
Bryony, who IS a lazy sod,

44:28.579 --> 44:31.659
and whose first and last
instinct is to do the minimum.

44:32.659 --> 44:35.489
She's the one who should be
offering to resign, not you.

44:35.539 --> 44:37.250
She's been in the job five years

44:37.300 --> 44:39.929
and she knows no more
now than she did then.

44:39.980 --> 44:44.010
I suspect you wanted to do more,
but you let yourself be led by her.

44:44.059 --> 44:45.260
Yeah?

44:46.940 --> 44:48.650
Go with your own instincts in future,

44:48.699 --> 44:51.010
stick your neck out now and again.

44:51.059 --> 44:52.329
Yeah, Leonie's a prostitute,

44:52.380 --> 44:54.530
but she's also a vulnerable 19-year-old

44:54.579 --> 44:57.679
who is where she is because
she's had a shit life.

44:58.940 --> 45:00.480
Don't resign.

45:01.539 --> 45:04.139
I'll be really pissed off if you resign.

45:19.179 --> 45:21.730
Last week, in assembly...

45:21.780 --> 45:24.860
Mrs Beresford was on about forgiveness.

45:28.619 --> 45:29.960
Was she?

45:30.980 --> 45:34.900
She said that we had to find it in
our hearts to forgive people things.

45:36.260 --> 45:37.610
Good.

45:37.659 --> 45:40.199
Especially if they say they're sorry.

45:41.380 --> 45:43.010
That's right.

45:43.059 --> 45:45.599
However angry or upset we might feel.

45:46.980 --> 45:50.250
Well, yeah. There you go, eh?

45:50.300 --> 45:55.090
So I was thinking, maybe it was
his way of trying to say sorry

45:55.139 --> 45:59.380
for what he did, sending
me that Scalextric, me dad.

46:01.820 --> 46:05.090
Ryan, you've got to stop
calling him your dad.

46:05.139 --> 46:08.210
You've got to stop thinking
about this man as your dad.

46:08.260 --> 46:10.460
A dad is someone who's there.

46:11.539 --> 46:13.019
Every day.

46:14.019 --> 46:18.289
Someone who cares about you, who
loves you, who helps you, who...

46:18.340 --> 46:20.570
w-who shows you how to...

46:20.619 --> 46:22.650
tie your laces or pump up your tyres,

46:22.699 --> 46:26.610
someone who can take you places,
someone who knows who you are.

46:26.659 --> 46:29.610
It's not someone who lies to you
about living on a narrow boat

46:29.659 --> 46:30.929
and pours petrol over you

46:30.980 --> 46:34.050
and kicks the living daylights
out of your grandmother.

46:34.099 --> 46:37.650
But perhaps he would have liked
to have done them things with me

46:37.699 --> 46:39.849
- if he hadn't been in prison.
- Yeah, but Ryan,

46:39.900 --> 46:43.570
perhaps if he was the kind of man
who cared about other people enough,

46:43.619 --> 46:46.719
he'd never have been in
prison in the first place.

47:30.260 --> 47:31.769
Amanda!

47:31.820 --> 47:33.139
Ama...!

47:39.780 --> 47:41.300
What?!

47:43.699 --> 47:45.889
- Ben, open the door.
- Kids, in the other room, come on.

47:45.940 --> 47:48.090
- Quick, quick, quick.
- He lives here too!

47:48.139 --> 47:49.489
Go in there. Ben...

47:49.539 --> 47:51.849
- Go on, in there.
- Where will he go?

47:51.900 --> 47:55.130
He'll be fine, he'll go to his
mother's, go in there. Both of you!

47:55.179 --> 47:58.610
- I don't want him not to be here,
even if he is a pig. - Amanda!

47:58.659 --> 48:00.659
Go in there, both of you.

48:06.380 --> 48:07.920
Oh, bollocks!

48:09.659 --> 48:11.369
You're upsetting these children!

48:11.420 --> 48:14.050
I'M upsetting 'em?! You're
the one that's upsetting them!

48:14.099 --> 48:15.769
You need to leave us alone.

48:15.820 --> 48:17.889
- You need to go away.
- Fuck you!

48:17.940 --> 48:19.940
- Fuck YOU!
- Fuck you!

48:23.980 --> 48:26.179
Come on, let's get you inside.

48:51.699 --> 48:53.050
Hiya.

48:53.099 --> 48:54.250
Hiya.

48:54.300 --> 48:56.039
Are you all right?

49:01.179 --> 49:04.179
I'm sorry that I get wound
up about stuff, but...

49:05.500 --> 49:07.769
.. it's only cos I love
you and I care about you,

49:07.820 --> 49:09.130
you know that, don't you?

49:09.179 --> 49:10.420
Yup.

49:15.980 --> 49:17.579
Right, come on.

49:35.780 --> 49:37.380
Love you.

49:40.539 --> 49:42.019
I love you.

49:43.340 --> 49:45.489
Night-night.

49:45.539 --> 49:47.409
Night-night.

49:59.780 --> 50:02.369
What's happened to t'front of your car?

50:02.420 --> 50:03.969
I just...

50:04.019 --> 50:05.619
scraped a wall.

50:08.940 --> 50:12.039
I hope you weren't drinking
and driving. Were you?

50:13.500 --> 50:16.039
You will get caught, you know, Daryl.

50:19.900 --> 50:22.369
And who's going to pay
for that getting fixed?

50:22.420 --> 50:25.369
It's reight, it still goes.

50:25.420 --> 50:28.489
It won't pass its MOT,
love, not like that.

50:28.539 --> 50:30.739
And what if you'd hit someone?

50:40.860 --> 50:43.690
- What've you got for me?
- I think you'll be pleased.

50:43.739 --> 50:46.980
I didn't, and I told you I
wouldn't, do anything illegal.

50:49.099 --> 50:51.730
You're not going to tell
me you didn't do owt.

50:51.780 --> 50:53.579
I did do something.

50:55.659 --> 50:57.210
Did you know it was his birthday?

50:57.260 --> 50:59.010
The day before yesterday?

50:59.059 --> 51:02.250
I only found out two days before.

51:02.300 --> 51:04.170
He was... He was ten.

51:05.380 --> 51:06.980
Ten years old.

51:08.739 --> 51:10.289
OK.

51:10.340 --> 51:12.340
So I sent him a present.

51:14.619 --> 51:17.849
I left it on the doorstep
with a card inside.

51:17.900 --> 51:19.300
From you.

51:20.260 --> 51:22.409
It was expensive,
something I knew he'd like.

51:22.460 --> 51:24.130
Racing cars. And he did.

51:24.179 --> 51:26.969
Of course, she wanted to put it in the bin

51:27.019 --> 51:29.570
when she knew it was from you,
and she did put it in the bin,

51:29.619 --> 51:31.570
and, of course, that
made him angry and upset.

51:31.619 --> 51:33.960
- How do you know?
- He told me.

51:35.699 --> 51:38.800
And it's made him start to
ask even more questions.

51:40.139 --> 51:42.690
I suggested to him that you sent it

51:42.739 --> 51:44.969
because you're sorry for what you did.

51:45.019 --> 51:47.449
I think that's a very powerful message.

51:47.500 --> 51:53.449
If we can subtly undermine all the
messages she reinforces every day,

51:53.500 --> 51:57.210
it may be a slow process, but
if we persist, and we will,

51:57.260 --> 52:00.460
- surely that's better than...
- I don't understand.

52:02.340 --> 52:04.099
OK.

52:05.860 --> 52:08.969
Am I...? Am I being thick,

52:09.019 --> 52:12.019
or are you just not getting the
fact that there's been a development?

52:13.699 --> 52:17.019
This bitch, this nasty ugly whore.

52:20.300 --> 52:22.139
Sorry, but she...

52:23.579 --> 52:25.519
She's killed my mother.

52:26.900 --> 52:30.619
And you think buying him expensive
toys is some sort of solution?

52:31.780 --> 52:33.769
I-I don't know that I can do anything

52:33.820 --> 52:35.690
- about what she did
to your mother. - But...

52:35.739 --> 52:39.539
- What I can do with Ryan...
- That is what I asked you to do.

52:42.340 --> 52:44.250
It may not have been her.

52:44.300 --> 52:46.889
- They've arrested someone.
- I know they've arrested someone.

52:46.940 --> 52:49.480
I saw it on t'news, Frances, so what?

52:50.860 --> 52:52.380
Frances...

52:55.539 --> 52:58.329
.. you're sweet, but you're naive.

52:58.380 --> 53:02.329
She has killed my mother to piss on me,

53:02.380 --> 53:04.050
just cos she can.

53:04.780 --> 53:07.250
Like me living in this
shit-hole isn't enough for her.

53:07.300 --> 53:09.809
And she has disguised it by
killing them others first,

53:09.860 --> 53:12.449
and now her little police buddies
are helping her cover it up

53:12.500 --> 53:14.969
by arresting some no-mates
who they can pin anything on.

53:15.019 --> 53:17.090
Do you really believe they could do that?

53:17.139 --> 53:19.809
Oh, I don't know what else to say to you.

53:21.500 --> 53:24.500
You've led a sheltered
life, it's not your fault.

53:25.699 --> 53:28.409
It's why you're so good and kind.

53:28.460 --> 53:31.260
It's why you always see
the best in people.

53:32.219 --> 53:33.780
Frances...

53:39.019 --> 53:41.769
But some people, and she is one of 'em,

53:41.820 --> 53:45.130
they're craftier than you'd
ever give 'em credit for,

53:45.179 --> 53:47.530
and they get themselves
into positions of authority

53:47.579 --> 53:49.920
so they can get away with stuff.

53:53.099 --> 53:55.500
I don't know what else to say. I...

53:56.699 --> 53:58.570
I thought you got it.

54:03.739 --> 54:06.130
The priority for me is
working towards Ryan

54:06.179 --> 54:09.090
not accepting the demonised version
of you that she reinforces...

54:09.139 --> 54:10.449
The best way to achieve that...

54:10.500 --> 54:12.610
I told him I didn't believe
you did half of what...

54:12.659 --> 54:15.130
As far as I'm concerned, the
best way to achieve that...

54:15.179 --> 54:18.489
- .. he listened, he thought about it,
and it sank in. - .. is to remove her.

54:18.539 --> 54:20.210
From the picture.

54:21.260 --> 54:22.409
Reinforce that.

54:22.460 --> 54:25.969
- But what you're suggesting
is illegal... - Fuck illegal!

54:26.019 --> 54:29.579
When has doing anything legally
got anybody like me anywhere?

54:32.460 --> 54:36.179
Frances, you're going to have
to do what I've asked you to do.

54:39.780 --> 54:41.849
Or what I'm thinking is...

54:44.460 --> 54:45.940
.. this...

54:49.179 --> 54:50.849
.. you and me...

54:53.380 --> 54:56.250
.. it's not going to work, I'm sorry.

54:56.300 --> 54:59.369
I thought you understood me. I really did.

54:59.420 --> 55:02.570
I do! I do understand you,
don't say that, please.

55:02.619 --> 55:04.809
Please, I understand
you better than anyone.

55:04.860 --> 55:08.099
- Do you understand what I'm saying,
then? - I... - Nothing is illegal.

55:12.179 --> 55:15.420
It's just a word people use
to control other people with.

55:17.179 --> 55:21.090
She has stolen my son
and murdered my mother.

55:21.139 --> 55:24.139
That is illegal and nobody
has raised an eyebrow.

55:25.460 --> 55:27.250
And believe me,

55:27.300 --> 55:29.889
it is not that lad they've
arrested that's killed these women.

55:29.940 --> 55:32.539
Look at him, picture of him, on t'telly.

55:33.380 --> 55:35.380
He hasn't got it in him.

55:37.460 --> 55:39.059
Frances...

55:40.900 --> 55:43.369
.. if you're not on my side, who is?

55:49.260 --> 55:51.460
What would you like me to do?

55:53.099 --> 55:56.130
I'd like you to use your imagination.

55:56.179 --> 55:58.650
- I have been doing.
- Yeah, you have.

55:58.699 --> 56:00.610
Brilliantly.

56:00.659 --> 56:03.860
I was so impressed, the way
you got into that school.

56:05.900 --> 56:07.570
But I need more.

56:08.900 --> 56:11.099
I need you to take it further.

56:12.219 --> 56:14.730
I wasn't anticipating it
any more than you were.

56:14.780 --> 56:18.730
I didn't know she'd go out of
her way to target my mother,

56:18.780 --> 56:20.250
but she did.

56:21.460 --> 56:24.570
And now they're going to go out
of their way to let her walk,

56:24.619 --> 56:26.619
and I can't do anything.

56:27.619 --> 56:29.090
But you can.

56:31.300 --> 56:34.730
If our two hearts do beat as one,

56:34.780 --> 56:37.179
and I like to think that they do...

56:38.659 --> 56:40.860
.. then you know what I want.

56:44.380 --> 56:46.820
You know what I want, Frances.
