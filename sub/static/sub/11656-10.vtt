AKU: Long ago, in a distant land,

00:04.714 --> 00:09.344
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.427 --> 00:13.014
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.097 --> 00:18.686
But a foolish Samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword,

00:18.770 --> 00:21.481
stepped forth to oppose me.

was struck,

00:26.736 --> 00:29.447
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.531 --> 00:31.324
and flung him into the future,

00:31.407 --> 00:33.743
where my evil is law.

00:34.244 --> 00:38.373
Now the fool seeks to return
to the past

00:38.456 --> 00:43.086
and undo the future that is Aku.
