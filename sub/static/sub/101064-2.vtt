11:32.190 --> 11:34.440
You know, how old were you
when you first got into it?

11:34.524 --> 11:38.524
I got interested in true crime,
um, because when I was 14,

11:38.607 --> 11:40.982
uh, living outside of Chicago,

11:41.065 --> 11:43.065
a neighbor of mine was murdered.

11:43.148 --> 11:46.691
Um, and it-- it was,
it's still unsolved.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.148
Her name was Kathy Lombardo.

11:48.232 --> 11:50.023
♪ (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

11:50.107 --> 11:53.607
I grew up in Oak Park, Illinois,
which is outside Chicago.

11:53.691 --> 11:56.273
It was just a laid-back
residential area

11:56.357 --> 11:58.816
and it really kind of
shocked our town.

11:58.899 --> 12:01.148
And it was-- it was
headline news, for sure.

12:01.232 --> 12:03.691
MALE REPORTER 1:
Kathy Lombardo grew up
in this neighborhood.

12:03.774 --> 12:05.023
She felt safe here.

12:05.107 --> 12:07.482
So she could be found just
about every night of the week

12:07.565 --> 12:09.857
walking briskly through
these streets and alleys,

12:09.941 --> 12:13.732
always alone, always wearing
her stereo headphones

12:13.816 --> 12:16.065
with the music
turned up full blast.

12:16.148 --> 12:19.315
Last night, somebody grabbed
the 24-year-old Oak Park woman

12:19.399 --> 12:21.232
in an alley,
probably from behind,

12:21.315 --> 12:23.691
stabbed her in the heart,
and slashed her throat.

12:23.774 --> 12:26.816
Police say she was probably
sexually attacked as well.

12:26.899 --> 12:29.357
She was found just
after 10:00 by two youths,

12:29.440 --> 12:31.023
who called a neighbor
to the scene.

12:31.107 --> 12:33.565
I got there
and went to reach down

12:33.649 --> 12:39.732
to check her carotid pulse,
and her throat was slit open.

12:39.816 --> 12:43.982
Uh, she was turning pale fast
and, uh...

12:45.315 --> 12:46.732
couple pumps, you know,

12:46.816 --> 12:48.649
a couple more pumps
from her throat,

12:48.732 --> 12:50.649
and she was dead.

12:51.816 --> 12:53.273
MICHELLE: I don't think,
up until that point,

12:53.357 --> 12:55.982
I had been interested
in murder at all.

12:56.065 --> 12:57.649
I was just very gripped
by this story

12:57.732 --> 13:00.065
and very shocked by it
and very, um, obsessed

13:00.148 --> 13:02.982
with kind of the blankness
of this person's face.

13:03.065 --> 13:05.190
That we didn't know
who may be, like,

13:05.273 --> 13:07.357
slinking by us
covered in blood.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.899
I mean, it just seemed
so unbelievable to me

13:09.982 --> 13:13.774
that someone among us
was a cold-blooded killer

13:13.857 --> 13:15.774
who had cut this woman's throat.

13:15.857 --> 13:18.816
MALE REPORTER 1:
Today, police scoured the alley
where the murder took place

13:18.899 --> 13:20.607
and found the blade
of the kitchen knife

13:20.691 --> 13:22.607
they think was used
to kill the young woman.

13:22.691 --> 13:24.440
They're still searching
for the handle,

13:24.524 --> 13:25.565
which was broken off.

13:25.649 --> 13:27.232
What happened to her is wrong.

13:27.315 --> 13:29.482
It could happen to you
or me or anyone.

13:31.857 --> 13:34.273
MICHELLE: I remember
walking to the place

13:34.357 --> 13:36.399
where I knew
she had been killed and...

13:36.482 --> 13:39.774
um, finding kinda these
shattered pieces of Walkman

13:39.857 --> 13:42.941
that were still there
and kinda picking them up.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.023
I didn't go as far as
to talk to,

13:45.107 --> 13:46.482
you know, the police
or anything like that,

13:46.565 --> 13:48.148
but I was definitely
very curious

13:48.232 --> 13:51.065
about the different elements
of the crime

13:51.148 --> 13:54.273
and how it had happened
and who this guy could be.

13:54.941 --> 13:56.565
Was he someone we knew?

13:58.232 --> 14:00.273
Everyone moved on,
and I couldn't.

14:02.899 --> 14:05.357
-From, like, '75 to '84...
-LARRY: Yeah.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.816
MICHELLE: ...there were
so many serial offenders

operating at the same time.
It blows my mind.

14:09.524 --> 14:11.482
-LARRY: Yeah, yeah.
-MICHELLE:
I don't know why that was,

14:11.565 --> 14:14.273
-but there was a ton of that.
-LARRY: I don't either.

14:14.357 --> 14:18.357
The East Area Rapist
was not the most active.

14:18.440 --> 14:22.524
He was the most violent,
from what we knew.

14:22.607 --> 14:26.232
He would break into the homes
while they were sleeping.

14:29.273 --> 14:32.941
The sex was not... his thing.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.899
The terror that he put in 'em
was the thing.

14:40.982 --> 14:42.607
CAROL DALY: Now,
one of the big questions

14:42.691 --> 14:44.649
that was asked here last night,

14:44.732 --> 14:47.023
"If we have a gun,
could we shoot him?"

14:47.107 --> 14:48.982
Knowing what I know
about this man,

14:49.065 --> 14:51.857
if I had a gun,
I definitely would shoot him.

14:51.941 --> 14:53.357
And I would not shoot to injure.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.732
I would shoot
to take care of him.

14:55.816 --> 14:57.857
There are two things known
about the rapist

14:57.941 --> 15:00.232
currently terrorizing
Sacramento.

15:00.315 --> 15:02.649
One is he has never been caught
in a home

15:02.732 --> 15:04.524
where there was a man present.

15:04.607 --> 15:07.899
The other is
he's never been in a home

15:07.982 --> 15:10.190
where there has been a big dog.

15:11.816 --> 15:15.232
MELANIE: '77 became a time
where the East Area Rapist

15:15.315 --> 15:17.982
-began attacking couples.
-MICHELLE: And why do you think

15:18.065 --> 15:20.857
he did-- he started
to do couples?

15:20.941 --> 15:24.023
LARRY: I really do think it was
because of the news media.

15:24.107 --> 15:25.065
MICHELLE: Yeah.

15:25.148 --> 15:28.565
The first 15 rapes
in the Sacramento area

15:28.649 --> 15:30.565
were lone women.

15:30.649 --> 15:33.565
The newspaper printed
that he'd never hit a place

15:33.649 --> 15:35.315
with a man in the house.

15:35.941 --> 15:37.899
And after that...

15:37.982 --> 15:39.691
there was a man in the house.

15:39.774 --> 15:41.732
-MICHELLE:
So he was aware of that?
-LARRY: Yeah.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.982
MICHELLE:
And-- and that would go
to the game playing part of it?

15:44.065 --> 15:45.482
-LARRY: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-MICHELLE: Mm-hmm.

15:45.565 --> 15:48.899
Absolutely, he was watching
the media with everything.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.941
And as soon as the newspaper
would say, "This didn't happen,"

15:52.023 --> 15:53.148
it would happen.

15:53.232 --> 15:55.691
Everything became
a challenge to him.

I didn't have a lot of exposure

15:59.232 --> 16:01.691

16:02.482 --> 16:04.107
I didn't see the newspaper.

16:04.190 --> 16:07.232
I don't remember hearing it
on the news.

16:07.315 --> 16:09.440
In the weeks
leading up to the attack,

16:09.524 --> 16:10.691
we had...

16:10.774 --> 16:12.732
hang-up calls.

16:12.816 --> 16:15.273
Uh, I believe three, four a day.

16:15.357 --> 16:16.941
We would have them.

Um...

16:20.440 --> 16:21.607

16:21.691 --> 16:25.565
it didn't register to me.
I was 15.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.482
Maybe it was a boy
that liked me.

16:30.232 --> 16:33.107
I really didn't have any...

16:33.774 --> 16:35.107
I'll say it this way.

16:35.190 --> 16:37.273

any reason to be fearful

keeping up with the demand.

I wasn't scared at the time.

a lot of it going on.

The one indication we got was...

17:04.148 --> 17:05.982
my husband and I came home,

17:06.065 --> 17:07.440
and the kids
in the neighborhood

17:07.524 --> 17:09.065
come running up to us
and they said,

17:09.148 --> 17:11.941
"We're playing this game
and I was on somebody's back

17:12.023 --> 17:15.065

run out of your yard."

17:15.148 --> 17:16.482
We were like, "What?"

17:17.774 --> 17:20.691
So we went, we got deadbolts,
where you put the key in

17:20.774 --> 17:23.482
for the front door
and the garage door.

17:23.565 --> 17:25.357
We put this nail at the top

17:25.440 --> 17:28.816
so you could lock the slider
and it can't go.

17:28.899 --> 17:31.232
And he had cased the place,

17:31.315 --> 17:34.607
he knew to lift the glass up
out of the back window.

They're looking at me
and the husband comes down

21:58.190 --> 22:00.357
and he sees
that I'm, you know, naked,

22:00.440 --> 22:03.607
and he grabs his wife's jacket,
puts it on me,

22:03.691 --> 22:05.399
and I said,
"I've just been raped.

22:05.482 --> 22:07.023
And my husband's tied up."

22:09.065 --> 22:10.148
He got a gun,

22:10.232 --> 22:12.565
he told his wife
to call the police,

22:12.649 --> 22:13.941
"Stay here."

22:15.190 --> 22:17.732
And then I waited
for the police to come.

22:17.816 --> 22:21.649
And they came,
they took me back to the house.

22:21.732 --> 22:24.065
Carol Daly
was a female detective

22:24.148 --> 22:27.440
who I was so grateful
that she was there at that time.

22:27.524 --> 22:29.148
Everybody else was men,

22:29.232 --> 22:30.982
and she was the only woman
in the group.

22:31.065 --> 22:33.107
And that was--
that was a nice feeling.

22:33.190 --> 22:34.816
We have information that he...

22:34.899 --> 22:36.774
LINDA:
She got me to the hospital.

22:36.857 --> 22:38.649
And she said,
"You're okay, honey."

22:38.732 --> 22:40.273
She said,
"I think you're in shock."

22:40.357 --> 22:41.982
So she's kind of, like,
being a mother to me.

22:42.065 --> 22:44.107
She says,
"You take as much time,"

22:44.190 --> 22:47.357
and we talked about it.
Went back home.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.524
Basically, I went in
and I said to my husband,

22:49.607 --> 22:50.899
"Do you wanna--
do you wanna hear--

22:50.982 --> 22:53.357
know what happened?"
He goes, "I know what happened."

22:53.440 --> 22:55.232
And he said, "I don't want
to talk about it."

22:55.315 --> 22:57.273
He said,
"I got rid of your pajamas

22:57.357 --> 22:59.524
and you don't have
to see those anymore."

22:59.607 --> 23:00.941
And I said, "Okay."

23:02.273 --> 23:05.399
I don't think a lot of men knew
how to deal with it,

23:05.482 --> 23:07.273
to be honest.

23:07.357 --> 23:09.524
I don't think-- I don't--

23:09.607 --> 23:12.649
I know that he cared
and he felt terrible,

23:12.732 --> 23:15.857
but I don't think he wanted
to relive it either.

23:15.941 --> 23:17.899
He's basically,
"We don't talk about it.

23:17.982 --> 23:19.440
It's gone away."

23:21.315 --> 23:24.232
MICHELLE: I think
this kind of crime was just...

23:24.315 --> 23:26.107
very ripe for the '70s

23:26.190 --> 23:28.899
because there's, um...

23:28.982 --> 23:30.899
How many people
did not call the police

23:30.982 --> 23:32.816
who saw something suspicious
is crazy.

23:32.899 --> 23:34.899
And that would not
happen today.

23:34.982 --> 23:36.732
Had you had anybody--

23:36.816 --> 23:38.565
any neighbors mention
anybody weird

23:38.649 --> 23:40.232
around the neighborhood
or anything like that?

23:40.315 --> 23:42.273
-Do you remember?
-FIONA WILLIAMS: No.

23:42.357 --> 23:44.399
We were very aware of it.

23:44.482 --> 23:47.482
But it was in East Sacramento.

23:47.565 --> 23:51.774
So we were sympathetic to--
but not alarmed

23:51.857 --> 23:54.440
because we're not
his side of town.

23:54.524 --> 23:57.691
You know he picked us partly
for the location of the house.

23:57.774 --> 23:59.982
-MICHELLE: Mm-hmm.
-FIONA: Right by the freeway,

24:00.065 --> 24:02.607
-empty lot behind us.
-MICHELLE: Empty field, right.

24:02.691 --> 24:03.816
FIONA: All of that.

24:03.899 --> 24:08.065
And of course, they asked us
about strange cars...

24:08.148 --> 24:10.565
MICHELLE: I mean, so when--
when-- Did you have--

24:10.649 --> 24:13.482
did you feel in your heart
when this is happening

24:13.565 --> 24:14.816
this was a stranger?

24:14.899 --> 24:17.190
That this was not someone
that you knew?

24:17.273 --> 24:19.065
-FIONA: Oh, yeah.
-MICHELLE: You did?

24:19.148 --> 24:20.941
You thought,
"This is the East Area Rapist."

24:21.023 --> 24:22.732
-FIONA: Which makes me-- Yeah.
-MICHELLE: Yeah.

24:24.065 --> 24:26.273
I knew it was the guy then.

24:26.357 --> 24:30.190
I mean, by that time,
this was attack 22.

24:33.649 --> 24:36.607
My husband and I,
we were in our bedroom.

24:36.691 --> 24:39.607
We were starting
to fool around,

24:39.691 --> 24:42.816
-we hear a scratching.
-MICHELLE: Right.

24:44.565 --> 24:47.816
The EAR was a man of few words,

24:47.899 --> 24:51.982
and mostly the same,
as I would come to read,

24:52.065 --> 24:53.273
over time.

24:53.357 --> 24:55.565
He did indeed have a script.

24:56.857 --> 25:01.565
What he said to us
and mostly routinely was,

25:01.649 --> 25:04.941
"I just want money and food,
and then I'll be gone."

25:10.440 --> 25:15.524
My son was three years old.

25:15.607 --> 25:21.273
He woke up as I was being
blindfold-led down the hall.

25:22.941 --> 25:26.273
EAR told him
to get back in his room.

25:29.941 --> 25:33.607
When he took me into
the living room for the assault,

25:33.691 --> 25:35.899
I remember saying to him,

25:35.982 --> 25:38.023
"Why are you doing this?"

25:38.107 --> 25:39.982
And he said, "Shut up."

25:40.065 --> 25:43.524
And I said, "I'm sorry."
(LAUGHS)

25:43.607 --> 25:45.440
This is...

25:45.524 --> 25:48.524
This is how women were
in the '70s and the olden times.

25:48.607 --> 25:51.524
I said, "I'm sorry."
And he said, "Shut up," again.

25:51.607 --> 25:54.607
And that was the longest
conversation I had with him,

25:54.691 --> 25:59.649
except at the end when he
gave me the instructions about

25:59.732 --> 26:03.482
you know, tell the pigs
I have television.

26:03.565 --> 26:05.607
MICHELLE: Wow. God.

26:07.982 --> 26:10.732
He didn't want it to be on TV

26:10.816 --> 26:13.816
and if it was on TV,
he'd kill two people,

26:13.899 --> 26:16.399
but then I believe
he told my husband

26:16.482 --> 26:18.023
it had to be on TV.

26:18.107 --> 26:24.065
He was constantly playing
these silly games with people.

26:24.148 --> 26:29.691
He had told the victims
of the attack just before us

26:29.774 --> 26:32.399
that he was going to kill
the next two people,

26:32.482 --> 26:34.649
which would have been us.

26:37.816 --> 26:40.899
Sometime after the attack,
my husband managed

26:40.982 --> 26:43.816
to get our phone
re-connected in the bedroom,

26:43.899 --> 26:46.524
that was on the nightstand,
and he called--

26:46.607 --> 26:48.649
in those days,
you still called the operator.

26:59.399 --> 27:02.440
when the uniformed officer
took off...

27:02.524 --> 27:06.107
one of the first things I saw
was that on my formal couch,

27:06.190 --> 27:10.691
the EAR had laid out
three or four of my dresses.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.107
And I do mean laid out.

27:13.190 --> 27:15.816
Not vandalized or thrown about.

27:15.899 --> 27:17.607
They were just laying there.

27:17.691 --> 27:21.232
And I remember very vividly
because I was so surprised,

27:21.315 --> 27:23.857
I was not expecting
to see that.

27:25.524 --> 27:26.941
I said to the officer,

27:27.023 --> 27:30.232
"The East Area Rapist
is now the South Area Rapist."

27:33.941 --> 27:35.982
CAROL THORPE:
The worst thing is not knowing.

27:36.065 --> 27:38.732
Not knowing when the rapist
will strike again.

27:38.816 --> 27:41.190
Not knowing
if you'll be his next victim.

27:41.273 --> 27:44.107
All you can do is take
every possible precaution

27:44.190 --> 27:46.190
and then hope
that he gets caught

27:46.273 --> 27:47.649
before he gets to you.

hunting knife under the pillow.

We don't go to sleep
very well at night.

27:53.273 --> 27:54.774
We go around
and lock everything up

27:54.857 --> 27:56.315
as tightly as we can.

27:56.399 --> 27:58.691
As of tonight,
the East Area Rapist

27:58.774 --> 28:01.315
has struck on the average
once every two weeks,

28:01.399 --> 28:03.816
sometimes every two days,
sometimes a week apart,

28:03.899 --> 28:05.816
sometimes three
or four weeks apart.

reportedly are doing the same.

They call themselves
the EARS Patrol.

Rapist Surveillance.

that after all this time,

28:24.691 --> 28:27.357
the police should've been able
to catch the East Area Rapist.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.482
I think that the reason

28:28.565 --> 28:30.190
there hasn't been
something done about it

28:30.273 --> 28:32.399
is because
it's a crime against women.

off duty on their own time

where I didn't go to sleep

29:12.982 --> 29:14.232

We had tambourines
on the windows and doors

MICHELLE: When I was a kid,

45:16.107 --> 45:19.941
my family bought a summer place
on the shore of Lake Michigan.

45:22.273 --> 45:25.315
The first couple of summers,
I didn't really know

45:25.399 --> 45:28.190
any of the other kids
in the area.

45:28.273 --> 45:31.107
So I spent a lot of time
on the couch,

45:31.190 --> 45:33.357
on the screened-in front porch,

45:33.440 --> 45:35.941
reading Agatha Christie novels.

45:37.816 --> 45:41.357
My interest in writing
began on that porch.

45:44.482 --> 45:46.691
As a writer,
you could lead a reader

45:46.774 --> 45:48.857
through the act of discovery.

45:53.565 --> 45:56.565
I was amazed
that someone had constructed

45:56.649 --> 45:58.982
these intricate mysteries,

45:59.065 --> 46:01.565
that an actual human being,

46:01.649 --> 46:04.857
a woman,
had plotted and twisted

46:04.941 --> 46:07.649
and carefully
maintained curiosity

46:07.732 --> 46:10.857
so that you never knew
who had done it

46:10.941 --> 46:12.941
until the very end.

46:19.565 --> 46:21.607
Yeah, it's--
it's just, there's so many...

46:21.691 --> 46:23.899
When you think of all the lives
this guy ruined,

46:23.982 --> 46:26.732
and not just the victims,
it just goes on and on and on.

46:26.816 --> 46:29.607
It's-- it's-- it's--
Exponentially, you know.

46:29.691 --> 46:31.440
-FIONA: Right. Right.
-MICHELLE: Yeah.

46:31.524 --> 46:35.065
I've worked
some really bad cases,

46:35.524 --> 46:36.732
and...

46:37.440 --> 46:39.982
this series...

46:40.065 --> 46:44.232
affected me
emotionally and mentally

46:44.315 --> 46:46.399
because there was
no resolution.

46:47.065 --> 46:48.107
Everywhere I went,

46:48.190 --> 46:50.607
it's, "How come you guys
haven't caught that guy?"

46:50.691 --> 46:52.774
There was a lot of--
I wouldn't call it hysteria,

46:52.857 --> 46:55.107
but gun sales went out the roof.

46:55.190 --> 46:57.941
Burglary rates went from 1,400
in a month down to 200.

46:58.023 --> 46:59.899
MALE REPORTER 2:
Sacramento women who have never

46:59.982 --> 47:01.565
-fired a gun before...
-(GUNSHOTS)

47:01.649 --> 47:04.315
...are now learning how to shoot
in larger and larger numbers.

47:04.399 --> 47:05.941
MALE REPORTER 3:
Gun sales are way up,

47:06.023 --> 47:07.691
with some of the buyers
not that familiar

47:07.774 --> 47:10.399
with how to use firearms,
and that can be dangerous.

47:10.482 --> 47:12.982
We had one citizen
that actually shot a person

47:13.065 --> 47:14.023
and killed him.

47:14.107 --> 47:16.774
And, um,
when it came time, uh,

47:16.857 --> 47:18.899
for him to go
to superior court,

47:18.982 --> 47:21.732
the judge said,
"Anybody in the community

47:21.816 --> 47:23.816
at that time
would have done the same thing."

47:23.899 --> 47:25.440
And they dropped the charges.

47:26.565 --> 47:28.774
Back in those days...
(CLEARS THROAT)

47:28.857 --> 47:30.524
...it was very, very...

47:31.565 --> 47:32.982
very difficult

47:33.065 --> 47:34.774
to get departments
to work together.

47:34.857 --> 47:37.315
When the East Area Rapist
left our jurisdiction

47:37.399 --> 47:38.857
and went into the city,

47:38.941 --> 47:40.691
then he went to Stockton
and Modesto

47:40.774 --> 47:43.023
and started expanding,

47:43.107 --> 47:45.691
there was sort of a lack
of communication

47:45.774 --> 47:46.899
between the agencies

47:46.982 --> 47:50.148
because "You guys
couldn't catch him, we will."

47:50.232 --> 47:52.023
And that was the attitude.

47:52.107 --> 47:56.232
In two cases in my area,
I was kicked out of the town,

47:56.315 --> 47:59.357
told they didn't need my help,
didn't want my help.

47:59.440 --> 48:01.482
Two weeks later,
they get hit again.

48:01.565 --> 48:05.232
Just because agencies
didn't work together.

48:08.357 --> 48:11.524
I remember there was a day

48:11.607 --> 48:14.357
that I was on the phone

48:14.440 --> 48:17.607
telling my friend
what had happened.

48:18.357 --> 48:20.107
And my dad...

48:21.440 --> 48:25.148
I guess had picked up
the other line and heard me.

48:25.232 --> 48:30.482
And I got in a lot of trouble
for telling anybody.

48:31.941 --> 48:33.023
And, um...

48:35.565 --> 48:37.982
and I-- I think at that moment,

48:39.315 --> 48:42.899
that would probably be
the beginning feeling of shame.

48:42.982 --> 48:46.691
I felt shame, I felt like,
"Did I wear something?

48:46.774 --> 48:48.482
How did he pick me out?"

48:50.482 --> 48:52.107
MELANIE:
There was this thought

48:52.190 --> 48:55.440
that you were raped
based on your beauty

48:55.524 --> 48:59.565
or your clothing
or your action

48:59.649 --> 49:02.357
and not that something is wrong
with the man

49:02.440 --> 49:05.732
that can't control
these urges.

49:05.816 --> 49:07.565
This was something to do
with him

49:07.649 --> 49:09.273
that had nothing to do

49:09.357 --> 49:10.982
with the woman
who was his victim.

49:11.065 --> 49:13.107
And it was a time where...

49:13.190 --> 49:16.941
somehow, it always came back
to being the woman's fault.

49:17.023 --> 49:18.649
FEMALE NARRATOR 2:
The woman who allows herself

49:18.732 --> 49:21.357
to be seen undressing
or partially clothed

49:21.440 --> 49:23.941
is the woman
who invites trouble.

49:24.023 --> 49:25.982
Here again,
we see lack of awareness,

49:26.065 --> 49:28.273
plus invitational behavior.

49:28.357 --> 49:30.565
MELANIE: You even had cops
saying, you know,

49:30.649 --> 49:33.482
"Well, at least he got
the pretty one of the sisters."

49:36.399 --> 49:40.107
That culture would never know
how to ask the right questions

49:40.190 --> 49:43.273
or say the right things
to a female victim.

49:43.357 --> 49:47.023
The law and procedure
allowed at that time,

49:47.107 --> 49:48.357
the late '70s,

49:48.440 --> 49:52.482
that a rape victim
could be routinely asked

49:52.565 --> 49:56.023
to take a polygraph exam

49:56.107 --> 49:58.065
or to see a psychiatrist.

49:58.148 --> 50:02.482
When people find out
about this violent attack,

50:02.565 --> 50:04.190
it's like, "Well,

50:04.273 --> 50:07.482
how did you get yourself
into that position?"

50:07.565 --> 50:10.732
Or, um,
"Why didn't you somehow

50:10.816 --> 50:13.482
get yourself
out of that position?"

50:13.565 --> 50:16.107
You know, even some
of my best friends would...

50:16.190 --> 50:18.148
like,
"You couldn't do anything?"

50:18.232 --> 50:19.732
You know what I mean?

50:19.816 --> 50:21.565
(QUIETLY)
Just couldn't do anything.

50:24.107 --> 50:26.649
There wasn't anything
to be done.

50:26.732 --> 50:30.190
I couldn't have done anything
if I'd had a gun on the, uh...

50:30.273 --> 50:32.816
on the bed table, you know?
You're just...

50:32.899 --> 50:35.232
You don't mess around
when somebody,

50:36.273 --> 50:39.524
you know, has full control
of the situation.

50:39.607 --> 50:42.565
And there was no mistaking
that he was serious.

Carol and I both have said

51:00.482 --> 51:01.607
he's going to kill somebody.

51:01.691 --> 51:03.899
The guy's getting more
and more brutal as he goes.

51:03.982 --> 51:05.857
More and more violent.

I just had this
very, very strong feeling.

LARRY: I talked to, uh,
the psychiatrist

51:12.107 --> 51:13.440
at the Vacaville Medical Center

51:13.524 --> 51:15.899
that worked
with the rapists there.

51:15.982 --> 51:18.565
And I gave her some reports,
and she said,

51:18.649 --> 51:20.732
"Okay, come back next week.

51:20.816 --> 51:23.399
I'm gonna talk to my rapists
in here."

51:23.482 --> 51:25.732
The best thing to do
if you're in a rape situation

51:25.816 --> 51:28.732
is submit, submit,
submit until it hurts.

51:28.816 --> 51:31.816
Because it's gonna hurt
a lot less in the long run.

51:31.899 --> 51:33.399
If I'm willing to kill you,

51:33.482 --> 51:35.440
the first move you make,
you're gonna be dead.

51:35.524 --> 51:37.232
MAN:

51:37.315 --> 51:39.315
she fought back

51:40.524 --> 51:43.357
I went back the next week
and, uh, she said,

51:43.440 --> 51:45.023
"You had better catch him.

51:45.107 --> 51:48.315
He wants to kill,
and he is going to kill."

51:48.399 --> 51:50.482
And I said,
"Why hasn't he killed?"

51:50.565 --> 51:53.482
And she said, "He hasn't
found the justification."

51:53.565 --> 51:55.357
And I said,
"What's the justification?"

51:55.440 --> 51:58.315
And she said, "I don't know,
but it'll get there."

51:58.399 --> 52:00.148
Of course, we didn't know
at the time

52:00.232 --> 52:01.691
that he'd already killed.

52:05.899 --> 52:08.941
The house right here,

52:09.023 --> 52:12.774
the Maggiores were killed
right outside the fence.

52:12.857 --> 52:15.857
This is where she was shot and
killed and came right out of.

52:15.941 --> 52:18.065
MICHELLE:
Did you feel at the time that
that was related?

52:18.148 --> 52:20.774
MELANIE: During the time
of the East Area Rapist attack,

52:20.857 --> 52:24.023
I had never heard
about these homicides.

52:28.565 --> 52:32.565
The same owners still reside
in these residences

52:32.649 --> 52:34.607
where this happened.

52:34.691 --> 52:37.649
And then, one of the witnesses
lived right here.

52:37.732 --> 52:39.148
WOMAN 2:
I heard five shots,

52:39.232 --> 52:41.732
and I jumped
and looked out the window.

52:41.816 --> 52:45.982
And I saw a man
run down the sidewalk.

52:46.065 --> 52:48.440
And I saw the boy
across the street.

52:48.524 --> 52:51.565
He came running, running down--
right down the sidewalk.

52:51.649 --> 52:55.524
And he came right up
on the lawn next to the tree.

52:55.607 --> 52:58.565
And then right--
right as he came to the tree,

52:58.649 --> 53:01.399
he looked up and he saw me
standing right here.

53:01.482 --> 53:04.399
And he was pretty surprised,

53:04.482 --> 53:06.107
turned around
as quick as he could.

53:06.190 --> 53:09.482
He just turned around and just
headed straight down there

53:09.565 --> 53:12.565
towards the fire hydrant
around the corner.

53:12.649 --> 53:15.524
MELANIE: The Maggiores
were out walking their dog.

53:15.607 --> 53:18.190
They were seen running

53:18.273 --> 53:20.982
and went through this backyard

53:21.065 --> 53:22.899
where they were attacked.

53:22.982 --> 53:26.816
The fact that they were
chased down and shot,

53:26.899 --> 53:29.273
like, Katie was shot
right in the head,

53:29.357 --> 53:31.816
made me think
that they had seen his face

53:31.899 --> 53:33.857
and they could identify him.

53:33.941 --> 53:38.107
I'm an art student
and I drew out a picture of him

53:38.190 --> 53:40.774
standing next to the tree,
because I saw him, and I saw--

53:40.857 --> 53:43.399
I drew a picture of him
running down.

53:44.649 --> 53:47.440
MELANIE: It's believed
that the composite

53:47.524 --> 53:49.857
that was released
at the time

53:49.941 --> 53:54.857
was very close to, um,
what the attacker looked like.

53:54.941 --> 53:57.899
CAROL DALY: I didn't work
the Maggiore homicides

53:57.982 --> 54:00.399
because it was completely
different MO.

54:00.482 --> 54:02.899
Okay, this isn't in a home
in a rape case,

54:02.982 --> 54:06.190
but this is a prowler
in a ski mask.

54:06.273 --> 54:09.524
MELANIE: A pre-tied ligature
was also found at the scene,

54:09.607 --> 54:14.315
which was a common knot
that the East Area Rapist used.

54:14.399 --> 54:16.190
CAROL: There were officers
that said "Yeah,

54:16.273 --> 54:17.732
I think it could've been
the East Area Rapist,"

54:17.816 --> 54:19.732
and others said,
"No, I don't think it was."

54:19.816 --> 54:21.357
MELANIE: That was a huge debate

54:21.440 --> 54:23.524
because we don't know
for sure what happened.

54:23.607 --> 54:27.691
But the idea
that most people believe

54:27.774 --> 54:29.982
is that they encountered EAR

54:30.065 --> 54:33.315
and, uh, they were killed
because of that.

54:35.524 --> 54:37.107
MICHELLE:
And they were just walking?

54:37.190 --> 54:38.941
MELANIE: Yeah. It was so sad.

54:39.023 --> 54:41.524
-They were just married.
-MICHELLE: Hmm.

54:43.232 --> 54:45.023
MELANIE: Whatever they saw,

54:45.857 --> 54:47.816
they had to die for it.

54:50.524 --> 54:53.774
I really did... think

54:53.857 --> 54:55.982
that they were going to--
to catch him.

54:56.065 --> 54:58.941
And it was, um...

54:59.023 --> 55:03.607
a hard pill to swallow
as the years went by,

55:03.691 --> 55:07.691
that he could've gotten away
with these kinds of things.

55:13.649 --> 55:15.816
(CASSETTE TAPE REWINDING)

55:15.899 --> 55:20.482
GAY: I really did think
that they were going to--

55:20.565 --> 55:22.691
-to catch him.
-(TAPE RECORDER BEEPS)

55:24.399 --> 55:26.273
MICHELLE: I mimicked
the bedtime routine

55:26.357 --> 55:27.774
of a normal person...

55:29.524 --> 55:32.440
but after my husband
and daughter fell asleep,

55:33.649 --> 55:36.607
I hunted the killer
with my laptop,

55:36.691 --> 55:40.732
the 15-inch hatch
of endless possibilities.

55:53.065 --> 55:55.107
You know, he stole very
specific things from people.

55:55.190 --> 55:56.899
Not necessarily
valuable things,

55:56.982 --> 55:59.190
but things that meant something
to his victim.

55:59.273 --> 56:01.857
A lot of them were initialed,
monogrammed, things like that.

56:01.941 --> 56:03.524
And in my interviews
with detectives,

56:03.607 --> 56:05.315
I would say, "Have you ever
tried to follow up

56:05.399 --> 56:07.691
and see if these were on eBay
or anything like that?"

56:07.774 --> 56:10.190
And that just wasn't something
they did.

56:10.273 --> 56:13.524
My thinking was, who's to say
some guy didn't die

56:13.607 --> 56:16.524
and you have to clear out
your weird uncle's storage.

56:16.607 --> 56:18.440
Then, suddenly, you've just
put those on eBay,

56:18.524 --> 56:19.857
and we could find that.

56:19.941 --> 56:21.941
So I just started
to keep a list.

56:23.107 --> 56:25.524
The cufflinks,
a family heirloom,

56:25.607 --> 56:28.524
were an unusual 1950s style

56:28.607 --> 56:32.232
and monogrammed
with the initials "NR."

56:32.315 --> 56:35.315
Michelle had been, you know,
late night, bleary eyed,

56:35.399 --> 56:38.607
looking online,
the latest, like, possible clue,

56:38.691 --> 56:41.982
and she had stumbled
upon a pair of cufflinks.

56:42.065 --> 56:43.899
MICHELLE:
The same style of cufflinks

56:43.982 --> 56:46.023
as sketched out
in the police file,

56:46.107 --> 56:47.732
with the same initials.

56:47.816 --> 56:49.357
NANCY: The idea was...

56:49.440 --> 56:50.816
were these the cufflinks

56:50.899 --> 56:53.732
that the Golden State Killer
had stolen,

56:53.816 --> 56:56.273
that then surfaced somewhere
in Oregon?

56:56.357 --> 56:57.982
And if these were
the cufflinks,

56:58.065 --> 57:01.774
then there might be a way
to trace who sold them to whom

57:01.857 --> 57:05.399
and kind of do this, like,
chain of where and how--

57:05.482 --> 57:07.065
where it came from.

57:07.148 --> 57:09.732
MICHELLE: I walked down
the hallway to my bedroom.

57:09.816 --> 57:12.524
My husband
was on his side sleeping.

57:12.607 --> 57:15.440
I sat on the edge of the bed
and stared at him

57:15.524 --> 57:17.315
until he opened his eyes.

57:18.899 --> 57:21.982
"I think I found him," I said.

57:23.565 --> 57:28.190
