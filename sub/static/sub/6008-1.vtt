are almost certainly dead.

- We'll all be in mourning.
- No, I mean with the other thing.

for something in particular.

- We were all so fond of him.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.251

17:06.317 --> 17:09.361
He's Robert's third cousin, once removed.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.947
I have never to my knowledge
set eyes on him.

17:12.031 --> 17:16.702
Ofcourse, ifyour late husband hadn't forced
me to sign that absurd act of legal theft...

17:16.786 --> 17:19.621
My dear, I didn't come here to fight.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.791
Lord Grantham wanted to protect the estate.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.627
It never occurred to him
that you wouldn't have a son.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.548
- Well, I didn't.
- No, you did not.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.676
But when Patrick had married Mary

17:32.802 --> 17:37.472
and your grandson been hailed as master,
honour would have been satisfied.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.475
(SIGHS) Unfortunately, now...

17:40.560 --> 17:43.228
Now, a complete unknown has the right
to pocket my money

17:43.312 --> 17:45.897
along with the rest ofthe swag.

17:46.232 --> 17:50.944
The problem is, saving your dowry
would break up the estate.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.865
It would be the ruin ofeverything
Robert's given his life to.

17:54.949 --> 17:59.202
- And he knows this?
- Well, if he doesn't, he will.

17:59.287 --> 18:04.124
- Then there's no answer.
- Yes, there is, and it's a simple one.

18:05.376 --> 18:10.130
The entail must be smashed in its entirety

18:10.923 --> 18:13.717
and Mary recognised as heiress of all.

18:14.886 --> 18:18.138
- There's nothing we can do about the title.
- No.

18:18.222 --> 18:22.225
She can't have the title,
but she can have your money.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.770
And the estate.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.648
I didn't run Downton for 30 years

18:29.233 --> 18:34.613
to see it go lock, stock and barrel
to a stranger from God knows where.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.281
(SIGHS)

18:36.657 --> 18:38.909
Are we to be friends, then?

18:43.289 --> 18:48.335
We are allies, my dear,
which can be a good deal more effective.

18:52.215 --> 18:56.843
Downton is a great house, Mr Bates.
And the Crawleys are a great family.

18:57.178 --> 19:01.973
We live by certain standards and
those standards can at first seem daunting.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.225
Ofcourse.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.728
Lfyou find yourselftongue-tied
in the presence of his lordship,

19:07.104 --> 19:10.232
I can only assure you
that his manners and grace

19:10.316 --> 19:13.860
will soon help you to perform your duties
to the best ofyour ability.

19:13.945 --> 19:14.986
I know.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.864
Bates, my dear fellow.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.742
I do apologise, I should have realised
you'd all be at luncheon.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.370
- Not at all, my lord.
- Please, sit. Sit, everyone.

19:23.454 --> 19:26.998
I just want to say a quick hello
to my old comrade in arms.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.960
Bates, my dear man, welcome to Downton.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.045
Thank you, sir.

19:33.756 --> 19:37.551
I'm so sorry to have disturbed you all.
Please forgive me.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.769
You never asked.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.943
Thomas, take that up.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.904
Leave it, Daisy! He's a grown man.

19:57.989 --> 20:00.115
I suppose he can lift a meat pie.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.326
Now, put that apple tart in the lower oven.

20:04.579 --> 20:08.373
Oh, and take that away.
Mr Lynch shouldn't have left it there.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.250
- What is it?
- Salt of Sorrel.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.295
I asked him for some to clean the brass pots.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.506
So, put it somewhere careful. It's poison.

20:16.966 --> 20:21.136
Seems like a lot offood
when you think they're all in mourning.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.932
Nothing makes you hungrier or more tired
than grief.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.685
When my sister died, God rest her soul,

20:28.769 --> 20:31.980
I ate my way through four platefuls
ofsandwiches at one sitting

20:32.064 --> 20:34.107
and slept round the clock.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.484
Did it make you feel better?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.945
Not much, but it passed the time.

20:39.030 --> 20:42.741
Oh, my Lord! What was this chopped egg
supposed to be sprinkled on?

20:42.825 --> 20:46.369
- Was it the chicken?
- It was. Take it upstairs now.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.289
- I can't go in the dining room.
- I should think not.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.875
Find Thomas or William
and tell them what to do.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.462
And for heaven's sake get a move on, girl,
before they get back from church.

20:56.964 --> 21:01.635
Well, we've given them a memorial in London
and a memorial here.

21:01.719 --> 21:05.847
MURRAY: I prefer memorials to funerals,
they're less dispiriting.

21:05.932 --> 21:09.017
We could hardly have held a funeral
without the bodies.

21:09.101 --> 21:13.313
I gather they're putting up a stone to
mark those whose bodies were never found.

21:13.397 --> 21:17.442
In fact, I hear the Canadians are making
quite a thing at the Titanic cemetery.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.486
I'm surprised at the number they found.

21:19.570 --> 21:22.948
You'd think the sea
would've taken more ofthem.

21:25.076 --> 21:28.620
So, Murray, what have you to tell me
about the lucky Mr Crawley?

21:28.704 --> 21:30.372
Nothing too terrible, I hope.

21:30.456 --> 21:35.168
(CHUCKLES) I've only made a few inquiries
but, no, there's not much to alarm you.

21:35.252 --> 21:38.254
Matthew Crawley is a solicitor
based in Manchester.

21:38.339 --> 21:39.798
Manchester?

21:40.383 --> 21:42.926
His special field is company law.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.388
His mother is alive and he lives with her.

21:46.472 --> 21:49.391
His father obviously is not. He was a doctor.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.767
I know.

21:51.268 --> 21:54.521
It does seem odd that
my third cousin should be a doctor.

21:54.605 --> 21:57.023
There are worse professions.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.192
Indeed.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.828
Do me a favour. This is supposed to be
sprinkled on the chicken.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.789
- But isn't there more to go up?
- Oh, please, it won't take a moment.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.374
- Go on then, give it here.
- Okay.

22:15.209 --> 22:18.670
MURRAY: We ought to talk about
the business ofthe entail.

22:18.754 --> 22:23.216
As you know, on your death,
the heir to the title inherits everything,

22:23.300 --> 22:27.012
except for the sums set aside
for your daughters and your widow.

22:27.096 --> 22:28.221
Yes.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.390
Owing to the terms of her settlement,

22:30.474 --> 22:33.893
this will include the bulk
ofyour wife's fortune.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.604
(SIGHS) It has been our sole topic
ofconversation

22:36.689 --> 22:37.814
since the day the ship went down.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.693
MURRAY: Ofcourse it must seem
horribly unjust to Lady Grantham,

22:41.777 --> 22:43.445
but that is how the law stands.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.239
Is there really no way to detach her money
from the estate?

22:46.323 --> 22:48.575
Even to me, it seems absurd.

22:48.868 --> 22:53.163
Your father tied the knots pretty tight.
I'd say it's unbreakable.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.456
I see.

22:55.791 --> 22:59.127
Really, Edith, do you have to put on
such an exhibition?

22:59.211 --> 23:00.628
She's not.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.882
I was supposed to be engaged to him,
for heaven's sake, not you.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.217
And I can control myself.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.678
Then you should be ashamed.

23:09.638 --> 23:13.183
Oh, and don't tell me
you've not sent up the egg yet.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.730
Oh, God, help me! Please, God, help me!

23:18.814 --> 23:20.231
Well, what on earth's the matter?

23:20.316 --> 23:22.859
Just run upstairs to the dining room
and find William. I beg you.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.778
- I can't do that now.
- You've got to.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.696
- I'll be hanged ifyou don't.
- What?

23:26.781 --> 23:28.364
Daisy, is that you?

23:28.449 --> 23:31.534
Is it the chicken in a sauce
or the plain chicken with sliced oranges?

23:31.619 --> 23:36.581
Oh, thank you, blessed and merciful Lord!
Thank you.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.792
It's the chicken in the sauce.

23:38.876 --> 23:43.171
I'll never do anything sinful again, I swear it.
Not till I die.

23:46.509 --> 23:49.803
Mr Murray, how lovely to see you.
Do come in.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.847
You're very kind, Lady Grantham,
but I must get back to London.

23:52.932 --> 23:57.352
- But you'll stay for luncheon?
- Thank you, but no, I'll eat on the train.

23:57.436 --> 24:01.815
In fact, ifyou'd be so good as to ask
for the motor be brought round?

24:01.899 --> 24:05.068
But didn't you want the afternoon
to talk things through?

24:05.152 --> 24:08.321
I think we've said everything we have to say,
haven't we, my lord?

24:08.405 --> 24:10.156
For the time being, yes.

24:10.241 --> 24:13.701
Thank you, Murray.
You've given me a good deal to think about.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.416
Mary, try to get everyone
into the dining room.

24:20.501 --> 24:23.795
Edith, make sure old Lord Minterne
sits down.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.717
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- Mmm-hmm.

24:30.553 --> 24:33.638
- They've all gone?
- They have, thank the Lord.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.642
- Oh, what about the lawyer?
- Oh, he was the first away.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.727
Didn't even stay for the luncheon.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.313
I wish they'd make their minds up.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.607
Gwen's put clean sheets
on the Blue Room bed.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.943
Now she'll just have to strip it again.

24:47.027 --> 24:51.156
- Can't you leave it for the next guest?
- Well, only ifyou don't tell.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.740
(CHUCKLES)

24:54.535 --> 24:57.662
So, has it all been settled?

24:57.997 --> 25:00.707
No. I don't know if anything's been settled.

25:00.791 --> 25:03.960
There's a fellow in Manchester
with claims to the title, I gather,

25:04.044 --> 25:07.881
but it's all a long way from settled.

25:08.132 --> 25:11.885
- You mustn't take it personally.
- No, I do take it personally, Mrs Hughes.

25:11.969 --> 25:16.931
I can't stand by and watch our family
threatened with a loss of all they hold dear.

25:17.516 --> 25:21.686
- They are not our family.
- Well, they're all the family I've got.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.526
I beg your pardon.

25:33.407 --> 25:38.036
Do you ever wish you'd gone another way?

25:43.250 --> 25:47.462
Worked in a shop or a factory?
Had a wife and children?

25:48.505 --> 25:49.797
Do you?

25:52.301 --> 25:55.136
I don't know. Maybe.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.096
Sometimes.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.724
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

25:59.808 --> 26:03.311
William's laid tea in the library,
but her ladyship hasn't come down.

26:03.395 --> 26:07.190
Oh, she'll be tired.
Take a tray up to her bedroom.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.943
- Is Thomas back?
- Not yet, Mr Carson.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.033
He asked if he could run down the village,
I didn't see why not.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.103
It's iniquitous.

26:45.187 --> 26:49.232
They can't expect you to sit by silent
as your fortune is stolen away.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.358
Can't they?

26:50.442 --> 26:53.361
His lordship would never let it happen.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.114
How's Bates working out?

26:56.699 --> 26:59.200
Well, I don't like to say.

27:01.203 --> 27:05.456
Only it seems unkind to criticise a man
for an affliction, my lady.

27:06.667 --> 27:09.335
Even if it means he can't do his job.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.386
How are you settling in?

27:19.013 --> 27:22.890
Very well, I think.
Unless your lordship feels differently.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.559
No complaints?

27:24.643 --> 27:27.729
If I had any, I should take them to Mr Carson,
my lord, not you.

27:27.855 --> 27:29.230
(LAUGHS)

27:29.356 --> 27:31.316
You're probably right.

27:32.234 --> 27:36.237
And the house hasn't worn you out
with the endless stairs and everything?

27:36.363 --> 27:40.033
I like the house, my lord.
I like it as a place to work.

27:41.910 --> 27:45.079
- What happened?
- Oh, it's only the old wound.

27:45.873 --> 27:47.999
After I left the army, I'd a spot of bother

27:48.083 --> 27:53.087
and just when I got through that
about a year ago my knee started playing up.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.924
A bit ofshrapnel got left in or something
and it moved, but it's fine.

27:57.051 --> 27:58.343
It's not a problem.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.846
And you'd let me know ifyou felt
it was all too much for you?

28:01.930 --> 28:04.057
I would. But it won't be.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.393
Thomas.

28:08.729 --> 28:11.356
- And where have you been?
- The village.

28:11.440 --> 28:15.735
- To send a telegram, ifyou must know.
- Ooh, pardon me for living.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.077
Well, Murray didn't stay long.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.875
- Does her ladyship know how they left it?
- No.

28:30.959 --> 28:34.462
They talked it all through
on the way back from the church.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.798
If I was still his valet, I'd get it out of him.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.967
- Bates won't say a word.
- He will not.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.722
I bet you a tenner he's a spy
in the other direction.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.767
I wanted thatjob.

28:48.102 --> 28:49.811
We were all right together,
his lordship and me.

28:49.937 --> 28:53.940
Then be sure to get your foot in the door
when Bates is gone.

28:54.066 --> 28:57.652
You can't get rid of him
just because he talks behind our backs.

28:57.778 --> 29:00.113
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

29:01.824 --> 29:05.410
- Perhaps she misunderstood.
- No, it was quite plain.

29:05.828 --> 29:08.413
O'Brien told her
Bates can't do the job properly.

29:08.497 --> 29:09.997
Why was he taken on?

29:10.124 --> 29:13.334
Oh, he was Lord Grantham's batman
when he was fighting the Boers.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.586
I know that, but even so.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.588
- I think it's romantic.
- I don't.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.757
How can a valet do his work if he's lame?

29:19.842 --> 29:21.676
He's not very lame.

29:21.969 --> 29:24.846
There. Anything else before I go down?

29:24.972 --> 29:27.140
No, that's it. Thank you.

29:35.858 --> 29:37.692
Oh, I hate black.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.444
It's not for long.

29:39.528 --> 29:42.447
Mama says we can go into
half-mourning next month.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.031
And back to colours by September.

29:44.158 --> 29:47.702
- Still seems a lot for a cousin.
- But not a fiance?

29:51.707 --> 29:54.375
- He wasn't really a fiance.
- No?

29:55.127 --> 29:58.463
I thought that was what you call a man
you're going to marry.

29:58.547 --> 30:01.632
I was only going to marry him
if nothing better turned up.

30:01.717 --> 30:04.552
- Mary, what a horrid thing to say.
- Don't worry.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.888
Edith would have taken him, wouldn't you?

30:07.139 --> 30:09.557
Yes, I'd have taken him.

30:10.517 --> 30:14.729
Lfyou'd given me the chance,
I'd have taken him like a shot.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.649
I just think you should know
it's not working, Mr Carson.

30:18.734 --> 30:21.152
Do you mean Mr Bates is lazy?

30:21.236 --> 30:25.239
Not lazy, exactly. But he just can't carry.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.074
He can hardly manage his lordship's cases.

30:27.201 --> 30:29.994
You saw how it was when they went up
to London for the memorial.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.579
He can't help with
the guests' luggage neither.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.748
And as for waiting at table,
we can forget that.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.834
- And what do you want me to do?
- Well, it's not for me to say.

30:36.919 --> 30:40.338
But is it fair on William
to have all the extra work?

30:40.422 --> 30:43.758
I don't believe you'd like to think
the house was falling below

30:43.842 --> 30:45.760
the way things ought to be.

30:45.886 --> 30:49.055
- I would not.
- That's all I'm saying.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.234
I'm going down. Coming?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.736
In a moment. You go.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.122
I know you're sad about Patrick.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.458
Whatever you say, I know it.

31:18.085 --> 31:20.127
You're a darling.

31:23.131 --> 31:26.133
But you see, I'm not as sad as I should be.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.636
And that's what makes me sad.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.139
Thank you.

31:32.641 --> 31:35.560
- I'll do that.
- No. No, thank you, my lord.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.645
- I can do it.
- I'm sure.

31:38.981 --> 31:41.941
I hope so, my lord. I hope you're sure.

31:42.150 --> 31:44.485
Bates, we have to be sensible.

31:44.987 --> 31:47.822
I won't be doing you a favour in the long run
if it's too much for you.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.907
No matter what we've been through,
it's got to work.

31:49.992 --> 31:53.327
Ofcourse it has, sir. I mean, my lord.

31:53.996 --> 31:55.621
Do you miss the army, Bates?

31:55.706 --> 31:58.332
I miss a lot ofthings, but you have to
keep moving, don't you?

31:58.667 --> 32:00.668
(CHUCKLING) You do, indeed.

32:02.004 --> 32:05.214
I'll show you, my lord, I promise.
I won't let you down.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.967
We've managed so far, haven't we?

32:08.885 --> 32:10.678
Yes, we have. Ofcourse we have.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.389
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

32:14.516 --> 32:17.393
- You look very nice.
- Thank you, darling.

32:17.519 --> 32:21.564
- Did Murray make matters clearer?
- Yes, I'm afraid he did.

32:31.700 --> 32:35.786
By the way, O'Brien says Bates is
causing a lot of awkwardness downstairs.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.872
You may have to do something about it.

32:37.998 --> 32:40.374
She's always making trouble.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.836
Is that fair when she hasn't mentioned it
before now?

32:44.212 --> 32:46.172
I don't know why you listen to her.

32:46.423 --> 32:51.510
It is quite eccentric, even for you,
to have a crippled valet.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.680
Please, don't use that word.

32:55.057 --> 32:57.975
Did he tell you he couldn't walk
when he made his application?

32:58.060 --> 32:59.268
Don't exaggerate.

32:59.394 --> 33:02.021
Doesn't it strike you as dishonest
not to mention it?

33:02.105 --> 33:04.607
- I knew he'd been wounded.
- You never said.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.401
You know I don't care to talk about all that.

33:07.527 --> 33:11.572
Ofcourse I understand what it must be like
to have fought alongside someone in a war.

33:11.782 --> 33:14.492
- Oh, you understand that, do you?
- Certainly I do.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.244
You must form the most tremendous bonds.

33:17.371 --> 33:19.789
- Even with a servant.
- Really?

33:20.082 --> 33:21.916
Even with a servant?

33:22.084 --> 33:25.211
Oh, Robert, don't catch me out.

33:26.213 --> 33:29.256
I'm simply saying I fully see
why you want to help him.

33:29.383 --> 33:30.383
But?

33:30.467 --> 33:34.303
But is this the right way,
to employ him for ajob he can't do?

33:34.429 --> 33:36.847
Is it any wonder ifthe others' noses
are put out?

33:36.932 --> 33:38.599
I just want to give him a chance.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.109
Mama, I'm sorry,
no one told me you were here.

33:48.235 --> 33:50.653
Oh, dear, such a glare.

33:51.822 --> 33:56.200
- I feel as if I were on stage at the Gaiety.
- ROBERT: We're used to it.

33:56.284 --> 33:59.704
I do wish you'd let me install it
in the Dower House. It's very convenient.

33:59.788 --> 34:02.540
The man who manages the generator
could look after yours as well.

34:02.624 --> 34:07.086
No. I couldn't have electricity in the house.
I wouldn't sleep a wink.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.963
All those vapours seeping about.

34:09.089 --> 34:10.756
Even Cora won't have it in the bedroom.

34:10.841 --> 34:14.051
She did wonder about the kitchens,
but I couldn't see the point.

34:14.136 --> 34:18.305
Well, before anyone joins us,
I'm glad ofthis chance for a little talk.

34:21.643 --> 34:25.813
- I gather Murray was here today?
- News travels fast. Yes.

34:25.939 --> 34:29.942
I saw him and he's not optimistic
that there's anything we can do.

34:30.026 --> 34:34.280
- Well, I refuse to believe it.
- Be that as it may, it's a fact.

34:35.198 --> 34:38.826
- But to lose Cora's fortune to...
- (ROBERT SIGHS)

34:38.952 --> 34:41.245
Really, Mama, you know as well as I do

34:41.329 --> 34:44.415
that Cora's fortune
is not Cora's fortune any more.

34:44.499 --> 34:47.126
Thanks to Papa, it is now part ofthe estate.

34:47.294 --> 34:51.839
And the estate is entailed to my heir,
that is it. That is all of it.

34:52.966 --> 34:57.011
- Robert, dear, I don't mean to sound harsh...
- You may not mean to, but I bet you will.

34:57.137 --> 35:01.891
Twenty-four years ago you married Cora,
against my wishes, for her money.

35:03.351 --> 35:07.688
Give it away now, what was the point
ofyour peculiar marriage in the first place?

35:07.814 --> 35:11.817
If I were to tell you she'd made me
very happy, would that stretch belief?

35:11.902 --> 35:14.320
It's not why you chose her,

35:14.571 --> 35:18.741
above all those other girls
who could've filled my shoes so easily.

35:18.867 --> 35:23.704
Lfyou must know, when I think of my motives
for pursuing Cora, I'm ashamed.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.874
There's no need to remind me ofthem.

35:27.584 --> 35:30.002
Don't you care about Downton?

35:31.838 --> 35:33.714
What do you think?

35:34.716 --> 35:37.051
I've given my life to Downton.

35:37.719 --> 35:40.513
I was born here and I hope to die here.

35:41.223 --> 35:44.517
I claim no career beyond the nurture
ofthis house and the estate.

35:44.601 --> 35:47.186
It is my third parent and my fourth child.

35:47.270 --> 35:50.564
Do I care about it? Yes, I do care!

35:52.567 --> 35:55.027
I hope I don't hear sounds of a disagreement.

35:55.111 --> 35:58.489
(CHUCKLING) Oh, is that what they call
discussion in New York?

35:58.573 --> 36:02.076
Well, I'm glad you're fighting.
I'm glad somebody's putting up a fight.

36:02.244 --> 36:04.411
You're not really fighting Granny,
are you, Papa?

36:04.538 --> 36:08.916
Your grandmother merely wishes
to do the right thing. And so do I.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.252
Dinner is served, my lady.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.421
Does anyone else keep dreaming
about the Titanic?

36:14.548 --> 36:17.800
- I can't get it out of my mind.
- Not again. Give it a rest.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.343
Daisy, it is time to let it go.

36:19.427 --> 36:24.265
But all them people,
freezing to death in the midnight icy water.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.392
Oh, you sound like a penny dreadful.

36:26.476 --> 36:30.020
I expect you saw worse things
in South Africa. Eh, Mr Bates?

36:30.105 --> 36:33.065
Not worse, but pretty bad.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.525
Did you enjoy the war?

36:34.609 --> 36:38.153
I don't think anyone enjoys war,
but there are some good memories, too.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.655
I'm sure there are.

36:39.781 --> 36:42.616
Mr Bates, would you hand me that tray?

36:43.743 --> 36:45.452
(CUTLERY CLATTERING)

36:45.579 --> 36:46.662
(BATES EXCLAIMING)

36:46.788 --> 36:48.831
- I'll do it.
- Sorry.

36:53.795 --> 36:58.215
The ladies are out, we've given them coffee.
The lordship's taken his port to the library.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.968
Anna, Gwen, go up and help clear away.

37:01.094 --> 37:04.513
Uh, Daisy, tell Mrs Patmore
we'll eat in 15 minutes.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.979
(CARSON SIGHING)

37:17.777 --> 37:21.155
Well, I keep forgetting. Does this go
next door or back to the kitchen?

37:21.281 --> 37:24.742
Those go back, but the dessert service and
all the glasses stay in the upstairs pantry.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.535
Put it on here.

37:30.832 --> 37:31.874
What is it?

37:32.000 --> 37:35.169
Her ladyship's told him
she thinks Mr Bates ought to go.

37:35.295 --> 37:39.423
She said to me, "Ifonly his lordship
had been content with Thomas."

37:39.507 --> 37:41.258
Did she really?

37:41.384 --> 37:44.845
- What are you doing up here?
- It's a free country.

37:47.682 --> 37:52.853
Well, I'm going for my dinner.
You two can stay here plotting.

38:04.908 --> 38:09.870
So, the young Duke of Crowborough
is asking himselfto stay.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.705
And we know why.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.250
You hope you know why.
That is not at all the same.

38:16.211 --> 38:19.880
You realise the Duke thinks Mary's prospects
have altered.

38:20.215 --> 38:24.385
- I suppose so.
- There's no "suppose" about it.

38:24.719 --> 38:28.639
Ofcourse, this is exactly the sort
ofopportunity that will come to Mary

38:28.723 --> 38:32.101
ifwe can only get things settled
in her favour.

38:32.394 --> 38:35.646
- Is Robert coming round?
- Not yet.

38:36.106 --> 38:41.068
To him, the risk is we succeed in saving
my money but not the estate.

38:41.820 --> 38:46.490
He feels he'd be betraying his duty
if Downton were lost because of him.

38:47.158 --> 38:50.494
- Well, I'm going to write to Murray.
- He won't say anything different.

38:50.578 --> 38:55.124
Well, we have to start somewhere.
Our duty is to Mary.

38:56.001 --> 39:01.505
(SIGHING) Well, give him a date
for when Mary's out of mourning.

39:04.426 --> 39:07.261
No one wants to kiss a girl in black.

39:10.098 --> 39:14.935
Oh, do stop admiring yourself.
He's not marrying you for your looks.

39:16.604 --> 39:20.190
That's if he wants to marry you at all.

39:20.275 --> 39:21.650
He will.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.318
- I think you look beautiful.
- (DOOR OPENING)

39:23.445 --> 39:24.778
Thank you, Sybil darling.

39:24.863 --> 39:28.282
We should go down. They'll be back
from the station at any moment.

39:30.201 --> 39:35.289
Hmm. Let's not gild the lily, dear.
And Mary, try to look surprised.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.624
You all ready?

39:39.794 --> 39:42.671
Very well. You should go out to greet them.

39:42.839 --> 39:45.799
- And me, Mr Carson?
- No, Daisy, not you.

39:46.176 --> 39:49.178
Can you manage, Mr Bates?
Or would you rather wait here?

39:49.304 --> 39:50.387
I want to go, Mr Carson.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.806
Well, there's no obligation
for the whole staffto be present.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.349
- I'd like to be there.
- Hmm.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.644
Well, it's certainly a great day for Downton

39:57.729 --> 40:00.397
to welcome a duke under our roof.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.151
Remember to help me with the luggage.
Don't go running off.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.277
I'll give you a hand.

40:05.361 --> 40:09.198
Oh, I couldn't ask that, Mr Bates,
not in your condition.

40:09.824 --> 40:14.328
How long do we have to put up with this,
Mr Carson, just so I know?

40:45.527 --> 40:47.444
Welcome to Downton.

40:48.071 --> 40:49.446
Lady Grantham, this is so kind ofyou.

40:49.531 --> 40:53.200
Not at all, Duke.
I'm delighted you could spare the time.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.120
- You know my daughter Mary, ofcourse.
- Ofcourse, Lady Mary.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.914
And Edith, but I don't believe
you've met my youngest, Sybil.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.542
- Ah! Lady Sybil.
- How do you do?

41:02.585 --> 41:05.212
Come on in, you must be worn out.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.215
Oh, Lady Grantham,
I've a confession to make,

41:08.299 --> 41:09.967
which I hope won't cause too much bother.

41:10.051 --> 41:12.970
My man has taken ill just as I was leaving,
so I...

41:13.054 --> 41:15.347
Oh, well, that won't be a problem,
will it, Carson?

41:15.431 --> 41:18.475
Certainly not.
I shall look after His Grace myself.

41:18.560 --> 41:22.729
Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of being
such a nuisance. Surely a footman...

41:22.897 --> 41:24.815
I remember this man.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.526
Didn't you serve me when I dined
with Lady Grantham in London?

41:27.610 --> 41:30.320
- I did, Your Grace.
- Ah, there we are.

41:30.405 --> 41:32.239
We shall do very well together, won't we...

41:32.323 --> 41:34.741
- Uh, Thomas, Your Grace.
- Thomas.

41:35.243 --> 41:36.577
Good.

- Bates, are you all right?
- Perfectly, my lord. I apologise.

What shall we do?
What would you like to do?

42:17.452 --> 42:22.372
- I think I'd rather like to go exploring.
- Certainly. Gardens or house?

Oh, house I think.
Gardens are all the same to me.

42:25.501 --> 42:27.085

which is one ofthe oldest...

No, not all those drawing rooms
and libraries.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.887
Well, what then?

42:38.640 --> 42:43.185
I don't know. The...
The secret passages and the attics.

42:44.646 --> 42:47.522
Well, it seems a bit odd but, why not?

42:48.858 --> 42:52.319
- I'll just tell Mama.
- No, don't tell your mama.

42:52.654 --> 42:53.904
But there's nothing wrong in it.

42:53.988 --> 42:58.408
No, indeed. I'm... I'm only worried
the others will want to join us.

43:16.552 --> 43:19.888
By the way,
I'll be going up to London next week.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.015
Do you want to open the house?

43:22.100 --> 43:24.351
No, no. I'll just take Bates
and stay at the club.

43:24.435 --> 43:28.855
- I won't be more than a day or two.
- I see. Are things progressing?

43:29.941 --> 43:31.566
What things?

43:34.028 --> 43:37.364
It's just a regimental dinner.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.410
It's a pity
Bates spoilt the arrival this afternoon.

43:41.536 --> 43:45.038
He didn't spoil anything. He fell over.

43:45.540 --> 43:48.375
It was so undignified.
Carson hates that kind ofthing.

She says she won't come to tea,
but she'll join you for dinner.

Oh, Carson, I hope you weren't embarrassed
this afternoon.

44:03.057 --> 44:06.268
I can assure you the Duke
very much appreciated his welcome.

I'm glad.

- Is Bates all right?
- I think so, my lord.

44:12.317 --> 44:15.569
It must be so difficult for you, all the same.

44:21.909 --> 44:24.077
- (DOOR CLOSING)
- Don't stir.

44:35.631 --> 44:39.301
Do you realise this is the first time
we've ever been alone?

44:39.427 --> 44:42.679
Then you've forgotten when I pulled you
into the conservatory at the Northbrooks'.

44:42.764 --> 44:44.181
(MARY CHUCKLES)

44:44.265 --> 44:46.308
- How sad.
- No, I haven't.

44:46.434 --> 44:50.604
It's not quite the same with 20 chaperones
hiding behind every fern.

44:52.940 --> 44:55.859
And are you pleased to be alone with me,
my lady?

44:55.943 --> 44:59.821
Oh, dear, if I answer truthfully,
you'll think me rather forward.

45:07.330 --> 45:11.208
I don't think we should pry.
It feels rather disrespectful.

45:11.459 --> 45:12.959
Oh, nonsense.

45:13.544 --> 45:17.130
It's your father's house, isn't it?
You've a right to know what goes on in it.

45:17.215 --> 45:18.340
Where does this lead?

45:18.466 --> 45:21.551
To the men's quarters.
With a lock on the women's side.

45:21.636 --> 45:25.138
- Only Mrs Hughes is allowed to turn it.
- Mrs Hughes...

45:26.557 --> 45:27.974
And you.

45:38.361 --> 45:41.530
- And here?
- A footman, I imagine.

45:49.372 --> 45:50.497
(DRAWERS OPENING)

45:50.581 --> 45:53.500
- Should you do that?
- (LAUGHING) Why not?

45:54.085 --> 45:56.670
I'm... I'm making a study
on the genus "footman".

45:56.754 --> 45:59.005
(LAUGHING) I seek to know
the creature's ways.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.257
- (LAUGHS)
- (DOOR OPENING)

46:00.341 --> 46:02.008
(GASPING) Someone's coming!

46:08.850 --> 46:12.519
- Can I help you, my lady?
- We were just exploring.

46:16.566 --> 46:18.859
Were you looking for Thomas, Your Grace?

46:18.943 --> 46:22.195
No, as Lady Mary said,
we've just been exploring.

46:27.577 --> 46:29.578
Would you care to explore my room,
my lady?

46:29.704 --> 46:32.539
Ofcourse not, Bates.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

46:32.623 --> 46:34.708
We were just going down.

46:36.711 --> 46:38.712
(MARY BREATHING HEAVILY)

46:44.719 --> 46:48.889
Why did you apologise to that man?
It's not his business what we do.

46:48.973 --> 46:53.101
I always apologise when I'm in the wrong.
It's a habit of mine.

46:53.644 --> 46:57.189
The plain fact is Mr Bates,
through no fault of his own,

46:57.273 --> 47:00.734
is not able to fulfil the extra duties
expected of him.

47:01.736 --> 47:07.532
He can't lift. He can't serve a table.
He's dropping things all over the place.

47:08.409 --> 47:11.745
On a night like tonight
he should act as a third footman.

47:12.622 --> 47:17.083
As it is, my lord, we may have to have
a maid in the dining room.

47:17.460 --> 47:20.629
Cheer up, Carson, there are worse things
happening in the world.

47:20.713 --> 47:23.298
Not worse than a maid serving a duke.

47:27.762 --> 47:29.930
So you're quite determined?

47:30.014 --> 47:33.808
It's a hard decision, your lordship.
A very hard decision.

47:34.644 --> 47:38.939
- But the honour of Downton is at stake.
- Don't worry, Carson.

47:39.774 --> 47:43.527
I know all about hard decisions
when it comes to the honour of Downton.

47:43.903 --> 47:45.487
Don't I, boy?

47:50.284 --> 47:53.245
William, you mustn't let
Thomas take advantage.

47:53.329 --> 47:55.830
He's only a footman, same as you.

47:56.499 --> 48:01.670
It's all right, Mrs Hughes. I like to keep busy.
It takes your mind offthings.

48:01.754 --> 48:05.048
What things have you got
to take your mind off?

48:06.384 --> 48:09.886
Lfyou're feeling homesick,
there's no shame in it.

48:10.846 --> 48:14.808
- No.
- It means you come from a happy home.

48:17.353 --> 48:20.480
There's plenty of people here
would envy that.

48:21.482 --> 48:23.149
Yes, Mrs Hughes.

48:31.242 --> 48:33.785
- Will that be all, my lord?
- Yes.

48:35.621 --> 48:37.664
That is... Not exactly.

48:40.668 --> 48:43.169
Have you recovered from your fall
this afternoon?

48:43.254 --> 48:47.382
I'm very sorry about that, my lord.
I don't know what happened.

48:49.010 --> 48:53.722
The thing is, Bates,
I said I'd give you a trial and I have.

48:54.682 --> 48:56.933
If it were only up to me...

48:58.477 --> 49:01.563
It's this question of a valet's extra duties.

49:01.981 --> 49:03.898
You mean waiting a table
when there's a large party?

49:03.983 --> 49:06.651
That and carrying things and...

49:10.948 --> 49:15.410
You do see that Carson can't be expected
to compromise the efficiency of his staff.

49:15.494 --> 49:17.954
I do, my lord, ofcourse I do.

49:18.456 --> 49:20.624
Might I make a suggestion?

49:21.125 --> 49:24.169
That when an extra footman is required,
the cost could come out of my wages.

49:24.462 --> 49:26.796
Absolutely not.
I couldn't possibly allow that.

49:26.881 --> 49:30.925
Because I am very eager to stay, my lord.
Very eager, indeed.

49:33.012 --> 49:36.598
I know you are.
And I was eager that this should work.

49:40.227 --> 49:44.272
You see, it is unlikely that I should find
another position.

49:44.565 --> 49:47.233
But surely in a smaller house,
where less is expected ofyou.

49:47.443 --> 49:48.902
It's not likely.

49:50.279 --> 49:52.113
I mean to help until you find something.

49:52.198 --> 49:57.035
I couldn't take your money, my lord.
I can take wages for ajob done. That's all.

50:04.335 --> 50:06.961
Very good, my lord. I'll go at once.

50:07.338 --> 50:10.090
There's no need to rush out into the night.
Take the London train tomorrow.

50:10.174 --> 50:11.800
It leaves at 9:00.

50:11.884 --> 50:15.178
You'll have a month's wages, too.
That I insist on.

50:21.727 --> 50:26.022
It's a bloody business, Bates,
but I can't see any way around it.

50:26.232 --> 50:28.566
I quite understand, my lord.

50:37.243 --> 50:40.870
I'm afraid we're rather
a female party tonight, Duke.

50:41.914 --> 50:45.792
But you know what it's like trying to balance
numbers in the country.

50:45.876 --> 50:48.545
A single man outranks the Holy Grail.

50:50.214 --> 50:53.758
No, I'm terribly flattered
to be dining en famille.

50:54.385 --> 50:57.804
What were you and Mary doing
in the attics this afternoon?

50:58.889 --> 51:02.934
I expect Mary was just showing the Duke
the house. Weren't you?

51:05.563 --> 51:08.857
- Are you a student of architecture?
- Mmm, absolutely.

51:08.941 --> 51:12.110
Then I do hope you'll come
and inspect my little cottage.

51:12.445 --> 51:14.612
- It was designed by Wren.
- Ah.

51:14.697 --> 51:17.407
- COUNTESS: For the first earl's sister.
- The attics?

51:17.491 --> 51:21.244
Yes. Mary took the Duke up to the attics.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.288
Whatever for?

51:23.748 --> 51:25.331
CORA: Why was this, dear?

51:25.416 --> 51:27.208
We were just looking around.

51:27.293 --> 51:31.463
Looking around?
What is there to look at but servants' rooms?

51:31.756 --> 51:33.423
What was the real reason, hmm?

51:33.507 --> 51:36.718
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
Don't be such a chatterbox, Edith.

51:38.429 --> 51:40.388
I think we'll go through.

51:40.473 --> 51:44.309
- I still don't understand...
- Will you hold your tongue!

51:53.986 --> 51:56.029
How long do you think they'll be?
I'm starving.

51:56.113 --> 51:58.698
- Have you settled the ladies?
- Yes, Mr Carson.

51:58.783 --> 52:01.326
Then it won't be long once they go through.

52:01.410 --> 52:03.578
DAISY: You think he'll speak out?

52:03.662 --> 52:06.456
Do you think we'll have a duchess
to wait on? Imagine that.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.666
You won't be waiting on her,
whatever happens.

52:08.751 --> 52:12.212
There is no reason why the eldest daughter
and heiress ofthe Earl of Grantham

52:12.296 --> 52:15.215
should not wear a duchess's coronet
with honour.

52:15.299 --> 52:18.593
Heiress, Mr Carson? Has it been decided?

52:18.677 --> 52:22.055
It will be, ifthere's any justice in the world.

52:22.139 --> 52:24.557
Well, we'll know soon enough.

52:25.601 --> 52:26.726
What are you doing, Anna?

52:26.811 --> 52:32.106
I thought I'd take something up to Mr Bates,
him not being well enough to come down.

52:32.483 --> 52:36.528
- You don't mind, do you, Mrs Hughes?
- I don't mind. Not this once.

52:36.612 --> 52:39.280
No, take him whatever he might need.

52:40.241 --> 52:43.910
Mr Bates is leaving
without a stain on his character.

52:44.328 --> 52:47.455
I hope you all observe that
in the manner ofyour parting.

52:47.540 --> 52:50.333
Well, I don't see why he has to go.
I don't mind doing a bit ofextra work...

52:50.417 --> 52:52.252
It's not up to you.

52:52.962 --> 52:55.171
I'll take care of his lordship.
Shall I, Mr Carson?

52:55.256 --> 52:57.674
Not while you're looking after the Duke,
you won't.

52:57.758 --> 53:00.885
(CHUCKLES) I'll see to his lordship myself.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.514
(SOFT SOBBING)

53:15.985 --> 53:17.402
(SIGHING)

53:20.030 --> 53:22.323
(SOBBING CONTINUES)

53:32.167 --> 53:35.044
Mr Bates? Are you there?

53:37.590 --> 53:39.048
(SIGHING)

53:51.979 --> 53:55.231
I brought something up,
in case you were hungry.

53:57.276 --> 53:59.152
That's very kind.

54:10.748 --> 54:14.208
- I'm ever so sorry you're going.
- I'll be all right.

54:16.754 --> 54:18.546
Ofcourse you will.

54:19.131 --> 54:22.050
There's always a place for a man like you.

54:22.134 --> 54:25.345
Oh, yes. Something will turn up.

54:29.183 --> 54:31.559
Tell us when you're fixed.

54:32.019 --> 54:34.729
Just... drop us a line.

54:36.357 --> 54:38.149
Else I'll worry.

54:38.984 --> 54:42.028
Well, we can't have that.

54:58.379 --> 55:00.129
(ANNA SNIFFLING)

55:01.590 --> 55:04.133
We must go and let the servants get in here.

55:04.218 --> 55:06.344
I should be grateful
ifwe could stay just a minute more.

55:06.512 --> 55:09.263
I have... I have something to ask you.

55:15.896 --> 55:18.815
I was terribly sorry
to hear about your cousins.

55:18.899 --> 55:20.316
You said.

55:21.068 --> 55:22.110
Did you know them?

55:22.194 --> 55:26.114
Not well. I used to see Patrick Crawley
at the odd thing.

55:27.741 --> 55:31.202
I imagine it will mean
some adjustments for you all.

55:33.747 --> 55:38.209
To lose two heirs in one night, it's terrible.

55:38.752 --> 55:41.212
- Indeed, it was terrible.
- Awful.

55:46.176 --> 55:48.803
But then again, it's an ill wind.

55:50.472 --> 55:54.308
At least Lady Mary's prospects
must have rather improved.

55:55.561 --> 55:57.020
Have they?

55:59.023 --> 56:00.606
Haven't they?

56:01.233 --> 56:03.359
(INHALES DEEPLY) I will not be coy

56:03.444 --> 56:06.029
and pretend I do not understand
your meaning,

56:06.113 --> 56:10.366
though you seem very informed
on this family's private affairs.

56:11.118 --> 56:15.371
But you ought perhaps to know
that I do not intend to fight the entail.

56:15.456 --> 56:17.415
Not any part of it.

56:18.959 --> 56:20.918
You can't be serious.

56:22.129 --> 56:24.672
It pains me to say it, but I am.

56:29.219 --> 56:32.013
You'll give up your entire estate?

56:32.264 --> 56:36.059
Your wife's money into the bargain,
to a perfect stranger?

56:36.226 --> 56:38.061
You won't even put up a fight?

56:38.145 --> 56:41.606
I hope he proves to be perfect,
but I rather doubt it.

56:41.690 --> 56:42.940
Ha.

56:43.817 --> 56:45.735
Very odd thing to joke about.

56:45.819 --> 56:48.362
No odder than this conversation.

56:50.157 --> 56:52.200
So, there you have it.

56:53.202 --> 56:56.496
But Mary will still have her settlement,
which you won't find ungenerous.

56:56.580 --> 56:57.955
(COUGHS)

56:58.207 --> 57:01.626
- (CLEARING THROAT) I'm sorry?
- I only meant that

57:02.252 --> 57:06.172
her portion, when she marries,
will be more than respectable.

57:06.256 --> 57:09.509
- You'll be pleased, I promise you.
- Oh, heavens.

57:09.593 --> 57:12.261
- I hope I haven't given the wrong impression.
- You know very well...

57:12.346 --> 57:15.598
- My dear Lord Grantham...
- Don't "My dear Lord Grantham" me!

57:15.682 --> 57:18.935
You knew what you were doing
when you came here.

57:19.186 --> 57:21.562
You encouraged Mary, all of us,
into thinking...

57:21.647 --> 57:25.900
Forgive me, but I came
to express my sympathies and my friendship.

57:25.984 --> 57:27.401
Nothing more.

57:29.279 --> 57:33.991
Lady Mary is a charming person.
Whoever marries her will be a lucky man.

57:35.077 --> 57:37.453
It will not, however, be me.

57:37.871 --> 57:41.833
I see, and what was it you asked me
to stay behind to hear?

57:45.921 --> 57:47.547
I... I forget.

58:02.146 --> 58:05.356
Well, aren't you coming
into the drawing room?

58:05.691 --> 58:10.194
I'm... I'm tired. I think I'll just slip away.
Please make my excuses.

58:10.779 --> 58:13.948
I'm afraid I've worn you out.
Tomorrow we can just...

58:14.032 --> 58:17.243
I'm leaving in the morning. Good night.

58:20.330 --> 58:22.582
Oh, you might tell that footman...

58:22.833 --> 58:26.335
- Thomas.
- Thomas. You might tell him I've gone up.

58:44.313 --> 58:46.314
So he slipped the hook?

58:48.483 --> 58:51.402
At least I'm not fishing with no bait.

59:00.537 --> 59:02.496
I don't believe that.

59:03.207 --> 59:07.168
Well, believe what you like.
He won't break the entail.

59:08.795 --> 59:11.380
The unknown cousin gets everything

59:12.257 --> 59:15.092
(SIGHING) and Mary's inheritance
will be the same as it always was.

59:15.177 --> 59:17.136
Oh, how was I to know?
When the lawyer turned up, I thought...

59:17.221 --> 59:20.473
You weren't to and you did the right thing
to telegraph me.

59:20.599 --> 59:23.768
- It's just not going to come off.
- So what now?

59:25.854 --> 59:28.814
(LAUGHS) Well, you know how I'm fixed.

59:30.150 --> 59:34.695
I have to have an heiress,
if it means going to New York to find one.

59:37.074 --> 59:38.699
What about me?

59:41.286 --> 59:44.705
You... You will wish me well.

59:45.290 --> 59:48.167
You said you'd find me ajob
if I wanted to leave.

59:48.252 --> 59:49.710
And do you?

59:50.712 --> 59:53.005
I want to be a valet.
I'm sick of being a footman.

59:53.090 --> 59:55.716
Yeah, Thomas, I don't need a valet.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.971
I thought you were
getting rid ofthe new one here.

1:00:00.055 --> 1:00:04.600
And I've done it, but I'm not sure
Carson's going to let me take over.

1:00:08.105 --> 1:00:10.273
And I want to be with you.

1:00:10.816 --> 1:00:11.983
Mmm.

1:00:24.121 --> 1:00:26.998
I just can't see it working, can you?

1:00:28.166 --> 1:00:32.086
(LAUGHING) We don't seem to have the basis
of a servant-master relationship, do we?

1:00:32.170 --> 1:00:35.673
- You came here to be with me.
- Among other reasons.

1:00:39.136 --> 1:00:42.305
And one swallow doesn't make a summer.

1:00:58.363 --> 1:01:01.240
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- What?

1:01:02.909 --> 1:01:05.411
(LAUGHS) Are you threatening me?

1:01:08.540 --> 1:01:11.167
Because of a youthful dalliance?

1:01:11.251 --> 1:01:13.252
A few weeks of madness
in a London season?

1:01:13.337 --> 1:01:15.171
You wouldn't hold that against me, surely?

1:01:15.255 --> 1:01:17.214
I would if I have to.

1:01:22.387 --> 1:01:26.098
And who'd believe a greedy footman
over the words of a duke?

1:01:26.183 --> 1:01:29.560
Lfyou're not careful,
you'll end up behind bars.

1:01:30.062 --> 1:01:31.812
I've got proof.

1:01:33.273 --> 1:01:34.732
Mmm-hmm.

1:01:36.109 --> 1:01:37.818
You mean these?

1:01:43.909 --> 1:01:45.659
(BOTH GRUNTING)

1:01:51.917 --> 1:01:53.584
(THOMAS PANTING)

1:01:54.252 --> 1:01:57.922
You know, my mother's always telling me
never put anything in writing.

1:01:58.006 --> 1:02:00.925
And now, thanks to you, I never will again.

1:02:01.009 --> 1:02:02.468
How did you get them?

1:02:03.095 --> 1:02:06.263
- You bastard.
- Don't be a bad loser, Thomas.

1:02:06.431 --> 1:02:07.932
Go to bed.

1:02:09.309 --> 1:02:11.352
Unless you want to stay.

1:02:40.298 --> 1:02:42.007
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1:02:44.302 --> 1:02:46.595
I think I'll turn in.

1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:49.056
- No big announcement, then?
- No.

1:02:49.141 --> 1:02:52.268
Nor likely to be. He's offon the 9:00 train.

1:02:52.352 --> 1:02:53.811
He never is!

1:02:53.895 --> 1:02:56.689
And when we've had a turkey killed
for tomorrow's dinner!

1:02:56.773 --> 1:03:00.025
- I wonder what she did wrong.
- She did nothing wrong.

1:03:00.110 --> 1:03:02.987
Not from the way his lordship was talking.

1:03:03.155 --> 1:03:06.240
So His Grace turned out to be graceless.

1:03:08.326 --> 1:03:10.411
Good night, Mrs Hughes.

1:03:10.495 --> 1:03:12.455
Good night, Mr Carson.

1:03:15.917 --> 1:03:19.462
Lfyou knew that was your decision,
why put Mary through it?

1:03:19.546 --> 1:03:23.549
But I didn't know it was my decision,
my final decision, until tonight.

1:03:23.633 --> 1:03:28.012
But I find I cannot ruin the estate
or hollow out the title for the sake of Mary,

1:03:28.096 --> 1:03:30.639
even with a better man than that.

1:03:30.724 --> 1:03:33.225
I try to understand. I just can't.

1:03:33.310 --> 1:03:36.353
Well, why should you?
Downton is in my blood and in my bones.

1:03:36.438 --> 1:03:38.063
It's not in yours.

1:03:38.148 --> 1:03:40.191
And I can no more be the cause
of its destruction

1:03:40.275 --> 1:03:42.359
than I could betray my country.

1:03:42.444 --> 1:03:45.279
Besides, how was I to know
he wouldn't take her without the money?

1:03:45.363 --> 1:03:47.698
Don't pretend to be a child
because it suits you.

1:03:47.782 --> 1:03:50.701
(SIGHING) Do you think she would've
been happy with a fortune hunter?

1:03:50.785 --> 1:03:52.578
She might've been.

1:03:52.996 --> 1:03:54.205
I was.

1:03:57.417 --> 1:04:01.378
Have you been happy?
Really, have I made you happy?

1:04:02.255 --> 1:04:03.839
Yes.

1:04:07.552 --> 1:04:10.930
That is, since you fell in love with me,
which, if I remember correctly,

1:04:11.014 --> 1:04:13.516
was about a year after we were married.

1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:16.519
Not a year. Not as long as that.

1:04:17.062 --> 1:04:20.523
- But it wouldn't have happened for Mary.
- Why not?

1:04:21.107 --> 1:04:25.110
Because I am so much nicer
than the Duke of Crowborough.

1:04:25.737 --> 1:04:27.029
I'll be the judge ofthat.

1:04:27.113 --> 1:04:28.906
(ROBERT CHUCKLES)

1:04:30.992 --> 1:04:34.036
Just don't think
I'm going to let it rest, Robert.

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:36.664
I haven't given up by any means.

1:04:38.458 --> 1:04:43.003
- I must do what my conscience tells me.
- And so must I.

1:04:44.756 --> 1:04:48.133
And I don't want you to think I'll let it rest.

1:04:48.927 --> 1:04:50.636
(ROBERT CHUCKLES)

1:05:00.647 --> 1:05:05.234
My lord, would it be acceptable
for Bates to ride in front with Taylor?

1:05:05.318 --> 1:05:07.528
Otherwise, it means getting the other car out.

1:05:07.612 --> 1:05:10.030
He and His Grace are catching the same train.

1:05:10.115 --> 1:05:11.949
Perfectly acceptable.

1:05:12.033 --> 1:05:15.411
And if His Grace doesn't like it,
he can lump it.

1:05:28.967 --> 1:05:31.176
You've been so kind, Lady Grantham.
Thank you.

1:05:31.261 --> 1:05:32.928
Goodbye, Duke.

1:05:33.263 --> 1:05:35.723
You'll make my farewells
to your delightful daughters?

1:05:35.807 --> 1:05:38.142
They'd have been down
ifthey'd known you were leaving so soon.

1:05:38.226 --> 1:05:41.520
Alas, something's come up
which has taken me quite by surprise.

1:05:41.605 --> 1:05:43.063
Obviously.

1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:46.317
Well, Grantham, this has been
a highly enjoyable interlude.

1:05:46.401 --> 1:05:48.736
Has it?
And I feared it had proved a disappointment.

1:05:48.820 --> 1:05:50.029
Not at all, not at all.

1:05:50.113 --> 1:05:52.573
A short stay in your lovely house
has driven away my cares.

1:05:52.657 --> 1:05:56.619
We ought to go, my lord,
if His Grace is to catch the train.

1:05:59.080 --> 1:06:01.540
Goodbye, Bates, and good luck.

1:06:03.168 --> 1:06:05.294
Good luck to you, my lord.

1:06:23.855 --> 1:06:25.189
Wait!

1:06:28.151 --> 1:06:31.403
- Get out, Bates.
- DUKE: I really mustn't be late.

1:06:33.406 --> 1:06:36.700
Get back inside
and we'll say no more about it.

1:06:51.758 --> 1:06:53.926
It wasn't right, Carson.

1:06:54.594 --> 1:06:57.096
I just didn't think it was right.

1:07:14.531 --> 1:07:17.282
- First post, ma'am.
- Thank you, Ellen.

1:07:20.870 --> 1:07:23.789
- One for you.
- Hmm. Thank you, Mother.

1:07:34.217 --> 1:07:38.721
- Oh, it's from Lord Grantham.
- Really? What on earth does he want?

1:07:41.558 --> 1:07:43.892
He wants to change our lives.
