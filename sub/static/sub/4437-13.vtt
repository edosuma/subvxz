is about commanding respect.

they ask for, they'll walk all over you.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.642

05:08.850 --> 05:10.978
I bet you'd make
way more money being nice

than being a big, grumpy grump
to everyone all the time!

more about business than I do?

05:16.650 --> 05:17.947

And glittery stickers!

05:22.989 --> 05:26.163

than you would running this place.

about the way I run my business.

But, if you lose, um, you gotta wear
this "Loser" shirt all summer.

05:49.140 --> 05:53.190
Fine! But if I win, I get to be the boss
for the rest of the summer.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.488

could Stan even make on vacation?
