00:09.008 --> 00:11.141
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

00:13.531 --> 00:17.335
LIEUTENANT: It's been three years
since that fucking freak Dr. Labcoat

00:17.344 --> 00:19.745
detonated the green
bomb that wiped out...

00:19.781 --> 00:23.109
What's up, bud? New York City's
entire human population.

00:23.133 --> 00:25.701
It's a day that's been
dubbed "Green Day"...

00:25.736 --> 00:27.569
no affiliation to the bitching tunes

00:27.605 --> 00:29.337
of Billie Joe, Mike Dirnt,

00:29.372 --> 00:32.273
and... (MIMICS PLAYING DRUMS) Tré Cool.

00:32.308 --> 00:33.710
What's left of New York City

00:33.719 --> 00:37.087
is still impenetrably toxic
to any human life form...

00:37.122 --> 00:39.422
Amigo! Which is why we've built

00:39.457 --> 00:42.325
our Government Response
Center in New Jersey.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.695
That and tax incentives!

00:46.085 --> 00:47.812
Keeping it hard as fuck, Tom.

00:47.891 --> 00:50.602
This whole building is
dedicated to analyzing

00:50.638 --> 00:52.371
and preventing another Green Day.

00:52.406 --> 00:54.005
And again, just to reiterate,

00:54.041 --> 00:56.308
it has nothing to do
with the genre-spanning,

00:56.344 --> 00:59.687
multiplatinum punk alternative
rock trio Green Day.

00:59.709 --> 01:02.776
Wait! What's this "Animals"?

01:02.811 --> 01:05.612
Ah, just the dweebs are monitoring

01:05.647 --> 01:07.580
the effects of the Green Bomb

01:07.616 --> 01:09.937
on the animal population
of New York City.

01:10.008 --> 01:11.908
There's animals in New York?

01:11.943 --> 01:14.844
Oh yeah, tons of 'em.
Weird as shit, too.

01:14.879 --> 01:16.179
There's been animals for three years?

01:16.214 --> 01:17.347
How did I not know about this?

01:17.382 --> 01:18.848
Well, the market's pretty saturated,

01:18.883 --> 01:21.083
it's kind of hard to promote,
and "BoJack" is...

01:21.119 --> 01:25.062
Lieutenant, those animals could be
the key to finding an antidote.

01:25.109 --> 01:28.476
We get threats of another
Green Day on a daily basis.

01:28.512 --> 01:30.145
Yeah, but it's dweeb shit!

01:30.180 --> 01:33.949
I mean, there's a wing right over
there with bombs and nukes...

01:33.984 --> 01:36.554
Lieutenant, might I remind you

01:36.563 --> 01:38.764
of our respective rankings,

01:38.799 --> 01:40.431
you American idiot?

01:40.467 --> 01:43.769
"American Idiot"? That's the lamest one!

01:43.804 --> 01:46.742
- Privates!
- (GASPS) Oh God.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.908
Isn't it funny that yelling
"Privates" in an Army context

01:49.943 --> 01:51.681
is like totally fine but
if you're like in a...

01:51.693 --> 01:54.260
BOTH: Grocery store or
Walmart, you're schizophrenic!

01:54.296 --> 01:56.228
- Dude, I was thinking the same thing!
- (LAUGHTER)

01:56.264 --> 01:57.997
- We are just like...
- Enough!

01:58.032 --> 01:59.658
LIEUTENANT: The general
would like to know more

01:59.674 --> 02:02.208
about your little... animals operation.

02:02.244 --> 02:03.977
MIKE: Uh, sure, I can handle that.

02:04.012 --> 02:06.728
Hello, I'm Private Luciano,
and this is Primate Matarese.

02:06.752 --> 02:09.352
We run a pretty straightforward,
naturalistic observation op.

02:09.387 --> 02:11.487
Through these screens
we monitor the daily lives

02:11.522 --> 02:13.856
of New York City's
posthumanity wildlife.

02:13.892 --> 02:16.259
We do it all day,
every day for three years

02:16.294 --> 02:18.060
and for some reason
we're not allowed to leave,

02:18.096 --> 02:20.062
so we sleep there, we pee there,

02:20.098 --> 02:21.998
and we play, oh, anywhere we'd like!

02:22.043 --> 02:23.572
- Do you wanna be my girlfriend?
- What the...

02:23.588 --> 02:25.488
Do you wanna be my mom? Do you
have games on your phone?

02:25.531 --> 02:27.603
Could I touch your hand?
Sorry. So, so, so sorry.

02:27.628 --> 02:28.783
- What the... I'm sorry.
- What the fuck?

02:28.808 --> 02:30.642
Eat my pussy. Shh.

02:30.940 --> 02:32.072
Do you guys hear a breeze?

02:32.096 --> 02:33.395
What did you just say to me?

02:33.441 --> 02:35.508
- (PUNCH THUDS)
- (GRUNTS, RETCHES)

02:36.166 --> 02:38.197
(GROANS) That hit the spot.

02:38.222 --> 02:39.935
Shut the fuck up!

02:41.939 --> 02:44.009
- Now get back to work!
- Yup. Copy that!

02:44.026 --> 02:45.611
- Copy you.
- GENERAL: Fucking idiots.

02:45.636 --> 02:46.728
Jesus Christ.

02:47.302 --> 02:48.705
I mean, come on.

02:50.199 --> 02:52.174
(BURPS) We really whiffed
that one, didn't we?

02:52.199 --> 02:54.064
- Yeah, we sure did.
- Jesus Christ. What did I say?

02:54.089 --> 02:55.783
MIKE: Oh shit. The general left her pen.

02:56.701 --> 03:00.181
Hey, wasn't Dr. Labcoat's
company called Pesci Co.?

03:00.744 --> 03:02.970
Who gives a shit? What
section are we on today?

03:03.096 --> 03:06.130
- 301, rats?
- Ooh, rats! Oh, what are they up to?

03:06.166 --> 03:08.199
PHIL: I don't know. Shut the
fuck up and watch. Okay?

03:08.235 --> 03:10.134
This is how the episodes start now.
We push in to the screen...

PHIL: I think we make a left here.

03:20.645 --> 03:22.412
I don't even fucking know, dude.
I'm so hungover.

03:22.447 --> 03:24.119
I can't even concentrate.

03:24.130 --> 03:26.031
That's how you know it was
a good Green Day, man,

03:26.066 --> 03:28.166
- when you don't remember shit!
- A great Green Day in the books!

03:28.201 --> 03:31.069
- Yeah! Green Day, dude!
- (PHIL GRUNTS, LAUGHS)

03:31.104 --> 03:33.438
MIKE: The anniversary of
the Green Bomb going off

03:33.473 --> 03:35.040
of course, which eliminated

03:35.075 --> 03:36.463
BOTH: all the humans
from New York City...

03:36.488 --> 03:37.508
PHIL: Yeah, I know this.

03:37.533 --> 03:39.044
MIKE: ...marking the
beginning of a new echelon...

03:39.079 --> 03:40.674
- PHIL: Who are you talking to?
- ...for the animal population.

03:40.682 --> 03:41.648
MIKE: Just a time to celebrate...

03:41.683 --> 03:43.683
BOTH: The resplendent gift of freedom...

03:43.719 --> 03:45.619
- Yeah, I know this.
- By getting blacked-out wasted, fam!

03:45.654 --> 03:47.853
(LAUGHS) All right!
Brought it home! Finally!

03:47.888 --> 03:49.955
Oh shit! Look at this.
What do we got here?

03:49.991 --> 03:51.824
Hey! Make yourself big! Get out!

03:51.859 --> 03:53.259
- MIKE: Hey, get!
- PHIL: Get out!

03:53.294 --> 03:55.314
You get back to Horseburg!
This is Rat Town!

03:55.322 --> 03:56.822
- MIKE: Man, that was a big boy.
- PHIL: Yeah.

03:56.857 --> 03:58.361
To be honest, I kind
of feel bad for them.

03:58.386 --> 03:59.314
PHIL: Why?

03:59.339 --> 04:02.365
Some horses still use horses as horses!

04:02.549 --> 04:03.781
It seems a little backwards.

04:03.817 --> 04:05.850
Hey, but, Mikey, listen. Rats help rats.

04:05.876 --> 04:07.368
But ultimately, it's about helping

04:07.393 --> 04:09.360
the only rat that really
matters: yourself.

04:09.395 --> 04:10.694
Which is why you should keep and hide

04:10.729 --> 04:11.695
all your gold in your basement.

04:11.730 --> 04:13.297
It's my gold. Mine.
It's my gold, you know.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.531
How can a rat help a horse?

04:14.567 --> 04:15.967
- PHIL: Right?
- MIKE: I can't even speak to the horse!

04:16.002 --> 04:17.934
PHIL: It's different languages.
I mean, entirely.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.634
- Oh shit! A public shaming!
- Oh, cool.

04:20.668 --> 04:23.602
Ow! Ooh! Aah! That one hurt.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.571
- Hey, Phil, Mike!
- PHIL: It's Andy!

04:25.606 --> 04:27.073
- MIKE: Hey!
- PHIL: Andy, what'd you do?

04:27.108 --> 04:29.603
Oh, you guys know me,
always saying the wrong thing.

04:29.635 --> 04:31.735
Anyhoo, it's you two
that should be in here

04:31.771 --> 04:33.537
after last night, you crazy bastards!

04:33.573 --> 04:35.773
We don't remember anything
that happened last night.

04:35.808 --> 04:37.970
And we don't know where our car is.
Have you seen our car?

04:37.996 --> 04:39.228
Do you know where our car is, Andy?

04:39.264 --> 04:40.431
It's a 2010 Kia Soul.

04:40.456 --> 04:41.502
Keep walking, boys!

04:41.527 --> 04:42.556
No talking to the prisoners.

04:42.588 --> 04:44.354
MIKE: All right. Stay
strong, all right, Andy?

04:44.390 --> 04:46.856
Yeah! I'll see you guys
later, like if a... Ow!

04:47.721 --> 04:49.315
Oh shit! Dude, there's the red curb.

04:49.340 --> 04:50.406
That's where we parked. Yeah.

04:50.431 --> 04:51.502
This is where it is. Okay.

04:51.527 --> 04:53.642
Hm. Well, I don't see your car anywhere

04:53.656 --> 04:55.789
which begs the
copyright-free question...

04:55.824 --> 04:57.624
Bro, where's my vehicle?

04:57.659 --> 04:59.325
- Where's your vehicle, bro?
- Where is it?

04:59.360 --> 05:00.517
I think it'll be a fun little sendup.

05:00.542 --> 05:01.806
- Nice.
- Oh, empty your pockets.

05:01.831 --> 05:03.689
- Maybe we got clues.
- MIKE: All right. Okay.

05:03.752 --> 05:05.288
- PHIL: Oh shit!
- MIKE: What do you got?

05:05.323 --> 05:07.924
A used bacon-flavor condom wrapper.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.126
- Hey.
- Somebody got lucky!

05:10.162 --> 05:11.494
Oh, check this out.

05:11.516 --> 05:14.517
- Polaroid of a hot babe?
- Whoa!

05:14.552 --> 05:17.174
- Uh... All right!
- Mikey got lucky, too!

05:17.197 --> 05:18.997
Wait. What's that bulge
in your other pocket?

05:19.032 --> 05:21.333
A yo-yo. Yeah, like a sick yo-yo.

05:21.369 --> 05:23.669
- That's pretty cool.
- Let me see if I can walk the dog.

05:23.704 --> 05:25.904
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Actually
that term is speciesist now.

05:25.939 --> 05:29.007
- "Walk the dog"?
- Yeah, it's "Strolling the cylinder."

05:29.042 --> 05:30.742
- MIKE: Hmm.
- Oh, I got one last one.

05:30.777 --> 05:32.650
- A napkin from a nightclub.
- Hmm.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.734
- A place called Balaban's.
- Clearly, we had a crazy night.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.902
- Why would you use a tampon for that?
- No, I know.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.638
- Is that Tia and Lillie?
- From high school,

05:39.673 --> 05:41.306
but we're still friends
with on Facebook.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.939
Yeah. Maybe they know where my car is.

05:42.979 --> 05:44.846
Because it has a string
and it seems fun.

05:44.881 --> 05:46.381
Like, maybe if it was fluorescent.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.417
- Oh, that's cute!
- PHIL: Lillie, Tia!

05:48.452 --> 05:49.927
MIKE: Hey, Tia, Lillie!
What's up, ladies?

05:50.093 --> 05:52.002
- MIKE: How we're doing?
- Oh, it's Mike and Phil.

05:52.027 --> 05:52.963
Oh my God.

05:52.988 --> 05:54.689
Or Phil and Mike,
whatever's easier to say.

05:54.714 --> 05:55.947
Everybody have a good Green Day?

05:55.972 --> 05:57.806
Yeah, we were with you last night.

05:57.901 --> 06:00.302
- You guys were with us last night?
- TIA: Yeah.

06:00.338 --> 06:02.383
By all means, don't skip
a single detail, baby.

06:02.408 --> 06:04.681
Okay, so you both
showed up at Balaban's.

06:04.690 --> 06:06.978
- Great. Nope, not great.
- You started crying. What did they say?

06:07.010 --> 06:09.053
- The cover charge...
- "Ated" all your money.

06:09.089 --> 06:12.525
You both then "butt-chugged"
24 bottles of rosé.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.138
You guys even held hands
at one point and said...

06:14.174 --> 06:16.174
BOTH: "It's like we're married!"

06:16.209 --> 06:18.142
- That doesn't sound like us.
- I'm not too sure...

06:18.178 --> 06:19.869
You kept making the joke,
"Why did they call it

06:19.894 --> 06:22.590
a trash compactor
and not my ass compactor?"

06:22.615 --> 06:24.408
- It's not a good joke.
- It doesn't make any sense.

06:24.433 --> 06:25.681
What about this used condom wrapper?

06:25.706 --> 06:27.838
You were so hungry
that you started chewing

06:27.863 --> 06:29.291
on your bacon-flavored condom

06:29.296 --> 06:31.493
despite many of us
offering you actual food!

06:31.518 --> 06:33.485
You promptly swallowed
the condom and choked,

06:33.530 --> 06:36.203
- like, say, a baby would.
- Like a fucking baby.

06:36.228 --> 06:37.306
I do that sometimes.

06:37.331 --> 06:39.690
But what about this
Polaroid of this hot babe?

06:39.725 --> 06:42.291
- No. That's Dr. Magholis Gupta...
- Oh my God.

06:42.316 --> 06:44.384
...the medical professional
that saved your life.

06:44.409 --> 06:46.556
- TIA: See?
- PHIL: There's little Philly.

06:46.559 --> 06:48.626
They gave Mike a toy yo-yo
because he wouldn't stop crying

06:48.661 --> 06:50.428
and bumming out all the cancer kids.

06:50.463 --> 06:52.396
- I want a yo-yo.
- Get off me! It's mine!

06:52.432 --> 06:53.731
They gave you a yo-yo, Phil,

06:53.766 --> 06:55.466
but somehow you swallowed it,

06:55.501 --> 06:56.967
again, like a baby would.

06:57.002 --> 06:58.830
- Down the hatch.
- We left you both at the hospital

06:58.838 --> 07:00.504
and drove your car back to Balaban's

07:00.539 --> 07:03.142
to kiss cooler boys like Shawn, Hakim,

07:03.167 --> 07:04.800
and Loren Bouchard, the creator of...

07:04.825 --> 07:06.691
BOTH: <i>Bob's Burgers!</i>

07:06.716 --> 07:08.002
- (BOTH LAUGH)
- PHIL: I'm a big fan.

07:08.018 --> 07:09.617
In summation, you both are losers.

07:09.652 --> 07:11.352
There was no mystery to unravel.

07:11.387 --> 07:13.321
Your car is at Balaban's.

07:13.356 --> 07:15.790
The coat check has your keys.
It's that simple.

07:15.825 --> 07:17.525
- TIA: Goodbye.
- BOTH GIRLS: Bye.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.533
- All right, ladies. Talk to you later.
- Peace out!

07:19.557 --> 07:21.232
Did you say, "How we're
doing," to start it off?

07:21.257 --> 07:22.070
I did.

07:22.095 --> 07:23.860
- I'm gonna call a RUber.
- I'll Venmo you half.

07:23.896 --> 07:25.447
Cool. Just remember. I
don't want to remind you.

07:25.472 --> 07:26.486
- Okay. Sure.
- (PHONE DINGS)

07:26.511 --> 07:28.431
Oh! Someone should be
arriving right now.

07:28.466 --> 07:30.700
Mike? Mike? You call for RUber?

07:30.735 --> 07:32.269
- PHIL: Stop screaming.
- Which one Mike?

07:32.304 --> 07:33.603
- Right here, sir.
- Mike, get in RUber.

07:33.628 --> 07:34.860
- PHIL: We're together.
- Get in RUber!

Leave it to Bob Balaban to save the day!

22:42.863 --> 22:43.908
Good ol' Bobby B.

22:43.933 --> 22:47.252
Bob Balaban, you're not
only a character actor,

22:47.277 --> 22:49.705
you're a rat with character!

22:49.730 --> 22:50.845
- Oh. Wow, thank you.
- (RATS CHEERING)

22:50.870 --> 22:52.009
- Give him applause.
- You're hot!

22:52.034 --> 22:53.197
Thank you. That's great.

22:53.222 --> 22:54.549
Okay, guys, you know the drill!

22:54.574 --> 22:56.111
Head here and arms here.

22:56.249 --> 22:57.580
- This feels about right.
- Yeah, I felt like

22:57.605 --> 22:59.877
- we would end up in the stockades.
- Mm-hmm, 100%.

22:59.902 --> 23:01.602
I mean this public shaming
stuff kind of sucks,

23:01.627 --> 23:04.025
but it's better than getting
lambasted on the Internet.

23:07.433 --> 23:08.924
- I gotta get it off my chest.
- Sure. Ah!

23:08.949 --> 23:11.494
You're seriously a Sandler man
over a Carrey man, right?

23:11.519 --> 23:13.166
- Oh, 100%. No question.
- Adam Sandler?

23:13.191 --> 23:15.057
- Adam Sandler has the better career.
- Who are you?

23:15.082 --> 23:17.111
- MIKE: I can make the argument. Ow!
- PHIL: Ah! Fuck!

23:17.136 --> 23:18.291
