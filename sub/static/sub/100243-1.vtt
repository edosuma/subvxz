WEBVTT

03:54.968 --> 03:56.736
At last.

04:07.180 --> 04:11.415
Snoke trained you well.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.251
I killed Snoke.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.186
I'll kill you.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.089
My boy.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.827
I made Snoke.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.697
I have been every voice...

04:25.699 --> 04:27.497
you have ever heard...

04:27.499 --> 04:29.903
<i>inside your head.</i>

04:45.118 --> 04:48.920
The First Order
was just the beginning.

04:48.922 --> 04:53.490
I will give you
so much more.

04:53.492 --> 04:55.226
You'll die first.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.864
I have died before.

04:59.099 --> 05:02.499
The dark side of the Force
is a pathway...

05:02.501 --> 05:06.773
to many abilities
some consider to be...

05:08.375 --> 05:10.442
unnatural.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.922
What could you give me?

05:23.023 --> 05:24.658
Everything.

05:27.426 --> 05:30.529
A new Empire.

05:52.886 --> 05:58.923
<i>The might of the Final Order
will soon be ready.</i>

05:58.925 --> 06:03.163
<i>It will be yours
if you do as I ask.</i>

06:04.264 --> 06:07.065
Kill the girl!

06:07.067 --> 06:08.833
End the Jedi...

06:08.835 --> 06:13.206
and become what your
grandfather Vader could not.

06:16.876 --> 06:20.211
You will rule
all the galaxy...

06:20.213 --> 06:23.016
as the new emperor.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.550
But beware...

06:26.552 --> 06:28.788
she is not
who you think she is.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.359
Who is she?

06:58.151 --> 06:59.185
Are you ever gonna go?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.655
- He can't beat us every time.
- Apparently he does.

07:04.657 --> 07:05.923
How does he do it?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.125
This guy right here?
It's 'cause he cheats.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.993
I'm kidding!

07:08.995 --> 07:10.328
- Oh, come on. Take your turn.
- You're 250 years old.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.763
You're taking forever.
That's cheating.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.064
Of course
you're better than us.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.165
That's why we think
you're cheating.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.336
- Don't worry!
- We're not gonna turn it off.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.307
- He's cheating.
- Definitely.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.675
Klaud, I hope
you fixed that surge.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.583
T-minus five.

07:33.585 --> 07:34.854
Artoo.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.001
Boolio, good to see you.
You got something for us?

07:50.003 --> 07:53.006
From a new ally!
A spy in the First Order!

07:54.074 --> 07:56.140
A spy? Who?

07:56.142 --> 07:57.375
I don't know!

07:57.377 --> 08:00.579
Transfer the message!
Get it to Leia, hurry!

08:02.248 --> 08:04.382
This could be big, Artoo.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.627
<i>Locked on target.</i>

08:16.629 --> 08:18.362
Finn, we're about
to be cooked!

08:18.364 --> 08:19.630
We're almost there!

08:21.201 --> 08:22.600
Poe, we got it.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.068
How do we thank you?

08:24.070 --> 08:25.839
Win the war!

08:32.812 --> 08:34.714
Sorry, I'm sorry! I know!

08:42.956 --> 08:46.192
Finn, you're supposed to be
getting rid of those things!

08:47.227 --> 08:48.228
Ooh!

08:49.996 --> 08:51.562
- I got one!
- How many are left?

08:51.564 --> 08:52.763
Too many.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.832
What?

08:58.738 --> 09:00.071
Good thinking, Chewie.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.739
Finn, we can boulder
these TIEs!

09:01.741 --> 09:03.309
I was just thinking that.

09:16.022 --> 09:17.321
Ha!

09:17.323 --> 09:19.390
<i>Get us back to base!</i>

09:19.392 --> 09:21.125
How thick do you think
that ice wall is?

09:32.071 --> 09:33.273
- Poe!
- I know, I know!

09:37.343 --> 09:38.676
What are you doing?

09:38.678 --> 09:40.411
Lightspeed skipping.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.115
How do you know
how to do that?

09:48.354 --> 09:49.954
Yeah, well,
Rey's not here, is she?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.664
Last jump, maybe forever.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.800
Hold on!

10:14.480 --> 10:16.049
Be with me.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.820
Be with me.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.724
Be with me.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.895
They're not with me. Ugh.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.367
Rey.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.636
Be patient.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.370
I'm starting to
think it isn't possible...

10:39.372 --> 10:41.939
to hear voices of the Jedi
who came before.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.874
Nothing's impossible.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.309
Nothing's impossible.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.146
I'm gonna run
the training course.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.009
<i>No!</i>

12:25.011 --> 12:26.077
Join me.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.878
<i>Join me.</i>

12:27.880 --> 12:29.513
<i>Ben, no!</i>

12:29.515 --> 12:30.581
<i>You killed him!</i>

12:30.583 --> 12:32.085
Ben!

12:45.098 --> 12:46.899
BB-8,
I'm so sorry.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.671
I didn't finish
the training course.

12:52.673 --> 12:54.173
Got distracted.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.847
I'm just
not feeling myself.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.048
I know it looks...

13:04.050 --> 13:06.217
It looks like
I'm making excuses.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.853
Don't tell me
what things look like.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.222
Tell me what they are.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.993
I think I'm just tired.
That's all.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.762
General...

13:16.764 --> 13:18.929
the <i>Falcon</i>
still hasn't arrived.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.601
Commander's asking
for guidance.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.971
I will earn
your brother's saber...

13:26.973 --> 13:28.341
one day.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.477
No, you can't do it for me.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.048
Never underestimate
a droid.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.052
Yes, Master.

13:48.796 --> 13:50.561
Rey!

13:50.563 --> 13:51.998
<i>Falcon's</i> back!

13:53.767 --> 13:55.266
Come on, get over here!

13:55.268 --> 13:56.701
I need a fire crew here!

13:56.703 --> 13:59.069
And another one in the back!
Go, go!

13:59.071 --> 14:00.938
Coming!

14:00.940 --> 14:02.006
It's on fire!

14:03.109 --> 14:04.910
Whole thing's on fire.
All of it.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.177
- It's on fire.
- Hey.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.545
- Hey!
- There's a spy?

14:07.547 --> 14:09.614
Really could have used
your help out there.

14:09.616 --> 14:10.548
How'd it go?

14:10.550 --> 14:12.383
Really bad, actually.
Really bad.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.385
- Han's ship...
- What'd you do to the droid?

14:14.387 --> 14:15.821
What'd you do
to the <i>Falcon?</i>

14:15.823 --> 14:17.321
The <i>Falcon</i> in
a lot better shape than he is.

14:17.323 --> 14:18.556
BB-8's not on fire.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.191
What's left of him
isn't on fire.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.492
- Tell me what happened.
- You tell me first.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.993
- You know what you are?
- What?

14:22.995 --> 14:24.428
You're difficult.
Really difficult.

14:24.430 --> 14:25.864
- You're a difficult man.
- You, you are...

14:25.866 --> 14:27.565
- Rey.
- Finn. Oh.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.099
You made it back.

14:29.101 --> 14:30.468
Yeah. Barely.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.637
- So, bad mood?
- Me?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.207
- Him.
- Always.

14:34.842 --> 14:36.106
Do we have a spy?

14:36.108 --> 14:37.975
Well...

14:37.977 --> 14:39.477
You lightspeed skipped?

14:39.479 --> 14:40.712
Yeah, well, it got us
back here, didn't it?

14:40.714 --> 14:42.146
Poe, the compressor's down.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.547
- Oh, I know, I was there.
- Every time.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.850
You can't lightspeed skip
the <i>Falcon!</i>

14:44.852 --> 14:46.183
Actually,
it turns out you can.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.886
All right, guys,
we just landed, okay?

14:47.888 --> 14:49.119
What happened?

14:49.121 --> 14:50.020
Bad news,
that's what happened.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.055
No spy?

14:51.057 --> 14:52.256
No. Spy.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.658
Did we make contact
with a spy or not?

14:53.660 --> 14:54.926
There's a mole
in the First Order,

14:54.928 --> 14:56.060
and they sent us a message.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.294
You dropped a tree on him?

14:57.296 --> 14:58.395
You blew
both sub-alternators?

14:58.397 --> 14:59.664
Well,
you know what...

14:59.666 --> 15:01.098
maybe you should've been
out there with us!

15:01.100 --> 15:02.032
You know I wanna be
out there with you.

15:02.034 --> 15:03.267
Yeah, but you're not.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.936
You're here training.
For what?

15:04.938 --> 15:06.539
You're the best fighter
we have.

15:07.106 --> 15:08.372
We need you.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.140
Out there, not here.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.575
Junior...

15:11.577 --> 15:12.844
get Artoo
into reconditioning.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.046
It's true.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.449
What's the message?

15:18.451 --> 15:21.185
We've decoded the intel
from the First Order spy...

15:21.187 --> 15:23.122
and it confirms the worst.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.024
Somehow,
Palpatine returned.

15:31.899 --> 15:33.798
Wait.
Do we believe this?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.232
It cannot be.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.367
The Emperor is dead.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.336
Dark science.
Cloning.

15:39.338 --> 15:40.739
Secrets only the Sith knew.

15:40.741 --> 15:42.774
He's been planning
his revenge.

15:42.776 --> 15:46.510
His followers have been
building something for years.

15:46.512 --> 15:49.215
The largest fleet
the galaxy has ever known.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.784
He calls it
the Final Order.

15:52.786 --> 15:56.621
In 16 hours, attacks
on all free worlds begin.

15:57.691 --> 15:59.156
The Emperor and his fleet
have been hiding

15:59.158 --> 16:00.493
in the Unknown Regions.

16:01.327 --> 16:02.729
On a world called Exegol.

16:05.999 --> 16:09.500
Exegol does not appear
on any star chart.

16:09.502 --> 16:14.104
But legend describes it as
the hidden world of the Sith.

16:14.106 --> 16:15.607
There were always whispers

16:15.609 --> 16:18.275
of his hunger to cheat death.

16:18.277 --> 16:20.679
So, Palpatine's been
out there all this time.

16:20.681 --> 16:22.212
Pulling the strings.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.883
Always. In the shadows.
From the very beginning.

16:24.885 --> 16:28.421
If we want to stop him,
we must find him.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.155
Must find Exegol.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.558
General?

16:34.360 --> 16:36.027
Can I speak with you?

16:36.029 --> 16:37.629
I know how to get
to Exegol.

16:37.631 --> 16:39.798
- Tell me.
- Luke searched for it.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.366
For a long time.
He nearly found it.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.703
There are ciphers here
I can't read.

16:44.705 --> 16:47.438
But he said to get there,
you need one of these.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.406
A Sith wayfinder.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.409
They're compasses
that lead the way to Exegol.

16:52.411 --> 16:55.145
To stop what we both know
is coming...

16:55.147 --> 16:57.249
I need to finish
what Luke started.

16:58.217 --> 16:59.684
Find Exegol.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.919
Find the Emperor.

17:00.921 --> 17:03.420
No.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.759
I don't want to go without
your blessing, but I will.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.561
I will.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.531
It's what you would do.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.332
So, you got her
up and running?

17:15.334 --> 17:16.901
You were right before.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.203
I'm gonna pick up
Luke's search for Exegol.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.405
I'm gonna start
where his trail went cold.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.339
The Forbidden Desert
of Pasaana.

17:23.342 --> 17:25.676
Yeah, I know.
We're going with you.

17:25.679 --> 17:27.646
Chewie, you get
that compressor fixed?

17:27.647 --> 17:29.580
I need to go alone.

17:29.582 --> 17:30.915
Yeah. Alone with friends.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.251
It's too dangerous, Finn.

17:32.953 --> 17:34.052
We go together.

17:38.424 --> 17:39.926
I wholeheartedly agree.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.297
Rose, last chance.

17:47.299 --> 17:49.266
The General asked me to study
the specs of old Destroyers.

17:49.268 --> 17:50.669
So we can stop the fleet
if you find it.

17:50.671 --> 17:51.535
"If"?

17:51.537 --> 17:53.607
When.

17:54.741 --> 17:55.742
When.

18:04.618 --> 18:06.185
Hey, we should get going.

18:08.354 --> 18:09.555
What is it?

18:10.189 --> 18:12.189
Nothing.

18:12.191 --> 18:14.959
In the event
that I do not return...

18:14.961 --> 18:16.326
I want you to know

18:16.328 --> 18:18.699
that you have been
a real friend, Artoo.

18:19.565 --> 18:21.367
My best one, in fact.

18:26.173 --> 18:29.208
There's so much
I want to tell you.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.746
Tell me when you get back.

18:54.034 --> 18:55.767
Rey...

18:55.769 --> 18:58.839
never be afraid
of who you are.

19:20.559 --> 19:21.560
It is.

20:09.910 --> 20:11.209
<i>Knights of Ren.</i>

20:11.211 --> 20:12.411
<i>Ghouls.</i>

20:16.116 --> 20:18.616
<i>We have a spy
in our ranks...</i>

20:18.618 --> 20:21.719
<i>who just sent a message
to the Resistance.</i>

20:21.721 --> 20:24.891
<i>Whoever this traitor is
won't stop us.</i>

20:26.159 --> 20:28.660
<i>With what I've seen
on Exegol...</i>

20:28.662 --> 20:31.731
<i>the First Order is about to
become a true Empire.</i>

20:35.101 --> 20:39.538
<i>I sense unease about
my appearance, General Hux.</i>

20:42.976 --> 20:44.408
About the mask?

20:44.410 --> 20:46.911
No, sir. Well done.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.079
I like it.

20:48.081 --> 20:52.382
Forgive me, sir,
but these allies on Exegol...

20:52.384 --> 20:53.584
they sound like a cult.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.620
Conjurers
and soothsayers.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.889
They've conjured
legions of Star Destroyers.

20:57.891 --> 21:00.225
The Sith fleet
will increase our resources

21:00.227 --> 21:01.926
ten-thousandfold.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.262
Such range and power
will correct the error

21:04.264 --> 21:05.897
of Starkiller Base.

21:05.899 --> 21:07.699
We'll need
to increase recruitments.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.701
Harvest more of
the galaxy's young.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.936
This fleet,
what is it, a gift?

21:11.938 --> 21:14.373
What is he asking for
in return?

21:16.977 --> 21:20.612
<i>Prepare to crush
any worlds that defy us.</i>

21:20.614 --> 21:22.347
<i>My knights and I
are going hunting</i>

21:22.349 --> 21:23.984
<i>for the scavenger.</i>

21:33.627 --> 21:34.959
You sure
this is it?

21:34.961 --> 21:36.761
These are
the exact coordinates

21:36.763 --> 21:38.131
that Master Luke
left behind.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.337
What is this?

21:46.339 --> 21:49.173
The Acky Acky
Festival of the Ancestors.

21:49.175 --> 21:53.044
This celebration occurs
only once every 42 years.

21:53.046 --> 21:53.912
Well, that's lucky.

21:53.914 --> 21:55.680
Lucky indeed.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.283
This festival is known
for both its colorful kites...

21:58.285 --> 22:00.552
and its delectable sweets.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.942
I've never seen
anything like this.

22:23.944 --> 22:25.810
I've never seen
so few wayfinders.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.779
There's always random
First Order patrols

22:27.781 --> 22:29.347
in crowds like these.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.782
So, keep your heads
down.

22:30.784 --> 22:31.916
Chewie.

22:37.157 --> 22:39.857
Let's split up.
See what the locals know.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.546
She is saying,
"Welcome."

23:11.191 --> 23:13.725
Her name is Nambi Ghima.

23:13.727 --> 23:16.526
That's an excellent name.
I'm Rey.

23:18.198 --> 23:21.101
She would be honored
to know your family name, too.

23:24.204 --> 23:25.703
I don't have one.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.107
I'm just Rey.

23:46.726 --> 23:49.162
<i>Palpatine wants you dead.</i>

23:50.463 --> 23:53.133
- Serving another master?
- <i>No.</i>

23:54.167 --> 23:56.267
<i>I have other plans.</i>

23:56.269 --> 23:59.203
<i>I offered you
my hand once.</i>

23:59.205 --> 24:00.907
<i>You wanted to take it.</i>

24:02.242 --> 24:03.243
<i>Why didn't you?</i>

24:04.444 --> 24:06.377
You could've killed me.

24:06.379 --> 24:07.881
Why didn't you?

24:09.115 --> 24:11.215
<i>You can't hide, Rey.</i>

24:11.217 --> 24:12.285
<i>Not from me.</i>

24:13.686 --> 24:16.521
I see through the cracks
in your mask.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.056
You're haunted.

24:18.058 --> 24:22.226
You can't stop seeing
what you did to your father.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.628
<i>Do you still
count the days</i>

24:23.630 --> 24:25.165
<i>since your parents left?</i>

24:26.266 --> 24:30.268
<i>Such pain in you,
such anger.</i>

24:30.270 --> 24:32.205
<i>I don't wanna
have to kill you.</i>

24:33.406 --> 24:34.705
<i>I'm going to find you</i>

24:34.707 --> 24:36.643
<i>and I'm going to turn you
to the dark side.</i>

24:38.011 --> 24:40.246
<i>When I offer you
my hand again...</i>

24:41.214 --> 24:42.215
<i>you'll take it.</i>

24:44.184 --> 24:45.185
We'll see.

24:51.357 --> 24:52.690
Has he seen him?

24:52.692 --> 24:54.826
We have to go.
Back to the <i>Falcon.</i> Now.

24:54.828 --> 24:56.696
- Why?
- It's Ren.

24:58.765 --> 25:00.398
Sir,
we've had this analyzed.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.033
It comes
from the Middian System,

25:02.035 --> 25:03.468
Pasaana, Forbidden Valley.

25:03.470 --> 25:04.836
<i>Prepare my ship.</i>

25:04.838 --> 25:06.938
<i>Alert the local troops.
Send a division.</i>

25:06.940 --> 25:09.309
Yes, Supreme Leader.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.478
<i>Freeze.</i>

25:13.480 --> 25:14.679
<i>Hold it right there.</i>

25:14.681 --> 25:16.447
<i>I've located
the Resistance fugitives.</i>

25:16.449 --> 25:17.548
<i>All units, report...</i>

25:23.323 --> 25:24.657
<i>Follow me.</i>

25:32.699 --> 25:34.134
<i>Hurry.</i>

25:35.802 --> 25:38.236
<i>Leia sent me
a transmission.</i>

25:38.238 --> 25:40.905
Okay.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.742
How'd you find us?

25:44.677 --> 25:46.444
Wookiees
stand out in a crowd.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.750
It's good to see you too,
old buddy.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.852
This is
General Lando Calrissian.

25:54.854 --> 25:55.920
We know who he is,
Threepio.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.122
It is an honor, General.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.827
General Calrissian,
we're looking for Exegol.

26:03.363 --> 26:04.931
Of course you are.

26:07.534 --> 26:08.933
Only two were made.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.068
A Sith wayfinder.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.970
Luke Skywalker came here
to find one.

26:12.972 --> 26:15.873
I know.
I was with him.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.211
Luke and I were tailing
an old Jedi hunter.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.012
Ochi of Bestoon.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.246
He was carrying a clue

26:22.248 --> 26:24.849
that could lead
to a wayfinder.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.818
We followed his ship halfway
across the galaxy here.

26:27.820 --> 26:30.054
When we got to his ship,
it was abandoned...

26:30.056 --> 26:33.057
No clue. No wayfinder.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.325
Is Ochi's ship still here?

26:34.327 --> 26:36.227
It's out in the desert,
where he left it.

26:36.229 --> 26:38.529
We need to get to that ship.
Search it again.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.473
I got a bad feeling
about this.

26:49.475 --> 26:52.009
Ochi's ship
is out past Lurch Canyon.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.278
- Go.
- Thank you, General.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.414
You too, Chewie.

26:56.416 --> 26:58.149
Leia needs pilots, General.

26:58.151 --> 27:01.285
My flying days are long gone.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.889
But do me a favor...

27:03.856 --> 27:06.023
give Leia my love.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.559
You should
give it to her yourself.

27:08.561 --> 27:09.829
Thank you.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.339
There!
Those speeders.

27:29.683 --> 27:31.249
How do you know
how to do that?

27:31.251 --> 27:32.984
No need to worry.
I made it.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.056
We gotta go.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.430
<i>We've spotted the fugitives.</i>

28:03.549 --> 28:06.450
Oh! They fly now!

28:06.452 --> 28:07.887
They fly now?

28:08.488 --> 28:09.489
They fly now.

28:33.579 --> 28:35.079
Did we lose them?

28:35.081 --> 28:36.816
- Looks like it!
- Excellent job, sir!

28:39.986 --> 28:41.354
Terrible job, sir!

28:46.459 --> 28:47.960
Not now, BB-8.

29:00.708 --> 29:03.009
Never underestimate a droid.

29:22.830 --> 29:24.030
Poe!

29:28.368 --> 29:29.900
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

29:29.902 --> 29:31.270
Right, ho!

29:45.451 --> 29:46.486
Ochi's ship.

29:47.788 --> 29:49.487
I've seen that ship before.

29:49.489 --> 29:50.622
Rey!

29:50.624 --> 29:51.924
You get all
of them?

30:14.580 --> 30:15.680
What the hell is this?

30:17.150 --> 30:19.483
Sinking fields!
Try to grab something!

30:19.485 --> 30:22.586
Will this agony ever end?

30:22.588 --> 30:23.622
Come on!

30:23.624 --> 30:25.657
BB-8! No!

30:25.659 --> 30:26.725
Rey.

30:26.727 --> 30:28.125
Rey, I never told you...

30:28.127 --> 30:30.029
What? Finn!

30:42.776 --> 30:43.974
General.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.042
We're getting reports
of a raid

30:45.044 --> 30:46.477
at the Festival
of Ancestors.

30:46.479 --> 30:49.079
This mission is everything.
We cannot fail.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.916
Any word from Rey?

30:50.918 --> 30:52.884
<i>Falcon's</i> not responding.

30:52.886 --> 30:54.385
Do you have to say it
like that?

30:54.387 --> 30:55.519
Like what?

30:55.521 --> 30:58.055
Do me a personal favor?
Be optimistic.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.290
Yes, ma'am.

30:59.292 --> 31:01.325
Uh, this is...
This is terrific.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.127
You're not gonna believe how
well this is gonna turn out.

31:03.129 --> 31:05.463
It's gonna be great.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.739
Rey! Finn!

31:14.741 --> 31:16.942
You didn't say my
name, sir, but I'm all right.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.482
- You all right?
- Yeah.

31:24.484 --> 31:25.549
Where's Finn?

31:25.551 --> 31:26.618
Where's Chewie?

31:28.622 --> 31:29.487
I'm good.

31:29.489 --> 31:31.021
Ah.
Master Finn.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.389
What is this place?

31:32.391 --> 31:33.892
This isn't
the afterlife, is it?

31:33.894 --> 31:35.025
Are droids allowed here?

31:35.027 --> 31:36.093
I thought
we were goners.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.528
We might still be.

31:37.530 --> 31:39.065
Which way out?

31:45.071 --> 31:47.104
We have to hurry.

31:47.106 --> 31:48.707
- So, what was it?
- What?

31:48.709 --> 31:50.742
- What you were gonna tell me?
- When?

31:50.744 --> 31:52.309
When you were sinking
in the sand, you said...

31:52.311 --> 31:54.013
"I never told you..."

31:54.948 --> 31:56.080
I'll tell you later.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.015
You mean
when Poe's not here?

31:58.017 --> 31:59.250
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

31:59.252 --> 32:00.317
We're gonna die
in sand burrows

32:00.319 --> 32:01.485
and we're all
keeping secrets?

32:01.487 --> 32:02.787
I'll tell you
when you tell us

32:02.789 --> 32:04.088
about all that shifty stuff
you do.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.358
I do not wanna know
what made these tunnels.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.760
Judging by
the circumference

32:08.762 --> 32:09.928
of the tunnel walls...

32:09.930 --> 32:11.562
I said
I do not wanna know.

32:11.564 --> 32:12.864
Not.

32:12.866 --> 32:14.064
What's that?

32:14.066 --> 32:15.232
- Is that a speeder?
- What?

32:15.234 --> 32:16.567
An old one.

32:16.569 --> 32:18.469
Perhaps we will
find the driver.

32:18.471 --> 32:20.972
Yep, BB-8, I think dead, too.

32:20.974 --> 32:23.507
Oh, my.
A hex charm.

32:23.509 --> 32:24.575
A what?

32:24.577 --> 32:26.912
A common emblem
of Sith loyalists.

32:26.914 --> 32:28.078
Sith.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.380
This was Ochi's?

32:29.382 --> 32:32.751
Luke sensed it.
Ochi never left this place.

32:32.753 --> 32:34.184
And he ended up
down here.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.586
He was headed
for his ship.

32:35.588 --> 32:37.221
Same thing happened to us,
happened to him.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.723
So, how did
Ochi get out?

32:38.725 --> 32:39.726
He didn't.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.429
No, he didn't.

32:45.431 --> 32:46.831
Bones.

32:46.833 --> 32:48.265
I don't like bones.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.637
Bones?
Never a good sign.

32:52.706 --> 32:54.106
Yeah, I see it.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.920
Horrible things...

33:08.922 --> 33:10.154
have happened with this.

33:10.156 --> 33:11.923
There's writing on it.

33:11.925 --> 33:14.291
Perhaps I can translate.

33:14.293 --> 33:17.261
Oh. The location
of the wayfinder,

33:17.263 --> 33:19.496
has been inscribed
upon this dagger.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.333
It's the clue that Master
Luke was looking for.

33:22.335 --> 33:24.368
- And?
- Where's the wayfinder?

33:24.370 --> 33:27.304
I am afraid
I cannot tell you.

33:27.306 --> 33:29.373
20.3 fazillion languages,
you can't read that?

33:29.375 --> 33:31.009
Oh, I have read it, sir.

33:31.011 --> 33:34.178
I know exactly
where the wayfinder is.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.413
Unfortunately,
it is written

33:36.415 --> 33:38.282
in the runic language
of the Sith.

33:38.284 --> 33:39.651
So what?

33:39.653 --> 33:41.820
My programming forbids
me from translating it.

33:41.822 --> 33:43.287
So, you're telling us
the one time

33:43.289 --> 33:44.923
we need you to talk,
you can't?

33:44.925 --> 33:46.658
Irony, sir.

33:46.660 --> 33:48.392
I am mechanically
incapable

33:48.394 --> 33:50.194
of speaking translations
from Sith.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.562
I believe the rule
was passed

33:51.564 --> 33:53.965
by the Senate of
the Old Republic...

33:55.534 --> 33:58.504
Serpent! Serpent! Serpent!

34:10.951 --> 34:13.485
Rey.

34:21.494 --> 34:22.696
- Finn.
- Shh.

34:39.378 --> 34:41.012
- I'm gonna blast it.
- Don't blast it.

35:38.939 --> 35:40.772
I just transferred
a bit of life.

35:40.774 --> 35:42.674
Force energy
from me to him.

35:42.676 --> 35:45.344
You would've done the same.

36:06.933 --> 36:09.500
We cannot possibly fly
in that old wreck.

36:09.502 --> 36:11.035
We gotta keep moving.

36:11.037 --> 36:12.637
Find someone who can
translate that dagger.

36:12.639 --> 36:14.338
Like a helpful droid.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.975
I suggest we return to
the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> at once.

36:16.977 --> 36:18.810
They'll be waiting for us
at the <i>Falcon.</i>

36:18.812 --> 36:20.310
Yeah,
they'll throw us in the Pits of Griq.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.847
Yeah. And use you
as a target droid.

36:22.849 --> 36:25.919
You both make
excellent points, at times.

36:29.956 --> 36:31.024
What is it?

36:32.159 --> 36:33.660
I'll be right behind you.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.561
It's okay.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.740
Let's see what we got.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.644
Let's get
those converters fired up.

36:56.183 --> 36:59.784
What a filthy ship!

36:59.786 --> 37:01.688
Look at that.

37:02.923 --> 37:03.924
Where is she?

37:08.728 --> 37:10.762
Finn,
help me out over here.

37:10.764 --> 37:13.465
Chewie, tell Rey we gotta go.

38:01.748 --> 38:03.348
What's she doing?

38:03.350 --> 38:04.751
Where the hell's Chewie?

38:07.787 --> 38:08.788
It's Ren.

38:24.004 --> 38:25.672
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

38:26.438 --> 38:27.639
<i>Get in the transport.</i>

38:27.641 --> 38:28.842
<i>Move, animal!</i>

39:44.483 --> 39:45.685
Rey!

39:46.186 --> 39:47.251
Rey!

39:48.788 --> 39:51.624
They got Chewie!
They got him!

40:59.392 --> 41:00.491
Chewie!

41:00.493 --> 41:01.728
No!

41:06.598 --> 41:08.134
Rey!

41:10.603 --> 41:12.937
We gotta go!
They're coming!

41:12.939 --> 41:14.505
Rey, come on!

41:17.544 --> 41:19.911
Rey!

41:19.913 --> 41:22.480
- We gotta go!
- Chewie.

41:22.482 --> 41:24.583
Rey, come on!

41:45.638 --> 41:47.273
I lost control.

41:48.508 --> 41:50.041
It wasn't your fault.

41:50.043 --> 41:51.075
It was.

41:51.077 --> 41:53.377
No. It was Ren.
He made you do it.

41:53.379 --> 41:54.881
Chewie's gone.

41:55.648 --> 41:58.182
That power came from me.

41:58.184 --> 42:00.320
Finn, there are things
you don't know.

42:01.521 --> 42:03.389
Then tell me.

42:09.362 --> 42:12.098
I, uh, had a vision.

42:14.734 --> 42:16.703
Of the throne of the Sith.

42:18.204 --> 42:19.706
And who was on it.

42:20.373 --> 42:21.374
Ren?

42:22.876 --> 42:25.278
And me.

42:40.126 --> 42:41.926
We recovered
the scavenger's ship,

42:41.928 --> 42:43.427
but she got away.

42:43.429 --> 42:45.296
Under command
of the Knights of Ren,

42:45.298 --> 42:46.697
we suffered losses.

42:46.699 --> 42:49.400
- A transport was destroyed.
- I've seen the report.

42:49.402 --> 42:51.035
That all?

42:51.037 --> 42:52.770
No, Allegiant General.

42:52.772 --> 42:54.674
There was another transport
in the desert.

42:56.009 --> 42:58.211
It brought back
a valuable prisoner.

43:00.180 --> 43:01.381
Prisoner?

43:06.319 --> 43:09.187
The beast used to fly
with Han Solo.

43:11.157 --> 43:13.224
Take it to Interrogation Six.

43:13.226 --> 43:15.426
<i>Move it.</i>

43:15.428 --> 43:17.028
We've only got
eight hours left.

43:17.030 --> 43:18.429
So, what are we gonna do?

43:18.431 --> 43:20.064
What can we do?
We gotta go back to base.

43:20.066 --> 43:22.033
We don't have time to go back.
We are not giving up.

43:22.035 --> 43:23.768
If we do that,
Chewie died for nothing.

43:23.770 --> 43:25.102
Poe, Chewie
had the dagger!

43:25.104 --> 43:26.470
Well, then we gotta
find another way.

43:26.472 --> 43:28.005
Well, there isn't.
That was the only clue

43:28.007 --> 43:29.407
to the wayfinder thing,
and it's gone.

43:29.409 --> 43:30.708
So true.

43:30.710 --> 43:32.979
The inscription lives
only in my memory now.

43:35.048 --> 43:36.648
Hold on.

43:36.650 --> 43:39.685
The inscription that was on
the dagger is in your memory?

43:39.687 --> 43:41.152
Yes, Master Poe.

43:41.154 --> 43:43.087
But the translation
from a forbidden language

43:43.089 --> 43:44.522
cannot be retrieved.

43:44.524 --> 43:47.659
That is short of a complete
redacted memory bypass.

43:47.661 --> 43:48.960
A complete what?

43:48.962 --> 43:50.428
It's a terribly
dangerous and sinful act...

43:50.430 --> 43:53.431
performed on unwitting droids
by dregs and criminals.

43:53.433 --> 43:54.732
Let's do that.

43:54.734 --> 43:56.500
I know
a black market droidsmith.

43:56.502 --> 43:57.902
Black market droidsmith?

43:57.904 --> 43:59.770
- But he's on Kijimi.
- What's wrong with Kijimi?

43:59.772 --> 44:01.374
I had a little bad luck
on Kijimi.

44:03.009 --> 44:06.077
But if this mission fails,
it's all been for nothing.

44:06.079 --> 44:08.881
All we've done,
all this time.

44:10.883 --> 44:12.819
We're all in this.

44:13.886 --> 44:15.388
Until the end.

44:19.727 --> 44:20.927
For Chewie.

44:22.730 --> 44:24.264
- Hands?
- Hands.

44:25.633 --> 44:26.833
For Chewie.

44:31.605 --> 44:32.805
Kijimi.

45:06.607 --> 45:08.341
Battery charged.

45:09.610 --> 45:10.676
Hello.

45:15.716 --> 45:17.214
Hello.

45:17.216 --> 45:19.052
- Hello.
- No... No, thank you.

45:21.521 --> 45:24.188
Looks like someone
treated him badly.

45:24.190 --> 45:27.091
It's all right.
You're with us now.

45:35.068 --> 45:37.068
<i>U-A-T-T walker patrol,</i>

45:37.070 --> 45:38.670
<i>head down thoroughfare 60.</i>

45:53.787 --> 45:55.920
<i>Open up.
You're wanted for questioning.</i>

46:00.593 --> 46:02.860
<i>Check this side of the street.</i>

46:06.532 --> 46:07.799
<i>Door is locked.</i>

46:07.801 --> 46:09.367
<i>Move on to the next one.</i>

46:09.369 --> 46:11.235
<i>Give me
regular reports, please.</i>

46:11.237 --> 46:13.772
<i>You, up against the wall.</i>

46:13.774 --> 46:16.040
<i>Show me your identification.</i>

46:16.042 --> 46:17.443
<i>Where is your identification?</i>

46:18.612 --> 46:20.378
They're everywhere.

46:20.380 --> 46:22.213
Please, leave her alone.
She didn't do anything.

46:22.215 --> 46:23.749
All right,
I know what we should do.

46:23.751 --> 46:25.416
So do I.
We should leave.

46:25.418 --> 46:27.084
Clam it, Threepio.

46:27.086 --> 46:28.287
Follow me.

46:35.528 --> 46:37.997
All right.
Let's head down this way.

46:39.633 --> 46:41.565
<i>Heard you were
spotted at Monk's Gate.</i>

46:41.567 --> 46:44.636
<i>Thought, "He's not stupid
enough to come back here."</i>

46:44.638 --> 46:46.137
Oh, you'd be surprised.

46:46.139 --> 46:47.639
- Who's this?
- What's going on?

46:47.641 --> 46:49.775
Guys, this is Zorii.
Zorii, this is Rey and Finn.

46:49.777 --> 46:51.575
<i>I could pull this
trigger right now.</i>

46:51.577 --> 46:53.210
- I've seen you do worse.
- <i>For a lot less.</i>

46:53.212 --> 46:56.280
Can we just, uh...
talk about this?

46:56.282 --> 46:58.617
<i>I wanna see your
brains in the snow.</i>

46:58.619 --> 46:59.917
So, you're still mad?

46:59.919 --> 47:01.318
Zorii, we could
use your help.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.120
We gotta crack this droid's
head open and fast.

47:03.122 --> 47:04.321
Pardon me!

47:04.323 --> 47:05.724
We're trying to find
Babu Frik.

47:05.726 --> 47:06.825
<i>Babu?
Babu only works with the crew.</i>

47:06.827 --> 47:08.125
<i>That's not you anymore.</i>

47:08.127 --> 47:09.393
What crew?

47:09.395 --> 47:10.862
<i>Oh, funny
he never mentioned it.</i>

47:10.864 --> 47:13.632
<i>Your friend's old job
was running spice.</i>

47:13.634 --> 47:15.065
You were a spice runner?

47:15.067 --> 47:16.735
- You were a stormtrooper?
- Were you a spice runner?

47:16.737 --> 47:18.335
Were you a scavenger?
We could do this all night.

47:18.337 --> 47:19.871
<i>You don't have
all night.</i>

47:19.873 --> 47:22.239
<i>You know, I'm still digging
out of the hole you put me in</i>

47:22.241 --> 47:24.210
<i>when you left
to join the Resistance.</i>

47:24.912 --> 47:26.310
<i>You.</i>

47:26.312 --> 47:28.012
<i>You're the one
they're looking for.</i>

47:28.014 --> 47:30.147
<i>Bounty for her
just might cover us.</i>

47:30.149 --> 47:32.116
- <i>Djak'kankah!</i>
- Don't <i>djak'kankah.</i>

47:39.225 --> 47:41.358
We could really use
your help.

47:41.360 --> 47:42.562
Please.

47:43.797 --> 47:47.198
<i>Not that you care...</i>

47:47.200 --> 47:48.968
<i>but I think you're okay.</i>

47:49.502 --> 47:50.704
I care.

47:54.708 --> 47:56.507
<i>T-18's online yet?</i>

47:56.509 --> 47:58.077
<i>Yes, sir.
Scouting the perimeter.</i>

47:59.412 --> 48:01.615
<i>Walkers.
Stay close by.</i>

48:03.717 --> 48:06.751
Poe Dameron, spice runner.
Runner of spice.

48:06.753 --> 48:08.519
- All right.
- Get your spice!

48:08.521 --> 48:10.356
- Come on, Threepio.
- Oh.

48:25.204 --> 48:26.605
<i>Babu's in the back.</i>

48:36.850 --> 48:38.417
Don't mind us.

48:42.656 --> 48:46.023
I haven't the faintest idea
why I agreed to this.

48:46.025 --> 48:47.926
I must be malfunctioning.

48:47.928 --> 48:49.595
I must be malfunctioning.

48:50.664 --> 48:51.997
Babu Frik?

48:51.999 --> 48:53.732
Can you help us with this?

48:59.071 --> 49:01.438
Zorii?
Is this gonna work?

49:07.547 --> 49:08.947
<i>He says
he's found something</i>

49:08.949 --> 49:10.247
<i>in your droid's
forbidden memory bank.</i>

49:10.249 --> 49:11.950
<i>Words, translated
from Sith.</i>

49:11.952 --> 49:14.151
- That's it.
- Yeah, that's what we need.

49:14.153 --> 49:16.988
<i>Who are you hanging out
with that speaks Sith?</i>

49:16.990 --> 49:18.556
Can you make him...

49:18.558 --> 49:20.759
Babu, can you make him
translate it?

49:24.330 --> 49:26.063
<i>Yes. But it will
cause a complete...</i>

49:26.065 --> 49:27.666
A complete
memory wipe.

49:27.668 --> 49:29.533
Wait, wait, wait.
We make him translate it...

49:29.535 --> 49:32.069
he won't remember...
anything?

49:32.071 --> 49:34.104
Droid, memory go blank.

49:34.106 --> 49:35.306
- Oh!
- Blank, blank.

49:35.308 --> 49:36.574
There must be
some other way.

49:36.576 --> 49:38.009
Doesn't Artoo back up
your memory?

49:38.011 --> 49:39.343
Oh, please.

49:39.345 --> 49:42.379
Artoo's storage units
are famously unreliable.

49:42.381 --> 49:44.517
You know the odds
better than any of us.

49:46.319 --> 49:47.854
Do we have a choice?

49:53.994 --> 49:56.895
If this mission fails...

49:56.897 --> 49:58.632
it was all for nothing.

49:59.866 --> 50:01.534
All we've done...

50:02.234 --> 50:04.103
all this time.

50:08.675 --> 50:10.343
What are you doing there,
Threepio?

50:11.243 --> 50:14.113
Taking one last look,
sir...

50:14.748 --> 50:16.617
at my friends.

50:19.653 --> 50:20.654
Sad.

50:23.489 --> 50:24.889
Uh-oh.

50:24.891 --> 50:26.691
<i>Night raids
are gonna start soon.</i>

50:26.693 --> 50:28.459
- <i>I'll keep lookout.</i>
- I'm coming with you.

50:28.461 --> 50:31.062
<i>You still
don't trust me, huh?</i>

50:31.064 --> 50:32.229
Did you
ever trust me?

50:32.231 --> 50:33.530
<i>Nope.</i>

50:38.739 --> 50:40.337
<i>Report,
General Pryde.</i>

50:40.339 --> 50:41.673
There's been
a development, sir.

50:41.675 --> 50:43.942
The Knights of Ren
have tracked the scavenger.

50:43.944 --> 50:45.576
To a settlement
called Kijimi.

50:45.578 --> 50:47.912
Shall we destroy
the city,

50:47.914 --> 50:49.248
Supreme...?

50:55.221 --> 50:56.520
I just had an idea.

50:56.522 --> 50:58.288
There's something else
we could try.

51:12.505 --> 51:14.538
How long's it been
like this?

51:14.540 --> 51:17.709
<i>First Order took most
of the kids a long time ago.</i>

51:17.711 --> 51:20.111
<i>Can't stand the cries
anymore.</i>

51:20.113 --> 51:22.179
<i>I've saved up enough
to get out.</i>

51:22.181 --> 51:23.514
<i>I'm going to the Colonies.</i>

51:23.516 --> 51:25.518
How? All those hyperlanes
are blocked.

51:29.455 --> 51:33.091
That's a First Order
Captain's medallion.

51:33.093 --> 51:34.693
I've never seen a real one.

51:34.695 --> 51:36.593
<i>Free passage
through any blockade.</i>

51:36.595 --> 51:38.632
<i>Landing privileges,
any vessel.</i>

51:47.040 --> 51:48.775
<i>Wanna come with me?</i>

51:55.314 --> 51:57.583
I can't walk out
on this war.

51:59.318 --> 52:01.385
Not till it's over.

52:01.387 --> 52:02.823
Maybe it is.

52:04.758 --> 52:07.794
We sent out a call for help
at the Battle of Crait.

52:09.395 --> 52:11.495
Nobody came.

52:11.497 --> 52:13.332
Everyone's so afraid.

52:15.902 --> 52:17.369
They've given up.

52:18.605 --> 52:21.340
<i>No, I don't believe
you believe that.</i>

52:24.111 --> 52:25.977
<i>Hey.</i>

52:25.979 --> 52:29.381
<i>They win by making you
think you're alone.</i>

52:30.416 --> 52:32.351
<i>Remember?</i>

52:35.055 --> 52:36.923
<i>There's more of us.</i>

52:40.660 --> 52:42.994
Squeaky wheel.

52:42.996 --> 52:44.698
I have a squeaky wheel.

52:49.236 --> 52:51.836
Squeak eliminated.

52:51.838 --> 52:53.638
Thank you.

52:53.640 --> 52:54.875
Very kind.

53:01.748 --> 53:04.082
Something's not right
about all of this.

53:04.084 --> 53:05.382
Hmm?

53:05.384 --> 53:06.684
I know
where I've seen it.

53:06.686 --> 53:09.187
The ship he was on.
Ochi's ship.

53:09.189 --> 53:10.622
What?

53:10.624 --> 53:12.458
The day my parents left.

53:13.292 --> 53:14.861
They were on that ship.

53:15.896 --> 53:18.062
Are you sure?

53:18.064 --> 53:19.631
<i>There's an
incoming Destroyer.</i>

53:19.633 --> 53:22.133
We gotta go now.
Did we get it? Babu?

53:22.135 --> 53:25.236
Yep. Droid is ready!

53:29.408 --> 53:31.042
The Emperor's wayfinder

53:31.044 --> 53:32.610
is in the Imperial vault.

53:32.612 --> 53:36.848
At delta 3-6, transient
9-3-6, bearing 3-2...

53:36.850 --> 53:39.284
on a moon
in the Endor system.

53:39.286 --> 53:40.718
From the southern shore.

53:40.720 --> 53:42.588
Only this blade tells.

53:43.422 --> 53:45.091
Only this blade tells.

53:49.461 --> 53:51.129
The Endor system.

53:51.131 --> 53:52.297
Where the last war ended?

53:59.706 --> 54:00.774
Rey!

54:04.244 --> 54:05.442
Ren's Destroyer.

54:05.444 --> 54:06.713
He's here?

54:11.017 --> 54:12.351
Chewie?

54:13.586 --> 54:15.186
What about him?

54:15.188 --> 54:17.121
He's on Ren's ship.

54:17.123 --> 54:18.656
He's alive.

54:18.658 --> 54:20.325
What? How?

54:20.327 --> 54:22.492
He's alive! He must've
been on a different transport.

54:22.494 --> 54:23.962
We gotta go get him.

54:23.964 --> 54:25.129
<i>Your friend's
on that sky trash?</i>

54:25.131 --> 54:26.530
I guess he is.

54:26.532 --> 54:27.899
Might I introduce myself.

54:27.901 --> 54:32.402
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg
relations. And you are?

54:32.404 --> 54:33.570
Okay, that's gonna be
a problem.

54:33.572 --> 54:36.174
Hello.
I Babu Frik.

54:36.176 --> 54:37.644
Why, hello!

54:45.185 --> 54:47.785
Threepio, move your metal ass.
We're almost there.

54:47.787 --> 54:50.021
How dare you!
We've only just met.

54:50.023 --> 54:51.189
<i>Poe.</i>

54:51.191 --> 54:53.590
<i>Might get you
on a capital ship.</i>

54:53.592 --> 54:54.828
<i>Go help your friend.</i>

54:56.129 --> 54:57.729
Zorii, I don't think
I can take this.

54:57.731 --> 54:59.565
<i>I don't care
what you think.</i>

55:02.335 --> 55:04.434
We have to go. Now.

55:04.436 --> 55:06.604
- Come with us.
- <i>Poe.</i>

55:06.606 --> 55:07.705
Can I kiss you?

55:07.707 --> 55:09.009
<i>Go.</i>

55:14.546 --> 55:15.914
We've done nothing wrong!

55:15.916 --> 55:17.382
<i>No sudden moves.</i>

55:17.384 --> 55:19.019
<i>What is that? Stop moving.</i>

55:33.599 --> 55:35.366
Medallion's good.

55:35.368 --> 55:37.335
Clear for entrance
into hangar 12.

55:37.337 --> 55:38.468
Hang on, Chewie.

55:38.470 --> 55:39.971
We're coming.

55:39.973 --> 55:42.541
Whoever this Chewie
person is, this is madness!

55:52.551 --> 55:54.085
<i>Credentials and manifest.</i>

55:55.288 --> 55:56.890
<i>Close the blast doors.</i>

55:59.960 --> 56:02.060
- You three, stay there.
- Happily.

56:02.062 --> 56:03.127
Which way?

56:03.129 --> 56:04.596
Uh, no idea. Follow me.

56:26.186 --> 56:27.685
<i>Drop your weapons.</i>

56:27.687 --> 56:30.688
It's okay that we're here.

56:30.690 --> 56:32.023
<i>It's okay that you're here.</i>

56:32.025 --> 56:33.458
<i>It's good.</i>

56:33.460 --> 56:34.959
You're relieved
that we're here.

56:34.961 --> 56:36.160
<i>Thank goodness you're here.</i>

56:36.162 --> 56:37.261
<i>Welcome, guys.</i>

56:37.263 --> 56:38.629
Does she do that to us?

56:38.631 --> 56:40.633
We're looking for a prisoner
and his belongings.

56:42.402 --> 56:43.603
The cameras.

56:47.841 --> 56:49.575
They said
Chewie's this way.

56:59.786 --> 57:01.019
Rey, come on.

57:01.021 --> 57:03.189
The dagger is on this ship.
We need it.

57:04.157 --> 57:05.158
Why?

57:06.793 --> 57:08.793
A feeling. I'll meet you
back at the hangar.

57:08.795 --> 57:10.063
Rey, you can't just...

57:11.264 --> 57:12.265
Chewie.

57:18.038 --> 57:19.973
<i>Search the city again.</i>

57:22.175 --> 57:24.409
<i>She's close.</i>

57:27.579 --> 57:29.213
Of course
we came for you, Chewie.

57:30.483 --> 57:32.085
Yeah, Rey's here.
She's gonna get the dagger.

57:39.359 --> 57:40.557
Whose ship is this?

57:40.559 --> 57:42.860
The ship's this way.
Follow me.

57:42.862 --> 57:44.064
<i>Over here!</i>

57:45.498 --> 57:47.198
Wrong way!

57:47.200 --> 57:49.202
There's not really
a right way, is there?

57:51.171 --> 57:52.571
<i>I found them.</i>

57:53.740 --> 57:55.008
<i>Blast them!</i>

57:59.045 --> 58:00.311
<i>Over here!</i>

58:00.313 --> 58:01.314
<i>There they are.
Get them!</i>

58:17.197 --> 58:18.763
- We close?
- Straight ahead.

58:18.765 --> 58:19.966
<i>Blast them!</i>

58:22.302 --> 58:24.104
<i>Halt!</i>

58:26.706 --> 58:27.941
Poe!

58:31.311 --> 58:33.044
Are you okay?

58:33.046 --> 58:34.912
Nope.

58:34.914 --> 58:36.814
<i>You there, hands up!</i>

58:36.816 --> 58:38.716
<i>Drop your weapons now!</i>

58:38.718 --> 58:40.218
<i>Put your weapons down!</i>

58:40.220 --> 58:41.886
<i>Drop them!</i>

58:41.888 --> 58:43.723
<i>Drop them now!</i>

58:45.325 --> 58:46.624
Hey, fellas.

58:46.626 --> 58:47.692
<i>Shut up, scum.</i>

59:28.535 --> 59:30.203
<i>No!</i>

59:30.970 --> 59:32.537
<i>No!</i>

59:32.539 --> 59:33.804
No.

59:33.806 --> 59:35.175
<i>Rey.</i>

59:37.410 --> 59:39.076
<i>Wherever you are...</i>

59:39.078 --> 59:40.912
<i>you are hard to find.</i>

59:40.914 --> 59:42.749
You're hard to get rid of.

59:44.350 --> 59:45.883
<i>I pushed you in the desert,</i>

59:45.885 --> 59:47.787
<i>because I needed to see it.</i>

59:48.688 --> 59:50.988
<i>I needed you to see it.</i>

59:50.990 --> 59:53.659
<i>Who you are.</i>

59:53.661 --> 59:55.929
<i>I know
the rest of your story.</i>

59:58.031 --> 59:59.032
<i>Rey.</i>

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.833
You're lying.

01:00:02.835 --> 01:00:05.136
<i>I never lied to you.</i>

01:00:05.138 --> 01:00:06.739
<i>Your parents were no one.</i>

01:00:08.074 --> 01:00:09.475
<i>They chose to be.</i>

01:00:10.644 --> 01:00:11.842
<i>To keep you safe.</i>

01:00:11.844 --> 01:00:13.044
Don't!

01:00:13.046 --> 01:00:14.979
<i>You remember
more than you say.</i>

01:00:14.981 --> 01:00:16.414
<i>I've been in your head.</i>

01:00:16.416 --> 01:00:17.481
I don't want this!

01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:18.617
<i>Search your memories.</i>

01:00:18.619 --> 01:00:19.685
No!

01:00:23.624 --> 01:00:25.523
<i>Remember them.</i>

01:00:25.525 --> 01:00:26.926
<i>See them.</i>

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:32.131
My love.
Rey, be brave.

01:00:34.767 --> 01:00:36.169
You'll be safe here.

01:00:36.704 --> 01:00:38.137
I promise.

01:00:39.872 --> 01:00:41.239
Come back!

01:00:41.241 --> 01:00:42.242
No!

01:00:48.881 --> 01:00:51.249
<i>They sold you
to protect you.</i>

01:00:51.251 --> 01:00:52.216
Stop talking.

01:00:52.218 --> 01:00:54.518
<i>Rey, I know
what happened to them.</i>

01:01:03.196 --> 01:01:04.497
<i>Move it.</i>

01:01:06.032 --> 01:01:07.365
<i>Allegiant General,</i>

01:01:07.367 --> 01:01:08.667
<i>the scavenger is not
with them.</i>

01:01:08.669 --> 01:01:10.870
Take them away.
Terminate them.

01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:17.842
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

01:01:17.844 --> 01:01:20.313
<i>You don't know
the whole story.</i>

01:01:23.816 --> 01:01:27.553
<i>It was Palpatine
who had your parents taken.</i>

01:01:28.756 --> 01:01:31.088
<i>He was looking for you.</i>

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:33.893
<i>But they wouldn't say
where you were.</i>

01:01:34.662 --> 01:01:36.396
<i>So he gave the order.</i>

01:01:40.867 --> 01:01:43.267
She isn't on Jakku.
She's gone.

01:01:43.269 --> 01:01:44.470
No!

01:01:45.838 --> 01:01:47.040
No!

01:01:56.816 --> 01:01:58.251
<i>So that's where you are.</i>

01:02:03.624 --> 01:02:06.424
<i>You know why the Emperor's
always wanted you dead.</i>

01:02:06.426 --> 01:02:07.992
No.

01:02:07.994 --> 01:02:09.429
<i>I'll come tell you.</i>

01:02:15.703 --> 01:02:18.504
<i>She was in my quarters.
Lock down the ship.</i>

01:02:22.508 --> 01:02:23.610
Actually...

01:02:24.977 --> 01:02:26.879
I'd like to do this myself.

01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:32.919
What were you gonna
tell Rey before?

01:02:33.754 --> 01:02:35.519
You still on that?

01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:36.887
Oh, I'm sorry,
is this a bad time?

01:02:38.024 --> 01:02:39.624
Yeah.
Sort of is a bad time, Poe.

01:02:39.626 --> 01:02:41.158
Well, 'cause later doesn't
really look like an option.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.326
If you're gonna let
something off your chest,

01:02:42.328 --> 01:02:43.628
maybe now's not
the worst time to...

01:02:47.867 --> 01:02:49.300
I'm the spy.

01:02:49.302 --> 01:02:51.001
- What?
- You?

01:02:51.003 --> 01:02:52.503
We don't have much time.

01:02:52.505 --> 01:02:53.705
I knew it.

01:02:53.707 --> 01:02:55.206
No, you did not.

01:02:55.208 --> 01:02:56.207
<i>What's your operating number?</i>

01:02:57.877 --> 01:02:59.245
<i>That's not even a language.</i>

01:03:03.049 --> 01:03:05.583
Oh, dear!
My first laser battle.

01:03:05.585 --> 01:03:07.987
- Where are the others?
- They haven't come back.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.393
Find them.

01:03:15.395 --> 01:03:16.996
- Go.
- Yes.

01:03:21.033 --> 01:03:23.134
Friends ahead.

01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:24.568
Oh, yes,
there they are!

01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:25.970
BB-8, come on!

01:03:25.972 --> 01:03:27.238
I'll shut down the
impeders. You've got seconds.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.939
There she is.

01:03:28.941 --> 01:03:30.842
She's a survivor.

01:03:30.844 --> 01:03:32.143
Wait. Wait.

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:34.111
- Blast me in the arm. Quick.
- What?

01:03:34.113 --> 01:03:35.314
Or they'll know.

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:39.283
No! Ahh!

01:03:39.285 --> 01:03:41.087
Why are you helping us?

01:03:41.954 --> 01:03:44.288
I don't care if you win.

01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:46.993
I need Kylo Ren to lose.

01:04:12.251 --> 01:04:15.152
Why did the Emperor
come for me?

01:04:15.154 --> 01:04:17.691
Why did he want
to kill a child?

01:04:18.926 --> 01:04:20.357
Tell me.

01:04:20.359 --> 01:04:22.595
<i>Because he saw
what you would become.</i>

01:04:23.664 --> 01:04:25.531
<i>You don't just have power.</i>

01:04:27.099 --> 01:04:29.200
<i>You have his power.</i>

01:04:29.202 --> 01:04:30.503
<i>You're his granddaughter.</i>

01:04:32.205 --> 01:04:35.508
<i>You are a Palpatine.</i>

01:04:43.249 --> 01:04:45.983
<i>My mother
was the daughter of Vader.</i>

01:04:45.985 --> 01:04:49.153
<i>Your father
was the son of the Emperor.</i>

01:04:49.155 --> 01:04:51.088
<i>What Palpatine
doesn't know</i>

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:53.692
<i>is we're a dyad
in the Force, Rey.</i>

01:04:53.694 --> 01:04:55.660
<i>Two that are one.</i>

01:05:03.202 --> 01:05:08.038
<i>We'll kill him together
and take the throne.</i>

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:19.118
You know
what you need to do.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.454
You know.

01:05:30.429 --> 01:05:31.830
I do.

01:05:39.171 --> 01:05:40.573
Hold her steady.

01:05:45.111 --> 01:05:46.312
Finn, move fast!

01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:49.146
Rey!

01:05:49.148 --> 01:05:51.181
Come on!

01:05:55.154 --> 01:05:56.487
Come on!
I got you!

01:06:04.597 --> 01:06:08.132
It was a coordinated
incursion, Allegiant General.

01:06:08.134 --> 01:06:09.533
They overpowered the guards

01:06:09.535 --> 01:06:11.270
and forced me
to take them to their ship.

01:06:11.772 --> 01:06:13.805
I see.

01:06:13.807 --> 01:06:15.172
Get me the Supreme Leader.

01:06:15.174 --> 01:06:16.342
Yes, sir.

01:06:20.379 --> 01:06:22.548
Tell him we found our spy.

01:06:25.418 --> 01:06:27.151
I don't know why
they're not following us,

01:06:27.153 --> 01:06:28.218
but I don't trust it.

01:06:29.488 --> 01:06:31.121
Landing gear's busted?
How busted?

01:06:32.859 --> 01:06:35.860
All that matters is the wayfinder.
Finding Exegol.

01:06:35.862 --> 01:06:37.530
That's what we're doing.

01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:44.236
He killed my mother.

01:06:45.639 --> 01:06:47.473
And my father.

01:06:49.508 --> 01:06:51.612
I'm going to find
Palpatine...

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.480
and destroy him.

01:06:56.115 --> 01:06:57.849
Rey...

01:06:57.851 --> 01:06:59.385
that doesn't sound
like you.

01:07:01.722 --> 01:07:03.354
Rey, I know you...

01:07:03.356 --> 01:07:05.358
People keep telling me
they know me.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.629
I'm afraid no one does.

01:07:13.867 --> 01:07:18.435
<i>The Jedi
apprentice still lives.</i>

01:07:18.437 --> 01:07:22.439
<i>Perhaps you
have betrayed me.</i>

01:07:22.441 --> 01:07:26.611
<i>Do not make me
turn my fleet against you.</i>

01:07:26.613 --> 01:07:28.813
<i>I know where she's going.</i>

01:07:28.815 --> 01:07:30.147
<i>She'll never be a Jedi.</i>

01:07:30.149 --> 01:07:31.816
<i>Make sure of it.</i>

01:07:31.818 --> 01:07:33.219
<i>Kill her.</i>

01:08:15.361 --> 01:08:17.062
What...
What is that?

01:08:17.064 --> 01:08:18.362
It's the Death Star.

01:08:18.363 --> 01:08:21.765
A bad place
from an old war.

01:08:21.768 --> 01:08:24.368
It's gonna take us years to
find what we're looking for.

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:26.470
Oh, dear.

01:08:26.471 --> 01:08:28.608
"Only this blade tells."

01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:05.242
The wayfinder's there.

01:09:05.243 --> 01:09:06.479
Heads up.

01:09:13.953 --> 01:09:15.352
Rough landing.

01:09:15.354 --> 01:09:17.555
- I've seen worse.
- I've seen better.

01:09:19.457 --> 01:09:20.992
Are you Resistance?

01:09:20.993 --> 01:09:22.660
That depends.

01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:24.996
We picked up a transmission
from someone named Babu Frik.

01:09:24.997 --> 01:09:28.600
Babu Frik? Oh,
he's one of my oldest friends.

01:09:28.602 --> 01:09:30.201
He said you'd come.

01:09:30.203 --> 01:09:32.005
He said
you were the last hope.

01:09:33.774 --> 01:09:35.439
We have to get to that wreck.

01:09:35.441 --> 01:09:37.242
There is something
inside there we need.

01:09:37.243 --> 01:09:38.710
I can take you there
by water.

01:09:38.712 --> 01:09:40.812
- Have you seen the water?
- Not now.

01:09:40.814 --> 01:09:42.379
Too dangerous.

01:09:42.381 --> 01:09:43.747
We can go
first light tomorrow.

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:46.019
We can't wait that long.
We don't have the time.

01:09:46.987 --> 01:09:48.752
Or the choice.

01:09:48.755 --> 01:09:50.554
Let's get that ship fixed.

01:09:50.555 --> 01:09:51.990
Do you have any spare parts?

01:09:51.992 --> 01:09:53.158
Some.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.628
- I'm Jannah.
- I'm Poe.

01:10:04.503 --> 01:10:05.705
Hello.

01:10:07.974 --> 01:10:10.474
No, thank you. No, thank you.

01:10:10.476 --> 01:10:12.409
What a dreadful situation.

01:10:12.411 --> 01:10:14.879
Is every day like this
for you people?

01:10:14.881 --> 01:10:15.980
Madness.

01:10:15.982 --> 01:10:18.850
Did we ever find
his volume control?

01:10:18.852 --> 01:10:21.152
It's an O-6,
but should work.

01:10:21.154 --> 01:10:22.488
Thank you.

01:10:24.658 --> 01:10:26.157
This is a First Order part.

01:10:26.159 --> 01:10:28.193
There's an old cruiser
on the west ridge.

01:10:28.195 --> 01:10:29.495
Stripped for parts.

01:10:30.496 --> 01:10:32.362
The one we were assigned to.

01:10:32.364 --> 01:10:34.464
The one we escaped in.

01:10:34.466 --> 01:10:37.936
Okay, wait.
You were First Order?

01:10:37.938 --> 01:10:38.972
Not by choice.

01:10:41.641 --> 01:10:44.510
We were conscripted
as kids. All of us.

01:10:45.377 --> 01:10:48.246
I was TZ-1719.
Stormtrooper.

01:10:48.248 --> 01:10:49.649
FN-2187.

01:10:50.717 --> 01:10:51.683
You?

01:10:51.685 --> 01:10:53.151
I never knew
there were more.

01:10:53.153 --> 01:10:56.520
Deserters? All of us here
were stormtroopers.

01:10:56.522 --> 01:10:59.356
We mutinied at the battle
of Ansett Island.

01:10:59.358 --> 01:11:01.491
They told us
to fire on civilians.

01:11:01.493 --> 01:11:02.660
We wouldn't do it.

01:11:02.662 --> 01:11:04.561
We laid our weapons down.

01:11:04.563 --> 01:11:06.430
- All of you?
- The whole company.

01:11:07.934 --> 01:11:11.135
I don't even know
how it happened.

01:11:11.137 --> 01:11:14.005
It wasn't a decision, really,
it was like...

01:11:14.007 --> 01:11:15.041
An instinct.

01:11:16.109 --> 01:11:17.376
Feeling.

01:11:18.011 --> 01:11:19.378
A feeling.

01:11:20.347 --> 01:11:22.379
The Force.

01:11:22.381 --> 01:11:24.017
The Force
brought me here.

01:11:25.285 --> 01:11:28.920
It brought me to Rey.
And Poe.

01:11:28.922 --> 01:11:31.423
You say that
like you're sure it's real.

01:11:32.192 --> 01:11:34.125
It's real.

01:11:34.127 --> 01:11:35.729
I wasn't sure then...

01:11:37.631 --> 01:11:39.964
but I am now.

01:11:39.966 --> 01:11:41.531
What is it, buddy?

01:11:43.904 --> 01:11:45.739
What do you mean
you haven't seen her?

01:12:01.054 --> 01:12:02.554
She took the skimmer?

01:12:37.523 --> 01:12:38.756
What the hell
was she thinking?

01:12:38.758 --> 01:12:40.792
Poe, we gotta go
after her.

01:12:40.794 --> 01:12:42.093
We'll get
the <i>Falcon</i> fixed,

01:12:42.095 --> 01:12:43.527
and get out there
as fast as we can.

01:12:43.529 --> 01:12:45.096
No,
we're gonna lose her.

01:12:45.098 --> 01:12:46.197
Look, she left us!
What do you wanna do? Swim?

01:12:46.199 --> 01:12:47.365
She's not herself.

01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:48.565
You have no idea
what she's fighting.

01:12:48.567 --> 01:12:49.769
And you do?

01:12:52.005 --> 01:12:54.105
Yeah, I do.

01:12:54.107 --> 01:12:55.141
And so does Leia.

01:12:56.276 --> 01:12:58.309
Well, I'm not Leia.

01:12:58.311 --> 01:12:59.813
That's for damn sure.

01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:24.671
Finn.

01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:26.806
There's another skimmer.

01:16:16.776 --> 01:16:19.212
Don't be afraid
of who you are.

01:16:53.313 --> 01:16:56.380
Look at yourself.

01:16:56.382 --> 01:16:58.449
You wanted to prove to my
mother that you were a Jedi...

01:16:58.451 --> 01:17:00.320
but you've proven
something else.

01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:05.858
You can't go back to her now.

01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:09.095
Like I can't.

01:17:11.331 --> 01:17:12.396
Give it to me.

01:17:16.035 --> 01:17:19.005
The dark side
is in our nature.

01:17:22.008 --> 01:17:23.376
Surrender to it.

01:17:24.344 --> 01:17:25.411
Give it...

01:17:26.112 --> 01:17:27.646
to me.

01:17:33.419 --> 01:17:37.123
The only way you're getting
to Exegol is with me.

01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:40.024
No!

01:18:12.992 --> 01:18:16.129
Leia knows
what must be done, Artoo.

01:18:16.896 --> 01:18:19.130
To reach her son now...

01:18:19.132 --> 01:18:22.835
will take all the strength
she has left.

01:18:42.889 --> 01:18:44.290
Rey!

01:18:46.459 --> 01:18:47.994
Rey!

01:18:49.462 --> 01:18:50.863
No!

01:19:23.697 --> 01:19:25.996
No, we can't follow them!

01:19:25.998 --> 01:19:28.067
- I can't leave her!
- We can't!

01:19:28.736 --> 01:19:30.203
Rey!

01:21:08.067 --> 01:21:10.069
Ben.

01:21:40.299 --> 01:21:41.300
Leia.

01:22:59.345 --> 01:23:01.715
I did want
to take your hand.

01:23:03.182 --> 01:23:04.785
Ben's hand.

01:23:46.893 --> 01:23:50.262
Goodbye, dear princess.

01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:03.975
Poe,
something's happened.

01:24:03.977 --> 01:24:05.509
- Finn.
- This can't wait.

01:24:05.511 --> 01:24:07.480
We've gotta see
the General.

01:24:09.248 --> 01:24:10.449
She's gone.

01:24:16.555 --> 01:24:17.856
Chewie...

01:24:43.249 --> 01:24:44.685
Hey, kid.

01:25:05.772 --> 01:25:07.005
I miss you, son.

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:11.375
Your son is dead.

01:25:12.746 --> 01:25:13.814
No.

01:25:18.785 --> 01:25:20.987
Kylo Ren is dead.

01:25:23.222 --> 01:25:24.858
My son is alive.

01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:31.898
You're just a memory.

01:25:33.365 --> 01:25:35.301
Your memory.

01:25:39.271 --> 01:25:40.807
Come home.

01:25:42.008 --> 01:25:43.542
It's too late.

01:25:46.378 --> 01:25:47.814
She's gone.

01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:52.717
Your mother's gone.

01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:55.554
But what she stood for,
what she fought for...

01:25:57.023 --> 01:25:58.524
that's not gone.

01:26:05.065 --> 01:26:06.831
Ben.

01:26:06.833 --> 01:26:08.532
I know
what I have to do...

01:26:08.534 --> 01:26:10.536
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

01:26:20.881 --> 01:26:22.616
You do.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.928
Dad...

01:26:40.399 --> 01:26:42.301
I know.

01:27:02.856 --> 01:27:07.125
<i>The Princess of Alderaan
has disrupted my plan...</i>

01:27:07.127 --> 01:27:11.528
<i>but her foolish act
will be in vain.</i>

01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:15.534
<i>Come to me on Exegol,
General Pryde.</i>

01:27:17.737 --> 01:27:20.305
As I served you
in the old wars,

01:27:20.307 --> 01:27:21.973
I serve you now.

01:27:21.975 --> 01:27:26.410
<i>Send a ship
to a world they know.</i>

01:27:26.412 --> 01:27:28.980
<i>Let it burn.</i>

01:27:28.982 --> 01:27:31.582
<i>The Final Order begins.</i>

01:27:31.584 --> 01:27:36.221
<i>She will come,
her friends will follow.</i>

01:27:36.223 --> 01:27:37.657
Yes, my lord.

01:27:47.801 --> 01:27:50.837
Levels
holding steady at 85%.

01:27:52.072 --> 01:27:54.105
Captain.

01:27:54.107 --> 01:27:56.575
- Kijimi is in range.
- Fire.

01:28:15.762 --> 01:28:19.364
<i>Kijimi? How?</i>

01:28:19.366 --> 01:28:21.833
A blast
from a Star Destroyer.

01:28:22.736 --> 01:28:24.534
A ship from
the new Sith fleet.

01:28:24.536 --> 01:28:26.104
Out of the Unknowns.

01:28:26.106 --> 01:28:28.640
The Emperor sent a ship
from Exegol.

01:28:28.642 --> 01:28:30.241
Does that mean every ship
in the fleet...

01:28:30.243 --> 01:28:32.879
Has planet-killing weapons.
Of course they do.

01:28:33.512 --> 01:28:35.246
All of them.

01:28:35.248 --> 01:28:37.048
This is how he finishes it.

01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:38.482
Listen.

01:28:38.484 --> 01:28:40.385
It's on every frequency.

01:28:42.088 --> 01:28:44.322
"The Resistance is dead.

01:28:44.324 --> 01:28:46.159
"The Sith flame will burn.

01:28:47.193 --> 01:28:50.361
"All worlds,
surrender or die.

01:28:50.363 --> 01:28:53.264
"The Final Order begins."

01:28:53.266 --> 01:28:54.834
Leia made you acting general.

01:28:56.169 --> 01:28:57.671
What now?

01:29:06.179 --> 01:29:08.447
I gotta tell you,
I don't really know...

01:29:09.316 --> 01:29:10.850
how to do this.

01:29:12.319 --> 01:29:13.987
What you did...

01:29:15.956 --> 01:29:17.556
I'm not ready.

01:29:18.792 --> 01:29:20.492
Neither were we.

01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:25.932
Luke, Han, Leia, me...

01:29:26.666 --> 01:29:28.001
Who's ever ready?

01:29:28.567 --> 01:29:29.869
How'd you do it?

01:29:31.570 --> 01:29:35.073
Defeat an empire
with almost nothing.

01:29:35.075 --> 01:29:36.643
We had each other.

01:29:37.644 --> 01:29:39.545
That's how we won.

01:29:42.816 --> 01:29:44.682
Hey, don't touch that.
That's my friend's.

01:29:44.684 --> 01:29:46.820
Sorry.
She is gone?

01:29:47.586 --> 01:29:48.820
Yeah, she's gone.

01:29:48.822 --> 01:29:50.090
I don't know where.

01:29:51.157 --> 01:29:52.522
I miss her.

01:29:52.524 --> 01:29:53.793
I miss her, too.

01:29:56.595 --> 01:29:58.162
So, what's your name?

01:29:58.164 --> 01:29:59.664
I gotta talk to you
about something.

01:29:59.666 --> 01:30:00.832
I gotta talk to you
about something.

01:30:00.834 --> 01:30:02.433
I can't do this alone.

01:30:02.435 --> 01:30:03.935
I need you in command
with me.

01:30:03.937 --> 01:30:05.970
This droid has...
Thank you. I appreciate that.

01:30:05.972 --> 01:30:07.338
- General.
- General.

01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:09.307
This droid has a ton
of information about Exegol.

01:30:09.309 --> 01:30:11.075
- Wait, what? Cone-face?
- I am D-O.

01:30:11.077 --> 01:30:12.176
Sorry, D-O.

01:30:12.178 --> 01:30:14.645
He was going to Exegol
with Ochi of Bestoon.

01:30:14.647 --> 01:30:16.147
Why was Ochi going there?

01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:17.482
To bring the little girl

01:30:17.484 --> 01:30:20.084
he was supposed to take
from Jakku to the Emperor.

01:30:20.086 --> 01:30:22.120
He wanted her alive.

01:31:12.038 --> 01:31:15.775
A Jedi's weapon
deserves more respect.

01:31:17.744 --> 01:31:20.178
Master Skywalker.

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:22.980
What are you doing?

01:31:22.982 --> 01:31:25.716
I saw myself
on the dark throne.

01:31:25.718 --> 01:31:27.318
I won't let it happen.

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.023
I'm never leaving this place.
I'm doing what you did.

01:31:30.723 --> 01:31:32.692
I was wrong.

01:31:33.793 --> 01:31:36.229
It was fear
that kept me here.

01:31:37.730 --> 01:31:39.632
What are you most afraid of?

01:31:44.137 --> 01:31:45.138
Myself.

01:31:48.074 --> 01:31:50.076
Because you're a Palpatine.

01:31:52.412 --> 01:31:54.180
Leia knew it, too.

01:31:55.315 --> 01:31:56.783
She didn't tell me.

01:32:03.957 --> 01:32:06.624
She still trained me.

01:32:06.626 --> 01:32:09.494
Because she saw
your spirit.

01:32:09.496 --> 01:32:11.131
Your heart.

01:32:14.033 --> 01:32:15.068
Rey.

01:32:16.202 --> 01:32:19.670
Some things are stronger
than blood.

01:32:19.672 --> 01:32:23.307
Confronting fear
is the destiny of a Jedi.

01:32:23.309 --> 01:32:25.009
Your destiny.

01:32:25.011 --> 01:32:27.145
If you don't face
Palpatine...

01:32:27.147 --> 01:32:29.382
it will mean the end
of the Jedi.

01:32:30.817 --> 01:32:32.852
And the war will be lost.

01:32:36.322 --> 01:32:39.292
There's something my sister
would want you to have.

01:32:54.741 --> 01:32:56.342
Leia's saber.

01:32:58.244 --> 01:33:00.680
It was the last night
of her training.

01:33:17.764 --> 01:33:20.898
<i>Leia told me that she had
sensed the death of her son</i>

01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:24.569
<i>at the end of her Jedi path.</i>

01:33:24.571 --> 01:33:28.573
<i>She surrendered her saber
to me and said that one day...</i>

01:33:28.575 --> 01:33:30.741
it would be picked up
again...

01:33:30.743 --> 01:33:33.846
by someone who would
finish her journey.

01:33:35.715 --> 01:33:39.185
A thousand generations
live in you now.

01:33:40.053 --> 01:33:43.154
But this is your fight.

01:33:43.156 --> 01:33:46.059
You'll take both sabers
to Exegol.

01:33:48.361 --> 01:33:49.760
I can't get there.

01:33:49.762 --> 01:33:52.698
I don't have the wayfinder.
I destroyed Ren's ship.

01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:55.235
You have everything you need.

01:34:05.378 --> 01:34:06.777
Two were made.

01:35:03.136 --> 01:35:08.139
Oh, hello. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

01:35:08.141 --> 01:35:10.508
And you are?

01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:13.044
What?

01:35:13.046 --> 01:35:15.246
Well, I am quite certain
I would remember

01:35:15.248 --> 01:35:16.782
if I had a best friend.

01:35:18.217 --> 01:35:20.084
You want to put what
in my head?

01:35:20.086 --> 01:35:21.521
Under no circumstances...

01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:27.626
Memory restoration complete.

01:35:27.628 --> 01:35:29.293
Artoo, have you heard?

01:35:29.295 --> 01:35:32.096
I am going with Mistress Rey
on her very first mission.

01:35:33.399 --> 01:35:36.067
I already have?

01:35:36.069 --> 01:35:38.271
Picking up a signal?
From whom?

01:35:44.143 --> 01:35:46.678
All the information you need
for an airstrike on Exegol.

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:47.945
Yeah, except
how to get there.

01:35:47.947 --> 01:35:48.979
Are you seeing
these atmo readings?

01:35:48.981 --> 01:35:50.047
It's a mess out there.

01:35:50.049 --> 01:35:51.215
Magnetic crossfields.

01:35:51.217 --> 01:35:52.950
Gravity wells,
solar winds.

01:35:52.952 --> 01:35:54.185
How does a fleet
even take off from there?

01:35:54.187 --> 01:35:55.386
Terribly sorry.

01:35:55.388 --> 01:35:56.854
I'm afraid
Artoo's memory bank

01:35:56.856 --> 01:35:59.390
must be crossed
with his logic receptors.

01:35:59.392 --> 01:36:02.560
He says he is receiving
a transmission from

01:36:02.562 --> 01:36:03.896
Master Luke.

01:36:04.597 --> 01:36:06.199
That's an old craft ID.

01:36:07.066 --> 01:36:09.033
That's Luke Skywalker's
X-wing.

01:36:09.035 --> 01:36:11.135
It's transmitting
course marker signals

01:36:11.137 --> 01:36:13.037
on its way
to the Unknown Regions.

01:36:13.039 --> 01:36:14.372
It's Rey.

01:36:18.911 --> 01:36:20.513
<i>She's going to Exegol.</i>

01:36:25.151 --> 01:36:26.584
She's showing us.

01:36:26.586 --> 01:36:28.454
She's showing us
how to get there.

01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:32.657
Then we go together.

01:36:37.964 --> 01:36:40.632
Come on, buddy,
we need you.

01:36:40.634 --> 01:36:43.467
<i>As long as those
Star Destroyers are on Exegol</i>

01:36:43.469 --> 01:36:44.568
we can hit them.

01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:45.604
Hit them how?

01:36:45.606 --> 01:36:46.937
They can't activate
their shields

01:36:46.939 --> 01:36:48.339
until they leave atmosphere.

01:36:48.341 --> 01:36:49.674
Which isn't easy on Exegol.

01:36:49.676 --> 01:36:51.643
Ships that size
need help taking off.

01:36:51.645 --> 01:36:53.477
Nav can't tell
which way's up out there.

01:36:53.479 --> 01:36:55.012
So, how do the ships
take off?

01:36:55.014 --> 01:36:56.815
They use a signal
from a navigation tower,

01:36:56.817 --> 01:36:58.418
like this one.

01:36:59.118 --> 01:37:00.351
Except they won't.

01:37:00.353 --> 01:37:01.820
Air team's gonna
find the tower,

01:37:01.822 --> 01:37:03.254
ground team's
gonna blast it.

01:37:03.256 --> 01:37:05.022
- Ground team?
- I have an idea for that.

01:37:05.024 --> 01:37:07.024
Once the tower's down,
the fleet will be stuck in atmo...

01:37:07.026 --> 01:37:08.125
for just minutes,

01:37:08.127 --> 01:37:09.960
with no shields,
and no way out.

01:37:09.962 --> 01:37:11.195
We think hitting the cannons

01:37:11.197 --> 01:37:13.164
might ignite
the main reactors.

01:37:13.166 --> 01:37:14.666
That's our chance.

01:37:14.668 --> 01:37:16.534
We need to pull
some Holdo maneuvers.

01:37:16.536 --> 01:37:17.903
Do some real damage.

01:37:17.905 --> 01:37:19.638
Come on.
That move is one in a million.

01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:21.038
Fighters and freighters
can take out their cannons

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.462
if there are enough of us.

01:37:22.464 --> 01:37:24.040
There aren't enough of us!

01:37:24.042 --> 01:37:26.143
He's right. We'd be
no more than bugs to them.

01:37:26.145 --> 01:37:28.212
That's where Lando
and Chewie come in.

01:37:28.214 --> 01:37:30.514
They'll take the <i>Falcon</i>
to the Core Systems.

01:37:30.516 --> 01:37:32.983
Send out a call for help
for anybody listening.

01:37:32.985 --> 01:37:34.318
We've got friends
out there.

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.953
They'll come if they
know there's hope.

01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:39.557
They will.

01:37:39.559 --> 01:37:42.495
First Order wins by making
us think we're alone.

01:37:43.129 --> 01:37:45.095
We're not alone.

01:37:45.097 --> 01:37:47.668
Good people will fight
if we lead them.

01:37:50.771 --> 01:37:53.204
<i>Leia never gave up.</i>

01:37:53.206 --> 01:37:55.707
<i>And neither will we.</i>

01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:58.110
<i>We're gonna show them
we're not afraid.</i>

01:38:02.448 --> 01:38:05.115
<i>What our mothers
and fathers fought for...</i>

01:38:05.117 --> 01:38:07.153
<i>we will not let die.</i>

01:38:09.623 --> 01:38:10.757
<i>Not today.</i>

01:38:12.124 --> 01:38:14.761
<i>Today, we make
our last stand.</i>

01:38:15.561 --> 01:38:17.196
<i>For the galaxy.</i>

01:38:19.031 --> 01:38:20.399
<i>For Leia.</i>

01:38:23.102 --> 01:38:24.771
For everyone we've lost.

01:38:26.005 --> 01:38:27.774
They've taken enough of us.

01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:30.777
Now we take the war to them.

01:38:57.403 --> 01:38:58.937
<i>She's on approach.</i>

01:38:58.939 --> 01:39:01.773
<i>All ships rise
to deployment altitude.</i>

01:39:41.715 --> 01:39:43.514
I know
it's a rough ride...

01:39:43.516 --> 01:39:45.082
but stay locked
on Rey's course.

01:39:51.758 --> 01:39:53.625
<i>Clear run frequency.</i>

01:39:53.627 --> 01:39:55.994
<i>Captain, we have
Resistance craft incoming.</i>

01:39:55.996 --> 01:39:57.161
Allegiant General...

01:39:57.163 --> 01:39:58.531
<i>Use ion cannons!</i>

01:40:03.937 --> 01:40:05.338
Look at that fleet.

01:40:08.609 --> 01:40:09.610
Damn it!

01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:12.646
Welcome to Exegol.

01:40:16.148 --> 01:40:18.449
Watch your starboard, Wexley!

01:40:18.451 --> 01:40:20.685
- Whoa!
- Get to their altitude.

01:40:20.687 --> 01:40:22.789
They can't fire on us
without hitting each other.

01:40:23.857 --> 01:40:25.289
Don't give up.

01:40:25.291 --> 01:40:26.827
Help is coming.

01:40:28.127 --> 01:40:29.326
There it is.

01:40:29.328 --> 01:40:31.128
Poe, I see it.

01:40:31.130 --> 01:40:32.431
I've got a visual
on the tower.

01:41:21.313 --> 01:41:23.148
- Incoming TIEs!
- I see 'em!

01:41:23.150 --> 01:41:24.350
I got you, Finn.

01:41:28.587 --> 01:41:30.589
- You ready back there?
- Never been readier.

01:41:32.926 --> 01:41:34.993
They're targeting
the navigation tower...

01:41:34.995 --> 01:41:36.226
so the fleet can't deploy.

01:41:36.228 --> 01:41:37.629
Then we won't use
that tower.

01:41:37.631 --> 01:41:39.396
Switch over the source
of navigation signal

01:41:39.398 --> 01:41:40.665
to this ship.

01:41:40.667 --> 01:41:42.602
We'll guide
the fleet out ourselves.

01:41:48.507 --> 01:41:50.809
The navigation tower
has been deactivated.

01:41:50.811 --> 01:41:52.744
- What?
- Those ships need that signal.

01:41:52.746 --> 01:41:54.411
It's gotta be coming
from somewhere.

01:41:54.413 --> 01:41:56.181
<i>They figured out
what we're doing.</i>

01:41:56.183 --> 01:41:58.149
<i>Call off the ground invasion.</i>

01:41:58.151 --> 01:42:00.451
Wait.

01:42:00.453 --> 01:42:02.787
The nav signal's coming
from that command ship.

01:42:02.789 --> 01:42:04.421
That's our drop zone.

01:42:04.423 --> 01:42:05.759
How do you know?

01:42:06.693 --> 01:42:07.625
A feeling.

01:42:07.627 --> 01:42:09.426
You wanna launch
a ground invasion

01:42:09.428 --> 01:42:10.762
on a Star Destroyer?

01:42:10.764 --> 01:42:12.262
I don't want to,
but we can't take out

01:42:12.264 --> 01:42:13.464
that ship's nav system
from the air.

01:42:13.466 --> 01:42:14.899
Give us cover.

01:42:14.901 --> 01:42:16.300
We gotta keep that fleet
there till help arrives.

01:42:16.302 --> 01:42:17.704
- We hope.
- We hope.

01:42:18.972 --> 01:42:20.304
You heard the General.

01:42:20.306 --> 01:42:22.909
All Wings,
cover that lander.

01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:29.748
They've landed
a troop carrier.

01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:31.783
- Jam the speeders.
- I can't, sir.

01:42:31.785 --> 01:42:32.786
Why not?

01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:34.955
They're not using speeders.

01:42:40.761 --> 01:42:42.361
Not bad
for one lesson.

01:42:43.196 --> 01:42:44.798
You had a good teacher!

01:42:52.239 --> 01:42:53.439
Keep going!

01:42:58.979 --> 01:43:00.477
You're doing great, buddy!

01:43:00.479 --> 01:43:02.281
The tower's up ahead.

01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:09.749
Long have I waited.

01:44:19.626 --> 01:44:23.763
For my grandchild
to come home.

01:44:26.032 --> 01:44:28.666
I never wanted you dead.

01:44:28.668 --> 01:44:31.468
I wanted you here...

01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:33.807
Empress Palpatine.

01:44:36.243 --> 01:44:38.144
You will take the throne.

01:44:40.814 --> 01:44:45.415
It is your birthright
to rule here.

01:44:45.417 --> 01:44:49.187
It is in your blood.
Our blood.

01:44:50.824 --> 01:44:53.725
I haven't come
to lead the Sith...

01:44:53.727 --> 01:44:55.492
I have come
to end them.

01:44:55.494 --> 01:44:57.561
As a Jedi?

01:44:57.563 --> 01:45:00.198
- Yes.
- No.

01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:04.269
Your hatred, your anger.

01:45:04.271 --> 01:45:06.740
You want to kill me.

01:45:08.041 --> 01:45:10.043
That is what I want.

01:45:11.443 --> 01:45:13.011
Kill me...

01:45:13.013 --> 01:45:16.681
and my spirit
will pass into you.

01:45:16.683 --> 01:45:20.517
As all the Sith
live in me...

01:45:20.519 --> 01:45:23.487
you will be Empress...

01:45:23.489 --> 01:45:25.725
we will be one.

01:45:33.099 --> 01:45:35.166
Those thrusters are hot.
How are we doing?

01:45:35.168 --> 01:45:37.735
We're gonna blow our way in,
and take out that nav tower.

01:45:37.737 --> 01:45:39.270
All the hatches
are blast-proof!

01:45:39.272 --> 01:45:40.705
All right, BB-8,
you're up!

01:45:40.707 --> 01:45:42.142
I'll cover you.

01:46:09.936 --> 01:46:12.070
This should do it.

01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:25.185
There it goes.

01:46:26.552 --> 01:46:27.986
Nice one, Finn.

01:46:27.988 --> 01:46:30.188
Nav signal's down,
but not for long.

01:46:30.190 --> 01:46:31.624
We're offline, sir.

01:46:32.591 --> 01:46:34.158
Reset the navigation signal!

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.195
Minutes away, sir.

01:46:36.863 --> 01:46:39.030
- Finn, let's go!
- No, no, wait, listen.

01:46:39.032 --> 01:46:40.331
The crown cannons
have stopped.

01:46:40.333 --> 01:46:41.466
They're resetting
their systems.

01:46:41.468 --> 01:46:44.170
- So?
- I gotta go do something.

01:46:44.804 --> 01:46:46.572
I'm staying with you.

01:46:48.574 --> 01:46:50.174
Still no <i>Falcon</i> or backup.

01:46:51.478 --> 01:46:54.779
I don't know, Artoo.
Maybe nobody else is coming.

01:46:54.781 --> 01:46:55.982
What do we do, General?

01:46:57.017 --> 01:46:58.816
We gotta hit them ourselves.

01:46:58.818 --> 01:46:59.951
What can we do
against these things?

01:46:59.953 --> 01:47:01.921
<i>Just stay alive!</i>

01:47:04.157 --> 01:47:06.525
The time has come!

01:47:16.069 --> 01:47:19.804
With your hatred,
you will take my life.

01:47:19.806 --> 01:47:21.908
And you will ascend.

01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:26.813
All you want is for me
to hate, but I won't.

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.948
Not even you.

01:47:29.849 --> 01:47:33.153
Weak.
Like your parents.

01:47:34.421 --> 01:47:36.156
My parents were strong.

01:47:36.956 --> 01:47:39.157
They saved me from you.

01:47:39.159 --> 01:47:43.761
Your Master, Luke Skywalker,
was saved by his father.

01:47:43.763 --> 01:47:47.333
The only family
you have here...

01:47:47.967 --> 01:47:49.202
is me.

01:48:10.323 --> 01:48:13.724
They don't have long.

01:48:13.726 --> 01:48:17.261
<i>No one is coming
to help them.</i>

01:48:17.263 --> 01:48:21.234
<i>And you are the one
who led them here.</i>

01:48:22.368 --> 01:48:26.037
<i>Strike me down.
Take the throne.</i>

01:48:26.039 --> 01:48:28.406
<i>Reign over the new Empire...</i>

01:48:28.408 --> 01:48:31.277
<i>and the fleet will be yours.</i>

01:48:32.879 --> 01:48:36.950
<i>Only you have the power
to save them.</i>

01:48:38.985 --> 01:48:43.756
<i>Refuse,
and your new family...</i>

01:48:44.591 --> 01:48:46.626
dies.

01:49:04.544 --> 01:49:06.179
Good.

01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:18.858
Ow.

01:49:21.761 --> 01:49:25.129
Finn, where are you?
The lander's leaving.

01:49:25.131 --> 01:49:27.765
- <i>Finn!</i>
- Go without us.

01:49:27.767 --> 01:49:29.702
We're taking
this entire ship down.

01:49:31.371 --> 01:49:32.870
What? How?

01:49:32.872 --> 01:49:34.340
<i>We're gonna hit
the command deck.</i>

01:49:35.275 --> 01:49:38.044
Rose, please. Go.

01:49:39.613 --> 01:49:41.712
- Rose!
- Rose!

01:49:41.714 --> 01:49:43.349
I'll get the trigger!

01:49:45.818 --> 01:49:48.386
The ritual begins.

01:49:49.722 --> 01:49:51.956
She will strike me down...

01:49:51.958 --> 01:49:55.426
and pledge herself
as a Sith.

01:50:15.782 --> 01:50:18.282
<i>She will draw her weapon.</i>

01:50:20.954 --> 01:50:23.487
She will come to me.

01:50:36.903 --> 01:50:39.237
She will take her revenge.

01:50:45.646 --> 01:50:48.579
And with a stroke
of her saber...

01:50:48.581 --> 01:50:51.449
the Sith are reborn!

01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:55.388
The Jedi are dead!

01:51:16.677 --> 01:51:17.842
Do it!

01:51:17.844 --> 01:51:20.213
Make the sacrifice!

01:52:29.717 --> 01:52:33.551
Stand together,
die together.

01:52:42.763 --> 01:52:45.898
The lifeforce of your bond...

01:52:48.134 --> 01:52:51.770
a dyad in the Force.

01:52:51.772 --> 01:52:55.074
A power like life itself.

01:52:55.843 --> 01:52:59.577
Unseen for generations.

01:52:59.579 --> 01:53:01.445
And now...

01:53:01.447 --> 01:53:07.987
the power of two restores
the one, true Emperor.

01:53:29.275 --> 01:53:30.541
<i>Snap,
they're on your tail.</i>

01:53:30.543 --> 01:53:31.610
Yeah, I see 'em!

01:53:31.612 --> 01:53:33.645
No, no, no, Snap, Snap!

01:53:33.647 --> 01:53:35.148
No!

01:53:37.383 --> 01:53:39.818
<i>Alpha Three is down.</i>

01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:42.353
<i>They're on my tail!
I can't get...</i>

01:53:42.355 --> 01:53:44.157
<i>They're everywhere!</i>

01:53:45.591 --> 01:53:47.460
<i>Delta leader's hit!</i>

01:53:48.194 --> 01:53:49.593
<i>Losing altitude!</i>

01:53:49.595 --> 01:53:51.395
<i>General,
what's our next move?</i>

01:53:51.397 --> 01:53:53.597
<i>Poe, what now?</i>

01:53:53.599 --> 01:53:55.001
My friends...

01:53:57.403 --> 01:53:58.571
I'm sorry.

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:01.441
I thought we had a shot.

01:54:03.142 --> 01:54:06.110
But there's just
too many of them.

01:54:06.112 --> 01:54:08.747
<i>But there are
more of us, Poe.</i>

01:54:08.749 --> 01:54:10.583
<i>There are more of us.</i>

01:54:21.628 --> 01:54:23.662
Look at this.

01:54:23.664 --> 01:54:25.298
Look at this.

01:54:34.006 --> 01:54:37.009
Lando, you did it.
You did it!

01:54:39.178 --> 01:54:40.578
Hit those underbelly cannons.

01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:43.182
Every one we knock out
is a world saved.

01:54:46.118 --> 01:54:47.487
Nice flying, Lando.

01:54:57.664 --> 01:54:59.497
We have a ship down.
We lost a Destroyer.

01:54:59.499 --> 01:55:01.098
Systems not responding.

01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:02.233
Where did they get
all these fighter craft?

01:55:02.235 --> 01:55:03.467
They have no navy.

01:55:03.469 --> 01:55:06.506
It's not a navy, sir,
it's just people.

01:55:17.316 --> 01:55:19.283
<i>So long, sky trash!</i>

01:55:19.285 --> 01:55:20.551
Who's that flyer?

01:55:20.553 --> 01:55:22.954
<i>Take a guess,
spice runner.</i>

01:55:24.825 --> 01:55:27.694
Ha! Zorii! You made it!

01:55:40.306 --> 01:55:43.742
Look what you have made.

01:56:02.663 --> 01:56:05.931
As once I fell...

01:56:05.933 --> 01:56:10.100
so falls
the last Skywalker.

01:56:17.376 --> 01:56:21.012
Do not fear
that feeble attack...

01:56:21.014 --> 01:56:23.314
my faithful.

01:56:23.316 --> 01:56:27.286
Nothing will stop
the return of the Sith!

01:56:38.999 --> 01:56:40.899
Artoo, my systems
are failing.

01:56:41.969 --> 01:56:43.302
Does anyone copy?

01:57:24.711 --> 01:57:26.379
Be with me.

01:57:31.051 --> 01:57:32.853
Be with me.

01:57:38.357 --> 01:57:40.359
Be with me.

01:57:43.630 --> 01:57:46.898
<i>These are
your final steps, Rey.</i>

01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:49.768
<i>Rise and take them.</i>

01:57:49.770 --> 01:57:51.736
- <i>Rey.</i>
- <i>Rey.</i>

01:57:51.738 --> 01:57:53.138
<i>Rey.</i>

01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:54.873
<i>Bring back
the balance, Rey, as I did.</i>

01:57:54.875 --> 01:57:57.474
<i>In the night,
find the light, Rey.</i>

01:57:57.476 --> 01:57:59.243
<i>You're not alone, Rey.</i>

01:57:59.245 --> 01:58:01.245
<i>Alone never have you been.</i>

01:58:01.247 --> 01:58:04.581
<i>Every Jedi
who ever lived lives in you.</i>

01:58:04.583 --> 01:58:05.850
<i>The Force surrounds you, Rey.</i>

01:58:05.852 --> 01:58:07.251
<i>Let it guide you.</i>

01:58:07.253 --> 01:58:08.787
<i>As it guided us.</i>

01:58:08.789 --> 01:58:10.487
<i>Feel the Force
flowing through you, Rey.</i>

01:58:10.489 --> 01:58:11.856
<i>Let it lift you.</i>

01:58:11.858 --> 01:58:13.590
<i>Rise, Rey.</i>

01:58:13.592 --> 01:58:15.292
<i>We stand behind you, Rey.</i>

01:58:15.294 --> 01:58:16.593
<i>Rey.</i>

01:58:16.595 --> 01:58:18.663
<i>Rise in the Force.</i>

01:58:18.665 --> 01:58:22.600
<i>In the heart of a Jedi
lies her strength.</i>

01:58:22.602 --> 01:58:24.969
- <i>Rise.</i>
- <i>Rise.</i>

01:58:24.971 --> 01:58:30.443
<i>Rey, the Force
will be with you, always.</i>

01:58:48.628 --> 01:58:52.097
Let your death
be the final word...

01:58:52.099 --> 01:58:54.935
in the story of rebellion.

01:59:05.879 --> 01:59:08.179
I'm back on!
This is our last chance.

01:59:08.181 --> 01:59:10.316
We gotta hit
those cannons now!

01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:17.321
You are nothing!

01:59:17.323 --> 01:59:21.661
A scavenger girl is no
match for the power in me.

01:59:24.965 --> 01:59:28.666
I am all the Sith!

01:59:31.337 --> 01:59:33.305
And I...

01:59:38.444 --> 01:59:40.344
I'm all the Jedi.

02:00:30.730 --> 02:00:32.531
Poe, the command ship!

02:00:33.834 --> 02:00:35.566
<i>Their fleet is stuck here!</i>

02:00:35.568 --> 02:00:36.937
They're toast!
Come on!

02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:42.339
Finn, you seeing this?

02:00:42.341 --> 02:00:44.008
Finn didn't board
the lander.

02:00:44.010 --> 02:00:46.343
They're still
on that command ship?

02:00:56.623 --> 02:00:59.657
I see them.
I'm going to get them.

02:00:59.659 --> 02:01:01.226
General,
you won't make it.

02:01:01.228 --> 02:01:02.593
Trust me, I'm fast!

02:01:02.595 --> 02:01:04.631
<i>Not as fast
as this ship.</i>

02:01:07.167 --> 02:01:09.669
Hold on, Chewie!

02:01:19.179 --> 02:01:20.912
Finn!

02:01:56.049 --> 02:01:58.151
No, Rey.

02:04:21.194 --> 02:04:22.729
Ben.

02:05:44.744 --> 02:05:46.346
<i>There, look!</i>

02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:48.614
Red Five is in the air.

02:05:48.616 --> 02:05:50.049
Rey's alive.

02:05:51.684 --> 02:05:53.284
I see her.

02:05:53.286 --> 02:05:56.087
<i>People are rising up
all over the galaxy.</i>

02:05:56.089 --> 02:05:59.357
<i>Poe. We did it.</i>

02:05:59.359 --> 02:06:00.393
We did it.

02:06:56.916 --> 02:06:58.851
Happy.

02:07:02.789 --> 02:07:04.090
Chewie!

02:07:34.722 --> 02:07:35.886
Hi!

02:07:35.888 --> 02:07:37.156
Good job!

02:07:41.861 --> 02:07:43.229
Chewie.

02:07:45.699 --> 02:07:47.800
This is for you.

02:08:06.185 --> 02:08:07.887
Did you hear that?

02:08:34.213 --> 02:08:36.113
Where are you from,
General?

02:08:36.115 --> 02:08:38.151
The Gold system.

02:08:42.723 --> 02:08:44.157
Well, what about you, kid?

02:08:44.792 --> 02:08:46.424
Oh.

02:08:46.426 --> 02:08:47.827
I don't know.

02:08:49.797 --> 02:08:51.531
Well, let's find out.

02:11:31.491 --> 02:11:34.126
There's been no one
for so long.

02:11:34.828 --> 02:11:36.429
Who are you?

02:11:37.931 --> 02:11:39.465
I'm Rey.

02:11:40.634 --> 02:11:41.735
Rey who?

02:12:06.592 --> 02:12:08.094
Rey Skywalker.
