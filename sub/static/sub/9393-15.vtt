00:36.316 --> 00:38.417
We now return
to <i>Jeopardy Presents:</i>

00:38.451 --> 00:40.619
"The Best of Contestant Banter."

00:40.654 --> 00:43.522
So, Ben, it says here
you have a connection to milk.

00:43.556 --> 00:45.291
Yes, funny story.
I discovered recently

00:45.325 --> 00:47.026
that I have an allergy to milk.

00:47.060 --> 00:50.829
So I guess we won't
be eating any cheese around you.

00:50.864 --> 00:54.066
And Dennis, you once spent
a night in a tent?

00:54.100 --> 00:56.468
So, uh, what do you guys got
planned for the weekend?

00:56.503 --> 00:58.771
I don't know. I might sit
out in the front yard

00:58.805 --> 01:00.372
with a rake and
wave at cars.

01:00.407 --> 01:02.341
Yeah, and I found a hole
in my fence

01:02.375 --> 01:03.876
I was gonna maybe
stick stuff through.

01:03.910 --> 01:04.943
God, look at us.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.712
How'd we become so dull
and pathetic?

01:06.746 --> 01:07.713
You're right.

01:07.747 --> 01:09.214
I mean, we used
to have hobbies.

01:09.249 --> 01:10.749
Remember when I was
a horse whisperer?

01:14.454 --> 01:15.654
Shh, shh, shh.

01:18.958 --> 01:22.094
That's right.
I bet you're hungry.

01:22.128 --> 01:23.529
It's okay.

01:25.398 --> 01:27.933
That calmed you down,
you  horse.

01:27.967 --> 01:29.468
Maybe it's time
the three of us

01:29.502 --> 01:30.936
do something exciting
to shake things up.

01:30.970 --> 01:32.538
Hey, now that's
a good idea, Joe!

01:32.572 --> 01:34.106
All right, okay,
I have two ideas.

01:34.140 --> 01:35.374
One that I think is awesome,

01:35.408 --> 01:36.775
and one that I think
is stupid.

01:36.810 --> 01:38.577
See if you can guess
which one is which.

01:38.611 --> 01:43.082
We could either
A) Rob a Mafia poker game,

01:43.116 --> 01:44.850
or B) Skydive.

01:44.884 --> 01:47.252
Skydiving, huh?
I'd be totally up for that!

01:47.287 --> 01:49.088
Yeah, I've always wanted
to try skydiving!

01:49.122 --> 01:51.690
Really? Eh, could be fun,
I guess.

01:51.725 --> 01:52.925
Besides, I haven't done
anything new

01:52.959 --> 01:54.927
since I learned
to use a palm frond.

01:54.961 --> 01:57.329
So do I try
to match your speed?

01:57.364 --> 01:58.931
Yeah, just match my speed.

01:58.965 --> 02:00.599
And do we stagger
our waves

02:00.633 --> 02:02.134
or do 'em
at the same time?

02:02.168 --> 02:03.869
Um, they should've covered this
in orientation.

02:03.903 --> 02:06.338
Guards, have
the new guy executed!

02:06.373 --> 02:07.773
Am I the new guy?

02:11.244 --> 02:13.278
All right, we're almost at
our jumping altitude .

02:13.313 --> 02:14.713
Does anyone have
any questions?

02:14.748 --> 02:17.216
Yeah, I got one. Can I listen
to my iPod on the way down?

02:17.250 --> 02:18.717
Of course. Just as long

02:18.752 --> 02:20.619
as it's not
Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".

02:20.653 --> 02:22.287
I'll just keep
it in my pocket.

02:22.322 --> 02:23.322
Any other questions?

02:23.356 --> 02:24.556
Let's do this!

02:24.591 --> 02:28.127
That wasn't a question.
Back of the line.

02:28.161 --> 02:29.628
Okay, let's do this!

02:29.662 --> 02:31.597
Hey!

02:31.631 --> 02:33.031
Whoa, is that
Harrison Ford?

02:33.066 --> 02:34.533
Yeah. It said in
the brochure

02:34.567 --> 02:36.402
that he assists
with all the jumps.

02:36.436 --> 02:40.305
Get off my plane!
Get off my plane!

02:40.340 --> 02:42.441
Get off my plane!

02:42.475 --> 02:44.877
Oh, look, he even brought
Calista Flockhart with him.

02:44.911 --> 02:47.346
Uh, Peter, I think that's
just a piece of paper.

02:47.380 --> 02:48.947
Good, 'cause
she looked fat.

02:48.982 --> 02:51.116
Get off my plane!

02:51.151 --> 02:53.519
Get off my plane!
Get off my plane!

02:53.553 --> 02:55.154
All right!

02:55.188 --> 02:57.356
Yeah! This is amazing!

02:57.390 --> 02:58.824
I know,
it's unbelievable!

02:58.858 --> 03:01.126
Hey, guys, let's try
to re-create this feeling

03:01.161 --> 03:03.028
for the rest of our lives,
with drugs.

03:06.466 --> 03:08.033
Oh, it looks like
it's almost time

03:08.067 --> 03:10.068
for us to pull our cords.

03:10.103 --> 03:11.703
Wait, wait, guys.
How about this?

03:11.738 --> 03:14.072
Last one to open their chute
gets 20 bucks.

03:14.107 --> 03:15.808
Okay.
I'm in.

03:18.445 --> 03:19.978
Damn it!

03:21.848 --> 03:24.349
I'm dead already, Peter.

03:24.384 --> 03:26.018
You're looking
at a dead man.

03:26.052 --> 03:28.987
I might not even pull
the cord at all.

03:33.927 --> 03:35.694
Holy crap, this is awesome!

03:35.728 --> 03:38.664
I haven't felt a rush like this
since I won that marathon!

03:44.037 --> 03:45.337
I'm Bob Costas,

03:45.371 --> 03:46.772
here with Boston Marathon
winner Peter Griffin.

03:46.806 --> 03:48.106
Peter, how did you do it?

03:48.141 --> 03:49.308
I'll tell ya, Bob.

03:49.342 --> 03:51.210
I just got in my car
and drove it.

03:51.244 --> 03:53.745
And when there was a guy
in my way, I killed him.

03:57.116 --> 03:59.284
Kids, have you seen
your father?

04:00.320 --> 04:01.453
Hello?

04:01.488 --> 04:03.489
Is dinner almost ready?!

04:03.523 --> 04:04.890
Yes, Peter.
God, where are you?

04:04.924 --> 04:06.225
I can barely hear you.

04:06.259 --> 04:08.393
Pull back my chair
ever so slightly.

04:10.864 --> 04:12.931
Daddy's home.

04:15.134 --> 04:18.837
All right, it's 4:59.
In just a few seconds,

04:18.872 --> 04:22.007
all the unreturned library books
will be officially late.

04:23.443 --> 04:26.845
The wieners was already drawed
in the books when I got 'em.

Stop smiling.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.643
90% of the people
playing this are pooping.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.081
Hey, Lois, when are you
gonna do the laundry?

05:03.116 --> 05:04.683
I got, like, six
parachutes in there.

05:04.717 --> 05:06.878
Peter, those things are choking
up the washing machine.

05:06.886 --> 05:08.387
Oh, so now I got you
a bad washing machine

05:08.421 --> 05:09.855
for Christmas.

05:09.889 --> 05:10.923
Little tip, Stewie:

05:10.957 --> 05:12.891
Love dies, and
that's okay.

05:12.926 --> 05:15.627
I write down all his advice
in a little notebook.

05:15.662 --> 05:17.829
Yesterday's was, "I've
never seen a pigeon die

05:17.864 --> 05:19.064
"from eating food
on the ground,

05:19.098 --> 05:20.899
so what's the big whoop?"

05:20.934 --> 05:23.068
Peter, this skydiving thing
has gotta stop.

05:23.102 --> 05:24.570
You've destroyed half
the neighborhood.

05:24.604 --> 05:26.939
And I'm afraid you're
gonna really hurt yourself.

05:26.973 --> 05:27.973
I'm sorry, Lois.

05:28.007 --> 05:29.675
But skydiving is
who I am now.

05:29.709 --> 05:31.543
It's like they say,
fish gotta swim,

05:31.578 --> 05:34.313
birds gotta fly,
and gay guys gotta criticize

05:34.347 --> 05:36.114
the host of the party
behind his back.

05:36.149 --> 05:38.050
Oh, my God, look,
a bowl of M&M's.

05:38.084 --> 05:39.618
What are we, six?

05:39.652 --> 05:41.687
I know. And remind me
to get the recipe

05:41.721 --> 05:43.221
for those chopped-up
hot dogs.

05:44.591 --> 05:47.159
Oh, my God, Josh,
this party is so amazing!

05:47.193 --> 05:50.228
Everything is perfect!
We're having so much fun!

05:50.263 --> 05:53.198
Oh, thanks! I'm so glad
you guys could make it!

05:53.232 --> 05:54.933
Come on. He saw us.
Let's go.

05:57.971 --> 05:59.805
First time?

05:59.839 --> 06:01.106
Yeah. You?

06:01.140 --> 06:03.809
No.
No, not my first time.

06:04.811 --> 06:06.745
Thanks for the lift, Gil.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.347
You know, when I thought
I was gonna die,

07:21.382 --> 07:23.717
I saw my whole life flash
before my eyes,

07:23.751 --> 07:26.453
and we did way too much
<i>Star Wars</i> crap.

07:26.487 --> 07:29.222
I should get the kids home.
It's way past dinner.

I am Mahmoud.

I'm Peter. You know,
I never seen a hat

so I'm very scared of it.

07:53.114 --> 07:54.614
No, this is just
a taqiyah.

Look, I'm just saying

08:47.701 --> 08:49.669
if "pro" is the opposite
of "con",

08:49.703 --> 08:51.371
what is the opposite
of "progress"?

08:51.405 --> 08:52.438
Think about it.

08:52.473 --> 08:53.740
You know, I actually had

08:53.774 --> 08:55.241
a pretty good time in
the hospital.

08:55.276 --> 08:56.943
I even made a new friend.
You did?

08:56.977 --> 08:58.077
Yeah, his name's Mahmoud.

08:58.112 --> 09:00.747
In fact, I told him to swing by

09:00.781 --> 09:01.781

09:23.871 --> 09:25.305
Okay, well,
how about this, Mahmoud?

09:25.339 --> 09:27.173
You know "progress" has
the word "pro" in it, right?

09:27.208 --> 09:28.408
Shut up, Joe!

09:28.442 --> 09:30.710
Hey, you guys, come on.
Let's get the man a drink.

09:30.744 --> 09:31.811
What are you having?

09:31.846 --> 09:33.379
How about a ginger ale?

09:33.414 --> 09:36.249
But if you'll excuse me,
right now I have to go

09:36.283 --> 09:38.952
bring great shame to myself
by using the restroom.

09:38.986 --> 09:40.453
Isn't he great?

09:40.487 --> 09:41.454
No, he's weird.

09:41.488 --> 09:42.856
Why'd he order
a ginger ale?

09:42.890 --> 09:44.757
And who the hell doesn't
look at jugs?

09:44.792 --> 09:46.459
Yeah, and he's got
his cell phone clipped

09:46.493 --> 09:49.262
to his belt like he's some
kind of big shot on vacation.

09:49.296 --> 09:51.397
Oh, I see what's going on.

09:51.432 --> 09:53.533
You guys are uncomfortable with
Mahmoud because he's Muslim.

09:53.567 --> 09:55.368
What? What are you
talking about?

09:55.402 --> 09:57.337
This is your post-9/11 racism
talking.

09:57.371 --> 09:59.839
I, for one, think it's great
that Peter has enough

09:59.874 --> 10:01.975
of an open mind
to have a Muslim friend.

10:02.009 --> 10:05.044
You know, a lot of dogs
just sit outside, tied to poles.

10:05.079 --> 10:06.546
Look, Mahmoud's my friend, okay?

10:06.580 --> 10:09.415
So he's Muslim.
Every culture has its quirks.

10:09.450 --> 10:11.384
Italian guys talk
with their hands a lot,

10:11.418 --> 10:12.886
Irish guys drink a lot,

10:12.920 --> 10:15.588
black guys change their shirts
while they tell you a story.

10:15.623 --> 10:17.824
So, how's Bernadette?
She's all right.

10:17.858 --> 10:19.459
She's taking interior
design classes

10:19.493 --> 10:21.060
down at the
community college.

10:21.095 --> 10:22.929
I mean, she's good at
haircutting and everything.

10:22.963 --> 10:25.164
They gave her the chair
right by the door.

10:25.199 --> 10:26.699
But I guess now
she wants

10:26.734 --> 10:28.601
to hang plates on the
wall or whatever.

10:28.636 --> 10:30.336
And you know she gained
the weight back

10:30.371 --> 10:31.337
from the Lap-Band,
right?

10:31.372 --> 10:33.006
That Bernadette
and her pie.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.474
You know it, brother.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.976
Okay, I'm gonna go eat this steak
in the bathroom.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.112
Thanks for getting
dinner, man.

10:45.152 --> 10:47.921
Wow, this place is
really cool, Mahmoud.

10:47.955 --> 10:50.290
It's like ear-bloodening
sounds had sex

10:50.324 --> 10:53.026
with nose-bloodening smells
and this is their baby.

10:53.060 --> 10:54.827
I am glad
you are enjoying yourself.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.163
Would you like some
of my meat fooshnoosh?

10:57.197 --> 10:59.599
It's a chicken that has
been yelled at for two hours

10:59.633 --> 11:01.434
and then run over
by a Mercedes.

11:01.468 --> 11:03.202
Mmm! Mmm! Oh!

11:03.237 --> 11:05.271
You can really taste
the fear in the chicken.

11:05.306 --> 11:06.372
You know, Peter,

11:06.407 --> 11:08.074
a lot of people are
not as accepting

11:08.108 --> 11:09.676
of Muslim culture
as you are.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.644
Well, I think everything
about it is the best.

11:11.679 --> 11:12.879
Like this hookah.

11:12.913 --> 11:14.447
I mean, who doesn't want
to sit around a table

11:14.481 --> 11:16.482
with a bunch of guys and
suck on the same thing?

11:20.254 --> 11:23.389
Mmm, it's like smoking
my grandfather's jacket.

11:23.424 --> 11:25.458
Man, I wish I could stay
here all night, Mahmoud.

11:25.492 --> 11:26.793
But I'm supposed
to pick up

11:26.827 --> 11:28.148
the dry cleaning
before it closes.

11:28.162 --> 11:29.762
I killed a mouse
with my tie.

11:29.797 --> 11:30.797
Nonsense.

11:30.831 --> 11:32.298
I'll have my wife
pick it up for you.

11:32.333 --> 11:33.599
What?
She'd do that?

11:33.634 --> 11:35.735
Oh, absolutely.

11:35.769 --> 11:38.104
I need you to run an errand
for my friend Peter.

11:38.138 --> 11:39.138
Of course.

11:39.173 --> 11:40.840
Anything for you,
husband.

11:41.976 --> 11:43.142
That was amazing.

11:43.177 --> 11:44.877
She just listened
to everything you said.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.112
Of course she listened.

11:46.146 --> 11:47.180
In Muslim culture,

11:47.214 --> 11:48.982
wives are much more obedient.

11:49.016 --> 11:50.516
No way!
That's awesome!

11:50.551 --> 11:51.951
So wait, let me
get this straight:

11:51.986 --> 11:53.619
Sweet hat, obedient wife,

11:53.654 --> 11:55.955
and I get to shout
"Admiral Akbar"

11:55.990 --> 11:57.023
when I do stuff?

11:57.057 --> 11:59.892
You, sir, have got
yourself a Muslim.

12:05.499 --> 12:06.666
Peter, where
are you going?

12:06.700 --> 12:08.201
And why are you
dressed like that?

12:08.235 --> 12:10.069
Well, Lois, I happen
to be a Muslim now,

12:10.104 --> 12:11.804
which means I'll be
spending a lot of my time

12:11.839 --> 12:14.007
in mostly-empty cafes,
watching soccer

12:14.041 --> 12:15.842
on an eight-inch
black-and-white TV.

12:15.876 --> 12:17.677
Yes! The team I like
is kicking it!

12:17.711 --> 12:19.579
Oh no! The team I don't like
is kicking it!

12:19.613 --> 12:21.614
Yes! The team I like
is kicking it again!

12:21.648 --> 12:23.516
I will celebrate
with finger cymbals.

12:25.753 --> 12:26.986
Hey, is that for real,

12:27.021 --> 12:30.056
that-that "Diarrhea Only" sign
on your bathroom?

12:33.093 --> 12:34.794
Peter, this is my friend Omar.

12:34.828 --> 12:36.662
He can teach you many things
about our faith,

12:36.697 --> 12:38.097
including how to ululate.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.799
What's that?
It's this:

12:41.068 --> 12:43.002
Oh, my God!
That's terrifying.

12:43.037 --> 12:44.237
I don't know if
I'm ready for that.

12:44.271 --> 12:45.571
No, Peter, it's okay.

12:45.606 --> 12:47.540
Just sing the
beginning of "La Bamba,"

12:47.574 --> 12:49.106
but don't say the
"La Bamba" part.

12:49.131 --> 12:50.109
Oh, okay.

12:50.110 --> 12:51.377
Yes, good job!

12:51.412 --> 12:52.578
You're doing it!
♪ Bamba.

12:52.613 --> 12:54.047
Ooh, so close.

12:56.016 --> 12:58.718
All right, Lois,
I'm off to the bazaar.

12:58.752 --> 12:59.719
What do you mean?

12:59.753 --> 13:00.720
You mean the market?

13:00.754 --> 13:01.788
Yeah, the bazaar.

13:01.822 --> 13:02.989
Well, if you're
going to the market,

13:03.023 --> 13:04.223
can you pick
up some cereal,

13:04.258 --> 13:05.538
some butter, and
a loaf of bread?

13:05.559 --> 13:06.893
I'll see what
they have.

13:06.927 --> 13:08.694
All right, Lois.

13:08.729 --> 13:10.329
Here's six cobras,
a bolt of silk,

13:10.364 --> 13:11.431
and a ram's horn.

13:11.465 --> 13:12.532
Peter, what the hell?

13:12.566 --> 13:14.600
Hey, can you help me
with the 20 paper bags

13:14.635 --> 13:16.035
of dates I got in the car?

13:16.070 --> 13:18.404
Why the hell would you
get 20 bags of dates?

13:18.439 --> 13:20.540
The monkey in the little
vest who was selling them

13:20.574 --> 13:21.808
happened to be
very persuasive.

13:21.842 --> 13:22.909
You know what?

13:22.943 --> 13:23.910
Fine.

13:23.944 --> 13:25.511
I'm just gonna
assume this will pass,

13:25.546 --> 13:28.581
like your "everywhere is a
racquetball court" phase.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.928
So, Mike, now that you've
thoroughly kicked my butt

13:41.962 --> 13:43.763
all over the court,
what do you say we take

13:43.797 --> 13:45.865
one quick second to talk
about the Wichita account?

13:45.899 --> 13:48.101
And let me assure you,
my racquetball game

13:48.135 --> 13:50.770
is no indication of how we do
business here at J.T. Stern.

13:51.805 --> 13:53.506
Okay, zero serving zero.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.310
I have to say, Peter,

13:57.344 --> 13:58.744
I am impressed by how much

13:58.779 --> 14:00.279
you have committed
yourself to Islam.

14:00.314 --> 14:01.547
Are you kidding?
It's awesome.

14:01.582 --> 14:03.249
I even started wearing
leather sandals

14:03.283 --> 14:04.717
with way-too-long
toenails.

14:04.751 --> 14:06.352
See how the big ones
are getting yellow?

14:06.386 --> 14:08.287
Ah, yes, very Muslim.

14:08.322 --> 14:10.690
Listen, Peter, some
friends of mine and I

14:10.724 --> 14:11.991
are getting
together tonight

14:12.025 --> 14:13.860
and we wanted to invite
you to join us.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.828
O.M.A.

14:15.863 --> 14:17.130
I am so there!

14:17.164 --> 14:18.698
Whose crappy van
should we take?

14:18.732 --> 14:20.133
Actually, we are
meeting here.

14:20.167 --> 14:22.068
Follow me.

14:23.804 --> 14:24.770
Oh, hey, you guys.

14:24.805 --> 14:26.139
Hey, is anyone
gonna object

14:26.173 --> 14:27.974
if I pick my nose
with a dagger?

14:28.008 --> 14:29.442
Mahmoud,
who is this man?

14:29.476 --> 14:30.743
Why would you
bring him here?

14:30.777 --> 14:32.411
Do not worry.
This is Peter.

14:32.446 --> 14:33.746
He believes
in our cause.

14:33.780 --> 14:35.181
How can
you be sure?

14:35.215 --> 14:36.215
Give him the test.

14:38.485 --> 14:39.585
Who is better?

14:39.620 --> 14:41.854
Hulk Hogan or the Iron Sheik?

14:41.889 --> 14:44.190
Um, the Iron Sheik?

14:44.224 --> 14:46.025
Okay. He is one of us.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.160
I told you.

14:47.194 --> 14:48.961
Look at him,
he is the perfect man

14:48.996 --> 14:51.063
to help us blow up
the Quahog Bridge.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.067
Ah! Oh my God!

14:55.102 --> 14:56.068
Everybody down!

14:57.337 --> 14:59.572
So are these toys just, like,
to take?

15:05.996 --> 15:08.097
Hey, guys, what football
team should I like?

15:08.131 --> 15:09.465
Mahmoud says
we all need

15:09.499 --> 15:11.133
to act like we're fans
of American football

15:11.167 --> 15:14.737
so we seem less...
b-buh... buhspicious.

15:14.771 --> 15:16.171
What?
What are you talking about?

15:16.206 --> 15:17.573
I'm talking about Mahmoud.

15:17.607 --> 15:19.475
You know, I actually feel
really bad for him.

15:19.509 --> 15:22.511
Did you know he knew 19 guys
who died on 9/11?

15:22.546 --> 15:23.846
I mean, what are the odds?

15:23.880 --> 15:25.147
Peter, I think
you joined

15:25.181 --> 15:26.582
a terrorist
sleeper cell.

15:26.616 --> 15:28.050
What?! That's crazy.

15:28.084 --> 15:29.852
Look, I'm gonna
call Mahmoud right now

15:29.886 --> 15:31.320
on this cell
phone he gave me.

15:31.354 --> 15:32.121
He'll tell you.

15:34.958 --> 15:35.991
Damn phone's busted.

15:36.026 --> 15:37.059
Maybe I dialed wrong.

15:40.497 --> 15:42.331
Peter, please stop trying
to call Mahmoud.

15:42.365 --> 15:43.499
This is very
serious.

15:43.533 --> 15:44.967
Your friends
are terrorists.

15:45.001 --> 15:46.201
Think about it.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.636
They're... they're
meeting in secret,

15:47.671 --> 15:49.471
they're creating
cover stories...

15:49.506 --> 15:51.040
Oh, my God, you're right!

15:51.074 --> 15:52.975
See, I told you
Mahmoud was bad news!

15:53.009 --> 15:54.510
Those guys are
all bad news.

15:54.544 --> 15:55.945
Hang on there,
Quagmire.

15:55.979 --> 15:58.013
Just because these few
guys are terrorists

15:58.048 --> 15:59.548
doesn't mean
all Muslims are.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.951
Every ethnic group
has their nut-jobs.

16:01.985 --> 16:04.119
We have the Unabomber,
Timothy McVeigh,

16:04.154 --> 16:06.188
and even that fat guy
at the Atlanta Olympics

16:06.222 --> 16:07.890
who didn't do it,
but he looked mean,

16:07.924 --> 16:09.258
so we said he did.

16:09.292 --> 16:11.412
Joe, you don't get to talk
about the regular Olympics.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.028
Well, I gotta go
down there right now

16:13.063 --> 16:14.697
and tell Mahmoud we can't
be friends anymore.

16:14.731 --> 16:15.831
Wait a minute, Peter.

16:15.865 --> 16:17.933
This could actually
be an opportunity.

16:17.968 --> 16:19.802
You're already
in their group.

16:19.836 --> 16:21.136
They trust you.

16:21.171 --> 16:23.505
If you can find out what
they're planning next,

16:23.540 --> 16:26.208
we might actually be able
to stop an act of terror.

16:26.242 --> 16:27.610
You'd be a hero.

16:27.644 --> 16:30.245
Well, I...
I could try.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.880
I mean, I am a
pretty good actor.

16:31.915 --> 16:33.449
Remember how upset
I seemed to get

16:33.483 --> 16:34.917
when Lois said she
was leaving town

16:34.951 --> 16:36.452
with the kids
for a few days?

16:36.486 --> 16:38.821
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
miss you guys so much.

16:38.855 --> 16:40.456
Don't forget to call
and let me know

16:40.490 --> 16:42.491
exactly when
you'll be back.

16:42.525 --> 16:43.525
Get out.

16:47.831 --> 16:49.398
Okay, you're all set.

16:49.432 --> 16:52.301
Remember, we'll be in the van
listening to everything,

16:52.335 --> 16:53.569
so if anything goes wrong,

16:53.603 --> 16:55.070
we'll pull you right
out of there.

16:55.105 --> 16:56.205
Don't you worry, Joe.

16:56.239 --> 16:57.906
I'll blend in
like a chameleon

16:57.941 --> 16:59.742
in Courtney
Love's crotch.

16:59.776 --> 17:01.343
Oh my God!

17:01.378 --> 17:02.611
Where did you
just come from?

17:02.646 --> 17:05.748
A very, very
bad hiding place.

17:09.185 --> 17:11.185
Okay, before we get started,

17:11.221 --> 17:13.088
I have an announcement
from headquarters.

17:13.123 --> 17:14.723
"No more shorts."

17:14.758 --> 17:17.226
And this isn't coming from me,
this is management.

17:17.260 --> 17:18.727
This is about me, isn't it?

17:18.762 --> 17:20.095
They don't name names.

17:20.130 --> 17:23.598
They just say,
"No more shorts," okay?

17:23.633 --> 17:25.367
All right, this is our target.

17:25.402 --> 17:26.468
The Quahog Bridge.

17:26.502 --> 17:28.137
We loaded a van
with explosives,

17:28.171 --> 17:29.772
which we will drive
to the bridge and...

17:29.806 --> 17:31.407
Wait a minute-- explosives?

17:31.441 --> 17:33.442
Is this not improv class?

17:33.476 --> 17:34.109
No.

17:34.144 --> 17:35.110
Is...

17:35.145 --> 17:36.211
is this improv?

17:36.246 --> 17:37.613
Are you doing improv?

17:37.647 --> 17:39.448
No. Now get out that door!

17:42.719 --> 17:44.086
The real door!

17:45.655 --> 17:47.056
Yes, I have a question:

17:47.090 --> 17:49.191
When exactly are we
doing the bombing?

17:49.225 --> 17:50.693
The attack will
happen tomorrow

17:50.727 --> 17:52.261
during afternoon
rush hour.

17:52.295 --> 17:54.229
And that's actually where
you come in, Peter.

17:54.264 --> 17:56.999
In order to get past the
checkpoint at the toll plaza,

17:57.033 --> 17:59.468
we will need an American
behind the wheel

17:59.502 --> 18:01.770
to arouse the least amount
of suspicion.

18:01.805 --> 18:03.172
Sorry, can you repeat all that?

18:03.206 --> 18:05.207
I just had an itch
right by my microphone.

18:05.241 --> 18:06.241
Microphone?!

18:07.310 --> 18:08.544
He's wearing a wire!

18:12.682 --> 18:14.416
Hey, Joe, can I ask
you a question?

18:14.451 --> 18:16.151
Can you fart?
Oh, of course I can.

18:16.186 --> 18:17.486
I've got a button
for it right here.

18:19.055 --> 18:20.055
Aw, cool!

18:22.025 --> 18:23.926
Hold on. Oh, no!

18:23.960 --> 18:25.728
It sounds like they
found Peter's wire!

18:25.762 --> 18:27.429
Change of plans.

18:27.464 --> 18:29.798
The attack happens now.

18:37.540 --> 18:38.707
Now drive.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.576
Man, I never thought
it would end like this.

18:40.610 --> 18:42.277
Why, what did
you imagine?

18:42.312 --> 18:45.147
Basically the same thing,
only Nathan Lane.

18:45.181 --> 18:48.117
♪ Now, drive!

19:00.697 --> 19:02.164
Okay, you're
good to go.

19:06.503 --> 19:08.070
Pull over up here.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.708
Please, Mahmoud,
don't do this.

19:12.742 --> 19:13.776
It is too late.

19:13.810 --> 19:15.010
The job must be done.

19:15.044 --> 19:16.812
Look, I know you're mad
at our government,

19:16.846 --> 19:19.581
but you gotta realize,
that's only part of America.

19:19.616 --> 19:20.983
We're the land of the free

19:21.017 --> 19:23.185
and the home of the sunburnt,
freckled fat guy.

19:23.219 --> 19:25.487
A place where Jenny McCarthy
has a role

19:25.522 --> 19:27.489
in the debate over
childhood vaccinations.

19:27.524 --> 19:29.858
A country where you can walk
into any IHOP

19:29.893 --> 19:31.293
and see black women fighting.

19:31.327 --> 19:33.462
And where Ubu is considered
a good dog

19:33.496 --> 19:34.696
even though he never sat.

19:34.731 --> 19:36.698
We're the proud nation
where someone can

19:36.733 --> 19:38.734
shoot up their entire workplace
with a thing,

19:38.768 --> 19:41.570
and then the next day nobody
talks about banning that thing.

19:41.604 --> 19:43.772
It's the land that
lets people on Twitter

19:43.807 --> 19:45.874
spell the word "their"
any way they want.

19:45.909 --> 19:47.543
And where, if you think
you can dance,

19:47.577 --> 19:50.345
that assertion will be
challenged and evaluated.

19:50.380 --> 19:51.446
For we...

19:51.481 --> 19:53.115
are America.

19:53.149 --> 19:54.516
You will not convince me.

19:54.551 --> 19:56.952
America must pay for its sins!

20:00.490 --> 20:01.957
Hold it right there!

20:04.294 --> 20:06.328
Mahmoud, you're under arrest.

20:06.362 --> 20:08.764
Look, Joe,
I drove a van.

20:15.138 --> 20:17.773
Oh, Peter,
I'm so glad you're okay.

20:17.807 --> 20:19.474
Oh, me too, Lois.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.009
That was some
pretty rough stuff.

20:21.044 --> 20:24.046
You... you didn't
cry, did you?

20:24.080 --> 20:26.315
Well, I mean, I went
through an awful lot.

20:26.349 --> 20:28.784
Peter, if you cried,
we are done.

20:28.818 --> 20:30.319
Great job, Peter.

20:30.353 --> 20:32.654
Thanks to you, 30 terrorists are
behind bars,

20:32.689 --> 20:34.323
and every middle-class Arab
in this town

20:34.357 --> 20:36.291
is now under suspicion.

20:36.326 --> 20:37.292
So what
happens next,

20:37.327 --> 20:38.448
do those guys
all get trials?

20:38.461 --> 20:40.696
Well, you know...

20:40.730 --> 20:44.032
It's a long... it's the
process, and... whatever.

20:44.067 --> 20:45.300
Well, what do
you guys say

20:45.335 --> 20:46.969
we all go celebrate
at the Clam?

20:47.003 --> 20:48.136
That's a great idea.

20:48.171 --> 20:50.072
Yeah, I think we could
all use a drink.

20:50.106 --> 20:51.607
Tell you what,
let me call Horace

20:51.641 --> 20:53.842
and tell him to
get our table ready.

20:55.845 --> 20:57.813
Peter, did you just...
Let's go, let's go, let's go...
