00:03.938 --> 00:07.206
Oh, boy.
Working at my desk.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.641
I think I'd rather walk in
on you and my brother.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.477
(chuckles)
Hey.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.979
Hi, honey.
I needed more space.

00:13.981 --> 00:15.647
We talked about this.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.850
You working at my desk
was a one-time experiment

00:17.852 --> 00:19.551
that failed,
like Obamacare.

00:19.553 --> 00:23.022
Mike, my desk is
ridiculously small... (sighs)

00:23.024 --> 00:24.890
...and I have all these midterms
to grade.

00:24.892 --> 00:27.059
There just wasn't enough room
for the tests and --

00:27.061 --> 00:28.861
oh, my tears.

00:28.863 --> 00:31.463
Why didn't you just use
the kitchen table?

00:31.465 --> 00:34.133
I tried.
I-I can't focus near cake.

00:34.135 --> 00:38.637
Come on, we -- we've shared
spaces a lot smaller than this.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.706
Oh, remember
our Leetsdale apartment?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.207
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.976
Used to dream about
moving into a tollbooth

00:43.978 --> 00:46.478
so I could have
more elbow room.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.880
I loved that place.
Yeah.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.148
You know,
we had that foosball table,

00:49.150 --> 00:50.549
and -- and we would cut out

00:50.551 --> 00:51.917
magazine pictures
and put them on the walls.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.086
Yeah. Well, we didn't
have money for art.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.220
Mm.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.722
We blew all our money
on luxuries,

00:56.724 --> 00:58.190
like heat and soap.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.291
(laughs)

00:59.293 --> 01:02.928
Well, we may not have have had
a lot of space or stuff,

01:02.930 --> 01:04.096
but we had fun.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.431
Yeah, good story.
Yeah.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.400
Anyhow, let's fast-forward
to the part

01:08.402 --> 01:10.636
where we have a big home
and we're rich.

01:11.772 --> 01:12.871
All right.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.540
Mike,
just give me an hour,

01:14.542 --> 01:16.542
and I'll get out
of your hair.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.043
Okay, well, how much time
have you been here?

01:18.045 --> 01:21.013
I want that to count
against your hour.

01:21.015 --> 01:24.049
I promise, when you need
to work at the desk,

01:24.051 --> 01:25.617
then I'll be happy
to move.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.553
Okay.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.021
I need to work at my desk.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.290
Really?

01:31.292 --> 01:34.126
I need to work at a way
not to share my desk.

01:35.529 --> 01:38.597
-- Captions by VITAC --

01:42.369 --> 01:44.303
They're called She Sheds.
Yeah?

01:44.305 --> 01:46.538
It's like a Man Cave
for women.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.873
So, instead of
the football stuff and cigars,

01:47.875 --> 01:48.874
we have taste.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.409
(chuckles)

01:50.411 --> 01:51.410
Cool, right?

01:51.412 --> 01:52.611
It doesn't have to be cool.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.246
I just have to get your mom
in it.

01:54.248 --> 01:57.282
Hey, guys.
Hi.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.617
So, what are you doing
over there?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.085
We just might've solved
your problem

02:00.087 --> 02:01.453
about using my office.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.255
I don't have a problem
with that.

02:03.257 --> 02:06.658
Well, whoever's problem it is,
I'm gonna fix it.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.227
Stand here.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.828
I want you to look out
by the back of the fence.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.063
See that area right there?

02:11.065 --> 02:12.931
That's gonna be
your new office.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.734
In the birdhouse?
No, no.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.436
The birds
go in the birdhouse.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.570
Why are you always trying
to take somebody else's space?

02:18.572 --> 02:19.838
Ah, no.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.406
Listen.
No, no, no, no.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.442
Left of that,
that little flat area,

02:23.444 --> 02:25.244
I'm gonna build you
your own...

02:25.246 --> 02:27.412
She Shed!

02:27.414 --> 02:29.581
A shed?

02:29.583 --> 02:30.916
Well...
A shed?

02:30.918 --> 02:32.784
So I'm on the same level
as a lawn mower now?

02:32.786 --> 02:34.987
No. These are
custom-built sheds,

02:34.989 --> 02:36.588
like something
you have a home.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.823
It's -- it's like a house

02:37.825 --> 02:39.791
that'd be outside,
like an out...

02:39.793 --> 02:41.760
That's not right. No.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.428
Here, check them out.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.830
She Sheds
are super trendy.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.798
Bethenny from "Real Housewives"
has one.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.367
Yeah, Bethenny has one.

02:48.369 --> 02:51.203
It's the perfect place to work
or unwind

02:51.205 --> 02:53.272

in your frenemy's face.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.274
You like Chardonnay.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.575
Okay, let's stop.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.811
Oh, wow. Yeah.
Uh-huh.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.513
They're actually pretty nice.
Yeah.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.282
Yeah. You -- you would build
one of those for me?

03:03.284 --> 03:05.217
Anything
for my beautiful lawn mower.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.818
(laughs) Yeah,
but it'll take too long.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.954
I need space now.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.656
These come in kits.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.991
I could build one of those
in three days.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.126
I'll get Kyle to help you.

03:14.128 --> 03:15.594

"Employee of the Month."

I've won, like, a zillion times.

And I've swallowed
a butterfly.

Me.

the suspense was killing me.

after I came up
with Break Room Bingo.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.013
Yes.
Because before that,

04:08.015 --> 04:10.716
all you could do
in the break room was relax.

to this mandatory gathering.

You know,
but when you first asked me,

05:33.867 --> 05:35.901
I thought you said
"Sheep Shed."

We had one of those when I was a kid.
Uh-huh.

05:38.639 --> 05:39.971

and count them.

Which backfired.
Because for having hooves,

05:44.545 --> 05:47.546
they are are surprisingly good
at stealing blankets.

05:47.548 --> 05:51.350
I'm just saying I'm glad
it's not a Sheep Shed,

05:51.352 --> 05:53.352
you know, because the friends
you make in there

05:53.354 --> 05:54.386
you eventually eat.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.188
That's farm life.

eyelashes at you in the morning,

to go
to the hardware store.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.369
On it, sir.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.674

cramped, little desk of hers.

"Hell, I make more money."

some sanctuary.

Out here all isolated.
Love it.

Plus, it's got one thing
my office doesn't have.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.664
A nice person in it.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.501
A door. I've always wanted
my office to have a door.

06:42.503 --> 06:45.036
You can shut the world out.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.539
Just be in all by yourself
with your thoughts

06:47.541 --> 06:48.940
and a big plate of nachos.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.877
But this<i> is</i> for Vanessa,
right?

06:51.879 --> 06:53.879
Yeah, yeah,
but I'm worried.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.348
She won't like it way out here
'cause it's so lonely.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.850
Wait, you mean
I'm wasting my weekend

06:58.852 --> 07:01.019
building a shed
that's not even gonna be used?

07:01.021 --> 07:04.289
I'm a tad --
No, I'm a full smidge pissed.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.092
Calm down. We're gonna
finish the project.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.529
But I'm thinking
maybe turning this She Shed

07:10.531 --> 07:13.265
into a<i> He</i> Shed.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.566
So you're just gonna
take it from her?

07:14.568 --> 07:16.301
No, I'm not gonna
take it from her.

07:16.303 --> 07:19.404
I'm gonna convince her that
she doesn't really want it.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.073
And that it would be
a better idea if I had it.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.643
That way
we'll both be happy.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.311
That's a lot of dominoes,
Baxter.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.280
Good luck.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.782
Sometimes I wonder why that
woman stays married to you.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.820
I think you need to go
to the hardware store.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.164
Surprise!

07:53.807 --> 07:59.144
Well, I'm, uh...
definitely surprised.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.812
Oh, you -- you
don't like it.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.615
No, no, no, no, no.
It's -- it's just...

08:03.617 --> 08:05.584
I-I mean, I know you didn't
have a ton of time...  Yeah.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.752
...but it just -- it looks
nothing like the pictures.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.321
It seems
less like an office

08:09.323 --> 08:11.990
and more like a place
you'd be taken for a whuppin'.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.363
Well, technically, whuppin's
happen behind sheds.

08:18.365 --> 08:21.199
But I-I-I get it.
It's -- It's just not great.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.835
It's just, uh --
It's kind of cold in here, too.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.371
Yeah, well, it is a shed.
Yeah.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.672
But the good thing is,

08:27.674 --> 08:30.108
in the summer
it's uncomfortably hot.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.444
So it kind of balances out. Oh.

08:32.446 --> 08:33.712
I guess -- I guess
I could just --

08:33.714 --> 08:34.946
I could put a desk
right here.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.182
I'm putting it
right there.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.451
No, I -- what I mean,
you'd have your desk right here.

What,
are those mousetraps?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.154
Well,
the -- the little ones are.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.890
The big ones
are for skunks.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.994
Let me handle
rodent control.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.795
You know what? I know.
It's okay. It's okay.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.197
You don't like the place. I don't
want you suffering out here.

No. No. An awesome one.
No, you did this for me, Mike.

I am gonna make it work.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.504
Oh, make it work.
Yeah.

08:59.506 --> 09:00.839
Oh, I -- you know,
last time you said that,

09:00.841 --> 09:02.173
it involved that jumpsuit,

09:02.175 --> 09:04.209

so well, did it?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.511

the riblet basket --

I got the feeling that people
weren't too happy about it.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.356
Nobody said anything
to me.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.924
Hmm.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.039
Mr. Alzate is the one
that counts the votes,

current runs through both of our wiring.

I pick Kyle

17:47.267 --> 17:49.667
because he gets my coffee
in the morning,

17:49.669 --> 17:52.403

of the Month" parking spot,

17:52.405 --> 17:54.439
it's still hot
when it gets here.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.210
But this month,
after you fired Oliver,

17:59.212 --> 18:01.345
