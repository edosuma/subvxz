reorganizing, just for kicks

in Indianapolis

29:10.749 --> 29:11.967

what to look for,

29:13.708 --> 29:15.057

29:15.101 --> 29:17.320
This fire started
with a faulty refrigerator.

29:17.364 --> 29:19.670
Just like the Grandbrook
trailer fires.

I can't say for sure
without a floor plan,

that Grandbrook uses.

- Very.

29:31.944 --> 29:34.294
Now you want to hear
what I learned?

29:34.337 --> 29:36.731
This trailer was sold
by a company

29:36.775 --> 29:39.429
called CWG Building Systems.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.083
- Catchy name.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.737
I couldn't find out
much about them,

29:42.781 --> 29:45.131
except that they were
incorporated on the same day

29:45.174 --> 29:46.523

29:46.567 --> 29:48.787
as two known
Grandbrook subsidiaries.

29:48.830 --> 29:51.790
- You think they're related.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.095
So here's my theory.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.836
Once we exposed
Grandbrook trailers

29:54.880 --> 29:56.577
as the firetraps they are,

29:56.620 --> 29:59.101
Grandbrook transferred their
inventory to this shell company

29:59.145 --> 30:01.887
and kept on selling them
under a different name.

30:01.930 --> 30:05.281
- Sure sounds like it.
- Oh, I need proof, though.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.283

to Bloomington tomorrow.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.677
CWG owns a facility
down there.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.462
It might be where
they're keeping those trailers.

30:12.506 --> 30:17.250
After that voicemail?

30:17.293 --> 30:20.122
- Matt, I appreciate
your concern,

drug lords to get a story.

I wanted to see you, actually.
- Oh, okay.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.729
- It's about
the calendar, Donna.

37:33.773 --> 37:37.516
You know the one I mean.
1990.

37:39.822 --> 37:43.783
Wallace's calendar.
- Yeah, that is the one.

37:43.826 --> 37:45.915
So...

37:45.959 --> 37:48.657
How much do you want?
Name your price.

37:48.701 --> 37:50.877
- Oh, well, I don't have it.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.053
I thought you were going to say
that you found one.

37:53.096 --> 37:55.795
- Mm-mm.

37:55.838 --> 37:57.840
Wallace swears,
when he made Chief,

37:57.884 --> 38:01.888
that he tracked down every copy
and destroyed it, so.

38:01.931 --> 38:04.847
- I believe it.
- Yeah.

38:04.891 --> 38:08.590
- I guess it's lost
to the ages.

38:08.634 --> 38:12.072
It's just a shame.

38:12.115 --> 38:15.336
All right, anyway,
have a good night, Donna.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.382
- You, too.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.862
- You look nice.
- Oh, thanks.

38:27.435 --> 38:29.655
- Your friend, Christopher.
He asked me about the calendar.

38:29.698 --> 38:33.049
- Heh, I thought he would.
What'd you say?

38:33.093 --> 38:37.489
- Oh, well, I'm certainly
not going to tell him...

38:37.532 --> 38:39.317
the truth.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.586
- Oh, don't you
shake your head at me.

38:47.629 --> 38:50.197
That's one of my favorite
things in this world,

38:50.240 --> 38:52.547
and I don't intend to share it.

38:57.857 --> 38:59.989
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

39:00.033 --> 39:02.470
You know, we don't actually
have to go out to dinner.

39:02.514 --> 39:03.950
Terrence is with my mom
all evening,

39:03.993 --> 39:06.822
and we have the whole place
to ourselves, so.

39:06.866 --> 39:09.782
- So the reservation
is cancelled.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.719
- Looks like
it's locked up tight.

39:33.762 --> 39:36.548
- Pretty high security
for a bunch of used trailers.

39:36.591 --> 39:38.985
- Well, from the outside,

39:39.028 --> 39:41.509
they sure look like
the Grandbrooks.

39:42.684 --> 39:47.297
Uh, it's too dark to get
a decent pic from here.
