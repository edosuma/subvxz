WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:02.563
Previously on HANNIBAL.

00:02.600 --> 00:04.727
- I'm a good fisherman, Jack.
- You hook him,

00:04.770 --> 00:06.738
I'll land him.

00:06.770 --> 00:10.558
- Never seen pigs like these.
- They're a special breed.

00:10.610 --> 00:14.478
Riding agrees with you.
You've got a bloom.

00:14.510 --> 00:16.375
- I don't get a legacy.
- (Lecter): Unless you make one.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.571
- She's pathological.
I'm sure she's told you

00:18.610 --> 00:22.114
horrible things that I've done.
They're going to find

00:22.150 --> 00:24.516
something wrong
with your lady parts, Margot.

00:24.550 --> 00:27.383
You must be the baby daddy.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.379
- Dr. Lecter's the one you want
to be feeding to your pigs.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.421
Can you explain my actions?

00:35.430 --> 00:38.399
Can you posit my intentions?

00:40.300 --> 00:43.337
What would be
your theory of my mind?

00:43.370 --> 00:47.101
- I have an understanding
of your state of mind.

00:47.140 --> 00:49.244
You understand mine.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.248
We're just alike.

00:51.280 --> 00:54.670
This gives you
the capacity to deceive me...

00:54.720 --> 00:57.211
and be deceived by me.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.150
- I'm not deceiving you,
Dr. Lecter.

00:59.190 --> 01:02.125
I'm just pointing out the snare

01:02.160 --> 01:04.082
around your neck.

01:04.130 --> 01:06.826
What you do about it
is entirely up to you.

01:09.130 --> 01:11.325
- You put the snare
around my neck.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.536
Why did you tell Mason Verger
I want to kill him?

01:20.910 --> 01:25.074
- I was curious
what would happen.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.114
It's true, isn't it?

01:30.150 --> 01:33.119
You do want to kill him.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.254
Or you want me
to kill him.

01:36.290 --> 01:38.281
Either way,
you'd like him dead.

01:38.330 --> 01:40.696
I'm just...

01:40.730 --> 01:43.164
giving you a little nudge.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.863
- Mason is discourteous.

01:46.900 --> 01:52.179
And discourtesy
is unspeakably ugly to me.

01:54.180 --> 01:57.104
- Are you thinking
about eating him?

01:58.750 --> 02:02.345
- Whenever feasible, one should
always try to eat the rude.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.459
- Free-range rude.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.121
- Would you join me
at the table?

02:13.730 --> 02:16.119
- Mason Verger is a pig...

02:17.930 --> 02:20.592
...and he deserves
to be somebody's bacon.

02:25.510 --> 02:29.298
Maybe you should kill Mason
during your next session.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.478
- He may be intending to kill me
during our next session.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.671
- Then you'll have
to kill him first.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.684
- You said you were curious

02:39.720 --> 02:42.587
what would happen.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.383
I want you
to close your eyes, Will.

02:45.430 --> 02:48.558
Imagine what you would like
to happen.

04:21.620 --> 04:23.349
(pigs squealing and grunting)

04:31.900 --> 04:34.664
What did you see?

04:49.420 --> 04:54.414
(theme music)

05:12.440 --> 05:14.408
- Good.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.944
Garbage.

05:17.980 --> 05:20.073
Shall we talk about

05:20.120 --> 05:22.941
what happened to poor Margot?

05:22.990 --> 05:26.687
- We can get to that later.
- Oh, we can get to it now.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.780
Family affairs are best left

05:29.830 --> 05:32.822
to the family, Dr. Lecter,
and you interfered.

05:32.860 --> 05:35.988
- I provided counsel.
- You subverted me.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.395
- While you were subverting
the underprivileged children

05:40.440 --> 05:42.408
at your summer camp.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.408
What did you learn?

05:44.440 --> 05:47.773
-Hmmmm

05:47.810 --> 05:49.869
Keen student
of the Bible

05:49.910 --> 05:53.778
that I am...

05:53.820 --> 05:57.119
I learned about suffering.

05:57.150 --> 05:59.812
Not mine, mind you,

05:59.860 --> 06:01.987
but the general...

06:02.020 --> 06:04.818
conceit.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.921
- God's choices
in inflicting suffering

06:09.970 --> 06:13.133
are not satisfactory to us,

06:13.170 --> 06:15.832
nor are they understandable,

06:15.870 --> 06:19.408
unless innocence offends him.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.000
(laughing)

06:22.040 --> 06:24.440
- Clearly, he needs help

06:24.480 --> 06:26.948
in directing his blind fury

06:26.980 --> 06:30.609
with which he flogs this earth.

06:30.650 --> 06:33.813
- Margot's happiness is more
important than her suffering.

06:33.860 --> 06:37.853
- You say that as though the two
are mutually exclusive.

06:37.890 --> 06:41.121
- I believe they are.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.628
- Can never say to a certainty.

06:43.670 --> 06:47.561
It is one of those things
that is...

06:47.600 --> 06:49.830
"hid"...

06:49.870 --> 06:51.861
as the Bible says.

06:53.880 --> 06:57.543
Papa taught me
how to hide

06:57.580 --> 07:00.071
all sorts of things.

07:07.090 --> 07:09.979
This was his knife.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.158
I carry it around with me

07:13.200 --> 07:16.624
to remind me of him.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.468
- Whose fat are you planning
to measure today, Mason?

07:19.500 --> 07:21.468
Mine?

07:21.500 --> 07:23.809
- No fat on you.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.808
Take more than a flesh wound

07:25.840 --> 07:28.104
to make you squeal.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.940
What game of chicken

07:33.980 --> 07:36.778
are you and the sperm donor

07:36.820 --> 07:39.584
playing, Dr. Lecter?

07:39.620 --> 07:41.679
Don't get me wrong.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.178
I play chicken
with Margot all the time.

07:45.230 --> 07:48.654
I just don't tell her
I'm playing.

07:50.700 --> 07:54.568
I'm good at chicken, Dr. Lecter.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.636
I never blink.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.535
(Mason laughing)

07:58.570 --> 08:00.834
Just send me the bill.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.940
I'm so sorry.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.766
- They could have done
what was done laparoscopically,

08:25.800 --> 08:27.768
but my brother told them

08:27.800 --> 08:30.166
to leave a scar.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.878
- He branded you.
- Mason wants you

08:33.910 --> 08:36.708
to know this can
never be undone.

08:36.750 --> 08:40.015
- Mason can be undone.

08:40.050 --> 08:42.883
- Not without taking everything
I have with him.

08:44.790 --> 08:48.681
He's all I've got now;
that's exactly what he wanted.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.952
He won.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.956
He always wins.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.822
- This won't
make you human, Margot,

08:58.870 --> 09:01.088
so much as give you the ability
to make yourself human

09:01.140 --> 09:03.108
and move on.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.608
- There's no resolve to this.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.006
There's no resolution.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.213
- Moving on isn't just
a distraction...

09:15.220 --> 09:19.111
...it's a rebuke.

09:19.150 --> 09:21.983
Show your brother
how strong you are.

09:26.060 --> 09:28.790
Survive him.

09:30.900 --> 09:33.937
- _Hannibal has
a certain personality style

09:33.970 --> 09:36.939
we can all learn from.

09:36.970 --> 09:38.938
In moderation of course.

09:38.970 --> 09:42.337
- All I want to do
is catch him.

09:42.380 --> 09:44.348
- He's given me nothing, Jack.

09:44.380 --> 09:46.917
Nothing actionable.
He has confessed to nothing.

09:46.950 --> 09:50.681
He's acknowledged only vagaries.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.211
- I need more than vagaries.
You have killed someone, Will.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.820
- Who was trying to kill me.
- I don't know if I can

09:55.860 --> 09:58.579
prove that.
You mutilated the body!

10:00.060 --> 10:02.961
We made a public spectacle
of Freddie Lounds's death.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.969
I'm out on a limb here,
and the limb is going to break!

10:06.000 --> 10:08.332
I've only told the OIG

10:08.370 --> 10:11.862
what they need to know.
Now, what haven't you told me?

10:16.440 --> 10:18.647
- Hannibal is trying
to manipulate me

10:18.680 --> 10:21.171
into murdering
one of his patients.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.188
Mason Verger.

10:23.220 --> 10:25.848
But I can manipulate Hannibal

10:25.890 --> 10:28.211
into killing him instead.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.285
- What's Verger done?

10:33.430 --> 10:36.922
- Hannibal considers him rude.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.894
It's motive enough.

10:39.940 --> 10:43.728
It's as though committing
murders has purged him

10:43.770 --> 10:45.704
of lesser rudeness.

10:45.740 --> 10:47.731
- We're talking about
putting a man's life in danger.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.748
- You know, sometimes, Jack,
a good plan

10:49.780 --> 10:51.873
is less about finding
the best alternative,

10:51.910 --> 10:53.878
than it is about
finding one that works.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.138
- Don't let empathy

10:56.180 --> 10:59.013
confuse what you want

10:59.050 --> 11:01.189
with what Lecter wants.

11:03.060 --> 11:06.427
- I told you, Jack,
I'm a good fisherman.

11:06.460 --> 11:09.293
We have to use
the right bait.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.423
When Hannibal tries
to kill Mason Verger,

11:11.470 --> 11:13.688
I'll arrest him,

11:13.740 --> 11:15.731
and you'll have 2 witnesses.

11:15.770 --> 11:17.909
- We might have 3.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.875
I'm a good fisherman too, Will.

12:19.430 --> 12:22.035
- They tell me
you were hard to find.

12:22.070 --> 12:25.301
- That was the idea.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.300
- Thank you...

12:31.350 --> 12:33.477
for visiting me
in the hospital,

12:33.520 --> 12:36.478
and,uh".

12:36.520 --> 12:38.488
for what you said.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.853
- I didn't say enough.

12:45.090 --> 12:47.251
- And now's your chance
to say it all.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.462
You've been granted
immunity from prosecution

12:53.500 --> 12:56.037
by the U.S. Attorney
from District 36,

12:56.070 --> 12:59.904
and by local authorities
in a memorandum attached, sworn

12:59.940 --> 13:01.874
and attested.

13:16.020 --> 13:18.386
Let's talk
about Hannibal Lecter.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.291
- Some psychiatrists

13:23.330 --> 13:25.594
are so hungry for insight

13:25.630 --> 13:27.894
that they may try

13:27.940 --> 13:30.909
to manufacture it.

13:32.910 --> 13:35.105
How deadly that can be
for the patient

13:35.140 --> 13:37.108
who believes them.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.278
- You were Dr. Lecter's
psychiatrist, he wasn't yours.

13:42.050 --> 13:44.018
- I told myself that,

13:44.050 --> 13:46.018
but I was

13:46.050 --> 13:48.154
under Hannibal's influence.

13:48.190 --> 13:50.226
And what he did to you

13:50.260 --> 13:53.252
made that abundantly clear.

13:55.630 --> 13:58.963
- You were attacked

13:59.000 --> 14:01.298
by a patient
who was formerly

14:01.340 --> 14:04.161
under Dr. Lecter's care.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.633
That patient died
during the attack.

14:06.670 --> 14:09.002
Report said
he swallowed his tongue.

14:10.680 --> 14:13.274
- It wasn't attached
at the time.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.514
- How...

14:19.550 --> 14:21.654
exactly...

14:21.690 --> 14:24.227
did your patient die?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.356
- I killed him.

14:40.540 --> 14:44.078
I believed
it was self-defence.

14:44.110 --> 14:48.342
And to a point, it was.

14:48.380 --> 14:52.146
but beyond that point,

14:52.190 --> 14:55.580
it was murder.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.551
Hannibal influenced me

14:59.590 --> 15:01.626
to murder my patient,

15:01.660 --> 15:05.096
our patient.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.591
- You weren't...

15:09.640 --> 15:11.608
coerced?

15:11.640 --> 15:13.574
- What Hannibal does

15:13.610 --> 15:15.601
is not coercion...

15:17.610 --> 15:20.078
...it is persuasion.

15:23.650 --> 15:26.585
Has he ever tried
to persuade you

15:26.620 --> 15:28.679
to kill anybody?

15:32.130 --> 15:35.952
He will.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.423
And it will be
somebody you love.

15:40.440 --> 15:45.230
And you will think
it's the only choice you have.

15:51.050 --> 15:55.077
- How would you catch him?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.247
- Hannibal can get lost...

15:59.250 --> 16:01.252
...in self-congratulation

16:01.290 --> 16:03.258
at his own

16:03.290 --> 16:07.158
exquisite taste
and cunning.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.124
Whimsy.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.630
That will be
how he will get caught.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.280
- We're maintaining our position

16:30.320 --> 16:32.311
on the event horizon of chaos.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.187
- Your veneer _
of self-composure gives

16:37.230 --> 16:40.199
a strong sense
of the surreal.

16:43.770 --> 16:47.069
So much about this
feels like a dream.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.504
- Dreams prepare us
for waking life.

16:53.510 --> 16:56.479
- It's one thing to dream;
it's another to...

16:56.510 --> 16:58.603
understand the nature
of the dream.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.339
- You're waking up to who
you are. That's all you
need to understand.

17:11.790 --> 17:15.692
There are extraordinary
circumstances here, Will.

17:15.730 --> 17:18.597
And unusual opportunities.

17:18.630 --> 17:21.428
- For whom?

17:21.470 --> 17:23.438
- For both of us.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.768
- Mason Verger
is an opportunity?

17:27.680 --> 17:30.399
- Mason Verger is a problem.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.510
Problem solving is hunting.

17:33.550 --> 17:35.575
It's a savage pleasure,

17:35.620 --> 17:37.645
and we are born to it.

17:37.690 --> 17:41.558
A pleasure we can share.

17:46.790 --> 17:49.725
- You're fostering codependency.

17:52.630 --> 17:56.566
- Is that what I'm doing?

17:58.440 --> 18:00.431
- Isn't that what
you did to Abigail?

18:02.310 --> 18:06.849
Got her to take a life
so she would owe you hers?

18:15.290 --> 18:18.282
I bond with Abigail;

18:18.330 --> 18:20.491
you take her away.

18:20.530 --> 18:23.567
I bond with...

18:23.600 --> 18:25.568
barely more than
the idea of a child;

18:25.600 --> 18:29.229
you take it away.
You saw to it that

18:29.270 --> 18:32.433
I alienated Alana,

18:32.470 --> 18:35.177
alienated Jack.

18:37.680 --> 18:41.275
You don't want me
to have anything in my life

18:41.320 --> 18:44.687
that's not you.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.280
- I only want
what's best for you.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.619
- Please.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.855
Every moment

18:52.890 --> 18:55.427
ofcogentthought
under your psychiatric care

18:55.460 --> 18:57.894
is a personal victory.

19:00.940 --> 19:04.933
- You're applying yourself
to my perspective...

19:04.970 --> 19:08.371
as I've been applying
myself to yours.

19:11.850 --> 19:15.741
- You're right.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.248
We are just alike.

19:20.920 --> 19:24.879
You're as alone as I am.

19:24.930 --> 19:28.229
And we're both alone

19:28.260 --> 19:30.296
without each other.

19:37.940 --> 19:41.205
- So you managed
to avoid prosecution.

19:50.550 --> 19:52.916
I gave you every opportunity
to tell the truth,

19:52.950 --> 19:54.918
but you ran.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.985
- How do you think

19:57.020 --> 20:00.353
the FBI could have
protected me?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.652
You couldn't protect
Will Graham.

20:02.700 --> 20:05.396
You still can't.

20:05.430 --> 20:08.866
Nothing makes us more vulnerable
than loneliness, Agent Crawford.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.266
- Will's not alone.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.733
- No, he's not.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.808
Hannibal thinks
Will is a killer.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.813
Do you still believe
he is your killer?

20:24.850 --> 20:28.286
- I have to believe.

20:28.320 --> 20:31.551
- Hannibal's only crime
I witnessed

20:31.590 --> 20:34.297
was influence.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.423
Influence works best

20:36.460 --> 20:38.428
when we're unaware.

20:38.470 --> 20:41.439
Will Graham

20:41.470 --> 20:43.358
has been very aware.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.366
- Meaning?

20:45.410 --> 20:49.039
- Meaning maybe Mr. Graham
doesn't know himself

20:49.080 --> 20:51.708
as well as Hannibal does.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.048
- Will has more reasons

20:54.080 --> 20:57.584
to see Hannibal caught
than any of us.

20:57.620 --> 21:00.953
- If you think
you're about to catch Hannibal,

21:00.990 --> 21:03.254
that's because he wants you
to think that.

21:05.060 --> 21:07.722
Don't fool yourself
into thinking

21:07.760 --> 21:11.628
he's not in control
of what's happening.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.506
(classical music)

22:05.850 --> 22:08.455
- Kholodets.

22:08.490 --> 22:11.687
A Ukrainian dish whose outcome
can never be predicted.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.491
Hmm.

22:19.530 --> 22:21.532
The Latin word gelatus

22:21.570 --> 22:23.435
translates as "frozen."

22:23.470 --> 22:25.438
Here, the aspic

22:25.470 --> 22:27.438
provides
a three-dimensional canvas

22:27.480 --> 22:29.402
in which one may stage a scene.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.579
- The eternal chase.

22:31.610 --> 22:33.578
- An evocative shape

22:33.620 --> 22:35.838
in that at a certain point,
it becomes unclear

22:35.880 --> 22:37.848
who's pursuing whom.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.846
(small laugh)

22:39.890 --> 22:43.656
- Well, in isolation,
a moment can't really

22:43.690 --> 22:46.056
speak to motive,
intent or aftermath.

22:46.090 --> 22:49.594
- Aspic is derived from bone...

22:49.630 --> 22:51.461
as a life is made from moments.

22:51.500 --> 22:55.869
- So, tell me,
Hannibal, what, uh...

22:55.900 --> 22:59.131
what moment are we in now?

22:59.170 --> 23:02.970
You, me, Will?

23:03.010 --> 23:06.776
- Still harbouring
doubts about Will?

23:09.450 --> 23:12.681
- Alana Bloom isn't
harbouring any doubts.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.984
She's convinced
that he murdered Freddie Lounds.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.988
- And you?

23:19.030 --> 23:20.998
- I am convinced

23:21.030 --> 23:23.828
of my general lack of trust
in other people.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.168
- Lack of trust
in other people

23:26.200 --> 23:28.839
increases the need
for religion.

23:28.870 --> 23:31.134
If you can't rely on others,

23:31.170 --> 23:33.775
you have to rely on God.

23:33.810 --> 23:36.028
-Hmm.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.048
I'm relying on myself.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.514
And yet in this moment,

23:40.550 --> 23:42.541
I have to confess that...

23:44.550 --> 23:46.518
...I don't know
who's pursuing whom

23:46.550 --> 23:50.156
any more than these fish do.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.197
- Whomever is pursuing whom
in this very moment,

23:55.230 --> 23:57.118
I intend to eat them.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.060
(Jack snickers.)

23:59.100 --> 24:01.660
-Mmm.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.190
(sinister piano music)

24:36.270 --> 24:38.864
- Hi, guys. Eat up.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.662
(woman singing Italian opera)

25:20.650 --> 25:22.572
(door opening)

25:28.660 --> 25:32.756
- Buongiorno, Dottore.

25:32.790 --> 25:36.226
- Buongiorno.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.899
(soft creaking)
- Mr. Verger wants your company.

25:38.930 --> 25:41.637
Please, come with us.

25:41.670 --> 25:45.060
- Preferirei di no.

25:45.110 --> 25:46.532
- Argh!

25:47.910 --> 25:49.707
- Ah!

25:49.740 --> 25:51.549
- Ugh!

25:53.310 --> 25:56.814
(moaning in pain)
- Matteo.

26:00.150 --> 26:02.209
- He shouldn't
have done that.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.249
Buona sera...

26:34.290 --> 26:36.281
Dottore.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.823
- You are Sardinian.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.999
If you have to be
kidnapped for ransom,

26:44.030 --> 26:46.123
a wealthy Italian will tell you

26:46.170 --> 26:49.333
it's better to fall
into the hands of the Sards.

26:51.770 --> 26:54.000
And you're a professional
revenger as well, I suspect.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.270
- With you...

26:56.310 --> 26:58.301
it is personal now.

27:01.720 --> 27:05.019
- I take it Matteo
didn't make it.

27:05.050 --> 27:07.018
Did he foul himself?

27:07.050 --> 27:10.281
I imagine he smells worse
than you by now.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.686
- Kill him

27:12.730 --> 27:15.119
and you will get
no money! Carlo!

27:15.160 --> 27:16.923
Carlo!

27:31.350 --> 27:34.842
Ha!Ha!Ho!Ho!

27:34.880 --> 27:36.177
Those little piggies
are gonna go

27:36.220 --> 27:39.883
EEE-EEE-EEE-EEE
all the way home.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.889
Haha! Yes!

27:42.920 --> 27:46.048
The swine may be shy

27:46.090 --> 27:49.150
with starting with the toes
so we need to encourage them

27:49.200 --> 27:52.692
with a-little-sauce, huh?

27:54.240 --> 27:57.038
So we're gonna
cut your throat.

27:57.070 --> 27:59.038
- Padrone,

27:59.070 --> 28:01.937
he killed Matteo.
- We can give

28:01.980 --> 28:03.948
Matteo's family

28:03.980 --> 28:06.346
Dottoroni's cojones,

28:06.380 --> 28:08.348
for comfort.

28:08.380 --> 28:10.314
Capisce?

28:14.390 --> 28:16.950
- (Hannibal):
He likes to cut low.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.497
- You are an odd psychiatrist.

28:24.530 --> 28:27.988
We could've had some good,
funny times together.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.968
It's a damn shame!

28:33.980 --> 28:35.936
I've muzzled the dog;

28:35.980 --> 28:39.302
now, it's time for you
to put him down.

28:49.420 --> 28:52.059
Don't bleed him out!
Just... just a little nick.

28:52.090 --> 28:55.025
Just enough to give
the pigs a taste.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.166
Carlo!

30:04.900 --> 30:06.993
(pigs grunting and squealing)

31:03.360 --> 31:06.284
(Mason laughing)

31:12.030 --> 31:13.998
- (with distorted voice): Mason,
I must ask you to be quiet.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.531
- Oh, shhh...
- You'll frighten the animals.

31:16.570 --> 31:19.232
P'ggy, p'ggY-

31:19.270 --> 31:22.330
piggy, piggy-
Here, piggy, piggy-

31:22.380 --> 31:24.348
Ha! Ha! What?

31:24.380 --> 31:26.507
Ha!Ha!Ha!Ha!

31:26.550 --> 31:30.111
What have you given me?
Ha!Ha!Ha!

31:30.150 --> 31:32.983
- (with distorted voice):
A variety of psychedelic
compounds.

31:33.020 --> 31:36.615
"Psychedelic" so named
from the Greek

31:36.660 --> 31:38.924
for "m'
ind-
reveaHng"

31:40.660 --> 31:44.960
- You need to write me
a prescription for this, Doctor.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.299
(laughing)

31:50.000 --> 31:51.536
Ha!Ha!Ha!Ha!

31:51.570 --> 31:54.209
- Patients rhapsodize
about the life-changing insights

31:54.240 --> 31:57.175
they achieve.
- I am enchanted

31:57.210 --> 31:59.405
and terrified.

31:59.450 --> 32:02.044
(indistinct talking)

32:04.050 --> 32:06.211
- The world presents itself

32:06.250 --> 32:09.651
as a cacophony of sights,
sounds, smells,

32:09.690 --> 32:12.659
recollections.

32:12.690 --> 32:15.420
I want you to recall
your education

32:15.460 --> 32:18.020
in stockyards
and slaughterhouses.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.668
Show me how Papa would check

32:21.700 --> 32:24.464
the depth of a pig's fat.

32:26.740 --> 32:29.300
(laughing)

32:29.340 --> 32:31.399
- Here, piggy, piggy, piggy-

32:31.450 --> 32:32.701
- No, Mason.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.945
No.

32:36.750 --> 32:39.184
Show me on you.

32:39.220 --> 32:43.008
(laughing)

32:57.240 --> 32:59.299
- Hey, Winston.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.371
Where's everyone else?

33:25.800 --> 33:28.735
- I just love

33:28.770 --> 33:31.466
your dogs.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.172
How is that? Is that good?
Do you want another piece?

33:34.210 --> 33:36.701
How about you?
That's a good girl.

33:36.740 --> 33:40.346
Sit! Sit!
- Mason?

33:40.380 --> 33:43.315
- I adopted some dogs
from the shelter,

33:43.350 --> 33:45.238
2 dogs that were friends.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.246
I had them
in a cage together

33:47.290 --> 33:49.781
with no food and fresh water.

33:49.820 --> 33:53.358
One of them died hungry.

33:53.390 --> 33:57.121
The other had a warm meal.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.628
I should have put you

33:59.670 --> 34:01.661
in a cage with Dr. Lecter.

34:01.700 --> 34:05.534
I'm curious
what would've happened.

34:05.570 --> 34:08.630
- What are you feeding my dogs?

34:11.810 --> 34:16.179
- Ha! Just me.
(laughing maniacally)

34:21.860 --> 34:24.055
Sit! Sit.

34:36.370 --> 34:39.601
- What Mason is experiencing
isn't restricted

34:39.640 --> 34:42.677
to reality, so...

34:42.710 --> 34:45.577
reality has to be forced
to adapt.

34:45.610 --> 34:47.749
- He fed his face to my dogs.

34:47.780 --> 34:50.169
- He broadened their palates

34:50.220 --> 34:52.211
as I broadened yours.

34:56.590 --> 34:58.581
Murder or mercy?

35:01.900 --> 35:04.494
- There is no mercy.

35:04.530 --> 35:07.624
We make mercy...

35:07.670 --> 35:11.367
manufacture it in the parts
that have overgrown

35:11.410 --> 35:15.198
our basic reptile brain.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.300
- Then there is no murder.
We make murder too.

35:18.350 --> 35:21.649
It matters only to us.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.649
You know too well
you possess all the elements

35:24.690 --> 35:26.908
to make murder.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.918
Perhaps mercy too, but murder

35:28.960 --> 35:31.258
you understand
uncomfortably well.

35:31.290 --> 35:33.155
- I'm hungry!

35:34.830 --> 35:36.798
- Eat your nose then.

35:36.830 --> 35:40.391
- Eat my...

35:40.430 --> 35:42.534
eat my nose?

35:58.920 --> 36:00.888
I have a taste

36:00.920 --> 36:04.549
and consistency
that's similar

36:04.590 --> 36:06.785
to that of a chicken gizzard.

36:06.830 --> 36:08.798
_ - Taste is housed
in parts of the mind

36:08.830 --> 36:12.459
that precedes pity.
Pity has no place at the table.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.298
(Mason burps.)
- I'm full of myself.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.967
(laughing)

36:17.000 --> 36:19.468
- I'm not gonna kill him.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.501
- So full of myself.

36:21.540 --> 36:25.704
- He was going
to feed you to his pigs...

36:25.750 --> 36:27.775
after he fed them me.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.812
Weren't you, Mason?

36:31.820 --> 36:33.617
- I was.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.779
- He's your patient, Doctor.

36:39.790 --> 36:42.725
You do what you think
is best for him.

36:42.760 --> 36:44.762
(Mason humming softly)

37:20.400 --> 37:22.493
(mechanical ventilation)

37:27.340 --> 37:30.901
- Good afternoon.
Agent Crawford?

37:30.940 --> 37:33.306
- Yes. Good afternoon,
Mr. Verger.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.045
What a magnificent creature.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.048
- Oh, thank you.

37:40.090 --> 37:43.548
It's a muraena kidako.

37:43.590 --> 37:46.650
Its common name
is "brutal moray."

37:52.730 --> 37:55.392
- No, thank you.

37:55.440 --> 37:59.035
I don't want to take up too much
of your time, Mr. Verger.

37:59.070 --> 38:02.506
I realize that you probably need
to get your rest.

38:02.540 --> 38:05.304
But I would like to ask you

38:05.350 --> 38:07.910
just a few questions about

38:07.950 --> 38:10.009
what happened to you.

38:10.050 --> 38:12.348
- Took a tumble in the pig pen.

38:12.390 --> 38:14.381
Broke my neck.

38:14.420 --> 38:16.559
Embarrassing, really.

38:16.590 --> 38:19.525
Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.

38:19.560 --> 38:21.494
If my sister hadn't found me,

38:21.530 --> 38:24.090
the pigs would have eaten
more than my face.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.428
- Pigs did this to you.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.097
- Oh yes,

38:28.130 --> 38:30.462
the pigs certainly did.

38:34.610 --> 38:36.601
- Mr. Verger, you are a patient

38:36.640 --> 38:39.643
of Dr. Hannibal Lecter,
isn't that right?

38:39.680 --> 38:42.843
- Dr. Lecter, yes, yes.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.587
- Have you ever seen or met

38:45.620 --> 38:48.555
another patient of Dr. Lecter's,
a man called Will Graham?

38:48.590 --> 38:51.388
- Will Graham...

38:51.430 --> 38:54.854
The man that didn't kill

38:54.900 --> 38:56.959
all those people.
That Will Graham?

38:57.000 --> 38:58.399
- Yes.

38:58.430 --> 39:01.399
- Can't say that
I've had the pleasure.

39:01.440 --> 39:05.137
- Do you find that Dr. Lecter's
therapy has been helpful to you?

39:05.170 --> 39:08.606
- I've benefited greatly
from Dr. Lecter's therapy.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.801
I'm still benefitting from it.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.842
I will always be grateful

39:12.880 --> 39:15.019
for how he's helped me.

39:15.050 --> 39:18.611
I only hope
that I may repay him one day.

39:24.790 --> 39:26.951
Now, if you don't mind,

39:26.990 --> 39:28.992
I am rather tired.

39:29.030 --> 39:33.399
- Thank you for your time,
Mr. Verger.

39:51.150 --> 39:55.758
- Is it time to talk
about what Margot wants?

39:55.790 --> 39:58.725
What Margot wants is

39:58.760 --> 40:03.151
to take care of you,
Mason, dear.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.419
Just as you took care of me.

40:21.850 --> 40:25.445
- Achilles lamenting
the death of Patroclus.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.518
Whenever he's mentioned
in The Iliad,

40:29.560 --> 40:32.882
Patroclus seems to be defined
by his empathy.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.455
- He became Achilles

40:35.500 --> 40:37.491
on the field of war.

40:37.530 --> 40:40.465
He died for him there,
wearing his armor.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.094
- He did.

40:43.140 --> 40:45.802
Hiding and revealing identity

40:45.840 --> 40:48.161
is a constant theme _
throughout the Greek epics.

40:48.210 --> 40:52.203
- As are
battle-tested friendships.

40:54.280 --> 40:57.249
- Achilles wished
all Greeks would die,

40:57.280 --> 40:59.248
so that he and Patroclus

40:59.290 --> 41:01.554
could conquer Troy alone.

41:04.560 --> 41:07.723
Took divine intervention
to bring them down.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.161
- This isn't sustainable.

41:18.570 --> 41:20.800
We're going to get caught.

41:26.150 --> 41:29.278
- Jack already suspects
you killed Freddie Lounds.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.584
- If Jack told you
he suspects me,

41:31.620 --> 41:34.248
that means he suspects you.
- I know.

41:40.330 --> 41:43.049
- You should give him
what he wants.

41:45.900 --> 41:49.199
- Give him
the Chesapeake Ripper?

41:51.810 --> 41:53.801
- Allow him closure.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.699
Reveal yourself.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.742
You've taunted him
for long enough.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.646
Let him see you

42:06.690 --> 42:09.215
with clear eyes.

42:11.220 --> 42:13.984
- Jack has become my friend.

42:16.730 --> 42:19.961
I suppose I owe him the truth.

42:31.380 --> 42:34.144
