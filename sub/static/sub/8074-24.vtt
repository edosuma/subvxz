[harmonica motif]

00:09.977 --> 00:12.113
Darlene, is there more juice?

00:12.146 --> 00:14.482
Yeah, but it's frozen.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.084
And it's on a stick.

00:20.221 --> 00:23.857
All right, who's freezing bees?

00:23.891 --> 00:25.626
I am.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.095
Quick question, freak boy.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.429
Why?

00:28.462 --> 00:33.067
So I could thaw them out.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.936
Didn't they come thawed out?

00:35.969 --> 00:37.971
Yeah, but see, if
you freeze a bee,

00:38.005 --> 00:40.074
then use a magnifying
glass to thaw it out,

00:40.108 --> 00:42.876
it'll come back to life.

00:42.910 --> 00:43.844
Is that really true?

00:43.877 --> 00:45.079
I don't know.

00:45.113 --> 00:48.282
He was wrong about that
nail through the worm thing.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.350
It's true.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.018
Just thaw them out
and they fly away.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.322
Oh, come on, DJ,
that's impossible.

00:54.355 --> 00:55.456
No, it's not.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.724
Come on I'll show you.

00:56.757 --> 01:00.194
[chuckling] God, he's actually
going to unfreeze a bee.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.695
DJ Is going to take
something that's dead

01:01.729 --> 01:02.696
and bring it back to life.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.133
That's like playing God.

01:05.166 --> 01:09.970
I'm sure God was thrilled
by that comparison.

01:10.003 --> 01:14.808
Ooh, nice, we haven't
cooked out in a long time.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.043
It just takes a minute.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.578
I feel like there ought
to be spooky music playing.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.380
[jackie imitates spooky music]

01:20.381 --> 01:25.085
Please, please
be a killer bee.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.787
Why don't you just zap
it in the microwave?

01:26.820 --> 01:27.988
Tried that, blew up.

01:30.891 --> 01:31.759
What are you doing?

01:31.792 --> 01:33.494
Bringing a bee back to life.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.197
OK.

01:36.230 --> 01:39.200
You know, Deej, bees are
really intelligent creatures,

01:39.233 --> 01:40.668
and they're amazingly devoted.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.203
I read someplace
where if you kill one,

01:42.236 --> 01:45.306
then the whole hive comes and
finds your scent and kills you.

01:45.339 --> 01:48.008
Actually, his scent
tends to kill them.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.143
See, see--

01:49.177 --> 01:50.811
Oh, my God, Darlene,
look it's a miracle!

01:50.844 --> 01:53.046
The bee's alive!

01:53.080 --> 01:56.016
Truly he is the son of God.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.585
See, I told you I could do it!

01:57.618 --> 01:59.387
Look, he's getting
ready to take off.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.389
There he goes!

02:01.422 --> 02:02.323
[whack]

02:11.832 --> 02:14.602
Now if you bring that one
back, I'll be real impressed.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.004
[bluesy harmonica theme music]

03:13.927 --> 03:15.496
So you guys want a toe tag?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.468
When I started watching
the trial, I was certain.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.469
And now I'm not sure.

03:24.372 --> 03:27.040
Well, there's no doubt
in my mind, Jackie.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.709
F. Lee Bailey's
definitely drunk.

03:32.413 --> 03:36.149
Has bored to death
ever actually happened?

03:36.183 --> 03:38.719
Don't pretend like you're
not into it, Darlene.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.688
Why else did you go get
that Marcia Clark haircut?

03:48.095 --> 03:50.063
Well, Jackie, if you
can tear yourself away,

03:50.097 --> 03:51.365
you want to go see
a movie with me?

03:51.399 --> 03:53.334
No way, I've followed
this from the beginning,

03:53.367 --> 03:54.968
I know the second I
leave it's finally going

03:55.002 --> 03:57.471
to start getting interesting.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.307
All right, Mom,
I'll go with you.

03:59.340 --> 04:03.511
But this time, I pay and
let you in the exit door.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.645
No.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.280
Going would just mean
having to take a shower

04:06.314 --> 04:08.716
and put on underwear.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.851
Go ask David.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.687
Nah, too much history
there, it would be weird.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.088
You live for weird.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.391
Darlene, go with David.

04:17.425 --> 04:21.094
My biggest regret is I lost
touch with the guys I dated.

04:24.131 --> 04:28.536
Doesn't the, uh, health
department keep them records?

04:28.569 --> 04:30.338
I just don't think
David and I can

04:30.371 --> 04:32.306
have a friendly relationship.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.008
Well, then, you know, you're
throwing away something good.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.910
Because I always stayed
friends with all the men

04:36.944 --> 04:40.147
I was with after
the sex stopped.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.583
Your father, for example.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.385
Well, I'd like to
be friends with him,

04:44.418 --> 04:45.953
but I just don't know
that it's possible.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.588
Anything is possible, Darlene.

04:47.621 --> 04:53.494
For example, last week, I, by
myself, refilled the ice trays.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.262
Roseanne, lighten up.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.998
She's got to be comfortable
with it, take your time.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.601
Many people have tried to
push me into doing things I--

05:00.634 --> 05:01.969
[yelling] David!

05:02.002 --> 05:04.738
On the other hand, Darlene,
you're not getting any younger.

05:04.772 --> 05:05.639
What's going on?

05:05.673 --> 05:07.107
Oh, sidebar, huh?

05:10.878 --> 05:12.346
Hey, David.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.213
Hey.

05:16.484 --> 05:20.187
You want to--
go to a movie?

05:20.220 --> 05:23.624
Don't you think that would
be a little uncomfortable?

05:23.657 --> 05:28.128
Could you two drama
queens just get over it?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.897
Do you have any
feelings left for David?

05:29.930 --> 05:31.064
No.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.733
And do you have any
feelings left for Darlene?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.234
Well, I respect
her as a person--

05:34.267 --> 05:36.970
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.305
OK, so it's just a movie.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.908
You can go, it
doesn't mean nothing.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.744
If it's OK with
you, it's OK with me.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.379
OK, let's go.

05:45.413 --> 05:49.883
Now, remember-- no
expectations, no attachments.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.419
Just a couple of
buddies hanging out.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.255
They're going to
get back together.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.795
I'm so amazing.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.164
If I ever get up off this
couch, I'll be unstoppable.

[harmonica motif]

06:12.906 --> 06:15.208
I didn't know we
were having waffles.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.377
Well, that's life in
the Conner household,

06:17.411 --> 06:22.049
one unexpected
surprise after another.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.619
So you and David got in
pretty late last night, huh?

06:25.653 --> 06:27.421
You waited up for me?

06:27.455 --> 06:29.590
No, I didn't wait up for
you, I waited up for David.

06:29.623 --> 06:34.995
In case you didn't know, he
scrapes my feet at night.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.164
So where'd you go
after the movie?

06:37.197 --> 06:39.099
We got a bite to eat.

06:39.132 --> 06:42.035
And?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.704
And he had a burger.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.738
Yeah?

06:44.772 --> 06:46.640
It was a little dry.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.241
Oh, spill it, Darlene.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.010
Don't think of me
as being your mom,

06:50.043 --> 06:53.113
think of me as like one of
your girlfriends at school.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.281
Well, in that
case, I should tell

06:54.314 --> 06:55.382
you that all the
other girls always

06:55.415 --> 06:56.216
make fun of your clothes.

06:59.152 --> 07:02.222
Spill it, Darlene, or I'm
going to make you go with me

07:02.255 --> 07:05.459
to see the movie "Nell."

07:05.493 --> 07:08.161
All right, David
and I had a good time.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.763
And I'll deny saying
this later, but I'm

07:09.797 --> 07:10.864
glad you got us to go out.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.237
That's it?

07:17.270 --> 07:19.206
Yeah, I mean, it was just
real comfortable and natural,

07:19.239 --> 07:20.307
you know.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.542
It's like the guys I
go out with at school,

07:21.575 --> 07:23.076
they always try to say
something really witty,

07:23.110 --> 07:25.779
and then they expect me
to applaud or something.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.481
Yeah, your dad
looks at me that way

07:27.515 --> 07:29.783
whenever he picks the right
vowel on Wheel of Fortune.

07:32.553 --> 07:36.023
You know, I've kind of got
the feeling that David might

07:36.056 --> 07:37.190
want to get back together.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.091
Really?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.227
What about you?

07:40.260 --> 07:43.263
Well, I wouldn't mind
getting back together, either.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.665
I think that's great, Darlene.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.233
I'm really happy for you.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.367
Thanks, Mom.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.469
And thanks for butting in.

07:49.503 --> 07:52.405
Yeah, well this time I
hope you guys stay together,

07:52.439 --> 07:53.974
because, you know, this
is getting tough on me.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.043
Next time I'm just
going to use duct tape.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.410
Morning.

07:57.444 --> 07:58.345
Hi.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.246
Hey.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.514
No, no, no,
don't hang that up.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.515
I'm expecting a call.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.623
You know, David,
if you're not busy

08:09.657 --> 08:15.228
tonight, I'm really in
the mood for some Yahtzee.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.964
I was kind of hoping
on going out tonight.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.198
Oh, really?

08:18.231 --> 08:22.035
What, you and Darlene going
to go see another movie?

08:22.069 --> 08:23.436
Yeah, why don't we?

08:23.470 --> 08:24.471
No, actually, I have a date.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.679
Well, David, a date is an
easy thing to break, you know?

08:34.414 --> 08:37.384
I can do it for you.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.419
Be fun.

08:39.452 --> 08:40.588
What's the little bitch's name?

08:46.493 --> 08:47.494
I am not breaking this date.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.596
I've been trying
to get this girl

08:48.629 --> 08:50.931
to go out with me for months.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.566
Well, that's cool.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.535
I got to study, anyway.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.270
Mrs. Conner, could you
recommend a good restaurant

08:57.304 --> 08:58.171
I can take my date to?

08:58.205 --> 08:59.339
I'm not your pimp, David.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.851
Whoa!

09:10.884 --> 09:15.856
That smells-- well, it doesn't
smell good, but it sure is big.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.157
Just the way you like it.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.727
What's in there, anyway?

09:19.760 --> 09:23.530
Meat, vegetables,
cheese, fruit--

09:23.563 --> 09:24.698
I don't know.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.299
Something wrong, honey?

09:29.336 --> 09:31.639
Darline still loves David, OK.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.373
So I got them to go to
this movie together.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.142
Now David has got a date
with some other girl,

09:35.175 --> 09:36.677
and Darlene's
really, really upset.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.445
I feel like it's
kind of my fault,

09:38.478 --> 09:40.714
and I don't know
what to do about it.

09:40.748 --> 09:44.284
Well, call me
when dinner's ready.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.655
If you leave this room
now, you're having seconds.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.157
Why do you always need me to
tell you not to get involved

09:50.190 --> 09:51.524
right before you get involved?

09:51.558 --> 09:52.693
Does it help psych you up?

09:52.726 --> 09:53.961
Does it make it extra fun?

09:53.994 --> 09:56.163
Oh, so I shouldn't
get involved.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.698
I should just leave it
up to God, whether they

09:57.731 --> 09:58.799
get back together or not?

09:58.832 --> 09:59.700
Yeah.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.835
But he has so much, Dan.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.303
And all I have is
this kind of thing-- .

10:03.336 --> 10:04.137
and the diner.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.409
Did you ever think that
maybe it would be better

10:09.442 --> 10:11.144
if they didn't get together?

10:11.178 --> 10:12.946
I mean, David's doing
great, and Darlene's

10:12.980 --> 10:14.314
doing big things in Chicago.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.416
Maybe she shouldn't be tied
down to someone here in Lanford.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.519
Yeah, well maybe I
shouldn't be, either.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.755
Why are you so intent
on getting them together?

10:21.789 --> 10:24.524
'Cause I love my
daughter and I love David.

10:24.557 --> 10:25.392
No new people!

10:28.061 --> 10:29.763
Look, I hate to say
this, but if David

10:29.797 --> 10:31.231
is dating other
people, he's probably

10:31.264 --> 10:32.933
not interested in Darlene.

10:32.966 --> 10:33.834
Oh, yeah?

10:33.867 --> 10:34.735
David come in here!

10:34.768 --> 10:36.704
What are you doing?

10:36.737 --> 10:38.872
I'm going to find out
whether he loves her or not.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.408
And if he does then I'm going
to make them get back together.

10:41.441 --> 10:42.309
And if he doesn't?

10:42.342 --> 10:43.210
Hey.

10:50.650 --> 10:55.555
So David, this girl you're
going out with tonight,

10:55.588 --> 10:57.057
you like her?

10:57.090 --> 10:58.091
Yes.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.360
That's nice.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.863
You like her more
than you like--

11:02.896 --> 11:03.697
say, me?

11:06.399 --> 11:10.237
Just answer the question, son.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.773
That's not really
a fair comparison.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.674
That's a good point.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.077
What would be a fair comparison?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.411
Oh, I know!

11:18.445 --> 11:21.815
Do you like her more
than you like Darlene?

11:21.849 --> 11:24.017
I don't know.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.485
Is that a painful subject?

11:25.518 --> 11:26.820
Sort of.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.288
Why, David, because
you think maybe

11:28.321 --> 11:30.991
there's a lot of
unfinished business?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.159
What are you getting at?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.894
Nothing, I'm just talking
about your new girl.

11:33.927 --> 11:34.995
No, no you're not.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.897
You're talking about Darlene.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.166
See, I wonder why you
keep bringing her up?

11:39.199 --> 11:40.734
I don't.

11:40.768 --> 11:43.403
Hey, it's OK if you don't
want to talk about this, David,

11:43.436 --> 11:44.805
but you really don't
have to start playing

11:44.838 --> 11:47.574
all these head games with me.

11:47.607 --> 11:50.944
OK, I see what
this is about now.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.046
Look, if Darlene thinks I
want to get back together

11:53.080 --> 11:54.447
with her or something, I don't.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.483
God, we broke up
almost a year ago.

11:56.516 --> 11:57.317
I'm over it now.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.089
See, I told you.
He loves her.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.957
Where'd you get that from?

12:03.991 --> 12:05.658
Well, it's so obvious.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.560
Didn't you see the big,
moony look on his face

12:07.594 --> 12:08.796
when he's talking about her?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.463
That's the same look
you get every year

12:10.497 --> 12:12.132
when the McRib comes back.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.068
[blues saxophone music]

12:25.112 --> 12:26.179
Big date tonight, huh?

12:32.652 --> 12:34.754
Are you wearing cologne?

12:34.788 --> 12:35.989
No, I just ate a cough drop.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.496
So I had fun last night.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.866
Yeah, I love crappy
movies like that.

12:45.899 --> 12:49.803
Yeah, me too.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.504
And dinner afterwards was fun.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.605
Yeah, I liked my burger.

12:56.743 --> 12:57.845
Wow.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.512
Meat is some crazy stuff, huh?

13:02.182 --> 13:03.917
What's going on, Darlene?

13:03.951 --> 13:06.286
Nothing, I just--

13:06.319 --> 13:10.323
well, I suppose that if I
had something to tell you

13:10.357 --> 13:14.227
and it was really
important, that now would

13:14.261 --> 13:15.963
probably be the right time.

13:15.996 --> 13:16.864
Yeah.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.334
No, nothing.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.836
I guess I should
have [claps] been

13:22.870 --> 13:26.006
more creative with my time.

13:26.039 --> 13:29.476
You know, when I take
my spine to the shop,

13:29.509 --> 13:31.845
I always get a loner.

13:31.879 --> 13:34.414
Look, I just changed
my mind, all right?

13:34.447 --> 13:36.216
Oh, that's such bull, Darlene.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.517
You know you love him.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.519
So go in there,
take a deep breath,

13:39.552 --> 13:41.288
and say all those things
to him that you used to say

13:41.321 --> 13:45.092
to that Scott Baio poster.

13:45.125 --> 13:45.993
OK, you're right.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.494
David's all I ever think about.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.761
I can't stand being apart.

13:48.795 --> 13:49.662
Damn!

13:49.696 --> 13:53.066
This lousy war!

13:53.100 --> 13:56.536
Well, he likes you.

13:56.569 --> 13:57.437
He does?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.206
How do you know?

13:59.239 --> 14:03.576
Because posing as a person
who cares for him and feeds him,

14:03.610 --> 14:06.479
I slowly earned his trust.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.448
And he said he still likes me?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.717
Yeah, well he didn't
exactly use those words,

14:10.750 --> 14:11.952
but, you know, he
was all fidgety,

14:11.985 --> 14:13.120
and he couldn't
look me in the eye.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.755
So he might as well
have said it like that.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.991
What exactly did he say?

14:18.025 --> 14:21.128
That he didn't like you.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.263
Well, gosh, I guess I'd
better go back on the pill.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.499
No trust me, trust
me on this, Darlene.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.868
The guy is nuts about you, but
he's not going to tell you.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.003
You're the one
who's going to have

14:30.037 --> 14:31.972
to stick her neck out here.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.173
Why me?

14:33.206 --> 14:37.110
Because he's a guy,
see, and guys can't talk

14:37.144 --> 14:38.478
about their feelings that much.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.081
You know, that part of their
brain is totally undeveloped.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.816
There's just mostly like a
big pocket of fat in there

14:43.850 --> 14:47.754
to keep the head from
laying over to one side.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.923
Well, I can't
tell him, either.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.859
Yeah, you can, you can tell
him you like him, Darlene.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.727
Or you can do what
your dad did to me.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.564
Punch him in the
arm and run away.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.398
No.

15:01.101 --> 15:04.104
You're scared.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.505
I don't believe it.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.874
Here I thought you were a big,
strong, brave woman that could

15:07.907 --> 15:09.809
handle anything, and
you're sitting here

15:09.842 --> 15:18.185
scared to death
of little Kenny G.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.252
That's not it.

15:19.286 --> 15:24.857
It's just, well,
I know that David

15:24.891 --> 15:26.026
is the one that I really want.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.998
Well, I wanted the
Buy 'N' Bag to carry

15:31.031 --> 15:37.070
those foot-long hot dogs,
Darlene, but I never spoke up.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.739
The result-- unhappiness.

15:42.375 --> 15:46.579
I've dated a lot of guys
at school and they all suck.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.852
If I go in there
and he rejects me,

15:52.885 --> 15:54.754
I just don't think
I could take that.

15:54.787 --> 15:59.159
I don't see any reason why
he would reject you, Darlene.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.160
OK, well, I do.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.828
But he's not as
perceptive as me.

16:01.861 --> 16:05.832
God, I'd reject me if I
was him, I mean, I dumped him

16:05.865 --> 16:06.866
and I hurt him really badly.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.071
I really messed
this whole thing up,

16:11.104 --> 16:14.974
and it's all my fault. I just--

16:15.008 --> 16:16.776
please don't make me go
in there and find out.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.445
All right, I'm not going
to make you do anything

16:18.478 --> 16:21.048
that you don't want to do.

16:21.081 --> 16:21.948
Thanks,

16:21.981 --> 16:24.384
Yeah, OK.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.154
I'm not going to even
mention it again.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.055
Appreciate it.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.156
Yup.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.558
Course you know, if
you don't go after him

16:31.591 --> 16:34.994
you're going to regret it
for the rest of your life.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.396
You promised.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.865
I know, dear, but I lied.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.668
Good bye, Mother.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.204
OK, well I guess you
made your final decision.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.074
So all that's left now is just
to find a comfortable chair

16:47.107 --> 16:49.709
and pick a liquor.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.844
I'm putting on my coat.

16:51.878 --> 16:54.947
You know, I almost let your
dad get away from me once.

16:54.981 --> 16:55.882
Really?

16:55.915 --> 16:57.217
Yeah.

16:57.250 --> 17:01.154
Uh-- uh, It was in high school
and we had this big fight,

17:01.188 --> 17:02.955
and I told him that I
hated his guts, you know.

17:02.989 --> 17:05.525
So he starts seeing
this cheerleader.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.860
And they were like,
all over each other.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.830
And then, one time after
a big football game,

17:10.863 --> 17:12.965
he was standing there
with all of his friends,

17:12.999 --> 17:15.168
and I had to force
myself to go up to him

17:15.202 --> 17:18.638
and tell him I was sorry,
and that I wanted him back.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.073
Wow, that must have
been really hard.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.444
All right, I'll do it.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.483
David, just shut up and
listen for a minute!

17:33.720 --> 17:34.521
I need a pencil.

17:40.360 --> 17:45.698
OK, look, I still have a lot
of feelings for you David.

17:45.732 --> 17:50.103
And I want us to get
back together, OK?

17:50.137 --> 17:53.140
So I guess I kind of love you.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.741
But you probably
don't love me anymore,

17:54.774 --> 17:56.509
and I don't blame you after
the way I treated you.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.545
But I just had to tell you
because I think it'd be really

17:58.578 --> 18:00.647
stupid for me not to tell you
when there's a chance that we

18:00.680 --> 18:01.481
might get back together.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.020
I just want don't
want to get hurt.

18:12.125 --> 18:12.992
I won't hurt you, Darlene.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.108
So are we back together again?

18:29.142 --> 18:30.743
Yeah.

18:30.777 --> 18:34.581
Except I have that date tonight.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.016
It's just a movie, I
should be back by 11.

18:37.049 --> 18:40.052
We can start going out then, OK?

18:40.086 --> 18:41.053
OK, fine.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.089
I was just wondering,
how do you plan

18:43.122 --> 18:47.727
on seeing a movie with two
forks stuck in your eye sockets?

18:47.760 --> 18:49.796
Or, you know, I--
I could stay in tonight.

and you ever team up--

to come by and thank

19:50.590 --> 19:54.093
you for all the support you've
given over the past few months.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.896
No problem, I
think you're great.

You know, um, you've got kids,
you're working 16 hours a day.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.202
I mean, where do
you find the time?

20:03.236 --> 20:04.170
