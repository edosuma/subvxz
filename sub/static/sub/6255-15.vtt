WEBVTT

00:04.251 --> 00:06.285
(thunder crashes)

00:06.320 --> 00:09.198
I'll get Christine's boots.
She's gonna need 'em today.

00:10.068 --> 00:12.370
I think she needs a boat.

00:12.404 --> 00:13.805
Or perhaps an ark.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.506
Huh! Hey, that's a
good one, Bones.

00:15.541 --> 00:16.841
Thank you.

00:16.875 --> 00:18.910
It was in reference
to the myth of Noah and...

00:18.944 --> 00:20.978
I got it. Ark. Yes.
...the Ark.

00:21.013 --> 00:23.114
Although that myth
isn't really thought out.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.849
Why's that?
Two of each species?

00:24.883 --> 00:26.684
He would've had
to include

00:26.718 --> 00:27.952
submicroscopic organisms

00:27.986 --> 00:29.654
that make life
possible underwater.

00:29.688 --> 00:31.189
Whoa. What's this?

00:31.223 --> 00:33.424
It was in, uh,
Christine's permission slips.

00:33.458 --> 00:34.792
Oh.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.761
(chuckles)
I wondered where that went.

00:36.795 --> 00:37.962
What do you mean, "Oh"?

00:37.996 --> 00:39.530
It's a check
for $75,000.

00:39.565 --> 00:41.666
That's not just
something you misplace.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.000
It's an advance against

00:43.035 --> 00:45.036
the paperback sales
of my last book.

00:45.070 --> 00:46.470
Can you deposit that
at the bank

00:46.505 --> 00:48.039
after you drop Christine
off at school?

00:48.073 --> 00:49.507
Uh, no, no, no can do.

00:49.541 --> 00:51.375
Because you know what?
It's in your name.

00:51.410 --> 00:52.877
Told you we should get
a joint account.

00:52.911 --> 00:54.045
I'll endorse it
over to you.

00:54.079 --> 00:55.313
No, I can't take that.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.657
That's more than I make
in a year.

00:56.658 --> 00:57.925
What's your
problem, Booth?

00:57.959 --> 00:59.359
We're married now.

00:59.394 --> 01:01.161
Sharing everything
is part of that, isn't it?

01:01.196 --> 01:03.130
Yeah, but I...

01:03.164 --> 01:05.099
I need to get back
to the lab.

01:05.132 --> 01:06.333
Hopefully,
this is murder,

01:06.367 --> 01:09.203
and I will see you soon.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.477
Wow.

01:18.046 --> 01:21.081
MONTENEGRO: So I was online looking
at dream houses,

01:21.116 --> 01:24.051
which got me thinking
about adding an extra room.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.919
And you want a studio.

01:25.954 --> 01:27.788
Which could double
as a bug room.

01:27.822 --> 01:31.024
(scoffs) Listen, I promise
we will do it...

01:31.059 --> 01:33.494
as soon as I find a
suitable bank to rob.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.262
You know, we'd make
a pretty good team.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.330
You could drive the getaway car.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.765
MAN: Excuse me,
Dr. Hodgins?

01:37.799 --> 01:39.466
Yes?

01:39.501 --> 01:40.768
I'm Dr. Rozran.

01:40.802 --> 01:42.736
Okay.

01:42.771 --> 01:44.071
From the Sandalwood Home.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.006
Ah. Sorry.
This is my wife, Angela.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.241
MONTENEGRO:
Hi.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.643
What's the...
the Sandalwood Home?

01:49.677 --> 01:51.745
We're an in-patient
mental health facility.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.647
And since Dr. Hodgins
is the sole survivor

01:53.681 --> 01:54.982
from the
Cantilever Group...

01:55.016 --> 01:56.950
I get it.
I'm sorry, Dr. Rozran.

01:56.985 --> 01:59.286
I'm sure that you've received
generous donations in the past,

01:59.320 --> 02:00.587
but, you see,
the Cantilever Group

02:00.622 --> 02:01.722
doesn't exist anymore.

02:01.756 --> 02:02.956
I'm not here about a donation.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.658
I'm here about your brother.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.827
Since the fund hasn't paid
his expenses for over a year...

02:06.861 --> 02:08.294
(stammers)

02:08.329 --> 02:10.229
You made a mistake.
I don't have a brother.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.933
You're Dr. Jack Hodgins, right?

02:12.967 --> 02:14.468
Son of Jonathan
and Anne Hodgins?

02:14.502 --> 02:17.638
Yeah, but Hodgins
is an only child.

02:17.672 --> 02:19.239
That's not something
you get wrong.

02:19.274 --> 02:22.843
Oh. Uh, since Jeffrey
has been at Sandalwood

02:22.877 --> 02:24.845
since before I got there,

02:24.879 --> 02:27.181
I suppose it's possible
the paperwork is askew.

02:27.215 --> 02:30.951
(clanking)
MAN: Heads up! Watch your back!

02:33.922 --> 02:35.055
Coming through!

02:35.089 --> 02:36.356
Okay, right here.

02:36.391 --> 02:38.358
That will give
everyone access.

02:41.296 --> 02:43.730
Well, uh, sorry for the mix-up
there, Dr. Rozran,

02:43.765 --> 02:45.799
but we really do need
to get going.

02:45.834 --> 02:47.768
Uh, yes, I understand.
Uh... (clears throat)

02:47.802 --> 02:50.003
I'll settle this when
I get back to my office.

02:50.038 --> 02:53.073
I'm sorry to have
bothered you.

02:57.846 --> 03:00.047
(device beeping)

03:04.252 --> 03:06.453
SAROYAN: A ranger at Antietam
Battlefield Park

03:06.487 --> 03:08.355
spotted the feet
when she came in this morning.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.623
BRENNAN:
Are there just legs,

03:09.657 --> 03:12.025
or is there a body
attached to them?

03:12.060 --> 03:13.427
HODGINS:
There's definitely more,

03:13.461 --> 03:14.628
but it could be wrapped
in something

03:14.662 --> 03:15.729
the radar can't get past.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.364
Then we'll have
to excavate.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.033
It's odd that he had
the Cantilever connection

03:20.068 --> 03:21.368
and your parents' names.

03:21.402 --> 03:22.903
Very.

03:22.937 --> 03:25.372
But the fact is a person
doesn't just lose a brother.

03:25.406 --> 03:28.041
I lost my father.
Yes, but you knew you had one.

03:28.076 --> 03:29.309
FISHER:
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

03:29.344 --> 03:31.044
BRENNAN:
You're late, Mr. Fisher.

03:31.079 --> 03:32.279
Apologies.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.348
I was watching the
news and wondering

03:34.382 --> 03:36.183
if it was even worth
getting dressed.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.618
Oh, we've missed you, Fisher.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.853
Doesn't this seem
worth it, Mr. Fisher?

03:39.888 --> 03:41.255
It has possibilities.

03:41.289 --> 03:44.291
The tarsal bone
on the right foot suggests

03:44.325 --> 03:45.726
the victim is female.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.427
And from the looks of it,

03:47.462 --> 03:49.229
the little toe was removed
before she died.

03:49.264 --> 03:50.364
Possible cause of death?

03:50.398 --> 03:51.765
By cutting off
the little toe?

03:51.799 --> 03:52.933
Hemophiliac?

03:53.635 --> 03:54.902
Just saying.

03:54.936 --> 03:57.571
HODGINS:
Think I got something.

04:00.041 --> 04:01.875
Hold on. Nobody touch.

04:01.910 --> 04:04.978
I've seen this before
in New York with gang hits.

04:05.013 --> 04:09.316
This must be what blocked
Hodgins' view on the GPR.

04:15.123 --> 04:17.124
The remains were doused in lye
before they were buried.

04:17.158 --> 04:19.559
HODGINS: Bad news is,
sodium hydroxide

04:19.594 --> 04:21.128
will eat up these remains.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.430
Worse news, this mud and water
will speed the process.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.965
BRENNAN: If the bones
are damaged,

04:24.999 --> 04:26.733
it could obscure evidence.

04:26.768 --> 04:28.502
HODGINS:
Yes, but good news,

04:28.536 --> 04:31.772
vinegar neutralizes lye.

04:31.806 --> 04:33.974
Excuse me.
Ooh.

04:38.046 --> 04:41.782
FISHER (groans): The vinegar is making this
smell like a bad salad.

04:47.322 --> 04:49.356
Based on lye

04:49.390 --> 04:51.325
and desiccated tissue,
I'd say the remains

04:51.359 --> 04:53.994
have been buried a day,
maybe a day and a half ago.

04:54.028 --> 04:58.231
BRENNAN: According to the exposed
tooth-to-pulp ratio,

04:58.266 --> 04:59.933
she was in her mid-20s.

04:59.968 --> 05:02.402
The angular nature
of the orbital socket

05:02.437 --> 05:04.271
suggests she is Caucasian.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.173
There's extensive damage
to the dentition.

05:06.207 --> 05:09.109
Two, three, eight
upper and lower teeth

05:09.143 --> 05:11.211
on the right side
have been smashed.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.213
We won't get an I.D.
from dentals.

05:13.247 --> 05:14.915
Lye, smashing
of the teeth?

05:14.949 --> 05:16.616
Somebody really
didn't want us

05:16.651 --> 05:18.952
to find out who
this woman was.

05:52.759 --> 05:54.716
Look, if you can't bury
a body deep enough,

05:54.717 --> 05:57.252
you cover it in lye so the
animals don't dig it up.

05:57.287 --> 05:58.220
It's classic Al Capone.

05:58.254 --> 05:59.588
You think
it was a mob hit?

05:59.622 --> 06:01.723
Oh, geez, what,
a girl in her 20s?

06:01.724 --> 06:02.791
That's sexist.

06:02.825 --> 06:04.292
Nowadays a girl
in her 20s can be

06:04.326 --> 06:05.727
just as much a mobster
as a guy.

06:05.761 --> 06:06.928
Wonderful how far
we've come.

06:06.962 --> 06:08.196
All right, listen.

06:08.230 --> 06:10.799
I want you to take
these cases, okay?

06:10.833 --> 06:12.467
See if there's
any similar crimes.

06:12.501 --> 06:13.735
You're very brusque today.

06:13.769 --> 06:16.071
What?
Brusque. It's a word.

06:16.105 --> 06:18.073
All right, here we go.
Howard Viceroy. Forget it.

06:18.107 --> 06:19.941
The M.O.'s right, but the guy's
in Hazelton for life.

06:19.975 --> 06:21.142
You know what?
Why don't you just

06:21.177 --> 06:23.078
go to your office,
go through all these

06:23.112 --> 06:24.746
and see what you
come up with, okay?

06:24.780 --> 06:26.047
All of these?

06:26.082 --> 06:27.682
You're a profiler.
So go profile.

06:28.651 --> 06:30.318
I think you got a check here.

06:30.352 --> 06:32.187
What? Give me that.

06:32.221 --> 06:33.922
It's not mine. It's Bones's.

06:33.956 --> 06:35.156
And that's upsetting to you?

06:35.191 --> 06:36.658
No, it doesn't upset me.

06:37.693 --> 06:40.095
Kind of. You see this?

06:40.129 --> 06:43.103
That's for $75,000, okay?

06:43.104 --> 06:44.938
Bones endorsed it over to me.
It's a nice present.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.207
It's not a present, okay?
She wants me to put it

06:47.241 --> 06:49.609
into the bank.
We don't have a joint account.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.277
Oh.
"Oh."

06:51.312 --> 06:52.579
Do me a favor.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.347
Don't give me
the whole "oh" thing.

06:54.382 --> 06:57.751
You got something to say, just say it.
Okay.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.854
With the traditional male-female
dynamic changing in society,

07:00.888 --> 07:02.922
your reluctance to
commingle your finances

07:02.957 --> 07:05.425
implies that it touches
on issues of manhood

07:05.459 --> 07:06.893
and your status
in the relationship.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.029
What?
Look, money can cause

07:09.063 --> 07:10.930
a lot of emotional issues
in couples, right?

07:10.965 --> 07:12.332
Resentment,

07:12.366 --> 07:13.400
insecurity, impotence.

07:13.434 --> 07:14.567
Hold on
right there, okay?

07:14.602 --> 07:16.236
Bones and I are just fine.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.605
In every room of our house,
thank you very much.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.140
And yet that
check still

07:20.174 --> 07:22.409
strikes a nerve, doesn't it?
I tell you what.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.444
Just, here, take 'em.
Take the files.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.879
Go shrink 'em.
Shrink it down.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.648
You don't shrink files.
You read them.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.283
Just shrink it down.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.755
FISHER: Are any of those fractures
caused by the burial?

07:35.790 --> 07:37.957
No, they're all perimortem.

07:37.992 --> 07:39.626
Looks like
repeated trauma

07:39.660 --> 07:41.694
to the parietal bone
along the sagittal suture.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.196
Criminals never disappoint,
do they?

07:43.230 --> 07:45.065
There are other
bone injuries,

07:45.099 --> 07:47.434
but we need the tissue removed
before we can examine them.

07:47.468 --> 07:50.270
That's a nasty crack
on the head.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.238
It appears
the killer repeatedly smashed

07:52.273 --> 07:54.808
the victim's head
into a hard surface.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.177
But it doesn't appear
to be cause of death.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.978
Well, I found out
who she is.

07:59.013 --> 08:03.450
The remaining tissue provided
enough DNA for an I.D.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.785
The victim is
Lauren Frank

08:05.820 --> 08:08.188
of Arlington,
Virginia.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.059
These are my parents'
signatures.

08:13.094 --> 08:15.095
And the dates all track.

08:15.129 --> 08:17.831
I was the only child
in that house.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.266
I never even heard the name
Jeffrey mentioned.

08:20.301 --> 08:22.635
It seems when your mother
was pregnant with you,

08:22.670 --> 08:24.938
your parents decided it would
be best if Jeffrey received

08:24.972 --> 08:27.507
full-time care and supervision.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.075
So they warehoused my brother?

08:29.110 --> 08:30.977
They were protecting
him from himself.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.479
And protecting you.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.114
He's violent?

08:34.148 --> 08:35.881
Jeffrey has
schizo-affective disorder.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.884
When he's on his meds
and receiving proper treatment,

08:37.918 --> 08:39.619
he's manageable,
quite intelligent

08:39.653 --> 08:41.321
and very pleasant
company.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.789
And when he doesn't have
proper care?

08:43.823 --> 08:46.993
He's ill, Dr. Hodgins,
and his illness can flare up.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.561
We're not a
lockdown facility.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.563
Sometimes he disappears.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.398
How does he get back?
He usually goes to one

08:52.433 --> 08:55.201
of a few places he knows,
so he's not difficult to find.

08:55.236 --> 08:56.870
But with a case
like your brother's,

08:56.904 --> 08:58.138
his care and supervision

08:58.172 --> 09:00.373
are expensive.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.512
That's why the board
had me contact you.

09:05.546 --> 09:09.616
But I don't have
any money anymore.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.752
Dr. Hodgins?

09:12.786 --> 09:14.287
Yeah, sorry. It's just...

09:14.321 --> 09:16.456
it's a lot to get
my head around, you know?

09:16.490 --> 09:18.258
I mean, one day,
you're an only child,

09:18.292 --> 09:20.793
and then... all this.

09:23.264 --> 09:25.398
I can only imagine.

09:27.468 --> 09:29.402
There's Jeffrey.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.385
SWEETS:
<i>Lauren Frank, 26 years old,</i>

09:45.419 --> 09:47.854
still in community college,
parents divorced.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.589
Lives with her father
and stepmother.

09:49.623 --> 09:52.592
You know, the dad's the CEO
of Highpark, Incorporated,

09:52.626 --> 09:54.160
some big software company.

09:54.195 --> 09:55.895
He's loaded-- like, tens
of millions of loaded.

09:55.930 --> 09:57.731
Yeah, the stepmother is listed
as a homemaker.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.432
I don't understand.
This girl Lauren,

09:59.466 --> 10:01.768
she was 26 years old
and she still hadn't moved out.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.503
Yeah, it's more common
than not these days.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.205
They're called "perma-children."

10:05.239 --> 10:07.006
You know, between student loans,
high rents, low-paying jobs,

10:07.041 --> 10:08.608
living with your parents
starts to look good.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.944
Well, it didn't work out
too well for Lauren.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.479
This is them, all right?

10:15.449 --> 10:17.617
Did you find her?
Did you find Lauren?

10:17.651 --> 10:20.453
I'm sorry.
How long... was she missing?

10:20.487 --> 10:21.721
Yeah, there's no report filed.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.023
She didn't tell you?

10:25.326 --> 10:26.659
You haven't talked
to her, have you?

10:26.694 --> 10:28.334
No, sir.
I thought we were here because...

10:28.362 --> 10:30.597
Don't say anything,
Katherine. Not a word.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.632
I don't know why you thought
we brought you in.

10:32.666 --> 10:33.933
We shouldn't have come.
They told us not to.

10:33.968 --> 10:35.501
Oh, God, what
have we done?

10:35.536 --> 10:36.869
She was kidnapped.

10:38.606 --> 10:41.040
We got a... we got
a package delivered.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.610
Katherine!
It's over, Steven. They know.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.144
There's nothing
we can do now.

10:45.179 --> 10:46.446
Sorry. The package?

10:46.480 --> 10:47.960
We found it outside
our front doorstep

10:47.982 --> 10:49.382
yesterday morning
with a note.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.151
"Call the police
and Lauren dies.

10:52.186 --> 10:53.586
Instructions to follow."

10:53.621 --> 10:54.887
KATHERINE:
And inside...

10:54.922 --> 10:56.389
Was her toe.

10:58.025 --> 11:02.362
If you haven't found her,
why are we here?

11:05.266 --> 11:06.833
We're sorry to inform you

11:06.867 --> 11:08.501
that we found your daughter's
body this morning.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.571
We think that she
was murdered.

11:11.605 --> 11:12.672
No.

11:12.706 --> 11:13.673
We did everything.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.141
We were waiting, we...

11:15.175 --> 11:16.542
I would've paid,
I would've paid anything.

11:16.577 --> 11:17.543
Why would they do this?

11:17.578 --> 11:19.646
(phone dings)

11:22.549 --> 11:25.018
I can't believe this.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.519
The bastards!

11:26.553 --> 11:27.787
It's the kidnapper.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.055
He still thinks
he can get the money.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.857
He doesn't know
we found her yet.

11:30.891 --> 11:31.924
That was a big mistake.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.426
Listen, we're gonna find out

11:33.460 --> 11:34.927
who did this to your daughter.

11:43.421 --> 11:44.855
STEVEN: The kidnapper said
he was watching us.

11:44.889 --> 11:46.289
That's why we didn't
call the police.

11:46.324 --> 11:47.490
That's what he
wanted you to think

11:47.525 --> 11:48.859
so no one would
go after him.

11:48.893 --> 11:50.627
Are you sure that
Lauren didn't go out

11:50.661 --> 11:52.429
with anyone that night, to
a party or anything like that?

11:52.463 --> 11:53.830
No, she would've told us,
said good-bye.

11:53.865 --> 11:55.298
KATHERINE: She had no cause
to sneak out.

11:55.333 --> 11:56.867
It's not like
she was a teenager.

11:56.901 --> 11:58.101
And when she didn't come
down for breakfast,

11:58.135 --> 11:59.603
we went to her room.

11:59.637 --> 12:01.171
That's when we'd found
she was gone.

12:01.205 --> 12:03.974
The angle of the incision
on the toe

12:04.008 --> 12:05.642
matches the injury
(dog barking)

12:05.676 --> 12:08.245
to the distal metatarsal at the lab.
He smells the toe!

12:08.279 --> 12:11.281
Get him out of here!
Otis, here, here, Otis!

12:11.315 --> 12:13.283
What the hell's going on, Chuck?
I'm-I'm sorry, Steven. He got out.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.185
I was about to feed him...
Just remove him!

12:15.219 --> 12:16.286
I-I don't want
the evidence compromised.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.754
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who are you?

12:17.788 --> 12:19.689
Chuck Winter. He's in
charge of the house.

12:19.724 --> 12:21.758
He's not doing a particularly
good job right now.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.026
BOOTH: Where you here the
night that, uh,

12:23.060 --> 12:24.828
Lauren was kidnapped?
I live here.

12:24.862 --> 12:26.263
I have a suite off the kitchen.

12:26.297 --> 12:27.631
If there's anything I can do...

12:27.665 --> 12:29.132
Yeah, I'm sure we'll
be talking to you.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.567
Can you get the
dog out of here?

12:30.601 --> 12:31.835
Okay. Come on.

12:33.271 --> 12:34.404
The toe was removed poorly.

12:34.438 --> 12:36.573
The tissue's torn.

12:36.607 --> 12:38.341
The bone is splintered.

12:38.376 --> 12:41.177
It was basically ripped off.
Oh, God!

12:41.212 --> 12:42.946
We can get into the details
later, okay, Bones?

12:42.980 --> 12:44.380
Well, I'd like
to see Lauren's room.

12:44.382 --> 12:46.216
We'd like
to see her room, okay?

12:52.223 --> 12:54.791
Emergency fire ladder--
that's how they got her out.

12:54.825 --> 12:56.493
All the second-floor bedrooms
are equipped with them.

12:56.527 --> 12:59.562
You think that there was more
than one kidnapper, Booth?

12:59.597 --> 13:01.131
At least two.

13:01.165 --> 13:02.950
One to carry her and the
other to steady the ladder.

13:02.951 --> 13:04.262
You're sure you haven't 
touched anything, right?

13:04.287 --> 13:05.440
No, of course not.

13:05.441 --> 13:08.343
There's no evidence that
her toe was severed here.

13:08.378 --> 13:09.678
No blood evidence at all.

13:09.712 --> 13:11.713
No sign of a struggle,
she was probably

13:11.748 --> 13:13.115
abducted in her sleep.

13:13.149 --> 13:15.517
Now, there's sensors
here on the door.

13:15.551 --> 13:17.386
Why didn't the alarms go off
when they were opened?

13:17.420 --> 13:19.187
It was my fault.

13:19.222 --> 13:21.790
I told her the air conditioning
was drying out her skin.

13:21.824 --> 13:23.091
It's not your fault.
She hated me,

13:23.126 --> 13:24.993
Steven, no matter
what I did.

13:25.027 --> 13:26.294
Oh, now I can never...

13:26.329 --> 13:27.863
I can never
make it up to her.

13:27.897 --> 13:29.030
Can I take her downstairs?

13:29.065 --> 13:30.198
BOOTH:
Yeah, it's probably best.

13:30.233 --> 13:32.367
Come on.

13:32.402 --> 13:34.736
I should get back
to the lab, Booth.

13:34.771 --> 13:36.371
There's nothing more
for me here.

13:36.406 --> 13:37.839
Take the laptop, okay?

13:37.874 --> 13:40.475
See if Angela can get
anything off that, will you?

13:58.327 --> 13:59.895
The <i>Nautilus.</i>

13:59.929 --> 14:02.164
Hey, that's
excellent detail

14:02.198 --> 14:03.565
on the <i>Architeuthis.</i>

14:03.599 --> 14:05.534
(laughs)
You like Jules Verne?

14:05.568 --> 14:07.335
He's in my top three.

14:07.370 --> 14:08.403
(quiet laugh)

14:08.438 --> 14:10.739
I'm...

14:10.773 --> 14:11.773
Jack.

14:11.808 --> 14:13.575
Jeffrey.

14:13.609 --> 14:14.910
(quiet laugh)

14:14.944 --> 14:16.978
I've read everything
Verne's written.

14:17.013 --> 14:18.680
Yeah, me, too.

14:18.714 --> 14:20.949
I mean, we're still
catching up to the...

14:20.983 --> 14:22.884
to the discoveries and
inventions in his books.

14:22.919 --> 14:24.953
Oh, it's amazing
how many novelists can see

14:24.987 --> 14:26.521
what the future holds

14:26.556 --> 14:28.390
before the technologies
even exist.

14:28.424 --> 14:29.458
Yeah, yeah.

14:29.492 --> 14:30.926
Einstein always said

14:30.960 --> 14:33.628
imagination is more powerful
than knowledge.

14:33.663 --> 14:35.597
Yeah, well, uh, they weaponized
most of Einstein's findings

14:35.631 --> 14:37.365
as fast as they could.
(laughs)

14:37.400 --> 14:39.201
They always say
they're gonna use

14:39.235 --> 14:41.636
science for good,
but they never do.

14:41.671 --> 14:44.573
Please do not even get me
started on what "they" do.

14:44.607 --> 14:46.508
All of our problems
would be solved

14:46.542 --> 14:48.076
if they let
scientists run things.

14:48.110 --> 14:49.845
But then, I've been told

14:49.879 --> 14:51.813
I'm kind of
a conspiracy nut, so...

14:51.848 --> 14:54.416
Does that mean you can see, too?

14:54.450 --> 14:55.550
See what?

14:55.585 --> 14:58.487
Past the static?

14:59.956 --> 15:02.157
They use static
electricity to...

15:02.191 --> 15:04.259
to mask the changes.

15:04.293 --> 15:06.228
It's what Bradbury warned us.

15:06.262 --> 15:08.129
Changes so subtle,
you'd hardly even notice.

15:08.164 --> 15:09.397
New pills, hmm?

15:09.432 --> 15:12.200
All of a sudden
there are blue M&M's?

15:12.235 --> 15:15.337
I-I-I may have misled you,
Jeffrey, on the conspiracy...

15:15.371 --> 15:17.272
No, no. No!

15:17.306 --> 15:19.040
They will try to slip things
by you like Twitter.

15:19.075 --> 15:21.109
And... GPS.

15:21.143 --> 15:24.112
And the next thing you know,
you're living on Titan.

15:24.146 --> 15:25.580
Or one of the moons of Neptune!

15:25.615 --> 15:27.482
See, this is just a way station;
it's not real.

15:27.517 --> 15:29.584
None of this is real.
Hey, Jeffrey, hey, Jeffrey, it's okay.

15:29.619 --> 15:31.219
None of this is real.
No, no!

15:31.254 --> 15:33.321
They are trying... They will use the static!
Hey, hey!

15:33.356 --> 15:35.323
He won't be able to see!
I-I-I know.

15:35.358 --> 15:36.542
I know, I know. 
We hear it, we can hear it...

15:36.567 --> 15:37.826
I want... No, Sean!

15:37.827 --> 15:39.961
Sean, an
Yes, yes, it's Sean.

15:39.996 --> 15:42.597
Right here,
right here. Okay?

15:42.632 --> 15:45.200
All right, stay with me, okay?
Sean. Mm-hmm.

15:45.234 --> 15:47.502
It's okay.

15:51.307 --> 15:53.241
I don't... I don't know...
I don't know what happened.

15:53.276 --> 15:54.376
I mean, we-we were talking.

15:54.410 --> 15:56.444
He was fine, and then...

15:56.479 --> 15:58.080
I shouldn't have said
what I said, but...

15:58.114 --> 15:59.447
You didn't do anything.

15:59.482 --> 16:02.851
This is what I was trying
to explain earlier.

16:02.885 --> 16:05.387
This is what your parents knew.

16:16.265 --> 16:17.933
MONTENEGRO:
<i>Uh, her computer</i>

16:17.967 --> 16:19.968
was encrypted, but
since it was filled

16:20.002 --> 16:21.303
her father's software,

16:21.337 --> 16:24.306
he was able to give
me a work-around.

16:24.340 --> 16:27.042
Hodgins is with his brother now?

16:27.076 --> 16:30.412
Yeah, at the place.

16:30.446 --> 16:32.914
His brother freaked out
for no reason,

16:32.949 --> 16:34.949
just when Hodgins was feeling
comfortable with him.

16:34.951 --> 16:38.253
It just...
it hit Hodgins pretty hard.

16:38.287 --> 16:40.422
It must be difficult
for you, too,

16:40.456 --> 16:43.525
knowing that Hodgins
is so upset.

16:43.559 --> 16:46.261
It's just that Hodgins feels
so helpless

16:46.295 --> 16:49.431
knowing that his brother has
to be moved to a state facility.

16:49.465 --> 16:51.199
I'm sure you'll find
good care there.

16:51.233 --> 16:52.567
But Sandalwood

16:52.602 --> 16:55.403
has been Jeffrey's home
for over 30 years.

16:57.907 --> 16:59.441
I'm sorry.

17:00.576 --> 17:03.545
Just a period of adjustment,
I guess.

17:05.381 --> 17:07.348
Oh...

17:07.383 --> 17:08.750
(ringing)

17:08.784 --> 17:10.585
Um...

17:10.619 --> 17:13.989
This is Lauren's reminder list.

17:14.022 --> 17:16.790
The last one set to go off
before the kidnapping was,

17:19.595 --> 17:22.097
Spanish review with Mauricio.".

17:29.205 --> 17:31.373
SWEETS: So, you're Lauren's
Spanish teacher Mauricio?

17:31.407 --> 17:33.308
I'm just
the teacher's assistant.

17:33.342 --> 17:34.676
Look, two suits with guns

17:34.710 --> 17:37.512
show up at class and
take me to the FBI.

17:37.546 --> 17:40.548
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

17:42.018 --> 17:44.185
Lauren's dead.

17:44.220 --> 17:45.553
She was kidnapped

17:45.588 --> 17:48.490
and murdered
two nights ago.

17:48.524 --> 17:51.593
I-I'm sorry, this is a shock.

17:51.627 --> 17:54.929
Lauren was more than just
your student, wasn't she?

17:54.964 --> 17:56.064
Yes.

17:56.098 --> 17:57.699
We're dating.

17:57.733 --> 18:01.069
We planned a hiking
tour of South America.

18:01.103 --> 18:03.271
We planned on
leaving next week.

18:03.305 --> 18:04.626
So, next week--
you... you must've

18:04.640 --> 18:05.807
already bought
your ticket, then?

18:05.841 --> 18:07.409
Yes. Why?

18:07.443 --> 18:09.744
Uh, well, judging
from her laptop,

18:09.779 --> 18:13.281
Lauren was pretty organized,
but we found no plans,

18:13.315 --> 18:16.184
no tickets booked for next week.

18:16.218 --> 18:17.552
Weren't you planning
to fly together?

18:17.586 --> 18:20.455
I used miles and got
the last available seat.

18:20.489 --> 18:23.525
She was gonna get a ticket
on another flight.

18:25.127 --> 18:26.361
Meet up in Chile.

18:26.395 --> 18:27.462
I see.

18:27.496 --> 18:28.930
Where were you two nights ago?

18:30.332 --> 18:32.534
I was home.

18:32.568 --> 18:35.537
Grading term papers.

18:35.571 --> 18:38.106
Okay, well, I'm gonna
need you to stay here

18:38.140 --> 18:40.008
until the agent in charge
returns.

18:40.042 --> 18:41.376
Why?
Why?

18:41.410 --> 18:42.644
'Cause you have no alibi
and a ticket

18:42.678 --> 18:43.678
to leave the country.

18:43.713 --> 18:45.346
I'm telling the truth!

18:45.381 --> 18:46.614
I love Lauren.

18:46.649 --> 18:48.016
Yeah, but there's
also the possibility

18:48.050 --> 18:49.451
that you were planning

18:49.485 --> 18:51.986
to leave the country
with the ransom money.

18:58.594 --> 19:00.295
According to the log,
Lauren turned off

19:00.329 --> 19:02.030
the door sensor at 1:12.

19:02.064 --> 19:03.231
And you can see she does this

19:03.265 --> 19:04.399
around the same time
every night.

19:04.433 --> 19:05.767
You don't have
any more footage

19:05.801 --> 19:06.753
from the security
cameras after that?

19:06.754 --> 19:07.553
No.

19:07.578 --> 19:09.661
That's pretty convenient
for the kidnappers.

19:10.139 --> 19:12.941
And you oversee all
of this, huh, Chuck?

19:12.975 --> 19:14.209
Okay, hold on.

19:14.243 --> 19:16.010
At 2:00 a.m.,
the system rebooted

19:16.045 --> 19:17.545
for scheduled maintenance.

19:17.580 --> 19:19.914
Normally that's a 30-second
interruption of service,

19:19.949 --> 19:21.483
but it never booted up
that night.

19:21.517 --> 19:23.017
Steven thought
it was probably a bug

19:23.052 --> 19:24.452
in the new software
or something.

19:24.487 --> 19:25.487
Right, so someone knew

19:25.521 --> 19:26.955
about the ladders, right?

19:26.989 --> 19:28.823
And they also knew about
when the security systems

19:28.858 --> 19:30.191
were gonna reboot.

19:30.226 --> 19:31.559
Not too many people
with that kind

19:31.594 --> 19:32.560
of information, right, Chuck?

19:32.595 --> 19:33.628
Everybody
in the family.

19:33.662 --> 19:35.530
The security team, the patrol.

19:35.564 --> 19:36.865
Right, and you were here

19:36.899 --> 19:38.566
that night in-in your suite
off the kitchen?

19:38.601 --> 19:39.834
Yes, all night.

19:39.869 --> 19:41.636
And was up and made sure

19:41.670 --> 19:42.788
that breakfast was ready
in the morning.

19:42.813 --> 19:43.606
I'm sure you were.

19:43.607 --> 19:45.874
But since we seem to think
this was a two-man job,

19:45.908 --> 19:48.443
you understand I have
to ask these questions?

19:49.245 --> 19:51.279
Sure.

19:51.313 --> 19:53.581
(computer dinging)

19:53.616 --> 19:55.083
Who the hell is that?

19:55.117 --> 19:56.451
I'll call security.
Uh-uh.

19:56.485 --> 19:58.186
I'm your security.

20:01.457 --> 20:03.224
Hey, where you going?

20:03.259 --> 20:05.026
Hold on. FBI.

20:06.462 --> 20:08.530
Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Easy, hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:08.564 --> 20:11.065
Hey, hey, hey, hey, all right,
all right, easy, come on.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.334
All right, oh-oh, right there. Okay.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

20:13.369 --> 20:13.929
Who are you?

20:13.954 --> 20:16.382
I'm here for Otis. Um, my code
for the gate didn't work.

20:16.739 --> 20:18.773
They must've changed it.
Who are you?

20:18.808 --> 20:20.408
I'm Buddy, the dog walker.

20:20.442 --> 20:21.476
From the vet.

20:21.510 --> 20:23.378
Look, my shirt.

20:25.314 --> 20:28.016
Okay, with all this land, why do
the Franks need a dog walker?

20:28.050 --> 20:29.184
Otis likes to swim.

20:29.218 --> 20:30.852
You know,
I take him to the beach.

20:30.886 --> 20:32.020
I groom him. Look, ask Lauren.

20:32.054 --> 20:33.421
Lauren's dead.

20:33.455 --> 20:34.656
What?

20:34.690 --> 20:35.990
She's dead. Get up.

20:37.193 --> 20:38.259
How well did you know her?

20:38.294 --> 20:39.294
Sometimes, when
I'd drop off

20:39.328 --> 20:40.829
Otis, you know, we'd sit

20:40.863 --> 20:42.163
on her deck and talk.

20:42.198 --> 20:43.731
Talk?
What did you talk about?

20:43.766 --> 20:45.133
She... she mention anybody
coming around here?

20:45.167 --> 20:47.368
Was she afraid of anyone,
any strangers?

20:47.403 --> 20:49.470
No, mostly she just talked
about how messed up

20:49.505 --> 20:50.672
things are for her here.

20:50.706 --> 20:52.173
Messed up how?

20:52.208 --> 20:53.488
Well, how she wanted
to move out.

20:53.509 --> 20:55.043
How she and her stepmom
fought a lot.

20:55.077 --> 20:57.278
And she said
that one time

20:57.313 --> 21:00.915
she saw the stepmom
and the trainer, like...

21:00.950 --> 21:02.183
you know.

21:02.218 --> 21:03.251
No, I don't.

21:03.285 --> 21:04.552
What?
Like...

21:04.587 --> 21:07.288
like...
Lauren told you that?

21:07.323 --> 21:08.556
She said things were
pretty messed up here.

21:08.591 --> 21:10.158
STEVEN:
It's them!

21:10.192 --> 21:12.093
They sent texts

21:12.127 --> 21:13.661
with attachments.

21:14.763 --> 21:17.498
MAN (distorted voice):
$3 million

21:17.533 --> 21:19.434
in small, unmarked bills.

21:19.468 --> 21:22.637
Our next message will have
instructions for the exchange.

21:26.162 --> 21:28.119
So, you can track
where the texts came from?

21:28.355 --> 21:30.737
Uh, theoretically.
Each file,

21:30.738 --> 21:32.572
like the picture
of Lauren that was sent

21:32.607 --> 21:34.374
and the audio message
from the kidnappers--

21:34.408 --> 21:37.077
each has a digital
fingerprint.

21:37.111 --> 21:38.345
That's great.

21:38.379 --> 21:40.347
Yeah, it's half great.
I also need

21:40.381 --> 21:43.016
the fingerprint of the phone or
computer that sent those texts.

21:43.050 --> 21:46.853
That fingerprint will tell us
whose phone and where it is.

21:46.887 --> 21:48.255
And that's a problem?

21:48.289 --> 21:49.322
Whatever phone was used

21:49.357 --> 21:51.524
was turned on to send the text

21:51.559 --> 21:53.994
and then turned right off.
Ah, so it wasn't turned on

21:54.028 --> 21:56.529
long enough for you to trace it.
Exactly.

21:56.564 --> 21:58.465
But there has to be
a way around it.

21:58.499 --> 22:00.066
I mean, I have half the picture.

22:00.101 --> 22:02.135
I just have to fill in the rest.

22:02.169 --> 22:03.870
Hey!

22:03.904 --> 22:05.672
Hodgins!

22:05.706 --> 22:07.374
Hey, uh, sorry I've
been away so long.

22:07.408 --> 22:09.109
So I'm gonna get
right back to work.

22:09.143 --> 22:10.377
Hodgins, please.

22:10.411 --> 22:13.513
We have our work
and we have our families,

22:13.547 --> 22:15.782
and yours just got
unexpectedly bigger, so...

22:15.816 --> 22:17.884
anything I can do
to make things easier...

22:17.886 --> 22:20.220
Just let me sift through the pile
of particulates waiting for me.

22:20.254 --> 22:22.222
Honey, you don't have to jump
right back in. You can...

22:22.256 --> 22:23.923
We have a murder
to solve, so, yeah.

22:23.958 --> 22:25.925
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm back.

22:32.233 --> 22:34.634
There are a number of
microfractures on the pisiform

22:34.669 --> 22:36.536
the X-rays didn't show.

22:36.570 --> 22:38.004
They're similar to those

22:38.039 --> 22:39.606
we found on
the back of the skull.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.141
Did you find them anywhere else?
Uh, yes.

22:41.175 --> 22:43.276
Pisiform, triquetrum

22:43.311 --> 22:44.511
and lunate-- bilaterally.

22:44.545 --> 22:47.147
She was repeatedly
smashing

22:47.181 --> 22:49.316
her fists against
something.

22:49.350 --> 22:52.285
And the calcanei,
bilaterally.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.020
All perimortem?

22:54.055 --> 22:55.255
Yes.

22:55.289 --> 22:57.057
These all indicate
quite a struggle.

22:57.091 --> 22:59.259
She probably tried to escape
and fought with her kidnappers.

22:59.293 --> 23:00.727
No.

23:00.761 --> 23:03.590
The victim banged her own
head into the ground,

23:03.591 --> 23:04.924
and fists and heels.

23:04.959 --> 23:07.594
Wait, what?
Uniform, repeated injuries.

23:07.628 --> 23:09.896
They're all signs of a seizure.
Oh, my God.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.364
You're right.

23:11.398 --> 23:12.565
Well, I feel inadequate.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.300
You work with me,
Mr. Fisher.

23:14.335 --> 23:16.269
I'd have thought you'd
be used to that by now.

23:16.303 --> 23:18.571
The question we
need to answer

23:18.606 --> 23:21.107
is: What caused the seizure?

23:30.651 --> 23:31.951
Hey.
So I...

23:31.986 --> 23:33.353
I-I swabbed
the kerf marks

23:33.387 --> 23:34.587
Fisher and Dr. Brennan
found on the ulna.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.089
It appears to be
a brand-new saw.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.624
I mean, the oil on it...
I don't care.

23:37.658 --> 23:39.225
Well, it's just that
it's different from

23:39.260 --> 23:40.794
whatever was used
to sever the toe.

23:40.828 --> 23:42.428
So after I figure out
what the beetles ate...

23:42.463 --> 23:44.597
Hodgins, stop. Stop.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.766
Just talk to me.

23:50.938 --> 23:52.672
(sighs)

23:52.706 --> 23:54.240
I want to, Ange.

23:54.275 --> 23:56.342
It's just...
I-I don't know how.

23:56.377 --> 23:58.211
It was just me.

23:58.245 --> 24:00.180
It was always
just me, and now...

24:00.214 --> 24:02.081
Okay. Okay.

24:02.116 --> 24:04.484
So just let
that sink in.

24:04.518 --> 24:05.885
And please don't
shut me out.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.922
This is... this is
happening to both of us.

24:15.663 --> 24:18.498
(sighs)

24:18.532 --> 24:21.000
He has my mom's eyes.

24:26.941 --> 24:30.210
And he loves Jules Verne,
you know?

24:30.244 --> 24:32.478
Just like me.

24:32.513 --> 24:33.947
I mean, we were...

24:33.981 --> 24:36.015
we were having a great time,
Angie, you know?

24:36.050 --> 24:37.750
I-I thought he could
come home, you know?

24:37.785 --> 24:39.686
He could live with us.
But, uh...

24:39.720 --> 24:42.689
I don't know,
I just... I...

24:44.225 --> 24:47.327
I said something
that set him off,

24:47.361 --> 24:49.629
and I-I could not
reel him back in.

24:49.663 --> 24:51.030
I...

24:54.168 --> 24:56.803
(sighs)

24:56.837 --> 24:58.938
I kept thinking, after...

24:58.973 --> 25:01.341
if-if we had known each other
when I was growing up,

25:01.375 --> 25:02.675
maybe-maybe I
could've helped,

25:02.710 --> 25:05.178
maybe he wouldn't
be where he is now.

25:07.448 --> 25:09.048
You know that
that is not true.

25:09.083 --> 25:10.450
No?

25:12.786 --> 25:15.288
I could have loved him.

25:17.558 --> 25:20.660
You can do that now.

25:20.694 --> 25:23.162
You can still love him.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.872
All I'm saying is that
this is your money,

25:32.907 --> 25:35.642
from your hard work,
not mine.

25:35.676 --> 25:37.543
Men are so foolish
when it comes to money.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.112
It's why we have
so many wars.

25:39.146 --> 25:41.147
You like your loot covered
in blood and sweat.

25:41.181 --> 25:42.849
It's the only way
you can enjoy it.

25:42.883 --> 25:44.717
Okay, great. So, what?
I'm Attila the Hun, now?

25:44.752 --> 25:46.319
I mean, come on.
You're a little bit...

25:46.353 --> 25:48.121
What do you mean, a little bit
like Attila the Hun?

25:48.155 --> 25:50.390
There he is.
Sweets.

25:50.424 --> 25:51.824
So I talked
to the trainer

25:51.859 --> 25:53.192
that Katherine Frank
was sleeping with.

25:53.227 --> 25:55.128
He was out of town
when Lauren disappeared.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.396
He still is.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.730
So he's not an accomplice.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.599
And she's not a suspect.
Not so fast.

25:59.633 --> 26:01.734
Check this out.

26:03.404 --> 26:04.704
What do we got here?

26:04.738 --> 26:05.939
Kidnapping and
ransom insurance...

26:05.973 --> 26:07.540
She took out a
kidnapping policy

26:07.574 --> 26:08.975
on her whole family.

26:09.009 --> 26:10.944
BRENNAN: So... what?
She kidnaps Lauren,

26:10.978 --> 26:12.178
things goes wrong,

26:12.212 --> 26:13.573
she still tries
to get the money...

26:13.580 --> 26:15.048
(phone ringing)
Booth.

26:15.082 --> 26:16.382
MONTENEGRO:
The victim's phone

26:16.417 --> 26:17.951
sent those texts,

26:17.985 --> 26:19.619
and the phone is still
in the victim's house.

26:19.653 --> 26:21.521
The ransom texts were sent
from Lauren's phone.

26:21.555 --> 26:22.855
It's still
in the house.

26:22.890 --> 26:24.090
Yeah, the east side

26:24.124 --> 26:25.325
of the house, to be exact.

26:25.359 --> 26:26.726
Call me when
you get there, Booth,

26:26.760 --> 26:28.194
and I'll tell you
where to find it.

26:28.228 --> 26:29.529
I need that phone to see

26:29.563 --> 26:31.083
the other information
that it contains.

26:31.179 --> 26:32.479
All right, we're on our way.

26:32.513 --> 26:33.793
We'll call you
when we get there.

26:33.815 --> 26:37.050
(siren whooping)

26:38.245 --> 26:40.325
BOOTH:
Okay, we're here, Angela.

26:40.326 --> 26:41.242
KATHERINE:
What's he doing, Steven?

26:41.243 --> 26:42.129
STEVEN: What's going on,
Agent Booth?

26:42.130 --> 26:43.430
Please let me do my job.

26:43.464 --> 26:45.198
MONTENEGRO:
I'm using Reverse 911

26:45.233 --> 26:47.801
to turn on the phone,
so listen for it.

26:47.835 --> 26:49.369
Okay, Bones, listen for
a high-pitched squeal.

26:49.404 --> 26:50.604
(high-pitched tone sounding)

26:50.638 --> 26:51.905
Down that hallway, Booth!

26:51.939 --> 26:53.273
Yeah.

26:55.510 --> 26:58.078
(high-pitched tone continues)

26:59.480 --> 27:01.315
BOOTH: Got it?
Got it, Booth!

27:01.349 --> 27:04.051
So is this your
exercise equipment?

27:04.085 --> 27:05.319
Yes.

27:05.353 --> 27:06.520
That's Lauren's phone.

27:06.554 --> 27:08.789
KATHERINE:
I-I didn't know

27:08.823 --> 27:10.590
it was in there.

27:12.293 --> 27:14.428
Don't look at me like that.

27:20.855 --> 27:23.890
So, we know that you and your
trainer were having an affair.

27:25.086 --> 27:27.013
All right, according
to your prenup,

27:27.014 --> 27:28.448
if you have an affair, uh,

27:28.482 --> 27:29.716
your husband gets a divorce

27:29.750 --> 27:31.384
and you don't get any money.
Correct?

27:31.419 --> 27:33.453
And how does that make me
a murder suspect?

27:33.487 --> 27:35.121
Come on.
Seriously?

27:35.156 --> 27:37.657
Lauren comes home and sees you
having sex with the trainer,

27:37.692 --> 27:38.959
and if she told her dad,

27:38.993 --> 27:41.061
you'd end up
living in the car.

27:41.095 --> 27:42.462
But if you could
get rid of Lauren,

27:42.496 --> 27:43.730
then the kidnapping
policy would kick in...

27:43.764 --> 27:45.265
Steven bought that.

27:45.299 --> 27:47.500
The policy's in your name.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.436
For tax purposes.

27:49.470 --> 27:51.526
Steven is always
trying to hide money.

27:51.606 --> 27:53.106
How'd you do it?
How'd she die?

27:53.140 --> 27:54.163
Was that always
part of your plan?

27:54.188 --> 27:55.375
I might have not

27:55.376 --> 27:58.709
gotten along with her,
but I could never hurt Lauren.

27:58.710 --> 27:59.449
I think you had
to kill her,

27:59.450 --> 28:01.717
because the policy
would kick in either way,

28:01.752 --> 28:04.287
and with Lauren dead,
there'd be no witness.

28:04.321 --> 28:06.155
I've tried to help.

28:06.190 --> 28:08.291
But I'm done.

28:08.325 --> 28:09.792
I want my lawyer.
Good.

28:09.827 --> 28:11.928
'Cause you're gonna need one.

28:13.897 --> 28:16.199
So Lauren's phone was used
to send the texts.

28:16.233 --> 28:17.500
And the stepmother
sent them.

28:17.534 --> 28:18.835
Well, it could have
been anybody.

28:18.869 --> 28:20.736
The phone was set
to turn itself on,

28:20.771 --> 28:22.238
send the text,
and then immediately

28:22.272 --> 28:24.040
turn itself off
so we couldn't trace it.

28:24.074 --> 28:25.808
That's way too
tech-savvy

28:25.843 --> 28:27.376
for Katherine.
I mean, she's the only one

28:27.411 --> 28:29.111
in the house that didn't
have a computer, right?

28:29.146 --> 28:30.346
(computer beeping)

28:30.380 --> 28:31.914
What are those?

28:31.949 --> 28:35.084
Oh, those are texts in a queue,
waiting to be sent.

28:35.118 --> 28:38.187
They're all encrypted with
Steven Frank's software.

28:38.222 --> 28:40.056
So you could just call him.

28:40.090 --> 28:42.124
Well, he's not gonna
help this time.

28:42.159 --> 28:43.960
He thinks we're
railroading his wife.

28:43.994 --> 28:45.428
Or...

28:45.462 --> 28:47.163
he's involved because
Katherine convinced him

28:47.197 --> 28:49.899
that Lauren was getting in
the way of their new marriage.

28:49.933 --> 28:53.169
Wait. You think that he
and Katherine together...?

28:54.505 --> 28:56.839
That's horrible.

28:56.874 --> 28:58.154
I mean, we're
dealing with murder

28:58.175 --> 28:59.542
and kidnapping.

28:59.576 --> 29:01.677
That's usually pretty horrible.

29:04.348 --> 29:07.283
The father and the stepmother
make sense.

29:07.317 --> 29:08.684
They were both in the house.

29:08.719 --> 29:10.219
They had access
to the phone...

29:10.254 --> 29:12.388
He's not cooperating.

29:12.422 --> 29:15.091
Listen, Bones, um...
about the money...

29:15.125 --> 29:16.425
Don't worry
about it, Booth.

29:16.460 --> 29:18.361
I'll deposit the check.

29:18.395 --> 29:19.962
No, no, no.
It's not that. It's just...

29:19.997 --> 29:23.165
You know, if the money
is ours, together,

29:23.200 --> 29:24.433
like, really ours together,

29:24.468 --> 29:26.702
do I get a say
in how it's spent?

29:26.737 --> 29:28.971
Of course.

29:30.541 --> 29:33.543
Then I'd like to give the check
to Hodgins and Angela.

29:35.312 --> 29:38.781
To Hodgins' brother,
so he can stay where he is.

29:40.450 --> 29:41.751
Look, if you don't want me to...

29:41.785 --> 29:43.786
Of course.

29:43.820 --> 29:45.354
We can do it together,

29:45.389 --> 29:46.789
like a...

29:46.823 --> 29:48.057
Ah!
Oh...

29:48.091 --> 29:49.492
You got pie on my pants.

29:49.526 --> 29:51.928
You can afford
another pair.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.267
HODGINS: <i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>because if I was here,</i>

29:58.302 --> 29:59.635
<i>I would have</i>
<i>caught this earlier.</i>

29:59.670 --> 30:01.971
Look, there was
iron oxide

30:02.005 --> 30:03.725
caught in the osteons
as well as canaliculi.

30:03.740 --> 30:05.708
It's-it's red oxide.
Rust.

30:05.742 --> 30:08.244
So whatever was used
to remove her toe was rusty.

30:08.278 --> 30:09.812
There was also
organic particulates

30:09.846 --> 30:11.180
I'm trying to I.D. now.

30:11.214 --> 30:12.582
I just...
I don't think I have enough.

30:12.616 --> 30:14.350
Well, the severed end

30:14.384 --> 30:16.018
of the toe is filthy,

30:16.053 --> 30:17.853
so you should have more
than enough there.

30:17.888 --> 30:21.257
And I'll run DNA
on whatever you find.

30:21.291 --> 30:23.793
Any news from
the beetles

30:23.827 --> 30:26.295
that you used to
deflesh the remains?

30:26.330 --> 30:27.964
Soon.

30:27.998 --> 30:29.865
I just...

30:31.735 --> 30:34.003
I-I couldn't grind them up

30:34.037 --> 30:35.671
after I came back
from seeing my brother.

30:35.706 --> 30:37.607
It's so stupid, I know...
Uh, Dr. Hodgins,

30:37.641 --> 30:38.999
do you want Mr. Fisher
to do it for you?

30:39.024 --> 30:39.909
No.

30:39.910 --> 30:41.811
No. They're mine.

30:41.845 --> 30:44.146
I'll have the results
for you soon.

30:49.219 --> 30:51.320
FISHER: I think I understand
the saw marks

30:51.355 --> 30:53.255
we found on the ulna
and the C7.

30:53.290 --> 30:55.091
They didn't do
much damage.

30:55.125 --> 30:57.159
All marks are postmortem,
made after she died.

30:57.194 --> 30:58.594
I believe
the killer did want

30:58.629 --> 31:00.396
to dismember Lauren
to dispose of her body.

31:00.430 --> 31:01.664
That's why

31:01.698 --> 31:03.065
he destroyed her teeth.

31:03.100 --> 31:04.567
To obscure her identity.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.535
But only some of her teeth.
Barely enough.

31:06.570 --> 31:07.903
He was interrupted.

31:07.938 --> 31:09.972
Look at these
hesitation marks.

31:10.007 --> 31:12.375
If we can find who interrupted him...
No.

31:12.409 --> 31:14.343
Hesitation marks
would show signs

31:14.378 --> 31:15.778
of starting and stopping.

31:15.812 --> 31:17.113
These simply stop.

31:17.147 --> 31:18.214
SAROYAN:
She had tetanus.

31:18.248 --> 31:19.348
When I saw the rust

31:19.383 --> 31:20.816
Dr. Hodgins found in the wounds,

31:20.851 --> 31:22.018
I tested the osteons.

31:22.052 --> 31:23.352
Tetanus wouldn't
kill her.

31:23.387 --> 31:24.820
No, but it made her very sick.

31:24.855 --> 31:26.088
It was a virulent strain,

31:26.123 --> 31:27.484
fast-moving,
because something else

31:27.491 --> 31:29.358
infected her in
addition to the rust.

31:29.393 --> 31:31.360
She probably had
a high fever,

31:31.395 --> 31:32.762
blood pressure, spasms...

31:32.796 --> 31:34.864
That would freak out
a first-time kidnapper.

31:34.898 --> 31:36.465
I think he tried to help her.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.601
Look what the beetles gave us.

31:42.105 --> 31:43.673
BRENNAN:
Penicillin.

31:43.707 --> 31:45.641
That is an enormous
amount to give someone.

31:45.676 --> 31:46.468
They'd have a seizure.

31:46.493 --> 31:47.610
According to her
medical records,

31:47.611 --> 31:49.311
she was allergic to penicillin.

31:49.346 --> 31:51.647
Then that amount
would killed her.

31:51.682 --> 31:53.315
But she was sick,
so whoever gave her

31:53.350 --> 31:54.784
the penicillin
wasn't trying to kill her;

31:54.818 --> 31:56.052
they wanted to save her.

31:56.086 --> 31:58.654
FISHER: Okay, I hate
to be the one

31:58.689 --> 32:01.791
in rose-colored glasses here,
but I'm going to go on record:

32:01.825 --> 32:03.325
This was an accident.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.394
Whoever killed Lauren
loved her.

32:10.545 --> 32:12.146
It wasn't a
knife or a saw.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.482
Some kind of iron clippers
were used to sever the toe.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.484
Which is why the bone
was crushed at the end.

32:16.518 --> 32:17.952
Gardening shears?

32:17.986 --> 32:20.421
No, smaller. Almost like
these nail clippers here.

32:20.455 --> 32:22.288
And the organic material
you found on the tissue?

32:22.313 --> 32:23.424
It was microscopic

32:23.425 --> 32:25.292
amounts of feces.
Cam's running it for DNA.

32:25.327 --> 32:28.229
Sounds like clippers
from someone's bathroom.

32:28.263 --> 32:29.830
Ew. I do not want to
see your bathroom.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.265
I have roommates.

32:31.299 --> 32:33.467
Let me know if you need anything else.
Yep.

32:33.502 --> 32:34.568
Oh, Dr. Hodgins...

32:34.603 --> 32:35.970
about your
brother...

32:36.004 --> 32:37.238
I'm-I'm fine, Fisher.

32:37.272 --> 32:38.806
Well, that's not true.

32:38.840 --> 32:41.008
Look, I've spent time
at the loony bin.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.776
And I was grateful for it.

32:42.811 --> 32:45.346
Because sometimes
it's the right place to be.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.516
Painful, sure.

32:48.550 --> 32:51.485
But what's worse is
when someone would look at you

32:51.520 --> 32:54.355
like you shouldn't be there.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.990
Always felt like
I'd done something wrong

32:56.024 --> 33:00.194
rather than just...
having a disease, you know.

33:02.764 --> 33:04.899
I know this sounds crazy,

33:04.933 --> 33:07.535
but you got to be happy
for him in there.

33:07.569 --> 33:10.171
Especially now
that he's found you.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.742
Trust me, he just
won the lottery.

33:17.312 --> 33:18.846
Okay, so that was all sincere,

33:18.880 --> 33:21.048
but I'm feeling a little sick
talking like that,

33:21.082 --> 33:23.784
so I'm gonna go now.

33:30.559 --> 33:33.694
I'm decrypting the texts
that were sent.

33:33.728 --> 33:35.362
It's slow
because each one

33:35.397 --> 33:37.198
used a separate
encryption.

33:37.232 --> 33:39.266
Well, we've seen
this one already.

33:39.301 --> 33:40.701
Not the whole thing.

33:40.735 --> 33:42.970
The original was run
through a Hipstashotz filter

33:43.004 --> 33:44.772
to crop this out.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.611
BOOTH:
It's a selfie.

33:50.645 --> 33:52.780
Yeah, Lauren took it
three weeks before

33:52.814 --> 33:55.015
the kidnapping,
but it was sent today.

33:55.050 --> 33:57.084
She staged her own kidnapping.
Why?

33:58.820 --> 34:00.154
Because the dog walker said

34:00.188 --> 34:02.323
that she wanted to get away
from her family.

34:02.357 --> 34:03.824
I mean, she's used
to having money.

34:03.858 --> 34:05.960
Clearly, she doesn't work.

34:05.994 --> 34:07.494
But she still had
to have an accomplice.

34:07.529 --> 34:08.829
She didn't bury herself.

34:08.862 --> 34:10.397
HODGINS:
Hey, Cam got the DNA results

34:10.431 --> 34:11.864
from the feces in the wound.

34:11.900 --> 34:14.068
It's from a dog.
The Franks' dog.

34:14.101 --> 34:16.437
It was the dog walker.
Thanks, Hodgins. Thanks.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.505
Oh-oh, uh,
one more thing, Hodgins.

34:18.540 --> 34:20.306
Listen,
about your brother...

34:20.342 --> 34:22.208
No, Booth, it's okay.
Let me finish.

34:22.244 --> 34:26.013
Bones and I, we'd like
to give you guys some money.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.250
To help you out
with your brother

34:29.284 --> 34:30.985
so he can stay where he is.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.092
Until you guys come up
with a plan, all right?

34:39.127 --> 34:41.161
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:42.797 --> 34:45.565
Wow. That's-That's
really kind of you.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.900
It is. It is.
Thank you very much.

34:47.936 --> 34:50.371
Um, I just... I can't take it.

34:51.373 --> 34:52.505
Why?

34:52.540 --> 34:54.007
I'm gonna get a loan...

34:54.042 --> 34:55.576
from a bank.

34:55.610 --> 34:57.444
Like the normal person
that I've never been.

34:57.479 --> 35:00.347
But this is
more practical.

35:00.382 --> 35:01.815
BOOTH: It's not about
being practical.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.051
It's about being responsible.

35:05.387 --> 35:07.054
Seems like pride.
Listen, I just

35:07.088 --> 35:08.422
want you both to know

35:08.456 --> 35:10.658
that Bones and I
are here for both of you

35:10.692 --> 35:12.192
if you guys ever need anything.

35:15.597 --> 35:16.964
Thank you.

35:16.998 --> 35:18.532
Thanks.
No, no, no. Oh, no!

35:18.566 --> 35:19.867
Whatever happened
to handshakes, okay?

35:19.901 --> 35:21.035
Okay, that's good.
That's enough.

35:21.069 --> 35:22.636
That's enough.
Take care.

35:22.671 --> 35:25.205
I've got to go get
the dog walker now, all right?

35:25.240 --> 35:26.907
Let's go.

35:36.284 --> 35:39.486
You tried to cut her up,
destroy her face

35:39.521 --> 35:40.988
so we wouldn't know
who she was,

35:41.022 --> 35:42.489
but you couldn't go
through with it.

35:42.524 --> 35:43.924
Because you loved her.

35:45.527 --> 35:48.329
Isn't that right?
I mean, you said that you...

35:48.363 --> 35:50.464
you used to sit
on her deck, right?

35:50.498 --> 35:52.866
Is that where you planned
the kidnapping?

35:54.703 --> 35:56.103
We tested your clippers,

35:56.137 --> 35:58.906
the ones you use
to groom the dogs.

35:58.940 --> 36:01.442
They were used
to cut off Lauren's toe.

36:01.476 --> 36:03.544
She did that herself.

36:03.578 --> 36:04.812
She said it was
the only way to convince

36:04.846 --> 36:06.413
her father she'd
been kidnapped.

36:06.448 --> 36:07.881
That was the plan.
The plan?

36:07.916 --> 36:09.650
But that was a
pretty bad plan,

36:09.684 --> 36:11.644
because you're about to
go down for murder, Buddy.

36:11.653 --> 36:13.887
I'm not a murderer.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.056
Look, her toe got infected,

36:16.091 --> 36:18.011
and she wouldn't let me
take her to the hospital,

36:18.026 --> 36:20.127
so I went to the vet's
where I work,

36:20.161 --> 36:21.628
and I took some antibiotics.

36:21.663 --> 36:22.963
Penicillin.

36:22.997 --> 36:24.431
Yeah, I took the best one.

36:24.466 --> 36:26.300
She was allergic to penicillin.

36:26.334 --> 36:29.603
I didn't know that. I swear.

36:29.637 --> 36:31.305
Look, we were gonna...

36:31.339 --> 36:32.873
we were gonna run away together.

36:32.907 --> 36:34.842
No, she was gonna run away
with someone else.

36:34.876 --> 36:37.344
She was setting you up
for the kidnapping.

36:37.379 --> 36:41.215
We decrypted the last text
her phone was going to send.

36:41.249 --> 36:45.319
It was to the police,
telling them where to find you.

36:48.690 --> 36:52.226
She said she loved me.

36:52.260 --> 36:54.128
I told her we didn't
need the money.

36:54.162 --> 36:57.164
You know, I have
a good job.

36:59.768 --> 37:02.236
I was trying to help her.

37:13.415 --> 37:18.685
♪ Light comes and goes

37:22.190 --> 37:26.860
♪ Rust turns to coal

37:30.098 --> 37:33.100

37:34.569 --> 37:38.839

I-I don't understand.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.810
Dr. Rozran called,
said Jeffrey disappeared.

37:42.844 --> 37:45.045
He thinks that Jeffrey
overheard he was being moved

37:45.079 --> 37:46.914
to another facility
and that set him off.

37:46.948 --> 37:48.749
So let the doctor and
his staff find him.

37:48.783 --> 37:50.284
They have the
experience.

37:50.318 --> 37:52.219
Yeah, but Rozran said
he only goes

37:52.253 --> 37:54.288
to a couple of places, so...
Hey, Hodgins...

37:54.322 --> 37:58.325
Hey, Angie, you said I had
a chance to love him now, right?

37:58.359 --> 38:00.994
Well, that's what I'm doing.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.330
The doctor will be there
if I need him.

38:04.732 --> 38:07.134
Call me when you get him back.

38:21.249 --> 38:23.550
<i>The Simpsons,</i> huh?
(chuckles)

38:23.585 --> 38:26.420
So what do you want
to do with the money?

38:26.454 --> 38:28.255
I know the Superball
is coming up

38:28.289 --> 38:30.491
and you've
always wanted to go.

38:30.525 --> 38:31.859
"Super Bowl."

38:31.893 --> 38:33.727
It's Super Bowl, not Superball.

38:33.761 --> 38:35.929
Anyways, listen, it's too late
in the game right now

38:35.964 --> 38:38.565
for plane tickets
and a hotel room.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.567
It would cost the whole check.

38:40.602 --> 38:43.103
That's fine with me.
You've been a good man.

38:43.137 --> 38:44.538
Well, I was...
I was thinking

38:44.572 --> 38:46.406
about something
else, about...

38:46.441 --> 38:48.976
putting it to work for us.

38:49.010 --> 38:51.311
Uh, investing it.
Yes!

38:51.346 --> 38:52.779
I'm impressed, Booth.

38:52.814 --> 38:55.215
I came up with
something really good.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.751
"Wounded Warrior Project.

38:57.785 --> 38:59.386
Empowering the wounded
and their families."

38:59.420 --> 39:00.888
Yeah, it's
a tough go after

39:00.922 --> 39:02.122
you've been injured, you know,

39:02.123 --> 39:03.224
in the service
and you come home.

39:03.225 --> 39:04.237
For the families, too.

39:04.238 --> 39:06.406
I think it's
a good investment, right?

39:14.279 --> 39:15.461
Yes.

39:15.462 --> 39:17.997
Yeah.

39:19.231 --> 39:21.966
It turns out you're very good
with your money, Booth.

39:22.001 --> 39:24.669
Cheers. Thanks, Bones.

39:41.786 --> 39:43.453
Jeffrey?

39:46.757 --> 39:48.625
Jeffrey.

39:50.294 --> 39:51.494
I brought you a coat.

39:51.529 --> 39:52.896
No, no!

39:52.930 --> 39:55.699
No! No, it was you!

39:55.733 --> 39:57.367
You're the one
that was

39:57.401 --> 39:58.835
gonna send me away!

39:58.870 --> 40:00.103
Listen, it was a mix-up, okay?

40:00.137 --> 40:01.371
I want to bring you back.

40:01.405 --> 40:02.839
You're from the Federation.

40:02.874 --> 40:04.241
You're the one

40:04.275 --> 40:05.909
that creates the static
that-that-that...

40:05.943 --> 40:08.189
I'm going to take you
back to your home.

40:08.190 --> 40:10.324
And you're never going
to have to leave there.

40:10.359 --> 40:12.093
I promise.
No.

40:12.127 --> 40:14.462
I will never trust an operative.
That's right.

40:14.496 --> 40:17.765
That's right. You-You'd never
trust an operative, okay?

40:20.502 --> 40:22.770
But you can trust your brother.

40:27.276 --> 40:30.945
I... I'm your brother, Jeffrey.

40:30.979 --> 40:33.347
I'm Jack Hodgins.

40:38.187 --> 40:40.354
Hey, you-you remember
Mom and Dad?

40:40.389 --> 40:41.889
Dr. Rozran said
that you still have

40:41.924 --> 40:43.224
a picture of them in your room.

40:43.258 --> 40:46.427
Well, here, I got one, too.
You see that?

40:48.931 --> 40:50.998
That's them.

40:51.033 --> 40:53.267
That's them.

40:56.672 --> 40:58.773
And that's me.

41:04.813 --> 41:06.514
Man, I never knew it,

41:06.548 --> 41:10.251
but I guess I've been looking
for you my whole life.

41:12.854 --> 41:15.823
To complete the picture.

41:15.857 --> 41:20.995
I can finally see past
the static, Jeffrey, like you.

41:26.368 --> 41:28.703
Let me bring you back.

41:28.737 --> 41:31.939
I promise you'll never have
to leave your home.

41:31.974 --> 41:33.808
Never.

41:42.351 --> 41:44.986
Is that...

41:45.020 --> 41:48.956
how you know
<i>20,000 Leagues</i> so well?

41:52.527 --> 41:55.196
Did he read it to you, too?

41:58.934 --> 42:02.270
Yeah, he did.

42:04.039 --> 42:06.340
Every night.

42:06.375 --> 42:08.709
Just like he must have to you.
