WEBVTT

00:01.653 --> 00:03.480
Previously onSWAT...Why are you two here so early?

00:03.524 --> 00:05.134
Wanted to get an extra workout
in case Hicks

00:05.179 --> 00:07.181
throws another fitness test
into the TLI competition.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.617
Ah, you're really going all in?Just hoping

00:08.660 --> 00:10.096
there's still time
to catch up to Street.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.012
I think I was hit, too.

00:13.403 --> 00:15.057
WENDY:
I learned that you personally

00:15.102 --> 00:16.885
lobbied for Erika to fill in

00:16.928 --> 00:18.408
on 20-Squad the day

00:18.452 --> 00:19.583
that she got killed.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.195
I can't sign off on you

00:21.237 --> 00:23.414
until you can process
this situation.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.242
You didn't say a word
the whole drive in.

00:25.286 --> 00:26.765
I'm not feeling very talkative.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.202
You've been tossing
in your sleep.

00:28.245 --> 00:29.681
Normally that means
you're nervous about something.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.117
Look, don't worry about me.

00:31.161 --> 00:33.511
Okay. I love you.

00:33.554 --> 00:35.034
I love you, too.

00:35.078 --> 00:37.732
Chris, if you took that
bullet and you went down

00:37.776 --> 00:39.908
and I lost you, I
wouldn't have recovered.

00:39.951 --> 00:42.606
I was on my way home to Molly
when I came here instead.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.609
But being with
her feels wrong.

00:44.652 --> 00:47.046
Stop.'Cause all I think about
is being with you.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.048
Leave.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.713
[muffled screaming]

01:20.515 --> 01:21.864
You don't need to do this.

01:24.170 --> 01:26.216
[gunshots]

01:27.521 --> 01:30.001
Take a look.
Tell me what you think.

01:30.045 --> 01:31.307
[gunshots]

01:32.265 --> 01:34.572
HONDO:
Decent shot, but not SWAT level.

01:34.615 --> 01:36.617
Well, she's not here
to be Annie Oakley.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.882
She's here as a tactical
emergency medical support.

01:39.924 --> 01:41.100
A TEMS officer?

01:41.144 --> 01:42.753
With us?
Is it official?

01:42.798 --> 01:45.192
Police commission
approved an evaluation period.

01:45.234 --> 01:47.932
Medically specialized
officer to join SWAT

01:47.977 --> 01:49.152
as a new life-saving component.

01:49.195 --> 01:50.805
So, she's an experiment.

01:50.848 --> 01:53.287
SWAT teams in other cities have
already seen positive results.

01:53.329 --> 01:55.766
We're lucky to get a TEMS
as qualified as Fowler.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.594
I want to start her off
on your team.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.120
HONDO:
Sir, I understand the value

02:01.164 --> 02:04.385
of adding this new element,
but we just lost an officer.

02:04.427 --> 02:07.039
The wrong addition at the wrong
time could cripple this team.

02:07.082 --> 02:08.650
We shouldn't be her tryout.

02:08.693 --> 02:10.173
Adding her gives us
zero wait time

02:10.217 --> 02:11.609
for treatment in the field.

02:11.652 --> 02:13.002
And, besides,
your team's exactly

02:13.044 --> 02:14.786
where we should be
trying her out.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.831
It'll give everyone
something new to focus on.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.181
Instead of Erika dying?

02:19.225 --> 02:21.663
If this position had
already been implemented,

02:21.705 --> 02:23.968
Erika Rogers
might still be alive.

02:25.231 --> 02:28.626
I'm sure you'll figure
out how to make it work.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.236
Yes, sir.

02:33.978 --> 02:36.329
FOWLER:
Sergeant Harrelson?

02:36.372 --> 02:37.983
Officer Nora Fowler, right?

02:38.026 --> 02:40.072
Nice to officially meet you.You as well.

02:40.115 --> 02:41.856
Head to the armory, get
your gear checked out.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.685
Additional body armor
is also available.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.076
We'll meet right after
for pre-shift briefing.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.210
Already done both, sir.Really?

02:47.253 --> 02:49.516
Sidearm and body armor
are good to go.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.344
How ready are you
to ride along with my team?

02:51.388 --> 02:53.608
100%, sir.And knowing that it
may be temporary,

02:53.651 --> 02:54.870
why'd you sign up for this?

02:54.913 --> 02:56.740
I've seen combat
as an Army medic.

02:56.784 --> 02:58.917
I was an EMT for LAFD,
finished first in my class

02:58.961 --> 03:00.745
in mountain rescue,
in deep water...

03:00.788 --> 03:02.704
So this is another notch
on your résumé, then?No.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.313
I'm looking to save lives,

03:04.358 --> 03:06.490
and I'm told that's what
SWAT does, too.

03:08.056 --> 03:08.840
Our shift's starting.

03:12.278 --> 03:14.367
Molly, hey.

03:14.411 --> 03:17.587
I, uh, thought
I saw your car outside.

03:17.632 --> 03:20.287
Yeah, I'll be
in and out all day,

03:20.329 --> 03:22.592
taking care
of a couple work things.

03:25.204 --> 03:26.989
How are you?

03:27.032 --> 03:28.598
I haven't heard much from you
the last few days.

03:28.643 --> 03:29.860
I know.

03:31.688 --> 03:33.212
We need to talk.

03:35.170 --> 03:36.302
Listen...
Jim.

03:36.346 --> 03:39.610
It's okay. I'm not mad.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.656
I know what's going on.Molly...

03:41.699 --> 03:43.918
You're distancing yourself
after losing Erika.

03:43.961 --> 03:45.573
The same way you did
when you lost your brother.

03:45.615 --> 03:48.009
It's a little more
complicated than that.

03:48.052 --> 03:49.837
I'm sure it is.

03:49.881 --> 03:52.492
I would love to be
the person you open up to,

03:52.536 --> 03:55.060
but I learned last time,
when you need space,

03:55.103 --> 03:56.497
you really need space,

03:56.539 --> 03:58.412
so I'm gonna
give you that.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.328
Consider us on a pause.

04:01.371 --> 04:03.460
And when you're ready
to have an honest conversation,

04:03.503 --> 04:04.895
call me, okay?

04:04.939 --> 04:06.201
Okay.

04:07.594 --> 04:08.856
Thanks for understanding.

04:29.485 --> 04:31.096
DEACON:
Hey. Didn't expect

04:31.139 --> 04:32.271
to see you here.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.317
You back with us?
I wish.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.927
Dr. Wendy hasn't signed off
on me returning to duty yet.

04:36.971 --> 04:38.800
She wants
one last session first.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.062
Will be good to have you back.

04:40.105 --> 04:41.889
You doing okay?

04:41.932 --> 04:43.413
Yeah, just tired.

04:43.456 --> 04:45.459
Had a late night
studying tactics and training

04:45.502 --> 04:47.764
for my final TLI interview
with Hicks,

04:47.808 --> 04:50.115
which is also today.[exhales sharply]

04:50.158 --> 04:52.466
You and Street,
you're really going all out.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.468
Bet Hicks wishes
he could choose both of you.

04:54.511 --> 04:55.685
Four months
of grinding

04:55.730 --> 04:57.471
comes down to how well
I talk today.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.821
You really want this, huh?If I'm selected,

04:59.863 --> 05:03.389
I'll be traveling, I'll be busy,
I'll be somewhere else.

05:03.432 --> 05:04.869
Everything here...

05:04.913 --> 05:06.870
Reminds you of Erika.
Yeah, I know.

05:06.915 --> 05:08.916
She was my training buddy,
my roommate.

05:08.959 --> 05:10.483
I can't let her down.

05:10.526 --> 05:13.050
I don't want this, I need it.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.225
Then you make that interview

05:14.269 --> 05:15.793
about how you'll best
represent SWAT.

05:15.836 --> 05:17.752
Hey.

05:17.795 --> 05:18.752
You're Chris Alonso,

05:18.795 --> 05:20.536
Sergeant Kay?Hi.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.322
I'm Nora Fowler, tactical medic.

05:22.365 --> 05:23.975
DEACON:
Hey, welcome.
Grab a locker.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.934
And, uh, everyone
calls me Deacon.

05:25.976 --> 05:27.283
Everybody calls me Fowler.

05:27.326 --> 05:29.110
CHRIS:
Oh, not that one.

05:29.153 --> 05:31.721
Sorry, just pick
any other open locker.

05:31.766 --> 05:32.983
No problem.

05:38.293 --> 05:39.295
She's just going through
a lot right now.

05:39.338 --> 05:40.427
FOWLER:
Yeah, I get it.

05:40.470 --> 05:43.386
You lost a teammate.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.082
I know this is a tough time
for all of you.

05:45.127 --> 05:46.737
I'm not here to get in the way
of anything.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.393
How about you?
You doing all right?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.090
Not really. No.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.571
None of us are, but, uh,

05:54.615 --> 05:57.139
just trying to help
keep everyone focused.

05:57.182 --> 05:59.968
A commanding officer of mine
once told me that pain

06:00.011 --> 06:01.795
is how
we honor the dead.

06:01.838 --> 06:04.798
Personally, I just hope I never
forget any of their faces.

06:04.841 --> 06:06.148
You don't.

06:06.190 --> 06:08.237
Maybe you can't. Or shouldn't.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.415
My little man.Oh, yeah?

06:13.459 --> 06:14.983
Let me see.

06:15.026 --> 06:17.812
Aw. He looks
just like you.

06:17.855 --> 06:20.641
This is, uh,
this is my crew.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.860
Oh, got to hold it horizontal
to get us all in.

06:22.903 --> 06:24.514
[chuckles]:
Wow. Big family.

06:24.557 --> 06:26.168
Not sure I'll get up to four
anytime soon,

06:26.211 --> 06:28.082
but congratulations,
it must be great.

06:28.125 --> 06:31.391
Well, yeah. Sometimes.[laughs]

06:38.266 --> 06:40.442
I dropped my phone
and now the screen is cracked,

06:40.487 --> 06:42.009
and now the... the...

06:42.052 --> 06:43.271
Whose number is this? Move it!

06:43.314 --> 06:45.492
Sorry, but you needto wait in line.
I need

06:45.534 --> 06:47.231
to know whose number this is
right now.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.886
Hey, buddy,
why don't you walk over here...Why don't you

06:48.930 --> 06:51.627
back off?
I'm serious.

are securing the back.

to get a read

Go.
Roger.

07:22.658 --> 07:24.007
Hondo, status?

07:24.052 --> 07:26.620
The armed suspect hasn't
made contact with us yet.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.925
What about the hostage?The security guard heard
her crying inside

07:28.970 --> 07:30.754
right after the suspect
dropped the metal screens.

07:30.798 --> 07:33.060
It's been silent
inside since.

07:33.103 --> 07:34.105
I'm gonna send you
the security footage

07:34.149 --> 07:35.932

killed the feed.

in there.

Nobody's gonna hear you,

07:54.081 --> 07:55.475
because you're gonna stay
right here.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.606
We'll radio if anyone
needs medical assistance.

07:57.651 --> 07:58.956
You understand?

08:00.435 --> 08:02.177
Move.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.749

I'll cover the windows.

25-David, only getting
one heat signature, not moving.

08:24.677 --> 08:26.418
One? There should be two.

08:26.461 --> 08:27.985
TAN:
Maybe the suspect
snuck out already.

08:28.028 --> 08:29.944
HONDO:
That or he killed the hostage
and he's in there,

Where'd the gunman go?

09:09.461 --> 09:10.679
I-I don't know.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.115
He must've left
out the back door

09:12.159 --> 09:13.552
before we got here.

09:14.509 --> 09:16.556
It's okay. Come on.

Okay, come on. Let's go.

He had a phone number, wanted
to know who it belonged to.

Did you tell him?I couldn't.

09:30.351 --> 09:31.961
I only take payments.
Kept telling him

I don't have access
to that information.HONDO: All right.

09:33.659 --> 09:36.052
It's okay. Do you remember
what that number was?

09:36.096 --> 09:39.317
He had a gun in my face.
That's all I remember.

He couldn't have got
that far.

If another woman can lead
like that, so could I.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.352
I want to win
this thing on merit,

14:36.397 --> 14:38.181
because that's what'll inspire
other female cops

14:38.225 --> 14:40.313

Well, grief's a tricky thing.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.228
I'm aware.

19:46.271 --> 19:48.273
I told him
I'd give him space.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.798
I just didn't think he'd be
so quick to want it.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.930
If you love somebody,
don't you need them

19:52.973 --> 19:54.584
there for you
when you're hurting?

19:54.627 --> 19:55.628
Of course.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.413
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

19:57.457 --> 19:59.109
nobody's worthy of my daughter.

19:59.153 --> 20:00.460
[chuckles]

20:00.502 --> 20:02.679
I'm sure that's probably
not helpful,

20:02.722 --> 20:05.160
but you listen to me.

20:05.203 --> 20:07.683
You've always had
great instincts,

20:07.728 --> 20:10.164
so you trust that.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.253
Okay?

20:12.298 --> 20:15.823
Um, Chris will probably be done
with Dr. Wendy pretty soon,

20:15.865 --> 20:17.432
and, you know,
maybe she'll have a better take

20:17.477 --> 20:18.868
on all this than me.

20:20.522 --> 20:21.611
Okay.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.179
Thanks, Dad.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.311
I appreciate you trying.

20:26.355 --> 20:27.964
Yeah.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.839
I didn't do anything to her.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.232
Come on, Phil.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.972
Prisons are full of people
that didn't do anything,

20:36.017 --> 20:37.323
until a jury said they did.

20:37.365 --> 20:38.759
She's alive.

20:38.801 --> 20:40.630
[loud thud]

20:40.673 --> 20:42.022
You're wasting time.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.807
If she's alive,
then where is she?

20:44.852 --> 20:46.809
I was trying
to find her.

20:46.854 --> 20:51.118
This guy she worked with,
Joe Falcone, he took her.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.119
Why do you think that?

20:52.163 --> 20:53.469
'Cause he's a creep.

20:53.512 --> 20:55.297
Joe was always sniffing
around Jess,

20:55.340 --> 20:56.603
even before the divorce.

20:56.645 --> 20:58.038
You think it's a coincidence
he was at her house

20:58.082 --> 20:59.345
the day she disappeared?

20:59.387 --> 21:01.346
Come on, I just saw him
an hour ago

21:01.390 --> 21:02.652
on the doorbell footage.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.958
Doesn't prove anything.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.351
Except he's
a creep.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.917
If you get my phone,
I can prove it.

21:07.961 --> 21:10.834
Jess called me this morning
from a number

21:10.877 --> 21:11.965
I didn't recognize.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.707
That's why I was
at the wireless store,

21:13.750 --> 21:15.317
to find out whose number it was.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.405
So, what, you're saying that
she called you from Joe's phone?

21:17.450 --> 21:19.625
And this voice message
Jess left you,

21:19.669 --> 21:20.800
it's gonna verify
your story?

21:20.844 --> 21:22.237
It wasn't a message.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.804
We talked for, like,
five seconds.

21:23.846 --> 21:25.284
I asked her
where she was,

21:25.326 --> 21:26.807
and he must have snatched
the phone,

21:26.849 --> 21:28.068
because she screamed
and the call cut off.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.069
And we're just supposed

21:29.113 --> 21:31.159
to take your
word for it?

21:31.201 --> 21:32.421
Phil...

21:32.464 --> 21:34.075
help me understand
something here.

21:34.117 --> 21:35.816
If you had this proof,
why didn't you

21:35.858 --> 21:37.251
just call 911?Because the second

21:37.296 --> 21:39.384
a woman goes missing,
you guys automatically want

21:39.427 --> 21:41.473
to pin it on the husband.BURROWS:
Ex-husband.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.563
And everything
points to you.

21:43.605 --> 21:46.347
Are you even looking
at other suspects?

21:46.392 --> 21:48.394
Oh, my God.

21:48.436 --> 21:49.916
See?

21:49.960 --> 21:51.919
You want to keep me
another ten hours?

21:51.961 --> 21:54.095
Because that is time
Jess doesn't have.

21:54.137 --> 21:56.489
Joe knows she called me
this morning.

21:56.531 --> 21:58.925
Check my phone.
Please.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.013
Jess needs help.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.194
Commander?

22:07.238 --> 22:09.632
Can I talk to you about
my involvement on 20-Squad?

22:11.329 --> 22:13.114
I don't think
it's the right fit.

22:13.156 --> 22:15.898
And you came to this conclusion
after a few hours?

22:15.942 --> 22:18.205
It's not what
I signed up for, sir.

22:18.249 --> 22:20.425
Well, what is it
you signed up for?

22:20.469 --> 22:22.297
Not to be left on the sideline.

22:22.340 --> 22:24.125
Right now it feels
like I'm only here

22:24.167 --> 22:27.258
so your department can check
whatever box needed checking.

22:27.301 --> 22:30.522
Well, first off,
I don't play politics.

22:30.566 --> 22:33.916
And secondly,
I handpicked you for this team

22:33.961 --> 22:35.962
to help them through all this,

22:36.006 --> 22:37.529
because I know
you can relate

22:37.573 --> 22:40.096
to how they're
feeling right now.

22:40.141 --> 22:42.796
I read what happened
to you overseas.

22:42.838 --> 22:45.364
Be patient.
Give it time.

22:45.406 --> 22:49.019
If things don't improve,
I'll assign you to another team.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.588
Phil Winter's phone record
indicates that he received

22:53.633 --> 22:55.590
an incoming call at
8:48 this morning.

22:55.634 --> 22:58.246
And it only lasted 14 seconds.

22:58.288 --> 23:00.248
I think the guy's
telling the truth.

23:00.290 --> 23:02.381
Which means Jess is out
there somewhere alive.

23:02.423 --> 23:04.644
Are there any other leads
on Joe Falcone's whereabouts?

23:04.686 --> 23:06.993
I just touched base
with Miami-Dade PD.

23:07.037 --> 23:09.257
Falcone moved here in August
from Florida.

23:09.299 --> 23:11.214
HONDO: The Sunshine State.TAN: Yeah, sounds like the guy

23:11.259 --> 23:12.781
really is a creep--
one of his coworkers down there

23:12.826 --> 23:14.348
filed two stalker complaints.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.220
She ultimately had to geta restraining order.All right.

23:16.263 --> 23:19.484
The last time Falcone's cell
pinged a tower was way out here,

23:19.528 --> 23:21.008
north of the city.

23:21.050 --> 23:22.791
That's a big area to canvass.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.794
His DMV records
list two addresses:

23:24.837 --> 23:26.186
one in the city...

23:26.230 --> 23:27.971
and the other
right near that last ping.

23:28.015 --> 23:30.583
That's the middle
of the desert.

23:42.898 --> 23:44.814
[gasps]

23:44.857 --> 23:46.642
[shudders]

23:46.685 --> 23:48.035
You need to eat.

23:48.077 --> 23:50.603
I don't want you
starving yourself.

23:53.997 --> 23:56.346
I brought you here
to make you happy.

23:56.391 --> 23:59.349
You said your ex never did
anything like that for you.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.352
I won't call him again.

24:01.395 --> 24:04.137
I'm so good to you.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.444
Why can't you see that?

24:06.488 --> 24:09.143
I do see it, Joe.

24:11.579 --> 24:13.973
But I need to go home now, Joe.

24:16.063 --> 24:18.413
When can I go home?You made me feel

24:18.457 --> 24:19.980
like you wanted to be with me,

24:20.022 --> 24:22.765
but it's still him,
isn't it? Isn't it?!

24:22.808 --> 24:25.115
I just wantto go home, please.Too late, Jess!

24:25.159 --> 24:26.638
[shuddering]

24:26.682 --> 24:27.769
[alarm blaring]

24:27.814 --> 24:29.816
[yells]

24:32.078 --> 24:34.080
[sobbing]Quiet!

24:49.488 --> 24:51.271
No sign of movement.

24:51.315 --> 24:52.142
Windows and doors

24:52.185 --> 24:53.403
on the west
and east sides.

24:55.493 --> 24:56.885
That's Joe Falcone's car.

24:56.930 --> 24:59.410
Looks like our best
approach is the one-side.

24:59.453 --> 25:00.541
All right, Tan,
jump back in Betty.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.500
Lead us to the one-side
on my call.

25:01.542 --> 25:02.761
Form a stick.

25:02.805 --> 25:04.414
We enter on the porch
toward the front door.

25:04.459 --> 25:05.590
Fowler, stay back
until we're clear.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.461
I'm trained to go
into hostile situations.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.071
Yeah, well,
you haven't trained with us.

25:09.115 --> 25:10.682
If there's a medical situation,
you'll come in right away.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.208
Let's move.

25:20.344 --> 25:21.650
Street, check the three-side.

25:24.392 --> 25:25.523
LAPD!

25:25.567 --> 25:27.613
Search warrant!
Open up!

25:27.655 --> 25:28.701
Tan, door.

25:32.226 --> 25:33.618
LAPD!

25:33.662 --> 25:34.923
LAPD!

25:35.837 --> 25:37.536
HONDO:
Kitchen clear!

25:40.494 --> 25:41.887
Bedroom clear!

25:41.931 --> 25:43.932
Food's warm.
Stove's still on.

25:43.977 --> 25:45.413
DEACON:
Lights left on.

25:45.455 --> 25:46.326
Someone just left.

25:46.369 --> 25:48.241
We're too late?[gunshot]

25:48.285 --> 25:50.461
That's not good.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.201
They're out in the desert.

25:56.858 --> 25:57.947
This is 20-David.
I need Airship 20 to land.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.209
I need my guys' eyes in the air.

25:59.252 --> 26:00.645
We found tire tracks
leading out to the desert,

26:00.689 --> 26:02.734
headed east,
same direction as the gunshot.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.911
All right. We'll follow
the tracks in the SWAT SUVs. Go.

26:04.953 --> 26:06.346
Where are the checkpoints?

26:06.390 --> 26:08.567
Local PD's got roadblocks,
set up here and here.

26:08.609 --> 26:12.614
HONDO:
All right, let's expand it
to a 15-mile blockade.

26:12.657 --> 26:15.269
Block exit ramps from
Route 15 to the east of the 10.

26:15.311 --> 26:17.096
Hop on that bird and check
the surrounding area.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.663
Relay if you see anything.

26:20.273 --> 26:21.188
Hey. Hey!

26:21.230 --> 26:22.492
Where you going?

26:22.537 --> 26:24.104
Two more eyes can't hurt
if you want to find her.

26:24.146 --> 26:27.586
Okay, but you stay close to me.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.461
I'm good. Let's go.

26:43.297 --> 26:45.255
HONDO:
Stop. Stop.

26:50.086 --> 26:51.566
STREET:
What do you got, boss?

26:51.609 --> 26:53.133
Suspect stopped here.

26:54.176 --> 26:57.397
And then he backed up,
and then he kept going.

26:57.441 --> 26:58.311
Stopped here for what?

26:59.138 --> 27:01.228
To get rid of evidence.

27:01.270 --> 27:03.664
Let's spread out.
Grid search up the hill.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.232
Suspect could've been looking
for a place to dump her body.

27:14.284 --> 27:16.025
Nothing on his property.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.461
We're heading east
to search the desert.

27:18.506 --> 27:20.376
HONDO:
Roger that, Deac.

27:25.991 --> 27:28.124
Hold on. I might have something.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.693
Vehicle spotted, two o'clock!

27:33.433 --> 27:34.695
Head towards that pickup truck.

27:36.436 --> 27:37.829
Let's head towards the road.

27:37.873 --> 27:39.482
Might find something
over there.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.050
TAN:
Wait.

27:42.095 --> 27:43.704
Shell casing.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.924
Tan, Tan.
Drag marks.

27:48.491 --> 27:50.277
[thumping]

27:50.319 --> 27:53.236
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Something's hollow under here.

27:53.279 --> 27:55.717
Let's get it off.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.587
[both straining]

27:59.241 --> 28:00.982
26-David,

28:01.027 --> 28:03.942
we might've located the victim
down an old mine shaft.

28:03.986 --> 28:06.728
Hey, Jess!
Can you hear us?Jess!

28:06.771 --> 28:08.250
Jess Winter!

28:08.295 --> 28:10.123
HONDO:
Get the gear. I'm going down.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.563
Lower us down
so I can see inside.

28:25.747 --> 28:27.140
That's our guy. That's Falcone.

28:27.182 --> 28:29.358
No one in the passenger seat.
He's alone.

28:35.496 --> 28:36.452
Gun![two gunshots]

28:36.497 --> 28:38.673
Hold on. 30-David.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.195
ID'd Falcone in the truck.
We're taking fire.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.458
HONDO:
Are you good?

28:41.501 --> 28:42.676
Yeah, yeah,
we're good.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.287
FOWLER:
All your assessment gear,

28:44.330 --> 28:46.288
everything you
need is in here.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.942
All right, I got it.
If she's alive,

28:47.987 --> 28:49.423
I'll treat
the bullet wound first,

28:49.465 --> 28:50.771
stabilize her neck,
put her on the litter,

28:50.816 --> 28:52.469
and get her up to you.

28:52.512 --> 28:53.992
Don't worry about stabilizing--
if there's a spinal injury,

28:54.036 --> 28:55.298
it's already done.
What I'm worried about

28:55.342 --> 28:57.125
is internal bleeding
and extraction time.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.172
She'll be in shock.
Got to get her out as
quickly as possible.

28:59.214 --> 29:01.565
All right, stay on comms.
Let's go, Street.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.307
[panting]

29:05.352 --> 29:06.832
Get me down there.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.789
[whirring]

29:08.834 --> 29:11.357
Looks like her clothes
got caught up on these planks.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.795
Might've softened her fall.

29:13.838 --> 29:15.884
FOWLER:
Hopefully it kept her alive.

29:21.846 --> 29:23.718
TAN:
How you doing, boss?

29:23.761 --> 29:26.112
I'm good.
I'm at the bottom.

29:26.154 --> 29:27.678
Lower down
a little more slack for me.

29:27.721 --> 29:29.810
[whirring]

29:33.075 --> 29:34.423
Jess.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.470
Jess, can you hear me?

29:37.688 --> 29:39.865
Jess, can you hear me?

29:43.564 --> 29:44.694
She's alive.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.522
She's got
a strong carotid pulse,

29:46.567 --> 29:47.960
but her breathing is slow.

29:48.002 --> 29:50.222
I also see multiple
abrasions on her torso,

29:50.266 --> 29:52.224
and her shirt's
covered in blood.
