psychologist

09:20.647 --> 09:23.171

09:28.742 --> 09:30.700
Nice. Nice....has a six-month
waiting list.

09:30.744 --> 09:34.008
But I-- there was
a cancellation today.

09:34.051 --> 09:36.358
So, I know how important
graduation is,

09:36.401 --> 09:40.144

of being a mess.

really good at that.

me more than anything,

10:42.250 --> 10:43.947

thing in the world

cousin, isn't it?

asking him questions

11:32.604 --> 11:33.780

on his own volition.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.524

from where Tyson dealt,

11:39.568 --> 11:41.222
and this happened the day
before Tyson disappeared.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.397
There could be a connection.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.746
What?

the Parker case

11:45.966 --> 11:48.316

for that Murphy chick.

30:23.256 --> 30:24.257
I think we might be.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.780
GLORIA:
Step away from the car.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.609
I'm not moving
from the-the car.

30:32.265 --> 30:33.570
[slurps]

30:36.095 --> 30:37.487
It's getting late.
We should probably head back.

30:37.531 --> 30:39.228
No, no, no. Hang on.

30:39.272 --> 30:40.490
[clinking]

30:40.534 --> 30:42.057
What can I get for you?

30:42.101 --> 30:44.886
Food. What do you have?

30:44.930 --> 30:46.409
All the food is on the buffet.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.194
You brought me to a buffet?

30:48.237 --> 30:49.804
You said alcohol.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.066
And now I'm hungry.

30:53.068 --> 30:54.200
Do you need some help?

30:54.243 --> 30:57.246
No.
No, ma'am. No.

31:00.119 --> 31:03.122
Murph, your cane.I can hear
the ch-china.

31:07.648 --> 31:10.085
Excuse me, sorry.

31:18.137 --> 31:19.486
These are
mashed potatoes, right?

31:19.529 --> 31:20.922
Yes, dear.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.272
Good day.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.187
Try these?

31:25.231 --> 31:26.797
This is good.

[women murmuring]

31:48.689 --> 31:49.646
Oh, seriously?

you didn't get any.

to call it a day, huh?

32:06.315 --> 32:09.101
Uh, we're not leaving.Oh, look...

32:09.144 --> 32:11.103
Don't touch me.Dude, she said
don't touch her, all right?

Oh. Now would you...?Don't touch me!

Uh, they're
pressing charges.

32:30.470 --> 32:33.734
For what? Pushing a guy?
Calm down.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.605
You think everyone
around you is impossible,

32:35.649 --> 32:37.738
but maybe, just maybe
you're the impossible one.

32:39.479 --> 32:41.176
Oh.Now I'm going to jail

32:41.220 --> 32:43.004
because you refuse to
let anyone help you.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.832
Relax. You're
being dramatic, okay?

32:44.875 --> 32:46.660
They'll probably let you off
with a warning or something.

32:46.703 --> 32:49.097
No, they won't.

32:58.846 --> 33:00.804
Cocaine possession.Mm-hmm.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.241
I stole a car once.

33:02.284 --> 33:03.938
Wow, all this talk
about keeping me safe,

33:03.982 --> 33:06.810
and the whole time, I was on
the road with a criminal. Nice.

33:06.854 --> 33:09.683
And that's why this is a
bigger deal than it is, okay?

33:09.726 --> 33:12.642
You might have to take that
Uber back to Chicago after all.

33:12.686 --> 33:15.210
Do you have any idea
how expensive that would be?

Ma'am?Thank God.
Thank God you're here.

33:26.961 --> 33:28.702
Where-where are you?

33:28.745 --> 33:30.704
I'm actually in the middle
of questioning the manager here.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.445
I'll get to you in a second.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.360
You mean, um,

33:34.403 --> 33:37.537
the manager who didn't
offer me a braille menu?

33:37.580 --> 33:40.888
The manager whose buffet
isn't handicap accessible?

33:40.931 --> 33:43.673
Are you talking
about the manager who

33:43.717 --> 33:46.067
assaulted me
because I was unable

33:46.111 --> 33:49.679
to navigate the buffet
due to my disability?

we got a little testy here.

on his way here, so...

any of your questions, okay?

34:32.157 --> 34:37.249
I mean, she's-she's rude,
selfish, sarcastic,

34:37.292 --> 34:40.861
but under all that,
she's...

34:42.254 --> 34:43.777
...well, that.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.779
I'm not following.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.781
Edward's perfect.

Well, Murphy isn't.

more than anything.

that eventually, I'm gonna
