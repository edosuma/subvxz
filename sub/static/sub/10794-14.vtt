WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:05.073
RUSH: I may be on
 the verge of discovering

00:05.106 --> 00:07.541
the true nature of
 Destiny's mission.

00:08.676 --> 00:12.146
ELI: You've had
 control of this ship
 the whole time!

00:12.180 --> 00:13.814
Why wouldn't you
 tell anyone?

00:13.847 --> 00:17.651
The Lucian Alliance
 is planning an attack
 on Earth.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.221
YOUNG: I killed Riley.
 I suffocated him
 with my own hands.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.756
You are a good commander.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.326
YOUNG: There is no mission
 other than getting
 these people home.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.228
RUSH: It was never about
 going home,

00:27.261 --> 00:28.662
it's about getting us
 to where we're going.

00:28.696 --> 00:32.066
That is the mission.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.401
GREER: And if ever you
 were gonna have

00:33.434 --> 00:35.836
a chance with anyone,
 this is probably it.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.838
RUSH: I've thought
 a lot about you.

00:37.871 --> 00:38.906
YOUNG: We need to talk.

00:38.939 --> 00:39.940
I'm sorry?

00:39.973 --> 00:41.275
Where's Ginn?
 She's on Earth.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.843
Ginn told Homeworld Command

00:42.876 --> 00:45.079
that Simeon had intelligence
 about an attack

00:45.113 --> 00:46.714
that was being
 planned against Earth.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.382
Then he killed Ginn.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.350
BARNES: Amanda Perry is dead.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.752
(SCREAMING)

00:51.785 --> 00:52.920
TELFORD:
There's been an attack.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.689
We think there
might be a bomb onboard,
as yet unexploded.

00:55.723 --> 00:56.590
VARRO: I think I can help.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.892
I can tell you how
 to defuse that bomb.

00:58.926 --> 00:59.793
GREER: Have you
 heard anything?

00:59.827 --> 01:00.828
Not yet.

01:05.132 --> 01:09.103
Day six.
 Shifts running continuously
 around the clock,

01:09.137 --> 01:12.673
just like you ordered,
 but still no connection.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.243
(DOOR BUZZES OPEN)

01:15.276 --> 01:16.144
I'm up next.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.715
You okay?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.451
Yeah. Just...
 Leg fell asleep.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.422
Okay.

01:38.366 --> 01:39.933
Checkmate.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.472
Again.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.840
You might want to put
 a bit of effort
 into it this time.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.177
Doesn't it bother you?

01:49.210 --> 01:50.978
We don't know
 if that bomb was
 defused in time.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.447
You're worried
 about your mom.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.151
I'm worried about everyone.

02:00.988 --> 02:03.191
So, again?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.358
(CHUCKLES)

02:04.392 --> 02:07.060
Come on,
 take your mind off it
 for half an hour or so.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.729
Couple of minutes,
 the way you're playing.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.201
VOLKER:
 Also Sprach Zarathustra.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.805
It's the theme from
 2001: A Space Odyssey.

02:17.838 --> 02:18.939
So why didn't
 you just say that?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.208
Because that's not
 what it's called.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.042
It's called
 Also Sprach Zarathustra,

02:22.075 --> 02:23.477
Thus Spoke Zarathustra.
 It's by Strauss.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.012
But nobody knows it
 by that name,

02:25.045 --> 02:26.146
so why not
 just say the name
 people know about?

02:26.180 --> 02:27.981
Look, you asked me
what my favorite
piece of music was,

02:28.015 --> 02:28.849
and I'm telling you.
 That's what it is.

02:28.882 --> 02:29.950
Yeah, I'm just saying...

02:29.983 --> 02:32.220
It's the one piece
that reminds me
of the very moment

02:32.253 --> 02:33.887
I wanted to be
 an astrophysicist.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.423
Right, when you saw 2001?

02:36.857 --> 02:38.058
Yes.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.393
That's my point.
 That people know that song

02:39.427 --> 02:40.561
only because of the movie.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.230
Song? It's not
 a song, Brody.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.163
Oh, it's not a song now?

02:46.400 --> 02:48.236
You all right?

02:48.269 --> 02:52.139
Yes. It's you.
You get me wound up
with your stupid...

02:52.172 --> 02:52.940
Hey, hey...

02:55.543 --> 02:57.177
Colonel Young,
this is Brody. Come in.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.147
YOUNG: Go ahead.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.082
I think we have
 a connection.

03:07.455 --> 03:10.258
You're aboard the Destiny.
I'm Colonel Young.
Who are you?

03:13.561 --> 03:14.962
I'm Ginn.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.298
What happened?

03:30.110 --> 03:33.113
GINN: I had some
 trouble breathing,
 at first.

03:33.146 --> 03:36.083
Dr. Perry's condition
was difficult to adjust to.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.520
Eli.
ELI: Ginn?

03:39.553 --> 03:41.955
It's you? Really?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.193
What happened, then?

03:46.226 --> 03:48.195
Your people from
 Homeworld Security

03:48.228 --> 03:51.098
asked me questions
about the Lucian Alliance.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.000
I answered as best
 I could, and then...

03:54.502 --> 03:56.069
Nothing.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.372
(SCOFFS) Nothing?

03:58.406 --> 03:59.940
GINN: It's strange.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.242
One moment I was
 answering questions,

04:02.276 --> 04:04.412
and the next thing I knew,
 I was sitting here.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.223
What happened?

04:16.255 --> 04:18.291
Why didn't I return
 to my own body?

04:21.329 --> 04:26.467
Ginn, while you were
connected to Dr. Perry,

04:26.500 --> 04:30.971
one of your people,
 Simeon, he killed you.

04:31.004 --> 04:35.042
And we received confirmation
 that Dr. Perry died
 on Earth as well.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.147
That can't be true.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.388
Then, how am I still here?

04:56.229 --> 05:00.000
Heya, T.J. You burning
 the midnight oil?

05:00.033 --> 05:02.703
Well, since Rush broke
 Destiny's master code,

05:02.736 --> 05:05.373
all these
 Ancient medical devices
 are now accessible to us,

05:05.406 --> 05:08.141
so I'm kind of taking
 a crash course on them,

05:08.175 --> 05:10.077
although it would
 help if I were fluent
 in Ancient...

05:11.379 --> 05:12.713
You okay?

05:12.746 --> 05:18.018
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling
a little under the weather,
trouble sleeping.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.487
I was wondering if you
 could give me something.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.321
A good night's sleep
 would do me wonders.

05:21.355 --> 05:27.060
Yeah, yeah, sure, hang on.
 I got just the thing.
 Let's see.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.296
Here. Just gonna take this,
 mix it with water,

05:29.329 --> 05:33.401
give it about
 a half hour or so
 and it'll calm you down,

05:33.434 --> 05:34.334
help you relax,
and maybe...

05:34.368 --> 05:35.369
(THUDDING)

05:39.707 --> 05:41.542
It doesn't make any sense.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.412
Well, obviously
we don't know as much about
the stones as we thought.

05:46.414 --> 05:51.151
Look, Ginn was...
 Ginn was murdered.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.087
So, therefore,
 the connection wasn't
 properly severed

05:54.121 --> 05:56.557
with the
 communication device.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.259
Now perhaps
 her consciousness
 became displaced.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.061
Displaced?

06:01.094 --> 06:03.964
Floating around,
 like a radio signal?

06:05.466 --> 06:08.101
Chloe just
 happened to be the one
 to tune into it.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.103
SCOTT: But why her?

06:10.137 --> 06:12.105
We've had people
on stone duty around
the clock for days now.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.374
Why didn't any of them
 connect with Ginn?

06:14.408 --> 06:16.477
Well, perhaps because
 Chloe was the only one
 to fall asleep.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.014
Her consciousness
relaxed just enough

06:21.048 --> 06:23.350
to allow an opening
for a connection.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.620
Well, I don't know, Colonel.
 It's just conjecture
 at this point.

06:26.654 --> 06:29.457
I'm sorry,
 but the bigger question
 here is,

06:29.490 --> 06:33.260
if Ginn is in Chloe's body,
 whose body is Chloe
 connected to?

06:38.165 --> 06:40.000
How long have you
been feeling like this?

06:40.501 --> 06:41.635
A few days now.

06:41.669 --> 06:42.670
"Few" meaning...

06:43.571 --> 06:45.238
A week, maybe two.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.040
(AIR RELEASING)

06:47.074 --> 06:48.075
Maybe a month.

06:54.615 --> 06:59.219
Your blood pressure's high.
176 over 110.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.389
I used to take
 blood pressure pills.
 Hypertension.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.658
I ran out shortly
 after we got to Destiny.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.494
Why didn't you tell me?

07:06.527 --> 07:07.661
Well, there's nothing
 you could do about it.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.329
It's not like
 you could write me
 another prescription.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.264
No, I have medicinals
 that could help.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.501
Tea leaves
 have been effective in
 improving circulation...

07:13.534 --> 07:16.136
T.J., I was feeling fine.
 I didn't think
 it was a problem.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.405
Hypertension is
 often symptomless
 but dangerous.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.473
Didn't your doctor
 tell you this?

07:21.542 --> 07:24.411
Okay. Look, one of
these Ancient machines

07:24.444 --> 07:26.413
is used for diagnostics,
 including blood work,

07:26.446 --> 07:27.681
so I'm going
to run a few tests.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.183
I just think
 a good night's sleep
 is all I'm going to need.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.185
Probably. Let's just
 be sure, okay?

07:45.566 --> 07:46.567
Nothing.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.703
So, whoever Chloe
 is connected to,

07:49.737 --> 07:51.138
they're definitely
 not on Earth.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.144
VOLKER: Wow,
 look at that face.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.812
That can only mean
 good news, right?

08:00.648 --> 08:02.249
May I come in?

08:04.685 --> 08:05.686
Yeah.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.564
Your kidneys are failing.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.233
End-stage renal disease.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.435
All of them?

08:24.204 --> 08:27.174
Kidney disease tends
 to attack both kidneys
 at the same time.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.443
Okay.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.849
Okay, can we do anything?
 Any of your medicinals...

08:37.885 --> 08:39.587
No.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.590
The problem
 with kidney disease is,

08:42.623 --> 08:44.157
by the time
 you have symptoms,

08:44.191 --> 08:46.694
it's already
 too far advanced.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.630
On Earth, the next step
 would be dialysis.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.700
Um...

08:52.733 --> 08:56.436
The machines
 in the infirmary,
 do any of them...

08:56.469 --> 09:00.941
No. I already checked.
 It's mostly testing
 equipment,

09:00.974 --> 09:05.312
some devices
 for use during surgery,
 but nothing for dialysis.

09:07.615 --> 09:13.220
The only other
 option for treatment
 would be a transplant.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.591
GINN: Rush killed him?

09:17.625 --> 09:21.461
Chased him halfway
across a desert planet.
I wanted to go, too, but...

09:21.494 --> 09:24.464
No, I'm glad you didn't.
 I'd hate to see you
 get hurt.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.834
Hey, I wasn't
 going to get hurt.

09:27.835 --> 09:30.804
I was just so...

09:30.838 --> 09:34.341
I had to do something.
 You know, after what
 he did, I wasn't...

09:40.580 --> 09:43.917
Whoa, no...
It's just...

09:47.320 --> 09:49.489
I'm sorry. I...

09:49.522 --> 09:52.259
No. No, no,
 no, no, no, no.
 It's okay.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.963
Believe me,
 there's nothing more

09:55.996 --> 10:00.801
I want to do right now
 than kiss you.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.435
What's going
 to happen to me?

10:02.469 --> 10:05.706
Is there any way
 that I can get back
 into my own body?

10:11.845 --> 10:12.880
After you...

10:17.818 --> 10:19.953
The next planet
 we stopped at,

10:22.990 --> 10:23.957
it was beautiful.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.229
We buried your body there.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.901
Had a memorial service.
It was...

10:35.836 --> 10:38.238
Then, where will
 I return to?

10:39.406 --> 10:41.441
I don't know.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.544
I mean, we don't even know
 who Chloe is connected
 to on the other end,

10:44.577 --> 10:47.014
if she's safe.

10:47.047 --> 10:50.250
I've been trying
 to remember more,
 but I just can't...

10:51.518 --> 10:52.485
(GASPING)

10:52.519 --> 10:53.821
What? What's wrong?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.455
Ginn? Ginn!

10:55.488 --> 10:56.589
(CHOKING)

10:58.591 --> 11:00.994
Help! Somebody help!

11:02.662 --> 11:04.331
Hey, hey...

11:04.364 --> 11:05.432
(COUGHING)

11:06.900 --> 11:09.002
(HYPERVENTILATING)

11:09.036 --> 11:10.037
You all right?

11:12.906 --> 11:13.941
What just happened?

11:17.577 --> 11:18.578
I don't know.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.719
I'll be right back.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.591
As far as I can tell,
 there's nothing
 physically wrong with her.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.093
So, do you have any
 idea what caused it?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.494
I have no idea.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.864
It was weird.
 We were just talking

11:36.897 --> 11:38.331
and then suddenly,
she was choking.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.767
No reason.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.736
Ginn was strangled
 by Simeon.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.338
Now, brain function
 is really just

11:45.372 --> 11:47.340
a series of
 electrical signals.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.810
Energy which is
 no doubt the foundation
 of how the stones work.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.047
Now, she was murdered
 before she was disconnected.

11:54.081 --> 11:57.117
So, what, the energy
 was disrupted,

11:57.150 --> 11:58.952
resulting in
some kind of glitch

11:58.986 --> 12:01.054
that made her
 replay the event?

12:01.088 --> 12:03.556
Do you think we should
 disconnect the stone?

12:03.590 --> 12:05.358
If we disconnect,
 who knows what'll happen
 to Ginn?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.427
We may not be able
to get her back.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.629
Eli, if she has
 another attack,
 Chloe could be harmed.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.132
But T.J.
 just said there's nothing
 physically wrong with her.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.801
I just think that
 we should study this,

12:13.834 --> 12:15.936
see if there's some way
that we can save Ginn

12:15.969 --> 12:17.971
without harming
 either of them.

12:18.005 --> 12:18.939
RUSH: I agree.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.708
It warrants further study.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.444
All right,
 well, let's go ahead.
 We'll keep an eye on her.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.914
Hopefully, this is
 a one-time event.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.982
Sir, there's something else
 I need to talk to you about.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.987
Transplant? How soon?

12:35.488 --> 12:36.556
As soon as possible.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.524
Well, we can't
 connect to Earth,

12:37.557 --> 12:39.793
so using the stones
 to bring a doctor onboard

12:39.827 --> 12:40.828
is out of the question.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.129
Yes, sir.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.064
Given the obvious
 limitations of this ship,

12:44.097 --> 12:46.633
is that type of surgery
even possible here?

12:46.666 --> 12:48.501
We have access to
 more Ancient devices

12:48.535 --> 12:50.770
as well as a pretty
 extensive medical database

12:50.804 --> 12:52.172
since Rush
 cracked the code.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.907
YOUNG: Anything in there
 about organ transplants?

12:53.941 --> 12:55.608
JOHANSEN: (EXHALES)
Probably, I don't know.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.510
I've just begun to
 search through it all.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.447
All right, well,
 sounds like you've got
 to get back at it.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.583
Sir, listen, in order
 to do this procedure,

13:03.616 --> 13:05.785
we're going to need
 a compatible donor.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.620
Well, you have the records
 of everybody's blood type.

13:07.654 --> 13:10.390
We're also going to
 need to tissue-type
 to get a thorough match.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.025
Okay.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.093
It's going to be
 extremely difficult.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.863
There's not that many people
 on board this ship.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.131
To get an adequate match,
 it's a long shot at best.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.168
T.J., let's just...
First things first.
Start testing.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.970
Let's see if this
 is even possible.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.672
Yes, sir.
 Okay.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.075
(SIGHS)

13:29.843 --> 13:31.711
SCOTT: T.J.?

13:31.744 --> 13:34.047
JOHANSEN: Oh, hey,
 thanks for coming.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.782
I cross-checked
blood types.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.550
There's 18 people
on board the ship

13:37.584 --> 13:38.852
who are compatible
 with Dr. Volker.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.055
Among them are you two.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.556
It's not too complicated.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.724
I just need to draw
 some blood if that's okay.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.126
Let's do it.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.660
You first?

13:47.694 --> 13:50.563
I'm a Marine.
 We're always first.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.764
(JOHANSEN CHUCKLES)

13:53.733 --> 13:57.837
So, what are
 the chances of getting
 a good match here?

13:57.871 --> 13:59.139
Well, it's a matter
 of degrees.

13:59.172 --> 14:03.210
We're looking for
certain genetic markers
on white blood cells.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.045
No one on board the ship
 is related to him,

14:05.078 --> 14:06.914
so that rules out
 the best possible match,

14:06.947 --> 14:10.050
but hopefully we can
 find one close enough

14:10.083 --> 14:11.184
that warrants
 doing the transplant.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.458
T.J., you're gonna be okay.
 You can do this.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.462
Yeah, piece of cake.

14:24.631 --> 14:25.865
How's it going?

14:25.899 --> 14:29.602
Well, Rush has
 some ideas, but we're
 still working on it.

14:30.737 --> 14:31.538
How are you doing?

14:32.739 --> 14:36.209
I feel different.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.612
It's not like
 the last time I used
 the communication stones.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.983
Well, what's different?
I mean, aside from
the choking part.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.121
Something just
 doesn't feel right.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.066
We're gonna figure out
 what's going on here.
 I promise.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.570
I'm not gonna
 lose you again.

15:13.646 --> 15:14.347
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

15:18.251 --> 15:20.587
I heard about Dr. Volker.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.822
Yeah, tough break.

15:22.855 --> 15:26.026
You know,
 this surgery is
 fraught with danger,

15:27.627 --> 15:28.561
even in the best
 of circumstances...

15:28.595 --> 15:29.662
Are you compatible?

15:32.032 --> 15:33.133
Sorry?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.101
Your blood type.
Are you compatible?

15:35.635 --> 15:37.070
No.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.871
I'm just checking. Go on.

15:40.807 --> 15:43.010
Look, I don't want
 to lose anyone on
 this ship, Colonel,

15:43.043 --> 15:46.013
but the fact is,
 a transplant risks
 not just one life, but two.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.914
I'm not just gonna sit back
and let the man die

15:47.947 --> 15:49.816
without at least trying
 to figure out something.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.618
ELI: T.J., we need you
 in Ginn's quarters, now!

15:51.651 --> 15:52.919
(GINN GASPING)

15:52.952 --> 15:54.921
JOHANSEN: I'm on my way.
 Hurry!

15:54.954 --> 15:58.025
(CHOKING) Eli,
what's happening to me?

15:58.658 --> 15:59.692
Ginn...

15:59.726 --> 16:02.029
No. Help me.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.164
Chloe?

16:13.706 --> 16:15.275
JOHANSEN: Chloe?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.809
No, Ginn.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.712
What happened?

16:19.746 --> 16:22.115
You had another
choking attack.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.350
You switched with Chloe
for a minute there.

16:26.053 --> 16:29.389
Look, when you
 switched with her,
 where did you go?

16:29.422 --> 16:30.890
Was there anyone else
 there with you?

16:30.923 --> 16:32.625
GINN: No.

16:32.659 --> 16:37.364
I don't...
 I remember not being
 able to breathe,

16:37.397 --> 16:40.700
and then I woke up
 here just now.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.835
Colonel?
 Yeah.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.972
I checked with
 Corporal Barnes.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.907
The connection
 wasn't cut at any time.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.176
YOUNG: Really?

16:49.209 --> 16:50.943
Then how was Chloe able to
 switch back with her?

16:52.879 --> 16:54.081
See, I don't
 believe that Chloe

16:54.114 --> 16:56.916
is connected with
 anyone at the other end.

16:56.949 --> 17:00.687
I believe her consciousness
 has been in her own body
 the entire time.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.821
Suppressed by Ginn's?

17:01.854 --> 17:03.656
How is that possible?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.258
I don't know.
 I'll have to further study
 the communication device.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.925
We should pull the stone.
 RUSH: No, no, no.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.162
We have to find out why
 this is happening first.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.329
Not at the risk of
 Chloe's life, Rush...

17:10.363 --> 17:11.564
This is crucial
 for understanding

17:11.598 --> 17:14.000
how these
 communication stones work.
 Figure it out, okay?

17:14.032 --> 17:16.169
Because the next time
 she has an attack,
 I'm going to pull the stone.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.936
No, no, you can't...
 No hesitation.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.080
I don't want to hurt Chloe.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.949
Yeah, I know.
 I know you don't.

17:29.982 --> 17:33.253
I agree with Colonel Young.
 If I start choking again,
 disconnect me.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.122
Hopefully we find
 a solution before then.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.823
GINN: Solution?
To the situation.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.793
Chloe?
 What's going on here?

17:40.827 --> 17:41.894
Is it you?

17:41.928 --> 17:44.464
Yes. Matt, what happened?

17:44.497 --> 17:47.434
Ginn connected
 with you when you used
 the communication stones.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.302
Ginn? Well, I thought...

17:50.903 --> 17:52.205
I thought she was dead.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.306
Are you okay?

17:53.340 --> 17:54.174
Yes, I'm fine.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.445
Corporal Barnes,
 did you just
 disconnect the stones?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.280
BARNES: No, sir.
 Still active.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.315
What do you mean?
 She's still connected to me?

18:02.349 --> 18:04.417
Do you feel any different?

18:04.451 --> 18:07.787
Can you sense someone else,
 you know, inside your brain?

18:07.820 --> 18:08.821
What?

18:09.356 --> 18:10.990
Ginn?
Yes.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.825
Oh, man, this is nuts.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.127
What happened?

18:14.161 --> 18:16.062
You switched with Chloe
for a moment there.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.930
SCOTT: Wait a minute,
 you don't remember it?

18:17.964 --> 18:20.467
No. It's all so strange.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.170
I feel weaker.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.337
Here, sit down.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.112
I'm sorry, can you just
 excuse us a second here?

18:34.046 --> 18:35.047
Okay? Eli?

18:38.285 --> 18:40.853
Hey. What?

18:40.887 --> 18:43.790
(STAMMERING) I don't know.
 I mean, we can't be sure
 of anything until...

18:43.823 --> 18:45.057
Eli...

18:46.393 --> 18:48.060
Her energy
 might be decaying.

18:50.029 --> 18:54.100
The radio signal
 getting weaker,
 harder to keep tuned in.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.937
Matt,
 even without disconnecting
 the communication stone,

18:57.970 --> 19:01.808
we might not have
 much time before
 we lose Ginn completely.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.018
How's that
 translation program
 working for you?

19:12.051 --> 19:14.187
Good. A lot
 of information here.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.988
Some good stuff
 about organ transplants.

19:16.523 --> 19:19.158
Hey, you see this?

19:19.192 --> 19:22.795
According to the database,
 it's a kind of
 a ligature device.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.564
Cuts and cauterizes
at the same time?

19:24.597 --> 19:26.032
I thought it did
 something like that,

19:26.065 --> 19:27.467
but I could
 never get it to work.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.069
Hey, T.J.,
 there's a whole section here
 on stem cell-like procedure

19:30.102 --> 19:32.572
for post-op anti-rejection.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.974
It's only 176 pages.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.509
A little light
 afternoon reading.

19:36.543 --> 19:40.213
Still a lot of other
 potential post-operative
 drawbacks.

19:40.247 --> 19:44.116
Infection,
 high blood pressure,
 erectile dysfunction...

20:05.204 --> 20:06.439
After everything
 that's happened recently,

20:06.473 --> 20:09.175
we can't be sure
 this thing's even working
 properly anymore.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.543
What is it
 you're trying to do?

20:10.577 --> 20:13.179
We're trying to see
 if there's a way we can
 intercept Ginn's signal

20:13.212 --> 20:14.847
and download it into
 the ship's memory banks.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.449
YOUNG: Okay, then what?

20:16.483 --> 20:17.884
What is she?
 She's just another program

20:17.917 --> 20:19.452
in the ship's computer?

20:19.486 --> 20:22.555
Well, she'd be preserved,
 for the time being,

20:22.589 --> 20:24.190
until we can
determine the viability

20:24.223 --> 20:26.225
of downloading
 her consciousness

20:26.259 --> 20:27.294
into another body.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.429
JOHANSEN: Colonel?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.432
T.J.?

20:32.465 --> 20:35.335
JOHANSEN: We have a match.
 Two, actually.

20:37.003 --> 20:40.139
Tissue-typing takes a look
 at six specific antigens

20:40.172 --> 20:42.309
in the blood of
 the recipient and the donor.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.312
The best compatibility,
obviously,
is a six-antigen match.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.980
It happens most
 often in families.

20:48.014 --> 20:52.319
The two of you, you both
 have a four-antigen match
 with Dr. Volker,

20:52.352 --> 20:55.054
which is surprisingly good,
considering.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.123
The equipment that you used,
 how accurate is it?

20:57.156 --> 20:58.458
Because I want
to make sure...
I'll do it.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.161
Sergeant, listen to me.

21:02.194 --> 21:04.497
There are a lot
 of risks involved
 in this procedure,

21:04.531 --> 21:06.966
and you
 don't have to decide
 right this instant.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.468
Think it over.
 GREER: No need, sir.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.138
I'm good to go, Lieutenant.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.510
The Ancients wrote
 about a procedure

21:17.544 --> 21:20.547
to eliminate
 post-operative rejection
 of transplanted organs.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.651
It involves removing
 bone marrow stem cells

21:24.684 --> 21:27.153
from the donor
 prior to surgery,

21:27.186 --> 21:31.358
and then implanting them
into the recipient at
the time of the transplant.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.192
It produces a state
called mixed chimerism,

21:33.225 --> 21:35.194
which is basically
 an immune system

21:35.227 --> 21:38.097
that blends elements of both
 the recipient and the donor.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.299
You need some bone marrow.
 So, go ahead and take it.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.003
Okay.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.705
I can give you something
 to put you to sleep
 during the procedure.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.206
Don't worry about it.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.308
We're short on meds.
 You don't need to waste any.

21:49.342 --> 21:52.044
It's really painful, Ron.
 It requires sticking

21:52.078 --> 21:53.680
a large-bore needle
into your hip bone.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.147
The pressure...

21:55.181 --> 21:59.085
The sooner you do it,
 the sooner it gets done.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.255
All right.
I'm going to need you
to lay on your stomach.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.230
VOLKER: Thank you.

22:11.263 --> 22:12.399
No big deal.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.670
Well, yes, it is.
 It's a very big deal.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.005
You'd do
 the same thing for me.

(EXHALES)

22:24.210 --> 22:25.011
Okay.

22:33.285 --> 22:35.087
I'm going to need you
 to hold really still.

 you and Dr. Rush
 were working on something

 communication device?

23:37.349 --> 23:38.150
Yeah, no luck.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.554
Okay, so what's next?

23:41.588 --> 23:43.289
We're kind of running
 out of time here.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.491
Matt?

23:44.524 --> 23:45.592
Chloe?

23:48.360 --> 23:50.396
She's switching
 back and forth
 more frequently now.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.363
SCOTT: How you feeling?

23:52.198 --> 23:53.199
Weird.

23:53.365 --> 23:54.767
Tired.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.335
This whole thing's
 affecting both of them.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.338
Am I still
 connected to Ginn?

23:59.371 --> 24:00.640
Yeah.

24:00.673 --> 24:01.674
SCOTT: But Rush
 is working on it.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.743
We're gonna figure this out.

24:03.776 --> 24:04.811
Is she all right?

24:05.344 --> 24:06.445
ELI: Yeah.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.283
Well, she's fading.

24:11.317 --> 24:13.352
We're trying to figure
 out a way to preserve
 her consciousness

24:13.385 --> 24:15.254
without harming you.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.123
I'm fine.
 Don't worry about me.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.691
Do what you need
 to do to help her.

24:18.725 --> 24:21.561
No, not at
 the risk of hurting you.
 I won't let that happen.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.231
No one
 will let that happen.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.801
Did we switch again?

24:32.739 --> 24:33.740
Ginn.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.577
(EXHALES) I'm sorry,
will you excuse us
a second?

24:46.152 --> 24:48.387
Look, how long
 is this gonna go on?

24:48.420 --> 24:50.289
She hasn't had
 another choking episode.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.224
Yet. Why risk it?

24:53.359 --> 24:54.827
Look, man,
 I know you miss her.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.396
I know how much
 it hurt to lose her.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.799
This isn't about me, Matt.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.233
I'm trying to
 save two people...

25:01.267 --> 25:03.402
What's going on here?

25:03.435 --> 25:04.236
Chloe?

25:05.437 --> 25:08.274
No. Amanda Perry.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.120
Mandy?

25:21.554 --> 25:24.523
Yes, Nick. It's me.

25:24.557 --> 25:28.194
I wondered if
 you were in there,

25:28.227 --> 25:29.596
if there was any chance
 that you survived.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.440
We think Dr. Perry
 has been in there
 the whole time,

25:41.473 --> 25:43.610
but both she and Ginn
 are fading.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.678
Chloe's becoming
 more prominent now.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.614
We're going to have to act
 fast on this, Colonel,

25:47.647 --> 25:49.916
otherwise we're going
 to lose both of them.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.619
Amanda's consciousness
 is already far weaker
 than the other two.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.223
All right. Well, do we
have any solutions yet?

25:57.256 --> 25:58.691
Well, I've had
 no luck with the
 communications device,

25:58.725 --> 26:00.827
but I do have another idea.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.430
The neural interface chair.

26:04.463 --> 26:08.367
Now, I believe with that,
we can isolate
each consciousness

26:08.400 --> 26:10.837
and upload them
into Destiny's
memory bank.

26:11.838 --> 26:12.839
Like Franklin.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.642
Wait, like what?

26:15.675 --> 26:18.678
I've seen and spoken
 to Dr. Franklin many times
 now on the bridge.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.280
So that's what
 happened to him?

26:21.313 --> 26:22.782
He was uploaded
 to the ship?

26:22.815 --> 26:23.983
Well, I can't say
 for certain,

26:24.016 --> 26:25.818
but I do know that
 Destiny has a neural link

26:25.852 --> 26:27.720
with the people
 on board this ship.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.321
It's caused us to
 see things before.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.191
Are you seeing him now?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.494
No.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.230
I managed to sever
 the link shortly after
 your experience

26:38.264 --> 26:40.332
with the alien
 battle simulations.

26:40.366 --> 26:41.968
Always the chair with you.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.903
Well, you asked
 for a solution.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.505
Well, it didn't work
 the first time when Chloe
 was becoming an alien.

26:46.538 --> 26:49.241
Yeah, this is different.
 I know what we're
 dealing with here.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.810
So there's no
 danger to Chloe at all?

26:50.843 --> 26:52.511
I didn't say that!
 Did I say that?

26:53.880 --> 26:55.614
I'm going to have to remove
some of the safeguards

26:55.648 --> 26:57.684
I put into the chair's
 programming, yes,

26:57.717 --> 27:00.352
but I've done
 the calculations.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.621
The chances of
 her being harmed
 are minimal.

27:02.655 --> 27:05.457
Colonel, this is not
 our decision to make.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.352
You know, guys,
 I've got to go
 stretch my legs.

27:33.385 --> 27:34.854
I'll be back in a couple
 of minutes, okay?
 Yeah.

27:44.430 --> 27:47.499
I have never liked
 hospitals or doctors.

27:47.533 --> 27:53.005
Well, this is not a hospital
 and T.J. is no doctor,
 so you're fine.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.574
Thanks, that's comforting.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.576
Mmm-hmm.

27:57.609 --> 28:00.546
All things considered,
though, I wouldn't want
to be anywhere else.

28:03.716 --> 28:04.884
I hear that.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.086
Yeah, I miss home.

28:07.119 --> 28:11.791
Sitting in the backyard,
 warm summer night,
 sippin' a beer,

28:13.592 --> 28:15.461
staring at the stars
 through my telescope,
 you know.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.466
I love that backyard.

28:29.776 --> 28:30.977
All right.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.445
You sure?

28:33.479 --> 28:37.649
Yeah, I don't want to
 disconnect the stone and
 risk losing them forever.

28:39.651 --> 28:41.788
We need to do this.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.389
Whatever it
takes to help them.

28:44.891 --> 28:45.992
Okay.

28:52.799 --> 28:56.936
Hey, T.J., I just
 stopped by the infirmary.
 Volker looks worse.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.673
I know he and Greer
 are ready to do this.

29:05.611 --> 29:06.946
I know you're scared.

29:06.979 --> 29:10.649
This is a major surgery.
 It is complicated,
 and it's dangerous.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.084
And if you do nothing,
 Volker dies.

29:12.118 --> 29:13.820
I do the surgery,
 and they both could die.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.922
That is a risk that
 both men have accepted.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.657
Listen to me.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.759
I'm not gonna
 order you to do this

29:20.793 --> 29:23.462
because you know that
 it needs to be done,

29:23.495 --> 29:25.998
and you know that
you are the only person
who can do it.

29:37.109 --> 29:41.948
It's not permanent, Mandy,

29:41.981 --> 29:48.454
but my hope is to
 find a way of putting
 you into another body.

29:51.557 --> 29:52.892
A fresh start.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.465
That's been my dream
 ever since the accident.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.514
Where'd they go?

30:15.547 --> 30:16.548
Who?

30:18.084 --> 30:19.085
Oh!

30:28.928 --> 30:29.929
Wow.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.502
This place has
 really filled out.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.773
As close to a backyard
 as we're gonna find
 on this ship.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.887
You and me?
 We're gonna be fine.

30:55.621 --> 30:58.024
You can trust that.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.025
JOHANSEN: Greer,
 where the hell are you?

31:01.627 --> 31:02.929
Took a little walk, T.J.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.764
Gettin' some fresh air.

31:05.797 --> 31:06.798
Is Volker with you?

31:12.571 --> 31:13.906
Yes, I am.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.066
I thought a little music
 might help you relax.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.202
The theme to 2001?

31:43.235 --> 31:44.270
Ah!

31:47.839 --> 31:49.275
It's not very relaxing,
is it?

31:50.242 --> 31:51.277
No.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.253
How will I exist?

32:34.286 --> 32:37.289
You'll live
 inside Destiny's
 computer system.

32:38.357 --> 32:41.227
You'll be a part
of the ship. Literally.

32:43.729 --> 32:46.832
And when I'm switched off,
 what will happen to me then?

32:46.865 --> 32:48.800
Now, that can't happen.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.836
The only thing that we can
 switch on and off

32:50.869 --> 32:52.304
is the ability to
 communicate with you.

32:56.242 --> 32:58.877
Remember, this is
 only temporary.

33:00.746 --> 33:03.282

 of alien races

with the ability to
 download a consciousness
 into a host body.

33:07.053 --> 33:09.688
Hell, the Ancient database
 may even have information
 on it.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.290
We just need to find it
and figure out

33:11.323 --> 33:13.325
a way to do it here,
 on the ship.

33:15.427 --> 33:19.865
I know it isn't perfect,
 but we can be together.

33:25.037 --> 33:30.109
Just to see you,
 talk to you,
 hear your voice.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.013
It can be enough.

 that's the lumbar vein

33:52.364 --> 33:53.865
coming off the back
 of the renal vein.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.201
You want to cut that.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.143
JOHANSEN: Okay, got it.

34:08.746 --> 34:11.117
YOUNG: T.J.,
 have you started
 the surgery yet?

34:11.150 --> 34:13.185
Yes, sir,
 about 30 minutes ago.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.786
Ginn had another
 choking attack.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.455
JOHANSEN: Is she all right?

34:16.487 --> 34:19.725
Yeah, she's okay.
 It passed, but I'm not
 waiting any longer.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.960
We've got to do
 the transfer now.

34:21.993 --> 34:23.061
JOHANSEN: I'm going
 to be here another

34:23.094 --> 34:24.896
four or five hours, sir.
 I can't leave.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.266
All right,
 well, keep going.
 We'll manage.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.668
Copy.

34:40.446 --> 34:41.847
Go ahead.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.757
Okay. Ready?

34:54.326 --> 34:55.927
Get the retractors, please?

34:59.198 --> 35:00.199
I want you to pull up.

35:26.892 --> 35:29.195
All right, I'm reading
 two energy signatures,

35:29.228 --> 35:30.529
each separate
 from Chloe's.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.998
Now, are we sure
 that that one's Chloe's?

35:33.031 --> 35:34.466
Well, it appears to be
 the dominant presence,

35:34.500 --> 35:36.067
so I think
 we can safely assume
 that it's Chloe.

35:37.068 --> 35:38.737
I'm transferring
 the other two.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.340
(CHOKING)

35:41.373 --> 35:43.041
She's choking again!
 Turn it off.

I can't, the transfer's
 already begun.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.365
Destiny's mainframe
 just had a huge power surge.

We lost imaging,

(GASPS)

36:16.608 --> 36:18.076
What's happening?

36:18.109 --> 36:19.845
Must have been some
 kind of power surge.

36:19.878 --> 36:20.912
Is it still transferring?

36:20.946 --> 36:22.781
I don't know.
 The mainframe
 is inaccessible.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.917
Anything?
 No, it's crashed.

 I don't know!

36:32.458 --> 36:33.592
What, did you fix it?

36:33.625 --> 36:34.793
RUSH: No.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.829
The ship must have
 overcome the problem.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.030
At least partially,
 at any rate.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.167
There's still
 several systems
 malfunctioning.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.201
Well, can you turn
 the chair off now?

36:43.235 --> 36:44.503
Yeah, but I can't be sure
 the transfer's been...

36:44.536 --> 36:46.204
I don't care.
 Turn the chair off now.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.615
We don't have time!
 I need to finish this!

36:56.648 --> 36:59.851
Hang on. I think
 I've got the ligature
 device back online.

I'm Amanda Perry.

37:07.393 --> 37:08.960
Dr. Perry, how did you...
 No time to explain.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.362
You need to
 finish the surgery.

37:10.396 --> 37:12.464
T.J., what's wrong?
 You're not real.

37:12.498 --> 37:13.765
PERRY: Listen to me.

37:13.799 --> 37:16.502
I'll help you.
 I have access to the entire
 medical database.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.338
Trust me, Tamara.
 I can help.

37:23.642 --> 37:24.476
Okay, tell me what to do.

37:24.510 --> 37:25.511
Who are you talking to?

37:27.078 --> 37:28.414
No one.
 I'll tell you later.

JOHANSEN: I'm fine!

37:30.081 --> 37:31.149
Just let me do this. Go.

37:31.182 --> 37:33.885
All right,
 the first connection
 you need to make

37:33.919 --> 37:37.122
is to the renal vein.
 Attach it to
 the external iliac vein.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.226
Did it transfer?

37:41.259 --> 37:44.229
Yeah, I believe so.

37:44.262 --> 37:48.334
Two new programs have
 suddenly appeared in
 Destiny's memory bank.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.869
One of them, in fact,
 is active somewhere
 on the ship right now.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.038
Doing what?

37:58.043 --> 37:59.978
Okay, the artery's attached.

38:00.011 --> 38:01.046
Go ahead and unclamp it.

38:04.550 --> 38:05.551
It's pink.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.486
That's good.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.397
That's it. You did it.

38:43.355 --> 38:44.189
Yeah.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.263
I'm all right.

infusions.

39:03.409 --> 39:05.010
Over time
 we'll wean him off of it

39:05.043 --> 39:06.578
as he reaches
 a chimeric state,

39:06.612 --> 39:09.014
but hopefully his body
 won't reject the kidney.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.549
We just have
 to wait and see.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.584
He won't reject it.

39:12.618 --> 39:13.952
Great, no pressure.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.722
Hey, you did good.

39:18.457 --> 39:19.958
BARNES: Colonel Young?

39:21.092 --> 39:22.160
Yeah, go ahead.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.629
I need you in
 the Communications Lab.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.703
David?
 Yeah, it's me.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.004
We just made the connection.

39:33.038 --> 39:36.374
We had a problem with
 the communication device
 on our end.

39:36.408 --> 39:37.643
Took a few days,
 but our guys finally
 fixed it.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.245
David...

39:40.278 --> 39:42.247
The bomb was defused.
 Washington is safe.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.060
PERRY: Nicholas...

40:00.432 --> 40:01.433
It worked.

40:03.769 --> 40:04.770
Thank you.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.174
How do you feel?

40:13.812 --> 40:15.013
Free.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.051
Have you peed yet?

40:20.085 --> 40:21.653
What kind of
 question is that?

40:21.687 --> 40:23.822
Well, the kidneys
 clean the blood,
 they process the waste...

40:23.855 --> 40:28.093
No, I know
 what they do, for...
 Yes. I've... Yes, okay?

40:28.126 --> 40:29.427
Good.
Good.

40:29.461 --> 40:33.431
Hey, you need to walk,
 just a little bit around
 the infirmary.

40:33.465 --> 40:34.365
Helps the body heal.

40:40.271 --> 40:44.342
Oh, I gotta go.
 I'm on duty.
 I'll stop by later.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.346
I'll help you.
 (CHUCKLES)

40:49.314 --> 40:50.215
Are you sure?
 Mmm-hmm.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.218
All right.

40:55.721 --> 40:58.056
There might be
 a little infection
 setting in there.

40:59.658 --> 41:00.726
I'm fine.

41:02.661 --> 41:07.065
Yeah. No, I know.
 Just gonna
 change the dressing.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.385
I was getting worried.

41:27.418 --> 41:30.188
I saw your consciousness
 in the memory bank,

41:30.221 --> 41:31.723
but you hadn't
appeared to anyone yet,

41:31.757 --> 41:33.424
so I didn't know
 what to think.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.596
I know it's only temporary.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.331
It is. I promise,

41:42.701 --> 41:45.103
but for now,
 it's the best we can do.

41:46.772 --> 41:48.239
I've thought
 about what you said.

41:50.542 --> 41:56.214
Just being here, seeing you,
 hearing your voice...

41:58.917 --> 42:00.118
It is enough.

43:37.382 --> 43:37.883
