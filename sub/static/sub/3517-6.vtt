01:22.371 --> 01:25.332
<i>We've got an energy crisis, Frank.
And what the White House needs...</i>

01:25.332 --> 01:27.751
The president chose
to remain tough on China.

01:27.918 --> 01:30.420
- <i> No, you forced him to.</i>
- You chose Feng.

01:30.503 --> 01:32.797
<i>You're the one who</i>
<i>put me in a room with him.</i>

01:32.922 --> 01:34.674
<i>The cook can't blame</i>
<i>his ingredients</i>

01:34.841 --> 01:36.342
<i>if he doesn't like</i>
<i>how they taste together.</i>

01:36.467 --> 01:38.636
If samarium prices don't reduce,

01:38.761 --> 01:41.847
the market will have no choice
but to compensate.

01:41.972 --> 01:46.143
That's bad for everyone
who owns an air conditioner.

01:46.268 --> 01:48.019
You should speak to the
president himself.

01:48.144 --> 01:53.566
Well, the president hasn't placed
much value on my advice lately.

01:53.691 --> 01:55.318
I'm in the same boat
as you, Raymond.

01:55.443 --> 01:57.862
<i>Yeah, difference being</i>
<i>you've got an office</i>

01:57.987 --> 02:00.197
three doors down from the Oval.

02:00.322 --> 02:03.534
Let's work together,
for Christ sakes.

02:03.659 --> 02:06.286
I'm willing to put Spotsylvania
behind us if you are.

02:06.411 --> 02:09.580
- <i> I want nothing more.</i>
- Then you'll talk to him?

02:09.705 --> 02:12.250
- Look, I'm late for a meeting, Raymond.
- <i> Yes or no, Frank?</i>

02:12.250 --> 02:15.336
- I can't guarantee he'll listen.
- That's not a yes.

02:15.461 --> 02:17.380
<i>But it's better than a no.</i>

02:17.505 --> 02:19.715
Any pugilist worth his salt
knows when someone's on the ropes,

02:19.840 --> 02:25.095
that's when you throw a combination
to the gut and a left hook to the jaw.

04:01.517 --> 04:04.228
Samarium is the last thing
they'll let go of.

04:04.353 --> 04:08.231
As long as our energy prices
rise, they have the leverage.

04:08.356 --> 04:10.900
Why don't we offer nothing?
Move toward attrition?

04:11.067 --> 04:13.194
If China doesn't show
at the refunding auction,

04:13.319 --> 04:15.655
- long-term interest rates will spike.
- - And in a week,

04:15.780 --> 04:19.158
yields on our ten-year notes
will pierce the seven percent threshold.

04:19.283 --> 04:23.829
That could happen. But if we
go soft now, that will happen.

04:23.954 --> 04:26.123
- You mean go on the offensive.
- We should at least consider it.

04:26.248 --> 04:28.667
The Chinese don't like carrots?
Let's see how they like the stick.

04:28.792 --> 04:30.210
What might that look like?

04:30.335 --> 04:32.378
We could raise inspection
rates on foodstuffs.

04:32.545 --> 04:35.131
- Hold them in ports till they rot.
- How much of a raise?

04:35.256 --> 04:36.924
Twenty percent
if we wanna draw blood.

04:37.049 --> 04:39.718
Bury the move with increased
spot checks all the way around.

04:39.844 --> 04:42.137
These sort of tactics don't
solve the immediate problem.

04:42.179 --> 04:43.931
People are paying triple
the standard rate for electric.

04:44.056 --> 04:46.391
We'll hit a fivefold increase
by August.

04:46.516 --> 04:49.144
What if you, Mr. President,
by executive order,

04:49.269 --> 04:51.646
purchase samarium
through a third party?

04:51.729 --> 04:55.024
Cut the Chinese out, force them to
either raise their prices worldwide

04:55.149 --> 04:57.109
or lower them
to keep direct flow with us.

04:57.234 --> 05:00.779
We stockpile samarium
for defense purposes, of course,

05:00.904 --> 05:03.991
and quietly sell what we don't
need to our friends in nuclear energy.

05:04.116 --> 05:07.244
- At a discount.
- - A subsidy for nuclear power?

05:07.369 --> 05:09.704
The richest of the rich?
How's that gonna play?

05:09.829 --> 05:13.708
Dealing with a national crisis. We can't
get sidetracked with public opinion.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.835
It would show China
we're willing to wait this out.

05:15.877 --> 05:17.712
Do we have the resources?

05:17.795 --> 05:20.547
I'd have to run the numbers,
anticipate fluctuations,

05:20.673 --> 05:23.634
- consider different models...
- Your best guess.

05:23.717 --> 05:26.928
We do, for a moderate stockpile.

05:29.514 --> 05:31.891
All right. Draw up a request
from the Defense Department.

05:32.058 --> 05:35.019
- Yes, sir.
- Linda, draft the executive order.

05:35.144 --> 05:38.314
And, Cathy, make sure we have a third-party
conduit to purchase the samarium.

05:38.397 --> 05:39.440
We'll go through India.

05:39.565 --> 05:41.191
That won't fly well
with Pakistan.

05:41.317 --> 05:43.318
I'll alert them in advance.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.404
As long as they're in the loop,
we'll be all right.

05:45.529 --> 05:50.742
- Not that we owe them any favors.
- All right, let's get to work.

05:50.825 --> 05:53.161
<i>Come on, Betsy.
Three additional counts under Section E?</i>

05:53.286 --> 05:56.956
Three is low. It reflects a narrow
interpretation of criminal intent.

05:57.039 --> 05:59.542
- Your client broke into a data center.
- And what's the offer?

05:59.667 --> 06:01.627
- I'm not doing a plea.
- Will you let me handle this?

06:01.752 --> 06:04.129
They don't want a trial.
The questions I'll be raising,

06:04.296 --> 06:05.922
loud and clear, in open court...

06:06.048 --> 06:07.549
- Lucas, please.
- We have our own questions, Mr. Goodwin.

06:07.674 --> 06:09.509
For example, what were
you doing with these?

06:09.634 --> 06:12.971
- I didn't take these.
- They were in your apartment.

06:13.137 --> 06:14.514
Underwood took them.

06:14.639 --> 06:16.474
Do you really expect a jury
to believe that?

06:16.599 --> 06:18.350
- He did. They were having an affair.
- Are they gonna see them

06:18.476 --> 06:20.894
for what they are? Proof of
your obsession with Ms. Barnes

06:21.020 --> 06:24.231
and the ludicrous conspiracy you have
concocted to explain her death.

06:24.356 --> 06:25.982
Tell us what you're offering.

06:26.108 --> 06:27.817
Client pleads to one
count under Section E

06:27.901 --> 06:29.361
for breaking into a data center.
One count for fraud

06:29.486 --> 06:31.488
<i>for stealing a password</i>
<i>from the</i> Herald.

06:31.654 --> 06:34.157
Ten years under Section E,
ten years for fraud, served concurrently.

06:34.282 --> 06:37.326
Eligible for parole in seven.

06:39.036 --> 06:41.872
I'd like to speak
to my client alone.

06:41.997 --> 06:44.875
Cameras and recording equipment
off, please.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.546
I'll introduce the president.
Then he'll introduce you.

06:49.671 --> 06:51.923
If he's there, we can't
mention the military.

06:52.090 --> 06:55.468
- Just the endemic problem nationwide.
- Of course. I understand.

06:55.593 --> 06:57.803
Good. So we should go
through these speeches

06:57.887 --> 06:59.847
and make sure
that there's nothing...

07:00.014 --> 07:03.684
- Hi, Mrs. Underwood.
- Hello, Christina.

07:03.809 --> 07:06.061
- Mrs. Walker, you asked for me?
- We need to confirm

07:06.186 --> 07:08.021
whether the president's
gonna make it to New Orleans.

07:08.146 --> 07:09.731
- This Friday, correct?
- Yes.

07:09.814 --> 07:12.734
But I know he had a cabinet meeting
this morning, so I imagine...

07:12.817 --> 07:14.610
- I'll talk to Linda right away.
- Thanks.

07:16.445 --> 07:19.031
I know you want Garrett there,
but with this energy crisis...

07:19.156 --> 07:24.036
- No. It's not that.
- What?

07:24.161 --> 07:26.913
- I shouldn't say anything.
- Well, now you have to tell me.

07:29.207 --> 07:33.586
I've just never been
very fond of her. Christina.

07:33.711 --> 07:36.130
- Why not?
- Peter Russo.

07:36.255 --> 07:40.092
I just have a thing about women
who sleep with their bosses.

07:40.217 --> 07:43.804
Anyway, I'm sure whatever
they had was genuine.

07:43.929 --> 07:46.014
It's none of my business, 'cause
if she's doing a good job,

07:46.139 --> 07:49.142
- that's all that matters, right?
- Garrett seems to think she is.

07:49.267 --> 07:52.020
Then I should just keep
my feelings to myself.

07:53.688 --> 07:55.857
So, if the president
is not able to be there,

07:55.982 --> 07:59.401
that could be a silver lining for us. We
won't have to hold back with the military.

07:59.568 --> 08:03.447
Phone taps, video surveillance,

08:03.572 --> 08:07.200
premeditation, sustained intent.
They've got you cold.

08:07.367 --> 08:09.369
If I plead out, that's it.
No one hears the truth.

08:09.494 --> 08:11.663
You don't plead,
no one will hear you, period.

08:11.788 --> 08:13.373
Not until you're
in your seventies.

08:13.498 --> 08:14.874
Have you talked
to Hammerschmidt yet?

08:14.957 --> 08:16.584
You're in no position
to make demands.

08:16.709 --> 08:20.337
- It's not up to you.
- All you'll do is piss them off.

08:21.297 --> 08:23.715
Look...

08:23.841 --> 08:27.844
We've got a good deal here.
A great deal, considering what you did.

08:27.928 --> 08:30.472
You should take it
before they change their mind.

08:30.597 --> 08:35.351
Tom Hammerschmidt. I talk to him
or we're going to trial.

08:35.518 --> 08:36.977
<i>Raise your arms, please.</i>

08:44.025 --> 08:46.319
- You have something here?
- My neck chain.

08:46.486 --> 08:50.281
- May I see it?
- Really? I gotta take off my tie.

08:50.407 --> 08:52.951
I need to see it, sir.

08:58.414 --> 09:02.418
- You're a good Christian, Remy.
- My mother's.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.629
- She was the good Christian.
- Well, then you're just the good son.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.131
- Thank you, sir.
- Hot out there, huh?

09:08.256 --> 09:10.091
Ninety-six according to my car.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.885
We had heat like that
back in Gaffney,

09:11.968 --> 09:13.845
but we didn't know
what air conditioning was,

09:13.928 --> 09:17.306
so we just accepted as fact that
summer was meant to be miserable.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.600
- Neat or with water?
- Just the water.

09:19.725 --> 09:23.020
You can hold the bourbon.
We need to find a solution

09:23.145 --> 09:25.105
so that this one isn't miserable
for 300 million people.

09:25.230 --> 09:27.232
I already have found a solution.

09:27.357 --> 09:29.234
Oh, please, Frank.
A samarium subsidy?

09:29.401 --> 09:32.737
- Is that your skepticism or Raymond's?
- Mine, anticipating his.

09:32.862 --> 09:36.532
So you haven't
spoken to him yet.

09:36.657 --> 09:38.951
I want to offer him
something he can agree to.

09:39.118 --> 09:42.246
- Well, he doesn't have much of a choice.
- Why are you cornering him?

09:42.371 --> 09:44.957
I'm cutting the rate by half.
I'd call that liberating him.

09:45.082 --> 09:46.583
You know that's not
how he'll see it.

09:46.666 --> 09:48.001
This trade war
is preventing the refinery

09:48.126 --> 09:49.878
from being approved in Beijing.

09:49.961 --> 09:52.964
His co-venture with Feng is not
our highest priority right now.

09:53.089 --> 09:55.258
A rare earth refinery solves
this crisis permanently.

09:55.341 --> 09:57.176
Three years from now.
Not this summer.

09:57.301 --> 09:59.678
It's not just that. With the subsidy,
he'll break even, at best.

09:59.803 --> 10:02.014
There's no point in doing business
to hover between red and black.

10:02.139 --> 10:05.726
Raymond's profits are an even lower
priority to me than his co-venture.

10:09.020 --> 10:11.397
Tell me what
you're up to, Frank.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.691
There's nothing to gain
by locking horns with Tusk.

10:13.816 --> 10:16.569
Ask your client. It's Tusk
who's locking the horns.

10:16.694 --> 10:21.448
- He's not a man who likes conflict.
- Neither am I.

10:23.450 --> 10:26.912
Then make the ask. 'Cause I know
you don't care about the subsidy.

10:27.037 --> 10:28.538
This is about something bigger.

10:28.663 --> 10:30.790
I'm a good Christian, Remy,
like your mother.

10:30.957 --> 10:33.626
I would tell you the truth
if I wanted more.

10:33.793 --> 10:35.461
- You trying to send a message?
- Perhaps.

10:35.586 --> 10:38.964
- Which is?
- That stubbornness is far more costly

10:39.048 --> 10:43.260
- than obedience.
- Thanks for the water.

10:45.762 --> 10:50.016
- You're on the wrong side, Remy.
- Yeah, well, one of us sure is.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.101
And when the bumblebee
flew home,

10:52.227 --> 10:55.146
all his friends were waiting
with buckets of honey, right?

10:55.313 --> 11:00.568
And he's got his worm friend, and
his mouse friend, and his spider friend,

11:00.693 --> 11:03.737
and his snail friend,
and they all had tons of honey.

11:03.862 --> 11:05.280
- I like his feet.
- - And he looks happier now, right?

11:05.405 --> 11:07.407
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

11:07.532 --> 11:12.036
- They're funny, right?
- So they all buzzed with happiness,

11:12.120 --> 11:16.165
because life is sweet when
you spend it with your friends.

11:16.290 --> 11:20.294
Right? Can you all buzz your
wings? Buzz your little wings.

11:20.419 --> 11:22.171
Buzz, buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

11:22.212 --> 11:24.715
I think it would make
a fluttering noise, like...

11:26.091 --> 11:28.969
- I don't know.
- Your flutters.

11:39.395 --> 11:41.689
It's too hot out here for you
to be doing this, Francis.

11:41.730 --> 11:43.482
I'm keeping hydrated.

11:45.609 --> 11:49.362
- That even regulation?
- It's only half,

11:49.446 --> 11:55.034
but I don't want the press
to see me practicing on the street.

11:55.118 --> 11:58.913
You remember when you threw out
that first pitch in Greenville?

11:59.038 --> 12:01.123
I was wondering how long it
was gonna take to bring that up.

12:01.248 --> 12:04.251
That wasn't even
on national television.

12:04.376 --> 12:07.462
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

12:10.215 --> 12:14.135
- What happened in Greenville?
- Oh, the Greenville Drive.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.846
Single A team for the Red Sox.

12:16.971 --> 12:19.682
It was a home game,
I get on the mound...

12:19.807 --> 12:22.267
- You threw from the mound?
- Well, I wanted to throw a real pitch.

12:22.393 --> 12:27.355
- Didn't make it.
- Not even close.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.649
Halfway?

12:31.359 --> 12:33.820
Ball slipped out of my hand
just before I released it.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.863
Went straight up in the air
and hit me on top of the head.

12:35.988 --> 12:39.450
The whole stadium
burst a gut laughing.

12:39.575 --> 12:44.121
- Comic relief pitcher.
- Oh, that's very clever, Meechum.

12:47.707 --> 12:51.836
- Don't tell Claire.
- I heard that.

12:51.961 --> 12:55.173
- You're really good with them.
- Nah.

12:55.298 --> 12:57.508
Did you see Robbie,
when they were finger-painting?

12:57.633 --> 13:00.219
He pulled down his pants and
started painting himself blue.

13:00.386 --> 13:02.346
- No!
- Yeah. I hope I got it all off.

13:02.471 --> 13:04.223
I'm sure Alex and Daria
don't care.

13:04.348 --> 13:05.891
They let him run around
naked all the time.

13:06.016 --> 13:08.602
Yeah, but probably not
with his Smurf ass.

13:08.727 --> 13:10.353
Probably not.

13:10.478 --> 13:12.605
What do we want to do
for dinner tonight?

13:12.730 --> 13:14.982
I've got some leftover chicken
or we could order pizza.

13:15.066 --> 13:17.318
- Pizza. No dishes.
- Yeah.

13:22.364 --> 13:27.494
I'm really sorry, I totally forgot I've
got a friend picking me up tonight.

13:27.661 --> 13:29.162
- I completely blanked.
- That's fine.

13:29.204 --> 13:32.165
- I'm really sorry.
- Don't sweat it.

13:32.290 --> 13:37.670
- Is it your boyfriend?
- No, no... just an old friend.

13:37.795 --> 13:43.008
- Can I meet him?
- Um... He's... kinda shy. I don't...

13:43.133 --> 13:45.719
- ...know if he'd be up for...
- Totally cool. Don't worry about it.

13:45.844 --> 13:50.598
- We'll just do dinner another night.
- All right.

13:50.723 --> 13:53.559
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah. You know where I'll be.

13:53.685 --> 13:55.895
- Yeah.
- OK.

14:01.317 --> 14:04.903
- How long?
- Couple of months.

14:05.028 --> 14:08.156
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I can't go to church?

14:08.240 --> 14:11.117
Anywhere you interact with other
people opens us up to risk.

14:11.201 --> 14:13.119
I'm just supposed to slave away
at the fucking call center

14:13.202 --> 14:15.788
- and then lock myself in the apartment.
- Don't get dramatic.

14:15.788 --> 14:20.000
I like the Fellowship, OK?
There's nothing to worry about there.

14:20.125 --> 14:23.921
All it takes is one person's
cousin to visit from Lynchburg.

14:24.046 --> 14:26.965
Someone you went to school with, or
some client that you spent the night with.

14:27.090 --> 14:29.217
- Those guys would never end up here.
- You don't know that.

14:29.301 --> 14:33.221
- Yeah, I do.
- You ended up here, didn't you?

14:36.224 --> 14:38.476
What?

14:38.601 --> 14:41.603
- I can't live like this.
- Yes, you can.

14:41.729 --> 14:44.606
You're a strong girl.

14:51.029 --> 14:54.282
That's it?
That's everything?

14:54.407 --> 14:55.867
I know, you've heard it before.

14:55.992 --> 14:59.453
As a friend, Lucas,
not as a reporter.

15:03.790 --> 15:06.418
Now I dig.

15:06.543 --> 15:09.921
I make the phone calls.
I do the legwork.

15:11.339 --> 15:13.007
They treating you OK?

15:13.174 --> 15:15.134
- It's fine.
- That's not what I asked.

15:15.259 --> 15:19.388
They're pushing
the plea deal pretty hard.

15:19.513 --> 15:21.056
How seriously are you
considering it?

15:21.098 --> 15:23.517
I want to see how this
article impacts things.

15:23.642 --> 15:27.229
- What does your lawyer say?
- He thinks that's a bad idea,

15:27.312 --> 15:29.356
that I should take the plea.

15:29.481 --> 15:32.942
- Maybe you should listen to him.
- No. I want the article.

15:33.067 --> 15:36.279
<i>- </i> That I'm certain of.
- All right.

15:36.362 --> 15:41.658
- I better get to it then.
- Thank you.

15:41.784 --> 15:45.537
You need to know, I'm gonna treat
this the way I would any other story.

15:45.662 --> 15:49.290
Whatever the facts bear.
You might not like what I write.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.460
- I get that.
- I'll let you read it first.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.629
- Then you can decide.
- That's all I'm asking.

15:54.754 --> 15:57.882
Hang in there.

16:09.768 --> 16:14.439
Can you wipe this shit off?
Please!

16:14.564 --> 16:16.399
And the other nuclear
providers are on board?

16:16.482 --> 16:19.235
Most. Except Raymond's
company and a couple of others.

16:19.318 --> 16:20.945
Lakeport Nuclear, Wolf Springs.

16:21.070 --> 16:22.696
Now, I can't prove it,

16:22.821 --> 16:25.741
but I am absolutely sure
they're colluding.

16:25.866 --> 16:28.451
Raymond wants to embarrass me.

16:28.577 --> 16:32.163
I offer a solution,
nuclear lobby turns its back.

16:32.330 --> 16:34.332
He has a right to refuse,
Mr. President.

16:34.457 --> 16:37.585
What he cannot do is manipulate
the energy market.

16:37.710 --> 16:41.005
You want to put pressure
on the distribution side.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.549
More than pressure. Ban vertical
integration entirely.

16:43.674 --> 16:45.550
We don't have that
regulatory power.

16:45.676 --> 16:48.511
We add an antitrust agreement
to the emergency energy bill.

16:48.637 --> 16:50.346
We break up the regional supply

16:50.472 --> 16:53.850
and distribution monopolies
like the Bell System.

16:53.975 --> 16:55.852
It'll be challenged immediately
in the courts.

16:55.977 --> 16:59.813
We don't need it to pass,
we just need to threaten it.

16:59.939 --> 17:01.732
See if he falls into line.

17:05.027 --> 17:08.405
Is there a way to do that without
it making its way into the news?

17:08.530 --> 17:12.367
I don't want the world's wealthiest
one percent on my phone sheet.

17:12.450 --> 17:17.329
There is absolutely a way
to do that, sir.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.545
Here you go.

17:25.671 --> 17:29.341
- Crowded for a Tuesday night.
- We keep it at 65 degrees.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.467
- And it's free.
- If you call 18 bucks

17:31.593 --> 17:35.346
- for a vodka soda free.
- Still cheaper than a Pepco bill.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.765
- Depends on how many you have.
- You trying to get us drunk?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.768
Drunker you are, bigger you tip.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.313
I don't have to be drunk
to appreciate good service.

17:44.396 --> 17:47.941
- I'll get your change.
- No, you won't.

17:48.066 --> 17:52.403
- Thank you.
- You're shameless.

17:52.528 --> 17:54.989
Makes me a good lobbyist.

17:55.114 --> 17:56.657
Cheers.

18:00.202 --> 18:04.081
So, Jackie... bold move,
but it won't work.

18:04.206 --> 18:06.792
You know we can pass this
amendment in a heartbeat.

18:06.917 --> 18:09.085
Maybe, but no one will comply.
It'll get overturned.

18:09.210 --> 18:11.504
- Big fuss for nothing.
- It might get overturned,

18:11.629 --> 18:14.757
- but it gets ink along the way.
- One thing about Raymond Tusk

18:14.882 --> 18:16.926
is he doesn't give two
bird shits about public opinion.

18:17.051 --> 18:19.845
- His stockholders do.
- They'd jump in a pit of snakes

18:19.970 --> 18:21.972
and light themselves on fire
if he gave the word.

18:22.014 --> 18:24.808
All I'm asking is
that you convey our intentions.

18:24.933 --> 18:27.811
Why me? Frank could
easily pick up the phone.

18:27.936 --> 18:29.771
You still call him Frank?

18:29.896 --> 18:33.441
Not to his face, which I try
to keep to a minimum.

18:33.566 --> 18:35.484
Don't you appreciate having
an ear in the White House?

18:35.610 --> 18:38.195
I would, if I had an ear.
But lately all I've got is a mouth.

18:38.320 --> 18:42.741
Yeah. He's not
the best listener, is he?

18:42.866 --> 18:46.453
- Try working for him.
- You were on his staff?

18:46.536 --> 18:49.914
Eight years. Press secretary.
Before you joined Congress.

18:51.332 --> 18:52.375
That explains a lot.

18:52.458 --> 18:57.046
- Like what?
- Like a lot.

18:57.171 --> 18:59.590
- I'll take that as an insult.
- You should.

19:03.051 --> 19:04.219
That's it? You abandoning me?

19:04.261 --> 19:05.512
No, I'm buying the next round.

19:05.637 --> 19:07.847
I can't accept
gifts from lobbyists

19:07.973 --> 19:09.516
without reciprocating.

19:09.641 --> 19:11.768
Plus, I'm a good wingman.

19:11.893 --> 19:14.979
This gets you more face time
with the barmaid.

19:31.703 --> 19:33.496
You already got 'em ready?

19:33.621 --> 19:36.999
Your guys gave me the
heads-up you were comin'.

19:37.124 --> 19:39.543
Well, I hope that they didn't
wake you earlier than usual.

19:39.710 --> 19:44.298
Fuck, man, with this heat,
I ain't sleepin' much anyway.

19:44.423 --> 19:47.134
- What? No AC at home?
- I got a unit.

19:47.259 --> 19:49.636
I just don't wanna pay
the damn bill.

19:49.761 --> 19:52.805
It's not too bad in here,
all things considered.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.057
That's 'cause we in the shade.

19:55.183 --> 19:58.185
You get outside a couple hours
from now on that pavement,

19:58.352 --> 20:00.688
fry your damn dick off
from three feet below.

20:00.813 --> 20:02.481
Must be bad over that grill.

20:02.564 --> 20:05.734
I can't tell the
difference no more.

20:05.859 --> 20:08.278
I tell you what, though,

20:08.403 --> 20:12.031
stuff goes down 'round here
when the mercury pop a hundred.

20:12.156 --> 20:17.036
Man who beat his wife at home
will beat her right out on the street.

20:17.161 --> 20:19.705
- Brings out the animal in us?
- That ain't no joke.

20:19.914 --> 20:23.709
What used to wake me up?
Gunshots.

20:23.876 --> 20:27.963
Now you know what does it?
People fuckin'.

20:28.088 --> 20:32.133
Moanin' and screamin'
like goddamn cats in the alley.

20:32.258 --> 20:34.302
You know what they say,

20:34.469 --> 20:38.514
when you get hot and sweaty,
it make you ripe and ready.

20:42.476 --> 20:46.271
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:47.439 --> 20:52.986
- I drank too much.
- We both did.

20:55.279 --> 20:58.365
- Last night didn't happen.
- I know.

20:58.491 --> 21:02.161
When I walk out that door,
it's business as usual.

21:02.286 --> 21:03.579
- No special treatment.
- Don't worry.

21:03.745 --> 21:06.456
You won't need
a restraining order.

21:10.668 --> 21:13.129
I'm surprised you didn't
go for the waitress.

21:13.254 --> 21:15.798
- You're much sexier.
- Yeah, OK.

21:15.923 --> 21:17.967
She works for tips.
You run Congress.

21:18.092 --> 21:21.595
- Only half of it.
- That's half more than she does.

21:21.720 --> 21:24.223
So it's not my body.

21:24.348 --> 21:28.560
- Those legs don't hurt.
- You're so full of shit.

21:30.603 --> 21:35.608
OK. It's your voice.

21:35.733 --> 21:40.446
- My voice?
- Mm-hm. It does something to me.

21:43.365 --> 21:45.242
Let me know what Tusk
has to say.

21:48.495 --> 21:51.289
Business hasn't started yet.
You haven't walked out that door yet.

21:52.081 --> 21:53.624
Watch me.

22:22.025 --> 22:24.611
Thank you, Jackie.

22:28.073 --> 22:29.491
We're going to the White House.

22:29.616 --> 22:32.327
Little John on the move.

22:34.203 --> 22:36.622
We raise the bet.
We get FERC involved.

22:36.706 --> 22:38.624
- An investigation?
- We don't need Congress

22:38.707 --> 22:40.709
- to activate the regulatory commission.
- But a price-fixing review?

22:40.834 --> 22:43.420
- That would take months.
- Again, it's the threat,

22:43.545 --> 22:45.297
- not the actuality.
- He'll employ the same logic.

22:45.422 --> 22:47.048
Draw it out,
fight back with appeals.

22:47.215 --> 22:50.009
But he'll have to divulge his
accounting if FERC takes action.

22:50.176 --> 22:52.595
Now, no businessman
wants to open up his books,

22:52.679 --> 22:55.181
especially one with $43 billion.

22:55.306 --> 22:59.310
This is getting out of hand, Frank.
We shouldn't be duking it out with Raymond.

22:59.435 --> 23:01.770
- Maybe we should talk to him.
- That's exactly what he wants.

23:01.937 --> 23:04.564
To force himself
back into the mix.

23:04.690 --> 23:06.316
What's to be gained
by shutting him out?

23:06.441 --> 23:08.860
The simple lesson
that you cannot strong-arm

23:08.985 --> 23:11.946
the president
of the United States.

23:13.448 --> 23:15.658
We can't devolve
to a pissing contest.

23:15.741 --> 23:18.035
I'm gonna call Raymond.
Invite him to Washington.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.037
He won't accept anything
but total surrender.

23:20.162 --> 23:23.665
- I'm making the call.
- Don't put yourself in that position.

23:23.749 --> 23:26.793
I know how to maintain
the integrity of my office.

23:26.918 --> 23:31.381
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

23:31.506 --> 23:34.759
Two minutes with the president and
Tusk may be back in his good graces.

23:34.884 --> 23:38.220
I need to disrupt the nuptials
and prevent a second marriage.

23:56.153 --> 23:57.780
- Christina?
- Good to see you.

23:57.905 --> 24:00.241
Oh, please.

24:00.366 --> 24:03.285
- You look great.
- Thank you.

24:03.452 --> 24:06.663
- How are things?
- Great.

24:06.746 --> 24:09.999
Linda works me to the bone,
but that's what I signed up for.

24:10.125 --> 24:12.543
Well, from what I've heard,
you're doing a great job.

24:12.669 --> 24:14.295
Well, that's really nice
to hear.

24:14.420 --> 24:17.340
Look, I wanted to talk to you
about Tricia.

24:17.465 --> 24:22.094
I'm sure you've noticed that she's still
sort of adjusting to her role.

24:22.219 --> 24:25.597
You mean her... confidence.

24:25.722 --> 24:28.099
I think it would be great
if you reached out to her.

24:28.224 --> 24:32.186
Just let her know that you're there
if there's anything she needs.

24:32.312 --> 24:35.064
I don't really know her that well.
I mean, we've met, but I...

24:35.189 --> 24:37.692
That's OK.
Maybe just tell her

24:37.775 --> 24:39.443
that you enjoy
working for the president,

24:39.568 --> 24:44.531
and you're there to be of help
to her in any way you can.

24:44.656 --> 24:46.450
You don't think that's a little,
I don't know, brash?

24:46.575 --> 24:49.828
- How?
- For me to just approach her like that?

24:49.953 --> 24:51.996
No. Not at all.

25:39.999 --> 25:43.710
<i>You've reached the Skorsky residence.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

25:43.835 --> 25:47.255
Tom Hammerschmidt again. I'm
still trying to reach Janine.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.758
Still important. Thank you.

25:55.513 --> 25:58.099
<i>Hammerschmidt's been
calling our press office all day.</i>

25:58.224 --> 26:00.601
I don't want a story to come out
any more than you do.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.436
We lose a major asset
if it does.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.229
Can you squash it
for security reasons?

26:04.354 --> 26:07.065
Not once it's been shared with
the press. First Amendment crap.

26:07.190 --> 26:12.528
Ward isn't making things any easier.
She wants a notch in her belt.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.739
We're giving her one.

26:14.864 --> 26:17.867
Not Goodwin. She wants Orsay.

26:17.950 --> 26:20.244
Most-wanted list for six years.

26:22.204 --> 26:23.997
I'll handle Hammerschmidt.

26:24.122 --> 26:26.708
You need to make sure Goodwin
takes the plea.

26:26.833 --> 26:29.336
If 35 with no parole doesn't
scare the piss out of him,

26:29.461 --> 26:32.380
- I don't know what will.
- Then don't try to scare him.

26:33.673 --> 26:36.467
Remove hope from the equation.

26:38.844 --> 26:42.097
I tried to keep this contained.

26:42.222 --> 26:46.768
I didn't anticipate
Hammerschmidt.

26:46.893 --> 26:50.814
- Is Ms. Skorsky cooperating with him?
- He's called her.

26:50.897 --> 26:54.358
My guy at the bureau says
they haven't actually spoken.

26:54.484 --> 26:57.278
At least not on the phone.

26:57.403 --> 26:59.863
- If this goes to court...
- That won't happen, sir.

26:59.947 --> 27:01.740
It will if he publishes.

27:01.865 --> 27:05.577
I'm bringing this to you
because I can't control Hammerschmidt.

27:05.702 --> 27:07.913
I don't know what to do.

27:11.916 --> 27:16.629
We need to invite a full-frontal
attack. Then hold the line.

27:16.796 --> 27:21.216
- You want to speak to him?
- Face-to-face. Just the two of us.

27:21.342 --> 27:25.012
- I don't think that's a good idea, sir.
- You have a better idea?

27:26.972 --> 27:29.015
- No, sir.
- We can't avoid the battle,

27:29.140 --> 27:31.142
but we can choose
the battlefield.

27:31.267 --> 27:34.604
Set up a meeting at the White
House. We'll intimidate him with formality.

27:34.729 --> 27:36.647
Yes, sir.

27:39.024 --> 27:40.985
Mr. Vice President?

27:41.110 --> 27:43.904
I know you don't have patience
for apologies,

27:43.987 --> 27:45.739
but I'm sorry if I've
let you down in any way.

27:45.864 --> 27:48.158
Let's concentrate
on what's in front of us.

27:48.283 --> 27:49.701
I'll let you know
when I have a time set up.

27:49.826 --> 27:52.662
- As soon as possible.
- Yes, sir.

28:09.260 --> 28:12.639
So this is a sort of outline
to the larger piece?

28:12.764 --> 28:15.433
With questions on the next page.

28:27.819 --> 28:30.613
- We're off the record?
- Yes, off the record.

28:30.738 --> 28:33.783
Now, Tom, I know that you care
about this young man,

28:33.950 --> 28:35.993
and I respect you as a
journalist, but these questions?

28:36.077 --> 28:40.331
Why don't you just ask me
when I stopped strangling people's pets.

28:40.456 --> 28:41.999
Sir, the death
of Congressman Russo...

28:42.040 --> 28:44.835
You mean my friend, Peter Russo,

28:44.960 --> 28:48.213
whose suicide left two
small children with no father.

28:48.338 --> 28:51.466
No, I will not answer
questions about that.

28:52.342 --> 28:54.010
Yes?

28:54.135 --> 28:57.680
I'm aware of that. No, tell her
I'll call her right back.

28:57.805 --> 29:00.307
Two minutes. Secretary Durant.

29:00.432 --> 29:02.810
- I can wait outside...
- No, let's finish.

29:02.935 --> 29:07.564
Now, if you decide
to print any of this,

29:07.689 --> 29:10.150
assuming you find an outlet
that's willing to, then yes,

29:10.275 --> 29:13.027
it might cause me
a headache for a day.

29:13.111 --> 29:14.403
But I will not engage.

29:14.529 --> 29:16.489
And I think it will only
prove to highlight

29:16.614 --> 29:18.407
how ridiculous Mr. Goodwin's
claims are.

29:18.532 --> 29:21.660
I pity him. I truly do.
I think he needs help.

29:21.827 --> 29:24.246
I've interviewed many mentally
ill people. He's not one of them.

29:24.371 --> 29:27.666
Well, I would suggest that you
read your own article again.

29:27.791 --> 29:29.959
He's distressed.
There's a difference.

29:30.043 --> 29:33.296
Look, I understand. It must be
a terrible blow to see him in prison,

29:33.421 --> 29:35.590
- but Tom...
- Rachel Posner exists.

29:35.715 --> 29:39.718
I haven't been able to find her,
but I've proven she's not a fantasy.

29:39.843 --> 29:42.096
The same goes for Roy Kapeniak.
These people were born.

29:42.221 --> 29:44.431
They have Social Security
numbers, past addresses.

29:44.556 --> 29:48.059
So does everyone from California to Maine.
Have I conspired with all of them?

29:48.226 --> 29:51.813
You have to admit there are some
troubling details regarding the DUI.

29:51.938 --> 29:54.857
You know, people say the same
thing about Area 51.

29:55.024 --> 29:57.360
You can conjure up little gray
men if you really want to.

29:57.443 --> 30:03.157
- Did you kill Peter Russo?
- Tom, you're embarrassing yourself.

30:03.282 --> 30:05.117
Did you kill Zoe Barnes?

30:05.242 --> 30:07.577
I've given you more time
than this nonsense deserves.

30:07.744 --> 30:10.080
- I have to ask these questions.
- The only question I would ask is:

30:10.163 --> 30:12.582
does this sort of article
hurt or help Mr. Goodwin?

30:12.707 --> 30:16.419
You have to do what you think
is right. But I hope you can understand

30:16.585 --> 30:19.463
if I don't demean myself
by taking any of it seriously.

30:19.588 --> 30:22.132
I appreciate your time,
Mr. Vice President.

30:38.147 --> 30:41.942
- How'd it go?
- I did my part. Now put it to bed, Doug.

30:42.067 --> 30:44.069
I won't submit myself
to this sort of exposure again.

30:44.152 --> 30:46.488
- Yes, sir.
- Has Tusk met with the president yet?

30:46.613 --> 30:48.948
- Linda said they're meeting at 4:30.
- Call Remy.

30:49.074 --> 30:51.492
Make sure he doesn't get on
his plane before I see him.

30:51.659 --> 30:53.077
I'm on it.

31:07.674 --> 31:10.218
Oh, Mrs. Walker?

31:10.343 --> 31:13.679
I just wanted to say how rewarding it's
been working here in the West Wing.

31:13.805 --> 31:16.265
And I'm so proud to be working
for your husband.

31:16.390 --> 31:20.769
Thank you. I know he
appreciates all your hard work.

31:20.936 --> 31:23.355
Well, now that I'm working
so closely with him,

31:23.480 --> 31:25.399
if there's anything
I can do for you,

31:25.524 --> 31:29.819
anything that would make yours
or his life easier...

31:29.944 --> 31:33.906
- Just keep doing what you're doing.
- Truly, anything.

31:34.031 --> 31:38.661
I want you to know you can
rely on me. Both of you.

31:38.786 --> 31:42.247
I know that.
Thank you, Christina.

31:42.414 --> 31:44.333
Thanks, Mrs. Walker.

31:51.798 --> 31:54.550
- Oh, here. Let me.
- Oh, it's just my hands...

31:54.675 --> 31:58.053
- Are they bothering you?
- Yeah, probably gonna get rain tonight.

31:58.179 --> 32:00.431
I'll get it.

32:00.556 --> 32:04.142
Um, no, just keep
the broth moving.

32:08.480 --> 32:11.774
Agent Green, FBI. Do you have
a moment, Ms. Skorsky?

32:11.900 --> 32:13.860
- Yeah, I...
- May we come in?

32:13.985 --> 32:17.196
I just need to
turn the stove off.

32:19.198 --> 32:20.991
- Stay in here, Mom.
- Who is it?

32:21.116 --> 32:23.535
Just stay in here.

32:26.663 --> 32:28.123
Only that once?

32:28.206 --> 32:30.416
And I haven't seen him since,
or returned his calls.

32:30.542 --> 32:34.087
- How many times has he tried to call you?
- I don't know.

32:34.212 --> 32:38.632
Eight or nine times, maybe.
And then he stopped after a while.

32:38.757 --> 32:42.261
Did he mention anything about
Heronymous Bot or Gavin Orsay?

32:42.386 --> 32:44.763
You know, I think
I should talk to a lawyer.

32:44.930 --> 32:47.432
Right now you're not suspected
of being an accomplice.

32:47.557 --> 32:50.477
If you call a lawyer,
we might have to reconsider.

32:53.396 --> 32:57.233
- He mentioned some hacker.
- Heronymous.

32:57.358 --> 32:59.276
I told him I thought it
was a bad idea to contact him.

32:59.401 --> 33:02.988
- Are you aware of what he's claiming?
- No.

33:03.113 --> 33:04.906
That you and he
were working together.

33:05.032 --> 33:07.659
That you believe
in this conspiracy theory.

33:07.784 --> 33:12.413
That it was you who received
explicit photos of Ms. Barnes.

33:12.538 --> 33:14.707
Is any of that true?

33:20.337 --> 33:22.256
We need you to come back
to DC with us

33:22.339 --> 33:26.093
and sign this statement in the
presence of the US attorney.

33:28.011 --> 33:30.680
- You want me to call him a liar.
- Isn't he?

33:30.847 --> 33:32.265
I can't do that to him.

33:32.390 --> 33:35.101
We also need you to speak
with Tom Hammerschmidt.

33:35.226 --> 33:37.436
You know what, please, can you
just keep me out of this?

33:37.478 --> 33:39.438
I had nothing to do
with the hacker or the...

33:39.605 --> 33:41.231
Ms. Skorsky, we want
to believe you.

33:41.315 --> 33:44.067
And we will,
if you put all of it in writing.

33:44.192 --> 33:48.405
He's not a criminal. You're
going after the wrong person.

33:48.530 --> 33:50.824
And if you think
that you can intimidate me,

33:50.949 --> 33:54.744
harass me like this in my
own home, I will file a formal complaint.

33:54.869 --> 33:57.329
You're starting to sound
an awful lot like him.

33:59.290 --> 34:03.377
You can't arrest me.
I haven't done anything.

34:03.502 --> 34:05.337
I'd like you to leave.

34:05.462 --> 34:08.172
I have a right to legal counsel
and you haven't presented a warrant.

34:08.297 --> 34:13.219
We can arrest you, Ms. Skorsky,
for abetting an act of cyberterrorism.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.054
Who's going to take care
of your mother

34:16.179 --> 34:20.351
while you're spending the next
three years in courtrooms?

34:20.476 --> 34:23.187
Would you please
raise your arms?

34:23.312 --> 34:25.313
- No, Meechum.
- Sir.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.606
Meechum.

34:26.731 --> 34:27.732
I know you don't want
to shake my hand,

34:27.857 --> 34:29.818
so we'll just skip that part.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.737
The president didn't
mention anything about it.

34:33.862 --> 34:37.074
Why would he?
Better to catch you off guard.

34:37.199 --> 34:42.621
- Then why would you?
- So we can avoid unnecessary conflict.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.290
Garrett's not a good liar.

34:45.373 --> 34:49.710
The gift of a good liar is making people
think you lack a talent for lying.

34:49.835 --> 34:55.424
I know him far better than you, and so
I know what talents he has and lacks.

34:55.550 --> 34:58.135
But let's assume he did lie.

34:58.260 --> 35:02.473
I'm not intimidated
by a FERC investigation.

35:02.639 --> 35:05.892
You'd have grid overload and brownouts
before you could even get a hearing.

35:06.017 --> 35:08.353
You are deliberately keeping
electric prices at inflated rates,

35:08.520 --> 35:10.855
- which is illegal.
- No.

35:10.980 --> 35:15.985
- I'm responding to the free market.
- A regulated free market.

35:16.944 --> 35:18.446
Why are you doing this, Frank?

35:18.571 --> 35:22.407
Remy asked me the same thing.

35:22.533 --> 35:25.786
- You're making this about me.
- This isn't personal, Raymond.

35:25.911 --> 35:28.955
The integrity of our energy
markets is my only concern.

35:29.122 --> 35:32.125
Of course it's personal.
I asked you, personally,

35:32.250 --> 35:34.460
to convince Garrett to pull back
from China.

35:34.585 --> 35:37.171
You personally chose not to.

35:37.296 --> 35:39.381
You personally sabotaged
the summit.

35:39.506 --> 35:41.592
- I have never once in my career...
- You personally advised...

35:41.759 --> 35:44.845
- ...allowed personal...
- ...to push me up against the wall.

35:44.970 --> 35:48.640
Do not try and spin me, Frank!
I am too old to tango!

35:48.765 --> 35:52.060
Then I'll be blunt. Accept the
subsidies or deal with FERC.

35:52.185 --> 35:53.770
There is no third way here.

35:53.895 --> 35:57.481
Are you intentionally trying
to destroy the president?

35:57.606 --> 36:02.402
I'm trying to protect
the president... from you.

36:04.655 --> 36:07.073
This is about the secretary
of state nomination, isn't it?

36:07.073 --> 36:10.493
I'm the vice president now. I don't cry
over what happened in kindergarten.

36:10.618 --> 36:13.079
You're vice president
because I vouched for you.

36:13.204 --> 36:17.416
Because you had no other
options. Political necessity.

36:19.585 --> 36:24.214
- You have 24 hours to decide.
- I'll show myself out.

36:28.843 --> 36:30.428
Hello.

36:30.553 --> 36:34.474
Raymond, this is Claire.

36:34.599 --> 36:37.393
Mrs. Underwood, it is an honor.

36:37.476 --> 36:43.023
Jean... my wife, has been very
taken with your recent efforts.

36:43.190 --> 36:44.566
Well, I'd like
to meet her one day.

36:44.650 --> 36:46.443
She would very much
like that, I'm sure.

36:46.568 --> 36:50.029
- And what about you?
- I'm sorry?

36:50.155 --> 36:52.115
What are your thoughts
about our recent efforts?

36:52.240 --> 36:55.201
Oh. I am in favor of anything

36:55.326 --> 36:58.913
that prevents
unnecessary violence.

36:59.038 --> 37:01.165
It's nice to meet you,
Mrs. Underwood.

37:01.290 --> 37:06.044
And good luck with that
first pitch tonight, Mr. Vice President.

37:06.169 --> 37:09.589
Make it to the plate this time.

37:09.714 --> 37:10.924
Ma'am.

37:12.383 --> 37:18.431
<i>♪ Gave proof through the night ♪</i>

37:18.514 --> 37:24.478

<i>star-spangled...♪</i>

37:31.192 --> 37:34.445
- This Kevlar is cooking me.
- We have to use it, sir.

37:34.529 --> 37:37.365
Well, I didn't practice with it.
Now I can hardly rotate my arm.

37:37.490 --> 37:39.325
I should have mentioned it.
I apologize.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.577
If this ball doesn't make it
over the plate, it's your ass.

37:41.702 --> 37:45.580
And what are you doing here?
Don't you have things to do?

37:45.747 --> 37:48.041
Never been to Camden Yards.

37:54.589 --> 38:01.220

Ladies and gentlemen,
here to throw out the first pitch tonight,

38:05.307 --> 38:09.227
we are honored to introduce
the vice president of the United States,

38:09.352 --> 38:14.148
Frank Underwood!

38:21.655 --> 38:24.574
Boss, boss. Use his ball.

38:31.331 --> 38:34.208
Thank you very much. Where's
the mascot? There you are.

38:34.333 --> 38:35.835
Pleasure.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.295
Beautiful job.

38:38.462 --> 38:42.591
Good evening. Now, I know it's a hot night
and you all want to get to the baseball.

38:42.716 --> 38:47.637
So as soon as I throw this sucker,
grab a drink, enjoy the game,

38:47.762 --> 38:49.556
and best of luck to both teams.

38:49.639 --> 38:52.850
Ah, scratch that.
We're at Camden Yards.

38:52.975 --> 38:56.020
Go Orioles!

39:31.386 --> 39:33.763
Let's go, sir.
We've gotta move!

39:38.559 --> 39:41.937
Got him.
We're on the move.

39:43.564 --> 39:46.024
I'm told the distribution line that
controls the pinch point

39:46.024 --> 39:48.443
caused the outages.
BAPCO, one of your companies.

39:48.568 --> 39:50.695
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>There was a capacity issue.</i>

39:50.820 --> 39:52.905
<i>We're working as quickly</i>
<i>as we can to resolve it.</i>

39:53.031 --> 39:54.449
I've got
three governors calling,

39:54.574 --> 39:56.075
hospitals on emergency power,

39:56.200 --> 39:57.201
so quickly better mean quickly.

39:57.326 --> 39:58.994
<i>The latest estimate I got</i>

39:59.119 --> 40:00.746
<i>was two to three hours,</i>
<i>maybe sooner.</i>

40:00.871 --> 40:03.123
Raymond, was this intentional?

40:03.248 --> 40:09.045
Sir, I know you don't hold me
in the highest regard at the moment,

40:09.170 --> 40:11.714
but I am alarmed

40:11.839 --> 40:14.050
that you could even
entertain such a thought.

40:14.217 --> 40:17.720
<i>Well, the timing makes</i>
<i>coincidence hard to swallow.</i>

40:17.845 --> 40:21.974
There is a heat wave. That always
pushes the grid to its limits.

40:22.099 --> 40:25.143
Let's get the people out of the dark.
Updates every 30 minutes on your progress.

40:25.268 --> 40:31.191
I should inform you, sir, that I may need
to take two of my plants offline tomorrow,

40:31.316 --> 40:34.485
- <i> for unscheduled maintenance.</i>
- Why? Which ones?

40:34.610 --> 40:36.237
<i>Georgia and Tennessee.</i>

40:36.362 --> 40:38.656
<i>This blackout has put</i>
<i>a great deal of stress on them.</i>

40:38.739 --> 40:43.702
My engineers are concerned
about the seals on the fuel rods.

40:43.827 --> 40:46.121
So we're looking at outages
on the Southeast grid, too?

40:46.246 --> 40:48.707
- <i> Could be, for a few days.</i>
- That's unacceptable.

40:48.832 --> 40:51.584
Safety comes first.
We don't want an accident.

40:51.668 --> 40:55.254
- Let's get a full report to Linda ASAP.
- <i> Yes, sir.</i>

40:55.379 --> 40:56.839
Thank you, sir.

40:58.716 --> 41:01.468
- He's toying with you.
- This could be a legitimate safety issue.

41:01.468 --> 41:04.346
He wants a seat back at the
table. Those plants are fine.

41:04.471 --> 41:06.431
Why is he doing this?
We've had our differences,

41:06.431 --> 41:07.974
but something drastic like this?

41:08.099 --> 41:12.020
Well, I did tell him
about the possible FERC action.

41:12.145 --> 41:15.356
- You did what?
- He called me, I answered the call.

41:15.481 --> 41:16.691
Why didn't you inform me
immediately?

41:16.816 --> 41:18.776
He told me you had
a productive talk,

41:18.901 --> 41:20.736
that he was on board
with the subsidy.

41:20.861 --> 41:23.155
I assumed everything was fine.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.866
He was proposing renewed trade
talks. We didn't talk about subsidy at all.

41:25.991 --> 41:29.202
He's playing both of us then.

41:29.327 --> 41:31.663
If he told you he was on board,
why'd you bring up FERC?

41:31.704 --> 41:35.082
I told him I was relieved, that we
could've taken action if he didn't comply.

41:35.249 --> 41:37.251
You think he's fishing, to see
what our next move might be?

41:37.376 --> 41:41.714
I think so, sir. I mean, he is lying
about those two plants in the South.

41:41.797 --> 41:43.757
But we can't guess.
We have to be certain.

41:43.882 --> 41:46.343
Do you want Raymond Tusk
to assess that risk,

41:46.468 --> 41:48.136
or the United States government?

41:48.261 --> 41:50.180
Are you suggesting
we take over his facilities?

41:50.305 --> 41:51.931
There is precedent there.

41:52.056 --> 41:54.976
Woodrow Wilson did it with the
railroads for three full years.

41:55.101 --> 41:56.560
In a time of war.

41:56.727 --> 41:59.980
In a time of emergency,
which is what this is.

42:00.105 --> 42:04.192
The country needs a leader,
Mr. President. Give them one.

42:04.318 --> 42:07.487
Do not bend to Raymond Tusk.

42:16.787 --> 42:18.789
I'm done.

42:21.792 --> 42:24.169
- I said you might not like it.
- It makes me seem crazy.

42:24.294 --> 42:27.214
This is the most
toned-down version.

42:27.339 --> 42:31.384
I tried to be as kind as I
could without being biased.

42:31.509 --> 42:34.053
I don't think you want this
going out into the world.

42:34.178 --> 42:36.222
Can I talk to Janine?

42:45.355 --> 42:46.648
Tell him to go.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.739
He wants you to leave.

43:02.704 --> 43:04.706
- You lied.
- Luca...

43:04.790 --> 43:06.708
You lied to Tom.
You lied to the US attorney.

43:06.791 --> 43:07.792
I didn't know what else to do.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.127
Tell the truth.

43:11.379 --> 43:12.630
They'll arrest me.

43:12.755 --> 43:14.757
They'll discredit
everything I say.

43:14.882 --> 43:17.802
And nobody is going to believe
me more than they believe you.

43:17.885 --> 43:20.679
But we can get the story out there.
Get people asking questions.

43:20.804 --> 43:25.684
No. It'll just look like
two crazy people instead of one.

43:28.436 --> 43:30.855
So you're saving yourself.

43:30.980 --> 43:33.983
I'm trying to save
the both of us.

43:37.319 --> 43:40.698
Please. Take the plea.

43:40.823 --> 43:43.450
- I'm not guilty.
- You are.

43:43.575 --> 43:46.661
You committed a crime.
Multiple crimes.

43:46.786 --> 43:49.456
Not murder.

43:50.832 --> 43:56.337
Take the plea. Be good.
Get out early.

43:58.839 --> 44:01.633
Everybody...
everybody's fucked me.

44:01.800 --> 44:05.220
If I was trying to fuck you,
I wouldn't be here.

44:06.763 --> 44:09.391
He's gonna get away with it,
isn't he?

44:12.935 --> 44:14.979
Yes.

44:15.855 --> 44:17.857
He is.

44:27.616 --> 44:30.952
- I'll take an iced tea if you have any.
- We don't.

44:35.081 --> 44:38.751
I wish I didn't have to keep coming
through back doors like this.

44:38.876 --> 44:41.628
Well, we wouldn't want our
friends in the fourth estate

44:41.795 --> 44:44.298
to know you were here, would we?
Especially since you've gone

44:44.423 --> 44:49.219
to such lengths to remain
above the fray of politics.

44:49.344 --> 44:51.888
You can't seize
the plants, Frank.

44:52.013 --> 44:53.806
We haven't seized anything yet.

44:53.890 --> 44:56.684
We're ready to, but we won't...
if you cooperate.

44:56.809 --> 44:59.311
- It's illegal.
- It's not. You know that.

44:59.436 --> 45:03.315
The president can issue an executive
order in times of emergency.

45:03.440 --> 45:06.693
- I'll fight it in court. - Which will take even
longer than a FERC investigation would.

45:06.818 --> 45:10.864
And in the meantime, you make
nothing from those plants.

45:10.947 --> 45:15.034
We agreed, right here
in this room,

45:15.159 --> 45:18.162
we agreed to work together.
We agreed as men of our word.

45:18.287 --> 45:20.956
And I held up my end of
that bargain until you abandoned me...

45:21.081 --> 45:22.833
I sent Remy to help you.

45:22.916 --> 45:25.335
After I got it passed through
the Senate, with no help from you.

45:25.460 --> 45:27.170
I had to protect my relationship
with the president.

45:27.295 --> 45:29.964
And then you tried to use me
during the summit in Spotsylvania.

45:30.090 --> 45:34.218
I was not put on this earth
to be your best friend,

45:34.343 --> 45:38.055
or to share every piece
of information I have with you.

45:38.180 --> 45:43.101
We agreed to a mutually
beneficial partnership,

45:43.227 --> 45:44.561
that's all.

45:46.438 --> 45:49.774
Yes, and what's
become very clear to me

45:49.858 --> 45:53.111
is that I benefit in no way
from this partnership.

45:53.236 --> 45:55.071
Let's not pretend to be naive.

45:55.238 --> 45:59.200
We both respect self-interest
above all else.

45:59.325 --> 46:05.956
Our versions of that
no longer align.

46:06.039 --> 46:11.252
You are on the verge of making an
irreversible mistake, Mr. Vice President.

46:11.377 --> 46:16.966
I may well be making a mistake.
Who knows?

46:17.091 --> 46:20.219
What I do know is that you'll be
calling Linda and telling her

46:20.386 --> 46:22.763
that you'll accept
the subsidies.

46:22.888 --> 46:28.059
You may have all the money, Raymond,
but I have all the men with guns.

46:28.226 --> 46:30.562
It's a burner.
Pre-dialed. She's expecting.

46:30.687 --> 46:34.982
Oh, and uh, yes...
from last night.

46:35.107 --> 46:39.320
The ball's in your court,
as they say.

46:56.794 --> 47:00.297
Oh, Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me.

47:02.007 --> 47:05.635
Are you supposed to take the
Lord's name in vain like that?

47:05.761 --> 47:08.013
- Leave it on.
- Costs too much.

47:08.138 --> 47:10.807
I'll take care of it.

47:14.936 --> 47:18.481
Goodwin took the plea.
He's going away.

47:18.606 --> 47:22.860
- So does that mean this is all over?
- No.

47:23.026 --> 47:25.737
- We still have to be careful.
- Well, why?

47:25.904 --> 47:28.031
If he's gone, then nobody's
looking for me, right?

47:28.114 --> 47:31.159
Not that we know of.
Until we know, nothing changes.

47:31.284 --> 47:33.161
So what, you just came over here
to get my hopes up?

47:33.286 --> 47:37.039
I came here to make sure that
you don't go to church tonight.

47:44.838 --> 47:47.215
Do you want to fuck me?

47:51.886 --> 47:54.972
- Is that what this is all about?
- No.

47:55.056 --> 47:58.392
- You've done it before.
- That was different.

48:07.943 --> 48:09.778
Stop it.

48:13.740 --> 48:17.159
If there's one thing I know,
it's when a man wants me.

48:31.756 --> 48:35.051
I learned who Rachel
was in church.

48:36.510 --> 48:39.263
She was young and beautiful.

48:39.388 --> 48:43.100
Jacob fell in love with her
while she was watering a lamb and...

48:43.225 --> 48:49.064
...she became his wife after he worked
seven years to earn her hand in marriage.

48:50.857 --> 48:56.320
Rachel had one son, Joseph.

48:56.445 --> 48:59.198
He became a king.

49:04.077 --> 49:06.163
Are you hungry?

49:15.087 --> 49:23.428
