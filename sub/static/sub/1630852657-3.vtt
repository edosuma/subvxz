00:06.166 --> 00:07.083
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:07.166 --> 00:10.916
Guys, I hope you've slept well
and had a nice breakfast,

00:11.000 --> 00:12.833
because today will be tough.

00:12.916 --> 00:14.458
We'll have twice as much work.

00:15.041 --> 00:17.708
Today's Shell Island's anniversary.

00:17.791 --> 00:19.458
We are celebrating.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.708
-Yay!
-Great!

00:20.791 --> 00:22.666
So these are your tasks:

00:22.750 --> 00:25.083
Diego, you'll supervise today's dives.

00:25.166 --> 00:27.708
Marília, mention our tours
in the yoga classes.

00:27.791 --> 00:29.416
Helena, at the restaurant.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.416
And Miguel-- Where's he?

00:32.916 --> 00:36.375
Relax, Miguel's here. Don't worry.
I already know, boss.

00:36.458 --> 00:38.708
I'll stay at the bar, right? Morning!

00:40.416 --> 00:44.708
So you said you were mugged,
and used our money to buy a bag?

00:46.500 --> 00:48.166
Yasmin, it was already mine.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.583
I brought it when I came here.

00:50.666 --> 00:53.625
What about this tag?
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:53.708 --> 00:55.208
No, let me explain!

00:55.291 --> 00:57.583
I regret it, I swear.
I know this is wrong.

00:57.666 --> 01:01.208
-I couldn't help it, it's a long story.
-We're living in this heat--

01:01.291 --> 01:04.125
-I'll tell them.
-No! Yasmin, wait! Calm down.

01:04.208 --> 01:06.250
-What's up, guys?
-Hi, honey.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.500
Ready for the most romantic day
of the season?

01:10.083 --> 01:11.708
Where's Yasmin?

01:12.583 --> 01:14.125
Are you locking us in here?

01:14.208 --> 01:17.000
Wait, let me-- Let's talk.
Give me some time.

01:17.083 --> 01:19.833
-I'll fix this.
-You're crazy!

01:19.916 --> 01:21.250
Please…

01:24.750 --> 01:27.083
Yasmin, give it to me, please!

01:27.583 --> 01:30.541
-Give it to me!
-I'll solve this!

01:31.708 --> 01:33.125
Yasmin, come back here!

01:33.666 --> 01:35.083
Vilma, I need to talk to you.

01:35.958 --> 01:37.333
Hi, Yasmin.

01:37.416 --> 01:41.166
How about taking underwater pictures?

01:41.666 --> 01:45.166
Today's the perfect day
for sea lovers like us, Big Rider.

01:45.875 --> 01:48.666
I've brought you this article
about the island's fauna.

01:48.750 --> 01:49.875
It's pretty cool.

01:50.583 --> 01:51.708
Nice, Maresia.

01:53.791 --> 01:55.791
Yasmin, were you going to say something?

01:57.333 --> 02:00.458
No, it's nothing. I'll tell you later.

02:02.791 --> 02:03.791
Okay.

02:03.875 --> 02:06.375
-Shall we, guys? Let's get to work.
-Yes.

03:00.708 --> 03:01.541
Hassef?

03:02.041 --> 03:04.208
It's working, right?

03:04.291 --> 03:09.125
You should know these little gifts
are draining away the defense money.

03:09.208 --> 03:10.541
<i>Hassef, listen to me.</i>

03:10.625 --> 03:12.458
I need to talk to my clients,

03:12.541 --> 03:15.375
or people will talk shit to the police.

03:15.458 --> 03:17.833
<i>-Is that what you want?</i>
-You're right, Cecília.

03:17.916 --> 03:20.541
But do you want a friendly advice?

03:21.125 --> 03:23.250
Use the phone to talk to your daughter.

03:24.125 --> 03:26.208
<i>She needs attention, okay?</i>

03:33.875 --> 03:35.125
Good morning!

03:36.583 --> 03:41.208
I never thought you'd go back
to that story about being a surfer.

03:41.291 --> 03:44.333
So you move in
to your rich dad's beach house

03:44.416 --> 03:45.416
and become a pothead.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.041
It's so cliché that it makes me angry.

03:48.875 --> 03:49.958
Give me that.

03:50.916 --> 03:52.291
Look at this.

03:53.416 --> 03:56.333
It must be that thug's,
the fisherman's son.

03:57.041 --> 03:59.333
-Dad, Miguel--
-Listen up, Rodrigo!

03:59.416 --> 04:01.125
This is the last time I say this.

04:01.208 --> 04:05.166
I don't want you anywhere
near Miguel, okay? Ever.

04:05.958 --> 04:08.208
Get dressed,
we'll go to the island's party.

04:26.375 --> 04:27.916
Many centuries ago,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.958
Manuel Dias, who discovered Shell Island,

04:31.041 --> 04:34.583
was isolated and seriously injured
after a shipwreck.

04:34.666 --> 04:38.750
So he gathered all his strength
to throw a canoe at sea.

04:39.375 --> 04:41.958
Inside the canoe, they found a letter

04:42.041 --> 04:44.666
that he had written
to his beloved in Portugal.

04:44.750 --> 04:47.666
And today you're invited to do the same

04:47.750 --> 04:50.166
and throw our "love boat" at sea.

04:51.041 --> 04:54.375
Enjoy, because according to the legend,

04:54.458 --> 04:57.250
the couple that carves
their initials on the boat

04:57.333 --> 04:58.916
will find eternal love.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.916
So let's enjoy this magical day.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.458
It's a day to celebrate. Have fun!

05:04.000 --> 05:04.833
Yes!

05:09.333 --> 05:10.291
Catarina.

05:14.708 --> 05:16.708
Catarina, come back.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.500
Don't you run away from me.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.166
UNKNOWN CALLER

05:41.208 --> 05:42.041
Hello?

05:42.125 --> 05:43.791
<i>-Catarina?</i>
-Mom?

05:44.541 --> 05:47.333
<i>-</i>Is that you?
-Honey, I don't have much time.

05:47.416 --> 05:49.625
But we really need to talk.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.625
Yes, Mom. Yes.

05:52.416 --> 05:53.958
I have so much to tell you.

05:54.541 --> 05:58.291
Honey, I know you really wanted
to go to Switzerland,

05:58.375 --> 06:01.250
<i>but Mommy had to reallocate that money.</i>

06:01.333 --> 06:03.875
Forget that, Mom, okay? I--

06:04.625 --> 06:07.041
Yes, the school was very important to me,

06:07.125 --> 06:09.791
but we don't need to talk about this now.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.375
I want to know about you.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.000
<i>Are they treating you well?</i>

06:14.500 --> 06:17.166
Yes, I mean-- Yeah,
they're treating me well.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.625
Of course they're treating me well. I--

06:20.375 --> 06:22.875
I even have a new pillow,

06:22.958 --> 06:24.875
<i>can you believe it, sweetie?</i>

06:27.083 --> 06:28.208
Catarina,

06:28.291 --> 06:32.000
I know you miss Mommy,
and Mommy misses you, too.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.291
But right now we need to talk
about money, okay?

06:35.375 --> 06:39.000
<i>Specially now that you've ended</i>
<i>your engagement with Rodrigo.</i>

06:39.083 --> 06:41.833
Think about your future. Huh?

06:41.916 --> 06:44.916
Rodrigo is the solution
to all your problems.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.208
Yes, honey. It's every man for himself.

06:49.000 --> 06:49.833
Remember?

06:52.208 --> 06:53.125
Wow.

06:54.875 --> 06:57.041
I've waited so long to talk to you.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.833
And that's what you had to say?

06:58.916 --> 07:00.916
<i>-Is that all?</i>
-Please, Catarina.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.666
Nothing new happens around here.

07:07.958 --> 07:10.708
People need me here, I'm gonna hang up.

07:10.791 --> 07:14.000
We'll talk later. Bye. I miss you.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.708
Wait, Catarina.

07:16.708 --> 07:17.541
<i>Catari--</i>

07:18.750 --> 07:20.583
Catarina? Honey?

07:22.541 --> 07:23.458
Damn it.

07:32.458 --> 07:33.291
I'm done.

07:34.458 --> 07:36.333
I'm done playing hide-and-seek.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.583
I won't tell on you.

07:40.791 --> 07:41.958
On one condition.

07:43.666 --> 07:45.083
You take the pictures.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.458
Is that all? Okay.

07:49.583 --> 07:50.625
Here.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.958
Hey. Good morning.

08:16.041 --> 08:18.541
Marília "Namastension". How are you?

08:18.625 --> 08:20.208
Someone's inspired today.

08:21.416 --> 08:22.416
With you, always.

08:23.791 --> 08:24.791
Come here.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.833
Let's see if you

08:28.291 --> 08:29.250
can do it.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.958
-There you go!
-Pay attention.

08:34.041 --> 08:36.416
Focus.

08:36.500 --> 08:40.666
-What are you doing, Diego?
-Come here. Come.

08:42.125 --> 08:43.041
Look.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.375
What a hook!

08:49.291 --> 08:51.000
Ouch!

08:54.125 --> 08:55.875
-Are you okay?
-Better now.

08:58.458 --> 09:00.125
I'm sorry about yesterday.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.458
You were telling me about your dreams,

09:02.541 --> 09:04.125
and I reacted badly.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.875
Do you wanna talk about it?

09:07.375 --> 09:10.250
No. I don't wanna fight right now.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.333
-But--
-It's a day to celebrate. It's fine.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.666
-We've talked about it.
-Who said we'll fight?

09:16.750 --> 09:18.125
Ta-da!

09:18.208 --> 09:21.416
Guess who's the new hotel's photographer?

09:24.375 --> 09:25.583
I switched with Yasmin.

09:26.458 --> 09:29.375
All right.
Let's get to work then, photographer.

09:31.708 --> 09:35.375
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Maresia Boat.

09:35.458 --> 09:38.166
Pay attention to our safety instructions.

09:38.250 --> 09:42.750
Hold on to your life jackets
as if they were shoes on sale.

09:44.833 --> 09:47.125
If you swallow water through the snorkel,

09:47.208 --> 09:50.291
keep calm, spit it through the straw,
and move on.

09:50.375 --> 09:51.250
Welcome.

09:52.041 --> 09:54.041
Hi. Welcome.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.208
Nice to meet you.

09:56.125 --> 09:57.208
<i>Bienvenida.</i>

09:58.041 --> 09:59.375
Careful there, please.

09:59.916 --> 10:03.583
I've never seen so much enthusiasm
to pass safety instructions.

10:04.458 --> 10:05.500
I'm trying hard.

10:06.666 --> 10:10.083
I've decided to lead my life,
instead of letting it lead me.

10:10.166 --> 10:11.000
Mafalda, right?

10:12.791 --> 10:15.625
-Guys, are you ready?
-Smile!

10:21.208 --> 10:22.625
Come on. I'll help you.

10:22.708 --> 10:23.666
<i>Gracias.</i>

10:28.500 --> 10:29.458
Here you go.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.250
Your green piña colada.

10:31.750 --> 10:32.625
<i>Merci.</i>

10:37.000 --> 10:39.916
Miguel, who's that hottie
from bungalow six?

10:40.416 --> 10:42.708
Do you think he's hot?

10:45.666 --> 10:47.708
I can't be your cupid now,

10:47.791 --> 10:49.875
I gotta help on the love boat.

10:51.583 --> 10:54.125
If they ask you about
the green piña colada,

10:54.625 --> 10:56.708
tell them the man is back on business.

10:56.791 --> 10:57.916
Got it?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.666
-Huh? Got it?
-Fine.

10:59.750 --> 11:00.916
See you later.

11:02.250 --> 11:04.916
Slowly stretch your spine.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.791
Stretch your arms up.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.458
Above your head.

11:13.083 --> 11:14.541
Say your prayers.

11:16.333 --> 11:19.125
Take your hands to your heart chakra.

11:20.083 --> 11:21.916
And be grateful.

11:24.958 --> 11:26.333
Gratitude for this day.

11:27.541 --> 11:28.916
The leaflets.

11:29.666 --> 11:30.500
Guys,

11:31.083 --> 11:32.250
this is Conrado.

11:32.333 --> 11:35.125
These are our special activities
in the island, okay?

11:35.208 --> 11:36.583
You can take a leaflet.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.291
Have a good dive. Good afternoon.

11:43.166 --> 11:44.083
Good afternoon.

11:54.916 --> 11:57.708
If you want, I can give you all his info.

11:58.875 --> 12:01.625
-He's single.
-Why are you telling me this?

12:02.833 --> 12:04.458
You guys are flirting.

12:04.541 --> 12:07.041
-Helena told me you--
-Helena what?

12:08.166 --> 12:09.666
What did Helena tell you?

12:11.041 --> 12:14.458
Nothing. I think I'm confused, that's all.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.291
I'm sorry, buddy.

12:17.375 --> 12:18.291
It's fine.

12:40.625 --> 12:41.458
You silly!

12:41.541 --> 12:43.208
-Did you like it?
-Yes.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.500
-I lost my bracelet.
-I'll find it for you.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.166
No, Diego!

12:51.000 --> 12:54.125
-Diego. Don't worry, relax.
-Why?

12:54.958 --> 12:57.041
Let it go, it doesn't make sense anymore.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.208
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

12:59.958 --> 13:03.750
I don't care about jewelry anymore.
What would Mom say? Let's go.

13:05.000 --> 13:05.833
Let's go.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.458
Your mom gave you this bracelet?

13:12.541 --> 13:14.791
No. It was Rodrigo.

13:17.625 --> 13:20.333
What about you and Marília? Are you okay?

13:20.416 --> 13:23.041
It was weird between you two earlier.

13:23.541 --> 13:24.458
It was nothing.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.750
I was telling her

13:26.833 --> 13:30.583
that I want to be a lifeguard,
and she didn't like it.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.000
Am I crazy for wanting this?

13:38.083 --> 13:40.125
No. I think it's cool.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.750
Is it your childhood dream?

13:44.750 --> 13:48.166
It's a dream. Not a child's dream.

13:51.708 --> 13:53.541
Hey, where are you going?

14:07.541 --> 14:08.583
<i>Diego…</i>

14:11.666 --> 14:12.750
<i>Diego…</i>

14:13.875 --> 14:15.416
<i>Help me, brother.</i>

14:23.125 --> 14:24.291
<i>Help me.</i>

14:26.208 --> 14:27.833
<i>Help me, brother.</i>

14:29.166 --> 14:30.083
<i>Diego…</i>

14:31.583 --> 14:34.166
<i>Diego, help me, brother. Diego!</i>

14:58.416 --> 15:00.750
Finally! Here you are.

15:02.750 --> 15:06.583
Marília said you were upset,
but why hiding up here?

15:18.083 --> 15:19.625
Conrado, I'm a virgin.

15:22.041 --> 15:22.958
What?

15:23.041 --> 15:24.875
This is really tough for me.

15:25.708 --> 15:27.875
It's a real issue for me, you know?

15:28.625 --> 15:31.250
Anyway, I came to the island
to change that.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.875
It'll be tonight with the hottie
from bungalow six.

15:33.958 --> 15:35.625
Why are you telling me this?

15:37.541 --> 15:38.500
I don't know.

15:39.291 --> 15:41.833
I didn't want you to think
I gossiped about you.

15:41.916 --> 15:44.166
I thought I should tell you my secret.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.750
I don't have any secrets.

15:47.666 --> 15:49.333
I don't know why you think so.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.041
Is this your phone? Look.

15:57.416 --> 16:00.958
These TV shows
will make you feel better. Here you go.

16:01.041 --> 16:04.041
<i>Sense8, Sex Education--</i>

16:04.125 --> 16:07.333
<i>-</i>This one is amazing! It made me cry.
<i>-</i>Stop it, Helena!

16:07.916 --> 16:08.750
Stop.

16:16.083 --> 16:16.916
Listen,

16:18.125 --> 16:19.041
I know

16:19.916 --> 16:23.000
that sometimes we get confused
about our crushes.

16:28.208 --> 16:30.416
I thought you were confused, too.

16:58.750 --> 16:59.916
Yasmin.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.666
-Hi.
-Did they cancel the morning tour?

17:03.750 --> 17:07.333
No, they didn't.
I just switched with Catarina.

17:07.416 --> 17:11.083
There are foreigners in the group,
so she'll translate.

17:11.166 --> 17:14.041
What a pity.
I wanted to see your pictures.

17:15.125 --> 17:18.708
-You can go in the afternoon dive.
-Yes, sure.

17:19.958 --> 17:21.791
The sea is my natural <i>habitat</i>.

17:22.625 --> 17:26.500
That's awesome, Big Rider.
I'm gonna tie this rope.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.541
Sneakers on the beach?

17:29.833 --> 17:32.750
-Don't you wanna walk on the sand?
-I'll do that.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.375
Hey, what happened?

18:03.458 --> 18:04.500
Are you okay?

18:05.416 --> 18:06.250
Yeah.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.291
What's up, guys? What's good?

18:19.833 --> 18:24.708
We were talking about
the story of the island.

18:24.791 --> 18:29.000
It's weird that the island just appeared
after Europeans came here.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.166
I agree with you.

18:34.291 --> 18:37.625
Actually, the natives have
a much more beautiful story.

18:38.125 --> 18:39.916
I can tell you if you want to.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.375
Yes! I love Conrado's excitement.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.250
-Stop it.
-I'll tell because you asked. Come on.

18:50.333 --> 18:51.583
-Stop it.
-What are you…

18:51.666 --> 18:53.416
-Come down.
-Why all this?

18:53.500 --> 18:56.625
-Come on, Conrado.
-Wait up.

18:57.333 --> 19:00.166
-Yes, one, two, three, go!
-Hold on!

19:00.250 --> 19:02.750
Come on, Conrado!

19:04.625 --> 19:05.500
One day,

19:06.500 --> 19:09.333
a witch who was forbidden
to dive in the sea

19:10.458 --> 19:13.083
left the forest
where she used to cast her spells

19:13.666 --> 19:16.000
to risk and make her first dive.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.750
-This is the witch.
-The witch.

19:18.833 --> 19:21.208
-Cute.
-Conrado is following the story.

19:21.791 --> 19:23.833
Come here.

19:25.708 --> 19:27.625
As soon as she dived in the sea,

19:28.708 --> 19:30.791
they fell deeply in love with each other.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.458
However, Conrado,

19:35.791 --> 19:39.250
they soon realized
it was an impossible love.

19:40.166 --> 19:42.958
They came from very different worlds.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.125
So the witch went back

19:46.750 --> 19:48.666
to the forest where she lived,

19:49.166 --> 19:52.791
and cried for days, months, years,

19:52.875 --> 19:56.166
until her sweet tears turned into a river.

19:57.000 --> 19:57.958
And the river…

20:01.458 --> 20:02.583
met the sea.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.166
Is that all? I thought he'd tell a joke.

20:11.250 --> 20:15.291
-He's always the funny man--
-So, this is what you think of me?

20:15.375 --> 20:17.375
Yeah, I also think it was kind of--

20:17.875 --> 20:20.125
-What?
-It didn't move me.

20:20.208 --> 20:21.500
You must improve that story.

20:21.583 --> 20:24.875
Okay. I'll take you both
to meet the witch.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.375
-What?
-Stop!

20:26.458 --> 20:30.333
-Stop it!
-Come here!

20:33.083 --> 20:35.833
These are the witch's tears, Conrado!

20:35.916 --> 20:38.250
Wait. What are you doing?

20:38.916 --> 20:39.750
Fuck!

20:40.833 --> 20:43.708
-What?
-Now I'm all wet!

20:43.791 --> 20:45.166
-Fuck you!
-Conrado--

20:45.250 --> 20:46.666
-Fuck me?
-Damn it!

20:46.750 --> 20:49.791
-We were just having fun!
-Stop it, man!

20:49.875 --> 20:51.708
-Conrado, what the hell?
-Guys.

20:52.291 --> 20:55.041
-Let it go, Miguel. I'll talk to him.
-Hey!

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
I don't know
if there are candles for everyone.

21:16.583 --> 21:19.875
-I can ask someone to go buy it.
-No need. Come here.

21:20.375 --> 21:25.500
Stay here. Not everyone needs
to find eternal love, like us.

21:30.833 --> 21:31.916
Thank you, honey,

21:33.541 --> 21:36.166
for understanding
the situation about Yasmin.

21:36.250 --> 21:37.666
Yeah, baby, I--

21:38.500 --> 21:41.541
I'd like to talk to you about it.
Is that okay?

21:43.375 --> 21:45.916
I found a lab in Florianópolis.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.750
They do paternity tests.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.916
I know it's a tricky subject,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.833
but you're creating too many expectations
on Yasmin, Maresia.

21:55.333 --> 21:57.041
What if none of this is real?

21:59.375 --> 22:00.708
I worry about you.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.375
DNA PATERNITY TEST

22:24.875 --> 22:26.458
Did you find him?

22:26.541 --> 22:29.875
No, his profile hasn't showed up yet.
I have to get closer.

22:29.958 --> 22:32.250
-I can't believe this.
-Well, let's go.

22:37.583 --> 22:38.750
He'll notice.

22:39.666 --> 22:42.333
Not yet.
I don't understand this app, Marília.

22:42.416 --> 22:44.958
-As if you've never used it.
-I haven't. You know why?

22:45.041 --> 22:48.166
In the movies, couples have
very romantic dates.

22:48.250 --> 22:51.500
At companies, funerals,
traveling through time--

22:51.583 --> 22:53.833
-It's so beautiful.
-This is real life.

22:53.916 --> 22:57.666
People meet their kids' father
through apps.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.291
Okay. So where is he?

22:59.375 --> 23:02.041
-Do you need help?
-Helena does.

23:02.125 --> 23:03.458
-Does she?
-Yeah.

23:03.541 --> 23:04.416
I do.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.333
-I can help you.
-Yeah.

23:12.333 --> 23:14.333
-It's great. Thank you.
-Thank you.

23:15.458 --> 23:18.666
-What do I do?
-Keep looking at him. He'll look at you.

23:18.750 --> 23:21.583
-Do I touch my hair?
-Yes, smile.

23:21.666 --> 23:23.291
Oh God, I feel ridiculous.

23:23.375 --> 23:26.416
Okay, so let's do this
the traditional way. Here.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.916
"Are you up for grabs?" No, Marília!

23:29.000 --> 23:32.208
-You're not sending this.
-Trust me, it'll work.

23:32.291 --> 23:33.375
Trust me.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.916
Do you want to see? Look.

23:41.666 --> 23:42.541
-Here.
-Wait.

23:43.375 --> 23:44.916
He wants to meet me later?

23:45.666 --> 23:48.083
He wants to meet me later!

23:49.625 --> 23:50.500
See?

24:08.458 --> 24:10.666
-Are you watching <i>Queer Eye</i>?
-No.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.541
For decoration tips?

24:12.625 --> 24:14.666
No, this is--

24:15.250 --> 24:16.666
Anyway, Helena.

24:17.583 --> 24:21.083
She asked me to watch this, so--

24:21.166 --> 24:23.500
-Did you like it?
-Well,

24:24.041 --> 24:27.333
they said something
that really changed my life.

24:27.416 --> 24:28.250
What?

24:28.833 --> 24:31.916
Rolling up your sleeves
always improves your look.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.083
Oh, wow. I'll do that!

24:36.000 --> 24:38.833
Not to be unfair with the show,

24:39.375 --> 24:42.125
because of them, I remembered a passage

24:43.541 --> 24:45.291
that I love, which is,

24:47.333 --> 24:49.250
"There is no fear in love."

24:50.416 --> 24:52.125
"There is no fear in love."

24:54.083 --> 24:58.208
I wrote something a while back
that sounds like that.

24:58.708 --> 25:00.416
Do you write poetry?

25:01.125 --> 25:02.750
Now I want to hear it.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.041
<i>I don't want to be afraid</i>

25:07.791 --> 25:09.458
<i>Nor be your secret</i>

25:10.291 --> 25:12.333
<i>Is it too late or is it too early?</i>

25:13.166 --> 25:16.166
<i>Do I deserve to be loved?</i>

25:16.833 --> 25:21.083
<i>Even having scars and after some crises</i>
<i>Do I deserve to be loved?</i>

25:21.583 --> 25:22.791
<i>My nana used to say</i>

25:22.875 --> 25:26.666
<i>"People who love, suffer</i>
<i>But they never forget"</i>

25:26.750 --> 25:28.166
<i>It's for real people</i>

25:28.750 --> 25:31.625
<i>And life is only worth it</i>
<i>When we feel</i>

25:33.333 --> 25:34.416
<i>For real, though</i>

25:35.750 --> 25:40.041
<i>If there's one single thing I deserve</i>

25:40.125 --> 25:43.000
<i>It is to be loved</i>

25:49.083 --> 25:50.208
It's so beautiful.

25:51.708 --> 25:52.583
Thank you.

25:53.666 --> 25:54.833
It's crazy, isn't it?

25:55.416 --> 25:56.958
This need

25:57.541 --> 26:00.375
of spitting out everything
that is inside us.

26:01.416 --> 26:03.166
What's inside you,

26:04.583 --> 26:05.791
is it about Miguel?

26:12.208 --> 26:14.458
Since I got here in this island, I've--

26:15.833 --> 26:17.958
I've always done what Miguel wanted,

26:18.458 --> 26:19.458
without thinking.

26:22.958 --> 26:25.625
-I saw you looking at him.
-Me?

26:26.208 --> 26:28.625
-Yes.
-No, I wasn't.

26:29.333 --> 26:30.458
I have a boyfriend.

26:32.083 --> 26:34.208
-Really?
-Yes, really.

26:36.458 --> 26:37.416
His name's Chai.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.166
Where is he? In São Paulo?

26:42.166 --> 26:43.083
No.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.750
I don't know where he is.

26:46.416 --> 26:47.583
He's on the run.

26:49.541 --> 26:50.958
You don't need to worry.

26:51.041 --> 26:52.666
It was nothing serious,

26:52.750 --> 26:55.916
he broke a window during a protest.
Nothing serious.

26:57.166 --> 26:59.125
-What do you mean, "hum"?
-What?

26:59.208 --> 27:00.208
Don't be scared.

27:00.291 --> 27:03.250
Cheer up, we need
to carry a thousand oysters.

27:03.333 --> 27:05.750
-Right, the police--
-Police?

27:05.833 --> 27:09.375
Vilma will kill us
if we don't do this. Come on.

27:28.708 --> 27:30.125
Here you go, Mr. Elias.

27:30.625 --> 27:32.250
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

27:34.458 --> 27:36.750
-Here you go, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

27:54.750 --> 27:56.208
-Hey. What's up?
-Hi!

27:56.291 --> 27:59.250
I heard about a green piña colada.
Can you help me?

27:59.333 --> 28:01.041
Yes, but come back later.

28:01.125 --> 28:03.250
-The green one.
-Come back later.

28:03.333 --> 28:04.583
Later, please.

28:10.833 --> 28:16.083
Look, this guy is looking hot!
You even look like a real man.

28:16.166 --> 28:17.000
Very funny.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.958
Can you make me a gin and tonic?

28:19.041 --> 28:21.375
-A small one, in the can.
-Okay. Sure.

28:30.083 --> 28:33.500
I'm telling you, it's impossible
to be Elias Aguiar's son.

28:33.583 --> 28:36.708
What about being the poor friend
of Elias Aguiar's son?

28:36.791 --> 28:40.500
Remember when you lent me your bike?
He thought I had robbed you.

28:41.958 --> 28:43.666
I'd be careful if I were you.

28:44.625 --> 28:45.791
He's watching you.

28:45.875 --> 28:49.083
Why are you saying that?
Does he know about me?

28:49.166 --> 28:52.041
What are you doing?
Do you want him to find out?

28:52.833 --> 28:55.750
Listen up, he talked to me this morning.

28:55.833 --> 28:58.958
I said you weren't involved.
I'm your friend, man.

29:02.583 --> 29:03.625
Relax, okay?

29:15.375 --> 29:17.208
You should hide pretty well.

29:17.291 --> 29:21.500
If I find you,
I'll make an <i>empanada</i> out of you!

29:22.416 --> 29:24.958
-Found you!
-Let her go!

29:25.041 --> 29:27.166
Let my daughter go!

29:27.250 --> 29:29.333
Go, honey! Run!

29:30.250 --> 29:32.666
I don't know who's the child,
you or my daughter.

29:32.750 --> 29:34.125
You're not far behind.

29:34.916 --> 29:35.833
Do you think?

29:37.125 --> 29:40.500
It's been a while
since I saw you like this, so playful.

29:41.166 --> 29:43.833
-I like it.
-I love it.

29:48.250 --> 29:51.125
This picture is so cute!

29:51.208 --> 29:53.125
Gringo, you have to see…

30:06.083 --> 30:06.916
Yasmin.

30:07.583 --> 30:08.708
Can I talk to you?

30:09.208 --> 30:11.125
I'm working right now, Catarina.

30:12.208 --> 30:13.666
Do you know what day it is?

30:15.458 --> 30:18.083
The day that the settlers
invaded the island?

30:18.166 --> 30:19.000
Nope.

30:20.541 --> 30:23.916
I was supposed to be on a plane,
going to Switzerland,

30:24.500 --> 30:25.750
to conquer the world.

30:27.291 --> 30:28.291
But I'm here.

30:30.250 --> 30:31.875
This day sucks, Yasmin.

30:31.958 --> 30:34.708
I'm not okay, there's only one dive left.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.083
Can you do this for me?

30:36.166 --> 30:38.666
Are you crazy?
Did you forget I can tell your secret?

30:38.750 --> 30:41.500
Really, Yasmin?
Why are you blackmailing me?

30:41.583 --> 30:43.875
It's a dive, this should be fun.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.083
Are you afraid of water?

30:49.250 --> 30:50.416
Look, Catarina,

30:51.375 --> 30:53.041
I can't swim, okay?

30:54.083 --> 30:55.875
It's a requirement to work here.

30:58.458 --> 30:59.375
Got it.

31:01.958 --> 31:03.916
That's why you didn't tell on me.

31:06.625 --> 31:10.000
Well, let's say we're even.

31:11.291 --> 31:13.083
You know what your problem is?

31:13.166 --> 31:14.000
Privilege.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.875
I've never had swimming classes.

31:17.958 --> 31:21.000
I saw the sea for the first time
when I got here.

31:22.750 --> 31:25.125
You want to conquer the world, see it all.

31:25.625 --> 31:27.875
But you don't look at people next to you.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.333
Listen.

31:30.416 --> 31:32.791
I can't tell Maresia that I can't swim.

31:32.875 --> 31:33.916
Why not?

31:36.166 --> 31:37.791
I have a lot to lose.

31:42.541 --> 31:45.375
I'm sorry, Yasmin,
but I can't do this today.

31:46.333 --> 31:49.208
In my world, it's every man for himself.

32:16.875 --> 32:19.500
Hey, translator! Where are you going?

32:19.583 --> 32:21.750
-I was--
-There are foreigners here.

32:24.250 --> 32:25.125
Have a nice day.

32:26.916 --> 32:27.750
Nice.

32:42.708 --> 32:45.083
What happened to the enthusiasm?

32:46.833 --> 32:47.708
Let's get to work.

32:47.791 --> 32:48.750
<i>Trabajar.</i>

33:25.208 --> 33:27.291
Miguel is selling this in here.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.333
You must fire him.

33:33.583 --> 33:37.583
-Why do you think it's Miguel's?
-I know him since he was a kid.

33:37.666 --> 33:39.458
This fisherman's son is no good.

33:39.541 --> 33:42.166
Elias, I don't have proof against Miguel.

33:42.250 --> 33:45.625
You wiped out the village
to build your spa.

33:45.708 --> 33:49.291
They don't have a place to live,
a place to work--

33:50.083 --> 33:52.250
Where will Miguel work if I fire him?

33:52.333 --> 33:54.916
I don't know,
but he won't destroy my hotel.

33:56.666 --> 33:58.500
Rodrigo told you that, right?

33:59.125 --> 34:02.708
You must've found this at home,
he said it was Miguel's,

34:03.416 --> 34:04.791
and you believed him.

34:07.041 --> 34:07.875
Right?

34:10.333 --> 34:14.375
Look who's destroying your hotel.

34:14.958 --> 34:17.541
This is Rodrigo's room, it's a mess.

34:20.333 --> 34:23.583
I'm really upset
to see that you and Rodrigo

34:24.583 --> 34:28.791
need to destroy something
from time to time to feel better.

34:36.666 --> 34:38.250
Hey, Dad!

34:39.666 --> 34:41.875
Let's go home.
I'm not in the mood for parties.

34:41.958 --> 34:44.291
And you think I'm in the mood for parties?

34:44.375 --> 34:46.833
You didn't realize I spent
the whole day working,

34:46.916 --> 34:49.750
talking to people to move on
with the construction.

34:49.833 --> 34:52.458
-What did you do today?
-What the hell?

34:52.541 --> 34:54.708
I said I'm sorry,
I'm no longer Miguel's friend.

34:54.791 --> 34:57.208
You should be friends,
you're very much alike.

34:58.416 --> 35:01.291
You had a brilliant future ahead of you.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.208
But what did you achieve? Nothing.

35:04.875 --> 35:07.250
Not even those surf trophies.

35:07.333 --> 35:10.416
-What are you talking about?
-Exactly what you're thinking.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.166
When your daddy is the sponsor,

35:13.666 --> 35:16.375
it's easy to be the champion. You know?

35:17.875 --> 35:21.541
The gravy train is over.
Tomorrow you'll start working with me.

36:09.208 --> 36:10.208
Yasmin.

36:11.333 --> 36:13.041
They want a picture over there.

36:46.083 --> 36:47.833
You think you know me, right?

36:48.500 --> 36:49.500
I'm doing this.

37:10.208 --> 37:11.875
<i>Nothing</i>

37:18.500 --> 37:19.375
<i>It was</i>

37:21.041 --> 37:22.833
<i>It was the pain</i>

37:25.291 --> 37:29.041
<i>Of the witch that made her cry</i>

37:32.375 --> 37:37.500
<i>Hoping that someday her tears</i>

37:38.208 --> 37:43.916
<i>Could get to the sea</i>

37:46.166 --> 37:48.375
-Very good!
-Hey, Miguel.

37:49.333 --> 37:50.458
You wrote that?

37:51.083 --> 37:53.500
No, I'm just checking the sound.

37:57.083 --> 37:59.333
What's up with that guitar? Is it yours?

37:59.416 --> 38:02.291
It doesn't have an owner,
but it's got history.

38:02.375 --> 38:04.875
It passed through
many talented people's hands.

38:05.958 --> 38:07.208
And now, Conrado,

38:09.083 --> 38:09.916
it's yours.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.458
Thanks, man.

38:20.875 --> 38:21.875
Miguel, you--

38:23.708 --> 38:24.833
You didn't have to.

38:26.500 --> 38:27.666
Thank you.

38:27.750 --> 38:28.958
Conrado, I realized…

38:31.041 --> 38:33.416
music is really important to you.

38:36.333 --> 38:38.291
I wanna know the end of the story

38:38.958 --> 38:41.583
of your song about a myth with no logic.

38:44.250 --> 38:48.208
I've cared so much about logic
that I don't even know, man.

38:50.208 --> 38:51.500
I don't know--

38:51.583 --> 38:54.125
Then you started singing about love--

38:55.625 --> 38:59.041
Do you think I'm stupid?
You rolled up your sleeves,

38:59.958 --> 39:02.375
you unbuttoned your shirt…

39:06.750 --> 39:07.708
You're the C.

39:08.791 --> 39:10.833
From the boat. C + Y. I saw it.

39:12.375 --> 39:13.416
What do you mean?

39:15.083 --> 39:18.083
Conrado is in love with Yasmin!

39:18.166 --> 39:20.625
Who would've thought!

39:21.875 --> 39:23.416
-Come on now.
-No.

39:23.500 --> 39:27.250
I wanna know if the guitar is tuned
and the end of the song.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.166
-Stand up.
-But there's no--

39:29.708 --> 39:33.125
-I was just checking.
-Okay, but you can follow the idea.

39:33.208 --> 39:35.708
I'll be right here listening. Go ahead.

39:38.208 --> 39:39.041
Okay.

39:52.208 --> 39:54.250
<i>It was the pain</i>

39:54.333 --> 39:58.708
<i>Of the witch that made her cry</i>

39:58.791 --> 40:03.750
<i>Hoping that someday her tears</i>

40:03.833 --> 40:07.333
<i>Could get to the sea</i>

40:11.083 --> 40:12.958
<i>A sad end</i>

40:13.041 --> 40:17.916
<i>For someone who couldn't give in to love</i>

40:18.666 --> 40:21.000
<i>As someone who</i>

40:21.083 --> 40:24.333
<i>Takes a deep dive in the sea</i>

40:28.500 --> 40:32.750
<i>And I</i>
<i>I think I like you</i>

40:32.833 --> 40:35.791
<i>And I</i>

40:36.958 --> 40:43.583
<i>And I</i>
<i>I'm still trying to learn how to live</i>

40:45.208 --> 40:50.333
<i>And I</i>
<i>I don't wanna know</i>

40:50.416 --> 40:55.625
<i>About being someone</i>
<i>People want me to be</i>

40:57.250 --> 41:02.458
<i>People want me to be</i>

41:03.166 --> 41:05.250
<i>It was the pain</i>

41:05.333 --> 41:09.583
<i>Of the witch that made me cry</i>

41:09.666 --> 41:15.750
<i>Hoping that someday</i>
<i>I'd kiss someone by the sea</i>

41:19.875 --> 41:23.750
<i>You know that feeling of not knowing</i>
<i>if you're sleeping or awake?</i>

41:24.416 --> 41:27.166
<i>I feel I've spent my whole life sleeping.</i>

41:27.708 --> 41:29.333
I think that, deep down,

41:29.833 --> 41:31.958
it's because I've always been alone.

41:33.041 --> 41:34.208
And now I'm here,

41:35.333 --> 41:39.125
surrounded by people
who can help me see my best version.

41:39.208 --> 41:41.833
Maresia, I wanted to talk to you.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.750
Yesterday, I didn't accept the room

41:45.291 --> 41:47.500
because we don't know each other yet.

41:48.125 --> 41:52.833
But I learned that
when you don't know someone,

41:53.458 --> 41:55.166
you need to know them better.

41:55.833 --> 41:57.500
<i>That's why I was wrong.</i>

41:57.583 --> 41:59.958
<i>It's not every man for himself.</i>

42:00.041 --> 42:01.416
<i>Nobody can live alone.</i>

42:02.208 --> 42:04.750
<i>That's why we shouldn't talk for a while.</i>

42:06.250 --> 42:09.416
<i>At least until I can be that person.</i>

42:11.583 --> 42:12.625
I love you, Mom.

42:13.125 --> 42:16.958
<i>It was the pain</i>

42:18.541 --> 42:21.375
<i>That made me cry</i>

42:38.916 --> 42:40.250
Here we go!

42:41.041 --> 42:42.916
If you don't dance, tend to the kids.

42:58.458 --> 42:59.833
I read the brochure.

43:00.333 --> 43:02.750
-About the DNA.
-Oh yeah? So?

43:02.833 --> 43:03.833
I'm not doing it.

43:03.916 --> 43:07.083
I don't need a DNA test
to know Yasmin is my daughter.

43:08.125 --> 43:09.000
Conrado.

43:09.958 --> 43:12.041
I was thinking.

43:12.833 --> 43:15.000
I'm telling Yasmin about you, okay?

43:15.083 --> 43:16.083
She's coming!

43:17.166 --> 43:18.041
Miguel!

43:19.125 --> 43:21.416
-I saw you guys.
-What?

43:21.500 --> 43:24.333
You were dancing
and talking with Miguel. Cute.

43:25.583 --> 43:26.500
I know!

43:27.625 --> 43:29.541
I'll ask if he's dating someone.

43:30.166 --> 43:31.500
Yasmin!

43:31.583 --> 43:32.541
Are you single?

43:37.166 --> 43:38.750
Why are you asking me this?

43:38.833 --> 43:40.041
Everybody now!

43:42.666 --> 43:44.375
Let's do the circle, guys.

43:49.208 --> 43:50.833
One step at a time!

43:54.291 --> 43:55.208
Beautiful!

43:55.833 --> 43:58.208
Where's the bracelet I gave you?
Is it broken?

43:59.416 --> 44:01.500
What about your face? Is it broken?

44:03.833 --> 44:08.375
When did we start hurting each other
instead of making each other laugh?

44:17.666 --> 44:19.666
Thanks for not telling on me.

44:20.750 --> 44:22.291
Thanks for not telling on me too.

44:25.291 --> 44:29.291
If you want, I can help you
with your consumerism issue.

44:29.375 --> 44:30.500
Move away!

44:30.583 --> 44:31.416
I'd love to.

44:39.166 --> 44:42.500
I was thinking about what you said.

44:42.583 --> 44:45.083
What if we go
on a father-daughter tour tomorrow?

44:45.166 --> 44:47.458
-Sure. Where?
-The sea.

44:47.958 --> 44:49.625
To see the right whales.

44:57.666 --> 44:59.083
Have you heard the news?

45:01.041 --> 45:03.208
I saw your boyfriend kissing Catarina.
