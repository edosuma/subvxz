WEBVTT

00:03.586 --> 00:06.588
And now, please welcome
your valedictorian, Alex Dunphy.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.051
##  

00:15.432 --> 00:17.923
Where are my mom and dad?

00:20.771 --> 00:23.440
And in this corner,
finishing first in her class...

00:23.524 --> 00:26.690
delivering the commencement address,
weighing in at...

00:26.777 --> 00:28.437
- What do you weigh, honey?
- Dad!

00:28.529 --> 00:31.613
A healthy amount for a girl her age...

00:31.698 --> 00:33.572
- Are you gettin' all this, buddy?
- Pure gold.

00:33.659 --> 00:36.031
She's the main brain,
the cerebellum of the ball...

00:36.119 --> 00:38.990
Alex Dunphy!

00:39.081 --> 00:42.165
Oh, keep rolling. The news will want this
footage when I eventually snap.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.124
I thought Sanjay Patel
was first in the class.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.670
He was until he missed a few weeks...

00:45.754 --> 00:47.296
and the robot
he was building attacked him.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.501
It's happening, people.
Our hubris will be our undoing.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.344
Sweetie, what do you say
you and I go and get our nails done, huh?

00:53.428 --> 00:56.098
- It's okay. I wanna work on my speech.
 Been there.

00:56.181 --> 01:00.179
I remember the speech that won me
treasurer of my high school Spanish club.

01:00.269 --> 01:03.388
<i>Mi nombre es Felipe.</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:05.473
<i>Yo voy a la escuela...</i>

01:05.566 --> 01:07.024
Felipe?

01:07.109 --> 01:08.603
It was kind of a <i>grande</i> deal.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.603
I was up against an actual Puerto Rican.

01:10.696 --> 01:12.523
Honey, are you sure?

01:12.614 --> 01:14.441
Because I think
they can do school colors.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.241
- I'm good, Mom.
- Okay.

01:16.326 --> 01:20.276
<i>  Family milestones</i>
<i>always throw Claire for a loop.</i>

01:20.372 --> 01:22.163
She holds it in, and then the next day...

01:22.249 --> 01:25.285
she has a total meltdown
and I have to pick up the pieces.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.037
The problem is...

01:27.129 --> 01:29.371
tomorrow I'm supposed to go
to Vegas with my buds...

01:29.464 --> 01:33.083
so I need her to melt down today.

01:33.177 --> 01:37.257
Otherwise, what happens in Vegas won't
happen to me, because I won't be there.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.091
Emotional day, huh?

01:39.183 --> 01:41.341
Happy day.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.186
- Happy and sad.
- Hmm.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.607
<i>"Guys, I can't go to Vegas...</i>

01:47.691 --> 01:49.767
because my wife's freaking out."

01:49.860 --> 01:51.899
Trust me, that is not
a phone call you wanna make...

01:51.987 --> 01:54.822
to a bunch of ex-college
male cheerleaders.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.110
They will mock you
with a hurtful rhythmic taunt.

02:03.999 --> 02:04.995
Hello?

02:05.083 --> 02:07.206
- Gloria, it's me.
- Hi. How was the doctor?

02:07.294 --> 02:09.583
Can you pick up some bread
on the way home, please?

02:09.670 --> 02:12.625
I'm home. My damn gate remote
won't work. Could you press...

02:12.716 --> 02:14.210
- <i>  Hello?</i>
...nine?

02:14.301 --> 02:16.009
- Manny, it's okay.
- <i>What's okay?</i>

02:16.094 --> 02:19.510
- What's wrong? Where are you calling from?
- <i>I'm not calling from.</i>

02:19.598 --> 02:21.923
- Jay is calling.
- What's wrong with Jay?

02:22.017 --> 02:24.175
- My clicker won't work.
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

02:24.269 --> 02:27.021
Your heart's not working? How could
you tell us this over the phone?

02:27.105 --> 02:28.600
<i>My heart is fine.</i>

02:28.690 --> 02:31.442
Would somebody please press nine
and let me in?

02:31.527 --> 02:33.649
- Okay.
- Got it.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.895
It won't work
if you're both on the line.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.234
- Okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

02:39.117 --> 02:41.691
Every damn time!

02:44.289 --> 02:46.448
Okay, Lily, time to get dressed.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.914
I can't believe Alex
is gonna be in high school.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.042
- I feel so old.
- You feel old?

02:51.129 --> 02:54.296
I was there when she was born...
in the delivery room.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.375
- If I wasn't gay before...
- Oh, please.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.128
You wouldn't have lasted
two minutes on a farm.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.426
I've witnessed all kinds of birthing.
Never batted an eye.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.803
I've seen cattle.
I've seen hogs. I've seen goats.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.931
I've even seen the three-legged...
Oh! Whoa!

03:05.018 --> 03:07.556
Oh, my God.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.433
Oh, my God.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.433
- I'm sorry.
- Really, Mitchell?

03:12.526 --> 03:13.901
I could have just died.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.401
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

03:21.493 --> 03:23.616
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

03:23.704 --> 03:25.743
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

03:25.831 --> 03:27.622
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

03:27.708 --> 03:29.036
<i># Hey ##.</i>

03:31.753 --> 03:34.957
Principal Kaizler, faculty,
parents, fellow graduates...

03:35.048 --> 03:36.958
Hey, superstar.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.339
- Oh, you're working on your speech.
- Yep.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.005
Do you need any help?

03:41.096 --> 03:44.014
Sometimes it's great to bounce ideas
off someone whose opinion you value.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.843
- I'm good.
- Okay.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.769
That's cool I could do your hair.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.012
We could do it like we saw
in that magazine on...

03:51.106 --> 03:53.063
What's that actress?
What's her name? With the teeth?

03:53.150 --> 03:55.356
Mom, Mom, please.
I'm trying to concentrate.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.816
Okay. Okay.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.862
You be ready to go in a half hour...

03:59.948 --> 04:01.692
'cause we are gonna carpool
with your grandpa.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.453
Haley's driving me.
I wanna get there early.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.996
That's a great idea.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.872
Great. I will see you there...

04:08.957 --> 04:10.451
superstar.

04:12.002 --> 04:15.916
- Hey, Mama Bear. You okay?
- Not with "Mama Bear" I'm not.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.548
- Don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.459
Shh! Don't be brave.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.459
I'm here for you...

04:21.553 --> 04:25.503
...until 2:00 p.m. tomorrow,
when my flight leaves for Vegas.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.973
Where were you?
Did you bring the bread?

04:29.061 --> 04:31.896
I was stuck outside that gate
for 10 minutes before it opened.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.388
- So no bread?
- We gotta get that thing fixed.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.974
- <i>Ay,</i> what happened to your eye?
- What are you talking about?

04:37.069 --> 04:39.108
- It's droopy.
- What do you mean, droopy?

04:39.196 --> 04:42.612
Uh! I don't like the look of that, Jay.
Here. Let me check something.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.775
Put that thing away.
I saw my dermatologist.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.528
He was checking for moles or something.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.659
He probably got some
numbing cream on it. It's fine.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.201
Nothin' to worry about.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.452
I got Botox.

04:54.545 --> 04:58.127
Stupid doctor talked me into it,
and now it's drifting.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.788
I haven't felt this dumb
since I shelled out 30 bucks...

05:00.884 --> 05:03.755
for that bracelet,
supposed to give me better balance.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.589
- Try to push my arm down.
- Okay.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.424
- Go ahead. You can't do it.
- Okay. All right.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.517
Honey, I'm home!
Hey, why is your dad's car here?

05:14.815 --> 05:17.520
It's ironic that I stand up here
representing my classmates...

05:17.609 --> 05:19.353
when, for the past three years...

05:19.444 --> 05:21.935
most of them have treated me
like I'm invisible.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.565
It's my own fault. I was obsessed
with good grades instead of looks...

05:25.659 --> 05:27.616
popularity and skinny jeans.

05:27.703 --> 05:29.612
- What? Is that your speech?
- Get out of here!

05:29.705 --> 05:31.496
You cannot say that!

05:31.582 --> 05:34.369
Yes, I can. And you wanna know why?
'Cause it's the truth.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.626
No one wants to hear the truth.
It's very simple, Alex.

05:37.713 --> 05:41.129
In order to give a good speech, all you
have to do is take a song and say it...

05:41.216 --> 05:44.632
like "Don't Stop Believing,"
or "Get this Party Started."

05:44.720 --> 05:46.178
That's means nothing.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.884
Who cares? Nobody wants to think.

05:48.974 --> 05:52.010
It's a graduation...
a celebration of being done with thinking.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.810
People want to be challenged.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.639
They're gonna respect me for it.

05:55.731 --> 05:58.186
No one's ever gonna talk to you again.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.817
So what?

05:59.902 --> 06:03.152
Mahatma Gandhi went on a hunger strike
for what he believed in.

06:03.238 --> 06:06.856
That's 'cause no one
would eat with him in the cafeteria.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.863
Hmm.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.414
- Hey.
 Hey, guys.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.328
Come on over.
Have some lemonade and cookies.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.496
- Jay, that's not looking very good.
- It's fine.

06:20.589 --> 06:21.964
Quick. Who's the president.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.172
- Obama!
- Phil, please.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.501
- I'm trying to rule out a stroke.
- It's not a stroke.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.967
Why does everybody always assume
I'm having a stroke?

06:29.056 --> 06:30.218
 Age.
- Diet.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.098
You forgot to bring my bread.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.512
- I'm sorry we're late.
 It's okay.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.476
We gotta leave
in about five minutes though.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.433
Luke, stop pushing that ball around.
You're gonna fall in.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.931
Oh, yes, and then your Uncle Mitchell
will laugh at your expense.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.647
- I'm just saying. It's a character flaw.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.196
Okay, quick poll here.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.736
This morning, Cam... fully dressed...

06:47.824 --> 06:49.367
Thank God it's one of those stories.

06:49.451 --> 06:52.025
 ... while in the middle
of a very serious thought...

06:52.120 --> 06:53.912
fell into a ducky pool.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.453
Oh, my goodness. Are you all right?

06:56.542 --> 07:00.539
Yes, I am. Thank you. That is
a normal reaction... Love and concern.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.123
Okay, wait, wait.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.586
The pool popped.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.342
<i>Ay,</i> poor thing.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.753
- There's nothing worse than a tailbone injury.
- Seriously?

07:09.847 --> 07:12.219
No, no, no. You're so full of it.
You know this is funny.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.715
Picture this...

07:14.810 --> 07:17.217
falling into a tiny pool.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.272
He'll be here all week, folks...

07:20.357 --> 07:21.982
literally, because
you're not coming home with me.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.475
- There she is. There's my little Stella.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.443
That's my girl. Hi, sweetie.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.439
You're so cute
I just want to eat your face!

07:28.532 --> 07:30.026
- Aww.
- Mmm.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.406
You remember when
you used to hold Alex like that...

07:32.494 --> 07:34.368
- and you wanted to eat her face?
- Yeah.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.246
- Now she's off to high school.
- Mmm.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.371
- Time marches on, huh?
- Yep.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.202
- You know what's really sad?
- What?

07:40.294 --> 07:42.500
The end of <i>Titanic.</i>

07:42.588 --> 07:44.082
Hey, Luke.

07:44.173 --> 07:47.339
Do you realize in two years
you and I will be graduating?

07:47.426 --> 07:48.920
Not now.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.299
I think I'm moving the ball with my mind.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.594
Well, I'll be graduating.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.842
Hey, you know, you guys,
stop congratulating yourselves...

07:56.935 --> 07:58.762
for being <i>so</i> compassionate.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.475
If you had been there, you would have
laughed just as hard as I did.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.352
He's coming. Stop talking.
He's been embarrassed enough today.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.606
 Stop.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.951
Wow. Now it makes sense.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.699
It's a Pritchett thing.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.871
Cruelty's genetic.
Suddenly it's all very clear.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.452
Be careful. You might run into it.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.759
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Cam. I'm sorry.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.800
- Oh, my God. Dad, your face.
- What?

08:31.887 --> 08:33.760
Oh, that's nothing. Nothing. It's boring.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.639
I went to the dermatologist.
It's a boring story.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.681
No, no, no.
We gotta get you to a hospital.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.595
- I'm fine.
- Yes. I'm taking you. Come.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.644
- <i>¡ Vamos!</i>
- Wait. Wait right here.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.639
Gloria. Gloria!

08:45.734 --> 08:47.109
Gloria.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.605
Gloria. Gloria, hold on.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.365
The reason my face looks like this
is because I had...

08:51.448 --> 08:53.108
Botox.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.407
Like the ladies use for their wrinkles?

08:56.495 --> 08:59.033
Actually, nearly 10% of their sales
are men, but that's not important.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.660
I had a bad reaction...
Hit a nerve or something.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.375
It's gonna go away soon.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.081
- Hmm.
- What? What's that supposed to mean?

09:07.256 --> 09:08.750
- Nothing.
- Would you stop?

09:08.841 --> 09:11.166
This is very embarrassing for me.

09:12.261 --> 09:13.921
For both of us.

09:17.933 --> 09:20.768
He's fine. It was a false alarm.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.975
What do you mean, a false alarm?
His face looks like a candle.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.723
You heard her. I'm okay.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.021
- She's not a doctor.
- Neither are you.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.568
- Technically.
- Okay, look.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.775
I don't know what's going on here,
but there is no way...

09:30.863 --> 09:32.440
that <i>this</i> is normal.

09:32.531 --> 09:35.401
You look like a Botox job
gone horribly wrong.

09:35.492 --> 09:38.529
No, my God... You didn't.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.158
Of course he didn't.
  Did you?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.494
- No.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.455
- You did!
- What were you thinking? You're a veteran.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.420
Enough! This conversation is ended.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.831
Let's go.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.962
Do you think he got his butt done too?
It looks fantastic.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.760
Alex, wait. I'm sorry.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.926
If you wanna give your speech, go ahead.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.846
I was never valedictorian.
What do I know?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.218
Thank you!

10:05.314 --> 10:06.974
I am doing this for a reason.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.608
- It's not just like I'm...
- Aha!

10:08.692 --> 10:11.978
Sorry, Alex,
but you will thank me one day.

10:12.070 --> 10:15.689
Please. You really think
I don't have duplicates?

10:15.782 --> 10:17.905
If you do this you'll be a social piranha.

10:17.993 --> 10:21.991
Yes. I'll be an Amazonian
carnivorous fish.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.912
Carniv... What?

10:26.000 --> 10:32.074

10:33.383 --> 10:36.135
- Dad, open the gate.
- Aw, geez. Not now!

10:36.220 --> 10:37.595
What? What's happening?

10:37.679 --> 10:39.257
It's stuck again.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.506
What do you mean it's stuck?
Can't you get it open?

10:41.600 --> 10:43.391
What do you think "stuck" means, Claire?

10:43.477 --> 10:46.976
We have to do something, Dad.
Can't you push it open or something?

10:47.064 --> 10:50.349
- I don't know.
- We are trapped in your driveway...

10:50.442 --> 10:52.102
and you don't know?

10:52.194 --> 10:54.815
As a gate owner, Dad,
you have a certain responsibility.

10:54.905 --> 10:59.033
See, my daughter is gonna get up
on that stage and give a speech...

10:59.117 --> 11:01.953
and graduate from middle school, and
if I am not there I am going to freak out.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.745
- I am going to freak out!
 Let me push it.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.953
Do you have any idea how important it is...

11:06.041 --> 11:08.330
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm not. I'm not smiling.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.292
Do you not understand me?

11:10.379 --> 11:15.586
Chu-chunk. Hysterical wife,
hysterical wife, hysterical wife...

11:16.677 --> 11:18.171
Jackpot.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.799
- Oh, God. Come on!

11:24.893 --> 11:26.518
All right. Okay. We have tried this way.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.643
I say we ram the gate.
Kids, get out of the way.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.806
Hold on. I think I can fix this.

11:30.899 --> 11:34.849
- I just need a paper clip, some olive oil and a ribbon.
- What's the plan, "MacGayver"?

11:34.945 --> 11:37.697
Actually, the paper clip
is to connect these two circuits...

11:37.781 --> 11:39.774
and the olive oil is
to lubricate the mechanism.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.737
And the hair ribbon is for Lily.
Her hair's been driving me crazy all day.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.488
Why don't we just call some cabs?

11:44.580 --> 11:47.035
Because, Mitchell, this is not
Times Square and they'll take forever.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.662
- We'll just climb over the fence and start running.
- No, we won't...

11:49.751 --> 11:52.159
because it's five miles away, Phil,
and I'm in big shoes.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.748
So no.

11:53.839 --> 11:56.709
Wait, wait, wait! I save the day.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.125
Let's take this crazy bicycle.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.761
We throw it over the gate...

12:00.846 --> 12:02.673
then we take Phil and we take Claire...

12:02.764 --> 12:05.255
and then we throw them over the gate too.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.343
- What the hell is that?
- Jay bought it.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.263
He thought we were gonna
use it all the time...

12:09.354 --> 12:12.272
- but I keep hitting my boobs with my knees.
- Champagne problems, right?

12:12.357 --> 12:14.397
Honey, they're not gonna ride the bike.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.189
Yeah, but I still think
that we should throw it over the gate.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.903
Okay. You know what?
Thank you. Thank you.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.946
Nobody else has come up with an idea.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.776
I think I've got a good idea.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.991
We don't have time
to build a rocket, buddy.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.786
Never mind.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.873
Okay. So Phil and I will go over first...

12:29.958 --> 12:32.628
- and then you guys will throw over the bike.
- Step up. I'll boost you.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.336
- Couldn't we get a ladder?
- Please.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.292
On cheer squad I boosted girls bigger
than you to the top of a human pyramid.

12:37.382 --> 12:38.925
Now, arms at your side.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.966
Straight like a pencil.

12:41.053 --> 12:42.547
One, two...

12:42.638 --> 12:45.211
- # We are Bulldogs #
- Aaah!

12:45.307 --> 12:46.801
Ow!

12:47.643 --> 12:49.434
She's fine. Okay.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.311
Jay, now you do me.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.231
Just grab a handful. Don't be shy.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.977
I'm not giving you as much to work with.

12:57.069 --> 12:58.896
I used to have a lot more there.
I lost it.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.897
They used to call me the Grand Can.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.779
It's ironic that I stand up here...

13:08.872 --> 13:11.410
representing my classmates
when, for the past...

13:11.500 --> 13:14.038
- I read the rest of your speech.
- Congratulations.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.412
- Do you hate me?
- What?

13:17.506 --> 13:20.044
You talk about how all the popular kids
are shallow and lame.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.838
- I didn't mean you.
- You think you have everyone figured out...

13:22.928 --> 13:24.885
but everybody has their stuff.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.845
What <i>stuff</i> do you have?

13:26.932 --> 13:29.803
Too many boys chasing after you?
Too many parties?

13:29.893 --> 13:33.309
- You really wanna know what stuff I have?
- Yeah.

13:33.397 --> 13:36.932
I'm flunking out of Biology,
and now I have to go to summer school.

13:37.025 --> 13:40.774
My friends, all they can ever talk about
nowadays is going off to college...

13:40.863 --> 13:42.985
and I don't even know
if I can get into college.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.733
Is that enough stuff for you?

13:44.825 --> 13:47.363
- Whatever.
- You know what?

13:47.452 --> 13:50.157
Fine. Give your stupid speech.
Be an outcast.

13:50.247 --> 13:53.367
But you're only doing it to yourself,
because you're smart and pretty...

13:53.458 --> 13:55.617
and sort of funny
in a way that I don't really get...

13:55.711 --> 13:57.371
but other people seem to enjoy.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.538
So you can either start fresh next year...

13:59.631 --> 14:02.502
or be the freak who flipped off her class.

14:02.593 --> 14:03.873
You really think I'm pretty?

14:03.969 --> 14:05.511
Shut up!

14:11.226 --> 14:12.886
- Phil, go straight!
- This way's faster.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.472
- No, straight.
- Stop leaning!

14:14.563 --> 14:16.022
- Do you wanna drive?
- I do.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.265
Tough. I called it.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.473
- What was that?

14:19.568 --> 14:21.607
Oh, crap. The chain broke.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.189
Just keep pedaling. It doesn't matter.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.071
It matters a little.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.149
Cam, please be careful.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.199
Why? If I get electrocuted
my hat might blow off...

14:29.286 --> 14:30.994
and that would be funny as hell, right?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.787
No. No.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.165
Hey, Jay!

14:36.251 --> 14:37.793
I know you're feeling self-conscious...

14:37.878 --> 14:41.163
- so I dug up something I thought might help.
- Put that thing away.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.213
I knew you'd say that, but hear me out.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.835
This was designed to make a
hideously disfigured man look super cool.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.336
It's perfect for you. Ooh, yikes.

14:49.431 --> 14:52.432
Okay, I'll go upstairs
and see if I have a lefty.

14:55.771 --> 14:57.645
Don't look at me like that.

14:57.731 --> 15:01.776
I have to say that I am a little
disappointed in you doing this thing.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.019
Not me. I feel real good about it.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.737
How many times do I have to tell you...

15:05.822 --> 15:08.693
- that you don't have to look young for me?
- I didn't do it for you.

15:08.784 --> 15:10.823
- What is her name?
- Stop.

15:10.911 --> 15:14.576
Most of the time I walk around,
in my head, I'm 40.

15:14.665 --> 15:16.289
And I look in the mirror...

15:16.375 --> 15:19.292
I say, "Who's that old man?
What's he doing in my bathroom?"

15:19.378 --> 15:23.506
Well, it's my bathroom too,
and I like when the old guy is there.

15:23.590 --> 15:27.125
This is the face that I fell in love with.

15:27.219 --> 15:28.927
Not this face...

15:29.012 --> 15:30.637
- this one.
 Oh. Ooh!

15:30.722 --> 15:32.549
- The gate's opening. The gate's opening!
- How did you do that?

15:32.641 --> 15:34.301
- I didn't do anything.
- I did it.

15:34.393 --> 15:36.551
I opened it with my mind.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.056
Come on, guys.
Let's go, guys. Saddle up!

15:38.146 --> 15:39.605
- <i>¡ Vamos!</i>
 I'll get the car seat.

15:39.690 --> 15:42.477
Get Manny. Get Manny.
Everyone in the car. Let's go!

15:42.609 --> 15:42.651
Yep, that's what I thought.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.394
Yep, that's what I thought.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.194
Chain's broken.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.319
What do you think?

15:48.407 --> 15:50.649
I think we gotta go.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.743
Sweetie, we can't make it on foot.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.240
We have to try.

15:56.290 --> 15:57.867
Honey.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.832
Honey! It's okay.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.290
It's not okay, Phil. It's not okay.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.122
We're losing her.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.590
- Alex?
- Yes.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.247
- You're not losing her.
- Oh, we are. She's going to high school.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.217
This is just when I lost Haley.

16:10.304 --> 16:12.925
This is when Haley went
from being my sweet little angel...

16:13.015 --> 16:18.720
to being a moody, texting,
snotty little princess who hates me.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.556
Haley doesn't hate you.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.355
And we're not losing her.

16:22.441 --> 16:24.599
Do you remember when
you used to come home from work...

16:24.693 --> 16:27.528
and Haley would meet you at the door
in her little <i>Aladdin</i> pajamas?

16:27.613 --> 16:29.985
You know, and she'd stick
her arms up in the air and say...

16:30.073 --> 16:32.695
"Daddy, Daddy, take me
on a magic carpet ride."

16:32.784 --> 16:34.409
Remember that?

16:34.494 --> 16:37.579
When was the last time
Haley was that excited to see you?

16:39.333 --> 16:42.287
- I don't remember. It's been so long.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.619
We're losing another one.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.797
That's what kids do. They leave.
They leave and they...

16:47.883 --> 16:49.840
and they don't come back.

16:49.927 --> 16:53.130
- Oh, well, ours will come back. Right?
- What if they don't...

16:53.222 --> 16:56.222
and pretty soon it's just the two of us?

16:57.434 --> 16:59.806
- I don't wanna go to Vegas anymore.
- I know.

16:59.895 --> 17:02.730
I just wanna hug 'em and embarrass 'em
in front of their friends.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.473
I know.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.440
And Alex... My God.

17:06.527 --> 17:08.186
If we miss this speech...

17:08.278 --> 17:12.857
Honey, she's a middle child.
She will never forgive us.

17:13.784 --> 17:15.492
I'm not missing that speech!

17:15.577 --> 17:17.784
- Hello! Hello!
- What's the plan, Phil?

17:17.871 --> 17:20.160
<i>Mi nombre es Felipe.</i>

17:20.249 --> 17:22.574
<i>Yo voy a la escuela.</i>

17:22.667 --> 17:24.493
- You need a ride to the school?
- Yes, please.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.079
"Felipe"?

17:31.385 --> 17:34.090
 Okay.
- <i>¡ Vámonos, muchachos!</i>

17:34.179 --> 17:37.429
<i>##  </i>

17:39.017 --> 17:41.769
I am so proud to be standing in front...

17:41.854 --> 17:43.727
of this extraordinary
group of youngsters...

17:43.814 --> 17:47.147
I'm sorry. Or should I say "oldsters"?

17:47.234 --> 17:49.725
But seriously, the word
"commencement"...

17:49.820 --> 17:51.528
means "beginning."

17:51.613 --> 17:54.104
- I'm sorry I laughed.
- I don't need an apology...

17:54.199 --> 17:57.153
but I will say your behavior today
has been very eye-opening.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.952
- No offense, Jay.
- None taken.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.279
You look like an iceberg.

18:02.958 --> 18:06.541
Okay. Senor, this is it, right here. Yeah.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.792
- Okay.
- <i>Muchas gracias, muchachos.</i>

18:11.884 --> 18:13.793
You're quite welcome.

18:15.137 --> 18:19.431
And now please welcome
your valedictorian, Alex Dunphy.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.307
 Where's my mom and dad?
- Thank you.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.392
Hmm... There they are.

18:33.405 --> 18:34.983
Principal Kaizler...

18:35.073 --> 18:36.817
- faculty...
- Phil!

18:36.909 --> 18:38.818
- School board administrators...

18:38.911 --> 18:40.239
fellow graduates...

18:40.329 --> 18:42.286
- I got you.
- Parents...

18:42.372 --> 18:44.412
- everyone who helped us through this challenging...

18:44.499 --> 18:46.741
Cam, you have lost all credibility.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.495
- It's completely different.
- How?

18:48.587 --> 18:50.414
  It's the juxtaposition
of absurdist comedy...

18:50.506 --> 18:52.831
against the backdrop of a formal setting.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.668
Not a big-boned man falling into a pool.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.167
- Really?
- Shh! This is about Alex.

18:57.262 --> 19:01.675
It's ironic that I stand up here
representing my classmates...

19:01.767 --> 19:03.261
when...

19:06.146 --> 19:08.898
they're so awesome.

19:08.982 --> 19:12.019
They should be up here themselves.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.605
But I'm up here...

19:13.695 --> 19:18.192
and... I'm sayin'... stuff...

19:18.283 --> 19:21.533
'cause... everybody's got their...

19:21.620 --> 19:23.577
stuff...

19:23.664 --> 19:25.573
whether you're popular...

19:25.666 --> 19:27.623
or a drama geek...

19:27.709 --> 19:29.204
- Oh.
- Or a cheerleader...

19:29.294 --> 19:31.038
or...

19:31.129 --> 19:32.588
even a nerd like me.

19:32.673 --> 19:35.627
- We all have our insecurities.

19:35.717 --> 19:36.915
- Yes, we do.
- Shh.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.718
We're all just trying
to figure out who we are.

19:40.556 --> 19:42.216
