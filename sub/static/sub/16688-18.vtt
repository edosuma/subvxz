00:10.040 --> 00:12.160
( Rigby snoring )

00:13.640 --> 00:15.060
Rigby!
( Screams )

00:15.160 --> 00:17.660
We're rocketing through space
at warp speed,

00:17.760 --> 00:19.740
and you're asleep
at the controls?!

00:19.840 --> 00:21.100
It's on autopilot!

00:21.200 --> 00:23.200
That means I don't
have to push any buttons!

00:23.040 --> 00:25.320
And, believe me, I tried to push
a <i>lotof different buttons.</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:27.500
Eileen, how close are we
to the rendezvous point?

00:27.600 --> 00:30.740
We should be coming out
of warp right about...

00:30.840 --> 00:32.840
( Beep )
Now!

00:34.720 --> 00:36.380
It's just
empty space.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.180
Maybe Buttons McGee
over here

00:38.280 --> 00:40.380
sent us
to the wrong coordinates.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.620
Wow, Skips, that's a really
insightful name for Rigby.

00:43.720 --> 00:44.700
Thanks.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.540
I been
reading some books.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.640
Wait, what's that?

00:49.480 --> 00:51.180
<i>Computer:</i>
<i>Alpha Dome found.</i>

00:51.280 --> 00:53.500
<i>Piloted by Mary Stone,</i>
<i>John Murrow...</i>

00:53.600 --> 00:54.740
Alpha Dome?

00:54.840 --> 00:56.460
It's the first dome
sent into space.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.580
Yeah, I know.
Then why were you asking?

00:58.680 --> 01:01.140
I wasn't asking.
I was just surprised.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.060
It sounded
like you were asking.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.140
I wasn't asking!

01:04.240 --> 01:06.060
<i>...Steve Mikulski.</i>

01:06.160 --> 01:08.180
<i>Dome status ââ unknown.</i>

01:08.280 --> 01:09.460
Hail them.

01:09.560 --> 01:10.740
Now hailing.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.840
( Ringing )

01:14.680 --> 01:16.680
They're not answering.
( Answering machine clicks )

01:16.600 --> 01:19.180
<i>Recorded voice: At the tone,</i>
<i>please record your message.</i>

01:19.280 --> 01:21.280
<i>( Beep )</i>
Hang up, hang up,
hang up!

01:20.560 --> 01:22.460
( Sighs ) Rawls' coordinates
brought us here.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.780
There must be something
important in that dome.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.100
Skips, take Mordecai and Rigby
and check it out.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.200
But be careful ââ
we gotta be on the lookout

01:28.880 --> 01:30.740
for anyone trying
to get to Pops.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.840
Starting
dome docking procedure.

01:38.000 --> 01:38.900
Careful!

01:39.000 --> 01:40.660
Whatever stopped the dome

01:40.760 --> 01:43.080
could be waiting
to stop <i>us,too.</i>

01:48.400 --> 01:50.300
( Rustling )
( Screams )

01:50.400 --> 01:52.100
( Whimpers )

01:52.200 --> 01:54.200
( Clucking )
All: Huh?!

01:55.760 --> 01:57.020
( All gasp )

01:57.120 --> 01:58.700
Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

01:58.800 --> 02:00.800
Skips: Interesting.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.420
Or "Whoa."
I don't know.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.700
( Gasps )

02:04.800 --> 02:05.700
Visitors!

02:05.800 --> 02:07.100
Visitors, everyone!

02:07.200 --> 02:09.500
( Excited chatter )

02:09.600 --> 02:11.780
I think
that's Captain Mary Stone.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.180
Good morrow,
gentlemen.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.980
We don't get
many visitors.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.300
From where
have you come?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.400
Oh, from that other dome
right there.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.220
Do you have something
for us

02:19.320 --> 02:21.620
or do you know why
our computer brought us here?

02:21.720 --> 02:22.900
Computer?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.820
Is that the name
of your horse?

02:24.920 --> 02:27.540
Oh, what a lovely name
for a horse!

02:27.640 --> 02:30.380
Eh...would you mind telling us
what year it is?

02:30.480 --> 02:33.460
Why, it's the year
of our Silas, 1690.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.900
All: 1690?!

02:35.000 --> 02:35.940
Huddle up, boys.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.100
Something's wrong here.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.100
These people are stuck
in the past.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.200
Why can't we just tell them
it's the future?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.540
The truth could send them
into total shock!

02:43.640 --> 02:46.380
But Rawls must have sent us
to Alpha Dome for <i>something.</i>

02:46.480 --> 02:47.740
Follow my lead.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.340
( Clears throat )
Excuse me, madam.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.440
Wouldst thou know
where to find

02:51.920 --> 02:53.940
the leader
of this good township?

02:54.040 --> 02:56.340
Why, you're speaking
of our town father,

02:56.440 --> 02:57.780
Silas the Wise.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.020
Praise Silas!

02:59.120 --> 03:00.940
Together:
Praise Silas!

03:01.040 --> 03:03.020
Somebody praising my name?

03:03.120 --> 03:04.500
Together: Silas!

03:04.600 --> 03:06.500
Heâeây!

03:06.600 --> 03:08.460
Did I carry you well,
Silas?

03:08.560 --> 03:11.500
What was that?
Did my carriage speaketh?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.780
I don't want to
have to get a <i>newcarriage!</i>

03:13.880 --> 03:16.020
No, Silas!
Your carriage spoke not!

03:16.120 --> 03:18.900
Your carriage shall carry you
until its wheels fall off

03:19.000 --> 03:21.500
from its crippling
calcium deposits.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.460
Good.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.560
Boy, feed the carriage.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.060
Ooh!
My buckle and hat!

03:28.160 --> 03:29.580
Who are these newcomers?

03:29.680 --> 03:32.100
They came here
on a horse named Computer.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.780
Computer?

03:33.880 --> 03:34.940
( Chuckling ) My!

03:35.040 --> 03:37.460
WâWhat a wonderful name
for a horse!

03:37.560 --> 03:40.380
Good sir, are you not
the Steve Mikulski

03:40.480 --> 03:42.140
from the crew photo?

03:42.240 --> 03:44.220
Pho...to?

03:44.320 --> 03:48.180
Ha! What a hilarious word,
with so many sounds!

03:48.280 --> 03:50.020
Mary, these people
are quite funny.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.260
Excellent discovery.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.180
Have some hay.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.540
Ugh! Couldst thou just take us
to your control room ââ

03:56.640 --> 03:58.220
Silas! Silas!

03:58.320 --> 04:01.380
Steffen has accidentally buckled
his shoe to his hat again!

04:01.480 --> 04:03.220
( Sighs )
These simple creatures.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.500
Silas' work is never done.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.600
While you're busy with this,
would you ââ

04:07.160 --> 04:09.820
or...thine ââ
mind if we take a look around?

04:09.920 --> 04:11.060
( Chuckles )
Of course not!

04:11.160 --> 04:13.140
Consider thyselves
the honored guests

04:13.240 --> 04:15.240
of Silas the Wise.

04:17.840 --> 04:18.980
Hmm.

04:32.360 --> 04:33.500
All: Whoa!

04:33.600 --> 04:35.260
Mordecai:
The Alpha Dome bridge!

04:35.360 --> 04:37.360
This place is a pigsty!

04:47.920 --> 04:49.620
Man, what is up
with this place?!

04:49.720 --> 04:52.120
That computer's gotta know
why were here.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.300
<i>This is Steve Mikulski,</i>

05:04.960 --> 05:07.820
( All gasp )
What's going on?!

05:07.920 --> 05:10.380
It's a time anomaly!
It's sucking us in!

05:10.480 --> 05:12.220
Redirect power
to stabilizers!

05:12.320 --> 05:14.380
Redirecting!

05:14.480 --> 05:16.500
Hold her steady, Steven.
( Exhales nervously )

05:16.600 --> 05:19.200
Calculating an 80% chance
of getting ripped apart.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.860
90%. 95%.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.180
I don't know
about you guys,

05:24.280 --> 05:26.620
but I'm ready to die

Steven?!

05:34.600 --> 05:37.580
<i>So...I heroically sprinted</i>

Good day to you!

What the...?!

06:22.920 --> 06:24.920
Benson, Alpha Dome
went through a time vortex,

06:24.680 --> 06:26.340
and the crew
regressed to Pilgrims.

06:26.440 --> 06:29.020
Ugh! How are we gonna get
the info we need from them?

06:29.120 --> 06:31.320
<i>We've got to figure out</i>
<i>a way to turn Alpha Dome</i>
<i>back to normal.</i>

06:31.400 --> 06:33.900
Can you guys send me the
coordinates of the time anomaly?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Uh, yeah.
Stand by.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.860
It's not far from here.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.960
If we push them the other way
through the vortex,

06:40.840 --> 06:42.840
it <i>shouldreverse</i>
the time effects

06:42.360 --> 06:44.360
and bring Alpha Dome
back to present day.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.700
Okay.
Eileen, plot the course.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.180
Muscle Man,
you've got the helm.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.180
You guys ââ
get out of Alpha Dome.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.060
Together: Right!
Not so fast!

06:51.160 --> 06:53.340
I've had enough
of your snooping around!

06:53.440 --> 06:55.780
Look, the jig is up,
<i>Steve.</i>

06:55.880 --> 06:57.660
No! Never!

06:57.760 --> 06:59.760

We'll find him.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.740
There's nowhere to hide.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.380
You won't
get away with this.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.420
I can do
whatever I want.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.460
Let's deal with them
the 1690s way.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.180
( Cheering )
Aw, yeah!

07:13.280 --> 07:15.340
Pilgrimâwitchâtrial
style!

07:15.440 --> 07:18.140
They are doubters
of the word of Silas.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.900
These outsiders dabble
in the suuuuupernatural!

07:22.000 --> 07:23.100
( All gasp )

07:23.200 --> 07:25.900
Look what I found
amongst their belongings!

07:26.000 --> 07:27.540
Dude!
Why'd you bring that?!

07:27.640 --> 07:29.420
I don't know.
I thought if we had downtime...

07:29.520 --> 07:34.380
By pressing this witch artifact,
this little man jumps!

07:34.480 --> 07:36.340
( All gasp )
Wait a minute.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.420
Wallace Marco here,
proprietor of the dirt farm.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.220
Quick question,
my Silas.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.100
Like, what makes
<i>thatwitchery evil</i>

07:44.200 --> 07:46.980
and the witchery
you use to rule us good?

07:47.080 --> 07:49.580
I mean,
it's confusing, right?

07:49.680 --> 07:51.420
Witch!
Wallace is a witch!

07:51.520 --> 07:53.820
No, I ââ
( All chanting "Witch!" )

07:53.920 --> 07:56.660

<i>Benson: Skips! Skips, come in!</i>

Where are we

08:00.520 --> 08:01.940
<i>Working on it!</i>

08:02.040 --> 08:04.040
Okay. We're gonna move the domes
into position.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.960
Begin maneuvers.
Eileen: Got it.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.180
( Yelling )
Now, with a flash
of my future laser,

08:10.280 --> 08:12.420
I signal the execution
of these ââ

( Screams )

08:13.560 --> 08:15.560
Wait, what?!

08:15.920 --> 08:18.180
My!
The heavens are shaking!

08:18.280 --> 08:19.620
These are witch tremors!

08:26.080 --> 08:28.080
Huh?!

08:28.800 --> 08:31.140
Quit trying
to laser my friends!

08:31.240 --> 08:33.600

08:35.080 --> 08:37.080
Both: Skips!

To the escape pod!

08:40.360 --> 08:42.360
( Growls )

08:44.200 --> 08:46.240
All right, when we get close
enough, we've got to break away.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.940
Careful ââ
If we don't do it just right,

08:48.040 --> 08:49.420
<i>we'llgo forward</i>
in time, too.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.080
I'm not ready
for my future yet.

Ha!

in my affairs!

09:00.000 --> 09:01.700
But joke's on you!

09:01.800 --> 09:03.460
If you push us back
through the vortex,

09:03.560 --> 09:05.620
I'll just get smarter!

09:05.720 --> 09:06.820
( Growls ) He's right!

09:06.920 --> 09:08.420
Wait, <i>ishe right?</i>

09:08.520 --> 09:11.420
Now, say hello to
the smartest man in the dome.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.580
And then say goodbye.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.120
( Laughing evilly )

09:18.040 --> 09:20.180
Hold.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.140
Hold.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.940
( Beeping )

09:23.040 --> 09:24.340
Point of no return
imminent!

09:24.440 --> 09:25.580
( Beeping quickens )

09:25.680 --> 09:27.680
Disengage!

09:29.840 --> 09:31.460
( Laughing evilly )

09:31.560 --> 09:32.420
( Growls )

09:32.520 --> 09:34.900
Aah!
No, no! Stop!

09:35.000 --> 09:38.160
( All screaming )

09:39.360 --> 09:41.360
( All coughing )

09:44.840 --> 09:45.580
No!

09:45.680 --> 09:46.940
No, no! Wait!

09:47.040 --> 09:49.040
I need to be out there!

09:49.960 --> 09:52.660
No! I'm too late!

09:52.760 --> 09:56.420
Together:
Steve, you've been a jerk.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.420
Mary?!
What happened to you?

09:58.520 --> 10:01.900
Due to vortical flux, we're now
superâadvanced energy beings

10:02.000 --> 10:04.660
from the year 3300 ââ
give or take.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.620
Thank you for putting Steve
in his place.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.700
We're gonna keep him as a pet
from the early 21st century.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.420
Here, eat this hay.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.660
( Gags )

10:12.760 --> 10:14.820
I'm glad things are
back to normal...ish.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.180
But we still don't know
why we were brought here.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.080
Oh! We were instructed by Rawls
to give you this map.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.140
Aw, man!
Another set of coordinates?

10:23.240 --> 10:25.520
Why didn't Rawls just give these
to us in the first place?

10:25.600 --> 10:27.740
We needed
to hide your path.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.920
( Both laughing )
