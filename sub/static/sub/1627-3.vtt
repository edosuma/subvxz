you’ve ever known...

An evil queen sent a bunch
of fairy tale characters here?

And now they don't remember
who they are.

00:16.392 --> 00:17.848
NARRATOR:
Victims of a powerful curse.

00:17.935 --> 00:18.924
Everything you love,

00:19.270 --> 00:21.010
everything all of you love,

00:21.105 --> 00:22.436
will be taken from you.

NARRATOR: Only one knows the truth,

00:24.609 --> 00:27.146

It's your destiny.

00:28.446 --> 00:29.526
You're gonna bring back
the happy endings.

01:19.372 --> 01:20.737
I've seen better.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.539
This is taking forever.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.829
I told you the Troll Road
would've been quicker.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.251
(RUMBLING)

01:27.672 --> 01:29.162
And far less bumpy.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.586
Are you even listening to me?

01:33.678 --> 01:34.838
Yes, of course I am.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.300
Now what?

01:49.568 --> 01:51.650
Worry not, it's but a fallen tree.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.190

02:07.336 --> 02:09.713
My Lord, what is it?

02:10.047 --> 02:11.082
Look at these markings.

02:12.216 --> 02:13.547
This tree didn't fall. It's been cut.

02:15.720 --> 02:16.960
It's an ambush.

You're a

03:07.104 --> 03:08.139
You can't hide from me!

03:09.648 --> 03:12.060
Wherever you are, I will find you!

03:23.871 --> 03:27.329
Where were we?
Something about you wanting 15 kids?

03:27.750 --> 03:28.956
Oh, good Lord, no.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.792
I meant in my class. Where I teach.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.868
You'll meet them tomorrow.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.545
They're coming to the hospital as part
of the volunteer outreach program.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.625
Oh, yeah, that is a great program.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.051
I mean, obviously
I don't want 15 kids of my own.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.800
I mean, not that I don't want kids, I do.

03:44.141 --> 03:47.053
I want kids, marriage, true love.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.135
I want it all.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.516
But that, of course, is

03:56.112 --> 03:58.478
wildly inappropriate for me
to discuss on a first date.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.145
Hmm?

04:01.033 --> 04:02.022
Ruby!

04:02.243 --> 04:03.528
Yes, Mary Margaret?

04:05.329 --> 04:06.830
Check, please.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.173
Hey.

04:28.727 --> 04:29.716
You okay?

04:30.354 --> 04:33.266
Oh, in the world of tight spots
I've been in,

04:33.357 --> 04:35.689
crashing in my car
doesn't even rank in the top 10.

04:35.985 --> 04:37.191
You're sleeping here?

04:37.611 --> 04:38.726
Till I find a place.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.357
You decided to stay.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.230
For Henry.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.195
Yeah, I guess.

04:46.704 --> 04:50.162
This town doesn't seem to have
many vacancies. None, actually.

04:50.833 --> 04:51.993
Is that normal?

04:52.877 --> 04:54.993

Why are you out so late?

04:57.339 --> 04:59.876
Well, I'm a teacher, not a nun.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.503
I had a date.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.168
From the looks of things, it went well.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.470
As well as they ever do.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.263
Tell me he at least paid.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.432
Mmm-mmm.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.217
Well,

05:13.522 --> 05:16.229
I guess if true love was easy,
we'd all have it.

05:18.235 --> 05:21.443
You know, if things get cramped,

05:22.531 --> 05:23.566
I do have a spare room.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.064
Thanks.

05:26.911 --> 05:29.243
I'm not really the roommate type.

05:29.914 --> 05:32.280
It's just not my thing.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.123
I do better on my own.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.339
Well, good night.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.503
Good luck with Henry.

05:40.591 --> 05:41.580
Yeah.

06:04.949 --> 06:08.191
Henry, we could really use your help
with the decorations.

06:08.452 --> 06:11.615
ls Mr. Doe going to be okay,
Miss Blanchard?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.036
His name is not John Doe, honey.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.500
That's just what they call people
when they don't know who they are.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.541
Do you know who he is?

06:18.796 --> 06:19.751
No.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.829
ljust bring him flowers on my rounds.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.084
What's wrong with him?

06:23.509 --> 06:24.544
I don't know.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.798
He's been like this
as long as I've been volunteering.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.262
Does he have any family or friends?

06:31.559 --> 06:32.969
No one's claimed him.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.514
So, he's all alone?

06:37.815 --> 06:38.804
Yeah.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.523
It's quite sad.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.188
You sure you don't know him?

06:48.158 --> 06:51.195
Of course I'm sure.
Come on. You shouldn't be in here.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.005
HENRY: I found your father.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.171
Prince Charming.

07:05.509 --> 07:06.749
Henry...

07:06.844 --> 07:09.301
He's in the hospital in a coma.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.758
See this scar?

07:11.849 --> 07:12.964
He has one, too.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.175
So? Lots of people have scars.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.931
In the same place.

07:18.022 --> 07:19.512
Don't you see what this means?

07:21.400 --> 07:24.267
The curse is keeping them apart
with the coma.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.023
Now they're stuck without each other.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.356
We have to tell Miss Blanchard
we found her Prince Charming.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.567
Okay, kid. Telling someone their

07:33.704 --> 07:36.787
soul mate is in a coma
is probably not helpful.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.707
Not having a happy ending
is painful enough,

07:40.711 --> 07:43.123
but giving someone unrealistic hope
is far worse.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.794
But what if I'm right?

07:44.882 --> 07:47.874
We know who they are,
now they have to know.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.467
And how do you intend
to make that happen?

07:50.554 --> 07:51.885
By reminding him.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.173
We have to get her
to read their story to John Doe.

07:55.267 --> 07:58.555
Then maybe he'll remember who he is.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.221
Okay.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.432
Okay?

08:04.526 --> 08:07.359
Yeah. We'll do it, but we'll do it my way.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.895
Let me ask her.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.575
You want me to read to a coma patient?

08:15.663 --> 08:19.030
Henry thinks it will help him
remember who he was.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.668
And who does he think he was?

08:21.752 --> 08:22.912
Prince Charming.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.123
And if I'm Snow White,

08:26.548 --> 08:30.166
he thinks me and him...

08:30.260 --> 08:33.718
He has a very active imagination.
Which is the point.

08:33.806 --> 08:36.798
I can't talk him out of his beliefs.
So we need to show him.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.467
Play along, do what he says,

08:39.561 --> 08:42.143
and then maybe, just maybe...

08:42.231 --> 08:44.938
He'll see that fairy tales are just that.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.061
That there's no such thing
as love at first sight.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.609
Or first kiss. He'll see reality.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.358
Something like that.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.277
Sadly, this plan is rather genius.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.079
We get him to the truth
without hurting him.

09:02.918 --> 09:07.036
I told him that we will all meet tomorrow
for breakfast at Granny's,

09:07.131 --> 09:08.746
and you will give a full report.

09:09.466 --> 09:13.129
Well, I suppose
I'll get ready for my date.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.719
I guess I'll have to do all the talking.

09:17.641 --> 09:22.635
Look, I know this is odd,
but I'm doing it for a friend.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.555

14:16.440 --> 14:18.772
It's a merger. And quite frankly,
it's none of your business.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.520
-Now this is what's going to happen.
-Mmm-hmm.

14:20.610 --> 14:21.941
I'm going to cut you down,

14:22.029 --> 14:24.270
and you will take me
to whoever has my jewels,

14:25.198 --> 14:26.654
and then you're going
to get my ring back.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.074
Mmm-mmm. Why would I do that?

14:31.788 --> 14:35.656
Because you don't want me
to tell anyone who you really are...

14:37.210 --> 14:38.791
(PAPER RUSTLING)

14:43.133 --> 14:44.168

14:46.678 --> 14:48.418
Help me get my ring back

14:48.805 --> 14:51.797
or I turn you over to the Queen's forces.

14:53.268 --> 14:57.932
And I have a feeling the Queen's
not as charming as I am.

15:02.486 --> 15:03.475
Well,

15:04.571 --> 15:07.028
I wouldn't want to stand in the way
of your getting true love.

15:11.620 --> 15:12.609
Ahhh!

15:16.291 --> 15:17.622
Thanks for the shirt.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.408
Hey, is this your mother's?

15:19.503 --> 15:20.913
She'll never notice.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.744
Where does she think you are anyway?

15:22.839 --> 15:23.999
Playing Whack-A-Mole.

15:24.633 --> 15:25.839
And she bought that?

15:26.176 --> 15:28.041
She wants to believe it. So she does.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.505
Oh, imagine that.

15:30.806 --> 15:31.966
(BELLS CHIMING)

15:32.057 --> 15:33.968
She's here!

15:34.476 --> 15:38.344
Hey, don't get your hopes up.
We're just getting started, okay?

15:42.901 --> 15:44.687
-He woke up.
-What?

15:44.778 --> 15:45.767
I knew it.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.602
I mean, he didn't wake up-wake up.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.107
But he grabbed my hand.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.188
He's remembering.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.272
What did the doctor say?

15:51.368 --> 15:54.531
That I imagined it.
But I'm not crazy, I know it happened.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.867
We have to go back.
You have to read to him again.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.210
Let's go.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.372
Wait. Wait... What?

16:03.463 --> 16:04.498
If I got through to him,

16:05.006 --> 16:06.132
if we made a connection...

16:06.216 --> 16:07.251
You don't believe...

16:07.342 --> 16:09.378
That he's Prince Charming?
Of course not.

16:09.553 --> 16:13.421
Somehow, someway, I touched him.

16:14.599 --> 16:17.466
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

16:17.978 --> 16:19.718
You're right! He's waking up.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.177
Henry, you should stay back.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.975
What's going on?

16:23.066 --> 16:24.852
Is it John Doe? Is he okay?

16:26.069 --> 16:28.105
He's missing.

16:43.253 --> 16:44.959
What the hell are you doing here?

16:45.714 --> 16:46.920
And you.

16:47.591 --> 16:50.173
I thought you were at the arcade.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.841
Now you're lying to me?

16:51.928 --> 16:54.840
What happened to John Doe?
Did someone take him?

16:54.931 --> 16:55.920
We don't know yet.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.598
His IVs were ripped out, but there's
no sign for sure there was a struggle.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.800
What did you do?

17:00.937 --> 17:02.518
You think I had something
to do with this?

17:02.606 --> 17:05.518
It is curious that the Mayor is here.

17:05.609 --> 17:08.271
I'm here because
I'm his emergency contact.

17:08.612 --> 17:09.692
You know him?

17:09.779 --> 17:13.738
I found him on the side of the road
years ago with no ID.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.106
I brought him here.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.317
Mayor Mills saved his life.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.446
Will he be okay?

17:17.537 --> 17:20.028
Okay? The man's been
on feeding tubes for years,

17:20.123 --> 17:21.203
under constant supervision.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.406
He needs to get back here right away

17:22.500 --> 17:25.628
or, quite honestly, "Okay"
might be a pipe dream.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.203
Well then let's quit yappin'
and start looking.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.504
That's what we're doing.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.547
Just stay out of this, dear.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.797
And since I clearly can't keep you
away from my son,

17:36.431 --> 17:39.514
I guess I'm just going to have to
keep my son away from you.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.141
Enjoy my shirt,

17:43.146 --> 17:45.137
because that's all you're getting.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.982
Sheriff, find John Doe.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.060
You heard Dr. Whale,

17:51.154 --> 17:52.519
time is precious.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.739
Doctor, how long between your rounds
since you last saw him?

18:00.830 --> 18:01.990
Twelve hours or so.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.992
Then that's what we need
to account for.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.749
You two were the only employees
on the floor last night.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.497
-And you saw nothing?
-(YAWNING)

18:08.588 --> 18:09.577
Not a thing.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.083
Did anyone walk by?

18:12.133 --> 18:13.213
I didn't see nothing.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.175
Miss Blanchard,
was there anything unusual you saw

18:16.263 --> 18:17.628
during your trip with your class?

18:17.722 --> 18:18.837
I don't think so.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.973
We're looking at the wrong tape.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.226
This is the ward where Henry's class
put up decorations.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.598
If this was really the tape
from last night,

18:26.690 --> 18:28.180
we'd see the banners the kids hung.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.560
(SCOFFS) You fell asleep again.

18:30.193 --> 18:31.273

18:31.361 --> 18:32.601
I ain't getting fired for this.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.106
Least I don't drink on the job!

18:34.197 --> 18:35.528

18:35.615 --> 18:37.321
Where's the real tape?

18:37.409 --> 18:38.945
(TAPE WHIRRING)

18:44.541 --> 18:46.202
(SIGHS) He walked out alone.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.032
He's okay.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.459
Four hours ago.

18:49.546 --> 18:50.535
Where does this door lead?

18:50.630 --> 18:51.619
The woods.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.405
I thought you weren't the jewelry type.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.070
What's that around your neck?

19:18.867 --> 19:20.323
Don't worry about it.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.114
Careful! It's a weapon.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.826
What, dust?
What kind of weapon is dust?

19:26.916 --> 19:27.996
Fairy dust.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.699
I thought that was a good thing.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.045
When it comes from a good fairy.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.120
This stuff is deadly.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.914
It transforms the most
fearsome of adversaries

19:36.009 --> 19:37.249
into a form that's easily squashed.

19:39.262 --> 19:40.593
Then why didn't you use it on me?

19:41.723 --> 19:42.929
'Cause you're not worth it.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.476
(CHUCKUNG)

19:51.399 --> 19:52.775
Ah! The Queen.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.143
Got a lot of anger there,
don't you, Snow?

19:58.114 --> 20:00.105
The charges on her posters are lies.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.784
Didn't stop her from sending
her huntsman to rip out my heart.

20:05.789 --> 20:06.744
What happened?

20:06.831 --> 20:09.493
Well, not everyone is a soulless royal.

He took pity on me and let me go.

to leave this place.

Somewhere isolated.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.133
Where I can never be hurt.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.472
Sounds lonely.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.554
No lonelier than an arranged marriage.

At least I don't prey on the innocent.

I've only ever stolen from the Queen.

is what it takes to survive.

to incur that much wrath?

from a similar situation to his own.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.600
I want to buy back the jewels I sold you.

28:11.691 --> 28:12.680
Who is he?

28:12.775 --> 28:14.766
I said don't worry about it.

28:16.070 --> 28:18.652
Look, I'll give you back
all of your money.

28:18.739 --> 28:19.774
You just give me the ring.

28:36.924 --> 28:38.039

No! You can trust me.
Look, you can trust me.

If I wanted to set you up, Iwould have.
Don't hurt him.

I'll think of something else.

Thank you.

Anyway,

31:09.785 --> 31:12.197
how could I let Prince Charming die?

31:14.081 --> 31:17.164
I told you, I have a name.

It's James.

Yeah, not me at all.

And the joy on her face?

36:42.326 --> 36:45.659
Well, it's put me in quite
the forgiving mood.

your insubordination later.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.451
Do you know
what insubordination means?

36:54.880 --> 36:56.791
It means you're grounded.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.137
Thank you for finding my David.

Um, I don't understand.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.305
You didn't...

37:11.397 --> 37:13.558
You didn't know
that he was here in a coma?

37:14.233 --> 37:18.226
A few years ago, David and I
were not getting along.

37:18.946 --> 37:20.937
It was my fault. I know that now.

37:22.199 --> 37:24.941
I was difficult and unsupportive.

37:25.035 --> 37:26.991
I told him if he didn't like things,
he could leave.

37:27.079 --> 37:28.364
And he did.

37:28.455 --> 37:30.161
And I didn't stop him.

37:31.208 --> 37:32.789
It was the worst mistake I ever made.

37:33.669 --> 37:35.205
You didn't go look for him?

37:36.422 --> 37:39.459
I assumed he left town all this time.

37:39.550 --> 37:41.336
Now I know why I never heard from him.

37:42.845 --> 37:45.461
Now I get to do
what I've wanted to do forever.

37:45.556 --> 37:47.342
Say I'm sorry.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.300
Now we got a second chance.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.400
That's wonderful.

38:03.407 --> 38:05.693
Well, it's something of a miracle.

38:05.993 --> 38:07.199
He's okay?

38:07.286 --> 38:10.870
Physically, he's on the mend.
His memory is another issue.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.947
It may take time, if at all.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.030
What brought him back?

38:14.126 --> 38:15.662
That's the thing, there's no explanation.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.413
Something just clicked in him.

38:17.504 --> 38:20.291
He just got up
and decided to go for a stroll?

38:20.382 --> 38:22.338
WHALE: He woke up
and he was delirious.

38:22.843 --> 38:27.132
And his first instinct
was to go find something, I guess.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.507
Someone.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.678
Can I see him?

38:32.769 --> 38:33.975
Yeah, of course.

You're the one he was looking for.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.075
Henry...

38:55.167 --> 38:58.580
He was going to the Troll Bridge.
It's like the end of the story.

38:59.671 --> 39:03.380
Henry, he was going there because
it's the last thing I read to him.

39:03.467 --> 39:05.924
No, it's because you belong together.

39:07.596 --> 39:08.881
Henry.

39:19.525 --> 39:20.685
Madam Mayor?

39:21.944 --> 39:23.275
Wait by the car.

39:24.446 --> 39:27.609
Miss Swan, I let you off the hook
back there. Don't press it.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.860
I'm sorry, but Mrs. Nolan?

39:29.952 --> 39:31.488
Kind of feels like
her story could be a load of crap.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.539
All this time there's a John Doe
lying around in a coma

39:34.623 --> 39:35.908
and nobody puts it in the news?

39:35.999 --> 39:37.660
Nobody goes looking?

39:38.460 --> 39:40.325
Something's not right here.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.496
Well, what else
would make sense to you?

39:45.467 --> 39:47.583
Why would Miss Nolan lie?

39:48.470 --> 39:50.426
Oh, do you think I cast a spell on her?

39:50.514 --> 39:54.052
I think it's rather strange
you've been his emergency contact

39:54.142 --> 39:55.473
all these years,

39:55.978 --> 39:58.936
and you only found her now.

39:59.565 --> 40:02.056
Well, this town is bigger than you know.

40:02.150 --> 40:04.687
It's entirely possible to get lost here.

40:05.195 --> 40:08.062
It's entirely possible
for bad things to happen.

40:08.156 --> 40:11.648
Just when it's convenient,
you manage to solve the mystery.

40:13.203 --> 40:14.192
Thanks to you.

40:14.705 --> 40:16.536
That tape you found

40:17.165 --> 40:18.780
was a stroke of genius.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.788
So we went back
and looked at past tapes.

40:21.878 --> 40:24.164
Turns out Mr. Doe's
been talking in his sleep.

40:25.215 --> 40:27.171
He's been calling out for a "Kathryn."

40:27.718 --> 40:30.460
After that, it wasn't hard
to put the pieces together.

40:31.430 --> 40:35.093
And here I thought you and
Mary Margaret would be pleased.

40:36.435 --> 40:37.845
True love won out.

40:42.774 --> 40:43.809
Were it not for you two,

40:43.900 --> 40:47.063
they would have lived their lives
completely alone.

40:47.946 --> 40:51.313
That's why I'm willing to forgive
your incessant rudeness.

40:51.408 --> 40:56.368
Because all this has reminded me
of something oh so very important.

40:58.248 --> 41:02.036
How grateful I am to have Henry.

41:04.338 --> 41:06.249
Because not having someone?

41:07.424 --> 41:08.413
Well,

41:10.218 --> 41:13.346
that's the worst curse imaginable.
