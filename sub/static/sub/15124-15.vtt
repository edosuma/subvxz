00:03.204 --> 00:06.140
FEMALE VOICE (over phone):
Estimated delivery time:
two minutes.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.408
It's right around the corner.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.177
Your wedding gift
is right around the corner!

00:09.210 --> 00:11.045
What a double standard.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.146
Barney gets
to track a package,

00:12.180 --> 00:15.516
but I slip a GPS device
onto my ex-girlfriend's car,

00:15.549 --> 00:18.319
and I have to stay 500 feet
away from her.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.321
Estimated delivery time:
one minute.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.522
It's here!

00:21.555 --> 00:23.424
Let's go
to the loading dock.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.360
Now, I know

00:26.394 --> 00:27.295
it's a little extravagant,

00:27.328 --> 00:28.762
but you two are almost
like family to me.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.398
And I got a healthy bonus

00:30.431 --> 00:31.399
after suppressing
Sabrina's union movement

00:31.432 --> 00:32.500
for the fifth straight year.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.335
(laughs)
Here you go,
Mr. Hughes.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.337
Oh. What's in here?

00:36.370 --> 00:39.373
The knobs?

00:39.407 --> 00:42.376
This handmade armoire looked
a lot bigger on the Web site.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.545
50 bucks to ship this?

00:44.578 --> 00:46.414
You paid extra
for the real-time GPS tracking

00:46.447 --> 00:47.448
with the sexy voice.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.184
Your package is delivered.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.786
To hear me say
"your package" again,

00:52.820 --> 00:54.788
please press one.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.790
(beep)

00:56.824 --> 00:58.792
Your... package.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.797
* Whoo

01:03.831 --> 01:08.569
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

01:08.602 --> 01:11.605
Okay, here we go.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.409
(yells, groans)

01:15.443 --> 01:17.378
(laughs)
(groans)

01:17.411 --> 01:19.380
If you let me watch those
telenovelas like I wanted,

01:19.413 --> 01:21.382
maybe I could understand
these Spanish instructions.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.816
I know you're not
enjoying it now,

01:22.850 --> 01:25.119
but my scrapbook
about how we turned Jimmy's room

01:25.153 --> 01:27.421
into a scrapbooking room
is going to be hilarious.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.423
Okay, now we're doing
red and white to brown,

01:29.457 --> 01:32.160
blue to purple. Ready?

01:32.193 --> 01:33.594
(electrical hissing)
(groaning)

01:33.627 --> 01:35.129
(thudding, groaning)

01:35.163 --> 01:37.565
I think we need help.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.600
MAN (on TV):
And now on Kids Net,

01:39.633 --> 01:42.570
America's favorite teen wizard,
Yo Zappa Do.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.405
Zappa Do.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.274
Oh, no. Cici's
covered in spaghetti,

01:46.307 --> 01:48.176
and Mom told us
to keep an eye on her!

01:48.209 --> 01:49.177
(studio audience laughing)

01:49.210 --> 01:51.812
Maybe we should have kept
two eyes on her.

01:51.845 --> 01:52.746
(studio audience laughing)

01:52.780 --> 01:55.416
Cici, you're gonna get me
into trouble.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.850
(blows raspberry)

01:56.884 --> 01:58.519
(blows raspberry)

01:58.552 --> 02:00.621
Hope really seems to
like this little girl.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.224
Looks like it's time to call...

02:03.257 --> 02:05.626
BOTH:
Yo Zappa Do! Yo Zappa Do!

02:05.659 --> 02:07.628
Hurry up and help us!
We need you!

02:07.661 --> 02:10.664
(studio audience cheering
and applauding)

02:10.698 --> 02:12.866
Yo, yo, yo, what do you say?

02:12.900 --> 02:15.536
Here I am to save the day.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.208
Oh, my God.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.342
That's Trevor.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.180
JIMMY:
Trevor is Barney's
ex-wife's son.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.216
And when he came
to visit Barney,

02:28.249 --> 02:30.451
he kind of had a thing
for Sabrina.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.454
So, obviously,
we didn't get along very well.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.623
Now he's on my TV.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.191
Wow!

02:37.225 --> 02:39.193
(blowing raspberries)

02:41.829 --> 02:43.797
So how do we do this?

02:43.831 --> 02:45.666
How do we pick the
right day laborer?

02:45.699 --> 02:47.401
Well, what are you
asking me for?

02:47.435 --> 02:49.637
You're the landscaper.
You've done this before.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.305
Well, yeah, for
pickup soccer games

02:51.339 --> 02:52.506
or riding the
carpool lane.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.841
Never for something
important,

02:53.874 --> 02:56.310
like translating
fan instructions.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.678
All right, well,
just pull up.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.314
We'll look
for someone with glasses.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.250
No, no, no!

03:02.283 --> 03:03.517
We-we just need one.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.818
I am Juan.
No.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.554
Not Juan. One.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.423
One person who can read this
and speak English.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.459
MAN:
I can.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.363
Ricardo?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.565
I think you mean
Natesville Radish

03:17.598 --> 03:21.269
superstar pitcher,
"Rocket" Ricardo.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.670
Not anymore.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.439
Now I am
"Dig Your Sewer Line" Ricardo.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.241
The Radishes cut me
because they said

03:27.275 --> 03:28.909
my conditioning was not
at a level they required.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.944
(panting)

03:33.547 --> 03:35.549
Out.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.417
What about
Sabrina's mother?

03:36.450 --> 03:38.519
She's got money.
You still dating her?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.853
Apparently,
my conditioning is not

03:39.887 --> 03:41.389
at a level she required, either.

03:41.422 --> 03:44.292
(panting)

03:44.325 --> 03:46.694
(door closes)

03:46.727 --> 03:50.331
Well, at least you know
this is as bad as it can get.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.265
(siren whoops)

03:51.299 --> 03:53.667
Immigration!

03:59.440 --> 04:01.575
(panting)

04:04.778 --> 04:07.781
You're legal.
Why'd you run?

04:07.815 --> 04:10.884
I was trying to catch one
and hoped there was a reward.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.654
(panting)

04:13.687 --> 04:15.423
(whirring)

04:15.456 --> 04:17.291
Huh.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.559
Thanks, Ricardo.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.328
How much owe you we?

04:20.361 --> 04:22.896
Just talk normal, Burt.
He speaks English.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.732
Trying I am.
Shocked too much I've been.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.300
We are friends.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.801
It is my pleasure
to give you a room

04:27.835 --> 04:28.936
to fill your books with scraps.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.772
Because friends help each
other when they are down.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.742
But we're not friends.
We're not?

04:34.775 --> 04:35.743
We're family.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.445
Oh.
Your son

04:37.478 --> 04:38.412
is married to the woman

04:38.446 --> 04:40.314
whose mother
I was most recently pleasuring.

04:40.348 --> 04:43.384
In a sexual manner.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.618
And that makes us... family.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.454
I'm not really sure
that that's...

04:46.487 --> 04:49.323
And family gives
whatever family needs.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.592
If you, Burt and
Virginia recently

04:51.625 --> 04:53.994
were to be cut
from your minor league team

04:54.027 --> 04:57.798
and be thrown out into
the streets by your lover,

04:57.831 --> 04:59.800
I would take you in
and let you sleep

04:59.833 --> 05:01.335
in my scrapbooking room.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.003
Do you need a place to stay?

05:03.036 --> 05:04.472
(laughing):
See?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.674
You cannot keep a secret
from family.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.943
(laughing)

05:09.977 --> 05:11.812
Well, I knew Trevor
went out to Hollywood

05:11.845 --> 05:14.648
and was auditioning,
but I had no idea he was famous.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.649
I can't believe
my ex-wife

05:15.683 --> 05:16.784
isn't keeping me in the loop

05:16.817 --> 05:18.419
about what's going on
with her son

05:18.452 --> 05:19.387
from two husbands after me.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.954
Hope loves his show.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.557
She's obsessed
with that little girl Cici.

05:23.591 --> 05:24.658
You think you could
talk to Trevor

05:24.692 --> 05:26.427
and get Hope an autograph?

05:26.460 --> 05:27.661
I can do better than that.

05:27.695 --> 05:30.398
How about I call Trevor and get
you tickets to see the show?

05:30.431 --> 05:31.632
(gasps)
Then I could fly
you out there

05:31.665 --> 05:33.066
to meet Cici in person.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.403
Wow. That is so generous
of you, but...

05:35.436 --> 05:36.504
We're listening.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.506
Well, after that giant disaster
of the tiny armoire,

05:38.539 --> 05:40.040
I still owe you a wedding gift.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.409
It could be your honeymoon.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.511
That would be awesome!

05:43.544 --> 05:44.512
Though I never
really considered

05:44.545 --> 05:45.679
going on a honeymoon
with Hope.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.515
I mean, I love her.
It's just that...

05:47.548 --> 05:49.683
Jimmy and I don't really
get a lot of time alone.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.385
Look, I want to make
this happen for you two.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.853
I'll babysit Hope,

05:52.886 --> 05:53.787
and we'll stay at Trevor's.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.423
I let him stay
with me when he was here.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.056
I'm sure
he's got room for us.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.491
Barney, we can't let you

05:57.525 --> 05:59.460
spend that kind of money on us.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.293
It's not money.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.095
I've got ten million
Howdy's Bucks.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.832
I scan my card every time
a customer doesn't have theirs.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.067
If I had known you were
giving away free honeymoons,

06:07.100 --> 06:08.536
I wouldn't have ruined
every relationship

06:08.569 --> 06:10.070
I've ever been in

06:10.103 --> 06:12.906
by being emotionally detached
and slightly creepy.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.444
James, Sabrina, I am taking
care of your honeymoon.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.911
End of discussion.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.780
Thank you so much!

06:19.813 --> 06:21.715
Let's go book
a flight.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.116
He said, "end of discussion."

06:23.150 --> 06:25.453
Oh, my God,
this is terrible.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.520
I can't fly on a plane.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.088
I hear you, man.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.691
The TSA can have
my 12 ounces of liquid

06:30.724 --> 06:33.427
when they pry it out
of my cold, dead hand.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.429
No, Frank.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.431
(whispering):
I'm scared of flying.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.099
Are you kidding me?

06:39.132 --> 06:41.802
Hey, being scared of flying
doesn't make you a wimp.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.037
Every time
they flew on a mission,

06:44.071 --> 06:46.073
the A-Team had to give Mr. T

06:46.106 --> 06:47.908
a glass of milk
and sleeping pills.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.777
Pretty sure
that was a character flaw

06:49.810 --> 06:50.911
a group of writers created

06:50.944 --> 06:53.647
to build tension between scenes
that actually mattered.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.450
Look, just tell her
you're scared.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.451
I can't tell her that.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.920
I don't want to be
the reason she doesn't get

06:59.953 --> 07:01.522
to go somewhere cool
on our honeymoon.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.457
L.A. is not that cool, man.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.459
They don't have
a pro football team,

07:05.493 --> 07:06.927
there's tons of traffic,

07:06.960 --> 07:09.930
and they make their porn stars
wear condoms,

07:09.963 --> 07:11.899
which is totally
shortsighted thinking.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.901
How the hell do they expect

07:13.934 --> 07:15.969
to get the next generation
of porn stars?

07:21.174 --> 07:22.209
(birds singing)

07:24.512 --> 07:26.780
(sniffing)

07:26.814 --> 07:28.482
Ugh!

07:28.516 --> 07:29.517
Ooh!

07:29.550 --> 07:30.584
Is it trash day?

07:30.618 --> 07:33.186
No. Oh.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.989
And the sardine cannery
doesn't open for another hour.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.925
Aah! Ooh!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.960
It smells like
somebody died.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.229
BOTH:
Maw Maw!

07:43.531 --> 07:45.799
Relax. I'm still here.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.200
House isn't yours yet.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.203
Before your amigo started taking

07:50.237 --> 07:51.839
his hour-long shower,

07:51.872 --> 07:55.142
he decided
to cook huevos stinkeros.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.245
(all groaning)

07:59.012 --> 08:00.814
(coughing)

08:00.848 --> 08:02.983
(liquid gurgling)

08:05.152 --> 08:07.187
I got to know
what's in that pot.
No, don't.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.022
It'll just release more
of the funk.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.561
I'm sorry.
I'm going in. I love you.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.162
(gasps)

08:15.195 --> 08:16.997
(muffled retching)

08:17.030 --> 08:18.732
It's got eyes!

08:18.766 --> 08:19.800
(groans)

08:19.833 --> 08:21.969
Oh, great.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.203
Now I got to see.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.238
(both groaning)

08:27.941 --> 08:30.177
Oh. Oh!

08:30.210 --> 08:32.546
Oh, God!

08:32.580 --> 08:33.747
I think it winked at me.

08:33.781 --> 08:34.815
(whimpers)

08:34.848 --> 08:35.816
(groans)

08:35.849 --> 08:37.050
Good morning.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.186
The best part
of waking up

08:39.219 --> 08:40.821
is... (sniffs)

08:40.854 --> 08:42.189
...sheep's head soup
in your cup.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.024
(muffled retching)

08:44.057 --> 08:46.159
Once his eyes roll
into the back of his head,

08:46.193 --> 08:47.695
you know he's good and tender.

08:47.728 --> 08:48.929
Is that my Capitals shirt?

08:48.962 --> 08:49.997
Yes.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.700
Uh, I spilled my breakfast
on your Redskins jersey.

08:52.733 --> 08:57.571
So, as an apology, I used
our fancy scrapbooking scissors

08:57.605 --> 08:59.072
to, uh, give it
a little more flare.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.875
Ricardo, we need to talk
about you staying here.
Yeah.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.176
You don't have to say
another word.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.613
Yeah.
You've already done
so much for me.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.015
Oh, so glad you
understand.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.617
Of course I understand.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.852
It is clear by your
expressions that you are

09:11.885 --> 09:14.855
as happy to have me live here
as I am to be here.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.690
And to thank you,

09:16.724 --> 09:18.626
tonight I will cook you
the grandest feet

09:18.659 --> 09:20.027
you have ever tasted.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.863
I think you mean "feast."

09:22.896 --> 09:23.864
No.

09:23.897 --> 09:24.965
(groans)

09:32.673 --> 09:33.641
Nicely done.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.076
Frank, what are
you doing?

09:36.109 --> 09:38.111
It's my marketing masterpiece--

09:38.145 --> 09:39.713
soda Jenga.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.615
If a customer can pull
a 12-pack out

09:41.649 --> 09:44.084
without the tower falling,
they get it for half price.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.754
The big boys in Wichita
are finally gonna know the name

09:46.787 --> 09:48.622
"Frank Marolla"
for something other

09:48.656 --> 09:50.658
than the big lobster
escape of '09.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.092
I'm sure they still
very clearly remember

09:52.125 --> 09:54.662
the "be your own butcher"
fiasco when Barney left you

09:54.695 --> 09:56.129
in charge to get
his lap-band surgery.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.998
That would've worked if that
stupid sheep didn't wander out

09:58.031 --> 10:00.133
into the street
with a hatchet in its back.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.135
I'm gonna go find Barney
and make sure

10:02.169 --> 10:04.772
we're not late for the airport.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.240
Ready for your flight,
Captain Sully Wussenberger?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.942
Look, I think I'll be okay.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.111
I'm just trying not
to think about it.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.245
I mean, for the first
20 seconds or so,

10:12.279 --> 10:14.347
we'll just be on the ground,
so it'll be like a fast bus.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.650
And then we're gonna go up in
the sky and that'll be nice,

10:16.684 --> 10:18.919
until we eventually plummet
back down to our fiery deaths,

10:18.952 --> 10:20.721
'cause if God had
meant for us to fly,

10:20.754 --> 10:21.655
he would have given us
propeller fingers.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.657
Calm down.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.625
Here, have a brownie.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.862
Something to wash it down?

10:28.896 --> 10:29.963
Thanks.

10:29.997 --> 10:30.964
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.733
Take it easy.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.034
That's two percent milk.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.136
98% tranquilizer.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.270
What?

10:37.304 --> 10:38.672
You're welcome, Mr. T.

10:38.706 --> 10:39.940
Oh, damn it.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.942
I don't want
to fall asleep.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.677
How am I going to explain
that to Sabrina?

10:43.711 --> 10:45.679
Frank, I know I said no,
but I like it.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.681
A display like this could
knock day-old white bread

10:47.715 --> 10:49.750
right off the top
of the best-seller list.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.785
(gasps)

10:51.819 --> 10:54.154
Somebody should probably
call an ambulance.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.288
They never
really showed

10:55.322 --> 10:57.157
how many sleeping pills
they gave Mr. T,

10:57.190 --> 10:59.126
so I had to guesstimate.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.730
(TV playing quietly)

11:02.763 --> 11:04.898
Is this yours?

11:04.932 --> 11:05.899
Uh...

11:05.933 --> 11:07.868
(sniffs)
Nope. Ricardo.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.739
What are you guys
doing here?

11:11.772 --> 11:12.973
Jimmy's afraid
of flying.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.742
And also apparently
afraid to tell me that.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.810
Which would have been nice
to hear before I wasted

11:16.844 --> 11:19.146
ten million Howdy's Bucks on
nonrefundable airline tickets.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.014
I could have gotten
a dune buggy.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.050
So, we're just here to pick up
some pillows and blankets

11:23.083 --> 11:24.752
so we can sleep in the back
of Barney's SUV.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.988
He is going to be
driving us to Los Angeles.

11:28.021 --> 11:28.989
Shotgun!

11:29.022 --> 11:31.158
No. Maw Maw, you can't come.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.193
This is our honeymoon-- it's
our only chance to be alone.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.864
Well, it's my only chance
to give Wilfred his dying wish.

11:36.897 --> 11:40.200
He always wanted
his ashes spread in the ocean

11:40.233 --> 11:42.069
so fish would choke on him.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.236
(chuckling):
He hated fish..

11:43.270 --> 11:44.371
Oh, we have
to take her.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.206
It's for love--
what better way

11:46.239 --> 11:47.374
to honor your honeymoon?

11:47.407 --> 11:48.742
Well, if everybody else
is going,

11:48.776 --> 11:49.877
we're going, too.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.745
Why would we squeeze
into a crowded car

11:51.779 --> 11:54.181
for God knows how many hours...
RICARDO:
Okay, nobody come

11:54.214 --> 11:55.415
in the bathroom.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.451
I'm using the tub
to marinate pigs' feet.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.453
I'll get our bags.
SABRINA:
Not to be

12:00.487 --> 12:03.223
the crazy one-- or the sane one,
I'm not really quite sure--

12:03.256 --> 12:05.425
but this is
our honeymoon.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.961
Trevor's a big star. The rest
of us can stay at his place.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.197
If I've learned anything
from watching Entourage,

12:10.230 --> 12:12.099
it's that they all
live in huge houses

12:12.132 --> 12:13.901
and everything always
works out in the end.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.068
Well, then it's settled.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.104
We're all going.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.807
Where are we
all going?

12:19.840 --> 12:20.908
(groans)

12:20.941 --> 12:21.775
RICARDO:
* Take one down

12:21.809 --> 12:23.076
* Pass it around

12:23.110 --> 12:24.377
* Hundred bottles of beer
on the wall *

12:24.411 --> 12:26.246
* A hundred bottles
of beer on the wall *

12:26.279 --> 12:27.848
* A hundred bottles of beer

12:27.881 --> 12:29.416
* Take one down,
pass it around *

12:29.449 --> 12:31.384
* A hundred bottles of beer
on the wall *

12:31.418 --> 12:33.220
* A hundred bottles
of beer on the wall *

12:33.253 --> 12:35.222
* Hundred bottles of beer...

12:35.255 --> 12:36.289
(whispers):
I pity the fool

12:36.323 --> 12:39.059
who has to stay awake
for this entire car trip.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.228
* A hundred bottles
of beer on the wall *

12:41.261 --> 12:42.262
* A hundred bottles of beer

12:42.295 --> 12:44.231
* Take one down,
pass it around *

12:44.264 --> 12:46.266
* Hundred bottles
of beer on the wall... *

12:51.171 --> 12:53.240
JIMMY:
Barney had volunteered
to drive us all to Los Angeles,

12:53.273 --> 12:56.243
and like most long car trips,
it was kind of a drag.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.811
First we listened to his
yet-to-be-self-published

12:57.845 --> 12:59.246
autobiographical audio book.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.848
BARNEY (recorded):
I rode my first love

13:00.881 --> 13:03.283
from the early morning
deep into the night.

13:03.316 --> 13:06.453
No force on this earth
could ever pull me off her.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.022
She was a five-speed
Stingray fastback.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.258
Banana seat?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.259
Yes.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.260
Sissy bar?

13:13.293 --> 13:15.028
You bet your ass.

13:16.997 --> 13:20.300
And then we all watched
the DVD of Jazzoo,

13:20.333 --> 13:22.970
Barney's free-form
kazoo jazz band.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.906
(kazoos playing lively jazz)

13:28.141 --> 13:30.844
Then Barney decided
to pick up a hitchhiker.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.045
(panicked screaming)

13:34.915 --> 13:36.850
(Barney gasping in fear)

13:36.884 --> 13:39.119
Easy mistake, guys.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.520
I thought guys
with dreadlocks

13:40.553 --> 13:42.155
were supposed
to be chill.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.390
(panting)

13:45.158 --> 13:47.861
And once the radio
started only picking up

13:47.895 --> 13:50.898
Spanish music stations,
we knew we had finally arrived

13:50.931 --> 13:52.565
in Los Angeles.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.167
Look.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.469
It's the Ventura Boulevard
Sheryl Crow sang about.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.338
Let me out.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.073
This is where
I will be discovered.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.141
Actually, I think
she was singing

14:01.174 --> 14:02.342
about Santa Monica Boulevard.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.012
A boulevard's a boulevard.
Good luck, buddy.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.079
Yeah.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.319
Oh, excuse me, where is
the office to sign up

14:12.352 --> 14:15.088
to become famous, like
Mel Gibson or the Ocho Mama.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.928
Oh, excuse me...

14:22.963 --> 14:25.198
BARNEY:
Chapter 47.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.200
The day I met Sabrina,
I promised myself

14:27.234 --> 14:29.336
that I'd one day spread
rose petals

14:29.369 --> 14:31.338
in a honeymoon suite for her.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.106
I just thought the tears
I'd be crying

14:33.140 --> 14:34.607
would be tears of joy.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.543
(crying)

14:36.576 --> 14:38.045
(gasping)

14:38.078 --> 14:40.080
Enjoy your honeymoon.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.052
Let me tell you something
that's gonna make your honeymoon

14:45.085 --> 14:46.419
a little more exciting.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.555
It's a move
your mother and I invented.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.223
It's called
the Minnesota pretzel.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.960
Okay, if he mentions any sex act

14:52.993 --> 14:54.928
involving a Midwestern state
or a stadium snack food,

14:54.962 --> 14:56.396
don't do it.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.565
There's gonna be a birthday
or an anniversary you forget,

14:58.598 --> 15:01.668
and you're gonna wish you
hadn't already played that card.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.942
I don't care
what you mother says.

15:08.976 --> 15:12.412
I want to do that crazy thing
that we always talked about.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.913
Hmm?

15:20.187 --> 15:22.322
Ready.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.926
Me, too.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.067
Oh, by the way,

15:34.101 --> 15:36.603
this corset came with this whip.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.238
Should we use it?

15:38.271 --> 15:41.108
Uh, well, we both bruise
really easily,

15:41.141 --> 15:44.311
so maybe we should wait
and work our way up to the whip.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.414
Okay.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.249
(knocking)
Oh, I ordered champagne

15:49.282 --> 15:50.250
and onion rings
from room service.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.519
Your favorites.
Oh.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.189
Dress-up sex
on your honeymoon?

15:56.223 --> 15:57.690
You're leaving yourself
nowhere to go

15:57.724 --> 15:59.392
on a rainy Thursday
in year four.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.062
Jimmy, my instructions

16:02.095 --> 16:03.696
were kiss, get undressed,
then do it.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.665
Not doing it dressed like KISS.

16:05.698 --> 16:06.933
BARNEY:
I'm sorry, James.

16:06.966 --> 16:11.038
Uh, we ran into a little issue
when we showed up at Trevor's.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.077
(buzzes)

16:17.110 --> 16:18.445
Uh, hello.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.513
Is Trevor there?

16:22.182 --> 16:23.016
Look at that.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.651
The kid's so rich
he's got monkey money.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.453
Remember how we always said,
if we ever got rich,

16:26.486 --> 16:27.520
that's the first thing we'd buy?

16:27.554 --> 16:29.489
If you get rich, buy a kangaroo.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.358
Why would we want a kangaroo?

16:31.391 --> 16:33.126
They don't roller-skate.
They don't wear suits.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.228
And I've never seen a kangaroo
smoke a cigarette.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.296
They're useless.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.730
One, they box,

16:37.764 --> 16:39.299
so you've got a bodyguard.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.034
Two, their pouch.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.137
All the benefits of a fanny pack
without looking like a dork.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.338
Three, when they die,

16:45.372 --> 16:49.742
their skin and a pogo stick
make one hell of a costume.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.212
Virginia, she's
selling me on kangaroo.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.447
She makes a good point.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.151
Oh, Barney.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.719
Thought you said "Barry."

16:59.752 --> 17:02.189
Look, I know what
I said earlier

17:02.222 --> 17:03.490
about maybe you being
able to stay here,

17:03.523 --> 17:06.559
but that's just not gonna work
out now that I got a pet chimp.

17:06.593 --> 17:10.063
But I saw in a magazine
you have seven bedrooms, though.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.198
Yeah, it's a big
house, but, uh,

17:11.231 --> 17:13.066
the chimp takes up
a lot of space,

17:13.100 --> 17:14.667
and I like to keep
a few rooms available

17:14.701 --> 17:17.070
just in case several people
I care about show up.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.506
Well, sorry I can't
help you out, bud,

17:19.539 --> 17:21.174
but I'll see you
tomorrow at the show.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.309
Zap you later.

17:24.244 --> 17:27.280
Barney's all out
of Howdy's Bucks,

17:27.314 --> 17:28.548
and in case
you've forgotten,

17:28.581 --> 17:30.217
we're very poor, so...

17:30.250 --> 17:32.185
That "so" means
we're staying here.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.155
I call the bed.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.158
You two feel free
to work around me.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.126
Just be prepared

17:39.159 --> 17:42.562
for some harsh
yet constructive criticism.

17:42.595 --> 17:43.796
(grunts)

17:47.600 --> 17:49.136
Hey, guys,

17:49.169 --> 17:51.304
they just started
serving breakfast downstairs.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.505
You might want
to get down there quick

17:52.539 --> 17:55.242
before they run out of Danish.
Jimmy and I will meet you

17:55.275 --> 17:56.843
down there in 15 or 20 minutes
after we get ready.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.379
Alone.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.780
On our honeymoon.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.149
Oh, I don't know.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.550
Don't want to miss the Danish.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.118
You're gonna want
to stick around.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.119
I'm not leaving.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.487
The news is on.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.323
I want to see what Lindsey Lohan
did last night.

18:10.357 --> 18:13.260
(chuckles)
I love that little piece
of trash.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.162
In an attempt to appeal
to Southern California's

18:15.195 --> 18:17.397
fastest growing demographic,
single Latino women,

18:17.430 --> 18:20.167
I would like to introduce
our new hunky weatherman,

18:20.200 --> 18:21.234
Sunny Reyes.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.236
Thank you, Steve.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.438
As you can see,
today's weather's gonna be...

18:25.472 --> 18:27.174
muy caliente.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.442
Oh, my God, it's Ricardo.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.443
And tomorrow's weather

18:30.477 --> 18:32.779
is gonna be... (chuckles)

18:32.812 --> 18:34.181
Who cares?

18:34.214 --> 18:36.149
I live for today.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.450
Let's dance!

18:37.484 --> 18:39.486
(salsa music playing)

18:43.523 --> 18:46.626
Our drain at home is clogged
with the hair of a celebrity.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.195
(yells)

18:48.228 --> 18:49.462
MAN:
From the man

18:49.496 --> 18:51.764
who brought you some
of your favorite TV shows

18:51.798 --> 18:53.866
such as Strudel and Hyman,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.435
Mr. Fuzzy Pants

18:55.468 --> 18:58.171
and two unaired episodes
of Mama's Family,

18:58.205 --> 18:59.172
please welcome

18:59.206 --> 19:02.809
the director of Yo Zappa Do,

19:02.842 --> 19:04.311
Stu Levine.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.246
(applause)

19:07.314 --> 19:08.515
Hey.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.882
I say, "Yo Zappa,"

19:09.916 --> 19:11.784
you say...
ALL: Do!

19:11.818 --> 19:13.453
No. You don't say anything

19:13.486 --> 19:15.288
until the light goes on
that says "laugh."

19:15.322 --> 19:16.456
All right?

19:16.489 --> 19:17.690
Now, let's shoot this baby.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.559
I got to get out of here
in time to take

19:19.592 --> 19:20.860
my pet kangaroo out for a jump.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.463
Ooh, look, it's Trevor.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.498
Hey, Trevor!

19:25.532 --> 19:29.269
We're here!
Thanks for the seats.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.238
Please, ma'am,
I don't come to your work

19:31.271 --> 19:32.705
and bother you
in your tiny little cubicle.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.341
Did you hear that?

19:34.374 --> 19:36.443
He thinks I work
in a cubicle.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.247
Look at you, Cici.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.315
How are you gonna get
cleaned up in time?

19:44.384 --> 19:46.219
BOTH:
Yo Zappa Do! Yo Zappa Do!

19:46.253 --> 19:48.521
Hurry up and help us!
We need you!

19:50.257 --> 19:52.925
(applause)

19:52.959 --> 19:54.594
Yo, yo, yo,

19:54.627 --> 19:57.530
here I am to get you
out of another jam.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.938
She made a doggone mess.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.908
Are you gonna be a good girl
and clean up your face?

20:08.941 --> 20:11.711
Or am I gonna have
to zappa do this place?

20:13.613 --> 20:15.715
I said,

20:15.748 --> 20:18.285
"Are you gonna be a good girl
and clean up your face?

20:18.318 --> 20:20.953
Or am I gonna have
to zappa do this place?"

20:23.756 --> 20:24.724
(coughing)

20:24.757 --> 20:26.359
(sighs)

20:26.393 --> 20:27.694
Not again.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.262
Come on, kid, that's your cue.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.298
Give him the raspberry.
Drew Barrymore could have

20:31.331 --> 20:32.231
done this drunk at your age.

20:34.601 --> 20:35.568
(blows raspberry)

20:35.602 --> 20:37.003
Who just did that?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.273
(blows raspberry)
It was her.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.974
(raspberries continue)

20:45.011 --> 20:47.314
(sighs)

20:47.347 --> 20:50.650
Are you gonna be a good girl
and clean up your face?

20:50.683 --> 20:53.553
Or am I gonna have
to zappa do this place?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.554
(blows raspberry)

20:54.587 --> 20:56.356
(laughter)

20:56.389 --> 20:58.325
(applause)

21:00.360 --> 21:01.661
I can't believe it.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.330
Hope's gonna be a star.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.299
I'm sorry. I know this is not
the honeymoon you pictured.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.734
No, no, it's way better.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.402
Plus, I-I'm kind of glad

21:09.436 --> 21:11.671
we didn't end up drinking
each other's blood.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.005
Wait, is the show over?

21:13.039 --> 21:15.608
Well, is he gonna clean
Cici's face or not?

21:15.642 --> 21:16.909
I think it's a two-parter.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.312
You have to watch next
week to see what happens.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.947
You mean like
a "to be continued"?

21:20.980 --> 21:24.351
Do they still do those?

21:24.384 --> 21:25.385
(stammering)
