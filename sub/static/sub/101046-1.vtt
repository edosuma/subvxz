WEBVTT

01:36.238 --> 01:38.140
Take your shot
when you're ready.

02:24.987 --> 02:26.055
No!

02:29.492 --> 02:30.926
Status!

02:30.993 --> 02:33.229
<i>I'm good.
Package is secure.</i>

02:33.295 --> 02:34.497
<i>I have to make my way
back to you as soon</i>

02:34.562 --> 02:36.065
<i>as I get a visual on the enemy.</i>

02:36.132 --> 02:38.367
Pile Driver, this is Storm.
We have a man down.

02:38.434 --> 02:40.568
We have the package.
I repeat, we have the package.

02:40.635 --> 02:41.971
We need a dust off immediately.

02:42.038 --> 02:44.006
<i>Copy.
Confirmation understood.</i>

02:44.073 --> 02:45.341
<i>Dust off should be there
any second.</i>

02:45.408 --> 02:46.808
<i>Hang in there, Storm.</i>

02:46.876 --> 02:48.110
Get your ass back here, Oliver.

02:49.879 --> 02:51.113
We have 24 hours to get
that package in containment.

03:05.327 --> 03:06.561
Make it quick, soldier.

03:06.628 --> 03:07.963
I've got movement over here.

03:08.030 --> 03:09.899
Hold them off while
we scan for ID.

03:11.267 --> 03:14.036
Sir, they're comin' in hot
and fast.

03:35.357 --> 03:38.060
Pile Driver, we need to get this
package to containment now!

03:39.895 --> 03:43.798
<i>Landing now!
16 degrees southwest.</i>

03:48.736 --> 03:50.638
Valkyrie's landed,
let's move out.

04:19.468 --> 04:25.141
It's no secret the Air Force
is short on pilots these days.

04:25.207 --> 04:28.410
However, candidates must
still meet strict physical,

04:28.477 --> 04:32.214
medical, vision and
academic requirements.

04:32.281 --> 04:36.784
After that, applicants
must score well on the AFOQT

04:36.851 --> 04:39.955
and pass a selection board.

04:44.059 --> 04:47.662
Becoming a pilot is
a service to one's country.

04:50.566 --> 04:55.171
It is a privilege and a way of
life that is not for everyone.

04:55.237 --> 04:59.041
But occasionally,
and I stress occasionally,

04:59.108 --> 05:02.244
the Air Force finds itself
with candidates that surpass

05:02.311 --> 05:06.148
those measures, candidates
that by God's grace,

05:06.215 --> 05:11.253
or whatever you believe in,
are made to be Air Force pilots.

05:11.320 --> 05:14.890
Those born with exceptional
skills and talents.

05:14.957 --> 05:19.061
However, sometimes those
rare few fall pray

05:19.128 --> 05:22.631
to the Icarus paradox
if left unchecked.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.401
While one must be prepared
to take it to the edge,

05:25.467 --> 05:30.105
one must remain always
in control of their actions.

05:30.172 --> 05:34.443
Those actions can be a matter
of not only life or death,

05:34.510 --> 05:38.247
but of all those engaged
in the battle with them.

05:41.849 --> 05:45.955
Only the very best rise
to Top Gunner.

06:03.372 --> 06:05.441
Blue 42!

06:05.507 --> 06:07.142
Blue 42!

06:08.810 --> 06:11.146
Blue 42! Set! Hut!

06:11.213 --> 06:14.883
1-1000! 2-1000, 3-1000
here I come.

06:19.021 --> 06:20.855
Oh, shit!
She hits hard!

06:21.991 --> 06:23.459
How about that!

06:38.207 --> 06:39.708
All right, cadets!
Clean up!

06:39.774 --> 06:41.477
We got air drills
in 30 minutes.

06:41.543 --> 06:43.012
Woo hoo hoo!

06:43.078 --> 06:44.647
- Not a fan of "princess".
- Whatever.

06:44.713 --> 06:47.950
Marcus, Brown, Spieling,
you three cadets are training

06:48.017 --> 06:50.519
to become pilots in
the U.S. Air Force.

06:50.586 --> 06:53.689
This is a training base.
No messin' around up here.

06:53.756 --> 06:56.824
We need you ready for combat,
no stunts this time.

06:56.892 --> 06:59.328
I'll be watching
your every move.

06:59.395 --> 07:02.231
The choices you make today
will determine the course

07:02.298 --> 07:04.333
of your trajectory
in the Air Force.

07:35.931 --> 07:39.001
Lookin' mighty sexy, Sparrow.

07:39.068 --> 07:40.536
Focus, Cowboy.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.373
I can see those
baby blues from here.

07:45.574 --> 07:48.210
Hey, where's my kiss?

07:49.778 --> 07:53.449
Okay, Cowboy, eyes on the road.
You make Spielman jealous.

07:54.883 --> 07:56.919
You guys good?

07:59.655 --> 08:01.190
All right, let's take
it to 'em.

08:11.567 --> 08:13.369
Ho-ho, wow!

08:15.337 --> 08:16.705
Woo hoo hoo!

08:16.772 --> 08:18.140
Cowboy, what are you doing?

08:18.207 --> 08:19.641
You're gonna get us
all in trouble!

08:20.342 --> 08:22.411
You'd have to catch me first.

08:27.349 --> 08:29.218
Woo!

08:29.284 --> 08:30.853
I can't help myself, Sparrow.

08:30.919 --> 08:32.955
You totally have me
turned...

08:33.020 --> 08:36.191
- No, no, no, no...
- ...upside down!

08:40.763 --> 08:44.500
Aw, damn it!
Knock that off!

08:44.566 --> 08:46.402
Ah...

08:46.468 --> 08:47.970
Hope you're happy, Cowboy.

08:48.036 --> 08:49.705
Herring's gonna ground us
for three weeks!

08:49.772 --> 08:52.040
Oh, man, grounded with
this beautiful lady?

08:52.107 --> 08:53.842
Sounds like my perfect date.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.478
In your dreams, showoff.

09:04.553 --> 09:06.755
Guys...
Guys, I'm stalling out.

09:06.822 --> 09:09.091
I'm trying to get her back up.
I've got nothing!

09:09.158 --> 09:11.126
Oh, he's dropping.

09:11.193 --> 09:13.529
You got this, Spielman.

09:28.977 --> 09:31.280
Nice catch, man. Nice!

09:33.415 --> 09:35.717
All right, let's wrap this up
so we get some chow.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.252
No arguments here.

09:38.587 --> 09:39.988
Amateurs.

09:53.969 --> 09:57.206
Oh, man, I thought
he was in a brief.

09:57.272 --> 09:59.074
Look, he's obviously
excited to see us.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.210
Nice knowin' you.

10:01.276 --> 10:03.812
I mean, I saw
enemy fighters up there.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.347
I saw 'em.

10:05.414 --> 10:07.249
Yeah, I did too.
Those enemies were all over you.

10:07.316 --> 10:09.017
If it wasn't for
my maneuvering skills...

10:09.084 --> 10:10.152
Oh, in your dreams.

10:10.219 --> 10:11.553
In somebody's dreams.

10:11.620 --> 10:12.889
- Hey, hey.
- You guys looked hot up there.

10:12.956 --> 10:14.623
Yeah, you like that?

10:14.690 --> 10:16.558
Yeah, get some pointers from me,
maybe you'll be a pilot one day.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.360
Naturally.

10:18.427 --> 10:20.128
What she said, you either got
it or you don't, you know.

10:20.195 --> 10:22.097
I don't know.
I can't describe it.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.232
I'll get back to you on that.

10:23.298 --> 10:24.733
- Really?
- Probably not.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.635
I wouldn't trust anything
this guy has to say.

10:26.702 --> 10:28.437
He's still in his
proverbial diapers.

10:28.504 --> 10:29.906
Probably doesn't have
anything to teach you.

10:29.973 --> 10:31.373
Sounds about right.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.141
Hey, look on the bright side.

10:33.208 --> 10:35.043
Maybe Spielman can take some
time out of his busy day

10:35.110 --> 10:36.645
to teach you how to stall out.

10:36.712 --> 10:37.679
Great.

10:37.746 --> 10:39.248
Oh, you know what?

10:39.314 --> 10:41.416
It looks like you guys have shit
to deal with on your own.

10:41.483 --> 10:42.651
I'm out.

10:46.688 --> 10:47.891
Sir.

10:47.957 --> 10:49.658
- Sir.
- Sir.

11:03.171 --> 11:06.675
The Air Force has invested
a lot in you three

11:06.742 --> 11:09.811
and I'm gonna see to it we get
a return on that investment.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.403
The property you treat like
toddler toys are not yours!

11:34.469 --> 11:37.339
They are the property of
the United States military!

11:37.406 --> 11:40.242
They are not to be treated
like the BMWs and Mercedes

11:40.309 --> 11:42.477
your daddies bought
you when you were 16.

11:42.544 --> 11:44.846
They belong to the Air Force.

11:44.914 --> 11:46.615
Do you understand?

11:47.683 --> 11:49.718
Do you understand!

11:49.785 --> 11:51.453
Sir.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.389
My father left when I was 12.

11:54.456 --> 11:58.061
My mother worked tirelessly
three jobs

11:58.126 --> 11:59.328
just to make sure
I could be here.

12:01.496 --> 12:04.666
Kind of a rags
to riches story... sort of.

12:07.937 --> 12:10.138
Spielman, I don't like you.

12:10.205 --> 12:13.141
I don't think you're funny
and I'm not impressed.

12:13.208 --> 12:15.444
Okay. The three of you will be
spending a long holiday weekend

12:15.510 --> 12:18.680
with myself and
Master Sergeant Kelley.

12:18.747 --> 12:23.385
Also, starting now, you're
assigned as of 2200 to 20200,

12:23.452 --> 12:25.420
Duty Office Squadron Base Ops
and Security

12:25.487 --> 12:28.657
each and every night
for the next six days!

12:29.892 --> 12:31.159
Yes, sir.

12:31.226 --> 12:32.194
One more time!

12:32.260 --> 12:33.528
Yes, sir!

12:36.798 --> 12:39.234
You still have
PT training at 0900.

12:39.301 --> 12:43.405
Now get outta my sight.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.273
Get outta my sight!

13:01.757 --> 13:03.725
From what I hear
Colonel Herring and I

13:03.792 --> 13:05.761
won't be alone
this holiday week.

13:05.827 --> 13:08.830
It was so nice of you to give up
your leave to stay here with us.

13:08.898 --> 13:10.632
I wanna make sure to have
extra turkey and cranberry sauce

13:10.699 --> 13:13.102
flown in from stateside
just for you.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.938
All right. Let's start this
week off with a little 5k jog.

13:16.005 --> 13:19.142
Attention!
Right face!

13:19.207 --> 13:20.943
Lieutenant Brown,
will you kindly lead us?

13:21.010 --> 13:21.978
Yes, Master Sergeant.

13:22.045 --> 13:24.279
Forward march!

13:24.346 --> 13:25.714

13:25.781 --> 13:27.482

13:39.528 --> 13:42.764

13:57.980 --> 13:59.481
Why are we descending?

14:00.883 --> 14:03.418
Captain. Captain Cushing?

14:10.126 --> 14:11.060
Ah!

14:11.127 --> 14:12.527
What are you doing?

14:12.594 --> 14:13.996
You were completely out!

14:14.063 --> 14:15.664
I got it!

14:29.478 --> 14:31.180
Why didn't you tell me
you were hurt?

14:31.246 --> 14:33.015
Don't worry about it.

14:33.082 --> 14:34.816
Looks like you took a bullet
through the floorboard.

14:34.884 --> 14:36.351
Bullet went straight
through the floor,

14:36.418 --> 14:38.921
hit my leg and
nicked my shoulder.

14:38.988 --> 14:40.589
I'll be fine.

14:40.655 --> 14:43.525
It looks like it might have
blown through our fuel pump.

14:43.592 --> 14:44.994
We're not makin' it.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.667
Oh!

14:54.736 --> 14:56.605
Ah!

15:04.646 --> 15:06.681
Where can we set her down?
Off the grid.

15:06.748 --> 15:08.750
There's a new air base, Asan.

15:08.817 --> 15:10.418
It's not on
everyone's radar yet.

15:10.485 --> 15:12.255
Osan?
That's not new.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.656
No.

15:14.723 --> 15:18.027
Asan.
It's in Baja, California.

15:18.094 --> 15:20.829
There's a base set up there
temporarily for SERE training

15:20.897 --> 15:23.232
and initial phase
basic flight school.

15:23.298 --> 15:26.202
But they have a runway.
I'll set us down there.

15:26.269 --> 15:28.104
We'll call for another EXFIL.

15:28.171 --> 15:29.939
Okay. Do it.

15:30.006 --> 15:31.740
You sure you can still
fly this thing?

15:33.708 --> 15:35.443
Yeah, I'll get us there.

15:37.113 --> 15:39.614
But the hydraulics for a
vertical set-down are shot.

15:39.681 --> 15:43.385
We'll take us in
the old-fashioned way.

15:43.451 --> 15:44.887
Asan TAC!

15:44.954 --> 15:48.124
This is Yankee, Charlie,
Echo, One, Niner.

15:48.191 --> 15:49.457
We're on a classified mission.

15:49.524 --> 15:51.359
We need to set down
on your base.

15:51.426 --> 15:53.162
Do you copy?

15:53.229 --> 15:55.330
<i>This is Asan TAC.</i>

15:55.397 --> 15:57.332
<i>Yankee, Charlie,
Echo One Niner,</i>

15:57.399 --> 15:59.768
<i>you are transmitting over
a restricted channel.</i>

15:59.835 --> 16:01.837
<i>Authorized clearance
is required,</i>

16:01.904 --> 16:04.840
<i>or you will be subject
to intercept.</i>

16:04.907 --> 16:05.975
Brace yourselves.

16:08.177 --> 16:10.980
Zero, Gulf, Echo,

16:11.047 --> 16:12.514
Niner, Niner,

16:12.581 --> 16:15.650
X-ray, Niner, Lima, Oscar...

16:15.717 --> 16:17.053
Confirm.

16:23.159 --> 16:26.963
Aircraft's damaged.
Got two critical.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.130
I need to take us down.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.136
All right, here we go.
Here we go.

16:34.203 --> 16:35.905
Brace for impact!

16:35.972 --> 16:38.107
Ten, nine, eight...

16:50.286 --> 16:52.188
That's a Valkyrie ATC.

16:52.255 --> 16:55.423
...five, four, three,

16:55.490 --> 16:57.226
two, one!

17:09.105 --> 17:10.438
Everybody okay?

17:10.505 --> 17:13.108
- Yeah.
- Copy that, sir. Yes, sir.

17:13.175 --> 17:14.442
How's the CRISPR?

17:29.424 --> 17:30.625
Package intact, sir.

17:53.282 --> 17:54.716
I've never seen one of those.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.718
Whoa!
You guys don't need to be here!

17:56.785 --> 17:59.355
It's off the books.
Understood?

17:59.422 --> 18:00.789
- Yeah.
- Yes, Master Sergeant.

18:00.855 --> 18:02.657
- Yes, sir.
- You'll be briefed shortly.

18:02.724 --> 18:04.826
Head on back to the barracks
until we call for you.

18:09.531 --> 18:10.465
Colonel Herring?

18:10.532 --> 18:11.901
Yes, I am.

18:11.968 --> 18:13.868
We've got one critical
and one deceased.

18:15.972 --> 18:19.574
I need a medical team dispatched
to the tarmac immediately!

18:24.280 --> 18:25.982
Can they keep their mouths shut?

18:29.118 --> 18:30.252
Yeah.

18:31.820 --> 18:35.458
Unmarked para-military
gear, state of the art.

18:35.523 --> 18:38.760
My bet's on CIA
or private sector.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.695
What do you think is
in that metal case?

18:40.762 --> 18:42.630
Whatever it is,
it's important enough

18:42.697 --> 18:45.434
for Herring to pay his respects.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.801
Let's get outta here.

18:48.770 --> 18:50.172
I don't see any windows
on that thing.

18:50.239 --> 18:51.573
Think it's a drone?

18:51.639 --> 18:53.608
How do they navigate
in close proximity?

18:53.675 --> 18:57.213
Must be some extremely
accurate GPS.

18:57.279 --> 18:59.081
I understand
it's all classified,

18:59.148 --> 19:01.317
and don't give me the
"need to know" foolishness!

19:01.384 --> 19:03.019
You're on my base, Mr. Lassen.

19:03.085 --> 19:04.719
I have lives
I'm responsible for.

19:04.786 --> 19:06.088
And I need to know if
that thing

19:06.155 --> 19:08.224
is gonna jeopardize
our situation.

19:08.290 --> 19:09.824
Have you heard of CRISPR?

19:09.892 --> 19:12.161
Yeah. Gene Editing Compound,
alters and disrupts DNA.

19:12.228 --> 19:13.728
Correct.

19:13.795 --> 19:15.164
However, this particular CRISPR
was used by

19:15.231 --> 19:16.465
the Russian government
to engineer a deadly

19:16.531 --> 19:18.167
airborne pathogen.

19:18.234 --> 19:20.302
They have plans to distribute it
to terrorist organizations

19:20.369 --> 19:21.904
and place it into countries

19:21.971 --> 19:24.206
that were struggling
to obtain democracy.

19:24.273 --> 19:27.410
The Russians will come in, offer
to quell any terrorist factions.

19:27.476 --> 19:29.644
Now the past few months
this has been around,

19:29.711 --> 19:31.280
we weren't able
to get our hands on it.

19:31.347 --> 19:32.814
We finally did that.

19:32.882 --> 19:35.985
Okay, explain
to me exactly how it works.

19:36.052 --> 19:39.121
A terrorist cell will place
this in a public place,

19:39.188 --> 19:42.024
probably a trash can
or a bus stop.

19:42.091 --> 19:43.858
Once the pathogen is unstable,

19:43.926 --> 19:46.128
it will cause rapid and
immediate thrombocytopenia

19:46.195 --> 19:48.630
in any organism
it comes into contact with.

19:48.696 --> 19:50.665
Okay, now what is
this thrombocytopenia...

19:50.732 --> 19:52.501
how'd you say it?

19:52.567 --> 19:54.904
It's a condition where the body
destroys its platelets.

19:54.970 --> 19:56.871
Massive internal
hemorrhaging occurs.

19:56.939 --> 19:58.773
Anyone exposed will
need to be treated in less

19:58.840 --> 20:00.476
than an hour before death.

20:00.543 --> 20:03.778
And you brought that here?
What is wrong with you?

20:03.845 --> 20:05.915
We didn't have much
of a choice, sir.

20:07.483 --> 20:09.919
We've already called another
EXFIL to come pick us up,

20:09.985 --> 20:13.855
get this to Kirkland
and get a vaccine.

20:13.923 --> 20:16.892
We have less than 13 hours
to do so.

20:19.828 --> 20:21.530
I don't know.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.631
These guys just showed up here
with a Valkyrie on the base.

20:23.698 --> 20:26.435
The whole place is on lockdown.

20:26.502 --> 20:30.306
I don't know... I don't know
what I'm going to be able to do.

20:30.372 --> 20:31.606
Who're you talking to?

20:34.043 --> 20:36.479
My sister.

20:36.545 --> 20:38.981
Letting them know I'm not
gonna be home for the holidays.

20:42.351 --> 20:44.320
Hey, look, I have to call
you guys back.

20:46.688 --> 20:48.190
Tell Mom I love her.

20:49.492 --> 20:51.026
You, too.

20:54.330 --> 20:57.199
You know,

20:57.266 --> 20:59.801
I think this is gonna
my mom's last Thanksgiving.

21:01.270 --> 21:03.372
You know what they're
saying, right?

21:03.439 --> 21:06.942
Yes, I do, but that's not what
that phone call was about.

21:35.504 --> 21:38.240
<i>We were just buzzed
by one Russian bogey.</i>

21:38.307 --> 21:40.209
<i>Cease all further
radio transmission.</i>

21:40.276 --> 21:43.678
<i>I repeat, cease all radio
transmission at once.</i>

21:43.745 --> 21:45.680
By 4:00.
I'll be there.

21:45.747 --> 21:47.416
You don't believe in knocking?

21:47.483 --> 21:48.551
You said your cadets
weren't gonna be a problem.

21:48.617 --> 21:49.751
And?

21:49.817 --> 21:51.387
Now my dust off is compromised

21:51.453 --> 21:53.889
and we're losing time to
get the CRISPR to safety.

21:53.956 --> 21:55.357
I'm aware of that,
and I apologize.

21:55.424 --> 21:57.792
Apparently, one of 'em,
Lt. Barret,

21:57.859 --> 21:59.962
he called his sister stateside
that he has

22:00.029 --> 22:01.497
an emergency situation
and he wouldn't be home

22:01.564 --> 22:03.065
for the holiday.

22:03.132 --> 22:05.100
His mother's not
in good health...

22:05.167 --> 22:07.269
That was enough to send out
Russian scouts who have probably

22:07.336 --> 22:09.672
already figured out our
flight plan to this location.

22:09.737 --> 22:11.006
There's gonna
be more surveillance

22:11.073 --> 22:13.108
and possibly an
assault attack sent out.

22:13.175 --> 22:14.910
You need to get us
to the states now!

22:14.977 --> 22:17.112
The only aircraft we have
at this base are AT-38s

22:17.179 --> 22:19.481
and they don't have the
fuel to get you back.

22:19.548 --> 22:21.116
Mid-air refuel.

22:21.183 --> 22:22.384
All our seasoned pilots are
on leave for the holiday.

22:22.451 --> 22:23.851
This is a training base.

22:23.919 --> 22:26.422
None of my cadets know
how to do mid-air refuel.

22:26.488 --> 22:28.090
Get 'em all in here now.

22:28.157 --> 22:29.358
Now?

22:32.094 --> 22:33.229
Hold on.

22:33.295 --> 22:36.065
I need to see
the Sergeant right now.

22:36.932 --> 22:40.035
One, two!
One, two!

22:40.102 --> 22:43.339
One, two, one...

22:43.405 --> 22:44.839
Kelley.

22:49.777 --> 22:51.614
Yes, sir. Understood.

22:51.680 --> 22:52.982
On your feet!

22:56.518 --> 22:58.853
Mr. Barret, do you understand
the meaning of "off the books"?

22:58.921 --> 23:01.257
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Apparently not!

23:01.323 --> 23:02.824
Because a short while ago,
you placed a cellphone call

23:02.891 --> 23:04.260
to your sister stateside
declaring we had

23:04.326 --> 23:06.128
an emergency situation
here in Asan!

23:06.195 --> 23:08.364
Sir, that is all I said, sir!

23:10.232 --> 23:12.268
Let's move! We have a briefing
in the C.O.'s office.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.216
Mr. Lassen.

23:27.283 --> 23:28.917
We have a package that
needs to be delivered

23:28.984 --> 23:30.719
to Kirkland Air Base
in the United States

23:30.785 --> 23:32.288
within the next 12 hours.

23:32.354 --> 23:34.223
It's absolutely essential
there be no further

23:34.290 --> 23:37.226
personal communication
outside of the desert.

23:37.293 --> 23:38.994
There's a better than
average chance

23:39.061 --> 23:41.230
we'll be subjected to
further reconnaissance.

23:41.297 --> 23:42.531
Sir?

23:42.598 --> 23:44.066
Second Lieutenant Alex Marcus.

23:44.133 --> 23:46.335
I'd like to volunteer our
squad for air defense.

23:46.402 --> 23:48.203
Kid, you have no idea
what's coming for us.

23:48.270 --> 23:49.871
No, sir, I guess I don't.

23:49.938 --> 23:52.141
Most likely, Russian military.

23:52.207 --> 23:55.244
A trio of green,
untested Air Force cadets

23:55.311 --> 23:57.079
lacking surface to air support

23:57.146 --> 23:59.415
is hardly a match
for Russian U47s.

23:59.481 --> 24:02.017
Yes, your only option is
to run this mission, sir.

24:05.354 --> 24:06.955
You may get that chance,
Lieutenant.

24:07.022 --> 24:09.625
Second Lieutenant Spielman, sir.

24:09.692 --> 24:11.894
Second Lieutenant Brown, sir.

24:11.960 --> 24:14.196
If the Russian military
attacks this base,

24:14.263 --> 24:16.231
is that not considered
an act of war?

24:16.298 --> 24:18.467
Unfortunately, in the court
of international law,

24:18.534 --> 24:21.103
our actions to date would be
considered terrorism.

24:23.172 --> 24:24.773
- Great.
- Joy.

24:24.839 --> 24:28.143
And Colonel Herring could be
regarded as harboring fugitives.

24:30.479 --> 24:32.114
Here's how I would
like to proceed

24:32.181 --> 24:33.482
with your permission, sir.

24:33.549 --> 24:35.451
Let's hear it.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.686
I don't mind the idea
of having three pilots

24:37.753 --> 24:39.955
available for the FA-18 Hornets.

24:40.022 --> 24:42.191
If you have anybody
available to repair

24:42.257 --> 24:45.294
our aircraft, I would
appreciate that.

24:45.361 --> 24:48.497
Master Sergeant Kelley,
Mr. Oliver, Mr. Rapp and myself

24:48.564 --> 24:51.734
will give a refresher
on basic infantry skills.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.002
Master Sergeant, can we
get some weapons, please?

24:54.069 --> 24:55.170
We can, sir.

24:55.237 --> 24:56.672
Need I remind you, Mr. Lassen,

24:56.739 --> 24:58.841
these kids are fresh
out of Air Force Academy.

24:58.907 --> 25:00.509
They've never put
a bullet in anyone.

25:00.576 --> 25:02.411
Everybody's gotta
start somewhere.

25:08.984 --> 25:09.952
Good stance, Lieutenant.

25:10.018 --> 25:11.387
Thank you, sir.

25:13.155 --> 25:15.791
Elbows tucked in and down!

25:15.858 --> 25:17.393
Hold that rifle
like you mean it!

25:17.459 --> 25:19.361
Got it.
Thank you, ma'am.

25:19.428 --> 25:21.530
Keep it up, keep it up.
Right there. Right there.

25:21.597 --> 25:23.532
Pull it tight.

25:23.599 --> 25:25.968
Elbows tucked in and down.

25:26.034 --> 25:27.636
Hold that rifle
like you mean it!

25:27.703 --> 25:29.138
Widen your stance.

25:29.204 --> 25:30.372
Your feet should be
under your shoulders.

25:30.439 --> 25:31.473
Yes, sir!

25:32.775 --> 25:34.109
Ah!

25:34.176 --> 25:35.444
How does it feel to have
a loaded rifle

25:35.511 --> 25:37.479
in your face even
though it is jammed?

25:37.546 --> 25:39.915
- Sorry.
- You made your point.

25:42.184 --> 25:44.186
If you all can't think
clearly right now

25:44.253 --> 25:45.754
when you're not being shot at,

25:45.821 --> 25:48.892
how are you gonna perform
when you are being shot at?

25:48.957 --> 25:50.759
I understand you're pilots.

25:50.826 --> 25:54.163
The saying that goes for up
here goes for down here.

25:54.229 --> 25:57.332
Keep your head
in the game at all times.

26:02.204 --> 26:03.505
Still got a little time left.

26:03.572 --> 26:05.941
Mr. Oliver, assist
them for another 30.

26:06.008 --> 26:09.144
I'm gonna get a SITREP and
find out where our EXFIL is.

26:09.211 --> 26:11.613
All right,
let's keep going, guys.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.556
Who's the best pilot
out of that group?

26:22.357 --> 26:23.258
Marcus.

26:23.325 --> 26:25.394
He's cocky, but talented.

26:25.461 --> 26:27.663
I'm not opposed to Marcus's
idea of providing

26:27.729 --> 26:31.600
some sort of diversion as an
attack using the FA-18 Hornets.

26:31.667 --> 26:33.268
Well, Lieutenant Barret,

26:33.335 --> 26:35.170
who I know isn't on the top
of your list presently,

26:35.237 --> 26:37.739
is a fine mechanic as well.

26:37.806 --> 26:40.108
Okay, put Barret
on our aircraft.

26:40.175 --> 26:42.177
Hey, earlier in that briefing,

26:42.244 --> 26:44.813
you said there was a chance
of an assault on our base.

26:44.881 --> 26:46.748
Yes?

26:46.815 --> 26:47.749
How likely is that?

27:19.348 --> 27:21.717
Jamie, you all right?

27:26.221 --> 27:27.723
There's something
I need to tell you.

27:36.331 --> 27:38.300
I put in for reassignment.

27:43.272 --> 27:44.473
Reassignment?

27:45.774 --> 27:47.309
To who, where?

27:50.512 --> 27:54.816
Just here, but just as support.

27:57.085 --> 27:59.087
I'm not cut out to fly.

27:59.154 --> 28:00.556
What makes you say that?

28:00.622 --> 28:01.723
You.

28:03.292 --> 28:04.793
Alex, Kathryn.

28:07.362 --> 28:10.799
You know, in handling
that gun today

28:10.866 --> 28:14.336
it just made me realize that,
if it came to it,

28:14.403 --> 28:17.439
I couldn't shoot
an enemy plane down.

28:17.506 --> 28:19.474
Well, at least you don't have
to shoot your enemy in the face.

28:22.210 --> 28:23.579
That's supposed
to make me feel better?

28:24.914 --> 28:26.815
I didn't mean it like that.

28:26.883 --> 28:29.718
I'm just...
I'm trying to help.

28:29.785 --> 28:31.186
Yeah, I know.

28:31.253 --> 28:33.022
God, that was such a stupid
thing to say.

28:33.088 --> 28:35.424
It's fine.
It's fine.

28:37.092 --> 28:38.093
I'm sorry.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.861
It's fine.

28:39.929 --> 28:42.798
Colonel Herring and Lassen want
me to try and fix that Valkyrie.

28:44.366 --> 28:47.235
So I'm gonna give that
a try, at least.

28:50.006 --> 28:51.206
Good.

28:52.909 --> 28:53.842
Good, I'm glad.

28:55.143 --> 28:56.612
Fix that futuristic
jet of theirs

28:56.678 --> 28:57.880
and get 'em to hell
outta here, right?

29:10.225 --> 29:12.494
I don't like these guys.

29:12.561 --> 29:14.763
Everything we've heard about
Black Ops, they reek of it.

29:14.830 --> 29:17.132
You saw how that one put
his gun in Barret's face?

29:17.199 --> 29:19.434
Who do these people
think they are?

29:19.501 --> 29:22.905
Who knows what
they are or were.

29:22.972 --> 29:25.041
They all have that look.

29:25.108 --> 29:26.575
We don't know what they've seen.

29:31.647 --> 29:33.415
You see the good
in everyone, huh?

29:34.917 --> 29:36.551
It's just not our place.

29:38.153 --> 29:42.557
When my brother first got back
from Afghanistan, he...

29:46.561 --> 29:48.064
I know.

29:48.131 --> 29:50.165
Hey, but we're not them, right?

29:50.232 --> 29:52.367
Lights out in 10!

29:52.434 --> 29:54.169
Get some rest.

30:10.086 --> 30:12.721
Master Kelly forget our P.T.?

30:57.133 --> 30:58.500
Get up now!

30:58.567 --> 31:00.602
We just had
hostiles doing a flyover!

31:00.669 --> 31:01.938
I want you, Brown, and Spielman
ready for flight

31:02.004 --> 31:04.372
before they come back!

31:04.439 --> 31:05.741
Looks like you got your wish.

31:07.375 --> 31:08.543
Barret, with me. Move!

31:10.812 --> 31:13.248
Oliver. I want you
to rig an M152 RAMS

31:13.315 --> 31:15.151
to that building structure.

31:15.218 --> 31:16.119
Yes, sir.

31:16.185 --> 31:17.753
Worse cast scenario,

31:17.819 --> 31:19.421
Russians blindside us
and take over the base.

31:19.488 --> 31:22.158
Explosives will be rigged
to any structures

31:22.225 --> 31:23.825
containing classified intel.

31:23.893 --> 31:25.727
Oliver will carry
a remote detonator.

31:25.794 --> 31:28.864
We lose control of the base,
hit the detonator.

31:28.931 --> 31:30.632
Why we rigging the tents?

31:30.699 --> 31:33.002
If this package falls
in the wrong hands again,

31:33.069 --> 31:34.469
we're all expendable.

31:34.536 --> 31:36.271
Can't argue with that point.

31:36.338 --> 31:38.007
I'd liked to have been briefed
on the topic a little earlier.

31:38.074 --> 31:39.708
Well, I'm to blame
for that Master Sergeant.

31:39.775 --> 31:41.077
I failed to inform you
of that detail.

31:41.144 --> 31:44.247
Understood, sir.
My apologies.

31:44.312 --> 31:47.216
Rapp, I want you to find the
best vantage points possible.

31:47.282 --> 31:49.618
Copy that.

31:49.684 --> 31:51.553
- Where do you want me, sir?
- With me.

31:51.620 --> 31:54.090
Colonel Herring, do you have
a safe bunker to go to?

31:54.157 --> 31:55.724
I'm stayin' with you.

31:57.026 --> 31:58.627
We have confirmed visual.

31:58.693 --> 32:00.796
Four Russian MI-20 attack
helicopters headin' this way.

32:00.862 --> 32:02.831
They're flying below 4,000 feet.

32:02.899 --> 32:04.466
That's why they aren't
registering on radar.

32:04.533 --> 32:06.701
This is a full recon, okay?

32:06.768 --> 32:08.503
Ground forces
are not far behind.

32:08.570 --> 32:09.939
They're gonna try
to take out our defenses

32:10.006 --> 32:11.207
and our communication.

32:11.274 --> 32:13.642
Roger that.
We're ready, sir.

32:19.148 --> 32:21.117
Everybody, take your positions.

32:21.184 --> 32:22.851
Eyes to the skies!

32:40.535 --> 32:41.870
Dutch? Sparrow?
Radio check!

32:44.106 --> 32:45.473
<i>Sparrow. Copy.</i>

32:45.540 --> 32:46.842
<i>Dutch here.</i>

33:15.137 --> 33:16.738
All right.
Let's get ready to go.

33:18.107 --> 33:19.741
Here goes nothing.

33:19.808 --> 33:23.045
Come on! That's not the fightin'
spirit, Sparrow.

33:23.112 --> 33:25.447
- I'm good.
- That's more like it.

33:25.513 --> 33:27.382
Yeah, that's what I thought.

33:27.449 --> 33:28.717
All right, all systems are go.

33:30.485 --> 33:32.587
All right, guys,
this one's for real.

33:35.157 --> 33:38.593
Okay, folks, now that we're
at our cruising altitude

33:38.660 --> 33:42.031
of 10,000 feet,
let's drop it down to 5,000,

33:42.098 --> 33:43.366
see if we can get eyes on.

33:43.431 --> 33:46.035
Copy that.
Descending to Eagles 5.

33:46.102 --> 33:47.502
Copy.

33:59.916 --> 34:04.586
Bogeys at 3:00 low, 2,000 feet,
heading east at 260 knots!

34:04.653 --> 34:07.455
No joy, Sparrow, no joy.

34:07.522 --> 34:09.225
Got a visual on four bogeys.

34:09.292 --> 34:11.659
Dutch, Sparrow, drop to 3,500.

34:11.726 --> 34:14.897
I'm gonna take to 3,000 and see
if I an shake 'em up a bit.

34:19.168 --> 34:21.170
Whoa! Wait!
Are you trying to draw fire?

34:21.237 --> 34:23.239
They fire at us,
we fire at them.

34:23.306 --> 34:26.574
We can already shoot.
This is international air space.

34:26.641 --> 34:29.210
Okay, everyone.
Adjust your altitude now.

34:33.049 --> 34:34.581
Cowboy?

34:34.649 --> 34:37.851
And here we go.

34:52.168 --> 34:55.170
Woo!
Got their attention now, baby!

34:55.237 --> 34:56.804
Nice, Cowboy!

34:56.871 --> 34:59.507
<i>All right, let's see
if our new friends bite.</i>

34:59.574 --> 35:02.711
Reducing speed to 300 knots.

35:02.777 --> 35:04.512
Let's give those Archers
a chance to heat up.

35:04.579 --> 35:06.215
<i>Copy.</i>

35:14.789 --> 35:17.927
They're on my ass, guys!
Please buzz them now!

35:17.994 --> 35:18.961
On it.

35:31.440 --> 35:32.607
Hey, guys, they're on my ass!

35:44.086 --> 35:46.688
Guys, I'm flying blind here!
Where are you?

35:51.494 --> 35:53.029
Hard left... now!

35:59.567 --> 36:01.636
Got a hit!
Two bogeys down!

36:04.907 --> 36:06.308
There's a lock on me!

36:12.814 --> 36:14.917
Dutch, break left, and flares!

36:19.388 --> 36:21.123
Oh, damn it!

36:21.190 --> 36:22.324
Guys, I'm out.

36:23.426 --> 36:24.592
Heading back to the barn.

36:24.659 --> 36:27.029
Copy that, Dutch!
Get outta here!

36:28.330 --> 36:31.100
Coming around on their six
for another pass.

36:34.403 --> 36:35.971
All right.
I got a lock.

36:38.606 --> 36:40.176
Firing now.

36:47.950 --> 36:50.785
Sparrow, what are you doing?

36:50.852 --> 36:53.255
Sparrow, do you copy?
What are you doing?

36:54.856 --> 36:57.692
Sparrow, slow down!
You're goin' too fast!

36:57.759 --> 36:59.761
Sparrow, you need to roll now!

37:14.143 --> 37:17.645
<i>Nice shot, Sparrow, nice shot!</i>

37:18.514 --> 37:19.949
We did it!

37:23.185 --> 37:24.686
We did...

37:24.752 --> 37:26.821
but please don't give me
a heart attack like that again.

37:38.766 --> 37:40.236
Spielman.

37:42.104 --> 37:43.272
Brown.

37:43.339 --> 37:44.639
Marcus.

37:47.742 --> 37:49.278
Impressive work up there,
Lieutenants.

37:49.345 --> 37:52.348
Thank you, sir.
We learned from the best.

37:52.414 --> 37:54.649
Colonel Herring, sir!

37:54.716 --> 37:55.750
FA-18s one and two
are both grounded

37:55.817 --> 37:57.586
with structural damage, sir.

37:57.652 --> 38:00.122
Lieutenant Barret, let's get
you on Mr. Lassen's jet.

38:00.189 --> 38:02.525
See if those repairs are
within our capabilities.

38:02.591 --> 38:04.326
All right.
I can do that, sir.

38:04.393 --> 38:06.395
Already visual confirmation of
another enemy aircraft...

38:06.462 --> 38:08.696
- No.
- An SU-57.

38:12.635 --> 38:14.203
Colonel, with all due respect,

38:14.270 --> 38:15.638
if we don't go and bring
it to them right now,

38:15.703 --> 38:17.306
they're gonna bring it to us.

38:21.709 --> 38:23.279
Then let's move.

38:29.919 --> 38:31.753
Looks like we're gonna
have to rely on visuals.

38:31.819 --> 38:34.689
That SU-57's equipment is state
of the art stealth technology,

38:34.756 --> 38:37.993
radar absorbent materials,
serrated edge panels, the works.

38:38.060 --> 38:39.727
I heard they actually have
beyond visual range missiles.

38:39.794 --> 38:41.463
Well, you heard correct,
my friend.

38:41.530 --> 38:42.965
All right, boys, knock it off.

38:43.032 --> 38:44.533
Copy that, Sparrow.

38:47.036 --> 38:48.971
Guys, I have a lock on me!

38:53.142 --> 38:54.709
No joy.

38:54.776 --> 38:56.145
Dutch, I don't see him!

38:56.212 --> 39:00.182
It's those BVRs, man.
I'm telling you!

39:00.249 --> 39:02.551
Dutch, you need
to recalibrate.

39:02.618 --> 39:04.119
Cross-check your
instrumentation!

39:04.186 --> 39:05.888
Guys, they're still
locked on me!

39:12.027 --> 39:14.163
Break right, Dutch.
Now! Break right!

39:19.368 --> 39:21.836
The SU-57 is
still locked on me!

39:25.807 --> 39:27.343
Shit! I'm hit!

39:27.409 --> 39:28.776
Dutch, you need to eject!

39:30.946 --> 39:32.615
I'm hit, I'm hit!

39:32.681 --> 39:35.584
You need to eject!
Right now!

39:35.651 --> 39:36.885
Eject, Dutch!

39:39.588 --> 39:41.056
Okay, Sparrow, drop to 3,000.

39:41.123 --> 39:42.958
We need to see if we can
ball up his grid.

39:43.025 --> 39:45.261
I'm gonna stay up here at five,
to see if I can get a visual.

39:46.562 --> 39:48.497
Come on.
Where is this guy?

39:49.797 --> 39:51.133
There he is!

39:55.738 --> 39:59.742
Sparrow, watch out!

39:59.807 --> 40:01.510
Shit!
He's messing with us!

40:05.881 --> 40:07.283
We can't outmaneuver this guy.

40:09.518 --> 40:10.953
Cowboy, respond!

40:13.555 --> 40:14.490
Gotcha.

40:15.857 --> 40:17.159
Firing now!

40:23.499 --> 40:24.433
Damn!

40:25.833 --> 40:27.636
We need to abort,
Head back to the barn.

40:27.703 --> 40:30.205
I don't care what international
laws that it violated.

40:30.272 --> 40:32.074
We're not equipped
to deal with this.

40:32.141 --> 40:33.808
We need real help.

40:33.876 --> 40:36.111
No. I got an idea.

40:36.178 --> 40:37.680
We're going to run a
continuous scissor pattern.

40:37.746 --> 40:39.515
We're gonna force him
to lock onto one of us.

40:39.581 --> 40:42.618
When he does, the other
one drops off and gets on six.

40:42.685 --> 40:44.353
Copy, Cowboy.

40:44.420 --> 40:47.456
All right.
Let's give it a shot.

41:00.536 --> 41:01.904
He's locked on!

41:01.970 --> 41:03.639
You need to keeping moving!

41:03.706 --> 41:05.174
Pull up and break left!

41:07.609 --> 41:08.544
I can't shake him!

41:10.179 --> 41:12.681
When I give you the word,
I want you to go full vertical.

41:12.748 --> 41:13.982
What?

41:14.049 --> 41:16.185
Trust me, Sparrow.
We need to do this.

41:18.087 --> 41:19.421
I'll stall out!

41:19.488 --> 41:21.156
No, you need to do it, okay?
Just do it.

41:21.223 --> 41:22.758
On my word.
Are you ready?

41:22.825 --> 41:24.159
Yeah.

41:26.895 --> 41:28.430
Now! Do it!
Pull up!

42:04.032 --> 42:05.501
What happened?

42:06.935 --> 42:08.704
Had to eject.

42:08.771 --> 42:09.872
The plane?

42:09.938 --> 42:11.974
We were no match for that SU-57.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.842
I don't know what
we were thinking.

42:13.909 --> 42:15.411
Marcus and Brown?

42:16.812 --> 42:18.180
I don't know.

42:21.483 --> 42:22.451
Shit.

42:22.518 --> 42:23.986
What?

42:28.257 --> 42:30.058
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

42:44.406 --> 42:47.976
So two planes are grounded
and three are complete losses.

42:48.043 --> 42:51.380
We have one left,
without a weapons system.

42:51.447 --> 42:53.048
- Sorry, sir.
- Don't be sorry.

42:53.115 --> 42:54.650
If you hadn't stopped
that Su-57,

42:54.716 --> 42:56.018
it would have surely
destroyed all our aircraft

42:56.084 --> 42:58.754
and Mr. Lassen's jet.

42:58.821 --> 43:02.391
We have to break radio silence
and put out a distress call.

43:02.458 --> 43:04.059
- Can't do that.
- Why?

43:04.126 --> 43:05.561
Right now, it's just a skirmish.

43:05.627 --> 43:07.596
You send out your fleet,
they send out theirs.

43:07.663 --> 43:10.332
Now we're at war,
one that no one's gonna win.

43:10.399 --> 43:12.000
I don't understand.

43:12.067 --> 43:14.169
A skirmish?
This is an act of war.

43:14.236 --> 43:15.370
They're trying to attack us!

43:15.437 --> 43:16.772
This desert?

43:16.839 --> 43:19.641
Is it official U.S. territory
or is it on a trial run?

43:21.810 --> 43:23.045
It's on loan.

43:25.447 --> 43:27.082
I don't mean to
be disrespectful,

43:27.149 --> 43:28.952
but this type of shit
happens all the time,

43:29.017 --> 43:30.786
stuff that you guys will
never hear about.

43:30.853 --> 43:33.322
This particular procedure,
it goes beyond the knowledge

43:33.388 --> 43:35.925
of any national agency,
even the president.

43:35.991 --> 43:37.192
Plausible deniability.

43:37.259 --> 43:38.594
Yes, exactly.

43:38.660 --> 43:40.462
It's just us.

43:40.529 --> 43:42.664
So the faster you guys realize
that, the better off we'll be.

43:44.399 --> 43:46.368
So what's the plan?

43:46.435 --> 43:48.270
We're losing time.

43:48.337 --> 43:51.507
They'll be back with bigger
and better weaponry.

43:51.573 --> 43:52.808
Maybe take the CRISPR
in the woods

43:52.876 --> 43:54.343
and wait for the EXFIL there.

43:54.409 --> 43:56.980
Sir? I don't like it.

43:57.045 --> 43:58.380
I don't like it either,

43:58.447 --> 44:01.583
but sometimes we need
to just get going.

44:01.650 --> 44:03.118
Why not just secure
the CRISPR here?

44:03.185 --> 44:05.187
This package does
not leave my sight

44:05.254 --> 44:07.322
unless you have
some type of vault.

44:07.389 --> 44:08.624
No, sir.

44:08.690 --> 44:10.927
You three were really
good with M-16s.

44:10.994 --> 44:13.362
I'm gonna need your skills
rather than staying here.

44:13.428 --> 44:15.464
Kelley, I want you
to accompany us.

44:15.531 --> 44:17.866
We're gonna go into
the woods with the CRISPR

44:17.934 --> 44:19.635
and wait for the EXFIL there.

44:19.701 --> 44:22.604
We're gonna protect the CRISPR
at all costs, understand?

44:24.172 --> 44:25.574
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

44:25.641 --> 44:28.110
So pack whatever you can
for the next 12 hours.

44:33.048 --> 44:34.449
Barret?

44:34.516 --> 44:35.617
Yes, sir?

44:35.684 --> 44:37.553
How work going with
Mr. Lassen's jet?

44:37.619 --> 44:39.555
It's good.

44:39.621 --> 44:41.790
I identified the problem
and I'm gonna fix it.

44:44.726 --> 44:46.328
Excellent news.

44:46.395 --> 44:48.363
You will continue to work
on Mr. Lassen's jet.

44:48.430 --> 44:51.533
Should you need to
make radio contact...

44:51.600 --> 44:52.634
Yes, sir?

44:52.701 --> 44:55.038
Use your standard
encrypted call sign.

44:55.103 --> 44:57.506
- Understood, sir.
- Good deal.

45:01.843 --> 45:03.111
I need to go.

45:04.212 --> 45:06.983
All right.

45:07.050 --> 45:08.918
They're coming back.

45:08.985 --> 45:11.320
And when they do, you need
to find a place to hold out.

45:13.422 --> 45:14.690
I'm coming back for you, okay?

45:16.758 --> 45:17.693
All right.

45:28.704 --> 45:30.172
Hey...

45:45.955 --> 45:47.322
Pardon me, sir.

45:48.190 --> 45:49.725
With all due respect, Sir,

45:49.791 --> 45:51.894
don't you think it's best
that you stay behind?

45:51.961 --> 45:53.762
That's the plan, Mr. Lassen.

45:53.829 --> 45:56.565
I'm gonna remain at the base
and oversee Barret's work.

45:56.632 --> 45:59.401
But advise your men this
is high altitude desert.

45:59.468 --> 46:01.336
You could be trudging
through several feet of snow

46:01.403 --> 46:03.372
on your way to
a secure location.

46:03.438 --> 46:05.240
Why not just stay
at the base

46:05.307 --> 46:07.376
instead of freezing
our asses off?

46:07.442 --> 46:09.544
Lower visibility out here.

46:09.611 --> 46:11.480
At the base, anyone can spot us.

46:11.546 --> 46:15.150
If the EXFIL's going to happen,
this is the best place to do it.

46:15.217 --> 46:16.652
Just feels like the
increased exposure

46:16.718 --> 46:18.520
is gonna make us
more vulnerable.

46:18.587 --> 46:20.756
How do we know they're
not out here already?

46:20.822 --> 46:24.860
We don't, but at least
we can buy Barret more time

46:24.927 --> 46:26.728
to make the Valkyrie repairs.

46:26.795 --> 46:29.498
It's our only option if
the EXFIL falls through.

46:29.564 --> 46:32.234
Still don't like having
to freeze my ass off.

47:10.572 --> 47:11.873
Take deep breaths, guys.

47:12.975 --> 47:14.509
Breathe.

47:14.576 --> 47:17.546
So do you guys know what this
thing is or let me guess?

47:17.612 --> 47:19.148
You're not gonna tell is.

47:19.214 --> 47:21.283
It's a lethal viral agent.

47:21.349 --> 47:22.952
It's airborne.

47:23.019 --> 47:24.586
That sounds serious.

47:24.653 --> 47:26.989
It is, if we don't get
it back to the lab in time

47:27.056 --> 47:28.790
for them to develop a vaccine.

47:28.857 --> 47:32.461
Hey, whatever you need from us,
just let us know, okay?

47:38.968 --> 47:40.469
Looks like a good spot up there.

47:44.806 --> 47:47.743
The higher vantage will help us
see if we're being followed.

48:51.673 --> 48:53.375
Okay, let's drop here.

48:53.441 --> 48:56.478
This is the highest ground and
the best cover we're gonna find.

49:04.853 --> 49:06.755
I hope you shoot
better than you fly.

49:06.822 --> 49:08.057
Yeah, me too.

49:09.791 --> 49:11.560
Brown, make sure to watch
his back, please.

49:13.795 --> 49:16.765
No matter what happens, we watch
each other's backs, okay?

49:16.832 --> 49:18.000
Okay.

49:20.702 --> 49:22.004
Colonel Herring?

49:22.071 --> 49:23.471
Lassen. Do you copy?

49:23.538 --> 49:25.107
<i>Loud and clear.
What's your SITREP?</i>

49:25.174 --> 49:26.675
We've established
a secure perimeter

49:26.741 --> 49:28.410
and we're hunkered down.

49:28.476 --> 49:30.079
But we can't hold
this position for long.

49:30.146 --> 49:31.479
What's the situation
on your end?

49:31.546 --> 49:33.216
How's the EXFIL looking?

49:33.282 --> 49:35.750
<i>I'm gonna need you to hold
on a little longer.</i>

49:35.817 --> 49:38.154
<i>My men are working diligently
on your aircraft.</i>

49:38.221 --> 49:41.023
<i>Hang in there.
We'll get you on your way.</i>

49:41.090 --> 49:43.125
We can't hold out here
much longer, Colonel.

49:43.192 --> 49:44.793
We're burning valuable
time out here.

49:44.860 --> 49:47.096
We need to get
the CRISPR off this island!

49:47.163 --> 49:48.931
<i>I understand that.</i>

49:48.998 --> 49:51.234
<i>We're doing everything we can
on our end to make that happen.</i>

49:51.300 --> 49:52.367
<i>Herring out.</i>

49:52.434 --> 49:53.702
Okay.

49:53.768 --> 49:55.503
Looks like we're clear for now.

49:55.570 --> 49:57.173
Master Sergeant, have you
started with the traps?

49:57.240 --> 49:58.506
No, sir, I haven't.

49:58.573 --> 50:00.042
This might be
a good time to do so.

50:00.109 --> 50:01.443
Yes, sir.

50:01.509 --> 50:03.112
Lieutenants!
You're with me!

50:03.179 --> 50:04.412
We're gonna set up
a defensive perimeter

50:04.479 --> 50:05.747
using good old Mother Nature.

50:05.814 --> 50:07.083
Let's go.

50:28.204 --> 50:29.571
That's right.

50:40.016 --> 50:41.783
Time to go.

50:51.994 --> 50:54.397
<i>Just had two MI-28s fly by.</i>

50:54.462 --> 50:57.266
<i>Sent Barret out to investigate.</i>

50:57.333 --> 50:58.600
<i>He will report.</i>

50:58.667 --> 51:01.037
Copy. Standing by.

51:01.103 --> 51:03.139
Hard to believe booby traps
are gonna make a dent

51:03.205 --> 51:05.207
in a platoon of an
elite Russian infantry.

51:05.274 --> 51:08.911
I think that's the point.
They won't be expecting it.

51:08.978 --> 51:10.812
Thought I heard a helicopter
flying over to the east.

51:10.880 --> 51:12.982
Wonder if they've sent
in reinforcements.

51:23.159 --> 51:27.029
Hard to be blind like this,
hidden behind all this cover.

51:27.096 --> 51:29.198
Not sure we'll be able
to handle more than 10,

51:29.265 --> 51:31.033
especially with
our little stick traps.

51:33.135 --> 51:35.404
They did this in
Vietnam, right, Sarge?

51:35.470 --> 51:36.805
That's right.

51:36.871 --> 51:39.208
My uncle stepped on
one of these in Da Nang,

51:39.275 --> 51:40.709
almost died from infection.

51:40.775 --> 51:42.711
They used to wipe shit
on the tips.

51:42.777 --> 51:44.246
- Say what?
- We're not doing that, are we?

51:44.313 --> 51:46.715
We're not savages,
Lieutenant Brown.

51:49.952 --> 51:51.753
Is this deep enough, Sarge?

51:53.122 --> 51:54.890
That's good.

51:54.957 --> 51:57.193
Lieutenant Brown,
keep these two alive, please.

51:57.259 --> 51:58.194
Yes, sir.

52:03.899 --> 52:04.934
You okay?

52:05.001 --> 52:06.435
Yeah.

52:06.501 --> 52:09.704
I'm just worried
about Jamie, though.

52:11.773 --> 52:12.942
I'm sure he's okay.

52:22.684 --> 52:23.886
Our north flank is open.

52:23.953 --> 52:25.820
We could use some
traps over there.

52:52.148 --> 52:54.917
We looking good?

52:54.984 --> 52:56.085
For now.

52:59.155 --> 53:02.058
So what were you before
whatever you are now?

53:03.526 --> 53:04.960
Force Recon.

53:06.561 --> 53:07.862
Marines.

53:07.930 --> 53:08.830
Whole team Devil Dogs?

53:08.898 --> 53:11.699
No, only a chosen few.

53:12.902 --> 53:15.037
My brother was in 5th Marines.

53:15.104 --> 53:17.339
Oh, yeah?
Where's he at now?

53:20.742 --> 53:22.278
He didn't come back
from Afghanistan.

53:23.711 --> 53:25.314
Tough break, soldier.

53:26.748 --> 53:27.983
It comes with the oath.

53:29.218 --> 53:32.121
That it does, soldier.
That it does...

54:21.103 --> 54:23.572
Echo, Bravo, Juliet One,
Authenticate.

54:23.638 --> 54:26.442
Victor, Romeo, Two.
Authenticating.

54:26.509 --> 54:29.078
Authentication confirmed.
What's your SITREP?

54:31.947 --> 54:33.182
Home base is compromised.

54:34.517 --> 54:35.817
I'm off base.

54:35.885 --> 54:36.986
<i>MI-28 returned and
Colonel Herring</i>

54:37.052 --> 54:38.888
<i>asked me to investigate.</i>

54:38.954 --> 54:40.956
<i>They dropped additional troops
and they're headed to base.</i>

54:42.258 --> 54:45.361
Unknown number.

54:45.427 --> 54:46.861
They're armed.

54:49.231 --> 54:51.133
<i>I count at least
eight of them.</i>

54:51.200 --> 54:52.368
Copy that.

54:52.434 --> 54:54.003
Sit tight and await
further instructions.

55:06.615 --> 55:08.617
How many?

55:08.683 --> 55:10.352
Eight lightly armed hostiles.

55:10.419 --> 55:13.022
They ain't out here
looking for us, though.

55:13.088 --> 55:14.456
Bring it.

55:16.358 --> 55:17.792
How's that doin'?

55:19.361 --> 55:20.429
Still here.

55:20.496 --> 55:21.997
How much time we got?

55:24.866 --> 55:26.302
Less than 10 hours.

55:30.372 --> 55:31.873
CRISPR?

55:31.941 --> 55:33.475
They haven't gotten it yet.

55:37.413 --> 55:39.248
Pile Driver? Storm.

55:40.616 --> 55:41.884
<i>Go ahead, Storm.</i>

55:41.951 --> 55:44.220
What's the ETA on that EXFIL?

55:44.286 --> 55:46.455
<i>Waiting for confirmation
of gun support.</i>

55:46.522 --> 55:49.258
<i>Your position
has been compromised.</i>

55:49.325 --> 55:51.627
But we're less than 10 hours
away from losing containment.

55:51.694 --> 55:53.861
<i>Copy that, Storm.
We're doing what we can.</i>

55:53.929 --> 55:55.331
<i>Will update and advise.
Out.</i>

56:01.403 --> 56:03.038
We have an armed patrol
heading this way!

56:03.105 --> 56:04.473
How many?

56:05.541 --> 56:06.508
Couldn't tell.

56:08.544 --> 56:10.579
All right. This is it.

56:10.646 --> 56:12.147
Basic Infantry skills.

56:12.214 --> 56:13.682
Keep your selector on "semi".

56:13.748 --> 56:15.517
Conserve your ammo.

56:15.584 --> 56:18.454
Nobody fires until they hit
the traps or I give the word.

56:18.520 --> 56:20.189
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

56:20.256 --> 56:21.357
Yes, sir.

56:41.744 --> 56:42.945
Visual.

56:44.846 --> 56:46.382
Five staggered
on the main trail.

56:49.551 --> 56:52.388
Three meters apart...
close grouping.

56:53.489 --> 56:54.856
All carrying AKs.

57:20.015 --> 57:21.583
Okay, let the first one
hit the punji stakes.

57:21.650 --> 57:23.485
Then take your shots.

57:23.552 --> 57:24.887
Copy that.

57:47.976 --> 57:49.912
Maintain a field of fire!

57:59.054 --> 58:00.456
Reloading!

58:04.360 --> 58:06.528
One, 3:00,

58:06.595 --> 58:08.197
two, 1:00.

58:08.263 --> 58:10.799
- I'll take 3:00.
- Copy that.

58:10.899 --> 58:12.134
Go, go!

58:22.077 --> 58:24.046
I got eyes on tripwire.

58:32.321 --> 58:34.356
They're flanking us
on the right!

58:38.627 --> 58:40.396
- Cover me!
- Covering!

58:42.631 --> 58:44.600
Let's go, let's go.

59:10.526 --> 59:11.827
We got 'em.

59:11.895 --> 59:13.028
Oh my God.

59:18.867 --> 59:20.536
It was either them or us.

59:24.106 --> 59:25.674
We gotta go!

59:36.685 --> 59:38.454
I'll come back.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.768
<i>Colonel Herring,
we've cleared the area</i>

01:00:26.835 --> 01:00:28.437
<i>and are circling back
to the base.</i>

01:00:28.504 --> 01:00:30.205
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:00:30.272 --> 01:00:31.406
<i>I'll link up with you
and the team</i>

01:00:31.473 --> 01:00:33.475
<i>when you reach the perimeter.</i>

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:35.611
<i>I've lost contact with Barret,
have you seen him?</i>

01:00:35.677 --> 01:00:36.745
Negative.

01:00:36.812 --> 01:00:37.981
<i>Any casualties?</i>

01:00:38.046 --> 01:00:39.883
Yes. One.

01:00:39.949 --> 01:00:41.316
Rapp.

01:01:12.015 --> 01:01:14.082
Jamie?

01:01:15.651 --> 01:01:17.219
What's he doing?

01:01:18.854 --> 01:01:21.123
Sergeant Barret!
I lost you!

01:01:21.189 --> 01:01:22.758
What's wrong?

01:01:22.824 --> 01:01:25.160
Where in the world did you go?

01:01:29.264 --> 01:01:31.433
I'm so sorry.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.335
Drop your weapons, gentlemen!

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:39.741
I have snipers in position.
Please, do as I have asked.

01:01:41.777 --> 01:01:46.515
I will ask you again,
please lower your weapons.

01:01:54.924 --> 01:01:59.595
I will ask you again.
Please lower your weapons.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.135
Okay. Put 'em down.

01:02:16.378 --> 01:02:18.780
Very good, very good.

01:02:18.847 --> 01:02:22.284
Now if you will all
kindly come this way,

01:02:22.351 --> 01:02:24.653
away from your weapons.

01:02:25.854 --> 01:02:26.855
Yes.

01:02:32.895 --> 01:02:34.296
Against wall.

01:02:38.166 --> 01:02:39.501
Good.

01:02:39.568 --> 01:02:44.873
You have something that is ours.

01:02:44.941 --> 01:02:46.475
We would like it back.

01:02:52.748 --> 01:02:54.516
On your knees!

01:03:03.026 --> 01:03:06.728
Please remember my snipers.

01:03:06.795 --> 01:03:08.630
Do not be a hero.

01:03:08.697 --> 01:03:10.732
- Marcus...
- On your knees.

01:03:38.326 --> 01:03:41.863
I sent five men.

01:03:43.532 --> 01:03:45.300
They're dead.

01:03:46.601 --> 01:03:51.506
You are... proficient.

01:03:52.474 --> 01:03:54.576
Is this the correct word?

01:03:54.643 --> 01:03:56.045
Thorough.

01:03:56.112 --> 01:03:58.413
Thorough, thorough.

01:03:59.982 --> 01:04:03.351
I... I am proficient.

01:04:57.773 --> 01:04:59.976
No talking!

01:05:00.042 --> 01:05:01.510
Do not move!

01:05:45.288 --> 01:05:47.789
He's gone.

01:05:51.459 --> 01:05:54.997
<i>It's gonna be some time before
any jet could reach your area.</i>

01:05:55.064 --> 01:05:57.033
<i>We do recommend that
if the Valkyrie</i>

01:05:57.099 --> 01:05:59.601
<i>is in flying condition that
your pilot should take it</i>

01:05:59.668 --> 01:06:01.536
<i>and see if they can
secure the package.</i>

01:06:01.603 --> 01:06:04.439
<i>Again, take the Valkyrie
and secure the package.</i>

01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:13.748
Looks like visuals are
made by the screens

01:06:13.815 --> 01:06:16.986
fed through some sort of
360 camera system.

01:06:17.053 --> 01:06:18.921
She's all yours.

01:06:18.988 --> 01:06:22.490
I... I don't know if
I can do this.

01:06:22.557 --> 01:06:23.758
No time to debate.

01:06:23.825 --> 01:06:25.928
I think these are
weapons stations.

01:06:30.933 --> 01:06:31.934
Alex.

01:06:32.001 --> 01:06:33.835
If anyone can do this,
it's you.

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:36.838
All right.

01:06:36.906 --> 01:06:38.506
Well, it can't be that
difficult, right?

01:06:38.573 --> 01:06:40.542
Uh, instrumentation's the same,

01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:44.446
give or take a
few gadgets and...

01:06:48.416 --> 01:06:50.552
We got it! Okay!

01:06:50.619 --> 01:06:52.387
All right, right?

01:06:52.454 --> 01:06:54.257
Okay.

01:06:54.323 --> 01:06:56.192
G.A.T.
What do you think that is?

01:06:56.259 --> 01:06:58.526
Gatling gun?

01:06:58.593 --> 01:07:00.795
Oh, no, I just did something.

01:07:00.862 --> 01:07:02.731
Yes! That's what it is!

01:07:02.797 --> 01:07:04.100
- All right.
- That's awesome!

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.609
All right, guys.
Prepare for take off.

01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:16.544
All right, here we go.

01:07:16.611 --> 01:07:17.746
- Ready.
- Ready, Dutch?

01:07:17.812 --> 01:07:19.215
- Oh my God.
- Here we go.

01:07:19.282 --> 01:07:20.415
Let's do this.

01:07:20.482 --> 01:07:24.387
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.

01:07:24.452 --> 01:07:26.088
Okay, all right.

01:07:26.155 --> 01:07:31.493
Here we go, slowly, and
let's pull up now slowly...

01:07:32.995 --> 01:07:34.230
And there we go!

01:07:42.171 --> 01:07:44.106
<i>Cadets, this is
Colonel Herring.</i>

01:07:44.173 --> 01:07:45.607
<i>I've requested backup
from home.</i>

01:07:45.674 --> 01:07:47.310
<i>They're a long way out,</i>

01:07:47.376 --> 01:07:49.378
<i>so it's unlikely they
will reach you in time.</i>

01:07:49.444 --> 01:07:51.147
<i>If you're able to take
possession of the CRISPR,</i>

01:07:51.213 --> 01:07:54.083
<i>you are to proceed to
Kirkland Air Force Base.</i>

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:55.084
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:07:55.151 --> 01:07:56.484
<i>Copy that, sir.</i>

01:08:00.222 --> 01:08:02.490
We got it, okay.

01:08:02.557 --> 01:08:03.926
Woo!

01:08:04.826 --> 01:08:06.929
Amazing. We're up.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.801
Enemy in sight, guys!

01:08:12.867 --> 01:08:15.870
Incoming 200 knots.

01:08:15.938 --> 01:08:18.740
Intercepting course
in about 20 miles.

01:08:20.376 --> 01:08:23.578
There's a weapons panel here,
a missile panel.

01:08:23.645 --> 01:08:26.448
We have air to air
missiles, guys!

01:08:26.514 --> 01:08:28.750
Good, we got enemies in sight.

01:08:33.822 --> 01:08:36.425
Here's the plan, guys.

01:08:36.491 --> 01:08:39.794
We're gonna bank left,
cut across their bow.

01:08:39.861 --> 01:08:43.899
All right, Spielman, I need
you on that Gatling gun.

01:08:43.966 --> 01:08:45.935
We only have one chance at this.

01:08:46.002 --> 01:08:48.938
If we destroy that chopper,
we lose the CRISPR. Copy?

01:08:49.005 --> 01:08:50.339
- I understand.
- Okay

01:08:50.406 --> 01:08:53.274
All right. Here we go.

01:08:54.477 --> 01:08:56.045
Banking left now.

01:09:04.853 --> 01:09:07.990
And take your shot!

01:09:24.073 --> 01:09:26.142
This plane's got
great horizontal speed,

01:09:26.207 --> 01:09:28.310
but the stick is like
moving through mud.

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:31.779
We got two S-80s incoming!

01:09:31.845 --> 01:09:32.846
Hold on! Pulling up!

01:09:32.915 --> 01:09:35.550
Pull up now! Let's go.

01:09:44.926 --> 01:09:46.162
That's way closer
than I want it.

01:09:46.228 --> 01:09:47.828
Damn it.
Shit.

01:09:47.897 --> 01:09:50.598
Oh... Guys, any idea on
how we can cripple this guy

01:09:50.665 --> 01:09:52.700
without destroying him?

01:09:52.767 --> 01:09:54.537
Maybe I can lock on
to its rear rudder

01:09:54.602 --> 01:09:56.238
with one of these
air to air missiles.

01:09:56.305 --> 01:09:58.307
No, Dutch. You and I both
know we can't do that.

01:09:58.374 --> 01:10:01.377
That's a serious crash right
there we're talking.

01:10:01.444 --> 01:10:02.912
So what do we do?

01:10:11.786 --> 01:10:13.456
We're coming up on a field!

01:10:13.522 --> 01:10:16.058
We'll shoot out his rudder,
force him to land there!

01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:17.759
Let me think.

01:10:17.826 --> 01:10:20.829
Whatever we end up doing,
the timing has gotta be perfect.

01:10:20.896 --> 01:10:22.331
It's risky.

01:10:22.398 --> 01:10:24.300
All right, Dutch.
I need you on that gun.

01:10:24.366 --> 01:10:26.168
We need to set
the chopper down, all right?

01:10:26.235 --> 01:10:27.602
We only have one chance!

01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:28.603
You ready?

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:31.440
Ready.

01:10:31.507 --> 01:10:33.309
Coming around his six again...

01:10:33.375 --> 01:10:34.809
and...

01:10:39.415 --> 01:10:40.648
Banking left now!

01:10:53.429 --> 01:10:55.197
Come on, come on!

01:10:58.334 --> 01:11:01.370
- Got it! Woo!
- Good shot, Dutch!

01:11:01.437 --> 01:11:03.506
Yeah!

01:11:03.572 --> 01:11:06.075
Good shot, Dutch!
Good shot.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:09.445
Wait, wait, wait.

01:11:09.512 --> 01:11:11.779
No, no, no, no!

01:11:11.846 --> 01:11:13.648
He's headed to the trees!
Come on, man.

01:11:17.486 --> 01:11:18.720
No, no, no, no.

01:11:18.786 --> 01:11:20.489
Pull up, man. Pull up!

01:11:20.556 --> 01:11:22.191
Damn it, Spielman, we only
wanted to take his rudder out,

01:11:22.258 --> 01:11:23.359
not make him crash!

01:11:23.425 --> 01:11:25.127
No! I know!

01:11:28.597 --> 01:11:30.166
Pull up!

01:11:30.232 --> 01:11:32.001
Pull up! Pull up!

01:11:33.302 --> 01:11:35.104
Damn it!

01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:38.440
I'm sorry, Alex.

01:11:40.609 --> 01:11:41.911
Wait, wait!

01:11:41.977 --> 01:11:43.212
No, no, no, look!
He's running!

01:11:45.948 --> 01:11:49.684
- There he is.
- How'd he survive that?

01:11:49.751 --> 01:11:53.088
Alex, take her down.

01:11:53.155 --> 01:11:54.890
I'm goin' after the CRISPR.

01:11:54.957 --> 01:11:56.691
Are you sure about this?

01:11:58.894 --> 01:12:00.262
Time to Cowboy up, right?

01:12:01.796 --> 01:12:04.600
Copy that.

01:12:04.667 --> 01:12:07.570
Let's get ready
to take her down.

01:12:07.636 --> 01:12:09.338
Let's take her down.

01:12:10.606 --> 01:12:11.806
Hold tight!

01:12:11.873 --> 01:12:13.142
All right, guys.

01:12:13.209 --> 01:12:15.444
It's gonna be a
bumpy one, okay?

01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:17.479
- All right.
- Hang on!

01:12:22.685 --> 01:12:25.654
Nice and slow, hold on.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.256
Nice and slow.

01:12:27.323 --> 01:12:29.058
All right.
It's gonna be a rough landing.

01:12:29.124 --> 01:12:32.827
Touchdown in three, two, one.

01:12:38.901 --> 01:12:40.569
We'll have the Valkyrie
ready to go.

01:12:40.636 --> 01:12:42.770
Based on the way
he's moving on the monitor,

01:12:42.837 --> 01:12:43.973
he looks pretty banged up.

01:12:44.039 --> 01:12:45.773
This one's yours, Spielman.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:48.110
But if you're not back in 10,
we're coming after you.

01:14:52.434 --> 01:14:54.903
Oh! Oh!

01:16:27.129 --> 01:16:29.832
<i>Valkyrie ATC,
what is your status?</i>

01:16:29.899 --> 01:16:31.867
- Do you copy?
- <i>We do copy.</i>

01:16:31.935 --> 01:16:33.502
We have the CRISPR, one injured.

01:16:33.569 --> 01:16:35.471
<i>Copy. We understand
you have the CRISPR.</i>

01:16:35.537 --> 01:16:36.972
<i>Please proceed to
Kirkland Air Force Base.</i>

01:16:37.039 --> 01:16:39.374
<i>Copy.
Kirkland Air Force Base.</i>

01:17:42.271 --> 01:17:43.772
Looks good.

01:17:49.012 --> 01:17:49.946
Well done.

01:17:50.013 --> 01:17:51.280
Everything looks intact.

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:57.921
Thanks, guys. We'll get you
briefed and back to Asan.

01:17:57.987 --> 01:17:59.821
Who says I'm going back to Asan?

01:18:02.591 --> 01:18:05.661
How are we gonna protect
America without you?

01:18:05.727 --> 01:18:08.463
Could we we technically say
that we saved the whole world?

01:18:12.267 --> 01:18:14.770
You've done your country
a great service.

01:18:14.836 --> 01:18:16.338
Saved a lot of lives.

01:18:20.877 --> 01:18:22.277
And lost a lot of them, too.

01:18:24.279 --> 01:18:26.181
We have them to thank.

01:18:28.784 --> 01:18:31.386
I've trained a lot
of pilots in my career,

01:18:31.453 --> 01:18:33.488
some good, some real good.

01:18:33.555 --> 01:18:36.792
And then a few that
are truly exceptional.

01:18:36.858 --> 01:18:39.561
To be an exceptional pilot,
much like being

01:18:39.628 --> 01:18:42.798
in Special Forces, sometimes you
need to think outside the box.

01:18:42.864 --> 01:18:46.168
You need to be a rebel,
but not a mutineer.

01:18:46.234 --> 01:18:48.704
Sometimes the answer lies
right in front of you.

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:51.607
Other times, you need
to search deep for it.

01:18:51.673 --> 01:18:55.677
In combat, it is easy
to lose your cool.

01:18:55.744 --> 01:18:58.246
But those who can keep
a cool head and stay calm

01:18:58.313 --> 01:19:00.917
are the ones who've
proved to be leaders,

01:19:00.984 --> 01:19:06.089
leaders that we so desperately
need in these desperate times,

01:19:06.154 --> 01:19:08.857
those capable of
heroic acts of courage

01:19:08.925 --> 01:19:10.626
not only to protect
one's country,

01:19:10.692 --> 01:19:12.694
but be willing
to lay down their life

01:19:12.761 --> 01:19:15.364
for that of their
fellow servicemen.

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:18.467
Most pilots like Marcus,
Brown and Spielman will never be

01:19:18.533 --> 01:19:20.435
called upon and
do what those great pilots

01:19:20.502 --> 01:19:24.573
have done: to actually
engage in ground warfare.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.242
It's another thing
entirely to look your enemy

01:19:27.309 --> 01:19:30.579
in the eye to see the
life drain from them.

01:19:30.646 --> 01:19:33.749
That's one advantage
to being a pilot.

01:19:33.815 --> 01:19:36.284
But even still,
the knowledge of your actions

01:19:36.351 --> 01:19:38.553
can still lay heavy
on your conscience,

01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:40.555
if you don't keep
the mission and the reason

01:19:40.622 --> 01:19:42.591
at the forefront
of your thoughts.

01:19:42.658 --> 01:19:45.327
Lieutenants Marcus, Brown
and Spielman will have long,

01:19:45.394 --> 01:19:48.764
successful careers ahead of them
for as long as they wish.

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:51.233
It's a chance to forge
pilots like these

01:19:51.299 --> 01:19:54.403
that drives me to continue on.

01:19:54.469 --> 01:19:56.571
Their actions enabled Lassen
and his team

01:19:56.638 --> 01:19:58.807
to get the CRISPR to where
it needed to go.

01:19:58.874 --> 01:20:02.644
It's been reported that the
operation proved successful.

01:20:02.711 --> 01:20:05.647
Even at my rank, you don't
always get the full story.

01:20:05.714 --> 01:20:07.950
Sometimes you just get
"mission accomplished"

01:20:08.017 --> 01:20:09.919
and that's all you can ask for.

01:20:09.986 --> 01:20:12.854
I often wonder what
would have happened

01:20:12.922 --> 01:20:16.725
had Lassen and his men landed
in another training base.

01:20:16.792 --> 01:20:20.629
But, luckily,
they landed in mine.
