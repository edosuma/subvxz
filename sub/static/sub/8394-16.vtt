WEBVTT

00:01.170 --> 00:02.478
- THE HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET?

00:02.580 --> 00:04.207
WHEN WERE YOU
GONNA TELL ME THIS?

00:04.310 --> 00:05.538
- WE DON'T HAVE TO RUN ANYTHING
BY YOU OR ANYONE ELSE.

00:05.660 --> 00:07.036
- WHERE DO YOU PUT A KID
WHO DOESN'T BELONG ANYWHERE?

00:07.140 --> 00:08.107
- AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

00:08.210 --> 00:09.279
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A SCHOOL
FOR HIM

00:09.380 --> 00:10.415
IS IF WE START ONE OURSELVES.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.930
- YOU WANTED
THIS FREE-SPIRITED THING,

00:12.040 --> 00:13.348
AND I JUST NEED RULES.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.178
- MAYBE WE SHOULD BE
JUST FRIENDS.

00:15.290 --> 00:16.905
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HE WOULD LEAVE ME.

00:17.010 --> 00:18.978
- I WANT TO GO HOME.
IT'S NOT FAIR.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.731
- IT'S SO QUIET IN HERE.
IT JUST--

00:21.840 --> 00:23.876
IT FEELS EMPTY.
IT SOUNDS EMPTY.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.629
- SO IT'S KIND OF TURNING
INTO SOMETHING?

00:25.740 --> 00:26.672
- WITH CARL?
NO.

00:26.780 --> 00:27.815
- I MAY BE FALLING FOR YOU.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.809
[both giggling]

00:42.690 --> 00:43.759
- I'M GOING TO AFRICA.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.895
- [laughs]

00:46.010 --> 00:47.864
A SIMPLE "I GOT TO GO"
WILL DO.

00:47.970 --> 00:50.074
- [laughing]
NO.

00:50.180 --> 00:54.116
NO, I'VE GOT TO GO
FOR WORK TO ZIMBABWE FOR A WEEK.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.289
- OH, MY GOD.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.494
- I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO
WITHOUT YOU.

00:58.610 --> 01:01.056
I'D BE SAD.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.081
COME WITH ME.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.986
- I STILL WAIT

01:04.090 --> 01:07.093
FOR THE DOOR TO CLOSE

01:07.200 --> 01:09.339
- WHAT?

01:10.690 --> 01:12.783
- COME WITH ME.
COME WITH ME TO AFRICA.

01:12.900 --> 01:15.789
- WHEN YOU GO

01:15.900 --> 01:18.585
I DON'T KNOW

01:18.690 --> 01:20.169
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.008
REALLY, REALLY.
YEAH.

01:21.110 --> 01:23.078
- I CAN'T GO.
I HAVE WORK.

01:23.180 --> 01:24.169
- YOU CAN.
- I HAVE A DEADLINE.

01:24.290 --> 01:26.975
I HAVE A SURFSPORT
IMPORTANT DEADLINE.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.799
- OH, STOP IT
WITH THE SURFSPORT DEADLINE.

01:29.910 --> 01:32.538
GET--PEOPLE GET EXTENSIONS
FOR THOSE THINGS, RIGHT?

01:32.640 --> 01:35.461
I MEAN, DOES ANYBODY
REALLY MAKE DEADLINES ANYMORE?

01:35.570 --> 01:37.629
IT'S SO '705.

01:37.750 --> 01:40.366
[laughs]

01:40.470 --> 01:43.678
COME WITH ME.
YOU WILL FEEL SO INSPIRED THERE.

01:43.790 --> 01:47.544
YOU'LL PHOTOGRAPH THINGS
YOU NEVER DREAMED OF.

01:49.310 --> 01:53.030
- NIGHTS TURNED SLOW

01:53.140 --> 01:55.449
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

01:55.560 --> 01:57.448
- YEAH.

01:57.560 --> 01:58.595
OKAY.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.974
- [chuckles]

02:00.080 --> 02:01.695
OKAY.

02:07.540 --> 02:10.395
- YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO
TEAR DOWN THE SHED, OF COURSE.

02:10.500 --> 02:11.364
- IT'S NOT A SHED.
IT'S A BARN.

02:11.470 --> 02:14.405
- OH, IT MAKES
THE HOUSE LOOK OLD.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.954
LOOK, LI'I'I'LE CHANGES
LIKE THESE--

02:16.060 --> 02:17.618
HOUSE IS GONNA FLY
OFF THE MARKET.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.688
- I THINK SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

02:19.790 --> 02:20.927
- I NEED YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:21.030 --> 02:22.372
- I HATE THIS KAREN LADY.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.959
HER BLUETOOTH
AND THAT CLIPBOARD.

02:24.070 --> 02:26.231
FELT BOOTS.
I MEAN, SHE'S THE WORST.

02:26.350 --> 02:28.375
- OH, GOD, COME ON.
STAY OUT OF IT, COME ON.

02:28.490 --> 02:29.969
- LOOK AT HER, "YOU GOTTA DO
THIS AND THIS AND OTHER THINGS."

02:30.080 --> 02:32.173
- OKAY, YOU ARE DEFINITELY
GONNA WANT

02:32.290 --> 02:33.621
TO REFINISH THESE FLOORS.

02:33.730 --> 02:35.072
IF IT IS THE ONE THING
THAT YOU DO,

02:35.180 --> 02:37.068
THE LIST PRICE
WILL GO UP BY 10%.

02:37.190 --> 02:38.942
PEOPLE LOVE FLOORS.

02:39.050 --> 02:39.971
HEY, GUYS.
- HI.

02:40.090 --> 02:41.398
- OH, HEY, KARE.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.569
- HEY.

02:42.670 --> 02:43.841
WE'RE JUST GOING
THROUGH OUR PUNCH LIST.

02:43.950 --> 02:46.919
WE ARE GONNA GET YOUR PARENTS'
HOUSE READY TO SELL.

02:47.020 --> 02:48.669
- I COULD REDO THE FLOORS,
YOU KNOW?

02:48.780 --> 02:49.917
- NO, YOU COULDN'T--I THINK THEY
NEED TO BE DONE PROFESSIONALLY.

02:50.030 --> 02:52.544
- YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO DO THEM
PROFESSIONALLY.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.299
GUYS, COME ON.
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

02:54.410 --> 02:57.129
WE'RE GONNA DE-CLU'I'I'ER
THESE BEDROOMS.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.446
- DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT?

02:58.550 --> 03:00.893
"WE'RE GONNA DE-CLUTTER
THESE BEDROOMS"?

03:01.000 --> 03:03.628
OH, I'M SURE THAT THE CRIB
IS CLU'ITERING UP THE BEDROOM.

03:03.730 --> 03:05.652
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET RID OF THAT.
MAYBE EVEN THE KIDS.

03:05.770 --> 03:06.520
THOSE ARE REAL CLU'I'I'ER.
- YOU REALLY NEED TO DROP THIS.

03:06.630 --> 03:08.382
YOU SOUND REALLY CRAZY
RIGHT NOW.

03:08.490 --> 03:09.457
- DID YOU SEE MY FATHER?

03:09.560 --> 03:10.902
DID YOU SEE THE LOOK
ON HIS FACE?

03:11.010 --> 03:12.523
THEY'RE RUNNING OVER HIM.
- WE'RE GUESTS IN THEIR HOUSE.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.665
- HE'S LIKE A BOBBLEHEAD,
"YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER YOU SAY."

03:14.780 --> 03:15.735
THAT'S NOT EVEN MY DAD

03:15.850 --> 03:17.181
THAT WAS WALKING
BEHIND THOSE TWO CRAZY WOMEN.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.359
- LOOK, IF YOU BU'I'I' IN,
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THINGS

03:19.470 --> 03:21.085
MORE AWKWARD THAN IT ALREADY IS,
ALL RIGHT?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.019
I'M SLEEP-DEPRIVED,
I'M BREAST-FEEDING,

03:22.130 --> 03:24.052
AND I'M LIVING
WITH MY IN-LAWS,

03:24.160 --> 03:27.857
SO PLEASE,

03:27.960 --> 03:30.929
- FINE.

03:31.030 --> 03:32.964

I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT
WITH YOU.

03:58.060 --> 04:00.437
- OKAY.

04:00.550 --> 04:02.575
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW

WE'RE GONNA TALK
ABOUT VEGETABLES AND RECYCLING

04:08.100 --> 04:10.409
AND OUR CRAPPY GARDEN,

04:10.520 --> 04:13.967
AND I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT
MY PERSONAL STUFF WITH YOU.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.594
I CAN'T BE ACTUAL FRIENDS
WITH YOU.

04:20.080 --> 04:23.015
- GOT IT.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.873
- ALL RIGHT.

04:25.980 --> 04:28.119
I JUST DROPPED 200 BUCKS
ON VEGETABLE PLANTS

04:28.230 --> 04:30.369
AT THE GARDEN CENTER, SO...

04:30.470 --> 04:31.289

04:40.030 --> 04:42.476
LET'S JUST GET THIS DONE.

04:42.590 --> 04:44.239
- GOD, THIS IS A DISASTER.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.796

04:46.900 --> 04:48.242
[knock on door]

04:48.350 --> 04:50.284

08:38.690 --> 08:40.305
- WE'LL CALL WITH THE RESULTS
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

08:40.410 --> 08:41.786
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SAY

08:41.900 --> 08:44.232
THAT YOU ARE ONE YEAR
CANCER-FREE.

08:44.350 --> 08:45.442
YOU CAN GET DRESSED NOW,
KRISTINA.

08:45.550 --> 08:48.485
[door closes]

08:48.590 --> 08:51.798
- JUST A COUPLE DAYS.

08:51.910 --> 08:53.901
- YEAH.

08:54.010 --> 08:57.355
A COUPLE DAYS.

08:57.460 --> 09:00.020
- WELCOME TO GREEN WEEK

09:00.120 --> 09:01.394
AND TO YOUR GARDEN.
- YEAH, WHOO!

09:01.500 --> 09:02.876
- LOOK AT THIS!

09:02.990 --> 09:04.434
ALL THOSE TEENY, TINY,
LITTLE SEEDS THAT YOU PLANTED

09:04.540 --> 09:08.362
ARE BIG, BEAUTIFUL,
TASTY VEGETABLES NOW.

09:08.470 --> 09:11.439
LOOK.
- WHERE DID THESE COME FORM?

09:11.550 --> 09:12.471
- THESE WEREN'T HERE YESTERDAY.
- WELL--

09:12.580 --> 09:14.719
- OH, THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR--

09:14.830 --> 09:16.513
THEY'VE BEEN GROWING
OVER THE LAST MONTH.

09:16.620 --> 09:17.541
THIS IS ALL--
THIS IS ALL YOUR STUFF.

09:17.660 --> 09:20.993
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S PLUCK SOME VEGETABLES.

09:21.110 --> 09:21.963
- LET'S DO IT.

09:22.070 --> 09:23.276
- WHERE DID THE CORN COME FROM,
DADDY?

09:23.390 --> 09:24.072
- WE PLUCKED IT YESTERDAY.

09:24.180 --> 09:24.794
- I DIDN'T SEE IT HERE
YESTERDAY.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.765
- WELL, IT WAS.
IT WAS.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.792
IT WAS JUST IN THE GROUND.
YOU DIDN'T SEE IT, GO OVER TO--

09:28.910 --> 09:31.140
- SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS,
WE'RE GETTING THE GREEN LEAVES

09:31.260 --> 09:32.488
OFF THE OUTSIDE AND THEN
ALL THE SILKY LITTLE GOLD BITS--

09:32.600 --> 09:35.251
GET THOSE OFF,
SO YOU DON'T HAVE HAIRY CORN.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.463
all: EWW.
- YEAH.

09:36.570 --> 09:39.607
- MOMMY, WE NEED TO TALK.
- OKAY, WHAT'S UP?

09:39.710 --> 09:41.530
- TOMORROW'S FUNKY PAJAMA DAY
AT SCHOOL,

09:41.650 --> 09:42.912
AND I WANT TO WEAR
MY JAMMIES

09:43.030 --> 09:43.598
WITH THE GREEN
AND PINK POLKA DOTS,

09:43.720 --> 09:46.029
BUT THEY'RE AT OUR HOUSE,

09:46.130 --> 09:48.189
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO SLEEP
AT DADDY'S TONIGHT.

09:48.310 --> 09:51.541
- OKAY, WELL, I WILL GO HOME
AND GRAB YOUR FUNKY PAJAMAS

09:51.660 --> 09:52.968
AND BRING THEM OVER TO DAD'S.

09:53.070 --> 09:53.729
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DROP THEM OFF.

09:53.830 --> 09:55.650
I WANT TO STAY AT OUR HOUSE.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.445
- OKAY, WELL, SWEETIE,
I GET THAT,

09:58.560 --> 10:00.346
BUT IT'S DAD'S NIGHT,
SO YOU GOT TO STAY OVER THERE.

10:00.460 --> 10:03.588
- I DON'T WANT TO STAY
AT DADDY'S STUPID APARTMENT.

10:03.700 --> 10:06.419
THE BEDROOM'S TOO SMALL,
AND IT SMELLS LIKE PAINT.

10:06.530 --> 10:09.112
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
- MY PAJAMAS ARE AT OUR HOUSE,

10:09.220 --> 10:10.391
AND I WANT TO SLEEP
WITH YOU TONIGHT.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.910
- SWEETIE, NO.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.669
WE HAVE A SCHEDULE,
AND TONIGHT IS DAD'S NIGHT,

10:13.780 --> 10:14.508
SO THAT'S THE WAY
IT HAS TO BE.

10:14.610 --> 10:17.056
- I WANT TO STAY WITH YOU.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.537
- PLEASE--PLEASE JUST SHUCK
SOME CORN, PLEASE.

10:19.650 --> 10:20.617
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.164
I WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU
TONIGHT!

10:22.270 --> 10:24.374
- OKAY, YOU CAN SLEEP WITH ME
TONIGHT.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.448
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

10:26.550 --> 10:30.134
THANK YOU.
- OKAY.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.172
THERE'S A WORM IN THE CORN.
- OH, NO.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.269
all: EWW.

10:33.390 --> 10:34.209
- THERE'S WORMS IN THE GROUND,

10:34.320 --> 10:35.901
AND THAT'S WHERE THIS STUFF
COMES FROM.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.625
IT'S ALL NATURAL,
AND IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

10:37.740 --> 10:38.968
- YOU'RE GROWING
YOUR OWN VEGETABLES,

10:39.080 --> 10:40.900
YOU GET SOME WORMS.
- YEP.

10:41.010 --> 10:42.739
- I DID A VERY GOOD JOB
ON THAT.

10:42.840 --> 10:43.943
- I TOOK THE PHOTO ON THAT ONE.

10:44.050 --> 10:45.039
- YOU DIDN'T TAKE THE PHOTO
ON THAT ONE.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.047
- I TOOK THE PHOTO.
I KNOW I DID.

10:46.160 --> 10:46.945
- I SET IT UP.
ALL YOU DID WAS CLICK.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.675
- YOU SET IT UP.
YOU DID SET IT UP.

10:48.780 --> 10:50.748
- "OH, MY FINGER. OW, IT HURTS."
CLICK.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.784
- IT'S MOSTLY THE EXECUTION.
THAT'S HOW IT IS.

10:52.890 --> 10:54.289
- I SEE. I UNDERSTAND.
- OKAY.

10:54.410 --> 10:56.685
- WELL, ANYWAY,
I LIKE IT.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.236
- ALL RIGHT.
I THINK THAT'S THE COVER.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.160
- I DO TOO.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.066
- I THINK
THEY'RE GONNA BE HAPPY.

11:03.170 --> 11:08.381
- HEY, SO I'M GONNA BE GONE
FOR JUST A WEEK NEXT WEEK,

11:08.490 --> 11:09.525
AND THEN I'LL BE
ON EMAIL--STUFF,

11:09.630 --> 11:12.349
BUT I'LL FINISH UP
WHEN I GET BACK.

11:12.460 --> 11:14.974
- I DON'T--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:15.080 --> 11:16.661
- I GOT A PERSONAL THING.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.772
- WELL, THIS--

11:18.880 --> 11:22.498
A WEEK FROM MONDAY
IS THE DEADLINE ON THIS.

11:22.610 --> 11:24.328
- I KNOW, WELL, WE MIGHT HAVE
TO MOVE THE DEADLINE

11:24.440 --> 11:25.748
JUST A FEW DAYS--
I'M SURE IT'LL BE FINE.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.023
- I DON'T--YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T MOVE DEADLINES.

11:28.130 --> 11:29.358
I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:29.480 --> 11:30.504
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU GOING TO THE CARIBBEAN?

11:30.620 --> 11:31.689
- I HAVE A PERSONAL MATTER.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

11:31.790 --> 11:35.305
I HEARD THAT,
BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

11:35.410 --> 11:37.514
- IT MEANS, HANK, THAT I DON'T
HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT I'M DOING,

11:37.620 --> 11:38.791
BECAUSE IT'S PERSONAL

11:38.900 --> 11:41.892
AND OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS PROFESSIONAL AND--

11:42.010 --> 11:42.556
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.697
- [scoffs]

11:45.800 --> 11:48.689
I'M GONNA CHECK SOMETHING
IN THE DARKROOM.

11:55.190 --> 11:57.397
- MOM,
WHERE'S THE LASAGNA LEFTOVERS?

11:57.500 --> 11:58.740
- WHAT, YOU MEAN
THAT LITTLE BIT?

11:58.850 --> 11:59.703
IT'S IN THE FREEZER.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.572
- OH, HELLO.

12:03.130 --> 12:06.304
- ADAM HAD A WORK MEETING,
SO I DECIDED TO COME HOME.

12:06.410 --> 12:09.163
WHAT ARE YOU PAINTING?
- THAT LITTLE BEDROOM UPSTAIRS.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.349
LILAC.

12:10.450 --> 12:11.200
- BY THAT LITTLE BEDROOM,

12:11.310 --> 12:12.129
YOU MEAN MY--
MY LITTLE BEDROOM?

12:12.240 --> 12:13.969
YOU'RE PAINTING IT LILAC?
- YEAH.

12:14.070 --> 12:16.550
- WHY WOULD YOU PAINT
MY BEDROOM LILAC?

12:16.660 --> 12:19.413
- BECAUSE IT'S A SOFT,
BEAUTIFUL COLOR.

12:19.530 --> 12:20.519
IT'S WARM AND INVITING.

12:20.630 --> 12:22.666
- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH KAREN

12:22.770 --> 12:24.738
TELLING YOU MAYBE
YOU SHOULD PAINT MY BEDROOM

12:24.840 --> 12:27.183
WITHOUT ASKING ME.

12:27.290 --> 12:28.564
- NO.
- NO?

12:28.670 --> 12:29.739
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.294
- NO.
I'M A PAINTER, REMEMBER?

12:31.400 --> 12:33.197
I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING
ABOUT COLOR.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.643
AND HASN'T BEEN YOUR BEDROOM
IN 15 YEARS.

12:35.750 --> 12:38.742
- OKAY, WELL,
BE THAT AS IT MAY,

12:38.860 --> 12:41.021
I GET A DISTINCT IMPRESSION

12:41.130 --> 12:42.995
THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW
BEING ORCHESTRATED

12:43.100 --> 12:44.920
BY THAT KAREN LADY,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

12:45.040 --> 12:46.792
"WE GOT TO GET THIS THING
IN TIP-TOP SHAPE

12:46.900 --> 12:48.447
SO WE CAN MOVE THIS UNIT,"
AND, YOU KNOW,

12:48.560 --> 12:50.209
"WHATEVER THE COST MAY BE,

12:50.320 --> 12:52.276
"I'M SURE MY FAMILY'S
AN INCONVENIENCE TO THAT PLAN.

12:52.390 --> 12:53.698
MAYBE I COULD GET THEM
OUT OF HERE."

12:53.800 --> 12:55.449
- OKAY, WELL,
NOW YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.288
- I'M NOT BEING RIDICULOUS.

12:56.390 --> 12:58.733
I DON'T WANT YOU
AND YOUR BUDDY KAREN

12:58.840 --> 12:59.738
TO STEAMROLL DAD.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.705
- WHAT?
IT'S A MUTUAL DECISION.

13:01.810 --> 13:04.324
- IT IS NOT MUTUAL.
I TALKED TO HIM.

13:04.430 --> 13:05.567
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SELL
THIS PLACE.

13:05.680 --> 13:07.887
YOU POSITIONED THIS,
SO IT'S A CHOICE

13:07.990 --> 13:09.469
BETWEEN YOU AND THE HOUSE.

13:09.580 --> 13:09.989
OF COURSE
HE'S GONNA PICK YOU.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.819
- YOU KNOW WHAT, CROSBY?

13:11.920 --> 13:13.808
THIS IS BETWEEN ME
AND YOUR FATHER,

13:13.930 --> 13:15.648
AND I JUST REALLY DON'T WANT
TO GET INTO IT WITH YOU.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.716
- OKAY, WELL, IF HE'S NOT
GONNA STICK UP FOR HIMSELF,

13:17.830 --> 13:19.343
THEN SOMEONE HAS TO.

13:19.450 --> 13:20.997
- YEAH, AND WHO'S GONNA
STAND UP FOR ME?

13:21.110 --> 13:22.236
NOBODY'S STANDING UP
FOR ME.

13:22.350 --> 13:23.510
- YOU DON'T NEED ANYONE
TO STAND UP FOR YOU.

13:23.630 --> 13:25.177
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S TRYING
TO SELL THIS HOUSE OUT

13:25.280 --> 13:26.201
FROM UNDER THE ENTIRE FAMILY.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.582
WE HAVE AN ATTACHMENT
TO THIS PLACE.

13:27.700 --> 13:30.521
IT'S VERY SELFISH.

13:33.910 --> 13:35.662
- SELFISH?

13:35.780 --> 13:39.671
- YES, I THINK
THIS ACTION IS SELFISH.

13:39.780 --> 13:44.080
- OKAY, LET ME PUT THIS
INTO SOME PERSPECTIVE FOR YOU.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.363
I SPENT OVER 30 YEARS
OF MY LIFE

13:47.480 --> 13:50.369
TAKING CARE OF FOUR KIDS,

13:50.480 --> 13:51.686
SOME OF WHOM ARE STILL LIVING
IN MY HOUSE

13:51.790 --> 13:54.782
AND COMING HOME FOR LUNCH,

13:54.900 --> 13:58.279
AND I SPENT
MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE

13:58.380 --> 14:02.658
COMPROMISING MYSELF
AND WHAT I WANT FOR YOUR FATHER.

14:02.770 --> 14:06.934
I'VE ALWAYS PUT MYSELF SECOND
OR THIRD

14:07.050 --> 14:09.803
OR FOURTH OR FIFTH
OR SIXTH.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.730
I'VE COOKED YOUR DINNERS.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.296
I HAVE PACKED YOU
SCHOOL LUNCHES.

14:14.400 --> 14:18.439
I HAVE DRIVEN YOU
TO PLAYDATES AND PRACTICE

14:18.540 --> 14:22.544
AND DONE YOUR LAUNDRY
WELL PAST WHEN I SHOULD HAVE,

14:22.650 --> 14:27.474
AND NOW WHEN I ASSERT ONE THING
THAT I WANT--

14:27.590 --> 14:28.852
ONE THING--

14:28.970 --> 14:32.201
YOU AND YOUR DAD
AND EVERYONE ELSE CAN'T TAKE IT.

14:32.310 --> 14:37.976
SO IF THAT'S SELFISH,
EXCUSE ME.

14:48.610 --> 14:50.669
- HONEY, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I'M GONNA BE MEAN.

14:50.780 --> 14:51.986
I'M GONNA BE
REALLY, REALLY MEAN.

14:52.090 --> 14:52.909
- WELL, REMEMBER,
THIS IS OUR SON'S TEACHER.

14:53.030 --> 14:54.224
MAX SEEMS TO LIKE THE GUY.

14:54.340 --> 14:55.295
- HE DOESN'T DESERVE
TO BE CALLED A TEACHER.

14:55.410 --> 14:56.957
HE'S LIKE A TROLL.
HE'S A WASTE OF SPACE.

14:57.060 --> 14:57.856
HE'S EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS COUNTRY,

14:57.960 --> 15:00.474
AND HE'S A WASTE
OF TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS.

15:00.580 --> 15:01.854
I'M JUST SICK AND TIRED
OF THIS STUFF HAPPENING.

15:01.970 --> 15:02.652
- OKAY, I THINK THIS IS IT.
YOU READY?

15:02.760 --> 15:03.681
YOU GOOD?
- GOOD.

15:03.790 --> 15:04.688
- YOU SURE?
- YEAH.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.825
- READY TO MEET THE TROLL?

15:06.940 --> 15:11.070
- OPEN THE TROLL DOOR.

15:11.180 --> 15:13.239
- MR. AND MRS. BRAVERMAN.
- YEAH.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.839
- ALL RIGHT, I'M MR. KNIGHT,
MAX'S ENGLISH TEACHER.

15:14.940 --> 15:15.759
COME IN.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.257
- COME ON.

15:21.810 --> 15:24.813
SO I'M ACTUALLY GETTING
MY PhD RIGHT NOW AT BERKELEY,

15:24.920 --> 15:26.672
AND ONE OF THE CRAZY,
FASCINATING THINGS

15:26.780 --> 15:30.568
THAT I'VE BEEN STUDYING
IS THAT SITTING IN CHAIRS

15:30.680 --> 15:32.568
IS A TOTALLY ANTIQUATED IDEA.

15:32.690 --> 15:34.783
I MEAN, KIDS LIKE MAX--
THEY LEARN BETTER,

15:34.890 --> 15:37.996
AND THEY'RE FAR MORE ENGAGED
WHEN THEY'RE UP, YOU KNOW?

15:38.100 --> 15:39.169
THEY'RE WALKING AROUND.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.554
THEY'RE INTERACT ING
WITH THE CLASS.

15:40.660 --> 15:41.684
I MEAN, OTHERWISE,
HALF THEIR ENERGY IS WASTED

15:41.800 --> 15:43.791
TRYING TO FORCE THEMSELVES
TO SIT STILL, YOU KNOW?

15:43.900 --> 15:45.788
- RIGHT, THAT MAKES SENSE.
- YEAH.

15:45.910 --> 15:48.049
I MEAN, I KNOW I DO BETTER
WHEN I'M UP.

15:48.150 --> 15:49.287
I CAN'T SIT STILL
FOR ANYTHING.

15:49.390 --> 15:50.618
I LIKE TO MOVE MY BODY,
YOU KNOW?

15:50.740 --> 15:53.709
- I LIKE TO MOVE MY BODY TOO.
- YES, YEAH.

15:53.810 --> 15:56.461
I MEAN, YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
THE PROGRESS THAT HE'S MADE

15:56.570 --> 15:57.946
IN ONE WEEK
SINCE I TOOK HIS CHAIR AWAY.

15:58.060 --> 15:59.322
- WOW.
- HMM.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.396
- THAT'S A BRILLIANT KID
YOU GOT THERE.

16:01.510 --> 16:04.058
- THANK YOU.
THAT IS SO NICE TO HEAR.

16:04.170 --> 16:07.719
THANKS.
- WELL, LOOK, I GET IT.

16:07.820 --> 16:10.539
THIS SCHOOL CAN BE
A TOUGH PLACE.

16:10.650 --> 16:13.062
HONESTLY, I WISH
THAT THERE WERE MORE SCHOOLS

16:13.170 --> 16:13.920
THAT CATERED TO KIDS LIKE MAX.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.964
I MEAN, HE'S SUCH A SMART KID--

16:17.070 --> 16:18.002
- IT'S SO CRAZY
THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT,

16:18.110 --> 16:20.146
BECAUSE WE WERE ACTUALLY
THINKING ABOUT--

16:20.250 --> 16:23.765
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLY
STARTING OUR OWN SCHOOL.

16:23.870 --> 16:25.314
- CHARTER SCHOOL.
- YEAH.

16:25.430 --> 16:26.351
- FOR THE IN-BETWEEN KIDS
LIKE MAX

16:26.460 --> 16:29.463
WHO, YOU KNOW, ARE GIFTED
AND DO WELL

16:29.570 --> 16:31.879
BUT NEED A LITTLE
EXTRA ATTENTION, LIKE YOU SAID.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.434
- COOL.
- SO...

16:33.540 --> 16:36.668
- WELL, THAT'S--
THAT'S GREAT, THAT'S GREAT.

16:36.780 --> 16:38.953
- YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU THINK THAT'S GREAT.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.925
- WELL, IT'S JUST
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE TOUGH.

16:41.030 --> 16:43.089
THERE'S A LOT OF RED TAPE.
- WE KNOW THAT.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.406
WE'RE NOT REALLY AFRAID
OF RED TAPE.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.408
I MEAN, WE'VE DEALT
WITH OTHER THINGS BEFORE, SO...

16:46.520 --> 16:48.920
- WELL, HONESTLY,
A LOT OF TIMES,

16:49.040 --> 16:49.995
THEY JUST DON'T LAST.

16:50.110 --> 16:50.758
PARENTS WILL START
A CHARTER SCHOOL

16:50.870 --> 16:51.962
FOR THEIR OWN KID.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.867
KID GRADUATES,
PARENTS LOSE INTEREST,

16:54.970 --> 16:56.528
AND THE SCHOOL FALLS APART.

16:56.630 --> 16:58.074
- WE WOULDN'T--
WE WOULDN'T DO THAT.

16:58.180 --> 17:00.489
- OF COURSE NOT.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT AT ALL.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.660
IT'S JUST
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

17:03.780 --> 17:08.080
IT'S GONNA BE A LOT HARDER
THAN YOU THINK.

17:11.850 --> 17:14.023
- HEY.
- HI.

17:14.130 --> 17:15.119
- IT'S MY DAY, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.686
- OKAY.
- JUST--IT'S GREEN WEEK, SO...

17:17.790 --> 17:18.609
- AH.
- I WAS HERE.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.859
- SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE.
- YEAH.

17:20.970 --> 17:22.062
SO I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

17:22.170 --> 17:23.410
SYDNEY WAS REALLY UPSET

17:23.520 --> 17:25.795
ABOUT SPENDING THE NIGHT
AT YOUR PLACE,

17:25.900 --> 17:28.937
SO I WAS WONDERING IF SHE COULD
STAY AT THE HOUSE TONIGHT,

17:29.040 --> 17:32.555
AND YOU GUYS COULD HAVE,
LIKE, A BOYS' NIGHT.

17:32.670 --> 17:33.898
- NO.
NO, THAT'S--

17:34.010 --> 17:36.490
THE THERAPIST SAID
THAT WAS, LIKE, THE--

17:36.600 --> 17:40.013
TH E--TH E--EXACT LY
THE WRONG THING TO DO RIGHT NOW.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.816
- YEAH, BUT SHE WAS THROWING
A TANTRUM

17:42.920 --> 17:45.229
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS

17:45.340 --> 17:48.093
AND, YOU KNOW, WANTED THESE
SPECIFIC PAJAMAS FOR TOMORROW,

17:48.200 --> 17:50.646
AND SHE DOESN'T SLEEP WELL
AT YOUR HOUSE, SO I--

17:50.750 --> 17:50.920
- YOU SAID YES?

17:51.030 --> 17:53.169
[sighs]

17:53.270 --> 17:54.851
JULIA, THAT'S--

17:54.970 --> 17:56.892
COME ON, THAT'S LIKE--

17:57.000 --> 17:59.889
THE THERAPIST TOLD US
WE HAVE TO SET UP A ROUTINE

18:00.000 --> 18:01.410
AND BE CONSISTENT
WITH THE SCHEDULE.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.930
THAT WAS, LIKE, THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.450
- I KNOW.
I WANT TO BE CONSISTENT.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.788
I REALLY--I DO,

18:05.910 --> 18:08.492
BUT SHE'S JUST--
I DON'T KNOW.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.215
YOU TRY TELLING HER NO
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS.

18:10.330 --> 18:11.706
- I TOLD HER NO
IN FRONT OF THE CLASS

18:11.810 --> 18:12.708
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

18:12.810 --> 18:13.777
IT'S NOT FUN,

18:13.880 --> 18:16.360
BUT IT'S BETTER
THAN THE OPPOSITE, YOU KNOW?

18:16.470 --> 18:17.983
IF WE DON'T STICK
TO WHAT WE'VE SET UP,

18:18.090 --> 18:19.125
WHAT WE'VE LAID OUT...

18:19.230 --> 18:20.845
- OKAY.
SORRY.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.848
- I'LL TELL HER
THAT SHE'S COMING HOME WITH ME,

18:22.960 --> 18:26.919
AND MAYBE YOU BETTER--

18:27.030 --> 18:30.921
MAYBE IT'S BETTER IF YOU GO,
SO SHE DOESN'T SEE YOU.

18:31.040 --> 18:35.556
AND YOU CAN DROP
THE PAJAMAS OFF LATER.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.629
- OKAY.

18:38.730 --> 18:40.595
I'LL SEE YOU LATER THEN.

18:40.700 --> 18:41.769
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.690
- OKAY.

18:43.810 --> 18:46.665
[somber music]

18:51.190 --> 18:54.159
- I'M COMING IN TOMORROW.

18:54.270 --> 18:55.532
- TOMORROW.
OKAY.

18:55.650 --> 18:57.129
- IT'S NOT MY DAY.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

18:57.230 --> 19:00.267
WELL, ASK YOUR PARENTS FIRST.
THEN YOU CAN COME.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.132
- SINCE AUNT SARAH'S GOING
TO AFRICA NEXT WEEK,

19:02.240 --> 19:06.108
CAN I HELP WORK ON
THE SURFSPORT PROJECT INSTEAD?

19:06.210 --> 19:07.791
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:07.900 --> 19:09.868
- AUNT SARAH'S GOING TO AFRICA
NEXT WEEK WITH HER BOYFRIEND,

19:09.970 --> 19:13.315
SO I WANTED TO WORK
ON THE SURFSPORT PROJECT.

19:16.770 --> 19:18.761
- MAX, WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

19:18.880 --> 19:20.529
- YOU'VE SAID
ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS

19:20.640 --> 19:22.084
THAT I HAVE A BETTER EYE
THAN AUNT SARAH.

19:22.190 --> 19:23.498
YOU SAID IT SEVEN TIMES.

19:23.610 --> 19:25.942
YOU ALSO SAID THAT SHE TALKS
TOO MUCH WHEN SHE WORKS,

19:26.060 --> 19:28.051
AND I RARELY TALK
WHEN I WORK.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.741
- PERSONAL BUSINESS, RIGHT?

19:29.850 --> 19:32.717
[chuckles]

19:32.820 --> 19:34.401
- CAN I WORK
ON THE SURFSPORT PROJECT?

19:34.510 --> 19:34.953
- YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:35.070 --> 19:36.992
- YES, OKAY.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.204
- WE'RE GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.198
LET'S PACK UP THIS STUFF.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.823
I'M GONNA CLOSE UP THE SHOP
EARLY TODAY.

19:42.940 --> 19:44.032
- WHY?

19:44.140 --> 19:46.791
- PERSONAL BUSINESS.
I GOT TO--

19:46.900 --> 19:48.458
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO?

19:48.560 --> 19:49.731
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
COME ON.

19:49.840 --> 19:50.829
I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.
YOU WANT TO DRIVE?

19:50.940 --> 19:52.350
YOU WANT TO WALK?
YOU WANT TO GET A YOGURT?

19:52.460 --> 19:53.449
I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE DOLLARS
TO GET A YOGURT.

19:53.570 --> 19:55.049
- I LIKE YELLOW M&MS
AS A TOPPING.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.014
- NATALIE, HEY.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.248
- WOW, YOU EMERGED.
- YEAH.

19:59.370 --> 20:01.429
YOU HEAR
ABOUT THE PARTY TONIGHT?

20:01.540 --> 20:03.189
- YEAH, I LIVE ON THIS CAMPUS.
I HEARD ABOUT THE PARTY TONIGHT.

20:03.300 --> 20:06.918
- OKAY, WELL, I WAS JUST
GONNA SEE IF YOU'RE GOING.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.998
- YOU WANT TO GO TO A FRAT PARTY
WITH ME?

20:13.100 --> 20:14.203
- YES, I KNOW
THAT IT'S WEIRD.

20:14.310 --> 20:15.993
MY SISTER AND I--
WE MADE THIS PLAN TO GO,

20:16.110 --> 20:18.931
SO I WAS GONNA SEE--

20:19.040 --> 20:21.247
- I-I DON'T GET YOU, DREW.
I DON'T.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.100
LIKE, AT FIRST, YOU'RE LIKE,
"I LIKE YOU.

20:22.220 --> 20:24.040
I WANT A RELATIONSHIP,"

20:24.150 --> 20:26.243
AND THEN
YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND COMES

20:26.360 --> 20:28.760
AND BASICALLY LIVES WITH YOU,
WHICH IS--

20:28.880 --> 20:29.778
- THAT WAS KIND OF A--
- THAT WAS REALLY WEIRD, MAN.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.632
- WELL, IT WAS
A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE.

20:31.740 --> 20:34.186
- AND THEN YOU DISAPPEAR
FOR, LIKE, THREE WEEKS.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.255
NOW YOU SUDDENLY EMERGE.

20:35.370 --> 20:37.531
YOU PRETEND LIKE NOTHING
EVER HAPPENED,

20:37.650 --> 20:39.504
AND YOU WANT TO TAKE ME
TO A FRAT PARTY,

20:39.610 --> 20:40.952
WHICH I'M PRETTY SURE
IS THE LAST PLACE

20:41.060 --> 20:42.049
YOU SAID YOU EVER WANTED
TO BE SEEN WITH ME, SO...

20:42.170 --> 20:43.990
- I KNOW--
- YEAH.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.853
NO.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.097
NO, I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO A FRAT PARTY WITH YOU.

20:48.210 --> 20:50.349
- OKAY.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.315
BECAUSE I SAID
I WANTED A RELATIONSHIP,

20:52.420 --> 20:53.648
YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO BE FRIENDS,

20:53.760 --> 20:57.696
WHICH IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.040
- RIGHT.

20:59.150 --> 21:01.254
I GOT TO GO.
I HAVE CLASS.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.873
- OKAY.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.917
- YOUR COWORKER
IS GOING TO AFRICA.

21:08.020 --> 21:08.748
THAT'S YOUR EMERGENCY.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.158
- YEAH, SHE'S GOING
WITH SOME GUY,

21:10.260 --> 21:11.636
SOME FRIEND, I GUESS.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.058
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.229
BUT SHE LIED.
THAT'S THE THING.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.740
SHE TOLD ME
IT WAS A PERSONAL MATTER.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.020
- WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
MAYBE IT IS.

21:18.130 --> 21:19.097
- NO, SHE LIED,

21:19.200 --> 21:20.132
BECAUSE SHE KNEW
THAT IT WAS B.S.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.401
AND THAT I WOULD CALL HER ON IT.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.727
- SO THIS WOMAN, SARAH,
SHE'S YOUR COWORKER.

21:24.830 --> 21:26.650
WORKING ON A PROJECT TOGETHER.
- YEAH.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.489
- AND THAT'S IT?
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.

21:28.590 --> 21:30.649
WE DATED ONCE.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT?

21:30.770 --> 21:32.214
- ONCE.
- YEAH, IT WAS A WHILE AGO.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.117
A YEAR--YEAR AGO ABOUT.

21:34.220 --> 21:36.359
NO BIG DEAL, THOUGH.
- UH-HUH.

21:36.460 --> 21:40.328
SO IT WASN'T SERIOUS.
- NO, NO, WASN'T SERIOUS.

21:40.430 --> 21:43.228
YOU KNOW, I MEAN--
I MEAN, I LOVED HER, BUT--

21:43.330 --> 21:45.605
SHE LOVED ME, I THINK.

21:45.710 --> 21:48.053
BUT ANYWAY, SO NOW WE'RE JUST--
IT'S TOTALLY PLATONIC.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.880
SHE'S MY COWORKER,

21:52.000 --> 21:53.228
MAYBE A FRIEND,

21:53.340 --> 21:54.989
THOUGH SHE'S REALLY ANNOYING.

21:55.100 --> 21:55.543
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

21:55.650 --> 21:58.585
IT'S ABOUT--
- WHAT?

21:58.690 --> 21:59.759
- I'M TRYING TO FIGURE
EVERYTHING OUT.

21:59.870 --> 22:02.134
YOU KNOW, LAST TIME,
YOU TOLD ME WHAT TO SAY,

22:02.250 --> 22:04.138
AND I DIDN'T DO THAT WELL.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.593
- SO IN YOUR OWN WORDS,

22:06.700 --> 22:12.184
ARE YOU ABLE TO TELL SARAH
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER?

22:12.290 --> 22:13.518
- I MEAN, I CAN TELL HER
HOW I FEEL.

22:13.640 --> 22:16.040
I JUST--I DON'T THINK
SHE'S GONNA LIKE IT.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.081
- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU'RE HONEST WITH HER.

22:17.190 --> 22:19.750
- YEAH, HONESTY.
THAT'S--

22:19.850 --> 22:21.363
HASN'T WORKED FOR ME
HISTORICALLY.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.335
- I KNOW, BUT YOU CAME TO ME

22:23.440 --> 22:28.639
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO CHANGE,
DIDN'T YOU?

22:28.760 --> 22:29.852
- YEAH.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.269
- SOMETIMES EVEN IF
IT'S NOT COMFORTABLE,

22:32.380 --> 22:37.795
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT LEAP.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.140
- YEAH.

22:39.250 --> 22:42.071
[knock on door]

22:42.180 --> 22:44.523
- HI.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:44.630 --> 22:46.188
- UM, WELL, I TRIED TO TALK
TO YOU AT THE SCHOOL,

22:46.290 --> 22:48.736
BUT YOU DIDN'T REALLY LET ME.

22:48.850 --> 22:50.283
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.528
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT I KNOW

22:53.640 --> 22:55.016
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
RIGHT NOW,

22:55.130 --> 22:56.574
AND I'M SORRY,

22:56.680 --> 22:59.365
AND IT'S REALLY HARD,

22:59.480 --> 23:01.095
ESPECIALLY
THE FIRST FEW WEEKS,

23:01.200 --> 23:02.542
AND IF YOU NEED ANYTHING
AT ALL--

23:02.650 --> 23:05.585
- SERIOUSLY?
- WHAT?

23:05.690 --> 23:06.964
- YOU'RE--YOU'RE SERIOUSLY--

23:07.070 --> 23:10.107
YOU'RE COMING HERE AT NIGHT
TO MY HOUSE

23:10.210 --> 23:11.416
TO SEE
IF I NEED ANYTHING,

23:11.520 --> 23:13.249
TO SAY
THAT YOU'RE SORRY?

23:13.350 --> 23:16.103
- YEAH.

23:16.220 --> 23:19.940
- DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT THIS IS YOUR FAULT?

23:20.050 --> 23:21.256
- UH, NOT REALLY.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.214
- YOU'RE THE REASON JOEL LEFT.

23:23.330 --> 23:26.709
I TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED,
AND HE LEFT,

23:26.810 --> 23:29.119
AND NOW WE'RE SHUTTLING OUR KIDS
BACK AND FORTH

23:29.230 --> 23:30.982
WITH THESE LITTLE
ROLLER SUITCASES.

23:31.090 --> 23:33.911
AND I'M HERE IN THIS BIG HOUSE
ALONE, BY MYSELF HALF THE TIME,

23:34.030 --> 23:35.361
AND THE MAN
THAT I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH

23:35.480 --> 23:36.856
FOR 12 YEARS CAN HARDLY
LOOK ME IN THE FACE,

23:36.960 --> 23:39.542
SO I DON'T REALLY WANT TO HAVE
A NICE CHAT ABOUT IT WITH YOU.

23:39.650 --> 23:41.345
THANKS ANYWAY.

23:41.450 --> 23:44.863
I REALLY--I JUST WISH
I HAD NEVER MET YOU.

23:44.970 --> 23:47.131
- OKAY, LOOK,
I'M SORRY FOR COMING BY,

23:47.250 --> 23:49.832
AND I'M SORRY FOR WHATEVER PART
I PLAYED IN THIS.

23:49.940 --> 23:52.420
BUT IF YOU HONESTLY THINK
THAT I'M THE SOLE REASON

23:52.530 --> 23:54.350
WHY YOU AND JOEL
ARE HAVING PROBLEMS,

23:54.460 --> 23:56.667
THEN YOU'RE JUST
KIDDING YOURSELF.

23:56.780 --> 23:59.248
AND IF YOU REALLY WANT
YOUR MARRIAGE BACK,

23:59.360 --> 24:03.012
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DIG
A LITTLE DEEPER.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.948
- FEEL THIS? FEEL GOOD?
- I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

24:13.070 --> 24:14.139
I'M, LIKE, ALREADY WASTED FROM
US DRINKING BEFORE WE GOT HERE.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.684
- DOESN'T MATTER.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME.

24:15.790 --> 24:17.724
COME ON, WE'RE EXCITED.
- NATALIE TALKED TO ME EARLIER.

24:17.830 --> 24:19.309
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
- SHE WAS MAD AT ME.

24:19.420 --> 24:21.968
- NO NATALIE.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT NATALIE.

24:22.080 --> 24:22.967
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND ME

24:23.080 --> 24:25.731
AND THE FUN FOLKS
THAT WE USED TO BE, OKAY?

24:25.840 --> 24:26.909
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD FOR US
TO LET LOOSE.

24:27.010 --> 24:28.944
- YEAH.
- AND I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.598
WE'RE GONNA MAKE A DEAL.
PINKY KISS.

24:31.710 --> 24:34.736
WE ARE GOING TO EACH MAKE OUT
WITH SOMEBODY TONIGHT.

24:34.850 --> 24:35.919
- I CAN'T PROMISE THAT.
- WE HAVE TO.

24:36.020 --> 24:37.669
COME ON, WE HAVE TO.
WE HAVE TO PINKY KISS.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.645
- MAKE OUT WITH SOMEONE.
- YES.

24:39.750 --> 24:41.479
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.093
OKAY, WHOO!
WE CAN DO THIS.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.098
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.065
STICK TOGETHER FOR A SECOND.

24:46.170 --> 24:47.751
[water running]

24:47.860 --> 24:49.589
- I'M JUST SAYING
THAT A COUPLE

24:49.690 --> 24:51.066
BY DEFINITION IS TWO,

24:51.170 --> 24:53.172
SO WHEN THEY SAY THEY'RE
GONNA CALL IN A COUPLE DAYS,

24:53.280 --> 24:54.349
THEY SHOULD CALL IN TWO DAYS.

24:54.450 --> 24:56.486
- HONEY, I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA
HEAR ABOUT IT TOMORROW.

24:56.590 --> 24:57.796
IT'S FINE.
DON'T WORRY.

24:57.910 --> 24:59.662
YOU'RE STRESSING OUT
OVER NOTHING.

24:59.770 --> 25:00.907
- I'M SORRY, I KNOW
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

25:01.010 --> 25:01.999
YOU'RE GONNA GET
A GREAT REPORT.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.314
YOU'RE SO HEALTHY, SO...
- REALLY HEALTHY.

25:03.430 --> 25:04.454
- THE END.
I'M DONE.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.595
DR. BEDSLOE
SAID HE WOULD CALL

25:06.710 --> 25:07.938
IF HE KNEW ANYTHING
AHEAD OF TIME.

25:08.050 --> 25:11.053
I'M SURE THEY'RE JUST CHECKING
EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.252
- OKAY.

25:12.370 --> 25:13.462
- YOU KNOW, I JUST WAS THINKING
ABOUT MR. KNIGHT.

25:13.580 --> 25:14.365
EVEN THOUGH
HE'S A LITTLE UNCONVENTIONAL,

25:14.470 --> 25:17.439
I THINK
HIS PHILOSOPHY IS JUST--

25:17.550 --> 25:18.949
I DON'T KNOW.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.789
IT'S KIND OF OUTSTANDING,
AND IT'S DIFFERENT,

25:20.890 --> 25:22.619
AND HE'S VERY SMART.
- MM-HMM.

25:22.720 --> 25:23.891
YES, REALLY SMART.
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.729
JUST THE WAY THAT HE IS
AND WHAT HE EMULATES

25:25.830 --> 25:26.899
AND JUST PUTS OFF--

25:27.000 --> 25:29.480
- YEAH, PUTS OFF, YEAH.
- PUTS OUT THERE.

25:29.590 --> 25:31.865
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT?

25:31.970 --> 25:33.176
- YOU GOT A LITTLE TONGUE-TIED
WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO HIM.

25:33.290 --> 25:34.279
- NO, I DIDN'T.

25:34.390 --> 25:35.618
- KRISTINA, IT'S OKAY
IF YOU FIND HIM ATTRACTIVE.

25:35.740 --> 25:36.559
- STOP IT.
I DON'T FIND HIM ATTRACTIVE.

25:36.670 --> 25:38.001
- I'M SECURE.
- LISTEN.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.212
- ALL RIGHT, I'M LISTENING.
- THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.389
HE MADE SOME REALLY VALID POINTS
ABOUT THE SCHOOL.

25:41.500 --> 25:44.116
YOU KNOW, I JUST FEEL LIKE
I DON'T WANT TO START SOMETHING

25:44.230 --> 25:45.709
AND GET IN OVER OUR HEAD,
AND IT'S A HUGE--

25:45.820 --> 25:47.048
- WE'RE ALWAYS IN
OVER OUR HEADS.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.502
YOU JUST RAN FOR MAYOR.
REMEMBER THAT?

25:48.610 --> 25:49.918
- YEAH, I DO REMEMBER THAT.

25:50.030 --> 25:52.089
I DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE UNREALISTIC,

25:52.200 --> 25:54.612
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

25:54.720 --> 25:55.994
THAT WE CAN FOLLOW THROUGH ON.

25:56.100 --> 25:57.408
- DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU,
KRISTINA,

25:57.520 --> 25:58.544
BEING AFRAID
OF SOMETHING UNREALISTIC.

25:58.660 --> 26:01.652
- I'M NOT AFRAID OF IT, ADAM.
I'M JUST SAYING--

26:01.760 --> 26:03.204
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.241
YOU HAD A GREAT IDEA,

26:04.350 --> 26:05.317
AND WE'RE STARTING THIS SCHOOL

26:05.420 --> 26:07.934
BECAUSE OUR SON, MAX, DESERVES
A GOOD PLACE TO LEARN,

26:08.040 --> 26:09.450
AND SO DO OTHER KIDS
LIKE MAX.

26:09.560 --> 26:10.970
- YEAH, I KNOW.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.321
- ONE HANDSOME TEACHER
WHO'S GOT AN AWESOME PERSONALITY

26:13.430 --> 26:14.522
DOES NOT A BAD IDEA MAKE.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.154
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- OKAY?

26:17.260 --> 26:19.114
IT'S A GOOD IDEA,

26:19.230 --> 26:22.324
AND THAT'S WHY
WE NEED TO DO THIS.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.465
I LOVE YOU.

26:24.580 --> 26:27.435
[soft acoustic music]

26:34.040 --> 26:34.654
[knock on door]
- [screams]

26:34.760 --> 26:37.479
OH, MY GOD.
- IT'S ME.

26:37.590 --> 26:39.034
- HANK!
- YEAH.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.380
- UGH.

26:43.420 --> 26:45.001
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
IT'S LATE.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.008
YOU SCARED ME.
- I KNOW IT'S LATE.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.382
THAT'S WHY I LOOKED IN THERE.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.639
I CAN SEE RIGHT IN THERE.
- DON'T KNOCK FROM THE STREET.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.116
IT'S CRAZY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:52.230 --> 26:55.324
- ARE YOU PACKING UP
FOR THE PERSONAL MATTER?

26:55.440 --> 26:56.395
- YEAH, I AM.

26:56.510 --> 26:59.092
- YOU GOT A MALARIA NET?

26:59.200 --> 27:01.259
- OH, WELL, I GUESS
YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO AFRICA,

27:01.370 --> 27:02.473
AND YOU'RE MAD ABOUT IT.

27:02.580 --> 27:03.717
- I'M NOT MAD.
I'M NOT MAD.

27:03.820 --> 27:04.684
- NO?
- NO, NOBODY SAID I WAS MAD.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.712
- WELL, WHAT?
- I'M DISAPPOINTED.

27:06.830 --> 27:08.206
- UH-HUH.
- DISAPPOINTED, YEAH.

27:08.310 --> 27:12.269
WE STARTED THIS PROJECT,
AND I SAW SOMETHING NEW IN YOU.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.312
YOU REALLY WANTED THIS,
YOU WERE FOCUSED,

27:13.420 --> 27:16.002
AND I THOUGHT
THAT WE WERE MAKING SOMETHING

27:16.110 --> 27:17.452
THAT COULD TURN OUT
TO BE REALLY GOOD.

27:17.560 --> 27:18.549
- WE ARE.

27:18.670 --> 27:19.659
- YEAH, BUT THEN--
- WE WILL.

27:19.770 --> 27:21.078
- YOU JUST STARTED
DOING SOMETHING

27:21.190 --> 27:22.521
THAT I'VE SEEN YOU DO
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.971
I'M SEEING PATTERNS.

27:24.090 --> 27:26.536
YOU GOT A GOOD JOB HERE,
YOU GOT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY,

27:26.640 --> 27:28.631
AND YOU'RE BLOWING IT OFF
FOR SOME GUY.

27:28.750 --> 27:29.910
- WHAT IS THIS?
- I DON'T KNOW--

27:30.020 --> 27:31.260
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- LISTEN.

27:31.370 --> 27:32.985
IF YOU'RE SCARED--
MAYBE DEEP DOWN YOU THINK

27:33.090 --> 27:34.648
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT
AS A PHOTOGRAPHER,

27:34.750 --> 27:36.058
WHATEVER IT IS.

27:36.170 --> 27:37.501
AND THIS IS REGARDLESS
OF WHAT I THINK OF THAT GUY,

27:37.620 --> 27:39.133
WHICH IS
THAT HE PRETTY MUCH SUCKS,

27:39.240 --> 27:40.958
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING BECAUSE
HE GETS YOU THE JOB AND NOW--

27:41.070 --> 27:42.094
- HE DIDN'T GET ME THE JOB.

27:42.210 --> 27:43.347
- WELL, WHATEVER,
HE HELPED YOU DO IT,

27:43.450 --> 27:45.031
AND NOW HE'S TELLING YOU
THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

27:45.140 --> 27:47.415
I'M JUST--I'M REPORTING TO YOU
THAT I'M SEEING YOU DO

27:47.520 --> 27:49.488
WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO.

27:49.590 --> 27:50.522
- MM.
- YOU PUT A MAN BEFORE YOURSELF.

27:50.630 --> 27:52.666
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD DO THAT.

27:52.770 --> 27:54.522
- OKAY, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

27:54.630 --> 27:55.426
ARE YOU DONE?
- ARE YOU PISSED AT ME?

27:55.530 --> 27:57.669
- YES, I AM,

27:57.770 --> 27:59.351
BECAUSE YOU'RE COMING OVER HERE
AND REPORTING...

27:59.470 --> 28:01.461
- I'M JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST.
- YOUR HONESTY TO ME.

28:01.570 --> 28:03.743
I DIDN'T ASK.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.579
HOW DARE YOU TELL ME
ABOUT MY PROBLEMS AND PATTERNS

28:05.680 --> 28:08.672
WHEN I DON'T SEE YOU
ANY MORE CONNECTED

28:08.790 --> 28:11.020
TO SOMEBODY THAN YOU WERE
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER?

28:11.130 --> 28:14.543
I MEAN, YOU'RE MR. PERFECT
RELATIONSHIP, GREAT CAREER GUY?

28:14.650 --> 28:15.924
NO.

28:16.030 --> 28:18.032
I'M TAKING
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY

28:18.140 --> 28:20.131
TO DO SOMETHING VERY COOL,

28:20.250 --> 28:22.309
AND WHY DO YOU HAVE TO COME OVER
AND MAKE ME FEEL BAD ABOUT IT?

28:22.420 --> 28:23.728
- ALL RIGHT.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.456
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.
I'M GONNA GO.

28:26.560 --> 28:27.731
ENJOY YOUR TRIP.

28:27.840 --> 28:28.932
YOU KNOW, AND I'LL EMAIL YOU

28:29.050 --> 28:30.563
IF SOMETHING COMES UP
WITH THE PROJECT.

28:30.670 --> 28:31.489
- [scoffs]

28:34.880 --> 28:36.324
- COME ON, ZEEK.

28:36.430 --> 28:39.911
WE'VE BEEN BACK AND FORTH
WITH THIS FOR MONTHS NOW,

28:40.020 --> 28:42.671
AND FINALLY
WE REACH A CAREFUL

28:42.790 --> 28:45.293
AND WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS A MUTUAL DECISION.

28:45.410 --> 28:47.230
AND I THINK THAT AT LAST,
IT'S FINALLY OVER,

28:47.340 --> 28:48.546
AND YOU WON'T DROP IT.

28:48.650 --> 28:51.539
INSTEAD, YOU ENLIST YOUR SON
TO FIGHT YOUR BATTLES.

28:51.660 --> 28:53.867
- I DIDN'T ENLIST ANYBODY,
CAMILLE.

28:53.970 --> 28:56.552
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

28:56.660 --> 28:58.582
- HE CALLED ME SELFISH.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.520
CROSBY--
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:00.630 --> 29:02.074
IT'S AFTER MIDNIGHT.
- SHH.

29:02.180 --> 29:03.147
COME HERE, COME HERE,
COME HERE, COME HERE.

29:03.250 --> 29:05.810
LISTEN TO THIS.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.492
- CROSBY, JASMINE, THE KIDS--
THEY'RE HERE.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.181
I MEAN, SO WHAT--

29:10.300 --> 29:12.632
- I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO FIGHTS
FOR 30 YEARS THROUGH THIS VENT,

29:12.750 --> 29:14.911
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU,
THIS IS A BAD ONE.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.464
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.639
SHE SAID THAT I WAS THE MOST
SELFISH MEMBER OF THIS FAMILY.

29:18.750 --> 29:20.786
THAT'S CLEARLY SARAH.

29:20.890 --> 29:23.541
THAT'S HOW WOUND UP SHE IS,
NO OBJECT IVITY.

29:23.650 --> 29:25.789
- UNLIKE SARAH, THEY WON'T
STAY HERE FOR YEARS AND YEARS.

29:25.900 --> 29:29.347
- OOH, THAT'S HARSH.
GLAD SARAH DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

29:29.450 --> 29:30.439
- YOU SAID SOMETHING TO HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

29:30.560 --> 29:33.905
- I TRIED TO HAVE
AN ADULT CONVERSATION WITH HER--

29:34.010 --> 29:35.102
- I TOLD YOU
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING.

29:35.220 --> 29:36.380
YOU PROMISED.
- I SAID--

29:36.490 --> 29:37.593
LISTEN, IT WAS GOING FINE,

29:37.700 --> 29:39.179
BUT I MENTIONED
THE WORD "SELFISH,"

29:39.290 --> 29:40.496
WHICH I BELIEVE SHE'S BEING,
AND SHE WENT BALLISTIC.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.114
- OH, MY GOD,
I TOLD YOU THIS WOULD BLOW UP.

29:43.220 --> 29:44.152
I TOLD YOU.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.148
- YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING
TO CROSBY

29:46.260 --> 29:47.568
ABOUT WANTING
TO SELL THE HOUSE.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.124
- OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE,

29:49.230 --> 29:51.676
ALL I DID WAS HAVE AN HONEST,
FACE-TO-FACE CONVERSATION

29:51.790 --> 29:54.099
WITH MY OWN SON.
LOOK, SWEETHEART--

29:54.200 --> 29:57.374
- WE CANNOT STAY HERE.
- WE GOT TO GO.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.789
- WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT
OF THIS HOUSE.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.653
[energetic rock music]

30:16.400 --> 30:17.776
- HEY.
- HEY.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.495
- HEY.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.464
QUITE A PARTY, HUH?
- YEAH.

30:21.570 --> 30:22.559
- WHOO.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.648
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,
IT'S NOT EXACTLY MY SCENE,

30:24.750 --> 30:26.980
BUT I'M TRYING TO BRANCH OUT,
YOU KNOW?

30:27.100 --> 30:28.988
I'M JUST GOING
THROUGH A BREAKUP, YOU KNOW,

30:29.100 --> 30:31.022
SO I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS, SO I--

30:31.130 --> 30:33.849
OH, THAT'S--
- IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU.

30:33.970 --> 30:35.688
- ALL RIGHT.

30:35.790 --> 30:36.927
OUCH.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.315
- HEY, LITTLE DREW.
- HI.

30:39.420 --> 30:40.626
I NEED TO HOOK UP
WITH SOMEONE HERE,

30:40.730 --> 30:42.698
LIKE, NOW-ISH.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.075
I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THESE--

30:45.180 --> 30:45.760
- COME WITH ME.
- THIS IS YOUR THING.

30:45.870 --> 30:47.758
CAN YOU HELP ME?
- YEAH.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.667
I'M A MAN OF THE PEOPLE.
- GREAT.

30:50.770 --> 30:52.010
SHOULDN'T BE THIS HARD.

30:52.120 --> 30:56.819
- OH, YOUR BROTHER
IS OVER THERE SOMEWHERE.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.775
- YEAH, HE'S MY BROTHER.

30:59.890 --> 31:00.640
I'M NOT GONNA HOOK UP
WITH MY BROTHER TONIGHT.

31:00.750 --> 31:02.024
- OH, RIGHT.

31:02.130 --> 31:04.781
- IT'S JUST NOT ON THE ROSTER
FOR THE EVENING.

31:04.890 --> 31:06.334
I'D JUST LOVE IT
IF I COULD--

31:06.450 --> 31:07.610
OH, NO!
NO!

31:07.720 --> 31:11.030
NO. NO!

31:11.140 --> 31:13.108
NO, WRONG.
THAT'S--

31:13.210 --> 31:15.587
THIS IS--THIS IS WRONG.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.622
THIS IS--
I HAVE TO GET OUT.

31:17.730 --> 31:18.867
- I THOUGHT IT WAS AWESOME.

31:18.980 --> 31:20.834
- BERTO, HEY, WHAT'S UP?
- HEY, NATALIE.

31:20.940 --> 31:22.976
- HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?
- GOOD.

31:23.080 --> 31:23.944
- HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN DREW
ANYWHERE?

31:24.050 --> 31:27.770
- YEAH, HE'S OVER THERE
SOMEWHERE.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.769
BUT, HEY, LISTEN.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.394
BROSKI IS ON A MISSION TONIGHT.
- OKAY.

31:33.510 --> 31:34.602
- OUT TO GET SOME TAIL,

31:34.720 --> 31:37.120
SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE OUT
WITH HIM OR ANYTHING,

31:37.240 --> 31:39.572
NO DICE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

31:39.690 --> 31:41.260
- GOT IT.
YEAH.

31:41.380 --> 31:44.099
- HEY, ARE YOU UP
FOR SOME MUD WRESTLING?

31:44.210 --> 31:45.234
- EXCUSE ME.
SORRY.

31:45.350 --> 31:47.443
- NO.
- SORRY. HI, NATALIE, HI.

31:47.560 --> 31:48.629
BERTO. HEY.

31:49.870 --> 31:51.963
- YOU CAME.

31:52.080 --> 31:52.830
- YEAH, I JUST WANTED TO SEE
WHAT THE BIG DEAL WAS.

31:52.940 --> 31:56.182
- YEAH, THERE'S, LIKE, UM--

31:56.290 --> 31:57.143
SO THERE'S DRINKS OVER THERE.

31:57.260 --> 31:57.806
YOU WANT ME
TO GET YOU A DRINK?

31:57.910 --> 32:00.424
- NO, I'M GOOD.

32:00.530 --> 32:02.157
I THINK I'M GONNA TAKE OFF,
ACTUALLY.

32:02.260 --> 32:03.773
- NO, HERE,
I'LL WALK YOU OUT THEN.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.087
- NO, I HEAR
YOU'RE A MAN ON A MISSION.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.509

32:24.800 --> 32:26.279
[both chuckle]

32:26.390 --> 32:29.143
I GOT, LIKE,
EIGHT MOVIES HERE,

32:29.250 --> 32:30.979
INCLUDING MUSCLE SHOALS.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.251
HAVE YOU HEAﬁg ABOUT THAT?

32:32.360 --> 32:33.736
- MUSIC DOC.
SUPPOSED TO BE AMAZING.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.707
AND A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LOVE.

32:36.810 --> 32:38.323
- HEY, CARL.
- BAGS.

32:38.430 --> 32:40.569
DO YOU--

32:40.680 --> 32:41.988
WHERE'S YOUR STUFF?

32:42.090 --> 32:43.819
- I CAN'T GO.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.262
_ WH--

32:45.370 --> 32:46.166
HUH?

32:46.270 --> 32:47.817
- I KNOW
IT SOUNDS CRAZY.

32:47.930 --> 32:50.785
I'M SURE I'LL NEVER HAVE
THIS CHANCE AGAIN.

32:50.890 --> 32:53.063
BUT I WAS GETTING READY,

32:53.170 --> 32:56.412
AND I LOOKED
IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR,

32:56.520 --> 32:57.930
AND YOU KNOW
THAT STICKER I HAVE?

32:58.040 --> 33:01.271
- YEAH, YEAH, I DO.
THE--I SAW THAT.

33:01.390 --> 33:04.006
"THE YEAR OF SARAH."
- "THE YEAR OF SARAH," I WROTE--

33:04.120 --> 33:05.929
- I WAS GONNA ASK, BUT I--

33:06.050 --> 33:08.143
- WHEN I MOVED IN,
I PUT THAT UP,

33:08.260 --> 33:11.252
AS CORNY AS THAT SEEMS,

33:11.360 --> 33:15.535
TO REMIND MYSELF
WHAT A BIG YEAR THIS IS,

33:15.640 --> 33:19.713
FINALLY LIVING ON MY OWN,
NOT AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE.

33:19.820 --> 33:24.439
MY KIDS ARE DOING WELL.
I'M STARTING A NEW CAREER.

33:24.550 --> 33:28.031
I HAVE A TENDENCY
TO GET DISTRACT ED,

33:28.140 --> 33:33.203
AND I PUT THAT NOTE UP
TO REMIND MYSELF

33:33.320 --> 33:35.902
NOT TO GET DISTRACT ED.

33:36.010 --> 33:40.140
- YES, DISTRACT IONS
CAN BE DANGEROUS.

33:40.250 --> 33:44.016
- ESPECIALLY
WHEN THEY LOOK SO GOOD.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.362
- AND I'M GUESSING
WHEN I GET BACK, THAT'S--

33:48.880 --> 33:50.848
- YEAH.

33:50.950 --> 33:52.986
I DON'T THINK--

33:53.100 --> 33:55.500
- YEAH.

33:55.610 --> 33:59.023
WELL, I'VE GOT A PLANE
TO CATCH.

34:00.310 --> 34:02.062
- HAVE A GREAT TIME.

34:02.170 --> 34:06.823
- I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.
- I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

34:06.940 --> 34:09.795
[melancholy music]

34:12.320 --> 34:13.799
- SO TOMATOES ARE JUST ONE
OF THE MANY VEGETABLES

34:13.910 --> 34:14.695
WE HAVE HERE TODAY.

34:14.810 --> 34:18.394
- TOMATOES ARE A FRUIT.
- OKAY, REALLY?

34:18.500 --> 34:21.116
- YEAH, TOMATOES ARE A FRUIT.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

34:21.230 --> 34:22.709
- OKAY, WELL--

34:22.810 --> 34:25.677
- DID YOU EVEN DO YOUR RESEARCH
BEFORE YOU CAME IN TO TEACH US?

34:25.780 --> 34:28.294
- YES, I DID.
- THIS CARROT TASTES LIKE DIRT.

34:28.410 --> 34:30.742
IT'S DISGUSTING.
I'M NOT EATING IT.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.578
- AH, IT'S A VEGETABLE.

34:32.690 --> 34:35.545
THERE WAS A SUPREME COURT CASE
IN 1893,

34:35.650 --> 34:39.063
AND THEY DECIDED THAT TOMATOES
ARE INDEED A VEGETABLE.

34:39.180 --> 34:41.273
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE TOMATO SAID ON THE STAND?

34:41.380 --> 34:42.859
HUH?

34:44.220 --> 34:46.029
- NOTHING?
- YEAH.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.902
YOU THINK THAT TASTES LIKE DIRT?
- YEAH.

34:48.010 --> 34:50.592
- HAVE YOU HAD MUCH DIRT?
- NONE AT ALL.

34:50.700 --> 34:52.975
- WELL, I'M KIND OF
A DIRT CONNOISSEUR,

34:53.090 --> 34:53.909
SO WE COULD DO
A LITTLE TASTE TEST

34:54.020 --> 34:56.181
OF A BOWL OF DIRT
AND A CARROT.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.289
WE COULD TRY 'EM BY SIDE
BY SIDE, A LITTLE COMPARISON.

34:57.400 --> 35:00.289
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- I'M NOT TASTING DIRT WITH YOU.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.810
- THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.
DOES TASTE A LITTLE LIKE DIRT.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.888
- I TOLD YOU.

35:03.990 --> 35:06.049
- OKAY.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.479
- HEY, HONEY.
- IN THERE, COOK IT UP.

35:08.580 --> 35:10.468
- BE CAREFUL WITH THAT, THOUGH,
'CAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT--

35:10.590 --> 35:11.579
- YEP, SHE JUST WANTED TO SEE
WHAT YOU WERE COOKING.

35:11.690 --> 35:12.418
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO TURN IT DOWN
A LITTLE BIT.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.750
- JUST SOME SPAGHE'I'I'I.
- [laughs]

35:14.870 --> 35:17.759
[phone ringing]

35:18.970 --> 35:19.937
OKAY.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.247
HEY, HONEY.
- YEAH?

35:22.360 --> 35:24.669
[phone rings]

35:24.770 --> 35:25.976
- HELLO?

35:26.080 --> 35:29.220
YEAH.

35:37.060 --> 35:39.119
OKAY, THAT'S--
THAT'S GREAT.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.403
THAT'S--
YEAH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

35:42.510 --> 35:45.513
I WILL SEE YOU
IN SIX MONTHS.

35:45.620 --> 35:48.339
THAN KS.
BYE.

35:48.450 --> 35:51.726
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

35:51.830 --> 35:53.969
- ALL CLEAR.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.286
ALL CLEAR.
- CLEAR.

35:55.390 --> 35:56.869
- MY BLOOD WORK IS--YEAH.
- THAT'S GOOD.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.117
- IS SPECTACULAR.
- CLEAR IS GOOD.

35:58.220 --> 36:02.520
- NO TUMORS, NO SHADOWS, NO--
GOOD.

36:02.640 --> 36:03.948
I'M GOOD TO GO.
I'M PERFECT.

36:04.050 --> 36:06.052
- PERFECT.
- YEAH.

36:06.160 --> 36:09.675
- GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

36:09.780 --> 36:12.647
- YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.
- YEAH.

36:12.750 --> 36:13.921
- HONEY.
- I'M SORRY.

36:14.030 --> 36:16.169
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M DOING THIS.
- COME HERE, COME HERE.

36:16.270 --> 36:18.921
IT'S OKAY.

36:19.030 --> 36:22.750
- OH, GOD.
- IT'S OKAY.

36:22.870 --> 36:25.384
- YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST SEEING 'EM GO IN,

36:25.490 --> 36:27.549
THOSE WOMEN--I JUST--
- I KNOW.

36:27.660 --> 36:29.457
- I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU TO HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.868
- I KNOW.
IT'S GONNA BE A ROAD, THOUGH.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.312
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA BE
SCAN TO SCAN EVERY SIX MONTHS.

36:33.430 --> 36:34.761
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO KEEP DOING THIS

36:34.880 --> 36:38.259
AND KEEP ON WAITING
FOR SOMETHING BAD TO HAPPEN.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.600
- OKAY, WE'RE NOT THOSE PEOPLE

36:39.710 --> 36:40.938
WHO ARE GONNA WAIT FOR SOMETHING
BAD TO HAPPEN, OKAY?

36:41.060 --> 36:42.561
- NO, NO, WE'RE NOT.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.227
- WE'RE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA
MAKE THINGS HAPPEN, RIGHT?

36:44.340 --> 36:46.808
- YEAH, GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN.
- COME ON.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.239
- [chuckles]

36:54.660 --> 36:55.513
- HI.
- HI.

36:55.620 --> 36:57.269
MR. AND MRS. BRAVERMAN.

36:57.380 --> 37:00.315
- HI, WE JUST WANTED TO STOP BY
AND TALK TO YOU

37:00.420 --> 37:02.456
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT
STARTING THE CHARTER SCHOOL

37:02.560 --> 37:04.664
THE OTHER DAY, WHEN WE WERE
HAVING THE CONVERSATION--

37:04.770 --> 37:06.977
- WE REALIZE THIS IS
INCREDIBLY INAPPROPRIATE

37:07.080 --> 37:08.308
FOR US
TO JUST DROP BY UNANNOUNCED.

37:08.430 --> 37:10.523
- RIGHT, AND WHAT YOU WERE
SAYING ABOUT OTHER PARENTS

37:10.640 --> 37:11.971
THAT--YOU KNOW, THAT DON'T
FINISH THINGS--WHAT THEY START

37:12.090 --> 37:14.979
AND MAYBE ONLY DOING
A CHARTER SCHOOL FOR FOUR YEARS,

37:15.090 --> 37:16.876
WE WANT TO TELL YOU
THAT WE ARE NOT THOSE PARENTS.

37:16.990 --> 37:18.878
WE DON'T WANT TO START SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN'T FINISH.

37:18.990 --> 37:21.094
WE WANT TO OPEN A SCHOOL THAT'S
GONNA RUN FOREVER AND EVER.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.053
AND I JUST GOT
A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH,

37:22.170 --> 37:24.024
AND IT SOUNDS CRAZY FOR ME
TO BE TELLING YOU THIS,

37:24.130 --> 37:26.132
BUT I'M STICKING AROUND,

37:26.240 --> 37:27.719
AND I WANT TO STICK AROUND
LONG ENOUGH

37:27.830 --> 37:30.207
NOT JUST TO HELP MY KID
BUT TO HELP ALL KIDS.

37:30.310 --> 37:31.652
- A LOT OF KIDS,
A LOT OF FAMILIES.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.409
AND WE WANT YOUR HELP.
- YES, WE DO WANT YOUR HELP.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.487
WE HAVE THE PASSION
AND THE BALLS

37:34.590 --> 37:35.761
AND THE ENERGY
AND THE DRIVE,

37:35.870 --> 37:37.838
AND WE NEED AN EDUCATOR
THAT'S GONNA COME IN

37:37.940 --> 37:39.828
AND DRIVE THAT TRAIN WITH US
AND HELP US.

37:39.940 --> 37:40.907
AND WE THINK THAT PERSON'S YOU.
- WE'RE HERE TO ASK YOU

37:41.010 --> 37:41.829
IF YOU WOULD RUN THE SCHOOL.

37:41.940 --> 37:43.146
WE'RE HOPING TO OPEN UP
IN THE FALL.

37:43.260 --> 37:45.251
- YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER HAD
PARENTS COME TO MY HOUSE BEFORE.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.703
- I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

37:47.810 --> 37:49.493
IT'S REALLY RUDE.
- THIS IS IMPORTANT TO US.

37:49.610 --> 37:52.192
VERY SORRY.
- I LIKE IT.

37:52.300 --> 37:54.439
TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE SCHOOL.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.542
- OKAY, WELL, WE SEE...
both: A SMALL SCHOOL.

37:56.650 --> 37:58.197
- YOU KNOW,
FACULTY-STUDENT RATIO

37:58.310 --> 38:00.335
IS FOUR TO ONE
AT THE VERY MOST.

38:00.450 --> 38:02.099
AND A SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM
IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US,

38:02.210 --> 38:03.586
SO IT DOESN'T JUST BENEFIT

38:03.690 --> 38:05.658
THE WEALTHY KIDS--
IT BENEFITS ALL KIDS.

38:05.760 --> 38:06.863
- WE'RE LOOKING OUT
FOR THE KIDS.

38:06.970 --> 38:08.107
WE'VE JUST SEEN
TOO MANY OF THESE KIDS

38:08.210 --> 38:09.177
JUST FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS.
- YEAH.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.554
- SOCIAL SKILLS.
WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

38:10.660 --> 38:14.141
- YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T
WE TALK ABOUT THIS OVER COFFEE?

38:14.250 --> 38:15.217
YOU GUYS WANT TO COME IN
AND HAVE A COFFEE?

38:15.320 --> 38:17.185
- I LOVE COFFEE.
- YEAH, OKAY.

38:17.290 --> 38:20.396
- THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

38:22.950 --> 38:26.431
- HEY.
- HEY.

38:26.540 --> 38:30.852
- WELL, I DIDN'T GO
TO AFRICA.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.814
I MEAN, YOU WERE RIGHT,
YOU KNOW, THAT--

38:32.930 --> 38:34.238
I MEAN, SOME OF THE THINGS
YOU SAID ABOUT,

38:34.340 --> 38:35.375
YOU KNOW, THE JOB.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.993
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY REASON,

38:37.100 --> 38:39.273
BUT I JUST THOUGHT,
YOU KNOW,

38:39.380 --> 38:41.268
THIS THING WITH CARL IS--

38:41.380 --> 38:44.622
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT...

38:44.730 --> 38:45.549
[sighs]

38:45.660 --> 38:48.629
I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T GO.

38:48.740 --> 38:52.380
SO SEE YOU AT WORK TOMORROW.

38:52.500 --> 38:56.391
- WELL, HEY.

38:56.500 --> 39:00.743
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS
FOR THE SECOND TO LAST PAGE?

39:00.850 --> 39:03.057
- HMM.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.604
FOR TH E--
- WITH ALL THE--

39:04.720 --> 39:05.914
- YEAH, THE CREDITS.
- YEAH.

39:06.030 --> 39:08.191
- THE BOARD MEMBERS.
- INSIDE OF THE BACK PAGE.

39:08.310 --> 39:10.198
- I LIKE IT.
- YEAH, I MEAN, THAT WAS--

39:10.310 --> 39:13.609
IT WAS EITHER THAT OR THIS.
I WAS STUCK ON THIS FOR A WHILE.

39:13.730 --> 39:14.958
- THINK IT'S THAT.
- IT IS, RIGHT?

39:15.070 --> 39:17.209
- YEAH, I THINK SO.
- THIS IS HOW WE DO IT, RIGHT?

39:17.320 --> 39:18.139
- YES.

39:18.250 --> 39:23.142
[indistinct chatter]

39:23.250 --> 39:25.662
- SO, MOM, DAD,

39:25.770 --> 39:26.452
WE HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS.

39:26.570 --> 39:30.563
WE FOUND A CONDO
TO SUBLET,

39:30.670 --> 39:32.638
SO WE'LL BE GETTING OUT
OF YOUR HAIR ON SUNDAY.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.913
_ THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING,
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY,

39:35.020 --> 39:36.055
AND OPENING YOUR HOME.

39:36.160 --> 39:38.128
WE KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN
REALLY CRAZY FOR BOTH OF YOU

39:38.230 --> 39:39.470
AROUND HERE.

39:39.580 --> 39:42.401
- WHAT--YOU'RE LEAVING?
WHY?

39:42.510 --> 39:44.137
- WELL, YOU GUYS HAVE A LOT
GOING ON AROUND HERE.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.446
WE THOUGHT
IT WOULD JUST BE

39:45.550 --> 39:48.417
HELPFUL, BETTER.
- YEAH.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.612
- YOU KNOW.

39:49.730 --> 39:51.209
- WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

39:51.310 --> 39:53.483
- WE GOT A PRETTY GOOD DEAL,
ACTUALLY.

39:53.590 --> 39:55.319
IT'S LIKE A FRIEND-OF-A—FRIEND
TYPE OF--

39:55.420 --> 39:57.980
AND IT'S ONLY FOR ANOTHER MONTH
MAYBE, SO...

39:58.080 --> 39:59.559
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU WOULDN'T STAY HERE.

39:59.670 --> 40:02.070
I MEAN, WHY WOULD YOU STAY
IN A STRANGER'S HOUSE?

40:02.190 --> 40:03.464
- WELL, LOOK, WE JUST--

40:03.570 --> 40:04.662
WE DON'T WANT TO BE
IN ANYONE'S WAY AND--

40:04.780 --> 40:07.157
- YOU'RE NOT IN ANYONE'S WAY.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

40:07.260 --> 40:09.535
AND YOU'RE NOT MOVING OUT.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.528
THIS IS YOUR HOME
AS LONG AS YOU NEED IT TO BE,

40:11.650 --> 40:15.711
AND I WON'T HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY, SO...

40:15.820 --> 40:17.685
SETTLED.

40:17.790 --> 40:20.441
JABBAR, WANT TO DISH UP
SOME SUNDAES WITH ME?

40:20.550 --> 40:22.199
- YEAH.

40:22.310 --> 40:24.175
[knock on door]

40:27.800 --> 40:28.721
- HI.

40:28.840 --> 40:32.458
- THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME
WITH SYDNEY.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.492
- NO PROBLEM.

40:33.600 --> 40:37.946
- AND I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE,

40:38.050 --> 40:42.180
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,

40:42.300 --> 40:44.188
WHAT JOEL AND I
ARE GOING THROUGH.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.291
I'VE BEEN REALIZING

40:46.400 --> 40:52.441
I AM RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY OWN MARRIAGE.

40:52.550 --> 40:56.441
- HEY, DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP
ABOUT IT.

40:56.550 --> 40:58.108
MARRIAGE IS HARD.

40:58.210 --> 41:01.099
THAT'S WHY IT HAS SUCH
AN AWESOME SUCCESS RATE.

41:01.210 --> 41:01.483
- YEAH.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.410
[chuckles]

41:03.530 --> 41:08.593
UM, I ALSO KNOW
HOW MUCH IT SUCKS

41:08.700 --> 41:10.839
EATING BY YOURSELF
WITHOUT THE KIDS,

41:10.950 --> 41:14.568
AND SO I MADE YOU
CHICKEN MARSALA.

41:14.670 --> 41:16.183
IT'S COLD NOW, BUT...
- WOW.

41:16.300 --> 41:18.564
[chuckles]

41:18.680 --> 41:20.534
- YEAH.
- THANK YOU.

41:20.650 --> 41:21.742
- I KNOW YOU LIKE IT.

41:21.850 --> 41:23.329
