49:14.285 --> 49:15.653
I think Michelle's
made it very clear

that she knows exactly how

49:17.621 --> 49:20.324

49:23.427 --> 49:26.297
‐ Yeah, so last week,
there's a guy in the house,

49:26.363 --> 49:28.866
who stood up
in front of everybody

49:28.933 --> 49:30.734
and said that there was
guys in the house

49:30.801 --> 49:33.037
walking around
like they have it in the bag.

49:33.103 --> 49:35.372
And he decides
that I'm one of the guys.

49:35.439 --> 49:37.308
‐ Is there anything
that you can think of

49:37.374 --> 49:38.409
that you might have said

49:38.476 --> 49:39.777
where he could have
interpreted it...

49:39.844 --> 49:41.579
‐ Yeah.
‐ To mean that you thought‐‐

49:41.645 --> 49:42.646
‐ Had it in the bag?
‐ Yeah.

49:42.713 --> 49:43.948
I said something
along the lines of,

49:44.014 --> 49:46.517
"It's not about if,
it's about when

49:46.584 --> 49:48.085
Michelle's gonna choose me
for a one‐on‐one."

49:48.152 --> 49:50.254
And so he kind of
took that comment as, like,

49:50.321 --> 49:52.022
"Oh, I've just got it
in the bag."

49:52.089 --> 49:53.023
Whereas for me, it's, like,

49:53.090 --> 49:54.291
when I spend time
with Michelle,

49:54.358 --> 49:56.260
I know that there's something
going on here.

49:56.327 --> 49:58.195
I'm thinking
about this girl a lot, like...

49:58.262 --> 50:00.297

‐ I'm, like, missing her.

50:00.364 --> 50:01.565
You know, she's mentioned

50:01.632 --> 50:02.967
a couple of times in our talks

50:03.033 --> 50:04.668
to be patient, you know,

50:04.735 --> 50:05.836
so it's like, you know,

50:05.903 --> 50:07.004
I had that confidence.

50:07.071 --> 50:08.172
And the way I answered
that question,

50:08.239 --> 50:09.573
I guess,
rubbed him the wrong way.

50:09.640 --> 50:10.908
So yeah.

50:10.975 --> 50:13.844
‐ In her past relationships,
it has been so hard

50:13.911 --> 50:16.046
