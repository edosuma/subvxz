00:16.027 --> 00:18.528
Anonyma

00:25.697 --> 00:29.588
A Woman in Berlin

00:34.431 --> 00:37.264
Who would've thought that?

00:38.271 --> 00:41.866
On April 16th 1945 the time had come.

00:43.471 --> 00:46.269
The Russian army had surrounded Berlin

00:46.369 --> 00:49.068
and now they were heading
towards the Reichstag.

00:51.151 --> 00:55.269
On this day,
you could see the sun behind the clouds,

00:55.391 --> 00:59.350
and the smell of lilac
wafted through all the smoke.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.991
How to start?

01:06.111 --> 01:09.069
How to find the right words?

01:11.231 --> 01:14.268
I've been a journalist,
I've traveled 12 countries.

01:14.391 --> 01:16.606
Been living in Moscow,
Paris and London.

01:16.607 --> 01:18.987
I really liked to stay
in Paris and London.

01:20.471 --> 01:25.226
I decided to come back.
I wanted to be part of it.

01:29.431 --> 01:32.309
My name doesn't matter.

01:32.431 --> 01:36.424
I am one of the many who fervently
believed in our country's future.

01:37.191 --> 01:40.149
Doubts?
Only weak persons had doubts.

01:40.271 --> 01:42.613
Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
We're always winning.

01:42.614 --> 01:45.106
The Russians don't have a leader.

01:45.231 --> 01:47.106
When they finally come to their senses,

01:47.107 --> 01:49.702
we are already knocking at
their front door in Moscow.

01:51.911 --> 01:55.790
Pardon our pushiness,
but it's war after all.

01:55.911 --> 01:57.445
Gerd hated railway stations.

01:57.446 --> 02:00.348
When he left, the sound of
his boots filled the house.

02:02.151 --> 02:04.665
We were certain to do the right thing,

02:04.666 --> 02:06.717
we breathed the same
air as everybody else.

02:06.718 --> 02:07.509
We were part of this.

02:08.830 --> 02:10.576
And then he takes off my coat and says:

02:10.577 --> 02:13.347
The Russians have no idea
what's coming towards them.

02:14.431 --> 02:18.788
So we were heading towards the
Sorbonne and chatting away in French.

02:18.911 --> 02:22.790
He thought that I was one
of those tall blond Swedes.

02:22.911 --> 02:26.790
Then I made a double step
to match my stride to his.

02:26.911 --> 02:30.870
That's when he stopped and said:
"Ah, a daughter of the Fuhrer"

02:31.671 --> 02:35.220
That was the end of the acquaintance.
What a pity.

02:36.191 --> 02:40.150
Hold on. I... I'd like to...
Stop the music, please.

02:42.831 --> 02:47.382
I would like for us all
to share this moment,

02:47.511 --> 02:51.060
this wonderful evening,
with our husbands

02:51.231 --> 02:55.110
who are stationed
somewhere all over Europe.

03:12.311 --> 03:14.142
Get lost!

03:14.271 --> 03:16.023
Run, run!

03:16.351 --> 03:17.500
Get away!

03:19.431 --> 03:23.219
Go away!
Houses on the right. Fan out.

03:34.151 --> 03:36.107
Come here, damn it!

03:36.631 --> 03:39.065
Mummy, where are you?

03:39.551 --> 03:42.384
Come on. Hurry.

04:06.111 --> 04:08.671
Away. Go away.

04:10.591 --> 04:13.663
Open fire, reload grenade.

04:14.631 --> 04:16.587
...and fire!

04:22.991 --> 04:24.219
Fire!

04:25.471 --> 04:26.620
Shit.

04:29.271 --> 04:32.820
- Wait for me.
- Watch out! Heads down.

04:33.911 --> 04:36.744
- There you are.
- Stop! Wait for me.

04:36.871 --> 04:37.860
Watch out!

04:39.791 --> 04:42.100
No!

04:48.431 --> 04:52.390
No uniforms, no weapons,
or it's martial law.

04:57.671 --> 05:00.504
Felix, where are you?

05:03.071 --> 05:04.470
Felix?

05:04.991 --> 05:09.542
- Where the hell is he? Felix?
- Not a single order.

05:09.711 --> 05:13.670
No messages, nothing at all.
Nobody gives a shit about us.

05:14.151 --> 05:18.110
Felix? Lenchen, Lenchen?
Where are you, damn it?

05:19.071 --> 05:22.386
In Wedding district, they are already
showing their toddlers to the Russians.

05:22.486 --> 05:23.701
Russian pigs.

05:23.831 --> 05:27.983
That were the book dealers.
They sometimes speak French.

05:30.431 --> 05:33.343
And that's the pharmacist's widow.

05:33.471 --> 05:38.261
Her husband once cured Minister
Hindenburg's headache.

05:38.391 --> 05:39.268
That's over.

05:39.269 --> 05:43.067
Now you step on the face
and the arms of a dead woman

05:43.511 --> 05:46.469
only to get a glass of jelly.

05:49.271 --> 05:54.299
That's the quiet Mrs. Binder.
Musician. Her husband is MIA.

05:58.791 --> 06:02.909
Can someone help?
She is suffocating.

06:04.111 --> 06:07.990
Look at me. Look at me!

06:08.671 --> 06:12.220
I will write all of this down,
I will report it.

06:13.311 --> 06:16.269
Gerd, and you shall read it.

06:16.591 --> 06:19.424
May I offer you something?

06:21.151 --> 06:22.470
Thank you.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.949
From Silesia.
She won't make it.

07:16.351 --> 07:19.787
Go, go, go!
Go down there, quick!

07:24.831 --> 07:27.789
- Mummy?
- Don't be afraid, I am here.

07:32.311 --> 07:34.108
They're coming.

07:52.271 --> 07:53.499
Halt!

08:23.831 --> 08:28.461
Attention, attention.
To all the residents of this street.

08:29.831 --> 08:33.380
All fire arms have to be
turned in immediately.

08:34.791 --> 08:37.624
This is the last warning.

08:37.991 --> 08:40.551
Attention, attention.

08:40.871 --> 08:43.703
This is the last warning.

09:36.332 --> 09:37.832
Attack!

09:51.328 --> 09:52.828
Upstairs!

09:54.218 --> 09:56.218
All the way upstairs!

10:09.352 --> 10:10.852
Go away! Not now!

10:11.031 --> 10:11.986
Attention!

10:41.868 --> 10:43.368
I... I have...

11:03.132 --> 11:04.132
Careful!

11:04.581 --> 11:06.581
Comrade Colonel.

11:06.873 --> 11:09.873
The troops have almost
reached Potsdam station.

11:11.322 --> 11:14.322
But the order was to go towards
the government district!

11:17.298 --> 11:19.798
Understood,
Comrade Colonel.

11:24.207 --> 11:25.707
We'll stay here.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.707
Major! I thought we were
going to the Reichstag.

11:28.302 --> 11:29.802
No Reichstag? But why not,
we are so close.

11:30.876 --> 11:32.876
Screw it,
we are not staying here!

11:33.136 --> 11:35.136
That's an order!

11:36.186 --> 11:39.186
Retreat!
Secure our flank!

11:41.709 --> 11:43.209
Understood?

11:47.216 --> 11:49.216
Soldiers?
Officers?

11:50.741 --> 11:52.241
Weapons?

11:53.260 --> 11:55.760
I said: Soldiers?
Officers?

11:56.871 --> 12:00.307
They will see soon enough.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.389
Anybody got weapons?
Hand them over.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.800
Get out!
One person at a time.

12:20.053 --> 12:21.053
Get out, all of you!
Move it!

12:21.791 --> 12:24.259
- Russian filth!
- Up!

12:28.592 --> 12:31.092
What... do you want?

12:37.551 --> 12:38.586
Russian?

12:40.372 --> 12:41.372
Yes.

12:46.831 --> 12:48.105
Russian!

12:49.111 --> 12:50.385
Come.

12:50.831 --> 12:51.786
Come.

12:53.151 --> 12:54.220
Eat.

12:57.431 --> 12:59.387
War kaput.

13:00.311 --> 13:01.266
Woman.

13:01.631 --> 13:03.986
Come! Eat.

13:05.591 --> 13:07.547
War kaput, woman.

13:07.605 --> 13:08.605
Come on.

13:09.951 --> 13:11.828
No fear.

13:11.951 --> 13:13.942
No fear.

13:23.111 --> 13:26.103
We will not die here.

13:46.991 --> 13:48.947
Bravo, come, come.

13:49.751 --> 13:51.264
Don't be afraid.

13:52.471 --> 13:53.426
Come.

13:54.391 --> 13:56.109
Don't shiver!

13:56.911 --> 13:58.344
Good! Come.

14:01.711 --> 14:03.667
Hey, cuties!
Come over here.

14:05.871 --> 14:08.704
You be nice and you'll
get something to eat.

14:13.951 --> 14:16.067
Potatoes. Very good.

14:58.751 --> 15:00.707
May I?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.899
Does anybody know
how this thing works?

15:34.271 --> 15:35.791
You, Ukrainian,
do you know it?

15:35.851 --> 15:39.380
There they are,
our Russian liberators.

15:39.511 --> 15:41.388
Full of joy.

15:41.511 --> 15:46.107
It seems they can hardly believe
that they've made it this far.

15:46.231 --> 15:48.703
I know them,
their sandals and villages.

15:48.704 --> 15:52.101
Their rapidly constructed new
buildings they are so proud of.

15:52.851 --> 15:53.551
Stop!

15:53.711 --> 15:56.469
They are without any constraints.

15:56.511 --> 15:57.546
Don't move,
asshole!

15:57.991 --> 15:59.709
Leave her.

16:01.791 --> 16:03.224
Get lost.

16:15.771 --> 16:18.031
Urine.
Why don't you use urine?

16:20.511 --> 16:22.103
That's enough!

16:22.351 --> 16:23.300
No, seriously...

16:23.431 --> 16:25.547
Your urine is much too old.

16:26.831 --> 16:30.107
Back in Leningrad, I put my general
back on his feet with urine...

16:31.711 --> 16:33.303
You storyteller!

16:34.071 --> 16:35.299
It's true.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.109
What are they doing?

16:45.831 --> 16:46.786
Please!

16:47.511 --> 16:48.626
Please!

16:50.031 --> 16:52.261
Have you husband?

16:53.431 --> 16:55.467
A husband and two children.

17:00.471 --> 17:03.224
Come anyway.

17:03.831 --> 17:08.461
Quick, quick!
Let me through! Let me through!

17:12.031 --> 17:14.864
No, no, you pigs.

17:14.991 --> 17:17.710
You pigs! No!

17:18.911 --> 17:22.869
- You don't belong here.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

17:22.930 --> 17:23.930
Stop.

17:23.991 --> 17:27.470
You filthy pigs, leave me alone!
Come on, don't be so prude.

17:27.590 --> 17:31.470
Most fellow countrymen adeptly
saved their own hides.

17:31.591 --> 17:35.106
The girl from Silesia was easy prey.

17:35.531 --> 17:36.546
Leave!

17:37.911 --> 17:39.867
Mrs. Hitler.

17:43.751 --> 17:45.309
You slut! Where to?

17:45.391 --> 17:46.949
To the Fuhrer?

17:50.111 --> 17:53.899
Here. Quick.
Penthouse to the right. Quick! Go!

17:56.591 --> 17:59.310
Take this and go! Go!

17:59.591 --> 18:00.626
Come.

18:04.551 --> 18:08.783
You speak Russian.
You can't abandon me like that.

18:15.831 --> 18:16.866
Soldier!

18:23.631 --> 18:25.747
Why are you taking a woman...

18:26.631 --> 18:28.701
who doesn't want you?

18:29.871 --> 18:31.702
Willing women are unclean.

18:52.111 --> 18:54.750
Open the door! Open it!

18:54.871 --> 18:57.829
Open the door,
you bastards! Open it!

19:36.751 --> 19:38.582
Not here.

20:01.511 --> 20:04.469
- Where?
- Almost there.

20:11.071 --> 20:13.983
Stop! Stay where you are!

20:17.991 --> 20:19.265
Hey you.

20:19.391 --> 20:20.744
Shoo shoo!

20:26.151 --> 20:27.584
Commander...

20:28.111 --> 20:29.590
I am looking for
the commanding officer.

20:29.751 --> 20:31.343
What's up?

20:32.711 --> 20:34.349
Are you in charge here?

20:34.711 --> 20:37.464
I... we need help.

20:43.791 --> 20:45.782
Are you in charge here?

20:47.111 --> 20:50.183
There are many in charge here.
Everybody is in charge.

20:51.671 --> 20:52.786
Which one do you want?

20:56.071 --> 20:57.550
Major, sir...

20:59.151 --> 21:01.711
We need your help...

21:03.791 --> 21:06.703
Our men are all healthy and clean.

21:31.031 --> 21:32.987
Mrs. Hitler.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.584
Our country is finished.

21:37.591 --> 21:41.186
Gerd, do you remember your first words?

21:41.311 --> 21:46.590
"Give me 30 minutes and you will
never want to leave me again."

21:48.431 --> 21:50.422
God almighty.

22:50.271 --> 22:54.150
- That is the back corridor.
- The widow offered me a place to stay.

22:54.271 --> 22:59.345
She took me by the hand and just led me
inside her undestroyed apartment.

23:01.351 --> 23:08.063
- I gratefully accepted the offer.
- You can stay here for a while.

23:08.431 --> 23:14.267
Moving places was easy: a blouse,
a few books and notebooks.

23:14.711 --> 23:18.590
- You are welcome to stay.
- Thank you, I'll take your offer.

23:30.751 --> 23:33.584
Take good care of yourself.

23:38.391 --> 23:42.350
In spite of everything, it would have
been good to have a closer look around.

23:42.911 --> 23:48.065
But then, we never know everything,
so that's how the story continued.

24:02.911 --> 24:05.744
I guess it has been
really nice here once.

24:07.751 --> 24:11.141
How did you find me here?

24:12.591 --> 24:15.549
I searched every cellar.

24:31.191 --> 24:33.147
How often?

24:39.591 --> 24:40.660
Often.

24:46.511 --> 24:47.864
The shores are clad in green,

24:47.911 --> 24:50.379
the trees are breathing
freely and deeply

24:50.511 --> 24:52.661
We bravely stride on and on,

24:52.991 --> 24:55.021
towards the final assault
in this war!

24:56.831 --> 24:58.742
Our path was long to reach
this day in May.

24:58.871 --> 25:01.260
It has cost us much
strength and courage.

25:01.431 --> 25:03.706
But now we are free again!

25:03.871 --> 25:06.749
We proudly take our positions.

25:07.871 --> 25:08.986
Greetings, May.

25:10.831 --> 25:15.426
Our soldiers and a few American weapons,
and those would be history.

25:15.427 --> 25:15.780
Yeah.

25:28.151 --> 25:31.103
Yesterday at the water pump,
it was my turn,

25:31.104 --> 25:32.349
a guy approaches me,

25:33.551 --> 25:38.147
two Iron Crosses and one German
Cross in Gold on his chest,

25:38.271 --> 25:42.230
and he gallantly takes the buckets
out of my hands. And I say:

25:42.351 --> 25:48.347
"How do I deserve this honor?"
and he says "We can't give up now"

25:48.951 --> 25:52.546
"because if the Russian
even remotely does to us

25:52.671 --> 25:56.550
"what we did to them
during the last four years,

25:57.271 --> 26:00.820
"in the near future there won't
be any living Germans left."

26:04.031 --> 26:06.989
"In the near future"?
Nobody talks like that.

26:13.671 --> 26:19.303
Hey you Slavs!
We're in Berlin! We made it!

26:31.871 --> 26:36.547
How do you say: Excuse me,
do you have a dictionary?

26:37.511 --> 26:41.584
I guess he doesn't need a
dictionary for what he wants.

26:56.191 --> 26:57.180
Lenchen!

27:08.551 --> 27:10.507
Come with us!

27:10.831 --> 27:13.061
Come where?

27:14.311 --> 27:15.300
Lenchen!

27:15.431 --> 27:19.219
During the next few days,
our house was raided day and night.

27:19.351 --> 27:21.103
Lenchen!

27:21.591 --> 27:25.789
One woman hanged herself,
another one was shot to death.

27:25.911 --> 27:28.061
None of us was spared.

27:28.191 --> 27:31.149
Every emotion is dead.

27:31.551 --> 27:32.620
Hey, you from Berlin!

27:32.711 --> 27:35.020
Over here! Upstairs.
What kept you so long?

27:35.111 --> 27:38.148
Berlin is ours.
Germany is ours.

27:38.511 --> 27:39.944
Forever!

27:40.431 --> 27:41.944
Lenchen.

27:44.271 --> 27:47.229
- What have you got there?
- A map.

27:54.871 --> 27:56.389
Move it! Faster.

27:56.551 --> 27:58.189
You go left,
I go right.

28:06.831 --> 28:09.140
Where are you going?
Come to us.

28:14.191 --> 28:15.544
Come.

28:17.431 --> 28:21.822
Wake up, damned of the earth,
who are living in hunger and misery.

28:21.951 --> 28:26.103
Justice is about to burst through
like glowing magma in a volcano.

28:43.551 --> 28:46.543
You just go away, away!

28:56.551 --> 28:57.950
I!

29:11.911 --> 29:13.471
I...

29:13.571 --> 29:15.223
...love...

29:15.791 --> 29:17.747
...you.

29:49.431 --> 29:51.422
Good day.

30:04.431 --> 30:06.387
Please, don't!

30:15.151 --> 30:18.461
My pretty one.
I'll be back.

30:21.591 --> 30:23.786
My pretty one...

31:10.191 --> 31:12.466
I am a young man...

31:17.191 --> 31:19.546
You scared me.

31:53.151 --> 31:55.984
We will survive all this,

31:59.151 --> 32:01.381
by any means necessary.

32:43.951 --> 32:45.509
Where to?

32:46.351 --> 32:47.784
We're here.

32:55.151 --> 32:56.345
Who are you looking for?

32:59.271 --> 33:02.104
- Kommandatura?
- Kommandatura.

33:05.271 --> 33:09.822
So where are they now,
our saviors, all the great armies?

33:10.311 --> 33:14.185
In the past, war and dying
was a male exclusive thing.

33:14.186 --> 33:16.227
But those times are long gone.

33:17.031 --> 33:20.819
Damned Russians. Officer, General,
Commander, doesn't matter.

33:20.951 --> 33:23.909
I take everyone,
as high in rank as possible.

33:24.111 --> 33:27.069
From now on,
I will decide who gets me.

33:29.111 --> 33:33.741
No, no. Get out of there, will you?
This is still my bed.

33:34.311 --> 33:38.270
You can protect us from over there
on the couch, see? Protect.

33:38.711 --> 33:42.260
Hm? See.
You don't have to get under my blanket.

33:43.671 --> 33:46.504
Do you understand?

34:23.630 --> 34:24.699
Where is the Major?

34:24.751 --> 34:26.389
Wait.

34:31.311 --> 34:32.346
Hey, Miss.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.029
Who are you looking for?

34:36.271 --> 34:37.391
You, blondie.

34:37.491 --> 34:39.699
Why are you looking so stern?

34:47.551 --> 34:48.779
You!

34:48.871 --> 34:51.943
Could you soap my back, huh?

35:20.951 --> 35:23.784
Who do you want to talk to?

35:25.551 --> 35:27.542
You.

35:31.911 --> 35:34.379
Dismissed.

35:49.631 --> 35:52.464
May I have a seat?

35:53.151 --> 35:54.220
No.

36:08.711 --> 36:14.866
Yesterday our house has been occupied
and many women have been raped.

36:18.991 --> 36:22.267
I know nothing of that.

36:25.151 --> 36:28.109
It is your duty to help us.

36:37.551 --> 36:38.540
Who?

36:39.951 --> 36:41.066
My people...

36:41.191 --> 36:42.863
...or yours?

36:46.751 --> 36:47.820
Me.

36:58.911 --> 37:02.506
That's just a few minutes.
That's nothing to worry about.

37:14.071 --> 37:16.631
It's pointless.

37:19.231 --> 37:22.860
You Russian? Looking what?

37:24.031 --> 37:26.784
Who are you looking for?
Commanding officer?

37:29.671 --> 37:32.469
They are all with their women.
But I can do it too.

37:33.151 --> 37:34.504
Lieutenant, sir.

37:34.591 --> 37:35.990
May I have a word?

37:38.391 --> 37:41.349
Some of the balconies in
our house are mined.

37:41.991 --> 37:44.459
Could you help?

37:54.671 --> 37:55.820
Pity.

37:59.631 --> 38:01.223
Miss!

38:06.591 --> 38:08.741
You, I, evening?

38:09.991 --> 38:10.980
Hm?

38:16.911 --> 38:18.867
I Anatol.

38:19.551 --> 38:22.782
You, I, simple as that, huh?

38:24.671 --> 38:28.061
At this moment I made a vow,

38:28.191 --> 38:32.742
that nothing and nobody would
touch me, no matter what happened.

38:34.111 --> 38:37.023
Come in.
Follow.

38:37.471 --> 38:39.701
That's where I live.

38:39.791 --> 38:41.861
Come on in.

38:43.831 --> 38:47.790
You need to go now, understand?
Go back to your buddies.

38:52.751 --> 38:53.900
Well...

38:55.191 --> 38:57.751
That's my husband.

38:59.191 --> 39:02.024
Don't you understand?

39:03.111 --> 39:05.386
My husband.

39:06.471 --> 39:09.031
You must understand that.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.541
All humans are bad.

39:15.991 --> 39:20.382
I never get what he's saying.
He just won't leave.

39:27.511 --> 39:30.469
What are doing?
That is mahogany.

39:30.831 --> 39:33.550
Relax.
Go into the kitchen.

39:34.551 --> 39:38.510
To the 215th Rifles!

39:41.351 --> 39:42.391
To victory!

39:42.391 --> 39:43.790
To us.

39:46.951 --> 39:48.907
I Charkov!

39:49.231 --> 39:50.311
He's from Charkov.

39:50.471 --> 39:54.230
Charkov! Ah!
I'm industrial accountant in books.

39:54.551 --> 39:56.382
An accountant?
You're kidding me.

39:56.551 --> 40:00.464
I accountant! You accountant!
We accountant!

40:04.791 --> 40:05.780
Everything fine.

40:05.831 --> 40:08.265
That's life, you see?

40:08.471 --> 40:09.620
You, pretty.

40:10.311 --> 40:14.270
Ain't they great guys, those Russians?
They are full of juice and strength.

40:14.631 --> 40:18.226
The fucking war is really
pissing me off.

40:18.871 --> 40:19.940
True.

40:20.311 --> 40:22.222
When I get back to Charkov,

40:22.311 --> 40:24.461
I'll marry, build a house,

40:24.631 --> 40:26.223
get children.
I am working in the kolkhoz.

40:26.311 --> 40:28.620
and you, I will
take you as my accountant.

40:29.471 --> 40:31.621
Are you a professional soldier?

40:32.231 --> 40:33.631
No...

40:33.751 --> 40:35.781
I, dairy.

40:36.551 --> 40:39.111
Milk! Milk. Cow.

40:41.511 --> 40:47.222
- How very interesting.
- Interesting! Milk and milk.

40:49.551 --> 40:51.109
That's bullshit.

40:51.431 --> 40:52.830
Look at this.

40:53.831 --> 40:55.230
My trophies.

40:56.231 --> 40:57.789
That's nothing.

40:57.831 --> 40:59.025
Here.

40:59.711 --> 41:02.020
THAT is a trophy.

41:02.391 --> 41:03.790
That's not a trophy.

41:03.951 --> 41:05.982
Have a look at this.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.469
That...

41:08.711 --> 41:10.702
...that is a REAL trophy.

41:11.631 --> 41:13.110
An original.

41:13.791 --> 41:15.463
My present to all the ladies.

41:15.791 --> 41:17.388
To kiss and marvel about.

41:19.231 --> 41:20.551
Where toilet?

41:20.611 --> 41:22.945
- The toilet's on the corridor.
- Thanks.

41:49.991 --> 41:52.824
Would you like something to eat?

41:56.271 --> 41:57.465
You.

42:31.951 --> 42:33.464
You fancy my dick?

42:33.631 --> 42:35.383
Doesn't matter which one.

42:35.551 --> 42:36.950
Dick is dick.

42:42.351 --> 42:44.467
Why Russia?

42:48.231 --> 42:50.347
What were you doing there,
you sons of a bitch?

42:50.991 --> 42:52.947
Why Russia?

43:02.391 --> 43:06.350
That is Major...
afraid I forgot his name already.

43:15.351 --> 43:19.788
He is battalion commander. They don't
have commandants, only commanders.

43:20.071 --> 43:25.225
Did you know that they study
German as first foreign language?

43:25.871 --> 43:30.262
Well, it needs a war for us to
get this bit of information.

43:30.391 --> 43:33.224
Can I do something for you?

43:39.511 --> 43:42.821
Hey Mongol. Have you come
all the way from Moscow

43:42.951 --> 43:45.943
just to get some water
for a German woman?

43:46.031 --> 43:49.182
Or is our major bathing in rose essence?

43:59.791 --> 44:01.747
Made in Germany...

44:02.711 --> 44:04.588
I am taking care of the Major.

44:08.191 --> 44:10.231
Go now.
I'll catch up later.

44:10.531 --> 44:12.062
Go.

44:12.151 --> 44:14.984
Go, Mongol, go!

44:15.311 --> 44:19.224
Move it. Faster!
Go, go, go!

44:19.431 --> 44:21.308
Move it already.
Faster.

44:27.311 --> 44:32.749
A bomb hit the garden of the neighbors
and the whole house was rubble.

44:33.151 --> 44:38.305
And it blasted the fattened
sow up till under the roof.

44:39.791 --> 44:42.749
Well, obviously it was spoiled.

44:49.871 --> 44:51.384
Here.

44:54.711 --> 44:56.030
Give it to me.

45:05.391 --> 45:06.790
My apologies...

45:06.911 --> 45:08.424
for my unsuitable behavior.

45:08.551 --> 45:09.984
Dismissed.

45:34.711 --> 45:35.905
Berlin is ours.

45:36.271 --> 45:37.829
There.

45:49.351 --> 45:52.900
I have told everybody
that they needed to go.

45:56.471 --> 45:59.304
May I sit down?

46:06.911 --> 46:09.471
Come here.

46:10.631 --> 46:12.622
As you wish.

46:46.511 --> 46:47.580
No?

47:12.311 --> 47:17.021
The raping process continues.
They are everywhere.

47:18.111 --> 47:20.420
In every apartment.

47:20.551 --> 47:23.748
We are Russian property now.
At their service.

47:24.031 --> 47:27.785
But us women, we will need to
keep our mouths shut,

47:27.911 --> 47:32.114
or no man will ever want to touch
us again when this is all over.

47:32.115 --> 47:32.302
Poor Germany.

47:41.271 --> 47:44.183
German fighters: sit!

48:20.711 --> 48:24.624
Four. Four women.

48:26.031 --> 48:28.386
The whole of Berlin is a brothel.

48:33.191 --> 48:34.829
Here.
That's what I've found.

48:35.151 --> 48:36.789
They've got everything.

48:37.071 --> 48:38.823
They've got jewelry
and money and houses.

48:39.231 --> 48:41.426
And yet they go to war!
Scoundrels.

48:42.151 --> 48:43.869
Enough.

48:47.871 --> 48:50.704
What do I care about them?

48:51.951 --> 48:56.547
Sometimes I think that from now on
I could endure everything imaginable,

48:56.671 --> 48:59.108
as long as it comes from the outside

48:59.109 --> 49:02.223
and not from deep within
my treacherous heart.

49:04.431 --> 49:09.983
I am swell.
And my Russian is improving.

49:20.311 --> 49:23.144
- Is there anyone?
- Nobody.

49:43.111 --> 49:44.464
A welcome committee.

49:45.951 --> 49:48.704
Madam, I brought you a cavalier.

49:52.911 --> 49:55.744
Anatol is a gypsy.

49:56.391 --> 50:00.350
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protection.

50:00.951 --> 50:03.101
My sun.

50:16.071 --> 50:18.141
Do you think...

50:18.471 --> 50:22.020
Do you think the Fuhrer has forsaken us?

50:22.231 --> 50:24.461
No. Never.

50:31.951 --> 50:33.066
Here.

50:35.031 --> 50:37.591
Is that all?

50:43.511 --> 50:46.344
My head is aching like crazy.

51:00.471 --> 51:04.384
- Where are you going?
- I'll get you some food.

51:04.511 --> 51:07.548
If that's the last thing
I'll do in my life.

51:15.791 --> 51:17.782
What about the Reichstag?
I don't give a shit about it.

51:17.871 --> 51:20.305
Fuck the Reichstag.

51:22.711 --> 51:26.101
Then he grabs me
and throws me on the bed.

51:27.791 --> 51:32.626
And suddenly, he gets so boring,
like a lapdog.

51:34.911 --> 51:38.745
Later, he complimented me.

51:38.871 --> 51:42.784
He said:
"Ukrainian women like this."

51:44.191 --> 51:46.751
"You, like this."

51:52.511 --> 51:56.186
He had really bad breath.

52:07.751 --> 52:12.541
- Oh. It's you.
- Good morning. We bring breakfast.

52:13.431 --> 52:17.185
The next morning, a few blocks
away the war was still raging,

52:17.311 --> 52:21.270
- the Major came with all his troops.
- Good morning.

52:22.271 --> 52:27.550
The widow, who loved bacon,
was busy as a bee.

52:29.231 --> 52:33.463
Mr. Eckart, our man of the home guard,
was all too happy to surrender.

52:34.423 --> 52:35.423
This way.

52:37.231 --> 52:40.268
- Russian horse.
- What's that?

52:42.791 --> 52:44.440
Sugar. We have sugar!

52:44.441 --> 52:47.660
And bacon and salami
and bread and butter.

52:47.791 --> 52:50.908
Great joy,
but not for everybody.

52:54.791 --> 52:56.429
Then came the cavalry.

52:56.511 --> 52:59.150
Fluttering coats, sabres ahead,
horses snuffling.

52:59.231 --> 53:00.380
When a horse is charging,

53:00.511 --> 53:03.150
that's an incredible force.

53:03.311 --> 53:06.348
The whole avalanche is
charging against the tank,

53:06.551 --> 53:09.668
against the artillery,
against all the machine guns -

53:09.831 --> 53:11.981
All kaput.

53:13.551 --> 53:14.779
You've had much more troops,

53:14.911 --> 53:16.629
but they just couldn't stand it.

53:16.751 --> 53:18.946
They dropped their weapons and fled.

53:19.047 --> 53:20.947
German soldiers, bah!

53:22.791 --> 53:24.224
Don't be so insensitive.

53:24.311 --> 53:25.300
We didn't start this war!

53:25.431 --> 53:26.791
Sit down.

53:26.891 --> 53:28.463
And stop insulting our host.

53:28.591 --> 53:30.070
Enough.

53:30.351 --> 53:32.307
I Caucasus.

53:32.551 --> 53:34.109
Caucasus, understand?

53:34.911 --> 53:36.867
Big mountain, so beautiful!

53:37.551 --> 53:40.190
Sun, blue sky.

53:41.071 --> 53:43.790
Nice dancing with women.

53:44.551 --> 53:47.941
As sweet as grapes.

53:48.791 --> 53:51.305
And Pushkin.
He had to live there in exile.

53:52.151 --> 53:54.824
Pushkin? Doesn't matter.
I want to go home.

53:55.311 --> 53:57.267
Go home, understand?

53:58.031 --> 54:00.181
I want to see my children
and my wife.

54:15.671 --> 54:17.389
See?
And all you can think of is "Pushkin."

54:19.711 --> 54:22.020
I want my wife.

54:22.031 --> 54:24.989
My wife. Understand?

54:29.431 --> 54:32.264
What do you know about fascism?

54:33.111 --> 54:34.669
Fascism?

54:41.191 --> 54:45.742
From ancient Rome, Latin "fascio", means a
"bundle of sticks", figuratively a league.

54:48.911 --> 54:49.980
To our host.

54:50.071 --> 54:50.991
Right.

54:51.091 --> 54:53.300
To a woman who is
quite obviously very bright.

54:53.631 --> 54:56.065
Just like you right now.
Very bright.

54:56.951 --> 54:58.430
But I am not a woman!

54:58.671 --> 55:01.629
To German-Russian friendship!

55:03.511 --> 55:05.229
Hurray!

55:08.471 --> 55:10.109
Everybody upstairs, quick!

55:10.391 --> 55:12.905
Hurry! Quick!

55:17.111 --> 55:19.386
Search all the apartments.

55:31.791 --> 55:33.861
Out. Out!

55:37.231 --> 55:41.986
You goddamn bastard!
You dick! You fucking dick!

55:44.351 --> 55:45.830
Stop it.

55:46.671 --> 55:47.945
Enough!

55:50.431 --> 55:51.420
You know Stalin's orders.

55:52.311 --> 55:53.710
Get lost.

55:53.991 --> 55:55.549
Really? What if I don't?

55:55.731 --> 55:57.667
Are you gonna shoot me?

56:00.671 --> 56:03.310
I'll kill you if I have to.

56:06.951 --> 56:09.226
He is acting on my orders.

56:10.151 --> 56:11.300
Stop!

56:11.391 --> 56:14.110
A young soldier has stolen food.

56:15.511 --> 56:16.864
He is armed.

56:19.631 --> 56:21.064
Who is living up there?

56:24.351 --> 56:26.148
Who is living there?

56:30.311 --> 56:32.222
Anybody living there?

56:33.711 --> 56:34.860
No.

56:35.951 --> 56:37.304
She's lying.

56:37.671 --> 56:39.229
Lying bitch.

56:39.751 --> 56:41.503
I spit on Germany.

56:42.111 --> 56:44.227
And on Berlin.

56:44.551 --> 56:47.623
We conquered it,
and I spit on it!

56:49.031 --> 56:51.022
Get out of my way.

57:14.831 --> 57:16.150
Don't move.

57:26.031 --> 57:29.103
I'll kill you, punk!

57:40.671 --> 57:47.065
Everyone in possession of fire
arms or hiding someone with guns

57:47.631 --> 57:51.306
will be executed immediately,
their houses destroyed.

58:10.831 --> 58:13.789
They will not forget this.

58:26.951 --> 58:29.909
Can I have something to drink?

59:28.631 --> 59:30.940
You need to get away from here.

59:46.311 --> 59:51.385
- What are you doing here?
- I won't go to Siberia.

01:01:25.711 --> 01:01:29.070
During the next few days,
the Major was here often.

01:01:29.071 --> 01:01:30.944
Great protection for everyone.

01:01:34.751 --> 01:01:39.381
In his coat he had tucked away candles
and cigars and plenty of gifts

01:01:39.511 --> 01:01:43.823
that the widow stashed away in her
kitchen cupboard as quickly as possible.

01:01:43.951 --> 01:01:46.909
On the whole,
the times were changing.

01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:59.260
Russians love to play Santa Claus.
We don't want to spoil it for them, do we?

01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:02.663
That is way too much.

01:02:06.511 --> 01:02:11.107
The major speaks sophisticated Russian
and told me more than I wanted to know.

01:02:11.631 --> 01:02:13.558
Now I know about his bank account,

01:02:13.759 --> 01:02:16.386
his parents and the
names of his brothers.

01:02:16.511 --> 01:02:21.266
Today you are our guest.
Please, take a seat.

01:02:22.431 --> 01:02:26.902
Such an old school cavalier.
I really like to touch him.

01:02:32.191 --> 01:02:35.024
The war continued.

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:38.530
While our men and husbands
were sent to Siberia,

01:02:38.751 --> 01:02:41.285
many of the women found protectors

01:02:41.386 --> 01:02:43.383
which made them a taboo
for the rest of the pack.

01:02:44.191 --> 01:02:47.421
Please hold it up.
That's a Singer.

01:02:47.422 --> 01:02:49.823
Almost there.
Hold it up. Up.

01:02:54.551 --> 01:02:55.996
In and out, in and out.

01:02:55.997 --> 01:02:58.510
It's like Grand Central Station in here.

01:03:00.791 --> 01:03:03.021
Mussolini is dead. Hanged.

01:03:03.111 --> 01:03:05.545
He deserved it.
One asshole less.

01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:08.304
Cheers!

01:03:22.191 --> 01:03:27.140
As soon as Andrej had left the house,
Anatol claimed his visiting rights.

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:33.107
I was afraid that the two top dogs
would meet and kill me one day.

01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:43.665
It's not that I could claim
that this Major is raping me.

01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:46.624
I am at his service.

01:03:46.871 --> 01:03:49.510
A whore? Maybe.

01:03:51.631 --> 01:03:55.340
I have met that kind of
woman only once in my life.

01:03:55.471 --> 01:03:59.350
People told me not to talk to
her because she was unsound.

01:03:59.471 --> 01:04:02.508
Whatever that means: unsound.

01:04:04.031 --> 01:04:05.987
Young woman!

01:04:13.191 --> 01:04:15.182
No way.

01:04:17.231 --> 01:04:19.187
Incredible.

01:04:19.951 --> 01:04:23.500
There she comes prancing
along as if nothing happened.

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:31.543
- How often?
- Four times. You?

01:04:35.351 --> 01:04:37.307
Come on.

01:04:39.271 --> 01:04:42.401
I can't believe I see you again.
You look well.

01:04:42.502 --> 01:04:43.444
So do you.

01:04:43.631 --> 01:04:46.240
Here. Quince jelly.
Real Bordeaux. Take it.

01:04:46.241 --> 01:04:47.544
You take that with you.

01:04:47.751 --> 01:04:50.396
Seems you are having
a good life here.

01:04:50.397 --> 01:04:52.905
That's one way to put it.
Come on.

01:04:54.111 --> 01:04:56.989
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.

01:04:57.111 --> 01:04:59.600
Elke's visit had cheered us all up.

01:04:59.601 --> 01:05:01.662
The Major is guarding us well

01:05:01.791 --> 01:05:04.081
so that we can drink his tea
without any disturbances.

01:05:04.182 --> 01:05:05.281
That feels so good.

01:05:05.351 --> 01:05:06.864
Where to?

01:05:07.631 --> 01:05:09.030
What do you care?

01:05:09.271 --> 01:05:10.465
You can't go in there.

01:05:10.711 --> 01:05:12.269
Who's in there?

01:05:17.151 --> 01:05:19.629
What a nice and yummy bloke that was.

01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:21.303
So I tell him:"Young man,

01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:25.902
"that gun there over your shoulder,
that might go off."

01:05:26.951 --> 01:05:29.784
And when I go up the stairs,

01:05:29.991 --> 01:05:33.700
on the second floor someone
rushes out of the apartment,

01:05:33.831 --> 01:05:36.623
grabs my hair and asks:
"You syphilis?"

01:05:36.624 --> 01:05:38.507
And I am in shock and I say:

01:05:38.631 --> 01:05:42.089
- "No, surely not."
- How dumb of you.

01:05:47.491 --> 01:05:48.797
How's your husband?

01:05:48.898 --> 01:05:50.479
He was there when it
happened the first time.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.750
He's been a bit confused ever since.

01:05:51.871 --> 01:05:55.705
- What do you say about our cavaliers?
- Pitiful.

01:05:56.031 --> 01:05:58.111
They are pretty unimaginative.

01:05:58.112 --> 01:05:59.706
It may be that at home,

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:03.619
they have the latest and greatest
socialist planned economy,

01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:06.750
...but their sex life
is that of Adam and Eve.

01:06:06.751 --> 01:06:08.984
That's what I told my husband, too.

01:06:09.831 --> 01:06:14.985
With all the food shortage,
a good husband isn't worth that much.

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:19.987
I guess a satisfactory sex
life depends on regular meals.

01:06:20.511 --> 01:06:23.458
For me, it's all
about a full stomach.

01:06:23.459 --> 01:06:24.970
No gifts, no sex!

01:06:29.191 --> 01:06:31.515
Heart, Pain, Love,
Sex Drive. To us!

01:06:31.516 --> 01:06:33.901
Who knows when we'll be
together again.

01:06:34.711 --> 01:06:37.544
All right, careful.
Hot, hot!

01:06:38.511 --> 01:06:40.491
That is apple streusel cake.

01:06:40.492 --> 01:06:43.460
Yeah, with crumbles,
and it's still steaming hot.

01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:48.703
# You, you are in my heart. #

01:06:48.951 --> 01:06:52.227
# You, you are on my mind. #

01:06:52.791 --> 01:06:55.732
# You, you cause me great pains, #

01:06:55.733 --> 01:06:59.105
# you don't know how much I love you. #

01:06:59.351 --> 01:07:00.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:05.745
# don't know how much I love you. #

01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:13.545
Not too much going on with our
Russian men right now, am I right?

01:07:13.671 --> 01:07:18.699
- They are so puny and powerless.
- The weak sex.

01:07:20.431 --> 01:07:23.389
Have you heard anything from Gerd?

01:07:24.671 --> 01:07:27.620
I've got a question concerning Syphilis.

01:07:27.621 --> 01:07:28.505
Oh my God.

01:07:29.511 --> 01:07:31.815
How do you know you've got it?

01:07:31.816 --> 01:07:34.426
Itching and burning.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:38.385
- And enlarged lymph nodes.
- But that comes later.

01:07:39.831 --> 01:07:42.664
I've read it in a lexicon.

01:07:49.871 --> 01:07:51.941
A lexicon...

01:07:54.431 --> 01:07:55.231
Here.

01:07:55.431 --> 01:07:57.267
An American gave that to me.

01:07:59.471 --> 01:08:01.109
Chew it.

01:08:03.351 --> 01:08:05.023
Good, isn't it?

01:08:06.351 --> 01:08:08.228
Americans...

01:08:10.271 --> 01:08:12.944
They all look like film stars.

01:08:23.711 --> 01:08:26.145
I'm leaving.

01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:28.710
And tell her...

01:08:29.751 --> 01:08:31.662
that I'll be back.

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:35.462
You got that?

01:08:43.791 --> 01:08:45.224
What's that?

01:08:59.911 --> 01:09:02.743
Can you protect us?

01:09:05.911 --> 01:09:08.470
Just this one day?

01:09:10.111 --> 01:09:12.147
I'll be here.

01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:30.622
Where will you go...
later?

01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:34.785
To where I am needed.

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:40.509
A special evening with the Major.

01:09:40.631 --> 01:09:42.906
Good conversation.

01:09:43.031 --> 01:09:44.832
He told me that he adores me.

01:09:44.834 --> 01:09:47.069
And that he doesn't care
about anything else.

01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:52.828
Other than the Germans, the Russian
men really appreciate educated women.

01:09:55.831 --> 01:09:59.062
But the war hasn't ended yet.

01:09:59.431 --> 01:10:00.455
Excuse me.

01:10:00.456 --> 01:10:05.984
Have you got a minute to spare?
We could use your help.

01:10:11.351 --> 01:10:13.391
Come on, kiddos,
let's get out of here.

01:10:13.392 --> 01:10:15.583
We will finish building
this tower of yours.

01:10:21.271 --> 01:10:23.307
That's him.

01:10:30.431 --> 01:10:31.466
Good day.

01:10:33.791 --> 01:10:35.907
You Russian?

01:10:37.911 --> 01:10:39.060
Translate.

01:10:56.271 --> 01:10:59.741
The German army came to my village

01:11:10.671 --> 01:11:12.980
and killed all the children.

01:11:17.511 --> 01:11:20.071
They have...

01:11:23.311 --> 01:11:24.539
...stabbed them to death,

01:11:32.791 --> 01:11:35.544
took their bodies at the ankles...

01:11:42.471 --> 01:11:43.540
Continue!

01:11:44.631 --> 01:11:46.542
...and smashed their skulls...

01:12:01.031 --> 01:12:03.829
...on the walls...

01:12:11.831 --> 01:12:13.230
...of the houses.

01:12:21.831 --> 01:12:23.867
Have you heard that?

01:12:24.031 --> 01:12:25.350
Or did you see it with your own eyes?

01:12:29.951 --> 01:12:31.942
I saw it.

01:12:41.951 --> 01:12:44.021
Hey! Why so fast?

01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:46.909
Have you forgotten your panties?

01:13:03.631 --> 01:13:08.546
You speak Russian,
so tell him he needs to stop that.

01:13:10.431 --> 01:13:13.264
You speak Russian, right?

01:13:22.871 --> 01:13:27.069
Move it, you slut!
Go.

01:14:04.631 --> 01:14:07.191
Where are you going?

01:14:08.751 --> 01:14:11.584
I've been waiting for you.

01:14:15.111 --> 01:14:18.069
What's wrong with you?

01:14:18.631 --> 01:14:21.099
Comrade Major!

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:32.589
The old Germany is coming to an end.

01:14:39.711 --> 01:14:41.906
Stay away from him!

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:43.869
He is coming to me,

01:14:44.151 --> 01:14:45.789
not the other way round.

01:14:46.751 --> 01:14:48.423
Go away.

01:14:48.671 --> 01:14:50.627
Why?

01:14:54.231 --> 01:14:57.029
You Germans have hanged his wife.

01:15:18.351 --> 01:15:25.348
Attention! On April 30th,
1945, the Fuhrer committed suicide.

01:15:26.911 --> 01:15:32.144
He deserted all of us who have
pledged allegiance to him.

01:15:33.711 --> 01:15:37.260
Following the orders of the Fuhrer,
you still believe it's your duty

01:15:37.831 --> 01:15:41.904
to defend Berlin although
the supply of heavy armory,

01:15:42.591 --> 01:15:47.585
ammunition and your position make
this fight utterly pointless.

01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:50.907
With every hour you continue to fight,

01:15:51.031 --> 01:15:56.185
you prolong the horrible suffering
of the civil population of Berlin...

01:15:56.391 --> 01:15:57.908
and our wounded soldiers.

01:15:57.909 --> 01:16:01.306
From now on, everybody who
dies in the battle for Berlin

01:16:02.271 --> 01:16:05.104
will have sacrificed
their lives in vain.

01:16:05.871 --> 01:16:10.706
In accordance with the leaders
of the Soviet army I prompt you

01:16:11.631 --> 01:16:14.782
to cease all fighting immediately.

01:16:16.511 --> 01:16:23.622
Breitling, Artillery General and
commanding officer of the Berlin defense.

01:16:34.871 --> 01:16:39.342
Fellow soldiers and officers
of the 8th guard army.

01:16:40.311 --> 01:16:42.029
This morning,

01:16:42.151 --> 01:16:43.948
the Berlin garrison...

01:16:43.991 --> 01:16:46.505
...has capitulated.

01:16:47.631 --> 01:16:49.189
Berlin...

01:16:51.031 --> 01:16:53.261
is defeated.

01:16:55.151 --> 01:16:56.709
I've told you we would make it!

01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:30.829
I'll join my fellow Germans.

01:18:32.351 --> 01:18:34.307
Go to Siberia?

01:18:37.711 --> 01:18:39.667
What about us?

01:18:54.631 --> 01:18:58.340
Talk to me, Friedrich, please!

01:18:59.391 --> 01:19:01.951
Talk to me.

01:19:04.271 --> 01:19:07.104
I've been waiting for you.

01:19:07.951 --> 01:19:10.784
I have prayed and hoped,

01:19:12.871 --> 01:19:16.102
prayed and hoped.

01:19:17.391 --> 01:19:19.951
No I want you to fulfill

01:19:20.471 --> 01:19:25.306
some of those hopes for me.

01:20:01.191 --> 01:20:06.219
Hurray, comrades!
To our victory!

01:20:06.511 --> 01:20:09.344
Berlin is defeated!

01:20:09.551 --> 01:20:12.588
To our home country!

01:20:16.671 --> 01:20:18.980
Long live the Red Army!

01:20:19.551 --> 01:20:23.942
Long live Stalin!

01:20:50.271 --> 01:20:53.229
Hold on, wait a second.

01:20:56.991 --> 01:20:59.949
What have we here?
Two halibuts.

01:21:02.471 --> 01:21:07.625
- That's incredible.
- Hitler, Goebbels, kaput.

01:21:10.871 --> 01:21:12.827
That's great!
Let's drink.

01:22:09.511 --> 01:22:11.866
Capitulation.

01:22:11.991 --> 01:22:14.824
The time has come.

01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:17.864
The war is over.

01:22:18.031 --> 01:22:22.007
Us women have been looking
forward to this day so much.

01:22:22.008 --> 01:22:22.149
So how does it feel?

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:25.229
Bitter, bitter defeat.

01:22:27.871 --> 01:22:32.422
More and more people report
gruesome things.

01:22:32.951 --> 01:22:37.502
I sense an alien, hard-to-grasp
something in the air,

01:22:39.271 --> 01:22:42.104
mean and threatening.

01:22:44.991 --> 01:22:48.188
I don't want to think
about that right now.

01:22:53.951 --> 01:22:55.907
It's over.

01:22:56.151 --> 01:22:57.869
I don't know...

01:22:58.591 --> 01:23:02.027
I'm afraid misfortune has still
some tricks up its sleeves.

01:23:16.511 --> 01:23:18.263
Do you hear that?

01:23:18.591 --> 01:23:21.549
They drink and smoke like men.

01:23:25.311 --> 01:23:28.860
There are 1 million women
in the Russian army.

01:23:30.471 --> 01:23:34.430
They come from everywhere.
We don't have uniforms for them.

01:23:35.231 --> 01:23:39.543
Boots are too big.
Shirts and jackets, a disaster.

01:23:41.111 --> 01:23:45.070
Once a woman came to me,
Ljuba was her name I think.

01:23:45.191 --> 01:23:49.821
She says: "Comrade Major,
I believe I will fall today.

01:23:50.311 --> 01:23:55.146
"I want new clothes." I say:
"No, you are with us a long time.

01:23:55.271 --> 01:23:59.662
"Bullets just avoid you."
Two hours later, she comes again.

01:23:59.791 --> 01:24:02.624
And again. Then I tell her:

01:24:03.631 --> 01:24:09.263
"Then the new shirt,
with ties white as snow,

01:24:10.511 --> 01:24:13.071
it would be spoiled by the blood."

01:24:14.751 --> 01:24:19.310
All female soldiers fear that when
they die, they don't look pretty.

01:24:23.777 --> 01:24:26.337
Are you a fascist?

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:38.246
What are you looking for?

01:24:38.377 --> 01:24:40.129
All occupied.

01:24:47.177 --> 01:24:49.930
And the battalion commander?

01:24:56.137 --> 01:24:58.605
That's what I like
about you Mongols.

01:25:00.257 --> 01:25:03.647
Not a single unnecessary word.

01:25:10.497 --> 01:25:12.533
1678 days...

01:25:12.617 --> 01:25:15.336
since I've been in this war.

01:25:21.097 --> 01:25:23.213
And now...

01:25:29.977 --> 01:25:31.888
And she...

01:25:32.937 --> 01:25:34.928
she's a whore.

01:25:35.097 --> 01:25:36.894
Am I right?

01:25:39.057 --> 01:25:40.615
This whole place...

01:25:40.697 --> 01:25:43.291
is a brothel!

01:26:32.137 --> 01:26:35.209
You come with me.
Move it, you pig.

01:26:38.097 --> 01:26:40.744
A pistol, huh? Bastard!

01:26:40.745 --> 01:26:42.010
Peace, huh?

01:26:42.257 --> 01:26:43.326
Don't!

01:26:46.457 --> 01:26:48.413
War kaput!

01:26:52.817 --> 01:26:54.170
I said, move it!

01:26:54.857 --> 01:26:55.846
Everybody downstairs.

01:26:57.457 --> 01:26:58.412
Hurry!

01:27:04.977 --> 01:27:06.296
All of you, downstairs.

01:27:06.897 --> 01:27:08.091
Hurry!

01:27:08.297 --> 01:27:09.810
Faster.

01:27:11.377 --> 01:27:12.366
Quick!

01:27:15.497 --> 01:27:17.408
Don't move.

01:27:19.737 --> 01:27:21.693
Where you get weapons?

01:27:27.257 --> 01:27:30.090
Whose apartment is that?

01:27:34.217 --> 01:27:35.172
Who?

01:27:36.617 --> 01:27:37.572
It's mine.

01:27:46.817 --> 01:27:48.091
Is that hers?

01:27:48.817 --> 01:27:50.136
It's hers.

01:27:50.977 --> 01:27:54.686
That is crime against
decree of Red Army.

01:27:55.617 --> 01:27:57.653
Long live the Fuhrer.

01:27:58.537 --> 01:28:00.129
Eliminate her.

01:28:01.017 --> 01:28:03.577
You can all go to hell.

01:28:06.817 --> 01:28:09.650
Did you know about weapons?

01:28:12.697 --> 01:28:15.973
- No.
- Go back to apartment.

01:28:16.537 --> 01:28:17.597
Shoot them all!

01:28:17.937 --> 01:28:18.993
Go now.

01:28:19.137 --> 01:28:20.057
Stop.

01:28:20.157 --> 01:28:21.775
They're liars, all of them!

01:28:21.976 --> 01:28:22.946
Shoot them.

01:28:26.337 --> 01:28:27.517
Leave this woman.

01:28:27.817 --> 01:28:28.897
She is a Hitler broad.

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.865
Do you understand?

01:28:30.966 --> 01:28:31.170
No.

01:28:32.177 --> 01:28:34.566
First she will be interrogated.

01:28:35.417 --> 01:28:37.350
Do you understand?

01:28:37.577 --> 01:28:38.817
What are you doing, brother?

01:28:39.817 --> 01:28:42.570
This woman has sheltered
an armed soldier.

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:44.057
The punishment for that is death.

01:28:44.197 --> 01:28:45.388
Go, now!

01:28:52.177 --> 01:28:54.930
I'll have to report this.

01:28:55.617 --> 01:28:58.529
Burn them alive!

01:29:05.897 --> 01:29:10.766
How could you risk our lives like that?
Now we are sold down the river.

01:29:38.057 --> 01:29:39.729
Traitor!

01:29:53.657 --> 01:29:58.936
I own whole Berlin! Hotel Adlon,
Wedding, Kaiserdamm!

01:29:59.417 --> 01:30:02.136
Red flags everywhere.

01:30:02.337 --> 01:30:05.613
Red flags.
Pretty flags, good quality.

01:30:08.177 --> 01:30:10.213
What is it?

01:30:13.937 --> 01:30:15.052
Quarrel?

01:30:26.537 --> 01:30:27.686
What are you looking at?

01:30:28.137 --> 01:30:29.968
Get out of my sight.

01:30:34.297 --> 01:30:35.332
Hey, what's up?

01:30:36.297 --> 01:30:37.366
To victory, Commander.

01:30:38.057 --> 01:30:39.729
To Stalin and our victory.

01:30:40.297 --> 01:30:41.616
Wait.
You should stay with your people.

01:30:41.897 --> 01:30:43.808
The war is over.

01:30:45.617 --> 01:30:47.812
Here! I get it.

01:30:48.577 --> 01:30:49.977
Look...

01:30:50.177 --> 01:30:52.047
Lyoba, Marina, Olga.

01:30:54.577 --> 01:30:55.726
They love me,

01:30:56.577 --> 01:30:57.976
all of them.

01:30:59.257 --> 01:31:01.213
Everything all right?

01:31:03.657 --> 01:31:05.613
Do you want something to eat?

01:31:17.377 --> 01:31:23.532
Here. What's better? You tell me.
His dick or my bicycle?

01:31:25.617 --> 01:31:26.652
And you, get out of here...

01:31:26.777 --> 01:31:28.495
before I shoot your nuts off!

01:31:30.537 --> 01:31:31.577
You, listen!

01:31:32.017 --> 01:31:33.198
We celebrate.

01:31:33.399 --> 01:31:35.541
Everybody come, whole house.

01:31:35.542 --> 01:31:36.286
Order!

01:31:38.377 --> 01:31:42.575
Your Hitler is not human.
He is a stinking pile of turd.

01:31:44.737 --> 01:31:45.806
Not human.

01:31:46.417 --> 01:31:47.611
Turd!

01:31:49.017 --> 01:31:51.424
Lenchen, Lenchen!
Trouble upstairs!

01:31:51.425 --> 01:31:53.488
Everyone, come now.

01:31:54.577 --> 01:31:55.566
Order!

01:31:57.537 --> 01:31:58.765
Fill the glasses.

01:31:59.337 --> 01:32:00.565
What are you standing there?

01:32:00.657 --> 01:32:02.249
We've got guests.

01:32:13.097 --> 01:32:15.053
Why fear?

01:32:26.337 --> 01:32:29.488
Look down there.
What do you see?

01:32:31.897 --> 01:32:33.250
Soldiers.

01:32:34.817 --> 01:32:38.366
Russians! Beasts.
Or animals, like you call us.

01:32:39.497 --> 01:32:41.453
And you're right.

01:32:41.577 --> 01:32:47.652
None of us is hesitating a single
second if we can shoot a German.

01:32:48.777 --> 01:32:52.008
Your blood is on our uniforms.

01:32:52.377 --> 01:32:55.449
Is good as it is.
None of them wanted war!

01:32:56.777 --> 01:33:00.565
Most of them didn't even
know what that is, Germany.

01:33:04.137 --> 01:33:07.049
Now come with me.

01:33:11.417 --> 01:33:13.407
What is happening here?

01:33:13.408 --> 01:33:15.569
Careful, that's mahogany.

01:33:16.417 --> 01:33:18.851
Let me go!

01:33:23.057 --> 01:33:26.493
- You dance. Dance!
- How dare you?

01:33:26.617 --> 01:33:29.880
This is my living room
and not a dance hall.

01:33:29.881 --> 01:33:30.895
You understand?

01:33:31.057 --> 01:33:34.015
- That is fantastic.
- No dance hall!

01:33:34.297 --> 01:33:37.846
Drink Schnapps, Vodka.
Schnapps good.

01:33:41.217 --> 01:33:42.286
You.

01:33:50.097 --> 01:33:53.931
Sing? Now he wants me to sing.
I won't sing now.

01:33:55.617 --> 01:33:58.575
- What does he want?
- Well, have a guess.

01:33:59.137 --> 01:34:00.092
No.

01:34:00.297 --> 01:34:01.730
What does that mean, "no"?

01:34:04.057 --> 01:34:06.969
That is Europe!
That is Europe!

01:34:07.617 --> 01:34:08.970
Drink, drink.

01:34:10.897 --> 01:34:11.937
Why not?

01:34:12.137 --> 01:34:14.007
I'm looking at you.

01:34:14.057 --> 01:34:16.127
And you?
Nothing.

01:34:22.297 --> 01:34:23.810
Well, maybe next time.

01:34:24.737 --> 01:34:25.886
To you.

01:34:40.937 --> 01:34:42.928
I Anatol.

01:34:44.617 --> 01:34:47.450
- I know.
- Bärbel.

01:34:48.377 --> 01:34:53.053
My heart calls Bärbel.

01:34:54.337 --> 01:34:57.374
Bärbel, Bärbel, Bärbel.

01:35:09.257 --> 01:35:11.373
I play the fiddle.

01:35:11.497 --> 01:35:13.533
Violin. Violin?

01:35:14.177 --> 01:35:15.769
You play the piano?

01:35:15.857 --> 01:35:18.083
In an orchestra,
but not any more.

01:35:18.084 --> 01:35:19.327
The violin is lost.

01:35:19.897 --> 01:35:22.730
That's good.
I'd like to play the piano, too.

01:35:28.897 --> 01:35:31.730
Why don't you go upstairs?

01:35:32.417 --> 01:35:36.888
- Should I?
- Yes, have some fun.

01:35:39.897 --> 01:35:42.730
We all need that.

01:35:43.377 --> 01:35:45.937
Do you come with me?

01:35:46.097 --> 01:35:47.325
Later.

01:35:48.817 --> 01:35:50.808
- Sure?
- Yes.

01:35:56.977 --> 01:35:59.810
It's good that you are here.

01:36:18.417 --> 01:36:20.885
I want to embrace you

01:36:21.017 --> 01:36:23.577
my whole life.

01:36:26.297 --> 01:36:29.130
I am here, you're in Moscow.

01:36:31.217 --> 01:36:34.050
Nobody has arms that long.

01:36:34.737 --> 01:36:36.693
Try it.

01:36:43.457 --> 01:36:48.485
The Major asked me to call him Andrej.
"Why not?", I said.

01:36:48.617 --> 01:36:52.576
"The war is over."
He looked at me for a long while.

01:36:53.817 --> 01:36:57.776
"Every newborn child
cries for war," he said.

01:36:58.457 --> 01:37:03.008
Nothing and nobody, no man,
no nation, will stop this vicious circle.

01:37:03.977 --> 01:37:05.933
Only death.

01:37:13.857 --> 01:37:16.815
Not so fast,
I am getting sick.

01:37:22.577 --> 01:37:24.295
Gee.

01:37:27.137 --> 01:37:28.570
Attention.

01:37:30.777 --> 01:37:32.972
And now for everybody...

01:37:33.337 --> 01:37:36.568
"I in love with you."

01:37:38.777 --> 01:37:40.005
Bärbel.

01:38:10.057 --> 01:38:11.570
Dance.

01:38:16.737 --> 01:38:18.967
Come on, let's go.

01:38:26.257 --> 01:38:30.136
We are not a people any more,
we're only "the population".

01:38:30.257 --> 01:38:34.011
I am talking about individuals
that form within a democracy.

01:38:34.137 --> 01:38:38.096
The ones who get the economy going.
Economic upswing.

01:39:03.897 --> 01:39:06.730
Dance, dance, you come.

01:39:11.257 --> 01:39:14.071
I think we should look at
the greater picture here.

01:39:14.072 --> 01:39:16.615
The countries of Europe
will burst their borders.

01:39:16.737 --> 01:39:20.650
They will grow into larger areas.
The victorious super powers will,

01:39:20.777 --> 01:39:23.735
just like Napoleon did,
re-order the political world map.

01:39:24.097 --> 01:39:28.329
So we will become a Soviet republic
with planned economy, huh?

01:39:40.777 --> 01:39:41.812
Thanks.

01:39:44.377 --> 01:39:48.256
Well, Mr. Hoch, everything all right?
We need to think practical now.

01:39:48.377 --> 01:39:52.211
Let's start the every day life again,
and we will soon get into the groove.

01:39:55.737 --> 01:39:56.692
Slow down.

01:40:18.857 --> 01:40:20.006
Drink.

01:40:31.617 --> 01:40:34.051
The Soviet Union is just at
the beginning of its evolution.

01:40:35.257 --> 01:40:37.817
The future will prove that.

01:40:40.737 --> 01:40:43.126
You love your country.

01:40:43.897 --> 01:40:46.172
Just as I love mine.

01:40:54.417 --> 01:40:57.250
My mother once said that one day,

01:40:57.737 --> 01:41:01.571
I would marry a man
who played the piano.

01:41:09.857 --> 01:41:13.247
Everybody has been wondering
what this day would be like.

01:41:15.377 --> 01:41:17.572
I haven't.

01:41:18.577 --> 01:41:20.932
Never.

01:41:28.817 --> 01:41:32.207
I didn't want to experience it.

01:41:37.737 --> 01:41:40.774
Why not?

01:41:55.417 --> 01:41:59.933
If you don't do it, Andrej,
I will tell you something.

01:42:05.417 --> 01:42:09.535
War is changing the words.

01:42:13.977 --> 01:42:19.097
"Love" is not what it used to be.

01:42:25.577 --> 01:42:27.533
And yet,

01:42:31.097 --> 01:42:33.657
in spite of that,

01:42:34.817 --> 01:42:39.175
I want that my husband finds the
same wife that he left behind

01:42:39.217 --> 01:42:41.650
when he returns.

01:42:46.937 --> 01:42:48.893
Please stay.

01:43:09.657 --> 01:43:13.616
Us women,
we are branded for life.

01:43:15.017 --> 01:43:19.249
But for here and now,
right in this moment,

01:43:20.617 --> 01:43:23.575
I feel fantastic.

01:43:32.377 --> 01:43:35.335
I'll go and get us some tea.
Ilse still has some left.

01:44:10.817 --> 01:44:14.412
Morning, Lenchen!
Anybody up?

01:44:20.537 --> 01:44:23.495
- Where is your Wanja?
- Working.

01:44:24.697 --> 01:44:26.653
And mummy?

01:44:31.937 --> 01:44:32.972
Ilse?

01:44:34.857 --> 01:44:35.812
Ilse?

01:44:39.017 --> 01:44:40.575
Ilse?

01:44:57.257 --> 01:44:58.656
Ilse.

01:44:59.977 --> 01:45:02.537
Ilse, get away from him.

01:45:17.417 --> 01:45:20.295
Gerd, do you remember?
It was on a Tuesday.

01:45:20.417 --> 01:45:22.851
We went to see Felix.

01:45:22.977 --> 01:45:25.935
You could smell the tree resin.

01:45:26.537 --> 01:45:30.496
We came across a cloud of butterflies.

01:45:32.537 --> 01:45:35.495
And you knew all their names.

01:45:35.937 --> 01:45:42.206
Pea blues, Brimstones, Fire birds,
Swallowtails and many more.

01:45:46.977 --> 01:45:49.663
One was taking a sunbath
right there on the path,

01:45:49.664 --> 01:45:51.812
it was velvety brown and
yellow with a blue hem.

01:45:52.417 --> 01:45:55.375
You called it a Mourning Cloak.

01:46:22.977 --> 01:46:26.535
So many things I've
been given in my life.

01:46:26.536 --> 01:46:27.528
In abundance.

01:46:27.657 --> 01:46:30.615
The Major had lost everything.

01:46:30.897 --> 01:46:33.775
Damn Russian idealist.

01:46:33.897 --> 01:46:37.776
He takes it all like he
wants the world to be.

01:46:37.897 --> 01:46:40.730
Soviet apostle.

01:46:43.337 --> 01:46:44.831
I like him though.

01:46:44.932 --> 01:46:48.650
The less he wants from me,
the more I like him.

01:46:50.257 --> 01:46:51.326
Very much.

01:46:59.497 --> 01:47:00.566
Andrej.

01:47:02.977 --> 01:47:03.966
Andrej.

01:47:33.817 --> 01:47:36.650
Andrej isn't here any more.

01:47:38.377 --> 01:47:39.890
Relocated.

01:47:46.417 --> 01:47:47.486
To where?

01:47:52.297 --> 01:47:53.696
Unknown.

01:47:56.057 --> 01:47:57.331
Good-bye.

01:48:57.937 --> 01:49:00.895
"The birds so quiet,
the bells are silent."

01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:04.250
(from "18 Little Songs of the
Bitter Homeland" by Yiannis Ritsos)

01:49:04.697 --> 01:49:07.257
Isn't that how it goes?

01:49:24.457 --> 01:49:25.731
Please, sit down.

01:49:51.177 --> 01:49:53.213
The studio,

01:49:55.057 --> 01:49:57.013
is that gone?

01:50:09.817 --> 01:50:12.775
- I don't live here alone.
- I know.

01:50:16.617 --> 01:50:19.085
Ukrainians like that.

01:51:10.057 --> 01:51:12.890
Here, that's for you.

01:52:17.137 --> 01:52:19.697
You are shameless.

01:52:20.017 --> 01:52:22.577
Don't you see that?

01:52:26.017 --> 01:52:29.566
It is disgusting
just to look at you.

01:53:27.817 --> 01:53:29.045
Atten-shun!

01:54:02.337 --> 01:54:05.374
- I'd like to thank you.
- For what?

01:54:08.697 --> 01:54:11.655
That I had the chance
to get to know you.

01:54:20.777 --> 01:54:23.610
Take care of yourself.

01:54:39.337 --> 01:54:42.215
How are we supposed to live?

01:55:15.657 --> 01:55:17.648
Eyes front!

01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:34.494
"Relocation," that's what they call it.

01:55:36.257 --> 01:55:39.090
With full honors and merits.

01:55:39.217 --> 01:55:42.687
To Siberia, who knows?

01:56:03.977 --> 01:56:05.330
Gerd.

01:56:06.377 --> 01:56:09.210
My beloved Gerd.

01:56:10.017 --> 01:56:12.815
What shall we do?

01:56:12.937 --> 01:56:15.451
Turn back the wheel of time?

01:56:15.577 --> 01:56:18.535
Back to your very first words?

01:56:19.857 --> 01:56:22.690
"30 minutes", you said.

01:56:26.697 --> 01:56:32.329
"Give me 30 minutes, and you will
never want to leave me again."

01:59:03.857 --> 01:59:04.812
What?

01:59:18.977 --> 01:59:20.046
What?

01:59:26.777 --> 01:59:29.337
No answer.

01:59:30.057 --> 01:59:33.015
Two days later he was gone.

01:59:33.457 --> 01:59:36.335
I don't know if he will come back.

01:59:36.457 --> 01:59:39.899
I am surprised that I am
not suffering more.

01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:40.894
Maybe I am just too busy.

01:59:41.777 --> 01:59:45.326
I need to find a piece of flint stone,

01:59:45.457 --> 01:59:48.443
I need to mop up the
floor of the apartment

01:59:48.444 --> 01:59:51.293
and I am desperately
looking for some flowers.

01:59:51.417 --> 01:59:54.250
Yesterday I found some lilac.

01:59:55.457 --> 01:59:58.290
I wonder if Gerd still thinks about me.

01:59:58.497 --> 02:00:00.453
Who knows?

02:00:00.617 --> 02:00:02.942
Maybe our hearts have
a say in this, too,

02:00:03.143 --> 02:00:06.447
and we'll see each other again,
some day.

02:00:09.457 --> 02:00:13.683
When the diary "A woman in Berlin"
was first released in Germany in 1959,

02:00:13.784 --> 02:00:15.257
it was a huge scandal.

02:00:15.317 --> 02:00:19.487
Many people said that it was a disgrace
and an insult to the German women.

02:00:19.757 --> 02:00:23.355
The author was so shocked by
the rejection and the contempt
that her book received.

02:00:23.856 --> 02:00:27.356
She prohibited any further
releases for as long as she lived.

02:00:27.757 --> 02:00:30.457
And even beyond her death,
here real name was never to be revealed.
