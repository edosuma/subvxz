00:01.167 --> 00:02.164
Previously on The O.C.:

00:02.335 --> 00:04.496
-What are you doing here?
-I ain't here to work.

00:04.671 --> 00:07.333
-Came to see my girlfriend.
-You are an ignorant buffoon.

00:07.507 --> 00:10.340
-Aren't you staying for midnight?
-Your mom has a headache.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.535
-Have Bullit give you a ride.
-ln my dream...

00:12.912 --> 00:16.177
...I had found my other half...

00:16.349 --> 00:17.714
...and it was an otter.

00:17.884 --> 00:19.476
Tell me about your spirit animal.

00:19.652 --> 00:21.313
-lt was an otter.
-An otter?

00:21.488 --> 00:23.422
When Henri-Michel told me he loved me...

00:23.590 --> 00:26.320
...it was like the whole world
melted away.

00:26.493 --> 00:27.653
So, what are you saying?

00:27.827 --> 00:31.456
I don't think I should be with anyone.
Bye, Ryan.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.605
-Hello.
-Taylor, where are you?

00:45.779 --> 00:48.942
-I thought you were gonna come to dinner.
-Just go on without me.

00:49.115 --> 00:52.346
-I haven't finished my errands yet.
-Wait, you've been gone all day.

00:52.519 --> 00:54.885
I had to go to the dry cleaner,
get my nails done.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.888
-Go to the Matthew Barney Exhibition.
-Okay. Is Ryan with you?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.150
No, Kaitlin, I told you:

00:59.325 --> 01:02.453
We're giving each other some space.
We haven't spoken in a week.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.254
You're not going
to Kirsten's thing?

01:05.432 --> 01:08.128
-What thing?
-Her party. She's turning 40.

01:08.301 --> 01:11.828
I'd hoped you'd be there
to do something weird, so it's not boring.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.303
-Wait, do you want to know where it is?
-No.

01:14.474 --> 01:18.103
I don't. I have to go. Goodbye.

01:19.379 --> 01:20.812
-Excuse me, miss?
-Yes?

01:20.980 --> 01:24.074
You're making some of the owners
around here a little nervous.

01:24.250 --> 01:28.414
-Why? What are you talking about?
-You've been loitering here for seven hours.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.614
Loitering? What's loitering?
I've been just--

01:31.791 --> 01:33.850
What are you doing with those binoculars?

01:35.128 --> 01:38.291
These are for bird watching.

01:38.465 --> 01:41.457
-There's an oriole in that tree.
-I'll have to ask you to leave.

01:41.634 --> 01:45.161
Oh, but Ryan's off work in 1 0 minutes.
Can you just give me a-- 1 0 minutes?

01:45.338 --> 01:46.930
-You want a doughnut?
-No.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.368
-Hey, Taylor's not joining us?
-Nope.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.575
-Lucky her.
-Sorry this isn't up to your standards...

01:53.746 --> 01:57.341
-...I'm a little short on cash right now.
-So why did you leave NewMatch?

01:57.517 --> 02:00.714
Because Kirsten and I are better friends
than business partners, okay?

02:00.887 --> 02:02.445
Can we leave it at that?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.281
Excuse me.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.756
Five people in this house
and I eat dinner by myself.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.557
Hi.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.292
So we're still on for Friday, right?

02:17.337 --> 02:19.362
Well, I don't like sneaking around either...

02:19.539 --> 02:22.303
...but we don't have much of a choice,
do we?

02:22.809 --> 02:26.142
I know, I miss you too. What?

02:26.312 --> 02:31.045
That's just Summer's weird friend Che.
Hold on, I'll go outside, okay?

02:53.006 --> 02:55.406
-Che, what are you doing?
-The I Ching was devised...

02:55.575 --> 02:58.339
...by ancient Chinese mystics
as a way to interpret...

02:58.511 --> 03:00.809
...the invisible current of the universe.

03:01.714 --> 03:05.150
-What are you trying to figure out?
-I had a dream, Summer...

03:05.919 --> 03:09.377
...in which my soul mate
was revealed to me.

03:10.723 --> 03:14.659
-That's great.
-It's great, but it's complicated.

03:14.827 --> 03:19.025
I must be certain.
Dragon on a mountain top?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.258
That's interesting.

03:24.237 --> 03:27.229
Che, nothing against Chinese mystics...

03:27.407 --> 03:30.205
...but if you want to find out
if someone's your soul mate...

03:30.376 --> 03:32.037
...try spending time with them.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.147
-You think that's what I should do?
-Yeah, why not?

03:35.315 --> 03:38.682
-See if you have anything in common.
-Because the day after tomorrow is--

03:38.851 --> 03:41.581
There's Groundhog Day...

03:41.754 --> 03:45.190
...and I'm planning a little black ops mission
to free Newport Chuck.

03:45.358 --> 03:48.122
-The groundhog?
-Yeah. You've heard of this travesty?

03:48.294 --> 03:49.659
I've heard about the festival.

03:49.829 --> 03:52.764
They put him onstage with the mayor
and if he sees his shadow...

03:52.932 --> 03:56.698
...it means, six more weeks of winter,
which is crazy. We don't even have winters.

03:56.869 --> 03:59.360
-They treat him okay.
-No. Three hundred sixty-four days a year...

03:59.539 --> 04:02.736
...the duder is stuck in a cage
and now he's circus freak for a day?

04:02.909 --> 04:06.072
-No, that's absolutely criminal.
-Okay. Just don't involve me.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.908
That's how I got kicked out of Brown.
Coming to dinner?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.379
Go without me. Summer?

04:10.750 --> 04:13.150
Besides getting you kicked out
of college...

04:13.319 --> 04:15.787
...you know I'd never do
anything to hurt you.

04:17.322 --> 04:18.483
Of course.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.487
I'll see you in a little bit.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.732
Tomorrow, brother.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.472
Tomorrow we'll get this whole thing
figured out.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.601
That right there is grasshopper at night.

04:39.779 --> 04:43.806
-Are you sure you don't want to come?
-A movie about a guy eating an octopus?

04:43.983 --> 04:45.211
I think I'll pass.

04:45.385 --> 04:48.513
It's got one of the greatest fight sequences
in the last five years.

04:48.688 --> 04:51.521
-That'll convince her.
-What better way to see out your 30s...

04:51.691 --> 04:54.922
-...than a little South Korean shock cinema?
-So tempting.

04:55.094 --> 04:57.494
You're gonna be late, you better go.

05:07.940 --> 05:11.808
Oh, hi, it's Kirsten Cohen. I was wondering
if Dr. Harris could see me, it's urgent.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.412
You sure it's all right to leave?
She seems down.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.912
She's turning 40.
As beautiful as your mother is...

05:17.083 --> 05:18.710
...that's not easy.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.319
-Maybe we should stay.
-No. Trust me.

05:21.688 --> 05:24.282
All she wants is time alone
to process everything.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.448
You don't think she knows
about the party?

05:26.626 --> 05:29.891
No. Are you kidding me? Nobody plans
a surprise party like Sandy Cohen.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.758
I could have been with the ClA.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.762
I hear they are known for their
birthday parties.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.019
Morning, brother.

06:33.426 --> 06:36.657
Che, what are you--? This is real, right?
This isn't a dream?

06:36.829 --> 06:40.822
Unless this whole life is a dream.
But, no, for our purposes, you are awake.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.068
Seth, how do you feel about
subjugation of animals?

06:47.940 --> 06:49.202
I hate it?

06:49.375 --> 06:52.401
When a fellow mammal is being exploited
for cheap entertainment...

06:52.578 --> 06:55.172
...instead of being allowed to burrow
in the soft soil...

06:55.348 --> 06:57.543
...does it make you want to
tear your hair out?

06:57.717 --> 07:01.380
Then rise and shine, for the call of justice
has rung across the land.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.655
-I'm glad I don't sleep naked.
-Yeah, me too.

07:09.829 --> 07:12.059
I didn't think about that.

07:12.231 --> 07:13.721
You could have had--

07:13.900 --> 07:15.492
Tell him you want to feel his butt.

07:15.701 --> 07:18.670
Say how you can't wait to get
two big handfuls of butt.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.671
Okay, you guys, that's gross.
I'm supposed to be my mom, okay?

07:21.841 --> 07:23.365
Exactly.

07:23.543 --> 07:26.410
Look, you want this guy to think
your mom loves him, right?

07:26.946 --> 07:28.709
This is how adults talk to each other.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.577
I've been e-mailing Bullit as my mom
for a month now.

07:31.751 --> 07:34.811
You don't think it'd be weird
if I asked him about his butt?

07:34.987 --> 07:37.217
No. It just shows that she cares for him.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.590
-And his butt.
-Yeah.

07:39.759 --> 07:42.250
Don't you realize how much
you talk about guys' butts?

07:42.428 --> 07:44.521
Do you want your mom
to close the deal or not?

07:46.799 --> 07:51.099
"l miss your butt. Love, Julie."

07:51.270 --> 07:52.498
-Awesome.
-Awesome.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.774
-Hey, you busy?
-No.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.937
I'm just going to pick up
Kirsten's present.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.616
Thought you might want to come along.
Grab some lunch.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.308
Yeah, sure.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.449
-ls everything okay?
-Fine.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.955
How are you doing
with what's going on with Taylor?

08:13.125 --> 08:14.524
Okay.

08:14.894 --> 08:18.762
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. She needs time, I get it.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.491
I got plenty of other things
to keep me busy.

08:22.101 --> 08:25.832
Sandy, I'm fine. I'm not sitting around
missing her if that's what you're asking.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.935
-All right. Good.
-Yeah.

08:29.108 --> 08:30.268
-Half an hour?
-Yeah.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.240
All right.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.051
I need help, doctor.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.627
Taylor, admitting that is the first step
in recovery.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.730
But tell me, how did you hear about me?

08:52.899 --> 08:55.129
I read your article
about emotional addictions...

08:55.301 --> 08:57.166
...in the Journal of Abstract Thought...

08:57.336 --> 08:59.804
...and I saw you teach at UCl
and it seemed like fate.

08:59.972 --> 09:02.497
You think you're suffering
from an emotional addiction?

09:03.009 --> 09:04.772
Yeah, pretty much all my life.

09:04.944 --> 09:07.640
Because I never really knew my dad
and my mom is...

09:07.813 --> 09:09.872
...kind of like ldi Amin with fake boobs.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.847
Big on torturing and tyranny,
not so big on the nurturing.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.180
-I see.
-From there I turned into this person...

09:15.354 --> 09:19.814
...who whenever anybody held the prospect
of emotional support, I just seized on that.

09:19.992 --> 09:23.428
I married a man who I knew for two weeks
because he told me he loved me.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.188
How has that manifest itself now?

09:25.698 --> 09:27.461
Well, I'm dating this guy, Ryan...

09:27.633 --> 09:31.194
...and he's just really wonderful and...

09:31.370 --> 09:35.830
...I really care about him but I told him
that I needed some space because--

09:36.342 --> 09:39.675
Because you know that you're not ready
for a mature relationship.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.676
-You don't want to ruin it.
-Exactly.

09:41.847 --> 09:44.008
How has that been, this time apart?

09:45.217 --> 09:48.277
Well, that's kind of the other problem.

09:48.888 --> 09:55.384
Sometimes when I like someone,
I sometimes kind of stalk them.

09:57.697 --> 10:01.030
Not in like a scary Star 80 way.
Like I follow them around...

10:01.200 --> 10:03.100
...take pictures
and log their activities.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.535
Then compile it all in a factually accurate,
yet aesthetically pleasing scrapbook.

10:07.707 --> 10:09.766
It's all very-- Oh, my God, I'm a lunatic.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.069
Taylor, you are not a lunatic.

10:12.244 --> 10:14.371
You recognize
this behavior is not healthy...

10:14.547 --> 10:17.277
-...and you want to correct it.
-I do, I really, really do.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.747
All right, well--

10:18.918 --> 10:21.978
As you know from my article,
my methods are very aggressive.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.552
Okay.

10:25.725 --> 10:28.091
I'm in your hands, doctor.

10:36.035 --> 10:38.697
-What are you doing?
-Neil and I bought these in Cabo.

10:38.871 --> 10:41.066
-I'm selling them.
-Why?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.731
Because times are tough, Kaitlin.

10:43.909 --> 10:46.673
Do I need to remind you
that your boyfriend's a billionaire?

10:46.846 --> 10:48.245
No, he's not. I mean--

10:48.981 --> 10:52.348
-Are you cheating on Bullit?
-No, I'm not even dating him.

10:52.518 --> 10:55.248
That fizzled when he went to Dubai.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.753
Well, he thinks you guys are still dating.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.651
-Have you been talking to him?
-No. Just a couple e-mails.

11:02.428 --> 11:06.592
-And what have you told him?
-Nothing. Just-- I know he really likes you...

11:06.766 --> 11:09.234
...and he thinks you guys are still
a couple.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.427
But, wait. Are you seeing anyone else?

11:12.471 --> 11:14.735
That's none of your business.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.567
Fine. Okay, well--
What are you gonna tell the Bullit?

11:17.743 --> 11:19.472
Because he comes back today.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.305
Will you please answer that?

11:31.057 --> 11:32.786
Julie Cooper?

11:33.959 --> 11:35.950
Yeah, thank you.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.897
"Can't wait until tomorrow night.
Miss you already."

11:55.181 --> 11:58.275
Mrs. Cohen, thanks for waiting.

11:58.984 --> 12:01.817
So tell me what's going on.

12:01.987 --> 12:03.079
Well...

12:03.255 --> 12:05.519
...the last few weeks
I've been feeling weak.

12:05.691 --> 12:07.158
Just drained of energy.

12:07.359 --> 12:10.328
There's been some nausea,
light-headedness.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.363
-I have to ask, have you been drinking?
-Not a drop.

12:13.532 --> 12:16.023
-Has there been any undue stress?
-No.

12:16.202 --> 12:17.829
Well, I mean, not more than usual.

12:18.003 --> 12:20.028
Well, let's take some blood.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.231
Then we'll be able to tell you something.

12:23.943 --> 12:25.274
Oh, you turn 40 tomorrow.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.112
Happy birthday.

12:28.714 --> 12:29.840
Thanks.

12:42.561 --> 12:44.392
-You're crazy.
-Seth.

12:44.563 --> 12:47.464
I thought you wanted
to release turtles into the ocean.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.760
-I'm not helping you steal Newport Chuck.
-Why?

12:49.935 --> 12:51.869
Because he looks so happy down there?

12:52.037 --> 12:54.164
He seems all right
with the free carrot deal.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.675
I see this was a mistake.

13:00.846 --> 13:03.246
I guess we don't have much
in common after all.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.115
Oh, well.

13:06.886 --> 13:09.150
Who knows what might have been.

13:09.321 --> 13:11.050
Oh, God, fine. Okay.

13:12.525 --> 13:16.120
-What?
-You helped me heal my inner otter.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.785
I owe you.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.760
You mean, you want to help?

13:20.266 --> 13:23.724
Yeah, that's it. I feel like we have a bond.
So, what's the plan?

13:25.671 --> 13:27.639
Hey, peanut. Just left the airport.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.903
-We need to talk.
-Not if it's about the duty-free booze...

13:31.076 --> 13:35.911
-...you asked me to buy.
-No, it's definitely not about that.

13:36.515 --> 13:39.313
It's kind of about my mom.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.680
Something that I should talk
to you about.

13:41.854 --> 13:44.516
Okay, then, why don't you meet me
at the jewelry store?

13:45.124 --> 13:48.787
-What are you talking about?
-Squirt, I liked your mother before I left...

13:48.961 --> 13:50.792
...but the e-mails I've been getting...

13:50.963 --> 13:53.796
...especially the last one-- Let's just say...

13:53.999 --> 13:57.696
...I like the way her mind works.
Yes, she is the girl for me.

13:59.205 --> 14:02.868
-You're gonna ask her to marry you?
-Oh, damn. Why?

14:03.042 --> 14:05.203
-What were you gonna tell me?
-Nothing.

14:05.377 --> 14:07.504
She loves anything that's an emerald cut.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.140
So you're saying I should ask her.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.451
Yeah. Absolutely.
You should totally ask her.

14:15.554 --> 14:18.523
"Totally." That's great.

14:24.897 --> 14:26.330
You saved a valet ticket?

14:26.498 --> 14:28.227
Oh, yeah, that's from our third date.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.631
He's a very generous tipper.
You wouldn't know it to look at him.

14:32.938 --> 14:34.872
-What's this?
-Toothpick.

14:35.774 --> 14:39.210
-Gross.
-Well, he didn't use it. Much.

14:40.346 --> 14:41.677
Okay, Taylor...

14:41.847 --> 14:45.578
...although I wholeheartedly support
you getting rid of everything in this box...

14:45.751 --> 14:49.278
...for purely sanitary reasons,
if you like Ryan and he likes you...

14:49.588 --> 14:51.954
...forget the therapist
and figure it out together.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.716
All of this seems a little insane.

14:54.593 --> 14:57.858
Summer, my whole life I've been
completely powerless before people...

14:58.030 --> 14:59.793
...who say they have feelings for me.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.991
I feel I need to do this for myself
as much as for me and Ryan.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.670
Even if you lose him?

15:06.839 --> 15:09.603
If I don't do this,
I'm gonna lose him anyway.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.145
I don't have a choice.

15:14.313 --> 15:17.441
Okay, well, I hope you know
what you are doing.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.289
Yeah.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.655
Me too.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.506
-Kaitlin.
-Ryan.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.201
-Hi.
-Hey. You buying some jewelry?

15:46.378 --> 15:49.040
Oh, yeah, I'm just buying some class rings.

15:49.214 --> 15:51.512
-You here with someone?
-No. Are you?

15:51.684 --> 15:54.517
Yeah, Sandy's buying a part
of Kirsten's birthday present.

15:55.120 --> 15:59.318
-Hey, how's Taylor been?
-Well, weird.

15:59.491 --> 16:01.516
-Weird like?
-Weirder than normal.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.223
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:03.395 --> 16:06.694
-A little bit. Hi, Mr. Cohen.
-You coming to the party tomorrow?

16:06.865 --> 16:11.564
Yeah. Totally. Listen, I got to go,
but I'll see you guys.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.832
-ls everything okay?
-No.

16:14.006 --> 16:17.942
The guy in Carson-- I just got a message,
he lost it.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.600
-He lost it?
-Yeah.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.236
I don't know how you do this.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.181
The hell you hiding from?

16:27.519 --> 16:28.747
Just scared me.

16:28.921 --> 16:31.515
Quit hiding out in the shadows
like some Al Qaeda wacko.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.615
I just thought I saw my mom.
So, what did you end up getting?

16:37.563 --> 16:40.589
-How do you like that?
-Wow. Is it the most expensive one?

16:40.766 --> 16:44.065
Well, Bullit bought it, of course it is.
And your mama deserves it.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.204
Good. All right.
About that proposal--

16:46.372 --> 16:49.205
No, I got it worked out.
This lranian fellow on my flight...

16:49.375 --> 16:51.502
...played this Persian love song on his cell.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.612
So I downloaded it. Check it out.

16:58.751 --> 17:02.778
-Let's definitely talk about that proposal.
-Let's go to work.

17:14.299 --> 17:17.632
Once Chuck is outside for the ceremony,
there's gonna be too many eyes.

17:17.803 --> 17:21.534
The best bet is to break into the lobby
and take him from the city hall.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.698
-The door's locked.
-The main door's locked.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.707
Yesterday I took a tour
of city hall.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.108
I taped the lock on the fire door
on the roof.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.077
How is that tour? I've always wondered.

17:30.249 --> 17:33.741
It's surprisingly good. Good local history,
doesn't get too anecdotal.

17:33.919 --> 17:36.217
All right.
How do we get on the roof?

17:38.490 --> 17:41.323
You know what this is? A grappling hook.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.256
I climbed Denali last year.
It was an outward bound course.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.955
-This is gonna be a piece of cake.
-I've never climbed.

17:47.132 --> 17:50.499
-I brought a papoose for you.
-Oh, great, okay so we climb on the roof...

17:50.669 --> 17:53.934
...break in, break Chuck out,
climb down the roof.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.267
Return him to the savannas
of his childhood.

17:56.442 --> 17:57.636
He was captured in lrvine.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.505
-But just one thing.
-Yeah.

17:59.678 --> 18:02.511
You know this plan is insane, right?
It will never work.

18:03.515 --> 18:08.009
Seth, when the universe intends
for something to happen, it will happen.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.411
How about a pre-ops snow cone?

18:10.589 --> 18:12.147
-Okay.
-I'm talking your language?

18:12.324 --> 18:14.792
-You like snow cones?
-My favorite flavor is cherry...

18:14.960 --> 18:16.894
...but my dad's is blueberry.

18:18.230 --> 18:20.095
-Hi.
-Are you Ryan Atwood?

18:20.265 --> 18:22.324
-Yeah, can I help you?
-This is from Taylor.

18:22.501 --> 18:24.128
Okay--

18:24.303 --> 18:28.535
-Excuse me. Wait. Who are you?
-Dr. James.

18:29.641 --> 18:32.667
-I'm helping Taylor through some issues.
-So you're her therapist?

18:32.845 --> 18:38.044
-More of an emotional crisis manager.
-And she gave you-- Is she in your car?

18:40.152 --> 18:43.053
-Mr. Atwood.
-Taylor, what is this? What's going on?

18:43.222 --> 18:46.453
I have instructed her that she have
no contact with you for a week.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.150
Okay, but she's right here. Taylor.

18:49.328 --> 18:53.662
Can you just please tell him that I'm sorry
but I think this is best for me and us?

18:53.832 --> 18:56.357
-Ryan, she's sorry, but she feels--
-I heard that.

18:56.535 --> 18:59.163
Taylor, would you talk to me, please?
This is crazy.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.365
Would you at least tell me
what this is about?

19:02.541 --> 19:03.940
Are you breaking up with me?

19:07.513 --> 19:09.708
She asks that you trust her
for a while longer.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.842
Taylor, look, whatever the reason
you're doing all this you don't have to.

19:14.019 --> 19:15.919
We can work on it together. Please?

19:18.423 --> 19:19.788
Please.

19:24.229 --> 19:27.721
-Goodbye, Ryan.
-Does that mean--? Okay, you're gonna--

19:49.888 --> 19:52.516
Hey, little buddy.
Che.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.352
Che.

20:00.365 --> 20:04.631
-What was wrong with the elevator?
-Nothing. I just really love doing that.

20:05.003 --> 20:07.597
-Hey, little duder.
-What was that?

20:09.274 --> 20:11.174
Let's get-- Let's get out.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.809
Go. Go. Go.

20:19.718 --> 20:23.085
-Okay, where are the ropes?
-I left them inside.

20:23.922 --> 20:27.221
-Dude.
-It's all right. Relax, I'll go get them.

20:27.826 --> 20:29.384
-Here.
-Fine.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.431
Hey. There some sort of problem?

20:40.472 --> 20:44.431
It is possible that the piece of tape
I put over the lock got torn through.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.740
-So are you saying we're stuck up here?
-No.

20:48.947 --> 20:51.848
As long as I can--

20:52.451 --> 20:53.918
Yeah.

21:12.971 --> 21:14.529
Get out.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.633
Che, what are you doing?

21:18.810 --> 21:22.268
I didn't mean to wake you up.
I've been meditating over a dream.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.939
You realize this is the second time
you and I have spent the night together?

21:26.118 --> 21:29.087
-So?
-So....

21:29.421 --> 21:31.514
Does that mean anything to you?

21:32.557 --> 21:35.924
You'll be going on your little adventures
by yourself from now on?

21:38.497 --> 21:40.362
Seth.

21:41.266 --> 21:45.066
When the universe intends
for something to happen...

21:46.972 --> 21:49.964
...it will happen.
And our personal desires...

21:50.142 --> 21:53.168
...or natural predilections,
they just don't figure in.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.210
In fact....

21:57.749 --> 22:00.343
There's something
that I've been meaning to tell you.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.454
This belong to you two?

22:05.023 --> 22:06.115
Crouch behind me.

22:06.658 --> 22:09.456
Oh, happy birthday, sweetheart.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.889
-Thanks.
-Hey, come on, sit down.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.829
I am making you a birthday breakfast
you won't believe.

22:16.234 --> 22:19.431
That's sweet, but I don't think
I'm in the mood for a big breakfast.

22:19.604 --> 22:23.131
You take this turning 40 thing
a little hard. It's not the end of the world.

22:23.308 --> 22:27.506
You're more beautiful now than the day
we met. Soon Seth and Ryan will be gone.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.704
We'll do what we want,
be like kids again.

22:29.881 --> 22:32.349
-And live in the back of a mail truck?
-Why not?

22:33.552 --> 22:38.114
Maybe we'll throw in a pillow-top mattress.
My back's not what it used to be.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.121
Sandy....

22:41.293 --> 22:45.855
-Hey, happy birthday.
-Oh, hey, thanks.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.495
Did I interrupt something?

22:49.668 --> 22:51.431
-No.
-No.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.237
Okay.

22:55.974 --> 22:57.965
Excuse me.

22:58.143 --> 23:01.544
Hey, dinner reservations, 8:00.
Don't make any plans.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.309
-Any luck yet?
-Nothing.

23:03.482 --> 23:05.211
I must have made 30 calls yesterday.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.942
All right, anything you need me to do,
I'm all yours.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.620
Thanks.

23:10.088 --> 23:12.579
I feel she really needs this.

23:12.758 --> 23:16.524
Of course I can see the doctor today,
but can't she just tell me?

23:18.730 --> 23:21.460
I understand, she wants
to tell me in person.

23:24.836 --> 23:26.531
-Hi, babe.
-Mom, where are you?

23:26.705 --> 23:28.866
At the spa getting shined and buffed.
What's up?

23:29.040 --> 23:32.237
What does it feel like
when your appendix bursts?

23:33.812 --> 23:35.245
I don't feel proud.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.440
Well, you should be.
What you did yesterday was very difficult.

23:38.617 --> 23:41.381
Yeah, but the look on his face,
I just wanted to hold him.

23:41.553 --> 23:44.750
And you will. But first you have
to take care of yourself.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.254
Excuse me.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.585
Hello?

23:47.759 --> 23:49.249
Yes.

23:50.462 --> 23:51.486
All right.

23:51.663 --> 23:53.858
Listen, I've got to go. Another crisis.

23:54.032 --> 23:55.329
-But we'll talk later.
-Okay.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.899
All right.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.633
Oh. Sorry. Sorry about that.

24:05.811 --> 24:07.403
Good luck at the festival.

24:07.612 --> 24:11.571
Yeah, thanks. Come on, guys, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

24:17.889 --> 24:19.789
-Kaitlin?
-Mom, I'm fine.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.516
What?

24:24.529 --> 24:26.497
What are all these flowers doing here?

24:26.665 --> 24:30.431
-Someone wants to ask you something.
-What are you talking about?

24:30.602 --> 24:32.570
-There you are.
-Gordon.

24:32.737 --> 24:35.399
You are a sight for sore eyes.
Come to big daddy.

24:35.574 --> 24:36.598
Okay, everybody stop.

24:37.175 --> 24:41.009
What is going on? You're not dying.
And Gordon, what are you doing here?

24:41.179 --> 24:43.340
It's time, squirt. Hit it.

24:43.515 --> 24:47.007
-I really don't think that it's such a--
-Trust me. Hit it.

24:50.922 --> 24:52.321
Oh, my God.

24:52.491 --> 24:56.723
Julie Cooper, I've traveled the world over,
had everything money can buy...

24:56.895 --> 25:01.093
...but it comes a time in a billionaire's life
that his money ain't worth a dime...

25:01.266 --> 25:04.394
...unless he has someone
to share it with.

25:05.737 --> 25:07.728
Will you marry me?

25:13.512 --> 25:16.879
-I don't know what to say.
-Oh, well, "yes," works for me.

25:17.048 --> 25:20.643
-Mom, isn't this great?
-It's very, very nice.

25:20.819 --> 25:23.014
But please, stand up.

25:23.655 --> 25:26.317
I'm flattered, but--
Will you turn that off? Please.

25:26.491 --> 25:27.958
Okay.

25:28.126 --> 25:30.287
-I'm going.
-Thank you.

25:31.096 --> 25:34.725
-I guess I'm just surprised.
-Well, when I see something I want...

25:34.900 --> 25:38.734
...I go for it, like a bullet.

25:39.104 --> 25:42.369
But, Gordon, we haven't spoken
since you went to Dubai.

25:42.541 --> 25:46.136
Mom, he just asked you to marry him.
I mean, look at the ring.

25:46.311 --> 25:49.007
-It's ridonkulous.
-And what about all those e-mails.

25:49.180 --> 25:52.206
I've never seen so many X's and O's.
And that would be...

25:52.384 --> 25:55.319
-...hugs and kisses, right?
-What e-mails?

25:55.487 --> 25:57.921
You know, the music was actually
really awesome.

25:58.089 --> 26:02.185
And especially that last one.
You know, the one where you said:

26:09.467 --> 26:10.695
Oh, crap.

26:21.012 --> 26:22.240
-Hello?
-Caterpillar?

26:22.414 --> 26:24.882
Che, oh, my God, he looks so sad.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.278
-Who?
-Newport Chuck.

26:26.451 --> 26:29.011
I'm looking at him.
I thought you were gonna rescue him.

26:29.187 --> 26:31.212
Well, things didn't go exactly as planned.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.890
Are you at the fair right now?

26:33.058 --> 26:35.891
Yeah. They are setting up
for the ceremony. Where are you?

26:36.061 --> 26:38.791
-The Man caught me.
-What? You're in jail, Che?

26:38.964 --> 26:42.593
No, don't worry about me.
Focus on Chuck. He needs you right now.

26:42.801 --> 26:45.065
Caterpillar, you have to rescue him.

26:45.236 --> 26:46.965
No, Che, I told you
not to involve me.

26:47.639 --> 26:50.233
Sometimes, Summer...

26:51.509 --> 26:53.238
...our destiny is chosen for us.

26:55.246 --> 26:56.679
Fine, I'll see what I can do.

26:56.881 --> 26:58.109
Okay.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.384
It's all you.

27:04.155 --> 27:06.282
I was next.

27:07.492 --> 27:08.754
Who should I call?

27:09.427 --> 27:12.863
I see. So who else is onstage
other than the mayor...

27:13.031 --> 27:15.693
-...and Newport Chuck?
-A couple of the mayor's men...

27:15.867 --> 27:18.802
...some city council members,
few police officers.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.597
And so that's it?

27:20.772 --> 27:24.208
Wait, no, there's also a few people
dressed as groundhogs.

27:25.644 --> 27:29.842
-What paper did you say you're with?
-Groundhog's Day Weekly...

27:30.015 --> 27:32.279
...which comes out once a year,
usually around--

27:32.484 --> 27:36.011
- "Groundhog Day"?
-Yes. Thank you so much.

27:46.197 --> 27:48.165
You were e-mailing him pretending
to be me?

27:48.333 --> 27:51.325
I just know you don't deal well
with long distance relationships.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.835
-I thought you might regret it.
-Really? That's it?

27:54.005 --> 27:56.269
Nothing to do with being sick
of frozen dinners?

27:56.441 --> 28:00.434
What? Your saying no has nothing to do
with the fact you're seeing a mystery man?

28:00.612 --> 28:04.514
A, I never said, no.
B, that is my private life.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.447
Kaitlin, there is more to relationships
than just money.

28:07.652 --> 28:10.746
I don't care for the Bullit
just because he's a billionaire.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.618
Maybe I care a bit.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.055
But the reason
why I told him to marry you is...

28:15.226 --> 28:16.693
...because I know he loves you.

28:16.928 --> 28:20.830
And he's a really nice guy
and he's really funny.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.864
And he'd make an amazing stepdad.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.545
You have to tell him the truth.

28:41.986 --> 28:43.783
What are you gonna tell him?

28:44.889 --> 28:46.322
I don't know.

28:49.961 --> 28:52.327
You better make up your mind quick...

28:53.264 --> 28:55.824
...because I'm taking him with me
to Kirsten's party.

29:12.517 --> 29:14.849
-Hello.
-Kirsten, I need your help.

29:15.653 --> 29:18.053
-Oh, happy birthday.
-Thanks.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.914
-Bullit just proposed to me.
-That's nice.

29:21.092 --> 29:24.755
I told him I'd give him an answer
by tonight, but the truth is...

29:25.730 --> 29:28.631
...I've been seeing someone else.
You'll never believe who.

29:28.800 --> 29:32.099
Julie, I'm gonna lie down.
Congratulations.

29:39.110 --> 29:42.238
That was the guy at the junk yard
in Chatsworth. He's got one.

29:42.413 --> 29:45.405
He says he can have it at the yacht club
in an hour.

29:45.583 --> 29:49.041
-Sounds like everything's gonna be okay.
-Yeah, let's hope.

29:52.190 --> 29:57.127
-So, what's going on with you and Taylor?
-Well, we were taking a bit of a break...

30:01.766 --> 30:05.862
Stupid tree. Where did you go?

30:06.070 --> 30:08.095
--she showed up last night with a box--

30:08.273 --> 30:10.741
-Taylor was right there, right?
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

30:10.909 --> 30:13.901
But she wasn't supposed to talk to me.
At least, not directly.

30:14.078 --> 30:17.707
So whenever I asked her a question
she'd whisper her answer to her therapist.

30:22.620 --> 30:25.418
-It's crazy, huh?
-Yeah. I mean, a little.

30:26.057 --> 30:27.820
I want her to do
what she needs to do.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.586
-Did you tell her that?
-Well, I tried....

30:30.762 --> 30:32.491
Excuse me.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.360
Yeah. Oh, Seth? Where are you?

30:43.107 --> 30:45.234
Oh, crap.

30:49.981 --> 30:51.539
Taylor?

30:52.250 --> 30:53.945
What are you doing?

30:54.118 --> 30:56.279
I was just....

30:56.487 --> 30:58.250
Taylor, are you okay?

30:58.423 --> 31:01.358
I'm sorry, just forget you ever knew me.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.256
What? Taylor. Taylor.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.495
KTML News, action update.

31:07.665 --> 31:10.225
Newport Plaza
turned into a crime scene today...

31:10.401 --> 31:12.801
...as a young woman
dressed up as a groundhog...

31:12.971 --> 31:15.166
...grabbed Newport Chuck
and made a dash for it.

31:15.373 --> 31:18.968
And while Newport's beloved groundhog
has yet to be recovered...

31:19.143 --> 31:22.579
...the Newport Police Department
has taken a woman into custody...

31:22.780 --> 31:24.941
... whom they believe
to be the kidnapper.

31:26.117 --> 31:28.677
-My dad said he'll be right over.
-What about me?

31:28.853 --> 31:31.219
Don ' t worry, Darryl,
he knows you're here too.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.619
But I don't want to leave.

31:35.593 --> 31:37.584
Seth, I haven't been honest with you.

31:40.665 --> 31:42.360
Remember in the sweat lodge...

31:42.533 --> 31:46.367
...when you discovered
that your animus was a sea otter?

31:47.872 --> 31:49.396
Well...

31:49.574 --> 31:52.805
...see, I had a dream that night too...

31:52.977 --> 31:56.674
...and I discovered that my animal-self
was a bullfrog.

31:57.015 --> 31:59.540
Oh, that's awesome. Frogs are cool.

31:59.717 --> 32:03.346
Yeah, but there's kind of more to it.

32:04.689 --> 32:10.423
See, I also discovered
that the animus of my soul mate....

32:12.463 --> 32:16.900
Well, see my-- In the dream,
my bullfrog...

32:17.068 --> 32:21.129
...was in love...

32:22.040 --> 32:23.701
...with....

32:46.397 --> 32:48.422
A groundhog.

32:53.004 --> 32:55.666
It wasn't an otter at all.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.273
What? What wasn't an otter?

32:59.410 --> 33:02.277
Never mind. No, nothing. What?

33:02.480 --> 33:04.311
-You were gonna say-- Che.
-Never mind.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.040
Che, what wasn't an otter?

33:30.375 --> 33:33.037
I ate a squirrel once.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.812
-That's great.
-Cohen. Cooke.

33:35.980 --> 33:37.538
Someone's posted bail for you.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.644
You coming?

33:43.821 --> 33:45.846
No, you go.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.118
-I'm not leaving until we're both free.
-Works for me.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.074
Sandy, where have you been?
I called you three times.

34:05.243 --> 34:06.801
Well, it's been a busy afternoon.

34:07.278 --> 34:09.768
Tell me that you haven't planned
anything big tonight.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.574
On your birthday, sorry,
but I plead the fifth.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.344
-Can we meet at the club?
-I thought we'd go together.

34:15.520 --> 34:19.149
-I had to make other arrangements.
-Sandy.

34:19.322 --> 34:22.292
I'll see you in a few minutes.

34:22.460 --> 34:26.054
Hi, Dad. I hope I'm not late
for Mom's party.

34:29.167 --> 34:30.565
-Kirsten Cohen?
-Yes.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.295
I'm here to take you to your husband.

34:37.341 --> 34:39.036
You tried to steal Newport Chuck?

34:41.079 --> 34:44.571
Sometimes the universe makes you
do things that you don't even understand.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.717
Sure. Sandy didn't seem
too upset about it.

34:46.918 --> 34:50.877
Are you kidding? He's waited 1 8 years
for me to be arrested for political activism.

34:51.054 --> 34:54.183
It's probably the proudest moment
of his entire life.

34:55.693 --> 34:57.285
It's your mom.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.799
-Good evening.
-Good evening. Thank you.

35:01.966 --> 35:03.490
-You're welcome.
-Happy birthday.

35:03.668 --> 35:04.999
Thank you.

35:05.169 --> 35:07.899
I hope your father didn't do anything
too extravagant.

35:08.072 --> 35:11.508
Might be a little late for that. Yeah.

35:18.015 --> 35:20.984
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, that was my first thought too.

35:26.891 --> 35:29.291
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

35:31.162 --> 35:33.596
-Sandy, it's--
-No, it's not the same mail truck...

35:33.764 --> 35:36.665
...we had in Berkeley,
but it is exactly the same model.

35:36.834 --> 35:38.495
It's amazing. Thank you.

35:38.669 --> 35:40.967
And here's your real present.

35:44.342 --> 35:45.866
Happy birthday.

35:46.043 --> 35:49.501
Around the world first class air tickets.
Just you and me.

35:51.616 --> 35:52.913
That's not bad, huh?

35:54.685 --> 35:57.279
I think I can top it.

35:58.689 --> 36:01.089
-Can I talk to you in private?
-Yeah.

36:01.259 --> 36:04.888
-You two stay here.
-Fellas, watch the truck.

36:05.062 --> 36:06.825
Okay.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.064
I want you seated for this.

36:12.236 --> 36:13.794
Is everything okay?

36:13.971 --> 36:16.132
I went to the doctor.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.541
Are you sick?

36:18.709 --> 36:22.110
Yes. But only in the mornings.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.013
What?

36:24.782 --> 36:26.647
I'm pregnant.

36:28.052 --> 36:29.417
Wait-- One more time.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.119
Sandy, we're having a baby.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.452
We're having a baby?

36:35.826 --> 36:38.727
-Everything's gonna change.
-You're not kidding.

36:43.568 --> 36:45.263
-I love you.
-Well, that's good...

36:45.436 --> 36:48.303
...because there's gonna be
a lot more of me to love.

36:53.678 --> 36:55.077
Oh, my gosh.

36:58.983 --> 37:02.919
And then Brad was like "Oh, no."
And I was like, "Oh, yeah."

37:03.988 --> 37:05.751
That Brad sounds like
a piece of work.

37:05.957 --> 37:09.859
And I still can't believe
you wrote me all those e-mails.

37:10.027 --> 37:11.494
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

37:11.696 --> 37:14.756
And that last one?
Little frisky. Little inappropriate.

37:15.499 --> 37:18.195
But what the hell. The offer still stands...

37:18.369 --> 37:21.861
...she's still the most exciting woman
I've ever met.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.971
-Kaitlin. Gordon.
-Mom, did you hear that?

37:26.143 --> 37:27.974
Bullit still wants to marry you.

37:28.846 --> 37:32.179
Yes, well, Gordon, that's very generous.

37:34.485 --> 37:36.453
But I'm afraid my answer has to be no.

37:39.523 --> 37:41.286
Sit down, I'm not finished.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.989
As I was saying, no...

37:47.164 --> 37:49.792
...because we don't know each other
well enough...

37:49.967 --> 37:52.367
...but I'm willing to correct that.

37:52.570 --> 37:53.901
I like you, Gordon.

37:54.105 --> 37:57.939
And if, after spending time together,
I can grow to love you...

37:58.476 --> 38:00.967
...then, yes, I would be proud
to be your wife.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.810
Come here.

38:14.592 --> 38:19.029
-Can I get up now?
-Yes, of course, you can get up.

38:31.676 --> 38:33.075
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

38:33.277 --> 38:36.110
-That's what I said.
-I know this isn't what you expected.

38:36.280 --> 38:39.477
That's family. There's nothing
more important than that. I mean....

38:39.650 --> 38:41.311
I mean...

38:41.886 --> 38:43.217
...you're pregnant.

38:43.387 --> 38:46.117
-It's so weird.
-Yeah. Well, congratulations.

38:46.290 --> 38:48.690
-Yeah, it's great.
-Yeah.

38:48.859 --> 38:51.054
It makes me getting arrested
seem trivial now.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.287
-You got what?
-Thanks for prepping her, Dad.

38:53.464 --> 38:55.489
Oh, that. We'll deal with that later.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.362
Right now
we've got some guests inside.

38:58.569 --> 39:01.766
-I was gonna go pick up Summer.
-Could you give me a ride, I got to--

39:01.972 --> 39:04.406
Tell Taylor you love her,
you can't live without her.

39:04.575 --> 39:07.601
Something like that.
Hey, I'll see you guys in a few minutes.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.080
And suddenly we're alone again.

39:15.252 --> 39:17.152
Not for long.

39:37.475 --> 39:39.443
-Take care of him.
-Soon, he'll burrow...

39:39.610 --> 39:41.077
...with brothers and sisters.

39:41.245 --> 39:44.510
I'm sorry you got arrested.
I should have never asked for your costume.

39:44.682 --> 39:46.707
I didn't mean to get you into trouble.

39:46.884 --> 39:50.149
It's okay. Turns out the mayor is
a lover of our animal brethren.

39:50.654 --> 39:53.817
-He gave us both amnesty.
-Yeah and this way we got to meet.

39:54.592 --> 39:57.993
The universe works in mysterious ways.

39:58.162 --> 40:00.790
So your dream was right
all along, it's amazing.

40:00.965 --> 40:04.162
Hey. Wow. Crowded room.
You guys off?

40:04.368 --> 40:07.462
Yes, to where the winds
of liberty blow over the mountaintops.

40:07.671 --> 40:09.662
Like Chicago or something?

40:09.840 --> 40:11.467
Take care, you two.

40:11.675 --> 40:13.370
Okay.

40:13.544 --> 40:16.638
-ln another life, brother.
-Hey.

40:17.047 --> 40:18.537
Hey.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.617
Are we late
for your mom's party?

40:20.785 --> 40:23.151
Actually, I think it may be
more of a baby shower.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.218
But I'll explain in the car.

40:25.389 --> 40:27.380
Or maybe I won't. I think it's a secret.

40:27.558 --> 40:30.254
Listen, what did Che mean
when he said "in another life"?

40:30.428 --> 40:32.259
In another life, what?

40:41.772 --> 40:43.296
Hello.

40:44.241 --> 40:46.766
-Hello?
-Oh, yeah.

40:46.944 --> 40:50.072
-Who is this?
-What are you wearing?

40:50.247 --> 40:52.715
-Ryan?
-No.

40:53.684 --> 40:54.981
Hey.

40:55.753 --> 40:58.916
-Were you just trying to stalk me?
-I guess I need more practice.

40:59.089 --> 41:02.286
That is the most romantic thing
anyone has ever done for me.

41:04.728 --> 41:07.356
So does that mean
the whole space thing--?

41:07.531 --> 41:11.831
Yeah, terrible idea. But you don't mind
dating someone who's a total weirdo?

41:12.036 --> 41:14.971
No, no. In fact, I was thinking
we could work around it.

41:15.139 --> 41:19.701
Like, I have to go to Kirsten's party,
but if you wanted, you could follow me.

41:19.910 --> 41:23.038
Yes. And when we get there,
I could hide and just kind of watch you.

41:23.214 --> 41:26.672
Exactly. Exactly. And then
on the way home, I can stalk you.

41:26.851 --> 41:28.546
Yes. And then I'll stalk you.

42:06.790 --> 42:09.020
Hi, it's me.

42:10.294 --> 42:14.697
No, I won't be making it tonight.

42:14.865 --> 42:17.698
Listen...

42:17.868 --> 42:19.961
...I'm back with Bullit.

42:20.804 --> 42:23.739
I know. I know.

42:25.242 --> 42:28.211
But this is the best thing for my family.

42:29.747 --> 42:31.681
I'm sorry.

42:35.085 --> 42:38.521
-Me too.
-Goodbye, Frank.
