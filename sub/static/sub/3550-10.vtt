WEBVTT

00:00.731 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.175
ORSON'S BLACKMAILING ME
TO STAY WITH HIM.

00:04.175 --> 00:06.637
TO ESCAPE HER MARRIAGE...
 LAMAR BENJAMIN?

00:06.637 --> 00:09.510
YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND ORSON
FROM THE STATE PENITENTIARY.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.213
BREE ARRANGED
HER OWN BLACKMAIL...

00:12.213 --> 00:15.046
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT ANYMORE.
 WHILE A FRIENDSHIP...

00:15.046 --> 00:17.048
OH.
 HIT THE ROCKS.

00:17.048 --> 00:19.050
LYNETTE,
YOU WANTED TO SUE US!

00:19.050 --> 00:20.691
THAT PROVES THAT
YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND.
 OH, MY GOD!

00:20.691 --> 00:23.524
(Nick) ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN.
ALL RIGHT? I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.157
I USED A PREPAID, AND THERE'S NO
WAY THEY'RE EVER GONNA FIND US.
 (Angie) I KILLED A MAN.

00:26.157 --> 00:29.100
A DESPERATE ACT...
 DANNY? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

00:29.100 --> 00:31.332
LED TO A REVELATION.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.205
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME JUICE, DANNY?
 MY NAME'S TYLER.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.070
THE WHOLE TIME I WAS WITH YOU,
ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT WAS SUSAN.

00:39.070 --> 00:43.114
AND A REVELATION...
 IF YOU MEAN IT,
THEN PLEASE KILL ME.

00:43.114 --> 00:46.417
I DON'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT YOU
TO KILL YOU.

00:46.417 --> 00:49.120
LED TO A DESPERATE ACT.
 (shaky voice) I NEED
AN AMBULANCE RIGHT AWAY.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.822
I'M LOSING A LOT OF BLOOD.
(gasps)

00:51.822 --> 00:53.684
(clatters)

00:58.829 --> 01:02.193
(Mary Alice) DAPHNE BICKS
WAS AN UNHAPPY WOMAN.

01:02.193 --> 01:06.066
AND NO ONE KNEW THIS BETTER
THAN HER HUSBAND.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.340
THAT'S WHY HE HIRED HER
TO WORK WITH HIM.

01:09.340 --> 01:13.274
HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT
CHEER HER UP.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.276
BUT SADLY,

01:15.276 --> 01:17.278
JEFF BICKS SOON DISCOVERED

01:17.278 --> 01:19.680
THAT IT WOULD TAKE
A LOT MORE THAN A JOB...

01:19.680 --> 01:21.282
THIS COFFEE'S COLD.

01:21.282 --> 01:25.156
TO KEEP HIS WIFE
FROM COMPLAINING.

01:25.156 --> 01:26.817
(scoffs)

01:26.817 --> 01:29.660
SHE COMPLAINED FROM THE MOMENT
THEY GOT UP IN THE MORNING...

01:29.660 --> 01:31.792
WELL, ANOTHER SLEEPLESS NIGHT
THANKS TO YOUR SNORING.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.794
(horns honking)
 TILL THEY WERE
ON THEIR WAY HOME

01:33.794 --> 01:35.796
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

01:35.796 --> 01:39.570
YOU WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN
HIT ALL THE RED LIGHTS?

01:39.570 --> 01:41.572
THINGS HAD GOTTEN SO BAD,

01:41.572 --> 01:46.537
JEFF BICKS BEGAN TO WONDER WHEN
GOD WOULD END HIS SUFFERING.

01:46.537 --> 01:49.680
LUCKILY FOR JEFF,

01:49.680 --> 01:52.643
GOD HAD A PLAN.

01:52.643 --> 01:54.245
(engine whirring)

01:54.245 --> 01:56.247
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE!
YOU'RE SO CHEAP.

01:56.247 --> 01:58.249
IT'S FRIGGIN' CHRISTMAS,
FOR GOD SAKE.

01:58.249 --> 02:00.321
I'M NOT BUYING YOU
A NEW CAR.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.323
TRICIA REED'S HUSBAND
GOT HER A NEW CAR.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.826
IT ISN'T EVEN A HOLIDAY.
 HE BOUGHT IT FOR HER
BECAUSE SHE BEAT CANCER.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.798
YOU BEAT CANCER,
I'LL BUY YOU A CAR.

02:07.798 --> 02:10.161
DON'T BEAT IT,
I'LL BUY YOU TWO.

02:10.161 --> 02:13.464
WHY ARE WE EVEN TOGETHER?
 (flatly) THE HOT SEX.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.206
YOU'RE CHEAP, RUDE.

02:15.206 --> 02:16.867
YOU LACK AMBITION.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.869
I SHOULD JUST DUMP
YOUR SORRY ASS.

02:18.869 --> 02:20.871
YOU WANT A GIFT?
YOU WANT A GIFT?

02:20.871 --> 02:22.543
HOW ABOUT A DIVORCE?

02:22.543 --> 02:24.545
HA. DON'T TEMPT ME.
 I'M SERIOUS.

02:24.545 --> 02:27.448
I ALREADY GOT THE NAME
OF A DIVORCE ATTORNEY.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.920
(engine continues whirring)

02:29.920 --> 02:31.722
YOU WANT A DIVORCE?

02:31.722 --> 02:33.384
YOU GOT IT!

02:33.384 --> 02:35.386
YES, VIRGINIA,
THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS,

02:35.386 --> 02:37.758
AND HE'S GIVING ME
MY BALLS BACK!

02:37.758 --> 02:40.261
CORRECTION--ONE OF THEM.
I GET HALF OF EVERYTHING.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.264
BUT NOT THE BUSINESS.
I STARTED THAT.
 WITH MY FATHER'S MONEY.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.436
SO I GET HALF,
AND I'M SELLING IT.

02:45.436 --> 02:47.738
WAIT A MINUTE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

02:47.738 --> 02:49.570
OH-HO!
SO NOW YOU'RE SCARED?

02:49.570 --> 02:50.871
YOU'D BE THAT VINDICTIVE?

02:50.871 --> 02:53.804
DESTROY THE ONE THING I LOVE
OUT OF SPITE?

02:53.804 --> 02:56.377
HELLO?! HAVE WE MET?
OF COURSE I WOULD.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.379
AND I AM NOT STOPPING THERE.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.682
BANK ACCOUNTS, PENSION FUNDS--
OOH, I'M GONNA RUIN YOU.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.884
(gasps)
 OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

03:03.884 --> 03:05.756
(strained voice)
I CAN'T BREATHE.

03:05.756 --> 03:07.718
(scoffs)
NICE TRY, BIG FAKER.

03:07.718 --> 03:10.721
OH! MY CHEST HURTS LIKE HELL.
TAKE THE CONTROLS.

03:10.721 --> 03:11.892
WHAT?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.894
AH!
YOU GOTTA LAND THE PLANE.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.226
UHH!

03:15.226 --> 03:16.227
OH.

03:16.227 --> 03:18.899
WHAT?! NO!
YOU PIECE OF CRAP!

03:18.899 --> 03:21.602
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!

03:21.602 --> 03:23.274
AND THAT IS HOW

03:23.274 --> 03:26.907
THE UNHAPPY MARRIAGE OF
JEFF AND DAPHNE BICKS ENDED--

03:26.907 --> 03:28.739
IN A PLANE

03:28.739 --> 03:30.811
LOSING ALTITUDE

03:30.811 --> 03:33.744
RIGHT ABOVE A CUL-DE-SAC...

03:33.744 --> 03:35.746
HEY, IS IT JUST ME,

03:35.746 --> 03:38.449
OR IS THAT PLANE FLYING
 REALLY LOW?

03:38.449 --> 03:41.221
BY THE NAME OF WISTERIA LANE.

03:41.221 --> 03:59.370
DAD, I THINK
IT'S GONNA CRASH.

03:59.370 --> 04:02.773
THE BEST CHRISTMAS EVER--

04:02.773 --> 04:06.347
THAT'S WHAT THE RESIDENTS OF
WISTERIA LANE WERE DREAMING OF

04:06.347 --> 04:10.721
AS THEY PREPARED FOR
THEIR ANNUAL YULETIDE FESTIVAL.

04:10.721 --> 04:13.824
SO THEY HUNG UP A BANNER...

04:13.824 --> 04:17.827
(panting)
 BROUGHT OUT
THEIR CANDY CANES...

04:17.827 --> 04:20.991
AND PUT UP SANTA'S WORKSHOP,

04:20.991 --> 04:24.435
AS EAGER AS CHILDREN
FOR THE HOLIDAY TO BEGIN.

04:24.435 --> 04:26.497
OF COURSE,

04:26.497 --> 04:29.340
SOME WERE MORE CHILDISH
THAN OTHERS.

04:29.340 --> 04:32.343
LOOK AT THIS MESS.
IT'S LIKE SANTA'S COLON.

04:32.343 --> 04:33.804
(laughing)

04:33.804 --> 04:35.676
(laughs)

04:35.676 --> 04:37.748
THAT'S FUNNY.
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

04:37.748 --> 04:41.852
HILARIOUS. ALMOST AS FUNNY
AS WHEN ORSON SAID IT LAST YEAR.

04:44.355 --> 04:47.057
OKAY. HOW ABOUT
SOME CHRISTMAS MUSIC?

04:47.057 --> 04:49.660
PARKER, YOU GOT
THAT SOUND SYSTEM FIXED?

04:49.660 --> 04:50.691
(loud electrical pop)

04:50.691 --> 04:52.062
(chuckles) ALMOST.

04:52.062 --> 04:55.065
DO WE REALLY WANT THE KID
WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY?

04:55.065 --> 04:58.028
HE CAN'T EVEN GET
THE NEWSPAPER ON MY PORCH.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.004
YOU'RE CLUMPING.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.781
HEY, WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU TWO?
 I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT.

05:10.781 --> 05:12.913
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU NEED TO WORK IT OUT.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.915
WE ARE CAROLING AT THE FESTIVAL
ON SATURDAY,

05:14.915 --> 05:17.448
AND WE CAN'T HAVE TWO OF
OUR JINGLE BELLES FIGHTING.

05:17.448 --> 05:19.450
YOU KNOW, IF YOU NEED
A REPLACEMENT,

05:19.450 --> 05:21.922
I'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT I HAVE A DUSKY ALTO.
 (Karen) NO WAY!

05:21.922 --> 05:23.624
GIRLS ONLY.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.726
WE'RE THE JINGLE BELLES,
 NOT THE JINGLE BALLS.

05:25.726 --> 05:29.360
SHOULDN'T YOU BE OUT STEALING
THE LAST CAN OF WHO HASH?

05:29.360 --> 05:31.902
YOU WANT TO SEE ME
GO ALL GRINCH ON YOUR ASS?

05:33.864 --> 05:36.367
TO BE HONEST, BREE,
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE ABLE

05:36.367 --> 05:39.370
TO SING WITH LYNETTE
AFTER SHE WAS--
 AFTER SHE WHAT?
ARE YOU ABOUT TO TRASH ME?

05:39.370 --> 05:41.872
I HAVE WAY TOO MUCH CLASS
TO TRASH YOU,

05:41.872 --> 05:43.874
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU DESERVE IT.

05:43.874 --> 05:46.847
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME.
WHAT DID SHE DO?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.348
SHE'S SUING CARLOS.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.881
YOU'RE SUING HIM?
 BECAUSE HE FIRED ME.

05:50.881 --> 05:53.584
HE FIRED HER?
 BECAUSE SHE LIED
ABOUT BEING PREGNANT.

05:53.584 --> 05:55.686
YOU'RE PREGNANT?!
 WITH TWINS.

05:55.686 --> 05:58.028
YOU KNEW?
 I TOLD HER
TO KEEP IT QUIET.

05:58.028 --> 06:01.061
CONGRATULATIONS.
 SURE, TAKE HER SIDE.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.764
SHE'S NOT!
 STOP FIGHTING.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.467
I MEAN, WITH ALL WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH LATELY--

06:06.467 --> 06:08.939
JULIE BEING ATTACKED,
DANNY BOLEN'S OVERDOSE--

06:08.939 --> 06:11.872
WE REALLY NEED SOME
CHRISTMAS SPIRIT AROUND HERE.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.574
SUSAN'S RIGHT.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.677
THIS IS THE TIME
WE SHOULD COME TOGETHER

06:16.677 --> 06:18.679
AND CELEBRATE PEACE ON EARTH

06:18.679 --> 06:20.911
AND GOOD WILL
TOWARDS MEN AND...

06:20.911 --> 06:23.914
(sirens wailing,
dogs barking in distance)

06:26.417 --> 06:29.490
OH, CRAP. WHO'S DEAD NOW?

06:29.490 --> 06:31.992
(gurney rattling)

06:31.992 --> 06:33.694
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.626
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED
TO KATHERINE.

06:37.728 --> 06:40.030
OH, MY GOD. I WAS JUST THERE
FIVE MINUTES AGO.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.732
WAS SHE OKAY?

06:41.732 --> 06:43.734
WELL, SHE WAS REALLY UPSET.

06:43.734 --> 06:46.036
I HOPE SHE DIDN'T
DO SOMETHING TO HERSELF.

06:47.738 --> 06:49.740
HEY, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS,

06:49.740 --> 06:51.742
BUT I JUST HEARD THE COPS SAY

06:51.742 --> 06:54.785
THAT SOMEONE STABBED KATHERINE
RIGHT IN THE GUT.
 WHAT? WHO WOULD DO THAT?

06:58.919 --> 07:02.993
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.759
HEY THERE. HOW YOU FEELING?

07:08.759 --> 07:10.761
A LITTLE HUNGRY.

07:10.761 --> 07:14.705
THAT'S 'CAUSE
THEY PUMPED YOUR STOMACH.

07:14.705 --> 07:16.837
BUT IF YOU WANT, TYLER,

07:16.837 --> 07:18.869
I CAN HAVE THEM
BRING YOU SOME SOUP.

07:18.869 --> 07:21.141
WHY DID YOU JUST
CALL ME THAT?

07:21.141 --> 07:23.744
YOU TOLD ME TO, LAST NIGHT.
 NO, I DIDN'T.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.045
YES, YOU DID. TWICE.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.047
YOU WERE STILL
A LITTLE GROGGY,

07:27.047 --> 07:29.049
BUT YOU DEFINITELY SAID
YOUR NAME WAS TYLER.

07:29.049 --> 07:32.753
UM, MAYBE I WAS DREAMING.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.986
MY NAME'S DANNY.

07:35.986 --> 07:39.059
OKAY.

07:41.191 --> 07:44.495
UM, CAN I SEE MY MOM?

07:44.495 --> 07:45.666
PLEASE.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.868
I'M SORRY. NOT WHILE
YOU'RE UNDER OBSERVATION.

07:49.940 --> 07:53.744
I'LL HAVE SOMEONE
BRING YOU THAT SOUP... DANNY.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.779
I DON'T GET THIS.
WE GAVE YOU A CHECK

07:58.779 --> 08:01.081
TO COVER THE AMBULANCE
AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO FAR.
 I KNOW.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.814
BUT WE STILL NEED YOUR INSURANCE
INFORMATION, MR. BOLEN.

08:03.814 --> 08:06.787
IT'S HOSPITAL POLICY.
 LIKE US NOT BEING ABLE
TO SEE OUR KID?

08:06.787 --> 08:08.789
SO YOU HAVE
TWO STUPID POLICIES.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.891
THERE COULD BE
SOME UNFORESEEN EXPENSES,

08:10.891 --> 08:13.864
TESTS WE MAY HAVE TO RUN.

08:13.864 --> 08:16.166
IF YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE,
THERE ARE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS.
 (sighs)

08:16.166 --> 08:18.869
MM.
 IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME
YOUR INFORMATION--

08:18.869 --> 08:20.871
NO! WE DON'T NEED
A HANDOUT.

08:20.871 --> 08:23.704
WE HAVE CASH.
THANK YOU, THOUGH.
 GAYLE.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.076
CAN I SPEAK WITH THE BOLENS?

08:28.208 --> 08:31.041
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

08:31.041 --> 08:34.645
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:34.645 --> 08:36.647
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP

08:36.647 --> 08:38.649
THE MOMENT
YOU MOVED ONTO THE LANE.

08:38.649 --> 08:40.951
I MEAN... YOU NEVER
TALK ABOUT YOUR PAST.

08:40.951 --> 08:43.854
WELL, WE'RE PRIVATE PEOPLE.
IS THERE A LAW AGAINST THAT?

08:43.854 --> 08:46.857
HAVING NO INSURANCE, WANTING TO
PAY CASH FOR EVERYTHING,

08:46.857 --> 08:50.661
HAVING A SON WHO CAN'T REMEMBER
IF HIS NAME IS DANNY OR TYLER...

08:51.962 --> 08:54.665
WHERE YOU GOING
WITH ALL THIS, MONA?

08:56.536 --> 08:59.610
YOU'RE IN THE WITNESS PROTECTION
PROGRAM, AREN'T YOU?

09:01.842 --> 09:03.574
HUH.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.578
YOU ARE ONE SHARP COOKIE.

09:07.578 --> 09:09.249
(laughs)

09:09.249 --> 09:11.882
HOW'D YOU FIGURE IT OUT?

09:11.882 --> 09:13.323
HONESTLY?

09:13.323 --> 09:17.327
ONCE I NOTICED YOU WERE ITALIAN,
I JUST KINDA WENT FROM THERE.

09:17.327 --> 09:18.829
NO OFFENSE.

09:18.829 --> 09:20.661
NONE TAKEN.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.663
(chuckles)
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M RIGHT.

09:22.663 --> 09:26.737
SO... WHAT WENT DOWN?
YOU WITNESS A HIT?

09:26.737 --> 09:28.969
DID YOU RAT ON
ONE OF THE FIVE FAMILIES?

09:28.969 --> 09:30.701
WE, UM...

09:30.701 --> 09:33.704
WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT, MONA.

09:33.704 --> 09:36.607
AND NEITHER CAN YOU,
TO ANYBODY.

09:36.607 --> 09:38.709
OF COURSE NOT.

09:38.709 --> 09:41.812
BECAUSE IF YOU DO
 SAY ANYTHING...

09:41.812 --> 09:44.685
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
HAVE YOU WHACKED.

09:48.719 --> 09:49.690
(laughs)

09:49.690 --> 09:51.221
(laughs)
 (laughs)

09:51.221 --> 09:55.095
(all laughing)

10:01.271 --> 10:03.674
MM.

10:03.674 --> 10:07.077
ANY MORE NEWS
ABOUT MIKE AND KATHERINE?

10:07.077 --> 10:10.110
NO. BUT I'M SURE
HE'LL BE EXONERATED.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.684
MIKE COULD NEVER
DO SOMETHING THAT AWFUL.

10:13.684 --> 10:16.917
THAT'S MY BREE--ALWAYS SEEING
THE GOOD IN PEOPLE.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.388
YES.

10:18.388 --> 10:22.092
WELL, UM...

10:22.092 --> 10:25.295
FORGIVE ME FOR STARTING YOUR DAY
ON A SOUR NOTE,

10:25.295 --> 10:27.297
BUT I FILED FOR DIVORCE.

10:27.297 --> 10:28.999
HERE ARE THE PAPERS.

10:28.999 --> 10:31.932
AND IF YOU TRY TO STOP ME,

10:31.932 --> 10:35.105
YOUR PAROLE OFFICER
WILL SEE THESE.

10:35.105 --> 10:38.669
CONSORTING WITH A KNOWN FELON
IS A PAROLE VIOLATION.

10:38.669 --> 10:41.772
IF YOU SEND ME TO JAIL
FOR FRAUD,

10:41.772 --> 10:43.073
YOU'RE GOING WITH ME.

10:43.073 --> 10:45.716
IT'S OVER, ORSON.

10:47.217 --> 10:51.421
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN
QUITE A PROJECT FOR YOU--

10:51.421 --> 10:54.785
FINDING LAMAR,
SETTING UP THE CAMERA.

10:54.785 --> 10:57.728
SORRY TO PUT YOU THROUGH
SO MUCH NEEDLESS TROUBLE.

10:57.728 --> 10:59.389
I WOULD HARDLY SAY
NEEDLESS.

10:59.389 --> 11:01.892
WITHOUT THESE, YOU'D STILL
HAVE A GUN TO MY HEAD.

11:01.892 --> 11:05.235
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULD SEND YOU TO JAIL?

11:05.235 --> 11:07.768
IT'S WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN THREATENING.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.741
I WAS BLUFFING, BREE,
RIGHT FROM THE START.

11:10.741 --> 11:15.045
I COULD NEVER HURT YOU
THAT BADLY, NO MATTER WHAT.

11:15.045 --> 11:17.778
Y-YOU DIDN'T NEED THESE.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.981
YOU COULD'VE CALLED MY BLUFF
AND WALKED AWAY ANYTIME.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.787
I SUPPOSE THE FACT
THAT YOU DID BELIEVE ME,

11:26.787 --> 11:29.790
THAT YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT I'D
DESTROY YOU JUST OUT OF SPITE,

11:29.790 --> 11:32.062
THAT ALONE SHOULD'VE TOLD ME
IT WAS OVER.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.928
I WILL PACK AFTER BREAKFAST.

11:40.971 --> 11:42.432
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

11:42.432 --> 11:45.405
I'M SORRY
IT HAD TO END THIS WAY.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.707
ME, TOO.

11:50.841 --> 11:54.414
THESE SCONES YOU MADE
ARE DELICIOUS.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.987
I'LL MISS THEM.

12:07.858 --> 12:10.100
HERE'S KATHERINE'S ROOM.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.462
NOW YOU MIGHT HEAR
SOME SCREAMS FOR HELP IN THERE.

12:12.462 --> 12:14.164
IGNORE THEM.

12:14.164 --> 12:16.166
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEANT BY,

12:16.166 --> 12:19.840
"I'LL BEHAVE CALMLY
AND RATIONALLY"?
 THAT WAS JUST TO GET YOU
TO UNLOCK THE CAR DOOR.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.842
SUSAN, YOU GOTTA GO IN THERE

12:21.842 --> 12:23.944
AND BE KATHERINE MAYFAIR'S
BEST FRIEND,

12:23.944 --> 12:28.748
BECAUSE SHE COULD PUT MIKE AWAY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
 I KNOW. I KNOW.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.750
MIGHT HELP
IF YOU GIVE HER THESE.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.052
GOOD IDEA.

12:32.052 --> 12:36.426
SHE PISSES ME OFF, I CAN
CRACK THE VASE OVER HER HEAD.

12:36.426 --> 12:37.828
(clatter)

12:42.863 --> 12:45.365
NO, DYLAN. THE POLICE HAVE
EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.938
THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU
TO FLY OUT HERE.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.873
UH, HONEY,
I-I'VE GOT A VISITOR.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.774
I GOTTA GO.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.376
OKAY, TALK TO YOU LATER.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.949
(hangs up receiver)

12:58.949 --> 13:02.983
SUSAN, COME IN.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.514
HI, KATHERINE.

13:04.514 --> 13:07.117
OH.

13:07.117 --> 13:08.889
OH...

13:08.889 --> 13:11.391
WHAT A SWEET GIFT.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.494
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
I'D SEE YOU HERE.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.930
WELL, I WAS... CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU, KATHERINE.

13:19.930 --> 13:22.472
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE.

13:22.472 --> 13:26.376
ACTUALLY, THE ONE THEY SHOULD
BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS YOU.

13:26.376 --> 13:28.338
WHY IS THAT?

13:28.338 --> 13:30.440
BECAUSE THE MAN
YOU JUST MARRIED

13:30.440 --> 13:33.013
TURNED OUT
TO BE A MANIAC.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.015
YEAH, UM...

13:35.015 --> 13:36.416
(chuckles)

13:36.416 --> 13:39.489
ABOUT THAT--UH...

13:41.521 --> 13:45.425
WE BOTH KNOW...

13:45.425 --> 13:49.329
THAT MIKE DIDN'T DO THIS.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.361
REALLY?

13:54.164 --> 13:56.166
I'VE GOT SEVEN STITCHES

13:56.166 --> 13:58.538
AND A KNIFE
WITH MIKE'S FINGERPRINTS

13:58.538 --> 14:01.141
THAT SAY OTHERWISE.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.479
IT DOESN'T MAKE...

14:09.479 --> 14:13.083
ANY SENSE.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.985
WHY WOULD MIKE

14:14.985 --> 14:17.627
WANT TO STAB YOU?

14:20.630 --> 14:22.933
WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW...

14:22.933 --> 14:25.936
I TOLD HIM I WAS IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE,

14:25.936 --> 14:27.938
AND HE FLEW INTO A RAGE.

14:30.340 --> 14:32.372
WILL YOU STOP LYING?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.304
IF YOU DON'T
TELL THE TRUTH SOON,

14:34.304 --> 14:36.306
YOU ARE SENDING
AN INNOCENT MAN TO JAIL.

14:36.306 --> 14:39.479
YOU ARE TAKING A FATHER
AWAY FROM HIS SON.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.952
IT'S MIKE'S FAULT,
NOT MINE.

14:41.952 --> 14:44.014
KATHERINE, PLEASE!

14:44.014 --> 14:49.459
EVEN THOUGH I AM
 SO ANGRY WITH HIM,

14:49.459 --> 14:51.461
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

14:51.461 --> 14:53.393
IT'S REALLY
KIND OF FLATTERING...

14:53.393 --> 14:57.527
TO GO THIS FAR TO KEEP ME
FROM BEING WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

15:02.472 --> 15:04.434
(sighs)

15:04.434 --> 15:06.576
SO HOW DID IT GO?

15:06.576 --> 15:08.508
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.511
I CAN'T TELL IF SHE'S CRAZY
OR JUST DEVIOUS.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.184
I THINK
SHE'S A LITTLE OF BOTH.

15:14.184 --> 15:17.547
OKAY. SO TELL ME HOW I GET
THE CRAZY PART COMMITTED.

15:17.547 --> 15:19.049
ONLY A FAMILY MEMBER

15:19.049 --> 15:21.051
CAN COMMIT SOMEBODY
TO AN INSTITUTION.

15:21.051 --> 15:23.123
REALLY?

15:26.356 --> 15:28.058
EXCUSE ME.

15:28.058 --> 15:30.360
I WAS JUST WITH
MY FRIEND KATHERINE IN 607,

15:30.360 --> 15:32.362
AND SHE WAS TALKING
TO HER DAUGHTER,

15:32.362 --> 15:34.604
AND SHE WANTED ME
TO FOLLOW UP ABOUT SOMETHING.

15:34.604 --> 15:36.606
DO YOU HAVE THAT NUMBER?

15:36.606 --> 15:39.309
(British accent)
DYLAN MAYFAIR?

15:39.309 --> 15:41.611
YES. WOULD YOU MIND
DIALING THAT NUMBER?

15:41.611 --> 15:43.373
CERTAINLY.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.446
THERE YOU GO.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.422
(imitates British accent)
HELLO.

15:52.422 --> 15:56.056
THIS IS DR. BREWSTER CALLING
FROM FAIRVIEW GENERAL.

15:56.056 --> 16:01.031
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE
JUST SPEAKING WITH YOUR MOTHER.

16:01.031 --> 16:03.393
RIGHT.

16:03.393 --> 16:05.465
WELL, I DO FEEL,
GIVEN HER CONDITION,

16:05.465 --> 16:09.469
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU
TO COME HERE IF YOU CAN.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.641
LOVELY.

16:11.641 --> 16:15.275
SEE YOU SOON.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.507
NOW THAT'S DEVIOUS.

16:26.756 --> 16:28.458
50 CENTS OFF PAPER TOWELS--

16:28.458 --> 16:29.759
THAT'S A GREAT COUPON.

16:29.759 --> 16:31.761
THIS IS FUN.
 YEAH, IT SURE IS.

16:31.761 --> 16:34.294
AND ME DOING MY OWN ROOTS
IS GONNA BE FUN,

16:34.294 --> 16:36.426
AND GETTING RID OF CABLE
IS GONNA BE FUN.

16:36.426 --> 16:38.998
WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING
SO MUCH FUN AROUND HERE.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.500
MOMMY?
 HMM?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.472
ARE WE POOR?

16:42.472 --> 16:45.505
OH. ONLY FINANCIALLY.

16:47.537 --> 16:50.280
HEY. HEY,
DON'T FORGET THAT ONE.

16:50.280 --> 16:53.083
RAVIOLI IN A CAN?
I LIKE POOR FOOD!

16:53.083 --> 16:55.645
(laughs)

17:00.019 --> 17:01.521
WHAT'D THEY SAY?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.523
I'VE ATTENDED CLASSES
FOR SIX WEEKS.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.425
(clears throat) THEY WON'T
REFUND ANY OF MY TUITION.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.358
UNBELIEVABLE.

17:08.358 --> 17:11.330
IS THERE A SIGN OVER US
THAT SAYS "CRAP HERE"?

17:11.330 --> 17:12.801
IT'LL BE OKAY.

17:12.801 --> 17:15.305
I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB,
AND IN THE MEANTIME,

17:15.305 --> 17:18.637
WE GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO LIVE ON
FOR THE NEXT... MM, FOUR MONTHS?

17:18.637 --> 17:21.371
SO WE'LL RUN OUT RIGHT BEFORE
THE BABIES ARE BORN.

17:21.371 --> 17:24.074
YES, BUT REMEMBER,

17:24.074 --> 17:26.246
KIDS DON'T MISS
WHAT THEY NEVER HAD.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.048
AH, LIKE FOOD, CLOTHING,
SOBER MOTHER?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.480
(chuckles)

17:33.383 --> 17:36.086
I AM SO SORRY.

17:36.086 --> 17:38.458
FOR WHAT?

17:38.458 --> 17:40.460
FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE
TO THIS FAMILY.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.263
YOU HAVE TO
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.595
PENNY IS CLIPPING COUPONS.

17:45.595 --> 17:49.439
I HAVE REALLY, REALLY
 SCREWED THIS UP.

17:49.439 --> 17:53.473
WELL, WE'LL GET SOME MONEY
IF WE WIN THE LAWSUIT.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.206
YEAH. WON'T THAT BE GREAT?

17:56.206 --> 18:01.481
LIVING OFF THE MONEY WE MADE
SUING OUR BEST FRIENDS.

18:01.481 --> 18:06.286
AT LEAST GABY TRIED
TO APOLOGIZE AND STOP THIS.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.288
WELL...

18:08.288 --> 18:10.390
MAYBE IT'S YOUR TURN.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.527
DAMN IT!

18:17.527 --> 18:19.569
WHATEVER IT IS,
I CAN EXPLAIN.

18:19.569 --> 18:21.571
THAT WAS THE CHAIRMAN
OF MY BOARD.

18:21.571 --> 18:24.234
THIS LYNETTE THING
IS TURNING INTO A FIASCO.

18:24.234 --> 18:27.237
I THOUGHT THAT LAWYER SAID
YOU DID EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK,

18:27.237 --> 18:28.578
THAT WE WERE COVERED.

18:28.578 --> 18:31.581
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THE LAWYER SAID.

18:31.581 --> 18:34.414
BOTTOM LINE IS, IT LOOKS BAD
FOR GLOBAL VENTURE--

18:34.414 --> 18:36.616
BIG CORPORATION GOING AFTER
A PREGNANT WOMAN.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.748
SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

18:38.748 --> 18:42.322
IF THIS SUIT GOES TO TRIAL...

18:42.322 --> 18:43.693
I'M DONE.

18:43.693 --> 18:47.457
AND EVEN IF IT DOESN'T,
I MIGHT STILL LOSE MY JOB.

18:47.457 --> 18:50.300
I'VE PUT EVERYTHING
INTO THIS COMPANY.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.432
CARLOS.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.563
CARLOS.

18:53.563 --> 18:55.565
(doorbell rings)

18:55.565 --> 18:57.867
(sighs)

19:00.210 --> 19:01.341
(sighs)

19:03.273 --> 19:05.275
HI. I KNOW I'M PROBABLY

19:05.275 --> 19:08.278
THE LAST PERSON
YOU WANT TO TALK TO.

19:08.278 --> 19:10.320
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.183
(door slams)

19:13.183 --> 19:15.885
IT'S, UH, DONE, KARL.

19:15.885 --> 19:18.888
ORSON SIGNED THE PAPERS.

19:18.888 --> 19:21.361
YES, UH, I KNOW.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.763
I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.765
I ABSOLUTELY
WANT TO SEE YOU, TOO.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.767
UH, MEET ME AT THE MOTEL,

19:27.767 --> 19:30.340
AND WE'LL FIND A WAY
TO CELEBRATE.

19:30.340 --> 19:33.743
TILL THEN, MY DARLING.

19:33.743 --> 19:35.405
(cell phone beeps)

19:35.405 --> 19:38.508
WHEN YOU MOVE ON,
YOU DON'T WASTE ANY TIME.

19:38.508 --> 19:40.450
(sighs)

19:40.450 --> 19:42.452
I'M SORRY.

19:42.452 --> 19:44.954
I WANTED
TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING,

19:44.954 --> 19:48.318
BUT I... FELT I'D HURT YOU
ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY.

19:48.318 --> 19:49.789
YES.

19:49.789 --> 19:53.293
MUCH BETTER
TO PARCEL OUT THE PAIN.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.365
IS IT SOMEONE I KNOW?

19:57.467 --> 20:00.300
NO, NO, NEVER MIND.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.332
I CAN'T HANDLE THAT RIGHT NOW.

20:02.332 --> 20:05.805
JUST, UH, TELL ME THIS...

20:05.805 --> 20:08.808
HAVE YOU TOLD YOUR FRIENDS
YOU'RE SEEING ANYONE?

20:08.808 --> 20:11.281
OF COURSE NOT.

20:11.281 --> 20:13.443
GOOD.

20:13.443 --> 20:15.485
PLEASE DON'T UNTIL I'M GONE.

20:15.485 --> 20:18.488
I'M SAYING GOOD-BYE TO EVERYONE
AT THE PARTY TOMORROW.

20:18.488 --> 20:22.292
I DON'T WANT IT TO TURN INTO
A PITY FEST FOR POOR ORSON.

20:23.853 --> 20:26.856
I WON'T GO PUBLIC
WITH MY NEW RELATIONSHIP

20:26.856 --> 20:28.598
UNTIL WE'RE DIVORCED.

20:30.660 --> 20:34.504
AND I'LL SAY WE STARTED
SEEING EACH OTHER...

20:34.504 --> 20:37.337
AFTER YOU AND I SEPARATE.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.310
WHAT A TASTEFUL SOLUTION.

20:40.310 --> 20:44.344
YOU MUST WRITE AN ETIQUETTE BOOK
FOR ADULTERERS.

20:47.577 --> 20:50.420
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR BEING ANGRY.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.422
AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD,

20:52.422 --> 20:55.555
I WILL NOT LET MY AFFAIR
BE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO YOU.

20:55.555 --> 20:58.257
SO WHEN THE PLANE FLIES OVER
THE CHRISTMAS PARTY,

20:58.257 --> 21:00.930
I WANT IT PULLING
A BIG-ASS BANNER THAT READS,

21:00.930 --> 21:04.033
"WILL YOU MARRY ME, BREE?

21:04.033 --> 21:05.895
LOVE, KARL."

21:05.895 --> 21:07.397
OH, ISN'T THAT ROMANTIC?

21:07.397 --> 21:08.998
GLORIOUS.
THAT'LL BE 600 BUCKS.

21:08.998 --> 21:12.342
I DON'T CARE.
YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON LOVE.

21:12.342 --> 21:14.344
HE CAN. OUR ANNIVERSARY?

21:14.344 --> 21:16.506
$20 GIFT CERTIFICATE
TO A RIB JOINT.

21:16.506 --> 21:18.508
WELL, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO COOK THAT NIGHT.

21:18.508 --> 21:20.580
SO THE GIFT
WAS FOR BOTH OF US.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.513
GOOD LUCK, MR. MAYER.

21:23.513 --> 21:25.515
I HOPE THIS BREE
SAYS YES...

21:25.515 --> 21:30.390
ALMOST AS MUCH AS I WISH
I HAD SAID NO.

21:30.390 --> 21:34.394
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I'M A DIVORCE LAWYER.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.995
OH, FOR GOD SAKE!

21:35.995 --> 21:39.068
JEFF, LOOK AT THE MESS
IN HERE!

21:39.068 --> 21:41.070
DO YOU HAVE A CARD?

21:55.845 --> 21:57.417
(Susan) DYLAN.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.588
DYLAN!

21:58.588 --> 22:01.020
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
TO YOU.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.393
I KNOW WHAT YOUR MOTHER
MUST HAVE TOLD YOU.

22:03.393 --> 22:05.555
IT'S WHAT SHE TOLD EVERYONE.
BUT IT'S NOT TRUE.

22:05.555 --> 22:08.558
DO YOU REALLY THINK I'M GONNA
TAKE YOUR WORD OVER HERS?

22:08.558 --> 22:11.060
PLEASE. I AM SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR MOM.

22:11.060 --> 22:13.763
I AM NOT JUST THINKING
ABOUT MIKE.
 THE HELL YOU'RE NOT.

22:13.763 --> 22:16.766
GET OVER HIM.
HE'S MARRIED TO MY MOTHER.

22:16.766 --> 22:18.768
WHAT?
 YOU KNOW, IT'S BAD ENOUGH

22:18.768 --> 22:21.070
THAT YOU MAKE A SCENE
AT THEIR WEDDING

22:21.070 --> 22:23.713
AND YOU HOUND THEM
NIGHT AND DAY.

22:23.713 --> 22:26.045
AND YOU STAB HER
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM?

22:26.045 --> 22:28.047
IS THAT WHAT SHE TOLD YOU?

22:28.047 --> 22:30.349
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE NOT
LOCKED UP RIGHT NOW.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.350
YOU'RE CRAZY.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.622
DYLAN!

22:32.622 --> 22:34.353
(dog barking in distance)

22:34.353 --> 22:36.626
WE NEED TO TALK.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.394
OH, MY GOD.

22:48.538 --> 22:50.400
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.642
FOR MONTHS,
MY MOM HAS BEEN TELLING ME

22:52.642 --> 22:54.644
ABOUT HER LIFE WITH MIKE--

22:54.644 --> 22:57.447
THE GIFTS THAT HE'S GIVEN HER
AND TRIPS THAT THEY'VE PLANNED.

23:00.610 --> 23:03.913
YOUR MOM NEEDS HELP.

23:03.913 --> 23:05.585
AND SO DOES MIKE.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.917
(sighs)

23:09.789 --> 23:12.091
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

23:16.466 --> 23:19.469
HEY, GOOD NEWS.

23:19.469 --> 23:21.571
DR. CHENG SAYS

23:21.571 --> 23:24.604
I CAN GIVE YOUR PARENTS
AN EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

23:24.604 --> 23:26.105
YOU'RE RELEASED.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.478
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.

23:34.183 --> 23:37.016
HEY, THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.888
HAPPY TO HELP.

23:38.888 --> 23:44.053
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW TOUGH IT IS
FOR YOU GUYS TO LIVE THIS WAY.

23:44.053 --> 23:45.925
WHAT WAY?

23:45.925 --> 23:47.927
RUNNING ALL THESE YEARS,

23:47.927 --> 23:49.929
ALWAYS LOOKING OVER
YOUR SHOULDER.

23:53.963 --> 23:58.107
RELAX, DANNY. YOUR PARENTS
TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR SITUATION.

23:58.107 --> 24:00.540
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I FIGURED IT OUT.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.642
YOUR MOM JUST
FILLED IN THE DETAILS.

24:05.214 --> 24:07.216
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

24:07.216 --> 24:09.719
WELL, FRANKLY,
I THINK SHE WAS GLAD

24:09.719 --> 24:12.522
TO FINALLY FIND SOMEONE
SHE COULD BE HONEST WITH.

24:12.522 --> 24:14.453
AND THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO.

24:14.453 --> 24:18.688
IF YOU EVER NEED TO TALK,
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

24:18.688 --> 24:21.631
(sighs) I HOPE SO.

24:21.631 --> 24:23.633
'CAUSE IF YOU SAY ANYTHING,

24:23.633 --> 24:25.665
THEY'RE GONNA
THROW MY MOM IN JAIL.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.197
NO, NO.
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.171
ARE YOU KIDDING?

24:34.073 --> 24:36.075
EVER SINCE 9/11,

24:36.075 --> 24:39.509
THE FEDS ARE HARD-CORE
ON ANY TERRORIST STUFF,

24:39.509 --> 24:42.782
EVEN THE OLD CASES.

24:42.782 --> 24:45.785
IF THEY FIND HER,
SHE'S DEAD.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.959
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:55.965 --> 24:57.967
DANNY!

24:57.967 --> 25:01.230
I THOUGHT WE WERE
PICKING YOU UP TOMORROW.
 MA, I SCREWED UP.

25:01.230 --> 25:03.132
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:06.205 --> 25:08.077
I TOLD MONA EVERYTHING.

25:20.650 --> 25:23.653
(car engine idling)

25:31.130 --> 25:34.033
HEY, MONA.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.135
THANKS FOR GIVING DANNY
A RIDE.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.137
AND, OH, I AM SO SORRY

25:38.137 --> 25:40.640
HE DRAGGED YOU INTO
OUR FAMILY DRAMA.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.049
(sighs) I MEAN,
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE

25:50.049 --> 25:52.882
WHAT A BAD HEAD SPACE
HE'S IN RIGHT NOW.

25:52.882 --> 25:57.056
HE'S SO ANGRY AT ME AND HIS DAD,
HE JUST WANTS TO HURT US,

25:57.056 --> 26:01.130
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN
THE WILD STORY HE JUST TOLD YOU.

26:03.132 --> 26:05.194
SO...

26:05.194 --> 26:07.096
WE GOOD?

26:07.096 --> 26:09.198
I HATE MY JOB.

26:09.198 --> 26:12.571
ALL I DO IS
DEAL WITH DISTURBED PEOPLE,

26:12.571 --> 26:14.674
WIPE THEIR DROOL,

26:14.674 --> 26:16.876
STRAP THEM DOWN.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.809
I HATE IT.

26:19.809 --> 26:21.280
WELL...

26:21.280 --> 26:24.283
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET
A DIFFERENT JOB.
 I WANTED TO,

26:24.283 --> 26:26.285
BUT THEY SAY YOU SHOULD HAVE

26:26.285 --> 26:29.018
A YEAR'S WORTH
OF LIVING EXPENSES.

26:29.018 --> 26:33.122
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE I'D GET THE MONEY.

26:33.122 --> 26:36.095
$67,000.

26:36.095 --> 26:39.268
THAT'S WHAT I'VE NEEDED
TO COVER MY MORTGAGE, MY CAR,

26:39.268 --> 26:41.771
EVERYTHING FOR A YEAR.

26:41.771 --> 26:43.372
(scoffs) MONA--

26:43.372 --> 26:45.935
67 GRAND.

26:45.935 --> 26:49.809
IF YOU COULD DO THAT
FOR ME,

26:49.809 --> 26:52.211
THEN WE'D ALL BE FREE.

27:00.289 --> 27:01.921
HEY, MOM.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.322
OH! (chuckles)

27:03.322 --> 27:05.154
DYLAN!

27:05.154 --> 27:08.157
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I-I ASKED YOU NOT TO COME.

27:08.157 --> 27:10.159
I HAD TO.

27:10.159 --> 27:12.001
YOU WERE HURT.

27:12.001 --> 27:14.964
HAVE YOU BEEN
TO THE HOUSE?

27:16.666 --> 27:21.070
OH, I'M SO SORRY MIKE
WASN'T THERE TO WELCOME YOU.

27:21.070 --> 27:22.712
HE'S AWAY ON BUSINESS.

27:24.974 --> 27:26.776
NO, HE'S IN JAIL.

27:26.776 --> 27:30.950
YOU TOLD THE POLICE
HE STABBED YOU.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.783
I... NEVER SAID THAT.

27:33.783 --> 27:36.856
I TOLD YOU--
SUSAN ATTACKED ME.

27:36.856 --> 27:39.428
THEN WHY DID THE POLICE
ARREST MIKE?

27:39.428 --> 27:43.092
I DON'T KNOW.

27:43.092 --> 27:48.667
MAYBE HE CONFESSED
TO PROTECT HER.

27:48.667 --> 27:52.141
MOM, SUSAN'S HIS WIFE.

27:52.141 --> 27:55.775
(scoffs) THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

27:55.775 --> 27:56.946
(laughs)

27:56.946 --> 27:59.108
WHAT--WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
SUSAN?

27:59.108 --> 28:00.910
NO. MIKE.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.315
THEY LET ME SPEAK
WITH HIM.

28:06.315 --> 28:08.317
MOM, MIKE IS IN JAIL,

28:08.317 --> 28:11.060
AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT
IF HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

28:16.465 --> 28:19.128
(sighs)
DID YOU STAB YOURSELF?

28:22.331 --> 28:25.104
MOM, DID YOU?

28:27.476 --> 28:30.309
(voice breaks)
I ASKED YOU NOT TO COME.

28:32.081 --> 28:33.412
OH, MOM.

28:33.412 --> 28:34.984
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

28:34.984 --> 28:37.947
SUSAN TRAPPED HIM,

28:37.947 --> 28:39.889
FILLED HIS HEAD WITH LIES.

28:39.889 --> 28:42.952
THIS IS GONNA SAVE HIM.

28:42.952 --> 28:46.926
HE KNOWS WHY I DID IT.
HE WANTS THIS.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.732
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

28:53.732 --> 28:56.435
I WANNA HELP YOU, KATHERINE.

29:03.172 --> 29:05.214
I HAVE TO GET TO MIKE.
 (slides tray)

29:05.214 --> 29:07.416
(sheets rumple)
 HE'S EXPECTING ME.

29:07.416 --> 29:10.079
I CAN FIX IT. YOU'LL SEE!
I HAVE TO GO!
 (woman) MRS. MAYFAIR, STOP!

29:10.079 --> 29:12.081
(Dylan) MOM, PLEASE.
 (woman) MRS. MAYFAIR!

29:12.081 --> 29:13.983
(panting)
 (Susan) OH! WE NEED
A LITTLE HELP HERE.

29:13.983 --> 29:15.324
MOM, PLEASE!

29:15.324 --> 29:18.087
EVERYTHING'S GONNA
BE WONDERFUL! (grunts)
 MOM!

29:18.087 --> 29:20.960
(crying) NO,
I HAVE TO GET TO MIKE!
 (man) WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

29:20.960 --> 29:23.462
NO! NO!
GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME!
 NEED SOME HELP HERE.
MRS. MAYFAIR, PLEASE!

29:23.462 --> 29:26.465
MRS. MAY--
 NO! NO! NO! (sobbing)

29:26.465 --> 29:30.840
PLEASE, MRS. MAYFAIR,
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.041
(gasps)

29:32.041 --> 29:33.903
OKAY, IT--IT--IT'S OKAY.

29:33.903 --> 29:36.045
HONEY, EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OKAY.

29:36.045 --> 29:38.047
(sighs)

29:40.349 --> 29:43.052
(softly) I ASKED YOU
NOT TO COME.

29:55.124 --> 29:58.567
HEY, WAIT UP.
I WANNA GO WITH YOU.
 CAN'T I HAVE
ONE MOMENT OF PEACE?

29:58.567 --> 30:01.070
OUR THERAPIST SAID WE NEED
TO DO MORE STUFF TOGETHER.

30:01.070 --> 30:04.073
I KNOW. THAT'S WHY I DON'T GO
TO THE THERAPIST WITH YOU.
 OH, COME ON.

30:04.073 --> 30:07.076
WOULD IT KILL YOU TO SPEND SOME
TIME WITH THE WOMAN YOU LOVE?

30:07.076 --> 30:11.881
I DON'T KNOW. WOULD YOU
BE UPSET IF I BROUGHT HER?
 AS LONG AS SHE DOESN'T
DEFLATE IN THE PLANE.

30:11.881 --> 30:16.185
("We Wish You
a Merry Christmas" playing)

30:16.185 --> 30:19.088
GABY, PLEASE TALK TO ME.
I FEEL JUST AWFUL.

30:19.088 --> 30:21.921
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE YOU ARE AWFUL.

30:21.921 --> 30:25.054
YOU'RE AN AWFUL PERSON.
 OKAY, YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT ME.

30:25.054 --> 30:28.057
THANKS, LYNETTE, AND YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO GO TO HELL.

30:28.057 --> 30:30.029
STOP TALKING TO ME!
 (scoffs)

30:30.029 --> 30:33.832
THANK YOU, ALL, FOR COMING OUT
TO OUR ANNUAL HOLIDAY FESTIVAL.

30:33.832 --> 30:37.036
AND, AS IT'S BEEN OUR TRADITION
THESE LAST 12 YEARS,

30:37.036 --> 30:40.910
PLEASE WELCOME BACK
THE JINGLE BELLES.

 I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WOULDN'T
LET YOU SING WITH THEM.

OH, BOO-HOO, YOU.

32:29.278 --> 32:32.281
WHY DON'T YOU SLIP YOUR CANKLES
INTO MY SHOES AND WALK A MILE?

32:32.281 --> 32:35.484
YOU JUST DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANYONE BUT YOURSELF.

32:35.484 --> 32:37.486
NO, I DO.
I CARE ABOUT MY FRIENDS.

32:37.486 --> 32:41.030

WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

32:59.378 --> 33:01.980
WE GOTTA TRY

33:01.980 --> 33:04.013
WE GOT
THE EMERGENCY 10 GRAND,

33:04.013 --> 33:06.115
BUT THAT IS A LONG WAY
FROM $67,000.

33:06.115 --> 33:07.716

33:10.019 --> 33:13.122

KARL? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
 I JUST THOUGHT I'D COME BY

33:28.377 --> 33:32.641
AND GIVE YOU
AN EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT.
 STOP IT!
WE CAN'T BE SEEN TOGETHER.

33:32.641 --> 33:34.313
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

33:34.313 --> 33:37.546
SUSAN KNOWS.
THE CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG.
 ORSON DOESN'T KNOW.

33:37.546 --> 33:40.549
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM?
 ABOUT THE AFFAIR, YES.
BUT HE HAS NO IDEA IT'S YOU.

33:40.549 --> 33:42.221
NOW, KARL, PLEASE GO.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.723

THERE'D BE NO SCENES TODAY.

 OH, LORD.

33:46.595 --> 33:47.696

33:47.696 --> 33:51.029
HEY, ORSON. JUST CAME BY
TO CHECK ON THE DECORATIONS.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.701
GREAT JOB, MRS. HODGE.

33:52.701 --> 33:54.703

I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

33:54.703 --> 33:56.335
ORSON, PLEASE.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.707
YOU OBVIOUSLY HEARD
BREE AND I ARE DIVORCING,

33:58.707 --> 34:00.709
AND, VULTURE THAT YOU ARE,

34:00.709 --> 34:04.443
YOU'VE SWOOPED IN TO MAKE A BUCK
BY REPRESENTING BREE.

34:05.814 --> 34:08.746
HEY, A MAN'S GOTTA EAT.

34:08.746 --> 34:12.521
PERHAPS. BUT SOLICITING BUSINESS
AT A CHRISTMAS PARTY?

34:12.521 --> 34:16.355
THAT'S TACKY,
EVEN FOR YOU, KARL.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.657

BUT FRANKLY, I THOUGHT
YOU HAD HIGHER STANDARDS.

34:27.366 --> 34:31.370
REMIND ME NOT TO LET HIM
MAKE A TOAST AT OUR WEDDING.
 IT'S NOT FUNNY, KARL.

34:31.370 --> 34:34.373
NOW JUST GO
BEFORE HE FIGURES IT OUT.
 YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

34:34.373 --> 34:37.074
UH, Y-YOU KNOW THAT
CHRISTMAS PRESENT I MENTIONED?

34:37.074 --> 34:40.078
DON'T YOU DARE GIVE ME A PRESENT
IN FRONT OF ALL THESE PEOPLE!

34:40.078 --> 34:43.812
I'M NOT SURE I CAN STOP IT.
IT'S BEING DELIVERED... BY AIR.

34:43.812 --> 34:47.815
KARL, WHAT DID YOU DO?
 JUST LET ME MAKE
ONE QUICK CALL.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.688
(sighs)

34:50.688 --> 34:53.161
(engine whirring)

34:53.161 --> 34:55.164
MAYDAY! MAYDAY!

34:55.164 --> 34:57.826

TURN THIS THING ON?

34:57.826 --> 34:59.598

(engine whirring, sign flaps)

35:14.513 --> 35:16.685
OKAY, I RELEASED THE BANNER.
NOW WHAT?

35:16.685 --> 35:18.647
(man over radio)
Look for a place to land--

35:18.647 --> 35:20.789
a field, a large parking lot.

35:20.789 --> 35:22.821
ALL I SEE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.823
Negative. Street landing
is too dangerous.

35:24.823 --> 35:28.427
WELL, THAT'S ALL THERE IS!
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!

35:28.427 --> 35:32.431
Okay, calm down.
Keep her steady.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.733
JEFF, IT'S KARL.
ARE YOU THERE?

35:34.733 --> 35:37.366
Hello?

35:37.366 --> 35:39.768
Come on, pick up. Okay.

IF YOU GET THIS MESSAGE,

35:41.710 --> 35:44.913

THIS MESSAGE--YOU NEED TO ABORT.

DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT FLY OVER
WISTERIA PARK WITH THAT BANNER.

35:47.776 --> 35:50.419
WHAT BANNER?
 CALL ME.

35:50.419 --> 35:52.321
KARL, WHAT BANNER?

35:52.321 --> 35:54.323
YOU KNOW HOW
YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING TO ME

35:54.323 --> 35:56.325
I SHOULD BE MORE ROMANTIC?
WELL, I THOUGHT,

35:56.325 --> 35:59.388
WHAT IF I HIRE A PLANE
TO FLY OVER BREE'S STREET

35:59.388 --> 36:01.730
CARRYING A BANNER WITH
A HEARTFELT PERSONAL MESSAGE?

36:01.730 --> 36:04.233
KARL, WHEN YOU PUT A MESSAGE
ON A BANNER,

36:04.233 --> 36:06.795
IT CEASES TO BE PERSONAL.
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

36:06.795 --> 36:08.797
UH, SOMETHING LIKE, UH...

36:08.797 --> 36:10.799
"BREE, WILL YOU MARRY ME?
LOVE KARL."

36:10.799 --> 36:13.642
OH, DEAR GOD!
 I WAS TRYING TO BE ROMANTIC.

36:13.642 --> 36:16.645
KARL, WHEN WE BEGAN THIS AFFAIR,
WE AGREED TO BE DISCREET.

36:16.645 --> 36:19.308
DO YOU KNOW WHAT DISCREET MEANS?
NO SKYWRITING!

36:21.350 --> 36:24.313

HOW HUMILIATED HE'LL BE?
