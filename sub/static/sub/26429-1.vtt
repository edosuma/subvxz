00:20.983 --> 00:24.851
In the year
2037, our world is dying.

00:24.853 --> 00:29.322
Mankind has been struck by
an infertility pandemic.

00:29.324 --> 00:31.257
Those who suffer
childbirth are awarded

00:31.259 --> 00:34.595
with a mere 15 seconds
of their babies' lives.

00:34.597 --> 00:37.431
Before the virus takes them.

00:37.433 --> 00:39.668
Anyone who tries this once,

00:40.503 --> 00:42.505
never attempts it again.

00:43.939 --> 00:46.108
The pain is just too much.

00:47.309 --> 00:49.175
While humanity is
united in our pain,

00:49.177 --> 00:50.577
we are sill divided.

00:50.579 --> 00:52.713
The political elite
and corporations

00:52.715 --> 00:54.981
are now indistinguishable.

00:54.983 --> 00:59.520
One company, Biocorp, now
rules with an iron fist.

00:59.522 --> 01:02.523
Those not connected with
or working for Biocorp

01:02.525 --> 01:04.658
live in the public sectors.

01:04.660 --> 01:06.493
Ghettos where we
eke out our lives,

01:06.495 --> 01:08.662
waiting for extinction
while Biocorp

01:08.664 --> 01:10.764
and their employees
enjoy the final luxuries

01:10.766 --> 01:12.298
life has to offer.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.800
Trapped in the border walls,

01:13.802 --> 01:15.536
and determined to
find a way to escape

01:15.538 --> 01:18.138
our dystopian country,
my friend Thomas and I

01:18.140 --> 01:19.740
used our scientific knowledge

01:19.742 --> 01:22.609
to build a prototype
teleportation device.

01:22.611 --> 01:24.511
Only we soon discovered
it didn't send matter

01:24.513 --> 01:26.580
to another point in space,

01:26.582 --> 01:28.782
but another point in time.

01:28.784 --> 01:31.585
20 years into the
past, we soon realized

01:31.587 --> 01:35.321
that we could travel
back in time to 2017.

01:35.323 --> 01:38.024
When Biocorp was
still in its infancy.

01:38.026 --> 01:40.393
And stop them from launching
their biometric chip

01:40.395 --> 01:42.028
that led to the
infertility pandemic

01:42.030 --> 01:44.831
that has doomed our species.

01:44.833 --> 01:46.633
But Biocorp realized this, too.

01:46.635 --> 01:48.969
And sent their
troops back after us.

01:48.971 --> 01:50.637
And our loved ones.

01:50.639 --> 01:52.405
My wife Jenny managed
to make it back

01:52.407 --> 01:57.243
to warn us, but, my sister,
Thomas' one true love,

01:57.245 --> 01:59.012
was executed by them.

01:59.014 --> 02:01.281
One of their soldiers
has made it back too,

02:01.283 --> 02:04.317
and is determined to kill
us by any means necessary.

02:04.319 --> 02:07.454
Now trapped in 2017, we
are running out of time

02:07.456 --> 02:09.523
until Biocorp discovers
how to replicate

02:09.525 --> 02:12.192
our time machines and
send more troops back.

02:12.194 --> 02:14.961
Grief-stricken, Thomas
will now stop at nothing

02:14.963 --> 02:16.362
to destroy the company.

02:16.364 --> 02:18.965
Even if it means
killing innocent people.

02:18.967 --> 02:21.034
I won't abandon my humanity,

02:21.036 --> 02:22.769
'cause I believe doing so

02:22.771 --> 02:25.872
will make us as evil as
those we seek to stop.

02:25.874 --> 02:28.509
One way or another,
we will stop them.

02:28.511 --> 02:30.210
The only question now, is:

02:30.212 --> 02:33.113
how many people will
die to make this happen?

03:27.235 --> 03:28.468
What are you typing?

03:28.470 --> 03:30.270
I'm taking notes on
her brain activity,

03:30.272 --> 03:32.205
her heart rate, her temperature
and her blood pressure.

03:32.207 --> 03:34.407
Just to make sure there's
no significant changes.

03:34.409 --> 03:35.542
I trust all you gentlemen are

03:35.544 --> 03:37.744
paying attention here, please.

03:37.746 --> 03:40.346
We're getting
it all down, sir.

03:40.348 --> 03:45.118
So, if this all works, I
decided not to execute you.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.654
And instead have you
work for Biocorp, but,

03:47.656 --> 03:50.926
I wouldn't be doing
this if it weren't.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.628
You could think about it,
but it's easy, really.

03:54.630 --> 03:57.532
Live, and work for
Biocorp, or die.

03:58.366 --> 03:59.332
The deal we had...

03:59.334 --> 04:01.369
Deal's changed, keep up.

04:03.806 --> 04:05.639
What are you
planning to do with it?

04:05.641 --> 04:07.774
You could destroy everything
by meddling with the past.

04:07.776 --> 04:10.076
I didn't create it.

04:10.078 --> 04:12.846
Those were your
meddlesome friends.

04:12.848 --> 04:14.581
You think they
had lofty motives?

04:14.583 --> 04:16.617
I'm sure they're
creating havoc already.

04:16.619 --> 04:19.019
No, they, stumbled
on it by accident.

04:19.021 --> 04:20.019
Oh, yes!

04:20.022 --> 04:21.922
This is clearly all an accident.

04:21.923 --> 04:24.257
No, it's true, they didn't
want any of this to happen.

04:24.259 --> 04:26.993
Well, be that as it may,

04:26.995 --> 04:31.231
I will use it to go back and
change things for the better.

04:31.233 --> 04:35.235
Tampering with the past could
threaten our very existence.

04:35.237 --> 04:37.738
Look, I will do
everything you want,

04:37.740 --> 04:39.407
but she has to live.

04:42.277 --> 04:44.477
Why would you risk
your life for her?

04:44.479 --> 04:46.847
'Cause that's just what
friends do for one another.

04:46.849 --> 04:47.683
Friends?

04:48.851 --> 04:51.685
The word friend has
no true meaning here.

04:51.687 --> 04:54.120
We are creatures
of want and need.

04:54.122 --> 04:57.626
Those you call friends
merely satisfy you.

05:00.763 --> 05:02.328
Think you're confused.

05:02.330 --> 05:04.698
Just put the gun
down and we can talk.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.299
Tell me about Biocorp.

05:06.301 --> 05:07.868
I don't know
anything about that.

05:07.870 --> 05:08.702
You're lying!

05:08.704 --> 05:09.636
It's all your fault!

05:09.638 --> 05:10.837
You're probably one of her,

05:10.839 --> 05:12.072
you started the whole
thing, didn't you?

05:12.074 --> 05:13.473
You tried it on your
child, didn't you?

05:13.475 --> 05:14.641
You're crazy, you're crazy!

05:14.643 --> 05:15.809
Do you think you're
better than us?

05:15.811 --> 05:17.143
I am crazy, but you're
a genocidal stain!

05:17.145 --> 05:19.247
You're a genocidal stain!

05:24.219 --> 05:25.952
Listen to me, listen to me.

05:25.954 --> 05:28.354
If you even come close
to making Biocorp

05:28.356 --> 05:31.024
succeed or support them,
I swear I'll kill you.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.258
Do you understand?

05:32.260 --> 05:33.093
Say you understand!

05:33.095 --> 05:34.362
I understand.

05:43.672 --> 05:45.438
All right, enough
time, do it now.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.272
No, it's not time.

05:46.274 --> 05:47.273
Do it now!

05:47.275 --> 05:48.608
Look at her brain activity!

05:48.610 --> 05:50.010
I don't care!

05:50.012 --> 05:51.712
Do what I say.

05:51.714 --> 05:53.313
Her brainwave patterns
say she's not asleep yet,

05:53.315 --> 05:55.348
if you wake her up
now, it'll kill her.

05:55.350 --> 05:57.150
I think you two
are up to something.

05:57.152 --> 05:58.584
You told me to run
the machine properly!

05:58.586 --> 06:00.020
To do that, she has
to be in stasis.

06:00.022 --> 06:02.555
And now I'm telling you

06:02.557 --> 06:04.157
to bring her back!

06:04.159 --> 06:06.059
What is the point of
knowing how it works

06:06.061 --> 06:08.795
if you won't let me
show you how it works?

06:08.797 --> 06:09.965
That's insane!

06:11.033 --> 06:12.034
Do it now.

06:13.168 --> 06:15.001
I will not kill her.

06:15.003 --> 06:17.237
You're not looking to kill,

06:17.239 --> 06:18.972
you're buying time.

06:18.974 --> 06:21.243
Step aside, we're finished.

06:23.445 --> 06:24.644
What do you want
me to do with him?

06:24.646 --> 06:26.246
Kill him.

06:26.248 --> 06:27.948
I won't have people
barking orders at me

06:27.950 --> 06:29.983
like I'm one of their pets.

06:29.985 --> 06:32.652
How will you figure the exact
way to bring someone back?

06:34.089 --> 06:35.488
Try on our own.

06:40.863 --> 06:41.696
Jenny!

06:52.440 --> 06:53.541
I missed you.

06:58.013 --> 06:59.014
It's done.

07:00.048 --> 07:00.981
What's happened to you?

07:00.983 --> 07:02.317
Jenny, my god!

07:05.187 --> 07:07.053
Is Lauren with you?

07:07.055 --> 07:08.654
No, she.

07:08.656 --> 07:11.224
What
happened, Jenny?

07:11.226 --> 07:12.893
They shot her.

07:12.895 --> 07:14.427
- They shot her!
- Who...

07:14.429 --> 07:15.295
Who do you think, Biocorp!

07:15.297 --> 07:16.298
The Speaker.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.299
What the
hell happened to her?

07:19.301 --> 07:20.266
I can't explain, now.

07:20.268 --> 07:21.501
Biocorp is at the apartment,

07:21.503 --> 07:23.403
and they're gonna pull
me back in six minutes.

07:23.405 --> 07:24.370
Sir, I think we should let him

07:24.372 --> 07:25.872
finish showing the scientists,

07:25.874 --> 07:28.174
he may be the only one left
who really knows the machine.

07:28.176 --> 07:30.443
He and that girl are
plotting against us

07:30.445 --> 07:32.378
right now in the past.

07:32.380 --> 07:33.847
They had no time to plan that.

07:33.849 --> 07:36.983
You and I, commander,
were alive in 2017.

07:36.985 --> 07:38.985
She could be hovering
over our young bodies,

07:38.987 --> 07:40.353
planning to kill
us in our sleep.

07:40.355 --> 07:41.421
I hope she is.

07:41.423 --> 07:42.255
You see?

07:42.257 --> 07:43.556
You're all the same.

07:43.558 --> 07:46.226
Power-hungry men without
a brain among you.

07:46.228 --> 07:48.895
And
you're all the same.

07:48.897 --> 07:51.731
So fierce in your convictions.

07:51.733 --> 07:54.236
As though they might save you.

07:55.737 --> 07:57.570
With all due respect, sir,

07:57.572 --> 07:58.939
I think we should let
the brain activity

07:58.941 --> 08:01.707
go to stasis like he says.

08:12.087 --> 08:13.088
Very well.

08:19.594 --> 08:21.995
Nico, look, I love
you and I miss you,

08:21.997 --> 08:23.329
but you have to let me go.

08:23.331 --> 08:25.031
I'm not gonna, I'm
not gonna lose you!

08:25.033 --> 08:25.999
I don't wanna go, either,

08:26.001 --> 08:27.500
but you have to knock me out.

08:27.502 --> 08:28.768
No, but, I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:28.770 --> 08:30.270
They're gonna wake
me in five minutes.

08:30.272 --> 08:31.404
No, no, David's
not gonna do that

08:31.406 --> 08:32.337
unless it's safe...

08:32.340 --> 08:33.573
David has a gun to his head

08:33.575 --> 08:34.941
- before I left
- I'm not gonna

08:34.943 --> 08:35.976
- lose you again!
- We have no other choice!

08:35.977 --> 08:37.443
Please, you have to let me go.

08:37.445 --> 08:38.811
Just put me under.

08:38.813 --> 08:40.313
Prepare the
adrenaline syringe.

08:40.315 --> 08:41.780
Let's get this process going.

08:41.783 --> 08:42.815
You, you can't kill her!

08:42.817 --> 08:44.317
I told you, you're finished.

08:44.319 --> 08:45.518
Wait!

08:45.520 --> 08:47.620
If you let her live,
I will help you!

08:47.622 --> 08:48.754
I will tell you everything
about the machine,

08:48.756 --> 08:51.457
I will work for Biocorp
like you wanted.

08:51.459 --> 08:53.493
With my help, you
could use this device

08:53.495 --> 08:55.896
to take over the world.

08:55.898 --> 08:57.830
There are secrets
about this machine

08:57.832 --> 09:01.601
that I will tell you
only if you let her live.

09:01.603 --> 09:02.437
Really?

09:03.605 --> 09:04.439
All right.

09:05.640 --> 09:09.142
Except, you will tell
us these secrets now.

09:09.144 --> 09:10.944
Or I guarantee you,

09:10.946 --> 09:12.547
I will let her die.

09:13.715 --> 09:14.981
Why can't I just
stay here with you?

09:14.983 --> 09:16.182
No, no, no, no, no,
you can't, you can't.

09:16.184 --> 09:17.017
Why?

09:17.019 --> 09:18.251
You can't, because.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.685
'Cause if you're
asleep there and,

09:19.687 --> 09:20.586
you might die!

09:20.588 --> 09:21.823
I don't care!

09:24.292 --> 09:25.491
I wanna be with you.

09:25.493 --> 09:27.894
I wanna be with the
man that I love.

09:27.896 --> 09:28.964
I love you.

09:30.665 --> 09:33.001
I'm so sorry about Lauren.

09:34.169 --> 09:36.002
It's not your fault,
it's not your fault.

09:36.004 --> 09:37.904
It's okay, it's.

09:37.906 --> 09:40.106
David, he risked
his life for her.

09:40.108 --> 09:41.274
It's not your fault.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.643
They just, they killed
her in cold blood.

09:43.645 --> 09:45.278
It's okay, just
stay here with me.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.112
Stay with me, okay?

09:46.114 --> 09:47.247
Just be with me.

09:47.249 --> 09:48.083
I am.

09:49.217 --> 09:50.650
I am.

09:50.652 --> 09:52.585
Please, just, just
let her fall asleep,

09:52.587 --> 09:54.154
you know this'll kill her.

09:54.156 --> 09:56.089
What are these secrets?

09:56.091 --> 09:57.723
Wake her up properly, first.

09:57.725 --> 10:00.226
We know
the machine works.

10:00.228 --> 10:01.928
We have enough
information to carry on

10:01.930 --> 10:04.364
without you, or without her.

10:04.366 --> 10:06.101
What are the secrets?

10:07.169 --> 10:09.771
You do this, I'll never tell.

10:12.774 --> 10:15.108
You've got nothing.

10:15.110 --> 10:15.942
The adrenaline.

10:15.944 --> 10:16.776
Wait.

10:16.778 --> 10:17.610
Tell me the secrets.

10:17.612 --> 10:18.444
I will when you,

10:18.446 --> 10:19.545
wait, wait, wait!

10:19.547 --> 10:21.716
Without me, you will fail!

10:25.553 --> 10:26.386
Back, back!

10:26.388 --> 10:27.289
Back, back!

10:28.690 --> 10:29.522
Get back!

10:29.524 --> 10:30.425
Go farther!

10:31.293 --> 10:32.125
Shots fired!

10:32.127 --> 10:33.561
Move, move, move!

10:44.306 --> 10:45.138
No, no, no!

10:45.140 --> 10:45.974
No, no!

10:59.287 --> 11:00.455
She'll live.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.726
In a better future.

11:09.297 --> 11:10.132
No, no!

11:17.872 --> 11:20.973
How could you let this happen!

11:20.975 --> 11:22.408
You all right?

11:22.410 --> 11:25.378
I remember this
headache, it's okay.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.447
Are, are they
trying to wake me?

11:27.449 --> 11:29.982
They disconnected you, honey.

11:29.984 --> 11:30.818
How?

11:32.587 --> 11:35.021
Must've had no choice.

11:35.023 --> 11:36.322
You're here now.

11:36.324 --> 11:37.957
Can't go back.

11:37.959 --> 11:40.160
I don't care, I just
wanna be here with you.

11:40.162 --> 11:41.563
I know, I know.

11:43.131 --> 11:43.965
It's okay.

11:45.767 --> 11:49.135
We need to
find Thomas, babe.

11:49.137 --> 11:52.705
She loved him, you
know that, don't you?

11:52.707 --> 11:53.875
She loved you.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.350
Move in, now,
check your corners!

12:04.352 --> 12:06.018
Oh, thank heavens!

12:06.020 --> 12:08.656
Like usual, you're just in time!

12:21.469 --> 12:24.904
Get me a new team, and
get rid of these bodies!

12:24.906 --> 12:25.807
Yes, sir.

12:27.242 --> 12:28.408
What now?

12:28.410 --> 12:29.842
What now?

12:29.844 --> 12:31.344
I don't know!

12:31.346 --> 12:35.350
But thanks to you, we do
know how to go one way!

12:47.462 --> 12:48.296
Hello?

12:49.431 --> 12:51.264
Hello, is
this Mrs. Kyla Torres?

12:51.266 --> 12:52.798
Yes, speaking.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.201
Mrs. Torres, this
is Dr. Raymond Prentice

12:55.203 --> 12:57.069
at the New Jersey
Fertility Center.

12:57.071 --> 12:58.971
Yes, hello Doctor,
how you doing?

12:58.973 --> 13:01.107
Very well,
thank you for asking.

13:01.109 --> 13:02.742
I'm calling in regards
to the recent tests

13:02.744 --> 13:04.910
that you've undergone
here at the hospital.

13:04.912 --> 13:06.679
Yes, yes, Doctor.

13:06.681 --> 13:08.681
How'd they come out?

13:08.683 --> 13:10.716
Well, Mrs. Torres,

13:10.718 --> 13:13.686
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this.

13:13.688 --> 13:16.389
There's really no easy
way of saying it, but,

13:16.391 --> 13:17.523
all of the tests have come back

13:17.525 --> 13:19.859
and they're fairly conclusive.

13:19.861 --> 13:23.131
In fact, they are
100% conclusive.

13:24.266 --> 13:27.933
I'm afraid you are
completely infertile.

13:27.935 --> 13:30.570
Beyond adoption or surrogacy,

13:30.572 --> 13:34.006
I'm afraid you will
never have children.

13:45.353 --> 13:48.020
Mrs.
Torres, are you there?

13:48.022 --> 13:49.455
Mrs. Torres?

13:49.457 --> 13:52.392
You and our future
share something in common.

13:52.394 --> 13:53.395
Infertility.

13:56.864 --> 13:57.865
Oh my god.

14:00.001 --> 14:01.102
He was right.

14:03.371 --> 14:04.472
He was right!

14:10.845 --> 14:11.677
Hey, Thomas.

14:11.679 --> 14:12.745
Thomas!

14:12.747 --> 14:13.879
You crazy?

14:13.881 --> 14:15.281
Put the gun down!

14:15.283 --> 14:17.116
We're committed here, Nico.

14:17.118 --> 14:18.551
Right?

14:18.553 --> 14:20.286
We came here with a job to do,

14:20.288 --> 14:22.488
and now we have to finish it.

14:22.490 --> 14:25.092
Right, but, put the gun down.

14:28.296 --> 14:30.698
What, did you lose your mind?

14:31.899 --> 14:33.235
Where's Jenny?

14:34.336 --> 14:35.237
She's uh.

14:39.407 --> 14:41.008
She's in the motel.

14:43.945 --> 14:45.947
How is she still here?

14:47.615 --> 14:51.052
David, is uh, he
did what he had to do.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.522
She's here with us now.

14:55.657 --> 14:56.591
Lucky me.

14:57.625 --> 14:59.527
Always the third wheel.

15:00.662 --> 15:02.830
It's gonna be okay, bud.

15:04.198 --> 15:06.532
I feel so alone, Nico.

15:06.534 --> 15:09.371
In a way I thought
I'd never feel.

15:12.307 --> 15:14.073
We're in this together.

15:14.075 --> 15:14.909
I know.

15:16.143 --> 15:18.646
We're gonna find a way home.

15:21.749 --> 15:24.085
What are we going home to?

15:25.387 --> 15:26.454
The future.

15:27.422 --> 15:29.389
The future, buddy.

15:29.391 --> 15:31.125
We've got the future.

15:32.860 --> 15:33.961
The future.

15:36.097 --> 15:36.998
The future!

15:38.566 --> 15:39.932
You have your future!

15:39.934 --> 15:41.634
You have Jenny, you
have everything!

15:41.636 --> 15:42.870
Lauren is gone!

15:43.971 --> 15:45.905
The future without Lauren?

15:45.907 --> 15:47.172
For me?

15:47.174 --> 15:50.109
There is nothing left to see.

15:50.111 --> 15:51.744
- I understand, but...
- No!

15:51.746 --> 15:53.212
No, no you don't.

15:53.214 --> 15:54.246
No you don't!

15:54.248 --> 15:55.615
I get that you loved her.

15:55.617 --> 15:57.216
I get that she's your sister.

15:57.218 --> 15:59.285
I really do, Nico, I really do.

15:59.287 --> 16:01.787
But you did not
love her like I did.

16:01.789 --> 16:02.888
That is not my fault!

16:02.890 --> 16:04.324
- That is not my fault!
- Yes it is!

16:04.326 --> 16:05.725
Because you allowed
this to happen.

16:05.727 --> 16:08.663
We left them when
we shouldn't have.

16:15.470 --> 16:17.204
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16:18.573 --> 16:19.505
I didn't mean it.

16:19.507 --> 16:21.407
- I'm so sorry.
- Okay.

16:27.315 --> 16:28.750
It's all right.

16:30.385 --> 16:31.617
I'm not blaming you.

16:31.619 --> 16:35.254
I know exactly, exactly
where the blame lies.

16:35.256 --> 16:37.590
We need to get our
heads straight, okay?

16:37.592 --> 16:39.058
We're in danger.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.626
What danger are we in?

16:40.628 --> 16:42.061
Jenny told me everything.

16:42.063 --> 16:44.029
They got the machine,
they're sending people back.

16:44.031 --> 16:46.131
They're gonna be quick,
they're gonna be brutal.

16:46.133 --> 16:47.633
It doesn't matter.

16:47.635 --> 16:48.768
It doesn't matter, Nico.

16:48.770 --> 16:51.837
Here, Biocorp aren't the bully.

16:51.839 --> 16:53.072
Here, we're the killers.

16:53.074 --> 16:55.875
Biocorp, they're just babies.

16:55.877 --> 16:57.545
We're not killers.

16:58.413 --> 16:59.914
We're not killers!

17:00.815 --> 17:02.715
Yes we are, Nico.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.148
We've killed.

17:04.151 --> 17:06.486
How many people have we killed?

17:06.488 --> 17:09.154
So many I don't even remember.

17:09.156 --> 17:10.623
And we need to kill a few more.

17:10.625 --> 17:13.425
We need to, we need to
kill just a few more.

17:13.428 --> 17:14.960
We need to kill every employee,

17:14.962 --> 17:17.363
every colleague, every
investor, every friend,

17:17.365 --> 17:20.900
every mother, every child of
anything to do with Biocorp.

17:20.902 --> 17:24.303
We have to leave
nobody standing.

17:24.305 --> 17:27.575
We didn't move here
to kill children.

17:28.976 --> 17:29.811
Thomas.

17:34.949 --> 17:36.682
If we leave Biocorp
standing, Nico,

17:36.684 --> 17:38.853
that's exactly what we do.

17:46.327 --> 17:51.196
The global biological
clock is ticking against us.

17:51.198 --> 17:52.299
At this time.

17:57.605 --> 18:00.940
Almost as if I'd
wrote it myself.

18:00.942 --> 18:02.007
I can't believe
everyone thinks

18:02.009 --> 18:05.210
that's the real John Williams.

18:05.212 --> 18:06.879
Well I'm not interested
in being famous,

18:06.881 --> 18:09.884
I just wanna fix
this big mess here.

18:20.361 --> 18:21.195
Kyla.

18:24.466 --> 18:26.165
You again!

18:26.167 --> 18:27.567
Me again.

18:27.569 --> 18:28.400
I just want you to know,

18:28.402 --> 18:29.334
I haven't done anything.

18:29.336 --> 18:31.236
I haven't done anything wrong!

18:31.238 --> 18:32.073
Kyla!

18:33.140 --> 18:35.675
I'm not here about that today.

18:35.677 --> 18:38.444
Okay, well, I took your
warning very seriously,

18:38.446 --> 18:40.412
and it's been all
I can think about,

18:40.414 --> 18:42.381
- and I even went to...
- Kyla, Kyla!

18:42.383 --> 18:43.315
What?

18:43.317 --> 18:46.085
I'm here to ask for a favor.

18:46.087 --> 18:46.921
What?

18:49.691 --> 18:51.090
I need you to
help me with access

18:51.092 --> 18:53.859
to the Biocorp internal network.

18:53.861 --> 18:56.095
No, I
can't do it, I've

18:56.097 --> 18:58.764
oh my god.

18:58.766 --> 18:59.699
Shut up.

18:59.701 --> 19:00.633
Shut up, Kyla.

19:00.635 --> 19:02.804
- Calm down.
- Stop talking.

19:03.971 --> 19:05.771
I need the names and addresses

19:05.773 --> 19:07.540
of every Biocorp employee.

19:07.542 --> 19:08.373
What?

19:08.375 --> 19:09.609
Why do you need that?

19:09.611 --> 19:12.411
Stop talking and
start listening!

19:12.413 --> 19:13.646
Okay, okay.

19:13.648 --> 19:15.314
Because the more you
talk, the angrier I get.

19:15.316 --> 19:17.182
The angrier I get,
the more I remember.

19:17.184 --> 19:19.652
You killed a whole
load of my friends!

19:19.654 --> 19:21.153
And then I just wanna
blow your brains out.

19:21.155 --> 19:22.724
Okay, okay, okay.

19:23.658 --> 19:26.191
We can access it from my house.

19:26.193 --> 19:27.126
Okay?

19:27.128 --> 19:28.060
We can do that.

19:28.062 --> 19:30.029
We can do that at my house.

19:30.031 --> 19:31.063
Okay?

19:31.065 --> 19:32.297
- Okay?
- Is this your car?

19:32.299 --> 19:34.266
Yes, yes it's
right here, yeah.

19:34.268 --> 19:35.603
Then let's go.

19:39.173 --> 19:40.272
Okay.

19:40.274 --> 19:41.275
After you.

19:56.390 --> 19:59.661
You know, you really
don't need that.

20:00.562 --> 20:01.961
Actually, I do.

20:01.963 --> 20:04.797
Because I don't trust
anybody or anything.

20:04.799 --> 20:07.299
I told you that
you can trust me.

20:09.103 --> 20:11.503
After seeing what you've
become in the future.

20:11.505 --> 20:12.940
Right, I'll pass.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.141
So what?

20:16.143 --> 20:19.947
No faith that humans can
change for the better?

20:21.649 --> 20:23.282
Not really.

20:23.284 --> 20:25.186
What happened to you?

20:26.187 --> 20:28.923
What made you so
goddamn cynical?

20:31.158 --> 20:33.292
Oh nothing big.

20:33.294 --> 20:37.262
Just all my friends
and all my family died.

20:37.264 --> 20:39.965
Everybody I've ever
known is gonna die.

20:39.967 --> 20:43.202
And the woman I
love, I left to die.

20:43.204 --> 20:46.338
I saw society tear
itself apart for an idea.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.610
It was supposed to save us.

20:49.510 --> 20:51.877
All from your company.

20:51.879 --> 20:54.647
But that's not my fault!

20:54.649 --> 20:56.050
Actually it is.

20:58.452 --> 21:00.686
But you can change that.

21:00.688 --> 21:03.357
Put all the information on this.

21:13.668 --> 21:15.336
Whatever you want.

21:24.345 --> 21:25.179
Okay.

21:27.414 --> 21:28.714
This is everything.

21:28.716 --> 21:29.550
Done!

21:30.918 --> 21:32.419
Well done, Kyla.

21:33.587 --> 21:36.155
What you're doing
is saving lives.

21:36.157 --> 21:38.059
Starting with your own.

21:40.427 --> 21:42.461
Don't forget what I said.

21:42.463 --> 21:45.297
Don't do anything stupid.

21:45.299 --> 21:46.300
I promise.

21:47.769 --> 21:48.770
We'll see.

22:01.082 --> 22:04.083
God, give me the
serenity to accept

22:04.085 --> 22:05.851
the things I cannot change

22:05.853 --> 22:09.254
and the courage to
change the things I can

22:09.256 --> 22:13.058
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

22:13.060 --> 22:13.895
Oh my god!

22:26.607 --> 22:28.209
- Commander.
- Sir.

22:29.510 --> 22:30.344
Report.

22:31.445 --> 22:33.445
We've completed
repairs on the machine,

22:33.447 --> 22:35.147
and after reviewing
David's notes,

22:35.149 --> 22:39.284
I think we're ready to successfully
send back a volunteer.

22:39.286 --> 22:40.287
Well done.

22:43.758 --> 22:44.591
Hm.

22:47.895 --> 22:48.730
Hm.

22:50.297 --> 22:51.632
You may proceed.

22:53.801 --> 22:55.768
I'll inform the President.

22:55.770 --> 22:56.704
Yes, sir.

23:16.290 --> 23:17.624
Hey, you okay?

23:20.094 --> 23:21.829
Yeah, I'll be okay.

23:23.865 --> 23:25.998
She died trying
to save your life.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.900
She never gave up.

23:27.902 --> 23:29.935
Not until the end.

23:29.937 --> 23:30.938
So stubborn.

23:32.139 --> 23:34.809
She kinda reminds me of someone.

23:37.078 --> 23:39.144
I know he loved her.

23:39.146 --> 23:42.247
My father loved her
so much more than me.

23:42.249 --> 23:45.785
I was pretty much
invisible to him.

23:45.787 --> 23:47.719
Think that's why I hated her.

23:47.721 --> 23:48.622
Growing up.

23:49.757 --> 23:51.757
Well that, and she
used to steal my toys.

23:53.127 --> 23:54.860
Well you got over
that eventually, right?

23:54.862 --> 23:55.995
Yeah.

23:55.997 --> 23:56.898
Yeah I did.

23:59.500 --> 24:02.601
You know, for the
longest time, she was,

24:02.603 --> 24:04.538
she was my only friend.

24:05.639 --> 24:08.810
And you
meant the world to her.

24:10.044 --> 24:11.643
God, it's my fault!

24:11.645 --> 24:12.611
No, it's not!

24:12.613 --> 24:13.913
I shouldn't have left, Jenny.

24:13.915 --> 24:14.746
You had to!

24:14.748 --> 24:16.483
No, I had a choice!

24:18.085 --> 24:18.918
We should go.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.487
No, no, no, just.

24:23.090 --> 24:25.557
Look, I knew they were
gonna raid the apartment.

24:25.559 --> 24:27.426
I felt it in my gut,
and you know what,

24:27.428 --> 24:30.295
I still took the chance on it.

24:30.297 --> 24:32.631
And I left you guys alone.

24:32.633 --> 24:34.035
Her and, I don't.

24:35.569 --> 24:38.804
We went on this stupid mission
to save the world, and,

24:38.806 --> 24:40.172
it just made everything worse.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.942
No, you did what
you had to do.

24:46.147 --> 24:48.713
A lot of people
have had to die.

24:48.715 --> 24:49.781
A lot.

24:49.783 --> 24:52.251
Babe, you are a good man.

24:52.253 --> 24:54.153
You've always been a good man.

24:54.155 --> 24:55.220
How do you know?

24:55.222 --> 24:56.355
Because I am married to you,

24:56.357 --> 24:58.824
and I see it day in and day out.

24:58.826 --> 25:00.292
And, if what I say isn't enough

25:00.294 --> 25:02.427
to convince you, just know that,

25:02.429 --> 25:04.629
the doctor told me
that you are too.

25:04.631 --> 25:05.699
He made it?

25:06.533 --> 25:07.432
Yeah.

25:07.434 --> 25:09.003
It was in our time.

25:10.171 --> 25:11.238
He helped us.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.674
I didn't think he'd
remember after all this time.

25:15.676 --> 25:17.977
How could he forget, you
saved his father's life.

25:17.979 --> 25:18.944
That was Thomas.

25:18.946 --> 25:20.779
No, it was both of you.

25:20.781 --> 25:22.147
He hadn't seen you in 20 years,

25:22.149 --> 25:24.783
and he still gave his
last moments to you.

25:24.785 --> 25:26.218
Doesn't that speak volumes?

25:26.220 --> 25:27.819
Yeah, but.

25:27.821 --> 25:29.688
You know just, it's
just been hard.

25:29.690 --> 25:33.861
A lot of people have had to
die so we can save lives.

25:34.695 --> 25:35.895
I know.

25:35.897 --> 25:37.963
It's been hard for all of us.

25:37.965 --> 25:41.200
- And Thomas, he's...
- Thomas.

25:41.202 --> 25:43.135
He doesn't have anyone.

25:43.137 --> 25:44.805
He never really did.

25:45.907 --> 25:47.806
I don't know
what he's gonna do.

25:47.808 --> 25:50.644
It's Thomas we're
talking about.

25:55.116 --> 25:56.081
Hello!

25:57.218 --> 25:58.052
Hi!

25:59.253 --> 26:01.020
What is it that you have, there?

26:01.022 --> 26:02.955
It's my ladybug.

26:02.957 --> 26:04.323
Oh, it's a big one.

26:04.325 --> 26:06.325
It's the biggest
I've ever seen.

26:08.129 --> 26:09.361
It's pretty.

26:09.363 --> 26:11.196
I'm gonna take
it home as a pet.

26:11.198 --> 26:13.465
Oh,
that's nice of you.

26:13.467 --> 26:15.634
My brother's gonna hate it!

26:15.636 --> 26:18.503
He doesn't like
creepy crawly things.

26:18.505 --> 26:19.638
Your brother?

26:19.640 --> 26:21.240
I bet he's nice to you.

26:21.242 --> 26:22.942
Not when he's sleepy.

26:26.513 --> 26:28.914
Do you wanna hold it?

26:28.916 --> 26:29.814
Who, me?

26:29.816 --> 26:31.550
Yes, you, silly!

26:31.552 --> 26:32.386
Okay!

26:34.956 --> 26:35.789
Wow!

26:36.790 --> 26:39.224
She's pretty like you.

26:39.226 --> 26:41.226
Can I have it back now?

26:41.228 --> 26:42.329
Yeah, sure.

26:44.731 --> 26:46.831
I have to go feed him.

26:46.833 --> 26:49.101
You know lettuce
is good for ladybugs.

26:49.103 --> 26:50.669
How do you know?

26:50.671 --> 26:52.071
How do I know?

26:52.073 --> 26:54.106
I used to have a
ladybug as a pet.

26:54.108 --> 26:54.940
Really?

26:54.942 --> 26:56.141
Yeah.

26:56.143 --> 26:56.976
My sister used to
bring them home to me

26:56.978 --> 26:58.210
when I was a little boy.

26:58.212 --> 27:00.412
That's what I do!

27:00.414 --> 27:01.680
Sweetie!

27:01.682 --> 27:02.616
Time to go!

27:03.550 --> 27:05.417
I have to go now.

27:05.419 --> 27:06.251
Bye!

27:06.253 --> 27:07.588
Okay, bye-bye.

27:44.891 --> 27:46.491
What's for dinner?

27:46.493 --> 27:49.694
Oh my god, okay.

27:49.696 --> 27:51.997
So are you trying to
give me a heart attack?

27:51.999 --> 27:53.665
Perhaps.

27:53.667 --> 27:55.434
What do you want now?

27:55.436 --> 27:56.270
What?

27:57.538 --> 28:00.839
I can see why you're
a childless skellum.

28:00.841 --> 28:02.674
Why because I can't cook?

28:02.676 --> 28:05.579
No because you
don't deserve one.

28:07.148 --> 28:08.047
What?

28:08.049 --> 28:08.882
Wait?

28:10.051 --> 28:12.219
Wait did something happen?

28:13.687 --> 28:14.521
Oh yes.

28:15.489 --> 28:18.390
Things have changed Kyla.

28:18.392 --> 28:21.493
I gave you
everything you wanted.

28:21.495 --> 28:22.861
- I gave it to you all,
- Not quite.

28:22.863 --> 28:23.695
I gave it to you.

28:23.697 --> 28:26.598
Not quite.

28:26.600 --> 28:30.802
You left out a vital
piece of information.

28:30.804 --> 28:32.537
And I'm not sure why.

28:32.539 --> 28:35.074
I don't know what
you're talking, okay.

28:35.076 --> 28:39.811
I asked you for a list of
every single Biocorp employee.

28:39.813 --> 28:41.046
Okay, okay.

28:41.048 --> 28:42.381
And what did you give me?

28:42.383 --> 28:44.051
Everybody in the US.

28:44.885 --> 28:46.285
Wait, I'm...

28:46.287 --> 28:48.953
Why would you do that?

28:48.955 --> 28:50.722
Because I just wasn't
thinking clearly,

28:50.724 --> 28:52.791
and you're always
holding a gun to my head

28:52.793 --> 28:55.026
and you didn't ask me
exactly what you wanted!

28:55.028 --> 28:56.395
Okay, okay, okay.

28:56.397 --> 28:57.929
Well I need everybody.

28:57.931 --> 28:59.631
Okay, we'll.

28:59.633 --> 29:00.899
So do you understand
what I want?

29:00.901 --> 29:02.401
Okay, yes, yes!

29:02.403 --> 29:04.569
Then get it for me, Kyla.

29:04.571 --> 29:06.938
Okay, I can do that.

29:06.940 --> 29:07.874
Okay, okay.

29:09.776 --> 29:10.611
Okay.

29:17.451 --> 29:18.285
Okay.

29:28.595 --> 29:30.095
Did I ever tell you, Kyla,

29:30.097 --> 29:33.967
that you really remind me
of somebody I once knew?

29:36.203 --> 29:39.504
She had beautiful
eyes just like you.

29:39.506 --> 29:42.276
Smile that could
light up a room.

29:44.778 --> 29:47.646
But she's not here anymore.

29:47.648 --> 29:49.483
Because of you people.

29:53.987 --> 29:54.821
Okay.

29:58.425 --> 29:59.260
Okay.

30:00.194 --> 30:01.027
Okay.

30:03.830 --> 30:05.630
How long, Kyla?

30:05.632 --> 30:07.699
Okay, it's coming.

30:07.701 --> 30:09.234
It's coming right now.

30:09.236 --> 30:12.036
Okay, just give me
one, just give me.

30:12.038 --> 30:12.973
Okay, okay.

30:15.509 --> 30:17.344
It's coming out, okay.

30:18.412 --> 30:19.246
Okay.

30:20.514 --> 30:21.348
Okay.

30:22.749 --> 30:26.017
These are all of the Biocorp
employees in the world.

30:26.019 --> 30:28.353
Tokyo, London, and Paris,
you have everything now,

30:28.355 --> 30:29.621
it's in your hands.

30:29.623 --> 30:30.555
That's it, I gave you
everything you wanted.

30:30.557 --> 30:31.392
That's it.

30:32.593 --> 30:34.826
There's nobody
missing from this list?

30:34.828 --> 30:37.496
No, I promise, this is it.

30:37.498 --> 30:38.930
I promise.

30:38.932 --> 30:40.665
I believe you.

30:40.667 --> 30:41.800
You wouldn't lie
to me, would you?

30:41.802 --> 30:43.101
No, no, no!

30:43.103 --> 30:44.769
I told you, I told you!

30:44.771 --> 30:47.174
I told you, you can trust me!

30:49.743 --> 30:53.914
I'm sorry, Kyla, I just
can't take the risk anymore.

31:02.856 --> 31:04.155
Commander.

31:04.157 --> 31:05.390
Our volunteer's
ready to go, sir.

31:05.392 --> 31:06.991
There's a change of plans.

31:06.993 --> 31:08.427
Sir?

31:08.429 --> 31:12.331
The President demanded
that we no longer waste time.

31:12.333 --> 31:14.799
He instructed me to
send my best soldier

31:14.801 --> 31:17.402
to hunt down and kill
these three traitors

31:17.404 --> 31:19.838
if they are still alive.

31:19.840 --> 31:22.407
I'll complete this mission
for Biocorp personally, sir.

31:22.409 --> 31:25.178
Commander, I am
counting on it.

31:29.950 --> 31:33.287
You're
dismissed, get out.

31:38.225 --> 31:40.292
So I believe he shot that girl

31:40.294 --> 31:42.327
because he knew she
would be disconnected

31:42.329 --> 31:43.730
and safe in 2017.

31:45.499 --> 31:46.333
I agree.

31:47.568 --> 31:51.270
I think they must
all still be alive.

31:51.272 --> 31:53.039
You must find them.

31:54.441 --> 31:55.376
And then?

31:59.780 --> 32:00.614
Yes, sir.

32:02.649 --> 32:04.516
Son, is it ready?

32:04.518 --> 32:05.917
Yes, sir.

32:05.919 --> 32:07.721
Well give it to him!

32:09.823 --> 32:10.755
Thank you.

32:10.757 --> 32:12.023
What's this?

32:12.025 --> 32:14.526
Assuming they did what
they're supposed to do,

32:14.528 --> 32:15.894
this will allow you to locate

32:15.896 --> 32:18.830
every member of
the Biocorp family.

32:18.832 --> 32:20.432
Chip locator.

32:20.434 --> 32:21.266
Let's see.

32:24.638 --> 32:26.771
Working
perfectly, sir.

32:26.773 --> 32:28.875
Working perfectly, sir.

32:30.277 --> 32:32.977
Commander, we are pulling
you back in 24 hours.

32:32.979 --> 32:36.948
If you don't accomplish
your mission by then,

32:36.950 --> 32:39.751
don't bother to put
yourself to sleep.

32:39.753 --> 32:40.687
Understand?

32:42.188 --> 32:43.922
Understood.

32:43.924 --> 32:44.925
Good luck.

32:53.834 --> 32:56.770
Let's start this
process, please?

33:10.617 --> 33:12.050
Thomas?

33:12.052 --> 33:13.084
Hello?

33:13.086 --> 33:15.186
Please call me back, 'kay?

33:15.188 --> 33:17.924
We've been calling
you for hours.

33:19.893 --> 33:22.162
All right, please, call me.

33:23.397 --> 33:24.998
I hope he's okay.

33:28.635 --> 33:30.369
Maybe he just needs time alone,

33:30.371 --> 33:33.505
you know, after
everything that happened.

33:33.507 --> 33:35.474
Well I didn't go run and hide.

33:35.476 --> 33:36.541
Son of a bitch.

33:36.543 --> 33:37.476
Nico!

33:37.478 --> 33:38.977
Everyone mourns differently.

33:38.979 --> 33:42.583
Yeah, but he could've
at least called me.

33:45.519 --> 33:47.218
Where the hell have you been?

33:47.220 --> 33:49.053
I've been taking
care of things.

33:49.055 --> 33:52.256
That need to be taken care of.

33:52.258 --> 33:55.226
And I got a little
drunk on the way.

33:55.228 --> 33:56.797
Where did you go?

33:57.664 --> 33:58.830
I killed Kyla.

33:58.832 --> 33:59.764
Who?

33:59.766 --> 34:01.265
An infertile Biocorp employee.

34:01.267 --> 34:04.903
- Thomas, you can't just...
- Why not?

34:04.905 --> 34:07.205
She had information we needed.

34:07.207 --> 34:08.139
Now I have it.

34:08.141 --> 34:09.541
Yeah, but she understood.

34:09.543 --> 34:12.210
What about second chances?

34:12.212 --> 34:15.716
There's no second
chances anymore, Nico.

34:18.918 --> 34:21.152
What's this, huh?

34:21.154 --> 34:23.621
That's the name,
address, and next-of-kin

34:23.623 --> 34:27.291
of every Biocorp employee
in the whole wide world.

34:27.293 --> 34:29.561
How many people
are on this list?

34:29.563 --> 34:31.231
- 1,980.
- Dear god.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.569
Thomas, there's no way
we're gonna convince

34:37.571 --> 34:40.103
that many people of anything.

34:40.106 --> 34:43.341
I'm not trying to talk
anybody into anything anymore.

34:43.342 --> 34:45.444
What do you mean?

34:45.446 --> 34:47.512
What he means, Jenny,
he's talking about

34:47.514 --> 34:48.847
killing all these people.

34:48.849 --> 34:50.214
What?

34:50.216 --> 34:52.083
What are you, a
mass murderer, now?

34:52.085 --> 34:52.985
Is that it?

34:54.721 --> 34:55.719
You know what?

34:55.722 --> 34:56.655
I haven't been here long enough

34:56.657 --> 34:58.189
to hear you two guys' plan.

34:58.191 --> 35:00.091
But if it's any better
than mine, I'm all ears.

35:00.093 --> 35:01.325
Well you know,
any plan is better

35:01.327 --> 35:03.327
than killing 2,000
people, Thomas!

35:03.329 --> 35:05.697
Those people on that list,

35:05.699 --> 35:07.098
they deserve to die.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.033
They don't deserve to be.

35:09.035 --> 35:10.368
Are you kidding me?

35:10.370 --> 35:13.404
Have you forgotten
what they did to us?

35:13.406 --> 35:15.507
What they will do.

35:15.509 --> 35:16.741
What?

35:16.743 --> 35:18.977
They haven't done
anything yet, Thomas.

35:18.979 --> 35:21.012
But they will!

35:21.014 --> 35:23.482
So what, you're
the judge, the jury,

35:23.484 --> 35:24.849
and the executioner, now?

35:24.851 --> 35:26.618
Is that what you are?

35:26.620 --> 35:28.386
- Judging me, again?
- Yeah.

35:28.388 --> 35:29.721
Talking down to
me, because I've got

35:29.723 --> 35:32.390
slightly more blood on
my hands than you do?

35:32.392 --> 35:33.692
No, I've never quite been able

35:33.694 --> 35:35.694
to get up to that Nico
standard as usual,

35:35.696 --> 35:36.895
- no.
- I have never.

35:36.897 --> 35:38.129
- I have never...
- No, no, I won't

35:38.131 --> 35:39.330
let you down, I'm not
good enough for you,

35:39.332 --> 35:40.799
I've never been
good enough for you.

35:40.801 --> 35:42.000
- I have never done that!
- And I've never been

35:42.002 --> 35:44.636
good enough for
your sister, either!

35:44.638 --> 35:46.505
You keep her out of this.

35:46.507 --> 35:48.306
What a surprise.

35:48.308 --> 35:49.373
We're not gonna talk about her.

35:49.375 --> 35:51.976
Both of you just stop!

35:51.978 --> 35:55.046
Listen, Thomas, we
don't have the time

35:55.048 --> 35:56.648
or the resources to reach out

35:56.650 --> 35:58.883
to all these people
in the globe.

35:58.885 --> 36:02.186
Then we wait for a time
when everyone on that list

36:02.188 --> 36:04.255
is in the same place
at the same time,

36:04.257 --> 36:05.824
which isn't as hard
as you might think.

36:05.826 --> 36:07.892
Don't you worry, buddy,
I got it covered.

36:07.894 --> 36:08.827
You need to stop drinking.

36:08.829 --> 36:10.995
Give me that drink, it's enough.

36:10.997 --> 36:14.334
I have had not
nearly enough to drink!

36:15.335 --> 36:17.536
And that is still a good plan!

36:17.538 --> 36:18.803
What about this
butterfly effect

36:18.805 --> 36:20.138
you always talk about, huh?

36:20.140 --> 36:21.606
That's 2,000 people.

36:21.608 --> 36:22.974
I don't know.
That's a lot bigger than

36:22.976 --> 36:23.908
- what you're talking about!
- I don't know!

36:23.910 --> 36:25.476
But isn't it worth trying?

36:25.478 --> 36:27.411
Just think about it, guys.

36:27.413 --> 36:29.814
Please, for a minute,
think about it.

36:29.816 --> 36:33.417
If everybody on that list
goes, Biocorp is gone.

36:33.419 --> 36:34.855
It doesn't exist.

36:35.722 --> 36:37.088
Our home is safe, we can go home

36:37.090 --> 36:38.456
and we can toast to a world

36:38.458 --> 36:40.859
without genocidal
criminals on our doorsteps!

36:40.861 --> 36:43.394
You're calling them genocidal?

36:43.396 --> 36:45.063
Absolutely.

36:45.065 --> 36:47.198
Then what does that make you?

36:47.200 --> 36:48.967
A goddamn hero.

36:48.969 --> 36:50.203
Goddamn hero.

36:54.608 --> 36:56.941
The names on this
list, all the information

36:56.943 --> 36:58.677
is enough to save
the whole world,

36:58.679 --> 37:00.679
all we have to do is execute it.

37:00.681 --> 37:01.880
That's it.

37:01.882 --> 37:03.281
Please.

37:03.283 --> 37:07.385
Look, I am not killing
2,000 people, Thomas!

37:07.387 --> 37:09.087
But it will save six billion

37:09.089 --> 37:11.024
so what does it matter?

37:12.092 --> 37:13.524
What is there to think about?

37:13.526 --> 37:15.026
What is there,
it's a no-brainer!

37:15.028 --> 37:16.327
It's a coward's solution!

37:16.329 --> 37:18.062
It's simple statistics, Nico!

37:18.064 --> 37:19.463
You need to sober up.

37:19.465 --> 37:21.332
It'll save Lauren.

37:21.334 --> 37:23.935
It would save Lauren,
do you get that!

37:23.937 --> 37:25.670
Did you hear the
professor said?

37:25.672 --> 37:27.371
We cannot change the past!

37:27.373 --> 37:28.339
I'm not trying
to change the past,

37:28.341 --> 37:29.741
I'm trying to fix our future!

37:29.743 --> 37:32.145
That's this future, Thomas!

37:33.313 --> 37:35.413
What we experienced
was the future, okay?

37:35.415 --> 37:37.081
What happened, happened.

37:37.083 --> 37:38.650
No, no, 'cause we're here,

37:38.652 --> 37:40.284
we're changing
things all the time!

37:40.286 --> 37:41.219
- Yes, but...
- Every minute!

37:41.221 --> 37:42.420
I know we're changing things,

37:42.422 --> 37:45.790
we're changing the
future, not the past!

37:45.792 --> 37:48.559
You don't know
for sure, do you?

37:48.561 --> 37:50.895
You don't know that.

37:50.897 --> 37:52.465
You won't even try?

37:53.433 --> 37:54.267
And you?

37:58.772 --> 38:01.305
Then I'll do it alone.

38:01.307 --> 38:02.573
I'll save her.

38:02.575 --> 38:04.242
- I'll save us all.
- So smart.

38:04.244 --> 38:05.443
- Don't worry, I won't need
- You're really smart.

38:05.445 --> 38:06.577
- Any of your help.
- You know that, Thomas?

38:06.579 --> 38:07.145
- Thomas!
- You're so smart!

38:07.147 --> 38:08.680
What!

38:08.682 --> 38:10.183
We all lost her.

38:11.752 --> 38:12.585
All of us.

38:14.287 --> 38:16.755
Yeah, but you know what?

38:16.757 --> 38:18.456
We've got a chance to save her.

38:18.458 --> 38:20.892
And he chooses not to.

38:20.894 --> 38:22.393
Look at him standing there,

38:22.395 --> 38:26.898
staring at me, looking at
me like I'm the coward.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.232
- Huh, what?
- Stop, stop!

38:28.234 --> 38:29.734
Stop it!

38:29.736 --> 38:31.035
She wouldn't want
you to do this!

38:31.037 --> 38:32.303
Get away from me!

38:32.305 --> 38:34.472
Stop it, you're
both best friends!

38:34.474 --> 38:36.307
Did you forget about that?

38:36.309 --> 38:37.711
Yeah, I forgot.

38:39.579 --> 38:41.345
You know what else, Jen?

38:41.347 --> 38:43.982
Doesn't really matter what
Lauren would've wanted.

38:43.984 --> 38:45.583
She's not here anymore.

38:45.585 --> 38:46.419
Is she?

38:55.328 --> 38:57.028
It's gonna be okay.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.029
He needs to sober up, right?

38:58.031 --> 39:00.433
I don't know, I don't know.

39:04.404 --> 39:05.806
We're losing him.

39:09.209 --> 39:11.409
I think we already lost him.

39:11.411 --> 39:13.246
You know what, babe?

39:15.048 --> 39:17.617
You know what the sad thing is?

39:19.252 --> 39:21.822
I, I can't even say he's wrong.

39:22.789 --> 39:24.655
Maybe we can't save the world.

39:24.657 --> 39:25.957
Maybe it's not a possibility.

39:25.959 --> 39:29.229
We just have to save
as many as we can.

39:30.163 --> 39:32.432
I already lost my sister.

39:33.633 --> 39:34.735
And now this.

39:37.904 --> 39:38.739
No, no.

39:44.745 --> 39:48.346
He's the one that
we have to save.

39:48.348 --> 39:50.915
Don't give up on him.

39:50.917 --> 39:53.019
He's talking out of love.

40:12.038 --> 40:13.371
They told me you
were still here.

40:13.373 --> 40:15.974
Where else would I be?

40:15.976 --> 40:16.908
What is it?

40:16.910 --> 40:19.412
What's wrong, is it the rebels?

40:22.415 --> 40:25.116
I was thinking about Jack.

40:25.118 --> 40:26.352
- Jack?
- Yeah.

40:28.421 --> 40:31.489
You know it's been like 20
years now, you realize that?

40:31.491 --> 40:33.624
I know he meant a lot to you.

40:33.626 --> 40:36.396
And yet you never
talk about him.

40:37.964 --> 40:42.135
I think about him a lot
more often than you realize.

40:43.503 --> 40:44.969
Well you think
these men, these ones

40:44.971 --> 40:46.470
who traveled from the past,

40:46.472 --> 40:48.807
you think they killed him?

40:48.809 --> 40:51.577
I think it makes
perfect sense.

40:55.315 --> 40:58.482
I've seen that look
in your eye before.

40:58.484 --> 41:00.253
Think before you act.

41:01.321 --> 41:02.620
You know somethin'?

41:02.622 --> 41:04.122
The last thing in the
world I need right now

41:04.124 --> 41:07.691
is a lecture from you about
how I'm supposed to act,

41:07.693 --> 41:09.193
and what I'm supposed to do.

41:09.195 --> 41:11.495
Because I already did
everything I could,

41:11.497 --> 41:12.596
they way you wanted.

41:12.598 --> 41:14.298
What I want?

41:14.300 --> 41:16.000
I see you don't want a child.

41:16.002 --> 41:17.869
You want us to die out.

41:17.871 --> 41:19.537
I abused my power.

41:19.539 --> 41:21.005
I trifled with my power.

41:21.007 --> 41:22.773
I did everything I
could in my power

41:22.775 --> 41:25.209
to get what you wanted.

41:25.211 --> 41:26.446
You're right.

41:27.814 --> 41:30.781
I'm just, I'm just
trying to help you

41:30.783 --> 41:32.483
do what's best for all of us,

41:32.485 --> 41:37.055
and part of that is what's
best for you and me.

41:37.057 --> 41:38.689
I'm trying.

41:38.691 --> 41:40.693
We did this once before.

41:41.761 --> 41:43.096
You almost died.

41:44.230 --> 41:45.731
Forgot about that.

41:52.672 --> 41:53.506
Let's not.

41:54.607 --> 41:56.607
I wanna have a child.

41:56.609 --> 41:58.642
Of course I do.

41:58.644 --> 42:01.479
I just don't wanna lose
you in the process.

42:01.481 --> 42:02.315
Okay?

42:22.468 --> 42:23.303
Hmph.

42:48.161 --> 42:48.995
Excellent.

42:50.096 --> 42:53.099
This'll be the easiest
hunt of my life.

42:58.704 --> 43:01.005
Today, Nobel Peace
Prize-winning Biocorp

43:01.007 --> 43:04.642
made history by administering
the cure for cancer

43:04.644 --> 43:06.710
available to the entire
world's population

43:06.712 --> 43:08.612
in exchange for their
voluntary enrollment,

43:08.614 --> 43:11.382
compulsory enrollment
in the ID chip program.

43:11.384 --> 43:14.085
Which allows for increased
populations, security.

43:14.087 --> 43:17.155
Biocorp's CEO stated,
"In time, we understand

43:17.157 --> 43:20.224
"that the only thing worth
fighting for is family,

43:20.226 --> 43:23.094
"and today is a day when
we must decide to fight

43:23.096 --> 43:26.532
"for what's right, or
roll over and die."

43:27.800 --> 43:30.034
That's all for tonight.

43:30.036 --> 43:31.569
We're all clear.

43:31.571 --> 43:32.572
Thank you.

43:33.974 --> 43:35.308
Come here, babe.

43:41.181 --> 43:42.480
Was it a good news day?

43:42.482 --> 43:43.714
I don't know, baby.

43:43.716 --> 43:45.984
We're gonna have to
wait and find out.

43:45.986 --> 43:47.986
What's going to happen now?

43:47.988 --> 43:49.320
I don't know.

43:49.322 --> 43:51.022
But things are going to change.

43:51.024 --> 43:52.323
- Mrs. Adams.
- Yes?

43:52.325 --> 43:54.158
I'm David Johnson
from Biocorp.

43:54.160 --> 43:56.260
Both of you come with me.

43:56.262 --> 43:57.097
Now!

43:58.931 --> 44:00.266
Okay, come on.

44:08.274 --> 44:09.673
Yeah, babe.

44:09.675 --> 44:11.909
See, Thomas has the list,

44:11.911 --> 44:14.245
so we can't warn
everyone ahead of time.

44:14.247 --> 44:16.380
He's not gonna go
through the entire list.

44:16.382 --> 44:19.083
Plus, the police would
catch him here in this time.

44:20.286 --> 44:21.119
What's that?

44:21.121 --> 44:23.123
Why is this going off?

44:25.558 --> 44:26.690
Is that your tracker?

44:26.692 --> 44:28.626
Yeah, David
programmed it for me.

44:28.628 --> 44:29.827
Oh.

44:29.829 --> 44:30.961
Well we can use
this to find Thomas!

44:30.963 --> 44:32.430
No, someone else is here.

44:32.432 --> 44:33.931
Babe, that's
Thomas right there.

44:33.933 --> 44:36.867
No, there's a fourth signal.

44:36.869 --> 44:38.836
Maybe it's David.

44:38.838 --> 44:41.139
No, you and I know
that's unlikely.

44:41.141 --> 44:43.341
Well if it's not
David, it's not friendly.

44:43.343 --> 44:45.443
And whoever it is,
they are moving fast.

44:45.445 --> 44:46.610
We need to get
outta here, then.

44:46.612 --> 44:49.513
Wherever we go,
they're gonna track us.

44:49.515 --> 44:51.349
All right, let me think, okay?

44:51.351 --> 44:53.084
All right, so, Thomas
said that everyone

44:53.086 --> 44:56.587
on that list, that they're
from all over the globe.

44:56.589 --> 44:57.821
So uh...

44:57.823 --> 44:59.190
So you think he's
gonna fly everywhere?

44:59.192 --> 45:01.392
No, it's too slow.

45:01.394 --> 45:02.228
I know!

45:03.563 --> 45:04.828
What?

45:04.830 --> 45:06.830
If you don't have a
way to go to everyone.

45:06.832 --> 45:08.799
You bring everyone to you.

45:08.801 --> 45:12.536
Exactly, he's trying to attack
everyone at the same time.

45:12.538 --> 45:13.571
I have an idea.

45:13.573 --> 45:14.838
What?

45:14.840 --> 45:16.840
David, he put an
AI on my tracker.

45:16.842 --> 45:18.344
Good boy, David!

45:20.580 --> 45:22.246
We can have the
AI, it'll link over

45:22.248 --> 45:23.281
to the computer
system, maybe we can

45:23.283 --> 45:25.383
have internet in this time.

45:25.385 --> 45:27.451
Okay, moment of truth.

45:27.453 --> 45:29.287
Computer, do you
have internet access?

45:29.289 --> 45:30.288
Yes, of course.

45:30.290 --> 45:32.456
What would you like to see?

45:32.458 --> 45:35.626
Adam, pull the database for
any upcoming Biocorp events.

45:35.628 --> 45:38.162
I have access to a
public calendar for Biocorp.

45:38.164 --> 45:39.863
There is a staff
gala this Friday,

45:39.865 --> 45:41.099
would you like the details?

45:41.101 --> 45:41.934
Yes.

45:42.868 --> 45:43.967
Bingo!

45:43.969 --> 45:47.338
There it is,
everybody on the list.

45:47.340 --> 45:48.674
We gotta move.

45:52.011 --> 45:55.513
You know it's a good thing
I went back and you stayed.

45:55.515 --> 45:58.516
I never could have
built that thing.

45:58.518 --> 46:01.587
You're very versatile,
you know that?

46:02.655 --> 46:04.288
Having doubts?

46:04.290 --> 46:06.124
Hey, I get it.

46:06.126 --> 46:07.325
I mean, of course you are,

46:07.327 --> 46:08.759
you're not some
kind of psychopath.

46:08.761 --> 46:09.927
If you weren't having doubts,

46:09.929 --> 46:12.696
then I'd be worried about ya.

46:12.698 --> 46:15.535
This is a serious
move, my friend.

46:17.703 --> 46:19.537
I mean, not like what you've

46:19.539 --> 46:22.442
already been doing
isn't, but this?

46:23.876 --> 46:25.711
This is the next step.

46:26.846 --> 46:29.780
This is where you've
been heading all along.

46:29.782 --> 46:33.784
And it's been a dark
road the whole way.

46:33.786 --> 46:34.818
Have you thought
about how many people

46:34.820 --> 46:37.688
are gonna be there tonight?

46:37.690 --> 46:40.360
I mean, really thought about it?

46:41.461 --> 46:45.196
People with families,
with children.

46:45.198 --> 46:47.798
2,000 people with
hopes and dreams,

46:47.800 --> 46:49.367
and you're gonna turn
them all into corpses

46:49.369 --> 46:51.371
in the span of a second.

46:54.674 --> 46:57.275
You know what 2,000
people is Thomas?

46:57.277 --> 46:58.878
- Shut up.
- Do you?

47:00.079 --> 47:04.250
It's 0.0022% of how many
are gonna get killed

47:08.554 --> 47:10.290
in the riots of 2021.

47:11.891 --> 47:16.061
It's 0.000029% of the
population of this world,

47:19.932 --> 47:23.934
all of whose futures are
being determined here.

47:23.936 --> 47:24.770
Now.

47:25.738 --> 47:26.572
By you.

47:27.873 --> 47:30.741
So you push that button
and don't even pretend

47:30.743 --> 47:33.078
you've gotta think about it.

47:36.649 --> 47:38.616
I mean, hey, let's
not kid ourselves.

47:38.618 --> 47:41.452
What you're doin' is

47:41.454 --> 47:42.855
a horrible thing.

47:44.657 --> 47:47.325
You're already a
murderer, buddy, but this?

47:47.327 --> 47:49.429
This makes you a butcher.

47:50.630 --> 47:52.296
What you do tonight,

47:52.298 --> 47:54.465
will haunt your dreams.

47:54.467 --> 47:56.367
For the rest of your life.

47:56.369 --> 47:57.735
Stop.

47:57.737 --> 47:58.969
So really at this point,

47:58.971 --> 48:02.575
there's only one thing
you gotta ask yourself:

48:05.345 --> 48:08.281
how much is your
sleep really worth?

48:10.115 --> 48:11.717
One horrifying act,

48:15.488 --> 48:17.990
for the future of all mankind.

48:20.192 --> 48:21.193
And for her.

48:24.430 --> 48:26.096
I guess if he's
talking from your head,

48:26.098 --> 48:28.200
that makes me your heart.

48:29.569 --> 48:31.837
You can't escape your fate.

48:33.706 --> 48:36.309
Maybe it's our time to bow out.

48:37.743 --> 48:40.913
Everything and
everyone has it's time.

48:44.284 --> 48:45.951
The only tragedy is,

48:47.553 --> 48:48.788
we missed ours.

48:53.959 --> 48:57.761
I'm going to see
you again, my love.

48:57.763 --> 48:58.931
And when I do,

49:01.867 --> 49:04.203
I wanna recognize your face.

49:09.442 --> 49:12.111
Don't save me and lose yourself.

49:55.555 --> 49:59.022
Yeah, yeah I'm on my way
from work right now, actually.

49:59.024 --> 50:00.524
- Yeah I know...
- Excuse me, officer.

50:00.526 --> 50:01.925
Uh, hey, yeah man,
what's going on?

50:01.927 --> 50:03.794
Could you tell me
where Collie Avenue is?

50:03.796 --> 50:05.228
- Collie Avenue?
- Yeah.

50:05.230 --> 50:08.167
Yeah, actually
if you head over...

50:15.941 --> 50:20.611
Love
these old antiques.

50:20.613 --> 50:22.346
- I need you to hear me out.
- What?

50:22.348 --> 50:23.614
We need to stop Thomas?

50:23.616 --> 50:24.848
I, I, I know that.

50:24.850 --> 50:26.650
No, no, no, we need
to do whatever it takes.

50:26.652 --> 50:27.851
What do you
mean, whatever it takes?

50:27.853 --> 50:29.286
We can't let him
kill all those people!

50:29.288 --> 50:31.722
I know, but I'm not
gonna kill Thomas!

50:31.724 --> 50:33.957
Okay, I'm not playing this
kill or be killed game.

50:33.959 --> 50:36.093
So what, you're gonna try to
talk him down off the ledge?

50:36.095 --> 50:37.027
I mean have you seen him?

50:37.029 --> 50:38.228
Yeah, I saw him, baby.

50:38.230 --> 50:39.930
Just, just, you know
what, just stop.

50:39.932 --> 50:41.532
Let me just talk
to him first, okay.

50:41.534 --> 50:42.866
Talk to him, Nico,
you are not the one

50:42.868 --> 50:44.635
he wants to talk to.

50:45.771 --> 50:47.337
All right, you're right.

50:47.339 --> 50:48.173
All right.

51:01.487 --> 51:03.587
Last chance to
change your mind.

51:03.589 --> 51:05.489
I don't wanna change my mind.

51:05.491 --> 51:06.990
Bye!

51:06.992 --> 51:08.759
Well, I guess we're
really gonna do this thing.

51:08.761 --> 51:11.529
Yeah, it looks that way.

51:11.531 --> 51:14.064
Is he going to work?

51:14.066 --> 51:15.733
Yeah.

51:15.735 --> 51:18.070
Workin' hard for his family.

51:19.905 --> 51:22.508
Reminds me of someone I know.

51:38.591 --> 51:40.493
Still never fixed it.

52:21.266 --> 52:22.399
Sorry, sis.

52:34.647 --> 52:35.646
Who the hell are you!

52:35.648 --> 52:36.446
- Where are you
- No, listen!

52:36.448 --> 52:37.414
Taking my baby!

52:37.416 --> 52:38.348
Mom, mom, mom, listen!

52:38.350 --> 52:39.382
- Help!
- Mom!

52:39.384 --> 52:40.217
- Somebody help me!
- Mom!

52:40.219 --> 52:41.184
Mom, mom, look, okay!

52:41.186 --> 52:42.385
Look, I'm your son!

52:42.387 --> 52:43.754
I know it's hard to
believe, it's me, Nico!

52:43.756 --> 52:44.822
Look I broke my
arm in the basement

52:44.824 --> 52:46.456
working with Jimmy Finkle, okay?

52:46.458 --> 52:49.793
I used to eat ice cream in
a special bowl with bananas,

52:49.795 --> 52:52.095
do you remember, when
I was four, okay?

52:52.097 --> 52:53.063
We don't have much time.

52:53.065 --> 52:53.997
Okay.

52:53.999 --> 52:55.232
Listen, I'm gonna let you go.

52:55.234 --> 52:56.033
Mom, but you cannot
scream, you understand?

52:56.035 --> 52:57.267
Do you promise?

52:57.269 --> 52:58.736
Okay.

53:02.341 --> 53:04.074
Who are you people?

53:04.076 --> 53:05.543
You look so much like, uh...

53:05.545 --> 53:07.344
I know, I need
you to focus, okay?

53:07.346 --> 53:08.946
Okay, look, I'm your son.

53:08.948 --> 53:11.549
I'm all grown up,
this, this is my wife.

53:11.551 --> 53:13.483
Jenny, we're from the future.

53:13.485 --> 53:14.518
Hi.

53:14.520 --> 53:15.986
We're here to save Lauren.

53:15.988 --> 53:17.387
What?

53:17.389 --> 53:18.889
Something horrible happened
to her in the future.

53:18.891 --> 53:20.457
Okay, we have a
chance to save her.

53:20.459 --> 53:21.959
If you let her come with me.

53:21.961 --> 53:23.360
It's not possible!

53:23.362 --> 53:25.629
Yes, listen, you
have to believe me.

53:25.631 --> 53:28.532
Listen, she deserves to
live a good, full life.

53:28.534 --> 53:30.100
What, what happened to her?

53:30.102 --> 53:32.202
If you help us, she'll grow up

53:32.204 --> 53:33.571
to be a beautiful woman.

53:33.573 --> 53:35.505
Marry the man of her
dreams, have kids,

53:35.507 --> 53:37.841
have a family, but if you don't,

53:37.843 --> 53:39.476
she's gonna die!

53:39.478 --> 53:40.944
I don't understand!

53:40.946 --> 53:45.115
You are at school, and
now you are so old!

53:45.117 --> 53:46.316
It's been a long time.

53:46.318 --> 53:47.450
My son?

53:47.452 --> 53:48.652
My son?

53:48.654 --> 53:50.487
Even if I believe
you, how can I let you

53:50.489 --> 53:52.322
take my little girl?

53:52.324 --> 53:54.224
We're here to save Lauren.

53:54.226 --> 53:55.826
We're here to save Lauren, okay?

53:55.828 --> 53:57.260
Nico, we have to go.

53:57.262 --> 53:59.963
Okay, listen mom, Lauren's
gonna be safe, okay?

53:59.965 --> 54:01.699
I need you to cherish your life

54:01.701 --> 54:04.968
with your husband and your son.

54:04.970 --> 54:06.269
What do you do to her?

54:06.271 --> 54:07.504
Do you drug her?

54:07.506 --> 54:09.272
Listen, mom, I gave
her something to sleep.

54:09.274 --> 54:10.574
Okay, I just gave her
something to sleep.

54:10.576 --> 54:13.343
I can't let her go, no!

54:13.345 --> 54:14.544
Listen to me.

54:14.546 --> 54:17.014
She is my best
friend in our time.

54:17.016 --> 54:21.218
She looks just like you,
your eyes and everything.

54:21.220 --> 54:22.419
Nico!

54:22.421 --> 54:23.821
All right, look, okay,
you gotta promise me

54:23.823 --> 54:24.988
you can't tell dad.

54:24.990 --> 54:27.224
He will not understand
if you tell him.

54:27.226 --> 54:28.926
This is too much,
this is not happening.

54:28.928 --> 54:30.460
This is a lot of information.

54:30.462 --> 54:33.130
I cannot even process
all what's happening now.

54:33.132 --> 54:35.866
Don't you feel it,
that he's your son?

54:35.868 --> 54:37.668
I know this is real.

54:37.670 --> 54:41.006
And I can feel that
you are my son, but.

54:42.474 --> 54:44.041
Yes, take care of her.

54:44.043 --> 54:44.877
I will.

54:45.945 --> 54:47.645
Nico, we have to go!

54:47.647 --> 54:49.012
I know, but babe,
just give me a minute.

54:49.014 --> 54:50.080
Please hurry.

54:50.082 --> 54:51.448
I will, I promise.

54:51.450 --> 54:53.118
Take her to the car.

54:55.520 --> 54:57.122
Take care of her.

55:04.596 --> 55:07.164
You grow up to be
a fine-looking man.

55:07.166 --> 55:09.599
And your wife,
she's so beautiful.

55:09.601 --> 55:11.268
Yeah, she is beautiful.

55:11.270 --> 55:14.104
I was wrong, I was wrong.

55:14.106 --> 55:16.640
Mom, I have to
tell you something.

55:16.642 --> 55:19.609
Where I'm from, you're
not in the future with me.

55:19.611 --> 55:21.478
But I'm here
now, I'm with you.

55:21.480 --> 55:23.146
I'll always be with you.

55:23.148 --> 55:24.514
I'm your mother!

55:24.516 --> 55:26.449
Listen, you really
were the best mother

55:26.451 --> 55:28.051
in the entire world.

55:28.053 --> 55:29.252
The best mother!

55:29.254 --> 55:31.590
You always say that to me.

55:37.129 --> 55:40.966
Guess you really were
always more beautiful.

55:43.669 --> 55:45.602
Mom, you can come with me.

55:45.604 --> 55:47.470
You can take care
of Lauren with me.

55:47.472 --> 55:50.473
Wait, who will be your
mother, here and now?

55:50.475 --> 55:51.641
Who's gonna take care of you,

55:51.643 --> 55:52.910
who's gonna be
there when you fall?

55:52.912 --> 55:54.077
I cannot be there.

55:54.079 --> 55:55.713
I can't leave him!

55:55.715 --> 55:59.451
I have to stay here with
you and your father.

56:02.855 --> 56:04.755
I heard that there
are women outside the city

56:04.757 --> 56:06.525
who are still fertile.

56:07.693 --> 56:09.192
They have a natural
immunity to the virus

56:09.194 --> 56:11.964
that those inside
the city don't.

56:23.042 --> 56:25.375
I have to go now.

56:26.378 --> 56:27.212
Mom?

56:35.454 --> 56:36.455
No, mom, no!

56:37.522 --> 56:38.621
No, mom!

56:38.623 --> 56:39.456
Are you hit?

56:39.458 --> 56:40.390
No, my mom, she's...

56:40.392 --> 56:41.658
Nico, you have to leave her!

56:41.660 --> 56:44.429
Stand up, you have
to run, leave her!

56:51.536 --> 56:53.136
I don't normally
do house calls,

56:53.138 --> 56:54.271
but who's first?

56:54.273 --> 56:55.973
She is, doc.

56:55.975 --> 56:57.107
How close?

56:57.109 --> 56:58.108
We have time.

56:58.110 --> 56:59.042
Doc, can you do this fast?

56:59.044 --> 57:02.179
I have no choice, let me see.

57:02.181 --> 57:04.714
All right, this will
numb the area, okay?

57:04.716 --> 57:06.917
Yeah, okay, that
sounds like a good idea.

57:06.919 --> 57:08.118
It'll be fine.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.152
Okay.

57:09.154 --> 57:10.453
Don't look, don't look, babe.

57:12.792 --> 57:15.961
All right, it's okay,
babe, it's okay.

57:17.562 --> 57:18.762
Okay, all right.

57:18.764 --> 57:20.130
It's okay, babe.

57:20.132 --> 57:22.766
All right, don't look,
don't look, don't look.

57:22.768 --> 57:24.367
You're fine, you're just fine.

57:24.369 --> 57:25.202
Well come on, come on!

57:25.204 --> 57:26.736
Let's go, let's go!

57:26.738 --> 57:28.605
Never seen it.

57:28.607 --> 57:30.340
It looks so ordinary.

57:30.342 --> 57:31.708
We don't have time
for sightseeing, doc.

57:31.710 --> 57:33.811
Yes, of course.

57:33.813 --> 57:34.744
All right.

57:34.746 --> 57:36.046
It worked!

57:36.048 --> 57:37.247
Wait, he's getting closer.

57:37.249 --> 57:38.715
Stitch up quick,
then, stitch up quick.

57:38.717 --> 57:40.483
Here's a bandage, okay.

57:40.485 --> 57:41.718
Your turn.

57:41.720 --> 57:42.920
Forget about it, doc,
just forget about it!

57:42.922 --> 57:43.586
If you flinch, I could
sever a blood vessel

57:43.588 --> 57:44.822
or a tendon!

57:44.824 --> 57:45.989
Look, I'm not gonna
flinch, just do it!

57:45.991 --> 57:47.590
Okay, hold him still.

57:47.592 --> 57:49.893
Come on, let's go!

57:50.963 --> 57:52.162
Do not move!

57:52.164 --> 57:53.732
Nico, don't move.

57:55.600 --> 57:57.267
Son of a

57:57.269 --> 57:58.101
Almost there.

57:58.103 --> 58:00.103
And he's almost here!

58:00.105 --> 58:01.071
Where is the chip?

58:01.073 --> 58:02.940
It's in really deep.

58:02.942 --> 58:05.342
Baby, go!

58:05.344 --> 58:06.343
Go check on Lauren in the car!

58:06.345 --> 58:07.544
What?

58:07.546 --> 58:09.146
Go in the car, check
on Lauren, do it!

58:09.148 --> 58:11.014
Son of a bitch!

58:11.016 --> 58:12.215
Almost there,
okay, almost there.

58:12.217 --> 58:13.783
Come on, doc, come on, doc!

58:13.785 --> 58:15.387
I got it, got it.

58:18.757 --> 58:19.756
I need to patch you up!

58:19.758 --> 58:20.592
No time!

58:50.990 --> 58:51.891
You okay?

58:52.791 --> 58:53.723
What?

58:53.725 --> 58:56.659
You were just having a dream.

58:56.661 --> 58:58.595
- What?
- A dream.

58:58.597 --> 58:59.431
Oh.

59:00.499 --> 59:02.032
I had a nightmare.

59:02.034 --> 59:04.134
What, about the kid?

59:04.136 --> 59:05.068
Sort of.

59:05.070 --> 59:06.970
What do you mean, sort of?

59:06.972 --> 59:08.071
Well it
started off that way,

59:08.073 --> 59:09.606
and then Thomas showed up,

59:09.608 --> 59:10.840
and the kid, he...

59:10.842 --> 59:12.775
And it ended the
way it always does.

59:12.777 --> 59:14.144
Yeah.

59:15.747 --> 59:16.880
Maybe he wants to hurt her.

59:16.882 --> 59:17.714
No, he doesn't.

59:17.716 --> 59:19.216
Yes he, does.

59:19.218 --> 59:20.417
- He doesn't, he doesn't.
- He wants to hurt her.

59:20.419 --> 59:21.618
And we gotta get
her somewhere safe.

59:21.620 --> 59:22.419
She is safe, it
was just a nightmare.

59:22.421 --> 59:23.820
We gotta protect her.

59:23.822 --> 59:24.654
We will.

59:24.656 --> 59:25.889
From Thomas.

59:25.891 --> 59:27.557
Thomas would never do
anything to hurt her.

59:27.559 --> 59:28.727
You know that.

59:30.996 --> 59:33.396
I'm afraid I don't, babe.

59:59.491 --> 01:00:00.325
Dammit.

01:00:06.932 --> 01:00:08.100
Still got you.

01:00:46.371 --> 01:00:47.206
Ow.

01:00:52.577 --> 01:00:54.311
Still alive?

01:00:54.313 --> 01:00:55.745
Yeah, still ticking.

01:00:55.747 --> 01:00:56.581
Hi!

01:00:57.716 --> 01:01:00.283
And who is this little
person at my door?

01:01:00.285 --> 01:01:01.784
What's your name, young lady?

01:01:01.786 --> 01:01:05.624
My name's Lauren, do you
have any apple juice, please?

01:01:07.026 --> 01:01:08.658
Come on in, we'll see
what we can do for you.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.993
Thank you!

01:01:09.995 --> 01:01:12.195
Come on, I'll take you.

01:01:12.197 --> 01:01:13.663
Ow.

01:01:13.665 --> 01:01:14.664
Still sore?

01:01:14.666 --> 01:01:16.266
Yeah, it's sore.

01:01:16.268 --> 01:01:18.001
Got you set up.

01:01:18.003 --> 01:01:18.837
Please.

01:01:37.989 --> 01:01:39.222
Well you managed

01:01:39.224 --> 01:01:40.157
not to wreck your
arm completely.

01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:42.425
Not that he didn't try.

01:01:42.427 --> 01:01:44.996
So who is your little friend?

01:01:46.231 --> 01:01:47.799
That's my sister.

01:01:49.168 --> 01:01:51.234
If you don't mind me
asking, where are you?

01:01:51.236 --> 01:01:54.437
My younger self,

01:01:54.439 --> 01:01:57.474
I'm at home with my father.

01:01:57.476 --> 01:01:59.544
What about your mother?

01:02:02.814 --> 01:02:04.547
Things are getting more
and more complicated.

01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:06.116
Yeah, you have no idea.

01:02:06.118 --> 01:02:08.587
What, what's the big secret?

01:02:09.954 --> 01:02:11.954
In the future,
where I come from,

01:02:11.956 --> 01:02:14.191
you saved my life.

01:02:14.193 --> 01:02:15.026
His, too.

01:02:16.628 --> 01:02:18.228
It's true.

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:19.662
How'd I do that?

01:02:19.664 --> 01:02:20.897
We reconnect.

01:02:20.899 --> 01:02:21.898
But, I shouldn't
tell you too much

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.766
about your own life.

01:02:23.768 --> 01:02:26.035
Well I'm glad to know
I'm still around, then.

01:02:26.037 --> 01:02:29.606
Anyway, I just
wanted to thank you.

01:02:29.608 --> 01:02:33.778
You are one of the bravest
people that I ever meet.

01:02:35.247 --> 01:02:36.179
It's the least I
could do for the man

01:02:36.181 --> 01:02:39.116
who saved my father's life.

01:02:39.118 --> 01:02:40.683
Dad?

01:02:40.685 --> 01:02:43.019
Oh, come here, son!

01:02:43.021 --> 01:02:44.354
We have some guests.

01:02:44.356 --> 01:02:45.788
You never told
me you had a son.

01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:48.425
I mean why else do I
have all these juice boxes?

01:02:48.427 --> 01:02:50.393
This is Travis, Travis
these are my friends.

01:02:50.395 --> 01:02:52.028
Hello, Travis.

01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:55.064
I'm Nicholai, you
can call me Nico.

01:02:55.066 --> 01:02:56.633
Go and play with Lauren, okay?

01:02:56.635 --> 01:02:57.900
Huh?

01:02:57.902 --> 01:02:59.169
She's staying
here for the day.

01:02:59.171 --> 01:03:00.004
Go ahead.

01:03:07.712 --> 01:03:10.913
His mother passed away two
years ago in an accident.

01:03:10.915 --> 01:03:13.416
He's all that I
have left of her.

01:03:13.418 --> 01:03:15.652
Thanks to you, we
have more time.

01:03:15.654 --> 01:03:16.921
Years, perhaps.

01:03:18.089 --> 01:03:20.759
And for that, I
am ever grateful.

01:03:22.527 --> 01:03:23.926
So he's doing well?

01:03:23.928 --> 01:03:25.094
He's healthy.

01:03:25.096 --> 01:03:27.664
And he has a positive
outlook on life.

01:03:27.666 --> 01:03:29.432
And knowing that
I have 30 years,

01:03:29.434 --> 01:03:31.434
he'll probably still outlive me.

01:03:31.436 --> 01:03:33.938
And poor Travis' step-brother.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.407
It's a good thing, though.

01:03:37.409 --> 01:03:39.409
Spending time with
family is important.

01:03:39.411 --> 01:03:41.010
Yes it is.

01:03:41.012 --> 01:03:43.515
And Travis is a full-time job.

01:03:45.184 --> 01:03:46.518
Something wrong?

01:03:48.086 --> 01:03:48.920
No.

01:03:50.155 --> 01:03:51.554
Sure, babe?

01:03:51.556 --> 01:03:52.557
Mhm, yeah.

01:03:54.693 --> 01:03:58.094
Thomas has one of these
trackers, too, as I recall.

01:03:58.096 --> 01:03:59.262
So where is he?

01:03:59.264 --> 01:04:03.500
He's, he's changed.

01:04:03.502 --> 01:04:04.801
We think that he's
planning something.

01:04:04.803 --> 01:04:06.102
Something terrible.

01:04:06.104 --> 01:04:08.171
Something like what?

01:04:09.808 --> 01:04:12.375
Can't tell you right now.

01:04:12.377 --> 01:04:14.711
Well whatever it is,
let me know if I can help.

01:04:14.713 --> 01:04:16.913
Actually, I do
need your help, doc.

01:04:16.915 --> 01:04:17.749
No.

01:04:19.818 --> 01:04:23.119
I need you to
watch her for me.

01:04:23.121 --> 01:04:24.122
Of course!

01:04:25.357 --> 01:04:27.959
See, something, something bad

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.828
happens to her in the future.

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:34.897
And we're trying
to prevent that.

01:04:34.899 --> 01:04:36.666
Is that what changes Thomas?

01:04:36.668 --> 01:04:37.834
Hm?

01:04:37.836 --> 01:04:40.272
He spoke of
Lauren in his time.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.375
Yeah, I guess.

01:04:45.577 --> 01:04:47.444
Look, I'll watch over her
like she's one of my own.

01:04:47.446 --> 01:04:48.645
Are you sure?

01:04:48.647 --> 01:04:49.579
We don't wanna
inconvenience you.

01:04:49.581 --> 01:04:50.813
Baby, it's just for now.

01:04:50.815 --> 01:04:52.014
I don't wanna pile
anything extra on him,

01:04:52.016 --> 01:04:53.216
we should just take her, and.

01:04:53.218 --> 01:04:54.551
Look, I understand.

01:04:54.553 --> 01:04:56.753
If you don't stop Thomas
from whatever it is,

01:04:56.755 --> 01:04:59.522
it'll only make matters worse.

01:04:59.524 --> 01:05:00.959
That's just it.

01:05:02.227 --> 01:05:03.562
Gotta get going.

01:05:11.202 --> 01:05:12.469
Is that Thomas?

01:05:12.471 --> 01:05:14.003
It's hard to say.

01:05:14.005 --> 01:05:14.937
There's two signals and they're

01:05:14.939 --> 01:05:15.738
getting closer to each other,

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.606
we have to go now.

01:05:16.608 --> 01:05:18.341
Wait, wait, Nico.

01:05:18.343 --> 01:05:19.809
Good luck, okay?

01:05:19.811 --> 01:05:21.143
And don't worry about
her, she's in good hands.

01:05:21.145 --> 01:05:22.945
Thanks, doc.

01:05:22.947 --> 01:05:24.215
Let's go, babe.

01:05:27.252 --> 01:05:28.285
Hey, what was that about?

01:05:28.287 --> 01:05:29.519
What?

01:05:29.521 --> 01:05:31.020
You looked like
you saw a ghost.

01:05:31.022 --> 01:05:32.722
He gave his life for you.

01:05:32.724 --> 01:05:34.391
I wasn't sure if I
should say anything.

01:05:34.393 --> 01:05:35.193
No, but.

01:05:36.261 --> 01:05:38.361
His son Travis.

01:05:38.363 --> 01:05:41.464
He doesn't turn
out quite so well.

01:05:41.466 --> 01:05:42.299
It's nothing.

01:05:42.301 --> 01:05:44.401
Hey, hey, you sure?

01:05:44.403 --> 01:05:45.234
Yeah.

01:05:45.236 --> 01:05:46.168
Just caught off guard.

01:05:47.372 --> 01:05:48.905
Let's go.

01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:49.908
All right.

01:05:56.781 --> 01:05:58.981
Wish I could go back and
destroy that machine.

01:05:58.983 --> 01:06:00.317
Babe, none of
this is your fault.

01:06:00.319 --> 01:06:01.584
You know that, right?

01:06:01.586 --> 01:06:02.519
I wouldn't have
built the machine,

01:06:02.521 --> 01:06:03.786
none of this would've happened.

01:06:03.788 --> 01:06:05.021
You gave people
a fighting chance,

01:06:05.023 --> 01:06:06.456
it's something that
they never had before.

01:06:06.458 --> 01:06:08.257
They're gonna keep sending
people back after us.

01:06:08.259 --> 01:06:09.992
Don't you get it?

01:06:09.994 --> 01:06:11.160
What are you saying?

01:06:11.162 --> 01:06:12.094
So what I'm
saying is we need to

01:06:12.096 --> 01:06:14.664
get home now, more than ever.

01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:16.466
Gotta rebuild the machine.

01:06:16.468 --> 01:06:18.570
Then you'll rebuild it.

01:06:21.373 --> 01:06:24.641
I can't do it without Thomas.

01:06:24.643 --> 01:06:26.476
Then we'll convince Thomas.

01:06:26.478 --> 01:06:30.112
After we stop him
from killing everyone.

01:06:30.114 --> 01:06:31.115
All right.

01:06:32.617 --> 01:06:34.218
Wait, wait, stop.

01:06:37.255 --> 01:06:38.755
We can't, we can't, no, babe!

01:06:41.526 --> 01:06:43.360
Okay, okay, everything's
gonna be okay.

01:06:43.362 --> 01:06:45.027
Nico, call an ambulance!

01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:46.262
My baby!

01:06:46.264 --> 01:06:47.163
What's your name,
what's your name?

01:06:47.165 --> 01:06:48.598
- Carmen.
- Carmen, okay.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.066
I need you to breathe,
Carmen, okay, stay with me.

01:06:50.068 --> 01:06:51.601
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:06:51.603 --> 01:06:54.036
You're not gonna be
alone, just, relax, okay?

01:06:54.038 --> 01:06:56.573
Okay, the ambulance is coming.

01:06:56.575 --> 01:06:58.641
Babe, you know we can't stay.

01:06:58.643 --> 01:07:00.377
Nico, I'm not
leaving her, I can't.

01:07:00.379 --> 01:07:01.310
You know why.

01:07:01.312 --> 01:07:02.345
I know, but we have to go.

01:07:02.347 --> 01:07:03.212
No, you need to go.

01:07:03.214 --> 01:07:04.614
Just go without me.

01:07:04.616 --> 01:07:06.349
I'll be fine, Thomas.

01:07:06.351 --> 01:07:07.884
I'll be right behind you.

01:07:07.886 --> 01:07:09.552
I promise.

01:07:09.554 --> 01:07:11.354
I'm meant to be here.

01:07:11.356 --> 01:07:13.558
- Okay, okay.
- I love you.

01:07:15.994 --> 01:07:18.227
Okay, okay, Carmen, I
need you to breathe, okay?

01:07:18.229 --> 01:07:19.228
What's your baby's name?

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:20.029
- Cadence.
- Cadence,

01:07:20.031 --> 01:07:21.931
baby Cadence, right?

01:07:21.933 --> 01:07:23.566
You know how lucky you are?

01:07:23.568 --> 01:07:26.969
Do, do you have any
children of your own?

01:07:26.971 --> 01:07:28.337
Not yet.

01:07:28.339 --> 01:07:29.872
One day.

01:07:29.874 --> 01:07:30.709
One day.

01:07:31.976 --> 01:07:32.811
One day.

01:07:42.353 --> 01:07:43.520
Hey, how you doing?

01:07:43.522 --> 01:07:45.054
Good, and you?

01:07:45.056 --> 01:07:46.623
Good, good, you going to
the Biocorp ball tonight?

01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:47.557
Yeah, of course.

01:07:47.559 --> 01:07:48.691
You got an invite?

01:07:48.693 --> 01:07:49.892
I got it right here.

01:07:49.894 --> 01:07:52.361
Okay, so I need
that and your clothes.

01:07:52.363 --> 01:07:55.532
Good one, Arnie.

01:07:55.534 --> 01:07:56.799
Get out of the car.

01:07:56.801 --> 01:07:58.369
Give me the invite.

01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:00.104
Come on.

01:08:02.807 --> 01:08:04.541
Take your jacket off.

01:08:04.543 --> 01:08:05.842
You work for Biocorp?

01:08:05.844 --> 01:08:06.643
Yeah.

01:08:06.645 --> 01:08:08.580
You really shouldn't.

01:08:10.381 --> 01:08:12.715
Come on, come on, come on.

01:08:12.717 --> 01:08:14.784
We didn't
find any downside.

01:08:14.786 --> 01:08:16.653
From all the research
that we've done, sir,

01:08:16.654 --> 01:08:19.589
we have had absolutely
nothing going wrong,

01:08:19.591 --> 01:08:22.191
but what I'm talking about
is we need to make extra sure

01:08:22.193 --> 01:08:23.460
before we go in front of the FDA

01:08:23.462 --> 01:08:24.627
or any other approval board...

01:08:24.629 --> 01:08:27.464
Senator, so
sorry to interrupt.

01:08:27.466 --> 01:08:29.331
I just wanted to
shake your hand.

01:08:29.332 --> 01:08:30.166
Hello.

01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:31.200
Hello.

01:08:31.202 --> 01:08:32.401
And Robert.

01:08:32.403 --> 01:08:34.537
I didn't expect to
see you again so soon.

01:08:34.538 --> 01:08:37.339
What a bonus that you're here.

01:08:37.341 --> 01:08:39.108
Yeah, it's good
to see you, too.

01:08:39.109 --> 01:08:40.612
Enjoy the party.

01:09:10.609 --> 01:09:14.779
There's a possible intruder
in the maintenance area.

01:09:53.084 --> 01:09:55.618
Sir, this area is off limits!

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:56.853
I'm sorry?

01:09:56.855 --> 01:09:58.855
I said sir, this
area is off limits.

01:09:58.857 --> 01:10:00.557
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:10:00.559 --> 01:10:01.991
I'm not from here.

01:10:01.993 --> 01:10:04.527
I was just looking for a
place for a cheeky cigarette.

01:10:04.529 --> 01:10:05.662
Sir, you're gonna
have to come with me.

01:10:05.664 --> 01:10:07.732
Yes, of course, please.

01:10:16.908 --> 01:10:19.275
Sir, this area is off limits.

01:10:19.277 --> 01:10:21.077
Oh, yes, I'm sorry, gentlemen,

01:10:21.079 --> 01:10:22.612
I was looking for the bathroom.

01:10:22.614 --> 01:10:24.947
It's just off the main
entrance, it's this way.

01:10:24.949 --> 01:10:26.215
It is?

01:10:26.217 --> 01:10:27.850
Why don't we just
go straight there?

01:10:27.852 --> 01:10:28.785
We'll escort you.

01:10:28.787 --> 01:10:30.722
Please, lead the way.

01:10:32.924 --> 01:10:36.593
Can I see your
invitation, please?

01:10:36.595 --> 01:10:37.594
Yes, of course.

01:10:37.596 --> 01:10:39.430
I put it right here.

01:10:50.241 --> 01:10:52.642
Can I help you, sir?

01:10:52.644 --> 01:10:53.643
Hi.

01:10:53.645 --> 01:10:55.845
I'm here for the Biocorp event.

01:10:55.847 --> 01:10:58.280
Sir, the main entrance
is around to the front.

01:10:58.282 --> 01:11:00.316
Oh, I'm with a special
group within the company

01:11:00.318 --> 01:11:03.185
that's here to put on a
special surprise tonight.

01:11:03.187 --> 01:11:06.455
Well do you have a
regular invitation, sir?

01:11:06.457 --> 01:11:07.657
No.

01:11:07.659 --> 01:11:09.926
Then I'm afraid I
can't let you in at all.

01:11:09.928 --> 01:11:11.728
Well I'm afraid
that I outrank you

01:11:11.730 --> 01:11:13.529
in every conceivable way.

01:11:13.531 --> 01:11:15.031
And I am coming in.

01:11:15.033 --> 01:11:18.367
Sir, please leave the
premises immediately.

01:11:18.369 --> 01:11:19.769
Or what?

01:11:19.771 --> 01:11:23.239
Or I'll have you
arrested for trespassing.

01:11:23.241 --> 01:11:26.609
Well I guess you
better arrest me.

01:11:26.611 --> 01:11:28.110
Give me one big
push, all right?

01:11:31.315 --> 01:11:33.482
I can't do it, I can't do it!

01:11:33.484 --> 01:11:34.751
You're doing good, okay?

01:11:34.753 --> 01:11:35.818
Look at me, you're
doing a great job.

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.253
- I can't!
- One big push, okay?

01:11:39.057 --> 01:11:40.089
It's there, I see it.

01:11:40.091 --> 01:11:41.858
Come on, there you go.

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:43.325
Nice and big one,
come on, let's go.

01:11:45.163 --> 01:11:47.229
There, yeah, there
you go, there you go.

01:11:47.231 --> 01:11:49.031
There you go, there
you go, that's it.

01:11:49.033 --> 01:11:50.232
- Congratulations.
- Baby girl!

01:11:50.234 --> 01:11:53.235
- Congratulations!
- Beautiful baby girl.

01:11:53.237 --> 01:11:54.739
She's beautiful.

01:11:57.575 --> 01:11:58.910
She's beautiful.

01:12:00.078 --> 01:12:03.748
Trust me, I got the
better end of this deal.

01:12:04.949 --> 01:12:06.783
I have to go, good luck, okay?

01:12:06.785 --> 01:12:07.817
Thank you so much.

01:12:07.819 --> 01:12:08.820
Thank you.

01:12:17.696 --> 01:12:18.697
Excuse me.

01:12:20.598 --> 01:12:21.432
Excuse me.

01:12:22.633 --> 01:12:23.467
Excuse me.

01:13:16.788 --> 01:13:18.056
I missed you.

01:13:20.224 --> 01:13:22.493
What are you doing, baby?

01:13:23.527 --> 01:13:25.463
I did what I have to.

01:13:27.498 --> 01:13:29.667
I came here to save you.

01:13:31.469 --> 01:13:32.303
No.

01:13:33.537 --> 01:13:34.804
No.

01:13:34.806 --> 01:13:36.605
I'm trying to save you.

01:13:36.607 --> 01:13:37.874
No.

01:13:37.876 --> 01:13:39.443
This isn't the way.

01:13:41.512 --> 01:13:43.279
Let me do this.

01:13:43.281 --> 01:13:45.049
Otherwise I lose you.

01:13:47.085 --> 01:13:48.586
Do you trust me?

01:13:50.321 --> 01:13:51.155
Yeah.

01:13:53.557 --> 01:13:54.959
Do you love me?

01:13:58.662 --> 01:14:00.296
Yeah.

01:14:00.298 --> 01:14:01.199
I love you.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.435
I've always loved you.

01:14:14.012 --> 01:14:15.679
Trust me, my love.

01:14:17.949 --> 01:14:20.218
We'll see each other again.

01:14:53.317 --> 01:14:54.152
Do not.

01:14:55.353 --> 01:14:56.687
We warned you.

01:15:03.561 --> 01:15:06.028
Ladies and gentlemen, we
have a special guest tonight.

01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:07.763
It's my pleasure to
introduce to you,

01:15:07.765 --> 01:15:09.598
Senator Jim Williams.

01:15:15.974 --> 01:15:17.706
Thank you.

01:15:17.708 --> 01:15:19.608
Thank you all.

01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:23.880
We're uh, not quite sure
where Bob Tinker is right now,

01:15:23.882 --> 01:15:26.415
but if it's all right with
you, I'll do the honors.

01:15:27.919 --> 01:15:31.020
You have had a wonderful
and successful year

01:15:31.022 --> 01:15:32.588
here at Biocorp.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:39.962
Your hard work has
made the company

01:15:39.964 --> 01:15:43.866
as powerful and
proficient as it is today.

01:15:46.337 --> 01:15:49.805
But now, I have had
the honor of being

01:15:49.807 --> 01:15:52.274
one of the prime architects

01:15:52.276 --> 01:15:54.376
in the establishment

01:15:54.378 --> 01:15:57.579
of a new government
contract with Biocorp.

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.355
The goal is the new Biocorp

01:16:08.359 --> 01:16:11.793
will rid the entire
world of crime

01:16:11.795 --> 01:16:14.396
within the next 10 years.

01:16:33.784 --> 01:16:35.717
Thomas, where are you?

01:16:35.719 --> 01:16:38.287
Thomas, Thomas, Thomas!

01:16:38.289 --> 01:16:40.189
Oh Thomas, thank god, it's you.

01:16:40.191 --> 01:16:41.323
What are you doing?

01:16:41.325 --> 01:16:43.025
What am I doing?

01:16:43.027 --> 01:16:46.328
We're here to stop you from
doing something horrible.

01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:47.329
How do you know about that?

01:16:47.331 --> 01:16:48.597
Thomas!

01:16:48.599 --> 01:16:49.831
We're not idiots,
we figured it out!

01:16:49.833 --> 01:16:50.766
You probably figured out

01:16:50.768 --> 01:16:52.134
you can't stop it either, Nico!

01:16:52.136 --> 01:16:54.070
Nothing can stop it now.

01:16:54.072 --> 01:16:55.271
In the name of god, Nico,

01:16:55.273 --> 01:16:56.905
why would you
wanna stop it, huh?

01:16:56.907 --> 01:16:58.140
Look at these people!

01:16:58.142 --> 01:16:59.641
They're murderers,
mass murderers,

01:16:59.643 --> 01:17:01.210
every single one of them!

01:17:01.212 --> 01:17:02.844
No, no, they're innocent.

01:17:02.846 --> 01:17:04.346
Lauren was innocent!

01:17:04.348 --> 01:17:05.314
Look, Lauren wouldn't
want you to be doing this!

01:17:05.316 --> 01:17:06.548
Yes she would, Nico!

01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:07.916
She'd want me to kill a
few to save a billion,

01:17:07.918 --> 01:17:09.151
you know she would!

01:17:09.153 --> 01:17:10.352
Do you want that
on your conscience?

01:17:10.354 --> 01:17:11.353
Do you?

01:17:11.355 --> 01:17:12.588
It's bigger than us.

01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:14.490
I know it's bigger
than me and you.

01:17:14.492 --> 01:17:17.226
Okay, so just, just go.

01:17:17.228 --> 01:17:18.794
Let me do this, go!

01:17:18.796 --> 01:17:19.996
Go!

01:17:19.998 --> 01:17:22.064
And what are
you gonna do, huh?

01:17:22.066 --> 01:17:23.265
It's a bomb, isn't it.

01:17:23.267 --> 01:17:24.333
It doesn't matter what it is!

01:17:24.335 --> 01:17:25.167
It's a bomb, isn't it!

01:17:25.169 --> 01:17:26.002
Yes!

01:17:26.004 --> 01:17:27.103
Oh my god.

01:17:27.105 --> 01:17:28.971
Thomas, I've got Lauren.

01:17:28.973 --> 01:17:30.706
- No, stop, stop.
- We can fix this!

01:17:30.708 --> 01:17:32.874
Thomas look at me, look at me!

01:17:32.876 --> 01:17:34.276
She's with a doctor,
we can fix this!

01:17:34.278 --> 01:17:36.112
No, as a baby, right?

01:17:36.114 --> 01:17:37.413
You went and got her as a baby!

01:17:37.415 --> 01:17:38.947
Nico, it's not the same!

01:17:38.949 --> 01:17:40.582
Nothing is gonna change my mind.

01:17:40.584 --> 01:17:42.918
- Please come.
- No.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.253
You gotta go.

01:17:44.255 --> 01:17:45.856
For me, please, go.

01:17:47.225 --> 01:17:48.690
Okay, all right.

01:17:48.692 --> 01:17:51.293
If you kill these people,
then you kill me, too.

01:17:51.295 --> 01:17:52.828
I'm not leaving without you.

01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:54.763
Then I'm gonna kill
Jenny, too, right?

01:17:54.765 --> 01:17:56.898
She's in the building
somewhere, Nico, right?

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.167
She's here, right?

01:17:58.169 --> 01:17:59.401
Somewhere?

01:17:59.403 --> 01:18:01.270
You're gonna take that
risk with her life?

01:18:01.272 --> 01:18:03.172
Don't waste your
time following me.

01:18:03.174 --> 01:18:04.640
You'll never find
that bomb, mate.

01:18:04.642 --> 01:18:05.941
You haven't got the time.

01:18:05.943 --> 01:18:06.975
Thomas!

01:18:06.977 --> 01:18:08.544
Thomas!

01:18:15.553 --> 01:18:17.353
Oh my god, what do I do?

01:18:17.355 --> 01:18:18.720
- Was that Thomas?
- Yes, that was Thomas.

01:18:18.722 --> 01:18:20.189
Oh my god, he has
a bomb in here.

01:18:20.191 --> 01:18:21.323
We need to find it!

01:18:21.325 --> 01:18:22.691
It could be anywhere!

01:18:22.693 --> 01:18:24.028
The danger, too.

01:18:25.063 --> 01:18:27.063
What was it, honey?

01:18:27.065 --> 01:18:27.996
Baby girl.

01:18:27.998 --> 01:18:29.231
- It was?
- She's okay.

01:18:29.233 --> 01:18:30.732
Okay, that's good,
that's real good.

01:18:30.734 --> 01:18:32.201
Okay, we need to
get everyone out.

01:18:32.203 --> 01:18:33.135
Okay.

01:18:33.137 --> 01:18:35.439
Everyone, everyone listen up!

01:18:36.374 --> 01:18:37.939
- Listen to me!
- Listen!

01:18:37.941 --> 01:18:39.508
There's a bomb
in the building!

01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:40.909
We have to leave!

01:18:40.911 --> 01:18:42.844
Everyone listen to me!

01:18:42.846 --> 01:18:44.115
There's a bomb!

01:18:48.852 --> 01:18:50.088
Get outta here!

01:18:51.955 --> 01:18:53.289
Get outta here!

01:18:53.291 --> 01:18:55.057
There's a bomb!

01:18:55.059 --> 01:18:56.892
There's a bomb, get out!

01:18:56.894 --> 01:18:58.796
Come on, we gotta go!

01:19:16.347 --> 01:19:19.183
Move, move, move!

01:19:57.988 --> 01:19:59.321
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Police, don't move!

01:19:59.323 --> 01:20:01.925
Whoa, whoa, okay, we're okay.

01:20:17.908 --> 01:20:19.241
Nico!

01:20:19.243 --> 01:20:20.077
Thomas!

01:20:20.944 --> 01:20:22.678
What have you done?

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.612
Are you crazy?

01:20:23.614 --> 01:20:24.713
What have you done!

01:20:24.715 --> 01:20:26.114
We had to stop you.

01:20:26.116 --> 01:20:27.349
Stop me?

01:20:27.351 --> 01:20:29.318
You didn't stop me,
you ruined everything!

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.652
- Thomas!
- Nico!

01:20:30.654 --> 01:20:32.120
There's still time,
Nico, to fix this.

01:20:32.122 --> 01:20:33.322
Tell me what you
did with the bomb.

01:20:33.324 --> 01:20:34.590
You let her go!

01:20:34.592 --> 01:20:35.724
I swear to god, I'm
gonna kill you, man!

01:20:35.726 --> 01:20:37.259
You killed everything
you love, Nico.

01:20:37.261 --> 01:20:38.894
You killed me, you killed
Jenny, you killed Lauren,

01:20:38.896 --> 01:20:41.330
you killed every single
person we ever loved!

01:20:41.332 --> 01:20:42.431
And for what?

01:20:42.433 --> 01:20:44.200
For these people?

01:20:44.202 --> 01:20:47.669
Look, look, look, I'll
figure something out,

01:20:47.671 --> 01:20:49.037
- just let her go.
- No!

01:20:49.039 --> 01:20:51.440
Nico, this is kill or be killed.

01:20:51.442 --> 01:20:52.474
Time to man up!

01:20:52.476 --> 01:20:53.877
Give me the bomb!

01:21:01.919 --> 01:21:03.185
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait,

01:21:03.187 --> 01:21:04.152
there's a guy with
a gun in there,

01:21:04.154 --> 01:21:05.454
he's just shot two officers.

01:21:05.456 --> 01:21:08.892
He's going crazy, he's
shootin' everybody!

01:21:36.086 --> 01:21:37.619
Sir, something's wrong.

01:21:37.621 --> 01:21:38.454
What do you mean?

01:21:38.456 --> 01:21:39.621
What's wrong?

01:21:39.623 --> 01:21:41.122
His brain activity
is all wrong.

01:21:41.124 --> 01:21:42.057
What do you mean, wrong?

01:21:42.059 --> 01:21:43.292
His heart rate's slowing too!

01:21:43.294 --> 01:21:46.895
Can't anyone here
do anything right?

01:21:46.897 --> 01:21:49.265
Baby,
babe, hang in there!

01:21:51.235 --> 01:21:53.837
No, no, no, no!

01:21:55.072 --> 01:21:56.472
You should go.

01:21:56.474 --> 01:21:57.973
Go!

01:21:57.975 --> 01:21:59.875
You know they're gonna send
more people back, Thomas.

01:21:59.877 --> 01:22:01.677
You know he's not the end!

01:22:01.679 --> 01:22:02.744
I need your help.

01:22:02.746 --> 01:22:03.579
To do what?

01:22:03.581 --> 01:22:04.546
To fix it?

01:22:04.548 --> 01:22:06.282
I was trying to fix it, Nico!

01:22:06.284 --> 01:22:07.483
That's what I was doing!

01:22:07.485 --> 01:22:08.817
Not that way.

01:22:08.819 --> 01:22:10.153
Not in that way!

01:22:11.188 --> 01:22:13.021
We can rebuild the machine.

01:22:13.023 --> 01:22:14.690
Okay, I just need your help!

01:22:14.692 --> 01:22:16.224
I need your help, I need you.

01:22:16.226 --> 01:22:18.627
You can find the cause of
the virus before it spreads!

01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:20.862
The cause of the
virus was in that room,

01:22:20.864 --> 01:22:22.698
and you let them get away!

01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:24.065
We, we can...

01:22:24.067 --> 01:22:24.900
We can what?

01:22:24.902 --> 01:22:26.167
We can wait?

01:22:26.169 --> 01:22:29.070
For Biocorp to send back
another guy to kill us?

01:22:29.072 --> 01:22:31.907
Or send back a guy to kill our
families before we're born!

01:22:31.909 --> 01:22:33.911
What are we waiting for?

01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:39.047
We're waiting for nothing, Nico.

01:22:39.049 --> 01:22:40.782
And don't you worry.

01:22:40.784 --> 01:22:42.684
I'm gonna fix it, my friend.

01:22:42.686 --> 01:22:44.953
And I'm gonna ask you
for just one more thing.

01:22:44.955 --> 01:22:48.223
And then we never have
to see each other.

01:22:48.225 --> 01:22:49.393
When I fix it,

01:22:51.228 --> 01:22:52.896
don't get in my way.

01:22:53.797 --> 01:22:56.199
There's the one little thing.

01:23:00.137 --> 01:23:02.003
- No, no, no, no!
- We have to stop him, Nico!

01:23:02.005 --> 01:23:04.940
- No, we can't!
- Won't get another chance!

01:23:04.942 --> 01:23:07.275
Let him go.

01:23:13.351 --> 01:23:16.086
His brain activity
is inactive.

01:23:18.956 --> 01:23:20.791
His heart rate's flat.

01:23:22.259 --> 01:23:26.196
Is there any chance that
he is still alive in 2017?

01:23:29.633 --> 01:23:30.899
No, sir.

01:23:30.901 --> 01:23:32.470
He's uh, he's dead.

01:23:39.076 --> 01:23:41.009
Prepare the clean
sweep protocol.

01:23:41.011 --> 01:23:42.344
Do we have the authorization?

01:23:42.346 --> 01:23:43.845
Prep the machines!

01:23:43.847 --> 01:23:45.747
Yes, sir.

01:23:45.749 --> 01:23:49.751
This whole thing has
spun out of control!

01:23:49.753 --> 01:23:51.353
How many can we send in?

01:23:51.355 --> 01:23:52.988
The Speaker says
that by hour's end,

01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:54.356
they will have completed
enough chambers

01:23:54.358 --> 01:23:56.093
to send 50 at a time.

01:23:59.497 --> 01:24:00.328
50?

01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:01.597
Yes, Mr. President.

01:24:01.599 --> 01:24:04.533
All right, tell him
to send four waves,

01:24:04.535 --> 01:24:06.234
as soon as possible.

01:24:06.236 --> 01:24:07.237
Four, sir?

01:24:08.472 --> 01:24:10.238
Are you aware of the
concern many have?

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:13.409
I'm very well
aware of the dangers.

01:24:13.411 --> 01:24:16.580
I may be causing our
own annihilation.

01:24:18.048 --> 01:24:21.785
But to do nothing, would
mean the same thing.

01:24:39.136 --> 01:24:40.802
How do you feel?

01:24:40.804 --> 01:24:41.972
Still alive.

01:24:42.873 --> 01:24:43.974
Thankfully.

01:24:46.977 --> 01:24:47.978
So now what?

01:24:50.714 --> 01:24:53.749
Build a time machine,
head back home.

01:24:53.751 --> 01:24:56.585
I still think we
need to stop him.

01:24:56.587 --> 01:24:57.919
He's way beyond
our reach, babe.

01:24:57.921 --> 01:24:59.187
He'll kill too many people

01:24:59.189 --> 01:25:03.126
before we can assemble a
machine or fix anything.

01:25:04.094 --> 01:25:06.196
We need to stop him, Nico.

01:25:08.699 --> 01:25:10.766
- Dammit!
- What is it?

01:25:12.903 --> 01:25:13.904
Oh my god.

01:25:14.838 --> 01:25:17.508
Are there any new waves today?

01:25:18.375 --> 01:25:19.407
Are they close?

01:25:19.409 --> 01:25:20.676
No, thank god.

01:25:20.678 --> 01:25:23.078
Wait, why is it doing
this, is it broken?

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.081
I hope so.

01:25:25.683 --> 01:25:28.049
Because if it isn't,

01:25:28.051 --> 01:25:31.455
they just sent a
shitload of people back.

01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:52.941
Think I'm going
to like it here.
