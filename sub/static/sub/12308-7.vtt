00:02.105 --> 00:04.893
Are you ready?
They're preparing to dial the Gate.

00:05.180 --> 00:06.807
Yeah, almost finished.

00:08.962 --> 00:10.101
I know,

00:10.464 --> 00:13.247
I'm terrible at packing.
I never know how much to bring.

00:13.367 --> 00:14.975
<i>We are only going overnight.</i>

00:15.137 --> 00:16.353
I'm sure you have enough.

00:16.482 --> 00:18.697
Well, you'd think so, but...

00:20.396 --> 00:22.169
You seem nervous.

00:22.342 --> 00:24.492
Oh, no, I'm fine.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.335
Well, maybe a little.

00:27.849 --> 00:30.793
Going off-world
is still kind of new to me.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.648
Whole other galaxy
and meeting new civilizations...

00:35.222 --> 00:37.873
My people are very welcoming
and they're eager to meet you.

00:38.024 --> 00:39.790
Well, I'm eager to meet them, too,

00:40.117 --> 00:42.246
learn about their culture
and their history.

00:42.366 --> 00:44.853
A gesture for which
they will be most grateful.

00:45.183 --> 00:46.287
It's just...

00:47.021 --> 00:49.719
I know they were very fond of Carson.

00:50.347 --> 00:52.821
I only hope to make
half the impression he did.

00:53.548 --> 00:54.803
What are those?

00:54.997 --> 00:56.266
Oh, lollipops.

00:57.025 --> 00:58.101
For the kids.

00:58.393 --> 01:00.202
Makes the check-ups go easier.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.264
You will make a wonderful impression.

01:09.728 --> 01:11.024
Look at you.

01:11.144 --> 01:12.325
Got a date?

01:12.821 --> 01:13.823
Please.

01:14.224 --> 01:16.238
You will contact us if you need us?

01:16.358 --> 01:18.373
Oh, we'll be fine. You kids have fun.

01:18.609 --> 01:20.225
You're gonna love the Athosians.

01:20.411 --> 01:22.553
I'm going to experience
my first tandul feast.

01:22.673 --> 01:23.919
<i>Oh, those are good, but</i>

01:24.081 --> 01:25.718
watch out for the...

01:26.331 --> 01:28.470
What do you call it?
- Roos wine.

01:28.620 --> 01:29.426
<i>Roos wine.</i>

01:29.644 --> 01:31.171
Tasty stuff, but a hell of a kick.

01:31.291 --> 01:32.971
We really should be going.

01:33.592 --> 01:34.749
Have fun, kids.

01:46.056 --> 01:48.193
The settlement is through the woods.
- Lead the way.

01:48.357 --> 01:50.968
It is some distance.
Let me help you with those.

01:51.105 --> 01:52.384
Oh no, no, it's okay.

01:52.535 --> 01:55.160
I'm the idiot who over-packed.
I should be the idiot carrying them.

01:57.187 --> 01:58.954
So Sheppard was right, huh?

01:59.671 --> 02:01.475
About that hot date tonight?

02:03.787 --> 02:05.625
<i>I didn't think it would be this far.</i>

02:13.003 --> 02:14.554
Is it always this quiet?

02:15.464 --> 02:16.678
Something is wrong.

02:22.104 --> 02:23.201
Hello?

02:28.557 --> 02:29.679
Hello!

02:31.827 --> 02:33.097
Is anybody here?

02:33.302 --> 02:34.546
Where is everyone?

02:35.502 --> 02:36.760
I do not know,

02:37.663 --> 02:39.913
but they did not leave
of their own accord.

02:40.322 --> 02:42.212
Are you saying they were attacked?

02:44.925 --> 02:46.211
Or culled.

03:55.921 --> 03:58.360
I thought the Wraith
didn't know about this planet.

04:00.450 --> 04:02.651
That was my understanding as well.

04:04.032 --> 04:05.876
Well then, how could they just...

04:07.000 --> 04:08.255
What is it?

04:22.605 --> 04:23.807
You know them?

04:26.484 --> 04:27.867
We must leave.

04:38.766 --> 04:39.918
Over here.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.436
The weapons cache is too far.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.808
What?
- Better to make a run for the gate.

04:50.653 --> 04:52.862
What are you...
What are you looking for?

04:54.770 --> 04:56.055
Did you bring a weapon?

04:56.178 --> 04:59.469
No, it's just medical supplies.
Don't you have a weapon?

05:01.524 --> 05:02.597
<i>Just a knife.</i>

05:02.990 --> 05:06.010
I was coming to visit my people.
I did not believe I would need a gun.

05:06.983 --> 05:09.265
Who are those men?
- Bola Kai.

05:09.385 --> 05:11.609
<i>You know them?</i>
- I know of them.

05:11.929 --> 05:14.626
The markings on their faces
are distinctive to their tribe,

05:14.746 --> 05:16.625
but I have never
crossed paths with them...

05:16.748 --> 05:17.779
Until now.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.477
Are they dangerous?

05:23.945 --> 05:25.370
Beyond dangerous.

05:26.756 --> 05:27.792
Let's go.

05:58.343 --> 05:59.517
Are you all right?

05:59.855 --> 06:01.206
I twisted my ankle.

06:02.583 --> 06:03.783
We have to keep moving.

06:03.903 --> 06:05.410
Just hang on a sec.

06:05.724 --> 06:06.984
Is it broken?

06:08.164 --> 06:09.414
No, I don't think so.

06:09.977 --> 06:11.754
It's probably just sprained.

06:14.829 --> 06:16.851
<i>Leave the bag. It's too heavy.</i>

06:38.964 --> 06:40.278
Oh, God, what do we do?

06:41.277 --> 06:43.668
It is too risky to return
to the weapons cache.

06:43.812 --> 06:45.213
What weapons cache?

06:45.404 --> 06:47.646
We gave my people guns

06:47.796 --> 06:50.543
to protect themselves
in the event they were raided.

06:50.979 --> 06:53.061
What makes you think
that the guns would still there?

06:53.181 --> 06:55.395
Wouldn't that be the first thing
those guys would steal?

06:55.518 --> 06:57.795
If the Bola Kai stole them,
they would be using them.

06:59.272 --> 07:00.964
<i>But the weapons cache is too far,</i>

07:01.126 --> 07:02.549
especially in your condition,

07:02.711 --> 07:05.136
<i>and we have no idea how many
more Bola Kai are out there.</i>

07:10.938 --> 07:13.478
Our best option is to take out
these guards by ourselves.

07:13.716 --> 07:15.448
Take them out?
What are you talking about?

07:15.593 --> 07:17.269
How are we going to do that?

07:17.558 --> 07:18.691
I don't know yet.

07:19.918 --> 07:20.860
Hey, listen,

07:21.020 --> 07:24.237
I am not like you.
I don't know anything about fighting.

07:26.727 --> 07:27.825
Just do what I say.

07:27.957 --> 07:29.989
I want to, believe me, but I...

07:30.441 --> 07:31.583
I don't think I can.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.206
You must think otherwise.

07:33.366 --> 07:35.342
What we first need to do is create a...

08:10.099 --> 08:11.411
They're gone.

08:14.349 --> 08:15.373
Are you all right?

08:16.071 --> 08:17.457
I'm sorry.

08:17.962 --> 08:20.369
I know this is something
for which you are unprepared.

08:20.538 --> 08:22.718
I should be prepared, I know.

08:23.210 --> 08:27.267
Unfortunately, I'm afraid things may
get worse before they get better.

08:27.814 --> 08:30.847
Those guards will alert
the others to our situation,

08:31.631 --> 08:33.640
<i>and they will hunt us.</i>

08:34.652 --> 08:37.878
The longer we avoid capture,
the better our chances.

08:38.630 --> 08:40.772
They will continue
to guard the Gate, yes,

08:41.226 --> 08:43.332
<i>but in time,
Atlantis will realize we are late,</i>

08:43.455 --> 08:45.218
<i>and they will send a rescue team.</i>

08:45.431 --> 08:47.779
But we're not due back till tomorrow.

08:48.493 --> 08:52.410
It is therefore critical that
we elude capture until then.

08:52.994 --> 08:54.958
<i>What do you need to help your injury?</i>

08:55.430 --> 08:57.636
Well, I should probably wrap it,

08:57.759 --> 09:00.333
but the ace bandages
are in the medical kit.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.651
The kit is on the way
to the weapons cache.

09:06.801 --> 09:08.593
Hopefully, it'll still be where we...

09:12.296 --> 09:13.680
What is that?

09:14.455 --> 09:16.057
They are summoning the others,

09:16.491 --> 09:17.927
<i>gathering them.</i>

09:19.563 --> 09:21.080
The hunt is beginning.

09:35.268 --> 09:36.596
Oh, thank God.

09:37.334 --> 09:38.955
You must move quickly.
- I will.

09:43.403 --> 09:44.715
Ibuprofen.

09:45.617 --> 09:47.735
Helps with the pain and swelling.
- Yes.

09:48.897 --> 09:50.920
Dr. Mckay uses them frequently,

09:51.056 --> 09:52.762
along with antihistamines, antacids,

09:52.898 --> 09:54.331
motion-sickness pills...

09:54.473 --> 09:57.515
You forgot the prescription I just
wrote him for restless leg syndrome.

09:59.691 --> 10:00.977
<i>I've always been a wimp.</i>

10:01.467 --> 10:03.340
I've got a low threshold for pain.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.281
People often underestimate
the level of discomfort

10:06.401 --> 10:08.164
they are capable of enduring.

10:09.219 --> 10:12.989
When I was a child, several of us were
sent into the woods for 10 days alone.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.826
10 days alone?

10:15.986 --> 10:17.744
It is a rite of passage among my people.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.871
<i>No food, no water.</i>

10:20.172 --> 10:21.935
Forced to survive on our own.

10:22.181 --> 10:24.542
None of us believed we could endure it,
but all of us did.

10:26.747 --> 10:28.004
I went to summer camp.

10:29.823 --> 10:31.094
There were other kids.

10:32.378 --> 10:33.731
We had cabins.

10:33.991 --> 10:35.136
With beds.

10:37.218 --> 10:39.350
And electricity, and food.

10:39.732 --> 10:41.017
I see.

10:41.837 --> 10:43.682
I didn't even make it three days.

10:43.832 --> 10:45.212
I got homesick,

10:45.472 --> 10:47.315
called my parents to come and get me.

11:04.729 --> 11:05.835
The weapons cache?

11:07.517 --> 11:10.587
Well, where are the weapons?
Obviously, the Bola Kai don't have them.

11:10.750 --> 11:13.077
My people must have need them
to fight off the attack,

11:13.836 --> 11:16.002
but then why were they not successful?

11:16.159 --> 11:18.831
The Bola Kai's weapons
would have been no match against these.

11:24.504 --> 11:25.760
Over there.
- What?

11:25.897 --> 11:28.093
There is a blind across the river.
- A blind?

11:28.229 --> 11:29.910
For hunting. It is well hidden.

11:30.047 --> 11:31.906
It will provide shelter for the night.

11:43.851 --> 11:45.423
We're going to cross that?

11:46.066 --> 11:47.801
<i>It is the quickest way across.</i>

11:49.400 --> 11:51.232
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

11:54.526 --> 11:56.821
My people built it. It is quite safe.

11:56.958 --> 11:58.010
I'm...

11:58.406 --> 11:59.929
I'm sure it is. It-it's just...

12:01.427 --> 12:03.504
Well, my... my ankle,

12:03.641 --> 12:05.745
and I've also got this...

12:05.978 --> 12:07.782
inner ear thing.

12:08.255 --> 12:10.619
We call it vertigo, and...

12:11.183 --> 12:12.443
God, look at it!

12:15.442 --> 12:18.341
There comes a point in adversity
when fear disappears,

12:18.477 --> 12:20.700
leaving only the will to survive.
- I know,

12:20.862 --> 12:23.098
it's just, I don't think I'm even

12:23.535 --> 12:25.844
remotely close to that point.

12:27.553 --> 12:28.619
Fine.

12:28.865 --> 12:30.027
Stay here then.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.804
Oh, well, wait! I mean, I...

12:33.610 --> 12:34.772
I'm sure I could...

12:34.922 --> 12:36.726
I could climb down and find a...

12:37.756 --> 12:40.060
Shallow spot in the river to cross.

12:40.210 --> 12:42.657
I mean, it might take me
a little longer but...

12:48.965 --> 12:50.250
Oh, God...

12:53.120 --> 12:54.446
Here we go.

12:57.357 --> 12:59.052
It's perfectly safe...

12:59.653 --> 13:00.924
Perfectly

13:01.074 --> 13:02.154
safe.

13:03.029 --> 13:04.272
Wobbly...

13:04.640 --> 13:06.199
Too wobbly...

13:28.368 --> 13:29.783
Almost there...

14:15.228 --> 14:16.231
Thank you.

14:17.596 --> 14:18.649
Come on.

14:25.724 --> 14:27.383
Maybe your people managed to

14:27.503 --> 14:29.635
make it to the Gate and escape.

14:30.921 --> 14:31.973
All of them?

14:32.561 --> 14:34.203
Well, I don't know, maybe.

14:34.653 --> 14:37.507
I mean, we haven't found
any bodies, right?

14:39.283 --> 14:42.034
From what you've said,
I doubt the Bola Kai would...

14:42.906 --> 14:45.162
take the time to bury their victims.

14:45.731 --> 14:46.538
No,

14:47.113 --> 14:48.367
they do not...

14:48.937 --> 14:52.908
because when they are done with their
victims, usually very little remains.

14:54.192 --> 14:56.022
What are you telling me,
they're cannibals?

14:59.205 --> 15:00.216
Teyla?

15:47.169 --> 15:48.462
Are you all right?

15:48.582 --> 15:50.285
Yeah.
- Stay here.

15:50.447 --> 15:53.037
What? Teyla! Teyla!

17:05.103 --> 17:07.914
That's one's dead, but...
He's still alive.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.123
We cannot afford to take prisoners.

17:19.604 --> 17:22.730
Well, we could... We could have tied
him up and left him in the woods.

17:22.849 --> 17:26.714
Then the others would have found him
and released him to rejoin the hunt.

17:30.032 --> 17:31.567
<i>I know it is difficult to accept,</i>

17:31.756 --> 17:34.513
but the fewer of them,
the better our chances at survival.

17:58.552 --> 18:00.565
His hands are tied.
He must have been a...

18:00.685 --> 18:01.833
a prisoner.

18:05.221 --> 18:08.589
He's got a stab wound to his abdomen.
Will you get me my medical kit?

18:09.034 --> 18:10.425
We have to leave him.

18:10.871 --> 18:13.031
What are you talking about?
He's one of your people.

18:13.181 --> 18:14.802
He is not Athosian.

18:16.908 --> 18:18.668
But his... his clothes...

18:18.788 --> 18:20.482
I have never seen him before.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.273
He's obviously not one of them,
and if I don't suture his wound,

18:23.393 --> 18:25.070
he's going to bleed to death.

18:25.268 --> 18:27.233
More Bola Kai will be here very soon.

18:27.792 --> 18:30.486
I know, but this won't take long, okay?
Please?

18:44.467 --> 18:45.467
Well...

18:48.967 --> 18:50.907
I got the bleeding under control.

18:52.158 --> 18:55.080
If the wound doesn't get infected,
he should be okay.

18:55.924 --> 18:57.363
It will be dark soon.

18:57.783 --> 18:59.724
Stay here with him.
I will find the blind.

18:59.998 --> 19:02.435
Is it far?
<i>- No.</i>

19:47.084 --> 19:49.157
Did you find it?
- Yes.

19:49.881 --> 19:50.907
How is he?

19:51.248 --> 19:52.847
Unconscious, but stable.

19:53.651 --> 19:54.855
Can he be moved?

19:55.192 --> 19:57.514
Oh, I don't know. He shouldn't be.

19:57.842 --> 20:00.118
His condition's precarious.
I would hate to...

20:00.629 --> 20:02.076
Yes, he can be moved.

20:12.133 --> 20:14.280
Water from the river.
- Thank you.

20:17.031 --> 20:20.441
I have laid traps around the perimeter.
If any Bola Kai come near,

20:20.561 --> 20:22.965
hopefully, we will hear them
before they discover us.

20:23.730 --> 20:24.657
Good.

20:26.130 --> 20:27.401
How's your ankle?

20:28.967 --> 20:30.775
The swelling's not too bad...

20:31.530 --> 20:34.385
And the pain's eased up,
thanks to the painkillers.

20:34.746 --> 20:36.598
If you wish to sleep, I can...

20:38.782 --> 20:39.782
What?

21:11.726 --> 21:12.733
What is that?

21:14.870 --> 21:16.193
Dinner.

21:16.565 --> 21:18.743
<i>They are attracted
to the warmth of our bodies.</i>

21:28.343 --> 21:31.043
The taste leaves much to be desired,
but it will sustain you.

21:32.962 --> 21:35.163
No, thanks, I'm not hungry.

21:35.327 --> 21:36.298
You should eat.

21:36.995 --> 21:39.216
This was my least
favorite part of survivor.

21:48.091 --> 21:49.993
He's regaining consciousness.

21:54.593 --> 21:57.361
It's okay. You're safe now.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.363
Who are you?

21:59.994 --> 22:01.621
Nabel Golan...

22:02.905 --> 22:03.991
of the Genii.

22:04.343 --> 22:05.693
The Genii?

22:05.966 --> 22:07.218
What are you doing here?

22:07.360 --> 22:08.871
I was planted

22:09.356 --> 22:12.166
to work inside the Athosian community...

22:12.906 --> 22:14.509
To gather intel.

22:15.274 --> 22:16.505
What happened to them?

22:17.967 --> 22:18.839
Dead.

22:19.648 --> 22:20.933
<i>All of them.</i>

22:26.277 --> 22:27.944
Who killed my people?

22:29.011 --> 22:30.017
Wraith.

22:30.248 --> 22:32.186
<i>A culling. Entire settlement.</i>

22:32.967 --> 22:34.106
Not the Bola Kai?

22:35.619 --> 22:38.968
Bola Kai were the ones
who told the Wraith about them.

22:39.952 --> 22:42.279
The Bola Kai are Wraith worshipers?

22:43.273 --> 22:44.749
I was able to...

22:44.912 --> 22:47.285
escape during the attack,

22:47.405 --> 22:50.414
but I was cut off from the Gate.

22:50.817 --> 22:53.582
<i>Bola Kai were guarding it.</i>

22:54.261 --> 22:55.737
They captured me.

22:55.888 --> 22:57.364
I have never seen you before.

22:57.514 --> 22:59.619
How long have you lived among my people?

22:59.755 --> 23:02.338
I only arrived a few days ago.

23:10.554 --> 23:11.727
Where are you from?

23:13.339 --> 23:15.557
She is a friend of mine
from another world.

23:15.735 --> 23:18.222
Your equipment, it looks ancestral.

23:18.454 --> 23:20.152
<i>We discovered it in our travels.</i>

23:20.545 --> 23:22.540
We have been away
for some time, trading.

23:22.677 --> 23:23.739
<i>Trading?</i>

23:24.617 --> 23:25.574
With who?

23:27.898 --> 23:30.631
If you are still seeking intel,

23:30.973 --> 23:33.999
then you are wasting
what few breaths you have remaining.

23:34.441 --> 23:35.521
<i>So say,</i>

23:35.670 --> 23:37.501
<i>"thank you for saving me",</i>

23:37.831 --> 23:40.172
and be done with this discussion.

23:42.382 --> 23:43.571
Thank you...

23:44.391 --> 23:45.844
for saving me.

24:02.189 --> 24:04.280
You have not slept all night.

24:04.854 --> 24:06.958
With people trying to kill us and...

24:07.095 --> 24:09.825
creatures crawling around
under the ground?

24:12.268 --> 24:14.357
Not to mention I'm starving.

24:20.438 --> 24:22.024
Not that starving.

24:22.393 --> 24:25.183
It will give you strength.
- It'll make me puke.

24:26.895 --> 24:29.218
You do not believe
you are capable of eating it,

24:29.338 --> 24:31.223
and so you do not.

24:31.943 --> 24:34.212
No, I think it's disgusting,

24:34.362 --> 24:35.906
and so I do not.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.896
I have a friend like you,

24:42.002 --> 24:43.485
afraid to challenge himself.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.071
I'm not afraid of challenges.

24:47.888 --> 24:49.407
I signed up to be chief of medicine

24:49.527 --> 24:51.823
on an expedition
in a whole other galaxy.

24:52.561 --> 24:54.371
That's about as challenging as it gets,

24:55.472 --> 24:57.374
<i>but eating gross food?</i>

24:57.864 --> 25:00.761
Sorry, but that's where I draw the line.

25:02.205 --> 25:03.618
Fair enough.

25:34.014 --> 25:34.953
<i>See?</i>

25:35.476 --> 25:37.371
No puking.

25:37.964 --> 25:39.002
Yet.

25:43.344 --> 25:44.482
So this...

25:44.988 --> 25:46.505
friend of yours...

25:47.531 --> 25:49.430
One of your team members?

25:50.045 --> 25:53.291
A certain uptight astrophysicist maybe?

25:54.179 --> 25:55.245
No.

25:55.983 --> 25:57.336
Athosian.

25:58.703 --> 26:00.507
His name is Kanan.

26:01.149 --> 26:03.842
A natural leader,
but he is unaware of it,

26:04.511 --> 26:06.520
burdened by an overly

26:06.712 --> 26:08.666
cautious nature.

26:10.197 --> 26:12.324
He's more than a friend, isn't he?

26:13.505 --> 26:15.367
<i>He's the one you were coming to see.</i>

26:16.116 --> 26:17.119
The hot date.

26:19.655 --> 26:21.870
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.

26:22.020 --> 26:24.480
I should just learn to shut up.

26:25.219 --> 26:27.005
We have known each other
since childhood,

26:27.979 --> 26:31.287
but only recently kindled
more than a friendship.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.369
I have not told anyone yet.

26:42.047 --> 26:43.480
I'm so sorry.

26:46.817 --> 26:49.017
We need more water.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.166
We have to leave.

27:15.738 --> 27:17.907
What happened?
- Can you walk?

27:18.640 --> 27:20.324
I don't even think he can stand.

27:20.457 --> 27:22.347
Very soon, many more
Bola Kai will be here.

27:22.470 --> 27:23.477
It's all right.

27:23.639 --> 27:24.930
I can walk.

27:30.631 --> 27:32.571
Mr. Freeze, no, King Tut.

27:32.722 --> 27:34.551
Wrong on both.
Otto Breminger was Mr. Freeze.

27:34.674 --> 27:36.341
Victor Buono was King Tut.

27:36.464 --> 27:39.060
Vincent Price was Egghead.
- Egghead, right.

27:39.256 --> 27:40.556
Okay, so, Cliff Robertson?

27:40.686 --> 27:42.668
Oh, I know this one.
Played the cowboy, right?

27:42.805 --> 27:45.332
Hey. Teyla and Keller get back?

27:46.092 --> 27:48.130
I haven't heard from them yet.
- They're late.

27:48.573 --> 27:50.635
That doesn't sound like Teyla.
- No, it doesn't.

27:50.786 --> 27:52.493
Well, she had that big feast last night.

27:52.616 --> 27:55.050
Maybe she did too much celebrating,
and needs to sleep it off.

27:55.987 --> 27:57.600
Yeah, that sounds like Teyla.

27:58.106 --> 27:59.459
Let's give her a call.

28:01.858 --> 28:03.415
Shame.
- What is?

28:03.535 --> 28:05.394
Cliff Robertson.
The villain he played, Shame.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.856
Very good. Shelley Winters.

28:07.506 --> 28:09.231
What the hell are you talking about?

28:12.415 --> 28:13.527
I need to rest.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.550
He is slowing us down,

28:26.670 --> 28:28.952
and he is making
your ankle injury worse.

28:29.526 --> 28:32.192
Well, if we leave him behind,
the Bola Kai are going to capture him.

28:32.328 --> 28:35.096
If we continue this way,
we will all be captured.

28:40.942 --> 28:41.949
Look,

28:42.686 --> 28:44.328
I'm the first to admit

28:44.546 --> 28:47.389
I'm not very good at certain things.

28:48.068 --> 28:49.534
I'm not athletic,

28:50.395 --> 28:51.441
I can't cook,

28:51.740 --> 28:54.194
and you don't even want to hear me
try to play the piano,

28:54.433 --> 28:57.692
but I do think I'm a pretty good
judge of character,

28:57.938 --> 28:59.263
and I know that you

28:59.780 --> 29:01.628
would never sacrifice an innocent man,

29:01.956 --> 29:03.912
not even if he was a complete stranger,

29:04.498 --> 29:05.865
to save yourself,

29:06.835 --> 29:10.627
which means the only reason you would
even suggest it would be because of me.

29:10.955 --> 29:12.033
I brought you here.

29:12.156 --> 29:14.918
This is my responsibility.
If anything should happen to you...

29:15.083 --> 29:16.503
I signed up for this,

29:16.721 --> 29:18.635
all right? All of it.

29:19.444 --> 29:21.805
I may not have had any idea
what I was getting into,

29:21.965 --> 29:22.824
but...

29:22.947 --> 29:25.999
that makes me no different
from anybody else on Atlantis.

29:27.854 --> 29:30.724
I'm glad you feel that way...
- Oh, yeah, I know, I know.

29:30.861 --> 29:33.982
Before this is all over, I'm gonna have
to find all the courage I can muster.

29:35.466 --> 29:36.696
<i>Actually...</i>

29:37.272 --> 29:39.607
You're going to need
to find it right now.

29:40.769 --> 29:41.946
Oh, God.

30:09.414 --> 30:10.185
Teyla!

30:24.105 --> 30:25.836
<i>Teyla? This is Atlantis, do you read?</i>

30:29.302 --> 30:30.791
Teyla, this is Sheppard,

30:31.242 --> 30:32.295
come in.

30:32.993 --> 30:34.593
She wouldn't turn off her radio.

30:34.864 --> 30:35.998
No, she wouldn't.

30:37.433 --> 30:39.251
Calling anyone
in the Athosian settlement,

30:39.388 --> 30:41.417
this is Lieutenant Colonel
John Sheppard.

30:41.547 --> 30:42.695
Do you copy?

30:44.103 --> 30:47.383
<i>Teyla, this is Sheppard,
please respond...</i>

31:01.271 --> 31:02.821
What are they going to do to us?

31:05.262 --> 31:07.421
They will try to extricate information.

31:08.404 --> 31:09.786
We must tell them nothing.

31:12.684 --> 31:15.834
Dr. Keller, the lives of everyone
in Atlantis are at stake.

31:17.799 --> 31:18.934
I know.

31:22.241 --> 31:23.485
I'm sorry.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.311
Where are you from?

31:30.032 --> 31:31.056
What?

31:31.494 --> 31:32.628
Your home?

31:34.868 --> 31:37.425
Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.

31:39.056 --> 31:40.485
A little town.

31:41.976 --> 31:43.411
Do you have any family?

31:43.889 --> 31:45.147
Just my dad.

31:45.913 --> 31:47.690
My mom died a few years back.

31:47.977 --> 31:48.825
I'm sorry.

31:50.057 --> 31:51.703
You must miss him.

31:53.498 --> 31:55.151
I'm all he's got left.

31:55.933 --> 31:59.033
Then you must do
everything you can to survive,

32:00.058 --> 32:01.534
<i>to return home.</i>

32:02.095 --> 32:03.188
You must...

32:07.164 --> 32:09.054
You will survive.

32:09.310 --> 32:11.558
You will return home.
Do you understand?

32:31.246 --> 32:32.537
Who are you?

32:33.419 --> 32:34.539
I am Athosian.

32:42.141 --> 32:43.505
I don't believe you.

32:44.368 --> 32:46.508
I do not care what you believe.

32:51.248 --> 32:54.142
The longer you are silent,
the worse it will be for you.

32:55.726 --> 32:57.020
<i>I told you.</i>

32:57.325 --> 32:59.124
We are Athosian,

32:59.430 --> 33:02.107
and you will suffer for what
you have done to our people.

33:02.633 --> 33:04.025
What we've done?

33:04.188 --> 33:06.820
You murdered them, an entire village.

33:07.077 --> 33:09.236
That village was deserted
when we arrived.

33:09.370 --> 33:12.142
Deserted because
it was culled by the Wraith,

33:12.262 --> 33:14.369
Wraith who were brought here by you.

33:14.662 --> 33:16.286
Do you know who we are?

33:16.450 --> 33:17.647
You are Bola Kai.

33:17.770 --> 33:20.168
Then you know we are hunted
by the Wraith like everyone else.

33:20.627 --> 33:23.545
Unless you are Wraith worshipers.

33:26.490 --> 33:27.674
Get her out of here!

33:37.995 --> 33:39.771
<i>I'm willing to spare her life</i>

33:40.964 --> 33:42.276
if you tell me

33:42.700 --> 33:44.258
who you are.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.170
Did you tell them anything?

34:05.586 --> 34:07.506
They said they would kill you.

34:07.668 --> 34:09.424
You told them about Atlantis?

34:09.976 --> 34:11.027
No.

34:11.971 --> 34:12.982
I...

34:13.268 --> 34:15.059
I gave them a Gate address,

34:15.181 --> 34:17.431
an uninhabited planet,
just to throw them off,

34:18.425 --> 34:19.601
<i>buy us more time,</i>

34:19.763 --> 34:20.885
like you said.

34:26.462 --> 34:28.485
I don't think they're Wraith worshipers.

34:29.981 --> 34:31.190
That guy in there,

34:31.943 --> 34:34.784
he seemed surprised when you accused him
of working with the Wraith.

34:35.149 --> 34:37.327
<i>Why would he deny it if it was true?</i>

34:38.333 --> 34:40.780
I would think that would provide
an even more effective threat

34:40.902 --> 34:42.331
to get us to talk.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.607
So they just happened to arrive here

34:44.743 --> 34:46.956
moments after the settlement was culled?

34:47.271 --> 34:48.797
I find that a coincidence.

34:52.620 --> 34:55.592
Something just came through the portal,
a flying ship of some kind, but

34:55.759 --> 34:57.766
it disappeared before
we could do anything.

34:57.889 --> 34:59.172
You two, watch them.

35:00.371 --> 35:02.958
The rest of you,
get your weapons and come with me!

35:04.900 --> 35:06.335
Not much longer.

35:10.916 --> 35:13.523
Those guys guarding the Gates
certainly don't look Athosian.

35:13.661 --> 35:15.327
They're Bola Kai.
- What?

35:15.477 --> 35:17.049
It a warrior tribe. Ruthless.

35:17.185 --> 35:20.147
They like picking fights,
especially with tribes who are peaceful.

35:20.270 --> 35:22.159
Great, just what we need,
another bad guy.

35:22.293 --> 35:24.605
Don't worry. They're primitive.
We can handle them.

35:24.725 --> 35:26.157
Define primitive.

35:26.417 --> 35:28.638
Clubs and arrows.
- Hey, arrows can hurt.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.174
Only if you're stupid enough
to get hit in the ass with one.

35:31.723 --> 35:33.468
Life signs?
<i>- All over the place.</i>

35:33.811 --> 35:36.551
Mostly in the woods.
It's hard to get a visual from up here.

35:36.674 --> 35:39.706
All right, we'll have to go
on foot then. Gear up, boys.

35:40.100 --> 35:41.514
If these guys want a fight,

35:41.637 --> 35:43.072
happy to give it to 'em.

35:57.971 --> 35:58.910
John?

36:02.438 --> 36:03.288
Nabel...

36:04.051 --> 36:05.322
Move back.

36:10.201 --> 36:11.589
Where did you get the gun?

36:12.129 --> 36:15.670
The Athosians were not the only ones
with a hidden cache of weapons.

36:16.312 --> 36:18.805
The Bola Kai captured me
before I could get to mine.

36:24.252 --> 36:25.575
We need to get moving.

36:25.701 --> 36:27.546
They no doubt heard the gunfire.

36:40.408 --> 36:41.419
They coming?

36:41.556 --> 36:42.936
It does not appear so.

36:43.073 --> 36:44.754
I believe it is safe to rest.

36:48.445 --> 36:50.503
Thank you for coming for us.

36:50.891 --> 36:52.244
You saved my life.

36:52.532 --> 36:54.130
I figured I'd return the favor.

36:55.008 --> 36:56.361
I thought you were dead.

36:56.497 --> 36:57.851
Well, I can't die yet.

36:58.097 --> 37:01.012
I have far too many questions
I need answers to first.

37:02.905 --> 37:06.309
We can start with you giving me
the Gate address to Atlantis.

37:10.708 --> 37:12.512
I've got lifesigns, there,

37:12.675 --> 37:13.647
there,

37:13.783 --> 37:15.611
there, and there.

37:15.772 --> 37:18.575
That really narrows it down.
- That way.

37:18.903 --> 37:19.969
Really? Why?

37:20.120 --> 37:21.242
No reason.

37:21.596 --> 37:22.909
Good enough for me.

37:23.373 --> 37:24.726
Let's go.

37:27.065 --> 37:28.330
Why are you doing this?

37:28.493 --> 37:30.878
Just give me the address
and I'll let you go.

37:31.001 --> 37:32.085
I promise.

37:33.419 --> 37:36.338
I see you're not
as badly wounded as I thought.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.611
Oh, it's bad.

37:37.844 --> 37:40.017
I just have a high tolerance for pain.

37:40.263 --> 37:42.430
The address, and I'll let you go,

37:42.590 --> 37:43.913
<i>both of you.</i>

37:44.951 --> 37:46.099
You're lying.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.853
<i>You're not Genii, are you?</i>

37:49.352 --> 37:51.430
We have an understanding with them.

37:51.594 --> 37:54.984
They wouldn't need to resort
to these tactics in order to contact us.

37:56.581 --> 37:58.577
All right, so that part wasn't true,

37:58.714 --> 38:00.655
but I was captured by the Bola Kai.

38:01.857 --> 38:03.159
You're the Wraith worshiper.

38:04.768 --> 38:08.039
You're the one responsible
for the death of the Athosians.

38:11.082 --> 38:12.834
Unless I lied about that as well.

38:12.996 --> 38:14.879
What do you mean, they're not dead?

38:15.039 --> 38:16.875
Give me the Gate address,

38:16.998 --> 38:18.965
and I'll gladly tell you everything.

38:43.108 --> 38:45.326
Don't move.
- Untie me.

38:48.983 --> 38:51.581
Get out of the way.
- Give me the gun.

38:52.470 --> 38:53.918
I'll shoot you.

38:54.670 --> 38:57.295
No, you won't. You don't have it in you.

38:57.938 --> 38:59.090
<i>You're a doctor,</i>

38:59.550 --> 39:00.849
a healer...

39:01.928 --> 39:02.842
Not a killer.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.467
You're right, I am a healer,

39:07.657 --> 39:09.432
but first I need something to heal.

39:25.568 --> 39:26.866
What happened to my people?

39:29.101 --> 39:30.741
What happened to them?

39:59.826 --> 40:01.736
You okay?
- Yeah.

40:01.981 --> 40:03.089
What happened?

40:03.416 --> 40:05.488
My people, they are gone.

40:06.120 --> 40:08.881
What are you talking about?
All of them? What happened?

40:10.719 --> 40:11.881
Nabel!

40:15.899 --> 40:17.793
Where did he go?
- I didn't see.

40:18.290 --> 40:19.813
Who are you talking about?

40:20.523 --> 40:21.603
Not arrows!

40:21.753 --> 40:23.666
We need to move! Come on, let's go!

40:43.199 --> 40:44.224
Well...

40:45.276 --> 40:46.315
How you feeling?

40:46.998 --> 40:48.064
I am fine.

40:49.130 --> 40:50.783
Dr. Keller insists I remain in bed.

40:50.906 --> 40:52.752
She fears I have a concussion.

40:53.011 --> 40:54.651
Well, you should listen to her.

40:56.045 --> 40:57.890
We just got back from New Athos.

40:58.710 --> 41:00.282
The Bola Kai are all gone.

41:00.555 --> 41:02.017
Must have scared them off.

41:02.892 --> 41:04.518
Rodney's got teams going out there

41:04.655 --> 41:06.716
to collect clues about
what happened to your people.

41:07.347 --> 41:08.968
Did you find Nabel?

41:09.857 --> 41:12.527
Searched the entire planet,
no life signs.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.426
He must have escaped through the Gate.

41:14.563 --> 41:16.684
Or, more likely,
he's lying dead somewhere.

41:17.748 --> 41:20.168
He knows what happened to my people.

41:21.370 --> 41:22.792
I will find them.

41:22.927 --> 41:24.745
I know you will,
and we're going to help you,

41:24.882 --> 41:27.328
but you've got to rest
and get your strength back.

41:27.533 --> 41:29.597
Whoever did this will pay.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.016
I will make certain of it.

41:36.131 --> 41:37.921
Hey, Doc, how you feeling?

41:38.386 --> 41:41.141
Oh, it's just a sprain. I'll be fine.

41:42.105 --> 41:45.500
Why is it that you are allowed
to resume working, and I am not?

41:45.718 --> 41:48.384
Because I didn't take
half the beating you did.

41:48.664 --> 41:50.997
I have suffered worse.
- Yeah, well, I believe you,

41:51.161 --> 41:54.031
but you're on my turf now,
so you have to listen to me.

41:54.675 --> 41:56.326
I'll check in on you later.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.056
So...

42:01.668 --> 42:04.732
I got permission to go home
for a few days of R&R.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.777
God bless that
intergalactic gate bridge, huh?

42:08.921 --> 42:10.096
Anyway...

42:11.723 --> 42:13.409
I get to see my dad...

42:15.194 --> 42:17.370
And I have you to thank for that.

42:22.548 --> 42:24.627
How long must I stay here?

42:25.814 --> 42:27.755
About another day or so.

42:28.808 --> 42:29.757
I told you,

42:29.919 --> 42:31.153
I feel fine.

42:31.304 --> 42:32.927
I do not have a concussion.

42:33.272 --> 42:34.220
You're right.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.389
You don't.

42:37.236 --> 42:40.682
Teyla, I've looked over
your test results.

42:43.284 --> 42:44.929
There's something we need to talk about.
