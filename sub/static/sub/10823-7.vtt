<i>Trading lives, making
pacts... that's not God's way.</i>

00:05.778 --> 00:08.916
<i>A secret pact was signed
during the First World War</i>

00:08.943 --> 00:10.577
<i>that protected all of Ravenswood's soldiers</i>

00:10.579 --> 00:12.479
<i>and kept them alive.</i>

00:12.481 --> 00:15.481
<i>But the price... five teens had to die,</i>

00:15.483 --> 00:18.617
<i>five per war for every war after that.</i>

00:18.619 --> 00:20.252
<i>And now we're the marked ones.</i>

00:20.254 --> 00:22.621
<i>Remy, Luke, his sister Olivia,</i>

00:22.623 --> 00:25.257
<i>me... Caleb... and Miranda already dead,</i>

00:25.259 --> 00:26.792
<i>victim of this curse,</i>

00:26.794 --> 00:28.794
<i>but helping us figure
out whoever or whatever</i>

00:28.796 --> 00:30.528
<i>is making our lives a living hell.</i>

00:32.531 --> 00:34.332
<i>Previously on Ravenswood.</i>

00:34.334 --> 00:36.000
Springer hates me. He
hates my whole family.

00:36.002 --> 00:38.769
People are wising up
to that family of yours.

00:38.771 --> 00:40.205
We're following up on some leads

00:40.207 --> 00:41.406
related to a person of interest.

00:41.408 --> 00:42.607
You mean our mom.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.475
Maybe tomorrow night, you
can come over, we can...

00:44.477 --> 00:46.343
Watch movie, bake cookies.

00:46.345 --> 00:48.078
- I'll work it out.
- I'm sure you will.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.781
Otherwise it's the grinder for both of us.

00:51.783 --> 00:54.218
Mr. Rivers, I think we're family.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.186
Mr. Collins was right there in our kitchen

00:56.188 --> 00:57.321
with an orchard for my mother.

00:57.323 --> 00:58.455
There still are the jars.

00:58.457 --> 00:59.690
You're being pulled back here.

00:59.692 --> 01:01.490
You must have put yours back together.

01:01.492 --> 01:04.126
I know you must feel like prisoner.

01:05.696 --> 01:07.830
Stop it now.

01:07.832 --> 01:09.465
LUKE: So you've been
sleepwalking since the accident.

01:09.467 --> 01:11.166
You didn't think you should tell me this.

01:11.168 --> 01:13.001
I need you to be there while
I'm sleeping to make sure

01:13.003 --> 01:14.803
that nothing wakes me
till I want to wake up.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.473
(sighs)

01:22.478 --> 01:24.879
It's after 1 o'clock.

01:24.881 --> 01:26.715
Yeah, I had to take Remy home.

01:29.318 --> 01:30.785
Hello, Luke.

01:32.488 --> 01:34.855
Mr. Collins and I had
some business to talk over.

01:34.857 --> 01:37.124
Oh, one in the morning business?

01:39.628 --> 01:40.794
It is pretty late.

01:40.796 --> 01:43.297
That's all right. Finish your coffee.

01:43.299 --> 01:44.431
Luke, can I get you something?

01:44.433 --> 01:45.666
I don't think so.

01:52.139 --> 01:54.274
This is the one didn't sign out.

02:01.782 --> 02:03.149
How long has he been here?

02:03.151 --> 02:05.350
He was here when I got here, after twelve.

02:05.352 --> 02:06.318
Where were you?

02:06.320 --> 02:08.586
I was with Dillon, remember?

02:08.589 --> 02:09.821
What happened with you and Remy?

02:09.823 --> 02:11.423
Remy took us to the
place the pact was made.

02:11.425 --> 02:13.325
The whole thing ties straight to Collins

02:13.327 --> 02:14.326
and the funeral home.

02:14.328 --> 02:16.094
What does he want with Mom?

02:17.597 --> 02:19.698
Nothing good.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.865
(knocking on door)

02:21.867 --> 02:24.368
Hey, you said 10 minutes half an hour ago.

02:24.370 --> 02:26.870
Come on, lights out.

02:26.872 --> 02:28.606
Done.

02:28.608 --> 02:29.607
Did you talk to Mom?

02:29.609 --> 02:31.074
Yeah. She got there okay.

02:31.076 --> 02:32.376
Now come on, go to bed.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.079
Remy.

02:36.081 --> 02:38.315
Seriously, bedtime.

02:44.555 --> 02:46.623
Not that I'm complaining,
but what's that for?

02:46.625 --> 02:50.194
Nothing. For being Dad.

02:50.196 --> 02:52.329
For saying things like
"Seriously, bedtime."

02:54.832 --> 02:56.732
You let me know if you need anything.

02:56.734 --> 02:58.400
I will.

02:58.402 --> 02:59.568
Go to bed.

03:19.222 --> 03:21.122
CALEB: Remy saw the town sign the pact.

03:21.124 --> 03:22.523
MIRANDA: In her dream?

03:22.525 --> 03:24.692
Esther wasn't the only
Collins there that night.

03:24.694 --> 03:28.128
There was somebody else from
the family business there,

03:28.130 --> 03:30.765
and that is who Gabriel gave
the pact and the knife to.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.967
So where's the pact now?

03:32.969 --> 03:36.571
Passed on from Collins
to Collins, I assume.

03:37.773 --> 03:39.273
I'll look around in the morning.

03:39.275 --> 03:40.775
Do you think Collins
will show you where it is?

03:40.777 --> 03:42.276
Or Grunwald?

03:45.312 --> 03:48.749
But Grunwald has a watchdog.

03:48.751 --> 03:50.617
What's that going to help?

03:50.619 --> 03:53.854
The way she was talking to
it, I don't think it's a what.

03:53.856 --> 03:55.088
I think it's a who.

04:24.049 --> 04:25.583
(siren blaring)

04:36.160 --> 04:37.795
Don't you have anything
better to do in this town?

04:37.797 --> 04:39.463
You've already searched this house.

04:39.465 --> 04:41.732
New warrant, new search.

04:41.734 --> 04:43.567
- Let's see the warrant.
- I showed it to your mother, son.

04:43.569 --> 04:44.902
Now you're gonna show it to
me. Let's see the warrant.

04:44.904 --> 04:46.602
- Luke?
- Go back upstairs.

04:46.604 --> 04:48.938
I'm not going anywhere. What's happening?

04:48.940 --> 04:51.307
The cops got a warrant to search the house.

04:51.309 --> 04:52.508
What are they looking for?

04:53.777 --> 04:55.778
Mr. Kessel came in early
dug up the old hedge.

04:55.780 --> 04:57.112
He found something buried in there.

04:57.114 --> 04:58.781
What?

04:58.783 --> 05:00.063
A knife with a three-sided blade.

05:02.118 --> 05:03.819
Why does that give you the
right to come into our house?

05:03.821 --> 05:05.620
The knife that killed your
father had a three-sided blade.

05:05.622 --> 05:08.523
Both of you, go upstairs, get dressed.

05:08.525 --> 05:09.691
Now.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.533
(knocking on door)

05:25.640 --> 05:27.074
It's a guy.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.742
Older. I've never seen him before.

05:28.744 --> 05:30.143
You already looked?

05:37.250 --> 05:38.551
Dad.

05:38.553 --> 05:39.786
Hey, stranger.

05:39.788 --> 05:40.854
How are you?

05:40.856 --> 05:41.988
Good.

05:43.624 --> 05:44.791
Come in.

05:44.793 --> 05:47.193
The lady in the mortuary
said you were up here.

05:47.195 --> 05:49.629
Yeah, I'm here.

05:49.631 --> 05:52.430
When you called me, you didn't
say anything about staying here.

05:52.432 --> 05:53.866
Well, that wasn't the plan when we talked.

05:53.868 --> 05:55.868
But things changed.

05:55.870 --> 05:57.903
She said you work here.

05:57.905 --> 05:59.337
Yeah, I do.

05:59.339 --> 06:00.839
That sounds permanent.

06:00.841 --> 06:02.808
Did something happen with Hanna?

06:02.810 --> 06:04.776
That's complicated.

06:07.312 --> 06:09.614
Wait. Why? Did you talk to Hanna?

06:09.616 --> 06:10.882
I thought about it.

06:10.884 --> 06:13.417
But then I thought I
better talk to you first.

06:13.419 --> 06:16.654
Good call.

06:16.656 --> 06:18.455
Except I have business here.

06:26.664 --> 06:28.364
I got this from a lawyer here.

06:28.366 --> 06:31.334
This Henry Rivers died last week.

06:31.336 --> 06:33.202
Turns out, we're next of kin.

06:33.204 --> 06:35.405
I know. I met him.

06:37.207 --> 06:41.644
We played chess. And I lost badly.

06:41.646 --> 06:42.611
Is that why you're here?

06:42.613 --> 06:44.680
Because of Henry Rivers?

06:44.682 --> 06:46.214
(beeping)

06:51.421 --> 06:53.622
Hey, I got to take care of something.

06:53.624 --> 06:55.223
You want to meet up later?

06:55.225 --> 06:57.392
Yeah. I got to meet this lawyer.

06:57.394 --> 06:59.727
- So I'll call you after.
- All right, cool.

07:01.330 --> 07:03.865
I'll buy the coffee, but I
want you to do all the talking.

07:03.867 --> 07:05.534
I want to know what's going on.

07:05.536 --> 07:06.768
You will.

07:08.104 --> 07:09.538
All right, see you later.

07:14.609 --> 07:17.378
That's your dad who dumped
you into foster care?

07:17.380 --> 07:18.479
Yeah.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.481
Except I grew up thinking he was my uncle.

07:21.683 --> 07:23.284
He knows Hanna?

07:23.286 --> 07:25.719
She's the one who got us back together.

07:25.721 --> 07:27.454
He really likes her.

07:27.456 --> 07:29.655
Oh.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.091
Something else is going on.

07:34.695 --> 07:36.496
Go.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.165
I'll try talking to Grunwald's
guardian about the pact.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.433
Okay.

07:52.377 --> 07:53.712
(cell phone ringing)

08:16.200 --> 08:17.400
What did I do?

08:32.850 --> 08:34.082
Oh, my God.

09:04.412 --> 09:06.346
(message indicator beeps)

09:17.558 --> 09:18.858
Hold on.

09:18.860 --> 09:19.793
It's okay.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.498
- What is happening?
- They found a knife in our yard.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.667
- Collins must have stuck it there.
- Collins was here?

09:27.669 --> 09:29.429
Last night, while we
were chasing scarecrows.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.839
Luke, do you know what
kind of knife they found?

09:33.841 --> 09:35.107
What difference does
it make? It was planted.

09:35.109 --> 09:37.376
Beddington said it was a three-sided knife. 

09:37.378 --> 09:40.779
- Like this?
- Where'd you get this?

09:40.781 --> 09:43.583
Remy drew it from memory.
She saw it last night.

09:43.585 --> 09:45.650
You mean she saw it in 1917.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.452
(door opening)

09:47.454 --> 09:49.754
Luke.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.256
Hey, you can't arrest her.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.824
No one's being arrested.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.593
They just want to ask
me a couple of questions.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.195
- Should we come with you?
- No, I'll be back in a couple of hours.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.263
Mom, we're coming with you.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.964
No. No.

09:59.966 --> 10:01.832
Hey! Hey!

10:01.834 --> 10:03.300
Hey! You hurt her!

10:03.302 --> 10:04.435
- Drive.
- You be careful with her.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.736
Get out of here.

10:05.738 --> 10:07.070
- Wait! Stop!
- You hurt her!

10:07.072 --> 10:08.272
Luke.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.640
Luke.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.609
Let her go.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.943
You've got two seconds to
decide how this is going to work.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.478
Put him in my car.

10:16.547 --> 10:17.580
Luke, stop.

10:23.854 --> 10:24.920
You were hurting his mother.

10:24.922 --> 10:27.123
You want a ride too? I got plenty of room.

10:45.708 --> 10:47.708
CALEB: That's the guy who
used to work for Collins.

10:50.445 --> 10:52.747
Springer. Why's he here?

11:01.535 --> 11:03.002
All right, they're all gone.

11:03.004 --> 11:04.838
Front yard is free of invaders.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.240
Okay.

11:07.242 --> 11:08.441
Uh, what are you doing?

11:08.443 --> 11:10.275
Cleaning.

11:10.277 --> 11:12.644
The house is pretty clean.

11:12.646 --> 11:14.046
No, it's not.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.316
The police touched everything,
they moved everything.

11:17.318 --> 11:19.584
This is our house. Our stuff.

11:22.188 --> 11:24.323
Olivia, I don't think they're gonna
charge Luke with anything, all right?

11:24.325 --> 11:26.325
They just needed to take
him someplace to cool off.

11:28.193 --> 11:30.228
Right.

11:30.230 --> 11:31.663
And if they just want
to ask your mom questions

11:31.665 --> 11:33.398
and they can't hold her, either, so...

11:35.133 --> 11:37.635
Hey, right now it'll be a really good time

11:37.637 --> 11:38.936
to not go nuts.

11:43.941 --> 11:46.209
Look I'm supposed to go
meet my dad at the Vault,

11:46.211 --> 11:48.412
but I can put it off
if you need me to stay.

11:48.414 --> 11:49.580
Your dad's here?

11:49.582 --> 11:51.648
Yeah, he showed up this morning.

11:51.650 --> 11:53.450
That's kind of weird, don't you think?

11:53.452 --> 11:56.987
Family business...
something about Henry Rivers.

11:56.989 --> 12:00.289
Old Henry.

12:00.291 --> 12:02.658
The guy who actually died
from being scared to death.

12:02.660 --> 12:05.795
Nothing's gonna happen to my father, okay.

12:05.797 --> 12:07.630
We're the ones who are in danger.

12:07.632 --> 12:09.298
We are marked.

12:09.300 --> 12:12.902
My father wasn't marked,

12:12.904 --> 12:15.103
but he was murdered because of the pact.

12:16.539 --> 12:18.106
Go take care of your dad.

12:18.108 --> 12:20.041
I called Dillon. He'll be here by any time.

12:35.023 --> 12:36.490
What time is it?

12:38.794 --> 12:40.394
I don't know, they took my phone.

12:40.396 --> 12:45.032
Didn't ask to make a call,
I asked what time it is.

12:45.034 --> 12:46.900
I don't have a watch.

12:46.902 --> 12:48.568
Why didn't you say so?

12:50.738 --> 12:53.172
Hey, hey. Let me out of here.

12:53.174 --> 12:54.541
You calm down.

12:54.543 --> 12:56.075
I'm calm.

12:56.077 --> 12:58.411
I... I'm calm.

12:58.413 --> 12:59.546
I'm calm.

12:59.548 --> 13:00.747
I think we'll wait a little longer.

13:00.749 --> 13:01.947
Yeah.

13:01.949 --> 13:05.050
You're good at that, waiting around

13:05.052 --> 13:07.920
instead of trying to figure out who...

13:07.922 --> 13:09.721
who killed my dad.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.189
You know it may shock you
that I want to find out

13:11.191 --> 13:13.158
who killed your father
almost as much as you do.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.927
Then stop wasting time on my mom.

13:14.929 --> 13:16.662
What do you know about that knife?

13:16.664 --> 13:18.796
- Nothing.
- Come on.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.197
What kind of killer
holds onto a murder weapon

13:20.199 --> 13:22.066
two months after they commit a crime?

13:22.068 --> 13:24.335
Anybody could have planted it.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.036
You think about anybody in particular?

13:29.107 --> 13:30.842
They're testing it.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.410
Yeah?

13:33.412 --> 13:35.412
We'll know soon if it was
used to kill your father.

13:36.647 --> 13:38.114
Then what happens?

13:38.116 --> 13:40.116
Then what happens, huh?

13:40.118 --> 13:41.417
What happens?

14:01.404 --> 14:03.338
You should not have seen.

14:07.476 --> 14:08.910
What did you say?

14:08.912 --> 14:12.480
"If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out."

14:12.482 --> 14:16.450
You're gonna wish you were
dead before this is over.

14:16.452 --> 14:19.487
And then, you'll get your wish.

14:44.811 --> 14:46.512
Hey, Dillon, it's me.

14:46.514 --> 14:48.380
I...

14:48.382 --> 14:49.582
I don't know if you lost your phone,

14:49.584 --> 14:51.216
but I really need to talk to you right now.

14:51.218 --> 14:53.618
It's about my mother and my brother

14:53.620 --> 14:57.321
and even if wasn't something,
I really like to see you.

14:57.323 --> 14:58.657
(knocking on door)

14:58.659 --> 15:00.490
Oh, if that's you at the door,

15:00.492 --> 15:01.992
you are gonna get such a welcome.

15:03.995 --> 15:05.095
Dillon.

15:05.097 --> 15:07.397
Olivia.

15:07.399 --> 15:09.199
Are you all right?

15:09.201 --> 15:10.467
My mother's not home.

15:10.469 --> 15:12.469
I know. She called me.

15:12.471 --> 15:13.938
She asked me to check on you.

15:58.236 --> 16:00.516
I don't understand why she called you

16:00.560 --> 16:01.029
and not me.

16:01.075 --> 16:03.210
She thought I might be able to help.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.545
I'm going to the police,

16:04.547 --> 16:06.113
but I wanted to check on you first.

16:06.115 --> 16:08.048
They found a knife in our backyard.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.717
I heard about that.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.318
Somebody put it there.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.621
I'm sure that's what happened.

16:13.623 --> 16:15.255
You were here last night.

16:15.257 --> 16:16.822
Yes, I was.

16:16.824 --> 16:18.558
Did you hear anything?

16:18.560 --> 16:20.159
No.

16:20.161 --> 16:22.495
If I had, I would have investigated.

16:22.497 --> 16:24.096
I'm sure you realize

16:24.098 --> 16:25.398
there are lot of people in this town

16:25.400 --> 16:27.634
who have a very wrong
opinion of your mother.

16:27.636 --> 16:29.569
Yeah. They think she killed my dad.

16:31.237 --> 16:33.037
Even I know that's not true.

16:33.039 --> 16:34.673
Everybody liked my dad.

16:34.675 --> 16:36.975
He lived a life of great service.

16:36.977 --> 16:39.144
But you didn't like him.

16:39.146 --> 16:42.347
Your father and I disagreed.

16:44.150 --> 16:45.617
But I respected him.

16:45.619 --> 16:48.886
From all accounts he
was a very good father.

16:48.888 --> 16:51.088
And a good husband.

16:53.224 --> 16:54.325
Are you going to be all right

16:54.327 --> 16:56.260
if I leave and try to see your mother?

16:56.262 --> 16:58.729
What do you think you can do?

16:58.731 --> 17:01.165
I'll try to get her and your brother home.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.242
Olivia...

17:13.243 --> 17:17.646
when this situation is
resolved, I'd like to try.

17:17.648 --> 17:19.079
You'd like to try what?

17:22.385 --> 17:24.118
I'll call you if I have any news.

17:29.459 --> 17:31.660
So what happened with Hanna?

17:34.797 --> 17:37.665
We broke up. It happens.

17:37.667 --> 17:38.999
Why did it happen to you?

17:41.269 --> 17:44.939
- It's complicated.
- Uncomplicate it.

17:46.775 --> 17:49.143
Dad, it's over, okay?

17:49.145 --> 17:50.711
It doesn't even matter anymore.

17:50.713 --> 17:53.613
It mattered enough for you to switch towns.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.382
No, Hanna is not the
reason that I came here.

17:55.384 --> 17:56.416
What is?

17:59.821 --> 18:02.288
I just wasn't good for her.

18:04.692 --> 18:08.527
You starting to sound like
me, and I don't like it.

18:08.529 --> 18:10.262
Wise up, boy.

18:10.264 --> 18:12.331
Get your stuff go back to Rosewood.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.066
Tell her a story,

18:14.068 --> 18:17.403
tell her you fell on your head,

18:17.405 --> 18:18.637
but you're better now.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.173
Tell her that you still love her.

18:25.077 --> 18:28.179
I am not leaving Ravenswood, Dad.

18:32.385 --> 18:33.351
Neither am I.

18:35.654 --> 18:36.888
What?

18:36.890 --> 18:39.122
I have inherited myself a house.

18:41.559 --> 18:43.594
From Henry?

18:43.596 --> 18:47.564
Turns out you and I are
all the family he had left.

18:47.566 --> 18:49.032
Not sure what we're gonna do with it.

18:49.034 --> 18:50.267
We might sell it.

18:50.269 --> 18:53.370
This is a good thing, Caleb.

18:53.372 --> 18:56.272
And I've had a lot of
bad things happen lately.

18:57.941 --> 19:00.142
Don't you think it's just a little strange?

19:00.144 --> 19:03.245
I mean, Henry dies and
you're pulled to town.

19:04.782 --> 19:08.451
Let's just look at the house
and then we'll talk about it.

19:08.453 --> 19:09.985
Are you coming? I'm heading over.

19:12.288 --> 19:13.789
I remember drawing these

19:13.791 --> 19:16.425
because I didn't want
to forget any details.

19:16.427 --> 19:20.462
But when I fell asleep, I
just kept right on drawing.

19:22.164 --> 19:23.632
Thank God Mom's away.

19:23.634 --> 19:25.467
It's not the first time

19:25.469 --> 19:27.301
with the sleepwalking, the dreams.

19:27.303 --> 19:28.669
It happened when I was little.

19:28.671 --> 19:29.837
What did you do?

19:31.807 --> 19:33.507
Therapy, sleep meds.

19:33.509 --> 19:36.310
Was a little punchy there
for awhile, then it stopped.

19:36.312 --> 19:37.411
And now it's back.

19:37.413 --> 19:39.112
Except this time it's not just a dream.

19:39.114 --> 19:40.448
It's something else, something real

19:40.450 --> 19:42.349
that's inside my head.

19:42.351 --> 19:44.551
Maybe it was real the last time
and you just didn't know it.

19:44.553 --> 19:47.153
But now it's worse.

19:47.155 --> 19:49.923
And it's angry that I saw
the town signed the pact.

19:54.662 --> 19:56.228
You got your laptop in there?

19:58.531 --> 20:00.198
What are you thinking?

20:00.200 --> 20:02.434
I think I have a way of finding
out where the pact is now.

20:02.436 --> 20:04.235
How?

20:04.237 --> 20:06.705
Grunwald's guardian spook.

20:06.707 --> 20:09.074
But we need to know who she is.

20:09.076 --> 20:12.310
From what I saw, she looked
like she's from the 1940s.

20:34.632 --> 20:35.732
Livvy?

20:35.734 --> 20:36.933
Tess.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.605
Will you sit with me?

20:42.740 --> 20:44.273
Yeah.

20:44.275 --> 20:45.509
Thanks.

20:48.312 --> 20:49.812
Hey, what's up?

20:49.814 --> 20:51.180
Last of the P.O.W.'s

20:51.182 --> 20:53.116
got back from the Philippines
and a week later...

20:53.118 --> 20:55.118
... five kids died.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.720
It's the pattern.

20:57.722 --> 21:00.189
"Beatrice Meredith Stevens
has survived by her parents"

21:00.191 --> 21:01.657
Theo and Eleanor Stevens.

21:01.659 --> 21:04.259
And beloved sister of Theo Jr., Robert,

21:04.261 --> 21:05.394
"Daniel and Carla."

21:05.396 --> 21:07.129
Carla.

21:07.131 --> 21:08.630
Mrs. Grunwald's name is Carla.

21:08.632 --> 21:10.532
Think it's a coincidence?

21:10.534 --> 21:12.134
I don't believe in coincidences,

21:12.136 --> 21:13.635
not in this town.

21:13.637 --> 21:16.438
If Grunwald's maiden name was Stevens...

21:16.440 --> 21:19.740
County marriage records coming up.

21:19.742 --> 21:22.543
God, if Collins has
Grunwald's sister trapped here,

21:22.545 --> 21:24.978
it explains why she's
stuck working for him.

21:24.980 --> 21:27.581
If Grunwald's sister was
marked like us then maybe...

21:27.583 --> 21:30.518
She probably wants this
pact broken as much as we do.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.920
Exactly.

21:32.922 --> 21:35.388
It's kind of all over town,
what happened at your house.

21:36.790 --> 21:39.092
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

21:42.696 --> 21:44.297
Olivia?

21:46.700 --> 21:48.168
I thought I saw...

21:50.237 --> 21:52.171
I'm sorry, I'm not myself right now.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.640
I broke up with Springer.

21:57.410 --> 21:59.610
You were right, he's
cut but he's sour inside.

22:01.413 --> 22:04.215
Livvy, I'm pretty sure he's the one

22:04.217 --> 22:06.350
who threw that stuff at you at the parade.

22:11.523 --> 22:14.191
How long did Springer work for Mr. Collins?

22:14.193 --> 22:16.359
I don't know. Something like a year.

22:16.361 --> 22:18.395
So, he was there when Collins...

22:19.697 --> 22:20.997
when he worked on my dad.

22:20.999 --> 22:22.466
I suppose, yeah.

22:25.002 --> 22:29.206
Livvy, can we try to start over, please?

22:29.208 --> 22:32.108
I was such an idiot and I really miss you.

22:35.945 --> 22:38.880
I've had a couple of days I
really wanted to talk to you.

22:38.882 --> 22:40.849
So we can try?

22:40.851 --> 22:43.285
I think we're past trying.

22:43.287 --> 22:44.953
Good.

22:47.156 --> 22:48.656
So how are things with Dillon?

22:50.659 --> 22:51.993
I don't like that look.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.894
What look?

22:53.896 --> 22:56.197
I mean you get that look
after you mention a boyfriend,

22:56.199 --> 22:58.099
it means that you either broke up or you...

23:01.370 --> 23:03.737
Olivia.

23:03.739 --> 23:04.971
Really?

23:04.973 --> 23:06.273
- You did it?
- Yeah.

23:08.709 --> 23:11.211
You and Dillon have been dating forever.

23:11.213 --> 23:12.446
SIMON: Remy, you know your mother

23:12.448 --> 23:13.580
is at a medical conference.

23:13.582 --> 23:15.048
I've been a nervous wreck.

23:15.050 --> 23:17.184
- Why'd you leave the house?
- It was important.

23:17.186 --> 23:19.652
You didn't tell me where you
were going or when you'd be back.

23:19.654 --> 23:21.220
I'm okay, Dad.

23:21.222 --> 23:22.588
I know you're worried about Luke,

23:22.590 --> 23:24.357
but I'm terrified of
what's happening to you.

23:25.459 --> 23:28.161
Your mom and I talked

23:28.163 --> 23:29.862
and she made an appointment for you.

23:29.864 --> 23:32.498
I'm not taking those pills again.

23:32.500 --> 23:33.999
Take it easy.

23:34.001 --> 23:35.066
Take it easy, all right.

23:35.068 --> 23:37.502
It's not going to be like that.

23:37.504 --> 23:39.437
This is different. It's a different doctor.

23:39.439 --> 23:41.239
And we're gonna figure this out

23:41.241 --> 23:43.508
and we're gonna get through this together.

23:45.311 --> 23:48.146
Team Beaumont, remember?

23:53.318 --> 23:55.753
If I go quietly, will
you do something for me?

23:55.755 --> 23:57.789
This isn't a hostage negotiation.

24:05.463 --> 24:06.897
Will you help Luke?

24:11.569 --> 24:13.269
JAMIE: Water damage up in the attic.

24:13.271 --> 24:14.571
Some of the flooring will have to come up,

24:14.573 --> 24:16.106
but the place has good bones.

24:16.108 --> 24:18.108
CALEB: Good what?

24:18.110 --> 24:19.275
Bones.

24:19.277 --> 24:23.312
Good beams, solid foundation.

24:23.314 --> 24:24.680
Right.

24:24.682 --> 24:26.215
Wouldn't take more than six or seven months

24:26.217 --> 24:28.017
to turn the place around.

24:28.019 --> 24:31.286
Wait... six months?

24:31.288 --> 24:32.354
I thought you wanted to sell it.

24:32.356 --> 24:34.256
If I put six months into this place,

24:34.258 --> 24:36.425
I can add 30,000 to the asking price.

24:38.195 --> 24:40.561
So you would stay here for six months?

24:40.563 --> 24:45.033
Well, you told me it was complicated.

24:45.035 --> 24:47.602
I thought six months would
be long enough to explain,

24:47.604 --> 24:49.503
but if you need more time.

24:49.505 --> 24:53.742
No, Dad, just call a realtor and list it.

24:53.744 --> 24:55.476
Sell it today, if you can.

24:55.478 --> 24:59.113
I'll sell it when I'm ready.

24:59.115 --> 25:01.048
And your name will be
on the deed when I do.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.886
Unless you want to keep it.

25:05.888 --> 25:08.122
You know, you really
should be giving lectures

25:08.124 --> 25:09.923
on putting down roots.

25:11.159 --> 25:12.559
What the hell's eating you?

25:12.561 --> 25:14.060
You just got here and all of a sudden

25:14.062 --> 25:16.028
you're talking about homesteading.

25:16.030 --> 25:18.931
We've got family here we
didn't know anything about.

25:18.933 --> 25:20.267
Don't you want to find out who they were?

25:20.269 --> 25:22.769
No. Not especially.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.505
Then why'd you visit Henry
Rivers before he died?

25:25.507 --> 25:27.873
Why did you call me and
ask me about this town?

25:30.677 --> 25:31.910
You know what?

25:31.912 --> 25:34.346
Maybe I just need a little
elbow room, all right.

25:34.348 --> 25:36.882
Maybe I don't like the
idea of you crowding me.

25:36.884 --> 25:38.250
What's that supposed to mean?

25:38.252 --> 25:40.653
It means maybe one of the
reasons I broke up with Hanna

25:40.655 --> 25:42.354
was because you were
pushing me to be with her.

25:42.356 --> 25:44.188
I wasn't pushing you anywhere.

25:44.190 --> 25:45.690
I'm gonna choose the girl
that I want to be with

25:45.692 --> 25:47.558
and I don't need your advice.

25:47.560 --> 25:50.127
I mean, your track record
isn't exactly solid.

25:52.264 --> 25:54.365
Caleb, what's going on here?

25:56.201 --> 25:58.603
What's going on here is my business.

25:58.605 --> 26:02.105
Okay, so I think you need
to sell this house or burn it

26:02.107 --> 26:03.640
for the insurance and stop chasing me

26:03.642 --> 26:05.108
around half of Pennsylvania.

26:15.152 --> 26:17.620
So you and Olivia are girlfriends again.

26:21.057 --> 26:22.425
Stop spying on people, Springer.

26:22.427 --> 26:23.693
It's creepy.

26:23.695 --> 26:25.294
I have a first name, you know?

26:25.296 --> 26:27.129
I've already forgotten it.

26:27.131 --> 26:28.764
What did you talk to her about?

26:28.766 --> 26:32.061
- Why are you bothering me?
- Because I need to know what's going on.

26:32.062 --> 26:34.402
- I mean, I'm out here on my own.
- And whose fault is that?

26:34.404 --> 26:35.870
I have to take it from Dillon,

26:35.872 --> 26:37.505
but I don't have to take it from you.

26:37.507 --> 26:41.175
Then why don't you go and find your
friend Dillon and leave me alone?

26:41.177 --> 26:43.311
You've got a real bromance, the two of you.

26:44.480 --> 26:46.548
You know, being nice to Olivia,

26:46.550 --> 26:48.916
it isn't going to save you.

26:48.918 --> 26:51.352
I don't know why I ever
saw you as a B-plus.

27:01.029 --> 27:02.663
MIRANDA: Beatrice?

27:02.665 --> 27:04.998
Beatrice Stevens?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.432
Come out, come out wherever you are.

27:06.434 --> 27:07.968
Beatrice.

27:13.274 --> 27:15.108
I know Grunwald's your sister.

27:15.110 --> 27:16.843
Was she older than you?

27:16.845 --> 27:19.279
Did she pick on you?

27:19.281 --> 27:22.214
Was she jealous because
your mom liked you best?

27:22.216 --> 27:24.383
(music blares suddenly from radio)

27:24.385 --> 27:26.618
Getting warmer?

27:26.620 --> 27:29.521
We have something in common.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.924
We both died because of the pact.

27:31.926 --> 27:35.494
Now we're stuck here... forever.

27:37.363 --> 27:39.230
Oh, my God.

27:39.232 --> 27:40.999
Red hot.

27:44.169 --> 27:46.304
Tell me what you know about the pact, Bea.

27:46.306 --> 27:48.072
Who's keeping us here?

27:48.074 --> 27:49.573
It can't just be my uncle.

27:49.575 --> 27:51.842
This has been going on
from almost 100 years.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.710
Why are they doing this?

27:53.712 --> 27:56.413
Why do kids have to keep dying?

27:56.415 --> 27:59.283
We can break this curse, Bea.

27:59.285 --> 28:01.351
Maybe even get out of here.

28:01.353 --> 28:05.588
Grunwald won't be able to
push you around anymore.

28:05.590 --> 28:08.090
(vibrating)

28:23.640 --> 28:26.271
Don't look at that.

28:47.388 --> 28:49.447
MIRANDA: Your tea's probably cold by now.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.044
You've been sitting there
and staring at that cemetery

28:51.046 --> 28:52.478
for, like, 10 minutes.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.215
Think those headstones
are gonna start moving?

28:55.217 --> 28:57.783
Around here? Possibly.

29:06.327 --> 29:07.926
I pissed off Grunwald's ghost.

29:10.062 --> 29:11.162
How'd you do that?

29:11.164 --> 29:13.699
I don't know.

29:13.701 --> 29:15.434
Sometimes I rub spirits the wrong way.

29:17.637 --> 29:18.737
Where's your dad?

29:20.673 --> 29:22.541
Hopefully on his way back home by now.

29:24.309 --> 29:25.443
What happened?

29:25.445 --> 29:28.178
I acted like a spoiled jerk.

29:28.180 --> 29:29.580
Deliberately?

29:31.783 --> 29:32.850
I'm just asking.

29:32.852 --> 29:34.352
Yes.

29:34.354 --> 29:35.686
Deliberately.

29:37.522 --> 29:39.389
I don't want him to get hurt.

29:39.391 --> 29:40.957
Collateral damage.

29:45.630 --> 29:47.731
Look I get that you want to keep him safe,

29:47.733 --> 29:50.032
but from my unique point of view,

29:50.034 --> 29:54.804
I worry if the last time
you guys talked was a fight.

29:56.339 --> 29:58.407
We don't know what's gonna to happen.

29:58.409 --> 30:01.610
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

30:06.015 --> 30:07.816
Were you surprised

30:07.818 --> 30:09.551
when you found out your uncle was your dad?

30:09.553 --> 30:11.952
Yeah.

30:11.954 --> 30:13.788
For a second. But then it made sense.

30:13.790 --> 30:15.122
Why?

30:15.124 --> 30:18.593
Hanna showed me this
picture that Jamie had of him

30:18.595 --> 30:20.728
holding me when I was a baby.

30:20.730 --> 30:22.697
Were you cute?

30:22.699 --> 30:23.998
Adorable.

30:26.669 --> 30:28.669
The way he was holding me.

30:28.671 --> 30:30.370
Once you knew, you knew.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.341
That was a father holding his kid.

30:42.583 --> 30:44.750
- Remy.
- I'm in here.

30:46.853 --> 30:47.886
We've got company.

30:49.289 --> 30:50.222
Luke!

30:54.828 --> 30:59.298
Mr. Beaumont, thanks again.

31:00.499 --> 31:01.700
You're welcome.

31:20.852 --> 31:23.119
Do you like my portfolio?

31:23.121 --> 31:25.021
You did this while you were asleep?

31:25.023 --> 31:29.626
I wasn't awake, but was
I asleep? Good question.

31:30.962 --> 31:32.695
Is this the same language?

31:32.697 --> 31:33.896
That was in the prayer book?

31:33.898 --> 31:35.465
No, this is Latin.

31:36.933 --> 31:38.434
What, can you translate it?

31:38.436 --> 31:40.336
On my laptop, but it's slow going.

31:40.338 --> 31:42.538
- What have you got?
- I think it's a warning.

31:42.540 --> 31:45.875
<i>"Finis est praesens, attingere."</i>

31:45.877 --> 31:49.110
"To interfere is to face the end of all."

31:49.112 --> 31:51.279
Luke, did I make this happen?

31:51.281 --> 31:54.048
- What do you mean?
- "You should not have seen."

31:54.050 --> 31:57.786
I went in there and I saw
how it all started and, now,

31:57.788 --> 31:59.855
maybe something followed me back?

32:01.957 --> 32:03.824
MIRANDA: Mrs. Grunwald wasn't your sister.

32:03.826 --> 32:06.660
She... she was your daughter.

32:12.534 --> 32:16.169
You were a teenager, you got pregnant.

32:16.171 --> 32:18.506
You and your mom went away and...

32:18.508 --> 32:20.774
came back with a new sister.

32:20.776 --> 32:24.744
People believed it, or
pretended to believe it.

32:27.581 --> 32:30.349
And when you were 17, you...

32:30.351 --> 32:34.921
died... with 4 other kids.

32:34.923 --> 32:37.923
I thought it was a blessing.

32:37.925 --> 32:39.991
I was still here.

32:39.993 --> 32:42.594
I could look out for her.

32:42.596 --> 32:43.962
Watch her.

32:43.964 --> 32:46.465
I didn't mind because
I could be close to her.

32:47.934 --> 32:49.768
Does she know the truth?

32:49.770 --> 32:51.736
I think so.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.940
We don't talk about it.

32:55.942 --> 32:58.042
Bea, I've got four friends marked to die

32:58.044 --> 32:59.710
because of this pact.

32:59.712 --> 33:02.346
I don't know anything about any of that.

33:02.348 --> 33:03.581
You're lying.

33:05.083 --> 33:06.684
You've been here more than 60 years,

33:06.686 --> 33:07.884
I think you know plenty.

33:07.886 --> 33:09.653
You'll ruin everything.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.822
For who, huh?

33:11.824 --> 33:13.256
The pact trades lives for lives...

33:13.258 --> 33:14.324
soldiers for kids.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.391
Who has that kind of power?

33:15.393 --> 33:16.793
You don't want to know.

33:16.795 --> 33:19.362
And you need to stop asking.

33:19.364 --> 33:21.731
Be grateful that you have protection

33:21.733 --> 33:23.866
and find something here that matters.

33:23.868 --> 33:26.368
Bea, please.

33:26.370 --> 33:27.903
Help us break this curse.

33:32.843 --> 33:34.309
You don't want to leave.

33:36.913 --> 33:38.514
You want to stay here with your baby.

33:41.817 --> 33:44.919
But your baby grew up,

33:44.921 --> 33:47.689
and now she's growing old.

33:47.691 --> 33:51.459
And when she dies, she'll move on,

33:51.461 --> 33:53.094
and you'll still be locked here.

33:53.096 --> 33:54.529
You'll be alone.

33:56.764 --> 33:57.965
How will you feel then?

34:20.193 --> 34:21.393
Did you talk to her?

34:24.097 --> 34:25.697
I talked to Olivia this morning.

34:25.699 --> 34:27.331
I just took Rochelle home.

34:31.136 --> 34:32.437
What about Luke?

34:32.438 --> 34:35.739
I didn't bother with that.

34:35.742 --> 34:37.809
He hates me more than the girl.

34:37.811 --> 34:39.344
They don't hate you.

34:39.346 --> 34:41.612
They just don't know you.

34:41.614 --> 34:44.348
And they have no intention
of getting better acquainted.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.849
That's their loss.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.351
They don't see it that way.

34:50.822 --> 34:54.324
They see me as the man trying to get close

34:54.327 --> 34:55.525
to their widowed mother.

34:57.662 --> 35:00.230
Like a villain in a melodrama.

35:00.232 --> 35:02.298
Black suit and all.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.567
I don't think the clients
would appreciate you

35:04.569 --> 35:06.236
in Bermuda shorts.

35:16.146 --> 35:18.280
I saw Springer.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.781
How is he?

35:19.783 --> 35:21.350
Drowning.

35:23.753 --> 35:26.255
He's starting to realize

35:26.257 --> 35:27.489
what he's gotten himself into.

35:29.259 --> 35:30.959
What do you think he'll do?

35:30.961 --> 35:32.627
Something stupid.

35:34.429 --> 35:36.764
Something someone will have to clean up.

35:40.067 --> 35:42.569
No, I'm home now, but I need
you to be ready in case we...

35:45.172 --> 35:46.473
All right, we'll think about it.

35:46.475 --> 35:47.607
I have to go.

35:49.644 --> 35:51.444
Mom. Hi.

35:51.446 --> 35:52.779
Hi.

35:54.415 --> 35:56.582
- Are you okay?
- I'm good. Everything's good.

35:56.584 --> 35:58.517
Where's Luke?

35:58.519 --> 36:01.520
Uh, he's at Remy's, I
just got a text message.

36:01.522 --> 36:02.988
Mr. Beaumont picked him up.

36:04.424 --> 36:06.158
I was gonna go over and get him.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.760
Okay, you do that. I'll start dinner.

36:07.762 --> 36:10.596
That sounds great. When did you get home?

36:10.598 --> 36:12.463
Just a little while
ago. Ray dropped me off.

36:14.166 --> 36:15.833
What were you doing with Mr. Collins?

36:15.835 --> 36:17.234
Olivia go get your brother

36:17.236 --> 36:18.336
and we'll talk about this over dinner.

36:18.338 --> 36:19.504
You can't have anything to do with him.

36:19.506 --> 36:20.805
I'm not talking about this right now.

36:20.807 --> 36:24.141
No, you need to keep him out
of this house, keep him away.

36:24.143 --> 36:28.211
Ray has been nothing but
helpful to our family.

36:28.213 --> 36:30.947
No. He's lying to you.

36:33.017 --> 36:36.252
Olivia, who do you think helped
me find a lawyer so quickly?

36:36.254 --> 36:37.688
Go get your brother, okay?

36:51.635 --> 36:54.370
"If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out."

36:59.475 --> 37:01.008
What did I do?

37:01.010 --> 37:02.677
Dad, are you okay?

37:02.679 --> 37:04.612
I'm fine, baby. I'm fine.

37:04.614 --> 37:06.981
You were sleepwalking
again, you didn't mean to.

37:20.362 --> 37:21.595
Hi.

37:27.268 --> 37:28.969
So you still think this gonna take

37:28.971 --> 37:30.371
six months to fix this place up?

37:30.373 --> 37:32.438
Seven, tops.

37:34.608 --> 37:36.476
And how long if somebody helps you?

37:40.146 --> 37:41.547
Maybe four.

37:41.549 --> 37:42.782
Then what?

37:45.185 --> 37:46.686
Ask me in four months.

37:46.688 --> 37:48.286
Listen, Dad...

37:49.989 --> 37:52.357
(crow cawing)

37:52.359 --> 37:53.458
Huh.

37:53.460 --> 37:55.560
You're a little late, pal.

37:55.562 --> 37:56.728
What do you mean?

37:57.930 --> 38:00.432
"A bird in a house means
a death in the family."

38:01.967 --> 38:03.667
He must have come for old Henry.

38:03.669 --> 38:05.269
I hope so.

38:30.234 --> 38:32.068
Hey.

38:32.070 --> 38:34.637
It's nice night. Just walking?

38:34.639 --> 38:35.771
I'm meeting my brother.

38:35.773 --> 38:37.440
Great, I'll walk with you.

38:37.442 --> 38:39.542
I was outside your house today.

38:39.544 --> 38:41.578
I saw them take away your mom
and your brother. Did you see me?

38:41.580 --> 38:44.279
Yeah. We saw you.

38:44.281 --> 38:47.148
I thought I feel different
after seeing that.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.417
Different?

38:48.419 --> 38:49.784
I don't know. Satisfied.

38:51.254 --> 38:53.555
Satisfied seeing my mom get arrested?

38:53.557 --> 38:55.591
Not arrested. Taken in for questioning.

38:55.593 --> 38:58.460
The arrest comes later.

38:58.462 --> 38:59.827
Good night, Springer.

38:59.829 --> 39:01.596
How come Dillon wasn't there this morning?

39:01.598 --> 39:03.564
Where was your boyfriend in all this?

39:03.566 --> 39:05.833
Did he dump you or something?
I know about your boyfriend.

39:05.835 --> 39:07.768
I know all kinds of stuff about him.

39:07.770 --> 39:10.904
- Are you drunk?
- No, I'm just encouraged.

39:10.906 --> 39:12.673
Do you even know what your boyfriend is?

39:12.675 --> 39:14.642
Stop and listen, this is important,

39:14.644 --> 39:15.775
you should pay attention.

39:15.777 --> 39:17.244
Let go of me.

39:17.246 --> 39:18.878
This whole thing, it's
all your father's fault.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.280
If he'd just done right by my dad,

39:20.282 --> 39:22.515
everything would have
been okay, but he didn't.

39:22.517 --> 39:24.351
- I don't know.
- Shut up and listen.

39:24.353 --> 39:25.785
You got to know why this is happening

39:25.787 --> 39:26.786
and why I did it to you.

39:40.667 --> 39:42.735
Oh, my God. I didn't see him.

40:02.821 --> 40:05.155
I don't know, it just
happened so fast and then...

40:07.124 --> 40:08.158
The two of you were walking together?

40:08.160 --> 40:09.526
No, I told you. He came up to me.

40:09.528 --> 40:10.860
I ran away and he chased me.

40:10.862 --> 40:12.729
What did he do to make you
run away? Did he threaten you?

40:12.731 --> 40:14.598
He grabbed my arm and I ran away from him.

40:19.903 --> 40:21.136
It's been a kind of long day, hasn't it?

40:21.138 --> 40:22.638
Yes, it has.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.072
Well, you wanna make it longer?

40:25.742 --> 40:26.909
Not right now.

40:26.911 --> 40:28.444
Just go home, okay?

40:28.446 --> 40:30.479
I need to talk to Tesa, first.

40:34.484 --> 40:35.650
What happened at Remy's?

40:45.394 --> 40:47.362
Your mother's gonna
meet us at the hospital.

40:47.364 --> 40:48.863
Okay.

40:48.865 --> 40:50.298
- Let me.
- I've got it.

41:04.078 --> 41:06.714
You can't go to a sleep
clinic without your teddy bear.

41:09.316 --> 41:11.250
I'll see you downstairs.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.869
"I sing the body electric."

41:30.871 --> 41:32.904
The armies of those I love engirth me,

41:32.906 --> 41:35.607
and I engirth them.

41:35.609 --> 41:37.776
They will not let me
off till I go with them,

41:37.778 --> 41:39.210
"respond to them."

41:49.388 --> 41:51.021
You know what it is?

41:51.023 --> 41:52.790
Yes.

41:52.792 --> 41:55.692
You know what will happen
to you if you break it?

41:55.694 --> 41:57.226
Yes.

41:57.228 --> 41:58.961
No, you don't.

41:58.963 --> 42:01.464
You only got a taste of it last time.

42:02.533 --> 42:04.734
What about the others trapped like us?

42:04.736 --> 42:08.471
Go away and leave us alone.

42:25.879 --> 42:30.934
