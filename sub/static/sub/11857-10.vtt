WEBVTT

00:09.291 --> 00:11.333
Maybe we should start
without him.

00:11.417 --> 00:13.083
Five more minutes.

00:13.166 --> 00:15.917
(female #1)
'Does Coop even remember
what a church looks like?'

00:16.000 --> 00:18.125
He'll be
here.
Relax.

00:20.750 --> 00:21.750
Hey, you two.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.291
Knock it off.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.750
Talk to your son
this morning, sarge?

00:26.834 --> 00:29.583
Called him an hour
ago.
No answer.

00:29.667 --> 00:31.166
Perfect.

00:40.917 --> 00:44.041
So what do you think, Jimmy?
Brawl or babe?

00:45.041 --> 00:47.083
Brawl...then a babe.

00:47.166 --> 00:48.709
(sarge)
'Isn't it time
he got married?'

00:48.792 --> 00:52.166
Gotta go out on a second
date
for that, sarge.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.250
Okay, what are you
gonna believe?

00:54.333 --> 00:57.250
My alarm broke
or I got lost?

00:57.333 --> 00:58.834
Since you were an altar
boy
here, Sean

00:58.917 --> 01:00.250
I'll go with the former.

01:00.333 --> 01:03.375
There it is.
What Father Mac says.

01:03.458 --> 01:05.792
Lookin' beautiful, Eileen.

01:07.083 --> 01:08.542
Sorry, really.

01:08.625 --> 01:09.917
Forget it, Coop.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.125
Been wondering where
my deputy's been hiding,
eh?

01:13.208 --> 01:15.417
Sweetheart.

01:15.500 --> 01:19.083
So...what are we
waiting for,
partner?

01:21.417 --> 01:24.000
You have asked to have
your child baptized.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.750
In doing so you are accepting

01:25.834 --> 01:27.834
the responsibility
of training him

01:27.917 --> 01:29.959
'in practice
of the faith.'

01:30.041 --> 01:31.667
'It will be
your duty to bring him..'

01:31.750 --> 01:34.000
- Think he'll be a cop?
- 'No choice.'

01:34.083 --> 01:36.500
It's in his genes.
Forever blue.

01:36.583 --> 01:38.542
Someone's gotta break out.

01:38.625 --> 01:40.500
Live a better kind of life.

01:40.583 --> 01:41.834
Yeah?

01:41.917 --> 01:44.959
What else could guys like us
do
for a living?

01:45.041 --> 01:46.917
- Sales?
- Sales.

01:47.000 --> 01:47.959
Yeah, that's it.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.375
Shh.

01:51.250 --> 01:53.000
In the name of the Father

01:53.083 --> 01:54.375
'the Son'

01:54.458 --> 01:56.000
'and the Holy Spirit.'

01:56.083 --> 01:57.750
- Amen.
- 'Amen.'

02:26.542 --> 02:28.709
(man on radio)
'108, are you there?'

02:30.417 --> 02:32.709
'108, are you there?'

03:13.041 --> 03:14.583
(Stillman)
Sev Krol. Aging con.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.500
Says he's got a tip
about a murdered cop

03:16.583 --> 03:18.250
Sean Cooper,
killed in '68.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.417
'68.
You work patrol then,
boss?

03:20.500 --> 03:23.083
First year on the street.
12th District.

03:23.166 --> 03:24.125
So you knew him.

03:24.208 --> 03:25.250
He was ahead of me
at the academy.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.000
Kind of guy you didn't forget.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.417
- How's that?
- Real cowboy.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.000
The kind modern regulations
don't allow anymore.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.583
So what made our con
see the light?

03:34.667 --> 03:36.125
Pancreatic cancer.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.417
- Short timeline?
- Four months to live.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.667
Says he wants to die at home
with his daughter.

03:42.959 --> 03:45.041
Well, hope the tip's good.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.625
Where's my smokes?

03:51.709 --> 03:53.458
Later. What do you got?

03:53.542 --> 03:55.291
(Sev)
'I found him in the car'

03:55.375 --> 03:58.041
before the cops
and everybody got there.

04:00.709 --> 04:02.458
That's it?

04:02.542 --> 04:04.041
Maybe. Maybe not.

04:05.834 --> 04:08.000
Shoe's on the other foot,
ain't it?

04:08.083 --> 04:10.875
Passing away in a prison cell
says it ain't.

04:13.291 --> 04:15.667
Brick of heroin
on the front seat.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.166
(Rush)
'What happened to it?'

04:17.250 --> 04:19.208
What do you think
happened to it?

04:19.291 --> 04:20.792
Finders keepers.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.000
You got no proof.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.208
I saw him lying
there dead..

04:25.375 --> 04:27.250
...radio in his hand..

04:27.333 --> 04:28.583
...eyes wide open.

04:28.667 --> 04:32.375
A black harp stamped
on the brick.

04:32.458 --> 04:34.083
It's Teddy Burke's gang.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.500
Owned the North Philly
heroin trade back then.

04:36.583 --> 04:38.750
Real heavyweight.

04:38.834 --> 04:40.417
You saying Cooper was dirty?

04:40.500 --> 04:42.250
Parked under a bridge

04:42.333 --> 04:45.834
with a whole lotta dope
in the car?

04:45.917 --> 04:48.125
Don't look like a hero,
now, does he?

05:28.250 --> 05:30.792
The box has been up here
as long as I can
remember.

05:30.875 --> 05:33.083
Cop killing.
Doesn't go to storage.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.750
Until it's solved.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.458
(Valens)
'Original theory,
Cooper was killed'

05:36.542 --> 05:38.333
on patrol in a bad neighborhood.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.000
They worked
this thing to death.

05:40.083 --> 05:42.792
Revenge theory, gang hit,
jealous boyfriend.

05:42.875 --> 05:46.041
Apparently Cooper was
quite the ladies' man.

05:46.125 --> 05:47.083
'Went nowhere.'

05:47.166 --> 05:48.875
Well, beat up drug dealers too.

05:48.959 --> 05:51.000
(Stillman)
'In the old ways.
Knocking heads, taking money.'

05:51.083 --> 05:53.208
It was different back then.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.458
(Rush)
'And his partner?'

05:56.542 --> 05:59.750
Jimmy Bruno.
Off training a rookie.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.583
The force was really
short staffed then.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.834
That's why there were
incentives for returning
vets

06:03.917 --> 06:05.417
to go to the academy.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.917
Like yours truly.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.750
And Cooper.

06:09.834 --> 06:11.917
First on the
scene
was Owen Murphy.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.709
Could have known
Cooper was on the
take.

06:13.792 --> 06:16.000
- Covered it up.
- 'Start there.'

06:19.583 --> 06:21.875
Coop's father.
Gave him the heads-up.

06:24.792 --> 06:28.792
You're accusing my son
of being involved in drugs?

06:28.875 --> 06:31.041
Why don't we step
into my office?

06:37.792 --> 06:39.333
The investigation's
just started, sarge.

06:39.417 --> 06:41.959
Investigation?
It's a disgrace.

06:42.041 --> 06:43.208
You want me
to solve the
job

06:43.291 --> 06:44.792
or just let it
keep
collecting
dust?

06:44.875 --> 06:46.625
My son had a reputation.

06:46.709 --> 06:48.792
That's all a cop has.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.291
- Do not dishonor his good
name.
- That's not my intention.

06:51.375 --> 06:53.583
Cops didn't do that
in the old days

06:53.667 --> 06:55.583
not when you came on the force.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.625
The department
has changed a
lot.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.834
Have you changed, lieutenant?

07:07.750 --> 07:09.917
So you were the first car
on the scene.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.333
Found Sean Cooper's body.

07:11.417 --> 07:12.709
Is she your girlfriend?

07:12.792 --> 07:14.291
What do you know
about Teddy Burke?

07:14.375 --> 07:17.250
Well, everybody knew that Burke
was a big-time dealer.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.834
- Your point?
- Was Cooper shaking him down?

07:19.917 --> 07:21.125
Cooper?

07:21.208 --> 07:22.333
You're kiddin', right?

07:22.417 --> 07:24.709
Taking Burke's
heroin,
sellin' it?

07:24.792 --> 07:27.834
Cooper hated Burke.
He came down on him real hard.

07:27.917 --> 07:30.500
Busting him with a lot of
noise?
Best cover ever.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.667
Oh, no. Not Coop.
You should have seen this guy.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.041
He played
by his own
rules?

07:35.125 --> 07:36.792
Well, let's just say
that he didn't shy away

07:36.875 --> 07:38.166
from confrontation.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.917
- How's that?
- Cooper was all about the
law.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.291
There's no way he got corrupted.

08:10.458 --> 08:13.333
Now, what is a fine-lookin'
lady like you

08:13.417 --> 08:16.500
doin' in a dump
like this?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.041
They always run away from me.

08:18.125 --> 08:20.875
Well, maybe
it's your shiny
personality.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.041
What are you doin'?

08:22.125 --> 08:23.083
Sellin' ice cream.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.250
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:24.333 --> 08:25.417
What are you doin'?

08:25.500 --> 08:27.417
Hah. Let me see.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.208
Argh!
You son of a bitch!

08:29.291 --> 08:30.542
Don't you know
who I am?

08:30.625 --> 08:32.417
A drug dealer
in an ugly leather
jacket?

08:32.500 --> 08:33.750
Am I getting close?

08:33.834 --> 08:34.959
You're makin' a big mistake.

08:35.041 --> 08:36.458
Shut up.

08:38.792 --> 08:39.834
Whoa!

08:45.500 --> 08:48.875
There's ways to get a piece,
officer. That ain't one.

08:48.959 --> 08:50.250
Cuff him, Jimmy.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.417
This won't stick.
Why you bringing me in?

08:53.500 --> 08:56.583
It's your jacket.
Clashes with the neighborhood.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.041
Urban blight, Burke.

08:58.125 --> 09:00.166
It's in all the papers.

09:00.250 --> 09:01.709
Mark my words.

09:01.792 --> 09:05.291
I'm gonna last a lot longer
on these streets than you.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.875
- Oh!
- Watch your head.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.667
And this run-in
just slipped your
mind

09:16.750 --> 09:19.583
when Coop ends up dead
a few months later?

09:19.667 --> 09:22.291
I had my own reasons
for keeping mum.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.458
So you were dirty, too.

09:27.041 --> 09:28.625
You a lesbian?

09:28.709 --> 09:29.792
You a jackass?

09:29.875 --> 09:31.458
Well, two girls,
now that's..

09:31.542 --> 09:34.834
- That's hot.
- Watch your tone, Murphy.

09:34.917 --> 09:37.125
- Yeah, whatever.
- Get out of here.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.959
That guy must get
laid
all the time.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.834
He's old school.
Not used to females on the
job.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.166
- Uh-huh.
- Anyway.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.917
Jimmy was there
when it hit the fan with
Burke.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.125
So why didn't
he report it?

09:56.625 --> 09:58.000
I didn't know you played.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.542
I don't.
Belongs to a kid in my
building.

10:00.625 --> 10:01.917
Stole it from him.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.834
- You've lost it.
- 'No, I've gained it.'

10:03.917 --> 10:05.709
- Gained what?
- The upper hand.

10:05.792 --> 10:08.041
- Over a kid?
- He's out to get me.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.834
'Plays morning, noon and night
right outside my window.'

10:10.917 --> 10:13.000
I can't sleep.
I can't think.

10:13.083 --> 10:16.250
It's-it's like all
he has
is this ball.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.625
And you took it
away from him.

10:20.125 --> 10:21.458
Quit lookin' at me like that.

10:21.542 --> 10:25.583
You know the police shrink's
two floors down, right?

10:25.667 --> 10:27.542
I lost it. Haven't I?

10:27.625 --> 10:28.709
You're close.

10:28.792 --> 10:31.917
Well...at least I
won
this round.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.667
Why'd you think
your partner was
killed?

10:43.291 --> 10:45.375
He was fearless.

10:45.458 --> 10:48.875
Used to go looking for bad
guys
in North Philly.

10:48.959 --> 10:51.542
I always figured
one of them finally got
revenge.

10:51.625 --> 10:54.625
Tell us
about Teddy Burke, Jimmy.

10:54.709 --> 10:58.125
Well, he sure hated Coop,
I can tell you that.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.709
Never made it
into the box.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.000
- Were you protecting Burke?
- No.

11:02.083 --> 11:04.166
Guy was in Atlantic City
that night.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.000
I checked it personally.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.709
And still no mention in the box.

11:08.792 --> 11:11.834
'Cause mentioning Burke
would've cost me my job.

11:11.917 --> 11:14.583
- Why's that, Jimmy?
- 'Burke had a lot of money.'

11:14.667 --> 11:15.875
Connections.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.750
Didn't make sense
to get his name involved.

11:17.834 --> 11:19.291
Well, what did he
spend
his money on?

11:19.375 --> 11:21.333
Making sure
he stayed out of jail.

11:21.417 --> 11:23.583
He pay off cops?

11:23.667 --> 11:25.583
It was '68.

11:25.667 --> 11:26.834
Money was around.

11:26.917 --> 11:27.834
How'd it run?

11:27.917 --> 11:30.375
All the way to the top.

11:35.375 --> 11:37.125
Eileen home tonight?

11:37.208 --> 11:38.667
You in love with my wife, Coop?

11:38.750 --> 11:41.041
Yeah, just her cooking.

11:41.125 --> 11:43.250
She's taking the kids
to "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."

11:43.333 --> 11:44.583
Oh, too bad.

11:44.667 --> 11:47.083
Means we gotta drink
and watch TV all night

11:47.166 --> 11:48.083
with no one naggin' us.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.709
- Damn shame.
- Hmm.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.792
No, you many not use
the ladies' room.

11:52.875 --> 11:55.125
We're allowed to beat up queers
for information right, Jimmy?

11:55.208 --> 11:56.542
Your bust, your call.

11:58.709 --> 11:59.959
Inside.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.667
Am I on LSD or is that
Teddy Burke out there?

12:11.750 --> 12:12.959
Oh, you take LSD, boss?

12:13.041 --> 12:15.792
Oh, damn it, Cooper,
save the wise-ass remarks.

12:15.875 --> 12:17.542
Why'd you guys bring him in?

12:17.625 --> 12:19.041
He was selling smack
on a corner.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.875
And which one of you
came to me for the okay?

12:22.375 --> 12:24.792
- We gotta get permission?
- Oh, don't play dumb.

12:24.875 --> 12:26.834
Lieutenant,
correct me if I'm wrong

12:26.917 --> 12:28.417
but doesn't the Crimes Code say

12:28.500 --> 12:30.709
"the possession
of drugs is illegal?"

12:33.125 --> 12:35.834
Are you gonna get this jackass
under control?

12:37.750 --> 12:39.125
I'll make sure
we get proper
clearance

12:39.208 --> 12:40.667
on all politically
sensitive suspects.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.250
Screw that.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.500
Jimmy and I've been
together a year.

12:44.583 --> 12:47.083
We've had more busts,
seen more convictions

12:47.166 --> 12:48.458
than any other team.

12:48.542 --> 12:50.625
Your point?

12:50.709 --> 12:53.792
Point is, captain
appreciates
our work.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.166
You think he knows

12:56.250 --> 12:58.709
you're such good
pals
with Teddy Burke?

13:00.417 --> 13:02.834
Do not try
and go over my head, Cooper.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.208
You'll regret it.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.917
Now scram.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.834
What about Burke?

13:11.917 --> 13:13.792
Oh, Teddy Burke?

13:13.875 --> 13:15.667
Was he busted today?

13:38.542 --> 13:40.917
McCree was taking
protection money from Burke

13:41.000 --> 13:42.834
and spreadin' it around.

13:42.917 --> 13:44.500
Except for Coop.

13:44.583 --> 13:46.291
Were you on the payroll?

13:46.375 --> 13:48.542
You know how it was
back then, John. How 'bout you?

13:48.625 --> 13:52.208
You take a little money
in those days?

13:53.625 --> 13:56.834
12th District had its own rules.

13:56.917 --> 13:59.583
What was Coop doing
under that bridge,
Jimmy?

13:59.667 --> 14:00.834
Night he was killed?

14:00.917 --> 14:04.125
Responding to a dispatch.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.917
No record of that dispatch
on his patrol log.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.041
Who sent him out there?

14:08.125 --> 14:10.458
Radio room sent
all the dispatches.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.041
Manned by cops.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.291
A lot of cops owed McCree.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.166
McCree needed to get Coop
under control

14:19.250 --> 14:22.375
so maybe he was set up?

14:22.458 --> 14:24.542
By his own lieutenant.

14:33.792 --> 14:36.291
I got Kat and Nick looking
for the dispatch card.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.083
Could be in
the old radio room.

14:38.166 --> 14:39.750
Or city records.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.000
Good to see you, Tom.

14:46.083 --> 14:47.750
Anything for the troops.

14:47.834 --> 14:48.792
What's up?

14:48.875 --> 14:50.542
You remember Teddy Burke?

14:50.625 --> 14:51.583
Yeah, vaguely.

14:51.667 --> 14:53.000
Ever arrest him?

14:53.083 --> 14:54.417
You know old age.

14:54.500 --> 14:58.375
Handicap, and your memory,
they go right in the crapper.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.125
He ran the heroin
trade
out of your district

15:00.208 --> 15:01.166
and never got locked up.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.875
That's a lot of luck.

15:02.959 --> 15:05.458
I mean, you get rid
of one scumbag like Burke

15:05.542 --> 15:08.458
and another pops up
to take his place.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.291
You might as well
tax 'em, huh?

15:10.375 --> 15:11.625
You take care of your men.

15:11.709 --> 15:12.792
Damn right I did.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.166
That's how we did it
back in the day.

15:14.250 --> 15:15.583
You remember.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.625
How'd you take care of Coop?

15:17.709 --> 15:19.208
And your meaning, hotshot?

15:19.291 --> 15:21.083
(Stillman)
'Cooper was responding
to a dispatch'

15:21.166 --> 15:22.166
'the night he was shot.'

15:22.250 --> 15:23.166
Says who?

15:23.250 --> 15:26.000
We're asking the questions, Tom.

15:26.083 --> 15:27.667
Well, you heard a lie.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.875
And you know the truth?

15:32.625 --> 15:35.417
He was a real playboy type,
Cooper.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.166
So between us..

15:37.250 --> 15:38.667
...I ain't surprised
he got shot.

15:38.750 --> 15:40.041
Jealous boyfriend?

15:40.125 --> 15:41.375
Husband.

15:41.458 --> 15:45.458
'Cause that is the one woman
you cannot touch..

15:45.542 --> 15:46.750
...ever.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.792
I know it's wrong.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.041
How could you do
this to me, Coop?

16:00.125 --> 16:02.959
- To us?
- What do you want from me?

16:10.333 --> 16:12.500
Looky, what we got here.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.000
Give it a rest.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.333
How long has it been going on?

16:20.875 --> 16:22.333
Jimmy know?

16:24.291 --> 16:25.542
No.

16:26.375 --> 16:27.834
What would your old man say?

16:27.917 --> 16:29.417
His own son bangin'
another cop's wife.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.625
You leave sarge out of this.

16:30.709 --> 16:32.875
Oh, you don't tell
me
what to do.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.458
Not ever again.

16:36.542 --> 16:38.834
I don't give a rat's
ass
about you.

16:38.917 --> 16:42.375
But Jimmy's a good man.
He doesn't deserve this.

16:42.458 --> 16:44.583
You end it, understand?

16:46.583 --> 16:48.375
Yeah. I understand.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.917
This is a cop's wife.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.750
You crossed a line.

16:54.834 --> 16:57.000
- I know that.
- You better.

17:03.917 --> 17:06.917
Cooper was having an affair
with his partner's wife?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.750
Self-righteous jackass.

17:08.834 --> 17:11.417
Eileen couldn't have been too
happy about him breaking it
off.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.500
Well, married woman cast off
by the young womanizer.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.750
Had to leave a bitter taste.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.875
Payback's a bitch, huh?

17:19.667 --> 17:21.750
Maybe she told Jimmy?

17:29.542 --> 17:31.000
This nurse..

17:31.083 --> 17:32.125
...says she's looking for you.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.875
- For me?
- You know her?

17:34.959 --> 17:36.250
(Vera)
'No.'

17:38.542 --> 17:41.417
- How do I look?
- Like crap.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.542
Can't keep 'em off me.

17:49.709 --> 17:50.750
Why, hello.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.333
You stole
my son's
basketball

17:52.417 --> 17:55.333
and I want it back.

17:55.417 --> 17:57.542
Lady, I'm getting
sleep deprivation

17:57.625 --> 17:58.667
'cause of your
kid
and that ball.

17:58.750 --> 17:59.875
So you're admitting
you took it?

17:59.959 --> 18:01.542
Didn't say that.

18:01.625 --> 18:03.542
I just got off
a double shift, you hear me?

18:03.625 --> 18:07.000
I do not have time
for your brand of BS.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.417
Officer, I want to report
a robbery.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.208
- Well, we're, uh, Homicide.
- Take this down.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.834
Suspect is a white man
wearin' an ugly-assed tie

18:14.917 --> 18:16.166
and a bad attitude.

18:16.250 --> 18:17.583
Well, maybe if
you
were home more

18:17.667 --> 18:20.166
he wouldn't be
clanging
that ball all night.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.458
Excuse me?

18:21.542 --> 18:24.208
Did I ask your opinion
about my mothering skills?

18:24.291 --> 18:26.959
Don't have to.
Proof is in the pudding,
lady.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.166
If my child needed a father

18:28.250 --> 18:30.375
you would be
the last man on Earth.

18:30.458 --> 18:32.166
Yeah, well,
if I wanted a
child

18:32.250 --> 18:34.583
your son would be
the last kid on
Earth.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.083
Stay away
from my boy, you hear?

18:39.166 --> 18:40.834
And while you're at it..

18:40.917 --> 18:42.375
...grow up.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.083
You really do have
a way with the
nurses.

18:55.041 --> 18:56.709
Coop was handsome.

18:56.792 --> 18:59.125
Brave...back from the war.

18:59.208 --> 19:01.667
By all accounts,
an exciting guy.

19:03.291 --> 19:04.875
I suppose he was, yes.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.792
Now you were married,
with kids.

19:06.875 --> 19:10.083
Maybe looking for
some excitement
yourself?

19:10.166 --> 19:12.834
You think I was having
an affair with Coop?

19:12.917 --> 19:14.709
It seems like he was
around the house a lot.

19:14.792 --> 19:17.542
Maybe he stopped by once
when Jimmy wasn't there.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.333
You don't know
what you're talking about.

19:19.417 --> 19:21.667
Were you angry
when Coop broke it off?

19:21.750 --> 19:24.208
Last bit of romance
goes out of your life.

19:24.291 --> 19:26.542
- Breaks your heart.
- It wasn't like that.

19:26.625 --> 19:29.041
What was it like, Eileen?

19:30.542 --> 19:33.041
You two, you're both so young.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.583
So certain.

19:35.834 --> 19:37.750
My heart got broke, yes.

19:37.834 --> 19:39.917
But not how you think.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.583
(Jimmy)
'Why you gotta piss off
Teddy Burke like that?'

19:45.667 --> 19:47.458
(Sean)
'Are you afraid
of that scumbag?'

19:47.542 --> 19:50.542
(Jimmy)
'It ain't about fear.
You know what it's about.'

19:50.625 --> 19:53.417
- 'What's it about, Jimmy?'
- 'Keeping my job.'

19:53.500 --> 19:56.125
I ain't goin'
against McCree.

19:56.208 --> 19:59.333
So that makes it alright
to be on the take?

19:59.417 --> 20:01.041
Hmm?

20:01.125 --> 20:03.709
Everything's always
black and white with you.

20:03.792 --> 20:06.417
- You don't know anything.
- We're cops.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.625
That's all
I need to
know.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.125
I got three kids.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.458
Don't talk to me about taking

20:13.542 --> 20:15.625
50 bucks a week
from a piece of crap.

20:15.709 --> 20:19.417
- Then you are just like
McCree.
- Get off your soapbox, Coop.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.625
You go out there
and you bust shins

20:20.709 --> 20:22.542
'cause it's another
good time for you.

20:22.625 --> 20:25.625
I bust shins because
I am enforcing the law.

20:25.709 --> 20:28.208
- You and your John Wayne act.
- We're the law.

20:28.291 --> 20:30.125
We're here
to put the scumbags
away.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.125
- It ain't fun and games.
- Sure it is.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.667
Just like the fun you had
slaughtering Vietcong.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.959
You miss that free pass
to kill, don't you?

20:37.041 --> 20:38.375
Ah!

20:40.041 --> 20:43.166
- You're right. That was fun.
- Go to hell.

21:20.875 --> 21:23.000
(Rush)
'I see what you mean.'

21:26.417 --> 21:29.834
Thanks for your time, Eileen.

21:29.917 --> 21:32.667
(Rush)
Two guys on the force
having a love affair?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.291
Serious trouble back then.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.709
Well, how about today?

21:44.875 --> 21:47.375
Two male cops hittin' it.
Whoa.

21:47.458 --> 21:49.125
Recipe for disaster.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.125
Remember Ray Walsh,
worked Narcotics?

21:51.208 --> 21:53.792
Yeah, big Sixers' fan,
retired
to Vegas. What about him?

21:53.875 --> 21:55.834
I heard he's living with a guy.

21:55.917 --> 21:57.875
So what?

21:57.959 --> 22:00.375
Ray Walsh took me
to a couple of Sixers' games.

22:01.959 --> 22:03.417
Took you?

22:04.500 --> 22:06.542
Tickets were free, uh..

22:06.625 --> 22:08.750
...that doesn't mean anything.

22:10.166 --> 22:11.542
Live and let live.

22:11.625 --> 22:14.750
And, "Don't ask, don't tell"
works just fine today, too.

22:19.166 --> 22:20.417
Jimmy, we all want to find out

22:20.500 --> 22:22.125
what happened to Coop
that night, right?

22:22.208 --> 22:23.917
Of course.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.583
Well, you know how it is,
we investigate the victim

22:26.667 --> 22:28.834
find out everything about him.

22:30.125 --> 22:31.917
Guys, I was on the
force
for 25 years.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.834
What, you giving me
a rookie test here?

22:33.917 --> 22:35.000
Well..

22:35.083 --> 22:36.709
...we had a long
talk with Eileen.

22:36.792 --> 22:39.750
Said your marriage finally
broke up 'cause, uh, you
know..

22:39.834 --> 22:42.667
[clears throat]
...the way you and Coop were.

22:43.917 --> 22:46.041
She saw you
in the backyard, Jimmy.

22:52.583 --> 22:55.125
Eileen's still
bitter
about the
divorce.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.083
Jimmy, I just wanna find out
who killed your partner.

22:57.166 --> 23:00.041
Well, you got
the wrong info on us.

23:00.125 --> 23:02.417
Maybe someone else
got the wrong impression, too.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.208
I wouldn't know.

23:10.041 --> 23:12.125
Jimmy, Coop was your partner.

23:13.291 --> 23:15.542
You owe him.

23:26.750 --> 23:28.125
So I'm pulling
this little queer

23:28.208 --> 23:29.625
out of that bathhouse
on Monroe Street

23:29.709 --> 23:33.041
and he's crying,
"Don't tell my wife." Waah!

23:35.583 --> 23:37.000
You must have took
a little in the backdoor

23:37.083 --> 23:38.500
in Nam, huh, Coop?

23:38.583 --> 23:40.875
'All those
lonely jungle nights.'

23:40.959 --> 23:41.875
Right.

23:41.959 --> 23:43.583
See, he agrees.

23:43.667 --> 23:45.375
Didn't know you played
on their team.

23:45.458 --> 23:46.500
Shut up, Murph.

23:46.583 --> 23:48.333
(Murphy)
'Oh, you too, Jimmy?'

23:48.417 --> 23:49.667
'You a fairy queen or what?'

23:49.750 --> 23:51.333
Give it a rest, man.

23:51.417 --> 23:52.792
Oh, I get it.

23:52.875 --> 23:55.166
Jimmy and Coop,
the dynamic duo.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.375
You know, they say Batman
and Robin are homos.

24:00.959 --> 24:02.834
What if I was?

24:02.917 --> 24:05.041
- Was what?
- A homo.

24:05.125 --> 24:06.375
A queer.

24:06.458 --> 24:07.583
Coop, easy.

24:07.667 --> 24:09.667
You want too, Murphy? Huh?

24:09.750 --> 24:11.875
That your problem, fairy boy?

24:13.625 --> 24:15.667
Get off of me!

24:17.750 --> 24:19.750
I ain't no queer.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.959
You get that straight.

24:32.125 --> 24:35.875
To a guy like Murphy,
those were fighting
words.

24:35.959 --> 24:38.208
Then, he was first on the scene.

24:40.041 --> 24:42.166
Thanks for your time, Jimmy.

24:51.959 --> 24:55.709
Coop wasn't...like that.

24:55.792 --> 24:57.917
Whatever you want to call it.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.458
Sure, Jimmy.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.166
Neither was I.

25:11.750 --> 25:14.417
Heard you got a problem with
pansies on the force, Owen.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.792
What's she babbling about?

25:15.875 --> 25:20.000
When I ask you a question,
you answer it. Understand?

25:20.083 --> 25:22.291
Or you can spend some time
down in lock-up.

25:22.375 --> 25:23.917
Your choice.

25:25.667 --> 25:28.208
We know Coop humiliated you
in front of your boys.

25:28.291 --> 25:30.083
Maybe you got even
under that bridge.

25:30.166 --> 25:32.458
The guy was a freak, okay?

25:33.417 --> 25:35.417
But kill another cop...no way.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.458
We're not just gonna
take your word.

25:37.542 --> 25:39.625
Doesn't work like that.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.542
Coop should've just let it go.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.208
Let what go?

25:47.041 --> 25:49.166
What he and Jimmy were doing.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.834
Thing like that can kill you.

25:57.375 --> 25:59.959
I can't go on like this, Jimmy.

26:00.041 --> 26:01.166
Like what?

26:01.250 --> 26:02.667
You know what I mean.

26:02.750 --> 26:06.166
Making plans day to day, not
knowing when I'm gonna see you.

26:06.250 --> 26:08.333
You see me every day.

26:08.417 --> 26:10.500
That's not what I mean.

26:11.709 --> 26:13.917
Then say what you mean.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.458
We got somethin' here

26:18.542 --> 26:20.583
and it ain't goin' away.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.834
I got a family.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.500
You think Eileen wants
to be married to a stranger?

26:26.583 --> 26:29.000
You think if she knew,
she'd want to keep living a
lie?

26:29.083 --> 26:31.291
I ain't leaving my kids, Coop.

26:32.667 --> 26:34.166
Not asking for that.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.709
What then?

26:37.250 --> 26:39.333
Remember what you were
talking about?

26:39.417 --> 26:42.500
Livin' a different kind of
life?
This is our shot.

26:42.583 --> 26:44.000
That was just talk.

26:44.083 --> 26:46.250
We're cursed with this thing.

26:52.083 --> 26:53.542
My folks..

26:53.625 --> 26:55.834
...been married forever, right?

26:55.917 --> 26:58.834
But whatever they had,
died years ago.

26:58.917 --> 27:01.625
And I look around
and I see everyone like that.

27:01.709 --> 27:04.333
Stayin' together
'cause of the church

27:04.417 --> 27:05.834
or 'cause it's expected

27:05.917 --> 27:08.458
or 'cause they got
nowhere else to go.

27:08.542 --> 27:09.917
Cursed?

27:13.166 --> 27:15.291
We're the lucky ones, Jimmy.

27:20.583 --> 27:22.166
I don't know.

27:24.542 --> 27:26.583
You sure about that?

27:34.834 --> 27:37.166
Guess I don't got a choice.

27:55.625 --> 27:57.583
(Jeffries)
'You think to share this
with anyone else?'

27:57.667 --> 28:00.041
Well, I told his dad, sarge.

28:00.125 --> 28:02.625
'He's the only person
that Coop would ever listen
to.'

28:02.709 --> 28:04.792
- When was this?
- After the christening.

28:04.875 --> 28:07.125
I figured sarge would
sort him out.

28:27.125 --> 28:29.375
[sighs]
I don't believe
this.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.959
- Peace offering.
- I don't want it.

28:32.041 --> 28:34.709
Looked like you were
having a bad day.

28:34.792 --> 28:35.750
I wasn't helping.

28:35.834 --> 28:38.458
Serious understatement.

28:38.542 --> 28:41.959
I don't...think I can
fit this through.

28:48.208 --> 28:49.625
You know we're
on the same team, right?

28:49.709 --> 28:50.917
What team is that?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.583
Cops, nurses makin' the world
a better place

28:53.667 --> 28:56.041
while getting paid nothing.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.667
That's deep.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.208
Really.

29:03.959 --> 29:05.208
Andre.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.333
What do you say, Andre?

29:12.417 --> 29:15.917
He didn't have
to buy you a new ball.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.917
Thank you, kind sir.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.041
Have a pleasant day.

29:23.875 --> 29:26.166
Sorry, teenage boys.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.667
He's a Martian to me.

29:28.750 --> 29:30.250
Wasn't any different
when I was his age

29:30.333 --> 29:31.792
and look how I turned out.

29:31.875 --> 29:33.667
Yeah. I see.

29:44.208 --> 29:46.625
McCree lied about
no dispatch card.

29:46.709 --> 29:48.250
Found in the radio room files.

29:48.333 --> 29:49.750
So a dispatch
definitely went out?

29:49.834 --> 29:51.750
Yep, and written on every card?

29:51.834 --> 29:54.083
Badge number of
who sent out the
call.

29:54.166 --> 29:56.834
- I ID'd the number.
- And?

29:56.917 --> 29:59.000
Belonged to Coop's father.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.166
Sarge?

30:01.250 --> 30:02.709
None other.

30:04.625 --> 30:06.959
So he sent his own son
to his death?

30:15.250 --> 30:18.583
You come to me...diggin' up
old skeletons, tellin' lies.

30:18.667 --> 30:20.959
We know about Coop
and Jimmy, sarge.

30:21.041 --> 30:23.709
- You knew, too.
- Tough thing to abide.

30:23.792 --> 30:26.333
My boy was a ladies' man.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.291
Picked 'em like cherries.

30:29.375 --> 30:31.834
You working the radio room
the night your son was
killed?

30:31.917 --> 30:33.166
Nah.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.083
That your badge number?

30:42.917 --> 30:44.959
You sent Coop to the bridge.

30:45.041 --> 30:47.166
Didn't you?

30:47.250 --> 30:49.542
I didn't kill my boy.

30:51.875 --> 30:54.083
I loved him..

30:54.166 --> 30:56.625
...from the day he was born.

30:56.709 --> 31:00.917
He came out with his
fists
clenched like this.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.083
He was a man,
not...not
that..

31:05.166 --> 31:07.583
Of course not.
Never that.

31:07.667 --> 31:10.375
We had a
reputation,
him and me.

31:10.458 --> 31:12.875
Cop's reputation is all he has.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.500
Coop was gonna destroy all that.

31:23.750 --> 31:24.959
You won't believe
the load of crap

31:25.041 --> 31:27.166
that Owen Murphy just told me.

31:28.375 --> 31:29.709
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:29.792 --> 31:33.667
He...he said that, uh,
that you and Jimmy are,
uh..

31:42.041 --> 31:44.041
Yeah, forget about it.
It ain't worth
discussing.

31:45.417 --> 31:46.625
Sure.

31:46.709 --> 31:49.166
He's crazy.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.709
Right, son?

31:59.583 --> 32:01.834
You really wanna talk
about this, pop?

32:12.291 --> 32:14.417
You need to find a new partner.

32:16.166 --> 32:17.500
Jimmy is good.

32:17.583 --> 32:20.166
Jimmy Bruno is a sick,
disgusting son of a
bitch.

32:20.250 --> 32:23.583
- No, he's not.
- You were led astray.

32:23.667 --> 32:25.083
No one leads me.

32:25.166 --> 32:27.333
You of all people
know that, pop.

32:27.417 --> 32:29.709
You're my son.

32:29.792 --> 32:32.417
You can't..

32:32.500 --> 32:34.583
...you can't be a..

32:40.750 --> 32:42.041
We raised you right.

32:42.125 --> 32:44.208
It has nothing to do with you.

32:44.291 --> 32:49.667
You are not going to disgrace
our family, the force.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.417
Quit lookin' at me
like that, pop.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.750
Please.

32:54.709 --> 32:56.333
I thought you were a man.

32:56.417 --> 32:59.875
- I am.
- 'No, you're not.'

32:59.959 --> 33:02.166
And you're not my son neither.

33:10.625 --> 33:12.875
I didn't know what I was sayin'.

33:14.208 --> 33:18.000
Talk about the dispatch, sarge.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.583
McCree told me to-to send him
to the bridge.

33:23.291 --> 33:24.750
McCree knew?

33:24.834 --> 33:27.250
I told him.

33:27.333 --> 33:29.875
I thought they were gonna
send some guys to rough him up.

33:33.792 --> 33:36.834
Then I heard Coop was dead.

33:36.917 --> 33:39.875
You wanna tell us the real
reason Jimmy wasn't with him?

33:39.959 --> 33:44.208
The two did never split up,
not on the job.

33:44.291 --> 33:47.917
It didn't...never added up.

33:56.667 --> 33:59.250
I don't care what Coop was.

33:59.333 --> 34:00.792
Not anymore.

34:02.875 --> 34:05.125
I just want my boy back.

34:16.542 --> 34:18.625
I don't know what I would
have
done in your shoes, Tommy.

34:18.709 --> 34:21.500
I mean you can't have those
types around the precinct.

34:21.583 --> 34:22.625
Time was we had standards.

34:22.709 --> 34:24.542
We did. And they were upheld.

34:24.625 --> 34:25.959
See, you understand, John.

34:26.041 --> 34:27.500
By the lieutenant.

34:27.583 --> 34:28.750
Not a job for the weak.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.083
No, you see weak lieutenants
all the time.

34:31.166 --> 34:32.792
They can't handle problems
by themselves.

34:32.875 --> 34:34.959
They're afraid of, uh..

34:35.041 --> 34:36.375
...discipline.

34:36.458 --> 34:39.583
So what about the guys
you sent to do Coop and Jimmy?

34:39.667 --> 34:41.375
What do you mean?

34:41.458 --> 34:45.041
[chuckling]
All due respect, Tommy.
Wasn't discipline.

34:45.125 --> 34:48.125
Guys went to scare them,
they end up shooting Coop.

34:48.208 --> 34:50.333
That's the definition of a mess.

34:50.417 --> 34:51.834
I was trainin' a rookie cop

34:51.917 --> 34:53.500
that's why I wasn't with him
that night.

34:53.583 --> 34:56.333
- 'That the real reason,
Jimmy?'
- I told you a million times.

34:56.417 --> 34:58.583
Look, sarge knew
about you and Coop.

34:59.917 --> 35:01.458
He told your lieutenant.

35:01.542 --> 35:04.458
That's why Coop was sent out
to the bridge that night.

35:06.583 --> 35:08.208
Truth time, Jimmy.

35:09.458 --> 35:11.500
You owe him that.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.250
If I'd been with
him
in the car that
night..

35:18.333 --> 35:19.458
...he'd have had a chance.

35:19.542 --> 35:22.667
But you let him go out
on his own.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.041
Why?

35:27.709 --> 35:31.375
Because if I got in that car

35:31.458 --> 35:34.875
the whole world
was gonna know.

35:34.959 --> 35:36.417
Know what?

35:38.542 --> 35:40.333
Know what, Jimmy?

35:43.291 --> 35:44.959
Who I was.

35:46.583 --> 35:49.375
In a strong precinct that
never
would have happened, Tommy.

35:49.458 --> 35:51.500
Undisciplined cops not
following
the lieutenant's orders--

35:51.583 --> 35:54.208
I didn't have undisciplined
cops. My men followed
orders.

35:54.291 --> 35:55.792
Not on the night
that Coop was killed.

35:55.875 --> 35:58.291
Coop! There's no word
for what he was.

35:58.375 --> 35:59.542
And why do you care?

35:59.625 --> 36:01.166
- He was a cop.
- He was a joke!

36:01.250 --> 36:03.000
His type wasn't natural.
He wasn't right--

36:03.083 --> 36:04.875
- You had to clean house.
- You damn right I did!

36:04.959 --> 36:06.792
- So what'd you do?
- I shot that queer.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.917
And I'd do it again!

36:15.542 --> 36:19.041
The world back then
didn't understand.

36:19.125 --> 36:21.583
You believed it was wrong.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.250
But that kind of thing..

36:23.333 --> 36:24.583
...comes around once
in a lifetime

36:24.667 --> 36:27.250
and you, and you gotta hold on
or you'll lose it.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.583
Coop was right.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.083
You were the lucky ones, Jimmy.

36:39.041 --> 36:41.291
I miss him.

36:41.375 --> 36:43.041
I know.

36:57.208 --> 36:59.542
You two stick close
in North Philly tonight.

36:59.625 --> 37:02.625
Been getting armed robbery
calls
from under the bridge.

37:02.709 --> 37:03.959
Send the bad guys.

37:04.041 --> 37:06.166
I'll try and scare
some up for you.

37:11.709 --> 37:14.083
Keep an eye
on those bathhouses, Jimmy.

37:27.709 --> 37:29.417
You gettin' in or what?

37:29.500 --> 37:31.667
I think I'm gonna take
out
a rookie.

37:34.083 --> 37:36.125
- Serious?
- Yeah.

37:38.250 --> 37:40.458
I'll pick up some beer.
I'll meet you after.

37:41.583 --> 37:43.667
I can't make it tonight.

37:45.792 --> 37:47.208
Why not?

37:51.291 --> 37:54.041
Maybe it's time for a change.

37:54.125 --> 37:55.667
What kinda change?

37:58.083 --> 38:00.917
I wasn't thinking
right
when we talked.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.917
And I haven't been
right
for a long time.

38:06.083 --> 38:08.250
What's goin' on, Jimmy?

38:11.125 --> 38:13.458
I'm not gonna be making it
over to your place no more.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.166
You should get a new partner.

38:18.583 --> 38:20.000
You afraid?

38:22.125 --> 38:24.125
It's got nothin'
to do with that.

38:24.208 --> 38:25.709
I'm afraid, too.

38:25.792 --> 38:28.792
Look, I gotta get goin'.

38:28.875 --> 38:29.875
Jimmy.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.583
Don't go. Please.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.667
We're the lucky ones, remember?

38:48.333 --> 38:50.542
I think you got it wrong there.

38:51.959 --> 38:54.041
I ain't a queer.

39:07.625 --> 39:08.875
Coop!

39:23.000 --> 39:25.709
(man on radio)
'Need a unit at the east end
and Diamond.'

39:25.792 --> 39:28.458
'Report of a robbery.
Suspect last seen on foot.'

39:28.542 --> 39:31.250
(Coop on radio)
'Cooper responding
and I'm a block away.'

40:06.500 --> 40:08.458
(Cooper on radio)
'Officer down.'

40:08.542 --> 40:11.625
'East end of the bridge
at Diamond.'

40:11.709 --> 40:13.125
'I've been hit.'

40:13.208 --> 40:15.917
'Two shots outta nowhere.'

40:16.000 --> 40:18.166
That's Coop. Floor it.

40:25.625 --> 40:28.500
Jimmy...you out there?
