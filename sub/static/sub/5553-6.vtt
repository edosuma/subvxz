00:03.747 --> 00:05.213
SHELDON:
Leonard...

00:05.215 --> 00:06.715
I've got terrible news.

00:06.717 --> 00:07.582
What's going on?

00:07.584 --> 00:09.050
Before I tell you,

00:09.052 --> 00:11.519
perhaps I should
soften the blow.

00:11.521 --> 00:15.824
You're face
is pleasingly symmetrical.

00:15.826 --> 00:18.026
Just tell me.

00:18.028 --> 00:20.161
A Swedish team of physicists

00:20.163 --> 00:23.031
is trying to scoop our super-
fluid vortex experiment.

00:23.033 --> 00:25.133
Oh, well, that kind of stinks.

00:25.135 --> 00:26.801
“That kind of stinks”?

00:26.803 --> 00:28.603
Why aren't you more upset?

00:28.605 --> 00:30.205
Did I soften the blow too much?

00:30.207 --> 00:34.643
Because this here is more
like a Picasso painting.

00:34.645 --> 00:37.012
What are we going to do?

00:37.014 --> 00:38.513
Perform the experiment
immediately.

00:38.515 --> 00:40.415
I'd love to,
but we need liquid helium

00:40.417 --> 00:42.951
and our shipment's
on back order for a month.

00:42.953 --> 00:45.020
A month? What?
Are you kidding me?

00:45.022 --> 00:47.889
That would have been a good time
for you to soften the blow.

00:47.891 --> 00:51.326
That shirt brings out
the blue in your eyes.

00:51.328 --> 00:53.728
Thank you.
Aren't you sweet.

00:53.730 --> 00:55.764
Let's go check to see
if the university

00:55.766 --> 00:57.999
has any helium in reserve.

00:58.001 --> 01:01.403
Did you know that I almost
didn't wear this shirt today?

01:02.572 --> 01:04.438
Hey, Barry, we're in trouble.

01:04.441 --> 01:07.208
We need liquid helium-- does the
department have any we can use?

01:07.210 --> 01:08.576
Sorry, there's a shortage.

01:08.578 --> 01:11.212
And what we do have I need for
my quantum excitation study.

01:11.214 --> 01:13.381
But you won't
need much for that.

01:13.383 --> 01:14.749
True, but if it's successful,

01:14.751 --> 01:17.385
I'm having a party
with balloons.

01:17.387 --> 01:19.387
Come on, Barry,
there's a Swedish team

01:19.389 --> 01:21.022
trying to run our
experiment before us.

01:21.024 --> 01:22.190
Can't you spare any?

01:22.192 --> 01:24.893
Be honest-- if the shoe
was on the other foot,

01:24.895 --> 01:27.062
would you do this for me?

01:27.064 --> 01:29.564
Yes.
No chance.

01:29.566 --> 01:31.299
What are you doing?

01:31.301 --> 01:33.068
He said be honest,
so I was honest.

01:33.070 --> 01:35.503
Didn't your mother tell you?
It's the best policy.

01:35.505 --> 01:37.305
So, what do you say?

01:37.307 --> 01:38.406
Hell no.

01:40.510 --> 01:43.978
He could've
softened the blow.

02:13.362 --> 02:14.828
Why do you need Kripke?

02:14.830 --> 02:16.964
Why don't you just go
to Party City for helium?

02:16.966 --> 02:20.100
We'd have to go to every
Party City in California.

02:20.102 --> 02:23.470
Sounds like you
on Cinco de Mayo.

02:23.472 --> 02:26.640
Hey, people were still
talking about that party

02:26.642 --> 02:29.409
on <i> siete de Mayo.</i>

02:30.980 --> 02:32.179
Leonard, if that
Swedish team beats us,

02:32.181 --> 02:33.347
I will never be able to enjoy

02:33.349 --> 02:34.881
anything from
their country again.

02:34.883 --> 02:36.783
Which is a shame,
because Swedish meatballs

02:36.785 --> 02:41.121
are my favorite
toothpick-delivered meatball.

02:41.123 --> 02:44.524
If you need liquid helium
so bad, I know a guy

02:44.526 --> 02:47.060
who can get you some, if you
don't ask too many questions.

02:47.062 --> 02:48.228
Who is he?
Where does he work?

02:48.230 --> 02:49.629
How does he
get the helium?

02:49.631 --> 02:51.465
How many questions
are too many questions?

02:51.467 --> 02:53.266
Maybe he's not for you.

02:53.268 --> 02:56.236
Four questions.
There answer's four.

02:57.406 --> 02:58.605
Hey, you know
who went out

02:58.607 --> 03:00.107
on a date the other
night? Stuart.

03:00.109 --> 03:01.274
Oh, good for him.

03:01.276 --> 03:02.542
I thought so, too.

03:02.544 --> 03:07.014
So is she, like, homeless,
or framing him for a crime?

03:07.016 --> 03:09.816
He's using some kind
of dating app on his phone.

03:09.818 --> 03:11.251
Oh, which one?

03:11.253 --> 03:12.486
Maybe we can get Amy to try it.

03:12.488 --> 03:14.488
I don't know.

03:14.490 --> 03:16.056
Stuart, can you come in here?

03:16.058 --> 03:17.758
He tried to explain it to me.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.493
It shows you pictures
of people nearby,

03:19.495 --> 03:22.896
you swipe them around,
it looks kind of like a game.

03:22.898 --> 03:26.500
Oh, and if you lose the game,
you have to go out with Stuart.

03:28.871 --> 03:29.870
What's up?

03:29.872 --> 03:32.105
Can you show us that dating app?

03:32.107 --> 03:33.740
Oh, yeah, sure.

03:33.742 --> 03:36.576
This thing has changed my life.

03:36.578 --> 03:38.011
Wow. So how many
girls have you met?

03:38.013 --> 03:39.679
Two.

03:40.616 --> 03:41.782
I probably don't need to mention

03:41.784 --> 03:44.885
there's an entire number
between that and zero.

03:44.887 --> 03:46.520
Well, so how
does it work?

03:46.522 --> 03:48.955
Uh, well, it-it shows me all

03:48.957 --> 03:51.258
the single women
in a five-mile radius

03:51.260 --> 03:52.692
who are using the app.

03:52.694 --> 03:55.128
If I like the way they look,
I hit “thumbs up.”

03:55.130 --> 03:57.030
If I don't, “thumbs down.”

03:57.032 --> 03:58.932
Oh, what would make you
give a girl a thumbs down?

03:58.934 --> 04:03.437
First time it happens
I will let you know.

04:04.606 --> 04:08.275
Oh, hey. I just heard back
from the liquid helium guy.

04:08.277 --> 04:10.077
What's he say?

04:10.079 --> 04:12.813
He's got what we need
and can meet us tonight.

04:12.815 --> 04:15.148
Oh, really?

04:15.150 --> 04:17.551
You know I don't like
buying things at night.

04:18.754 --> 04:20.087
January 7, 2009.

04:20.089 --> 04:22.456
I went to the Ralph's
at 11:30pm to pick up

04:22.458 --> 04:24.591
Cracklin' Oat Bran for the
morning and what did I see?

04:24.593 --> 04:26.126
The man restocking
the cereal shelves.

04:26.128 --> 04:27.627
That's right.
And what did he do?

04:27.629 --> 04:31.631
He handed you the box directly
and called you Stretch.

04:31.633 --> 04:33.600
(shudders)

04:33.602 --> 04:36.303
It's like it was yesterday.

04:36.305 --> 04:38.572
Do you want
liquid helium or not?

04:38.574 --> 04:39.739
Of course I do.

04:39.741 --> 04:41.675
I don't want that
Swedish team scooping us.

04:41.677 --> 04:43.477
Then I'm going
to tell him we're in.

04:43.479 --> 04:46.646
Leonard, wait.
This is highly unethical.

04:46.648 --> 04:48.381
We're just bending
the rules a little.

04:48.383 --> 04:50.484
We have grant money
to do the experiment,

04:50.486 --> 04:53.186
so we're going to spend it
on the helium we need.

04:53.188 --> 04:54.654
It's not like when Dr. Goldfarb

04:54.656 --> 04:56.756
claimed he bought
an electron microscope

04:56.758 --> 04:58.058
and he was really just keeping

04:58.060 --> 05:01.795
a Russian girl
in an apartment in Van Nuys.

05:01.797 --> 05:06.399
Was she helping him
with his research?

05:08.504 --> 05:09.903
Sure.

05:10.906 --> 05:12.239
So, are we doing this?

05:12.241 --> 05:14.274
Okay, but where
does he get the helium?

05:14.276 --> 05:16.009
Remember?
Don't ask too many questions?

05:16.011 --> 05:18.512
Uh, but this is
violating university code.

05:18.514 --> 05:20.347
A little, but...
(stammers)

05:20.349 --> 05:21.948
if I may quote Einstein,

05:21.950 --> 05:24.084
“The pursuit of science calls us

05:24.086 --> 05:26.887
to ignore the rules set by man”"

05:26.889 --> 05:28.722
Huh.

05:28.724 --> 05:29.990
All right, do it.

05:29.992 --> 05:31.358
Tell him we're in.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.026
(Leonard typing rapidly)

05:33.028 --> 05:35.295
Done.

05:35.297 --> 05:37.297
I can't find that quote
on the Internet.

05:37.299 --> 05:39.432
Did you make that up?

05:41.803 --> 05:43.203
Before I answer,

05:43.205 --> 05:46.373
may I just say your skin
has never looked better.

05:48.911 --> 05:51.311
Aren't you just made of sugar.

05:53.916 --> 05:56.183
I'm not sure
how I feel about this.

05:56.185 --> 05:57.717
Oh, come on, just let him
put the app on your phone.

05:57.719 --> 05:59.519
Yeah, Stuart got
two dates with it.

05:59.521 --> 06:03.323
One of which would've ended
in sex had she not said no.

06:04.593 --> 06:06.359
Okay, all set.

06:06.361 --> 06:07.794
Okay, let me see.
(clears her throat)

06:07.796 --> 06:09.563
Nope, nope,

06:09.565 --> 06:11.464
nope...

06:11.466 --> 06:12.832
Oh, he's cute!

06:12.834 --> 06:14.434
Doesn't a teardrop tattoo

06:14.436 --> 06:17.504
mean he murdered someone?

06:17.506 --> 06:20.373
And he's sad about it.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.742
Hey.
Hello.

06:22.744 --> 06:24.945
Hey.
Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?

06:24.947 --> 06:26.313
If you wanted me
to stay out later,

06:26.315 --> 06:28.815
you should've given me
more spending money.

06:29.785 --> 06:30.917
What are you guys up to?

06:30.919 --> 06:32.085
We put Amy on a dating app,

06:32.087 --> 06:33.320
and we're seeing
what's out there.

06:33.322 --> 06:35.088
Oh, fun!
Let me see.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.123
Uh, no...

06:37.125 --> 06:39.993
no, uh, definitely not.

06:39.995 --> 06:42.128
What was wrong
with that guy?

06:42.130 --> 06:43.496
Uh, he's Indian.

06:43.498 --> 06:45.699
We've already got one of those.

06:47.135 --> 06:48.702
Ooh, we should
find a nice Latino.

06:48.704 --> 06:51.304
It really round us out.

06:51.306 --> 06:52.539
Hey, I want to try.

06:52.541 --> 06:54.474
Uh, excuse me,
c-can I have my phone back?

06:54.476 --> 06:55.709
Hang on, I'm trying
to find you

06:55.711 --> 06:57.210
the next great
love of your life.

06:57.212 --> 06:58.979
The man who will
father your children.

06:58.981 --> 07:00.814
Okay, yes or no on white
guy with dreadlocks?

07:00.816 --> 07:03.516
(all clamoring)

07:10.692 --> 07:12.926
That must be him.

07:12.928 --> 07:14.761
SHELDON:
Oh, of course.

07:14.763 --> 07:17.097
An nondescript,
white panel van.

07:17.099 --> 07:19.199
You may be familiar with
it from the sentence:

07:19.201 --> 07:23.703
“Their bodies were found in a
nondescript, white panel van”"

07:25.907 --> 07:27.907
(doors close)

07:29.411 --> 07:31.011
Hey.

07:31.013 --> 07:32.078
What's up?

07:32.080 --> 07:33.113
Uh, I'm Leonard.

07:33.115 --> 07:34.514
This is my friend--
I'm Skippy.

07:34.516 --> 07:36.216
Skippy Cavanaugh.

07:36.218 --> 07:38.418
Great.

07:38.420 --> 07:39.552
You got the cash?

07:39.554 --> 07:40.787
Uh, yeah, uh,
right here.

07:40.789 --> 07:42.289
Wait, hold on, hold on.

07:42.291 --> 07:43.723
How do we know
that you're not gonna

07:43.725 --> 07:45.558
take the money
and drive away?

07:45.560 --> 07:48.295
What ya doing, Skippy?

07:48.297 --> 07:50.897
Exactly what 1970s television
crime dramas have taught us.

07:50.899 --> 07:54.534
You give us the helium first.

07:54.536 --> 07:56.403
Oh, how do I know
you're not gonna

07:56.405 --> 07:57.737
drive away without paying me?

07:57.739 --> 07:59.739
Guess I'm not the only one

07:59.741 --> 08:01.741
who watches '70s television
crime dramas.

08:02.577 --> 08:03.977
Look, you can trust us.

08:03.979 --> 08:06.079
We're respected scientists.

08:06.081 --> 08:07.447
Well, he is.

08:07.449 --> 08:09.316
I'm a wedding planner,

08:09.318 --> 08:11.918
who can't find love himself.

08:13.355 --> 08:15.522
It's ironic, but the point is

08:15.524 --> 08:17.057
we can't trust you.

08:17.059 --> 08:20.293
You're a sketchy character
in a parking garage.

08:20.295 --> 08:21.761
Yeah, well,
from my perspective,

08:21.763 --> 08:23.263
that's how you two appear to me.

08:23.265 --> 08:26.533
Well, I never thought
of it like that.

08:26.535 --> 08:30.036
Boy, frame of reference will
just sneak up on you, won't it?

08:31.206 --> 08:33.106
My friend does make a decent
point about the money.

08:33.107 --> 08:35.475
I don't feel comfortable
just handing it over up front.

08:35.477 --> 08:37.777
Ah-ah-ah, no money, no helium.

08:37.779 --> 08:41.181
Seems we're at a, uh, stalemate.

08:41.183 --> 08:42.816
Not technically.

08:42.818 --> 08:44.851
In chess, a stalemate
refers to a situation

08:44.853 --> 08:46.886
in which there
are no remaining moves.

08:46.888 --> 08:48.988
Uh, you have plenty
of moves available.

08:48.990 --> 08:51.391
You could beat us up
and steal the money.

08:52.361 --> 08:54.661
You could kill us,
you know.

08:54.663 --> 08:58.798
Really, you're only limited
by your imagination.

09:00.135 --> 09:01.368
Huh.

09:01.370 --> 09:03.069
All these years,
I've been using “stalemate,”

09:03.071 --> 09:05.138
when I really mean “impasse.”

09:05.140 --> 09:07.674
I feel foolish.

09:09.911 --> 09:12.445
I don't think it matters
if this is a stalemate

09:12.447 --> 09:14.814
or an impasse
or a Mexican standoff.

09:14.816 --> 09:16.049
What are we gonna do here?

09:16.051 --> 09:17.784
Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it be
a Mexican standoff?

09:17.786 --> 09:20.453
Everybody knows you need
three sides for that.

09:20.455 --> 09:21.988
Not necessarily.

09:21.990 --> 09:24.391
Uh, many argue the essence
of a Mexican standoff

09:24.393 --> 09:26.659
is that no one can walk
away from the conflict

09:26.661 --> 09:28.762
without incurring harm.

09:28.764 --> 09:31.498
Hmm, I don't follow.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.266
Let me give you an example.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.835
Earlier today,

09:35.837 --> 09:37.670
I decoded the headers
on your e-mail,

09:37.672 --> 09:39.906
and I know that your name is
Kenneth Fitzgerald.

09:39.908 --> 09:42.609
From that, I figured out where
you live and where you work.

09:42.611 --> 09:45.011
Now, to make this
a Mexican standoff,

09:45.013 --> 09:46.780
I would say something like, uh,

09:46.782 --> 09:50.383
“You give us the helium or I'll
turn you in to the authorities”"

09:50.385 --> 09:51.818
Is that a threat?

09:51.820 --> 09:54.154
Yeah, exactly.
See, you're getting it.

09:54.156 --> 09:56.923
Yeah, well, I know
where you work, all right?

09:56.925 --> 09:58.725
And if you mess with me,
I'll report you,

09:58.727 --> 10:00.627
then I'll pound your asses
into the ground.

10:00.629 --> 10:03.530
Perfect! Now we really are
in a Mexican standoff.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.167
Is this one of those times

10:07.169 --> 10:10.336
where I've won the battle
but lost the war?

10:10.338 --> 10:13.640
Afraid so, Skippy.

10:13.642 --> 10:16.376
I told you we shouldn't
go shopping at night.

10:24.927 --> 10:26.961
All right, let's
all just calm down.

10:26.963 --> 10:28.662
Nobody wants to
report anybody.

10:28.664 --> 10:30.030
No, I don't like this.
I'm out.

10:30.032 --> 10:31.799
No, no, no. Wait, don't go.

10:31.801 --> 10:33.067
Just let me explain.

10:33.069 --> 10:35.102
We're physicists,
and we're trying to prove

10:35.104 --> 10:37.838
a hypothesis that we've been
working on for over a year.

10:37.840 --> 10:41.208
Really? What's the hypothesis?

10:41.210 --> 10:43.143
Space-time can be interpreted as

10:43.145 --> 10:45.613
the surface of
an n-dimensional superfluid.

10:45.615 --> 10:47.281
Hmm. Could be, could be.

10:47.283 --> 10:49.049
Go on.

10:50.853 --> 10:53.420
Okay, but now there's this
Swedish team that read our paper

10:53.422 --> 10:55.923
and they're trying to beat us
to our own discovery.

10:56.859 --> 10:58.158
We really need this helium.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.460
And I'm sorry
I lied about

10:59.462 --> 11:01.862
being a wedding planner
who can't find love.

11:01.864 --> 11:04.898
Although I am currently
single, if you know anybody.

11:06.002 --> 11:07.835
Here's the money.
Can we do this?

11:07.837 --> 11:10.104
Okay.

11:11.574 --> 11:13.674
It's a shame about those
scientists ripping you off.

11:13.676 --> 11:15.542
I expected a higher
ethical standard

11:15.544 --> 11:17.444
from our friends in Sweden.

11:19.115 --> 11:21.148
It's actually pretty common
in our field.

11:21.150 --> 11:22.750
Not much you can do about it.

11:22.752 --> 11:24.251
Well, for the right
amount of money,

11:24.253 --> 11:25.452
if you know where they live,

11:25.454 --> 11:26.854
there's, uh, plenty
we could do about it.

11:26.856 --> 11:28.822
Did you hear
that, Leonard?

11:28.824 --> 11:31.458
There's plenty we
could do about it.

11:32.395 --> 11:35.362
Do you have a card?

11:36.532 --> 11:38.866
Okay, here we go.

11:38.868 --> 11:40.067
Now everyone can see.

11:40.069 --> 11:41.201
All right.
(clears throat)

11:41.203 --> 11:43.570
Where do we stand
on cross-eyed Mike?

11:45.107 --> 11:48.809
You know he won't be
looking at other girls.

11:51.847 --> 11:54.782
Unless they're sitting
on the end of his nose.

11:55.551 --> 11:57.685
Okay, okay, okay.
Thumbs down.

11:57.687 --> 11:59.253
Next.

11:59.255 --> 12:01.255
Ew, check out
his tiny teeth.

12:01.257 --> 12:03.490
He looks like
a man-dolphin.

12:04.593 --> 12:07.394
Wait, if he's good in bed,
she can throw him a fish.

12:08.798 --> 12:10.197
(high-pitched):
I love you, Amy.

12:10.199 --> 12:12.399
(squeaking)

12:16.138 --> 12:18.405
Okay, I'm starting
to feel guilty.

12:18.407 --> 12:20.641
Aren't we being a little mean?

12:21.977 --> 12:23.877
That's a fair point.

12:23.879 --> 12:26.647
We wouldn't make fun of someone
like this to their face.

12:27.483 --> 12:29.850
Look, it's Stuart!

12:32.321 --> 12:35.089
You may want
to leave the room.

12:39.128 --> 12:42.329
SHELDON:
Right this way, Uncle Harvey.

12:47.069 --> 12:49.069
Will you stop with that already?

12:49.071 --> 12:52.372
I'm trying
not to attract attention.

12:52.374 --> 12:55.442
And tipping his hat to the
cleaning lady didn't do that?

12:55.444 --> 12:59.012
She said,<i> “Buenas noches.”</i>
What was he supposed to do?

12:59.014 --> 13:00.981
Let's just start
the experiment.

13:00.983 --> 13:02.916
Leonard, we should probably
have our story straight

13:02.918 --> 13:04.284
in case we get caught.

13:04.286 --> 13:06.053
We're not getting caught.

13:06.055 --> 13:07.154
Well, you can't be sure of that.

13:07.156 --> 13:09.189
What if the helium dealer
rats us out?

13:09.191 --> 13:11.325
What if Kripke asks
where we got it?

13:11.327 --> 13:13.227
What if the university
checks my family tree

13:13.229 --> 13:15.829
and finds out
I don't have an Uncle Harvey?

13:15.831 --> 13:19.133
The dealer doesn't care,
Kripke has no authority over us,

13:19.135 --> 13:21.001
and you being related
to a metal container

13:21.003 --> 13:24.004
would explain a lot.

13:24.006 --> 13:27.374
Help me hook this up.

13:27.376 --> 13:28.575
Uh-oh.
What?

13:28.577 --> 13:30.677
Well, did you see this sticker?
What is it?

13:30.679 --> 13:33.280
It's partially torn off, but
the segment that remains reads:

13:33.282 --> 13:36.083
“Property of”
and the letter “U.”

13:36.085 --> 13:37.918
It's probably USC or UCLA.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.487
Yeah, but what if it's
“Property of U.S. Government”?

13:40.489 --> 13:43.223
There's a national helium
reserve in Amarillo, Texas.

13:43.225 --> 13:44.658
If this was stolen from there,

13:44.660 --> 13:46.660
we're accessories
to a federal crime.

13:46.662 --> 13:48.162
Let's not jump to conclusions.

13:48.164 --> 13:49.730
A lot of things start with “U.”

13:49.732 --> 13:50.764
That's true.

13:50.766 --> 13:52.833
There's the U.S. Air Force,

13:52.835 --> 13:55.302
U.S. Department of Defense,
U.S. Navy,

13:55.304 --> 13:57.638
“you” and I
are going to jail.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.140
Listen, we can
do the experiment as planned

14:00.142 --> 14:01.909
and beat the Swedish team
to the punch,

14:01.911 --> 14:04.144
or we can kiss our dreams
good-bye because we were

14:04.146 --> 14:06.313
to afraid to break a few rules.

14:10.052 --> 14:11.518
Ma'am.

14:14.790 --> 14:16.690
Okay, does everyone
remember the rules?

14:16.692 --> 14:19.126
If he's shirtless, one sip.

14:19.128 --> 14:20.961
Posing with a pet, two sips.

14:20.963 --> 14:23.997
Pet and shirtless,
chug like it's your job.

14:25.334 --> 14:27.568
And pull!

14:31.207 --> 14:33.907
I have that
same underwear!

14:35.144 --> 14:36.210
Chug!

14:36.212 --> 14:38.078
(phone chimes)

14:38.080 --> 14:40.447
Mm, Amy,
you're getting a text.

14:40.449 --> 14:42.115
Oh, um, give me that.

14:42.117 --> 14:43.917
KOOTHRAPPALI:
“I had a great time last night”"

14:43.919 --> 14:45.319
No, no, st-stop reading that.

14:45.321 --> 14:46.553
Who's Dave?
I...

14:46.555 --> 14:47.721
You went on a date last night?

14:47.723 --> 14:48.655
Are you seeing someone?

14:48.657 --> 14:49.656
No, it-it's not like that.

14:49.658 --> 14:50.757
(phone chimes)

14:50.759 --> 14:53.493
“And I'd love to take you
out again”?

14:53.495 --> 14:54.528
Amy!
What?

14:54.530 --> 14:56.263
Can't believe it.
Oh, my God.

14:56.265 --> 14:58.365
Okay, it's like that.

15:00.569 --> 15:03.003
Thank you for coming back.

15:03.005 --> 15:04.371
Yeah, well, normally I wouldn't,

15:04.373 --> 15:06.506
but my daughter's having
a sleepover, and there's only

15:06.508 --> 15:09.810
so much screaming and Katy Perry
a man can take.

15:09.812 --> 15:13.213
Anyway, if you could just
give us our money back,

15:13.215 --> 15:15.616
you can have your helium
and we'll be on our way.

15:15.618 --> 15:17.484
Yeah, well, is there
something wrong with it?

15:17.486 --> 15:19.887
No, nothing.
We just changed our mind.

15:19.889 --> 15:21.855
He has glasses and
I'm a know-it-all;

15:21.857 --> 15:24.324
we are not built
for prison.

15:24.326 --> 15:25.859
Yeah, I hear you.

15:25.861 --> 15:27.661
Well, you're good guys,
so I'll, uh...

15:27.663 --> 15:29.396
I'll take the helium
off your hands.

15:29.398 --> 15:30.397
Thank you.

15:30.399 --> 15:32.666
But you ain't getting
your money back.

15:32.668 --> 15:35.936
You're taking advantage of us?

15:35.938 --> 15:39.273
We clarified nomenclature
together.

15:39.275 --> 15:41.675
Look, I enjoy
semantic digressions

15:41.677 --> 15:45.479
as much as the next guy,
but, uh, this is business.

15:45.481 --> 15:47.381
You know what?

15:47.383 --> 15:48.615
It's fine.
Keep the money.

15:48.617 --> 15:50.550
We just want to be
done with this.

15:50.552 --> 15:52.586
No problem, but I am
gonna have to charge you

15:52.588 --> 15:55.422
a small helium restocking fee.

15:55.424 --> 15:56.957
I don't understand.

15:56.959 --> 15:58.158
He wants more money.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.994
Well, it better not be more than
a thousand dollars;

16:00.996 --> 16:02.696
that's all I've got on me.

16:04.433 --> 16:08.001
That's exactly how much it is.

16:08.003 --> 16:09.403
Finally,

16:09.405 --> 16:11.438
something breaks our way.

16:15.110 --> 16:16.643
I can't believe
you're seeing someone

16:16.645 --> 16:17.778
and we don't even know about it.

16:17.780 --> 16:19.713
Yeah, why wouldn't
you tell us?

16:19.715 --> 16:21.148
Because it's new and weird

16:21.150 --> 16:23.417
and I'm just trying
to figure it all out.

16:23.419 --> 16:24.484
And I knew

16:24.486 --> 16:26.086
if I told you guys
I had been out

16:26.088 --> 16:28.155
with a few people that you'd get
way too excited about it.

16:28.157 --> 16:29.056
A few people?

16:29.058 --> 16:31.091
What?!
Amy! - Amy!

16:32.027 --> 16:34.594
So, are we allowed to ask
how it's going?

16:34.596 --> 16:35.996
It's going fine.

16:35.998 --> 16:38.332
It's mostly just been
meeting people for coffee.

16:38.334 --> 16:41.301
Wha...?!

16:41.303 --> 16:42.703
I thought we
were all...

16:42.705 --> 16:44.671
Never mind.

16:45.507 --> 16:47.007
I-I thought you
weren't ready

16:47.009 --> 16:48.475
to start seeing people.

16:48.477 --> 16:50.344
Well, I don't have
much experience dating,

16:50.346 --> 16:52.212
so I decided
it would be good for me

16:52.214 --> 16:53.847
to, you know,
get out there a little.

16:53.849 --> 16:55.716
Well, good for you.

16:55.718 --> 16:57.651
Thank you.

16:57.653 --> 16:59.553
And how many guys
have you gone out with?

16:59.555 --> 17:00.721
Please be less than two.

17:00.723 --> 17:02.589
Three.
Damn it.

17:05.060 --> 17:08.494
Well, the Swedes
might beat us,

17:08.497 --> 17:12.031
but at least we won't get
gang-noogied in prison.

17:13.769 --> 17:18.070
Is <i> Ernest Goes to Jail</i> the only
prison movie you've seen?

17:18.073 --> 17:20.874
It scared me straight, Leonard.

17:20.876 --> 17:22.642
(knock on door)

17:22.644 --> 17:24.877
Hey, I've been thinking.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.579
I was being petty.

17:26.582 --> 17:28.615
You can have my helium.

17:29.084 --> 17:30.784
Thank you, Barry.

17:30.786 --> 17:33.754
But you have to add my name
to your paper.

17:34.757 --> 17:36.123
That's preposterous.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.457
I don't know, seems fair.

17:37.459 --> 17:39.059
You can't do it without me.

17:40.062 --> 17:41.094
Can you give us a minute?

17:41.096 --> 17:42.229
Take your time.

17:42.231 --> 17:45.465
I'll walk out backwards
for dramatic effect.

17:51.974 --> 17:54.408
I don't like
being extorted like this.

17:54.410 --> 17:56.276
Especially by him of all people.

17:56.278 --> 17:59.346
Me neither, but what
other choice do we have?

17:59.348 --> 18:02.416
I promise this is the last time.

18:04.000 --> 18:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:12.298 --> 18:14.332
It says right here
on Wikipedia.

18:14.334 --> 18:16.768
"A Mexican standoff is
a confrontation between

18:16.770 --> 18:18.036
at least three parties."

18:18.038 --> 18:20.104
How can you trust Wikipedia

18:20.106 --> 18:23.942
if they use "between"
to refer to three parties?

18:25.010 --> 18:27.345
They should've used
"among," right?

18:29.348 --> 18:33.418
Or "amongst," if they were
feeling whimsically archaic.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.186
All right,
enough with the chitchat.

18:35.188 --> 18:38.056
Are we gonna watch
<i>Ernest Goes to Jail</i> or not?

18:38.058 --> 18:39.457
Absolutely.

18:39.459 --> 18:41.593
But don't be surprised
if this movie sets you

18:41.595 --> 18:45.168
on the straight and narrow.
I am open to change.
