WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.371
Those of you here last night
heard my new set,

00:03.404 --> 00:05.573
inspired
by a down-and-out lawyer

00:05.606 --> 00:07.108
who is the saddest,

00:07.141 --> 00:10.044
most unfortunate soul
I have ever met.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.579
This first song's called
"Unlucky Tucky."

00:11.612 --> 00:14.515
Warner Brothers bought my book
for six figures!

00:14.548 --> 00:17.485
Get out of here!
That's awesome!

00:17.518 --> 00:18.586
I'm so sorry about Lavon.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.189
How are you?
Fine as I can be.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.456
Given that my heart is crushed,

00:22.490 --> 00:24.258
and I'm probably gonna die alone
and whatnot.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.260
Joel, what's the matter?
I have to go to Los Angeles.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.528
How long are you gonna be gone?

00:27.561 --> 00:28.529
They said

00:28.562 --> 00:30.064
six months.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.632
S...?

00:34.568 --> 00:37.171
Hello there,

00:37.205 --> 00:39.440
Lord Joel.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.841
It's me,

00:40.874 --> 00:43.544
Emily Bronte.

00:43.577 --> 00:47.415
And I'm about to write
my next great novel.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.283
Right after I take off

00:49.317 --> 00:52.253
all these clothes.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.488
(clears throat)

00:54.522 --> 00:57.125
Ooh, it's stuck.

00:57.158 --> 01:00.094
All these clothes.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.063
Come... on!

01:05.333 --> 01:07.301
Oop!

01:07.335 --> 01:08.602
Zoe, what's, uh,

01:08.636 --> 01:10.104
what's going on here?

01:10.138 --> 01:12.440
I was making a video
for you to take to L.A.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.875
Something to remember me by

01:14.908 --> 01:16.444
in those lonely moments.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.511
Are you Emily Bronte?

01:17.545 --> 01:18.879
You said she had a sexy brain.

01:18.912 --> 01:19.847
(laughs)

01:19.880 --> 01:21.182
Will please help me up?

01:21.215 --> 01:22.550
(laughing):
One sec.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.651
Wait, what are you doing?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.486
Stop it, no, don't you...!

01:25.519 --> 01:27.121
I'm sorry, this is
how I want to remember you.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.256
All tangled up in a corset

01:28.289 --> 01:31.425
because you tried to do
a literary striptease for me.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.194
I'll tell you, I
don't need a video.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.463
Because you, Zoe Hart,
are unforgettable.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.630
Just please cut me
out of this thing!

01:36.664 --> 01:38.132
Sounds kind of hot.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.867
(both laugh)

01:39.900 --> 01:40.868
Really?
Mm-hmm.

01:40.901 --> 01:41.869
(British accent):
Really?

01:41.902 --> 01:45.206
Mayor Hayes?

01:45.239 --> 01:47.341
Hello, Rose.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.576
You can call me
Madam Ambassador.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.144
My school just
elected me attachÃ©

01:50.178 --> 01:51.345
for our sister city's visitors.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.147
Congratulations.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.114
Wait a second.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.450
What-what sister city?
What-what visitors?

01:56.484 --> 01:57.685
The visitors from the town
of ClocheBleue

01:57.718 --> 01:59.253
in Alsace-Lorraine of course.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.522
A bunch of French people
are coming to BlueBell?

02:01.555 --> 02:03.391
Just as soon as you e-mail
their mayor and arrange it.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.626
Bonjour, Lavon?

02:05.659 --> 02:07.261
Every ten years a contingent

02:07.295 --> 02:09.163
from one sister city
visits the other.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.431
This decade
it's our turn to host.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.899
Okay, Rose, I get
that you want this.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.268
But, you know, hosting some
boring French mayor dude's

02:14.302 --> 02:15.569
the last thing I
need right now.

02:15.603 --> 02:16.570
No, no, the mayor

02:16.604 --> 02:18.639
Eloise Tiberghien is a woman.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.641
A former ballerina actually.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.243
WADE:
Ooh-la-la.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.444
I'll tell you what, dude.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.279
The way you've been moping
around here the last few weeks,

02:25.313 --> 02:26.614
a short visit
from a hot French ballerina

02:26.647 --> 02:28.516
might be just what you need.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.284
Oui.

02:30.318 --> 02:33.621
Yeah, you might be right.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.426
(groans)

02:44.298 --> 02:45.366
Oh!

02:45.399 --> 02:46.367
God, Lemon!

02:46.400 --> 02:49.270
Don't you ever knock?

02:49.303 --> 02:50.671
I thought this would be
more dramatic.

02:50.704 --> 02:54.308
Plus I brought you breakfast
and an amazing idea.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.376
Well, next time
bring me a deadbolt

02:55.409 --> 02:57.378
and some pajamas, please.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.413
(laughs)
Your modesty is so adorable.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.282
But after 15 years
of being together, trust me,

03:01.315 --> 03:02.483
I know every little nook
and cranny.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.384
Okay, yeah, yeah.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.718
It's time for you
to get off my boat.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.686
Just as soon
as you hear my idea.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.488
As you know,

03:07.521 --> 03:10.258
Shelby is selling Fancie's
and I intend on buying it.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.759
But I face two minor hurdles.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.361
One...
You don't have the money.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.230
And two...

03:16.264 --> 03:17.231
Shelby won't sell you Fancie's

03:17.265 --> 03:19.633
'cause your dad tried
to sabotage her cabaret.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.235
15 years.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.570
Goes a lot deeper
than nooks and crannies.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.671
That's why I know what
you're gonna say next.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.638
No, you don't.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.640
You want me to purchase
Fancie's in my name,

03:26.674 --> 03:28.642
sell you half and be
your business partner.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.479
No, I want you to purchase
Fancie's in your name,

03:31.512 --> 03:33.747
sell me half
and be my silent partner.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.449
No, no, no way.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.785
George, you need this nearly
as much as I do, okay?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.520
To fill in that void left
from that crazy

03:39.553 --> 03:40.654
line of women
that you've been dating.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.524
By going into business
with the craziest one of all?

03:43.557 --> 03:44.592
No, thank you.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.593
Me?
Yeah.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.660
But me?
Yeah!

03:46.694 --> 03:48.028
I'm the crazy one
in this scenario.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.463
Uh-huh.
George, that is...

03:49.497 --> 03:50.364
That is...

03:50.398 --> 03:51.532
rich!

03:51.565 --> 03:52.700
You know what?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.335
Offer is revoked.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.371
At least leave breakfast, you...

03:57.405 --> 03:58.406
TODD:
 Today I brought you to the base

03:58.439 --> 04:01.675
of an active volcano
to remind you-- activate!

04:01.709 --> 04:04.645
He makes me feel like
so much less of a man.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.781
As you swing
through the hitting area...

04:07.815 --> 04:08.816
WOMAN:
Look, there's Joel!

04:08.849 --> 04:10.484
MAN:
There's Joel!

04:10.518 --> 04:11.385
(gasps)

04:11.419 --> 04:13.454
They're here.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.556
What?

04:15.589 --> 04:18.024
Joel.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.728
Stanley and I so
appreciated having

04:20.761 --> 04:22.463
another artist in our midst.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.598
So we have prepared
a number for you.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.500
* Oh, Joel Stephens

04:26.534 --> 04:29.637
* We'll miss you so,
don't leave, don't leave *

04:29.670 --> 04:31.839
* We just hate to see you go

04:31.872 --> 04:33.674
* Oh, please don't leave

04:33.707 --> 04:36.076
* Your talent got you far

04:36.109 --> 04:38.812
* You're gonna be a star

04:38.846 --> 04:41.582
* So, Joel Stephens,
can we have some parts *

04:41.615 --> 04:43.817
* In your movie?

04:43.851 --> 04:45.553
Oh, oh, I...

04:45.586 --> 04:47.087
No, I-I don't think

04:47.120 --> 04:49.056
that I'm really in charge
of those decisions.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.591
Well, we're classically trained.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.093
Yup. Hi!
Ah, Joel!

04:53.126 --> 04:54.428
I'm gonna miss you, man.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.796
I-I got you

04:55.829 --> 04:57.731
a-a box set of Game of Thrones.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.533
Figured you could
watch it on the plane.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.101
What? That is amazing, man.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.336
Thank you so much.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.604
Very nice.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.638
Joel, let's go sit.

05:04.672 --> 05:05.839
Yeah, thanks.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.846
Oh, no! Not you, too?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.548
Shut up.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.483
(laughs)
Hey, man, I even got

05:15.516 --> 05:17.551
an e-mail account
so we can stay in touch.

05:17.585 --> 05:18.786
All right?
All the time, buddy.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.120
All right.
All right.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.690
(cell phone ringing)
Oh.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.558
Ooh, it's my new agent David.

05:24.592 --> 05:25.693
Hold on a sec.
Ooh.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.362
Hey, David, hi!
You okay?

05:28.396 --> 05:29.363
Dr. Hart?

05:29.397 --> 05:30.431
Yes?

05:30.464 --> 05:31.565
You can't let
Joel Stephens leave.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.900
He's not leaving.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.702
It's an extended business trip.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.537
We are committed
to making this work.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.472
If Joel goes,
then you two will break up.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.907
And then he won't come back.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.442
Don't be silly.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.710
We just bought a house together.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.744
In BlueBell.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.145
We won't even go
more than two weeks

05:45.178 --> 05:46.580
without seeing each other
live in person.

05:46.614 --> 05:47.915
It's not a big deal.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.618
It's a huge deal!
You have to realize that!

05:50.651 --> 05:53.721
99% of long-distance
relationships break up.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.155
What? No, they don't.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.457
Uh, it's a proven fact.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.658
Science, look it up.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.159
Fine.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.494
(sighs)

06:00.528 --> 06:01.829
(clears throat)

06:01.862 --> 06:03.931
See? It's not 99%!

06:03.964 --> 06:06.400
It's 75.
Oh.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.402
Well, this is a stupid study.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.137
Make him stay, please!

06:10.170 --> 06:11.805
Not just for my happiness.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.641
But for yours.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.582
Sorry, uh, David's just
got all these meetings

06:21.615 --> 06:23.851
set up for me
when I get out...

06:23.884 --> 06:24.952
Hey, you okay?

06:24.985 --> 06:27.488
Yes, I'm great.

06:27.521 --> 06:28.822
So great.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.161
Ooh, ladies?

06:34.194 --> 06:35.763
Are you aware that it is
less than a month

06:35.796 --> 06:37.698
till the Man of the Year?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.533
And I am finally gonna win!

06:39.567 --> 06:40.701
Oh, no, Daddy, not this again.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.702
No, no, no, no!

06:41.735 --> 06:43.504
The stars have finally aligned!

06:43.537 --> 06:45.172
George was holed up
in the Shamrock Motel.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.808
And he was dating
Lavon's crazy-eyed cousin.

06:47.841 --> 06:48.942
No one is gonna vote
for him again.

06:48.976 --> 06:49.977
And Lavon

06:50.010 --> 06:51.645
as mayor is ineligible.

06:51.679 --> 06:54.515
And Harley, rest his soul,
is dead.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.783
And Magnolia is
no longer around

06:55.816 --> 06:57.518
to taint my reputation.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.819
* MOTY
is mine *

06:58.852 --> 07:00.521
* MOTY is mine!

07:00.554 --> 07:01.655
That is great, Brick.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.790
If there's anything
we can do...

07:02.823 --> 07:03.791
Oh, A.B.?

07:03.824 --> 07:05.526
As co-head of the Belles,

07:05.559 --> 07:07.861
you can procure an endorsement.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.797
Ooh.

07:09.830 --> 07:10.898
Well.

07:10.931 --> 07:11.932
I suppose.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.767
Daddy, you know what?

07:13.801 --> 07:16.203
Um, let's face it.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.872
You've been a lot pricklier
than usual this past year.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.908
So how about you work
on your demeanor

07:20.941 --> 07:23.477
for the next few weeks and then
A.B. can approach the Belles?

07:23.511 --> 07:26.680
My demeanor? There's nothing
wrong with my demeanor!

07:26.714 --> 07:29.550
WOMAN:
Dr. Breeland?

07:29.583 --> 07:30.851
Little Grace Ann has
a tummy ache again.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.787
If you are going to vomit,

07:33.821 --> 07:35.022
you will use a bucket.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.924
And not the front
of my shirt again.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.025
You understand me, young lady?

07:38.058 --> 07:39.593
(Lemon clears throat)

07:40.994 --> 07:43.597
Uh, and two stickers

07:43.631 --> 07:45.599
for you today.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.635
Two... Right-right in here.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.704
Oh, hey, Zoe.

07:50.738 --> 07:51.905
How-how are you doing?

07:51.939 --> 07:53.240
Do you guys think
that long-distance

07:53.273 --> 07:54.775
relationships can actually work?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.910
If any can,
it's yours and Joel's.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.046
When George was in Europe,
we were long distance, too.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.247
Right!

08:00.280 --> 08:01.615
Mm-hmm.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.850
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

08:02.883 --> 08:03.951
(cell phone ringing)

08:03.984 --> 08:06.620
Babs, what's up?

08:06.654 --> 08:08.856
What?!

08:08.889 --> 08:09.857
(whistling)

08:09.890 --> 08:11.058
You stupid, stupid man!

08:11.091 --> 08:13.861
Because of you, Shelby leased
Fancie's to someone else!

08:13.894 --> 08:15.262
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.930
But I stand by my decision.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.600
Oh, yeah? Want to know
who she leased it to?

08:19.633 --> 08:20.534
LILY ANNE:
George!

08:20.568 --> 08:22.603
Lemon.

08:22.636 --> 08:23.971
I've had a revelation.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.272
So I'm leasing Fancie's.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.609
Thought it would be the perfect
place to debut my new material

08:28.642 --> 08:30.510
about my favorite muse.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.313
No!

08:33.346 --> 08:34.081
Yes.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.854
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

08:44.758 --> 08:45.993
Zoe?
Hmm?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.294
Are you okay?

08:47.327 --> 08:48.295
Yes.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.097
I have the best idea ever.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.732
I'll go to L.A. with you.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.734
I will go home and pack and
I'll catch the next flight.

08:53.767 --> 08:54.668
What?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.637
I asked you to come
with me a week ago.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.572
And you said
that A) you hated L.A.,

08:58.606 --> 08:59.973
B) you just got
back to BlueBell,

09:00.007 --> 09:01.575
C) you didn't want to be

09:01.609 --> 09:02.843
a groupie.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.044
And then back to "A" again.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.046
Uh, L.A. will grow on me.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.781
I'll get implants. I'll juice!

09:07.815 --> 09:09.583
(laughs)

09:09.617 --> 09:11.752
I don't, I don't want you
to give up your life for me.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.588
75% of long-distance
relationships break up.

09:14.622 --> 09:15.789
So what?

09:15.823 --> 09:18.058
Today the weatherman said
there was an 80% chance of rain,

09:18.091 --> 09:20.027
and there's not a cloud
in the sky.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.062
Look, Zoe, we are
going to make it.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.764
I promise you.

09:23.797 --> 09:24.798
Let me hear you say it.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.333
We're gonna make it.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.567
Yeah.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.604
(thunder crashes)

09:30.638 --> 09:32.039
(car alarm chirps)

09:37.745 --> 09:39.747
(thunder crashes)

09:41.749 --> 09:44.017
(car horn honks)

09:44.051 --> 09:46.086
(seagulls calling)

09:46.119 --> 09:48.588
(birds singing)

10:05.839 --> 10:07.975
(buttons beeping)

10:08.008 --> 10:09.109
(line ringing)

10:09.142 --> 10:10.744
Good morning, Joel.

10:10.778 --> 10:11.845
Whoa!

10:11.879 --> 10:14.147
What's, uh,
what's going on here?

10:14.181 --> 10:16.383
Well, I finally
figured out a way

10:16.416 --> 10:18.385
to get you to choose
some tile samples.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.988
First tell me the ones
that you don't like

10:21.021 --> 10:22.389
and I will remove them.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.858
And then the ones left,
we will put in our new kitchen.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.760
So we're picking tiles
based on the body parts

10:26.794 --> 10:27.861
I want to see first?

10:27.895 --> 10:29.129
Well, it's as good
a system as any.

10:29.162 --> 10:29.997
I love it.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.198
Tell you what, let's...

10:31.231 --> 10:33.433
Why don't you take off
the gray one?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.435
(whispering):
Uh, gray...

10:35.468 --> 10:36.670
Which gray one?

10:36.704 --> 10:37.805
That one.

10:39.773 --> 10:40.874
(whooshes)

10:40.908 --> 10:41.875
(phone chiming)
Oh.

10:41.909 --> 10:42.943
Oh, no, no, don't answer it.

10:42.976 --> 10:43.877
It's David.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.445
I'm sorry, one second,
I gotta take this.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.847
Hey, David.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.115
Well-- why does
she think...?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.017
(stuttering):
Hold on one sec.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.785
Sorry, honey,
I gotta go deal with this.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.186
We still have 38 tiles to go.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.788
(laughs) Look, I promise
I will make it all

10:54.822 --> 10:55.956
up to you
when you get here tonight.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.891
Fine.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.860
My flight gets in at 8:00
your time, I can't wait.

10:59.893 --> 11:00.861
Me neither.

11:00.894 --> 11:01.862
I love you.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.063
I love you, too.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.799
Wait, no! You gotta pick a tile,
because we need to pick...

11:05.833 --> 11:06.800
a tile!

11:06.834 --> 11:08.736
(sputters)

11:10.103 --> 11:11.772
Looks like a man
who needs a button.

11:11.805 --> 11:15.843
Oh! Patty, Prizzi,
don't you look so pretty today.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.144
You're an angel.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.079
You are so sweet!
It's just
my new lip liner...

11:19.112 --> 11:20.881
It's my new BB cream,
smoothes the lines.

11:20.914 --> 11:21.782
...plumps them right up.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.051
BOTH: Wait.
Are you talking about her?

11:24.084 --> 11:25.452
(stutters)
Both.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.453
Both.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.354
Uh, I assure you...

11:27.387 --> 11:30.457
Uh, Wanda, how is that
adorable baby goat?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.125
Tell me about it.
It's your worst nightmare.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.728
Lily Anne debuted
four new songs last night.

11:34.762 --> 11:35.729
Oh, God, don't tell me.

11:35.763 --> 11:36.930
Wait, tell me.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.732
"Locked in the Shamrock,"

11:38.766 --> 11:39.933
"Sad Lawyer Rides Again,"

11:39.967 --> 11:41.735
"I Object,"

11:41.769 --> 11:42.936
and "Sad Lawyer
Rides Again Again."

11:42.970 --> 11:45.072
I mean, seriously, are all
of her songs really about me?

11:45.105 --> 11:48.742
Not all-- she's still singing
her old standards like...

11:48.776 --> 11:50.210
"Run from Wade."
Yeah.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.512
Hey, Tucker,

11:52.545 --> 11:54.748
Vivian went over to Fancie's
last night with a coworker.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.249
I spent hours explaining
to her that Lily Anne

11:56.283 --> 12:00.187
takes a certain, uh, poetic
license with the facts.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.122
We need to get her
the hell out of town.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.991
I could not agree more.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.894
Well, well, well.
(laughs)

12:06.927 --> 12:09.863
The tides have turned.
Have they not, boys?

12:09.897 --> 12:11.765
I will help you remove
this blight to your name

12:11.799 --> 12:13.200
if you do something
for me in return.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.201
Yeah, whatever, Lemon.
(sighs)

12:14.234 --> 12:16.003
Nope, nope,
don't even say it.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.772
If I succeed, George buys
Fancie's with me.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.307
No. N-No,
that's a terrible idea.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.876
Owning a business together
is like being married,

12:22.910 --> 12:24.144
but without any
of the good parts.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.879
You and I were partners, Lemon,

12:25.913 --> 12:26.980
'cause we didn't have
any history.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.982
But you and Tucker.
(laughs)

12:29.016 --> 12:31.118
No.
Thank you. Thank you.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.252
That's what
I've been saying.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.787
That's what
I'm still saying.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.989
But he is the only one
with both the cash reserves

12:36.023 --> 12:38.058
and the cache with Shelby.
No!

12:38.091 --> 12:40.093
You know, I hear Lily Anne's
planning on recording

12:40.127 --> 12:41.061
a "Live from Fancie's" album.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.063
So, I'll go reserve that
on iTunes right now.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.131
(overlapping arguing)

12:44.164 --> 12:45.933
I think you'd make
great partners.
I'll do it.

12:45.966 --> 12:46.934
Yeah.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.302
So, the key is to get
into Lily Anne's head.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.238
Convince her that
Fancie's is not for her.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.540
I mean, she's absolutely nuts,
so that'll be easy to do.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.542
So, what are some things
that freak Lily Anne out?

12:55.575 --> 12:58.011
Kittens, hammocks.
Carbon monoxide.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.913
Monoxide.
Yeah, laryngitis.

12:59.947 --> 13:00.881
Smokers. Oranges.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.015
Norwegians.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.250
BOTH:
Ghosts.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.219
Well, boys...

13:06.253 --> 13:09.923
I guess we'd better
get a-hauntin'.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.026
Oh, no, no.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.027
The Belles endorsed
Stanley?

13:14.061 --> 13:16.063
Not Crickett's husband
Stanley.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.330
So, I am so sorry, Brick.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.833
Everyone could see how
hard you've been trying.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.034
But, um...

13:21.068 --> 13:23.103
Stanley threw the girls
a Botox party.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.272
Why didn't I think of that?
I'm the doctor!

13:25.305 --> 13:28.942
Look, you can still turn this
around if you win over the Owls.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.343
No, I'll-I'll try,
but I-I can't tell you

13:30.377 --> 13:32.179
what disappointing news this is.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.380
I've been watching my temper.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.282
I've been trying to stay calm.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.917
(children coughing)

13:36.950 --> 13:38.585
What in the holy hell
is going on here?

13:38.618 --> 13:40.988
A stomach flu outbreak
at the elementary school.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.322
Oh, good grief.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.391
Uh, uh, I'll get
the disinfectant.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.959
No one touch anything!

13:45.993 --> 13:47.160
No one!

13:47.194 --> 13:48.228
Ignore him, Hazel.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.197
I'm gonna make your tummy
feel all better, okay?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.199
Oh.
(chuckles)

13:52.232 --> 13:53.200
(phone rings)

13:53.233 --> 13:54.301
Oh, sorry.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.069
You know what,

13:56.103 --> 13:58.205
uh, that's my boyfriend,
I should get this.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.606
BRICK:
Where's the disinfectant?!

13:59.639 --> 14:01.975
Please don't leave me
with that mean man.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.245
Okay. Uh, you know what,
let's go in the exam room.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.014
I'm going to see
Joel tonight anyway.

14:11.018 --> 14:14.087
* He came here in misery

14:14.121 --> 14:17.224
* Grew a beard like Bob E. Lee

14:17.257 --> 14:21.094
* And they handed him
a motel key *

14:21.128 --> 14:24.965
* Now he's stuck in
the Shamrock Motel *

14:24.998 --> 14:26.666
* His life ain't
been going so... *

14:26.699 --> 14:27.634
(laughs)

14:27.667 --> 14:30.237
(laughs) Well,
Lemon Breeland, is that you?

14:30.270 --> 14:33.907
Lily Anne, how are you?
(laughs)

14:33.941 --> 14:36.443
I just love what you
have done with this place.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.012
I'm so sorry I haven't
been to your show.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.081
I hear that
it is superlative.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.249
That is so sweet of you.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.650
Oh... and you know what,

14:43.683 --> 14:46.987
good for you for not listening
to all those silly rumors.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.022
Thanks!
Yeah!

14:49.056 --> 14:50.157
Wait, what, what rumors?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.226
(man humming ghastly tune
over phone)

14:53.260 --> 14:54.394
Sounds good.
That was badass.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.263
All right, uh...
I'll set a timer?

14:56.296 --> 14:57.397
It'll go off
every three hours.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.166
All right, uh,
I'll get the light

14:59.199 --> 15:01.001
and I'll rig the furniture.
Okay, sounds good.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.435
You know how Shelby
left this place

15:02.469 --> 15:03.937
because she thought
it was haunted?

15:03.971 --> 15:05.005
Shelby is just so silly, right?

15:05.038 --> 15:07.307
Right.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.011
ROSE:
 Nous sommes tres tres excitÃ©s

15:11.044 --> 15:12.412
pour votre visite.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.347
Ce sera le point culminant
 de notre dÃ©cennie.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.985
Vous et votre ville serez
 traitÃ©s comme des rois!

15:18.018 --> 15:19.186
U-Uh, yeah, wh-what she said.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.253
Hello, uh, i-it's uh,

15:20.287 --> 15:22.289
me, Mayor Lavon Hayes,

15:22.322 --> 15:24.958
and I-I can't wait
to meet you, too. (chuckles)

15:24.992 --> 15:26.026
Converse mayor to mayor.

15:26.059 --> 15:26.859
My English is not so good.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.062
Uh, not so good at all,
I'm afraid,

15:29.096 --> 15:30.397
but, uh...

15:30.430 --> 15:33.400
for a mayor,
you are tres handsome.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.069
Uh... Likewise, uh...

15:36.103 --> 15:37.470
I mean, you-you are very
beautiful. (laughs)

15:37.504 --> 15:39.072
And-And very smart.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.474
And-And excellent
in all you do...

15:41.508 --> 15:42.342
I'm sure.

15:42.375 --> 15:46.179
I wish I could understand,
but, uh...

15:46.213 --> 15:47.180
Ah, well,

15:47.214 --> 15:48.715
enchante, monsieur.

15:48.748 --> 15:52.085
Yeah. Bye.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.086
(computer beeps)

15:53.120 --> 15:53.920
(whoops)

15:55.322 --> 15:57.424
Mayor Hayes, no offense,
but it's clear,

15:57.457 --> 16:00.460
if you wanna tap that, you're
gonna have to learn the lingo.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.329
That is not... wha...

16:02.362 --> 16:04.097
What are they teaching
in BlueBell's schools?

16:05.232 --> 16:06.266
No, no, no, look, look,

16:06.299 --> 16:08.168
I just want to make a good
impression for the town.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.269
For the, for the country.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.771
Sure you do.
Maybe one of y'all
could teach me French.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.541
You should get a CD,
 apprenez Ã  parler FranÃ§ais.

16:14.574 --> 16:18.011
Apprehend a,
a par-parlor France.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.446
(laughing)
Yeah, you'd
better start now.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.248
Okay.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.217
(radio static)

16:24.251 --> 16:26.253
(floorboards creaking)

16:31.524 --> 16:34.027
(screaming)

16:34.061 --> 16:37.230
ZOE: Okay, so just some
ginger ale, some crackers

16:37.264 --> 16:39.299
once she starts feeling better.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.034
Okay.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.471
Oh... Hey, Brick,
I have to go.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.440
I'm so sorry to leave you here
with all these sick kids, but

16:47.474 --> 16:50.343
it's Joel's only free window
for the next two weeks.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.611
Yeah, yeah.
Just be back by Monday morning.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.049
Zoe, you know what,
you should go.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.517
You're late and you're
gonna miss your flight.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.052
Are you okay?

16:59.086 --> 17:00.620
I don't think
I'm going anywhere.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.601
Good morning, beautiful friend.

17:14.634 --> 17:15.602
(laughs)

17:15.635 --> 17:18.137
Good morning, beautiful cousin.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.406
Wade.
Ow!

17:19.439 --> 17:21.141
Bonjour,

17:21.174 --> 17:22.809
a-apprenze FranÃ§ais.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.044
(speaking French)

17:26.146 --> 17:29.082
Bonjour, a-apprenze FranÃ§ais.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.584
(chuckles)
Keep pluggin', pal.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.853
You seem to be in a good mood.

17:33.886 --> 17:34.854
'Cause you're
gettin' laid tonight.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.156
Wade.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.424
But yes, after a long,
long month,

17:37.457 --> 17:38.425
Joel's coming for the weekend.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.627
(overlapping chatter)

17:40.660 --> 17:42.095
No, no, no, no, no.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.830
Joel is spending
the entire weekend with me.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.299
We have a ton of stuff
to do for the house.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.234
Okay, 'cause tonight

17:47.267 --> 17:49.602
we are shopping for
curtains and a bed,

17:49.636 --> 17:51.304
and we are picking out
our closet design.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.572
And then tomorrow we're
picking out wood panels

17:52.605 --> 17:54.307
and bathroom fixtures,
and then tomorrow night

17:54.341 --> 17:56.209
we're going to paint
samples on the wall

17:56.243 --> 17:58.445
of our house and have a picnic
in what will be our dining room.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.512
So we can decide what color

17:59.546 --> 18:01.148
we want to spend the rest
of our lives looking at.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.315
(overlapping chatter)

18:02.349 --> 18:04.584
Well, I think it sounds
wonderful, Zoe.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.585
It's very romantic.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.519
I love having another girl here.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.855
Anyway, Joel and I
will make an appearance

18:08.888 --> 18:09.856
at breakfast on Sunday.

18:09.889 --> 18:10.857
You will see him then.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.459
(phone chiming)
Whoa.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.194
It's him.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.230
Hey, Joel. I'm so excited.
Where are you?

18:17.264 --> 18:20.333
Layover in Denver.
It's-It's snowing.

18:20.367 --> 18:23.136
There are no more planes
taking off tonight.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.204
I'm just, I'm not going
to be able to get in

18:24.237 --> 18:25.338
until tomorrow afternoon.

18:25.372 --> 18:26.606
I'm so sorry.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.908
No. It's, it's okay.
I'll-I'll see you then.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.144
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

18:33.913 --> 18:36.349
Uh, yeah... you can forget
the pancake breakfast.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.254
Dash?
Hmm?

18:41.288 --> 18:43.390
I was thinking for
the musical this year,

18:43.423 --> 18:45.192
we should do My Fair Lady.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.494
You would make
a stellar Henry Higgins.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.396
Well, indeed I would.
(laughs)

18:49.429 --> 18:52.899
And I think I could
convince Shelby to play Eliza.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.434
I mean, you know,
she is the best singer

18:54.467 --> 18:55.402
this town's ever seen.
(laughs)
But-But Shelby's off

18:55.435 --> 18:57.937
with the lieutenant
governor in the capital.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.606
But now our next best
thing is Crickett,

18:59.639 --> 19:01.474
who happens to be
married to Stanley.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.675
I see.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.277
Who just bought the men
of the Owl Society

19:04.311 --> 19:05.645
those brand-new vacuums.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.680
His brother owns
a vacuum store.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.650
Are-Are you telling me that
I'm gonna lose MOTY to Stanley?

19:10.683 --> 19:12.519
Well, they come with
a new HEPA filter.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.188
A lot of allergies
in the Owls.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.923
Oh... I have to go.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.658
Well...

19:18.691 --> 19:20.327
Have you heard?

19:20.360 --> 19:23.396
The new ownership
of Fancie's is a disaster.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.398
George and Lemon's
nonstop fighting

19:25.432 --> 19:27.434
made three servers
quit yesterday.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.702
People say they actually
 miss Lily Anne.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.638
More servers quit?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.640
Well, the, the opening
is a week away!

19:33.673 --> 19:35.942
Apparently their fighting's
gotten so bad...

19:35.975 --> 19:37.577
even Crickett and Stanley quit.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.449
Thanks, Murphy.
Enjoy the game, bro!

19:42.482 --> 19:43.550
Next brewsky's on me.
(laughs)

19:45.017 --> 19:46.419
Hey, you know...

19:46.453 --> 19:48.388
Murphy, I'm sorry about
Lemon. She... (laughs)

19:48.421 --> 19:49.422
She had a stroke last week.

19:49.456 --> 19:52.225
Oh, that happened to my grandma.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.527
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.762
How dare you apologize for me?

19:55.795 --> 19:57.564
Well, Lemon,

19:57.597 --> 19:59.699
"bro," "brewskies."
You don't talk like that,

19:59.732 --> 20:00.700
it's insulting.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.369
I speak their language.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.470
Those vendors happen to love me.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.472
I would know because I have
run a restaurant before.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.539
Oh, here we go
with that again!

20:06.573 --> 20:09.442
Guess what. Those vendors,
they do not "love" you.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.411
They tolerate you because
you give them business.

20:11.444 --> 20:14.481
And because I'm constantly
apologizing for your behavior

20:14.514 --> 20:16.383
like I did when we took
that trip to Mexico.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.784
Just because I was
speaking Spanish!

20:17.817 --> 20:19.486
It was insulting!

20:19.519 --> 20:20.553
I was blending in!

20:20.587 --> 20:22.255
In Mexico, they speak espaÃ±ol.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.457
They don't speak "ethspanol"!
Okay. You know what?

20:24.491 --> 20:25.992
I was adding some
continental flair.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.660
(lisping): Because that
is how they speak in Spain.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.262
(lisping):
Well it was painful.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.998
BOTH:
How could I forget
how annoying you are?!

20:32.031 --> 20:33.199
What's up, guys?

20:33.232 --> 20:35.668
Wade, he's driving me crazy!
Wade, she's driving me crazy!

20:35.702 --> 20:36.869
It's so embarrassing
what she does!

20:36.903 --> 20:38.371
He's so patronizing!
The way she talks
to the vendors!

20:38.405 --> 20:39.472
And you know they hate it!
You know

20:39.506 --> 20:40.707
the vendors adore me!
You know it doesn't work, man!

20:40.740 --> 20:43.376
I so told you that working
together was a bad idea.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.477
So cut the crap.

20:44.511 --> 20:45.712
Look around you, all right.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.780
Your restaurant opens in a week
and it ain't half-finished.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.782
Now you both have sunk a bunch
of money into this enterprise.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.584
So if I were you,
I'd stop arguing

20:51.618 --> 20:52.885
and maybe start working
a little bit.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.322
You're right.
You got a point.
I got my own restaurant to run,

20:55.355 --> 20:57.624
so if you don't mind,
sayonara and good luck.
No, Wade, you cannot leave.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.759
No, you cannot leave.
You cannot leave us alone.
This is the first time in a week

20:59.792 --> 21:01.528
that we haven't been
at each other's throats.
Please, please, Wade.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.431
What? You want me to sit around
here and be y'all's buffer?

21:04.464 --> 21:05.532
That would be awesome, actually.
That is a great idea.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.399
No!

21:07.667 --> 21:11.671
Y'all do need a buffer.
I'll see what I can do.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.409
She's turned my office
into a hardware store.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.811
Oh, you were right
to call me.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.316
Zoe?
Hmm?

21:23.350 --> 21:24.317
What are you doing?

21:24.351 --> 21:25.385
Oh, there's more flight delays,

21:25.418 --> 21:27.320
so Joel isn't getting in
till late tomorrow night.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.088
And then six hours later,
he has to turn

21:29.121 --> 21:30.156
right back around,
which means we only have

21:30.189 --> 21:32.359
six hours to figure out
all the things going into

21:32.392 --> 21:33.460
our house
for always and forever.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.761
So I bought a bunch of choices,

21:34.794 --> 21:36.596
and I was gonna put them
in the house,

21:36.629 --> 21:38.565
but the cement was still wet.
So I'm holding them here

21:38.598 --> 21:40.467
so we can pick as soon
as he arrives. What?

21:40.500 --> 21:43.370
Nothing.
That's perfectly sound.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.338
Fix it.
Big Z,

21:45.372 --> 21:48.341
this is only the first
visit out of many.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.343
You don't have to do
all this stuff today.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.077
Yes, I do.

21:51.110 --> 21:54.347
Joel and I are growing apart.

21:54.381 --> 21:57.116
I can feel it, okay?
So I have to show him how great

21:57.149 --> 22:00.553
our future in BlueBell
is going to be.

22:00.587 --> 22:01.488
Okay.

22:01.521 --> 22:02.689
Now if you'll excuse me,

22:02.722 --> 22:03.823
I have to go pick up
some bathtubs.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.592
Zoe...

22:07.494 --> 22:12.799
Poivre fillet deux.
 Donc erronÃ©e.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.767
Two pepper fillets? Erroneous?

22:14.801 --> 22:17.704
No-no. I meant to say,
"poor misguided girl."

22:17.737 --> 22:21.608
Oh. Pauvre fille douce,
 si erronÃ©e.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.844
Yes, I'm fluent in French.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.480
See, you think a skill like that
would sway the Owls Club

22:27.514 --> 22:29.582
Man of the Year contest,
but no, no, no.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.818
You know, as mayor, I hold
some sway with the Owls.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.154
And I really need
to learn French.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.424
So how about you and I
help each other out?

22:37.457 --> 22:38.858
(chuckles)

22:47.634 --> 22:50.603
You're here!
I missed you.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.939
Oh, my God,
you're four hours late!

22:52.972 --> 22:55.442
I noticed. We sat on the runway,
no snacks.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.643
I'm-I'm exhausted.
Well, we don't even

22:56.676 --> 22:58.878
have time to look
at all the stuff I got

22:58.911 --> 23:00.447
for the house.
Could you maybe

23:00.480 --> 23:01.514
change your return trip?

23:01.548 --> 23:03.750
I've got breakfast
with Soderbergh,

23:03.783 --> 23:05.418
and it's really important,
or I would.

23:05.452 --> 23:06.453
You know that, right?

23:06.486 --> 23:08.154
Yeah. No, right, of course.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.757
Well, we have, like,
an hour and a half.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.459
You want to get some
dinner around here?

23:12.492 --> 23:13.593
We can shop for fixtures online.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.863
Yeah, or-or maybe we could
just make out in your car.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.766
I like the way you think,
my friend.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.434
(chuckles)

23:21.468 --> 23:22.702
(horn beeps)

23:22.735 --> 23:24.471
JOEL:
Oh, hang on, that's
not gonna work.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.473
What, are you okay?
Yeah, you come over here.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.740
Yeah, okay. Oh!

23:27.774 --> 23:29.476
Ow, ow.

23:31.478 --> 23:32.745
Oh!
I'm sorry! Sorry.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.581
No, it's okay.
It's okay...

23:34.614 --> 23:36.549
Sorry. You all right?

23:36.583 --> 23:37.917
Oh!
Yeah. Ow! Oh!

23:37.950 --> 23:39.919
Just... Oh, geez.
Are you all right?

23:39.952 --> 23:41.588
Uh, yeah.
I don't think

23:41.621 --> 23:43.690
the Prius is ideally designed
for this sort of thing.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.492
Yeah, I think you're right.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.826
I'm gonna try
and get out.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.828
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.565
(grunts)

23:52.599 --> 23:53.566
(sighs)

23:57.804 --> 24:00.807
You know, I probably have
to get back to the gate.

24:00.840 --> 24:04.611
Anyway, I am,
I'm starving.

24:04.644 --> 24:08.915
I need to get something to eat
before my next 11-hour journey.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.518
I'm sorry.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.555
*

24:23.530 --> 24:24.731
I love you.

24:24.764 --> 24:27.634
I love you, too.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.871
*

24:34.006 --> 24:35.642
(sighs)

24:43.983 --> 24:46.553
(sobs)

25:02.902 --> 25:05.638
Wow, I take it the Frenchies
are finally arriving tonight?

25:05.672 --> 25:11.878
Oui, mes ami. J'attends avec
 impatience leur arrivÃ©e

25:11.911 --> 25:14.046
Oh. Viva la France.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.884
Nice! Tonight's
gonna be awesome.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.786
17 of our visitors
are male.

25:20.820 --> 25:21.788
Ah, bonjour,

25:21.821 --> 25:24.090
mon professeur prÃ©fÃ©rÃ©.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.092
Oh, c'est bon.
 Bonnes nouvelles!
 Bonnes nouvelles!

25:26.125 --> 25:28.761
Dash dit que les
 Hiboux se penchent

25:28.795 --> 25:29.896
vers moi.

25:29.929 --> 25:30.930
Bon.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.899
No, I didn't get that.

25:32.932 --> 25:35.301
Dash says he's
in the lead for MOTY.

25:35.334 --> 25:36.335
Congratulations.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.906
Oh, as we say en FranÃ§ais,
"Aw, yeah!"

25:39.939 --> 25:41.007
(both laugh)

25:45.144 --> 25:47.780
Hi, Zoe.

25:47.814 --> 25:49.749
Are those
your pajamas?
(clears throat)

25:49.782 --> 25:51.918
They're really fashionable.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.920
Haven't see you
in a while.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.656
You want to join me
for some pancakes?

25:56.689 --> 25:58.625
No, thanks.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.793
Hey, can I, um,
just get a coffee?

26:00.827 --> 26:01.861
Black coffee?

26:01.894 --> 26:03.930
All right, but you gotta
give me a smile, sunshine.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.698
I'll go to the Butter Stick.

26:12.705 --> 26:16.375
Meatball, tell George
to maybe stop tasting
all the appetizers

26:16.408 --> 26:18.144
and start polishing
the silverware.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.713
Yes.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.682
Hey, Meatball,
can you tell Lemon

26:22.715 --> 26:23.950
to get back
in the kitchen?

26:23.983 --> 26:25.051
Marcel's having
another breakdown

26:25.084 --> 26:26.719
'cause she changed
the menu again!

26:27.920 --> 26:30.657
Yes. But first, George,
please polish the silverware.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.692
I know.

26:32.725 --> 26:33.960
(clears throat)

26:33.993 --> 26:35.127
Yes, yes, I heard.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.830
Great! Well, that's
the end of my shift.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.699
So, good luck.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.801
Can't wait for the big
opening tonight.

26:41.834 --> 26:42.669
Wait-wait-wait-wait!

26:42.702 --> 26:44.170
Your replacement has
not gotten here yet.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.639
No, no, no, you cannot
leave us alone, please.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.841
No sweat, no sweat, I'm here,
GT, Lemon, I'm here.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.644
Peace.
Y'all can get to work.
Thank God.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.045
Thank you, Wally,
thank you, Meatball.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.416
I can't believe this buffer
system is working.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.219
They should definitely consider
trying it in the Middle East.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.392
So, you think the
finger's broken, Doc?

27:06.425 --> 27:08.127
Oh, it's broken.
But that's okay.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.196
I'm gonna tape it
to the other finger.

27:10.229 --> 27:13.833
Oh.
Yeah, it's gonna lean
on that finger.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.702
And that finger's
gonna support it.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.436
Want to know why?
Huh?

27:17.469 --> 27:20.006
(voice breaks):
Because it's right there
next to it,

27:20.039 --> 27:21.774
where it should be.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.876
Uh, could I maybe get
a second opinion?

27:23.910 --> 27:26.879
Either that or fire her.

27:26.913 --> 27:28.748
Dr. Hart, this is enough.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.683
You need to see Joel.

27:30.717 --> 27:33.152
I know. I'm going
there next week.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.187
Although I'm 90% sure
there'll be an earthquake.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.890
Which is why
you must go now.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.859
Get on the next flight.
Surprise him!

27:39.892 --> 27:41.694
Oh, you must.
You definitely must.

27:41.728 --> 27:43.730
ANNABETH:
Spontaneous

27:43.763 --> 27:45.164
and fun!

27:45.197 --> 27:47.266
Consider that an order.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.003
Thank you.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.208
Edward, welcome!
I hope you like what

27:56.242 --> 27:57.176
I've done
with the place.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.811
What we've done
with the place.

27:58.845 --> 28:01.714
They've both worked so hard.

28:01.748 --> 28:04.150
Well, you both have done
the legacy of Fancie's proud.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.118
Oh...
But what is that

28:06.152 --> 28:07.253
buffer pin about?

28:07.286 --> 28:09.756
Oh, oh, he, uh,
buffs the floor.

28:09.789 --> 28:10.923
That's why
it's so shiny.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.859
Ah.
If you'll excuse us.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.861
Thank you.
All right.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.199
I cannot believe
we really did it.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.968
No, me neither.
(chuckles)

28:22.001 --> 28:25.071
So, will you be going back
to full-time lawyering now?

28:25.104 --> 28:27.473
Yes. Um, however,
I will not be leaving you

28:27.506 --> 28:29.809
to run this place
all by your lonesome.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.210
I still will be involved

28:31.243 --> 28:33.079
in every single one
of the major decisions.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.214
Well, I guess we should hire
a full-time buffer, then.

28:35.247 --> 28:36.515
That is a given.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.084
Cheers to our success.

28:39.118 --> 28:42.154
(clears throat)
George?

28:42.188 --> 28:46.893
Oh, Connie. Hi.
Uh, welcome to Fancie's.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.961
Oh, I won't be eating here.

28:48.995 --> 28:51.898
I just came to tell you that
my client Lily Anne Lonergan

28:51.931 --> 28:53.800
will be suing the both of you

28:53.833 --> 28:54.801
for unlawful
intimidation tactics.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.268
Excuse me?
GEORGE:
This is just ridiculous.

28:56.302 --> 28:57.837
Lily Anne told me about

28:57.870 --> 28:59.205
the "ghost sounds"
that she heard.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.241
Well, maybe
the place is haunted.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.010
Maybe it is. Which is why

29:04.043 --> 29:07.546
I hired a crew to go in and
check the source of the noise.

29:07.579 --> 29:11.017
Lo and behold, they
found an MP3 player
in the wine rack.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.885
Could be humiliating

29:12.919 --> 29:14.821
to your law career, Tucky.

29:17.857 --> 29:20.259
(fanfare plays)

29:20.292 --> 29:23.896
* Allons enfants de la patrie

29:23.930 --> 29:27.900
* Le jour de gloire est arrivÃ©

29:27.934 --> 29:32.138
* Contre nous de la tyrannie

29:32.171 --> 29:35.808

29:35.842 --> 29:39.578

29:39.611 --> 29:46.052
* Entendez vous
dans les campagnes. *

29:48.054 --> 29:49.021
Bonsoir. I am Rose,

29:49.055 --> 29:51.257
and we are so, so excited
to have you guys here.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.160
Uh, bonsoir.
 Je suis Lavon Hayes,

29:54.193 --> 29:55.928
le maire de cette ville.

29:55.962 --> 29:58.030
Je m'appelle Jean Claude.

29:58.064 --> 30:00.266
I am the deputy mayor
of ClocheBleu.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.601
Thank you for having us.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.303
Nice to meet you.

30:04.336 --> 30:07.874
Uh, but, uh,
where is your mayor?

30:07.907 --> 30:09.608
You know, the one
with the not deputy,

30:09.641 --> 30:12.044
and the smile that
turns your insides out?

30:12.078 --> 30:15.181
She is tres busy
with her husband

30:15.214 --> 30:17.283
and children, and sent me.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.886
Oh. As the French say,

30:19.919 --> 30:22.855
les poop.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.092
(chuckles,
clears throat)

30:26.125 --> 30:29.195
*

30:36.102 --> 30:38.004
ACTOR:
Caesar doth decree that...

30:38.037 --> 30:39.171
Wait, what's the line again?

30:39.205 --> 30:40.406
Cut! Let's go again
right away.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.608
Joel!

30:42.641 --> 30:43.876
Zoe?

30:43.910 --> 30:45.978
Hi! Surprise!

30:46.012 --> 30:47.646
Best surprise ever!

30:47.679 --> 30:49.081
Hi!
Oh!

30:49.115 --> 30:50.883
Oh, my God,
it's so Hollywood here!

30:50.917 --> 30:52.318
Hey, I want
to introduce you.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.186
This is my producer,
Jeff Powell.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.222
Jeff, this is my
girlfriend, Zoe.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.357
You have a great look!
Have you ever considered acting?

30:58.390 --> 31:00.092
(laughs)
Oh, no, thanks.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.661
I think the idea of anyone
thinking I could be anything

31:02.694 --> 31:04.030
other than a doctor
is ridiculous.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.898
Has she heard the great news?

31:05.932 --> 31:07.233
Uh, no, actually, not yet.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.234
The movie's fast-tracked.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.336
And I'm not letting this
genius leave my side.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.437
(laughs)

31:11.470 --> 31:13.072
We're all going
to London in July.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.240
Hope you like
Great Britain, Zoe.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.342
Great Britain.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.411
With the, uh, queen
and the-the Europe?

31:19.445 --> 31:20.947
Yes.
Great.

31:22.448 --> 31:23.449
Britain!

31:25.084 --> 31:26.418
Great.

31:35.294 --> 31:36.262
(sighs)

31:36.295 --> 31:37.363
You're going to London

31:37.396 --> 31:38.931
instead of back
to BlueBell?

31:38.965 --> 31:39.865
Why didn't
you tell me?

31:39.898 --> 31:42.701
You know, look, we
just found out, and...

31:42.734 --> 31:44.136
and I didn't know
how to tell you.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.704
Well, how are we
gonna handle this?

31:45.737 --> 31:46.705
You can come
with me.

31:46.738 --> 31:47.706
You know,
come on,

31:47.739 --> 31:49.041
take a year off

31:49.075 --> 31:50.176
and just...
be with me.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.177
London's amazing.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.278
A year?

31:52.311 --> 31:53.412
I'm not allowed
to practice

31:53.445 --> 31:54.380
medicine in Europe.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.481
You know how insane

31:55.514 --> 31:56.983
that makes me.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.717
Plus, you're gonna be
on set all the time.

31:58.750 --> 31:59.718
I'm gonna be
all by myself.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.988
(sighs)

32:02.021 --> 32:03.289
You're right.

32:03.322 --> 32:06.092
And I-I know how much
BlueBell means to you.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.393
But...
(laughs painfully)

32:07.426 --> 32:08.494
I don't want
to make

32:08.527 --> 32:10.396
the choice between
my dream job

32:10.429 --> 32:11.430
and my dream girl.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.267
There is no choice.

32:15.301 --> 32:18.304
This is an amazing
opportunity for you

32:18.337 --> 32:19.972
and I don't want you
to give it up.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.173
You can't give it up.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.409
Well... I mean,
what does that mean?

32:23.442 --> 32:25.411
Is that another year
of long distance?

32:25.444 --> 32:28.180
We've had
enough trouble

32:28.214 --> 32:29.348
making it work
while you were here.

32:29.381 --> 32:32.018
I mean, think about
a transatlantic
relationship.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.988
Well, yeah, but...

32:36.022 --> 32:37.223
what other choice
do we have?

32:39.525 --> 32:41.227
*

32:48.467 --> 32:49.535
Mayor Hayes!

32:49.568 --> 32:51.737
Ah. May I just
say, uh,

32:51.770 --> 32:54.206
your town, it's...
it's lovely.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.042
You know, we are
having a super time.

32:56.075 --> 32:56.975
Oh, great.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.477
That is good to hear,
you know?
Yeah.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.479
And that's all
that really matters.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.114
Yeah. Oh, uh...

33:02.148 --> 33:04.350
I realize that,
uh, this is

33:04.383 --> 33:06.418
clichÃ© of me,
but, uh...

33:06.452 --> 33:09.021
there is a pretty girl
I have my eyeballs on.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.156
And, uh...
Oh-ho-ho.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.124
...I was hoping that you could
provide an introduction.

33:12.158 --> 33:13.525
Who?

33:13.559 --> 33:14.560
Uh...

33:19.398 --> 33:22.034
Her?

33:22.068 --> 33:22.968
Yeah. Whew!

33:23.001 --> 33:26.072
Yeah, in America,
we introduce ourselves.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.476
Well, it is
official.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.378
Signed, sealed,
delivered.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.146
Lily Anne is back
running Fancie's.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.148
Yep.
(sighs)

33:36.182 --> 33:38.084
Here's to a lifetime
of songs about me,

33:38.117 --> 33:39.151
and hoping that

33:39.185 --> 33:41.820
Lily Anne hates you enough
to spread the wealth.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.189
Well, we deserve it.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.256
Yep.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.193
Mmm.
Ooh...

33:47.226 --> 33:48.194
Another, please.

33:48.227 --> 33:49.395
Okay.
(laughs)

33:49.428 --> 33:51.197
I do gotta tell you,
though, I feel like

33:51.230 --> 33:52.298
we dodged a bullet.
'Cause you and me

33:52.331 --> 33:54.200
working together?
Bad idea.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.101
Terrible idea.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.402
Uh-huh.
So terrible.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.504
It's like... everything
that I tolerated about you

33:58.537 --> 34:00.239
for the past 15 years
just started to drive

34:00.272 --> 34:01.473
me insane again.
Like the way that

34:01.507 --> 34:03.409
you clear your throat
every time that you
walk into a room.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.244
Or the way you
clickety-clack your nails

34:05.277 --> 34:06.545
on every possible surface.
(laughing):
Oh, yeah?

34:06.578 --> 34:08.313
Well, how about
how stubborn you are?

34:08.347 --> 34:09.447
Oh, how stubborn I am?
Yeah.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.221
Again?
Mm-hmm.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.290
* We wrote that song together

34:18.324 --> 34:20.292
* In the Rammer Jammer bar

34:20.326 --> 34:22.261
* Then we traveled together

34:22.293 --> 34:24.330
* Down that road really far

34:24.362 --> 34:26.331
* You abandoned me

34:26.364 --> 34:27.833
* When push came to shove

34:27.866 --> 34:29.534
* I'm not a lawyer

34:29.568 --> 34:31.837
* But I object to your love

34:31.870 --> 34:33.472
So she's afraid
of, um...

34:33.505 --> 34:35.174
kittens,
uh, hammocks,

34:35.206 --> 34:36.175
carbon monoxide
poisoning...

34:36.208 --> 34:37.509
Smokers,
laryngitis,

34:37.543 --> 34:39.645
Norwegians,
oranges, um...

34:39.678 --> 34:41.213
Hey, Lily Anne.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.315
Hello, scourge of the earth.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.451
Hey, I wanted
to introduce you

34:45.484 --> 34:46.452
to my girlfriend,

34:46.485 --> 34:49.188
the lovely
Miss Vivian Wilkes.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.322
You know...
mend fences and whatever.

34:51.357 --> 34:53.125
Welcome back
to town.

34:54.260 --> 34:57.129
Well, I'm gonna look around.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.231
See what you got going on here.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.267
(whispering):
Lead with
carbon monoxide.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.136
Vivian...

35:04.170 --> 35:06.272
Hard name to rhyme.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.639
I could try and
scare you away,

35:07.673 --> 35:09.375
but I figured I would
appeal to your talent.

35:09.408 --> 35:11.343
Hmm.
Singing
songs about

35:11.377 --> 35:12.378
the people who
live here...

35:12.411 --> 35:13.312
that'll be funny
for a while.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.547
But people aren't
gonna keep coming around

35:15.581 --> 35:17.583
to see their friends
and neighbors
get dumped on.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.252
It's just a bit of...
business advice.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.555
Also, you should know

35:23.589 --> 35:25.657
that I'm a part of
the Norwegian Wilkes clan.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.259
We raise cats
and oranges,

35:27.293 --> 35:29.261
and our cars have
a lot of exhaust.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.163
Consider this your
one and only warning.

35:31.197 --> 35:32.231
Ready to hit
the road, babe?

35:32.264 --> 35:33.265
Absolutely.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.502
Uh... (sniffs)

35:43.209 --> 35:44.176
Come here.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.177
Mmm...
(chuckles)

35:45.211 --> 35:46.912
Oh...

35:46.945 --> 35:48.414
I just want you
to know that...

35:48.447 --> 35:50.382
you changed
my life.

35:50.416 --> 35:51.917
You know?
You made me so happy.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.252
Whoa, hold on
a second.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.953
Don't talk about me
in the past tense.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.256
We agreed this
is just a break.

35:57.289 --> 35:58.257
It's not over.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.291
Okay.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.227
I should go,
I don't want to
miss my flight.

36:01.260 --> 36:02.228
Hey.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.462
It's just a break.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.496
Just while I do the movie,

36:04.530 --> 36:05.531
and then as soon
as it's finished,

36:05.564 --> 36:06.465
I'm gonna come
back to BlueBell.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.534
When it's finished,
you are going to be

36:08.567 --> 36:10.736
a big screenwriter, and
you're gonna move here,

36:10.769 --> 36:13.439
or back to New York,
and go on with your life.

36:13.472 --> 36:17.276
No, I am coming back,
I promise you.

36:17.309 --> 36:18.277
This is not good-bye,

36:18.310 --> 36:19.611
it's just a break.

36:19.645 --> 36:21.313
Okay?

36:33.592 --> 36:35.261
Okay.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.996
Well...

36:38.029 --> 36:41.767
good... break,
Joel.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.569
Good break.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.637
(chuckles)

36:45.671 --> 36:46.672
Bye.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.342
*

37:18.504 --> 37:20.372
ROSE:
Good morning, tuit le monde.

37:20.406 --> 37:21.473
(speaks French)

37:21.507 --> 37:23.509
Every year, our local men's
club, the BlueBell Owls,

37:23.542 --> 37:25.043
chooses a Man of the Year.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.177
It's kind of like
your Legion of Honors medal,

37:26.211 --> 37:28.614
but from a bunch of middle-aged
men who like to hoot.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.616
(men hooting)

37:30.649 --> 37:31.817
I don't see
how anyone

37:31.850 --> 37:34.420
can look so glum on
such a fine, fine day.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.823
How's that
for a reason?

37:37.856 --> 37:39.725
And he ran
the missed field goal

37:39.758 --> 37:41.493
all the way back
to win the game!
Oh!

37:41.527 --> 37:43.629
Because Auburn is
a far superior team.

37:43.662 --> 37:46.598
AnnaBeth,
I could listen to you

37:46.632 --> 37:48.600
talk about this
American football

37:48.634 --> 37:49.735
until the end of time.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.504
Well, are...
are you hitting on me?

37:52.538 --> 37:54.506
Because I just...
well, it's just, I got

37:54.540 --> 37:56.742
out of a serious
relationship.
Oh, dear.

37:56.775 --> 37:57.776
(hooting)

37:57.809 --> 37:59.878
(applause)

38:05.851 --> 38:08.320
DASH:
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:08.354 --> 38:09.621
this year's Man of the Year

38:09.655 --> 38:11.557
is, uh, a true inspiration.

38:11.590 --> 38:15.060
His dedication to his career
has inspired us all

38:15.093 --> 38:16.662
to make our own work
a little bit better.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.464
It took us a while

38:18.497 --> 38:21.400
to get used to... his ways,
but, um...

38:21.433 --> 38:22.368
(chuckles)

38:22.401 --> 38:24.069
...he slowly wormed his way
into our hearts

38:24.102 --> 38:25.771
with his kindness,

38:25.804 --> 38:27.573
his humor, and his sheer will.

38:27.606 --> 38:30.842
And we also love the way
he loved our own Dr. Hart.

38:30.876 --> 38:34.346
Our Man of the Year...

38:34.380 --> 38:36.348
Mr. Joel Stephens.

38:36.382 --> 38:37.383
(applause)

38:39.451 --> 38:40.819
Oh, man.

38:40.852 --> 38:43.355
I am so sorry.

38:43.389 --> 38:44.890
DASH:
As we all know,

38:44.923 --> 38:46.425
Joel is off in Hollywood...

38:46.458 --> 38:49.094
(laughs)
...becoming famous.

38:49.127 --> 38:51.497
So is there anyone here
who will accept on his behalf?

38:54.533 --> 38:55.634
Anyone here...

38:55.667 --> 38:57.436
to accept on his behalf?

38:57.469 --> 38:59.538
ZOE:
I will.

38:59.571 --> 39:00.772
(applause)

39:08.414 --> 39:09.515
Thanks.

39:09.548 --> 39:13.719
I-I know just how much
this award would mean to Joel.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.954
He really grew to love it here.

39:17.623 --> 39:19.725
And-and we loved him.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.793
A lot.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.829
So much.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.534
But you know, um...
things happen.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.604
And opportunities arise.

39:34.973 --> 39:40.746
And he says that
he's coming back, but...

39:40.779 --> 39:41.980
we know that he's not.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.685
Um...

39:46.718 --> 39:48.787
(choked up):
...he would be so proud of this.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.859
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take this home,

39:53.892 --> 39:55.827
you know,
so I-I can remember him.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.498
Thank you so much.

39:59.531 --> 40:01.767
(applause)

40:01.800 --> 40:03.969
DASH:
Thank you, everybody.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.971
That concludes our presentation.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.205
Did you know?

40:07.238 --> 40:09.575
No.

40:09.608 --> 40:10.642
Poor Zoe.

40:10.676 --> 40:11.977
Poor Zoe?

40:14.880 --> 40:16.782
Poor Zoe.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.817
And-and
where's Lemon?

40:18.850 --> 40:19.918
She ought
to be here.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.553
She must be
with George.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.489
I should go find 'em,
tell 'em the good news.

40:23.522 --> 40:24.422
'Cause, you know,
it's official.

40:24.456 --> 40:25.991
Babs just told me.
They got Fancie's back.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.226
Oh.
(chuckles)

40:28.259 --> 40:30.462
*

40:32.698 --> 40:33.699
(quietly):
Oh, God.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.977
*

40:52.851 --> 40:54.853
(knocking at door)

40:56.622 --> 40:57.623
It's me.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.793
Brought ice cream.

41:01.827 --> 41:02.861
(knocking at door, door opens)

41:02.894 --> 41:04.262
WADE:
I brought fries.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.030
Tissues.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.031
Hugs.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.032
Move over.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.634
(knocking at door)

41:08.667 --> 41:09.968
Leave room for me.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.238
I brought a breakup pie.

41:13.271 --> 41:14.706
Ooh! Whoa.

41:14.740 --> 41:15.874
Is that
breakup pie?

41:15.907 --> 41:17.275
(laughs)
Good.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.044
Uh, Lemon's not
here, is she?
Okay, good.

41:19.077 --> 41:21.647
(George laughs)

41:21.680 --> 41:22.881
Hey...

41:22.914 --> 41:24.916
You gonna be okay?

41:26.017 --> 41:28.620
Eventually,
yeah.

41:28.654 --> 41:29.955
I got all of you guys.

41:31.289 --> 41:32.624
How could I not be?

41:32.658 --> 41:33.859
Aw...
Yeah.

41:33.892 --> 41:35.861
That bed is
so soft...

41:35.894 --> 41:37.729
(talking, laughing)

41:37.763 --> 41:38.964
We brought
cake.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.599
And you...
Yes.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.634
We brought cookies.
