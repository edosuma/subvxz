00:02.001 --> 00:04.420
Previously on Lost:

00:04.963 --> 00:07.590
- I think I'm all right.
- I told you I'd take care of you.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.967
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You're quite welcome.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.804
- Listen to me.
- Sayid.

00:13.389 --> 00:15.807
- We're not alone.
- Has anyone seen Ethan?

00:15.891 --> 00:17.684
He took off on the path to the beach.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.311
- Where's Charlie?
- He went after Claire.

00:20.396 --> 00:23.147
Footprints, three distinct sets,
all over the place.

00:23.232 --> 00:24.649
I think they've been taken.

00:25.150 --> 00:29.404
Claire. All they wanted was Claire.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.531
Walt!

00:42.960 --> 00:44.627
Have you seen Claire's bags?

00:44.712 --> 00:46.921
- You seen my son?
- You seen her bags?

00:47.005 --> 00:48.381
- Claire's?
- Her luggage.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.008
No one seems to know
what's happened to it.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.302
I don't know.
I'm just looking for Walt.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.347
Oh. Got it. Sorry.
I've not seen him.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.227
Hey, Jack. You seen my boy
when you were out there?

01:01.311 --> 01:03.062
No. He was at the caves.

01:03.147 --> 01:06.190
Yeah, he took his dog for a walk.
Told him to stay close as usual.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.776
You listened to your old man
when you were ten?

01:08.861 --> 01:12.530
Yeah, I listened.
Maybe a little too well.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.074
Yo, dudes,
got a new tourney lined up.

01:15.159 --> 01:18.327
We're playing for deodorant sticks.
You dawgs up for some golf?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.747
I gotta go find my kid.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.540
Hey, if Walt shows up,

01:22.624 --> 01:24.917
you tell him to stay right here
until I get back.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.544
You got it.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.591
- He seems to hate it, doesn't he?
- What?

01:31.675 --> 01:33.426
Being a dad.

01:33.510 --> 01:37.013
No, it's just a lot of hard work.

01:41.477 --> 01:42.810
Nah, he hates it.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.917
This is the one.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.336
This is definitely my baby's crib.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.049
Beautiful.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.010
It'll look great in the alley
we'll be living in.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.888
- This is three months rent.
- What? It's not three...

02:20.224 --> 02:22.809
Don't you want the best for this kid?

02:22.893 --> 02:25.645
I know you're excited,
but we can't afford this.

02:25.729 --> 02:29.315
Our baby in this crib.
Come on. That's a happy kid.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.363
I talked to Andy. He said he can
throw some work my way.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.698
- Construction? What about your art?
- No.

02:37.783 --> 02:41.327
I'm not giving it up. I'll take a break
until you finish law school.

02:41.411 --> 02:45.790
Pass the bar, get hired by some
fancy-ass, high-paying law firm.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.543
Somebody's got it all figured.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.795
I'll get back to painting eventually.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.714
Meanwhile, you can support me and Walt

02:53.799 --> 02:57.301
in the manner to which
we'll soon become accustomed.

02:57.386 --> 02:58.970
"Walt," huh?

02:59.054 --> 03:02.598
I'd like to do that, you know?
Name him after my dad.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.520
Walter.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.022
Walter Lloyd.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.566
Lloyd?

03:11.650 --> 03:13.943
Oh, all right. That's why
you won't marry me.

03:14.027 --> 03:17.864
It's not that marriage is too prosaic,
you want him to have your last name.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.700
Hey, you want me
to agree to "Walter" or what?

03:34.798 --> 03:37.174
- Man, I suck.
- You can do better than that.

03:37.259 --> 03:40.469
- You might wanna take it easy on him.
- See this knot, Walt?

03:41.638 --> 03:43.890
I want you to aim for it. Right here.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.060
Focus on it. All right?

03:48.145 --> 03:50.354
Picture it in your mind's eye.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.898
You know what that is, right?

03:51.982 --> 03:56.235
- A picture in your head.
- Right. Do it again, but see it.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.280
See it before you do it.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.867
Visualize the path. See it.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.091
- Whoa.
- Yes!

04:20.177 --> 04:21.636
I knew you had it in you.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.306
It was weird. I actually saw it
in my mind like it was real.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.934
- Who's to say it wasn't?
- Hey!

04:28.018 --> 04:29.644
What the hell is going on?

04:29.728 --> 04:31.187
- Gimme that.
- But I...

04:31.271 --> 04:33.773
- Take Vincent and go back to camp.
- Mr. Locke...

04:33.857 --> 04:35.399
Now, little man.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.997
- You gave my boy a knife?
- You should've seen...

04:50.082 --> 04:54.293
Don't tell me what I should've seen.
Back home, I'd call the police on you!

04:54.378 --> 04:56.212
Encouraging a kid to sneak away,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.965
- giving him a knife?
- Walt knows his own mind.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.134
- Don't talk to me like you know him!
- You need to calm down.

05:02.219 --> 05:05.221
You keep playing my son against me
and I'm gonna have a...

05:08.433 --> 05:10.893
The man said "calm down."

05:12.938 --> 05:16.691
- What are you, his attack dog?
- Easy. You were waving the knife.

05:16.775 --> 05:19.610
He was just trying to make sure
you didn't hurt someone.

05:21.905 --> 05:25.866
Michael, I know it's been difficult
to bond with your son.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.661
You know why he's attached to me?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.663
Because I treat him like an adult.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.456
He's ten years old.

05:32.541 --> 05:35.042
He's been through
more than most people.

05:35.127 --> 05:38.629
You haven't spent enough time with him
to see it, but he's different.

05:39.506 --> 05:43.259
- What did you say?
- And we're not back home.

05:43.343 --> 05:47.179
As long as we're here I think he should
be allowed to realize his potential.

05:54.521 --> 05:58.274
You stay away from my son. And me.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.762
You're not taking him.
You're not taking my son.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.723
You can go if you want to,
but Walt stays with me.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.059
- I'm trying to have a discussion.
- You're not.

06:33.143 --> 06:37.396
You're talking about going to Amsterdam.
You and him. How is that a discussion?

06:37.481 --> 06:39.732
It's an offer,
and that's where the job is.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.150
You said you were happy.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.236
What about the legal clinic being
a good fit? You said that.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.155
This is a huge opportunity.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.241
I've wanted to do International Law.

06:49.326 --> 06:52.745
Am I supposed to be happy for you?
For your huge opportunity?

07:01.088 --> 07:03.839
We've talked about
taking some time apart.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.263
Look babe, I thought that was...

07:11.348 --> 07:13.599
Hey, we said a lot of things.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.352
You said you wanted to live on a boat.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.190
I still love you.

07:21.274 --> 07:25.861
You know I do, but we've been through
so much in such a short time.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.614
- Things...
- Babe, we got problems.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.534
That's what people have.
You wanna go to counseling?

07:31.618 --> 07:34.286
I'm down with that. Let's go. Right.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.587
Oh, man.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.174
You already took it, didn't you?

07:47.884 --> 07:49.927
The job.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.388
Yeah, I did.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.017
You haven't worked in months.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.478
Construction slows
in the winter, I told you.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.856
I can provide for him,
give him everything.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.316
Except for his dad.
He's not going with you!

08:04.401 --> 08:08.154
- You wanna argue about this?
- Hell yes. There are laws against this.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.989
We're not married.

08:10.073 --> 08:13.576
I'm his mother, and I'm employed.
Who's the court's gonna side with?

08:21.793 --> 08:24.753
This is not goodbye forever.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.844
I just...

08:31.928 --> 08:33.596
I need some time.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.454
Are you all right?

09:01.124 --> 09:03.751
I'm OK. Thanks.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.215
I just don't know how to talk to him.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.218
How to get him to,

09:12.302 --> 09:15.304
you know, understand I'm on his side.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.602
Locke says I should stop
treating him like a child.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.480
I missed his whole childhood, so...

09:30.111 --> 09:32.112
It just can't happen.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.990
What?

09:37.452 --> 09:39.536
He can't grow up here.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.542
He can't grow up in this place.

09:48.463 --> 09:52.591
Once I realized these equations were
coordinates, latitude and longitude,

09:52.676 --> 09:55.886
I assumed she was trying to determine
the location of the island.

09:55.971 --> 09:59.640
But it was incomplete,
her notations fragmented.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.475
Except for the fish song.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.813
- The what?
- When I lay the pages down like this,

10:07.941 --> 10:11.443
I realized it wasn't showing
the location of the island.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.573
I think it's a location on the island.
Specifically, here.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.951
So where are we?
In relation to the triangle?

10:19.035 --> 10:21.870
Well, the map is hardly at scale,
so I don't know.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.707
We're not even sure it's a map
of this island, are we?

10:25.375 --> 10:29.044
We're not. This may be the transmitter
sending out her distress call,

10:29.129 --> 10:31.630
- and its power source.
- What are we talking about?

10:31.715 --> 10:36.051
Another excuse to get chased down and
killed by whatever lives in that jungle?

10:36.553 --> 10:38.637
Guys, we can't keep doing this.

10:38.722 --> 10:42.725
Building water filtration systems,
playing golf, making a sweet home here.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.228
- We need to get off this island!
- You think any of us wanna be here?

10:46.313 --> 10:49.315
No. But I don't think anyone
wants to get off as much as I do.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.275
So, are you suggesting something?

10:51.359 --> 10:55.321
- Yeah. We build a raft.
- A raft?

10:55.405 --> 10:58.866
Look, don't say it like that.
We need a little optimism here.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.826
OK? We gotta do something, 'cause

11:00.910 --> 11:03.203
let's be honest, no one's coming.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.499
Those seats we took
off the fuselage, they float.

11:07.584 --> 11:11.712
And we got an axe.
And a whole bunch of trees, bamboo.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.840
- We can do this.
- The chances of surviving rough waters,

11:14.924 --> 11:17.926
- the odds of finding a shipping lane...
- And I get seasick.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.973
You know what? Great. Stay here.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.352
Grow old, good luck. But I'm doing this.
My son and I are leaving.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.438
Anybody that wants to help us build,
God bless you.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.485
Hey, Walt.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.279
Hey, come on.
I need your help with something.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.199
- I'm doing stuff.
- You're reading comics in Spanish,

12:22.283 --> 12:26.328
- and you don't read Spanish, man.
- I like the pictures.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.249
You like the art, huh?

12:30.333 --> 12:32.084
I guess so.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.256
You know, when I was your age,
maybe a little older,

12:37.340 --> 12:40.008
I traced comics.
Taught myself about perspective.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.428
You know what that is?
Perspective?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.767
- Hey.
- I said I need your help. Let's go.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.061
- Why do I have to come?
- I seen what happens

12:51.146 --> 12:53.188
when I don't keep an eye on you.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.112
- Let me talk to him.
- He's 21 months old,

13:00.196 --> 13:02.281
- he doesn't use the phone.
- I'll talk.

13:02.365 --> 13:05.117
I just want him to hear my voice.
I miss him.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.744
I know. Let me call you back.
This isn't a good time.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.621
- Honey, we gotta go?
- It's Michael.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.123
- Honey.
- I'm getting off.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.292
- Who's that?
- Let's talk tomorrow.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.961
What the hell is going on?

13:16.671 --> 13:18.088
Michael, listen.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.383
I've been seeing someone.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.635
What?

13:23.720 --> 13:25.387
Who?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.556
- Does it make any difference?
- Who is it?

13:28.057 --> 13:29.516
Brian Porter.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.145
- The guy who hired you?
- It wasn't like that before.

13:33.229 --> 13:36.148
When you said you needed
time to think, you were lying.

13:36.232 --> 13:39.151
- No, I did, and I realized...
- I'm coming to Amsterdam.

13:39.235 --> 13:42.321
- Don't. It's over between us.
- I'm not coming for you.

13:42.405 --> 13:45.407
I'm coming for Walt.
I'm getting my son back.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.583
Call an ambulance! Help me.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.177
Charlie?

14:05.261 --> 14:06.512
Hey.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.932
These are Claire's.
Who brought them here?

14:10.016 --> 14:13.602
- I did. What are you doing?
- I don't know where it is.

14:14.729 --> 14:17.856
- What?
- Claire's diary.

14:17.941 --> 14:21.568
She kept her diary in this pocket.
I know because I saw her put it there.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.072
Someone's taken it.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.407
What are we looking for again?

14:27.492 --> 14:29.409
Any piece of metal or plastic tubing.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.704
Anything that looks like
it'd work as a frame.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.208
- A frame for what?
- You'll see soon enough.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.919
Separate cushions, plastic, tarp.

14:39.003 --> 14:42.297
Put everything you find in
different piles so we can take stock.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.634
Am I being punished?

14:46.678 --> 14:49.429
You think working
with your old man is punishment?

14:49.514 --> 14:51.056
No, man.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.351
This is us taking control
of our destiny.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.230
Feels like punishment.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.065
Sawyer.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.282
- You know, I could just go inside.
- Trick or treat.

15:11.953 --> 15:15.080
- So, what are you two selling today?
- Where's Claire's diary?

15:15.164 --> 15:19.001
- Someone took it from her bag.
- Oh, I get it.

15:19.085 --> 15:22.796
Something goes missing and you figure
it's gotta be me that took it.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.464
Do you have the diary or not?

15:25.842 --> 15:27.634
- You mean this one?
- Give it to me.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.553
Now I'm not sure that's the best idea.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.973
Maybe Missy Claire
don't want you reading it.

15:33.057 --> 15:36.018
- I wasn't gonna read it.
- Curious what she wrote about you?

15:37.729 --> 15:39.187
You bastard. Did you read it?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.273
Good Literature's scarce around here.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.108
- He read it!
- Just give it to us.

15:43.192 --> 15:48.113
"Dear Diary, I'm getting really
freaked out by that has-been pop star.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.198
- I think he's stalking me."
- Sawyer!

15:50.283 --> 15:52.868
"Diary, the little Limey runt
just won't let up."

15:59.375 --> 16:01.376
- You hit like a ponce.
- Oh, yeah?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.128
All right, enough.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.507
You didn't really read it, did you?

16:07.592 --> 16:09.509
I just hadn't gotten around to it yet.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.912
I'm gonna get some water.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.705
Yeah, OK.

16:38.790 --> 16:39.998
Would you bring me some?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.668
Please?

16:42.752 --> 16:46.838
Please and thank you.
We gotta work on that.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.596
Hi. So you guys just gonna keep
coming back without any food?

16:56.307 --> 16:58.850
Hey, I'm serious.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.727
What's going on with you?

17:00.812 --> 17:02.896
Could you be acting any weirder?

17:02.980 --> 17:07.567
You've been a functioning bulimic
since junior high.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.404
I thought you'd be excited
about dropping a size or two.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.741
Since you're not having any luck
with the hunting,

17:14.826 --> 17:17.618
maybe you should help Michael.
He's building a raft.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.749
I was thinking I would help him out.
Finally get out of here.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.462
Why don't you help me?

17:31.092 --> 17:32.634
No thanks.

17:42.562 --> 17:46.356
Your father doesn't want us
spending time together.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.692
He's not the boss of me.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.318
But he's your father.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.906
And he cares about you
and you need to show him respect.

17:56.701 --> 18:00.662
I'm serious, Walt.
You're not to come to me anymore.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.750
Damn it! What is wrong with you?

18:05.543 --> 18:08.920
- I was just coming to see...
- I told you to stay away from my son!

18:09.005 --> 18:10.964
- I was...
- I don't want to hear you!

18:11.048 --> 18:13.258
I was giving him this pencil
to give to you.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.093
I thought you could use it.

18:16.262 --> 18:20.140
Consider it a peace offering.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.522
I catch you with my son again,
I'll kill you.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.959
- You're a jerk.
- What did you say to me?

18:48.044 --> 18:51.213
- He didn't do anything. He's my friend!
- He's not anymore.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.090
- I'm looking out for you.
- You never cared about me.

18:54.175 --> 18:56.092
- What?
- You showed up after Mom died.

18:56.177 --> 18:58.428
Where were you when
I was growing up? Nowhere!

18:58.513 --> 19:00.806
Listen, Walt. It's complicated.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.641
I don't care! You're not my father!

19:06.896 --> 19:08.814
You wanna hate me?

19:08.898 --> 19:11.608
You gonna punish me for something
I can't change? Fine.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.860
But you will listen to me.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.077
Now, you get over there,

19:23.371 --> 19:25.497
and you stay there.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.584
Now!

20:01.784 --> 20:05.537
- That's really wonderful.
- Oh, thanks.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.206
For my son. He's gonna be two next week.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.375
Yeah? I didn't know you have a kid.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.339
He lives in Amsterdam with his mom.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.717
Ever get to visit him?

20:18.801 --> 20:21.720
No, not yet.

20:21.804 --> 20:25.432
I had a little, you know,
run-in with a car.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.393
I never know what to write.

20:28.477 --> 20:32.355
- How about a joke?
- I don't know. What kinda joke?

20:32.440 --> 20:35.525
How about "What's black,
white and red all over?"

20:35.610 --> 20:38.778
- Yeah, a newspaper, right?
- "A penguin with a sunburn."

20:40.990 --> 20:42.657
- That's really dumb.
- Trust me.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.535
Mother of four talking here.
He'll get a kick out of it.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.583
Hello, Michael.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.010
Susan.

21:04.889 --> 21:08.934
Finally called Andy when I hadn't
heard from you in over two months.

21:09.727 --> 21:13.271
I had to hear about your accident
from him. You should've called me.

21:14.565 --> 21:18.610
Yeah, well, considering how
our last conversation went...

21:18.694 --> 21:21.655
I'm so sorry about that.

21:21.739 --> 21:25.158
- Hey, did you bring Walt?
- No. He's at home.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.286
Home.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.704
With Brian?

21:34.126 --> 21:36.753
So, what are you doing here, anyway?

21:36.837 --> 21:39.506
I came to see you.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.800
So, I look pretty good, huh?

21:41.884 --> 21:43.635
Not that bad.

21:44.679 --> 21:47.180
They say you're expected
to make a full recovery.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.474
Yeah, after a year of physical therapy.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.934
A year.

21:52.895 --> 21:55.522
- I'm covering all your medical costs.
- What?

21:55.606 --> 21:58.149
I've already spoken
to the hospital administrator

21:58.234 --> 22:01.319
- and all your bills are coming to me.
- What is this about?

22:03.489 --> 22:05.198
Brian and I are getting married.

22:08.411 --> 22:11.329
- How nice for...
- You don't have to say anything.

22:11.414 --> 22:12.789
Just listen.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.208
We're moving to Italy
and the end of the month.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.335
Brian's taking over the Rome offices.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.170
Sounds like Brian's on a roll.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.257
And he wants to adopt Walt.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.220
Look, I know this is hard.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.264
But just think about it.

22:29.807 --> 22:33.184
- You're kidding me, right?
- Consider what's best for Walt.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.520
You can keep holding on if you want.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.273
But ask yourself why you're doing that.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.026
Is it really for him?

22:41.110 --> 22:42.819
Or is it for you?

22:49.326 --> 22:52.495
Dude, your kid's gone.

22:52.788 --> 22:53.747
What?

22:53.831 --> 22:56.291
He just grabbed the dog
and took off.

23:02.465 --> 23:04.591
I know where he's gone.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.476
Locke!

23:15.394 --> 23:17.062
- Where the hell is he?
- What?

23:17.146 --> 23:19.022
I'm not in the mood
for your games, man.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.566
- Where's Walt?
- Walt's not here.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.027
- Don't lie to me.
- He's not here. Look around.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.488
- I'm not talking to you.
- I told him this morning

23:26.572 --> 23:28.531
that he couldn't be around me anymore.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.992
I'm trying to respect your wishes.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.793
Well, then if he's not...

23:48.844 --> 23:50.470
Let's go find your boy.

23:54.517 --> 23:55.850
Thanks.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.853
You really didn't
have to help, you know.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.772
I could've managed.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.233
I've had my share of manly encounters.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.360
I just thought
you could use the company.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.863
You OK?

24:11.283 --> 24:12.742
Yeah.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.372
It's weird.

24:18.999 --> 24:23.294
I barely knew her.
Barely know her... Claire.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.549
She's been missing over a week, and...

24:27.633 --> 24:31.928
...every day she's gone,
it feels like...

24:32.012 --> 24:36.057
...bits of me are crumbling,
or something.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.813
I think it's right that
you should keep her stuff safe...

24:41.897 --> 24:43.731
...'til she gets back.

24:46.819 --> 24:47.902
Yeah.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.632
Come on, Vincent.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.409
Cut it out!

26:20.162 --> 26:21.287
What's wrong?

26:30.339 --> 26:31.673
Vincent!

26:35.803 --> 26:38.054
He was trying to weasel his way out.

26:38.138 --> 26:42.267
Anything not to let the case go forward.
Said it wasn't his jurisdiction.

26:42.351 --> 26:44.310
- You're kidding me.
- I wish I was.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.104
Same argument, third time in a row.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.273
Barclay said it was
an immigration issue.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.649
That's classic.

26:50.359 --> 26:53.611
He thinks 'cause I'm new to
Australian law that I'm some yokel.

26:53.696 --> 26:55.363
Hey. Hello?

26:56.323 --> 26:58.616
- Homework.
- I told you I need help.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.493
- He needs help.
- I'm a lawyer.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.955
- I can tell someone's stalling.
- Who cares about birds of Australia?

27:04.039 --> 27:06.040
We're in Australia.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.961
- You OK?
- I think I'm feeling kinda fluey.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.963
Shouldn't we study "Birds of Egypt"?

27:12.047 --> 27:15.717
You haven't been sleeping much.
Maybe you need to take a personal day.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.635
I picked the bronze-cuckoo.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.971
- It's funny, wanna see?
- What about Barclay?

27:20.055 --> 27:22.307
I mean, it doesn't look funny.
Just the name.

27:22.391 --> 27:25.435
Sleeping in late?
That's too much of a fantasy.

27:25.519 --> 27:26.978
Look!

27:30.065 --> 27:37.030
You're not looking!

27:40.534 --> 27:41.743
Oh, my God!

27:50.127 --> 27:51.711
Is it dead?

27:51.795 --> 27:53.921
Yeah.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.715
Poor guy.

28:15.611 --> 28:16.986
Vincent!

28:46.683 --> 28:47.975
Michael Dawson?

28:49.144 --> 28:50.895
Yeah. Can I help you?

28:53.399 --> 28:54.982
I'm Brian Porter.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.902
Susan's Brian?

28:59.154 --> 29:00.613
Yeah.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.492
Can I come in?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.911
I need to talk to you.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.579
Susan know you're here, man?

29:09.665 --> 29:11.666
Susan died yesterday.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.673
Please.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.930
She...

29:26.807 --> 29:29.225
It turns out she had a blood disorder.

29:30.853 --> 29:32.937
She was only sick for about a week.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.397
I didn't know...

29:34.481 --> 29:37.692
I hadn't talked to her in awhile...
Sit down.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.236
And Walt?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.196
- How is he?
- Yeah, he's fine.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.991
He's back home with his nanny.

29:45.075 --> 29:47.368
- What?
- I mean he's fine...

29:47.453 --> 29:50.121
I mean, considering... You know.

29:50.205 --> 29:53.207
You left him home?
After he just lost his mother?

29:54.460 --> 29:57.587
Before she died, Susan,

29:57.671 --> 30:01.424
she told me she wanted you
to have custody of Walter.

30:01.508 --> 30:02.633
She what?

30:02.718 --> 30:06.471
Well, I think she just thought...
I mean, since you're his father...

30:06.555 --> 30:08.848
I haven't been his father in nine years.

30:09.808 --> 30:13.728
Yeah, well,
that's kinda the thing, see.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.565
Look, I loved Susan very much.

30:18.525 --> 30:21.027
And I was honest with her
from the beginning.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.696
But she wouldn't hear it.

30:24.198 --> 30:26.824
- Hear what?
- That I...

30:26.909 --> 30:29.368
I didn't want to be a father.
I just don't know how.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.996
What are you talking about?
You adopted him.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.706
I did, because she wanted that,

30:33.790 --> 30:35.500
and I wanted her, and...

30:36.084 --> 30:37.710
Look...

30:39.796 --> 30:42.340
Two tickets.
One round-trip, the other one-way.

30:42.424 --> 30:46.260
Sydney to New York. The envelope
has money in it for travel expenses.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.847
She didn't tell you
she wanted me to have custody.

30:49.932 --> 30:52.350
- This is your idea.
- I'm a wreck right now, OK?

30:52.434 --> 30:54.018
I'm supposed to give a damn?

30:54.102 --> 30:56.771
I just lost the woman I love.
I can't be his father.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.689
Lying son-of-a-bitch.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.566
You're the only father he knows!

31:00.651 --> 31:02.944
- What?
- There's something about him.

31:04.905 --> 31:06.906
What the hell
are you talking about, man?

31:10.410 --> 31:13.788
Sometimes when he's around,
things happen.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.918
He's different somehow.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.466
Over here!

31:29.263 --> 31:32.014
- What the hell would...
- Help, please!

31:32.933 --> 31:34.225
This way...

31:36.061 --> 31:37.478
Walt!

31:41.567 --> 31:43.985
Walt should be home from school
any minute.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.155
Mr. Porter asked me to give you that.

31:48.532 --> 31:49.991
Some of Susan's effects.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.326
Oh, thanks.

31:53.203 --> 31:55.663
There's something else.

32:04.006 --> 32:07.842
- What's that?
- Something I think Walt should have.

32:11.221 --> 32:12.597
Excuse me.

32:44.004 --> 32:47.006
- Walt?
- Yeah?

32:47.090 --> 32:49.550
There's somebody here to see you.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.943
Dad! Help!

33:11.239 --> 33:13.741
Dad, help! Please!

33:24.628 --> 33:27.129
Come on! Up here!

33:45.649 --> 33:46.649
Hey, Walt.

33:50.404 --> 33:51.654
Who are you?

33:53.949 --> 33:55.616
I'm...

34:03.500 --> 34:06.127
I'm your father.

34:16.513 --> 34:18.264
I want you to know...

34:19.850 --> 34:22.893
Listen, I can't explain
how sorry I am...

34:22.978 --> 34:25.271
...about your mom.

34:25.813 --> 34:30.025
You should know that...

34:30.110 --> 34:34.237
...we loved each other
very much when we had you.

34:34.322 --> 34:36.239
Where's Brian?

34:37.826 --> 34:40.202
Brian's not here.

34:40.286 --> 34:44.665
I come to bring you home with me.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.668
I'm not going anywhere with you.

34:52.549 --> 34:54.842
Look, Walt, can I...?

34:59.097 --> 35:03.100
I know this is really hard
to understand. All of this.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.604
See, Brian...

35:09.524 --> 35:12.109
Brian loves you very much.

35:12.194 --> 35:15.946
You know, he wants you to stay
with him, but it's not his choice.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.324
It's mine.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.534
I'm your legal guardian.

35:22.245 --> 35:26.457
And it's not like he's gonna
disappear from your life.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.793
He'll still call you, write to you,

35:28.877 --> 35:30.544
come to see you whenever he can.

35:32.380 --> 35:36.217
And you know,
you'll still have your dog.

35:37.844 --> 35:41.263
But, Vincent isn't mine.

35:41.348 --> 35:42.723
He's Brian's.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.894
Brian said you could have him.

35:56.071 --> 35:57.738
- Hey, Walt!
- Dad!

35:58.865 --> 36:01.116
- Where are you, Dad?
- Hang on!

36:10.418 --> 36:13.087
OK. Let's go. Let's go.

36:18.969 --> 36:21.262
Hey, Walt, just hang in there, OK?

36:26.434 --> 36:28.060
I'm coming, man.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.272
- Dad!
- Walt!

36:31.940 --> 36:34.108
Throw him the knife.

36:41.074 --> 36:43.409
If he comes near you, use it!

36:51.334 --> 36:53.085
Stay there, buddy!

36:58.174 --> 36:59.633
Come here.

37:04.306 --> 37:06.223
- You OK?
- Yeah.

37:06.308 --> 37:08.058
- Yeah.
- All right.

37:08.143 --> 37:11.562
Whatever you do, you hold
onto this tight. You got me?

37:11.646 --> 37:13.898
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

37:13.982 --> 37:17.568
I'll be right behind you, OK?
So, hold on.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.653
OK, Locke, now!

37:21.406 --> 37:23.324
Pull him.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.867
Come here.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.374
I'm sorry...

38:13.458 --> 38:16.210
No, it's OK.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.587
We're OK.

38:18.672 --> 38:22.049
- I'm just glad you're safe.
- But, Vincent, he ran off again.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.844
He found his way back to you once.

38:28.264 --> 38:29.807
He will again.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.491
Hey.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.662
I got a present for you.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.043
Since you like to look at pictures.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.838
- What's this?
- Well...

39:07.470 --> 39:12.016
Every card, every letter I sent you
over the last eight years.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.561
You wrote me?

39:20.316 --> 39:22.276
I never saw these.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.282
Did my mom have these?

39:33.455 --> 39:37.124
- Why didn't she give 'em to me?
- I don't know.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.044
She didn't throw 'em away.
Which means somewhere inside,

39:40.128 --> 39:41.879
she wanted you to have them.

39:43.256 --> 39:45.424
So, you drew these?

39:45.508 --> 39:47.301
Just for you.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.637
This one...

39:50.722 --> 39:53.307
...I did for your second birthday.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.939
A penguin with a sunburn?

40:01.691 --> 40:03.567
- That's dumb.
- Yeah, I know.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.944
That's what I said.

40:51.741 --> 40:52.825
Jack!

40:54.702 --> 40:55.869
Sayid.

40:56.037 --> 40:57.496
You have to hear this.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.207
- What is that?
- It's Claire's, her diary.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.460
- You're reading her diary?
- Yeah, I know, I'm bloody scum.

41:03.545 --> 41:06.046
Just listen to this.
"I had that weird dream again.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.382
With the black rock
I can't get away from.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.217
I try to leave, but it won't let me."

41:10.301 --> 41:12.553
- Black rock?
- They're just dreams.

41:12.637 --> 41:15.806
- No.
- Sayid mentioned the black rock before.

41:15.890 --> 41:19.268
The Frenchwoman said her team
was returning from the black rock.

41:21.396 --> 41:23.438
The triangle on the map.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.107
Maybe it's the triangle.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.609
Maybe it's where Claire was taken.

41:27.694 --> 41:31.238
Maybe. We all want to find Claire.

41:31.948 --> 41:35.742
But there's no sense going out into
the jungle in the middle of the night.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.335
Don't think that whistle's working.

41:46.671 --> 41:49.089
You can't hear everything.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.592
The sooner you learn that, the better.

41:59.392 --> 42:01.018
Well, I heard that.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.775
Is that you?

42:33.593 --> 42:35.344
Claire?
