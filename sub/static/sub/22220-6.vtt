WEBVTT

00:02.587 --> 00:04.543
Crichton!

00:04.630 --> 00:06.416
Crichton!

00:07.216 --> 00:09.172
Where is the human?!

00:09.260 --> 00:10.625
( squeaking )

00:12.805 --> 00:15.046
Bring him to me.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.815
Bring him to me.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.102
You're dead.

00:30.198 --> 00:34.282
It's been three days.
He still can't be freaking
like that.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.030
It's Luxan Hyper Rage.
It doesn't just go away.

00:37.121 --> 00:39.112
You were wise to hide
as you did, John.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.994
D'argo's been off the ship
for three whole days

00:42.084 --> 00:44.336
but we couldn't find
you to tell you.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.253
You hide very well. You must
have had a lot of practice.

00:47.340 --> 00:48.750
(laughing)

00:48.841 --> 00:50.001
Shut up.

00:50.092 --> 00:51.127
It comes natural.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.961
Especially when you got that
chasing you.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.341
Why the hell is he raging
after me, anyway?

00:56.432 --> 00:57.467
You are another male.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.389
Well, spanky here is male.

00:59.477 --> 01:00.967
I think. Sort of.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.268
I mean, how come he's
notaﬁeryou?

01:02.355 --> 01:04.266
He knows better.

01:04.357 --> 01:06.222
So, where is he now?

01:06.317 --> 01:08.729
He's taken my Prowler
down to the planet.

01:08.819 --> 01:11.071
Hopefully, the rage has had
time to dissipate.

01:11.155 --> 01:14.363
Or he's killed something.

01:14.450 --> 01:17.863
Aeryn:
Pilot, we'll contact you once
we've located D'argo.

01:38.182 --> 01:40.218
Oh, yeah. I think I've
seen this one.

01:40.309 --> 01:43.847
Mel Gibson, Tina Turner,
cage match.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.269
Oh. What?

01:45.356 --> 01:47.893
Oh, don't worry. Nobody saw
the third one, anyway.

01:47.984 --> 01:49.724
Will you be all right in
this heat, my dear?

01:49.819 --> 01:51.901
Aeryn:
I'll be all right as
long as it's night.

01:51.988 --> 01:53.319
Rygel:
This is night?

01:53.406 --> 01:55.021
Crichton:
Yeah. Back home we call
it white night.

01:55.116 --> 01:58.859
I call it: let's find the
Luxan and save ourselves
heat seizure.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.568
Well, I think we've
found the place.

02:00.663 --> 02:02.528
Zhaan:
Shall we?

02:04.375 --> 02:07.287
(rhythmic, tinny drumming)

02:18.264 --> 02:20.129
Crichton:
Sebaceans, right?

02:20.224 --> 02:22.055
They're Sebaceans?

02:22.143 --> 02:24.350
Always good to see family.

02:24.437 --> 02:26.428
Family? No.

02:26.522 --> 02:27.932
These are common laborers.

02:28.024 --> 02:30.686
They are a distant cousin
species, at best.

02:30.776 --> 02:34.519
Crichton:
Kissing cousins, just like
humans and Sebaceans.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.524
( chuckles )

02:36.615 --> 02:39.982
Yes. Well, the day that they
prove that is the day

02:40.077 --> 02:44.662
I let Palmolian meat hounds
tear all the flesh from
my bones.

03:04.477 --> 03:06.388
Get off of me or I'll hurt you!

03:11.901 --> 03:14.768
(laughing)

03:14.862 --> 03:16.193
This is the end of Hyper Rage?

03:16.280 --> 03:17.611
| get hugged to death?

03:17.698 --> 03:21.111
It's so good to see
you, Crichton.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.443
It's so very good to see you.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.199
(laughing continues)

03:32.213 --> 03:34.329
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

03:34.423 --> 03:37.631
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

03:37.718 --> 03:39.800
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe

03:39.887 --> 03:41.502
on a ship. A living ship

03:41.597 --> 03:43.929
Full of strange alien
life-forms...

03:44.016 --> 03:44.766
Help me...

03:44.850 --> 03:46.351
Listen, please.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.221
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:48.312 --> 03:52.476
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

03:52.566 --> 03:54.852
...doing everything I can...

03:54.944 --> 03:57.435
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.882
D'argo have you been laboring?

04:23.973 --> 04:25.713
l have.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.298
What is wrong with you?

04:27.393 --> 04:30.977
D'Argo:
Nothing. Everything is right.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.308
Everything...

04:33.399 --> 04:35.264
is very right.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.941
Rygel:
What about your Hyper Rage?

04:38.028 --> 04:39.529
( chuckles )

04:40.197 --> 04:41.733
Kill anyone?

04:41.824 --> 04:44.440
No. That is all gone.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.992
Now there is just...

04:47.079 --> 04:47.864
contentment.

04:47.955 --> 04:48.910
(grunts)

04:48.998 --> 04:51.330
You are a warrior.

04:51.417 --> 04:52.953
Act like one.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.624
I'm no warrior.

04:54.712 --> 04:59.206
I've been a prisoner now and
a fugitive longer than
I was ever a warrior.

04:59.300 --> 05:03.885
Don't you think it was time I
stopped lying to myself about
who I really am?

05:03.971 --> 05:08.180
Here, my efforts have purpose.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.848
Purpose?

05:09.935 --> 05:11.311
What purpose?

05:20.863 --> 05:23.275
My boy D'argo, into the
promised land.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.983
Aeryn:
Yes, and he's left
his brain behind.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.335
(munching)

05:38.422 --> 05:41.289
Zhaan:
We may soon have some answers.

05:44.136 --> 05:47.378
I am Volmae.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.423
Greetings.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.638
I am Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.142
This is John Crichton.

05:58.234 --> 05:59.895
Aeryn Sun.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.692
And his Eminence Dominar
Rygel the 16th.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.395
( belches )

06:04.490 --> 06:09.200
(speaking slowly):
It is a pleasure to welcome
you to Sykar.

06:09.286 --> 06:19.207
lam our leader as much as
anyone is our leader.

06:19.296 --> 06:25.792
Your friend D'argo has been
telling us about you.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.969
Telling you that we are
just passing through.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.796
We do not want to harm you.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.553
Of course you don't.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.477
Please stay.

06:36.564 --> 06:40.933
Stay as long as you desire.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.321
She gives me a woody.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.318
"Woody", it's a human saying.

06:52.413 --> 06:56.452
I've heard you say it often
when you don't trust someone or
they make you nervous.

06:56.542 --> 06:57.748
They give you...

06:57.835 --> 06:59.075
Willies.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.160
She gives you the willies.

07:01.255 --> 07:05.248
(voice from speaker):
Thank you for your cycle of
work, kind citizens.

07:05.342 --> 07:10.177
As the celebration ends enjoy
the rest you have so
richly earned.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.175
Definitely a simple people.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.131
They never heard of
the last call.

07:14.226 --> 07:17.468
(voice from speaker):
Be strong and healthful.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.973
Keep the production
lines going.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.725
( Rygel belches )

07:20.816 --> 07:22.852
Rygel.

07:22.943 --> 07:26.231
I'm very, very full.

07:26.322 --> 07:28.108
I need to... ( belches)

07:28.198 --> 07:29.529
Excuse me.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.198
D'argo!

07:33.871 --> 07:36.283
D'Argo:
You're staying the night,
excellent.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.829
Tomorrow's a rest day.

07:37.916 --> 07:42.000
I'll be able to show you all
the wonders of this planet.

07:45.424 --> 07:46.334
(grunts)

07:46.425 --> 07:48.290
Listen to me.

07:48.385 --> 07:53.254
No matter what happens,
no matter what you hear,
you must stay.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.387
There you are.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.519
I just had the weirdest
thing happen...

08:04.610 --> 08:06.726
Aeryn:
ljust spoke to D'argo.
He says he's content.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.402
He wants to stay. So, I say
we leave him and we go.

08:09.490 --> 08:14.450
What? No. Look, Woodstock has
done something to his head.

08:14.536 --> 08:15.912
( explosion )

08:15.996 --> 08:18.658
(yelling)

08:18.749 --> 08:20.239
( passing gas)
The assassins!

08:20.334 --> 08:22.199
The bastards are trying
to kill me!

08:22.294 --> 08:25.878
Rygel! What the hell
happened here?

08:25.964 --> 08:29.377
A bomb, mere hentas from
where l was...

08:29.468 --> 08:31.459
l was, uh... hovering.

08:31.553 --> 08:32.679
A bomb?

08:32.763 --> 08:34.549
No. No. No. What were you
doing out here?

08:34.640 --> 08:36.426
l was relieving myself.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.007
Rygel, did you see anyone?

08:38.102 --> 08:39.717
No. No one.

08:39.812 --> 08:41.723
One moment I was... was...

08:41.814 --> 08:43.850
Yeah, relieving yourself.
And the next?

08:43.941 --> 08:45.147
And the next...

08:45.234 --> 08:46.269
Boom!

08:46.360 --> 08:49.102
I've suffered many assassination
attempts on Hyneria...

08:49.196 --> 08:50.231
Nobody knows you here.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.233
It's only people who know you
who want to kill you.

08:52.324 --> 08:53.700
The sun will be up
in a few hours.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.740
The heat is going to
get very intense.

08:55.828 --> 08:58.865
Aeryn, it's going to
get hot soon.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.572
All right.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.157
I'll take him back up to Moya.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.583
Come on, your Eminence.

09:04.670 --> 09:07.082
Hmm, I'm still scorched.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.001
And, Crichton!

09:10.092 --> 09:11.923
Remember, we agreed,
no lingering.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.717
I'm coming back and we're
getting out of here with
or without D'argo.

09:14.805 --> 09:18.844
Fine. Just get Spanky
back to the ship.

09:21.145 --> 09:22.851
( knocking )

09:28.402 --> 09:29.812
How did you find me?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.814
We asked around.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.987
You stand out amongst
your neighbors.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.947
Oh, uh, come in.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.990
Please, come in.

09:41.707 --> 09:44.870
Crichton:
So, you have your own
apartment. It's nice.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.996
It is provided.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.124
D'argo, something isn't quite
right about this place

09:50.215 --> 09:52.957
and it is affecting you.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.542
You don't see how
you're acting?

09:55.637 --> 09:58.800
D'argo, why don't you come
back with us to Moya?

09:58.891 --> 10:04.261
You are both welcome to stay
as long as you want.

10:09.735 --> 10:14.229
But I'm afraid all that I can
offer you is, uh, the floor.

10:15.199 --> 10:17.315
-D'argo!
-Tomorrow.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.121
I suppose we will have to wait.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.248
( D'argo growling )

10:30.339 --> 10:32.125
Ooh, yeah.

10:33.926 --> 10:36.167
Not exactly five star, is it?

10:36.261 --> 10:38.297
D'Argo seems happy with it.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.253
Everybody seems happy.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.305
And very friendly.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.976
I wish I could believe that the
woman in there is the only
reason he wants to stay.

10:46.063 --> 10:50.306
Zhaan, this city, it looks like
it used to be a working city.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.856
Now, apparently, nothing works.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.354
Yeah, but it used to.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.232
This city is falling apart
around them and they...

10:56.323 --> 10:57.938
they just don't seem to care.

10:58.033 --> 11:01.150
Material comfort's not the only
measure of a society, John.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.327
But progress has gone backwards
on this planet,

11:03.413 --> 11:05.699
and nobody on this planet
gives a damn.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.076
Tell me why?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.783
You won't get any answers
tonight, John.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.290
Let's rest. We can ask
D'Argo in the morning.

11:12.381 --> 11:13.336
Yeah.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.206
Whoa!

11:16.301 --> 11:19.793
Um, you, ah, you take
the mattress.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.344
I'm good on the floor.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.387
Don't be silly, John.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.426
You'll be cold and
uncomfortable.

11:29.398 --> 11:32.356
There's plenty of room for two.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.943
( explosion )

11:34.027 --> 11:36.063
Rygel:
Oh! Help me!

11:36.154 --> 11:38.145
(explosions continue)

11:38.240 --> 11:39.195
Help me!

11:39.283 --> 11:40.113
(whispering ):
Pilot?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.189
Already on it.

11:41.285 --> 11:44.197
The explosion was not
ship-related.

11:44.288 --> 11:47.621
It definitely originated
inside Rygel's quarters.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.699
Oh, help me.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.249
( explosion )

11:51.336 --> 11:52.451
(moaning)

11:52.546 --> 11:54.082
Oh, Aeryn!

11:54.172 --> 11:55.878
(whimpering)

11:55.966 --> 11:57.627
( explosion )

12:00.888 --> 12:03.345
What's doing this to me?

12:03.432 --> 12:04.797
Don't move.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.559
(whimpering)

12:12.482 --> 12:14.018
Don't...

12:14.109 --> 12:15.269
move.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.692
(moaning)

12:24.202 --> 12:26.488
( squeaking )

12:52.314 --> 12:54.145
Aeryn (on comms ):
Crichton.

12:57.653 --> 12:58.517
Yeah?

12:58.612 --> 13:00.477
We have a situation up here.

13:00.572 --> 13:04.190
I'm sure it's not any more
interesting than the
situation down here.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.525
Well, remember Rygel's
assassination attempt?

13:06.620 --> 13:07.780
He caused it himself.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.157
His body fluids have
turned explosive.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.910
I stand corrected.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.286
What am I going to do now?

13:14.378 --> 13:15.493
Do you want to live?

13:15.587 --> 13:17.123
Then you better stop sweating.
So, calm down, now.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.421
Aeryn, listen, you got
to run some tests.

13:19.508 --> 13:23.547
Use the scanner thing in the,
uh... in the maintenance bay.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.218
No. I'm not the scientist.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.217
I know that. Just have
Pilot help you.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.765
What am I supposed to do
in the meantime?

13:30.852 --> 13:31.932
Isolate him.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.931
Uh, no fluids. No food.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.478
(gasping )1
What?

13:35.565 --> 13:40.184
Yeah, and when you get some
results call me and I'll...

13:40.278 --> 13:43.862
( sighs )
see what I can figure out.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.949
(voice from speaker):
Good morning, citizens.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.322
A new day begins.

13:52.541 --> 13:56.284
( distantly)
Remember, rejoice in
your work...

14:02.092 --> 14:03.923
Good morning, John.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.635
D'argo...

14:11.727 --> 14:13.934
No time now, John.
I'll speak to you tonight.

14:14.021 --> 14:14.976
No time?

14:15.063 --> 14:16.599
Yeah. I'll be late for work.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.806
I thought today was a, uh...

14:18.900 --> 14:20.026
a rest day.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.099
No. No. No.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.186
Today is the last day
of the work cycle.

14:24.281 --> 14:29.275
Tonight, there is going to be
a great big celebration.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.746
I'll, uh, see you there, John.

14:43.050 --> 14:46.463
(growling)

14:48.221 --> 14:49.927
(voice from speaker):
Good morning, citizens.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.631
A new day begins.

14:52.726 --> 14:57.766
Remember, rejoice in your work
and you will be rewarded.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.392
Be temperate.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.144
Be strong and healthful.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.067
Keep production lines flowing.

15:04.154 --> 15:07.942
Efficiency in your endeavours
will be observed and noted.

15:08.033 --> 15:12.117
Your reward status can
therefore be improved.

15:12.204 --> 15:14.195
Keep your mind on your task.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.871
Free yourself of all concerns.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.459
Focus only on the task.

15:18.543 --> 15:22.161
The future of Sykar's
prosperity depends
on what happens.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.120
Eat the Tannot root.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.706
Be strong and healthy.

15:25.801 --> 15:28.292
Keep your production
lines flowing.

15:29.471 --> 15:32.383
(speaker voice continues
distantly)

16:20.397 --> 16:23.059
Hey. I want to talk to you.

16:28.572 --> 16:31.063
You seem interested in me.
What do you say we talk?

16:31.158 --> 16:32.614
All right.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.193
Just come on, quickly!

16:36.288 --> 16:37.619
What the...?!

16:37.706 --> 16:40.197
( buzzing )
Ivan, do it now.
There is no time.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.032
(yelling)

16:45.172 --> 16:47.959
Listen, you must tell
no one of this.

16:48.049 --> 16:51.337
If they know you carry the worm
they will kill you for it.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.669
Eat and the pain will go away.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.175
Understand me? You must eat.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.052
Ivan, the carriage is moving.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.893
(moans)

17:17.245 --> 17:20.612
( distant and distorted voices
from speakers )

17:24.211 --> 17:26.167
...be strong...

17:37.140 --> 17:39.597
...free yourself of
all concern...

17:41.686 --> 17:43.472
(distorted voices get louder)

17:43.563 --> 17:45.224
( groans )

17:45.315 --> 17:46.725
...eat the tannot root.

17:46.816 --> 17:47.942
Be strong.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.563
Our way of life...

17:50.654 --> 17:53.270
...in addition...

17:53.365 --> 17:55.697
rejoice in your work and
you will be rewarded.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.116
The guards are your
protectors...

18:03.333 --> 18:06.541
...free yourself of all
concern. Remember...

18:13.260 --> 18:16.377
Rejoice in your work and
you will be rewarded...

18:17.639 --> 18:19.220
...the guards are
your protectors.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.843
Trust them... trust them...

18:24.062 --> 18:26.178
Zhaan:
You're still so young, D'argo.

18:26.273 --> 18:29.390
Is this the way you honestly
want to spend the rest
of your days?

18:29.484 --> 18:33.068
Do you want to spend the rest
of your days on the run?

18:35.824 --> 18:40.067
I know such decisions can
come upon one quickly.

18:40.161 --> 18:45.281
My choice to join the Delvian
Seek, to become a priest,

18:45.375 --> 18:50.244
occurred in the matter of
a blink of an eye.

18:50.338 --> 18:56.800
One moment, I was lying in
my cell, a savage capable
of anything.

18:56.886 --> 19:03.348
The next, the truth was
revealed to me and I
knew my true path.

19:03.435 --> 19:06.802
Such revelations are possible.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.313
This feels very...

19:11.401 --> 19:13.266
Satisfying.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.111
Yes, it does.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.362
Here, let me help.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.202
Aeryn:
Are you sure he's still alive?

19:32.297 --> 19:37.041
He's in cryo-stasis.
He should be fine.

19:37.135 --> 19:38.966
Just as long as he
isn't sweating.

19:39.054 --> 19:40.590
Definitely not.

19:40.680 --> 19:46.300
We've taken him to 105 below
the glarion frost point.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.009
( Pilot clearing throat)

19:48.104 --> 19:52.814
I strongly suggest you don't
touch any of his other
protuberances.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.108
Oh, well, you can do it
yourself, then.

19:55.195 --> 19:58.232
The scanner is ancillary
to Moya's systems.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.109
I'm afraid I can't access it.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.067
Well, I'll just push the vid
screen so that you can see it.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.743
Please, Officer Sun...

20:05.830 --> 20:08.537
I will instruct you through
the process.

20:12.295 --> 20:15.787
( muffled voices continue )

20:17.050 --> 20:21.339
(Crichton groaning )

20:31.314 --> 20:32.520
D'argo:
John!

20:32.607 --> 20:35.144
I've been wondering what
happened to you all day.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.396
I'll get some clothing for you.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.319
It's good to see you.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.614
You spent the entire day here?

20:42.700 --> 20:46.067
Yeah. Eating and throwing up.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.777
That's what I've got to
talk to you about...

20:47.872 --> 20:50.488
I'm so sorry you weren't out
there with us today, John.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.289
D'argo was right.

20:52.377 --> 20:55.961
It's an absolutely
wonderful place.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.787
What?

20:57.882 --> 21:01.170
Oh, God, no. Not you, too!

21:01.261 --> 21:02.842
Of course me, too.

21:02.929 --> 21:06.797
How could I deny myself such
supreme contentment?

21:06.891 --> 21:10.258
No. No. No damn way. You're not
going to do this to me.

21:10.353 --> 21:11.513
You got to snap out of it!

21:11.604 --> 21:13.265
Snap out of what?

21:13.356 --> 21:14.892
You talk as though I don't
know what I'm doing.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.974
Zhaan, look. We got to get
back to the ship.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.229
It doesn't matter if
D'Argo doesn't come.
We'll come back for him.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.446
You and me...

21:20.530 --> 21:22.236
Why should I want to leave?

21:22.991 --> 21:24.071
Listen to you.

21:24.159 --> 21:27.026
Look at you!

21:27.120 --> 21:30.112
The dirt and grime of an
honest day's labor, John.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.742
It feels so good.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.118
Here you are, Zhaan.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.586
Thank you. This is going to be
so much more comfortable.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.581
Uh, one moment.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.584
Zhaan...

21:40.675 --> 21:42.290
please...

21:42.385 --> 21:43.966
you got to help me here. Okay?

21:44.053 --> 21:45.088
I need your help.

21:45.180 --> 21:46.420
They did something to me.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.300
What did they do to you, John?

21:48.391 --> 21:50.973
Zhaan:
What is it? You can tell us.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.642
It's nothing...

21:57.775 --> 21:59.515
it's nothing.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.021
Great!

22:01.112 --> 22:03.819
Put these on. You'll feel more
comfortable around the others.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.022
What others?

22:05.116 --> 22:06.492
We're going to celebrate.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.908
It's a rest day tomorrow.

22:13.208 --> 22:17.542
(drums beating)

22:17.629 --> 22:20.371
Well, hello. How nice
to see you again.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.292
Come.

22:22.383 --> 22:24.374
Join us for a drink.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.473
Father, sit up straighter.

22:29.557 --> 22:30.467
You must sit up.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.935
This is my daughter, Tanga.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.351
-My name is Hybin.
-You!

22:35.438 --> 22:37.554
You stuck some kind of
worm thing in me.

22:37.649 --> 22:41.358
The worm is the only thing
that is protecting you.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.480
Without it, you would already
be like them.

22:43.571 --> 22:44.856
Yeah, how can a worm...

22:44.948 --> 22:49.282
It thrives on the toxin that
is within the tannot.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.077
Wait a minute.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.870
Wa-wa-wait.

22:54.958 --> 22:58.416
Are you telling me everybody
acts like this because
of the food?

22:58.503 --> 23:00.960
You must act like one of us.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.583
Like one of them.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.335
They will expect it.

23:04.425 --> 23:08.009
If they discover you are immune
they will execute you.

23:08.096 --> 23:11.213
Right...

23:11.307 --> 23:13.468
So, have you guys got the worm
thing inside of you, too?

23:13.560 --> 23:16.267
Our immunity is natural.

23:16.354 --> 23:19.972
We don't know why we are immune
and the others are not

23:20.066 --> 23:22.148
but it is very rare.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.351
Our numbers are few.

23:25.697 --> 23:26.527
Why me?

23:26.614 --> 23:29.230
Because we need you.

23:31.244 --> 23:32.575
Wait. Come...

23:32.662 --> 23:36.029
If they know you are immune
they will kill you.

23:45.842 --> 23:48.174
Aah...

23:48.261 --> 23:51.219
Handsome.

23:51.306 --> 23:54.173
Very handsome indeed.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.223
Thank you.

23:56.311 --> 23:57.721
These clothes are wonderful.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.018
They're just...

23:59.105 --> 24:00.686
wonderful.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.183
And the food?

24:02.275 --> 24:04.732
It is to your liking?

24:04.819 --> 24:08.186
Aah, it's just great.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.772
Everything's just...

24:10.867 --> 24:13.108
it's great.

24:15.246 --> 24:21.207
And the other two who were here
with you last night?

24:21.294 --> 24:23.285
They went back to the ship.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.289
But they will come back?

24:27.383 --> 24:28.418
Oh, yeah.

24:28.509 --> 24:31.251
Yeah. I want them to...

24:31.346 --> 24:35.635
feel what contentment
I feel here.

24:35.725 --> 24:39.058
About your ship.

24:39.145 --> 24:43.058
D'argo tells us it is a...

24:43.149 --> 24:45.811
cargo vessel.

24:45.902 --> 24:49.815
Yes. Yes. She is.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.565
Eat...

24:53.660 --> 24:56.902
and enjoy...

24:58.289 --> 25:01.622
after all, tomorrow

25:01.709 --> 25:03.745
; g. g, .,

fféggiz;

25:03.836 --> 25:06.418
a rest day.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.259
I don't want to do this.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.433
Officer Sun, please.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.181
You were making progress.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.772
It's just really tedious.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.357
Sometimes, science is.

25:25.441 --> 25:29.184
But Dominar Rygel's life
depends on our finding
the cause

25:29.278 --> 25:32.770
of this phenomenon and
rectifying it if we can.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.322
Look, all this analysis dren
comes really naturally to you.

25:35.410 --> 25:36.490
It just doesn't to me.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.078
On the contrary.

25:38.162 --> 25:41.154
I, too, have difficulty
with complex sciences.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.080
Yeah. Right.

25:43.167 --> 25:47.251
When a Pilot is bonded to
a Leviathan, as I am
bonded to Moya,

25:47.338 --> 25:52.583
it is as a navigator, 3
monitor of all the living
ship's functions.

25:52.677 --> 25:57.216
The analysis of scientific data
is not something I know or
easily understand.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.341
Yeah, but you're good at it.

25:58.433 --> 26:00.515
I study every chance I can.

26:00.601 --> 26:04.640
Moya was born with a
very complete bank of
scientific data.

26:04.731 --> 26:07.097
(sighs)

26:07.191 --> 26:12.185
I only comprehend a fraction,
I'm afraid.

26:14.157 --> 26:15.272
Do the others know about this?

26:15.366 --> 26:17.448
I have told no one.

26:17.535 --> 26:20.151
I'd prefer they didn't know.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.861
But you've told me.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.536
I feel I can trust you.

26:26.419 --> 26:27.454
Look, can we just, uh...

26:27.545 --> 26:29.911
can we just get on with this
if we're going to do it?

26:30.006 --> 26:33.294
( muffled voice speaking
through P.A. )

27:21.432 --> 27:23.673
Well, I think that's it.

27:23.768 --> 27:26.054
Good. If you say it is.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.887
No. well, I can prep another
slide of Rygel's blood

27:28.981 --> 27:31.063
and check his liver and
altex functions again.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.141
No need.

27:33.236 --> 27:35.318
So, what are you saying,
that it's done?

27:35.404 --> 27:36.530
That I did it?

27:36.614 --> 27:37.524
You did.

27:37.615 --> 27:38.650
No. You helped me a lot.

27:38.741 --> 27:42.108
No, Aeryn Sun, it was you.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.321
It was me.

27:49.502 --> 27:53.711
voice( over speaker):
Remember, rejoice in your work
and you will be rewarded.

27:53.798 --> 27:55.504
(grunting)

28:18.406 --> 28:19.896
Aeryn:
Crichton.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.322
It's me.

28:24.996 --> 28:26.202
(whispering ):
Yeah.

28:26.289 --> 28:29.156
Listen, I've worked out what's
wrong with Rygel.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.160
What is it?

28:30.251 --> 28:31.707
A reaction to food.

28:31.794 --> 28:32.954
What?

28:33.045 --> 28:35.127
Oh, right, he ate some
of the tannot root.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.045
So, what, it turned
his fluids...

28:37.133 --> 28:41.718
Explosive. His Hynerian body
chemistry acted like
a catalyst.

28:41.804 --> 28:43.135
Well can you flush it
out of him?

28:43.222 --> 28:45.008
Already doing that.

28:45.099 --> 28:47.306
I've set up a leaching sieve.
We're collecting all the
volatile elements

28:47.393 --> 28:49.258
and we're just going to flush
them straight out the airlock.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.935
That's good, Aeryn.
That's good.

28:52.023 --> 28:54.981
Listen, what's happening
with D'argo?
Is he coming back or not?

28:55.067 --> 28:57.353
Right now, not.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.436
All right, we'll leave without
him. I'lljust come...

28:59.530 --> 29:01.691
No. No, no, no.

29:01.782 --> 29:04.034
Don't do that.

29:04.118 --> 29:05.233
It's gotten complicated.

29:05.328 --> 29:07.193
"Complicated"?
What do you mean, "complicated"?

29:07.288 --> 29:09.119
Look, just don't come back
down, all right?

29:09.206 --> 29:12.790
If I haven't come up with
any solutions...

29:12.877 --> 29:15.334
If I haven't come up with a
solution by then,

29:15.421 --> 29:17.127
then you and I may have to
leave on our own.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.499
What about Zhaan?

29:18.591 --> 29:19.876
Listen, what is going on
down there?

29:19.967 --> 29:22.344
Just fix Rygel.
I'll be in touch.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.760
( frustrated sigh )

29:25.306 --> 29:27.297
"Complicated."

29:39.195 --> 29:40.560
(grunting)

29:40.655 --> 29:43.863
Here you go.
Let me give you a hand up.

29:44.742 --> 29:45.902
Hi, remember me?

29:45.993 --> 29:48.530
( muffled screams )

29:48.621 --> 29:50.031
You going to scream?

29:50.122 --> 29:51.328
Call attention to us?

29:51.415 --> 29:52.666
Yeah?

29:52.750 --> 29:55.036
Well, go ahead.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.742
I've got to get back out there.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.293
Not before you tell
me something.

29:58.381 --> 30:00.121
I want to know something
right now.

30:00.216 --> 30:02.298
How do I get this
worm out of me?

30:03.594 --> 30:05.004
What? You're not going
to tell me?

30:05.096 --> 30:07.428
Or there is no way.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.224
Damn!

30:13.312 --> 30:15.394
What is the point of all this?

30:16.273 --> 30:17.183
Why do your people...

30:17.274 --> 30:19.481
why did they grow this
stuff to begin with?

30:19.568 --> 30:21.149
It was brought here.

30:21.237 --> 30:22.397
Planted here by the others.

30:22.488 --> 30:23.318
Others?

30:23.406 --> 30:25.192
They forced us to plant it.

30:25.282 --> 30:28.149
Then, once they started eating
it, it changed them.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.109
Most of them.

30:30.204 --> 30:33.537
It made them do anything and
believe anything that was
told to them.

30:33.624 --> 30:36.582
Wait, let me get this straight.

30:36.669 --> 30:39.957
The entire population of
this planet,

30:40.047 --> 30:41.423
they grow this for another race?

30:41.507 --> 30:44.294
Every half-cycle, they return
in their ships,

30:44.385 --> 30:46.216
collect all that we
have harvested.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.134
And the leader, Volmae?

30:48.222 --> 30:50.383
The Others simply chose her from
the crowd. It could have
been any one of us.

30:50.474 --> 30:52.214
Yeah, but she's immune,
like you.

30:52.309 --> 30:53.765
She has the worm.

30:53.853 --> 30:56.390
The worm is very rare.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.472
We only spared you one
because we need you.

30:59.567 --> 31:03.651
( laughing ):
What... what is it that I could
possibly do for you?

31:03.738 --> 31:04.944
You have a ship.

31:05.031 --> 31:08.114
You can find someone out
there who can help us.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.033
Bring us weapons.
Fight beside us.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.953
The tannot is killing
my planet.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.406
Destroying my people.

31:16.500 --> 31:20.084
We can't survive like
this any longer.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.411
It's okay.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.004
It's okay.

31:24.091 --> 31:24.750
Worker:
Tanga...

31:24.842 --> 31:26.628
Tanga, where are you?

31:29.221 --> 31:30.301
Tanga, it's your father.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.344
He's ill.

31:31.432 --> 31:33.263
Come with me.

31:39.356 --> 31:42.143
Here, let me help you
with that one.

31:42.234 --> 31:45.818
I can't anymore, Tanga.

31:45.905 --> 31:48.988
Please, just let them
discover me.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.817
I would rather be dead.

31:51.911 --> 31:55.449
Father, please.

31:55.539 --> 31:58.872
Voice( over speaker):
Share in the celebration, which
you so richly deserve.

31:58.959 --> 32:01.336
The workday is complete.

32:02.630 --> 32:06.339
Oh, this must be the happiest
day of my life.

32:06.425 --> 32:11.670
You'll find the rest day
tomorrow will pass slowly
without the joy of our work.

32:13.015 --> 32:14.221
How's your father?

32:14.308 --> 32:16.014
Surviving.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.969
But every day I'm scared
he'll die out here.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.388
Well Volmae is your leader.

32:22.483 --> 32:25.145
How could she let this happen?

32:25.236 --> 32:27.352
It's her orders.

32:27.446 --> 32:31.735
Every cycle more ground
turns into wasteland
where nothing grows.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.987
That's what you meant when you
said this planet's being
destroyed, yeah?

32:39.208 --> 32:42.200
Sykar was once a garden.

32:42.294 --> 32:46.162
The fields were lush with
coldivara blenirian grain.

32:46.257 --> 32:50.216
But now we plant nothing
but tannot.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.167
And Volmae doesn't care?

32:52.263 --> 32:54.174
No, she doesn't care.

32:54.265 --> 32:56.130
No one cares as long as
they have the tannot.

32:56.225 --> 33:01.140
Yeah, but there must be
people who remember what
it was like before?

33:01.230 --> 33:03.687
Did you see my father's hands?

33:04.275 --> 33:05.355
No.

33:05.442 --> 33:08.980
Once he was the finest
maldique player on Sykar.

33:09.071 --> 33:11.403
People would line the streets
outside the Great Hall

33:11.490 --> 33:14.323
when they heard Hybin
was performing.

33:14.410 --> 33:19.325
Now, you'll have to help us.

33:19.415 --> 33:22.248
(rhythmic music plays)

33:33.012 --> 33:35.845
Was it a fine day of
work for you?

33:35.931 --> 33:39.298
( laughs )
It was a fine day.

33:39.393 --> 33:43.011
Would you mind coming with
me for a short walk?

33:43.105 --> 33:45.312
Sure, whatever you say.

34:07.254 --> 34:10.417
What's it like out there?

34:13.177 --> 34:19.264
I hear space is very cold.

34:22.436 --> 34:26.554
Black and cold.

34:40.287 --> 34:46.704
My people never aspired
to travel the heavens.

34:48.963 --> 34:52.330
This planet is our home.

34:54.134 --> 34:57.342
Was our home.

34:59.848 --> 35:05.969
I suppose a starship
can be a home.

35:08.315 --> 35:13.059
It has been for you, hasn't it?

35:14.280 --> 35:17.943
It's nothing compared to
your paradise here.

35:36.760 --> 35:41.470
Would the cargo hold
of your ship...

35:41.557 --> 35:47.723
accommodate a significant
portion of what you see here?

35:47.813 --> 35:49.849
Not all.

35:49.940 --> 35:52.977
I don't need it all.

35:58.157 --> 36:00.523
So...

36:01.785 --> 36:06.370
what do they do with
all of this?

36:09.335 --> 36:14.955
If it has value to them...

36:15.049 --> 36:21.045
it must have value elsewhere.

36:24.433 --> 36:29.302
You will bring the other
two from your ship

36:29.396 --> 36:34.311
back down here immediately.

36:35.402 --> 36:37.267
Of course.

36:40.324 --> 36:43.782
Then we can start loading.

36:55.297 --> 36:57.379
Peacekeepeh

37:04.014 --> 37:05.800
Come.

37:06.725 --> 37:10.092
It's time we get back.

37:25.369 --> 37:28.202
(shivering):
Oh... oh, leave me alone.

37:30.082 --> 37:31.367
(coughing)

37:31.458 --> 37:34.040
I don't feel well at all.

37:34.128 --> 37:36.710
Quit complaining.
You're lucky to be alive.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.378
Well, I'm barely that.

37:38.465 --> 37:41.923
I did the best that I could and
it wasn't in my training,
you know.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.968
Peacekeepers are trained
only to kill.

37:45.055 --> 37:49.469
Mmm... So don't forget that
this Peacekeeperjust
saved your life.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.391
Oh.

37:51.478 --> 37:54.390
What the yotz does Crichton
want anyway?

37:54.481 --> 37:56.142
And with both of us?

37:56.233 --> 37:58.224
Well, can you understand
Crichton?

37:58.318 --> 38:00.274
(grumbles)

38:08.495 --> 38:09.871
Crichton?

38:09.955 --> 38:11.616
Damn.

38:11.707 --> 38:14.995
Why can't you come in the front
like regular people?

38:15.085 --> 38:16.120
You look terrible, actually.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.167
What's happened to you?

38:18.255 --> 38:22.544
However I look, I feel a
hell of a lot worse.

38:26.263 --> 38:27.548
Where's Rygel?

38:27.639 --> 38:30.346
He's hiding in the pod.
He doesn't like it down here.

38:30.434 --> 38:33.642
Smile, that's what they
do around here.

38:36.899 --> 38:40.187
Great. Well, we gotta grab him.
Find a secluded spot.

38:40.277 --> 38:41.266
What for?

38:41.361 --> 38:42.771
I don't have time for this
right now, okay?

38:42.863 --> 38:45.070
Look, not until you tell me
what's going on.

38:45.157 --> 38:46.613
-Enough, all right?
-Where's Zhaan?

38:46.700 --> 38:49.191
Look, she's with D'argo, okay?

38:49.286 --> 38:51.618
Dancing with the Grateful Dead.

38:51.705 --> 38:54.287
Fine. Can we just grab them
and get out of here?

38:54.374 --> 38:56.285
No, we can't do that, okay?

38:56.376 --> 38:59.834
Not unless Volmae
orders it, and...

39:01.381 --> 39:03.963
Volmae's got plans of her
own, all right?

39:05.219 --> 39:07.210
( street crowd talking )

39:10.057 --> 39:13.265
She's planning on stealing
the last load of tannot

39:13.352 --> 39:16.435
and then blasting out of
here using our ship.

39:16.522 --> 39:17.932
I don't think so.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.605
Exactly. So, come on.

39:22.402 --> 39:23.983
Actually, I don't want
to go anywhere

39:24.071 --> 39:26.232
until you tell me what,
exactly, is going on.

39:26.323 --> 39:27.938
Aeryn, it's complicated.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.773
Complicated? Too complicated
for a Peacekeeper to
understand?

39:29.868 --> 39:31.324
No, I did not say that.

39:31.411 --> 39:32.161
So, tell me.

39:32.246 --> 39:35.204
Aeryn, not today, okay?

39:35.290 --> 39:39.659
I have been out in the sun
all daylong picking up
magic turnips.

39:39.753 --> 39:42.870
I got... I got a worm in my gut

39:42.965 --> 39:46.128
crawling around down in places
where the sun don't shine and
I'm sick of it, okay?

39:46.218 --> 39:48.960
So, for the moment would you
just shut up and help?

39:49.054 --> 39:51.670
Help? What do you think
I've been doing up there
in the ship.

39:51.765 --> 39:53.266
Playing games with Rygel?

39:53.350 --> 39:55.636
Look, I know it's so difficult
up there in the ship.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.059
Difficult? I had to stop him
from blowing himself up to bits.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.637
I had to figure out what was
causing the problem and
I had to fix it.

40:00.732 --> 40:04.441
Yes, I know. And we're all
grateful that you did the
Madame Curie thing, but...

40:04.528 --> 40:05.734
What? Who?

40:05.821 --> 40:08.107
Madame Curie. She's a scientist.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.314
-Scientist?
-Yes.

40:11.952 --> 40:14.068
What I had to do up there was
like a field strategy exercise

40:14.162 --> 40:15.743
only the enemy wasn't
trying to kill me.

40:15.831 --> 40:18.698
The enemy was a puzzle and
there were lots of
different pieces

40:18.792 --> 40:22.410
and independently, separately,
they didn't make any sense

40:22.504 --> 40:25.041
and I had to think it through
really hard and I had
to work out,

40:25.132 --> 40:27.464
try different combinations of
putting them together
and then finally,

40:27.551 --> 40:30.964
I worked out what had happened
and I worked out what
I had to do.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.885
( chuckles )

40:33.390 --> 40:34.345
What?

40:34.433 --> 40:35.639
This is great.

40:35.726 --> 40:37.887
You trading in your pulse rifle
for the junior chemistry kit.

40:37.978 --> 40:40.936
My pulse rifle wasn't any
use to me this time.

40:41.023 --> 40:44.891
I know, but you may need it
again soon, so come on.

40:49.323 --> 40:52.315
( hypnotic dance music playing )

41:00.876 --> 41:04.289
The other two from your ship.

41:04.379 --> 41:07.246
Are they coming?

41:07.341 --> 41:08.706
They're already down.

41:11.345 --> 41:13.336
Bring them to me.

41:13.430 --> 41:16.137
No, I don't think so.

41:16.224 --> 41:20.513
I think I'd rather have you
step outside, princess.

41:20.604 --> 41:26.395
I order you to bring them here.

41:26.485 --> 41:27.895
Now, Aeryn.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.817
( music stops )

41:41.708 --> 41:44.666
Keep the music playing!

41:50.926 --> 41:52.541
( groans )

41:56.098 --> 41:57.383
We want our friends back.

41:57.474 --> 42:00.216
How dare you make demands.

42:00.310 --> 42:03.347
Crichton:
Oh, give it rest, Snow White.

42:03.438 --> 42:05.724
The tannot doesn't affect me;
never did.

42:05.816 --> 42:07.647
John, what are you doing?

42:07.734 --> 42:09.235
Release them.

42:09.319 --> 42:11.935
Crichton:
Look, they're far more trouble
than they're worth.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.146
Why don't you just
give them to us?

42:16.159 --> 42:18.195
This is my home now, John.

42:18.286 --> 42:19.537
I'm happy here.

42:19.621 --> 42:22.203
I will not let you destroy that.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.744
If necessary,

42:24.835 --> 42:27.076
I will destroy you first.

42:27.170 --> 42:28.330
Rygel, now.

42:28.422 --> 42:30.208
(grunts)

42:31.508 --> 42:32.748
Aeryn:
Crichton?

42:32.843 --> 42:33.457
Now, Rygel.

42:33.552 --> 42:34.758
(wailing)

42:34.845 --> 42:36.551
-Crichton.
-Rygel, now.

42:36.638 --> 42:37.343
Now, Rygel!

42:37.431 --> 42:38.420
Take them.

42:39.808 --> 42:41.719
( crowd screaming )

42:55.073 --> 42:56.404
Well, that little demonstration,

42:56.491 --> 42:58.573
thank you very much, Rygel,

42:58.660 --> 43:01.276
was fueled by the tannot root.

43:01.371 --> 43:06.991
The Others, the ones who
collect the tannot, they use it
to fuel that pulse rifle there.

43:07.377 --> 43:08.662
Peacekeepers?

43:08.754 --> 43:09.789
Yes.

43:09.880 --> 43:12.462
No. They say they only
use it for food.

43:12.549 --> 43:14.210
Crichton:
And the Peacekeepers never lie,
right, D'argo?

43:14.301 --> 43:16.383
Peacekeepers never lie?

43:16.470 --> 43:18.335
When the tannot is processed
and mixed

43:18.430 --> 43:21.137
with the right chemicals like
it is in Rygel's stomach...

43:21.224 --> 43:22.339
It makes Chakan oil.

43:22.434 --> 43:24.345
Do you understand what
that means?

43:24.436 --> 43:26.051
It fuels all Peacekeeper
weapons.

43:26.146 --> 43:29.058
So this happy plant that
you love so much?

43:29.149 --> 43:31.265
It's used to kill.

43:31.359 --> 43:33.850
They use it to imprison
and to enslave.

43:33.945 --> 43:37.233
Food. Weapons.
It doesn't matter.

43:37.324 --> 43:42.068
Our planet is already dying.

43:42.162 --> 43:43.618
My people are...

43:43.705 --> 43:46.538
Are enslaved by you.

43:46.625 --> 43:50.368
You think when this planet
is dead somehow you're
going to escape?

43:50.462 --> 43:52.748
That you're going to outrun
the Peacekeepers?

43:55.425 --> 44:00.340
Go ahead. Ask them what
your chances are.

44:00.430 --> 44:02.295
D'Argo:
He's right.

44:02.390 --> 44:05.848
You are not equipped to fight
the Peacekeepers.

44:05.936 --> 44:08.518
I can show you how to make
the Chakan oil.

44:08.605 --> 44:11.847
Volmae:
Look around you.

44:11.942 --> 44:13.728
We have no weapons.

44:13.819 --> 44:15.525
Make them.

44:15.612 --> 44:18.103
Hybin:
We once did.

44:19.658 --> 44:21.364
Guards!

44:25.831 --> 44:28.163
Hybin:
They have deserted you, Volmae.

44:28.250 --> 44:32.914
If we are to die as a people,
let us at least die fighting.

44:33.004 --> 44:36.246
There is nothing we can do.

44:36.341 --> 44:41.631
The Peacekeepers, they are
in control of me.

44:41.721 --> 44:44.007
They are in control of you.

44:44.099 --> 44:47.557
No, they're not.

44:47.644 --> 44:49.805
You are.

44:51.106 --> 44:53.097
You have the means.

44:53.191 --> 44:55.227
What are you going to
do about it?

44:56.027 --> 44:58.063
Volmae:
How?

44:58.822 --> 45:00.278
How can we?

45:00.365 --> 45:06.156
Hybin:
We will do it, one day
at a time.

45:07.414 --> 45:09.496
Crichton:
It's your decision.

45:09.583 --> 45:12.370
It can all start tomorrow.

45:18.383 --> 45:21.090
No.

45:24.306 --> 45:28.390
Tomorrow is...

45:29.311 --> 45:31.142
a rest day.

45:31.229 --> 45:34.392
A real rest day.

45:53.293 --> 45:54.999
(groaning)

45:55.921 --> 45:57.206
Got it.

45:57.297 --> 46:00.585
Hybin was right. This worm was
quite easy to coax out of you.

46:00.675 --> 46:03.291
Yeah, and that it would
hurt like hell.

46:03.386 --> 46:05.297
Like you've got anything
to complain about.

46:05.388 --> 46:07.424
You weren't frozen twice.

46:07.515 --> 46:09.847
Oh, silence. You're both fine.

46:09.935 --> 46:13.348
Anyway, get ready. Pilot wants
to starburst us out of here.

46:13.438 --> 46:14.974
Hey, Rygel?

46:15.065 --> 46:15.895
Mm-hmm?

46:15.982 --> 46:17.017
What's up with her?

46:17.108 --> 46:19.360
Oh, she thinks she's a
scientist now.

46:19.444 --> 46:20.900
False superiority.

46:20.987 --> 46:22.443
I am not a scientist.

46:22.530 --> 46:25.067
I am, however, what I have
always been and that
is superior.

46:25.158 --> 46:30.949
If I were warmer, I would
have an appropriately
venomous reply.

46:31.039 --> 46:32.279
Be warned.

46:32.374 --> 46:34.285
I owe you one.

46:39.339 --> 46:41.250
So, how you doing?

46:41.341 --> 46:43.332
Very well.

46:43.426 --> 46:47.840
It was nice for once to
triumph using my mind.

46:47.931 --> 46:50.673
It doesn'tjust have to be
this once, Aeryn.

46:50.767 --> 46:53.179
Thank you for your assistance.

46:55.021 --> 46:58.138
Thank you for yours.

46:58.233 --> 47:03.227
I'd wait and let D'argo come
to you when he's ready.

47:09.244 --> 47:13.328
Perhaps I'm never destined
to be happy.

47:13.415 --> 47:16.953
But you were, for five
glorious days.

47:19.963 --> 47:21.999
But it wasn't real.

47:24.384 --> 47:26.375
There are no guarantees, D'argo.

47:26.469 --> 47:32.180
We take each breath as if it
is our last and hope that
the air is sweet.

47:32.267 --> 47:35.304
I was going to...

47:35.395 --> 47:39.604
approach you at the
next celebration.

47:39.691 --> 47:42.353
And I would have accepted.

47:56.291 --> 48:01.627
When I was a boy, I dreamed of
two very different lives.

48:01.713 --> 48:03.829
Only two?

48:03.923 --> 48:05.788
I wanted hundreds.

48:06.634 --> 48:08.795
Two were enough.

48:09.846 --> 48:13.304
I would be a magnificent
warrior.

48:14.184 --> 48:19.053
Merciless in battle, fearless.

48:19.147 --> 48:21.638
The kind they write shintock
sonnets about.

48:21.733 --> 48:24.065
That is a healthy dream.

48:24.152 --> 48:27.360
I also wanted the simple life.

48:28.114 --> 48:32.733
Family, children...

48:32.827 --> 48:37.116
a frotash garden that I planted
with my own hands.

48:41.002 --> 48:44.415
I thought I'd found that.

48:44.506 --> 48:48.090
Those kinds of dreams cannot
be found, brave Luxan.

48:49.427 --> 48:51.292
You have to build them.

48:51.387 --> 48:58.884
And I promise you, your hands
are still strong and there
is plenty of time.
