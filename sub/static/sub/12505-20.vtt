00:06.006 --> 00:07.741
[Kaylie] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.775 --> 00:10.144
You literally
cannot afford to share
the spotlight with this girl.

00:10.178 --> 00:13.614
The only way to get her off the
team is to expose her anorexia.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.416
I wanted to give you this.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.185
It's your journal.
I took it.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.986
You are a horrible human being.

00:19.019 --> 00:19.987
[sobbing]

00:20.020 --> 00:21.155
You're drunk,
I'm taking you home.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.493
- You're gay.
- No.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.561
- You just like to kiss guys.
- And girls.

00:27.595 --> 00:31.332
[Ellen] I was presented with
clear evidence of inappropriate
conduct.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.600
Here it is.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.336
Did you have anything to do with
sending that training camp video

00:35.369 --> 00:36.337
to Ellen Beals?

00:36.370 --> 00:37.505
I did.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.140
I don't want anything
to do with your father

00:39.173 --> 00:42.610
or with you
ever again.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.678
- You OK?
- Can we get out of here?

00:44.712 --> 00:46.380
Lauren, stop!

00:46.414 --> 00:48.616
- [tires screeching]
- Whoa!

00:49.550 --> 00:50.784
[glass shattering]

00:55.055 --> 00:57.525
Excuse me, I got a call
about Lauren Tanner.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.692
She was in a car accident.

00:58.726 --> 00:59.727
I'll be right with you.

01:03.697 --> 01:06.267
- Are you her mother?
- What?

01:06.300 --> 01:08.302
Uh, Miss Tanner said
her mother was coming.

01:08.336 --> 01:09.637
Is she all right?

01:13.274 --> 01:14.675
You're here!

01:14.708 --> 01:16.644
Your daughter's very lucky.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.446
Most people don't walk
away from a collision like that

01:18.479 --> 01:19.680
with just a few bruises.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.716
Unfortunately her friend
wasn't as lucky.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.385
Max was with me.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.587
He has a concussion and
a fractured collar bone.

01:26.620 --> 01:30.090
We're going to keep him
overnight but Lauren
is free to go.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.759
- I'll just get her paperwork.
- Thank you.

01:31.792 --> 01:36.397
- Lauren, where's your father?
- I had them call you first.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.765
It was so awful!

01:37.798 --> 01:40.234
I took my eyes away from the
road for a second and then BAM!

01:40.268 --> 01:42.069
This huge SUV came
out of nowhere.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.404
I thought I was going to die!

01:43.437 --> 01:44.805
You should see my car,
it's practically totaled

01:44.838 --> 01:46.740
and the other guy
just walked away.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.242
Not a scratch.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.378
Lauren, why did you tell
them I'm your mother?

01:50.411 --> 01:53.414
Because I wanted you to come.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.448
I need you.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.850
I called Sasha.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.586
Did you tell him
about the video?

01:58.619 --> 01:59.753
You can't tell him, Summer.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.389
He can't find out it was me.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.623
I need to go to Worlds.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.792
It's the most
important event...

02:05.559 --> 02:07.261
What the hell did you do?

02:07.295 --> 02:11.199
I'm so sorry, Sasha. I didn't
mean to hurt you... or anyone.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.633
How could you do
something so stupid?

02:12.666 --> 02:14.101
What are you talking about?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.769
I'm talking about you getting
into a car with a boy

02:15.803 --> 02:17.805
the night before we
leave to go to Worlds

02:17.838 --> 02:19.840
and driving like
a reckless teenager.

02:19.873 --> 02:23.544
I'm sorry,
I made a mistake.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.679
[Sasha] You don't get to make
mistakes that risk your life.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.249
I didn't invest all this time
in you to have you throw it away
with

02:28.282 --> 02:30.618
impulsive, selfish behavior!

02:30.651 --> 02:31.619
I don't know what to say.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.421
You can tell me you'll
never disappoint me again.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.689
Because one more strike
and you are out.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.157
Do you understand me?

02:37.191 --> 02:38.192
I understand.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.234
You didn't tell him.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.569
No. I didn't tell him because
you're going to tell him.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.438
What? Why are you
doing this to me?

02:50.471 --> 02:51.639
You're gonna tell him.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.274
Before Worlds are over.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.544
And I suggest you do it
sooner than later.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.887
- Is she OK?
- Can she compete?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.456
Yes. And yes.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.524
So go home, get some rest.
We have a long flight tomorrow.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.760
- We just want to see her.
- And then we'll go straight
home.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.295
Well, see that you do.

03:19.833 --> 03:23.170
Hey, what are you doing here?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.238
What are you doing here?

03:24.272 --> 03:25.639
Lauren was in a car accident.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.542
- So was Max.
- [Lauren] We were together.

03:28.576 --> 03:29.810
Oh, thank God you're OK.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.447
Who was driving?

03:33.481 --> 03:36.584
Not Max, I hope.
He was drunk.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.652
I was driving.
And he wasn't that drunk.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.787
What were you doing?

03:39.820 --> 03:40.888
What do you think we were doing?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.391
We were going some
place we could be alone.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.659
- Is he OK?
- His collarbone is broken.

03:45.693 --> 03:48.529
Great. So he's not
going to Worlds.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.663
Nice going, Lauren.

03:49.697 --> 03:50.898
[woman] Excuse me.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.634
Are you the young woman who
was brought in with Max Spencer?

03:53.667 --> 03:54.735
That's me.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.871
He's sedated, but I think
he's asking for you.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.773
I'm sure he is.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.743
Be right back.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.779
You heard the nurse,
he's sedated.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.781
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.618
I should probably find his
doctor, see what's really up.

04:13.687 --> 04:17.758
- I am such an idiot.
- No, you aren't.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.794
- I told Max I loved him.
- Whoa. When?

04:20.828 --> 04:23.297
At the party.
It just...it just popped out.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.398
And what did he say?

04:24.432 --> 04:26.734
Nada. God, I feel
so embarrassed.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.569
Just because he didn't say
"I love you" back

04:28.602 --> 04:29.637
doesn't mean he doesn't feel it.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.239
He apparently left the party
to have sex with Lauren.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.274
Who feels the need to
rub that fact in my face

04:34.308 --> 04:37.345
the night before we leave for
the biggest meet of our lives.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.648
What are you doing here?

04:40.681 --> 04:42.383
Checking on my teammate.
Like you.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.485
- Isn't that what teammates do?
- Cut the crap.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.653
You're not fooling anyone.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.321
Is Lauren OK?

04:47.355 --> 04:48.789
Like you care.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.591
Aren't you the one who said
we should give her a break?

04:50.624 --> 04:51.725
I made a mistake.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.695
She doesn't care about
anybody but herself.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.631
Well, then she apparently
fits in perfectly around here.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.899
I've gotta call my mom.

05:02.603 --> 05:05.639
Look, I could've done a lot
of things with that journal.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.442
But I gave it back.
Because I wanted a friend.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.677
Because I wanted to be
part of a team.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.846
You stole my most
intimate possession.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.449
You will never be my friend.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.052
[scoffs]

05:19.086 --> 05:20.621
Fine.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.390
If that's the way
you want it,

05:22.423 --> 05:23.957
we'll go back to
everyone out for themselves.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.494
That's where I shine anyway.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.729
Good luck in Rio,
Kaylie.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.768
[heart monitor beeping]

05:43.777 --> 05:45.713
I'm right here, honey.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.082
What is it?
What can I do?

05:49.116 --> 05:52.586
[gasping]
Thank you for coming...

05:52.620 --> 05:54.755
I'm sorry...

05:56.056 --> 05:57.791
I'd never hurt you...

06:00.060 --> 06:02.129
[gasping]
Payson.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.605
[theme music]

06:33.561 --> 06:35.829
Mom, have you seen
my big duffle?

06:35.863 --> 06:39.633
Pay! We leave for
the airport in three hours.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.702
You've been working to go to
Worlds your whole life

06:41.735 --> 06:43.103
and you haven't even
started packing?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.538
Can you just spare me
the lecture

06:44.572 --> 06:46.707
and point me in the
direction of the duffle.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.976
What's wrong, honey?

06:49.009 --> 06:51.579
You're not feeling the pressure
of taking the endorsement, are
you?

06:51.612 --> 06:54.448
No. I know you and Dad still
fine.weird about it but I'm

06:54.482 --> 06:56.383
I'm going to kill it at
Worlds, end of story.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.752
You don't look fine.
You look like you're
about to burst.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.488
Why don't you check in
with one of the girls

07:00.521 --> 07:01.622
and get a little pep talk?

07:01.655 --> 07:02.623
Thank you, no.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.624
What about Max?

07:03.657 --> 07:04.692
Why don't you give him a call?

07:04.725 --> 07:05.959
I do not need to talk to Max.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.097
- Mornin', sweetie.
- Morning.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.001
Becca's still disappointed she's
not going with us to Brazil.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.671
Oh, well, frankly, it's a
luxury that we both get to go.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.774
The Rock is paying most of my
way but yours cost a big chunk

07:20.808 --> 07:24.512
of Payson's $25,000 advance.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.513
That's what it was for, right?

07:25.546 --> 07:27.781
That, and paying our
back bills and our mortgage.

07:27.815 --> 07:32.052
Yeah, I just can't believe
it's almost all gone.

07:32.085 --> 07:35.155
Along with Payson's college
scholarship eligibility.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.559
I thought that we agreed that
we'd put our faith in Payson

07:38.592 --> 07:40.894
and faith that she would
do well at Worlds,

07:40.928 --> 07:42.530
earning her bonus,
which is more than enough

07:42.563 --> 07:44.665
to pay for her
college education.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.835
We don't know if she would've
gotten a scholarship, anyway,
right?

07:47.868 --> 07:49.136
You're right.

07:49.169 --> 07:52.940
And I do have faith in Payson.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.142
- [doorbell rings]
- Will you grab that, Kay?

07:55.175 --> 07:56.810
Yep.

07:59.112 --> 08:02.049
Hi. Come in.
Please.

08:02.082 --> 08:05.085
I just wanted to check in on
the new US Team Captain.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.787
- Good morning, Marcus.
- Good morning, how are you?

08:06.820 --> 08:07.988
Good, thanks.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.591
How ya feeling, Kaylie?

08:10.624 --> 08:12.492
I feel great.
Ready to go.

08:12.526 --> 08:15.996
You know, we've been getting
unprecedented interview requests

08:16.029 --> 08:18.165
for Kaylie from
the foreign press in Rio.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.733
She's a star.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.235
[Marcus] They're going to ask
Trialsout your fall at World's

08:22.269 --> 08:26.239
and your subsequent absence.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.508
So, do you know what
you'll tell them?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.911
I injured my ACL.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.780
It's healed and
I'm ready to go.

08:32.813 --> 08:36.617
You understand why we can't
mention the eating disorder.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.720
And this strategy isn't
just for us, it's for you.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.855
Your scores would go down
because you'd be perceived
as weak.

08:41.889 --> 08:42.956
Yeah, that's the funny thing,

08:42.990 --> 08:45.759
because my recovery
has actually

08:45.793 --> 08:47.928
made me a stronger person...

08:47.961 --> 08:49.730
...and I'm sure
as a gymnast as well.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.499
Yeah, but it wouldn't
just affect your scores.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.701
You're the captain.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.637
See, you need to think of
how your whole team

08:56.670 --> 08:57.805
would be perceived.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.774
We need to keep the focus on
how strong this team is;

09:00.808 --> 09:02.576
how strong its captain is.

09:02.610 --> 09:06.013
I won't let the team down.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.181
You can count on me.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.686
[Salsa music]

09:23.196 --> 09:24.998
[reporter] Genji, over here!

09:25.032 --> 09:27.735
[reporters chattering
indistinctly]

09:27.768 --> 09:29.603
[reporter] Ivanka! Ivanka!

09:30.938 --> 09:33.306
[female reporter] Do you feel
the Americans are a threat?

09:36.644 --> 09:39.279
Every scenario predicts a
three-way race between China,

09:39.312 --> 09:41.581
Russia and the United States.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.284
And every scenario
predicts we finish third.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.186
Every scenario but mine.

09:46.219 --> 09:49.657
We're not here to give sound
bites, we are here to win.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.292
March up these stairs
like warriors,

09:52.325 --> 09:54.027
and enter that arena as a team.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.295
Speak to no one.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.330
I'll see you inside
after I get our credentials.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.365
Kaylie?

10:02.369 --> 10:05.639
- Payson, how do you feel?
- Kaylie, how's your ACL?

10:05.673 --> 10:08.041
[reporters interjecting]

10:08.075 --> 10:09.943
[reporter] Ivanka,
any challenge for you here

10:09.977 --> 10:11.178
other than Genji Cho?

10:11.211 --> 10:14.648
I do not think Genji
is a challenge for me.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.751
This is Russia's year to shine,
with me at the helm.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.655
Let's not forget who the
reigning World Champ is.

10:21.689 --> 10:24.925
And I plan on beating
both Ivanka and Genji Cho.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.295
But we each have our strengths,

10:28.328 --> 10:32.632
and on beam?
Ivanka, Genji, Kelly, watch out.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.135
- This is my year.
- Kaylie, bienvenida. Nice work.

10:35.168 --> 10:38.638
I promised the Spanish-language
press a few words.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.340
Kaylie, it's good to see you
back from your surgery.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.342
On your ACL?

10:42.375 --> 10:46.613
Oh, right, um... Yeah, I
actually didn't have surgery.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.915
I rested.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.382
[stammering]
There was physical therapy.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.852
But, um, mostly, I rested.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.788
[reporters interjecting]

10:54.822 --> 10:57.657
[reporter] Payson, Kaylie says
the US Team is strong and
united. Is that true?

10:57.691 --> 11:00.160
[reporter 2] Payson, is this
team tight enough to take on
China or Russia?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.707
Yeah, I just went shopping.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.675
I'm back at the hotel now.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.710
All right, Dad.
Talk to you later, bye.

11:16.744 --> 11:17.711
[phone beeps]

11:17.745 --> 11:20.781
Kaylie, I thought we
had this down.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.850
You were like a deer in the
headlights with those reporters.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.885
[sighing] I know. I'm sorry.
I've got it.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.954
I don't think you do. This is
a huge year for you, Kaylie,

11:26.987 --> 11:28.956
and a huge year
for USA gymnastics.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.390
We can't afford a scandal.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.092
What are you saying?

11:32.125 --> 11:34.728
I'm saying, I don't
want you talking to the press.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.830
- At all.
- Fine.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.032
The whole team is
depending on you.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.135
Your rooms will be ready soon.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.404
Please enjoy these
complimentary piña coladas.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.139
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.710
This is the nicest hotel
we've ever been to...

11:50.744 --> 11:54.214
...in our lives,
on Payson's dime.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.715
But Payson wanted us here.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.350
We're not on vacation.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.387
We're here to support her
in her dream, like we always do.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.822
I forgot to ask.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.423
Would you like to
book a couples massage?

12:03.456 --> 12:07.795
No. And here,
take these back.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.831
What's the matter?

12:10.864 --> 12:12.399
Are we really supporting her?

12:12.432 --> 12:14.802
Or are we selling her dream
to pay some bills?

12:14.835 --> 12:17.004
We did need that money, Kim.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.171
And we do believe in her.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.040
And not just us,
Healthy Bar does too.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.408
If Healthy Bar believed
in her so much,

12:21.441 --> 12:24.377
why are they only
throwing out $25,000

12:24.411 --> 12:27.247
until they see how she does?

12:27.280 --> 12:29.482
They're not sure
about her, Mark.
They're not.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.785
We may have just
thrown it all away...

12:31.819 --> 12:33.954
You are the Keelers.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.890
I thought I'd find you tomorrow,
but look, you're right here.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.192
- And you are?
- Katerina Paynich.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.760
Stanford University.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.897
Listen, I know that girls
who are on the Olympic path

12:43.931 --> 12:45.765
postpone college.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.868
Ordinarily, I wouldn't
recruit an athlete at Worlds.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.402
[stammering]
Recruit?

12:49.436 --> 12:52.139
Yes. I'm here to
recruit Payson Keeler

12:52.172 --> 12:54.174
for a Stanford
scholarship.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.475
Oh, God.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.977
I just want you to know,

12:57.010 --> 12:59.212
if Payson isn't quite
up to the Olympics,

12:59.246 --> 13:01.181
with her injury and all,

13:01.214 --> 13:02.916
she might have
a place at Stanford

13:02.950 --> 13:06.753
on our team,
on scholarship.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.556
Something to
think about.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.528
Oh God.
Oh God. Oh God.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.764
Oh God.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.867
It's OK, honey.
It's OK.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.268
Is it?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.937
Stanford University is
here to recruit Payson

13:23.971 --> 13:27.407
with a scholarship we can't
take because we took $25,000

13:27.440 --> 13:30.577
to pay some bills
and our mortgage.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.848
[announcer] Now's your chance
to meet Mr. Kobalt himself,

13:34.882 --> 13:37.550
Olympic gold medalist,
Austin Tucker.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.319
wearing the new summer line
of Kobalt sunglasses.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.388
[reporter] Austin!
Over here! Austin!

13:41.421 --> 13:42.489
Are you ready for Worlds?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.091
Do I look ready?

13:48.561 --> 13:50.397
I've still got a few days.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.233
The men don't compete
until the women are done.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.234
What about training?

13:54.267 --> 13:55.535
This is it, chief.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.937
I only make
it look easy.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.271
[female reporter] What can you
tell us about your love life?

13:58.305 --> 13:59.572
You have a girlfriend?

14:00.473 --> 14:03.977
If I had a girlfriend
could I do this?

14:14.888 --> 14:18.258
Sorry, ladies.
Gotta run.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.560
Kaylie.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.862
- Kaylie!
- Who are you?

14:22.896 --> 14:25.198
At the moment,
I'm... Mr. Kobalt.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.167
No, at the moment
you're an ass.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.835
Mr. Ass.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.439
What happened to that nice guy
that I danced with in Boulder?

14:32.472 --> 14:33.873
The guy who
made me think that I...

14:33.907 --> 14:35.475
That you're special?

14:35.508 --> 14:36.509
That I care about you?

14:36.543 --> 14:37.544
I'm right here.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.947
This Mr. Kobalt stuff?
It's an act.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.049
- It sells sunglasses.
- It's pathetic.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.517
My whole image is built on this,
Kaylie. My professional image.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.920
Well, if being a fake
is what it takes,

14:46.954 --> 14:48.088
then I'd rather
be poor.

14:48.121 --> 14:51.224
Says the rich girl.
Look, I'm not judging you

14:51.258 --> 14:54.227
but you're letting the whole
world think that you've been out
with an ACL injury.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.496
So don't act like I'm
the only fake around here.

14:56.529 --> 14:59.599
We all have to do
what we have to do.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.473
[samba music playing]

15:20.553 --> 15:22.055
[crowd cheering]

15:22.089 --> 15:24.457
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:24.491 --> 15:28.495
welcome to the Gymnastics
Championship of the World!

15:29.629 --> 15:31.898
[heroic music playing]

15:31.931 --> 15:33.566
Please welcome the teams

15:33.600 --> 15:36.569
representing today's
competing nations.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.207
The team from France.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.209
The team from Spain.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.911
The team from the
United States of America.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.480
The team from Sweden.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.283
The team from Russia.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.952
The team from Brazil.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.554
[sportscaster] Good afternoon,
everyone, and welcome to

15:54.587 --> 15:56.523
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.058
I'm Danny Crowle.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.127
And joining me today
Olympic gold medalists

16:00.160 --> 16:01.928
and gymnastics legends

16:01.961 --> 16:04.597
Nadia Comaneci
and Bart Conner.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.267
So, what can we expect from
today's qualifying competition?

16:07.300 --> 16:10.537
Well, the biggest challenge for
the US in the qualifying round
today will be Russia.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.339
Their star, Ivanka,

16:12.372 --> 16:14.607
is one of the most exciting
gymnasts we've seen

16:14.641 --> 16:15.608
since Genji Cho.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.444
And, speaking of Cho, Nadia,

16:17.477 --> 16:19.679
we're not going to see China
or Genji Cho today.

16:19.712 --> 16:22.549
That's right. China is competing
in tomorrow's qualifying round,

16:22.582 --> 16:25.418
so we won't see them go
head to head until the Finals.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.555
[Danny] The big question
for the US: Can they win the
team gold?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.223
[Bart] Well, they're
a great team,

16:30.257 --> 16:31.524
there's no question about it.

16:31.558 --> 16:34.261
But I fully expect to see
China and Russia

16:34.294 --> 16:35.595
competing for
the gold in the Finals.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.531
[Nadia] But the US could
definitely be in the mix for the
bronze.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.400
[Danny] And of course,
that's in the Finals.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.536
But, first, they have
to make it through the
qualifying round today.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.537
Bart, tell us how that works.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.274
Twenty-two teams compete today,
and 22 tomorrow.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.377
The top four from each day
advance to the Finals.

16:50.410 --> 16:54.381
[announcer] On beam, from
the United States of America,

16:54.414 --> 16:55.648
Lauren Tanner

16:58.151 --> 17:01.288
You are technically as good
or better than any gymnast
out here.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.390
The judges need to see that.
So, let them.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.557
No flourishes.
No embellishments.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.160
Just keep it simple.
Like we've practiced.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.229
- But, they've beaten me before.
- Short memory, Lauren.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.464
Forget it.
Put it behind you.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.700
[Sasha] We don't need
all of your sass today,

17:13.733 --> 17:16.369
just do the routine flawlessly.
Show them you're serious.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.470
Trust me.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.448
[crowd cheering]

17:28.481 --> 17:31.584
[Danny] We're told that
Coach Belov has added some
new combinations

17:31.618 --> 17:33.586
to Lauren's routine to
increase its point value.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.055
[Bart] No doubt in response
to recent losses

17:36.089 --> 17:38.425
to both Ivanka and Genji Cho.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.694
[Danny] Lauren always brings
a lot of sizzle and personality
to her routines.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.563
[Bart] That's why she's called
the "Queen of the Beam."

17:43.596 --> 17:45.565
This is gonna be
very entertaining.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.338
[Nadia] Oops, a little
balance check here.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.673
This is going to cost her
three-tenth deduction.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.542
Come on, Lauren.
You've got this.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.494
[Nadia] I'm surprised. I didn't
expect that from Lauren at all.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.496
[Bart] You're right.
No sparkle. No sass.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.298
Just a very
lackluster performance

18:18.331 --> 18:19.599
riddled with small mistakes.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.434
[Sasha] OK. No harm.

18:21.468 --> 18:25.438
[announcer] From Russia,
Ivanka Kirilenko.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.585
[Danny] Wow. Ivanka.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.088
It's hard to imagine anyone
doing better than that.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.391
Stunning.
Just flawless.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.393
[Danny] So, after one rotation,

18:46.426 --> 18:51.364
Russia is in the first position,
Spain second, and the US third.

18:51.398 --> 18:52.599
There's no reason
to get discouraged.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.767
We're in a good position and
still have three rotations left.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.135
Vault's up next.

18:56.169 --> 18:59.339
You should've
let me do it my way.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.484
[Announcer] On vault, from the
United States of America, Kaylie
Cruz.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.686
Good luck, you'll do great.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.888
You know what? Stop pretending
you're a team player.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.190
You're not.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.561
[Danny] Here's Kaylie Cruz,
reigning US Champion.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.396
It's been awhile since
we've seen her compete.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.366
That's right. She injured her
ACL at the World Trials.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.801
[Danny] Nadia, what impact
could that have on her vault?

19:28.835 --> 19:31.704
[Nadia] Well,
we are about to see.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.748
[Danny] Oh, a big step
on the landing.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.583
[Nadia] Also not centered.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.752
That's going to cost her
an eight-tenth deduction.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.721
[Bart] And this is the only
apparatus on which she's
competing today.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.758
Coach Belov has to be
expecting more from her.

19:51.791 --> 19:55.262
It's OK, Kaylie. Relax.
You'll get it this time, OK?

19:56.763 --> 19:58.331
C'mon, Kaylie,
you've got this!

19:59.266 --> 20:01.334
[Kelly] You've got this!

20:12.279 --> 20:14.281
[Bart] Oh, that's not
the vault she intended.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.682
[Nadia] That one-and-a-half
twist

20:15.715 --> 20:17.817
was supposed to be
a two-and-a-half twist.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.753
That's going to cost Kaylie
one point too.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.489
[Danny] And so,
after two rotations

20:22.522 --> 20:24.657
Team USA has dropped
into fourth place.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.559
[Bart] Wow. They can't
afford to drop any lower.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.361
Not if they hope
to qualify for the Finals.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.697
And, meanwhile,
Ivanka and the Russian Team

20:30.730 --> 20:32.799
maintains its
commanding lead.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.978
[cheering]

20:50.717 --> 20:54.921
[announcer] On floor,
from the United States
of America, Payson Keeler!

20:58.725 --> 21:01.428
[Danny] A year ago
many people believed
that Payson Keeler

21:01.461 --> 21:04.464
was poised to become the
top gymnast in the U.S.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.465
Then, tragedy.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.799
A broken back.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.802
- She's gonna do great.
- [woman] Healthy Bar loves her.

21:09.836 --> 21:14.273
[Danny] Today we'll see
if she can complete
a full comeback.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.608
[classical music plays]

21:18.778 --> 21:21.548
Something's wrong.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.783
She doesn't look like herself.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.424
[Nadia] She needed more height
to complete that move.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.826
She'll get a three-tenth
deduction for that.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.842
[Bart] This is not
the performance that
the US Team needed here.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.412
They could be finished.

21:52.445 --> 21:56.549
We did this, Mark.
She's not herself.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.651
We're the worst parents
on the planet.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.899
[Danny] So,
after three rotations,

22:12.932 --> 22:15.468
the US finds itself
in sixth place.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.405
Bart, they're gonna have to be
flawless in that final rotation.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.306
As well as perhaps
a little bit lucky.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.675
In order to make the top four
and make the Finals,

22:22.709 --> 22:24.444
they need Japan and Brazil,

22:24.477 --> 22:26.513
currently in fourth
and fifth positions,

22:26.546 --> 22:27.780
to stumble badly.

22:27.814 --> 22:28.948
I don't care
if you like her.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.650
I don't even care
if you hate her.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.819
But as long as Kelly Parker
is on this team

22:32.852 --> 22:34.086
you will damn well
support her.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.888
So stop acting like
a bloody prom queen

22:35.922 --> 22:37.724
and start acting
like a team captain.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.593
Our whole future
is on the line.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.529
He's right.
We're almost out.

22:42.562 --> 22:47.033
[announcer] On uneven bars,
from the United States
of America, Kelly Parker!

22:49.436 --> 22:52.839
You can do this, Kelly!
C'mon, you got it!

22:52.872 --> 22:54.574
- You've got this, Kelly!
- You can do it, Kelly!

22:54.607 --> 22:57.043
- Come on, Kelly!
- Whoo!

22:57.076 --> 22:58.945
- Come on, Kelly!
- Get it, girl.

23:02.582 --> 23:05.485
[up-tempo music plays]

23:41.688 --> 23:44.657
- [cheering]
- Nice!

23:53.566 --> 23:54.867
[Danny] As incredible
as it sounds,

23:54.901 --> 23:56.636
that performance
by Kelly Parker

23:56.669 --> 23:59.806
has just moved
the US Team into fourth place!

23:59.839 --> 24:01.841
[Bart] By the skin
of their teeth, they
move in to the Finals.

24:01.874 --> 24:05.812
But Coach Belov can't
be happy with the way
his team performed today.

24:13.686 --> 24:14.821
Hi, can I please
get room service?

24:14.854 --> 24:17.189
No. Hang that up,
and sit down.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.761
No food. No phones.
Nothing,

24:21.794 --> 24:23.763
until you figure out
what happened today.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.732
- Well, I think that we just...
- [Sasha] Don't tell me.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.700
Tell each other.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.869
The four of you might have
tossed your careers away today.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.437
And you have each other
to thank for that.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.806
So go on, share.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.543
We made the Finals.
Why are you punishing us?

24:36.576 --> 24:38.745
You barely made the Finals

24:38.778 --> 24:41.614
and you're not fit to carry
the sweats of China or Russia.

24:41.648 --> 24:44.216
You failed because you
couldn't work as a team.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.818
And you're not leaving
this room until you can.

24:45.852 --> 24:46.719
How?

24:46.753 --> 24:48.721
That's for you to figure out.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.697
OK, we all know
we sucked today.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.832
Speak for yourself.
I saved all of you.

24:59.866 --> 25:02.068
- You should be thanking me.
- The question is why.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.670
I almost died in a car accident,

25:03.703 --> 25:05.638
my boyfriend just got
out of the hospital,

25:05.672 --> 25:09.208
Sasha took away my sizzle.
Hate me. Can we go now?

25:09.241 --> 25:11.911
- I should've been captain.
- You know you don't deserve it.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.780
Do you wanna tell them,
or should I?

25:13.813 --> 25:15.047
She stole my journal.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.249
I gave it back,
and I apologized,

25:17.283 --> 25:19.586
but apparently
that counts for nothing.

25:19.619 --> 25:22.589
Makes you wonder why
anyone would bother
to apologize for anything.

25:22.622 --> 25:25.658
You Rock Girls always think
you're better than everyone.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.561
And some of us think that
we can just take whatever
and whoever we want.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.797
Look, I called dibs on Max
and you said it was OK.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.131
- Well, maybe it wasn't.
- Wow.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.166
Great job leading the team,
Captain Cruz.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.635
Shut up.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.637
And I never even
wanted to be captain!

25:37.670 --> 25:39.839
- Then why are you?
- Because they
named me captain...

25:39.872 --> 25:42.609
What were you doing
with him in the car anyways?

25:42.642 --> 25:45.678
[overlapping]

26:03.562 --> 26:06.265
You know what? I'll be the
first to say it. I'm sorry.

26:09.001 --> 26:13.806
I'm sorry I let myself become
an airhead like you three.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.876
I let a boy get to my head
and mess with my game.

26:16.909 --> 26:21.781
Aha. You do like Max.
Little Miss holier than thou.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.884
You know what?
I'm sorry, too.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.753
Sorry that you can't
handle boys and I can.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.255
Oh, by handle, you mean
prance around in your underwear?

26:29.288 --> 26:31.157
Just stop.

26:31.190 --> 26:35.161
You know, on my last rotation,
I knew you were fake-cheering
for me,

26:35.194 --> 26:36.896
but it felt good, anyway.

26:36.929 --> 26:41.033
I used to watch you guys
cheer each other on
and I was jealous.

26:41.067 --> 26:45.638
You were a real team
and I secretly wanted that.

26:45.672 --> 26:50.009
Until now, until hearing you
guys tear each other down.

26:50.042 --> 26:53.145
You're all even
bigger fakes than I am.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.751
She's right.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.887
Kelly Parker,
of all people, is right.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.790
What if it's over?

27:03.823 --> 27:07.727
Everything we've hoped for,
dreamed about...

27:07.760 --> 27:10.663
How could we let petty things
bring us down?

27:10.697 --> 27:12.765
But it's not.
It's not all petty.

27:12.799 --> 27:16.769
I talked my parents
into going against everything,

27:16.803 --> 27:19.338
everything that
they stood for.

27:19.371 --> 27:25.311
I told them
that it was OK for us
to sign away my eligibility.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.047
I promised them
it would be OK.

27:29.248 --> 27:32.752
God, they have to be
so wrecked right now.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.288
[sobbing]

27:36.322 --> 27:40.626
I wish my parents
would agonize about
letting me take sponsorships.

27:40.659 --> 27:45.664
My mom sold my eligibility
away when I was nine years old.

27:45.698 --> 27:46.966
You're lucky, Payson.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.268
You lost your scholarship
eligibility,

27:49.301 --> 27:52.671
but you have parents
that love you.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.745
I know that you're pissed
at Sasha right now

27:58.778 --> 28:01.914
for not letting you
do your sizzle your way,

28:01.948 --> 28:04.350
but you have to trust him.

28:04.383 --> 28:08.855
He cares about you
and believes in you.

28:10.790 --> 28:15.461
And, as for Max,
I apologize.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.998
You win.
You got the guy.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.834
No. You did.

28:21.868 --> 28:28.274
He likes you, Payson.
It's true.

28:28.307 --> 28:32.311
Do you know at the hospital,
he called out your name?

28:32.344 --> 28:34.747
He chose you.

28:34.781 --> 28:39.085
Whatever. If there's
anything I've learned today,
it's that it's about team.

28:39.118 --> 28:43.856
It's always about team.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.858
So can we
get through this?

28:48.027 --> 28:50.096
I don't think I can.

28:51.130 --> 28:54.133
Kaylie, I'm so sorry
I took your journal.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.435
I'm no better than my mom,
and you should hate me.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.838
No. It's not that.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.840
It's just...

29:00.873 --> 29:05.244
[sighs] You guys are
telling all your secrets
and coming clean.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.814
I can't.

29:07.847 --> 29:11.150
I have a disease,
and the NGO,

29:11.183 --> 29:12.819
they won't let me
talk about it.

29:12.852 --> 29:16.923
And I get it, but it would
just help so much if I could.

29:16.956 --> 29:20.793
If I could be honest, like all
of you are being right now...

29:20.827 --> 29:22.761
- Why can't you?
- You know why.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.330
This sport
is judged on perception.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.933
Anorexics are considered weak.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.235
My scores will go down
and so will all of yours,

29:29.268 --> 29:30.769
because I'm the captain.

29:30.803 --> 29:34.240
- But that's not fair.
- That's reality.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.509
Don't beat yourself up
about it, Kaylie.

29:37.543 --> 29:40.813
Some secrets
are best kept silent.

29:40.847 --> 29:42.481
Just know that we're
right here with you.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.853
Whatever you decide to do,
we've got your back.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.229
Kaylie, we agreed.
No more press.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.870
Thank you all for coming.

30:03.903 --> 30:08.274
I'm Kaylie Cruz,
US Team Captain, and...

30:08.307 --> 30:09.775
And we're her team,
who support

30:09.808 --> 30:12.478
and believe
in her 100%.

30:15.948 --> 30:20.486
I'm here because
I want to tell you all...

30:20.519 --> 30:22.588
...I have an eating disorder.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.157
There was never
an ACL injury.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.860
I lied.

30:27.894 --> 30:31.430
And it's taken me a while
to realize there's no shame

30:31.463 --> 30:33.900
in admitting
you have a problem

30:33.933 --> 30:35.101
or in getting help.

30:35.134 --> 30:38.004
I have,
and I'm better.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.805
I will always struggle
with anorexia,

30:39.838 --> 30:43.075
but my team's
behind me.

30:45.311 --> 30:49.415
And after going through this,
I am a better gymnast.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.817
- [Marcus] After this?
- [Kaylie] I refuse to say
I'm not.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.987
- They're done.
- [applause]

30:56.155 --> 30:59.926
[woman vocalizing]

31:07.466 --> 31:10.602
[up-tempo music]

31:25.451 --> 31:26.953
[Danny] Team U.S.A.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.521
On qualifying day
they appeared to be unfocused,

31:29.555 --> 31:32.224
undisciplined and performed
without inspiration.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.625
Yet, here they are.

31:33.659 --> 31:37.163
[Danny] It's clear
this is a dramatically
different U.S Team today.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.932
Energy, focus, desire.

31:39.966 --> 31:41.467
I really like
what I'm seeing.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.569
[Danny] The Chinese Team,
led by Genji Cho,

31:43.602 --> 31:45.871
dominated in the
qualifying round yesterday.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.207
Is there anyone
in today's Finals

31:48.240 --> 31:50.009
that can keep them
from taking Team Gold?

31:50.042 --> 31:52.644
Well, injuries can heal
and routines can be adjusted,

31:52.678 --> 31:55.914
but at this point
I can't imagine anyone
other than the Russians

31:55.948 --> 31:58.050
that have a prayer
of challenging
the Chinese.

31:58.084 --> 32:01.053
The US Team will need
to be near perfect
from here on out

32:01.087 --> 32:02.554
if they hope to win
a team medal today.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.890
Lauren, you're up next on beam.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.158
Now, I know you
haven't been pleased
with the way I've had you...

32:06.192 --> 32:07.526
I have to tell
you something.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.529
We've all been honest
with each other.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.332
It's time that
I be honest, too.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.400
Go on.

32:20.606 --> 32:25.044
The video
of Payson kissing you,

32:26.312 --> 32:29.681
I found it
in the practice cam,

32:29.715 --> 32:34.286
and I was afraid that,

32:34.320 --> 32:36.622
that you would take
Summer away from me,

32:38.724 --> 32:41.360
so...

32:41.393 --> 32:43.962
...so I sent it
to Ellen Beals.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.666
[sobbing] It was me, Sasha.

32:47.699 --> 32:51.970
I did it. I'm so sorry.

32:52.004 --> 32:54.140
Please forgive me.

33:02.014 --> 33:06.185
[announcer] On beam,
from the United States
of America,

33:06.218 --> 33:09.288
- Lauren Tanner.
- [cheering]

33:21.167 --> 33:22.701
The judges have seen
your technique.

33:25.071 --> 33:28.307
Today, I want you to give
them the whole package.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.110
Wow them.

33:32.378 --> 33:33.679
I want everyone
in this arena

33:33.712 --> 33:36.282
to see how magnificent
you can be.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.984
Aren't you angry
with me?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.352
Short memory.

33:41.653 --> 33:44.456
Let this be
a new start for us.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.358
I forgive you.

33:46.392 --> 33:49.661
Is this because
you need me to win?

33:49.695 --> 33:54.633
No. This is because
I care about you.

33:54.666 --> 33:57.636
Because I know your life
challenges you,

33:57.669 --> 34:00.606
and because I know
you are better than
you show yourself to be.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.608
Lauren,

34:02.641 --> 34:06.678
I know you have the
capacity to be a better
gymnast than you know.

34:06.712 --> 34:09.081
But more than that?

34:09.115 --> 34:14.453
I know you have the capacity
to be a better human being
than you know.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.364
Now you go get them.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.434
You show them
the Lauren sizzle.

34:30.536 --> 34:33.572
[up-tempo music plays]

35:25.657 --> 35:29.495
[cheering]

35:30.729 --> 35:32.531
[Bart] I don't know what
Coach Belov told his team,

35:32.564 --> 35:34.200
but whatever it is,
it's working!

35:34.233 --> 35:36.768
[Danny] And with that routine,
Lauren Tanner has moved the US

35:36.802 --> 35:39.671
into fourth place
behind China and Russia.

35:39.705 --> 35:43.409
[Nadia] Amazing.
The US is in position
to win a team medal.

35:43.442 --> 35:49.181
[announcer] On vault,
from United States
of America, Payson Keeler.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.183
She's going for a clean,
simple vault.

35:51.217 --> 35:55.321
Her best chance for
an individual medal
is on floor.

35:55.354 --> 35:59.491
And when you do, please Pay,
make it the floor of your life.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.502
[cheering]

36:15.907 --> 36:19.245
[Danny] This doesn't look good.
Payson Keeler is down.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.623
OK, talk to me.
How does it feel?

36:31.657 --> 36:33.459
Numb.

36:34.326 --> 36:36.528
All right, all right.

36:36.562 --> 36:39.831
[sighs] It's not broken,
but we need a doctor to see it.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.433
Come on.

36:41.467 --> 36:44.336
[grunting]

36:45.837 --> 36:47.306
- I'm benching you.
- No.

36:47.339 --> 36:48.707
I still have one more vault.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.409
You can barely stand.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.478
How do you plan on
sticking the landing?

36:52.511 --> 36:55.481
On one leg, I guess.

36:55.514 --> 36:58.650
Look, there's no way
I'm going to be able
to compete on floor.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.852
I have to do this, Sasha.

37:00.886 --> 37:04.690
For my parents.
I owe them this, OK?

37:04.723 --> 37:07.459
Please.

37:07.493 --> 37:09.661
OK.

37:20.606 --> 37:23.509
As your captain
and your friend,

37:23.542 --> 37:25.311
give it all
you've got.

37:25.344 --> 37:29.281
Today, you own the vault.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.459
[rock music plays]

38:13.492 --> 38:15.527
[cheering]

38:18.764 --> 38:20.832
[Danny] I don't believe it!

38:20.866 --> 38:24.336
Payson Keeler
sticks a one-legged landing!

38:24.370 --> 38:26.572
[Nadia] Absolutely
the best vault in the meet.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.374
I haven't seen
anything like that

38:28.407 --> 38:30.476
since Kerri Strug
in the '96 Olympics.

38:30.509 --> 38:33.545
[Danny] And that should move
the US Team past Russia

38:33.579 --> 38:36.348
and into second place
behind China.

38:37.416 --> 38:41.487
[announcer] On floor,
from China, Genji Cho!

38:41.520 --> 38:43.922
[rock music plays]

38:51.497 --> 38:53.732
[Danny] Unless the United States
can do something spectacular

38:53.765 --> 38:57.002
it looks like China's
going home with the gold.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.404
[Bart] With Payson Keeler
injured

38:58.437 --> 39:01.039
I just don't think
the United States
has any answers.

39:03.074 --> 39:06.612
I'm glad you are better,
Kaylie Cruz.

39:08.447 --> 39:09.948
I'm putting you on floor.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.483
Payson's ankle
isn't strong enough.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.084
You can do this.

39:16.455 --> 39:19.558
Not today.
I don't know why,
I just feel off.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.493
You should use Kaylie.

39:21.527 --> 39:23.061
She can bring it
home for us.

39:23.094 --> 39:27.666
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes I do. For the team.

39:27.699 --> 39:31.470
You're on fire today
and I'm not. So go.
Get it.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.742
OK.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.513
[announcer] Kaylie Cruz
of the United States

39:41.547 --> 39:44.349
is substituting
for Payson Keeler
on the floor.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.486
- [woman] Come on, Kaylie.
- [cheering]

39:51.389 --> 39:53.091
[Danny] Just yesterday
Kaylie announced

39:53.124 --> 39:54.860
she's been battling
an eating disorder.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.597
Nadia, will that have any
impact on her scoring today?

39:58.630 --> 40:01.700
[Nadia] It shouldn't,
but judges are only human.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.034
[Bart] It's heartbreaking.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.937
Team USA was poised
to make the comeback
of a decade.

40:05.971 --> 40:09.508
And now?
It's hard to see it.

40:09.541 --> 40:13.445
[mid-tempo music plays]

41:29.621 --> 41:32.090
- Yeah!
- [cheering]

41:34.025 --> 41:37.696
[Danny] I don't believe it.
Could that have done it?

41:37.729 --> 41:40.265
[Bart] Could be.
The scores are being tabulated.

41:45.804 --> 41:50.709
[all chanting] USA! USA! USA!

41:59.150 --> 42:02.621
Oh, my God!
Team USA wins the gold!

42:04.189 --> 42:06.524
With that performance,
the US has just pulled off

42:06.558 --> 42:09.895
the comeback of a lifetime!

42:09.928 --> 42:12.197
[announcer] And accepting
their gold medals,

42:12.230 --> 42:15.767
the team from the
United States of America!

42:17.068 --> 42:19.237
[Danny] Did you two think
we'd be seeing the US

42:19.270 --> 42:21.072
getting the gold medal today?

42:21.106 --> 42:23.241
[Nadia] I honestly didn't.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.844
[Bart] It was beautiful to see
them coming together as a team.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.647
These young ladies have been
training their whole lives,

42:28.680 --> 42:29.915
dreaming of this moment,

42:29.948 --> 42:32.684
and today,
their dreams came true.

42:32.718 --> 42:37.122
["The Star-Spangled Banner"
plays]

42:59.244 --> 43:01.780
[acoustic music plays]

43:16.127 --> 43:18.697
I'm so proud of you, honey.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.638
Max.

43:26.672 --> 43:28.840
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be
in the hospital?

43:28.874 --> 43:30.041
Are you kidding?

43:30.075 --> 43:31.576
You think I'd miss
my Grrrl Bar client

43:31.609 --> 43:33.211
in the most heroic
moment of the year?

43:33.244 --> 43:35.246
Really.

43:35.280 --> 43:38.016
Why are you here?

43:38.049 --> 43:40.218
I'm so proud of you.

43:42.721 --> 43:43.989
You inspire me.

43:44.022 --> 43:46.324
I think I might be
in love with you.

43:48.359 --> 43:51.663
- There's one more thing.
- Stop talking. I don't care.

43:58.036 --> 44:00.205
Austin Tucker!
There isn't anything between you
and Kaylie Cruz, is there?

44:00.238 --> 44:03.174
Oh, Mr. Kobalt doesn't
have a girlfriend, right?

44:03.975 --> 44:06.011
Yes, yes I do.

44:06.044 --> 44:07.645
If she'll have me.

44:08.747 --> 44:10.982
And she and I would like
a little privacy.

44:19.024 --> 44:21.292
Excuse me, love bird.

44:26.364 --> 44:27.999
To our girls.
