<i>Richard Cypher,</i>

00:22.821 --> 00:25.022
Fear not,
Sister Portia.

00:25.023 --> 00:26.457
The Keeper
of the Underworld

00:26.458 --> 00:28.492
will reward you
for your sacrifice.

00:28.493 --> 00:31.295
I have no fear.

00:31.296 --> 00:33.430
I long only for his embrace.

00:33.431 --> 00:35.065
It will soon be yours.

( <i>mysterious theme playing</i> )

01:06.431 --> 01:08.198
( gasps )

01:11.436 --> 01:12.870
Sister Nicci?

01:16.641 --> 01:19.376
You've brought me back.

01:19.377 --> 01:21.478
The Mother Confessor
still walks,

01:21.479 --> 01:24.181
and only your han
is strong enough to kill her.

01:24.182 --> 01:27.651
I think I know
a way to find her.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.620
(Richard)
How about some rosemary?

01:32.991 --> 01:35.626
Ooh, good.

01:35.627 --> 01:37.328
What would your mothers say?

01:37.329 --> 01:40.264
About our ability to create
ambrosial delights

01:40.265 --> 01:42.833
from roots and herbs
scavenged from the wilderness?

01:42.834 --> 01:45.970
No, about two strong men
fussing over the fire

01:45.971 --> 01:47.471
while a woman chops wood
for them.

01:47.472 --> 01:50.341
(Zedd)
On a good team,
each member performs

01:50.342 --> 01:51.842
in accordance
with their abilities,

01:51.843 --> 01:54.411
and judging by your recent
attempts to produce

01:54.412 --> 01:57.014
something approximating
corn cake,

01:57.015 --> 01:58.949
it might be best for you
to stick to chopping.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.654
( creatures screeching )

02:03.655 --> 02:05.556
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

02:05.557 --> 02:07.157
( screeching )

02:07.158 --> 02:08.525
( Kahlan screams )

02:08.526 --> 02:10.627
(Richard)
Kahlan!

02:10.628 --> 02:12.663
( Kahlan screaming )

02:12.664 --> 02:14.031
Richard, wait!

02:14.032 --> 02:14.965
Hyah!

02:16.534 --> 02:20.337
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

02:20.338 --> 02:22.439
( Kahlan grunting )

02:23.975 --> 02:26.410
(Richard)
Kahlan!

02:30.749 --> 02:33.317
They flew over that ridge.
I can't see which way they went.

02:33.318 --> 02:35.119
Gars are hungry beasts.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.254
Only trained ones save
their prey until later.

02:37.255 --> 02:39.757
And the only trained Gars
in the Midlands

02:39.758 --> 02:41.992
are the personal pets
of the Margrave of Rothenberg,

02:41.993 --> 02:44.228
the richest man
in all the territories.

02:44.229 --> 02:46.563
Rothenberg is days
from here,

02:46.564 --> 02:48.699
Kahlan could be dead
by the time we get there.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.834
If the Margrave had ordered
his Gars to kill her,

02:50.835 --> 02:52.202
she'd be dead already.

02:52.203 --> 02:54.071
He must want her alive
for some reason.

02:54.072 --> 02:55.706
Well, let's go before
he changes his mind.

02:55.707 --> 02:57.074
I must warn you.

02:57.075 --> 02:59.677
The ancient Lords of Rothenberg
had a powerful spell

02:59.678 --> 03:02.413
of protection cast
on the walls of their realm.

03:02.414 --> 03:05.249
Within those walls,
no magic has any power.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.217
Not my wizardry,
not Cara's Agiels--

03:07.218 --> 03:09.286
Not Kahlan's confessor power.

03:09.287 --> 03:10.354
Hyah!

03:12.257 --> 03:13.624
(Margrave)
Herald.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.426
Margrave?

03:15.427 --> 03:18.195
Do you know
who this woman is?

03:20.031 --> 03:21.231
Yes, Your Majesty.

03:21.232 --> 03:24.134
I saw her once, sitting
in judgment in Aydindril.

03:24.135 --> 03:27.705
She is Kahlan Amnell,
the Confessor.

03:27.706 --> 03:29.306
Send word to our friend
that we're ready

03:29.307 --> 03:31.475
to complete
our agreement.

03:31.476 --> 03:33.143
(Kahlan)
What agreement?

03:33.144 --> 03:34.611
Who are you talking about?

03:34.612 --> 03:37.548
You'll find out soon enough.

03:37.549 --> 03:40.317
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

03:40.318 --> 03:42.152
Take her to the dungeon.

03:42.153 --> 03:43.954
( grunting )

03:47.826 --> 03:49.059
You're a fool if you think

03:49.060 --> 03:50.694
the Seeker isn't
going to find me.

03:50.695 --> 03:52.162
He'll never get here in time.

03:52.163 --> 03:53.630
( grunting )

03:53.631 --> 03:55.966
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

04:02.006 --> 04:04.842
( prisoners screaming
in distance )

04:04.843 --> 04:06.677
( Kahlan grunts )

04:06.678 --> 04:08.479
( panting )

04:08.480 --> 04:10.147
( door locks )

04:13.184 --> 04:14.251
( grunts )

04:16.988 --> 04:19.923
Nobody has ever escaped
the Margrave's dungeon.

04:22.627 --> 04:25.529
There's always a way out.

04:25.530 --> 04:27.564
You don't know the Margrave.

04:27.565 --> 04:29.199
I take it you do.

04:30.769 --> 04:31.935
I'm his wife.

04:37.475 --> 04:39.710
What are you doing
in his dungeon?

04:39.711 --> 04:41.612
My husband has grown
tired of me,

04:41.613 --> 04:43.213
and wishes to marry another.

04:43.214 --> 04:44.782
But the Law
of Right and Good

04:44.783 --> 04:47.417
forbids anyone to break
their marriage vows

04:49.087 --> 04:51.121
so he has
sentenced me to death.

04:51.122 --> 04:53.891
On what grounds?

04:53.892 --> 04:56.093
He needs none.

04:56.094 --> 04:57.761
According to the law,

04:57.762 --> 05:00.130
the Margrave's word
is final and absolute.

05:00.131 --> 05:03.634
I'm Kahlan Amnell,
the Mother Confessor,

05:03.635 --> 05:05.369
and the only laws
in the Midlands

05:05.370 --> 05:07.638
are the ones
that I enforce.

05:07.639 --> 05:10.040
I've never heard of this
Law of Right and Good.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.944
But I swear to you on
the Creator and all the Spirits

05:13.945 --> 05:15.679
that I am going
to get us out of here.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.980
No.

05:16.981 --> 05:19.183
When the Margrave chooses
his new bride,

05:19.184 --> 05:21.885
his executioner is going
to take me to the block.

05:23.221 --> 05:25.155
And I must accept that.

05:27.058 --> 05:29.393
( chanting in ancient tongue )

05:35.900 --> 05:37.167
Sister Nicci.

05:37.168 --> 05:38.769
You spent
your life praying

05:38.770 --> 05:40.604
to be united
with the Keeper.

05:40.605 --> 05:43.607
And now here you are,
back in the world of the living.

05:43.608 --> 05:46.977
My sisters
brought me back

05:46.978 --> 05:49.279
so I could do what you
and your minions

05:49.280 --> 05:51.782
failed to do,
time and again:

05:51.783 --> 05:53.951
capture the Mother Confessor.

05:53.952 --> 05:55.886
If you have
the Mother Confessor,

05:55.887 --> 05:59.623
then why are you not laying
her lifeless body at my feet?

05:59.624 --> 06:02.059
I sent word to the Margrave
of Rothenberg,

06:02.060 --> 06:04.628
asking him to send
his Gars for her.

06:04.629 --> 06:06.230
She's at the Margrave's dungeon,

06:06.231 --> 06:08.599
a place where the Seeker
and his friends

06:08.600 --> 06:11.802
will be unable
to use magic to rescue her.

06:11.803 --> 06:15.405
Very clever.

06:15.406 --> 06:17.841
So clever, in fact,
that I'm left wondering

06:17.842 --> 06:20.944
what you might possibly
need from me.

06:20.945 --> 06:24.848
In exchange for turning
the Mother Confessor over to me,

06:24.849 --> 06:26.717
the Margrave wants a guarantee,

06:26.718 --> 06:29.887
signed in the Keeper's blood,

06:29.888 --> 06:31.755
that when the Keeper
puts an end to all life,

06:31.756 --> 06:35.759
he and his court will be granted
eternal immunity from death.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.094
Do you think the Keeper

06:37.095 --> 06:40.230
is interested
in almost winning?

06:40.231 --> 06:44.601
Remember the Prophecy,
Darken Rahl.

06:44.602 --> 06:46.937
As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

06:46.938 --> 06:50.107
the Keeper is doomed to fail.

06:50.108 --> 06:51.708
A handful of lives
isn't many to spare,

06:51.709 --> 06:53.343
in exchange for millions.

06:54.612 --> 06:58.448
I will convey your message
to the Keeper,

06:58.449 --> 07:01.885
and persuade him
to accept your terms.

07:03.955 --> 07:06.690
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

07:10.221 --> 07:12.155
We could tunnel under
the ramparts there.

07:12.156 --> 07:13.957
They don't look more
than 20 hands thick.

07:13.958 --> 07:16.426
(Zedd)
We have no time
for tunneling.

07:16.427 --> 07:18.895
There's almost
no time at all.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.397
With the help
of a listening spell,

07:20.398 --> 07:23.033
I've done some eavesdropping
outside the walls.

07:23.034 --> 07:25.935
There's a rumor that
the Margrave has struck a deal

07:25.936 --> 07:27.370
with the Sisters
of the Dark.

07:28.639 --> 07:29.973
What kind of deal?

07:29.974 --> 07:32.108
Eternal life for the Margrave
and his court,

07:32.109 --> 07:33.943
in exchange
for Kahlan's head.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.547
We have to get in there.

07:38.949 --> 07:40.283
We can get over the wall.

07:40.284 --> 07:41.685
And once we're inside?

07:41.686 --> 07:43.019
It'd be
three against hundreds,

07:43.020 --> 07:45.288
with no magic
at our disposal.

07:45.289 --> 07:47.557
I believe
there's another way.

07:47.558 --> 07:50.160
Apparently, the Margrave
is about to choose a new bride,

07:50.161 --> 07:51.428
to share with him
the eternity

07:51.429 --> 07:54.164
he is purchasing
with Kahlan's life.

07:54.165 --> 07:56.066
Every high-born beauty
in the Midlands

07:56.067 --> 07:57.434
has been competing
to be chosen

07:57.435 --> 07:59.269
but the Margrave
has narrowed the selection

07:59.270 --> 08:02.338
to the Countess of Dunstable
and the Princess of Thryce.

08:02.339 --> 08:05.008
They'll both be arriving
at the palace tomorrow morning,

08:05.009 --> 08:06.776
where the Margrave--
Why are you telling us

08:06.777 --> 08:08.478
the local gossip,
when Kahlan is going to be

08:08.479 --> 08:10.013
handed over to
the Sisters of the Dark?

08:10.014 --> 08:12.615
Because the Margrave has known
the countess for years,

08:12.616 --> 08:16.386
but he knows the princess only
by her glowing reputation.

08:16.387 --> 08:18.722
He has never actually
laid eyes on her.

08:18.723 --> 08:21.725
If the princess
and her retinue

08:21.726 --> 08:23.493
happened to be intercepted
on their way,

08:23.494 --> 08:25.328
we could arrive
at the palace in their place,

08:25.329 --> 08:27.564
and be welcomed
with open arms.

08:27.565 --> 08:29.599
All we'd need is a princess.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.600
Hm.

08:38.876 --> 08:40.110
Oh, no. Mm-mm.

08:40.111 --> 08:41.277
Cara, it could work.

08:41.278 --> 08:43.313
I'm no princess.
(Zedd) No, you're not.

08:43.313 --> 08:45.048
Especially not this princess,

08:45.049 --> 08:47.617
who is renowned
for her delicacy, her charm,

08:47.618 --> 08:50.620
and most especially
her virtue.

08:50.621 --> 08:52.422
But the impossibility
of the task

08:52.423 --> 08:54.657
must not prevent us
from undertaking it.

08:56.560 --> 08:57.994
( all chattering )

08:57.995 --> 09:00.463
( Zedd chanting
in ancient tongue )

09:08.639 --> 09:10.240
Her Serene Highness,

09:10.241 --> 09:13.076
Princess Lorelyn of Thryce.

09:15.412 --> 09:16.746
I think we should dig
the tunnel.

09:18.082 --> 09:19.482
Prince Roderick,

09:19.483 --> 09:22.452
renowned for his golden locks,
and his prowess.

09:22.453 --> 09:24.254
He doesn't look
like much of a fighter.

09:24.255 --> 09:25.622
Not that kind of prowess.

09:25.623 --> 09:27.657
His reputation is not
the only thing

09:27.658 --> 09:29.025
that precedes him
into the room.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.660
If the stories are true,

09:30.661 --> 09:32.762
he's won the favors
of a thousand women.

09:32.763 --> 09:34.931
Wives have been known
to poison their husbands

09:34.932 --> 09:37.467
for a chance to be
number 1001.

09:37.468 --> 09:39.536
And I shall impersonate

09:39.537 --> 09:41.938
the princess' beloved aunt,

09:41.939 --> 09:45.375
the Dowager Duchess
of Thryce.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.977
Zedd, I thought you couldn't use
magic to change our appearance.

09:47.978 --> 09:50.280
The spell would dissolve
once we passed the gates.

09:50.281 --> 09:52.682
I don't need magic
to perpetrate the illusion,

09:52.683 --> 09:55.418
just a little color on my cheeks
and my skills as a thespian.

09:57.454 --> 10:00.223
Now, to find a quiet place
where our royal friends

10:00.224 --> 10:03.726
can take a nice
long magical nap.

10:03.727 --> 10:07.564
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

10:07.565 --> 10:09.399
What's that?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.701
Chamomile, quince
and a touch of saffron.

10:11.702 --> 10:15.138
My mother's recipe for putting
a little gold in her tresses.

10:15.139 --> 10:17.640
Should work
just as well on you.

10:17.641 --> 10:20.910
Would that your transformation
were as simple.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.580
You must
unlearn everything

10:23.581 --> 10:25.748
you know and believe.

10:25.749 --> 10:28.551
To begin with,
you must never look any man

10:28.552 --> 10:30.320
in the palace directly
in the eye.

10:30.321 --> 10:33.389
You must never speak
your mind on any subject,

10:33.390 --> 10:35.959
but always
defer to the opinion

10:35.960 --> 10:38.161
of your
masculine betters.

10:38.162 --> 10:39.395
There's no such thing.

10:39.396 --> 10:41.564
Exactly the attitude

10:41.565 --> 10:44.634
you must abandon.

10:44.635 --> 10:45.902
Most challenging of all,

10:45.903 --> 10:47.270
when in the Margrave's
presence,

10:47.271 --> 10:50.073
a lady must always,
without exception,

10:50.074 --> 10:52.775
speak in rhyming
dactylic tetrameter.

10:52.776 --> 10:54.911
In what?

10:54.912 --> 10:56.512
A poetic meter,

10:56.513 --> 10:59.415
in which each line
consists of four groups

10:59.416 --> 11:01.117
of three-syllable phrases
with the accent

11:01.118 --> 11:02.352
on the first syllable,

11:02.353 --> 11:04.587
and the first syllable
of the fourth phrase

11:04.588 --> 11:07.390
of each line must rhyme
with the corresponding syllable

11:07.391 --> 11:09.659
on the line before it.
Hm?

11:11.996 --> 11:14.764
I passionately wish
I were.

11:14.765 --> 11:18.434
I shall demonstrate
by example.

11:20.437 --> 11:22.839
If the Margrave
were to ask you

11:22.840 --> 11:26.809
"Hasn't the weather
been nice lately?"

11:26.810 --> 11:28.244
You might answer,

11:28.245 --> 11:31.547
"The night was a tumult
of thunder and storm,

11:31.548 --> 11:34.651
but ever since then
it's been lovely and warm."

11:34.652 --> 11:37.053
Care to try?

11:37.054 --> 11:40.023
There is no way I'm going
to win this competition.

11:40.024 --> 11:41.758
You don't have to win.

11:41.759 --> 11:43.693
You just need to keep us
in the game long enough

11:43.694 --> 11:46.296
for Richard to find
Kahlan and rescue her.

11:46.297 --> 11:47.997
( <i>staff thumps on floor</i> )

11:47.998 --> 11:51.701
Her Luminous Majesty,
the Princess of Thryce.

11:51.702 --> 11:55.638
( chamber music playing )

11:57.308 --> 11:59.876
( crowd murmuring )

12:07.084 --> 12:08.584
( staff thumps )

12:08.585 --> 12:12.088
(Herald)
Her brother,
Prince Roderick the Golden.

12:14.858 --> 12:16.159
( speaking indistinctly )

12:21.765 --> 12:23.166
( staff thumps )

12:23.167 --> 12:27.003
Her Eminence, the Dowager
Duchess of Thryce.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.781
( staff thumps )

12:38.782 --> 12:40.683
(Herald)
Her Celestial Munificence,

12:40.684 --> 12:44.053
the Countess Drucilla
of Dunstable.

12:44.054 --> 12:48.291
And her companion, the
Viscountess of Wollingsworth.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.267
Welcome, Your Highnesses.

13:08.145 --> 13:11.080
( <i>courtly theme playing</i> )

13:13.083 --> 13:15.051
(Margrave)
Drucilla, my friend,

13:15.052 --> 13:17.720
is your father the count
feeling any better?

13:17.721 --> 13:20.089
If at the Creator's feet
I did kneel,

13:20.090 --> 13:22.458
and she were to grant me
the power to heal,

13:22.459 --> 13:25.561
no greater balm
could my father desire,

13:25.562 --> 13:29.465
than the wishes that issue
from you, my dear sire.

13:29.466 --> 13:31.200
( crowd chattering )

13:32.536 --> 13:34.704
No greater balm
could I desire,

13:34.705 --> 13:37.640
than your grace
and charm in my home.

13:41.178 --> 13:43.079
I have received
many glowing reports

13:43.080 --> 13:44.414
of your beauty,
princess,

13:44.415 --> 13:46.816
but even the most
glowing of all

13:46.817 --> 13:50.586
failed to do justice
to your radiance.

13:53.991 --> 13:57.226
I take it your journey
was pleasant and safe?

13:59.797 --> 14:02.932
The journey was lovely.

14:10.741 --> 14:13.776
With only one minus:

14:13.777 --> 14:15.912
How long it took to travel

14:15.913 --> 14:17.780
to the palace
of Your Highness.

14:17.781 --> 14:18.848
( scoffs )

14:20.451 --> 14:22.118
(Margrave)
I confess that I'm puzzled.

14:22.119 --> 14:24.253
I heard that in the art
of meter and rhyme,

14:24.254 --> 14:26.622
nobody surpasses
the Princess of Thryce.

14:28.225 --> 14:32.428
( high-pitched )
If I may request
your permission to speak,

14:32.429 --> 14:35.398
O great one, before whom
the mighty are meek.

14:35.399 --> 14:37.233
By all means, duchess.

14:37.234 --> 14:40.503
From the rigors of travel
the princess is weary,

14:40.504 --> 14:44.607
her senses are dulled
and her vision is bleary,

14:44.608 --> 14:48.010
but I can assure you
that when she has rested,

14:48.011 --> 14:49.579
the best you have heard

14:49.580 --> 14:52.648
is quite sure to be bested.

14:52.649 --> 14:54.250
I hope that's the case.

14:55.953 --> 14:58.287
If not, I'll soon be
thanking your niece

14:58.288 --> 15:00.790
for taking the trouble
to travel all this distance,

15:00.791 --> 15:04.193
and wishing her a safe
and speedy journey home.

15:04.194 --> 15:07.130
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

15:17.195 --> 15:20.197
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

15:20.198 --> 15:22.033
There are only
five guards.

15:22.034 --> 15:24.268
If you help me get them all
into the cell, I can take them.

15:24.269 --> 15:26.203
That's impossible.

15:26.204 --> 15:27.638
Women are forbidden
to take up arms.

15:27.639 --> 15:28.873
It's the law.

15:28.874 --> 15:30.808
( door rattles )

15:35.347 --> 15:37.548
Luncheon is served,
Your Highness.

15:37.549 --> 15:39.984
Thank you.
( chuckles )

15:39.985 --> 15:42.253
Why did you thank him?

15:42.254 --> 15:43.955
Why did you
look down like that?

15:43.956 --> 15:46.090
Because I'm no longer
the reigning monarch,

15:46.091 --> 15:48.826
and by the Law of Right and Good
only the reigning monarch

15:48.827 --> 15:51.362
can look into
the countenance of a man.

15:51.363 --> 15:54.165
Arla, does the Law
of Right and Good

15:54.166 --> 15:55.499
command you to die?

15:55.500 --> 15:58.669
The law says that
if a woman disobeys her husband

15:58.670 --> 16:00.871
she will wander forever
in the Underworld,

16:00.872 --> 16:03.207
without family or friends,
utterly alone.

16:03.208 --> 16:05.076
But if she dies
in accord with the law,

16:05.077 --> 16:08.579
she will be reunited
with her loved ones,

16:08.580 --> 16:10.247
in eternal peace.

16:10.248 --> 16:13.918
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

16:13.919 --> 16:16.087
( guards chattering )

16:27.332 --> 16:29.734
Zedd ( in normal voice )
<i>With grace, Cara.</i>

16:29.735 --> 16:31.902
Grace. The gavotte
is a courtly dance,

16:31.903 --> 16:34.405
not a military march.

16:34.406 --> 16:35.706
Turning out, and--

16:35.707 --> 16:37.641
Turning out, not in.

16:37.642 --> 16:39.810
Why am I still in this room?

16:39.811 --> 16:41.078
Because if you go
nosing about

16:41.079 --> 16:42.913
the Margrave's palace
without his permission

16:42.914 --> 16:45.383
you'll be stopped by
the first guard who sees you.

16:45.384 --> 16:48.085
We're to wait until
the Margrave summons us.

16:48.086 --> 16:49.754
( knock on door )

16:49.755 --> 16:51.555
As I was saying.

16:53.458 --> 16:55.159
( high-pitched )
Who is it?

16:55.160 --> 16:58.462
(Herald)
It is I,
the Margrave's Herald.

17:02.034 --> 17:04.068
Forgive my intrusion.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.337
The Margrave has requested
the princess' presence

17:06.338 --> 17:07.805
in the throne room.

17:07.806 --> 17:10.107
Inform the Margrave
we shall come at once.

17:10.108 --> 17:11.642
Of course, duchess.

17:11.643 --> 17:14.612
If you will inform the princess
that she is looking lovely.

17:16.214 --> 17:19.450
Uh, as--
As is her aunt.

17:20.986 --> 17:23.119
Who has brought to the stone
confines of Rothenberg

17:23.121 --> 17:24.954
a welcome breath
of elegance and grace.

17:24.955 --> 17:27.558
In order to comply
with the Margrave's request,

17:27.559 --> 17:30.394
the princess must complete
her toilette.

17:33.465 --> 17:35.666
I think you
have an admirer.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.201
Is there any reason
why I shouldn't?

17:39.404 --> 17:43.107
Your Majesty,
may I ask you a favor?

17:43.108 --> 17:44.608
You have only to name it.

17:44.609 --> 17:45.976
I've always
dreamed of seeing

17:45.977 --> 17:49.113
the wonders of the Palace
of Rothenberg.

17:49.114 --> 17:51.482
Would it be all right
if I did some exploring?

17:51.483 --> 17:54.685
(Herald). Give Prince Roderick
the royal tour.

17:54.686 --> 17:56.754
And see that you stay
close by his side.

17:56.755 --> 17:59.557
We wouldn't want our guest
losing his way.

18:04.329 --> 18:07.531
And this is the very spot
that the Duke of Aspasia

18:07.532 --> 18:10.301
was murdered in cold blood
by his mad nephew Hamling.

18:10.302 --> 18:11.836
Fascinating.

18:11.837 --> 18:15.072
You can see traces of his blood
on the keystone of that arch.

18:15.073 --> 18:18.542
Oh, madam, you've dropped
your handkerchief.

18:20.645 --> 18:23.614
I believe that was
an invitation, sir.

18:25.383 --> 18:27.151
Of course, an invitation.

18:27.152 --> 18:29.587
So the stories are true,
Your Highness?

18:29.588 --> 18:31.689
A thousand conquests
to your name?

18:32.924 --> 18:34.959
Well, who keeps count, really.
( chuckles )

18:34.960 --> 18:37.928
Whatever the numbers may be,
perhaps you're in a position

18:37.929 --> 18:40.731
to offer me some advice?

18:40.732 --> 18:43.968
In, uh, a matter
of the heart.

18:45.470 --> 18:47.138
Would the object
of your affection

18:47.139 --> 18:49.874
happen be my aunt, sir?

18:52.177 --> 18:55.246
I've been alone in this palace
for a long time.

18:55.247 --> 18:58.549
I could put in a word
for you,

18:58.550 --> 19:02.386
if you'll do me
a favor in return.

19:02.387 --> 19:03.954
Anything, sir.

19:03.955 --> 19:05.823
I'm building a dungeon
back in Thryce,

19:05.824 --> 19:07.725
and I've heard
there's nothing equal

19:07.726 --> 19:09.493
to the one
you've got here.

19:09.494 --> 19:12.496
I'd love to have a look at it,
maybe get some ideas.

19:12.497 --> 19:14.798
( sighs )

19:14.799 --> 19:18.102
Alas, that is one favor
I am forbidden to grant.

19:18.103 --> 19:20.671
You see, the entire north wing,
which houses the dungeon,

19:20.672 --> 19:22.306
is off limits to visitors.

19:22.307 --> 19:24.475
Well, unfortunately,
my aunt's petticoats

19:24.476 --> 19:27.645
will be off limits to you, sir.

19:27.646 --> 19:29.313
The stones for the dungeon

19:29.314 --> 19:31.916
were dragged by oxen
from the quarry at Rivington.

19:31.917 --> 19:35.319
These are the famous
Gates of Misery.

19:35.320 --> 19:38.389
Each of the panels weighs
27 imperial tons.

19:38.390 --> 19:41.792
My interest in the dungeon
isn't strictly architectural.

19:43.862 --> 19:46.163
Of all the women whose delights
I have sampled,

19:46.164 --> 19:48.632
the one I've wanted most...

19:50.202 --> 19:52.536
( whispers )
...the Mother Confessor,

19:52.537 --> 19:55.239
has always been
too dangerous to touch.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.509
But now, if the rumors
are true,

19:58.510 --> 20:00.377
she's within my reach,

20:00.378 --> 20:02.179
in a place where
her magic has no power.

20:05.850 --> 20:07.885
If you were to get me
passed those gates,

20:07.886 --> 20:10.254
I would do more than put in
a word for you with my aunt.

20:10.255 --> 20:13.757
I could virtually
assure you of success.

20:15.660 --> 20:16.994
The only key to the dungeon

20:16.995 --> 20:18.696
is in the Margrave's
personal possession.

20:18.697 --> 20:20.464
And at the moment,
nobody is allowed

20:20.465 --> 20:21.765
through the Gates
of Misery.

20:21.766 --> 20:24.268
Not even the jailers
guarding the prisoners

20:24.269 --> 20:27.738
in the cells will be allowed
out of the dungeon until--

20:27.739 --> 20:29.373
Until what?

20:31.443 --> 20:34.211
Forgive me, sir.

20:34.212 --> 20:36.780
I believe it is time
we returned to the throne room.

20:41.553 --> 20:44.922
Your palace is stunning,
O Margrave serene.

20:44.923 --> 20:47.891
The gardens the loveliest
I've ever seen.

20:47.892 --> 20:50.294
The lilies, the roses,
the hyacinths blue,

20:50.295 --> 20:52.596
all gather their beauty

20:52.597 --> 20:54.865
in tribute to you.

20:54.866 --> 20:55.933
( crowd chuckles )

21:04.342 --> 21:06.744
( gasps )

21:06.745 --> 21:09.280
Clean that up at once!

21:09.281 --> 21:11.982
Servants these days
are hopeless, my liege.

21:11.983 --> 21:15.185
One feels in one's house
as if under siege.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.553
(Margrave)
Too true, countess.

21:16.554 --> 21:18.422
In my father's day,
people knew their place.

21:18.423 --> 21:20.190
There was such a thing
as discipline.

21:23.228 --> 21:25.562
When my servants drop things,
or grumble, or whine,

21:25.563 --> 21:27.531
it's never too long before
they're back in line.

21:30.001 --> 21:32.636
Tell me how you manage it,
princess.

21:32.637 --> 21:35.005
Once, long ago,

21:35.006 --> 21:37.574
I was training a slave,

21:37.575 --> 21:39.543
who endeavored
most stubbornly

21:39.544 --> 21:41.845
not to behave.

21:41.846 --> 21:44.315
So I cut off a finger
or two with a knife,

21:44.316 --> 21:47.284
and threatened to slaughter
his child and his wife.

21:47.285 --> 21:49.987
Then I stripped him down naked,
and strapped to a horse,

21:49.988 --> 21:52.189
I dragged him through miles
of bramble and gorse,

21:52.190 --> 21:55.592
poured salt in the wounds
and rolled him in rubble,

21:55.593 --> 21:58.829
and that was the last time
he gave any trouble.

22:00.231 --> 22:01.498
Impressive.

22:02.801 --> 22:04.301
I'll have to give it a try.

22:04.302 --> 22:07.705
( crowd murmuring )

22:07.706 --> 22:10.207
( women chattering )

22:11.910 --> 22:13.744
( whispering )
The dungeon
isn't heavily guarded,

22:13.745 --> 22:15.446
but only the Margrave
has the key.

22:15.447 --> 22:18.315
( whispering )
There may be a way
to get it from him.

22:18.316 --> 22:19.550
Have you noticed the way

22:19.551 --> 22:21.085
the women in the palace
look at you?

22:21.086 --> 22:22.686
Noticed?

22:22.687 --> 22:24.254
I've already had three
handkerchiefs

22:24.255 --> 22:26.357
and a garter belt
slipped into my pockets.

22:26.358 --> 22:28.425
Why?

22:28.426 --> 22:30.828
The Margrave's sister
Millicent may know where

22:30.829 --> 22:32.796
her brother
keeps the key.

22:32.797 --> 22:34.498
If you were to work
your charms on her--

22:34.499 --> 22:37.968
Or should I say
Prince Roderick's charms.

22:37.969 --> 22:40.871
--perhaps you could convince
her to get it for you.

22:40.872 --> 22:42.806
Where is she?

22:42.807 --> 22:43.941
Over there.

22:48.513 --> 22:50.581
No, not that one.

22:50.582 --> 22:51.715
The other one.

22:53.718 --> 22:56.653
( <i>quirky theme playing</i> )

23:00.592 --> 23:02.025
( sighs )

23:19.377 --> 23:21.712
May the Spirits
be with me.

23:27.619 --> 23:28.952
(Drucilla)
Oh, princess,

23:28.953 --> 23:31.221
I'm filled with
much admiration.

23:31.222 --> 23:35.993
You must show the Margrave
your lovely creation.

23:39.297 --> 23:40.631
( crowd murmuring
and chuckling )

23:45.670 --> 23:48.739
My humble attempt
could not ever compare

23:48.740 --> 23:50.774
with something so elegant,

23:50.775 --> 23:54.278
simple and spare,
so filled with the light

23:54.279 --> 23:55.646
of the good and the true.

23:55.647 --> 24:00.050
Alas, what you see
is the best I can do.

24:00.051 --> 24:01.518
( crowd applauds )

24:03.254 --> 24:06.256
Perhaps the princess
has not yet recovered

24:06.257 --> 24:07.758
from the rigors of travel?

24:07.759 --> 24:11.895
When her mother was killed
in a fall from the saddle,

24:11.896 --> 24:15.365
she was raised by her father
on the trail of battle.

24:15.366 --> 24:17.434
While deficient,
perhaps,

24:17.435 --> 24:18.769
in the making of lace,

24:18.770 --> 24:21.905
she has mastered the arts
of the hunt and the chase.

24:21.906 --> 24:24.842
The forests of Rothenberg,
so I am told,

24:24.843 --> 24:28.245
are teaming with Shadrins
ferocious and bold.

24:28.246 --> 24:30.681
Would it be asking
a favor too terribly blunt,

24:30.682 --> 24:34.418
if I begged you to give us
the thrill of a hunt?

24:39.924 --> 24:41.658
(Margrave)
A wife I could hunt with.

24:43.628 --> 24:45.229
Now, that would be
something worth having.

24:47.432 --> 24:49.700
Does the idea of a hunt sound
like fun to you, countess?

24:49.701 --> 24:52.636
That which
amuses the Margrave,

24:52.637 --> 24:54.671
of course, is to me,
of amusement,

24:54.672 --> 24:57.875
the ultimate source.

24:57.876 --> 25:00.177
Then we shall have
a hunt this afternoon.

25:00.178 --> 25:03.680
Herald, see to the arrangements.

25:03.681 --> 25:05.616
( both laughing )

25:05.617 --> 25:06.783
Oh! Ha-ha!

25:09.554 --> 25:11.388
( moaning )

25:11.389 --> 25:13.490
You know what?

25:13.491 --> 25:16.693
Bedchambers are so boring.

25:16.694 --> 25:20.197
Have you ever sampled
the delights of love in chains?

25:20.198 --> 25:22.132
Sounds exciting.

25:22.133 --> 25:23.534
( moans )

25:23.535 --> 25:25.636
( Richard grunts )

25:25.637 --> 25:26.937
( Richard gasps )

25:26.938 --> 25:28.305
( laughs )

25:28.306 --> 25:30.941
Then shall we continue
this in the dungeon?

25:30.942 --> 25:32.209
I wish we could,

25:32.210 --> 25:35.012
but only my brother
has the key.

25:35.013 --> 25:36.013
Oh.

25:36.014 --> 25:37.214
( moans )

25:37.215 --> 25:38.515
Get it from him.

25:38.516 --> 25:39.816
( chuckles )

25:39.817 --> 25:41.084
Women are never allowed

25:41.085 --> 25:42.986
to carry the keys
to anything.

25:42.987 --> 25:44.187
But that's all right.

25:44.188 --> 25:50.661
We'll make our
own chains right here.

25:50.662 --> 25:52.796
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

25:52.797 --> 25:54.431
(Margrave)
Unhand her, knave.

25:54.432 --> 25:56.166
Thank you, countess,
for alerting me

25:56.167 --> 25:58.569
to this violation
of my sister's honor.

25:58.570 --> 25:59.836
Guards.

26:04.642 --> 26:06.977
When you are presentable,
you will stand before me,

26:06.978 --> 26:09.580
and be sentenced
for your crime.

26:09.581 --> 26:12.282
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

26:19.862 --> 26:21.329
(Margrave)
I am sorry to dim

26:21.330 --> 26:24.365
the joyous occasion
of my upcoming betrothal,

26:24.366 --> 26:26.601
but there is no question

26:26.602 --> 26:29.604
that in so flagrant
a display of indecent behavior,

26:29.605 --> 26:32.306
the Law of Right and Good

26:32.307 --> 26:33.875
calls for a sentence of death.

26:33.876 --> 26:35.309
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

26:35.310 --> 26:39.380
Brother, you're always
so mean and unfair.

26:39.381 --> 26:43.618
If you care for my feelings,
his life you will spare.

26:43.619 --> 26:46.454
After you've chosen a bride,
you'll be set.

26:46.455 --> 26:49.323
You'll have a darling
to coddle and pet.

26:49.324 --> 26:51.225
You'll have a plaything

26:51.226 --> 26:53.227
that's yours for all time.

26:53.228 --> 26:57.632
( sobbing )
Why shouldn't I have
a plaything that's mine?

27:02.004 --> 27:03.604
( sobbing )

27:06.108 --> 27:08.643
Out of the great love
I feel for my sister,

27:09.678 --> 27:13.648
I will temper justice
with mercy.

27:13.649 --> 27:16.217
Are you willing to marry
the woman you have defiled?

27:21.156 --> 27:23.291
Not willing, sir.

27:24.593 --> 27:26.427
Eager.

27:26.428 --> 27:28.029
( crowd murmuring )

27:28.030 --> 27:29.030
It is my greatest wish.

27:29.031 --> 27:31.766
Then your wish is granted.

27:33.035 --> 27:35.436
But until you
are properly wed,

27:35.437 --> 27:37.605
my guards shall stay
with you wherever you go,

27:37.606 --> 27:39.273
to make sure you don't
assault the virtue

27:39.274 --> 27:41.709
of any more ladies
of this court.

27:41.710 --> 27:44.645
And now to the hunt.

27:51.219 --> 27:53.821
I'll never get
near the dungeon now.

27:53.822 --> 27:56.724
I'm afraid there's
only one hope left to us.

27:56.725 --> 27:58.659
For Cara to get close
enough to the Margrave

27:58.660 --> 28:00.361
to steal the key.

28:00.362 --> 28:02.596
You must
do exactly as I say.

28:02.597 --> 28:03.798
When in the hunt,

28:03.799 --> 28:05.533
a woman must never
take the lead,

28:05.534 --> 28:08.402
she must never--
Forget the lessons.

28:08.403 --> 28:11.405
I've minced
and curtsied and rhymed,

28:11.406 --> 28:13.641
and we still
don't have the key.

28:13.642 --> 28:15.810
I'll get it my way.

28:15.811 --> 28:18.079
Without your Agiels?

28:18.080 --> 28:21.048
I don't need magic
to make a man beg for mercy.

28:23.552 --> 28:24.952
( sighs )

28:24.953 --> 28:27.054
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

28:34.596 --> 28:37.131
( birds chirping )

28:39.301 --> 28:42.536
My lady, forgive me
for being so forward,

28:42.537 --> 28:44.739
but if your niece
should win,

28:44.740 --> 28:46.173
then Rothenberg will
be your home

28:46.174 --> 28:48.576
as well as mine
for a very long time.

28:48.577 --> 28:51.645
It will be good
not to be alone

28:51.646 --> 28:54.181
in those cold and drafty halls.

28:55.650 --> 28:58.452
( high-pitched )
You're very forward indeed, sir.

28:58.453 --> 29:00.421
I know I am below
your station,

29:00.422 --> 29:03.324
but my influence
with the Margrave is great.

29:03.325 --> 29:05.526
I could do much to advance
the cause of your princess

29:05.527 --> 29:06.660
over that of her rival.

29:08.096 --> 29:11.832
That is, if you should wish
to share my interest in

29:11.833 --> 29:13.234
not being alone.

29:13.235 --> 29:14.468
Hm.

29:14.469 --> 29:16.137
( <i>quirky theme playing</i> )

29:18.607 --> 29:20.808
( Drucilla screaming )

29:20.809 --> 29:21.976
( growling )

29:21.977 --> 29:23.944
Oh, the-- The beast,

29:23.945 --> 29:26.180
I have seen it,
its fury outrageous.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.716
Please kill it and save us,
O Margrave courageous!

29:31.653 --> 29:33.287
( roars )

29:34.790 --> 29:36.123

Mm.

30:06.354 --> 30:07.688
( gasps )

30:09.191 --> 30:11.192
Where I come from,

30:11.193 --> 30:13.060
the raw liver
of a Shadrin is considered

30:13.061 --> 30:14.862
a powerful aphrodisiac.

30:14.863 --> 30:16.864
( gasping )

30:16.865 --> 30:19.433
Would you like some?

30:22.137 --> 30:25.339
Do you know how many
Laws of Right and Good

30:25.340 --> 30:27.308
you have just broken?

30:27.309 --> 30:29.810
It's your choice, Margrave.

30:29.811 --> 30:33.247
An eternity of right and good,

30:33.248 --> 30:35.916
or an eternity of me.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.986
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

30:45.127 --> 30:46.660

Your Majesty, with the hope

30:46.661 --> 30:49.263
that we will soon be
brothers-in-law twice over,

from the far reaches
of the Old World,

Sister Nicci.

30:59.841 --> 31:02.810
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

31:08.483 --> 31:10.451
(Margrave)
Welcome to Rothenberg,
Sister Nicci.

31:10.452 --> 31:11.986
You're just in time
to join our banquet.

31:11.987 --> 31:14.722
I'm not here
for revelry, Margrave.

31:14.723 --> 31:16.991
I'm here to complete
our arrangement.

31:16.992 --> 31:19.927
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

31:26.843 --> 31:29.812
Do you have what I was promised?

31:29.813 --> 31:32.581
Our agreement,
signed in the Keeper's blood.

31:34.584 --> 31:36.618
Do you have
what I was promised?

31:36.619 --> 31:38.487
She awaits in my dungeon.

31:38.488 --> 31:41.890
But before Iend for her,
I need to see if the contract

31:41.891 --> 31:43.458
reflects the terms
we agreed on.

31:45.862 --> 31:46.995
Of course.

31:51.668 --> 31:54.536
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

32:03.179 --> 32:04.580
(Guard)
We've just gotten word

32:04.581 --> 32:06.648
that the Margrave's special
visitor's arrived.

32:06.649 --> 32:08.450
You know what that means,
don't you, ladies?

32:08.451 --> 32:10.219
Almost time to line up
for the block.

32:10.220 --> 32:12.387
( laughing )
Who wants to go first?

32:15.592 --> 32:17.960
We can't wait any longer.

32:17.961 --> 32:20.596
I can't do the thing
you're asking.

32:20.597 --> 32:23.599
Any woman who took up arms
would die instantly,

32:23.600 --> 32:25.000
and be damned
for eternity.

32:25.001 --> 32:26.568
I've taken up arms all my life

32:26.569 --> 32:28.003
and I haven't died.

32:28.004 --> 32:31.640
I was taken from my people
in Nargoth when I was a child,

32:31.641 --> 32:35.344
and raised in Rothenberg
to be the Margrave's wife.

32:35.345 --> 32:37.145
If I die
as the law bids me to,

32:37.146 --> 32:39.548
I'll be reunited
with my mother and father

32:39.549 --> 32:41.850
in the Underworld.

32:41.851 --> 32:46.355
If I die, the Keeper will
destroy all of life.

32:46.356 --> 32:48.257
Do you understand that?

32:48.258 --> 32:50.425
The Law of Right and Good
says that to a woman

32:50.426 --> 32:52.327
understanding
is not given.

32:52.328 --> 32:55.664
And who wrote
this Law of Right and Good?

32:55.665 --> 32:57.733
A man?

32:57.734 --> 32:59.434
No.

32:59.435 --> 33:01.169
The Creator wrote the law.

33:01.170 --> 33:02.671
In her own hand.

33:02.672 --> 33:04.606
And what does the law
say about the Creator?

33:04.607 --> 33:06.475
It is written:

33:06.476 --> 33:07.910
"From the Source of Light

33:07.911 --> 33:09.645
"flows all that is good,

33:09.646 --> 33:10.879
"all that is love,

33:10.880 --> 33:12.648
and all that is peace."

33:14.284 --> 33:17.252
So you believe that the source
of all that is good

33:17.253 --> 33:19.288
would punish someone
for staying alive

33:19.289 --> 33:22.658
so that she could hold
her mother in her arms again?

33:22.659 --> 33:25.227
Do you believe that the Creator

33:25.228 --> 33:28.130
wants all of life
to be destroyed?

33:30.767 --> 33:32.334
I'm frightened.

33:32.335 --> 33:33.702
( sighs )

33:37.774 --> 33:39.541
The Creator will
be with us,

33:39.542 --> 33:42.277
every step of the way.

with this gathering as I am.

to show you

what you're going
to have for eternity

34:07.203 --> 34:09.137
once I'm your bride.

34:10.473 --> 34:13.909
This is an extremely
important matter.

34:13.909 --> 34:17.012
And I'm an extremely
impatient woman.

34:17.013 --> 34:18.612
If you make
me wait a second longer,

34:18.614 --> 34:19.781
I may change my mind.

34:26.255 --> 34:27.522
Meet me in the corridor.

34:29.625 --> 34:32.793
Gracious guests,

34:32.795 --> 34:35.964
I must attend to an
important matter of state.

34:35.965 --> 34:39.234
I beg your leave while I retire
briefly to my chambers.

34:39.235 --> 34:42.137
Very briefly, I hope.

34:42.138 --> 34:43.871
I will do my best.

34:46.775 --> 34:48.610
( guests chattering )

34:50.446 --> 34:52.481
(Cara)
I fear I have overindulged
in the fare,

34:52.482 --> 34:54.683
I seem to be needing
a bit of fresh air.

35:02.358 --> 35:04.893
Send them away.

35:04.894 --> 35:08.930
I don't want anyone else
hearing my moans of ecstasy.

35:08.931 --> 35:10.932
They're all for you.

35:12.168 --> 35:13.301
Leave us.

Give me the key
to the dungeon.

to get the key from you,

35:35.925 --> 35:37.659

35:41.464 --> 35:43.331
(Nicci)
I have waited long enough.

35:43.332 --> 35:45.867
Tell the Margrave that
if he's interested

35:45.868 --> 35:47.536
what I have to offer,
he will return at once.

35:47.537 --> 35:49.037
I would be happy to,
madam.

35:52.842 --> 35:56.411
If I were not under
strict instructions

35:56.412 --> 35:58.413
not to interrupt him
when he is attending

35:58.414 --> 35:59.581
to a matter of state.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.822
Who is this woman,

36:06.823 --> 36:08.790
and why are you taking
directions from her?

36:08.791 --> 36:10.792
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:10.793 --> 36:12.661
( sneezes )

36:12.662 --> 36:16.364
( high-pitched )
These drafty old halls
have given me a nasty cold.

36:16.365 --> 36:18.033
I know you from somewhere.

36:18.034 --> 36:19.801
I can't imagine
where, madam.

36:19.802 --> 36:21.369
Let me see your face.

36:22.638 --> 36:23.939
(Zedd)
Madam?

36:31.881 --> 36:33.782
Maybe you don't remember me

36:33.783 --> 36:36.451
because you're not the only one
whose appearance has changed

36:36.452 --> 36:39.054
since the last time
we saw each other.

36:39.055 --> 36:42.491
But how could I ever forget
the man who killed me?

36:44.393 --> 36:46.027
This is no woman.

36:46.028 --> 36:49.831
This is the Wizard,
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander.

36:49.832 --> 36:51.633
Impossible.

36:53.069 --> 36:54.903
( guests gasp )

36:54.904 --> 36:56.671
The Seeker.

36:56.672 --> 36:58.440
What?
(Nicci) Kill them both.

36:58.441 --> 37:00.342
( guests gasp )

37:00.343 --> 37:01.776
Take me to the dungeon.

37:01.777 --> 37:03.111
There's no need
for a weapon.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.082
I will happily
show you the way.

37:07.083 --> 37:09.384
( all grunting )

37:09.385 --> 37:12.320
( <i>tense action theme playing</i> )

37:18.261 --> 37:20.095
( both scream )

37:26.479 --> 37:29.848
( all grunting )

37:29.849 --> 37:33.052
( <i>action theme playing</i> )

37:39.826 --> 37:41.727
Tell me where the key is,

37:41.728 --> 37:44.496
or there's going
to be a royal decapitation.

37:46.933 --> 37:48.667
It's sewn inside my vest.

37:48.668 --> 37:51.904
( <i>tense theme playing</i> )

37:56.443 --> 37:59.445
Dear Margrave, the sight
of your face makes me sick.

37:59.446 --> 38:03.549
You decadent, pompous,
self-satisfied--

38:03.550 --> 38:05.851
( guards laughing )

38:05.852 --> 38:07.186
(Arla)
Help!

38:07.187 --> 38:10.456
The Mother Confessor,
I think she stopped breathing!

38:10.457 --> 38:13.392
If she dies on my watch,
I'll be the one on the block.

38:13.393 --> 38:15.194
What happened?

38:15.195 --> 38:16.729
She slashed her own throat.

38:16.730 --> 38:19.932
She said she didn't want to give
the Margrave the satisfaction.

38:19.933 --> 38:21.867
Dark Spirits on
the race of Confessors.

38:21.868 --> 38:23.402
( blade slashes )
( groans )

38:23.403 --> 38:27.706
( <i>action theme playing</i> )

38:27.707 --> 38:29.675
( all grunting )

38:47.127 --> 38:49.361
The Mother Confessor's
cell is through that gate.

38:49.362 --> 38:51.697
( <i>action theme playing</i> )

38:58.304 --> 39:01.106
( all grunting )

39:06.980 --> 39:08.247
We have to go.

39:08.248 --> 39:10.249
I can't. The law.

39:10.250 --> 39:12.818
But you fought them.
For you.

39:12.819 --> 39:15.487
But your laws are not my laws.

39:15.488 --> 39:17.623
I can't disobey my husband.

39:17.624 --> 39:19.625
My life is in his hands.

39:19.626 --> 39:21.260
I can't leave you.

39:21.261 --> 39:22.461
You must.

39:22.462 --> 39:24.163
So you can defeat the Keeper.

39:25.965 --> 39:28.834
Your life is in your hands,
Arla.

39:28.835 --> 39:30.803
Only yours.

39:32.605 --> 39:33.806
Duck.

39:33.807 --> 39:35.007
( grunts )

39:35.008 --> 39:37.576
( <i>action theme playing</i> )

( <i>action theme playing</i> )

(Kahlan)
Cara!

40:04.938 --> 40:07.106
( all grunting )

40:07.107 --> 40:10.042
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

40:22.789 --> 40:26.125
It's over, Nicci.
You have no magic here.

40:26.126 --> 40:27.860
You're defenseless.

40:27.861 --> 40:30.362
( panting )

40:31.731 --> 40:34.399
I still have all the magic
I've ever had...

40:35.502 --> 40:37.436
outside this palace.

40:39.706 --> 40:42.775
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

40:51.251 --> 40:52.584
(Arla)
Kahlan.

41:01.261 --> 41:02.361
(Herald)
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

41:02.362 --> 41:04.897
Your Majesty, are you all right?

41:07.367 --> 41:09.668
What happened?
Where is she?

41:09.669 --> 41:12.237
The Royal Party of Thryce

41:12.238 --> 41:14.773
was not the Royal
Party of Thryce.

41:14.774 --> 41:16.642
They deceived us all.

41:16.643 --> 41:18.844
They're gone.

41:21.748 --> 41:23.048
And Sister Nicci?

41:23.049 --> 41:25.784
Gone also, Margrave.

41:27.554 --> 41:29.354
Well, if I'm not going
to live forever,

41:29.355 --> 41:31.323
I'll spend my years
with a beautiful wife.

41:31.324 --> 41:32.991
Summon Countess Drucilla.

41:32.992 --> 41:35.928
And let it be known I've chosen
her to be my bride.

41:35.929 --> 41:38.997
Alas, when she
discovered that eternity

41:38.998 --> 41:41.767
was not part
of the marriage contract,

41:41.768 --> 41:44.269
she departed.

41:45.505 --> 41:47.139
Then bring the queen
from the dungeon.

41:47.140 --> 41:48.807
Tell her
all has been forgiven.

41:48.808 --> 41:50.509
It's better to have
an old reliable mare

41:50.510 --> 41:52.211
than no horse at all,
wouldn't you say?

41:52.212 --> 41:53.579
( chuckles )

41:53.580 --> 41:57.282
Unfortunately,
the queen has escaped.

41:57.283 --> 42:00.252
But don't despair,
Your Majesty.

42:00.253 --> 42:02.187
You will always have me.

42:06.759 --> 42:08.694
( <i>mellow theme playing</i> )

42:13.733 --> 42:14.933
East.

42:14.934 --> 42:16.602
That'll take
us close to Nargoth.

42:16.603 --> 42:17.936
We'll make sure
you get home safe.

42:17.937 --> 42:18.937
Thank you.

42:18.938 --> 42:20.839
Should move fast.

42:20.840 --> 42:22.674
Nicci may have run away,
but she'll be back.

42:22.675 --> 42:24.209
With her powers.

42:24.210 --> 42:25.410
To Nargoth, then.

42:25.411 --> 42:27.479
Uh, not until I get
out of this dress.

42:27.480 --> 42:28.914
Why?

42:28.915 --> 42:30.249
A little lower
on the neckline,

42:30.250 --> 42:32.150
you may never
need another Agiel.

42:34.487 --> 42:36.188
And had you done
this a year ago,

42:36.189 --> 42:38.390
Darken Rah would have
surrendered at the sight of you.

42:38.391 --> 42:39.825
( chuckles )

42:39.826 --> 42:41.593
And if you're going
to wear a hem that short,

42:41.594 --> 42:42.961
you should get rid
of the stockings

42:42.962 --> 42:44.529
and show a little skin.

42:44.530 --> 42:45.731
Ah.
