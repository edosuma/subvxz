02:19.390 --> 02:20.558
Are you a doctor?

02:20.642 --> 02:21.559
Yes. Yes.

02:21.643 --> 02:23.061
He's an actor.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.562
Oh, an actor.

02:24.646 --> 02:26.272
We're very popular
with actors.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.566
Have l, uh,
seen you in anything?

02:28.650 --> 02:31.402
Let's see. I did Hamlet a while back,
didn't l, Liz?

02:31.486 --> 02:34.072
And then we did, the, uh,
The Sand piper.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.740
He's joking.
He was in Luther

02:35.823 --> 02:37.242
and Nobody Loves An Albatross

02:37.325 --> 02:39.577
and a lot of television
plays and commercials.

02:39.661 --> 02:42.080
Well, that's where the money is,
isn't it? Commercials.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.706
And the artistic thrills, too.

02:50.255 --> 02:51.965
7, Diego.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.716
Originally,
the smallest apartment was in 9.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.219
They've been broken up
into four, fives, and sixes.

02:56.302 --> 02:58.221
Now, 7-E is a four,

02:58.304 --> 03:00.306
originally the back
part of a 10.

03:00.390 --> 03:03.142
It has the original dining room
for its living room,

03:03.184 --> 03:05.061
another bedroom
for the bedroom,

03:05.144 --> 03:06.563
and two servants' rooms
thrown together

03:06.646 --> 03:08.815
for a dining room
or a second bedroom.

03:08.898 --> 03:10.358
Do you have children?

03:10.400 --> 03:12.861
Uh, we plan to.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.282
We must oil that gate,
Diego.

03:19.325 --> 03:20.952
This way, please.

03:28.835 --> 03:30.795
The previous tenant,
Mrs. Gardenia,

03:30.837 --> 03:32.922
passed away
just a few days ago,

03:33.006 --> 03:34.549
so nothing
has been moved yet.

03:34.632 --> 03:36.718
Her son asked me to say
that some of the furniture

03:36.801 --> 03:39.095
could be picked up
practically for the asking.

03:39.137 --> 03:40.597
Did she die
in the apartment?

03:40.680 --> 03:41.723
Not that it makes
any difference.

03:41.806 --> 03:44.100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
In a hospital.

03:44.142 --> 03:46.603
She'd been in a coma
for weeks.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.104
After you, please.

03:48.146 --> 03:49.606
Thank you.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.608
She was very old

03:51.649 --> 03:54.110
and passed away
without ever waking.

03:54.152 --> 03:59.115
I'd be grateful to go that way myself
when the time comes.

03:59.157 --> 04:02.368
Oh, no, no, no, not
in the apartment, no.

04:02.744 --> 04:04.662
She was chipper
right to the end,

04:04.996 --> 04:07.290
Been one of the first women
lawyers in New York state.

04:07.332 --> 04:09.042
Did a little gardening on
the side, too.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.002
She was quite a woman.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.504
Oh, closet.

04:12.587 --> 04:14.923
Oh, plenty of closets.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.510
Oh, nice view of the park.

04:18.593 --> 04:21.012
Oh, very nice view.
"I can no longer associate myself"

04:21.095 --> 04:22.305
Now, this room, for instance,

04:22.388 --> 04:23.806
it would make
a lovely nursery.

04:23.890 --> 04:25.517
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper

04:25.600 --> 04:27.519
would brighten it
tremendously.

04:27.602 --> 04:29.521
What are all
these things here?

04:29.604 --> 04:31.022
Herbs, mostly.

04:31.105 --> 04:32.899
A nice large bathroom.

04:32.941 --> 04:34.526
Mmm. Mint, basil.

04:34.609 --> 04:36.694
Yeah. No marijuana?

04:45.119 --> 04:46.579
The, uh, master bedroom.

04:46.621 --> 04:47.622
Oh, yes.

04:47.664 --> 04:50.083
Here we are,
back at the hallway again.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.459
There.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.047
Oh...
Oh, Guy!

04:56.130 --> 04:57.048
Yeah.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.049
Ohh!

04:58.132 --> 04:59.968
The fireplace works,
Of course.

05:00.051 --> 05:00.969
Great.

05:01.052 --> 05:02.470
Oh!

05:02.554 --> 05:05.515
Oh, it's a wonderful apartment.
I love it!

05:05.598 --> 05:06.975
See what she's trying
to do?

05:07.058 --> 05:08.476
She's trying to get you
to lower the rent, see?

05:08.560 --> 05:10.979
Yes. Well, we'd raise it
if we were allowed.

05:11.062 --> 05:13.898
Apartments with
this kind of charm--

05:16.067 --> 05:18.570
Why, that's odd.

05:22.574 --> 05:25.034
There's a closet
behind that secretary.

05:25.118 --> 05:28.037
I'm su--
I'm sure there is.

05:28.121 --> 05:31.040
Yeah. Oh, I think you're right.

05:33.626 --> 05:36.754
She moved it.
It used to be there.

05:42.594 --> 05:45.555
Give me
a hand, will you?

06:06.576 --> 06:09.537
I see now why she
went into a coma!

06:11.915 --> 06:14.918
She couldn't have lifted it by herself.
She was 89!

06:15.043 --> 06:16.503
Should we open it?

06:16.544 --> 06:18.046
Maybe her son should.

06:20.673 --> 06:23.134
I'm authorized
to show the apartment.

06:24.344 --> 06:25.637
Well!

06:25.678 --> 06:27.639
Whatever she locked in
got out.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.141
Well, perhaps she didn't need
five closets.

06:30.183 --> 06:34.145
Why would she cover up
her vacuum cleaner and her towels?

06:34.187 --> 06:36.272
I don't suppose
we'll ever know.

06:36.356 --> 06:38.608
Maybe she was becoming
senile after all.

06:38.691 --> 06:39.776
Is there anything else?

06:39.859 --> 06:42.111
Yes, please.
What about the laundry facilities?

06:42.153 --> 06:43.696
It's bigger
than the other one.

06:43.780 --> 06:46.908
Yeah. It's more expensive, too,
you know?

06:46.950 --> 06:48.409
It's better located.

06:48.451 --> 06:49.911
Yeah, well, God knows,

06:49.953 --> 06:52.080
I could walk to all
the theaters from here.

06:52.121 --> 06:54.207
Oh, Guy, let's take it,
please?

06:54.207 --> 06:55.625
That living room
could be--

06:55.667 --> 06:56.835
Oh, please,
let's take it.

06:56.918 --> 06:59.754
O.K., darling,
we get out of the other lease, O.K.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.756
I was tempted
to write the management

07:01.840 --> 07:04.092
that you were drug addicts
and litterbugs.

07:04.175 --> 07:05.593
Instead, I decided to lie

07:05.677 --> 07:07.595
and tell them you
were wonderful tenants.

07:07.679 --> 07:09.097
Oh, you're great, Hutch.

07:09.180 --> 07:11.099
Wish I could talk
you out of it, though.

07:11.182 --> 07:12.600
He's pulling
your leg, Ro, honey.

07:12.684 --> 07:14.102
Indeed I'm not.

07:14.561 --> 07:15.979
Now, that looks great.
That is--

07:16.062 --> 07:17.981
Are you aware
that the Bramford

07:18.064 --> 07:21.651
had rather an unpleasant reputation
around the turn of the century?

07:21.734 --> 07:23.653
It's where
the Trench sisters

07:23.736 --> 07:25.655
conducted their little
dietary experiments,

07:26.406 --> 07:28.491
and Keith Kennedy
held his parties.

07:28.575 --> 07:31.452
Adrian Marcato lived there, too.
So did Pearl Ames.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.538
- Who was Adrian Marcato?
- Who were the Trench sisters?

07:33.621 --> 07:36.708
The Trench sisters were two proper
Victorian ladies.

07:36.791 --> 07:39.711
They cooked and ate several
young children, including a niece.

07:39.794 --> 07:40.712
Oh, lovely.

07:40.795 --> 07:43.131
Adrian Marcato
practiced witchcraft.

07:43.756 --> 07:45.800
He made quite a splash
in the nineties

07:45.842 --> 07:48.761
by announcing that he'd
conjured up the living devil.

07:48.845 --> 07:50.263
Apparently,
people believed him,

07:50.346 --> 07:52.515
so they attacked
and nearly killed him

07:52.599 --> 07:54.184
in the lobby
of the Bramford.

07:54.225 --> 07:55.226
You're joking?

07:55.268 --> 07:57.437
Later, the Keith Kennedy
business began,

07:57.520 --> 07:59.689
and by the twenties,
the house was half empty.

07:59.772 --> 08:01.399
I knew about
Keith Kennedy.

08:01.441 --> 08:02.942
I didn't know that Marcato
lived there.

08:02.984 --> 08:04.360
And those sisters.

08:04.444 --> 08:06.571
World War Il filled
the house up again.

08:06.654 --> 08:07.572
Terrific.

08:07.655 --> 08:08.823
What? The house?

08:08.907 --> 08:09.824
The lamb.

08:09.908 --> 08:10.825
Oh.

08:10.909 --> 08:12.619
They called it
Black Bramford.

08:13.286 --> 08:16.706
But, Hutch, awful things happen
in every apartment house.

08:16.789 --> 08:20.126
Ah, but this house has a high incidence
of unpleasant happenings.

08:20.168 --> 08:23.588
In '59, a dead infant was found,

08:23.671 --> 08:26.132
wrapped in newspaper
in the basement.

08:26.216 --> 08:28.968
Mmm! You really
rouse my appetite.

08:29.052 --> 08:31.054
Have some more wine.

09:07.674 --> 09:09.092
Roman!

09:09.175 --> 09:12.595
Bring me in some root beer
when you come!

09:46.629 --> 09:49.465
Hey, these are shelves.

10:03.146 --> 10:04.898
Hey...

10:04.981 --> 10:06.482
Iet's make love.

11:31.150 --> 11:32.110
Shh!

11:33.319 --> 11:36.614
I think I hear
the Trench sisters chewing.

11:36.698 --> 11:38.116
Oh!

11:50.211 --> 11:51.796
Straight up
to the left.

11:53.131 --> 11:54.257
Here in Daytona, Florida,

11:54.299 --> 11:56.593
it's the 250-CC
100-Mile Classic

11:56.634 --> 11:59.053
with Yamaha leading
the pack on the final lap...

11:59.137 --> 12:02.682
and winning it, as Yamaha takes 7
of the top 10 places.

12:02.765 --> 12:06.519
It's the third straight year for Yamaha,
a clean sweep.

12:06.603 --> 12:08.646
Yamaha is race bred
from champions,

12:08.730 --> 12:09.939
and, as you can see,

12:10.023 --> 12:11.858
we have a model for
every kind of riding.

12:11.941 --> 12:15.195
You know,you really should
Discover the swingin' world of Yamaha.

12:15.278 --> 12:16.529
Why don't you get on,
have a ride?

12:16.613 --> 12:17.780
Come on. Get on.

12:17.864 --> 12:19.824
O.K., come on.
Let'sgo.

12:25.455 --> 12:26.414
Look.

12:32.879 --> 12:34.005
It's great.

12:49.729 --> 12:54.150
I'm sorry. I thought
you were Victoria Vetri, the actress.

12:54.234 --> 12:55.151
I'm sorry.

12:56.110 --> 12:56.945
That's all right.

12:57.028 --> 12:58.738
A lot of people
think I'm Victoria.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.240
I don't see
any resemblance.

13:00.323 --> 13:01.741
Do you know her?

13:01.824 --> 13:02.742
No.

13:04.994 --> 13:06.412
My name's
Terry Gionoffrio.

13:06.496 --> 13:09.415
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

13:09.499 --> 13:11.751
Uh, we--we're
new tenants here.

13:11.835 --> 13:13.753
I'm staying with the Castavets,
seventh floor.

13:13.837 --> 13:16.256
I'm their guest, sort of,
Since June.

13:16.339 --> 13:18.466
Our apartment used to be
the back part of yours.

13:18.550 --> 13:19.592
Oh, for goodness sakes.

13:19.676 --> 13:21.386
You took the old lady's apartment.
Mrs., uh...

13:21.469 --> 13:23.221
Yeah, um, Miss, uh...
Gard--Gardenia.

13:23.304 --> 13:24.264
Gardenia. Yeah.

13:24.347 --> 13:26.057
She was a good friend
of the Castavets.

13:26.140 --> 13:28.643
She used to grow all kinds of herbs
and things for her to cook with.

13:28.726 --> 13:29.686
I saw those plants.

13:30.311 --> 13:31.604
Yeah. Well, now,
she grows her own things.

13:32.272 --> 13:35.191
Excuse me a moment.
I have to put the softener in.

13:35.275 --> 13:36.359
What does
your husband do?

13:36.442 --> 13:37.360
He's an actor.

13:38.236 --> 13:39.654
No kidding?
What's his name?

13:39.737 --> 13:41.322
Guy Woodhouse.

13:41.406 --> 13:44.325
He was in Luther
and Nobody Loves an Albatross,

13:44.409 --> 13:46.995
and he does a lot
of television and radio.

13:47.078 --> 13:49.330
Gee, I watch TV
all day long.

13:49.414 --> 13:50.999
I bet I've seen him.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.001
Wow!

13:53.084 --> 13:54.335
Ooh!

13:54.419 --> 13:55.837
I hate this basement.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.338
Yeah, me, too.

13:57.422 --> 13:59.174
It gives me the creeps.

13:59.215 --> 14:01.009
Listen, why don't we come down here
regular together

14:01.050 --> 14:02.302
and do our laundry?

14:02.343 --> 14:03.803
O.K., that would be great.

14:03.887 --> 14:05.138
I have a good luck charm.

14:05.346 --> 14:08.266
It might work
for both of us.

14:08.349 --> 14:09.767
Oh, that's beautiful.

14:09.809 --> 14:10.768
Isn't it?

14:11.811 --> 14:13.104
Mrs. Castavet
gave it to me.

14:13.188 --> 14:14.230
It's good luck.

14:14.314 --> 14:15.773
Anyway, it's supposed to be.

14:15.815 --> 14:17.775
It's got some
stuff inside.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.115
I'm not mad about
the smell either.

14:24.324 --> 14:25.450
I hope it works.

14:25.533 --> 14:26.784
It's a beautiful charm, though.

14:26.868 --> 14:28.786
I've never seen
anything like it.

14:28.870 --> 14:30.163
European.

14:30.205 --> 14:32.373
The Castavets are the most wonderful
people in the world,

14:32.457 --> 14:33.291
bar none.

14:33.374 --> 14:35.168
You know, they picked me up
Off the sidewalk, literally?

14:35.210 --> 14:36.169
You were sick?

14:37.795 --> 14:39.088
I was starving and on dope

14:39.130 --> 14:40.423
and doing a lot
of other things.

14:40.507 --> 14:41.925
They're childless, though.

14:41.966 --> 14:43.426
I'm like the daughter
they never had.

14:43.510 --> 14:45.595
At first, I thought they
wanted me for some kind of sex thing,

14:45.678 --> 14:48.097
but they've turned out to be
like real grandparents.

14:48.848 --> 14:51.017
It's nice to know
there are people like that

14:51.100 --> 14:53.394
when you hear
so much about apathy

14:53.478 --> 14:55.438
and people who are afraid
of getting involved.

14:56.439 --> 14:57.899
I'd be dead now
if it wasn't for them.

14:57.982 --> 15:00.652
That's an absolute fact,
dead or in jail.

15:00.735 --> 15:03.863
You don't have any family
that could have helped you?

15:03.947 --> 15:05.031
A brother in the Navy.

15:05.114 --> 15:08.368
Why, it's impossible
to be 100% sure!

15:08.451 --> 15:10.161
If you want my opinion,

15:10.912 --> 15:12.413
we shouldn't tell her at all!

15:12.497 --> 15:13.498
That's my opinion!

15:13.581 --> 15:15.583
That must be
the partition.

15:15.708 --> 15:19.754
That's the back part
of the original 10 with a dining room,

15:19.838 --> 15:22.048
and there's--
there's a closet over here,

15:22.173 --> 15:24.551
and then there's
a closet over here.

16:02.714 --> 16:04.257
Stay back, huh, lady?

16:12.348 --> 16:13.808
Get back now,
will you, please?

16:14.017 --> 16:15.768
Get back.
There's nothing to see.

16:16.644 --> 16:18.563
Get back,
will you, please?

16:19.898 --> 16:21.858
Jesus.

16:21.941 --> 16:23.026
Get back!

16:23.109 --> 16:24.527
We know her.

16:24.611 --> 16:26.029
What's her name?

16:26.112 --> 16:27.363
Terry.

16:27.447 --> 16:28.448
Terry what?

16:29.574 --> 16:30.491
Ro?

16:30.575 --> 16:33.495
What was her name again?
Terry what?

16:34.037 --> 16:35.830
I don't remember.
An ltalian name.

16:35.914 --> 16:38.333
She was staying with some people
named Castavet,

16:38.416 --> 16:39.334
7-E.

16:39.417 --> 16:41.211
Yeah. We got that already.

16:41.961 --> 16:43.046
Short and sweet.

16:43.129 --> 16:46.007
She stuck it to the window sill
with a band-aid.

16:46.090 --> 16:46.883
Come on. Get back.

16:46.966 --> 16:48.384
Theresa Gionoffrio.

16:48.468 --> 16:49.552
Move on!

16:49.636 --> 16:50.678
Move on!

16:52.472 --> 16:53.890
You knew her?

16:53.973 --> 16:54.891
Only slightly.

16:54.974 --> 16:56.893
Come on, Ro baby.
Let's go.

16:56.976 --> 16:58.520
Oh! Here they come.

17:01.689 --> 17:04.067
You folks the Castavets
on the seventh floor?

17:04.150 --> 17:05.068
We are.

17:05.151 --> 17:08.445
You have a young woman named
Theresa Gionoffrio living with you?

17:08.530 --> 17:10.615
We do. What's wrong?
Has there been an accident?

17:10.698 --> 17:13.117
You'd better brace yourself
for some bad news.

17:13.201 --> 17:14.117
She's dead.

17:15.328 --> 17:16.871
Jumped out
of the window.

17:16.954 --> 17:19.374
That's not possible!
It's a mistake!

17:19.457 --> 17:24.212
Artie, you want to let these folks
take a look, please?

17:25.128 --> 17:27.089
I knew this would happen.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.176
She got deeply depressed
every three weeks or so.

17:30.218 --> 17:33.137
I told my wife about it,
but she pooh-poohed me.

17:34.097 --> 17:37.058
Well, that--that doesn't
mean she killed herself.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.685
She was a very happy girl

17:38.726 --> 17:40.687
with no reason
for self-destruction.

17:40.728 --> 17:43.231
She must have been cleaning
the windows or something.

17:43.314 --> 17:45.191
She wasn't cleaning
windows at midnight.

17:45.275 --> 17:46.693
Why not? Maybe she was!

17:46.734 --> 17:48.194
Is that her handwriting?

17:50.738 --> 17:51.698
Yeah.

17:51.739 --> 17:52.949
Definitely.
Absolutely.

17:53.491 --> 17:54.242
Thank you.

17:54.325 --> 17:56.703
I'll see this gets back
to you when we're done with it.

17:57.036 --> 17:59.122
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

17:59.205 --> 18:00.623
She was so happy.

18:00.623 --> 18:02.542
Who's the next-of-kin?

18:02.625 --> 18:04.252
She's all alone.
She didn't have anybody,

18:04.294 --> 18:05.253
only us.

18:05.295 --> 18:06.754
Didn't she
have a brother?

18:06.796 --> 18:07.755
Did she?

18:07.797 --> 18:10.258
She said she did.
In the Navy.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.759
News to me.

18:11.843 --> 18:13.761
Do you know where he's stationed?

18:13.845 --> 18:14.929
No, I don't.

18:15.513 --> 18:18.141
She mentioned him to me
in the laundry room.

18:18.349 --> 18:19.601
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

18:19.684 --> 18:22.103
Uh, we're in,
uh, 7-E.

18:22.187 --> 18:24.606
I feel just the way you do,
Mrs. Castavet.

18:24.689 --> 18:27.108
She seemed so happy
and full of--

18:27.192 --> 18:30.111
She said wonderful things about you
and your husband,

18:30.195 --> 18:31.112
how grateful she was.

18:31.696 --> 18:32.697
Thank you.

18:32.780 --> 18:34.616
You know anything else
about this brother

18:34.699 --> 18:35.700
except he's
in the Navy?

18:35.783 --> 18:36.743
No, I don't.

18:36.784 --> 18:38.620
It should be easy
to find him.

18:40.413 --> 18:42.415
I'm so stunned.
I'm so sorry.

18:42.457 --> 18:43.374
It's such a pity.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.376
Well, thank you.

19:24.415 --> 19:29.796
Sometimes I wonder how come
you're the leader of anything.

19:35.426 --> 19:38.888
Please don't tell me
what Laura-Louise said

19:38.930 --> 19:40.390
because I'm not interested.

19:40.431 --> 19:42.684
If you'd listened to me,

19:42.767 --> 19:44.060
we wouldn't have
had to do this!

19:44.102 --> 19:45.687
We'd have been
all set to go now

19:45.770 --> 19:48.523
instead of having to start
all over from scratch!

19:48.606 --> 19:50.692
I told you not to
tell her in advance!

19:50.775 --> 19:53.736
I told you she wouldn't
be open-minded!

19:55.822 --> 19:58.783
I told Sister Veronica
about the windows,

19:58.825 --> 20:00.535
and she withdrew the school
from the competition.

20:00.660 --> 20:01.744
Otherwise, we would--

20:09.711 --> 20:11.129
Hello. How are you?

20:11.212 --> 20:12.714
Fine. May I come in a minute?

20:12.755 --> 20:14.174
Yes, of course. Please do.

20:14.257 --> 20:15.675
I just come over
to thank you

20:15.758 --> 20:17.177
for saying those nice things to us
the other night.

20:17.260 --> 20:18.678
Oh, no, please.
There's--

20:18.761 --> 20:20.847
Poor Terry. We thought
maybe we'd failed her some way,

20:20.930 --> 20:23.600
although her note made it crystal clear
we hadn't.

20:23.725 --> 20:25.476
You'll never know
how helpful it was

20:25.560 --> 20:27.103
in such a shock moment.

20:27.187 --> 20:29.314
So I do thank you.
Roman does, too.

20:29.397 --> 20:30.356
Roman's my hubby.

20:30.398 --> 20:32.692
You're welcome.
I'm glad I could help.

20:32.775 --> 20:36.321
Yeah. Well, she was cremated yesterday.

20:36.404 --> 20:38.573
Now we got to forget and go on.
It won't be easy.

20:38.615 --> 20:40.492
We don't have any children of our own.
You have any?

20:40.575 --> 20:41.493
No, we don't.

20:41.576 --> 20:42.994
Oh, well,
there you have it.

20:43.077 --> 20:46.831
Ohh! Oh...
that's a nice--

20:46.956 --> 20:49.542
Look how you put the table!
Now, isn't that interesting?

20:49.626 --> 20:50.793
I saw it in a magazine.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.213
Oh, my. Nice paintjob.

20:53.463 --> 20:54.380
I know.

20:54.464 --> 20:56.216
Ahh...well.

20:56.299 --> 20:58.885
That's nice. What is that?
That's the TV room?

20:58.968 --> 21:00.178
Yeah, well,
only temporarily.

21:00.220 --> 21:02.013
It's going
to be a nursery.

21:02.055 --> 21:03.181
Oh, you're pregnant?

21:03.223 --> 21:04.349
No, not yet.

21:04.390 --> 21:06.309
I hope to be as soon
as we're settled.

21:06.392 --> 21:07.894
Wonderful.
Well, you're young and healthy.

21:07.936 --> 21:09.187
You ought to have
lots ofchildren.

21:09.229 --> 21:10.688
We plan to have three.

21:10.730 --> 21:12.482
I'm dying to see what you did
to this apartment.

21:12.565 --> 21:14.692
The woman who had it before
was a dear friend of mine.

21:14.734 --> 21:16.194
I know.
Terry told me.

21:16.236 --> 21:17.529
Well, did she?

21:17.612 --> 21:20.031
You two had some long talks together
in the laundry room.

21:20.073 --> 21:21.074
Only one.

21:21.115 --> 21:22.575
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

21:22.617 --> 21:25.078
Ah ha ha!
It looks so much brighter.

21:26.454 --> 21:29.207
What do you pay
for a chair like that?

21:29.749 --> 21:33.002
Um, I'm not sure, really.
I think about $200.

21:34.254 --> 21:36.214
What does your hubby do?

21:36.256 --> 21:37.715
He's an actor.

21:37.757 --> 21:41.219
I knew it!
I said it to Roman yesterday.

21:41.261 --> 21:43.012
He's so good-looking.

21:43.054 --> 21:45.014
What movies was he in?

21:45.056 --> 21:45.932
No movies.

21:46.057 --> 21:47.725
He was in two plays
called Luther

21:47.767 --> 21:49.310
and Nobody Loves an Albatross

21:49.394 --> 21:51.229
and a lot of television
and radio.

21:51.271 --> 21:52.230
Listen, Rosemary...

21:53.022 --> 21:54.774
I got a 2-inch thick
sirloin steak

21:54.816 --> 21:56.693
sitting defrosting
right this minute.

21:56.776 --> 21:59.070
Why don't you and Guy come over,
have supper with us tonight?

21:59.112 --> 21:59.988
What do you say?

22:00.071 --> 22:01.489
Oh, no. We couldn't.

22:01.573 --> 22:02.657
Why not?

22:02.740 --> 22:04.742
No, really, that's very kind of you.
Listen--

22:04.826 --> 22:07.662
It would be a real help to us.
Oh...

22:07.745 --> 22:09.664
first night we'll be alone since...

22:11.082 --> 22:13.251
Oh, are you sure it wouldn't be
too much trouble for you?

22:13.293 --> 22:15.628
Oh, honey, if it was trouble,
I wouldn't ask you.

22:15.712 --> 22:17.380
All right.
You go ahead and count on us.

22:17.463 --> 22:18.715
I'll have to check with Guy,
though.

22:18.798 --> 22:22.302
Listen, you tell him
I won't take no for an answer!

22:22.385 --> 22:23.845
Oh! Here's your mail!

22:23.887 --> 22:24.846
Oh! Ads!

22:24.888 --> 22:25.847
Thank you.

22:35.982 --> 22:37.066
Yoo-hoo!

22:38.151 --> 22:39.986
Hey.

22:40.028 --> 22:41.654
Mmm!

22:53.833 --> 22:56.336
Donald Baumgart
got that part.

23:08.765 --> 23:10.433
It's a bad play anyway.

23:10.517 --> 23:11.935
Yeah. Even if it folds out of town,

23:11.976 --> 23:14.312
it's the kind of part
that gets noticed.

23:20.527 --> 23:21.945
Mrs. Castavet was here

23:23.446 --> 23:25.949
to thank me for what
I said about Terry.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.285
She is the nosiest
person I've ever seen.

23:29.327 --> 23:32.205
You know she actually
asked the prices of things?

23:32.288 --> 23:33.456
No kidding.

23:34.749 --> 23:37.794
She invited us to have dinner
with them tonight.

23:37.877 --> 23:39.546
I told her I'd have
to check with you,

23:39.587 --> 23:41.422
but that it would
probably be O.K.

23:41.506 --> 23:44.509
Oh, Jesus! We don't have to do that,
do we, honey?

23:44.592 --> 23:45.677
I think they're lonely.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.263
We get friendly with
an old couple like that,

23:48.346 --> 23:49.222
and we'll never
get rid of them.

23:49.305 --> 23:50.932
They're right
across the wall.

23:51.015 --> 23:53.560
I told her she
could count on us.

23:56.813 --> 23:58.273
You don't have
to sulk about it.

23:58.356 --> 23:59.649
I'm not sulking.

23:59.732 --> 24:01.818
I see exactly
what you mean.

24:01.901 --> 24:02.819
Hell, we'll go.

24:02.902 --> 24:04.320
No, no. What for?

24:04.404 --> 24:05.488
We'll go!

24:05.572 --> 24:08.741
No. We don't have to
if you don't want to.

24:08.825 --> 24:11.995
That sounds so phony,
but I really mean it, really, I do.

24:13.246 --> 24:15.123
Be my good deed
for the day.

24:17.041 --> 24:19.252
O.K., but only if you want to.

24:19.335 --> 24:21.713
We'll make it clear that it's just
for this one night

24:21.796 --> 24:23.923
and not the beginning
of anything, all right?

24:24.007 --> 24:26.426
Oh! Perfect timing!
Come on in.

24:26.509 --> 24:28.928
Roman's fixing us
some vodka blushes.

24:29.512 --> 24:31.639
My, I'm glad you could come, Guy.

24:31.639 --> 24:34.142
I'm fixing to tell everybody
that I knew you when.

24:34.225 --> 24:35.894
Look, dinner isn't ready
just yet,

24:35.977 --> 24:37.395
but sit down there
anywhere.

24:37.478 --> 24:38.563
Take a seat
on the couch.

24:38.646 --> 24:40.106
You'll find yourself
very comfortable.

24:40.190 --> 24:42.442
I seem to have
overfilled the glasses.

24:42.525 --> 24:44.444
No, no, no.
Don't get up.

24:44.527 --> 24:48.072
Generally, I pour these out precisely
as a bartender, don't l, Minnie?

24:48.156 --> 24:49.115
Just watch
the carpet.

24:49.199 --> 24:50.950
But this evening I made
a little too much,

24:51.034 --> 24:53.453
and rather I'm afr--
Oh, there we are.

24:53.536 --> 24:54.621
No, no, no.
Sit down, please.

24:54.704 --> 24:55.955
Now, Mrs. Woodhouse...

24:57.040 --> 24:59.375
Uh, Mr. Woodhouse,
uh, vodka blush?

24:59.459 --> 25:00.376
Yes, thanks.

25:00.460 --> 25:01.878
Have you ever
tasted one?

25:01.961 --> 25:03.379
No, no.
I haven't.

25:03.421 --> 25:04.422
It looks delicious.

25:04.506 --> 25:06.883
Minnie. They're very
popular in Australia.

25:06.966 --> 25:09.552
Now, to our guests--
welcome to our home.

25:09.636 --> 25:10.553
Hear, hear.

25:10.637 --> 25:11.554
Cheers.

25:11.638 --> 25:12.680
Mmm.

25:15.683 --> 25:17.393
The carpet.

25:17.477 --> 25:18.811
Oh, dear.

25:18.895 --> 25:20.396
Brand-new carpet.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.733
This man
is so clumsy!

25:23.816 --> 25:25.902
Do you come
from Australia?

25:25.985 --> 25:29.405
Oh, no, no. I'm from
right here in New York city.

25:29.489 --> 25:30.907
I've been there, though.

25:30.990 --> 25:32.408
I've been everywhere,
literally.

25:32.492 --> 25:35.411
You name a place,
and I've been there.

25:35.495 --> 25:36.913
Go ahead. Name a place.

25:36.996 --> 25:38.414
Fairbanks, Alaska!

25:38.498 --> 25:40.917
I've been there,
been all over Alaska--

25:41.000 --> 25:45.296
Yes--Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,
Nome, Sitka, Seward.

25:45.380 --> 25:47.090
I spent four months
there in '38--

25:47.173 --> 25:48.258
Where are
you folks from?

25:48.341 --> 25:49.759
Well--Well, l--

25:49.843 --> 25:52.262
I'm from Omaha.
Guy's from Baltimore.

25:52.345 --> 25:54.430
Omaha's a good city.
Baltimore is, too.

25:54.514 --> 25:56.850
Do you travel
for business?

25:56.933 --> 25:58.768
Well, business
and pleasure both.

25:58.852 --> 26:01.896
I'm 79, and I've been going one place
or another since I was 10.

26:01.938 --> 26:04.065
You name a place,
I've been there.

26:04.148 --> 26:05.233
Ah! Steak's ready.

26:05.275 --> 26:07.235
Don't rush your drinks, now.

26:08.027 --> 26:09.988
Roman, take your pill!

26:10.029 --> 26:14.075
No Pope ever visits a city where
the newspapers are on strike.

26:14.159 --> 26:16.911
I heard he's going to postpone
and wait till it's over.

26:16.995 --> 26:18.913
Well, that's show biz.

26:20.540 --> 26:22.458
That's exactly what it is.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.419
All the costumes
are rituals,

26:24.460 --> 26:25.587
all religions.

26:25.670 --> 26:27.964
Oh, I think we're offending Rosemary.

26:28.047 --> 26:28.756
No, no.

26:28.798 --> 26:30.925
No, you're not religious,
my dear, are you?

26:31.009 --> 26:32.969
Well, l--I was brought up a Catholic.

26:33.011 --> 26:34.470
Now I don't know.

26:34.512 --> 26:35.972
You looked
uncomfortable.

26:36.014 --> 26:37.473
Well, he is the Pope.

26:37.515 --> 26:39.976
Now, you don't need
to have respect for him

26:40.018 --> 26:41.936
because he pretends
that he's holy.

26:42.020 --> 26:43.188
Now, that's a good point.

26:43.271 --> 26:46.691
When I think what they spend
on robes and jewels!

26:46.774 --> 26:50.695
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organized religion

26:50.778 --> 26:52.238
was given, I thought,
in Luther.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.033
Did you ever get to play
that leading part, Guy?

26:55.116 --> 26:56.242
Me? No.

26:56.284 --> 26:58.495
Weren't you Albert Finney's
understudy?

26:58.828 --> 26:59.871
No.

26:59.954 --> 27:01.122
Well, that's strange.

27:01.206 --> 27:03.291
I remember being struck
by a gesture you made

27:03.374 --> 27:04.792
and checking in the program

27:04.876 --> 27:06.294
to see who you were.

27:06.628 --> 27:08.046
Um, what gesture
was that?

27:08.630 --> 27:11.883
Well, I'm not sure now.
It was a reaction--

27:12.050 --> 27:15.303
Oh, I did a thing with my arms
when Luther was having a fit.

27:15.386 --> 27:17.347
It was a kind of
involuntary reach.

27:17.388 --> 27:21.643
That's it! That's it.
It had a wonderful authenticity to it.

27:22.268 --> 27:24.562
Oh, come on.
-No, no. I mean it!

27:24.646 --> 27:27.065
My father was
a theatrical producer,

27:27.482 --> 27:29.859
and my early years
were spent in the company

27:29.943 --> 27:32.904
of Mrs. Fiske, Forbes-Robertson,
Modjeska.

27:32.946 --> 27:34.072
Guy?

27:34.113 --> 27:35.573
Oh, yes, please.

27:35.615 --> 27:38.743
You have a most interesting
inner quality, Guy.

27:38.827 --> 27:41.162
It appears in your
television work, too.

27:41.246 --> 27:43.081
It should take you
a long way, indeed,

27:43.164 --> 27:46.376
provided, of course,
that you get those initial breaks.

27:47.085 --> 27:49.504
Are you preparing
for a show now?

27:49.587 --> 27:52.507
Um, well,
I'm up for a couple parts.

27:52.590 --> 27:55.009
Well, I can't believe
that you won't get them.

27:55.093 --> 27:56.427
Well, I can.

27:56.469 --> 27:59.430
I'd like to have
a spice garden someday.

27:59.472 --> 28:01.850
I guess I'm a country girl
at heart.

28:01.933 --> 28:04.102
You come from a big family?

28:04.477 --> 28:05.895
Three brothers
and two sisters.

28:05.979 --> 28:07.397
Your sisters married?

28:08.273 --> 28:09.691
They have children?

28:09.774 --> 28:11.693
One has two,
the other has four.

28:11.776 --> 28:14.195
There's a chance you'll have
lots of children, too.

28:14.279 --> 28:15.697
We're fertile, all right.

28:16.573 --> 28:18.992
I've got 16
nieces and nephews.

28:19.075 --> 28:20.577
Oh, my goodness!

28:25.206 --> 28:28.293
Would you like me to wash
and you can wipe for a while?

28:28.418 --> 28:29.878
Oh, no.
That's fine, dear.

28:38.303 --> 28:41.264
Now, Roman, will you stop
bending Guy's ears

28:41.306 --> 28:42.765
with your Modjeska stories?

28:42.807 --> 28:45.268
He's only listening
'cause he's polite.

28:45.310 --> 28:47.270
No, no, no, no.
It's very interesting, Mrs. Castavet.

28:47.353 --> 28:49.981
Minnie!
I'm Minnie, he's Roman, O.K.?

28:50.023 --> 28:51.399
O.K.?

28:51.482 --> 28:52.567
O.K.

28:52.650 --> 28:53.735
O.K.!

28:53.818 --> 28:55.236
Terrific.
Just terrific.

28:55.069 --> 28:56.196
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye.

28:56.279 --> 28:57.363
Thank you
for having us.

28:57.447 --> 28:59.157
Yeah, it was lovely.
Oh, bless you.

28:59.240 --> 29:00.325
Minnie!

29:00.408 --> 29:01.868
Minnie, ya good kid, ya.

29:01.910 --> 29:04.662
Ooh!
About that steak, huh?

29:04.746 --> 29:06.664
Oh, my God!
And the cake.

29:06.748 --> 29:09.375
How did you eat two pieces?
It was weird.

29:09.417 --> 29:11.002
Out of politeness.
That's how I ate two pieces.

29:11.085 --> 29:12.253
Out of politeness.

29:13.838 --> 29:16.257
Only three dinner plates
that matched.

29:16.341 --> 29:17.926
Shh!

29:18.009 --> 29:20.678
And all that beautiful,
beautiful silver.

29:20.929 --> 29:22.597
We'll be nice.
Maybe they'll will it to us.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.682
Oh!
Yeah.

29:25.016 --> 29:26.518
Guess what they have
in their bathroom.

29:26.601 --> 29:27.685
A bidet.

29:27.769 --> 29:29.187
Jokes for the John.

29:29.270 --> 29:30.355
No.

29:30.438 --> 29:32.357
A book on a hook
right next to the toilet.

29:33.691 --> 29:35.610
Roman's stories are pretty damned
interesting, though.

29:35.693 --> 29:36.736
Yeah?

29:37.695 --> 29:39.614
Never even heard
of Forbes-Robertson before.

29:39.697 --> 29:41.616
I'm going to go over there
again tomorrow night

29:41.699 --> 29:43.117
and hear some more.

29:43.201 --> 29:44.202
You are?

29:44.285 --> 29:45.286
Yeah. He asked me.

29:45.370 --> 29:47.038
Here. Do this damn thing for me,
will you?

29:47.080 --> 29:49.207
I thought we were going to do something
With Joan and Dick Jellico.

29:49.290 --> 29:51.626
- Was that definite?
- Well, it wasn't definite.

29:51.709 --> 29:53.878
We'll see them next week.

29:54.629 --> 29:57.131
You don't have to come along
If you don't want to.

29:57.215 --> 29:58.633
You can stay here.

30:00.218 --> 30:03.137
Yeah, I think I will stay here.

30:03.221 --> 30:05.139
He knew Henry lrving, too.

30:05.223 --> 30:07.308
I mean,
really interesting, you know?

30:07.392 --> 30:10.311
Why did they take
their pictures down?

30:10.395 --> 30:11.479
What do you mean?

30:11.563 --> 30:13.398
Their pictures.
They took them down.

30:13.481 --> 30:15.900
The hooks in the wall
and clean spaces

30:15.984 --> 30:18.736
and the one picture
that is there doesn't fit.

30:18.820 --> 30:20.155
I didn't notice that.

30:58.026 --> 30:59.861
Hi, dear.
We're not bothering you, are we?

30:59.944 --> 31:01.863
This is my dear friend
Laura-Louise McBurney,

31:01.946 --> 31:03.364
Lives up on 12.

31:03.448 --> 31:05.867
Laura-Louise,
this is Guy's wife Rosemary.

31:05.950 --> 31:07.410
Hello, Rosemary.
Welcome to the Bram!

31:07.452 --> 31:10.413
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
She wanted to meet you, too.

31:10.455 --> 31:11.915
Could we come in?

31:11.998 --> 31:13.416
Uh, of course. Please do.

31:13.458 --> 31:15.418
There you are.
Go ahead.

31:15.502 --> 31:18.254
Oh, look what you got.
There's a light.

31:18.338 --> 31:22.592
Oh, gosh!
Isn't that beautiful!

31:23.259 --> 31:24.344
It came this morning.

31:24.427 --> 31:26.179
Are you all right, dear?
You look worn.

31:26.262 --> 31:29.182
Oh, no. I'm fine.
It's the first day of my period.

31:29.349 --> 31:30.767
And you're up and around?

31:30.850 --> 31:32.769
On my first day,
I experienced such pain,

31:32.852 --> 31:34.270
I couldn't move, eat,
or anything.

31:35.688 --> 31:38.775
Dan used to give me gin
through a straw to kill the pain.

31:38.858 --> 31:41.694
Girls today take things
much more in their stride.

31:41.778 --> 31:43.696
They're much healthier
than we were,

31:43.780 --> 31:46.241
Thanks to vitamins, better medical care.

31:46.324 --> 31:48.409
What are those things over there,
seat covers?

31:48.493 --> 31:50.328
Um, cushions for the window seats.

31:50.411 --> 31:51.955
Oh, yeah.

31:56.125 --> 31:58.002
Oh, before I forget.

32:00.088 --> 32:02.298
This is for you
from Roman and me.

32:02.382 --> 32:03.842
For me?

32:03.883 --> 32:06.886
It's just a little present is all.
For moving in.

32:06.970 --> 32:07.720
There's no reason--

32:07.804 --> 32:10.265
It's real old.
It's over 300 years.

32:18.147 --> 32:19.357
It's lovely.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.360
Yeah. The green inside
is called tannis root.

32:22.443 --> 32:23.862
That's for good luck.

32:25.113 --> 32:27.407
It's lovely, but l--
I can't accept it.

32:27.490 --> 32:28.908
You already have.

32:28.992 --> 32:31.536
Put it on.
-Yeah.

32:32.912 --> 32:36.583
Ah, you'll get used to the smell
before you know it.

32:36.666 --> 32:38.126
Yeah, go on.

32:39.252 --> 32:42.338
Ohh, yes.

32:43.715 --> 32:46.342
Well, were his stories
as interesting as last night?

32:46.426 --> 32:48.386
Yes. Did you have a good time?

32:48.428 --> 32:49.554
All right.

32:49.596 --> 32:51.055
I got a present.

32:52.932 --> 32:54.392
It was Terry's.

32:54.434 --> 32:55.560
No kidding?

32:55.602 --> 32:57.061
Kind of pretty, though.

33:00.899 --> 33:03.318
Aren't you going to wear it?

33:03.401 --> 33:04.485
It smells.

33:05.153 --> 33:07.197
There's stuff in it
called tannis root

33:07.280 --> 33:08.698
from her greenhouse.

33:08.781 --> 33:10.200
Not too bad, though.

33:20.168 --> 33:21.252
Tannis, anyone?

33:21.336 --> 33:23.004
Well, if you took it,

33:23.046 --> 33:25.381
you ought to wear it.

33:43.024 --> 33:44.108
Hello.

33:44.192 --> 33:45.276
Yes.

33:45.360 --> 33:46.778
This is he.

33:53.034 --> 33:55.495
Oh, God, no.

33:57.539 --> 33:59.040
Oh, the poor guy.

34:00.208 --> 34:01.292
And, uh...

34:01.376 --> 34:04.295
They don't have any idea
what's causing it?

34:04.379 --> 34:06.297
Oh, my God.
That's awful.

34:06.381 --> 34:07.882
That's just awful.

34:10.051 --> 34:11.469
Yes, I would.

34:11.553 --> 34:13.471
I mean, yes, I am.

34:14.973 --> 34:17.934
I hate to get it
that way, but...

34:20.103 --> 34:22.063
Well, you'd have
to speak to my agent

34:22.105 --> 34:24.148
about that end of it.

34:25.608 --> 34:27.068
Alan Stone.

34:27.110 --> 34:28.777
I'm sure there won't be any problem,
Mr. Weiss,

34:28.862 --> 34:31.322
not as far as
we're concerned.

34:32.114 --> 34:33.658
Thank you, Mr. Weiss.

34:37.911 --> 34:39.164
Guy?

34:41.081 --> 34:42.542
What is it?

34:47.213 --> 34:49.674
Donald Baumgart--
he's gone blind.

34:49.716 --> 34:53.178
He woke up yesterday
and he can't see.

34:53.219 --> 34:54.304
Oh, no.

34:54.387 --> 34:56.347
Oh, I've got the part.

34:57.557 --> 35:00.768
It's a hell of a way
to get it.

35:05.481 --> 35:06.566
Listen, uh...

35:06.649 --> 35:08.109
I have to get out
and walk around.

35:08.193 --> 35:09.611
I understand.
Go ahead.

35:20.538 --> 35:23.500
Baumgart--
Donald Baumgart.

35:25.585 --> 35:27.170
It's a fascinating part.

35:27.253 --> 35:29.172
He'll really
be noticed this time.

35:29.255 --> 35:31.174
He also has an offer
for a lead

35:31.257 --> 35:33.676
in a television
series, Miami Beach.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.178
He's suddenly very hot.

35:35.261 --> 35:38.723
Mm-hmm. I understand
why you're so overjoyed.

35:38.806 --> 35:42.185
Well, it's a difficult
period in his life.

35:42.268 --> 35:43.353
A challenge.

35:44.437 --> 35:45.522
I see.

35:45.605 --> 35:47.023
You know how actors are.

35:47.106 --> 35:49.526
They're all a bit
self-centered.

35:49.609 --> 35:51.528
I'll bet even
Laurence Olivier

35:51.611 --> 35:53.530
is vain
and self-centered.

35:54.781 --> 35:56.199
It's a difficult part.

35:56.282 --> 35:58.701
He's got to work
with crutches

35:58.785 --> 36:01.162
and, naturally,
he's preoccupied.

36:01.204 --> 36:02.664
And he...

36:02.705 --> 36:05.500
well, preoccupied.

36:07.627 --> 36:10.588
I see you had another suicide
up there at happy house.

36:10.630 --> 36:12.090
Oh, didn't I tell you?

36:12.131 --> 36:13.591
No, you didn't.

36:13.633 --> 36:15.260
It was that girl
I told you about,

36:15.343 --> 36:18.304
the drug-addict who was rehabilitated
by this old couple, the Castavets.

36:18.346 --> 36:19.764
I'm sure I told you that.

36:19.848 --> 36:22.308
They didn't rehabilitate her
very successfully,

36:22.350 --> 36:23.601
it seems.

36:44.873 --> 36:46.332
I've been a creep.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.669
It's from worrying if Baumgart
would regain his sight,

36:49.711 --> 36:51.171
rat that I am.

36:51.212 --> 36:51.963
Oh, it's natural.

36:52.046 --> 36:53.840
You're bound to feel
two ways about it.

36:53.882 --> 36:55.842
Even if I'm Mr. Yamaha
for the rest of my days,

36:55.884 --> 36:57.844
I'm going to stop giving you
the short end of the stick.

36:57.886 --> 36:58.678
You haven't been.

36:58.720 --> 36:59.304
Yes, I have.

36:59.345 --> 37:02.098
I've been tearing my hair out
over my career.

37:02.265 --> 37:04.184
Let's have a baby.
All right?

37:04.851 --> 37:07.770
Let's have three babies, one at a time,
all right?

37:07.854 --> 37:09.272
A baby. You know.

37:09.355 --> 37:11.274
Mama, dada, poo-poo.
you know?

37:11.357 --> 37:12.775
You mean it?

37:12.859 --> 37:14.277
Sure, I mean it.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.112
I mean, I even figured out
the right time to start,

37:16.196 --> 37:17.280
Look.

37:18.364 --> 37:19.782
You mean it, really?

37:21.451 --> 37:24.370
No, I'm kidding.
Sure, I mean it.

37:24.454 --> 37:27.332
Oh, Ro, honey, for God's sake,
don't cry.

37:27.457 --> 37:30.335
I won't. I won't.

37:34.255 --> 37:35.673
Here goes nothing.

37:47.393 --> 37:48.811
Mmm-unh! The paint!

37:48.895 --> 37:50.522
The paint!

37:50.605 --> 37:51.898
Good grief.

38:00.532 --> 38:04.494
Nobody, but nobody
has a fire tonight.

38:10.041 --> 38:11.501
Isn't it gorgeous?

38:11.543 --> 38:14.546
I hope we have
the coldest winter ever.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.063
Oh, shit!

38:38.570 --> 38:41.030
Hi, Guy! How are ya?

38:41.072 --> 38:43.032
No, don't let her in.

38:43.074 --> 38:44.033
Not tonight.

38:44.075 --> 38:47.036
Oh, that's very kind of you.

38:50.540 --> 38:55.003
Oh, are you sure
you don't want to come in?

38:52.625 --> 38:55.587
No! I don't want
to bother you.

38:57.630 --> 38:58.923
Good.

39:00.842 --> 39:01.634
Good.

39:02.010 --> 39:04.762
Who says
there's nothing to ESP?

39:04.846 --> 39:07.640
Madame and monsieur shall
have ze dessert after all!

39:07.682 --> 39:09.100
Mousse au chocolat.

39:09.184 --> 39:11.603
Or as Minnie calls it--
chocolate mouse.

39:12.770 --> 39:15.064
I was afraid she'd stay
all evening.

39:15.148 --> 39:17.066
She just wanted us
to try it.

39:17.150 --> 39:19.611
Seein' it's one of her specialities.

39:19.694 --> 39:21.237
It was sweet of her, really.

39:21.321 --> 39:22.572
We shouldn't
make fun of her.

39:22.655 --> 39:24.616
Yeah, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

39:36.794 --> 39:39.380
Mmm! It's good.

39:54.646 --> 39:57.565
Has an undertaste.

39:57.649 --> 39:59.776
A chalky undertaste.

40:01.820 --> 40:03.238
I don't get it.

40:04.948 --> 40:07.242
That's silly, honey.
There is no undertaste.

40:07.325 --> 40:08.493
There is.

40:09.452 --> 40:12.664
Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
Now eat it.

40:12.747 --> 40:14.707
-I don't like it.
-It's delicious.

40:14.833 --> 40:16.459
Here. You can have mine.

40:16.584 --> 40:18.795
All right. Don't eat it.
There's always something wrong.

40:19.921 --> 40:22.340
Oh, if it's going to turn
into a big thing--

40:22.423 --> 40:23.675
Look, if you really
can't stand it,

40:23.758 --> 40:25.176
just don't eat it.

40:25.260 --> 40:29.180
Mmm! It's delicious!
No undertaste at all.

40:30.306 --> 40:32.934
Would you turn
the record over, please?

40:46.156 --> 40:48.575
There, Daddy,
do I get a gold star?

40:48.658 --> 40:50.577
You get two of them.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.537
I'm sorry
if I was stuffy.

40:52.620 --> 40:54.080
You were.

40:54.164 --> 40:56.124
...is making a full circle
of the ball park...

40:56.166 --> 40:57.625
It's the Pope
at Yankee Stadium!

40:57.667 --> 40:59.460
...to his specially built
canopy at second base.

40:59.502 --> 41:00.962
Put him out!

41:01.004 --> 41:02.964
Listen to that crowd roar.

41:03.006 --> 41:04.966
Everywhere the Pope
Has been today,

41:05.008 --> 41:06.467
he's received this type
of reception.

41:06.509 --> 41:08.970
As one man put it
This afternoon,

41:09.012 --> 41:10.972
"Perhaps we are being
undignified,

41:11.014 --> 41:12.473
but this is
a special day. "

41:12.557 --> 41:13.975
And a special day
it has been.

41:14.058 --> 41:16.978
That's a great spot
for my Yamaha commercial.

41:18.229 --> 41:21.149
I'd like to give you
a brief summary

41:21.232 --> 41:22.650
of today's
historic happening.

41:22.734 --> 41:25.653
Pope Paul VI arrived
at 9.:27A.M.

41:27.572 --> 41:28.990
What is it?

41:30.783 --> 41:31.993
Dizzy.

41:36.915 --> 41:37.999
Hey.

41:40.585 --> 41:41.669
No wonder.

41:41.753 --> 41:43.171
All that booze.

41:45.089 --> 41:48.635
You didn't eat anything
all day before dinner, huh?

41:53.765 --> 41:55.183
Hey.

41:55.266 --> 41:56.976
Hey.

42:20.208 --> 42:21.292
Nice.

42:21.376 --> 42:22.961
Sleep is what you need.

42:23.044 --> 42:24.462
A good night's sleep.

42:25.338 --> 42:27.173
We have to make a baby.

42:27.257 --> 42:30.176
Oh, we'll...
we'll do it.

42:31.177 --> 42:33.888
Tomorrow.
There's plenty of time.

42:34.305 --> 42:35.723
Just a nap.

43:14.137 --> 43:16.556
Why are you
taking them off?

43:16.639 --> 43:18.558
To make you
more comfortable.

43:18.641 --> 43:20.518
I am more comfortable.

43:20.602 --> 43:22.896
Sleep, Ro.

44:02.310 --> 44:05.396
Isn't Hutch
coming with us?

44:05.522 --> 44:06.606
Catholics only,

44:06.689 --> 44:10.610
I wish we weren't bound by these
prejudices,

44:10.693 --> 44:13.363
but, unfortunately...

44:57.991 --> 44:59.409
Easy, easy.

44:59.492 --> 45:01.327
You got her too high.

45:01.411 --> 45:03.329
Typhoon!
Typhoon!

45:03.413 --> 45:06.332
It killed 55 people
in London

45:06.416 --> 45:09.669
and it's heading this way!

45:15.383 --> 45:17.886
You better
go down below, Miss.

46:21.241 --> 46:22.617
She's awake.
She sees.

46:22.700 --> 46:23.409
She don't see.

46:23.493 --> 46:24.077
As long as
she ate the mouse,

46:24.118 --> 46:27.038
She can't hear.
She's like dead. Now sing.

46:37.674 --> 46:40.677
I'm sorry to hear
you aren't feeling well.

46:40.760 --> 46:43.012
It's only the mouse bite.

46:43.096 --> 46:45.598
You'd better have
your legs tied down

46:45.682 --> 46:47.433
in case of convulsions.

46:48.601 --> 46:51.104
Yes, I suppose so.

46:51.688 --> 46:54.149
There's always a chance
it was rabid.

46:54.190 --> 46:55.441
lf the music bothers you,

46:55.483 --> 46:58.444
Iet me know,
and I'll have it stopped.

46:58.486 --> 46:59.863
Oh, no, no, no.

46:59.946 --> 47:02.699
Please don't change
the program on my account.

47:03.449 --> 47:04.868
Try to sleep.

47:04.951 --> 47:08.288
We'll be waiting up on deck.

47:45.617 --> 47:49.078
This is no dream!
This is really happening!

47:58.213 --> 48:00.673
They tell me you have
been bitten by a mouse.

48:00.757 --> 48:03.676
Yes. That's why I couldn't come
to see you.

48:03.718 --> 48:04.844
That's all right.

48:04.886 --> 48:08.806
We wouldn't want you
To jeopardize your health.

48:09.891 --> 48:11.309
Am I forgiven, father?

48:11.392 --> 48:14.896
Oh, absolutely.

48:26.783 --> 48:29.077
Hey, it's after 9:00.

48:31.120 --> 48:32.163
Uhm.

48:34.624 --> 48:35.708
Five minutes.

48:35.792 --> 48:38.711
I have to be at Alan's
at 10:00.

48:39.796 --> 48:40.880
Eat out.

48:40.964 --> 48:42.465
Like hell I will.

48:53.393 --> 48:55.353
What time is it?

48:55.395 --> 48:57.272
It's 10 after 9:00.

48:58.398 --> 49:00.733
What time did I go to sleep?

49:00.817 --> 49:02.735
You didn't go to sleep.

49:02.819 --> 49:04.237
You passed out.

49:04.320 --> 49:06.739
From now on you get
cocktails or wine,

49:06.823 --> 49:09.450
Not cocktails and wine, hmm?

49:09.534 --> 49:12.078
The dreams I had.

49:16.374 --> 49:19.627
Don't yell.
I already filed them down.

49:20.712 --> 49:23.089
I didn't want to
miss baby night.

49:23.173 --> 49:25.842
A couple of my nails were ragged.
-While I was out?

49:25.884 --> 49:29.179
And it was kind of fun,
in a necrophile sort of way.

49:31.764 --> 49:35.935
I dreamed
someone was raping me.

49:36.019 --> 49:37.937
I don't know,
someone inhuman.

49:38.021 --> 49:39.981
Thanks a lot!

49:42.525 --> 49:45.111
What's the matter?
-Nothing.

49:46.529 --> 49:48.781
I didn't want
to miss the night.

49:48.865 --> 49:51.784
We could've done it
this morning or tonight.

49:51.868 --> 49:54.287
Last night wasn't
the only split second.

49:54.370 --> 49:57.790
I was a little bit loaded myself,
you know?

50:17.727 --> 50:19.187
Oh! Hello there.
Did ya like it?

50:19.270 --> 50:19.896
Oh, yeah.

50:20.021 --> 50:22.357
I think I put a little too much
cream de cocoa in it.

50:22.440 --> 50:23.525
No, no.
It was delicious.

50:23.608 --> 50:24.859
You'll have to give me
the recipe.

50:24.943 --> 50:26.861
Yeah, love to.
Oh, listen, you going shopping?

50:26.945 --> 50:28.446
Do me a teeny favor,
will ya?

50:28.530 --> 50:31.032
Get me six eggs, a small instant Sanka.
I'll pay you later.

50:31.074 --> 50:32.534
Right. Bye-bye.

50:42.794 --> 50:45.255
Don't you think we ought
to talk about it?

50:45.296 --> 50:46.381
About what?

50:47.048 --> 50:49.008
The way you haven't
been looking at me.

50:49.050 --> 50:51.219
What are you talking about?
I've been looking at you.

50:51.302 --> 50:52.428
You haven't.

50:52.470 --> 50:53.930
Why, sure, I have.

50:53.972 --> 50:56.933
Now, what is it?
What's the matter?

50:59.185 --> 51:00.812
Nothing. Never mind.

51:00.854 --> 51:03.064
No, no. Don't say that.
What is it?

51:03.148 --> 51:04.232
Nothing.

51:05.233 --> 51:06.234
Look, honey, l--

51:06.317 --> 51:08.570
I know I've been preoccupied
with the part and all,

51:08.653 --> 51:10.071
but it is important.

51:10.155 --> 51:12.574
That doesn't mean
I don't love you.

51:26.921 --> 51:29.257
It was due on Friday.

51:30.758 --> 51:31.843
It was?

51:33.261 --> 51:35.471
It'll probably come
tonight or tomorrow.

51:35.555 --> 51:36.806
- Wanna bet?
- Yeah.

51:36.890 --> 51:38.183
- A quarter.
- O.K.

51:38.266 --> 51:39.434
You're going to lose.

51:39.517 --> 51:40.685
Shut up, will you?

51:40.768 --> 51:41.686
You're getting me
all jumpy.

51:42.312 --> 51:43.897
It's only been two days.

51:44.522 --> 51:45.857
When will I know?

51:45.940 --> 51:48.359
I'll call you just as soon as I
get the results.

51:48.443 --> 51:50.528
I like to do
a general examination

51:50.612 --> 51:52.530
just to know
something more...

51:54.199 --> 51:57.118
It was Elise Dunstan who recommended
you to me, Doctor.

51:57.202 --> 51:58.203
Oh, yes.
How is she?

51:58.244 --> 52:01.122
She's fine. And the boys are great.
Did you deliver all of them?

52:01.831 --> 52:03.249
No, just the last.

52:03.333 --> 52:05.084
Universal hemoglobin.

52:05.168 --> 52:07.253
Yes, Doctor.

52:19.641 --> 52:21.100
We went to see
The Fantasticks.

52:21.142 --> 52:23.228
-Did you?
-Mmm.

52:23.269 --> 52:24.938
Did you enjoy it?
-Yeah.

52:24.979 --> 52:26.064
Good.

52:32.195 --> 52:33.279
Hello?

52:33.363 --> 52:34.280
Mrs. Woodhouse?

52:34.364 --> 52:35.240
Dr. Hill?

52:35.323 --> 52:36.407
Congratulations.

52:36.491 --> 52:38.743
-Really?
-Really.

52:41.454 --> 52:42.497
Are you there?

52:42.580 --> 52:44.999
Uh, yes, um,
what happens now?

52:45.083 --> 52:47.502
You come see me
next month.

52:47.585 --> 52:49.504
You get those Natalin pills.
One a day.

52:49.587 --> 52:52.006
I'll mail you forms
for the hospital.

52:52.090 --> 52:54.008
Uh, when will it be?

52:54.092 --> 52:56.010
It works out
to be June 28th.

52:56.886 --> 52:59.472
-That sounds so far away!
-It is.

52:59.556 --> 53:00.932
One more thing,
Mrs. Woodhouse,

53:00.974 --> 53:02.934
we'd like another
blood sample.

53:02.976 --> 53:04.435
Oh, yes, of course.

53:04.477 --> 53:05.562
What for?

53:05.645 --> 53:07.564
The nurse didn't take enough,

53:07.647 --> 53:09.649
so would you
drop by and see her?

53:09.732 --> 53:11.609
But I am pregnant,
aren't l?

53:11.693 --> 53:15.613
Oh, yes, it's just for blood samp--
Blood sugar and so forth.

53:15.697 --> 53:17.282
But you're pregnant.
Don't worry.

53:17.323 --> 53:19.868
All right.
Well, I'll come in on Monday.

53:19.951 --> 53:21.452
All right.
Don't forget the pills.

53:21.494 --> 53:22.495
No, I won't.

53:22.579 --> 53:24.831
-Goodbye, Mrs. Woodhouse.
-Goodbye, Dr. Hill.

53:27.125 --> 53:28.543
Blood sugar?

53:44.559 --> 53:45.810
What's that?

53:48.980 --> 53:50.190
Oh!

53:50.273 --> 53:51.316
That's great.

53:51.399 --> 53:52.942
That's just great.

53:53.026 --> 53:53.943
Father.

53:54.027 --> 53:55.069
Mother.

53:57.280 --> 53:59.324
Guy, Guy, listen.

53:59.407 --> 54:02.410
Let's, uh, make this
a new beginning, O.K.?

54:02.494 --> 54:04.746
A new openness in
talking to each other,

54:04.829 --> 54:06.915
because we haven't been open.

54:06.956 --> 54:10.210
That's true.
I've been so goddamned self-centered.

54:10.251 --> 54:11.794
That's what
the whole trouble is.

54:11.878 --> 54:14.047
You know I love you,
don't you, Ro?

54:14.130 --> 54:15.381
I do. I swear to God

54:15.465 --> 54:16.758
I'm going to be
as open and--

54:16.841 --> 54:18.134
It's my fault
as much as yours.

54:18.218 --> 54:19.969
No, bull, it's mine.
Now you bear with me.

54:20.053 --> 54:21.804
I'll try and do better,
you hear?

54:21.888 --> 54:23.556
Oh, Guy.

54:32.816 --> 54:33.900
What?

54:33.942 --> 54:35.235
It's...

54:35.276 --> 54:38.446
a fine way for parents
to be carrying on.

54:38.530 --> 54:40.490
Hey...

54:40.573 --> 54:42.075
know what I'd love to do?

54:42.158 --> 54:43.076
What?

54:43.159 --> 54:44.702
Tell Minnie and Roman.

54:44.786 --> 54:47.080
Oh, I know, I know.

54:47.163 --> 54:48.414
It's, uh...

54:48.456 --> 54:51.584
it's, uh, supposed to be
a deep, dark secret,

54:51.668 --> 54:54.337
but I already told them
that we were trying.

54:54.420 --> 54:56.923
They were so pleased.

54:57.006 --> 54:58.800
Tell them.

54:59.509 --> 55:00.844
Back in two minutes?

55:12.397 --> 55:14.232
You're pregnant.

55:16.985 --> 55:18.444
Another blood sample.

55:18.570 --> 55:19.529
Ta-da!

55:19.571 --> 55:22.782
Now, that's what
I call good news.

55:22.866 --> 55:25.869
Aw, honey,
congratulations.

55:25.952 --> 55:26.870
Thank you.

55:26.953 --> 55:29.664
-Best wishes, Rosemary.
-Thank you very much.

55:29.747 --> 55:31.416
We are more pleased
than we can say.

55:31.499 --> 55:32.959
We didn't have any
champagne on hand,

55:33.042 --> 55:34.794
but this will do
just as nicely.

55:34.836 --> 55:35.837
When are you due, dear?

55:35.879 --> 55:37.255
June 28th.

55:37.338 --> 55:38.798
Oh, it's going
to be so exciting.

55:38.882 --> 55:40.425
Listen, dear,
you got a good doctor?

55:40.508 --> 55:41.801
Oh, yes,
a very good one.

55:41.885 --> 55:43.344
One of the top
obstetricians

55:43.428 --> 55:45.597
is a dear friend of ours,
Abe Sapirstein.

55:45.680 --> 55:47.807
Delivers all
the society babies.

55:47.891 --> 55:49.017
Abe Sapirstein?

55:49.100 --> 55:51.102
One of the finest obstetricians
in the country.

55:51.186 --> 55:53.146
Wasn't he on Open End
a couple of years ago?

55:53.188 --> 55:54.147
That's right.

55:55.190 --> 55:56.399
Ro?

55:56.483 --> 55:58.943
Uh...
well, what about Dr. Hill?

55:59.027 --> 56:00.612
Don't worry about Hill.
I'll tell him something.

56:00.695 --> 56:01.905
You know me.

56:01.988 --> 56:04.115
Listen, I won't let you
go to no Dr. Hill

56:04.199 --> 56:05.617
nobody ever heard of.

56:05.700 --> 56:07.660
The best is what you're going to have,
young lady.

56:07.702 --> 56:09.162
Where's your telephone, huh?

56:09.204 --> 56:10.622
It's in the bedroom.

56:10.705 --> 56:11.915
He's a brilliant man.

56:11.998 --> 56:13.124
Very sensitive.

56:13.208 --> 56:15.168
Ro, sit down, sit down.

56:15.210 --> 56:16.628
No, I'm fine.

56:16.711 --> 56:19.047
Abe, Minnie. Fine.

56:19.130 --> 56:20.548
Listen, Abe,
a dear friend of ours

56:20.632 --> 56:22.884
just found out today
she's pregnant.

56:22.967 --> 56:25.803
Yeah, isn't it?
I'm in her apartment right now.

56:25.887 --> 56:28.014
We told her you'd be glad
to take care of her.

56:28.097 --> 56:31.267
You wouldn't charge her none of
your fancy society prices neither.

56:31.309 --> 56:32.811
Well, just wait a minute.

56:32.852 --> 56:35.230
Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11:00?

56:35.271 --> 56:36.189
All right.

56:36.272 --> 56:37.774
Yeah, 11:00's fine, Abe.

56:37.857 --> 56:40.944
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, you, too.

56:41.027 --> 56:43.071
No, no, no, no,
not at all.

56:43.154 --> 56:44.322
All right.
Well, let's hope so.

56:44.405 --> 56:46.074
Goodbye.

56:46.157 --> 56:47.992
Well, there you are.

56:48.076 --> 56:49.536
Thanks a million, Minnie.

56:49.661 --> 56:51.371
I don't know how to thank you.
Both of you.

56:51.454 --> 56:53.832
Just have a fine,
healthy baby, that's all.

56:54.874 --> 56:57.961
My, I can't wait to tell
Laura-Louise.

56:58.002 --> 56:59.212
Oh...

56:59.295 --> 57:02.590
uh, please don't tell anyone else,
not right away.

57:02.674 --> 57:05.134
No, she's right.
There's plenty of time.

57:05.260 --> 57:08.054
Now, to a fine, healthy baby.

57:08.096 --> 57:10.139
-Hear, hear.
-Hear!

57:11.766 --> 57:13.017
Andy.

57:15.645 --> 57:17.438
or Susan.

57:18.606 --> 57:20.441
Susan.

58:05.778 --> 58:07.989
Please don't read books.

58:08.072 --> 58:11.910
No pregnancy was ever exactly
like the ones described in the books.

58:12.619 --> 58:15.413
And don't listen
to your friends, either.

58:15.497 --> 58:18.666
No two pregnancies
are ever alike.

58:18.750 --> 58:22.253
Dr. Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
-No pills.

58:22.295 --> 58:25.215
Minnie Castavet
has a herbarium.

58:25.298 --> 58:27.342
I'm going to have her
make a daily drink for you

58:27.425 --> 58:29.677
that'll be fresher, safer,
and more vitamin-rich

58:29.761 --> 58:32.096
than any pills
on the market.

58:33.306 --> 58:35.850
Any questions you have,
call me night or day.

58:35.934 --> 58:38.812
Call me, not your Aunt Fanny.
That's what I'm here for.

58:38.895 --> 58:41.439
-Here.
-What's in it?

58:41.523 --> 58:44.359
Snips and snails
and puppy dogs' tails.

58:44.442 --> 58:46.319
That's fine,
but what if we want a girl?

58:46.402 --> 58:47.612
Do you?

58:48.530 --> 58:50.490
It would be nice if the first one
were a boy.

58:50.573 --> 58:54.160
Well, there you are.

58:55.411 --> 58:57.497
No, really, what is in it?

58:57.080 --> 58:59.207
A raw egg, gelatin, herbs.

58:59.290 --> 59:00.792
Tannis root?

59:00.875 --> 59:03.670
Some of that along
with some other things.

59:04.170 --> 59:07.131
Don't be so violent, Harry.
If you want to be stupid,

59:07.215 --> 59:08.716
be nonviolent stupid,

59:08.800 --> 59:11.261
I'm in love with no one.

59:11.302 --> 59:13.221
Especially not
your fat wife.

59:13.304 --> 59:15.557
I'm a hopeless cripple...

59:17.934 --> 59:19.352
What's that?

59:20.562 --> 59:22.981
I-I've been
to Vidal Sassoon.

59:23.064 --> 59:26.484
Don't tell me
you paid for that.

59:26.568 --> 59:28.069
Guy,

59:28.153 --> 59:29.654
I have a pain.

59:29.737 --> 59:30.697
Where?

59:30.780 --> 59:31.990
Here.

59:32.073 --> 59:33.449
Just now?

59:33.491 --> 59:34.784
Since Monday.

59:35.451 --> 59:36.661
A sharp pain.

59:36.703 --> 59:38.037
Did you see Sapirstein?

59:38.121 --> 59:39.497
I'm seeing him
on Wednesday.

59:39.622 --> 59:40.665
This is ridiculous.

59:40.790 --> 59:42.083
Why don't you see Sapirstein?

59:42.167 --> 59:43.543
Why didn't you say anything?

59:43.626 --> 59:45.795
I see him Wednesday
regular.

59:46.504 --> 59:48.548
An entirely natural
expansion of the pelvis.

59:48.631 --> 59:50.258
You can fight it
with ordinary aspirin.

59:50.341 --> 59:52.927
I was afraid it might be
an ectopic pregnancy.

59:53.011 --> 59:54.220
Ectopic?

59:54.846 --> 59:56.723
I thought you weren't
going to read books, Rosemary.

59:56.806 --> 01:00:00.059
-It was staring at me in the drugstore.
-All it did was worry you.

01:00:00.143 --> 01:00:02.353
Will you go home
and throw it away, please?

01:00:02.437 --> 01:00:04.606
The pains will
be gone in two days.

01:00:05.899 --> 01:00:07.692
Ectopic pregnancy!

01:00:51.402 --> 01:00:53.279
I look awful.

01:00:54.197 --> 01:00:57.575
What are you talking about?
You look great!

01:00:57.408 --> 01:01:00.203
It's that haircut
that looks awful.

01:01:00.286 --> 01:01:01.329
You want the truth, honey,

01:01:01.371 --> 01:01:04.332
that's the worst mistake
you ever made.

01:01:38.575 --> 01:01:39.450
My God!

01:01:40.577 --> 01:01:43.204
It's Vidal Sassoon.
It's very in.

01:01:43.288 --> 01:01:44.914
What's wrong with you?

01:01:44.998 --> 01:01:46.457
Do I look that bad?

01:01:46.541 --> 01:01:47.584
Terrible!

01:01:47.667 --> 01:01:49.836
You're not on one
Of those Zen diets, are you?

01:01:49.919 --> 01:01:50.837
No.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.005
Then what is it?

01:01:52.088 --> 01:01:53.256
Have you seen a doctor?

01:01:54.132 --> 01:01:58.011
Hutch, I might
as well tell you.

01:01:55.592 --> 01:01:56.509
I'm pregnant.

01:01:56.593 --> 01:01:57.719
Oh, rubbish.

01:01:57.802 --> 01:02:01.514
Pregnant women gain weight.
They don't lose it.

01:02:01.598 --> 01:02:03.183
I don't sleep well.

01:02:03.266 --> 01:02:06.144
I have stiff joints or something,
so I get a pain.

01:02:06.227 --> 01:02:07.187
Nothing serious.

01:02:07.896 --> 01:02:09.939
Well, congratulations.

01:02:10.023 --> 01:02:11.733
You must be very happy.

01:02:11.816 --> 01:02:14.027
Oh, I am.
We both are.

01:02:14.068 --> 01:02:15.904
Who's your obstetrician?

01:02:15.987 --> 01:02:17.697
Abraham Sapirstein.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:21.075
Oh! He delivered two
of my daughter's babies.

01:02:21.159 --> 01:02:22.911
He's one of the best
in the city.

01:02:22.994 --> 01:02:24.204
When did you
see him last?

01:02:24.287 --> 01:02:25.705
Um, yesterday.

01:02:25.747 --> 01:02:26.664
And?

01:02:26.748 --> 01:02:28.958
And he says
it's fairly common.

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:32.295
How much weight
have you lost?

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:35.632
Uh, 3 pounds.

01:02:35.715 --> 01:02:37.675
Nonsense. You've lost
far more than that.

01:02:38.301 --> 01:02:40.553
It's perfectly normal
to lose a little at first.

01:02:40.637 --> 01:02:42.180
Later on, I'll be gaining.

01:02:42.263 --> 01:02:43.681
Well...

01:02:44.557 --> 01:02:47.644
we must assume Dr. Sapirstein
knows where of he speaks.

01:02:47.727 --> 01:02:49.687
He should.
He charges enough.

01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:51.189
We're getting
bargain rates.

01:02:51.272 --> 01:02:53.191
Our neighbors are
close friends of his.

01:02:54.067 --> 01:02:55.026
I'll go.

01:02:55.068 --> 01:02:55.985
Stay where you are.

01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:58.363
It hurts less
when I move around.

01:03:00.865 --> 01:03:03.117
Oh, I was just
talking about you.

01:03:03.201 --> 01:03:04.369
Favorably, I hope.

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:05.870
Do you need anything
from outside?

01:03:05.954 --> 01:03:07.497
No. Thank you for asking.

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.998
Is Guy home already?

01:03:09.123 --> 01:03:10.792
He won't be home till 6:00.

01:03:10.875 --> 01:03:11.793
Oh.

01:03:11.876 --> 01:03:14.546
A friend of ours is here.

01:03:14.629 --> 01:03:16.840
Would you--
would you like to meet him?

01:03:16.881 --> 01:03:18.716
If I won't
be intruding.

01:03:18.716 --> 01:03:20.218
No. Please come in.

01:03:31.354 --> 01:03:34.357
Hutch, this is Roman Castavet.

01:03:34.649 --> 01:03:35.608
Edward Hutchins.

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:36.651
How do you do?

01:03:36.693 --> 01:03:37.777
Oh, how are you, sir?

01:03:37.819 --> 01:03:39.696
I was just telling Hutch
that it was you and Minnie

01:03:39.737 --> 01:03:41.114
who sent me
to Dr. Sapirstein.

01:03:41.156 --> 01:03:43.199
Oh, so Rosemary has told you
the good news.

01:03:43.283 --> 01:03:44.284
Yes, she has.

01:03:44.367 --> 01:03:46.161
We must see that
she gets plenty of rest.

01:03:46.202 --> 01:03:48.371
I was a bit alarmed
by her appearance.

01:03:48.454 --> 01:03:50.081
Well, she has lost
some weight,

01:03:50.123 --> 01:03:52.083
but that's quite normal
for the early months.

01:03:52.125 --> 01:03:55.003
Later on, she'll gain,
probably far too much.

01:03:55.086 --> 01:03:56.004
So I gather.

01:03:56.087 --> 01:03:57.547
Please sit down.

01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:00.466
Mrs. Castavet makes
a vitamin drink for me every day

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:02.010
from fresh herbs
she grows.

01:04:02.093 --> 01:04:04.888
Yes, all according to Dr. Sapirstein's
directions, of course.

01:04:04.929 --> 01:04:06.931
He's inclined
to be suspicious

01:04:07.015 --> 01:04:09.517
of commercially prepared
vitamin pills.

01:04:09.601 --> 01:04:11.978
Indeed?
But surely they're manufactured

01:04:12.061 --> 01:04:13.521
under every imaginable
safeguard.

01:04:13.605 --> 01:04:15.857
That's quite true,
but commercial pills

01:04:15.899 --> 01:04:17.942
can sit for months
on a druggist's shelf

01:04:18.026 --> 01:04:20.737
and lose a great deal
of their original potency.

01:04:20.778 --> 01:04:21.905
I hadn't thought of that.

01:04:21.946 --> 01:04:24.407
I like the idea of having everything
fresh and natural.

01:04:25.116 --> 01:04:28.411
I'll bet expectant mothers
chewed bits of tannis root

01:04:28.495 --> 01:04:30.497
when nobody'd even heard
of vitamin pills.

01:04:30.538 --> 01:04:31.581
Tannis root?

01:04:31.664 --> 01:04:33.625
It's one of the herbs
she puts in the drink.

01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:35.960
Or is it an herb?
Can a root be an herb?

01:04:36.002 --> 01:04:38.630
You sure you don't mean anise
or orris root?

01:04:38.713 --> 01:04:39.631
No, tannis.

01:04:42.383 --> 01:04:43.426
Look.

01:04:45.136 --> 01:04:47.847
It's good luck, too.

01:04:47.931 --> 01:04:49.974
Ish!

01:04:51.976 --> 01:04:54.479
Doesn't look like,
uh, root matter,

01:04:54.562 --> 01:04:57.148
more like mold or fungus
of some kind.

01:04:58.942 --> 01:05:00.318
Is it ever called
by any other name?

01:05:00.401 --> 01:05:02.320
Not to my knowledge, no.

01:05:03.738 --> 01:05:06.950
Tannis. I must look it up
in the encyclopedia.

01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:09.828
What a pretty holder
or charm or whatever it is.

01:05:09.911 --> 01:05:11.329
The Castavets gave it to me.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:12.872
You and your wife

01:05:12.914 --> 01:05:14.666
seem to be taking better care
of Rosemary

01:05:14.749 --> 01:05:15.750
than her own parents.

01:05:15.834 --> 01:05:18.336
We're very fond of her.
And of Guy, too.

01:05:18.419 --> 01:05:20.463
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll have to go.

01:05:20.547 --> 01:05:22.257
My wife is waiting for me.

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.675
It's a pleasure
to have met you.

01:05:23.758 --> 01:05:25.093
Oh, don't bother, Rosemary.

01:05:25.218 --> 01:05:27.720
We'll meet again, I'm sure.

01:05:30.431 --> 01:05:32.517
I just noticed
he has pierced ears.

01:05:33.351 --> 01:05:36.229
Pierced ears
and piercing eyes.

01:05:36.312 --> 01:05:37.981
What's she like?

01:05:38.982 --> 01:05:41.317
Nosy.
Funny.

01:05:41.359 --> 01:05:43.111
Guy's gotten
very close to them.

01:05:43.153 --> 01:05:44.612
I suppose they've become

01:05:44.654 --> 01:05:47.031
sort of parent figures for him.

01:05:48.783 --> 01:05:49.993
And you?

01:05:50.869 --> 01:05:52.620
I--I don't know.

01:05:52.745 --> 01:05:55.540
Sometimes I think they're too friendly
and helpful.

01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:58.751
Hey, what a surprise.

01:05:58.793 --> 01:05:59.836
How are you, Hutch?
Good to see you.

01:05:59.878 --> 01:06:01.171
You're the surprise.
What happened?

01:06:01.212 --> 01:06:03.840
They stopped for a rewrite,
those dumb bastards.

01:06:04.632 --> 01:06:06.718
Ah, stay where you are.
Nobody move.

01:06:06.801 --> 01:06:08.386
Would you like some coffee?

01:06:08.469 --> 01:06:09.470
Love some!

01:06:15.059 --> 01:06:16.102
Loot!

01:06:16.728 --> 01:06:18.813
Seems congratulations
are in order.

01:06:18.855 --> 01:06:20.064
Yeah, it's wonderful,
isn't it?

01:06:20.148 --> 01:06:21.232
When's the baby due?

01:06:21.316 --> 01:06:22.567
June 28th.

01:06:22.817 --> 01:06:24.402
Did you know
that Dr. Sapirstein

01:06:24.444 --> 01:06:26.654
delivered two of
Hutch's grandchildren?

01:06:26.738 --> 01:06:27.989
-Really?
-Mmm.

01:06:28.072 --> 01:06:29.532
I met your neighbor.

01:06:29.574 --> 01:06:30.533
Roman Castavet.

01:06:30.575 --> 01:06:32.035
Oh, did you?

01:06:32.076 --> 01:06:33.453
Funny old duck,
isn't he?

01:06:33.536 --> 01:06:35.538
Did you ever notice
he has pierced ears?

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.916
-You're kidding.
-No, I'm not. I saw.

01:06:37.957 --> 01:06:39.918
It's a shame we haven't
seen more of you lately,

01:06:39.959 --> 01:06:43.171
but with me being so busy
and Ro being the way she is,

01:06:43.254 --> 01:06:44.422
we really haven't
seen anyone.

01:06:44.464 --> 01:06:46.257
Perhaps we can have dinner
together soon.

01:06:46.299 --> 01:06:47.258
You're not going,
are you?

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:48.593
Thanks for the coffee, my dear.

01:06:48.635 --> 01:06:50.637
Thank you for coming,
my dear.

01:06:55.433 --> 01:06:57.769
This isn't mine.
It must be yours, right?

01:06:57.852 --> 01:06:58.853
Right you are.

01:06:58.937 --> 01:07:01.314
Have you thought about names,
or is it too soon?

01:07:01.356 --> 01:07:03.149
Andrew or Douglas
if it's a boy,

01:07:03.191 --> 01:07:04.651
Melinda or Sarah
if it's a girl.

01:07:04.692 --> 01:07:05.985
Sarah? What happened to Susan?

01:07:06.027 --> 01:07:08.112
Say, is there another
of these around?

01:07:08.196 --> 01:07:09.656
Oh.

01:07:14.702 --> 01:07:15.703
I don't see it, Hutch.

01:07:15.745 --> 01:07:17.580
No, it's not here.

01:07:18.206 --> 01:07:19.874
I probably left it
at the City Center.

01:07:19.916 --> 01:07:21.334
I'll stop back there.

01:07:21.417 --> 01:07:23.086
Let's really have that dinner,
shall we?

01:07:23.127 --> 01:07:24.087
Definitely.

01:07:24.128 --> 01:07:25.088
Next week.

01:07:25.129 --> 01:07:26.089
Bye.

01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:27.090
Goodbye.

01:07:27.131 --> 01:07:28.091
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:37.892
It was a nice surprise.

01:07:37.976 --> 01:07:40.228
Guess what he said.

01:07:40.979 --> 01:07:41.896
What?

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:43.398
I look terrible.

01:07:44.315 --> 01:07:45.150
Good old Hutch.

01:07:45.191 --> 01:07:47.277
He's spreading cheer
wherever he goes.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.529
I'm going to get a paper,
honey.

01:07:50.572 --> 01:07:52.407
He's a professional crepehanger.

01:07:52.365 --> 01:07:54.075
He's not a professional
crepehanger.

01:07:54.117 --> 01:07:56.119
Then he's one of the top-ranking
amateurs.

01:08:08.339 --> 01:08:09.257
Hello.

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:12.051
Oh, uh, she's not
feeling too well.

01:08:13.011 --> 01:08:15.096
Well, I think she's asleep.

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:16.430
All right.

01:08:17.474 --> 01:08:20.393
Oh, she could be, yeah.

01:08:20.477 --> 01:08:22.937
All right,
can you hold on a minute?

01:08:26.064 --> 01:08:27.859
It's Hutch.
He wants to speak to you.

01:08:27.901 --> 01:08:28.943
Oh.

01:08:29.611 --> 01:08:33.698
I told him you were resting,
but he said he couldn't wait.

01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:41.247
Hutch?

01:08:41.288 --> 01:08:43.707
Tell me, dear,
do you go out at all?

01:08:43.791 --> 01:08:47.337
Well, I--I haven't been going out,
why?

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:49.421
Can you meet me
tomorrow morning at 11:00

01:08:49.464 --> 01:08:51.633
in front of
the Time-Life building?

01:08:51.716 --> 01:08:53.259
Yes, if you want me to.

01:08:53.635 --> 01:08:55.553
What is it?
Can't you tell me now?

01:08:55.595 --> 01:08:56.805
I'd rather not.

01:08:56.845 --> 01:08:59.098
We can have an early lunch
if you like.

01:08:59.182 --> 01:09:00.225
That would be nice.

01:09:00.265 --> 01:09:01.225
Good. 11:00 then?

01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:02.227
O.K.

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:03.728
Oh, did you find your glove?

01:09:03.812 --> 01:09:05.063
No, they didn't have it.

01:09:05.145 --> 01:09:06.648
Good night, Rosemary.
Sleep well.

01:09:06.689 --> 01:09:08.566
You, too.
Good night.

01:09:09.192 --> 01:09:10.568
What was that?

01:09:10.609 --> 01:09:12.153
He wants to talk to me.

01:09:12.194 --> 01:09:13.154
What about?

01:09:13.196 --> 01:09:14.906
I don't know.
He wouldn't say.

01:09:15.657 --> 01:09:17.367
I think those
boys' adventure stories

01:09:17.408 --> 01:09:18.910
are going to his head.

01:09:21.246 --> 01:09:22.872
Where are you meeting him?

01:09:22.956 --> 01:09:26.960
Uh, Time and Life building
tomorrow at 11:00.

01:09:29.629 --> 01:09:30.921
This is ridiculous.

01:09:31.756 --> 01:09:33.299
You're pregnant,
I've got the yens.

01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:34.759
I'm getting an ice-cream cone.
You want one?

01:09:34.843 --> 01:09:36.344
Yeah, I'd love one.

01:09:36.386 --> 01:09:37.470
Vanilla?

01:09:37.595 --> 01:09:38.470
O.K.

01:09:38.595 --> 01:09:39.514
O.K.

01:10:01.953 --> 01:10:02.871
Hi.

01:10:02.954 --> 01:10:04.122
Minnie, I'm going out now,

01:10:04.205 --> 01:10:05.874
so I won't have
my drink at 11:00.

01:10:05.957 --> 01:10:07.458
That's fine, dear.
Take it later.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.460
Buzz me when you get back,
huh?

01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:40.366
Pain, be gone.
I will have no more of thee.

01:11:15.652 --> 01:11:16.778
Yes?

01:11:16.861 --> 01:11:18.738
Is this Edward Hutchins'
apartment?

01:11:18.822 --> 01:11:20.073
Yes. Who is this, please?

01:11:20.156 --> 01:11:22.158
My name is
Rosemary Woodhouse.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.868
I had an appointment
with Mr. Hutchins.

01:11:23.952 --> 01:11:26.329
Is he there?

01:11:26.371 --> 01:11:27.330
Hello?

01:11:27.372 --> 01:11:30.458
He was taken ill
this morning.

01:11:30.542 --> 01:11:32.669
-Taken ill?
-Yes.

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:35.338
He's in a deep coma at St. Vincent's
hospital.

01:11:36.047 --> 01:11:37.423
That's awful.

01:11:37.507 --> 01:11:41.594
I--I--I just spoke to him
last night about 10:30.

01:11:41.678 --> 01:11:43.304
I spoke to him
at 11:00.

01:11:43.346 --> 01:11:44.806
Who is this?

01:11:44.848 --> 01:11:46.266
You don't know me,
Rosemary.

01:11:46.349 --> 01:11:48.101
I'm Grace Cardiff,
Hutch's friend.

01:11:48.184 --> 01:11:51.020
Um, do they know
what's causing it?

01:11:51.062 --> 01:11:52.772
No, they don't know yet.

01:11:52.856 --> 01:11:54.983
At the moment, he's
totally unresponsive.

01:11:56.234 --> 01:11:58.319
Oh, I'm going
to the hospital now.

01:11:58.361 --> 01:11:59.779
Is there anything
I can do?

01:11:59.863 --> 01:12:00.905
Not really.

01:12:02.323 --> 01:12:04.367
All right, um,
thank you.

01:12:32.937 --> 01:12:34.189
No!

01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:36.941
This is what I call
the long arm of coincidence!

01:12:39.402 --> 01:12:42.363
I said to myself,
as long as Rosemary's going out,

01:12:42.405 --> 01:12:45.408
I might as well go out and do
a little bit of Christmas shopping.

01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:48.870
Now here you are, here I am.
Isn't that something?

01:12:48.953 --> 01:12:51.247
Aw, darling,
what's the matter?

01:12:51.289 --> 01:12:53.666
You feel all right?

01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:56.920
Aw...
aw, you poor thing.

01:12:56.961 --> 01:12:58.463
You know
what I think?

01:12:58.505 --> 01:13:00.340
I think we better
be going home now.

01:13:00.423 --> 01:13:01.424
What do you say?

01:13:01.508 --> 01:13:03.343
No, no, you have
your shopping to do.

01:13:03.384 --> 01:13:05.678
Ah, shoot,
there's two more weeks.

01:13:23.029 --> 01:13:25.031
It'll stop any day now.

01:13:25.073 --> 01:13:28.451
It's like a wire inside me
getting tighter and tighter.

01:13:28.535 --> 01:13:31.538
Usually older women
with less flexible joints

01:13:31.621 --> 01:13:33.540
have this sort of trouble.

01:13:33.623 --> 01:13:34.999
I'm not going out anymore.

01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:36.084
You don't have to.

01:13:36.125 --> 01:13:38.336
One minute to go!

01:13:39.462 --> 01:13:42.048
Rosemary,
I want you to meet Dr. Shand.

01:13:42.131 --> 01:13:44.342
He used to be
a famous dentist.

01:13:44.425 --> 01:13:46.302
He made the chain
For your charm.

01:13:46.386 --> 01:13:47.804
Oh, how do you do?

01:13:47.887 --> 01:13:49.305
Come on, sweetie.

01:13:49.389 --> 01:13:51.015
Put this wonderful hat on.

01:13:51.099 --> 01:13:53.226
Doctor, come over here.

01:13:53.309 --> 01:13:54.227
Minnie, Minnie.

01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:55.728
Happy New Year.

01:13:55.812 --> 01:13:57.856
Have a good year.

01:13:57.939 --> 01:13:59.357
Happy New Year.

01:14:01.985 --> 01:14:04.487
To 1966!

01:14:04.571 --> 01:14:06.614
The Year 1 !

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.919
What the hell are you doing?

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.004
Planning the menu.

01:15:03.087 --> 01:15:06.966
We're having a party
a week from Saturday.

01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:08.593
It's for our old--

01:15:08.676 --> 01:15:10.553
I mean, our young friends.

01:15:10.595 --> 01:15:12.722
Minnie and Roman
are not invited.

01:15:12.806 --> 01:15:14.766
Neither is Laura-Louise.

01:15:14.808 --> 01:15:16.476
Nor is Dr. Sapirstein.

01:15:16.559 --> 01:15:18.061
It's going to be
a very special party.

01:15:18.102 --> 01:15:20.480
You have to be
under 60 to get in.

01:15:26.611 --> 01:15:27.862
Well.

01:15:27.946 --> 01:15:29.280
For a minute there,

01:15:29.364 --> 01:15:31.074
I didn't think
I was going to make it.

01:15:31.115 --> 01:15:32.617
You'll make it,
all right.

01:15:32.659 --> 01:15:34.118
You can be bartender.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.787
Oh, swell.

01:15:36.579 --> 01:15:38.540
Do you really think
it's such a good idea?

01:15:38.581 --> 01:15:41.125
I think it's the best idea
I've had in months.

01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:44.128
Don't you think you ought to check
with Dr. Sapirstein first?

01:15:44.212 --> 01:15:46.214
What for?
I'm just giving a party.

01:15:46.297 --> 01:15:48.132
I'm not going to swim
the English Channel.

01:15:48.174 --> 01:15:49.634
What about the pain?

01:15:51.427 --> 01:15:52.887
Oh, haven't you heard?

01:15:53.096 --> 01:15:54.806
It'll go away
in a day or two.

01:15:54.848 --> 01:15:57.392
That looks interesting.
What's it for?

01:15:57.433 --> 01:15:59.394
We're having some people
over on Saturday.

01:15:59.435 --> 01:16:01.729
Oh, you feel up
to entertaining?

01:16:01.813 --> 01:16:03.398
Yes, I do.
These are old friends

01:16:03.481 --> 01:16:04.941
I haven't seen
in a long time.

01:16:05.066 --> 01:16:07.068
They don't even know yet
that I'm pregnant.

01:16:07.152 --> 01:16:08.444
I'll give you a hand
if you like.

01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:10.029
I'll help you
dish things out.

01:16:10.155 --> 01:16:12.240
No, thank you, Minnie,
but I can manage.

01:16:12.323 --> 01:16:13.992
It's going
to be a buffet,

01:16:14.075 --> 01:16:15.827
and we're getting
a bartender, so...

01:16:15.869 --> 01:16:17.245
I'll help you
take the coats.

01:16:17.328 --> 01:16:21.207
No, really,
you do too much for me as it is.

01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:25.587
Well, let me know
if you change your mind.

01:16:24.919 --> 01:16:27.380
Drink your drink now.

01:16:27.422 --> 01:16:28.882
I'd rather not.

01:16:29.591 --> 01:16:31.176
Not right this minute.

01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:33.261
I'll drink it
in a little while.

01:16:33.344 --> 01:16:34.929
It don't do
to let it stand.

01:16:35.013 --> 01:16:36.514
No, I won't wait too long.

01:16:36.598 --> 01:16:39.309
You go on back, and I'll bring
the glass back to you later.

01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:40.894
I'll wait.
I'll save you the walk.

01:16:40.977 --> 01:16:43.313
You'll do no such thing.
It makes me very nervous

01:16:43.396 --> 01:16:44.731
when people
watch me cook.

01:16:44.772 --> 01:16:45.732
Now, scoot.

01:16:45.773 --> 01:16:47.358
Don't let it
stand too long.

01:16:47.442 --> 01:16:49.360
It's going to lose its vitamins.

01:16:59.954 --> 01:17:04.167
You dirty, stinking secret-keeper.
Congratulations!

01:17:04.209 --> 01:17:06.461
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

01:17:07.879 --> 01:17:09.339
-Hey, Rosie.
-Yeah?

01:17:09.422 --> 01:17:11.466
Bob and Leo got stuck
at another party, dear,

01:17:11.508 --> 01:17:12.926
but they'll be over
right away.

01:17:12.967 --> 01:17:13.885
Oh, fine.

01:17:14.135 --> 01:17:17.472
Oh Rosie, you're so lucky.
It's a fantastic house.

01:17:20.183 --> 01:17:22.894
Hi.
It's been so long!

01:17:22.977 --> 01:17:26.147
You look like
a piece of chalk!

01:17:26.481 --> 01:17:28.858
You make him
feed you, luv.

01:17:31.653 --> 01:17:34.280
-Adrian Marcato lived here.
- Yeah, and the Trench sisters.

01:17:34.322 --> 01:17:36.449
-Trent sisters?
-Trench. They ate little children.

01:17:36.533 --> 01:17:39.077
He doesn't just mean
they ate them.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.412
He means
they ate them.

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.795
I made their first one strong
to get them happy,

01:17:48.878 --> 01:17:50.463
then I go light
and conserve, eh?

01:17:50.547 --> 01:17:54.634
Rosie, do you feel O.K.?
You look a little tired.

01:17:54.676 --> 01:17:56.970
Thanks for the understatement.

01:17:59.764 --> 01:18:02.100
How do you like C.C. Hill?
Isn't he a dream boy?

01:18:02.183 --> 01:18:04.018
Mm-hmm, but I--I--

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.353
I'm not going to him.

01:18:06.271 --> 01:18:07.272
You're not?

01:18:07.355 --> 01:18:11.234
I've got another doctor
named Sapirstein, an older man.

01:18:11.317 --> 01:18:12.735
Oh, congratulations, Papa.

01:18:12.819 --> 01:18:14.320
Thanks. Weren't nothing to it.

01:18:14.404 --> 01:18:15.864
Ro, I'm going to take
that dip inside.

01:18:15.905 --> 01:18:18.700
Oh, yeah, please.
See my flowers?

01:18:18.783 --> 01:18:19.742
Yeah.

01:18:20.243 --> 01:18:21.786
Elise, will you give me a hand?

01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:23.329
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:18:28.918 --> 01:18:30.128
Hey, whatever happened
to the other guy?

01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:32.630
-Is he still blind?
-Donald Baumgart?

01:18:32.672 --> 01:18:34.048
Well, you know who he is.

01:18:34.132 --> 01:18:35.800
He's the boy that Zoe Piper
lives with.

01:18:35.884 --> 01:18:37.343
He's writing a play.

01:18:37.385 --> 01:18:38.845
-Is he still blind?
-Excuse me.

01:18:39.637 --> 01:18:40.972
Yeah. He's going through hell

01:18:41.014 --> 01:18:42.807
trying to make
the adjustment.

01:18:42.891 --> 01:18:44.851
He dictates
and Zoe writes.

01:18:52.775 --> 01:18:54.319
Are you all right?

01:18:56.613 --> 01:18:58.031
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:18:58.114 --> 01:19:00.325
I just had a cramp
for a minute.

01:19:00.366 --> 01:19:01.326
Don't cry.

01:19:01.367 --> 01:19:03.703
It's all right. It's good for her.
Let her cry it out.

01:19:03.745 --> 01:19:05.371
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.

01:19:05.455 --> 01:19:06.915
Sit down, sit down.

01:19:12.795 --> 01:19:14.756
-Hey, let me in.
-Sorry, girls only.

01:19:14.839 --> 01:19:16.925
-I want to talk to Rosemary.
-You can't. She's busy.

01:19:16.966 --> 01:19:18.009
I have to wash these--

01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:19.260
Use the bathroom.

01:19:24.349 --> 01:19:25.809
It hurts so much!

01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:28.102
I'm so afraid
the baby's gonna die.

01:19:28.144 --> 01:19:30.563
When did the pain start?

01:19:30.605 --> 01:19:32.065
Um...

01:19:32.106 --> 01:19:34.067
in, uh, November.

01:19:34.108 --> 01:19:35.568
November?

01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:36.569
What?

01:19:36.653 --> 01:19:39.072
You have been in pain
since November,

01:19:39.113 --> 01:19:41.074
and he's not doing anything
to help you?

01:19:41.115 --> 01:19:43.076
He says it's gonna stop.

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:45.495
Why don't you go
to see another doctor?

01:19:45.537 --> 01:19:46.996
No, he's very good.

01:19:47.789 --> 01:19:49.833
He was on Open End.

01:19:49.874 --> 01:19:52.335
He sounds like
a sadistic nut.

01:19:52.377 --> 01:19:54.337
Rosemary,
pain like that

01:19:54.379 --> 01:19:57.841
is a warning that
something isn't right.

01:19:57.882 --> 01:19:59.843
Go see Dr. Hill.

01:19:59.884 --> 01:20:02.345
Go see anybody
besides that...that...

01:20:02.387 --> 01:20:03.346
That nut.

01:20:03.388 --> 01:20:05.640
You can't go on
suffering like this.

01:20:05.723 --> 01:20:07.183
I won't have
an abortion.

01:20:07.225 --> 01:20:09.185
Nobody's telling you
to have an abortion.

01:20:09.227 --> 01:20:11.896
Just go to see another doctor,
that's all.

01:20:20.864 --> 01:20:23.908
The thing to do now
is move.

01:20:23.992 --> 01:20:24.909
Guy?

01:20:24.993 --> 01:20:25.994
Yeah?

01:20:26.077 --> 01:20:29.539
I'm going to Dr. Hill
Monday morning.

01:20:30.456 --> 01:20:33.668
Dr. Sapirstein is either lying,
or he's...

01:20:33.751 --> 01:20:35.920
I don't know,
out of his mind.

01:20:36.004 --> 01:20:38.423
Pain like this is a warning
something's wrong.

01:20:38.506 --> 01:20:39.549
Rosemary...

01:20:39.632 --> 01:20:42.427
and I'm not drinking
Minnie's drink anymore.

01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:45.472
I want vitamins and pills
like everyone else.

01:20:46.639 --> 01:20:48.600
I haven't drunk it
for the last three days.

01:20:48.683 --> 01:20:49.726
I've thrown it away.

01:20:49.767 --> 01:20:50.685
You've what?

01:20:50.768 --> 01:20:52.729
I've made
my own drink.

01:20:54.355 --> 01:20:57.108
Is that what those bitches
were giving you in there?

01:20:58.359 --> 01:21:00.153
And is that
their hint for today?

01:21:00.195 --> 01:21:01.196
They're my friends--

01:21:01.279 --> 01:21:03.615
They're a bunch of
not very bright bitches

01:21:03.698 --> 01:21:05.783
who ought to mind
their own goddamn business!

01:21:05.825 --> 01:21:08.244
All they said was
get a second opinion.

01:21:08.328 --> 01:21:09.746
Rosemary, you got the best doctor
in New York.

01:21:09.829 --> 01:21:11.206
You know
who Dr. Hill is?

01:21:11.289 --> 01:21:12.707
He's a Charlie Nobody.

01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:13.917
That's who he is!

01:21:13.958 --> 01:21:17.712
I'm tired of hearing
how great Dr. Sapirstein is.

01:21:18.546 --> 01:21:20.882
Well, we'll have to pay Sapirstein,
we'll have to pay Hill.

01:21:20.924 --> 01:21:22.342
It's out of
the question.

01:21:22.425 --> 01:21:23.843
No, I'm not changing.

01:21:23.927 --> 01:21:26.888
I just wanna go to Dr. Hill
and get a second opinion.

01:21:27.138 --> 01:21:29.057
I won't let you do it, Ro.

01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:31.059
I mean,
because it's, uh...

01:21:31.142 --> 01:21:33.561
it's not fair
to Sapirstein.

01:21:33.645 --> 01:21:36.064
Not fair to...

01:21:36.147 --> 01:21:38.066
What are you
talking about?

01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:40.360
What about
what's fair to me?

01:21:40.401 --> 01:21:41.820
You want
a second opinion?

01:21:41.903 --> 01:21:45.949
You tell Sapirstein
and let him decide who gives it.

01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:48.409
No! I want Dr. Hill!

01:21:48.493 --> 01:21:50.411
At least have
that much courtesy--

01:21:50.495 --> 01:21:52.914
If you won't pay,
then I'll...

01:21:56.084 --> 01:21:58.002
Ro?

01:21:58.044 --> 01:21:59.462
Rosemary?

01:21:59.546 --> 01:22:00.964
What is it?

01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:04.259
It stopped.

01:22:05.009 --> 01:22:06.511
What?

01:22:06.594 --> 01:22:09.013
The pain stopped
just like that.

01:22:09.097 --> 01:22:10.932
Stopped?
-Stopped.

01:22:13.017 --> 01:22:15.937
What was in
that drink you made?

01:22:17.564 --> 01:22:18.481
Uh...

01:22:19.190 --> 01:22:22.110
eggs, milk, sug--

01:22:22.193 --> 01:22:23.611
sugar.

01:22:23.695 --> 01:22:25.113
What else?

01:22:28.283 --> 01:22:29.701
What else?

01:22:29.784 --> 01:22:34.706
Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sake,
what else was in that drink?

01:22:35.290 --> 01:22:37.250
It's alive!

01:22:37.333 --> 01:22:39.252
Guy, it's moving!

01:22:39.294 --> 01:22:41.754
It's alive!
It's all right!

01:22:41.796 --> 01:22:42.755
Feel.

01:22:42.839 --> 01:22:43.756
Feel.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.258
Oh, yeah, I felt it.

01:22:45.341 --> 01:22:47.177
Don't be scared.
It won't bite you.

01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:49.679
It's wonderful.
It really is.

01:22:49.762 --> 01:22:51.681
I feel it kicking.

01:22:51.764 --> 01:22:53.183
It's alive!

01:22:53.266 --> 01:22:55.185
It's moving!

01:22:59.272 --> 01:23:02.192
I'll, uh, clean up
some of this mess.

01:23:19.209 --> 01:23:20.668
Watch the walls.

01:23:29.719 --> 01:23:31.679
Thanks, boys.
Have one on the baby.

01:23:31.721 --> 01:23:33.181
Thank you very much.

01:24:02.502 --> 01:24:03.962
What's that for?

01:24:04.003 --> 01:24:06.464
This is
my hospital suitcase.

01:24:06.506 --> 01:24:08.967
Honey,
you got three weeks.

01:24:14.973 --> 01:24:15.890
Yes?

01:24:15.974 --> 01:24:17.892
Hello, Mrs. Cardiff.

01:24:20.478 --> 01:24:21.396
No.

01:24:22.981 --> 01:24:24.399
Oh, my God.

01:24:26.484 --> 01:24:27.902
Oh, my God.

01:24:27.986 --> 01:24:30.405
Yes, of course I will.

01:24:42.458 --> 01:24:43.835
Hutch is dead.

01:24:49.466 --> 01:24:50.884
I feel awful.

01:24:50.967 --> 01:24:54.387
All this time,
I didn't even think of him.

01:25:15.325 --> 01:25:17.243
Doris, we'll see you later.

01:25:17.327 --> 01:25:18.745
I beg your pardon.

01:25:18.828 --> 01:25:21.247
I'm Mrs. Woodhouse.
I knew your father.

01:25:21.331 --> 01:25:22.749
Oh, so you're Rosemary.

01:25:22.832 --> 01:25:23.750
I'm terribly sorry.

01:25:23.833 --> 01:25:25.793
Thank you.
This is my sister Edna.

01:25:25.835 --> 01:25:26.753
How do you do?

01:25:26.836 --> 01:25:28.254
And my husband.

01:25:28.338 --> 01:25:29.255
How do you do?

01:25:29.339 --> 01:25:30.256
I'm sorry to be late.

01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:31.257
Excuse me.

01:25:31.341 --> 01:25:32.258
Yes?

01:25:32.342 --> 01:25:33.259
I'm Grace Cardiff.

01:25:33.343 --> 01:25:34.761
I was hoping to meet you.

01:25:34.844 --> 01:25:36.262
Thank you for calling me.

01:25:36.346 --> 01:25:37.388
I was going to mail this,

01:25:37.472 --> 01:25:38.765
but then I thought you
were going to be here.

01:25:38.848 --> 01:25:40.892
What is it?
-A book.

01:25:40.975 --> 01:25:43.269
Hutch regained consciousness
at the end,

01:25:43.353 --> 01:25:45.271
and he thought it was
the next morning.

01:25:45.772 --> 01:25:46.981
You know,
when you had the appointment.

01:25:47.023 --> 01:25:47.941
Oh, yes.

01:25:49.025 --> 01:25:50.652
I wasn't there,
but he told the doctor

01:25:50.693 --> 01:25:53.112
to make sure you got the book
that was on his desk.

01:25:53.196 --> 01:25:54.531
Thank you.

01:25:55.949 --> 01:25:57.951
Oh, and I'm to tell you
the name is an anagram.

01:25:58.660 --> 01:25:59.744
The name of the book?

01:26:00.286 --> 01:26:01.538
Apparently.

01:26:01.621 --> 01:26:04.916
He was delirious,
so it's hard to be sure.

01:26:29.983 --> 01:26:30.942
I heard you come in.

01:26:30.984 --> 01:26:32.402
It certainly
wasn't very long.

01:26:32.485 --> 01:26:34.154
I was late.
I couldn't get a taxi.

01:26:34.195 --> 01:26:35.613
Oh, what a shame.

01:26:35.697 --> 01:26:37.615
Oh, you got mail already?

01:26:37.699 --> 01:26:39.617
Somebody gave it to me.

01:26:39.701 --> 01:26:42.120
Here. I'll hold it.

01:26:42.203 --> 01:26:43.830
Book.

01:26:44.914 --> 01:26:47.959
Oh, I know that house.
The Gilmores used to live there.

01:26:48.042 --> 01:26:49.544
Oh?
-Yeah.

01:26:49.752 --> 01:26:51.337
I've been there
lots of times.

01:26:51.421 --> 01:26:53.840
Grace-- That's one
of my favorite names.

01:26:53.923 --> 01:26:54.841
Yes.

01:26:54.924 --> 01:26:56.342
You need anything?

01:26:56.426 --> 01:26:57.343
Nothing, thank you.

01:26:57.427 --> 01:26:58.344
Take a nap,
why don't you?

01:26:58.428 --> 01:26:59.345
I'm going to.

01:26:59.429 --> 01:27:00.346
Yeah. Goodbye.

01:27:42.597 --> 01:27:45.016
"Born in Glasgow in 1846,

01:27:45.099 --> 01:27:47.519
He was soon after
brought to New York.

01:27:47.602 --> 01:27:50.522
He resided for several years
in the United St--

01:27:50.605 --> 01:27:55.026
He was attacked by a mob
outside the Bram..."

01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:58.571
Outside, not in the lobby.

01:28:07.455 --> 01:28:08.873
There are no witches.

01:28:08.957 --> 01:28:10.333
Not really.

01:28:13.419 --> 01:28:15.338
The name is an anagram.

01:29:38.296 --> 01:29:40.423
Now, that really makes sense.

01:29:42.509 --> 01:29:43.927
Poor Hutch.

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.317
Ro?

01:30:45.905 --> 01:30:47.323
What's with the chain?

01:30:51.077 --> 01:30:52.537
What's the matter?

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.499
You all right?
-I'm fine.

01:30:56.583 --> 01:30:58.001
Oh.

01:30:58.084 --> 01:30:59.544
Oh, why, thank you.

01:30:59.586 --> 01:31:01.546
How was the funeral?

01:31:01.588 --> 01:31:02.714
O.K.

01:31:02.755 --> 01:31:05.258
Got the shirt
that was in the New Yorker.

01:31:10.263 --> 01:31:12.056
I got that shirt
that was in the New Yorker.

01:31:12.682 --> 01:31:14.100
That's nice.

01:31:14.184 --> 01:31:16.102
Do you know
who Roman really is?

01:31:16.186 --> 01:31:17.312
What do you mean,
honey?

01:31:17.353 --> 01:31:18.771
He's Adrian Marcato's son.

01:31:18.855 --> 01:31:19.772
What?

01:31:19.856 --> 01:31:21.274
Come here.

01:31:21.357 --> 01:31:24.277
I want to show you something.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:28.281
Roman Castavet
is Steven Marcato rearranged.

01:31:29.866 --> 01:31:31.284
It's from Hutch.

01:31:37.874 --> 01:31:38.791
Look.

01:31:40.376 --> 01:31:41.794
And look here.

01:31:41.878 --> 01:31:43.797
There he is when he was 13.

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:45.298
See the eyes?

01:31:47.884 --> 01:31:48.802
Coincidence.

01:31:48.885 --> 01:31:50.303
In the same house?

01:31:50.386 --> 01:31:51.805
And look. Look here.

01:31:51.888 --> 01:31:54.307
"Soon after that
in August, 1886,

01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:56.309
his son Steven
was born."

01:31:56.392 --> 01:31:57.811
1886. Got it?

01:31:57.894 --> 01:31:59.813
That makes him 79 now.

01:31:59.896 --> 01:32:01.314
No coincidence.

01:32:06.402 --> 01:32:07.821
No, I guess not.

01:32:08.988 --> 01:32:11.825
He's Steven Marcato,
all right.

01:32:11.908 --> 01:32:12.826
Poor old geezer.

01:32:12.909 --> 01:32:14.118
With a crazy father
like that,

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:16.579
no wonder he switched
his name around.

01:32:16.663 --> 01:32:18.581
You don't think
he's the same?

01:32:18.665 --> 01:32:20.583
What do you mean,
a witch?

01:32:20.667 --> 01:32:22.085
Ro, are you kidding?

01:32:22.168 --> 01:32:23.586
Oh, Ro, honey.

01:32:25.338 --> 01:32:28.633
His father was a martyr to it.
Do you know how he died?

01:32:28.675 --> 01:32:30.593
Honey, it's 1966.

01:32:30.677 --> 01:32:33.429
This was published
in 1933.

01:32:33.555 --> 01:32:34.764
There were covens
in Europe.

01:32:34.806 --> 01:32:37.642
That's what they're called--
the congregation.

01:32:38.059 --> 01:32:40.520
Covens in Europe, in America,
and in Australia,

01:32:40.562 --> 01:32:42.981
and they have one right here,
that whole bunch.

01:32:43.064 --> 01:32:45.608
The parties with the singing
and the flute and the chanting,

01:32:45.650 --> 01:32:47.485
those are esbats or sabbaths
or whatever they're called.

01:32:47.527 --> 01:32:48.653
Honey, don't get excited.

01:32:48.695 --> 01:32:50.113
Read what they do, Guy.

01:32:50.196 --> 01:32:52.115
They use blood
in their rituals.

01:32:52.198 --> 01:32:55.118
The blood that has the most power
is baby's blood.

01:32:55.201 --> 01:32:57.120
And they don't just use the blood,
they use the flesh, too.

01:32:57.203 --> 01:32:58.621
Rosemary,
for God's sakes!

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.457
They're not setting foot
in this apartment ever again.

01:33:01.583 --> 01:33:03.960
They're not coming within 50 feet
of the baby.

01:33:04.002 --> 01:33:04.919
They're old people.

01:33:05.003 --> 01:33:06.421
They have a bunch
of old friends.

01:33:06.504 --> 01:33:08.923
Dr. Shand happens
to play the recorder.

01:33:09.007 --> 01:33:11.885
I'm not taking any chances
with the baby's safety.

01:33:11.926 --> 01:33:13.386
We're gonna sublet
and move out.

01:33:13.428 --> 01:33:14.888
We are not.
-Oh, yes we are!

01:33:14.929 --> 01:33:16.848
We'll talk about it later.

01:33:19.934 --> 01:33:22.479
I don't think you ought
to read any more of that.

01:33:23.313 --> 01:33:25.857
-Just this last chapter.
-Not today, honey.

01:33:27.025 --> 01:33:29.360
Look. Your hands are shaking.
Come on. Give it to me.

01:33:29.402 --> 01:33:31.196
Read it tomorrow.
-Guy!

01:33:31.279 --> 01:33:32.739
I mean it, now.

01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:34.240
Give it to me.

01:33:41.664 --> 01:33:44.584
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

01:33:44.792 --> 01:33:46.294
What'd you say the name was,
"Marchado"?

01:33:46.336 --> 01:33:47.462
Marcato.

01:33:47.504 --> 01:33:49.881
He told me his father
was a coffee importer.

01:33:50.131 --> 01:33:51.591
He told Guy
he was a producer.

01:33:51.633 --> 01:33:53.343
I understand
how disturbed you must be

01:33:53.384 --> 01:33:54.844
to have him for
a close neighbor.

01:33:54.886 --> 01:33:57.347
I don't want anything more
to do with him or Minnie.

01:33:57.388 --> 01:34:00.850
I can't take even the slightest chance
for the baby's sake.

01:34:00.892 --> 01:34:03.353
Absolutely.
Any mother'd feel the same way.

01:34:03.394 --> 01:34:05.355
Is there
any chance at all

01:34:05.396 --> 01:34:07.357
that maybe Minnie put something
harmful in those drinks

01:34:07.398 --> 01:34:08.858
or in those
little cakes?

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:12.278
No, Rosemary, I'd have seen evidence
of it long ago.

01:34:13.154 --> 01:34:14.906
I won't take anything else
from them.

01:34:14.989 --> 01:34:15.907
You won't have to.

01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:17.408
I can give you some pills

01:34:17.492 --> 01:34:20.411
that'll be adequate
these last few weeks.

01:34:20.495 --> 01:34:23.414
In a way,
this may be the answer

01:34:23.498 --> 01:34:25.416
to Minnie's and
Roman's problem, too.

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:26.918
What do you mean?

01:34:27.001 --> 01:34:28.419
Roman's very ill.

01:34:28.503 --> 01:34:32.423
In fact, confidentially, he has
no more than a month or two left.

01:34:32.507 --> 01:34:33.925
I had no idea.

01:34:34.008 --> 01:34:36.427
He wanted to pay a last visit
to a few of his favorite cities.

01:34:36.511 --> 01:34:37.428
They didn't want
to offend you

01:34:37.512 --> 01:34:39.430
by leaving before
the baby's birth.

01:34:40.056 --> 01:34:41.975
I'm sorry to hear
that Roman isn't well.

01:34:42.058 --> 01:34:43.476
He'd be
extremely embarrassed

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.979
if he knew
what you found out.

01:34:46.062 --> 01:34:46.980
Suppose we do this.

01:34:47.063 --> 01:34:48.565
I'll tell him
to leave on Sunday.

01:34:48.606 --> 01:34:50.692
I'll say I spoke to you
and you understand.

01:34:51.025 --> 01:34:53.444
Are you sure they'll
leave on Sunday?

01:34:53.528 --> 01:34:54.946
I'll see to it.

01:34:57.615 --> 01:34:59.075
No matter
where we are,

01:34:59.117 --> 01:35:00.702
our thoughts are gonna be with you
every minute

01:35:00.785 --> 01:35:03.037
till you're all
happy and thin again.

01:35:03.121 --> 01:35:06.124
Your sweet little boy or girl
laying safely in your arms.

01:35:06.166 --> 01:35:07.625
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

01:35:07.667 --> 01:35:10.044
Yeah. You make Guy
send us lots of pictures, ya hear?

01:35:10.128 --> 01:35:11.546
Yes, I will.

01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:13.047
Now, I'm not going
to wish you good luck

01:35:13.131 --> 01:35:14.549
because you
won't need it.

01:35:14.632 --> 01:35:17.051
You're going to have
a happy, happy life.

01:35:17.135 --> 01:35:19.554
Have a good trip
and come back safely.

01:35:19.637 --> 01:35:23.558
Perhaps. But I may stay in Dubrovnik
or Pescara

01:35:23.641 --> 01:35:25.101
or maybe Majorca.

01:35:25.143 --> 01:35:27.103
We shall see,
we shall see.

01:35:27.145 --> 01:35:28.104
Come back.

01:35:28.146 --> 01:35:29.105
Bye, Minnie.

01:35:29.147 --> 01:35:30.106
Yeah, goodbye.

01:35:30.148 --> 01:35:31.566
Goodbye, Roman.
Bye-bye.

01:35:31.691 --> 01:35:33.109
Take care now.

01:35:33.193 --> 01:35:35.236
Kennedy Airport,
Pan Am Building.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:36.613
Bye!

01:35:36.696 --> 01:35:37.906
Bye, Roman.

01:35:40.575 --> 01:35:41.993
Oh, boy.

01:35:48.249 --> 01:35:49.250
Guy?

01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:49.876
Hmm?

01:35:49.959 --> 01:35:51.544
Where's my book?

01:35:51.628 --> 01:35:55.131
Oh, I put it
in the garbage.

01:35:56.674 --> 01:35:57.592
What?

01:35:57.675 --> 01:36:00.428
I didn't want you
upsetting yourself anymore.

01:36:00.512 --> 01:36:02.472
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.

01:36:02.514 --> 01:36:03.973
He left it to me.

01:36:04.015 --> 01:36:05.475
I wasn't thinking
about that.

01:36:05.517 --> 01:36:06.976
That's a terrible thing to do.

01:36:07.018 --> 01:36:09.979
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.

01:36:16.486 --> 01:36:18.404
Hey, watch out, lady!

01:37:12.542 --> 01:37:17.922
"Some cultures believed that a personal
possession of the victim is necessary

01:37:17.964 --> 01:37:19.799
and spells cannot be cast

01:37:19.841 --> 01:37:22.760
without one of the victim's
belongings."

01:37:22.844 --> 01:37:23.761
Yeah?

01:37:24.512 --> 01:37:25.930
Is this Donald Baumgart?

01:37:26.014 --> 01:37:26.931
That's right.

01:37:27.682 --> 01:37:29.559
This is Rosemary Woodhouse,

01:37:29.642 --> 01:37:31.060
Guy Woodhouse's wife.

01:37:31.144 --> 01:37:32.061
Oh, yes.

01:37:32.145 --> 01:37:33.563
I want to know--

01:37:33.646 --> 01:37:36.065
You must be
a happy little lady,

01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:38.568
living in the Bram,
rows of uniformed lackeys.

01:37:38.651 --> 01:37:40.069
I wanted to know
how you are,

01:37:40.153 --> 01:37:41.154
if there's been
any improvement.

01:37:41.237 --> 01:37:42.655
Well, bless your heart.

01:37:44.657 --> 01:37:46.075
Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?

01:37:46.159 --> 01:37:47.577
Well, I'm splendid.

01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:51.080
I only broke
six glasses today.

01:37:52.165 --> 01:37:54.584
Guy and I
are both very unhappy

01:37:54.667 --> 01:37:59.088
that he got his break
because of your misfortune.

01:38:00.632 --> 01:38:02.550
Aw, what the hell.

01:38:02.634 --> 01:38:05.553
That's the way it goes, right?

01:38:05.637 --> 01:38:10.058
I'm sorry I didn't come along that day
he came to visit you.

01:38:10.141 --> 01:38:11.976
V-Visit?

01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:15.480
Oh, you mean the day
we met for drinks?

01:38:16.022 --> 01:38:18.441
Yes, that's what I meant.

01:38:19.108 --> 01:38:21.945
By the way,
he has something of yours, you know.

01:38:22.028 --> 01:38:23.446
What do you mean?

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:25.448
Don't you know?

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:26.449
No.

01:38:26.533 --> 01:38:28.952
Didn't you miss anything
that day?

01:38:30.411 --> 01:38:33.456
You don't mean my tie,
do you?

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:34.207
Yes.

01:38:34.290 --> 01:38:37.544
Oh, well, he's got mine,
and I've got his.

01:38:38.545 --> 01:38:39.796
He can have it back.

01:38:39.879 --> 01:38:41.047
I'm sorry.

01:38:41.131 --> 01:38:44.801
Doesn't matter to me now
what color tie I'm wearing.

01:38:44.884 --> 01:38:47.303
I didn't understand.
I thought he'd only borrowed it.

01:38:47.387 --> 01:38:50.306
Oh, no.
It was a trade.

01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:51.808
Or...

01:38:51.891 --> 01:38:53.810
do you think
he stole it?

01:38:53.893 --> 01:38:55.812
I have to hang up now.

01:38:55.895 --> 01:38:58.815
I just wanted to know if there'd been
any improvement.

01:38:58.898 --> 01:39:00.316
No, no, there isn't.

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:03.319
It was nice of you to call. Bye.

01:39:40.690 --> 01:39:42.317
You aren't in labor,
are you?

01:39:42.358 --> 01:39:44.319
No, but I have
to see the doctor.

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:45.320
It's very important.

01:39:45.361 --> 01:39:46.821
But he has to leave
at 5:00,

01:39:46.863 --> 01:39:48.823
and there is Mrs. Byron.

01:39:48.865 --> 01:39:50.825
I'm sure he'll see you.
Just sit down.

01:39:50.867 --> 01:39:51.826
Thank you.

01:40:13.848 --> 01:40:15.767
How is it out there?

01:40:15.850 --> 01:40:18.228
Oh, awful. 94.

01:40:18.311 --> 01:40:19.270
Ugh!

01:40:19.354 --> 01:40:21.272
See you next week.
Make an appointment.

01:40:21.356 --> 01:40:22.774
Yes, I will.

01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:30.698
You're due any day now,
aren't you?

01:40:30.782 --> 01:40:31.324
Tuesday.

01:40:31.366 --> 01:40:34.327
You're smart to get it over with
before August.

01:40:35.662 --> 01:40:36.579
Mrs. Byron.

01:40:37.747 --> 01:40:40.166
He'll see you right after.

01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:42.252
Well, let's see, um...

01:40:42.293 --> 01:40:43.753
July the 10th?

01:40:43.795 --> 01:40:45.171
What time?

01:40:45.255 --> 01:40:46.172
4:00?

01:40:46.256 --> 01:40:47.173
Fine.

01:40:47.257 --> 01:40:48.675
All right.
See you then.

01:40:48.758 --> 01:40:50.093
Thank you.
-Bye-bye.

01:40:50.135 --> 01:40:51.094
Good luck.

01:40:51.136 --> 01:40:52.345
Thank you.

01:40:59.561 --> 01:41:02.438
Mmm! That smells nice.
What is it?

01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:05.316
Oh, my--

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.819
It's called detchema.

01:41:07.902 --> 01:41:09.571
Well, it's a big improvement
on your regular,

01:41:09.654 --> 01:41:11.030
if you don't mind
my saying.

01:41:11.072 --> 01:41:12.532
That wasn't a perfume.

01:41:12.574 --> 01:41:13.825
That was a good luck charm.

01:41:13.867 --> 01:41:14.826
I threw it away.

01:41:14.868 --> 01:41:15.952
Good.

01:41:16.744 --> 01:41:20.206
Maybe the doctor will follow
your example.

01:41:24.210 --> 01:41:25.670
Dr. Sapirstein?

01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:27.172
Yes. The aftershave.

01:41:27.213 --> 01:41:29.174
Well, it isn't, is it?

01:41:29.215 --> 01:41:31.551
I don't think he has
a good luck charm.

01:41:31.634 --> 01:41:34.095
Anyway, he has the same smell
once in a while.

01:41:34.971 --> 01:41:36.931
When he does--
Oh, boy.

01:41:37.807 --> 01:41:39.559
Haven't you ever noticed?

01:41:39.642 --> 01:41:41.102
No.

01:41:41.144 --> 01:41:44.397
Well, maybe you thought it was your own
you were smelling.

01:41:44.481 --> 01:41:46.941
What is it,
a chemical thing?

01:41:47.859 --> 01:41:50.195
Will you excuse me a moment,
please?

01:41:50.278 --> 01:41:51.613
My husband
is waiting outside.

01:41:51.696 --> 01:41:53.615
I have to go
and tell him something.

01:41:53.698 --> 01:41:55.533
I'll be back in a minute.

01:42:43.748 --> 01:42:45.208
Dr. Hill's office.

01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:46.209
Dr. Hill, please.

01:42:46.251 --> 01:42:47.710
This is his
answering service.

01:42:47.752 --> 01:42:50.213
Would you like
to leave a message?

01:42:50.255 --> 01:42:54.217
Um, yes.
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.

01:42:54.259 --> 01:42:55.718
Woodhouse.

01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:00.223
And would you ask him to call me back
right away, please?

01:43:00.265 --> 01:43:05.228
Uh, my number is
475-2598.

01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:07.730
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.

01:43:07.772 --> 01:43:08.731
All right.

01:43:18.741 --> 01:43:21.661
Quickly, please,
Dr. Hill, call me.

01:43:28.751 --> 01:43:30.170
Oh, oh, really?

01:43:30.253 --> 01:43:32.172
Did he really say that?

01:43:32.255 --> 01:43:34.674
Oh, he didn't say that.

01:43:34.757 --> 01:43:37.677
What else was it
that he said?

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:39.179
Oh, that's wonderful.

01:43:39.262 --> 01:43:41.681
That's wonder--
That's marvelous.

01:43:42.765 --> 01:43:43.683
Yes. Dr. Hill?

01:43:43.766 --> 01:43:44.684
Did I get the name right?

01:43:44.767 --> 01:43:46.186
Is it Rosemary Woodhouse?

01:43:46.269 --> 01:43:47.187
Yes.

01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:49.189
Are you Dr. Hill's patient?

01:43:49.272 --> 01:43:50.231
No.

01:43:50.315 --> 01:43:53.693
Um, yes, I mean,
well, I've seen him once.

01:43:53.776 --> 01:43:56.821
Um, please, please tell him
he has to speak to me.

01:43:56.863 --> 01:43:57.780
It's important.

01:43:58.656 --> 01:44:00.158
Tell him to call me, hmm?

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.118
-All right.
-Thank you.

01:44:09.125 --> 01:44:10.460
All of them.

01:44:10.543 --> 01:44:11.961
All of them.

01:44:12.045 --> 01:44:13.963
All in it together.

01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:15.465
All of them.

01:44:15.548 --> 01:44:17.467
All of them witches.

01:44:17.550 --> 01:44:19.969
Don't you worry,
little Andy or Jenny,

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:23.473
I'll kill them before
I let them touch you.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:28.478
Yes. Dr...

01:44:28.561 --> 01:44:29.479
Mrs. Woodhouse?

01:44:29.562 --> 01:44:30.522
Yes!

01:44:30.605 --> 01:44:33.483
Oh, thank you,
Thank you for calling me.

01:44:33.566 --> 01:44:34.984
Thought you were
in California.

01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:38.488
No. No, I've been
to another doctor,

01:44:38.571 --> 01:44:40.990
and he isn't good,
Dr. Hill.

01:44:41.074 --> 01:44:42.992
He's been lying to me

01:44:43.076 --> 01:44:46.996
and giving me unusual kinds
of drinks and capsules.

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.998
The baby's due
on Tuesday.

01:44:49.082 --> 01:44:50.500
Remember you told me
June 28th?

01:44:50.583 --> 01:44:52.502
Well, I want you
to deliver it.

01:44:52.585 --> 01:44:54.003
Mrs. Woodhouse...

01:44:54.087 --> 01:44:56.005
Please let me
talk to you.

01:44:56.089 --> 01:44:59.008
Let me come and explain
what's been going on.

01:44:59.092 --> 01:45:01.010
I can't stay too long here.

01:45:01.094 --> 01:45:03.513
They'll be coming,
looking for me.

01:45:03.596 --> 01:45:04.514
Dr. Hill?

01:45:04.597 --> 01:45:06.516
Dr. Hill,
there's a plot--

01:45:06.599 --> 01:45:08.518
I know that sounds crazy.

01:45:08.601 --> 01:45:10.019
You're probably thinking,

01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:11.980
"My God, this poor girl
has really flipped,"

01:45:12.021 --> 01:45:14.983
but I haven't flipped,
Dr. Hill, I swear.

01:45:15.024 --> 01:45:16.734
By all the saints,
I haven't.

01:45:16.818 --> 01:45:19.279
There are plots against people,
aren't there?

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:20.780
Yes, I suppose there are.

01:45:20.822 --> 01:45:24.284
Well, then there's one against me
and my baby.

01:45:25.869 --> 01:45:28.454
Come to my office
tomorrow after 5:00.

01:45:28.496 --> 01:45:29.455
No!

01:45:29.497 --> 01:45:30.498
Right now.

01:45:31.374 --> 01:45:33.251
Mrs. Woodhouse,
I'm not at my office now.

01:45:33.334 --> 01:45:35.253
I'm home. I've been up
since yesterday morning.

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:36.754
I beg you.

01:45:36.796 --> 01:45:38.256
I beg you.

01:45:39.549 --> 01:45:42.010
I can't stay here.

01:45:42.844 --> 01:45:45.805
My office at 8:00.
-Yes, thank you.

01:45:45.847 --> 01:45:46.973
Oh, wait! Dr. Hill?

01:45:47.015 --> 01:45:47.974
Yes?

01:45:48.016 --> 01:45:50.477
My husband may call you,
asking--

01:45:50.518 --> 01:45:53.480
I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
I'm gonna take a nap.

01:45:53.521 --> 01:45:54.481
Thank you.

01:46:28.389 --> 01:46:30.016
Keep the change.

01:46:30.058 --> 01:46:32.268
Uh, driver, please,

01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:36.940
could you wait and watch until--
until I'm inside the door?

01:46:52.497 --> 01:46:53.832
He lied to you.

01:46:53.832 --> 01:46:55.750
He said we were
going to Hollywood.

01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:56.793
The worst thing of all,

01:46:56.876 --> 01:46:58.336
he's involved
with them as well.

01:46:59.254 --> 01:47:00.755
He sleeps in pajamas now.

01:47:00.797 --> 01:47:02.132
He never used to before.

01:47:02.173 --> 01:47:03.925
He's probably
hiding a mark.

01:47:04.008 --> 01:47:06.136
You know they give you marks
when you join--

01:47:06.219 --> 01:47:07.846
All sorts of rituals.

01:47:07.929 --> 01:47:09.722
They hold sabbaths there.

01:47:09.806 --> 01:47:11.683
You could hear them singing
through the wall.

01:47:11.766 --> 01:47:14.853
Guy, my husband Guy
said it was Dr. Shand,

01:47:14.936 --> 01:47:17.063
one of these people
playing a recorder.

01:47:17.147 --> 01:47:19.774
Now, how did he know
it was Dr. Shand

01:47:19.858 --> 01:47:22.193
unless he was there
with them?

01:47:22.235 --> 01:47:25.363
Um, they're very clever people.

01:47:25.446 --> 01:47:27.532
They planned everything right
from the beginning.

01:47:27.615 --> 01:47:30.535
They probably made
some sort of deal with Guy.

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:34.289
They gave him success,
and he promised them our baby

01:47:34.372 --> 01:47:36.708
to use in their rituals.

01:47:36.791 --> 01:47:38.418
I know
this sounds crazy,

01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:42.130
but I've--I've got books here.
Look.

01:47:43.214 --> 01:47:46.801
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart,

01:47:46.843 --> 01:47:48.553
and they put
a spell on him.

01:47:48.595 --> 01:47:51.014
They cast a spell on him
and made him blind

01:47:51.097 --> 01:47:53.016
so that Guy
could get his part.

01:47:53.099 --> 01:47:55.059
Look, here.

01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:59.439
I had this friend
Edward Hutchins.

01:47:59.522 --> 01:48:01.274
Maybe you heard of him,
a writer.

01:48:01.357 --> 01:48:02.859
He wrote stories
for boys.

01:48:02.942 --> 01:48:04.360
Anyway, he was my good friend

01:48:04.444 --> 01:48:05.820
since I first came
to New York.

01:48:05.904 --> 01:48:07.197
May I keep this?

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:10.867
Yes, please,
and, look, anyway,

01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:13.786
once Mr. Hutchins
came to visit me--

01:48:13.828 --> 01:48:17.916
Came to visit me. It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.

01:48:17.999 --> 01:48:22.045
I was suffering so-- You can't
imagine how much I was suffering,

01:48:22.086 --> 01:48:24.005
and they wouldn't help me.
Nobody would.

01:48:24.047 --> 01:48:27.425
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it.

01:48:27.509 --> 01:48:30.595
Also witches' stuff,
tannis root.

01:48:30.678 --> 01:48:33.807
Hutch came, and he immediately saw
something was wrong.

01:48:33.848 --> 01:48:35.767
He--He knew about witches,
you see.

01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:38.812
Suddenly, Guy rushed in with his makeup
still on,

01:48:38.853 --> 01:48:40.021
which he never did.

01:48:40.104 --> 01:48:42.649
They probably
called him to come home

01:48:42.732 --> 01:48:44.609
and steal one of
Hutch's belongings,

01:48:44.692 --> 01:48:46.528
which he did.
Took his glove,

01:48:46.611 --> 01:48:48.571
and they put a spell
on him, too.

01:48:48.655 --> 01:48:52.992
Put him in a coma.
Three months later, he died.

01:48:53.034 --> 01:48:55.537
Now, maybe all of this
is coincidence,

01:48:55.578 --> 01:48:56.913
but one thing
is for sure.

01:48:56.996 --> 01:48:59.165
They have a coven
and they want my baby.

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:04.504
Certainly seems that way.

01:49:14.556 --> 01:49:16.891
I was afraid you
wouldn't believe me.

01:49:16.975 --> 01:49:18.560
I don't believe
in witchcraft,

01:49:18.643 --> 01:49:22.230
but there are plenty of maniacs
and crazy people in this city.

01:49:22.313 --> 01:49:23.982
The doctor's name is Shand,
you say?

01:49:24.065 --> 01:49:27.443
N-No, Dr. Shand is
one of these people.

01:49:27.527 --> 01:49:29.529
The doctor's name
is Sapirstein.

01:49:30.446 --> 01:49:32.699
Abraham Sapirstein?

01:49:33.032 --> 01:49:35.493
Yeah.

01:49:35.577 --> 01:49:36.744
Do you know him?

01:49:36.786 --> 01:49:39.038
I've met him once or twice.

01:49:39.122 --> 01:49:40.874
To look at him,
you'd never think he--

01:49:40.915 --> 01:49:43.626
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.

01:49:44.335 --> 01:49:46.254
Would you like to go
into Mount Sinai right now,

01:49:46.296 --> 01:49:47.922
this evening?

01:49:48.006 --> 01:49:51.551
Yeah, I would love to.
Would that be possible?

01:49:51.634 --> 01:49:53.887
It's difficult,
but we'll try.

01:49:54.637 --> 01:49:57.432
I want you to lie down
and get some rest.

01:49:57.474 --> 01:49:58.475
Yes.

01:49:58.558 --> 01:50:01.811
Anything they've got,
even a broom closet'd be fine.

01:50:01.895 --> 01:50:04.314
I hope we can
do better than that.

01:50:10.278 --> 01:50:14.115
I'll see what I can do,
then I'll check you over.

01:50:16.326 --> 01:50:17.702
Oh, should I undress now?

01:50:17.785 --> 01:50:20.497
No. It'll take me about
a half-hour on the telephone.

01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:22.624
You just lie down, rest.

01:50:24.626 --> 01:50:25.543
O.K.?

01:50:25.627 --> 01:50:26.711
O.K.

01:50:35.136 --> 01:50:37.430
God bless Dr. Hill.

01:50:43.353 --> 01:50:46.981
Everything's going to be O.K. now,
Andy or Jenny.

01:50:47.065 --> 01:50:50.443
We're going to be in a nice,
clean hospital

01:50:50.485 --> 01:50:52.445
with no visitors.

01:50:54.989 --> 01:50:56.074
Oh.

01:51:13.508 --> 01:51:15.260
Monsters.

01:51:18.096 --> 01:51:19.389
Monsters.

01:51:23.017 --> 01:51:25.478
Unspeakable.

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.313
Unspeakable.

01:51:58.887 --> 01:52:00.680
I was sleeping.

01:52:14.903 --> 01:52:17.280
Come with us quietly,
Rosemary.

01:52:17.363 --> 01:52:19.407
Don't argue or make a scene

01:52:19.491 --> 01:52:21.910
because if you say anything more about
witches or witchcraft,

01:52:21.951 --> 01:52:24.370
we're going to be forced to take you
to a mental hospital.

01:52:24.454 --> 01:52:26.498
You don't want that,
do you?

01:52:26.581 --> 01:52:27.749
So put your shoes on.

01:52:27.832 --> 01:52:30.168
Wejust want
to take you home.

01:52:30.251 --> 01:52:31.377
No one's going
to hurt you.

01:52:31.419 --> 01:52:34.881
Or the baby.
Put your shoes on.

01:52:52.816 --> 01:52:54.234
She's fine now.

01:52:54.609 --> 01:52:56.611
We're going to go home and rest.

01:52:56.694 --> 01:52:57.946
That's all it takes.

01:52:58.029 --> 01:52:59.447
Thank you for your trouble,
Doctor.

01:52:59.489 --> 01:53:01.157
Glad I could be of help, sir.

01:53:01.199 --> 01:53:03.159
It's a shame you had to come in here.

01:53:56.421 --> 01:53:58.423
Good evening,
Mrs. Woodhouse.

01:54:13.938 --> 01:54:15.899
Mrs. Woodhouse!

01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:17.901
Mrs. Woodhouse!

01:54:42.967 --> 01:54:43.968
Uhh!

01:55:22.090 --> 01:55:23.133
Ro!

01:55:23.216 --> 01:55:24.592
Ro!

01:55:24.634 --> 01:55:25.927
Ro!

01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:29.264
Ro, baby, Ro!

01:55:29.305 --> 01:55:30.515
Ro!

01:55:33.768 --> 01:55:34.894
Come on, open up, Ro.

01:55:34.936 --> 01:55:36.020
Go to hell!

01:55:36.104 --> 01:55:37.063
Come on, honey.
No one's going to hurt you.

01:55:37.147 --> 01:55:39.399
You promised them the baby,
get out!

01:55:39.482 --> 01:55:40.817
No, I didn't promise
them anything.

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:41.860
What are you talking about?
Promised who?

01:55:41.943 --> 01:55:42.861
Rosemary, you're--

01:55:42.944 --> 01:55:45.238
You, too! Get away!

01:56:17.228 --> 01:56:18.188
Hello.

01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.938
Elise?

01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:19.981
Mrs. Dunstan is out.

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:21.816
-Who is this?
-The babysitter.

01:56:21.858 --> 01:56:22.817
Do you know
where she went?

01:56:22.859 --> 01:56:24.110
They went
to the movies.

01:56:24.736 --> 01:56:27.572
This is Rosemary.
Please ask her to call Rosemary

01:56:27.614 --> 01:56:29.073
the second
she gets home.

01:56:29.115 --> 01:56:32.160
It's terribly urgent.
Don't-- Don't forget.

01:56:32.243 --> 01:56:33.828
Don't worry.
I'll tell her.

01:56:33.912 --> 01:56:35.079
Thank you.

01:56:41.961 --> 01:56:43.421
We don't want
to hurt you, Ro.

01:56:45.215 --> 01:56:46.841
We're your friends,
Rosemary.

01:56:46.925 --> 01:56:48.551
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Rosemary.

01:56:48.635 --> 01:56:50.178
Honest and truly there isn't.

01:56:50.261 --> 01:56:53.431
This is nothing but a mild sedative
to calm you down.

01:56:53.515 --> 01:56:55.892
You know I wouldn't
let any--

01:56:55.975 --> 01:56:56.935
Ro.

01:56:57.018 --> 01:56:57.936
Aah!

01:56:58.019 --> 01:56:59.437
Ro, Ro!

01:56:59.521 --> 01:57:00.647
Help me!

01:57:00.730 --> 01:57:01.648
Oh, Ro, baby.

01:57:01.731 --> 01:57:04.692
Somebody help me!

01:57:04.776 --> 01:57:05.777
Aah!

01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:16.538
Wait a minute.

01:57:17.455 --> 01:57:19.666
Wait a minute now.

01:57:24.879 --> 01:57:26.714
We happen to be
in labor here.

01:57:26.756 --> 01:57:27.715
Here?

01:57:27.757 --> 01:57:28.299
Here.

01:57:28.383 --> 01:57:29.467
You're all right, baby.

01:57:29.551 --> 01:57:30.969
You're going to be
perfectly all right.

01:57:31.052 --> 01:57:32.095
I swear to God you will.

01:57:32.178 --> 01:57:34.848
There were supposed
to be doctors, hospitals!

01:57:34.889 --> 01:57:35.849
Doctors, hospitals!

01:57:37.016 --> 01:57:40.353
Everything--
Everything's clean and sterile!

01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:42.981
No, she isn't here, Elise.

01:57:43.064 --> 01:57:45.024
I'll have her
call you back.

01:57:50.822 --> 01:57:52.282
Oh, Andy...

01:57:52.365 --> 01:57:54.993
Andy or Jenny...

01:57:55.076 --> 01:57:59.038
I--I'm sorry,
my little darling.

01:57:59.122 --> 01:58:00.748
Forgive me.

01:58:11.843 --> 01:58:13.303
Hi.

01:58:18.475 --> 01:58:19.601
Hi.

01:58:21.603 --> 01:58:24.814
Is it all right?

01:58:25.607 --> 01:58:29.110
Yes, it's fine.

01:58:30.612 --> 01:58:32.989
What is it?

01:58:33.072 --> 01:58:34.616
A boy.

01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:41.706
Really?
A boy?

01:58:51.049 --> 01:58:53.051
And it's all right?

01:58:53.134 --> 01:58:54.803
Yes.

01:59:14.405 --> 01:59:16.366
Where is it?

01:59:16.449 --> 01:59:17.450
Ohh!

01:59:17.534 --> 01:59:19.035
Oh, my goodness.

01:59:19.077 --> 01:59:21.788
Oh, gee, what a start you gave me.
My goodness.

01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:23.206
The baby, where is it?

01:59:23.289 --> 01:59:26.793
Oh, uh, you wait
here one minute.

01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:30.547
Where's my baby?

01:59:30.630 --> 01:59:33.091
Uh, I'll go find Dr. Abe.

01:59:33.133 --> 01:59:34.634
Ju-Just wait.

01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:52.527
Where's the baby?

01:59:56.114 --> 01:59:57.615
Where is it?

01:59:57.657 --> 01:59:59.826
Honey...

02:00:00.368 --> 02:00:01.703
There were complications,
Rosemary,

02:00:01.744 --> 02:00:03.663
but nothing that will affect
future births.

02:00:07.083 --> 02:00:08.793
It's...

02:00:10.170 --> 02:00:11.296
Dead.

02:00:11.379 --> 02:00:12.797
It was in
the wrong position.

02:00:12.881 --> 02:00:14.299
In the hospital
I might have been able

02:00:14.382 --> 02:00:15.925
to do something about it,
but you wouldn't listen.

02:00:16.009 --> 02:00:18.970
Honey, we can have others
as soon as you're better. I promise you.

02:00:19.053 --> 02:00:21.639
Absolutely. You can start on another
in a very few months.

02:00:21.723 --> 02:00:23.057
As soon as
you're better.

02:00:23.099 --> 02:00:24.267
No.

02:00:25.977 --> 02:00:28.438
I don't believe you.
You're both lying.

02:00:28.521 --> 02:00:30.523
You're lying!
It didn't die!

02:00:30.565 --> 02:00:31.649
You took it!

02:00:31.733 --> 02:00:32.984
You're lying!

02:00:33.067 --> 02:00:34.694
You're witches!

02:00:34.777 --> 02:00:35.778
You're lying!

02:00:35.862 --> 02:00:37.322
You're lying!

02:00:37.405 --> 02:00:39.324
You're lying!

02:00:39.407 --> 02:00:41.075
You're lying!

02:00:49.751 --> 02:00:53.254
Abe says it's called
pre-partum.

02:00:53.338 --> 02:00:56.216
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.

02:00:57.175 --> 02:01:01.095
Boy, you were really kapow,
out of your mind.

02:01:03.515 --> 02:01:08.853
Uh, I know where you got the idea
that Minnie and Roman were witches,

02:01:09.437 --> 02:01:14.609
but, um, how come you thought
that Abe and I joined the party?

02:01:17.445 --> 02:01:20.949
Um, let's face it, darling.

02:01:19.531 --> 02:01:23.910
You had the pre-partum crazies.

02:01:24.452 --> 02:01:28.832
Now you're going to rest,
and you're going to get over them.

02:01:28.915 --> 02:01:32.585
I know this is the worst thing
that ever happened to you,

02:01:32.669 --> 02:01:35.004
but from now on,
everything's going to be roses.

02:01:35.088 --> 02:01:37.048
Paramount's within an inch
of where we want them,

02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:39.342
and suddenly Universal's
interested, too,

02:01:39.425 --> 02:01:40.677
and we're going
to blow this town,

02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:42.887
and we're going to be
in the beautiful Hills of Beverly

02:01:42.971 --> 02:01:46.391
with a pool, a spice garden,
the whole schmeer,

02:01:46.432 --> 02:01:48.101
and the kids, too, Ro.

02:01:48.184 --> 02:01:51.104
Scout's honor.
You heard what Abe said.

02:01:54.941 --> 02:01:57.819
Now, I got to run now
and get famous.

02:02:00.655 --> 02:02:03.116
Let me see your shoulder.

02:02:06.035 --> 02:02:07.871
Let me see your shoulder.

02:02:07.954 --> 02:02:08.955
Are you kidding?

02:02:09.038 --> 02:02:11.833
Your left shoulder.

02:02:11.916 --> 02:02:14.294
All right.
Anything you say.

02:02:17.338 --> 02:02:20.675
I generally prefer
doing this to music.

02:02:20.758 --> 02:02:22.260
Left shoulder.

02:02:25.305 --> 02:02:26.389
Right shoulder.

02:02:29.684 --> 02:02:33.605
And that's as far as I go
without a blue light.

02:02:37.609 --> 02:02:39.486
The high pressure area
that we see here

02:02:39.569 --> 02:02:41.946
has been causing this
extreme heat and humidity.

02:02:42.572 --> 02:02:45.200
And unfortunately
will be staying with us city dwellers

02:02:45.283 --> 02:02:46.826
through the rest of the week.

02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:50.038
It will be hot and over cast
upstate New York as well

02:02:50.121 --> 02:02:53.541
with the possibility of thunder showers
tonight and tomorrow

02:02:53.625 --> 02:02:56.085
withg radual clearing
by tomorrow night.

02:02:56.127 --> 02:03:00.590
All you people leaving the city this
upcoming weekend should find it hot.

02:03:24.614 --> 02:03:28.159
Do you hear a baby crying?

02:03:28.243 --> 02:03:30.703
Why, no, I don't, dear.

02:03:30.787 --> 02:03:32.580
Now, you come
and get into your bed now.

02:03:32.622 --> 02:03:35.542
It's time for you
to take your pill.

02:03:44.801 --> 02:03:46.761
Did you turn the air
conditioner off?

02:03:46.803 --> 02:03:47.595
Mm-hmm.

02:03:47.637 --> 02:03:49.681
Well, you mustn't do that, dear.

02:03:49.764 --> 02:03:52.725
Why, people are actually dying,
it's so hot.

02:04:07.866 --> 02:04:09.576
What do you do
with the milk?

02:04:10.076 --> 02:04:12.871
Why, uh,
throw it away.

02:04:12.954 --> 02:04:14.622
Your pill, Rosemary.

02:04:24.007 --> 02:04:25.341
Hello, girls.

02:04:25.425 --> 02:04:28.928
Whew. 95 out.

02:04:29.012 --> 02:04:32.307
Some new people
moved on in up in 8.

02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:34.726
Do they have a baby?

02:04:36.603 --> 02:04:37.979
How'd you know that?

02:04:38.062 --> 02:04:41.107
I heard it crying.

02:04:42.442 --> 02:04:43.902
Oh, wait a minute.

02:04:47.322 --> 02:04:50.116
Oh, no.
Don't do that.

02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:51.743
Why not?

02:04:51.826 --> 02:04:55.288
Uh, a little messy, that's all.

02:07:45.250 --> 02:07:47.210
Easy, easy.

02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:07.105
Got her too high.

02:08:26.583 --> 02:08:29.878
Not if he's still waiting
for a plane, he isn't.

02:08:32.547 --> 02:08:34.299
Oh, hell, now, Hayato.

02:08:34.382 --> 02:08:35.675
You're just
making fun of me.

02:08:35.717 --> 02:08:38.386
You're pulling my leg,
like we say.

02:09:03.536 --> 02:09:06.664
Aah!

02:09:07.373 --> 02:09:09.626
Rosemary,
go back to bed.

02:09:09.751 --> 02:09:12.128
You know you're not supposed
to be up and around.

02:09:12.170 --> 02:09:13.129
Is the mother?

02:09:13.213 --> 02:09:14.339
Uh, Rosemary--

02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:17.842
Shut up. You're in Dubrovnik.
I don't hear you.

02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:05.390
What have you
done to it?

02:10:05.431 --> 02:10:07.559
What have you done
to its eyes?

02:10:07.642 --> 02:10:09.144
He has his
father's eyes.

02:10:14.482 --> 02:10:18.111
What are you talking about?
Guy's eyes are normal.

02:10:18.153 --> 02:10:21.281
What have you done to him,
you maniacs?

02:10:21.322 --> 02:10:23.783
Satan is his father,
not Guy.

02:10:24.534 --> 02:10:28.163
He came up from hell and begat a son
of mortal woman.

02:10:28.204 --> 02:10:29.122
Hail, Satan.

02:10:29.205 --> 02:10:30.206
Hail, Satan.

02:10:30.290 --> 02:10:33.710
Satan is his father,
and his name is Adrian.

02:10:33.793 --> 02:10:37.046
He shall overthrow the mighty
and lay waste their temples.

02:10:37.130 --> 02:10:40.467
He shall redeem the despised
and wreak vengeance

02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:44.012
in the name of the burned
and the tortured!

02:10:44.053 --> 02:10:45.013
Hail, Adrian!

02:10:45.054 --> 02:10:46.014
Hail, Adrian!

02:10:46.055 --> 02:10:48.141
Hail, Satan!
Hail, Satan!

02:10:48.224 --> 02:10:49.893
Hail, Satan!

02:10:49.976 --> 02:10:51.811
He chose you
out of all the world.

02:10:51.895 --> 02:10:54.314
Out of all the women
in the whole world, he chose you.

02:10:54.397 --> 02:10:56.107
He arranged things
because he wanted you

02:10:56.191 --> 02:10:57.609
to be the mother
of his only living son.

02:10:57.692 --> 02:11:00.028
His power is stronger
than stronger!

02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:02.822
His might shall last
longer than longer!

02:11:02.906 --> 02:11:04.741
Hail, Satan!

02:11:05.283 --> 02:11:07.035
No!

02:11:07.076 --> 02:11:09.871
It can't be!

02:11:09.954 --> 02:11:11.748
No!

02:11:11.831 --> 02:11:13.249
Go look at his hands.

02:11:13.333 --> 02:11:14.709
And his feet.

02:11:16.711 --> 02:11:19.088
Oh, God!

02:11:20.173 --> 02:11:22.050
God is dead!

02:11:22.091 --> 02:11:23.426
Satan lives!

02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:25.303
The year is one!

02:11:25.345 --> 02:11:26.554
- Hail, Satan!
- Hail, Satan!

02:11:26.638 --> 02:11:28.348
The year is one,
and God is done!

02:11:28.431 --> 02:11:29.516
Oh, God!

02:11:29.599 --> 02:11:31.142
The year is one!

02:11:31.184 --> 02:11:33.895
Hail, Adrian!

02:11:33.978 --> 02:11:36.439
Hail, Satan!

02:11:36.815 --> 02:11:38.691
Why don't you help us out,
Rosemary?

02:11:39.818 --> 02:11:42.070
Be a real mother to Adrian.

02:11:41.319 --> 02:11:43.446
You don't have to join
If you don't want to.

02:11:43.488 --> 02:11:46.658
Just be a mother
to your baby.

02:11:47.492 --> 02:11:51.079
Minnie and Laura-Louise
are too old.

02:11:51.162 --> 02:11:52.705
It's not right.

02:11:54.833 --> 02:11:56.626
Think about it, Rosemary.

02:12:10.348 --> 02:12:11.891
Oh, God!

02:12:11.975 --> 02:12:13.351
Oh, shut up with your oh, Gods,

02:12:13.393 --> 02:12:14.811
or we'll kill you,
milk or no milk.

02:12:14.853 --> 02:12:15.979
You shut up.

02:12:16.062 --> 02:12:20.066
Rosemary's his mother,
so you show some respect.

02:12:21.359 --> 02:12:22.777
Come, my friend.

02:12:22.861 --> 02:12:25.613
Come see him.
Come see the child.

02:12:35.748 --> 02:12:38.835
What would you
like to drink?

02:12:38.877 --> 02:12:41.379
They, uh, promised
me you wouldn't be hurt,

02:12:41.421 --> 02:12:44.090
and you haven't
been, really.

02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:49.554
I mean, supposing you had the baby
and you lost it.

02:12:49.637 --> 02:12:51.598
Wouldn't that
be the same?

02:12:51.639 --> 02:12:54.726
And we're getting so much
in return, Ro.

02:13:05.069 --> 02:13:09.574
Oh, Guy, let me introduce
you to Argyron Stavropoulos.

02:13:09.616 --> 02:13:12.202
How proud you must be.

02:13:12.285 --> 02:13:13.745
Is this the mother?

02:13:13.787 --> 02:13:14.954
Why in the name of--

02:13:14.996 --> 02:13:17.040
Here, drink this.
You'll feel a little better.

02:13:17.123 --> 02:13:18.583
What's in it?
Tannis root?

02:13:18.666 --> 02:13:19.584
Nothing's in it.

02:13:19.667 --> 02:13:21.377
Just plain,
ordinary Lipton's tea.

02:13:21.461 --> 02:13:22.879
You drink it.

02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:55.620
Get away from here.

02:13:55.703 --> 02:13:56.871
Roman.

02:13:56.955 --> 02:13:58.957
You're rocking him too fast.

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:00.875
Sit down.
Get her out of here.

02:14:00.875 --> 02:14:02.127
Put her where she belongs.

02:14:02.210 --> 02:14:03.795
You're rocking him too fast.

02:14:03.878 --> 02:14:04.879
That's why he's crying.

02:14:05.004 --> 02:14:05.839
Oh, mind your own business.

02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:07.132
Let Rosemary rock him.

02:14:08.216 --> 02:14:10.802
Go on, sit down with the others.
Let Rosemary rock him.

02:14:10.844 --> 02:14:11.886
Well, she's liable to--

02:14:11.970 --> 02:14:14.889
Sit down with the others,
Laura-Louise.

02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:25.441
Rock him.

02:14:28.194 --> 02:14:31.489
You're trying to get me
to be his mother.

02:14:31.573 --> 02:14:33.575
Aren't you his mother?

02:16:41.411 --> 02:16:41.577
