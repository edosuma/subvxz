WEBVTT

00:01.948 --> 00:05.063
- <i>Previously on</i> Gotham...
- Watch out! (screams)

00:05.113 --> 00:06.180
SELINA: <i>Ivy's missing.</i>

00:06.248 --> 00:07.214
She'll turn up somewhere.

00:07.282 --> 00:09.450
It was a long way down into water.

00:09.518 --> 00:11.318
MARV: What's your name? My name's Ivy.

00:12.767 --> 00:14.188
- Who the hell are you?
- Not yet.

00:14.256 --> 00:15.923
This is too fun.

00:15.991 --> 00:18.826
ISABELLA: <i>He loves me and I love him.</i>

00:18.894 --> 00:20.261
OSWALD: <i>I am telling you one last time,</i>

00:20.328 --> 00:23.163
let Ed go.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.598
- No.
- Very well.

00:24.666 --> 00:25.933
<i>Don't say I didn't warn you.</i>

00:26.001 --> 00:27.401
Oh, no.

00:28.770 --> 00:30.905
(screaming): Somebody help!

00:30.972 --> 00:32.573
I want to rejoin the GCPD.

00:32.641 --> 00:34.808
Welcome back, Detective.

00:34.876 --> 00:36.143
Captain, I'm so glad you came.

00:36.211 --> 00:38.178
I came to congratulate you.

00:38.246 --> 00:41.682
ALICE: <i>If a person comes into contact
with my blood, it changes them.</i>

00:41.750 --> 00:43.183
BARNES: <i>You and I are gonna
make a difference in this city.</i>

00:43.251 --> 00:44.251
<i>We're gonna clean it up.</i>

00:44.319 --> 00:46.387
(screaming)

00:49.090 --> 00:51.325
<i>Sentence served.</i>

00:51.393 --> 00:53.994
Symon. (groaning)

00:54.062 --> 00:55.129
Who did this?

00:55.196 --> 00:56.964
Barnes.

01:01.202 --> 01:03.671
(indistinct chatter)

01:03.738 --> 01:05.438
CAMPOS: So, seems anyone
could have gotten access

01:05.507 --> 01:06.707
to that bathroom, not just the guests.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.075
Suspect pool's wide open.

01:08.143 --> 01:09.143
All right, start with statements

01:09.210 --> 01:10.578
from everyone at the party.

01:10.645 --> 01:12.276
Someone saw Symon go into that bathroom.

01:12.338 --> 01:13.604
Okay.

01:16.684 --> 01:17.985
I still can't believe it.

01:18.052 --> 01:20.320
I'm sorry things went down this way.

01:20.388 --> 01:21.822
Don't apologize; you were right.

01:21.890 --> 01:23.857
Did you give your statement already?

01:23.925 --> 01:25.492
I'm afraid I wasn't very helpful.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.928
Till about an hour ago,
I couldn't pick Symon

01:27.996 --> 01:29.029
out of a crowd.

01:29.097 --> 01:31.465
Did you talk to Barnes at the party?

01:31.533 --> 01:34.701
A little. We had a drink.

01:34.769 --> 01:37.237
Symon died around 10:30.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.705
The attack happened just before.

01:38.773 --> 01:40.140
What time did you talk with Barnes?

01:40.208 --> 01:41.375
9:00.

01:41.442 --> 01:43.844
What is this about?

01:45.146 --> 01:47.748
- (sighs) Nothing.
- Nothing? Really?

01:47.816 --> 01:49.483
I can't talk about it.

01:49.551 --> 01:51.451
No.

01:51.519 --> 01:52.853
Lee, I cannot talk about it.

01:52.921 --> 01:55.055
Jim, I hope you know what you're doing.

01:55.123 --> 01:57.324
Me, too.

01:57.392 --> 01:58.892
Barnes? No. No, no, no, no, no.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.394
I asked Symon who attacked him,

02:00.461 --> 02:01.695
and he said Barnes.

02:01.763 --> 02:03.363
Symon was a psychopath

02:03.431 --> 02:05.365
who gave face transplants to the mob

02:05.433 --> 02:06.733
using stolen faces.

02:06.801 --> 02:08.134
Hardly a credible witness.

02:08.203 --> 02:09.269
And this guy, Barnes?

02:09.336 --> 02:10.770
If he so much as jaywalked,

02:10.839 --> 02:13.140
- he would write himself a ticket.
- I know.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.209
"And now you're saying
he went to Lee Thompkin"

02:15.276 --> 02:17.778
engagement party, and out of
nowhere, busted some guy's face

02:17.846 --> 02:20.147
and chucked him through a wall?
- I know, Harvey.

02:20.215 --> 02:22.783
- What's the motive?
- I don't know, maybe he...

02:22.851 --> 02:24.151
He saw Symon,

02:24.219 --> 02:25.252
he got pissed he was released,

02:25.320 --> 02:26.787
and he lost control.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.488
Okay. So, you're saying

02:28.556 --> 02:30.691
that a man with a
spotless 20-year career,

02:30.758 --> 02:32.759
just went ape. Is-is that your theory?

02:32.827 --> 02:34.761
Something's been off about him recently.

02:34.829 --> 02:37.064
You yourself said he
nearly beat Tetch to death.

02:37.131 --> 02:39.733
And what's with him
insisting on running point

02:39.801 --> 02:41.335
- in the Paulie Pennies case?
- Look,

02:41.402 --> 02:43.537
I don't know, but that
does not make him a killer.

02:43.605 --> 02:45.472
So where is he now?

02:45.540 --> 02:47.708
Home. He spent the
better part of yesterday

02:47.775 --> 02:50.010
chasing down Symon, maybe he's tired.

02:50.078 --> 02:51.778
That doesn't mean he's guilty.

02:51.846 --> 02:55.115
The last thing I want is
for Barnes to be guilty.

02:55.183 --> 02:56.316
I look up to the man.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.019
But if there is even a
chance then we have to know.

02:59.087 --> 03:00.954
And something doesn't feel right.

03:01.022 --> 03:04.057
Okay, okay, okay. I'm gonna help you.

03:04.125 --> 03:06.360
But just so you know,
I'm doing it to prove

03:06.427 --> 03:08.061
he's innocent, not guilty.

03:08.129 --> 03:09.997
That's fine. All right, so
I'll go back to the scene,

03:10.064 --> 03:12.699
see if forensics can pull
some prints from the bathroom.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.635
Barnes's should already be on file.

03:14.702 --> 03:17.771
Jim. I know how to do my job.

03:19.307 --> 03:21.208
I hope I'm wrong.

03:21.276 --> 03:24.611
Yeah. Me, too.

03:29.784 --> 03:32.519
(sirens wailing in distance)

03:32.587 --> 03:34.554
(grunting)

03:34.622 --> 03:37.024
(foghorn blowing)

03:37.091 --> 03:40.127
It starts as a whisper.

03:40.194 --> 03:42.095
You have to strain to hear it.

03:42.163 --> 03:43.797
(muffled whimpering)

03:43.865 --> 03:48.201
And then it grows louder and louder,

03:48.269 --> 03:51.605
till it becomes a roar.

03:51.673 --> 03:55.509
It's everything you can
do to just shut it out.

03:57.178 --> 03:58.712
And just like that...

03:58.780 --> 04:01.682
you suddenly realize it's <i>your</i> voice.

04:01.749 --> 04:04.451
The one you've been denying.

04:04.519 --> 04:06.386
Telling you who you are.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.190
What you have to do.

04:10.258 --> 04:12.426
And then you stop fighting.

04:14.729 --> 04:16.897
And this calm comes over you.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.665
(muffled groaning)

04:23.638 --> 04:26.106
(whimpering and groaning continue)

04:28.343 --> 04:30.644
Sex trafficking.

04:31.913 --> 04:33.513
Drugs.

04:34.415 --> 04:36.216
Murder.

04:36.284 --> 04:40.320
I've kept files on all
three of you for years.

04:40.388 --> 04:42.089
Waiting for the proof we needed

04:42.156 --> 04:44.825
while you sneered at the law.

04:44.892 --> 04:46.460
Not tonight.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.430
Tonight, I <i>am</i> the law!

04:52.767 --> 04:55.202
And you are hereby tried.

04:55.269 --> 04:57.904
(crunches, groaning)

04:57.972 --> 04:59.806
Found guilty.

05:02.410 --> 05:04.745
And sentenced.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.558
So what's an antiquities dealer?

05:26.626 --> 05:30.495
I buy and sell rare
and beautiful objects.

05:31.764 --> 05:35.233
I like to think I have
an eye for beauty.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.237
Is this a bug?

05:39.305 --> 05:40.839
An Egyptian scarab.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.441
More than 3,000 years old.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.122
It's priceless.

05:45.718 --> 05:47.232
Everything has a price.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.047
What's upstairs?

05:49.115 --> 05:50.849
The bedroom.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.384
Hmm.

05:52.451 --> 05:53.920
And the vault.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.022
Vault?

05:57.089 --> 06:00.692
It's where I keep my most
valuable acquisitions.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.594
Can I see?

06:02.662 --> 06:04.196
(chuckles) Ivy,

06:04.263 --> 06:07.165
you are very beautiful.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.201
But we've only just met.

06:09.268 --> 06:12.304
We haven't had time to
get to know each other.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.005
Who are you?

06:14.073 --> 06:15.941
Where do you come from?

06:16.008 --> 06:17.776
What do you do?

06:17.843 --> 06:20.378
Well, I'm from Gotham.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.280
And I meet men.

06:22.348 --> 06:24.082
Like you.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.350
They give me things.

06:25.418 --> 06:29.187
(chuckles) And what do you give them?

06:29.255 --> 06:31.223
Nothing.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.674
I also like plants.

06:34.418 --> 06:37.095
I've always been able to
get them to grow for me.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.568
Lately, I've been using
them to make perfume.

06:39.878 --> 06:42.701
Plants are so much more
powerful than people imagine.

06:42.768 --> 06:45.403
They can poison you, heal you,

06:46.012 --> 06:47.725
make you fall in love.

06:48.296 --> 06:50.842
I made this from a strain
of <i>cananga odorata.</i>

06:53.012 --> 06:54.879
Smell.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.582
(inhales)

06:57.650 --> 06:59.718
(exhales)

06:59.785 --> 07:02.153
(distorted, echoing):
Now, open the vault.

07:04.624 --> 07:08.193
(keypad beeping)

07:08.261 --> 07:09.394
COMPUTERIZED WOMAN'S
VOICE: Access granted.

(grunts)

07:49.935 --> 07:51.536
(gasps)

07:52.705 --> 07:55.540
Did they send you? You lying <i>schlampe!</i>

07:55.608 --> 07:57.075
Did they?

07:57.143 --> 07:58.443
(yowls)

07:58.511 --> 08:00.445
(wheezing)

08:00.513 --> 08:02.714
Come back here!

08:02.782 --> 08:05.617
You hear me? I'll find you!

08:06.519 --> 08:08.520
(birds chirping)

08:16.298 --> 08:17.729
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

08:18.132 --> 08:20.800
You've been checking
your watch all morning.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.002
You expecting... A call from Isabella.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.371
She's at her librarian conference.

08:25.439 --> 08:26.973
Ah.

08:27.041 --> 08:28.841
Probably just busy.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.343
Most likely.

08:30.411 --> 08:32.111
I can imagine librarian conferences

08:32.179 --> 08:34.113
can be hectic affairs.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.349
- Not so much.
- Well,

08:36.417 --> 08:38.551
I'm sure she'll call soon.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.586
(phone ringing)

08:43.557 --> 08:45.158
(clears throat)

08:45.225 --> 08:47.193
Hello.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.030
This is Edward Nygma.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.934
Why?

08:55.836 --> 08:58.304
Very well.

09:02.076 --> 09:04.043
That was the GCPD.

09:04.111 --> 09:08.101
They want to see me. Wouldn't say why.

09:08.597 --> 09:10.012
Oh?

09:12.499 --> 09:14.934
You don't think that
something happened...

09:15.002 --> 09:17.770
No!

09:17.838 --> 09:19.972
(both chuckle nervously)

09:26.780 --> 09:27.947
(gasps)

09:30.183 --> 09:31.884
(exhales)

09:37.991 --> 09:39.992
(whispering indistinctly)

09:44.898 --> 09:47.166
The officer said Isabella
blew through a red light

09:47.234 --> 09:49.569
and crashed into a train.

09:49.636 --> 09:52.605
They think she might've
fallen asleep at the wheel.

09:53.707 --> 09:57.209
Yours was the last number in her phone.

09:57.277 --> 10:01.347
I am... so, so sorry, Ed.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.284
Did she suffer?

10:07.654 --> 10:09.355
No.

10:13.360 --> 10:16.028
Anything you need, Ed,

10:16.096 --> 10:17.830
anything at all,

10:17.898 --> 10:19.665
I am here for you.

10:43.156 --> 10:44.223
SELINA: <i>Breakfast!</i>

10:44.291 --> 10:46.292
(clicking tongue)

10:46.360 --> 10:48.494
(cat meows)

10:48.562 --> 10:50.997
IVY: Still collecting strays?

10:51.064 --> 10:52.665
(chuckles)

10:52.733 --> 10:53.766
Lady,

10:53.834 --> 10:56.268
you got two seconds to get out of here

10:56.336 --> 10:57.937
before I gut you like a fish.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.839
You really don't recognize me?

10:59.906 --> 11:02.475
Selina, it's me.

11:02.542 --> 11:05.478
Ivy? Hey, you got anything

11:05.545 --> 11:07.013
to eat around here?

11:07.080 --> 11:09.682
I'm starving.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.283
(cat mewing)

11:11.351 --> 11:12.852
(phone ringing)

11:12.919 --> 11:14.181
Yeah.

11:14.231 --> 11:16.155
Jim, I'm outside the
scene. Forensics found tons

11:16.223 --> 11:18.758
of prints inside the bathroom
where Symon was attacked.

11:18.825 --> 11:20.159
Barnes?

11:20.227 --> 11:21.527
That just means he was in there.

11:21.595 --> 11:23.195
- It puts him at the scene.
- BULLOCK: Listen,

11:23.263 --> 11:25.665
I've been thinking. You got to
tell Barnes what Symon said.

11:25.732 --> 11:29.001
Give him the right to defend himself.

11:29.069 --> 11:30.970
I will.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.972
When I'm ready.

11:44.384 --> 11:45.751
(door opens)

11:48.288 --> 11:49.722
Help you?

11:49.790 --> 11:51.857
Captain.

11:51.925 --> 11:56.328
I was, uh, looking for
the Paulie Pennies file.

11:56.396 --> 11:59.432
Thinking the cases might be related.

12:06.273 --> 12:08.541
Thanks.

12:11.850 --> 12:12.983
Fill me in.

12:13.051 --> 12:16.086
Nothing hard yet, but we'll get there.

12:16.154 --> 12:17.454
Uh-huh.

12:17.522 --> 12:20.124
I was reading through some
of the witness statements.

12:20.191 --> 12:22.960
The couple from the alley...
They say when they found

12:23.028 --> 12:24.628
Symon, he was still alive.

12:24.696 --> 12:26.997
You were first on the scene.

12:27.072 --> 12:30.134
- Did he say anything to you?
- No.

12:30.201 --> 12:33.003
He didn't ID the killer?

12:34.272 --> 12:37.441
No.

12:37.509 --> 12:40.144
Ah. 'Cause one of the
witnesses seems to think

12:40.211 --> 12:41.812
that you were talking to him.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.848
He tried, sure.

12:43.860 --> 12:45.883
But he couldn't speak. He died

12:45.945 --> 12:47.459
almost right away.

12:47.645 --> 12:49.953
Uh-huh.

12:51.152 --> 12:53.988
Well, for what it's worth, I called

12:54.055 --> 12:57.625
an old C.I. of mine with
deep ties to the mob.

12:59.094 --> 13:00.094
He says that

13:00.161 --> 13:03.497
once I collared Symon,
the higher-ups got jumpy.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.966
You're saying the mob had him killed?

13:06.034 --> 13:08.102
He was giving these guys new faces.

13:08.169 --> 13:10.905
He's probably the only
one who can ID them.

13:10.972 --> 13:14.508
That's a lot to protect. Makes sense.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.810
My C.I. also had a name.
Mid-level enforcer,

13:16.878 --> 13:18.946
goes by "Sugar," works
out of the East End.

13:19.014 --> 13:21.815
- Says he actually did the killing.
- I'll have a team pick him up.

13:21.883 --> 13:24.318
I'd rather you kept this
between us. Mob still has

13:24.386 --> 13:27.354
their fingers in most
of these guys' pockets.

13:27.422 --> 13:30.391
You never know who you can trust. So,

13:30.458 --> 13:32.660
you ready to ride with the old man?

13:32.727 --> 13:34.929
Sure. Just let me run
it by my, uh, partner.

13:34.996 --> 13:36.196
Why bother him?

13:36.264 --> 13:38.565
We'll be there and back
before you know it.

13:42.795 --> 13:44.696
GORDON: <i>So where are we headed?</i>

13:45.373 --> 13:49.294
Sugar works out of an old
foundry at 133rd and 6th.

13:49.319 --> 13:51.736
Oh, that reminds me.

13:57.776 --> 13:59.308
It's Harvey. Leave a message.

13:59.345 --> 14:01.720
I'm with Barnes, heading
to 133rd and 6th.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.109
Get there.

14:05.017 --> 14:07.552
(siren whoops, whistle blows)

14:11.356 --> 14:14.492
You never know what's gonna go down.

14:17.763 --> 14:20.264
(tires squealing)

14:36.964 --> 14:39.732
I have to say, Jim,

14:39.800 --> 14:41.901
I'm disappointed with you.

14:41.969 --> 14:44.270
Oh, yeah? How's that?

14:44.338 --> 14:47.473
Lead detective for a
high-profile murder,

14:47.541 --> 14:50.802
and you don't collect statements
from everyone present?

14:52.579 --> 14:53.846
Me.

14:53.914 --> 14:55.481
(sighs)

14:55.549 --> 14:57.149
Well, let's do it now.

14:57.217 --> 14:59.004
And for the record, I
waive my right to counsel.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.054
- Captain...
- Ask your questions, Gordon.

15:02.122 --> 15:03.956
(siren blaring)

15:04.583 --> 15:06.916
Did you see Symon at the party?

15:07.164 --> 15:08.616
Yes.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.901
- Did you talk to him?
- No, I did not.

15:11.969 --> 15:15.438
Did you see him go into the
bathroom before he was attacked?

15:15.506 --> 15:17.507
Unfortunately, no.

15:17.574 --> 15:19.909
Were you ever in it?

15:19.977 --> 15:22.044
Yes.

15:23.226 --> 15:26.115
Before it was a crime scene, obviously.

15:27.718 --> 15:31.320
So, Detective, am I in the clear?

15:31.388 --> 15:32.889
For now.

15:32.956 --> 15:34.023
(chuckles)

15:36.326 --> 15:38.294
(engine revving)

15:38.362 --> 15:40.096
This city's a cesspool.

15:40.163 --> 15:42.965
Don't you ever want to
do something about it?

15:43.033 --> 15:45.568
I thought I was.

15:45.636 --> 15:47.670
What, as a cop?

15:47.738 --> 15:50.139
I would think that you, of all people,

15:50.207 --> 15:52.208
would find that limiting.

15:52.276 --> 15:54.477
Not anymore.

15:54.545 --> 15:57.446
Came back to the GCPD
to do things right.

15:57.514 --> 15:59.682
Like you.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.852
- Like me?
- Last year,

16:02.920 --> 16:04.687
at Galavan's, when we were attacked,

16:04.755 --> 16:08.558
you told me the law shows
you where the line is.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.192
That stuck with me.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.862
Some would say that our
job, first and foremost,

16:12.930 --> 16:15.798
is to protect the citizens of this city,

16:15.866 --> 16:17.800
even if it means bending the laws.

16:17.868 --> 16:20.603
No. We break the law, we're
no better than the criminals.

16:20.671 --> 16:22.171
(chuckles)

16:22.239 --> 16:23.806
Is that what you were thinking

16:23.874 --> 16:25.775
the night that Galavan was killed?

16:25.842 --> 16:27.343
The first time.

16:27.411 --> 16:30.613
This city's at a crossroads, Gordon.

16:30.681 --> 16:35.051
Question is... Will
good men fight for it?

16:35.118 --> 16:38.087
Will they do what's necessary?

16:38.155 --> 16:41.324
The decision is yours to make.

16:46.196 --> 16:50.566
You passed our stop. 133rd and 6th?

16:50.634 --> 16:52.969
Did I say that?

16:53.036 --> 16:56.105
136th and 3rd.

16:56.173 --> 16:59.008
It's an honest mistake.

17:02.045 --> 17:03.913
- Mmm.
- BRUCE: I don't believe it.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.015
- Mmm.
- Well, I should have known.

17:06.083 --> 17:08.651
I saw what that freak Marv could do.

17:08.719 --> 17:10.720
How he could age people, and when

17:10.787 --> 17:13.856
he told me that the girl wearing
her sweater was older, I...

17:13.924 --> 17:16.525
I should have realized.

17:16.593 --> 17:17.893
BRUCE: That's really Ivy.

17:17.961 --> 17:19.194
Trust me.

17:19.262 --> 17:21.797
She came, and literally ate all my food.

17:21.865 --> 17:23.699
Immediately ate all my food.

17:23.767 --> 17:25.034
It's her.

17:25.102 --> 17:28.270
So why is she back here?

17:28.338 --> 17:30.139
Good question.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.076
Ow! What was that for?

17:34.144 --> 17:37.046
For being alive and not telling me!

17:40.617 --> 17:42.852
I'm sorry.

17:42.919 --> 17:45.321
(Selina sighs)

17:49.860 --> 17:51.093
I was just having fun.

17:51.161 --> 17:52.338
Why did you come back?

17:52.884 --> 17:54.964
I don't have to answer your questions.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.198
Why'd you call him anyway?

17:56.266 --> 17:57.833
'Cause you freaked me out!

17:57.901 --> 18:00.236
Where have you been, and

18:00.303 --> 18:02.238
why are you dressed like that?

18:02.305 --> 18:04.707
Oh, it's so crazy, Selina.

18:04.775 --> 18:06.308
When you look like this,

18:06.376 --> 18:09.045
guys just come up to
you and give you stuff.

18:09.112 --> 18:11.480
Half the time, you don't
even have to steal it.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.416
Hmm. And what do you give them?

18:14.491 --> 18:16.852
Hmm. I have ways of getting what I want.

18:16.920 --> 18:20.008
- I'll bet.
- You do look nice.

18:23.794 --> 18:25.261
(scoffs)

18:25.328 --> 18:27.163
SELINA: So why did you come back?

18:27.230 --> 18:29.532
And don't say it's 'cause you missed me.

18:29.599 --> 18:31.434
It's true.

18:31.501 --> 18:34.770
You may be ten feet tall, but
you're still a crappy liar, Ivy.

18:34.838 --> 18:36.872
What's... going... on?

18:36.940 --> 18:38.774
(sighs)

18:38.842 --> 18:40.876
Well, I might be in trouble.

18:40.944 --> 18:43.112
- I knew it.
- There was this guy...

18:43.180 --> 18:46.348
- What was his name?
- Like I learn their names.

18:46.416 --> 18:47.950
So I was at his place last night.

18:48.018 --> 18:50.553
Total creep. Anyway, I stole a necklace.

18:50.620 --> 18:54.123
I was surprised he noticed
'cause he had so much crap.

18:54.191 --> 18:56.325
But he caught me, and
he totally freaked out.

18:56.393 --> 18:58.060
If only Marv's power
had made you smart, too.

18:58.128 --> 19:00.563
- You steal all the time.
- Yeah, well,

19:00.630 --> 19:02.298
- I don't get caught.
- Shh.

19:02.365 --> 19:03.866
Rude.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.167
No. Be-be quiet.

19:05.235 --> 19:07.903
(clattering) I hear something.

19:14.211 --> 19:16.912
(door quietly creaks open)

19:17.714 --> 19:19.482
We have to go.

19:19.549 --> 19:22.618
Someone's here. (pounding on door)

19:22.686 --> 19:24.120
Ivy, in.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.058
Bruce! Seriously?

19:34.965 --> 19:37.333
(mutters)

19:38.769 --> 19:41.036
(door creaks open)

19:41.104 --> 19:44.740
So who is this guy again?

19:44.808 --> 19:46.809
Just follow my lead.

19:46.877 --> 19:48.744
- (grunts)
- GCPD!

19:48.812 --> 19:51.080
- Don't move!
- Hey. Whoa. Whoa.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.549
- Hiya, Sugar.
- What the hell is this?

19:53.617 --> 19:55.417
We're here about the gas bill.

19:55.485 --> 19:56.852
You're delinquent.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.320
- Huh?
- Where were you

19:58.388 --> 19:59.922
last night, say about 10:00 p.m.?

19:59.990 --> 20:01.924
At your mama's, like always.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.116
Answer the question.

20:03.154 --> 20:04.692
I was at the fights.
A dozen people saw me.

20:04.742 --> 20:07.797
A dozen of your lying,
bottom-feeding friends?

20:07.864 --> 20:10.099
The name Symon mean anything to you?

20:10.167 --> 20:12.268
- No.
- BARNES: No?

20:12.335 --> 20:15.437
Plastic surgeon? Face
man for your mob buddies?

20:15.505 --> 20:18.507
Wait... No.

20:18.575 --> 20:24.046
Like I said, so whatever the
hell you think I did, I didn't.

20:24.114 --> 20:25.581
I was at the fights!

20:25.649 --> 20:27.383
People saw me!

20:27.450 --> 20:29.937
- I'm innocent, man!
- BARNES: You know what?

20:30.483 --> 20:32.254
I think he's telling the truth.

20:33.484 --> 20:34.957
He didn't kill anyone.

20:38.568 --> 20:40.162
But you're not innocent.

20:41.531 --> 20:44.133
(groans, thudding)

21:03.164 --> 21:04.798
BRUCE: I think we lost them.

21:05.299 --> 21:07.434
Is that who you stole the necklace from?

21:07.501 --> 21:10.136
Uh, no. I-I don't think so.

21:10.204 --> 21:12.472
Then who were they?

21:12.540 --> 21:14.507
I don't know. Maybe they work for him.

21:14.575 --> 21:17.310
Oh, great, Ivy! Now my squat is burned,

21:17.378 --> 21:19.579
and masked weirdoes
are trying to kill us.

21:19.647 --> 21:21.548
So glad you came back.

21:22.783 --> 21:24.705
You have to return it.

21:25.474 --> 21:27.420
What? No way.

21:27.488 --> 21:28.988
SELINA: Ivy, he's right.

21:29.056 --> 21:30.875
That dumb necklace almost got us killed.

21:30.937 --> 21:33.026
It's mine. I worked for it.

21:33.094 --> 21:34.661
And it's super valuable.

21:34.729 --> 21:37.230
- How much?
- Wait. Bruce, don't.

21:37.298 --> 21:40.600
If I buy it, you get paid,
but we can still return it,

21:40.668 --> 21:42.902
and those men will have
no reason to harm us.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.270
How much?

21:47.141 --> 21:50.410
- One thousand dollars.
- Fine.

21:50.478 --> 21:51.544
(scoffs) Idiot.

21:51.612 --> 21:53.697
- Two thousand.
- Fine.

21:55.161 --> 21:57.751
Five... No. Ten!

21:57.818 --> 21:59.486
Well, how much should I ask for?

21:59.553 --> 22:01.733
BRUCE: I'll get you
$5,000 in cash today.

22:01.807 --> 22:04.724
Or you can try to avoid
those men on your own.

22:06.666 --> 22:09.028
That's my offer.

22:15.069 --> 22:16.603
(chain jangling)

22:17.905 --> 22:20.807
Now, where does this man live?

22:20.875 --> 22:22.909
(sighs)

22:24.906 --> 22:27.547
Now, just raise your chin a mite higher.

22:27.615 --> 22:30.750
(operatic music playing)

22:30.818 --> 22:33.277
Would you excuse me for a moment?

22:35.956 --> 22:38.558
(music playing loudly)

22:43.364 --> 22:45.365
Ed.

22:45.433 --> 22:47.033
Yes.

22:47.101 --> 22:49.102
The music!

22:49.170 --> 22:52.439
It's too loud. I'm sorry!

22:52.506 --> 22:54.707
(music stops)

22:54.775 --> 22:56.910
Isabella always loved Vivaldi.

22:56.977 --> 23:00.017
So you are just going to sit here.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.248
- Yes.
- All by yourself.

23:02.323 --> 23:03.983
Correct.

23:04.985 --> 23:06.920
Okay then.

23:13.294 --> 23:16.229
(sighs) Apologies.

23:25.306 --> 23:28.508
Ed, I, as much as anyone,

23:28.576 --> 23:30.243
know how hard it is to lose someone.

23:30.311 --> 23:33.046
- (sighs)
- Even if

23:33.113 --> 23:35.715
you've only known them
for, like... a week.

23:35.783 --> 23:39.018
But this is not healthy behavior.

23:39.086 --> 23:40.553
It is depressing

23:40.621 --> 23:43.056
and, if I'm being honest,

23:43.123 --> 23:44.757
a bit scary.

23:46.494 --> 23:48.161
Less scary.

23:48.229 --> 23:49.429
Check.

23:49.497 --> 23:51.297
No, you're not...

23:51.365 --> 23:52.632
(sighs)

23:52.700 --> 23:54.634
Ed, you need to heal.

23:54.702 --> 23:56.836
And healing is about moving on.

23:59.874 --> 24:01.841
No doubt you're right.

24:01.909 --> 24:04.878
Of course I'm right.

24:11.185 --> 24:13.686
I'll go to where she was taken from me

24:13.754 --> 24:15.889
and say good-bye.

24:22.429 --> 24:24.813
Isabelle would want you to be happy.

24:26.534 --> 24:28.001
<i>Isabella.</i>

24:28.068 --> 24:30.103
(chuckles)

24:30.170 --> 24:31.905
Of course.

24:42.316 --> 24:44.217
BARNES: That's good.

24:44.285 --> 24:46.252
That's far enough.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.187
(grunting)

24:49.033 --> 24:50.990
I know what you're thinking, Jim.

24:51.058 --> 24:52.725
You're thinking,

24:52.793 --> 24:55.295
"Why would Captain Nathaniel Barnes,

24:55.362 --> 24:56.896
"Mr. By-the-book, blow a hole

24:56.964 --> 24:59.866
"in this unarmed scumbag?

24:59.934 --> 25:03.002
Could it be that he
actually killed Symon, too?"

25:03.070 --> 25:06.839
You see, I know that you've
been investigating me, Jim.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.943
- Did you kill Symon?
- Is that

25:10.010 --> 25:12.512
what he told you? I know he said
something to you before he died.

25:12.580 --> 25:14.814
Yes, he did.

25:14.882 --> 25:17.517
Probably the truest words
that bastard ever uttered.

25:19.587 --> 25:21.521
And Paulie Pennies?

25:21.589 --> 25:22.922
He chopped up bodies for murderers.

25:22.990 --> 25:24.424
You gonna tell me he didn't deserve it?

25:24.491 --> 25:26.159
That's for the law to decide.

25:26.226 --> 25:28.127
Open your eyes, Jim.

25:28.195 --> 25:29.896
I am the law.

25:30.831 --> 25:32.465
What happened to you?

25:32.533 --> 25:34.200
How did you become this?

25:34.268 --> 25:35.868
This...

25:35.936 --> 25:38.605
is who I've always been.

25:38.672 --> 25:42.775
I just needed something to unlock it.

25:42.843 --> 25:44.243
What are you talking about?

25:44.311 --> 25:47.447
You're just gonna say that I'm sick.

25:47.514 --> 25:49.315
Well, I'm not.

25:49.383 --> 25:52.218
I have never been so clear,

25:52.286 --> 25:55.421
so strong in my life.

25:55.489 --> 25:57.590
Alice Tetch's virus.

25:57.658 --> 26:00.159
The files on your desk. You're infected.

26:00.227 --> 26:03.262
Oh, you are a detective after all.

26:03.330 --> 26:04.964
Don't you see?

26:05.032 --> 26:07.567
This means you're innocent. We c...

26:07.635 --> 26:08.635
we-we can get you help.

26:08.702 --> 26:09.936
Can we just skip the part

26:10.004 --> 26:11.838
where you try to get
me to give myself up?

26:11.905 --> 26:14.107
This isn't you. This is the virus.

26:14.174 --> 26:16.442
No! I'm not insane.

26:16.510 --> 26:19.178
And you are not seeing the big picture.

26:21.882 --> 26:24.606
You're gonna frame me
for Sugar's murder.

26:24.643 --> 26:26.519
That's up to you.

26:27.388 --> 26:29.389
I deal in absolutes.

26:29.456 --> 26:31.424
Black and white.

26:31.492 --> 26:33.292
Innocence

26:33.360 --> 26:34.761
and guilt.

26:34.828 --> 26:38.598
Gotham, the people of this
city, need men like me,

26:38.666 --> 26:40.333
men who can see what needs to be done

26:40.401 --> 26:42.168
and have the courage to do it.

26:42.236 --> 26:45.038
You have it within you

26:45.105 --> 26:46.639
to be one of those men.

26:46.707 --> 26:49.008
You want me to join you?

26:49.076 --> 26:51.778
- Be a part of this?
- Oh, don't be so high and mighty.

26:51.845 --> 26:54.380
You shot Galavan in cold blood.

26:54.448 --> 26:55.982
And every day I wish I hadn't!

26:56.050 --> 26:58.151
Thought I didn't have
a choice, but I did.

26:59.286 --> 27:01.554
I lost my freedom.

27:01.622 --> 27:03.489
I lost Lee.

27:03.557 --> 27:05.558
I'd give anything to take it all back.

27:05.626 --> 27:07.427
I didn't say it was easy,

27:07.494 --> 27:08.995
Jim.

27:09.063 --> 27:10.697
I said it was right.

27:10.764 --> 27:12.398
Day after day, criminals

27:12.466 --> 27:14.400
thumbing their nose at the law.

27:14.468 --> 27:17.303
Well, today, I draw a line in the sand.

27:17.371 --> 27:19.005
Only question is...

27:21.475 --> 27:23.576
where do you stand?

27:30.184 --> 27:31.951
Against you.

27:33.220 --> 27:34.887
(sighs)

27:34.955 --> 27:37.056
Well, I'm disappointed.

27:37.124 --> 27:38.991
Good-bye, Jim.

27:39.059 --> 27:40.760
MAN: Hey, Sugar! I got a... Whoa!

27:42.963 --> 27:43.963
- (racks shotgun)
- (whimpering)

27:44.932 --> 27:47.233
- (gunshot)
- (grunting)

28:08.774 --> 28:10.859
♪♪

28:11.018 --> 28:14.153
And now I'm awake.

28:15.122 --> 28:18.190
I wish I'd gone on sleeping.

28:19.326 --> 28:22.461
I will never forget you, my love.

28:29.169 --> 28:32.371
Good-bye, Isabella.

28:42.121 --> 28:44.856
We are four blocks from her apartment.

28:47.694 --> 28:50.295
- (jangling)
- Spare some change, sir?

28:50.363 --> 28:53.231
(coins clinking)

28:53.299 --> 28:54.800
I'm sorry,

28:54.867 --> 28:57.591
you weren't, perchance, in this
area at 11:00 p.m. last night?

28:57.566 --> 28:58.904
Uh-huh.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.363
So d... You saw the accident?

29:01.400 --> 29:03.842
Haven't seen nothin' for 20 years.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.143
But I heard it.

29:05.211 --> 29:07.679
Girl screaming, "Help! Help!"

29:07.747 --> 29:10.716
- Then bang!
- I'm sorry,

29:10.783 --> 29:13.085
she was screaming before the crash?

29:13.152 --> 29:14.920
Well, she were dead after.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.347
But you d... you
definitely heard screaming?

29:16.384 --> 29:20.492
Yep. Blood-curdling. (jangling)

29:20.560 --> 29:21.660
(clink)

29:21.728 --> 29:23.328
(jangling)

29:24.430 --> 29:26.609
How... odd.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.668
I'll give him the necklace

29:29.736 --> 29:32.504
and explain there's no
need for further violence.

29:33.717 --> 29:35.974
Maybe I shouldn't be here.

29:36.042 --> 29:38.450
I kind of hit him over
the head with a vase.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.178
'Course you did.

29:41.047 --> 29:42.848
Door's open.

29:48.721 --> 29:50.240
I did not do that.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.821
We really got to go.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.894
- Bruce.
- It was the men that came after us.

29:55.962 --> 29:57.362
He was killed by the same weapon.

29:57.430 --> 29:59.097
- I thought they worked for him.
- Oh, looks like

29:59.165 --> 30:01.266
you were wrong again, Ivy.

30:01.334 --> 30:03.435
- (chain jangling)
- Can we leave now?

30:03.503 --> 30:05.570
Why is this necklace so important?

30:05.638 --> 30:06.905
What'd make someone kill for it?

30:06.973 --> 30:08.673
Who cares?!

30:08.741 --> 30:13.078
Are you crazy? That's worth $5,000.

30:13.146 --> 30:15.580
Whoa.

30:15.648 --> 30:18.150
BRUCE: What is it?

30:18.217 --> 30:19.484
A key.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.894
We should really go, Bruce.

30:30.797 --> 30:33.131
Oh, my God.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.433
You two are a couple now?

30:35.501 --> 30:38.403
- No.
- Yes.

30:38.471 --> 30:40.839
We're not?

30:40.907 --> 30:43.275
I'm not talking about this right now.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.377
We need to go somewhere right now.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.579
And my place is toast,
thanks to this dimwit.

30:47.647 --> 30:49.815
We'll go to my house.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.632
You just had to come back.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.789
(sighs)

30:57.857 --> 31:00.325
(indistinct chatter)

31:04.430 --> 31:06.264
Alvarez, hey,

31:06.332 --> 31:08.300
- what is all this?
- Barnes called in.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.368
Gordon went loco. Shot
an unarmed suspect,

31:10.436 --> 31:12.070
then tried taking out Barnes, too.

31:12.138 --> 31:14.005
No, no, no, no. This is not right.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.473
Harvey, if I was you,

31:15.541 --> 31:18.143
I'd find your partner,
have him come in quiet.

31:18.211 --> 31:20.145
Otherwise, he's going down.

31:20.213 --> 31:23.481
(phone ringing)

31:24.550 --> 31:26.685
Jim? Hey.

31:26.752 --> 31:29.154
Where the hell are you? Half
the precinct's looking for you.

31:29.222 --> 31:31.489
Barnes killed Symon and Paulie Pennies.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.558
And he just murdered someone
right in front of me!

31:33.626 --> 31:36.361
What? (stammers) I was
gone for, like, an hour.

31:36.429 --> 31:38.363
He's infected with Alice Tetch's blood.

31:38.431 --> 31:39.959
He's lost his mind.
He's trying to kill me.

31:40.021 --> 31:43.969
- Oh, sweet gentle virgin...
- I need your help, Harvey.

31:44.036 --> 31:47.205
- Okay, where are you?
- The old foundry.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.541
(gunshot)

31:50.943 --> 31:53.411
BULLOCK: Jim? Jim?

31:53.479 --> 31:55.413
J...

31:59.252 --> 32:01.186
Harvey, what's going on?

32:01.254 --> 32:04.556
- They said Jim killed someone?
- It's a lie. It's Barnes.

32:04.624 --> 32:07.359
It's Barnes. He's infected
with the Alice Tetch virus.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.594
Oh, my God.

32:09.662 --> 32:11.029
He was there when she died.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.530
Yeah, and I figure we
got, like, ten minutes

32:12.598 --> 32:14.833
before those trigger-happy
kill-bots find Jim

32:14.901 --> 32:16.001
and take him out.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.168
Harvey, you have to tell them.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.970
Come on, they're not gonna believe me.

32:19.038 --> 32:21.306
But they will believe
the medical examiner.

32:21.374 --> 32:25.143
- What are you asking me to do?
- I need you to trust Jim.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.444
Because right now,

32:26.512 --> 32:28.613
you and I are all he has.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.558
(rattling)

32:52.571 --> 32:54.706
(footsteps approaching)

33:00.913 --> 33:02.414
(groaning)

33:17.730 --> 33:20.432
- (shotgun racks)
- Stop!

33:23.050 --> 33:25.503
Sorry, Jim.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.909
End of the line.

33:53.309 --> 33:54.842
(grunting)

33:56.478 --> 33:58.980
Just as I suspected.

33:59.048 --> 34:00.815
The brake lines are cut!

34:00.883 --> 34:02.517
How is it...

34:02.585 --> 34:05.453
that not one single
ignoramus from the GCPD

34:05.521 --> 34:07.222
noticed that the brake lines were cut?

34:07.289 --> 34:09.657
I don't know.

34:09.725 --> 34:12.226
Someone paid 'em off.

34:12.293 --> 34:13.728
The question is, who?

34:13.795 --> 34:16.397
Who has that kind of
money and influence?

34:17.632 --> 34:19.132
You don't know.

34:19.201 --> 34:21.135
But I do.

34:25.774 --> 34:27.875
BARNES: <i>End of the line.</i>

34:30.446 --> 34:32.013
No more running.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.482
(sirens wailing in distance)

34:34.550 --> 34:35.717
(short chuckle)

34:35.784 --> 34:37.385
Just in time. In a few moments,

34:37.453 --> 34:40.054
your brothers in arms are
gonna come up those stairs

34:40.121 --> 34:42.489
and find your dead body,
and they'll believe me

34:42.558 --> 34:45.795
when I tell them that
Jim Gordon is a killer.

34:45.982 --> 34:47.594
It's a shame, really.

34:47.663 --> 34:49.731
Could've made a great team.

34:49.797 --> 34:52.300
Doesn't have to be this way.

34:52.368 --> 34:53.467
You need help.

34:53.534 --> 34:56.004
Are those really gonna
be your last words?

34:56.071 --> 34:57.772
(sirens approaching)

34:58.674 --> 34:59.841
Nothing to say to Lee?

34:59.908 --> 35:01.442
(tires screeching outside)

35:01.510 --> 35:02.810
(sirens stop)

35:02.878 --> 35:04.345
Go to hell.

35:06.649 --> 35:08.850
BULLOCK (on megaphone): Captain Barnes!

35:08.917 --> 35:10.685
This is Detective Bullock.

35:10.753 --> 35:12.453
You're under arrest.

35:12.521 --> 35:14.122
Throw down your weapons

35:14.189 --> 35:16.758
and come out with your hands up.

35:16.825 --> 35:18.326
We know you killed Symon.

35:18.394 --> 35:20.328
We know you killed Paulie Pennies.

35:20.396 --> 35:23.898
We know you killed the
suspects in the East End.

35:23.966 --> 35:25.800
You're infected with the Tetch virus.

35:25.868 --> 35:28.770
The M.E. has proof.

35:28.837 --> 35:30.405
Now, we don't want any bloodshed, Cap.

35:30.472 --> 35:32.106
It's up to you.

35:32.174 --> 35:33.541
No.

35:33.609 --> 35:34.976
Thompkins and Bullock.

35:35.044 --> 35:37.812
They lied for you.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.581
They turned the whole
damn GCPD against me!

35:40.649 --> 35:41.983
(grunting)

35:42.051 --> 35:44.118
We're going in. Come on!

35:46.388 --> 35:48.323
(both grunting)

36:08.310 --> 36:09.677
Don't.

36:11.380 --> 36:12.714
You're under arrest.

36:14.049 --> 36:15.616
Drop it.

36:15.684 --> 36:17.051
No.

36:20.122 --> 36:21.656
Don't make me do this.

36:21.724 --> 36:23.658
I'm not making you do anything.

36:23.726 --> 36:26.094
Stand down, Jim. Let me go.

36:27.863 --> 36:30.398
If the cops want to hunt me, fine.

36:30.466 --> 36:32.133
But you...

36:32.201 --> 36:33.468
let me go.

36:33.535 --> 36:35.903
I won't do that.

36:35.971 --> 36:38.339
You would condemn this city

36:38.407 --> 36:39.707
when I would save it.

36:39.775 --> 36:42.677
You've got it all wrong.

36:42.745 --> 36:44.979
You're just the same as I am.

36:45.047 --> 36:46.714
I just have the guts to admit it.

36:46.782 --> 36:48.616
No.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.518
And I'll decide who I am.

36:52.321 --> 36:54.122
Stand down.

36:56.792 --> 36:58.393
No.

37:00.529 --> 37:03.331
Then it is you that is guilty.

37:03.399 --> 37:04.932
(gunshots)

37:11.407 --> 37:13.341
(grunts)

37:16.745 --> 37:18.279
Jim, you okay?

37:20.382 --> 37:21.749
Yeah.

37:21.817 --> 37:23.451
I'm okay.

37:41.237 --> 37:44.850
Holy cow. Don't get any ideas.

37:44.884 --> 37:46.218
Okay, Mom.

37:46.286 --> 37:48.153
Tomorrow we'll look into
what this all means.

37:48.221 --> 37:50.222
Who those men in masks were.

37:50.290 --> 37:53.191
For now, I'll have Alfred
make up beds for you both.

37:53.259 --> 37:55.394
There's food in the
kitchen if you're hungry.

37:55.461 --> 37:56.795
I could eat.

37:56.863 --> 37:58.397
Surprise.

38:03.136 --> 38:05.637
I hope I didn't mess things
up with your boyfriend.

38:05.705 --> 38:09.174
I told you, he's not my boyfriend.

38:13.179 --> 38:15.113
- (cats yowl)
- (glass breaks)

38:52.518 --> 38:54.753
(indistinct conversations)

39:04.130 --> 39:05.597
What happened?

39:05.665 --> 39:07.599
Are you okay?

39:08.668 --> 39:10.202
Yeah.

39:10.269 --> 39:12.404
I'm fine.

39:15.742 --> 39:17.376
And Barnes?

39:17.443 --> 39:20.012
He's alive.

39:21.214 --> 39:23.415
Bullock told me what you did.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.318
- It was nothing.
- No.

39:26.386 --> 39:28.453
You could've done nothing.

39:28.521 --> 39:30.489
You didn't. I suppose I did

39:30.556 --> 39:32.958
fabricate a blood test
stating that my superior

39:33.026 --> 39:35.460
had a psychosis-inducing virus.

39:39.065 --> 39:40.532
And I'm glad I did.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.067
Me, too.

39:51.244 --> 39:53.679
I suppose I better get going.

39:53.746 --> 39:54.846
Lee?

40:00.553 --> 40:02.087
Thank you.

40:17.070 --> 40:18.603
NYGMA: Oswald!

40:18.671 --> 40:21.139
Oswald. I need to speak with you.

40:21.207 --> 40:23.043
Yes, but I have to show
you something first.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.444
- This is important.
- So is this.

40:28.114 --> 40:30.849
I was not compassionate this morning,

40:30.917 --> 40:32.384
and I regret that.

40:32.452 --> 40:36.121
What you are going through is terrible.

40:36.189 --> 40:38.323
So...

40:49.268 --> 40:50.502
You put me in your painting.

40:50.570 --> 40:52.704
The artist went off a photograph,

40:52.772 --> 40:55.807
but I think it's an excellent likeness.

40:58.211 --> 40:59.778
Isabella was murdered.

41:01.147 --> 41:02.347
What?

41:02.415 --> 41:04.249
I went to the intersection
where she died.

41:04.317 --> 41:08.220
It is four blocks from her apartment.

41:08.287 --> 41:10.622
Who falls asleep four blocks
from their home? No one.

41:10.690 --> 41:13.725
Also, a very fragrant homeless man

41:13.793 --> 41:15.193
said that he heard her
scream before the crash,

41:15.261 --> 41:16.595
so definitely not asleep. Now,

41:16.662 --> 41:19.030
if she were awake, why didn't she brake?

41:19.098 --> 41:22.367
- Why are there no skid marks?
- E-Ed, you are exhausted,

41:22.435 --> 41:23.869
you are, you are emotional...

41:23.936 --> 41:26.271
Her brake lines were cut!

41:26.339 --> 41:28.507
Which leaves one conclusion.

41:28.574 --> 41:30.675
Murder.

41:30.743 --> 41:32.344
- No.
- Yes.

41:33.490 --> 41:34.880
And I know who did it.

41:36.649 --> 41:37.883
Who?

41:39.752 --> 41:41.186
Butch.

41:43.055 --> 41:44.964
- Butch?
- In retaliation.

41:46.259 --> 41:49.327
For exposing him as the
leader of the Red Hood gang.

41:51.430 --> 41:54.966
That makes perfect sense.

41:55.034 --> 41:57.335
I swear to you, Ed, we will

41:57.403 --> 42:00.205
find him and make him
pay for what he has done.

42:00.273 --> 42:02.340
Thank you.

42:03.442 --> 42:05.644
I knew I could count on you.

42:15.688 --> 42:18.790
I feel like this office is cursed.

42:18.858 --> 42:21.026
You think Barnes'll be all right?

42:21.093 --> 42:23.728
I don't know.

42:25.998 --> 42:27.999
I'm sorry I doubted you.

42:28.067 --> 42:29.401
You didn't.

42:29.468 --> 42:31.670
Not when it mattered.

42:45.017 --> 42:46.885
This never happens.

42:46.887 --> 42:48.553
Oleg!
