00:01.610 --> 00:02.567
DIRECTOR:
Take one.
Rolling, rolling.

00:02.611 --> 00:04.395
Good day. Yay!

00:04.439 --> 00:05.744
Is this okay?

00:05.788 --> 00:07.398
I know to look this way.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.400
Doc style.Oh, wow.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.402
NAVEDO:
Okay, I'm gonna

00:11.446 --> 00:13.404
start crying already.

00:13.448 --> 00:16.320
Okay, go.
Start at the beginning.

00:16.364 --> 00:19.802
I just felt like
I was holding on to gold.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.717
It was so smart.DR. SPINOZA: You're pregnant.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.197
But I've never had sex.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.894
JANE:
I'm a writer.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.896
BALDONI:
Our show has had

00:26.939 --> 00:28.550
so many huge moments
over the five years.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.073
ROGELIO:
She's here!

00:30.117 --> 00:31.248
Cue the music!No, wait. Stop.

00:32.597 --> 00:33.729
The journey has been amazing.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.210
Jane...
Yes!

00:36.253 --> 00:37.994
Okay. Yes.
Okay.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.300
I couldn't even put it
into words.

00:39.343 --> 00:41.215
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know. OMG, right?

00:41.258 --> 00:42.738
GUESTS:
Surprise!

00:44.131 --> 00:45.219
It just has a little
extra magic to it.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.177
I love it so much.

00:48.787 --> 00:51.094
Dad, kiss Mom.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.096
There are so many
take-me-back moments.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.489
He's beautiful.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.099
JANE:
Tonight is

00:56.143 --> 00:58.101
everything I've ever dreamed.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.930
I love you. I do.

01:00.973 --> 01:03.541
CAMIL:
It's full of love.

01:03.585 --> 01:04.716
We love what we do.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.979
It is a lovefest.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.417
Mommy.COLL: That's one of my

01:09.460 --> 01:11.158
favorite moments.Yay!

01:12.637 --> 01:14.509
I can't imagine it ending.

01:14.552 --> 01:15.988
It's changed my life.

01:16.032 --> 01:19.601
BALDONI:
The fans can expect a very

01:19.644 --> 01:20.732
Jane the Virginending.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.040
It's a good show.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.172
Chin up, Jane!

01:25.215 --> 01:27.304
â™ª Mm, mm.

01:43.407 --> 01:44.930
RODRIGUEZ: When I was getting
asked to audition

01:44.974 --> 01:46.497
for a pilot
where I was being

01:46.541 --> 01:49.152
the lead in a show that was
called Jane the Virgin...

01:49.196 --> 01:50.588
Come on,
let's get up.

01:50.632 --> 01:53.069
But you're not
feeling good.
Mom.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.505
RODRIGUEZ:
...I was just, like,
a little, like thrown off.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.725
I was like, "What? They want me?
They know who I am?"

01:59.815 --> 02:01.164
Jane.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.600
NAVEDO:
When I read the logline,

02:02.644 --> 02:04.167
20-something-year-old virgin

02:04.211 --> 02:06.300
gets artificially
inseminated by mistake,

02:06.343 --> 02:09.477
I'm like, "Oh, my God.
Please. Really?"

02:10.521 --> 02:12.306
Nausea and fainting spell
solved.

02:12.349 --> 02:13.611
You're pregnant.

02:16.048 --> 02:17.615
NAVEDO:
But when I saw

02:17.659 --> 02:19.487
the finished pilot...

02:19.530 --> 02:21.663
Jane, did you
and Michael...?

02:21.706 --> 02:22.838
No. We didn't.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.883
And it may be rare,
but it happened,

02:24.927 --> 02:27.364
'cause I'm a virgin.A virgin.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.845
SNYDER URMAN:
It's based on
an Venezuelan telenovela.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.542
So the whole story just kind
of came to me

02:31.586 --> 02:34.023
of this girl
who loved telenovelas

02:34.066 --> 02:36.634
so much that all of a sudden
her life became like one.

02:36.678 --> 02:39.463
I accidentally inseminated you
two weeks ago.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.464
You what?
You what?

02:40.508 --> 02:42.205
I read the script and I thought

02:42.249 --> 02:43.902
it was so brilliantly written.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.651
I thought something in Spanish
and English, what the hell?

02:53.695 --> 02:55.566
Oh, I don't even know how
to say this in Spanish.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.743
No. No, I didn't.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.876
And then, when I started
to look at it,

03:00.919 --> 03:03.487
and then when I started
to read it, then I got it.

03:03.531 --> 03:07.274
She accidentally put

03:07.317 --> 03:10.929
a sample of a man into me.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.890
I was excited.
I thought it was a great idea.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.371
Michael,
what are you doing?

03:17.414 --> 03:18.589
And it was very original.
I'd never seen,

03:18.633 --> 03:19.721
really, anything like it.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.026
Jane...

03:21.070 --> 03:23.333
Gloriana Villanueva,

03:23.377 --> 03:25.292
w... will you...?

03:25.335 --> 03:27.032
Michael, I'm pregnant.

03:27.076 --> 03:29.121
RODRIGUEZ:
I knew it was special

03:29.165 --> 03:30.819
from the moment
I read the script.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.908
Uh, I knew it was something
different from the moment

03:32.951 --> 03:34.344
I saw our pilot.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.564
I love you
because you're my best friend.

03:36.607 --> 03:39.871
And I want to grow old
with you.

03:39.915 --> 03:42.265
And five years in, I still feel
like I'm living something

03:42.309 --> 03:44.398
that's still very different
and new.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.269
Wow.I love you.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.274
SNYDER URMAN:
The love story
at the center of the show

03:51.318 --> 03:53.581
is Jane and her mom
and her grandmother.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.409
At least you could
turn it down.

03:57.585 --> 03:58.847
Mom, she doesn't have to watch
if she doesn't want to.

03:58.890 --> 03:59.978
Of course I'm gonna watch.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.153
You guys got me hooked
on these things.

04:01.197 --> 04:03.112
COLL:
TV, you rarely see

04:03.155 --> 04:05.854
three female Latinas

04:05.897 --> 04:07.682
being in charge
of their lives.

04:07.725 --> 04:10.032
Michael, welcome to
your first family meeting.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.555
Proud to be representing
the male point of view.

04:11.599 --> 04:12.904
Oh, see, I wouldn't
lead with that,

04:12.948 --> 04:15.690
'cause that's not gonna do well
in our meetings.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.866
All the joy and all the pain
of life contained within

04:17.909 --> 04:20.521
this one family.What if I don't like it?

04:20.564 --> 04:22.740
The baby?All of it.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.351
We all can relate
to this family,

04:24.394 --> 04:26.353
and we all can desire
to have a family

04:26.396 --> 04:28.006
as strong as the Villanuevas.

04:31.096 --> 04:33.055
That's what everybody says,
but what if it isn't?

04:33.098 --> 04:35.318
The family
is what drives the show,

04:35.362 --> 04:38.060
what, you know,
what sets the tone...

04:38.103 --> 04:39.975
We're in this together.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.542
All of us.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.326
CAMIL:
...what people connect with.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.723
RODRIGUEZ:
It is so wonderful
to be a part of a character

04:48.766 --> 04:52.466
who came into this journey
with very strong convictions

04:52.509 --> 04:53.989
of saving herself for marriage,

04:54.032 --> 04:55.469
of what that looks like,

04:55.512 --> 04:57.122
of what family structure
looks like.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.907
My whole life,
I didn't want to end up

04:58.950 --> 05:00.909
an unmarried pregnant woman
like my mom.

05:00.952 --> 05:04.391
But guess what? I'm an unmarried
pregnant woman like my mom.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.088
If you want to make God laugh,
tell him your plans,

05:06.131 --> 05:07.655
7and that's like, number one,
Jane's thing.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.396
I'm sorry that I called you
a jerk the other night.

05:09.439 --> 05:12.355
I was just in this...I'm the father.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.661
What?

05:13.704 --> 05:15.184
She believed that
there was always order

05:15.227 --> 05:17.491
to that madness.

05:17.534 --> 05:18.840
Little early to hear
the heart beat.

05:18.883 --> 05:22.017
SNYDER URMAN:
Jane is this combination

05:22.060 --> 05:23.279
of her grandmother's
strict upbringing,

05:23.323 --> 05:24.715
and her mother's more

05:24.759 --> 05:27.370
free-spirited attitude.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.678
She is romantic,
and she is full of love.

05:30.721 --> 05:33.202
I broke up with Michael.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.509
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Jane knew in her heart

05:35.552 --> 05:36.771
that this was absolutely

05:36.814 --> 05:38.207
the last thing
she should be doing.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.035
BALDONI:
I've heard people say

05:40.078 --> 05:41.602
that the love triangle
in Jane the Virgin

05:41.645 --> 05:43.952
is one of the best ever
on television,

05:43.995 --> 05:46.781
and, biasedly,
I would have to agree.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.696
With Raf and Jane,
that's family.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.959
I'm not gonna leave.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.395
I'm here.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.311
With Michael and Jane,
that was like a,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.095
like a Notebooklove story.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.752
That's amazing.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.101
DIER:
I personally like

06:03.145 --> 06:04.451
Jane and Michael.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.583
Today we would have
been married one year,

06:06.627 --> 06:09.281
so I thought we might
as well celebrate anyway.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.588
I just think he's just
a genuine, great guy.

06:11.632 --> 06:12.807
I had the same thought.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.157
Happy Would-Have-Been
Our-Anniversary.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.898
Oh.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.422
And Rafael, he's also
a great candidate for Jane.

06:19.466 --> 06:20.989
Oh, hey, if you ever want
to use the Marbella gym...

06:21.032 --> 06:23.861
Oh, maybe I'll take you up
on that.
Cool.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.168
Plus, he's just shredded.
I mean,

06:26.211 --> 06:28.388
Justin is in great shape.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.911
Wow. A lot of reps.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.174
You just got
to push yourself.Oh, yeah.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.785
I have empathy
for the Michael shippers.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.047
I love you.

06:36.091 --> 06:37.658
BALDONI:
I would absolutely want a man

06:37.701 --> 06:39.311
to treat my daughter
the way that Jane

06:39.355 --> 06:40.965
was treated by Michael.

06:41.009 --> 06:43.228
Don't think, just tell me,
do you still love me?

06:43.272 --> 06:45.274
Yes.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.536
They feel different to me.
They feel like

06:46.580 --> 06:48.451
different sets of her heart.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.801
BALDONI: This magical world
where you don't know

06:50.845 --> 06:53.151
who you want her
to end up with.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.460
Team Michael.

06:57.504 --> 07:00.028
Print the T-shirts,
make the mugs.

07:00.071 --> 07:01.682
There are no teams
in this family.

07:01.725 --> 07:05.990
Rogelio has always been
Team Jane, to be honest.

07:06.034 --> 07:10.342
So whatever makes Jane happy,
Rogelio will support.

07:10.386 --> 07:13.607
You turned out perfect
without me.

07:13.650 --> 07:17.611
Trust me, I wish I had you.

07:17.654 --> 07:20.178
I absolutely love the fact
that they'd have...

07:20.222 --> 07:24.487
that they have portrayed
a Latino, strong,

07:24.531 --> 07:28.796
extremelyhandsome man
in a...

07:28.839 --> 07:30.798
in a normal way, you know,
full of feelings.

07:30.841 --> 07:33.017
You were incredible, Dad.

07:33.061 --> 07:35.367
Did you just call me "Dad"?

07:35.411 --> 07:37.413
I think I did.

07:38.675 --> 07:39.937
RODRIGUEZ:
Five years ago,

07:39.981 --> 07:41.852
inclusivity wasn't as prevalent
as it is now.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.854
Is there a baby yet?

07:43.898 --> 07:45.987
Mom!

07:46.030 --> 07:48.642
Mom...

07:48.685 --> 07:49.947
I think the show came
at a time

07:49.991 --> 07:52.036
when the world
really needed it.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.299
Five more minutes of pain

07:54.343 --> 07:57.520
for a lifetime of happiness.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.304
A show that,
from top to bottom,

07:59.348 --> 08:01.524
is about representation.

08:01.568 --> 08:04.527
His name is Mateo.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.311
I could completely relate
to these characters,

08:06.355 --> 08:07.704
and it was a breath
of fresh air for me.

08:07.748 --> 08:10.446
That's my Dad's name.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.581
The Villanueva women
in particular represent

08:14.624 --> 08:16.017
a segment of

08:16.060 --> 08:17.671
the society in the United States

08:17.714 --> 08:20.891
that has not been reflected
very often.

08:20.935 --> 08:23.241
Abuela wrote this
to read at my baptism.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.548
I read it at yours,

08:25.592 --> 08:27.071
and I want you to read it
at Mateo's.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.160
Oh...

08:29.204 --> 08:32.337
Growing up, I really didn't see
myself on TV,

08:32.381 --> 08:33.643
my family on TV.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.776
And I really felt invisible.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.692
May you be brave...

08:38.735 --> 08:42.086
"May you always let your faith
be greater than your fear."

08:42.130 --> 08:45.655
And it was really a blow
to my self-esteem

08:45.699 --> 08:47.527
because I felt like
I wasn't important.

08:47.570 --> 08:51.313
"And may you one day
love your own child

08:51.356 --> 08:53.358
as deeply as I love you."

08:53.402 --> 08:55.796
That's why a lot of fans
resonate with the show,

08:55.839 --> 08:58.581
because they feel like
they're being seen,

08:58.625 --> 09:00.627
they're--
like they're included.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.759
I love you, Mateo.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.292
Ho, ho, ho.
No fighting at the North Pole.

09:14.336 --> 09:17.600
Stay out of this, Santa, okay?

09:17.644 --> 09:19.994
BALDONI: Our show has
a really whimsical,

09:20.037 --> 09:21.517
magical, unique style

09:21.561 --> 09:23.954
that was refreshing
for television.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.521
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
A night like this

09:25.565 --> 09:27.915
is just the best feeling
in the world.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.526
So much creativity went into it
on so many levels,

09:30.570 --> 09:34.617
from set design to costumes
to just everything.

09:34.661 --> 09:35.662
RAFAEL:
Didn't you get my text?

09:37.707 --> 09:38.926
Groundbreaking.
I mean, everything

09:38.969 --> 09:40.710
that Jennie decided to do...

09:40.754 --> 09:44.845
NAVEDO: Modern-day technology
with texting and social media

09:44.888 --> 09:46.629
and all that stuff,
how that played into it;

09:46.673 --> 09:47.804
what a great world.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.240
What the hell is going on
over there?

09:49.284 --> 09:51.634
You've been posting pictures
for five hours straight.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.202
NAVEDO:
So awesome.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.378
Well, we're just having fun.

09:56.421 --> 09:57.684
Everything just kind of
added up.

09:57.727 --> 10:00.774
The editing, the music,
the colorful vibe.

10:00.817 --> 10:03.559
It all just kind of
makes your eyes go, like, whoa.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.778
BALDONI:
When you watch the show,
you kind of

10:04.821 --> 10:07.345
just get transported in
to this world

10:07.389 --> 10:09.652
that you want to be a part of.Whoo!

10:09.696 --> 10:11.393
Isn't this better than
some boring dinner party?

10:11.436 --> 10:13.047
And it's funny.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.657
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Rafael stole Petra
from Lachlan.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.311
Then Lachlan tried
to screw over Rafael.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.834
But instead, Petra and Rafael
screwed over Lachlan.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.662
Then Lachlan and Petra
just plain screwed.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.665
Jane the Virginwould not be
Jane the Virgin

10:22.709 --> 10:25.668
without the narrator,
and without Anthony Mendez.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.235
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
They say with children,

10:27.278 --> 10:29.411
the days feel like years.

10:29.454 --> 10:30.673
You can do it, Janie.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.153
There is a storyteller,

10:32.196 --> 10:33.545
and things aren't random,

10:33.589 --> 10:35.373
that everything is going
to be leading up

10:35.417 --> 10:36.810
to a certain moment.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.072
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And the years...

10:38.115 --> 10:39.682
Hurry, Mom! I can't be late

10:39.726 --> 10:41.858
for my first day of junior high.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.686
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
...well, they feel like days.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.080
So I see myself as a friend
to the audience,

10:46.123 --> 10:48.430
like your coach-potato buddy,
sitting there

10:48.473 --> 10:50.171
and excited to get started.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.826
So at the beginning of every
episode, he gets super hyped up,

10:52.869 --> 10:54.566
and he's,
"Welcome back, my friends."

10:54.610 --> 10:56.220
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hey, you guys, welcome back.

10:56.264 --> 10:57.874
When Jane was young,

10:57.918 --> 10:59.267
her grandmother taught her
to protect her flower.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.834
CAMIL:
You need this, you know,

11:00.877 --> 11:02.836
like, "Okay,
and this is what's happening."

11:02.879 --> 11:04.794
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Our Jane was accidentally

11:04.838 --> 11:06.622
inseminated by this hottie,
but she was engaged

11:06.666 --> 11:08.189
to this hottie, so now,

11:08.232 --> 11:09.669
she's in a big old
love triangle.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.845
He's a character on the show.
He's amazing.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.498
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hurry up, Petra! Wait.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.849
Why am I rooting for her?

11:15.892 --> 11:17.938
I've really wanted to, like,
break the fourth wall,

11:17.981 --> 11:20.462
and when he's talking, I would
just look at camera like...

11:20.505 --> 11:22.856
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
As you all well know,

11:22.899 --> 11:25.467
our Jane had
an active imagination.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.643
SNYDER URMAN:
Magical realism on our show

11:27.687 --> 11:29.863
is bringing inanimate objects
to life

11:29.906 --> 11:32.300
and making the world
around you alive

11:32.343 --> 11:34.519
in non-traditional ways.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.957
And it's really a rich tradition
in Latin American storytelling.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.133
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
It should be noted that when

11:39.176 --> 11:43.180
Jane arrived home, well,
she was walking on air.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.573
URMAN:
For us, it's when Jane is

11:44.616 --> 11:45.835
feeling a certain way

11:45.879 --> 11:48.011
and falls in love,
her heart glows.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.883
JANE:
I love him so much.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.754
Her stuffed animals might
talk back to her.

11:51.798 --> 11:52.973
You're doing great.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.018
RODRIGUEZ:
Every moment has been magical.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.977
Every episode has
something special.

11:57.020 --> 11:58.761
â™ª Virginity for you and me

11:58.805 --> 12:00.545
â™ª If you keep your legs closed

12:00.589 --> 12:02.069
â™ª Keep 'em closedâ™ª

12:02.112 --> 12:06.421
â™ª Keep them closed.â™ª

12:06.464 --> 12:07.814
That's what we were--
a dramedy

12:07.857 --> 12:11.034
with some magical realism
moments.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.296
RAFAEL:
Come on, baby.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.255
You know you want me.

12:14.298 --> 12:15.865
I love those.
Those were my favorite to do.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.476
Because the fantasy scenes,
you can kind of be

12:18.520 --> 12:20.348
-larger than life.

12:20.391 --> 12:22.785
RODRIGUEZ:
Synchronized swimming

12:22.829 --> 12:25.179
to playing, like,
Jane the rapper.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.311
â™ª First things first,
I'm Sweet Lady Jane â™ª

12:27.355 --> 12:30.010
â™ª And I'm-a drop lyrics
so sick, they insane... â™ª

12:30.053 --> 12:32.708
This has just been
such a fun journey.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.190
Who are you?I'm Bachelorette Jane.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.713
It's like an actor's playground.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.194
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,
she pulls out

12:40.237 --> 12:42.370
the belly bump!RODRIGUEZ: So much to do,
so much to play,

12:42.413 --> 12:45.634
so many characters to be. XIOMARA:
There's nothing wrong

12:45.677 --> 12:48.071
with casual sex.
I just had sex in the bathroom.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.948
It's been so incredible.
What an incredible journey

12:54.991 --> 12:56.253
Xiomara has had.

12:56.297 --> 12:57.559
What do you think?

12:57.602 --> 12:59.343
In the beginning, the dynamics

12:59.387 --> 13:00.910
between Jane and

13:00.954 --> 13:02.999
Xiomara are more like

13:03.043 --> 13:06.437
Jane's the mom and Xiomara's
the daughter.

13:06.481 --> 13:07.830
I have to draw the line
somewhere,

13:07.874 --> 13:09.353
and telling my mom
the ins and outs

13:09.397 --> 13:10.790
of my sex fantasy
is definitely crossing it.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.053
Did you say
"ins and outs"?

13:13.096 --> 13:15.011
Seriously?

13:15.055 --> 13:16.752
To being a conscientious mom.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.059
You get to be selfish now.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.235
You don't have to take
care of anyone else.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.759
Just yourself, okay?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.108
When I think about Xo and Jane,
I just think

13:25.152 --> 13:27.545
about how much I hope
that I could be a mother

13:27.589 --> 13:28.938
like Xo has been to Jane.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.722
When he opens his mouth,

13:30.766 --> 13:33.116
will you stuff my boob in it
like it's a hamburger?

13:33.160 --> 13:34.596
Honey, I am all over it.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.598
GROBGLAS:
I don't think

13:36.641 --> 13:39.079
of these characters necessarily
as strong characters.

13:39.122 --> 13:42.212
I just think of them as...
as women.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.258
PETRA:
I do feel better knowing

13:44.301 --> 13:46.216
you've suffered a little. What?

13:46.260 --> 13:47.261
I like honesty.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.611
So do I.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.047
They're unbelievably
accomplished--

13:51.091 --> 13:52.788
all in their own ways-- women.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.790
Oh, please. Own your hotness.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.401
Mm. Amen. That's what
I've been telling her.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.186
You know, this is what
my mother taught me.

13:59.229 --> 14:01.623
You don't need to be married
in order to be accomplished and

14:01.666 --> 14:03.668
to be happy.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.716
GROBGLAS:
It shows women breaking down,

14:07.759 --> 14:10.632
being emotional, being strong,
being bosses, being mothers.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.897
What?

14:20.990 --> 14:22.252
GROBGLAS:
And none of this means that

14:22.296 --> 14:23.732
they're more or less strong.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.865
It's just... real.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.127
You just push people
too far, Petra.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.563
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I'll say.

14:28.606 --> 14:31.261
JANE:
And at a certain point,

14:31.305 --> 14:33.002
they can't come back anymore.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.395
GROBGLAS:
There are so many things

14:34.438 --> 14:36.266
with Petra that I might not
do the same things.

14:36.310 --> 14:37.964
I might not make
the same choices she makes.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.922
You can't cancel brunch.
Have a seat, girls.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.793
Um... what's going on?

14:41.837 --> 14:43.230
GROBGLAS:
But I always respected her.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.361
I'm here to cook

14:44.405 --> 14:45.754
everyone a traditional
Czech breakfast.

14:45.797 --> 14:48.365
Alba, any food
intolerances?

14:48.409 --> 14:49.845
Petra's experience
in becoming a mother,

14:49.889 --> 14:51.629
from the...
how she got pregnant.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.240
Mm.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.764
A sandwich and the
extra turkey baster?

14:55.807 --> 14:58.114
Perfect. Thank you.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.290
I still get turkey basters
as gifts.

15:00.334 --> 15:03.163
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Petra decided... to go for it.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.252
GROBGLAS:
She has, in her own way,

15:05.295 --> 15:07.080
fought for herself
and her family

15:07.123 --> 15:08.864
and the people
she cares about

15:08.908 --> 15:10.170
from the beginning.

15:10.213 --> 15:13.956
You protect everyone
around you like a dragon.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.131
BALDONI:
That's really who she's been.

15:15.175 --> 15:16.785
But it comes from love.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.178
Really?

15:18.221 --> 15:20.049
That's how I see you.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.445
Well, this year is easy.

15:24.488 --> 15:28.014
I'm thankful for Mateo,
all day, every day.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.493
What's interesting
about our show

15:29.537 --> 15:31.669
and also the way
that I viewed family is

15:31.713 --> 15:33.149
that family doesn't always
mean blood.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.676
Family is...

15:38.720 --> 15:40.504
the people you choose to keep.

15:40.548 --> 15:41.984
Rafael?

15:42.028 --> 15:46.206
This. I'm grateful
for all of it.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.686
That must be Petra.

15:48.730 --> 15:51.167
That's one of the themes
of our show is you get to see

15:51.211 --> 15:52.908
that family looks like a lot
of different things.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.736
You know what? Come in,

15:54.779 --> 15:56.651
since you're here
and there's so much food.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.522
Yeah, okay.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.611
Thank you.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.621
I'm done protecting
Britney Spears!

16:10.665 --> 16:11.448
Ideally, Ricky Martin.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.363
I mean it, Teri Hatcher!

16:13.407 --> 16:16.366
Antonio Banderas.
Ah.

16:16.410 --> 16:17.802
Just the other day, I was
telling Gloria Estefan

16:17.846 --> 16:19.239
what a shameless name-dropper
Catalina is.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.545
Did you tell Oprah, too?No, just Gayle.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.721
CAMIL: That's a Rogelio thing,
because Rogelio's

16:23.765 --> 16:25.245
a natural name-dropper.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.247
I left word with
the U.N. ambassador

16:27.290 --> 16:28.944
and Gloria Estefan.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.555
One of them will
stop the deportation.

16:31.599 --> 16:34.732
So Gloria-- she turned out to be
a huge fan of the show.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.908
She said
when that episode aired,

16:36.952 --> 16:38.649
and he dropped her name...

16:38.693 --> 16:39.781
Oh, my God.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.261
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, my God!

16:41.304 --> 16:43.219
NAVEDO: ...her and Emilio
were watching.

16:43.263 --> 16:44.960
He was like, "Gloria!

16:45.004 --> 16:47.571
Gloria, they said your name!"

16:47.615 --> 16:49.486
So, pretty cool.

16:49.530 --> 16:52.446
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow. Just look at her.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.058
NAVEDO:
The name-dropping was so good.

16:56.102 --> 17:00.323
And then to back it up
with the real star, like...

17:00.367 --> 17:03.718
The one and only... Bruno Mars!

17:03.761 --> 17:05.502
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wait. What?!

17:05.546 --> 17:07.548
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

17:07.591 --> 17:09.071
CAMIL:
Not just any "Bruno,"

17:09.115 --> 17:10.420
but Bruno Mars.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.988
Please welcome back
River Fields.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.555
Stop.

17:14.598 --> 17:18.298
Yes. Yes.
Stop bowing, Sharon Osbourne.

17:18.341 --> 17:19.473
Brooke Shields!
Oh, my God!

17:19.516 --> 17:21.040
She's a legend.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.955
Bananas Foster, madam.Allow me.

17:25.914 --> 17:30.049
Oh! My eyebrows.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.398
All the fights
with Brooke Shields

17:31.441 --> 17:33.095
are super funny.

17:33.139 --> 17:36.316
How dare you.
How dare you! How dare... you!

17:36.359 --> 17:38.274
Our minds were all blown
when Britney showed up.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.972
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.365
GROBGLAS :
That was, like,

17:42.409 --> 17:44.802
oh! I don't think
I was even working that day.

17:44.846 --> 17:45.847
I just came to see Britney.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.414
Britney Spears, stop!

17:47.457 --> 17:49.720
CAMIL:
Who can forget

17:49.764 --> 17:51.592
the Britney Spears feud?

17:51.635 --> 17:54.508
Ro, Ro...Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it right this minute!

17:54.551 --> 17:56.379
These are like major,
incredible...

17:56.423 --> 17:59.730
We've had Juanes
and David Bisbal.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.776
You look just like
Paulina Rubio.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.125
I get that a lot.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.083
Rosario Dawson.

18:04.126 --> 18:04.953
You're relentless.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.259
Without a doubt.

18:06.302 --> 18:07.390
Justina Machado.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.613
Puerto Rican, also.
Hello. Thank you.

18:12.656 --> 18:15.616
I can't believe you broadcast
my cervix to the entire world.

18:15.659 --> 18:18.836
Only three million people
watch my feed.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.621
Working with Justina Machado
was amazing.

18:20.664 --> 18:23.014
I agreed to sign the contract
with a clear understanding...

18:24.190 --> 18:26.409
You are clinically insane!

18:26.453 --> 18:28.150
And having directors
like Eva Longoria...

18:28.194 --> 18:30.457
Water.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.328
Amazing.

18:32.372 --> 18:33.416
Man, have we been lucky.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.244
But you're going to love the CW.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.289
I don't even know
what channel that is.

18:36.332 --> 18:37.290
And I don't want

18:37.333 --> 18:38.465
to do business with you again.

18:38.508 --> 18:39.466
Rita Moreno?

18:39.509 --> 18:43.948
Oh, my beautiful granddaughter.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.167
I was like, "Oh, my God.

18:45.211 --> 18:48.170
This is the real Anita,
everyone."

18:48.214 --> 18:51.826
â™ª It's another beautiful day
to be Rogelio. â™ª

18:51.869 --> 18:55.177
Rita Moreno, who is like God!
Oh, yes.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.701
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow, sheis good.

18:57.745 --> 19:00.791
The fact that these great big,
humongous celebrities,

19:00.835 --> 19:02.793
they like the show,
and they're willing to come

19:02.837 --> 19:04.230
and play with us
for a little bit,

19:04.273 --> 19:05.622
it means the world.

19:06.971 --> 19:09.974
We're really embracing
the telenovela roots,

19:10.018 --> 19:12.238
and exploiting all of the giant

19:12.281 --> 19:14.414
twists and turns
that you can take.

19:14.457 --> 19:17.330
You need to take a few
deep breaths, okay?

19:17.373 --> 19:21.116
I'm just so happy that
the wedding is finally here.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.553
So you jump from funerals
to weddings

19:23.597 --> 19:25.381
to happiness to tears.

19:25.425 --> 19:27.035
I left the car running
with the air-conditioner on

19:27.078 --> 19:28.906
so your makeup wouldn't
run from the heat.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.038
Aw, thanks, Dad.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.126
JANE: Aah! Turn it off!

19:31.170 --> 19:32.649
It's smoking.Oh, my God!

19:32.693 --> 19:34.651
Dad, do not panic.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.044
We always make a joke
out of it,

19:36.087 --> 19:37.741
because Jane can go
from, like, extreme laughter

19:37.785 --> 19:39.265
to, like, bawling
the next second.

19:39.308 --> 19:44.095
Yo, Michael,
te tomo a ti, Jane.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.315
RODRIGUEZ:
When you have great writing,

19:46.359 --> 19:47.577
it's not as difficult
of a challenge

19:47.621 --> 19:48.796
to play those beats.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.798
You fall right into it.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.408
Great job! You waited.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.193
Now go have sex, Jane.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.978
CHOIR:
â™ª Go have sex, Jane

19:57.021 --> 20:00.068
â™ª Go have sex.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.505
People enjoy that.

20:02.549 --> 20:03.767
We like our emotions to be
toyed with a little bit.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.205
I'm gonna go get
some ice for the champagne.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.859
Don't go anywhere. There's always a twist.

20:08.903 --> 20:09.860
And you want to see
what the twist is.

20:09.904 --> 20:10.992
You don't want to know.

20:11.035 --> 20:12.776
You know,
it's like magic, right?

20:12.820 --> 20:13.864
It's you.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.262
It takes you on a whole ride,

20:20.306 --> 20:22.221
And you can never really guess
what's gonna happen.

20:22.264 --> 20:26.660
You're okay.
You're really okay.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.444
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, if this were only
a romance novel,

20:28.488 --> 20:31.534
we could end here,
and they'd get their H.E.A.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.493
MENDEZ:
There are times when
I'm in the vocal booth,

20:33.536 --> 20:35.234
and I literally put my hand
on my heart

20:35.277 --> 20:37.236
before delivering certain
lines.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.498
Michael.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.500
I am so proud of you.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.415
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,
it should be noted

20:42.458 --> 20:44.199
that Jane would play
this moment

20:44.243 --> 20:48.116
over and over,
until it became a memory.

20:48.159 --> 20:50.597
DIER:
I got very emotional
my last day,

20:50.640 --> 20:52.642
when I was gonna die;
I cried.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.165
Because I felt like
I was losing a friend.

20:54.209 --> 20:55.950
MENDEZ:
When Michael died,

20:55.993 --> 20:57.212
it was a moment where

20:57.256 --> 20:59.693
I shed real tears.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.566
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

21:03.610 --> 21:06.569
I did say
Michael would love Jane

21:06.613 --> 21:08.136
until his dying breath.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.311
RODRIGUEZ:
Our love story...

21:09.355 --> 21:10.747
I think of Brett Dier

21:10.791 --> 21:13.620
and how much fun I had
working with him.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.060
It's a good show.

21:19.103 --> 21:22.716
Um, so, uh, when I think
about Michael and Jane,

21:22.759 --> 21:24.152
what a love story, man.

21:24.195 --> 21:25.675
What a beautiful love story.

21:28.025 --> 21:31.464
How long are you gonna keep
tucking me in? Hmm?

21:35.032 --> 21:36.077
COLL:
So, Alba,

21:36.120 --> 21:39.385
she has done extremely well

21:39.428 --> 21:41.822
considering
that she was widowed

21:41.865 --> 21:44.477
and that she had to be
the only support

21:44.520 --> 21:45.869
of her household.

21:48.002 --> 21:50.265
One of my favorite moments
for my character

21:50.309 --> 21:53.312
is after we have sex.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.183
Alba.

21:55.226 --> 21:57.490
You look...

21:59.230 --> 22:00.928
But I love the fact
that, you know,

22:00.971 --> 22:03.278
you're so prude
and so righteous,

22:03.322 --> 22:05.019
and finally she gets married,

22:05.062 --> 22:06.673
and then we have that scene

22:06.716 --> 22:08.109
where they both pop out of bed.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.029
That's one
of my favorite moments for Alba.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.031
At least she got some, you know.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.515
When she got here
to the country,

22:22.558 --> 22:24.778
I don't think
that she ever even imagined

22:24.821 --> 22:27.520
that it would get to be
to this point.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.043
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You'll recall Alba

22:29.086 --> 22:31.219
had recently decided
to pursue her green card.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.307
NAVEDO:
I did love,

22:32.351 --> 22:35.136
uh, the immigration story line.

22:35.179 --> 22:38.139
It really puts a human face

22:38.182 --> 22:41.098
on this idea of immigration.

22:44.928 --> 22:47.061
Mommy.

22:47.104 --> 22:50.151
COLL:
I realize the political
importance that it had

22:50.194 --> 22:52.240
in terms of the situation that,

22:52.283 --> 22:54.721
uh, we're facing
in the United States right now.

22:54.764 --> 22:58.768
I spent so many years

22:58.812 --> 23:03.425
worrying about being separated
from all of you.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.035
COLL:
I never understood

23:05.079 --> 23:07.342
what it meant, but now
I understand what it means,

23:07.386 --> 23:10.432
you know, for all the immigrants
that work so hard.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.478
ALBA: And I am
so grateful

23:12.521 --> 23:13.696
that I will never

23:13.740 --> 23:18.788
have to worry about that again.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.496
Am I being practical or brave?

23:30.539 --> 23:33.063
Practical.
I'm a teacher.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.978
I think the show deals with
a lot of interesting aspects

23:35.022 --> 23:36.632
of what it means to be a hero.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.460
Brave.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.680
I'm a writer?

23:40.723 --> 23:43.030
: I have never
said that out loud before.

23:43.073 --> 23:48.078
It takes the everyday person
and it turns her into a hero.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.038
But I can't stand there

23:51.081 --> 23:52.953
and read a book about Michael

23:52.996 --> 23:54.520
in front of a bunch

23:54.563 --> 23:56.478
of strangers.

23:56.522 --> 23:59.612
I wouldn't be sitting here today
if I let fear stop me,

23:59.655 --> 24:02.136
and Jane wouldn't be where she
is if she let fear stop her.

24:02.179 --> 24:05.139
Chapter one.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.576
BALDONI:
I just believe that everybody
who's been on our screen

24:07.620 --> 24:08.751
has had a chance
to play the hero.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.013
You are on a roll, Jane.

24:10.057 --> 24:12.581
Let's bet on your dream now.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.365
Mine will come.

24:14.409 --> 24:16.846
BALDONI:
Jennie wrote Rafael

24:16.890 --> 24:19.327
as an underdog, almost.

24:19.370 --> 24:24.375
You can trust me with whatever
you're feeling or thinking

24:24.419 --> 24:25.812
because I love you.

24:25.855 --> 24:27.596
I do. Because he had everything

24:27.640 --> 24:29.163
going against him,

24:29.206 --> 24:31.339
in terms of becoming
the, the hero,

24:31.382 --> 24:32.993
the guy that the audience would

24:33.036 --> 24:34.385
really want Jane to be with.

24:34.429 --> 24:37.388
I love you. I love you.

24:37.432 --> 24:40.522
And through this process
of him falling in love,

24:40.566 --> 24:43.133
he made
a pretty large transformation.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.832
Becoming a father, learning
what selflessness was like,

24:45.875 --> 24:48.138
meeting the Villanuevas and
seeing this tight-knit family.

24:48.182 --> 24:49.488
RAFAEL:
I was hoping

24:49.531 --> 24:51.794
to get your blessing first.

24:51.838 --> 24:53.709
Of course you have my blessing.

24:53.753 --> 24:56.669
All of the different things
that Rafael was exposed to,

24:56.712 --> 24:58.192
he started to change.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.632
GROBGLAS: I think the male characters are more interesting

25:03.676 --> 25:05.678
because of the women
around them as well.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.984
And I think that is true
in life.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.859
NAVEDO:
I love that Xo and Ro

25:12.902 --> 25:15.731
always manage
to find each other.

25:15.775 --> 25:17.603
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
I'm going to faint.

25:17.646 --> 25:20.388
For Rogelio,
Xiomara is the love of his life.

25:20.431 --> 25:23.086
Who knew, when we first said
"I love you" on Beach Day...

25:23.130 --> 25:24.827
I love you, Xiomara.

25:24.871 --> 25:26.829
I love you, too, Rogelio.

25:26.873 --> 25:28.527
...that we'd end up here?

25:28.570 --> 25:30.572
They go through ups and downs,

25:30.616 --> 25:31.747
rocky moments
in their relationship.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.054
Life is beautiful
and hard,

25:34.097 --> 25:36.491
and the only thing
I know for sure

25:36.535 --> 25:40.147
is that I want to go
through it all with you.

25:40.190 --> 25:44.064
There really truly is
a love that can't be broken.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.501
I had Botox this morning,

25:46.545 --> 25:49.330
so the tears
are struggling to fall,

25:49.373 --> 25:51.158
but I feel them.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.594
They're meant to be together.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.640
XIOMARA:
Rogelio de la Vega,

25:54.683 --> 25:56.163
will you marry me?

25:56.206 --> 25:58.382
Of course I will.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.689
CAMIL:
Our romance is a really big

26:00.733 --> 26:04.084
and powerful and deep romance.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.086
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
It should be noted
that on the day

26:06.129 --> 26:08.567
of Xiomara Gloriana
Villanueva's wedding,

26:08.610 --> 26:11.657
the power was out,
her dress was ruined,

26:11.700 --> 26:14.224
but it was still
completely magical.

26:14.268 --> 26:15.748
NAVEDO:
Weddings are awesome.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.010
I loved my wedding.

26:17.053 --> 26:18.098
In the middle of a hurricane.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.101
I got to wear
a little princess crown,

26:21.144 --> 26:22.929
like, makeshift dress

26:22.972 --> 26:24.887
inspired by the sea.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.196
RODRIGUEZ :
Lots of weddings.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.459
We do weddings well here.

26:31.502 --> 26:34.288
My parents are here today not
because they are meant to be,

26:34.331 --> 26:36.464
but because they chose
each other.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.945
CAMIL:
You don't need a big wedding
to profess your love.

26:38.988 --> 26:40.599
You just need
the feelings there,

26:40.642 --> 26:41.904
connected with the heart.

26:41.948 --> 26:42.949
JANE:
I now pronounce you

26:42.992 --> 26:46.300
husband and wife.

26:46.343 --> 26:47.693
Dad, kiss Mom.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.304
Yeah.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.742
Jane the Virginis about love.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.744
Love for oneself,

26:55.788 --> 26:58.225
and love for others.

26:58.268 --> 27:00.836
RODRIGUEZ:
I think the heart
ofJane the Virgin

27:00.880 --> 27:02.533
is joy.

27:02.577 --> 27:05.972
We just wanted to bring joy
into people's life.

27:06.015 --> 27:08.539
Thanks for that, Dad.
I love you.

27:08.583 --> 27:09.976
Thank God. I love you, too.

27:10.019 --> 27:12.500
CAMIL:
It's about love,

27:12.543 --> 27:14.023
challenges that human beings

27:14.067 --> 27:16.373
have to face.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.419
I think it's real,
and it's right,

27:18.462 --> 27:21.378
and we should tell our family
that we're together.

27:22.858 --> 27:25.905
BALDONI:
It puts forward the idea that

27:25.948 --> 27:30.170
positive choice
and, um, good people can win.

27:30.213 --> 27:31.388
Share your feelings.

27:33.434 --> 27:35.262
BALDONI:
And it's about
how we treat each other,

27:35.305 --> 27:36.698
at the end of the day.

27:36.742 --> 27:42.008
I'm... just... a little hurt.

27:42.051 --> 27:43.096
GROBGLAS:
The heart of the show

27:43.139 --> 27:46.708
is relationships between women.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.754
Here's how I feel:

27:48.797 --> 27:52.235
I didn't grow up with a sister,

27:52.279 --> 27:55.195
but I feel like I have one now.

27:55.238 --> 27:56.849
GROBGLAS:
I really feel like
that's where the heart

27:56.892 --> 27:58.415
pulses.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.378
Me, too.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.990
Yeah.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.174
Oh, please.
Don't be so dramatic.

28:18.218 --> 28:21.395
If you knew anything
about telenovelas,

28:21.438 --> 28:26.879
you'd know that everything
is supposed to be dramatic.

28:30.012 --> 28:32.145
We pay homage to telenovelas,

28:32.188 --> 28:34.625
which are
so incredibly important

28:34.669 --> 28:36.453
in the Latin-American community.

28:36.497 --> 28:37.846
NAVEDO:
My grandmother,
being from Puerto Rico,

28:37.890 --> 28:39.718
she always
had telenovelas on

28:39.761 --> 28:41.458
and, and she was like,
"Come on,ven aquÃ­,

28:41.502 --> 28:44.374
ven aquÃ­, vamos a mirar
la telenovela. Vamos, vamos."

28:44.418 --> 28:46.246
YOUNG JANE:
I just don't know
if I can stomach

28:46.289 --> 28:48.117
all the ups and downs.Then don't watch.

28:48.161 --> 28:49.771
Of course I'm watching.

28:49.815 --> 28:52.600
They love the novelas,
and they love the twists

28:52.643 --> 28:54.036
and turns.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.648
Don't look so surprised.

28:57.692 --> 29:01.478
You know ours is the greatest
love story ever told.

29:01.522 --> 29:04.655
What happens is this:
in Spanish, the telenovela style

29:04.699 --> 29:08.311
of acting is different
from what we're doing.

29:08.355 --> 29:10.792
I've always loved you.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.620
Why are you talking
in that creepy voice?

29:12.663 --> 29:14.665
It wasn't
supposed to be creepy,

29:14.709 --> 29:16.276
it was supposed to be sexy.

29:16.319 --> 29:18.800
But in terms of all the things
that happen,

29:18.844 --> 29:20.628
it is a telenovela.

29:20.671 --> 29:23.370
My long-lost sister. It's you.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.024
It's really you. Hi.

29:25.067 --> 29:27.504
GROBGLAS:
Oh, okay.

29:27.548 --> 29:29.332
I have a twin sister
showing up. Dope.

29:29.376 --> 29:32.335
Leaping lizards.She's a voracious eater,

29:32.379 --> 29:33.510
ANEZKA:
Do you think I-I
can bother you

29:33.554 --> 29:35.686
for a little bit more food?

29:35.730 --> 29:38.037
She yelps and scratches, she's
got issues with human contact.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.561
Hi.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.171
I'm like, "Great. I know
this person. This is my cat."

29:43.564 --> 29:45.348
I can't help it.
In the orphanage,

29:45.392 --> 29:47.655
you always had to look out for
your bread and your boyfriend.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.701
I was very sad
when she died, twice.

29:50.745 --> 29:53.400
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know. Straight out
of a telenovela, right?

29:53.443 --> 29:55.489
What I love so much is that it
is a love letter to telenovelas.

29:55.532 --> 29:57.839
It's bringing out the best parts of them, which are, like,

29:57.883 --> 29:59.841
the amazing,
larger-than-life story lines.

29:59.885 --> 30:02.539
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Surprise.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.367
Anything can happen.Michael?

30:04.411 --> 30:06.892
I go by Jason now.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.850
I come back from the dead,
I've got amnesia.

30:08.894 --> 30:11.679
You don't remember me?No, ma'am.

30:11.722 --> 30:13.376
DIER:
You can just pretty much
throw anything

30:13.420 --> 30:15.204
at this show and it will work

30:15.248 --> 30:17.554
because the world accepts it.

30:17.598 --> 30:18.773
Hi, there.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.688
Yes.

30:20.731 --> 30:23.560
It is me.DIER: He has no idea
who anyone was,

30:23.604 --> 30:25.867
so that would be
really difficult,

30:25.911 --> 30:27.260
having everyone go,
"Hi, how are you?"

30:27.303 --> 30:28.870
and "Oh, oh, my God,"
and then him being like,

30:28.914 --> 30:30.872
"I don't know any of you."How do we know each other?

30:30.916 --> 30:33.353
Well, we are best friends.

30:33.396 --> 30:37.879
And of course,
I am Rogelio de la Vega.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.141
DIER:
That was funny.

30:39.185 --> 30:40.273
I think he was also
trying to crack me up

30:40.316 --> 30:42.362
while we were doing it
in the scene.

30:42.405 --> 30:44.407
Rogelio de la Vega.

30:44.451 --> 30:46.105
CAMIL:
I love the bromance,
and I love the fact

30:46.148 --> 30:47.193
that Jennie went there.

30:47.236 --> 30:48.716
I had no idea
they were best friends.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.546
Because it's, it's so funny.

30:52.589 --> 30:55.418
All righty, then.

30:55.462 --> 30:58.073
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.
Brilliant.Yeah...

30:58.117 --> 30:59.770
CAMIL:
What I love the most about

30:59.814 --> 31:03.165
Rogelio de la Vega is that
he's a well-balanced,

31:03.209 --> 31:05.037
well-rounded character.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.690
So he can make you laugh,

31:06.734 --> 31:09.084
but you can also connect
via the heart with him.

31:09.128 --> 31:10.433
Xiomara, what is it?

31:10.477 --> 31:12.783
I have something to tell you.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.004
The biopsy
came back positive.

31:16.048 --> 31:18.702
I have breast cancer.

31:18.746 --> 31:21.749
NAVEDO:
It was really important to me
to portray it

31:21.792 --> 31:23.533
in the most honest way
that I could,

31:23.577 --> 31:25.187
without being melodramatic.

31:25.231 --> 31:27.233
Chemo hasn't
slowed you down at all.

31:27.276 --> 31:28.234
I know, right?

31:28.277 --> 31:29.975
I really do feel good.

31:30.018 --> 31:32.020
The heart and the dedication
she put behind it

31:32.064 --> 31:33.326
was not easy.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.416
NAVEDO:
She's dealing with cancer,

31:36.459 --> 31:38.505
and being
stripped down of...

31:38.548 --> 31:42.465
that Latina beauty sexiness.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.946
I wish there was more
that I could do for you.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.644
Distract me.
Keep talking.

31:47.688 --> 31:49.908
NAVEDO: Then getting down to bare bones of being human;

31:49.951 --> 31:52.736
oh, God, I so loved playing that

31:52.780 --> 31:54.129
whole cancer storyline.

31:54.173 --> 31:55.522
I thought once
chemo was over,

31:55.565 --> 31:57.828
I'd put it in
the rearview mirror

31:57.872 --> 31:59.569
and leave it behind.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.136
But it doesn't work like that.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.922
NAVEDO:
I was very proud to do it, and

32:03.965 --> 32:08.100
very happy about the response
that I received, so...

32:08.143 --> 32:09.144
Thanks.

32:09.188 --> 32:12.495
Mm.

32:12.539 --> 32:15.324
What I love about
Alba and Xiomara is their

32:15.368 --> 32:16.673
relationship grew.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.327
Thanks for coming.

32:20.373 --> 32:23.158
We have grown closer
as a mother and daughter

32:23.202 --> 32:25.856
in understanding
each other better.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.033
I just got a little scared,
you know?

32:32.559 --> 32:35.301
NAVEDO:
For example, me understanding
what my mom's reasons were

32:35.344 --> 32:37.694
for being the way she was,
when we find out

32:37.738 --> 32:39.827
how she losther virginity.

32:39.870 --> 32:42.525
With a guy who wasn't Dad?!

32:42.569 --> 32:45.659
And how she, you know,
kept that a secret...

32:45.702 --> 32:47.878
You're such a hypocrite!

32:50.577 --> 32:53.362
How I felt judged by her
all those years.

32:53.406 --> 32:56.800
I am just a normalwoman
who enjoys having sex,

32:56.844 --> 32:59.020
and you have made me
feel like crap about it

32:59.064 --> 33:00.456
my entire life!

33:00.500 --> 33:01.631
NAVEDO:
And I think that helped

33:01.675 --> 33:03.285
create a bond between us.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.985
NAVEDO: We were finally able
to be honest

33:07.028 --> 33:08.203
about everything.

33:10.858 --> 33:12.599
Thanks, Ma.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.383
COLL:
We're taught as

33:14.427 --> 33:17.038
females to be competitive
with each other,

33:17.082 --> 33:18.561
to not trust...

33:18.605 --> 33:21.956
...move on to the next phase,
you know? Publishing.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.436
In this family, we trust.

33:28.093 --> 33:29.398
COLL:
That front porch has become

33:29.442 --> 33:31.444
like a symbol
for many people...

33:31.487 --> 33:32.662
doing that kind of ritual.

33:32.706 --> 33:35.143
I'm really so happy.

33:35.187 --> 33:37.145
Ma?

33:37.189 --> 33:38.668
NAVEDO:
The porch itself

33:38.712 --> 33:41.106
helps with
the, the crying scenes.

33:41.149 --> 33:43.934
We call it the "porch of tears."

33:43.978 --> 33:46.285
I'm supposed to be
in Honolulu right now,

33:46.328 --> 33:50.071
sucking down Mai Tais
and having honeymoon sex!

33:50.115 --> 33:52.334
It's, uh, coming to terms
with things in life.

33:52.378 --> 33:53.857
That totally sucks.

33:53.901 --> 33:55.163
Right?
SÃ­.

33:55.207 --> 33:56.382
"We'll have a porch scene..."

33:56.425 --> 33:59.254
Oh, okay.
We'll be crying in this one.

34:02.431 --> 34:05.956
If you try to set the same scene
in the living room, let's say,

34:06.000 --> 34:09.395
those tears are gonna be
a little harder to achieve

34:09.438 --> 34:11.353
than when we sit on
the porch of tears.

34:13.399 --> 34:15.662
I'm heartbroken about Rafael
and confused about Michael.

34:15.705 --> 34:16.880
Ma, what's wrong?

34:16.924 --> 34:19.057
Because that's just what
it's for.

34:19.100 --> 34:22.538
: I don't want to have
sex, and I love having sex.

34:27.369 --> 34:28.762
Ma?!

34:28.805 --> 34:30.111
RODRIGUEZ:
They're my family.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.200
You know, Jane is
in love with her family.

34:32.244 --> 34:35.334
And she respects them.
Uh, and so do I.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.987
I love them.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.213
I thought I had a crazy life,
but yours...

34:45.257 --> 34:47.650
You don't know
the half of it.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.652
GROBGLAS:
I can't tell you enough how

34:49.696 --> 34:52.699
powerful it is
being on a show that

34:52.742 --> 34:54.266
means so much to so many people.

34:54.309 --> 34:55.832
Not just us, the people behind,

34:55.876 --> 34:57.573
but our fans.What makes you think

34:57.617 --> 34:59.227
I haven't been
with a woman?
Have you?

34:59.271 --> 35:02.491
Yes.I'm also your lawyer.

35:02.535 --> 35:05.277
That wouldn't be the
first line you've crossed.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.367
GROBGLAS:
The immense amount of love

35:08.410 --> 35:11.892
and wonderful messages
that I'm getting personally,

35:11.935 --> 35:14.721
with mostly women who are

35:14.764 --> 35:17.593
looking at the Petra
and JR relationship.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.508
I want to be
serious with you.

35:19.552 --> 35:21.597
I knew you'd
say it first.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.425
GROBGLAS:
To be part of something
that has that kind of

35:23.469 --> 35:25.906
a powerful impact
on people's lives is--

35:25.949 --> 35:27.734
I have no words
to even describe it.

35:27.777 --> 35:28.909
I've never felt
about anyone

35:28.952 --> 35:30.867
the way I feel
when I'm with you.

35:30.911 --> 35:33.870
And I think I just quoted
Dirty Dancing,

35:33.914 --> 35:36.134
but that's the kind of
cheesy thing you make me do.

35:36.177 --> 35:37.744
I'm unbelievably grateful.

35:37.787 --> 35:41.443
I happen to love
Dirty Dancing.

35:43.924 --> 35:45.230
So it's-it's made the biggest
impact on my life.

35:45.273 --> 35:46.970
You cornered JR
in an elevator and said

35:47.014 --> 35:48.537
she's really
important to me?

35:48.581 --> 35:49.843
I didn't say
that, exactly.

35:49.886 --> 35:50.931
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Actually, verbatim.

35:50.974 --> 35:53.063
GROBGLAS:
Jane definitely

35:53.107 --> 35:54.761
worked her way
against all the odds

35:54.804 --> 35:57.198
into Petra's heart. Everyone's not going
to love you!

35:57.242 --> 35:58.765
That is not what
this is about.Then what is it about?

35:58.808 --> 36:00.941
You,okay?
It's about you,

36:00.984 --> 36:02.072
because I love you.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.291
RODRIGUEZ:
That evolution

36:03.335 --> 36:04.727
has been remarkable.

36:04.771 --> 36:07.121
And I don't want anything
to come in the way

36:07.165 --> 36:08.775
of our family because
we've worked too hard.

36:08.818 --> 36:13.258
And, like I said...
I love you.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.825
I think their relationship
was handled beautifully.

36:15.869 --> 36:18.524
W-Well, thank you.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.961
I ap-appreciate
your explanation.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.789
It's not black and white.
It's just, there's moments.

36:22.832 --> 36:23.790
And Petra's still guarded.

36:23.833 --> 36:25.139
You have to
say it back.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.967
I don't want to.Petra...

36:27.010 --> 36:28.664
Fine.

36:28.708 --> 36:31.667
I love you, too.

36:31.711 --> 36:32.973
What I loved about that
moment is,

36:33.016 --> 36:36.237
Jane comes around,
and then hugs Petra...

36:36.281 --> 36:37.978
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw...

36:38.021 --> 36:40.894
And, I don't know why,
I had to give her a little

36:40.937 --> 36:43.592
kiss on the head
before running away.

36:43.636 --> 36:44.637
RODRIGUEZ:
That love story has been,

36:44.680 --> 36:45.942
to me, such a strong

36:45.986 --> 36:47.205
relationship of friendship

36:47.248 --> 36:49.076
to project. PETRA: Jane!

36:49.119 --> 36:50.643
RODRIGUEZ:
To get to a space of just

36:50.686 --> 36:53.123
such transparency and love.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.124
What's wrong? S-Sit.

36:55.430 --> 36:56.823
GROBGLAS:
That scene was beautiful.

36:56.866 --> 36:58.172
And I felt like it feels natural
at this point

36:58.216 --> 36:59.608
for Petra to go crawling to Jane

36:59.652 --> 37:01.262
when she's--
when she feels broken.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.308
: Can I
use this rag?

37:03.351 --> 37:05.832
W-- That-- My sweatshirt-- Mm...

37:05.875 --> 37:07.007
Like, who else?

37:07.050 --> 37:09.183
She broke up with me.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.404
And I feel like someone
cut out a piece of my heart.

37:12.447 --> 37:14.841
Oh, Petra...

37:14.884 --> 37:17.278
That scene, like, women,
sisterhood, friendship,

37:17.322 --> 37:19.280
and the way it could

37:19.324 --> 37:21.151
evolve into
something beautiful.

37:21.195 --> 37:23.328
Thank you for
letting me stay here.

37:23.371 --> 37:26.635
That's what sisters
are for.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.289
And now they technically
areactually a family,

37:28.333 --> 37:30.509
because, um, they have
the same baby daddy.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.816
Hey! You ready for
karate, bud?

37:33.860 --> 37:35.514
Mwah.

37:35.557 --> 37:37.559
Mwah.

37:38.908 --> 37:40.301
RODRIGUEZ:
Rafael and Jane
are complicated.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.521
They're, you know,
the parents of Mateo...

37:42.564 --> 37:46.089
Sorry, I-I don't know
what that was.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.441
They've gone through
this insane journey

37:49.484 --> 37:50.877
of back and forth

37:50.920 --> 37:52.531
and push and pull...

37:52.574 --> 37:54.359
It's love.BALDONI:
It's a testament to

37:54.402 --> 37:55.795
the love that these two have

37:55.838 --> 37:57.579
that they were willing
to overcome

37:57.623 --> 37:58.711
all of these obstacles.

37:58.754 --> 37:59.886
I love you.

37:59.929 --> 38:01.714
I've tried to stop,

38:01.757 --> 38:03.368
but I can't...

38:03.411 --> 38:04.934
and I don't
want to anymore.

38:04.978 --> 38:06.240
RODRIGUEZ:
So it resembles

38:06.284 --> 38:07.459
what life is.

38:07.502 --> 38:11.071
What a real-life love story
should be.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.383
RODRIGUEZ:
I really hope

38:18.426 --> 38:20.385
that fans feel full.

38:20.428 --> 38:21.734
I can't believe this!

38:21.777 --> 38:22.778
My heart feels like...

38:22.822 --> 38:24.127
It's glowing?

38:24.171 --> 38:25.651
RODRIGUEZ:
And they feel the closure

38:25.694 --> 38:28.741
that we all do
as we are creating this finale.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.133
I can't imagine it ending.

38:30.177 --> 38:31.613
We're in this
together, right?

38:31.657 --> 38:33.920
Yeah.GROBGLAS: I can't imagine

38:33.963 --> 38:37.140
all these characters
just ceasing to exist.

38:37.184 --> 38:39.404
I think the finale is

38:39.447 --> 38:42.581
a great culmination
of wrapping up

38:42.624 --> 38:45.105
the entire five seasons.

38:45.148 --> 38:46.672
I just want everyone
to be happy.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.413
'Cause it's been a stressful
five years for the characters.

38:48.456 --> 38:49.936
Poor things.

38:49.979 --> 38:52.678
Michael?Hi, Jane.

38:52.721 --> 38:53.766
CAMIL:
And I think that the finale

38:53.809 --> 38:55.420
will have happy endings.

38:55.463 --> 38:58.466
Of course, a happy ending
on Jane the Virgin

38:58.510 --> 39:00.294
might not be
a normal happy ending...

39:00.338 --> 39:04.124
Out of many... one.

39:04.167 --> 39:07.693
You are all part
of my journey.

39:07.736 --> 39:10.739
BALDONI:
I think what the fans
can expect is

39:10.783 --> 39:13.351
a very Jane the Virginending.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.876
JANE:
Tonight, it's...

39:16.919 --> 39:18.878
everything I'd ever dreamed.

39:18.921 --> 39:20.140
CAMIL:
The journey has been amazing.

39:20.183 --> 39:22.316
The journey has been
beyond belief.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.406
I love you, Jane.Oh, I love you, Dad.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.800
Five years went by real quick.It's a good-bye party.

39:27.843 --> 39:30.803
DIER:
It's been an amazing
experience.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.108
Janehas just been
really life-changing for me.

39:32.152 --> 39:33.893
These relationships that

39:33.936 --> 39:35.242
I'll hold in my heart forever.

39:35.285 --> 39:37.026
I'm so proud of you.

39:37.070 --> 39:38.811
It was groundbreaking
in my personal life.

39:38.854 --> 39:40.595
: I love you.: I love you, too.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.380
NAVEDO:
And really impacted

39:42.423 --> 39:44.207
my life in a positive way.

39:44.251 --> 39:45.470
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw, look.

39:45.513 --> 39:46.993
MENDEZ:
I get to see it as a fan.

39:47.036 --> 39:49.125
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
They're having all the feels.

39:49.169 --> 39:50.779
And I'm just so proud

39:50.823 --> 39:52.346
of everybody.You did it!

39:52.390 --> 39:54.522
GROBGLAS:
It was just something

39:54.566 --> 39:55.697
I never thought would happen

39:55.741 --> 39:57.699
for me.Wow, they're beautiful.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.048
Right? It's not just me.

39:59.092 --> 40:00.789
And it's completely changed
my life.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.748
It's been an emotional journey.

40:04.706 --> 40:06.099
To be somebody's mom

40:06.142 --> 40:08.144
and grandmother...

40:10.277 --> 40:11.931
Abuela.

40:11.974 --> 40:13.585
Five years,
a hundred episodes...

40:13.628 --> 40:17.197
Can I put into words
what this journey means to me?

40:17.240 --> 40:18.590
I can tell you this:

40:18.633 --> 40:20.113
It is the greatest thing
that ever

40:20.156 --> 40:21.462
happened to me.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.986
You're it for me. Forever.

40:24.030 --> 40:26.467
BALDONI:
Little did I know
what was coming.

40:26.511 --> 40:27.947
And it will forever
be one of the most

40:27.990 --> 40:30.906
beautiful experiences
I've ever had.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.430
It really was like
winning the lottery.

40:32.473 --> 40:36.129
It was the... biggest gift
anyone could have given me.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.523
Yay!

40:38.566 --> 40:40.481
: Jennie making me
her Jane changed my life.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.570
CAMIL: I think it's gonna be
one of those shows

40:42.614 --> 40:44.529
that it will never go away.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.487
Will you marry
us, Jane?

40:46.531 --> 40:48.663
I'd love to.

40:48.707 --> 40:49.969

be there for you
