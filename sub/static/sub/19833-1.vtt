18:33.656 --> 18:38.369
Not only do we know of this battle,
lord, we have risen because of it.

18:38.494 --> 18:42.581
And just days ago,
Alfred has sent his very own priest.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.876
You killed all the Danes
that ruled Eofervvic?

18:46.002 --> 18:49.255
We have. All those that did not flee.

18:51.882 --> 18:54.719
The holy city of Eofervvic welcomes you.

18:55.553 --> 19:00.182
We will give you food and shelter
and thanks, Lord Uhtred.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.812
God bless you.

19:11.027 --> 19:15.031
We take care of the horses
and then I find Alfred's priest.

19:17.575 --> 19:19.285
Huh.

19:19.785 --> 19:21.120
(GROANS)

19:22.538 --> 19:24.623
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

19:26.292 --> 19:27.918
MAN: Clear the way.

19:35.801 --> 19:38.512
BEOCCA: We carry it all, we must.

19:38.637 --> 19:42.058
But what guarantee do we have
that he will not steal Alfred's silver?

19:42.183 --> 19:45.102
BEOCCA: None, but that's the risk
we have to take.

19:45.227 --> 19:48.230
UHTRED: Have you been stealing
from Alfred, Father Beocca?

19:48.731 --> 19:51.400
Uhtred! Oh, my goodness, Uhtred!

19:51.525 --> 19:55.363
- (UHTRED LAUGHS)
- Wow! What a joy it is to see you.

19:55.488 --> 19:57.615
And for me to see your hairless head.

19:57.740 --> 19:58.783
(BOTH LAUGH)

19:58.908 --> 20:01.410
I have been praying
that our paths would cross!

20:01.535 --> 20:03.662
This is a sign. God's will.

20:04.330 --> 20:08.084
Brother Trew, this is the man
I have been speaking about.

20:08.209 --> 20:11.962
And here he is.
In our time of need, he is here.

20:13.255 --> 20:17.385
BEOCCA: We are travelling north
with Alfred's blessing and silver.

20:17.510 --> 20:22.681
It is a ransom to be paid to free
a slave, but he is no ordinary slave.

20:22.807 --> 20:25.267
This man is marked to become a king.

20:25.393 --> 20:27.603
- BROTHER TREW: Of Cumbraland.
- His name is Guthred.

20:28.354 --> 20:31.065
- A Dane?
- But a good man, a man of God.

20:32.066 --> 20:35.694
The spirit of Saint Cuthbert
has decreed that Guthred shall be king.

20:35.820 --> 20:38.489
- A prophecy.
- Oh, my good lord.

20:38.614 --> 20:41.534
He appeared in a dream
to the Abbot Eadred of Cumbraland.

20:41.659 --> 20:44.412
He named Guthred as king
of both Saxons and Danes.

20:46.622 --> 20:48.165
How many men is that?

20:48.290 --> 20:49.750
Hundreds. Thousands, perhaps.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.169
- Warriors?
- BROTHER TREW: Some, yes.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.337
Of course.

20:56.006 --> 21:01.095
Alfred would not be content with this
man being solely king of Cumbraland.

21:01.220 --> 21:04.056
Well, yes, Alfred would wish
for Guthred's influence

21:04.181 --> 21:06.225
to spread across
the whole of Northumbria.

21:06.350 --> 21:08.686
Including here, in Eofervvic.

21:10.187 --> 21:13.774
Come with us. Help us to free Guthred,

21:13.899 --> 21:15.860
protect the ransom
until it is delivered,

21:15.985 --> 21:18.154
and I'm sure there will be a reward.

21:18.279 --> 21:20.823
Your bargain is with whom?

21:20.948 --> 21:22.491
BROTHER TREW: A slave-master.

21:22.616 --> 21:25.035
The village in which we are meeting
sits on land

21:25.161 --> 21:27.204
that belongs to someone from your past.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.956
Kjartan.

21:33.085 --> 21:36.672
Kjartan's land
will be full of men, warriors?

21:36.839 --> 21:38.883
HALIG: Father,
who's protected you so far?

21:39.008 --> 21:40.217
Do you have no guard?

21:40.342 --> 21:43.762
We have gathered a group of sickly men
who suffer with the white riff.

21:43.888 --> 21:45.473
Leprosy is a terrible curse.

21:45.598 --> 21:49.435
Put these poor creatures in a cart
and no man dare approach.

21:49.560 --> 21:53.981
No one can imagine the treasure
sitting beside the disease.

21:55.649 --> 22:00.196
Your king, Guthred.
Kjartan would be his enemy?

22:00.321 --> 22:03.240
BROTHER TREW: He would.
It was Kjartan's men killed his father.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.243
Guthred himself was captured
and sold as a slave.

22:08.704 --> 22:11.832
Then he would be prepared
to raise an army against Kjartan?

22:11.957 --> 22:13.834
He would be an ally, I'm sure.

22:13.959 --> 22:16.170
HILD: As I'm sure Uhtred is but one man.

22:16.295 --> 22:17.588
- Against many.
- BEOCCA: No.

22:17.713 --> 22:22.468
No, Uhtred is more than just one man.
And he is here for a reason.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.190
AELSWITH: I have come to wish you
goodnight, lord.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.489
Rest well.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.743
Sta)!-

22:51.497 --> 22:52.873
Sta)!-

23:11.016 --> 23:12.810
I have been thinking of Northumbria.

23:13.561 --> 23:16.063
Eofervvic is the great city of the north.

23:16.188 --> 23:19.108
To make it Saxon once again
would bring hope.

23:19.233 --> 23:20.943
It would be a beacon.

23:21.527 --> 23:23.028
Yes.

23:23.153 --> 23:28.867
A fortress from which all Danes
of the North could be challenged

23:28.993 --> 23:31.203
and England grows.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.277
Should you not be sleeping, lord?

24:04.445 --> 24:07.406
Yes, I should be sleeping.

24:13.954 --> 24:17.249
I've always intended to ask about
the amber on the hilt of your sword.

24:17.374 --> 24:21.211
- Hmm?
- ls it decoration or something more?

24:21.795 --> 24:24.548
It was given to me at my birth
by my father...

24:28.135 --> 24:29.637
to remind me of who I am.

24:33.724 --> 24:35.976
Who you are, lord...

24:37.561 --> 24:40.230
is defined by what you do,

24:40.356 --> 24:43.067
and what you have done
has given you reputation,

24:45.069 --> 24:46.820
but reputation is not a shield.

24:53.619 --> 24:56.288
I think Father Beocca asks too much.

25:02.127 --> 25:03.170
No.

25:06.173 --> 25:08.300
No, it's fate that I am here.

25:11.470 --> 25:16.266
It was fate you drenched me in water,
set us on our way.

25:20.020 --> 25:23.023
Kjartan will have men at this village,
no doubt.

25:24.692 --> 25:26.652
But he and his one-eyed son Sven,

25:26.777 --> 25:29.363
they murdered my family
and they must be faced.

25:32.074 --> 25:34.284
And I have my sister to find.

25:37.538 --> 25:39.790
Are you certain she still lives?

25:40.708 --> 25:42.793
Iseult was certain.

25:49.675 --> 25:51.260
Then you should sleep.

25:55.514 --> 25:56.557
Hild.

25:58.016 --> 26:00.728
I would sleep easier
lying next to a woman.

26:00.853 --> 26:02.938
(CHUCKLES)

26:03.272 --> 26:05.649
Shall I fetch another bucket, lord?

26:32.634 --> 26:34.261
We move!

26:59.203 --> 27:03.499
BEOCCA: Can you smell the northern sea,
boy, the Northumbrian air?

27:03.624 --> 27:06.043
UHTRED: I smell it
and I feel it, Father.

27:06.168 --> 27:08.253
- It feels like home.
- BEOCCA: That it does.

28:04.518 --> 28:06.979
I'd prefer you not to look at me, lord.

28:07.104 --> 28:10.148
Is it wrong that I look?
You have beauty.

28:10.274 --> 28:12.442
And you have an appetite
I do not wish to satisfy.

28:13.819 --> 28:16.113
I'm with you, lord,
because I'm safe with you.

28:20.325 --> 28:21.702
(GROWLS)

28:21.827 --> 28:23.871

28:23.996 --> 28:27.958

how to fight. Swordcraft.

28:28.083 --> 28:32.129
(UHTRED LAUGHS) Skill.
The Danes call it sword skill.

28:32.254 --> 28:35.757
Then I would like you
to teach me sword skill.

28:35.883 --> 28:38.719
To help you kill men who stare?

28:38.844 --> 28:42.931
No, lord, to protect myself
and those I care for.

Yourself included.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.525

28:56.486 --> 29:00.073
I give to you my heart, my soul,
and ask in return...

29:00.198 --> 29:03.535
We are being followed.
You are aware of this, I'm sure.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.913
- I am.
- We are?

29:06.914 --> 29:08.165
BY Whom?

29:08.290 --> 29:10.792
Men belonging to Kjartan.

29:11.710 --> 29:13.921
They are the shepherds,
we are the sheep.

29:14.046 --> 29:17.090
- HALIG: Then it is a trap?
- UHTRED: It is.

29:17.215 --> 29:19.843
You will enter the slave market alone.

29:19.968 --> 29:21.595
And then what happens? Death?

29:21.720 --> 29:24.723
I will follow.
I will be with the lepers.

29:24.848 --> 29:26.808
You will not be at our side?

29:26.934 --> 29:29.811
- No.
- Your purpose here is to protect us.

29:29.937 --> 29:31.563
Do they ride?

29:31.688 --> 29:35.025
You wish to know if the lepers can ride?
I have no idea.

29:35.150 --> 29:36.652
Beocca, what is this nonsense?

29:36.777 --> 29:39.863
If we are to save Guthred
and live to see him crowned king,

29:39.988 --> 29:42.449
then the slaver
and whoever sits with him must fear me.

29:42.574 --> 29:44.826
They will not bargain.

29:44.952 --> 29:47.746
And I am but one man, so...

29:47.871 --> 29:50.582
they must fear me
and I will choose how.

29:52.459 --> 29:55.671

I will need you to play your part.

Of course I have your man.

- No. You will give me the silver, now.

We shall leave this place

It would be for the best.

We are looking for Guthred

I am Guthred.

36:19.554 --> 36:21.306

- Lord?

LS it you?

36:25.602 --> 36:27.687
We have found you.

You have, it seems.

it is you I must thank for my freedom.

37:45.223 --> 37:47.058
I did not raise the ransom.

37:47.183 --> 37:50.728
A ransom was not paid.
It goes back to the Church.

37:51.729 --> 37:56.109
(CHUCKLES) Some coins should go to them,
the lepers.

37:56.234 --> 37:58.278
Without them, we'd all be dead.

37:58.403 --> 38:02.073
As I am apparently now king,
I shall see they are rewarded.

This is for you.

Aye, every Dane in the land
knows of Alfred, and while a slave,

38:19.424 --> 38:22.135
some of the men recently captured,
they spoke of Ethandun.

38:22.886 --> 38:27.056
They spoke of Uhtred,
how he broke a shield wall.

38:28.183 --> 38:30.768
You should pay a skald to write a song.

38:30.894 --> 38:32.979
Huh. I did that, in Mercia.

38:33.730 --> 38:37.275

- Last night I was still a slave.
- Build an army and I will command it,

but only if it's your intention to go
against all the lords of the North.

39:26.241 --> 39:29.827

He's dead. Invincible.

is back from the dead?

41:18.102 --> 41:20.355
Yes, lord, it seemed that way.

41:21.439 --> 41:24.359
Then you believe he was sent by Odin
to take my soul?

41:29.238 --> 41:33.284
Well, he arrived
with the priest and a ransom...

41:34.452 --> 41:36.621
- Yes, lord.
- But no silver was paid?

we find the lepers

- Sleep well.
- Sleep well, lady.

53:54.066 --> 53:58.445
Do not get overly drunk, lord,
for tomorrow you teach me sword skills.

53:58.570 --> 54:00.906
And maybe one day
I shall save your life.

54:06.286 --> 54:08.372
Your sister is pretty.

54:08.497 --> 54:11.917
Uhtred, I believe you would find
a goat in a skirt to be pretty.

54:12.668 --> 54:13.836
Goodnight.

54:16.880 --> 54:19.383
The cocksure long-haired fool
over there.

54:20.467 --> 54:22.719
Is he a danger?

54:23.387 --> 54:27.141
- To whom, Abbot?
- To each one of us and to our purpose.

54:28.475 --> 54:32.604
Although he lacks humility,
Uhtred is the reason we are alive.

54:32.729 --> 54:35.607
Ah, he gave you protection out of
the goodness of his heart, did he?

54:35.732 --> 54:39.445
What does he want with Cumbraland
and with our king?

54:41.280 --> 54:44.700
He wants Bebbanburg, his ancestral home.

54:45.409 --> 54:47.911
And it's in the king's gift to help him.

54:48.412 --> 54:51.623
Hm. He will need to be watched.

54:52.916 --> 54:54.251
He's a pretender,

54:54.376 --> 54:55.794
I'm sure.

55:08.182 --> 55:09.558
(GENTLY SNORES)

55:09.683 --> 55:10.934
(LOCK CLICKS)

55:27.409 --> 55:28.827
Please...

55:42.216 --> 55:44.259
You have men in Northumbria still?

55:45.594 --> 55:47.179
Some.

55:47.304 --> 55:50.015
Most have settled,
but they are mine to call upon,

55:50.140 --> 55:53.143
and I have men in East Anglia
with Earl Guthrum.

55:53.268 --> 55:54.978
His name is now Aethelstan.

55:55.103 --> 56:00.859
That may be his Christian name, lord,
but to us, he's Guthrum the Weak.

56:01.026 --> 56:03.445
To seek peace is not a weakness.

56:03.570 --> 56:06.031
The battle of Ethandun was ours to win.

56:06.156 --> 56:11.620
Only with peace can you build,
only with peace can a people grow.

56:11.745 --> 56:15.332
- Grow fat?
- Grow as one, Brida.

56:15.457 --> 56:18.835
It is true that in parts of the North,

56:18.961 --> 56:21.672
Saxon, Dane and Briton
now live side by side, do they not?

56:21.797 --> 56:25.676
Oh, they do,
but it is the Danes that rule.

56:26.718 --> 56:31.765
Though warlords must now look elsewhere
for war, to Ireland and Alba.

56:31.890 --> 56:34.268
War is how a man makes his wealth.

56:34.393 --> 56:35.894
ALFRED: Hmm, I disagree.

56:36.019 --> 56:39.147
War is how a man takes his wealth,
Earl Ragnar.

56:39.273 --> 56:41.525
It is the land and trade that makes it.

56:42.901 --> 56:46.321
And for the land and trade to flourish,
there must be peace.

56:47.990 --> 56:49.783
To be Viking is a way of life.

56:49.908 --> 56:52.035
To be Viking is a way to die.

56:53.287 --> 56:55.247
And there are many Danes, I believe,

56:55.372 --> 56:57.416
who want more from life than death.

56:57.541 --> 56:58.667
RAGNAR: Lord,

56:58.792 --> 57:04.047
you are never more alive than
when you sail a ship onto a new shore.

57:04.172 --> 57:06.133
Oh, on that we are agreed.

57:09.720 --> 57:11.013
SVEN: Father!

57:12.014 --> 57:13.682
Father.

57:13.807 --> 57:15.934
I have news of the slave, Guthred.

57:16.602 --> 57:19.187
He has been made a king, of Cumbraland.

57:20.814 --> 57:21.940
Fiske?

57:22.065 --> 57:24.735
It is true, lord,
we heard it from traders.

57:28.864 --> 57:32.242
- Where are these traders?
- We heard the same story three times,

57:32.367 --> 57:34.161
- five times...
- We heard it three times.

57:34.286 --> 57:36.830
This Guthred is now a king.

57:36.955 --> 57:39.541
- What of the dead horseman?
- FISKE: Lord...

57:39.666 --> 57:43.295
King Guthred is building up an army

57:44.588 --> 57:48.050
made up of both Danes and Saxons.

57:48.175 --> 57:51.928
And the commander of this army
is just that.

57:52.054 --> 57:54.222
Both Dane and Saxon.

57:55.098 --> 57:57.434
SVEN: His name is Uhtred.

58:03.607 --> 58:05.692
- Are you certain of this?
- Yes.

58:08.612 --> 58:09.863
Tekil.

58:11.156 --> 58:12.866
Lord?

58:12.991 --> 58:15.786
KJARTAN: If the king of Cumbraland
is building an anny,

58:15.911 --> 58:17.913
you will join him.

58:19.915 --> 58:22.542
If you get the chance,
you can kill the king.

58:23.752 --> 58:27.464
But you will bring his commander
back here, to me.

58:27.589 --> 58:29.424
- Take his eye.
- KJARTAN: Yes.

58:30.759 --> 58:36.306
You can take his eye, but I want him
here and I want him alive.

58:37.307 --> 58:39.685
I will take him piece by piece.

58:40.477 --> 58:42.270
I will make him suffer.

58:43.897 --> 58:47.025
Uhtred Ragnarson

58:47.901 --> 58:49.611
is mine.
