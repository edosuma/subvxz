WEBVTT

00:09.466 --> 00:11.518
So, I need you to try
and remember everything

00:11.534 --> 00:13.652
Todd was doing and saying last week.

00:13.677 --> 00:16.486
It doesn't matter
how small or useless it seems.

00:16.506 --> 00:21.470
Ferrari 458 Speciale.
Personalised number plate, P-B?

00:21.490 --> 00:23.510
So, Todd Wilson was a hero
in his wife's eyes,

00:23.530 --> 00:26.295
but he did do a spot of auto theft,
Your Honour.

00:26.454 --> 00:28.522
There's one embryo left
and it's just sitting there.

00:28.538 --> 00:30.470
Your Honour, if it is property,

00:30.490 --> 00:33.255
it's part of Ash's estate,
which she left to me.

00:33.466 --> 00:36.458
Alright, I'm referring this matter
to mediation.

00:36.478 --> 00:40.067
This is Jane Carter. She was driving
the car you crashed into.

00:40.092 --> 00:42.478
She has burns to 50% of her body.

00:42.498 --> 00:44.546
Major Hamilton, I put it to you
that you did nothing

00:45.466 --> 00:46.502
because his weakness
made you feel stronger.

00:46.522 --> 00:48.514
You've got a damn hide.
And you, Major Hamilton,

00:48.530 --> 00:50.482
had a soldier who killed himself

00:50.502 --> 00:52.486
because you preferred
to see him suffer.

00:52.506 --> 00:56.565
You want to get these guns off the
street, you need what's in my head,

00:56.590 --> 01:00.296
and you'd better be ready for
the shit storm it's gonna unleash.

01:01.458 --> 01:03.514
By the way, did we ever get that
ballistics report on the bullets

01:03.534 --> 01:06.299
from the drive-by?
It shouldn't be too far away.

01:06.324 --> 01:07.736
Mm, neither's Christmas.

01:08.482 --> 01:10.454
I'm dead if I talk to you.

01:10.474 --> 01:13.454
That gun was used
in two other crimes -

01:13.474 --> 01:17.466
the kneecapping of Felix Murphy
and the murder of Ashleigh Larsson.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

01:43.530 --> 01:45.478
I got out of the car.

01:47.526 --> 01:49.494
I thought that Ash had tripped.

01:51.466 --> 01:52.506
Ash! Ash!

01:52.522 --> 01:55.454
I knelt by her side, turned her over.

01:56.494 --> 01:58.458
Her eyes were open but empty.

02:00.482 --> 02:02.424
There have been
18 other shootings

02:02.454 --> 02:04.522
in the larger south-west area.
What if he was still here?

02:04.542 --> 02:07.478
Range of powers that the police
can only dream of.

02:07.494 --> 02:08.612
A Royal Commission.

02:08.637 --> 02:12.167
What could the twins see?
I'm expecting them home any second.

02:12.450 --> 02:14.458
That gun was used
in two other crimes...

02:14.478 --> 02:16.502
The weapon used...
..the murder of Ashleigh Larsson.

02:16.522 --> 02:19.458
I wasn't going to just
stand there and get shot too.

02:19.478 --> 02:21.302
What'll you do with the embryo?

02:21.327 --> 02:23.916
It's part of Ash's estate,
which she left me.

02:54.494 --> 02:57.482
â™ª Theme music

03:23.462 --> 03:25.514
So, George was murdered moments
before he was going to tell us

03:25.534 --> 03:29.490
who gave him his gun, a fact
that was supposed to be a secret.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.216
So, the obvious question is,
do we have a leak?

03:32.458 --> 03:34.462
From inside the commission?
Unlikely. But possible.

03:34.478 --> 03:35.518
Intentionally, I doubt it.

03:35.538 --> 03:38.424
Maybe there's an outside chance
there was loose talk somewhere.

03:38.450 --> 03:40.490
He also lost half a kilo of coke
in that car crash, though,

03:40.510 --> 03:42.478
which is a pretty expensive
stuff-up.

03:42.498 --> 03:45.424
Didn't necessarily need a leak
for someone to wanna kill him.

03:45.450 --> 03:46.979
OK, so what do we do?

03:47.005 --> 03:49.985
Put our heads in the sand, say, 'It
couldn't have been us' and carry on?

03:50.005 --> 03:52.945
Janet, Terry's all over this,
so why don't we just wait and see

03:52.965 --> 03:54.013
what they find out before
starting witch-hunts?

03:54.039 --> 03:57.945
OK. But until we know for sure,
let's at least keep all operations

03:57.961 --> 03:59.961
on a strictly needs-to-know basis.

04:00.981 --> 04:02.334
Morning.
Morning, Janet.

04:02.808 --> 04:04.985
Do we know if forensics
found any DNA?

04:05.005 --> 04:07.300
They swabbed the rope
on George's hands,

04:07.325 --> 04:09.333
around the facial bruising
and under the fingernails.

04:09.933 --> 04:11.017
No result yet.
He must have been a terrible sight.

04:11.937 --> 04:14.029
Well, this commission will not
be intimidated. We'll just carry on.

04:14.949 --> 04:16.969
We may have lost George,
but we still have Felix Murphy, yes?

04:16.985 --> 04:17.969
Correct.

04:17.988 --> 04:21.577
He was kneecapped by the same
gun used in the Nobakht drive-by

04:21.603 --> 04:22.961
and Ash's murder.

04:22.981 --> 04:26.957
Significantly, unlike all
these others, he's still alive.

04:26.977 --> 04:29.029
He was shot in broad daylight,
at point blank range? Yes.

04:29.945 --> 04:30.965
So, he saw who shot him?

04:30.985 --> 04:33.945
Well, he claims he never saw
anything but yes, he must have.

04:33.961 --> 04:34.985
He knows exactly who shot him.

04:35.001 --> 04:36.957
What was he - drug courier?

04:36.973 --> 04:37.985
Gambler.

04:38.005 --> 04:39.989
Borrowed lots, lost everything,
owed everybody.

04:40.009 --> 04:42.933
His phone records linked him
to several short-term money-lenders,

04:42.953 --> 04:44.973
but we never got enough evidence
to make anyone a real suspect.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.346
We need to get a summons.
I'll get on it.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.371
He won't talk.
We can at least try.

04:50.997 --> 04:53.005
And let's not forget about
Todd Wilson, yeah?

04:53.025 --> 04:54.997
His murder and the drive-by
have to be connected.

04:55.017 --> 04:57.965
It's another way in for us.
What about those missing three hours?

04:57.985 --> 05:00.338
Still missing, sorry.
They're just blank.

05:00.985 --> 05:03.945
We thought if Elaheh did an appeal
to the public,

05:03.965 --> 05:05.957
ask if anyone might have seen Todd
that day.

05:05.977 --> 05:07.997
Do those things even work?
Some of the time, yeah.

05:08.017 --> 05:11.194
But for every real sighting,
you'll get 100 false ones.

05:11.214 --> 05:13.744
Alright.
Anyone afraid of a little overtime?

05:13.769 --> 05:15.492
Let's do it.

05:15.985 --> 05:17.029
Can I have a sec?

05:20.957 --> 05:22.840
Keep your legs crossed, darling.

05:37.981 --> 05:39.981
You've known for months
that the gun that killed Ash

05:39.997 --> 05:41.993
was used again on Felix Murphy?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.029
Yes.

05:45.977 --> 05:47.001
Alright.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.969
OK, leaving aside
your decision not to tell me,

05:54.989 --> 05:57.813
because I know you'll say
it's standard procedure

05:57.949 --> 05:58.997
to protect the integrity
of the investigation...

05:59.017 --> 06:01.025
Absolutely correct and proper
conduct, considering...

06:01.941 --> 06:03.177
It has driven me mad.

06:04.029 --> 06:07.441
I've spent the last two years
thinking it was all dead-ends

06:07.466 --> 06:10.009
and now I find this, and...

06:10.029 --> 06:13.001
...and all morning it's been like
this one question pounding into me -

06:13.021 --> 06:16.937
'What else? What else does he know?
What else hasn't he told me?'

06:16.957 --> 06:18.969
Nothing. And can I believe that?
There is nothing else...

06:18.989 --> 06:21.009
How do I know that you wouldn't
keep it all to yourself,

06:21.029 --> 06:24.088
and why would you,
when you know what it means to me?

06:25.957 --> 06:27.993
We have worked together for years.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.308
You know
I wouldn't jeopardise anything.

06:30.333 --> 06:33.341
I can hear news about Ash
and remain perfectly calm.

06:35.009 --> 06:38.985
There's nothing tying the Murphy
kneecapping to Ash's murder.

06:39.001 --> 06:41.933
Yeah, right. Apart from the weapon.

06:41.953 --> 06:43.001
And you don't think
that was investigated thoroughly?

06:43.021 --> 06:45.198
I don't know.
How was it investigated?

06:45.223 --> 06:48.981
I put one of my best
undercover officers straight on it.

06:49.001 --> 06:52.017
He worked for six months on Felix.
He got nowhere.

06:52.937 --> 06:55.055
I understand the significance,
Janet.

06:55.080 --> 06:58.132
Whoever kneecapped Felix
knows Ash's killer.

06:58.945 --> 07:02.949
We haven't gone easy on this.
We have just come up against a wall.

07:03.981 --> 07:07.977
Can we talk to this
undercover officer? Please?

07:07.993 --> 07:09.969
I don't know if that's possible.

07:09.989 --> 07:14.021
Well... whatever he can give us
on Felix Murphy would help.

07:16.993 --> 07:19.052
OK, fair enough. I'll look into it.

07:19.077 --> 07:21.372
Now's a good time.
When I can get to it.

07:30.981 --> 07:32.570
It won't take long, Elaheh.

07:32.945 --> 07:35.534
We just want to pop in
and have a quick chat.

07:35.945 --> 07:38.004
It will just be Heather and myself.

07:38.029 --> 07:40.265
It's OK.
Amin doesn't need to be there.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.025
Are you OK?

07:46.941 --> 07:48.021
What about you?

07:49.941 --> 07:52.985
Did I catch a look earlier, when I
said we should bring in Felix Murphy?

07:53.005 --> 07:55.029
Yeah.
I thought so.

07:55.949 --> 07:57.969
I understand why...
My opinion?

07:57.989 --> 07:59.949
It should have been left open
for discussion,

07:59.969 --> 08:01.937
considering it could be
a death warrant.

08:01.953 --> 08:03.949
That said, I think you're right.

08:03.969 --> 08:06.025
If we talk to lots of others
and don't summon Felix,

08:06.945 --> 08:08.933
he's gonna start to look like
the odd one out.

08:08.953 --> 08:10.933
And you know what that'll have
those other people thinking.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.949
That he's already working with us.

08:12.974 --> 08:15.977
So, he's safer going your way.

08:15.997 --> 08:17.969
But you've got to make it
an open hearing.

08:17.985 --> 08:19.937
None of this closed-door stuff.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.899
Everyone's got to know
that he kept his mouth shut.

08:22.924 --> 08:23.924
Point taken.

08:24.957 --> 08:27.953
How do you think they knew George
was going to talk to us?

08:27.973 --> 08:29.937
They would've known
I got him arrested,

08:29.957 --> 08:31.977
and everyone knows he generally did
what I told him to do.

08:31.997 --> 08:34.961
That's what kept him out of jail
all these years.

08:34.981 --> 08:38.933
Wouldn't have taken much
to put two and two together.

08:38.953 --> 08:43.011
He was a friend of yours, wasn't he?
I know how it is. The lines blur.

08:43.032 --> 08:45.032
He mucked up a lot,
but he wasn't a bad bloke.

08:45.052 --> 08:47.961
There's a few you'd rather
never been born,

08:47.981 --> 08:50.005
but most of the guys I represent
treat me well.

08:50.021 --> 08:51.981
They listen, watch their language.

08:52.001 --> 08:54.001
Better behaved than a lot of
potato heads, that's for sure.

08:54.021 --> 08:56.374
And us prosecutors.
Your words, not mine.

08:57.933 --> 09:00.953
Except we do see the pain
and the damage, of course.

09:00.973 --> 09:02.945
If only you could spend more time
with victims

09:02.965 --> 09:04.937
and we understood the defendants
better.

09:04.957 --> 09:06.933
Then we'd have justice
instead of a legal system.

09:06.953 --> 09:09.365
Mm, pot of gold at the end
of the rainbow.

09:09.390 --> 09:12.920
Neither of us can say we never
made a mistake though, can we?

09:12.997 --> 09:15.933
I've had my fair share
of aborted trials.

09:15.949 --> 09:17.361
Lots of convictions too.

09:17.386 --> 09:20.965
Heather?
Elaheh's right to speak to us.

09:20.985 --> 09:22.945
You've got your wish.
What's that?

09:22.965 --> 09:24.021
Me spending more time
with the victims.

09:24.937 --> 09:26.290
Is that a priority?

09:26.949 --> 09:28.029
I'm just looking at the prosecution
of prestige car theft...

09:28.949 --> 09:32.008
Can you drop that?
Um, I need to talk to you outside.

09:43.021 --> 09:44.937
Flat white?

09:44.953 --> 09:46.659
I don't have any money, so...

09:46.684 --> 09:49.953
No, we can start an account
if you like.

09:49.969 --> 09:51.949
Thank you, I would love one.

09:54.029 --> 09:56.969
How much do one of these cost
to set up anyway?

09:57.993 --> 09:59.937
Career change on the cards?

09:59.953 --> 10:01.601
It's tempting some days.

10:01.937 --> 10:04.977
Not that much cheaper
than a cafe.

10:04.997 --> 10:07.957
You save on bricks and mortar but
then you have to pay council fees

10:07.977 --> 10:10.009
every time you make a stop,
and you have public liability and...

10:10.029 --> 10:12.937
The bureaucracy's expanding
to meet the needs

10:12.953 --> 10:14.659
of the expanding bureaucracy.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.969
That's not me, that's Oscar Wilde.

10:17.989 --> 10:21.973
'To lose one parent may be
regarded as a misfortune,

10:21.993 --> 10:24.170
to lose both looks like
carelessness.'

10:24.961 --> 10:26.491
Studied him at school too.

10:28.997 --> 10:31.985
Thank you.
No worries.

10:32.001 --> 10:33.013
Great.

10:35.933 --> 10:39.957
You know that Ash and I
conceived through IVF?

10:39.973 --> 10:40.969
Yeah.

10:41.981 --> 10:45.973
Ash's sister is taking me to court
over the last frozen embryo.

10:45.989 --> 10:47.013
Awkward.

10:47.933 --> 10:50.953
I have to file an affidavit
before the mediation,

10:50.973 --> 10:52.977
and I've just found out
it's the day after tomorrow.

10:52.997 --> 10:56.009
Deb wants a court order
giving it to her and I...

10:56.029 --> 10:58.945
...I don't want that.
Well, at least not at the moment.

10:58.965 --> 11:00.997
As Ash's partner,
shouldn't it belong to you?

11:01.017 --> 11:05.076
Well, it does, if it's property.
If it's life, things aren't so clear.

11:05.101 --> 11:08.157
The agreement that Ash and I signed
was that in the event of separation,

11:08.874 --> 11:10.933
we would share the embryos equally.

11:10.953 --> 11:12.941
And you only specified
separation...

11:12.961 --> 11:14.981
Look, I'd really appreciate
if you could find me some law.

11:15.001 --> 11:17.941
I've got to convince Deb that
if she goes to court she'll lose,

11:17.957 --> 11:18.965
and then...

11:18.985 --> 11:21.750
...and then maybe we can talk about it
properly.

11:21.775 --> 11:23.763
Yes, of course.

11:23.989 --> 11:26.695
Do you want to use it
to try for another child?

11:29.013 --> 11:33.308
Well, I just want the right to decide
that in my own time, when I'm ready.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.569
I don't want that decision
made for me.

11:36.981 --> 11:40.687
I know from the outside it probably
seems quite straightforward,

11:40.712 --> 11:44.768
but just I have this, um...
it's like an emotional attachment.

11:44.933 --> 11:46.953
It's...
Anyway, I know it's not rational.

11:46.969 --> 11:47.993
I'll get to it.

11:48.009 --> 11:48.993
Thanks.

12:12.005 --> 12:15.977
Robbie Carter?
Detective Inspector Andy Campbell.

12:18.949 --> 12:21.538
I thought you should hear this
from us first.

12:22.937 --> 12:26.937
Last night, the man who crashed
into your wife was killed.

12:33.957 --> 12:36.781
She was semi-conscious for hours
after the crash.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.937
And her burns were terrible.

12:39.957 --> 12:43.663
She'd smashed her head on the
steering wheel and the pain was...

12:44.945 --> 12:45.977
I can't imagine.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.059
Since then it's been one long fight.

12:52.029 --> 12:56.997
So frankly, whatever George Healy
went through... he got off light.

13:00.009 --> 13:04.068
You've either got to believe there's
some sort of karma to everything,

13:04.093 --> 13:09.021
some ledger somewhere that's
keeping track of our moral debt...

13:10.013 --> 13:13.937
...or it's just all
a mindless bloody lottery.

13:19.981 --> 13:22.040
She was just going into the office.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.941
She said it'd be quieter
on a public holiday.

13:26.957 --> 13:29.977
There's no phone calls, you know?

13:33.933 --> 13:36.051
It's just a mindless bloody lottery.

13:44.021 --> 13:47.669
This could speed up the investigation
and help get you answers.

13:47.694 --> 13:48.965
No. I can't.

13:48.985 --> 13:51.456
Won't take long.
Just a short piece for TV.

13:51.481 --> 13:53.993
Please,
we don't want any more attention.

13:54.013 --> 13:56.957
Susie, we really think
this will help.

13:56.973 --> 13:58.937
Don't you want this to be over?

13:58.953 --> 13:59.973
We've been through enough.

13:59.993 --> 14:03.969
You know, people think that we're
in a gang or that we're terrorists.

14:03.989 --> 14:05.933
Elaheh is getting abused
on the street...

14:05.953 --> 14:08.965
This is a chance to change people's
minds - about you, about Todd.

14:08.985 --> 14:11.868
Look, we appreciate
what you're trying to do here,

14:11.937 --> 14:13.937
but please, just leave us alone.

14:14.985 --> 14:17.945
Elaheh, this is your decision.

14:18.977 --> 14:21.009
Our house has been shot at.

14:21.029 --> 14:23.973
One of your witnesses
has been murdered.

14:25.009 --> 14:26.945
Whoever is doing this,

14:26.965 --> 14:29.848
this is how they deal
with people who talk to you.

14:30.981 --> 14:34.985
So, why would I go public,
ask people to dob this person in?

14:36.029 --> 14:39.965
If you were in my position,
would you go through with it,

14:39.985 --> 14:43.162
knowing you were putting
your family's lives in danger?

14:46.946 --> 14:50.005
Elaheh, this person
has already targeted your family.

14:50.025 --> 14:52.937
You need to help us.
Why can't the police do it?

14:52.957 --> 14:56.193
It will mean more coming from
a member of the community.

14:56.981 --> 14:59.989
Once they hear you speak, they won't
think gang member or terrorist,

15:00.005 --> 15:02.064
they'll see someone just like them.

15:02.949 --> 15:05.185
Silence only normalises
this behaviour.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.236
This community needs someone
to stand up

15:10.261 --> 15:12.289
and say, 'Enough is enough.'

15:12.981 --> 15:15.276
You are in the best position
to do that.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.989
It took a little convincing.
Well done.

15:21.009 --> 15:24.774
Heather's liaising with the police
to take calls from the public.

15:24.875 --> 15:25.993
Can't we handle it?

15:26.013 --> 15:28.953
Well, it is our operation.
We've got the 1800 number.

15:28.973 --> 15:31.005
We can second staff
as needed to man the phones.

15:31.021 --> 15:32.374
Sure. I'll get onto it.

15:32.933 --> 15:33.433
Thanks.

15:35.981 --> 15:36.977
Um...

15:36.993 --> 15:39.009
Upgrading the server. It's OK.

15:39.029 --> 15:43.949
Your VPN's trying to authenticate
with the old one.

15:43.969 --> 15:46.993
I'll just force a manual
group policy update.

15:49.005 --> 15:51.949
I got onto that guy
we put on Felix.

15:51.969 --> 15:54.993
Yeah, when's he coming in?

15:56.985 --> 15:58.969
Senior Constable Calder.

15:58.989 --> 16:02.048
He's my undercover guy,
except he's undercover again.

16:02.941 --> 16:04.001
I assured his boss
we wouldn't blow his cover.

16:04.021 --> 16:06.374
I appreciate you agreeing
to speak to me.

16:08.961 --> 16:11.973
Um, right. So...

16:15.965 --> 16:19.013
So, how close did you get to Felix?

16:19.029 --> 16:21.147
Pretty close. He had no other mates.

16:21.163 --> 16:23.123
Right, so he's a bit of a loner?

16:23.139 --> 16:24.941
He was back then.

16:24.961 --> 16:27.025
He actually started gambling
to help his fiancee's sister.

16:27.941 --> 16:29.933
He wanted to bail her out.

16:29.953 --> 16:32.961
Instead, he gambled
his ex's $50,000 house deposit,

16:32.981 --> 16:34.005
and then he pawned
her engagement ring,

16:34.021 --> 16:35.965
which is why he had no friends.

16:35.985 --> 16:38.103
But you gained his trust?
Absolutely.

16:38.128 --> 16:41.132
But he was terrified of the guy
who shot him,

16:41.933 --> 16:42.977
and he would never say who that was.

16:42.997 --> 16:45.174
So, threats of jail wouldn't work?
No.

16:45.199 --> 16:46.435
Financial rewards?
No.

16:46.945 --> 16:49.025
There's really nothing we can do
to get that name out of him?

16:49.945 --> 16:51.977
He genuinely believes
if he told anyone who shot him,

16:51.993 --> 16:53.941
he'll be dead the next day.

16:56.017 --> 16:58.941
I wish I could be more help.

16:58.957 --> 16:59.981
Thank you.

17:01.933 --> 17:02.698
Thanks, Neil.

17:21.025 --> 17:23.949
Now this is what I call
an open-plan office.

17:23.969 --> 17:26.017
Hey.
What are you doing here?

17:26.933 --> 17:28.969
Just... doing some work.

17:28.985 --> 17:31.941
I've been stuck inside all day.

17:31.957 --> 17:32.997
Mm.

17:33.017 --> 17:37.017
Actually, it's not really work-work,
it's more a favour for a friend.

17:37.033 --> 17:38.092
Looks legal to me.

17:38.117 --> 17:39.997
Good guess.
What's the case?

17:40.017 --> 17:45.981
Is an embryo, only eight cells big,
life or not life?

17:46.001 --> 17:49.949
Well, whatever your answer is,
you'll be right.

17:49.965 --> 17:50.965
What do you mean?

17:50.990 --> 17:54.005
Well,
how many whiskers make a beard?

17:54.025 --> 17:57.005
Everyone agrees that one isn't,
but a thousand is.

17:57.025 --> 17:59.961
So, it becomes a beard
without any of us

17:59.981 --> 18:02.158
being able
to clearly pick the moment.

18:02.183 --> 18:06.125
So, everyone will pick a different
moment, and they'll all be right.

18:06.150 --> 18:07.327
There's your answer.

18:08.997 --> 18:11.013
Um, are you done for the day?

18:11.029 --> 18:13.017
As a matter of fact, I am.

18:13.937 --> 18:15.009
What, you weren't waiting for me,
were you?

18:15.025 --> 18:16.965
What? No!

18:16.985 --> 18:20.750
Well, seeing as we're both not
working, why don't we get a drink?

18:20.775 --> 18:21.965
Really?

18:21.981 --> 18:22.985
Why not?

18:23.005 --> 18:26.009
I thought you might be dirty on us
for putting you under surveillance.

18:26.029 --> 18:27.977
I never said I was buying.

18:33.961 --> 18:36.933
So, what can I get you?
Whatever pale ale's on tap.

18:36.953 --> 18:39.365
I've just got to zip to the loo.
Schooner?

18:39.390 --> 18:43.354
Come on, Richard, you going to get me
a straw as well? A pint.

18:56.945 --> 18:59.005
No toilet paper.

19:58.021 --> 19:59.981
Hey, is this seat taken?

19:59.997 --> 20:01.945
Yeah, she's in the bathroom.

20:18.941 --> 20:21.353
Um, sorry, I'm just looking
for my friend.

20:21.378 --> 20:24.418
Is she still in there?
Tall, attractive, pretty.

20:24.933 --> 20:28.345
I don't know, go and look
for yourself. She's not in there.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.969
Hey, it's Keisha,
leave a message.

20:41.989 --> 20:44.989
Um... Hey, Keisha, it's...
it's Richard.

20:45.005 --> 20:47.957
Is everything alright?

20:47.977 --> 20:52.001
Can you give me a call
when you get this? OK, bye.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.005
You don't need to do this.

21:00.025 --> 21:02.933
It's not what's best for our family
right now.

21:02.949 --> 21:04.025
Everything OK?

21:04.941 --> 21:06.009
Just nervous.

21:06.029 --> 21:09.949
Well, that's natural.
Just take a few deep breaths.

21:09.965 --> 21:12.025
Remember why you're doing this.

21:16.989 --> 21:20.961
I'm sorry.
I can't lose the people I have left.

21:20.981 --> 21:25.933
El, Karen and I will be by your side
the whole time.

21:25.953 --> 21:30.025
I'll start talking and you just come
in when you're comfortable, OK?

21:32.021 --> 21:33.965
Just speak from the heart.

21:42.993 --> 21:44.052
When you're ready.

22:13.029 --> 22:15.025
Lina left her fitness thing.

22:18.997 --> 22:22.937
I've decided to hold off
on Felix for now.

22:22.957 --> 22:25.965
Second thoughts?
No, just need time.

22:26.989 --> 22:29.985
I want to organise
another undercover operation.

22:30.005 --> 22:32.957
On Felix?
But this time, we'll use a woman.

22:32.973 --> 22:34.945
Why makes you think a woman

22:34.965 --> 22:36.965
is more likely
to get him to do what you want?

22:36.985 --> 22:39.945
Says the man who drove back to work
to pick up his wife's pedometer.

22:39.965 --> 22:42.083
She's got you there, mate.

22:42.941 --> 22:45.933
Right, I mean, think about it.
No, no, I am, I am.

22:45.953 --> 22:47.981
He does like to help girls
in trouble, Neil said that.

22:48.001 --> 22:52.296
And you have experience running this
sort of operation, so I was hoping...

22:52.321 --> 22:54.305
Sure, happy to.

22:55.953 --> 22:58.130
And it stays between the three of us.

23:00.941 --> 23:02.957
OK, I got it.

23:02.973 --> 23:04.029
Yeah.

23:05.977 --> 23:06.977
OK.

23:10.965 --> 23:13.001
Hey! Hey!
I got your fit thing.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.961
Aww, I just went for a run.

23:14.981 --> 23:17.511
- Well, you have to do it again, then.
- No.

23:17.536 --> 23:18.969
How'd it go last night?

23:18.985 --> 23:20.997
Alright, I think.

23:21.017 --> 23:23.953
If Elaheh's appeal doesn't work,
I don't know what we'll do.

23:23.973 --> 23:25.997
Well, I think the skill's
in sorting through the nonsense,

23:26.013 --> 23:27.719
otherwise you'll drown in it.

23:27.937 --> 23:29.933
Just think laterally
and, um, you'll be fine.

23:29.953 --> 23:32.009
Should we be worried
about the Nobakhts?

23:32.025 --> 23:33.989
What if they're targeted again?

23:34.005 --> 23:35.957
No, if anyone's gonna be targeted,

23:35.977 --> 23:37.005
it'll be those who know
what happened,

23:37.021 --> 23:38.993
not those asking for information.

23:39.009 --> 23:40.997
I guess.

23:41.017 --> 23:43.025
It just suddenly feels
as if everything's on my shoulders.

23:43.941 --> 23:46.005
I mean, Felix won't talk.

23:46.025 --> 23:48.908
We're struggling to find
any other viable options.

23:48.933 --> 23:51.845
If this doesn't work, it's on me.

23:51.945 --> 23:54.017
Be careful what you wish for, hey?

23:54.937 --> 23:56.981
If there's useful information,
you are gonna find it.

23:56.997 --> 23:58.965
I know you will.

23:59.993 --> 24:02.758
But if no-one saw Todd
and no-one comes forward,

24:02.783 --> 24:05.783
then that is not on you,
and we'll find another way.

24:06.961 --> 24:09.491
Well, I hope you have some ideas,
Detective.

24:15.001 --> 24:17.649
Now, finish your breakfast, please.

24:24.005 --> 24:26.977
What's this?
Your undercover operation.

24:26.997 --> 24:30.941
That's how we arrange the intro
and character background.

24:32.021 --> 24:33.981
Are you sure pursuing Felix

24:34.001 --> 24:36.961
won't look like you're
actually chasing Ash's killer?

24:36.981 --> 24:41.005
We're chasing whoever shot up the
Nobakht house. I'd be remiss not to.

24:41.025 --> 24:43.378
And you think that's all
the AG will see?

24:43.403 --> 24:45.415
It's all he'll read in his
final report, unless you think

24:45.941 --> 24:47.013
one of his golf buddies
might tell him otherwise.

24:47.029 --> 24:48.961
If he sees a personal vendetta,

24:48.981 --> 24:50.961
it's not gonna be because somebody
gave him the heads-up.

24:50.981 --> 24:54.864
Circulation of illegal guns cannot
be understood, let alone fought,

24:54.937 --> 24:56.941
without operations such as this.

24:56.961 --> 24:58.997
OK, well, we need to find
a female cop,

24:59.017 --> 25:01.973
and the State police can't help us
for all the usual reasons -

25:01.989 --> 25:03.166
time, money, people.

25:03.191 --> 25:05.368
So, we're back to the Federal Police?

25:07.961 --> 25:09.941
Do you think this will work?

25:09.957 --> 25:11.965
If we find the right person.

25:11.981 --> 25:13.021
I could do it.

25:13.941 --> 25:16.941
I have the experience
and I'm across our objectives.

25:16.966 --> 25:18.973
How do you see it playing out?

25:18.993 --> 25:20.973
Gradually gain his trust
to the point where you ask

25:20.989 --> 25:22.977
if he could get you a weapon.

25:22.997 --> 25:25.941
Am I a criminal
or do I need it for protection?

25:25.961 --> 25:27.993
You're a cleanskin
with an abusive partner.

25:28.013 --> 25:30.965
Basically, you're in fear for your
life when you ask for that gun,

25:30.985 --> 25:33.985
and he'll be a hero
protecting a damsel in distress.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.009
That's doable.

25:35.029 --> 25:38.941
This isn't a decision
you should make lightly.

25:38.957 --> 25:39.989
Felix isn't a hardened crim.

25:40.009 --> 25:41.981
He's caught up with
a pretty heavy crowd.

25:42.001 --> 25:44.766
I mean, the majority
of the kneecapping suspects

25:44.945 --> 25:48.416
have multiple convictions
for assault, firearms, kidnapping.

25:48.441 --> 25:49.425
Terry.

25:50.997 --> 25:55.933
Can it wait, or...?
Alright, on my way.

25:56.981 --> 25:59.217
Is that information
about George Healy?

25:59.242 --> 26:01.772
Could be.
I'll call you when I know. OK.

26:02.005 --> 26:03.933
Just think about it.

26:05.945 --> 26:07.298
We'll talk again later.

26:19.933 --> 26:21.021
Thanks for this.
I know it's above and beyond.

26:21.937 --> 26:23.702
Hey, I'm always happy to help.

26:24.945 --> 26:28.534
So, unfortunately the courts
are way behind on the technology.

26:28.937 --> 26:30.953
There's not one single judge
that's ordered that a frozen embryo

26:30.973 --> 26:33.385
is definitely property
or definitely life.

26:33.937 --> 26:35.961
From what I've gleaned so far,

26:35.981 --> 26:37.961
the embryo disputes
that have made it court

26:37.981 --> 26:39.973
are almost exclusively between
heterosexual couples.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.637
You could be making history.

26:41.941 --> 26:43.989
Well, hang on, your instructions
were to keep me out of court.

26:44.009 --> 26:47.715
So, what have you found that says,
'Deb, you will not win this?'

26:47.937 --> 26:51.977
Family Court, Queensland, 2009.

26:51.997 --> 26:54.174
Divorced couple,
ten leftover embryos.

26:54.945 --> 26:56.953
Husband wants to donate them,
wife wants them to succumb

26:56.973 --> 26:58.985
as per their written agreement,
arguing that she and her ex

26:59.005 --> 27:01.941
can't have separate lives
if a baby is born.

27:01.961 --> 27:04.726
Court agrees, embryos destroyed.
Can I use this?

27:04.945 --> 27:07.181
Well, your agreement
is more ambiguous.

27:07.206 --> 27:10.383
But in that case, the court
refused to compel one donor

27:10.941 --> 27:11.977
to become a parent
against their will.

27:13.029 --> 27:15.001
Yeah, but technically,
I wouldn't be forced

27:15.021 --> 27:17.949
into becoming a parent
if Deborah had a baby -

27:17.965 --> 27:19.318
I'd be an aunty-in-law.

27:19.949 --> 27:23.361
Emotionally, you'd have to feel
connected, you could argue.

27:23.386 --> 27:27.151
But it would still largely come down
to the judge's discretion...

27:27.989 --> 27:30.048
...since it's Ash's egg, not yours.

27:30.073 --> 27:31.937
Well, that doesn't matter.

27:31.957 --> 27:35.722
Deborah may share blood with Ash,
but we decided to share a life.

27:35.933 --> 27:38.228
We chose each other,
we went through IVF

27:38.253 --> 27:40.273
and... and that was our future.

27:42.851 --> 27:44.969
You know,
I would feel like a parent,

27:44.989 --> 27:47.284
and therefore this decision
is relevant.

27:47.309 --> 27:50.313
Maybe we should argue
that the embryo is a person.

27:50.941 --> 27:52.949
You're talking about collective
intentions when you make plans...

27:52.969 --> 27:55.499
No, if it's a person,
it isn't bequeathable.

27:55.524 --> 27:59.500
I can't say it's part of Ash's
estate. I can't own a life.

27:59.957 --> 28:03.016
And then it comes down
to a debate over Ash's wishes,

28:03.041 --> 28:05.025
which is exactly what Deb wants.

28:05.945 --> 28:07.961
Yes, apologies. I haven't had time
to think that through.

28:07.977 --> 28:08.989
It's OK.

28:16.009 --> 28:19.127
Todd wanted to know
if we were having a boy or a girl.

28:19.152 --> 28:22.152
I wanted a surprise,
and he agreed to wait and see.

28:24.953 --> 28:28.248
When he died, I decided to find out,
like he'd wanted to.

28:29.933 --> 28:33.981
Our son,
he'll never know his father's love.

28:35.021 --> 28:38.993
Someone saw Todd before he died.
Someone knows something.

28:39.009 --> 28:41.973
It doesn't matter how small.

28:41.989 --> 28:45.021
If you saw Todd on Australia Day...

28:45.941 --> 28:48.021
Andy was right when he said
it would stir up the crazies.

28:48.941 --> 28:50.993
'Sighted Todd walking a pig
in Redfern on Australia Day.'

28:51.013 --> 28:52.981
As you do.
Mm.

28:53.001 --> 28:55.933
I reckon a third of these
we could ditch immediately.

28:55.953 --> 28:59.012
Are you sure you want to risk
missing something real?

28:59.037 --> 29:00.945
Hey, you want to help us out?

29:00.965 --> 29:03.005
I can soon, I'm just doing
some research on car-stealing.

29:03.025 --> 29:04.981
Ferrari-stealing?
Yeah.

29:05.001 --> 29:07.013
It turns out high-performance
vehicles like that

29:07.029 --> 29:08.997
only really get stolen on order,

29:09.017 --> 29:11.194
when the stealer knows
he has a buyer.

29:11.214 --> 29:14.166
There's no point otherwise.
They attract far too much attention.

29:14.182 --> 29:15.981
Where does that get you?

29:15.997 --> 29:17.025
I don't know yet.

29:19.949 --> 29:21.953
You go, I'll be right.
Thanks.

29:23.937 --> 29:24.933
You alright?

29:32.021 --> 29:33.965
So, what do I do?

29:33.985 --> 29:35.985
Someone has to tell her.
We can't sit on this.

29:36.005 --> 29:37.993
Did you get the email?
Nearly gave me a stroke.

29:38.013 --> 29:40.543
Does it mean she's gonna
have to stand down?

29:40.568 --> 29:42.588
Well, shouldn't that be her decision?
It has to be her decision,

29:42.933 --> 29:45.051
which hopefully
I can help her reach.

29:45.076 --> 29:47.841
How are the phones tracking?
We've had 68 calls.

29:47.937 --> 29:49.957
Most are your lonely types,
attention-seekers.

29:49.977 --> 29:51.969
Any confirmed sightings?
Not yet.

29:51.985 --> 29:54.029
Tony, this is a surprise.

29:54.945 --> 29:56.985
A word, in private, excuse me.

30:08.009 --> 30:12.013
The DNA tests came back from
the rope around George's wrists.

30:13.021 --> 30:15.017
One is a cold hit.

30:15.937 --> 30:18.945
The other matches the DNA
on the balaclava

30:18.961 --> 30:20.993
that was found near Ash's murder.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.029
You must be joking.

30:38.933 --> 30:39.949
Why would...

30:41.937 --> 30:45.702
One possibility is that whoever
killed Ash was a contract killer.

30:47.961 --> 30:48.993
Say that again?

30:49.013 --> 30:51.131
It could have been
a contract killer.

30:51.156 --> 30:53.176
They killed Ash and then they
were hired again to kill George.

30:53.949 --> 30:57.985
Or it's secondary transfer.
Someone else touched the rope.

31:09.965 --> 31:13.973
So, the person that murdered Ash
may have killed George Healy.

31:13.993 --> 31:17.111
He's handled the rope used
to tie George's hands, yes.

31:17.941 --> 31:19.997
And the Nobakht house was shot up

31:20.017 --> 31:22.194
using the same weapon
that killed Ash.

31:22.219 --> 31:23.239
Correct.

31:28.977 --> 31:31.977
We've assumed that
whoever shot up the Nobakht house

31:31.997 --> 31:34.009
did it to get the money
that Todd had ripped off.

31:34.029 --> 31:37.985
Well, the problem is, we don't know
and he could still be after you.

31:38.005 --> 31:41.947
Perhaps the most judicious move
is to step down from the commission.

31:44.001 --> 31:45.029
Yes.

31:51.017 --> 31:53.957
No.
They'd think I couldn't handle it.

31:53.977 --> 31:56.860
Your safety's more important
than your reputation.

31:56.945 --> 31:59.949
And the AG might even
make the decision for you

31:59.965 --> 32:01.001
in these circumstances.

32:01.017 --> 32:02.933
Being the Royal Commissioner,

32:02.953 --> 32:04.957
only the Queen and Governor-General
can dismiss me.

32:04.977 --> 32:06.025
But there is no shame
in stepping down.

32:06.945 --> 32:09.122
You think I'm safer at home
than here?

32:09.147 --> 32:10.171
No, you're right.

32:10.945 --> 32:14.005
Even if we up the security,
he could still know where you live.

32:14.025 --> 32:17.949
At least let me take your kids
to your mum's, until we know more.

32:17.969 --> 32:20.440
And we have to find you
a secure home base.

32:20.465 --> 32:21.877
Yeah, I'll call her now.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.977
But I'm safer being high-profile.

32:25.989 --> 32:27.949
Hiding in plain sight.

32:28.977 --> 32:30.945
But with precautions, yes?

32:35.989 --> 32:36.985
OK.

32:40.941 --> 32:42.965
I think that's it.
OK, cool.

32:42.981 --> 32:44.953
Thanks.

32:56.945 --> 32:59.949
Hurry up, Mum.
We're going to be late!

32:59.965 --> 33:01.201
You're gonna be late!

33:01.226 --> 33:03.009
We are. Here, grab this.

33:03.025 --> 33:05.973
This one's for you. Give me a hug.

33:08.965 --> 33:12.730
Now, listen, don't let Tony sing
any more of his silly songs, OK?

33:12.945 --> 33:14.953
No!

33:14.973 --> 33:17.268
Off we go, off you go! Come on.
Come on.

33:17.293 --> 33:19.470
Come on, come on.
Quick, quick, quick!

33:28.945 --> 33:30.997
No singing, Uncle Tony!

33:31.017 --> 33:33.076
Byeeee!
Say hello to Grandma for me.

33:33.949 --> 33:36.832
Now, give me a big kiss,
give me a kiss. Love you.

33:38.021 --> 33:40.969
A kiss on the lips.
I know, I loved it.

33:42.957 --> 33:45.016
I'll speak to you tonight, alright?

33:46.981 --> 33:49.957
Thanks, Tony.
It's only temporary.

33:49.977 --> 33:51.957
You got through it before,
you'll get through it again.

33:51.973 --> 33:53.937
Now, who's up for a song?

33:53.953 --> 33:55.013
No!

33:55.933 --> 33:58.404
Their obedience to their mother
sickens me.

33:58.429 --> 34:00.433
Alright.
Bye.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.953
And let's go.

34:23.981 --> 34:25.985
Federal Police have completely
locked the place down

34:26.001 --> 34:27.976
for the Felix operation.

34:27.993 --> 34:29.945
It's lucky you can stay too.

34:29.965 --> 34:31.945
They mustn't think you're too much
of a security threat.

34:31.960 --> 34:32.945
Thanks.

34:35.005 --> 34:37.009
OK, this'll be your room here.

34:38.029 --> 34:42.016
I'm next door, and there's a room
down there for operations.

34:42.933 --> 34:44.933
It's not much, but it's secure.

34:45.937 --> 34:46.996
Will you be OK?

34:47.013 --> 34:48.945
Yeah, I'll be fine.

35:10.025 --> 35:14.029
Chin in, ribs in and breathing in.

35:14.945 --> 35:16.989
Warrior two.

35:19.949 --> 35:22.017
Breathe in and breathe out.

35:29.981 --> 35:31.985
As you sink a little bit lower.

35:34.949 --> 35:37.949
In yoga, we listen to where
our bodies should be,

35:37.965 --> 35:39.945
not where we want to be.

35:41.989 --> 35:44.933
When we do that, we find our truth.

36:08.937 --> 36:10.961
Where are we on Elaheh's
public appeal?

36:10.981 --> 36:13.009
We've had 102 calls that pertain
to the time frame...

36:13.029 --> 36:15.029
Well, look, we don't have time
to check every single one,

36:15.949 --> 36:18.714
so forget the attention-seekers,
yeah? Be smart.

36:19.961 --> 36:20.997
Andy? Bianca?

36:27.953 --> 36:29.957
We'll find an excuse
to take you off the commission.

36:29.973 --> 36:31.941
Seconded to Canberra usually works.

36:31.961 --> 36:35.197
'Cause no-one will wanna visit you?
Oi! I grew up there.

36:35.222 --> 36:38.517
OK, we'll get all your IDs
and your Facebook page set up.

36:38.945 --> 36:40.001
The higher-ups will do their checks
and balances,

36:40.021 --> 36:42.953
but what we will need
is some form of identification.

36:42.973 --> 36:45.797
What's that for?
So, Bianca can prove who she is.

36:45.822 --> 36:47.881
It's, for worst-case scenarios.

36:47.945 --> 36:49.475
I have a tattoo on my hip.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.933
No tattoos.

36:50.953 --> 36:52.961
Only something you know
that you've never told anyone.

36:52.977 --> 36:54.933
Why can't you use a tattoo?

36:54.949 --> 36:56.597
It might not be there.

36:59.937 --> 37:00.957
Richard, not now.

37:00.973 --> 37:02.977
I know, but your ten o'clock?

37:02.993 --> 37:04.013
Shit, thanks.

37:06.013 --> 37:08.072
What about an answer to a question?

37:08.097 --> 37:11.097
Um... the first woman I kissed.

37:14.945 --> 37:15.961
Um, full name?

37:15.977 --> 37:18.945
Alright, excuse me, I have to...

37:18.961 --> 37:24.945
Have you read the affidavit?

37:24.965 --> 37:27.973
I skimmed it at the lights. So,
you found a case in New South Wales?

37:27.989 --> 37:30.029
Well, it's semen, not an embryo,

37:30.949 --> 37:32.973
but it's more recent,
involves the death of a partner,

37:32.993 --> 37:34.973
and they actually go into
whether human tissue

37:34.989 --> 37:36.578
can be considered property.

37:36.945 --> 37:37.985
And?

37:38.005 --> 37:39.941
Well, following the death
of the husband,

37:39.961 --> 37:42.001
the wife wanted to store
the semen sample and not destroy it.

37:42.021 --> 37:44.727
She thought that after he died,
it became hers.

37:44.949 --> 37:48.973
Now, the judge concluded that,
in law and common sense,

37:48.989 --> 37:51.009
the straws of semen are property.

37:51.025 --> 37:52.989
So, following on from that,

37:53.009 --> 37:55.245
the only way Deborah
can get the embryo

37:55.270 --> 37:57.447
is if Ash
specifically gave it to her?

37:57.933 --> 37:58.977
Mm. I've texted you the citation.

37:58.997 --> 38:00.933
Semen and embryos aren't...

38:00.949 --> 38:01.989
Dickhead!

38:02.009 --> 38:04.657
Semen and embryos
aren't quite the same thing,

38:04.937 --> 38:06.977
but, um, good start, thanks.
Mm.

38:06.997 --> 38:10.174
Now also, I'm still looking
into stolen Ferraris and...

38:10.199 --> 38:11.933
Not now, Richard.

38:11.953 --> 38:12.969
Yeah.
Thanks.

38:28.985 --> 38:31.456
I'm sorry I ran out on you
the other night.

38:33.005 --> 38:34.945
What happened?

38:34.961 --> 38:37.017
Um...

38:37.937 --> 38:40.114
I...
I think I had a panic attack.

38:41.993 --> 38:45.941
I thought I was dealing
with Todd's shooting, but, um...

38:45.957 --> 38:47.969
...suddenly, I just...

38:49.977 --> 38:51.953
The worst part was I could...

38:51.973 --> 38:54.915
I could smell the blood
in the bathroom, I could...

38:57.021 --> 38:59.021
Have you had them before?

38:59.941 --> 39:02.353
No. What, do you think
it'll happen again?

39:02.378 --> 39:04.334
Well...

39:04.981 --> 39:08.511
I just wanted to let you know
that it wasn't you or anything.

39:09.001 --> 39:11.178
If you ever get a spare night
again...

39:11.941 --> 39:13.059
I know who to call.

39:13.933 --> 39:14.965
Yeah.

39:31.009 --> 39:32.945
Deborah, would you like to start

39:32.961 --> 39:34.844
with your statement of position?

39:34.869 --> 39:38.781
Mr Cusack's prepared
these written submissions.

39:47.945 --> 39:51.416
I always wanted to have children.
I mean, more than Ash did.

39:52.981 --> 39:55.001
But I didn't find the right partner
till my early 30s.

39:55.021 --> 40:01.009
And we started trying straightaway,
but it just hasn't happened for us.

40:02.933 --> 40:06.051
The doctors have said I can't
become pregnant as I am.

40:06.076 --> 40:09.957
But if I implanted Ash's embryo,
I'd have a real chance,

40:09.973 --> 40:12.985
and the child could share our DNA.

40:13.005 --> 40:17.969
Now, I'm not saying that the embryo
in storage isn't a physical thing,

40:17.989 --> 40:22.961
but it has huge human importance
to me and my family beyond that.

40:22.977 --> 40:24.977
So...

40:26.945 --> 40:29.953
Also, um... Ash and I always said

40:29.973 --> 40:33.091
that we would be each other's donor,
if it came to it.

40:33.116 --> 40:35.128
OK.

40:35.945 --> 40:38.475
Janet, is there something
you'd like to say?

40:41.816 --> 40:43.993
Deb,
I'm not gonna change my position.

40:44.013 --> 40:45.957
I'm in the middle
of a Royal Commission,

40:45.977 --> 40:47.937
and I don't have the time
to give this

40:47.953 --> 40:49.953
the necessary attention right now.

40:49.973 --> 40:52.738
But once that's over,
I promise we can sit down,

40:52.945 --> 40:54.651
we can discuss this properly.

40:54.937 --> 40:55.969
Please don't force this now.

40:55.989 --> 40:58.989
I have no choice because
you won't respond to my calls,

40:59.009 --> 41:00.997
my texts, my emails...
Now's a bad time.

41:01.017 --> 41:02.977
It's always a bad time with you,
Janet.

41:02.997 --> 41:04.957
It might be a good idea
to remind ourselves

41:04.977 --> 41:06.969
that the last thing we want
is a combative atmosphere.

41:06.985 --> 41:08.969
If this goes to a final hearing,

41:08.989 --> 41:12.048
you will lose and that means costs,
which can add up.

41:12.064 --> 41:14.123
Just a few more months, that's all.

41:14.148 --> 41:18.941
I'm running out of time.
I'll take my chances.

41:21.949 --> 41:24.597
Deb, first I'll draw
on established precedents

41:24.945 --> 41:27.021
to argue the embryo is property
and therefore part of Ash's estate.

41:27.941 --> 41:29.969
As her sister,
you have no claim over the estate.

41:29.989 --> 41:32.933
As her partner, I do.
Well, there's a precedent for semen,

41:32.953 --> 41:35.005
but not for embryos.
Secondly, I paid for the IVF,

41:35.025 --> 41:37.849
therefore I own it,
whether it's property or not.

41:37.937 --> 41:38.949
And thirdly...

41:40.005 --> 41:42.953
...Ash would not have wanted you
to have it.

41:42.973 --> 41:45.025
You have no consent.
I do.

41:45.945 --> 41:48.240
Consent as defined
by Sections 16 and 17

41:48.260 --> 41:50.731
of the Assisted Reproductive
Technology Act

41:50.756 --> 41:53.453
requires written consent.

41:54.013 --> 41:57.969
An email from Ashleigh
to Deborah five years ago,

41:57.985 --> 41:59.941
dated 8th September.

42:01.993 --> 42:04.029
'You could always use one of ours.

42:04.949 --> 42:08.714
We've tried twice so far. Maybe
you'll have better luck than me.'

42:08.739 --> 42:11.751
This was sent
before we were pregnant.

42:11.949 --> 42:13.001
You're making suppositions
about Ash's wishes

42:13.017 --> 42:14.949
after the twins were born.

42:14.969 --> 42:18.146
There are over 120,000 embryos
in storage in Australia.

42:18.171 --> 42:20.466
This is the floodgates opening,
Ms King.

42:23.017 --> 42:25.945
You don't just need Ash's consent.

42:25.965 --> 42:28.957
An embryo is made
from an egg and a sperm.

42:29.989 --> 42:33.107
But the donor was anonymous.
You have that in writing?

42:33.132 --> 42:35.088
It was in one of Ash's emails.

42:35.949 --> 42:37.949
His name's Tim Dolan.

42:37.965 --> 42:38.985
We all met at Sydney Uni.

42:39.001 --> 42:40.941
Our friends know who the donor was,

42:40.961 --> 42:44.197
but we deliberately told
everyone else it was anonymous.

42:44.217 --> 42:47.453
How can we accept that this
represents Ash's true wishes

42:47.478 --> 42:52.005
when there's another email, to
Deborah, where we know Ash lied?

42:52.021 --> 42:54.080
You need the sperm donor's consent,

42:54.105 --> 42:56.458
and you can't rely
on Ash's emails alone.

43:02.957 --> 43:06.013
Well, we clearly won't be
settling this today.

43:12.981 --> 43:13.977
Janet.

43:50.021 --> 43:52.953
Hi, Tim, it's Janet.

43:52.969 --> 43:55.028
Um, look, I know it's been a while,

43:55.053 --> 43:56.037
but...

43:57.981 --> 44:00.945
...could you call me
when you get this, please?

44:00.961 --> 44:03.969
It's urgent. Thanks.

44:19.009 --> 44:22.009
'It's been a pretty shitful time,
to be honest.

44:22.029 --> 44:25.937
I loved Janet's drive
when we were falling in love.

44:25.953 --> 44:27.365
Her intellect, her guts.

44:27.933 --> 44:32.051
But more often these days, I feel
like I'm just an obstacle in her way.

44:33.985 --> 44:36.997
I shouldn't bitch.
She's my entire world.

44:38.017 --> 44:40.961
I just can't help feeling
a little sad sometimes

44:40.981 --> 44:45.276
that she devotes so much of her time
to restoring the rights of strangers,

44:45.301 --> 44:48.253
and the result is
people closest to her suffer.'

44:53.985 --> 44:54.981
Hey.

44:54.997 --> 44:57.949
Andy told me about the DNA link

44:57.969 --> 45:00.001
between George's killer
and Ash's killer.

45:00.021 --> 45:03.316
You know we can send that away
for more thorough testing?

45:03.341 --> 45:03.965
For what?

45:03.985 --> 45:06.937
Hereditary traits,
about hair and eye colour.

45:07.997 --> 45:11.233
We can't identify George's killer
through his DNA alone.

45:11.945 --> 45:14.416
I mean, science isn't that good yet,
is it?

45:14.441 --> 45:15.973
It's getting there.

45:15.993 --> 45:18.953
If you knew he was
a blue-eyed blonde,

45:18.973 --> 45:20.949
that'd narrow the field at least,
right?

45:20.969 --> 45:23.965
We use DNA as an identification
tool, not an investigative tool.

45:23.981 --> 45:24.965
Not yet.

45:24.985 --> 45:27.017
There are tests that can give you
the morphology of the face

45:27.937 --> 45:29.017
just from the saliva
on the rim of a glass.

45:29.937 --> 45:30.997
Hang on,
Janet can't use public funds

45:31.013 --> 45:32.961
to solve her partner's death.

45:32.981 --> 45:34.969
She'd be after George Healy's
killer, that's all.

45:34.989 --> 45:37.953
Sure, and I can't think of any other
unsolved investigation

45:37.969 --> 45:39.675
that that test might benefit.

45:39.937 --> 45:42.977
We've already tested the DNA
to confirm sex and ancestry.

45:42.997 --> 45:44.997
There's a test in Holland
that can give you eye colour,

45:45.017 --> 45:48.135
hair colour, freckles, complexion,
behavioural traits,

45:48.160 --> 45:49.965
its left or right-handedness.

45:49.985 --> 45:52.868
If I order this test
through the commission, it...

45:52.945 --> 45:54.009
...it could look self-serving.

45:54.029 --> 45:57.677
Well, I can make a case for it,
but it wouldn't be fast-tracked

45:57.937 --> 45:59.820
without the commission attached.

46:03.989 --> 46:06.961
OK, a happy medium.
But it's all about George.

46:06.977 --> 46:07.989
Absolutely.

46:08.009 --> 46:10.953
Completely.
As if that'll pass the pub test.

46:11.985 --> 46:12.997
See you tomorrow.

46:28.985 --> 46:30.009
Hey.
Hey.

46:30.029 --> 46:31.957
I'm early.
That's OK.

46:34.009 --> 46:36.013
Wow, that's a great outfit.

46:36.029 --> 46:38.965
These are my clothes. Kidding.

46:40.937 --> 46:44.937
Um, listen, before the others
get here, I just, um...

46:47.941 --> 46:49.706
It's not too late to pull out.

46:50.981 --> 46:53.965
I mean it. It's a great opportunity,
but your safety is paramount.

46:53.981 --> 46:54.965
Hey.

46:54.985 --> 46:58.941
Great things
never came from comfort zones.

47:04.025 --> 47:07.001
Kirsty here'll do your face.
Hi, come through.

47:07.021 --> 47:09.937
Found a place that does these
amazing pear and oatmeal things.

47:09.953 --> 47:11.365
I'm officially obsessed.

47:11.390 --> 47:12.374
Thanks.

47:15.965 --> 47:17.969
So, where do we start?

47:22.981 --> 47:25.017
Your full name, for the record.

47:25.933 --> 47:28.009
Felix John Murphy.

47:28.029 --> 47:32.206
Mr Murphy, is it true that last year
you amassed a large amount of debt?

47:32.231 --> 47:35.001
Yes.
I wanted to win my fiancee back.

47:35.021 --> 47:38.981
And the money you borrowed,
you gambled, correct?

47:38.997 --> 47:40.997
I had a win here and there.

47:41.017 --> 47:45.985
Won 13 grand one night, but then
lost it the next two nights, so...

47:46.005 --> 47:48.417
...basically, yeah,
I went into more debt.

47:48.945 --> 47:52.945
Do you gamble now, Mr Murphy?
Not for eight months.

47:52.965 --> 47:56.945
How do you feel today compared to
when you were a problem gambler?

47:56.961 --> 47:58.009
Healthy.

47:58.025 --> 48:00.969
When I was at a real low point,

48:00.989 --> 48:04.225
I bet at my laptop for a week,
living off a bag of rice.

48:04.250 --> 48:09.013
But now I'm back working as a chef,
growing my own veggies,

48:09.029 --> 48:12.937
just enjoying the everyday things.

48:15.953 --> 48:18.071
Who shot you in the knee, Mr Murphy?

48:19.985 --> 48:21.013
I don't know who.

48:21.933 --> 48:24.009
This person, or persons,
took you to Lansdowne Park,

48:24.029 --> 48:26.961
walked you to a secluded area
and shot you in the knee,

48:26.981 --> 48:29.334
and you have no idea
what they look like?

48:29.359 --> 48:31.771
I was shot in the knee,
but not like that.

48:31.949 --> 48:33.981
Could you give the commission your
account of what happened that day?

48:34.001 --> 48:36.969
I went for a walk in Lansdowne Park.

48:36.985 --> 48:40.957
I decided to lie down in the sun.

48:40.977 --> 48:44.977
A shadow came over me,
that's the last thing I remember.

48:44.993 --> 48:46.288
I woke up in Westmead.

48:46.945 --> 48:48.985
Do you think you were shot
by someone to whom you owed money?

48:49.001 --> 48:50.933
I don't know who it was.

48:54.029 --> 48:57.937
Mr Murphy, I want to be
perfectly clear about this.

48:57.957 --> 49:00.945
If I find that you are deliberately
misleading this commission,

49:00.961 --> 49:01.997
I can have you charged with

49:02.017 --> 49:04.547
attempting to pervert
the course of justice.

49:04.572 --> 49:06.001
I understand.

49:06.021 --> 49:09.009
Brown hair, blonde hair, glasses?
Couldn't say?

49:09.029 --> 49:13.945
I didn't see them.
Mr Murphy, this is your last chance.

49:13.965 --> 49:17.260
Please describe to this commission
who shot you that day.

49:39.985 --> 49:41.021
Sorry.

50:22.985 --> 50:25.044
Please tell me
you're not on Tinder.

50:25.953 --> 50:28.248
Honey's honey
wherever you find the bee.

50:29.953 --> 50:33.306
No, it's my niece getting ready
for her ballet Eisteddfod.

50:33.981 --> 50:37.021
Sweet.

50:43.021 --> 50:46.374
Sorry, but did you come off
that commission thing as well?

50:50.013 --> 50:51.957
The one on guns?

50:57.021 --> 50:59.029
How long have you been here?

50:59.949 --> 51:03.957
Since yesterday. I think
they're gonna recall me today.

51:03.973 --> 51:06.953
Yeah, yeah, they told me the same.

51:08.961 --> 51:11.491
'See how you feel
after a night in lock-up'.

51:11.937 --> 51:16.009
Such bullshit. I don't know
what they want me to tell them.

51:16.029 --> 51:19.029
Yeah, someone gets shot
on Australia Day,

51:19.949 --> 51:22.714
and suddenly
we're all part of a big conspiracy.

51:23.945 --> 51:25.122
They've got no idea.

51:27.937 --> 51:28.933
Still...

51:30.029 --> 51:32.017
...maybe I'm better off in here.

51:32.933 --> 51:34.933
We should take her out now.

51:35.945 --> 51:39.651
You were lucky to have scored
an invite. Leave him wanting more.

51:40.001 --> 51:42.237
Just saying,
but you're in charge here.

52:02.021 --> 52:03.969
Am I going back to court?

52:03.989 --> 52:07.519
They're letting you go. You can
phone someone to pick you up.

52:23.965 --> 52:25.953
I told you at the start
of this operation

52:25.973 --> 52:28.001
that nothing you say
and no information you give

52:28.021 --> 52:31.257
can be used against you
in any court in New South Wales.

52:31.282 --> 52:33.298
This inducement has now ended.

52:35.981 --> 52:38.985
I just, um...
I don't think we connected.

52:39.001 --> 52:41.993
He, um... He didn't get my name.

52:42.009 --> 52:43.993
He'll remember you.

52:47.977 --> 52:48.989
Best on ground.

52:55.953 --> 52:57.009
Lina?

52:59.029 --> 53:00.993
Yeah, I'm on my way.

53:02.949 --> 53:04.597
She's got something on Todd.

53:09.933 --> 53:13.757
Four hours before he was killed,
Todd visited a cafe in Glenfield.

53:13.993 --> 53:17.001
3:30. Where is this?
Railway Parade.

53:17.021 --> 53:20.433
He bought two coffees -
one for him, one for his passenger.

53:21.953 --> 53:24.953
Guy or girl?
Can't tell with that camera.

53:24.973 --> 53:27.973
We'll get RMS footage within a
ten-kay radius, see where they went.

53:27.989 --> 53:29.989
We did that already.

53:30.009 --> 53:33.127
What made you prioritise
this tip over all the others?

53:33.949 --> 53:35.965
Well, the cafe owner
was the only person

53:35.981 --> 53:37.969
to describe Todd in a nice way.

53:37.989 --> 53:39.029
Everyone else said
he was this suss-looking guy,

53:39.949 --> 53:42.832
whereas this person said
he was happy, very happy.

53:42.857 --> 53:44.861
And he paid with a $100 bill.

53:44.997 --> 53:47.762
Hey, hey, stop for a second,
I've got something.

53:47.945 --> 53:50.651
We're a little busy, Richard.
No, no, but this.

53:50.965 --> 53:52.973
If Todd was trying to steal
Bocarro's Ferrari

53:52.993 --> 53:55.969
because he had an order for one,
he'd try again, right?

53:55.989 --> 53:58.342
Because if he did steal one,
and sold it,

53:58.362 --> 54:00.657
then that would explain
all of his cash.

54:00.682 --> 54:03.985
So, I looked up who else in Sydney
has a Ferrari 458,

54:04.005 --> 54:07.182
and guess who bought one
two days before Todd was shot?

54:07.207 --> 54:09.227
Our friend from the inquest.

54:11.029 --> 54:13.945
Major Simon Hamilton.

54:16.021 --> 54:20.017
See, Todd's looking to steal
a Ferrari. Simon Hamilton buys one.

54:20.937 --> 54:23.957
Two days later, Todd is dead
with a pile of cash in his car?

54:23.977 --> 54:25.989
How does an army major
afford a car like that?

54:26.009 --> 54:28.953
But Todd doesn't have any connection
to Simon Hamilton at all.

54:28.973 --> 54:31.032
It doesn't make sense.
Yes, it does.

54:31.057 --> 54:33.033
This is RMS footage.

54:36.977 --> 54:38.933
That's Holsworthy.

54:38.949 --> 54:39.981
The army base.

54:50.013 --> 54:51.969
Karen Parker?

54:54.981 --> 54:56.965
...have a boy or a girl.

54:56.985 --> 55:00.044
I wanted the surprise,
and he agreed to wait and see.

55:01.993 --> 55:05.229
When he died, I decided
to find out like he'd wanted to.

55:07.977 --> 55:08.993
Our son...

55:10.981 --> 55:13.158
...he'll never know
his father's love.

55:13.989 --> 55:18.961
He'll never hold his hand
or ride on his shoulders.

55:20.025 --> 55:23.997
Someone saw Todd before he died.
Someone knows something.

55:25.013 --> 55:27.965
If you saw Todd on Australia Day,

55:27.985 --> 55:30.933
if you know anything
that could be relevant...

55:31.985 --> 55:33.981
...please contact the police.

55:43.021 --> 55:45.957
Tim's here.
What is your position, Mr Dolan?

55:45.973 --> 55:47.005
It's not your place to come in...

55:47.025 --> 55:49.001
It actually is my place
because it's my child

55:49.021 --> 55:51.257
I'd be putting in
this toxic situation.

55:51.282 --> 55:52.989
Have we met before?
Far out.

55:53.005 --> 55:54.937
We have.

55:54.957 --> 55:56.017
It's in the past,
it's not who I am.

55:56.883 --> 55:58.001
Richard and Keisha?

55:58.017 --> 55:59.985
You call Richard and you tell him

56:00.005 --> 56:01.969
you want him back
at the office immediately.

56:01.989 --> 56:03.973
Your extended family
were desperate for answers.

56:03.993 --> 56:06.957
Yeah, and so am I!
I don't know what Todd was up to.

56:06.977 --> 56:10.448
