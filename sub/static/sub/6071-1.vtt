00:29.851 --> 00:30.971
Aah!

00:33.972 --> 00:35.172
Wee-be-be-bee.

00:35.292 --> 00:36.971
Will you take a look at that?

00:37.051 --> 00:38.571
Pretty pathetic, huh?

00:38.691 --> 00:40.091
Well, you'll never
believe this,

00:40.171 --> 00:41.412
but that llama
you're looking at

00:41.532 --> 00:43.212
was once a human being

00:43.332 --> 00:44.892
And not just
any human being

00:45.012 --> 00:46.332
That guy was an emperor

00:46.452 --> 00:48.453
A rich, powerful ball
of charisma

00:48.573 --> 00:49.533
Oh, yeah!

00:50.853 --> 00:52.132
This is his story

00:53.292 --> 00:55.092
Well, actually my story

00:55.212 --> 00:58.013
That's right--
I'm that llama

00:58.133 --> 01:00.333
The name is Kuzco

01:00.413 --> 01:02.734
Emperor Kuzco

01:02.854 --> 01:04.694
I was the world's
nicest guy,

01:04.813 --> 01:06.373
and they ruined my life
for no reason

01:06.493 --> 01:08.133
Oh, is that hard to believe?

01:08.213 --> 01:09.974
Look, I tell you what
You go back away--

01:10.054 --> 01:12.134
you know, before
I was a llama,

01:12.214 --> 01:13.574
and this will all make sense

01:13.694 --> 01:16.534
All right, now see,
that's a little too far back

01:16.614 --> 01:18.455
Oh, ho! Look at me!

01:18.575 --> 01:19.934
That's me as a baby

01:20.054 --> 01:21.854
Waah!

01:23.254 --> 01:25.455
Ahem! All right,
let' smove ahead

01:43.336 --> 01:44.896
Oh, yeah.

01:45.016 --> 01:46.977
Theme song guy: There are
despots and dictators

01:47.097 --> 01:49.176
Political manipulators

01:49.296 --> 01:53.737
There are blue bloods
with the intellects of fleas

01:53.857 --> 01:55.897
There are kings
and catty tyrants

01:56.017 --> 01:58.857
Who are so lacking
in refinements

01:58.937 --> 02:00.977
They'd be better suited
swinging from the trees

02:02.697 --> 02:04.737
He was born and raised
to rule

02:04.857 --> 02:07.097
No one has ever been
as cool

02:07.217 --> 02:10.258
In a thousand years
of aristocracy

02:11.858 --> 02:14.138
An enigma and a mystery

02:14.218 --> 02:16.338
In Mesoamerican history

02:16.458 --> 02:19.658
The quintessence of
perfection that is he

02:21.378 --> 02:22.698
Ok, this is the real me

02:22.818 --> 02:23.699
Not this

02:23.859 --> 02:25.019
- This
- Not this.

02:25.139 --> 02:26.579
- Winner!
- Loser.

02:26.739 --> 02:28.779
Ok, see this palace?

02:28.899 --> 02:30.339
Everyone in it
is at my command

02:30.419 --> 02:31.379
Check this out

02:32.459 --> 02:33.699
Butler.

02:33.819 --> 02:35.819
Chef.

02:35.899 --> 02:37.219
Theme song guy.

02:37.299 --> 02:38.700
Oh, yeah!

02:38.780 --> 02:41.100
He's the sovereign lord
of the nation

02:41.220 --> 02:43.580
He's the hippest cat
in creation

02:43.700 --> 02:46.380
He's the alpha,
the omega, A to Z

02:47.900 --> 02:49.740
And this perfect world
will spin

02:49.860 --> 02:51.980
Around his every
little whim

02:52.060 --> 02:54.981
'Cause this perfect world
begins and ends with

02:55.101 --> 02:55.981
Me.

02:56.101 --> 02:57.101
What's his name?

02:57.221 --> 03:00.981
Kuzco

03:01.101 --> 03:02.221
That's his name

03:02.341 --> 03:03.941
Kuzco

03:04.061 --> 03:06.341
He's the king
of the world

03:06.421 --> 03:08.422
Kuzco

03:08.542 --> 03:10.182
Is he hip or what?

03:10.262 --> 03:12.102
Kuzco

03:12.181 --> 03:13.781
Yeah

03:15.582 --> 03:17.422
Gow!

03:17.582 --> 03:19.222
You threw off my groove!

03:19.342 --> 03:21.263
I'm sorry,
but you've thrown off

03:21.343 --> 03:23.623
the emperor's groove.

03:23.743 --> 03:25.583
Sorry!

03:25.663 --> 03:27.422
You were saying?

03:27.542 --> 03:34.063
What's his name?
Kuzco

03:34.223 --> 03:37.224
Kuzco

03:37.704 --> 03:39.864
That's his name

03:41.863 --> 03:44.184
Is he hip or what?

03:44.304 --> 03:48.624
Don't you know he's
the king of the world?

03:48.784 --> 03:53.145
Whoa, yeah

03:53.265 --> 03:54.425
Oww!

03:56.664 --> 03:57.584
Ha!

03:57.664 --> 03:58.585
Boom, baby!

03:58.825 --> 04:00.305
Aah! Your Highness,

04:00.385 --> 04:02.065
it is time for you
to choose your bride.

04:02.185 --> 04:03.545
Allrighty

04:03.625 --> 04:06.106
Trot out
the ladies

04:06.226 --> 04:07.186
Let's take a look-see.

04:07.266 --> 04:09.705
Hate your hair.
Not likely.

04:09.785 --> 04:11.865
Yikes, yikes, yikes,

04:11.945 --> 04:13.426
and let me guess.

04:13.506 --> 04:15.586
You have
a great personality.

04:15.706 --> 04:17.546
Is this really
the best you could do?

04:17.625 --> 04:19.906
Oh, yes. Oh, no.
I mean, perhaps--

04:20.027 --> 04:21.707
What
is he babbling about?

04:21.786 --> 04:24.146
He's like the thing
that wouldn't shut up

04:24.266 --> 04:28.027
Anyway, still wondering about
that llama in the opening?

04:29.107 --> 04:32.267
Well, let me show you the people
responsible for ruining my life

04:33.907 --> 04:36.428
First, there's Pacha

04:36.548 --> 04:37.427
Uh, excuse me.

04:37.547 --> 04:39.107
I'm here to see
Emperor Kuzco.

04:39.227 --> 04:40.787
You see,
I got this summons--

04:40.907 --> 04:42.628
Inside, up the stairs,
and to the left

04:42.748 --> 04:44.428
Just follow the signs

04:44.508 --> 04:47.428
Oh, great.
Thanks a lot.

04:47.508 --> 04:51.508
Uh, and don't be fooled
by the folksy peasant look

04:51.628 --> 04:53.068
Oh!

04:53.228 --> 04:55.108
Pardon me
That's mine

04:55.228 --> 04:56.149
Oh, here you go.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.629
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:58.749 --> 05:00.429
Aah! Oh, hey.
Are you all right?

05:00.509 --> 05:01.429
Here. Let me, uh--

05:01.509 --> 05:02.349
Oh, you're
so very kind.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.349
What happened?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.350
Well, I...

05:04.470 --> 05:06.429
I threw off
the emperor's groove.

05:06.509 --> 05:07.629
- What?
- His groove!

05:07.749 --> 05:09.149
The rhythm in which
he lives his life,

05:09.229 --> 05:10.469
his pattern of behavior.

05:10.589 --> 05:11.590
I threw it off,

05:11.710 --> 05:14.110
and the emperor had me
thrown out the window.

05:14.190 --> 05:16.310
Oh, really?

05:16.430 --> 05:17.510
I'm supposed
to see him today.

05:17.670 --> 05:18.871
Don't throw off
his groove!

05:18.991 --> 05:19.950
Oh, ok.

05:20.030 --> 05:21.710
Beware the groove.

05:21.830 --> 05:23.150
Hey, are you
gonna be all right?

05:23.270 --> 05:24.790
Groove.

05:24.910 --> 05:26.551
Kuzco: You see
what I mean?

05:26.671 --> 05:29.471
This guy's trouble,
but as bad as he is,

05:29.551 --> 05:31.671
he is nothing compared
to what's coming up next

05:32.111 --> 05:33.112
And why have you
come here today?

05:33.951 --> 05:34.871
Well

05:34.951 --> 05:37.951
Your Highness--
I mean, Your Grace.

05:38.031 --> 05:40.432
Ok, gang
Check out this piece of work

05:40.512 --> 05:43.512
This is Yzma,
the emperor's advisor--

05:43.632 --> 05:46.592
living proof that dinosaurs
once roamed the Earth

05:46.672 --> 05:49.072
And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man

05:49.152 --> 05:51.072
Every decade or so
she gets a new one

05:51.152 --> 05:52.872
This year's model
is called Kronk

05:55.313 --> 05:57.073
Yeah, I got
that there, Yzma.

05:58.913 --> 05:59.793
Unh!

05:59.913 --> 06:01.753
Yep, that's Kronk

06:01.833 --> 06:04.873
Now lately, Yzma's
gotten into this bad habit

06:04.993 --> 06:07.273
of trying to run the country
behind my back,

06:07.353 --> 06:09.354
and I知 thinkin'
that's got to stop

06:09.514 --> 06:11.514
It is no concern
of mine

06:11.634 --> 06:12.594
whether your family
has...

06:12.714 --> 06:13.754
What was it again?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.394
Um, food.

06:15.514 --> 06:17.634
Ha! You really should
have thought of that

06:17.754 --> 06:19.514
before you
became peasants.

06:19.634 --> 06:20.714
We're through here.

06:20.834 --> 06:22.754
Take him away. Next!

06:22.834 --> 06:24.475
But l--

06:24.595 --> 06:26.075
Oh, ok.

06:28.075 --> 06:29.595
Ugh.

06:29.714 --> 06:31.675
The nerve of some
of those peasants, huh?

06:31.755 --> 06:34.035
Tell me about it.
Aah!

06:34.155 --> 06:35.115
Hi there.

06:35.235 --> 06:36.595
Ooh, Your Highness.

06:36.675 --> 06:37.595
Ahem.

06:37.675 --> 06:40.076
Oh, oh, oh,
ha ha ha. Um...

06:40.196 --> 06:41.636
Uh, you were
doing it again.

06:41.716 --> 06:44.555
Doing? Doing...
Doing what?

06:44.675 --> 06:45.796
Doing my job.

06:45.876 --> 06:46.796
I'm the emperor,

06:46.876 --> 06:48.356
and you're the emperor's
advisor.

06:48.516 --> 06:49.356
Remember that?

06:49.516 --> 06:50.636
But, Your Highness,

06:50.716 --> 06:53.357
I was only dealing with
meaningless peasant matters.

06:53.437 --> 06:54.357
Whoa

06:54.437 --> 06:57.197
Look at these wrinkles

06:57.357 --> 07:00.277
What is holding
this woman together?

07:00.397 --> 07:01.957
What the--

07:02.037 --> 07:03.797
How long
has that been there?

07:03.877 --> 07:05.357
Good thinkin', Yzma

07:05.437 --> 07:06.357
What do you say,
Kuzco?

07:06.477 --> 07:07.838
Whoa! No touchy!

07:07.918 --> 07:10.078
No touchy.
No touch.

07:10.198 --> 07:11.158
Excuse me,
Your Highness

07:11.238 --> 07:12.677
The village leader
is here to see you.

07:12.757 --> 07:14.317
Oh, great.
Send him in.

07:14.397 --> 07:15.878
Oh, and by the way,
you're fired.

07:15.958 --> 07:17.118
Fired?

07:17.238 --> 07:19.638
W-W-What do you mean,
fired?

07:19.758 --> 07:20.878
Um, how else
can I say it?

07:20.998 --> 07:22.359
You're being let go,

07:22.439 --> 07:23.919
your department's
being downsized,

07:23.999 --> 07:25.439
you're part of
an outplacement,

07:25.599 --> 07:26.718
we're going in a
different direction,

07:26.838 --> 07:27.758
we're not picking
up your option...

07:27.878 --> 07:29.399
Take your pick.
I got more.

07:29.559 --> 07:31.639
But l-- You--uh--

07:31.759 --> 07:32.999
Uhh.

07:33.079 --> 07:35.399
But--
But, Your Highness,

07:35.479 --> 07:38.080
I have been nothing
if not loyal to the empire

07:38.200 --> 07:41.199
for--for--for
many, many years.

07:41.319 --> 07:43.799
Hey, hey, everybody
hits their stride.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.720
You just hit yours
50 years ago.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.760
So...who's
in my chair?

07:49.880 --> 07:50.760
Oh, oh! I know!

07:50.880 --> 07:51.761
Yzma.

07:51.881 --> 07:53.241
Yzma's in your
chair, right?

07:53.361 --> 07:55.040
Very good, Kronk.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.200
Here. Get the snack.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.880
Got it!

07:58.000 --> 07:59.241
Unh! Oof!.

07:59.321 --> 08:00.241
Ok, you heard
the man.

08:00.321 --> 08:01.241
Up, up, up.

08:01.321 --> 08:03.481
I知 ok
I'm fine

08:05.001 --> 08:06.362
Ah.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.761
ok. Show him in.

08:11.961 --> 08:12.881
Ahem.

08:13.001 --> 08:14.602
Uh, afternoon,
Your Highness.

08:14.722 --> 08:16.442
I'm here because
I received a summons--

08:16.562 --> 08:17.442
Hey,
there he is!

08:17.562 --> 08:19.362
My main village man.

08:19.442 --> 08:20.843
Um, Pacha.

08:20.923 --> 08:22.762
Anyway, I got
this summons--

08:22.882 --> 08:24.282
Pacha.

08:24.402 --> 08:25.722
That's right.

08:25.802 --> 08:27.522
You are just the man
I wanted to see.

08:27.603 --> 08:28.843
I am?

08:28.923 --> 08:31.203
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

08:33.363 --> 08:35.604
You can fix my problem,
can't you?

08:35.724 --> 08:37.883
Sure.
I'll do what I can.

08:38.003 --> 08:40.482
Good, good. That's just
what I wanted to hear.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.284
Are you aware of
just how important

08:42.404 --> 08:43.724
your village is
to the empire?

08:43.804 --> 08:45.564
Well, I know
we grow the crops

08:45.724 --> 08:46.964
that you use here
at the palace.

08:47.084 --> 08:48.884
We also herd the llamas
that you--

08:51.844 --> 08:53.604
My village?

08:53.724 --> 08:54.684
Oh, yeah.

08:54.764 --> 08:56.845
You got a pretty sweet
little setup there

08:56.925 --> 08:59.445
on top of that hill,
don't you? Ha ha ha!

08:59.565 --> 09:01.925
Yeah. My family has
lived on that hilltop

09:02.005 --> 09:04.246
for the last
6 generations.

09:04.366 --> 09:05.565
Uh-huh.

09:05.685 --> 09:07.085
So tell me,

09:07.205 --> 09:09.405
where do you find
you get the most sun?

09:09.485 --> 09:10.645
Oh, I'd say

09:10.765 --> 09:13.846
just on the other side
of those trees.

09:13.926 --> 09:16.126
When the sun hits
that ridge just right,

09:16.246 --> 09:18.406
these hills sing.

09:18.486 --> 09:19.726
Well, that settles it.

09:19.886 --> 09:20.766
Really?

09:20.886 --> 09:22.046
Yep. Problem solved.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.246
Thanks for coming.

09:23.366 --> 09:24.286
That's it?

09:24.366 --> 09:25.806
That's all
you wanted me for?

09:25.926 --> 09:27.887
I just needed
an insider's opinion

09:27.967 --> 09:30.447
before I ok'd this spot
for my pool.

09:30.607 --> 09:32.927
Uh...your pool?

09:33.007 --> 09:33.927
Boo-yah!

09:34.007 --> 09:35.607
Welcome to
Kuzcotopia,

09:35.687 --> 09:37.287
my ultimate
summer getaway

09:37.447 --> 09:39.167
complete
with water slide.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.768
What?

09:40.888 --> 09:41.808
Isn't it great?

09:41.888 --> 09:43.968
It's my birthday gift
to me. Ha!

09:44.088 --> 09:45.768
I'm so happy.

09:45.848 --> 09:47.848
Uh...uh...

09:47.968 --> 09:50.808
um...l don't understand
how this could happen.

09:50.888 --> 09:52.568
Well, let me
clear it up for you.

09:52.648 --> 09:54.688
At my birthday
celebration tomorrow,

09:54.808 --> 09:55.689
I give the word,

09:55.809 --> 09:57.369
and your town
will be destroyed

09:57.489 --> 09:59.729
to make way for this...

10:05.569 --> 10:06.529
So, if I were you,

10:06.649 --> 10:07.849
I'd pick up some
change-of-address forms

10:07.969 --> 10:08.889
on the way home.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.130
But, um,
where will we live?

10:11.210 --> 10:13.010
Hmm...

10:13.130 --> 10:14.170
Don't know,
don't care.

10:14.290 --> 10:15.170
How's that?

10:15.290 --> 10:16.929
Oh, but wait.
You can't--

10:20.610 --> 10:22.450
When I give the word,

10:22.530 --> 10:26.531
your little town thingy
will be bye-bye.

10:26.651 --> 10:27.811
Bye-bye!

10:27.891 --> 10:29.411
Oh, w--wait. No--

10:29.531 --> 10:31.170
Heh heh. Boohoo.

10:31.250 --> 10:34.491
Oh, yeah
Everything was goin' my way

10:35.731 --> 10:37.491
Or so I thought

10:37.731 --> 10:39.532
He can't get rid of me
that easily.

10:39.612 --> 10:43.692
Who does that ungrateful
little worm think he is?

10:43.771 --> 10:44.691
Does he...

10:44.811 --> 10:46.292
A little to the left.

10:47.452 --> 10:50.092
...have any idea of
who he's dealing with?

10:50.172 --> 10:51.372
How could he
do this to me?

10:51.452 --> 10:54.213
Why, I practically
raised him.

10:54.293 --> 10:56.173
Yeah, you think he
would've turned out better.

10:56.293 --> 10:58.132
Yeah, go figure.

10:58.212 --> 11:00.212
Well, it's better you're
takin' out your anger

11:00.292 --> 11:02.213
on these things instead
of the real Kuzco, huh?

11:02.293 --> 11:04.653
That's it, Kronk!

11:04.733 --> 11:05.653
- That's it!

11:05.733 --> 11:08.614
I'll get rid of Kuzco.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

11:08.694 --> 11:10.494
The real Kuzco?

11:10.614 --> 11:12.973
Of course
the real Kuzco.

11:13.133 --> 11:14.853
Don't you see?
It's perfect.

11:14.973 --> 11:17.374
With him out of the way
and no heir to the throne,

11:17.494 --> 11:20.694
I'll take over
and rule the empire.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.054
Brilliant!

11:22.174 --> 11:23.615
So how does that work

11:23.735 --> 11:25.295
with you bein' fired
and all?

11:25.375 --> 11:27.894
The only ones who know
about that are the three of us,

11:28.014 --> 11:29.734
soon to be the two of us.

11:29.854 --> 11:31.815
And I'm one of
those two, right?

11:32.055 --> 11:32.935
To the secret lab!

11:35.175 --> 11:37.736
Pull the lever, Kronk.

11:37.816 --> 11:38.856
Wrong lever!

11:39.976 --> 11:40.855
Huh?

11:40.975 --> 11:43.655
Why do we even
have that lever?

11:45.056 --> 11:46.936
Get out of my way!

11:49.336 --> 11:50.576
Please remain seated

11:50.656 --> 11:52.137
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times

11:52.257 --> 11:53.257
Whee!

11:53.377 --> 11:55.536
Faster, faster!

11:55.656 --> 11:58.176
Yzma, put your hands
in the air!

11:58.296 --> 12:00.617
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

12:04.897 --> 12:07.218
Ah, how shall I do it?

12:07.338 --> 12:09.137
Oh, I know.

12:09.257 --> 12:10.977
I'll turn him
into a flea,

12:11.097 --> 12:12.897
a harmless little flea,

12:13.017 --> 12:14.778
and then I'll
put that flea in a box,

12:14.858 --> 12:16.858
and then I'll put that box
inside of another box,

12:16.938 --> 12:18.698
and then I'll
mail that box to myself,

12:18.818 --> 12:19.818
and when it arrives,

12:19.938 --> 12:20.978
Ah ha ha ha!

12:21.099 --> 12:23.818
I'll smash it
with a hammer!

12:23.898 --> 12:26.298
It's brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant, I tell you!

12:26.418 --> 12:27.298
Genius, I say!

12:32.579 --> 12:34.099
Or, to save on postage,

12:34.219 --> 12:36.380
I'll just poison him
with this.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.819
Take it, Kronk.

12:37.899 --> 12:40.339
Oh ho ho ho.
Feel the power.

12:40.419 --> 12:41.339
Oh...

12:41.419 --> 12:42.499
I can feel it.

12:42.619 --> 12:44.700
Our moment of
triumph approaches.

12:44.820 --> 12:46.420
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

12:46.540 --> 12:48.500
It's dinner time.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.861
So...is everything
ready for tonight?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.141
Oh, yeah. I thought
we'd start off

13:02.261 --> 13:03.421
with soup
and a light salad

13:03.581 --> 13:04.981
and then see how
we feel after that.

13:05.061 --> 13:07.301
Not the dinner...

13:07.461 --> 13:08.461
The you know.

13:08.541 --> 13:10.861
Oh, right.
The poison--

13:10.981 --> 13:12.302
The poison for Kuzco,

13:12.382 --> 13:14.702
the poison chosen
specially to kill Kuzco,

13:14.822 --> 13:15.862
Kuzco's poison.

13:17.062 --> 13:17.982
That poison?

13:18.062 --> 13:18.981
Yes! That poison.

13:19.061 --> 13:20.142
Got you covered.

13:20.262 --> 13:21.462
Excellent.

13:21.582 --> 13:23.582
A few drops in his drink,

13:23.662 --> 13:25.022
then I'll propose a toast,

13:25.102 --> 13:26.783
and he will be dead
before dessert.

13:26.943 --> 13:28.263
Which is a real shame,

13:28.343 --> 13:29.423
because it's gonna
be delicious.

13:30.503 --> 13:31.543
Boom, bam, baby!

13:31.663 --> 13:33.023
Let's
get to the grub

13:33.142 --> 13:36.023
I am one hungry
king of the world.

13:36.103 --> 13:40.383
So...no hard feelings
about being let go?

13:40.503 --> 13:42.664
None whatsoever.

13:43.744 --> 13:47.303
Kronk, get
the emperor a drink.

13:47.383 --> 13:50.544
Drink. Right.

14:06.225 --> 14:07.425
Your Highness.

14:08.745 --> 14:10.025
Is something burning?

14:10.145 --> 14:11.706
My spinach puffs!

14:17.345 --> 14:18.506
Ahem.

14:18.626 --> 14:21.426
So... he seems...

14:21.546 --> 14:22.506
nice.

14:22.626 --> 14:24.426
Heh. He is.

14:25.827 --> 14:29.027
He's what,
in his late twenties?

14:29.107 --> 14:31.946
Heh heh. I'm not sure.

14:32.066 --> 14:33.267
Saved 'em!

14:33.427 --> 14:34.267
- That's great.
- Yzma: Great!

14:34.427 --> 14:35.427
- Good job.
- Very good job.

14:35.547 --> 14:37.427
Watch it.
They're still hot.

14:37.507 --> 14:39.147
Ahem.

14:39.267 --> 14:40.388
Ahem!

14:40.468 --> 14:41.388
Heh heh heh.

14:41.468 --> 14:43.108
Kronk.
The emperor

14:43.228 --> 14:45.387
needs his...
drink.

14:45.507 --> 14:48.788
Right. Oh. Right.

14:55.349 --> 14:58.388
Hey, Kronky,
everything ok back there?

14:58.508 --> 14:59.948
Well, heh.

15:00.068 --> 15:01.789
Oh, uh...

15:01.909 --> 15:04.389
Ooh. The drinks
were a bit on the...

15:04.469 --> 15:05.589
hmm...

15:05.709 --> 15:08.549
oh...ugh...warm side.

15:08.629 --> 15:09.830
Heh heh.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.949
Hey, did you see
that sky today?

15:12.069 --> 15:12.949
Talk about blue.

15:13.069 --> 15:14.429
Ha ha ha.
Yes, Kronk.

15:14.509 --> 15:16.230
Riveting.

15:16.350 --> 15:19.070
A toast to
the emperor!

15:19.190 --> 15:21.310
Long live Kuzco!

15:22.470 --> 15:23.791
Don't drink the wine.

15:23.911 --> 15:24.951
Poison.

15:30.871 --> 15:33.551
Ah! Tasty.

15:34.991 --> 15:36.831
Finally!
Ha ha ha!

15:36.951 --> 15:38.112
Good work,
Kronk.

15:38.232 --> 15:39.352
Oh, they're
so easy to make.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.351
I'll get you
the recipe.

15:40.471 --> 15:42.591
Now to get rid
of the body.

15:43.751 --> 15:45.672
Ok! What were we saying?

15:45.752 --> 15:49.112
Uh...we were
just making a toast

15:49.192 --> 15:50.312
Yzma:
to your long and

15:52.312 --> 15:53.953
healthy rule

15:54.073 --> 15:56.992
Right. So what
are you gonna do?

15:57.072 --> 15:59.432
I mean, you've been
around here a long time,

15:59.512 --> 16:02.433
and I really mean
a long time. Um...

16:02.513 --> 16:03.633
Ahem.

16:03.713 --> 16:04.913
It might
be difficult

16:04.993 --> 16:06.833
for someone of your age

16:06.953 --> 16:08.633
adjusting to life
in the private sector.

16:08.753 --> 16:10.673
Hey, Kronk, can you
top me off, pal?

16:10.753 --> 16:12.273
Be a friend? Heh heh.

16:13.673 --> 16:14.954
Now, about you
finding new work

16:15.034 --> 16:16.634
Hit him on the head.

16:16.714 --> 16:17.874
that's--that's
gonna be tough

16:17.994 --> 16:19.074
More broccoli?

16:19.194 --> 16:21.034
Because you're
you know

16:21.154 --> 16:22.914
Let's face it
You're no spring chicken,

16:23.034 --> 16:25.154
and I mean that
in the best possible way.

16:26.794 --> 16:29.395
What? A llama?

16:29.555 --> 16:31.515
He's supposed
to be dead!

16:31.635 --> 16:33.315
Yeah, weird.

16:34.395 --> 16:36.715
Let me see that vial.

16:39.155 --> 16:41.035
This isn't poison.

16:41.155 --> 16:45.356
This is extract
of llama. Ugh!

16:45.436 --> 16:46.516
You know,
in my defense,

16:46.636 --> 16:47.916
your poisons
all look alike.

16:48.036 --> 16:48.916
You might
think about

16:49.036 --> 16:50.196
re labeling
some of them.

16:50.316 --> 16:54.796
Take him out of town
and finish the job now!

16:54.876 --> 16:55.796
What about dinner?

16:55.876 --> 16:58.997
Kronk, this is
kind of important.

16:59.077 --> 17:00.837
How about dessert?

17:00.917 --> 17:04.597
Well, I suppose
there's time for dessert.

17:04.756 --> 17:06.196
And coffee?

17:06.277 --> 17:08.317
All right.
A quick cup of coffee.

17:08.396 --> 17:11.396
Then take him out of town
and finish the job!

17:16.478 --> 17:18.238
Cha cha
cha cha

17:18.318 --> 17:19.557
Guess where I am
right now

17:19.676 --> 17:21.718
Uh-huh. In the bag

17:21.838 --> 17:23.637
Still think I'm
not the victim here?

17:23.718 --> 17:25.478
Watch. It gets better.

17:25.598 --> 17:27.759
Hey! Ba-da ba-da
ba-da-da

17:27.839 --> 17:30.359
Ugh, he's doing
his own theme music?

17:37.679 --> 17:38.559
Ba-da
ba-da ba-da ba

17:38.679 --> 17:39.799
Ba-da-ba

17:39.959 --> 17:42.600
Gig, dumb,
and tone deaf

17:42.680 --> 17:45.320
I am so glad I was
unconscious for all of this

17:45.440 --> 17:46.320
Huhh!

17:49.119 --> 17:50.760
Mission accomplished.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.200
You're not
just gonna let him

18:03.360 --> 18:05.201
die like that,
are you?

18:05.361 --> 18:06.521
My shoulder angel.

18:06.601 --> 18:08.561
Don't
listen to that guy

18:08.641 --> 18:09.721
He's trying
to lead you

18:09.841 --> 18:11.522
down the path
of righteousness.

18:11.642 --> 18:14.482
I'm gonna lead you
down the path that rocks.

18:14.562 --> 18:15.601
Oh, come off it.

18:15.721 --> 18:16.761
You come off it!

18:16.881 --> 18:17.761
- You.
- You.

18:17.881 --> 18:19.122
- You.
- You infinity.

18:19.242 --> 18:20.122
Uhh!

18:21.242 --> 18:22.522
Listen up, big guy.

18:22.642 --> 18:25.002
I got 3 good reasons why
you should just walk away.

18:25.082 --> 18:26.003
" Number one..."

18:26.083 --> 18:27.043
Look at that guy!

18:27.123 --> 18:29.163
He's got that sissy
stringy music thing.

18:29.243 --> 18:30.362
We've been
through this.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.402
It's a harp,
and you know it.

18:32.482 --> 18:34.283
Oh, right.
That's a harp...

18:34.403 --> 18:35.323
and that's a dress.

18:35.403 --> 18:36.603
Robe!

18:36.723 --> 18:38.523
Reason number 2.

18:38.603 --> 18:39.843
Look what
I can do.

18:39.923 --> 18:41.004
Ha ha ha!

18:41.084 --> 18:43.124
But... what does that
have to do with anything?

18:43.244 --> 18:45.203
No, no.
He's got a point.

18:45.363 --> 18:46.723
Listen, you guys.

18:46.843 --> 18:49.604
You're sort of confusing me,
so be gone!

18:49.724 --> 18:51.204
Uh, or, uh, you know.

18:51.284 --> 18:52.804
However I get rid
of you guys.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.724
That'll work.

19:15.125 --> 19:17.606
Um, what's with
the chimp and the bug?

19:17.726 --> 19:19.646
Can we get back tome?

19:21.326 --> 19:23.926
Oh, boy.
Think, think, think.

19:24.047 --> 19:25.167
What to do, what to do?

19:25.287 --> 19:26.166
What do we do
with the body?

19:32.687 --> 19:34.447
What am I gonna
tell the village?

19:36.367 --> 19:38.127
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. ok.

19:38.247 --> 19:39.408
What do I
do? What do I do?

19:39.488 --> 19:40.487
- Aah!

19:45.527 --> 19:46.888
Back!
Elbow! Shoulder!

19:47.008 --> 19:48.448
- Unh!

19:54.968 --> 19:56.928
Oh. Hey! Hey, you!

19:57.008 --> 19:58.048
Hey!
Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:58.168 --> 20:00.649
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

20:00.729 --> 20:03.169
Comin' through.
Hey, you with the cart!

20:03.289 --> 20:05.209
Uh-oh

20:05.329 --> 20:06.449
This is not good.

20:06.529 --> 20:09.649
Uhh. Hope that doesn't
come back to haunt me.

21:01.973 --> 21:03.853
Mom, Mom!
I think I'm still growing!

21:04.013 --> 21:05.372
Measure me again!

21:05.492 --> 21:07.053
Ha!
All right, Tipo.

21:07.173 --> 21:08.333
Stand still
and let's see.

21:08.413 --> 21:09.933
Mom, you and I
both know

21:10.053 --> 21:11.253
that it's
impossible for him

21:11.373 --> 21:12.493
to have grown in
the last 5 minutes.

21:12.573 --> 21:14.094
Mmm! Mmm!

21:14.214 --> 21:15.494
Isn't it?

21:15.574 --> 21:16.574
Look how much
you've grown!

21:17.574 --> 21:19.493
What? Tipo, get
out of the way.

21:19.613 --> 21:21.374
It's my turn again.
Measure me.

21:21.494 --> 21:23.214
Dad's home!

21:24.654 --> 21:27.014
Hey, ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

21:27.094 --> 21:28.895
Come here
Ha ha ha!

21:31.775 --> 21:33.214
Dad! I ate
a bug today!

21:33.334 --> 21:34.854
Oh! Was Mom
baking again?

21:34.974 --> 21:36.415
Heh. Don't tell her
I said that.

21:36.535 --> 21:37.655
I heard that.

21:37.775 --> 21:39.695
Ok, everybody,
move aside

21:39.775 --> 21:42.295
Lady with a baby
comin' through.

21:42.375 --> 21:43.616
Dad, Dad, Dad!

21:43.736 --> 21:45.216
Look at
how big I am!

21:45.336 --> 21:46.416
We were all
measured today.

21:46.536 --> 21:47.415
Oh.

21:47.535 --> 21:49.015
I'm going through
a growth spurt.

21:49.135 --> 21:50.456
I'm as big
as you were

21:50.576 --> 21:51.456
when you were me.

21:51.576 --> 21:53.056
Mm-hmm. Sure are.

21:53.136 --> 21:55.936
That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

21:57.737 --> 21:59.137
Ok, ok, you two.

21:59.257 --> 22:00.737
Our deal was that
you could stay awake

22:00.817 --> 22:01.936
until Daddy came home.

22:02.056 --> 22:03.976
Now say good night.

22:04.096 --> 22:06.257
Dad,
do we have to?

22:10.297 --> 22:11.537
No, you two can stay up.

22:11.657 --> 22:14.098
We're just gonna be sittin'
here tellin' each other

22:14.218 --> 22:15.577
how much we love each other.

22:15.657 --> 22:16.657
Right, honey?

22:17.897 --> 22:18.817
- Ew!
- Blecch!

22:18.937 --> 22:19.818
Good night.

22:20.978 --> 22:23.338
So what did
the emperor want?

22:23.458 --> 22:24.338
Ahem.

22:24.458 --> 22:26.419
You know what?
He couldn't see me.

22:26.499 --> 22:27.499
Couldn't see you?

22:27.579 --> 22:28.979
- Why not?
- I don't know.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.378
Well, that's
just rude.

22:30.498 --> 22:31.778
Well, he is
the emperor.

22:31.898 --> 22:32.778
I'm sure he's busy.

22:32.898 --> 22:34.019
No, no, no, no. No.

22:34.139 --> 22:36.419
Emperor or no emperor,
it's called common courtesy.

22:36.499 --> 22:37.499
Honey...

22:37.619 --> 22:39.099
If that were me,
I'd march right back there

22:39.179 --> 22:40.899
and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

22:41.020 --> 22:42.420
Sweetie, sweetie,
think of the baby.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.019
Pacha, I'm fine.

22:44.139 --> 22:45.619
This baby's not coming
for a while,

22:45.739 --> 22:47.019
but even if it was,

22:47.139 --> 22:48.940
I'd give that guy
a piece of my mind.

22:49.020 --> 22:50.820
That kind of behavior
just--just--

22:50.940 --> 22:52.860
Uhh!

22:52.980 --> 22:54.460
I gotta go
wash something.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.142
Pacha?

23:11.222 --> 23:12.261
You ok?

23:12.381 --> 23:13.701
Hmm?

23:13.821 --> 23:16.061
Oh, yeah. I'm just
a little tired from the trip.

23:16.181 --> 23:19.902
Um...I知 gonna go
put Misty away.

23:31.782 --> 23:34.183
Uh, heh heh. Hi.
Excuse me.

23:34.263 --> 23:35.183
2 seconds here.

23:35.263 --> 23:37.223
Um, I'm the one
in the cart. Remember?

23:37.343 --> 23:39.903
This story's about me,
not him.

23:40.023 --> 23:42.223
ok. You got it?
All right.

23:42.303 --> 23:43.743
We're gonna move ahead.
Sorry to slow you down.

23:46.023 --> 23:47.384
Heh heh heh.

23:55.064 --> 23:56.224
Huh?

23:58.944 --> 23:59.864
Whoa.

23:59.944 --> 24:02.905
Uhh. Oh.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.265
Where'd you come from,
little guy?

24:04.385 --> 24:06.745
No touchy.

24:06.865 --> 24:08.104
Aah! Demon llama!

24:08.224 --> 24:09.705
Demon llama? Where?

24:09.825 --> 24:11.225
- Aah!
- Aah!

24:13.585 --> 24:15.946
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Ooh hoo hoo!

24:16.066 --> 24:18.826
Ow! Ow, my head.

24:18.946 --> 24:19.826
Ok, demon llama.

24:19.946 --> 24:21.786
Just take it easy.

24:21.906 --> 24:24.706
I mean you no harm.

24:24.786 --> 24:26.386
What are you
talking about--

24:26.506 --> 24:28.786
Oh, wait. I know you.

24:28.906 --> 24:30.146
You're that whiny
peasant.

24:31.307 --> 24:33.107
Emperor Kuzco?

24:33.227 --> 24:35.147
Yeah. Who do you think
you were talkin' to?

24:35.267 --> 24:37.426
Uh...how did--

24:37.506 --> 24:39.147
Um...

24:39.267 --> 24:40.587
you don't...

24:40.707 --> 24:42.667
look like
the emperor.

24:42.827 --> 24:44.467
What do you mean I don't
look like the emperor?

24:44.587 --> 24:45.948
Uh...oh...

24:46.028 --> 24:47.468
do this...

24:47.588 --> 24:49.348
What is this,
some kind of little game

24:49.468 --> 24:50.667
you country folk like to--

24:50.787 --> 24:52.628
Aah! It can't be! Aah!

24:54.148 --> 24:55.308
Aah! Aah!

24:55.468 --> 24:58.548
My face! Aah! My beautiful,
beautiful face!

24:58.668 --> 24:59.548
Ok, ok, ok.

24:59.669 --> 25:01.109
I'm an ugly,
stinky llama!

25:01.229 --> 25:02.549
Wait, ok,
Your Majesty.

25:02.669 --> 25:03.829
- Llama face!
- Shh!

25:03.949 --> 25:06.068
What happened?

25:06.188 --> 25:08.589
I'm tryin' to
figure that out, ok?

25:11.029 --> 25:12.109
Ohh-ho!

25:12.229 --> 25:13.469
I can't remember.

25:13.589 --> 25:15.110
I can't remember
anything.

25:15.230 --> 25:16.510
Wait a minute.

25:16.630 --> 25:18.310
I remember you.

25:18.390 --> 25:19.629
I remember
telling you

25:19.709 --> 25:20.869
that I was
building my pool

25:20.989 --> 25:21.950
where
your house was,

25:22.030 --> 25:23.670
and then you
got mad at me.

25:23.830 --> 25:25.390
Ohh!

25:25.510 --> 25:27.510
And you turned me
into a llama!

25:27.630 --> 25:29.871
What? No, I did not.

25:29.991 --> 25:31.271
Yes, and then
you kidnapped me.

25:31.351 --> 25:32.750
Why would I
kidnap a llama?

25:32.870 --> 25:34.110
I have no idea.

25:34.190 --> 25:36.071
You're the criminal
mastermind, not me.

25:36.191 --> 25:37.271
What?

25:37.351 --> 25:39.271
Hmm. You're right.

25:39.351 --> 25:41.391
That's giving you
way too much credit.

25:41.471 --> 25:43.752
ok. I have to get back
to the palace.

25:43.872 --> 25:46.672
Yzma's got
that "secret lab."

25:46.752 --> 25:48.551
I'll just
snap my fingers

25:48.671 --> 25:49.831
and order her
to change me back.

25:49.951 --> 25:52.032
Hey, you.
No time to waste.

25:52.192 --> 25:53.192
Let's go.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.593
Hey, tiny, I want
to get out of this body.

25:58.713 --> 26:00.113
Wouldn't you?
Now let's go.

26:02.752 --> 26:05.513
Build your summerhouse
somewhere else.

26:05.633 --> 26:07.953
You want to run that
by me again?

26:09.873 --> 26:11.473
I can't let you go back

26:11.553 --> 26:13.114
unless you change
your mind

26:13.234 --> 26:16.833
and build your summer
home somewhere else.

26:16.913 --> 26:19.073
Hmm. I got
a little secret for you.

26:19.193 --> 26:21.754
Come here.
No, closer.

26:21.874 --> 26:24.114
I don't make deals
with peasants!

26:24.234 --> 26:27.555
Then I guess I can't
take you back.

26:27.675 --> 26:29.274
Fine.
I don't need you.

26:29.394 --> 26:30.874
I can find
my own way back.

26:30.994 --> 26:32.154
I wouldn't recommend it.

26:32.274 --> 26:34.595
It's a little dangerous
if you don't know the way.

26:34.715 --> 26:35.715
Nice try, pal.

26:35.835 --> 26:37.155
No, really.
I'm telling you,

26:37.275 --> 26:38.995
There are
jaguars and snakes

26:39.115 --> 26:39.995
and quicksand

26:40.115 --> 26:40.995
I'm not listening.

26:41.115 --> 26:41.996
I'm not kidding.

26:42.116 --> 26:43.955
Listen, you cannot
go in there.

26:44.075 --> 26:44.955
La la la la

26:45.075 --> 26:48.355
Oh. Heh heh.
Still not listening.

26:48.435 --> 26:49.876
Aw, you...

26:49.956 --> 26:51.756
Fine. Fine.

26:51.876 --> 26:53.556
Go ahead!

26:53.716 --> 26:55.276
If there's no Kuzco,

26:55.396 --> 26:57.157
there's no Kuzcotopia.

26:57.277 --> 26:59.716
Takes care
of my problem.

27:05.997 --> 27:07.037
Hmm.

27:14.237 --> 27:15.877
Scary jungle.
Right.

27:15.997 --> 27:19.038
Ooh, a leaf.
Ooh, it might attack me.

27:19.158 --> 27:20.758
Oh, it's a scary tree.

27:20.838 --> 27:23.638
I'm afraid. Ha ha.

27:23.718 --> 27:26.198
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor,

27:26.278 --> 27:27.278
and as such,

27:27.358 --> 27:31.398
I'm born with an innate
sense of direction.

27:31.518 --> 27:32.959
Ok, where am I?

27:35.559 --> 27:37.879
Wha--

27:37.999 --> 27:39.878
Help me!
Help me!

27:39.958 --> 27:41.559
Help me!

27:43.439 --> 27:44.319
Uhh.

27:44.439 --> 27:45.999
Too late.

27:46.079 --> 27:48.760
Ok, that was the freakiest
thing I've ever seen.

27:54.239 --> 27:56.040
Aah!

27:56.160 --> 27:58.200
Hmm.
What do you want?

28:00.400 --> 28:01.800
Oh, for me?

28:01.880 --> 28:03.241
Why, I don't know
what to say.

28:05.201 --> 28:06.241
Ow!

28:06.361 --> 28:07.361
Hit the road, bucky.

28:11.041 --> 28:12.961
Aah! Ow!

28:13.081 --> 28:14.401
Huh?

28:14.521 --> 28:15.401
Huh?

28:17.562 --> 28:18.482
Huh?

28:19.602 --> 28:20.602
Uh-oh.

28:29.162 --> 28:30.722
No, no.
No, no, no, no.

28:31.843 --> 28:32.803
No, no.
No, don't.

28:38.803 --> 28:39.923
Ha!

28:41.443 --> 28:43.523
Aah!

28:45.243 --> 28:46.324
No!

28:53.164 --> 28:54.364
Aah!

28:56.884 --> 28:59.004
Aah!

29:04.684 --> 29:08.645
You killer jaguars...

29:08.765 --> 29:10.365
Whoa!

29:15.686 --> 29:18.006
Aah-eee!

29:18.166 --> 29:20.125
Aah!

29:26.526 --> 29:27.446
Aah!

29:29.927 --> 29:31.127
Yee-aah!

29:31.247 --> 29:33.446
Aah!

29:33.526 --> 29:35.406
Don't worry,
Your Highness. I gotcha.

29:35.486 --> 29:36.526
You're safe now.

29:40.367 --> 29:43.207
Maybe I'm just new to
this whole rescuing thing,

29:43.327 --> 29:44.688
but this, to me,

29:44.808 --> 29:46.608
might be considered
kind of a step backwards,

29:46.688 --> 29:47.607
wouldn't you say?

29:47.687 --> 29:49.127
No, no, no.
It's--It's ok.

29:49.207 --> 29:50.287
This--This is
all right.

29:50.447 --> 29:51.928
We can figure this out.

29:53.168 --> 29:55.568
I hate you.

29:55.688 --> 29:59.329
- No!
- Yaah!

30:00.649 --> 30:02.168
Aah! Ow!

30:08.529 --> 30:11.169
Whoo hoo hoo!

30:11.249 --> 30:12.849
Aah!

30:12.969 --> 30:14.250
Ow!

30:14.370 --> 30:15.569
Ow!

30:15.689 --> 30:16.649
Uhh!

30:22.050 --> 30:23.170
I don't know about you,

30:23.250 --> 30:24.730
but I'm getting
all funned out.

30:24.850 --> 30:26.010
Uh-oh.

30:26.130 --> 30:27.690
Don't tell me.

30:27.811 --> 30:29.370
We're about to go over
a huge waterfall.

30:29.530 --> 30:31.170
- Yep.
- Sharp rocks at the bottom?

30:31.290 --> 30:32.410
Most likely.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.010
Bring it on.

30:35.091 --> 30:36.851
Boo-yah!

30:36.971 --> 30:38.571
Whoo!

31:06.013 --> 31:07.933
Your Highness.

31:08.013 --> 31:10.573
Your Highness,
can you hear me?

31:10.653 --> 31:12.453
Oh, boy.
Come on, breathe.

31:14.053 --> 31:15.013
Breathe!

31:16.173 --> 31:18.453
Ohh. Why me?

31:25.773 --> 31:26.734
Ooh!

31:26.814 --> 31:27.734
All right.

31:31.214 --> 31:32.494
- Ohh!
- Aah!

31:36.095 --> 31:37.295
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

31:40.294 --> 31:41.295
For the last time,

31:41.415 --> 31:44.295
it was not a kiss.

31:44.415 --> 31:45.935
Well, whatever
you call it...

31:47.055 --> 31:48.936
it was disgusting.

31:49.016 --> 31:50.016
And if
you would've done

31:50.136 --> 31:51.616
what I ordered you to do
in the first place,

31:51.736 --> 31:52.856
we all could've
been spared

31:52.976 --> 31:56.296
your little
kiss of life.

31:56.416 --> 31:57.376
Aw!

31:57.496 --> 31:59.096
But now that
you're here,

31:59.176 --> 32:00.936
you will take me
back to the palace.

32:01.016 --> 32:02.016
I'll have Yzma
change me back,

32:02.136 --> 32:03.657
and then I'll start
construction

32:03.777 --> 32:05.217
on Kuzcotopia.

32:05.337 --> 32:06.217
Oh, yeah.

32:06.337 --> 32:08.256
Ok, now, look,

32:08.336 --> 32:10.737
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

32:10.817 --> 32:12.097
Mm-hmm.

32:12.177 --> 32:14.417
I just think if you really
thought about it,

32:14.497 --> 32:15.577
you'd decide
to build your home

32:15.657 --> 32:17.057
on a different hilltop.

32:17.177 --> 32:18.138
And why would I
do that?

32:19.418 --> 32:21.498
Because...

32:21.618 --> 32:23.097
deep down,
I think you'll realize

32:23.177 --> 32:24.738
that you're forcing
an entire village

32:24.858 --> 32:26.578
out of their homes
just for you.

32:26.698 --> 32:29.458
And that's...

32:29.578 --> 32:30.458
bad?

32:30.578 --> 32:33.019
Well, yeah.

32:33.099 --> 32:35.499
Nobody's
that heartless.

32:35.579 --> 32:36.538
Mmm.

32:37.818 --> 32:38.818
Now take me back.

32:38.938 --> 32:39.859
What?
Wait, wait.

32:39.939 --> 32:41.579
How can you
be this way?

32:41.699 --> 32:43.419
All you care about
is building your summer home

32:43.539 --> 32:45.259
and filling it
with stuff for you.

32:45.379 --> 32:46.860
Uh, yeah. Doh.
Me.

32:46.980 --> 32:49.180
Everyone else
in the kingdom gets it.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.419
You're the only one
that doesn't seem to be

32:50.539 --> 32:51.739
with the program,

32:51.859 --> 32:53.179
eh, Pacha?

32:53.259 --> 32:54.260
You know what?

32:54.380 --> 32:56.380
Someday, you're going
to wind up all alone,

32:56.500 --> 32:59.380
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.101
Thanks for that.
I'll log that away.

33:01.221 --> 33:02.581
Now, for the final time,

33:02.701 --> 33:05.540
I order you to take me
back to the palace.

33:05.660 --> 33:07.780
Looks to me like
you're stuck out here,

33:07.900 --> 33:09.061
because unless
you change your mind,

33:09.181 --> 33:11.581
I'm not taking you back.

33:13.741 --> 33:15.261
Because unless
you change your mind,

33:15.381 --> 33:16.742
I'm not
taking you back.

33:16.862 --> 33:20.101
Me, me, me.
Moo, moo, moo.

33:20.221 --> 33:21.701
Huh? What?

33:21.781 --> 33:23.542
I didn't do anything.
I didn't--

33:23.662 --> 33:24.782
Somebody's
throwing stuff.

33:24.902 --> 33:26.742
You going to build a fire
or what? What's going on?

33:28.942 --> 33:30.863
He's never going
to change his mind.

33:32.463 --> 33:35.902
Ohh. How am I ever going
to get out of here?

34:03.544 --> 34:04.824
And so,

34:04.904 --> 34:07.385
it is
with great sadness

34:07.465 --> 34:09.545
that we mourn
the sudden departure

34:09.665 --> 34:11.105
of our beloved prince...

34:12.625 --> 34:14.545
taken from us
so tragically

34:14.666 --> 34:17.505
on the very eve
of his 18th birthday.

34:17.585 --> 34:18.784
Poor little guy.

34:18.864 --> 34:21.145
His legacy will live on
in our hearts...

34:21.226 --> 34:22.426
He never had
a chance.

34:22.545 --> 34:25.306
for all eternity.

34:26.386 --> 34:28.667
Well, he ain't gettin'
any deader.

34:28.786 --> 34:29.786
Back to work.

34:43.627 --> 34:45.427
Kronk, darlin',

34:45.547 --> 34:47.706
I must admit
you had me worried

34:47.827 --> 34:49.867
when you mixed up
those poisons,

34:49.947 --> 34:52.547
but now that
Kuzco is dead,

34:52.628 --> 34:54.068
all is forgiven.

34:54.188 --> 34:55.828
Ah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's...

34:55.908 --> 34:58.188
Heh. He's dead,
all right. Heh heh.

34:58.268 --> 35:00.468
I mean, you can't get
much deader than he--

35:00.588 --> 35:02.068
than he is right now.

35:02.188 --> 35:04.388
Unless, of course,
we killed him again.

35:04.508 --> 35:07.349
I suppose.

35:07.429 --> 35:09.749
Hey, look,
the royal dresser's here.

35:09.829 --> 35:11.109
Kronk...

35:12.509 --> 35:14.029
I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.

35:14.109 --> 35:15.029
Kronk...

35:15.109 --> 35:18.229
I wear a 66 long
and a 31 waist.

35:18.309 --> 35:21.230
Kuzco is dead, right?

35:21.310 --> 35:22.790
Tell me Kuzco's dead.

35:22.870 --> 35:26.069
I need to hear
these words.

35:26.149 --> 35:28.830
Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?

35:28.950 --> 35:30.390
He's still alive?

35:30.470 --> 35:32.830
Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

35:32.950 --> 35:34.311
Kronk...

35:34.391 --> 35:36.351
I just thought
I'd give you the heads-up

35:36.471 --> 35:37.911
in case Kuzco
ever came back.

35:38.071 --> 35:39.910
He can't come back!

35:40.030 --> 35:41.911
Yeah. That would be
kind of awkward--

35:42.031 --> 35:43.831
especially after
that lovely eulogy.

35:43.991 --> 35:45.471
You think?

35:45.591 --> 35:47.511
You and I are going out
to find him.

35:47.631 --> 35:49.352
If he talks,
we are through!

35:49.472 --> 35:50.552
Now let's move!

35:51.352 --> 35:52.592
Dad, look out!

35:53.871 --> 35:55.551
Tipo, what is it?

35:55.711 --> 35:57.672
I had a dream that
Dad was tied to a log

35:57.752 --> 35:59.352
and was careening
out of control

35:59.472 --> 36:01.552
down a raging river
of death!

36:01.672 --> 36:02.912
All right, all right,
it's ok.

36:03.032 --> 36:04.113
- It was awful!
- Shh!

36:04.193 --> 36:05.793
It's ok, it's ok.
Tipo, calm down.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.433
It was just a dream.

36:07.553 --> 36:08.672
Your dad's fine.

36:08.752 --> 36:10.472
He just went back
to see the emperor.

36:12.193 --> 36:14.313
Oh. Like you
told him to,

36:14.393 --> 36:15.753
'cause you're
always right.

36:15.873 --> 36:17.153
That's right.

36:17.233 --> 36:18.954
Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.

36:19.034 --> 36:20.914
Yeah, like that
would ever happen.

36:21.074 --> 36:22.673
- It could.
- Nuh-uh.

36:22.793 --> 36:24.033
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

36:24.113 --> 36:25.394
Yeah-huh.

36:27.954 --> 36:28.874
Good night, you two.

36:28.954 --> 36:29.954
- Night, Mom!
- Night, Mom!

36:30.074 --> 36:31.834
- Yeah-huh. Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh.

36:37.754 --> 36:40.115
Ooh!

36:41.995 --> 36:42.955
B-B-Brr!

36:43.035 --> 36:44.915
Uh, hey

36:49.796 --> 36:50.835
Thanks.

36:50.955 --> 36:52.915
Oh.

36:53.035 --> 36:54.476
No problem.

36:56.156 --> 36:57.476
Feels like wool.

36:57.556 --> 36:58.756
Yeah.

36:58.836 --> 37:00.116
Alpaca?

37:00.196 --> 37:01.596
Oh, yeah, it is.

37:01.677 --> 37:04.276
Oh, yeah,
I thought so.

37:04.356 --> 37:05.636
It's nice.

37:05.756 --> 37:07.236
My wife made it.

37:07.356 --> 37:08.596
Oh, she knits?

37:08.676 --> 37:10.317
Crochets.

37:10.437 --> 37:12.557
Crochets?
Nice.

37:12.677 --> 37:14.397
Thanks.

37:19.797 --> 37:21.597
So...

37:21.717 --> 37:26.118
So, I was thinking that
when I got back to the city,

37:26.238 --> 37:27.478
we'd, uh...

37:27.558 --> 37:28.678
I mean, there's
lots of hilltops,

37:28.758 --> 37:31.359
and maybe I might,
you know...

37:31.479 --> 37:32.638
I--I might...

37:32.718 --> 37:35.638
Are you saying...

37:35.718 --> 37:37.238
you've changed
your mind?

37:37.358 --> 37:39.079
Oh, well, l--I...

37:39.239 --> 37:40.559
Because you know
that means

37:40.679 --> 37:43.519
you're doing something
nice for someone else.

37:43.599 --> 37:45.399
No, I know that.
I know.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.399
And you're all right
with that?

37:47.519 --> 37:48.399
Yes.

37:54.840 --> 37:55.840
What?

37:58.920 --> 38:01.120
Don't shake
unless you mean it.

38:09.041 --> 38:10.441
All right.

38:12.081 --> 38:14.602
Let's get you
back to the palace.

38:14.682 --> 38:17.201
Oh, by the way,
thanks.

38:17.361 --> 38:19.241
No...

38:19.321 --> 38:20.961
thank you

38:33.642 --> 38:35.322
ok.
Once we cross this bridge,

38:35.402 --> 38:36.803
it's only an hour
to the palace.

38:36.883 --> 38:38.243
Good, because
believe it or not,

38:38.363 --> 38:39.483
I think I need a bath.

38:39.563 --> 38:40.483
I believe it.

38:40.563 --> 38:41.923
- What was that?
- Nothing.

38:42.043 --> 38:43.562
Ohh!

38:43.722 --> 38:45.083
Whoa!

38:45.203 --> 38:46.243
Kuzco!

38:47.883 --> 38:49.323
Kuzco!

38:49.403 --> 38:50.883
- Yeah?
- Quick, help me up!

38:53.004 --> 38:54.764
No. I don't think
I will.

38:54.884 --> 38:56.204
You're going
to leave me here?

38:56.324 --> 38:58.444
Well, I was going to have
you imprisoned for life,

38:58.564 --> 39:00.084
but I kind of
like this better.

39:00.244 --> 39:02.324
I thought you were
a changed man.

39:02.404 --> 39:03.404
Oh, come on.
I had to say something

39:03.524 --> 39:05.164
to get you to take me
back to the city.

39:05.244 --> 39:07.085
So all of it
was a lie?

39:07.165 --> 39:09.205
Well, yeah.
No, wait.

39:11.364 --> 39:13.525
Uh, yeah, yeah.
It all was a lie.

39:13.645 --> 39:15.285
Toodles.

39:15.405 --> 39:16.845
We shook hands on it!

39:20.806 --> 39:23.526
You know, the funny thing
about shaking hands is...

39:23.606 --> 39:25.206
you need hands.

39:25.285 --> 39:26.765
Ha! ok.

39:26.885 --> 39:28.486
Buh-bye.

39:28.606 --> 39:29.846
Aah!

39:29.926 --> 39:31.486
Are you ok?
Are you all right?

39:31.606 --> 39:33.006
Yeah.

39:33.086 --> 39:34.046
Yeah. I think
I'm all right.

39:34.126 --> 39:35.887
Good!

39:36.007 --> 39:37.767
That's for going back
on your promise!

39:37.887 --> 39:39.047
Yii!

39:39.167 --> 39:41.166
Yeah. That's for
kidnapping me

39:41.286 --> 39:42.567
and taking me
to your village...

39:42.647 --> 39:44.447
which I'm still gonna
destroy, by the way.

39:44.567 --> 39:46.487
Ah ha ha ha!
No touchy.

39:46.607 --> 39:47.487
Ooh!

39:47.607 --> 39:48.767
Why did I risk my life

39:48.887 --> 39:50.488
for a selfish brat
like you?

39:50.608 --> 39:52.528
I was always taught that there
was some good in everyone,

39:52.608 --> 39:54.247
but, ooh,
you proved me wrong.

39:54.327 --> 39:56.407
Oh, boohoo.
Now I feel really bad.

39:56.487 --> 39:57.568
Bad llama.

39:57.648 --> 39:59.128
I could've let you die
out there in that jungle,

39:59.248 --> 40:00.888
and then all my problems
would be over.

40:00.968 --> 40:03.248
Well, that makes you
ugly and stupid.

40:03.328 --> 40:04.489
Let's end this.

40:04.609 --> 40:05.729
Ladies first.

40:05.809 --> 40:08.888
- Aah! - Yaah!

40:16.289 --> 40:17.169
Ohh!

40:21.809 --> 40:23.449
- Aah!
- Aah!

40:24.969 --> 40:26.330
- Ow! Ow!
- Ow! Ow!

40:26.410 --> 40:29.370
- Whoa!
- Ohh!

40:32.410 --> 40:33.411
What are we
gonna do?

40:34.211 --> 40:35.611
Aah!

40:35.691 --> 40:37.290
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!

40:37.410 --> 40:40.771
We're gonna die!
That's it for me!

40:40.891 --> 40:41.811
No, we're not

40:41.891 --> 40:43.571
Calm down.

40:43.651 --> 40:46.611
I have an idea.
Give me your arm.

40:46.731 --> 40:49.132
Ok, now
the other one.

40:50.491 --> 40:53.291
When I say go,
push against my back,

40:53.371 --> 40:55.332
and we'll walk
up the hill.

40:55.412 --> 40:56.492
Ready?

40:56.612 --> 40:57.532
Go.

40:57.612 --> 40:58.532
Ow!

40:58.612 --> 41:00.892
You did that
on purpose.

41:01.012 --> 41:03.213
- Aah!
- No, I didn't!

41:03.373 --> 41:04.532
Now, we're gonna have
to work together

41:04.652 --> 41:06.612
to get out of this,
so follow my lead.

41:06.692 --> 41:07.972
Ready?

41:08.052 --> 41:09.172
- Right foot.
- Whose right?

41:09.292 --> 41:10.733
Your right
or mine?

41:10.853 --> 41:11.933
I don't care.
Mine.

41:12.013 --> 41:13.173
Well, why yours?

41:13.253 --> 41:14.373
Ok, your right!
Ready?

41:14.493 --> 41:15.373
Ok, got it.

41:15.493 --> 41:17.214
Ok, right.

41:17.334 --> 41:18.973
Left. Right.

41:19.053 --> 41:21.533
Ha ha!
Look, we're moving!

41:22.613 --> 41:23.533
Aah!

41:23.613 --> 41:25.294
Don't look down!
Now, stay with me.

41:25.374 --> 41:26.294
Stay with me.

41:26.374 --> 41:28.094
Right. Left.

41:28.214 --> 41:29.934
Right. Left.

41:30.054 --> 41:32.215
Right. Left.

41:32.334 --> 41:33.974
Right!

41:34.054 --> 41:36.694
Now what, genius?

41:36.774 --> 41:38.574
Working on it.

41:38.694 --> 41:40.855
Ok, here's the deal.

41:40.935 --> 41:42.415
Stretch out your neck,

41:42.535 --> 41:44.095
and I'll grab the rope.

41:44.215 --> 41:45.655
How do I know
you won't let me fall

41:45.735 --> 41:46.855
after you grab
the rope?

41:46.935 --> 41:49.935
You're just gonna
have to trust me!

41:52.735 --> 41:54.456
You know,
it's a good thing

41:54.576 --> 41:55.896
you're not
a big, fat guy,

41:56.056 --> 41:57.896
or this would be
really difficult.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.936
Aah! Aah!

42:00.056 --> 42:01.376
Almost.

42:01.456 --> 42:02.776
Got it!

42:03.936 --> 42:05.016
It's stuck.

42:05.096 --> 42:08.097
Take your time.
No hurry here.

42:09.417 --> 42:10.937
Scorpions!
Aah ha ha!

42:11.057 --> 42:11.977
Kuzco!

42:12.097 --> 42:13.297
Aah!

42:13.417 --> 42:15.016
Oh, no!

42:18.177 --> 42:19.097
Uhh!

42:19.177 --> 42:21.537
Aah!

42:21.617 --> 42:23.738
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

42:23.858 --> 42:25.258
Huh?

42:26.498 --> 42:28.937
Aah!

42:29.017 --> 42:30.578
Aah!

42:30.658 --> 42:33.938
Whoa!

42:41.979 --> 42:44.258
- Huh?

42:44.378 --> 42:46.259
Look out!

42:46.339 --> 42:47.699
Ohh!

42:47.819 --> 42:50.099
Pacha: Ohh

42:50.179 --> 42:51.900
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

42:51.980 --> 42:53.380
Ooh, look at me
and my bad self.

42:53.460 --> 42:56.220
I snatched you
right out of the air.

42:56.300 --> 42:58.179
"Ooh, I'm
a crumbly canyon wall,

42:58.299 --> 42:59.900
and I'm taking you
with me."

42:59.980 --> 43:00.940
Well, not today, pal.

43:01.020 --> 43:02.100
Uh-huh.

43:02.180 --> 43:03.740
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

43:03.820 --> 43:04.740
Uh-huh

43:04.820 --> 43:06.861
You just saved my life.

43:06.981 --> 43:07.901
Huh?

43:09.341 --> 43:10.301
So?

43:10.381 --> 43:11.580
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

43:11.660 --> 43:12.940
That there is some good
in you after all.

43:13.020 --> 43:13.941
Oh, no
- Admit it.

43:14.021 --> 43:15.301
- Wrong.
- Yes, there is.

43:15.421 --> 43:16.741
- Nuh-uh.
- I think there is.

43:16.821 --> 43:18.461
- Hey, you could've let me fall.
- Nuh-uh!

43:18.581 --> 43:19.621
Come on,
what's the big deal?

43:19.701 --> 43:21.422
Nobody's that heartless.

43:23.222 --> 43:25.142
Don't read
too much into it.

43:25.221 --> 43:26.741
It was a one-time thing.

43:26.861 --> 43:29.302
Right. Sure.

43:29.382 --> 43:31.342
Well, we better get going.

43:31.462 --> 43:32.582
With that bridge out,

43:32.662 --> 43:33.982
it's a 4-daywalk
to the palace.

43:34.062 --> 43:35.823
What?

43:35.943 --> 43:37.303
You mean you're still
taking me back?

43:37.383 --> 43:38.863
I shook on it,
didn't I?

43:38.943 --> 43:41.142
Well, yeah,
but I hope you realize

43:41.262 --> 43:42.502
that doesn't
change a thing.

43:42.582 --> 43:44.463
I'm still building
Kuzcotopia

43:44.543 --> 43:45.503
when I get back.

43:45.583 --> 43:47.143
Well, 4 days
is a long time.

43:47.223 --> 43:48.823
Who knows? Maybe
you'll change your mind.

43:48.943 --> 43:49.863
Uh-huh.

43:49.943 --> 43:51.624
4 days.

43:51.704 --> 43:53.503
What are the chances
of you carrying me?

43:53.623 --> 43:55.023
Not good.

43:57.303 --> 43:59.464
No, no, no!

43:59.584 --> 44:00.744
We've searched
every village

44:00.864 --> 44:02.104
surrounding the palace

44:02.184 --> 44:03.984
and still
no sign of Kuzco.

44:04.104 --> 44:06.225
Where is he?

44:06.305 --> 44:07.225
Kronk!

44:07.305 --> 44:08.384
Kronk here.

44:08.464 --> 44:10.304
I'm getting tired.
Pull over.

44:10.424 --> 44:11.704
Sure thing.
Kronk out.

44:16.665 --> 44:18.545
Ooh! Aah!

44:18.665 --> 44:19.786
Aah! Ohh!

44:23.745 --> 44:24.905
Perfect.

44:24.985 --> 44:27.786
These are my best shoes.

44:29.506 --> 44:32.186
I hate this jungle.

44:33.346 --> 44:34.987
Oh, look.

44:35.107 --> 44:37.106
A golden-throated
small-winged warbler.

44:37.266 --> 44:39.186
Just one more
for exotic bird bingo.

44:39.266 --> 44:40.186
Aah!

44:40.266 --> 44:41.907
I am loving this.

44:50.387 --> 44:52.107
Get away from me!

44:52.187 --> 44:53.667
Uhh

44:55.788 --> 44:56.868
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

44:58.748 --> 45:00.108
No, no,
it's not you.

45:00.188 --> 45:02.428
She's not the easiest
person to get close to.

45:02.508 --> 45:04.908
There's a wall there.
Trust me.

45:05.028 --> 45:07.028
Are you talking
to that squirrel?

45:07.148 --> 45:09.188
I was a junior chipmunk.

45:09.308 --> 45:11.829
I had to be versed in
all the woodland creatures.

45:11.949 --> 45:12.949
Please continue.

45:15.509 --> 45:16.669
Aah!

45:16.749 --> 45:18.309
Why me?

45:18.389 --> 45:19.589
Why me?

45:19.709 --> 45:21.909
Hey, it doesn't always
have to be about you.

45:22.029 --> 45:23.869
This poor little guy
has had it rough.

45:23.989 --> 45:25.190
Seems a talking llama

45:25.310 --> 45:27.150
Kronk: gave him a hard
time the other day

45:27.230 --> 45:29.710
Oh, a talking llama?

45:29.830 --> 45:31.510
Ha ha ha ha!
Do tell.

45:31.630 --> 45:32.670
Heh heh heh heh!

45:34.510 --> 45:36.910
Uh, he doesn't really
want to talk to you.

45:36.990 --> 45:39.070
Well, then
you ask him.

45:40.231 --> 45:41.351
I hate being
in the middle.

45:41.471 --> 45:42.711
Squeaky, uh...

45:42.791 --> 45:44.631
squeak, squeaker,
squeakin'.

45:46.071 --> 45:47.391
Aah!

45:47.551 --> 45:49.591
Jaguars? No kidding?
Brutal.

45:56.632 --> 45:58.512
Uh, could you give us
a little room here?

45:58.592 --> 45:59.832
Uh, sorry.

46:01.832 --> 46:03.032
Uh-uh.

46:03.192 --> 46:05.592
A little bit more,
please.

46:05.672 --> 46:07.632
How is this?

46:07.752 --> 46:08.793
- Yeah, that's good.

46:08.913 --> 46:12.553
Now ask him which way
the talking llama went!

46:12.673 --> 46:16.193
Uh, squeakity-squeak,
squeakin'.

46:27.754 --> 46:28.873
Low blood sugar, huh?

46:28.953 --> 46:30.794
Yeah.
It's a curse. Ha.

46:30.914 --> 46:32.194
Well, as soon as we get
something to eat,

46:32.274 --> 46:33.914
you're walking
the rest of the way.

46:45.235 --> 46:47.635
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut,

46:47.715 --> 46:49.435
home of the mug...

46:51.395 --> 46:54.076
...of meat.
What'll it be?

46:54.196 --> 46:56.676
Ahem. We'll have
2 specials.

46:56.836 --> 46:58.475
Is that all right,
dear?

46:58.555 --> 47:01.076
Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.

47:01.196 --> 47:03.476
Hee hee hee. We're
on our honeymoon.

47:03.556 --> 47:06.756
Bless you for
coming out in public.

47:06.876 --> 47:08.917
So that's 2 specials.

47:09.037 --> 47:12.236
And an onion log.
To split.

47:13.756 --> 47:15.997
Ordering!
I need 2 heartburns

47:16.077 --> 47:19.317
and a deep-fried doorstop
on table 1 2!

47:21.838 --> 47:23.998
Ok, so I'll admit
this was a good idea.

47:24.078 --> 47:27.197
When will you learn that
all my ideas are good ones?

47:27.277 --> 47:28.677
That's funny,

47:28.757 --> 47:30.718
because I thought you going
into the jungle by yourself,

47:30.798 --> 47:32.238
being chased by jaguars,

47:32.318 --> 47:33.838
lying to me to take you
back to the palace

47:33.958 --> 47:35.758
were all really bad ideas.

47:35.918 --> 47:38.479
Anything sounds bad when
you say it with that attitude.

47:38.599 --> 47:43.719
Hot and crispy pill bug
for the happy couple.

47:43.799 --> 47:44.719
Mazeltov

47:47.959 --> 47:50.439
Oh, boy.

47:51.960 --> 47:55.919
Ooh. Ugh. Bluh.

47:55.999 --> 47:57.159
Urp!

47:57.279 --> 47:59.640
Oh, here
Let me get that for you

47:59.760 --> 48:02.160
Bleaggh! Uck!

48:03.400 --> 48:04.320
Where are you going?

48:04.440 --> 48:05.801
I'm just going to slip
into the kitchen

48:05.921 --> 48:06.881
and have a word
with the chef.

48:06.961 --> 48:08.560
You're gonna get us
thrown out.

48:08.640 --> 48:11.120
Please.
With this disguise,

48:11.200 --> 48:13.161
I'm invisible.

48:17.481 --> 48:18.361
Heh heh!

48:18.481 --> 48:20.362
We've been walking
around in circles

48:20.482 --> 48:21.841
for who knows how long.

48:21.921 --> 48:23.841
That is the last time

48:23.921 --> 48:25.761
we take directions
from a squirrel.

48:25.841 --> 48:27.762
I should have done away
with Kuzco myself

48:27.842 --> 48:29.162
when I had the chance.

48:31.682 --> 48:34.643
Oh, you really gotta stop
beating yourself up about that.

48:37.162 --> 48:39.762
Uh-oh I'll get you
another one there, Yzma

48:40.842 --> 48:42.683
You using
that fork there, pal?

48:42.803 --> 48:43.803
Hey, don't I know you?

48:43.923 --> 48:44.843
I don't think so.

48:44.923 --> 48:46.363
Wrestled you
in high school?

48:46.443 --> 48:47.763
Don't remember that.

48:47.843 --> 48:48.883
Metal shop? I got it!

48:49.003 --> 48:50.923
Miss Narca's interpretive
dance--2 semesters.

48:51.003 --> 48:53.803
I was usually in the back
because of my weak ankles.

48:53.883 --> 48:55.643
Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.

48:55.763 --> 48:57.444
I don't think
we've ever met,

48:57.524 --> 48:58.684
but I gotta go.

48:58.804 --> 48:59.884
Don't worry.
I'll think of it.

49:00.004 --> 49:02.644
Look, all I know is
the food looked iffy.

49:02.764 --> 49:04.684
I'm not the only one
that thinks that, I'm sure.

49:04.804 --> 49:05.684
Psst! Hey!

49:05.804 --> 49:07.724
So I'm just
checking to make sure

49:07.804 --> 49:09.484
you're going to take
the main course up a notch.

49:09.564 --> 49:12.005
Is there anything
on this menu

49:12.085 --> 49:13.325
that is not
swimming in gravy?

49:13.445 --> 49:14.765
Hang on.
I'll go ask the chef.

49:14.885 --> 49:16.685
It's a simple
question.

49:16.765 --> 49:18.725
Is there or is there
not anything edible...

49:18.845 --> 49:20.085
- on this menu?
- Gah!

49:22.485 --> 49:25.125
Hey, I didn't ask him
about dessert yet!

49:25.205 --> 49:27.606
Hey, pal, what's your policy
on making special orders?

49:27.726 --> 49:29.886
All right, buster,
that's it!

49:30.006 --> 49:31.366
You want a special order,
then you make it!

49:31.446 --> 49:32.405
I quit!

49:32.485 --> 49:33.886
Yeah, but l--

49:33.966 --> 49:35.566
I try and I try,
but there's no respect

49:35.686 --> 49:37.086
for anyone with vision.
That's it!

49:37.206 --> 49:38.686
There's just nothing
I can do about it!

49:38.806 --> 49:39.726
Please don't go.

49:39.846 --> 49:42.207
3 pork combos,
extra bacon on the side,

49:42.287 --> 49:43.967
2 chili cheese
samplers,

49:44.087 --> 49:45.687
a basket of
liver and onion rings,

49:45.807 --> 49:47.206
a catch of the day,

49:47.286 --> 49:49.407
and a steak cut
in the shape of a trout.

49:49.527 --> 49:50.727
You got all that, honey?

49:50.847 --> 49:52.527
3 oinkers wearing pants,
plate of hot air,

49:52.687 --> 49:54.087
basket of
grandma's breakfast,

49:54.167 --> 49:55.288
and change the bull
to a gill, got it.

49:55.408 --> 49:56.408
What's going on?

49:56.568 --> 49:58.008
No time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.

49:58.088 --> 50:01.567
What is he
doing in there?

50:04.448 --> 50:05.568
Unh! Come on!

50:05.688 --> 50:07.408
In a minute.
I'm still hungry.

50:07.488 --> 50:08.688
No, Kuzco!

50:08.768 --> 50:10.369
Ok, I'll make it simple
for you.

50:10.449 --> 50:12.209
I'll have a spinach omelet
with wheat toast.

50:12.289 --> 50:13.689
- You got it?
- Can do.

50:13.769 --> 50:16.248
What's taking so long?

50:16.328 --> 50:17.289
Pickup!

50:17.369 --> 50:18.889
Kronk!
What are you doing?

50:19.049 --> 50:20.009
Kinda busy here.

50:20.129 --> 50:21.169
Why am I
not surprised?

50:21.289 --> 50:22.289
Your order's up!

50:22.409 --> 50:23.970
Ohh!

50:24.090 --> 50:26.450
Oh, well,
while you're at it,

50:26.570 --> 50:28.450
make me the special.
And hold the gravy!

50:28.569 --> 50:29.489
Check. Pickup!

50:29.609 --> 50:31.009
You know what?
On second thought,

50:31.129 --> 50:32.170
make my omelet
a meat pie.

50:32.290 --> 50:33.210
Meat pie Check

50:33.290 --> 50:34.210
Kronk!

50:35.450 --> 50:37.730
Can I order the potatoes
as a side dish?

50:37.810 --> 50:38.811
I'll have to charge you
full price.

50:38.931 --> 50:39.931
Ooh!

50:40.011 --> 50:41.771
Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?

50:41.851 --> 50:43.090
You got it. Want cheese
on those potatoes?

50:43.170 --> 50:44.650
Thank you, Kronk.
Cheddar will be fine.

50:44.770 --> 50:45.931
Cheddar spuds
coming up.

50:46.011 --> 50:46.931
Spuds yes,
cheese no.

50:47.011 --> 50:47.971
Hold the cheese.

50:48.091 --> 50:48.971
No, I want
the cheese

50:49.091 --> 50:50.251
Cheese me
no like.

50:50.331 --> 50:51.411
- Cheese out.
- Cheese in!

50:51.491 --> 50:52.411
Come on,
make up your mind!

50:52.491 --> 50:53.652
Ok, ok,
on second thought...

50:53.772 --> 50:55.252
Make
my potatoes a salad.

51:12.492 --> 51:13.732
Excuse me. You see
that woman over there?

51:15.693 --> 51:17.973
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.

51:23.334 --> 51:24.334
Waiters: 1, 2, 3, 4

51:24.494 --> 51:25.333
Happy, happy birthday

51:25.493 --> 51:26.893
From all of us to you

51:27.013 --> 51:27.893
We wish
it was our birthday

51:28.013 --> 51:29.373
So we could party, too

51:29.493 --> 51:30.814
Happy, happy birthday

51:30.894 --> 51:31.894
May all your dreams
come true

51:32.014 --> 51:34.974
Ha ha ha!
It's your birthday?

51:37.015 --> 51:38.255
What are you doing?

51:38.375 --> 51:40.334
Look, there's 2 people
in there looking for you.

51:40.454 --> 51:41.374
What?

51:41.454 --> 51:42.574
A big guy
and a skinny old woman.

51:42.694 --> 51:44.815
Wait. Was this woman
scary beyond all reason?

51:44.975 --> 51:45.855
Oh, yeah.

51:46.015 --> 51:47.655
That's Yzma and Kronk!
I'm saved!

51:47.775 --> 51:49.895
Trust me, they're
not here to save you.

51:50.015 --> 51:51.175
They'll take me back
to the palace.

51:51.295 --> 51:52.936
Thanks for your help.
You've been great.

51:53.056 --> 51:54.175
I can take it from here.

51:54.255 --> 51:56.735
You don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.

51:56.855 --> 51:58.615
Kill me? Their whole world
revolves around me.

51:58.735 --> 51:59.976
No. I can't let you!

52:00.056 --> 52:02.056
What? Wha--

52:02.136 --> 52:03.896
Oh, I get it!

52:04.016 --> 52:05.016
What?

52:05.136 --> 52:06.577
You don't want to take me
back to the palace.

52:06.697 --> 52:08.536
You want to keep me
stranded out here forever.

52:08.616 --> 52:09.736
No!

52:09.856 --> 52:11.336
This has all been an act,
and I almost fell for it.

52:11.416 --> 52:12.536
Will you just
listen to me--

52:12.616 --> 52:13.857
No, no,
you listen to me.

52:13.937 --> 52:16.937
All you care about
is your stupid hilltop!

52:17.057 --> 52:18.217
What?

52:18.297 --> 52:19.817
You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here.

52:19.897 --> 52:20.818
- Go!
- But--

52:20.898 --> 52:23.017
Go on! Get outta here!

52:23.097 --> 52:25.497
Fine! Hmph!

52:25.577 --> 52:27.657
Oh, this entire mess
is all your fault.

52:27.737 --> 52:29.138
What'd I do?

52:29.258 --> 52:31.258
If you hadn't mixed up
those poisons,

52:31.378 --> 52:32.898
Kuzco would be dead now!

52:33.018 --> 52:34.938
There'll be
no more diversions

52:35.018 --> 52:37.578
until we track that
llama down and kill him!

52:37.738 --> 52:39.698
Said I was sorry.
Can't just let it go.

52:39.778 --> 52:41.898
Not even
on your birthday.

52:42.018 --> 52:44.299
Kuzco must be eliminated

52:44.419 --> 52:47.259
The empire will finally be
rid of that useless slug

52:47.379 --> 52:49.259
You got a point

52:49.419 --> 52:52.259
Nobody really seems to care
that he's gone, do they?

52:53.859 --> 52:55.579
Pacha!

53:00.620 --> 53:02.140
Pacha?

53:39.662 --> 53:42.063
So this is where you came in

53:42.183 --> 53:44.703
See, just like I said,
I'm the victim here

53:44.823 --> 53:46.702
I didn't do anything,
and they ruined my life

53:46.822 --> 53:47.782
and took everything I had

53:47.902 --> 53:49.823
Hey, give it a rest
up there, will you?

53:49.943 --> 53:52.223
What? I知 just telling
them what happened

53:52.343 --> 53:53.783
Who you kidding, pal?

53:53.943 --> 53:56.024
They saw the whole thing,
they know what happened.

53:56.144 --> 53:58.144
Well, yeah, but

53:58.264 --> 53:59.944
Just leave me alone.

54:27.306 --> 54:30.905
The peasant at the diner!

54:31.025 --> 54:33.586
He didn't pay his check.

54:45.306 --> 54:47.267
He's the peasant
who I saw leaving the city

54:47.387 --> 54:48.947
who disappeared
into the crowd

54:49.067 --> 54:50.587
with Kuzco
on the back of his cart.

54:50.667 --> 54:52.467
He must have taken him
back to his village,

54:52.547 --> 54:54.268
so if we find the village,
we find him,

54:54.348 --> 54:56.068
and if we find him,
we find Kuzco.

54:56.148 --> 54:59.147
Oh, yeah,
it's all comin' together.

54:59.507 --> 55:01.268
Yzma!

55:01.388 --> 55:02.508
What?!

55:02.588 --> 55:03.628
Aah!

55:03.748 --> 55:07.148
This had
better be good!

56:09.352 --> 56:10.512
Yeech.

56:12.232 --> 56:14.433
So, there we were
standing on the cliff,

56:14.593 --> 56:16.833
and the ground
started to rumble

56:16.913 --> 56:18.913
And just as
it started to go,

56:19.033 --> 56:20.673
he grabbed me
before I fell

56:20.753 --> 56:22.393
Do you believe that?

56:22.473 --> 56:23.873
You know, call me crazy

56:23.953 --> 56:25.873
for following this guy
all the way out here,

56:25.953 --> 56:27.673
but as much
as he tries to deny it,

56:27.753 --> 56:29.274
I know
there's some good in him

56:29.394 --> 56:32.234
Besides, I couldn't just
leave him out here all alone.

56:32.314 --> 56:35.034
He's a lousy llama.

56:35.114 --> 56:39.474
I mean,
a really lousy llama.

56:50.755 --> 56:52.235
Hey, listen, Pacha,

56:52.355 --> 56:55.315
you know, what I said to you
back at the diner,

56:55.435 --> 56:58.436
that--that--
I--I didn't really...

56:58.516 --> 57:01.356
So...you tired of
being a llama?

57:02.476 --> 57:05.075
Ye-ee-ee-es!

57:06.276 --> 57:08.116
Ok, we're just gonna
stop at the house

57:08.276 --> 57:09.316
and get some supplies.

57:09.436 --> 57:10.916
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.

57:10.996 --> 57:14.077
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.

57:14.157 --> 57:15.117
My relatives?

57:15.197 --> 57:16.517
We just sent them
up to your house.

57:16.637 --> 57:18.316
What did
they look like?

57:18.436 --> 57:20.317
See, there was
this big guy

57:20.437 --> 57:21.717
and this older woman
who was...

57:21.797 --> 57:23.837
How would
you describe her?

57:23.917 --> 57:25.397
Scary beyond all reason.

57:25.477 --> 57:26.877
Yeah, that's it.

57:27.558 --> 57:30.158
So, remind me again how
you're related to Pacha?

57:30.238 --> 57:31.957
Why, I'm his
third cousin's brother's

57:32.077 --> 57:35.358
wife's step-niece's
great-aunt. Heh heh.

57:35.438 --> 57:38.638
Twice removed.

57:38.758 --> 57:39.758
Uh-huh.

57:39.878 --> 57:41.759
Isn't that right, Kronk?

57:41.879 --> 57:44.199
99 monkeys
jumpin' on the bed

57:44.279 --> 57:47.318
One fell off
and bumped his head

57:47.438 --> 57:51.119
You know, I am so sorry that
you had to come all this way,

57:51.279 --> 57:52.919
but as I said to you before,

57:52.999 --> 57:55.799
you may recall,
Pacha is not here.

57:55.919 --> 57:57.400
I'll be sure and tell him
you came by.

57:57.520 --> 58:01.599
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.

58:01.719 --> 58:04.120
Oops. Silly me.

58:04.240 --> 58:06.520
No, no. Allow me.

58:11.481 --> 58:12.921
She's hiding something.

58:13.001 --> 58:14.400
When I give the word,
we search the house.

58:14.480 --> 58:16.200
Ok, but I still have
94 monkeys to go.

58:16.280 --> 58:17.800
Grr!

58:17.920 --> 58:21.081
So, while we're
waiting for Paca--

58:21.161 --> 58:22.761
Pacha.

58:22.841 --> 58:24.241
Oh, yes.

58:24.321 --> 58:26.762
Perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

58:26.842 --> 58:28.761
You know, why don't
you just come back

58:28.841 --> 58:30.321
when Pacha gets home?

58:30.401 --> 58:33.442
I'm sure he'd love
to show you the...

58:33.522 --> 58:35.442
Excuse me, won't you?

58:35.522 --> 58:38.282
I think I left
something in the oven.

58:38.362 --> 58:40.283
This is my variation
of double-dutch.

58:40.363 --> 58:41.723
On the signal,
we switch places.

58:41.803 --> 58:43.162
Kronk, it's time!

58:43.242 --> 58:44.162
ok!

58:44.242 --> 58:45.962
Ohh!

58:46.042 --> 58:47.883
So, we have to get
back to the palace,

58:48.003 --> 58:49.443
find the lab,
and change him back.

58:49.563 --> 58:50.483
Hi there!

58:50.563 --> 58:51.483
Aah!

58:51.563 --> 58:54.003
- That was him.
- Whoops.

58:55.844 --> 58:56.963
You know what?

58:57.083 --> 58:59.203
I don't believe you're
really my great-aunt.

58:59.323 --> 59:01.523
You're more like
my great-great-great...

59:01.643 --> 59:03.284
Go. I'll stall them
long enough

59:03.364 --> 59:04.364
for you two to get
a head start.

59:04.524 --> 59:05.884
Thanks, honey.

59:06.004 --> 59:07.884
You have a lovely wife.

59:08.004 --> 59:09.125
They're both very pretty.

59:09.205 --> 59:10.365
Great-great-
great...

59:10.485 --> 59:12.964
Grr! All right!

59:13.084 --> 59:14.844
Are you through?

59:14.924 --> 59:15.844
...great-great-aunt.

59:15.924 --> 59:16.885
So, where were we?

59:17.005 --> 59:18.365
Listen, sister, we're
not leaving until--

59:18.485 --> 59:20.325
I show you the house.
Of course.

59:20.405 --> 59:23.806
Was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

59:23.886 --> 59:26.565
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

59:26.685 --> 59:28.565
What do you mean,
the door is stuck?

59:28.685 --> 59:30.285
Try jiggling the handle.

59:30.365 --> 59:32.046
There is no handle
in here.

59:32.166 --> 59:34.366
There's not?
Are you sure?

59:34.486 --> 59:36.366
All right, I've had
enough of this.

59:36.446 --> 59:38.407
Tell us where
the talking llama is

59:38.527 --> 59:40.006
and we'll burn your house
to the ground.

59:40.086 --> 59:41.726
Uh,
don't you mean "or"?

59:41.846 --> 59:44.206
Tell us where
the talking llama is

59:44.286 --> 59:46.287
or we'll burn your house
to the ground.

59:46.407 --> 59:47.807
Well, which is it?

59:47.887 --> 59:50.167
That seems like
a pretty crucial conjunction.

59:50.247 --> 59:52.447
That's it!
Kronk, break the door down!

59:52.567 --> 59:54.447
Break it down?
Are you kidding me?

59:54.567 --> 59:55.847
This is hand-carved
mahogany.

59:55.927 --> 59:58.287
I don't care, you fool.
Get out of my way.

59:58.407 --> 59:59.687
I'll break it down myself.

59:59.767 --> 01:00:01.088
A-one

01:00:01.168 --> 01:00:02.528
Ok, kids,
you know what to do.

01:00:03.608 --> 01:00:04.888
Right, Mom!

01:00:05.048 --> 01:00:06.048
3!

01:00:07.287 --> 01:00:08.648
Aah!

01:00:17.409 --> 01:00:20.129
Ok, children,
on your mark,

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:22.369
get set, go!

01:00:24.009 --> 01:00:26.729
Ow! Ow! Stop it,
you little brats! Huh?

01:00:28.089 --> 01:00:29.209
Ow!

01:00:29.289 --> 01:00:32.970
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!

01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:36.249
Ha ha ha! Well,
I had a great time.

01:00:36.329 --> 01:00:38.250
Let's not wait until
the next family reunion

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:39.530
to get together.

01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:40.690
Kronk!

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:43.290
I, uh, I gotta run.

01:01:51.495 --> 01:01:53.815
Ok, why does she even
have that lever?

01:01:57.096 --> 01:01:58.496
Please remain seated

01:01:58.616 --> 01:02:00.495
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times

01:02:01.615 --> 01:02:03.135
Aah!

01:02:04.696 --> 01:02:05.696
Huh?

01:02:07.736 --> 01:02:09.336
What does it look like?

01:02:09.456 --> 01:02:10.816
I don't know.
Just keep looking.

01:02:10.896 --> 01:02:12.177
Over here!

01:02:12.297 --> 01:02:16.296
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...

01:02:16.376 --> 01:02:18.216
Oh, my

01:02:18.336 --> 01:02:20.857
Looking for this?

01:02:22.617 --> 01:02:24.017
No! It can't be!

01:02:24.137 --> 01:02:26.017
How did you get
back here before us?

01:02:26.098 --> 01:02:29.617
Uh...how did we, Kronk?

01:02:29.697 --> 01:02:31.097
Well, you got me.

01:02:31.177 --> 01:02:33.017
By all accounts,
it doesn't make sense.

01:02:33.137 --> 01:02:35.298
Oh, well,
back to business.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:36.818
Ok, I admit it.

01:02:36.898 --> 01:02:38.978
Maybe I wasn't as nice
as I should have been,

01:02:39.098 --> 01:02:41.819
but, Yzma, do you
really want to kill me?

01:02:41.899 --> 01:02:45.378
Just think of it
as you're being let go,

01:02:45.458 --> 01:02:47.458
that your life's going
in a different direction,

01:02:47.538 --> 01:02:51.059
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

01:02:51.179 --> 01:02:53.059
Hey, that's kind of like
what he said to you

01:02:53.179 --> 01:02:54.299
when you got fired.

01:02:54.379 --> 01:02:57.299
I know. It's called
a cruel irony--

01:02:57.379 --> 01:02:59.299
like my dependence
on you.

01:02:59.379 --> 01:03:00.979
I can't believe
this is happening!

01:03:01.059 --> 01:03:03.300
Then I bet you weren't
expecting this

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.780
- No!
- Aah!

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.340
Aha!

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.900
Oh, ok.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.021
Ha ha!
Finish them off.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.380
Hey, you're
not backing down now,

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.300
are you, big guy?

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.501
Uh, where's the other guy?

01:03:19.581 --> 01:03:20.501
Yo!

01:03:20.581 --> 01:03:23.101
Sorry I'm late.
So, what'd I miss?

01:03:23.261 --> 01:03:24.781
Well, Yzma just
tossed me this knife

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:27.221
and asked me to,
you know, take them out.

01:03:27.301 --> 01:03:30.141
Then this guy popped up
and we waited for you,

01:03:30.261 --> 01:03:31.221
and quite honestly--

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:34.102
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

01:03:34.222 --> 01:03:35.582
This one simple thing.

01:03:35.702 --> 01:03:37.102
It's like I'm talking
to a monkey.

01:03:37.222 --> 01:03:38.262
Whoa now.

01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:41.382
A really, really big
stupid monkey named Kronk!

01:03:41.502 --> 01:03:42.422
Ouch.

01:03:42.542 --> 01:03:44.022
And do you want
to know something else?

01:03:44.102 --> 01:03:46.583
I've never liked
your spinach puffs.

01:03:46.703 --> 01:03:48.143
Never!

01:03:50.423 --> 01:03:52.183
That's it.
She's going down.

01:03:52.263 --> 01:03:54.183
Now, now,
remember, guys.

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:56.983
From above, the wicked shall
receive their just reward.

01:03:59.423 --> 01:04:01.384
That'll work.

01:04:08.904 --> 01:04:10.824
Strange.
That usually works.

01:04:10.944 --> 01:04:12.104
And so does this!

01:04:12.184 --> 01:04:13.944
Ah. Should have
seen that coming.

01:04:14.104 --> 01:04:15.585
Whoa!

01:04:15.705 --> 01:04:17.465
Aah!

01:04:17.545 --> 01:04:20.385
Give me that vial!

01:04:20.465 --> 01:04:21.384
Oof!.

01:04:21.464 --> 01:04:23.225
Ah! Ha ha!

01:04:23.305 --> 01:04:24.745
Aah!

01:04:28.545 --> 01:04:30.746
Oops. Clumsy me.

01:04:32.186 --> 01:04:34.226
Which one? Which one?

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:39.626
Better hurry
I'm expecting company

01:04:43.106 --> 01:04:46.707
Kill them!
They murdered the emperor!

01:04:46.827 --> 01:04:49.506
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me--Kuzco!

01:04:49.626 --> 01:04:51.506
They're not
listening to me!

01:04:51.626 --> 01:04:53.507
Just take 'em all!

01:04:53.627 --> 01:04:55.427
- Yaah!
- Yaah!

01:05:01.028 --> 01:05:01.948
Get them!

01:05:02.028 --> 01:05:03.867
Hey, I've been
turned into a cow.

01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:05.467
Can I go home?

01:05:05.587 --> 01:05:07.228
You're excused.
Anyone else?

01:05:07.348 --> 01:05:08.828
All: No, we're good.

01:05:08.908 --> 01:05:10.028
Get them!

01:05:10.148 --> 01:05:13.308
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.

01:05:15.909 --> 01:05:17.868
Uh, Pacha?
A little help!

01:05:20.348 --> 01:05:21.949
Come on!
Come on!

01:05:26.869 --> 01:05:29.310
Aah!

01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:31.590
Oh, please be
something with wings.

01:05:33.989 --> 01:05:36.750
Yeah! We're flyin'!

01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:38.270
Uh-oh!

01:05:43.911 --> 01:05:45.231
We're not getting anywhere
with you picking the vials.

01:05:45.311 --> 01:05:46.510
I'm picking the next one!

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:48.070
Fine by me!

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:49.230
Give me that one!

01:05:50.551 --> 01:05:52.231
Don't you say a word.

01:05:52.351 --> 01:05:56.071
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:05:57.872 --> 01:05:59.232
Quick!
Drain the canals!

01:06:00.911 --> 01:06:02.151
Pacha: Open up!

01:06:05.072 --> 01:06:07.432
Yay! I'm a llama again!

01:06:07.512 --> 01:06:08.632
Wait...

01:06:10.632 --> 01:06:11.992
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:06:17.752 --> 01:06:19.873
There they go!
After them!

01:06:20.033 --> 01:06:22.953
Come on, men!
Nobody lives forever! Charge!

01:06:25.313 --> 01:06:27.354
Aah!

01:06:27.434 --> 01:06:30.593
Grr!

01:06:37.954 --> 01:06:41.074
Aah!

01:06:41.194 --> 01:06:44.434
Ok, only 2 left. It's
gotta be one of these.

01:06:49.115 --> 01:06:50.035
No!

01:06:52.595 --> 01:06:57.315
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!

01:06:59.395 --> 01:07:00.315
Meow.

01:07:00.395 --> 01:07:02.795
I'll take that.

01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:05.316
This is the one. This'll
change you back to a human.

01:07:05.436 --> 01:07:09.116
Ow! Hey, get her off!.

01:07:09.236 --> 01:07:10.156
Whoa!

01:07:10.236 --> 01:07:11.556
Get her off me!

01:07:14.156 --> 01:07:15.796
Aah! Ow!

01:07:19.757 --> 01:07:20.877
Drink the potion!

01:07:20.997 --> 01:07:22.757
Ok, ok! Aah!

01:07:22.837 --> 01:07:25.076
Where did it go?
Where is it?

01:07:25.157 --> 01:07:27.637
Looking for this?

01:07:27.717 --> 01:07:29.477
Is that my voice?

01:07:29.557 --> 01:07:30.957
Is that my voice?

01:07:31.037 --> 01:07:33.078
Oh, well.

01:07:33.158 --> 01:07:34.318
No! Don't drop it!

01:07:34.438 --> 01:07:36.878
I'm not going
to drop it, you fool!

01:07:36.998 --> 01:07:39.197
I'm going to drink it!

01:07:39.317 --> 01:07:42.198
And once I turn back
into my beautiful self,

01:07:42.318 --> 01:07:44.198
I'm going to kill you!

01:07:44.318 --> 01:07:48.199
Ha ha ha!

01:07:53.558 --> 01:07:54.479
Aah!

01:07:54.559 --> 01:07:55.879
Aah! Uh-oh.

01:07:55.999 --> 01:07:57.359
Yzma: Aah!

01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:01.039
Aah!

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.120
Aah! Aah!

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.360
Uhh! Whoa!

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.120
Uhh! Oh-oh-oh!

01:08:17.241 --> 01:08:18.520
Kuzco!

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.041
Be right there!
Give me a minute!

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:22.640
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.201
Kuzco! Whoa!

01:08:26.401 --> 01:08:27.401
Kuzco!

01:08:28.401 --> 01:08:31.162
Aah!

01:08:31.242 --> 01:08:32.642
Oh.

01:08:34.562 --> 01:08:35.640
The vial!

01:08:40.402 --> 01:08:44.482
Aah!

01:08:44.602 --> 01:08:46.082
For the last time,

01:08:46.162 --> 01:08:48.203
we did not order
a giant trampoline.

01:08:48.323 --> 01:08:49.881
You know, pal, you
could have told me that

01:08:49.962 --> 01:08:51.642
before I set it up.

01:08:52.763 --> 01:08:55.443
Aah!

01:08:55.563 --> 01:08:57.723
Aah! Uhh--

01:08:57.803 --> 01:08:59.042
Huh? Ha ha ha.

01:08:59.122 --> 01:09:01.564
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:09:01.644 --> 01:09:03.323
Hoo hoo hee hee
ha ha ha--

01:09:06.923 --> 01:09:08.243
The vial!

01:09:08.323 --> 01:09:10.404
You thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

01:09:27.524 --> 01:09:29.246
Ah ha ha ha ha!

01:09:29.326 --> 01:09:30.446
I win.

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:31.486
Whoa.

01:09:33.645 --> 01:09:35.604
Got it!

01:09:35.685 --> 01:09:38.606
What are the odds of that
trapdoor leading me out here?

01:09:40.486 --> 01:09:42.086
Yeah!

01:09:43.246 --> 01:09:44.167
Uhh.

01:09:46.206 --> 01:09:48.765
Here, uh, let me
get this for you.

01:09:51.167 --> 01:09:54.247
Well, see ya
on the other side.

01:10:03.367 --> 01:10:04.847
Old man: Oh, now,
you--you

01:10:04.927 --> 01:10:06.888
you stop being
so hard on yourself.

01:10:06.968 --> 01:10:07.888
All is forgiven.

01:10:07.968 --> 01:10:09.128
You're sure?

01:10:09.208 --> 01:10:11.568
Oh, it's not the first time
I was tossed out a window,

01:10:11.688 --> 01:10:13.209
and it won't be the last.

01:10:13.329 --> 01:10:15.368
What can I say?
I'm a rebel.

01:10:15.448 --> 01:10:16.688
Whoa-ho-ho, tiger.

01:10:16.768 --> 01:10:19.008
Oh! Hey, I got to
use that arm later.

01:10:19.088 --> 01:10:20.809
Ok, buddy, take care.

01:10:20.889 --> 01:10:23.409
Ha ha.
Ah, he's a sweet guy.

01:10:33.249 --> 01:10:35.770
So, you lied to me

01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:37.770
I did?

01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:40.050
Yeah. You said
when the sun

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:41.370
hits this ridge
just right,

01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:42.930
these hills sing.

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:45.130
Well, pal, I was dragged
all over those hills,

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:48.570
and I did not hear
any singing.

01:10:50.411 --> 01:10:51.371
So

01:10:51.531 --> 01:10:53.011
I'll be building
my summer home

01:10:53.131 --> 01:10:57.091
on a more magical hill.
Thank you.

01:10:59.331 --> 01:11:02.131
Hmm. Couldn't pull the wool
over your eyes, huh?

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:04.012
No, no, I'm sharp,
I'm on it.

01:11:04.092 --> 01:11:05.292
Looks like you
and your family

01:11:05.412 --> 01:11:07.652
are stuck on that tuneless
hill top forever, pal.

01:11:16.612 --> 01:11:19.053
You know, I'm pretty sure
I heard some singing

01:11:19.133 --> 01:11:21.613
on the hill next to us.

01:11:21.773 --> 01:11:23.133
In case you're interested.

01:11:27.893 --> 01:11:29.493
Ha! Boom, baby!

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:31.733
Ha! Boom, baby!

01:11:35.814 --> 01:11:37.254
You'd be the coolest dude

01:11:37.334 --> 01:11:38.653
In the nation

01:11:38.773 --> 01:11:40.534
Or the hippest cat
in creation

01:11:40.654 --> 01:11:43.734
But if you ain't got friends,
then nothing's worth the fuss

01:11:45.454 --> 01:11:47.414
A perfect world
will come to be

01:11:47.494 --> 01:11:49.815
When everybody here
can see

01:11:49.935 --> 01:11:52.135
That a perfect world
begins and ends

01:11:52.255 --> 01:11:54.374
A perfect world
begins and ends

01:11:54.494 --> 01:11:57.215
A perfect world
begins and ends with us

01:11:58.495 --> 01:12:00.255
" My acorn
is missing."

01:12:00.335 --> 01:12:02.336
Squeak squeakin'
squeak squeakity.

01:12:02.456 --> 01:12:03.976
" Did you eat
the acorn?"

01:12:04.096 --> 01:12:06.176
Squeaker squeak
squeak squeakin'?

01:12:06.296 --> 01:12:08.095
"You owe me
a new acorn."

01:12:08.175 --> 01:12:10.456
Squeak squeak squeak
squeak squeaker--

01:12:12.576 --> 01:12:13.696
Squeakin'.

01:12:13.196 --> 01:12:13.816
I'm so proud of you guys.
