WEBVTT

00:03.303 --> 00:05.772
[man and woman moaning]

00:09.576 --> 00:11.544
[Lauren stops moaning]

00:13.613 --> 00:16.049
[both pant heavily]

00:18.000 --> 00:18.718
[Lauren sighs]

00:18.785 --> 00:19.853
[Matt] That was...

00:21.588 --> 00:23.089
Our second time.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.465
I only came over to give you
a fresh batch of Kefir.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.934
Yeah, thank you for that.
Appreciate it.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.938
This one's made
with coconut water,

00:39.005 --> 00:40.673
kind of has a different--

00:42.000 --> 00:42.175
-Smell?
-Hm.

00:42.242 --> 00:43.777
Hey listen, um...

00:44.944 --> 00:46.079
Do you
mind if I--

00:46.146 --> 00:47.514
If you left? No that's fine.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.083
-No! I can stay.
-Good.

00:52.018 --> 00:52.986
Come here.

00:54.487 --> 00:55.622
Move.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.592
-Spoons?
-Okay.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.594
Oh I see. There you go.

01:02.429 --> 01:04.030
There we go.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.201
Matt, don't take this
the wrong way, but um,

01:08.268 --> 01:10.937
I'm sort of used to
sleeping on my own and--

01:11.004 --> 01:11.938
[Matt] So I am.

01:12.005 --> 01:16.242
Maybe it's best if you
go back to your place.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.012
Hm, I knew you'd
understand because...

01:19.078 --> 01:21.848
[Matt snores]

01:24.000 --> 01:24.717
Matt?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.858
# I'm like a candle burning
End to end #

01:32.892 --> 01:33.893
And then he farted.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.295
[Helena laughs]
Of course he did.

01:36.000 --> 01:36.696
It's like I'm literally
two seconds away

01:36.763 --> 01:37.664
from doing his bloody washing.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.667
So, to counter this.
You're going to?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.203
[Lauren gurgles]

01:43.269 --> 01:44.471
Yep, sex party.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.806
It's not like some
dodgy Louis Theroux,

01:46.873 --> 01:47.941
sort of swingers party.

01:48.007 --> 01:51.911
It's an exclusive,
invite only, sex party.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.012
And you got an invite how?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.348
Ah, the celebrity,
I believe the term is,

01:55.415 --> 01:56.783
"slid into my DM's"?

01:56.850 --> 01:57.817
What's his name?

01:57.884 --> 01:59.085
Um, I signed an NDA.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.453
You've never heard of him,
have you?

02:00.520 --> 02:05.291
Nope, but apparently he's
a major, in-fluenza.

02:06.000 --> 02:06.593
[Helen] Influenza!?

02:06.659 --> 02:07.961
Honestly, sometimes
I'm astonished

02:08.027 --> 02:08.895
you have a law degree.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.531
He's very famous, apparently.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
He's very sexy
and he's invited me,

02:14.067 --> 02:15.935
to an exclusive sex party.

02:16.002 --> 02:17.203
Oh, and um, apparently
there's going to be

02:18.000 --> 02:19.172
a chocolate fountain
there as well, so.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.508
Oh, well that explains it then.

02:21.574 --> 02:23.910
Wait, so where is
this sex party, anyway?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.412
It's in Olivedale,
about four hours away.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.715
You're making Alex drive you
four hours to a sex party?

02:30.000 --> 02:30.850
No, she's not.

02:30.917 --> 02:34.787
Hi. No, Rhys and I are going to
a silent retreat this weekend.

02:34.854 --> 02:35.922
[Helena laughs]

02:36.000 --> 02:37.590
No, no.
It's actually not funny.

02:37.657 --> 02:38.525
[Lauren giggles]

02:38.591 --> 02:40.059
No, you get a fancy
celebrity sex party,

02:40.126 --> 02:41.761
and I get a room
full of sea-glass matting

02:42.000 --> 02:42.929
that smells like feet.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.431
Well maybe someone will
touch your mula bandha.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.400
-Should I take my neck pillow?
-Why?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.202
Wait, so how are
you getting there?

02:49.269 --> 02:50.236
I'm getting the train,

02:50.303 --> 02:52.639
and then I'm meeting him
at a rendezvous point.

02:52.705 --> 02:53.506
Oh Jesus Christ.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.376
You just love having a
rendezvous point, don't you?

02:56.442 --> 02:57.644
Oh, have you heard
from Mum and Dad?

02:57.710 --> 02:58.645
They were meant to send me

03:00.000 --> 03:00.313
their flight details
from Beijing.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.081
Should I take one or two?

03:02.148 --> 03:03.182
I'm not answering that.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.684
Well, I don't want
to be unprepared.

03:04.751 --> 03:05.718
[knocking on window]

03:06.000 --> 03:06.886
Hi!

03:06.953 --> 03:07.787
Gross.

03:08.054 --> 03:10.456
[Helena] Did you just throw
a fucking dildo at me?

03:10.523 --> 03:11.591
Hi.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.894
Oh, wow!
[laughing]

03:14.961 --> 03:17.797
Oh, this is unexpected.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.198
Hello, Floss.

03:19.265 --> 03:22.802
Oh my gosh, I have to
take my bloody bra off.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.004
Put the kettle on, Bosslett.
Have you got any Earl Grey?

03:25.071 --> 03:27.273
-No, I don't have Earl Grey.
-Clipper Organic?

03:27.340 --> 03:29.909
Why are you here? I mean,
it's lovely to see you, but--

03:30.000 --> 03:33.680
Well, I mean, we were so close,
so we just thought, why not?

03:33.746 --> 03:34.614
I'll put it on.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.115
You were in China.

03:36.182 --> 03:38.084
Um, I don't have Clipper, Dad.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.285
Oh, English Breakfast?

03:39.352 --> 03:41.321
Oh, hello.
What a lovely surprise.

03:42.000 --> 03:42.155
I packed the big one.

03:42.221 --> 03:44.424
Oh, hello Alex.
Good to see you.

03:44.490 --> 03:45.525
Oh, Alex, hi.

03:45.592 --> 03:46.359
[groans]

03:46.426 --> 03:47.393
Sorry, I had to
take my bra off.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.562
Don't mind me.
Bloody long trip.

03:49.629 --> 03:50.863
Come here.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.099
So um, how long
are you staying?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.335
Oh, I don't know.
A week? Two?

03:55.401 --> 03:56.736
You know,
we haven't decided.

03:56.803 --> 03:57.637
[chicken clucks]

03:57.704 --> 03:58.938
-What's wrong?
-No, nothing.

03:59.005 --> 03:59.973
Is this all you've
got Bosslett?

04:00.206 --> 04:02.008
And, and did you know there's
a chicken in your kitchen?

04:02.075 --> 04:02.842
Yes.

04:02.909 --> 04:03.710
Where will you sleep?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.246
Ah, we've got an RV,
with an awning.

04:07.313 --> 04:08.781
Oh wow.

04:08.848 --> 04:09.949
Oh, but unfortunately,

04:12.000 --> 04:12.051
I do have to go to
a work thing tonight.

04:12.118 --> 04:14.120
It's an awards thingy.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.922
Yeah, I should get
going too, actually.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.490
Ooh, an awards. What for?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.192
Uh, an industry thingy.

04:19.258 --> 04:20.660
Um, it's peer reviewed.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.230
Yeah, it's uh, she's up
for Most Intrepid.

04:24.297 --> 04:25.164
Okay. I've got to go.

04:25.365 --> 04:27.266
It's perfect timing.
We can look after the kids.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.701
After we've had a cup of tea.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.603
Okay. Actually the kids
are with Jake this weekend.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.939
Uh no, they're not.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.641
I, I called him
on the way here.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.043
They're coming over
in a minute.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.511
Awe.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.680
[upbeat music]

04:43.082 --> 04:44.617
Package deal.

04:44.684 --> 04:46.486
Got all the bits and bobs
along with it.

04:46.552 --> 04:47.320
Oh.

04:48.000 --> 04:48.187
Good, isn't it?

04:48.254 --> 04:49.022
It's quite big.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.456
[girls] Nana!

04:50.523 --> 04:52.892
Oh, girls! Hello!
Oh my darlings!

04:54.000 --> 04:54.894
[Roger chuckles]
Darling.

04:54.961 --> 04:55.828
Oh my goat.

04:55.895 --> 04:56.729
Is that yours?

04:56.796 --> 04:58.164
Oh my goat, yes it is.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.499
Where's Daddy?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.269
He's rewiring an electrical
accumulation meter.

05:03.336 --> 05:04.370
But he says, hi.

05:06.000 --> 05:06.172
A bit of a surprise visit
from Grandpa and Nana.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.008
I'm afraid the work awards
thingy is out of town,

05:09.075 --> 05:10.576
but you guys
can just hang here.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.245
Oh no darling,
we want to see you as well.

05:12.311 --> 05:13.446
How far away is this award--

05:13.513 --> 05:14.681
I fancy a bit of travelling.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.516
Yeah, no, no it's out
in Olivedale, Dad.

05:18.000 --> 05:18.518
Rog, isn't Chateau Baskerville
in Olivedale?

05:18.584 --> 05:21.187
That's right.
Fantastic architecture.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.388
Is it full of hounds?

05:24.000 --> 05:24.257
I think they've got a
camping ground there,

05:24.323 --> 05:25.992
so we could stay over night.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.060
[girls cheering]

05:27.126 --> 05:27.593
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:28.227 --> 05:29.562
Not after your flight.
It's like a four hour drive.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.563
We didn't get the RV

05:30.630 --> 05:31.964
just to park up in your
driveway, Bosslett.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.166
[Carol] Oh darling,
do you know what?

05:36.000 --> 05:36.436
I think they've just curated
a snake dungeon there, too.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.470
A snake dungeon?

05:37.537 --> 05:39.238
I would love a dungeon.

05:42.000 --> 05:42.442
Yeah, please, Mum?
Come on? It sounds weird.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.510
-Come on, let's look in the RV.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:44.577 --> 05:47.113
I don't think there's going to
be time for snakes or dungeons.

05:48.000 --> 05:48.948
My work thing's at six and

05:49.015 --> 05:50.450
ah, it's half twelve,
I got to get a move on Mum.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.617
You know, I've got to
shower and change,

05:51.684 --> 05:52.885
I got to get to
the train station.

05:52.952 --> 05:53.786
Train station?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.755
Yes darling, where,
where is your car?

05:55.822 --> 05:57.123
Mummy got arrested.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.991
She got a three months
suspension.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.159
The car got squashed.

06:00.226 --> 06:02.161
Ah, that's.
Drinking?

06:02.228 --> 06:03.329
Wow.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.698
[Roger] Well it looks like
it's settled. We're driving.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.735
Don't worry, plenty of time
for snakes and showers.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.002
Great.

06:12.000 --> 06:12.305
[Carol] I think we can
actually take the C425.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.240
[Roger] No, that's okay.
I've got the sat nav.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.441
That'll tell us the best route.

06:15.508 --> 06:17.844
[Carol] We don't need the
sat nav. I know where we are.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.779
But, I like to know
exactly where we are.

06:19.846 --> 06:20.947
Yeah, Mum,
if we're going to go,

06:21.013 --> 06:22.682
let's, let's use the sat nav.
It'll be quicker.

06:22.749 --> 06:23.950
Grandpa, two across.

06:24.016 --> 06:26.719
Lessening of tension
in political affairs.

06:26.786 --> 06:27.587
Seven letters.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.922
-Detenty?
-Detente.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.858
Detente. Let's go.

06:31.924 --> 06:32.625
Let's get your sleeping bags.

06:32.692 --> 06:33.593
Sleeping bags?

06:33.659 --> 06:35.661
No, we should get their
rain coats, Carol.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.697
-A bit drizzly up there.
-Oh, yes.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.766
Oh, and we can
make a packed lunch.

06:39.832 --> 06:41.300
I could make pasties.

06:42.000 --> 06:42.869
Oh no, you don't have
to make pasties, Mum.

06:42.935 --> 06:44.036
You don't have to make them.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.671
-[girls cheering]
-Fine, I won't make pasties.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.306
Can we just get in
the fucking van?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.108
Please?

06:49.408 --> 06:50.476
[upbeat music]

06:50.543 --> 06:51.577
[Lola] I'm hungry.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.446
[Carol] I told you we
should've made pasties.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.014
[Lauren] Abby,
give her the cherries.

06:58.417 --> 06:59.318
[items crashing]

07:00.000 --> 07:00.286
[Carol] What was that?

07:00.353 --> 07:01.254
[girls scream]

07:01.320 --> 07:03.256
-[Abby] What the?
-[Lauren] Mum, sit down!

07:03.322 --> 07:04.624
[Lauren screaming]

07:04.690 --> 07:05.491
[items crashing]

07:06.000 --> 07:07.527
You should have stacked the
cups and plates properly,
Lauren.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.428
Yes, I know. I did stack them.

07:09.495 --> 07:10.630
[Abby] Ah Mum, come here.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.965
Well clearly that cupboard
door was not secured properly.

07:13.032 --> 07:15.201
I didn't know you were going to
get the bloody tea stuff out.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.502
[Abby vomits]

07:18.000 --> 07:18.237
[Lauren screams]

07:18.938 --> 07:20.239
Oh, baby.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.608
[gentle music]

07:24.811 --> 07:26.145
Oh baby.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.381
Going to have to fill
the water tank soon.

07:28.447 --> 07:29.348
Nearly out.

07:30.516 --> 07:33.152
Gross, Grandpa.
This really stinks.

07:33.219 --> 07:35.888
Not as bad as your porridge
vomit, when you were a toddler.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.690
We even named a
lay-by after you.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.091
Lola's vomit spot.

07:39.158 --> 07:40.393
[mimics vomiting]

07:40.459 --> 07:41.227
[Lola laughs]

07:42.000 --> 07:43.262
You are a weird Grandpa.

07:43.329 --> 07:44.764
Are you feeling okay?

07:44.831 --> 07:47.266
I'm never eating
cherries ever again.

07:48.000 --> 07:48.968
Yeah, you ate the whole punnet,
didn't you?

07:49.035 --> 07:49.802
Maybe.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.404
Yeah, I'll get you a drink.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.940
All right, let's get
your hair, darling.

07:54.006 --> 07:55.308
Oh God.

07:55.374 --> 07:57.410
[Lauren sighs]

07:58.077 --> 07:58.911
Nanny loves you.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.179
Here you are, my darling.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.081
Just drink this water.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.250
-Here, I've got that.
-I've got it.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.885
Yeah, not too, not too much,
she'll be sick again!

08:06.000 --> 08:07.453
[Abby exclaims]

08:07.520 --> 08:08.487
-Fine.
-Sorry.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.156
Nanny's useless.

08:12.000 --> 08:12.024
[Lauren mutters]

08:14.126 --> 08:17.396
Right. Shall we go
to a snake dungeon?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.599
-I guess so.
-Yay!

08:25.104 --> 08:27.974
Ah! Wow, here we are.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.076
Great. Fantastic.

08:30.142 --> 08:31.377
Okay.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.248
Great.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.316
Let's go. Brilliant.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.152
Great, come on Dad.

08:42.000 --> 08:42.588
Yep, good, good, good.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.124
I don't want to miss my lift
to the awards thingy.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.192
Yeah? Ready?

08:46.259 --> 08:47.326
[RV beeps]

08:48.000 --> 08:48.227
[Lauren sighs]

08:48.294 --> 08:50.696
-Just get the broom.
-You're sweeping?

08:50.763 --> 08:52.899
Okay, so I'm going
to go ahead, Mum.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.100
You can catch up, okay?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.035
Don't be so hard on your Mum.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.236
She's just trying to help.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.239
Yeah, I know, but she's
just so overbearing.

09:00.306 --> 09:01.407
[RV door closes]

09:02.575 --> 09:04.277
God, I stink.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.445
Giddy up Mum,
I want to see the dungeon.

09:06.512 --> 09:07.313
And, you shall.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.214
Okay.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.783
Hello.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.185
Welcome to Chateau Baskerville.

09:13.252 --> 09:16.622
Home of the infamous,
dead Count Baskerville,

09:18.000 --> 09:19.525
and his magical menagerie
of curated creatures.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.462
Uh, my name is Greg.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.165
You can call me Sir Greg,
if you want.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.334
Or just Greg. Greg's fine.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.737
I'll be your guide today.
Lucky you.

09:31.804 --> 09:32.672
Ah, thank you.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.342
Oh, wow. Apparently
there's a big python

09:36.409 --> 09:38.444
called Neville,
in the snake dungeon.

09:38.511 --> 09:39.712
Oh.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.347
Come on, darlings.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.350
Let's go see Neville the snake.

09:48.000 --> 09:48.187
Did you know, that Python's
can swallow a wild pig whole?

09:48.254 --> 09:50.990
No, I didn't know that.

09:54.000 --> 09:54.226
And how big is a
wild pig, typically?

09:54.293 --> 09:56.429
Human sort of size.
Your size.

09:56.495 --> 09:59.365
I'm the size of
a wild pig? Wow!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.667
I have to be
somewhere at five,

10:01.734 --> 10:03.169
so how long does this take?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.473
I can make it last
as long as you want.

10:08.774 --> 10:09.608
Okay.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.245
Is that vomit?

10:13.312 --> 10:15.815
Yeah, it is.

10:15.881 --> 10:16.983
Awesome.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.186
[upbeat music]

10:24.123 --> 10:26.058
[Roger] This is more like it.

10:26.125 --> 10:26.926
[chuckles]

10:26.993 --> 10:27.727
Lovely.

10:27.793 --> 10:28.995
Come on, everybody out.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.097
-Oh, wow.
-Here we go.

10:31.163 --> 10:33.499
Whoa! Look over here!
Let's race!

10:34.133 --> 10:35.534
Dad, does the shower
in the RV work?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.236
Yeah. Good to go.
Internal tank.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.739
Great. Yeah, thanks Mum.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.207
[vehicle arriving]

10:42.000 --> 10:42.708
Oh, God.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.778
Hi Nancy. Hey!

10:48.000 --> 10:48.514
Chateau Baskerville.
Incredible, right?

10:48.581 --> 10:50.883
Yeah. Why? Why?
Why are you here?

10:50.950 --> 10:53.753
Well, poor, lonely Angus
had an anxiety attack.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.921
Oh, really?

10:55.988 --> 10:57.656
Yeah, I popped over
to feed her.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.525
She was having
a complete meltdown.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.727
I think she's
still quite damaged.

11:01.794 --> 11:04.330
And I tried to get onto Jake,
but he was tied up,

11:06.000 --> 11:06.432
but he mentioned that
you were at the Chateau.

11:07.299 --> 11:08.367
Yes. Oh Mum, this is Nancy.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.669
Is, is that your chicken,
darling?

11:10.736 --> 11:11.570
Mm-hmm.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.305
Carol? So nice to
meet you in person.

11:13.372 --> 11:14.540
Yeah, I was just saying,

11:14.607 --> 11:17.710
chickens actually form a very
strong bond to their mother.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.712
It's good of you to bring
her all the way out here.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.247
Well, I had a duty of care.

11:21.313 --> 11:22.648
Jake still tied up, is he?

11:24.000 --> 11:24.183
Yeah. He's working late.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.620
Hi girls. How are you?
Are you having fun?

11:27.686 --> 11:29.388
Why are you here?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.591
Well, as I was just
saying to your mummy,

11:32.658 --> 11:34.727
chickens,
especially rescue chickens,

11:36.000 --> 11:36.662
can form attachment issues.

11:36.729 --> 11:37.897
Attachment issues?

11:37.963 --> 11:39.198
Yeah, so.

11:39.799 --> 11:40.699
Here, just...

11:42.000 --> 11:42.401
Come on, Angus.

11:42.468 --> 11:43.269
[Nancy sighs]

11:43.335 --> 11:44.136
But don't worry,

11:44.537 --> 11:46.005
I bought something for her
to hang out in during the day.

11:48.000 --> 11:48.174
Obviously at night she'll
be in bed with you?

11:51.410 --> 11:53.245
I made this for
my brother's flock.

11:54.000 --> 11:54.413
Oh, look at that girls.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.182
Spare travel hutch.

11:56.248 --> 11:58.217
Well, this is very inventive.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.486
Look, these hinges are clever.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.389
Oh, it's like a little
gypsy caravan, marvellous.

12:06.000 --> 12:06.859
[sniffing]

12:06.926 --> 12:08.194
You smell like Dad.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.628
Well, it's his jumper.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.964
We share everything,
your daddy and I.

12:12.031 --> 12:14.200
Well, I'll leave this here.

12:14.266 --> 12:15.334
Thank you. Thank you
for bringing her,

12:15.401 --> 12:16.969
for no apparent reason.

12:18.000 --> 12:18.370
Just remember, you can never
over cuddle a chicken.

12:18.437 --> 12:19.271
Okay.

12:20.539 --> 12:21.340
Bye.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.374
[Roger] Lovely.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.778
[Lauren] I've got to get to
my roadside rendezvous, Angus.

12:26.378 --> 12:27.913
Gross, gross, gross, gross.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.850
[shower starts and stops]

12:30.916 --> 12:31.851
Dad!

12:31.917 --> 12:32.718
Yes, love?

12:32.785 --> 12:33.819
There's no water.

12:36.000 --> 12:36.856
Oh, hang, hang on.
The tank must be empty.

12:36.922 --> 12:37.690
Okay.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.325
I'll just hook
it up to the tap.

12:39.391 --> 12:40.392
[Angus clucks]

12:40.459 --> 12:41.760
Won't be a moment.

12:42.828 --> 12:44.697
It's not on, Dad.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.198
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.435
Oh no, the connector's
dropped off.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.536
Hold on. I'll fix it.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.971
There's no hose?

12:52.037 --> 12:53.239
Don't panic.

12:54.000 --> 12:54.807
I'm covered in vomit, Dad.

12:54.874 --> 12:56.642
Yes. All right.
Don't worry, love.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.377
I've got a connector here.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.646
[lively music]

13:01.147 --> 13:04.750
Oh, sexy. Yeah,
that'll do the trick.

13:06.000 --> 13:06.152
[Roger] Lauren?

13:06.218 --> 13:07.386
Dildo.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.521
[Angus clucks]

13:08.587 --> 13:10.289
Oh, God. I forgot my knickers.

13:12.000 --> 13:12.458
Oh, God.

13:32.811 --> 13:33.846
Wait!

13:36.000 --> 13:36.815
[car driving away]

13:38.551 --> 13:40.419
[Lauren sighs]

13:42.087 --> 13:43.422
[Helena] Are you calling
me from a sex party,

13:43.489 --> 13:44.657
because I'm at work
and I don't think,

13:44.723 --> 13:45.858
I can keep a straight face.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.593
No, I missed my rendezvous.

13:48.000 --> 13:48.861
[Helena] You missed
your rendezvous!

13:48.928 --> 13:51.697
Yeah. He left without me
and I don't have his number.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.666
[Helena] Oh well.
Who wants to shag a bunch

13:54.000 --> 13:56.402
of egotistical,
influenzas anyway.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.837
Mm. What do I do now?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.907
[Helena] Go spend time with
Mum and Dad, you nincompoop.

14:01.974 --> 14:04.944
Yeah. Helena?

14:06.000 --> 14:06.579
[Helena] What?

14:07.479 --> 14:09.415
I'm not wearing any knickers.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.317
[Helena] I don't think you
have to tell them that.

did you win?

14:34.073 --> 14:35.741
-No.
-Oh.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.610
-No, I didn't.
-Sod them.

14:37.676 --> 14:38.711
[laughing]

All tucked up in the bunk.

Snug as a bug in a rug.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.816
Great. Thank you.

14:45.851 --> 14:47.953
Shall we have a glass of wine?

14:48.020 --> 14:50.055
Well actually--

14:50.122 --> 14:52.124
It's just been such
a ridiculous day.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.425
I just feel like I've,
been so busy,

with me, rushing
and the vomit and

15:00.000 --> 15:00.766
don't feel I've had a chance
to just sit and chat.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.201
Shall I?

15:02.268 --> 15:03.535
I'm sorry, darling.
I don't think,

15:03.602 --> 15:05.771
I could keep my eyes
open for another minute.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.740
-Oh.
-Yeah, jet lag's kicking in.

15:07.806 --> 15:10.409
Jet lag. Yeah, of course.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.878
But I tell you what, let's help
you make up your bed.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.481
Oh, don't worry Mum,
I know how to do that.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.050
All right, sweet. Okay.
Good night, darling.

people get murdered, Lauren.

[sighs and moans]

16:04.330 --> 16:05.130
Oh.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.266
What?

16:07.333 --> 16:09.301
There's a fox looking at me.

16:09.368 --> 16:10.602
You don't like it?

16:10.669 --> 16:11.670
-Um.
-It's not for everyone.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.272
Let's go. Do you
want to pop up here?

16:13.339 --> 16:14.873
-Thanks very much.
-Yeah, help yourself.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.475
Settle in.
Make yourself at home.

16:16.542 --> 16:17.343
Oh, great.
That's comfortable.

16:25.417 --> 16:28.620
Did you know that pythons
have a sixth sense for heat?

16:30.000 --> 16:30.055
I didn't know that, no.

16:30.122 --> 16:31.523
Well, they do.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.025
[kissing sounds]

16:33.092 --> 16:33.992
Hang on.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.060
Legend has it,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.697
Count Baskerville was sweating
so much in his body armour,

while up a tree trying to
catch a rhinoceros hornbill.

Rhinoceros hornbill.

Have you ever seen a
glow in the dark python?

16:49.375 --> 16:50.109
No.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.044
Okay, here we go.

Ta-da!

16:56.615 --> 16:58.484
-Wow.
-Wow.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.186
Yeah, that's really taking
it to the next level.

17:01.253 --> 17:03.222
We actually sell this
in the gift shop.

17:03.288 --> 17:05.724
The lube, that is.
Not my dick.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.526
-Oh.
-Yeah.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.195
[kissing sounds]

17:13.699 --> 17:16.402
[couple moaning]

17:20.472 --> 17:23.709
[display banging]

17:24.000 --> 17:26.011
Wait, shall we try
another spot even?

17:26.078 --> 17:27.112
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.380
Yeah, all right,
let's just move it around.

17:28.447 --> 17:29.181
Okay.

17:30.000 --> 17:30.849
Where you want it?
Where, where?

17:30.916 --> 17:31.650
[display crashing]

17:31.717 --> 17:33.051
[Lauren screams]

17:33.118 --> 17:35.354
[alarm sounding]

17:37.322 --> 17:38.957
Oh, shit.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.763
[policeman sighs]

17:45.898 --> 17:47.766
Have we met?

17:48.534 --> 17:49.935
Wouldn't have thought so.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.003
No.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.706
-Again Greg?
-Again?

17:54.773 --> 17:56.375
Yeah. I'm sorry Lionel.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.343
And this time you open
Neville's enclosure.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.214
This time. So you're a serial
snake dungeon shagger, are you?

18:03.148 --> 18:04.616
What were you even
doing so close to it?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.319
Um, well, she got
scared of the taxidermy,

18:07.386 --> 18:09.188
so I was trying
to find a better spot.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.557
Well great,
now Neville's on the loose.

18:12.000 --> 18:12.391
Yeah.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.460
You know how valuable he is?

18:14.526 --> 18:15.928
Yeah I'm sorry,
I'm really sorry.

18:18.000 --> 18:18.163
It was really good fun
though wasn't it?

18:18.230 --> 18:19.364
Yeah, it really was, yeah.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.633
So sorry,
a python has escaped?

18:24.000 --> 18:24.470
Not just A python.

18:25.070 --> 18:28.540
Neville is an extremely rare,
genetically unique--

18:28.607 --> 18:29.575
Okay, sure.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.578
He got us four stars on
Trip Advisor in 2019.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.313
Four stars?
That's very impressive.

18:36.000 --> 18:36.448
But I mean, they can't move
that quickly, can they?

18:36.515 --> 18:38.884
Well approximately
1.6 kilometres per hour.

18:38.951 --> 18:39.485
Hm.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.286
-Right.
-Yeah.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.589
Well, it sounds like you've
got no time to waste.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.393
Actually, you are right.

18:49.761 --> 18:52.097
I should set up a perimeter.

18:52.164 --> 18:53.398
Get on the radio.

18:54.000 --> 18:54.833
[upbeat music]

18:54.900 --> 18:57.035
[vehicle approaching]

19:00.000 --> 19:01.273
[Lauren] Thanks. Of course
the lights were necessary.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.575
[Police Officer] Well,
it's standard procedure.

19:06.000 --> 19:06.311
Whatever, whatever.

19:06.378 --> 19:08.881
[Lauren sighs]

19:08.947 --> 19:11.750
[car driving off]

19:12.417 --> 19:15.387
Mum, what are you doing up?

19:15.454 --> 19:16.922
Do you remember when
you were about 15?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.324
You suck out to a party
leaving the back door,

19:19.391 --> 19:21.059
swinging open,
banging all night.

19:21.126 --> 19:23.962
This squeaky,
bloody door woke me up.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.698
Oh, sorry
[Lauren exhales]

19:27.065 --> 19:29.401
Why did you just
get out of a police car?

19:30.002 --> 19:32.070
Oh, the police car, yeah.

19:32.137 --> 19:35.474
Um, yeah. He was just
dropping me off.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.410
Yeah. From?

19:42.000 --> 19:42.614
I just popped out
to get some snacks.

19:43.248 --> 19:46.151
Lauren, you went
to the snake dungeon

19:48.000 --> 19:48.020
with Sir Greg,
didn't you?

19:48.086 --> 19:49.454
How did you know?

19:49.521 --> 19:50.956
I've met his type before.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.225
He's actually really charming.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.561
Yeah and rather kinky,
I would imagine.

19:55.627 --> 19:57.195
Sometimes it's better
to double check

19:57.262 --> 19:59.965
these little peccadilloes
beforehand, you know,

20:00.032 --> 20:02.000
save any surprises.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.468
There was an alarm, actually.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.472
What, in the dungeon?
Seems a bit extreme.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.946
Are you all right, Floss?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.519
Well, I just had sex with a
stranger in a snake dungeon.

20:20.586 --> 20:23.488
So, I don't know.

20:24.923 --> 20:29.194
You're just processing.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.229
That's a nice way to put it.

20:31.830 --> 20:35.567
Well, you are in
uncharted territory.

20:36.168 --> 20:40.505
-You, Jake, Nancy.
-Yeah.

20:42.000 --> 20:42.641
I mean, it must be very odd.

20:42.708 --> 20:46.278
It is odd.
But just because it's odd,

20:48.000 --> 20:48.146
doesn't mean it's not right.

20:50.449 --> 20:53.619
You'll be okay.
Floss, you were always okay.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.054
Thanks, Mum.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.525
[gentle music]

21:06.000 --> 21:08.266
There was no award ceremony,
was there?

21:12.000 --> 21:12.371
I tried to go to a sex party.
Okay, yes.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.505
A sex party?

21:13.572 --> 21:14.940
Yes, Mum. A sex party.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.175
You mean we've been running
all day to get you to an orgy.

21:18.000 --> 21:18.043
[laughing]

21:18.343 --> 21:20.012
Yeah, an orgy, yeah.
'Cause that's they way I roll,

21:20.078 --> 21:23.015
and you can laugh but that's,
that's what I do.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.249
No that's fine.
I'm not judging.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.218
-It's my right to do that.
-It is darling.

21:26.284 --> 21:29.454
That's what I'm doing
with my spare time.

21:30.000 --> 21:30.889
I'm going to bed Mum.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.190
Oh darling.

21:32.257 --> 21:33.191
[door squeaks]

21:33.258 --> 21:35.327
[Carol] Shush.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.530
God.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.535
[Roger snores]

21:48.000 --> 21:48.640
[phone chimes]

22:00.052 --> 22:02.754
[phone continues ringing]

22:06.191 --> 22:07.959
[python hisses]

22:08.026 --> 22:09.995
[Matt on phone] Loz, hey!
Quick thing. Coffee stain?

22:10.062 --> 22:11.897
[Lauren screams]

22:12.000 --> 22:12.431
[Matt on phone] Loz?!
