00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:06.107 --> 00:09.341
¶¶

00:09.343 --> 00:12.378
<i> ¶ I was a girl in the village</i>
<i> doing alright ¶</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.780
<i> ¶ Then I became</i>
<i> a princess overnight ¶</i>

00:14.782 --> 00:17.516
<i> ¶ Now I gotta figure out</i>
<i> how to do it right ¶</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:19.385
<i> ¶ So much to learn and see ¶</i>

00:19.387 --> 00:22.454
<i> ¶ Up in the castle</i>
<i> with my new family ¶</i>

00:22.456 --> 00:25.157
<i> ¶ In a school</i>
<i> that's just for royalty ¶</i>

00:25.159 --> 00:29.528
<i> ¶ A whole enchanted world</i>
<i> is waiting for me ¶</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:32.965
<i> ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶</i>
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:32.967 --> 00:36.001
<i> ¶ I'm finding out</i>
<i> what being royal's all about ¶</i>

00:36.003 --> 00:38.037
<i> ¶ Sofia the first ¶</i>

00:38.039 --> 00:41.507
<i> ¶ Making my way</i>
<i> it's an adventure everyday ¶</i>

00:41.509 --> 00:44.543
<i> ¶ Sofia ¶</i>
<i> ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶</i>

00:44.545 --> 00:51.450
<i> ¶ Sofia ¶</i>
<i> ¶ To show them all that</i>
<i> I am Sofia the First! ¶</i>

00:58.592 --> 01:00.959
SOFIA:<i> "The Crown of Blossoms."</i>

01:04.532 --> 01:07.332
There.
Your new garden
is all planted.

01:07.334 --> 01:10.235
Snacks any time I want 'em!

01:10.237 --> 01:12.004
Thanks for this, Sof,
you're the best.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.706
It's a great way to celebrate
the Festival of Plenty.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.775
That's what I'm talking about!

01:16.777 --> 01:19.111
Okay. Now... where are they?
Where are what?

01:19.113 --> 01:21.613
You know, the fruits,
the veggies, the yummy yummies.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.416
It's been minutes
since we planted the seeds.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.551
Clover...

01:25.553 --> 01:27.052
Gardens don't grow right away.

01:27.054 --> 01:28.554
It takes a few weeks.

01:28.556 --> 01:31.023
Ooh! Here comes
the Crown of Blossoms!

01:31.025 --> 01:34.026
Ooh! The Crown of Blossoms!
What is that?

01:34.028 --> 01:37.763
The Crown of Blossoms
is why we have the Festival
of Plenty in the first place.

01:37.765 --> 01:41.066
The Princess of Plenty,
who is always Amber,

01:41.068 --> 01:42.534
wears it for
the opening ceremony.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.236
It's a big honor

01:44.238 --> 01:46.105
because the crown isn't
just pretty, it's magic.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.307
Magic?

01:48.309 --> 01:51.810
Wow! I've never seen
the Crown of Blossoms
up close like this.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.579
It's so beautiful...

01:53.581 --> 01:55.581
Oh, I'm glad you like it
because...

01:55.583 --> 01:57.616
I told Daddy
I thought you should be

01:57.618 --> 01:59.485
this year's
Princess of Plenty.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.120
Me?

02:01.122 --> 02:02.921
Actually, it was Dad's idea.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.324
Which I loved immediately

02:05.326 --> 02:07.759
because it's about time
you had a turn. ( sighs )

02:07.761 --> 02:10.596
Which is ( sighs )
what Dad said.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.264
Ah! I don't believe this!

02:12.266 --> 02:14.500
I mean, I'd love to, but...

02:14.502 --> 02:16.068
You'll do fine.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.736
Especially if I coach you.

02:17.738 --> 02:18.804
James, crown.

02:21.108 --> 02:24.476
( gasp ) This is amazing.
Thank you!

02:24.478 --> 02:26.678
I'll go get my coaching whistle
and meet you at the stage.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.313
Uh, what?

02:28.315 --> 02:31.316
Being Princess of Plenty
is a big responsibility.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.519
Someone has to tell you
what to do.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.788
And you know Amber loves
to tell people what to do.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.658
Congratulations, Sofia.
You'll do great.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.927
( gasp ) Thanks!
Did you hear that?

02:41.929 --> 02:43.962
I'm the Princess of Plenty
this year!

02:43.964 --> 02:45.764
Oh, That's fantastic, Sof.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.533
Yay! So...

02:47.535 --> 02:51.637
tell me more about
this magic crown
you get to wear.

02:51.639 --> 02:55.340
My dad's grandma
found it a long time ago
in a far-off kingdom.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.776
It was just lying
in a big strawberry patch.

02:57.778 --> 02:58.977
No one knows who made it.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.646
But what about
the magic part?

03:00.648 --> 03:04.183
Right, so when my great-grandma
planted a seed from the Crown,

03:04.185 --> 03:06.685
all of the crops
grew better, faster

03:06.687 --> 03:09.154
and they tasted extra delicious!

03:09.156 --> 03:12.724
And now each year
the Princess of Plenty--
this year, it's me--

03:12.726 --> 03:15.794
drops a seed in one
of the fields to start
the planting season,

03:15.796 --> 03:18.697
and remind us to be thankful
for all we have.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.132
Then we have a big party.

03:20.134 --> 03:23.735
Mmm... If just one seed
could do all that,

03:23.737 --> 03:27.206
imagine what two seeds
could do.

03:27.208 --> 03:30.409
I don't know.
But they're supposed
to be super powerful.

03:30.411 --> 03:34.913
So, uh, maybe you could
hook a bunny up with one
of those magic seeds?

03:34.915 --> 03:37.749
You know, to give my garden
a better-faster-delicious boost?

03:37.751 --> 03:38.750
( chatters in support )

03:38.752 --> 03:40.652
I'd love to, but...

03:40.654 --> 03:42.821
they're not
my seeds to give, Clover.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.822
I'm sorry.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.390
I better go meet Amber.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.059
This is going to be so much fun!

03:49.730 --> 03:51.830
( chatters )
Sofia!

03:51.832 --> 03:52.598
Yes?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.932
Just, uh...

03:53.934 --> 03:55.734
good luck tonight!
( chatters )

03:55.736 --> 03:57.936
Thanks! See you later.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.705
( chatters )
I know, I know.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.573
I should give
these back to Sofia,

04:01.575 --> 04:04.009
I mean, she did just say
I couldn't have any.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.510
( chatters )

04:05.512 --> 04:08.547
But she didn't really
give them to me,

04:08.549 --> 04:10.716
they fell off and I
happened to catch them.

04:10.718 --> 04:11.917
( chatters )

04:11.919 --> 04:13.852
¶¶

04:13.854 --> 04:15.754
What to do, what to do...

04:15.756 --> 04:18.457
¶ Give it back now?
Do I give it back now? ¶

04:18.459 --> 04:20.058
( chatters )

04:20.060 --> 04:22.227
¶ On the one hand, buddy ¶

04:22.229 --> 04:24.396
¶ What's right
is plain to see ¶

04:24.398 --> 04:26.064
¶ Can't plant these tiny seeds ¶

04:26.066 --> 04:28.400
¶ They're not my property ¶

04:28.402 --> 04:30.402
¶ But on the other hand ¶

04:30.404 --> 04:32.804
¶ I did not steal at all ¶

04:32.806 --> 04:34.640
¶ The seeds dropped
from the sky ¶

04:34.642 --> 04:37.609
¶ And I just broke the fall ¶

04:37.611 --> 04:40.712
¶ The hardest thing
to figure out ¶

04:40.714 --> 04:43.215
¶ The problem I just
can't get through ¶

04:43.217 --> 04:45.083
¶ What if the thing
that you call right ¶

04:45.085 --> 04:47.419
¶ Is just the wrong
right thing to do ? ¶

04:47.421 --> 04:50.922
¶ Just the wrong
right thing to do? ¶

04:50.924 --> 04:53.659
( chatters )

04:53.661 --> 04:55.661
¶ Think it out now ¶

04:55.663 --> 04:57.963
Okay, okay,
what now, this...
( chatters )

04:57.965 --> 05:00.098
¶ Think about the veggies ¶

05:00.100 --> 05:02.301
¶ Stacked straight up
to the sky ¶

05:02.303 --> 05:06.471
¶ Lettuce, kale and carrots
are the apple of my eye ¶

05:06.473 --> 05:08.807
¶ These seeds just waste away ¶

05:08.809 --> 05:10.776
¶ Up in that blossom crown ¶

05:10.778 --> 05:14.913
¶ Why don't I move 'em
right on down to garden town? ¶

05:14.915 --> 05:16.782
¶ Huh! Well ¶

05:16.784 --> 05:18.684
¶ So let's just take
a little time ¶

05:18.686 --> 05:20.986
¶ And look at
this thing more logically ¶

05:20.988 --> 05:22.988
¶ It could be
what's wrong to you ¶

05:22.990 --> 05:25.290
¶ Is just the right
wrong thing for me ¶

05:25.292 --> 05:28.093
¶ Just the right
wrong thing for me ¶

05:28.095 --> 05:30.262
( chattering )

05:30.264 --> 05:31.863
Come on, come on!

05:31.865 --> 05:33.265
¶ You can stop
your little dance ¶

05:33.267 --> 05:34.866
¶ I know ya think
I shoulda told her ¶

05:34.868 --> 05:36.702
¶ But they say the truth
is in the eye of the beholder ¶

05:36.704 --> 05:38.270
¶ Now I gotta make
a choice ¶

05:38.272 --> 05:40.138
¶ Not just stand here
getting older ¶

05:40.140 --> 05:44.042
¶ 'Cause this golden opportunity
won't get much golder ¶

05:44.044 --> 05:48.947
¶ So this bunny's gonna step
it up and be a little bolder ¶

05:48.949 --> 05:50.882
( chattering )

06:01.362 --> 06:03.028
Leapin' lettuce!

06:03.030 --> 06:06.665
This is the best carrot
I've ever had! Ever!

06:06.667 --> 06:10.202
( gasp ) The seeds
really do create
the best tasting veggies ever.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.804
¶ Ever! ¶

06:12.806 --> 06:13.972
Oh!

06:13.974 --> 06:15.974
¶ This right here, my man ¶

06:15.976 --> 06:17.743
¶ Oh, it's the right
wrong thing to do ¶

06:17.745 --> 06:20.011
( laughs ) Gotta say it!

06:20.013 --> 06:22.748
¶ It's the right
wrong thing to do ¶

06:22.750 --> 06:28.754
( humming )

06:28.756 --> 06:30.822
( chattering )

06:30.824 --> 06:33.325
¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah! ¶

06:33.327 --> 06:35.160
( laughs ) Mmm.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.762
Have a radish, pal.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.397
You won't believe
how good they are!

06:40.734 --> 06:41.733
( chatters )

06:41.735 --> 06:42.734
Right?

06:42.736 --> 06:44.336
Hey, let's try the celery!

06:44.338 --> 06:47.839
It's-- Oh, wait,
but don't tell Sofia, okay?

06:47.841 --> 06:49.841
All right.
( chatters )

06:52.613 --> 06:55.680
( sniffs )

06:55.682 --> 06:58.016
Bouncin' blueberries! I knew it.

06:58.018 --> 07:01.052
I knew I smelled
magic vegetables!

07:01.054 --> 07:03.021
Malachite! Come here!

07:03.023 --> 07:05.924
( groans ) Are you
smellin' things again, lad?

07:05.926 --> 07:10.295
Look. That's a garden
made with seeds from
the Crown of the Gnomes!

07:10.297 --> 07:11.897
( sniffs ) Mmm.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.433
They do smell like
magic vegetables.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.902
Ooh! ( sniffs )
And there's magic pollen.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.204
Oh! Jiminy-jackfruit!
You're right.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.872
Well done, Fig.

07:20.874 --> 07:21.907
There's no doubt.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.543
That garden was
grown by a seed from...

07:24.545 --> 07:27.112
the Crown Of the Gnomes.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.882
Taken from
our strawberry patch
so long ago.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.652
Can it be that
our endless quest
is at an end?

07:33.654 --> 07:35.420
Ugh, can we finally say goodbye

07:35.422 --> 07:37.956
to tiny tomatoes
and squishy squash?

07:37.958 --> 07:39.925
Perhaps.
But for that to happen

07:39.927 --> 07:43.895
we must bring
the Crown home
to the gnomes.

07:43.897 --> 07:47.432
MALACHITE:
Ah-ha! That rabbit
must have the Crown.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.401
So we must get it from him.

07:49.403 --> 07:53.472
Let's go introduce ourselves
to that rabbit.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.841
All right, Sophia,
first thing in the ceremony,

07:55.843 --> 07:57.075
the Princess of Plenty

07:57.077 --> 07:59.077
must curtsy
and greet the audience.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.613
I've seen this Festival
before, Amber.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.882
I remember
pretty much everything.

08:03.884 --> 08:04.950
( blows whistle harshly )

08:04.952 --> 08:05.951
Maybe you should take notes?

08:05.953 --> 08:08.186
Oh...kay.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.923
Curtsy. And greet. Got it.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.158
Then you come over here.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.694
Step into the field,
take a seed from the Crown,

08:15.696 --> 08:18.096
drop it and say "I plant this--"

08:18.098 --> 08:19.865
"I plant this seed in the hope
there will always be plenty"?

08:19.867 --> 08:21.166
( blows whistle harshly )

08:21.168 --> 08:23.969
Oh, so close!
It's "plenty for all."

08:23.971 --> 08:26.972
Huh. "For all."
Thank you.

08:26.974 --> 08:27.973
( blows whistle harshly )

08:27.975 --> 08:31.710
Stop! ( groan )
The Crown is crooked.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.812
Hey, what's this design
in here?

08:33.814 --> 08:36.114
Really, Sofia, I have no idea.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.983
That's not what
I'm here to teach you.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.085
Focus!
( blows whistle harshly )

08:43.790 --> 08:45.790
Yo, this is all that's left?

08:45.792 --> 08:47.058
I can't believe
I'm running out
of veggies already!

08:47.060 --> 08:49.127
Ah, ah, hold it!

08:49.129 --> 08:52.230
Put the radish down.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.331
( chatters )

08:53.333 --> 08:55.300
Don't you ( chatters ) me!

08:55.302 --> 08:57.068
You had lots already!

08:57.070 --> 09:00.138
I don't wanna have to put
a fence around these veggies.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.740
ROBIN:
What's going on, Clover?

09:01.742 --> 09:04.009
MIA: Oh, nice garden!

09:04.011 --> 09:05.644
Sorry.
Don't have enough to share.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.412
Nothing to see here.
Move along.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.047
Huh. Rude.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.148
Double rude.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.918
Huh. Didn't notice
that before.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.023
Wait a minute.

09:18.025 --> 09:21.760
Who are you?
And why are you in my garden?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.929
Good day, sir,
I'm Malachite,

09:23.931 --> 09:26.865
the hungry one
over here is Fig.
Hello!

09:26.867 --> 09:29.868
We are lovers of fine fruits
and veggies, and these...

09:29.870 --> 09:32.037
are spectacular.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.838
This garden
wasn't by any chance

09:33.840 --> 09:36.575
grown with
magical seeds, was it?

09:36.577 --> 09:38.176
Magical seeds? What? No!

09:38.178 --> 09:40.946
Magical seeds?
I planted this garden.
I have a green paw.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.748
I don't have any magical seeds.
No, never heard of it.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.749
Shame.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.051
Aye, 'tis.

09:46.053 --> 09:49.554
Your tasty veggies
won't last long, my friend.

09:49.556 --> 09:52.023
You've eaten at least
half of them already.

09:52.025 --> 09:56.561
Soon these rare, mouth-watering
veggies will be gone.

09:56.563 --> 09:59.197
That's true. Oh, man.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.232
You know,
we could help you with that.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.768
How would you
like us to make it
so your garden's supply

10:03.770 --> 10:06.104
of delicious veggies
never ever runs out?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.139
You can do that?

10:08.141 --> 10:10.041
You heard of
the Hanging Gardens of Galdiz?

10:10.043 --> 10:12.043
The Tangu Tomato Terraces?

10:12.045 --> 10:13.311
You guys planted those?

10:13.313 --> 10:16.548
Uh, no, but we enchanted them.

10:16.550 --> 10:19.150
And we can enchant
your garden too.

10:19.152 --> 10:23.088
We just need
one little magic seed.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.155
Just one?

10:24.157 --> 10:25.991
That's right. We enchant it,

10:25.993 --> 10:28.126
you plant it,
and quick as a wink,

10:28.128 --> 10:32.297
you get never-ending,
incredibly delicious
fruits and veggies.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.833
Oh, never-ending
fruits and veggies.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.435
Can we do that?
I'm very confused.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.404
Shh, of course not, lad,

10:39.406 --> 10:42.974
I'm tricking the rabbit
so we get the Crown back.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.609
Oh, aye.

10:44.611 --> 10:48.513
Bu you don't have
a magic seed for us to enchant,

10:48.515 --> 10:50.081
so we can't help you.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.350
And you, running out
of delicious, magical,

10:52.352 --> 10:56.321
impossible-to-replace veggies...
so sad.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.790
Wait! What if I told you
I could get a magic seed?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.125
Well, borrow one, anyway.

11:00.127 --> 11:03.161
Would you still do that
garden enchanting thing for me?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.697
It would be our pleasure.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.932
Excellent!
I'll get it. You stay here.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.635
Right. We'll just have
a tiny nibble while we wait.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.103
Uh-uh-uh.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.638
On second thought,

11:13.640 --> 11:15.106
you guys come with me.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.842
( blows whistle harshly )

11:17.844 --> 11:19.644
( sighs ) Curtsy, greet,
walk, say the words,

11:19.646 --> 11:21.146
drop the seed,
don't fall in dirt.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.147
See? I've got this!

11:22.149 --> 11:23.148
( blows whistle harshly )

11:23.150 --> 11:24.649
What? What did I forget?

11:24.651 --> 11:27.619
Nothing. But...
The gown's on backwards.

11:27.621 --> 11:28.920
Oops.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.361
( gasps )

11:36.363 --> 11:38.863
BOTH: The Crown of the Gnomes!

11:42.302 --> 11:43.301
What's going on?

11:43.303 --> 11:44.302
Hey, put that back!

11:44.304 --> 11:46.304
We're taking the Crown, rabbit.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.807
You can't! Sofia needs it
for the Festival.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.175
But it's ours.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.242
Did you hear that?

11:51.244 --> 11:52.477
Hear what?

11:52.479 --> 11:54.079
I'm going to check.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.120
Hmm.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.861
You are not leaving
with that crown!

12:09.863 --> 12:11.162
MALACHITE: Oh, yes, we are.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.532
( both laughing )

12:14.534 --> 12:16.768
( grunts )
Is this right?

12:16.770 --> 12:20.171
Oh, yes. But it's almost time
for the Festival to start.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.073
So, let's see what it
looks like with the Crown.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.110
Um, Amber,
I appreciate your help,

12:25.112 --> 12:27.412
but please don't
blow the whistle again.

12:28.582 --> 12:33.017
( muffled frustration )

12:33.019 --> 12:35.954
( giggles ) Clover?
What are you doing?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.589
Sofia. What brings you here?

12:37.591 --> 12:40.458
Have you seen
the Crown of Blossoms?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.127
It was right here.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.728
Crown? Crown? Crown?

12:43.730 --> 12:46.698
Mm, uh, gotta run, bye!

12:46.700 --> 12:47.899
How does it look
with the crown?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.868
I can't find it!

12:49.870 --> 12:52.137
It was here, but now it's gone.

12:52.139 --> 12:55.473
Oh, don't be silly!
It's right here on the--

12:55.475 --> 12:56.474
Where's the crown?!

12:56.476 --> 12:58.276
Gone! Like I said!

12:58.278 --> 13:01.579
Oh, this is no time
for jokes, Sofia.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.947
It's not a joke, Amber!

13:04.384 --> 13:07.318
Oh, oh, it is gone!

13:07.320 --> 13:08.620
Alert the guards!

13:08.622 --> 13:10.955
No, then everyone
will find out.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.757
It's my first time
being Princess of Plenty,

13:12.759 --> 13:14.225
and I've already messed it up.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.227
Can you just help me
get it back, Amber?

13:16.229 --> 13:19.130
How? I don't know anything
about finding crown thieves!

13:19.132 --> 13:21.399
How can you be
Princess of Plenty
without the Crown of Blossoms?

13:21.401 --> 13:22.567
What will happen
to the Festival?

13:22.569 --> 13:24.169
( blows whistle harshly )

13:24.171 --> 13:27.238
Okay. I'm better now.
Thank you for that.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.941
( sigh ) Of course
I'll help you.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.576
What if I stall
the start of the Festival,

13:31.578 --> 13:33.077
and you get the Crown back?

13:33.079 --> 13:35.413
Sounds like a plan.
Thanks, Amber.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.015
( door slams shut )

13:37.017 --> 13:38.516
Clover?

13:38.518 --> 13:40.618
Do you know
anything about this?

13:40.620 --> 13:42.954
Well, uh, I, uh...

13:42.956 --> 13:45.156
Well, I, uh...

13:47.160 --> 13:49.828
How did your garden grow
so many veggies so fast?

13:49.830 --> 13:51.329
It's almost like...

13:51.331 --> 13:52.497
Magic.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.432
It's a really
funny story, really.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.034
Not funny like "ha ha."

13:56.036 --> 13:59.337
Clover, I know
you know something. Tell me!

13:59.339 --> 14:02.440
Well, see, some seeds
fell out of your Crown.

14:02.442 --> 14:06.110
I thought, what harm
could there be in using them
for my little garden?

14:06.112 --> 14:07.212
And it worked!

14:07.214 --> 14:09.681
One seed did all this?

14:09.683 --> 14:12.317
Well, it was more like three.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.219
Clover!
I know.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.120
So then these gnomes
showed up and they told me

14:16.122 --> 14:17.222
they'd make my garden grow
never-ending delicious veggies,

14:17.224 --> 14:19.324
but instead
they stole the Crown.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.859
So really it's their fault
when you think about it and--

14:20.861 --> 14:22.360
Okay, okay!

14:22.362 --> 14:23.461
( inhales ) It was my fault.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.230
I lied to you.

14:25.232 --> 14:28.399
I stole the seeds
and I let the gnomes
steal the Crown.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.301
I let you down, Soph.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.337
Not just me, Clover.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.807
The Crown of Blossoms
is important to everyone.

14:35.809 --> 14:38.376
( sighs )
Where did those gnomes go?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.944
Um, that way.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.318
( sniffing ) Ooh!

14:49.489 --> 14:51.356
Toys, toys, toys!

14:51.358 --> 14:52.690
( howls )

14:52.692 --> 14:53.725
Hello, toys!

14:53.727 --> 14:55.326
( sniffs )

14:55.328 --> 14:56.327
Boo!

14:56.329 --> 14:58.696
( howls in fear )

14:58.698 --> 15:00.198
( cackling )

15:00.200 --> 15:01.499
Eh, nice one!

15:01.501 --> 15:03.501
MIA:
Gnomes? What gnomes?

15:03.503 --> 15:06.571
ROBIN: We haven't seen anything
since a certain rude bunny

15:06.573 --> 15:08.773
wouldn't share
his garden veggies with us.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.275
Sorry about that.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.276
You should be.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.278
I really need
your help finding them.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.880
They are somewhere in the castle
or on the grounds.

15:15.882 --> 15:18.883
ROBIN: Sure, Sofia.
MIA: We're on it!

15:18.885 --> 15:20.084
( chatters )

15:20.086 --> 15:21.286
I-I can help, too.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.521
No, thanks.
You've helped enough.

15:23.523 --> 15:24.822
( sighs )

15:26.760 --> 15:29.294
Before the Princess
of Plenty appears,

15:29.296 --> 15:32.263
Prince James and I would like
to present to you

15:32.265 --> 15:36.367
the amazing, uh,
"Dance of the Saplings."

15:36.369 --> 15:38.303
A little dancing music, maestro.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.973
¶¶

15:48.782 --> 15:51.215
Just do what I do.
It's for Sofia!

15:56.323 --> 15:57.989
There's the way out!

15:57.991 --> 16:00.158
( chattering )

16:00.160 --> 16:03.761
Aww. Isn't he
a cute little critter?

16:03.763 --> 16:05.330
Oh! I take it back!

16:07.467 --> 16:08.733
( muffled chattering )

16:08.735 --> 16:11.336
What did one ocean
say to the other?

16:11.338 --> 16:15.273
Nothing. They just waved!
( chuckles ) Ah. Get it?

16:15.275 --> 16:17.275
We can't keep this up
much longer.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.510
Where is Sofia?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.847
( chirping )

16:22.849 --> 16:24.449
Did they come out this way?

16:24.451 --> 16:25.850
Nope. Not this way.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.452
And they didn't
cross the bridge.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.288
Good. That means
they're still here somewhere.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.356
We need a plan B.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.291
( chattering )
Whatnaught!

16:33.293 --> 16:34.492
He saw the gnomes!

16:34.494 --> 16:35.827
That's one of their hats!

16:35.829 --> 16:37.428
Clover, what are you doing?

16:37.430 --> 16:40.465
This is all the veggies
I have left from my garden.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.033
Gnomes can't resist 'em,

16:42.035 --> 16:45.036
and I know how we can use 'em
to get the Crown back...

16:45.038 --> 16:46.437
If you'll let me help.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.440
( sighs ) Okay.
What's your plan?

16:49.442 --> 16:51.809
See, I figure they have
to cross the bridge

16:51.811 --> 16:53.177
to get out of here, right?

16:53.179 --> 16:55.580
So if we place
a few tomatoes there...

16:57.050 --> 16:58.783
All we gotta do
is get across this bridge

16:58.785 --> 17:00.184
and we're home free!

17:00.186 --> 17:01.719
Great! Let's do it!

17:03.156 --> 17:04.389
Ooh. ( sniffs ) What's that?

17:04.391 --> 17:06.958
( sniffing )

17:09.129 --> 17:11.796
Oh, marvelous! And magical!

17:13.299 --> 17:14.632
Oh, that is nice.
( sniffing )

17:14.634 --> 17:17.402
Look, Malachite! Another one!

17:17.404 --> 17:20.304
Careful, lad.
Something's fishy.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.407
Fishy? More like yummy!

17:24.811 --> 17:27.512
Oh, wait. There's more.
Much more.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.480
Fig? Hold up now, laddie!

17:29.482 --> 17:33.217
Creamed cauliflower!
We've hit the jackpot!

17:33.219 --> 17:35.420
Wait, lad. This could be a trap.

17:35.422 --> 17:38.423
Look at these juicy,
red tomatoes!

17:38.425 --> 17:39.891
Pull yourself together, man!

17:39.893 --> 17:41.492
There's no time to snack!

17:41.494 --> 17:44.362
Ooh! But it looks so good.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.998
( sniffing )
And it smells even better!

17:47.000 --> 17:49.067
Oh, I can't help myself!

17:49.069 --> 17:50.501
Now!

17:51.504 --> 17:53.905
( screaming in fear )

17:57.544 --> 17:58.609
Got it!

17:59.579 --> 18:01.446
Hello, gnomes.

18:01.448 --> 18:04.015
Hello, rabbit.

18:04.017 --> 18:05.783
That was quite the trap.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.087
But I believe you have
something that belongs to us.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.457
That Crown belongs to Sofia
and her family.

18:12.459 --> 18:16.094
That's right. And now I have
to get it to the Festival!

18:16.096 --> 18:18.229
Well, before you go, Princess,

18:18.231 --> 18:20.465
just know it's not
the Crown of Blossoms
you're wearing.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.400
It's the Crown of the Gnomes,

18:22.402 --> 18:25.570
taken from our
strawberry patch
many years ago.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.705
That's not how
I heard the story.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.974
Well, give a listen, dear ones,

18:29.976 --> 18:33.411
and I'll tell you
the true tale of the Crown.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.079
( clears throat )

18:35.081 --> 18:37.582
A gnome loves a sad story.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.583
¶¶

18:38.585 --> 18:39.984
The Crown of the Gnomes

18:39.986 --> 18:42.420
'twas the pride of our people
for many a year,

18:42.422 --> 18:45.089
our fields were filled with
fruits and vegetables.

18:45.091 --> 18:47.492
We don't have good land
like you do here.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.495
FIG: We need the Crown
to make our crops grow well.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.131
On that fateful day so long ago,

18:53.133 --> 18:54.632
the gnome
in charge of the Crown

18:54.634 --> 18:57.301
lay down in a strawberry patch
for a nap.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.771
But when he awoke,
the Crown was gone.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.574
For years,
we've searched for it.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.444
From Rudistan to Khaldoun.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.447
MALACHITE:
But today, luck was on our side.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.816
We came to your
Festival of Plenty

19:11.818 --> 19:16.254
and found
our beloved Crown at last.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.655
Look.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.524
( gasp ) It's the same
as on their hats.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.825
( chattering )

19:20.827 --> 19:22.660
Maybe they are
telling the truth.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.162
I think they are.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.731
I guess the Crown
really does belong to them.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.601
I'm so sorry. Here.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.770
Thank you, Princess.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.772
And you, rabbit.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.775
And I hope you can
forgive us for tricking you.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.544
Ah, it's okay.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.612
You got-- Oh, Sofia!

19:41.614 --> 19:43.548
What about the Festival?

19:43.550 --> 19:46.384
( sighs ) There isn't going
to be a Festival, Clover.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.387
Some Princess of Plenty
I turned out to be.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.722
You're a plenty great
Princess Of Plenty.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.624
It's my fault.
I'm a rotten friend.

19:53.626 --> 19:57.461
You gave me a garden,
but was I thankful? No.

19:57.463 --> 20:01.566
( sighs )
I am so, so sorry.

20:01.568 --> 20:02.833
Well...

20:02.835 --> 20:04.835
If you hadn't
given up your veggies,

20:04.837 --> 20:07.171
we'd never have learned
the truth about the Crown.

20:07.173 --> 20:10.141
But how am I going to tell
everyone about this?

20:10.143 --> 20:12.410
Don't worry, I'll be
right beside you

20:12.412 --> 20:14.579
when you share
the bad news.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.582
Share...
Did you say share?

20:17.584 --> 20:19.684
Clover, you're a genius!

20:19.686 --> 20:21.018
Eh, what?

20:21.020 --> 20:23.654
There's a way
for everyone to win.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.723
Malachite? I have an idea.

20:27.660 --> 20:31.662
¶¶

20:32.665 --> 20:34.732
Oh! Oh, stop!

20:34.734 --> 20:36.767
Stop the music, please!

20:36.769 --> 20:38.769
( panting ) Finally.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.605
Oh, you couldn't
find the Crown?

20:40.607 --> 20:42.340
It's okay, Amber.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.375
Just introduce me.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.611
If you say so.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.713
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:48.715 --> 20:50.915
please welcome
to the Festival...

20:50.917 --> 20:53.117
the Princess of Plenty!

20:53.119 --> 20:54.919
( scattered applause )

20:54.921 --> 20:56.454
Good evening, everyone.

20:56.456 --> 20:59.023
Sorry I'm so late, but...

20:59.025 --> 21:01.392
it turns out there's
been a misunderstanding.

21:01.394 --> 21:05.296
You see, the Crown of Blossoms
doesn't really belong to us.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.430
What?

21:06.432 --> 21:07.632
I don't understand.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.500
Who does it belong to?

21:11.471 --> 21:14.805
The gnomes.
This is Malachite and Fig.

21:14.807 --> 21:19.076
Guys, meet my dad and mom,
King Roland and Queen Miranda.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.878
Your majesties.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.881
We haven't seen gnomes
in Enchancia for ages.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.883
You are most welcome.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.718
Why, thank you, King Roland.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.721
The gnomes lost
the Crown a long time ago.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.490
And we found it by accident.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.725
It really belongs to them.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.060
See?

21:38.231 --> 21:40.731
They could have just taken
the Crown back with them,

21:40.733 --> 21:46.170
but instead they agreed
to share it with us
once a year for our Festival.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.306
( laugh ) As long as
we can come with it.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.474
We love a good festival!

21:50.476 --> 21:53.911
Gentlemen, we are grateful
for your generosity.

21:53.913 --> 21:57.415
The gnomes will always
have a friend in Enchancia.

21:57.417 --> 22:00.685
And you will always be
welcome at the party!

22:00.687 --> 22:03.321
Well, that's great.
'Cause I'm starving.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.304
Welcome to
the Festival of Plenty!

22:20.306 --> 22:24.875
( applause and cheering )

22:29.282 --> 22:33.184
I plant this seed in the hope
there will always be plenty...

22:34.487 --> 22:35.686
for all!

22:39.826 --> 22:41.892
( cheering erupts )

23:05.685 --> 23:08.419
( theme music )
