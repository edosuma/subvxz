[sighs]

41:59.365 --> 42:00.405
It's for the best.

42:00.805 --> 42:02.245
Yeah.

42:14.925 --> 42:15.925
What are you doing here?

42:16.685 --> 42:18.205
I'm buying all this cat food.

42:18.485 --> 42:20.525
-I didn't know that you had a cat.
-I don't.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.805
I'm buying all this cat food because...

42:23.645 --> 42:25.045
I really like cats.

42:25.565 --> 42:27.285
House cats in particular.

42:27.365 --> 42:29.725
I like them way more than lions.

42:30.645 --> 42:32.045
Is this supposed to be romantic?

42:34.285 --> 42:36.485
[whispers] Yeah. It was.

42:37.165 --> 42:38.885
You're holding up the line!

42:39.925 --> 42:42.645
Sorry, I'm... I'll just be a minute.

42:42.805 --> 42:44.285
We're resolving a past wrongdoing.

42:44.685 --> 42:46.205
Yes, I can see that.

42:46.285 --> 42:47.485
It's not cute.

42:48.285 --> 42:49.125
It's annoying.

42:49.205 --> 42:50.365
We'll just be a moment.

42:50.725 --> 42:52.965
Don't you take that tone with me,
young lady.

42:53.365 --> 42:54.325
Very rude.

42:54.765 --> 42:57.805
She's not rude, okay?
She just has a very direct manner.

42:57.885 --> 43:00.925
She's rude and you're pathetic.

43:01.005 --> 43:02.605
Now who's being rude?

43:03.525 --> 43:05.085
-Ow!
-Stupid boy!

43:06.845 --> 43:08.205
-[shop bell rings]
-She hit me.

43:08.605 --> 43:12.085
That was very brave.
And also quite emasculating.

43:13.245 --> 43:16.485
Look, my shift is over in 15 minutes
and I'm gonna walk you home.

43:17.325 --> 43:19.845
[cheering and applause]

43:22.805 --> 43:25.605

Skinny, sickly-looking fella.

44:08.085 --> 44:12.485
Had some really interesting thoughts
about me and Jeffrey's marital problems.

44:13.125 --> 44:14.045
Thanks.

44:15.765 --> 44:17.925
-Have you seen my brother?
-Oh, yeah.

44:18.005 --> 44:19.525
He told me to pass somethin' on to you.

44:19.605 --> 44:24.325
He said... "Tell Maeve to stop hangin'
around with a bunch of geeks

44:24.405 --> 44:26.925
talking about astrophysics and shit."

44:27.605 --> 44:29.005
Something like that.

44:29.605 --> 44:31.445
Did he tell you where he was goin'? Or...

44:31.525 --> 44:33.805
Said 'e was doin' some shoppin',

44:34.645 --> 44:36.005
but he had a big bag with him.

44:38.365 --> 44:40.005
Okay. Thanks, Cynthia.

44:48.525 --> 44:49.925

44:59.165 --> 45:00.125
Yes!

45:03.365 --> 45:05.725
Come on, Jackson! Yes!

45:08.765 --> 45:10.165
We knew you could do it!

45:10.565 --> 45:11.525
Well done.

45:13.645 --> 45:14.645
Is she staying?

45:16.645 --> 45:17.765
I don't take bribes.

45:18.565 --> 45:21.205
I suggest you forget about Maeve Wiley.
Hm?

45:23.525 --> 45:26.565
There he is! Jackson! Well done, Jack!

45:27.405 --> 45:29.125
-Well done!
-Darling!

Something I need to tell you.

47:24.045 --> 47:26.205
There's a few things, actually.

47:26.285 --> 47:27.405
So, uh...

47:27.485 --> 47:29.565
This is my house.
[chuckles] You know that.

47:29.965 --> 47:30.805
Um...

47:31.365 --> 47:32.925
Eh... I'm an odd person.

47:33.325 --> 47:36.765
What I mean is, I'm unusual,
and if you wanna be with me, then...

47:36.885 --> 47:38.605
I mean, not like my girlfriend...

47:38.685 --> 47:42.285
That's... that's too fast. I know.
Eh... No pressure. Just...

47:42.365 --> 47:44.525
If you wanted to be, like,
a significant other, then...

47:44.605 --> 47:47.405
Wow. That sounds like marriage.
I don't wanna get married.

47:47.485 --> 47:49.685
I mean, maybe one day,
with the right person.

47:49.765 --> 47:51.965
Which could be you.
But not in a weird way. Okay.

47:52.285 --> 47:54.365
I can't breathe. [sighs]

47:54.925 --> 47:56.005
Eh...

47:56.725 --> 47:58.365
[whispers] Okay.

47:58.765 --> 48:00.085
What I'm trying to say is...

48:00.765 --> 48:05.125
I'm just new to all this
and I need to take things slowly.
