WEBVTT

00:10.460 --> 00:14.530
'Tonight - the new Porsche
Cayman on our track.'

00:14.580 --> 00:18.050
'The Ferrari, the Ferrari at
the limit in Italy, Italy.'

00:18.100 --> 00:20.970
'And an old Peugeot
goes past some goats.'

00:28.540 --> 00:29.930
Hello!

00:29.980 --> 00:34.410
Hello, good evening, thank you
so much, everybody, thank you!

00:34.460 --> 00:36.050
Thanks very much, everyone.

00:36.100 --> 00:42.330
Now, every few years Chevrolet
introduces a new Corvette,

00:42.380 --> 00:46.970
and they always say this is the
best sports car in America.

00:47.020 --> 00:49.330
And you go, yes, in the same way that

00:49.380 --> 00:52.290
I'm the best-dressed
presenter on Top Gear.

00:52.340 --> 00:55.010
Which, actually, as you'll
see later on, I am.

00:55.060 --> 00:59.250
Anyway, the truth is no Corvette
has ever been a match for

00:59.300 --> 01:01.170
the best that Europe can do.

01:01.220 --> 01:04.610
And it looks like it's much
the same story with this,

01:04.660 --> 01:06.370
the latest model.

01:06.420 --> 01:07.610
But is it?

01:07.660 --> 01:10.740
Well, Richard Hammond
has been finding out.

01:18.940 --> 01:22.540
'To me, Corvettes have
always looked great.

01:24.820 --> 01:28.210
'And for this one, the
seventh generation,

01:28.260 --> 01:31.260
'they really have pulled
out all the stops.'

01:34.540 --> 01:36.730
Ohhh!

01:36.780 --> 01:38.410
Oh, yah.

01:38.460 --> 01:40.090
Ohhhh!

01:40.140 --> 01:42.810
Oh, no. Gets worse.

01:42.860 --> 01:44.410
They've even brought back

01:44.460 --> 01:47.540
the Stingray badge from the
classic Corvettes of the '60s.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.880
I'd say that was job done.

01:51.180 --> 01:53.980
'Except it isn't, because
there's more.'

01:58.260 --> 01:59.970
We have a 6.2 litre V8,

02:00.020 --> 02:03.210
460 horsepower and the
same number in torque,

02:03.260 --> 02:06.450
which means in any
gear, at any speed,

02:06.500 --> 02:08.639
you put your foot down...

02:09.060 --> 02:11.000
.. and stuff happens!

02:17.740 --> 02:19.540
There's the noise!

02:22.540 --> 02:25.010
There's the shove in the back.

02:25.060 --> 02:29.050
'0-60 is all over in
less than four seconds.

02:29.100 --> 02:31.770
'Top speed - 190.'

02:34.620 --> 02:37.490
Why do the oaf and the bore
not get what's going on here?

02:37.540 --> 02:42.210
I mean, James May likes a car
that makes his fizzy bit fizz.

02:42.260 --> 02:45.060
This'd put a SodaStream
in his grundies.

02:48.140 --> 02:51.130
'The Vette costs £65,000,

02:51.180 --> 02:53.450
'which might sound like a lot

02:53.500 --> 02:57.420
'until you compare it to its rivals
from this side of the pond.'

02:59.420 --> 03:03.090
To get a Jaguar F Type V8,
you'll need another 20,000.

03:03.140 --> 03:06.130
An Audi R8 V8, another 30,000.

03:06.180 --> 03:10.050
A 911 V8, well, you can't.
There's no such thing.

03:10.100 --> 03:13.250
But to get close to the
same power in a 911

03:13.300 --> 03:15.610
you'll need another £25,000.

03:15.660 --> 03:18.370
In fact, if you're looking
for a European sports car

03:18.420 --> 03:19.770
for the same money,

03:19.820 --> 03:21.820
you're looking at this.

03:25.660 --> 03:30.850
'It's the latest version
of the 911's baby brother,

03:30.900 --> 03:33.820
'the Porsche Cayman GTS.'

03:39.060 --> 03:42.210
But here's the thing - even
though the Cayman costs

03:42.260 --> 03:45.410
about the same as the Corvette,
when it comes to power difference,

03:45.460 --> 03:49.810
the gulf between them is wide
enough to swallow a supertanker.

03:49.860 --> 03:52.290
An American supertanker.

03:52.340 --> 03:57.250
This has 336 brake horsepower,
compared to the Corvette's 460.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.980
And this has 185 fewer torques.

04:02.500 --> 04:07.140
'All of which means it's absolutely
pointless having a drag race.'

04:08.460 --> 04:12.380
We're going to do it anyway because
we are intelligent and thorough.

04:13.540 --> 04:16.779
Three, two, one, go!

04:24.460 --> 04:25.890
'And there we are.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.540
'As I said, absolutely pointless.'

04:31.500 --> 04:32.930
But here's the thing.

04:32.980 --> 04:39.420
In its own right, the Cayman GTS is
a small but magnificent little thing.

04:43.020 --> 04:45.160
Pitch-perfect engineering.

04:45.820 --> 04:47.560
Total precision.

04:51.100 --> 04:55.330
It just feels lithe, nimble,
compact, all those words,

04:55.380 --> 04:58.890
balance, poise,
predictability, tractability,

04:58.940 --> 05:02.380
all those good, lovely, yummy
things. It's got them all.

05:04.860 --> 05:09.540
The perfect example of exactly what
a European sports car should be.

05:11.860 --> 05:15.290
'It's a crushing demonstration
of what's possible,

05:15.340 --> 05:17.930
'what good engineering should be.

05:17.980 --> 05:20.290
'And why Europe, not America,

05:20.340 --> 05:24.580
'has always been where you
turn for proper sports cars.'

05:25.940 --> 05:27.130
So here we are -

05:27.180 --> 05:30.250
at that point in the test where,
traditionally, I'd say,

05:30.300 --> 05:34.450
"The Corvette looks brilliant,
great value, lots of fun, but..."

05:34.500 --> 05:36.770
And then I'd do a deep sigh.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.970
Sadly, in the company of the Porsche,

05:40.020 --> 05:42.560
the Corvette simply can't hack it.

05:43.220 --> 05:46.540
Then we'd play some sad music and
I'd say, "Back to the studio."

05:48.060 --> 05:52.450
'But no. This time we're not
going back to the studio.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.690
'We're going back to the Corvette,

05:54.740 --> 05:58.890
'because this is no longer
some hillbilly hot rod.

05:58.940 --> 06:02.290
'It's got suspension
made of carbon fibre.

06:02.340 --> 06:07.050
'It has seat frames crafted
from ultra-light magnesium.

06:07.100 --> 06:11.370
'It has different driving modes,
like you get in a Ferrari,

06:11.420 --> 06:15.490
'and that big shouty V8 can
shut down half its cylinders

06:15.540 --> 06:17.810
'to make it more economical.'

06:19.740 --> 06:23.700
Previous Corvette underbodies were
really not very far from that.

06:26.900 --> 06:30.010
But this is an all-new hi-tech
bonded aluminium affair that

06:30.060 --> 06:32.600
manages to be lighter and stiffer.

06:33.900 --> 06:38.890
Best of all is that it was developed
at the Nurburgring, not Nashville.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.450
'This means that the cornering is...'

06:41.500 --> 06:43.770
Well, it's a bit of an event!

06:51.780 --> 06:56.500
All this power, all this bigness,
but it's still essentially tameable.

06:59.140 --> 07:01.530
Remember when you had
a pet elephant as a kid?

07:01.580 --> 07:03.250
It's like that.

07:05.340 --> 07:08.900
It is Sweet Home Alabama, it's
cowgirls in denim shorts...

07:14.700 --> 07:17.440
Yes! It's everything
I wanted it to be!

07:18.660 --> 07:22.340
'But what it is more is a
match for the Europeans.'

07:23.940 --> 07:25.490
Let's be quite clear here.

07:25.540 --> 07:29.890
It's not like the Corvette has
lost all of its redneck charm.

07:29.940 --> 07:32.490
If the Porsche is a laboratory
full of laser beams,

07:32.540 --> 07:35.060
this is a Wild West saloon.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.210
But you don't have to apologise
for it. You don't have to say,

07:41.260 --> 07:44.970
"Well, at least it's cheap,"
or, "It's the best they can do."

07:45.020 --> 07:46.820
It simply is good.

07:48.220 --> 07:52.410
In fact, it's the best sports
car ever to come out of America,

07:52.460 --> 07:56.300
and for once, you can't follow
that up with a joke.

08:03.660 --> 08:06.650
It's a good car.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.370
It is annoying.

08:09.660 --> 08:13.690
That is annoying, because for
the second time this series,

08:13.740 --> 08:16.250
I agree with you. Actually,
the second time in my LIFE

08:16.300 --> 08:19.410
~ I agree with you.
~ Right, you're not going to
call me Billy Bob Hammond?

08:19.460 --> 08:22.170
No, and nor am I going
to mention that jacket.

08:22.220 --> 08:25.130
No, no, I know, I know you want
me to but I'm not going to.

08:25.180 --> 08:27.090
What I'm actually going
to do is ask you this.

08:27.140 --> 08:30.570
Which one of these
two would you have?

08:30.620 --> 08:32.929
Uh, you see, that's actually
really difficult

08:32.980 --> 08:34.690
cos they are both epic to drive.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.650
~ They are.
~ You can't argue with that.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.770
But, I don't know, I don't think
the Porsche looks very good.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.210
~ It looks dowdy.
~ It does, so I'd have the Corvette.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.370
The trouble is with the
Corvette, though, is

08:44.420 --> 08:46.650
you don't have to apologise
for it, as you said,

08:46.700 --> 08:49.650
but you would have to explain it.
You'd have to go around saying,

08:49.700 --> 08:52.610
"Oh, it's got magnesium seats
and carbon fibre suspension,"

08:52.660 --> 08:55.530
or everyone would just think
you were a dreadful show-off.

08:55.580 --> 08:59.530
Yeah, it would be like taking a lap
dancer home to meet your mother.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.170
You'd have to say, "No,
she's got A-Levels!"

09:02.220 --> 09:03.810
You're absolutely right.

09:03.860 --> 09:08.650
So what we've got here is a choice
between a slightly dirty librarian

09:08.700 --> 09:10.770
and a clever lap dancer.

09:12.180 --> 09:14.810
So let's see which is the
fastest round our track.

09:14.860 --> 09:19.690
Of course, that means handing them
over to our tame racing driver.

09:19.740 --> 09:23.690
Some say that his favourite
flower is the potato,

09:23.740 --> 09:28.170
and that even though he's now
seen Fifty Shades of Grey,

09:28.220 --> 09:32.490
he still thinks BDSM
is a driving school.

09:32.540 --> 09:35.140
All we know is he's called the Stig!

09:37.380 --> 09:39.770
'And they're off! Two
confident starts there.

09:39.820 --> 09:42.890
'The Porsche is mid-engine,
the Corvette has a transaxle.

09:42.940 --> 09:45.650
'Both clearly had good
traction off the line.

09:45.700 --> 09:49.660
'It's the scalpel versus the hammer,
flying through the first corner.

09:50.860 --> 09:54.060
'And, oh, wow, it's the
Porsche that's sliding!

09:59.820 --> 10:03.210
'Seems to be reversing
round in the Corvette.

10:03.260 --> 10:04.850
'Right through Chicago,

10:04.900 --> 10:07.450
'again it's the Cayman that's
kicking its tail out.

10:07.500 --> 10:11.370
'Shock and awe Chevy
completely under control!

10:11.420 --> 10:13.930
'This is the real test,
of course, Hammerhead.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.930
'Yep, Corvette gets
a bit of a slide on

10:15.980 --> 10:19.620
'as the Stig unleashes
a 460 horsepower drift!

10:22.700 --> 10:25.210
'Right, follow through.

10:25.260 --> 10:29.180
'Porsche needs some corrective lock
on the way in, that's a surprise.

10:31.020 --> 10:35.530
'OK, now we're coming up. Just
two corners left, braking hard,

10:35.580 --> 10:40.090
'no dramas from either side
of the Atlantic, into Gambon.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.170
'Yes, the Cayman's sliding
again! And across the line!'

10:45.020 --> 10:46.620
~ Right.
~ Yeah.

10:47.340 --> 10:49.340
I have the times here.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.850
The pantyless Porsche librarian -

10:52.900 --> 10:55.250
1:21.6.

10:55.300 --> 10:59.290
~ So, not bad, same as an Audi R8 V10.
~ That's quick, yeah.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.450
But...

11:01.500 --> 11:03.450
.. the clever lap dancer...

11:03.500 --> 11:05.490
~ 1:19.8.
~ No way! That's...!

11:05.540 --> 11:08.450
Look at that, same as
a Porsche Carrera GT.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.130
That is a seriously fast car.

11:10.180 --> 11:12.570
There's been a disturbance
in the Force!

11:12.620 --> 11:14.850
Something weird's happening.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.450
Anyway, the news, and
we start with this,

11:17.500 --> 11:20.210
the new Ford Focus RS.

11:20.260 --> 11:25.010
That has 320 horsepower from
a 2.3 litre turbocharged engine.

11:25.060 --> 11:28.490
And, most important,
this, four-wheel drive.

11:28.540 --> 11:30.610
You know what this is, don't you?

11:30.660 --> 11:33.850
~ Mm-mm.
~ This is the return of the Escort Cosworth.
~ Yeah.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.170
Happy days!

11:35.220 --> 11:38.850
It is, I'm excited, but it won't
be as good as a Fiesta ST.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.690
~ Well, it will.
~ No, it won't!
~ It will!

11:40.740 --> 11:42.810
~ The Fiesta's...!
~ 320 horsepowers!

11:42.860 --> 11:46.090
I know but it's about purity
of experience in a hot hatch.

11:46.140 --> 11:49.650
That comes, apparently, according
to one source in America

11:49.700 --> 11:51.690
~ with a drift button.
~ A what?

11:51.740 --> 11:54.370
Drift button, push that,
even he'll be able to drift.

11:54.420 --> 11:56.410
~ What, you push that and it just drifts?
~ Yes.

11:56.460 --> 11:57.690
I don't want to drift.

11:57.740 --> 12:01.170
~ Yes, you do!
~ I don't. Drifting is for the unintelligent.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.850
It isn't!

12:02.900 --> 12:04.930
It's a mating ritual. Girls love it!

12:04.980 --> 12:06.770
Yeah, he's right.

12:06.820 --> 12:09.890
No, it is, it's like
having a massive tail.

12:14.020 --> 12:15.290
It's just me -

12:15.340 --> 12:17.020
in Ross-on-Wye.

12:18.500 --> 12:22.810
Ooh, now, you know Apple, makers
of computers and, um, telephones?

12:22.860 --> 12:24.930
~ Yes.
~ Apparently they're working on a car.

12:24.980 --> 12:27.850
~ Really?
~ Yes.
~ Does it come with predictive steering?

12:27.900 --> 12:29.530
That's never going to work, is it?

12:29.580 --> 12:32.370
It is... No, I'm not sure that
it will work, cos every time

12:32.420 --> 12:35.090
you get in it, it will say,
"What's your iTunes password?"

12:35.140 --> 12:37.890
And then it'll make you have
one that you can't remember.

12:37.940 --> 12:40.290
And then it'll go wrong,
and you'll ring them up

12:40.340 --> 12:43.610
and they'll say, "Oh, it's your
fault, you're holding it wrong."

12:43.660 --> 12:44.930
And then one day it'll send

12:44.980 --> 12:47.850
a picture of your bosoms
to the internet.

12:48.580 --> 12:50.450
You're right about
the, um, passwords,

12:50.500 --> 12:52.490
cos Apple iTunes the
other day said to me,

12:52.540 --> 12:55.490
"You must change your password,
it's far too easy to guess."

12:55.540 --> 12:58.930
And I thought, how's anybody ever
going to guess it's "Carrot29?"

12:58.980 --> 13:01.090
~ I mean, that's...
~ Now, I tell you what,

13:01.140 --> 13:04.290
there's a general election
coming up, you may have heard.

13:04.340 --> 13:06.570
~ Is there?
~ Yes, there is, even in Wales.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.690
And, um, and a lot
of people are saying,

13:09.740 --> 13:11.490
"Oh, I can't be bothered
to get involved,

13:11.540 --> 13:14.530
"and all politicians are the same
and all the parties are the same."

13:14.580 --> 13:17.010
So we thought, I wonder if we
could decide who to vote for,

13:17.060 --> 13:18.490
on what the leaders drive.

13:18.540 --> 13:20.090
~ Great idea.
~ Very good idea.

13:20.140 --> 13:21.850
It is, so I've managed
to find it out.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.490
It's not been easy but we've done it.

13:23.540 --> 13:26.370
Now, David Cameron, who runs the
Conservative Party, OK, he...

13:26.420 --> 13:28.730
Well, he doesn't actually have a car,

13:28.780 --> 13:31.050
but the family car
is a Honda CRV, OK?

13:31.100 --> 13:33.370
Nick Clegg has a Ford Galaxy.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.820
~ Oh, dear.
~ Eurgh.
~ Shocking car.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.250
Ed Miliband has a
Lamborghini Aventador.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.640
Does he?

13:43.620 --> 13:47.330
~ I was lying. He's got a
turquoise green Ford Focus.
~ Oh.

13:47.380 --> 13:49.490
Nigel Farage, guess what he drives?

13:49.540 --> 13:50.850
~ A Jag.
~ Yeah, it will be.

13:50.900 --> 13:52.170
~ A Jag!
~ Jag!
~ Anybody else?

13:52.220 --> 13:55.210
Anybody want to hazard a guess,
what Nigel Farage drives.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.250
A what?

13:57.300 --> 13:58.690
~ Bentley!
~ A Bentley, could be.

13:58.740 --> 14:01.210
~ M3.
~ M3?

14:01.260 --> 14:04.260
You are aware of Ukip,
are you, and their...?

14:05.820 --> 14:08.370
Nigel Farage drives a Volvo V70.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.130
~ Does he?
~ Really?

14:10.180 --> 14:12.180
He drives an immigrant.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.130
~ Nicola Sturgeon.
~ Who?

14:17.180 --> 14:18.920
Nicola Sturgeon.

14:19.580 --> 14:22.450
~ SNP, Scottish.
~ Oh, THAT Nicola Sturgeon!

14:22.500 --> 14:25.050
~ Yes, Hammond, that Nicola Sturgeon.
~ What about her?

14:25.100 --> 14:28.410
~ May, have a guess.
~ Oh, I know, uh, a McLaren.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:37.740 --> 14:39.370
Nicola Sturgeon doesn't drive.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.690
~ What, in Scotland?
~ I know, I don't understand.

14:41.740 --> 14:44.450
How do you get around in Scotland,
if you haven't got a car?

14:44.500 --> 14:45.850
No idea, anyway, she doesn't.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.930
Leanne Wood, that's your
lot, Welsh, Plaid Cay-mru!

14:48.980 --> 14:51.010
Er, an ox.

14:52.980 --> 14:54.450
Volkswagen Passat.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.010
Oh, god, I hate the Passat!

14:57.060 --> 14:59.530
Natalie Bennett from the Green Party?

14:59.580 --> 15:01.490
Oh, a Lamborghini LM002.

15:01.540 --> 15:03.930
We've got a picture of one
of those, I think, somewhere.

15:03.980 --> 15:05.570
~ Yes, there it is.
~ That's the one.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.650
You think that the Green
Party boss drives that?

15:07.700 --> 15:09.530
~ Yeah, does she?
~ You're absolutely right.

15:09.580 --> 15:10.850
~ Am I?
~ Yeah, she doesn't.
~ Oh.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.570
No, she doesn't have
one of those, weirdly.

15:13.620 --> 15:16.890
She doesn't own a car but she
is a member of a car club.

15:16.940 --> 15:19.930
Is it the Dodge Charger Owners' Club?

15:19.980 --> 15:23.180
~ Weirdly, James, it isn't.
~ Do they do track days?

15:23.780 --> 15:25.970
The thing is, right,
all these leaders,

15:26.020 --> 15:30.050
every single one of them has
a rubbish car, every single one.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.050
~ Yeah.
~ And I know why.

15:32.100 --> 15:35.170
It's cos they all want to be seen
as a man, or a woman, of the people.

15:35.220 --> 15:38.330
~ Yes, I suspect it is.
~ Yeah, but, yeah, but
you can be seen as a man,

15:38.380 --> 15:41.610
or a woman, of the people, but
still drive an interesting car.

15:41.660 --> 15:44.490
Yeah, you could have a Fiesta
ST. That's a nice car.

15:44.540 --> 15:47.170
Would we vote for somebody
who had a Ford Fiesta ST?

15:47.220 --> 15:48.490
I would, immediately.

15:48.540 --> 15:49.810
I would immediately.

15:49.860 --> 15:51.170
~ What?
~ No.

15:51.220 --> 15:52.490
~ You wouldn't.
~ Why not?

15:52.540 --> 15:56.020
What would you vote for, someone
who's interested in the NHS(?)

15:57.780 --> 16:00.210
No, somebody's who's
interested in Formula 1.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.890
You'd vote for someone,
irrespective of policies,

16:02.940 --> 16:05.130
~ if they were interested in Formula 1?
~ Yes.

16:05.180 --> 16:08.570
Are you watching this, Mr Cameron
and Miliband and Clegg?

16:08.620 --> 16:11.170
This is what's going to
win a massive audience.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.970
Who here would vote for someone
who was interested in Formula 1?

16:15.020 --> 16:19.850
~ Yes!
~ There you go, 100% of the
British people want you to be

16:19.900 --> 16:22.050
interested in Formula 1!

16:22.100 --> 16:27.490
Uh, now, I came down here this
morning in a Volkswagen Golf GTi.

16:27.540 --> 16:31.170
It's what I'm using this week,
absolutely fabulous car.

16:31.220 --> 16:34.170
Yeah, very good, not as good as
the Fiesta ST, but it is good.

16:34.220 --> 16:37.530
It is, except for one thing. It's
got a really annoying thing on it.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.810
Has anyone got a Golf at the
moment with its eco tips?

16:39.860 --> 16:41.130
~ You get the...
~ I do.

16:41.180 --> 16:42.810
How annoying are they?

16:42.860 --> 16:45.690
You're driving along and every
now and again it'll just flash up

16:45.740 --> 16:47.610
a little message on the
dashboard, it goes,

16:47.660 --> 16:50.450
"Why not wind your window
up? Be more aerodynamic."

16:50.500 --> 16:52.130
Cos I want to get some fresh air.

16:52.180 --> 16:54.930
"Why not change up a
gear? It'll be more..."

16:54.980 --> 16:59.210
"Why not, why not shut up," is what
you want to say to it all the time.

16:59.260 --> 17:01.890
It drives you... I'd go mad with it!

17:01.940 --> 17:05.810
If I worked at VW, in their
software department thing,

17:05.859 --> 17:08.410
I'd put some messages in
there but with a time thing,

17:08.460 --> 17:10.849
so that it didn't appear until
after I'd retired, really.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.650
You'd be driving along,
and it would say,

17:12.700 --> 17:15.450
"Wind the window up. Why not slow
down a bit? Why not change up?"

17:15.500 --> 17:16.930
Then it would suddenly just say,

17:16.980 --> 17:19.130
"Why don't you go
and boil your head?"

17:19.180 --> 17:20.810
But it would only say it once,

17:20.859 --> 17:23.050
so you wouldn't be sure
if you'd actually seen it.

17:23.099 --> 17:24.930
And then another time
you'd be driving,

17:24.980 --> 17:28.010
it might be three years later. You'd
be driving along, and it would say,

17:28.060 --> 17:29.730
"Wind your window up, change gear."

17:29.780 --> 17:32.330
Then it would suddenly go,
"You've wasted your life."

17:32.380 --> 17:34.450
But you'd only see
that once, you see.

17:34.500 --> 17:37.090
That would really freak drivers out!

17:37.140 --> 17:38.450
It could suddenly just say,

17:38.500 --> 17:40.930
"Your wife's had an affair
with the bloke next door."

17:40.980 --> 17:43.130
And you'd get to the dealer
and say, "It said that!"

17:43.180 --> 17:45.450
And he'd say, "No, it didn't,
it can't have said that."

17:45.500 --> 17:46.810
It didn't, it can't have done.

17:46.860 --> 17:49.330
But the thing is, though,
it would take Volkswagen

17:49.380 --> 17:50.650
a long time to work out.

17:50.700 --> 17:53.050
Then they would have
to call you up and say,

17:53.100 --> 17:54.650
"Mr May, step into my office."

17:54.700 --> 17:57.290
Ah, but I've retired. I'm
dribbling in an old folks' home

17:57.340 --> 18:00.010
laughing at people
who bought VW Golfs.

18:00.060 --> 18:02.210
Now, I have one more piece of...

18:02.260 --> 18:06.130
I think, ladies and gentlemen,
you're going to enjoy this.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.370
The mayor of Bristol, OK,

18:08.420 --> 18:11.570
he announced fairly recently
that he was going to allocate

18:11.620 --> 18:14.610
£2.3 million of public money

18:14.660 --> 18:18.370
which will be spent on 13,000 signs

18:18.420 --> 18:22.130
saying that there will a 20mph speed
limit across the whole of Bristol.

18:22.180 --> 18:23.730
This is the mayor.

18:23.780 --> 18:26.180
He's just been caught speeding.

18:27.460 --> 18:32.050
I think we should all take a moment
to compose our faces appropriately.

18:32.100 --> 18:35.500
~ Yeah.
~ I'm going to go for serious
and disapproving.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.690
Oh, no! How did...? Oh...

18:38.740 --> 18:42.890
He actually said, afterwards, he
commends Avon and Somerset police

18:42.940 --> 18:44.850
for being so vigilant
in catching him.

18:44.900 --> 18:48.490
I bet he didn't say that when the
letter came through the post box.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.050
Right, let's move on.

18:50.100 --> 18:54.170
Now, last year McLaren gave
us the astonishing P1,

18:54.220 --> 18:58.770
and Porsche gave us the
equally fantastic 918.

18:58.820 --> 19:03.850
But we've always known that there
is another hybrid supercar coming.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.250
Well, it's not coming any more.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.890
It's here, it's the one you've
all been waiting for,

19:08.940 --> 19:10.930
and I have been driving it -

19:10.980 --> 19:13.620
The Ferrari, the Ferrari!

19:23.700 --> 19:27.690
'McLaren and Porsche may believe
they've created good-looking cars

19:27.740 --> 19:29.860
'in the P1 and the 918.

19:34.180 --> 19:38.690
'But I think they need to get
their pencil cases out again,

19:38.740 --> 19:42.340
'because THIS is what a supercar
should look like.'

19:57.700 --> 20:01.090
And THIS is what a supercar
should sound like!

20:10.980 --> 20:14.250
No miserable V8s or puny
little turbochargers -

20:14.300 --> 20:17.140
THAT is Ferrari's Greatest Hit!

20:19.500 --> 20:23.890
The sound of 12 cylinders
properly arranged in a V.

20:23.940 --> 20:26.260
Molte grazie!

20:33.860 --> 20:35.450
And then there's the price.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.800
LaFerrari has the other
two licked there, as well.

20:40.420 --> 20:43.930
The Porsche 918, £646,000.

20:43.980 --> 20:48.050
The McLaren V1, £866,000.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.700
The LaFerrari?

20:51.380 --> 20:53.090
A million pounds!

20:53.140 --> 20:54.650
That's a proper price!

20:54.700 --> 20:56.440
No muckin' about!

20:57.780 --> 21:00.090
'And there's more.'

21:00.140 --> 21:03.450
Pinky and Perky have been
at great pains to explain

21:03.500 --> 21:06.370
just how clever the McLaren
and the Porsche are.

21:06.420 --> 21:10.460
Well, this is also very clever.

21:13.820 --> 21:16.130
It's built from not one,

21:16.180 --> 21:19.970
but four different
types of carbon fibre

21:20.020 --> 21:22.370
to keep it as light as possible.

21:22.420 --> 21:26.180
In fact, it's lighter than
the Porsche OR the McLaren.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.330
The driver's seat is fixed,

21:29.380 --> 21:32.090
and, instead, it's the wheel
and pedals that move.

21:32.140 --> 21:34.970
This means you don't
need a seat mechanism,

21:35.020 --> 21:39.410
which means the driver can sit
lower, the roof can be lower,

21:39.460 --> 21:43.170
and that drops the
centre of gravity...

21:43.220 --> 21:46.010
to the benefit of cornering.

21:46.060 --> 21:48.330
Then, we come to the engine.

21:51.460 --> 21:55.370
Like the McLaren and the Porsche,
LaFerrari is a hybrid -

21:55.420 --> 21:59.410
it has a petrol engine AND an electric
motor to drive the wheels.

21:59.460 --> 22:03.410
BUT... whereas the other two can
be driven on electric power alone,

22:03.460 --> 22:08.090
like a Toyota Prius, the Ferrari
can't, because, Ferrari say,

22:08.140 --> 22:11.730
"We are not interested
in electric cars."

22:11.780 --> 22:15.050
Instead, the battery and
electric motor combination

22:15.100 --> 22:20.610
works a bit like the kinetic energy
recovery system in an F1 car.

22:20.660 --> 22:24.370
In very simple terms, it captures
energy that's normally wasted -

22:24.420 --> 22:28.500
during braking, for example - and
keeps it for when you need it.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.730
The electric motor,
the petrol engine -

22:39.780 --> 22:42.530
they're all working together,
all of the time.

22:42.580 --> 22:44.720
You cannot separate them.

22:46.500 --> 22:50.900
This is simply a 950
horsepower supercar.

22:54.620 --> 22:57.050
But, despite the racing technology,

22:57.100 --> 23:01.220
you don't find yourself in a world
of austere track-car misery.

23:03.580 --> 23:05.330
You've got the sat nav,

23:05.380 --> 23:07.410
the air conditioning...

23:07.460 --> 23:09.730
It's perfectly comfortable.

23:09.780 --> 23:12.900
Actually, it's very civilised.

23:16.700 --> 23:20.130
However, this is also supposed
to be the fastest

23:20.180 --> 23:22.290
and most exciting road car

23:22.340 --> 23:24.340
Ferrari has ever made.

23:24.980 --> 23:28.020
And to find out how exciting,
we must come here...

23:29.980 --> 23:32.250
Ferrari's Fiorano test track.

23:34.060 --> 23:37.330
To Prancing Horse fans,
this is the sacred tarmac

23:37.380 --> 23:40.580
where the company's greatest
F1 cars were born.

23:42.820 --> 23:47.610
But when I rolled up, "sacred"
wasn't the word that came to mind.

23:53.220 --> 23:54.850
Oh, cock!

23:54.900 --> 23:58.660
'After two hours of dithering
on the start line...'

23:59.940 --> 24:02.410
Pedals a little bit further away.

24:03.420 --> 24:05.890
No, that's too far away. Hang on.

24:06.580 --> 24:09.820
'.. the track was finally dry
enough for me to have a go.'

24:12.580 --> 24:14.520
Red, red, red, red...

24:25.940 --> 24:28.100
God's holy trousers!

24:37.900 --> 24:40.770
Strewth! I'm already
at the first bend.

24:40.820 --> 24:42.490
Lots of brakes.

24:46.020 --> 24:49.980
That, ladies and gentlemen,
is 950 horsepower for you!

24:51.100 --> 24:52.290
And while we're at it,

24:52.340 --> 24:55.620
950 horsepower is a slam-dunk
Top Trump over the other two.

24:58.060 --> 25:01.860
And so is the top speed - 218mph.

25:03.900 --> 25:07.330
'But it's not just the amount
of horsepower that's impressive,

25:07.380 --> 25:09.720
'it's the way it's served up.'

25:10.380 --> 25:13.210
Even if you're a bit
clumsy or a bit timid,

25:13.260 --> 25:15.090
as I am being on this one,

25:15.140 --> 25:17.170
you've still got that enormous grunt.

25:17.220 --> 25:19.960
It just hits you like
a runaway train.

25:21.740 --> 25:23.530
That's the KERS system working.

25:23.580 --> 25:25.850
That's exactly what it's for.

25:27.060 --> 25:28.930
'On top of that, Ferrari
has remembered

25:28.980 --> 25:31.130
'that not everyone
who'll drive this car

25:31.180 --> 25:33.780
'will be called Sebastian or Vettel.'

25:38.540 --> 25:42.290
Because LaFerrari will go quite
a lot faster than you can think,

25:42.340 --> 25:44.490
Ferrari do quite a lot
of thinking for you.

25:44.540 --> 25:47.090
It has for example a
very, very sophisticated

25:47.140 --> 25:50.250
traction control system
based on Formula 1 tech,

25:50.300 --> 25:52.530
and you can leave it turned on.

25:52.580 --> 25:53.930
Why not?

25:53.980 --> 25:55.850
Stops you crashing.

25:57.020 --> 26:00.650
LaFerrari also bristles
with active aerodynamics.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.810
That's not new on a supercar,

26:02.860 --> 26:06.850
but this system is controlled
by 21 computers...

26:06.900 --> 26:09.890
which means, according
to the Ferrari eggheads,

26:09.940 --> 26:14.180
even I should be able to take
Fiorano's notorious Turn 7...

26:15.580 --> 26:17.120
.. flat out.

26:19.060 --> 26:21.530
Active aerodynamics - here we go.

26:22.340 --> 26:26.010
Don't bottle it, don't bottle it!

26:26.060 --> 26:27.800
Oh-ho-ho-hoo...!

26:29.300 --> 26:31.300
It works! Look at that!

26:34.260 --> 26:37.000
The faster you go,
the better it works!

26:38.820 --> 26:40.850
I mean, like Jennifer's McLaren,

26:40.900 --> 26:43.290
it is pure rear-wheel drive,

26:43.340 --> 26:47.140
and that's quite intimidating,
but it's not a widowmaker.

26:51.340 --> 26:53.890
Ah-ha-ha-ha...!

26:53.940 --> 26:55.410
Oh, my God!

26:57.140 --> 26:58.620
Oh, yes!

27:02.140 --> 27:03.940
Wahey! (Sorry!)

27:05.940 --> 27:08.290
Right, let's just slow
this down a bit.

27:08.340 --> 27:11.090
Richard Hammond, he
says the Porsche 918 -

27:11.140 --> 27:14.410
that's the one that takes the
hybrid supercar the furthest.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.570
It's the most responsible,
if you like.

27:16.620 --> 27:18.570
Jeremy likes the P1 because he says

27:18.620 --> 27:21.890
it takes an idea that was
essentially an environmental one

27:21.940 --> 27:25.040
and uses it to make the
supercar more dramatic.

27:27.020 --> 27:30.340
'In this respect, the Ferrari
is more like the McLaren.'

27:32.860 --> 27:34.930
Except for two things...

27:35.540 --> 27:38.050
LaFerrari looks better...

27:38.100 --> 27:40.240
and I reckon it IS better.

27:42.660 --> 27:45.420
This is the greatest
car in the world!

28:05.180 --> 28:06.810
Well, now there we are.

28:06.860 --> 28:08.400
Here we are.

28:10.140 --> 28:13.010
Now you may remember last year,

28:13.060 --> 28:15.930
after Hammond had driven
the Porsche I said to him,

28:15.980 --> 28:20.810
that if it turned out to be faster
around our track than the McLaren

28:20.860 --> 28:23.050
I would change my name
by deed poll to Jennifer -

28:23.100 --> 28:24.330
you remember that?

28:24.380 --> 28:26.610
~ Oh, yeah. You said that.
~ Yes!

28:26.660 --> 28:29.130
And now we have James May telling us,

28:29.180 --> 28:30.690
rather bumptiously, I think,

28:30.740 --> 28:33.770
because he hasn't driven
the McLaren or the Porsche,

28:33.820 --> 28:35.450
that the Ferrari is best.

28:35.500 --> 28:39.930
So, who here would like
to see which of these cars

28:39.980 --> 28:42.410
is the fastest round our track?

28:42.460 --> 28:44.410
Yes!

28:44.460 --> 28:46.130
So would we.

28:46.180 --> 28:47.490
So would Porsche.

28:47.540 --> 28:48.930
But we have a problem.

28:48.980 --> 28:53.170
McLaren has said that we can't
do the test at our track.

28:53.220 --> 28:55.290
What?

28:55.340 --> 28:57.930
Well, hang on - our track
is also McLaren's track.

28:57.980 --> 29:00.570
~ That's where they developed this car.
~ Yes, I know,

29:00.620 --> 29:03.330
and because I know that,
I also know that they know

29:03.380 --> 29:06.130
that the twiddly bits at
the Hammerhead, and so on,

29:06.180 --> 29:09.810
will favour the four-wheel
drive system of the Porsche.

29:09.860 --> 29:11.890
All right, we'll do it
at a different track.

29:11.940 --> 29:13.970
Well, that brings us on
to the second problem.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.210
Ferrari has spent the
last six months saying,

29:16.260 --> 29:18.090
"No, we don't want to do it, at all.

29:18.140 --> 29:20.930
"Cos we're not interested in
speed, or 0-60, or lap times..."

29:20.980 --> 29:22.330
Really(?)

29:22.380 --> 29:25.570
That's what they've been saying,
but... I kid you not, they have.

29:25.620 --> 29:29.090
But in the last couple of weeks
or so, they've started to soften

29:29.140 --> 29:31.730
and say, "Well, maybe
we can lend you a car."

29:31.780 --> 29:33.210
Well, there you go then. Game on.

29:33.260 --> 29:34.730
No, see, there's another problem.

29:34.780 --> 29:37.170
McLaren is saying they
will only do this

29:37.220 --> 29:39.330
if all of the cars are customer cars,

29:39.380 --> 29:41.530
they're production cars
that have been sold - yes?

29:41.580 --> 29:45.690
They don't want them turning up with
sticky tyres and 17 turbos on them.

29:45.740 --> 29:47.890
Ferrari is saying they'll only do it

29:47.940 --> 29:51.130
if the cars DO come direct
from the factory.

29:51.180 --> 29:52.330
Well, all right, then.

29:52.380 --> 29:55.170
We'll find someone who has a Ferrari
a Ferrari, and borrow it.

29:55.220 --> 29:57.050
I know someone who has one.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.970
So do I, James. They've covered
us on that one, I'm afraid.

30:00.020 --> 30:02.370
Ferrari has actually said, to us,

30:02.420 --> 30:03.890
that if any Ferrari owner

30:03.940 --> 30:06.170
lends us a Ferrari a Ferrari,

30:06.220 --> 30:09.370
they will make sure that
person can never ever buy

30:09.420 --> 30:11.690
a limited edition Ferrari ever again.

30:11.740 --> 30:13.850
I kid you not!

30:13.900 --> 30:15.170
~ Ridiculous...!
~ I kid you not.

30:15.220 --> 30:16.890
I've never heard anything like this.

30:16.940 --> 30:20.410
Pony club mothers have got NOTHING
on the people who make these cars!

30:20.460 --> 30:22.330
Nothing!

30:22.380 --> 30:25.370
It doesn't make any sense! If I built
any of these cars - any of them -

30:25.420 --> 30:26.810
the first thing I'd want to do

30:26.860 --> 30:29.090
is see how fast they were
compared to the others.

30:29.140 --> 30:30.570
That's what they're for!

30:30.620 --> 30:34.570
Honestly, if I were a teacher and I
had McLaren and Ferrari in my class,

30:34.620 --> 30:36.490
I would box their ears!

30:36.540 --> 30:39.570
I'd say, "Go and see the headmaster
and come back when you've grown up."

30:39.620 --> 30:41.010
~ Look.
~ What?

30:41.060 --> 30:43.490
They are here, the track's
there... Let's just do it!

30:43.540 --> 30:45.770
Yes, James. They're here
and they're locked

30:45.820 --> 30:47.970
and those two security
guards have been provided,

30:48.020 --> 30:50.890
to make sure we don't just take them
out on the track after the show.

30:50.940 --> 30:52.650
~ You're kidding?
~ I am not kidding.

30:52.700 --> 30:55.050
So, this is it? It ends here,
it's not gonna happen?

30:55.100 --> 30:56.570
No, no, no, no. We're not giving up.

30:56.620 --> 30:58.970
We've actually heard this week
of a man in the Middle East

30:59.020 --> 31:00.610
who owns one of each of these cars,

31:00.660 --> 31:03.570
and he may be willing
to lend them to us.

31:03.620 --> 31:05.210
Well, there you go. Give him a call.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.260
He's called Bin Laden.

31:08.260 --> 31:09.770
I'm not kidding, he is.

31:09.820 --> 31:11.730
What, as in... Bin Laden?

31:11.780 --> 31:14.730
No, he's dead. It was definitely
on the news. I saw that.

31:14.780 --> 31:16.410
He's a cousin of that one.

31:16.460 --> 31:18.650
Well, you can't judge
a man by his cousin.

31:18.700 --> 31:20.890
You're absolutely right,
Hammond. You can't.

31:20.940 --> 31:23.410
~ But things go wrong on
Top Gear, yes? All the time.
~ Yeah.

31:23.460 --> 31:25.290
Do you want to make the call -

31:25.340 --> 31:29.050
"Hello, Mr Bin Laden. I've just crashed
your Porsche into your Ferrari"?

31:29.100 --> 31:31.170
I don't want to make that
call, you're right. No.

31:31.220 --> 31:34.730
So here we are, we haven't done it,
but we're not going to give up.

31:34.780 --> 31:36.210
OK, in fact, what we're hoping -

31:36.260 --> 31:37.970
and I hope you all
hope the same thing -

31:38.020 --> 31:39.610
is that, on Monday morning,

31:39.660 --> 31:42.930
we get a call from Ferrari
and from McLaren saying -

31:42.980 --> 31:45.690
"You know what, let's do this thing."
Do you want to hear that?

31:45.740 --> 31:48.690
~ Yes!
~ "Let's just do this thing."
~ Come on!

31:54.820 --> 31:56.690
Anyway, it is now time...

31:56.740 --> 31:58.370
It's now time to move on

31:58.420 --> 32:01.530
and put a Star in a
Reasonably Priced Car.

32:01.580 --> 32:04.450
In fact, all week, we've
had people ringing me up

32:04.500 --> 32:07.890
saying, "How on earth are you going
to top Will Smith, from last week -

32:07.940 --> 32:10.250
"star of I Am Legend
and Hancock and so on?"

32:10.300 --> 32:13.770
Well, that is easy, because
tonight, we have, as my guest,

32:13.820 --> 32:18.330
the runner-up in the 2009
X Factor competition.

32:18.380 --> 32:20.820
Ladies and gentlemen, Olly Murs!

32:22.900 --> 32:24.370
~ What's happening?
~ Good evening.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.450
~ Jeremy.
~ How are you?
~ Good to see you, how are you?

32:26.500 --> 32:29.050
~ Very well. How's things?
~ Hello! Good, thanks.

32:29.100 --> 32:32.530
~ He's here!
~ Ah.
~ Have a seat.

32:32.580 --> 32:34.520
It's a pleasure. Wow.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.730
Now, I know that was a slightly
mean introduction,

32:37.780 --> 32:41.010
but actually, being a
runner-up in X Factor

32:41.060 --> 32:42.810
is better than winning it.

32:42.860 --> 32:44.810
Oh, I... yeah, I suppose it is.

32:44.860 --> 32:48.210
But, um, obviously I wanted to win
the show, I'm Mr Competitive - so.

32:48.260 --> 32:49.610
I know, but if you win X Factor,

32:49.660 --> 32:51.570
what, you end up back
in Homebase in a week.

32:51.620 --> 32:54.250
Or on a cruise liner.

32:54.300 --> 32:57.170
Yeah, but I think it's lucky, no matter
where you finish on the show -

32:57.220 --> 32:58.730
you don't know where you'll finish.

32:58.780 --> 33:01.170
I thought after about a year
or two I'd probably be,

33:01.220 --> 33:03.050
you know, in a call
centre again, so...

33:03.100 --> 33:05.650
Cos it is - I'm just thinking,
One Direction came second.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.850
~ Yeah... no...
~ JLS came second.

33:07.900 --> 33:10.930
Oh, no, One Direction finished
third, JLS finished second.

33:10.980 --> 33:13.770
I'd be standing there, at the end,
judging on the facts and figures,

33:13.820 --> 33:16.970
going, "Please don't let me
win, please don't let me win."

33:17.020 --> 33:18.930
Cos then I'll be successful,
like you, cos...

33:18.980 --> 33:19.970
Oh, cheers, thank you.

33:20.020 --> 33:22.290
How successful - how many
albums have you sold now?

33:22.340 --> 33:23.930
~ Um...
~ 10 million?

33:23.980 --> 33:26.090
No, it's 10 million
in total, but, um...

33:26.140 --> 33:27.930
~ That's a lot.
~ For singles and everything.

33:27.980 --> 33:30.130
I think the albums, about
three million, I think?

33:30.180 --> 33:32.810
~ That's a lot of albums these days.
~ Well, I'm delighted, yeah.

33:32.860 --> 33:35.210
I mean, it's not really
an album market so, um...

33:35.260 --> 33:38.650
No, I'm delighted that everyone's
been buying my album, so thank you.

33:38.700 --> 33:41.490
And what did you do then before
singing to Simon Cowell?

33:41.540 --> 33:44.250
I was just working in a call centre.
I was giving people advice

33:44.300 --> 33:46.490
on how to save money
on their energy bills.

33:46.540 --> 33:48.810
So you were living in Bombay?

33:51.020 --> 33:53.570
No - no, no this was
just in Witham in Essex.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.530
~ You are an Essex boy?
~ Essex boy, yeah.

33:55.580 --> 33:58.370
~ Yeah.
~ Through and through, yeah.
~ And not just an Essex boy,

33:58.420 --> 34:01.090
but we are talking about a
major petrolhead, are we not?

34:01.140 --> 34:02.570
100%, yeah - love my cars.

34:02.620 --> 34:06.610
I'd say that before I was famous
and got into this, you know,

34:06.660 --> 34:08.449
I didn't have the most glamorous car.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.170
What was your first car?

34:10.219 --> 34:13.010
My first car was a Fiat Ciquento.

34:14.980 --> 34:16.690
~ I think it's Cinquecento.
~ Cinquecento.

34:16.739 --> 34:19.010
Which of course was made
famous by The Inbetweeners.

34:19.060 --> 34:20.409
Exactly - there it is.

34:20.460 --> 34:22.530
I've still got that, that's
still at my house.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.929
~ Is that actually yours?
~ It's still mine, yeah.
~ Oh, wow.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.409
Do you know what, though?
I spent more money...

34:27.460 --> 34:31.770
That car cost me 895 quid
and I spent, I think,

34:31.820 --> 34:35.060
950 quid on the sound system for it.

34:36.620 --> 34:38.330
So I could bowl round Essex -

34:38.380 --> 34:41.409
"Hey, what's happening?
All right, boys?"

34:41.460 --> 34:43.929
I'm presuming as well if you'd
won X Factor and you got that,

34:43.980 --> 34:46.570
there would've been a few
trouser-related incidents in that.

34:46.620 --> 34:48.330
Oh, God, yeah. Well, the one...

34:48.380 --> 34:49.900
Oh, God.

34:50.980 --> 34:53.170
My fans will tell you I'm
always ripping my trousers.

34:53.219 --> 34:55.050
I... I was at work one day -

34:55.100 --> 34:57.050
I was actually working
in recruitment then.

34:57.100 --> 34:58.850
And, um... I was just
lifting some boxes,

34:58.900 --> 35:01.250
about 10 o'clock in the day,
I moved down to lift the boxes

35:01.300 --> 35:03.290
and I ripped all the backend
of me trousers out.

35:03.340 --> 35:05.250
And I want to go home.
So I got in my car

35:05.300 --> 35:07.330
and I've drummed out of the car park,

35:07.380 --> 35:10.290
I've just turned round the corner,
got up towards the traffic lights.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.250
And I've just gone to
put my seat belt on.

35:12.300 --> 35:15.530
All of a sudden, the police car's just
come round the corner, seen me do that

35:15.580 --> 35:17.690
and pulled... and gone in behind me.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.650
And I'm like, "Oh,

35:19.700 --> 35:23.530
So then I drove to Tesco's car
park, pulled over, then got out.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.210
And obviously I'm stood there,
in the middle of Tesco car park

35:26.260 --> 35:28.730
at lunchtime, with all
me bits hanging out.

35:28.780 --> 35:31.530
Oh, it was so embarrassing!
They gave me...

35:31.580 --> 35:33.370
I think they gave me
a £60 fine or something.

35:33.420 --> 35:35.530
Oh, you got a £60 fine
for having your...?

35:35.580 --> 35:39.330
No, no - they probably could
have got me done for that!

35:39.380 --> 35:40.970
~ Oh, the seat belt.
~ For the seat belt.

35:41.020 --> 35:43.650
Well, who here would
like to see Olly's lap?

35:43.700 --> 35:44.850
Yeah!

35:44.900 --> 35:46.890
Play the tape.

35:52.300 --> 35:54.370
Oh, I was...

35:56.380 --> 35:57.930
Oh...

35:57.980 --> 35:59.900
Sorry, mate.

36:00.900 --> 36:04.050
That was a gig, a lap on a lap.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.570
I didn't have time to
prepare myself then -

36:06.620 --> 36:09.010
I actually thought that was the
lap, so I was like, "Phew!"

36:09.060 --> 36:12.850
No, that...well, it was your lap,
but not the lap we're talking about.

36:12.900 --> 36:17.690
~ Presumably, now that the
Fiat is parked up somewhere...
~ Yeah.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.930
.. you've gone on,
as a car enthusiast,

36:19.980 --> 36:23.170
to buy something a little bit
more, I don't know, starry.

36:23.220 --> 36:25.810
No - well, yeah, no,
I went for a few BMWs

36:25.860 --> 36:27.170
and then I decided, I was like,

36:27.220 --> 36:28.810
"You know what? I'm going to go big."

36:28.860 --> 36:32.170
So I went and got myself
a Bentley Continental GT.

36:32.220 --> 36:35.330
Oh - now, that's an interesting car,
actually. Which one have you got?

36:35.380 --> 36:37.970
It's just a Continental GT V8.

36:38.020 --> 36:39.330
That's correct.

36:39.380 --> 36:43.090
~ Yes. OK.
~ Because there's so many mines
you can tread on on your way.

36:43.140 --> 36:44.730
~ It's not a convertible, is it?
~ No.
~ No.

36:44.780 --> 36:47.170
You see, I think the convertible
makes you look stupid.

36:47.220 --> 36:49.810
Yeah, cos whenever you
see a convertible Bentley,

36:49.860 --> 36:51.890
people've always got,
like, the bright blue,

36:51.940 --> 36:53.890
or it's in bright red
or it's white or...

36:53.940 --> 36:56.730
~ And they've got an orange face.
~ Yeah.
~ And you're in Cheshire.

36:56.780 --> 36:58.650
~ Or Essex.
~ Or Essex.

36:59.780 --> 37:03.050
Anyway - now you came down here,
cos interestingly, we have had

37:03.100 --> 37:05.170
a slight problem with The Stig today.

37:05.220 --> 37:06.970
I mean, this is not a word of a lie.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.530
We had Will Smith here last
week, as you probably know.

37:09.580 --> 37:11.210
The Stig had never heard of him.

37:11.260 --> 37:14.010
~ Shut up!
~ Kiefer Sutherland, a couple of weeks ago -

37:14.060 --> 37:15.690
never heard of him.

37:15.740 --> 37:18.050
There was Ed Sheeran,
week one - no idea.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.810
~ He doesn't know who anyone is.
~ Wowsers.

37:19.860 --> 37:22.490
He came here this
morning - Olly Murs,

37:22.540 --> 37:24.370
he's completely in love with you.

37:24.420 --> 37:25.690
Nah!

37:27.260 --> 37:30.010
The Stig, you are his - apart
from The Carpenters, obviously -

37:30.060 --> 37:32.330
his absolute favourite artist.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.850
You know what, can I just say this?

37:33.900 --> 37:36.090
I don't know if people want
to know this information,

37:36.140 --> 37:38.130
but I'm delighted with it - I went...

37:38.180 --> 37:40.770
I walked into the toilet
to have... you know.

37:40.820 --> 37:42.690
He was in there.

37:42.740 --> 37:45.610
~ Have you seen his penis?
~ Well, no, well...

37:48.700 --> 37:51.900
He was wearing his helmet
still, so it wasn't...

37:53.500 --> 37:54.930
He wasn't... he wasn't...

37:54.980 --> 37:59.280
I thought he was going to be holding
his helmet, but I suppose...

38:03.180 --> 38:05.090
This is all big news!

38:05.140 --> 38:06.250
But wait, wait...

38:06.300 --> 38:09.450
Well, my best ever celebrity
story was, um...

38:09.500 --> 38:10.770
You can't top that!

38:10.820 --> 38:14.020
It was another toilet incident with
Gary Barlow which... which was...

38:15.820 --> 38:18.100
Absolutely fantastic, yeah.

38:19.340 --> 38:22.330
But now I've gone to the... I've
been in the toilet with the Stig,

38:22.380 --> 38:23.450
it's pretty amazing.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.650
~ Anyway...
~ Yes.

38:24.700 --> 38:29.130
It was... presumably, you went out
in the Vauxhall Astra Tech Line.

38:29.180 --> 38:30.770
~ Yes.
~ Many laps, many practices?

38:30.820 --> 38:33.090
Loved it, did a few, quite
a few practices, really.

38:33.140 --> 38:35.690
I was giving it some, like,
"Come on!" I could feel it.

38:35.740 --> 38:38.050
You know when you get to the
end, you're like, "Come on!"

38:38.100 --> 38:41.050
Would you like to see the
real, actual lap in a car?

38:41.100 --> 38:43.700
~ Yeah!
~ Here we go, let's have a look.

38:46.300 --> 38:48.010
We're away.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.490
Come on, baby.

38:49.540 --> 38:51.210
Purr with me!

38:51.260 --> 38:54.060
You're looking like
Val Kilmer in there.

38:55.060 --> 38:57.660
Oh, yeah, that's aggressive turning.

38:59.540 --> 39:03.450
Same line that Ricciardo was
using the other day, very good.

39:03.500 --> 39:08.420
♪ Don't cry for me, Argentina... ♪

39:09.660 --> 39:11.600
Don't sing that here.

39:13.540 --> 39:15.130
There we are, nicely done through...

39:15.180 --> 39:18.850
Sorry for my language, Mum, I
apologise, didn't mean to swear.

39:18.900 --> 39:21.010
You haven't sworn.

39:21.060 --> 39:22.690
~ Right, you've gotta
~ BLEEP
~ do this!

39:22.740 --> 39:26.020
No, you have sworn now.
That was swearing there.

39:27.780 --> 39:32.650
OK, that's about as perfect
as it comes, that is.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.010
As is that.

39:34.060 --> 39:36.170
No real understeer,
that's good to see.

39:36.220 --> 39:37.420
70...

39:39.100 --> 39:40.300
80...

39:42.500 --> 39:45.010
Yep, flat through there.

39:45.060 --> 39:47.810
~ Yeah, I felt... I felt
good going through there.
~ Yeah.

39:47.860 --> 39:51.010
I got into fourth gear just
as I got to the tyres.

39:51.060 --> 39:52.610
~ That's what you...
~ This was the bend.

39:52.660 --> 39:54.530
This is the - oh, look
at it squirming there,

39:54.580 --> 39:56.410
that is nicely held.

39:56.460 --> 39:59.770
It's a good chassis, that, but
you're getting the best out of it.

39:59.820 --> 40:01.170
and that is bob-on as well.

40:01.220 --> 40:02.810
There we are, across the line!

40:02.860 --> 40:04.460
Ah!

40:05.460 --> 40:07.130
So there we go.

40:10.980 --> 40:14.330
Where do you think you've
come, on the board?

40:14.380 --> 40:18.450
My aim was 1.46 - I just wanted to...

40:18.500 --> 40:20.050
You wanted to beat Hugh Jackman.

40:20.100 --> 40:24.170
~ 1.46 is an ambitious...
~ I know.
~ Very ambitious.

40:24.220 --> 40:26.530
Oh, God, put me out of my misery.

40:26.580 --> 40:29.490
As long as I've beaten Jack, that's
all I care about, come on.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.810
~ Everybody could beat Jack.
~ I can't look - tell me when.

40:31.860 --> 40:35.160
Stevie Wonder next week
- he's going to beat Jack.

40:37.220 --> 40:38.960
You did a one...

40:40.740 --> 40:42.080
.. 40...

40:43.300 --> 40:45.900
You want me to say "six", don't you?

40:45.980 --> 40:47.980
I'm going to say four.

40:49.020 --> 40:50.160
No!

40:52.620 --> 40:55.850
So actually, you're up there
with only Aaron Paul,

40:55.900 --> 40:58.970
~ as in Breaking Bad, on 1.44.7.
~ Shut up.

40:59.020 --> 41:01.090
He's on a seven.

41:01.140 --> 41:05.180
So if it's lower than seven,
you're the fastest ever.

41:08.060 --> 41:09.090
It's six.

41:09.140 --> 41:11.730
YES! Come on!

41:11.780 --> 41:13.530
You did it!

41:13.580 --> 41:16.650
Get in! Oh, my God!

41:16.700 --> 41:19.170
~ That's the fastest we've ever had.
~ Whoo!

41:19.220 --> 41:22.330
The fastest man in all of the world!

41:22.380 --> 41:23.970
Olly Murs!

41:24.020 --> 41:27.330
I didn't... I didn't
finish runner-up!

41:27.380 --> 41:29.530
~ That is the fastest we've ever had.
~ Oh, my God.

41:29.580 --> 41:31.410
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:31.460 --> 41:36.650
Olly Murs - the fastest
man ever round our track!

41:36.700 --> 41:38.570
Oh, thanks, Jeremy.

41:41.900 --> 41:46.210
Now, there are many truly
great car companies,

41:46.260 --> 41:48.570
all with rich,
magnificent histories -

41:48.620 --> 41:52.650
there's Ferrari, Jaguar,
Lancia, Maserati

41:52.700 --> 41:54.730
and so on and so on.

41:54.780 --> 41:57.130
Yes, indeed, but tonight, James and I

41:57.180 --> 42:00.410
are going to look at the history
of the most brilliant,

42:00.460 --> 42:04.010
most inventive car
company of them all -

42:04.060 --> 42:05.400
Peugeot.

42:13.660 --> 42:16.170
For thousands of years,
there was only one way

42:16.220 --> 42:18.930
of crossing this spartan landscape

42:18.980 --> 42:22.740
in the vast, dusty
heat of North Africa.

42:24.940 --> 42:26.480
This was it.

42:27.900 --> 42:30.890
It was used by the Greeks,
the Romans, the Berbers,

42:30.940 --> 42:34.170
the Phoenicians, the Vandals,
the Arabs, the Carthaginians,

42:34.220 --> 42:38.050
the Ottomans, the French,
the Tuareg, the Italians

42:38.100 --> 42:39.840
and the British.

42:41.940 --> 42:44.450
But then, in 1968,

42:44.500 --> 42:47.770
the camel's 4,000-year
monopoly was ended...

42:49.700 --> 42:52.460
.. by the Peugeot 504.

42:59.620 --> 43:02.650
Many people imagine it
was Land Rover or Jeep

43:02.700 --> 43:04.810
that brought internal combustion

43:04.860 --> 43:07.890
to the world's most
impregnable backwaters,

43:07.940 --> 43:10.180
but really, it was this.

43:11.620 --> 43:14.420
The King of Africa,
as they called it.

43:16.820 --> 43:20.730
Yes, it had good ground clearance
and parts were cheap,

43:20.780 --> 43:24.450
but what really endeared this
mighty Peugeot to Africa

43:24.500 --> 43:26.770
was its rugged dependability.

43:28.060 --> 43:30.610
You regularly hear tales
around these parts

43:30.660 --> 43:34.570
of 504s that have done
a million kilometres

43:34.620 --> 43:38.410
and which have been to places
that no Land Rover could reach

43:38.460 --> 43:40.600
without falling to pieces.

43:41.900 --> 43:46.290
40 years ago, then, Peugeot was
a byword for sturdy toughness

43:46.340 --> 43:48.100
and common sense.

43:49.700 --> 43:53.170
But then, in 1983, Peugeot decided

43:53.220 --> 43:58.570
it didn't want to make strong,
sturdy, beige cars any more.

43:58.620 --> 44:01.570
It wanted to throw
off its sensi-panties

44:01.620 --> 44:04.730
and be sporty and frivolous and fun.

44:04.780 --> 44:07.320
So it completely changed direction.

44:10.820 --> 44:13.530
It employed a brilliant
"chef de suspension"

44:13.580 --> 44:15.650
and came up with cars like this -

44:15.700 --> 44:21.180
the 505 GTi, a sports
saloon to rival any BMW.

44:24.140 --> 44:27.250
And then there was the 405 Mi16,

44:27.300 --> 44:29.250
which sounded like
it was a machine gun,

44:29.300 --> 44:31.240
and it went like one.

44:34.180 --> 44:36.980
But best of all, Peugeot
gave us this...

44:37.860 --> 44:40.570
The phenomenal 205 GTi,

44:40.620 --> 44:42.860
a car that was fast...

44:44.020 --> 44:46.620
.. even with James May at the wheel.

44:47.340 --> 44:49.650
Was this the best hot
hatchback of the '80s?

44:49.700 --> 44:52.800
Well, it was definitely
a contender, wasn't it?

44:55.180 --> 44:56.920
It's still good.

44:58.460 --> 45:01.330
It's hard to believe that this
was made by the same people

45:01.380 --> 45:02.610
who did the 504 -

45:02.660 --> 45:05.060
made by the same species, even.

45:07.340 --> 45:08.930
But this wasn't the first time

45:08.980 --> 45:11.690
that Peugeot had completely
changed its mind

45:11.740 --> 45:13.940
about what it wanted to be.

45:15.300 --> 45:18.330
The company began
in 1810 making steel

45:18.380 --> 45:21.250
and it was very, very good at it.

45:21.300 --> 45:23.090
So good that, in 1840,

45:23.140 --> 45:26.050
it decided to start making
wooden pepper grinders.

45:26.100 --> 45:29.650
Now, these... they were the best
pepper grinders in the world.

45:29.700 --> 45:33.810
So, naturally, in 1852,
Peugeot started to make...

45:33.860 --> 45:35.090
.. corsets.

45:35.140 --> 45:36.970
And then, 30 years later,

45:37.020 --> 45:40.290
it thought, "No - what
we actually want to make

45:40.340 --> 45:41.930
"are bicycles."

45:41.980 --> 45:45.010
And this is what they came up with.

45:45.060 --> 45:46.730
And it is brilliant.

45:46.780 --> 45:48.930
It is a superb bicycle.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.690
But naturally, having
made a superb bicycle,

45:51.740 --> 45:54.650
the next logical step was
to become a manufacturer

45:54.700 --> 45:56.330
of munitions.

45:56.380 --> 46:00.210
The shells they made were
excellent. World-class.

46:00.260 --> 46:04.130
But then the Second World War
broke out, the Germans arrived,

46:04.180 --> 46:07.970
and Mr Peugeot decided he didn't
want to make munitions any more.

46:08.020 --> 46:10.330
In fact, he didn't
want to make anything.

46:10.380 --> 46:13.770
So one night, he laced his
factory with explosives

46:13.820 --> 46:18.170
and blew the entire
place to smithereens.

46:18.220 --> 46:21.210
After such a varied history,
it's hardly surprising

46:21.260 --> 46:23.410
that Peugeot should make
this sudden swerve

46:23.460 --> 46:27.650
from building dependable workhorses
to exciting, sporty cars

46:27.700 --> 46:29.450
like the 205 GTi.

46:29.500 --> 46:32.250
And nor is it surprising, given
the quality of their steel

46:32.300 --> 46:34.010
and their grinders and their corsets

46:34.060 --> 46:35.890
and their bicycles
and their munitions,

46:35.940 --> 46:39.180
that they were
unbelievably good at it.

46:43.540 --> 46:48.170
A turbo-charged four-wheel drive
version of the 205 called the T16

46:48.220 --> 46:51.340
won 16 rounds of the
Rally Championship...

46:54.700 --> 46:59.010
.. beating the might
of Ford, Audi and Lancia

46:59.060 --> 47:01.940
with two back-to-back world titles.

47:04.580 --> 47:05.730
And back in the showroom,

47:05.780 --> 47:08.290
the sporty cars kept on coming.

47:08.340 --> 47:10.380
Peugeot was on a roll.

47:12.060 --> 47:17.050
But then one day, in Paris,
there was a meeting.

47:22.180 --> 47:23.940
~ Messieurs...
~ Mm?

47:25.060 --> 47:28.730
The time has come for us to
stop making this sporty car.

47:28.780 --> 47:31.820
~ Mon Dieu!
~ Sacre bleu!

47:33.300 --> 47:36.170
But what shall nous do instead?

47:36.220 --> 47:39.610
Er... coat hangers? Umbrellas?

47:39.660 --> 47:42.220
How is zees for a plan?

47:43.540 --> 47:45.810
We make terrible cars,

47:45.860 --> 47:48.850
in every way 'orrible.

47:48.900 --> 47:50.850
Maybe tres ugly!

47:50.900 --> 47:52.130
Oh, oui, oui, oui!

47:52.180 --> 47:54.930
And le engine tres 'orrible.

47:54.980 --> 47:58.930
Oh, nasty, unreliable, uncomfortable.

47:58.980 --> 48:02.210
Et l'interior fabrique
en... spit et Kleenex.

48:02.260 --> 48:05.490
~ Spit et Kleenex. Oui, oui, oui!
~ Oui, oui, oui!

48:05.540 --> 48:09.170
C'est une bonne idee,
n'est-ce pas? Oui?

48:09.220 --> 48:13.250
Ne regardez pas un cadeau
de cheval dans la bouche.

48:13.300 --> 48:17.370
Messieurs, salut la voiture horrible!

48:17.420 --> 48:20.050
Ohhhh!

48:20.100 --> 48:22.130
And get the chef de
suspension up here

48:22.180 --> 48:24.090
so we can fire him immediatement.

48:24.140 --> 48:25.370
Oh, yes.

48:25.420 --> 48:28.170
This breakfast meeting will
put Peugeot on the map

48:28.220 --> 48:31.260
for many years to come
- make no mistake.

48:33.100 --> 48:35.090
This is what resulted -

48:35.140 --> 48:38.050
cars like the hateful 1007,

48:38.100 --> 48:40.250
the absurd 407,

48:40.300 --> 48:41.650
the woeful 607,

48:41.700 --> 48:45.130
and the shockingly bad 3008 -

48:45.180 --> 48:51.290
cheaply made, sloppy handling,
lacklustre dung, the lot of it.

48:53.140 --> 48:55.050
The adverts changed, too.

48:55.100 --> 48:59.330
Out went the burning cornfields
and the jumping 205s,

48:59.380 --> 49:01.820
and in came tosh like this...

49:03.300 --> 49:05.930
Buy a car, four wheels and some seats

49:05.980 --> 49:07.410
for just £99 a month

49:07.460 --> 49:10.610
with £1,000 cashback plus
another £2,000 cashback.

49:10.660 --> 49:13.250
Easy finance and a free - yes, free -

49:13.300 --> 49:15.440
locking petrol filler cap!

49:16.660 --> 49:19.010
APR 29.4%. Subject to
terms and conditions.

49:19.060 --> 49:21.050
You must be able to sign
your name to have a car.

49:21.100 --> 49:25.000
Your knees may be at risk if
you do not keep up repayments.

49:26.340 --> 49:28.770
The results were immediate.

49:28.820 --> 49:31.250
Sales went through the roof.

49:31.300 --> 49:35.250
Peugeot may have been good at making
sturdy cars and sporty cars,

49:35.300 --> 49:41.370
but it seemed they were absolutely
brilliant at making terrible cars.

49:41.420 --> 49:43.810
Yes. And to find out
just how brilliant,

49:43.860 --> 49:45.970
Jeremy and I are going
to do an experiment.

49:46.020 --> 49:49.930
He has bought this mildly
fire-damaged 307 CC.

49:49.980 --> 49:51.890
You can see where the
fire was just here.

49:51.940 --> 49:53.890
It's out now, so that's OK.

49:53.940 --> 49:55.050
Good. Yes.

49:55.100 --> 49:58.930
And I have bought this
utterly dreary 407.

49:58.980 --> 50:01.330
And now, we're going to test them

50:01.380 --> 50:04.980
as if we're not interested
in cars at all.

50:08.460 --> 50:11.090
In these horrible cars,
it didn't take us long

50:11.140 --> 50:14.810
to get the hang of being
modern Peugeot drivers.

50:21.020 --> 50:22.360
Maniac!

50:24.860 --> 50:27.300
And...turn...

50:31.260 --> 50:36.650
Why oh why do those idiots
on Top Gear criticise Peugeot?

50:36.700 --> 50:39.810
I mean, look, six-speed gear box.

50:39.860 --> 50:41.570
This is particularly brilliant -

50:41.620 --> 50:44.610
you've got your light switch
here, off, and then here,

50:44.660 --> 50:46.330
especially off.

50:50.820 --> 50:55.690
So two... two-and-a-half
revs, another gear...

50:57.660 --> 51:00.200
Oh, no, you're supposed to press...

51:02.300 --> 51:03.770
That's it.

51:07.100 --> 51:09.980
Soon, James had an accident.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.010
Damn and blast.

51:18.740 --> 51:20.140
Oh, dear.

51:20.980 --> 51:22.980
Oh, dear, dear, dear...

51:32.060 --> 51:35.130
~ You crashed again?
~ Yeah.

51:35.180 --> 51:37.290
Didn't you crash on this
corner this morning?

51:37.340 --> 51:39.690
Yeah. I haven't got
round it once yet.

51:39.740 --> 51:42.610
It is tricky. I don't know
why they put corners on...

51:42.660 --> 51:44.090
I mean, why would you?

51:44.140 --> 51:45.890
Well, I was going quite fast.

51:45.940 --> 51:47.010
I was in third.

51:47.060 --> 51:48.260
Oh!

51:49.420 --> 51:52.330
While James's car was being
towed out of the ditch,

51:52.380 --> 51:54.530
I took the opportunity to demonstrate

51:54.580 --> 51:57.820
yet another incredible standard
feature on my car.

51:58.900 --> 52:00.930
If you want to lower
the passenger window,

52:00.980 --> 52:04.380
you can do that from a switch
on the driver's door.

52:05.340 --> 52:09.410
But if you want to get it
back up again... you can't.

52:09.460 --> 52:13.690
So, you have to go round
to the other side, OK,

52:13.740 --> 52:16.330
and use the button here.

52:16.380 --> 52:23.170
But, if you do that, you're going
to trap your arm in this gap here.

52:23.220 --> 52:26.290
Now, Peugeot's thought of that, OK?
Obviously, you can't open this door.

52:26.340 --> 52:28.610
There's no door lock, that's
for security reasons.

52:28.660 --> 52:34.090
So you pop back round here
- and this is incredible -

52:34.140 --> 52:37.610
simply pull this switch, OK?

52:37.660 --> 52:39.730
Windows ALL go down now.

52:40.980 --> 52:43.500
The roof detaches, and now...

52:44.900 --> 52:48.850
Now look - I can lift the window

52:48.900 --> 52:52.570
without getting my arm trapped.

52:52.620 --> 52:55.220
Can you see? Brilliant.

52:58.860 --> 53:00.690
With James's car out of the ditch,

53:00.740 --> 53:04.620
we relaxed by tuning
in to Radio Peugeot.

53:06.140 --> 53:08.490
Jeremy Vine, BBC Radio 2.

53:08.540 --> 53:10.890
"Is Britain full?" is
how we started this.

53:10.940 --> 53:13.490
Alison in Warfield in
Berkshire texts and says,

53:13.540 --> 53:15.610
"I can't park at Waitrose.

53:15.660 --> 53:17.770
"So, yes, we are too full."

53:17.820 --> 53:19.420
Good caller.

53:23.340 --> 53:26.250
That's very nice of him. He just
gave me a little push there

53:26.300 --> 53:28.840
to let me know he was coming past.

53:30.900 --> 53:32.570
Corner! Corner!

53:45.380 --> 53:47.450
I've done it. I'm round.

53:49.940 --> 53:53.050
Despite the soothing tones
of Radio Peugeot...

53:53.100 --> 53:56.090
Do you think you may have the
worst-tasting water in Britain?

53:56.140 --> 53:57.970
Do call us if so - 0500 288 291...

53:58.020 --> 54:00.490
.. we found the journey
very stressful

54:00.540 --> 54:03.140
thanks to badly placed road signs...

54:06.060 --> 54:08.060
.. and busy junctions.

54:09.300 --> 54:10.640
Maniac.

54:11.460 --> 54:12.800
Maniac.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.970
Maniac.

54:15.020 --> 54:16.530
Yobbo.

54:16.580 --> 54:17.810
Maniac.

54:17.860 --> 54:20.860
Mani... oh, hold on, I think
there's a chance here.

54:23.540 --> 54:26.010
Ohhh... damn it!

54:26.060 --> 54:28.410
You've got Johnny Foreigner
coming over here,

54:28.460 --> 54:30.600
they don't pay a penny...

54:35.060 --> 54:38.060
Bloody council not mending
the bloody roads.

54:42.780 --> 54:45.250
James, there's a corner
coming up, a corner.

54:45.300 --> 54:48.380
There's a sign saying, "corner".
Do take care this time, OK?

54:52.580 --> 54:55.730
To be honest, I didn't notice
James's latest accident

54:55.780 --> 55:00.130
because I'd found yet another
feature in my amazing car.

55:00.180 --> 55:04.650
If I push this button here that
increases the temperature,

55:04.700 --> 55:08.050
and then hold it down
for a little while...

55:08.100 --> 55:10.610
There we go.

55:10.660 --> 55:14.650
Lovely, lovely. Mm-mm, smoke!

55:14.700 --> 55:17.370
Obviously, there's a fair bit of
choking you have to go through,

55:17.420 --> 55:19.940
but, um... look at the result!

55:21.460 --> 55:25.690
People like a... a real
fire in their homes.

55:25.740 --> 55:27.740
I've got one in my car.

55:28.940 --> 55:31.170
It's a good job this
car has a chimney.

55:31.220 --> 55:34.220
Obviously, that's a very
good design feature.

55:35.940 --> 55:37.770
When I met up with James again,

55:37.820 --> 55:41.610
it was at the Peugeot driver's
worst nightmare -

55:41.660 --> 55:43.980
a double mini-roundabout.

55:46.860 --> 55:48.130
Now...

55:55.140 --> 55:57.540
Dear God. Right, that's clear...

56:13.780 --> 56:15.380
I don't know.

56:19.140 --> 56:20.500
It's...

56:33.820 --> 56:35.160
Maniac!

56:40.220 --> 56:44.100
Oh, God - no more double
mini-roundabouts ever, please.

56:46.100 --> 56:48.170
After such a terrifying ordeal,

56:48.220 --> 56:51.530
we needed hot sweet tea
to calm our nerves,

56:51.580 --> 56:54.220
so we went to a nearby garden centre.

56:55.380 --> 56:58.610
Will Hull e-mails, "I suggest
we bring back workhouses.

56:58.660 --> 57:00.810
"That would deter people
exploiting the state

57:00.860 --> 57:04.010
~ "and having as many children as they want."
~ A space there, nearly.

57:04.060 --> 57:05.460
Entrance?

57:14.980 --> 57:17.320
I'll have to come in forwards.

57:33.260 --> 57:36.020
A cup of tea. Ooh... perfect.

57:48.980 --> 57:51.010
~ Have you seen this, James?
~ What?

57:51.060 --> 57:55.250
~ Carrots stop you getting cancer.
~ Really?
~ Yeah.

57:55.300 --> 57:57.090
But The Mail said it
was toma... tomatoes.

57:57.140 --> 58:00.010
Or was it tomatoes give you cancer?

58:00.060 --> 58:03.970
I thought Diana gave you cancer.
Or was it house prices?

58:04.020 --> 58:06.450
No, immigrants do house pr...

58:06.500 --> 58:08.370
Oh, I get confused.

58:08.420 --> 58:12.060
'Afternoon tea over, we
got back on the road.'

58:19.740 --> 58:21.080
Maniac!

58:23.780 --> 58:26.010
After a busy day, we
were heading home,

58:26.060 --> 58:28.450
and to get there,
we'd fitted our cars

58:28.500 --> 58:32.210
with something called
"satellite navigation".

58:32.260 --> 58:35.890
Incredible device. It was
a present from my children.

58:35.940 --> 58:41.290
It knows where I am on the planet
and then it can get me to my house.

58:41.340 --> 58:43.740
All I have to do is as I'm told.

58:44.460 --> 58:48.940
So I go left here... yes...

58:50.540 --> 58:54.380
Right, according to the
electric map, I go right.

58:56.660 --> 58:58.260
This is, um...

58:59.620 --> 59:01.890
.. overgrown - the council
should really do something

59:01.940 --> 59:03.880
about this road here.

59:05.100 --> 59:07.410
It's weird, isn't it? You
hear stories all the time

59:07.460 --> 59:11.370
about idiots who, "Oh, I was following
the satellite navigation

59:11.420 --> 59:13.690
"and I drove off a cliff
or into a canal",

59:13.740 --> 59:16.080
and you think, "What a moron!"

59:20.540 --> 59:24.100
Must be a shortcut. Bloody clever.

59:28.860 --> 59:32.730
And here we are. Home sweet home!

59:32.780 --> 59:35.060
Ah, joy!

59:37.860 --> 59:40.370
So, there we are - Peugeot.

59:40.420 --> 59:43.450
They were brilliant
at making strong cars.

59:43.500 --> 59:45.730
They were brilliant
at making sporty cars,

59:45.780 --> 59:47.210
and for the last decade,

59:47.260 --> 59:51.010
they have been brilliant
at making terrible cars.

59:51.060 --> 59:57.010
This really is THE perfect car
for the world's imperfect drivers.

59:57.060 --> 59:59.890
"The simple way to stop speeding
is to hand a jail sentence

59:59.940 --> 01:00:02.130
"to anyone who's caught
breaking the speed limit,

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.170
"and that will sort the problem."

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.360
Jenny in Ramsgate, Kent...

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.650
But here's the worry.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.090
Soon, it will be time for Peugeot
to change its mind again

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.810
and think of something new.

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.730
And who knows what that'll be.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.180
Knowing Peugeot, it could be...

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.380
.. a type of inert gas.

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.370
The Peugeot nine-piece
Rhythm and Blues band.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.290
Only time will tell.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.330
Really?

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:44.730
Worst thing ever on Top
Gear, the choking -

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.010
I've never, never ever
had anything worse

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.290
than being choked to
death in a car on fire.

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.330
~ Hang on.
~ What?
~ Hang on a minute.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:56.490
Are you two saying that Peugeot
have spent ten years

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.970
deliberately making terrible cars?

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:03.250
~ Mm.
~ Well, yeah - you can't make cars
that consistently bad by accident.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:05.290
No, think about it, Hammond,
think about it.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.130
What is the point of making a car

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.330
with complicated brakes
and expensive suspension

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.170
if you're just going
to sell it to someone

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.570
who only wants Jeremy
Vine and easy finance?

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.930
Exactly - you make cars
as cheaply as possible

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.890
and then sell them to
people who won't notice.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.890
I mean, think of it this way,
OK? Right now, even as we speak,

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:24.970
nine million people in Britain
are so uninterested in cars,

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.330
they're watching that Midwife
thing on the other side.

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.890
And you're saying they're
all Peugeot drivers?

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.730
Yes, I am, and they're all going
to be absolutely heartbroken

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:36.180
when Peugeot starts making cows.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.010
And on that bombshell,
it's time to end.

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:42.020
Thank you so much for watching.
See you next week. Good night!
