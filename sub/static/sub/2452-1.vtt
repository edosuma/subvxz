   In every group of friends,

14:20.327 --> 14:21.492
              Go.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.494
 No, no, you can't hug me, no!

14:23.496 --> 14:24.796
              Oh!

14:24.798 --> 14:26.197
   You mean he still had a--
            - Boner!

14:26.199 --> 14:28.833
              Oh!
       - A raging boner.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.702
    So it was less of a hug
    and more of a dry hump.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.738
       He was practically
         inside of her,
      for crying out loud.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.807
  So she dumped me, naturally.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.642
 She said if I'm still friends
          with Barry,

14:37.644 --> 14:39.644
  I'm practically as juvenile
           as he is.

14:39.646 --> 14:40.678
          Sorry, bud.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.880
   It doesn't matter anymore.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.681
    Guys, I know we've been
       friends with Barry

14:43.683 --> 14:47.185
  since before we hit puberty,
           but, um...

14:47.187 --> 14:48.653
          I'm over it.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.754
         I am over it.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.689
   I mean the dude's heart's
      in the right place,

14:51.691 --> 14:53.992
    but, let's face it, man,
        he is a menace.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.094
    I mean when we were kids
         it was great,

14:56.096 --> 14:57.362
       yeah, it was fun.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.763
       We're adults now.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.331
 We're trying to have families

15:00.333 --> 15:03.334
          and careers
    and relationships, Kurt,

15:03.336 --> 15:05.837
    and Barry's making that
          impossible.

15:06.872 --> 15:08.907
      It's his Barryisms.
     - What are you sayin'?

15:08.909 --> 15:11.209
        I'm saying that
   we'll always love the guy,

15:11.211 --> 15:13.778
     but... we cannot live
       with him anymore.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.613
      Yeah, but I mean...

15:15.615 --> 15:17.181
  Barry's always there for us.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.616
   Yeah, that's the problem.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.119
       He's always there
    screwing everything up.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.121
    He's a real ragamuffin.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.191
       What if we were to
        get rid of him?

15:27.193 --> 15:29.761
        [clears throat]
            Okay...

15:29.763 --> 15:31.696
         I think I get
      what you're saying.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.865
      I just wanna clarify
           something.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.934
     I can't kill someone.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.869
   I can't. But I wanna help.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.137
        I'll dig the...

15:40.239 --> 15:42.073
          I'll dig it.
I don't want to, but I'll do it.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.808
    We're not talking about
      murdering him, Hurt.

15:43.810 --> 15:44.876
    That's not on the table.
         - I knew that.

15:44.878 --> 15:47.578
 Everyone was- was hashing it-
            it out.

15:47.580 --> 15:48.713
    So what, do you want to
          disown him?

15:48.715 --> 15:49.914
  No, no, that wouldn't work.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.050
   He'd just keep coming back
  like a zombie or something.

15:52.052 --> 15:52.951
   So, like an intervention?

15:52.953 --> 15:54.319
       No. He'd relapse.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.588
   No, dude, this- this- this
       requires something

15:57.590 --> 15:59.324
       far more stealthy,

15:59.326 --> 16:03.895
       I'm talking about
     making someone else...

16:03.897 --> 16:05.530
       ...deal with him.

16:06.231 --> 16:08.099
        Okay. All right.

16:08.101 --> 16:11.069
So we, uh, we hire someone else
         to whack him.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.805
    That way we're not even
    connected to the murder.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.107
We're gettin' away hands clean.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.809
We go down to Mexico, chill out,

16:17.811 --> 16:19.677
    drinkin', smokin' weed.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.513
      I maybe get addicted
  to heroin, but that's cool.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.283
     I'm not talking about
   whacking him, Ray Liotta.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.918
            [scoffs]

16:27.553 --> 16:28.820
           Obviously.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.656
See, what we need isn't someone
   who can put up with Barry,

16:31.658 --> 16:34.192
    what we need is someone
 who has to put up with Barry.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.960
       The type of person
     who has to put up with

16:35.962 --> 16:39.464
     a never-ending stream
     of infantile behavior

16:39.466 --> 16:40.765
    twenty-four hours a day,

16:40.767 --> 16:43.768
       seven days a week
     for their entire life.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.769
          A therapist?

16:44.771 --> 16:46.170
            A wife.
            - Wife.
           - A wife!

16:46.172 --> 16:48.206
       Yeah, pop-pop-pop!
    [makes explosion sound]

16:48.208 --> 16:50.141
             Yeah!
            - Yeah!

16:50.143 --> 16:51.809
  You were locked in a closet
           as a kid.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.945
I mean he's always talkin' about
    he wants to meet someone

16:53.947 --> 16:54.779
         anyway, right?

16:54.781 --> 16:55.847
We'd just be doing him a favor.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.148
           I like it.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.716
         Scratch that,
           I love it.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.284
      I don't know, guys.
      I mean, I need him.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.352
  What are you talking' about,
             Rafe?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.988
     I mean he babysits JT
     every Saturday night.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.323
  That's my prime date night.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.656
In fact, he's with him right now

17:06.659 --> 17:08.726
        so I can go meet
 the funeral director at nine.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.127
     Yes, that's happening.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.162
        Hand over fist.
       - Don't catch it.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.997
      It's hand over fist.
       - No, make a fist.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.464
       I don't like that.
            - Yeah.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.000
   Lemme ask you a question,
             Rafe.

17:16.002 --> 17:19.503
When, um Barry's babysitting JT

17:19.506 --> 17:21.039
    what exactly do they do?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.839
         I don't know.
   They have a blast, though.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.976
     They play video games,
         watch movies.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.145
   Well, uh, looks like Barry
          just posted

17:27.146 --> 17:28.646
  what they're actually doing.

17:29.748 --> 17:31.883
       Okay, kid, throw,
      throw, throw, throw.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.418
    Go! Run, run, run, run,
           run, run!

17:33.420 --> 17:35.119
          [explosion]
        [JT] Holy shit!

17:36.055 --> 17:36.821
        Let's marry off
          this fucker.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.557
  Why are you guys so keen on
    finding me a girlfriend

17:39.559 --> 17:40.324
        all of a sudden?

17:40.326 --> 17:42.260
    Pals forever, remember?
            - Yeah.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.528
   Just want you to be happy.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.695
        Yeah, man, plus
      you're such a catch

17:44.697 --> 17:46.364
      it's a total mystery
    how you're still single.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.932
           It's true.
 - No, I don't know about that.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.500
  Listen, guys, I promise you,

17:49.502 --> 17:51.702
   I'm gonna put my best foot
      forward today, okay?

17:51.704 --> 17:52.537
           Cool, man.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.339
      Bring on the vagina.
           Huh! Huh!

17:56.575 --> 17:57.909
           All right.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.243
          [bell rings]

18:01.413 --> 18:04.282
      [man] Okay everyone,
       let's have a seat!

18:04.284 --> 18:05.883
              Hi.
        Hi, I'm Leslie.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.185
         Hi, I'm Barry.
             - Hi.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.753
           [laughing]
              Hi.

18:08.755 --> 18:09.954
             Next!

18:09.956 --> 18:11.289
           Excuse me?
            - Next.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.524
     Barry, that's not how
      speed dating works.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.926
  I'm not feelin' it with her.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.394
      Are you kidding me?
       Is he kidding me?

18:16.396 --> 18:19.130
     Listen, no matter what
        you're feeling--

18:19.132 --> 18:21.032
   I'm not feeling anything.
      That's the problem.

18:21.034 --> 18:23.968
   You're- you're beautiful,
     we're just, you know,

18:23.970 --> 18:25.269
      we don't have... it.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.637
        You have to wait
   until they ring the bell.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.941
 The bell? I gotta talk to her
  for the whole five minutes?

18:29.943 --> 18:30.641
             Yeah.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.642
  I'm sitting across from you.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.277
  I hear the words coming out
         of your mouth.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.379
 Look, if it's any consolation,
     he's always like this.

18:35.381 --> 18:37.048
             Yeah.
         - Nice shirt.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.416
          Do not- hey!

18:38.418 --> 18:39.717
        Do not make fun
         of my friends.

18:39.719 --> 18:40.885
           Fuck you!
          - What? I--

18:40.887 --> 18:43.454
         What did I do?
   I have to live with this!

18:43.456 --> 18:45.223
            [sighs]
    Quite the mouth on her.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.991
  She's got some anger issues.

18:46.993 --> 18:50.261
   Barry, Barry. Listen to me
   very carefully, all right?

18:50.263 --> 18:53.064
   When you meet these women,
 whatever comes to your mind...

18:53.066 --> 18:54.765
             Yeah?
     - ...say the opposite.

18:54.767 --> 18:55.967
            Got it.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.768
   Ah, yeah, backwards town.
            Got it.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.971
          Yeah, yeah,
     that looks super real.

18:59.973 --> 19:03.074
      That shirt does not
    give off the impression

19:03.076 --> 19:04.976
that you own several stray dogs.

19:04.978 --> 19:05.510
             [ding]

19:05.512 --> 19:09.280
         Jesus Christ!
 You scared the shit outta me.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.182
         I mean, uh...

19:11.184 --> 19:15.520
 You do not look like a cutter
            at all.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.488
        It's even harder
        than we thought.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.991
     It's time to bring out
         the big guns.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.627
       So, Mister Goker,

19:22.629 --> 19:24.629
   how does this exactly, um,
             work?

19:24.631 --> 19:26.998
   Well, the brides obviously
    don't come in the mail,

19:27.000 --> 19:30.935
    but, uh, they do come in
 a very small crate on a boat,

19:30.937 --> 19:35.206
  and we, of course, make sure
  to poke the holes in the box

19:35.208 --> 19:37.008
      so they can breathe.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.510
         Keep it human.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.511
             Oh...

19:42.014 --> 19:44.882
          I'm kidding!
         [all laughing]

19:44.884 --> 19:46.184
   We don't put 'em in a box!

19:46.186 --> 19:48.052
   What are we, monsters? No!

19:48.054 --> 19:50.588
       Just a very small,
        dangerous boat.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.224
   So I guess you're the man
     with all the bitches.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.992
         Okay... bitch?

19:54.994 --> 19:57.328
   Okay, I gotta ask you guys
     a question right now.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.197
         Do you, uh...

19:59.199 --> 20:01.132
   ...do you guys hate women?

20:01.134 --> 20:02.833
       No, I love women.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.702
   Because I don't sell women

20:04.704 --> 20:07.872
     to men who hate women.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.074
    We do not sell bitches!

20:10.076 --> 20:11.342
           If we did,

20:11.344 --> 20:15.012
         it'd be called
  Goker's Mail Order Bitches!

20:15.014 --> 20:18.716
 Not Goker's Mail Order Brides!

20:18.718 --> 20:20.084
             Okay?

20:20.086 --> 20:23.721
 Uh, yeah, it was- it was just
    a slang term, you know.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.158
I'm just gonna put it out there.

20:27.160 --> 20:31.195
 Um, I'm not- I'm not- I'm not
       actually looking,

20:31.197 --> 20:32.096
         is that okay?

20:32.098 --> 20:33.030
             Yeah.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.365
        I am not looking
       to marry anybody,

20:34.367 --> 20:35.566
    maybe just a girlfriend.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.102
    Unless she's like super,
       super-duper cool,

20:38.104 --> 20:38.869
          then maybe.

           to try it
    with one of these women

   that manhole cover myself

         Did you fart?

28:39.819 --> 28:42.086
     No. I've been trying.

28:42.088 --> 28:43.587
     Yeah, 'cause I farted
      right when we got in

28:43.589 --> 28:44.988
   and that is not my brand.

28:46.157 --> 28:48.258
         It's pathetic.
    I can't smell anything.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.927
      What, you don't have
   a sense of smell you mean?

28:49.929 --> 28:51.595
   It's just a terrible fart.

28:51.597 --> 28:53.731
   Oh, you're calling my fart
           pathetic?

28:53.733 --> 28:54.565
              Yes.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.434
      Well, we're dealing
     with a new issue here.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.603
     The issue is that you
      apparently have gas

28:59.605 --> 29:00.537
    and it's gonna come out

29:00.539 --> 29:02.272
         at some point
     during this cab ride.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.074
      Trust me, I hope so.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.275
            [sighs]

29:08.413 --> 29:09.847
            [grunts]
            Nothing.

29:12.617 --> 29:14.418
    [both heckle the driver
       at the same time]

29:14.420 --> 29:15.619
   It's called the way there.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.721
    [both heckle the driver]

29:17.723 --> 29:19.389
           Assholes.
          - Hey what?

29:19.391 --> 29:20.758
     Watch it, you wanker.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.459
  Eat my dick, you fuck face.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.294
          Fuck mouth.
       - Paying customer!

29:24.296 --> 29:25.462
      Fucking cock breath.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.431
           [laughing]
         Cock breath...

29:27.433 --> 29:29.166
     Oh, that's impressive.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.435
      Oh, thanks, you too.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.536
           Thank you.

29:32.538 --> 29:33.971
   My friends would disagree

29:33.973 --> 29:36.373
    and they think my mouth
     is my biggest problem.

29:39.644 --> 29:42.146
I think its fine, you just have-
    you just have thin lips.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.480
            No- not-

29:43.482 --> 29:45.616
   No, wha- the things I say,
not what my lips look like, no.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.084
         Oh, oh, right.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.285
    I know I have thin lips.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.354
      It's- it's the bane
        of my existence.

29:51.724 --> 29:56.093
  Loads of guys have dumped me
  because they're embarrassed.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.761
         I don't know.
          - Oh, dicks.

29:57.763 --> 29:58.662
         I don't care.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.799
       It's my roommate,
she's always trying to set me up

30:01.801 --> 30:03.267
     and find me a husband.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.468
     No, tell me about it.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.137
 My- my friends just bought me
            a wife.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.772
         They bought--?

30:08.774 --> 30:10.674
     They bought me a wife,
     like out of the blue.

30:10.676 --> 30:12.109
      So, you're married?

30:12.111 --> 30:14.311
       N-no, may- maybe.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.612
         I don't know.

30:15.614 --> 30:17.314
        I- I don't think
    it was legally binding.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.148
         I'm not sure.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.650
      I-I'll have to check
          on that one.

30:22.086 --> 30:23.754
        What do you do?

30:23.756 --> 30:25.756
           Um, I work
   for the parks department.

30:25.758 --> 30:27.758
           The what?
      - Parks department.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.459
        Pox department?
            - Parks.

30:29.461 --> 30:30.327
             Parks?
            - Parks.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.528
           Oh, parks!
       Parks department.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.297
         Right, right,
     the parks department.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.131
            Got it.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.365
       Well that's cool.

30:35.367 --> 30:36.500
       It is really cool.

30:36.502 --> 30:37.534
     Wanna know what I do?

30:37.536 --> 30:38.836
          Not really.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.604
      C'mon, take a guess,
        it's a good one.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.839
        Um, unemployed?
             - Yes!

30:41.841 --> 30:43.307
        Very good guess.

30:43.309 --> 30:44.875
    Be honest, do you think
     it was inappropriate?

30:44.877 --> 30:47.144
   For you to talk about your
   own feminine hygiene issue

30:47.146 --> 30:48.111
      at your dinner date?

30:48.113 --> 30:49.680
        Absolutely not.
          - Thank you.

30:49.682 --> 30:50.948
    Why would that be weird?
           - I know!

30:50.950 --> 30:52.783
       I didn't think so,
     but then I was, like,

30:52.785 --> 30:53.784
      questioning myself.

30:53.786 --> 30:54.785
       People are weird!
            - Yeah.

30:54.787 --> 30:56.653
     Like my date, my wife,

30:56.655 --> 30:57.888
walked out on our date tonight,

30:57.890 --> 31:00.357
   I think, because I talked
        about my balls.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.692
            [scoffs]
         Like one time.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.894
    She sounds like a twunt.

31:03.896 --> 31:04.962
             What?

31:04.964 --> 31:06.063
           I'm sorry.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.531
   That's a really ugly word,
             I'm--

31:07.533 --> 31:08.532
     No, no, no, that's not
         what I meant.

31:08.534 --> 31:09.867
            Did you?

31:09.869 --> 31:11.268
          I say twunt.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.805
       I... No you don't.

31:14.807 --> 31:16.874
   I say twunt all the time.

31:19.811 --> 31:22.679
    I thought I made it up.
   - I thought I made it up.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.548
     Well, I guess we both
          made it up.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.749
        I guess we did.

31:25.751 --> 31:27.684
    Oh my God, I love twunt,
         I love twunt!

31:27.686 --> 31:29.553
       Oh, I love twunt.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.855
         I love twunt.
        - I love twunt.

31:31.857 --> 31:35.192
       [Scottish accent]
       Oh, look at that,
        you great twunt.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.828
 [both using Scottish accents]
             Oh no!
        - Oh you twunt.

31:37.830 --> 31:38.929
 I can't do a Scottish accent.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.831
     Oh, you stinky twunt.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.032
         Listen to you!

31:42.034 --> 31:43.433
        [unintelligible]

31:43.435 --> 31:45.769
        [Indian accent]
Would you like some twunt korma?

31:45.771 --> 31:47.504
   Buttered- buttered twunt?

31:47.506 --> 31:51.341
         [normal voice]
   And, no, I don't know why
  people react to me that way.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.242
        I really don't.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.745
    It's just I prefer to be
        honest because--

31:54.747 --> 31:56.880
  Everyone wastes so much time
          being polite

31:56.882 --> 31:59.016
    when they could just say
        what they mean.

31:59.018 --> 32:02.386
   Now the question you gotta
       ask yourself is...

32:02.388 --> 32:05.055
   "Do you feel lucky, twunt?

32:05.057 --> 32:07.791
         Well? Do ya?"

32:07.793 --> 32:09.860
   No, I got, it was too big
  at the end, but you get it.

32:09.862 --> 32:10.861
             Yeah.

32:10.863 --> 32:13.397
         That was good.
     That was really good.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.499
        [both laughing]

32:17.468 --> 32:18.535
       Yeah, here you go.

32:18.537 --> 32:19.803
     Door-to-door service.

32:19.805 --> 32:21.905
   Thanks, that would almost
         be chivalrous,

32:21.907 --> 32:23.707
       if you didn't just
     arm-wrestle me for it.

32:23.709 --> 32:26.743
     Well, I have something
  very pressing to do at home.

32:26.745 --> 32:27.811
          Masturbate?

32:27.813 --> 32:29.413
             Yeah.
           - Me too.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.781
        [both giggling]

32:30.783 --> 32:31.882
        Man, get a room.

32:31.884 --> 32:34.151
  Just shut your stupid face!

32:34.153 --> 32:35.285
           [giggling]

32:35.287 --> 32:36.920
      Seriously, shut your
          stupid face.

32:36.922 --> 32:37.888
         Y'all twunts.

32:37.890 --> 32:39.589
             Well--
            [coughs]

32:39.591 --> 32:42.426
     I got a- I got a burp
         in my throat.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.794
          Let it rip.

32:43.796 --> 32:44.461
          [small burp]

32:44.463 --> 32:46.163
          Nice. Nice.
            - Yeah.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.764
        I hate this job.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.633
             Um...
            [laughs]

32:49.635 --> 32:51.635
          Okay, um...

32:51.637 --> 32:53.170
            Goodbye.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.472
            Goodbye.
           - See you.

32:56.674 --> 32:58.775
     I'll pay for the cab.
          Don't worry.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.277
     Always planned on it.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.079
         Hey! Hey, hey.

33:03.081 --> 33:05.115
 You are not as big of a bitch

33:05.117 --> 33:06.883
as I thought you were gonna be.

33:08.286 --> 33:09.152
            Thanks.

33:09.487 --> 33:10.988
             Yeah.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.757
     You're not as big of a
          cheese-dick,

33:13.759 --> 33:15.325
Well, you haven't seen my dick.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.259
          [both laugh]

33:16.261 --> 33:18.128
             Um...
      - What's your name?

33:18.130 --> 33:20.797
    Oh, God, yeah, I'm Mel-
        I'm Mel Miller.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.166
        Mel- M- Mel- M-
      I'm Melanie Miller.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.202
        I'm Barry Burke.
      - Barry Burke, hey.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.436
         How do you do?

33:26.438 --> 33:28.872
           I do well.
             Um...

33:28.874 --> 33:32.009
    Maybe I'll run into you
     some time, Mel Miller.

33:32.011 --> 33:34.878
  Maybe we will, Barry Burke.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.947
         [both chuckle]

33:38.116 --> 33:39.883
         Goodbye again.

33:39.885 --> 33:41.151
           [giggling]

33:41.153 --> 33:44.021
        Okay, goodnight.
          - Yeah, bye.

33:45.289 --> 33:46.556
            [sighs]

34:06.044 --> 34:07.244
            [sighs]

34:07.246 --> 34:08.045
      [knock on the door]

34:08.047 --> 34:08.978
              Hey.

34:08.981 --> 34:10.080
           Hey, babe.

34:11.014 --> 34:12.382
       This museum pitch
         is killing me.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.650
    I have like zero ideas.
           - Mm-hmm.

34:14.652 --> 34:17.853
 So I thought I would just come
   and take a little break...

34:17.856 --> 34:19.589
           With you.

34:23.860 --> 34:24.895
              Pow.

34:27.264 --> 34:28.565
           [whispers]
              Pow.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.967
             Pshew.

34:33.905 --> 34:34.971
              Ow.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.244
             Do do.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.647
     Choo ch-choo, ch-choo

35:00.064 --> 35:01.631
              Aah!

35:01.633 --> 35:03.800
I'm just gonna do some exercises

35:03.802 --> 35:06.403
     to help me, you know,
         clear my head.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.871
             Um...

35:07.873 --> 35:09.606
 I do this in my pilates class.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.041
         Isn't it fun?

35:11.043 --> 35:12.576
         Can I get my--

35:12.578 --> 35:15.779
You're gonna wrinkle up my stuff
          on my desk.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.615
 Babe, I'm- I'm really trying'
    to get some stuff done,

35:18.617 --> 35:19.282
     you know what I mean?

35:19.284 --> 35:20.550
   You can't do it tomorrow?

35:20.552 --> 35:21.785
     Ah, you know, I could.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.053
      I'd just rather not.

35:23.055 --> 35:23.987
            [sighs]

35:28.426 --> 35:29.993
         Mm- mm- babe.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.963
  Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga
           choo choo!

35:32.965 --> 35:35.065
     Honey, I'm tryin' to--

35:37.902 --> 35:39.102
             Babe.

35:39.104 --> 35:41.705
        No one's hiring,
     I have to focus, okay?

35:45.510 --> 35:46.977
           I'm sorry.

35:50.448 --> 35:51.648
        I miss that guy.

35:51.650 --> 35:52.849
           What guy?

36:08.132 --> 36:09.266
          [whispering]
           That guy.

36:12.136 --> 36:14.171
     We all miss that guy.

36:15.339 --> 36:16.740
       What in the world?

36:18.976 --> 36:20.911
        [keys clacking]

36:24.782 --> 36:26.116
           God damn.

36:29.987 --> 36:31.154
            Barry...

36:31.156 --> 36:33.123
       I think it's time
   to face the fact that you-

36:33.125 --> 36:34.124
           that, uh-

36:34.959 --> 36:35.659
             That-

36:35.661 --> 36:38.128
       What was I saying?
        - Are you high?

36:38.130 --> 36:39.062
      [blows raspberries]

36:39.064 --> 36:40.997
      Yeah, like I'd find
        a year-old blunt

36:40.999 --> 36:43.500
   and smoke that and, like,
    cough so hard I farted.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.035
     Like I did that. Yeah.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.002
           He's high!
         - You're high!

36:46.004 --> 36:47.304
     Yeah, I'm high, yeah.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.538
  I am high as hell right now.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.639
  But it's not about me, man.

36:49.641 --> 36:50.874
  Let's talk about you, Barry.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.309
I feel like I let you guys down
         a little bit.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.076
      You definitely did.

36:53.078 --> 36:57.414
     I-I-I, actually I did-
  I did share a cab ride home

36:57.416 --> 36:59.916
   with a pretty awesome girl
    after the date, though.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.051
             What?
             - And?

37:01.053 --> 37:02.919
  And it was- it was awesome.

37:02.921 --> 37:04.154
     I don't know, it was-
         it was weird.

37:04.156 --> 37:05.388
   We had so much in common,
           you know?

37:05.390 --> 37:06.356
     She was just like me.

37:06.358 --> 37:09.092
     She was smart, witty,
         good-looking.

37:09.094 --> 37:10.694
    Okay, okay, okay, okay.

37:10.696 --> 37:11.895
 Did you get her phone number?

37:11.897 --> 37:14.064
         No, I figured
  I'd bump into her sometime.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.098
             Dude!
             - Oh.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.566
   Are you out of your mind?

37:16.568 --> 37:18.101
 We've scoured this entire city

37:18.103 --> 37:19.369
        to find someone
      who can tolerate you

37:19.371 --> 37:20.570
  for more than three seconds,

37:20.572 --> 37:22.439
     then you finally find
    somebody that likes you

37:22.441 --> 37:24.007
       and you don't even
    get her fucking number?

37:24.009 --> 37:26.076
   I wanted to play it cool.
            - Cool?!

37:26.078 --> 37:27.344
   We are way past cool, man.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.112
    This shit is desperate!

37:29.114 --> 37:31.715
  Can I have a chocolate malt?
         I need a malt.

37:31.717 --> 37:33.183
        We'll find her.
    Just- what was her name?

37:33.185 --> 37:35.118
              Mel.
          - Mel what?

37:35.120 --> 37:38.955
        Mm... Mel, um...
           - Melvin?

37:38.957 --> 37:40.023
          Mel Gibson.

37:40.025 --> 37:43.760
   Mel, uh, it was like, ah!
    The- the- the, like the-

37:43.762 --> 37:45.295
      Think, think, think
       what was her name?

37:45.297 --> 37:46.630
          Fuck, Barry!

37:46.632 --> 37:49.065
    Well then, heck, Barry,
      what's the GD point?

37:49.067 --> 37:51.401
    Barry! I will literally
  club you with this bar spoon

37:51.403 --> 37:53.236
if you don't tell me who she is.

37:53.238 --> 37:54.104
            Tell me!

37:54.106 --> 37:56.106
      Wait, I just got it!

37:56.108 --> 37:57.807
        Oh, Mel Miller.
        - She's pretty.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.943
      Wow. Graduated from
           Berkeley.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.112
        Volunteers at a
      dog adoption center.

38:02.114 --> 38:02.779
         Is this real?

38:03.748 --> 38:06.116
     Or is this some, like,
    catfish type situation?

38:06.118 --> 38:07.784
       I got her number.
           Call her.

38:07.786 --> 38:08.251
             Wait!

38:08.253 --> 38:11.121
 We only got one shot at this,
           all right?

38:11.123 --> 38:12.355
      Better do it right.

38:16.594 --> 38:18.228
              BOO!
            [gasps]

38:18.230 --> 38:20.263
           [laughing]

38:20.265 --> 38:22.799
        Oh, every time!
            - Yeah.

38:22.801 --> 38:27.304
   Oh, it is ridiculously hot
           out there.

38:27.306 --> 38:28.772
              Oh.

38:28.774 --> 38:33.910
   I am so clammy and sticky
        and disgusting.

38:35.613 --> 38:37.414
  I think I put deodorant on.

38:38.249 --> 38:39.649
            [coughs]

38:39.651 --> 38:41.618
             Whoo!
   - Are you wearing my bra?

38:41.620 --> 38:42.452
             Oh...

38:43.154 --> 38:45.755
   Yeah, I had to borrow it.
             - Why?

38:45.757 --> 38:47.257
      To match your thong.

38:47.858 --> 38:49.659
      Do you want it back?

38:49.661 --> 38:50.694
              No.

38:52.029 --> 38:53.229
         Oh, you sure?

38:53.864 --> 38:55.165
 Actually I might need a hand.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.966
      N- no, you keep it.
            Really.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.068
           Thank you.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.338
  It's really stuck up there.

39:01.340 --> 39:02.372
             Yeah.

39:02.374 --> 39:05.308
     So, you heard anything
       from the cab guy?

39:05.310 --> 39:07.377
         Oh, that guy.
            Um, no.

39:07.379 --> 39:09.679
  He hasn't got my number, so-
           - Bummer.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.314
     I don't care, anyway.

39:11.316 --> 39:13.283
      It's better for you
         if I'm single.

39:13.285 --> 39:13.817
             Right?

39:13.819 --> 39:17.220
       What would you do
    without your wing girl?

39:17.222 --> 39:18.822
           Get dates.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.123
      You wouldn't, Paige.

39:20.125 --> 39:20.857
              No?

39:21.492 --> 39:23.360
   It's really hard for you.

39:25.229 --> 39:28.198
   Babe, you've got to learn
       to love yourself,

39:28.200 --> 39:29.232
  before others can love you.

39:29.234 --> 39:31.301
  My self-esteem is fine now.

39:31.303 --> 39:34.571
      No, I mean literally
         love yourself.

39:34.573 --> 39:35.939
           You know?

39:36.374 --> 39:38.074
          Down there.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.476
       Between your legs.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.010
    Do you know what I mean?

39:41.012 --> 39:43.046
      Try the showerhead.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.315
 Try your electric toothbrush.

39:45.317 --> 39:47.584
  Yours is a lot more powerful
           than mine

39:47.586 --> 39:49.185
   and really gets in there.

39:49.187 --> 39:51.054
   That is really disgusting.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.856
    It's not. It's natural.

39:52.858 --> 39:55.225
 This is the problem with you,
             Paige.

39:55.227 --> 39:59.062
    Why do you think I spend
    so long in the bathroom
         every morning?

39:59.064 --> 40:01.231
       I'm masturbating.
             - Hm.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.032
  A good hour before breakfast

40:03.034 --> 40:05.735
     and usually forty-five
 minutes if I can squeeze it in

40:05.737 --> 40:07.370
        when I get home.

40:07.372 --> 40:09.839
 I'm gonna get you masturbating
  if it's the last thing I do.

40:09.841 --> 40:10.740
         I'm all good.

40:10.742 --> 40:13.343
       [cellphone playing
       electronic music]

40:17.315 --> 40:20.550
  Hey, Mel, this is Barry, uh,
         from the cab.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.085
           Oh, um...

40:22.087 --> 40:23.920
             Uh...

40:25.456 --> 40:26.890
    It's him, it's the guy.

40:26.892 --> 40:29.893
[breathing too quickly to speak]

40:29.895 --> 40:31.928
   It's the guy from the cab.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.798
     Okay, speak as little
          as possible.

40:34.800 --> 40:35.965
          Okay, okay.
         I'm all good.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.203
         Hey, so um...

40:40.205 --> 40:43.106
    you some kind of pervert
     stalker or something?

40:43.108 --> 40:44.374
        Yeah, sometimes.

40:44.376 --> 40:46.075
              No!
     - Just read the cards.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.977
        Uh, I can't read
      Kurt's handwriting.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.279
  What are you talking about?
            It says,

40:49.281 --> 40:50.980
   "I was wondering if you're
not doing anything Friday night

40:50.982 --> 40:52.148
     if you'd like to go to
         dinner with me

40:52.150 --> 40:53.416
    or any other activity."

40:53.418 --> 40:55.452
  Oh my God, could you make it
          any wordier?

40:55.454 --> 40:56.719
    Who are you talking to?

40:56.721 --> 40:57.754
      I'm talking to you.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.457
 I was wondering if you want me
    to come in your- what?!

41:00.459 --> 41:01.391
              No!

41:01.393 --> 41:03.092
        What's going on?
        - I don't know.

41:03.094 --> 41:05.428
     Speak from your heart.
           - Shut up!

41:05.430 --> 41:06.896
     Are you talking to me?
             - Yes.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.398
          Oh, really?

41:08.400 --> 41:09.666
            No, no.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.301
         Read the card.
         - You shut up.

41:11.303 --> 41:12.335
  Please don't screw this up.

41:12.337 --> 41:13.536
          You shut up!

41:14.071 --> 41:15.405
           Fuck off.

41:15.407 --> 41:16.339
           Fuck you.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.275
     Are you getting' busy
        on Friday night?

41:19.277 --> 41:20.677
            [sighs]
            I dunno.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.979
You tell me if I'm getting busy
         Friday night.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.414
        What, is English
      her second language?

41:24.416 --> 41:25.982
          I think so.
           [giggles]

41:25.984 --> 41:29.519
    and, uh- and we'll talk
    about the details later.

41:29.521 --> 41:31.421
        Cool... see ya.

41:31.423 --> 41:32.755
         Cool, see ya.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.591
              Oh!

41:34.593 --> 41:36.426
         He got a date!

41:36.428 --> 41:38.261
          Down there.

41:38.696 --> 41:39.796
         I have a date.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.064
             What?
            - Yeah.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.501
       I mean we'll see.
         I don't know.

41:44.503 --> 41:45.802
          I love him.

41:45.804 --> 41:48.037
      I think I need to go
       and have a shower.

41:49.341 --> 41:53.276
 I feel so inspired after that,
         it was just--

41:53.278 --> 41:54.511
            I know.

41:54.513 --> 41:56.279
  It's like I'm alive, right?
       - I know, I know!

41:56.281 --> 41:58.281
         I feel alive.
  - It's just, it was so real.

41:58.283 --> 42:00.350
         Oh God, this-
       this is hands-down

42:00.352 --> 42:02.352
      the best first date
         I've ever had.

42:02.354 --> 42:03.987
             Yeah?
            - Ever!

42:03.989 --> 42:05.955
           Mine too.
            - Yeah?

42:05.957 --> 42:10.326
  And no one has ever taken me
     to a cockfight before.

42:10.328 --> 42:11.361
     I can't believe that.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.396
       You got cockfight
     written all over you.

42:13.398 --> 42:14.464
      It's so... violent.

42:14.466 --> 42:16.466
     And so bloody, I know.

42:16.468 --> 42:18.234
      Feathers everywhere.

42:18.236 --> 42:19.369
       Poor little guys.
            - Yeah.

42:19.371 --> 42:22.205
       Yeah, but you made
that great call on dinner, so...

42:22.207 --> 42:23.206
             Yeah?
            - Yeah.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.675
         Oh, well I'm-
     I'm glad you liked it.

42:25.677 --> 42:29.379
       I think they have
 incredible cuisine at Hooters,

       Because I thought
       he was different.

01:10:13.009 --> 01:10:16.110
 But he wasn't and that's fine.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:20.715
     There's a new tech guy
         at my office.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:22.250
     I could introduce you.

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:23.918
       What do ya think?

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:31.426
   I think I am not going to
  let myself get hurt anymore.

01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:33.161
          But thanks.

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:36.965
           Thank you.

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:47.542
     Hey, what's going on?

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:50.245
    I thought we were gonna
           sleep in.

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:52.213
      Yeah, I can't sleep.
            [sighs]

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:55.183
    My boss wants me to take
          a drug test.

01:10:55.185 --> 01:10:56.784
     I'm gonna lose my job.

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:01.256
             Okay.

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:02.223
            [sighs]

01:11:02.225 --> 01:11:03.858
  We'll figure something out.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:10.732
        But you have to
       promise something.

01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:12.367
             What?
             What?

01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:13.835
       Okay, look, um...

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:17.905
 You love your job just as much
       as I love my job.

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:18.940
             Yeah.

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:22.110
  But I feel like things were
just starting to get good again

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:23.945
   and now we're kind of like
         slipping back

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:26.281
      into that bad place,
     you know what I mean?

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:28.583
             I do.

01:11:28.585 --> 01:11:29.384
             Yeah.

01:11:29.386 --> 01:11:31.819
Okay, so let's just make a deal.

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:33.121
    You don't work weekends

01:11:33.123 --> 01:11:35.323
      and we'll both take
       our vacation days.

01:11:35.325 --> 01:11:36.991
     Does that sound good?

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:38.259
          Yeah, yeah.

01:11:38.261 --> 01:11:39.460
       That sounds good.

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:41.629
          I love you.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:43.164
              Mmm.

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:44.399
   I'm still gonna get fired.

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.801
 No... 'cause I've got a plan.

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.439
    Strictly week days, huh?
           - Mm-hmm.

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:54.142
  We, uh, found some balance.

01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:56.244
       I dumped Camille.
           - Really?

01:11:56.246 --> 01:11:58.413
        Yeah, I- I think
        I can do better.

01:11:58.415 --> 01:11:59.447
              Wow.

01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:00.515
      We never liked her.

01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:02.250
        Not even a bit.
    - Barry mentioned that.

01:12:02.252 --> 01:12:04.819
     She was a straight-up
     bizznussneeznashnush.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.854
She offered me a blow job once.

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:09.090
           Too soon.
   - She offered. I said no.

01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:10.158
      Rafe, how's dating?

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.526
       Uh, haven't been.

01:12:11.528 --> 01:12:14.195
    Without Barry I've been
spending a ton of time with JT.

01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:15.963
        The kid's great.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:17.832
  He does miss Barry, though.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.802
  I mean I don't, at all, no.

01:12:20.804 --> 01:12:22.637
    The guy was a nightmare.

01:12:22.639 --> 01:12:25.206
      It's so much easier
      without him around.

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:26.641
  No more messes to clean up.

01:12:26.643 --> 01:12:27.642
        No more hassles.

01:12:27.644 --> 01:12:30.178
    No one to apologize for.

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.180
    No one to apologize for.

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.284
        It kinda sucks.

01:12:36.286 --> 01:12:37.685
             Yeah.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.087
            Totally.

01:12:42.157 --> 01:12:43.691
 I'm just so bummed, you know,

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.293
   not only was she a really
        fantastic girl,

01:12:45.295 --> 01:12:51.232
  but she had... these great,
   big juicy jugs, you know?

01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:53.134
       Just showstoppers.

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:54.802
      [knock on the door]
             Oh...

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:56.170
     someone's at my door.
         I-I gotta go.

01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:57.305
      I'll call you later,
         okay Grandma?

01:12:57.307 --> 01:12:58.906
        I love you. Bye.

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.778
           [all] Hey.

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.714
 What are you guys doing here?

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.116
          Can we talk?

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:12.019
             Uh...

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:14.655
    Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
          come on in.

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:19.927
  And when we say we are sorry
about everything we said and did

01:13:19.929 --> 01:13:21.262
       we really mean it.

01:13:21.264 --> 01:13:22.864
     What we said was mean.

01:13:22.866 --> 01:13:24.899
     And the stuff we said
        about Mel, too.

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.267
I mean she didn't deserve that.

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:28.503
 Yeah, she didn't deserve that.
      She's a sweetheart.

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:29.937
  But I'll relay that message
             to her

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:31.406
  if I ever talk to her again.

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.274
    We want you back, Barry.

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:34.909
   We're your friends, Barry.
            Always.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:38.112
   No matter what ridiculous,
       obnoxious, inane,

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:39.747
   stupid thing you might do.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:42.250
    Yeah, I probably will do
      something like that.

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:44.352
  Barry, will you forgive us?

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.188
       I don't think so.

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.425
   Now I want you guys to get
   out of my house right now.

01:13:50.427 --> 01:13:52.727
        Get outta here!

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:55.229
   I'm kidding! I'm kidding.
       I'm kidding, guys.

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:56.798
  Oh my God I got goose bumps.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.232
      Like, I could barely
         pull that off.

01:13:58.234 --> 01:13:59.200
     Did you guys see that?

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:00.134
              Ah!
            - Yeah.

01:14:00.136 --> 01:14:01.269
       So, pals forever?

01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:02.303
     Dick tattoos, finally?

01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:03.371
      Are we gonna do it?
           [all] No.

01:14:03.373 --> 01:14:06.073
   You get a tattoo of a dick
          on your dick

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:07.942
 and on the tattoo of the dick
          on your dick

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:09.277
    it says, "Pals forever."

01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:10.378
      I'm mainly concerned
        about the pain.

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.546
       That'a the point!

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:12.747
            Asshole!

01:14:12.749 --> 01:14:14.382
           [laughter]

01:14:14.384 --> 01:14:16.150
I love it when you get this guy.

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:17.318
          Look at you!
           [laughing]

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:25.493
             [Kurt]
   And I knew that if I just
   concentrated hard enough,

01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:26.594
     believed hard enough,

01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:29.230
           [Desmond]
 You didn't revive the possum,
             Kurt.

01:14:29.232 --> 01:14:31.666
      That's what they do.
       They play possum.

01:14:31.668 --> 01:14:33.100
       You never heard of
        playing possum?

01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:35.236
  No, why would you wanna play
      with a dead animal?

01:14:35.238 --> 01:14:37.004
       They're not dead.
 They're pretending to be dead.

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:39.440
You did not revive that animal.

01:14:39.442 --> 01:14:43.110
     Rafe, maybe you're not
       understanding me.

01:14:43.112 --> 01:14:46.280
   You don't have the powers
    to revive dead animals.

01:14:46.282 --> 01:14:47.315
           [Desmond]
    Whatcha got there, man?

01:14:47.317 --> 01:14:49.450
        Hey! Hey, buddy.

01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:50.485
            Nothin'.

01:14:50.487 --> 01:14:53.988
   Just, uh... oh, uh, I, uh,

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.756
      have something here
I've been meaning to give to you

01:14:55.758 --> 01:14:57.758
      for a little while.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.195
   It's, uh, my share of the
       mail order bride.

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:03.331
    Or it's a start, anyway.

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:04.632
          Thanks, man.

01:15:04.634 --> 01:15:08.503
I do need a wallet, but for now,
      this'll have to do.

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:11.172
       How are you, man?
      - Good, good, good.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:12.340
     Yeah, I'm really well.

01:15:12.342 --> 01:15:14.809
      You know, like, uh,
         things feel...

01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:17.512
   ...uh, things feel shitty.

01:15:17.514 --> 01:15:18.513
     I can't get over Mel.

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:19.947
I can't stop thinking about her.

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:21.816
           I'm just-
          I'm a wreck.

01:15:21.818 --> 01:15:23.784
        You know, I- I-
           [chuckles]

01:15:23.786 --> 01:15:25.720
most girls don't understand me,
              Des.

01:15:25.722 --> 01:15:26.554
         They punch me.

01:15:26.556 --> 01:15:29.357
      But Mel, she got me.

01:15:29.359 --> 01:15:31.025
         And I blew it.

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.460
     Well, you got us, man.

01:15:32.462 --> 01:15:34.028
  Yeah, I know, I know. And I-

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.796
  I'm thrilled that we're all
  hanging out together again,

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:37.431
    believe me, I-I just...

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.469
   Nobody else makes me feel
     the way that she does.

01:15:41.471 --> 01:15:43.070
And that's no slam to you guys,
           you know?

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:44.405
 Nobody makes me feel that way.

01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:47.174
     I- I- I've never even
           considered

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:49.043
  spending the rest of my life
         with somebody.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.411
    Have you told her this?

01:15:50.413 --> 01:15:52.647
       What do you mean?
     - Like, how you feel?

01:15:52.649 --> 01:15:53.748
      How would I do that?

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:56.584
     I mean, what you said
   sounded pretty darn good.

01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:58.753
           No, what?
           You think?

01:15:58.755 --> 01:16:00.054
          Absolutely.

01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:01.689
   I gotta tell her, don't I?
          - For sure.

01:16:01.691 --> 01:16:03.891
  I gotta do this. I'm gonna-
   we gotta- I gotta do this.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:04.926
   I'm gonna do it on Monday.

01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:06.561
         Well, um, why-
          why Monday?

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:09.497
  Monday's way better for me.
     The weekend is packed.

01:16:09.499 --> 01:16:10.565
      I got- I got grout.

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:13.000
        I gotta transfer
     all my BluRays to DVD.

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:14.902
  You cannot wait 'til Monday,
             Barry.

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:17.204
 You've met the woman that you
wanna drive everyone crazy with

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:18.506
   for the rest of your life.

01:16:18.508 --> 01:16:20.708
             Yeah.
 - You have to be with her now.

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:22.343
           I have to.
            - Good.

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:23.611
   Do you know where she is?

01:16:23.613 --> 01:16:26.347
         What's today?
         - Um, Friday.

01:16:26.349 --> 01:16:28.282

        The one you just
      can't take anywhere.

01:22:47.396 --> 01:22:50.631
     Hi. You didn't see me
     but I had a great like
    Bionic Man thing going.

  He's a counselor at my camp.

01:22:57.406 --> 01:22:58.839
    Avoid him at all costs,
           all right?

01:22:58.841 --> 01:23:01.475
