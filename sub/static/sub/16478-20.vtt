I might have an ulterior motive.

02:08.744 --> 02:11.612
There are a couple of things

the food and wine might

This about Clearwater?

02:17.853 --> 02:18.852
Ah!

02:18.854 --> 02:20.654
So, few weeks ago...

02:20.656 --> 02:23.089
Yeah.
...on the Brossette case,

02:23.091 --> 02:25.825
we learned several housing
developments were shelved there.

02:25.827 --> 02:27.860
Police resources were curbed.
Yeah, Mayor Hamilton

02:27.862 --> 02:31.064
was behind all of it,
but we never found out why.

02:31.066 --> 02:32.098
Well, I may have.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.233
Someone's been buying

02:33.235 --> 02:35.201
properties in Clearwater
at a huge rate,

02:35.203 --> 02:38.037
pushing people out
when they don't want to sell.

02:38.039 --> 02:39.405
And you think
it's Hamilton?

02:39.407 --> 02:41.106
Well, it makes sense.

02:41.108 --> 02:42.608
Deny services
to the residents,

02:42.610 --> 02:44.644
and then sweep in
and buy their houses.

02:44.646 --> 02:47.046
It's a poor immigrant community.

02:47.048 --> 02:48.848
Property values
are rock-bottom.

02:48.850 --> 02:50.783
No profits to be made.

02:50.785 --> 02:53.352
I have to figure out
Hamilton's angle.

02:53.354 --> 02:54.753
Well, this is a city matter.

02:54.755 --> 02:56.221
You're NCIS.

02:56.223 --> 02:57.622
No jurisdiction.

02:57.624 --> 02:59.291
Me, on the other hand,

02:59.293 --> 03:01.893
go to Clearwater, question
some of the complainants,

03:01.895 --> 03:03.495

the property,

03:03.497 --> 03:05.797

for the D.A.

03:05.799 --> 03:07.499
Hamilton basically got
the D.A. elected.

03:07.501 --> 03:09.734
He's kissing cousins
with half the office.

03:09.736 --> 03:12.604
You'd be putting a target
on your back at work.

03:12.606 --> 03:14.673
That's the second thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

03:14.675 --> 03:18.710

04:24.109 --> 04:26.109
Didn't turn out

have to get the body

the weapon and the shooter.

04:33.784 --> 04:35.684
Kelly acted crazy
during the deal.

04:35.686 --> 04:37.153
NOPD Vice had to take him out.

04:37.155 --> 04:39.087
He was dealing drugs
to an undercover cop?

04:39.089 --> 04:41.390
Fentanyl,
according to NOPD.

04:41.392 --> 04:45.161
A synthetic opioid 50 times
more powerful than heroin.

of the spectrum.

Must've. I mean, we shut down
the local operation last year.

07:17.343 --> 07:19.242
Took out one of
his big drug labs.

07:19.244 --> 07:20.678
Confiscated 50 keys.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.845

08:03.855 --> 08:06.188
I guess it has been
a while, Chris.

08:06.190 --> 08:07.724
Um...

08:07.726 --> 08:09.524
Molly left me.

08:10.862 --> 08:12.361
Guess I'm an acquired taste.

08:12.363 --> 08:13.795
Sorry to hear that.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.164
Mm.

08:15.166 --> 08:17.967
Come on. I'll take you home.

08:17.969 --> 08:20.102
All right.

08:27.043 --> 08:30.679
Okay. According to NOPD,
Kelly was smuggling fentanyl

08:30.681 --> 08:32.681
off of incoming cargo ships.

08:32.683 --> 08:34.549
Problem is, the vessels
he was off-loading

08:34.551 --> 08:36.251
come from
the Southern Hemisphere.

08:36.253 --> 08:38.986
Fentanyl's usually manufactured
in China and East Asia.

08:38.989 --> 08:41.722
If Kelly was a part
of an international drug ring,

08:41.724 --> 08:44.425
there'd be signs
in his digital life--

08:44.427 --> 08:46.594
phone calls, e-mails,

08:46.596 --> 08:48.763
activity in the Dark Web--
but there's nothing.

08:48.765 --> 08:50.390
There is one discrepancy.

08:50.391 --> 08:51.790
Kelly was loading a ship

08:51.792 --> 08:54.025
that was bound
for the Panama Canal yesterday.

08:54.027 --> 08:56.161
A hundred crates
of dry goods for

08:56.163 --> 08:58.429
the USNS <i>Tacoma.</i>

08:58.431 --> 09:00.131
He ended up loading 101 crates.

09:00.133 --> 09:02.600
Did a manual correction
in the ship's log.

09:02.602 --> 09:04.870
I contacted
the Navy logistics officer.

09:04.872 --> 09:07.672
There's no record
of this extra crate.

09:07.674 --> 09:09.074
King, what if
Kelly wasn't

09:09.076 --> 09:12.143
smuggling drugs
<i>in</i> to New Orleans...

09:12.145 --> 09:13.544
But smuggling them out.

09:13.546 --> 09:15.713
Skimmed a key off the
top to sell on the side,

09:15.715 --> 09:17.348
got clipped by the cops.

09:17.350 --> 09:19.517
Still doesn't answer the
question of who supplied him.

09:19.519 --> 09:22.353
Keep digging into Kelly's life;
there's got to be something.

09:22.355 --> 09:24.188
Well, I might not be able
to tell you about Kelly's life,

09:24.190 --> 09:25.956
but I can tell you
about the drugs that he had.

09:25.958 --> 09:27.458
See, every batch of
synthetic narcotics

09:27.460 --> 09:28.760
has its own unique
chemical recipe,

09:28.762 --> 09:30.294
kind of like DNA.

09:30.296 --> 09:32.529
Well, the brick of fentanyl
that was in Kelly's car,

09:32.531 --> 09:34.064
that was manufactured
here in New Orleans.

09:34.066 --> 09:35.665
<b><font color="#FF8000">GREGORIO:</font></b> From the same drug lab
that vice busted last year.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.968
<b><font color="#FF8000">SEBASTIAN:</font></b> Yeah, from the same
batch that was confiscated

09:37.970 --> 09:39.836
in that bust.
By all accounts,

09:39.838 --> 09:42.172
this should be
in an NOPD evidence locker.

09:42.174 --> 09:44.074
Somehow, Kelly got
possession of the drugs.

09:44.076 --> 09:45.809
<b><font color="#FF8000">GREGORIO:</font></b>
Well, if that's true,

09:45.811 --> 09:47.511
then he definitely couldn't
have done it alone.

09:47.513 --> 09:49.880
He had to have help
from inside the NOPD.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.815
Not just NOPD.

09:51.817 --> 09:53.417
The vice squad.

09:53.419 --> 09:54.951
My old unit.

09:54.953 --> 09:56.252
I mean, that's what
you're suggesting,

09:56.254 --> 09:58.455
isn't it?

10:00.000 --> 10:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:08.854 --> 10:10.921
So we're saying
that someone stole 50 kilos

10:10.923 --> 10:12.455
of fentanyl
from the NOPD,

10:12.457 --> 10:14.625
gave it to Kelly to smuggle
out of the country.

10:14.627 --> 10:15.626
Probably a vice cop.

10:15.628 --> 10:17.060
We have no proof of that.

10:18.030 --> 10:19.796
Well, I-I tested
the drugs.

10:19.798 --> 10:21.664
They're from the same batch;
that's pretty strong evidence.

10:21.666 --> 10:23.133
Not to me, Sebastian.

10:23.135 --> 10:26.002
Not when you're talking about
my old unit being corrupt.

10:26.004 --> 10:27.303
<b><font color="#FF8000">SEBASTIAN:</font></b> I'm just saying
that the drugs match,

10:27.305 --> 10:29.439
that's all.
You don't know these guys.

10:29.441 --> 10:32.842
After Katrina, my house was
destroyed, Marino took me in.

10:32.844 --> 10:34.144
The rest of the unit,

10:34.146 --> 10:35.311
they helped rebuild; every day,

10:35.313 --> 10:36.979
after work, they pitched in.

10:36.981 --> 10:39.181
All right, guys like that
don't do this!

Christopher.

10:40.184 --> 10:42.418
Let's take this one step
at a time.

10:42.420 --> 10:43.920
Okay, we know that Kelly

10:43.922 --> 10:45.421
had the fentanyl,
and it looks like

10:45.423 --> 10:47.156
he loaded it onto a cargo ship.

10:47.158 --> 10:49.291
Which is currently headed
for the Panama Canal.

10:49.293 --> 10:50.626
<b><font color="#FF8000">PRIDE:</font></b>
Contact the Coast Guard.

10:50.628 --> 10:52.662
Get on that ship.
Find the extra crate.

10:52.664 --> 10:53.863
Oh, you know what,
I should go, too.

10:53.865 --> 10:55.830
I thought you and boats
don't get along so well.

10:55.832 --> 10:57.232
No, I love boats,
it's just the water

10:57.234 --> 10:58.300
that makes me want to hurl.

10:58.302 --> 10:59.634
But the point is
you're gonna need me

10:59.636 --> 11:00.769
to test the fentanyl.

11:00.771 --> 11:02.371
Besides, I'm an
NCIS agent now, right?

11:02.373 --> 11:04.206
I got to get my sea
legs at some point.

11:04.208 --> 11:05.941
Take him.

11:05.943 --> 11:07.709
Come on.

11:07.711 --> 11:10.011
If you throw up on me,
I'll shoot you.

11:10.013 --> 11:11.913
No pressure, though, right?

11:14.952 --> 11:17.052
<font color="#D900D9">(sighs)</font>

11:17.054 --> 11:19.788
Now, I came up with these cops.
They're like family.

11:19.790 --> 11:21.189
You know 'em, too.

11:21.191 --> 11:22.857
Now, they seem like
the kind of people

11:22.859 --> 11:25.226
who would take a penny
that doesn't belong to 'em?

11:25.228 --> 11:27.828
We're not talking about a penny,
Christopher.

11:27.830 --> 11:31.265
Look, they're good guys, but
we-we got to investigate.

11:31.267 --> 11:33.033
This is all kinds
of personal for you,

11:33.035 --> 11:35.035
so if it's
too close to home, then...

11:35.037 --> 11:36.337
No, I'm good.

11:36.339 --> 11:38.539

11:48.283 --> 11:50.450

choppier than I would've liked.

11:50.452 --> 11:51.785

out of patches.

11:51.787 --> 11:53.553
All right, well, look,
take one of these.

11:53.555 --> 11:54.554
What is it?

11:54.556 --> 11:56.090
What do you know
about Chinese medicine?

11:56.092 --> 11:58.859
I'm more of a dabbler
than an expert, really.

11:58.861 --> 12:00.760
I went to get acupuncture once,
but then I just kept thinking

12:00.762 --> 12:02.629
about <i>Hellraiser</i> and that
guy with all the needles

12:02.631 --> 12:03.387
in his face, I freaked out.

12:03.411 --> 12:05.133
Okay, well, I have
a great acupuncturist.

12:05.134 --> 12:06.433
He put this
herbal blend together;

12:06.435 --> 12:08.101
it helped me
with seasickness.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.736
- I'm all right, thanks.
- What do you mean you're good?

12:09.738 --> 12:11.070
You don't trust me?

12:11.072 --> 12:12.739
No, I trust you.
It's just, you know,

12:12.741 --> 12:15.108
I like to do a full spectrum
analysis of anything new

12:15.110 --> 12:18.044

before I ingest it. It's fine.

12:18.046 --> 12:20.479
All right, look at you. Come on.

Yeah, I wasn't given
much of a choice,

12:33.661 --> 12:34.960
and I'm not sure
why you're here.

12:34.962 --> 12:37.396
We just need to inspect
some cargo that you're hauling.

12:37.398 --> 12:39.298
Inspections are traditionally
done in the port

12:39.300 --> 12:40.666

12:40.668 --> 12:43.502
Yeah, well, this is one of those
nontraditional inspections.

I did. I took them
there myself, okay?

Unless, of course,

get Public Integrity involved.

Of course I believe you.

27:08.490 --> 27:10.723
O-Over some fentanyl

from evidence?

27:12.226 --> 27:13.626
Not just fentanyl.

of cash recently,

but Marino...

29:38.267 --> 29:39.733
flat broke.

Plan was to dump
the drugs in the ocean,

30:25.380 --> 30:26.779
marked with geotrackers,

30:26.781 --> 30:28.648
then the buyers would collect
them later in a small boat.

And who are they?

30:35.389 --> 30:36.822
Mexican drug cartel.

30:36.824 --> 30:38.758
They were buying back drugs
that were confiscated here

30:38.760 --> 30:40.760
and redistributing them
in new territories.

30:40.762 --> 30:43.428
Yeah, we essentially uncovered
a drug recycling operation.

30:43.430 --> 30:45.330
Well, it takes
cash, planning.

30:45.332 --> 30:47.199
None of our suspects
fit the bill.

30:47.201 --> 30:48.467

30:48.469 --> 30:49.535
a bigger player involved.

30:49.537 --> 30:51.270
Mitchell has no idea
who's in charge,

30:51.272 --> 30:53.405

his bank account information.

30:53.407 --> 30:55.807
Yeah, a company has
been wiring him payments.

30:55.809 --> 30:59.443
Uh, some offshore corporation
called Audubon Industries.

in our drug smuggling ring.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.426
What did you
learn about them?

31:49.428 --> 31:51.728
Not much. It's a
glorified shell company.

31:51.730 --> 31:53.230
They've got an
empty office,

31:53.232 --> 31:55.532
no more than a desk
and a phone, really,

31:55.534 --> 31:57.900
and millions invested
in Clearwater.

31:57.902 --> 32:02.572
Yeah, probably financed from the
sale of confiscated narcotics.

32:02.574 --> 32:06.909
And if Hamilton
is connected to Clearwater,

32:06.911 --> 32:09.078
he must be connected
to the drugs.

32:09.080 --> 32:11.313
He's too smart to have
any direct contact.

32:11.315 --> 32:13.783
So, what? Someone's working
on his behalf?

32:13.785 --> 32:16.986
That vice cop you arrested?

32:16.988 --> 32:19.222
Marino.

32:19.224 --> 32:21.457
He's been plagued
by complaints for years.

32:21.459 --> 32:23.225
Hard to believe
Hamilton would trust him.

32:23.227 --> 32:25.026
Prefer a partner
beyond reproach.

32:25.028 --> 32:26.962
So we're looking for
another cop.

32:26.964 --> 32:28.530
Someone who Hamilton knows well.

32:28.532 --> 32:29.732
Means they have history.

32:29.734 --> 32:33.034
Find that cop,
we bring down Hamilton.

32:33.036 --> 32:35.003

Well, that's half
the department, right?

a friend to law and order.

33:18.314 --> 33:21.115

We need deep ties, favors done.

33:21.117 --> 33:22.482
Someone who owes him.

33:22.484 --> 33:25.119
How about a cop who was
in deep with Public Integrity?

33:25.121 --> 33:27.387
I'm talking about
a confidential investigation

33:27.389 --> 33:28.822

33:28.824 --> 33:30.457

five years ago.

33:30.459 --> 33:31.991
Well, how could he still
be on the job?

33:31.993 --> 33:34.661
Drugs magically reappeared
in evidence.

33:34.663 --> 33:36.129
Investigation never went public,

on charges.

33:48.810 --> 33:50.509

36:02.171 --> 36:03.704
We need an exact location.

36:03.706 --> 36:05.071
There's an access road.

36:05.073 --> 36:07.741
Zeroing in on
his precise coordinates now.

36:07.743 --> 36:09.108
You shot him!

36:09.110 --> 36:11.244
No, <i>you</i> shot him, Richard.

36:11.246 --> 36:13.279
After you managed
to get out of your cuffs.

36:13.281 --> 36:14.280
You're out of your mind!

36:14.282 --> 36:15.916
Cost of doing business.

36:15.918 --> 36:18.318
Turn around, Richard!
This'll go fast.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.385
Screw you.

It's over, Spencer!
Drop it now!

36:38.873 --> 36:40.238
Drop the weapon!

36:47.849 --> 36:49.247

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Spencer.

36:51.285 --> 36:54.186
Hey, hey, Spencer.
You're gonna be all right.

36:54.188 --> 36:56.588
Chris, call 911.
Hurry.

36:56.590 --> 36:57.922
Spencer, we're gonna
cut you a deal.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.924
A deal, you understand?

36:59.926 --> 37:01.994
You're gonna be all right,
all right, and then you're gonna

37:01.996 --> 37:03.295
talk to me,
and you're gonna tell me

37:03.297 --> 37:04.296
everything about Mayor Hamilton.

37:04.298 --> 37:06.031
All right?
We're gonna take him down.

37:06.033 --> 37:08.133
You're gonna help me
take him down, you understand?!

37:08.135 --> 37:09.434
Spencer!

37:09.436 --> 37:10.969
You underst...

37:10.971 --> 37:13.337

37:31.190 --> 37:33.690
Our only link
to Hamilton is dead,

37:33.692 --> 37:35.826
which puts us back
at square one.

37:35.828 --> 37:37.794
Not necessarily.

37:37.796 --> 37:39.430
We got a link to
Audubon Industries.

37:39.432 --> 37:41.765
Taking profit from
selling illegal drugs

37:41.767 --> 37:43.267
to buy property
in Clearwater.

37:43.269 --> 37:45.002
Still no connection
to Hamilton, though.

37:45.004 --> 37:47.170
Dude, what's with all
the negativity here?

37:47.172 --> 37:48.438
I'm sorry. I don't know.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.073
It's just, I feel like
I'm coming down

37:50.075 --> 37:51.508
from a high or
something, you know?

37:51.510 --> 37:53.076
Must be the pills
that Gregorio gave me.

37:53.078 --> 37:55.245
Sebastian, you're not
coming down from a high.

37:55.247 --> 37:57.280
It's okay, all right?
I don't blame you.

37:57.282 --> 37:59.516
It's just that my body
is a delicate ecosystem.

37:59.518 --> 38:02.318
Okay, so the pills...

38:02.320 --> 38:04.787
were not even Chinese herbs.

38:04.789 --> 38:08.791
Regular allergy medicine, over
the counter, nothing exotic.

<font color="#D900D9">(laughs)</font>
Hold on, all right.

38:12.764 --> 38:15.198
Wait a minute.
Now, I wasn't seasick.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.499
Right. Mm.
I wasn't nervous.

38:17.501 --> 38:19.735
But I-I kicked that guy's ass.

38:19.737 --> 38:21.336
Yeah, you did.

38:21.338 --> 38:23.205
That's right,
no special drugs.

38:23.207 --> 38:26.208
Just Forensic Agent Lund.

38:26.210 --> 38:28.644
So what you're saying is...

38:28.646 --> 38:30.379
I'm kind of awesome.

38:30.381 --> 38:32.281
Okay, that's my cue to go.

38:32.283 --> 38:33.534
Wait, can you not?
Don't leave me.

38:33.558 --> 38:34.484
No.

38:34.485 --> 38:36.218
Here, how about this?
How about you go onto Twitter,

38:36.220 --> 38:38.153
and you tweet: hashtag
“Sebastian's awesome”?

38:38.155 --> 38:40.089
Now you're thinking it.
You're thinking I'm awesome.

38:40.091 --> 38:42.157
I mean, you're thinking
“Sebastian's awesome”"

38:51.902 --> 38:54.002
I wasn't sure
you was coming in.

38:54.004 --> 38:55.570
I was at the hospital
seeing Roger.

38:55.572 --> 38:56.738
Yeah? How's he doing?

38:56.740 --> 38:58.840
He'll be good, eventually.

38:58.842 --> 39:00.341
What are you doing here?

39:00.343 --> 39:02.811
Pride and I was just
wrapping up the case.

39:02.813 --> 39:04.178
Listen, I...

39:04.180 --> 39:05.880
If you're gonna
apologize, don't.

39:05.882 --> 39:09.183
You got nothing to be sorry for.

39:09.185 --> 39:11.685
You did your job,

39:11.687 --> 39:13.721
and you saved my life.

39:13.723 --> 39:16.424
Still, what I put you through...

39:16.426 --> 39:17.558
No, Chris.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.327
I'm a mess.

39:19.329 --> 39:21.962
Have been for
quite a while now.

39:24.333 --> 39:27.434
You know it doesn't always
have to be like that.

39:27.436 --> 39:30.604
Consider this
a wake-up call.

39:30.606 --> 39:32.640
Time to make some real changes.

39:36.245 --> 39:39.113
You know, I haven't had a drink
since you arrested me.

39:39.115 --> 39:41.548
That's good.

39:41.550 --> 39:43.916
Yeah. Yeah.

39:45.287 --> 39:47.454
I'm here if you need
anything, all right?

39:47.456 --> 39:49.789
Look at you,
all grown up.

39:49.791 --> 39:52.725
I mean it, Richard.

39:52.727 --> 39:55.295
Me, too.

39:57.065 --> 39:59.165
Me, too.

40:16.617 --> 40:18.284
I'm glad
you're still here.

40:18.286 --> 40:22.254
And you're just
getting in-- again.

40:22.256 --> 40:26.425
Yeah, well, a lot to wrap
up with Spencer dead.

40:26.427 --> 40:28.794
Yeah, sorry you couldn't
take him alive.

40:28.796 --> 40:31.596
But you'll figure out
another way to get to Hamilton.

40:31.598 --> 40:34.132
Not me. We.

40:34.134 --> 40:36.367
We're a great team.

40:36.369 --> 40:39.171
We just need to tie
Hamilton to Audubon,

40:39.173 --> 40:42.440
and I got a couple ideas how.

40:42.442 --> 40:44.642
What do you say
we hash 'em out

40:44.644 --> 40:45.776
over breakfast?

40:45.778 --> 40:47.312
And then what?

40:47.314 --> 40:51.148
You rush off into the night
again, while I wait here?

40:51.150 --> 40:53.518
Well, you're safe here, Rita.

40:53.520 --> 40:56.421
I'm a prosecutor, Dwayne.
I lead the charge.

40:56.423 --> 40:59.457
I don't stay back and keep
the home fires burning.

40:59.459 --> 41:02.760
Well, Hamilton's different
than any case you've ever had.

41:02.762 --> 41:05.395
Okay? And I'm not gonna let
anything else happen to you.

41:05.397 --> 41:09.166
I don't want to worry
about my safety,

41:09.168 --> 41:10.901
and I don't want you to, either.

41:15.942 --> 41:17.574
What's this?

41:19.177 --> 41:21.445
It's a list of jazz clubs
in D.C.,

41:21.447 --> 41:24.814
where musicians can sit in
any Sunday night.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.953
Is that what you want?

41:29.955 --> 41:32.155
Not sure it's what I want,

41:32.157 --> 41:36.126
but... it's what I need.

41:36.128 --> 41:38.527
Look, we're not
kids anymore.

41:38.529 --> 41:40.029
We don't rush in head first.

41:40.031 --> 41:41.965
We've got lives and careers.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.167
Whatever we're doing here
deserves attention.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.568
I'm paying attention, Rita.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.103
I know you are.

41:47.105 --> 41:50.173
But you need your full focus
to go after Hamilton.

41:50.175 --> 41:54.477
You don't need
to worry about me.

41:54.479 --> 41:58.714
Take him down, Dwayne,
and get closure.

41:58.716 --> 42:02.618
And-and when you have,
I'll be in D.C.

42:02.620 --> 42:05.954
I'm not convinced
that we have to end this.

42:05.956 --> 42:10.025
Nothing's ending,
we're just hitting pause.
