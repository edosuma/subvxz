WEBVTT

00:01.446 --> 00:03.079
Hey, cap'n, got a second?

00:03.113 --> 00:05.848
- It's "Captain."
- What did I say?

00:05.849 --> 00:08.483
"Cap'n,"
like cap'n crunch.

00:08.517 --> 00:09.818
All right,
but to be fair,

00:09.818 --> 00:11.352
cap'n crunch
was a war hero

00:11.353 --> 00:12.954
and the primary
male role model

00:12.955 --> 00:15.890
in my house,
growing up, so...

00:15.924 --> 00:18.259
Anyways, cap-tain,
you know

00:18.260 --> 00:19.927
that jewelry store robbery
down by grand army Plaza?

00:19.961 --> 00:22.596
- Mm-hmm.
- I know who did it... Dustin Whitman.

00:22.597 --> 00:24.265
I put him in Rikers
two years ago.

00:24.266 --> 00:25.566
He just got out,
and the crime scene

00:25.567 --> 00:27.368
matches his M.O. perfectly.

00:27.369 --> 00:29.303
Okay, what do we got?

00:29.338 --> 00:32.707
Well, security cam
shows a male suspect, 5'9"...

00:32.741 --> 00:34.309
Wearing a black ski mask.

00:34.310 --> 00:35.877
He bypassed
the McConnell alarm

00:35.878 --> 00:37.445
by using
the magnetic kill switch.

00:37.446 --> 00:39.748
And he only stole diamonds,
nothing over two carats.

00:39.782 --> 00:41.349
Yeah, exactly.
How'd you know?

00:41.383 --> 00:44.385
I'm a Detective.
It's what I do.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.455
I'm just kidding.
I need a lot more information.

00:47.456 --> 00:49.123
But that would've been
a great exit line, right?

00:49.157 --> 00:50.424
The crime techs
aren't done yet,

00:50.425 --> 00:51.892
but I'm 100% sure
it's Whitman.

00:51.893 --> 00:53.327
Well, let's see
what kind of physical evidence

00:53.328 --> 00:55.395
they turn up,
and then we can talk arrest.

00:55.396 --> 00:58.232
Actually,
hilarious story.

00:58.266 --> 01:01.435
So that is Dustin Whitman.

01:01.469 --> 01:04.604
You already arrested him?
With insufficient evidence?

01:06.039 --> 01:08.440
By law, we have 48 hours
to find that evidence,

01:08.441 --> 01:10.108
or we have to let him go.

01:10.142 --> 01:11.576
You just started the clock.

01:15.379 --> 01:17.680
What's up
with this emergency meeting?

01:17.681 --> 01:20.581
Whoa, Detective Santiago.

01:20.615 --> 01:22.415
Big date tonight.
How do I look?

01:22.450 --> 01:24.317
Well, I think you look...

01:25.987 --> 01:28.254
Sorry, that was supposed
to be a catcall.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.789
I don't know
how this works.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.858
Hey, is this why you were
getting makeup tips

01:31.859 --> 01:33.727
from the prostitute
in the holding cell?

01:33.761 --> 01:35.929
I just wanted to know
how she got such smoky eyes.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.665
Turns out
it was an std rash.

01:38.700 --> 01:39.700
Detective Peralta
has made a collar

01:39.701 --> 01:41.068
in the jewelry store heist.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.703
- Way to go, jakey.
- Ah, that's okay.

01:42.704 --> 01:44.104
No. He didn't get
sufficient evidence

01:44.105 --> 01:45.405
to make it stick,
so we have

01:45.406 --> 01:47.641
the next 48 hours
to fix his mistake.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.209
Damn it, Jake.

01:49.243 --> 01:52.012
What evidence did you have
when you arrested this guy?

01:52.013 --> 01:53.580
Some pretty ironclad stuff.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.216
Dustin, it's been a while.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.152
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

01:58.186 --> 02:01.522
Well, well, well,
if it isn't joke Peralta.

02:01.523 --> 02:03.582
That's it, you're under arrest.

02:03.592 --> 02:04.858
Case closed?

02:04.893 --> 02:07.060
If we don't find
something conclusive,

02:07.095 --> 02:08.261
it jeopardizes the case

02:08.262 --> 02:09.963
and opens the department up
to a lawsuit.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.298
So cancel your plans.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.600
We're here
until this is over.

02:12.634 --> 02:14.935
- Damn it, Peralta.
- Ow!

02:14.969 --> 02:16.270
I know everyone's mad
at Peralta

02:16.271 --> 02:19.606
for ruining their weekend.

02:19.607 --> 02:20.640
But?

02:20.674 --> 02:21.808
That was it.

02:21.809 --> 02:22.942
I was just demonstrating

02:22.943 --> 02:25.846
for Detective Peralta
what a fact is.

02:46.829 --> 02:48.095
Terry, you just
pulled two doubles.

02:48.096 --> 02:49.697
You must be tired.

02:49.698 --> 02:51.132
I'll stay
for this Whitman debacle.

02:51.133 --> 02:52.767
- You go home.
- I'm not tired.

02:52.768 --> 02:54.668
Why would you think
I was tired?

03:05.414 --> 03:06.781
I ended up doing
25 minutes

03:06.782 --> 03:10.484
of sleep chin-ups
on muscle memory alone.

03:10.519 --> 03:11.685
Tired Terry still
gets after it,

03:11.686 --> 03:13.487
that's all I'm saying.

03:13.521 --> 03:14.721
Hey, Gina, can you

03:14.722 --> 03:16.355
order food for us
at the flatbush diner?

03:16.356 --> 03:17.757
They make the best pies
in New York City.

03:17.791 --> 03:19.992
Oopsie, you said something
super dumb.

03:19.993 --> 03:22.662
The best pie
in the city's at crust.

03:22.696 --> 03:23.929
Wrong.
Ignorant and wrong.

03:23.930 --> 03:26.198
Uh, you think you can
just bully people,

03:26.199 --> 03:28.768
but you can't.
It's not okay.

03:28.769 --> 03:31.237
I'm the bully around here,
ask anyone.

03:31.271 --> 03:34.374
Boyle, you're always blogging
on that foodie website.

03:34.408 --> 03:35.742
Which pie's better?

03:35.743 --> 03:37.444
Yeah, whose do you like better,
mine or Rosa's?

03:37.445 --> 03:39.880
Oh, uh, you know,
I-I haven't

03:39.881 --> 03:42.716
been to either place yet.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.050
Why is your eye twitching?

03:44.085 --> 03:46.820
Wouldn't you like to know?

03:46.821 --> 03:49.022
Could I see you for a second
in the evidence lockup?

03:49.056 --> 03:51.191
Charles, I know
what's going on.

03:51.225 --> 03:52.659
You've tried both pies.

03:52.693 --> 03:54.461
You know mine is better.

03:54.462 --> 03:56.296
But you're scared
to tell Rosa,

03:56.297 --> 03:57.731
'cause you're into her.

03:57.766 --> 03:59.066
What?

03:59.067 --> 04:02.904
That is not true, okay?

04:02.938 --> 04:04.873
I-I-I don't even like food.

04:04.907 --> 04:06.942
- What?
- Who's Rosa?

04:06.976 --> 04:08.911
Y-you're the scared one.

04:11.615 --> 04:13.182
Planning your strategy?

04:13.216 --> 04:16.218
No, I'm just making
funny faces at him.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.387
This mirrored glass
is awesome.

04:18.421 --> 04:20.723
It straight-up works.

04:20.757 --> 04:22.558
An effective use
of your limited time.

04:22.592 --> 04:25.060
It is, actually.
That's how I got him last time.

04:25.061 --> 04:27.230
Let him stew for a little bit,
got in his head,

04:27.231 --> 04:28.431
and he confessed.

04:28.465 --> 04:31.201
- You better be right.
- I am.

04:31.202 --> 04:33.436
Hey, make some funny faces
while I'm in there.

04:33.437 --> 04:36.139
I wanna see if I can tell.

04:38.775 --> 04:40.410
I didn't do anything, joke.

04:43.681 --> 04:45.382
That's funny.

04:45.416 --> 04:47.617
You said the exact
same thing last time.

04:47.652 --> 04:49.553
And how'd that
work out for you?

04:49.588 --> 04:51.155
Let's take a look.

04:51.189 --> 04:54.525
Okay. Here's you
at your trial.

04:54.526 --> 04:56.160
You in prison.

04:56.161 --> 04:58.095
Me meeting Regis philbin.

04:58.096 --> 04:59.963
That was fun.

04:59.998 --> 05:01.465
You still in prison.

05:01.466 --> 05:04.502
Me at splash mountain,
just pepper these in here.

05:04.503 --> 05:06.070
You in prison,
you in prison,

05:06.071 --> 05:07.238
you in prison,
you get it.

05:07.272 --> 05:09.273
- You got the wrong guy.
- All right.

05:09.307 --> 05:11.175
Not ready to confess?

05:11.176 --> 05:13.443
Fine by me.

05:13.444 --> 05:16.280
I got all the time
in the world.

05:16.281 --> 05:19.183
No, you actually
have 48 hours.

05:19.184 --> 05:21.419
I know the law.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.922
Nuh-uh.

05:23.956 --> 05:27.392
So looks like we're gonna
be here for a while.

05:27.426 --> 05:30.128
Should someone
do a coffee run?

05:30.129 --> 05:32.999
You know what?
Coffee's on me.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.500
Oh, but no froofy frappuccinos
or anything,

05:35.501 --> 05:37.302
I've only got, like,
10 bucks.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.636
Okay.

05:40.907 --> 05:44.209
Rise and shine, detectives,
rise and shine.

05:44.210 --> 05:46.211
Peralta, I want you
to bring everyone up to speed.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.279
You slept in your office,
and you look

05:48.314 --> 05:50.016
exactly the same.
How?

05:50.048 --> 05:51.916
What are you talking about?
My hair is a mess.

05:51.950 --> 05:54.452
Oh, yeah.
Briefing room, five minutes.

05:54.453 --> 05:56.754
How long were we asleep?

05:56.755 --> 05:59.691
Just long enough for me
to squeeze in quick workout.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.060
So, like, three hours.

06:02.061 --> 06:03.495
- Morning.
-  Ugh.

06:03.496 --> 06:05.130
I can't believe
you live nearby

06:05.131 --> 06:06.732
and you won't let anyone crash
at your place.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.001
You people already know
too much about me.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.702
I know exactly
three facts about you,

06:10.703 --> 06:12.037
and one of them
is that you won't

06:12.038 --> 06:13.772
let any of us crash
at your place.

06:13.773 --> 06:14.973
Is that a nightgown?

06:14.974 --> 06:16.042
That's mine.

06:16.075 --> 06:18.276
It's a t-shirt
from my fat phase.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.878
"If at first
you don't secede,

06:20.913 --> 06:22.613
try try again."

06:22.614 --> 06:25.116
When you're that big,
you buy anything that fits.

06:25.150 --> 06:27.719
A lot of fat guy clothes
have racist overtones.

06:27.753 --> 06:29.721
Okay, a couple
of quick announcements.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.191
First, I met
our night janitor Ronald.

06:32.192 --> 06:35.528
If any of you are missing
hand sanitizer, he drank it.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.064
Second, our warrants
finally went through.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.000
We gotta place Whitman
at the scene and prove

06:40.001 --> 06:42.302
that he either possessed
or sold those diamonds.

06:42.303 --> 06:43.536
I know you're all tired,

06:43.537 --> 06:44.938
but don't forget
why we're here.

06:44.939 --> 06:46.673
Because we're
dedicated detectives.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.274
- Because Peralta jumped the gun.
- Yep.

06:48.309 --> 06:50.877
Get to work.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.612
So we both
had good answers.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.814
This isn't a joke.
You're ruining our weekend.

06:54.849 --> 06:57.117
Okay, I'm sorry you had
to cancel dinner with your dad.

06:57.151 --> 06:58.919
Date.
I had a date.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.088
Hey, if Jake says
the guy did it,

07:01.089 --> 07:02.923
that usually means
the guy did it.

07:02.957 --> 07:04.558
Thank you.
Everyone listen to Rosa.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.592
No, I'm still
furious at you.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.793
Okay, no one
listen to Rosa.

07:06.828 --> 07:08.762
She's clearly an accomplice
to this crime.

07:08.763 --> 07:10.731
I'm gonna go take
another crack at Whitman.

07:10.765 --> 07:12.032
You've been in there,
like, five times.

07:12.033 --> 07:13.100
What are you gonna do?

07:13.101 --> 07:14.134
Annoy him into talking?

07:14.168 --> 07:15.635
Ha, ha.

07:15.670 --> 07:17.270
Two, three, four.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.275
Aah!

07:27.015 --> 07:28.716
Didn't work.

07:28.717 --> 07:30.384
Thank you.
Did not work.

07:33.052 --> 07:34.819
Hey, Captain.

07:34.853 --> 07:36.186
Will you please
let everyone else go?

07:36.187 --> 07:37.721
I feel bad
that I ruined their weekend,

07:37.722 --> 07:39.290
and I can tell
they're pissed at me.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.625
I mean, Charles hasn't tried
to high-five me all morning.

07:41.659 --> 07:43.060
Yes, I've taken
the brunt of that.

07:43.061 --> 07:45.729
Kitchen buds.

07:45.730 --> 07:47.364
Are you sure
Whitman did it?

07:47.399 --> 07:48.799
Yes, I'm positive.

07:48.834 --> 07:50.201
Then the whole team stays.

07:50.202 --> 07:52.403
We have a better shot
with everyone on it.

07:52.404 --> 07:54.238
Fine, will you at least
tell Hitchcock to go home?

07:54.273 --> 07:56.540
His mouth smells like
rotten trout milk.

07:56.575 --> 07:57.708
Is there such a thing?

07:57.742 --> 07:59.042
I'm just telling you
what it smells like.

07:59.077 --> 08:00.511
Get out.

08:00.545 --> 08:03.313
- Do you have the bank records?
- Mm-hmm.

08:03.314 --> 08:05.549
Good thing I didn't reschedule
my date for tonight.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.350
We're never leaving here.

08:07.385 --> 08:08.885
Well, maybe that's
a good thing, you know?

08:08.886 --> 08:10.820
Saved you from another
lame Internet date

08:10.855 --> 08:15.792
with some lame guy named dirk
or mar... garine.

08:15.793 --> 08:17.494
He's not lame, okay?

08:17.495 --> 08:18.895
He works
with a friend of mine.

08:18.896 --> 08:20.263
He has a human name.

08:20.264 --> 08:21.698
And I'm not telling you
what it is,

08:21.699 --> 08:23.367
because you'll look him up
and make fun of him.

08:23.368 --> 08:25.635
I can't believe you think
so little of me

08:25.636 --> 08:27.837
that you would just
automatically assume...

08:27.838 --> 08:29.372
Is it Luke Mueller?

08:29.373 --> 08:30.807
How did you do that?

08:30.808 --> 08:32.808
Well, you only have
one friend... Kylie.

08:32.809 --> 08:34.277
And she has
seven male coworkers.

08:34.311 --> 08:36.245
Goatee, goatee,
jaunty fedora,

08:36.280 --> 08:38.214
profile pic is a sunset,

08:38.215 --> 08:40.650
tasmanian devil tattoo,
goatee.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.586
Leaving Luke
as the only viable option.

08:43.621 --> 08:44.787
Well, he's nice,

08:44.788 --> 08:47.323
and he uses proper
punctuation in texts.

08:47.358 --> 08:49.092
- Dreamboat.
- And I wanted to go out with him.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.760
All right. You know what?
Reschedule for tonight.

08:50.761 --> 08:52.495
I promise I will get us
out of here in time.

08:52.529 --> 08:54.230
Fine.
I'm holding you to that.

08:54.264 --> 08:55.498
Where's he taking you?

08:55.532 --> 08:57.266
Terrific, let's get
everyone involved.

08:57.267 --> 08:59.134
Dinner and a movie.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.938
Dinner and a movie
is the perfect first date.

09:02.939 --> 09:04.840
I think the perfect first date
doesn't feel like

09:04.841 --> 09:06.975
a first date at all,
because you've known each other

09:06.976 --> 09:09.377
for a few years,
maybe even work together.

09:09.411 --> 09:11.412
And one night
you're laughing,

09:11.447 --> 09:13.414
and then all of a sudden,
it's just like blammo!

09:13.415 --> 09:15.216
Kissing.

09:15.250 --> 09:18.752
Cheap dinner,
watch basketball, bone down.

09:18.787 --> 09:22.189
So pretty much the same
as what I said.

09:23.424 --> 09:25.492
None of the partials
match Whitman.

09:25.493 --> 09:27.194
If he did it,
he didn't leave any prints.

09:27.228 --> 09:29.096
Maybe he doesn't have any.

09:29.097 --> 09:30.430
Interesting fact
about me...

09:30.431 --> 09:32.466
I once burnt my fingerprints off
on a wok.

09:32.467 --> 09:35.135
Hi, hello.

09:35.169 --> 09:36.436
What are you doing?

09:36.437 --> 09:37.804
Holt said you didn't
have to come in here.

09:37.805 --> 09:39.406
You don't come in on days
you're supposed to work.

09:39.407 --> 09:42.309
Because I'm so nice,
I brought two pies.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.144
One is from crust.

09:44.145 --> 09:47.648
And one's also
from flatbush diner.

09:47.649 --> 09:49.883
Hey, you know what
might be fun?

09:49.918 --> 09:52.319
Charles could try them
and tell us which one is better.

09:52.354 --> 09:53.587
How fun is that?

09:53.588 --> 09:55.889
- So fun.
- Yay!

09:55.890 --> 09:58.092
Yum, yum, yum.
Yummy.

09:58.126 --> 10:00.094
You got a second, Captain?

10:00.095 --> 10:04.299
I've got these overtime forms
for you to s...

10:04.333 --> 10:07.736
Are you stifling a yawn?

10:07.737 --> 10:09.805
- No, sir.
- Go home, sergeant.

10:09.806 --> 10:11.006
I'm fine.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.609
And I filled this out.
I just need you to...

10:20.282 --> 10:21.649
Permission to yawn, sir.

10:21.650 --> 10:24.318
Go home.

10:28.790 --> 10:31.425
Please, I'm begging you.

10:31.460 --> 10:34.294
- Oh, fair enough.
- Yeah.

10:34.295 --> 10:36.363
That's for women.

10:38.366 --> 10:40.901
- These your glasses?
- Mm-hmm.

10:40.936 --> 10:41.935
They're gigantic.

10:41.936 --> 10:43.704
My contacts dried out,
thanks to you.

10:43.705 --> 10:46.306
And they're cool.
No, they're not.

10:46.307 --> 10:48.609
Wow, you are blind blind.

10:48.643 --> 10:50.678
- Yeah.
- You're a blind cop.

10:50.679 --> 10:52.246
How has there not been
a made-for-TV movie

10:52.247 --> 10:54.115
about your struggles?
Give those back.

10:54.116 --> 10:56.717
Yeah, okay.

10:56.718 --> 10:58.853
Wait a minute.

10:58.887 --> 11:00.354
I did it.

11:00.389 --> 11:01.956
I got Whitman,
dead to rights.

11:01.990 --> 11:04.092
I can still make my date?
As I promised.

11:04.093 --> 11:05.593
Go get changed.

11:05.594 --> 11:06.861
And by that,
of course I mean

11:06.862 --> 11:08.129
throw your glasses
in the garbage,

11:08.130 --> 11:09.597
then get laser surgery,

11:09.632 --> 11:12.067
then recuperate...
And she left the room.

11:14.303 --> 11:16.271
It's all right.
6 out of 12.

11:16.305 --> 11:17.505
Out of 12? Why?

11:17.506 --> 11:19.540
For the 12 components
of food satisfaction:

11:19.541 --> 11:23.178
Salty, sweet, sour,
bitter, umami, odor, sound...

11:23.179 --> 11:25.013
Sound?
Come on, Charles.

11:25.014 --> 11:27.715
Try her nasty pie.

11:31.453 --> 11:33.120
Oh, wow.

11:33.121 --> 11:34.721
That's the best pie
I ever had.

11:34.755 --> 11:36.823
No, no.

11:36.824 --> 11:38.224
- No, no, no.
- What's this?

11:38.259 --> 11:40.727
We were running calls
to pawn shops

11:40.728 --> 11:42.029
and then waiting for them
to call back.

11:42.030 --> 11:43.964
I didn't ask
what you were doing.

11:43.965 --> 11:45.899
I asked
what you are doing.

11:45.933 --> 11:48.435
Pie taste test, it's over.
I won.

11:48.436 --> 11:49.769
That's unacceptable.

11:49.770 --> 11:52.538
If you wanna know which
restaurant has better pies,

11:52.539 --> 11:56.175
you can't just have one guy
try one pie from each place.

11:56.176 --> 11:58.377
Everybody needs to try

11:58.378 --> 12:01.514
all the pies
from both places.

12:01.548 --> 12:05.184
We gonna be here awhile.

12:05.185 --> 12:06.953
Debit card statement.

12:06.954 --> 12:08.121
You were at a parking meter

12:08.122 --> 12:09.355
two blocks
from the jewelry store

12:09.356 --> 12:11.324
an hour before the robbery.

12:11.325 --> 12:15.595
Oh, no, you found out...
About my wife.

12:15.596 --> 12:17.997
We both have cards, because
we share a joint account,

12:17.998 --> 12:19.332
because we love each other.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.233
You're incapable of love,
and I'll prove it!

12:21.234 --> 12:22.434
Oh, I'm very tired.

12:22.435 --> 12:24.270
I want my lawyer, now.

12:24.304 --> 12:26.873
Ugh!

12:26.908 --> 12:28.008
You have changed.

12:28.009 --> 12:29.843
You used to go
straight to prison!

12:29.877 --> 12:31.711
Did Whitman talk?

12:31.745 --> 12:33.780
Oh, he talked all right.

12:33.781 --> 12:35.115
He asked for his lawyer.

12:35.149 --> 12:38.885
By using words,
which is technically talking.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.320
We can't ask him
any more questions

12:40.321 --> 12:41.455
till we find his lawyer,

12:41.489 --> 12:42.956
and we can't find
his lawyer anywhere.

12:42.957 --> 12:44.725
I'm sorry.

12:44.726 --> 12:46.093
Aah, come on.

12:46.094 --> 12:47.794
Why is there pie here?

12:47.795 --> 12:50.063
That's not good.

12:50.097 --> 12:51.298
I think the world of you,

12:51.332 --> 12:52.600
as a colleague
and friend.

12:52.601 --> 12:53.901
- Shut up, Peralta.
-  Yep.

12:56.293 --> 12:58.027
- Yes!
- Another one for crust.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.230
It's not looking good
for flatbush diner.

13:00.231 --> 13:01.965
Ah, come on!

13:01.999 --> 13:03.033
You went home and showered?

13:03.034 --> 13:04.434
That's so unfair.

13:04.468 --> 13:06.836
I'm just glad I keep a toothbrush here.
Oh, cool.

13:06.871 --> 13:08.138
Hey, can I borrow it?

13:08.172 --> 13:10.040
Uh, why do you wanna
borrow the toothbrush?

13:10.041 --> 13:11.041
What possible answer
could he give

13:11.042 --> 13:12.275
that would make you say yes?

13:12.276 --> 13:13.343
I wanna brush my teeth.

13:13.377 --> 13:14.978
Jake, it's been
in my mouth.

13:15.012 --> 13:16.346
That's the grossest thing
I've ever heard.

13:16.347 --> 13:17.414
That's the grossest thing
you've ever heard?

13:17.448 --> 13:18.682
You caught a guy
on the subway

13:18.716 --> 13:20.417
with a bag of human ears.

13:20.452 --> 13:21.652
Your thing's grosser.

13:21.686 --> 13:22.853
Bring out the meringues.

13:22.854 --> 13:25.556
I brought a few more.
That's so many.

13:27.492 --> 13:28.532
You wanted something, sir?

13:28.560 --> 13:30.428
Look, it's impossible
to make you leave.

13:30.429 --> 13:33.364
But you do have to sleep,
and that's an order.

13:33.365 --> 13:36.001
Sir, this is not necessary.

13:36.035 --> 13:39.104
Also, can't sleep
without my whale songs.

13:39.105 --> 13:40.672
Terry, I've seen this before.

13:40.706 --> 13:43.441
Problems at home,
so you stay late at the job,

13:43.442 --> 13:44.976
but that only
makes it worse.

13:45.010 --> 13:47.145
Everything's great
with my wife.

13:47.146 --> 13:49.014
It's just,
my brother-in-law's in town,

13:49.015 --> 13:51.850
and we do not get along.

13:51.851 --> 13:54.419
- He thinks I'm a weakling.
- You?

13:56.055 --> 13:57.823
Let me get that for you.

13:57.824 --> 14:00.258
I can do it.

14:00.259 --> 14:04.128
Tiny Terry
loves his pickles.

14:04.129 --> 14:06.030
He makes me feel so small.

14:06.065 --> 14:07.732
Who cares what he thinks?

14:07.733 --> 14:10.535
You're a police sergeant.
You're a grown man.

14:10.536 --> 14:12.170
Now take your nap.

14:12.171 --> 14:13.405
And if I see
the lights on in here,

14:13.406 --> 14:16.241
I'm gonna be
very disappointed in you.

14:19.112 --> 14:20.979
Are you the idiot that made
a Friday night arrest?

14:20.980 --> 14:22.581
I was in the poconos
with my wife.

14:22.582 --> 14:23.882
You ruined
my entire weekend.

14:23.917 --> 14:26.752
Get in line, because
that's their attitude.

14:26.753 --> 14:28.354
Get your own attitude.

14:28.355 --> 14:31.424
He has an alibi, geniuses.
He was at torque.

14:31.425 --> 14:33.966
It's a nightclub in cape may,
New Jersey, all night.

14:33.967 --> 14:34.994
Nice try.

14:35.028 --> 14:36.362
You think I'm gonna
waste six hours

14:36.363 --> 14:38.931
driving to the Jersey Shore
and back on some fake alibi?

14:38.965 --> 14:40.232
It's up to you.

14:40.233 --> 14:43.468
But in ten hours,
he walks.

14:44.703 --> 14:48.507
More like in ten hours,
he walks into prison,

14:48.508 --> 14:49.708
when we bust him.

14:49.742 --> 14:51.210
Let's follow up
on his alibi.

14:51.211 --> 14:53.479
- Yep, you heard him, Scully, hit the road.
- No.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.713
You should've looked
into this

14:54.714 --> 14:56.715
before you made the arrest.
You go.

14:56.716 --> 14:57.816
Oh, Captain,
I'm happy to go.

14:57.851 --> 14:59.252
I love the saltwater taffy
down there.

14:59.286 --> 15:00.586
Scully loves
the saltwater taffy down there.

15:00.620 --> 15:02.955
No, Peralta's going.
Go, Peralta.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.257
Look, I know I caused
this problem, but I can fix it.

15:05.258 --> 15:06.926
We just got
some new security footage in.

15:06.927 --> 15:08.288
Let me stay here
and go through it.

15:08.295 --> 15:10.429
I'm gonna prove that Whitman
was at the scene of the crime,

15:10.463 --> 15:12.298
even if it kills me.

15:12.332 --> 15:14.200
This is killing me.

15:14.201 --> 15:16.768
Good. Die.

15:16.769 --> 15:19.838
You know,
if it does come to that,

15:19.839 --> 15:23.576
I have but one wish
before I go.

15:23.610 --> 15:25.111
Can I please put your glasses
on my penis?

15:25.112 --> 15:28.181
I just think
that would be really funny.

15:28.215 --> 15:30.416
Hey,
can you make copies

15:30.417 --> 15:31.617
of these warrant requests
for me?

15:31.652 --> 15:33.252
I'm not your secretary.

15:33.287 --> 15:34.887
You're everyone's secretary.

15:34.888 --> 15:36.656
That's literally your job.

15:36.657 --> 15:39.058
And your job is lying
about your taste buds?

15:40.360 --> 15:41.861
I'm sorry about
the whole pie blowup thing.

15:41.862 --> 15:42.962
You're right.

15:42.963 --> 15:44.797
The flatbush diner pie
is awful.

15:44.831 --> 15:48.168
- Thank you.
- It's just...

15:48.169 --> 15:49.836
I want Rosa to like me.

15:49.871 --> 15:52.106
All right,
do whatever you want,

15:52.107 --> 15:54.242
but most women
don't really like it

15:54.243 --> 15:56.945
when dudes lie to them.

15:56.979 --> 15:59.181
Except for me,
but I'm wired

15:59.182 --> 16:02.084
to thrive on dysfunction.

16:02.118 --> 16:04.619
Nothing.

16:04.654 --> 16:07.521
Wait, wait, wait. This guy...
5'9 " or 5'10",

16:07.522 --> 16:08.689
black knit cap.

16:08.723 --> 16:10.177
Come on, come on, come on.

16:10.192 --> 16:11.846
Gotcha!

16:11.860 --> 16:15.229
Ugh, it's not him.

16:15.264 --> 16:18.499
Let's just arrest this guy.
Who even cares anymore?

16:18.534 --> 16:21.002
So how'd my new best friend
Luke take it

16:21.003 --> 16:22.203
when you
cancelled on him again?

16:22.237 --> 16:25.539
Don't know,
hasn't called me back.

16:25.540 --> 16:26.907
Which is
what always happens,

16:26.908 --> 16:29.944
because it's impossible
to be a cop and date.

16:29.978 --> 16:33.147
Amy, look.
There is a guy out there

16:33.148 --> 16:35.015
with incredibly low standards

16:35.016 --> 16:37.385
and a super weird
soul patch,

16:37.419 --> 16:39.387
and he is waiting for you.

16:39.421 --> 16:43.491
Amy, my patch
tingles for you.

16:43.525 --> 16:46.494
We will wed on the isle
of New Jersey.

16:46.528 --> 16:48.629
Our first dance will be
to jessie's girl,

16:48.630 --> 16:51.331
because my name
is definitely jessie.

16:51.332 --> 16:52.700
- It's so romantic.
- Hey, guys.

16:52.701 --> 16:53.934
Hey.

16:53.935 --> 16:56.270
Yeah, there's good news,
and there's bad news.

16:56.304 --> 16:59.940
The bad news is my saltwater
taffy place was closed.

16:59.941 --> 17:01.240
And the good news?

17:01.241 --> 17:02.741
Whitman's alibi
checked out.

17:02.776 --> 17:05.711
Security footage from torque
shows he was there.

17:05.712 --> 17:07.380
That's not good news.

17:07.414 --> 17:10.516
- That's bad news.
- Right. That is bad news.

17:10.517 --> 17:12.617
Sorry, it's on me.

17:12.618 --> 17:14.486
No, Detective Scully,
it's on Peralta.

17:14.521 --> 17:18.290
No, Captain,
that's on Santiago.

17:18.290 --> 17:20.358
It's on me.
It's still on me.

17:22.294 --> 17:23.895
This is such a disaster.

17:23.929 --> 17:26.297
It's not good.
D.A.'s furious.

17:26.298 --> 17:28.032
Whitman and his lawyer
are in my office right now,

17:28.034 --> 17:30.502
gunning for a lawsuit.
No, not that.

17:30.536 --> 17:32.771
My brother-in-law is coming
to have dinner with me

17:32.772 --> 17:35.440
on his way to jfk.

17:37.143 --> 17:41.480
But also the botched
investigation, that's bad too.

17:43.983 --> 17:45.283
Okay, what can I do?

17:45.318 --> 17:48.453
Oh, your services
will not be necessary,

17:48.454 --> 17:50.822
because you need to go home
and change for your date.

17:50.823 --> 17:52.757
- What?
- I called handsome Luke.

17:52.758 --> 17:54.326
I explained the weekend
was entirely

17:54.327 --> 17:55.660
my fault, partially.

17:55.661 --> 17:57.062
And he wants to go out
with you tonight.

17:57.096 --> 17:59.665
- Thanks, Peralta.
- You're welcome.

17:59.700 --> 18:00.800
Just promise me you won't
use the condoms

18:00.801 --> 18:02.234
in the secret pocket
of your purse, okay?

18:02.235 --> 18:04.203
- They're expired.
- How do you know what's in my purse?

18:04.237 --> 18:06.005
I needed concealer
for a zit.

18:06.039 --> 18:09.341
Plus, you know, we spend
so much time together here,

18:09.342 --> 18:11.343
I know everything
about everyone.

18:11.344 --> 18:14.146
I know Hitchcock
went bald at 15.

18:14.147 --> 18:16.214
Scully used to date
Hitchcock's wife.

18:16.215 --> 18:18.450
Charles has a bike with
a little basket on the front.

18:18.451 --> 18:20.051
How else would you
carry baguettes?

18:20.052 --> 18:22.621
And Rosa has a shower
in her apartment, I think.

18:22.622 --> 18:24.089
I got nothing on her.

18:24.090 --> 18:25.223
Good.

18:25.258 --> 18:27.459
Well, I guess we did
just spend 48 hours

18:27.460 --> 18:30.396
locked in here together.

18:32.833 --> 18:34.600
Holy crap.

18:34.601 --> 18:36.402
- What?
- Locked in here together.

18:36.436 --> 18:38.471
So we will be filing
a wrongful arrest suit

18:38.472 --> 18:40.272
against the NYPD.

18:40.307 --> 18:43.709
And when I win,
I'm gonna buy club torque,

18:43.710 --> 18:44.810
put a statue of Jake Peralta

18:44.811 --> 18:46.212
right in the middle
of the dance floor.

18:46.213 --> 18:48.314
First off,
that's a terrible threat.

18:48.315 --> 18:49.749
I would love to have
a statue of myself

18:49.750 --> 18:51.083
in the middle
of a dance club.

18:51.084 --> 18:52.384
Second...

18:52.385 --> 18:53.819
Do me a favor,
take a look at this picture,

18:53.820 --> 18:55.020
and tell me what you see.

18:55.055 --> 18:56.923
You and Regis philbin.

18:56.957 --> 18:58.124
Awesome, right?

18:58.125 --> 18:59.459
Surprisingly
down-to-earth guy

18:59.460 --> 19:01.227
and definitely not the picture
I meant to show you.

19:01.228 --> 19:02.796
But take a look at this.

19:02.797 --> 19:06.033
That's right, it's you and
your old cell mate Marcus Cole.

19:06.100 --> 19:09.270
And here he is again
outside the jewelry store.

19:09.304 --> 19:11.005
The two of you planned this
together in prison.

19:11.006 --> 19:12.407
You taught him your m.O,

19:12.408 --> 19:13.741
he pulled off the robbery,

19:13.742 --> 19:16.511
you got yourself an alibi,
and you split the loot.

19:16.545 --> 19:19.180
Oh, man, I can't believe
he caught us.

19:19.181 --> 19:20.415
Of course he did,

19:20.416 --> 19:21.616
Peralta is the best!

19:21.617 --> 19:23.384
Aw, thanks, reg.
That's enough.

19:23.385 --> 19:24.652
Yeah, I gotta work
on my Regis.

19:24.653 --> 19:25.987
Anyway, see ya in jail,
Whitman.

19:26.021 --> 19:28.456
You got anything else
to say?

19:29.792 --> 19:32.828
Hey, Rosa, the flatbush diner's
pie is terrible.

19:32.829 --> 19:34.096
It's inedible.

19:34.097 --> 19:35.564
Food is supposed
to be edible.

19:35.599 --> 19:36.699
So you were lying?

19:36.700 --> 19:39.135
What the hell, Boyle?

19:39.136 --> 19:41.471
Put it
in the suck-it bucket.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.539
Crust isn't any better.

19:43.574 --> 19:46.275
It's fancier, but it's
all bells and whistles.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.811
Desserts don't need
to be clever.

19:48.845 --> 19:50.580
They just need to be good.

19:50.581 --> 19:54.317
This is the best pie
in New York City...

19:54.318 --> 19:59.356
Apple from argos bakery,
founded 1910.

19:59.357 --> 20:02.526
Recipe unchanged.
Taste it.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.965
Damn, it is amazing.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.766
This pie is so good,
I hate it.

20:09.767 --> 20:11.568
You just graduated
pie school, bitches.

20:11.569 --> 20:14.171
Sorry I said "bitches,"
I'm just really worked up.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.073
Yow!
Mmm, what is that?

20:16.108 --> 20:19.076
Sorry for screwing up
everyone's weekend.

20:19.111 --> 20:22.780
Hey, uh, drinks on me.
Who's in?

20:22.781 --> 20:24.248
Oh, no way.
No, I got the date. I gotta change.

20:24.283 --> 20:26.651
- Come on.
- Everyone's tired, Peralta.

20:26.652 --> 20:28.019
They just wanna go home.

20:28.053 --> 20:29.720
Yeah, but I have to prove
I'm not selfish,

20:29.721 --> 20:30.922
so I don't care
what they want.

20:30.923 --> 20:33.124
That sounded bad.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.027
And to make up
for what I did, I'll cover

20:37.061 --> 20:38.061
one shift each
for all of you.

20:38.062 --> 20:39.363
No kidding?

20:39.364 --> 20:40.798
- Except Santiago.
- What?

20:40.799 --> 20:41.999
I got you your date back.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.169
One nice thing from me
is all you get.

20:45.170 --> 20:47.438
So this is my desk.

20:47.439 --> 20:48.739
Desk jockey, huh?

20:48.740 --> 20:51.142
You just sit here,
eat your pickles,

20:51.176 --> 20:52.877
wait for the criminals
to turn themselves in.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.412
Actually, I don't like
pickles that much.

20:54.413 --> 20:55.913
Terry, I'm glad
I found you.

20:55.948 --> 20:58.015
There's been a development
in the Russian mob case.

20:58.016 --> 20:59.417
Oh?
Yeah, our killer

20:59.451 --> 21:00.651
has been spotted
in the warehouse

21:00.652 --> 21:02.319
down by the canal.
Get your gear.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.321
So you want me first
through the door, sir?

21:04.322 --> 21:05.490
Oh, it's just you.

21:05.491 --> 21:07.225
The SWAT team
is on another call,

21:07.259 --> 21:09.427
so you'll have
to do it alone.

21:09.428 --> 21:11.530
Hey, I'm not gonna be able
to make dinner tonight.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.699
Hey, no, do your thing,
do your thing.

21:13.700 --> 21:16.034
Go, Terry.

21:16.035 --> 21:18.505
You can crash
on my couch.

21:18.506 --> 21:21.265
I even downloaded you
some whale songs.

21:21.266 --> 21:23.854
Thank you, sir.
I'll never forget it.

21:27.545 --> 21:29.517
Good night, Terry.
