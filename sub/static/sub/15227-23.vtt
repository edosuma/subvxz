VAGRANT:
  <i>Anybody got any spare change?</i>

01:19.378 --> 01:22.213
Anything left in your pockets
        you don't want?

01:22.281 --> 01:25.249
Old gum? Traveler's checks?

01:25.317 --> 01:27.151
Somebody want to give me
        their clothing?

01:27.219 --> 01:29.387
LOUIE:
Hey, hey!

01:29.455 --> 01:31.022
Hey, come on, no scuzzos
        allowed in here.

01:31.089 --> 01:32.124
Get out, out!

01:32.191 --> 01:33.825
All right.

01:33.893 --> 01:35.827
Goodbye, everybody!

01:35.895 --> 01:37.828
No...

01:37.896 --> 01:39.865
Iggy, Iggy, no, not you.

01:39.932 --> 01:41.032
You're not a scuzzo.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.366
You're an airhead.
We a...

01:42.434 --> 01:44.369
We allow airheads in here.

01:44.436 --> 01:47.371
Come on, hey, scuzz,
              hey, whoa, slither
         out of here, go on, go!

01:47.439 --> 01:50.408
Hey, hey, hey, Louie,
            Louie, Louie, Louie!

01:50.476 --> 01:51.743
Be a little bit
                  more sensitive

01:51.810 --> 01:53.044
to the plight of this man.

01:53.111 --> 01:54.212
He's not a scuzzo.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.081
He happens to be a human
        being with some dignity.

01:56.148 --> 01:57.949
I'm afraid you're
mistaking me

01:58.017 --> 02:01.152
for somebody else.

02:01.220 --> 02:02.186
Wait! Hey, wait.

02:02.254 --> 02:03.521
Wait!

02:03.589 --> 02:07.259
What if I gave you
            $1,000?

02:07.326 --> 02:08.626
Jim, Jim, look,

02:08.693 --> 02:10.461
I know you've inherited
a lot of money,

02:10.529 --> 02:12.230
but, you know,
there is such a thing

02:12.297 --> 02:13.731
as being too soft a touch.

02:13.799 --> 02:17.268
Define "too soft a touch."

02:17.336 --> 02:20.771
It's my money...

02:20.839 --> 02:24.976
and I'll spend it
                 however I want.

02:25.044 --> 02:27.178
Jim...

02:28.948 --> 02:30.047
Take it.

02:36.756 --> 02:39.457
I don't know who you are

02:39.524 --> 02:41.960
and I don't know
       why you did this,

02:42.027 --> 02:43.461
but it's nice to know

02:43.528 --> 02:45.096
there are people like you
         in the world.

02:45.163 --> 02:48.966
I mean that
    from one bum to another.

02:58.143 --> 02:59.611
Wow!

02:59.679 --> 03:00.778
Jim, Jim...
      Huh?

03:00.846 --> 03:02.613
Look, if you want
            to be that generous,

03:02.681 --> 03:05.350
why don't you give it
         to organized charities?

03:05.417 --> 03:07.952
I do, but when
I give away $1,000

03:08.020 --> 03:11.322
like I just did,
it's not charity.

03:11.390 --> 03:15.192
I do it out of
selfishness.

03:15.260 --> 03:18.296
To experience
the joy you get

03:18.364 --> 03:21.065
when you personally
hand over money

03:21.133 --> 03:23.969
that's gonna make a person's
life a little better.

03:24.036 --> 03:25.970
You sound like you
                  do this a lot.

03:26.037 --> 03:27.805
Oh, no, not a lot.

03:27.873 --> 03:33.978
Like, today, I'm only gonna
     do it five more times.

03:34.046 --> 03:36.147
Oh, now, wait a minute,
                  wait a minute.

03:36.215 --> 03:39.217
Jim, look, I don't care
      how much money you've got.

03:39.284 --> 03:41.419
Now, uh, this is stupid.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.421
This is stup-- this is
         cra-- this is reckless,

03:43.489 --> 03:44.755
this is irresponsible

03:44.823 --> 03:47.191
and I'm not gonna
       let you go on doing this.

03:47.259 --> 03:48.392
Even if it means

03:48.460 --> 03:50.028
calling the administers
                 of your estate,

03:50.095 --> 03:51.696
I'm not gonna let
                 you do it, Jim.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.298
Oh, this is different.

03:53.365 --> 03:54.665
This is helping people.

03:54.733 --> 03:56.100
Oh, come on, Jim,
                       will you?

03:56.168 --> 03:58.369
Go ahead, call my lawyers
                    if you want.
I'm gonna do it!

03:58.437 --> 04:00.672
You wouldn't say
       those things to me

04:00.739 --> 04:02.907
if you really knew
       what it was like.

04:02.975 --> 04:04.242
(unhooking phone)
              Wait a minute!

04:05.444 --> 04:08.380
What if you found out
       what it was like?

04:08.447 --> 04:10.915
What if I gave you
                $1,000?

04:12.918 --> 04:18.356
What if I gave
         all of you $1,000...

04:18.423 --> 04:20.358
to give to one person

04:20.426 --> 04:23.328
before the end of the shift?

04:23.396 --> 04:25.262
Then if you come back
             and say to me

04:25.330 --> 04:28.266
that it was stupid
         and crazy, I'll stop.

04:30.669 --> 04:32.603
What do you say, Alex?

04:34.340 --> 04:35.273
Come on.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.740
If you promise to stop!

04:36.808 --> 04:40.945
Yes, you passionate
             son of a gun.

04:42.314 --> 04:45.883
Here you go, Alex.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.753
Elaine.
                      (giggling)

04:49.821 --> 04:53.324
Well, it sounds like
               a fair challenge.

04:53.392 --> 04:57.829
People down on their luck
   get into my cab every day.

04:57.896 --> 05:00.164
The next guy that gets in
   and tells me his troubles

05:00.232 --> 05:02.566
is in for a big surprise.

05:02.634 --> 05:04.068
You know, I think, uh, I know,

05:04.136 --> 05:06.170
I know somebody
      I can give this to.

05:06.237 --> 05:07.872
Can the one person
     I give this money to,

05:07.940 --> 05:09.374
can it be one of my kids?

05:09.442 --> 05:11.376
Why not?

05:11.443 --> 05:13.378
Give it to one of your kids.

05:13.446 --> 05:14.545
That's great!

05:14.613 --> 05:16.514
(squeals)
           Thank you!

05:17.916 --> 05:20.251
Here you go, Latka.

05:20.319 --> 05:24.055
Oh...

05:24.123 --> 05:26.524
The tradition of my country
forces me to protest.

05:26.592 --> 05:28.026
Come on, take the money.

05:28.094 --> 05:32.129
Oh, I'll take the money,
but first I have to protest.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.801
No, no, no!

05:36.869 --> 05:38.402
I won't take it!

05:38.470 --> 05:39.771
This is an insult!

05:43.608 --> 05:45.609
Thank you very much.

05:46.712 --> 05:49.179
I notice...

05:49.247 --> 05:50.348
(wry laugh)

05:51.850 --> 05:55.386
...you excluded me
  from your little challenge.

05:55.454 --> 05:57.255
You're wrong, boss.

05:57.322 --> 06:01.493
I'm including you
       in this challenge.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.127
Now, wait a minute,
      wait a minute, Jim!

06:03.195 --> 06:04.996
You give a thousand bucks
       to Louie De Palma,

06:05.064 --> 06:07.465
you better be there to see
 that he gives it to somebody.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.900
Yeah.
      Otherwise he's gonna

06:08.968 --> 06:10.735
pocket that money himself
       and lie about it.

06:10.803 --> 06:13.171
Would you do that?

06:13.238 --> 06:14.606
Of course.

06:14.673 --> 06:16.874
No, no, wait, wait,
            wait, hold it!

06:16.941 --> 06:18.376
I want to play, too.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.478
All right?

06:20.546 --> 06:23.948
How about if I give
       the money to Jeff?

06:24.016 --> 06:25.784
This way you
             can check on it.

06:25.851 --> 06:27.952
Okeydoke.

06:31.223 --> 06:35.093
Do you really think...

06:35.160 --> 06:38.463
that me giving away $1,000

06:38.530 --> 06:40.465
is gonna make me feel good?

06:40.533 --> 06:42.133
You think me?

06:42.201 --> 06:43.734
I'm not him, you know.

06:43.802 --> 06:45.135
I'm not him.

06:45.203 --> 06:46.571
I'm not the guy who says,

06:46.638 --> 06:50.107
"Oh, every day,
        somebody gets in my cab

06:50.175 --> 06:53.478
who's down on their luck, ooh."

06:56.181 --> 06:58.649
Whatever you say, boss.

06:58.717 --> 07:01.452
I wish I could be there

07:01.519 --> 07:05.790
to see the expression on your
   face when you give it to him.

07:05.857 --> 07:07.725
Oh, yeah, well you won't
have to wait, Iggy.

07:07.793 --> 07:09.760
You can see it right now.

07:09.828 --> 07:11.662
(yawning)

07:14.733 --> 07:16.233
LATKA:
         <i>Reverend Gorky,</i>

07:16.301 --> 07:20.838
this is a very joyous
      occasion for Simka and me.

07:20.906 --> 07:23.408
We know how little money

07:23.476 --> 07:25.743
our humble church
   is able to pay you.

07:25.810 --> 07:28.746
Ah, I don't complain.

07:28.814 --> 07:34.852
Simka and I would like
       to give to you...

07:34.919 --> 07:37.555
$1,000!

07:37.622 --> 07:39.390
$1,000?
                            Yes.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.859
You are giving me
            $1,000?

07:41.927 --> 07:42.860
Yes.

07:42.928 --> 07:46.497
Stinking lousy $1,000?

07:46.565 --> 07:47.831
How dare you!

07:47.899 --> 07:49.267
I spit on your money!

07:51.403 --> 07:53.838
Thank you very much.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.908
Oh, Reverend Gorky,

07:57.976 --> 07:59.911
I'm very happy
       that you're happy.

07:59.978 --> 08:04.249
Simka, is forwith so wrong?

08:04.316 --> 08:06.117
I wanted that $1,000

08:06.185 --> 08:08.385
so we could afford
        to have a baby.

08:13.425 --> 08:17.195
You are so good-hearted.

08:17.263 --> 08:21.032
Take money to have baby.

08:21.100 --> 08:25.402
You are giving me
         this $1,000?!

08:25.470 --> 08:26.904
No, no, no!

08:26.971 --> 08:28.540
I won't take it!

08:28.607 --> 08:30.741
Wow! Thank you!

08:30.809 --> 08:33.043
God bless you!

08:33.111 --> 08:38.849
Oh, our traditions
               are so beautiful!

08:42.520 --> 08:43.655
(knocking on door)

08:43.722 --> 08:44.855
Who is it?

08:44.923 --> 08:46.257
TONY:
It's Tony!

08:46.325 --> 08:48.559
(TV newscast plays indistinctly)
Tony Banta from down at the gym?

08:48.627 --> 08:49.593
Yeah!

08:49.661 --> 08:51.295
It's not Thursday night, is it?

08:51.362 --> 08:53.597
No, I thought I'd stop
by early this week.

08:53.665 --> 08:55.666
Why didn't you call?

08:55.734 --> 08:57.000
You haven't got a phone!

08:57.068 --> 08:58.535
I meant from the sidewalk.

08:58.603 --> 09:00.404
I <i>do</i> have a window.

09:00.471 --> 09:02.073
Are you gonna
let me in or not?

09:02.141 --> 09:03.507
What are you getting
        so upset about?

09:03.575 --> 09:04.608
NEWSMAN:
    On the national scene--

09:04.676 --> 09:05.810
(TV shuts off)

09:11.483 --> 09:13.951
I wanted to stop by early
'cause I got a surprise for you.

09:14.019 --> 09:15.619
I brought you a gift.

09:17.722 --> 09:19.290
I hope it's chocolates.

09:19.357 --> 09:22.327
(laughing)

09:22.394 --> 09:24.062
Come on, open it up.

09:24.129 --> 09:25.496
I don't want to
                 open it up yet.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.498
Come on, what do you want to
do before you open it?

09:27.566 --> 09:31.436
Talk.

09:31.503 --> 09:33.137
Okay.

09:33.205 --> 09:35.039
Uh, how was
    <i>Days of Our Lives</i> today?

09:35.107 --> 09:36.207
Good, good.

09:36.274 --> 09:37.674
But you know
     what was really great?

09:37.742 --> 09:41.012
<i>Gilligan's Island.</i>

09:41.080 --> 09:45.182
That classic one
 where Gilligan gets hypnotized

09:45.250 --> 09:47.018
and thinks he's Mary Ann.

09:47.085 --> 09:48.886
(laughing)
Yeah, sure.

09:48.953 --> 09:51.355
Boy, the Skipper was really
mad at him that time, huh?

09:51.423 --> 09:53.023
Who wouldn't be?

09:53.091 --> 09:57.028
Cat dressed up like
             a dad-blamed woman.

09:57.095 --> 09:59.430
<i>Bonanza</i> is coming on now.

09:59.498 --> 10:00.965
Would you like to watch it?

10:01.033 --> 10:02.800
Sure.
                     It'll be on
            in a couple seconds.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.034
Okay.

10:04.102 --> 10:07.571
Now this episode, Tony,

10:07.639 --> 10:10.141
is the one where
          Hoss' friend's dog

10:10.208 --> 10:13.044
outsmarts the crooks.

10:13.111 --> 10:14.978
I've watched it
                      100 times.

10:15.046 --> 10:16.780
You know, I'll tell you
something, Walt.

10:16.848 --> 10:18.649
On this old
black-and-white TV set,

10:18.717 --> 10:21.519
I mean, you can't tell how
blue the Ponderosa sky is

10:21.586 --> 10:23.187
or how green the trees are,

10:23.255 --> 10:26.024
or even what shade of brown
Little Joe's horse is.

10:26.091 --> 10:29.060
Hey, what did I ever do to you?

10:29.128 --> 10:31.195
Come on, Walt,
    let's open your present.

10:31.263 --> 10:32.363
Come on.

10:32.430 --> 10:34.198
Come on, I'll help you.

10:45.243 --> 10:48.779
It's yours.

10:48.847 --> 10:53.851
21 inches... great color.

10:53.918 --> 10:57.321
This is it.

10:59.491 --> 11:03.861
Stereo speakers...

11:03.929 --> 11:06.330
and remote control.

11:09.634 --> 11:11.034
Tony...

11:11.102 --> 11:12.970
Hey, come on, Walt.

11:13.038 --> 11:14.404
Don't start getting
teary on me now.

11:14.472 --> 11:15.907
You know, the color's
gonna look blurred.

11:15.974 --> 11:17.341
Come on, sit down.

11:19.311 --> 11:20.277
Sit right here.

11:20.345 --> 11:21.645
There you go.

11:21.713 --> 11:23.981
There, there you go.

11:24.048 --> 11:26.450
Switch that baby on.

11:26.518 --> 11:28.452
Oh...

11:33.458 --> 11:35.659
Pretty good, ain't it?

11:38.163 --> 11:41.766
(crying):
      This is the happiest
        day of my life.

11:41.833 --> 11:44.301
I'll never forget it
       as long as I live.

11:44.369 --> 11:45.803
Hey, Walt, me, too.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.671
I mean, this may be the nicest
 thing that ever happened to me.

11:47.739 --> 11:48.806
I tell you, man,

11:48.874 --> 11:50.174
I just hope that this TV
             gives you plenty...

11:50.242 --> 11:51.375
Shut up, shut up, Tony.

11:51.443 --> 11:52.944
It's starting now.

11:53.011 --> 11:54.378
(Western theme plays on TV)

11:54.446 --> 11:55.946
Okay, Walt.

11:56.014 --> 11:58.082
Hey, I'll see you around;
       I got to finish my shift.

11:58.150 --> 12:01.652
Thursday night, right?
(sniffles)

12:01.720 --> 12:03.354
You bet your life.

12:09.594 --> 12:11.395
And call next time!

12:17.969 --> 12:20.638
ELAINE:
        <i>Jennifer, I have</i>
         <i>to talk to you.</i>

12:20.706 --> 12:22.740
I'm sorry I had to
                wake you, but...

12:22.808 --> 12:24.375
but I have a
                  little problem

12:24.443 --> 12:26.611
and I wanted you
             to help me with it.

12:26.678 --> 12:28.779
Is it men again?

12:29.881 --> 12:30.881
No, honey.

12:30.949 --> 12:32.416
Not this time.

12:32.483 --> 12:35.419
Um, Jennifer...

12:35.487 --> 12:37.889
Jim, down at the garage...

12:37.956 --> 12:41.491
he gave me this $1,000.

12:44.095 --> 12:48.165
Now, he told me I have to
     give it to someone tonight,

12:48.233 --> 12:51.168
and I'd like to give it
        to you and your brother.

12:51.235 --> 12:53.070
But Jason
isn't here tonight.

12:53.138 --> 12:54.471
Right.

12:54.539 --> 12:57.041
So, I'm going to
                 give it to you.

12:57.108 --> 12:59.009
(chuckling)

12:59.077 --> 13:01.913
And I get to keep
all of it?

13:01.980 --> 13:03.915
Well, you probably want

13:03.982 --> 13:06.416
to give half of it to
            your brother, right?

13:06.484 --> 13:08.218
No.

13:09.588 --> 13:10.821
Jennifer, come here.

13:10.889 --> 13:12.657
Come here, baby.

13:12.724 --> 13:14.258
Look...

13:14.326 --> 13:16.160
I gave you this money,

13:16.228 --> 13:17.862
and I'm not going
                to take it back.

13:17.929 --> 13:19.296
I mean, it's your
               money now, and...

13:19.364 --> 13:21.365
and you can do whatever
               you want with it.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.834
You can be sweet...

13:23.902 --> 13:26.169
and generous...

13:26.237 --> 13:28.405
and loving...

13:28.473 --> 13:30.707
and share it with
                   your brother,

13:30.775 --> 13:33.577
or you can be mean

13:33.644 --> 13:36.413
and selfish and greedy

13:36.481 --> 13:38.883
and not share
                    it with him.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.618
It's up to you.

13:40.685 --> 13:43.120
So, what are you
                    going to do?

13:43.187 --> 13:46.924
All right, I'll give
half the money to Jason.

13:48.993 --> 13:50.961
Okay.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.335
Mommy?

13:58.403 --> 14:03.040
Is it okay if I use my $500
   to buy something for you?

14:04.276 --> 14:05.709
(chuckling):
Oh, honey.

14:05.777 --> 14:07.911
That's sweet-- I...

14:07.979 --> 14:10.981
but... but I don't
really need anything.

14:11.048 --> 14:12.983
What would you buy me?

14:13.051 --> 14:15.753
ColecoVision and
                   11 cassettes.

14:19.591 --> 14:21.091
(chuckling):
Sure.

14:25.964 --> 14:27.131
Hey, Lou.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.732
Oh, Jeff, there you are.
                 (clears throat)

14:28.800 --> 14:30.668
Listen, I got
              something for you.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.437
Now, look, I know you could
           use some extra money,

14:33.504 --> 14:35.940
but I'm only doing
          this to prove a point,

14:36.007 --> 14:37.608
so don't get
               weepy on me here.

14:37.676 --> 14:38.808
Now, don't get sappy.

14:38.876 --> 14:41.111
I'm going to make
           this short and sweet.

14:41.179 --> 14:43.280
I'm giving you $1,000.

14:43.348 --> 14:45.349
The hell you are.

14:51.189 --> 14:53.224
LOUIE:
             <i>Jeff...</i>

14:53.292 --> 14:55.092
Jeff, I don't understand.

14:55.159 --> 14:58.095
You need the money,
     so what's the matter?

14:58.163 --> 14:59.897
I don't want your money, Louie.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.033
What's the matter
                  with my money?

15:02.100 --> 15:04.168
It could be dirty money.

15:05.303 --> 15:06.970
I'm not asking you
         to eat off it.

15:07.038 --> 15:09.440
All I'm asking you to do
is put it in your pocket.

15:09.508 --> 15:11.142
Spend it on your
poor grandmother.

15:11.209 --> 15:12.977
No, thanks.

15:13.044 --> 15:14.244
Hey, Jeff.

15:14.312 --> 15:17.047
Did I mention
it's $1,000?

15:18.583 --> 15:20.718
I wouldn't care if it's
       a million dollars, Louie.

15:20.786 --> 15:23.487
I'm not taking any
                 money from <i>you.</i>

15:23.554 --> 15:26.557
If I had a million dollars,
    I'd hire three big guys

15:26.625 --> 15:29.393
to stuff this lousy thousand
       down your throat.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.228
Don't try to sweet-talk me,
             Louie.

15:31.296 --> 15:33.330
I'm not taking your money.

15:34.566 --> 15:35.566
Fine, fine.

15:35.634 --> 15:36.867
You don't have to take it.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.602
I don't have to give it to you.

15:38.670 --> 15:40.237
There's plenty of guys
          who want it.

15:40.305 --> 15:43.140
God help the person
          who takes it from <i>you.</i>

15:44.809 --> 15:46.877
Jeff, are you trying
  to make some statement here?

15:46.945 --> 15:48.546
Frankly, I'm offended.

15:48.613 --> 15:49.880
Louie...

15:49.948 --> 15:52.550
I don't know why you want
          me to take that money.

15:52.617 --> 15:55.753
All I know is, if it's
     coming from Louie De Palma,

15:55.821 --> 15:57.821
there's got to
                     be a catch.

15:57.889 --> 15:59.623
What, what, what
                  kind of catch?

15:59.691 --> 16:00.624
What...?

16:00.692 --> 16:02.025
How would I know?

16:02.093 --> 16:04.728
Maybe it's counterfeit money.
                        (scoffs)

16:04.796 --> 16:07.731
Or maybe it's stolen money
and you want to plant it on me.

16:07.798 --> 16:09.766
Maybe it's
contaminated

16:09.834 --> 16:11.902
from germ warfare,
   and the Russians paid you

16:11.970 --> 16:14.672
to plant it on my body
        as an experiment

16:14.739 --> 16:18.476
to see if I sprout
   some kind of weird fungus.

16:29.554 --> 16:32.422
It's beginning to sound
    like you don't trust me.

16:43.969 --> 16:46.137
(door opens)

16:46.204 --> 16:47.872
Sir, about
how much is it

16:47.939 --> 16:49.506
to the Port Authority
bus station?

16:49.574 --> 16:50.941
I'm on a tight budget.

16:51.009 --> 16:52.375
It's only about
                    three bucks.

16:52.443 --> 16:54.745
Oh.

16:54.813 --> 16:57.648
When the meter hits $2.50,
drop me off.

16:57.716 --> 16:59.216
I'll run the rest
of the way.

16:59.284 --> 17:00.451
Ah, don't worry
                       about it.

17:00.518 --> 17:02.052
I'll take you
                    all the way.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.655
Hope I have enough
for the trip back to Oregon.

17:04.723 --> 17:05.888
Well, if you don't,

17:05.957 --> 17:08.125
you can have them leave
           you off in, uh, Idaho

17:08.193 --> 17:10.894
and you can run the
                rest of the way.

17:10.962 --> 17:13.396
Good-bye, New York!

17:13.464 --> 17:16.967
You chewed me up
      and you spit me out!

17:17.035 --> 17:19.368
MAN (in distance):
   And we're well rid of you!

17:19.436 --> 17:21.472
Gee, this
is a tough town.

17:21.539 --> 17:22.906
Yeah, I know
                      it can be.

17:22.973 --> 17:24.040
(chuckles)

17:24.108 --> 17:26.242
Hey, uh, my
                   name is Alex.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.711
Hi. I'm Jeremy.

17:27.779 --> 17:29.080
Hi.

17:29.147 --> 17:30.347
You look a little upset.

17:30.415 --> 17:31.948
You want to tell me about it?

17:32.016 --> 17:33.450
Nah.

17:33.518 --> 17:36.687
You must hear about people's
hard-luck stories all day long.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.021
Oh, not today.

17:38.089 --> 17:41.358
Today, I am starved
  for a good hard-luck story.

17:42.527 --> 17:45.362
I came to New York
to make it as a cartoonist,

17:45.430 --> 17:48.298
but now I'm broke
and I have to go home to Oregon.

17:48.366 --> 17:50.968
Are you leaving because
  you're broke or because, uh,

17:51.035 --> 17:52.937
you don't think
 you're good enough to make it?

17:53.004 --> 17:55.572
I'm leaving
because I'm broke.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.340
Uh-huh.

17:57.408 --> 18:00.043
Would you mind if I took a look
  at those cartoons of yours?

18:00.111 --> 18:01.178
Sure.

18:01.245 --> 18:03.680
Th-these are political cartoons.

18:03.748 --> 18:06.150
Do... do you like
      political cartoons?

18:06.217 --> 18:07.951
I love political cartoons.
Yeah?

18:08.019 --> 18:10.553
I've loved political cartoons
          all my life.
  Yeah?

18:10.621 --> 18:11.589
Yeah, yeah.
It's nice...

18:11.656 --> 18:13.223
It's nice to run
into one New Yorker

18:13.291 --> 18:15.325
who'll appreciate my work
before I leave.

18:15.393 --> 18:16.927
Well, you know something?

18:16.995 --> 18:21.765
Um, I might be able to do more
than just appreciate your work.

18:21.832 --> 18:22.933
Hey, wait a minute.

18:23.001 --> 18:24.368
Let me... let me...
     let me pull over here,

18:24.435 --> 18:25.869
so I can take a look
       at those properly.

18:25.937 --> 18:27.638
Hold on.

18:30.908 --> 18:32.209
Look at this one of Reagan

18:32.277 --> 18:34.178
sitting next
     to an MX missile silo.

18:34.246 --> 18:35.312
Uh-huh.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.314
Read the caption out loud.

18:37.382 --> 18:39.583
"Nancy, we're late."

18:43.154 --> 18:45.055
I don't think I get it.

18:45.123 --> 18:48.358
Uh, well, you know how she's
   always buying new clothes.

18:48.426 --> 18:49.760
Yeah.

18:49.827 --> 18:51.595
Well?

18:51.662 --> 18:53.196
Yeah?

18:53.264 --> 18:55.198
She's in there changing.

18:55.266 --> 18:57.400
Don't you get it?

18:57.468 --> 18:59.303
Why?

18:59.370 --> 19:01.939
Because, uh, she's run out
of closet space

19:02.007 --> 19:03.941
and he doesn't know where
to put the missile.

19:04.009 --> 19:05.142
(laughing)

19:08.679 --> 19:10.080
What are you, a Republican?

19:10.148 --> 19:11.348
Here, here,
look at...

19:11.416 --> 19:13.617
look at another one.

19:13.684 --> 19:15.286
(chuckling)
           Ah, yeah.

19:15.353 --> 19:17.253
That's Uncle Sam
     and the Russian bear.

19:17.321 --> 19:18.322
(laughing):
Yeah.
             Yeah.

19:18.390 --> 19:19.690
But you don't have a caption.

19:19.757 --> 19:20.858
You, too, huh?

19:20.926 --> 19:22.226
Hmm?

19:22.294 --> 19:23.727
Wh-why does it
need a caption

19:23.795 --> 19:25.495
when they're looking
at each other

19:25.563 --> 19:27.230
with those expressions
on their faces?

19:29.334 --> 19:32.469
You mean you're saying we don't
  get along with the Russians?

19:32.536 --> 19:33.504
Well, there you go.

19:33.572 --> 19:35.472
Was that so hard?

19:39.544 --> 19:42.078
So, what are you going
                to do in Oregon?

19:45.149 --> 19:46.183
(indistinct
         conversation)

19:46.251 --> 19:47.350
Alex!

19:47.418 --> 19:48.918
Alex, Alex, Alex,
    Alex, Alex, Alex.

19:48.986 --> 19:50.354
Well, I did it.

19:50.422 --> 19:51.421
And it worked.

19:51.489 --> 19:52.623
All right!
It worked!

19:52.690 --> 19:54.291
I almost gave that money away
           six times,

19:54.359 --> 19:55.626
and it just didn't seem right.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.528
Then, this little old lady gets
          into my cab.

19:57.595 --> 19:59.530
She's got seven kids and--
    would you believe it?--

19:59.598 --> 20:02.499
the landlady wants to shut
the heat off in their apartment.

20:02.567 --> 20:04.601
Unbelievable.
Well, if you'd
have seen the look

20:04.669 --> 20:08.104
on that lady's face when I
  handed her that 1,100 bucks.

20:08.172 --> 20:09.606
It would've knocked you out!

20:09.674 --> 20:10.808
All right, Alex!
         That's great.

20:10.875 --> 20:12.776
I only gave you
                     a thousand.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.579
Well, a guy can chip in,
          too, right?

20:15.647 --> 20:17.180
Aw.

20:17.248 --> 20:19.516
Did I tell you or
                 did I tell you?

20:19.584 --> 20:20.550
You ain't kidding, boy.

20:20.618 --> 20:22.418
Hey, hey, you can give away
as much money

20:22.486 --> 20:23.854
as you want
from now on.
                        Yeah.

20:23.921 --> 20:25.856
Oh, no, no, no,
            no, no, no, no.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.691
A deal is a deal.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.059
I said I would stop

20:29.127 --> 20:31.028
if any one of you
           didn't agree with me.

20:31.095 --> 20:32.829
And I haven't heard
                 from Louie yet.

20:32.897 --> 20:34.364
ELAINE: Oh, come on, Jim,
             let's go to Mario's
    What are you, kidding?

20:34.432 --> 20:36.467
and celebrate, and you can deal
       with Louie later.

20:36.534 --> 20:38.569
Yeah, come on, let's go.
Come on, come on!

20:40.104 --> 20:41.371
Hey, don't bother
with Louie.

20:41.439 --> 20:43.039
The only thing
that guy ever enjoyed

20:43.107 --> 20:44.841
giving anyone
was hepatitis.

20:46.911 --> 20:51.047
For the last time, Louie,
   I'm not taking the money.

20:51.115 --> 20:53.183
Jeff, Jeff, I told you,

20:53.251 --> 20:55.552
there are no
strings attached.

20:55.619 --> 21:00.223
I told you that I do not want
anything from you in return.

21:00.291 --> 21:01.324
I don't care.

21:01.392 --> 21:03.026
I don't want the money.

21:03.093 --> 21:05.529
All right.
     Jim gave me the money.

21:06.631 --> 21:08.798
He said I had
to give it away.

21:08.866 --> 21:11.067
He's trying to prove
some crazy point

21:11.135 --> 21:14.037
about how good it feels
to give away money.

21:14.105 --> 21:15.238
This is Jim's money?

21:15.306 --> 21:16.706
Yeah, it's Jim's money.

21:16.774 --> 21:18.909
You need it,
 so take it, take it, take it,

21:18.977 --> 21:19.909
take it, take it!

21:19.977 --> 21:21.145
All right,
                   I'll take it!

21:21.212 --> 21:22.379
Thank you.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.881
Ah, geez!

21:24.949 --> 21:27.350
I mean, Iggy said
        I'd feel great.

21:27.418 --> 21:30.153
I said I wouldn't feel anything.

21:30.221 --> 21:34.358
I never imagined that I
would feel like a sack of dirt.

21:37.228 --> 21:39.997
This is something.

21:40.064 --> 21:43.066
I mean, you couldn't believe...

21:43.134 --> 21:47.837
that I wanted to do
         something nice for you.

21:47.905 --> 21:52.275
You couldn't believe
              that I was capable

21:52.343 --> 21:55.678
of doing one
                   decent thing.

21:55.746 --> 21:58.115
You could not believe

21:58.182 --> 22:00.350
that I thought of
                you as a friend.

22:06.257 --> 22:07.390
(slams)

22:18.336 --> 22:20.070
Louie.

22:24.242 --> 22:26.176
I'm sorry.

22:28.313 --> 22:29.813
No, Louie,
                    I-I mean it.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.147
Really.

22:31.215 --> 22:33.350
I'm sorry.

23:00.244 --> 23:02.646
Thanks. The family
           will appreciate this.

23:03.748 --> 23:04.915
(chuckles)
All right.

23:04.982 --> 23:06.716
(gentle laugh)

23:13.524 --> 23:15.192
Feels good...

23:15.259 --> 23:16.660
doesn't it, boss?

23:33.110 --> 23:36.413
(theme song playing)

23:57.835 --> 23:59.368
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:59.436 --> 24:00.670
(man grumbling)

24:01.305 --> 24:07.492
