<i>Can I get you
to sign right here, please?</i>

00:30.263 --> 00:32.128
<i>Okay. Here you go.</i>

00:32.198 --> 00:34.325
<i>- Thanks.
- You're welcome.</i>

00:38.838 --> 00:40.465

<i>I don't think anyone ever imagines
on their wedding day</i>

00:57.590 --> 01:01.549
<i>they'll be part of the 46%
that doesn't live happily ever after.</i>

01:02.996 --> 01:04.122
Will?

01:04.730 --> 01:07.029
Just heard we got the Quaker Oats account.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.898
Way to go.
You must be completely psyched.

01:10.537 --> 01:11.765
<i>Then again,</i>

01:11.838 --> 01:13.396
<i>I never thought I'd spend my days,</i>

01:13.473 --> 01:15.873
<i>weeks and years working
in an advertising agency</i>

01:15.942 --> 01:20.845
<i>trying to figure out how to get kids to eat
Cap'n Crunch instead of Froot Loops.</i>

01:21.648 --> 01:24.640
<i>But Tuesdays and Fridays
are my favorite days.</i>

01:24.717 --> 01:29.017
<i>I get out of work early, and I go pick up
my daughter, Maya, from school.</i>

01:29.089 --> 01:32.422
<i>Now, it's a great feeling when you find
the right track to go with the day.</i>

01:32.492 --> 01:36.428
<i>And today, I have found
the absolute perfect song.</i>

01:37.597 --> 01:39.565
<i>Bitches, they can kiss my...</i>

01:40.266 --> 01:42.359
<i>The other perfect song.</i>

02:29.983 --> 02:31.541
Thank you.

02:32.418 --> 02:34.113
You're welcome.

03:57.103 --> 04:00.971
<i>But sometimes, no matter
how carefully you plan your playlist,</i>

04:01.040 --> 04:04.009
<i>there is no right track for what awaits you.</i>

04:10.750 --> 04:13.810
- Come on, come on!
- Hey, what's going on?

04:13.886 --> 04:16.353
Will, did you know there was gonna be
a sex ed class today?

04:16.422 --> 04:17.514
Aren't they kind of young?

04:17.589 --> 04:20.718
- Yeah! It was a total disaster.
- At least it got them reading.

04:20.793 --> 04:21.987
There's a book!

04:22.060 --> 04:25.428
<i>"The 250 million sperm are ejaculated</i>

04:25.498 --> 04:29.229
<i>"and begin their treacherous journey
towards the fallopian tubes!</i>

04:29.302 --> 04:30.894
<i>"One hundred million are wiped
out instantly..."</i>

04:30.970 --> 04:32.437
I'm gonna find Maya.

04:32.505 --> 04:33.938
Do you still have sex with Daddy?

04:34.007 --> 04:35.201
- What are you talking about?
- Do you?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.936
- You know, we will go home and talk...
- You do, don't you?

04:37.010 --> 04:39.274
- We will go home and talk about this.
- I hate you, I hate you!

04:41.914 --> 04:45.543
Stop pulling on me! I am trying
to get to the bottom of something!

04:45.752 --> 04:47.151
We need to talk.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.151
Which is when the man
removes his penis from his pajamas

04:51.224 --> 04:52.486
and thrusts it into a woman's vagina...

04:52.558 --> 04:56.153
Okay, but Mrs. Gallagher
didn't actually say "thrust."

04:56.596 --> 04:57.756
- Yeah.
- Oh.

04:58.498 --> 04:59.726
But what I don't understand,

04:59.799 --> 05:02.666
Sammy Boigon's sister said
he was an accident.

05:02.735 --> 05:06.671
I mean, how do you accidentally
thrust a penis into... Hi, Luis.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.536
- Hey.
- How do you accidentally...

05:08.608 --> 05:13.011
<i>Stop saying "penis" and "thrust."
Just say "tinkle part" or "wee-wee."</i>

05:13.079 --> 05:14.103
Something cute.

05:14.180 --> 05:17.672
- Explain how Sammy was an accident.
- That's complicated.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.818
- Penis! Penis.
- Okay. All right, that's enough.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.617
Okay, they...

05:23.690 --> 05:27.091
It's not like his dad slipped
on a banana peel.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.494
The accident was that Sammy's mom
got pregnant.

05:32.632 --> 05:36.159
If they didn't want a baby,
then how come they had sex?

05:37.470 --> 05:39.665
That's a very good question.

05:40.106 --> 05:43.269
I guess you could say
that they were rehearsing.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.805
- Was I an accident?
- No.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.938
- I was, wasn't I?
- No.

05:49.015 --> 05:54.009
You were completely and totally on purpose.
I knew exactly what I was getting into.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.050
I think you should tell me
the story of you and my mom.

06:00.126 --> 06:03.755
<i>Why do you keep saying "my mom"
like I've never met her?</i>

06:04.130 --> 06:08.191
Well, because now that
you're getting divorced,

06:09.068 --> 06:11.332
she's mine, not yours.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.531
- Is that so?
- Tell me how it happened.

06:13.606 --> 06:18.703
<i>And the real story, not the,
"Oh, we met, we fell in love,</i>

06:18.778 --> 06:21.372
<i>"and we decided to take all that love</i>

06:21.447 --> 06:24.848
<i>"and make a family,
and that's how we made you."</i>

06:24.917 --> 06:27.112
You know something?
I'm gonna tell you the real, true story

06:27.186 --> 06:28.346
of how me and your mother met.

06:28.421 --> 06:30.048
- When I'm old enough.
- Yep.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.422
- Look. I know love isn't a fairytale.
- Really?

06:33.493 --> 06:34.892
Really.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.121
Did you have another girlfriend
before you met her?

06:39.332 --> 06:40.765
Come on, tell me the truth.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.227
I had two serious girlfriends.

06:44.303 --> 06:47.761
And then some other,
a smattering of other women that I dated.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.137
You know.

06:49.742 --> 06:50.834
What?

06:50.910 --> 06:53.208
What's the boy word for slut?

06:53.613 --> 06:57.071
They still haven't come up with one yet,
but I'm sure they're working on it.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.549
You a vegetarian this week or not?

06:58.618 --> 07:00.085
- Yeah, I am.
- Great.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.553
I'm guessing
you weren't her first boyfriend.

07:02.622 --> 07:05.955
Maybe it was some nerdy guy,
or maybe he was mean.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.526
Or maybe

07:09.829 --> 07:12.024
you were friends for the longest time,

07:12.098 --> 07:15.397
and then just when you were
about to put your penis

07:15.468 --> 07:16.594
into somebody else's vagina...

07:16.669 --> 07:17.693
Okay. Good night, Maya.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.203
...you realized Mom
was the only one for you!

07:19.272 --> 07:20.398
Bedtime!

07:20.473 --> 07:23.271
You still have to tell me
the story of why you fell in love with her.

07:23.342 --> 07:26.709
I fell in love with her because
she was smart and beautiful and fun.

07:26.779 --> 07:30.010
So now she's stupid and ugly and boring?

07:30.082 --> 07:32.380
- Of course not.
- Then what's the problem?

07:32.452 --> 07:36.650
- It's complicated, Maya.
- Everything with you is so complicated.

07:36.722 --> 07:41.659
I bet that if you just told me the story,
you'd realize that it's not complicated at all.

07:41.828 --> 07:44.160
That you just love her.

07:44.997 --> 07:47.397
I know this is tough for you,
but what are you thinking?

07:47.467 --> 07:50.231
That I'm gonna tell you this story
and it's gonna make everything better?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.327
It doesn't work that way.

07:51.404 --> 07:55.363
Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
Tell me and we'll find out.

07:56.242 --> 07:59.678
No. Game over. It's time for bed.

07:59.745 --> 08:03.681
No, it's not time for bed!
It's time for you to tell me the story!

08:03.749 --> 08:05.979
- Maya.
- I need to know!

08:08.287 --> 08:09.845
I need to know.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.652
Fine! Fine!

08:14.060 --> 08:15.118
I'm gonna tell you the story,

08:15.194 --> 08:16.627
- but I'm not telling you who your mom is.
- Fine.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.061
You're just gonna have
to figure it out for yourself.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.461
- Good.
- And I'm changing all the names

08:19.532 --> 08:21.898
and some of the facts,
but I just decided that right now.

08:21.968 --> 08:25.233
- And then we'll see how smart you are.
- I like it. It's like a love story/mystery.

08:25.304 --> 08:27.670
- Great. Sounds good. You ready?
- No.

08:27.740 --> 08:28.798
No.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.308
- Take your time.
- I will.

08:33.379 --> 08:35.539
- I know you will.
- You go here.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.606
- Princess pillow?
- Thank you.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.344
- You bet.
- Okay.

08:47.226 --> 08:48.784
I'm ready.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.658
Once upon a time,

08:51.264 --> 08:55.724
before e-mails and cell phones
and reality television shows,

08:56.636 --> 09:01.403
<i>in 1992 to be exact,
in a little town called Madison, Wisconsin,</i>

09:01.474 --> 09:04.034
<i>there lived a young man
named William Hayes.</i>

09:04.110 --> 09:07.705
- Hey, Will, man, Happy New Year.
- Hey, yeah, you, too.

09:07.780 --> 09:13.013
<i>Now, this young man was deeply,
deeply in love with his college sweetheart.</i>

09:13.085 --> 09:14.313
<i>Let's call her...</i>

09:14.387 --> 09:16.014
- Emily!
- Emily!

09:16.455 --> 09:17.683
Emily!

09:18.925 --> 09:20.187
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:20.259 --> 09:23.285
Ten, nine, eight...

09:23.362 --> 09:28.459
Hey, guess who's gonna be the luckiest guy
on planet Earth in about four seconds?

09:28.534 --> 09:29.831
You.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.597
two, one!

09:31.671 --> 09:33.605
Happy New Year!

09:33.673 --> 09:35.607
<i>They were a perfect couple.</i>

09:35.675 --> 09:38.610
<i>Except to really understand
how this young man</i>

09:38.678 --> 09:40.839
<i>ended up marrying your mother,
you'll also need to know</i>

09:40.913 --> 09:45.577
<i>that he had a very big,
incredibly embarrassing dream.</i>

09:45.651 --> 09:47.084
All rise

09:48.788 --> 09:52.952
for the President
of the United States of America,

09:54.026 --> 09:55.550
William

09:55.928 --> 09:57.259
Matthew

09:58.264 --> 09:59.754
Hayes.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.901
<i>You wanted to be President?</i>

10:06.339 --> 10:09.365
I'm just, I don't understand why you have
to work for Clinton in New York.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.307
Why can't you just work for him in Madison?

10:11.377 --> 10:13.436
Well, because they don't need me here.
They need me in New York.

10:13.512 --> 10:17.812
They need him, Em. Will's the man.
I can't believe you're letting him go.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.783
I mean, don't you know
about New York girls?

10:19.852 --> 10:22.218
Besides being incredibly hot,
they have no problem with casual sex,

10:22.288 --> 10:24.381
which by the way, I totally respect.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.721
- What if Charlie's right?
- Charlie's never right.

10:26.792 --> 10:30.751
- He's functionally retarded.
- I am worried New York's gonna change you.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.855
- Change can be good.
- If we change together.

10:32.932 --> 10:35.628
So, we'll change together.

10:35.701 --> 10:38.727
Okay? It's two months in New York.
I'll be back before you know it.

10:38.804 --> 10:39.998
Besides, we have a plan, right?

10:40.072 --> 10:43.508
The other thing I can't believe is that
you'd risk leaving Emily here with me,

10:43.576 --> 10:47.603
'cause I gotta tell you,
I've always had a thing for you...

10:48.280 --> 10:50.748
And I have absolutely no scruples.

10:53.219 --> 10:56.780
Wait! I almost forgot.
You have to give this to Summer.

10:57.123 --> 10:58.147
She's the only girl I know in New York.

10:58.224 --> 10:59.316
- I want you to meet her.
- Summer Hartley?

10:59.392 --> 11:00.654
- Yes. Yes.
- That's her name?

11:00.726 --> 11:02.455
She was on my exchange program
at Cambridge,

11:02.528 --> 11:05.827
and all the guys wanted to sleep with her,
and you probably will, too.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.058
Maybe you should mail it to her.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.293
- That might be a better idea.
- No.

11:08.367 --> 11:09.356
What is it?

11:09.435 --> 11:12.768
Something I should have
sent her a long time ago.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.330
I love you, William Hayes.

11:17.376 --> 11:20.971
Okay. Go, go, go. Go be your brilliant self.

11:22.214 --> 11:24.648
<i>Emily sounds like she would
make a good mom.</i>

11:24.717 --> 11:27.515
<i>- I just don't know if she's my mom.
- Why not?</i>

11:27.586 --> 11:28.883
<i>Everyone knows that the girlfriend</i>

11:28.954 --> 11:31.855
<i>in the beginning of the story
always gets dumped.</i>

11:31.924 --> 11:35.189
<i>Which means maybe
Summer Hartley is my mother.</i>

11:52.044 --> 11:53.739
<i>I'll never forget that day.</i>

11:53.813 --> 11:57.613
<i>There I was, arriving in the city
I always dreamed about</i>

11:57.683 --> 12:00.811
<i>to work on a campaign
that I believed in with all of my heart.</i>

12:00.886 --> 12:04.378
<i>And on top of that,
I was positive that in just a few hours,</i>

12:04.457 --> 12:07.426
<i>the campaign manager would realize
how brilliant I was.</i>

12:07.493 --> 12:08.983
<i>And then I'd be writing speeches,</i>

12:09.061 --> 12:11.188
<i>and then I'd be coming up with strategy,
and before long...</i>

12:11.263 --> 12:12.628
Will Hayes?

12:12.698 --> 12:14.393
- Hey. Gareth Henderson.
- You're Gareth.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.095
- Hey, how are you?
- Nice to meet you. We're walking, Hayes.

12:17.169 --> 12:21.435
I brought my C.V. and a sample of some
speeches I wrote for Congressman Sweeney.

12:21.507 --> 12:25.466
Fantastic. I cannot wait to peruse these
in my abundant spare time.

12:25.544 --> 12:28.638
In the meantime, here's a sample
of the coffee and bagel order

12:28.714 --> 12:30.477
I'll need filled immediately.

12:30.549 --> 12:31.709
Wait!

12:32.184 --> 12:33.481
You want me to get coffee?

12:33.552 --> 12:36.612
At some point in our lives, we all get coffee.
Your time's now. Come on.

12:36.689 --> 12:37.747
We're still walking, Hayes.

12:37.823 --> 12:40.485
Have the coffee here by 10:00,
or Arthur's gonna kill me!

12:40.559 --> 12:43.528
That means I'm gonna have to kill you.
I've killed before, Hayes.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.588
- You should know that.
- What is this?

12:46.665 --> 12:48.257
That is a cellular telephone

12:48.334 --> 12:51.633
so I can get a hold of you wherever,
whenever, for whatever.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.730
- Can somebody get me an aspirin, please?
- Watch it!

12:54.807 --> 12:56.968
Glad to have you aboard, Hayes!

13:00.279 --> 13:02.304
- Hi.
- What? Hi.

13:02.381 --> 13:05.282
Four weeks from now,
voters of New York State

13:05.351 --> 13:09.014
will select their next Democratic nominee
for President.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.348
Now, if Bill Clinton wins,

13:11.891 --> 13:14.826
I want you to all understand
that it's gonna be as a direct result

13:14.894 --> 13:18.853
of the commitment and the energy
of every person in this room.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.333
And I mean that. That's just a fact.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.494
Now, that's how important the work is.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.504
That each and every one of you is...

13:30.309 --> 13:32.800
What am I doing here?

13:33.212 --> 13:34.873
It's the new guy.

13:37.049 --> 13:39.847
- Hey.
- Hey, is that the toilet paper guy?

13:43.289 --> 13:47.521
- Can I get a pack of Morley Red, please?
- 3.25.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.786
3.25? These are $2.15
in Madison, Wisconsin.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.229
So go back to Madison.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.859
- Don't forget to write.
- That's right. Don't forget to write.

13:55.935 --> 13:58.233
<i>Hold it! Stop. Stop right there!</i>

13:58.604 --> 14:00.003
You smoked?

14:00.072 --> 14:01.539
No. Yeah.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.477
But I didn't mean to tell you that.

14:06.812 --> 14:11.306
Listen. I was young, and I was stupid,
and I haven't smoked in years.

14:11.383 --> 14:12.509
I promise you.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.782
Is there anything else you should tell me?

14:16.355 --> 14:18.255
Probably not.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.698
- Can I get 10 copies?
- Put them on the pile.

14:26.765 --> 14:29.233
No, they're for Arthur.
I need them like, 15 minutes ago.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.428
So if you wouldn't mind...

14:31.804 --> 14:33.328
You're the toilet paper guy.

14:33.405 --> 14:36.863
<i>Wait. Who's that?
- That's April.</i>

14:37.676 --> 14:40.702
Yes. I am, in fact, the toilet paper guy,

14:40.779 --> 14:42.770
but feel free to call me
the bagel-and-coffee guy.

14:42.848 --> 14:47.683
Or Todd in Accounting calls me Crystal,
which I'm pretty sure is a girl's name.

14:47.753 --> 14:50.779
- How many copies?
- Ten. Please.

14:50.856 --> 14:53.188
- These?
- Yeah, both of those.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.451
What made you become
a Bill Clinton supporter?

14:56.528 --> 14:59.156
I'm not. This is a money gig.
I get paid 12 an hour,

14:59.231 --> 15:03.531
which is better than babysitting, which is
what I've been doing way too much of.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.069
You're a Democrat, right?

15:05.137 --> 15:08.538
Why does everyone have to be
a Democrat or a Republican?

15:08.607 --> 15:09.869
I'm struggling with the copy machine.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.206
No, hold on.
You're an Independent, aren't you?

15:12.278 --> 15:15.611
I am nothing.
Why am I obligated to be something?

15:15.681 --> 15:18.912
Why do I have to have an opinion
about everything anyway?

15:18.984 --> 15:21.009
I mean, really,
what do I know about missile systems

15:21.086 --> 15:23.316
or Social Security, or the tax code?

15:23.389 --> 15:26.552
What about civil rights or women's rights?

15:26.625 --> 15:28.923
A woman's right to do what she wants
with her body? What about that?

15:28.994 --> 15:31.485
I do what I want with my body.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.929
That's apathetic.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.694
- I'm not apathetic.
- Yes, you are.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.135
I'm not. I just know that these bozos
you're working for,

15:39.204 --> 15:41.263
they don't care about anything more
than their own ambitions.

15:41.340 --> 15:42.500
That's absolutely not true.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.940
You think this guy, Bill Clinton,
is gonna make a huge difference?

15:45.010 --> 15:47.001
- I do.
- He's gonna do what's already inevitable.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.172
- Okay, that's where you're wrong.
- Don't make me staple your head!

15:49.248 --> 15:51.682
You're wrong. He's gonna make
a difference with African Americans.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.513
He's gonna make a difference with women.
He gets women.

15:53.585 --> 15:55.246
- My God.
- I mean, look at his record in Arkansas.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.083
Read his plans on health care.
Read his plans on education.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.749
- Okay, or don't. You know, yeah.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

15:59.825 --> 16:00.849
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- I just fell asleep.

16:00.926 --> 16:02.325
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah. That's fine.

16:02.394 --> 16:03.622
Wake up to a new America.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.459
- I believe you.
- This has been really interesting.

16:05.531 --> 16:08.796
- Fine. You convinced me. You're nothing.
- I'm nothing.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.698
<i>So I'm here to repeat in front of all of you...</i>

16:10.769 --> 16:13.670
Hey! Listen up! Look up, everybody!

16:14.306 --> 16:17.173
<i>Yes, I was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years.</i>

16:17.242 --> 16:18.231
Hey, somebody turn it up.

16:18.310 --> 16:22.406
<i>For the past two years, I have lied to the
press about our relationship to protect him.</i>

16:22.481 --> 16:24.779
<i>The truth is, I loved him.</i>

16:26.685 --> 16:28.778
<i>Now he tells me to deny it.</i>

16:28.854 --> 16:34.884
<i>Well, I'm sick of all of the deceit,
and I'm sick of all of the lies.</i>

16:35.327 --> 16:39.923
Well, you're right about one thing.
He certainly gets women.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.127
- This has been fun. Yeah.
- Bye, toilet paper guy.

16:43.202 --> 16:44.794
Bye, copy girl.

16:45.604 --> 16:47.128
Oh, my God. It never ends.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.106
They just keep playing it
over and over and over again.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.505
It's gonna blow over.
- Right.

16:50.576 --> 16:51.634
People don't really care about this stuff.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.803
- That's the thing.
- What I don't understand,

16:53.879 --> 16:56.177
I've heard Bush has a mistress.

16:56.248 --> 16:59.547
Everybody's talking about it, so why
is it okay for him and not for Clinton?

16:59.618 --> 17:00.915
She's trashy.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.646
I mean, her hair alone
is enough reason to go after Clinton.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.953
Big deal. Everyone has their weaknesses,
you know?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.994
Those chubby redheads
with the long, fake fingernails?

17:10.061 --> 17:12.530
- That's what Daddy likes.
- That's just nasty.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.759
Gareth, you are unfailingly repugnant.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.769
Hey. That is a coincidence. I love women
that say "unfailingly repugnant."

17:18.837 --> 17:19.997
You know what I love?

17:20.071 --> 17:22.301
I love long-haired brunettes
with horn-rimmed glasses.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.535
I have no idea why.
They're like kryptonite to me.

17:24.609 --> 17:25.941
I got that one, too.

17:26.011 --> 17:29.276
I got a thing for guys
who've got a thing for me.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.449
You might wanna look at that.
I'm gonna propose a toast.

17:32.518 --> 17:34.076
I am fine with that.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.314
- To Bill and his weaknesses.
- Yes.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.650
- To Bill.
- To Bill.

17:44.897 --> 17:45.921
<i>Hello?</i>

17:45.998 --> 17:47.727
Hey! It's me!

17:47.800 --> 17:49.461
- Is that Emily?
- Is that Emily?

17:49.535 --> 17:51.526
- Hi, Emily!
- Hi, Emily!

17:51.603 --> 17:52.763
<i>What's all that noise?</i>

17:52.838 --> 17:56.467
Nothing. That's just a couple of idiots
I work with making fun of me

17:56.542 --> 18:01.104
because they don't have a beautiful
girlfriend that they're eternally devoted to!

18:01.180 --> 18:02.238
<i>You're drunk.</i>

18:02.314 --> 18:03.713
You're beautiful.

18:03.782 --> 18:06.580
<i>- You're horny.
- You might be right.</i>

18:07.820 --> 18:10.448
Emily? Come to New York.

18:10.522 --> 18:13.320
You'll love it here.
It's the energy, the people. It's amazing.

18:13.392 --> 18:17.522
<i>Whoa, did you just say "energy"?
Will, you did not just say "energy."</i>

18:17.596 --> 18:18.824
What?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.930
You're never coming back.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.902
Hey, come on, now.
I just want you to come for a weekend.

18:27.072 --> 18:29.063
You're right. I'm sorry.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.306
Did you call Summer?

18:32.811 --> 18:36.440
No. I left her a message.
She didn't get back to me.

18:38.717 --> 18:41.413
Hey. You okay?

18:41.487 --> 18:43.387
<i>Yeah. I'm just really lonely here,</i>

18:43.455 --> 18:46.652
and I miss you like crazy,
and it's really hard.

18:48.193 --> 18:50.354
Yeah. I know what you mean.

19:12.151 --> 19:16.485
- Hey. What are you doing up?
- Mr. McCormack.

19:16.555 --> 19:20.753
Come on, you've been staring
at that package for about a week now.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.927
How was the rest of your evening?
Successful, I take it.

19:24.997 --> 19:29.991
Oh, my goodness. I'm in big trouble.
I love this girl!

19:30.669 --> 19:32.159
You know, that's usually a good thing.

19:32.237 --> 19:35.035
It's hard enough to get elected
the first black President

19:35.107 --> 19:37.940
without having Julia Roberts
on your arm at the inauguration.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.945
That is an impressive mental leap, Russ,

19:41.013 --> 19:44.779
going from a one-night stand
to being sworn in as President.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.383
Open it.

19:47.452 --> 19:50.546
I know you're dying to know what's inside.

19:50.622 --> 19:54.422
Just her name alone, Summer Hartley,
is driving me...

19:54.493 --> 19:57.189
Look it! You got a tear right there! I see it.

19:57.262 --> 20:00.129
Come on through. You can do it.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.030
Thank you. Yes.

20:07.005 --> 20:09.405
- It's a diary.
- Sweet Jesus. Let me see.

20:09.474 --> 20:13.672
No! Stop! Stop right there.
We're not gonna read this. We can't.

20:14.446 --> 20:18.780
"The boys' dorm is across
the quad, their windows visible from ours.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.943
<i>"The evenings are hot and sticky.</i>

20:22.020 --> 20:26.423
<i>"We are all half-dressed,
pretending we can't be seen by the boys.</i>

20:26.491 --> 20:29.426
<i>"Some of us are bold. My new friend</i>

20:30.229 --> 20:32.220
<i>"Emily is sweet</i>

20:33.198 --> 20:37.328
<i>"and embarrassed by it all,
always waiting to see what I will do."</i>

20:38.070 --> 20:42.700
Don't stop! This is good stuff.
Where were you? Okay.

20:43.375 --> 20:47.311
<i>"It's our last night, and the plan has
been in place for days.</i>

20:47.379 --> 20:49.904
<i>"Emily and I are the last to leave,</i>

20:49.982 --> 20:54.681
<i>"and as we reach the stairs,
I grab Emily firmly by her wrist.</i>

20:54.753 --> 21:00.191
<i>"She looks up at me expectantly
and I know what will happen next."</i>

21:00.259 --> 21:02.284
- Do you?
- I think I have a pretty good idea.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.795
Oh, my goodness!

21:05.564 --> 21:08.556
What are you doing?
This is good stuff, man!

21:10.402 --> 21:11.994
Wait a minute.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.270
Is that your Emily?

21:15.741 --> 21:17.606
Good night, Russell!

21:18.277 --> 21:20.211
She is a freak!

21:20.279 --> 21:22.611
Put the picture back!

21:36.461 --> 21:37.792
Wow.

21:42.834 --> 21:46.463
Who is it?
- Will Hayes. I called earlier.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.039
You a Jehovah's Witness?

21:50.108 --> 21:51.370
No.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.308
Christ, you're tall.

21:55.614 --> 21:56.876
Hi.

22:07.626 --> 22:09.526
- Come in.
- Okay.

22:09.594 --> 22:11.653
Close the door behind you.

22:12.731 --> 22:13.993
Lock it!

22:14.800 --> 22:19.134
Summer said to hang tight.
She'll be back. She wants you to wait.

22:19.204 --> 22:24.141
- What do you got in there?
- I don't know. Are you Summer's father?

22:24.810 --> 22:26.778
Yeah. I'm her daddy.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.452
- Drink?
- No. No. It's a little early for me.

22:44.529 --> 22:47.054
Early. You're fresh off the boat, aren't you?

22:47.132 --> 22:51.933
So tell me about yourself. What's your deal?
What do you aspire to?

22:52.003 --> 22:55.234
What are your dreams?
What are your fancies?

22:55.307 --> 22:57.969
What do you want to be when you grow up?

22:58.043 --> 22:59.271
- Sit down!
- Okay.

22:59.344 --> 23:00.743
What do you do now? You...

23:00.812 --> 23:02.302
Wait, don't tell me.
You work for your daddy.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.507
- No.
- No, don't tell me!

23:03.582 --> 23:04.708
Wall Street. No!

23:04.783 --> 23:07.877
You kiss ass to some fancy uptown law firm.

23:07.953 --> 23:10.945
- Actually...
- No! I give up. What do you do?

23:11.022 --> 23:14.583
I'm working for Bill Clinton.
He's running for President.

23:14.659 --> 23:15.785
No.

23:16.628 --> 23:17.788
I know who Bill Clinton is.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.696
Yeah, in fact, I know more about Bill Clinton
than his own mother.

23:20.766 --> 23:21.824
- Really?
- Yep.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.528
- What do you do?
- What do I do?

23:24.603 --> 23:25.934
I drink!

23:26.371 --> 23:27.599
Drink!

23:28.507 --> 23:29.974
Be a man.

23:32.677 --> 23:35.009
There you go! Isn't that better?

23:36.014 --> 23:37.345
Swallow!

23:39.217 --> 23:41.082
So tell me about Bill Clinton.

23:44.723 --> 23:46.714
Hey. Wake up.

23:57.235 --> 23:58.998
You want some aspirin?

24:05.577 --> 24:07.943
- You must be Will.
- Hi.

24:08.547 --> 24:11.539
I see you drank my boyfriend
under the table.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.745
He's not your father?
- Is that what he told you?

24:15.887 --> 24:16.876
Hmm.

24:17.055 --> 24:18.989
He's my thesis advisor.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.079
Oh.

24:20.659 --> 24:21.819
What else did he tell you?

24:21.893 --> 24:25.260
He was telling me how to be a real man,
as opposed to the sort of

24:25.330 --> 24:28.697
- boy-man I seem to be.
- Did you learn anything?

24:29.434 --> 24:31.698
Yeah, there's a lot of drinking involved.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.034
Also cursing and fighting.

24:34.105 --> 24:35.470
- Sex?
- Yes.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.371
Although that's not what we real men call it.

24:37.442 --> 24:39.342
What do you call it?

24:40.612 --> 24:44.776
I have something for you.
This is from Emily.

24:45.750 --> 24:49.584
- Haven't talked to her in ages.
- We'll be moving in together in the fall.

24:49.654 --> 24:50.848
Uh-huh.

24:52.123 --> 24:54.284
Oh, please! Daddy.

24:58.930 --> 25:00.693
Oh, come on! No.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.258
Oh, this is...

25:12.944 --> 25:14.673
Did you read this?

25:15.313 --> 25:16.575
I didn't.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.551
- I read a page.
- A page.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.282
- Two pages at the most.
- Two?

25:24.356 --> 25:27.382
And the part about you and Emily
touching each other and kissing.

25:27.526 --> 25:32.691
- Oh! That part, yeah.
- Incredibly descriptive. I felt like I was there.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.433
You're a great writer. I mean...

25:35.500 --> 25:38.435
I think you should keep it.
You should read it when you're lonely.

25:38.503 --> 25:42.701
- I can't. It's your diary, so I can't do that.
- No, really, really. I just, I don't need it.

25:42.774 --> 25:44.867
I've already got it memorized,
so I'll just leave it on the table.

25:44.943 --> 25:47.241
Keep a hard copy.
That might be nice for me.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.544
I wonder why Emily gave it to you
to give to me.

25:52.617 --> 25:53.709
Hmm.

25:55.787 --> 25:57.084
Hampton?

25:57.756 --> 26:00.224
- Hampton?
- Are you gonna join us?

26:00.292 --> 26:02.658
That's Hampton Roth.
He's an incredible writer.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.821
- His book on the McGovern campaign is...
- Yeah.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.966
- You...
- Yeah. We do.

26:10.001 --> 26:13.198
Look, have you ever actually
had sex with a sexagenarian?

26:13.271 --> 26:16.263
- I haven't.
- Well, then you shouldn't really judge.

26:16.341 --> 26:19.333
Well, actually, I'm not judging. Look at you.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.710
You're beautiful. You're sophisticated.
You're a very talented writer.

26:22.781 --> 26:23.805
Thank you.

26:23.882 --> 26:26.214
I mean, to please a woman like you,
it would obviously take a...

26:26.284 --> 26:28.013
- Real man.
- Exactly.

26:28.086 --> 26:32.284
- Hard to compete with that.
- Well, unless you're the competitive type.

26:34.059 --> 26:37.995
- Yep, nice to meet you.
- Yeah, it was great meeting you, too.

26:38.363 --> 26:41.025
I feel horrible about taking the...

26:53.712 --> 26:54.872
Sorry.

26:56.047 --> 26:57.912
I was just curious.

26:58.650 --> 27:01.949
Hampton encourages me
to cultivate my curiosity.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.946
He says it's the key
to being a good journalist.

27:06.524 --> 27:07.684
Yeah.

27:07.926 --> 27:10.952
Summer! Daddy's hungry!

27:12.130 --> 27:14.621
- Speak of the devil. Better go. Yeah.
- Hmm.

27:14.699 --> 27:15.757
Where the hell are you?

27:15.834 --> 27:17.495
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

27:17.869 --> 27:21.327
Yeah, give us a call sometime.
We should all go out for dinner.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.169
I'd... Yeah, I'd love dinner.

27:23.241 --> 27:24.674
- Yeah.
- Hey!

27:27.112 --> 27:29.637
- Are you gonna call her?
- Are you insane?

27:29.714 --> 27:31.944
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- What am I gonna do?

27:33.118 --> 27:37.612
I'm gonna keep my eye on the ball.
Emily and I have a future. We have a plan.

27:37.689 --> 27:39.589
Which may involve
some type of threesome now.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.320
Or foursome
if that old dude is still in the picture.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.225
You're not helping.

27:45.096 --> 27:49.692
I never should have opened that diary.
It's like Pandora's hot, sexy box.

27:50.602 --> 27:51.933
<i>What's a threesome?</i>

27:52.003 --> 27:53.834
- What?
- A threesome.

27:56.241 --> 28:00.268
That's a game that adults play sometimes
when they're bored.

28:03.148 --> 28:06.015
Whatever. So what happened with Emily?

28:06.084 --> 28:08.609
Nothing. I wanted to wait
till she came for a visit,

28:08.687 --> 28:11.520
and then I decided to do
something really dramatic.

28:12.757 --> 28:15.851
<i>It was just one week
before the primary, and I had graduated</i>

28:15.927 --> 28:20.387
<i>from bagels and toilet paper
to signs and bumper stickers.</i>

28:23.201 --> 28:25.192
Jesus! Mercy!

28:25.270 --> 28:26.794
Hold, please.

28:27.639 --> 28:29.630
What am I doing here?

28:33.411 --> 28:37.973
Move over! Another foot!
Go, another foot. Move over!

28:38.049 --> 28:40.210
Over, over, over!

28:45.123 --> 28:48.354
Just want to let everyone know
that the new signs are ready.

28:48.426 --> 28:50.155
They're looking good.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.253
I wrote three speeches
for Congressman Sweeney.

28:53.631 --> 28:54.893
How's high school?

28:54.966 --> 28:58.902
<i>He's from Texas. His name's George Bush.
But he is not the President.</i>

28:58.970 --> 29:01.029
<i>Instead, he's the eldest son
of George and Barbara</i>

29:01.106 --> 29:03.472
<i>and considered a key
political advisor of the White House.</i>

29:03.541 --> 29:05.475
<i>Bryant, well, you forgot to mention
the Texas Rangers.</i>

29:05.543 --> 29:06.567
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

29:06.644 --> 29:08.544
Man, if this guy's smart,
he'll go back to baseball.

29:08.613 --> 29:09.978
- No kidding.
- Anybody see Hayes?

29:10.048 --> 29:11.106
- No.
- No.

29:11.549 --> 29:15.076
Hayes! Where is Hayes? Hayes!

29:15.620 --> 29:18.521
Is it true you graduated first
of your class at Madison?

29:18.590 --> 29:20.319
- Yeah.
- All right.

29:20.391 --> 29:22.222
- Come on. We're walking.
- We're walking.

29:22.293 --> 29:24.352
Here's a list of Madison graduates
in the New York area.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.260
These people earn 200 grand plus a year.

29:26.331 --> 29:29.789
We have a $10,000-a-plate fundraiser
on Monday with 15 empty tables.

29:29.868 --> 29:32.336
I can't have that, Hayes.
I need you to sell five of them.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.098
Hold on. No more coffee, bagels?

29:34.172 --> 29:35.901
- We'll see how this goes, okay?
- Gareth.

29:35.974 --> 29:39.671
- What?
- Thank you. I'm really happy right now.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.609
- Okay, Hayes.
- Okay.

29:41.679 --> 29:45.740
- There's the desk.
- Look at that. Yeah.

29:46.918 --> 29:49.113
Yeah, that's funny, the toilet paper.

29:49.187 --> 29:51.678
That's good because it's ironic.

29:51.756 --> 29:54.657
Yeah, that's right, everybody. My desk.

29:55.326 --> 29:57.624
Right here, I got a desk, and I got a list.

29:57.695 --> 30:00.926
And I have a phone. And this empty basket.

30:00.999 --> 30:02.364
No, no, no, I really don't agree

30:02.433 --> 30:05.960
that the Governor has a character problem,
Mrs. Perleman.

30:06.037 --> 30:08.335
Did you know that
50% of Americans believe that

30:08.406 --> 30:10.067
marijuana use should be legalized?

30:11.242 --> 30:12.266
Hello?

30:12.343 --> 30:15.278
No, no, no, he wasn't a draft dodger.

30:15.413 --> 30:18.348
Besides, did you know that
the majority of Americans believe

30:18.416 --> 30:21.510
that the Vietnam War
was just a terrible idea?

30:22.053 --> 30:23.452
Both legs.

30:23.588 --> 30:26.352
Wow, I am sorry. You must miss them.

30:28.359 --> 30:33.763
Yes, I understand your concern,
but I think you should remember

30:35.934 --> 30:38.801
that the Governor comes from
a town called Hope.

30:39.637 --> 30:42.970
And hope is exactly what he stands for, so...

30:43.141 --> 30:46.702
No, no, I know it's corny, but I also think

30:46.778 --> 30:50.714
that sometimes corny is exactly
what this country needs.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.581
That would be wonderful. No, thank you.

30:55.653 --> 30:57.018
Two seats.

30:57.655 --> 30:59.316
Okay, great. Thank you, Mr. Bishop.

31:01.059 --> 31:03.687
Yeah, the dinner's next Thursday.

31:04.762 --> 31:06.525
Yes, when I spoke with Hillary this morning

31:06.598 --> 31:11.297
she said that she wanted to get to know
our most important supporters.

31:11.803 --> 31:14.067
No, I think you'd definitely
enjoy meeting her.

31:14.138 --> 31:15.332
Yeah.

31:17.242 --> 31:20.302
An entire table? No, that is very possible.

31:20.378 --> 31:24.474
I'll put you down for one table, then.
That sounds great.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.676
Okay, I look forward
to seeing you next Thursday.

31:26.751 --> 31:28.480
Okay, thank you.

31:31.723 --> 31:35.784
I just sold an entire table for $50,000.

31:41.666 --> 31:44.100
That's my guy, Will. My guy.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.609
Toilet paper guy! Toilet paper guy!

31:52.477 --> 31:55.378
Good evening, gentlemen.
Pack of Reds, please.

31:55.446 --> 31:58.313
3.60. New tax and a new warning.

31:59.284 --> 32:00.410
Christ.

32:01.185 --> 32:03.585
Tell us the truth, my friend.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.317
- Did that Clinton inhale or not?
- What does it matter?

32:06.391 --> 32:09.758
That's like if your girlfriend catches you
in bed with another woman, then you say,

32:09.827 --> 32:11.055
<i>"But we didn't do it."</i>

32:11.129 --> 32:14.360
- What, is that gonna matter to her?
- Yeah, it does. Hi.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.966
- Hello.
- Pack of American Eagles, blue, please.

32:18.036 --> 32:19.503
4.25.

32:19.570 --> 32:23.199
4.25? You pay $4.25
for a pack of cigarettes?

32:23.274 --> 32:25.208
They don't put as many chemicals in them.

32:25.276 --> 32:28.006
- So those are healthy cigarettes.
- Something like that.

32:28.079 --> 32:30.138
So if there's not as many chemicals in them,

32:30.214 --> 32:33.308
they should cost less, not more,
don't you think?

32:33.384 --> 32:36.080
They put saltpeter in your cigarettes,

32:36.154 --> 32:39.612
which make them burn faster,
which make you smoke more.

32:39.724 --> 32:45.253
Which means, at the end of the day,
your cigarettes actually cost more, not less.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.463
Copy girl,
what I think you're actually paying for

32:50.535 --> 32:53.595
is the picture of the eagle
and the pretty pastel colors.

32:53.671 --> 32:58.131
Some reassuring idea about your lifestyle.
The rest is pretty much crap.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.610
- You wanna bet?
- Sure.

33:00.678 --> 33:03.146
- 20 bucks.
- I got 20 bucks.

33:03.214 --> 33:04.613
Easiest 20 bucks I ever made.

33:04.682 --> 33:05.706
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:05.783 --> 33:07.478
That's funny.
In a minute, I'll have 40.

33:07.552 --> 33:10.817
Okay, we have to inhale at the same time
for the same amount of time.

33:10.888 --> 33:13.379
- Yep.
- Ready, steady, go.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.266
- It's my birthday today.
- Happy birthday.

33:35.546 --> 33:37.844
Why aren't you out celebrating?

33:38.483 --> 33:42.419
My boyfriend, Lucas, was taking me out
for dinner and then to a party.

33:42.487 --> 33:47.186
But at last minute, he gets a gig in Philly,
which, of course, he takes 'cause...

33:56.067 --> 33:57.796
Truth is he's far more interested in being

33:57.869 --> 34:00.861
the next Kurt Cobain
than being my boyfriend.

34:01.305 --> 34:03.000
Who's Kurt Cobain?

34:04.342 --> 34:06.037
You're kidding me!

34:07.278 --> 34:08.540
What?

34:09.380 --> 34:10.677
Smoke.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.208
Oh.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.788
- Look at that.
- Look at that.

34:25.463 --> 34:28.659
- All right.
- No, come on.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.223
The satisfaction of me being right

34:30.301 --> 34:33.429
and you being wrong
is more than enough for me.

34:33.504 --> 34:35.699
Well, I never welsh on a bet,
so I'll tell you what.

34:35.773 --> 34:38.571
I'll take you out for dinner,
for a birthday dinner.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.270
- What do you say?
- Like a date?

34:40.344 --> 34:42.107
No, I didn't mean it like that.

34:42.179 --> 34:43.579
<i>Like an "I feel sorry for you</i>

34:43.648 --> 34:46.139
<i>"because it's your birthday
and you have no plans" dinner.</i>

34:46.217 --> 34:48.879
- You know, one of those.
- Well, I'll tell you what.

34:48.953 --> 34:50.944
You can take me to this party
I have to go to,

34:51.022 --> 34:53.956
because there's no way
I can face going alone.

35:01.332 --> 35:03.766
Yeah, I'm gonna go head over...

35:05.503 --> 35:06.663
Whoa.

35:08.539 --> 35:10.837
I think I'm a little out of my league here.

35:10.908 --> 35:12.739
Yes, you are.

35:17.315 --> 35:20.512
So Emily is what, like,
your college sweetheart?

35:20.585 --> 35:22.553
- It's amazing how you do that.
- What?

35:22.620 --> 35:24.212
The way you take the simplest statement,

35:24.288 --> 35:27.519
and then you twist it with
a completely negative connotation.

35:27.592 --> 35:30.584
- It's really, actually, impressive. I'm amazed.
- I didn't mean to do that.

35:30.661 --> 35:33.095
- But I understand. I get it.
- I actually think it's very sweet.

35:33.164 --> 35:34.563
- See, you did it again.
- Really?

35:34.632 --> 35:36.065
- Yeah.
- I don't even know I'm doing it.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.297
It's probably hard for you to imagine
a relationship based on mutual respect

35:39.370 --> 35:43.204
without even the slightest hint of
whatever you call it, masochism.

35:43.274 --> 35:46.368
Well, if your deal with Emily
is so gosh darn wonderful,

35:46.444 --> 35:48.241
then why don't you just marry her?

35:48.312 --> 35:50.143
What's stopping you?

35:51.282 --> 35:52.544
Nothing.

35:54.218 --> 35:55.549
- Wow.
- Wow.

35:58.623 --> 36:00.488
She gets it tomorrow. I made a reservation

36:00.558 --> 36:02.822
at some fancy French restaurant
on the Upper East Side.

36:02.894 --> 36:06.125
Oh, my God. You're doing it
in front of a room full of strangers?

36:06.197 --> 36:10.861
- Yeah, I am. What's wrong with that?
- No, nothing. I think it shows confidence.

36:10.935 --> 36:11.993
What are you gonna say?

36:12.069 --> 36:14.970
- I'm still working on it. I don't know.
- Oh, you should work on it with me.

36:15.039 --> 36:19.567
You should practice with me.
I'm really good at that. I will be Emily.

36:19.644 --> 36:24.047
I'm Emily, your college sweetheart.
Is there something you wanted to ask me?

36:24.115 --> 36:26.379
- Emily...
- Wait! You've got to get down on your knee.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.418
No, I'm not getting down on my knee.

36:28.486 --> 36:31.011
She'll like it.
She'll like seeing you down on your knee.

36:31.088 --> 36:36.151
- I'm not getting down on my knee.
- Such a mistake. Okay.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.559
- Emily.
- Yes, William.

36:38.629 --> 36:40.995
Don't make me laugh. Emily,

36:41.465 --> 36:42.989
will you,

36:43.834 --> 36:44.858
um,

36:46.704 --> 36:48.171
marry me?

36:48.973 --> 36:52.067
- No.
- Oh, my God.

36:52.143 --> 36:53.974
<i>Well, what do you mean,
"Will you, um, marry me?"</i>

36:54.045 --> 36:55.637
I haven't seen you in weeks!

36:55.713 --> 36:58.841
You don't look happy or excited
about the prospect of our marriage!

36:58.916 --> 37:02.818
You're asking me to give up my freedom,

37:02.887 --> 37:04.286
<i>my joie de vivre</i>

37:04.355 --> 37:06.949
for an institution that fails
as often as it succeeds?

37:07.024 --> 37:10.858
And why should I marry you, anyway?
I mean, why do you wanna marry me?

37:10.928 --> 37:14.386
Besides some bourgeois desire to fulfill
an ideal that society embeds in us

37:14.465 --> 37:17.366
from an early age to promote
a consumer capitalist agenda?

37:17.435 --> 37:18.459
Oh!

37:18.936 --> 37:20.904
Oh, my God!

37:20.972 --> 37:24.135
- You should've got on your knee!
- Just shut up!

37:26.177 --> 37:27.474
Here.

37:28.779 --> 37:31.304
I wanna marry you
because you're the first person

37:31.382 --> 37:33.475
that I want to look at
when I wake up in the morning

37:33.551 --> 37:36.179
and the only one I wanna kiss goodnight.

37:36.254 --> 37:40.054
Because the first time
that I saw these hands,

37:40.791 --> 37:43.351
I couldn't imagine
not being able to hold them.

37:43.427 --> 37:47.090
But mainly, when you love someone
as much as I love you

37:49.700 --> 37:52.032
getting married is the only thing left to do.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.537
So will you...

37:57.541 --> 37:58.667
Um...

38:01.512 --> 38:03.036
marry me?

38:03.914 --> 38:06.144
Definitely. Maybe.

38:07.618 --> 38:09.745
I have to think about it.

38:11.856 --> 38:13.380
Walk me home?

38:23.734 --> 38:26.828
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Yeah. I'd love one.

38:30.074 --> 38:31.302
Hey.

38:31.375 --> 38:33.707
<i>How come you have so many copies
of Jane Eyre?</i>

38:33.778 --> 38:36.542
- It's a long story.
- Really?

38:37.481 --> 38:39.472
It seems to be about 300 pages or so.

38:41.419 --> 38:43.011
Seriously, why?

38:44.322 --> 38:48.190
For my 13th birthday,
I wanted a pair of gold stud earrings,

38:48.259 --> 38:52.457
<i>and instead my dad bought me
a hardcover copy of Jane Eyre.</i>

38:52.530 --> 38:56.796
And inside, he wrote a beautiful inscription,
which I could care less about at the time

38:56.867 --> 38:59.597
seeing as I was so pissed
about the earrings,

38:59.670 --> 39:04.573
which was tragic as it turned out 'cause
it was the last present he ever gave me.

39:04.642 --> 39:06.041
What do you mean?

39:06.110 --> 39:09.102
He died three weeks later in a car accident.

39:09.547 --> 39:12.710
Jesus. That's awful.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.083
I'm sorry.

39:15.419 --> 39:18.252
- Have you ever read it?
- No.

39:18.322 --> 39:21.416
I read it every year or two.
Each time it's different.

39:21.492 --> 39:23.790
It tells me different things.

39:24.829 --> 39:29.698
Anyhow, when I went away to college,
my mom sold our house

39:29.767 --> 39:32.600
<i>and somewhere along the way,
Jane Eyre got lost.</i>

39:32.670 --> 39:35.935
Now, every time I pass
a second-hand bookstore,

39:36.006 --> 39:38.998
I look for the copy that my dad
bought me for my birthday.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.606
I know I'll never find it.

39:41.679 --> 39:46.514
It's stupid, but it's become this,
like, weird superstitious little...

39:46.584 --> 39:49.917
- It's not stupid.
- Thanks. Hobby.

39:50.788 --> 39:52.722
What are all these?

39:52.857 --> 39:57.021
Oh, these are the ones
I found that have inscriptions.

39:59.730 --> 40:04.030
<i>"With love and hopes and dreams
of second chances. Alice."</i>

40:07.104 --> 40:08.332
What is this?

40:08.406 --> 40:12.206
This is Kurt Cobain.
This is Nirvana. Do you like it?

40:13.144 --> 40:14.736
Yeah, I do.

40:16.280 --> 40:19.113
You think it's ridiculous
that I want to be a politician, don't you?

40:19.183 --> 40:20.946
- Yes.
- Thank you.

40:21.552 --> 40:25.818
No, no, I get the whole politician thing.
It's easy to like you.

40:25.890 --> 40:28.654
That's true. That's very true.

40:28.726 --> 40:32.685
I just wonder if you want people
to like you a little too much.

40:33.097 --> 40:35.031
That's also true.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.999
I should want them to hate me.

40:37.568 --> 40:40.093
I'm gonna start working on that right away.
You got any tips for me?

40:40.171 --> 40:41.832
No, but you're off to a great start.

40:41.906 --> 40:42.964
- Yeah?
- I'm hating you already.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.132
Good.

40:44.208 --> 40:45.766
What do you wanna be when you grow up?

40:45.843 --> 40:48.107
I mean, you're too smart
to be making Xeroxes

40:48.179 --> 40:49.510
- and babysitting.
- No.

40:49.580 --> 40:52.606
- I don't know!
- Whatever else you do.

40:52.683 --> 40:56.312
I don't know,
and I don't know how to know. You know?

40:58.756 --> 41:01.054
You know what I really wanna do

41:01.125 --> 41:04.925
is I wanna go to all those places
that I know nothing about.

41:06.063 --> 41:08.156
I've been saving money.

41:08.232 --> 41:10.291
But I can't even get it together to do that.

41:10.367 --> 41:12.835
Probably because I'm stuck in a rut
with this guy.

41:12.903 --> 41:14.564
You should dump him.

41:14.638 --> 41:19.507
I know that's none of my business,
but you're too good for him.

41:19.877 --> 41:21.242
You are.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.976
- You know what's really cool?
- I don't.

41:26.050 --> 41:29.781
We can just sit here
and we don't have to worry about

41:29.854 --> 41:34.086
- flirting or all the attraction stuff.
- All that stuff.

41:35.192 --> 41:36.523
Very cool.

41:37.061 --> 41:38.187
Yeah.

41:55.045 --> 41:56.876
I got to go.

42:00.951 --> 42:02.316
Dumbass!

43:07.117 --> 43:09.210
- Oh, God.
- There he is!

43:09.286 --> 43:13.052
- Told you he wouldn't be long.
- Hi! I wanted to surprise you!

43:13.123 --> 43:16.490
- I took the red-eye!
- That's incredible!

43:17.394 --> 43:22.559
I was just telling Emily how Arthur sent you
to Albany as part of the advance team.

43:22.633 --> 43:24.624
- Advance team.
- Yeah. How'd it go?

43:24.702 --> 43:27.933
- How'd it go? Man, it went great!
- Great.

43:28.005 --> 43:29.495
- Great.
- Great.

43:30.040 --> 43:33.669
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I was just getting a little exercise.

43:33.744 --> 43:35.473
- I ran up the stairs.
- Okay.

43:35.546 --> 43:39.915
I'm going to the office. It's...
Got a big day. Nice meeting you.

43:39.984 --> 43:41.076
- And you.
- Okay.

43:41.151 --> 43:42.311
Okay.

43:43.287 --> 43:44.686
Good luck.

43:47.891 --> 43:49.358
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:50.594 --> 43:52.721
- Here.
- Yeah.

43:54.865 --> 43:56.127
Hey.

44:04.341 --> 44:07.538
- It's weird. Your tongue tastes different.
- What?

44:08.312 --> 44:09.870
It tastes different, your tongue.

44:09.947 --> 44:13.576
- That is weird.
- It's not bad. It's just different.

44:14.785 --> 44:17.049
Maybe it's the tap water here.

44:17.121 --> 44:20.522
Or the pH balance...
I don't know what I'm talking about.

44:20.591 --> 44:23.492
Told you New York was gonna change you.

44:24.795 --> 44:27.059
- Could we maybe go for a walk?
- Yeah.

44:27.131 --> 44:29.497
- Just to get some air?
- Yeah, you could see New York.

44:29.566 --> 44:30.760
I would love that.

44:31.168 --> 44:32.760
So, did I ever tell you...
- I was gonna...

44:32.836 --> 44:34.963
- Oh, sorry. No, go.
- What?

44:35.639 --> 44:41.441
I was gonna say, did I ever tell you
about the day my dad proposed to my mom?

44:41.979 --> 44:43.003
No.

44:44.014 --> 44:47.279
Well, Dad was on his way
to meet my mom to propose,

44:47.351 --> 44:51.651
and he runs into his ex-girlfriend,
Caroline Hopper.

44:52.723 --> 44:55.191
And they're talking,
they're looking at each other,

44:55.259 --> 44:57.193
and all these old feelings,
they start coming up.

44:57.261 --> 44:59.388
And he's thinking,

45:00.631 --> 45:03.759
<i>"I could run away right now
with Caroline Hopper,</i>

45:03.834 --> 45:05.529
<i>"be a happy man.</i>

45:05.602 --> 45:07.695
<i>"All I have to do is kiss her."</i>

45:07.771 --> 45:10.831
But instead, he looks up,

45:13.777 --> 45:17.213
and he sees my mom
walking around the corner.

45:17.948 --> 45:21.349
And that moment he knows
that he had no reason to be afraid.

45:21.418 --> 45:23.079
You understand?

45:25.489 --> 45:28.720
Am I Caroline Hopper in this story
or your mom?

45:30.094 --> 45:31.288
Oh, my God! I'm your mom!

45:31.361 --> 45:33.158
- Emily, when I saw you this morning...
- Will, please.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.595
...I knew...
- Put that back in your pocket.

45:34.665 --> 45:36.189
- Just stand up, Will. Stop.
...with absolute clarity.

45:36.266 --> 45:37.563
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I have no reason to be afraid.

45:37.634 --> 45:38.931
- Let's think about this.
- I'm not afraid of this.

45:39.002 --> 45:40.264
It's just like the day that my...

45:40.337 --> 45:41.497
Will!

45:42.139 --> 45:43.470
I slept with Charlie!

45:50.447 --> 45:52.608
I thought we had a plan.

45:53.350 --> 45:57.013
Well, you had a plan, Will.
You have a really big plan!

45:57.087 --> 45:59.078
- Pretty sure we both had that plan.
- I just can't keep pretending

45:59.156 --> 46:00.817
- that I want to be part of it anymore.
- You were there

46:00.891 --> 46:02.518
- when we made it.
- And I didn't know how to tell you.

46:02.593 --> 46:03.855
How do you tell someone
that you care about

46:03.927 --> 46:05.019
that you don't want the same things

46:05.095 --> 46:06.494
- they want anymore?
- The best way?

46:06.563 --> 46:09.361
Definitely having sex with the roommate.

46:11.335 --> 46:13.803
It was cowardly, and I'm sorry.

46:13.871 --> 46:15.600
Oh, good.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.441
You're killing me.

46:26.083 --> 46:28.984
No, I'm not. I'm letting you go.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.979
'Cause if we stay together, Will,
we're gonna be miserable.

46:32.055 --> 46:33.283
I'm gonna hold you back from all these...

46:33.357 --> 46:36.622
- That's not true.
...incredible dreams that you have.

46:36.693 --> 46:39.526
And then, eventually,
you're totally gonna hate me for it.

46:39.596 --> 46:40.858
- No.
- Yes.

46:40.931 --> 46:44.128
Will, I don't want that,
and you don't want that.

46:45.035 --> 46:46.434
Trust me.

46:51.074 --> 46:53.975
You're gonna be just fine, Mr. Hayes,

46:54.912 --> 46:56.573
without me.

46:57.981 --> 46:59.073
Wow.

46:59.583 --> 47:00.777
Yeah.

47:01.752 --> 47:02.878
Wow.

47:03.587 --> 47:06.818
<i>Here is Tom Brokaw in New York.</i>

47:06.890 --> 47:09.484
<i>Good evening. Bill Clinton may have
been wounded in New York,</i>

47:09.560 --> 47:11.391
<i>but the big question tonight is,
to what degree?</i>

47:11.461 --> 47:14.862
<i>Because, after all, he is the big survivor,
indeed, the victor</i>

47:14.932 --> 47:18.390
<i>in the New York primary
and by a comfortable margin.</i>

47:33.617 --> 47:36.142
<i>Goes 'round the moon</i>

47:36.620 --> 47:41.387
<i>I see the passion in your eyes</i>

47:41.458 --> 47:46.361
<i>Sometimes it's all a big surprise</i>

47:46.430 --> 47:50.696
<i>'Cause there was a time when all I did</i>

48:04.581 --> 48:06.310
Hey.

48:06.617 --> 48:08.312
Congratulations.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.354
I hear they asked you to stay on.
You must be very happy.

48:11.421 --> 48:15.323
Yeah, yeah, he did, and I am.
Very, very happy.

48:15.392 --> 48:17.952
Really? Why do I feel
like I should hide the razor blades?

48:18.028 --> 48:19.689
And the staplers and those scissors?

48:19.763 --> 48:23.460
I'll be fine. But this song,
it's an excellent cure for the will to live.

48:23.533 --> 48:26.593
I know. What about the dancing?
Make that end.

48:29.873 --> 48:32.637
I'm sorry about the other night.

48:32.709 --> 48:35.542
It's okay. I just didn't think
that Lucas would approve.

48:35.612 --> 48:38.479
- Or Emily, for that matter.
- Well.

48:38.548 --> 48:42.382
Besides, you and me,
it'd kind of be like cats and dogs.

48:43.086 --> 48:44.747
Yeah. Yeah.

48:46.156 --> 48:49.683
- Oil and water.
- Sandpaper and bare ass.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.887
- That's gross. That's just gross.
- You'd be the ass.

48:51.962 --> 48:53.054
Yeah. No, thank you.

48:53.130 --> 48:54.461
- I'd be honored.
- Lennon and McCartney.

48:54.531 --> 48:56.158
- They were good together.
- Yeah, while it lasted,

48:56.233 --> 48:58.929
and then they couldn't even be friends.

49:00.504 --> 49:04.270
- I think we can, at least, manage that.
- I think we could.

49:07.411 --> 49:09.402
<i>- Enchanté.
- Yeah. Salud.</i>

49:13.450 --> 49:15.384
- Come on, let's dance.
- No.

49:15.452 --> 49:16.942
- Why?
- Okay.

49:23.527 --> 49:25.927
You ready?
- Yeah.

49:36.206 --> 49:38.071
Guess that's it for Emily.

49:38.141 --> 49:42.134
I can't believe that
she rehearsed with Charlie.

49:43.647 --> 49:48.107
- I can't believe it, either.
- That leaves April. Maybe Summer.

49:48.185 --> 49:50.415
- Anybody else?
- I was too busy.

49:50.487 --> 49:52.853
I was too busy working on the campaign.

49:52.923 --> 49:54.584
Anyway, when Clinton got elected,

49:54.658 --> 49:55.886
<i>Russell and I started our own
consulting firm,</i>

49:57.060 --> 49:59.722
<i>and we worked on campaigns for everybody.</i>

49:59.796 --> 50:01.286
<i>City council, state senate.</i>

50:01.365 --> 50:03.356
We even did one for the local dog catcher.

50:03.433 --> 50:07.335
That's very interesting, Dad,
but what about girlfriends?

50:07.404 --> 50:10.396
- What about Mom?
- Well, I started dating again.

50:10.474 --> 50:14.205
- But nothing serious.
- What about April? What happened to her?

50:14.277 --> 50:17.906
Well, a week after Kurt Cobain died,
she broke up with her boyfriend.

50:17.981 --> 50:19.448
<i>She went traveling.</i>

50:19.516 --> 50:22.417
<i>She traveled all over the world,
just like she always dreamed of doing.</i>

50:22.486 --> 50:26.149
<i>And she says
that it was because of something</i>

50:26.223 --> 50:28.088
<i>that I said to her on her birthday.</i>

50:28.158 --> 50:31.150
<i>Anyway, we started writing postcards.
We started writing letters.</i>

50:31.228 --> 50:34.561
<i>And before I knew it, even though
we were separated by entire worlds,</i>

50:34.631 --> 50:36.656
<i>we became great friends.</i>

50:41.238 --> 50:44.571
<i>It was 1994,
and New York was full of new life.</i>

50:44.641 --> 50:46.370
<i>More jobs, more money.</i>

50:46.443 --> 50:49.935
<i>That was the start of the Internet.
And overnight, everyone in Manhattan</i>

50:50.013 --> 50:51.002
<i>had a cell phone.</i>

50:51.081 --> 50:52.105
Can you hear me now?

50:52.182 --> 50:54.013
<i>Which they never put down.</i>

50:55.886 --> 51:01.552
<i>And then, our old boss, Arthur Robredo
gave Russell and me our first big break.</i>

51:01.625 --> 51:03.217
- This just came for you.
- Thanks.

51:03.293 --> 51:07.423
<i>I had finally made it inside the room.</i>

51:07.898 --> 51:09.195
- Gareth.
- Hayes.

51:09.266 --> 51:10.528
Good morning.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.261
Hey, let's get this party started.

51:12.969 --> 51:14.334
What's the word from upstate?

51:14.404 --> 51:17.168
<i>For the first time,
New York was coming to me,</i>

51:17.240 --> 51:19.401
<i>instead of the other way around.</i>

51:19.476 --> 51:22.809
<i>"The most endangered species in our nation</i>

51:22.879 --> 51:25.712
<i>"isn't a big woodpecker
or some freshwater fish.</i>

51:25.782 --> 51:28.478
<i>"It's the tongue in our heads!</i>

51:28.552 --> 51:32.283
<i>"Listen to the truncated
bastard language of today.</i>

51:32.355 --> 51:35.256
<i>"The average vocabulary is a third
of what it was 100 years ago.</i>

51:35.325 --> 51:39.762
<i>"Words fall out of our mouths
and die at our feet!</i>

51:39.830 --> 51:42.890
<i>"The landscape of vocabulary
is being hacked down</i>

51:42.966 --> 51:46.663
<i>"and grubbed up by the dribble
of pop culture,</i>

51:46.736 --> 51:48.226
<i>"poisoned by lazy obscenity..."</i>

51:48.305 --> 51:49.363
Will?

51:49.439 --> 51:51.168
<i>"... infantilized by
a youth-obsessed media..."</i>

51:51.241 --> 51:52.936
- Hey.
- Hey.

51:53.810 --> 51:58.543
It's my favorite man-boy.
You look very manly.

51:58.615 --> 52:02.051
Well, thank you, thank you. That's the aim.

52:02.819 --> 52:05.287
- How's Emily?
- Emily.

52:06.389 --> 52:09.119
She's starring in
somebody else's diary now.

52:09.226 --> 52:10.215
Oh.

52:10.694 --> 52:14.994
- How's the Professor?
- The Professor is wonderful.

52:15.065 --> 52:18.364
- He's funny.
- He dumped me for a sophomore.

52:19.202 --> 52:21.534
Told me it was for my own good.

52:22.506 --> 52:25.737
Everybody seems to be
using that line these days.

52:27.577 --> 52:29.511
What have you been up to?

52:30.547 --> 52:35.814
<i>I'm writing these really dumb items
for New York Magazine.</i>

52:35.886 --> 52:37.717
Waiting for my big break.

52:37.787 --> 52:41.951
<i>"And 'syntax' isn't
what Nevada brothels pay the IRS."</i>

52:43.193 --> 52:45.559
- I'm gonna go listen to the Professor.
- Sure.

52:45.629 --> 52:46.687
Nice glasses.

52:46.763 --> 52:49.561
"Listen to your kids if you can."

52:49.633 --> 52:51.760
Thank you.
- Scotch, rocks, please.

52:52.602 --> 52:55.162
William Hayes!

52:57.107 --> 52:59.405
From... Don't tell me!

52:59.476 --> 53:02.639
Wisconsin! Yes, the Cheese State.

53:04.781 --> 53:06.373
Very nice of you
to come to our little shindig.

53:06.449 --> 53:07.814
- I'll have another, please.
- Pleasure.

53:07.884 --> 53:12.082
Yeah. Summer tells me you're writing
speeches now for Arthur Robredo?

53:12.155 --> 53:16.421
- She tells me you're dating a sophomore.
- No. Actually, it's two freshmen,

53:16.493 --> 53:19.929
which, on a good day,
add up to a sophomore, I suppose.

53:21.198 --> 53:24.759
Walk with me. Why would you
wanna work for a hack like Arthur Robredo?

53:24.834 --> 53:30.466
As I recall from our first encounter,
you're a man of principles and ideals, even.

53:31.141 --> 53:35.475
Don't tell me you're just another
yuppie puppy in an Armani suit.

53:35.545 --> 53:39.208
You were wonderful, darling.
Is he being nice? You being nice?

53:39.282 --> 53:42.251
- Nice? Yeah, he can handle himself.
- Sure, I can handle myself.

53:42.319 --> 53:45.846
First of all, Arthur Robredo is not a hack.
He's worked his way up from the streets.

53:45.922 --> 53:48.049
He was a cop, an entrepreneur.

53:48.491 --> 53:52.052
He's a putz.
This is exactly what my book is about.

53:52.128 --> 53:54.028
Here. Read it. It's free.

53:54.998 --> 53:59.196
Beauty, ideals,
love don't mean squat anymore.

53:59.269 --> 54:02.067
- It's all about power and money.
- I've read every single one of your books,

54:02.138 --> 54:04.197
and you're completely obsessed
with power and money.

54:04.274 --> 54:06.765
That's because he doesn't have any.
Right, babe?

54:06.843 --> 54:09.368
Babe, I am about the love.

54:09.446 --> 54:10.811
- As you know.
- Yes.

54:10.880 --> 54:11.904
That's why you keep me around.

54:11.982 --> 54:15.713
To keep that rampant,
rapacious ambition of yours in check.

54:17.254 --> 54:18.949
I have a thought.

54:19.456 --> 54:24.120
Why don't you use that newly acquired
scintilla of power and influence

54:24.194 --> 54:29.222
to get Summer here
to write an article about your man Robredo?

54:29.299 --> 54:32.496
That way Summer gets a break,
and you get the word out.

54:32.569 --> 54:34.628
- What do you get, Hampton?
- Yeah.

54:35.505 --> 54:39.999
I guess it's the love. More of the love.
Yeah, that's what I'm about.

54:40.076 --> 54:41.270
More love.

54:41.344 --> 54:43.608
I knew Summer would be back.
- Did you?

54:43.680 --> 54:45.739
You know what? At first,
I didn't want Summer to be my mom.

54:45.815 --> 54:48.375
But now I'm kinda liking her.
Did you ask her out on a date?

54:48.451 --> 54:49.440
Uh-uh.

54:49.552 --> 54:52.953
I wanted to, but I couldn't
'cause she was writing the article.

55:14.444 --> 55:19.541
- Wow. This is pretty good.
- Will, this is really good.

55:24.954 --> 55:26.922
<i>Are you sure
it didn't seem like a puff piece?</i>

55:26.990 --> 55:29.515
No, it's perfect. It's absolutely...

55:29.592 --> 55:33.528
You know, there's one part, though,
that kind of bothered me.

55:33.997 --> 55:35.021
<i>"William Hayes,</i>

55:35.098 --> 55:40.195
<i>"Robredo's chief speech writer,
is both intense and boyishly handsome."</i>

55:41.004 --> 55:42.631
- Boyishly? I mean...
- Yeah.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.774
You know, I originally wrote,

55:45.842 --> 55:49.334
<i>"William Hayes has seductive eyes
and the intriguing looks of someone</i>

55:49.412 --> 55:51.710
<i>"whose clothes you wanna rip
from his very body,"</i>

55:51.781 --> 55:54.875
but the editor made me change it.

55:54.951 --> 55:57.613
There's just no room for truth in journalism.

55:58.855 --> 56:00.914
Did you always want to be a journalist?

56:00.990 --> 56:05.927
No. Until I was 16, I wanted to be an actress.
I wanted to sing on Broadway.

56:05.995 --> 56:07.519
Wow. Really?

56:07.597 --> 56:10.395
Yeah, really. Is that hard to believe?

56:10.467 --> 56:14.870
Well, aren't actresses needy and emotional
and, you know, insecure?

56:14.938 --> 56:15.927
That sort of thing.

56:16.005 --> 56:19.406
What are you saying? That I don't need?
That I don't have emotions?

56:19.476 --> 56:21.171
- I'm an incredibly needy person.
- I'm not saying that.

56:21.244 --> 56:22.575
- I'm a very needy person.
- You know what I'm saying?

56:22.645 --> 56:25.273
I'm saying I would love to hear a song.

56:25.782 --> 56:27.750
- I'm sorry?
- Give us a song.

56:28.818 --> 56:31.286
- You want me to sing you a song?
- Why not?

56:33.089 --> 56:35.580
- You have a favorite?
- Yes.

56:35.658 --> 56:37.216
- You do?
- Yeah.

56:40.196 --> 56:41.185
Okay.

56:43.900 --> 56:48.360
<i>How glad the many millions</i>

56:48.438 --> 56:52.738
<i>Of Timothys and Williams would be</i>

56:52.809 --> 56:55.209
- I'm a William.
- Don't interrupt.

56:55.278 --> 56:57.439
<i>To capture me</i>

56:58.081 --> 57:01.175
<i>But you had such persistence</i>

57:01.251 --> 57:04.049
<i>You wore down my resistance</i>

57:04.120 --> 57:05.883
<i>I fell</i>

57:07.090 --> 57:08.955
<i>And it was swell</i>

57:14.431 --> 57:15.523
Wow.

57:15.598 --> 57:18.089
Will you please put it on?

57:21.571 --> 57:23.766
You know, it really isn't so bad.

57:23.840 --> 57:26.741
You know what the funny part is?
It's $1,000.

57:28.611 --> 57:35.608
<i>I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie</i>

57:35.685 --> 57:37.710
Frank Sinatra, Linda Ronstadt.

57:37.787 --> 57:39.049
- Why?
- A whole bunch of these.

57:39.122 --> 57:44.253
Well, if you look on the back,
they all have one common song, which is...

57:44.327 --> 57:46.887
<i>- I've Got A Crush On You.
- Every one of them.</i>

57:48.131 --> 57:51.532
- How's it going?
- Still got a lot to do.

57:53.102 --> 57:55.093
Yeah, me, too.

57:58.741 --> 58:00.709
- Yeah, I'm about done.
- Yeah, me, too.

58:00.777 --> 58:06.181
<i>The world will pardon my mush</i>

58:06.683 --> 58:13.486
<i>'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on...</i>

58:40.383 --> 58:42.044
Was I snoring?

58:42.685 --> 58:43.845
Uh-uh.

58:49.158 --> 58:51.456
You know what I've never done?

58:52.395 --> 58:53.589
What?

58:54.898 --> 58:58.493
I've never spent the whole day in bed
with a really great guy.

58:58.835 --> 58:59.995
Me, neither.

59:01.170 --> 59:03.365
I'm serious.

59:03.439 --> 59:06.670
I always think of something
more important to do.

59:06.743 --> 59:08.677
I'm a workaholic.

59:10.079 --> 59:11.740
It's really bad.

59:16.019 --> 59:18.817
Will you spend
the whole day in bed with me?

59:20.223 --> 59:21.884
We do nothing.

59:28.698 --> 59:29.722
Oh.

59:39.876 --> 59:42.970
<i>Hi, this is Summer. Please leave a message,
and I will call you back.</i>

59:44.247 --> 59:45.578
<i>This is Dr. Levenstein</i>

59:45.648 --> 59:48.344
<i>from the Columbia Presbyterian
emergency room. We have...</i>

59:48.418 --> 59:50.579
Emergency room? Hello?

59:50.887 --> 59:54.846
- Mr. Roth has had an aortal rupture.
- What does that mean exactly?

59:54.924 --> 59:57.392
Think of it like a tire blowing out
on the highway

59:57.460 --> 59:59.860
after going too fast for way too long.

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:05.399
How's that, Mr. Roth? Are you comfortable?

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:06.799
I make a living.

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:13.536
Come on, sweetheart, give me a smile.
I've waited my whole life to do that joke.

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:16.902
Poor Hampton.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.604
Ow!

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:20.672
Summer's come.

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:26.482
- What's he doing here?
- Hello, Hampton.

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:27.716
Hello.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.324
One thing they've left intact.

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.762
No, no, no, no, no, no,
don't mention grassroots.

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:36.821
Don't mention osmosis.

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:39.197
It's killing me
that you're going out with the kid.

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:43.864
Really? It's not the booze
or the cigarettes or the sophomores?

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.807
- That has nothing to do with this.
- Nothing to do with it.

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:51.279
Listen, I want you to know
I've donated my organs to medical science

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:53.679
except for one, which is for you.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:59.783
- Sweetie, that's so kind.
- No, no, not that.

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:02.188
My heart, stupid.

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:08.658
Please tell me you're not in love with him.

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:10.460
I can't do that.

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:17.830
Can I have a cigarette?
Just a dying man's last request.

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:21.809
Not happening.
God, you're such a drama queen.

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:23.539
Nobody's dying.

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:28.850
What do you care
if I'm in love with him, huh?

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:30.943
You're the one who set us up, remember?

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.853
Yeah, well, I kind of figured
you'd chew him up and spit him out.

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:37.256
You're such a sweetie.
You're a sweet guy, you know that?

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:41.319
- I read the Robredo piece.
- Yeah.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.660
The guy's been in New York politics
for over 20 years

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:50.331
and all you can dig up
is that his daughter had an eating disorder?

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.705
What are you saying, Hampton?

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:55.810
Do your job.

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:07.147
I can't believe
we're finally gonna meet the President.

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:10.325
- Look at that.
- Look at it.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.884
We've come a long way
from that hotel room on 8th Avenue.

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:14.395
Thank you very much.

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.989
I don't believe it! I don't believe it!

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:19.830
Which idiot forgot to check the menus
and the programs?

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:22.166
There's no union seal
on the menus or the programs.

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.262
Are you serious?

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:24.931
The hotel workers won't let anybody
into the building.

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.372
The Teamsters
won't set up the satellite feed!

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:28.171
Has anyone seen Robert Klein?

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.711
I was with him like an hour ago.
Now he's gone.

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:31.269
I think he was completely plastered.

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:32.905
How are we supposed to know
where Robert Klein is?

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:35.416
You're not gonna believe this,
but there's a hailstorm in Chicago.

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:36.782
Who cares about Chicago?

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:38.787
We do.
The President's coming in from Chicago.

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:40.447
- Okay, okay.
- We can't worry about that right now.

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:42.491
Let me ask you a question.
How could you let this happen?

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:44.992
- What? What are you talking about?
- Why are you jumping down her throat?

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:47.086
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, guys, guys, guys, hey!

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:50.997
Hey, deep breath, okay?
Look, let's just ask the hotel,

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:53.001
see if we can use the Internet connection
and find a printer.

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:54.593
- I'll call Klein's agent.
- Great.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.103
Gareth, have a drink.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:58.663
You, I don't know who you are,
but your fly's down.

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:01.369
Be great if you wore underwear.
I'm gonna go check the weather in Chicago.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:05.471
Table seven's up. Six pasta. Two fish.
Get it out the door, now!

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:10.642
He may not be in your union,

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.280
but he still happens to be
the President of the United States.

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:14.755
Remember him? So if I was you,

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:16.758
- I'd get your men off that truck and in this...
- Gareth!

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:19.386
You can't talk to a Teamster like that!
Come on.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.793
- This guy...
- Everything's gonna be fine.

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:21.887
Look, look, check it out.

01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:23.363
I downloaded a copy of the union seal.

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:25.024
If you could just please
paste it onto a menu,

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:28.127
make 500 copies, use a union shop.
We're gonna be home free, here.

01:03:28.204 --> 01:03:30.365
Copies? You want me to make copies?

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:35.504
Well, at some point, we all make copies.
Your time is now.

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.603
That's not funny, Hayes. That's very...

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.046
Yeah, that's real mature.
Where are you going?

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:42.346
I'm walking! Back in half an hour.

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.079
What a dick.

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.280
<i>- Yeah.
- William Hayes?</i>

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:49.517
Speaking.

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:52.083
<i>I'm watching you right now.</i>

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:55.426
<i>And I know all about you
and your friend Robredo.</i>

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:58.831
<i>In fact, I know so much,
I could bring you both down.</i>

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.232
Really?

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:05.132
<i>- Who am I speaking with?
- Why don't we meet, and you'll find out?</i>

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:08.337
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm close by.</i>

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:13.572
I don't have a lot of experience with
whatever this is.

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:15.940
<i>You're getting warm.</i>

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.084
<i>You're hot.</i>

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:21.479
<i>You're hot.</i>

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:23.889
You are so hot!

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:27.587
I got you!

01:04:29.098 --> 01:04:30.656
I thought you were gone
through the summer.

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:33.896
No, I thought so, too,
but this crazy thing happened.

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:37.098
I mean, I was camping
on this beautiful beach in Crete

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:40.734
with all these really cool people,
and there was this guy that I liked, Paco,

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:44.177
brooding and sexy,
monosyllabic and totally my type.

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:47.148
One night I'm dancing with Paco
and he kisses me,

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:49.810
- an incredible, deep kiss.
- Spare me the details.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.320
- And what do I do?
- I don't know. What'd you do?

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:53.650
I start crying.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.157
- I mean, tears are rolling down my cheeks...
- Of course you start crying.

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:59.683
...which he doesn't notice 'cause, of course,
his hands are all over my body,

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:02.322
which felt nice,
which made me feel even more upset,

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.956
'cause in a flash

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:07.730
I saw our entire relationship,
from present to future tense.

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:12.638
I mean, the incredibly hot start, with Paco
basking in my love and admiration...

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:15.234
- What are we doing here?
- I just got to pick something up.

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:16.335
Just take a second.

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:19.279
And then the inevitable moment,
and I don't know why it...

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:20.645
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:23.276
I don't know why it happens,
but it always does,

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.616
when all that love and admiration
would start to irritate him

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:27.849
and he'd find some way to hurt me.

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:30.449
I mean, sure, after, he'd be sorry.

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:32.187
So...

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:36.129
I decided to unlock his beautiful lips
from mine,

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:38.359
remove his hand from my ass,

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:44.234
- and I walked away.
- Good move.

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:47.037
- I walked away, Will! From Paco!
- Good move.

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:49.600
- No one walks away from Paco!
- I like the story.

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:51.943
And it felt life-changing.

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:54.312
And I realized I had to tell someone.

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:56.408
When I realized who that person was,

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.476
- it was so unexpected.
- Here we are, sir.

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:00.385
It's like when something is staring you
in the face

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:03.482
and it's like you're too blind to see it.

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:04.890
What's that?

01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:09.159
I have some news for you, too.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.534
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why are you so upset?

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:19.631
Don't you think it's a little weird we've been
writing each other for however long

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:21.677
and somehow you neglect to tell me that,

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:26.374
A, you've fallen in love,
and, B, you've fallen in love!

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.041
- I told you I was dating someone.
- Dating someone.

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:30.813
You just bought
a diamond engagement ring for someone!

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:32.979
I'm sorry.
I think I was just nervous to tell you.

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:35.683
Why would you be nervous to tell me?

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.054
I don't know.

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:41.620
I love this girl so much.

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:45.659
I'd just really like you to be happy for me.

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:50.599
I can be happy for you.
Of course I can be happy for you.

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.868
<i>Poor April.</i>

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:59.414
<i>She's like the character in the story
who's always been the friend.</i>

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:02.542
Then she realized
she doesn't just want to be the friend.

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:05.587
She wants to be the girlfriend,
except it's too late.

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.087
What do you mean?

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:10.284
Weren't you listening?
She came home for you.

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:18.489
There's union seals
on all the menus, my friend.

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:22.230
The weather cleared in Chicago.
The President will be here by 8:00.

01:07:22.304 --> 01:07:23.464
Where's Russ?

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:25.268
Gonna meet you and Arthur
in the restaurant.

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:27.002
<i>I'm funnier over here.</i>

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:31.206
<i>I can't stop my leg</i>

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:38.884
You're early.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.184
Good to see you.

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:48.093
- You look great.
- Thank you. You, too.

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:51.327
- That's a nice tie.
- Well, you'd know.

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:56.395
So, the magazine asked me
to do a follow-up on Robredo.

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:59.464
- Great.
- Yeah, it is great. It's also...

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:02.104
It's...

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:05.773
You just read it.

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:07.679
- You already wrote it.
- Yeah.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.089
- He did this?
- Yes.

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:23.598
They actually got a friend an early parole.

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:28.365
You know what?
I think it happened such a long time ago,

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:30.371
and you're way ahead in all the polls.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:35.103
Yeah, see, I don't think that's gonna matter,
because he's the tough-on-crime Democrat.

01:08:35.176 --> 01:08:36.644
That's...

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:39.272
When people read this...

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:43.915
Summer, listen to me.

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:47.046
If you hand this in, we won't survive it.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.785
I think it'll be a big deal for about a week,
and then the storm will pass...

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:52.089
I'm talking about you and me.

01:08:53.595 --> 01:08:57.157
<i>"Candidate Brought Down
by Speechwriter's Girlfriend."</i>

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:59.792
- Come on.
- I'm just doing my job.

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:03.428
I didn't do it the first time around.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:06.964
And if I didn't write this,
somebody else would.

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.170
Let them.

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:12.078
Hey, don't hand this in, okay?

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.685
You already did.

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:37.068
Mr. Arthur...

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:39.874
Yeah, sure.

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:42.133
I really liked Summer.

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.076
I can't believe
she turned out to be such a...

01:09:44.145 --> 01:09:45.340
- Heartbreaker?
- No.

01:09:45.413 --> 01:09:47.712
- Opportunist? Double-crossing...
- Uh-uh.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.683
- Bitch.
- Maya.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:51.617
How could she do that to you?

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:55.282
It's like she said. If she didn't write it,
someone else would have.

01:09:55.357 --> 01:09:56.881
And it was the truth.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:59.291
So did she? Did she break it?

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:00.726
What?

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.600
What happened when the article came out?

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:28.450
You screwed up, man.
You really screwed up.

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:30.219
Please save it.
I don't need to hear this right now.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:32.556
Whenever I figure out whatever
I'm supposed to learn from all this,

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:34.960
- I'll write you a letter!
- Yeah, can't wait.

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:40.161
<i>So I lost my girl,
I lost my job, and I lost my friend.</i>

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:44.834
<i>And for a long time,
nothing seemed to matter.</i>

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:47.872
<i>But I wasn't the only one with problems.</i>

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:52.778
<i>I did not have
sexual relations with that woman,</i>

01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:53.906
<i>Miss Lewinsky.</i>

01:10:55.117 --> 01:10:56.448
<i>I never told anybody to lie.</i>

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:58.280
- Hello?
- Are you watching?

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:00.481
<i>These allegations are false.</i>

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:01.614
April?

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:05.649
Yeah, April. Who'd you think it was?
Are you watching or not?

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:07.559
Of course I'm watching.

01:11:08.697 --> 01:11:10.164
You think he did it, don't you?

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:14.862
I don't think, I know.
Look at the picture of her. I love her.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.768
<i>She's so his type.</i>

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:21.933
So, what took you so long
to finally call me back there, red?

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:23.706
I thought I lost you.

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:27.772
<i>- Feels like years.
- I'm calling you now, aren't I?</i>

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:29.906
Yeah.

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:32.849
<i>How are you? What's doing?</i>

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.980
I got a new roommate, Olivia.

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:38.216
<i>And I'm working at a bookstore.</i>

01:11:38.827 --> 01:11:41.125
<i>But I've been thinking about
going back to school.</i>

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:42.424
<i>Cool.</i>

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:44.227
<i>Hey, did I tell you that I hate my job?</i>

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.962
<i>I used to love what I do,
and now I feel like a complete hack.</i>

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:52.766
<i>- Are you seeing anyone?
- Me? Am I... No, no. Absolutely not.</i>

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:55.742
<i>In fact, I haven't had sex
since Clinton was re-elected.</i>

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:58.871
<i>Why bother? He's having enough sex
for the entire country.</i>

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:00.938
<i>Easy. Easy now.</i>

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:04.315
<i>Hey, maybe you should
follow his lead and seduce an intern.</i>

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:06.684
<i>You know, it's funny
that you should mention that.</i>

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:10.657
<i>There's a fetching young intern
who just started a week ago.</i>

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:12.489
<i>Great. Ask her out.</i>

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:15.093
<i>I should, shouldn't I?</i>

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:19.933
<i>But I don't think I will.
You see, I don't want a fling.</i>

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.061
<i>I want the real deal.</i>

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:25.402
<i>Forget about the real deal.
You don't find it, it finds you.</i>

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:28.602
What does that mean?
I don't know what that means.

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:31.908
It means that you get to a certain age
and then you're ready.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:35.245
You know, you're ready for kids
or a commitment or, you know...

01:12:35.317 --> 01:12:36.716
- Sir.
...a mortgage.

01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:38.810
- Table's ready. Okay.
- Thanks.

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:39.945
You know what I mean?

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:43.150
And the person that you're with then,
they become the one.

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:45.989
So you're saying it's not who, but it's when.

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:47.790
- Exactly.
- Okay. All right.

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:51.924
So there's never been a guy, ever,
that made you think, "This is it.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.900
<i>"This is him. This is the one."</i>

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:55.630
No.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:59.364
Okay, then why aren't you out there,
you know, enjoying yourself?

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:00.703
I am.

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:02.641
- You are?
- Yes.

01:13:03.412 --> 01:13:05.642
Right now I'm seeing this guy, Kevin.

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:07.942
- Kevin.
- Kevin.

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:09.313
Who the hell's Kevin?

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.718
Where did... How come you never,
you know, mentioned anything about him?

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:14.517
I'm mentioning him now.

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:18.651
Oh, God! They have fresh mint tea.
I love fresh mint tea.

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.092
I love beer.

01:13:20.662 --> 01:13:24.826
<i>It depends upon
what the meaning of the word "is" is.</i>

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:30.031
<i>If it means "there is none"
that is a completely true statement.</i>

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.512
<i>Hey, this is April.</i>

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.447
<i>I want to talk to you about your birthday.
Call me.</i>

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:46.918
<i>Hello. I hope this is the right number.
It sounds like you.</i>

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:48.650
<i>It's Emily!</i>

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:52.754
<i>I'm in New York, and I was thinking</i>

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:56.127
<i>maybe we could get a cup of coffee
and catch up.</i>

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:57.859
<i>My number...</i>

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:03.804
<i>Hey, it's April. I still need to talk to you.
Please call me back.</i>

01:14:03.872 --> 01:14:05.669
<i>I mean, don't make me come over there
and hurt you.</i>

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:11.068
Okay, I'm coming!

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.911
God, I'm coming.

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.610
Yeah, I get it.

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:22.123
What are you doing in there?

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:25.052
- Is this what you're wearing?
- What?

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:28.494
It's your birthday party.
Everybody is waiting for you.

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:30.054
Oh, Christ.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.293
Five minutes, okay? Five...

01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:36.737
I'm down.
- Are you okay?

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:39.467
Yeah. I just need to lie here for a sec.

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:43.341
I see you've been eating noodles.

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:48.907
Hey, everybody, he's here!

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:55.512
Thanks.

01:14:56.892 --> 01:14:57.881
Hi.

01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:03.898
Oh, my God! I didn't think you'd be here!

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:06.264
I couldn't miss your birthday.
We came all the way up from Washington.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.064
Happy birthday, gorgeous.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.900
That is a beautiful woman right there.

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:12.600
You had your chance, pal.

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:14.005
Hayes.

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:20.745
Come on.

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:27.055
- It's great to see you.
- Yeah. You look...

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:28.612
Homeless, I know.

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:32.123
- Where's Kelly?
- She's right over there.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:34.992
It's her first night out
since the baby was born.

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:37.562
Congratulations.

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:42.833
Iran-Contra. Arms for oil, no problem.

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:46.534
But a little "oralness"
and you're headed for impeachment.

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:50.205
- No politics!
- Maybe he should be impeached.

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:52.873
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait! Did he say that?

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:55.940
- Why not? I put my faith in him. We all did.
- You love him.

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:57.645
I thought he was gonna be different
than the other jokers,

01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:00.483
but this guy,
he can't even define the word "is."

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:05.119
What happens if they give him
one of the hard words, like "truth"?

01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:08.261
- I'd vote for him again.
- In a heartbeat.

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.461
Will's a lot of fun.

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.469
Yeah, let's fill up the tub
and drop in a toaster.

01:16:15.537 --> 01:16:17.334
That should be a good time.

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:25.472
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:30.575
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:34.418
<i>Happy birthday, dear Will</i>

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:38.755
- Where is he? Where's Will?
- I don't know. I was just talking to him.

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:57.912
You missed your birthday cake.

01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:59.002
Uh-oh.

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:01.905
- And I baked it.
- You baked it.

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:06.484
Do you remember that song?

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:08.250
In your apartment?

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:12.453
<i>Come as you are, as a friend</i>

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:14.859
<i>As a known enemy</i>

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:18.832
- "Memory," not "enemy."
- I know, I know, I know.

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:23.163
- Somebody had too much to drink.
- No, I didn't.

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:24.967
I didn't, I didn't. I didn't.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.564
- Yes, you did.
- I did.

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:36.148
- God, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:41.419
What?

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:44.383
The thing is...

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.592
The thing is...

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:50.832
Is that I like you.

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:55.600
I've always liked you.

01:17:58.607 --> 01:17:59.938
<i>"Like."</i>

01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:03.333
That's pathetic. It's so puny.

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:07.441
<i>"Love" on the other hand...</i>

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:10.178
You'd run away from a word like that.

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:14.386
I love you.

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:20.220
I'm in love with you, April.

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:31.697
- Why didn't you ever tell me?
- Come on.

01:18:31.773 --> 01:18:36.107
You know exactly why I never told you.
You'd never be interested in me.

01:18:36.678 --> 01:18:38.270
You're an idiot.

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:49.189
- Stop.
- What?

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:52.055
- Not like this.
- Like what?

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:54.493
Look at you, Will, you're a mess.

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:57.623
Why couldn't you have told me
when you had your shit together?

01:18:57.699 --> 01:19:00.600
- My shit is together.
- Your shit is a mess.

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:03.495
You're a mess.

01:19:06.274 --> 01:19:08.105
My shit is a mess?

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:12.041
That's interesting, coming from you, April.

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:19.246
You could do anything on earth,
and you work in a bookstore.

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:21.312
What's that all about?

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:25.087
At least I tried. I went out there and I tried.

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:30.556
Look, I'm just saying this as a friend,
and I swear, it's just as a friend,

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:34.535
but maybe you should go out there
and, you know, get some help.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.696
Go to rehab or life rehab
or something like that.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:39.434
I don't even know if they have
that sort of thing, but if they did...

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:40.532
Okay.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.167
...you know, you could be
a prime candidate for that.

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:44.576
<i>- I should go to "life rehab"?
- Yeah.</i>

01:19:48.483 --> 01:19:50.348
Get off my front porch!

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.080
April?

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:18.510
You're right.

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:23.913
It is complicated, isn't it?

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:28.479
I mean, you're in love with April,
who used to be in love with Lucas,

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:31.117
and then she fell in love with you,
but you were in love with Summer,

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:33.889
who was always really in love with Hampton.

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:37.591
And now that you're in love with April,
she's in love with Kevin.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.661
And no one's in love with you.

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:43.568
That's complicated.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.100
Yep.

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:48.905
Then what happened?

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:11.823
<i>Jane Eyre, Random House, 1943.</i>

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:16.098
It's a beautiful edition,
known for the cover illustration.

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:20.335
But there's a really nice dedication inside,
with a quote from the book.

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:24.401
<i>"To my darling daughter, April.
'The human heart has hidden treasures</i>

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:27.107
- "'In secret kept, in silence sealed..."'
- "'In silence sealed

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:29.616
<i>"'The thoughts, the hopes
the dreams, the pleasures</i>

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:32.414
"'Whose charms were broken if revealed'

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:35.145
<i>"From your loving father."</i>

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.491
- Hi, Olivia.
- Hi, Will.

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.532
- How you been?
- Good.

01:21:49.604 --> 01:21:52.095
I haven't heard any of your long
sorry messages in a while.

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:55.074
Those were delightful, weren't they?
Sorry about that.

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:57.043
- April here?
- No, she's at school.

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:59.080
- School?
- Yeah.

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:03.140
- She started grad school at NYU.
- Great. Wow.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:06.312
- If you want to wait, she'll be home soon.
- I'd love to.

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:10.222
Make yourself comfortable.
I have to finish this application I'm writing.

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:12.089
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:37.142
Hey.

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.083
How you doing?

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:41.949
Kevin.

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:45.323
Will Hayes.

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:49.158
I'm just waiting for April.

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.657
Are you the same Kevin
that she mentioned a while back?

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:57.634
I hope so. Unless she's collecting Kevins.

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:59.833
Kevin, phone!

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:03.901
Anyway, I'm pretty sure I am the only Kevin
who's actually living with her.

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:45.075
Do you know what you want yet?

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.785
- No.
- No?

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:55.122
Will?

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:57.360
William Hayes?

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:59.332
God.

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:01.198
- It is!
- Summer.

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.733
You look beautiful.

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:07.736
Believe it or not,
I've been meaning to call you.

01:24:09.344 --> 01:24:11.938
- I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:13.571
- Really?
- Can you believe it?

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:16.014
- Please, sit. Congratulations.
- Thanks. Thanks.

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:17.244
Who's the lucky guy?

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:19.047
- Sam Knowles.
- Okay.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.179
But he's basically out of the picture.

01:24:21.256 --> 01:24:23.281
- He didn't make the cut, huh?
- Yeah.

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:28.591
Well, I don't need a guy. I never really did.

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:30.961
You were about the closest I ever got.

01:24:31.032 --> 01:24:35.128
No, really, when I was with you,
I thought, "This is it."

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:36.500
But I screwed it up.

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:39.404
- No, you didn't.
- I did. I so did.

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:41.498
Listen,

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:45.512
I'm having a little party Sunday.

01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:48.441
- I want you to come.
- Oh, boy.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:50.813
4:00. No excuses.

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:55.754
Will you come? Please?

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.815
You know, I'll see if I can make it.

01:24:57.892 --> 01:25:00.622
- I really want you to.
- I'll make it.

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:03.129
I want to make amends
with anyone I ever hurt.

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:06.690
And I figure it'll take about nine months,

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:08.599
which is perfect timing.

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:12.296
- And she's off. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:16.039
William Hayes.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:19.171
- Dad, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
- What?

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:23.013
Telling me this story,
this mystery love story.

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:27.686
- What if I don't like who my mom is?
- Of course you'll like who your mom is.

01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:30.383
And you don't have to wait long to find out,
because that very night...

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:33.359
It's Summer, isn't it?
And you're not my father.

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:35.191
No wonder you didn't want to be with her.

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:38.596
Take it easy, Maya. It's just a story.

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:42.764
And this one has a happy ending.

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:45.203
How does it have a happy ending?

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:49.676
You and my mom, whoever she is,
you're getting divorced.

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.977
What's the happy in that?

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:59.386
Okay, you know what?
I think we should stop now.

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:00.785
No!

01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:05.784
Then how about a nice cup of tea?

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:09.694
If you want, I'll still continue with the story.
Does that sound good?

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.732
- Maya?
- Okay.

01:26:18.139 --> 01:26:19.629
Dad?

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:26.573
I can't believe you smoked
and drank and were such a slut.

01:26:29.584 --> 01:26:31.415
But I still love you.

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:35.980
Thanks.

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:38.280
All right. All right.

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:41.413
No, no. Don't eat it yet!
Not till we get to our bench.

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:43.780
You're in a good mood.

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:47.851
Well, I think I discovered
who my mom is in the story.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.954
- Really?
- Really.

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:53.162
- Well, who is it?
- Not telling.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:57.234
So the last time we saw William Hayes,

01:27:57.305 --> 01:28:00.866
he had just discovered that
the woman he truly loved, April Hoffman,

01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:02.067
was in love with another man.

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:05.371
I know. Shocking.

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:08.372
<i>Meanwhile, he accepted an invitation</i>

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:11.441
<i>to the home of his ex-girlfriend,
Summer Hartley,</i>

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:15.478
<i>who, if she does turn out to be my mother,
I'm running away to Canada.</i>

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:17.217
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:27.366
- He died last year.
- Yeah.

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:30.063
<i>- You heard?
- I read about it in The Times.</i>

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.662
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:28:31.906 --> 01:28:34.340
- God. Died in his office. Heart attack?
- Yeah.

01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:38.470
I always imagined
that he'd make a more theatrical exit.

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:42.038
What they didn't say was he was
on the couch with the dean's daughter.

01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:43.947
- Jesus.
- I'm kidding.

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:50.324
Actually, he was completely alone and
it was hours before the janitor found him.

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:53.886
- You want a drink?
- I'm sorry.

01:28:53.961 --> 01:28:56.691
- You must miss him.
- I do, yeah.

01:28:57.598 --> 01:28:58.724
These are for you.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.234
- Oh, Will.
- Yeah.

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:05.202
They're beautiful.

01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:08.707
So are you.

01:29:10.912 --> 01:29:12.880
- Summer.
- Will.

01:29:12.947 --> 01:29:14.710
Don't mess with me.

01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:16.113
I can see where you're going with this.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:19.176
In a second, you're gonna
say something impossibly charming.

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:21.187
- Really?
- Yeah. It's gonna be great.

01:29:21.255 --> 01:29:24.418
And then you're gonna sweep me off my feet
and we all know where that's going.

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:26.756
- Can't a girl miss a guy?
- And you know that's gonna end badly.

01:29:26.828 --> 01:29:28.090
Yeah, she can,

01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:31.390
but I just don't really have time for the pain.

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:35.425
- So let's just skip all that, why don't we?
- Okay.

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:37.668
Fair enough.

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:39.904
Can we be friends?

01:29:39.974 --> 01:29:41.965
- Yeah! Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:44.671
- Shake on it? Okay.
- Let's do that. All right.

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:49.377
You know what?

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:54.086
There's someone here I want you to meet.

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:57.680
Yeah. Come with me.

01:29:57.759 --> 01:29:59.056
They're an old flame of mine,

01:29:59.127 --> 01:30:03.359
and I think you guys are really gonna,
you know, hit it off.

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:08.361
Emily.

01:30:11.038 --> 01:30:13.165
I'm gonna put these in some water.

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:17.842
- You look...
- You look...

01:30:19.847 --> 01:30:21.144
You look great.

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:25.680
- Why are you in New York?
- I live here.

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:29.211
I took a job
with the city education department.

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:31.758
- I called you.
- I know.

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:34.351
- I've been meaning to call you back.
- Liar.

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:36.857
- I had lost your number.
- Of course.

01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:39.365
- No, it's true. You know what?
- Will...

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:41.299
Okay, give me your number, right now.

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:45.328
I'm gonna put it in my cell phone,
and that way I'm never gonna lose it, okay?

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:52.210
My number is 212-664-7665.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:55.306
Six, six, five. See? Now I got it.
And I'm never gonna lose it again.

01:30:58.319 --> 01:31:00.480
- Oh, no, go ahead, go ahead.
- Sorry.

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:02.216
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Will.

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:06.121
I'm really sorry I lost your number.

01:31:07.361 --> 01:31:11.058
I just had the weirdest flash
of a whole life,

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:13.464
one that never, ever happened.

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:18.462
What did happen to us?

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:20.530
- You slept with my roommate.
- Oh!

01:31:21.742 --> 01:31:23.073
I'm sorry.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:25.908
If I remember correctly,
I believe it was my "plan," wasn't it?

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:27.743
- The plan. Remember that?
- Yes, the plan.

01:31:27.815 --> 01:31:28.907
Who talks like that?

01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:34.285
No, it wasn't the plan.
I was scared of you and your dreams,

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:38.782
and then after we broke up, I just felt lost.

01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:44.864
I still feel pretty lost,
especially when it comes to relationships.

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.193
Yeah.

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:50.693
Yeah, I've been... Me, too.

01:31:57.111 --> 01:31:59.841
Did you ever think

01:32:00.481 --> 01:32:03.917
that maybe we just needed a different plan?

01:32:04.886 --> 01:32:07.821
<i>Wait! Stop! Stop right there.
Now, go back.</i>

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:11.753
<i>Okay, stop. Now go forward, slowly.</i>

01:32:12.593 --> 01:32:14.117
<i>Now here it comes.</i>

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:15.822
<i>There! Right there!</i>

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:18.560
That's it! That's how I figured it out!

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:20.396
That's what Mom does when I'm upset.

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:23.062
<i>She fluffs up my hair
and tells me to be brilliant</i>

01:32:23.137 --> 01:32:26.072
or shine like the sun,
and it always makes me feel better.

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.404
- Sounds like a great mom.
- She is a great mom.

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:34.972
So you're absolutely positive,
100%, that Emily is the very same woman

01:32:35.349 --> 01:32:37.544
walking toward us right now?

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:40.386
Absolutely.

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:42.016
Is it?

01:32:44.058 --> 01:32:46.322
- Mom! Mom!
- Hey!

01:32:49.997 --> 01:32:51.487
I'm so glad it's you.

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:54.126
- Well, who else would it be?
- Nobody.

01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:57.401
- Good morning, Will.
- Hey, Sarah.

01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:00.874
Mom, can Dad come with us to the zoo?

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:03.103
Yeah, if Dad wants to come, sure.

01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:07.578
You know, I love the zoo.
Let's go to the zoo.

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:10.682
- Guess what, Mom?
- What?

01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:13.447
We learned all about sexual intercourse
at school yesterday.

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:15.352
- Really?
- Really.

01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:16.581
Really.

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:30.226
I love penguins.

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:32.467
Me, too.

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:33.700
Me, three.

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:46.849
Did you know that penguins mate for life?

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:49.014
Although, Mr. Monell told us

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:51.490
that sometimes the husband
and wife penguins get separated

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:53.220
'cause of their migraine patterns.

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:54.625
- Migratory.
- Migratory.

01:33:55.363 --> 01:33:59.925
Well, sometimes they're apart for years,
but they almost always find each other.

01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:05.999
Do you know
what the husband and wife penguins do

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:08.803
after they find each other after all that time?

01:34:10.011 --> 01:34:11.740
Throw back their heads,

01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:15.043
flap their flippers
and sing as loud as they can!

01:35:00.661 --> 01:35:03.494
Okay. All right, munchkin. Let's go!

01:35:07.568 --> 01:35:11.163
Hey, monster, that was fun today.
I'll see you on Wednesday, okay?

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:16.734
See you later.

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:21.078
Dad!

01:35:27.988 --> 01:35:31.116
- Thanks for telling me the story.
- You're welcome.

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:36.686
- I forgot to tell you the happy ending.
- What is it?

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:39.229
You.

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:52.170
- Hey, I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:55.272
Go catch up to your mom, okay?
All right, bye.

01:35:57.518 --> 01:35:58.746
Are you all right?

01:35:58.819 --> 01:35:59.979
Yeah?

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:20.940
Mr. President! Hey, Mr. President!

01:36:21.008 --> 01:36:24.000
Will Hayes, I worked on the '92 campaign.

01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:54.665
Hi. I'm looking for April.

01:38:04.745 --> 01:38:07.179
Check that they have
legal representation, okay?

01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:08.806
- Right.
- Thanks, John.

01:38:17.358 --> 01:38:18.416
I can't believe you're doing this.

01:38:18.492 --> 01:38:19.618
- This is great.
- Thanks.

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:21.058
- Still smoking?
- I quit.

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:24.723
- Me, too. Still live in the same loft?
- Living in Brooklyn.

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.698
Always on the cutting edge.

01:38:26.767 --> 01:38:29.668
- Dating?
- Not at present. You?

01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:32.665
- I got divorced.
- I know.

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.605
I heard. I'm so sorry.

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:36.302
Why?

01:38:36.377 --> 01:38:38.072
You always said marriage was overrated.

01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:41.410
Yeah, and you never listened to me.
You were always with the rings.

01:38:41.482 --> 01:38:44.781
- Is that why you and Kevin never...
- Oh, God, Kevin. No. Kevin...

01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:47.684
Something always seemed
to be missing with Kevin.

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:49.746
I don't know.

01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:54.260
It's weird. It was never quite right.
You know?

01:38:54.328 --> 01:38:55.488
Yeah.

01:38:56.730 --> 01:38:59.460
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

01:39:02.636 --> 01:39:04.695
I have something for you.

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:48.645
Thank you so much.

01:39:49.984 --> 01:39:52.851
How did you find it?
I mean, where did you find it?

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:57.183
That's the difficult part to explain.

01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:01.221
This is gonna sound bad.

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:04.421
I've had it for a while.

01:40:05.399 --> 01:40:06.730
How long?

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:08.999
Years.

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:11.494
Many years.

01:40:12.373 --> 01:40:14.307
I meant to...

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.434
I meant to give it to you.
I wanted to give it to you.

01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:18.068
I just...

01:40:18.512 --> 01:40:21.481
I couldn't. And I don't know why.

01:40:22.816 --> 01:40:26.843
I dropped it off once. I mean, I tried.
Kevin was there and...

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.549
Hey, there is no excuse, and I'm sorry.

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:33.587
It's inexcusable.

01:40:37.898 --> 01:40:40.594
- I think you should go, Will.
- April?

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:43.669
I think you should go.

01:40:57.985 --> 01:41:01.284
You never gave it to her? After all that time?

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:03.289
I know. I know.
- But it was from her dad.

01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:05.587
I know. I know.

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:07.593
And then you just left?

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:10.026
Yep.

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:14.729
How come you changed all the names
except hers?

01:41:14.802 --> 01:41:15.928
What do you mean?

01:41:16.003 --> 01:41:18.870
In the story, you know,
like Mom became Emily,

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:22.670
and Summer's that Natasha lady
who writes for that magazine.

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:25.507
But you didn't change April's name. Why?

01:41:28.449 --> 01:41:32.545
Why are you so concerned
with all of this anyway?

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:35.085
Because I want you to be happy.

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:36.720
You know,

01:41:37.791 --> 01:41:39.452
I'm happy.

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:42.952
Trust me, Dad. You're not happy.

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:58.438
Put your coat on.

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:05.274
- Taxi!
- Taxi!

01:42:12.092 --> 01:42:13.889
She said something was missing
with Kevin,

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:16.589
which means
it might not be missing with you,

01:42:16.663 --> 01:42:19.427
- which is good news, right?
- Could be.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:21.697
Could be.

01:42:23.203 --> 01:42:27.037
Did you know that 35 people try
to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge each year?

01:42:27.107 --> 01:42:29.337
Most because of broken hearts.

01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:31.871
I'll keep that in mind.

01:42:49.863 --> 01:42:52.889
<i>Hello.
- Hey. Hi.</i>

01:42:53.066 --> 01:42:54.055
<i>It's me, Will.</i>

01:42:56.503 --> 01:42:57.697
April?

01:43:03.977 --> 01:43:05.808
What are you doing here?

01:43:07.181 --> 01:43:08.205
<i>Uh...</i>

01:43:08.282 --> 01:43:10.045
<i>Go on, tell her.</i>

01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:12.575
Who's that?

01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:15.747
That would be my daughter, Maya.

01:43:15.822 --> 01:43:18.120
That's kind of cheating, isn't it?
Bringing your daughter?

01:43:18.192 --> 01:43:20.092
What am I supposed to do now?

01:43:21.461 --> 01:43:23.452
Well, you could let us in.

01:43:26.366 --> 01:43:29.028
I don't think she's gonna let us in.

01:43:30.971 --> 01:43:32.495
I think you're wrong.

01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:35.241
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

01:43:35.309 --> 01:43:38.676
A little while longer.
She's going to let us in.

01:43:38.745 --> 01:43:40.975
Okay, kiddo, here's the deal.

01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:43.141
I'm gonna count to 30, okay?

01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:45.208
And if she doesn't let us in,
we're gonna go home,

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:47.219
and we're never gonna talk about this again.

01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:49.448
- Deal?
- Yeah.

01:43:50.057 --> 01:43:51.183
Ready?

01:43:51.825 --> 01:43:56.285
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

01:43:56.363 --> 01:44:00.493
<i>...four, five, six...
...four, five, six...</i>

01:44:01.468 --> 01:44:06.565
...14, 15, 16, 17...
...14, 15, 16, 17...

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:09.632
If she lets us in,
tell her the story like you told me.

01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:11.974
<i>- And then she'll know.
- Know what?</i>

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:14.070
<i>I can't explain. She'll just know.</i>

01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:19.976
...25, 26, 27...
...25, 26, 27...

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:24.051
- Twenty-nine.
- Twenty-nine.

01:44:26.126 --> 01:44:28.822
Twenty-nine and a quarter.

01:44:28.895 --> 01:44:31.363
Twenty-nine and a half.

01:44:33.133 --> 01:44:35.465
Twenty-nine and three-quarters.

01:44:36.903 --> 01:44:38.768
What comes after that?

01:44:41.141 --> 01:44:42.540
Time to go.

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:47.812
But this wasn't
what was supposed to have happened.

01:44:47.881 --> 01:44:49.178
- I know.
- I really thought

01:44:49.249 --> 01:44:53.208
she would have heard through the intercom
and let us in,

01:44:53.287 --> 01:44:54.845
or run down the stairs and say...

01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:56.320
What story?

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:01.526
What story?

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:15.808
- I kept the book...
- Yeah?

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:20.838
...because it was the only thing
that I had left of you.

01:45:41.601 --> 01:45:45.560
- You must be Maya.
- You must be April.

01:45:50.143 --> 01:45:52.236
So what happens now?

01:45:52.312 --> 01:45:55.577
You invite us inside,
and we tell you the story.

01:45:56.683 --> 01:45:58.007
Okay.
