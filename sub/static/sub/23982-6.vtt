WEBVTT

00:04.964 --> 00:08.218
Oh, Carly, God, I cannot believe
that I'm finally meeting you.

00:08.343 --> 00:10.762
- What are you, 16?
- 17, uh...

00:10.970 --> 00:12.847
- in two months.
- Everybody must tell you

00:12.889 --> 00:14.349
you look just like your mum.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.060
- Sometimes, yeah.
- And Taylor, too.

00:17.519 --> 00:18.561
Around the eyes.

00:19.771 --> 00:22.398
Last time I saw Julia, you were,
what, 10, 11?

00:23.441 --> 00:26.903
You were all dressed up
in your mum's high heels.

00:27.111 --> 00:30.490
Yeah, you had a red hat
with a pom-pom on top

00:30.573 --> 00:33.368
and you were... you were
singing into a kitchen spoon.

00:33.409 --> 00:36.871
- Oh, God.
- Right, Pete? Do you remember?

00:37.455 --> 00:39.832
Uh, what, you were dancing around to, uh...

00:40.583 --> 00:42.794
- Madonna.
- That'd be, uh, Mariah Carey...

00:42.835 --> 00:44.462
- Right!
- Actually, mm-hmm.

00:44.546 --> 00:47.298
Yeah, oh, I think your dad, uh...
has a video of that.

00:47.340 --> 00:50.051
- He made a video.
- I have to see that.

00:50.301 --> 00:51.386
Over my dead body.

00:51.553 --> 00:54.222
And Taylor, you were always playing hockey.

00:54.556 --> 00:57.892
You were gonna get out of Bridgeport,
be a big NHL star.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.854
Yeah, well, we all grow up, right?

01:02.397 --> 01:06.693
I... I never would've guessed
that you'd end up a cop.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.571
But I guess, I dunno.

01:09.612 --> 01:11.406
Makes sense.
You were always kind of a bully.

01:17.036 --> 01:19.247
What? I'm just telling the truth.

01:19.539 --> 01:21.374
Yeah, well, that was a long time ago, Mum.

01:21.624 --> 01:22.750
Twenty years.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.003
- Mm-hmm.
- You mind me asking, um...

01:26.004 --> 01:26.921
what brings you back?

01:28.047 --> 01:29.882
Pete, actually.

01:30.300 --> 01:34.178
I mean, I thought about coming back
for years.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.682
But, uh, then I always found
a reason not to.

01:38.182 --> 01:39.601
Then Pete called, and...

01:41.394 --> 01:45.315
he told me that he'd been here
and, uh, seen you all.

01:45.523 --> 01:46.482
And he...

01:47.233 --> 01:48.943
he told me about Dad's stroke.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.155
And I knew it was time.

01:55.366 --> 01:56.242
So...

01:57.243 --> 01:58.119
here I am.

02:01.664 --> 02:03.166
- Here we all are.
- Yeah.

02:32.362 --> 02:33.655
<i>This kindly grandmother</i>

02:33.738 --> 02:35.698
<i>was out for a day
of shopping at the mall...</i>

02:36.157 --> 02:37.575
Come in, come in.

02:43.498 --> 02:47.126
This is... this is just for... for $10.

02:47.585 --> 02:48.836
Like, uh...

02:48.961 --> 02:54.092
imagine what they would do
for 11 million!

02:58.888 --> 03:00.098
Oh...

03:01.182 --> 03:02.058
Hey.

03:04.060 --> 03:06.437
Speaking of $11 million

03:09.565 --> 03:13.611
where the fuck is my $11 million?

03:15.405 --> 03:16.280
What?

03:17.031 --> 03:18.074
Do you see something?

03:19.325 --> 03:20.201
It's your aura.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.870
There's a deep curiosity in you.

03:23.913 --> 03:24.956
You're very intuitive

03:25.498 --> 03:29.335
but it's been hard losing your parents
at such a young age.

03:29.961 --> 03:31.254
I... I don't know.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.965
Oh, no, I don't...
I don't mean... I'm sorry.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.967
I don't mean to make
you feel uncomfortable.

03:36.467 --> 03:40.555
It's just, uh, when someone loses
someone important to them

03:41.055 --> 03:42.598
there's a trauma to the spirit.

03:43.725 --> 03:45.560
- This is what you do for a living?
- What?

03:46.018 --> 03:47.103
You're a... a psychic?

03:47.979 --> 03:49.564
I'm a spiritualist, actually.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.525
And what's the difference?

03:52.650 --> 03:53.985
I read people.

03:54.152 --> 03:56.362
I help them with their problems, and I...

03:57.155 --> 03:59.907
I connect them with people who've passed.

03:59.949 --> 04:01.325
Taylor?

04:01.826 --> 04:03.077
- Oh, shit.
- Grandpa.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.454
Taylor, are you alright?

04:05.204 --> 04:06.873
Your text sounded kinda urgent.

04:17.008 --> 04:18.092
Maggie.

04:19.677 --> 04:20.553
Hi.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.514
Maggie.

04:27.143 --> 04:28.019
You're here.

04:28.478 --> 04:30.354
Better late than never, right?

04:30.855 --> 04:32.273
Aw, Daddy.

04:39.030 --> 04:40.031
Are you OK?

04:40.740 --> 04:42.408
I am fine!

04:42.784 --> 04:43.659
I'm fine!

04:43.701 --> 04:46.412
Oh, I...

04:47.205 --> 04:48.122
Hey!

04:48.873 --> 04:50.958
Pete! You're back.

04:51.042 --> 04:52.919
You're here!
Come, come, come, get over here.

04:53.711 --> 04:54.879
Get over here!

04:55.588 --> 04:56.714
You!

05:01.052 --> 05:02.553
This is bloom pour.

05:03.638 --> 05:06.390
Slow, steady circles, take time.

05:07.558 --> 05:10.812
The coffee, fine grind, less bitter.

05:12.021 --> 05:13.272
Rich colour...

05:13.606 --> 05:15.274
nice viscosity.

05:15.817 --> 05:16.776
It's a good bean.

05:17.527 --> 05:18.528
A good bean.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.655
Yes.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.324
A man who appreciates coffee.

05:23.783 --> 05:26.619
Yeah, you spend as much time in a car
as I do, you know?

05:26.702 --> 05:27.995
You like a good cup of coffee.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.288
Ah, it's fine.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.415
I don't know if you need
all this hipster bullshit.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.292
Fuck hipsters!

05:34.335 --> 05:37.129
I've been doing this shit 30 years.

05:37.547 --> 05:39.799
I'm just saying,
give me a cup of Dunkin' Donuts.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.718
How about I give you cup of hot piss?

05:43.386 --> 05:44.262
Huh?

05:44.804 --> 05:47.223
Take lesson from friend.

05:47.765 --> 05:48.724
He has taste.

05:51.978 --> 05:52.979
Now...

05:55.565 --> 05:56.607
You have mother...

05:57.650 --> 05:58.985
then you lost mother.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.196
You have son...

06:02.864 --> 06:04.365
then you lost son.

06:06.158 --> 06:08.202
These two, they are resourceful, no?

06:09.287 --> 06:11.122
- We'll get 'em.
- That we will.

06:11.956 --> 06:13.583
My father was fisherman.

06:15.918 --> 06:19.213
Very simple life, but he teach me

06:19.589 --> 06:22.675
everything I need to know about business.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.804
In springtime

06:27.722 --> 06:29.056
he fish for squid

06:30.016 --> 06:32.894
in bay of my town, Herceg Novi.

06:35.479 --> 06:38.107
Most men fish during daytime.

06:38.816 --> 06:39.775
Easy.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.737
But my father, very smart man.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.074
He fish for squid at night.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.870
More difficult, more dangerous

06:52.496 --> 06:57.793
but he knows
that if he shine light into water

06:59.795 --> 07:02.465
the squid, they cannot help themselves.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.008
They must come.

07:04.717 --> 07:05.760
Curious.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.347
He get big catch every time.

07:09.513 --> 07:10.890
Much profit, so...

07:22.193 --> 07:23.194
Go to farm

07:24.153 --> 07:27.239
tie Grandma and Grandpa to chair

07:29.659 --> 07:33.746
and burn fucking house down
to foundation.

07:37.083 --> 07:41.337
Light from fire
will draw Maggie and Pete to us.

Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

08:27.091 --> 08:28.217
Oh, hey. You guys!

08:28.300 --> 08:30.302
- You gotta look at these great pictures.
- No, I think...

08:30.886 --> 08:31.929
Oh, my God.

08:33.848 --> 08:35.307
Alright, this is a bit of a mind-fuck.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.059
You have no idea. How's the, um...

08:37.143 --> 08:39.895
- the um, laundry service coming?
- Oh, great, great.

08:39.979 --> 08:42.398
Yeah, Dockery was so happy,
he gave me more laundry.

08:43.024 --> 08:45.484
- A lot more.
- Shit.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.154
- Grandpa, is that you?
- Look at this one.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.989
Oh, my God.
Look at Mum's hair!

08:50.197 --> 08:51.407
It looks like a wig!

08:51.699 --> 08:53.743
- I gave her that perm.
- What?

08:54.076 --> 08:56.912
- On purpose?
- No, I didn't say that I was good at it.

08:57.121 --> 08:59.248
- Look at you.
- Oh, no, no, look at this.

08:59.457 --> 09:00.791
Look at... there's Pete

09:01.083 --> 09:04.003
there's Taylor, and there is Julia.

09:04.420 --> 09:05.671
Pete, Pete.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.298
Do you remember that day?

09:08.340 --> 09:11.594
What? That was in the, uh, the cockpit.

09:11.677 --> 09:14.346
Those matching tracksuits,
I thought we were so cool.

09:14.555 --> 09:17.850
And then, um... Taylor threw up on me
as soon as the plane took off.

09:17.892 --> 09:19.935
- It was the milkshake.
- It was disgusting.

09:20.478 --> 09:22.146
Pete, you look really different.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.356
Yeah, well, he grew up.

09:24.774 --> 09:27.068
Ma, is that is that you
when you were, uh...

09:27.443 --> 09:29.653
Uh, yeah, that's me and Jason Burrows.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.238
- Oh, yeah?
- At the prom.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.907
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow!

09:33.199 --> 09:35.701
Grandpa, how come
you never showed us these before?

09:35.785 --> 09:37.661
Uh, forgot, I guess.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.663
I... hey, um...

09:40.623 --> 09:42.083
Let... let's have dinner.

09:42.208 --> 09:44.794
Let's have a big family dinner.
I'm gonna call Audrey.

09:45.336 --> 09:49.006
Is that a good idea? Maybe, I mean,
maybe she should ease into it.

09:49.090 --> 09:52.009
Oh, no, no, no.
We are going to celebrate.

09:55.513 --> 09:56.388
Hey.

09:56.889 --> 09:57.848
Hey, it's me.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.726
<i>Look, um, I'm gonna make
a big dinner tonight.</i>

10:00.851 --> 10:02.686
Tonight? I'm exhausted.

10:03.479 --> 10:05.147
Well, I've already invited everybody.

10:05.481 --> 10:08.109
- Who's everybody?
- The family.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.402
<i>So un-invite them.</i>

10:10.736 --> 10:12.154
Well, I can't.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.616
- Why?
- Look, look, I'm gonna do all the cooking.

10:15.699 --> 10:18.661
You don't have to do...
Just call it a day and come home, OK?

10:19.495 --> 10:20.579
Otto, what's this about?

10:20.830 --> 10:22.915
Well, you'll find out when you get here.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.501
Hey, Dad, it's OK.
Maybe another time.

10:27.545 --> 10:28.462
Oh, my God.

10:28.879 --> 10:29.755
<i>Is that...?</i>

10:30.673 --> 10:31.549
Yes.

10:37.388 --> 10:38.681
When were you gonna tell me?

10:39.056 --> 10:42.935
Look, all the kids are here
and we're looking at old photos.

10:43.519 --> 10:46.313
Huh? Just call it a day and come home.

10:47.565 --> 10:48.774
I've got too much work.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.819
Audrey, it can wait. Please, just--

10:59.994 --> 11:03.372
Look, ever since my stroke,
your mum's been doing double duty.

11:03.956 --> 11:06.959
- She'll be here.
- Grandpa, I gotta go do some work stuff

11:07.001 --> 11:08.752
- but I'll grab booze.
- OK.

11:09.253 --> 11:11.380
I'm gonna pick up the kids
and I'll get dessert.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.549
OK. Do it, do it.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.759
- Don't be late!
- Hey, Mum, you know, I'm thinking

11:15.885 --> 11:18.137
this is probably really hard for Grandma.

11:18.220 --> 11:21.557
Maybe you should go to the office
and see her one-on-one, right?

11:21.599 --> 11:22.725
- I can drive you.
- Mags?

11:22.766 --> 11:25.060
I'll go, but... but by myself.

11:25.227 --> 11:28.272
You, you stay here and, uh,
help your grandfather with dinner.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.441
Mum, I'm getting the idea
you don't wanna talk to me.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.151
Hey, come on.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.360
- Come on.
- OK.

11:33.444 --> 11:36.864
Go with Maggie.
You need to spend time together, you know?

11:42.411 --> 11:44.580
Do you mind telling me
what the fuck's going on?

11:44.663 --> 11:47.082
Easy, my dad is watching us.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.668
Bye, Dad!

11:51.503 --> 11:54.298
Why would you leave me to die in Rosedale?

11:54.465 --> 11:56.217
Hm? Well, I think the bigger question

11:56.508 --> 11:59.011
is why are you pretending to be my son?

12:01.347 --> 12:02.932
Pete and I were cellmates.

12:03.015 --> 12:05.309
He would talk a lot about his family,
his childhood

12:05.351 --> 12:07.061
and how he hadn't been here in 20 years.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.065
So, when I got out,
I needed a place to hide.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.734
Why is not important.
I became Pete.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.570
- How's that working out for you?
- It's fucking great

12:16.612 --> 12:17.488
- that's how.
- Uh-huh.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.240
- You know what? I'm still alive, right?
- Yeah, OK.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.866
I'm sorry about Rosedale, alright?

12:20.991 --> 12:23.452
But you came there with all kinds
of conflicting energy.

12:23.661 --> 12:24.912
- No.
- Yes. I didn't know

12:24.995 --> 12:27.790
whether you were a friend
or an enemy or both.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.500
So I ran. I ran.

12:29.959 --> 12:31.585
But then I talked to Pete, though.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.087
And he told me...

12:33.754 --> 12:35.172
He told me about you, he said

12:35.214 --> 12:37.508
that you had saved him
and that I could trust you.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.593
But I didn't know that in Rosedale.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.136
And I still don't know that now.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.639
- Where the fuck is Pete?
- He's safe.

12:44.265 --> 12:45.808
What, on some Indian reservation?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.686
If you knew that, why do you ask me?

12:48.727 --> 12:50.437
Because I'm just trying to figure out
your fucking game.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.022
Game, I'll give you game.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.694
- Yeah, you want me to be the target.
- Target?

12:58.612 --> 13:00.030
They'll think that Pete's dead

13:00.489 --> 13:01.865
- and then he's safe, right?
- Safe?

13:01.907 --> 13:03.284
- Yeah.
- I want everyone to be safe.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.201
Oh, bullshit.

13:04.285 --> 13:06.954
I have had enough blood on my hands.
I don't want any more.

13:16.297 --> 13:18.966
<i>What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?</i>

13:19.008 --> 13:21.176
<i>I'll teach you to say that
in Siamese if you like.</i>

13:21.385 --> 13:22.386
Shannon?

13:25.556 --> 13:27.099
- Shannon?
- Shh!

13:27.141 --> 13:29.184
<i>I don't know, sir,
it's taken an awful beating.</i>

13:29.518 --> 13:32.354
<i>- I can't seem to get a strong signal.
- I'll tell you what's wrong with it.</i>

13:32.438 --> 13:36.108
<i>It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten,
like everything else in this rotten jungle.</i>

13:36.734 --> 13:37.985
<i>Might as well dump it.</i>

13:38.569 --> 13:40.571
- Hey, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

13:43.741 --> 13:45.451
Mm...

13:48.162 --> 13:51.165
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

13:51.415 --> 13:52.458
You better shut up.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.251
Shh, shh, hey, listen.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.338
Came from some crazy shit with my family,
I thought you were really in trouble.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.214
What?

14:00.591 --> 14:01.508
I am.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.387
In my head, I... I figured I could

14:05.929 --> 14:09.058
manage to keep everything
in its little box, but...

14:11.435 --> 14:12.770
Sean is getting touchy

14:13.395 --> 14:16.190
and I'm running out of excuses.
I... I don't...

14:17.608 --> 14:19.693
I'm not sure if I
can keep doing this.

14:20.778 --> 14:21.862
You don't have to.

14:23.572 --> 14:24.448
Leave him.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.743
We can figure this out. It's not...

14:28.494 --> 14:29.536
Hey.

14:29.745 --> 14:32.289
You've gotta be quiet,
or I'm gonna ask you to leave.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.209
<i>Oh, by all means.</i>

14:35.542 --> 14:39.129
<i>Good hunting, good show, jolly good fun.
Jolly, jolly good.</i>

14:41.673 --> 14:42.591
Seriously?

14:42.716 --> 14:43.592
Yeah.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.681
Otto looks so old.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.726
You know, when I left, he was a bear
and now he's an old man.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.520
Yeah, time is relentless.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.731
- But can we get to the more pressing issue?
- I wanted to go home

14:57.773 --> 14:59.149
when I heard he had a stroke.

14:59.441 --> 15:03.112
But those guys were following me.
I didn't want to lead them back to my family.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.322
You ever go home?

15:05.989 --> 15:07.449
This is not that kind of conversation.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.953
Well, I mean, it's not a stretch to imagine
that a con man might've had

15:10.994 --> 15:13.080
- a less-than-perfect childhood.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

15:13.122 --> 15:14.248
We don't have time for this.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.084
You have to tell me what happened
at that storage facility.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.129
- I don't wanna talk about what happened.
- I don't think you really have a choice

15:20.170 --> 15:21.797
unless you want your whole family dead.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.595
Look, I... I can't help you
unless you tell me what happened.

15:31.473 --> 15:34.518
You know, I worked with a crew
run by my boyfriend Reggie.

15:36.854 --> 15:37.980
We were good.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.275
Fifteen minutes, in and out.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.110
Hit as many lockers as we could.

15:43.861 --> 15:45.154
But then three years ago...

15:45.779 --> 15:47.614
<i>we hit a place in Mount Vernon.</i>

15:48.699 --> 15:52.327
<i>While Pete followed the security guard
to lunch, we went inside.</i>

15:55.038 --> 15:56.707
<i>We killed the security cameras.</i>

15:58.459 --> 16:03.464
<i>We found some cash and a key taped
to the bottom of a drawer for locker 237.</i>

16:05.090 --> 16:06.550
<i>It seemed maybe important.</i>

16:06.884 --> 16:11.096
<i>So, while the rest of us popped locks,
Reggie checked out 237.</i>

16:14.600 --> 16:17.227
<i>It was full of the usual
sad, forgotten junk.</i>

16:20.481 --> 16:24.026
<i>Reggie was about to leave
when he saw some boxes at the back.</i>

16:26.236 --> 16:29.198
<i>He couldn't tell me what it was
that drew him to the boxes</i>

16:32.701 --> 16:34.870
<i>or what made him look past the
magazines.</i>

16:36.121 --> 16:38.081
<i>He showed us what was inside.</i>

16:40.167 --> 16:41.543
There's nine more just like this one.

16:42.085 --> 16:45.172
<i>That much cash hidden in a
locker set off alarms for me.</i>

16:46.590 --> 16:48.592
<i>But I sensed something more about the money</i>

16:49.051 --> 16:52.721
<i>that it had a bad past
and an even worse future.</i>

16:52.888 --> 16:54.181
Pete's gonna have to step up.

16:54.223 --> 16:55.891
- This is bad. I...
- No, this is our money.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.976
This is what we've been working for.

17:00.729 --> 17:01.939
<i>So I called Pete.</i>

17:02.898 --> 17:05.025
<i>Told him to do whatever it took</i>

17:05.067 --> 17:06.068
<i>to delay the guard</i>

17:06.527 --> 17:08.946
<i>to buy us time to get all of the money
out of the building.</i>

17:09.238 --> 17:10.572
Nobody move!

17:10.989 --> 17:13.700
<i>- He tried, but...</i>
- Where the fuck is he?

17:14.952 --> 17:18.372
<i>I'm guessing he told you that guard
had already gone back to work.</i>

17:20.082 --> 17:21.083
I'm so sorry, here...

17:21.542 --> 17:22.417
It's OK.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.063
Maggie! Check him!

17:44.982 --> 17:46.567
- You're shot.
- I'm fine. Check him!

17:47.276 --> 17:48.151
Check him!

17:52.823 --> 17:53.782
Let's go!

17:53.824 --> 17:55.951
<i>We took the money
and went to the meet-up</i>

17:55.993 --> 17:57.077
<i>but Pete never showed.</i>

17:59.538 --> 18:01.498
<i>Reggie was gonna die
if we didn't do something</i>

18:01.540 --> 18:03.959
<i>so I threw on a wig and got him help.</i>

18:28.984 --> 18:31.820
<i>After I took care of the van,
I returned to the hospital.</i>

18:32.821 --> 18:35.532
<i>But by the time I got back,
there was a man there.</i>

18:38.744 --> 18:40.287
<i>I couldn't take my eyes off him.</i>

18:41.622 --> 18:45.292
<i>He had the darkest aura I'd ever seen,
black as night.</i>

18:49.755 --> 18:50.714
<i>Reggie was dead.</i>

18:53.759 --> 18:56.345
I assume that he told them
where the money was.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.388
I would've. Anybody would've.

18:58.472 --> 19:02.351
I didn't know, I didn't know that he hadn't
until you came to Rosedale.

19:02.434 --> 19:04.936
- So where is it?
- I'm not telling you that.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.104
Not yet.

19:07.522 --> 19:10.817
This man with the black aura...

19:14.154 --> 19:15.322
his name is Luka

19:16.365 --> 19:19.451
- and he's the...
- He's the scariest man in the world. I know.

19:20.494 --> 19:24.498
But, uh, right now I gotta go talk
to someone even scarier.

19:28.710 --> 19:29.586
OK.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.617
I need a drink first.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.415
First you freak out because Luka's pissed.

20:06.665 --> 20:08.583
Now you're freaked out
because he's too calm?

20:09.626 --> 20:10.544
I don't get you.

20:10.711 --> 20:12.462
There's something not right about that guy.

20:13.088 --> 20:16.425
We lose his only connection to the money,
and he pulls that calm shit.

20:17.426 --> 20:19.219
The time to worry is when the drums stop.

20:21.430 --> 20:23.432
He's been looking for that money
for three years.

20:24.433 --> 20:25.559
What'd he have before us?

20:25.767 --> 20:26.643
Nothing.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.603
- Fucking goose egg.
- He still has nothing.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.690
We found the woman and the kid once.
We'll find 'em again.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.735
All you gotta do is keep your head
on your shoulders

20:34.818 --> 20:36.278
and you'll be able to move out to Seattle.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.655
You can grow your beard,
open your fuckin' coffee shop.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.449
Life'll be great.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.454
We were pretty good
till I was about 14 or 15.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.957
And then what happened
is I developed a thing for bad boys.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.960
And I know that's not original,
but it was something to me.

20:52.961 --> 20:56.506
And Audrey tried to keep me out of all
that went with those boys

20:56.548 --> 20:58.008
and for a while, it worked

20:58.049 --> 21:00.010
until Pete's dad.

21:00.177 --> 21:02.387
- So this is all really interesting.
- You don't...

21:02.429 --> 21:03.388
Mm-hmm, yeah, you don't care.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.973
- You wanna know where the money is.
- Yep.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.809
Well, look, I've done a lot of bad things.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.312
I've hurt a lot of people, stealing things

21:10.896 --> 21:11.855
and I'm done with it

21:12.898 --> 21:15.317
which is why I'm giving the money
back to Luka.

21:16.193 --> 21:17.235
You're gonna do what?

21:17.736 --> 21:19.112
I know that you want it.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.363
- No, this isn't--
- But it's...

21:20.405 --> 21:22.032
- This is not about what I want.
- Oh, no?

21:22.282 --> 21:25.410
- No, you don't know who you're dealing with.
- Oh, no, but I do.

21:25.577 --> 21:28.079
- No, you don't.
- I've dealt with a lot of bad people.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.832
"Bad" doesn't begin to
describe these people.

21:31.374 --> 21:34.002
If you give back the money,
they're gonna kill me.

21:34.711 --> 21:37.005
And then he's gonna go after
your whole family

21:37.088 --> 21:38.465
and he's gonna make you watch.

21:38.548 --> 21:39.758
- And then he's gonna kill you.
- No.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.675
- No.
- Yeah.

21:40.759 --> 21:42.427
No, he won't.

21:42.469 --> 21:43.595
- Yeah, he is.
- No.

21:43.637 --> 21:44.763
- I had a vision.
- Yes, he is.

21:44.805 --> 21:46.264
- I had a vision.
- Oh, you had a vision?

21:46.306 --> 21:47.557
- Yeah.
- Let's spend the next half hour

21:47.599 --> 21:49.017
- listening to your vision.
- I had a vision.

21:49.059 --> 21:49.935
Go ahead.

21:50.101 --> 21:53.897
There are many different paths
the future can take.

21:54.731 --> 21:59.611
And I saw one as clear as day.

22:01.571 --> 22:04.366
If we give the money back to Luka, we live.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.035
That's it.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.043
I've reconsidered,
and I'll bail out Valerie

22:15.085 --> 22:16.461
but there are conditions.

22:16.711 --> 22:20.048
She surrenders her passports,
and I have eyes on her the whole weekend.

22:20.465 --> 22:21.466
That won't be necessary.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.802
When you bailed her out six months ago,
she skipped.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.303
- She won't run again.
- You sure?

22:25.512 --> 22:26.638
- I am.
- I'm not.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.056
I'm sitting on her.

22:28.306 --> 22:31.142
Even if she only gets a weekend
on the outside with you by her side

22:31.226 --> 22:32.352
it's better than nothing.

22:32.477 --> 22:34.855
You're spending a lot of money
for one weekend.

22:35.105 --> 22:37.023
I owe her. Valerie was, uh...

22:38.900 --> 22:40.610
cleaning some linens for me

22:40.694 --> 22:44.030
through a chain of yoga studios.
Freaking gold mine.

22:45.574 --> 22:47.325
Anyway, I was feeling some federal heat

22:48.034 --> 22:49.327
needed a sacrificial lamb.

22:49.494 --> 22:51.788
- She volunteered, took the hit.
- Then ran.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.666
She got cold feet.
Nobody wants to go to prison.

22:55.792 --> 22:56.960
What made you change your mind?

22:58.628 --> 23:01.715
$500,320.

23:06.595 --> 23:08.638
That's more than we talked about.
A lot more.

23:08.847 --> 23:09.806
That's the deal.

23:10.432 --> 23:14.603
I bond Valerie,
you launder the cash, all of it.

23:15.937 --> 23:16.813
Whose is it?

23:18.148 --> 23:19.482
Money like that, I gotta know.

23:22.861 --> 23:23.987
Chayton Dockery.

23:24.613 --> 23:27.240
Hmm...

23:28.658 --> 23:29.910
Alright, Little Blondie.

23:31.828 --> 23:33.914
I can work with that. Deal.

23:43.506 --> 23:44.466
Hey, Marius.

23:44.716 --> 23:45.592
Do I know you?

23:46.927 --> 23:49.596
Get in the car, both of you.

23:50.263 --> 23:51.139
What the fuck?

23:56.102 --> 23:57.604
What the fuck is this about?

23:57.687 --> 23:59.064
The fuck you think it's about?

23:59.147 --> 24:02.025
We're here to talk about Delchev,
Luka Delchev.

24:21.419 --> 24:24.631
In 2000, Luka Delchev
got political asylum in America.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.467
A few years back, he blipped
big-time on our radar

24:27.550 --> 24:30.428
running a small but brutal
criminal syndicate in Mount Vernon.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.430
We went after him, got nothing.

24:32.555 --> 24:35.600
Nobody talked.
Either too afraid or too dead.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.143
Then we got a call from Interpol.

24:37.310 --> 24:41.231
Turns out in '98, a UN peacekeeping unit
transporting 15 million in secret cash

24:41.481 --> 24:43.149
was ambushed in the hills of Montenegro.

24:43.233 --> 24:45.568
- Money vanished, no survivors.
- Delchev was suspected

24:45.610 --> 24:47.654
but he'd covered his tracks
with a trail of bodies.

24:47.696 --> 24:49.906
Three years ago,
we got warrants to raid his premises

24:49.948 --> 24:51.449
access safety deposit boxes

24:51.491 --> 24:53.952
but Luka had been tipped off.
He hid the money someplace

24:54.244 --> 24:56.871
we just didn't know where.
But you found it, didn't you, Maggie?

24:57.122 --> 25:00.125
I didn't find... I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:00.208 --> 25:02.377
It was in one of the storage lockers,
wasn't it?

25:02.419 --> 25:05.130
Took us a while to figure out who got it,
and by then you were gone

25:05.171 --> 25:07.382
so we watched Luka for three years

25:07.674 --> 25:09.801
until Frank and Joe Hooper
led us right to you.

25:10.093 --> 25:13.221
And you, Marius,
funny how you just keep popping up.

25:14.431 --> 25:15.557
We don't have the money.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.393
Even if there was money,
which there isn't...

25:19.978 --> 25:23.898
my acknowledging that
would be an admission of guilt, right?

25:24.024 --> 25:25.567
We don't care about either of you.

25:26.484 --> 25:27.736
All we want is Delchev.

25:27.986 --> 25:29.779
But to get him, we need your cooperation.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.866
- What does that mean?
- You lead Delchev to the money

25:32.991 --> 25:34.117
and us to Delchev.

25:34.242 --> 25:37.078
- We'll put him away for the rest of his life.
- You'll have to wear a wire.

25:37.287 --> 25:40.206
And we'll need the money
so we can install trackers and dye packs.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.752
In exchange, we let you both walk
on any and all charges

25:44.127 --> 25:47.047
including Marius' involvement
in the attempted murder

25:47.130 --> 25:49.632
of an FBI agent in Chinatown last week.

25:49.966 --> 25:53.261
But we need you to agree to these terms.
One-time offer.

25:53.720 --> 25:54.763
Sure, OK.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.974
Uh, if you guys had any real evidence

25:58.683 --> 26:01.936
um, I think I'd already be arrested, right?

26:02.520 --> 26:03.480
So, um...

26:04.522 --> 26:08.568
I'm gonna say book me now or...

26:08.860 --> 26:10.403
or let me go.

26:11.154 --> 26:14.449
Cos I need a smoke and I don't think...

26:14.532 --> 26:16.159
I don't think that's allowed in the...

26:16.326 --> 26:19.329
in the FBI offices, right?

26:26.920 --> 26:28.088
OK, thank you.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.714
- Fuck you.
- Have a good day.

26:32.634 --> 26:33.635
Look...

26:34.385 --> 26:35.637
Wait...

26:35.887 --> 26:37.055
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

26:37.305 --> 26:40.934
- Wait. Attempted murder of an FBI agent?
- It was the wrong place, wrong time.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.978
What should we do?
Should we cooperate with the FBI?

26:44.020 --> 26:45.230
No, no, no, we can't.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.315
If they don't get a conviction,
Luka walks, we're all dead.

26:47.357 --> 26:48.483
It's a fucking massacre.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.527
- But if you tell me where the money is...
- No.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.239
OK, then we're done.

26:55.156 --> 26:56.491
- We're done.
- No, but I...

26:56.616 --> 26:58.201
- You can catch a cab.
- I need your help.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.994
- You what? You need my help?
- I need your help, yeah.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.788
- You need my fucking help?
- That vision...

27:02.122 --> 27:06.376
that I told you about, for it to work,
everything has to be exactly as I saw it.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.170
And you're part of that vision.
Without you, it fails.

27:09.671 --> 27:12.632
And Luka kills me and my entire family.

27:19.639 --> 27:23.184
I'm sorry, Dad, but when I got there,
I just... I couldn't face her.

27:23.476 --> 27:24.769
Oh.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.313
Trust me, I know the feeling.
Don't worry about it.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.608
Hey, you haven't told me how great I look.

27:31.568 --> 27:33.987
- You look great, Dad.
- I look like shit.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.240
- And you...
- What?

27:37.532 --> 27:40.285
- Went grey.
- Oh, grey is in fashion right now.

27:40.702 --> 27:43.788
People... people pay good money
to get this look.

27:45.665 --> 27:46.541
I missed you.

27:47.292 --> 27:48.168
Hey, Taylor.

27:48.877 --> 27:50.712
Your Aunt Maggie needs some wine.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.094
Oh, whoa, whoa. Thank you.

28:00.388 --> 28:01.598
Yeah. Pete?

28:02.724 --> 28:04.392
We're ready for those mushrooms.

28:07.312 --> 28:08.313
Julia.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.398
Your children are beautiful.

28:10.690 --> 28:11.608
Thank you.

28:13.818 --> 28:15.278
Are their fathers involved?

28:15.904 --> 28:17.238
Not so much.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.032
Well, sometimes that's easier.

28:19.449 --> 28:20.491
That's what they tell me.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.702
Yeah, and then you gotta hear about it
from Audrey.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.538
She loves the Catholic guilt.

28:25.914 --> 28:28.041
Yeah, you'd think she
owns stock in it, or...

28:30.627 --> 28:31.794
Uh, Grandpa!

28:31.878 --> 28:34.714
I'm sure the doctor told you
to cut back on the salt.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.175
Oh, yeah! Yeah, I'm doing it.

28:38.384 --> 28:39.385
- Hey, Pete?
- Yeah.

28:39.469 --> 28:41.554
Do you remember the Corn Flakes?

28:42.222 --> 28:43.932
- The... the what?
- The Corn Flakes.

28:43.973 --> 28:44.891
Corn Flakes.

28:45.141 --> 28:46.017
Father's Day.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.645
Breakfast in bed.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.939
Seriously, you don't remember
the Corn Flakes?

28:57.487 --> 29:01.699
When I, uh... when I confused the sugar
with the salt on the cereal.

29:02.033 --> 29:05.286
And you loaded it on,
and you were so proud of it

29:05.662 --> 29:07.830
- that I had to eat it all!
- OK.

29:08.122 --> 29:09.916
Oh, yeah...

29:24.389 --> 29:25.473
Do you need a hand?

29:26.182 --> 29:27.225
No, thanks. All good.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.769
Look, I think we got off on the wrong foot.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.479
You think? Hm.

29:32.730 --> 29:35.066
I know that you're upset

29:35.149 --> 29:36.651
because I called you a bully.

29:39.195 --> 29:41.364
You know what? I was...

29:42.573 --> 29:45.368
an asshole to Pete sometimes
when we were kids, I was.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.287
But I was a kid.

29:49.497 --> 29:50.832
You were an adult

29:51.416 --> 29:53.835
when you turned
Grandma and Grandpa's lives upside down.

29:55.753 --> 29:58.715
Do you have any idea what it was like
around here after you took off?

30:00.216 --> 30:02.343
Because that's what I grew up with.

30:07.265 --> 30:08.641
I don't know why you're here.

30:09.183 --> 30:12.854
But if either you or Pete do anything more
to hurt this family

30:13.479 --> 30:14.772
you will deal with me.

30:18.526 --> 30:19.610
Just the truth.

30:39.380 --> 30:40.798
Oh, wow. Look who's here.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.509
I guess we're not having a barbecue.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.512
So we'll wait.
Get those two alone.

30:50.308 --> 30:51.642
Here comes Grandma.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.365
Oh, my God,
I can't wait to eat those mushrooms.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.241
- Yeah.
- It's so good.

31:41.859 --> 31:42.944
Come here.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.367
Oh...!

31:51.994 --> 31:52.912
Oh...

31:57.041 --> 32:00.211
What about the time
I was teaching you to drive?

32:00.670 --> 32:02.004
- No.
- Uh-huh!

32:02.088 --> 32:03.756
- No, no, don't.
- Oh, please, please.

32:03.798 --> 32:05.842
- Don't tell that story.
- You have to, please.

32:05.883 --> 32:07.385
- No, don't.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:07.427 --> 32:08.928
You were, what? You were, what, 16?

32:09.387 --> 32:12.974
I took Maggie up to the rooftop
of the Bridgeport Mall

32:13.057 --> 32:14.809
up the parking structure there.

32:15.143 --> 32:18.104
And it was Sunday morning.

32:18.229 --> 32:21.274
The place was empty, and she's doing great.

32:21.566 --> 32:23.901
- Mm-hm.
- Right? So I thought, "What the hell?

32:24.152 --> 32:26.946
- Time to drive home!"
- I said I didn't want to.

32:27.071 --> 32:28.656
- I told you.
- Yes, you did.

32:28.739 --> 32:29.991
And you didn't listen.

32:30.283 --> 32:31.701
No, I did not.

32:32.034 --> 32:35.788
Yeah, so she's here,
she's driving down the spiral ramp

32:35.913 --> 32:39.000
- and she's doing great, down the spiral ramp.
- I don't know how to drive.

32:39.208 --> 32:41.544
And she's really, really doing great

32:41.878 --> 32:45.047
and then suddenly, out of nowhere,
side wall, bam!

32:45.131 --> 32:46.507
Oh, my God.

32:48.509 --> 32:52.972
Veers to the left and smashes the car
against the wall and then blam-o!

32:53.097 --> 32:54.849
And I'm saying, "Pull over! Pull over!"

32:55.057 --> 32:57.101
And she just starts screaming.

32:57.268 --> 33:01.022
Where was I gonna pull over? Really?
Where was I gonna pull over? It's a ramp.

33:01.105 --> 33:03.232
What did you do? What did you do?

33:03.316 --> 33:05.193
- I kept driving!
- She kept driving.

33:05.276 --> 33:10.031
Driving all the way down.
Six parking levels and one car later.

33:10.198 --> 33:11.574
I'm asking, "Where's the brake?"

33:11.657 --> 33:13.284
- I don't even know.
- And the driving lesson ended.

33:13.367 --> 33:16.078
And then from then on,
I became the driving instructor

33:16.162 --> 33:17.914
- in the family.
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.415
Bad drive--

33:21.250 --> 33:25.046
Grandma hit a car in the mall parking lot.

33:26.464 --> 33:28.174
What? When?

33:29.175 --> 33:30.051
Uh...

33:31.093 --> 33:33.179
Yesterday. A fender bender, uh...

33:34.096 --> 33:35.181
Everything's fine.

33:36.891 --> 33:38.518
Why don't you clear the dishes, Carly?

33:38.559 --> 33:40.645
And I think you should start
with that wine glass.

33:48.194 --> 33:50.404
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

33:50.488 --> 33:51.948
Ho! Ho! Ho!

33:52.281 --> 33:53.824
Stop, everyone, stop.

33:55.368 --> 33:57.703
I would like to say a few words
before everybody leaves.

33:58.579 --> 34:00.623
Alright?

34:02.667 --> 34:05.503
When you wake up in the morning,
we don't know what

34:06.420 --> 34:08.464
each day is going to bring. Today...

34:09.757 --> 34:10.633
brought Maggie.

34:11.759 --> 34:14.887
Now, I have been around a while.

34:15.221 --> 34:19.892
And I have had some pretty close scrapes.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.437
You know, when I was a kid, in 'Nam

34:23.896 --> 34:27.858
uh, and a few more recently.

34:28.401 --> 34:32.238
At my age, you begin to understand

34:32.697 --> 34:34.156
that family...

34:35.032 --> 34:35.992
is everything.

34:36.450 --> 34:40.663
That's why I am so grateful
that we are all together.

34:41.998 --> 34:42.999
Uh-huh.

34:43.499 --> 34:44.709
Let's keep it this way.

34:48.004 --> 34:51.924
- Uh, I'd like to say a few words, too.
- Yeah, yeah.

34:52.258 --> 34:53.134
Um...

34:55.219 --> 34:56.178
Um...

34:56.762 --> 35:01.726
Being home after all these years
has been a little daunting.

35:01.892 --> 35:05.146
Uh, but you've all been very welcoming

35:05.229 --> 35:07.273
and I really, I do, I appreciate it.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.108
But, uh, it's...

35:09.734 --> 35:12.862
It's been pretty rough
the last 20 years, uh...

35:13.154 --> 35:15.656
but Pete's been there for me

35:16.032 --> 35:18.659
and my spiritualism

35:20.202 --> 35:23.873
has given me strength on my journey.

35:25.708 --> 35:26.709
I've learned a lot.

35:30.588 --> 35:33.674
But the main thing I've learned
is forgiveness.

35:35.593 --> 35:36.594
Mum...

35:38.220 --> 35:39.930
I want you to know that...

35:41.807 --> 35:42.808
I forgive you.

35:43.225 --> 35:47.563
And I just hope
that you can forgive yourself.

35:49.357 --> 35:51.067
Aunt Carly's throwing up.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.069
Oh, I'll go. I'll go.

35:53.235 --> 35:54.570
She asked for Aunt Maggie.

35:55.488 --> 35:56.572
Oh, OK.

35:59.283 --> 36:00.284
OK.

36:00.451 --> 36:02.286
Thanks for... thanks for, uh...

36:02.995 --> 36:06.791
Yeah, I... I got a work text.
I got to go. Sorry.

36:40.491 --> 36:42.618
How's it feel to be forgiven?

36:54.672 --> 36:56.674
You must be loving this.

36:58.134 --> 36:59.468
Oh, not so much.

37:00.094 --> 37:03.347
The holier-than-thou thing

37:03.681 --> 37:06.517
just really isn't playing for me.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.357
But you two are more alike
than I imagined.

37:15.985 --> 37:18.362
In what way could we possibly be alike?

37:19.905 --> 37:22.241
You're both strong-willed.

37:25.661 --> 37:26.662
And...

37:27.872 --> 37:30.499
you both pretty much say
whatever comes into your head.

37:36.130 --> 37:38.382
Your sister seems to be taken with her.

37:41.093 --> 37:42.428
She read her "aura."

37:45.181 --> 37:46.348
Carly loved it.

37:51.020 --> 37:54.774
I think she feels a connection to Mum.

38:06.911 --> 38:08.204
I have to go clean.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.051
I'm sorry about tonight.

38:22.092 --> 38:23.886
I should've told you she was coming.

38:24.804 --> 38:27.014
Is that why you left Bridgeport?
To get her?

38:27.306 --> 38:29.475
Well, I just didn't want
to get everybody's hopes up.

38:30.601 --> 38:32.770
She's a... bit of a hard target.

38:35.898 --> 38:38.734
I think I was about ten years old
before I realised that...

38:39.360 --> 38:41.654
she wasn't like other kids' mums.

38:42.154 --> 38:43.280
I swear I...

38:44.323 --> 38:47.076
if I thought of doing something wrong,
she'd know about it.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.286
She'd bust me before I even had the chance.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.372
She always been like that?

38:52.456 --> 38:54.875
When Maggie was a teenager, she told us

38:55.793 --> 38:56.919
she heard voices

38:57.753 --> 38:58.879
saw auras.

38:59.713 --> 39:04.176
First we thought it was some psychological
or neurological problem.

39:05.886 --> 39:08.222
But lots of expensive tests later

39:09.390 --> 39:11.141
doctors told us she was fine.

39:13.394 --> 39:16.021
- So you think it's real?
- I don't know.

39:19.567 --> 39:22.027
But I think it's real for her.

39:23.612 --> 39:24.488
Yeah.

39:26.323 --> 39:30.619
When I was 17, I drank way too much
Southern Comfort.

39:32.788 --> 39:35.040
And I threw up all night.

39:35.165 --> 39:38.043
And your mum, she held back my hair.

39:38.419 --> 39:42.256
She covered for me so that Mum and Dad
wouldn't find out.

39:42.381 --> 39:44.675
She saved my butt.

39:51.974 --> 39:54.018
Do you really think
that I look like my mum?

39:55.936 --> 39:58.272
Yeah, I do.

39:59.607 --> 40:02.484
Yeah, it's not just how you look, though.
Your whole...

40:03.193 --> 40:04.612
your spirit is like hers.

40:08.282 --> 40:10.034
Yeah. Here...

40:12.620 --> 40:14.371
Wow. Where'd you get these?

40:15.539 --> 40:16.790
Julia saved them.

40:18.626 --> 40:19.543
Are you upset?

40:20.711 --> 40:21.629
No.

40:22.922 --> 40:24.298
No, it's just, uh...

40:26.342 --> 40:28.093
They were very private at the time.

40:29.595 --> 40:32.222
Um, I'm glad you have them.

40:35.893 --> 40:37.144
Do you miss my mum?

40:37.770 --> 40:39.772
Yes, but we're still in touch.

40:41.065 --> 40:42.900
Death is just a, uh...

40:43.609 --> 40:45.611
transition for the spirit.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.238
Um, your mum and I...

40:50.157 --> 40:51.325
we talk all the time.

40:55.579 --> 40:56.789
Is she here now?

40:57.665 --> 40:59.541
Yeah, I, I feel her presence.

41:02.586 --> 41:03.963
She's looking out for you.

41:10.094 --> 41:11.512
Could I talk to her?

41:13.222 --> 41:14.640
Maybe, sometime.

41:15.432 --> 41:19.353
- But, but for now, you just sleep.
- OK.

41:24.274 --> 41:25.567
- Good night.
- Mm, good night.

41:30.864 --> 41:31.865
You guys going?

41:33.200 --> 41:34.743
Uh, we're coming back tomorrow.

41:35.452 --> 41:36.829
I was hoping I could have a word.

41:54.972 --> 41:56.640
- Should've got Schwartz's.
- What?

41:57.349 --> 41:58.517
The pastrami, it's the best.

41:59.601 --> 42:01.353
Oh, great. Thanks.

42:03.313 --> 42:06.817
- What're you doing here?
- Uh, you wanted to talk to me?

42:07.818 --> 42:08.944
Oh, shit.

42:09.236 --> 42:12.906
Oh, I'm so sorry. No, no, I had a question,
a jurisdiction issue.

42:12.948 --> 42:14.575
The desk sergeant helped me.
You didn't need to come in.

42:14.616 --> 42:15.576
It's OK, I...

42:15.784 --> 42:18.203
It gave me an excuse
to get out of some family stuff.

42:19.455 --> 42:20.330
Well...

42:21.290 --> 42:23.917
as long as you came all this way...

42:24.168 --> 42:25.377
Yes, yes.

42:26.378 --> 42:27.963
- Thank you.
- There you go. You deserve it.

42:30.758 --> 42:32.009
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

42:38.015 --> 42:39.516
- So what's going on here?
- Mm?

42:39.558 --> 42:42.102
Oh, just tying up some loose ends.
You know what? I...

42:42.895 --> 42:44.229
I never got a chance to tell you

42:44.855 --> 42:46.273
but I have been so lucky to have you.

42:47.608 --> 42:49.401
You're a really good cop.

42:49.985 --> 42:51.612
You ever consider going for detective?

42:51.820 --> 42:54.239
I took the exam and failed.

42:56.075 --> 42:57.409
Everybody fails the first time.

42:57.993 --> 42:59.787
- You?
- No.

43:00.621 --> 43:01.997
Mm-hmm.

43:03.874 --> 43:05.876
Well, what'd you get wrong?

43:06.960 --> 43:08.462
They... I mean, they don't tell you.

43:09.129 --> 43:12.007
But I know I screwed up evidence law.

43:13.217 --> 43:14.259
So take it again.

43:14.968 --> 43:16.345
You'd be a really good detective.

43:19.223 --> 43:20.182
You're too kind.

43:51.213 --> 43:52.089
What'd you, uh...

43:52.631 --> 43:55.217
- What'd you tell him?
- The truth.

44:22.452 --> 44:23.328
What?

44:27.332 --> 44:30.627
Did you know Pete was put in foster care
after Maggie was arrested?

44:31.170 --> 44:32.045
No.

44:33.088 --> 44:36.383
- How would I know that?
- I never should've let you call the police.

44:36.884 --> 44:37.926
Should've stopped you.

44:40.804 --> 44:44.516
She chose to bail out that asshole
of a boyfriend with our money

44:44.683 --> 44:46.101
and run off to California.

44:47.186 --> 44:48.103
Remember?

44:48.937 --> 44:50.397
We would've gone bankrupt.

44:51.523 --> 44:53.192
What the hell else could I have done?

44:53.483 --> 44:54.818
I should've gone after her.

44:54.902 --> 44:57.446
You had a business
and a family to take care of.

44:58.572 --> 45:00.949
And she would've run again,
cos that's what she does.

45:02.117 --> 45:04.870
You think I haven't wanted this,
all of us together in this house?

45:05.037 --> 45:06.371
I'm not some ogre.

45:06.455 --> 45:09.917
- I didn't say that you were.
- Something isn't right, Otto.

45:10.417 --> 45:14.046
Isn't it strange that after everything
that happened last week

45:14.671 --> 45:16.882
with Pete, the money, the police

45:16.965 --> 45:19.134
that Maggie suddenly shows up?

45:20.719 --> 45:24.765
I know you want to believe
this is a nice, happy family reunion

45:25.515 --> 45:26.808
but what do we know?

45:28.644 --> 45:31.438
Pete robbed a gun range three years ago.

45:31.480 --> 45:33.690
- I, I know, he said--
- I know what he said.

45:34.107 --> 45:36.902
The problem is,
I'm not sure if I believe it.

45:38.904 --> 45:40.906
I'm just happy they're back.

45:45.994 --> 45:47.371
And then I found the gun

45:47.454 --> 45:51.333
in the fireplace in the second-floor
apartment behind the drywall.

45:51.375 --> 45:54.253
Turns out the genius stuffed the gun
down the chimney of the row house

45:54.586 --> 45:55.963
like that scene in <i>The Godfather.</i>

45:56.213 --> 45:57.297
That's fucking amazing.

45:58.131 --> 45:59.007
But...

46:00.217 --> 46:02.177
it was actually <i>The Godfather II.</i>

46:03.679 --> 46:05.681
Oh, my God. Really?
Seriously, you're one of those guys?

46:06.682 --> 46:09.017
I'm sorry, but I am.

46:10.519 --> 46:13.021
- You want one more? Hm?
- No, that's it. Two-beer limit.

46:13.897 --> 46:16.358
Besides, I have to go back
to the city first thing.

46:16.858 --> 46:19.861
I'm, uh, bringing in the blood sample
from Winslow's car.

46:21.530 --> 46:22.906
I thought all the tests were done.

46:23.198 --> 46:25.325
Nope. Test here was just for type.

46:25.909 --> 46:27.619
In New York, we're doing a full panel.

46:28.161 --> 46:31.206
By the end of the week,
we're gonna have a complete DNA profile

46:31.248 --> 46:32.749
on whoever was in that car with him.

46:35.502 --> 46:36.920
- Bullshit.
- I don't care.

46:37.045 --> 46:37.921
Fine.

46:50.267 --> 46:51.601
I hope you changed your mind.

46:52.436 --> 46:55.522
- My God, I'm going to bed.
- You're making a big fucking mistake.

46:55.564 --> 46:57.232
Well, yeah, it wouldn't be the first time.

46:57.774 --> 46:59.067
He didn't die from the bullet.

46:59.318 --> 47:00.485
Your old boyfriend, Reggie?

47:00.527 --> 47:02.404
The doctors got the slug out.
He was gonna live.

47:02.446 --> 47:03.613
I read the ME's report.

47:03.655 --> 47:05.449
What Reggie went through with Luka,
I'd have talked.

47:05.657 --> 47:07.743
- But Reggie didn't.
- He protected you.

47:08.327 --> 47:09.661
Maybe you could do something for him

47:09.703 --> 47:12.247
and help us take down the man
who tortured him to death.

47:13.957 --> 47:15.334
- Who's Reggie?
- Alright...

47:15.459 --> 47:18.295
you don't wanna do it for your family,
you don't wanna do it for Reggie, fine.

47:21.048 --> 47:23.800
You know, whatever happens,
it's on you. Sleep tight.

47:26.219 --> 47:29.056
Well, good luck with your vision thing.

47:29.431 --> 47:32.726
No, you know what? I'm not gonna die over
some bullshit psychic vision.

47:32.809 --> 47:34.519
It's just like that FBI douchebag said.

47:34.728 --> 47:37.647
If Luka kills your whole family,
that's on you.

47:37.856 --> 47:39.316
I'm gonna get my shit

47:39.358 --> 47:40.650
- and get the fuck away from you.
- I'm sorry.

47:40.776 --> 47:42.819
- Can we discuss this, please?
- No, bullshit.

47:42.944 --> 47:44.571
- Discuss what?
- I, this is not...

47:45.364 --> 47:46.907
There's nothing to discuss here.

47:46.948 --> 47:49.743
I've done all I can to save you
and your family.

47:49.785 --> 47:51.286
- I need you, Marius.
- Well, that's too bad.

47:51.328 --> 47:53.705
- You're part of my vision.
- Stop talking about your vision!

47:54.081 --> 47:55.499
Fuck you, man!

47:55.540 --> 47:57.667
- You've caused me this kind of trouble.
- Oh, hey.

47:58.126 --> 47:59.711
Well, it's a good thing you guys are here.

47:59.753 --> 48:01.546
- You working with the Fed?
- The what? No.

48:01.588 --> 48:03.715
- You wearing a wire?
- I'm not wearing, no, no, no.

48:04.049 --> 48:06.259
No, they grabbed us.
I swear, we didn't say anything.

48:06.426 --> 48:09.471
- Shut the fuck up! Get the fuck over here!
- Alright, wait, wait.

48:09.513 --> 48:11.515
I'm just gonna get some--

48:11.598 --> 48:13.600
What do you need? What? Come on.

48:13.809 --> 48:15.102
You don't need shit!

48:15.685 --> 48:17.312
Put on your scared face.

48:18.271 --> 48:19.231
We're going to Luka.

48:23.026 --> 48:25.362
What's so important
that it couldn't wait until morning?

48:26.154 --> 48:28.031
She has a sample of your blood
from the car.

48:29.366 --> 48:32.536
By the end of the week, Roby will be able
to identify you as the passenger.

48:40.210 --> 48:41.920
Don't they need a court order

48:42.003 --> 48:43.839
- to get a person's DNA?
- Yeah.

48:44.423 --> 48:46.049
But she may have enough for a warrant.

48:48.093 --> 48:51.471
I can't have any of this land on you.

48:54.224 --> 48:56.726
If there's no other choice,
I'll turn myself in.

48:56.893 --> 48:58.103
That wouldn't solve anything.

48:59.146 --> 49:01.982
You, me, Grandpa, Pete,
we're all implicated.

49:04.025 --> 49:09.072
I need Roby to think, to know,
that someone else killed Winslow.

49:11.116 --> 49:12.242
I need to get the gun.

49:15.579 --> 49:16.663
I woke you?

49:17.205 --> 49:19.666
Good. You sleep too much.

49:20.709 --> 49:21.585
Huh?

49:22.210 --> 49:25.213
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm drunk.

49:27.382 --> 49:30.927
Doesn't matter.
What I'm... what I'm telling you is this.

49:32.262 --> 49:33.889
I need to finish this thing for Moe.

49:35.015 --> 49:36.808
I let all this...

49:37.976 --> 49:40.395
All this happened because of me.

49:41.021 --> 49:42.439
I let something happen before.

49:43.315 --> 49:44.524
I'm not doing it again.

49:46.151 --> 49:47.027
So...

49:48.487 --> 49:50.572
I need to get that proclamation back.

49:52.908 --> 49:55.494
You gonna help me or what?

49:57.120 --> 49:59.456
Please. Maggie Murphy.

50:03.001 --> 50:04.794
I have been looking forward
to meeting you.

50:04.961 --> 50:07.964
I must tell you, though,
you're a slippery one.

50:09.049 --> 50:10.509
But you also must know

50:10.967 --> 50:13.595
a Montenegrin never gives up.

50:13.845 --> 50:16.223
I... I didn't know.
I didn't know that you were from...

50:17.265 --> 50:18.183
Montenegro.

50:19.559 --> 50:20.435
Who's this?

50:21.728 --> 50:22.604
Is he your son?

50:25.941 --> 50:27.025
He's a good-looking boy.

50:28.944 --> 50:30.862
We have so much to talk about.

50:31.238 --> 50:32.739
But first...

50:33.490 --> 50:34.866
anyone care for some coffee?

50:35.367 --> 50:36.243
It's fresh.

50:37.953 --> 50:39.287
No, thank you.

50:40.121 --> 50:43.124
These two, they know my passion for coffee.

50:43.875 --> 50:44.960
- You want some?
- No.

50:45.001 --> 50:46.086
- No, thank you.
- Huh?

50:48.755 --> 50:49.631
No, thanks.

50:50.215 --> 50:51.091
I'm alright.

50:51.800 --> 50:54.511
Joe, come on.
You liked my coffee last time.

50:54.553 --> 50:56.012
- This is new bean.
- It's a good bean.

50:56.054 --> 50:56.930
Smell it.

50:59.558 --> 51:00.850
Motherfucker!

51:02.894 --> 51:04.813
You motherfuck...

51:05.397 --> 51:07.732
Yes. Tough guy!

51:08.441 --> 51:10.318
- Ah, you mother...
- You gonna kill me?

51:11.069 --> 51:12.946
Huh?

51:13.530 --> 51:16.032
- Huh? Asshole!
- Oh, you motherfucker!

51:16.157 --> 51:18.785
Huh? Frank fucking told me

51:18.827 --> 51:20.745
you stupid fuck!

51:20.829 --> 51:23.248
He wasn't gonna do anything.
I had everything under control.

51:24.040 --> 51:26.084
You did not have everything under control.

51:26.293 --> 51:30.213
You got something very, very wrong.

51:31.131 --> 51:33.008
Oh, my God.

51:33.383 --> 51:36.052
Miro? Shut him the fuck up.

51:36.595 --> 51:37.721
No...

51:54.821 --> 51:56.865
Do you know what they got wrong?

51:57.616 --> 51:58.491
What?

52:01.620 --> 52:02.537
How about you?

52:07.125 --> 52:08.501
Do you know, Maggie Murphy?

52:09.336 --> 52:11.630
He's not my son.

52:12.714 --> 52:13.923
Bingo.

52:17.510 --> 52:19.471
You and Joe

52:19.512 --> 52:22.182
had wrong fucking guy

52:22.307 --> 52:23.892
from start.

52:24.142 --> 52:25.060
Never knew.

52:25.685 --> 52:27.062
A con man!

52:28.438 --> 52:31.149
Coming to steal my money!

52:32.484 --> 52:34.110
I should kill you, too.

52:35.320 --> 52:37.072
Ah, ah, ah.

52:41.284 --> 52:42.160
Hey.

52:43.787 --> 52:45.413
You remember me, Marius?

52:46.164 --> 52:48.166
- No.
- It's OK.

52:50.752 --> 52:52.128
We never actually met.

52:53.963 --> 52:56.341
Billy Primo said your name once.

52:56.675 --> 52:58.635
- You remember Billy?
- Yes, I do.

52:59.177 --> 53:01.680
He was meaning to hire you to con my niece.

53:03.723 --> 53:06.267
Ah, ah, ah, naturally, I looked you up.

53:07.060 --> 53:09.646
You didn't take the job, so you lived.

53:10.146 --> 53:11.022
Anyway...

53:12.065 --> 53:14.150
stories for another day.

53:16.778 --> 53:17.654
Now...

53:26.037 --> 53:30.083
Where the fuck is my money?
