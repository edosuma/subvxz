00:01.710 --> 00:03.711
NARRATOR: Tonight
on The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.711 --> 00:05.629
A special two-hour event.

00:05.629 --> 00:07.464
Whoa-ho! Not since Moses

00:07.464 --> 00:08.800
has the water
been held back so well.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.926
The stars align to the island.

00:10.926 --> 00:12.220
This is a star map

00:12.220 --> 00:13.596
to where
the actual treasure is.

00:13.596 --> 00:14.723
JACK:
This is one of your points.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.557
There's a huge boulder
over here.

00:16.557 --> 00:18.559
-JACK: It could be a landmark.
-Look at that.

00:18.559 --> 00:20.728
CRAIG:
Almost all of them are leaking.

00:20.728 --> 00:23.356
Oh, we're severely compromised.
We can't function like this.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.899
DOUG: I think we've got
something over here.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.067
Oh, look.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.609
There's something carved there.

00:27.609 --> 00:29.111
Holy smokes.

00:29.111 --> 00:31.071
I do think this
is the 90 Foot Stone.

00:33.365 --> 00:36.994
NARRATOR: There is an island
 in the North Atlantic

00:36.994 --> 00:40.497
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:40.497 --> 00:43.792
for more than 200 years.

00:43.792 --> 00:46.838
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:46.838 --> 00:49.506
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:49.506 --> 00:52.343
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:52.343 --> 00:56.180
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:56.180 --> 00:58.682
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:58.682 --> 01:03.188
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.316
And, according to legend,

01:06.316 --> 01:09.444
one more will have to die

01:09.444 --> 01:13.114
before the treasure
can be found.

NARRATOR: It is the start
 of another promising day

01:40.641 --> 01:42.185
on Oak Island,

01:42.185 --> 01:46.480
as Rick Lagina calls his
brother Marty from the war room

01:46.480 --> 01:49.275
to report on the team's
recent progress.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.527
Morning.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.777
Hey, Rick.

01:51.777 --> 01:54.239
-How's it going out there?
-Really good.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.241
Uh, you know how we hate
to say that, but the last

01:57.241 --> 01:59.828
of the sheet pile should
go in today in Smith's Cove.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.287
-Uh...
-Yes.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.996
You know, we're on the brink

02:02.996 --> 02:04.665
of starting that project,

02:04.665 --> 02:05.959
and it's exciting.

02:07.876 --> 02:10.002
And it's actually up in the air.

02:10.002 --> 02:11.338
MARTY:
Wow,

02:11.338 --> 02:12.674
look how fast they're going.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.759
NARRATOR:
 Four weeks ago,

02:14.759 --> 02:16.677
Rick, Marty and their partners,

02:16.677 --> 02:20.181
along with the team
from Irving Equipment, Limited,

02:20.181 --> 02:23.560
began construction
on their most ambitious

02:23.560 --> 02:26.103
and costliest project to date.

02:26.103 --> 02:31.359
A 525-foot-long steel cofferdam
surrounding Smith's Cove.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.069
Quite impressive.

02:33.069 --> 02:36.573
NARRATOR: So far, nearly all
 of what will be

02:36.573 --> 02:39.408
117 interlocking steel sheets

02:39.408 --> 02:44.079
have been driven some
25 feet deep into the seabed.

02:44.079 --> 02:46.957
This will allow the team
to effectively

02:46.957 --> 02:49.961
seal off Smith's Cove
from the Atlantic Ocean,

02:49.961 --> 02:51.753
drain the area,

02:51.753 --> 02:55.300
and then conduct
an intensive excavation.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.552
It's very exciting
to be able to really excavate

02:58.552 --> 02:59.721
in Smith's Cove, and I think

02:59.721 --> 03:01.806
the sheet piling system
is gonna do it.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.515
RICK
 And the hope, of course,

03:03.515 --> 03:05.977
is that we will find
whatever there is

03:05.977 --> 03:07.854
to find in Smith's Cove.

03:07.854 --> 03:12.150
My hope is, who and when
those answers will be...

03:12.150 --> 03:13.443
dealt with.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.527
MARTY:
Hey, Rick, it occurs to me,

03:15.527 --> 03:17.947
you know,
we had a lot of trouble

03:17.947 --> 03:19.657
just washing
the hammer grab stuff

03:19.657 --> 03:21.950
last year and we're gonna be
looking for anything

03:21.950 --> 03:23.995
we can find in Smith's Cove.

03:23.995 --> 03:27.664
NARRATOR: In past years,
 all of the team's spoils

03:27.664 --> 03:29.667
had to be painstakingly washed

03:29.667 --> 03:32.670
and then carefully
sifted by hand.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.588
GARY:
I'm not seeing anything.

03:36.799 --> 03:39.676
Back to the spoil piles.
Come on, baby.

03:39.676 --> 03:41.763
NARRATOR:
 The process was not only messy

03:41.763 --> 03:44.264
but was so painstakingly slow

03:44.264 --> 03:46.099
that much of the material

03:46.099 --> 03:47.936
couldn't be examined
for several days.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.812
Or in some cases, months.

03:50.812 --> 03:53.942
You know, any thoughts about
the massive amount of material?

03:53.942 --> 03:56.276
You know, uh,
the good news about that

03:56.276 --> 03:58.028
is there's a wash plant,
turns out,

03:58.028 --> 03:59.489
for sale at a quarry.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.949
So, uh, I'm gonna go look at it.

04:01.949 --> 04:03.533
It's still in operation,

04:03.533 --> 04:05.036
so we can actually fire it up.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.579
Well, good on you, Rick.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.330
Because it's gonna be
a logistical issue,

04:08.330 --> 04:09.623
handling all that material.

04:09.623 --> 04:11.668
Especially since, you know,

04:11.668 --> 04:14.002
the exercise would be pointless
if we don't search it all.

04:14.002 --> 04:15.879
-Absolutely.
-MARTY: Good.

04:15.879 --> 04:18.007
Can't wait to go and join you.
I'll be out there tomorrow.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.550
Appreciate that, we miss you.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.009
-So get back here.
-All right.

04:21.009 --> 04:22.220
See you tomorrow then,
big brother.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.221
RICK:
 All right, see you.

04:26.098 --> 04:28.475
NARRATOR: Following the call
 with his brother Marty,

04:28.475 --> 04:32.146
Rick Lagina, Charles Barkhouse,
Dave Blankenship,

04:32.146 --> 04:34.816
and Dan Henskee
head to Smith's Cove,

04:34.816 --> 04:36.858
where the team
from Irving Equipment, Limited

04:36.858 --> 04:39.528
is about to complete
construction

04:39.528 --> 04:42.740
of the massive steel cofferdam.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.617
RICK:
I think we're just about done.

04:44.617 --> 04:48.079
-How many more sheets, Mike?
-That's the last one.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.997
-That's it?
-Yeah.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.042
RICK:
How far are these e-embedded?

04:53.042 --> 04:55.670
MIKE J.: Uh, well, you see
the 20-foot mark right there,

04:55.670 --> 04:59.215
so we've got about 17 feet
of embedment into the dirt.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.966
Tell you what,
it couldn't have gone better,

05:00.966 --> 05:03.218
given all the potential
problems.

05:03.218 --> 05:04.345
No, it-it went quite well, yeah.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.596
RICK:
But you do believe we've got

05:06.596 --> 05:08.598
to put two six-inch pumps
on there?

05:08.598 --> 05:10.435
You have to draw
the groundwaters out of it

05:10.435 --> 05:12.562
because if you don't,

05:12.562 --> 05:15.105
you'll have a continuous flow
just trickling in

05:15.105 --> 05:17.483
all the time that you're
gonna be battling against.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.110
And you have to get that out
to be able to maintain it.

05:20.110 --> 05:21.862
Right, right.

05:21.862 --> 05:25.408
NARRATOR: Before the team
 can begin their excavation

05:25.408 --> 05:27.701
of the cove, the entire area

05:27.701 --> 05:29.911
must be completely drained
of more than

05:29.911 --> 05:32.040
100,000 gallons of seawater.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.752
To accomplish this,
the team will be using

05:36.752 --> 05:39.213
two 12-horsepower sump pumps,

05:39.213 --> 05:41.340
each running 15 hours a day.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.262
And we have the possibility
of finding some,

05:46.262 --> 05:48.555
hopefully, some culturally
influenced artifacts

05:48.555 --> 05:50.641
that will answer some
of the who, what, when,

05:50.641 --> 05:52.393
-where, why, and how questions.
-MIKE J.: Yes.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.646
No, I think you're gonna uncover
a lot of information here

05:55.646 --> 05:56.980
that's gonna really help.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.399
I think you
and your team should be

05:58.399 --> 05:59.649
very proud
of what you accomplished,

05:59.649 --> 06:01.860
-and we're very grateful for it.
-Yeah.

06:01.860 --> 06:04.488
-Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it.
-Great, guys. Good luck.

06:04.488 --> 06:05.740
RICK:
 We could use some.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.163
NARRATOR:
 Later that day...

06:12.163 --> 06:15.665
as the team begins preparations
to drain Smith's Cove...

06:15.665 --> 06:17.418
JACK: All right,
 where do you want it, Charles?

06:17.418 --> 06:19.170
CHARLES: Well, look, I got
a couple blocks over here.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.129
-Why don't we set it up
on those?
-Okay.

06:21.129 --> 06:23.673
NARRATOR:
Jack Begley, Charles Barkhouse,

06:23.673 --> 06:25.843
and researcher Doug Crowell

06:25.843 --> 06:28.762
install a new artifact
for display

06:28.762 --> 06:30.764
at the Oak Island
Interpretive Center.

06:30.764 --> 06:32.225
Everybody be careful...

06:32.225 --> 06:34.476
'cause this thing is heavy.

06:34.476 --> 06:36.394
DOUG:
 Charles has asked Jack and I

06:36.394 --> 06:38.480
to come over and help
him move a stone that, uh,

06:38.480 --> 06:40.817
Fred Nolan had found years ago.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.776
Fred thought it was
a boundary marker

06:42.776 --> 06:44.362
or perhaps a pointer stone

06:44.362 --> 06:47.115
that pointed into the swamp,
in Fred's opinion.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.951
It definitely was a stone
that was worked by man.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.952
It was triangular in shape;
made it really unusual.

06:51.952 --> 06:54.788
I wish I had seen it in
its original location, but...

06:54.788 --> 06:56.790
I think it's gonna find
a fitting home

06:56.790 --> 06:58.292
on display for the public.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.502
CHARLES:
I know Fred put great importance

07:00.502 --> 07:03.047
on this stone
as a survey monument.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.007
And it's been in storage
for quite a while,

07:05.007 --> 07:07.802
and I've been quite anxious
to get it in the museum.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.971
JACK:
Well, it's nice that we have it
next to the 90 Foot Stone.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.596
DOUG:
Yeah, when you think of elements

07:11.596 --> 07:14.057
in the original legend
and the lore of Oak Island...

07:14.057 --> 07:16.476
-Yeah.
-the 90 Foot Stone
is pretty prominent.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.896
NARRATOR:
 For more than two centuries,

07:19.896 --> 07:22.399
the 90 Foot Stone
has been the subject

07:22.399 --> 07:25.610
of numerous theories,
speculations, and myths.

07:25.610 --> 07:29.115
It was discovered in 1804

07:29.115 --> 07:31.324
while treasure hunters
were excavating

07:31.324 --> 07:33.161
the original Money Pit.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.620
At every ten feet,
they found evidence

07:35.620 --> 07:38.707
of wooden platforms made
of oak planking.

07:38.707 --> 07:41.668
But when they reached
a depth of 90 feet,

07:41.668 --> 07:44.338
they discovered
a large olive-colored slab

07:44.338 --> 07:47.425
with a series of strange
markings carved into it,

07:47.425 --> 07:50.011
markings which,
when later translated,

07:50.011 --> 07:51.678
were believed to read:

07:51.678 --> 07:56.350
"Forty feet below,
two million pounds are buried."

07:56.350 --> 07:58.226
When the stone
was first removed,

07:58.226 --> 08:00.228
it seemed to trigger
a booby trap

08:00.228 --> 08:02.230
which flooded the Money Pit,

08:02.230 --> 08:05.192
a situation
that continues to plague

08:05.192 --> 08:07.819
that area of the island
to this day.

08:09.237 --> 08:11.531
You know,
I'd really like to get back

08:11.531 --> 08:13.408
to the bookbindery
and take another look.

08:13.408 --> 08:15.369
I feel like when we were
in the basement there

08:15.369 --> 08:17.913
and exploring around,
that we never fully got

08:17.913 --> 08:20.249
under all of the foundation
of the bookbindery itself.

08:20.249 --> 08:21.918
I don't think we did.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.211
ALEX: This photo
is the last known location

08:24.211 --> 08:26.547
-of the 90 Foot Stone.
-KEL: This is it.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.257
And we're looking at it,
I can tell right now.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.550
-Right there.
-That's it.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.052
NARRATOR: Two years ago,
 Doug and Charles,

08:32.052 --> 08:33.888
along with Alex Lagina,

08:33.888 --> 08:37.225
visited the Nova Scotia
College of Art and Design

08:37.225 --> 08:39.268
in nearby Halifax,

08:39.268 --> 08:41.895
the place where
the 90 Foot Stone

08:41.895 --> 08:45.316
was last seen
nearly 100 years ago.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.735
They were hoping to find,
if not the actual stone,

08:48.735 --> 08:51.905
information that might lead
to its current whereabouts.

08:51.905 --> 08:53.783
DOUG: Careful
of the debris on the floor.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.244
ALEX:
Yeah. Geez, look at this place.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.288
NARRATOR: But after searching
 through a virtual maze

08:59.288 --> 09:01.916
of basement corridors
and crawl spaces,

09:01.916 --> 09:04.793
they found no sign
of the mysterious artifact.

09:04.793 --> 09:07.546
ALEX:
I think it's a bust.

09:07.546 --> 09:10.591
If we can bring
the 90 Foot Stone back home,

09:10.591 --> 09:12.217
-that would be a good day.

09:12.217 --> 09:13.469
-Mm-hmm.
-Yep.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.013
I think it'd be worth
contacting the bookbindery

09:16.013 --> 09:18.099
-and have another look.
-Yeah.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.350
About time I made that call.

09:20.350 --> 09:23.354
CHARLES: We'll lock up
and get out of here.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.605
JACK:
 Let's get back to work.

09:28.650 --> 09:32.446
owing his review
 of operations at Smith's Cove,

09:32.446 --> 09:35.950
Rick Lagina,
along with Dave Blankenship

09:35.950 --> 09:38.702
and geophysical engineer
John Wonnacott,

09:38.702 --> 09:41.288
travel some 20 miles southwest

09:41.288 --> 09:44.125
to the town
of Bridgewater, Nova Scotia.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.586
There's Rhodes Corner Quarry.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.463
They have come to check out
an industrial-sized wash plant,

09:50.463 --> 09:53.884
one they hope will be able
to process the massive amount

09:53.884 --> 09:55.760
of spoils that
will be dredged up

09:55.760 --> 09:59.181
during the excavation
of Smith's Cove.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.725
I mean, we know
that Smith's Cove presents...

10:01.725 --> 10:05.687
certainly,
a variety of problems.

10:05.687 --> 10:08.149
One of which is:
how do you process

10:08.149 --> 10:10.484
such a huge volume of material?

10:10.484 --> 10:13.696
And the hope is that this is
something that we may be able

10:13.696 --> 10:15.865
to utilize
as part of our process.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.741
RICK:
That's the machine, I take it?

10:17.741 --> 10:19.493
BILLY:
That's the machine, yep.

10:19.493 --> 10:22.120
Can you just give us a basic
rundown of the operation?

10:22.120 --> 10:25.081
I mean, I get the point--
the material goes in the hopper.

10:25.081 --> 10:27.876
But then exactly what happens?

10:27.876 --> 10:29.336
Well, it is very simple, Rick.

10:29.336 --> 10:31.004
You put it in the hopper,
like you said.

10:31.004 --> 10:33.341
It kicks it up at that point,
and it takes it up

10:33.341 --> 10:36.134
to the screener deck, and
it does the screening process

10:36.134 --> 10:38.636
-as they are shaking.
-RICK: Do you think

10:38.636 --> 10:41.724
you can get this started for us,
so we could take a look at it?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.683
-I can start it up if you want.
-Yep.

10:45.769 --> 10:47.520
♪ ♪

10:50.774 --> 10:52.860
(engine starts)

10:57.615 --> 11:00.533
(loud rumbling)

11:05.538 --> 11:08.083
NARRATOR: As each load
 of excavated material,

11:08.083 --> 11:11.211
or "spoils,"
is fed into the hopper,

11:11.211 --> 11:14.090
they will be transported
by way of a conveyor belt,

11:14.090 --> 11:16.509
up and into a heavy-duty grate

11:16.509 --> 11:20.053
which will filter out
any large rocks or debris.

11:20.053 --> 11:23.224
The remaining spoils
are then distributed

11:23.224 --> 11:25.308
onto two separate shaker decks

11:25.308 --> 11:28.604
where they are then sorted
according to size.

11:28.604 --> 11:32.149
Soil and bits of sediment
are literally shaken off,

11:32.149 --> 11:34.402
as a series
of fixed spray nozzles

11:34.402 --> 11:36.695
wash the spoils clean.

11:36.695 --> 11:39.407
They are then deposited
into uniform piles

11:39.407 --> 11:42.951
that will be further examined
by hand for possible artifacts

11:42.951 --> 11:46.121
or, hopefully,
evidence of treasure.

11:46.121 --> 11:47.789
(engine turns off)

11:47.789 --> 11:50.584
RICK: We can't do it
 as we have done before,

11:50.584 --> 11:52.253
hand-washing the material.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.965
The volume of material is
far too great.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.259
It's very simple--
the wash plant will allow us

11:58.259 --> 12:00.719
to move material, wash it,

12:00.719 --> 12:03.764
and then get Gary Drayton
to metal-detect it.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.142
I'll be honest, I think we
should pull the trigger on this.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.852
I think we should really do it
and get it set up

12:08.852 --> 12:10.354
-and get going.
-Yeah.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.440
I know one thing--
Gary Drayton's gonna be

12:12.440 --> 12:14.942
-on a pogo stick.
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

12:17.570 --> 12:20.697
NARRATOR:
 Later that same day...

12:20.697 --> 12:22.825
GARY:
Just here now, please.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.909
Alex Lagina and Peter Fornetti,

12:24.909 --> 12:28.121
along with metal detection
expert Gary Drayton,

12:28.121 --> 12:30.541
head to Lot 24,

12:30.541 --> 12:34.003
located on the western side
of the island.

12:34.003 --> 12:37.755
This lot's got a lot
of potential.

12:37.755 --> 12:38.756
We'll follow you.

12:38.756 --> 12:40.801
Now that the wooded lots

12:40.801 --> 12:42.802
have been largely cleared
of brush,

12:42.802 --> 12:47.015
Gary will be able to use his
metal detector to scan the area

12:47.015 --> 12:49.809
in search of potentially
important artifacts.

12:49.809 --> 12:52.687
And you can see
how thick this is.

12:52.687 --> 12:53.938
Yep.

12:53.938 --> 12:56.357
I mean, before,
you couldn't even swing

12:56.357 --> 12:58.818
a metal detector in here.

12:58.818 --> 12:59.861
Right.

12:59.861 --> 13:01.029
Going through these areas

13:01.029 --> 13:02.490
that were previously forested

13:02.490 --> 13:03.865
and difficult
to metal-detect in,

13:03.865 --> 13:05.408
we're really hoping
that this trip

13:05.408 --> 13:07.620
is gonna net us
some pretty cool stuff.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.998
(beeping)

13:10.998 --> 13:13.500
GARY:
That sounds good.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.337
Should be able to just clear it
and get closer to it.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.634
(beeping)

13:26.514 --> 13:27.972
(beeping)

13:31.519 --> 13:33.520
(beeping)

13:37.774 --> 13:39.567
(whispers):
Oh, man.

13:39.567 --> 13:42.446
Oh, man, this is interesting.
Look at that.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.697
-Whoo-hoo!
-ALEX: What's that?
-What is it?

13:44.697 --> 13:46.700
That definitely looks
like a ramrod to me.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.202
NARRATOR:
 A ramrod? An object used

13:49.202 --> 13:52.288
in the loading
of muskets and early rifles?

13:52.288 --> 13:54.415
PETER: How old
do you think this would be?

13:54.415 --> 13:57.586
If that's a ramrod to,
like, a Brown Bess musket,

13:57.586 --> 14:01.548
that would put it
at late 1700s, early 1800s.

14:01.548 --> 14:03.133
ALEX:
Wow.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.260
NARRATOR:
 From the early 18th...

14:05.260 --> 14:08.179
-MAN: Fire!
 -to mid-19th centuries,

14:08.179 --> 14:11.432
the Land Pattern musket--
nicknamed "Brown Bess"--

14:11.432 --> 14:14.979
was standard issue among
members of the British army.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.230
Holy smokes.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.481
Look at these.

14:18.481 --> 14:20.734
These are all British coppers.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.570
-All in one spot?
-Yep.
-Yeah.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.446
NARRATOR:
 In the past two years,

14:24.446 --> 14:26.573
Gary and the team have found

14:26.573 --> 14:28.576
a number of artifacts
on Lot 24,

14:28.576 --> 14:32.788
including British musket balls
and uniform buttons,

14:32.788 --> 14:36.375
which indicate
that Oak Island was once used

14:36.375 --> 14:38.251
as an 18th century
military encampment,

14:38.251 --> 14:42.338
probably during the time
of the American Revolution.

14:43.631 --> 14:45.509
GARY:
Oh, man, that's sweet.

14:45.509 --> 14:46.884
We'll show that to Laird.

14:46.884 --> 14:48.636
Right.

14:48.636 --> 14:51.432
See if there's
anything else in the area.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.317
(beeping)

15:02.317 --> 15:04.778
GARY:
Yeah, we can't pass on this one.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.071
ALEX:
Okay.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.032
(beeping)

15:08.032 --> 15:09.908
(electronic squealing)

15:16.706 --> 15:18.125
ALEX:
Under a rock?

15:18.125 --> 15:19.293
(beeping)

15:19.293 --> 15:21.044
GARY:
Just to the side of it.

15:21.044 --> 15:23.297
-I'll use my little trowel.
-(beeping)

15:29.927 --> 15:31.596
(beeping)

15:32.889 --> 15:35.308
Wow, that...
that's a freaking bone!

15:38.394 --> 15:41.190
That's a bone, isn't it?

15:41.190 --> 15:43.484
ALEX:
Yeah, it looks like it.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.611
GARY:
Wow. Keep that to one side.

15:46.611 --> 15:48.322
See if there's
any more in there.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.073
NARRATOR:
 If the bone is determined

15:50.073 --> 15:52.659
to be of human origin,
it could be

15:52.659 --> 15:55.245
one of the team's
most significant finds.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.664
It could provide
an important clue

15:57.664 --> 15:59.917
as to who was on the island

15:59.917 --> 16:04.087
prior to the discovery
of the Money Pit in 1795.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.176
GARY: Is that a bone as well,
or is that a rock?

16:09.176 --> 16:10.927
Oh, a pottery!
A piece of pottery!

16:10.927 --> 16:12.428
-Really?
-Yeah!

16:12.428 --> 16:13.889
-ALEX: Oh, yeah.
-GARY: Wow.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.349
Now we're getting interesting.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.350
A bone and a bit
of blue-glazed pottery.

16:17.350 --> 16:19.352
-'Cause this is the old stuff.
-Yeah.

16:19.352 --> 16:22.398
Pretty confident saying this is
more than likely early 1700s.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.524
-ALEX: You think so?
-Yeah.

16:24.524 --> 16:25.859
NARRATOR:
 Pottery?

16:25.859 --> 16:28.278
Possibly from the early 1700s?

16:28.278 --> 16:30.989
And found buried
with a piece of bone?

16:30.989 --> 16:34.659
Prior to the discovery
of the Money Pit,

16:34.659 --> 16:37.870
not much is known
about the history of Oak Island

16:37.870 --> 16:42.042
or details about
the area's early inhabitants.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.628
In addition
to the indigenous peoples--

16:44.628 --> 16:47.588
known as the Mi'kmaq--
Portuguese and Spanish sailors

16:47.588 --> 16:49.674
were known
to frequent the waters

16:49.674 --> 16:54.303
of Nova Scotia's Mahone Bay
as early as the 16th century.

16:54.303 --> 16:57.515
Later visitors included
the French and English,

16:57.515 --> 17:01.812
many of whom settled here
and began to develop Oak Island

17:01.812 --> 17:05.816
as a place for farming
and grazing livestock.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.568
If the bone
and pottery fragments

17:08.568 --> 17:10.738
can be definitively dated

17:10.738 --> 17:13.449
to some time
before the late 1700s,

17:13.449 --> 17:16.951
it could give insight not only
to who may have inhabited

17:16.951 --> 17:19.954
Oak Island
hundreds of years ago

17:19.954 --> 17:21.914
but what they were doing here.

17:22.915 --> 17:25.085
Wha...? Ooh! Look at that!

17:25.085 --> 17:27.627
This is crazy-- we've got
this high-tech metal detector...

17:27.627 --> 17:29.298
ALEX:
Yeah, we would've missed this.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.090
...and then we're putting
our hands in the hole

17:31.090 --> 17:32.425
pulling out old pottery.

17:32.425 --> 17:34.552
ALEX: Gary's reaching
 into this-this hole

17:34.552 --> 17:35.554
that we've dug,

17:35.554 --> 17:37.388
looking for a metal object.

17:37.388 --> 17:39.767
Next thing you know, he's
pulling out shards of pottery

17:39.767 --> 17:41.809
from the hole-- every handful,
it seems like, that he's

17:41.809 --> 17:44.313
pulling out of this hole, he's
finding something significant.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.190
And we haven't even found
the metal object yet.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.859
-(beeping)
-All right, let's see
what else is in here.

17:51.778 --> 17:54.364
-(beeping)
-Yeah, I'm on it.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.700
It's definitely there.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.618
Where the heck is it?

17:58.618 --> 18:01.622
Must be deeper.

18:01.622 --> 18:02.998
(beeping)

18:02.998 --> 18:05.792
Oh. I see something.

18:05.792 --> 18:09.253
-ALEX: Oh, great.
-Yep. What the heck is that?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.800
That looks like a little latch,
doesn't it, to a door?

18:13.800 --> 18:15.469
-ALEX: It does, yeah.
-PETER: Oh, yeah.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.386
This is nice.
I mean, look at this

18:17.386 --> 18:20.598
-as a group.
-Yes. Yep, all in the same area.

18:20.598 --> 18:24.560
GARY: What these different
pieces of materials tell me,

18:24.560 --> 18:26.980
I believe this is a new site.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.316
And that
would really be fantastic.

18:29.316 --> 18:32.109
-Yeah. Call Uncle Rick?
-Yep.

18:32.109 --> 18:34.153
I think with the potential
British military encampment

18:34.153 --> 18:35.989
so close by on the island,

18:35.989 --> 18:37.825
it's totally possible
that we've actually found

18:37.825 --> 18:40.661
a little bit more evidence that
maybe this part of the island

18:40.661 --> 18:42.788
was a staging point
for something else,

18:42.788 --> 18:45.624
and, potentially,
even the original works.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.585
In this fresh territory, we're
thinking this is potentially

18:48.585 --> 18:50.170
another game changer.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.713
(line ringing)

18:52.713 --> 18:55.174
Hey. I'm out here
with Gary and Alex.

18:55.174 --> 18:56.801
We found something
pretty interesting.

18:58.636 --> 19:00.596
We're on Lot 24.

19:03.141 --> 19:04.934
-Awesome.
-Okay, mate.

19:09.730 --> 19:10.857
RICK:
Hey, guys, where are you?

19:10.857 --> 19:12.025
Over here!

19:12.025 --> 19:13.693
NARRATOR:
 After discovering

19:13.693 --> 19:17.029
what could be
a significant new search site,

19:17.029 --> 19:19.700
Alex Lagina has asked
his uncle, Rick Lagina,

19:19.700 --> 19:22.827
to come and examine
the team's recent finds.

19:22.827 --> 19:25.372
ALEX:
We've got some good stuff here.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.708
Check this out.
We put 'em on a rock

19:27.708 --> 19:30.711
so that we could keep 'em...
separate.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.297
So, this all came out
of that hole right there.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.714
-Really?
-Yeah. This is

19:34.714 --> 19:36.215
what we were
originally digging for.

19:36.215 --> 19:38.093
-What looked like a...
-GARY: An old latch.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.720
...an old door latch
or something.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.056
RICK: It's a curious...
and eclectic number of finds.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.558
-I mean, that's
quite remarkable.
-Yeah.

19:45.558 --> 19:48.895
RICK: It's significant, because
 we've just been able to access

19:48.895 --> 19:50.897
the entirety of Lot 24

19:50.897 --> 19:53.901
by this mulching program
we've undertaken,

19:53.901 --> 19:56.444
and Gary can finally
get into these areas,

19:56.444 --> 19:59.906
which have been inaccessible
all these years. It's exciting.

19:59.906 --> 20:02.034
So we thought
we would stop digging here

20:02.034 --> 20:03.993
and maybe get Laird.

20:03.993 --> 20:06.078
-RICK: Yeah, I think
you did the right thing.
-Yeah.

20:06.078 --> 20:07.748
I think we need
to move off of here

20:07.748 --> 20:09.583
-Yeah.
-and let Laird render
an opinion.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.250
NARRATOR:
 Although the team would like

20:11.250 --> 20:15.047
to continue searching
for artifacts on Lot 24,

20:15.047 --> 20:17.048
they are required
by the province

20:17.048 --> 20:19.843
to suspend
further exploration of the area

20:19.843 --> 20:21.428
until they are joined

20:21.428 --> 20:24.556
by authorized archaeologist
Laird Niven.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.557
It'll be interesting
to see what Laird thinks.

20:26.557 --> 20:27.934
Yep. We'll bag it up.

(horn honks)

20:38.153 --> 20:39.904
Here it comes.

20:39.904 --> 20:43.991
RICK: Oh, yeah. That would be
the wash plant proper.

20:43.991 --> 20:47.621
...Rick Lagina joins
Craig Tester at Smith's Cove

20:47.621 --> 20:50.082
to supervise
the arrival of the new

20:50.082 --> 20:52.459
50-ton wash plant.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.961
It's a beast.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.755
RICK:
Yes, it is.

20:56.755 --> 20:59.967
Oh, my God, what an armada.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.469
What's different
about Smith's Cove

21:02.469 --> 21:04.471
is there's important
information there.

21:04.471 --> 21:07.974
We have to be able
to process this material

21:07.974 --> 21:10.143
as effectively and efficiently
as possible.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.605
Without this plant,
I think we're dead in the water.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.523
Hey, Billy.

21:15.523 --> 21:16.817
-How you doing?
-CRAIG: Good.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.402
RICK:
So, what's the plan?

21:18.402 --> 21:20.528
How do you intend
to lay this out?

21:20.528 --> 21:22.905
So, that truck will
pull in first,

21:22.905 --> 21:25.826
and we'll unload the conveyors
next, then the, the, uh,

21:25.826 --> 21:27.576
wash plant will come off last.

21:27.576 --> 21:29.121

Okay.

NARRATOR: For generations
 of treasure hunters,

21:33.290 --> 21:35.836
Smith's Cove has been
the starting place

21:35.836 --> 21:38.005
for the entire
Oak Island mystery.

21:38.005 --> 21:42.342
It is here that a baffling
network of stone box drains

21:42.342 --> 21:45.011
were discovered in 1850,

21:45.011 --> 21:48.347
and although their purpose
is still not entirely known,

21:48.347 --> 21:51.351
the box drains are believed
to be the entrance point

21:51.351 --> 21:53.353
for the ocean water that fuels

21:53.353 --> 21:55.646
the booby-trapped
flood tunnels.

21:55.646 --> 21:58.150
It is also
at Smith's Cove where

21:58.150 --> 22:01.193
Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton
made what is arguably

22:01.193 --> 22:04.239
one of the team's
most important discoveries,

22:04.239 --> 22:06.866
a lead cross.

22:06.866 --> 22:09.536
One that eerily
matches a carving

22:09.536 --> 22:11.203
that Rick found on the wall

22:11.203 --> 22:15.041
of a 14th century
Templar prison last year.

22:15.041 --> 22:18.878

the Templar cross.

important artifacts

22:24.634 --> 22:27.929
during their excavation
of Smith's Cove,

22:27.929 --> 22:30.807
then all of the hard work and
millions of dollars invested

22:30.807 --> 22:33.559
will have been worth it.

22:33.559 --> 22:34.644
Billy, how long do you think
it's gonna take

22:34.644 --> 22:36.063
to put this all together?

22:36.063 --> 22:38.397
I would think that this week
should put it all in place.

22:38.397 --> 22:41.567
Well, we'll see what
Smith's Cove has for us,

22:41.567 --> 22:43.653
whether it's gold or...

22:43.653 --> 22:45.864
-Yeah. What other hidden secrets
are in there, right?
-Yeah.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.116
It's exciting, but it's-it's
gonna be a lot of work.

22:49.116 --> 22:51.702
-It's a lot of work.
-A lot of work, but it's a...

22:51.702 --> 22:54.205
a good plan,
and-and just implement it

22:54.205 --> 22:55.414
-and get going.
-Yup.

22:55.414 --> 22:56.958
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.752
-Okay. Sounds good.
-We got our marching orders.

the massive wash plant
at Smith's Cove...

23:04.924 --> 23:08.595
JACK: I tend to believe
 the 90 Foot Stone has to be

23:08.595 --> 23:10.846
somewhere in Nova Scotia still.

23:10.846 --> 23:12.766
I still believe
it's out there somewhere.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.934
NARRATOR: Oak Island historians
 Doug Crowell

23:14.934 --> 23:16.936
and Charles Barkhouse,

23:16.936 --> 23:19.980
along with Jack Begley,
head to Halifax,

23:19.980 --> 23:22.442
back to the site
of the bookstore

23:22.442 --> 23:25.278
where the 90 Foot Stone
was last seen.

23:25.278 --> 23:28.448
It is now the home
of the Nova Scotia College

23:28.448 --> 23:29.950
of Art and Design,

23:29.950 --> 23:32.576
otherwise known as "NSCAD."

23:32.576 --> 23:35.038
Here's why the 90 Foot Stone
is so important

23:35.038 --> 23:36.288
to the Oak Island mystery.

23:36.288 --> 23:39.500
It was one of the earliest
artifacts described

23:39.500 --> 23:40.961
right from the beginning
of the hunt,

23:40.961 --> 23:44.213
and it stands as a message
of some kind

23:44.213 --> 23:46.007
from the original diggers.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.800
Exactly.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.345
So that's why it's important.
If we can find it

23:50.345 --> 23:53.306
and we can determine
what the characters really were,

23:53.306 --> 23:56.101
then it will help us
determine what message

23:56.101 --> 23:57.685
they were trying to impart.

23:57.685 --> 24:00.605
So we have a little bit
of a hunt on our hands today.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.148
Yeah.

24:02.148 --> 24:03.817
JACK: This is it
 right up here, right?

24:03.817 --> 24:04.901
DOUG:
 Yeah.

24:04.901 --> 24:06.903
CHARLES:
 Yes. Yes, it is.

24:08.113 --> 24:11.282
Where do you want to start?

24:11.282 --> 24:13.826
Go up and see Joe.
See this, Jack?

24:13.826 --> 24:15.619
This was the old bookbindery
right here.

24:15.619 --> 24:17.580
Yeah, right here. This is it.

24:17.580 --> 24:19.833
Well, this looks exactly
like the bookbindery picture

24:19.833 --> 24:21.041
that I saw.

24:21.041 --> 24:23.336
One of those two windows
is where the stone

24:23.336 --> 24:27.298
would have been displayed
back when it was a bookbindery.

24:27.298 --> 24:29.843
NARRATOR:
 According to reports,

24:29.843 --> 24:31.635
the so-called 90 Foot Stone

24:31.635 --> 24:35.848
was taken to the city
of Halifax in 1865,

24:35.848 --> 24:37.808
where it was put on display

24:37.808 --> 24:41.520
in the window of the Creighton
& Marshall's bookstore,

24:41.520 --> 24:42.855
in an effort to draw investors

24:42.855 --> 24:44.691
to the Oak Island
treasure hunt.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.526
But when the
combination bookstore

24:46.526 --> 24:49.988
and bookbindery closed in 1919,

24:49.988 --> 24:53.825
the stone seemed to vanish
without a trace.

24:55.701 --> 24:59.205
Well, let's get in there
and see what we can find.

24:59.205 --> 25:00.874
Hi, good to see you again.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.166
-Great to see you again.
-Yes.

25:02.166 --> 25:04.961
-Good to see you, Joe.
-Hey, Joe.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.547
-Well, here we are.
-Yes. Again.

25:07.547 --> 25:08.964
Yes.

25:08.964 --> 25:11.884
DOUG: As I was telling you on
the phone, you know, I just feel

25:11.884 --> 25:14.429
we haven't really explored
all of the basement.

25:14.429 --> 25:16.347
It's a real maze down there,
that's for sure.

25:16.347 --> 25:18.182
DOUG:
Yeah, it sure was,

25:18.182 --> 25:19.851
but we didn't find the stone.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.478
I'd really like
to get down there

25:21.478 --> 25:23.563
and explore and see if
we can get in under

25:23.563 --> 25:24.855
the actual bookbindery itself.

25:24.855 --> 25:26.398
Okay, well, let's have a look.

25:26.398 --> 25:29.402
-Awesome.
-Lead on.

25:29.402 --> 25:32.529
So, how big is, like,
the bookbindery?

25:32.529 --> 25:35.741
'Cause... did it
used to be much larger?

25:35.741 --> 25:38.244
No... it was about this size,

25:38.244 --> 25:40.413
but on the other side
of the building.

25:40.413 --> 25:43.916
Yeah, and it was back more
in line with the gray unit here.

25:43.916 --> 25:45.919
Well, why are we
going down here?

25:45.919 --> 25:48.630
Well, the basement-- entrance
to the basement starts here

25:48.630 --> 25:51.090
and then moves, uh, north.

25:51.090 --> 25:52.759
You'll see when we
get down there, Jack,

25:52.759 --> 25:54.385
it's really hard
to get your bearings.

25:54.385 --> 25:56.930
Like, you'll get disoriented
pretty quick.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.765
JACK: I think there is
 a really good chance

25:58.765 --> 26:01.433
that Doug's correct,
that the 90 Foot Stone

26:01.433 --> 26:04.270
is hidden somewhere at NSCAD.

26:04.270 --> 26:06.897
It's worth at least
a second try

26:06.897 --> 26:10.234
because to be able to bring
one of the major pieces

26:10.234 --> 26:12.569
of this puzzle
back to the island

26:12.569 --> 26:14.823
would be really rewarding.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.286
-DOUG: Ooh.
-JACK: Oh, this looks creepy.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.953
CHARLES:
What do we got here, Joe?

26:20.953 --> 26:24.290
We have a series of basements
underneath the, uh,

26:24.290 --> 26:27.961
where the bookbindery
would have been.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.837
So we're directly under
the bookbindery right now?

26:29.837 --> 26:32.173
Yes, that should,
this should be the space.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.465
We-we haven't been
in here before.

26:33.465 --> 26:35.134
No, this doesn't look
familiar at all.

26:35.134 --> 26:37.261
-No. No, this is a...
-I'm going down.

26:37.261 --> 26:38.721
-Shall we have a look, Jack?
-Yeah.

26:43.768 --> 26:46.520
OR: At the Nova Scotia
College of Art and Design

26:46.520 --> 26:47.814
in the city of Halifax...

26:47.814 --> 26:49.316
DOUG:
Oh, man, be careful.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.651
There's all kinds of stuff
all over the floor down here.

26:51.651 --> 26:53.778
...Jack Begley,
Charles Barkhouse,

26:53.778 --> 26:55.322
and Doug Crowell

26:55.322 --> 26:57.531
are exploring the basement
of the building

26:57.531 --> 27:00.410
where Oak Island's
infamous 90 Foot Stone

27:00.410 --> 27:04.455
was last seen
more than 100 years ago.

27:04.455 --> 27:06.124
JACK:
That's really creepy.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.667
Geez.

27:11.546 --> 27:14.173
JACK: This is
 a really gross basement.

27:14.173 --> 27:16.550
It's musty.
There's cobwebs everywhere.

27:16.550 --> 27:18.970
I mean everywhere--
covering the walls,

27:18.970 --> 27:19.929
covering everything.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.388
Oops.

27:21.388 --> 27:24.099
And there's a lot
of just forgotten stuff.

27:24.099 --> 27:26.853
I don't remember us
being in here at all.

27:26.853 --> 27:30.981
No. We weren't in any
crawl spaces like this.

27:30.981 --> 27:32.858
No, this is not familiar at all.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.822
There's a crawl space back here.

27:37.822 --> 27:42.035
There's a stone
back here, but...

27:42.035 --> 27:44.871
it's definitely not big enough.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.207
DOUG: That building seems
 to be ever-changing.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.875
We've been looking
through the basement,

27:48.875 --> 27:52.503
and again, there's new
additions, new partitions.

27:52.503 --> 27:55.548
It really is like a maze,
and we haven't found the spot

27:55.548 --> 27:57.509
I feel is directly under
the bookbindery yet,

27:57.509 --> 27:59.551
but, uh, we're gonna
keep looking.

28:01.971 --> 28:03.347
You see anything, Doug?

28:03.347 --> 28:05.849
No. Rock wall
and lots of old brick.

28:05.849 --> 28:07.684
This corner's kind of
interesting, though,

28:07.684 --> 28:10.020
'cause it looks like it
might've been open at one time.

28:11.564 --> 28:13.482
Yeah, there's a lot
of loose brick right there.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.071
There's a lot
of wires here, Charles.

28:19.071 --> 28:20.740
Just make sure
you don't come in contact

28:20.740 --> 28:22.826
-with a bare one or something.
-Oh, God. I know.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.580
Anything interesting, Jack?

28:28.580 --> 28:32.251
Yeah, there's a bunch
of spiderwebs over here.

28:32.251 --> 28:34.546
There's spiderwebs everywhere.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.423
There's junk everywhere.
You can tell

28:37.423 --> 28:39.592
no one's been down in this part
of the basement

28:39.592 --> 28:41.760
for a really, really long time.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.762
Hey, guys. You seeing
anything yet?

28:45.597 --> 28:47.433
-Watch out for rats.
-That's for sure.

28:47.433 --> 28:48.601
(creaking)

28:48.601 --> 28:50.185
What was that?

28:51.729 --> 28:55.023
(chittering)

28:56.442 --> 28:58.736
I think something
just crawled back there.

29:02.323 --> 29:06.869
NARRATOR: As Jack, Doug, and
 Charles continue their search

29:06.869 --> 29:08.454
for the 90 Foot Stone,

29:08.454 --> 29:11.583
Marty Lagina returns
to Oak Island,

29:11.583 --> 29:14.461
eager to get a first-hand look
at the team's progress

29:14.461 --> 29:15.920
while he was away.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.506
MARTY: All right, Rick,
 I've been gone a long time.

29:18.506 --> 29:19.590
What did you accomplish?

29:19.590 --> 29:21.634
Everything is in place
right now.

29:21.634 --> 29:24.471
MARTY:
 I'm just back on the island,

29:24.471 --> 29:25.762
and I'm very eager to see

29:25.762 --> 29:26.972
what's been accomplished
in Smith's Cove.

29:26.972 --> 29:29.017
The guys have done a lot
since I've been gone,

29:29.017 --> 29:31.102
so I want to put
my own eyes on it.

29:31.102 --> 29:33.438
MARTY: All right, well, I guess
things have changed here, Rick.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.772
-Whoa!
-Yup.

29:38.567 --> 29:40.487
MARTY:
 Whoa-ho-ho!

29:40.487 --> 29:42.279
-Wait till you see it.
-I do see it.

29:42.279 --> 29:44.156
No, no, you don't.

29:44.156 --> 29:45.616
-Wowzer, wowzer, wowzer.
-Not until you walk
in the crane pad

29:45.616 --> 29:47.993
-will you...
-No, that is really cool.

29:47.993 --> 29:49.828
'Cause we're at mid-tide.

29:49.828 --> 29:52.582
-Look at that.
-Mm-hmm.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.750
(chuckles):
Not since Moses has the water

29:54.750 --> 29:58.128
been held back so well.

29:58.128 --> 29:59.838
-Wait till you stand
up there, though.
-Very impressive.

29:59.838 --> 30:01.673
You'll not know the scope of it.

30:01.673 --> 30:03.843
Very impressive.

30:03.843 --> 30:06.637
I say we're ready to dig.

30:06.637 --> 30:09.516
We could hold off the pirates
with this thing.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.851
I knew the cofferdam
was gonna be a massive project,

30:11.851 --> 30:14.311
but when I came down that hill
and saw it,

30:14.311 --> 30:18.148
I really thought, "Wow,
that is quite a structure."

30:18.148 --> 30:22.987
And I know Rick did an enormous
amount of work to perfect it.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.905
It's very impressive.

30:33.705 --> 30:35.165
You know, when you get out here,

30:35.165 --> 30:36.542
it looks a lot bigger,
doesn't it?

30:36.542 --> 30:38.044
Back there it looks
like a small area.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.505
RICK:
Yeah.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.384
Just stand here.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.385
Stand here.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.638
Oh, yeah.

30:49.638 --> 30:52.392
-Water out there.
-Mm-hmm.

30:52.392 --> 30:55.060
MARTY:
Man, you've done a lot of work.

30:55.060 --> 30:57.855
Yep. We all have.

30:59.898 --> 31:01.901
MARTY:
This is gonna be fun,

31:01.901 --> 31:05.571
but it is going to dish up
a load of problems.

31:05.571 --> 31:07.198
RICK:
Problems are easily dealt with.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.659
It's the surprises and the finds

31:09.659 --> 31:12.244
and the story of what
that U-shaped structure is,

31:12.244 --> 31:13.621
what's underneath it,

31:13.621 --> 31:16.124
what we might find
in association with it.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.125
Every time
we do something out here,

31:18.125 --> 31:20.586
-it's amazing what
the people before us did.
-Mm-hmm.

31:20.586 --> 31:23.798
-'Cause they didn't have
any of this... these resources.
-Nope.

31:23.798 --> 31:27.551
NARRATOR:
 In the early 1970s,

31:27.551 --> 31:31.513
Oak Island resident and veteran
treasure hunter Dan Blankenship

31:31.513 --> 31:35.727
conducted his own large-scale
excavation of Smith's Cove.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.938
It was then,
while searching for evidence

31:38.938 --> 31:41.273
of the legendary
flood tunnel box drains,

31:41.273 --> 31:45.903
that Dan made an unusual
and astonishing find:

31:45.903 --> 31:49.240
a 65-foot-long
wooden U-shaped structure

31:49.240 --> 31:51.909
located some ten feet deep.

31:51.909 --> 31:56.705
And on it were carved a series
of Roman numerals.

31:56.705 --> 31:59.791
But before Dan
could carefully examine

31:59.791 --> 32:01.711
his mysterious new discovery,

32:01.711 --> 32:04.631
severe storms
destroyed the cofferdam

32:04.631 --> 32:07.467
and once again buried
the U-shaped structure.

32:07.467 --> 32:10.303
It hasn't been seen since.

32:10.303 --> 32:13.972
Quite a project
you got going here,

32:13.972 --> 32:15.474
big brother.

32:15.474 --> 32:19.186
We. We have a project, yes.

32:19.186 --> 32:22.356
NARRATOR: As Rick and Marty
 finish their inspection

32:22.356 --> 32:24.651
of the cofferdam
at Smith's Cove,

32:24.651 --> 32:28.488
some 50 miles northeast
of Oak Island...

32:28.488 --> 32:29.696
I think this crawl space
has been a catchall

32:29.696 --> 32:31.324
for things for decades.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.409
...Jack Begley,
Charles Barkhouse,

32:33.409 --> 32:35.994
and Doug Crowell
continue their search

32:35.994 --> 32:39.665
for evidence
of the so-called 90 Foot Stone.

32:39.665 --> 32:43.336
-Anything, Jack?
-Oh, I'm headed back over
towards you guys.

32:43.336 --> 32:46.631
I'm not seeing anything
except for just old junk.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.384
Lots of broken glass on the...
on the ground, too, guys.

32:52.552 --> 32:54.763
Oh, look at that, guys.

32:55.847 --> 32:58.351
I think we've got something
over here.

33:04.272 --> 33:06.192
What do you think that is?

33:10.238 --> 33:12.656
-JACK: Look at that.
-DOUG: Man, if that isn't close

33:12.656 --> 33:14.200
to two feet,
I don't know what is.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.786
JACK:
Does it have any markings on it?

33:28.338 --> 33:30.883
DOUG:
Oh, look.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.759
There's something carved there.

33:35.471 --> 33:38.057
It's a stone close
to the right dimensions.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.392
-Close your eyes, Jack.
-All right.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.560
(blows)

33:46.732 --> 33:49.527
There's a... there's a couple
of letters, by the looks of it.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.572
(blowing)

33:52.572 --> 33:57.242
Charles, it looks to me
like an L.N.

33:57.242 --> 34:00.413
-L.N.
-Charles, it's even got
rounded corners.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.749
There's no sharp corners
on this thing.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.666
CHARLES:
This may be the stone.

34:10.672 --> 34:12.007
CHARLES:
 Let's get this up on the deck.

34:12.007 --> 34:13.259
JACK:
All right.

34:13.259 --> 34:14.719
-DOUG: You ready?
Yep.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.929
I'm ready.

34:17.972 --> 34:20.641
CHARLES:
Here we go.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.478
RICK: The reason why
we actually did bring

34:23.478 --> 34:25.396
-a Cat rental unit here...
-Hi, guys.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.023
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.398
DAVE: What the hell
are you lugging in here now?

34:28.398 --> 34:29.858
CHARLES: We got
a little something to show you.

34:29.858 --> 34:31.443
MARTY: Wow.
It doesn't look very little.

34:31.443 --> 34:33.402
-DAVE: Little something?
-CHARLES: A little something.

34:33.402 --> 34:35.322
RICK: Looks like
a little heavy something.

34:35.322 --> 34:37.032
-MARTY: Heavy something.
-PAUL: That's a big something.

34:37.032 --> 34:39.367
-DOUG: Quite heavy.
-Whoa.

34:39.367 --> 34:42.204
Holy smokes.

34:42.204 --> 34:44.791
All right, we're ready.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.516
Can I touch it?

35:02.516 --> 35:05.393
-It's a smooth rock.
-(man laughs)

35:05.393 --> 35:08.356
-What am I supposed
to be seeing?
-CHARLES: Doug?

35:08.356 --> 35:10.900
Well, gentlemen,
this particular stone

35:10.900 --> 35:12.985
came from the bookbindery
in Halifax.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.447
It was in a crawl space

35:16.447 --> 35:19.951
in the NSCAD building right
where it was supposed to be,

35:19.951 --> 35:22.536
in my opinion,
because I do think

35:22.536 --> 35:24.621
that this is the stone
that Bowdoin saw

35:24.621 --> 35:25.831
in the bookbindery.

35:25.831 --> 35:28.333
The one... Wait a second.

35:28.333 --> 35:29.793
The 90 Foot Stone?

35:31.920 --> 35:35.007
The supposed 90 Foot Stone.

35:37.885 --> 35:39.512
Well, where's
all the inscriptions?

35:39.512 --> 35:41.054
-DAVE: There was writing on it.
-Right.

35:41.054 --> 35:43.682
Remember what Bowdoin wrote
about it in 1911.

35:43.682 --> 35:46.561
He wrote
that he had saw the stone,

35:46.561 --> 35:48.896
that the inscription
was worn off of it

35:48.896 --> 35:53.192
due to beating leather on it in
the book-- in the bookbindery.

35:53.192 --> 35:55.902
So supposedly the symbols
were worn off it.

35:55.902 --> 35:58.280
NARRATOR:
 In 1909,

35:58.280 --> 36:00.867
upon hearing reports
that the 90 Foot Stone

36:00.867 --> 36:03.869
was on display
in a Halifax bookstore,

36:03.869 --> 36:07.664
Oak Island treasure hunter
Captain Henry L. Bowdoin

36:07.664 --> 36:09.916
traveled there
to see it firsthand.

36:09.916 --> 36:13.628
He was hoping that,
by finding the original stone

36:13.628 --> 36:17.340
and carefully examining the
carved symbols and markings,

36:17.340 --> 36:19.719
he might be able to find clues
in the stone

36:19.719 --> 36:22.429
that had been
previously overlooked.

36:22.429 --> 36:27.601
Unfortunately, when he arrived,
he was horrified to discover

36:27.601 --> 36:29.811
that the stone was being used
as a slab

36:29.811 --> 36:31.981
for beating and cutting leather

36:31.981 --> 36:33.815
and that years
of repeated blows

36:33.815 --> 36:35.483
from the bookbinder's hammer

36:35.483 --> 36:37.612
had left the inscription
so damaged

36:37.612 --> 36:40.780
that it was
almost completely worn away.

36:40.780 --> 36:44.619
The only carvings on the stone
that Bowdoin could make out

36:44.619 --> 36:47.204
were the initials "L" and "N,"

36:47.204 --> 36:48.956
but nothing similar
to the symbols

36:48.956 --> 36:50.833
that had earlier been reported.

36:50.833 --> 36:53.418
Bowdoin left the bookbindery

36:53.418 --> 36:56.588
both disappointed
and empty-handed.

36:56.588 --> 36:59.717
How long between
when it was found,

36:59.717 --> 37:02.135
and how long was it beaten on
to get...

37:02.135 --> 37:03.429
Because it would take a lot
to get rid

37:03.429 --> 37:05.181
-of carvings.
-Yeah.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.807
The literature says
they weren't deeply carved...

37:07.807 --> 37:09.226
Mm-hmm.

37:09.226 --> 37:10.728
...even when they first found
the stone.

37:10.728 --> 37:14.190
-E-Etched or lightly engraved.
-Yeah.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.858
DOUG: But Bowdoin said
there were only two initials

37:16.858 --> 37:19.070
-left on it that he could see
at that time.
-MARTY: Mm-hmm.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.489
And if you look right there,
gentlemen,

37:21.489 --> 37:24.909
you'll see
two well-carved initials.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.786
MARTY:
L.N.? Is this an "L"?

37:27.786 --> 37:29.914
DOUG:
That's right.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.833
It has the appearance of a L.N.

37:32.833 --> 37:35.126
-RICK: That's interesting.
-DOUG: Yeah.

37:35.126 --> 37:38.505
-Well, sounds good so far.
-Yeah.

37:38.505 --> 37:41.050
The statement said
it was close to 200 pounds.

37:41.050 --> 37:43.260
I'm pretty sure it's close
to 200 pounds. Isn't it, Jack?

37:43.260 --> 37:45.429
The other things that he said

37:45.429 --> 37:46.722
in his statement about the stone

37:46.722 --> 37:49.141
was that it was flat
on two sides,

37:49.141 --> 37:51.059
that it had rounded corners,

37:51.059 --> 37:53.186
that it was
about ten inches thick,

37:53.186 --> 37:57.190
about 15 inches wide,
and about two feet long.

37:57.190 --> 38:00.027
The dimensions
are almost exactly.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.864
RICK:
Is it indigenous to Nova Scotia?

38:03.864 --> 38:06.574
If it's not,
that's very interesting.

38:06.574 --> 38:07.952
Because if you're gonna get
a replica,

38:07.952 --> 38:09.327
you're gonna get a stone,

38:09.327 --> 38:10.954
-a local stone.
-Exactly.

38:10.954 --> 38:12.873
MARTY:
 What they brought in

38:12.873 --> 38:15.583
fits a lot of the descriptions
of the stone.

38:15.583 --> 38:19.297
RICK: It checks all the boxes:
 same size, same dimension,

38:19.297 --> 38:20.715
same weight.

38:20.715 --> 38:25.844
There appear to be
some very faint carvings

38:25.844 --> 38:28.264
in the face of the stone.

38:28.264 --> 38:30.224
MARTY:
It could be the original stone.

38:30.224 --> 38:32.768
It could be
a huge breakthrough.

38:32.768 --> 38:35.353
It's exciting.
It's just the beginning.

38:35.353 --> 38:37.981
Okay, well, do you know
that in Stonehenge,

38:37.981 --> 38:40.735
just very recently,
they did some kind of laser?

38:40.735 --> 38:43.070
And they found
all kinds of ancient carvings

38:43.070 --> 38:44.530
that you can't see
with the naked eye.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.574
-Is that right?
-Mm-hmm.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.826
NARRATOR:
 In 2002,

38:48.826 --> 38:50.327
a team of researchers

38:50.327 --> 38:53.121
from Wessex Archaeology
and Archaeoptics

38:53.121 --> 38:55.041
in Salisbury, England,

38:55.041 --> 38:58.710
conducted a high-tech
examination of Stonehenge.

38:58.710 --> 39:01.713
Using high-resolution
laser scanners

39:01.713 --> 39:05.800
capable of recording details
as small as half a millimeter,

39:05.800 --> 39:08.429
they discovered
numerous carvings

39:08.429 --> 39:12.807
that had been impossible
to detect with the naked eye.

39:12.807 --> 39:15.518
Could this same technology

39:15.518 --> 39:17.980
allow the team
to recover markings

39:17.980 --> 39:19.940
on the suspected 90 Foot Stone

39:19.940 --> 39:23.777
that could help them find
the Oak Island treasure?

39:23.777 --> 39:25.195
MARTY:
 There are techniques

39:25.195 --> 39:27.697
used at Stonehenge
that can find carvings

39:27.697 --> 39:31.786
that have been obliterated.
You can see where they were.

39:31.786 --> 39:34.121
Look, we tracked down a stone
that was seen

39:34.121 --> 39:35.706
-almost 100 years ago.
-That's true.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.416
That's encouraging.

39:37.416 --> 39:39.668
This is a real mystery,

39:39.668 --> 39:41.920
and we're trying to apply
hard science to it

39:41.920 --> 39:44.715
and a real science
with real professionals,

39:44.715 --> 39:47.927
and I think this begets that.

39:47.927 --> 39:52.014
There is information out there.
We just have to find it.

39:52.014 --> 39:55.059
-Can we see
if we can have that done?
-Yeah, we need to.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.143
-That would be interesting.
-See if there's any remains?

39:57.143 --> 39:59.521
-DOUG:
Because there are so many marks.
-MARTY: Yeah.

39:59.521 --> 40:01.190
If that really is
the 90 Foot Stone,

40:01.190 --> 40:02.398
and if we can apply
some technology

40:02.398 --> 40:04.025
and actually see
the inscription,

40:04.025 --> 40:05.152
I'm gonna be pretty excited.

40:05.152 --> 40:07.153
And let's get Laird
to look at it.

40:07.153 --> 40:08.197
-Yes.
-RICK: Absolutely.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.614
Scanned over the top of this.

40:09.614 --> 40:10.865
RICK: No question about it,
and I would

40:10.865 --> 40:12.201
-like a geologist.
-DOUG: Yeah.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.827
RICK:
I think there's a consensus

40:13.827 --> 40:16.871
this is the stone
that was in the bookstore...

40:16.871 --> 40:18.791
MARTY: Which means it could be
the 90 Foot Stone.

40:18.791 --> 40:21.293
CHARLES:
 Oh, absolutely.

40:26.297 --> 40:27.800
NARRATOR:
 The next morning...

40:27.800 --> 40:29.592
RICK:
Let's take a look.

40:29.592 --> 40:32.096
...Rick Lagina and Craig Tester

40:32.096 --> 40:33.722
head to Smith's Cove.

40:33.722 --> 40:36.349
They are eager to see
if efforts to drain

40:36.349 --> 40:39.228
the newly enclosed area
have been successful.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.728
RICK:
All right.

40:40.728 --> 40:42.313
Cross your fingers.

40:42.313 --> 40:44.065
NARRATOR:
 Once dry,

40:44.065 --> 40:47.027
the team will be able
to safely excavate the cove

40:47.027 --> 40:51.614
in hopes of rediscovering the
mysterious U-shaped structure.

40:51.614 --> 40:54.409
CRAIG:
It doesn't look too bad.

40:54.409 --> 40:56.036
This is high tide, right?

40:56.036 --> 40:58.121
RICK:
This is high tide.

40:58.121 --> 41:00.875
Well, remember what it looked
like at low tide.

41:00.875 --> 41:04.210
CRAIG: Yeah.
It looks quite a bit the same.

41:04.210 --> 41:06.463
Oh, look at that.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.010
Right here, too.

41:16.389 --> 41:19.268
Pouring through there.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.228
NARRATOR: What Rick and Craig
 have noticed

41:21.228 --> 41:23.063
is not a good sign.

41:23.063 --> 41:26.650
Any leak, no matter how small,
will force the team

41:26.650 --> 41:30.195
to shut down the entire
Smith's Cove operation.

41:30.195 --> 41:32.280
That's not going to work.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.365
It seems like

41:34.365 --> 41:36.869
all the water's coming
in right there, doesn't it?

41:36.869 --> 41:40.581
Just those two alone
introduce a lot of water.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.500
That one's significant,
right there.

41:44.626 --> 41:48.172
We've got three major leaks.

41:48.172 --> 41:50.715
We see several locations
in the sheet pile works

41:50.715 --> 41:56.429
where water is literally flowing
in, uh, at a substantial rate.

41:58.014 --> 42:00.059
Almost all of them are leaking.

42:00.059 --> 42:02.228
If you look at where the
watermark is coming through.

42:04.813 --> 42:07.565
You can't be de-watering this
every single day.

42:07.565 --> 42:09.318
No, not that much.

42:09.318 --> 42:11.152
I expected some water coming in,

42:11.152 --> 42:13.322
-for sure, but...
-I didn't expect that.

42:13.322 --> 42:16.909
CRAIG:
No. No, that's pouring in there.

42:18.786 --> 42:21.496
NARRATOR: Finding what now
 appears to be several leaks

42:21.496 --> 42:24.208
in what was supposed to be
a watertight barrier

42:24.208 --> 42:26.501
is a devastating development

42:26.501 --> 42:29.338
for Rick, Marty,
and their partners.

42:29.338 --> 42:32.298
It could mean that,
after one year of planning

42:32.298 --> 42:35.219
and more than one million
dollars invested,

42:35.219 --> 42:40.306
the operation at Smith's Cove
is over before it begins.

42:40.306 --> 42:41.766
We're severely compromised

42:41.766 --> 42:44.603
if we fail to staunch
the incoming water.

42:44.603 --> 42:47.690
I mean, it's just,
it's... we can't proceed.

42:47.690 --> 42:50.608
You cannot do a dig
at the U-shaped structure

42:50.608 --> 42:52.235
and properly expose it.

42:52.235 --> 42:54.862
If we're chest-high
in liquid mud,

42:54.862 --> 42:56.572
it's just not gonna happen.

42:56.572 --> 42:58.284
But there certainly is
a significant problem

42:58.284 --> 43:00.286
at this point.

43:00.286 --> 43:02.413
It's a call.
We have to call Mike and see how

43:02.413 --> 43:03.789
-we can address this.
-Yeah.

43:03.789 --> 43:05.833
-We can't function like this.
-No.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.460
(wind gusting)

43:13.172 --> 43:15.217
NARRATOR: Shortly after
 the devastating discovery

43:15.217 --> 43:18.219
that the steel cofferdam
at Smith's Cove has developed

43:18.219 --> 43:20.472
a large number of leaks,

43:20.472 --> 43:24.018
Rick Lagina and his partner
Craig Tester

43:24.018 --> 43:26.061
have placed an emergency call
to representatives

43:26.061 --> 43:28.981
from Irving Equipment, Limited.

43:28.981 --> 43:30.356
MIKE J. (over phone):
Hello.

43:30.356 --> 43:31.483
RICK:
Hey, good morning, Mike.

43:31.483 --> 43:32.985
This is, uh, Rick and Craig.

43:35.195 --> 43:37.822
We did as you suggested. Uh,

43:37.822 --> 43:40.199
we did run the perimeter inside
and out, and there is...

43:40.199 --> 43:43.829
there's more than a few
of what we consider to be

43:43.829 --> 43:45.998
substantial leaks.

43:49.043 --> 43:52.420
Well, any kind of leaks,
there was over 30.

43:52.420 --> 43:57.217
Um, and more significant ones,
this is coming inward,

43:57.217 --> 43:59.177
there was, like, five or six,

43:59.177 --> 44:03.431
but that was what we could see
above the water level.

44:03.431 --> 44:05.893
We don't know how many were
below the water level.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.728
RICK:
The prime directive,

44:07.728 --> 44:11.606
as you well know, Mike, was
to get it as dry as possible.

44:11.606 --> 44:14.400
We can't be down there

44:14.400 --> 44:16.903
and, you know, dig ten feet deep

44:16.903 --> 44:19.364
and have water sloshing
around our hips.

44:19.364 --> 44:21.074
I mean, it just can't happen.

44:21.074 --> 44:22.867
Uh, we're wondering
if there's some way

44:22.867 --> 44:25.788
that, you know,
you can address that.

44:25.788 --> 44:27.873
It's the typical
emotional roller coaster ride

44:27.873 --> 44:29.625
on Oak Island, right?

44:29.625 --> 44:31.626
It's, it's, um,
beyond frustrating,

44:31.626 --> 44:33.253
beyond disappointing. It-it...

44:33.253 --> 44:34.922
But it just is,
and you have to deal with it,

44:34.922 --> 44:36.130
and you have to move on.

44:52.398 --> 44:54.065
NARRATOR:
 With applications

44:54.065 --> 44:56.275
ranging from common
home repairs

44:56.275 --> 44:59.070
to commercial construction
and manufacturing,

44:59.070 --> 45:03.242
silicone is a rubber-like
adhesive capable of creating

45:03.242 --> 45:04.909
a flexible bond.

45:04.909 --> 45:07.413
It is also highly resistant
to water,

45:07.413 --> 45:10.081
friction
and extreme temperatures.

45:26.139 --> 45:29.601
On the face of the lock,
not down the lock.

45:37.943 --> 45:39.610
Right.

45:54.835 --> 45:57.003
Well, we appreciate you
working with us, Mike.

45:57.003 --> 45:59.797
I mean, we're quite
inexperienced in this arena,

45:59.797 --> 46:03.217
so we're relying
on your expertise.

46:04.927 --> 46:06.346
-All right. Thank you, Mike.
-CRAIG: Thank you, Mike.

46:06.346 --> 46:07.389
-Take care, bye.
-MIKE J.: Thanks.

46:13.728 --> 46:15.981
NARRATOR:
 The next morning,

46:15.981 --> 46:18.567
Rick Lagina,
along with his nephews

46:18.567 --> 46:20.985
Alex Lagina and Peter Fornetti,

46:20.985 --> 46:23.655
join metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

46:23.655 --> 46:27.576
and archaeologist
Laird Niven on Lot 24.

46:27.576 --> 46:30.496
-Okay.
-Here we are.
-Here we are.

46:30.496 --> 46:34.373
So, this is what we found,

46:34.373 --> 46:37.418
and, uh, we had
a metal detector hit here

46:37.418 --> 46:40.047
and we started investigating,
looking for the metal object.

46:40.047 --> 46:41.507
-Yeah.
-Pretty soon we started seeing

46:41.507 --> 46:43.800
little chunks of other things
in the dirt

46:43.800 --> 46:46.094
that he had pulled out,
which is in this bag here.

46:46.094 --> 46:47.429
GARY: Every time I put
my hand in the hole,

46:47.429 --> 46:48.679
pulled it back out,

46:48.679 --> 46:50.349
there was something else
interesting

46:50.349 --> 46:52.141
-in the area.
-LAIRD: Okay. Yeah.

46:52.141 --> 46:53.936
ALEX: So, we've got a few
different kinds of pottery.

46:53.936 --> 46:55.853
GARY: Yeah, there's glazed
and unglazed pottery in there.

46:55.853 --> 46:58.898
Yeah. Yeah, so that's
hand-painted pearl ware.

46:58.898 --> 47:00.567
-So that's 1780s.
-ALEX: Okay.

47:00.567 --> 47:02.610
That's nice.
That's what we like to see.

47:02.610 --> 47:05.030
That's like a little bit earlier
than the other stuff

47:05.030 --> 47:06.864
-we've been seeing. Yeah.
-Yeah.

47:06.864 --> 47:09.451
And there's this metal object
that we ended up finding.

47:09.451 --> 47:11.494
I'm not sure exactly
what to make of that.

47:11.494 --> 47:15.373
-(clears throat)
-I thought that was probably
like a latch.

47:15.373 --> 47:18.043
LAIRD: Yeah, so it means
it's decorative iron, right?

47:18.043 --> 47:19.753
-It's been twisted.
-Yeah.

47:19.753 --> 47:22.005
So, this does make
your toes tingle?

47:22.005 --> 47:22.965
-Yeah, absolutely.
-(chuckling)

47:22.965 --> 47:24.715
(chuckles): It does. It does.

47:24.715 --> 47:28.262
NARRATOR: Although the ultimate
 goal of the Oak Island team

47:28.262 --> 47:32.139
is not to find pottery
and pieces of antique metal,

47:32.139 --> 47:34.768
they are hoping that,
by carefully searching for

47:34.768 --> 47:37.728
and examining
man-made artifacts,

47:37.728 --> 47:40.440
they can piece together
a virtual timeline

47:40.440 --> 47:42.525
of what might have happened
on Oak Island

47:42.525 --> 47:47.239
prior to the discovery
of the Money Pit in 1795.

47:47.239 --> 47:48.990
So far,

47:48.990 --> 47:52.244
the team has found evidence
not only of British

47:52.244 --> 47:55.539
but also French and Spanish
activity on Oak Island

47:55.539 --> 47:59.418
dating as far back
as the 17th century.

47:59.418 --> 48:01.753
-It's a variety of finds.
-Yeah.

48:01.753 --> 48:03.297
And that's
what made it interesting.

48:03.297 --> 48:06.090
And we can feel rocks in there.
So, who knows

48:06.090 --> 48:08.719
-what else is in the hole?
-RICK: I haven't explored

48:08.719 --> 48:11.637
that at all or put my hand down
there, but you're indicating

48:11.637 --> 48:14.181
-there's a substantial amount
of rock in there.
-Yeah.

48:14.181 --> 48:15.349
Why-why would that be?

48:15.349 --> 48:17.893
LAIRD:
It could, in theory, be a well.

48:17.893 --> 48:20.438
I mean, there's only one way to
find out-- is to delineate it.

48:20.438 --> 48:22.898
-RICK: I think we're all
intrigued enough to-to wonder

48:22.898 --> 48:25.110
-what else is down there.
-No, absolutely. I mean, it's...

48:25.110 --> 48:28.362
-it's seemingly
in the middle of nowhere.
-ALEX: Right, right.

48:28.362 --> 48:30.782
So, how-how would
you grid it out?

48:30.782 --> 48:33.784
LAIRD: I'd clean it off first,
and then we delineate

48:33.784 --> 48:36.329
a one-meter
by two-meter kind of grid.

48:36.329 --> 48:38.873
-Yeah.
-So why don't we--
why don't we do that very thing?

48:38.873 --> 48:41.293
-Okay.
-Do you want to stay here
and start this process?

48:41.293 --> 48:43.711
-LAIRD: Sure. Sounds good.
-ALEX: Cool.
-RICK: All right.

48:43.711 --> 48:44.880
-Yeah, mate. See you in a bit.
-All right.
-Good luck.

48:44.880 --> 48:46.297
All right. Thank you.

48:46.297 --> 48:51.594
RICK:
 Lead on, guys.

48:51.594 --> 48:53.804
RRATOR: While area
archaeologist, Laird Niven,

48:53.804 --> 48:59.186
begins to carefully excavate
the mysterious site on Lot 24,

48:59.186 --> 49:02.230
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina

49:02.230 --> 49:03.856
head to the war room,

49:03.856 --> 49:05.483
where they have called
an important meeting

49:05.483 --> 49:08.070
with members
of their Oak Island team.

49:08.070 --> 49:11.114
MARTY: Well, gents,
I have had the opportunity

49:11.114 --> 49:13.909
to make contact with
an incredibly well-credentialed

49:13.909 --> 49:16.161
person in the field of seismic
and actually

49:16.161 --> 49:17.244
a whole bunch of other stuff.

49:17.244 --> 49:18.914
His name is Travis Taylor.

49:18.914 --> 49:20.206
And to that end,

49:20.206 --> 49:21.666
Charles, hit the screen.

49:21.666 --> 49:23.376
Travis,

49:23.376 --> 49:25.336
uh, you are now in the war room.

49:25.336 --> 49:26.505
-Welcome.
-Wow, thanks.

49:26.505 --> 49:27.922
Nice to see you guys.

49:27.922 --> 49:29.215
Why don't you give 'em,
real briefly,

49:29.215 --> 49:30.550
what your background is.

49:30.550 --> 49:31.885
Right, okay.
Well, uh,

49:31.885 --> 49:34.679
I've worked
with the, uh, aerospace

49:34.679 --> 49:36.889
and-and defense industry
and the intelligence community

49:36.889 --> 49:39.851
for, you know, 25 years.

49:39.851 --> 49:41.853
Pretty much
since I was a teenager.

49:41.853 --> 49:45.356
NARRATOR: Dr. Travis Taylor
 is an astrophysicist

49:45.356 --> 49:48.527
and aerospace engineer
with degrees

49:48.527 --> 49:50.362
in the fields
of optical sciences,

49:50.362 --> 49:52.905
quantum physics, and astronomy.

49:52.905 --> 49:55.367
He has also spent
more than two decades

49:55.367 --> 49:57.952
working closely with
the United States government

49:57.952 --> 50:01.206
on numerous classified programs
for both NASA

50:01.206 --> 50:03.875
and the Department of Defense.

50:03.875 --> 50:06.711
So, uh,
I like to solve problems.

50:06.711 --> 50:08.130
Uh, in fact, that's what I do--

50:08.130 --> 50:10.548
is, uh, I find hard problems
and solve them and--

50:10.548 --> 50:11.800
or at least attempt to.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.260
-And...
-Well, you've found one.

50:13.260 --> 50:14.552
-(chuckling)
-TRAVIS: Yeah, this looks

50:14.552 --> 50:16.887
like a very interesting
conundrum. And, uh,

50:16.887 --> 50:19.224
I've kind of watched
what you guys have done,

50:19.224 --> 50:21.851
and I know you've done,
uh, one seismic test

50:21.851 --> 50:23.811
and some ground-penetrating
radar.

50:23.811 --> 50:25.646
RICK:
Yeah, we ran

50:25.646 --> 50:27.690
EM61s, we ran Megs,

50:27.690 --> 50:30.985
we ran, um... GPR.

50:30.985 --> 50:32.987
-Right.
-You know, we've had problems

50:32.987 --> 50:34.489
interpreting the data.

50:34.489 --> 50:36.157
Yeah. Not-not real happy
with the data.

50:36.157 --> 50:37.324
Okay.

50:37.324 --> 50:38.534
Ready to go?

50:38.534 --> 50:40.327
-Roger.
-Here it comes.

50:40.327 --> 50:41.579
NARRATOR:
 Earlier this year,

50:41.579 --> 50:43.248
the Laginas and their partners

50:43.248 --> 50:45.500
commissioned Eagle Canada,

50:45.500 --> 50:46.960
a geophysical
exploration company,

50:46.960 --> 50:49.755
to conduct
extensive seismic testing

50:49.755 --> 50:51.172
on Oak Island.

50:51.172 --> 50:54.342
The process involved
the detonation

50:54.342 --> 50:57.137
of more
than 1,500 dynamite charges,

50:57.137 --> 51:00.849
which sent shockwaves
deep into the earth.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.768
After these waves
were carefully

51:02.768 --> 51:03.976
recorded and measured...

51:03.976 --> 51:06.646
This anomaly here--
very interesting.

51:06.646 --> 51:09.106
...the team was presented
with a virtual map

51:09.106 --> 51:11.943
of possible tunnels,
chambers, and anomalies

51:11.943 --> 51:16.114
that might lie as much
as 200 feet deep underground.

51:16.114 --> 51:18.074
Is that consistent
with a chamber?

51:18.074 --> 51:20.242
-Yeah, it is.
-Wow.

51:20.242 --> 51:22.286
-Oh, whoa!
-CRAIG: Oh, that's
definitely vertical.

51:22.286 --> 51:24.414
Oh, that's a whole piece!

51:24.414 --> 51:27.208
I think you hit
the tunnel from Shaft Six.

51:27.208 --> 51:29.795
NARRATOR: Although the seismic
 maps have led the team

51:29.795 --> 51:33.047
to discover
incredible new evidence,

51:33.047 --> 51:35.050
the precise whereabouts
of the treasure vault

51:35.050 --> 51:37.010
remains a mystery.

51:37.010 --> 51:40.472
I mean, it's all been
valuable data, but...

51:40.472 --> 51:43.641
-but none of it has unlocked
the riddle like we wanted to.
-Not-- Right.

51:43.641 --> 51:45.811
-It's not yielded
the results that we sought.
-Yeah.

51:45.811 --> 51:48.103
It's all about information.
I was hoping we would get

51:48.103 --> 51:49.063
some relevant information.

51:49.063 --> 51:51.023
And it's not done yet,

51:51.023 --> 51:52.608
so that's the hope.

51:52.608 --> 51:54.485
MARTY:
We're kind of eager to know

51:54.485 --> 51:56.320
what you think you might be able
to help us with.

51:56.320 --> 52:00.157
Well, uh, I have worked
on a seismic program before.

52:00.157 --> 52:02.202
If I could get a look
at the seismic data

52:02.202 --> 52:03.829
that you guys have taken,

52:03.829 --> 52:06.456
maybe we can compile it and do
something called data fusion,

52:06.456 --> 52:08.166
where we use all the sensors
and compile

52:08.166 --> 52:10.460
that information together.
Sometimes

52:10.460 --> 52:12.503
it shows you something
that you don't realize is there.

52:12.503 --> 52:14.005
MARTY:
I'll tell you right now, I--

52:14.005 --> 52:15.215
if you're willing to help us,

52:15.215 --> 52:16.382
or at least try to help us,

52:16.382 --> 52:17.842
um, I don't see...

52:17.842 --> 52:19.760
We-We'd be foolish not to.

52:19.760 --> 52:22.681
Yeah. It's like bringing in
a team, with all his degrees.

52:22.681 --> 52:23.931
(laughter)

52:23.931 --> 52:26.601
Well, you know,
I can't promise anything,

52:26.601 --> 52:28.769
'cause it's possible that
there's nothing in the data,

52:28.769 --> 52:30.521
-right?
-Yeah, I understand.

52:30.521 --> 52:32.523
No, listen, I would have
discounted you right away

52:32.523 --> 52:34.233
if you promised me anything
on Oak Island.

52:34.233 --> 52:35.443
(laughter)

52:35.443 --> 52:37.362
Seismic has not worked so far,

52:37.362 --> 52:39.364
in terms of results,
but we hope

52:39.364 --> 52:40.699
to refine it,

52:40.699 --> 52:42.826
give it another go, and...

52:42.826 --> 52:44.077
you know, see if we can--

52:44.077 --> 52:45.871
-see if we can get something.
-Oh, yes.

52:45.871 --> 52:48.123
Okay, well, I think we--
I think we have a plan here.

52:48.123 --> 52:50.625
-TRAVIS: Okay.
-And we thank you
for wanting to be involved.

52:50.625 --> 52:52.626
Oh, well, I appreciate you guys
giving me the opportunity,

52:52.626 --> 52:54.920
-and maybe we can find
something.
-Yep. Perfect.

52:54.920 --> 52:56.255
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

52:56.255 --> 52:58.884
-See you guys.
-MARTY: Thank you. Bye.
-RICK: Bye.

52:58.884 --> 53:02.094
Well, that's great. Um, you
know, look forward to the data.

53:02.094 --> 53:03.889
But, um, let's get back to work.

53:03.889 --> 53:05.514
Yeah.

53:05.514 --> 53:08.351
NARRATOR: Following his meeting
 in the war room...

53:08.351 --> 53:11.103
-RICK:
 Hope he's found something.
-PETER: Yeah.

53:11.103 --> 53:13.106
...Rick Lagina and his nephew,
Peter Fornetti,

53:13.106 --> 53:15.733
return to Lot 24.

53:18.068 --> 53:19.487
RICK:
You've been busy.

53:19.487 --> 53:21.530
Hey. Yeah.

53:21.530 --> 53:22.949
How's the process coming?

53:22.949 --> 53:25.076
Well, lots of rocks.

53:26.161 --> 53:28.454
RICK:
Does it go that way

53:28.454 --> 53:31.081
-or does it end?
-I ended at the trees.

53:31.081 --> 53:34.753
Goes further that way,
and there's a rock...

53:34.753 --> 53:36.588
just in here. There.

53:36.588 --> 53:38.632
So you can see
the higher area here

53:38.632 --> 53:41.300
was filled in,
and then the artifacts

53:41.300 --> 53:43.677
we were finding
are from the later occupation.

53:43.677 --> 53:45.429
RICK:
What is it telling you?

53:46.972 --> 53:48.807
LAIRD:
Well, I think the fact that

53:48.807 --> 53:51.936
you found artifacts means
that humans

53:51.936 --> 53:53.313
were probably occupying
this place.

53:53.313 --> 53:56.358
The larger stones
could be structural.

53:56.358 --> 53:59.485
The smaller stones
could be fill.

53:59.485 --> 54:02.947
So, it could be a shaft
or a tunnel that was filled in.

54:04.532 --> 54:07.034
NARRATOR:
 A shaft or tunnel?

54:07.034 --> 54:10.413
Could the team have found
what was once the entrance

54:10.413 --> 54:14.000
to secret man-made workings
underground?

54:14.000 --> 54:18.963
But, if so, who built it
and for what purpose?

54:18.963 --> 54:21.967
RICK: We're always looking
for clues, you know, about

54:21.967 --> 54:24.802
underground work having been
done on this end of the island.

54:24.802 --> 54:29.224
There's Dan's belief
and Fred's long-held belief

54:29.224 --> 54:31.059
-that there was
extensive work done here.
-LAIRD: Right.

54:31.059 --> 54:32.978
Right.

54:32.978 --> 54:35.688
RICK: One of the rare times that
 Dan Blankenship and Fred Nolan

54:35.688 --> 54:38.190
were able to agree
on something,

54:38.190 --> 54:39.733
they agreed on this:

54:39.733 --> 54:43.737
that the underground workings
were very complex

54:43.737 --> 54:45.699
and they were not limited
to the Money Pit.

54:45.699 --> 54:48.326
They extended
into the western drumlin.

54:48.326 --> 54:51.829
Here we now have Laird
indicating there is

54:51.829 --> 54:54.748
a possibility that there's
an underground structure

54:54.748 --> 54:58.128
here on the western drumlin.
I mean,

54:58.128 --> 55:01.422
that's what we're looking for,
tunnels under Oak Island.

55:01.422 --> 55:04.175
How would you approach it?
If we wanted

55:04.175 --> 55:06.510
to explore this further,
i.e., deeper...

55:06.510 --> 55:07.762
-Mm-hmm.
-how would we

55:07.762 --> 55:09.931
go about that process
to see if it is

55:09.931 --> 55:11.849
a-a shaft or a tunnel?

55:11.849 --> 55:14.226
LAIRD: Probably try
to section it. That way,

55:14.226 --> 55:16.603
we can see
the stratigraphy vertically.

55:16.603 --> 55:19.273
And then proceed to record
and remove the rocks.

55:19.273 --> 55:20.525
RICK:
I see.

55:20.525 --> 55:21.985
So, right now,

55:21.985 --> 55:23.777
-you're intrigued.
-Oh, absolutely.

55:23.777 --> 55:25.612
PETER: So, the next step
is sending that off to get

55:25.612 --> 55:26.822
-the permitting?
-Yeah,

55:26.822 --> 55:28.032
-before you explore it
fur-further.
-Mm-hmm.

55:28.032 --> 55:29.784
Yeah, I apply
for another permit.

55:29.784 --> 55:32.077
RICK:
When Laird indicates to us that

55:32.077 --> 55:33.538
he feels this is important,

55:33.538 --> 55:36.623
that it needs to be
under his supervision,

55:36.623 --> 55:38.043
that's a good thing,

55:38.043 --> 55:40.295
because there's something
going on here.

55:40.295 --> 55:43.172
What it is,
it's too early to say.

55:43.172 --> 55:45.340
This could be
a significant find.

55:45.340 --> 55:48.052
Yeah. It's certainly starting
off with more promise

55:48.052 --> 55:51.181
than-than last year.

55:51.181 --> 55:53.557
(wind blowing)

55:55.851 --> 56:01.231
NARRATOR: After the discovery of
 a possible tunnel on Lot 24...

56:01.231 --> 56:02.900
-Hey, guys.
-Hello, Marty!
-Hey.

56:02.900 --> 56:04.652
...Rick and Marty Lagina,

56:04.652 --> 56:06.820
along with other members
of the Oak Island team,

56:06.820 --> 56:09.199
gather at the Mug
and Anchor Pub

56:09.199 --> 56:11.534
in nearby Mahone Bay.

56:11.534 --> 56:14.829
RICK: So, the update is,
Laird explored the Lot 24 area.

56:14.829 --> 56:16.371
He dug a site about--

56:16.371 --> 56:17.831
it's about the size
of two tables.

56:17.831 --> 56:22.003
And there's a substantial amount
of rock in the hole.

56:22.003 --> 56:24.672
The majority of them
appear to be

56:24.672 --> 56:27.132
laid or perhaps placed there.

56:27.132 --> 56:29.427
And because
of what he has found,

56:29.427 --> 56:30.887
he feels it's a-a tunnel.

56:33.097 --> 56:34.766
MARTY:
A tunnel? To what?

56:34.766 --> 56:36.309
RICK:
Well, we don't know yet.

56:36.309 --> 56:37.476
But everything is good.

56:37.476 --> 56:39.771
He will be back next week
to continue that dig,

56:39.771 --> 56:41.773
and hopefully
we'll get some answers.

56:41.773 --> 56:43.775
MARTY:
Well, if it gets

56:43.775 --> 56:46.110
an archaeologist's attention,
it's clearly significant.

56:46.110 --> 56:47.445
GARY:
And if those guys

56:47.445 --> 56:50.030
hadn't have cleared
that track down there,

56:50.030 --> 56:51.782
we would never have found that.

56:51.782 --> 56:55.786
And we're finding new areas
on Oak Island,

56:55.786 --> 56:59.541
undiscovered areas,
because of the clearing.

56:59.541 --> 57:01.291
It certainly has opened up
the lots that you were--

57:01.291 --> 57:03.795
-that were inaccessible before.
-And I haven't

57:03.795 --> 57:07.965
finished yet. We have got
a lot of area to cover still.

57:07.965 --> 57:08.967
Okay. Well, good.

57:08.967 --> 57:10.385
Keep it coming.

57:10.385 --> 57:11.385
Yeah.

57:11.385 --> 57:13.387
MARTY:
 This is a previously unknown,

57:13.387 --> 57:16.431
ancient-- in the sense of at
least several hundred-year-old--

57:16.431 --> 57:18.309
structure on Oak Island

57:18.309 --> 57:20.353
that might be
archaeologically significant.

57:20.353 --> 57:22.771
And the reason I say that
is because Laird thinks

57:22.771 --> 57:24.858
it's archaeologically
significant.

57:24.858 --> 57:28.610
His conjecture is that it
could be a tunnel of some sort.

57:28.610 --> 57:30.195
So, he's going
to investigate it the way

57:30.195 --> 57:32.824
archaeologists do--
that means with a trowel.

57:32.824 --> 57:35.827
Uh, so it's gonna be a while
before we have answers there.

57:35.827 --> 57:37.244
RICK: So, new information
coming every day.

57:37.244 --> 57:38.829
MARTY:
Good.

57:38.829 --> 57:41.456
One of these discoveries
is gonna be a breakthrough.

57:41.456 --> 57:42.583
Yeah.

57:42.583 --> 57:44.251
Thank you for the news, guys.

57:44.251 --> 57:46.461
-To the hunt!
-(clinking)
-GARY: Cheers!

57:49.507 --> 57:52.844
NARRATOR:
 With a new day ahead of them,

57:52.844 --> 57:56.639
Alex Lagina and Peter Fornetti
begin the process

57:56.639 --> 58:00.601
of patching the massive steel
cofferdam at Smith's Cove.

58:00.601 --> 58:03.730
Because the silicone-based
caulking compound

58:03.730 --> 58:06.023
must be applied
on the ocean side

58:06.023 --> 58:08.860
of the wall, Alex
and Peter need to work quickly

58:08.860 --> 58:11.862
while the tide is low.

58:11.862 --> 58:14.114
All right, Peter,

58:14.114 --> 58:16.784
according to Uncle Rick, this is
leaking pretty bad out here.

58:16.784 --> 58:19.204
So we're gonna go around
and caulk up all the seams here.

58:19.204 --> 58:21.581
Maybe seal 'em off
a little bit better

58:21.581 --> 58:23.248
and keep it a little dryer
in there.

58:23.248 --> 58:25.210
All right.

58:25.210 --> 58:27.211
I guess

58:27.211 --> 58:29.297
if it looks inadequate,
then we'll hit it.

58:29.297 --> 58:31.423
-PETER: Yep.
-'Cause we don't have
a lot of time out here.

58:31.423 --> 58:34.092
I think most of it
is probably underground, but...

58:34.092 --> 58:35.929
-The seepage?
-Yeah, but anything we can do

58:35.929 --> 58:37.304
to slow it down is gonna help.

58:37.304 --> 58:39.556
NARRATOR:
 As Alex and Peter

58:39.556 --> 58:42.351
continue caulking
the steel cofferdam...

58:42.351 --> 58:45.063
MARTY:
 Guys, I'm very pleased

58:45.063 --> 58:46.981
to have Travis Taylor
with us today.

58:46.981 --> 58:48.440
...brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,

58:48.440 --> 58:50.568
along with their partner
Craig Tester

58:50.568 --> 58:54.155
and other members of
their Oak Island team, welcome

58:54.155 --> 58:56.824
aerospace engineer
Dr. Travis Taylor

58:56.824 --> 58:58.952
to the war room.
He has come

58:58.952 --> 59:01.161
to present his findings
after reviewing

59:01.161 --> 59:03.039
the underground seismic data

59:03.039 --> 59:05.458
the team received
earlier this year.

59:05.458 --> 59:08.460
So you've done
some investigative work,

59:08.460 --> 59:10.505
-and you have some stuff
to show us, I understand.
-TRAVIS: Yeah, I do.

59:10.505 --> 59:14.509
So, to start with, I'll, uh,
show you the analysis.

59:14.509 --> 59:17.929
Now, uh, the seismic data
that you guys sent me,

59:17.929 --> 59:20.556
there was a lot of it that was
kind of much ado about nothing.

59:20.556 --> 59:25.269
Uh, so then I did some more
post-processing

59:25.269 --> 59:28.021
on the data specifically
through the Money Pit area here,

59:28.021 --> 59:30.483
and you can see clear anomalies

59:30.483 --> 59:32.527
between 20 and 30 meters
of depth.

59:33.485 --> 59:35.028
RICK:
When you say "clear anomaly,"

59:35.028 --> 59:38.324
are you indicating vertical
structures?

59:38.324 --> 59:42.286
Uh, there are, uh, vertical
striations in all of it,

59:42.286 --> 59:44.496
uh, which suggests to me

59:44.496 --> 59:47.208
that there might be some shafts
or voids

59:47.208 --> 59:50.043
that are vertical along places.

59:50.043 --> 59:54.298
CRAIG: When you say voids,
are you meaning an open area,

59:54.298 --> 59:57.552
or just a density contrast from
a hard rock to, you know,

59:57.552 --> 59:59.804
water, air,
or maybe just soft material?

59:59.804 --> 01:00:02.806
TRAVIS: Yeah, so, from the data,
all I can really say is

01:00:02.806 --> 01:00:06.311
it was a-a complete, uh,
opposite in densities.

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:07.978
-Okay.
-Right.

01:00:07.978 --> 01:00:09.521
So I-I don't know
if it was granite

01:00:09.521 --> 01:00:11.315
-or if it was empty, right?
-Right.

01:00:11.315 --> 01:00:12.817
There's clearly something there.

01:00:12.817 --> 01:00:14.527
-Mm-hmm.
-But all I can say is,

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:17.989
it's an anomaly in the density
of the material, right?

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:20.782
This anomaly here,
very interesting.

01:00:20.782 --> 01:00:22.909
Is that consistent
with a chamber?

01:00:22.909 --> 01:00:25.038
-Yeah. It is.
-Wow.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:28.498
NARRATOR: Because seismic
scanning detected what appeared

01:00:28.498 --> 01:00:31.460
to be a mysterious
underground chamber

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:35.380
located some 50 feet deep in
the so-called mega-bin area,

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:36.840
the team employed
sonic drilling

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.010
in an effort to find it.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:40.302
I think I'm gonna have
to operate, Craig.

01:00:40.302 --> 01:00:42.012
NARRATOR:
 Unfortunately,

01:00:42.012 --> 01:00:44.474
what everyone had hoped
was a man-made chamber

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:49.103
turned out to be nothing more
than a thick layer of sand.

01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:51.856
TERRY: Oh, yeah.
It's just sandy till.

01:00:51.856 --> 01:00:54.400
CRAIG: To me,
from a seismic standpoint,

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.777
this may be the anomaly
they were seeing.

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:02.909
At this point, it's no longer
science; it's an art.

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:06.204
And the artistry of seismic is
the interpretive.

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:08.539
It's a-a talent
and quite unique.

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:12.293
All right, so this is a-an idea
that I had

01:01:12.293 --> 01:01:15.588
on how you might could search
the island

01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:17.840
for voids, uh, underground.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.217
I mean, if you look
at this chart,

01:01:20.217 --> 01:01:24.222
there's a lot of uranium that's
found very close to the island.

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:27.516
Now, the key to that is,
when uranium decays,

01:01:27.516 --> 01:01:30.311
you get a bunch of products
from it.

01:01:30.311 --> 01:01:32.146
And radon is specifically
the one.

01:01:32.146 --> 01:01:35.483
This is a way that we find
uranium on the moon,

01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:38.860
and we've found it on Mars--
is looking for radon gas.

01:01:40.153 --> 01:01:42.949
NARRATOR
 Radon is a radioactive gas.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:46.244
It forms in trace amounts
when deposits of uranium,

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:48.788
which is naturally found
in rocks and soil,

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:51.081
breaks down underground.

01:01:51.081 --> 01:01:53.458
In recent years,
radon detection

01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:55.503
has been used experimentally

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:58.130
as a way to map
subsurface features

01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:00.425
in the energy and mining
industries.

01:02:01.967 --> 01:02:03.760
TRAVIS: Well, the idea is,
if you have a void,

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.097
uh, under-underneath
the surface,

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:08.641
over time, the uranium
is gonna cause this to, uh,

01:02:08.641 --> 01:02:10.268
fill with radon gas,

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:11.768
especially if there's no
ventilation in it, and...

01:02:11.768 --> 01:02:13.688
This would occur in a
fluid-filled cavity, too?

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:15.356
Oh, absolutely.
It-- Actually,

01:02:15.356 --> 01:02:17.315
radon is soluble
in most materials.

01:02:17.315 --> 01:02:19.025
MARTY:
 I think what we've learned

01:02:19.025 --> 01:02:20.695
is that seismic
isn't gonna work

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:23.530
in the Money Pit area;
it's too jumbled up.

01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:26.284
I always love when somebody
thinks of something

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:28.369
that had just
never occurred to me.

01:02:28.369 --> 01:02:30.413
That's the best kind
of information there is.

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.998
And so, Travis Taylor came in
with a whole new perspective

01:02:32.998 --> 01:02:36.710
on maybe how to find cavities
through radon testing,

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.211
and I don't know if we're gonna
have time for that this year

01:02:38.211 --> 01:02:40.130
or not, but I'd like
to pursue that.

01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:42.884
So, uh, as I started doing this,

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:45.094
I started reading more
about Oak Island

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:47.597
and-and looking at, uh,
what it's all about,

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:50.766
uh, I-I came up with sort of
my own theory

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:52.643
as to what may
have happened here.

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:55.228
Almost everybody
that's been involved

01:02:55.228 --> 01:02:57.690
in investigating it
are Freemasons.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:59.650
-Mm-hmm.
-Exactly.

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:02.652
NARRATOR
Beginning with Daniel McGinnis,

01:03:02.652 --> 01:03:06.490
the man who first discovered
the Money Pit in 1795,

01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:09.202
the ancient fraternity
of master builders

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:12.413
known as Freemasons
have played a large role

01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:14.623
in the Oak Island
treasure story.

01:03:14.623 --> 01:03:18.710
Prominent Masonic symbols,
such as the letter "G,"

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:21.255
which represents
the "Grand Architect,"

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:23.507
as well as the triangle
or pyramid,

01:03:23.507 --> 01:03:25.842
have been found
on numerous carvings,

01:03:25.842 --> 01:03:28.304
both in and around the island.

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:33.016
TRAVIS: So, I started looking
into the Freemasons,

01:03:33.016 --> 01:03:35.393
and, uh, one of the first things
that jumped out at me

01:03:35.393 --> 01:03:38.898
was, uh, Hiram Abiff's
Freemason Drawing Template.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.815
There are actually meanings
on this map

01:03:40.815 --> 01:03:42.610
that are based on astronomy.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:46.239
NARRATOR: According to the
 teachings of Freemasonry,

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:49.282
Hiram Abiff
was the chief architect

01:03:49.282 --> 01:03:52.244
of King Solomon's Temple
in ancient Jerusalem.

01:03:52.244 --> 01:03:54.539
His so-called
"drawing template"

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:56.541
is presented
to all Freemasons

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:59.710
who join the order's third
and highest degree.

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:03.213
It depicts many well-known
sacred images,

01:04:03.213 --> 01:04:06.759
such as Jacob's Ladder
to the heavens,

01:04:06.759 --> 01:04:09.052
and the Holy Grail.

01:04:10.887 --> 01:04:15.141
So, if you continue to look at
this, uh, drawing table,

01:04:15.141 --> 01:04:16.726
you see at the top,

01:04:16.726 --> 01:04:19.605
the Hand of God is holding
a chalice,

01:04:19.605 --> 01:04:22.148
or the Holy Grail
or the Cup of Life.

01:04:22.148 --> 01:04:25.735
But what the Freemasons
used that as a symbol of

01:04:25.735 --> 01:04:27.697
is "as above, so below."

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:30.407
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

01:04:30.407 --> 01:04:33.244
And you can, you can use that
metaphorical or whatever,

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:37.248
but if you use it literal, then
the way they would draw maps

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:40.166
is by "as above, so below."

01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:42.003
The stars would be their guide

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:45.172
on how they created the map,
if they were gonna make one.

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.465
The star on the upper right
is actually-- if you count,

01:04:47.465 --> 01:04:49.302
there are seven stars there.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:52.471
It looks like the Pleiades,
which is part of Taurus.

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:54.097
I got to thinking,
is there something

01:04:54.097 --> 01:04:56.809
that archaeoastronomy might have
to do with the island?

01:04:56.809 --> 01:05:01.355
So I overlaid the constellation
on-on the island.

01:05:01.355 --> 01:05:06.610
What we have are all of the
stars aligned onto the island,

01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:10.614
and then we have the Pleiades
somewhere between the beach

01:05:10.614 --> 01:05:14.952
and Frog Island,
and the point-star where that,

01:05:14.952 --> 01:05:16.911
where this piece would be,

01:05:16.911 --> 01:05:19.706
actually overlays perfectly
on Apple Island.

01:05:19.706 --> 01:05:22.126
This is a star map.

01:05:22.126 --> 01:05:24.295
NARRATOR:
 A star map?

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:27.088
One matching the constellation
Taurus to points,

01:05:27.088 --> 01:05:31.177
not only on Oak Island,
but two neighboring islands?

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:34.472
But, if so,
to what does it lead?

01:05:35.889 --> 01:05:38.476
What it also suggests to me
is that we should see

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:41.311
if there might be points
of interest

01:05:41.311 --> 01:05:43.981
where the stars are
from the constellation.

01:05:43.981 --> 01:05:45.690
If we follow the right
procedure,

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:47.985
we might be led to the point

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:51.155
on Oak Island where
the actual treasure is.

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:57.452
So you think
there's something here?

01:05:57.452 --> 01:06:01.916
You know, there's too much
history to it.

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:04.668
There's too much
anecdotal clues.

01:06:04.668 --> 01:06:08.255
Somebody was
doing something here.

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:10.548
But what?
You know, I don't know.

01:06:10.548 --> 01:06:14.344
What the hell was all
the works on Apple Island?

01:06:14.344 --> 01:06:18.014
Well, it might be
a starting point.

01:06:19.432 --> 01:06:21.101
It could be that

01:06:21.101 --> 01:06:23.228
there's a clue there
that tells you how to start.

01:06:23.228 --> 01:06:25.188
That could be where the key is.

01:06:25.188 --> 01:06:27.692
A trail of information.

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:29.693
Absolutely. Right.

01:06:29.693 --> 01:06:32.905
RICK: I don't know what to make
 of the possible connection

01:06:32.905 --> 01:06:34.864
between Oak Island
and Apple Island.

01:06:34.864 --> 01:06:36.992
What does that mean?
I don't know.

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:39.619
Is it a potential target zone?
Absolutely.

01:06:39.619 --> 01:06:41.121
There's a lot more that needs
to be done on that

01:06:41.121 --> 01:06:43.123
if we are gonna pursue it.

01:06:43.123 --> 01:06:44.958
Travis, thank you very much
for all of this data.

01:06:44.958 --> 01:06:46.626
I mean, very interesting.

01:06:46.626 --> 01:06:48.253
-Yeah, I've enjoyed it. Thanks.
-So let's do this, Travis.

01:06:48.253 --> 01:06:50.547
Um, Gary,
if you're available, Jack,

01:06:50.547 --> 01:06:53.050
let's take Travis, and we'll
show you around the island.

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:54.885
-So, let's go have a look.
-Oh, that sounds great.

01:07:00.474 --> 01:07:03.101
ATOR: Following the team's
 informative meeting

01:07:03.101 --> 01:07:04.728
in the Oak Island war room,

01:07:04.728 --> 01:07:09.275
Marty Lagina, Jack Begley
and Gary Drayton

01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:11.693
take Dr. Travis Taylor over
to Lot 2,

01:07:11.693 --> 01:07:14.447
located on the western side
of the island.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:18.409
Travis, why don't we check out
your first target spot?

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:19.952
-Right here. Right, Jack?
-Okay.

01:07:19.952 --> 01:07:22.204
Y-You have a better idea
of where Lot 1

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.331
-and 2 meet, do you not?
-Yeah.

01:07:24.331 --> 01:07:26.083
Yeah, just a little bit further.

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:28.835
NARRATOR: They are eager
 to investigate

01:07:28.835 --> 01:07:31.045
various points on the island

01:07:31.045 --> 01:07:33.798
that are indicated on what
Travis believes to be

01:07:33.798 --> 01:07:36.469
a massive star map.

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:39.387
A map which may point
to important clues

01:07:39.387 --> 01:07:41.681
that could help the team solve

01:07:41.681 --> 01:07:44.018
the Oak Island
treasure mystery.

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.353
So which way is it?

01:07:46.353 --> 01:07:49.148
-Follow him.
-Well, based upon your map,

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:51.608
Travis, you can very lightly see
the lot lines.

01:07:51.608 --> 01:07:55.112
And it looks like the first star
would be located

01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:57.739
near the lot line
between 3 and 2.

01:07:57.739 --> 01:07:58.824
-Lead on, maestro.
-All right.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.619
So, how do you know where
the lot line is?

01:08:02.619 --> 01:08:05.831
-Is there a marker?
-Stone walls.

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:07.416
MARTY:
 Travis Taylor is a bright guy.

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:09.793
He's a physicist
in many disciplines.

01:08:09.793 --> 01:08:12.755
So when you add all that up,
he might be able

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:16.466
to bring a new perspective to
the hunt here on Oak Island.

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:19.136
Watch yourself here, mate.

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:24.015
We're getting into the deep part
of the lot.

01:08:24.015 --> 01:08:25.600
JACK:
That rock wall right there,

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.353
that's the border
of Lot 2 and 3,

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:30.689
so it should be just on
the other side of that.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:34.819
All right, it looks like we've
reached the destination

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.488
that you pointed out
on your map.

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:40.240
TRAVIS: Wow. With the moss, and
the mulch, and the underbrush,

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.618
it's real hard
to see anything, right?

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:43.911
On the map
you've created for us,

01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:45.578
this is just a relative idea.

01:08:45.578 --> 01:08:48.082
-At least a hundred-foot
air bar radius.
-Okay.

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:50.125
I'd say anything...

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:53.627
So... there's a huge boulder
over here.

01:08:53.627 --> 01:08:56.631
JACK:
It could be a landmark.

01:08:56.631 --> 01:08:58.341
-Well, we should look
at it, right?
-Yeah.

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:02.930
This is a big rock.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.890
JACK:
That is a pretty big boulder.

01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:09.019
MARTY: This boulder is actually
pretty close to your spot.

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:12.604
JACK:
I don't see any other

01:09:12.604 --> 01:09:14.108
large boulders like this
around here.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:16.277
TRAVIS:
Not just s-sitting there, right?

01:09:16.277 --> 01:09:18.904
Well, that's interesting.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:21.407
Yeah, the first point
that we came to,

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:23.448
there's a large boulder at.

01:09:23.448 --> 01:09:25.327
That is intriguing.

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:27.578
GARY: So, we'll see if there's
a pattern develops

01:09:27.578 --> 01:09:29.832
-when we go to the next place.
-Yeah, right?

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.917
-Right. Let's go do that.
-TRAVIS: All right,
let's do that.

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:34.170
NARRATOR:
 Having found a stone marker

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:37.715
that appears to correspond with
one of the places indicated

01:09:37.715 --> 01:09:39.800
on Travis's star map,

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.845
the team heads to
a second location

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.305
just south of
the Money Pit site.

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:48.725
MARTY: You're batting
 a thousand, so far.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:50.100
Ha.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.479
One-one interesting spot,
one big boulder.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.856
Yeah, right there.
This would be one of your spots.

01:09:54.856 --> 01:09:56.900
There's the stone triangle on
the right-hand side.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.944
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is
one of the spots.

01:09:59.944 --> 01:10:02.530
NARRATOR:
 In 1897,

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:05.283
while exploring on the island's
southern shore,

01:10:05.283 --> 01:10:07.536
treasure hunter,
Frederick Blair,

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:10.872
discovered a mysterious group
of round stones

01:10:10.872 --> 01:10:13.125
that formed a perfect triangle.

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:15.877
Even more astonishing,
was the fact

01:10:15.877 --> 01:10:17.755
that the apex of the triangle

01:10:17.755 --> 01:10:20.798
pointed directly towards
the Money Pit.

01:10:20.798 --> 01:10:25.136
Unfortunately, during a massive
excavation conducted

01:10:25.136 --> 01:10:28.640
by treasure hunter
Robert Dunfield in 1965,

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.269
the so-called "stone triangle"
was destroyed.

01:10:32.269 --> 01:10:36.439
And, although a replica has
been built in its place,

01:10:36.439 --> 01:10:39.068
the precise orientation
of the triangle,

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.945
as well as the location of
the original Money Pit shaft

01:10:41.945 --> 01:10:44.657
remains unknown.

01:10:53.247 --> 01:10:55.417
I'm not even gonna get
my metal detector,

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:56.877
-'cause I've hammered this area.
-TRAVIS: I'm sure it's been

01:10:56.877 --> 01:10:58.628
-detected to death, right?
-GARY: Oh, yeah.

01:11:00.838 --> 01:11:02.548
JACK:
This is one of your points,

01:11:02.548 --> 01:11:04.134
and there was
a stone feature here.

01:11:04.134 --> 01:11:05.761
-A very obvious one.
-That's, that's wild.

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:08.514
-Right? So two for two.
-Two for two.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:09.640
-You're on a roll, mate.
-(laughter)

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.724
(laughs)

01:11:10.724 --> 01:11:12.268
When you were building your map,

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.310
did you specifically use

01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:16.188
the stone triangle
as one of the points?

01:11:16.188 --> 01:11:18.856
-How did you orient it?
-MARTY: Well, you lined the...

01:11:18.856 --> 01:11:21.402
No. I-I just tried to make sure
that the leg of the bull

01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:24.029
-fit on the island.
-Oh.

01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:26.614
It just happened--
It is what it is.

01:11:26.614 --> 01:11:29.743
And in your defense, in terms of
what you're looking for here,

01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:31.412
this has all been
heavily bulldozed.

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:33.372
Yeah, you can't deny

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:35.207
that you're hitting on all
cylinders, so that's cool.

01:11:35.207 --> 01:11:36.875
On to the next.

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:40.837
JACK: And this is another point
 where there's some sort

01:11:40.837 --> 01:11:45.300
of large boulder or a stone
monument on Travis's map.

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:48.470
Maybe it is, actually,
finally getting connected

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:49.887
the way it was supposed to be.

01:11:49.887 --> 01:11:52.515
NARRATOR:
 Having already marked

01:11:52.515 --> 01:11:54.893
two potentially important
locations on the island,

01:11:54.893 --> 01:11:59.314
Travis Taylor now uses
his star map to lead Marty,

01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:03.860
Jack and Gary to Lot 13, where,
if his theory is correct,

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.613
they will find another
stone marker.

01:12:06.613 --> 01:12:10.576
Is that a dirt pile?

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:13.369
Is that not a giant stone,
right there?

01:12:22.087 --> 01:12:25.215
-TRAVIS: No, that's a rock.
-JACK: Oh, it is.

01:12:28.676 --> 01:12:30.304
Well, it would be nice
to clear this out

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:31.721
and look at it better,
wouldn't it?

01:12:31.721 --> 01:12:33.599
Yeah.

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:42.690
TRAVIS: This one
has a flat side back here.

01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:44.359
We are in the general area

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:46.904
of where this point's
supposed to be.

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:48.529
Well, it's amazing
that we've run

01:12:48.529 --> 01:12:50.908
into big boulders at each point.

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:52.201
Yeah.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.036
MARTY:
 Could those stones

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:55.537
that we saw be markers

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.413
that were put there by some
human beings

01:12:57.413 --> 01:13:00.542
a long, long time ago to
correspond with a star map?

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:02.668
The answer is,
of course they could.

01:13:02.668 --> 01:13:06.506
We need to get corroborative
information, first of all.

01:13:06.506 --> 01:13:08.050
And then we'll draw, you know,

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.717
what conclusions we can draw
from that.

01:13:09.717 --> 01:13:12.345
What else do you see for
feedback exchange?

01:13:12.345 --> 01:13:14.055
Uh, well, I would like to see

01:13:14.055 --> 01:13:16.182
GPS coordinates to the rocks
we've been to.

01:13:16.182 --> 01:13:17.850
-Yep.
-Uh, then that would--

01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:19.936
might help me anchor
the map better.

01:13:19.936 --> 01:13:21.188
-You could move it around. Yeah.
-JACK: Yep.

01:13:21.188 --> 01:13:22.898
-Anyway, thank you very much.
-Yeah.

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:24.315
-Okay, thanks for having me.
-It's been a great day.

01:13:24.315 --> 01:13:25.818
-It's been fun.
-Been a great day.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:27.444
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Yeah, good to meet you.

01:13:27.444 --> 01:13:29.029
We'll look forward to this
feedback exchange

01:13:29.029 --> 01:13:30.530
-and, uh, see what we can find.
-All right, great.

01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:32.115
Hopefully we'll find something.

01:13:38.454 --> 01:13:40.582
NARRATOR:
 Before another long day

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:42.960
on Oak Island comes to an end,

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.003
Rick Lagina
and Dave Blankenship meet

01:13:46.003 --> 01:13:48.381
with representatives
from Irving Equipment, Limited,

01:13:48.381 --> 01:13:50.591
who have come to inspect
the structure.

01:13:50.591 --> 01:13:54.555
At stake is whether or not
the team's ambitious plan

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:56.890
to excavate the cove
can continue.

01:13:56.890 --> 01:13:58.600
MIKE J.: Looks like you got it
quite dry there now.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.935
RICK:
Yeah, it doesn't look bad.

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:02.520
We did do substantial caulking.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.398
-Okay.
-All the way around
the perimeter,

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:07.234
-or most of the way around.
-Yep. Yep.

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:09.444
We've reduced the water
infiltration by a lot,

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:12.989
but you can see some of the--
See those wet spots there?

01:14:12.989 --> 01:14:14.115
MIKE J.:
Yeah.

01:14:14.115 --> 01:14:15.993
RICK:
So, water is coming in.

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:19.328
There's no question about that,
and, uh, you know,

01:14:19.328 --> 01:14:22.082
-maybe we should walk the
perimeter and take a look-see.
-Sure.

01:14:22.082 --> 01:14:25.543
RICK: We initially had some
 concerns about the amount

01:14:25.543 --> 01:14:30.591
of water that was infiltrating
through the sheet pile locks.

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:33.217
And Mike and his team
had suggested

01:14:33.217 --> 01:14:36.262
a couple of different ways
to-to-to keep that water

01:14:36.262 --> 01:14:39.557
from infiltrating,
but at this point, you know,

01:14:39.557 --> 01:14:42.310
we're getting a bit more water
than we would like to see.

01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:44.688
And, uh,
the whole project relies

01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:47.024
on getting that ground
as dry as possible.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:49.359
So, we've called Irving,

01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:52.529
and Mike Jardine and Scott
are gonna come in today

01:14:52.529 --> 01:14:55.364
and, uh, visit the site and
take a look at the problems,

01:14:55.364 --> 01:14:58.034
and, hopefully,
make some suggestions

01:14:58.034 --> 01:15:01.537
that we can implement, and that
will mitigate that problem.

01:15:01.537 --> 01:15:04.582
-Hey, like here?
-Yeah.

01:15:04.582 --> 01:15:06.292
That's, that's definitely
a leak.

01:15:06.292 --> 01:15:08.170
-RICK: Mm-hmm.
-And I'm sure there was,

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.880
there was more of those
along here.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.797
RICK: Oh, yeah, there were.
I guar-- I guarantee you.

01:15:11.797 --> 01:15:14.176
And they were like a garden hose
on several of these

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.636
-just coming out.
-Yeah. No, that's...

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:17.595
and that's very common
to see that.

01:15:17.595 --> 01:15:20.015
From what I'm seeing
right here now,

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:24.019
you've got more water coming
this way than you have this way.

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:26.771
Because right here again,

01:15:26.771 --> 01:15:28.398
you've got a flow of water

01:15:28.398 --> 01:15:31.150
that's coming towards
your sheets.

01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:34.238
-It's not going away.
-Right.

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:36.823
Obviously, the water is coming
from back here somewhere.

01:15:36.823 --> 01:15:38.283
-Mm-hmm.
-Um, you know, uh,

01:15:38.283 --> 01:15:39.868
we all know that drops off
back there.

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.244
-Yep, yep.
-Um...

01:15:41.244 --> 01:15:44.622
You're gonna want to put
a small trench along there.

01:15:44.622 --> 01:15:47.751
If you were rigging-rigging here
with-with your trench...

01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:50.253
-Mm-hmm.
-...you know, come across.

01:15:50.253 --> 01:15:52.546
-And-and then go right across.
-Go in there.

01:15:52.546 --> 01:15:54.048
Stay out about six
or eight feet.

01:15:54.048 --> 01:15:56.217
-RICK: From sheet to sheet?
-I would. I would.

01:15:56.217 --> 01:15:58.970
NARRATOR: Because Mike Jardine
 believes the water

01:15:58.970 --> 01:16:01.640
is not only coming in through
the cofferdam,

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.685
but from other, natural sources
on the island,

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:08.188
the Oak Island team will need
to dig a trench

01:16:08.188 --> 01:16:10.731
on the inside perimeter
of the cove.

01:16:10.731 --> 01:16:13.402
This will allow water
to collect inside it,

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:17.072
before being pumped out
of the area.

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:19.615
I think we'll implement
your idea here,

01:16:19.615 --> 01:16:21.368
interdict this water
coming from the upland.

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:23.369
-Yep.
-And then we'll see

01:16:23.369 --> 01:16:24.997
how that affects
that water level.

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:27.291
MIKE J.: Yep. With that,
I think you're gonna see

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:29.001
a significant difference.

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:31.252
By controlling the water
back there,

01:16:31.252 --> 01:16:32.962
it's very manageable here now.

01:16:32.962 --> 01:16:35.340
RICK:
 Because of our efforts

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.050
to staunch the incoming water,

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:38.926
we've been more successful
than we,

01:16:38.926 --> 01:16:40.804
perhaps, had even anticipated.

01:16:40.804 --> 01:16:42.639
There's work to be done.

01:16:42.639 --> 01:16:44.265
We're gonna have to put pumps
on this,

01:16:44.265 --> 01:16:46.435
but we can't wait
to start digging.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:49.270
It-It's incredible to think
that this has been done.

01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:51.898
I'm ready to get in there
and start digging right now.

01:16:51.898 --> 01:16:53.317
MIKE J.:
 Oh, no, absolutely.

01:16:58.904 --> 01:17:01.533
♪ ♪

01:17:01.533 --> 01:17:04.828
MARTY: Rick, I have this
 really good feeling.

01:17:04.828 --> 01:17:07.581
NARRATOR: It is a moment
 of great anticipation

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:09.666
for brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina.

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:12.502
MARTY: I woke up this morning
thinking, okay,

01:17:12.502 --> 01:17:13.878
it's time to,
time to figure out this island.

01:17:13.878 --> 01:17:15.505
-So...
-RICK: Good.

01:17:15.505 --> 01:17:18.007
NARRATOR: Today, months
 of careful planning

01:17:18.007 --> 01:17:21.011
and tireless effort,

01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:23.846
as well as an investment
of over $1 million,

01:17:23.846 --> 01:17:27.516
are finally about to pay off,

01:17:27.516 --> 01:17:29.353
as the team prepares
to break ground

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:32.396
on their massive operation
at Smith's Cove.

01:17:32.396 --> 01:17:35.399
Smith's Cove, I think,
will go a long way

01:17:35.399 --> 01:17:37.903
towards answering two
of the Ws, right?

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:39.863
Who? Possibly.

01:17:39.863 --> 01:17:41.238
-And when. Yes.
-And when.

01:17:41.238 --> 01:17:43.492
MARTY:
 Whoa! Look at that.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.577
NARRATOR: After successfully
 sealing the leaks

01:17:45.577 --> 01:17:47.703
in the cofferdam wall,

01:17:47.703 --> 01:17:50.247
and digging trenches to collect
and drain out the water...

01:17:50.247 --> 01:17:51.957
That is quite a structure.

01:17:51.957 --> 01:17:55.087
NARRATOR: ...the nearly
 12,000 square foot area

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:58.422
is now dry enough for Rick,
Marty and their team

01:17:58.422 --> 01:18:00.716
to being excavating.

01:18:00.716 --> 01:18:03.136
-Why isn't this thing running?
-Well, you tell us.

01:18:03.136 --> 01:18:04.554
Let's get goin'.

01:18:04.554 --> 01:18:06.222
Push the buttons,
start moving dirt,

01:18:06.222 --> 01:18:07.890
finding coins, come on.

01:18:07.890 --> 01:18:10.726
MARTY:
 As the dig in Smith's Cove

01:18:10.726 --> 01:18:14.730
is about to commence with that
huge structure in place,

01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:17.109
I am realistically optimistic.

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:19.403
RICK:
 It's unlike any other project

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:20.779
we've endeavored to do
on the island,

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:22.238
but I very much look forward
to it.

01:18:22.238 --> 01:18:24.282
Once we find the east log,

01:18:24.282 --> 01:18:26.158
or the north or south log,

01:18:26.158 --> 01:18:29.078
we'll be properly oriented,
and the dig can proceed.

01:18:29.078 --> 01:18:30.997
MARTY: I was thinking,
we could start digging

01:18:30.997 --> 01:18:32.707
right where that water is

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.333
because Rick wants
to go parallel

01:18:34.333 --> 01:18:37.128
-to that U-shaped structure.
-Yep.

01:18:37.128 --> 01:18:40.756
NARRATOR: Guided by photos
 and surveys taken

01:18:40.756 --> 01:18:43.092
during Dan Blankenship's
excavation

01:18:43.092 --> 01:18:45.761
of Smith's Cove
in the early 1970s,

01:18:45.761 --> 01:18:48.597
the team's beginning their dig

01:18:48.597 --> 01:18:50.766
on the northwest side
of the beach.

01:18:50.766 --> 01:18:54.311
It is here they hope to uncover
what Dan dubbed

01:18:54.311 --> 01:18:56.939
a "mysterious U-shaped
structure"

01:18:56.939 --> 01:19:01.610
that reportedly lies buried at
a depth of some ten feet.

01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:03.572
RICK:
Hopefully, we can find

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.948
the south arm of the
U-shaped structure.

01:19:05.948 --> 01:19:07.908
I mean, I'd love to find a piece
with a Roman numeral on it.

01:19:07.908 --> 01:19:09.786
-That would be cool.
-Oh, yeah.

01:19:09.786 --> 01:19:11.454
I mean, as soon as that's
exposed, I want to get in there

01:19:11.454 --> 01:19:13.122
-and take a look at it.
-Craig?

01:19:13.122 --> 01:19:14.457
And get down to
the very bottom of it

01:19:14.457 --> 01:19:17.168
to see what else is down there.

01:19:17.168 --> 01:19:18.920
-There may be broken tools
and stuff like that...
-Exactly.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.465
...which, which can date
what time this is.

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:25.051
RICK: The pictures
where Dan excavated,

01:19:25.051 --> 01:19:27.804
those soils at ten, 11 feet down
could be at surface.

01:19:27.804 --> 01:19:29.430
CRAIG:
Oh, on some of it.

01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:31.015
Yeah, where he dug
and dumped it over. Yeah.

01:19:31.015 --> 01:19:35.103
So, we have to pay attention
from day one up here.

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:38.689
NARRATOR: As the team dredges up
 tons of earth and material

01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:41.318
in search of the
U-shaped structure,

01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:43.487
they will also carefully sort
through piles

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:47.823
of spoils by means of their
newly installed wash plant.

01:19:47.823 --> 01:19:51.036
The plant will automatically
clean and sort

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:54.663
the spoils according to size,
in hopes of uncovering

01:19:54.663 --> 01:19:56.875
historically important
artifacts,

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:58.710
or possible treasure,

01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:01.712
such as the medieval cross
that was discovered

01:20:01.712 --> 01:20:05.509
by Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton
just last year.

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:07.511
I can't speak to whether or not

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:10.514
there's actual "treasure"
discovery in Smith's Cove,

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:14.016
but there's certainly
gonna be lots of clues.

01:20:14.016 --> 01:20:19.396
We now are accumulating a very
big box of puzzle pieces,

01:20:19.396 --> 01:20:21.358
and it's about time

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:24.152
we start putting
the puzzle pieces together.

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:26.613
CRAIG:
Find anything?

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:28.739
Just found that.
Just that odd thing.

01:20:28.739 --> 01:20:30.867
I don't know what it is.

01:20:30.867 --> 01:20:32.868
-Could that be like a hinge?
-Yeah. Of some sort.

01:20:32.868 --> 01:20:34.371
Yep.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:36.622
CHARLES:
 Exciting.

01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:41.711
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty
 and the Oak Island team...

01:20:41.711 --> 01:20:43.880
Holy schmoly, all right!

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.548
-RICK: That's a cross.
-GARY: That's a cross.

01:20:45.548 --> 01:20:47.551
NARRATOR: ...what began
 with the discovery

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:49.426
of a small lead cross...

01:20:49.426 --> 01:20:52.596
has led to their most ambitious

01:20:52.596 --> 01:20:55.559
and most expensive
engineering project

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:58.310
ever conducted at Smith's Cove.

01:21:00.604 --> 01:21:03.608
But as their excavation efforts
finally get underway,

01:21:03.608 --> 01:21:05.609
what will they find?

01:21:05.609 --> 01:21:10.282
More incredible
religious artifacts?

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:13.243
The U-shaped structure
discovered

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:17.497
by Dan Blankenship
nearly half a century ago?

01:21:17.497 --> 01:21:21.626
The stone box drains that have
thwarted searcher efforts

01:21:21.626 --> 01:21:24.296
to dig in the nearby Money Pit?

01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:28.841
Or will they find
something else?

01:21:28.841 --> 01:21:31.970
Something so incredible

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:34.430
it will help them solve

01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:38.100
a 223-year-old treasure
mystery...

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.313
once and for all?
