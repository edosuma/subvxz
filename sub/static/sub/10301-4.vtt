01:17.880 --> 01:19.711
What time is it?

01:20.560 --> 01:24.109
- Three-thirty.
- A.m. or b. m.?

01:27.680 --> 01:29.352
B.m.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.355
You know, I don't know why
they call it b. m.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.950
I mean, why don't they call it p. m.
for " postmeridian"?

01:38.560 --> 01:40.835
God, sometimes I feel
like I am the last bastion...

01:41.040 --> 01:44.794
...of good sense on this forsaken
outpost of humanity.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.594
By the way, are my shoes
on the right feet?

01:48.360 --> 01:51.796
- No.
- Oh, so that's why they hurt.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.600
- Where's Mom?
- She's out with Seven.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.758
He sneezed, Mom panicked
and she took him to the doctor.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.635
Doctor? She never took us
to the doctor.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.637
I had a 109-degree temperature
and all she did was bleach my hair.

02:07.880 --> 02:11.919
It's because her Mom always told her,
" Bleach a cold, raise a beaver. "

02:15.320 --> 02:18.949
Gee, I thought it was,
" Feed a pimple, raise a troll. "

02:22.400 --> 02:24.914
My little sweetness.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.350
Look, honey, it's Al's children.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.960
Hi, Mom. Everything go all right?

02:37.160 --> 02:38.798
Oh, God, what an ordeal.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.195
I took Seven to a dozen specialists.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.198
They all agreed he just sneezed.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.834
You can't put a price
on that kind of news.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.874
Of course, those doctors sure did,
but I guess I just overreacted.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.957
I won't make that mistake again.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.916
Get out of my house.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.840
Get out of here
before you infect this child.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.600
Mom, it was just a feather
on the end of my nose.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.394
Well, that's what they said
when the Black Plague started.

03:06.600 --> 03:11.196
Now, I'll have none of that here.
Just wait outside till it passes.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.157
Gee, Bud,
sometimes life's a girl, huh?

03:22.560 --> 03:24.596
And I want you out too.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.439
- Why me?
- You were talking to Bud.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.074
You might have been infected.

03:30.800 --> 03:34.349
Mom. It's freezing out there.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.755
Gee, then I better shut the door.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.950
Oh, hi, Buck. We're home.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.832
Now you can play with Seven.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.759
<i>Oh, my God, I'd better sneeze.</i>

04:00.120 --> 04:03.430
I can just feel the mommy in me.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.356
- You'll talk to Mom about letting us in?
- Yeah, sure.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.672
Hi, Daddy. I had a question,
but Mommy said to ask you.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.598
Where do babies come from?

04:24.480 --> 04:29.235
Well, generally speaking,
a six-pack and two horny teenagers.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.233
He's only kidding.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.477
He really has no idea.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.998
Now, go play with Daddy's pennies,
but don't lose any.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.431
- They're for our retirement.
- Okay.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.078
Daddy, what's retirement?

04:48.280 --> 04:52.159
It's what men do when they die
and women do when they marry.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.634
Oh, honey, feeling a little glum?

04:58.840 --> 05:00.193
Well, this will cheer you up.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.995
You know you're always saying that
if I want money I should get it myself?

05:04.200 --> 05:07.715
Well, today I needed money
to pay Seven's doctor bills.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.388
Get ready to be proud of me.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.355
All by myself, I took cash
that was sitting doing nothing...

05:14.560 --> 05:16.949
...out of that pretty red envelope.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.674
You mean, the one in the mailbox...

05:19.880 --> 05:23.589
...that was addressed to
our mortgage company, Eviction Trust?

05:25.320 --> 05:26.799
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.117
When I open envelopes not addressed
to me, I just take the money.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.799
But I never read them.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.673
I feel that would be an invasion
of privacy.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.552
And yet you have no problem
living in my bedroom.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.199
Peg, don't you see,
the envelope was a pretty red one...

05:42.400 --> 05:46.757
...because the bank is a little mad at us
because we haven't paid in months.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.793
But on the good side, we'll be moving
to a roomier space now.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.434
It goes by the name "outside. "

05:54.160 --> 05:56.390
Are we ever gonna be let back
in the house?

05:56.680 --> 05:58.398
No, kids. None of us are.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.831
For, you see, Mommy spent
all of our mortgage money.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.390
Well, Al, you'll just have
to do something.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.239
All right. I will.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.835
I want my mommy!

06:16.080 --> 06:18.992
I don't want no excuses.
I want that 5 bucks you owe me.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.033
I don't care.
I'll see you in prison, Mom.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.435
Deadbeat.

06:24.680 --> 06:28.798
Gotta get a second job.
I gotta get something to pay for all this.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.236
All right, here we go.

06:33.520 --> 06:38.833
Hey, Al. Came over to borrow some ice,
but I'll just chip it off your kids.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.638
The want ads.
Husband's second worst fear.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.115
The first of course is hearing,
"Oh, God!

06:47.320 --> 06:50.471
What am I supposed to do with that?
It scares me. "

06:51.760 --> 06:55.116
But you get over that fear
after a thousand women have said it.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.356
- Jefferson, let me ask you something.
- What?

06:57.560 --> 06:59.790
How does Marcie let you get away
with not working?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.560
Well, Al, I'll tell you.
Whenever the subject comes up...

07:02.760 --> 07:08.676
...I just give her a ride
on the old Jefferson Airplane.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.112
Yep. Yep.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.750
- Help us.
- I can't. I'm a Republican.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.678
Well, hey, here's my little
frequent flier now.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.717
Jefferson, where have you been?

07:29.920 --> 07:32.275
You know what a difficult day
I was going to have...

07:32.480 --> 07:35.472
...and all I asked was for you
to fix me a bath and some supper...

07:35.680 --> 07:38.433
...and serve it to me
in your bicycle shorts.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.232
- But you did absolutely nothing.
- Nothing?

07:42.440 --> 07:45.193
Do you think that my skin
is naturally this smooth?

07:45.400 --> 07:47.675
It takes work, baby.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.552
Hey, that is pretty smooth.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.830
Hey, you wanna tell Peg
what you're using here?

07:57.040 --> 07:59.474
Oh, this is intoxicating.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.670
- Thanks, Al.
- Well, thank you.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.029
Oh, please. Now, listen, missy.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.990
I am through
paying for your fanny buffs.

08:15.160 --> 08:18.152
Do you mind getting your hands
off my husband.

08:20.720 --> 08:25.236
And you. It's time you got your little
apple butt in gear and got a job.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.189
Well, why don't we talk about this
at home, Marcie.

08:28.400 --> 08:32.154
Hearken. I think I hear your flight
boarding right now.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.510
We'll have you strapped in
in a minute, baby.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.595
Oh, well, all right.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.635
But we are gonna talk
about this job thing.

08:42.840 --> 08:46.037
Oh, yeah. Feel this, Marcie.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.830
Oh, my goodness.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.511
What was I saying?

08:53.080 --> 08:54.798
Well, it couldn't
have been important.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.151
Listen, I'm gonna go home
and get ready for takeoff.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.515
Get a wax, baby.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.870
You never look back.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.230
All right, let's see here.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.875
" No education, no experience
and no drive necessary. "

09:19.120 --> 09:21.839
Now, what kind of stupid job
could that-

09:22.040 --> 09:24.190
Oh, yeah, a shoe salesman.

09:25.720 --> 09:30.350
<i>Hey, here's one:
" Bartender in a topless bar. "</i>

09:30.560 --> 09:33.632
Well, I think I could handle that.

09:34.120 --> 09:38.750
All it takes is a little maturity,
and as we know, I am a mature man.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.395
I'm gonna see boobies.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.551
Hi. You the boss?

09:57.040 --> 09:58.268
Yeah.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.119
What can I do for you, sweet cheeks?

10:05.840 --> 10:09.435
Well, for one thing, you can look
at my face when you're talking to me.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.950
And for another,
I'm here for the bartending job.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.199
You'll do.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.833
You'll do just fine.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.750
Hot doggy!

10:21.520 --> 10:23.351
When do all the topless babes
get here?

10:25.040 --> 10:27.759
Oh, my God, it's not you, is it?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.350
No, it's not me.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.312
It's you.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.679
Hey, bartender, let's hurry up
with those drinks!

11:00.320 --> 11:03.198
He's shy.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.233
Let's see it, baby. Honk, honk.

11:08.920 --> 11:12.913
Well, if you've got it, trot it.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.588
What's your temperature?

12:04.800 --> 12:06.472
This long.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.831
Kel, that's not how you do it.
It's not how long it is.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.198
Yeah, right.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.355
Or how smart it is.

12:20.920 --> 12:23.434
Let's see what the thermometer says.

12:29.960 --> 12:33.032
Kelly, this is a meat thermometer.

12:35.240 --> 12:38.550
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I'm not a fish.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.592
You don't look so good.
You're not gonna pass out, are you?

12:42.800 --> 12:44.472
No.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.034
Mom, I think Kelly passed out
from her fever.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.514
Oh, my.

12:51.720 --> 12:55.508
Well, after I feed Seven,
I'll bleach her hair.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.832
How does it feel, Peg?

13:27.040 --> 13:31.397
To get for free what every other woman
in Chicago has to pay for.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.348
Go ahead, touch it, Peg.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.470
Touch the tush
that set Chicago afire.

13:40.160 --> 13:43.277
Well, if you don't mind.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.832
And now on to you, honey.

13:49.040 --> 13:54.239
Tell me, is that money
in your pants or are you...?

13:54.440 --> 13:55.839
Well, let's face it.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.759
It could only be money.

13:59.800 --> 14:05.193
Yep. There's another kind of green
in my underwear now, Peg.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.110
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my God, Al.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.197
After all these years
of experimenting...

14:15.400 --> 14:18.915
...you've finally found something to do
with your pelvic area.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.679
Wait, Peg, there's more.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.038
Oh, Al, you've been
saying that for years.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.879
I think it's time we just dropped
the senseless charade.

14:27.080 --> 14:31.039
- But it's fine, honey. Really it is.
- It's better than fine, Peg.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.356
It gives change.

14:38.120 --> 14:41.874
Peg. Yeah, I feel good. Yeah, I do.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.278
I quit my shoe job, Peg.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.072
No time for it, really.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.679
Don't regret the shoe business.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.997
<i>'Twas a pleasant little interlude
until I found my true calling:</i>

14:51.200 --> 14:53.760
Shakin' Al Junior and the...

14:53.960 --> 14:55.552
...Pips.

15:00.480 --> 15:05.190
You know, Al, I'm not sure,
but I think I might have just had one.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.079
Hey.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.633
Mary.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.398
Doris.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.828
Beth.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.396
Al, these are other women's
phone numbers.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.999
I don't know if I like this.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.989
Do I see the redheaded
monster of jealousy?

15:27.800 --> 15:29.153
Well, I don't know.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.634
Should I be jealous?

15:30.840 --> 15:31.909
Well...

15:32.120 --> 15:33.838
...yes.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.675
I mean, look what
they're all seeing, Peg.

15:36.880 --> 15:41.351
The same thing God saw when he said,
" Let there be man. "

15:41.560 --> 15:45.473
But, Peg, as ugly as these women are,
I still come home to you.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.229
I don't know, honey.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.750
I love this money,
and I know those women are ugly...

15:50.960 --> 15:53.599
...but, you know, the truth is,
I'm not a very good wife.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.597
I don't do anything for you.

15:55.800 --> 15:59.634
I mean, what if these other women
finally started paying attention to you?

15:59.840 --> 16:02.991
It's a long shot,
but I can't take that chance.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.474
I want you to quit.

16:04.680 --> 16:08.514
Oh, Peg.
It's hard to tell these to quit.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.073
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.317
<i>I just had a Village People flashback.</i>

16:23.320 --> 16:25.390
People pay to see me like this.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.830
Oh, okay, so will I.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.678
Here's a dollar.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.916
Sing "YMCA."

16:33.520 --> 16:35.954
No, wait, here's $2.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.470
Put a shirt on.
I can't stand to see you topless.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.399
Well, at least people know
when I'm topless.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.878
My back has bigger breasts than you.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.558
No, your front
has bigger breasts than me.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.435
You leave my Alsy alone.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.757
He has to dress like this
for his second job.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.996
Second job?

17:07.119 --> 17:11.159
Jefferson, don't you think it's time
you got a first job?

17:11.359 --> 17:13.828
Okay, Marcie, come on.
Let's go do the "Oh, Jefferson. "

17:14.040 --> 17:16.998
Fine. Oh, Jefferson, get a job.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.473
You may be cuter than I am...

17:18.680 --> 17:21.637
...but it's time you started pulling
your own weight around here.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.115
I mean, if I wanted peanuts,
I'd fly Delta.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.278
Look, Al, you gotta help me.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.913
Well, all right, all right.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.475
When you're with Marcie,
shut your eyes real tight...

17:34.680 --> 17:37.069
...and picture one of the Golden Girls.

17:37.680 --> 17:40.148
That ought to be a step up from reality.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.592
Thanks, Al. I'll do that.
But I'm talking about this work thing.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.836
I mean, I'd die. I'd just die...

17:46.040 --> 17:48.998
...if I had to give up my prime 2 p. m.
manicure appointment.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.872
If I miss even one...

17:51.080 --> 17:53.799
...I just know some damn woman's
gonna scarf it up.

17:55.360 --> 17:58.318
<i>So you're the bitch with 2:00.</i>

18:01.520 --> 18:03.795
You know, I've been wondering
who that blond was...

18:04.000 --> 18:06.355
...Eduardo is so in love with.

18:09.320 --> 18:13.233
Dad, now that you've discussed Mom
and our stupid neighbour's problems...

18:13.440 --> 18:16.477
...think you could pull a dollar out
so we could have some aspirin?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.077
Son, are you here?

18:21.320 --> 18:22.992
Jefferson...

18:25.000 --> 18:29.118
...I might be able to find you
something and at night.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.596
- Yeah?
- Peg. You gotta feel this.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.353
Well, of course it's soft, Al.
He's Eduardo's pet.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.438
Well, I'm just trying to tell you
that it's enchanting.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.837
Gee, Al, you sure know how
to make a man feel good.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.033
Well, it's easy when I'm around you.

18:48.600 --> 18:52.479
- Hey, the Bears are playing tonight.
- Yeah, that football. What a game, huh?

18:56.840 --> 18:57.955
- Anyway.
- Yeah?

18:58.160 --> 18:59.639
You stick with me tonight...

18:59.840 --> 19:04.072
...and you'll see the Dalai Lama of guy
do his thing.

19:34.400 --> 19:38.473
Oh, hey. Remember, ladies,
I do weddings and bar mitzvahs.

19:45.240 --> 19:48.755
- Yes, ma'am.
- Could you give this to the cute one?

19:49.520 --> 19:51.750
Why, if you were a woman, I'd...

20:11.720 --> 20:15.429
Did you get any more phone numbers,
Mr. Casanova Bundy?

20:16.200 --> 20:19.317
Well, Peg, I was thinking about
what you were saying...

20:19.520 --> 20:23.195
...you know about being
jealous and all and...

20:23.400 --> 20:25.630
So for you...

20:25.840 --> 20:28.400
...I gave up my topless career.

20:29.320 --> 20:33.279
And wrote "go home" on my chest.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.311
You got fired, huh?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.228
Yes, I did.

20:40.040 --> 20:45.956
Jefferson took all my women,
and now there's nothing in my pants.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.796
You have no money,
and you want me to console you?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.798
God, what a woman you are.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.194
Well, Al, I have some good news
and some bad news.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.913
It's not a good time now, Peg.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.348
I understand.

21:02.560 --> 21:06.155
Anyhow, Seven coughed,
so I took him to several doctors.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.475
Specialists, actually.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.477
The good news is he's fine.

21:09.680 --> 21:13.309
But the bad news is
those specialists were very expensive.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.034
But don't worry, honey,
I took care of it myself.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.071
I just took money
out of that envelope...

21:18.280 --> 21:21.431
...that you were gonna use
for your car insurance.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.110
Damn Dodge.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.592
Gee, honey,
that might have been your Dodge.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.554
Well, maybe I can get
my old job back.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.070
Unbelievably enough,
the position has not been filled.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.793
Oh, my God,
I'm a shoe salesman again.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.712
Oh, Al.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.514
Well, honey,
if it's any comfort at all...

21:51.720 --> 21:56.236
...no matter how bad it gets,
at least you won't be alone.
