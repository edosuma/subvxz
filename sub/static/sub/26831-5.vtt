that morning-- the subject?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.585
-MAN: Mmm.
-WOMAN: That was his mistake?

18:47.627 --> 18:49.254
MAN: No. I mean,

18:49.295 --> 18:51.089
I don't know. Mistake?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.091
He was just
picking up pain medicine.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.510
That's okay. He's a kid.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.721
He's not John Wayne.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.849
I thought he might do it,
and he did it.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.101
And that's where we
picked him up.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.144
Yeah.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.065
(Carol sniffles)

19:09.107 --> 19:11.276
EDWARD:
Oh, hey.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.279
It's okay. I'm sure
lots of veterinarians

19:14.320 --> 19:15.905
would have failed
at the finger thing.

19:15.947 --> 19:19.868
CAROL:
I don't care about that.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.370
You almost got killed.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.875
Edward...

19:26.916 --> 19:29.752
I don't want you to do
what you've been doing.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.672
EDWARD:
Being a congressman?

19:32.714 --> 19:34.382
CAROL:
No, that's okay. I mean...

19:34.424 --> 19:36.968
it's kind of gross,

19:37.010 --> 19:40.388
but I'm not afraid of it.

19:40.430 --> 19:44.100
I mean... helping your dad.

19:44.142 --> 19:47.145
EDWARD: I'm not helping my Dad,
I'm helping John.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.570
You're hot when you operate.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.406
CAROL:
Thanks.

19:58.448 --> 20:02.076
EDWARD: You think it's hot
that I got shot?

20:02.118 --> 20:03.286
-Little bit?
-CAROL: No.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.747
EDWARD:
Little bit?

20:05.788 --> 20:08.958
CAROL:
Little bit, maybe.

20:21.095 --> 20:23.640
Cantar Walley
leaves in three days.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.522
All's calm enough
for now, so, uh,

20:31.564 --> 20:34.525
let's take a couple days off.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.277
Rest up for it.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.489
Yeah?

20:47.246 --> 20:50.583
Hello.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.126
TOM:
Hello?

20:52.168 --> 20:53.711
Gregory Gordon, HR.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.255
Tom...

20:56.297 --> 20:59.509
Yeah, we met at the duck hunt.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.928
What are you doing in our...

21:01.970 --> 21:03.346
Leslie summoned me.

21:03.388 --> 21:05.515
Here. From Luxembourg.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.392
To help shore up
our Denon presentation.

21:07.433 --> 21:11.020
Which is listing, and...

21:12.271 --> 21:13.940
And...?

21:13.982 --> 21:17.110
He mentioned John
could use some shoring up.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.320
Also.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.364
Leslie mentioned that.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.257
Hey, there.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.300
(chuckles)

21:43.845 --> 21:46.139
Hello, son.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.019
Leslie Claret.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.228
(chuckles)

21:52.270 --> 21:55.106
I'm very pleased to meet you.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.525
Hi, I'm Valerie.

22:00.611 --> 22:01.988
Well.

22:02.030 --> 22:04.574
Who do we have here, huh?

22:04.615 --> 22:05.783
Hey, buddy.

22:05.825 --> 22:09.537
I'm your grandpa.

22:09.579 --> 22:12.040
What do think of that?

22:14.167 --> 22:16.085
(quietly):
Oh, my God.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.336
MARCUS:
Fuck.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.177
Ah.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.601
(clears throat)

22:31.642 --> 22:33.603
Oh. Okay.

22:33.644 --> 22:37.398
Well, I guess we enjoyed
this one previously.

22:40.818 --> 22:44.739
So, when were you guys blessed

22:44.781 --> 22:48.242
with this beautiful little girl?

22:49.368 --> 22:51.621
He's a boy.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.167
Oh. Yeah.

22:58.044 --> 23:01.172
Well, it's the hair.

23:01.214 --> 23:03.382
Sorry.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.930
Probably needs a haircut, huh?

23:08.971 --> 23:10.681
We'll decide that. Thanks.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.767
Oh, of course, of course.

23:12.809 --> 23:16.521
I'm just pointing out
that the boy needs a haircut

23:16.562 --> 23:19.315
'cause he looks like a girl.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.067
-Don't say that.
-What?

23:21.109 --> 23:22.401
You know what?

23:22.443 --> 23:24.445
This was a bad idea.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.030
Can I talk to you?

23:26.072 --> 23:28.616
-It's getting late, Dad.
-What's wrong, son?

23:28.658 --> 23:31.661
Hey, let's just talk
in the kitchen for a second.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.635
I'm gonna give you a haircut.

23:47.677 --> 23:50.513
With this steak knife.

23:50.555 --> 23:53.432
Is that cool?

23:53.474 --> 23:56.644
Hey, he's probably nervous.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.354
He probably had
a glass of wine before.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.189
He probably had coke.

24:00.231 --> 24:01.649
And ten glasses of wine.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.276
Come on.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.403
It's awkward for everybody.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.822
Please.

24:07.864 --> 24:10.449
It's called the Dutch Boy.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.326
It's a real classic.

24:12.368 --> 24:13.536
Oh, my God.

24:13.578 --> 24:15.037
What?

24:15.079 --> 24:17.373
Stop. You're cutting
his fucking hair?

24:17.415 --> 24:19.834
We're having a good time here.

24:19.876 --> 24:22.003
You're fucking wasted.

24:22.044 --> 24:23.921
It's late, Dad.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.131
It's time to go.

24:25.173 --> 24:26.257
I just got here.

24:26.299 --> 24:29.802
It's time to go.

24:29.844 --> 24:33.431
We were having
a-a nice moment, here.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.851
I used to cut your hair
on occasion, pal.

24:36.893 --> 24:40.062
It would give us
a chance to catch up, and...

24:40.104 --> 24:42.356

John, I'm con-I'm concerned.

26:26.961 --> 26:29.005
Okay.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.881
How much sleep
are you getting, John?

26:30.923 --> 26:32.925
None.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.221
Privation and strain

26:37.263 --> 26:38.973

by delayed restoration,

26:39.015 --> 26:42.893

uh, creates...

26:46.230 --> 26:49.400
unsustainable
psychological landscapes.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.402
We need certain things.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.821
Like sleep.

26:53.863 --> 26:56.407
And beyond that, in fact,
we discovered.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.784
This sounds odd--
I understand that--

26:58.826 --> 27:00.870
but it's a real thing.

27:00.911 --> 27:03.539
What is?

27:03.581 --> 27:05.666
Dream deprivation.

27:05.708 --> 27:09.795
Dream deprivation?

27:09.837 --> 27:12.089
We need sleep, in part,

27:12.131 --> 27:15.134
because we need to dream.
It seems.

27:15.176 --> 27:18.512
Uh, to gain release or some,

27:18.554 --> 27:22.683
uh, I guess, clemency

27:25.227 --> 27:28.314

27:28.356 --> 27:30.232
We need to dream, John,

27:30.274 --> 27:32.276
and if you deny yourself
your dreams

27:32.318 --> 27:34.612
for too long a period of time,

27:34.653 --> 27:37.615
and you keep moving forward
in this same state,

27:37.656 --> 27:41.494
uh, you can be compelled
to lose a sense of reality.

27:41.535 --> 27:44.663
To make a break, uh,

27:44.705 --> 27:48.167
from the encumbrance or...

27:48.209 --> 27:51.670
weight of reality.

-Yeah.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.509
Fuck yeah.

34:12.551 --> 34:17.055
-Hey. Eddie's getting married.
-No way.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.724
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.434
Cool move, Cool Rick.

34:22.019 --> 34:23.854
So can we talk bachelor party?

34:23.896 --> 34:25.773
-Yeah.
-We're getting married tomorrow,

34:25.814 --> 34:28.025
so that should be... today.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.402
I really want to see
Dennis fucked up.

34:30.444 --> 34:33.030
Yeah, and Icabod and Gordon.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.990
(chuckles)

34:35.032 --> 34:37.868
And we can bury
John Lakeman, too.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.579
Why?

34:40.621 --> 34:42.956
I can't be him anymore.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.459
Mom made me get my fingers
back on as him,

34:45.501 --> 34:49.379
and people are looking for him,
so he has to disappear now.

34:49.421 --> 34:52.758
He has to go away.

34:52.800 --> 34:56.011
I have the day off.

34:56.053 --> 34:58.263
I heard.

34:58.305 --> 35:01.892
So can we get the party
started now?

35:01.934 --> 35:06.313
-It's, like, 11:00 a.m.
-Yeah, I know.

35:06.355 --> 35:10.234
(chuckles) Let's do it.

35:10.275 --> 35:13.237
-Are you gonna drink?
-Probably.

35:13.278 --> 35:16.532
It's a bachelor party,
and I have the day off.

35:16.573 --> 35:21.036
Well, you're on painkillers.
Just be careful.

35:21.078 --> 35:24.790
-You're coming with us.
-I am?

35:24.832 --> 35:28.418
Yeah.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.921
So, I guess Carol's coming
with us now, too?

35:30.963 --> 35:32.965
'Cause...

35:33.006 --> 35:34.341
Guess so.
