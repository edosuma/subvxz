00:55.634 --> 00:57.509
Hey, Jake. What's wrong?

00:57.567 --> 00:59.771
You look dumpy. How come?

00:59.833 --> 01:03.605
I-Is it because of
that metal box?

01:03.665 --> 01:05.266
Is something sad inside?

01:05.331 --> 01:07.240
No. It's nothing.

01:07.297 --> 01:09.467
There's lots of boxes that
have nothing in them.

01:09.530 --> 01:11.632
But also, you could put
something in the box.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.264
And then it won't be empty!

01:13.329 --> 01:14.931
Does that make you feel better?

01:16.428 --> 01:18.132
You're a charmer, Finn human.

01:18.192 --> 01:20.329
No. It's... well...

01:20.392 --> 01:22.267
Lady Rainicorn
doesn't want to play

01:22.325 --> 01:24.427
the game Card Wars with me.

01:26.324 --> 01:27.767
I always beat her.

01:27.823 --> 01:30.266
So she says, "no
more card warring."

01:30.322 --> 01:31.766
What's Card Wars?

01:31.821 --> 01:33.094
It's a fantasy card game

01:33.155 --> 01:35.358
that's super-complicated
and awesome,

01:35.420 --> 01:37.523
but, well... oh,
it's kinda stupid.

01:37.586 --> 01:39.187
Never mind.

01:39.252 --> 01:40.892
How come you never
talked about it before?

01:40.917 --> 01:42.690
It sounds cool. - Really?!

01:42.750 --> 01:44.852
Well, I thought you'd
say it was for nerds

01:44.916 --> 01:46.450
who do not know how life is

01:46.516 --> 01:48.357
outside of the nerd universe.

01:48.416 --> 01:49.654
I-it is, man.

01:49.715 --> 01:51.817
But I still totally
want to play it.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.222
So no more moping, okay?

01:53.279 --> 01:55.086
Thanks, Finn.

02:03.443 --> 02:05.750
Oh, hey, Beemo. You
want to play, too'?

02:05.809 --> 02:09.683
No! I do not play such games...
with Jake!

02:09.740 --> 02:11.774
- What's that mean?
- Ah, whatever.

02:11.839 --> 02:14.748
Let's play the game!

02:14.805 --> 02:16.976
So, what kind of
stakes do we play for?

02:17.039 --> 02:18.912
How about the loser...

02:18.970 --> 02:20.572
is a dweeb,

02:20.636 --> 02:22.204
and the winner is a cool guy?

02:22.269 --> 02:23.871
Those are good stakes.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.501
Coffee grounds, beetle butter,

02:31.565 --> 02:34.167
grape jelly, kimchi,

02:34.231 --> 02:37.333
aaand this stuff.

02:37.397 --> 02:40.067
Hey! You're ruining that
pop with weird taste!

02:43.461 --> 02:45.836
We drink when the game is over.

02:45.894 --> 02:47.132
Oh, gross.

02:47.193 --> 02:49.534
Now, let me explain the rules.

02:50.525 --> 02:52.196
That's basically the basics.

02:52.258 --> 02:54.326
So once we have our
kingdom setup...

02:55.490 --> 02:56.933
it's time to start to play...

02:56.989 --> 02:58.864
for the gloryyyy!

02:58.923 --> 03:00.457
Huh?

03:00.522 --> 03:01.863
Hey, were you asleep?

03:01.922 --> 03:04.228
I'll have to explain
it all over again!

03:04.287 --> 03:05.992
Doesn't matter. Let's just play.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.826
But if you don't know the rules,

03:07.886 --> 03:09.846
then you're gonna lose in
the first couple rounds,

03:09.885 --> 03:11.487
like Lady always does.

03:11.551 --> 03:13.993
And then you'll hate the game.
And then you'll hate max'

03:14.050 --> 03:15.493
And then, and then...

03:15.549 --> 03:17.322
Pfft! You think
you're gonna win?

03:17.383 --> 03:20.622
I'm gonna crush you...
Party-dance style, dweeb!

03:20.681 --> 03:22.453
Bring it!

03:22.513 --> 03:24.457
So, how do I get my
land on the map'?

03:24.513 --> 03:26.115
Oh.

03:26.179 --> 03:28.553
You, uh, floop your land cards.

03:31.344 --> 03:32.844
Uh...

03:32.910 --> 03:34.410
Keep those honeys hidden,

03:34.476 --> 03:36.384
or I'll get a
strategic advantage!

03:36.441 --> 03:38.077
Oh! Hmm...

03:38.141 --> 03:39.914
Okay, I go first.

03:39.974 --> 03:42.814
I floop the Silo of Truth!

03:44.506 --> 03:46.278
Hey!

03:46.338 --> 03:48.281
Pfft! You got really lame cards.

03:48.337 --> 03:49.337
Hmm...

03:49.371 --> 03:52.314
I'll take the Cerebral
Blood Storm, though.

03:53.802 --> 03:55.074
Huh?

03:55.135 --> 03:57.078
Okay, now it's the battle phase.

03:57.134 --> 04:00.542
I'm attacking your schoolhouse
with my Husker Knights.

04:01.898 --> 04:05.898
And, I'm casting
Cerebral Blood Storm.

04:07.197 --> 04:10.606
So, what do you use to defend?

04:12.562 --> 04:14.971
Uh... can my Cool Dog

04:15.028 --> 04:16.971
and Ancient Scholar defeat
your Husker Knights?

04:18.726 --> 04:20.327
Of course not!

04:20.392 --> 04:23.164
Hmm. Then I floop the pig...

04:23.224 --> 04:24.758
What?!

04:24.824 --> 04:26.926
- What?
- Okay, okay.

04:26.990 --> 04:30.762
First of all, you don't floop
a creature to make it fight.

04:30.822 --> 04:32.424
You activate a creature.

04:32.488 --> 04:34.089
Hmm. No!

04:34.153 --> 04:37.153
It says I can floop the pig.
See?

04:41.517 --> 04:43.461
No!

04:43.517 --> 04:45.357
He's eating all my cornfields!

04:45.416 --> 04:48.620
My Husker Knights draw
energy from corn!

04:48.681 --> 04:50.681
And since I'm not
actually attacking,

04:50.748 --> 04:52.554
your Cerebral Blood
Storm only does damage

04:52.614 --> 04:54.682
to your own kingdom's troops.

04:57.012 --> 04:59.955
You just wiped out
my entire attack!

05:00.011 --> 05:02.851
What do you expect if all your
power units come from corn?

05:02.910 --> 05:05.853
Pigs eat corn, dude.
Cornfields stink.

05:05.909 --> 05:08.317
Cornfields are awesome!

05:08.374 --> 05:11.011
What makes you think you know
so much about Card Wars?!

05:11.074 --> 05:13.744
- It's just logic.
- Your turn.

05:13.806 --> 05:14.908
Hmm...

05:14.972 --> 05:16.643
You're supposed
to discard a card

05:16.705 --> 05:18.478
and pick up a new one first.

05:18.538 --> 05:19.640
Oh, right.

05:19.704 --> 05:21.941
Look at you. You're a
babe in the woods.

05:22.002 --> 05:24.071
Your beginner's luck
ends this round!

05:24.135 --> 05:26.203
Hmm.

05:29.533 --> 05:32.738
Spirit Tower! And the
Cave of Solitude?!

05:32.799 --> 05:34.901
Now my battle phase begins.

05:34.965 --> 05:38.907
I activate my ancient
scholar to begin studying.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.701
And I also move my pig
to the Cave of Solitude

05:41.761 --> 05:43.966
so he can take a nap.

05:44.028 --> 05:46.766
That's it? You're not attacking?

05:46.827 --> 05:48.463
I'll attack on a different turn.

05:48.527 --> 05:50.470
Ha! Then the seas have aligned

05:50.526 --> 05:52.469
and the five winds waft
the smell of victory

05:52.525 --> 05:54.331
to my palace doors!

05:54.390 --> 05:56.459
I cast "Field of Nightmares"

05:56.524 --> 05:58.432
and activate my
legion of ear-lings

05:58.489 --> 05:59.988
to scare your pig to death!

06:00.055 --> 06:01.090
♪ La, la, la, la ♪

06:01.156 --> 06:02.995
My pig's in the
Cave of Solitude.

06:03.054 --> 06:05.328
Um... I cast "Teleport"

06:05.387 --> 06:07.091
to move your pig
to the empty field

06:07.153 --> 06:08.653
so I can attack him!

06:08.719 --> 06:10.662
Uh... wouldn't
"Teleport" only work

06:10.718 --> 06:12.956
on your own creatures?
- You're right.

06:13.017 --> 06:14.756
I'm gonna slay that pig, though.

06:14.816 --> 06:17.487
How? You don't have any
creatures that can touch him.

06:17.549 --> 06:18.617
Ugh!

06:18.682 --> 06:21.557
Face it, man. I'm the cool guy.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.852
Hmm...

06:22.913 --> 06:25.480
You're the cool guy, huh?

06:25.545 --> 06:28.454
Well, let me make it a
little hot for you, then.

06:30.177 --> 06:32.155
I floop the volcano.

06:32.211 --> 06:33.153
What?!

06:33.210 --> 06:35.010
That'll destroy your
kingdom, too, won't it'?!

06:35.043 --> 06:36.986
Hmph! Maybe Oh!

06:37.042 --> 06:38.849
Aah!

06:38.908 --> 06:39.941
My Pig!

06:40.007 --> 06:41.075
♪ La, la ♪

06:41.140 --> 06:43.277
Aah!

06:45.572 --> 06:47.447
The pig is dead.

06:47.505 --> 06:49.311
Now I reconstitute my cornfields

06:49.370 --> 06:52.142
using the "Reclaim
Landscape" spell.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.703
My Husker Knights, revive!

06:54.968 --> 06:57.843
And I still have
my battle phase.

06:57.900 --> 07:02.365
Hiding in the useless swamp,
the Immortal Maize Walker!

07:02.432 --> 07:04.603
I love corn!

07:04.666 --> 07:06.608
Ah!

07:06.664 --> 07:09.869
Cornfields give the immortal
maize walker triple damage.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.236
Uh...

07:11.296 --> 07:13.671
I told you cornfields
are awesome!

07:13.728 --> 07:15.602
Your Ancient Scholar
and Cool Dog

07:15.661 --> 07:17.400
won't survive this time.

07:17.460 --> 07:19.403
Actually, my Ancient
Scholar's been studying

07:19.459 --> 07:21.130
the "Raise the Dead" ability.

07:21.193 --> 07:23.033
- So what?
- So...

07:23.091 --> 07:25.625
My Ancient Scholar
raises the dead.

07:27.024 --> 07:28.296
I floop the pig.

07:28.356 --> 07:32.059
No-o-o-o-o-o!

07:32.121 --> 07:34.996
Look. My toweﬂs doing a thing.

07:35.053 --> 07:38.394
Hominy-hominy-hominy!

07:38.453 --> 07:40.726
You ganked my Spirit Walker!

07:40.785 --> 07:42.262
Ah!

07:45.417 --> 07:48.053
Uh, maybe we should
take a break?

07:50.281 --> 07:51.724
Your turn.

07:51.780 --> 07:53.314
Huh?

07:53.380 --> 07:54.414
You Play!

07:54.480 --> 07:55.923
You Play!

07:56.913 --> 07:58.355
Oh, zang.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.320
I do not play such games...

08:00.378 --> 08:03.617
with Jake.

08:03.677 --> 08:07.517
Sorry! I gotta use
the boy style room.

08:07.575 --> 08:10.950
Beemo! Beemo!

08:11.008 --> 08:12.280
Beemo chop!

08:12.340 --> 08:14.942
If this were a real
attack, you'd be dead.

08:15.006 --> 08:17.505
Beemo! Jake's acting
boonoonoonoos!

08:17.571 --> 08:20.571
Oh, no! Are you winning
the game of Card Wars?

08:20.637 --> 08:22.580
- Yeah!
- That's terrible!

08:22.636 --> 08:25.579
If Jake loses that game,
he gets super depressed!

08:25.635 --> 08:29.272
When I beat him, he wouldn't
talk to me for a month!

08:29.334 --> 08:30.743
What?!

08:30.800 --> 08:32.743
I only played so he
wouldn't be bummed!

08:32.799 --> 08:35.537
Finn, you must take a dive.

08:35.597 --> 08:36.938
Okay, I'll try.

08:36.998 --> 08:39.270
But I'm a Card Wars
super Amadeus.

08:39.328 --> 08:41.897
Whoop!

08:41.962 --> 08:45.427
Play... the... game.

08:45.494 --> 08:47.438
Grob. Better make
this look good.

08:49.259 --> 08:52.532
All right, Jake. Prepare
for my ultimo-attack!

08:52.591 --> 08:56.159
Well, I've still got
my Wandering Bald Man.

08:56.223 --> 08:57.928
Oh, no.

08:57.990 --> 08:59.399
I need to get rid of my pig

08:59.456 --> 09:03.227
so Jake can reconstitute
his cornfields.

09:03.287 --> 09:05.026
I activate the pig

09:05.087 --> 09:07.927
to attack your
Wandering Bald Man.

09:07.986 --> 09:10.327
That's stupid.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.794
Just attack with
Immortal Maize Walker

09:11.818 --> 09:13.419
and get the game over with!

09:13.483 --> 09:14.722
No way!

09:14.784 --> 09:20.590
You've underestimated
me and my pig all day.

09:20.648 --> 09:23.523
Please lose. Please lose.

09:31.011 --> 09:33.078
No-o-o-o!

09:40.374 --> 09:43.816
Oh-ho! Oh! Oh, yeah!

09:43.873 --> 09:47.145
Pigs can't leave mud landscapes
once they're on them!

09:47.204 --> 09:50.079
Ha ha ha! The pig is mine!

09:50.137 --> 09:52.841
First, I'll play
Reclaim Landscape.

09:52.902 --> 09:55.573
Then I cast "Summon Archer Dan."

10:00.566 --> 10:03.271
Whoa, math...

10:07.964 --> 10:09.340
M'boys!

10:09.396 --> 10:11.236
You have no creatures left.

10:11.295 --> 10:13.569
That's the game, boy!

10:13.629 --> 10:17.230
The five winds blow through
cornfields once again

10:17.293 --> 10:19.736
for the glory of Jakoria!

10:19.793 --> 10:22.326
Heh. You got me.

10:22.392 --> 10:24.336
In your face!

10:24.391 --> 10:27.493
It's time to drink up!

10:27.556 --> 10:30.056
It looks like you are the dweeb

10:30.123 --> 10:32.395
and Mn the cool guy.

10:38.419 --> 10:40.055
Is it too gross for you, man?

10:40.119 --> 10:41.562
No, no.

10:41.618 --> 10:43.322
I got to take what's
coming to me.

10:46.750 --> 10:49.659
Hey, it's not that bad!
I like it!

10:49.715 --> 10:53.022
- What?!
- You want a taste?

10:54.912 --> 10:56.412
Ah, it's gross!

10:56.479 --> 10:58.718
In your face, dweeb!
