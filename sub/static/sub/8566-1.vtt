01:10.086 --> 01:11.725
<i>Fear...</i>

01:12.689 --> 01:15.920
<i>a little death that consumes you.</i>

01:16.392 --> 01:21.198
<i>From the common to the abstract,
everyone is scared of something.</i>

01:21.998 --> 01:24.267
I got a cockroach.
Somebody kill it. Somebody kill it.

01:24.367 --> 01:26.669
Somebody kill it. Kill it.

01:27.677 --> 01:31.541
<i>I was always taught
you had to live with it, accept it.</i>

01:31.641 --> 01:34.177
<i>I watched as others fought back.</i>

01:34.277 --> 01:38.815
<i>Agoraphobia, nyctophobia,
hydrophobia, acrophobia.</i>

01:38.915 --> 01:42.152
<i>There are literally thousands
of classified phobias.</i>

01:42.252 --> 01:46.056
<i>I figured out a way to give
my patients a fresh start</i>

01:46.156 --> 01:51.128
<i>without the inhibitions and restrictions
their phobias had placed in their lives.</i>

01:51.228 --> 01:55.698
Oh, the chamber here animates
your phobias in the form of hallucinations.

01:56.587 --> 01:57.667
No!

01:57.967 --> 02:01.704
<i>Total immersive exposure therapy,</i>

02:02.304 --> 02:04.338
<i>that's where I went...</i>

02:06.309 --> 02:09.913
<i>pushed to the edge of science
and sensory deprivation.</i>

02:10.513 --> 02:13.516
<i>We had the technology
to find a cure all along,</i>

02:13.616 --> 02:16.586
<i>but everyone else was blind to it.</i>

02:16.686 --> 02:21.655
<i>Smarter men than me all failed,
but not me.</i>

02:22.959 --> 02:25.295
<i>My agenda was pure,</i>

02:25.395 --> 02:28.798
<i>and I figured out the key
hiding in plain sight,</i>

02:28.898 --> 02:31.701
<i>which they all had overlooked,</i>

02:32.692 --> 02:34.698
<i>the amygdala,</i>

02:34.798 --> 02:37.974
<i>the portion of the brain
which feels fear.</i>

02:39.542 --> 02:43.946
<i>Everyone else had danced around it
and treated it like something sacred,</i>

02:44.046 --> 02:47.750
<i>but I took a slightly
different approach.</i>

02:47.850 --> 02:51.754
<i>The amygdala also acts
as a kind of projector</i>

02:51.854 --> 02:55.257
<i>in which the signal
can easily be received</i>

02:55.557 --> 02:58.526
<i>and, most of all, bounced back.</i>

03:02.865 --> 03:03.831
<i>It was working.</i>

03:05.234 --> 03:08.805
<i>Round after round,
I was fighting fear and winning.</i>

03:08.905 --> 03:10.474
No!

03:11.474 --> 03:14.985
<i>Some of my colleagues tried to debunk
my theories, calling me insane,</i>

03:15.085 --> 03:18.879
<i>dangerous, outrageous,
but they were just jealous.</i>

03:26.122 --> 03:29.626
<i>But something, something went wrong.</i>

03:38.034 --> 03:40.537
Now close your eyes,

03:41.222 --> 03:43.339
and just concentrate

03:44.155 --> 03:47.074
on the sound of my voice.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.690
Which one do you want? Strawberry?
Vanilla? Chocolate? What?

04:00.790 --> 04:02.290
- Vanilla.
- Vanilla?

04:23.179 --> 04:25.146
Don't do this. Please don't...

04:54.744 --> 04:56.177
Talk to me.

04:57.580 --> 04:59.516
I need you to tell me

05:00.279 --> 05:01.949
what you see.

05:03.519 --> 05:04.988
Nothing.

05:05.688 --> 05:07.755
Tell me what you see.

05:12.594 --> 05:14.297
A door.

05:15.154 --> 05:16.799
Good.

05:17.199 --> 05:19.466
Is it the door to the diner?

05:20.470 --> 05:22.305
I don't think so.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.740
That's it, Paige.

05:24.471 --> 05:27.644
Focus on the sound of my voice.

05:27.944 --> 05:32.046
Paige, you're not listening to me.
Focus!

05:36.022 --> 05:36.887
Paige...

05:38.587 --> 05:39.289
focus!

05:39.889 --> 05:41.524
That's it, Paige.

05:41.824 --> 05:44.961
- No.
- Focus on the sound of my voice.

05:45.061 --> 05:45.995
I'm scared.

05:49.565 --> 05:50.767
- Paige.
- No!

05:50.867 --> 05:54.637
Paige, it's just a hallucination.
All you need to do is open your eyes.

05:54.837 --> 05:56.172
Let me in.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.441
Paige! Paige!

05:58.541 --> 06:00.310
Open the door.

06:00.410 --> 06:02.912
All you need to do is open your eyes.

06:03.012 --> 06:06.082
Open your eyes, Paige.
Paige, open your eyes!

06:11.386 --> 06:14.422
Paige. Paige!

06:16.025 --> 06:16.791
Paige!

07:34.685 --> 07:37.279
Sara. Sara, are your lights out, too?

07:39.375 --> 07:40.276
I'm fine.

07:40.876 --> 07:43.379
Really? Why, 'cause you lit
a couple candles?

07:44.382 --> 07:47.784
You know what? I think I have bedbugs.
Could you check my neck? It's really itchy.

07:47.884 --> 07:51.018
I feel like I can feel them
crawling on me. It's just gross.

07:53.788 --> 07:56.793
- Right there.
- Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax.

07:58.094 --> 07:59.929
- Damn it.
- Nothing.

08:00.029 --> 08:01.898
- Really?
- Nothing except lice.

08:01.998 --> 08:04.965
Oh, fuck you.
Why don't you light some more candles?

08:06.168 --> 08:07.201
Shut up.

08:12.041 --> 08:14.276
So you got your hot date over there?

08:14.376 --> 08:16.612
He's warm enough, I guess.

08:16.912 --> 08:19.331
Remember that friend of his
I told you about?

08:19.431 --> 08:21.811
- No, I don't.
- You don't know what you're missing.

08:21.911 --> 08:28.086
No! Just let me finish grad school
and worry about all of that other stuff.

08:28.686 --> 08:31.594
- It's all about sacrifices.
- Sacrifices for the greater good.

08:31.694 --> 08:33.530
I know. You can spare me
the speech. Thank you.

08:33.630 --> 08:38.400
Shut up. I'll have the last laugh when I'm
a horribly underpaid teaching assistant.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.136
Thank God.

08:41.740 --> 08:44.474
Now get out, itchy bitch.
I have school in the morning.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.416
- You could teach this kid a thing or two.
- Get out.

08:47.516 --> 08:49.879
- What?
- Get out! Come on.

08:49.979 --> 08:54.116
Oh, come on. He's kind of hot
and edgy and dark.

08:54.216 --> 08:56.250
I know you like 'em dark.

08:57.353 --> 08:59.489
The darker, the better, bitch.

09:24.813 --> 09:25.846
Okay.

09:38.431 --> 09:40.362
Oh, God.

09:40.462 --> 09:41.895
God.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.339
Hello?

10:59.942 --> 11:02.612
It's not my fucking job!

11:02.712 --> 11:05.748
I'm not a fucking magician

11:05.848 --> 11:07.715
or mortician. I am...

11:09.485 --> 11:12.140
Osborn, are you fucking nuts?

11:12.688 --> 11:15.591
For the past few days,
I have gone above and beyond.

11:15.891 --> 11:17.972
I... yeah. Well, you know,

11:18.072 --> 11:20.763
it's just a matter of time
before the checks start fucking bouncing.

11:27.403 --> 11:30.006
- Hey.
- <i>Oh, my God. Where the fuck are you?</i>

11:30.106 --> 11:32.942
I'm... I'm at the clinic.

11:33.042 --> 11:35.211
<i>Please tell me
you're getting an abortion.</i>

11:35.311 --> 11:39.615
Look, I'm sure I'm fine.
I just... I wanted to talk to Andover.

11:39.715 --> 11:42.418
<i>What, you couldn't call?
You had to drive four hours?</i>

11:42.518 --> 11:45.254
Yeah, well, the place looks like shit.

11:45.354 --> 11:47.490
I'm not sure the fear business
is doing too well.

11:47.690 --> 11:50.626
<i>And I overheard Bauer on the phone.
I think that something happened here.</i>

11:50.926 --> 11:54.130
<i>God, I hate that convict creep.
He's so rapey.</i>

11:54.430 --> 11:58.100
<i>Listen to this shit. I saw this article
about this bug from Japan.</i>

11:58.200 --> 12:00.736
<i>It flies and shoots acid into your eyes.</i>

12:00.836 --> 12:03.506
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
I'll be home later.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.039
Great.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.551
Hello?

12:27.296 --> 12:29.244
Dr. Andover?

12:39.508 --> 12:41.308
Dr. Andover?

12:48.317 --> 12:51.387
Now, we discussed how important it is

12:51.487 --> 12:53.989
for you to revisit these images, right?

12:54.089 --> 12:58.828
Okay, just concentrate
on the sound of my voice,

12:58.928 --> 13:00.529
and breathe.

13:01.129 --> 13:02.515
Stop!

13:03.499 --> 13:06.247
Sara, it's not real!

13:13.776 --> 13:15.778
Dr. Andover?

13:33.762 --> 13:34.797
Dr. Andover.

13:35.706 --> 13:36.663
We're closed.

13:43.639 --> 13:45.739
Come on. Come on. You're okay.

13:49.178 --> 13:50.868
Come on.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.250
It's okay. Come on. Come on. Come on.

14:08.497 --> 14:10.132
Yo! Yo, can I get some help over here?

14:10.632 --> 14:12.969
- Excuse me?
- Yo, lady, I just drove five fucking hours.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.138
- I just need you to come...
- Wait. You're Dylan Dunn, right?

14:15.238 --> 14:19.175
Yeah. Yeah, that's me. Yeah.
Yeah, you're Sara. I remember you.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.678
Caylee's outside, and she's really sick.
She needs to see the doc right away.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.480
Caylee's here? What's wrong with Caylee?

14:24.580 --> 14:27.516
We gotta get her in a room.
We gotta get her to see the doc.

14:32.521 --> 14:35.035
Hey. Caylee.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.593
Why aren't you eating?

14:38.193 --> 14:40.160
I... I just can't.

14:41.697 --> 14:45.032
- Hey, listen, I'm gonna go get a drink.
- Yeah. I got her.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.492
Caylee, you were doing so well.

14:50.439 --> 14:52.949
Tell me, why aren't you really eating?

14:54.376 --> 14:56.009
I know.

14:57.913 --> 14:59.782
I know you saw it.

14:59.882 --> 15:02.038
You saw him, too.

15:07.022 --> 15:08.525
What?

15:10.926 --> 15:12.995
Hello! Can I get some help?

15:13.195 --> 15:14.496
Caylee, are you okay?

15:14.996 --> 15:16.763
What the hell is this shit?

15:16.863 --> 15:18.901
Get her prepped, please.

15:20.717 --> 15:23.130
- We're closed.
- Caylee. Caylee.

15:23.230 --> 15:25.574
Here. I got her. I got her.
Come here. Come on.

15:26.074 --> 15:28.482
Come on. Get up. Get up.

15:29.111 --> 15:30.402
We got you.

15:50.232 --> 15:52.568
What makes you think
you had a fear aftershock?

15:53.527 --> 15:55.771
I mean, but it was so...

15:56.236 --> 15:57.704
real.

15:59.008 --> 16:01.743
Like the mask, the gun.

16:01.843 --> 16:04.213
I could smell the gunpowder.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.389
Okay, within days of being
in the chamber, Sara, sure,

16:07.489 --> 16:10.019
but you haven't had a session in a year.

16:10.119 --> 16:12.588
It's... it's unheard of.

16:12.988 --> 16:17.226
There hasn't been one documented case
of fear aftershocks reemerging

16:17.326 --> 16:19.261
since he built the chamber 20 years ago.

16:19.361 --> 16:22.764
I don't understand why
I can't talk to Dr. Andover.

16:23.064 --> 16:25.468
You know, what was that thing
that he was in?

16:25.568 --> 16:27.637
Don't worry about that.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.272
It's always been a
secret part of his process.

16:30.372 --> 16:31.874
What do you mean?

16:32.374 --> 16:34.909
Even though he can't see what you see,

16:35.009 --> 16:37.479
it still takes a heavy
emotional toll on him.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.815
Well, then why doesn't he just go
into the chamber himself?

16:39.915 --> 16:44.053
Because it'd be counterproductive,
I mean, possibly even dangerous.

16:44.153 --> 16:46.388
He's the only one
who knows how to run it.

16:47.188 --> 16:50.423
He'd be the first to tell you, Sara,
he has no fear to treat.

16:51.627 --> 16:55.164
I don't know what's going on here,
but our fears are coming back.

16:55.264 --> 17:00.002
And what is this black stuff
she projectile-vomited all over me?

17:00.202 --> 17:04.205
At first, I thought it was
stomach bile, but it's thicker,

17:04.506 --> 17:06.071
more viscous.

17:07.509 --> 17:12.112
All I can tell you, Sara, is we've never
seen anything like it at the clinic.

17:18.354 --> 17:20.359
Is there something
you're not telling me?

17:22.858 --> 17:24.290
It's Paige.

17:25.861 --> 17:26.859
Paige Peterson?

17:29.664 --> 17:30.597
She's dead.

17:33.668 --> 17:36.813
- What do you mean? She was better. I...
- She was better...

17:36.913 --> 17:38.774
for a while.

17:38.874 --> 17:42.777
She came back months later
insisting on talking to Andover.

17:42.877 --> 17:44.873
Just like me now.

17:47.349 --> 17:48.650
Did she die in the chamber?

17:48.750 --> 17:52.700
I... Sara, I can't give you any more details,
Sara. I've already said too much.

17:54.523 --> 17:57.326
And I'm afraid you're wasting
your time here.

17:58.026 --> 18:01.130
Look, I can't go backwards.

18:01.630 --> 18:03.799
I put up with those hallucinations
in the chamber.

18:03.899 --> 18:06.524
I slept with the lights on.
I did everything.

18:07.269 --> 18:10.172
Caylee is clearly sick, okay?

18:10.272 --> 18:11.871
I'm not leaving.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.311
S...

18:14.611 --> 18:16.155
Sara.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.166
<i>Rewind. When did you know</i>

18:37.266 --> 18:39.868
<i>that you could take the lead
and finish it out strong?</i>

18:40.468 --> 18:43.072
<i>From the beginning.
I don't question it. I don't question it.</i>

18:43.172 --> 18:45.708
<i>You just keep riding hard. You stay focused.
You keep doing it, you're gonna win,</i>

18:45.808 --> 18:48.343
<i>you're gonna win, and that's
what I do. Done. Did it.</i>

18:49.043 --> 18:50.612
<i>Another trophy for your mantel...</i>

18:50.912 --> 18:53.015
Try to relax, okay.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.609
We're gonna get you something
for your pain, okay? Just relax.

19:05.627 --> 19:09.098
Okay, I'm afraid Caylee is much sicker
than when we initially treated her.

19:09.198 --> 19:11.433
Her sitophobia and body
dysmorphic disorder

19:11.533 --> 19:13.878
have reached a point she could die
if she doesn't start eating.

19:13.978 --> 19:16.005
I don't get it. She was cured
when we were here last year.

19:16.105 --> 19:17.473
Why can't you treat her
with traditional means?

19:17.573 --> 19:19.141
I'd have to run more tests to find out.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.542
Why don't you just put her
in the damn chamber?

19:20.642 --> 19:22.911
It's not an option, apparently.

19:23.011 --> 19:25.499
Why? That's the reason why we came here.
Where the hell's the doctor?

19:25.599 --> 19:27.121
He's supposed to be here.
Why won't he see her?

19:27.221 --> 19:29.752
I understand. Listen, between us,
I'm working on a backup plan

19:29.852 --> 19:33.355
and hoping Andover will get onboard.
Caylee's life may depend on it.

19:33.455 --> 19:35.024
He needs to get his head out of his ass.

19:35.124 --> 19:38.327
Listen, I'm gonna stay and help
with Caylee. You don't have...

19:38.427 --> 19:41.163
maybe a clean shirt and a few vacancies?

19:41.263 --> 19:43.168
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

20:05.687 --> 20:10.156
I have done as you asked...

20:11.527 --> 20:15.063
you promised me. You promised me.

20:15.163 --> 20:17.464
Give me what I want.

20:18.433 --> 20:20.934
Please. I need it.

20:26.189 --> 20:28.243
Paige Peterson, addendum.

20:29.068 --> 20:31.544
This afternoon, I just...

20:40.021 --> 20:43.223
You have time for a bubble bath,
but not to talk to me?

20:47.396 --> 20:49.529
I'm sorry. I just...

20:51.066 --> 20:53.702
I don't understand what's going on here.

20:53.802 --> 20:55.804
You and me both.

20:55.904 --> 21:00.542
Things have been rather
trying around here lately.

21:01.142 --> 21:03.176
I heard about Paige.

21:04.413 --> 21:06.014
It was an accident.

21:06.214 --> 21:08.481
- Right?
- No.

21:10.152 --> 21:12.861
I was responsible for her, Sara.

21:13.521 --> 21:16.191
I wanted to help her.
I wanted to help all of you.

21:16.391 --> 21:18.026
You did help me.

21:18.826 --> 21:20.861
You saved my life.

21:27.435 --> 21:28.468
I saw the shooter.

21:30.605 --> 21:31.638
The shooter?

21:36.778 --> 21:38.547
No, that... that's never
happened before.

21:38.647 --> 21:42.351
Prolonged aftershock, I know.
Osborn schooled me.

21:43.151 --> 21:46.021
I think it's time for one more session.

21:46.321 --> 21:49.558
Paige was just one more session.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.394
Everything was just fine,

21:52.594 --> 21:57.599
and then she somehow lost her way.
She lost me. I...

21:57.699 --> 21:59.868
she was beyond my reach.

22:00.168 --> 22:03.571
Sara, I nursed her for months.

22:03.771 --> 22:08.914
She didn't require oxygen. She didn't need
life support. How's that possible?

22:09.744 --> 22:11.747
I could tell.

22:11.847 --> 22:15.837
I could see that she was still
suffering, that...

22:16.137 --> 22:17.917
she was still terrified.

22:20.522 --> 22:22.624
How did it end?

22:22.724 --> 22:26.726
I simply closed her eyes.

22:31.833 --> 22:33.967
And she was gone.

22:35.404 --> 22:38.206
I really appreciate
your wanting to help.

22:38.906 --> 22:41.058
I really do, but...

22:43.138 --> 22:46.071
I just can't do this anymore.

22:46.248 --> 22:50.918
So if you'll excuse me,
I have some things I need to do.

22:53.622 --> 22:58.527
Do you know that Caylee is throwing up
whatever black stuff that is in your vial?

22:59.427 --> 23:01.828
You'd know that if you
came out of your office.

23:03.998 --> 23:07.103
And unfortunately, Dr. Andover,
I'm not leaving.

23:07.903 --> 23:10.648
The Fear Clinic is open for business.

23:14.242 --> 23:17.679
Nobody can find out about this,
or we're in deep shit.

23:17.879 --> 23:20.782
Dang! Fuck! I hate that fucking shit!

23:20.882 --> 23:25.051
Well, that's Osborn's problem.
She can break it to the doc.

23:28.890 --> 23:30.459
Son of a bitch.

23:30.579 --> 23:32.995
You stole millions of dollars
worth of power

23:33.095 --> 23:36.231
juicing up illegal grow farms.
You mean to tell me this is a challenge?

23:36.331 --> 23:38.734
You know what?
Your fucking mama is a challenge.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.319
Here's what I think. Why don't we just
get this son of a bitch back upstairs,

23:41.419 --> 23:42.972
and I'll piggyback the breakout box?

23:43.072 --> 23:46.875
Fuck no. Look, for one,
Andover destroyed the...

23:46.975 --> 23:51.613
whatever power supply was up there.
You need to figure something out, and fast.

23:52.113 --> 23:54.249
How much you say she was
cutting us a check for?

23:54.349 --> 23:57.652
So much we'll never have
to work here again

23:57.752 --> 23:59.754
or do anything that winds us
back in the joint.

24:00.254 --> 24:01.489
Well, that's a good thing.

24:01.589 --> 24:04.326
Ooh, sexy bitches

24:04.426 --> 24:07.129
Are my favorite kind of bitches.

24:08.396 --> 24:10.999
You dumb-ass. I hate that song.

24:11.099 --> 24:12.734
I daisy-chain a couple,
three gennies together,

24:12.834 --> 24:14.803
I can have this thing
up and running by dinnertime.

24:14.903 --> 24:16.870
- Boom.
- I'll be back.

24:18.840 --> 24:20.106
Yes.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.884
Hey. Baby, listen.

24:29.884 --> 24:32.888
They're gonna keep you here
overnight for observation.

24:33.388 --> 24:36.458
Well, they're gonna make you better.
They're gonna fix you.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.727
They're gonna do it
without that Fear Chamber.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.061
No.

24:40.861 --> 24:44.997
You have to get me in there,
no matter what it takes.

24:45.097 --> 24:49.138
- You want to lose me?
- Fuck no, I don't want to lose you.

24:50.459 --> 24:53.979
God, I feel like I've already
lost too much of you. I...

24:54.819 --> 24:56.364
All right.

24:56.964 --> 24:58.419
All right, I'm gonna get you in there.

24:59.514 --> 25:01.735
I'd do anything for you.

25:05.887 --> 25:07.753
I like that.

27:46.314 --> 27:47.616
Paige?

27:49.126 --> 27:51.117
Where are we?

27:51.786 --> 27:53.688
What happened to you?

27:53.988 --> 27:56.257
In the chamber, what happened?

27:56.457 --> 27:59.225
You thought you were building a box.

27:59.961 --> 28:02.263
You built a door instead.

28:03.063 --> 28:06.297
Door? What door?

28:08.148 --> 28:10.303
A door for me.

28:11.906 --> 28:15.064
Every time you put someone
in that thing...

28:16.244 --> 28:18.113
it made more cracks,

28:18.513 --> 28:22.250
so I peeked through
the cracks you made...

28:23.371 --> 28:26.152
became a little easier to turn.

28:30.758 --> 28:32.425
I won't let you through again.

28:55.450 --> 28:58.044
Paige Peterson,

28:58.444 --> 29:00.209
female,

29:00.328 --> 29:02.423
age 26,

29:03.323 --> 29:04.926
deceased.

29:05.626 --> 29:08.763
This black substance

29:08.863 --> 29:12.249
seems to induce

29:12.349 --> 29:15.836
hallucinations upon contact, which...

29:16.636 --> 29:20.108
leads me to believe
that it's some kind of...

29:20.208 --> 29:22.043
phobic residue,

29:22.243 --> 29:23.878
a fear waste, if you will.

29:24.678 --> 29:28.214
Why hasn't it manifested itself
before now?

29:34.522 --> 29:36.255
Caylee.

29:47.902 --> 29:49.369
Caylee.

30:08.323 --> 30:10.022
Caylee.

31:02.076 --> 31:04.010
Show me.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.319
Where?

31:18.059 --> 31:20.560
I understand.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.186
If that's what you want.

32:10.244 --> 32:13.846
I am fucking hungry.
How are you feeling? You hungry?

32:15.550 --> 32:18.319
You know my mom's doing
that whole dinner thing tonight, right?

32:18.419 --> 32:19.954
Yeah. I gotta eat something
before then, though.

32:20.054 --> 32:22.190
We could just go grab something
somewhere close.

32:22.290 --> 32:23.391
- What's up, buddy?
- Hey, hey. What's up, dude?

32:23.491 --> 32:27.495
- I just saw you on the video.
- Oh, yeah? How'd my hair look?

32:27.595 --> 32:29.998
I don't know.
You were wearing a helmet, stupid.

32:30.098 --> 32:31.230
Oh, you're so...

32:40.341 --> 32:41.676
It was so cool, though.

32:41.776 --> 32:43.878
And when are you going
to teach me those awesome flips?

32:43.978 --> 32:48.750
No way. Your sister would fuck...
freaking kill me. Can't do that.

32:48.850 --> 32:52.754
Hey, brat, you want a milkshake
over at Eli's?

32:52.854 --> 32:54.155
Are you kidding? It's freezing.

32:54.255 --> 32:56.724
Hey, come on. Don't be a wuss.
It's warm in there.

32:56.824 --> 32:59.627
Come on. What do you say? Milkshake?

32:59.727 --> 33:00.562
- Fine.
- Fine.

33:00.662 --> 33:02.030
- Done deal.
- Done deal.

33:02.130 --> 33:04.420
- Ooh. Come on.
- Let's go.

33:36.330 --> 33:39.632
Shit, honey. Sorry about this.

33:41.302 --> 33:44.272
Hate these damn things.
Always chewing up my wires.

33:47.141 --> 33:48.007
Hey.

33:49.844 --> 33:51.510
Know how you catch a unique squirrel?

33:54.915 --> 33:56.785
Unique up on him.

34:36.791 --> 34:41.928
<i>Osborn, please come to the reception area
for patient intake. Osborn.</i>

34:54.101 --> 34:55.908
Mrs. Patton.

34:57.349 --> 35:00.882
I'm Osborn, the head therapist here,
specializing in PTSD.

35:00.982 --> 35:03.983
- So happy you could make it out.
- Of course.

35:08.256 --> 35:09.854
Hi.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.293
I'm Sara.

35:18.098 --> 35:21.436
He hasn't spoken
since the shooting, I'm afraid.

35:22.333 --> 35:23.202
Blake.

35:39.887 --> 35:43.591
Why don't we get you in an exam room
and get you all settled in?

35:43.791 --> 35:44.757
Bauer.

35:50.564 --> 35:52.596
Till then, you want to have a seat?

35:55.703 --> 35:58.537
I have to admit,
this is not what I expected.

36:02.576 --> 36:04.729
Wasn't always like this.

36:05.513 --> 36:07.680
You've been here before?

36:09.283 --> 36:11.862
I came here after the incident myself.

36:13.320 --> 36:16.822
Dr. Andover really helped me.
He cured me of my scotophobia.

36:18.092 --> 36:20.993
I'm sorry. It's fear of the dark.

36:23.063 --> 36:26.801
So why did you bring Blake here now?

36:27.922 --> 36:29.504
Well, at night...

36:30.004 --> 36:32.007
just for a few minutes, not every night,

36:33.107 --> 36:35.076
it's like he sees something

36:35.576 --> 36:37.478
and it really scares him.

36:37.978 --> 36:41.819
He sees something
relating to the incident?

36:41.919 --> 36:43.317
I don't know.

36:44.017 --> 36:48.189
I know nothing can bring him back now,
not the way he was.

36:48.289 --> 36:52.761
But I can't stand the thought of him
being terrorized by something

36:53.261 --> 36:55.127
and then not knowing what it is.

36:57.064 --> 36:59.708
I think he's in the right place.

37:23.023 --> 37:25.698
<i>Do you know that that kid
can barely move,</i>

37:25.798 --> 37:27.828
<i>but hurts himself every night,
he's so scared?</i>

37:27.928 --> 37:30.998
Yes, I promise you
we are gonna help Blake.

37:31.798 --> 37:34.769
How? By giving him fucking fluids

37:34.869 --> 37:36.738
- and a lollipop like Caylee?
- Keep your voice down.

37:36.838 --> 37:39.573
No! This is bullshit, and you know it.

37:39.673 --> 37:44.089
That kid is suffering. Caylee is on the brink
of death, and he's too chickenshit

37:44.189 --> 37:46.078
- to use the chamber?
- Sara.

37:47.415 --> 37:49.884
He said he'd never fail us, right?

37:49.984 --> 37:53.152
Well, he's failing us right fucking now.

38:38.265 --> 38:39.632
Before you get angry...

38:42.302 --> 38:44.770
this is your life's work.

38:46.007 --> 38:51.042
I had it repaired for good reason,
and two of them are in the waiting room.

38:52.713 --> 38:56.651
What you and this box have done
for me and my claustrophobia,

38:56.751 --> 38:59.420
for all the people you've helped,

38:59.520 --> 39:01.989
it is not over, and you know that.

39:04.065 --> 39:07.122
In over 20 years,
I've never had reason to doubt

39:07.222 --> 39:09.872
that this was anything but a cure,

39:10.297 --> 39:12.099
a magic bullet.

39:13.361 --> 39:14.969
I thought I did everything right.

39:15.069 --> 39:18.205
And you did. It was a terrible accident.

39:18.305 --> 39:21.709
Paige was a tragedy, and it's...
it's not gonna happen again.

39:21.809 --> 39:25.544
I don't want anyone else hurt.

39:28.115 --> 39:30.117
We can save this boy,

39:30.217 --> 39:32.520
another victim of that shooting,

39:32.620 --> 39:37.525
one that was hurt so badly,
he flew under our radar all this time.

39:37.825 --> 39:41.529
Can't we give his mother some peace
and let her know what's tormenting him?

39:41.629 --> 39:44.320
I don't know if I can. I...

39:45.332 --> 39:46.632
I don't know.

39:48.469 --> 39:49.968
You can.

39:52.940 --> 39:54.517
You can.

39:55.709 --> 39:58.832
You can, and then you'll see

39:58.932 --> 40:01.413
there's nothing to be afraid of.

40:04.218 --> 40:06.232
Don't worry, Doctor.

40:11.058 --> 40:12.865
Have a little faith.

40:26.907 --> 40:29.410
I don't understand.
Why are we taking the stairs?

40:29.510 --> 40:31.376
Elevator's out.

40:34.715 --> 40:37.318
And why is it in the basement?

40:38.018 --> 40:39.863
Elevator's out.

40:48.729 --> 40:50.231
All ready to leave you to it, Doctor.

40:50.331 --> 40:53.409
No, please, you stay this time.
Given the...

40:54.009 --> 40:58.038
given the patient's condition,
this is new territory for both of us.

40:58.138 --> 40:59.371
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

41:00.341 --> 41:01.275
Right this way.

41:01.375 --> 41:04.145
The chamber is a very private experience
for our patients.

41:04.245 --> 41:06.347
It's imperative
for Dr. Andover's concentration

41:06.447 --> 41:08.282
that he has no distractions
during the session.

41:08.382 --> 41:11.285
- Well, aren't you going to put him to sleep?
- We don't deal in dreams here.

41:11.385 --> 41:14.052
At no time are our patients ever asleep.

41:28.736 --> 41:29.818
Now...

41:31.118 --> 41:33.016
close your eyes,

41:33.116 --> 41:38.260
and just listen to the sound
of my voice.

41:39.179 --> 41:42.750
I need you to relax and listen

41:42.850 --> 41:46.118
to the sound of my voice.

41:47.721 --> 41:50.088
We're going back,

41:50.924 --> 41:52.960
back to the restaurant

41:53.360 --> 41:55.663
on the day of the shooting.

41:56.063 --> 42:00.799
The restaurant is full of people
eating dinner.

42:03.103 --> 42:05.471
Blake, what do you see?

42:08.142 --> 42:09.308
Blake?

42:10.693 --> 42:12.562
Are you there yet?

42:16.983 --> 42:20.588
- Blake, focus.
- Don't do this. Please don't...

42:21.455 --> 42:25.193
Focus, Blake.
Blake, you're not focusing.

42:25.393 --> 42:28.028
His heart rate is elevated.
Do you want to stop, Doctor?

42:28.128 --> 42:29.930
No. Blake.

42:30.630 --> 42:33.198
- Blake!
- What's happening?

42:35.202 --> 42:37.484
- Bauer, would you come get her, please?
- Is he okay?

42:37.584 --> 42:40.138
It's okay. Ma'am,
I need you to come with me.

42:46.013 --> 42:47.045
Penlight.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.124
It's okay, Blake. We're gonna get you
out of here in just a second.

42:56.424 --> 42:57.591
Bauer, his chair.

43:05.365 --> 43:06.798
We got you. We got you.

43:34.562 --> 43:38.832
<i>Hey, you've reached Megan.
Leave a message, and I might call you back.</i>

43:39.432 --> 43:43.504
Megan, will you please call me back, please?
I'm really starting to get worried.

43:43.654 --> 43:45.904
- Fuck.
- Girlfriend trouble?

43:49.176 --> 43:52.513
Listen, I need access to a car.

43:52.913 --> 43:55.182
Well, I could probably do that.

43:55.582 --> 43:57.518
But it'll cost you.

43:58.272 --> 43:59.520
Fuck off.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.937
Is there a problem here?

44:03.523 --> 44:05.234
Oh, no, sir. We're just...
we're just kidding around.

44:05.334 --> 44:08.562
I can't find Megan. It's been, like,
six hours. She's not answering her phone.

44:09.062 --> 44:10.731
Mr. Bauer,

44:10.931 --> 44:12.693
you will go get the young lady.

44:14.134 --> 44:16.970
- Now.
- Yeah, okay, sir.

44:17.270 --> 44:18.505
All right.

44:18.605 --> 44:21.673
Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir. Sorry.

44:24.011 --> 44:25.844
Thank you.

44:32.620 --> 44:34.522
I don't fucking get you guys
with this chamber thing.

44:34.622 --> 44:35.923
You guys are all freaking obsessed.

44:36.716 --> 44:38.290
You don't get it.

44:40.861 --> 44:43.363
Everything fades once you're in there.

44:44.392 --> 44:48.033
You don't have to be afraid
of anything anymore.

44:50.141 --> 44:51.872
It's bullshit.

44:51.972 --> 44:53.774
What do you mean?

44:54.174 --> 44:56.257
All right, fear
is a primal thing, right?

44:56.357 --> 44:59.747
Hey, babies were born with it.
It's part of our damn genetic code.

45:00.547 --> 45:04.218
We've evolved and we have survived
because of it.

45:04.418 --> 45:07.921
I know all about fear,
and it's got no place in my world.

45:08.121 --> 45:11.425
And now you've got some fucking guy who
builds this box, and he wants to play God,

45:11.525 --> 45:15.193
and he wants to start digging around
in our heads and shit. No way.

45:16.363 --> 45:19.399
No. I'm pure instinct.
I don't need no fucking box.

45:19.499 --> 45:21.769
Yeah, well, you're not getting in mine.

45:21.869 --> 45:24.004
- You were a patient, right?
- No, I wasn't a patient here.

45:24.104 --> 45:26.373
I was in that thing once.
I was only here one time.

45:26.473 --> 45:29.225
It's just she used to show us videos
of all that crazy shit you did with bikes.

45:29.325 --> 45:31.246
Oh, yeah? Well, what's he got
to say about his first ride?

45:32.346 --> 45:34.615
Now, that wasn't very nice, now, was it?

45:34.915 --> 45:38.018
Hey, don't be an asshole.

45:38.965 --> 45:41.853
Yeah, we're gonna go back
and eat inside.

45:45.359 --> 45:47.528
All it takes is one trigger-happy fuck,
and next thing you know,

45:47.628 --> 45:50.829
you got nobody to push the buttons
on the control panel.

46:07.747 --> 46:10.118
Have a little respect.

46:10.818 --> 46:11.886
Just a little.

46:12.486 --> 46:15.853
Guess he wasn't as lucky
as the rest of us that night.

46:48.398 --> 46:50.558
Help. Hello. Somebody, hello.

46:50.658 --> 46:53.024
<i>Megan, your old room's waiting for you.</i>

46:57.908 --> 47:00.467
- There you go.
- Super!

47:02.135 --> 47:05.971
I missed you, Megan. You're like
a ray of fucking sunshine in my day.

47:11.278 --> 47:14.748
As usual, you guys corner
the market on hospitality.

47:17.384 --> 47:21.553
Hospitality. I'll fucking show you
hospi-fucking-tality.

47:26.694 --> 47:28.229
Sexy bitches...

47:36.803 --> 47:38.138
Oh, thank God.

47:40.474 --> 47:42.976
I was so worried about you.
Are you okay?

47:43.076 --> 47:45.912
Yeah. I don't know. I...

47:46.012 --> 47:48.713
I just thought it would
pass on its own, I guess.

47:49.449 --> 47:52.786
I've got so much to tell you.

48:02.012 --> 48:03.530
Hey, babe.

48:03.730 --> 48:06.633
I'm gonna take a shower.
I'll see you after your session, 'kay?

48:06.733 --> 48:08.302
Come here.

48:08.702 --> 48:12.139
- Come here.
- What's up? You okay?

48:12.239 --> 48:15.243
- No.
- No? What's wrong?

48:18.645 --> 48:20.212
Come on.

48:33.994 --> 48:37.848
Now just focus

48:37.948 --> 48:40.866
on the sound of my voice.

48:43.604 --> 48:44.968
Now...

48:45.668 --> 48:47.783
you're going back.

48:48.408 --> 48:50.408
You're going to return...

48:51.378 --> 48:53.144
to the restaurant.

48:56.416 --> 48:58.385
Are you there?

48:58.685 --> 49:00.988
Are you in the restaurant?

49:01.388 --> 49:04.623
You see your boyfriend. You see Dylan.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.163
I'm safe.

49:09.463 --> 49:11.465
I see them.

49:12.165 --> 49:13.734
Caylee,

49:13.834 --> 49:18.271
I need you to tell me exactly
where you are.

49:23.844 --> 49:25.612
I'm safe.

49:25.812 --> 49:26.678
Good.

49:28.182 --> 49:33.406
So now it's just a few moments
before the incident.

49:35.355 --> 49:38.756
Do you see anyone approaching the door?

49:39.759 --> 49:41.405
I can see him.

49:42.796 --> 49:45.132
Can you see your brother?

49:46.500 --> 49:49.567
Do you see little Kevin
sitting opposite you?

49:52.172 --> 49:54.947
I can see him.

49:55.542 --> 49:56.744
What's he wearing?

50:00.947 --> 50:03.083
Picture it, Caylee.

50:03.183 --> 50:06.086
What are you eating? Picture everything.

50:06.186 --> 50:10.358
I don't want to remember everything.
I can't. That's not what I'm supposed to do.

50:10.458 --> 50:15.109
Yes, that's precisely what you're
supposed to do. Now trust me.

50:19.499 --> 50:21.368
Now look to your brother.

50:22.673 --> 50:23.735
No!

50:25.872 --> 50:28.041
- I can't.
- Caylee, look at Kevin.

50:28.241 --> 50:29.407
Get me out of here!

50:31.511 --> 50:33.580
I want you to picture everything.

50:37.918 --> 50:41.421
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!

50:43.833 --> 50:45.792
Caylee. Caylee,

50:46.292 --> 50:50.380
I know it's painful for you to relive
that day, but you can't hide from it.

50:50.480 --> 50:52.599
I'll have Gage help you
to your room, Caylee. Just relax.

50:52.699 --> 50:56.770
What the fuck was that?
That wasn't supposed to happen.

50:57.370 --> 50:59.138
He promised me!

50:59.238 --> 51:02.443
- Come on. Come on, hon. Let me help you out.
- You fuck. Get off of me! Get off!

51:02.543 --> 51:04.344
- Okay.
- I'm not a fucking cripple!

51:04.444 --> 51:05.779
- I'm not the one in the wheelchair.
- Okay. Okay.

51:05.879 --> 51:07.735
Move! Move!

51:13.220 --> 51:15.936
That wasn't about food at all, was it?

51:16.323 --> 51:19.726
No. No, it certainly was not.

51:29.703 --> 51:31.038
Hey.

51:31.738 --> 51:33.446
You mind if I come in?

51:44.717 --> 51:46.484
It's okay.

51:57.297 --> 51:58.729
You want to know a secret?

52:01.468 --> 52:03.735
I was always afraid of the dark...

52:05.739 --> 52:07.908
ever since I was a little kid

52:08.008 --> 52:10.177
in my bedroom.

52:11.415 --> 52:13.647
And then when the shooting happened...

52:15.882 --> 52:17.317
the guy followed me,

52:18.317 --> 52:21.055
you know, like me and only me

52:21.455 --> 52:23.922
when he started shooting out the lights.

52:27.426 --> 52:29.830
And, you know, at that moment,

52:30.430 --> 52:32.559
I wasn't even scared of him.

52:37.704 --> 52:39.737
I was scared of the dark.

52:41.108 --> 52:44.709
I was scared of monsters in the dark.

52:46.579 --> 52:48.146
Anyway...

52:50.484 --> 52:53.156
Dr. Andover really helped me.

52:54.421 --> 52:56.690
Until lately.

52:57.090 --> 53:01.681
I'm starting to think maybe it's smart
to be scared of the dark.

53:17.244 --> 53:18.676
S'okay.

53:23.450 --> 53:26.055
S'okay, be...

53:27.101 --> 53:28.719
S'okay.

53:31.058 --> 53:32.525
I se...

53:32.625 --> 53:35.993
I see monsters...

53:36.996 --> 53:39.566
too. I see mons...

53:39.666 --> 53:41.702
Blake.

53:46.038 --> 53:48.539
Sara, Dr. Andover
would like to speak to you.

53:56.082 --> 53:58.950
Hey. I'll be right back.

54:08.360 --> 54:09.927
Blake?

54:11.564 --> 54:13.476
Blake, are you okay?

54:16.269 --> 54:17.502
What's wrong, Blake?

54:59.050 --> 55:00.517
Fuck!

55:00.880 --> 55:02.613
Take it easy.

55:22.535 --> 55:23.770
Yeah.

55:25.872 --> 55:29.075
Hard. Hard. Hard.

55:30.248 --> 55:33.909
Hurt me. Fucking hurt me. Fuck!

55:34.213 --> 55:35.982
Harder. Oh, harder.

55:36.082 --> 55:38.021
- Hard...
- Caylee, what the fuck... fuck is...

55:38.585 --> 55:42.022
fuck is wrong with you?
Fuck, can't we just be normal for once?

55:42.122 --> 55:45.025
Get out. Get out!

55:45.125 --> 55:47.260
You're fucking useless.

55:47.360 --> 55:50.428
- This is fucking bullshit.
- Get out.

56:07.080 --> 56:09.649
He's moving again. He's talking.

56:09.749 --> 56:12.483
- I know.
- Blake moved.

56:15.355 --> 56:20.124
- His brain activity has tripled.
- Why can't you see that that's amazing?

56:20.994 --> 56:27.435
Because, Sara, what's happening
here to Blake simply isn't possible.

56:29.335 --> 56:31.438
The chamber wasn't designed
to work that way.

56:31.538 --> 56:36.042
The chamber doesn't cure gunshot wounds.
It simply opens a door

56:36.142 --> 56:39.779
into a portion of the brain that most people
keep locked away. That's it.

56:39.879 --> 56:43.183
Then why did you tell his mother that
you thought he was going to be helped?

56:43.283 --> 56:47.131
Yes, I thought perhaps we could
improve his... his function a fraction

56:47.231 --> 56:50.890
using sensory techniques.
But this? Oh, no.

56:50.990 --> 56:55.495
- This is impossible. This is dangerous.
- Or it's a miracle.

56:55.895 --> 56:59.399
Or and if it's not a miracle,
it's a really fucking great side effect.

56:59.499 --> 57:02.870
I honestly don't understand
why you're not calling medical journals

57:02.970 --> 57:04.838
and telling them that it works again.

57:04.938 --> 57:07.507
Because I invented the goddamn thing.

57:07.607 --> 57:10.402
I know what it's capable of.

57:12.377 --> 57:14.045
Look, maybe this will make sense.

57:35.301 --> 57:37.091
Blakey? Blakey?

57:37.391 --> 57:39.572
Blakey! Baby, are you okay?

57:40.307 --> 57:42.809
Oh, baby. What? What?

57:42.909 --> 57:46.179
What do you see? What?
What, honey? What's the matter?

57:46.279 --> 57:48.114
You're okay. You're okay.
You're with Mommy.

57:48.214 --> 57:51.086
Mommy's here. Mommy's here.

57:51.186 --> 57:52.751
Mommy's here.

57:55.722 --> 57:57.557
This is the amygdala.

57:57.657 --> 58:02.462
It's the part of the brain where the emotion
of fear is generated from.

58:02.562 --> 58:05.685
And until today... until today,

58:05.785 --> 58:10.203
Blake's entire frontal lobe
was severely damaged by that bullet...

58:10.403 --> 58:13.706
utterly, totally unresponsive.

58:14.306 --> 58:16.910
I think this is about the chamber.

58:17.010 --> 58:18.912
I think it's doing something
to all of you.

58:19.012 --> 58:21.548
I think it's doing it for a reason.

58:23.508 --> 58:26.152
Sara. Sara, don't look at me like that.

58:26.252 --> 58:27.894
Listen, I know this sounds crazy,

58:27.994 --> 58:31.453
especially coming
from a man of science, but...

58:32.525 --> 58:35.695
I'm truly afraid that there could be

58:35.795 --> 58:39.864
a malevolent entity at work here.

58:41.534 --> 58:43.937
You can't quit.

58:44.437 --> 58:46.398
It's not an option.

58:52.011 --> 58:57.315
Besides, what reason would a malevolent
force have for making Blake smarter?

59:09.529 --> 59:14.246
<i>...what reason would a malevolent force
have for making Blake smarter?</i>

59:19.606 --> 59:23.774
So that he can be made
to feel fear again.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:08.889
How bad is it?

01:00:13.926 --> 01:00:15.476
It's not that bad.

01:00:17.196 --> 01:00:19.578
I need you to take a deep breath.
All right, Megan?

01:00:19.678 --> 01:00:23.002
- I'm going to have to cut this. Okay?
- Okay.

01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:28.342
Okay, just take a deep breath, okay?

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:31.103
Relax. Breathe. Breathe.

01:00:32.678 --> 01:00:35.982
You're gonna feel some pressure now.
All right? I have to squeeze it.

01:00:36.082 --> 01:00:39.608
- Oh, God. It hurts.
- I know, sweetie. Just take a deep breath.

01:00:39.708 --> 01:00:42.422
Please stay still, Megan, okay?
Calm down, sweetie.

01:00:50.496 --> 01:00:52.032
- It itches. It...
- I know, sweetie.

01:00:52.132 --> 01:00:54.868
- It's like there's something inside.
- I know. Just breathe. Just breathe.

01:00:54.968 --> 01:00:58.571
Stay still so I can clean this, okay?
Okay, sweetie.

01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:02.182
- Oh, Christ. It hurts. It...
- Take a deep breath.

01:01:04.143 --> 01:01:07.313
It feels like there's something
crawling in there.

01:01:07.413 --> 01:01:09.747
Is there something in there?

01:01:15.021 --> 01:01:17.557
Oh, what the hell is that?

01:01:17.657 --> 01:01:19.742
What is that?

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:54.927
Hey.

01:01:55.227 --> 01:01:56.729
You mind if I come in?

01:01:58.297 --> 01:01:59.163
Sure.

01:02:05.872 --> 01:02:07.805
I didn't know you had tattoos.

01:02:11.543 --> 01:02:15.379
- Did that hurt?
- I don't know.

01:02:22.722 --> 01:02:25.725
Do you remember anything?

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.293
What do you remember...

01:02:27.993 --> 01:02:30.188
about that night, Blake?

01:02:34.847 --> 01:02:36.066
Sara.

01:02:38.136 --> 01:02:40.440
I get flashes

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:41.742
in the chamber.

01:02:42.642 --> 01:02:47.164
It's... it's not like you guys.
I don't...

01:02:55.821 --> 01:02:57.688
When does your mom come to get you?

01:03:06.132 --> 01:03:07.898
I don't know.

01:03:09.302 --> 01:03:10.770
I don't care.

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:13.539
She seems a little overprotective.

01:03:13.938 --> 01:03:14.772
Yeah.

01:03:17.363 --> 01:03:19.478
That's one way to put it.

01:03:19.878 --> 01:03:24.081
- She cares, though.
- Can we please just not talk about her?

01:03:29.856 --> 01:03:32.371
S... I'm sorry.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.662
You know what would
have been really nice?

01:03:37.596 --> 01:03:40.895
Just if we could have
known each other before

01:03:41.195 --> 01:03:44.835
any of this... shit happened.

01:03:49.442 --> 01:03:51.876
I would have liked that.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.694
Corner lamp,

01:04:07.794 --> 01:04:11.686
patient room 2A.

01:04:17.827 --> 01:04:19.231
- Fuck!
- It's me, fuck-nut.

01:04:19.331 --> 01:04:23.409
Jesus Christ, Bauer. What are you doing?
Where'd you get that creepy-ass thing?

01:04:23.509 --> 01:04:25.411
It's cool, right?
I found it in the basement.

01:04:25.511 --> 01:04:27.847
No, it's goddamn weird.
Gives me the heebie-jeebies.

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:30.083
All right, all right.
Put your fucking vagina away.

01:04:30.183 --> 01:04:33.452
Fuck you! You scared
the shit out of me, boy!

01:04:33.722 --> 01:04:36.408
Goddamn jokester motherfucker.

01:04:39.025 --> 01:04:40.726
Aw, horseshit.

01:04:40.826 --> 01:04:42.534
Don't know how to do your job, old man?

01:04:42.634 --> 01:04:46.565
I do my job the same way I do
your mama, eight hours a day.

01:04:46.965 --> 01:04:50.068
Might have to switch me up
some circuits in here.

01:04:50.168 --> 01:04:52.238
Goddamn it.

01:04:52.338 --> 01:04:55.708
We're gonna need to be ready
for emergency lighting anyway.

01:04:55.808 --> 01:04:57.976
That storm's coming up strong.

01:04:58.606 --> 01:04:59.810
What the fuck?

01:05:04.282 --> 01:05:06.085
I'm glad you and...

01:05:06.385 --> 01:05:08.619
you and Sara are getting along.

01:05:09.689 --> 01:05:13.156
So... how are you feeling?

01:05:15.094 --> 01:05:16.929
Good. Thank you.

01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:19.466
Now, Blake,

01:05:19.566 --> 01:05:24.670
during your session in the chamber,
did you see anything strange?

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:28.007
Hear a voice other than mine

01:05:28.107 --> 01:05:30.463
trying to speak to you?

01:05:34.279 --> 01:05:36.080
May I?

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:46.056
The mask from the diner.
Is that what you saw?

01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:54.993
I understand how traumatic
that could be for you to remember, Blake.

01:05:55.093 --> 01:05:56.901
It's scary.

01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:00.539
Blake.

01:06:01.139 --> 01:06:03.908
It's... it's a scary mask.

01:06:05.677 --> 01:06:08.681
Blake... it's just a mask.

01:06:09.081 --> 01:06:12.551
All of us wear masks every day.

01:06:13.351 --> 01:06:15.988
We hide behind social masks.

01:06:16.088 --> 01:06:19.025
We need to wear them.
We couldn't survive without them.

01:06:19.725 --> 01:06:23.930
What frightens you isn't this mask.

01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:27.206
What scares you is what it represents.

01:06:38.644 --> 01:06:44.373
Blake, I need to ask you something
that may make you feel uncomfortable,

01:06:44.883 --> 01:06:46.116
might upset you.

01:06:49.822 --> 01:06:51.688
Go ahead.

01:06:53.993 --> 01:06:57.389
I need to know exactly

01:06:57.489 --> 01:07:00.431
where you were sitting in that diner.

01:07:02.734 --> 01:07:03.755
I don't know.

01:07:05.637 --> 01:07:09.108
All right. What were you wearing?

01:07:09.908 --> 01:07:11.041
You remember that?

01:07:13.979 --> 01:07:16.482
- Talk to me. What did you have to eat?
- I don't know.

01:07:16.582 --> 01:07:20.134
French fries? How did you get there, Blake?
Who did you come with?

01:07:20.234 --> 01:07:23.389
All right. What was your meal that day?
What were you wearing?

01:07:23.489 --> 01:07:25.691
- I don't know.
- Blake, you can do this.

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:29.229
- Talk to me, Blake!
- You look at me,

01:07:30.329 --> 01:07:33.199
and you don't know anything.

01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:36.166
Doc. You gotta come with me.

01:07:38.837 --> 01:07:41.438
- Were you even there that day?
- Doc.

01:07:44.943 --> 01:07:47.747
The basement. It's the bug chick.

01:07:47.847 --> 01:07:50.014
It appears Blake's
developed necrophobia.

01:07:56.055 --> 01:07:58.391
I think it's a good idea for me
to go prep her room,

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:00.809
prepare for a worst-case scenario.

01:08:01.509 --> 01:08:04.897
I'm not even sure I know what
a worst-case scenario is around here.

01:08:04.997 --> 01:08:07.099
I know, but I don't know
what else to do.

01:08:07.399 --> 01:08:10.402
She will claw herself apart.

01:08:10.502 --> 01:08:14.807
At least in here,
we have a chance to reach her.

01:08:14.907 --> 01:08:16.073
You can reach her.

01:08:24.283 --> 01:08:26.850
Or something else may reach her.

01:08:36.828 --> 01:08:40.111
Sweetheart, I'm gonna need you
to close your eyes.

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:44.768
Megan. Megan.

01:08:45.738 --> 01:08:47.104
Megan.

01:08:48.341 --> 01:08:49.337
Megan.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.443
No!

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:08.207
<i>A masked gunman has opened fire
inside a popular restaurant tonight,</i>

01:12:08.307 --> 01:12:11.243
<i>killing six people,
including a seven-year-old boy.</i>

01:12:11.543 --> 01:12:14.713
<i>Police are still looking for the suspect,
who is said to be wearing a mask</i>

01:12:14.813 --> 01:12:16.980
<i>and is heavily armed.</i>

01:12:39.638 --> 01:12:41.640
Get the hell on,
you annoying son of a bitch.

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:43.675
Hey, you know
what's going on with the lights?

01:12:43.875 --> 01:12:46.078
Obviously, there is a power surge.

01:12:46.178 --> 01:12:49.022
Dr. O thinks my time is better off
spent putting beds together

01:12:49.222 --> 01:12:50.836
for goddamn crazy people.

01:12:50.936 --> 01:12:53.919
By the way, your friend's down
in the chamber. She freaked out.

01:12:54.019 --> 01:12:57.256
- Who? Megan?
- That's the one.

01:12:57.956 --> 01:13:00.058
Can you take me to her, please?

01:13:00.158 --> 01:13:02.561
You know what? I am goddamn tired
of being a chambermaid.

01:13:02.661 --> 01:13:06.231
I need to reroute power to the emergency
lights anyway. Come on. I'll take you there.

01:13:06.331 --> 01:13:08.167
Shit.

01:13:09.067 --> 01:13:12.533
Megan. Megan.
Megan, talk to me. Open it!

01:13:12.633 --> 01:13:14.155
- I'll see what I can do.
- Can't you open it?

01:13:14.255 --> 01:13:20.244
Megan. Hey. Hey, Megan. Talk to me.
Look at me. Look at me. Hey.

01:13:29.088 --> 01:13:31.721
Bauer, get your ass down
to the chamber now!

01:13:34.993 --> 01:13:36.249
Let's get her out of there.

01:13:37.929 --> 01:13:41.200
Get her head down there.
What the hell is wrong with her?

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.162
Listen, I can't find Andover anywhere.
He is fucking gone.

01:13:44.262 --> 01:13:47.172
- Oh, Jesus.
- What's wrong with her eyes?

01:13:48.172 --> 01:13:51.276
- God, she doesn't even blink. That's trippy.
- Don't touch her.

01:13:51.576 --> 01:13:54.346
I saw the same thing with Paige.
Her heart rate and blood pressure

01:13:54.446 --> 01:13:58.150
are impossibly low.
By all accounts, she should be dead.

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:00.252
Sweetie, come on. It's okay.

01:14:00.652 --> 01:14:02.921
Don't close her eyes,

01:14:03.821 --> 01:14:04.990
even for a minute.

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:08.861
You guys, she needs real medical attention,
more than I can give her here.

01:14:08.961 --> 01:14:12.531
Under normal circumstances, I can cover
RN duties, but nothing is normal here.

01:14:13.431 --> 01:14:16.134
We need to get her to a hospital
before her body goes into shock.

01:14:16.234 --> 01:14:19.704
- I can carry her out.
- No. Someone's got to go to the hospital.

01:14:19.804 --> 01:14:21.473
That ain't gonna happen, all right?

01:14:21.573 --> 01:14:25.511
All the doors and windows are jammed tight
with this tar shit. It's impossible.

01:14:25.611 --> 01:14:28.046
Yeah? Well, hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

01:14:28.888 --> 01:14:31.817
- I still don't have a damn signal.
- I ain't got one either upstairs.

01:14:32.217 --> 01:14:35.087
Whether it's that storm or this shit,
I don't know, but here's what I'm thinking.

01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:37.956
- We're fucked.
- Okay, I need more medical supplies.

01:14:38.056 --> 01:14:40.846
When this sedative wears off,
if she even comes out of this,

01:14:40.946 --> 01:14:43.028
we need extra blankets
to raise her body temperature,

01:14:43.128 --> 01:14:46.131
- and there's not enough down here.
- I'm gonna go get supplies, all right?

01:14:46.231 --> 01:14:47.599
- No. No, no, no.
- I'll be back in a minute.

01:14:47.699 --> 01:14:51.236
Honey, wait a minute. None of us know what
the hell's going on around here, all right?

01:14:51.336 --> 01:14:53.205
Everything's gone up shit creek.
I don't think you should be

01:14:53.305 --> 01:14:56.473
- running around there all by yourself.
- I'll take my chances.

01:15:00.312 --> 01:15:03.180
Goddamn, that is creepy.

01:15:30.008 --> 01:15:31.644
Paige.

01:15:32.044 --> 01:15:35.111
Please, help me.

01:15:52.764 --> 01:15:54.886
I know who you are.

01:16:00.304 --> 01:16:01.698
I won't let you through again.

01:16:04.509 --> 01:16:06.898
The door is closed.

01:16:08.514 --> 01:16:12.583
You were taking so much food
off my table.

01:16:46.418 --> 01:16:48.251
I'm going back.

01:16:49.955 --> 01:16:52.423
You're home now.

01:17:06.571 --> 01:17:09.788
<i>Her body temperature and vitals
say she... she should have expired,</i>

01:17:09.888 --> 01:17:12.578
<i>but she's beyond my reach.</i>

01:17:12.678 --> 01:17:16.482
<i>It's as if something else is holding on
to her, not letting her die,</i>

01:17:16.582 --> 01:17:21.286
<i>keeping her in a state worse than death,
a kind of fear loop.</i>

01:17:23.689 --> 01:17:29.661
<i>I stupidly tried to eradicate a fundamental
and necessary human function,</i>

01:17:29.761 --> 01:17:31.463
<i>the oldest human emotion.</i>

01:17:31.963 --> 01:17:34.032
<i>And now fear itself,</i>

01:17:34.132 --> 01:17:38.268
<i>now it wants to live
and breathe on its own.</i>

01:17:39.971 --> 01:17:44.476
<i>I think... I think an entity
is coming through into our world,</i>

01:17:44.576 --> 01:17:49.614
<i>and now fear itself,
perhaps planning to use all of us</i>

01:17:49.714 --> 01:17:52.315
<i>as a host, a vessel.</i>

01:18:01.259 --> 01:18:04.262
'Bout time you get down here.
Can you give me a hand?

01:18:04.662 --> 01:18:06.635
Lazy fucker.

01:18:09.468 --> 01:18:14.273
Come on. Quit looking for your girlie
magazines and get over here. Help me out.

01:18:14.973 --> 01:18:17.486
Thing ain't gonna jury-rig itself.

01:18:18.676 --> 01:18:19.542
Fuck.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.948
What the fuck is this?

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:35.859
What in the fuck?

01:18:53.611 --> 01:18:56.782
Look, I know the sounds of gunshots.
We need to get the hell out of here.

01:18:57.182 --> 01:18:58.915
And how are you gonna do that?

01:19:00.052 --> 01:19:01.805
I'm gonna find a way.

01:19:06.024 --> 01:19:08.511
Fuck! Fuck!

01:19:33.084 --> 01:19:36.188
What's going on? Did you find him?

01:19:36.888 --> 01:19:39.191
Bauer, can you please
go find Andover for me?

01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:41.159
- Yeah. I mean, it wants me.
- Please?

01:19:41.259 --> 01:19:42.794
It needs me to... it wants me to join.

01:19:42.894 --> 01:19:44.162
- Bauer.
- I'm not in.

01:19:44.262 --> 01:19:46.632
- Bauer.
- I don't want...

01:19:46.732 --> 01:19:49.100
- Bauer.
- I don't want to be in.

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:52.070
- What is going on with you? Bauer?
- This is the door.

01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:53.737
Bauer? Bauer!

01:19:57.175 --> 01:20:01.547
You really think he's gonna
let me leave here, don't you?

01:20:02.247 --> 01:20:04.048
"He"? Who the hell
are you talking about, babe?

01:20:04.148 --> 01:20:05.684
He's coming.

01:20:05.784 --> 01:20:10.555
Bauer, can you please
go get Dr. Andover for me?

01:20:11.355 --> 01:20:13.558
What... what is going on with you?

01:20:14.915 --> 01:20:16.286
Bauer!

01:20:17.295 --> 01:20:18.797
Bauer?

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:22.134
- You still don't get it, do you?
- Oh, no, no, no. You don't...

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:24.035
- He's coming.
- No, no.

01:20:24.135 --> 01:20:26.536
- That's how you leave!
- Bauer?

01:20:28.039 --> 01:20:30.776
- Hear him, baby?
- No, listen to me. You're talking crazy.

01:20:30.876 --> 01:20:33.511
The window. I pushed on the...
It pushed back!

01:20:33.611 --> 01:20:35.513
- Look at me.
- It's not letting me leave.

01:20:36.394 --> 01:20:38.917
- No! No! No! No!
- Bauer, it's okay. It's okay.

01:20:39.017 --> 01:20:42.986
- It'll all be over soon.
- No, I got an idea. I have this.

01:20:46.157 --> 01:20:47.192
Caylee!

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:50.960
Bauer!

01:21:00.806 --> 01:21:05.277
You promised me.
You promised me I could be with him.

01:21:05.377 --> 01:21:09.679
You promised me you'd get me
out of here. Go away!

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:13.585
I keep my promises.

01:21:13.685 --> 01:21:15.618
You want to see Kevin?

01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:21.726
<i>Worse than death, a kind of fear loop.</i>

01:21:48.887 --> 01:21:54.392
<i>My hundreds of sessions curing the phobic
are starving this thing somehow.</i>

01:21:54.492 --> 01:21:57.595
<i>It's relentless and,
worst of all, patient.</i>

01:21:57.695 --> 01:22:02.231
<i>It needs to feed,
and it won't be denied its meals.</i>

01:22:17.782 --> 01:22:19.648
Dr. Andover?

01:22:20.919 --> 01:22:23.452
Have a little faith.

01:22:25.257 --> 01:22:27.893
Is that... is that you?

01:22:28.293 --> 01:22:31.230
Have a little faith.

01:22:32.664 --> 01:22:34.666
Are you okay?

01:22:35.567 --> 01:22:40.169
Everything's going to be okay.

01:22:51.115 --> 01:22:52.884
Worse than death,

01:22:53.684 --> 01:22:57.320
the kind of fear loop.

01:23:39.297 --> 01:23:41.230
Andover?

01:23:47.572 --> 01:23:49.405
Andover!

01:24:06.024 --> 01:24:07.290
Please.

01:24:15.533 --> 01:24:16.969
No! God!

01:25:04.983 --> 01:25:06.785
Sara,

01:25:07.485 --> 01:25:09.454
you were right about one thing.

01:25:09.554 --> 01:25:14.023
Sometimes it's smart to be
scared of the dark.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:16.726
No!

01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:28.540
Blake.

01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:33.111
Blake, it's not you.
Blake, this isn't you.

01:25:33.911 --> 01:25:37.348
Then tell me, Sara,
why does this mask feel so familiar?

01:25:37.648 --> 01:25:40.085
You're not wearing a mask.

01:25:40.185 --> 01:25:41.686
Look.

01:25:41.886 --> 01:25:43.953
Feel your face.

01:25:58.836 --> 01:26:00.906
You killed all those people!

01:26:01.006 --> 01:26:02.693
You should be dead!

01:26:08.846 --> 01:26:10.872
I do remember you.

01:26:22.031 --> 01:26:23.995
It was me.

01:26:24.563 --> 01:26:26.231
It was me.

01:26:26.331 --> 01:26:29.265
I did it. I'm so sorry.

01:26:40.478 --> 01:26:41.777
Blake, we have to go.

01:27:01.599 --> 01:27:03.165
Don't. No.

01:27:08.773 --> 01:27:10.041
How did it end?

01:27:10.141 --> 01:27:13.943
I simply closed her eyes.

01:27:33.264 --> 01:27:34.597
Fuck!

01:28:07.332 --> 01:28:08.631
Dylan.

01:28:13.938 --> 01:28:16.272
You want to see Kevin?

01:28:55.079 --> 01:28:58.014
Stop! Get off me!

01:29:01.151 --> 01:29:02.852
There's nothing left to fear.

01:29:52.403 --> 01:29:54.472
It's just us.

01:29:54.572 --> 01:29:56.457
I know.

01:29:57.608 --> 01:30:00.278
But it'll be back,

01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:03.147
and it'll be stronger.

01:30:03.347 --> 01:30:05.914
Fear never dies.

01:30:08.553 --> 01:30:11.289
It wanted you all along.

01:30:11.389 --> 01:30:12.888
Was my fault.

01:30:14.859 --> 01:30:17.693
I opened the door.

01:30:23.334 --> 01:30:25.868
Then let's change the locks.

01:30:28.072 --> 01:30:30.973
Maybe it's time
for one more session, Doctor.

01:30:32.577 --> 01:30:37.148
<i>Fear, it is relentless.</i>

01:30:37.248 --> 01:30:39.017
<i>It needs to feed,</i>

01:30:39.117 --> 01:30:42.420
<i>and it won't be denied its meals.</i>

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.524
<i>After seeing what it did to get to me,</i>

01:30:46.624 --> 01:30:50.528
<i>my concern is that fear itself</i>

01:30:51.028 --> 01:30:54.532
<i>will use me, my clinic,</i>

01:30:54.632 --> 01:30:57.467
<i>and the chamber to feed, to...</i>

01:30:58.166 --> 01:31:00.002
<i>to consume...</i>

01:31:01.705 --> 01:31:03.639
<i>all of us.</i>

01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:08.217
Now close your eyes.

01:31:08.317 --> 01:31:12.493
Concentrate on the sound of my voice.

01:32:09.373 --> 01:32:11.876
<i>It's way past midnight
There's a howling wind</i>

01:32:11.976 --> 01:32:14.345
<i>Oh, God, what can it be?</i>

01:32:14.445 --> 01:32:18.783
<i>Something out there evil
Is coming straight for me</i>

01:32:18.883 --> 01:32:23.287
<i>The house is dark and very cold
I know there's no one here</i>

01:32:23.387 --> 01:32:27.592
<i>Why am I scared to death?
Just petrified with fear</i>

01:32:27.692 --> 01:32:30.128
<i>'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking</i>

01:32:30.228 --> 01:32:32.130
<i>Waiting for me in the house</i>

01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:34.666
<i>'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking</i>

01:32:34.766 --> 01:32:38.877
<i>Waiting for me in the dark
The dark</i>

01:32:54.885 --> 01:32:57.188
<i>When I opened up the door
and snapped on the switch</i>

01:32:57.288 --> 01:32:59.424
<i>The room was filled with light</i>

01:32:59.524 --> 01:33:03.861
<i>Then something black and very fast
Flit upon my sight</i>

01:33:03.961 --> 01:33:08.666
<i>What I feared most as a child
Was the coming of the night</i>

01:33:08.766 --> 01:33:12.937
<i>Now my horrors have become quite real
My nightmares breathe new life</i>

01:33:13.037 --> 01:33:15.406
<i>'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking</i>

01:33:15.506 --> 01:33:17.442
<i>Waiting for me in the house</i>

01:33:17.542 --> 01:33:19.877
<i>'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking</i>

01:33:19.977 --> 01:33:22.544
<i>Waiting for me in the dark</i>

01:33:23.648 --> 01:33:25.382
<i>Dark</i>

01:33:31.923 --> 01:33:33.355
<i>Yeah</i>

01:34:24.542 --> 01:34:28.813
<i>What is it in the house
That the darkness brings to life?</i>

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:33.518
<i>I sense their eyes upon me
As I grab a butcher knife</i>

01:34:33.618 --> 01:34:37.955
<i>Whatever it is that waits for me
It hides beneath my bed</i>

01:34:38.055 --> 01:34:42.393
<i>And if I try to sleep tonight
By morning, I'll be dead</i>

01:34:42.493 --> 01:34:44.862
<i>'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking</i>

01:34:44.962 --> 01:34:46.831
<i>Waiting for me in the house</i>

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:49.267
<i>'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking</i>

01:34:49.367 --> 01:34:51.402
<i>Waiting for me in the dark</i>

01:34:51.502 --> 01:34:53.871
<i>'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking</i>

01:34:53.971 --> 01:34:55.973
<i>Waiting for me in the house</i>

01:34:56.073 --> 01:34:58.442
<i>'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking</i>

01:34:58.542 --> 01:35:01.944
<i>Waiting for me in the dark</i>

01:35:03.481 --> 01:35:05.616
<i>Yeah</i>

01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:15.292
<i>Yeah, 'cause I'm shaking,
and I'm thinking</i>

01:35:15.392 --> 01:35:18.496
<i>Of something evil lurking
Waiting for me in the house</i>

01:35:18.596 --> 01:35:21.032
<i>'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking</i>

01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:23.201
<i>Waiting for me in the dark</i>

01:35:23.301 --> 01:35:25.567
Fear never dies.
