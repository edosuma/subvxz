<i>Previously on Private Eyes.</i>

00:02.041 --> 00:04.178
I took over the agency last
year so technically you got

00:04.203 --> 00:07.733
the boss. After my dad died,
Maz used to give me cases.

00:07.758 --> 00:10.828
We agreed that the custody arrangement
would resume when I got back.

00:10.853 --> 00:12.871
Now, I can't go back
to being a weekend dad.

00:12.896 --> 00:15.127
- It's OK, Dad, I get it.
- Will you take this key

00:15.152 --> 00:17.447
to be my full-on P.I. agency partner?

00:17.472 --> 00:20.299
I will.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.923
- Whoa!
- He asked Angie

00:22.956 --> 00:24.923
to go to St. Lucia. She said yes.

00:24.948 --> 00:27.072
St. Lucia? Nice.

01:03.103 --> 01:05.147
Keep the change.

01:16.165 --> 01:19.101
ARGH! UGH!

01:19.928 --> 01:23.820
- Shade?!
- Angie? You're home early!

01:23.845 --> 01:27.766
Give me back my 500 bucks!

01:28.385 --> 01:31.483
Say cheese! So much
easier to prove assault

01:31.508 --> 01:33.047
when you have video evidence.

01:33.072 --> 01:35.195
Now judging by those prison tags,

01:35.220 --> 01:37.648
I'm gonna guess you're out on parole,
which means

01:37.673 --> 01:40.693
this misunderstanding could be costly.

01:41.030 --> 01:44.380
300 bucks. What say we call it even?

01:48.904 --> 01:51.696
You're lucky she showed up.

01:51.721 --> 01:55.199
It's what partners are for!
Tell your friends about us!

01:55.419 --> 01:56.990
Do I even wanna know?

01:57.015 --> 01:58.833
Ah, he's just upset
'cause I took pictures

01:58.858 --> 02:00.958
of his wife with the pool boy,

02:00.983 --> 02:03.736
and the plumber, and the furnace guy.

02:03.761 --> 02:06.395
Ha! Ha! She kept a
well-maintained house.

02:06.569 --> 02:09.473
How much did this particular
transaction cost us?

02:09.499 --> 02:11.146
- Not including the window?
- Oh!

02:11.171 --> 02:14.106
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. Haha! Uh,

02:14.131 --> 02:16.247
what are you doing here?
You and Nolan aren't supposed to be back

02:16.272 --> 02:19.092
- for a week.
- We changed our flight.

02:19.117 --> 02:21.618
You know what? Your timing is perfect.
I just got a call

02:21.643 --> 02:23.927
about a case.
Old friend of mine, Emilia Mantella.

02:24.197 --> 02:25.889
Shouldn't we clean this up first?

02:25.914 --> 02:28.357
I have a great glass guy;
we'll call him from the car.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.568
What are you hiding?

02:29.593 --> 02:31.626
Nothing!

02:36.888 --> 02:38.822
It's not as bad as it looks.

02:38.847 --> 02:40.806
Looks like the running of the bulls.

02:40.831 --> 02:44.449
Uh, well, I was going to clean it up,
but you came home early.

02:44.474 --> 02:46.197
Why did you change
your flight by the way?

02:46.222 --> 02:48.097
I leave you alone for
two weeks, and this is

02:48.122 --> 02:50.616
- what happens.
- It wasn't quite two weeks;

02:50.648 --> 02:53.660
- you did come back early.
- Nolan got sick, OK?

02:53.685 --> 02:55.760
He didn't die, did he?
Is that why you're home?

02:55.785 --> 02:58.050
Of course he didn't die.
We had a great time.

02:58.075 --> 03:00.339
That's more like it.
Alright, lay it on me: you,

03:00.364 --> 03:03.747
Nolan, a red bikini...
I'm sure you were wearing something too.

03:03.772 --> 03:05.638
What?

03:09.769 --> 03:11.586
What the hell is that?

03:11.611 --> 03:14.196
- You like it? Got a good deal.
- Where's the old couch?

03:14.227 --> 03:15.847
Is this why you didn't
want me to come inside?

03:15.872 --> 03:17.738
I thought I'd spruce the place

03:17.763 --> 03:19.738
up a little,
add a couple of personal touches.

03:19.763 --> 03:22.053
It's an office, Shade,
not your personal man cave.

03:22.078 --> 03:24.188
- Put the old couch back.
- I can't.

03:24.213 --> 03:25.941
It's not here.

03:26.012 --> 03:27.845
Please tell me that you didn't sell it.

03:27.870 --> 03:30.304
No! I didn't sell it! Ha!

03:30.360 --> 03:32.144
I left it on the curb.

03:32.169 --> 03:35.070
- You threw away my dad's couch?
- I didn't throw it away.

03:35.095 --> 03:38.199
- I donated it.
- To the street!

03:38.224 --> 03:39.964
Look, just...

03:40.557 --> 03:43.050
try it out. It's really comfortable.

03:43.075 --> 03:45.089
I'm gonna go tape up that window.

03:45.113 --> 03:46.589
You're gonna sit on it sooner or later.

03:46.614 --> 03:49.277
I'd like to tell you
what to sit on right now.

03:50.635 --> 03:52.496
And she's back.

03:52.814 --> 03:56.737
Welcome to Mantella's
Motorsport racetrack!

04:01.655 --> 04:03.940
So this client of ours,

04:03.965 --> 04:06.929
- how exactly do you know her?
- Emilia and I go way back.

04:06.954 --> 04:09.155
She owns Mantella Autosport,
one of the smaller teams

04:09.180 --> 04:10.827
in the Pirelli World Challenge.

04:10.852 --> 04:12.852
There's a big race this weekend,
last one of the season.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.411
Thanks, I watch the news.

04:14.436 --> 04:15.872
Emilia is one of the most driven people

04:15.897 --> 04:17.781
I know, but she's also a sweetheart.

04:17.805 --> 04:19.773
Actually let me behind the
wheel a couple of times.

04:19.798 --> 04:21.218
Is that what they called it back then?

04:21.243 --> 04:23.834
Hahaha! Only home an
hour and already asking

04:23.859 --> 04:26.760
- about my romantic conquests.
- Matt Shade?!

04:27.601 --> 04:30.257
Hinch! Hehe!

04:30.282 --> 04:33.440
Hey, Angie,
this is my good buddy James Hinchcliffe.

04:33.465 --> 04:36.335
World famous Indy-car driver
and demon on the dance floor.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.383
All true,

04:37.408 --> 04:39.499
except the good buddy part.
What are you doing here?

04:39.524 --> 04:42.074
Hahaha! Just working on a case.

04:42.099 --> 04:43.930
Hey, did you ever

04:43.954 --> 04:46.296
- hear anything about...
- Albuquerque?

04:46.321 --> 04:48.780
- No, man, I think we're good.
- Can you tell that

04:48.805 --> 04:50.773
to Doug Gilmour?
Guy won't stop calling me about it.

04:50.798 --> 04:52.531
I'll see what I can do.

04:54.924 --> 04:56.977
That's a long story.

04:57.002 --> 04:58.299
Alright, I'll tell ya.

04:58.323 --> 05:00.492
So we were at this charity
event in Albuquerque...

05:00.517 --> 05:03.017
- Nobody in now, OK? No one!
- Emilia!

05:03.042 --> 05:06.400
You see anyone come... Shadow.

05:07.443 --> 05:08.699
Thank you for coming.

05:08.724 --> 05:11.273
Yeah. Angie, Emilia. So what happened?

05:11.298 --> 05:14.108
Follow me. I got a call this morning

05:14.133 --> 05:16.202
from my crew chief. The door had been

05:16.227 --> 05:18.427
jimmied open.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.652
And inside, he found this.

05:22.593 --> 05:25.897
_

05:27.118 --> 05:30.748
- What is it?
- I think it's blood.

06:05.369 --> 06:09.470
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:12.345 --> 06:14.779
You need to call the police.
They have way more resources

06:14.804 --> 06:17.056
- for this kind of thing.
- No, you don't understand.

06:17.081 --> 06:20.033
My team is already shaken up;
if the press catches wind of this,

06:20.058 --> 06:22.397
it's gonna kill my chances
at the race on Saturday.

06:22.422 --> 06:24.236
If you don't figure out who wrote this,
you might

06:24.261 --> 06:26.594
- kill more than your chances.
- Everything I have

06:26.619 --> 06:28.782
is riding on that race.
If we do well on Saturday,

06:28.807 --> 06:31.455
we have a shot at a
top-10 finish overall.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.118
It's a guaranteed bonus,
not to mention the sponsorships

06:34.143 --> 06:35.954
that flow from that.
It's enough to secure

06:35.979 --> 06:38.353
the team's future for
a long time, Shade.

06:38.378 --> 06:41.443
- Give us a minute?
- Yeah.

06:42.439 --> 06:44.118
We should let the cops handle this.

06:44.143 --> 06:46.390
- That's a lot of blood.
- We don't know that's human

06:46.415 --> 06:49.695
- blood. Could be animal blood.
- And that's better because...?

06:49.720 --> 06:51.142
Emilia's been a friend

06:51.167 --> 06:53.434
for a long time,
I don't want to let her down.

06:54.015 --> 06:56.917
OK. Fine, we'll look into it.

06:56.942 --> 06:59.043
- Just like that?
- Someone needs to pay

06:59.068 --> 07:00.921
for that new window.

07:01.366 --> 07:04.007
Get a swab of the blood;
we'll take it to Maz.

07:04.032 --> 07:06.463
- Mom?
- Eric, just...

07:06.659 --> 07:09.869
- wait.
- Holy hell!

07:09.909 --> 07:12.025
Yeah, I know.
I was hoping you wouldn't see this.

07:12.050 --> 07:13.517
Who are these people?

07:13.542 --> 07:16.197
Eric, this is my friend, Shade,

07:16.222 --> 07:19.541
and his partner, Angie.
This is my son, Eric, our driver.

07:19.566 --> 07:23.435
- We're gonna look into this for you.
- Why? Obvious Ronny did it.

07:23.460 --> 07:25.427
- Who's Ronny?
- Ronny Caine.

07:25.452 --> 07:27.322
He owns another racing team.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.414
We're ahead of him in points,
but I don't think he'd do

07:29.439 --> 07:31.244
- something like this.
- Are you kidding?

07:31.269 --> 07:32.994
Ronny hates me.

07:33.861 --> 07:37.207
I'm half his age and twice
the racer he will ever be.

07:37.232 --> 07:39.376
If anybody would do this, it's him.

07:40.850 --> 07:44.032
Is that what he said?

07:44.243 --> 07:47.408
- Figures. Kid's a punk.
- So you're not

07:47.433 --> 07:49.436
- behind them in the standings.
- Of course I am.

07:49.461 --> 07:51.394
- So is half the field.
- But you're

07:51.419 --> 07:53.322
the only one with the real
shot of knocking them out

07:53.347 --> 07:55.322
- of the top ten.
- That's all Emilia cares about,

07:55.347 --> 07:57.747
isn't it? I guess if I
were in her position,

07:57.772 --> 07:59.962
- I'd feel the same way.
- What position is that?

07:59.987 --> 08:03.146
She's broke. Needs that bonus
'cause she's bleeding money.

08:03.171 --> 08:05.279
Still not hearing how that clears you.

08:05.304 --> 08:08.252
How about this? I want
them in that race.

08:08.277 --> 08:10.829
That kid treats the track like
his own personal video game.

08:10.854 --> 08:12.743
I wanna see his face
when he's eating my dust

08:12.768 --> 08:15.517
- at the checkered flag.
- Where were you last night?

08:15.542 --> 08:17.942
I was in my hotel room.

08:18.177 --> 08:20.177
Feel free to check with the manager.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.619
OK, the manager confirmed
Ronny was in by 9,

08:27.644 --> 08:29.869
and two X-rated movies
on his bill tell the rest

08:29.893 --> 08:31.244
- of the story.
- Let me guess.

08:31.269 --> 08:34.681
The Fast and the Furriest?
No! Lays of Thunder?

08:34.706 --> 08:37.446
- Don't.
- He could have hired somebody.

08:37.471 --> 08:40.861
Maybe. But I believe him when he
says he wants to see Eric lose.

08:40.885 --> 08:43.018
- He seems arrogant enough.
- Dude, it's called

08:43.043 --> 08:44.603
being competitive.
It's what athletes do.

08:44.628 --> 08:48.329
I'm not sure that driving in a
circle qualifies as athleticism.

08:48.354 --> 08:50.487
Do you have any idea
how much skill it takes

08:50.512 --> 08:53.306
to drive 200 miles an hour
in a crowded field of cars?

08:53.331 --> 08:55.999
Exactly. "Skills." Like... juggling.

08:56.024 --> 08:58.658
Strength. Endurance. Reflexes.

08:58.683 --> 09:00.883
When was the last time you took
your life in your own hands?

09:01.086 --> 09:03.086
Every time I get in the car with you.

09:03.111 --> 09:04.634
Very funny.

09:04.659 --> 09:06.611
We should get this blood tested.
Let's go see Mazhari.

09:06.643 --> 09:11.001
- Ooh! Done in 60 seconds!
- Oh, my God!

09:13.340 --> 09:15.275
Ho! Ho! There she is!

09:15.300 --> 09:17.652
The queen of calypso,
the rani of reggae,

09:17.677 --> 09:19.431
the czarina of soca.

09:19.974 --> 09:21.806
A little birdie told me you were back.

09:21.831 --> 09:22.510
Is he in?

09:22.535 --> 09:25.321
No. They found a dead body
strapped to a paddleboard

09:25.345 --> 09:27.478
in the Don River.
He won't be back for hours.

09:27.559 --> 09:29.275
I need a favour.

09:29.300 --> 09:30.674
That's gotta be a new world record.

09:30.699 --> 09:33.354
What, you've been back in
the country four hours?

09:33.378 --> 09:35.912
We think it's blood.
I need a full DNA work-up.

09:35.937 --> 09:38.838
Nobody dead yet, as far as we know.

09:39.169 --> 09:40.541
OK. But there better be

09:40.566 --> 09:43.100
some free-flowing Caribbean
rum the next time I pop by.

09:43.451 --> 09:45.416
Hey, also, you can sign this.

09:45.441 --> 09:47.392
Cops are hosting a charity 10K.
I need people to

09:47.417 --> 09:50.298
sponsor me.

09:50.593 --> 09:53.494
What's the matter, Shade?
You forget how to spell your name?

09:53.519 --> 09:55.306
Sponsorship, that's it.

09:55.331 --> 09:56.900
- What are you talking about?
- The real fuel

09:56.925 --> 09:59.576
in the racing world is money:
to pay for salaries, equipment,

09:59.601 --> 10:01.760
travel, not to mention the
cost of the car itself.

10:01.785 --> 10:03.718
You think Emilia got on
the wrong side of one

10:03.743 --> 10:05.843
- of her corporate sponsors?
- Hey, who's Emilia?

10:05.868 --> 10:08.368
You guys know I'm still
in the room, right?

10:11.048 --> 10:13.743
You didn't even sign it!

10:22.091 --> 10:24.085
You gotta be kidding me.

10:24.110 --> 10:26.413
Emilia said Friar Cluck's was
one of her biggest sponsors

10:26.438 --> 10:28.241
until she dumped them a month ago.

10:28.266 --> 10:29.811
Why dump them if she's short of money?

10:29.836 --> 10:33.069
She landed a bigger fish, literally.
Barnacle Ben's,

10:33.095 --> 10:36.329
600 restaurants across North America,
3 billion in sales.

10:36.354 --> 10:38.555
Let me guess:
Friar Cluck's didn't take it very well.

10:38.580 --> 10:40.880
Emilia said the CEO, Georgina Wilkes,

10:40.905 --> 10:42.491
threatened to deep fry her.

10:42.516 --> 10:45.937
Mr. and Mrs. Shade, welcome.

10:45.962 --> 10:48.195
Thank you for making the time for us,
Ms. Wilkes.

10:48.220 --> 10:50.124
Call me Georgina.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.516
Mr. Shade, I was a big fan of yours.

10:52.541 --> 10:55.319
It warms my heart that
you are interested

10:55.344 --> 10:57.871
in a business franchise
with my humble company.

10:57.896 --> 11:00.030
I figured we eat at your
restaurant often enough,

11:00.055 --> 11:02.555
why not buy one?

11:02.695 --> 11:05.373
- Ain't that right, Peaches?
- It surely is!

11:05.423 --> 11:07.723
Well, it's a fairly simple agreement.

11:07.748 --> 11:09.748
I can go over the details with you.

11:09.773 --> 11:12.974
Actually,
we had a couple of questions first.

11:12.999 --> 11:14.430
We heard that Friar Cluck's

11:14.455 --> 11:17.093
is no longer sponsoring
the Mantella racing team.

11:17.258 --> 11:19.137
That's not public knowledge.

11:19.162 --> 11:22.630
My wife is a stickler for due diligence.

11:22.655 --> 11:26.086
- And she's a big race fan.
- Well, it's true.

11:26.111 --> 11:28.742
After 12 years, Mantella Autosport

11:28.767 --> 11:31.586
decided to terminate our
business relationship.

11:31.611 --> 11:33.859
We heard you two had
quite a screaming match.

11:33.884 --> 11:35.274
What's that got to do with anything?

11:35.299 --> 11:36.117
Someone wrote a death threat

11:36.142 --> 11:37.976
on Emilia Mantella's wall last night.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.700
- Wait, who are you?
- Private investigators

11:40.725 --> 11:44.204
hired by Emilia. Where
were you last night?

11:47.680 --> 11:50.062
According to Georgina,
she was home alone from 8 p.m.

11:50.087 --> 11:53.528
to 7 a.m. That's more than enough
time to get to the track and back.

11:53.553 --> 11:55.758
- You think she did it?
- She really got her giblets

11:55.783 --> 11:58.383
- in a knot over getting dumped.
- Hmm, she seemed pretty shocked

11:58.408 --> 12:00.922
when we told her about the death threat.

12:02.617 --> 12:04.852
Oh right, the window.

12:04.877 --> 12:07.277
- Uh, I'll come in and clean up...
- Tomorrow.

12:07.302 --> 12:09.383
You've been spending too much time here.

12:12.508 --> 12:15.670
- You miss Jules.
- It's not the same

12:15.695 --> 12:18.030
- at home without her.
- Can't you talk to Becca

12:18.055 --> 12:20.199
and see if she can switch
custody back to 50/50?

12:20.224 --> 12:23.390
You've met Becca, right?
Once she makes her mind up

12:23.415 --> 12:25.581
about something, there's no changing it.

12:25.729 --> 12:28.535
That doesn't mean you should
spend all your time here,

12:28.560 --> 12:30.893
redecorating.

12:32.079 --> 12:35.748
Hey, wanna have dinner? I still
haven't seen your conga-line photos.

12:35.773 --> 12:38.633
Goodnight, Shade.

12:48.295 --> 12:50.229
- He whispered to you or...?
- I don't know.

12:50.254 --> 12:52.395
Hey, Matt, look who
dropped by for a visit!

12:52.420 --> 12:54.420
- Hi!
- Hey, baby girl!

12:54.422 --> 12:56.052
What are you doing here?

12:56.077 --> 12:58.501
Uh, Mom was working late,
so I came by after school.

12:58.526 --> 13:00.513
Why didn't you call me?
I would have come home early.

13:00.687 --> 13:03.254
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't we order that special pizza

13:03.279 --> 13:06.118
- from Sal's, the Ma Che Bella.
- Actually, I can't stay.

13:06.143 --> 13:08.276
- Mom called, on her way over.
- I'll invite her too!

13:08.308 --> 13:11.669
Then we can order that big one we're always
afraid to order, that... What's it called?

13:11.694 --> 13:13.334
- Gigante!
- Gigante!

13:13.359 --> 13:15.528
Yeah, if Mom's OK with it.

13:15.553 --> 13:17.600
Why wouldn't she be OK with it?
She spent half of last year

13:17.625 --> 13:20.584
- in Italy, didn't she?
- Very true.

13:21.514 --> 13:23.835
Hey, come on in.
We're gonna order from Sal's.

13:23.860 --> 13:26.335
- That is a great idea!
- Pizza it is!

13:26.360 --> 13:29.194
Yeah, hang on a sec, Maggie?
Hey, is she ready?

13:29.704 --> 13:32.085
Uhh, yeah.

13:32.110 --> 13:33.977
I-I thought maybe we could
all have dinner together.

13:34.002 --> 13:36.483
Ohh, I have an early call tomorrow.

13:36.508 --> 13:38.568
OK, I'll bring her by later.

13:38.593 --> 13:40.926
- Jules has homework.
- But she could do it here.

13:40.951 --> 13:42.788
Yeah, Maggie, one second.

13:42.813 --> 13:44.574
Matt, you're seeing her tomorrow.

13:44.599 --> 13:46.944
I gotta take her home. Now.

13:46.969 --> 13:49.827
Sorry, Dad. We'll get
the gigante next time.

13:49.852 --> 13:51.389
- Sushi tomorrow, right?
- You got it.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.708
- Bye, Grandpa.
- Bye, sweetie.

13:58.669 --> 14:00.778
To hell with the pizza.
Let's go get a drink.

14:00.803 --> 14:04.719
Maybe some other time, Dad.

14:05.530 --> 14:07.014
Emilia, what's up?

14:07.039 --> 14:09.973
Shade? You need to get
down here right away.

14:10.006 --> 14:12.986
[Someone set the garage on fire.]

14:16.599 --> 14:19.528
I was by the East gate when I saw it.
Ran over

14:19.553 --> 14:21.551
and tried to put it out. It got too big.

14:21.576 --> 14:24.482
Did you see anyone?

14:24.507 --> 14:27.641
He just got a mouthful of smoke,
can this wait?

14:30.147 --> 14:32.865
None of the other security
guards remembers seeing anyone.

14:32.890 --> 14:36.319
I guess open flames near racing
fuel can be a bit of a distraction.

14:36.344 --> 14:37.944
Where are you going? Hold on!

14:37.969 --> 14:39.926
- Are you kidding me?
- Listen, calm down.

14:39.951 --> 14:41.772
You guys need to figure
out who's doing this;

14:41.797 --> 14:43.701
- we're running out of time.
- You should consider

14:43.726 --> 14:46.131
- pulling out of the race.
- We can't. Look, I've waited

14:46.156 --> 14:48.850
20 years for this chance.
We have never been this close.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.514
This is our shot at the big time.

14:50.539 --> 14:52.123
At least, let us talk to the police.

14:52.148 --> 14:55.584
- We've got friends there that...
- No. No police.

14:55.609 --> 14:58.342
She hired you to solve this,
so solve it already.

15:00.210 --> 15:03.630
I'm sorry. He's under a lot of pressure.

15:03.655 --> 15:06.223
- More than usual?
- He hasn't won a race in three months,

15:06.248 --> 15:08.678
and he knows if we don't get a
top-three finish on Saturday,

15:08.703 --> 15:11.081
we lose our chance at the bonus.

15:11.106 --> 15:13.487
I just gotta get him to focus.

15:30.743 --> 15:33.628
Angie?

15:33.653 --> 15:35.294
_

15:35.319 --> 15:37.060
Hey, I was thinking about the fire...

15:37.085 --> 15:39.584
What is this? Some kind of a joke?

15:39.609 --> 15:42.334
Uh... No.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.526
When were you planning

15:44.551 --> 15:46.107
to give it to me?

15:46.203 --> 15:47.869
Soon.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.854
I was just...

15:49.879 --> 15:52.160
waiting for the right time.

15:52.529 --> 15:55.246
Sorry.

15:57.381 --> 15:58.986
Where was it?

15:59.011 --> 16:01.921
It was taped under your dad's desk.

16:02.992 --> 16:04.992
You want some privacy?

16:05.017 --> 16:07.499
- I can...
- No. No. I'll read it later.

16:07.523 --> 16:09.496
Later? I've been dying

16:09.521 --> 16:12.085
- to find out...
- I said no, OK?

16:14.315 --> 16:16.183
You were saying about the fire?

16:16.208 --> 16:20.183
Uh, it must have been an inside job.
That entire area

16:20.208 --> 16:22.375
is only accessible
with team credentials.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.400
Not to mention you'd
have to know to avoid

16:24.425 --> 16:27.195
the security cameras,
which brings us back to a rival racer

16:27.219 --> 16:30.243
- or his crew.
- Or Emilia's crew.

16:30.628 --> 16:33.529
I did some digging into
Emilia's financial situation.

16:33.554 --> 16:36.982
Ronny was right; even with the bigger
sponsor, she's in a lot of trouble.

16:37.007 --> 16:39.052
The bank called one of
her loans last month;

16:39.077 --> 16:40.865
she had to let go of her chief engineer.

16:41.137 --> 16:43.137
Tim Reid.

16:51.797 --> 16:53.764
Are you Tim Reid?

16:54.094 --> 16:55.845
Who's asking?

16:55.937 --> 16:58.405
We're working for Emilia Mantella.

16:58.430 --> 17:00.728
Someone set a fire at
the track last night.

17:00.861 --> 17:03.913
What's that got to do with me?

17:03.938 --> 17:06.531
- You still got your credential?
- I freelance

17:06.556 --> 17:08.617
every once in a while,
but I wasn't there last night.

17:08.642 --> 17:11.806
- Where were you?
- At home, watching the game.

17:11.830 --> 17:15.465
- Were you alone?
- Guys, I didn't do this.

17:15.491 --> 17:17.590
This isn't exactly the big time.

17:17.616 --> 17:21.031
Maybe you were pissed she let you go,
maybe you wanted to get back at her.

17:21.057 --> 17:23.334
Oh, I didn't get fired. I quit.

17:23.358 --> 17:26.251
What happened?

17:26.276 --> 17:28.276
Eric and I got into a fight.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.430
He wanted me to make some
adjustments to his car.

17:30.454 --> 17:32.087
Add Gurney flaps to the tail wing

17:32.112 --> 17:34.742
for more downforce. I told him
it'd be dangerous, that it could

17:34.767 --> 17:36.571
- throw off the balance.
- He didn't like that?

17:36.596 --> 17:38.933
No. He tried to force me to do it.

17:38.958 --> 17:41.853
I said no. He freaked out, so I left.

17:41.878 --> 17:44.725
- No hard feelings?
- Well, sure.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.900
I've been with the team for seven years.

17:46.925 --> 17:48.290
Emilia's like a mom,

17:48.315 --> 17:50.837
and Eric and I were tight.
But then lately, he's been

17:50.862 --> 17:52.368
acting all crazy, so I figured...

17:52.393 --> 17:53.990
What do you mean, "crazy"?

17:54.024 --> 17:55.774
He star to losing races.

17:55.845 --> 17:57.076
Yelling at people,

17:57.101 --> 17:58.688
getting into fights...

17:58.713 --> 18:02.049
I tried talking sense into him
but he completely shut me out.

18:02.074 --> 18:04.040
Thanks.

18:09.243 --> 18:11.244
What?

18:11.361 --> 18:13.717
The way he described Eric,

18:13.742 --> 18:15.742
I've seen it before in elite athletes.

18:15.767 --> 18:17.124
Skilled jugglers, you mean.

18:17.149 --> 18:18.938
Back in my playing days,
guys who'd have a couple

18:18.963 --> 18:21.217
of bad games, they'd start
looking for things to blame.

18:21.242 --> 18:24.037
A nagging injury.
Faulty equipment. The water boy.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.373
Is this trip down memory
lane headed anywhere?

18:26.398 --> 18:28.404
Eric was riding a losing streak.

18:28.487 --> 18:30.287
Maybe he was trying to find a reason

18:30.312 --> 18:31.295
not to race at all.

18:31.320 --> 18:34.546
Like issuing death threats that
force his team to pull out.

18:42.631 --> 18:44.227
Oh, I just spoke to Emilia.

18:44.252 --> 18:46.638
She and Eric had dinner plans,
so the coast should be clear.

18:46.663 --> 18:48.930
Eric has a motor home on site; I figure

18:48.955 --> 18:51.339
that's a good place to start.

18:52.262 --> 18:54.262
Hey, Jules, what's up?

18:54.287 --> 18:57.321
I was wondering if we could
postpone dinner tonight.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.379
Sure. Is everything OK?

18:59.404 --> 19:01.719
Yeah, Mom just asked me to stay home.

19:01.744 --> 19:03.410
Why?

19:03.435 --> 19:05.298
Um, she has the night off.

19:05.323 --> 19:07.524
You know how she gets.
I think she's lonely.

19:07.591 --> 19:09.958
Please don't tell her
I said anything though.

19:10.133 --> 19:13.305
Yeah, OK, honey. I'll see you next week.

19:13.330 --> 19:15.154
Love you.

19:15.382 --> 19:17.882
Yeah, lonely my ass.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.325
What's going on?

19:20.350 --> 19:22.584
I have a standing sushi
dinner date with Jules

19:22.609 --> 19:24.609
every Thursday.
It's a little thing we worked out

19:24.634 --> 19:27.236
between the two of us.
Now, Becca wants her to stay home.

19:27.261 --> 19:28.501
You think she's doing it on purpose.

19:28.526 --> 19:31.265
Bad enough she forced me into
this 90/10 split; now, she wants

19:31.290 --> 19:33.219
to take away the one thing I
look forward to every week?!

19:33.244 --> 19:36.172
OK, easy. I'm sure she'll be
reasonable if you talk to her

19:36.197 --> 19:38.197
- about it.
- Oh, and I will.

19:38.222 --> 19:40.901
Right after.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.517
There it is.
You keep watch while I go inside.

19:46.542 --> 19:49.250
Whoa, whoa, why do I have to
be lookout man when it's cold?

19:49.275 --> 19:51.190
Can you pick a lock?

19:51.215 --> 19:53.192
Fine.

20:38.242 --> 20:40.326
What?!

20:40.351 --> 20:42.533
- [Eric's here, get out.]
- What?!

20:44.813 --> 20:46.704
Angie!

20:51.476 --> 20:53.756
Hey! Eric!

20:53.781 --> 20:55.812
What are you doing
here? It's after hours.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.602
Uhhh, my partner and I

20:57.626 --> 21:00.236
were looking for clues in the garage.
We thought

21:00.261 --> 21:02.163
whoever wrote that message
might have dropped something.

21:02.188 --> 21:04.351
Did you find anything?

21:04.376 --> 21:07.022
Actually, it's locked.
Could you let us in?

21:07.047 --> 21:08.515
Sure. I have a spare key in here.

21:08.540 --> 21:10.226
You know what? I just remembered

21:10.251 --> 21:13.874
I've already got one. But I don't
know how to turn on the lights.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.805
There's a switch on
the wall by the door.

21:16.830 --> 21:19.196
Right. Of course there is.

21:19.221 --> 21:23.148
- Hahahaha!
- Where's your partner?

21:24.199 --> 21:28.101
- Why is this open?
- Wait, Eric,

21:28.126 --> 21:30.187
umm... Wait! I...

21:45.844 --> 21:48.195
Sorry. Where did you
say your partner was?

21:48.220 --> 21:51.242
She's in the garage.
We could really use your help.

21:51.267 --> 21:53.479
OK.

22:01.108 --> 22:03.867
Oh, hey.

22:04.456 --> 22:06.591
You guys are in a lot of trouble.

22:06.616 --> 22:09.189
Yeah, join the club.

22:09.214 --> 22:11.742
Ready to explain why
you've been lying to us?

22:18.133 --> 22:20.367
How long has this been going on?

22:20.392 --> 22:23.334
- I don't know. A while.
- Why didn't you tell me about this?

22:23.359 --> 22:24.601
Didn't think it was important.

22:24.626 --> 22:26.710
Didn't think it important to
tell me someone was after you?!

22:26.735 --> 22:29.141
It's nothing, OK? It's
just some crazy fan.

22:29.166 --> 22:31.060
These don't sound like
they're from a fan.

22:31.085 --> 22:34.109
Stalker then. Didn't you have
stalkers when you played pro hockey?

22:34.134 --> 22:36.117
Did you bother to figure
out who each one was?

22:36.142 --> 22:38.693
Is this why you've been losing races?
Because you're worried about this?

22:38.718 --> 22:40.685
It's always about the races with you,
isn't it?

22:40.710 --> 22:42.586
Well, don't worry.
I'm still going to drive tomorrow.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.614
Eric, wait.

22:45.394 --> 22:47.394
He's hiding something.

22:47.419 --> 22:50.741
Oh yeah.
But how do we figure out what it is?

22:50.766 --> 22:52.330
Maybe this will help.

22:52.355 --> 22:54.820
Maz just got the blood
results back from the lab.

22:54.845 --> 22:56.584
That's good news.

22:57.002 --> 23:00.237
OK, this is for you.

23:00.262 --> 23:02.398
- And this is for you.
- What's this?

23:02.423 --> 23:04.631
My sponsor form for the 10K.
Pony up, Puck Boy.

23:04.656 --> 23:06.822
Well, you realize that 10K is no picnic,
right?

23:06.847 --> 23:08.664
Why does everybody keep saying that?
I have a gym membership.

23:08.689 --> 23:11.328
So what? I got a library
card, doesn't mean I use it.

23:11.353 --> 23:13.387
- You have a library card?
- Mhm.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.101
What do they mean, there's no DNA?

23:15.126 --> 23:17.888
- Yeah. Thought you'd like that.
- How can blood have no DNA?

23:17.913 --> 23:20.562
What am I? Trapper John M.D.?
How would I know?

23:20.587 --> 23:23.287
There you are. I heard
you were coming in.

23:23.312 --> 23:25.796
- Shade.
- Nolan.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.965
See you brought the
sunshine back with you.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.328
Sorry didn't call last night,
I got caught up with this case.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.585
- Right back at it as usual.
- Yep. I'll call you later.

23:33.610 --> 23:35.706
Mm-hmm.

23:37.172 --> 23:39.516
I need to talk to the lab
tech who prepared this report.

23:39.541 --> 23:42.297
Of course you do. After me.

23:44.587 --> 23:46.555
Hey, sorry to hear you got sick.

23:46.580 --> 23:48.753
- What?
- It's the tropics, man.

23:48.778 --> 23:50.668
You gotta be careful
down there. One time,

23:50.693 --> 23:53.194
I bought a chicken skewer off
a street vendor in Jamaica.

23:53.219 --> 23:55.316
They basically had to repaint

23:55.341 --> 23:58.364
- my entire hotel bathroom.
- Who told you I got sick?

23:58.389 --> 24:00.712
That why you're back early, isn't it?

24:00.737 --> 24:02.608
Right.

24:02.843 --> 24:05.965
- Uh, I gotta...
- Good.

24:10.108 --> 24:15.955
- Ha! That's good! Hey!
- Shadow! Grab a glass and join us.

24:17.309 --> 24:19.611
Becca, what are you doing here?

24:19.636 --> 24:22.570
I'm waiting for Jules to call.
I figured I'd drop by

24:22.595 --> 24:24.762
and tell you guys the news.

24:25.263 --> 24:28.098
- They're greenlighting my show!
- Really?

24:28.123 --> 24:30.223
They're announcing it tomorrow!

24:30.334 --> 24:32.934
What do you mean,
"waiting for Jules to call"?

24:32.959 --> 24:34.926
Oh, she went to the
mall with her friends.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.684
I thought you knew.

24:36.877 --> 24:38.853
Aren't you gonna congratulate me?

24:38.878 --> 24:41.683
- Yes! Congratulations!
- Thank you!

24:41.708 --> 24:43.285
I thought you two were
hanging out tonight.

24:43.310 --> 24:47.026
No. I had a network meeting.
It's been planned for a week.

24:47.245 --> 24:50.823
Oh! That's her.

24:50.848 --> 24:53.715
I can't wait to tell her the good news.

24:53.740 --> 24:56.871
- Bye, Don.
- Bye, sweetie.

24:56.896 --> 24:59.623
- Bye, Shadow.
- Alright.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.730
I'll tell Jules that you say

25:01.754 --> 25:04.411
- hi!
- Yeah. Um, Becca,

25:04.962 --> 25:06.728
congratulations.

25:06.753 --> 25:09.688
Thank you.

25:12.534 --> 25:14.535
You wanna tell me what
that was all about?

25:14.560 --> 25:16.002
Jules and I were supposed

25:16.027 --> 25:18.447
- to have dinner tonight.
- And she chose

25:18.473 --> 25:21.493
her friends instead?
I'll call the news desk at the Star.

25:21.518 --> 25:23.551
She told me she was
hanging out with Becca.

25:23.576 --> 25:25.112
She lied to me.

25:25.137 --> 25:27.525
OK. But she's a teenager,

25:27.550 --> 25:29.194
it kind of comes with the territory.

25:29.219 --> 25:31.135
Really!? I don't remember

25:31.160 --> 25:33.861
this laissez-faire attitude the
night I took your truck over

25:33.886 --> 25:36.198
- to Heather Mancini's house.
- You broke my tail light!

25:36.223 --> 25:38.682
I did not break your
tail light. Mom broke

25:38.707 --> 25:40.908
your tail light. She backed
into a pole in the parking lot

25:40.933 --> 25:43.403
of the IGA! It's why she
bought you those fudge cookies

25:43.427 --> 25:45.640
- for two months.
- Alright, alright, fine, but...

25:45.665 --> 25:48.010
- this is a different situation
- How is this different?!

25:48.035 --> 25:51.682
Because Jules is struggling
with this custody arrangement!

25:51.707 --> 25:53.511
Same as you.

25:53.536 --> 25:55.834
She's trying to make her mother happy,

25:55.859 --> 25:58.293
you happy, and still live her
own life at the same time!

25:58.318 --> 26:00.244
So I'm supposed to give her a pass,
is that it?

26:00.269 --> 26:02.186
No.

26:02.211 --> 26:05.612
I just want you to talk to her
before you fly off the handle.

26:11.291 --> 26:13.516
What are you doing here?

26:13.541 --> 26:16.316
- It's not even 8 a.m.!
- We've only got about 6 hours

26:16.340 --> 26:18.494
until race time. Early
bird gets the worm.

26:18.738 --> 26:21.793
- What's all this?
- Alright, I tracked

26:21.818 --> 26:23.542
the dates of Eric's races
against the postmarks

26:23.567 --> 26:25.567
on the envelopes of the
threatening messages.

26:25.592 --> 26:28.415
First one came three months ago
while the team was in Daytona.

26:28.417 --> 26:31.745
- Let me guess: he lost the race.
- He came in fourth.

26:31.770 --> 26:34.504
Next came Winnipeg,
Knoxville, Corpus Christi.

26:34.529 --> 26:37.029
Eric received a message at
each one of those tracks.

26:37.054 --> 26:38.667
And he kept losing.

26:38.692 --> 26:40.549
So you're thinking something
happened before Daytona,

26:40.574 --> 26:43.113
something the note writer knows about.

26:44.722 --> 26:48.358
"I KNOW WHAT YOU DID."
And it must have happened here.

26:48.382 --> 26:49.590
How do you know that?

26:49.615 --> 26:51.380
Each one of those
messages was sent by mail,

26:51.406 --> 26:53.506
except for the message
in Emilia's garage.

26:53.531 --> 26:56.476
That was obviously done in person.
Not to mention the fire.

26:56.501 --> 26:58.956
So all we gotta do is
figure out what happened

26:58.981 --> 27:00.953
before the Daytona race.

27:01.073 --> 27:03.073
I'll go shower.

27:03.146 --> 27:05.370
You know, I'm pretty
handy with the loofa.

27:05.559 --> 27:07.965
Early bird doesn't get
all the worms, Shade.

27:07.990 --> 27:09.878
Right.

27:10.326 --> 27:12.855
Three months? That's a long time ago.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.589
Try and remember. Did you notice

27:14.615 --> 27:17.720
Eric acting strange?
It was before you went to Daytona.

27:17.974 --> 27:20.222
You know, come to think of it,
that's about when it started.

27:20.247 --> 27:23.014
One day, he's fine; the next,
he's acting all paranoid.

27:23.039 --> 27:24.852
Any idea what was bothering him?

27:24.877 --> 27:27.521
No clue. He would just
hide out in his motor home.

27:27.546 --> 27:30.269
I remember inviting him to my sister's
birthday, and he just went nuts.

27:30.294 --> 27:32.995
- And when was that?
- Her birthday's on the 15th,

27:33.020 --> 27:35.654
- so before that.
- OK, thanks.

27:35.679 --> 27:37.948
Let us know if you
think of anything else.

27:39.363 --> 27:43.713
- Hey, wait a minute! There's his car too.
- What about it?

27:43.738 --> 27:46.104
Well, he had it repainted
around that same time.

27:46.129 --> 27:49.105
- So?
- Who takes a black '69 Mustang

27:49.130 --> 27:50.590
and paints it canary yellow?

27:50.615 --> 27:53.278
Even worse, Mantella has a
state-of-the-art paint room

27:53.303 --> 27:57.593
on site, yet he farms it out to
some random shop in Etobicoke.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.713
"Otto's Bodies"?

28:03.738 --> 28:07.440
Eric showed up there at 6:30 a.m.
before the shop even opened. Paid cash

28:07.465 --> 28:09.699
to have his car completely repainted.
We're looking

28:09.724 --> 28:11.724
for a traffic incident that
happened the night before.

28:11.769 --> 28:14.159
Alright. Oof! Oh, I tell you,

28:14.184 --> 28:16.667
I'm still sore from giving
her at the gym last night.

28:16.692 --> 28:18.605
Ugh!

28:22.351 --> 28:24.441
Alright, a single-car accident

28:24.466 --> 28:26.839
involving a white sports sedan.
Skidded out of control

28:26.864 --> 28:31.183
- and hit a light post at 150km/h.
- We need a black Mustang.

28:31.212 --> 28:33.855
Patience, my sun-kissed island friend.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.050
"Eyewitnesses reported a black Mustang

28:36.075 --> 28:38.208
fleeing the scene at high speed."

28:38.233 --> 28:40.606
Two cars,
high-speed crash; he was drag racing.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.605
If he clipped him, it's more than that.
It's a hit-and-run.

28:42.630 --> 28:44.652
What's the name of the injured driver?

28:44.682 --> 28:47.402
"Danny Gibson. Immediately transported

28:47.427 --> 28:50.312
to Memorial Hospital
in critical condition."

28:51.218 --> 28:53.482
So how is it that you know Danny?

28:53.507 --> 28:56.339
- We're friends of the family.
- It'll be a nice surprise

28:56.364 --> 28:59.355
for him. He doesn't get many visitors.

28:59.613 --> 29:01.808
Danny, someone's here to see you.

29:01.833 --> 29:04.618
Can I help you?

29:09.742 --> 29:12.501
Still dream about it sometimes.

29:12.526 --> 29:14.592
You know, running through a forest

29:14.617 --> 29:16.505
or down a big hill.

29:16.530 --> 29:19.299
It looks different.
It's hard to explain.

29:19.324 --> 29:21.441
You think of getting a prosthetic?

29:21.466 --> 29:23.887
They fitted me for one,
but it's expensive,

29:23.925 --> 29:25.925
and insurance only covers part of it.

29:25.950 --> 29:28.441
You're doing this all by yourself?

29:28.466 --> 29:29.810
Mhm. Got no choice.

29:29.835 --> 29:33.147
My parents died years ago,
and my girlfriend...

29:33.304 --> 29:36.715
she couldn't get past what happened.
She's an EMT,

29:36.740 --> 29:40.241
- she's seen how this ruins lives.
- So,

29:40.266 --> 29:43.027
- the night of the accident...
- I don't even remember it.

29:43.052 --> 29:45.492
I mean, I remember how it started.

29:45.845 --> 29:47.828
I stopped at a red light,

29:47.853 --> 29:50.777
and this '69 souped-up Mustang

29:50.802 --> 29:52.802
pulls up next to me.

29:53.173 --> 29:55.507
Revved my engine. He revved his back.
And that was that.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.308
- Did you get a look at the guy?
- Nah, it was too dark.

29:58.341 --> 30:00.887
Why, do you guys know who it was?

30:00.911 --> 30:02.652
- No.
- Son of a bitch watched me

30:02.677 --> 30:04.470
crash into a pole and just...

30:04.495 --> 30:07.558
drove away. Who does that?

30:07.583 --> 30:10.191
- Did you ever want to find him?
- Yeah, I used to.

30:10.216 --> 30:13.353
But now for what?
So... so I can yell at him?

30:15.403 --> 30:17.357
It is what it is.

30:17.726 --> 30:22.112
I'm still here, so there's that.

30:23.910 --> 30:26.463
- Poor kid. I feel for him.
- I don't get it.

30:26.488 --> 30:28.815
I thought so sure Danny was
the one sending the threats.

30:28.840 --> 30:31.747
We have to get to the track,
the race starts in an hour...

30:31.772 --> 30:34.363
- What are you doing?
- Look.

30:34.388 --> 30:37.002
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

30:37.027 --> 30:38.651
The blood in Emilia's garage...

30:38.676 --> 30:40.879
Could come from a blood bag. Excuse me.

30:40.904 --> 30:43.967
Is it possible for blood
to not have DNA in it?

30:44.312 --> 30:46.252
It's a bar bet.

30:46.277 --> 30:47.847
OK...

30:47.872 --> 30:50.572
When people donate blood,
it's separated into plasma

30:50.597 --> 30:52.777
- and red blood cells.
- And those red blood cells...?

30:52.802 --> 30:56.355
Have no nuclei.
That's where the DNA comes from.

30:57.540 --> 31:00.359
Dr. Palmer,
who here in the hospital has access

31:00.384 --> 31:02.550
- to blood bags?
- Lots of people.

31:02.575 --> 31:05.263
Doctors, nurses,
and a variety of technicians.

31:05.288 --> 31:08.120
- Anyone close to Danny?
- Why do you want to know that?

31:08.145 --> 31:09.811
Please, it's important.

31:09.907 --> 31:12.496
I can't think of anyone in particular.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.557
- What's going on?
- Someone sent

31:15.582 --> 31:17.527
death threats written in
blood to a client of ours.

31:17.552 --> 31:19.956
The guy who did this to me,
you know who he is.

31:19.981 --> 31:21.981
- We think he's in danger.
- I already told you,

31:22.006 --> 31:25.215
- I don't know anything.
- Danny, listen to me.

31:25.240 --> 31:28.537
The guy you were racing,
he made a mistake, same as you;

31:28.562 --> 31:30.495
you really want him to die for it?

31:30.885 --> 31:34.026
Your ex-girlfriend. You
said she was an EMT.

31:34.138 --> 31:36.688
Jen...

31:36.713 --> 31:39.114
she was always going on about
how she wanted to find out

31:39.139 --> 31:41.245
who did it, make him pay.

31:41.270 --> 31:44.538
She even had a cop buddy of hers
give her a list of Mustang owners.

31:44.563 --> 31:46.527
Look, I told her that I
didn't want to live like that,

31:46.552 --> 31:49.533
but she was obsessed.
That's why we split up.

31:49.565 --> 31:52.411
You have a picture of her?

31:53.491 --> 31:56.328
She was at the fire.

31:59.316 --> 32:02.502
We are finally here, folks.
The big race! The cars

32:02.527 --> 32:04.964
are slowly getting into
position for the start.

32:04.989 --> 32:07.790
Just a perfect day for a race today.

32:08.072 --> 32:10.072
Let's take a moment
to thank our sponsors

32:10.097 --> 32:12.558
Violante Performance, Brown...

32:12.583 --> 32:14.850
You find Jen. I'll go warn Emilia.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.739
And they're off!

32:28.764 --> 32:31.404
This one's going to
be a good one, folks.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.795
Jen?

32:39.368 --> 32:42.002
Wait! Stop!

32:43.466 --> 32:46.464
Mantella pulls ahead.

32:48.831 --> 32:50.732
Caine's car's all over.

32:50.757 --> 32:53.749
Hey!

32:56.836 --> 32:59.004
I need to talk to you.

32:59.029 --> 33:01.287
- Not a good time, Shade.
- Eric's in danger.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.262
We think we found who sent the threats,
but she may have

33:03.287 --> 33:05.076
- sabotaged his car.
- She?!

33:05.101 --> 33:07.404
The Mantella car is trying
to pull out on its own.

33:07.429 --> 33:09.855
Ronny Caine tucked right
in there on his tail.

33:09.880 --> 33:12.317
There goes Eric Mantella.

33:12.342 --> 33:13.404
They checked the car this morning.

33:13.429 --> 33:15.327
Any chance they could
have missed something?

33:15.351 --> 33:16.803
No, no way.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.965
And when would she
have had access to it?

33:19.235 --> 33:22.309
The fire.
She may have used it as a diversion.

33:22.334 --> 33:26.004
That was two days ago. My guys have been
over that car ten times since then, Shade.

33:48.579 --> 33:50.237
What have you done with Eric?

33:50.262 --> 33:52.587
- You're too late.
- Caine and Mantella

33:52.612 --> 33:55.713
side by side. A great battle unfolding.

33:58.947 --> 34:01.015
Caine pulls ahead.

34:03.121 --> 34:05.087
Son of a bitch!

34:05.112 --> 34:08.187
What a battle, folks!

34:08.212 --> 34:10.978
- Mantella Autosport...
- Tell me you found her.

34:11.004 --> 34:13.710
- I did. Maz is on his way.
- Has she said anything?

34:13.735 --> 34:15.672
Only that it's too late for Eric.

34:15.697 --> 34:19.558
Alright, get her talking.
Find out what the hell she did.

34:22.202 --> 34:24.399
There's still time to stop this.

34:24.424 --> 34:26.898
- Why would I do that?
- Because this isn't you.

34:26.922 --> 34:29.636
You're an EMT; you heal people,
you don't kill them.

34:29.661 --> 34:33.581
Do you even know what happened?
He left Danny bleeding in a car.

34:33.607 --> 34:36.219
And then I find out that he's
this hotshot race-car driver?

34:36.245 --> 34:37.056
He made a mistake.

34:37.081 --> 34:39.963
- He ruined my life!
- Danny doesn't think his life is over.

34:39.987 --> 34:42.696
Danny has no idea how difficult his life

34:42.721 --> 34:44.721
- is about to be.
- You're angry, I get it,

34:44.746 --> 34:47.668
but things happen. You have to move on.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.830
Don't throw your whole

34:49.855 --> 34:53.592
life away.
Just tell me what you did to Eric's car.

35:03.102 --> 35:05.825
Angie?

35:05.850 --> 35:08.451
Tell Eric not to drink the water!
She put a sedative

35:08.476 --> 35:10.776
[in his onboard water
bottle, lorazepam.]

35:10.801 --> 35:12.653
Get on the radio. Tell Eric not to drink

35:12.678 --> 35:16.446
- the water!
- Eric, it's Mom.

35:16.471 --> 35:18.418
[I need you to come in on the next lap.]

35:18.443 --> 35:20.610
- What?! No, I'm in the lead.
- [Eric, listen to me.]

35:20.635 --> 35:23.713
- There's something in your water bottle.
- It's fine. I tasted it.

35:23.738 --> 35:25.215
- Eric!
- [Mom, stop!]

35:25.240 --> 35:27.959
- Let me do this!
- [Eric!]

35:28.701 --> 35:30.701
He's turned off his radio!

35:41.875 --> 35:44.685
- Whoa!
- Mantella's squirming all over

35:44.710 --> 35:47.444
- the place.
- Dumbass.

35:47.470 --> 35:50.805
- What's going on?
- Eric's in trouble.

35:55.317 --> 35:59.025
- He's gonna kill himself!
- You need to stop the race.

35:59.050 --> 36:01.284
We can't, he's not on his radio,

36:01.309 --> 36:03.442
only a red flag will do that.

36:03.467 --> 36:06.169
Shade!

36:17.320 --> 36:20.987
What?! There's an emergency
vehicle on the track.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.721
And there goes the red flag.
This race is under caution.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.285
He doesn't see the red flags.

37:07.680 --> 37:09.613
- What?
- Eric?

37:09.638 --> 37:13.072
Eric? Eric? Eric? Eric, stay with me.

37:36.299 --> 37:39.066
- You're gonna say yes, right?
- Guess so.

37:39.091 --> 37:40.986
Hey, Jules, you got a minute?

37:41.011 --> 37:43.576
Uh, yeah. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

37:44.071 --> 37:46.071
Hey, Dad, where's Mom?

37:46.103 --> 37:47.783
Um, I asked her if I could pick you up

37:47.808 --> 37:50.712
- to make up for the other night.
- OK.

37:50.737 --> 37:53.271
So listen, hmm...

37:54.103 --> 37:56.103
I understand that you
want to go to the mall

37:56.128 --> 37:57.806
with your friends sometimes,

37:57.831 --> 38:00.940
but you and I don't lie to each other.

38:00.965 --> 38:02.989
That's not us.

38:03.014 --> 38:06.409
- Yeah, I know.
- So what's the deal?

38:06.468 --> 38:08.990
We barely see each other,
and I didn't want you

38:09.015 --> 38:11.440
to get upset that I was
choosing my friends over you,

38:11.465 --> 38:14.940
and it was just easier not to tell you.

38:14.965 --> 38:16.742
Right.

38:16.767 --> 38:18.997
Jules, listen,

38:19.022 --> 38:21.823
I'll never get upset as
long as you're happy.

38:21.848 --> 38:23.848
That's all that's important to me.

38:23.994 --> 38:26.094
So next time, tell me the truth, OK?

38:26.119 --> 38:28.167
- I can handle it.
- OK.

38:28.439 --> 38:31.740
So what did you get
me at the mall anyway?

38:31.765 --> 38:34.365
- Better be something good.
- Well, do you like bras?

38:34.390 --> 38:36.856
- I got a lot of bras.
- Hmmm...

38:53.891 --> 38:55.992
Hey. You busy?

38:56.017 --> 38:58.017
No. Come in.

39:01.450 --> 39:03.733
Drink? I make a mean Mai Tai.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.553
I talked to Shade today.

39:06.804 --> 39:09.857
Uh, he said you told him I was sick.

39:09.882 --> 39:11.825
You know, Shade,
if I didn't give him a reason

39:11.850 --> 39:14.291
we came back early,
he'd just keep picking at it.

39:14.316 --> 39:16.302
Nah, I get why you lied to him;

39:16.327 --> 39:19.379
I just don't get why you lied to me.
Why did you tell me

39:19.404 --> 39:21.779
that you had to come home
for an emergency client?

39:22.209 --> 39:25.488
I just needed time to think.

39:25.513 --> 39:28.506
About us, what we're doing.

39:28.531 --> 39:31.532
"What we're doing"?
We're having fun is all.

39:32.548 --> 39:36.881
St. Lucia was great, don't get me wrong,
but it was also a lot.

39:37.069 --> 39:39.901
Waking up every morning,
spending every day together.

39:39.926 --> 39:41.451
That night at dinner, you asked me

39:41.476 --> 39:43.756
- to go to your cousin's wedding.
- I knew that was it.

39:43.781 --> 39:46.545
No, no, and you were right to ask.

39:46.570 --> 39:49.437
Why wouldn't you? I mean, we're supposed
to be together, aren't we? So...

39:49.462 --> 39:51.863
"Supposed to be"? Wow, OK.

39:51.888 --> 39:53.600
Hey, are we...

39:54.058 --> 39:56.998
Oh! Hey. Umm,

39:57.155 --> 39:59.155
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

39:59.180 --> 40:02.085
Nah, it's cool. I was just, uh...

40:02.110 --> 40:05.486
You two like you got a lot
going on so I'm just gonna...

40:05.672 --> 40:08.016
- Nolan, wait.
- No, I'm good. Uh,

40:08.041 --> 40:11.242
good luck with everything.

40:14.762 --> 40:17.081
What was that?

40:19.191 --> 40:21.258
What are you doing here?

40:21.826 --> 40:23.760
Ummm,

40:23.997 --> 40:26.169
timing may not be the best,

40:26.194 --> 40:29.310
but I got you something.

40:29.335 --> 40:31.302
Bring it in, boys.

40:40.504 --> 40:43.024
How did you...?

40:43.514 --> 40:46.815
I am a professional
investigator, remember?

40:47.044 --> 40:48.895
You'd be amazed what a few flyers put up

40:48.919 --> 40:51.424
around the neighbourhood can drum up.

40:51.792 --> 40:54.126
Well, aren't you gonna sit on it?

40:54.347 --> 40:56.246
Later.

40:56.271 --> 40:59.906
WOW! You are so much less excited
than I thought you were gonna be.

40:59.931 --> 41:02.839
I had to pay some hipster 500
bucks to get this thing back.

41:02.864 --> 41:05.880
Not to mention the 500 bucks
I had to spend on cleaning it!

41:05.961 --> 41:08.298
Sorry, it's fantastic.

41:08.961 --> 41:11.261
Thank you, Shade.

41:11.286 --> 41:12.685
Are you OK?

41:12.834 --> 41:15.057
I have to drive Jules home,

41:15.082 --> 41:16.641
but we could have dinner later.

41:16.666 --> 41:19.193
Well, there's something I gotta do.

41:19.218 --> 41:21.479
I've been putting it off.

41:23.710 --> 41:25.310
Right.

41:25.334 --> 41:28.001
Next time then.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.861
Next time.

41:35.978 --> 41:39.289
Nothing in that envelope is
gonna change who Bruce was.

41:39.314 --> 41:42.482
He was your dad.

41:42.507 --> 41:44.441
Always will be.

41:44.506 --> 41:46.047
You know that, right?

42:08.873 --> 42:10.706
Hey!

42:10.730 --> 42:13.064
How you doing, kiddo?

42:13.090 --> 42:15.447
Good. How did it go in there?

42:15.472 --> 42:17.174
Good.

42:39.374 --> 42:41.351
Come on. Come here.
