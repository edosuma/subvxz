00:15.700 --> 00:16.575
Hey.

00:18.450 --> 00:19.283
Do you smoke?

00:21.575 --> 00:22.658
In private.

00:24.033 --> 00:25.992
Cool, will
you do verbal abuse?

00:27.325 --> 00:29.323
Yeah, for sure.

00:29.325 --> 00:30.781
It'll be easier with you.

00:30.783 --> 00:31.658
I can just tell.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.492
Where are you from?

00:36.783 --> 00:37.781
San Francisco.

00:37.783 --> 00:39.240
I'm from New York City.

00:39.242 --> 00:41.533
I don't
care.

00:47.408 --> 00:50.367
I bet you wanna see my
tits so bad, don't you?

00:52.367 --> 00:53.656
Oh, fuck.

00:53.658 --> 00:54.492
Yeah.

00:56.492 --> 00:57.365
Okay, that's it.

00:57.367 --> 00:59.031
That's all you get.

00:59.033 --> 00:59.698
Fuck.

00:59.700 --> 01:00.658
I'm so fucking hard.

01:02.825 --> 01:04.198
Well, if you wanna
come, you have to tip me.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.242
Fuck, okay.

01:08.158 --> 01:09.281
You know what?

01:09.283 --> 01:10.406
Now I don't even
wanna smoke anymore.

01:10.408 --> 01:11.281
- Stick your tongue out.
- Okay.

01:11.283 --> 01:12.242
Stick your tongue out.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.823
Okay, I'm putting it
out on your tongue now.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.283
Okay.

01:18.825 --> 01:19.698
Swallow it.

01:19.700 --> 01:20.533
Swallow the butt.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.281
I want you to kiss
the bottom of my shoe.

01:25.283 --> 01:26.448
Ready?

01:26.450 --> 01:27.325
Kiss it.

01:29.825 --> 01:31.533
Lick it, lick it.

01:36.533 --> 01:37.700
You're so dumb.

01:39.325 --> 01:41.450
I bet you wanna come
on my ass, don't you?

01:42.533 --> 01:44.156
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

01:44.158 --> 01:45.365
Unfortunately,

01:45.367 --> 01:47.781
slaves don't get
to experience this.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.406
You guys can only
watch from afar.

01:52.408 --> 01:53.865
I want you to come hard for me.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.742
- Okay, slave?
- Okay.

01:57.492 --> 02:01.450
Oh God.

02:02.575 --> 02:04.240
- I'm coming.
- Yeah?

02:04.242 --> 02:05.448
Yeah.

02:05.450 --> 02:06.198
You
coming for me now?

02:06.200 --> 02:07.198
Uh-huh.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.448
Give
me all your cum.

02:08.450 --> 02:09.742
It's all mine.

02:11.117 --> 02:13.617
Yeah.

02:46.325 --> 02:47.615
Oh, hi.

02:47.617 --> 02:50.492
Do you have any sessions
available tonight?

02:54.242 --> 02:55.406
Oh, good.

02:55.408 --> 02:57.450
So how much usually
do you charge?

03:00.492 --> 03:01.325
220?

03:02.283 --> 03:03.240
Okay.

03:03.242 --> 03:04.492
And that's for all the way?

03:05.908 --> 03:09.242
Heads.

03:12.450 --> 03:13.325
Fuck.

03:25.325 --> 03:27.698
Oh, hey, Henry, did
you get my check?

03:27.700 --> 03:28.990
Yeah, three weeks late.

03:28.992 --> 03:29.825
Sorry, man.

03:31.783 --> 03:32.781
Where are you going?

03:32.783 --> 03:36.823
Out!

03:46.950 --> 03:48.948
Player
has blackjack!

03:48.950 --> 03:50.283
Yeah!

03:53.325 --> 03:55.533
Player busts.

04:00.742 --> 04:02.365
Please, dear God.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.615
- Dealer busts.
- Yes!

04:04.617 --> 04:06.865
Player wins.

04:06.867 --> 04:07.990
Dealer has blackjack.

04:07.992 --> 04:09.656
God damn it.

04:09.658 --> 04:11.323
Would
you like insurance?

04:11.325 --> 04:12.573
No.

04:12.575 --> 04:13.823
Come on, come on!

04:13.825 --> 04:14.865
Dealer
has blackjack.

04:14.867 --> 04:15.700
Fuck!

05:05.408 --> 05:06.281
Hi, babe.

05:06.283 --> 05:06.992
Wanna go private?

05:07.867 --> 05:08.823
Yeah,
mostly just chilling.

05:08.825 --> 05:11.406
I am actually about to
play some blackjack.

05:11.408 --> 05:12.781
Ooh!

05:12.783 --> 05:14.656
Yeah, it's actually
what I do for a living.

05:14.658 --> 05:15.781
Really?

05:15.783 --> 05:16.990
Really.

05:16.992 --> 05:18.823
What do you do,
like count cards?

05:18.825 --> 05:21.406
No, I don't count cards.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.948
I play online mostly,

05:22.950 --> 05:24.533
so you can't count them online.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.406
Do you wanna play with me?

05:27.408 --> 05:28.906
I could show you some strategy.

05:28.908 --> 05:30.950
We could even play
in the same room.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.865
Let's just do it.

05:33.867 --> 05:34.865
Let's just get in a
room and start playing.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.073
What do you think?

05:36.075 --> 05:37.406
Actually, babe,

05:37.408 --> 05:39.531
it's getting a little
bit late for me.

05:39.533 --> 05:40.698
Oh, really?

05:40.700 --> 05:41.656
Come on, we just
started chatting.

05:41.658 --> 05:42.615
Do you want me to tip you more?

05:42.617 --> 05:44.781
I can be generous with my tips.

05:44.783 --> 05:45.990
It
was nice to talk to you.

05:45.992 --> 05:46.948
Oh, for real?

05:46.950 --> 05:48.615
That's how it's gonna be?

05:48.617 --> 05:49.948
Sorry, babe.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.365
All right, well
I'm attracted to you.

05:52.367 --> 05:53.617
Gotta go, babe.

05:54.950 --> 05:55.783
Fuck.

06:18.408 --> 06:19.698
Hey, what's up?

06:19.700 --> 06:21.531
Look who it is.

06:21.533 --> 06:23.781
Good to see
you again.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.406
I didn't expect
you back so soon.

06:25.408 --> 06:27.365
I was pretty brutal last time.

06:27.367 --> 06:28.490
What have you been doing

06:28.492 --> 06:31.531
since we last spoke?

06:31.533 --> 06:32.490
Nothing much,

06:32.492 --> 06:33.825
just abusing slaves like you.

06:34.825 --> 06:36.490
Come on.

06:36.492 --> 06:38.823
How much do I have to tip
you for you to just like,

06:38.825 --> 06:41.367
drop the act a little
bit and just talk to me?

06:43.075 --> 06:44.740
200 Tokens.

06:44.742 --> 06:46.073
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:46.075 --> 06:48.033
Ooh, 200 tokens.

06:50.158 --> 06:54.031
I guess I used to
kind of enjoy painting.

06:54.033 --> 06:57.531
Wow, that's fucking
awesome.

06:57.533 --> 06:58.406
No, it's not.

06:58.408 --> 06:59.490
Yes, that's amazing!

06:59.492 --> 07:00.406
You're an artist?

07:00.408 --> 07:02.740
That's the coolest thing
I've heard all day.

07:02.742 --> 07:05.156
Ugh, well then your
life must be pretty boring

07:05.158 --> 07:08.198
if that's the coolest
thing you've heard all day.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.490
I'm impressed.

07:09.492 --> 07:10.740
Do you have anything
I could see,

07:10.742 --> 07:12.406
- like a painting to show me?
- No.

07:12.408 --> 07:13.617
What do you do?

07:20.533 --> 07:21.908
I work in the tech industry.

07:23.492 --> 07:24.906
Oh, cool.

07:24.908 --> 07:26.573
So you like, fix computers
and cell phones and stuff?

07:26.575 --> 07:27.573
Well, I
don't fix computers.

07:27.575 --> 07:29.656
I'm an app developer.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.115
Oh, cool.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.073
Well, I'm actually
currently developing this app

07:33.075 --> 07:34.656
that's gonna like,

07:34.658 --> 07:36.075
totally revolutionize the
way people communicate.

07:37.075 --> 07:38.240
Well, okay.

07:38.242 --> 07:40.700
Well, so basically,
it's a device

07:41.783 --> 07:44.198
that will allow people
to trade thoughts,

07:44.200 --> 07:45.990
like directly through the cloud

07:45.992 --> 07:47.781
without having to talk or type,

07:47.783 --> 07:50.698
but just think.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.115
Yeah, it's called See Stream.

07:52.117 --> 07:54.823
So is it like a chip?

07:54.825 --> 07:56.656
Like am I implanted?

07:56.658 --> 07:58.198
Basically using
nanotechnology,

07:58.200 --> 07:59.823
we're gonna develop a chip

07:59.825 --> 08:02.115
that goes into one of
the parts of your brain,

08:02.117 --> 08:04.240
which we're not sure yet.

08:04.242 --> 08:05.698
And it's gonna be something

08:05.700 --> 08:09.115
that basically
digitizes thoughts

08:09.117 --> 08:10.698
and allows them

08:10.700 --> 08:12.115
to be accessed by anyone
in the world that signs up

08:12.117 --> 08:14.531
for this subscription-based
service that we're offering.

08:14.533 --> 08:16.823
So I could hear someone's
thoughts from across the world,

08:16.825 --> 08:20.198
like a random person
that also has this chip?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.573
Yeah, yeah,
if they sign up

08:21.575 --> 08:22.865
for the See Stream, yeah.

08:22.867 --> 08:24.073
Whoa, that's cool!

08:24.075 --> 08:25.615
God, honestly,
I just can't wait

08:25.617 --> 08:26.823
for people to really
experience this

08:26.825 --> 08:28.698
because I think that
me talking about it

08:28.700 --> 08:30.198
doesn't really do it justice.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.698
Because I think when you hear
about it, you think like,

08:31.700 --> 08:34.198
"Oh, I get to read
someone's thoughts."

08:34.200 --> 08:36.073
They'd be like a
stream of thoughts

08:36.075 --> 08:37.240
or a stream of words.

08:37.242 --> 08:39.492
But when you're
inside See Stream,

08:40.700 --> 08:43.156
you're literally experiencing
someone's thoughts

08:43.158 --> 08:45.492
as if they were your thoughts.

08:46.867 --> 08:48.865
Would you love to know what
I'm thinking about right now?

08:48.867 --> 08:49.740
Yes, what
are you thinking?

08:49.742 --> 08:50.617
Can you tell me?

08:51.742 --> 08:53.948
That
you should tip me.

08:53.950 --> 08:54.990
I don't think
you're thinking that.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.740
What are you really think?

08:56.742 --> 08:58.823
Do you want me to smoke?

08:58.825 --> 08:59.990
Yeah, but
can you just tell me

08:59.992 --> 09:01.990
what you're thinking, please?

09:01.992 --> 09:03.156
I don't care.

09:03.158 --> 09:03.990
It doesn't have to
be anything cool.

09:03.992 --> 09:05.156
I just want to know.

09:05.158 --> 09:06.033
Ugh.

09:07.992 --> 09:09.198
I'm thinking that I wish I was

09:09.200 --> 09:12.117
as passionate about something
as you are about See Stream.

09:18.742 --> 09:19.906
Just do
me a favor, okay?

09:19.908 --> 09:22.117
Think of every person you know.

09:22.992 --> 09:24.156
Uh-huh.

09:24.158 --> 09:25.823
No, think, think.

09:25.825 --> 09:30.031
Think of your friends, your
lovers, people from work,

09:30.033 --> 09:33.031
your parents, your family,

09:33.033 --> 09:35.990
all the people you interact
with on social media.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.156
Are you thinking?

09:37.158 --> 09:38.075
Uh-huh.

09:39.575 --> 09:41.656
How do you
relate to these people?

09:41.658 --> 09:44.323
I don't
know, it depends.

09:44.325 --> 09:46.073
No, no, come on.

09:46.075 --> 09:50.200
Tell me, what's the common
thread in all your relationships?

09:54.033 --> 09:55.240
I don't know.

09:55.242 --> 09:59.198
You use these
people or they use you.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.906
That's not just because
you're a cam girl.

10:01.908 --> 10:05.031
Behind every single
interaction that you'll have

10:05.033 --> 10:06.575
is one,

10:08.242 --> 10:09.617
maybe two thoughts;

10:10.867 --> 10:11.990
what can I get out of this

10:11.992 --> 10:14.075
or what is it that
you're gonna do for me?

10:29.242 --> 10:31.698
I'ma put it out on your tongue.

10:31.700 --> 10:34.031
You feel the burning, don't you?

10:34.033 --> 10:36.823
Yeah, swallow it!

10:36.825 --> 10:38.281
Swallow it.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.240
What do you say?

10:47.242 --> 10:48.656
Thank you.

10:48.658 --> 10:50.740
Yeah, are you
gonna cum for me now?

10:50.742 --> 10:51.906
Yeah.

10:51.908 --> 10:52.823
Tell me when
you're about to cum.

10:52.825 --> 10:54.073
Okay.

10:54.075 --> 10:55.281
Tell me when
you're about to cum.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.033
You almost there?

11:00.992 --> 11:01.948
Yeah.

11:01.950 --> 11:03.740
Yeah, you're really close?

11:03.742 --> 11:04.406
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:04.408 --> 11:06.073
Okay, stop.

11:06.075 --> 11:06.950
Stop.

11:08.075 --> 11:09.156
Okay, let me see your hands.

11:09.158 --> 11:10.406
I wanna make sure you stopped.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.781
Let me see your hands.

11:16.283 --> 11:20.240
Ugh, you're so
disgusting.

11:24.867 --> 11:25.867
Hold this.

11:27.992 --> 11:31.990
Hey, when do you think
we can renew the lease?

11:31.992 --> 11:33.158
Can we do that today or?

11:36.158 --> 11:37.908
I'm not gonna
renew your lease.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.990
Look, I'm gonna
have some guys come

11:40.992 --> 11:42.156
and do some repairs next week.

11:42.158 --> 11:43.490
They're gonna repaint this wall

11:43.492 --> 11:45.658
and they're gonna
install that skylight.

11:47.908 --> 11:48.906
You know my subletter?

11:48.908 --> 11:49.906
He died,

11:49.908 --> 11:50.992
so he's been out for a bit.

11:52.158 --> 11:53.031
Not that you care,

11:53.033 --> 11:54.448
but all right, well.

11:54.450 --> 11:55.325
Oh.

11:57.825 --> 11:58.783
I didn't hear that.

12:17.117 --> 12:19.990
Fuck, what the
fuck is going on?

12:19.992 --> 12:20.867
Hey there.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.948
How are you?

12:23.950 --> 12:25.240
My name's William.

12:25.242 --> 12:27.115
You can call me Will.

12:27.117 --> 12:29.033
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

12:31.033 --> 12:32.992
This paint smells
like fucking shit.

12:34.283 --> 12:36.325
Yeah, I
guess you get used to it.

12:40.033 --> 12:43.198
Do you really have
to be doing this now?

12:43.200 --> 12:44.865
No.

12:44.867 --> 12:46.198
And we're getting paid to do it.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.450
Get it done a little
faster if you wanna help.

12:49.742 --> 12:51.740
You're not gonna
believe this shit, man.

12:51.742 --> 12:53.365
Honest to God.

12:53.367 --> 12:56.492
I'm in San Francisco in
1978 looking for a job.

12:57.867 --> 13:00.990
This guy has got this ad
looking for a sprayer,

13:00.992 --> 13:01.948
so I go up to see him.

13:01.950 --> 13:04.073
Old man, dingy office, right?

13:04.075 --> 13:05.781
Just me and him.

13:05.783 --> 13:09.031
Old guy looks like Willie
Nelson or something, right?

13:09.033 --> 13:10.406
And he says, "Hey man,
I looked at your resume.

13:10.408 --> 13:11.865
"I know you can spray.

13:11.867 --> 13:13.031
"You want this job?"

13:13.033 --> 13:14.323
I'm like, "Yeah,
I need the money.

13:14.325 --> 13:15.531
"I really need the money."

13:15.533 --> 13:16.865
He's like, "You sure
you want this job?"

13:16.867 --> 13:19.031
I'm like, "Yeah,
yeah, I want the job."

13:19.033 --> 13:21.323
Then he takes his nose, right,

13:21.325 --> 13:25.115
off of his face and he
puts it on his desk.

13:25.117 --> 13:27.906
I'm staring at these two holes
in the middle of his face.

13:27.908 --> 13:31.990
His nose is sitting on his
desk like a freaking trophy.

13:31.992 --> 13:33.365
I'm just looking at his nose.

13:33.367 --> 13:35.281
And I got freaked out.

13:35.283 --> 13:38.492
I didn't say yes, I didn't
say no, I just got up and ran.

13:40.033 --> 13:41.948
I mean, try to pick up some
chicks with that number, huh?

13:41.950 --> 13:44.573
You can't even get
any mercy action.

13:47.992 --> 13:49.406
Hey, do you mind if I
just throw some shit

13:49.408 --> 13:50.990
in that empty room?

13:50.992 --> 13:53.115
Yeah, sure, go for it.

13:53.117 --> 13:54.033
Thanks.

14:12.408 --> 14:16.948
So how are things
with the See Stream?

14:16.950 --> 14:18.656
Oh, thank you so
much for asking.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.490
They're great.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.825
You know,

14:24.075 --> 14:25.156
no, no, we had a phone meeting

14:25.158 --> 14:27.948
with one of my investors today,

14:27.950 --> 14:29.073
and it's incredible.

14:29.075 --> 14:32.281
He just okayed the
second round of funding.

14:32.283 --> 14:37.156
So I mean we're good
with our research.

14:37.158 --> 14:38.365
We can do the second phase.

14:38.367 --> 14:40.156
It's actually incredible.

14:40.158 --> 14:42.406
No way, really?

14:42.408 --> 14:43.573
Yeah.

14:43.575 --> 14:45.198
Oh my
God, congratulations.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.156
Well, thank you so much.

14:46.158 --> 14:47.073
That's great news.

14:47.075 --> 14:48.240
Yeah, I was actually thinking

14:48.242 --> 14:50.825
about See Stream earlier
today this morning.

14:51.950 --> 14:52.615
You were?

14:52.617 --> 14:53.490
Uh-huh.

14:53.492 --> 14:54.573
No way, really?

14:54.575 --> 14:55.865
Yep.

14:55.867 --> 14:57.198
What was the context?

14:57.200 --> 14:59.198
Well, I
was reading a book.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.365
What kind of book?

15:00.367 --> 15:01.990
I don't remember.

15:01.992 --> 15:02.867
Okay?

15:03.992 --> 15:04.990
But it
was a painting book,

15:04.992 --> 15:06.656
and I was just thinking like,

15:06.658 --> 15:09.573
it would be so cool to read it,

15:09.575 --> 15:13.450
or like, I dunno, I guess
experience it over See Stream.

15:16.367 --> 15:17.490
That is so cool

15:17.492 --> 15:18.531
that you were thinking
about See Stream

15:18.533 --> 15:20.367
just like in your personal life.

15:22.117 --> 15:23.240
Oh my God,

15:23.242 --> 15:25.115
that gives me all the
inspiration I could ever need

15:25.117 --> 15:26.198
for like, 10 lifetimes,

15:26.200 --> 15:27.365
like 10 See Streams.

15:27.367 --> 15:30.365
But you'll be inside the
mind of your favorite author.

15:30.367 --> 15:31.490
I mean,

15:31.492 --> 15:34.531
what could be a more gratifying
experience than that?

15:34.533 --> 15:36.573
Yeah, that's true.

15:36.575 --> 15:38.698
You could totally
understand not just

15:38.700 --> 15:39.656
because it's a painting book,

15:39.658 --> 15:42.323
not just like how they did it,

15:42.325 --> 15:43.656
'cause you could
only read so much

15:43.658 --> 15:45.365
from a historical
point of view, right?

15:45.367 --> 15:48.448
But if you are literally
inside the mind of the artist,

15:48.450 --> 15:53.198
you might be able to get
something of their soul.

15:59.367 --> 16:02.156
Hey man, did you put this
hole in the wall here, man?

16:02.158 --> 16:03.908
No, that
was my roommate.

16:06.075 --> 16:09.406
Are you as good at
blackjack as you say you are?

16:09.408 --> 16:11.031
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

16:11.033 --> 16:13.031
Yeah, can you
teach me a few things?

16:13.033 --> 16:14.031
Sure.

16:14.033 --> 16:15.240
Do you wanna play?

16:15.242 --> 16:16.406
Yeah,
man, I'd love to.

16:16.408 --> 16:17.365
Do you have money?

16:17.367 --> 16:18.406
I got a little bit of bread.

16:18.408 --> 16:19.573
What do you need?

16:19.575 --> 16:21.198
Well, I mean,
whatever you got.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.490
But you know, I
got a friend of mine.

16:22.492 --> 16:23.698
He loves cards.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.781
If he's not in jail,
he'd come right over.

16:25.783 --> 16:27.115
Okay, cool, let's do it.

16:27.117 --> 16:28.323
You don't mind?

16:28.325 --> 16:29.156
Mind?

16:29.158 --> 16:30.031
No, let's go!

16:30.033 --> 16:31.198
Let's go!

16:31.200 --> 16:33.031
All right, see,
14 against a four,

16:33.033 --> 16:34.448
some people would
say you have to stay,

16:34.450 --> 16:36.448
but with a player like me,

16:36.450 --> 16:37.323
how I'm feeling,

16:37.325 --> 16:39.281
you gotta put your balls

16:39.283 --> 16:40.281
- on the face cards.
- You already got

16:40.283 --> 16:41.115
two face cards.

16:41.117 --> 16:42.240
You're bound

16:42.242 --> 16:43.156
- to get another one.
- No, no, no, it's happening.

16:43.158 --> 16:44.323
See, you see?

16:44.325 --> 16:45.698
Didn't I say he'd
get another one?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.115
He's gonna bust, he's
gonna bust, he's gonna bust.

16:47.117 --> 16:48.531
- Yes!
- Yes, bust!

16:48.533 --> 16:52.281
That is so exactly how
I fucking fuck with them.

16:52.283 --> 16:53.992
That is how I
fucked them in the.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.115
- 1,000.
- Here we go,

16:56.117 --> 16:57.656
here we go, here we go, 16.

16:57.658 --> 16:58.990
20.

16:58.992 --> 16:59.656
- Stay, stay, stay!
- 20, stay, stay, stay!

16:59.658 --> 17:00.781
This is ours.

17:00.783 --> 17:01.740
Yes!

17:01.742 --> 17:03.656
- 1,000 bucks!
- Oh, shit!

17:03.658 --> 17:05.490
Yes, that's what I'm talking...

17:05.492 --> 17:06.490
Look at this balance.

17:06.492 --> 17:07.531
Look at this balance, bitches!

17:07.533 --> 17:09.115
Look at this fucking balance!

17:09.117 --> 17:10.115
4,500, man.

17:10.117 --> 17:11.823
- Oh my God, I'm hot!
- Yeah!

17:11.825 --> 17:14.156
Oh my God, I'm hot!

17:14.158 --> 17:15.323
Woo, yes!

17:15.325 --> 17:16.615
That is why they call
me Blackjack Jack.

17:16.617 --> 17:17.533
All right, okay.

17:19.158 --> 17:20.281
That's how we fucking,

17:20.283 --> 17:21.240
this is how we go.

17:21.242 --> 17:22.158
Blackjack Jack.

17:25.158 --> 17:27.367
Dealer 21, you lose.

17:31.408 --> 17:32.367
Yes!

17:34.325 --> 17:35.240
Player wins.

17:35.242 --> 17:36.117
Yes!

17:39.325 --> 17:41.656
Dealer 20, you lose.

17:41.658 --> 17:42.492
You.

17:45.492 --> 17:46.573
- Oh my God.
- Player busts.

17:46.575 --> 17:48.073
You lose.

17:48.075 --> 17:50.365
Please insert
money to play more.

18:03.242 --> 18:05.198
No more bets.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.283
35 black odd.

24:47.158 --> 24:49.240
You're
alienated from other people.

24:49.242 --> 24:51.117
I'm not, I see
people all the time.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.656
I do.

24:54.658 --> 24:56.573
And in fact, knowing
this about people

24:56.575 --> 24:58.948
makes me feel more
connected to them.

24:58.950 --> 25:01.656
When I was living
with the delusion

25:01.658 --> 25:03.240
that people actually
cared for me,

25:03.242 --> 25:05.198
it was much more
alienating than knowing

25:05.200 --> 25:07.240
that that was just false.

25:07.242 --> 25:08.948
You don't think
anyone cares for you?

25:08.950 --> 25:11.240
I think they do in moments

25:11.242 --> 25:13.531
when it props up
their own worldview

25:13.533 --> 25:15.573
about them as a caring person.

25:15.575 --> 25:20.575
♪ Nowhere else in this
world I'd rather be ♪

25:22.950 --> 25:26.531
♪ Than with you here ♪

25:26.533 --> 25:30.281
♪ Playing songs with me ♪

25:30.283 --> 25:32.865
Hey there, gorgeous.

25:32.867 --> 25:35.492
Damn, you really are gorgeous.

25:37.533 --> 25:38.992
Hello, are you there?

25:42.617 --> 25:43.492
Hello?

26:29.825 --> 26:32.281
Can I help you, sir?

26:32.283 --> 26:33.906
Oh.

26:33.908 --> 26:34.865
No.

26:34.867 --> 26:35.908
It's good, I'm sorry.

26:40.617 --> 26:42.698
Hey, Emma, what's up?

26:42.700 --> 26:44.323
I saw your text.

26:44.325 --> 26:45.700
You got plans tonight?

26:48.783 --> 26:51.073
Mic check.

26:51.075 --> 26:52.365
Look at you showing up!

26:52.367 --> 26:53.240
Oh, hey!

26:53.242 --> 26:54.406
Hey!

26:54.408 --> 26:56.031
Oh yeah, this
looks incredible.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.240
I ordered way
too many bottles of wine.

26:57.242 --> 26:58.406
Drink as much as you like.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.365
Mic check.

26:59.367 --> 27:00.575
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

27:01.992 --> 27:03.948
Who are friends over here?

27:03.950 --> 27:05.115
Oh my God, you've
gotta meet these guys.

27:05.117 --> 27:06.240
They're great.

27:06.242 --> 27:09.698
- Larry?
- Mic check.

27:09.700 --> 27:10.656
Mic check.

27:10.658 --> 27:11.948
Jack, what's up?

27:11.950 --> 27:13.656
Come over here for a second.

27:13.658 --> 27:15.656
Oh, hey, what's up, baby girl?

27:15.658 --> 27:17.323
So Larry, this
is my friend, Emma.

27:17.325 --> 27:19.406
Damn, look at that dress,
look at that little nose ring.

27:19.408 --> 27:20.948
- Nice to meet you, Emma.
- Nice to meet you.

27:20.950 --> 27:22.698
She made the art
here, this is all hers.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.698
- Wow, you made all this?
- Yeah, I did.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.073
- That's very impressive.
- Thank you.

27:26.075 --> 27:27.075
I like it.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.365
What do you think it's?

27:29.367 --> 27:30.990
It's beautiful.

27:30.992 --> 27:32.281
Not as beautiful as
you though, of course.

27:32.283 --> 27:33.865
Mic check.

27:33.867 --> 27:36.031
I actually know a couple
guys who are really into art

27:36.033 --> 27:38.281
that would probably
pay you very handsomely

27:38.283 --> 27:39.656
for selling them some art.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.823
You really know people
that would buy art?

27:40.825 --> 27:42.198
Yes, I do, I know
a lot of people.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.406
- For real?
- Yes, for real!

27:43.408 --> 27:45.115
Come on, you don't
know anyone like that.

27:45.117 --> 27:46.948
Why are you always
doubting me, bro?

27:46.950 --> 27:47.990
What?

27:47.992 --> 27:49.198
I'm not always doubting you.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.281
I mean, I know
you just met me,

27:50.283 --> 27:51.156
but like, come on.

27:51.158 --> 27:52.406
I'm a stand up guy.

27:52.408 --> 27:53.406
I need to teach you
how to box some day.

27:53.408 --> 27:54.406
- Come on.
- No, I can't.

27:54.408 --> 27:55.740
This is a civilized place.

27:55.742 --> 27:56.990
Nobody's doubting
my integrity.

27:56.992 --> 27:58.198
I'm not totally doubting...

27:58.200 --> 27:59.115
could do it all day.

27:59.117 --> 27:59.990
Learn how to box, man!

27:59.992 --> 28:01.781
Get into a hobby!

28:01.783 --> 28:03.906
Come on, come on, come on, Jack.

28:03.908 --> 28:05.323
I'm gonna be right back, I'll
be right back.

28:05.325 --> 28:06.781
Come on, Jack, come
on, Jack, come on, Jack.

28:06.783 --> 28:08.240
Wait, wait, wait.

28:08.242 --> 28:09.448
Watch out for her bread, man!

28:09.450 --> 28:10.865
I know, dude, dude.

28:10.867 --> 28:12.283
This guy's gonna
fuck up your art.

28:14.450 --> 28:16.323
Emma Voiceover: Mic check.

28:16.325 --> 28:18.158
Hey, I know you
ain't gonna grab me!

28:19.033 --> 28:20.033
Mic check.

28:20.992 --> 28:22.823
Dude, dude, shit.

28:22.825 --> 28:24.281
All right,
all right, all right.

28:24.283 --> 28:26.156
You are the superior boxer.

28:26.158 --> 28:27.031
Oh, whoa, whoa.

28:27.033 --> 28:28.323
Yeah, yeah, get strong.

28:28.325 --> 28:29.448
I like that.

28:29.450 --> 28:30.365
- I like that.
- Would you quit that?

28:30.367 --> 28:33.156
I like that, I like that.

28:33.158 --> 28:34.240
You've got some strength.

28:34.242 --> 28:36.031
I'll fucking kill you.

28:37.742 --> 28:38.408
Mic check.

28:42.992 --> 28:44.906
Mic check.

28:44.908 --> 28:45.781
Yeah.

28:45.783 --> 28:47.073
Larry!

28:47.075 --> 28:48.323
You underestimate
me, motherfucker?

28:48.325 --> 28:49.240
- Guys, what the fuck?
- Mic check.

28:49.242 --> 28:50.740
Are you
kidding me right now?

28:50.742 --> 28:52.156
Stop, stop, stop!

28:52.158 --> 28:53.325
Check.

28:54.492 --> 28:55.367
Mic check.

28:56.367 --> 28:57.948
Mic check.

28:57.950 --> 28:59.115
Ugh, another inane artwork

28:59.117 --> 29:00.950
on the failure of
Occupy Wall Street.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.198
Mic check.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.031
It wasn't a failure.

29:05.033 --> 29:06.448
Mic check.

29:06.450 --> 29:07.490
Well, I
didn't say it was a failure.

29:07.492 --> 29:09.031
No, you did.

29:09.033 --> 29:09.990
You just said Occupy Wall
Street was a failure.

29:09.992 --> 29:11.033
I think we all could agree

29:12.158 --> 29:14.240
that the artwork
could be stronger,

29:14.242 --> 29:16.781
but I do agree with you
that Occupy Wall Street

29:16.783 --> 29:18.281
as a movement was necessary.

29:18.283 --> 29:19.490
It was necessary.

29:19.492 --> 29:20.490
I mean, it spread
to 82 countries.

29:20.492 --> 29:23.990
It like, made the whole
idea of the class divide

29:23.992 --> 29:25.365
a popular concept.

29:25.367 --> 29:26.240
Yeah, but so what?

29:26.242 --> 29:27.198
What did it accomplish?

29:27.200 --> 29:28.198
No, but that's the point.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.448
It didn't accomplish anything.

29:30.450 --> 29:31.906
I mean,
nothing for nothing.

29:31.908 --> 29:33.490
You know any
rich guys that have any

29:33.492 --> 29:35.240
spare change lying around?

29:35.242 --> 29:36.990
Big spenders?

29:36.992 --> 29:39.075
My son got into this
really good college.

29:40.075 --> 29:43.073
Mic check.

29:57.408 --> 30:00.073
- Mic check.
- Mic check.

30:00.075 --> 30:02.406
- Mic check.
- Mic check.

30:02.408 --> 30:04.365
- Mic check.
- Mic check.

30:04.367 --> 30:07.406
- Mic check.
- Mic check.

30:07.408 --> 30:09.406
- Mic check.
- Mic check.

30:09.408 --> 30:12.073
- Mic check.
- Mic check.

30:12.075 --> 30:14.240
- Mic check!
- Mic check!

30:14.242 --> 30:16.240
- Mic check!
- Mic check!

30:16.242 --> 30:18.323
- Mic check!
- Mic check!

30:18.325 --> 30:20.240
- Mic check!
- Mic check.

30:20.242 --> 30:22.073
Mic...

30:22.075 --> 30:23.365
So what
are you up to now?

30:23.367 --> 30:26.033
Do you wanna maybe
come back to my spot?

30:29.158 --> 30:30.865
I thought we weren't allowed
to see each other again?

30:30.867 --> 30:32.198
No, I don't mean like that.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.198
- I don't mean like that!
- Part of your rules.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.281
I mean just as friends.

30:34.283 --> 30:35.906
We could hang out.

30:35.908 --> 30:38.948
I could play some blackjack,
show you some tricks.

30:38.950 --> 30:39.906
I don't want to watch
you play video games.

30:39.908 --> 30:41.531
It's not a fucking video game!

30:41.533 --> 30:43.156
It's my job!

30:43.158 --> 30:44.906
Look, just because I don't
have a conventional job

30:44.908 --> 30:46.323
like your idle yuppie friends

30:46.325 --> 30:48.950
- doesn't make me a fucking...
- Yuppie?

30:50.033 --> 30:51.281
What the fuck?

30:51.283 --> 30:53.073
- What the fuck?
- Is this the 80s?

30:53.075 --> 30:55.406
God, you gotta insult better.

30:58.408 --> 31:00.073
What?

31:00.075 --> 31:02.198
I gotta get
you another time.

31:02.200 --> 31:06.075
This is so typical.

31:09.075 --> 31:10.990
Can I get
some more wine?

31:10.992 --> 31:13.115
Yeah, I mean, there's
a store like on Bushwick,

31:13.117 --> 31:14.323
if you wanna go?

31:14.325 --> 31:15.531
Cool.

31:15.533 --> 31:17.325
Hey, I actually have
to make a phone call.

31:18.408 --> 31:20.825
So you want me to get it?

31:22.117 --> 31:24.323
Okay.

32:38.700 --> 32:42.658
Wait, so what's this
doppelganger that you've seen?

32:44.200 --> 32:47.115
I saw a girl and she
looks exactly like you.

32:47.117 --> 32:48.573
I bet she wasn't as hot as me.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.698
She looked exactly like you.

32:50.700 --> 32:53.283
Okay, well I've never
been to New York, so.

32:54.700 --> 32:57.283
Huh, can you smoke for me?

32:58.242 --> 32:59.698
Is that what you want?

32:59.700 --> 33:03.031
You wanna see smoke come out
of my big beautiful lips?

33:03.033 --> 33:04.073
Uh-huh.

33:04.075 --> 33:05.323
Yeah?

33:05.325 --> 33:06.200
Yeah.

33:09.117 --> 33:11.115
You know, Jackie?

33:11.117 --> 33:12.073
Maybe you're right.

33:12.075 --> 33:14.075
Maybe I do live next door.

33:14.992 --> 33:16.781
Wouldn't that be torture?

33:16.783 --> 33:18.198
Oh God, that would suck.

33:18.200 --> 33:22.115
To know that I'm so close?

33:22.117 --> 33:24.698
And you think about me all day

33:24.700 --> 33:28.073
and fantasize
about me all night.

33:28.075 --> 33:30.615
Don't you wish you could
play with my pussy?

33:30.617 --> 33:33.323
Slaves don't get to
play with my pussy.

33:34.325 --> 33:36.281
So you'll just have to
settle for the smoke.

33:36.283 --> 33:37.615
Open up.

33:47.450 --> 33:49.823
- Your cock is mine.
- Uh-huh.

33:49.825 --> 33:51.781
- Your cum is mine.
- Uh-huh.

33:51.783 --> 33:53.740
- You are mine.
- Uh-huh.

33:53.742 --> 33:56.992
Your money is mine.

34:04.742 --> 34:06.240
Jack?

34:06.242 --> 34:07.615
Jack,
give me all that cum.

34:07.617 --> 34:09.156
- It's my cum.
- Fuck.

34:09.158 --> 34:11.323
- Yeah.
- It's my fucking cum.

34:11.325 --> 34:12.365
Yeah.

34:12.367 --> 34:14.323
Cum for me, Jackie.

34:23.408 --> 34:25.450
What the fuck are
you doing in my room?

34:28.117 --> 34:30.367
Hey, could I borrow
your copy of Ulysses?

34:31.575 --> 34:34.365
No, I'm right in
the middle of that.

34:34.367 --> 34:35.700
Believe it or not, so am I.

34:39.617 --> 34:40.823
It's getting kind of late.

34:40.825 --> 34:43.281
I think I should
probably get going.

34:43.283 --> 34:46.033
You're gonna make me
finish this bottle by myself?

34:52.783 --> 34:54.283
You're so tense.

34:55.367 --> 34:56.490
Can't be good for you

34:56.492 --> 34:59.073
to be staring at your computer
all day long gambling.

34:59.075 --> 35:00.698
Yeah, probably not.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.158
Definitely not.

35:03.408 --> 35:04.615
Hey, you know what?

35:04.617 --> 35:06.156
You should go to one of
my classes some time.

35:06.158 --> 35:07.281
Yeah, I don't think so.

35:07.283 --> 35:09.531
You know, yoga's
not really my thing.

35:14.450 --> 35:16.240
Who is that, Larry?

35:16.242 --> 35:17.323
Listen, Emma, I'm sorry.

35:17.325 --> 35:18.406
I really have to go.

35:18.408 --> 35:19.865
Well, who is it?

35:19.867 --> 35:20.742
Come on!

35:22.450 --> 35:24.531
I don't wanna let you
sneak out of this.

35:26.242 --> 35:26.906
Yeah, I'm sorry.

35:26.908 --> 35:27.823
I gotta take this.

35:27.825 --> 35:29.323
Sorry.

35:29.325 --> 35:30.200
Hello?

35:32.325 --> 35:33.740
No, not at all.

35:33.742 --> 35:34.742
Who is it?

35:37.908 --> 35:39.531
What do you wanna show me?

35:39.533 --> 35:40.740
Who is it?

35:40.742 --> 35:41.575
Who is it?

35:42.492 --> 35:43.492
No.

35:45.742 --> 35:46.575
Who is it?

35:57.950 --> 36:00.742
So what is this that
you wanna show me?

36:02.242 --> 36:04.240
Okay, I haven't
shown anyone yet, okay?

36:04.242 --> 36:05.281
You're the first person.

36:05.283 --> 36:06.656
Oh, I'm the first?

36:06.658 --> 36:07.865
- Wow.
- Okay, that's an honor.

36:07.867 --> 36:10.700
It's an honor that I
am bestowing upon you.

36:12.658 --> 36:13.783
Can you see it?

36:15.492 --> 36:17.698
Oh my God, whoa!

36:17.700 --> 36:19.240
That's fucking incredible.

36:19.242 --> 36:20.615
I want
your honest opinion.

36:20.617 --> 36:21.490
Oh my, yes.

36:21.492 --> 36:23.240
Move it in closer.

36:23.242 --> 36:24.408
I wanna see it close.

36:25.367 --> 36:27.198
Oh shit.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.906
I love this view.

36:29.908 --> 36:32.323
Damn, there's like whole worlds

36:32.325 --> 36:34.240
inside all those little details.

36:34.242 --> 36:35.490
Okay, slow down.

36:35.492 --> 36:37.531
No, really, this
is so fucking good.

36:37.533 --> 36:38.490
It's amazing.

36:38.492 --> 36:39.656
And I'm not just saying that

36:39.658 --> 36:40.823
because I wanna
get in your pants.

36:40.825 --> 36:42.656
You totally wanna
get in my pants.

36:42.658 --> 36:44.323
I mean, maybe yes,

36:44.325 --> 36:45.531
but this is...

36:45.533 --> 36:47.781
You wanna get in
my pants so bad.

36:47.783 --> 36:48.948
No, I'm serious!

36:48.950 --> 36:50.198
I don't believe
a word you say!

36:50.200 --> 36:51.656
What?

36:51.658 --> 36:52.573
It's like one of the best
paintings I've ever seen.

36:52.575 --> 36:53.781
This could totally be on one

36:53.783 --> 36:56.406
of the walls at
the fucking MoMA.

36:56.408 --> 36:57.906
Yeah, okay, sure.

36:57.908 --> 36:59.615
- You're crazy.
- I'm serious right now.

36:59.617 --> 37:01.531
You're lying.

37:01.533 --> 37:02.533
Oh my God.

37:04.617 --> 37:06.323
I love it.

37:06.325 --> 37:06.990
Thanks.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.698
That's amazing.

37:08.700 --> 37:10.490
You say everything
I do is amazing.

37:10.492 --> 37:12.698
I don't even know if
you're being real or not.

37:12.700 --> 37:14.825
- Okay, sure.
- No, I'm being totally real.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.531
Hey, can I show you a painting?

37:17.533 --> 37:18.865
Okay.

37:18.867 --> 37:21.698
I didn't do this but it's
definitely my favorite.

37:21.700 --> 37:22.575
What do you think?

37:23.950 --> 37:25.948
I think she's naked.

37:25.950 --> 37:28.323
I think she looks
exactly like you.

37:28.325 --> 37:30.531
What are
you listening to?

37:30.533 --> 37:31.365
Beethoven.

37:31.367 --> 37:32.406
You like it?

37:32.408 --> 37:33.615
Yeah, I guess.

37:33.617 --> 37:36.367
I'm not really familiar
with any of his songs.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.533
What kind of stuff
do you listen to?

37:40.575 --> 37:42.323
Stuff from the past century?

37:42.325 --> 37:43.656
I don't know.

37:43.658 --> 37:46.281
This recording was
done in the past century.

37:46.283 --> 37:47.031
Okay, whatever.

37:47.033 --> 37:48.325
I don't listen to Beethoven.

37:50.533 --> 37:51.365
Do you like it?

37:51.367 --> 37:52.573
That's pretty good!

37:52.575 --> 37:53.990
Yeah, I'm on a roll today.

37:53.992 --> 37:54.906
It's my second one.

37:54.908 --> 37:57.573
Scarlet, do you mind
if I introduce you

37:57.575 --> 37:59.740
to my friends Will and Larry?

37:59.742 --> 38:00.865
They're right here.

38:00.867 --> 38:02.365
Here, just say hi real quick.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.283
Hey, Scarlet!

38:05.617 --> 38:07.698
When I talk to you,
I sort of feel intimidated

38:07.700 --> 38:09.448
because I feel like you're like,

38:09.450 --> 38:11.492
the coolest person
I've ever met.

38:13.033 --> 38:16.031
I am
so far from cool.

38:16.033 --> 38:17.742
So how'd you
start being a dom?

38:18.992 --> 38:22.906
I was into before
I can even remember.

38:22.908 --> 38:24.323
Yeah, when I was little,

38:24.325 --> 38:25.906
I would always choose like,

38:25.908 --> 38:27.740
the weakest boy in the class,

38:27.742 --> 38:30.073
like the one that got
picked on the most,

38:30.075 --> 38:32.906
and I would request
play dates with him,

38:32.908 --> 38:35.367
and I would just torture him.

38:36.617 --> 38:38.740
Yeah.

38:38.742 --> 38:42.781
I used to make this one
boy pretend to be a pony.

38:42.783 --> 38:43.700
Show me again?

38:45.950 --> 38:47.365
It's incredible.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.740
I love the way you
use the yellow.

38:48.742 --> 38:49.617
Yeah.

38:50.950 --> 38:53.990
I wanted to switch it up a
little bit and try something new.

38:53.992 --> 38:58.408
Hey, so let's
play a little game.

39:01.533 --> 39:02.406
I don't like games.

39:02.408 --> 39:03.867
What kind of game?

39:05.575 --> 39:07.781
I know you live
in New York City.

39:07.783 --> 39:09.656
I do not live in New York.

39:09.658 --> 39:10.823
I've never been there.

39:10.825 --> 39:11.990
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:11.992 --> 39:12.865
No, I saw you the other night.

39:12.867 --> 39:14.115
You did not see me.

39:14.117 --> 39:15.615
- You saw my doppelganger.
- I did, I did,

39:15.617 --> 39:16.492
and I'm not mad.

39:17.492 --> 39:18.531
I'm mad!

39:18.533 --> 39:19.698
I get it!

39:19.700 --> 39:20.948
I get your need
to keep your work

39:20.950 --> 39:22.617
and your private life separate.

39:23.992 --> 39:26.575
What would you say if I had
a picture of you in New York?

39:27.783 --> 39:29.031
I wanna see it.

39:29.033 --> 39:33.448
What would you say if I had
a picture of you in New York?

39:33.450 --> 39:36.490
I'd say, wow, you're
really great at Photoshop.

39:36.492 --> 39:37.990
Okay, here's the deal.

39:37.992 --> 39:42.992
If I get evidence, like a
picture or a video of you here,

39:44.117 --> 39:45.117
you have to go on a
trip with me to Paris.

39:46.825 --> 39:48.615
I can't just pick up
and go to Paris with you.

39:48.617 --> 39:49.990
Why not?

39:49.992 --> 39:51.406
- Yeah, of course you can.
- That's crazy.

39:51.408 --> 39:52.573
- No, you're crazy.
- Of course you can.

39:52.575 --> 39:53.823
No, think about
it, think about it!

39:53.825 --> 39:54.823
We could have the
best time ever.

39:54.825 --> 39:57.073
We could go see all
the greatest museums,

39:57.075 --> 39:59.406
see the best paintings
known to man.

39:59.408 --> 40:00.490
We could drink wine

40:00.492 --> 40:01.781
by the sand,

40:01.783 --> 40:04.992
we could listen to
beautiful music, make love.

40:06.700 --> 40:07.908
- Come on!
- Okay.

40:08.825 --> 40:10.531
That all sounds wonderful,

40:10.533 --> 40:13.698
but you're never gonna
get a picture of me.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.698
- I don't live in New York.
- Oh.

40:15.700 --> 40:17.531
- I'm sorry, I wish I did.
- Oh, game is on.

40:17.533 --> 40:18.698
Game is on, girl.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.490
Game is on.

40:29.783 --> 40:31.615
Well, what are you
ding-dongs doing here?

40:31.617 --> 40:33.867
Got a business
proposition for you.

40:36.867 --> 40:38.906
My son's tuition
is due in a week.

40:38.908 --> 40:42.031
In one week I gotta
come up with 25 grand.

40:42.033 --> 40:43.490
Listen, if we give
you money right now,

40:43.492 --> 40:45.073
can you win it back
for us in blackjack?

40:45.075 --> 40:47.573
I mean, you know all the
tricks and shit, right?

40:47.575 --> 40:50.865
Yeah, I could win,

40:50.867 --> 40:53.656
but I mean, if it's
your son's tuition,

40:53.658 --> 40:54.865
I could easily lose it.

40:54.867 --> 40:57.240
That's not even the most
sound financial plan.

40:57.242 --> 40:58.865
That's a risk he's
willing to take,

40:58.867 --> 41:00.490
but if you could win,

41:00.492 --> 41:02.198
then there's a little
kickback in it for.

41:02.200 --> 41:03.573
No, I
wouldn't be doing this

41:03.575 --> 41:05.906
as like a fucking moneymaker.

41:05.908 --> 41:06.823
- I'm just saying.
- I would do it to help,

41:06.825 --> 41:10.198
but all right, hold on.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.240
Let's talk real figures here.

41:11.242 --> 41:12.531
How much do you have?

41:12.533 --> 41:13.948
I got about a quarter
of what we need.

41:13.950 --> 41:15.948
- No, dude, I can't.
- Six, you have six.

41:15.950 --> 41:17.073
- A quarter?
- A quarter.

41:17.075 --> 41:18.073
It's risky
for me to play

41:18.075 --> 41:18.990
with anything less than half.

41:18.992 --> 41:19.865
He has six.

41:19.867 --> 41:20.781
How much do you need?

41:20.783 --> 41:22.698
Yeah, 'cause that's all I got.

41:22.700 --> 41:25.450
I got six solid, liquid.

41:27.700 --> 41:32.700
If I put in five,

41:33.825 --> 41:35.240
our pot would be 11,

41:35.242 --> 41:37.823
and then we can do
that in one hand.

41:37.825 --> 41:39.823
I could fucking double your
money in one fucking hand.

41:39.825 --> 41:40.990
You could do that,
man?

41:40.992 --> 41:42.615
Of course I can.

41:42.617 --> 41:43.948
You think I don't do it
like every fucking night?

41:43.950 --> 41:44.948
I mean, we could
put his whole 6,000

41:44.950 --> 41:46.115
on a fucking roulette.

41:46.117 --> 41:47.823
And if that's the case...

41:47.825 --> 41:49.240
No, I don't
wanna do that, man.

41:49.242 --> 41:50.781
None of this 50-50 shit.

41:50.783 --> 41:53.240
No, no, I can win it
in like, four hands.

41:53.242 --> 41:56.031
I need like, four solid hands.

41:56.033 --> 41:57.656
I'll tell you something.

41:57.658 --> 42:00.531
Like a week ago I don't think
I would be ready for this.

42:00.533 --> 42:01.117
But right now,

42:03.825 --> 42:05.698
I don't wanna jinx anything,

42:05.700 --> 42:07.906
but stars are really
aligning in my life,

42:07.908 --> 42:12.908
and I feel like now
is the perfect moment

42:13.617 --> 42:15.906
to capitalize

42:15.908 --> 42:18.156
but not in a capitalistic way.

42:18.158 --> 42:20.573
Look, I'll pay you
back every single penny.

42:20.575 --> 42:21.740
You don't have to
worry about that.

42:21.742 --> 42:22.990
This is all for your
fucking son, okay?

42:22.992 --> 42:23.823
Man.

42:23.825 --> 42:25.158
But okay.

42:26.700 --> 42:27.990
Let's chill.

42:27.992 --> 42:29.198
Let's pretend this
conversation didn't happen

42:29.200 --> 42:31.281
for like five minutes

42:31.283 --> 42:33.656
and then we'll revisit the idea.

42:33.658 --> 42:34.615
Cool?

42:34.617 --> 42:35.492
Good idea.

42:36.450 --> 42:37.823
- Push.
- This is how it goes.

42:37.825 --> 42:38.990
Yeah, you have to
win two to lose.

42:38.992 --> 42:40.281
Yeah, but there's
a lot of push

42:40.283 --> 42:41.823
on this fucking machine, bro.

42:41.825 --> 42:42.698
I know, it's okay.

42:42.700 --> 42:43.656
Here, here, here.

42:43.658 --> 42:45.656
This is where we make up for it.

42:45.658 --> 42:46.865
- Push.
- Fuck!

42:46.867 --> 42:47.740
What did I just say?

42:47.742 --> 42:48.948
I know, I know.

42:48.950 --> 42:49.781
You don't
say shit like that.

42:49.783 --> 42:51.031
It puts it in the ether.

42:51.033 --> 42:51.781
You know, they listen
to you, you know?

42:51.783 --> 42:52.948
Don't.

42:52.950 --> 42:54.198
Dude, man, you're
up like $1,100.

42:54.200 --> 42:55.323
Yeah, I know, but I'm
gonna lose right now.

42:55.325 --> 42:57.115
So watch me, I'm
gonna do a small one.

42:57.117 --> 42:58.198
Don't say that, man.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.031
No, it's not a bad thing.

42:59.033 --> 43:00.240
Oh, you're going down.

43:00.242 --> 43:02.781
I just feel that
this one is not it.

43:02.783 --> 43:03.740
Take it anyways, man.

43:03.742 --> 43:04.781
Just take it.

43:04.783 --> 43:05.865
Like, I don't know.

43:05.867 --> 43:07.240
I wouldn't be surprised
if they get 20.

43:07.242 --> 43:08.823
- Dealer busts.
- Oh, okay, that's fine.

43:08.825 --> 43:10.156
- I don't know, bud.
- We're on a good streak.

43:10.158 --> 43:12.781
So I'm gonna take
advantage of that.

43:12.783 --> 43:14.033
101 Dalmatians.

43:16.367 --> 43:18.156
Dealer busts.

43:18.158 --> 43:19.323
That's what I'm talking about!

43:19.325 --> 43:21.198
Don't fucking
let me bet small,

43:21.200 --> 43:22.740
because when I go small,

43:22.742 --> 43:24.158
I go fucking yeah!

43:25.283 --> 43:26.740
- Let's go!
- Straight up, straight up!

43:26.742 --> 43:27.698
50s and 100s, man.

43:27.700 --> 43:28.865
Just fucking , man!

43:28.867 --> 43:29.781
That's why they call
me Blackjack Jack!

43:29.783 --> 43:30.656
Gotta go.

43:30.658 --> 43:31.865
I gotta roll.

43:31.867 --> 43:32.823
- Oh, shit!
- Player busts.

43:32.825 --> 43:33.906
Damn it!

43:33.908 --> 43:35.240
Hey, man, you should...

43:35.242 --> 43:38.031
No, quiet,
quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.

43:38.033 --> 43:40.031
Henry, hey.

43:40.033 --> 43:42.406
What the hell is
going on down here?

43:42.408 --> 43:43.406
- Henry...
- I'm sorry we've been

43:43.408 --> 43:45.156
a little bit too loud.

43:45.158 --> 43:47.365
Get in here,
man, smoke a bowl.

43:47.367 --> 43:48.823
I'm sorry that it's taken
me so long to get out of here.

43:48.825 --> 43:50.240
I'm gonna be out of
here in three days.

43:50.242 --> 43:51.781
And I figured out a way
to get all of these books

43:51.783 --> 43:52.948
and everything gone, all right?

43:52.950 --> 43:54.115
We're playing
some cards, Henry.

43:54.117 --> 43:55.323
Come on.

43:55.325 --> 43:57.781
We're doing one
hit, is that cool?

43:57.783 --> 43:59.781
This has got to be
the worst paint job

43:59.783 --> 44:00.948
I've ever seen in my life.

44:00.950 --> 44:02.781
It's just one coat, Henry.

44:02.783 --> 44:03.740
All right.

44:03.742 --> 44:04.906
Also, question for you.

44:04.908 --> 44:06.240
What made you decide
to go with this color?

44:06.242 --> 44:08.073
Because it's not typical.

44:08.075 --> 44:09.823
It's like Area
51 in here, man.

44:09.825 --> 44:11.073
There's a family moving in

44:11.075 --> 44:12.365
and the children like the color.

44:12.367 --> 44:13.823
- Really?
- Oh.

44:13.825 --> 44:14.948
What're you gonna do?

44:14.950 --> 44:16.198
Aliens.

44:16.200 --> 44:17.073
Henry, come on.

44:17.075 --> 44:18.115
Okay, see you, buddy.

44:18.117 --> 44:19.073
I'm sorry.

44:19.075 --> 44:20.781
Listen, I'm gonna keep
him under control, okay?

44:20.783 --> 44:21.781
Okay, I gotta get up
early in the morning,

44:21.783 --> 44:23.031
so try to keep it down?

44:23.033 --> 44:23.990
Oh, right, all right.

44:23.992 --> 44:25.156
Okay, sorry, sorry.

44:25.158 --> 44:26.617
All right, love you,
thank you, Henry.

44:30.825 --> 44:32.908
Yo, get me a beer, man.

44:34.908 --> 44:36.115
Hey, Jackie.

44:36.117 --> 44:37.823
So what's this big news
you have to tell me?

44:37.825 --> 44:39.700
Did you finally snap
a picture of me?

44:40.783 --> 44:43.323
Oh, well, it's not
really that big a deal.

44:43.325 --> 44:45.740
I just wanted to tell somebody.

44:45.742 --> 44:48.740
So you remember that guy
that you saw me with,

44:48.742 --> 44:49.865
the older one?

44:49.867 --> 44:51.323
Oh,
yeah, I remember him.

44:51.325 --> 44:52.617
Yeah, well,

44:53.825 --> 44:57.700
I'm gonna help him pay for his
son's first year of college.

44:59.075 --> 45:01.073
Oh God.

45:01.075 --> 45:02.323
I'm embarrassed to say this,

45:02.325 --> 45:06.033
but what the reason I
wanted to tell you is,

45:07.325 --> 45:11.365
you know how people say you
make me a better person,

45:11.367 --> 45:14.367
or my lover makes
me a better person?

45:16.033 --> 45:20.075
Well, I feel like I finally
get what that means now.

45:28.158 --> 45:30.906
Thinking about
quitting camming.

45:30.908 --> 45:33.115
What, really, you are?

45:33.117 --> 45:33.990
Yeah.

45:33.992 --> 45:35.033
Why?

45:36.825 --> 45:39.531
It was never really supposed
to be this longterm thing.

45:39.533 --> 45:41.865
It just kind of happened.

45:41.867 --> 45:43.031
Well, you know what
you should be doing

45:43.033 --> 45:43.908
is painting full-time.

45:46.033 --> 45:47.948
Is there a way we could
still keep in touch?

45:47.950 --> 45:49.323
Maybe.

45:49.325 --> 45:51.156
Are you gonna give me a
discount on the See Stream?

45:51.158 --> 45:52.281
God, yes!

45:52.283 --> 45:53.281
Of course!

45:53.283 --> 45:55.823
You're one of my beta testers.

45:55.825 --> 45:58.323
You know, either way,

45:58.325 --> 45:59.865
it totally doesn't matter,

45:59.867 --> 46:01.992
'cause soon enough we'll
both be on a plane to Paris.

46:04.492 --> 46:06.073
What was that?

46:06.075 --> 46:07.033
What was what?

46:08.283 --> 46:09.156
I heard something.

46:09.158 --> 46:10.240
I heard someone come in.

46:10.242 --> 46:12.031
Turn the camera over there.

46:12.033 --> 46:13.031
No.

46:13.033 --> 46:13.990
Like, no one is here.

46:13.992 --> 46:15.367
I'm the only person here, relax.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.031
Wait, why
are you lying to me?

46:18.033 --> 46:19.115
Turn the camera.

46:19.117 --> 46:20.073
I'm not fucking lying.

46:20.075 --> 46:21.281
I'm not turning the camera.

46:21.283 --> 46:22.240
Yeah, you are;

46:22.242 --> 46:23.365
I'm paying you right now!

46:23.367 --> 46:24.573
Don't forget the
meter's fucking running!

46:24.575 --> 46:25.990
Turn the camera!

46:25.992 --> 46:27.198
Oh, wow.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.075
Okay.

46:29.492 --> 46:30.906
You know what?

46:30.908 --> 46:32.073
I don't fucking need
this shit from you,

46:32.075 --> 46:34.156
so have a nice day, Jack.

46:34.158 --> 46:37.242
What do you want, Duke?

46:38.783 --> 46:40.492
Since when do you do
cam shows in our bedroom?

46:43.908 --> 46:45.992
So there's something
that I have to tell you.

46:50.867 --> 46:55.867
We've saved up enough and
we got the liquor license.

46:56.533 --> 46:57.948
That's so good!

46:57.950 --> 46:58.906
Duke's is
fully operational.

46:58.908 --> 46:59.865
Oh, you did it!

46:59.867 --> 47:01.323
The stage is ready for play.

47:01.325 --> 47:02.948
That's
incredible, babe.

47:02.950 --> 47:04.948
And it was a long
and arduous journey,

47:04.950 --> 47:07.367
but
now we're all set.

47:10.617 --> 47:13.115
Babe, what's the deal
with this Jack guy?

47:13.117 --> 47:14.158
He's loaded, right?

47:15.283 --> 47:16.281
He's like some
kind of Wall Street

47:16.283 --> 47:18.033
or Silicon Valley type of dude?

47:18.908 --> 47:20.240
I guess.

47:20.242 --> 47:22.158
He's clearly
fucking crazy for you.

47:23.492 --> 47:26.283
I bet you could ask him for
some extra funds.

47:28.450 --> 47:30.573
There's just gonna be all these
extra costs next few months.

47:30.575 --> 47:32.825
And I still gotta pay
the fucking PR guys.

47:33.867 --> 47:34.906
Oh, and they might get the Times

47:34.908 --> 47:36.490
- to come to our opening.
- No way?

47:36.492 --> 47:38.031
We might get the New York
fucking Times to come down.

47:38.033 --> 47:39.906
- You're kidding?
- I'm not kidding.

47:39.908 --> 47:40.573
I mean, it's not
written in stone yet.

47:40.575 --> 47:41.865
Babe, that's amazing!

47:41.867 --> 47:43.325
- I know!
- Oh my God.

47:44.325 --> 47:47.075
We just need a
little bit more.

47:48.200 --> 47:49.448
Yeah.

47:49.450 --> 47:52.908
Baby, do you remember what
we used to always talk about?

47:54.200 --> 47:56.950
I mean, the reason why I
wanted to open Duke's for you?

47:58.325 --> 48:01.990
We want me to create
from a place of love,

48:01.992 --> 48:03.492
not of resistance.

48:05.492 --> 48:06.948
And we do.

48:06.950 --> 48:09.408
I make us money so
you can do your thing.

48:15.200 --> 48:16.656
I love you so much.

48:16.658 --> 48:17.492
I know.

48:30.617 --> 48:31.867
- Hi.
- Hey.

48:32.533 --> 48:33.948
What's up?

48:33.950 --> 48:35.698
Just phone calls.

48:35.700 --> 48:38.198
Yeah, are you busy?

48:38.200 --> 48:39.615
Yeah.

48:39.617 --> 48:42.948
Did you have a chance to
read my notes on the script?

48:42.950 --> 48:46.406
No, I've been so busy.

48:46.408 --> 48:47.365
I haven't.

48:47.367 --> 48:48.990
I mean, just phone calls,

48:48.992 --> 48:50.365
and with the money
not being raised yet,

48:50.367 --> 48:53.156
we have to have something
set in stone now.

48:53.158 --> 48:54.365
I know,

48:54.367 --> 48:56.031
but you made it seem
like it was so urgent.

48:56.033 --> 48:56.990
I did it overnight.

48:56.992 --> 48:58.198
It was urgent,

48:58.200 --> 48:59.990
but like, we don't
have the money yet.

48:59.992 --> 49:01.531
And we can't keep changing
the scripts at this point.

49:01.533 --> 49:03.531
You know, as far
as investors and...

49:03.533 --> 49:05.073
- Uh-huh.
- You understand.

49:05.075 --> 49:06.573
Investors?

49:06.575 --> 49:07.450
You mean me?

49:08.700 --> 49:09.948
Okay, guys,
whenever you're ready.

49:09.950 --> 49:11.073
One more time.

49:11.075 --> 49:12.531
From the top?

49:12.533 --> 49:14.156
- Yes, please.
- All right.

49:14.158 --> 49:17.365
All I'm saying, it's
gonna be fucking terrific.

49:17.367 --> 49:18.615
It's better than terrific.

49:18.617 --> 49:21.073
It's gonna be
fucking unbelievable.

49:21.075 --> 49:23.031
When the theater space opens

49:23.033 --> 49:25.698
and you can quit talking
to these men and just...

49:25.700 --> 49:27.573
When?

49:27.575 --> 49:28.990
When you
finally get the money,

49:28.992 --> 49:29.990
and then you'll quit,

49:29.992 --> 49:31.573
and then we'll just be
working here together.

49:31.575 --> 49:33.490
I don't
think we're ever gonna have

49:33.492 --> 49:34.615
enough money for me to quit.

49:34.617 --> 49:35.740
We're almost there.

49:35.742 --> 49:36.698
Are you kidding me?

49:36.700 --> 49:37.573
What if I don't want to?

49:37.575 --> 49:38.740
That's the whole thing.

49:38.742 --> 49:40.281
That's what we're
talking about right now.

49:40.283 --> 49:41.531
That's
not what we talked about.

49:41.533 --> 49:44.615
I mean, you're
hurting me right now.

49:44.617 --> 49:46.031
I don't understand.

49:46.033 --> 49:47.573
Well, that's on you.

49:47.575 --> 49:49.073
If you're hurt, it's on you.

49:49.075 --> 49:50.615
But here's the thing,

49:50.617 --> 49:52.073
this is what we've
always worked towards.

49:52.075 --> 49:55.740
Would you rather be poor
and doing what you want,

49:55.742 --> 49:58.240
or be somebody's
fucking whore and rich?

49:58.242 --> 49:59.990
I really don't appreciate
it when you call me a whore.

49:59.992 --> 50:00.781
I'm not calling you a whore.

50:00.783 --> 50:02.115
I'm just saying...

50:02.117 --> 50:03.490
- Well, you just did!
- I mean, okay...

50:03.492 --> 50:05.073
You just called
me somebody's whore.

50:05.075 --> 50:08.031
Okay, look in a dictionary,

50:08.033 --> 50:10.115
and the definition
of a whore is someone

50:10.117 --> 50:12.198
who performs sexual
favors for money.

50:12.200 --> 50:13.490
- I
- don't feel like a whore.

50:13.492 --> 50:14.698
So by
definition, you're a whore.

50:14.700 --> 50:15.615
Are you calling me a whore?

50:15.617 --> 50:17.031
Do you think I'm a whore?

50:17.033 --> 50:18.323
No, I don't, but
well, yes, I do,

50:18.325 --> 50:19.740
because by definition,
you're a whore!

50:19.742 --> 50:20.698
Well, get over it.

50:20.700 --> 50:21.740
- Get over it.
- By definition,

50:21.742 --> 50:23.073
- you're a whore.
- Get over it.

50:23.075 --> 50:24.281
Get over it.

50:24.283 --> 50:25.406
Okay,
I mean, I love whores.

50:25.408 --> 50:27.031
I don't have anything
against whores.

50:27.033 --> 50:29.406
Oh, well, was
anyone gonna tell me

50:29.408 --> 50:31.450
that the fucking
play was about me?

50:32.825 --> 50:35.781
The play's not just about you.

50:35.783 --> 50:39.323
Well, you're fucking showcasing
all my personal business.

50:39.325 --> 50:40.531
It's fucking embarrassing.

50:40.533 --> 50:42.490
Look, this is still
just the rehearsal.

50:42.492 --> 50:43.781
We'll get there.

50:43.783 --> 50:45.365
You know, it's not gonna
be so autobiographical,

50:45.367 --> 50:49.698
but in order for the actors
to know where to take it,

50:49.700 --> 50:52.031
me and Sandra talked about
it and just felt like,

50:52.033 --> 50:53.740
you know, that the other
rehearsals were a little flat.

50:53.742 --> 50:55.490
Maybe if we used some of
the stuff from our life,

50:55.492 --> 50:58.656
it would make it have a
little bit more panache.

50:58.658 --> 51:00.490
Okay, and you didn't
think to tell me that?

51:00.492 --> 51:01.656
You didn't think that
that was important,

51:01.658 --> 51:03.490
that maybe I should
know that, right?

51:03.492 --> 51:04.658
I thought I told you.

51:06.158 --> 51:07.323
You know you didn't
fucking tell me!

51:07.325 --> 51:09.115
My whole thing is honesty.

51:09.117 --> 51:10.781
I mean, that's like
what I'm all about,

51:10.783 --> 51:12.281
and that's what this
was supposed to be.

51:12.283 --> 51:13.448
No.

51:13.450 --> 51:14.406
Maybe I'm too
honest sometimes.

51:14.408 --> 51:15.365
I get it, I get it, I get it.

51:15.367 --> 51:16.198
Maybe I'm too honest sometimes.

51:16.200 --> 51:17.198
And I'm sorry for that.

51:17.200 --> 51:18.700
You were honest at my expense.

51:20.700 --> 51:22.198
If it was at your
expense, it was equally mine.

51:22.200 --> 51:23.531
I feel like we share everything,

51:23.533 --> 51:26.865
so sure, sometimes whenever
I'm self-flagellating,

51:26.867 --> 51:28.448
you get part of the
collateral damage.

51:28.450 --> 51:29.656
And I'm sorry for that.

51:29.658 --> 51:30.823
I'm trying to be
better about that.

51:30.825 --> 51:32.573
But like, right
now where I'm at,

51:32.575 --> 51:34.156
yeah, you're in the play

51:34.158 --> 51:36.281
because you're what I think
about most of the day,

51:36.283 --> 51:38.698
and the idea that I would
not bring you in there

51:38.700 --> 51:41.281
seems fucking stupid.

51:41.283 --> 51:42.531
The play's personal.

51:42.533 --> 51:46.865
That felt so real
and uncomfortable.

51:46.867 --> 51:49.156
And I feel honestly like raped,

51:49.158 --> 51:51.615
or something of my own issues

51:51.617 --> 51:53.656
that I haven't even
come to terms with;

51:53.658 --> 51:56.323
to then just see them like
that, thrown in my face.

51:56.325 --> 51:57.531
Right.

51:57.533 --> 51:58.281
But isn't that like,
kind of a good thing,

51:58.283 --> 51:59.698
that you know...

51:59.700 --> 52:02.240
No, it's not a
fucking good thing!

52:02.242 --> 52:03.823
Okay, I just mean
in terms of like,

52:03.825 --> 52:06.323
we come to this space to
have reactions, good and bad,

52:06.325 --> 52:07.823
and so the fact that
you're seeing this on like,

52:07.825 --> 52:09.365
a really early rehearsal,

52:09.367 --> 52:10.656
you felt like visceral.

52:10.658 --> 52:12.448
I feel like in my mind,

52:12.450 --> 52:14.865
that's a sign that
we're onto something.

52:14.867 --> 52:16.323
No.

52:16.325 --> 52:18.198
- Duke?
- What?

52:18.200 --> 52:20.323
I just need to know if what
that fucking shitty actor

52:20.325 --> 52:22.115
was saying, was it true?

52:22.117 --> 52:23.198
Is that how you really feel?

52:23.200 --> 52:24.573
No.

52:24.575 --> 52:25.825
Mic check.

52:27.325 --> 52:28.325
Mic check.

52:29.450 --> 52:30.325
Mic check.

52:32.242 --> 52:34.740
Mic check.

52:34.742 --> 52:38.698
Mic check.

52:38.700 --> 52:41.490
Mic check.

52:41.492 --> 52:44.281
Mic check.

52:44.283 --> 52:46.406
Mic check.

53:26.575 --> 53:29.242
Keep your head still
and try not to blink.

53:31.408 --> 53:33.531
I want you to imagine
there's an invisible box

53:33.533 --> 53:34.948
around your head,

53:34.950 --> 53:36.823
and if you move your
head even just one inch,

53:36.825 --> 53:38.531
you will set off a trigger.

53:38.533 --> 53:39.740
What does the
trigger do?

53:39.742 --> 53:42.656
I feel like you're
not taking this seriously.

53:42.658 --> 53:43.656
Look at me.

53:43.658 --> 53:45.323
I am taking this seriously.

53:45.325 --> 53:46.906
For how much longer
do I have to do this?

53:46.908 --> 53:49.323
This is your punishment

53:49.325 --> 53:50.323
for logging off on me.

53:50.325 --> 53:52.698
You will do whatever I
tell you to do, okay?

53:52.700 --> 53:54.281
Okay.

53:54.283 --> 53:55.158
Look at me.

53:56.450 --> 53:57.325
Open your mouth.

54:00.533 --> 54:02.031
Stick out your tongue.

54:02.033 --> 54:03.365
Like that?

54:03.367 --> 54:04.450
Repeat after me,

54:05.783 --> 54:08.698
I have the sexiest body
that anybody's ever seen.

54:08.700 --> 54:12.325
I have the sexiest body
that anyone's ever seen.

54:13.533 --> 54:14.365
Yeah, that's good.

54:14.367 --> 54:15.533
That's a good girl.

54:18.367 --> 54:21.490
I have the hottest mouth that
can make any cock rock hard.

54:21.492 --> 54:22.448
Say that.

54:22.450 --> 54:23.656
I have the hottest mouth

54:23.658 --> 54:26.242
that could make
any cock rock hard.

54:26.992 --> 54:27.948
Say it again.

54:27.950 --> 54:29.865
I have the hottest fucking mouth

54:29.867 --> 54:32.448
that can make any
cock rock hard.

54:32.450 --> 54:34.365
I have the hottest
fucking mouth

54:34.367 --> 54:36.533
that could make
any cock rock hard.

54:38.450 --> 54:39.533
Take off your shirt.

54:40.825 --> 54:45.533
Take off your bra.

54:59.575 --> 55:00.408
Oh yeah.

55:02.367 --> 55:04.615
Oh my God, so fucking hot.

55:04.617 --> 55:06.823
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55:06.825 --> 55:08.450
Oh, fuck yeah.

55:11.617 --> 55:12.906
Oh my God, yeah.

55:12.908 --> 55:13.740
Taste yourself.

55:13.742 --> 55:15.031
Taste your fingers.

55:16.492 --> 55:17.742
Oh my God, yeah.

55:23.075 --> 55:24.365
Talk to me.

55:24.367 --> 55:25.531
Tell me you wanna fuck me.

55:25.533 --> 55:27.533
I wanna fuck
you so hard, baby.

55:28.617 --> 55:30.073
- I
- wanna fuck you too.

55:30.075 --> 55:31.406
Oh God, yeah.

55:52.658 --> 55:56.615
So this room
was my roommate's.

55:56.617 --> 55:58.948
Why is it so empty?

55:58.950 --> 55:59.950
Well, he's gone.

56:01.450 --> 56:03.073
Where'd he go?

56:03.075 --> 56:04.823
Oh, that is the
million dollar question.

56:04.825 --> 56:05.700
Nobody knows.

56:06.658 --> 56:08.656
What do
you mean nobody knows?

56:08.658 --> 56:10.365
He just disappeared?

56:10.367 --> 56:10.992
He's dead.

56:12.367 --> 56:13.823
Oh.

56:13.825 --> 56:14.658
Sorry.

56:15.825 --> 56:17.115
Sorry, my bad.

56:17.117 --> 56:18.573
It's all right.

56:18.575 --> 56:19.948
What happened?

56:19.950 --> 56:22.781
Well, one thing you
could say about Joe

56:22.783 --> 56:25.406
was that like, he
wasn't a hypocrite.

56:25.408 --> 56:27.115
He didn't just
talk about suicide.

56:27.117 --> 56:28.867
He actually did it.

56:29.783 --> 56:32.115
Damn, how'd he do it?

56:32.117 --> 56:33.031
Heroin.

56:33.033 --> 56:34.490
I forgot my keys one night

56:34.492 --> 56:35.656
and so I was like,
banging on the door

56:35.658 --> 56:36.656
to get him to let me in,

56:36.658 --> 56:37.948
and he wasn't answering,

56:37.950 --> 56:38.865
so I was just like,

56:38.867 --> 56:40.073
"Oh, shoot, what the fuck's up?"

56:40.075 --> 56:42.073
Has he like, got
his headphones on

56:42.075 --> 56:44.825
or must be just like, really
fucked up, like normal.

56:46.158 --> 56:47.865
I actually ended up breaking
in through the window,

56:47.867 --> 56:49.740
this one right here.

56:49.742 --> 56:51.698
And yeah, I found him
lying on the floor.

56:51.700 --> 56:53.825
He'd been dead for
almost like, three days.

56:54.992 --> 56:56.867
Oh my
God, I'm so sorry.

56:58.408 --> 56:59.742
He's not suffering anymore.

57:05.075 --> 57:07.448
30 minutes later though,

57:07.450 --> 57:10.531
I was at a massage
parlor getting a tug.

57:10.533 --> 57:11.948
You were not?

57:11.950 --> 57:13.156
Damn straight.

57:13.158 --> 57:14.367
Oh my God.

57:15.617 --> 57:17.656
You're such a perv.

57:17.658 --> 57:19.906
Yeah, you love it.

57:19.908 --> 57:22.867
Is that kind of when you
started getting into cam girls?

57:24.158 --> 57:27.615
No, I've been into
cam girls for a minute.

57:27.617 --> 57:29.073
Am I your favorite cam girl?

57:29.075 --> 57:31.450
Like God, you're my
favorite girl, period.

57:33.908 --> 57:37.908
So right before he
died, my roommate Joe,

57:40.742 --> 57:44.073
he told me something
that I haven't been able

57:44.075 --> 57:47.823
to get out of my system.

57:47.825 --> 57:49.698
It's this idea

57:49.700 --> 57:53.031
that he held very strongly.

57:53.033 --> 57:56.490
And basically, it's just
that like, we as humans,

57:56.492 --> 58:00.990
every relationship that
we're in is exploitative.

58:00.992 --> 58:03.948
And yes, I mean that
in a Marxist way,

58:03.950 --> 58:04.906
like with capital,

58:04.908 --> 58:08.156
but also just interpersonally.

58:08.158 --> 58:11.115
Like, nobody is in a
relationship with anyone,

58:11.117 --> 58:12.781
any relationship,

58:12.783 --> 58:17.783
even parent/child that isn't
based on a selfish gain.

58:18.742 --> 58:19.617
Just like,

58:20.950 --> 58:23.281
do you feel like you've
ever done something

58:23.283 --> 58:25.823
for somebody else
that wasn't partially

58:25.825 --> 58:27.117
to make yourself feel good?

58:32.950 --> 58:36.575
Well.

58:39.200 --> 58:40.615
We don't get this
money by Monday,

58:40.617 --> 58:42.031
the whole show will
have been for nothing.

58:42.033 --> 58:43.573
You know, all of our hard work?

58:43.575 --> 58:44.948
I thought Duke had his money?

58:44.950 --> 58:46.823
Not enough, apparently.

58:47.950 --> 58:49.281
It's cheap.

58:49.283 --> 58:50.117
I like that.

58:51.242 --> 58:52.450
Yeah, it's cheap.

58:53.283 --> 58:54.781
I mean, you could afford more.

58:54.783 --> 58:57.075
I mean, you make bank
on that site, right?

58:58.617 --> 59:00.823
You live in a space big
enough to hold a studio

59:00.825 --> 59:03.658
and a theater space and....

59:12.950 --> 59:13.865
Hey, Larry, what's up?

59:13.867 --> 59:15.281
Jackie-boy!

59:15.283 --> 59:16.698
You won't believe who
the fuck I just saw

59:16.700 --> 59:18.156
coming around the corner.

59:18.158 --> 59:19.281
Who?

59:19.283 --> 59:20.656
That broad from San Francisco,

59:20.658 --> 59:21.531
the cam girl.

59:21.533 --> 59:22.200
Wait, what?

59:23.158 --> 59:25.031
Are you fucking serious?

59:25.033 --> 59:27.156
Yeah,
I'm dead serious.

59:27.158 --> 59:28.156
Where are you?

59:28.158 --> 59:29.825
How much is she worth to you?

59:30.783 --> 59:33.740
You know what, I want $500.

59:33.742 --> 59:34.825
500?

59:35.950 --> 59:38.156
Matter of fact,
matter of fact, 600.

59:38.158 --> 59:39.823
Matter of fact, $600.

59:39.825 --> 59:40.698
Okay,
okay, that's fine.

59:40.700 --> 59:41.865
Where are you?

59:41.867 --> 59:43.781
I want 750
of your motherfucking,

59:43.783 --> 59:44.781
cock-sucking dollars,

59:44.783 --> 59:45.990
- how about that?
- Bro!

59:45.992 --> 59:47.365
How about
that, Jackie-boy?

59:47.367 --> 59:48.698
Bro, are you
fucking kidding me?

59:48.700 --> 59:50.281
I can't give you $750!

59:50.283 --> 59:52.031
I'm
fucking with you, bro.

59:52.033 --> 59:53.198
All right, look.

59:53.200 --> 59:54.698
I'm gonna trust you
on this, all right?

59:54.700 --> 59:55.698
Please, can
you do it right now?

59:55.700 --> 59:56.865
I got you.

59:56.867 --> 59:57.990
Bye.

59:57.992 --> 59:59.573
Fucking pussy stitch.

1:00:01.908 --> 1:00:02.783
Ooh.

1:00:18.242 --> 1:00:19.575
You here to see Duke?

1:00:21.242 --> 1:00:22.240
Yeah.

1:00:22.242 --> 1:00:23.742
He's upstairs.

1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:53.740
Have you seen
what he's up to lately?

1:02:53.742 --> 1:02:54.906
Fucking incredible.

1:02:54.908 --> 1:02:55.783
So far out.

1:02:57.992 --> 1:03:01.281
It's so fucking good.

1:03:01.283 --> 1:03:02.865
And this is the
big inaugural show.

1:03:02.867 --> 1:03:05.406
It has to be something special.

1:03:05.408 --> 1:03:06.781
I was thinking of getting like,

1:03:06.783 --> 1:03:08.408
the same letting guy
that did David's play.

1:03:09.533 --> 1:03:11.531
Have you seen that guy's shit?

1:03:11.533 --> 1:03:12.742
It's good.

1:03:17.908 --> 1:03:19.573
Oh, were you looking
at the book I got you?

1:03:19.575 --> 1:03:20.408
Yeah.

1:03:23.408 --> 1:03:25.198
It kind of looks like me, right?

1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:26.242
A little bit?

1:03:28.408 --> 1:03:29.242
No.

1:03:30.492 --> 1:03:31.406
What do you mean?

1:03:31.408 --> 1:03:32.408
This totally looks like me.

1:03:34.867 --> 1:03:35.865
Okay.

1:03:35.867 --> 1:03:36.990
You know,
I know that you meant

1:03:36.992 --> 1:03:38.281
what you said the other day.

1:03:38.283 --> 1:03:39.823
I didn't.

1:03:39.825 --> 1:03:42.156
I think you misinterpreted
what I was saying.

1:03:42.158 --> 1:03:43.323
No, I didn't.

1:03:43.325 --> 1:03:44.990
I know exactly what
you were saying.

1:03:44.992 --> 1:03:46.448
No, look.

1:03:46.450 --> 1:03:49.115
You know that I look up to you.

1:03:49.117 --> 1:03:50.117
Sure.

1:03:51.075 --> 1:03:54.367
I mean, I think
about you constantly.

1:03:55.492 --> 1:03:57.073
And do you wanna hear
something fucked up?

1:03:57.075 --> 1:03:58.448
What did you do?

1:03:58.450 --> 1:04:00.531
One day I kind
of let my curiosity get

1:04:00.533 --> 1:04:02.115
the best of me.

1:04:02.117 --> 1:04:04.448
And so I set up an account
and we had a session.

1:04:04.450 --> 1:04:05.906
You know, I said that
I didn't have a cam

1:04:05.908 --> 1:04:07.115
or microphone, but.

1:04:07.117 --> 1:04:08.615
I can't believe
you would do that.

1:04:08.617 --> 1:04:10.158
I'm glad I did it.

1:04:11.450 --> 1:04:13.115
- Look, fuck.
- Ugh, no.

1:04:13.117 --> 1:04:14.031
You were so fucking beautiful.

1:04:14.033 --> 1:04:15.490
What the fuck, Duke?

1:04:15.492 --> 1:04:17.365
How many times did you do this?

1:04:17.367 --> 1:04:18.573
I mean, I don't know.

1:04:18.575 --> 1:04:21.033
I used a different
account each time, but.

1:04:22.117 --> 1:04:23.115
That's so fucked up.

1:04:23.117 --> 1:04:24.115
You're wasting my time.

1:04:24.117 --> 1:04:25.281
I could be making money.

1:04:25.283 --> 1:04:26.450
Whose money did you use?

1:04:27.867 --> 1:04:29.242
I mean, it was
your money, but.

1:04:30.575 --> 1:04:33.531
Oh, so you used
my money to cam with me?

1:04:33.533 --> 1:04:35.323
I mean,
I used our money,

1:04:35.325 --> 1:04:36.906
and it just circled,

1:04:36.908 --> 1:04:40.115
but look, I mean, let's
go to the bedroom.

1:04:40.117 --> 1:04:41.615
I'm
mad at you, Duke.

1:04:41.617 --> 1:04:43.156
Don't be mad at me.

1:04:43.158 --> 1:04:44.073
I'm really mad.

1:04:44.075 --> 1:04:45.323
I know you are.

1:04:45.325 --> 1:04:46.158
Don't be.

1:04:47.325 --> 1:04:49.990
Did you
like it at least?

1:04:49.992 --> 1:04:51.990
I like it.

1:04:51.992 --> 1:04:55.323
I mean, it's fucking incredible.

1:04:55.325 --> 1:04:59.033
- I mean, you're incredible.
- Yeah?

1:05:03.325 --> 1:05:05.281
You know, if you weren't
such a jealous little bitch,

1:05:05.283 --> 1:05:08.031
then maybe I'd
fuck you right now.

1:05:08.033 --> 1:05:11.240
Oh, man,
my Lord of jealousy.

1:05:11.242 --> 1:05:13.198
For it is the green-eyed monster

1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:14.365
that doth mock...

1:05:14.367 --> 1:05:15.448
I really don't know

1:05:15.450 --> 1:05:17.323
what you're saying right now.

1:05:17.325 --> 1:05:18.656
And we had eyes

1:05:18.658 --> 1:05:22.575
and she chose me.

1:05:55.075 --> 1:05:57.156
Scarlet, hey, what's up?

1:05:57.158 --> 1:05:58.573
Hey, Jackie.

1:05:58.575 --> 1:06:00.492
Nothing, I was just
thinking about you.

1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:04.073
You were?

1:06:04.075 --> 1:06:05.281
Yeah, I
wanna come to New York.

1:06:05.283 --> 1:06:07.448
Can you fly me out
tomorrow morning?

1:06:07.450 --> 1:06:09.573
Are you
fucking kidding me?

1:06:09.575 --> 1:06:10.656
Why would
I be kidding you?

1:06:10.658 --> 1:06:11.617
I wanna come.

1:06:14.158 --> 1:06:15.033
Oh!

1:06:18.075 --> 1:06:18.950
Yeah.

1:06:22.033 --> 1:06:24.031
Well, you
don't seem very excited!

1:06:24.033 --> 1:06:25.198
No, no, no, no.

1:06:25.200 --> 1:06:26.198
I mean, I really
want you to come.

1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:28.031
It's just like...

1:06:28.033 --> 1:06:29.075
What's that?

1:06:30.283 --> 1:06:31.200
I have no idea.

1:06:32.450 --> 1:06:33.406
Fuck.

1:06:33.408 --> 1:06:34.281
It might be Will or Larry.

1:06:34.283 --> 1:06:35.531
Those guys are up early.

1:06:35.533 --> 1:06:39.615
Hold on, stay on the line.

1:06:39.617 --> 1:06:41.656
I just gotta take care of this.

1:06:43.075 --> 1:06:45.992
Oh my God, I wanna see
you so bad.

1:06:47.158 --> 1:06:49.117
Hold on, hold, hold.

1:06:52.992 --> 1:06:54.117
Hey, Jackie.

1:07:39.283 --> 1:07:41.408
So I'm guessing
this is Joe's room?

1:07:43.242 --> 1:07:44.117
Yeah.

1:07:45.158 --> 1:07:45.783
Thank you.

1:07:47.617 --> 1:07:52.490
Cheers.

1:07:52.492 --> 1:07:53.367
So,

1:07:57.533 --> 1:08:00.490
I guess you don't actually
live in San Francisco.

1:08:00.492 --> 1:08:01.698
Of course not.

1:08:01.700 --> 1:08:04.117
I've never even been
to San Francisco.

1:08:05.825 --> 1:08:07.700
Why don't you take
that picture of me?

1:08:09.117 --> 1:08:11.823
You said you wanted to
get a picture of me?

1:08:11.825 --> 1:08:12.823
Here.

1:08:12.825 --> 1:08:14.325
Make sure I look cute.

1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:17.281
Is this good?

1:08:17.283 --> 1:08:18.115
- This angle is good?
- Yeah.

1:08:18.117 --> 1:08:18.658
Okay.

1:08:20.408 --> 1:08:23.323
Oh my God.

1:08:23.325 --> 1:08:24.531
Well, so what are you gonna do?

1:08:24.533 --> 1:08:25.365
Where are you gonna go?

1:08:25.367 --> 1:08:26.448
What do you mean?

1:08:26.450 --> 1:08:27.617
I'm going to Paris.

1:08:31.117 --> 1:08:32.115
You are?

1:08:32.117 --> 1:08:32.781
With who?

1:08:32.783 --> 1:08:34.823
With you, silly.

1:08:34.825 --> 1:08:38.281
You said that if you took a
picture of me in New York,

1:08:38.283 --> 1:08:40.450
that you would take me to Paris.

1:08:41.825 --> 1:08:43.492
Oh my God, I did.

1:08:44.658 --> 1:08:46.698
Yeah.

1:08:46.700 --> 1:08:47.740
Are you not a man of your word?

1:08:47.742 --> 1:08:49.158
No, no, I am.

1:09:04.450 --> 1:09:08.531
Scarlet?

1:09:08.533 --> 1:09:09.658
Are you awake?

1:09:13.325 --> 1:09:14.200
Scarlet?

1:09:22.325 --> 1:09:23.200
Scarlet?

1:09:25.825 --> 1:09:27.448
Are you awake?

1:09:27.450 --> 1:09:29.117
Nuh-uh.

1:09:30.158 --> 1:09:33.406
Okay, yeah, me either,
I'm just checking.

1:09:33.408 --> 1:09:34.325
What time is it?

1:09:35.325 --> 1:09:36.448
Six.

1:09:36.450 --> 1:09:37.656
How'd you sleep?

1:09:37.658 --> 1:09:38.615
Not that great.

1:09:38.617 --> 1:09:39.823
Why?

1:09:39.825 --> 1:09:41.281
Because you woke
me up like 10 times.

1:09:41.283 --> 1:09:42.573
I'm sorry.

1:09:42.575 --> 1:09:44.283
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

1:09:46.783 --> 1:09:48.156
I don't know, I feel like
it's Christmas morning.

1:09:48.158 --> 1:09:50.448
- I can't sleep.
- Oh my God.

1:09:50.450 --> 1:09:51.450
How could I sleep?

1:09:52.492 --> 1:09:54.906
You know, I was thinking,

1:09:54.908 --> 1:09:56.490
so like, once we get to Paris,

1:09:56.492 --> 1:09:58.906
we could get like a
little temporary studio

1:09:58.908 --> 1:10:01.198
and we could set up a space
for you to do your painting.

1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:03.490
And I mean, we could
even have a place for you

1:10:03.492 --> 1:10:06.781
to do your cam work if you
wanted to continue doing that.

1:10:06.783 --> 1:10:11.783
Okay, I mean,
that sounds nice.

1:10:13.450 --> 1:10:15.823
What are you gonna
do about your job?

1:10:15.825 --> 1:10:17.198
My job?

1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:18.740
Oh, I can totally
do that online.

1:10:18.742 --> 1:10:21.365
Yeah, yeah, no, I can totally
continue my research online.

1:10:21.367 --> 1:10:22.825
Okay, okay, good.

1:10:25.658 --> 1:10:28.406
Wanna look at tickets?

1:10:28.408 --> 1:10:30.323
Yes!

1:10:30.325 --> 1:10:32.698
You know, we should
stop by your place,

1:10:32.700 --> 1:10:33.906
maybe on the way out.

1:10:33.908 --> 1:10:35.281
I feel like you're
gonna want more

1:10:35.283 --> 1:10:36.948
than what's in that
little suitcase, right?

1:10:36.950 --> 1:10:39.656
You're not gonna buy
me nice things in Paris?

1:10:39.658 --> 1:10:40.783
Oh, of course I am.

1:10:46.575 --> 1:10:47.990
You know what, I think
I'm just gonna be like you

1:10:47.992 --> 1:10:50.323
and like, just throw
out all my stuff.

1:10:50.325 --> 1:10:53.240
I really don't need
any of this shit.

1:10:53.242 --> 1:10:55.700
Like why do I even
have anything?

1:10:57.992 --> 1:10:59.615
Here's some chips.

1:10:59.617 --> 1:11:01.365
Here's some chips from 2005.

1:11:01.367 --> 1:11:04.740
Oh my God, you're
throwing everything away.

1:11:04.742 --> 1:11:05.906
Yeah, I
know, it's great.

1:11:05.908 --> 1:11:06.906
- I feel so fucking liberated.
- Yeah?

1:11:06.908 --> 1:11:07.823
Oh, look.

1:11:07.825 --> 1:11:08.700
This is great.

1:11:09.867 --> 1:11:14.365
I'm glad I kept a
whole collection of straws.

1:11:14.367 --> 1:11:18.906
This is for all the milkshakes
that I didn't make.

1:11:23.283 --> 1:11:24.073
You find anything?

1:11:24.075 --> 1:11:27.573
Uh-huh, 2:30 direct flight.

1:11:27.575 --> 1:11:29.365
Oh my God, incredible!

1:11:29.367 --> 1:11:30.281
Yeah.

1:11:30.283 --> 1:11:31.406
Let me give you my debit card.

1:11:31.408 --> 1:11:32.073
No, that's okay.

1:11:32.075 --> 1:11:33.365
It's my treat, babe.

1:11:33.367 --> 1:11:34.283
- No.
- Yeah.

1:11:35.575 --> 1:11:36.740
Okay, so listen,

1:11:36.742 --> 1:11:38.073
why don't you just
finish up here.

1:11:38.075 --> 1:11:38.906
Okay.

1:11:38.908 --> 1:11:39.906
And I'll wait outside.

1:11:39.908 --> 1:11:41.031
Just need to get some air.

1:11:41.033 --> 1:11:42.073
- Okay.
- Sure, thank you.

1:11:42.075 --> 1:11:43.490
Of course, of course, boo.

1:11:43.492 --> 1:11:44.575
I'll see you.

1:11:47.033 --> 1:11:48.698
Wait, let me
little run with you.

1:11:48.700 --> 1:11:50.573
I wanna go to an ATM
around the corner.

1:11:50.575 --> 1:11:52.073
I feel it'd be good to have
some cash for the airport.

1:11:52.075 --> 1:11:53.031
Okay.

1:11:53.033 --> 1:11:54.325
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1:11:58.367 --> 1:12:01.656
I just have one really
important question for you.

1:12:01.658 --> 1:12:04.365
So, do you think we
should make love here

1:12:04.367 --> 1:12:05.990
or wait until we land in Paris?

1:12:05.992 --> 1:12:08.656
Because I can totally
see the pros and cons

1:12:08.658 --> 1:12:09.865
of either situation.

1:12:09.867 --> 1:12:12.323
It's like, it could
be really fun to wait,

1:12:12.325 --> 1:12:15.617
but at the same time, like,
why wait at all, you know?

1:12:16.950 --> 1:12:18.698
Actually I think we should
just get back in there

1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:19.865
and get to it.

1:12:19.867 --> 1:12:21.573
What do you think?

1:12:21.575 --> 1:12:22.948
No, no, no, insufficient funds?

1:12:22.950 --> 1:12:24.781
What the?

1:12:26.075 --> 1:12:27.490
- No, no, no, no!
- Yeah, that's what you get,

1:12:27.492 --> 1:12:29.531
- you fucking pervert!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:12:29.533 --> 1:12:31.490
Open up!

1:12:45.367 --> 1:12:46.531
Ah!

1:12:46.533 --> 1:12:50.906
Whoa, that
was fucking wild!

1:12:50.908 --> 1:12:52.115
Baby, you did the right thing.

1:12:52.117 --> 1:12:54.325
You handled that like
such a professional.

1:12:55.492 --> 1:12:56.698
I mean, how'd you get
on his private cams?

1:12:56.700 --> 1:12:58.825
Did you have to log in
front of him or what?

1:13:00.867 --> 1:13:01.825
I mean, wow.

1:13:02.825 --> 1:13:05.115
You did such a great job.

1:13:05.117 --> 1:13:06.325
I'm so proud of you.

1:13:07.950 --> 1:13:08.825
That was not easy.

1:13:12.867 --> 1:13:15.448
Did you have to
have sex with him?

1:13:15.450 --> 1:13:16.325
No.

1:13:18.450 --> 1:13:19.698
Woo!

1:13:19.700 --> 1:13:20.992
All right, fuck.

1:13:22.992 --> 1:13:24.156
Woo!

1:13:24.158 --> 1:13:25.448
Fuck.

1:13:25.450 --> 1:13:26.325
Fuck.

1:13:27.075 --> 1:13:27.950
Fuck!

1:13:29.158 --> 1:13:30.698
Sir, I don't see
an issue with the account.

1:13:30.700 --> 1:13:31.906
No, I'm looking
at it right now.

1:13:31.908 --> 1:13:35.031
February the 28th, $10,000.

1:13:35.033 --> 1:13:36.156
That's a cam girl site.

1:13:36.158 --> 1:13:38.031
Do you know what that is?

1:13:38.033 --> 1:13:39.073
I can guess.

1:13:39.075 --> 1:13:40.448
Well, I'll tell you,

1:13:40.450 --> 1:13:42.865
it's humanly impossible
to spend that much.

1:13:42.867 --> 1:13:44.906
I am seeing
previous verified charges

1:13:44.908 --> 1:13:46.490
on the site.

1:13:46.492 --> 1:13:47.740
No, it doesn't matter
what I've done in the past.

1:13:47.742 --> 1:13:49.198
I'm talking about this charge.

1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:50.031
That's a fraudulent charge.

1:13:50.033 --> 1:13:51.698
I need that taken away.

1:13:51.700 --> 1:13:52.865
I'm sorry, sir,

1:13:52.867 --> 1:13:53.865
but I can't take
that charge away.

1:13:53.867 --> 1:13:55.448
What do you mean you
can't take it away?

1:13:55.450 --> 1:13:56.656
I'm asking you to
do your fucking job

1:13:56.658 --> 1:13:58.156
and remove a charge
that I didn't make.

1:13:58.158 --> 1:13:59.615
Sir, I
cannot take it away.

1:13:59.617 --> 1:14:01.033
But I didn't make the charge!

1:14:02.158 --> 1:14:03.365
That's a crime against me.

1:14:03.367 --> 1:14:07.656
Sir, I see that you
okayed charges to that site

1:14:07.658 --> 1:14:10.906
on the 27th, the 26th, the 25th,

1:14:10.908 --> 1:14:13.615
the 24th, the 23rd, the 22nd...

1:14:49.783 --> 1:14:51.573
Give me the news, man.

1:14:51.575 --> 1:14:53.698
Tell me, tell me,
tell me, how we doing?

1:14:57.158 --> 1:14:58.573
Hey man, can you
speak up a little bit?

1:14:58.575 --> 1:15:00.073
I can barely hear you.

1:15:00.075 --> 1:15:01.656
Dude, I lost it.

1:15:01.658 --> 1:15:04.698
We lost it.

1:15:04.700 --> 1:15:05.823
What do you mean you lost it?

1:15:05.825 --> 1:15:07.823
What do you mean?

1:15:07.825 --> 1:15:08.781
You lost it all?

1:15:08.783 --> 1:15:09.948
I thought we were
gonna talk about this

1:15:09.950 --> 1:15:10.950
before you did that?

1:15:11.825 --> 1:15:12.950
Yeah, I know.

1:15:17.283 --> 1:15:18.450
Well, what's left?

1:15:20.908 --> 1:15:23.700
I mean,
there's nothing.

1:15:24.617 --> 1:15:25.825
There's nothing left?

1:15:43.992 --> 1:15:48.992
Fuck!

1:16:03.575 --> 1:16:04.242
Hey, Joe.

1:17:05.117 --> 1:17:07.950
Oh, I'm such a fucking idiot!

1:17:09.075 --> 1:17:09.908
Oh.

1:17:11.408 --> 1:17:12.948
So fucking dumb.

1:17:12.950 --> 1:17:14.740
I'm such a fucking idiot!

1:17:14.742 --> 1:17:17.990
How the fuck did I
let you do this to me?

1:17:17.992 --> 1:17:19.158
Where's that money?

1:17:20.783 --> 1:17:21.700
Where's the money?

1:17:24.075 --> 1:17:25.575
It's gone, Jack.

1:17:27.325 --> 1:17:28.740
Well, then get outta here.

1:17:28.742 --> 1:17:30.698
No, I don't want to.

1:17:30.700 --> 1:17:32.073
No, I said get
the fuck outta here.

1:17:32.075 --> 1:17:33.615
I don't want to.

1:17:33.617 --> 1:17:34.615
- Please don't make me.
- Get the fuck outta here!

1:17:34.617 --> 1:17:35.698
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Please don't make me.

1:17:35.700 --> 1:17:36.323
Do you hear me?

1:17:36.325 --> 1:17:36.948
Get the fuck outta here!

1:17:36.950 --> 1:17:38.073
Get up!

1:17:38.075 --> 1:17:39.240
I can help you
get some of it back.

1:17:39.242 --> 1:17:40.698
No, no, I don't
need some of it back!

1:17:40.700 --> 1:17:41.865
I need all of it.

1:17:41.867 --> 1:17:43.865
Are you gonna get me
that money back or what?

1:17:43.867 --> 1:17:44.742
Hello?

1:17:47.283 --> 1:17:48.240
What are you doing?

1:17:48.242 --> 1:17:49.783
Get up, get the fuck outta here!

1:17:50.867 --> 1:17:53.742
Jack.

1:17:55.450 --> 1:17:56.406
Please.

1:17:56.408 --> 1:17:57.783
You told me you were rich.

1:18:02.783 --> 1:18:03.867
I'm not rich.

1:18:08.117 --> 1:18:11.283
What about See Stream
and the investors?

1:18:12.367 --> 1:18:13.617
I made that up.

1:18:16.867 --> 1:18:19.075
You believed me about that?

1:18:20.825 --> 1:18:22.908
You thought I had
people working for me?

1:18:24.367 --> 1:18:25.990
That's so dumb.

1:18:25.992 --> 1:18:27.406
You said that, Jack!

1:18:27.408 --> 1:18:28.698
I wanted you to like me,

1:18:28.700 --> 1:18:30.992
so I told you I had a good job!

1:18:32.117 --> 1:18:33.323
Okay, well, you lied,

1:18:33.325 --> 1:18:34.698
and this is why you're
in this predicament.

1:18:34.700 --> 1:18:36.156
No, I'm in this predicament

1:18:36.158 --> 1:18:38.031
because you and your
boyfriend stole money from me!

1:18:38.033 --> 1:18:40.906
Not to mention, you
broke into my house.

1:18:40.908 --> 1:18:42.073
I didn't break
into your house.

1:18:42.075 --> 1:18:43.281
You're also a stalker.

1:18:43.283 --> 1:18:44.198
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1:18:44.200 --> 1:18:44.823
I didn't break into your house.

1:18:44.825 --> 1:18:45.367
Jack.

1:18:47.158 --> 1:18:49.073
You broke into my house

1:18:49.075 --> 1:18:51.781
and you checked your fucking
emails on my computer.

1:18:51.783 --> 1:18:53.698
Like, who the fuck does that?

1:18:53.700 --> 1:18:55.906
Who goes to someone's house,

1:18:55.908 --> 1:18:57.156
breaks in,

1:18:57.158 --> 1:18:58.490
and then checks their email?

1:18:58.492 --> 1:19:00.033
Like, what were you thinking?

1:19:00.992 --> 1:19:02.281
Oops.

1:19:02.283 --> 1:19:03.990
Yeah, oops is right.

1:19:03.992 --> 1:19:05.365
You're fucking deranged.

1:19:05.367 --> 1:19:07.073
Actually, I'm gonna
call the police right now.

1:19:08.075 --> 1:19:09.365
Oh, you think that's funny?

1:19:09.367 --> 1:19:10.781
I'm gonna get the cop...

1:19:10.783 --> 1:19:11.948
You're not
gonna call anybody.

1:19:11.950 --> 1:19:13.323
- Oh, absolutely.
- No, you're not.

1:19:13.325 --> 1:19:15.865
I'm gonna get a
uniformed officer down here.

1:19:15.867 --> 1:19:17.073
- Oh, yes!
- And they're

1:19:17.075 --> 1:19:18.781
- gonna arrest you.
- Sexy uniform!

1:19:18.783 --> 1:19:19.823
- Call 'em.
- Yeah!

1:19:19.825 --> 1:19:20.823
Yeah, let's get 'em over here.

1:19:20.825 --> 1:19:21.823
Yeah, let me do it.

1:19:21.825 --> 1:19:23.031
- Let me do that.
- Call the boys.

1:19:23.033 --> 1:19:23.865
- What is it again?
- Yeah, call 'em.

1:19:23.867 --> 1:19:25.198
Is it still 911?

1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:27.406
Let's see.

1:19:27.408 --> 1:19:30.031
- I'm gonna do it.
- Okay, do it.

1:19:30.033 --> 1:19:33.323
Oh my God, I can't
wait for you to do it.

1:19:33.325 --> 1:19:34.448
Yeah.

1:19:34.450 --> 1:19:35.865
You better really
start begging.

1:19:35.867 --> 1:19:36.823
You might not like
the outcome though.

1:19:36.825 --> 1:19:37.490
You might not like the outcome.

1:19:37.492 --> 1:19:38.406
Oh, really?

1:19:38.408 --> 1:19:39.365
I might not like the outcome?

1:19:39.367 --> 1:19:40.615
Yeah, you might not like it.

1:19:40.617 --> 1:19:44.031
I actually think I am gonna
love seeing you in handcuffs.

1:19:44.033 --> 1:19:47.075
Jack, the only person that's
gonna be in handcuffs is you.

1:19:49.242 --> 1:19:50.990
What's your real name?

1:19:50.992 --> 1:19:52.948
I know it's not Scarlet.

1:19:52.950 --> 1:19:54.075
It is Scarlet.

1:19:57.867 --> 1:19:59.908
I like Scarlet better
than my real name.

1:20:04.242 --> 1:20:06.115
Can we fuck?

1:20:07.533 --> 1:20:08.408
Just once?

1:20:11.533 --> 1:20:13.158
- Just once?
- Yeah.

1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:16.075
Okay.

1:20:20.408 --> 1:20:21.240
Okay.

1:20:21.242 --> 1:20:22.240
Are you gonna kiss me?

1:20:22.242 --> 1:20:23.406
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1:20:23.408 --> 1:20:28.408
Fuck.

1:20:31.367 --> 1:20:32.242
Oh, fuck.

1:20:34.825 --> 1:20:36.531
What's the matter, you got
whiskey dick or something?

1:20:36.533 --> 1:20:38.573
I don't know, I don't know
what's happening, I'm sorry.

1:20:38.575 --> 1:20:39.865
What am I gonna do with that?

1:20:39.867 --> 1:20:41.031
I'm sorry.

1:20:41.033 --> 1:20:41.658
Nuh-uh.

1:20:45.075 --> 1:20:47.823
I don't know what's going on.

1:20:47.825 --> 1:20:48.450
I'm sorry.

1:20:53.158 --> 1:20:54.325
All right, I have an idea.

1:21:04.283 --> 1:21:05.158
Nuh-uh.

1:21:10.492 --> 1:21:14.115
What?

1:21:14.117 --> 1:21:15.323
- No!
- What are you doing?

1:21:15.325 --> 1:21:17.367
It's not how the game works.

1:21:18.325 --> 1:21:19.200
Stay!

1:21:22.367 --> 1:21:23.990
Okay, so I want you to picture

1:21:23.992 --> 1:21:28.198
that there's an invisible
line from here to here,

1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:31.073
and you can't cross
it no matter what.

1:21:31.075 --> 1:21:32.323
And if you do,

1:21:32.325 --> 1:21:35.948
something really
bad's gonna happen.

1:21:35.950 --> 1:21:37.365
- Understood?
- Okay, yeah.

1:21:37.367 --> 1:21:38.950
Okay, don't move.

1:22:01.492 --> 1:22:03.450
Mind if I smoke, Jackie?

1:22:05.658 --> 1:22:09.198
I think this is
a no-smoking room.

1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:11.156
You really don't wanna
see smoke coming out

1:22:11.158 --> 1:22:15.906
of my big, beautiful
lips, Jackie?

1:22:15.908 --> 1:22:16.575
Yeah.

1:22:25.450 --> 1:22:26.325
Open up.

1:22:36.367 --> 1:22:38.198
Now, are you gonna be
a good little slave

1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:39.575
and get your cock hard for me?

1:22:40.533 --> 1:22:42.573
Gimme your hand.

1:22:44.658 --> 1:22:46.031
Now, stroke it.

1:22:47.283 --> 1:22:49.073
Yeah.

1:22:49.075 --> 1:22:53.156
Ooh.

1:22:58.158 --> 1:23:00.073
You're so close.

1:23:00.075 --> 1:23:01.198
May I spit in my hand?

1:23:01.200 --> 1:23:02.573
Uh-huh.

1:23:02.575 --> 1:23:04.698
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, fuck yeah.

1:23:04.700 --> 1:23:06.281
Yeah?

1:23:06.283 --> 1:23:10.575
Your cock is really
nice in person.

1:23:11.450 --> 1:23:12.406
Can you touch yourself for me?

1:23:12.408 --> 1:23:15.033
It's gonna cost you.

1:23:16.783 --> 1:23:17.700
I'll pay.

1:23:19.325 --> 1:23:22.200
Oh, yeah.

1:23:26.283 --> 1:23:30.950
Oh, fuck.

1:23:44.617 --> 1:23:46.073
Oh, fuck.

1:23:46.075 --> 1:23:47.115
Ah.

1:23:47.117 --> 1:23:47.992
Yeah.

1:23:48.742 --> 1:23:50.200
Oh, fuck yeah.

1:23:53.325 --> 1:23:54.200
Oh.

1:24:11.283 --> 1:24:13.240
Hey, this is Will,
you've reached my cell.

1:24:13.242 --> 1:24:15.281
Please leave me
your name and number

1:24:15.283 --> 1:24:17.656
and I will get back to
you as soon as possible.

1:24:17.658 --> 1:24:19.450
Hey, Will, it's me.

1:24:22.242 --> 1:24:25.115
So listen, man, we're
gonna get your son's money.

1:24:25.117 --> 1:24:26.073
I have a new plan.

1:24:26.075 --> 1:24:29.031
I'm with a friend of
mine and she's, yeah.

1:24:29.033 --> 1:24:29.698
She's great,

1:24:29.700 --> 1:24:31.115
and she's gonna help,

1:24:31.117 --> 1:24:32.448
and we might have
to wait a semester,

1:24:32.450 --> 1:24:34.365
but I swear we're gonna get it.

1:24:34.367 --> 1:24:35.325
Okay, yeah!

1:24:36.242 --> 1:24:37.365
Call me back!

1:24:37.367 --> 1:24:42.325
Bye.
