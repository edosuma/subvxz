00:00.638 --> 00:01.938
<i>Previously on Royal Pains...</i>

00:01.939 --> 00:04.041
- You let a billionaire
hospital trustee die

00:04.042 --> 00:05.545
To save some kid
off the street.

00:05.546 --> 00:07.383
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:07.384 --> 00:08.781
- This trip is gonna
get you back on your feet.

00:08.782 --> 00:10.790
- What trip?
- To the Hamptons.

00:10.791 --> 00:12.573
Is this an arranged marriage?
- Yes.

00:12.574 --> 00:14.199
- Do you want to marry him?

00:14.200 --> 00:15.787
- This is a very bad omen.

00:15.788 --> 00:17.968
- Where's your ring?
Dit's a bad sign.

00:17.969 --> 00:19.138
- Stop it.

00:19.139 --> 00:20.372
- It looks like
your family clinic

00:20.373 --> 00:23.568
Won't be up and running
until about 2015.

00:23.569 --> 00:24.870
- A new proposal.

00:24.871 --> 00:26.537
- You want hankmed
to run your clinic?

00:26.538 --> 00:28.633
- Dr. Emily peck.
- Are you sticking around?

00:28.634 --> 00:30.633
- I'm setting up my own
concierge practice here.

00:30.634 --> 00:32.268
What are you doing here?

00:32.269 --> 00:33.772
- I was called
to see a patient.

00:33.773 --> 00:35.908
- You snooze, you lose,
Dr. Lawson.

00:57.541 --> 00:59.041
- No sudden moves.

00:59.042 --> 01:00.775
This thing could flip on us.

01:00.776 --> 01:02.542
- It worked last night.

01:02.543 --> 01:05.343
You have impressive balance.

01:05.345 --> 01:08.113
- Well, I was highly motivated.

01:08.114 --> 01:10.446
- I think I owe you one.

01:10.447 --> 01:13.080
- Do you always keep score?

01:19.583 --> 01:20.782
- Thanks for nothing, doc.

01:20.783 --> 01:23.179
Now my nose
won't stop bleeding.

01:44.317 --> 01:46.649
- Wow.

01:46.650 --> 01:47.783
- Yeah.

01:47.784 --> 01:50.684
- Mm. Now that...

01:50.685 --> 01:52.852
Is what I call a bridal tea.

01:56.788 --> 02:02.523
- I...I really did it.

02:02.524 --> 02:03.556
- It's subtle.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.490
- Uh, as tattoos go.

02:05.491 --> 02:07.958
- Come on.
It's a teeny, tiny flower.

02:07.959 --> 02:09.658
Raj'll love it.

02:09.660 --> 02:13.161
I got the same, right?

02:13.162 --> 02:14.695
- Right.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.517
- You got to come.
Right now.

02:57.518 --> 02:58.651
- I'm kind of busy here.

02:58.652 --> 03:01.253
- No, this... this can't wait.

03:01.254 --> 03:03.487
The stripper stole my van,

03:03.488 --> 03:05.589
And I think I killed raj.

03:05.590 --> 03:06.623
- You led with the van?

03:06.624 --> 03:08.524
- Come on.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.364
- I just don't get it.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.830
She usually insists
on picking you up.

03:19.831 --> 03:21.365
- Raj is in town this week.

03:21.366 --> 03:23.466
They're having breakfast.
I told her I'd meet her here.

03:23.467 --> 03:25.134
- And now he's made her late.

03:25.135 --> 03:26.968
- She's not late yet,
so it's not our business.

03:26.969 --> 03:28.703
- Plus she's leaving early?

03:28.704 --> 03:30.904
I'm sorry.
Divya's not comfortable

03:30.905 --> 03:32.939
Unless she's at 110%.

03:32.940 --> 03:34.574
You know that.
I know that.

03:34.575 --> 03:36.342
I don't think raj
gets that about her.

03:36.343 --> 03:37.642
- I'm sorry.
Who's marrying her?

03:37.643 --> 03:39.277
You or raj?

03:39.278 --> 03:41.111
And she's not leaving early
because of him.

03:41.112 --> 03:42.645
Her mom's throwing a bridal tea

03:42.646 --> 03:43.812
At the Plaza in Manhattan.

03:43.813 --> 03:45.013
Raj isn't even invited.

03:45.014 --> 03:48.249
- Still, it is
an arranged marriage.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.216
Like, what if raj
takes her for granted?

03:50.217 --> 03:52.118
- It's not fair
to judge the guy.

03:52.119 --> 03:53.552
We hardly know him.

03:53.553 --> 03:56.720
- I just want to do
my best judging.

03:56.721 --> 03:58.088
I'm gonna confront her.

03:58.089 --> 03:59.289
- No, you're gonna drive away.

03:59.290 --> 04:00.489
You're gonna drive away,

04:00.490 --> 04:02.358
And she and I
are going to work.

04:02.359 --> 04:04.926
Good-bye.

04:04.927 --> 04:07.927
- On the phone, he complained
of chronic sinusitis.

04:07.928 --> 04:09.661
Uh, he's suffered
for the past year.

04:09.662 --> 04:10.928
- Ooh, that's rough.

04:10.929 --> 04:12.896
- He has a prescription
from his doctor in the city,

04:12.897 --> 04:14.031
But he's...

04:14.032 --> 04:15.332
- No, no, no,
I'll make that call.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.598
Well, I'll tell you why.

04:16.599 --> 04:18.132
Two reasons...
one, I'm the CEO,

04:18.134 --> 04:20.334
And two, see my first reason.

04:20.334 --> 04:21.567
Sorry to keep you,
Ms. Katdare.

04:21.569 --> 04:22.769
- Pleased to meet you.

04:22.770 --> 04:24.170
Mr. Keller,
this is Dr. Lawson.

04:24.171 --> 04:25.170
- Ken Keller.

04:25.171 --> 04:26.805
- It's nice to meet you.

04:26.806 --> 04:28.139
I hope you're packing some
serious pain relief, doc.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.874
- Uh, yeah.
So you've got sinusitis?

04:30.875 --> 04:32.642
- Yeah, it started
out of nowhere last summer.

04:32.643 --> 04:33.909
I've always been
healthy as an ox.

04:33.910 --> 04:35.377
- Horse.
- Hmm?

04:35.378 --> 04:38.579
- Anyway, head back.
Thanks.

04:38.580 --> 04:39.947
Okay.
Does that hurt?

04:39.948 --> 04:40.981
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

04:40.982 --> 04:43.116
Yup, paranasal sinuses
are inflamed.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.617
Where do you feel the pressure?

04:44.618 --> 04:46.085
- No, it's not pressure.
It's pain.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.820
It's in both cheeks
and behind my eyes.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.654
- Runny nose?
- Yeah.

04:49.655 --> 04:51.089
- Discharge
either green or bloody?

04:51.090 --> 04:52.590
- No.
- Halitosis?

04:52.591 --> 04:54.458
- No one's called me out.

04:54.459 --> 04:55.893
- Right, but then again,
who would?

04:55.894 --> 05:00.163
I mean, you're the CEO.
Bend over for me?

05:00.164 --> 05:01.130
Does that make it worse?

05:01.131 --> 05:02.131
- Yeah, a lot.

05:02.132 --> 05:03.598
- Does the pressure migrate?

05:03.599 --> 05:05.200
- Again, it's pain.

05:05.201 --> 05:08.002
- Mm.
Well, interesting.

05:08.003 --> 05:12.072
- Okay, Mr. Keller,
you can stand up now.

05:12.073 --> 05:13.707
- Corticosteroids help?

05:13.708 --> 05:15.908
- Yeah, these do.
A bit.

05:15.909 --> 05:18.910
- I will write you a refill.

05:18.911 --> 05:21.146
- And we can administer
a dose now

05:21.147 --> 05:23.417
To give you
some immediate relief.

05:23.418 --> 05:28.054
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

05:28.055 --> 05:30.656
- Okay, what was that about?

05:30.657 --> 05:32.224
- What?
Guy bugged me.

05:32.225 --> 05:33.492
- How?

05:33.493 --> 05:36.128
- By stealing my lunch money
and my lunch,

05:36.129 --> 05:38.163
Copying my homework,
cheating off my tests,

05:38.164 --> 05:40.498
Ransacking my locker,
and breaking my nose.

05:40.499 --> 05:43.001
- All that happened
while I was using his bathroom?

05:43.002 --> 05:44.168
- It happened in junior high.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.703
- I see.

05:45.704 --> 05:47.170
- And he didn't
even recognize me.

05:47.171 --> 05:48.705
I mean, I was sure
as time went by

05:48.706 --> 05:50.240
He'd get what he deserved.

05:50.241 --> 05:51.708
And it didn't have
to be federal prison.

05:51.709 --> 05:53.543
You know,
I would have been fine

05:53.544 --> 05:55.545
With bald and broke and still
stuck living in Passaic.

05:55.546 --> 05:57.179
- Well, looks like
he's done okay.

05:57.180 --> 05:58.513
- Yeah.

05:58.514 --> 05:59.547
- But then again, so have you.

05:59.548 --> 06:01.916
- I never told anyone
that he hit me,

06:01.917 --> 06:05.052
But I promised myself that
one day, I'd return the favor.

06:05.053 --> 06:06.053
- What, and break his nose?

06:06.054 --> 06:07.587
- Well...

06:07.588 --> 06:08.788
- Well, thank goodness

06:08.789 --> 06:10.256
You've outgrown
that adolescent fantasy.

06:10.257 --> 06:11.958
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.312
- Hey, guys.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.680
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:54.681 --> 06:55.981
- You know what?
I'm really sorry.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.883
We already have all
the Mary Kay products we need.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.884
- Shut it. Hey.

06:59.885 --> 07:01.586
Aren't you going
into the city with Divya?

07:01.587 --> 07:04.321
- Well, I was, when I got
a phone call from someone

07:04.322 --> 07:07.290
Who I thought could be
our first clinic patient.

07:07.291 --> 07:09.659
- You mean the clinic we haven't
officially started yet?

07:09.660 --> 07:10.926
- Yeah.

07:10.927 --> 07:12.628
But it sounds like
a good test case.

07:12.629 --> 07:14.196
A dislocated shoulder.

07:14.197 --> 07:15.931
Those are pretty painful,
right?

07:15.932 --> 07:17.732
- They are indeed.
Can Divya wait?

07:17.733 --> 07:19.767
- She'll pick me up there.
- Nice. Let's go.

07:19.768 --> 07:20.935
- Wait. Wait.

07:20.936 --> 07:22.336
Guys, none of this can happen

07:22.337 --> 07:24.804
Until I have data
for use of proceeds analysis,

07:24.805 --> 07:26.372
Mapping out a service area...

07:26.373 --> 07:28.808
- We, you can wait here
for the data to come visit you,

07:28.809 --> 07:30.710
Or you can join us
and get it boots on the ground.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.379
- Now, or after
this cartoon ends?

07:32.380 --> 07:34.180
- Let's go.

07:34.181 --> 07:35.948
- Because...

07:47.191 --> 07:48.925
- That should numb you up.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.859
How did this happen?

07:50.860 --> 07:52.327
- In the gym.

07:52.328 --> 07:53.729
- All right,
come down on the floor.

07:53.730 --> 07:56.166
Easy.

07:56.167 --> 07:58.003
Okay. Down.

07:58.004 --> 07:59.004
Okay.

07:59.005 --> 08:01.105
- I know.
There you go.

08:01.106 --> 08:06.009
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:06.010 --> 08:08.744
Ay.

08:11.914 --> 08:13.848
- Yows.

08:13.849 --> 08:15.383
- You okay?

08:15.384 --> 08:16.950
- That feels a lot better.

08:16.951 --> 08:19.853
- Good. Here, let's have
a seat over here.

08:19.854 --> 08:22.522
Easy.

08:22.523 --> 08:24.223
All right.

08:24.224 --> 08:27.325
You have got
a high pain tolerance.

08:27.326 --> 08:28.660
- That's a talent of mine.

08:28.661 --> 08:29.894
I can smile through anything.

08:29.895 --> 08:31.762
- No, seriously, most people
would have called 911.

08:31.763 --> 08:34.264
- Or screamed loud enough
that someone else would have.

08:34.265 --> 08:35.265
Like, wow.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.765
- And instead

08:36.767 --> 08:38.301
You get to be our first
concierge clinic patient.

08:38.302 --> 08:39.469
- Yeah, how does that work?

08:39.470 --> 08:40.903
<i>- How does that work?</i>

08:40.904 --> 08:44.239
- Uh, well, we're still
in an exploratory phase,

08:44.240 --> 08:46.408
Rendering services
on a limited basis

08:46.409 --> 08:48.142
That are billable
to a non-profit fund

08:48.143 --> 08:49.343
That I have set up...

08:49.344 --> 08:50.778
- Jill, you're gonna
bore her to death,

08:50.779 --> 08:52.313
And then we will
actually have to call 911.

08:52.314 --> 08:53.347
Hi.
Uh, we didn't meet before.

08:53.348 --> 08:54.314
I'm Evan r. Lawson.

08:54.315 --> 08:56.048
I'm the CFO of hankmed

08:56.049 --> 08:58.717
As well as whatever
this clinic thing is.

08:58.718 --> 08:59.885
Um, are you currently employed?

08:59.886 --> 09:01.486
- Uh, I used to be full-time

09:01.487 --> 09:03.021
At the parks and rec
department,

09:03.022 --> 09:05.289
But with the economy,
now I'm part time.

09:05.290 --> 09:07.124
I lost my benefits,

09:07.125 --> 09:08.691
And aqua aerobics
for elders and others

09:08.692 --> 09:10.293
Is just a memory.

09:10.294 --> 09:11.694
- Come on up.

09:11.695 --> 09:13.129
- So would clinic
care be something

09:13.130 --> 09:14.797
You'd use regularly
or on an as-needed basis?

09:14.798 --> 09:16.332
- As needed, I think.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.400
- Okay.
Final question.

09:18.401 --> 09:20.134
Are you a fireman?

09:20.135 --> 09:23.203
- What?

09:23.204 --> 09:25.504
- Oh, no, that's my roommate's
portable pole.

09:25.505 --> 09:26.905
She's a dancer.

09:28.274 --> 09:29.373
- Oh, uh, excuse me.
Sorry.

09:29.374 --> 09:30.774
- Yeah, no.

09:30.775 --> 09:33.009
- Portable pole.

09:33.010 --> 09:35.812
God bless America.

09:40.519 --> 09:43.620
"have pole, will travel."

09:46.591 --> 09:48.725
- Well, look at you,
all Jackie o.

09:48.726 --> 09:50.594
- Oh. You going to a tea
or a funeral?

09:50.595 --> 09:52.097
- Come any closer
and it can be both.

09:52.098 --> 09:53.599
- We'll still be on time,
won't we?

09:53.600 --> 09:54.768
- Sadly, yes.

09:54.769 --> 09:55.936
- Well, let's go.

09:55.937 --> 09:58.004
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

09:59.506 --> 10:00.874
- I just had a brainstorm.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.409
- I didn't think storms
could occur in a vacuum.

10:02.410 --> 10:04.945
- Dude, so the ladies
are off to tea...

10:04.946 --> 10:06.380
- Mm-hmm.

10:06.381 --> 10:07.647
- I just got a business card
from a stripper...

10:07.648 --> 10:09.082
- Right.
- And raj is here alone.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.583
- Okay.

10:10.584 --> 10:13.386
- The universe is telling us
to throw him a bachelor party.

10:13.387 --> 10:15.355
- Funny, I didn't
hear the universe say that.

10:15.356 --> 10:16.789
- No, we have
to conduct due diligence

10:16.790 --> 10:18.258
On divya's behalf, right?

10:18.259 --> 10:19.659
We owe her that.
You said it yourself.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.927
We don't even know this guy.

10:20.928 --> 10:22.628
- Yeah, we could have dinner
and get to know him.

10:22.629 --> 10:23.829
- Dinner?
- Yeah.

10:23.830 --> 10:25.498
- Anyone can negotiate
the perils of dinner.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.832
You want the true measure
of a man,

10:26.833 --> 10:29.067
You don't eat with him,
you drink with him.

10:29.068 --> 10:30.368
And then
you drink more with him.

10:30.369 --> 10:32.469
And then you ogle with him.

10:32.470 --> 10:34.237
You can't ignore it, Henry.
It's karma.

10:34.238 --> 10:35.338
- You mean coincidence.

10:35.339 --> 10:37.240
- No, actually, I mean karma.

10:37.241 --> 10:39.142
- Oh.
- Yeah.

10:46.019 --> 10:48.287
- Do you have any idea
how long we've been here?

10:48.288 --> 10:51.356
- Two hours and 43 minutes.

10:51.357 --> 10:55.293
Oh. 44.

10:55.294 --> 10:58.296
- Divya, you're not
wearing stockings.

10:58.297 --> 10:59.931
Your sister's
wearing stockings.

10:59.932 --> 11:01.198
- Of course she is.

11:01.199 --> 11:03.133
- Just keep your legs
under the table.

11:04.869 --> 11:07.370
- Sorry. May I have
everyone's attention?

11:07.371 --> 11:11.173
As you know, a marriage
does more than unite two people.

11:11.174 --> 11:13.142
It joins two families.

11:13.143 --> 11:14.843
And it pleases me to no end

11:14.844 --> 11:16.944
To see two
such wonderful families

11:16.945 --> 11:19.213
Being brought together
by divya and raj.

11:19.214 --> 11:22.115
My dear sister divya,
may you and raj

11:22.116 --> 11:24.618
Be as blessed
as Sanjay and I have been

11:24.619 --> 11:26.453
With a marriage based on love,

11:26.454 --> 11:29.322
Honesty, and respect.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.394
- Divya.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.061
- It isn't me.

11:37.062 --> 11:39.997
- Oh, sorry.
It's me.

11:39.998 --> 11:43.266
Oh. Sanjay caught
an earlier flight

11:43.267 --> 11:44.868
And needs me to go pick him up
at the airport.

11:44.869 --> 11:46.135
- Well, duty calls.

11:46.136 --> 11:48.504
<i>- You'll learn that soon enough,
choti Behan.</i>

11:48.505 --> 11:49.638
- Maybe we can tag along.

11:49.639 --> 11:52.774
I mean, I never get to see you.

11:52.775 --> 11:57.545
- Divya, can't leave
your own party.

11:57.546 --> 12:00.414
- Bye, Jill.
- Bye.

12:00.415 --> 12:03.116
- You know, the party's breaking
up anyway, isn't it, mummy?

12:03.117 --> 12:05.752
Saya and I barely spoke
in the last two hours.

12:05.753 --> 12:06.753
- 46.

12:06.754 --> 12:07.754
- And 46 minutes.

12:07.755 --> 12:09.121
You know what?

12:09.122 --> 12:11.090
It would be nice
to have the drive to talk.

12:11.091 --> 12:14.059
- All right. Go ahead.
Be sisters.

12:14.060 --> 12:15.593
- Thank you, mummy.

12:15.594 --> 12:19.163
- Just walk quickly,
so people don't see your legs.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.333
- Hey, saya.

12:23.334 --> 12:25.868
We have been liberated.

12:25.869 --> 12:27.737
We can join you.

12:27.738 --> 12:29.372
- Except I'm not
going to the airport.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.739
- Well,
how is sanjay going to...

12:30.740 --> 12:32.207
- Sanjay's in Miami.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.808
We're looking at
a co-investment on a property

12:33.809 --> 12:35.410
And they need me...Now.

12:35.411 --> 12:37.211
- You lied.

12:37.212 --> 12:38.746
- Mother wouldn't have
let me go otherwise.

12:38.747 --> 12:40.147
You know how it is.

12:40.148 --> 12:42.049
You have to fight family
with family.

12:42.050 --> 12:46.119
Ooh, that's my colleague.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.687
Forgive me?

12:47.688 --> 12:49.855
- Of course.

12:52.959 --> 12:55.193
- I take it you GU
aren't so close.

12:55.194 --> 12:56.760
- We used to be.

12:56.761 --> 12:58.995
Even though
she was saya the Saint

12:58.996 --> 13:01.264
And I was divya the difficult.

13:01.265 --> 13:04.601
- You were the difficult one?

13:04.602 --> 13:06.769
- So shall we get
the car from the lot?

13:06.770 --> 13:08.637
- Hmm.

13:08.638 --> 13:11.406
We've got a $65 flat rate.

13:11.407 --> 13:13.141
- Welcome to Manhattan.

13:13.142 --> 13:15.075
What's your point?

13:15.076 --> 13:18.411
- My point is...
Let's get our money's worth.

13:21.515 --> 13:23.082
- Well, do you want
to trust the Internet,

13:23.083 --> 13:24.550
Or do you want to trust me

13:24.551 --> 13:27.152
Okay. Okay. Just... Mr. Keller,
I'll be by in the morning.

13:27.153 --> 13:28.353
Good night.

13:28.354 --> 13:29.521
How do we explain to people

13:29.522 --> 13:31.289
That Wikipedia does not
have a medical degree?

13:31.290 --> 13:34.992
- We could refer them
to hankmed.Com, which does.

13:34.993 --> 13:38.328
That's actually
a really good idea.

13:38.329 --> 13:40.563
- Come in.

13:40.564 --> 13:42.365
- Hi.

13:42.366 --> 13:44.066
I'm karma.

13:44.067 --> 13:45.601
- Oh.

13:45.602 --> 13:48.336
Well, hello, karma.

13:48.337 --> 13:50.771
Didn't you say your roommate
was the dancer?

13:50.772 --> 13:51.739
- Yeah.

13:51.740 --> 13:53.240
- Yeah, I'm never really sure

13:53.241 --> 13:54.742
How people will react.

13:54.743 --> 13:57.178
I'm really only doing this
to make ends meet.

13:57.179 --> 13:58.913
- Okay.
Where's your sling?

13:58.914 --> 14:01.115
- I heard that once my shoulder
felt okay I could just lose it.

14:01.116 --> 14:02.149
- Where did you hear that?

14:02.150 --> 14:03.817
- Wikipedia.
- Oh.

14:03.818 --> 14:07.054
- Oh, hey, after you guys left,
I had an idea.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.789
Instead of a private dancer,

14:08.790 --> 14:12.326
I could call myself
a concierge dancer.

14:12.327 --> 14:13.360
It's classy, right?

14:13.361 --> 14:15.329
- Very.
- Yes, yes.

14:15.330 --> 14:17.064
- So my pole is set up
in the big house.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.766
But if I'm gonna be dancing
for all those other people,

14:19.767 --> 14:21.568
I'm gonna have to charge more.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.204
- Oh, what other people, Evan?

14:24.205 --> 14:28.808
- What? I said raj
could bring a few friends.

14:32.379 --> 14:34.514
- Well, it looks like
he brought them all.

14:44.116 --> 14:45.515
- Could you wait here?
We'll be right back.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.954
- It's a little late in the day
for an homage to Audrey.

14:51.955 --> 14:53.823
- It is never too late.

14:53.824 --> 14:57.126
And this is where raj
bought my beautiful ring.

14:57.127 --> 14:58.727
- Oh.

14:58.728 --> 15:00.462
- Meter's running, baby girls.

15:00.463 --> 15:02.163
Want me to get that?
- Would you?

15:02.164 --> 15:04.299
- Let's make you look beautiful,
okay?

15:04.300 --> 15:07.135
On three.
One, two, three.

15:07.136 --> 15:09.803
Ow!

15:09.804 --> 15:11.271
So where to next?

15:11.272 --> 15:13.806
- Well, hold on.
I gotta find a nightclub.

15:13.807 --> 15:16.207
<i>- You don't need time out
for that, sweet thing.</i>

15:16.208 --> 15:19.176
You got Aristotle,
the philosopher king

15:19.177 --> 15:20.811
Of New York City nightlife.

15:20.812 --> 15:23.246
<i>Time out ain't gonna tell you
about the best clubs</i>

15:23.247 --> 15:27.149
In the meatpacking district.

15:27.150 --> 15:30.919
Uh-huh.
These are not the best clubs.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.154
These clubs pay
to be called the best clubs.

15:33.155 --> 15:34.288
No integrity.

15:34.289 --> 15:36.524
I get my 411
right from the source...

15:36.525 --> 15:37.892
The doormen.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.226
- And they don't
give you anything

15:39.227 --> 15:40.226
For bringing people in?

15:40.227 --> 15:41.460
- They better.

15:41.461 --> 15:43.462
Aristotle got to make
something on the deal.

15:45.164 --> 15:46.765
- Oh, sorry.

15:46.766 --> 15:49.767
Hello? Saya.

15:49.768 --> 15:52.002
Okay, slow down.

15:52.003 --> 15:57.274
<i>Okay, Didi, Didi, call 911,
and I'll be right there.</i>

15:57.275 --> 15:59.142
Okay, how quickly
can you get us to trump tower?

15:59.143 --> 16:01.678
- Hop in. Let's go.

16:01.679 --> 16:02.813
- Divya, what's going on?

16:02.814 --> 16:04.214
- It was my sister.

16:04.215 --> 16:06.916
She said that
it's a medical emergency.

16:06.917 --> 16:08.751
- Fast enough, doc?

16:08.752 --> 16:10.453
- You could have just said
it was right there.

16:12.556 --> 16:15.857
Aristotle gotta make
something on the deal.

16:15.858 --> 16:17.258
- We were doing some paperwork,

16:17.259 --> 16:19.160
And suddenly Frank
couldn't breathe.

16:19.161 --> 16:21.699
- Okay, Frank, inhale normally,

16:21.700 --> 16:24.334
But exhale like
you're blowing into a balloon.

16:24.335 --> 16:26.570
- Divya, he's turning blue.

16:26.571 --> 16:28.205
- Did you call 911?
- Uh-huh.

16:28.206 --> 16:29.873
- He's anaphylactic.
Jill, dump my bag.

16:29.874 --> 16:31.374
There's an epipen in there.

16:47.687 --> 16:50.088
- Thank you.

16:50.089 --> 16:51.990
- Do you have any clue
what could have caused this?

16:51.991 --> 16:53.491
No.

16:53.492 --> 16:55.026
- Is he okay now?

16:55.027 --> 16:58.062
- He still needs
to go to the hospital.

16:58.063 --> 17:01.098
I smell coconut.

17:01.099 --> 17:04.434
Did you use
a new soap or lotion?

17:04.435 --> 17:06.770
- Uh, yeah, I did.

17:06.771 --> 17:12.275
- I will write you
a prescription for prednisone.

17:12.276 --> 17:13.843
- Thank you.

17:13.844 --> 17:16.144
- Oh.
- You saved his life.

17:16.145 --> 17:20.778
- You're welcome.

17:20.779 --> 17:23.814
Saya,
you smell like coconut too.

17:23.815 --> 17:26.115
- It was my lotion he borrowed.

17:29.186 --> 17:31.386
- Saya.

17:31.387 --> 17:33.421
You're not wearing
any stockings.

17:38.660 --> 17:47.133
♪ ♪

17:47.134 --> 17:50.503
- Dieter.

17:50.504 --> 17:53.105
Hey, listen,
about this party...

17:53.106 --> 17:54.540
- Yes, I took the liberty

17:54.541 --> 17:56.308
Of supplementing
your brother's guest list.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.442
- You did?

17:57.443 --> 17:58.876
- Mr. Kuester
Von jurgens-ratenicz

17:58.877 --> 18:00.444
Is in quite good spirits
in Cuba.

18:00.445 --> 18:04.314
He said to consider this evening
a token of his appreciation.

18:04.315 --> 18:07.049
- Wow.
Uh, thank him for us.

18:07.050 --> 18:09.517
- Hank. Look.

18:09.518 --> 18:11.785
It's killer Keller!

18:11.786 --> 18:13.019
From the old neighborhood.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.687
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:14.688 --> 18:16.655
You were my patient
this morning.

18:16.656 --> 18:19.123
I... I didn't realize
you were the same Ken Keller.

18:19.124 --> 18:20.925
- I didn't realize
you were the same Hank.

18:20.926 --> 18:23.093
Those were the days, huh?

18:23.094 --> 18:26.997
- We're doing shots.
We are so doing shots.

18:26.998 --> 18:28.298
- So what are you doing here?

18:28.299 --> 18:29.366
- Oh, uh, my buddy's father's

18:29.367 --> 18:30.967
Law partner's banker,

18:30.968 --> 18:32.035
He knows this guy named Boris.

18:32.036 --> 18:33.670
- No, I meant you're sick.

18:33.671 --> 18:35.638
You should go home, rest,
and get plenty of fluids,

18:35.639 --> 18:38.973
Like I said on the phone.

18:45.481 --> 18:50.051
- So now you know how to make
an arranged marriage work.

18:50.052 --> 18:52.820
- You mean one based on love,
honesty, and respect.

18:52.821 --> 18:55.689
- It's the one that lives
in the real world.

18:55.690 --> 18:59.026
I have my life
and sanjay has his.

18:59.027 --> 19:01.695
Trust me. It'll be the same
for you and raj.

19:01.696 --> 19:03.663
Least you've had practice...
hiding your career.

19:12.275 --> 19:13.608
- So you like living in ldo

19:13.609 --> 19:15.577
- Very much.
It's a wonderful city.

19:15.578 --> 19:16.945
- Mm-hmm.

19:16.946 --> 19:18.514
Would you say it's a...

19:18.515 --> 19:19.982
It's a good place to party?

19:19.983 --> 19:21.351
- Oh, yes.

19:21.352 --> 19:22.752
If you know where to go.

19:22.753 --> 19:24.187
- Yeah. Do you?
Do you know where to go?

19:24.188 --> 19:26.389
To party?

19:26.390 --> 19:30.527
Do you like to party, raj?

19:30.528 --> 19:34.397
- Are you hitting on me?

19:34.398 --> 19:35.899
- Well, well, well.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.134
Apparently they'll let
anyone into this party.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.270
- Nice pole.
When do you go on?

19:40.271 --> 19:42.105
- Later on. I like to wait
for the high rolrs.

19:42.106 --> 19:43.473
- Mm-hmm.

19:43.474 --> 19:46.676
- Uh, no, Evan wanted to
organize a little bachelor party

19:46.677 --> 19:48.945
For divya's fiance,
but it sort of got out of hand.

19:48.946 --> 19:50.980
- Aren't bachelor parties
supposed to get out of hand?

19:50.981 --> 19:52.979
- Good point, good point.

19:52.980 --> 19:55.946
- So who is the man
of the hour?

19:55.947 --> 19:57.947
- Karma.

19:57.948 --> 19:59.747
- That would be me.

19:59.748 --> 20:01.446
- Well, it is time
for your private dance,

20:01.447 --> 20:02.980
So you won't be needing that.

20:02.981 --> 20:04.979
- Yeah.

20:11.784 --> 20:15.986
- You set him up.

20:15.987 --> 20:17.488
- Yeah, I realize that now.

20:17.489 --> 20:19.556
- Yeah.

20:19.557 --> 20:20.824
- I can't believe it.

20:20.825 --> 20:22.258
Saya was my role model.

20:22.259 --> 20:24.226
I thought if she could
make it work, so could I.

20:24.227 --> 20:27.562
- Divya,
you're not your sister.

20:27.563 --> 20:32.298
And your marriage won't be hers.
Okay?

20:32.299 --> 20:33.933
What are you doing?

20:33.934 --> 20:37.736
- I'm calling raj.

20:48.315 --> 20:52.183
- Jeez. Hey.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.585
- I am new at this,

20:53.586 --> 20:56.054
But I'm pretty sure
that doesn't happen often.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.521
- What... what took so...

20:57.522 --> 20:58.889
What? What is it?
Are you all right?

20:58.890 --> 20:59.923
Is everything okay?

20:59.924 --> 21:01.025
- Yeah, everything's great.

21:01.026 --> 21:03.026
It's just... it's a job thing.

21:03.027 --> 21:05.261
You wouldn't understand.
- Oh.

21:05.262 --> 21:07.664
- Well, back to work.

21:07.665 --> 21:09.532
- Yeah.
Back to...

21:12.169 --> 21:13.803
Hey, raj, buddy.

21:13.804 --> 21:15.640
Raj?

21:35.228 --> 21:38.130
- Feel better?
- Yeah.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.698
- Hey, baby girls.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.000
Everything okay?

21:41.001 --> 21:43.368
- Prognosis looks good.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.370
- Well, I'm back on duty
if you need a lift.

21:45.371 --> 21:48.707
- What do you say?
You want to call it a night?

21:48.708 --> 21:51.176
- No.
We came here to celebrate.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.510
And that's what I want to do.

21:52.511 --> 21:53.678
- Oh, that's my girl.

21:53.679 --> 21:56.614
- Let's go.
- All right.

21:59.452 --> 22:02.287
- Ladies, it is my belief
that a repeat cab fare

22:02.288 --> 22:05.223
Is never a coincidence.
It's karma.

22:05.224 --> 22:08.659
The universe has brought us
back together for a reason!

22:08.660 --> 22:09.927
You a doctor, right?

22:09.928 --> 22:11.195
- Physician assistant.

22:11.196 --> 22:12.396
- Can you write prescriptions?

22:12.397 --> 22:15.566
- If they're warranted.
Why?

22:15.567 --> 22:18.536
- My wife has been on me
about getting a check-up.

22:18.537 --> 22:20.938
I got no time.
- And?

22:20.939 --> 22:23.774
- I got acid reflux
like something severe.

22:23.775 --> 22:27.377
In about 20 minutes,
this kielbasa

22:27.378 --> 22:29.579
Is gonna be
all kinds of trouble.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.614
- Okay, tell you what.

22:31.615 --> 22:33.115
She'll give you a check-up

22:33.116 --> 22:36.418
If you drive us around the city
and show us the nightlife.

22:36.419 --> 22:38.153
- But first
put that sausage down.

22:41.724 --> 22:42.925
- Where to, ladies?

22:42.926 --> 22:46.929

- Has the bleeding stopped?

23:44.334 --> 23:46.134
- Thank you.
Not yet.

23:46.135 --> 23:48.136
Any neck pain,
change in vision,

23:48.137 --> 23:50.305
Numbness, or tingling
in the arms?

23:50.306 --> 23:52.240
- No, but it really hurts
when I breathe.

23:52.241 --> 23:53.842
Is it broken?

23:53.843 --> 23:57.181
- Um, that'd be a yes.

23:57.182 --> 23:58.550
- I am so sorry.

23:58.551 --> 24:00.251
You can send me the bill.

24:00.252 --> 24:02.854
Unless this could be one
of your free clinic thingies.

24:02.855 --> 24:04.891
- Yeah. Sure.

24:04.892 --> 24:08.561
- Listen, baby, why don't you
go get me another drink, okay?

24:08.562 --> 24:10.063
- How many have you had?

24:10.064 --> 24:11.265
- Like five or six.

24:11.266 --> 24:12.666
Why, you gonna cut me off?

24:12.667 --> 24:14.335
- On the contrary.
You need the anesthesia.

24:14.336 --> 24:16.237
- You're not gonna reset
his fracture right now, are you?

24:16.238 --> 24:17.405
- I am.

24:17.406 --> 24:18.840
- Don't you think
it's advisable

24:18.841 --> 24:20.175
To wait for the swelling
to go down first?

24:20.176 --> 24:21.509
- Is it?

24:21.510 --> 24:23.211
- Not with a deformity
this markedly displaced.

24:23.212 --> 24:25.347
He can't breathe through it.
- He has a mouth.

24:25.348 --> 24:26.482
- So do I.

24:26.483 --> 24:28.184
And while it thanks you
for the second opinion,

24:28.185 --> 24:29.619
This fracture
needs realigning now.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.287
- Okay, but let me just ask you
is this gonna hurt...

24:31.288 --> 24:35.390
Ow! Ugh!

24:35.391 --> 24:37.157
- What were you gonna ask?

24:37.158 --> 24:38.825
- Never mind.

24:38.826 --> 24:42.262
- I arranged a car to transport
the injured gentleman home.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.564
- Thank you, dieter.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.898
- This whole night
has been a disaster.

24:44.899 --> 24:47.501
- Does that include
what happened with raj, karma?

24:47.502 --> 24:49.236
What did happen with raj?

24:49.237 --> 24:51.505
- Confidentiality
is the first rule

24:51.506 --> 24:53.273
In any good concierge business.

24:53.274 --> 24:54.874
You know that.
- Mm-hmm.

24:54.875 --> 24:56.741
- But I do need to find him.

24:56.742 --> 24:59.007
We have unfinished business.

24:59.008 --> 25:03.676
- Yeah.

25:03.677 --> 25:05.010
- If you require, sir,

25:05.011 --> 25:06.578
There are certain rooms
in the manor house

25:06.579 --> 25:07.979
Which for certain reasons

25:07.980 --> 25:09.648
Are equipped with
audio visual surveillance.

25:09.649 --> 25:11.816
And that's one of 'em.

25:15.186 --> 25:19.990
- Here we go.

25:19.991 --> 25:21.926
- Aristotle,
what are you doing?

25:21.927 --> 25:23.060
- Hydrating.

25:23.061 --> 25:24.830
The first lady
says it's important.

25:24.831 --> 25:26.633
- Well,
try hydrating with water.

25:28.603 --> 25:30.737
- A proper diet is the best
treatment for acid reflux.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.773
- Okay, okay.
Are you guys going in or not?

25:32.774 --> 25:34.073
- I don't want to be a downer,

25:34.074 --> 25:35.341
But they'll never
let us in there.

25:35.342 --> 25:36.909
- Oh, why not?

25:36.910 --> 25:39.244
- Because we're dressed
like their mothers.

25:39.245 --> 25:42.843

26:32.552 --> 26:34.019
Where's Aristotle?

26:34.020 --> 26:35.787
- Whoa.
Whoa, hey, hey.

26:35.788 --> 26:38.990
Hey. Ah.

26:38.991 --> 26:41.692
Hey. Sorry to break
your strides, Jillya.

26:41.693 --> 26:43.794
Just had to, uh,
pay my respects.

26:43.795 --> 26:48.832
- Lovely. So kiss and fly
or hogs and heifers?

26:48.833 --> 26:50.300
- Are you always drinking?

26:50.301 --> 26:52.034
- You can't drive
like Aristotle drives

26:52.035 --> 26:53.502
Without working up a thirst.

26:53.503 --> 26:54.637
- And do you go frequently?

26:54.638 --> 26:57.005
- I drink, I go, or I explode.

26:57.006 --> 27:00.642
- You know, let's find
a 24-hour pharmacy.

27:00.643 --> 27:03.344
You may have something
other than acid reflux.

27:03.345 --> 27:04.344
- Uh-oh.

27:06.715 --> 27:08.046
- I don't know.

27:08.047 --> 27:09.512
I thought
it'd be more satisfying.

27:09.513 --> 27:12.147
I mean, resetting a nose
is better than breaking one,

27:12.148 --> 27:16.117
But the guy didn't even
remember bullying me,

27:16.118 --> 27:18.419
So it doesn't really count
as payback.

27:18.420 --> 27:21.654
- Okay, first of all, really?

27:21.655 --> 27:25.458
You waited 20 years
for payback?

27:25.459 --> 27:27.693
- Well, no, I mean,
I wasn't waiting,

27:27.694 --> 27:31.196
But, you know, you only get
so many opportunities in life

27:31.197 --> 27:32.664
To fix the past,

27:32.665 --> 27:34.198
So when one presents itself,

27:34.199 --> 27:35.700
Don't you try to take it?

27:35.701 --> 27:39.336
- Oh, Hank.
You never get to fix the past.

27:39.337 --> 27:44.275
All you can do is get as far
away from it as possible.

27:44.276 --> 27:47.544
Oh,
about second-guessing you

27:47.545 --> 27:50.047
On fixing that fracture...

27:50.048 --> 27:52.950
- Oh, yeah,
no need to apologize.

27:52.951 --> 27:55.753
- I was gonna ask
where to send my bill.

27:55.754 --> 27:59.323
- I'll tell you
where you can send it.

27:59.324 --> 28:04.327
You know, you're cute
when you think you're right.

28:04.328 --> 28:07.529

28:28.013 --> 28:30.147
- I know that diabetes
isn't welcome news,

28:30.148 --> 28:34.052
But once you get your
blood sugar under control,

28:34.053 --> 28:36.288
You will feel a lot better.

28:36.289 --> 28:38.992
You are not your diagnosis.

28:38.993 --> 28:40.493
- My cousin has the sugar ds.

28:40.494 --> 28:42.095
I know the drill.

28:42.096 --> 28:44.397

28:55.478 --> 28:57.482
What are we talking about?

28:57.483 --> 28:58.852
- The future.

28:58.853 --> 28:59.889
- Ooh, I'll drink to that.

28:59.890 --> 29:02.492
- To the future!

29:02.493 --> 29:04.560
- Whoo!

29:11.930 --> 29:13.264
- You have impressive balance.

29:13.265 --> 29:16.000
- Well, I was highly motivated.

29:16.001 --> 29:17.668
- I think I owe you one.

29:17.669 --> 29:19.169
- Do you always keep score?

29:22.906 --> 29:25.940
- Hey!

29:25.941 --> 29:27.041
Thanks for nothing, doc.

29:27.042 --> 29:29.608
Now my nose
won't stop bleeding.

29:29.609 --> 29:31.007
- You were right to come back.

29:31.008 --> 29:33.376
This bleeding concerns me.
Are you leaving?

29:33.377 --> 29:35.010
- I think I probably should.

29:35.011 --> 29:37.212
- Um, dinner later?

29:37.213 --> 29:39.181
- I'm too busy for dinner.
Too busy to date, really.

29:39.182 --> 29:41.385
Though I might have some time
later for a little cardio.

29:41.386 --> 29:42.586
- What am I?
A 24-hour fitness?

29:42.587 --> 29:44.020
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sorry.

29:44.021 --> 29:45.621
- Well, if you were,
I might consider joining.

29:45.622 --> 29:47.356
Though I don't like
long-term contracts.

29:47.357 --> 29:48.890
- I'm sorry.
Do you two want to be alone?

29:48.891 --> 29:51.792
- Oh, right.

29:54.062 --> 29:56.363
- What are you doing?
- A ring test.

29:56.364 --> 29:58.998
The paper absorbs each drop
as it spreads.

29:58.999 --> 30:03.302
- What are you looking for?

30:03.303 --> 30:05.271
- That.

30:05.272 --> 30:06.739
- Wow, nice call.

30:06.740 --> 30:08.808
- Wow what?
- You're not just bleeding.

30:08.809 --> 30:10.643
You're leaking
cerebrospinal fluid.

30:10.644 --> 30:12.011
- I'm what?

30:12.012 --> 30:13.212
- My guess is the nose fracture

30:13.213 --> 30:14.914
Broke your cribriform plate.

30:14.915 --> 30:16.682
It's a slow leak,
but we should do a ct.

30:16.683 --> 30:18.617
Unless you want
a second opinion.

30:18.618 --> 30:19.952
- What he said.
- Thank you.

30:19.953 --> 30:22.787
- Hank, you gotta come.
Right now.

30:26.224 --> 30:28.792
All right, Aristotle.

30:28.793 --> 30:31.428
Come on, buddy.
Rise and shine.

30:31.429 --> 30:34.030
We owe you breakfast.

30:34.031 --> 30:37.600
- And our life savings,
it seems.

30:37.601 --> 30:41.403
- Aristotle.

30:41.404 --> 30:45.906
Aristotle.

30:45.907 --> 30:48.542
- He stopped for doughnuts.

30:53.114 --> 30:54.614
- Aristotle!

30:54.615 --> 30:56.182
Help me get him on his back.

30:56.183 --> 30:58.417
Aristotle, can you hear me?
Aristotle.

31:01.741 --> 31:02.907
- Yeah, I've got a male,

31:02.908 --> 31:04.075
Mid-3os,
in hyperglycemic coma.

31:04.076 --> 31:05.276
- No, the paramedics
were ten minutes out.

31:05.277 --> 31:06.277
We couldn't wait.

31:06.278 --> 31:07.478
- Okay, get ready with fluids?

31:07.479 --> 31:09.079
- Standing by.
We're pulling in now.

31:17.087 --> 31:19.121
- Okay, got it.
- Backseat.

31:19.122 --> 31:20.289
- I'll get the front.

31:20.290 --> 31:21.623
- Okay, bring him out.

31:21.624 --> 31:23.458
- Middle-aged male
sugar binged

31:23.459 --> 31:25.293
After a 290 glucose
four hours ago.

31:25.294 --> 31:28.329
Probably dka,
but need to rule out HHS.

31:28.330 --> 31:31.198
- Right, calm down.
Just tell me what happened.

31:31.199 --> 31:33.333
- Okay, I couldn't find him.

31:33.334 --> 31:34.734
- Mm-hmm.
- I couldn't find karma.

31:34.735 --> 31:36.102
I looked everywhere.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.437
- Okay, and while
you were looking,

31:37.438 --> 31:38.706
You were probably
getting hammered.

31:38.707 --> 31:39.707
- No, I...
it was a party.

31:39.708 --> 31:40.708
I had a couple, okay?

31:40.709 --> 31:42.743
- Yeah.
- And then I saw them.

31:42.744 --> 31:44.912
Together.

31:47.013 --> 31:48.814
- A pleasure.
- Thanks.

31:53.150 --> 31:56.751
- Aah!

31:56.752 --> 31:58.987
I mean, maybe he's breathing.

31:58.988 --> 32:00.522
Maybe he's just
in a vegetative state.

32:00.523 --> 32:04.291
I don't know.
Oh, my God.

32:04.292 --> 32:06.559
- Funny you should mention
vegetables.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.228
- What's that?
- I don't think it's blood.

32:09.229 --> 32:10.362
I think it's bloody Mary.

32:10.363 --> 32:11.763
- What?

32:11.764 --> 32:16.067
- Raj?
Wake up, bud.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.034
Hey.

32:17.035 --> 32:21.838
- Oh. Man.

32:21.839 --> 32:24.407
- Who drinks
bloody Marys at night?

32:25.442 --> 32:27.877
Bad idea.
Never again.

32:27.878 --> 32:31.214
- Raj, did you fall?
Can you remember?

32:31.215 --> 32:32.848
- It's foggy.

32:32.849 --> 32:38.086
I recall Evan coming
to tell me...Something.

32:43.025 --> 32:45.894
- No, you don't...

32:45.895 --> 32:48.930
Aah!

32:48.931 --> 32:50.398
- Oh, my God.

32:50.399 --> 32:51.831
- I think you'd had too much.

32:55.967 --> 32:57.867
Not that I judge.

32:57.868 --> 33:00.603
I also didn't want to stop.

33:05.074 --> 33:09.143
I must have passed out
with a drink in my hand.

33:09.144 --> 33:10.845
- Okay.

33:10.846 --> 33:12.613
Mystery solved.

33:12.614 --> 33:13.914
I have a patient to see.

33:13.915 --> 33:15.615
- That doesn't explain karma.

33:15.616 --> 33:18.117
What happened to karma?
- What happened to karma?

33:18.118 --> 33:20.986
- What happened to karma, raj?

33:20.987 --> 33:23.422
- She went home?
- She went home.

33:23.423 --> 33:25.390
Congrats, buddy.

33:31.061 --> 33:32.595
- Set.

33:36.565 --> 33:40.000
Okay, lie still,
and we'll see what's going on.

33:40.001 --> 33:42.869
- Hey, this is something strong

33:42.870 --> 33:44.737
For those of us
with regrets about last night.

33:44.738 --> 33:46.438
No regrets.

33:46.439 --> 33:48.673
- But, uh,
thanks for the coffee.

33:48.674 --> 33:50.441
- Yeah.

33:56.718 --> 33:58.485
Hmm.

34:02.659 --> 34:04.527
- Good movie?

34:04.528 --> 34:07.529
- I don't know yet.
I'm gonna find out.

34:07.530 --> 34:10.665
- Dr. Peck,
come take a look at this.

34:15.002 --> 34:16.902
Did you ever
get poked in the eye, Ken?

34:16.904 --> 34:18.338
- With two older brothers?

34:18.339 --> 34:19.539
I can't count the black eyes.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.107
They used to bully me non-stop.

34:21.108 --> 34:22.608
- What is that?

34:22.609 --> 34:26.246
- Wait, this... I think
I can diagnose this one.

34:26.246 --> 34:27.782
Dude, did you ever
fight with your brothers

34:27.783 --> 34:29.217
Over action figures?

34:29.217 --> 34:30.552
- Yeah, that was one
of our favorite pastimes.

34:30.553 --> 34:32.654
- Like knights or pirates?

34:32.655 --> 34:34.188
- Yeah, they almost
poked my eye out

34:34.188 --> 34:36.056
With blackbeard's
little cutlass.

34:36.058 --> 34:37.292
My favorite.
And they lost it.

34:37.293 --> 34:39.193
- Yup.
They didn't lose it.

34:39.194 --> 34:41.396
It went through
the corner of the eye

34:41.397 --> 34:45.199
And got lodged right there
in your sinus cavity.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.201
- What?
That can happen?

34:47.202 --> 34:48.735
- Yeah,
I've seen worse in the E.R.

34:48.737 --> 34:50.203
- There's no way.
There's no frickin' way.

34:50.204 --> 34:51.670
I've had a sword in my eye
for 20 years

34:51.672 --> 34:53.139
And I didn't know it?
Come on.

34:53.139 --> 34:54.607
- Not your eye.
Your sinus.

34:54.608 --> 34:56.576
It's a cavity full of air
surrounded by bone.

34:56.577 --> 34:58.311
The sword's
been sitting in that space

34:58.312 --> 35:00.646
Leaving the bone, nerve,
and blood vessels undisturbed.

35:00.647 --> 35:01.747
- Oh, I'm plenty disturbed.

35:01.748 --> 35:03.148
I got a sword in my head.

35:03.149 --> 35:05.017
- We'll get this checked
at the hospital,

35:05.018 --> 35:08.087
But I'd say we've found
the cause of your sinus pain.

35:08.088 --> 35:09.255
- I'm gonna kick their asses.

35:09.256 --> 35:11.524
I am so gonna kick their asses.

35:11.525 --> 35:12.892
- That tiny piece of plastic

35:12.893 --> 35:15.194
Ate away at your
cribriform plate over the years.

35:15.195 --> 35:16.729
I bet you've been
leaking spinal fluid

35:16.730 --> 35:18.163
Since your sinus pain began.

35:18.164 --> 35:20.098
- So what you're saying,
Dr. Lawson,

35:20.099 --> 35:23.401
Is that if someone had broken
Mr. Keller's nose years ago,

35:23.402 --> 35:24.902
This would have been discovered,

35:24.903 --> 35:27.304
And he'd have been
spared a lot of suffering.

35:27.305 --> 35:30.373
- Yeah. Yeah.

35:30.374 --> 35:33.543
I mean, yeah.

35:33.544 --> 35:36.112
- I just wanted
one last hurrah.

35:36.113 --> 35:37.613
Guess I owe you girls.

35:37.614 --> 35:40.049
- It's mutual.
The meter's still running.

35:40.050 --> 35:41.451
- Ah, it's no problem.

35:41.452 --> 35:42.885
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:42.886 --> 35:45.188
If you don't have cash,
I take visa, mastercard,

35:45.189 --> 35:48.326
Amex, discover, Macy's,
costco, whatever, you know.

35:48.327 --> 35:50.528
- 'cause Aristotle gotta make
something on the deal.

35:50.529 --> 35:52.798
- Yeah, baby.

35:52.799 --> 35:57.470
- All right,
we'll check in on you later.

35:57.471 --> 35:59.138
- We have got
to get out of these clothes.

35:59.139 --> 36:00.373
- Yeah, before anyone,

36:00.374 --> 36:03.509
Besides my entire E.R. Staff,
sees us.

36:03.510 --> 36:07.746
- Oh.

36:07.747 --> 36:10.315
- Mr. Keller.
Oh, my gosh. Your nose.

36:10.316 --> 36:13.752
- Yeah, that's the least of it.

36:13.753 --> 36:14.753
- Wow.

36:14.754 --> 36:16.822
- Hank, you didn't.

36:16.823 --> 36:18.757
- Oh, it was karma.

36:18.758 --> 36:19.791
- So rough night?

36:19.792 --> 36:21.360
- You first.

36:21.361 --> 36:22.994
- Um...

36:22.995 --> 36:26.464
- Evan, Hank, the other doctor
said you'd come here.

36:26.465 --> 36:28.199
- Other doctor?

36:28.200 --> 36:30.101
- Divya.
- Good morning.

36:30.102 --> 36:31.302
- Is something wrong?

36:31.303 --> 36:33.338
- I hope not.

36:33.339 --> 36:35.807
But I remembered at the end
of last night's festivities,

36:35.808 --> 36:37.675
I took a certain liberty.

36:37.676 --> 36:40.144
- You know, raj, I... I don't
think now's the time.

36:40.145 --> 36:42.179
- Festivities?
Liberty?

36:42.180 --> 36:44.882
- Your colleagues threw me a...

36:44.883 --> 36:46.216
Why are you dressed like that?

36:46.217 --> 36:47.684
- Like what?

36:47.685 --> 36:50.955
- Right. Raj, um,
what's on your mind, pal?

36:50.956 --> 36:52.624
- It was not my place,

36:52.625 --> 36:58.293
But I allowed karma
to borrow your minivan.

36:58.294 --> 37:00.094
- Why?

37:00.095 --> 37:01.095
- I was drunk.

37:01.096 --> 37:02.363
- You were drunk?

37:02.364 --> 37:04.364
- No, I mean,
why did you give her my van?

37:04.365 --> 37:06.266
- She needed to leave.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.467
There were no taxis.

37:07.468 --> 37:08.935
You know what it's like
here on the weekend.

37:08.936 --> 37:10.369
- No taxis?

37:10.370 --> 37:12.938
Maybe I should relocate my ass
out to the Hamptons.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.007
What do you think, Jillya?

37:15.008 --> 37:17.008
- Who is that?
- Aristotle.

37:17.009 --> 37:19.343
- I thought I remembered karma
going through my pockets.

37:19.344 --> 37:20.611
- Karma?

37:20.612 --> 37:22.613
- The woman they hired for me.

37:22.614 --> 37:23.714
- To dance.
She was a dancer.

37:23.715 --> 37:24.948
- Just a dancer.

37:24.949 --> 37:29.252
- Okay,
what happened last night?

37:29.253 --> 37:31.387
- Well, we're still trying
to get to the bottom of that.

37:31.388 --> 37:34.323
- But not before everyone
has a shower and a nap.

37:34.324 --> 37:36.525
- Or maybe better we leave it
at no questions asked.

37:36.526 --> 37:37.825
- Yeah.
- Or that.

37:37.826 --> 37:39.760
- Oh?

37:39.761 --> 37:44.664
- It was a long night.

37:44.665 --> 37:48.034
I'll call you later.

37:48.035 --> 37:49.635
- See you, man.

37:49.636 --> 37:51.636
- Bye, raj.

37:51.637 --> 37:54.538
- Okay, yes,
shower, nap, great idea.

37:54.539 --> 37:57.440
We should go.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.441
- Bye.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.209
- Take care, guys.

38:00.210 --> 38:01.744
- Is this the beginning,
like saya said?

38:01.745 --> 38:03.212
- Let's just get you home.

38:03.213 --> 38:04.580
- I don't want separate lives.

38:04.581 --> 38:07.182
- I know.

38:07.183 --> 38:09.217
- Hank.

38:09.218 --> 38:11.186
Thank you.
For everything.

38:11.187 --> 38:12.587
- Hey, I'm just glad
we caught it.

38:12.588 --> 38:14.456
- I owe you an apology.

38:14.457 --> 38:16.258
I, uh, I knew exactly
who you were

38:16.259 --> 38:17.626
The minute I saw you.

38:17.627 --> 38:20.195
I... I was embarrassed
'cause of how I treated you

38:20.196 --> 38:21.363
Back in the day.

38:21.364 --> 38:22.998
I was a Dick.

38:22.999 --> 38:25.600
And you're a decent guy
for not saying anything.

38:25.601 --> 38:27.535
- Don't worry about it.

38:27.536 --> 38:31.339
The truth is,
I'd completely forgotten.

38:31.340 --> 38:33.808
- All right.
Let's go.

38:33.809 --> 38:35.710
- See ya.

38:36.713 --> 38:38.779
- All right.
Let's go.

38:41.965 --> 38:45.033
- I'm just saying
I think he crossed the line.

38:45.034 --> 38:46.468
Either he crossed the line,

38:46.469 --> 38:47.902
Or she did and he let her.

38:47.903 --> 38:49.370
- Assuming you're right,

38:49.371 --> 38:52.406
Then, yeah, yeah,
that does sound suspicious.

38:52.407 --> 38:55.041
- So what would you do if there
was video of what happened?

38:55.042 --> 38:56.743
- What?
There's no sense...

38:56.744 --> 38:58.177
- 'cause there is.

38:58.178 --> 38:59.478
And I've got it.

38:59.479 --> 39:00.713
- What?
- Yeah.

39:00.714 --> 39:02.448
Boris has
a surveillance system.

39:02.449 --> 39:04.683
- He does?
Where?

39:04.684 --> 39:06.218
- In rooms
where he conducts business.

39:06.219 --> 39:08.253
- Oh. Okay.

39:08.254 --> 39:10.488
- So what do we do?

39:10.489 --> 39:11.622
Do we watch it?

39:11.623 --> 39:13.224
- No. No.

39:13.225 --> 39:14.892
People should be allowed
their privacy.

39:14.893 --> 39:17.093
- You mean their secrets.

39:17.094 --> 39:19.195
- Fine.

39:19.196 --> 39:21.063
Their secrets.

39:21.064 --> 39:23.732
- So what do you make of Emily?

39:23.733 --> 39:25.634
- Uh, I don't know.

39:25.635 --> 39:28.503
I'm still feeling her out,
you know.

39:28.504 --> 39:30.171
What do you think?

39:30.172 --> 39:31.939
- I think she's got
your medical skills,

39:31.940 --> 39:33.974
My social ones, and she's
hotter than either of us,

39:33.975 --> 39:36.043
So that spells danger to me.

39:36.044 --> 39:38.611
- All right, now you're being
overly suspicious.

39:38.612 --> 39:40.947
- I'm not being...
I'm being protective, okay?

39:40.948 --> 39:43.182
This is hankmed
we're talking about.

39:52.492 --> 39:53.992
- Excuse me?

39:53.993 --> 39:55.260
- Hello.

39:55.261 --> 39:56.962
- Hi, I'm just
returning these to Evan.

39:56.963 --> 39:57.963
- Sure.

39:57.964 --> 40:00.432
I can give these to him.

40:00.433 --> 40:02.000
You must be karma.

40:02.001 --> 40:04.169
- You must be divya.

40:04.170 --> 40:09.109
Well, I don't know if
you're smart or lucky or both,

40:09.110 --> 40:10.344
But congratulations.

40:10.345 --> 40:13.046
He's quite the catch.

40:22.623 --> 40:24.957
- So this is sort of
a backup plan?

40:24.958 --> 40:26.560
- This is sort of...

40:26.561 --> 40:28.295
- Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no!

40:28.296 --> 40:29.663
Give me that! Hey! Hey!
That's mine.

40:29.664 --> 40:31.064
Have you no respect
for privacy?

40:31.065 --> 40:33.333
- Oh, said the man who has
security footage of my fiance.

40:33.334 --> 40:34.334
- I know.
Look...

40:34.335 --> 40:35.501
- Just give it up, Ev.

40:35.502 --> 40:37.904
No, get... shh.
Easy.

40:37.905 --> 40:39.605
- I'm in the hotel business,

40:39.606 --> 40:41.907
And we're looking
for fitness instructors

40:41.908 --> 40:44.209
At one of our local properties.

40:44.210 --> 40:46.277
I could make a call
if you'd like.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.344
- Are you kidding?

40:47.345 --> 40:50.948
Oh, thank you.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.283
I'm sorry I got glitter
all over you.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.785
- Oh, that's all right.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.221
- I hope your bride knows
how lucky she is.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.156
- Ah, I'm the lucky one.

41:00.157 --> 41:02.592
Most women like her would enjoy
a life of leisure,

41:02.593 --> 41:07.463
But divya's brilliant and kind

41:07.464 --> 41:09.698
And dedicated
to helping others.

41:09.699 --> 41:15.903
And so I'm dedicated to never
taking her for granted.

41:15.904 --> 41:17.671
- Well, it sounds
like you don't want a dance.

41:17.672 --> 41:19.873
- Oh, no.

41:19.874 --> 41:22.608
But please don't tell
Hank and Evan.

41:22.609 --> 41:23.609
They're so nice,

41:23.610 --> 41:25.077
I'd hate for them

41:25.078 --> 41:26.978
To think nothing obscene
happened in here.

41:26.979 --> 41:29.014
- I promise.

41:29.015 --> 41:32.352
Thank you.

41:32.353 --> 41:36.627
- Saya was wrong.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.764
- Hmm?

41:40.467 --> 41:43.869
- What's... what is this?

41:43.870 --> 41:44.870
Who's that?

41:44.871 --> 41:46.405
- Oh, my God.

41:46.406 --> 41:49.542
- oh, yeah.

41:49.543 --> 41:51.778
I vaguely remember this.

41:51.779 --> 41:54.283
That's... I'm actually
not that bad.

41:54.284 --> 41:58.086
- You're actually
not that good.

41:58.087 --> 42:00.155
No, don't quit your day job
there, cinnamon.

42:00.156 --> 42:02.958
- Ah.
