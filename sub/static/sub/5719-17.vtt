WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:01.546
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.625 --> 00:03.185
Looks like a surgical incision.

00:03.238 --> 00:05.445
There is your story right there,
they removed your gallbladder.

00:05.511 --> 00:07.529
I know you're still pissed
about that whole poaching thing.

00:07.564 --> 00:09.998
You mean, how you profited
off the slaughter of animals.

00:10.033 --> 00:12.267
Maybe you didn't hear but I turned
those guys in. I did the right thing.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.403
Don't make light of this.

00:14.438 --> 00:16.004
We'll just portend it never happened.

00:16.039 --> 00:17.339
That's right.

00:17.374 --> 00:19.808
Because I don't want
things to get weird.

00:25.215 --> 00:27.515
What the hell. Things are weird already.

00:35.725 --> 00:37.959
Whoa! Spirit!

00:37.994 --> 00:40.400
Cassandra! Pull up!

00:40.550 --> 00:42.530
- I'm trying!
- Pull up!

00:43.933 --> 00:45.833
Circle him! Just circle him.

00:47.236 --> 00:48.602
Pull up!

00:48.638 --> 00:50.003
It's okay!

00:50.039 --> 00:52.005
Whoa! Spirit.

00:52.041 --> 00:54.041
Good boy, good boy.

00:54.076 --> 00:55.609
Are you okay?

00:55.645 --> 00:56.977
Yeah. Just get me off this horse.

00:57.012 --> 00:59.046
Okay. okay. okay. Whoa!

00:59.081 --> 01:00.380
Oh God!

01:01.817 --> 01:03.183
I can't believe Caleb
would buy you a horse

01:03.219 --> 01:04.617
that bolts like that?

01:04.653 --> 01:07.387
Some guys buy their girlfriends jewelry.

01:07.422 --> 01:08.956
Not Caleb.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.498
Wow. The Hudson heritage foundation

01:18.533 --> 01:20.533
is making a big deal out
of their party this year.

01:20.569 --> 01:22.068
I'm glad I got our tickets early.

01:22.103 --> 01:23.703
Yeah, what's that about anyway?

01:23.739 --> 01:25.104
What do you mean?

01:25.139 --> 01:26.506
Well,
they throw this party every winter.

01:26.541 --> 01:28.941
And you've never been
this gung-ho to go before.

01:28.977 --> 01:30.677
Well, I just think it's a great
chance for us all to dress up

01:30.712 --> 01:32.378
and go out together.

01:32.413 --> 01:35.314
- Is Remi in here?
- No.

01:35.350 --> 01:36.883
Look at this!

01:36.918 --> 01:40.987
My brand new fly tying stuff
just torn apart by that dog!

01:41.022 --> 01:42.989
Oh Jack,
you're just gonna go to the store

01:43.024 --> 01:44.490
and buy some new supplies.

01:44.525 --> 01:46.392
No, I'm not.

01:46.427 --> 01:49.595
This stuff cost a fortune I'm
not just gonna replace it.

01:49.630 --> 01:51.196
That dog is a menace.

01:51.231 --> 01:53.298
If any of you see Remi,
I want you to put her outside.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.267
We're not gonna do that.
It's freezing outside.

01:55.302 --> 01:57.269
Well, she got hair, doesn't she?

01:57.304 --> 02:00.005
You have to admit, you left the
stinky stuff lying around...

02:00.040 --> 02:01.540
Oh, so it's my fault?

02:01.575 --> 02:03.074
You do leave your stuff lying around.

02:03.110 --> 02:04.710
Yeah, you've always been like that,
Jack.

02:04.745 --> 02:07.012
It's not just 'cause you're old.

02:07.047 --> 02:09.413
Well, sure is nice to know

02:09.449 --> 02:13.418
that when push comes to shove
you all take a dog's side.

02:15.422 --> 02:16.854
Looking good, bud.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074

02:31.271 --> 02:32.503
Hey, sorry we're late.

02:32.539 --> 02:33.905
Ah, don't worry about it.

02:33.940 --> 02:35.306
Jade's in the back pen.

02:35.341 --> 02:36.707
She'll fill you in on our new arrivals.

02:36.743 --> 02:38.108
- Okay?
- Okay.

02:38.144 --> 02:39.509
Hey. Looks like you've been busy.

02:39.545 --> 02:40.911
Yeah, the new clinic is
coming along real nice.

02:40.947 --> 02:42.346
Hey, you got a few minutes
to take a look around?

02:42.381 --> 02:43.713
Yeah, for sure.

02:43.749 --> 02:45.115
Awesome. Just over here.

02:45.628 --> 02:47.918
Okay. I get it.

02:48.231 --> 02:50.720
I'm not mad. Just a little disappointed.

02:50.756 --> 02:52.222
I'm sorry, Georgie.

02:52.258 --> 02:53.790
My parents won't let me go.

02:53.826 --> 02:55.291
Maybe you can give my ticket to Jade.

02:55.327 --> 02:57.360
Jade already has one.

02:57.395 --> 02:58.762
What do I have?

02:58.797 --> 03:00.464
A ticket to the party tonight.

03:00.499 --> 03:02.432
Adam's not allowed to go.

03:02.468 --> 03:05.435
Well, good. I mean, not good
for you but good for me,

03:05.471 --> 03:07.003
since I won't have to be a third wheel.

03:07.038 --> 03:08.404
Agh.

03:09.875 --> 03:12.175
Oh, look at these guys! They're so cute!

03:12.210 --> 03:14.944
Don't be fooled. They may look adorable

03:14.980 --> 03:17.680
with their stubby little legs and big,
brown eyes,

03:17.715 --> 03:19.449
but they're not.

03:19.484 --> 03:21.150
They're stubborn little monsters.

03:21.186 --> 03:22.585
Where did they come from?

03:22.620 --> 03:23.987
They were rescued from
some third rate petting zoo

03:24.022 --> 03:25.488
after the owners skipped town.

03:25.523 --> 03:26.889
Bob wants us to give them a good brush.

03:26.924 --> 03:28.357
But I don't know why it's so important.

03:28.392 --> 03:30.025
A horse's hair grows
longer in the winter.

03:30.060 --> 03:32.194
If it gets matted and dirty
it can create cold spots

03:32.229 --> 03:34.062
which can lead to hypothermia.

03:34.098 --> 03:36.832
Did you manage to download all
of Wikipedia into your brain?

03:38.268 --> 03:40.369
He's right.
I doesn't look like any of these horses

03:40.404 --> 03:42.237
have ever been groomed before.

03:42.272 --> 03:44.406
Okay. Let's get started.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.509
Nothing fancy, but when it's done

03:47.544 --> 03:49.944
I'll be able to help a lot more animals.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.080
But I'm gonna need volunteers.
That's where you come in.

03:52.116 --> 03:53.781
Hey, sign me up.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.183
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:55.219 --> 03:56.818
Will you consider sitting on the board?

03:56.853 --> 03:58.286
You have a board?

03:58.322 --> 04:00.222
Yeah, man. I'm totally legit now.

04:00.257 --> 04:03.391
I've got like...
donors, accountants, board members.

04:03.426 --> 04:05.660
When I go to meetings I wear a tie.

04:05.695 --> 04:07.294
- No you don't.
- Yeah.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.930
- Really?
- It's pretty awesome, man.

04:08.965 --> 04:10.498
Oh hold on a sec, okay?

04:10.534 --> 04:12.166
Oh okay.

04:13.247 --> 04:14.368
Hello.

04:14.404 --> 04:16.538
It's quite the beard you got there, Bob.

04:16.572 --> 04:18.839
Maybe you should consider
a trip to the barber.

04:18.874 --> 04:20.440
Who is this?

04:20.476 --> 04:21.875
Oh, you don't know me.

04:21.911 --> 04:24.311
But I've been keeping
a close eye on you.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.048
In fact, I'm looking at you right now.

04:27.083 --> 04:30.151
Okay. What do you want?

04:31.820 --> 04:34.387
You sent two of my employees to jail.

04:34.423 --> 04:36.459
I'll tell you, Bob,

04:36.539 --> 04:38.659
the only thing harder than finding a
reliable source of bear gallbladders,

04:38.694 --> 04:40.861
is finding good employees.

04:42.013 --> 04:44.464
We had a great thing going.
What happened?

04:45.935 --> 04:47.670
Look, I don't do that anymore.

04:48.172 --> 04:49.970
Well, that's too bad.

04:50.005 --> 04:51.804
Because your new found conscience
has cost me a lot of money.

04:51.839 --> 04:54.574
But luckily,
you're in a position to redeem yourself.

04:54.609 --> 04:56.576
Look,
I'm hanging up and calling the police.

04:56.611 --> 04:59.011
If you do that I can't
guarantee your safety.

04:59.047 --> 05:00.713
Or the safety of those sweet little kids

05:00.748 --> 05:02.949
you've got working there.

05:02.984 --> 05:05.385
I'll call you back
later when you're alone.

05:05.420 --> 05:08.621
And remember, I got my eye on you.

05:10.291 --> 05:13.626
Bob, I'm gonna head out now.
Sorry to interrupt.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.828
No it's cool.
Oh yeah, Ill see you later.

05:15.863 --> 05:17.296
Okay.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.032
Hey, uh, Ty...

05:23.737 --> 05:26.171
Just drive safe.

05:26.207 --> 05:27.706
It's icy out there.

05:27.741 --> 05:29.074
Okay.

05:33.315 --> 05:35.853
S09E17
Love Is Just a Word

05:36.196 --> 05:39.567
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

06:13.485 --> 06:15.085
Spirit is way too high strung a horse

06:15.120 --> 06:16.653
for an inexperienced rider.

06:16.688 --> 06:18.221
Well, teach me how to handle him.

06:18.257 --> 06:21.291
It's not just a matter
of teaching you...

06:21.327 --> 06:24.828
Look, yesterday I performed
a liver lobectomy on a dog.

06:24.863 --> 06:26.629
A year ago I would have had no clue

06:26.665 --> 06:28.598
how to do a surgery like that.
But I learned.

06:28.633 --> 06:31.093
It's not the same thing, Cassandra.

06:31.661 --> 06:33.577
If I can fix a diseased liver,

06:33.630 --> 06:35.271
I can figure out how to handle Spirit.

06:35.306 --> 06:37.907
I just need your help.

06:44.349 --> 06:46.748
There is some guests checking
in at the dude ranch next week

06:46.784 --> 06:49.685
and we're running
pretty low on fire wood.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.454
I'll pick some up tomorrow.

06:51.489 --> 06:53.189
Make it a full cord.

06:53.713 --> 06:56.595
Yes ma'am. Is there anything else?

06:57.546 --> 06:58.760
No. That's it.

07:00.731 --> 07:02.465
Actually, there's one more thing...

07:03.934 --> 07:05.433
It's about us...

07:05.963 --> 07:08.003
I think we need to
lay some ground rules.

07:09.406 --> 07:10.772
I know how you like rules.

07:10.808 --> 07:12.440
I'm serious.

07:12.476 --> 07:14.109
I have two daughters to think about.

07:14.144 --> 07:17.653
And whatever's happening between us

07:17.825 --> 07:19.780
I think we should keep it quiet.

07:21.351 --> 07:24.886
And what if I don't want to
be your dirty little secret?

07:26.423 --> 07:28.689
Well,
then maybe we should just be friends.

07:29.214 --> 07:30.291
Okay.

07:31.761 --> 07:33.328
Okay.

07:34.672 --> 07:37.765
There's just one problem with that.

07:39.201 --> 07:40.968
What?

07:59.888 --> 08:02.444
Now, I don't know about you,

08:03.382 --> 08:05.792
but I never kiss my friends like that.

08:17.537 --> 08:20.339
Really? Jack?
You're going to ignore her.

08:20.814 --> 08:22.709
I don't reward bad behavior.

08:22.744 --> 08:24.978
She can play fetch with somebody else.

08:25.013 --> 08:27.637
You're gonna hold a
grudge against a dog.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.183
No creature, great or small,

08:30.218 --> 08:32.618
mess with a man's fly fishing stuff.

08:34.188 --> 08:36.155
She just wants to be loved.

08:36.191 --> 08:39.491
I mean,
how can you resist this sad face?

08:39.527 --> 08:43.078
Easy. I just think about my stuff.

08:43.236 --> 08:44.763
I know you, you're a softie.

08:44.799 --> 08:46.999
It's only a matter of time
until he forgives you.

08:47.034 --> 08:48.934
Ooh, you wanna make a wager on that?

08:48.970 --> 08:50.502
Yeah, all right.

08:50.537 --> 08:51.870
I bet you twenty bucks

08:51.906 --> 08:53.739
you two are friends by
the end of the week.

08:53.774 --> 08:55.340
You're on.

08:55.829 --> 08:57.076
You're on.

09:00.547 --> 09:02.147
Get over here!

09:02.182 --> 09:03.681
Okay. Stop!

09:11.024 --> 09:12.390
No-no-no-no!

09:12.426 --> 09:13.891
Ugh!

09:15.895 --> 09:17.762
I give up.

09:17.797 --> 09:19.998
Is that little horse too much for you,
Adam?

09:20.033 --> 09:21.699
He's impossible.

09:21.735 --> 09:24.568
Every time I try to get close to him,
he runs away.

09:24.604 --> 09:27.338
Here. Let me try it.

09:33.147 --> 09:36.306
Hey pony. Hi.

09:36.749 --> 09:38.915
I'm not gonna hurt you.

09:38.951 --> 09:40.684
You're okay.

09:40.719 --> 09:42.353
Whoa.

09:44.357 --> 09:46.890
You know what,
I'm gonna give you a name.

09:46.925 --> 09:48.959
How about Monty? Hm?

09:48.994 --> 09:50.994
What do you think about that?

09:52.597 --> 09:53.964
Come on, Monty.

10:00.076 --> 10:01.738
See. I told you.

10:04.847 --> 10:07.738
Peter, I hope you got the
ticket I sent you to the party.

10:08.056 --> 10:09.679
And trust me,
you are not gonna wanna miss this.

10:09.714 --> 10:11.080
We haven't seen you for awhile

10:11.115 --> 10:12.682
So I really think you should be there,
okay?

10:12.717 --> 10:15.285
Call me back.

10:15.320 --> 10:19.693
Did you join the Hudson heritage
foundation's planning committee?

10:20.659 --> 10:22.257
Do I look like an 80-year-old woman?

10:22.293 --> 10:24.193
Then why are you making sure

10:24.228 --> 10:26.428
that everyone has a
ticket to their party?

10:26.463 --> 10:29.486
You sent one to Peter in Vancouver?

10:29.723 --> 10:31.100
I like parties,
I want everyone to be there.

10:31.135 --> 10:32.534
What's the big deal?

10:32.570 --> 10:37.371
You hate parties just as much as I do.
Try again.

10:40.239 --> 10:41.743
All right.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.315
Tonight the mayor of Hudson

10:46.350 --> 10:49.718
and you cannot breath a
word of this to anybody

10:49.753 --> 10:53.322
the mayor of Hudson is
gonna present our Lou

10:53.357 --> 10:55.656
with the Entrepreneur of the year award.

10:55.692 --> 10:57.192
You don't say.

10:57.227 --> 10:59.094
- No, you don't say.
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:59.129 --> 11:00.661
Right. Not a word.

11:00.697 --> 11:03.255
You know how hard it is
to keep a secret from Lou.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.266
I will say no more. It's...

11:05.301 --> 11:07.335
Your secret's safe with me.

11:07.370 --> 11:09.938
I wanted to call because
I didn't want him to have

11:09.973 --> 11:12.607
a matted coat over night
and I couldn't find Bob.

11:12.642 --> 11:14.275
That's him right here.

11:14.310 --> 11:16.877
Aww. Is he always off
on his own like that?

11:16.912 --> 11:20.151
Yeah. He doesn't really get
along with the rest of the herd.

11:21.351 --> 11:22.916
Hey Monty.

11:26.522 --> 11:27.955
I'm gonna have to convince
him to come to me,

11:27.990 --> 11:29.823
not the other way around.

11:29.859 --> 11:31.992
Why don't we take all these
other horses out of here.

11:32.027 --> 11:34.128
And then I can be alone with him.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.666
Hey llama boy!

11:39.701 --> 11:42.069
Nobody really calls me that anymore.

11:42.404 --> 11:46.706
Okay. I guess I'll just
call you an idiot then.

11:46.741 --> 11:48.240
Excuse me?

11:48.276 --> 11:50.209
Look, Georgie was really looking forward

11:50.244 --> 11:51.744
to going to the party with you tonight.

11:51.780 --> 11:53.646
I can't believe you're ditching her.

11:53.682 --> 11:55.114
My dad said I'm not allowed.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.083
So, use that oversized brain of yours

11:57.118 --> 11:58.985
to convince him you have to go.

11:59.020 --> 12:02.288
In case you haven't noticed,
Georgie really likes you.

12:02.323 --> 12:04.256
So stop messing it up.

12:12.633 --> 12:14.533
It's okay. You don't have to be scared.

12:16.604 --> 12:17.970
You can come.

12:22.153 --> 12:24.915
It's just you and me, bud.
You don't need to be scared.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.749
Hey.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.450
Easy.

12:32.486 --> 12:34.319
You're okay.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.288
Oh.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.891
He doesn't like his face being touched.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.694
You want me to take a look.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.196
Yeah.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.370
Hey... Hey.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.109
Easy now... Easy.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.880
Yeah. I'm feeling a lot of
sharp edges in his mouth.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.515
Oh, it's okay. Hey, it's okay.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.783
His teeth need to be floated.
I'm gonna go get my kit.

13:06.818 --> 13:08.185
Poor guy.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.053
Good thing you called us, Georgie.

13:10.088 --> 13:12.356
You must be in a lot of pain, huh?

13:12.391 --> 13:14.924
I'll get you fixed up. Yeah.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.282
Hello...

13:39.317 --> 13:41.517
You have something I need, Bob;

13:41.553 --> 13:44.461
private land and plenty of black bears.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.423
And I got something you need; money.

13:48.859 --> 13:50.293
So how about we let bygones be bygones

13:50.328 --> 13:52.793
and get things back to
the way they used to be.

13:52.872 --> 13:55.964
No. Look I told you my
poaching days are over.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.189
I'll pay you double
what I paid last year.

13:59.670 --> 14:02.705
Look, I don't kill animals. I save them.

14:02.740 --> 14:05.411
Think of all the animals you
can save with this money.

14:05.873 --> 14:08.186
All I'm asking for is a few bears.

14:09.613 --> 14:11.379
Go to hell.

14:12.058 --> 14:13.748
That's the wrong answer.

14:15.919 --> 14:17.252
H-hello?

14:27.893 --> 14:29.399
Don't look at me.

14:29.465 --> 14:32.068
Georgie is upstairs.
You go play with her.

14:32.570 --> 14:34.802
Go on! Get!

14:35.253 --> 14:36.904
Go on!

14:38.927 --> 14:40.487
All right.
So Lou is running a little bit behind.

14:40.553 --> 14:42.514
So we're gonna take Katie to
Vanessa's on our way to the party.

14:42.606 --> 14:44.346
Well, we better get a move on then.

14:44.381 --> 14:46.730
All right, let's get you a juice.

14:47.628 --> 14:51.316
Well, hello, young fellow. Come on in.

14:51.421 --> 14:52.584
Hi.

14:52.994 --> 14:54.223
Is Georgie here?

14:54.355 --> 14:57.225
Uh, she is upstairs changing.
She'll be down in a minute.

14:57.370 --> 15:00.476
But you can wait for
her in the living room.

15:00.951 --> 15:02.167
Thanks.

15:11.516 --> 15:14.067
I didn't think you were coming.

15:17.912 --> 15:19.578
Wow. I...

15:19.763 --> 15:24.002
I spent a year on the debate
team at my old school.

15:25.853 --> 15:26.989
Okay.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.328
A convincing argument just
needs a strong thesis.

15:29.421 --> 15:32.725
So I told my dad that this
event only happens once a year

15:32.764 --> 15:34.998
and that I really wanted to go with you.

15:36.215 --> 15:37.695
Plus I agreed to take out the garbage

15:37.734 --> 15:39.770
everyday for the next month.

15:41.726 --> 15:43.351
This is for you.

15:44.778 --> 15:48.439
Wow. Thank you. It's-It's beautiful.

15:51.979 --> 15:53.445
If you're going to
lock lips with someone,

15:53.480 --> 15:54.846
you could do a lot worse than Mitch.

15:54.882 --> 15:56.481
He's not exactly hard on the eyes.

15:56.517 --> 15:59.718
- Amy!
- What? I'm married, I'm not blind.

15:59.753 --> 16:02.621
No, I just mean don't encourage me.

16:02.656 --> 16:05.323
What if I'm having some kind
of early mid-life crisis?

16:05.358 --> 16:07.659
Or what if you actually like this guy.

16:07.694 --> 16:10.028
What if I do like him? What then?

16:10.063 --> 16:12.730
Then, you go on a date.

16:12.765 --> 16:14.999
And you figure it out from there.

16:15.035 --> 16:16.734
Yeah. What if Georgie finds out?

16:16.769 --> 16:18.803
Or dad, or grandpa?

16:18.838 --> 16:22.273
Look, Lou, you have got to
move on with your life, okay?

16:22.309 --> 16:25.576
And Grandpa understands that.
So does dad.

16:25.611 --> 16:28.279
Georgie... she'll get used to it.

16:28.315 --> 16:30.448
Uh, come in.

16:31.530 --> 16:35.319
Hi. Is it okay if Adam and I get
a ride with Jade to the party?

16:35.354 --> 16:37.120
Yeah, just dress warm.

16:37.156 --> 16:38.489
Yeah. Sure.

16:38.524 --> 16:41.258
And um, don't let Jade drive too fast.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.927
Okay.

16:42.962 --> 16:44.361
And Georgie...

16:45.797 --> 16:47.730
Yes, Lou...

16:47.766 --> 16:49.766
You look really pretty.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.168
Thanks.

16:51.203 --> 16:52.535
See ya.

16:52.571 --> 16:54.271
Well, I should get going.

16:54.306 --> 16:56.073
Hey,
why don't you drive in with me and Ty.

16:56.108 --> 16:57.841
Uh, no, no. I'm fine.

16:57.876 --> 17:00.577
Come on, otherwise you're gonna
walk into the party alone.

17:00.612 --> 17:03.646
I'm single now,
I walk into place alone all the time.

17:03.682 --> 17:06.449
Yes, but maybe now that
Mitch is in the picture,

17:06.484 --> 17:08.184
you don't have to.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.635
Hey, where's Lou?
Why isn't she here yet?

17:26.670 --> 17:28.104
She was running a little late. I know.

17:28.138 --> 17:29.538
She's on her way. I'm sure.

17:29.573 --> 17:30.939
Yeah. Well, she better hurry up.

17:30.975 --> 17:32.341
I just spoke to the mayor,

17:32.377 --> 17:33.742
and she wants to do that
thing that we talked about

17:33.777 --> 17:35.110
sooner than later.

17:35.145 --> 17:36.512
What thing?

17:36.547 --> 17:38.680
What thing?

17:38.716 --> 17:40.883
The mayor doing a thing? What thing?

17:40.918 --> 17:42.450
The things mayors do.

17:42.486 --> 17:46.926
Cut ribbons, raise property taxes...

17:47.355 --> 17:50.125
Lou is being presented with the
entrepreneur of the year award.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.626
Oh really?

17:51.661 --> 17:53.094
- Wow...
- Okay.

17:53.130 --> 17:54.496
That was supposed to be surprise!

17:54.531 --> 17:56.998
I'm sorry. I'm proud of her.
I can't help it.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.933
I won't tell a soul. I swear.

17:58.968 --> 18:01.236
Yeah, that's what he said.

18:06.248 --> 18:07.742
Ah, Lou, hey...

18:07.777 --> 18:09.476
I didn't think anybody was home.

18:09.512 --> 18:11.445
What are you doing here?

18:11.480 --> 18:14.015
Uh, Jack lend me these
cufflinks for the party.

18:14.050 --> 18:16.183
He just put them on the table here.

18:16.218 --> 18:18.019
You're coming tonight?

18:18.054 --> 18:20.655
Yeah, Tim had a couple of extra tickets,

18:20.690 --> 18:22.056
so he gave them to me.

18:22.091 --> 18:23.758
A couple of extra tickets.

18:23.793 --> 18:26.160
That mean, you're bringing a date?

18:26.195 --> 18:27.761
Some girl you met online whose
likes include pina coladas

18:27.796 --> 18:29.896
and getting caught in the rain?

18:29.932 --> 18:31.898
Would that bother you?

18:33.302 --> 18:35.302
No, of course not.

18:35.337 --> 18:37.071
I was just on my way out.

18:37.106 --> 18:39.506
So I guess I'll see you there.

18:41.142 --> 18:43.342
I'm not.

18:43.378 --> 18:44.945
What?

18:44.980 --> 18:47.113
Bringing anyone.

18:47.148 --> 18:51.441
It was kinda last minute,
so I'm going solo.

18:52.670 --> 18:55.814
What about you?
No chaperone to the dance?

18:55.924 --> 18:57.256
I was supposed to go with Georgie,

18:57.292 --> 18:59.024
but she got a ride with her friends.

19:00.495 --> 19:04.933
Well,
would it be against any of your rules

19:05.233 --> 19:08.033
if I gave you a ride to the party?

19:09.745 --> 19:11.952
No, I don't think so.

19:12.772 --> 19:14.473
Are you sure?

19:14.966 --> 19:17.820
If we show up together,
people might start talking.

19:19.213 --> 19:22.848
Well,
let's give them something to talk about.

19:29.323 --> 19:32.604
Tim, you need to relax.
Just a little bit.

19:32.692 --> 19:34.326
I can relax,
I will relax when Lou gets here.

19:34.361 --> 19:35.727
All right.

19:35.762 --> 19:37.762
So is Casey gonna come
by tonight at all.

19:37.797 --> 19:39.931
- No.
- Oh.

19:39.966 --> 19:41.699
She's at a rodeo.

19:41.735 --> 19:43.768
Wow, a lot of rodeos lately, eh?

19:43.803 --> 19:45.951
Yeah, well... She-she's a busy woman.

19:47.774 --> 19:49.206
There is Lou. Lou!

19:49.242 --> 19:50.675
Hey. You're here finally.

19:50.710 --> 19:53.044
Oh sorry,
I didn't realize I was that late.

19:53.079 --> 19:54.779
- Hey Tim.
- Hi Mitch, how are you?

19:54.814 --> 19:56.547
Did you two come together?

19:56.582 --> 19:58.750
Mitch was kind enough
to offer me a ride.

19:58.785 --> 20:01.085
Oh. Okay. Well, come in.

20:01.121 --> 20:03.854
- Come on, enjoy yourself.
- Hey.

20:08.394 --> 20:10.794
The temperature is gonna drop
to below minus 20 tonight.

20:10.829 --> 20:12.263
Never mind that. Your mom just walked in

20:12.298 --> 20:13.764
with that hot ranch
hand from your place.

20:13.799 --> 20:15.266
Who? Mitch?

20:15.301 --> 20:17.000
They're totally on a date.

20:17.036 --> 20:18.702
No. no. no. No way.

20:18.737 --> 20:20.103
Georgie's right.

20:20.139 --> 20:22.539
There's no actual evidence of a date.

20:22.574 --> 20:23.674
They could have car pooled or
just arrived at the same time.

20:23.709 --> 20:25.075
Right. Exactly.

20:25.110 --> 20:26.476
If you ask me,
your mom is helping herself

20:26.511 --> 20:28.845
to a delicious slice of hunky cowboy.

20:28.881 --> 20:30.520
Hi guys.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.716
Hello Mrs. Fleming-Morris.
You look radiant this evening.

20:32.751 --> 20:34.551
Wow. Thanks Adam.

20:34.586 --> 20:36.153
Are you guys having fun?

20:36.188 --> 20:39.021
Not really.
There's a lot of old people here.

20:39.057 --> 20:40.723
No offence.

20:40.758 --> 20:42.091
They just updated the temperature.

20:42.126 --> 20:44.126
It's gonna to be minus 30.
We need to go!

20:44.162 --> 20:46.262
Go where? The party just got started.

20:46.298 --> 20:48.398
There's a pen full of miniature
horses at the wildlife reserve.

20:48.433 --> 20:50.366
They're so tiny and it's
gonna be way too cold.

20:50.402 --> 20:52.802
We need to make sure
they have enough hay.

20:52.837 --> 20:55.104
Livestock create heat by
digesting high-fiber feed.

20:55.139 --> 20:56.538
If they don't have enough to eat...

20:56.574 --> 20:58.207
Thanks, Adam. I'm aware of that.

20:58.242 --> 21:00.176
Why can't Bob feed the horses?

21:00.211 --> 21:01.610
I just texted him.

21:01.645 --> 21:03.079
He's in Lethbridge picking up hay.

21:03.114 --> 21:05.047
He's not gonna be back
until after midnight.

21:05.083 --> 21:06.749
I don't know, Georgie.

21:06.784 --> 21:09.283
Please, we'll be super quick
and we'll come right back here.

21:09.353 --> 21:11.119
You won't even notice we're gone.

21:11.154 --> 21:14.956
Okay, if you guys are
back within an hour, okay.

21:14.992 --> 21:17.759
Give you plenty of time to
party with us old fogies.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.631
It's all about educating our clients.

21:22.666 --> 21:25.634
Anything that we can do to prevent
going out at midnight to pull a calf.

21:25.669 --> 21:27.034
No. I totally agree.

21:27.069 --> 21:28.436
We have to do way more
outreach on things

21:28.471 --> 21:30.004
like vaccine protocol
and basic herd health.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.406
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

21:32.442 --> 21:33.508
You know, I've been thinking that
maybe on our website or something

21:33.543 --> 21:35.580
- we can have like a resource page.
- Yeah.

21:35.607 --> 21:37.378
Put all this information on there,
you know.

21:37.413 --> 21:39.079
Excuse me,
I'm just gonna grab another water.

21:39.115 --> 21:40.515
Yeah. Okay.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.250
That's a great idea,
we should talk to Scott about that.

21:42.285 --> 21:43.784
Great.

21:43.819 --> 21:45.919
There's only so much
vet talk I can take.

21:45.955 --> 21:48.022
You're telling me.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.389
You lasted a lot longer than I did.

21:49.424 --> 21:50.824
- Water, please.
- Sure.

21:50.860 --> 21:53.426
Yeah.

21:53.462 --> 21:55.796
Spirit, he is quite the horse.

21:57.266 --> 21:58.966
He's something?

21:59.001 --> 22:02.169
He's definitely too much for Cassandra.

22:02.204 --> 22:03.736
I know.

22:03.772 --> 22:05.772
Then why did you buy him for her?

22:05.807 --> 22:07.207
I didn't.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.075
We were at an auction, Cass bid on him.

22:10.612 --> 22:12.979
Are you serious? Why would she do that?

22:13.014 --> 22:14.447
I don't know.

22:14.483 --> 22:16.248
She's never really showed much
interest in horses before.

22:16.284 --> 22:18.484
You know, outside of surgery.

22:21.189 --> 22:22.789
- Yeah.
- Sorry. Excuse us.

22:22.824 --> 22:24.724
- Cheers. Cheers.
- Well, sure.

22:24.759 --> 22:26.592
Excuse-excuse me.

22:28.529 --> 22:30.863
What exactly do you think you're doing?

22:30.899 --> 22:32.831
I don't know.

22:32.866 --> 22:35.434
I saw you, I saw a dance floor.

22:35.469 --> 22:38.470
I'm just making this up as I go.

22:44.545 --> 22:47.680
You're gonna get me trouble.

22:51.418 --> 22:52.984
Wow, you know,

22:54.554 --> 22:55.987
I don't think I told you this tonight,

22:56.023 --> 22:58.724
but you look beautiful.

23:01.128 --> 23:03.494
You don't look so bad yourself.

23:03.530 --> 23:05.430
Thank you.

23:08.668 --> 23:10.067
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:10.103 --> 23:11.802
- You made it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

23:11.838 --> 23:14.205
- Sorry I'm late.
- No. No, thanks for coming.

23:15.642 --> 23:17.108
All right.

23:20.280 --> 23:23.914
Yeah. Yeah. That's what
happens when you don't visit.

23:27.754 --> 23:31.455
- Um, would you excuse me?
- Yeah.

23:34.994 --> 23:37.962
Peter, what are you doing here?

23:37.997 --> 23:40.830
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah.

23:42.768 --> 23:44.434
What's going on?

23:44.470 --> 23:47.271
I need to apologize to you

23:47.306 --> 23:48.772
about what happened in Vancouver.

23:48.807 --> 23:50.173
Peter...

23:50.208 --> 23:53.176
No, you should never have
found out about Sylvia

23:53.211 --> 23:55.044
the way you did.

23:56.681 --> 23:58.514
Now is hardly the time, okay?

23:58.549 --> 24:01.151
Please Lou,
just- just hear me out, okay?

24:02.654 --> 24:04.788
Not being honest with you about Sylvia

24:04.823 --> 24:07.290
is just one of the many mistakes
I've made over the past year.

24:07.325 --> 24:10.708
But the biggest one by
far was leaving you.

24:10.748 --> 24:13.128
Peter, you didn't leave me.
We left each other.

24:13.164 --> 24:15.464
Okay. Well, then I should
have never let that happen.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.466
I love you, okay?

24:17.502 --> 24:20.135
I-I love you so much.

24:20.171 --> 24:21.671
And even after everything
that's happened,

24:21.706 --> 24:23.639
that hasn't changed.

24:27.812 --> 24:29.744
I uh...

24:32.449 --> 24:35.650
When I found these rings
in my condo after you left,

24:35.686 --> 24:39.188
I knew for sure that I did not
want this marriage to be over.

24:39.223 --> 24:41.990
And I know that it has taken
me way too long to say this

24:42.026 --> 24:43.758
but I'm here now and I'm telling you now

24:43.794 --> 24:47.061
I'm going to do everything
in my power to get you back.

24:48.164 --> 24:50.565
To get our family back together.

24:52.846 --> 24:55.236
What are you doing?

24:55.271 --> 24:57.372
Can you excuse me? I...

25:06.883 --> 25:09.383
Hey Tim.
We're all set to do the presentation.

25:09.418 --> 25:11.719
Okay. Fantastic.

25:11.754 --> 25:13.654
You know,
Lou is gonna be so excited about this,

25:13.689 --> 25:15.223
she has no idea.

25:15.258 --> 25:19.292
That's good,
but do you know where she is?

25:19.328 --> 25:22.095
Yeah, she's right back here with...

25:22.130 --> 25:24.130
Peter, where is Lou?

25:24.166 --> 25:25.566
I don't know.

25:25.601 --> 25:27.534
What do you mean you don't know?

25:27.570 --> 25:29.636
She left.

25:29.672 --> 25:32.841
She left? What did...

25:33.308 --> 25:34.975
What did you say to her?

25:35.010 --> 25:37.506
Not enough apparently.

25:43.184 --> 25:46.819
- No, Lou is totally not into him.
- Hm-hm.

25:46.855 --> 25:49.589
Guys look! Oh my God...

25:49.624 --> 25:52.291
Stop the car! Jade, stop the car!

25:52.326 --> 25:54.293
Okay. Okay!

25:58.632 --> 26:00.432
I'm calling the fire department.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.169
Miniature horses!
We have to go grab them!

26:10.308 --> 26:11.815
Come on!

26:14.084 --> 26:16.351
The Fire department's on their way.

26:22.525 --> 26:24.826
We have to get the horses
as far away as possible.

26:24.861 --> 26:26.260
The llama pen.

26:26.296 --> 26:27.662
- Come here, boy.
- Here, boy.

26:27.698 --> 26:29.064
Here, boy. Here.

26:29.099 --> 26:30.431
We've gotta get them out of here.

26:34.147 --> 26:36.037
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:37.707 --> 26:40.074
If I'm going to help you with Spirit,

26:40.109 --> 26:42.042
I need you to tell me the truth.

26:42.078 --> 26:44.245
He wasn't a gift from Caleb, was he?

26:46.416 --> 26:48.716
No. I bought him.

26:50.253 --> 26:52.286
I just don't understand why?

26:54.256 --> 26:57.124
Thought if I could learn how
to handle a horse like that,

26:57.159 --> 26:59.226
it would mean we weren't so different.

26:59.261 --> 27:01.294
I don't understand.

27:01.330 --> 27:04.124
Caleb's such a cowboy

27:04.322 --> 27:09.688
and I'm the opposite of a cowgirl.

27:11.206 --> 27:13.039
Every time we're out
with his rodeo friends,

27:13.074 --> 27:15.775
it's like I don't even exist.

27:16.961 --> 27:20.680
To be honest,
we don't really have a lot...

27:20.979 --> 27:23.483
No, we don't have anything in common.

27:23.913 --> 27:29.642
And I'm just afraid
we're not gonna to last.

27:51.445 --> 27:53.111
- Well, hi.
- Hi.

27:58.018 --> 27:59.485
Are you okay?

27:59.520 --> 28:00.886
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:00.921 --> 28:03.688
I just-I had to get out of there.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.826
You know,
sitting here like this kinda reminds me

28:07.861 --> 28:10.328
of your wedding day.

28:10.363 --> 28:11.930
You had a case of cold feet,

28:11.965 --> 28:14.364
you wouldn't come out of the truck,
remember?

28:14.483 --> 28:17.496
Maybe it wasn't cold feet.
Maybe it was a premonition.

28:17.668 --> 28:20.076
I mean, look at how things turned out.

28:20.327 --> 28:21.706
I should have just stayed in the truck.

28:21.741 --> 28:23.551
Nonsense.

28:23.657 --> 28:28.045
You think about all the good things
that have happened since then.

28:28.468 --> 28:30.315
Georgie and Katie.

28:36.122 --> 28:37.587
You know, back when I lived in New York,

28:37.623 --> 28:40.590
I used to have all these dreams.

28:40.626 --> 28:43.294
And none of them involved
being a single mom.

28:45.131 --> 28:48.632
And just when I-I felt like I
was starting to figure this out

28:50.087 --> 28:54.103
Peter shows up saying all the
things I wish he'd said a year ago -

28:56.208 --> 28:59.042
turning my world upside
down all over again.

28:59.077 --> 29:01.778
I'll tell you something.

29:01.814 --> 29:04.113
I would not want to meet the liar

29:04.149 --> 29:08.885
who says their life turned
out exactly how they imagined.

29:09.411 --> 29:11.855
Well, maybe you can't see
all the amazing things

29:11.890 --> 29:14.757
that you've accomplished, but I do.

29:15.192 --> 29:17.372
I see them everyday.

29:18.529 --> 29:20.396
Especially when I look into the faces

29:20.431 --> 29:24.284
of those two beautiful,
strong girls you're raising.

29:30.575 --> 29:36.273
Now... there is one heck of a
party going on in that hall.

29:36.381 --> 29:38.981
And it would be a real
shame if you to miss it.

29:39.016 --> 29:41.583
I don't think so, grandpa,
I just wanna go home.

29:41.618 --> 29:43.785
And do what?

29:43.820 --> 29:47.403
To sit around,
feeling sorry for yourself.

29:47.561 --> 29:49.358
What's the point in that?

29:50.861 --> 29:55.951
Besides, I wore my suit tonight
so I could feel handsome

29:56.030 --> 29:58.232
when I danced with you girls.

30:01.687 --> 30:03.104
What do you say;

30:03.378 --> 30:06.340
We go back in there and we get our
'party on'

30:06.376 --> 30:08.818
as Jade would say.

30:10.748 --> 30:12.981
I can't believe
you just said that.

30:17.753 --> 30:20.554
Let's go!

30:20.589 --> 30:21.989
You guys run!

30:22.025 --> 30:23.324
Come on!

30:23.359 --> 30:24.858
Come on! Let's go!

30:25.280 --> 30:27.561
Georgie run!

30:27.596 --> 30:29.563
Let's go! Let's go!

30:32.701 --> 30:34.735
- Guys, there is only five!
- What?

30:35.704 --> 30:36.937
We're missing one.

30:36.972 --> 30:38.972
It's Monty! I've gotta back and get him.

30:39.007 --> 30:40.340
He's still in there.

30:40.375 --> 30:42.509
- No. It's too dangerous.
- A little help here!

30:42.545 --> 30:44.411
Georgie don't!

30:50.953 --> 30:52.718
Monty!

30:53.291 --> 30:54.687
Monty!

30:57.959 --> 30:59.359
That doesn't make any sense.

30:59.394 --> 31:00.826
That's what she said.

31:00.862 --> 31:02.527
Please don't tell Cassandra I told you,

31:02.563 --> 31:05.346
I don't think she'd appreciate
me spilling the beans.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.367
I don't want Cass to be a cowgirl.

31:08.402 --> 31:09.869
I love her for who she is.

31:09.904 --> 31:11.771
Have you told her that?

31:11.806 --> 31:14.427
Hello and good evening.

31:15.180 --> 31:19.478
Every year the town council
recognizes a member of our community

31:19.513 --> 31:23.114
who embodies the spirit
of entrepreneurship.

31:23.150 --> 31:26.017
We've chosen this event
to present this award

31:26.052 --> 31:27.786
because tonight's recipient

31:27.821 --> 31:29.988
is the owner of two businesses

31:30.023 --> 31:34.125
that have preserved and
embraced our town's heritage.

31:34.161 --> 31:37.728
Hudson is only as strong as
the people who live here,

31:37.764 --> 31:40.898
and there is no stronger
member of our community

31:40.933 --> 31:43.746
than Lou Fleming-Morris.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.674
Not only is Lou a business owner,

31:50.709 --> 31:52.810
but she's also a mother,

31:52.845 --> 31:55.512
a community organizer, a blogger

31:55.547 --> 31:58.348
and for many of us that first
friendly face we see in the morning

31:58.383 --> 32:00.983
- when we order a coffee.
- That's right.

32:01.019 --> 32:03.186
It's my privilege as mayor

32:03.221 --> 32:06.823
to present this year's
entrepreneur of the year award

32:06.858 --> 32:09.359
to Lou Fleming-Morris.

32:09.394 --> 32:10.760
Come on up here, Lou.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.633
Thank you.

32:17.668 --> 32:19.401
Why don't you say a few words.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.537
Sure. Sure.

32:23.241 --> 32:26.432
Uh, I didn't expect this.

32:26.677 --> 32:28.311
You were very sneaky, dad.

32:32.082 --> 32:34.886
I uh... wow.

32:35.886 --> 32:38.420
I don't quite know what to say. Um...

32:46.530 --> 32:49.564
A very wise man recently told me

32:49.599 --> 32:51.566
that he wouldn't want to meet the liar

32:51.601 --> 32:55.436
who said his life had turned
out exactly as he had imagined.

32:55.472 --> 32:58.106
So I'm not going to lie,

32:58.141 --> 33:00.041
it's been a hard year.

33:01.444 --> 33:03.111
And what the mayor said isn't true.

33:03.146 --> 33:06.774
I'm not that strong, but my family is.

33:07.369 --> 33:08.916
And if I've accomplished anything

33:08.951 --> 33:10.997
it is thanks to their support.

33:13.402 --> 33:16.944
Nine years ago the best
decision I ever made

33:16.993 --> 33:19.260
was moving back to Hudson.

33:19.772 --> 33:22.062
And no matter where life takes me,

33:22.542 --> 33:25.332
no matter what my future holds,

33:31.225 --> 33:33.507
this place will always be my home.

33:33.542 --> 33:37.747
So, thank you for this. It means a lot.

33:48.390 --> 33:50.156
Monty! Where are you?

33:59.767 --> 34:01.100
Monty!

34:03.939 --> 34:06.205
Good boy! You're okay!

34:24.686 --> 34:26.483
Georgie.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.088
Georgie! Get up!

34:32.123 --> 34:33.757
Come on! You have to stand up.

34:33.792 --> 34:35.492
Stand up!

34:52.543 --> 34:53.842
Are you okay?

34:53.878 --> 34:56.077
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine!

34:57.646 --> 34:59.509
Thank you!

35:10.064 --> 35:12.193
Cass. Wait!

35:13.090 --> 35:14.762
I have an emergency call.
I really have to go.

35:14.798 --> 35:17.265
Okay. I-I-I...

35:17.663 --> 35:20.335
I like being on the circuit,
I like riding broncs.

35:20.370 --> 35:21.702
But do you know what I love?

35:21.738 --> 35:24.139
You're going to say something cheesy,
aren't you?

35:24.174 --> 35:27.008
Like how you like rodeo but you love me.

35:27.044 --> 35:28.943
Kinda took the wind out of my sails.

35:31.017 --> 35:32.642
Amy told you what I said, didn't she?

35:32.735 --> 35:34.149
I know like we don't
have a ton in common,

35:34.217 --> 35:36.183
but I don't need you to be a cowgirl.

35:36.219 --> 35:38.219
I love you for you.

35:38.254 --> 35:41.973
Well, I'm just trying to be
part of your world, Caleb.

35:42.567 --> 35:44.891
I know. And now it's my turn.

35:44.926 --> 35:46.626
So I'm gonna come with you on this call.

35:46.662 --> 35:49.429
I wanna be part of your world too.

35:49.465 --> 35:52.066
Okay. You know what?

35:52.634 --> 35:54.368
I've got a better idea.

35:54.403 --> 35:56.236
Why don't I take tomorrow afternoon off

35:56.271 --> 35:58.472
and we head over to
the car and truck show.

35:58.507 --> 35:59.906
You like cars, I like trucks.

35:59.941 --> 36:02.075
That's something, right?

36:02.110 --> 36:04.543
We can start there
and then we'll just...

36:04.579 --> 36:06.812
We'll figure out the rest as we go.

36:11.702 --> 36:13.186
But now, I really have to go.

36:13.221 --> 36:15.121
I know, I'm sorry.

36:25.666 --> 36:27.199
Let's check it. Thank you.

36:38.779 --> 36:40.745
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:40.781 --> 36:43.148
Congratulations. That was...

36:43.183 --> 36:44.582
that was quite the speech.

36:44.618 --> 36:46.684
Thanks...

36:46.720 --> 36:48.663
Listen Mitch,

36:49.756 --> 36:53.324
I had a really nice time
with you tonight, but...

36:53.359 --> 36:58.475
I don't think I can do this
whatever "this" is.

36:59.299 --> 37:01.365
You're breaking up with
me on our first date.

37:01.401 --> 37:04.969
Wow, that is-that's a new record,
even for me.

37:06.502 --> 37:08.273
I'm sorry.

37:08.641 --> 37:10.541
It's okay.

37:10.576 --> 37:13.677
I mean, you got two kids to think about.

37:13.712 --> 37:15.779
And an ex-husband.

37:15.815 --> 37:18.182
And a long list of rules of
what you're supposed to do

37:18.217 --> 37:20.717
and how you're supposed to do them.

37:22.601 --> 37:26.289
Promise me one thing,
Miss Entrepreneur of the Year.

37:26.325 --> 37:28.525
What's that?

37:28.561 --> 37:33.153
One of these days,
do something that makes you happy, okay?

37:33.404 --> 37:35.398
Hey, hi.

37:35.434 --> 37:36.833
I don't think we've met.

37:36.868 --> 37:39.074
I'm Peter Morris. Lou's husband.

37:40.638 --> 37:42.172
I'm sorry, you are?

37:44.142 --> 37:46.275
I'm just the ranch hand, man.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.213
Really? Peter?

37:51.784 --> 37:52.615
Really what?

37:52.650 --> 37:55.458
You're my ex-husband. Not my husband.

37:57.121 --> 38:00.590
Okay. Well, I'm-I'm hoping
to change your mind on that.

38:00.625 --> 38:02.424
You know what,
I can't even begin to tell you

38:02.460 --> 38:05.560
how monumentally bad your timing is.

38:06.484 --> 38:08.347
It's Jade.

38:09.418 --> 38:12.244
Where are you guys, I said one hour...

38:13.371 --> 38:14.703
What?

38:16.140 --> 38:18.297
Oh my god is she okay?...

38:18.942 --> 38:20.876
Yes. I'll be right there.

38:20.911 --> 38:22.443
- We have to go.
- What is it?

38:22.479 --> 38:23.912
It's Georgie. We gotta go.

38:33.112 --> 38:34.723
- Hi.
- There she is.

38:34.758 --> 38:37.392
- How you feeling?
- I'm fine.

38:37.427 --> 38:39.593
Please don't make a
big deal out of this.

38:39.629 --> 38:41.443
Why would I make a big deal

38:41.482 --> 38:43.297
out of my daughter running
headlong into a raging fire?

38:43.333 --> 38:44.732
I want to head back to the reserve

38:44.767 --> 38:46.134
and make sure the horses are okay.

38:46.169 --> 38:47.535
Absolutely not.

38:47.570 --> 38:49.865
No, the doctor said you
have to take it easy today.

38:49.997 --> 38:51.848
- But...
- No buts.

38:53.075 --> 38:55.943
- You listen to your mom.
- Fine...

38:58.313 --> 39:00.581
Besides, you know, your dad is in town

39:00.616 --> 39:02.550
and it'd be nice for you and Katie

39:02.585 --> 39:04.919
to go and spend some time
with him at the dude ranch.

39:04.954 --> 39:08.374
- Okay? Would that be fun?
- Yeahhhh!

39:19.803 --> 39:21.234
- Hey...
- Hey.

39:27.217 --> 39:29.542
I am so sorry, Bob.

39:29.959 --> 39:32.681
Yeah. Me too.

39:34.135 --> 39:35.548
I'm gonna go check on the horses.

39:35.584 --> 39:37.550
Yeah. Okay.

39:41.245 --> 39:42.976
So do you know what caused the fire?

39:43.095 --> 39:45.291
Cops said it was arson.

39:45.326 --> 39:48.427
I guess that's what happens when
you make a deal with the devil.

39:49.537 --> 39:51.031
What are you talking about?

39:51.321 --> 39:52.998
The poachers.

39:53.033 --> 39:54.467
But they're in jail.

39:54.502 --> 39:57.570
Yeah. And it was my testimony
that put them there.

40:00.668 --> 40:03.475
The guy the poachers used
to work for called me,

40:03.510 --> 40:05.510
said he was willing
to forgive and forget.

40:05.545 --> 40:08.293
All I had to do was get
back into business with him.

40:09.016 --> 40:11.850
As you can see he wasn't
too happy when I said no.

40:14.454 --> 40:17.255
- I'm calling the cops.
- No, no, no more cops.

40:17.290 --> 40:19.524
That's what got me here
in the first place.

40:19.559 --> 40:21.426
Bob, we gotta do something.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.894
I sent two of his guys to jail,
he burned down my clinic.

40:23.930 --> 40:25.296
We're even.

40:25.332 --> 40:28.466
If I keep going to the
cops this will never end.

40:28.502 --> 40:30.067
It's over.

40:31.504 --> 40:32.870
Let it go.

40:56.309 --> 40:59.710
I gotta give you credit
you don't give up, do you?

41:20.457 --> 41:23.100
Don't push your luck,
I'm not throwing it again.

41:42.821 --> 41:45.492
That's it. Yeah.

41:45.990 --> 41:47.590
You know, you're just as bad as Georgie.

41:47.626 --> 41:50.226
What do you mean?

41:50.261 --> 41:52.595
You are getting too
attached to this horse.

41:52.631 --> 41:55.765
I can't help it.
You see him? He's so cute.

41:58.169 --> 41:59.979
Yes, you are.

42:20.324 --> 42:21.723
Thank you.

42:44.448 --> 42:46.614
- Hi mommy!
- Hi, sweetheart.

42:46.649 --> 42:48.283
You guys having fun with your dad?

42:48.318 --> 42:50.918
Yeah. He's making hot chocolate
inside if you want some.

42:50.954 --> 42:52.687
Oh, I'm just dropping off some linens.

42:52.722 --> 42:54.221
Please mommy!

42:54.256 --> 42:55.690
Okay, I'll be right there.

42:55.725 --> 42:58.192
You guys go back inside. It's freezing.

43:03.700 --> 43:05.633
Hello Lou.

43:08.104 --> 43:10.004
Hi.

43:12.316 --> 43:13.707
Hey Lou!

43:13.742 --> 43:16.477
The girls are asking me if you're
coming inside for some hot chocolate.
