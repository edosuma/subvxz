WEBVTT

00:50.634 --> 00:53.345
- It's coming!
- Get ready!

00:54.513 --> 00:56.474
Go, man, go!

01:18.496 --> 01:21.791
Get it. Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.

01:45.564 --> 01:46.565
Help.

01:47.483 --> 01:48.526
He... He got me.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.361
He'll kill us all.

01:54.949 --> 01:55.908
Give me that damn thing.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.202
Get back!

02:29.358 --> 02:30.651
Shoot it! Shoot it now!

02:48.627 --> 02:49.628
No! No! No!

03:06.854 --> 03:07.730
No!

03:08.397 --> 03:10.733
No! No! No!

03:11.025 --> 03:12.610
No! No, please!

03:12.776 --> 03:14.278
No!

04:06.121 --> 04:08.207
You need to sacrifice everything
if you want to survive.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.000
Hmm.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.002
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...

04:13.462 --> 04:14.338
Mm.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.548
Yeah,
that's one way to go.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.218
You want a beer?

04:20.302 --> 04:22.429
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What are you, Hemingway?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.181
No. Is that real?

04:24.348 --> 04:26.392
- When did we cross the North Pole?
- An hour ago.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.811
Oh, my gosh. It's hard to keep track
in this thing.

04:28.978 --> 04:31.355
We shouldn't have to stay on clock
when moving through time zones.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.524
I mean, what is that?
Three continents in two days?

04:33.691 --> 04:35.859
If you count Berlin,
we were only there three hours.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.362
Yeah, we knew
that Inhuman call was a hoax

04:38.529 --> 04:40.072
as soon as we stepped foot
in that apartment.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.241
- Saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.

04:42.408 --> 04:44.785
Jokers, hungry for attention.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.454
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower,

04:47.621 --> 04:49.498
they'd be signing
the Sokovia Accords as we speak.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.253
- You should let me work on Lola.
- I warned you.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.630
- Everything in Lola is custom...
- Yeah, everything is custom.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.923
But it would be something to do.

04:58.090 --> 05:01.176
There's only so many times
a guy can win cash off you, sir.

05:01.427 --> 05:02.636
You got to stop calling me that.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.807
- We're being called back to HQ.
- They say why?

05:06.974 --> 05:08.892
We're not due for restock
for another ten days.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.352
No idea, they said it's classified.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.271
Oh, everything is, nowadays.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.774
All right.
We'll need full inventory.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.276
Medical, provisions, fuel cells,

05:17.443 --> 05:19.320
and make sure you tell the crew
they'll need to call ahead

05:19.403 --> 05:20.779
if they want off
our next deployment.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.115
<i>Agent Thomson, Agent James...</i>

05:23.198 --> 05:25.200
- Wonder what that's about.
- I don't know.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.244
It'll be good to see Fitz
and Simmons.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.747
- And May.
- Yeah.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.582
I think you look forward to that
more than I do.

05:52.603 --> 05:53.604
What was his mistake?

05:58.317 --> 05:59.693
You know I'm not gonna talk.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.446
He didn't anticipate your back kick,
opened himself up.

06:03.489 --> 06:05.240
His mistake was he tapped out.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.048
Piper.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.133
Okay, people!

06:23.300 --> 06:25.302
What, you've never seen
the biggest plane ever built before?

06:25.469 --> 06:27.638
Next pairing! On the mat!

06:30.224 --> 06:32.601
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.228
Only the Quinjet touched down.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.397
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.565
It was supposed to be even longer.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.818
- You know who called us in?
- I do.

06:42.361 --> 06:45.656
You?
Okay, now I know something's up.

06:46.115 --> 06:49.368
I got word from contacts
in law enforcement, Los Angeles.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.036
Two civilians were violently killed.

06:51.787 --> 06:54.957
"Mysterious burns, heads bashed in,
spine pulled out of his..."

06:55.958 --> 06:59.086
Many conflicting accounts
but all agree, it was odd.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.338
"Odd?" Isn't that our wheelhouse?

07:03.507 --> 07:05.926
Oh, he's right. Why call us in?

07:06.009 --> 07:07.428
We could be headed
to the scene right now

07:07.511 --> 07:09.596
to confirm the presence
of an enhanced person,

07:09.763 --> 07:12.516
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.

07:12.683 --> 07:13.642
We'll handle these on the fly.

07:13.809 --> 07:16.270
Didn't exactly
wanna send this out on the wire.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.064
May, you're not sharing again.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.150
Now would be a really good time
to share.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.318
The police also have another victim
in custody.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.112
Critical condition.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.621
Under sedation,
he mentioned seeing a girl,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.582
saying it was the one from the news.

07:37.708 --> 07:38.709
Quake.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.503
Which you didn't want to send
over the wire.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.338
You were pulled off Daisy's case.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.466
The Director thinks she slipped
through our fingers too many times.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.633
The Director thinks you let her.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.927
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.

07:49.094 --> 07:52.890
Well, in his infinite wisdom,
he says you're now forbidden to.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.308
But you're telling us this
because...

07:54.475 --> 07:55.851
In case we want to do something
about it.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.354
Look, I can bury this

07:59.521 --> 08:01.148
until the official police report
comes through.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.066
It'll buy us a few hours
of lead time.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.402
- Get to L.A., sniff around.
- Yeah.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.696
We have an active Inhuman asset
in Los Angeles

08:07.863 --> 08:09.072
that's due for a check-in
soon enough.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.407
That'll justify our presence there,

08:10.574 --> 08:12.659
but soon as the report's filed,
they'll pull us out.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.162
And the armed forces
will be sent in after her.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.371
With orders to kill.

08:17.873 --> 08:18.874
To kill?

08:19.041 --> 08:20.667
If she's responsible
for these bodies.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.545
- That's not Daisy's MO.
- The world knows her as Quake

08:23.712 --> 08:26.715
and Quake is an outlaw
who takes down banks and bridges.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.175
- Oh, come on, we both know...
- She's hunting...

08:28.258 --> 08:29.843
- ...she's tracking these fanatics.
- ...violent radicals.

08:29.927 --> 08:33.138
The Watchdogs, trying to take down
their funding, their escape routes.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.558
Regardless, you should fuel up
and get back up in the air. ASAP.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.559
Find her before the military
does something bad.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.312
Or Daisy does something worse.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.530
<i>Hey! Hey, stop right there.</i>

08:56.370 --> 08:57.412
How are we feeling today?

09:00.249 --> 09:03.043
I've been tracking weapon sales
and I know you were hired to steal one.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.170
You even jacked a big rig
to help carry it out.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.631
We were just paid
for a smash-and-grab job.

09:07.798 --> 09:09.091
Who was that hunting you?

09:10.801 --> 09:11.802
<i>Open the door!</i>

09:11.969 --> 09:13.512
He nailed me
but we almost got away.

09:13.679 --> 09:14.596
Who was it?

09:14.763 --> 09:18.475
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.

09:19.643 --> 09:22.145
But you're gonna give me a little bit more
if I'm gonna find him alive.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.440
Save him, please.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.900
Before he gets burned, too.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.777
You'll see your buddy again
once you heal up.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.655
- Just tell me what's...
- No. No.

09:32.990 --> 09:33.991
It's too late for me.

09:34.616 --> 09:38.996
They say when the Rider burns you,
he burns your soul...

09:41.873 --> 09:43.166
...and a soul can never heal.

09:53.844 --> 09:54.845
Stop right there!

09:58.557 --> 09:59.558
Hello?

10:01.143 --> 10:02.269
Hello?

10:02.894 --> 10:05.480
I hear my voice echo
but it sounds strange in my head.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.900
The detail is amazing.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.529
However,
I am three feet off the ground.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.115
<i>Wait, what? Hold on. Damn it.</i>

10:15.282 --> 10:19.244
<i>Uh... Well, I did adjust
the Y-axis earlier for some reason.</i>

10:19.411 --> 10:20.495
<i>What does that look like now?</i>

10:22.080 --> 10:23.081
Better.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.834
The CPU seems to be handling
the high poly-count.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.170
Textures are impeccable.

10:28.337 --> 10:29.963
We should build a place to get away.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.549
A meadow or a cottage somewhere.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.303
I wish it were ever this quiet.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.724
Direct current stimulation.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.435
Creates the other senses like touch
and taste but also takes feedback.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.312
So, I've just mapped
your brain's response...

10:45.479 --> 10:48.106
Response to the environment.
Of course.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.108
Dr Radcliffe came up
with the architecture?

10:50.275 --> 10:52.861
Yeah, yeah.
He calls it "The Framework."

10:53.028 --> 10:55.947
But all the transcranial apparatus,
that's all me.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.491
No, of course, you're brilliant too.
Of course.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.534
Yeah, because soon, you won't even
need the eye-wear or the ear-wear,

10:59.618 --> 11:00.702
because it'll all be inside
your head.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.663
So, May's strike team
will be able to train virtually,

11:02.829 --> 11:04.748
instead of May constantly breaking
their ribs.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.751
Hey, hey, hey.
Authorised personnel only, pal.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.169
No pass, no entry.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.421
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.340
They have more reason to be here
than you do.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.301
Lot of new faces.

11:16.468 --> 11:17.594
Good to see yours.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.472
Six weeks. That's a record.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.434
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.521
Special Advisor to the Director
in Science and Technology.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.897
Or SADIST.

11:29.064 --> 11:31.274
- They keeping you busy?
- With busy work, mostly.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.985
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art
lie detector tests.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.196
So, that's the cost of being
in the Director's inner circle.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.656
Yeah, he's paranoid
about what happened

11:37.823 --> 11:39.616
the last time S.H.I.E.L.D.
was government-run.

11:39.783 --> 11:43.036
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration
Monitoring Program.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.746
Or, WIMP.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.165
Hey, you should join us
because we're gonna go to Radcliffe's

11:47.332 --> 11:49.334
and watch the Aberdeen-Inverness
Caley Thistle League Cup final.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.170
Those are football teams.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.005
Not sure they are, turbo.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.842
Unfortunately, we have
to be wheels up in ten minutes, so...

11:58.260 --> 12:01.513
Okay, all right.
Well, it's strictly business then.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.266
Oh, yeah! New toys.

12:04.641 --> 12:07.227
The exploding pen
that you asked for.

12:08.019 --> 12:09.271
I can't imagine the use for that.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.273
Oh, you never wanted one?

12:13.442 --> 12:15.485
And for you, Direct...

12:17.821 --> 12:19.072
Agent Coulson.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.326
With new bells and whistles.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.162
And the directions will be there
when you boot it up.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.001
What's the assignment?

12:33.962 --> 12:34.963
It's classified.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.842
Right, everything is these days.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.224
Fitz, sadly, I'm...

12:46.391 --> 12:48.185
Yeah, you can't make
the match either.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.770
I have to finish my reports.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.689
I know, I get it. That's okay.

12:52.856 --> 12:56.109
It's just shame hardly get
to see each other.

12:56.485 --> 12:57.486
Any of us.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.447
Yes, well.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.700
At least it's better
than the friends we'll never see again.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.199
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.867
I mean, we loaded it on an 18-wheeler,

13:46.034 --> 13:47.828
we parked it in the warehouse
and we just left it.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.591
- Left it for who?
- The Chinatown crew.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.302
They set the job up
and were willing to pay big.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.267
Lies. Aryan Brotherhood working
with the Chinese...

14:10.433 --> 14:12.269
I swear! I swear, that's all I know.

14:13.812 --> 14:14.813
Where's this warehouse?

14:16.022 --> 14:17.607
I... I can't tell you that, man.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.610
I'd be looking to be mowed down
in the payback.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.612
Ones you didn't already kill.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.826
If you don't tell me,
you'll have to tell him.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.163
This guy's missing,
the rest are dead.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.790
Aryan Brotherhood.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.709
They're not my kind of brothers.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.753
They've been known to work
for cash, burglary, assault,

14:38.920 --> 14:40.922
sort of the value meal
of hired guns.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.967
They're suspected
in the recent theft of this big rig,

14:44.134 --> 14:46.511
probably prepping
for a larger score.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.013
A big, yellow, hard-to-hide,

14:48.179 --> 14:50.015
so, what are we looking
for this thing?

14:50.390 --> 14:51.975
And if Daisy's chasing
the same angle,

14:52.142 --> 14:53.852
maybe we get
to the finish line first.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.145
I'll greet her when she arrives.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.980
- Agent Coulson.
- Davis.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.148
Preparing for descent.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.025
Inhuman asset will be waiting
on the tarmac.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.279
What?

15:19.169 --> 15:20.795
How's your wife, Davis?

15:20.962 --> 15:21.963
Getting bigger every day.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.423
Oh, don't tell her that.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.966
More beautiful every day.

15:26.968 --> 15:27.969
There you go.

15:31.681 --> 15:32.682
Mack.

15:34.851 --> 15:35.852
Yo-Yo.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.481
I just have a few questions.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.983
- I'm all yours.
- Okay.

15:43.234 --> 15:46.154
Uh... So, I see you went to Colombia
for a week?

15:46.321 --> 15:47.280
Mm-hm.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.533
- And tickets to Miami coming up?
- Yes.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.662
Do you watch me sleep,
or shower, or...?

15:53.828 --> 15:55.330
Just procedure.

15:55.497 --> 15:58.124
You don't have to use a satellite
to get to know me better.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.710
Just ask me to dinner again.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.386
You know the rules about fraternising
with assets in the field.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.223
Oh, we haven't fraternised
anything yet...

16:14.099 --> 16:15.558
and I thought
you were breaking the rules

16:15.725 --> 16:18.103
coming to do my check-up early
just to see me.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.356
Or are you here because...
there's been a lot

16:21.523 --> 16:22.983
of little earthquakes lately?

16:23.525 --> 16:25.276
Daisy could be in the area.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.237
But, officially,
that's not the mission.

16:27.696 --> 16:28.863
It doesn't matter.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.533
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.661
What is the official mission?
Can I help?

16:35.453 --> 16:37.664
Well, here's
where I have to remind you,

16:37.831 --> 16:39.708
"By the Sokovia Accords
that you signed..."

16:40.917 --> 16:42.711
"...require approval
by the United Nations sub-committee"

16:42.877 --> 16:44.629
- "for an enhanced individual..."
- Rules. Rules. Rules.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.172
Blah, blah, blah.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.718
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now,
Turtleman.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.344
I prefer to move fast.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.096
Uh...

16:53.763 --> 16:55.515
Mack, they found the truck.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.352
Good to see you too, Coulson.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.566
Well, if you're in Miami,
look me up.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.571
Just because we can't work together,
doesn't mean we can't live a little.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.378
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.882
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?

17:29.299 --> 17:30.717
Yeah, she wanted to. Same story.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.595
All work and no play, huh?

17:33.762 --> 17:35.138
That's a bit disappointing.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.725
So, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just finishing cleaning up.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.983
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided,
don't you think?

17:47.150 --> 17:49.486
Their keeper's absolutely crap!
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.322
I'm so sorry, I had no idea
there was somebody here.

17:52.489 --> 17:53.490
Hello.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.659
You weren't meant to see that.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.369
Hello, I'm glad to final...

17:59.662 --> 18:01.122
Hello, I'm glad to final...

18:01.289 --> 18:02.290
Fitz, meet Aida.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.794
- Hello, I'm glad to final...
- She's crashed.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.339
Hello, I'm glad to final...

18:11.966 --> 18:13.635
Hello, I'm glad to final...

18:14.844 --> 18:16.429
Hello, I'm glad to final...

18:17.347 --> 18:18.765
Hello, I'm glad to final...

18:19.933 --> 18:21.351
Hello, I'm glad to final...

18:24.562 --> 18:25.605
What the hell?

18:26.397 --> 18:29.901
Well, I've just upped her PSU
to compensate for image processing.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.277
Must have over-cranked it on reboot.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.113
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.531
I meant...

18:36.074 --> 18:37.367
What the hell?

18:37.534 --> 18:39.702
Wait, you've already met Aida.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.872
Digital personal assistant
as a voice on the computer.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.207
So...

18:46.501 --> 18:48.628
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.256
I was just now
installing new hardware,

18:51.422 --> 18:53.967
updating her gyroscopic sensors.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.969
I'm not some sicko.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.512
When did you build this?

18:57.679 --> 18:59.514
Have you forgotten
the very strict stipulations

18:59.681 --> 19:00.682
that came with your pardon?

19:00.849 --> 19:03.560
You are not allowed experimentation
without approval and oversight...

19:03.726 --> 19:06.187
Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that. Yeah.

19:06.354 --> 19:09.107
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.

19:09.274 --> 19:12.193
Look, this has been a lifelong dream
of mine, Fitz.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.903
When I saw the work you
and Simmons were doing

19:13.987 --> 19:16.239
in replicating human tissue
and internal bone structure

19:16.406 --> 19:17.824
in Coulson's hand, I knew.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.868
I knew right then
that this was within reach.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.288
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.957
It's one that can cross
the uncanny valley

19:26.124 --> 19:29.169
and come out the other side.
Pass for human.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.422
I mean,
it has bloody micro-expressions...

19:32.589 --> 19:33.590
"She?"

19:34.757 --> 19:36.759
It's an... It's definitely a she,
because I saw...

19:37.218 --> 19:41.306
She has micro-expressions,
full range of motion.

19:41.514 --> 19:46.102
I mean, physically, it's...
she's nearly perfect.

19:46.269 --> 19:47.353
She is...

19:49.814 --> 19:50.940
very realistic.

19:51.774 --> 19:52.901
And mentally well.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.611
You've spoken with Aida.
She's bright.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.946
She laughs at the jokes,
I've programmed her to recognise,

19:57.155 --> 19:59.157
but she's never going to pass
the Turing test.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.491
At the moment,
that's a pipe dream.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.744
However, I think, with your help...

20:02.911 --> 20:05.163
No, no, no, no, no.
We have to report this right away.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.581
You could lose everything.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.583
- I know, I know.
- Or you could go to jail.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.044
I know! I know. You're right.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.381
Full disclosure at this time,
it's the best course of action.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.799
I... I agree.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.054
Hm.

20:21.429 --> 20:22.931
At least let me show you
how it works.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.452
They're in town.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.497
I suppose you guessed that.
Texting me.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.499
They're looking for a truck.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.294
That mean you have something for me?

20:53.461 --> 20:57.173
They watch my every move,
but certain moves they can't see.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.926
Can't get these over the counter.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.095
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue
for rapid bone-healing, yes?

21:02.303 --> 21:05.682
I know you splintered your bones
when you first powered up.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.393
- You're pushing yourself too hard.
- Don't worry about me.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.228
You can't use your powers too much.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.230
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.819
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.

21:17.986 --> 21:20.238
Are you still hunting
those <i>perro rabiosos?</i>

21:21.197 --> 21:22.532
It's not just the Watchdogs now.

21:23.449 --> 21:27.787
Local gangs have been working
for them, which I don't understand.

21:28.413 --> 21:30.248
I was tracing the sale
of a weapon and I...

21:31.374 --> 21:34.168
I think I may have stumbled
upon a serial killer.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.878
Ooh, fun.

21:36.879 --> 21:37.964
He live around here?

21:38.131 --> 21:41.551
He mostly hits this area
but he's hard to track down,

21:41.718 --> 21:43.636
leaves no traces behind,
operates alone.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.179
Sound familiar?

21:45.346 --> 21:47.765
I thought maybe you
were growing roots, Daisy.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.059
L.A. used to be where you hang out,
no?

21:50.226 --> 21:51.227
No roots.

21:53.521 --> 21:56.232
Everyone gets attached
to something eventually.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.905
Don't forget to wait two stops
after I get out off.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.198
Yeah, yeah, hey.

22:05.450 --> 22:06.993
Send me a picture of this guy.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.495
Maybe I can cover some ground
and I know how he looks like.

22:09.579 --> 22:11.247
No, I still haven't got
a good look at him yet,

22:11.331 --> 22:14.334
so just take care of yourself, okay?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.252
But thank you
for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.629
They won't give up on you.

22:19.005 --> 22:22.258
Especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.511
Well, that's too bad,
because there's only one thing I want.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.181
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Nothing to lose.

22:34.645 --> 22:37.148
Here's the mapping-action
eye-wear you requested.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.400
Should help your team in case
of a blind take down.

22:40.443 --> 22:41.361
Great. Thanks.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.279
I need you to sign for it.

22:45.114 --> 22:48.618
I don't get the new colour-coded
security level rainbow of...

22:48.785 --> 22:50.620
- What's it called?
- The Spectrum of Security.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.288
Why do I, Level Red,
have to go through you,

22:52.455 --> 22:55.124
Level Orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't Red be higher than Orange?

22:55.291 --> 22:58.294
Well, Orange encompasses
both Red and Yellow, so...

22:59.796 --> 23:02.382
It's hard to explain, but the Director
didn't want to use numbers,

23:02.548 --> 23:04.509
because he didn't want
any team member to feel less than.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.594
But you do have
a higher clearance than me.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.137
Only in most instances.

23:09.931 --> 23:11.015
I feel less than.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.355
Hey, we just had a report come in.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.108
A death in a hospital
in Los Angeles.

23:20.274 --> 23:23.236
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.406
- You think it might be Daisy.
- I'm going to look into it.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.698
I just wondered
if you'd heard anything

23:27.865 --> 23:29.325
from your law enforcement contacts.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.078
I'm mostly in the dark these days.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.789
Why don't you ask the Director?

23:35.289 --> 23:38.376
Since you're one of the few people
allowed or willing to do that.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.262
What you got there?

23:50.680 --> 23:51.806
You didn't hear?

23:52.098 --> 23:53.558
The word
is he hit again last night.

23:53.766 --> 23:54.851
Two dead in the street.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.980
- Who?
- The Ghost Rider.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.107
You must not be from around here.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.734
Do you know where I can find him?

24:03.818 --> 24:05.027
Nobody does.

24:05.194 --> 24:07.780
Everybody that sees his face
ends up on this wall.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.204
Everyone gets attached to something.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.129
You got to get
this truck out of here.

24:23.713 --> 24:24.922
Uh-oh. What the hell?

24:26.549 --> 24:27.800
What are you? The Feds?

24:27.967 --> 24:30.136
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.

24:30.303 --> 24:31.721
Not for long I hope.

24:31.888 --> 24:33.723
I'm just gonna have this guy tow
this thing away,

24:33.890 --> 24:35.892
so me and my crew
can get back to work.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.059
We got this.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.814
This warehouse usually sits empty.

24:41.898 --> 24:43.649
We were going to store
some inventory today.

24:44.108 --> 24:47.820
Found the lock broken
and this big hunk of thing inside.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.906
- Have at it.
- Thank you.

25:02.210 --> 25:03.377
Not fair.

25:03.544 --> 25:04.921
You want tech like this?

25:05.087 --> 25:06.506
You should've cut off your own hand.

25:08.549 --> 25:09.550
Mack.

25:15.306 --> 25:16.432
Okay.

25:21.729 --> 25:24.357
Looks like these guys
tore each other apart.

25:28.903 --> 25:31.489
"Xan-Wei,
resident of Monterey Park."

25:31.656 --> 25:32.740
Organ donor.

25:32.907 --> 25:35.243
Said anything about him
being a flesh-hungry rage monster?

25:35.409 --> 25:37.245
No, I'm not seeing anything
about that here,

25:37.411 --> 25:39.247
so we have to assume
that he wasn't

25:39.413 --> 25:41.541
until he came in contact
with whatever's in that trailer.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.834
Not much here
that'll lead us anywhere.

25:48.631 --> 25:50.883
Well, there's that.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.403
There's no buyer there.

26:20.329 --> 26:23.165
No! No! No, please! God, no!

26:23.332 --> 26:25.001
No! I don't deserve to die!

26:25.167 --> 26:26.836
- No! No!
- Everyone says that.

26:27.295 --> 26:28.713
No! No!

26:31.757 --> 26:33.259
Yeah, those Chargers
are hard to find.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.220
Between our <i>Fast and Furious</i>
and <i>Dukes of Hazzard,</i>

26:36.387 --> 26:37.722
they wrecked a lot of them.

26:37.888 --> 26:39.640
My boyfriend wrecked
his in a street race.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.058
He's pretty broken up.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.185
I guess he was more attached
to it than I thought.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.646
I ain't seen none
around here though.

26:45.813 --> 26:48.107
- Sorry.
- All right. Thanks, man.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.486
Hey, most of them
wrecked movie cars,

26:53.321 --> 26:54.989
they're dumped
at Almontie Junk and Salvage.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.450
If your boyfriend
wants to fix his ride up,

26:57.617 --> 26:59.910
he might want to go over there,
find scraps.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.705
Thanks, maybe he'll go there.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.082
<i>Daisy's in Los Angeles.</i>

27:05.249 --> 27:07.168
There was an eyewitness, now dead.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.629
And I just received Yo-Yo's check-in
report a week early,

27:09.795 --> 27:11.047
which means Coulson
and Mack are there, too,

27:11.213 --> 27:13.049
no doubt,
trying to track Daisy down.

27:13.215 --> 27:14.467
- Sounds right.
- You know it is,

27:14.634 --> 27:15.635
because according to the logs,

27:15.801 --> 27:18.179
you called Coulson back to HQ
for resupply yourself.

27:18.346 --> 27:20.139
Why, if not to give him
that intel in person,

27:20.306 --> 27:21.557
knowing it's against
the Director's order?

27:21.724 --> 27:23.267
I didn't send them,
I don't have the authority.

27:23.434 --> 27:24.477
They acted on their own.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.437
You knew I'd find out.

27:26.604 --> 27:28.606
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.358
- That's why.
- And now, I have to report it,

27:30.524 --> 27:33.110
which means, now,
I either look like I'm incompetent

27:33.277 --> 27:34.278
or colluding with you.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.405
I wouldn't want you falling out
of favour with the Director.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.368
Okay, I get it.
It's abundantly clear

27:40.451 --> 27:41.786
you're uncomfortable
with my new posi...

27:41.911 --> 27:44.163
I just want to know
how comfortable you are with it.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.499
You actually trust this guy?

27:46.666 --> 27:48.417
Our team split up
to lead departments,

27:48.584 --> 27:51.337
given different colours.
Because we're experts? No.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.506
I think the Director broke up
the band on purpose.

27:53.673 --> 27:54.840
Of course, he did!

27:58.552 --> 27:59.929
As soon as Talbot gave the locations

28:00.096 --> 28:02.014
of this base to the president,
things changed.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.600
I knew we'd be divided, undermined,
kept in the dark.

28:04.767 --> 28:07.853
So, I have been clawing for as much power
as I can possibly grab

28:08.020 --> 28:10.147
to keep a modicum
of control over any of this.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.401
After all we've been through.

28:20.574 --> 28:23.452
I don't trust the new Director
but he trusts me.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.162
So now, in order to keep that trust,

28:25.329 --> 28:28.457
I must take the appropriate action
to address this break in protocol.

28:29.625 --> 28:30.876
I'm sending you
and your strike team

28:31.043 --> 28:33.587
to take Coulson and Mack out
of the field, by force if necessary.

28:34.547 --> 28:35.798
Clean up whatever mess he's in.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.550
That's an order.

28:38.968 --> 28:39.969
Yes, ma'am.

28:48.102 --> 28:50.438
Place them at the four corners,
the exterior of the building.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.273
That will give us visuals
through the walls.

28:55.359 --> 28:57.153
<i>This could be very dangerous.</i>

28:58.362 --> 28:59.488
So much could go wrong.

28:59.655 --> 29:01.574
Ultron. Yes, I know.

29:01.907 --> 29:02.950
But this is not AI.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.368
AI is banned and that's good.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.829
This is mimicry of human behaviour.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.330
Still, in the wrong hands.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.332
This could be used as a weapon.
Is that the idea?

29:10.499 --> 29:13.252
No, absolutely not.
No, look. I know the dangers.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.797
That's why I've been...
reticent to divulge.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.800
I don't know these new people
at S.H.I.E.L.D....

29:20.551 --> 29:22.928
but a weapon
is absolutely not the idea.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.346
Well, then why? What's she for?

29:26.015 --> 29:27.683
Why not let Aida tell you herself.

29:37.526 --> 29:38.527
Hello.

29:40.237 --> 29:42.490
I'm glad to finally shake your hand,
Leopold.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.291
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.

29:53.793 --> 29:57.087
She's... indisposed, I'm afraid.

29:58.088 --> 29:59.089
Aida.

30:00.549 --> 30:02.426
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?

30:05.387 --> 30:08.265
I was wondering
if you could tell me...

30:08.766 --> 30:10.726
exactly what it is you are designed for?

30:14.772 --> 30:15.815
Of course.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.608
Dr Radcliffe, time and again,

30:17.775 --> 30:20.361
has expressed
his deep regret for causing pain,

30:20.528 --> 30:23.030
when all he ever wanted
was to prevent it.

30:23.405 --> 30:24.740
He speaks often of the pain

30:24.907 --> 30:26.951
that you and Agent Simmons
have had to suffer,

30:27.117 --> 30:29.036
having lost so many friends.

30:29.578 --> 30:32.706
Lincoln Campbell, Andrew Garner,
Antoine Triplett...

30:32.873 --> 30:34.583
Okay, stop it. Stop.
You don't have to list them.

30:36.085 --> 30:37.086
Sorry.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.965
The hope is that I will be able
to prevent future tragedies.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.424
Save the lives of agents

30:42.591 --> 30:45.678
by putting myself
in harm's way, in their place.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.263
- To kill?
- No.

30:48.264 --> 30:49.557
I am incapable of that.

30:49.723 --> 30:50.975
I will protect.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.811
I will serve as a decoy target.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.229
A safeguard.

30:56.897 --> 30:57.898
A shield.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.276
Okay. Turn her off.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.122
We can't tell Simmons about this.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.000
What?

31:17.543 --> 31:19.378
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...

31:19.461 --> 31:20.880
No, it's too dangerous
to show the new director.

31:20.963 --> 31:22.172
We don't know what he'd do with her.

31:22.256 --> 31:23.674
And she would have to tell him,
so...

31:25.718 --> 31:26.719
She can't know.

31:29.430 --> 31:32.141
- Not until...
- Until?

31:34.059 --> 31:35.269
Until she's perfect.

31:52.995 --> 31:53.996
<i>They're walking in now.</i>

31:54.163 --> 31:56.999
Six really convivial-looking
fellows.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.459
At least four of them are packing.

31:58.626 --> 32:00.878
We should be tapped
into surveillance now.

32:01.045 --> 32:02.087
Let's see what we get.

32:13.974 --> 32:15.184
Where are the other two men?

32:16.852 --> 32:18.228
We had to leave them
at the pickup site.

32:18.646 --> 32:19.521
Explain.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.984
Those guys were transferring the box
to the armoured transport.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.070
Maybe they peeked inside
or something,

32:26.236 --> 32:28.197
but they went berserk
and tore into each other.

32:28.364 --> 32:30.240
There's blood everywhere.

32:30.407 --> 32:32.952
We put two bullets in each of them
and locked them in the truck.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.663
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out!

32:35.829 --> 32:36.997
We had to get out of there!

32:38.999 --> 32:41.460
Did you burn the bodies or dump
the truck in the ocean?

32:43.337 --> 32:46.382
Because if not,
they can be traced back here.

32:50.010 --> 32:52.513
They probably saw
what was in this box.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.682
And were fighting over it,
you idiot!

32:59.103 --> 33:01.313
I've been told,
it's powerful enough

33:01.480 --> 33:04.233
to bring our new enhanced enemies
to their knees.

33:08.278 --> 33:10.698
We get on comms
and call the Zephyr for backup.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.616
Headquarters will know
we're on Daisy's trail.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.159
And they'll order us to pull out.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.453
She's been tracking this sale,
she could show up here any minute.

33:16.620 --> 33:19.164
- I don't know.
- Let's let this play out.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.708
See if anyone else
makes an appearance.

33:41.895 --> 33:42.896
Excuse me?

33:49.319 --> 33:51.071
Uh... Yard's closing.

33:51.655 --> 33:54.283
To sell a junker, you can call
the number on the gate.

33:54.450 --> 33:55.993
Oh, no, I'm not here for that. I...

33:56.785 --> 33:59.371
- Sorry. What's your name?
- Robbie.

33:59.538 --> 34:04.084
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy
with a sweet, black '69 charger.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.211
Maybe he bought some parts here.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.464
Sorry, doesn't ring a bell.

34:09.757 --> 34:11.132
I only work nights, once a week.

34:12.176 --> 34:14.511
Uh. Well, maybe I'll come back
in the morning. Thank you.

34:17.639 --> 34:18.639
Or...

34:19.516 --> 34:21.685
there's a book of sales you can flip
through in the main office.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.313
Not really an office.
More of a trailer...

34:26.356 --> 34:27.608
but I can show you.

34:27.983 --> 34:29.568
That would be great. Thank you.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.009
- The hell?
- What was that?

34:55.928 --> 34:57.513
A breath of fresh air.

35:09.817 --> 35:11.527
Get away from me!

35:14.822 --> 35:15.823
That's it there.

35:19.076 --> 35:20.828
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.288
I'm just in town for a couple of days,
soaking up the sun.

35:24.123 --> 35:25.958
Strange place
to spend your vacation.

35:29.586 --> 35:30.671
Not a great neighbourhood.

35:42.850 --> 35:46.562
So, you've got
the devil inside you, too?

35:54.611 --> 35:55.612
What's going on, guys?

36:02.786 --> 36:04.580
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.415
These guys might kill somebody
besides each other.

36:06.582 --> 36:07.666
Yeah, us.

36:07.833 --> 36:10.711
Z1, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.

36:15.257 --> 36:16.258
That was efficient.

36:27.436 --> 36:28.437
You guys know what to do.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.115
Damn.

36:42.284 --> 36:43.285
All clear.

37:10.479 --> 37:11.563
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.732
Serial killers always complain
when you try to intervene.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.026
I only kill <i>asesinos</i> who deserve it.

37:16.193 --> 37:17.694
It's vengeance, <i>chica.</i>

37:17.861 --> 37:19.863
For what?
You killed a detective.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.949
Well, he had blood on his hands.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.576
A teacher.

37:25.118 --> 37:26.203
A paedophile.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.001
You don't get to decide
who deserves to die.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.422
I'm not the one who decides.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.799
Do it.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.426
I deserve it.

38:26.555 --> 38:27.556
Do it.

40:05.654 --> 40:06.655
Hey.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.329
Thanks for the ride, Janet.

40:19.668 --> 40:20.877
Never accept rides.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.046
Bus break down?

40:23.505 --> 40:25.465
Or you still trying to holler
at Janet's little sister?

40:26.591 --> 40:27.676
Maybe.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.845
I only needed a ride
to help Canelo balance the books,

40:30.011 --> 40:32.639
because my brother
didn't finish high school.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.560
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.

40:52.868 --> 40:54.536
Everyone's attached to something.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.350
Spend a lot of time in here?

41:17.851 --> 41:20.645
Too much. My wallet's starting
to get sick of it.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.609
Your little side mission
didn't go unnoticed.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.402
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.

41:28.945 --> 41:31.239
The Director will want to have words
with you at HQ.

41:36.953 --> 41:38.997
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.

41:39.915 --> 41:42.459
But she was tracking these guys,
so maybe this is a win.

41:42.626 --> 41:43.793
I don't know.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.546
The ground team is checking
for contagion.

41:46.713 --> 41:48.423
But hopefully, whatever messed
with these guys' heads

41:48.590 --> 41:49.925
is no longer an issue.

41:50.091 --> 41:51.801
We're going to analyse
the box it came in.

41:58.433 --> 42:01.102
It's good.
To have a moment, just us.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.606
It's been a long time
since we had a moment alone.

42:08.485 --> 42:10.904
- You okay?
- Yeah.

42:11.821 --> 42:13.281
Just long day.

42:13.615 --> 42:15.909
Well, take advantage
of the downtime.

42:17.118 --> 42:18.703
Who knows what tomorrow holds.
