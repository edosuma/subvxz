EVEREST: <i>"Pups Save a Teeny Penguin."</i>
Synchronized by <font color=#00FF00>srjanapala</font>

00:53.685 --> 00:56.317
(Penguins squawking)

00:56.490 --> 00:58.852
Here we are, Jake: Chilly Cove.

00:58.927 --> 01:01.686
Best place for penguin
watching... ever!

01:01.753 --> 01:04.864
And once we start feeding 'em,
even more penguins

01:04.950 --> 01:07.243
will show up for us to watch.
Aa Ha!

01:07.322 --> 01:09.376
Hey! Little penguin dudes,

01:09.470 --> 01:13.056
come and get some
fresh fishy treats.

01:13.213 --> 01:15.876
(Penguins squawking)

01:15.922 --> 01:17.239
PU!

01:17.978 --> 01:20.532
And the penguins,
that means "yum."

01:20.629 --> 01:22.922
(Penguins squawking)

01:23.017 --> 01:26.228
(Laughing)
We're coming! We're coming!

01:26.360 --> 01:29.932
(Penguins squawking)

01:30.007 --> 01:35.036
Looks like we've got
a penguin party. Uh-oh.

01:39.453 --> 01:40.843
(Penguin squawking)

01:40.890 --> 01:43.929
What's wrong, Everest?
Need a pup-size clothespin?

01:44.029 --> 01:48.546
No, Jake, that baby penguin
must be stuck on that island.

01:48.687 --> 01:52.154
I don't think the poor little
guy knows how to swim yet.

01:52.249 --> 01:54.335
Too bad penguins can't fly.

01:54.452 --> 01:56.664
We gotta bring that
little waddle over here

01:56.718 --> 01:58.320
to where the treats are.

01:58.345 --> 01:59.405
Hmm...

01:59.452 --> 02:02.460
Hey, I think I know
just how to do it.

02:03.359 --> 02:05.421
Yeah, that's it, Everest.

02:05.491 --> 02:07.327
Pull a little tighter.

02:07.398 --> 02:08.507
Perfect.

02:08.570 --> 02:10.859
You know, if I hadn't
been a snowboarder,

02:10.945 --> 02:14.577
I totally could have been
Jake the building dude.

02:14.679 --> 02:17.599
Um, so, what is it?

02:17.671 --> 02:21.382
JAKE: It's a floating bridge
made out of our snowboards,

02:21.499 --> 02:25.695
canoes and everything else
we brought with us.

02:26.727 --> 02:28.500
It's a little wobbly,

02:28.570 --> 02:31.838
but now Waddle has a way to
walk over and get his lunch.

02:31.913 --> 02:34.663
Okay, little dude,
come on over the bridge.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.108
EVEREST:
One flipper at a time.

02:36.183 --> 02:37.536
JAKE: You can do it! Come on.

02:37.611 --> 02:40.878
Maybe we need to
show him what to do.

02:42.699 --> 02:46.646
See? Just waddle
across it, like this.

02:46.739 --> 02:52.329
Awesome penguin waddle, Everest.
Hey, check mien out.

02:53.275 --> 02:55.445
(Penguins laughing)

02:59.838 --> 03:04.626
It's working.
A few more waddles... whoa!

03:04.701 --> 03:06.495
Abandon bridge!

03:06.570 --> 03:08.993
Hurry, Waddle!
(Squawking)

03:09.149 --> 03:12.372
I gotcha, little penguin dude!

03:12.447 --> 03:13.102
Oops.

03:13.177 --> 03:17.247
We should have
called you "Slider."

03:17.648 --> 03:20.270
Come on,
we've got to get to shore.

03:20.345 --> 03:21.110
Oh, no!

03:21.185 --> 03:23.768
The penguins have our paddles.
We can't row back!

03:23.862 --> 03:26.737
And now way we could
swim in that icy water.

03:27.034 --> 03:29.590
(Phone beeping)

03:30.726 --> 03:33.687
So cute!

03:33.762 --> 03:35.768
How's the butterfly
watching going, pups?

03:35.881 --> 03:37.405
I just found a yellow one.

03:37.511 --> 03:39.231
I saw an orange one!

03:39.337 --> 03:40.967
There's a green one.

03:41.050 --> 03:43.264
No, wait.
That's a leaf.

03:43.339 --> 03:46.260
But there's one.
Come here, butterfly!

03:46.335 --> 03:47.393
Whoa!

03:47.468 --> 03:49.190
I got this.
(Barking)

03:49.265 --> 03:50.786
Net!

03:52.350 --> 03:54.389
Uh-oh.

03:56.748 --> 03:58.089
(All laughing)

03:58.164 --> 04:00.158
(Communicator ringing)

04:00.357 --> 04:01.926
Hi, Jake.
Who's your buddy?

04:02.001 --> 04:03.572
<i>Uh, we're calling him Waddle,</i>

04:03.647 --> 04:05.170
<i>and he needs the PAW Patrol.</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:07.705
<i>We all do, Ryder.
Jake rigged up a bridge</i>

04:07.786 --> 04:09.856
<i>so Waddle could get
to the fish treats,</i>

04:09.931 --> 04:12.483
<i>but then an ice floe
bumped it loose.</i>

04:12.558 --> 04:13.859
<i>And now we're stuck on it.</i>

04:13.961 --> 04:16.281
<i>And</i> we're <i> headed</i>
<i>out to the icy...</i>

04:16.356 --> 04:17.995
<i>Hey!
Sea.</i>

04:18.070 --> 04:21.375
Chill, guys.
Um, I mean, don't worry.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.187
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

Whoa!

04:35.617 --> 04:39.352

04:39.938 --> 04:41.220
Look out, Marshall!

04:41.295 --> 04:43.353
RUBBLE: Careful! Look out!

04:43.445 --> 04:45.216
(Crashing)

04:46.157 --> 04:47.456
Look.
(Chuckling)

04:47.540 --> 04:51.542
That butterfly just caught a
rare flatnose spotted Marshall.

04:51.617 --> 04:54.634

04:54.709 --> 04:56.636

05:24.827 --> 05:25.650
<i>Whoa!</i>

05:25.725 --> 05:29.085

Rocky...
(Beeping)

05:30.445 --> 05:32.175
I need you to use your tugboat

05:42.132 --> 05:44.830
There's lots of icebergs,
so you'll be in the water,

05:44.905 --> 05:46.392
steering the bridge around them.

05:46.467 --> 05:50.056
Ooh, chilly, but let's dive in!

My boat stopped going forward.

08:25.620 --> 08:27.880
Something's
pulling us backwards.

Hey, Waddle,

Whirlpool!

08:43.818 --> 08:46.052

down to the floating bridge.

<i>(Barking)</i>

09:17.510 --> 09:20.295
<i>do you think your tugboat can
get away from the whirlpool?</i>

09:20.404 --> 09:23.630
Yeah, but then the bridge
will get sucked underwater.

09:23.709 --> 09:26.420
Not if we lift
the bridge out of the water.

09:26.495 --> 09:29.513
Lift the whole bridge?
Seriously?

09:29.588 --> 09:33.943
Just watch. First, I need you to
bark out your tugboat buoy.

09:34.018 --> 09:35.692
<i>Okay.
(Barking)</i>

09:35.799 --> 09:37.726
<i>Buoy.</i>

09:37.873 --> 09:41.574

fancy flying and diving.

09:41.684 --> 09:43.934
Then you've come
to the right pup, dude.

09:44.020 --> 09:47.231
Great. Grab Rocky's buoy
and bring it over to Jake.

09:47.309 --> 09:48.949

09:58.879 --> 10:00.109
Great, Zuma.

Now drop the buoy down to Jake,
but keep hanging onto the rope.

10:05.052 --> 10:06.223
Thanks, Zuma.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.793
Now, you're going to wrap
the rope around the bridge

10:08.868 --> 10:11.829
and come up on the other side.

10:16.497 --> 10:18.667
<i>Okay, Jake,
take the rope from Zuma</i>

10:18.742 --> 10:21.266
<i>and tie it around the buoy.</i>

10:24.138 --> 10:26.832

10:26.907 --> 10:29.368
uh, whatever it is we're doing.

10:29.443 --> 10:32.681
<i>Now, we need that buoy

(Penguins squawking)

11:21.140 --> 11:22.832
(Penguins squawking)

11:23.068 --> 11:28.880
Ryder, pups, I think that was
about the coolest rescue ever.

11:29.528 --> 11:31.100
And I'm not the only one.

11:31.183 --> 11:33.479
Thanks, Jake.
And you can tell the penguins,

11:33.541 --> 11:37.693
Whenever they have a problem,
just squawk for help.

11:40.364 --> 11:43.271
Hey, that looks like fun!

11:44.533 --> 11:45.679
Blech!

11:45.721 --> 11:47.208
Yuck!

11:47.282 --> 11:48.740
