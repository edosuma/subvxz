08:53.626 --> 08:55.417
We're just growing up,
and it's just like

08:55.417 --> 08:58.083
can't ----ing fight that.

08:58.083 --> 09:02.334
It's just a matter of being real
about it, honestly.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.584
Like, there's nothing wrong.
Like, there's nothing wrong,

09:04.584 --> 09:08.334
but we both know that...
it isn't right.

09:08.334 --> 09:09.751
It isn't right right now.

09:09.751 --> 09:13.125
And I think that's been
the hardest part for me...

09:13.125 --> 09:14.709
[voice breaking]
like, making that decision

09:14.709 --> 09:18.417
to let go because, like,
the happiest moments of my life

09:18.417 --> 09:20.209
have been with James,

09:20.209 --> 09:25.167
and, like, he's just so fun
to be around, and he's funny,

09:25.167 --> 09:26.626
and he makes me smile,
and he makes me laugh.

09:26.626 --> 09:29.250
What changed?

09:29.250 --> 09:30.417
The quarantine,
it was just like after--

09:30.417 --> 09:34.083
We haven't been having sex
for a while. When it's like--

09:34.083 --> 09:36.375
Oh, you're gonna get all, like,
like, detailed like that.

09:36.375 --> 09:40.584
-When did you stop having sex?
-Well, no, it's been--

09:40.584 --> 09:42.125
it's been a while.
It's been, like, through COVID,

09:42.125 --> 09:43.501
like, we didn't really--

09:43.501 --> 09:48.250
It's been since those rage texts
that James sent me.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.334
That wasn't even this season.

09:50.334 --> 09:52.375
-That was two summers ago.

Sandoval, how would you

09:58.042 --> 09:59.125
with Jax at this point?

09:59.125 --> 10:02.083
Um...we're in different places
in our lives, and--

I then woke up to
a million texts from James.

10:32.542 --> 10:35.125
Like, "Whore, slut,"
like all this.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.083

-He did not call you a slut.

Yeah.

So even at your engagement party
at Coachella,

10:42.209 --> 10:43.959
you weren't having sex then?

10:43.959 --> 10:45.083
It was like a once a month type
thing, if you want the number.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.584
It was those--it was those--
Yeah. When it happened,

10:47.584 --> 10:49.542
we were passionately, like...
-We'd have our moments, yeah.

10:49.542 --> 10:50.959
We--We were in love

Are you living together
right now?

Yeah, we live together.
Last night was the first night

10:55.042 --> 10:56.000
she didn't sleep in the room.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.125
I was like, "I'm gonna sleep
on the couch,"

10:57.125 --> 10:59.334
and then she's like, well,
it became kind of official

10:59.334 --> 11:01.250
last night because of today.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.501
Like, well, do I wanna drag on,
put a smile on my face today

11:03.501 --> 11:06.375
for you guys, which we both
were planning on doing, okay?

11:06.375 --> 11:09.083
And then come January,
next year, it's my birthday.

11:09.083 --> 11:10.292
I'm going back to London
for a little bit.

11:10.292 --> 11:11.584
She could move out.
It was a lot easier.

11:11.584 --> 11:13.125
And then we could just do
an Instagram post,

11:13.125 --> 11:15.209
and say, guess what? We're going
both our separate ways.

11:15.209 --> 11:17.292
We love each other,
but we're not in love anymore.

11:17.292 --> 11:20.250
The season began
with the engagement

11:20.250 --> 11:22.125
and ended
with the engagement party.

11:22.125 --> 11:24.167
Was there a part of you
that felt like you needed...

11:24.167 --> 11:25.667
-Yes. Yes.
-...to keep it going because--

11:25.667 --> 11:27.459
Very embarrassing.
Yeah, vulnerable.

11:27.459 --> 11:30.000
All the emotions, yeah.
We went through a lot,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.209

-But, like...
-I'm sorry for laughing.

11:36.042 --> 11:37.292
I was just thinking
of the big engagement.

11:37.292 --> 11:40.751
I'm kinda thinking about all
the money and time you spent--

11:40.751 --> 11:43.083
Oh, come on.
It was worth it, tenfold.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.209
-Go, guys.
-$750.

11:44.209 --> 11:46.501

-Okay.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.417
-Ohh!
-We got fire dancers.

I was to say anything.

Like, you know, and Raquel--
how do we best go about this?

How do I talk to Tom,
my best mate...

[voice breaking] that ----ing
pulled all the strings for me?

12:06.417 --> 12:07.626
-Like...
-Don't worry about it, man.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.626
Don't think about that.

12:09.626 --> 12:11.626
I wanna move on and talk
to the group

12:11.626 --> 12:13.751
about Jax and Brittany.

12:13.751 --> 12:16.125
Are you all still in touch
with them?

12:16.125 --> 12:17.042
Yeah, I just saw them
on Saturday.

12:17.042 --> 12:18.167
-You did.
-We had all the babies together.

12:18.167 --> 12:20.792
Sandoval, how would you
characterize your friendship

12:20.792 --> 12:22.459
with Jax at this point?

12:22.459 --> 12:25.417
Uh, we're in different places
in our lives, and...

12:25.417 --> 12:26.626
It doesn't exist.

12:26.626 --> 12:28.250
I see him around. We say hi.

12:28.250 --> 12:29.626
Maybe we'll take a shot
together, whatever.

12:29.626 --> 12:31.501
But then he didn't come
to Katie's Christmas party

12:31.501 --> 12:33.667
because you were there.
-I have no idea what--

12:33.667 --> 12:34.792
He hates you. [laughs]

12:34.792 --> 12:36.542
-Yes. Yes.
-Yeah.

12:36.542 --> 12:38.751
Are you in touch
with Jax or Brittany at all?

12:38.751 --> 12:40.083
She's actually been supportive

12:40.083 --> 12:42.250
of the Vanderpump Dog
Foundation, and--

12:42.250 --> 12:45.000
I mean, Brittany is, like,
a sweet, sweet, sweet...

12:45.000 --> 12:46.542
-She's the sweetest girl ever.
-...wonderful person.

12:46.542 --> 12:48.125
-And their baby is adorable.
-Jax, you know,

12:48.125 --> 12:49.334
what was his last words
on the show?

12:49.334 --> 12:51.209
This is why my show
is successful.

12:51.209 --> 12:52.417
It's actually not your show.
It's actually my show.

12:52.417 --> 12:54.417
-I know. But this is why--
-Okay, and I put your ass on it,

12:54.417 --> 12:56.792
so don't be ----ing
disrespectful to me.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.125
-Famous last words.
-Famous last words.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.459
-Yeah, exactly.
-Oh, man.

13:00.459 --> 13:01.542
Famous last words.

13:01.542 --> 13:04.292
All right, so moving on, James,
I wanna talk about

13:04.292 --> 13:05.417
your sobriety a little bit.

13:05.417 --> 13:08.125
How do you define
"California sober"?

13:08.125 --> 13:11.375
So I, you know,
don't drink anymore,

13:11.375 --> 13:13.626
and, uh, I just smoke weed.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.459
So, Raquel,
can you take psychedelics

13:15.459 --> 13:17.417
and be California sober?

13:17.417 --> 13:19.375
-Well, I think...
-Yeah.

13:19.375 --> 13:20.584
-Raquel.
-You can.

13:20.584 --> 13:22.125
Mushrooms are a part
of California sober.

13:22.125 --> 13:23.209
The question was to Raquel,
guys.

13:23.209 --> 13:25.209
-Yeah.
-But you can't do cocaine.

13:25.209 --> 13:28.125
-Were you doing coke?
-No, I wasn't, and, like, look,

13:28.125 --> 13:30.292
like, wait, back
when I was drinking?

13:30.292 --> 13:31.334
-Sorry we said that.
-Back when I was drinking?

13:31.334 --> 13:32.501
-Yeah.
-On the off chance

13:32.501 --> 13:35.751
in Hollywood, sometimes,
you know, yeah.

13:35.751 --> 13:37.292
I did when I would drink
sometimes.

13:37.292 --> 13:38.959
You said it one
of your interviews,

13:38.959 --> 13:41.459
you said, "I'm high right now."
Are you high right now?

13:41.459 --> 13:43.000
-Yes.
-You are?

13:43.000 --> 13:43.959
You're high right now?

13:43.959 --> 13:45.209
You got high before the reunion?

13:45.209 --> 13:47.083
-Well, you asked.
-What?

13:47.083 --> 13:48.000
-Wow.
-So how do we know--

13:48.000 --> 13:50.167
Boom. I'm high.
Boom. There it is. Whoo!

13:50.167 --> 13:52.125
That's probably why you're not
having sex,

13:52.125 --> 13:54.834
if you're always stoned
out of your mind, right?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.334
Am I right or not?

13:56.334 --> 13:57.501
No, I feel like weed
makes it better.

13:57.501 --> 13:59.125
Sex when you're high
is pretty fun.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.209
Thanks, Andy. I need backup now.

14:00.209 --> 14:02.209
Sorry. Well, James,
you've struggled to contain

14:02.209 --> 14:03.792
your anger all season.

14:03.792 --> 14:05.209
-He's being weak, Lisa.
-No, no, he's not being weak.

14:05.209 --> 14:06.334
-I'm being weak?
-I can feel his wussy energy

14:06.334 --> 14:08.209
spewing off of him.
-He's drawing a line in the--

14:08.209 --> 14:10.083
Sorry you guys are so dumb,
you can't figure it out.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.584
Take your ----ing words
out of your mouth

14:11.584 --> 14:13.250
and shove 'em
up your ----ing ass.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.334
You're rude, you're obnoxious,
and you don't give a [bleep]

14:14.334 --> 14:16.334
about anyone but yourself.
I'm embarrassed for you.

14:16.334 --> 14:18.292
Raquel, did his rage issues

14:18.292 --> 14:20.626
inform your growing apart
from him?

14:20.626 --> 14:22.334
Yeah, of course.

14:22.334 --> 14:25.209
Do you think you need to work
on yourself, too?

14:25.209 --> 14:28.083
-Yeah.
-Raquel's been--

14:28.083 --> 14:30.584
Look, she's been saying
that she wants to do stuff.

14:30.584 --> 14:32.584
-Let her speak.
-Sure. Go ahead, babe.

14:32.584 --> 14:34.083
Well, yeah, he knows.
I've been saying that

14:34.083 --> 14:37.417
I wanna be a pediatric
occupational therapist

14:37.417 --> 14:40.375
ever since I graduated
from college.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.501
I've just kind of been
putting it off

14:42.501 --> 14:45.125
trying to model and, like,
living the L.A. life.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.709
But I think I need to, like,
switch gears.

14:46.709 --> 14:51.667
I'm not able to commit
to something like that

14:51.667 --> 14:53.542
when I'm feeling drained.

14:53.542 --> 14:56.417
You're still wearing
your engagement ring, huh?

14:56.417 --> 14:58.167
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

14:58.167 --> 15:01.292
I'm--I'm gonna give it back
to him. Do you want it now?

15:01.292 --> 15:06.334
Sure. I mean, I...

15:06.334 --> 15:07.292
[laughs] "Don't give it back."

15:07.292 --> 15:11.209
Well, no, I'm not gonna keep it.
[chuckles]

15:11.209 --> 15:12.501
-All right. Here.
-Thank you. That's a Bitcoin.

15:12.501 --> 15:16.375
Oh.

15:16.375 --> 15:17.709
-[laughter]
-What?

15:17.709 --> 15:19.751
I'm just saying I can't believe
I'm just watching that happen.

15:19.751 --> 15:21.584
-I'm shocked.
-What is happening?

15:21.584 --> 15:23.417
I definitely don't think you
should've gave the ring back.

15:23.417 --> 15:25.250
-My opinion.
-Is this real?

15:25.250 --> 15:29.292
It's hard. It's, like... [sighs]

15:29.292 --> 15:33.417
I envisioned a life with James,
and it was...

15:33.417 --> 15:36.626
something that I fantasized
about a lot.

15:36.626 --> 15:39.459
Um, so it's kind of, like,
closing that book

15:39.459 --> 15:43.125
and just redirecting my energy
somewhere else.

15:43.125 --> 15:44.751
How long has this
been going for?

15:44.751 --> 15:46.125
Brock, we've already
answered that.

15:46.125 --> 15:47.250
-We've just been talking.
-Yes.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.626
Have you--
Have you been listening?

15:48.626 --> 15:50.417
I've been listening.
I just can't get my head

15:50.417 --> 15:52.334
wrapped around that.
-I'm sure it was tough

15:52.334 --> 15:53.501
when you left your family
in Australia...

15:53.501 --> 15:55.417
-100%, bro.
-...to come pursue a big,

15:55.417 --> 15:57.042
big, bold life in L.A., right?
I'm sure that was tough as well.

15:57.042 --> 15:58.375
Is that what you think it was,
James?

15:58.375 --> 15:59.751
You think that's what it is,
bro?

15:59.751 --> 16:01.292
I'm sure that was tough, though,
right?

16:01.292 --> 16:02.459
All right, we can get in--
we can have this, guys.

16:02.459 --> 16:03.626
We all have our tough moments,
mate, and, yes, that was

16:03.626 --> 16:04.667
a very tough time for me.

16:04.667 --> 16:05.792
Learn from your ----ing moments.

16:05.792 --> 16:07.375
Don't need to hear from
your big, ogre voice louder.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.667
Learn. Learn.
----ing learn and get help.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.042
Everyone said that to you
the whole time.

16:11.042 --> 16:12.667
You need to do that, too,
brother.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.167
-I do get help, bro.
-Cool. Thank you.

16:14.167 --> 16:15.792
Because that's how I try
and ----ing get better.

16:15.792 --> 16:18.334
You know, this is the--this is
the--these are the reasons why

16:18.334 --> 16:21.542
I wanted to do that later
and all that stuff. Like...

16:21.542 --> 16:22.751
-Well, it's too late.
-Well, it happened, so...

16:22.751 --> 16:24.542
-I don't want to be that--
-The genie's out of the bottle.

16:24.542 --> 16:26.459

-Who?

21:19.501 --> 21:21.083

don't be friends with her.

-Danica.

I was like, I can't drink

'cause I have to, like, blow
into my Breathalyzer in my car.

21:27.459 --> 21:29.417

because I was dead-ass sober

21:29.417 --> 21:32.250
'cause I was pregnant,
and I said, "Raquel, I'm not

21:32.250 --> 21:35.417

and can't be friends with,

21:35.417 --> 21:36.834

21:36.834 --> 21:38.667
it's very, like--
-...if you can--Hold on.

-I'm talking.
-No, but you would say it.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.125
-Hold on. I'm talking.
-It's just very, like,

21:41.125 --> 21:42.209
but this is an ultimatum.
-This is what I said.

21:42.209 --> 21:44.542
Because I remember
'cause I was sober. I remember.

21:44.542 --> 21:46.626
I said, specifically,
if you continue

21:46.626 --> 21:48.751
to hang out with her,
this makes me uncomfortable.

21:48.751 --> 21:50.751
-Yes.
-So excuse me

21:50.751 --> 21:53.667
during that time when I was
pregnant after a miscarriage,

21:53.667 --> 21:55.834
but I didn't want this person
around me in my inner circle,

21:55.834 --> 21:58.250

you
in my circle.

-So that morning, I wake up.

I responded.

23:33.792 --> 23:35.751

23:35.751 --> 23:38.501
It wasn't bitchy. It was
a little bit, like, intense

23:38.501 --> 23:39.542

-Did you sit up all night mad?

23:39.542 --> 23:41.334

-Scheana, I'm not you.

for attention.

Why? How come?

25:39.250 --> 25:41.250

25:41.250 --> 25:44.542
that we aren't each
other's soul mates,

about the challenges
to your body during pregnancy.

26:41.292 --> 26:45.334
-What have been your struggles?
-I mean, I gained 55 pounds,

26:45.334 --> 26:50.083
and although I knew my body
created a human life,

26:50.083 --> 26:54.542
after I had her,
it was definitely a struggle.

26:54.542 --> 26:57.417
Yeah. Lala, I'm sure some moms
across the country

26:57.417 --> 26:59.250
were kicking
their television sets

26:59.250 --> 27:02.709
when you showed off
your post-baby body.

27:02.709 --> 27:06.918

or a pact with Satan?

27:07.918 --> 27:09.250
-Pact with Satan.
-It was Satan.

-All three.
-You know, I have to just

27:11.584 --> 27:15.125

but even though I felt like

things were sitting differently.

heard Scheana imply

27:27.876 --> 27:31.167

raise your child?

27:31.167 --> 27:33.209
Unfortunately, you know,

27:33.209 --> 27:38.834
I didn't have a partner
in it with me.

27:38.834 --> 27:41.209

like, a week ago.

27:41.209 --> 27:42.667

I didn't have what Scheana has
with Brock.

27:45.751 --> 27:50.417
My option was a night nurse
to help me out,

27:50.417 --> 27:53.667
and a day nurse, and I'm forever
grateful for those women.

27:53.667 --> 27:55.542

in this.

Speaking of babies, Schwartz,
when you and Katie were trying

27:57.834 --> 28:00.667

you were really working at it

28:00.667 --> 28:04.334

for three months.

28:04.334 --> 28:07.125
Is 15 times in 90 days
your definition

28:07.125 --> 28:10.209
of really working at it?

28:10.209 --> 28:13.584
-15's impressive.
-That's a lot of sex.

28:13.584 --> 28:14.918
-That's a lot of sex.
-It was a world record,

what you're asking me.

no plans to have a baby...

-'Cause he says it all the time.

"No, I don't want one," so...

29:39.834 --> 29:41.626
having a kid, like,
I'm into that,

29:41.626 --> 29:43.751

butted heads before

29:43.751 --> 29:47.584
is when Ariana said "Never,"
and I don't wanna be told never.

29:47.584 --> 29:50.209
Did you ever consider
freezing embryos?

29:50.209 --> 29:51.501
I told him to go do it,

29:51.501 --> 29:52.918
and he has not taken
any initiative to do it.

29:52.918 --> 29:54.751
Oh, you--wait.
I don't remember that.

29:54.751 --> 29:58.292

you should go freeze embryos.

-Oh, I'll go do that.
-Okay, well,

30:00.209 --> 30:01.709

-Scheana, you said if you were

30:01.709 --> 30:04.209
gonna have another child,
you would likely use

30:04.209 --> 30:06.834
one of your frozen eggs
and a surrogate. Why?

30:06.834 --> 30:09.250
I got diagnosed
with pre-eclampsia,

30:09.250 --> 30:11.167

after giving birth,

30:11.167 --> 30:14.834
that advanced to HELLP syndrome,
which is extremely rare

30:14.834 --> 30:16.709

my body.

33:11.209 --> 33:12.459
-Ew.
-It sucks when he's like,

33:12.459 --> 33:14.250
it's like, 3 a.m. and he's like,
"I really wanna crack one off."

33:14.250 --> 33:17.250
Schwartz, I never wanna hear you
say that word ever again

33:17.250 --> 33:18.834
in my life.
-Great responsibility, Sandoval.

33:18.834 --> 33:21.125
-I'm scarred.
-Oh.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.292
-[laughter]
-Let's move on.

33:23.292 --> 33:25.834
Schwartz, I gotta admit
I was a little lost

33:25.834 --> 33:27.459
hearing the mission statement
of your bar.

33:27.459 --> 33:29.876
-Dive lounge. Yes.
-It's a dive lounge.

33:29.876 --> 33:31.292
Yes!

33:31.292 --> 33:33.250
Can we communicate that
to other people?

33:33.250 --> 33:35.375
Do we need to do--Maybe we don't
need to do that.

33:35.375 --> 33:36.542
No.

33:36.542 --> 33:37.709
-What was I saying?
-Exactly.

33:37.709 --> 33:40.167
[laughter]

33:40.167 --> 33:43.167
Can you tell me in 10 seconds
or less

33:43.167 --> 33:44.709
what the bar's gonna be?

33:44.709 --> 33:50.334
Yeah, so it's a funky, vibrant,
cozy dive lounge,

33:50.334 --> 33:52.292
uh, nestled under
the Hollywood Hills

33:52.292 --> 33:54.626
in one of my favorite parts
of Hollywood--Franklin Village.

33:54.626 --> 33:56.834
-[beeping, buzzer]
-Shout out to Franklin Village.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.250
-Oh, my God.
-Up there.

33:58.250 --> 34:00.417
[beeping]
Um, we're gonna have

34:00.417 --> 34:02.459
some playful, fresh cocktails.

34:02.459 --> 34:03.542
-That's 10 seconds.
-That's more than 10 seconds.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.667
-Okay.
-[laughter]

34:04.667 --> 34:08.792
-I was just warming up.
-Okay, well, we got it, kind of.

34:08.792 --> 34:11.667
Lisa, how did you first hear

34:11.667 --> 34:13.751
that the Toms were opening
a new place?

34:13.751 --> 34:17.334
Well, actually,
interesting you asked me.

34:17.334 --> 34:19.584
-It was Jax Taylor.
-Oh, really?

34:19.584 --> 34:20.792
Yes. Shortly after...

34:20.792 --> 34:22.000
-He snitched.
-...he'd been let go,

34:22.000 --> 34:25.709
he said to me, "By the way,
just giving you the heads up,

34:25.709 --> 34:28.459
they're opening a bar together."
-No.

34:28.459 --> 34:30.292
-He called you up?
-Yeah, right, yeah, wow.

34:30.292 --> 34:32.626
-Little going-away present.
-Yeah.

34:32.626 --> 34:34.626
I think he expected me
probably to, you know,

34:34.626 --> 34:36.417
have a conniption
or be apoplectic.

34:36.417 --> 34:38.125
-I'm sure wanted you to.
-What was your reaction?

34:38.125 --> 34:40.250
Well, look, I expect them
to go on.

34:40.250 --> 34:43.125
I want them
all
to do well.
That's the point.

34:43.125 --> 34:46.667
Schwartz, Lisa offered you
your TomTom money back

34:46.667 --> 34:49.459
plus $100,000 each.

34:49.459 --> 34:55.542
You said no, but then we saw you
getting denied for loans.

34:55.542 --> 34:57.709
Why not accept Lisa's offer?

34:57.709 --> 34:59.626
Um... [sighs]

34:59.626 --> 35:03.501
Man, that would be like parting
ways with your firstborn.

35:03.501 --> 35:05.501
So, Schwartz, where did you
finally get the money

35:05.501 --> 35:07.834
for the loan?
-Yeah, I did a cash-out refi

35:07.834 --> 35:11.792
and, um, I feel great
about that. Oh, my God.

35:11.792 --> 35:13.459
----ing refi what?

35:13.459 --> 35:14.626
When are you planning
on opening?

35:14.626 --> 35:18.834
Well, we're looking at probably
I would say Spring 2022.

35:18.834 --> 35:21.334
Are you on budget?

35:21.334 --> 35:23.918
-We currently are below budget.
-Below budget.

35:23.918 --> 35:25.417
-Yeah.
-Okay.

35:25.417 --> 35:26.918
-That's true.
-This is true.

35:26.918 --> 35:29.709
Okay. Well, the great news is
that the two of you

35:29.709 --> 35:32.542
shot a video tour,
and let's see the progress.

-This wasn't here before.

35:46.417 --> 35:48.334

So you'll walk in here.

35:48.334 --> 35:50.125
You'll have the hostess stand

We're working on busts
of ourselves.

We're gonna be in, like,
a neon color, pink and green.

-Yeah.
-It's a whole thing.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.250

36:00.250 --> 36:02.918
This will be our hero booth,

36:02.918 --> 36:04.918
from the ceiling,
and then inside of it,

36:04.918 --> 36:09.167
tucked inside of it
is a fiber optic starry night.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.375
It's the only place in L.A.

36:10.375 --> 36:11.626
where you're guaranteed
to see the stars.

36:11.626 --> 36:12.918
Yeah.

36:12.918 --> 36:15.959
So we have our lovely tile here
that's going on the back bar.

36:15.959 --> 36:18.834
We actually--Schwartz and I
actually demoed all this tile.

36:18.834 --> 36:20.375
-We demoed the tile...
-We did.

36:20.375 --> 36:24.584
...underneath the bar.

36:24.584 --> 36:26.375
-Um...
-I got a blister.

36:26.375 --> 36:27.834
-[chuckles]
-There's pictures to prove it.

36:27.834 --> 36:29.751
My first Schwartz & Sandy's
blister.

36:29.751 --> 36:31.334
All right.

36:31.334 --> 36:33.918
We are working on this project
every single day.

36:33.918 --> 36:36.459
-We love it.
-Yeah. We love it.

36:36.459 --> 36:38.334
It's intense, though,
and I kinda need a hug,

36:38.334 --> 36:39.876
but we love it.
-Hey, come here, dude.

36:39.876 --> 36:39.876
-Yeah.

36:39.876 --> 36:45.709
We are back with the gang
from "Vanderpump Rules."

36:45.709 --> 36:50.459
Welcome back to
the "Vanderpump Rules" Reunion.

36:50.459 --> 36:52.876
Katie, I wanna talk
about you and Sandoval.

36:52.876 --> 36:55.417
At the start of the season,
you expressed interest

36:55.417 --> 36:58.375
in working on the new bar,
but I have to say,

36:58.375 --> 36:59.959
from the start,
you seemed a little critical

36:59.959 --> 37:03.042
of Sandoval's ideas.

37:03.042 --> 37:06.334
Have you ever heard
of a Schwartz & Sandy's?

37:06.334 --> 37:10.667
No, and I'm glad I haven't.
It's uninspired.

37:10.667 --> 37:11.792
Like, criticism wasn't

37:11.792 --> 37:14.292
necessarily coming directly
from me.

37:14.292 --> 37:18.250
It was kind of coming
from...Tom.

37:18.250 --> 37:20.292
You know, he was sorting
airing grievances to me

37:20.292 --> 37:22.334
that he didn't like some of
the things that were happening,

37:22.334 --> 37:23.250
some of the conversations
they were having.

37:23.250 --> 37:25.209
-Just one thing.
-Particularly the name.

37:25.209 --> 37:27.918
Just one thing. And also,
I did express that to Sandoval,

37:27.918 --> 37:30.375
just for the record, clearly.

37:30.375 --> 37:31.876
And he didn't sure listen
to you.

37:31.876 --> 37:33.751
-You did?
-He--He told me he wasn't

37:33.751 --> 37:35.709
crazy about the name, but then
he--but the reason why--

37:35.709 --> 37:38.876
He would literally walk away
from the bar.

37:38.876 --> 37:40.709
He's like, "I will--" He's like,
"I will ----ing walk away."

37:40.709 --> 37:42.375
Schwartz does that
all the time.

37:42.375 --> 37:44.292
So what about the idea
of Katie being involved

37:44.292 --> 37:46.292
in the bar upsets you so much?

37:46.292 --> 37:50.167
When me and Schwartz first
started this journey together,

37:50.167 --> 37:52.501
there was one thing I was just
very adamant about

37:52.501 --> 37:55.667
when we started this,
and it was I don't wanna have

37:55.667 --> 37:58.501
significant others
involved in this big risk

37:58.501 --> 38:00.000
and business venture.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.292
This was already so stressful
enough,

38:02.292 --> 38:04.751
and we made that deal
two years ago.

38:04.751 --> 38:07.334
Moving forward,
it was fully understandable.

38:07.334 --> 38:09.375
-I was very clear about that.
-Hold on. Hold on a sec. Okay.

38:09.375 --> 38:12.334
Sandoval's right.
We did have this discussion.

38:12.334 --> 38:14.501
We're adults, and we're allowed
to change our minds

38:14.501 --> 38:15.792
based on new information.

38:15.792 --> 38:18.792
I didn't anticipate
Katie being so passionate

38:18.792 --> 38:20.918
about wanting to be a part
of it.

38:20.918 --> 38:22.209
Well, I mean, but what about

38:22.209 --> 38:23.250
my passion
in the year and a half

38:23.250 --> 38:26.459
of stressing out and, like,
going through COVID

38:26.459 --> 38:28.876
and trying to raise money
and literally spending hours

38:28.876 --> 38:30.375
on the phone with, like,
investors?

38:30.375 --> 38:33.334
All this sh-- that we've
been working on.

38:33.334 --> 38:35.209
I was more than willing
to get you involved

38:35.209 --> 38:37.918
in some way, shape, or form,
but, like, right off the bat,

38:37.918 --> 38:38.959
started hassling me
and heckling me,

38:38.959 --> 38:40.125
and I'm sitting here
and I'm being like, dude...

38:40.125 --> 38:41.209
He asked me for my input
in the name because he didn't

38:41.209 --> 38:43.876
like your ideas, and you
wouldn't listen to him.

38:43.876 --> 38:45.417
-Okay, okay.
-I don't care, Katie.

38:45.417 --> 38:47.334
You were wanting to put
your stamp on this.

38:47.334 --> 38:50.584
-Like, don't get it twisted.
-You told Katie

38:50.584 --> 38:53.709
that you've been bringing money
into their household.

38:53.709 --> 38:56.250
How much money have I brought
into your ----ing household?

38:56.250 --> 38:59.834
I worked my ----ing ass off
to create business opportunities

38:59.834 --> 39:02.542
for Amazon,
for club appearances.

39:02.542 --> 39:03.876
He makes his own money.

39:03.876 --> 39:06.375
Do not take credit
for what the [bleep] he does.

39:06.375 --> 39:08.667
The whole reason why I was
bringing that up

39:08.667 --> 39:10.584
is that these choices
and these things that I do

39:10.584 --> 39:11.751
and sometimes when I seem like

39:11.751 --> 39:13.667
I'm pushing Schwartz
or whatever,

39:13.667 --> 39:16.292
it's because I'm trying
to push us to the next--

39:16.292 --> 39:17.167
to that next level.

39:17.167 --> 39:20.209
Well, I will say, um,
he is a champion,

39:20.209 --> 39:22.459
an advocate for Tom Schwartz,
but, like, you know,

39:22.459 --> 39:25.918
watching back that conversation
he had with Katie,

39:25.918 --> 39:28.334
where he was just sort of
boasting about bringing money

39:28.334 --> 39:29.918
into the house, like,
that was the most...

39:29.918 --> 39:31.292
-Gross.
-...cocksure I've ever seen him

39:31.292 --> 39:32.417
in my life.

39:32.417 --> 39:34.334
-You weren't boasting at all.
-I was not boasting.

39:34.334 --> 39:35.626
I did not see you boasting
about that.

39:35.626 --> 39:37.876
-Anyways...
-I was not boasting, dude.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.918
It felt patronizing
and condescending

39:39.918 --> 39:41.000
'cause we do this for--

39:41.000 --> 39:41.918
I've been attacked
for months, dude.

39:41.918 --> 39:44.209
I've been trying to work
on our business

39:44.209 --> 39:46.375
and literally
have been attacked.

39:46.375 --> 39:48.501
I've had propaganda
spread about me

39:48.501 --> 39:49.417
for, like, months.

39:49.417 --> 39:51.834
-Like, I've had a target on me.
-[laughs]

39:51.834 --> 39:53.000
Yeah, what the [bleep] are you
talking about?

39:53.000 --> 39:54.459
The way that the conversation
was described afterwards,

39:54.459 --> 39:55.584
I was like,
that's not what I watched.

39:55.584 --> 39:57.501
The way it was described
afterwards was, like, she went--

39:57.501 --> 39:58.876
you ran to Lisa and said that,

39:58.876 --> 40:01.459
like, I created
the TomTom brand,

40:01.459 --> 40:03.292
that I tried to drive a wedge
between me and Lisa?

40:03.292 --> 40:05.125
You tried to take credit
for the TomTom brand.

40:05.125 --> 40:07.292
You can't take credit
for an entire human being

40:07.292 --> 40:08.542
who also brings--

40:08.542 --> 40:09.709
I didn't take credit
for Schwartz.

40:09.709 --> 40:11.250
-We saw the conversation.
-Where? How was all that stuff

40:11.250 --> 40:12.584
getting conflated
from watching that scene?

40:12.584 --> 40:13.751
She feels that
he's generating--

40:13.751 --> 40:15.918
-Hey, come on.
-He drives the motorcycle.

40:15.918 --> 40:17.751
-He's in the sidecar, you know?
-Right, but I--

40:17.751 --> 40:18.542
There says a lot, too.

40:18.542 --> 40:19.792
That's how it is in life
for them.

40:19.792 --> 40:20.959
-That says a lot.
-But I still think

40:20.959 --> 40:24.292
it's very emasculating for
Schwartz to hear Sandoval say

40:24.292 --> 40:26.834
"I put money into your family."
That's not okay as a friend.

40:26.834 --> 40:28.250
-I'm just saying.
-Fine. Fine. I get that,

40:28.250 --> 40:30.417
but, like--
-Sandoval, right now he's doing

40:30.417 --> 40:32.334
all the work. Right now he's
going to the stone yards...

40:32.334 --> 40:33.334

Stop, stop, stop.

40:35.626 --> 40:37.250
...I'm like, where's Sandoval?
"I don't know."

40:37.250 --> 40:38.542
-Shh. Shh.
-"He doesn't return my emails."

40:38.542 --> 40:40.292
"He doesn't return
a phone call.

40:40.292 --> 40:41.334

40:56.334 --> 40:59.250
of the "Vanderpump Rules"
Reunion.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.626
What rumors had you heard
about Randall?

41:01.626 --> 41:03.959
Hotel room stuff, girls,
meeting up.

41:03.959 --> 41:06.626
I didn't put two and two
together, but keep in mind--

41:06.626 --> 41:08.834
'Cause you didn't need to put
two and two together, Lala.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.375
You got a Range Rover out of it.

41:11.375 --> 41:13.751
Who gives a flying [bleep]
what I wanna do with my life?

41:13.751 --> 41:15.334
It doesn't mean that what
my friends go through

41:15.334 --> 41:16.626
isn't important to me.

41:16.626 --> 41:18.501
Engagements and weddings?

41:18.501 --> 41:20.417
This is clearly something
that's not something that's

41:20.417 --> 41:22.667
important to you, so you're
not gonna understand it.

41:22.667 --> 41:25.459
God, the both of you need
to, like, shut up.

41:25.459 --> 41:27.292
Do you know
how frustrating it is?

41:27.292 --> 41:29.876
Why can't I have
a ----ing happy moment?

41:29.876 --> 41:31.417
Because someone else
got engaged?

41:31.417 --> 41:33.876
It was their engagement party.

41:33.876 --> 41:34.751
I would never do that
to a friend.

41:34.751 --> 41:37.751
I'm not that tacky or cheap.

41:37.751 --> 41:41.584
When did you first notice
signs of trouble?

41:41.584 --> 41:43.459
[voice breaking]
There's two pictures

41:43.459 --> 41:45.709
that have come out
with Randall and two girls.

41:45.709 --> 41:48.584
I feel disgusted.

41:48.584 --> 41:51.667
This man--he knew what he was
out doing,

41:51.667 --> 41:54.334
and he made me feel safe enough

41:54.334 --> 41:58.334
to bring a child
into this world. [sniffles]
