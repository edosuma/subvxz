Finn! Finn!

00:36.803 --> 00:38.066
Finn, where are you?

00:38.138 --> 00:39.606
I need you to try this.

00:39.672 --> 00:42.073
I'll be there in a sec.

00:43.943 --> 00:45.878
What's the status? - Good, man.

00:45.945 --> 00:48.574
Nice. Seal the deal, bro.

00:50.283 --> 00:51.376
Okay, man. Whatevs.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.044
You can do it! You hear me?

00:53.119 --> 00:55.054
I'm playin' Beemo. Call me later.
Bye.

00:55.121 --> 00:56.714
How's Finn's date?

00:56.790 --> 00:58.383
I think it's goin' good.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.051
Unlike your game, boy-eeee.

01:00.126 --> 01:02.391
Where's the key to
the tower, Beemo?!

01:02.462 --> 01:04.363
Tell me! Aaaah!

01:04.431 --> 01:07.595
Okay, Finn. She's 13. <i>You're</i> 13.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.693
Just have fun. Be yourself.

01:09.769 --> 01:13.501
Whoooooooooooooop!

01:13.573 --> 01:14.666
What's that?

01:14.741 --> 01:16.733
Are you trying to make
yourself 18 again?

01:16.810 --> 01:18.904
Nah. This is an
instant bath serum.

01:18.978 --> 01:20.913
It makes you sweat
cleaning agents.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.814
I don't bathe. I want that.

01:24.884 --> 01:27.149
Hot!

01:27.220 --> 01:29.155
So spice! So spice!

01:29.222 --> 01:30.656
You're so spice!

01:30.723 --> 01:33.989
♪ Bwaa bwaa bwaa bwaa ♪

01:34.060 --> 01:39.021
Announcing the arrival of
the Earl of Lemongrab!

01:40.100 --> 01:42.262
Aah!

01:42.335 --> 01:43.335
Oooh!

01:45.438 --> 01:48.340
This castle is in...

01:48.408 --> 01:50.775
unacceptable...

01:50.844 --> 01:52.540
condition!

01:52.612 --> 01:54.774
Unacceptable!

01:56.583 --> 01:58.313
30 days in the dungeon!

01:58.384 --> 02:01.752
- For who?
- Everyone in this room.

02:01.821 --> 02:03.312
Aah!

02:03.389 --> 02:05.085
Wait! Wait!

02:05.158 --> 02:06.751
You can't give orders like that!

02:06.826 --> 02:08.419
I'm in charge here, Lemongrab!

02:08.495 --> 02:09.554
Too young!

02:09.628 --> 02:11.222
Too young to rule the kingdom!

02:11.297 --> 02:13.289
Watch your manners
with the princess!

02:13.366 --> 02:14.925
Hooooooooo!

02:15.001 --> 02:17.368
- What the huh?
- Mm...

02:17.437 --> 02:21.306
I am next in line to the throne,

02:21.374 --> 02:23.866
so I will be in charge

02:23.943 --> 02:27.311
until Princess Bubblegum
turns 18 again!

02:27.380 --> 02:29.315
That's bunk! Right, Preebos?

02:29.382 --> 02:30.611
No.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.618
He is rightful ruler
under kingdom law.

02:32.685 --> 02:35.120
It's complicated.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.656
I created Lemongrab.

02:37.724 --> 02:41.183
He was the first one of my
experiments gone wrong.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.492
Nyaaaaaaaaaaah!

02:51.738 --> 02:53.900
And now that I'm
younger than him,

02:53.973 --> 02:56.636
he inherits the right
to control the throne.

02:56.709 --> 02:59.406
If anyone needs me,
I'll be taking a nap.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.414
And clean this place
up, or dungeon!

03:01.481 --> 03:03.040
Three hours dungeon!

03:03.116 --> 03:04.880
Who are you talkin' to?

03:04.951 --> 03:07.944
Three hours dungeon!

03:08.021 --> 03:11.549
Nooooo!

03:11.624 --> 03:13.559
We'll see you in a few hours.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.561
Okay, Starchy? - Yeah, right.

03:15.628 --> 03:17.722
If Starchy survives that long.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.732
Finn, this is dirt balls!

03:19.799 --> 03:21.859
We've got to do something
to make him leave!

03:21.935 --> 03:23.062
Yeah!

03:23.136 --> 03:24.661
Like pranking him up his face!

03:24.737 --> 03:27.002
Yeah! And I have
the perfect prank!

03:27.073 --> 03:28.234
Come on, Finn.

04:08.314 --> 04:09.748
Huh?

04:09.816 --> 04:11.648
"You... really...

04:11.718 --> 04:13.482
smell... like...

04:13.553 --> 04:15.146
dog buns"?

04:19.625 --> 04:21.390
Well, well, well.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.157
This is everyone, then?

04:23.229 --> 04:25.164
Yes. All the castle staff.

04:25.231 --> 04:28.395
So which one of you was it?

04:28.468 --> 04:30.960
Who did the thing?!

04:31.037 --> 04:33.632
The thing?

04:38.678 --> 04:40.579
The thing! The thing!

04:40.647 --> 04:43.048
Hey, man! Calm down.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.608
It's just a prank, man.
For laughs.

04:45.685 --> 04:48.484
Prank? For laughs?

04:49.489 --> 04:51.583
Yes, of course.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.752
Just a harmless prank...

04:53.826 --> 04:55.260
for laughs.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.971
12 years dungeon, all of you...
dungeon.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.939
Seven years, no trials.

05:07.006 --> 05:08.099
Come on. Let's move it.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.910
I don't think that worked
out too math, Finn.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.173
What? No, no.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.943
He just needs some more
prankings to finish the job.

05:16.015 --> 05:17.313
He'll leave the kingdom.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.375
Let's try it <i>my</i> way
this time, okay?

05:19.452 --> 05:21.444
Okay.

05:30.463 --> 05:33.160
Ooh!

05:39.605 --> 05:41.870
Ha ha ha ha ha! Good one!

05:43.943 --> 05:45.206
Keep 'em coming!

05:45.278 --> 05:47.213
I'm not going anywhere!

05:47.280 --> 05:50.273
Ho ha!

05:51.451 --> 05:52.749
I got a new plan!

05:52.819 --> 05:54.981
Oh, yeah? What?

05:58.124 --> 06:00.719
We'll work together and
use that serum you made,

06:00.793 --> 06:02.728
the one that was "Ah! So spice!"

06:02.795 --> 06:05.731
and spice-bomb him nonstop
'til his butt falls out.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.426
How's that sound?

06:10.470 --> 06:12.701
Thank you for releasing me
from the dungeon early,

06:12.772 --> 06:14.365
Master Lemongrab.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.705
I determine what is
early and what is late,

06:16.776 --> 06:18.608
Mr. Peppermint.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.271
Yes, your Earlness.

06:20.346 --> 06:23.339
Also, I don't know
where food comes from.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.009
My lord, food comes from ma...

06:25.084 --> 06:27.076
No! Da-da-da-da-da! No!

06:27.153 --> 06:31.955
That is why I am royal
and <i>you</i> are servile!

06:33.760 --> 06:35.058
You ready to pour the stuff?

06:35.128 --> 06:37.154
Yeah. I made it super
hot this time.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.755
Wait 'til he opens the lid.

06:38.831 --> 06:41.858
Behold, a plate of mashed
carrots, flavor...

06:43.603 --> 06:45.538
Shoot!

06:45.605 --> 06:47.870
Shh.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.671
Stop screaming! Why
are you screaming?!

06:50.743 --> 06:53.440
Because I'm excited
by this meal I made!

06:55.648 --> 06:58.948
Me, too. I'm excited, too.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.869
Whoa!

07:15.935 --> 07:19.633
He's eating the dirt.
Spice it now!

07:28.881 --> 07:31.874
Apple!

07:35.788 --> 07:37.552
Oh!

07:37.623 --> 07:39.057
Ooh!

07:39.125 --> 07:40.718
Mmm!

07:40.793 --> 07:42.557
Oop.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.593
Mmm!

07:48.000 --> 07:51.437
One million years dungeon!

07:52.972 --> 07:54.440
Hmm.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.601
Maybe if we set
his butt on fire?

07:56.676 --> 07:59.510
No, Finn. There's only one way.

07:59.579 --> 08:02.413
I just didn't want
to have to do it.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.417
If I change myself
back to my <i>real</i> age,

08:04.484 --> 08:06.112
I can reclaim the throne.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.778
What?! No!

08:07.854 --> 08:11.291
I mean, uh, you can do that?

08:12.658 --> 08:14.650
Then why did you wait so long?

08:14.727 --> 08:17.663
Because being 13 again is

08:17.730 --> 08:19.028
bloobalooby!

08:19.098 --> 08:20.031
Hmm?

08:20.099 --> 08:23.831
Well, being 18 is all
plopdumps and waggle-sags.

08:23.903 --> 08:26.998
I never really get
to act like a kid.

08:27.073 --> 08:29.008
But it's okay, really.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.101
My people need me, and
that comes first.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.975
Yeah.

08:33.044 --> 08:35.275
The first thing we need
is more candyflesh

08:35.347 --> 08:36.941
to increase my biomass.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.417
But I need my lab
equipment to engineer it.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.477
Not necessarily, m'lady.

08:47.793 --> 08:51.252
Oh, thank you! Thank you all!

08:51.330 --> 08:53.595
Okay, next we need
a bonding agent.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.329
Princess, I think I can help.

09:05.511 --> 09:08.140
Finished!

09:08.214 --> 09:09.842
There's one last thing we need.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.782
Only the heat from a
whopping love-hug

09:11.851 --> 09:14.980
can catalyze the
re-agifying process.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.217
Are you ready, Princess?

09:20.293 --> 09:22.990
Yes, Finn, but first,
I just want to say

09:23.062 --> 09:25.361
how much fun I've had
hanging out with you.

09:25.431 --> 09:26.431
Me too!

09:26.465 --> 09:27.831
And I...

09:27.900 --> 09:29.528
I wish I could stay

09:29.602 --> 09:31.571
like this with you, but...

09:31.637 --> 09:33.503
I... I know, Princess.

09:39.612 --> 09:42.673
'Scuse me, Finn.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.011
Yo, Earl!

09:44.083 --> 09:45.847
What?!

09:45.918 --> 09:48.353
Hey! You're fired, ya butt!

09:53.759 --> 09:56.888
I'm so glad everything's
back to normal.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.727
Thanks for all your help, Finn.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.426
Oh! You're welcome.

10:00.499 --> 10:01.865
But, um...

10:01.934 --> 10:03.027
What is it, Finn?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.367
Well, do you, uh...

10:05.438 --> 10:08.431
do you want to hug some more?

10:08.507 --> 10:10.840
What? Finn, you silly.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.675
That was like five years ago.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.681
You really got to move on.

10:15.748 --> 10:19.082
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

10:19.151 --> 10:22.144
Such a silly boy.

10:26.225 --> 10:27.818
Hello.

10:27.893 --> 10:29.486
Hey, man. What's the status?

10:29.562 --> 10:30.996
Bad news, man.

10:31.063 --> 10:32.998
I... I got dumped.

10:33.065 --> 10:35.000
Aw, I'm sorry, Finn.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.935
But look, man, let me share
with you a little secret

10:38.004 --> 10:40.269
on how to win the
heart of a princess.

10:40.339 --> 10:42.934
It's not easy, but you
have to be persistent.

10:43.009 --> 10:45.638
You might have to
defeat a demon lord

10:45.711 --> 10:47.680
and warp through several worlds,

10:47.747 --> 10:50.478
but once you do, you walk
up the wizard stairs

10:50.549 --> 10:52.711
and produce your magic key
you got in the water world

10:52.785 --> 10:54.720
and unlock the chamber door.

10:54.787 --> 10:57.552
Then walk right up
to the princess

10:57.623 --> 10:59.854
and you give her a smooch.

10:59.925 --> 11:01.359
Yes!

11:01.427 --> 11:02.827
Does that make sense?

11:02.895 --> 11:04.693
Yeah, man. I see
what you're saying.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.357
Thanks, Jake.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.957
Mm-hmm.

11:10.102 --> 11:12.628
