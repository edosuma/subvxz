WEBVTT

00:01.661 --> 00:03.561
You really wanna ask me
who do I work for.

00:03.662 --> 00:05.462
- Fine. Who do you work for?
- Olivia Pope.

00:06.763 --> 00:08.463
Last season on Scandal.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.402
*** but this is not a law firm.

00:10.436 --> 00:11.736
We solve problems.

00:11.771 --> 00:13.988
(Abby) Manage crises,
save reputations.

00:14.023 --> 00:14.907
(Quinn) Why did she hire me?

00:15.041 --> 00:17.075
(Huck) Olivia Pope fixes things.
That's who she is.

00:17.109 --> 00:18.743
You need fixing.

00:18.778 --> 00:21.112
Everyone in this office
needs fixing.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.447
Quinn, state your name
for the record.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.116
You don't have to answer that.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.251
Her name isn't actually
Quinn Perkins.

00:26.285 --> 00:27.452
(Harrison and Abby)
Who the hell is she?

00:27.486 --> 00:28.870
(Man) Well, as far as we know,

00:28.921 --> 00:30.755
Quinn Perkins didn't
exist until 2008.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.656
(David) I'm an assistant
U.S. attorney, Liv.

00:32.674 --> 00:34.209
I prosecute crime.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.994
So at some point, even with
you, I gotta do my job.

00:37.012 --> 00:38.263
(David) I ran her prints.

00:38.297 --> 00:39.664
Don't worry.
I did it myself.

00:39.682 --> 00:41.299
Which is a good thing, because
otherwise, there would be

00:41.333 --> 00:43.668
about half a dozen U.S. agencies
looking for her.

00:43.686 --> 00:46.654
Do you want to tell them
who you are or should I?

00:46.689 --> 00:48.339
(Cyrus) You're having
an affair with Olivia Pope.

00:48.357 --> 00:49.524
I am not having...

00:49.558 --> 00:50.859
"Having," "had."
Don't Clinton me with words.

00:50.893 --> 00:53.611
Something happened
between you and Olivia.

00:53.646 --> 00:55.563
A man who isn't president
can divorce his wife.

00:55.614 --> 00:56.848
Fitz...

00:56.866 --> 00:58.900
A man who isn't president
can have a life...

00:58.951 --> 01:01.736
The life he wants,
the life he's always wanted.

01:01.787 --> 01:03.738
Some men aren't meant
to be happy.

01:03.789 --> 01:05.239
They're meant to be great.

01:05.291 --> 01:07.242
(Mellie) I'm gonna need
to take my husband back,

01:07.293 --> 01:10.194
because clearly I have to do
everything myself from now on.

01:10.212 --> 01:13.081
I was on my way, but Olivia
convinced me I was needed here,

01:13.132 --> 01:15.867
especially at such a fragile time,
given that I'm newly pregnant.

01:15.885 --> 01:17.034
(Fitz) Who are you right now?

01:17.052 --> 01:19.137
The woman who got you elected.

01:19.171 --> 01:21.256
So go be the man I voted for.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.650 --> 01:33.768
Well, I was thinking yellow,

01:33.803 --> 01:35.219
but if it's a boy, the
press will make an issue

01:35.237 --> 01:36.688
of a boy with a yellow nursery.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.422
So we could do primary colors.

01:38.441 --> 01:42.243
Red is strong, patriotic.
Fitz, are you listening?

01:42.278 --> 01:43.278
What?

01:43.312 --> 01:44.462
I think Kimberly Mitchell
will like red.

01:44.597 --> 01:46.697
DNC's logo
for America's baby is red.

01:46.715 --> 01:47.999
A few of the other networks
are going with blue,

01:48.033 --> 01:50.851
but that's just foolish until
we reveal the sex of the baby.

01:51.202 --> 01:52.970
(Sighs) I should've taken
Martha Stewart up on her offer

01:53.004 --> 01:54.188
to decorate the nursery.

01:54.122 --> 01:55.773
Red is all right
for a nursery, isn't it?

01:55.807 --> 01:57.841
It isn't too nontraditional.

01:57.875 --> 01:58.676
I don't know.

01:58.710 --> 02:00.144
(Sighs)

02:00.178 --> 02:01.778
Kimberly Mitchell is coming.

02:01.796 --> 02:04.047
She's coming, Fitz, here,
to talk to us

02:04.081 --> 02:05.165
about America's baby.

02:05.699 --> 02:06.166
Amer... for God s...

02:06.200 --> 02:07.317
What?

02:07.335 --> 02:08.435
I am working, Mellie.

02:08.469 --> 02:09.553
You're staring out the window.

02:09.586 --> 02:11.121
Because you are here.

02:11.139 --> 02:13.323
(Sighs)

02:13.957 --> 02:15.524
Are you moving on east Sudan?

02:15.542 --> 02:16.959
I am not discussing
foreign policy with you.

02:16.994 --> 02:19.295
The aircraft carriers have been
on standby for two weeks.

02:19.329 --> 02:21.464
Son of a...
What's the delay, Fitz?

02:21.482 --> 02:22.732
Move them off the east Sudan coast.

02:22.766 --> 02:24.016
Show some power.

02:24.051 --> 02:25.952
Make Kinyazi realize
you mean business.

02:25.986 --> 02:29.472
America is not having a baby.
We are... you and me.

02:29.506 --> 02:31.223
America's baby?
For God sakes, Mellie.

02:31.257 --> 02:33.643
Everything is not
a political move.

02:35.645 --> 02:38.597
Honey, you are not some
toothless mechanic from Indiana,

02:38.631 --> 02:40.699
and I am not some chunky girl
from a trailer park.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.083
We didn't fall in love

02:42.102 --> 02:43.969
and get drunk and do it
in the back of a pickup truck.

02:44.003 --> 02:46.688
This baby, bless its heart,
is not ours.

02:46.722 --> 02:49.224
This baby
is our patriotic duty.

02:49.259 --> 02:52.843
This baby was conceived
in service to our country.

02:52.878 --> 02:55.063
This is America's baby.

02:55.497 --> 02:56.747
And Kimberly Mitchell is coming

02:56.799 --> 02:58.216
to watch us find out
whether it's a boy or a girl

02:58.250 --> 03:00.268
because you are the leader
of the free world

03:00.302 --> 03:01.352
and you couldn't keep
your pants zipped

03:01.386 --> 03:02.837
and your hands to yourself.

03:02.871 --> 03:04.088
This baby
is my way of giving you

03:04.123 --> 03:05.773
a little political bang
for your buck.

03:05.808 --> 03:08.693
So tell me, do you like the red

03:08.727 --> 03:11.812
or do you like the yellow?

03:11.830 --> 03:13.181
Red.

03:13.215 --> 03:15.833
Great. Me too.

03:16.752 --> 03:18.953
(Huffs)

03:20.489 --> 03:22.857
(Camera shutter
and projector clicking)

03:22.891 --> 03:24.725
â™ª

03:24.760 --> 03:27.845
(Protesters
shouting indistinctly)

03:28.696 --> 03:30.814
(Man) There she is!

03:30.865 --> 03:31.982
What is Ms. Dwyer's
state of mind

03:32.033 --> 03:33.233
after six months
of federal detention?

03:33.267 --> 03:34.785
What does she think about
her new nickname...

03:34.836 --> 03:35.919
"The molotov mistress"?

03:35.954 --> 03:37.087
Do you think
she fancied fire play

03:37.121 --> 03:38.672
during sex with her boyfriend?

03:38.706 --> 03:40.090
We've heard the government feels
very confident in their case.

03:40.141 --> 03:41.425
Insiders are calling it
a slam dunk.

03:41.476 --> 03:43.343
Oh, I'm sure they are, bill.

03:43.361 --> 03:44.844
But I find that
a bit premature,

03:44.862 --> 03:47.047
given that we've just started
hearing opening statements.

03:47.081 --> 03:48.298
If I were
the U.S. attorneys office,

03:48.333 --> 03:50.050
I think I'd stay away
from sports metaphors.

03:50.068 --> 03:52.019
They're not the most
athletic group now, are they?

03:52.053 --> 03:53.453
(Woman) Look,
all I'll say right now is,

03:53.488 --> 03:55.405
everyone on the defense team
is very much looking forward

03:55.439 --> 03:56.489
to making our case.

03:57.342 --> 03:59.326
(Handcuffs clicking)

03:59.360 --> 04:02.329
We have no doubt
justice will be served.

04:02.347 --> 04:03.764
(Woman) She killed seven people!
Where's their justice?

04:03.798 --> 04:06.249
(Man) The molotov mistress
should burn for this!

04:10.370 --> 04:13.355
My client, Lindsay Dwyer,
will be proven innocent.

04:13.407 --> 04:16.325
(Reporters all shouting at once)

04:16.375 --> 04:17.993
(Protesters
shouting indistinctly)

04:18.028 --> 04:21.096
(Buzzer sounds)

04:21.130 --> 04:24.016
Ready for court, Ms. Dwyer?

04:24.050 --> 04:26.986
(Keys jangle)

04:28.522 --> 04:30.989
(Camera shutter
and projector clicking)

04:31.007 --> 04:33.042
Ready.

04:59.202 --> 05:01.186
Two days later, Ms. Dwyer

05:01.204 --> 05:02.988
calmly wrapped a bomb in a box

05:03.022 --> 05:04.790
and mailed it to her
boyfriend's office.

05:04.825 --> 05:06.959
And when Jesse Tyler
opened that box,

05:06.977 --> 05:08.661
he and six of his coworkers

05:08.695 --> 05:10.596
were blown to bits.

05:10.630 --> 05:11.997
(Camera shutter
and projector click)

05:13.300 --> 05:15.301
How could they think
<i>i</i> built a bomb?

05:15.335 --> 05:17.503
You know me. I can't operate
the cappuccino machine.

05:17.537 --> 05:19.188
Focus, Quinn.
Tell us what you know.

05:19.222 --> 05:22.208
She'd been dating Jesse
six months.

05:22.242 --> 05:24.009
Jesse banged Elaine,

05:24.044 --> 05:26.979
a programmer who worked
two cubicles over at Cytron.

05:26.997 --> 05:29.832
Quinn... sorry, Lindsay Dwyer...

05:29.866 --> 05:32.067
Saw a text on his phone
that read, and I quote,

05:32.118 --> 05:35.903
"you wore me out.
I think you broke my bed.

05:35.938 --> 05:37.455
Sideways happy face."

05:37.489 --> 05:39.290
She called him immediately,
got his voice mail.

05:39.324 --> 05:41.692
I was drunk. I was angry.
I said things.

05:41.727 --> 05:42.994
You threatened his life.

05:43.028 --> 05:45.396
And then he died.

05:45.430 --> 05:47.031
Motive is clear as day.

05:47.049 --> 05:48.499
So let's poke holes
in this thing.

05:48.533 --> 05:50.434
It's all circumstantial.
There's no signature or receipt

05:50.468 --> 05:51.736
proving it was Quinn who
dropped off that package.

05:51.770 --> 05:53.404
No prints on any of
the bomb components.

05:53.438 --> 05:55.223
Your honor, the defense
would like to make a motion

05:55.257 --> 05:57.708
to dismiss the indictment
for insufficient

05:57.726 --> 06:00.094
and circumstantial evidence
tying my client...

06:00.128 --> 06:01.479
Motion denied.

06:01.513 --> 06:03.498
(Gallery murmuring)

06:03.532 --> 06:07.084
Look, I can stomp on the evidence
till I'm blue in the face,

06:07.102 --> 06:08.936
but the question
we still can't answer is,

06:09.971 --> 06:11.171
if she didn't do it...

06:11.222 --> 06:12.989
Why did you run?

06:12.990 --> 06:14.941
I was scared.

06:14.976 --> 06:16.810
Look, I went home, and my
apartment was surrounded...

06:16.844 --> 06:19.579
Cops and FBI agents
taking out all my stuff.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.531
A woman standing outside told me
that the girl who lived there

06:21.566 --> 06:24.017
blew up a building,
killed seven people.

06:24.068 --> 06:26.335
But if you were innocent, you
just could've called a lawyer.

06:26.370 --> 06:27.570
You did work with
a bunch of 'em.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.038
Also I hear they're
in the phone book.

06:29.073 --> 06:30.873
Enough. She thought
she was being framed.

06:30.907 --> 06:33.142
It makes no sense.
Do you buy it?

06:33.176 --> 06:34.576
No question she's lying
about her alibi.

06:34.610 --> 06:36.378
But I have a hard time buying
her as some unabomber freak

06:36.396 --> 06:38.230
who can mix Clorox
and toothpaste

06:38.281 --> 06:39.214
and blow up
half an office park.

06:39.249 --> 06:40.899
- No offense, Huck.
- None taken.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.485
Olivia obviously
knows something we don't.

06:43.503 --> 06:44.720
Stephen would've been able
to get it out of her.

06:44.754 --> 06:46.121
Stephen's gone.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.423
And now she's drowning.

06:48.441 --> 06:49.158
I freaked.

06:49.292 --> 06:51.676
I checked in
to the first motel I could find.

06:51.710 --> 06:53.144
I-I needed to think.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.380
Look, and then suddenly,
someone knocked me out,

06:55.414 --> 06:57.348
and a couple days later,
I woke up in a D.C. hotel

06:57.399 --> 06:59.033
with this new identity.

06:59.067 --> 07:01.302
Passport, birth certificates,
social security card...

07:01.320 --> 07:03.237
Those things don't come easy
or cheap.

07:03.255 --> 07:05.273
When I woke up,
they were all there,

07:05.307 --> 07:06.775
just...

07:06.809 --> 07:08.209
Laid out for me.

07:08.227 --> 07:09.611
A whole new life.

07:09.645 --> 07:11.646
If you tell me what you know
about the girl,

07:11.664 --> 07:13.431
maybe I can help.

07:13.465 --> 07:14.816
She didn't do it.

07:14.850 --> 07:16.251
Okay.

07:16.385 --> 07:18.620
How do you know that?

07:22.107 --> 07:23.924
Liv, you gotta give me
something, anything.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.759
For God sakes,
I'm the prosecuting attorney.

07:25.794 --> 07:28.195
If anyone even knew
I was here...

07:28.229 --> 07:31.415
If I take this to trial,
you know what'll happen.

07:31.449 --> 07:32.716
You'll make your career.

07:32.751 --> 07:35.586
I'll eviscerate her.
I'll have to.

07:35.620 --> 07:38.389
You wear your hat.
I'll wear mine.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.675
Dr. Brown, this dissociative
fugue state you described,

07:41.710 --> 07:43.811
the one the defense claims explains

07:43.845 --> 07:46.196
her magical travels
from California to D.C.,

07:46.231 --> 07:48.965
have you ever witnessed
this condition?

07:48.999 --> 07:49.649
No.

07:49.684 --> 07:51.234
In the last hundred years,

07:51.285 --> 07:53.419
how many of these fugue states
are on record?

07:53.453 --> 07:55.655
Well, uh, none
that I've heard of.

07:55.689 --> 07:57.173
None?

07:57.208 --> 07:58.725
So we're witnessing
medical history.

07:58.759 --> 08:01.728
How exciting. And how convenient
for the defendant.

08:01.762 --> 08:02.979
Objection.

08:03.030 --> 08:04.263
(Olivia) What about
putting her on the stand?

08:04.281 --> 08:05.431
She's the girl next door.
She's likable.

08:05.466 --> 08:06.832
It might be our best shot.

08:06.850 --> 08:07.967
No, we do that,
we open her up to cross

08:08.002 --> 08:09.419
and expose the gaping holes
in her story.

08:09.453 --> 08:10.803
We find whoever set her up
with her new life,

08:10.838 --> 08:12.255
whoever brought her to D.C.

08:12.289 --> 08:13.606
She says she never even
saw the guy's face.

08:13.624 --> 08:15.841
Because she made him up.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.160
She's lying to us.

08:17.211 --> 08:18.444
Lindsay Dwyer had the motive.

08:18.462 --> 08:20.346
Lindsay Dwyer had the means.

08:20.381 --> 08:22.448
And after she murdered
these seven people,

08:22.483 --> 08:25.902
Lindsay Dwyer ran away, changed
her name to Quinn Perkins,

08:25.953 --> 08:27.403
and started a new life,

08:27.454 --> 08:30.089
like nothing ever happened.

08:30.923 --> 08:31.841
Fun's over.

08:31.842 --> 08:33.960
Now is the time
to hold her responsible.

08:33.994 --> 08:35.495
Now is the time
for Lindsay Dwyer

08:35.529 --> 08:38.748
to stop playing games
and pay for her crimes.

08:39.399 --> 08:41.232
I'm asking
for the death penalty,

08:41.268 --> 08:44.687
because that woman
is a cold-blooded murderer,

08:44.738 --> 08:46.856
and I believe she deserves it.

08:46.907 --> 08:50.142
And by the time
we're done here,

08:50.160 --> 08:52.811
I'm pretty sure
that you'll agree with me.

08:52.829 --> 08:55.814
(Gallery murmuring)

09:03.865 --> 09:05.098
(Projector
and camera shutter click)

09:11.521 --> 09:13.472
Kimberly Mitchell is coming.

09:13.506 --> 09:15.474
America gets their news
from Kimberly Mitchell.

09:15.508 --> 09:16.809
America eats dinner
with Kimberly Mitchell.

09:16.843 --> 09:17.977
Be nice to her.

09:18.011 --> 09:19.145
Kimberly Mitchell.

09:19.179 --> 09:20.563
Kimberly Mitchell is good.
It's good.

09:20.614 --> 09:22.347
Is it? Because I thought
we were running a country here.

09:22.365 --> 09:24.349
You need it after
the "New York Times" thing,

09:24.367 --> 09:25.851
which I told you...

09:25.869 --> 09:27.403
The man should get
to take a vacation.

09:27.454 --> 09:29.205
Yeah, at his ranch,
behind gates,

09:29.239 --> 09:31.323
where the public can't see
how rich he is.

09:31.357 --> 09:32.491
He's the leader
of the free world.

09:32.525 --> 09:33.692
He's not
supposed to be successful?

09:33.710 --> 09:35.194
He's supposed to be poor?
Man of the people.

09:35.212 --> 09:36.962
Man of the people.
Name me one president...

09:36.997 --> 09:38.765
- Abraham Lincoln.
- Abraham Lincoln?

09:38.799 --> 09:41.834
He was on a yacht, Cyrus.
It had a crew of 14

09:41.868 --> 09:43.335
and was trailed
by a coast guard vessel

09:43.369 --> 09:44.870
housing eight secret
service agents

09:44.888 --> 09:46.872
and a special diving team
in case he fell overboard.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.925
The economy is in a freefall.
People are hungry and jobless.

09:49.976 --> 09:51.260
They don't want Donald Trump.
They want...

09:51.311 --> 09:52.428
Abraham Lincoln.

09:52.479 --> 09:54.046
Abraham Lincoln.

09:54.064 --> 09:55.931
Kimberly Mitchell. Okay.

10:00.887 --> 10:02.554
He's gonna invade east Sudan?

10:02.572 --> 10:04.273
We haven't decided.

10:04.324 --> 10:06.525
He invades, he's gonna get
his ass kicked by the democrats.

10:06.559 --> 10:08.527
- We haven't decided yet.
- <i>He</i> hasn't decided.

10:08.561 --> 10:09.862
They're
beheading children, Liv.

10:09.896 --> 10:12.898
The CIA reports say
little kids, 4 or 5 years old.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.950
Not American kids, but still,

10:15.001 --> 10:16.535
the heads of kindergartners
are piling up in east Sudan.

10:16.569 --> 10:17.703
I've decided.

10:17.737 --> 10:18.938
Then don't push him.
You push him...

10:18.956 --> 10:20.106
You lose him. I know.

10:22.175 --> 10:24.043
(Chuckles)

10:24.077 --> 10:25.744
What?

10:25.762 --> 10:27.463
Five minutes every other monday
in the park isn't enough.

10:27.514 --> 10:29.181
Cy...

10:29.216 --> 10:30.466
- You know that man better
than anyone. - Cy...

10:30.517 --> 10:31.634
- He responds to you. Talk to him.
- No.

10:31.685 --> 10:32.801
I'll talk to him.
Maybe see if...

10:32.853 --> 10:34.687
Stephen quit.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.021
He moved to Boston,
married Georgia.

10:36.056 --> 10:38.691
He's gonna be, I don't know,
a normal person.

10:38.725 --> 10:39.808
What does that have to do...

10:39.860 --> 10:40.976
People move on.

10:41.027 --> 10:42.144
Liv...

10:42.195 --> 10:43.262
I have to go.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.596
(Sighs) Be nice to her...

10:44.614 --> 10:46.732
I'll be nice
to Kimberly Mitchell.

10:52.255 --> 10:55.207
(Projector and
camera shutter clicking)

10:55.242 --> 10:58.110
(Abby) Look, I obviously don't
have all the information

10:58.128 --> 10:59.444
about why Quinn's
so important to you.

10:59.462 --> 11:00.779
You'll probably never tell us.

11:00.797 --> 11:02.114
Personally,
I'm not happy about it.

11:02.132 --> 11:04.216
I can live with it,
but at this point,

11:04.251 --> 11:06.752
we're spinning our wheels.
We're gonna lose this, Liv.

11:06.786 --> 11:07.920
Then let's get started
on that jury reading.

11:07.954 --> 11:09.088
I want to know where we stand.

11:09.122 --> 11:10.589
(Knocks)

11:10.623 --> 11:12.591
Olivia Pope, Associates?

11:12.625 --> 11:14.260
And you are?

11:14.294 --> 11:16.061
I'm an aide to congressman Shaw.
The great state of Rhode Island?

11:16.079 --> 11:17.897
He told me to get you
and your associates.

11:17.931 --> 11:19.031
He's got a problem.

11:19.065 --> 11:20.332
I don't get summoned.
Clients come to me.

11:20.350 --> 11:21.901
He can't come to you.

11:21.935 --> 11:23.402
The problem...
It's in his office.

11:23.436 --> 11:25.287
There is a really big problem
in his office,

11:25.322 --> 11:26.655
and if you don't come, then
I am probably losing my job

11:26.690 --> 11:28.173
and going back

11:28.208 --> 11:31.442
to the... the... the great state
of Rhode Island.

11:32.711 --> 11:34.912
If I'd made a decision
to go to war in east Sudan,

11:34.947 --> 11:37.581
I'd be talking to my generals
instead of you, Mr. President.

11:37.599 --> 11:38.883
And a united front

11:38.917 --> 11:41.769
is the quickest way out of
this mess, don't you agree?

11:41.820 --> 11:44.622
We all have interests
in the region...

11:44.656 --> 11:46.290
All right.

11:46.325 --> 11:47.658
Good night.

11:47.692 --> 11:49.994
- Russia?
- France.

11:50.012 --> 11:51.162
(Chuckles)

11:51.180 --> 11:52.480
I find it's easier
to unite our allies

11:52.514 --> 11:55.299
and get congress on
board when I'm not busy

11:55.334 --> 11:56.851
showing off a baby crib
to Kimberly Mitchell.

11:57.202 --> 11:58.285
Well, that baby is getting us

11:58.320 --> 12:00.054
piles and piles
of political capital,

12:00.088 --> 12:01.505
enough to fill fort knox.

12:01.539 --> 12:02.857
Mellie's approvals
are in the high 80s.

12:02.891 --> 12:04.141
Yeah?
Where are mine this week?

12:04.175 --> 12:05.292
Mid 50s.

12:05.343 --> 12:07.261
Low mid 50s, high 40s.

12:07.295 --> 12:10.013
Nothing a splendid
little war wouldn't fix.

12:10.047 --> 12:10.615
Am I right?

12:10.649 --> 12:12.099
I hadn't considered that,
but come to think of it,

12:12.134 --> 12:13.918
Teddy Roosevelt
did get a second term.

12:13.952 --> 12:15.386
We're talking about
American lives.

12:15.420 --> 12:16.720
Don't be cute.

12:16.754 --> 12:18.055
(Groans) Listen, I don't
like this baby parade

12:18.073 --> 12:19.373
any more than you do.

12:19.407 --> 12:20.991
It's a pain in the ass
and distracting as hell,

12:21.025 --> 12:24.695
but saving the union wasn't
Lincoln's only concern either.

12:24.729 --> 12:26.163
Can't hurt to be
a man of the people,

12:26.198 --> 12:28.449
especially in the flyovers.

12:30.985 --> 12:32.269
How is she?

12:32.303 --> 12:34.938
Man of the people?

12:34.973 --> 12:36.774
That only comes
from one person.

12:37.608 --> 12:38.841
She's good.

12:38.876 --> 12:40.977
She's busy, you know.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.649
(Projector
and camera shutter clicking)

12:47.384 --> 12:48.218
Olivia Pope.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.286
And all this time, I thought
I'd never have to meet you.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.371
What can we do for you
this evening, congressman Shaw?

12:52.406 --> 12:54.456
The thing is,
my desk clock stopped.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.024
Mm. It's lucky
we came to you then.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.560
I went to change the
batteries, and when I did,

12:57.594 --> 12:58.861
I found this.

12:59.695 --> 13:00.962
It's a live view C.C.D.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.364
motion-activated
wireless transmitter,

13:02.398 --> 13:04.848
- 2.4 gigahertz, .00...
- Use your words.

13:04.967 --> 13:06.134
Someone's been watching you.

13:06.168 --> 13:07.686
Any movement in the room
turns on the camera,

13:07.737 --> 13:09.437
records what you're doing,
even if the lights aren't on,

13:09.472 --> 13:10.772
then transmits the signal

13:10.790 --> 13:12.190
to whoever has
the camera's I.P. address.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.458
- So that could be...
- Anyone with a computer.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.193
Anyone with a smartphone.
Anyone at all.

13:15.244 --> 13:17.328
(Olivia) Congressman,
do you have any enemies?

13:17.379 --> 13:18.662
Anyone who might want to catch
you doing anything improper

13:18.697 --> 13:19.980
or even just embarrassing?

13:19.998 --> 13:21.265
You work in this town.

13:21.299 --> 13:22.600
Show me a politician
who doesn't have enemies.

13:22.634 --> 13:24.869
Any republican operative
could've put that here.

13:24.903 --> 13:26.270
Hell, any democrat who wants
to score a point off me

13:26.304 --> 13:27.688
on the house floor
could've done it.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.823
But when you found out someone...
republican, democrat...

13:29.857 --> 13:31.491
was illegally recording you
in your office,

13:31.525 --> 13:33.527
you didn't go to security
or capitol police.

13:33.561 --> 13:34.295
You came to me.

13:34.329 --> 13:35.479
Ever take a bribe
in this office?

13:35.514 --> 13:36.780
No, Ms. Pope,
I do not take bribes.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.332
Trade votes
for campaign contributions,

13:38.366 --> 13:39.667
reveal state secrets,

13:39.701 --> 13:40.951
fund raise
on government property?

13:41.002 --> 13:42.703
Of course not.
I don't break the law.

13:42.737 --> 13:44.672
I'm sure you don't,
but yet, here we are.

13:44.706 --> 13:47.675
So if you didn't break the law,
what did you do?

13:49.294 --> 13:51.345
I had...

13:52.714 --> 13:55.516
Relations earlier tonight.

13:56.918 --> 13:58.352
In this office?

13:58.386 --> 13:59.687
On this desk.

13:59.721 --> 14:01.605
(Clatters)

14:11.112 --> 14:13.162
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

14:13.180 --> 14:14.597
Jacob Louis Shaw, 32, single,

14:14.632 --> 14:17.067
first-term congressman from
the great state of Rhode Island.

14:17.101 --> 14:19.002
Trying to make a name
for himself on the hill,

14:19.036 --> 14:20.136
but he's a little too pretty

14:20.171 --> 14:21.571
for the party elite
to take him seriously,

14:21.605 --> 14:23.390
meets Jennifer Price, 35,

14:23.424 --> 14:24.841
junior partner
at Frey and Kimble...

14:24.859 --> 14:26.192
Also single...

14:26.243 --> 14:28.411
At a fund-raiser
at the Smithsonian

14:28.446 --> 14:30.747
at or around 5:30 this evening.

14:30.781 --> 14:31.848
Armani skirt suit,

14:31.882 --> 14:33.016
mid-heel pumps,
tasteful cleavage.

14:33.050 --> 14:34.350
Oh, my God.

14:34.384 --> 14:35.769
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

14:35.803 --> 14:37.587
Let me reiterate that from what
the congressman has told us

14:37.621 --> 14:39.055
and the angle
the camera was placed,

14:39.090 --> 14:41.057
your face was most likely
kept out of frame.

14:41.092 --> 14:42.826
Most likely?

14:42.860 --> 14:44.561
Oh, my God!

14:45.095 --> 14:47.246
The girl didn't do it.
She's mortified,

14:47.281 --> 14:49.398
and a registered democrat,
who would still like

14:49.432 --> 14:51.083
to donate the maximum
personal contribution

14:51.118 --> 14:53.469
to your campaign.

14:54.687 --> 14:56.270
(Huck) I went through
all the D.C. gossip web sites.

14:56.305 --> 14:57.438
One called Capital Spill

14:57.473 --> 14:58.756
just bought
a bunch of bandwidth.

14:58.791 --> 14:59.891
They're expecting
extra traffic.

14:59.925 --> 15:01.392
The right-wing blog?
What does that mean?

15:01.427 --> 15:02.311
They're launching
something big.

15:02.345 --> 15:04.278
Something that'll bring in
a lot of eyeballs.

15:04.313 --> 15:04.913
It means
they want to save America

15:04.947 --> 15:06.548
by streaming your private
parts, congressman.

15:09.251 --> 15:10.835
(Projector
and camera shutter clicking)

15:10.869 --> 15:11.986
Surprised me, Hollis.

15:12.004 --> 15:13.087
Thought you were
strictly old-school...

15:13.122 --> 15:14.455
an oil and gas man.

15:14.489 --> 15:15.623
(Chuckles)

15:15.641 --> 15:16.758
(Southern accent) and solar.

15:16.792 --> 15:17.925
You can't just leave that
to the Chinese.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.310
Y'all should come down

15:19.361 --> 15:20.812
and see what our lab boys
are cooking up with manure.

15:20.863 --> 15:24.248
- Just don't shake their hands.
- I'll warn the energy secretary.

15:24.283 --> 15:26.534
The president close to pulling
the trigger on east Sudan?

15:26.552 --> 15:28.186
He's carefully weighing
the options.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.739
It breaks your heart to read
what's going on over there.

15:31.774 --> 15:33.841
Assure the president
that if, in his wisdom,

15:33.859 --> 15:35.276
he does take us to war,

15:35.294 --> 15:36.778
he won't have to worry about
any disruptions

15:36.812 --> 15:38.246
in the foreign energy market.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.131
No shortfalls or gas lines.

15:40.365 --> 15:43.166
Grandma won't even shiver.
You got my word.

15:43.201 --> 15:44.384
And I know texans
and their word.

15:44.418 --> 15:45.619
I believe you do.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.037
Hollis.
So nice to see you.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.822
Well, look at you...

15:48.856 --> 15:51.658
Plumped out and pleased
as a deer tick on a prize bull.

15:51.693 --> 15:52.876
(Laughs) Oh.

15:53.510 --> 15:54.911
I haven't seen you
since the campaign.

15:54.945 --> 15:56.045
Have you been
behaving yourself?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.096
Oh, I doubt it.

15:57.131 --> 15:58.231
(Laughs)

15:58.265 --> 16:00.583
- Y'all take care.
- Bye.

16:00.618 --> 16:02.001
What did he want now?

16:02.036 --> 16:03.753
To pledge that his company's
fully prepared to realize

16:03.787 --> 16:05.705
even-more-obscene-
than-usual profits

16:05.723 --> 16:07.056
should we go to war.

16:08.107 --> 16:09.391
I can't make
any headway with Fitz

16:09.442 --> 16:11.227
about this east Sudan thing.
He won't hear it from me.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.945
He won't be pressured on this.
Not by you, not by me.

16:12.980 --> 16:15.214
I don't understand him, Cy.
It's a win-win.

16:15.248 --> 16:17.048
No more dead kids
and he gets a second term.

16:17.066 --> 16:18.517
Relax.
Put your feet up.

16:18.551 --> 16:20.485
You got your big Kimberly
Mitchell thing tonight.

16:20.519 --> 16:21.954
You and that belly

16:21.988 --> 16:25.173
have done enough for Fitz's
reelection chances already.

16:28.428 --> 16:29.528
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

16:29.562 --> 16:30.762
(Woman) Our bomb guy
did okay, right?

16:30.797 --> 16:32.014
The jurors
bought his testimony?

16:32.065 --> 16:33.315
(Harrison) Except the
three who were sleeping.

16:33.349 --> 16:34.650
Yeah, well, he's a bomb expert.

16:34.684 --> 16:35.851
He's not an entertainer.

16:35.885 --> 16:37.119
Sadly, we needed
him to be both.

16:37.153 --> 16:38.537
The girl Quinn's boyfriend
was cheating with,

16:38.571 --> 16:40.022
maybe she had a boyfriend
on the side.

16:40.073 --> 16:41.540
We need to find someone else
who would've wanted him dead.

16:41.574 --> 16:42.841
(Harrison) I still think
our best bet

16:42.875 --> 16:44.092
is trying to find
this mystery guy

16:44.127 --> 16:45.811
who changed Quinn's identity.

16:45.845 --> 16:47.095
Maybe he's holing up
with Santa claus.

16:47.130 --> 16:48.330
Have we tried the North Pole?

16:48.364 --> 16:50.182
You checked the tapes
at the Grand District Hotel

16:50.216 --> 16:51.250
where Quinn says she woke up?

16:51.284 --> 16:52.668
Six months ago.
Nothing.

16:52.702 --> 16:54.169
(Harrison) Maybe Houdini
snuck her in through the back.

16:54.203 --> 16:55.420
Could be tapes
of a freight elevator

16:55.455 --> 16:57.522
or loading dock.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.876
Worth a shot.
Go check it out.

17:02.295 --> 17:05.497
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

17:07.031 --> 17:09.333
Even if I wanted to help you,

17:09.367 --> 17:11.201
you're talking about
over two years ago.

17:11.236 --> 17:13.820
We don't keep security
footage that old, man.

17:50.239 --> 17:53.625
- You okay?
- Fine.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.127
Where are we?

17:55.161 --> 17:56.795
Look, I know with Stephen gone,

17:56.829 --> 17:58.246
you haven't, uh...

17:58.281 --> 17:59.748
If you ever want to talk,

17:59.766 --> 18:01.600
you know, to a person
about anything,

18:01.634 --> 18:02.784
I'm a person who talks...

18:02.819 --> 18:05.136
Abby, where are we?

18:05.370 --> 18:07.938
Just talked to Drew Havenwood
at the Capital Spill offices/

18:07.973 --> 18:09.790
roach-infested frat house.

18:09.824 --> 18:11.175
They got the sex tape
by anonymous e-mail.

18:11.209 --> 18:12.276
They're releasing it
tomorrow at noon. (Clatter)

18:12.327 --> 18:13.427
Just in time to get picked up

18:13.461 --> 18:15.095
by the major networks
for the evening Blitz.

18:15.130 --> 18:16.614
Harrison!

18:16.665 --> 18:18.082
We got 24 hours
before Capital Spill

18:18.116 --> 18:20.534
blasts Shaw's naked ass
onto every desktop in America.

18:20.568 --> 18:21.702
Get to court.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.020
File an injunction,
effective immediately.

18:23.054 --> 18:24.388
We can't stop the blog
from releasing the tape

18:24.439 --> 18:25.723
if they got it clean, Liv.

18:25.774 --> 18:27.091
We can try.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.409
In the meantime, we prepare to
spin if this thing comes out.

18:28.443 --> 18:30.694
I want every skeleton
in Shaw's closet dusted off

18:30.745 --> 18:32.379
and lined up
so we can take a good look.

18:32.414 --> 18:33.831
(Abby) You think he's hiding
something else?

18:33.882 --> 18:35.549
Aren't they always?

18:35.583 --> 18:36.700
Where are we

18:36.735 --> 18:38.285
with the Grand District
security footage

18:38.319 --> 18:38.987
for Quinn's trial?

18:39.021 --> 18:40.904
Dead end, but I found a couple
of cams across the street.

18:40.939 --> 18:42.356
It might take a while to get
through their firewall.

18:42.390 --> 18:43.590
- What do you need?
- To get our hands on that sex tape.

18:43.625 --> 18:44.858
Can you take a break?

18:48.496 --> 18:50.430
Oh, you should be in court.

18:50.448 --> 18:52.449
Why aren't you in court?

18:53.934 --> 18:55.402
(Gate squeaks)

18:57.855 --> 18:59.239
(Door squeaks)

18:59.973 --> 19:01.807
What the hell is going on?

19:01.841 --> 19:03.559
Thank you for all
your hard work, Ms. Pope,

19:03.610 --> 19:05.528
but my client no longer
requires your services.

19:05.562 --> 19:06.696
Damn it, Quinn.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.030
Look, he's getting me
a plea deal.

19:08.065 --> 19:09.899
It's my best shot.
It's my only shot. So...

19:09.950 --> 19:11.617
You're fired.

19:17.860 --> 19:19.760
(Olivia) I need to speak
to Ms. Perkins alone.

19:19.811 --> 19:20.877
I'm afraid
that's out of the question.

19:20.895 --> 19:21.862
Which might be interesting

19:21.896 --> 19:23.130
if your permission
entered into it.

19:23.181 --> 19:25.181
- I have to counsel against this.
- Why is he still here?

19:25.182 --> 19:26.117
Give us a moment.

19:27.851 --> 19:29.135
I'll be just outside.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.220
(Papers rustle)

19:32.556 --> 19:34.740
(Door squeaks and closes)

19:34.791 --> 19:36.392
Do I really have to do this,

19:36.426 --> 19:38.494
explain to you who I am,
what I do?

19:38.528 --> 19:40.646
Look, I am on trial
for my life here,

19:40.681 --> 19:42.632
and I'm losing!

19:42.666 --> 19:44.266
And you won't
answer a single...

19:44.300 --> 19:45.568
You won't tell me anything.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.838
You haven't leveled
with me for six months.

19:48.872 --> 19:50.573
What do you want to know?

19:50.607 --> 19:52.591
- Why are you doing this for me?
- You're my client.

19:52.643 --> 19:54.493
- Why do you care?
- I care about my clients.

19:54.528 --> 19:56.412
You knew my name wasn't
Quinn Perkins. How did you know?

19:56.446 --> 19:57.997
- I do my homework.
- How did you know?

19:58.031 --> 20:00.032
- I do my homework.
- That's not an answer!

20:00.083 --> 20:01.517
I don't have to answer to you.

20:01.551 --> 20:04.135
I have to <i>produce</i> for you.

20:04.170 --> 20:07.105
I don't do lost causes
or tilt at windmills.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.840
I don't perform miracles
or the impossible.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.275
I make cold calculations
about difficult situations,

20:11.326 --> 20:13.644
and I do not take on
anything I know I won't win,

20:13.679 --> 20:21.402
and I <i>will</i> win this!
I just need you to trust me.

20:21.436 --> 20:27.241
I promise you, I will not
let you die in here.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.446
(Indistinct conversations)

20:33.464 --> 20:36.032
- We just worked out a plea.
- Oh, really? Congratulations.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.751
For who now? Because you
no longer represent my client.

20:38.769 --> 20:39.869
It's a good deal, Olivia.

20:39.904 --> 20:41.137
Yeah, seven consecutive
life sentences.

20:41.172 --> 20:42.539
For the seven people she killed.

20:42.573 --> 20:44.023
Except you're fired
and there'll be no deal,

20:44.057 --> 20:45.491
if you can even call it that.

20:45.509 --> 20:48.845
You don't ever seem to know
when to leave, do you?

20:51.282 --> 20:52.799
Liv, you're not gonna win this,

20:52.833 --> 20:54.267
and I'm not saying that
to rub your face in it.

20:54.301 --> 20:56.169
I'm saying it because I've
been watching you sacrifice

20:56.203 --> 20:57.637
everything for this girl.

20:57.671 --> 20:58.771
You've been walking around

20:58.805 --> 20:59.906
with the weight of the
world on your shoulders,

20:59.940 --> 21:04.009
and a loss this big, this public...
It could end you.

21:04.044 --> 21:05.778
I'm giving you an out here.
Take it.

21:05.812 --> 21:07.897
Take the plea, Olivia.

21:11.635 --> 21:15.221
I'll see you in court, David.

21:15.255 --> 21:17.206
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

21:17.257 --> 21:18.290
(Harrison) Her client obtained
the sex tape illegally,

21:18.324 --> 21:19.758
your honor.

21:19.792 --> 21:20.960
(Woman) It was attached
to an e-mail.

21:20.994 --> 21:22.995
An e-mail from someone who
obtained the tape illegally.

21:23.029 --> 21:24.296
It's fruit from a poisonous tree.

21:24.331 --> 21:25.664
Which would constitute perfect
grounds for an injunction,

21:25.699 --> 21:27.099
your honor,
except there is no proof

21:27.134 --> 21:28.534
that the tape
was obtained illegally,

21:28.552 --> 21:29.718
which means there aren't
technically any fruits

21:29.753 --> 21:31.570
to deem poisonous.

21:31.588 --> 21:33.589
What if the recording were made
using government property?

21:33.623 --> 21:34.640
It wasn't.

21:34.674 --> 21:36.674
- Can you prove that?
- Your honor...

21:36.692 --> 21:38.125
What are you arguing, counsel?

21:38.176 --> 21:39.310
Copyright infringement.

21:39.344 --> 21:40.428
The government owns
the recording device,

21:40.462 --> 21:41.579
so the government
owns the tape.

21:41.613 --> 21:42.964
The government owns a sex tape?

21:43.015 --> 21:44.982
Why not? It's an entirely legal
business enterprise.

21:45.016 --> 21:46.551
It's pornography.

21:46.585 --> 21:47.402
Come on, counselor.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.421
Who are you to tell Uncle Sam
he can't get his rocks off?

21:51.991 --> 21:55.977
(Typing on keyboard)

21:56.012 --> 21:57.112
Are you hacking?

21:57.146 --> 21:58.296
Would you like me
to explain it?

21:58.330 --> 22:00.115
That would ruin it
for both of us.

22:00.149 --> 22:03.234
Oh, I grabbed the sex stuff
off the Capital Spill server.

22:03.269 --> 22:04.686
It took me less than a minute.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.155
They didn't even have S.S.H.
tunnel protection. Morons.

22:07.189 --> 22:08.456
Thank you.

22:08.491 --> 22:10.258
Abby's got it.

22:11.792 --> 22:12.893
<i>(Panting)</i>

22:12.927 --> 22:14.227
(Door opens)

22:14.262 --> 22:16.213
Anything on the sex tape we
need to be concerned about?

22:16.247 --> 22:17.580
Unh-unh.

22:17.598 --> 22:20.200
No, sirree.

22:20.234 --> 22:21.685
<i>(Gasps)</i>

22:21.719 --> 22:22.819
<i>(Zipper unzips)</i>

22:22.854 --> 22:25.138
You sure?

22:25.173 --> 22:27.557
Watched it four times.

22:27.592 --> 22:29.893
I'll watch it again
just in case.

22:29.927 --> 22:31.027
I don't think that's necessary.

22:31.062 --> 22:32.379
You find anything else on Shaw?

22:32.413 --> 22:33.513
Uh-huh.

22:33.548 --> 22:35.031
- Anything I should know?
- Uh-huh.

22:35.066 --> 22:36.166
(Snaps fingers) Abby.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.801
Oh. Right? Yeah.
We've got a problem.

22:38.819 --> 22:40.237
(Remote control clicks)

22:40.271 --> 22:42.706
When I ask a client to tell me
everything about themselves,

22:42.740 --> 22:44.274
I mean everything.

22:44.292 --> 22:45.608
I did.

22:45.626 --> 22:48.028
Here's 12 things
you didn't tell me about.

22:48.062 --> 22:49.178
(Camera shutter
and projector clicking)

22:49.197 --> 22:50.797
I wasn't filmed having sex
with any of them.

22:50.831 --> 22:51.931
I didn't think
it was important.

22:51.965 --> 22:53.049
Last week, you were
seen with these three,

22:53.083 --> 22:55.201
two of them in hotel lobbies.

22:55.235 --> 22:56.703
It's not like
they're prostitutes.

22:56.737 --> 22:58.021
You think that matters?

22:58.055 --> 22:59.806
It only took Abby two hours
to find these women.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.824
If that tape comes out,

23:01.858 --> 23:03.959
how long do you think
the media's gonna wait

23:03.993 --> 23:05.844
before throwing these
on the sexual bonfire?

23:05.895 --> 23:07.562
I am single.

23:07.580 --> 23:09.431
I date women.
I enjoy their company.

23:09.465 --> 23:10.565
There's nothing wrong
with any of that.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.083
Nothing wrong with it

23:11.134 --> 23:12.267
if you want to be
a one-term congressman.

23:12.301 --> 23:13.402
I'm not an idiot,
Ms. Pope.

23:13.436 --> 23:15.821
I am a grown man
engaging in grown-up behavior

23:15.855 --> 23:17.556
because I have
the freedom to do so

23:17.590 --> 23:19.608
and because I believe
in my right to privacy.

23:19.643 --> 23:21.760
I may be a one-term congressman

23:21.795 --> 23:23.846
with a head of hot air
and lollipop dreams,

23:23.880 --> 23:25.714
but I believe
our elected officials

23:25.748 --> 23:28.450
should actually serve the
people who elected them

23:28.468 --> 23:29.835
rather than spending
all of their time

23:29.869 --> 23:33.488
mudslinging and politicizing
every damn issue in this town.

23:33.522 --> 23:35.607
(Knock on door) (Harrison)
We didn't get the injunction.

23:35.641 --> 23:37.725
I tried everything.
Judge wasn't biting.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.260
Tape's going viral
tomorrow at noon.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.112
So what do we do now?

23:44.383 --> 23:45.866
Now I know you are
even more excited

23:45.884 --> 23:47.936
about what's in this envelope
than I am,

23:47.970 --> 23:49.737
so I won't keep torturing
you two anymore.

23:49.755 --> 23:50.838
Just tell us already.
(Laughs)

23:50.873 --> 23:52.023
All right.

23:52.057 --> 23:53.992
Here we go, everyone.

23:54.043 --> 23:56.511
America's baby is...

23:56.545 --> 23:58.229
A boy.

23:58.264 --> 24:00.281
(Gasps)

24:00.316 --> 24:01.833
A baby boy.

24:01.884 --> 24:05.153
Oh, Kimberly, I am so glad.

24:05.187 --> 24:08.689
I am just so glad, in light
of this wonderful news,

24:08.707 --> 24:12.794
with a baby boy about to
be born into our family,

24:12.828 --> 24:16.281
that my amazing husband
and his administration

24:16.315 --> 24:18.182
believe in doing
whatever is necessary

24:18.217 --> 24:21.051
in east Sudan

24:21.085 --> 24:23.953
to protect those mothers
and their beautiful children

24:23.988 --> 24:27.140
from the truly horrific genocide
that is happening.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.775
(Sighs)

24:28.793 --> 24:30.377
I'm so sorry.

24:30.411 --> 24:33.580
It's just my...
mMy hormones.

24:33.614 --> 24:35.048
(Huffs)

24:38.152 --> 24:40.186
(Kimberly) Have you come up
with any names yet?

24:40.221 --> 24:41.438
Are we not going to discu...

24:41.472 --> 24:42.605
Just...

24:42.640 --> 24:44.023
Oh, Fitz.

24:44.041 --> 24:45.742
I understand that you're upset,

24:45.793 --> 24:48.493
but there is no reason for you...

24:48.527 --> 24:50.461
You ambushed me on live tv,
you tried to force my hand,

24:50.496 --> 24:51.530
and you used our
unborn child to do it.

24:51.564 --> 24:53.332
I simply did what I always do,

24:53.366 --> 24:55.551
which is help you get
the result that you need.

24:55.585 --> 24:56.985
They're saying this might be
the highest-rated news broadcast

24:57.020 --> 24:59.605
on any network in years
so I think it worked.

24:59.639 --> 25:01.040
And I struck just the tone
you need with the public...

25:01.074 --> 25:03.459
Both hands on my belly
as I shared my concern...

25:03.510 --> 25:07.546
No one elected you!
You're not the president!

25:07.580 --> 25:08.981
You don't weigh in
on foreign policy.

25:09.015 --> 25:11.750
Your opinion doesn't matter!

25:11.784 --> 25:13.034
You are the first lady.

25:13.068 --> 25:15.086
Your job is to plant gardens
and decorate rooms

25:15.121 --> 25:17.422
and let them blog
about your clothes.

25:17.456 --> 25:19.374
You're ornamental,
not functional.

25:19.408 --> 25:21.976
So don't come into the oval
and try to use your brain,

25:22.011 --> 25:24.278
because no one cares.

25:30.252 --> 25:32.787
(Sighs)

25:35.674 --> 25:38.760
You always did know just
the right way to hurt me.

25:41.497 --> 25:43.431
Mellie...

25:46.050 --> 25:49.486
I gave up my law career
so you could run for office.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.820
I didn't have to do that.

25:50.838 --> 25:53.106
I know that.
And I appreciate it. I do.

25:53.141 --> 25:55.926
I understand
that you might miss her,

25:55.960 --> 25:57.978
but taking it out on me...

25:58.012 --> 26:00.180
I'm not the one who changed.
You are.

26:00.214 --> 26:02.716
I apologize.

26:02.750 --> 26:04.785
Really.

26:04.819 --> 26:07.170
(Sighs)

26:07.205 --> 26:08.972
I'm sorry.

26:16.063 --> 26:19.282
The baby's kicking.
Do you want to feel?

26:19.317 --> 26:20.550
Yeah.

26:36.517 --> 26:38.801
(Sighs)

26:41.138 --> 26:43.190
I don't feel anything.

26:43.241 --> 26:44.691
Wait for it.

26:44.742 --> 26:46.610
It's coming.

26:51.365 --> 26:52.782
(Sighs)

27:00.716 --> 27:03.101
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Here we go, everyone.</i>

27:03.135 --> 27:05.036

27:07.070 --> 27:08.120

27:09.306 --> 27:10.373

27:10.407 --> 27:11.674
What?

27:11.708 --> 27:12.875
(Fitz) It's me.

27:12.909 --> 27:14.093

27:19.199 --> 27:21.100
Hello?

27:21.134 --> 27:22.868
Hello?

27:25.038 --> 27:28.591
Liv, it's a secure line.

27:30.727 --> 27:32.261
Hello.

27:32.295 --> 27:34.163
Hello.

27:36.933 --> 27:38.200
Hi.

27:38.235 --> 27:40.469
Hi.

27:43.506 --> 27:45.173
You can't call me.

27:45.191 --> 27:46.408
You think I don't know that?

27:46.442 --> 27:47.743
I know that.

27:47.777 --> 27:49.211
I can't call you.
I can't talk to you.

27:49.245 --> 27:51.580
I can't see you.
We can't do this.

27:51.614 --> 27:52.664
We can't do this.

27:52.699 --> 27:54.232
What did I say?
I know.

27:57.670 --> 27:59.554
Liv...

27:59.572 --> 28:01.156
No.
Pretend I'm somebody else,

28:01.190 --> 28:02.424
somebody you hate.

28:03.258 --> 28:04.542
Hang up.

28:04.576 --> 28:05.543
You hang up.

28:18.039 --> 28:19.523
Did you see it?

28:24.162 --> 28:26.380
I'm on my third viewing.

28:26.414 --> 28:28.148
(Laughs)

28:28.183 --> 28:29.283
(Chuckles)

28:30.969 --> 28:33.604
Mellie rang the genocide bell.

28:33.638 --> 28:35.556
The mother of my children,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.191
And the crowd goes wild.

28:37.225 --> 28:38.458
They love her.

28:38.476 --> 28:41.245
She's a rock star.

28:44.682 --> 28:47.550
Are you going to invade
east Sudan?

28:50.871 --> 28:53.156
You know what I think about?

28:53.190 --> 28:54.757
The guys at Dover air force base

28:54.792 --> 28:56.926
who unload the planes
that carry the coffins.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.394
There's a whole section
of the military

28:58.429 --> 28:59.929
dedicated to returning
soldiers killed in combat

28:59.963 --> 29:02.231
to their families for burial.

29:02.266 --> 29:05.034
Right now those guys are sitting
at their desks somewhere

29:05.069 --> 29:06.836
twiddling their thumbs,

29:06.870 --> 29:09.372
collecting a salary
for doing nothing.

29:09.406 --> 29:12.542
Best waste of taxpayer dollars
I can think of.

29:12.576 --> 29:15.310
You have to decide, Fitz.

29:15.344 --> 29:16.628
I know that.

29:16.662 --> 29:18.096
Mellie's genocide quote
is going to be everywhere.

29:18.114 --> 29:19.698
- I know that.
- You want to know what I'd do?

29:19.732 --> 29:21.550
No.

29:21.584 --> 29:24.586
I don't need you.

29:26.422 --> 29:29.224
(Laughs)

29:32.395 --> 29:36.180
Spin it. Get out of it.
Don't let it seem like

29:36.215 --> 29:37.598
she boxed you into a
corner on the war.

29:37.633 --> 29:39.450
Use what she said to scare
the crap out of Kinyazi

29:39.484 --> 29:41.251
and the east Sudanese army.

29:41.269 --> 29:42.720
Let people believe
you orchestrated

29:42.754 --> 29:44.305
Mellie's ringing
of the genocide bell

29:44.339 --> 29:46.790
and buy yourself some time
to decide what you want to do.

29:46.824 --> 29:48.108
Don't let them push you.

29:48.143 --> 29:49.710
There's only one leader
of the armed forces,

29:49.744 --> 29:51.212
and his name
is Fitzgerald Grant.

29:51.246 --> 29:54.398
If you go to war, it's because
you want to go to war.

29:55.734 --> 29:57.251
I hate you.

29:59.654 --> 30:02.089
I hate you, too.

30:04.059 --> 30:06.160
(Sighs)

30:16.521 --> 30:18.355
Good night, Olivia.

30:18.373 --> 30:20.307
(Sighs)

30:50.302 --> 30:51.853
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

30:51.987 --> 30:54.239
How much time we got before
capital spill posts the footage?

30:54.273 --> 30:55.406
About three hours. Why?

30:55.441 --> 30:56.674
- We're gonna release the tape.
- Ourselves?

30:56.693 --> 30:58.077
Right now, before
they get a chance to.

30:58.111 --> 30:59.278
(Shaw) Why would
we want to do that?

30:59.312 --> 31:00.546
We can get ahead of this.
Use it.

31:00.580 --> 31:02.414
It's all about controlling
the narrative.

31:02.465 --> 31:04.600
We e-mail the footage to a
bunch of friendly sources.

31:04.634 --> 31:05.868
We leak it to a
celebrity gossip site

31:05.902 --> 31:06.952
so it doesn't have the
stink of politics on it.

31:07.003 --> 31:08.387
Get ready.

31:08.421 --> 31:09.688
First couple of hours,
there'll be blood in the water.

31:09.739 --> 31:10.823
Our top story,
congressman Jacob Shaw

31:10.857 --> 31:11.990
is dismissing calls
for resignation.

31:12.025 --> 31:13.158
The ethics committee
is meeting today

31:13.209 --> 31:14.710
to discuss how to handle
an alleged...

31:14.744 --> 31:16.545
The guy may not talk softly,
but he carries a big stick

31:16.579 --> 31:17.713
is all I'm saying.

31:17.747 --> 31:18.747
So right off the bat,
you're contrite,

31:18.765 --> 31:20.432
apologize to the voters.

31:20.467 --> 31:22.101
(Reporters shouting at once)
Congressman Shaw, who's the girl?

31:22.152 --> 31:24.570
Look, what I did was wrong.

31:24.604 --> 31:27.406
This office belongs to the people
of the great state of Rhode Island,

31:27.457 --> 31:29.374
and I work very hard days
to represent their interests

31:29.409 --> 31:32.394
in a manner that's worthy
of their trust and respect.

31:32.428 --> 31:34.313
And I'll do everything I can
to restore honor to the office.

31:34.364 --> 31:35.647
We'll use the media attention

31:35.698 --> 31:36.982
to focus on the issues
<i>you</i> want to discuss.

31:37.016 --> 31:38.700
I just want to point out
that while it's my own fault

31:38.734 --> 31:41.220
that I've become
a national joke,

31:41.254 --> 31:44.606
we're talking about my sex life
instead of the 46 million Americans

31:44.641 --> 31:46.291
who are currently
without health insurance.

31:46.342 --> 31:47.576
Thank you.
(Reporters shouting at once)

31:47.594 --> 31:48.710
And then it's up to you.

31:48.744 --> 31:50.028
We toss it down the middle,

31:50.063 --> 31:51.146
hopefully, you'll knock it
out of the park.

31:51.180 --> 31:52.464
Congressman?

31:52.499 --> 31:53.832
I need to make two calls
before we jump off this cliff.

31:53.867 --> 31:55.567
I appreciate you wanting
to notify your staff,

31:55.602 --> 31:56.985
but until we go viral,
it's best if we...

31:57.020 --> 31:58.437
To Jenny, the girl on the tape.

31:58.471 --> 32:00.456
It's not just my ass out there,
it's hers, literally.

32:00.590 --> 32:02.708
And the other call?

32:03.642 --> 32:05.126
My mom.

32:05.160 --> 32:07.261

They got to 'em, Liv.

32:39.844 --> 32:41.444
I finally got into
the security feed.

32:41.479 --> 32:43.246
You can see the Grand
District entrance

32:43.297 --> 32:44.597
clear as day...
(Turns tv off)

32:44.631 --> 32:45.898
But someone erased
a bunch of footage.

32:45.916 --> 32:48.917
There's no sign of Quinn
or the guy that took her.

32:50.170 --> 32:51.920
Where are we
with the jury reading?

32:51.955 --> 32:54.573
I overheard juror number five
on their cell phone.

32:54.607 --> 32:56.108
They're set to hang her.

32:56.142 --> 32:58.377
We're gonna lose.

33:07.303 --> 33:09.188
(Clears throat)

33:13.776 --> 33:15.493
(Quinn) Someone must
have seen something...

33:15.527 --> 33:16.627
Me or this guy.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.045
I woke up across the country
with a new name.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.463
That doesn't just happen.
It doesn't just...

33:19.481 --> 33:20.581
He's gone.

33:20.616 --> 33:24.752
Whoever made you Quinn
Perkins is gone.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.456
(Blows air)

33:28.490 --> 33:29.974
(Sighs)

33:33.362 --> 33:35.046
It sounds like I made it up.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.883
Crazy psycho killer
with a crazy psycho story

33:38.917 --> 33:40.668
to cover her ass.

33:40.719 --> 33:41.869
(Sniffles)

33:43.188 --> 33:45.289
You think I made it up?

33:48.460 --> 33:49.927
It doesn't matter what I think.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.229
It's all about the jury.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.513
They come back with
a guilty verdict, we appeal.

33:52.548 --> 33:53.831
That doesn't work,
we appeal again.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.499
You know how this goes.
You know how we do.

33:55.517 --> 33:57.819
Gladiators in suits,

33:57.853 --> 33:59.720
remember?

34:04.926 --> 34:07.077
Now you know
I gotta make you say it.

34:10.764 --> 34:13.016
Gladiators in suits.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.636
That's right.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.702
Hi, it's me... Olivia.

34:33.719 --> 34:38.291
I know.
It's been a while.

34:38.324 --> 34:39.509
But...

34:40.893 --> 34:43.462
We're gonna lose this thing.

34:45.933 --> 34:49.619
(Woman) That concludes
the testimony in this case.

34:50.652 --> 34:53.121
Your honor, the defense
would, at this time,

34:53.155 --> 34:56.123
move for judgment of acquittal
based on our earlier assertion

34:56.158 --> 34:58.093
that the government evidence
is circumstantial and does not

34:58.127 --> 34:59.427
- Didn't she try something like
this already? - support the charges.)

34:59.461 --> 35:01.029
It's another pro forma
motion before closing.

35:01.063 --> 35:04.365
Defense can try it twice.
It never works.

35:04.667 --> 35:05.934
Motion granted.

35:05.968 --> 35:08.220
(Gallery murmuring)

35:08.454 --> 35:10.188
Except when it does.

35:10.222 --> 35:11.473
What the hell?!

35:11.507 --> 35:13.208
Order.
Your honor,

35:13.242 --> 35:14.509
on what grounds?

35:14.543 --> 35:16.227
I agree that the evidence
presented by the people

35:16.278 --> 35:18.379
has been
largely circumstantial.

35:18.414 --> 35:19.681
And because of that,

35:19.715 --> 35:21.783
the government has failed
to prove its case.

35:21.817 --> 35:23.368
This trial is concluded.

35:23.419 --> 35:25.420
This is outrageous!

35:25.454 --> 35:27.555
Order. This... no, I would like
to see you in your chambers.

35:27.589 --> 35:29.641
Counselor, do you want
to be held in contempt?

35:29.675 --> 35:32.693
I said this case is over.

35:32.727 --> 35:35.747
(Gallery murmuring loudly)

35:46.975 --> 35:50.612
(Murmuring continues)

36:10.946 --> 36:13.448
(Indistinct shouting)

36:13.482 --> 36:15.750
I wouldn't go out there.

36:15.784 --> 36:20.204
Every reporter in Washington's
out for your blood.

36:20.239 --> 36:21.372
David...

36:22.307 --> 36:24.208
No, you don't get to do that...

36:24.242 --> 36:25.692
Talk to me like we're still
Ali and Holmes,

36:25.710 --> 36:28.546
sparring partners by day,
drinking buddies by night.

36:28.580 --> 36:30.664
What happened today
wasn't sparring.

36:30.698 --> 36:31.916
It was me putting
on boxing gloves

36:31.950 --> 36:33.317
and getting stomped
on by Godzilla

36:33.351 --> 36:35.652
before I even entered the ring.

36:35.686 --> 36:37.954
I had the motive.
I had the evidence.

36:37.989 --> 36:39.423
I had the jury.

36:39.457 --> 36:41.992
I won this case.

36:44.145 --> 36:46.363
Let me sneak you out
through the back.

36:46.397 --> 36:47.681
I know you did it.

36:47.715 --> 36:49.182
I don't know how.

36:49.217 --> 36:52.285
But I'm gonna find out.

36:52.320 --> 36:55.188
(Reporters shouting at once)

36:58.509 --> 37:02.095
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

37:02.130 --> 37:03.997
(Door closes)

37:05.231 --> 37:07.766
So we need to talk about...

37:07.784 --> 37:09.335
Back channel
to the east sudanese.

37:10.569 --> 37:13.605
Tell them Mellie's statement
was part of a P.R. strategy

37:13.639 --> 37:15.690
orchestrated by me to rally
the country and our allies

37:15.725 --> 37:16.942
and show that I am willing

37:16.976 --> 37:19.478
to spend every cent
of my wife's political capital...

37:19.512 --> 37:20.979
all of Fort Knox...

37:21.013 --> 37:22.264
on shutting down
his death squads

37:22.298 --> 37:23.681
and protecting our interests
in the region.

37:23.699 --> 37:25.133
Then leak it to the "Times."

37:25.168 --> 37:26.651
Use the First Lady's
press secretary,

37:26.686 --> 37:28.086
and make sure he's quoted
on record.

37:28.121 --> 37:30.322
I want her office saying
she followed my orders.

37:30.356 --> 37:31.957
It's a good plan.

37:31.991 --> 37:33.692
It'll buy you time.
It's a great plan.

37:33.726 --> 37:35.660
It's not a plan.
It's a cover.

37:35.694 --> 37:37.462
It's a lie.
It's defense...

37:37.480 --> 37:39.781
The consequence of being
sabotaged by my own wife,

37:39.816 --> 37:43.301
which I couldn't help but notice
you looked rather pleased about.

37:43.319 --> 37:44.703
It's getting awful drafty
around here, Cy...

37:44.737 --> 37:46.471
Leaks flowing out,

37:46.489 --> 37:48.072
special interests flowing in.

37:48.091 --> 37:50.242
Why am I playing defense
when that's your job?

37:50.276 --> 37:53.444
Why am I cleaning up your mess?

37:53.478 --> 37:55.478
- Mr. President...
- <i>If</i> we go to war,

37:55.514 --> 37:58.432
it's because I want
to go to war.

37:58.466 --> 37:59.750
I don't give a rat's ass

37:59.784 --> 38:01.385
if my approvals sink below
Charles Manson's,

38:01.419 --> 38:02.686
<i>no one...</i>

38:02.720 --> 38:04.805
Not you, not Mellie,
not America's baby,

38:04.839 --> 38:06.440
not the oil lobbyists...

38:06.491 --> 38:10.961
<i>No one</i> tells me when to
take this great nation to war.

38:10.995 --> 38:13.129
Am I making myself clear?

38:13.163 --> 38:14.431
- Crystal.
- Good.

38:19.854 --> 38:21.187
You want to give me
a time-out?

38:21.238 --> 38:22.872
Fine. Great.

38:22.906 --> 38:24.724
My garden's a weed patch.
I haven't seen James in weeks.

38:24.758 --> 38:26.943
I'd relish the chance
to get home before midnight.

38:26.961 --> 38:28.545
But before I go tend
to my roses,

38:28.579 --> 38:30.797
let me just say,
this plan of yours,

38:30.831 --> 38:33.049
this great plan...

38:33.083 --> 38:34.501
It's not yours.

38:34.535 --> 38:35.985
It's Olivia's.

38:36.020 --> 38:38.872
And as long as we're rewriting
our job descriptions here,

38:38.906 --> 38:41.508
keeping your wife on her leash,

38:41.542 --> 38:43.409
that's not in mine.

38:44.628 --> 38:46.429
(Door opens)

38:46.464 --> 38:49.015
(Door closes)

38:50.349 --> 38:53.235
(Camera shutter
and projector clicking)

38:53.269 --> 38:54.486
Quinn will be released
in an hour.

38:54.537 --> 38:55.837
I want a car waiting.

38:55.872 --> 38:57.973
Full security detail
at her apartment 24/7.

38:58.007 --> 38:59.424
There are protesters
outside the courthouse.

38:59.475 --> 39:01.810
We're not taking any chances.

39:01.844 --> 39:04.713
Really? We're not gonna
talk about what happened?

39:04.747 --> 39:06.815
We asked for acquittal.
Judge acquitted. It happens.

39:06.849 --> 39:07.899
No, it doesn't.

39:07.950 --> 39:09.301
The jury was set to convict.

39:09.335 --> 39:10.885
You see their faces? They were
as shocked as we were.

39:10.903 --> 39:11.920
We won this case.

39:11.954 --> 39:13.421
Mm.

39:13.455 --> 39:14.973
Quinn is going to live.

39:15.007 --> 39:19.377
Our client, a 28-year-old
girl, is going to live.

39:19.412 --> 39:21.413
And despite popular
opinion around here,

39:21.464 --> 39:25.233
<i>that</i> is a good thing.

39:26.602 --> 39:28.687
Seriously?
That trial was a joke.

39:28.721 --> 39:30.455
You know it, I know it,
Olivia knows it.

39:30.490 --> 39:31.790
And the only reason
she won't say it

39:31.824 --> 39:33.225
is 'cause she also knows
a whole hell of a lot more

39:33.259 --> 39:35.476
than she's letting on.

39:36.863 --> 39:38.547
What do you think, Huck?

39:38.581 --> 39:40.966
Ready to work across the hall
from the molotov mistress?

39:41.000 --> 39:43.885
Olivia says we trust her,
we trust her.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.387
Company man.

39:49.057 --> 39:50.357
I freaked.

39:50.392 --> 39:52.842
I checked in to the first
motel I could find.

39:52.877 --> 39:54.327
I-I needed to think.

39:54.362 --> 39:56.696
<i>And it was only hours ago</i>
<i>a deadly bomb exploded</i>

39:56.714 --> 39:59.049
<i>at Cytron Software Company,</i>

39:59.100 --> 40:00.817
<i>leaving seven dead.</i>

40:00.851 --> 40:02.752
<i>At this time,</i>
<i>the FBI and local police</i>

40:02.787 --> 40:05.505
<i>are looking for</i>
<i>possible suspect Lindsay Dwyer,</i>

40:05.539 --> 40:07.641
<i>a 26-year-old attorney who...</i>

40:07.675 --> 40:09.609
And then suddenly
someone knocked me out.

40:09.643 --> 40:11.678
<i>was romantically involved</i>
<i>with one of the victims.</i>(Grunts)

40:11.712 --> 40:14.114
<i>Of course we'll have much more</i>
<i>on this story as it develops.</i>

40:14.148 --> 40:16.616
<i>At this time...</i>

40:25.292 --> 40:27.226
(Continues typing)

40:28.044 --> 40:30.345
And a couple days later,
I woke up in a D.C. hotel

40:30.380 --> 40:33.198
with this new identity.

40:33.233 --> 40:35.417
(Gasps)

40:35.452 --> 40:37.486
Mm.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.254
(Sighs)

40:55.922 --> 40:58.073
(Quinn) When I woke up,
they were all there,

40:58.124 --> 40:59.892
just... laid out for me.

40:59.926 --> 41:01.776
A whole new life.

41:40.981 --> 41:44.767
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

41:51.108 --> 41:53.042
(Keyboard clicks)

41:53.077 --> 41:55.345
(Clicking)

42:24.058 --> 42:27.142
She took it,
everything we left for her.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.044
She's good to go.

42:30.180 --> 42:33.016
(Starts engine)

42:33.050 --> 42:35.184
(Gearshift clicks)

42:35.218 --> 42:37.186

camera shutter clicks)
