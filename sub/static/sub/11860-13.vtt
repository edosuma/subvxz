WEBVTT

00:06.667 --> 00:09.083
Lines got to be strong, you see?

00:09.166 --> 00:10.500
No time to think.

00:10.583 --> 00:12.875
Just let it happen.

00:12.959 --> 00:14.792
'Paint's like your blood'

00:14.875 --> 00:16.333
telling the whole world
you've been up here.

00:19.792 --> 00:20.917
Hey.

00:22.208 --> 00:23.834
You alright, little man?

00:25.333 --> 00:27.000
Leon!

00:27.083 --> 00:28.166
Come on, man.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.792
I can't move, Carlos.

00:29.875 --> 00:31.709
Just got to
stop
looking down.

00:31.792 --> 00:34.625
Look up, look
you can do it. Come
on.

00:35.542 --> 00:37.834
I got you.

00:37.917 --> 00:38.750
Look up.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.917
When it's darkest,
men see stars.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.792
When it's darkest,
men see stars.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.458
Ain't no stars, Leon.

00:46.542 --> 00:48.542
Not in my universe anyway.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.083
No stars?
What do you mean, man?

00:51.166 --> 00:52.500
(Carlos)
'Ma kicked me out.'

00:52.583 --> 00:53.834
I tell you that?

00:55.041 --> 00:57.250
Like I don't even exist.

01:05.083 --> 01:07.291
Ain't nobody
bombing like
Blaze.

01:09.625 --> 01:10.917
Take a picture.

01:21.667 --> 01:22.917
By the time I'm done

01:23.000 --> 01:27.208
the whole city's
gonna know my name. Whoo!

02:09.542 --> 02:10.917
What, are you
taking a trip?

02:12.125 --> 02:14.583
No, a friend
bought
a condo in Boca.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.834
Thinking of
investing
myself.

02:16.917 --> 02:18.000
Oh. Looks quiet.

02:18.083 --> 02:20.875
It's probably a
good place to write.

02:20.959 --> 02:23.041
What's that
supposed to mean?

02:23.125 --> 02:25.041
Didn't Hemingway
live in Florida?

02:27.041 --> 02:29.750
I need to talk to
someone
about my son's murder.

02:29.834 --> 02:31.709
Well, I'm Detective Lilly Rush.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.542
My partner, Scotty Valens.

02:33.625 --> 02:34.959
What was your son's name?

02:35.041 --> 02:39.417
Carlos Espinosa.
Killed October 11,
1982.

02:39.500 --> 02:43.458
Someone sprayed paint in
his
mouth till he suffocated.

02:43.542 --> 02:45.875
I, uh, put his
things in
storage.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.792
Last week, motel where
I work in cut my hours.

02:50.875 --> 02:52.458
Can't afford the
storage anymore?

02:53.750 --> 02:56.542
Like most, can't afford
much of anything.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.375
When I was cleaning it out

03:00.458 --> 03:02.250
I found this
in his
backpack.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.208
Yeah, seen these back in Narc.

03:07.291 --> 03:08.917
It's a graffiti
writer's black book.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.166
(Sonia)
'It's why I needed
to talk to you.'

03:11.250 --> 03:12.917
I told the
police
back then

03:13.000 --> 03:14.417
my son was nothing
but a huffer.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.083
He was sniffing paint?

03:16.166 --> 03:19.667
Well, I'd catch him huddled up
with a paper bag and paint cans

03:19.750 --> 03:21.083
stealing money
out of my
purse.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.583
He never talked
about graffiti?

03:22.667 --> 03:24.250
We hardly saw each other.

03:24.333 --> 03:27.250
I had to work three jobs just
to keep a roof over our heads.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.208
You thought he was an addict.

03:29.291 --> 03:31.375
So I kicked him out.

03:31.458 --> 03:34.041
But he was an artist.
Wasn't he?

03:35.208 --> 03:37.625
You ever see Carlos
after he left the house?

03:37.709 --> 03:41.333
He'd sneak in after I left
for work, raid the fridge.

03:41.417 --> 03:42.875
Left his backpack once.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.959
Next day, they
told
me he was dead.

03:47.417 --> 03:49.291
Look at this one.

03:49.375 --> 03:52.500
It was October 11th, 1982.

03:52.583 --> 03:53.750
That's the day
Carlos died, right?

03:54.917 --> 03:56.917
(Scotty)
'T-U-R?'

03:57.000 --> 03:58.667
Looks like part
of a bigger piece

03:58.750 --> 04:00.875
'but there's no
other pictures.'

04:00.959 --> 04:02.625
You know where this
photo was taken?

04:02.709 --> 04:05.291
I wish.
Like to see it myself.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.959
You know who Carlos
was hanging out with

04:07.041 --> 04:09.542
other taggers, uh, friends?

04:09.625 --> 04:11.709
No idea.

04:11.792 --> 04:14.750
Mistake I made kicking
him out of the house.

04:14.834 --> 04:16.083
(Scotty)
'Lil.'

04:19.417 --> 04:20.792
Something here.

04:20.875 --> 04:23.834
Carlos bombed over
someone else's
work.

04:23.917 --> 04:25.500
"NRKE."

04:27.125 --> 04:28.667
Anarchy?

04:28.750 --> 04:29.667
Hmm.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.125
Some kind of insult?

04:31.208 --> 04:32.583
That's a declaration of war.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.667
Hard-core punks
in that world?

04:35.750 --> 04:37.583
No way they're letting
him get away with it.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.291
Well, maybe NRKE got even..

04:40.417 --> 04:42.291
...dropped a bomb
on Carlos.

05:20.625 --> 05:23.166
Carlos Espinosa.
16 years old.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.625
'Body was found
in an alley'

05:24.709 --> 05:28.125
in Kensington
on October 11, 1982.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.458
Autopsy report indicates
a skull fracture.

05:30.542 --> 05:33.417
ME found chips of paint
in the gash on Carlos's head.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.625
Cause of death
was asphyxiation.

05:35.709 --> 05:37.417
Someone bashed his
head against the wall

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
before that paint was
forced down his throat.

05:39.583 --> 05:42.083
Assigned figured another
huffer jumped Carlos

05:42.166 --> 05:44.542
used his own can
of paint against him.

05:44.625 --> 05:47.917
Murder weapon found under some
debris couldn't lift a print.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.917
Well, see if you can trace
the can, locate the
retailer.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.250
Victim had three
healed broken
ribs

05:53.333 --> 05:54.417
at the time of his death.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.709
Well, mom kicked him out

05:55.792 --> 05:57.667
and Carlos was living
on the streets.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.917
(John)
'Lot of ways for a kid
to get hurt out there.'

06:00.000 --> 06:02.166
Any idea where he
racked his
supplies?

06:02.250 --> 06:04.750
Well, mom said she found
receipts in his jean pockets

06:04.834 --> 06:06.375
uh, small stuff like gum.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.417
That's an old trick,
pay for something
cheap

06:08.500 --> 06:10.500
so no one's suspicious,
then shoplift the paint.

06:10.583 --> 06:13.125
Well, the receipts
were from a..

06:13.208 --> 06:14.709
...Harold's Hardware.

06:14.792 --> 06:18.083
I'll show them a photo, see if
maybe someone remembers Carlos.

06:18.166 --> 06:20.458
Had a steady hand.
Clean lines.

06:20.542 --> 06:22.041
Looked into NRKE.

06:22.125 --> 06:25.542
The crew was notorious in the
'80s for violent street
justice.

06:25.625 --> 06:27.041
So, Carlos was
killed in their hood?

06:27.125 --> 06:28.458
Yeah, two blocks
from their clubhouse.

06:28.542 --> 06:30.125
Well, we're going to need names.

06:30.208 --> 06:33.583
I'm meeting with the head of
the Graffiti Removal Commission

06:33.667 --> 06:36.333
Don Bardwill. Been on
the scene three
decades.

06:36.417 --> 06:39.583
Says he knew NRKE up
close and personal.

06:43.834 --> 06:44.834
Curtis, hey.

06:44.917 --> 06:48.625
- Uh, I was wondering..
- Yeah?

06:48.709 --> 06:51.625
How you and your ex
agreed on custody.

06:51.709 --> 06:53.625
That's what you
were wondering?

06:53.709 --> 06:55.542
Well, I wouldn't say
that me and the soul crusher

06:55.625 --> 06:56.834
agreed on anything.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.542
So, you petitioned
for visitation?

06:59.625 --> 07:01.291
What's going on, Kat?

07:02.625 --> 07:04.500
Jarrod sent me a letter.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.667
He got married,
moved back to Philly.

07:06.750 --> 07:10.000
He wants Veronica to stay
with him two weekends a month.

07:10.083 --> 07:11.166
What are my options?

07:11.250 --> 07:12.875
Well, you could play hardball

07:12.959 --> 07:14.500
force him to file
a custody
complaint.

07:14.583 --> 07:16.000
Would Veronica
have to testify?

07:16.083 --> 07:18.208
(Curtis)
'Strong possibility.'

07:18.291 --> 07:19.417
What else?

07:19.500 --> 07:20.792
I don't know.
Sit down with the
guy.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.125
There's probably a
way to work it out.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.166
How do you work it out
with an ex-banger

07:24.250 --> 07:25.917
who wants custody
of your kid?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.333
I could come.
Uh, not as a
lawyer.

07:28.417 --> 07:30.667
You know, just
as
your boyfriend.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.834
- Yeah, okay.
- Mm.

07:32.917 --> 07:36.166
But never said you
were my boyfriend.

07:39.166 --> 07:41.417
(Curtis)
'I'll see you..'

07:41.500 --> 07:43.917
...later. Lil.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.625
- Oh, hey, lover boy.
- We need to talk.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.834
- So talk.
- In private.

07:49.875 --> 07:51.125
Got something
to show you.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.041
- Some..
- Uhm.

07:53.125 --> 07:55.417
Uh, here, give me
a hand, will you?

07:55.500 --> 07:58.417
We-we're looking
for a, um..

07:58.500 --> 08:00.583
...private
criminal complaint.

08:01.792 --> 08:04.709
- Filed by Moe Kitchener.
- That's it.

08:04.792 --> 08:07.625
Against one Lillian Rush.

08:07.709 --> 08:09.500
Hmm. Let's see.

08:09.583 --> 08:12.917
You put a boot on his car.
Harassed his loan officer.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.333
Gave him a night in the
drunk tank with, Tico?

08:15.417 --> 08:16.875
- Yeah.
- He forget anything?

08:16.959 --> 08:18.542
It's not the first
complaint he's ever
filed.

08:18.625 --> 08:22.583
Yeah, but this one's from
the DA's Office, Lil, not IAB.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.000
These guys can prosecute
you for a crime.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.625
Thanks. Got it.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.709
I don't know
what's
going on with you

08:30.792 --> 08:33.333
but, this could
cost
you your career.

08:33.417 --> 08:34.959
You done talking yet?

08:36.667 --> 08:38.083
Hey, you're on your own.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.458
Always have been.

08:42.458 --> 08:45.625
Called me the Graffiti
Gestapo back in the day.

08:45.709 --> 08:46.750
Colorful name.

08:46.834 --> 08:48.500
Cruised around
in my Mercury Monarch

08:48.583 --> 08:50.500
with a gallon
of paint, removers.

08:51.625 --> 08:55.000
People say these kids
are vandals, crooks.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.417
(Scotty)
Wonder why.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.917
Just neglected kids trying
to show the world they exist.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.834
Painting murals
gives them an outlet.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.458
Beautifies the city
in the process.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.208
Yeah, you got that
list we asked for?

09:05.291 --> 09:07.667
NRKE, right?
It's here somewhere.

09:11.750 --> 09:15.250
Turbo 102, this
look
like the same tag?

09:15.333 --> 09:16.959
Judging by the
way
the T's slanted

09:17.041 --> 09:18.291
I'd say it's him, alright.

09:18.375 --> 09:20.125
- Who is he?
- Good question.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.166
Guy's been bombing the
city almost three
decades.

09:22.250 --> 09:24.417
Are you saying he
still hits places today?

09:24.500 --> 09:27.333
Most bombers leave churches
and cemeteries alone.

09:27.417 --> 09:30.250
Turbo's got no respect
for anything or anyone.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.458
Do you know where
this photo was taken?

09:32.542 --> 09:36.166
Hmm, too small to make out any
landmarks. Where'd you get it?

09:36.250 --> 09:39.291
Kid we're looking
into, Carlos
Espinosa.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.917
This was his black book. Went
by
Blaze.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.250
Oh, I know that tag.

09:44.333 --> 09:47.709
You didn't mention
Blaze on the phone.

09:47.792 --> 09:49.166
Is that why you
asked about NRKE?

09:49.250 --> 09:51.166
Why, is there a connect?

09:51.250 --> 09:54.625
Blaze was new on the scene.

09:54.709 --> 09:57.458
NRKE, taught him
a serious lesson.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.458
'What the hell you
<i>hermano?'</i>

10:13.667 --> 10:15.375
Just trying to get
my name on the map.

10:15.458 --> 10:18.083
You got to dis
to get noticed.

10:18.166 --> 10:21.125
Nobody bombs here
without going through me.

10:21.208 --> 10:22.834
This is NRKE's wall.

10:22.917 --> 10:24.750
Fool, I am NRKE.

10:26.333 --> 10:27.750
This is pretty.

10:27.834 --> 10:30.000
It's better than what
was up there. Yeah.

10:30.083 --> 10:32.041
Who is this kid?

10:32.125 --> 10:33.667
'You think
you got style?'

10:33.750 --> 10:35.583
This is my block.
I'm the king.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.583
You'd better get somebody
else to do your writing, man.

10:37.667 --> 10:40.458
You're cocky for somebody
who's about to get his ass
beat.

10:52.166 --> 10:53.500
Turn him over.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.417
I catch you capping
my spot again

10:58.500 --> 11:00.333
I'm gonna feed
you this can.

11:04.125 --> 11:06.625
Hey, get out of here,
narc, or you're next.

11:12.291 --> 11:16.000
It's what happens when you
leave
a bunch of kids on their own.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.125
You call the cops?

11:17.208 --> 11:18.834
Drove straight
to a pay phone.

11:18.917 --> 11:21.417
By the time they got
there everyone was gone..

11:21.500 --> 11:22.625
...including Blaze.

11:22.709 --> 11:24.208
Explains the
broken ribs.

11:24.291 --> 11:27.083
What about the thug? Head
of
NRKE?

11:27.166 --> 11:30.166
Called himself Tut.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.667
One thing I know..

11:31.750 --> 11:35.166
...nobody disrespected
the King.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.166
instrumental music]

11:53.250 --> 11:56.000
Philly's finest
looking
for a new paint
job?

11:56.083 --> 11:58.667
Shop's a step up
from tagging with NRKE.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.166
NRKE.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.625
Haven't heard
that
name in a while.

12:03.709 --> 12:05.166
Understand you were the King.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.667
Took it pretty
serious.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.583
Thought I was bombing
the system, leaving my
mark.

12:09.667 --> 12:12.166
Just a bunch of hoodlums
running on the streets.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.959
Investigating the murder
of Carlos Espinosa.

12:15.041 --> 12:18.542
Went by the tag
of BLAZE back in '82.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.291
Not a bad throw up,
prolly
would've messed him up

12:22.375 --> 12:23.792
real good if I
would've caught
him.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.208
Got a witness says you
were doing exactly
that.

12:26.291 --> 12:29.625
"I'm gonna feed you this can."
Sound familiar?

12:29.709 --> 12:32.667
Look, uh, back in the
day,
thought the only thing

12:32.750 --> 12:35.917
you had in this world was
your name, your
reputation.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.667
Well, toy like
Carlos disses you

12:37.750 --> 12:39.291
you gotta show him you
mean business, right?

12:39.375 --> 12:42.166
Mm-hmm, but the boy came
around a few weeks later

12:42.250 --> 12:44.208
tail between
his legs,
and..

12:44.291 --> 12:47.542
...the King
granted
him a pardon.

12:48.917 --> 12:50.125
Believe this?

12:50.208 --> 12:52.834
Fool's stupider
than I thought.

12:52.917 --> 12:55.333
- I wanna go.
- Come on, Leon.

12:55.417 --> 12:58.709
- You got my back, right?
- Okay, man, yes.

13:03.125 --> 13:05.041
Bring us a
punching
<i>hombre?</i>

13:05.125 --> 13:06.667
It's cool, Leon.
I got this.

13:08.417 --> 13:11.542
Drank too much, disrespected
you, and your whole crew.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.166
Hell, everybody knows the
King's tearing it up all over.

13:19.083 --> 13:20.959
I got a peace offering.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.125
Next time,
bring
better beer.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.375
Come here, man,
I saw your tag

13:34.458 --> 13:36.959
on the Alleghany
water tower.

13:37.041 --> 13:38.542
Going higher next time.

13:38.625 --> 13:41.041
You got a lot of sack,
climbing up there.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.709
Fall off a
roof,
go to heaven.

13:43.792 --> 13:45.625
Highest spot of all.

13:45.709 --> 13:49.208
Say, man, toy like
you needs a crew.

13:49.291 --> 13:50.583
A place to crash.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.542
Throw slo-mo here
some scraps.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.417
Y'all planning
any pieces? Burners?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.166
Come on, man,
this is NRKE.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.917
All-out destruction, man.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.875
You know what I'm sayin'?

14:00.959 --> 14:02.667
You want pretty pieces,
you go get yourself

14:02.750 --> 14:04.250
a graffiti coloring book.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.834
Alright.

14:07.917 --> 14:08.959
Let me think about it.

14:09.041 --> 14:10.333
What's there
to think about?

14:10.417 --> 14:13.500
NRKE reigns supreme,
nobody comes close.

14:13.583 --> 14:14.917
Can we g-go now?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.250
Yeah, man,
jus-just
give me a minute.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.250
Be careful, man.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.750
That chick's dangerous.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.208
Hey. I'm Carlos.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.125
Not anymore.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.375
Now..

14:45.750 --> 14:46.959
...you're mine.

14:48.166 --> 14:49.458
(Carlos)
"Talon"?

14:54.750 --> 14:57.709
Thought he was gonna join
the crew, make me look good.

14:59.208 --> 15:01.125
- And he turned you down?
- Can you believe it?

15:01.208 --> 15:03.458
Thought I was giving him
the keys to the castle.

15:03.542 --> 15:05.542
Now, who was the
kid with Carlos?

15:06.834 --> 15:07.917
Never knew his name.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.083
What about the girl?

15:09.166 --> 15:11.375
Uh, Gina something.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.417
Always writing with
that nasty orange.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.792
- She part of your crew?
- She wanted to be.

15:15.875 --> 15:18.291
Told her she had a
sloppy hand with no
style.

15:18.375 --> 15:22.125
You know how she
got her tag, Talon?

15:22.208 --> 15:24.709
Heard she, uh, clawed
out some guy's eyes.

15:24.792 --> 15:27.500
Tried to warn Carlos,
but once she got it in
you..

15:27.583 --> 15:29.000
...she ain't
never
letting go.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.291
Yeah?

15:36.375 --> 15:38.083
Carlos's last piece.

15:38.166 --> 15:41.750
ID put it under
a complex magnifier.

15:41.834 --> 15:42.750
Get anything?

15:42.834 --> 15:44.458
The wall has
oval-shaped bricks.

15:44.542 --> 15:48.291
There's one place in town with
those bricks the sewer system.

15:48.375 --> 15:50.834
Tagger's MO is to get his name
up where everyone can see it.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.208
Why go underground?

15:52.291 --> 15:53.792
The last piece he ever drew.

15:53.875 --> 15:55.375
(John)
'Chance it could
shed some light.'

15:55.458 --> 15:56.709
Lot of sewers, boss.

15:56.792 --> 15:58.583
Distribute a flyer
with Carlos's photo

15:58.667 --> 16:00.542
and a Polaroid
of his last piece.

16:00.625 --> 16:02.375
PWD workers,
homeless
shelters.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.667
Maybe we get lucky.

16:03.750 --> 16:06.125
You know, I tracked
down
the owner of Harold's.

16:06.208 --> 16:08.834
Said Carlos was seeing
one of his employees.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.500
(John)
'"Gina Lopresi."'

16:10.583 --> 16:11.959
(Lilly)
'Yeah, fired her
once he realized'

16:12.041 --> 16:13.875
she was stealing
all the spray
paint.

16:13.959 --> 16:15.500
You show her photo
to "King Tut"?

16:15.583 --> 16:16.709
ID'd her as Talon.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.041
Will's
tracking
her down now.

16:18.125 --> 16:19.875
Talon, huh?

16:19.959 --> 16:22.375
Well, it's time we
stick our claws in her.

16:29.417 --> 16:32.250
So, you, um..

16:32.333 --> 16:33.792
...moved from Detroit?

16:33.875 --> 16:36.875
Last month. Yeah, finally got
settled, unpacked the last
box.

16:36.959 --> 16:38.750
And got the girls
enrolled in school.

16:38.834 --> 16:40.709
I have two daughters,
Connie and Cassie.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.792
We got a place with
a bedroom for Veronica, too.

16:42.875 --> 16:45.417
- Painted it her favorite
color.
- 'Purple.'

16:45.500 --> 16:48.083
- 'Lavender, baby.'
- Right, lavender.

16:48.166 --> 16:51.041
''Cause apparently
there's a difference.'

16:55.291 --> 16:57.375
Sorry. I gotta go.

17:09.709 --> 17:11.291
<i>Dame.</i>
<i>gracias.</i>

17:13.667 --> 17:17.208
Your mother, she gets
more beautiful every
day.

17:17.291 --> 17:20.041
He does that to get out
of doing the dishes.

17:20.125 --> 17:23.083
Think I don't know
<i>viejo?</i>

17:26.583 --> 17:28.792
How's your knee, Ma?

17:28.875 --> 17:31.083
Mm, Doctor said it's fine.

17:31.166 --> 17:35.458
[telephone ringing]
So, you going to grace us
with your presence on Sunday?

17:35.542 --> 17:37.500
'I'm making
<i>arroz con gandules.'</i>

17:37.583 --> 17:38.875
Oh. Valens.

17:38.959 --> 17:40.583
(Pierson on phone)
'Hey, it's Pierson.'

17:40.667 --> 17:43.291
'Got another purse snatching
outside the Dayley's Market.'

17:43.375 --> 17:45.792
'Same MO.
Older Hispanic lady.'

17:45.875 --> 17:47.417
'Taking her statement now.'

17:47.500 --> 17:51.083
Uh, hold her
till I get there.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.542
- 'Got it.'
- Um.

17:54.875 --> 17:58.792
I'm sorry, Ma, I gotta
take this, it's work.

17:58.875 --> 17:59.875
Hmm.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.750
It's always work
with you, Scotty.

18:01.834 --> 18:04.750
When you gonna
slow down?

18:04.834 --> 18:05.959
Sunday.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.500
<i>Arroz con gandules.</i>

18:16.125 --> 18:19.000
(Will)
'Gina Lopresi?'

18:19.083 --> 18:20.583
Sorry, we're closed.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.208
(Kat)
'Philly PD.'

18:24.166 --> 18:27.166
- What can I do for you?
- Hmm.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.834
Nice stuff for a girl
from the streets.

18:29.917 --> 18:32.959
Graffiti vandal
turned boutique owner.

18:33.041 --> 18:35.375
Graffiti taught me skills.

18:35.458 --> 18:38.834
How to market my name,
resilience, respect.

18:38.917 --> 18:39.917
What's this about?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.583
Know where
this was
taken?

18:44.917 --> 18:46.417
Never seen it before.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.375
- Ever go to the sewer to tag?
- Why would I do that?

18:49.458 --> 18:52.125
To hang with your
boyfriend, Carlos
Espinosa.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.458
Carlos wasn't my boyfriend.

18:55.542 --> 18:57.041
Hmm, you stealing
all that paint

18:57.125 --> 18:59.375
from Harold's Hardware
just for yourself?

18:59.458 --> 19:02.125
I did a lot of crazy
things
when I was a teenager.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.875
Racking paint for a boy
I liked was just one of
'em.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.583
(Will)
'Crazy is a good
way to put it.'

19:06.667 --> 19:08.208
Arrested three
times
for vandalism.

19:08.291 --> 19:09.583
One for agg assault.

19:09.667 --> 19:11.208
The assault was self-defense.

19:11.291 --> 19:12.542
Not the way
the judge saw
it.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.291
My stepfather
used to beat me.

19:14.375 --> 19:17.917
One day he got the idea to
toss
me out a third-floor window.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.834
Clawed his eyes
out to stop him.

19:21.792 --> 19:24.750
Fluorescent orange is
still your signature color.

19:24.834 --> 19:27.542
I like orange.
Is that a crime?

19:28.583 --> 19:30.083
No.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.625
But this is.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.709
Heard he was killed.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.625
I didn't know
it was like this.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.291
Carlos thought
no one could touch him.

19:46.917 --> 19:48.750
He was wrong.

19:48.834 --> 19:50.166
(Carlos)
'Come here, I want
to show something.'

19:54.875 --> 19:57.542
(Gina)
'"Blaze and Talon."'

19:57.625 --> 19:58.959
It looks alive.

20:00.125 --> 20:02.500
'I've never seen
anything like it.'

20:02.583 --> 20:04.125
Your name should
be up high.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.458
I see you.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.792
Yeah, who
told
you to look?

20:12.875 --> 20:16.041
Why don't you just write your
last name up there, too, Leon?

20:16.125 --> 20:18.375
Use the name
I gave you. Turbo.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.041
The fastest tagger in town.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.875
So, what's with you
and speed bump?

20:28.959 --> 20:31.208
Don't say things like
that, alright?

20:31.291 --> 20:32.959
He might start
believing it or something.

20:33.041 --> 20:35.583
Sorry.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.458
He's got a raw
deal, that's all.

20:38.542 --> 20:40.458
Pretty decent of you,
letting him tag along.

20:41.750 --> 20:44.792
Everybody needs someone,
right? Get down! Get down!

20:44.875 --> 20:46.750
- What's wrong?
- Got some cop after me.

20:46.834 --> 20:49.000
He always knows where
I'm at, I don't know how.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.959
He chased me down an
alley with a flashlight

20:54.041 --> 20:55.250
said he was gonna
bash my head in.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.291
- What for?
- I don't know. Guy's
obsessed.

20:57.375 --> 21:00.000
He's always buffing
out my tags.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.792
I catch you,
you're dead, Blaze!

21:01.875 --> 21:03.500
That-that's him! Run!

21:08.583 --> 21:10.000
Carlos was different.

21:11.291 --> 21:13.000
Always taking care
of other people.

21:13.083 --> 21:16.000
This the guy who was
chasing Carlos?

21:16.083 --> 21:17.583
(Gina)
'Could be.'

21:17.667 --> 21:20.500
(Kat)
'Carlos's friend, Leon..'

21:20.583 --> 21:21.875
'...you're saying he was Turbo?'

21:21.959 --> 21:23.625
That's what Carlos
called him.

21:23.709 --> 21:26.667
Said he found him in an
alley,
eating out of the trash.

21:26.750 --> 21:27.917
Where can we find him?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.125
Six feet under
he fell off a
roof

21:30.208 --> 21:31.917
a week before
Carlos died.

21:36.041 --> 21:37.375
Thank you.

21:38.583 --> 21:39.917
We'll be in touch.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.709
So, if Turbo's dead..

21:43.792 --> 21:45.834
...who's using
the tag Turbo
102?

21:47.166 --> 21:48.959
I bet Don Bardwill knows.

21:56.834 --> 21:58.834
Hi. Detective Valens.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.959
Uh, thanks for
waiting, Belen.

22:02.041 --> 22:05.000
Your case is similar to
another case I'm
working.

22:05.083 --> 22:08.208
Yeah, I-I already told that
other young man everything.

22:08.291 --> 22:10.625
But, sorry to put
you
through this
again.

22:10.709 --> 22:13.417
Can you tell me what
<i>por favor?</i>

22:13.500 --> 22:17.125
Hoodlum came out
of nowhere, pushed me down.

22:17.208 --> 22:19.375
Ran off with my pocketbook.

22:19.458 --> 22:20.917
You get hurt?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.542
(Belen)
'Scratched my knee.'

22:24.125 --> 22:25.083
I'm fine.

22:25.166 --> 22:26.792
Did you get a look at the guy?

22:27.792 --> 22:29.792
My eyes aren't so good anymore.

22:29.875 --> 22:33.250
What was he, white,
black, Latino?

22:33.333 --> 22:35.583
All my groceries
are in the trunk.

22:37.375 --> 22:38.583
My ice cream's melting.

22:38.667 --> 22:41.667
Help me, get this
guy off the street.

22:41.750 --> 22:43.333
Stop him from
doing this again.

22:43.417 --> 22:44.959
- I have to go.
- Belen..

22:46.500 --> 22:48.583
...there are other
women
he's done this to.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.166
Women like you.

22:53.542 --> 22:55.208
You've spoken to them?

22:56.875 --> 22:58.083
I..

23:02.375 --> 23:04.000
...I know..

23:04.083 --> 23:05.625
...what he did to you.

23:15.792 --> 23:18.667
I wasn't strong
enough to stop him.

23:24.583 --> 23:26.792
I tried to scream, but..

23:26.875 --> 23:29.417
...he put his hand
over my mouth.

23:31.542 --> 23:34.250
He put his hand
over your mouth?

23:36.500 --> 23:39.667
My husband is the only
man I've ever been with.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.709
'He told me to stop
looking at him.'

23:49.583 --> 23:52.000
That was the only
thing he said to me.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.917
You saw him?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.291
Oh, yes.

24:24.291 --> 24:25.750
Things we gotta do.

24:27.208 --> 24:29.166
Get a nurse to see you.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.291
Uh-uh, I don't
know, no.

24:31.375 --> 24:33.125
Look, anyone
that
cares for you..

24:34.792 --> 24:38.000
...they're gonna
understand
it wasn't your fault.

24:38.083 --> 24:41.041
- I shouldn't have been
there.
- That wasn't your fault.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.709
You hear me, Belen, hmm?

24:52.125 --> 24:53.667
I have to go.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.583
My ice cream's melting.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.834
"Graffiti Gestapo."

25:14.917 --> 25:17.250
You get that nickname
for getting physical

25:17.333 --> 25:18.709
with bombers like Carlos?

25:18.792 --> 25:20.709
'Course not, I was
trying to clean up

25:20.792 --> 25:23.500
the streets, not
take on gangs.

25:23.583 --> 25:25.000
Clean up the streets.

25:25.083 --> 25:26.875
That include chasing kids
with your flashlight

25:26.959 --> 25:28.125
threatening to beat them?

25:28.208 --> 25:29.875
Might have tried
to scare some punks.

25:29.959 --> 25:32.959
You ask me, degenerates
had it coming.

25:33.041 --> 25:36.583
Someone's gotta step up, and do
something about it. Right?

25:36.667 --> 25:38.417
I was taking back our city.

25:38.500 --> 25:42.041
What, by stalking Carlos?
Hunting him down?

25:42.125 --> 25:43.750
Hey now, I never
stalked anyone.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.000
So how'd you always
know where he was at?

25:47.709 --> 25:50.667
I got calls when
kids were bombing.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.291
'Told me where to go.'

25:52.375 --> 25:53.583
Always the same voice.

25:53.667 --> 25:56.834
You saying someone was
ratting out bombers?

25:56.917 --> 25:59.667
Don't know who it
was.
Didn't care.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.291
Made my job easier.

26:01.375 --> 26:04.291
What about Leon? Chasing
these kids around town.

26:04.375 --> 26:07.041
- You finally catch one?
- Don't know any Leon.

26:07.125 --> 26:08.917
Oh, Carlos's little friend.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.083
Took a nosedive 13
stories off a roof

26:11.166 --> 26:13.417
a week before Carlos
was murdered.

26:13.500 --> 26:16.125
Sorry to hear
that,
but like I said

26:16.208 --> 26:18.083
don't know anyone
named Leon.

26:18.166 --> 26:19.125
Want to tell me
why your name's

26:19.208 --> 26:21.041
on his accident
report, then?

26:21.125 --> 26:23.333
It says here that you were
a witness to his death.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.458
(Scotty)
'The date's October 2nd.'

26:25.542 --> 26:28.375
Ten-two.
One-O-two.

26:29.208 --> 26:30.500
'Sound familiar?'

26:30.583 --> 26:33.625
I give you a clue.
Leon's nickname was Turbo.

26:33.709 --> 26:35.667
One-O-two,
the day he died.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.125
Now, you got photos of his
tags all over your office.

26:38.208 --> 26:40.667
You know every single
place that he hit.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.208
(Scotty)
'So tell us..'

26:42.291 --> 26:44.542
...who's Turbo, Don?

26:44.625 --> 26:46.125
I don't know.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.166
I just wanted them to stop.

26:52.417 --> 26:54.375
I didn't think it
would go that far.

26:57.667 --> 26:59.333
When it's darkest,
men see stars.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.000
When it's darkest,
men see stars.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.333
Don't be scared, Turbo.

27:03.417 --> 27:05.792
This spot's gonna make
the angels weep.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.583
Whoo!

27:07.667 --> 27:11.000
I w-want to see
s-stars, Carlos.

27:11.083 --> 27:13.083
- You want stars?
- Yeah.

27:13.166 --> 27:14.583
You got stars.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.875
Let me see that first.

27:16.959 --> 27:19.083
(Carlos)
'"Emerson?"
Now who's that?'

27:20.959 --> 27:22.333
You said there
weren't any
stars.

27:22.417 --> 27:23.875
That's what you said. Remember?

27:23.959 --> 27:26.917
Did say that,
but I was wrong.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.417
Alright.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.125
- Check this out.
- Freeze, you maggots!

27:31.208 --> 27:34.250
Oh, somebody narced us out!
Come-come on!

27:34.333 --> 27:37.041
Let's go! Come on, killer.
Come on, let's go!

27:37.125 --> 27:39.250
'Come on let's
go come on!'

27:44.709 --> 27:46.125
Come on, Turbo!

27:46.875 --> 27:48.542
You can do it!

27:48.625 --> 27:50.417
(Don)
'Get you, you little
bastard!'

27:56.166 --> 27:57.750
- Help! Carlos!
- I got you, man.

27:57.834 --> 28:00.250
- Carlos! Help!
- I got you, man. I got you.

28:06.792 --> 28:09.750
Get out of here! I'll tell
them
it was just me.

28:09.834 --> 28:12.583
Go before the cops come!

28:12.667 --> 28:14.083
'Go!'

28:21.667 --> 28:23.625
Night..

28:23.709 --> 28:25.166
...changed my life.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.542
Can't fix what happened.

28:32.041 --> 28:34.083
But I've tried
to do some good.

28:37.291 --> 28:39.500
If Carlos was alive
today, I'm sure..

28:41.083 --> 28:43.166
...he'd be doing
exactly what I'm doing..

28:44.583 --> 28:46.542
...giving these
kids some hope.

28:50.834 --> 28:53.125
(Curtis)
'What the hell
was that, Kat?'

28:53.208 --> 28:54.417
I'm trying to help
you out here.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.000
I'm-I'm sorry.

28:56.083 --> 28:58.083
I-I couldn't take it.

28:58.166 --> 29:00.583
Well, that much I got.

29:00.667 --> 29:02.625
Look, if Jarrod
wants
to see Veronica..

29:03.917 --> 29:05.291
...he's gonna
have
to go to court.

29:05.375 --> 29:06.792
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna
have to warn you.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.000
His-his lawyer's
gonna present a guy

29:09.083 --> 29:11.125
who's been clean
for five years.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.875
I leave you alone at the
table,
and now you're defending him?

29:13.959 --> 29:17.417
I'm just saying how it's
gonna look in court.

29:17.500 --> 29:21.625
Look, judges try to give
parents
contact with their children.

29:24.542 --> 29:26.667
No, this is
different,
Curtis.

29:26.750 --> 29:29.834
He's an
ex-banger.
You're not.

29:31.125 --> 29:32.333
He's still her father.

29:32.417 --> 29:34.792
Not everyone deserves
a second chance.

29:39.792 --> 29:42.000
I'm sorry you feel that way.

29:42.083 --> 29:45.458
In my book, guy should be
able to see his own kid.

30:32.125 --> 30:33.333
Ma'am?

30:35.250 --> 30:37.000
- There a problem, lady?
- No.

30:37.083 --> 30:38.417
Got to move the car.

30:56.458 --> 30:59.917
Tracked the orange paint can
that Carlos was killed with.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.917
Manufacturer sold it
to Harold's Hardware.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.125
Store where Gina worked.

31:04.208 --> 31:05.917
(Eddie)
'Excuse me.'

31:06.000 --> 31:08.917
I'm Eddie Clark. Work at
the Fairhill Soup kitchen.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.417
Saw one of your posters.

31:10.500 --> 31:14.333
I know this boy, was there
when he painted this piece.

31:14.417 --> 31:16.250
Don't hardly do
it justice, though.

31:29.250 --> 31:32.500
(Eddie)
'Beautiful, ain't it?
Just like I told you.'

31:36.083 --> 31:38.500
'Spent a lot of time
down here back then.'

31:43.125 --> 31:44.250
Whoa!

31:45.959 --> 31:49.500
Man, whe-where did you
learn how to do that?

31:52.291 --> 31:53.792
(Carlos)
'The streets.'

31:53.875 --> 31:57.041
Must be some damn angels
on the street you come from

31:57.125 --> 31:59.500
'cause I ain't never
seen nothing like
that.

32:00.417 --> 32:02.417
Got us an
artist
in the sewer.

32:04.458 --> 32:05.875
Ain't an artist.

32:07.250 --> 32:08.834
You tell that to them.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.500
What you..

32:12.583 --> 32:13.959
...what you call it?

32:15.417 --> 32:17.875
"When it's darkest..

32:17.959 --> 32:19.458
"...men see stars."

32:20.959 --> 32:23.041
That's what my
friend always wanted.

32:23.125 --> 32:24.709
(Eddie)
'You got a gift, brother.'

32:26.041 --> 32:27.500
'A real gift.'

32:29.625 --> 32:31.583
You could do
something with that.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.500
What are they doing?

32:38.583 --> 32:40.792
Maybe they want
to see stars, too.

32:50.375 --> 32:54.375
Still come down from time to
time to look at those stars.

32:54.458 --> 32:56.834
Remind myself
how far I've come.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.834
You recognize those stars
from Gina's clothing line?

33:03.917 --> 33:08.041
Yeah. Our famous designer
said
she'd never seen this mural.

33:09.917 --> 33:12.750
"Dead on site. Talon."

33:12.834 --> 33:15.375
What kind of girlfriend
leaves a message like that?

33:19.792 --> 33:21.542
(Will)
'Recognize this, Gina?'

33:21.625 --> 33:23.333
So I capped his burner.

33:23.417 --> 33:24.458
Doesn't mean I hurt him.

33:24.542 --> 33:26.458
You want to read
that for us?

33:29.041 --> 33:30.917
"Dead on site."

33:31.000 --> 33:32.417
It was just an empty threat.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.125
- You two have an argument?
- Almost 30 years ago?

33:35.208 --> 33:37.208
You can't expect me
to remember ancient
history.

33:37.291 --> 33:38.583
You've been
pawning Carlos' stars

33:38.667 --> 33:40.291
off as your own
for nearly that long.

33:40.375 --> 33:43.250
He wasn't the type to care if
somebody was biting his work.

33:43.333 --> 33:45.250
(Will)
'Orange paint can
that killed Carlos'

33:45.333 --> 33:47.625
was sold at
Harold's Hardware.

33:47.709 --> 33:50.166
It's not like you think.

33:50.250 --> 33:51.625
I was all alone.

33:52.834 --> 33:54.625
I needed his help

33:54.709 --> 33:56.625
but he wouldn't do it.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.959
Carlos, there you are.

34:02.834 --> 34:04.542
Gina.

34:04.625 --> 34:05.792
I've been looking for you.

34:05.875 --> 34:08.458
A junkie jumped
me in the park.

34:08.542 --> 34:10.208
I needed someone
to watch my back.

34:10.291 --> 34:11.583
I couldn't find you.

34:20.375 --> 34:21.667
Leon died.

34:23.291 --> 34:24.667
He fell.

34:26.417 --> 34:28.000
It's my fault he was
up
there in the first
place.

34:32.250 --> 34:34.542
The streets aren't safe.

34:34.625 --> 34:37.125
That's why we need a crew.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.583
Look.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.458
It's the most I ever
racked from Harold.

34:42.542 --> 34:44.125
Now we've got something
to offer NRKE.

34:44.208 --> 34:46.166
What do you want
with those thugs?

34:46.250 --> 34:48.083
They've got a clubhouse..

34:48.166 --> 34:50.208
...a place to stay at night.

34:51.917 --> 34:54.333
Think they'll let
you in their crew?

34:54.417 --> 34:56.291
They will if you take me.

34:56.375 --> 34:58.834
Tut said you can join 'em.

34:58.917 --> 35:00.041
You don't-you don't get it.

35:00.125 --> 35:01.875
They're bombing
'cause they're punks.

35:04.959 --> 35:07.792
I'm done with that.
Alright.

35:07.875 --> 35:09.875
I don't care about
getting my name up.

35:11.709 --> 35:13.208
I wanna do something.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.500
Help people.

35:17.583 --> 35:18.750
In the sewer?

35:18.834 --> 35:20.458
Nobody's going to see
your work down here.

35:20.542 --> 35:22.166
They already have.

35:24.333 --> 35:26.667
Look, I want to do
something with this, Gina.

35:28.166 --> 35:29.417
You could, too--

35:29.500 --> 35:31.375
Bombers are getting
clipped left and
right.

35:31.458 --> 35:34.542
NRKE is the only crew whose
tags don't get taken down.

35:40.291 --> 35:42.542
You're right.

35:42.625 --> 35:44.667
Their tags never get buffed..

35:46.208 --> 35:47.417
...ever.

35:48.667 --> 35:51.375
Get away.

35:51.458 --> 35:52.750
- I got to go do something.
- No, no.

35:52.834 --> 35:55.792
- Just wait right here.
- Please don't leave me.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.375
I'll be back, I promise.

36:01.542 --> 36:02.875
He never came back.

36:04.375 --> 36:06.083
I was so mad

36:06.166 --> 36:07.792
I slashed his mural.

36:09.166 --> 36:11.917
I heard the next
day on the streets..

36:12.000 --> 36:13.875
...he'd been killed.

36:13.959 --> 36:16.000
You said he took your paint?

36:17.959 --> 36:19.959
Five cannons of my
signature orange.

36:21.125 --> 36:22.750
Know where he went?

36:23.875 --> 36:25.333
No.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.667
He was right, though.

36:27.750 --> 36:30.250
There's more to life
than just bombing.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.208
Question is where did
he go with that paint?

36:32.291 --> 36:34.917
Yeah, only the one can
found at the crime scene.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.041
Wasn't any graffiti
in that alley. Look.

36:39.125 --> 36:42.875
The wall behind Carlos's
body is completely bare.

36:42.959 --> 36:46.750
It seem odd to you a
whitewashed
wall in NRKE territory?

36:46.834 --> 36:48.792
Would have been hit
a hundred times.

36:48.875 --> 36:50.750
That wall's got
a story to tell.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.750
Let's peel back the layers.

37:10.291 --> 37:12.792
(Lilly)
'Your liquor store,
your gym'

37:12.875 --> 37:17.000
your El stop your
dear mother's church.

37:17.083 --> 37:19.166
Playing a game
<i>This Is Your</i>
<i>Life?</i>

37:19.250 --> 37:20.667
Cops must be bored.

37:20.750 --> 37:22.542
Sit up.

37:22.625 --> 37:24.333
Listen to the lady.

37:24.417 --> 37:26.959
Above your liquor store,
Turbo 102.

37:27.041 --> 37:29.750
On your gym marquee,
Turbo 102.

37:29.834 --> 37:32.709
On the church door,
Turbo 102.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.041
(Scotty)
'That your tag?'

37:34.125 --> 37:36.458
- Tut is my scribe.
- Yeah, in the '80s.

37:36.542 --> 37:38.792
Then the mayor cracked
down, you needed a new tag

37:38.875 --> 37:40.458
one nobody
could connect to you.

37:40.542 --> 37:42.500
That, that all
you got, huh?

37:42.583 --> 37:45.000
Random coincidence in my hood?

37:45.083 --> 37:47.291
Matched the paint
samples from Turbo 102

37:47.375 --> 37:49.000
with auto paint
in your body shop.

37:49.083 --> 37:52.166
It's expensive, but you
get it wholesale, right?

37:53.792 --> 37:56.083
You got me,
I'm-I'm Turbo
102.

37:59.041 --> 38:01.000
You stink like a rat.

38:01.083 --> 38:03.000
Who you calling a rat, man?
I'm the King.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.667
Yeah, King Snitch.

38:04.750 --> 38:07.542
Made anonymous calls about
Carlos and his friend Leon.

38:07.625 --> 38:10.792
I ain't no rat, man, lowest
life-form there is except..

38:10.875 --> 38:12.208
...for pigs.

38:15.834 --> 38:18.083
Got something else
you want to say, hmm?

38:18.166 --> 38:19.625
Come on in, Don.

38:21.834 --> 38:24.417
A snitch used to
call
him every day.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.709
Always the same voice.

38:25.792 --> 38:29.166
Now he loves to talk.
Go ahead, say something.

38:29.250 --> 38:31.375
Son of a bitch,
you're a dead man,
man!

38:31.458 --> 38:32.792
That's him.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.667
- Sit your ass down.
- That's police brutality,
man!

38:37.750 --> 38:39.875
No, brutality is what they do
to snitches in the badlands.

38:39.959 --> 38:42.417
Other bombers found out, you'd
have been a walking corpse.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.542
Carlos was about
to share your dirty secret

38:44.625 --> 38:47.417
with the whole neighborhood.
You had to shut him up.

38:47.500 --> 38:48.750
Look, I tried to
give
that fool an out.

38:48.834 --> 38:50.083
But he wouldn't take it.

38:50.166 --> 38:51.542
Little punk thought
he was better than
me!

38:51.625 --> 38:52.750
Yeah, thought he
could ruin your rep.

38:52.834 --> 38:54.333
Spent years getting
up building my name.

38:54.417 --> 38:56.250
They said a name was the only
thing you had in this world.

38:56.333 --> 38:58.041
Reason I took his.

38:58.125 --> 39:00.041
Bitch thought he
could get me
killed

39:00.125 --> 39:01.917
thought he could be King.

39:04.834 --> 39:06.542
There's only one King.

39:10.625 --> 39:12.125
What the hell you doing?

39:13.166 --> 39:15.083
Been waiting
for you to get
here.

39:15.166 --> 39:18.000
Yeah, my boys been telling me
you been putting up lies.

39:18.083 --> 39:19.125
I'm here to take 'em down.

39:19.208 --> 39:20.417
Your boys combing
the streets

39:20.500 --> 39:22.083
so you can rat
us taggers out?

39:23.542 --> 39:25.417
"Turbo 102."

39:25.500 --> 39:27.166
That's your new name?

39:27.250 --> 39:28.583
I kind of like it.

39:28.667 --> 39:31.250
That's my boy you got
killed with your snitching.

39:31.333 --> 39:32.667
"Turbo 102."

39:33.583 --> 39:35.458
It's my tag now, bitch.

39:36.959 --> 39:38.709
Don't even touch it.

39:38.792 --> 39:40.458
Leave it alone, man.

39:40.542 --> 39:42.834
Said I'm gonna take it down.
That's what I'm gonna do.

39:42.917 --> 39:46.667
I'll take it down myself if
you lay off other bombers.

39:46.750 --> 39:48.083
You giving me orders?

39:49.041 --> 39:50.625
I'm the King!

39:50.709 --> 39:52.291
It ain't about staying up.

39:53.542 --> 39:56.792
We can do more, change
things around here..

39:56.875 --> 39:58.583
Everyone dying
on the streets.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.208
You high or something?

40:02.166 --> 40:03.667
I said take it down.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.792
What's the life
expectancy
for a snitch?

40:11.166 --> 40:12.291
Take it down.

40:12.375 --> 40:14.625
You might as
well
not even exist.

40:14.709 --> 40:16.500
Take... it... down!

40:17.917 --> 40:19.625
Guess that's the only way
you're going to stay King

40:19.709 --> 40:21.959
'cause it sure as hell ain't
your skills doing the trick.

40:27.083 --> 40:28.500
Huh? Huh?
