Previously on Scorpion...
♪ ...Meu amigo amigvel. ♪

00:03.671 --> 00:06.507
I found a mathematical formula
for their dance tracks,

00:06.540 --> 00:09.777
and a few weeks later,
I had royalties coming in.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.480
If I uncuff him
without a direct order,

00:12.513 --> 00:15.816
I violate a half a dozen
federal statutes.

00:15.849 --> 00:16.650
Collins!

00:16.684 --> 00:18.319
(laughs)

00:18.352 --> 00:21.722
Agent Gallo, you're under arrest
for instigating an escape.

00:21.755 --> 00:22.390
I want a lawyer.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.824
I want to be your attorney.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.060
You want to what?
I can do this.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.329
I want a family.
I've always wanted a family.

00:28.362 --> 00:32.233
And I want one with you,
'cause I love you.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.168
Shall we start now?

00:34.202 --> 00:35.803
(phone chimes)

00:47.748 --> 00:50.818
WOMAN:
You may proceed, Counselor.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.688
Counselor?

00:54.722 --> 00:56.857
(whispering):
You're up.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.559
Oh. She means me.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.861
Right, I am a "counselor" now.
Okay.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.496
(sighs)

01:02.530 --> 01:04.532
Your Honor...

01:04.565 --> 01:06.734
or would you prefer "Judge"?

01:06.767 --> 01:08.302
'Cause "Your Honor"--

01:08.336 --> 01:10.338
it-it just sounds so formal.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.608
But we-we are...
in a, uh, formal setting.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.244
Either will do.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.412
Okay, then.
"Your Honor" it is.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.514
I move for
an immediate dismissal

01:20.548 --> 01:22.350
of all the charges
against my client,

01:22.383 --> 01:24.618
Cabe Gallo, who is
accused of abetting

01:24.652 --> 01:28.889
the escape of federal inmate
Mark Collins, on the grounds

01:28.922 --> 01:31.692
that if my client had
acted in any other manner,

01:31.725 --> 01:33.894
it would have been
in direct violation

01:33.927 --> 01:37.165
of Mr. Collins'
constitutional rights.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.699
Thank you.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.403
This is the part
of the proceedings

01:42.436 --> 01:43.771
where you elaborate,
Counselor.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.239
SYLVESTER:
Right.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.640
(laughs)
Of course.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.676
(clears throat)

01:49.943 --> 01:54.282
The Eighth Amendment forbids
cruel and unusual punishment.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.750
Yes, they taught us that
in law school.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.519
How does it pertain
to this case?

01:58.552 --> 01:59.787
Well, Honor...

01:59.820 --> 02:02.223
I mean, Your Judge... ship...

02:05.459 --> 02:07.295
This brief... Oh.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.929
(rifling through papers)

02:08.962 --> 02:10.731
This brief.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.567
Uh, it describes the
incident in question.

02:13.601 --> 02:17.305
If Agent Gallo had r-run off
without...

02:17.338 --> 02:19.240
Uh...
Uncuffing.

02:19.273 --> 02:22.543
Right. Uncuffing the stun cuff

02:22.576 --> 02:24.945
from Mark Collins' fo, um...

02:24.978 --> 02:26.714
His ankle.

02:26.747 --> 02:27.781
(laughing):
Yes.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.951
His ankle, then the prisoner
would have essentially

02:30.984 --> 02:32.953
been tortured by electrocution,

02:32.986 --> 02:36.690
which is in clear violation
of his Eighth Amendment rights.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.659
Okay.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.861
I follow your logic.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.663
And it is a good argument,

02:42.696 --> 02:45.466
especially for someone
who is clearly new at this.

02:45.499 --> 02:49.537
(laughs) But whether your client
was protecting Mr. Collins' rights

02:49.570 --> 02:52.840
or helping him escape is
a matter for a jury to decide,

02:52.873 --> 02:54.508
not me.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.945
This case will proceed to trial.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.982
The second I got in
front of that judge,

03:02.015 --> 03:03.917
my brain turned
to Jell-O.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.419
I have an eidetic memory.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.388
I can remember
the ingredients

03:07.421 --> 03:09.890
from a cereal box
from when I was eight,

03:09.923 --> 03:11.592
but in there, I forgot
the word "ankle."

03:11.625 --> 03:13.261
You can handle pressure.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.928
I've seen you save
the world with math

03:14.962 --> 03:16.830
that would make Einstein
cry uncle.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.567
Math? Math isn't a
persuasive argument.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.469
You'll do
better next time.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.937
What's important is
today's your birthday.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.973
The big two-five.
Let's celebrate.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.342
I'll call the gang,
let 'em know what happened

03:28.376 --> 03:30.244
so when we get there,
we can focus

03:30.278 --> 03:32.913
on what's really important:
Sly's Big Day.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.948
Okay. Thanks, Cabe.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.358
(tuning guitar)

03:44.392 --> 03:46.427
HAPPY:
What's up, boss?

03:46.460 --> 03:48.028
You wanted to see me?
Yes.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.031
I need your expert opinion.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.866
My expert opinion is that,

03:52.900 --> 03:54.568
whatever you're doing
with the guitar,

03:54.602 --> 03:56.270
you should not record
on that fossil.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.871
Well, analog provides

03:57.905 --> 04:00.007
better signal-to-noise ratio.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.975
I am making a song
for Paige.

04:02.009 --> 04:05.546
Okay, what did you do wrong
that now you have to do this?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.481
I, uh...
I failed miserably

04:07.515 --> 04:09.049
at a live-music date
a few weeks ago,

04:09.082 --> 04:11.752
so I am making it up to her

04:11.785 --> 04:13.487
by writing a love ballad.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.889
And I figured since you had
a hit song in Portugal,

04:15.923 --> 04:18.759
that I would like for you
to evaluate my progress.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.394
Yeah, that song
was garbage.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.995
I just used math.
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.632
I created an algorithm
to analyze

04:24.665 --> 04:27.067
every major love song over
the past 75 years,

04:27.100 --> 04:29.770
and then I put together
an optimal combination

04:29.803 --> 04:32.039
of the most popular words.

04:32.072 --> 04:32.806
Oh, boy.
Yep.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.908
So, from the '50s
to the '70s,

04:34.942 --> 04:38.078
the most commonly used word
was "love".

04:38.111 --> 04:40.047
And then, oddly,
the emphasis shifted

04:40.080 --> 04:42.516
to "baby" in the '80s.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.318
And then songwriters
became infatuated

04:44.352 --> 04:46.019
with the word "booty,"

04:46.053 --> 04:49.790
which is slang for buttocks.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.892
Just play the song.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.627
Okay.

04:53.661 --> 04:57.531
♪ Your love is love is love,
baby ♪

04:57.565 --> 05:01.034
♪ You know your love
is love is love ♪

05:01.068 --> 05:03.937
♪ 'Cause I love you

05:03.971 --> 05:06.540
♪ And you love me

05:06.574 --> 05:08.442
♪ You've got a lovely

05:08.476 --> 05:10.711
♪ Booty

05:10.744 --> 05:12.346
♪ You let...
What's wrong?

05:12.380 --> 05:14.548
Uh, all of it.
But most importantly,

05:14.582 --> 05:16.484
your song has no soul.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.520
I did exactly what you did,
and you got a hit.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.622
I rolled for the lowest
common denominator.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.057
You're trying to appeal
to a specific person,

05:24.091 --> 05:26.827
who might not be a genius,
but whose EQ is off the charts.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.996
You're not gonna fool her
with the cookie-cutter crap.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.731
You want to make
the waitress swoon?

05:30.764 --> 05:34.334
Okay, can the math,
look into your heart.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.071
Also, don't mention
her booty.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.106
(door opens)

05:43.744 --> 05:46.380
Motion to dismiss
got dismissed?

05:46.414 --> 05:48.582
My client has encouraged me
to focus on my birthday,

05:48.616 --> 05:50.718
so I will not
discuss the case.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.720
You want to talk about it?

05:52.753 --> 05:54.922
You ever hear
of the yips?

05:54.955 --> 05:56.089
What, like when
a second baseman

05:56.123 --> 05:57.124
suddenly can't toss
the ball to first?

05:57.157 --> 05:59.593
Yeah. I think Sly's got 'em.
Wow.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.795
Sylvester's first
sports disorder.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.130
Figured it would be jock itch.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.866
I think he's in his head
about talking in court.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.970
I mean, I want to
believe in the kid, but...

06:10.003 --> 06:12.606
if he craps out, I'm dead.

06:12.640 --> 06:16.544
He's not taking it too well.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.447
At least his birthday
ought to cheer him up.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.981
Speaking of birthdays,

06:21.014 --> 06:22.616
how go the efforts
of putting a bun

06:22.650 --> 06:24.117
in Happy's oven?

06:24.151 --> 06:26.053
I'm not discussing
Happy's oven with you.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.588
You know, the other day
I was in the doctor's office,

06:27.621 --> 06:29.156
and I picked up one of
those women's magazines.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.525
There was an article that said
a lady has a better chance

06:31.559 --> 06:33.761
of conceiving if,
by the end, you know,

06:33.794 --> 06:37.531
she's... she's gotten
sprinkles on her cupcake.

06:42.570 --> 06:43.871
Are you making sure

06:43.904 --> 06:47.508
that Happy's getting sprinkles
on her cupcake, son?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.076
What?

06:49.109 --> 06:50.611
You know about sprinkles?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.079
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know about sprinkles.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.015
Happy's got more sprinkles
than the ice cream man.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.150
All right. 'Cause if
you need any tips

06:57.184 --> 06:58.452
in the gooty department...

06:58.486 --> 06:59.520
I don't need any tips.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.122
And please don't ruin
gooty for me.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.691
I'm just trying to help.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.593
Hey, guys, what's up?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.761
Nothing.
Nothing that concerns you.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.563
Um, okay.
Well, is everybody ready?

07:09.597 --> 07:10.898
We've got a long drive
to the festival grounds

07:10.931 --> 07:13.233
for Sylvester's big
birthday outing.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.469
You're telling me.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.704
When I worked for the FBI,
I used to have to schlep stuff

07:16.737 --> 07:19.507
out to the evidence warehouse,
not far from where we're going.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.908
It is in the middle
of nowhere.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.843
Mm, centrally located.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.045
That's the only way they could
get the nerds out to Nerdfest

07:25.078 --> 07:26.079
to pull a profit.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.749
Oh, costumes.
Toby. Uh...

07:28.782 --> 07:31.184
Happy.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.555
Not good.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.689
What's not good?

07:35.723 --> 07:38.726
We, sir,
are headed to celebrate

07:38.759 --> 07:41.529
my day of birth
at the Los Angeles

07:41.562 --> 07:43.764
Renaissance Festival.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.633
It's today, damn it.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.001
Oh, yes.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.170
And we will get in
ahead of the masses

07:50.203 --> 07:54.608
with these--
our VIP passes.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.644
So don your garb,

07:56.677 --> 07:59.880
for today, we're gonna party
like it's 1599.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.485
♪

08:24.171 --> 08:25.172
(record scratches)

08:25.205 --> 08:26.607
How long we been walking?

08:26.640 --> 08:28.876
Feels like forever.
This is ridiculous.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.711
Why'd they put the parking lot
so far away?

08:30.744 --> 08:32.713
"No cars allowed
on the site."

08:32.746 --> 08:36.149
This festival aims
for total authenticity.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.651
Really? They had
electrical transformers

08:37.685 --> 08:39.019
in the 1600s?
SYLVESTER: Oh, man,

08:39.052 --> 08:40.053
that isn't supposed
to be thee.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.756
The county runs utility
lines through this area.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.157
Land's not good for much,
that's why they put

08:44.191 --> 08:46.026
government warehouses
out here.

08:46.059 --> 08:50.564
Let us not talk of such
crass matters as commerce.

08:50.598 --> 08:53.333
It is time
to celebrate.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.704
Let the revels commence!

09:08.348 --> 09:10.718
Come on, birthday boy.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.789
The men here are
all pretending to be

09:15.823 --> 09:17.858
knights and warriors,
while the women are pretending

09:17.891 --> 09:19.059
to wash their clothes.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.628
Even the fake past sucks.

09:20.661 --> 09:21.662
Oh, it couldn't have
been all bad.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.663
What about the age
of chivalry?

09:22.696 --> 09:25.733
Make way, wench.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.034
Seriously?
Would you...

09:27.067 --> 09:29.036
All right, look... Hey,
hey, there's a blacksmith.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.939
You like that kind
of thing. Come on.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.141
Look at that.
The simplicity

09:34.174 --> 09:35.676
of this time period
is so amazing.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.376
Yeah, well, you know,
if they really wanted

09:36.409 --> 09:37.811
to make this place authentic,

09:37.845 --> 09:39.680
they would throw raw sewage
out in the street,

09:39.713 --> 09:41.114
and give a few of
these people the plague.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.851
They have authentic food.
They have big turkey legs

09:43.884 --> 09:45.886
and roasted ears of corn.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.055
Cheesy fries.
Well...

09:48.088 --> 09:49.289
they could have had
cheesy French fries.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.290
They had cheese,
they had potatoes,

09:50.323 --> 09:51.091
they had France.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.126
Actually,
the potato was brought

09:53.160 --> 09:55.696
from Peru to Spain
by conquistadors.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.998
This place is about fun.
It's not a history lesson.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.700
Actually, this place
needs a history lesson,

09:59.733 --> 10:02.002
starting with us-- it is silly
for you to be dressed

10:02.035 --> 10:03.370
as Maid Marian
and me as Robin Hood

10:03.403 --> 10:04.838
because not not only
were Robin and Marian

10:04.872 --> 10:07.140
not figures of the Renaissance

10:07.174 --> 10:09.076
but rather of the late
medieval period,

10:09.109 --> 10:12.079
also, they were probably
not even real people at all.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.080
(trumpet fanfare)

10:13.113 --> 10:15.215
MAN:
Make way for the king.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.885
WOMAN: My Lord.
MAN: Your Highness.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.319
(horse neighing)

10:19.352 --> 10:21.755
Clearly milady has chosen

10:21.789 --> 10:23.691
to grace our fine
English Festival dressed

10:23.724 --> 10:24.725
as a hero of yesteryear.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.995
I, King Phillip,
hereby declare

10:28.028 --> 10:29.663
her costume lacks
but one thing--

10:29.697 --> 10:31.264
a rose.
(Paige gasps)

10:31.298 --> 10:32.833
Which, alas, pales

10:32.866 --> 10:34.768
beside such beauty
as your own.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.137
Why, thank you, my liege.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.673
Please, (chuckles)
call me king.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.709
Actually, King Phillip
was Spanish,

10:41.742 --> 10:44.444
and an enemy of England
during the Renaissance.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.680
Therefore, would most
certainly not be presiding

10:46.714 --> 10:47.948
over an English festival.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.449
Enough. What is your problem?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.384
The past is,
by definition, past.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.687
Pretending to be
in it is silly.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.789
Whatever. I'm going
to enjoy the festival

10:55.823 --> 10:57.791
on my own.

10:57.825 --> 11:00.127
Good morrow, my king.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.030
Mmm. Milady.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.197
(sighs)

11:04.231 --> 11:07.167
A fool thinks himself
to be a wise man,

11:07.200 --> 11:10.070
but a wise man knows himself
to be a fool.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.740
(horse neighs)

11:12.773 --> 11:14.141
King coming through!

11:14.174 --> 11:16.710
HAPPY:
That is a caltrop.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.879
Medieval anti-cavalry device.

11:18.912 --> 11:22.315
It's like road strips cops use
to stop cars, but for horses.

11:22.349 --> 11:26.086
It's horrible, but this guy's
technique is excellent.

11:27.821 --> 11:28.789
Hey, she's taken.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.490
He isn't flirting.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.759
I'm dressed like an idiot.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.794
Yeah, but you look amazing.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.863
Really?
This outfit, too?

11:35.896 --> 11:37.130
I'm an executioner.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.899
What a way to go.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.333
Okay.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.002
Meet me at the hayloft

11:42.035 --> 11:43.470
at Ye Old Livery Stable
in five minutes.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.338
I want to see
this guy finish.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.141
As you wish.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.844
You, me lady, shall
experience pleasures

11:50.878 --> 11:53.146
the likes of
which no man...

11:53.180 --> 11:54.848
Don't ruin it.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.216
Copy that.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.755
Thank you.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.924
Oh, Toby, can I talk
to you for a moment?

12:03.957 --> 12:05.425
Yeah, you couldn't have
picked a worse time. No.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.094
It's driving me nuts that
Walter can't just relax

12:07.127 --> 12:09.262
and enjoy this place, and if
not for Sly, then for me.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.298
Yeah, well, Walter's Walter. I got to go.
No, please, Toby.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.266
It's like, it's
like every week

12:13.300 --> 12:15.235
I'm giving him
boyfriend lessons.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.838
I-I knew it would be
hard, but this hard?

12:17.871 --> 12:20.040
(scoffs)
You and Happy

12:20.073 --> 12:23.010
had problems but at your cores
you're alike.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.244
And... (sighs)
I don't know,

12:24.277 --> 12:26.914
we're just-- we're such
different people.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.416
Yeah. Well, um,

12:29.449 --> 12:31.351
you know,
Happy and I are, uh,

12:31.384 --> 12:32.986
we're like, uh,
double chocolate,

12:33.020 --> 12:34.287
which-which is an
amazing flavor,

12:34.321 --> 12:36.857
but, um, so is chocolate
and peanut butter.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.426
You just got to give it
some time. Y-You know,

12:39.459 --> 12:41.428
it took Happy and me a long time
to be on the same page.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.230
Look at us now.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.065
We're gonna
get it on in a hayloft.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.266
Ooh, I'm happy to hear
the effort

12:46.299 --> 12:48.368
to bring us a Scorpion baby
continues apace.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.470
Pardon the interruption,
kind sir,

12:50.503 --> 12:52.505
but if a child
is thine heart's desire,

12:52.539 --> 12:55.208
what wouldest thou say

12:55.242 --> 12:57.010
to this magical
pregnancy amulet?

12:57.044 --> 12:58.311
Anne Boleyn was wearing one

12:58.345 --> 13:00.881
when she conceived
Queen Elizabeth.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.016
Oh, yes, what wouldest
thou say?

13:03.050 --> 13:05.318
I'd say that story
and thine amulet

13:05.352 --> 13:07.320
are pure skimble-skamble.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.023
Huh.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.292
Hey, look, Sly.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.527
It's your nerd buddies
from the Warlock's Chest.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.464
Yeah, they play
Renaissance Festivals

13:17.497 --> 13:19.599
as the "Lord of the Sings."

13:19.632 --> 13:22.302
(gasps)
They got Nightingale.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.404
He's a gamer.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.373
He usually frolics in Riverside,
but sometimes he jams with them

13:26.406 --> 13:27.975
because he's got
the voice of a...

13:28.008 --> 13:29.309
A meadowlark?

13:29.342 --> 13:30.543
No, of a nightingale.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.247
A hale and hearty
Happy Birthday to thee,

13:34.281 --> 13:35.615
Sylvester the Conquestor.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.050
SYLVESTER:
Ah, dear Kaldor,

13:37.084 --> 13:38.485
today, I am disguised

13:38.518 --> 13:41.855
as astronomer Galileo Galilei.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.224
And hail to thee as well,
Magnus Gallo.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.392
"Magnus"?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.260
Don't ask.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.462
Kaldor. Others.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.365
Sweet Lord Rayne costume,
Magnus.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.466
Are you a Bladie, too?

13:53.500 --> 13:54.367
Come again?

13:54.401 --> 13:55.568
Chair of Blades.

13:55.602 --> 13:56.937
You're dressed
as one of the characters

13:56.970 --> 13:59.372
from Chair of Blades.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.507
It's one of the most popular
TV shows out there.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.408
It's about a group of warriors

14:01.441 --> 14:03.376
who vie for the right

14:03.410 --> 14:05.913
to sit upon a chair of blades.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.147
That sounds uncomfortable.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.281
Sounds stupid.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.416
NIGHTINGALE:
Okay, guys.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.451
Let us jam.

Thank you. All right.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.349
Yeah. Come on,
let him play.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.717
Come on, Sly.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.419
(trumpet blows)

15:19.452 --> 15:21.254
Royalty passing through.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.555
Oh.
Zounds.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.623
It is King Phillip.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.292
KING PHILLIP:
Yes.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.560
Oh, stop it.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.062
Keep going.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.435
Arise, peasant.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.470
And behold.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.546
(shouts)

15:46.579 --> 15:49.449
'Tis nothing
for the one true king!

15:49.482 --> 15:51.484
(cheering, applause)

15:51.518 --> 15:53.320
ALL:
Huzzah!

15:53.353 --> 15:55.488
What says thou?
Huzzah!

15:55.522 --> 15:57.590
Huzzah!
Huzzah!

15:59.359 --> 16:00.327
Hmm.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.431
Wouldest thou care
for a try, Robin of the Hood?

16:04.464 --> 16:05.632
Oh, I'm happy to.
Mm.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.000
Just give me the remote.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.269
(laughing):
What meanest thou?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.271
I meanest the device
in your left hand

16:11.304 --> 16:13.473
that kills the electromagnet
holding the sword.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.475
That's the
biggest sham over here.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.610
So your stores
have credit cards,

16:17.644 --> 16:19.046
the band has microphones,

16:19.079 --> 16:20.580
and you have an electromagnet.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.749
There was no electricity
in the Renaissance.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.284
(man grunting)

16:25.618 --> 16:26.753
(electricity sparking)
(people exclaiming)

16:26.786 --> 16:28.655
(horse neighing)
What happened?

16:28.688 --> 16:30.557
WALTER: Oh, the transformer
that didn't exist

16:30.590 --> 16:32.559
during the Renaissance
just blew up.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.394
Well, I guess
we should just go home.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.528
It's Sly's birthday.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.729
Fix it.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.768
What happened? Overheating?

16:41.801 --> 16:44.104
TOBY: No. I didn't
get a chance to.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.173
The electricity went out,
and we had to stop, and...

16:46.206 --> 16:47.674
Oh. Oh, the transformer.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.509
That wasn't an overload.
It was sabotage.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.611
Piece of metal was jammed
into the works.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.147
Blew the substation.
Power must be out for miles.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.316
Who'd sabotage a
Renaissance Festival?

16:56.349 --> 16:59.252
Probably someone with a sense
of historical accuracy.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.153
Shut up, listen.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.121
(motorcycle engine revving)

17:01.154 --> 17:03.223
Sly, give me your telescope.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.400
What are you looking at?

17:13.433 --> 17:14.634
Biker down there,

17:14.667 --> 17:16.803
wearing the same
stupid clothes as us.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.338
You think he disguised himself
so he could come here

17:18.371 --> 17:19.572
and blow the transformer?

17:19.606 --> 17:21.608
And kill power to the security
at the LAPD evidence warehouse.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.281
Oh, man.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.283
They're gonna rob the place.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.319
♪

17:39.492 --> 17:41.494
(birds chirping)

17:45.498 --> 17:48.768
Yep. They are definitely
robbing the evidence warehouse.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.170
Bandits?

17:50.203 --> 17:51.504
Are you certain?

17:51.538 --> 17:52.739
I'm calling 911.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.842
WALTER: Yeah, one of the bikers
is dressed in Festival garb.

17:55.875 --> 17:59.212
I'm guessing Medieval Knievel
disguised himself

17:59.246 --> 18:01.314
so he could stroll right in here
without being noticed.

18:01.348 --> 18:04.184
And destroy the substation
transformer,

18:04.217 --> 18:06.319
knocking out the alarms, doors
and electric fence

18:06.353 --> 18:07.387
at the evidence warehouse.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.355
My cell's dead.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.589
Mine, too.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.523
Oh, when that transformer blew,

18:10.557 --> 18:12.259
it must have sent
an electromagnetic pulse

18:12.292 --> 18:13.226
through the festival grounds.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.861
Computer chips are toast.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.130
Surge must've fried the nearest
cell phone tower, too.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.898
Well, it might as well
really be in the 16th century.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.368
Is there a landline
at the office?

18:21.401 --> 18:23.536
What meanest thou
by "landline"?

18:23.570 --> 18:24.737
Oh, dude, seriously?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.340
Verily. There is a "landline."

18:27.374 --> 18:30.543
But, alas, the phone
is without cord.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.479
A cordless phone. That
means we can't dial out

18:32.512 --> 18:34.314
until we restore power.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.748
Can we restore power?

18:35.782 --> 18:38.318
Well, with the crap around here
to work with? Unknown.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.320
When they destroyed the
substation, it must have cut off

18:40.353 --> 18:41.754
electricity to homes,

18:41.788 --> 18:44.391
hospitals, uh, businesses,
traffic lights.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.258
It's rush hour soon.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.226
It's gonna be Carmageddon
out there.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.261
So you're saying
things are gonna get worse?

18:48.295 --> 18:49.529
(gunshots in distance)

18:51.764 --> 18:53.766
CABE:
Things already got worse.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.870
They shot the guard.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.239
He's not moving.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.445
Oh, that doesn't look good.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.447
Oh, hang on. That man's alive.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.349
All right. Walter and
Toby, you're with me.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.518
Paige, see if this place
has ye olde first aid kit.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.353
We're gonna need it when we get back.
On it.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.821
Okay. Sly, Happy,
go fix the electricity,

19:14.854 --> 19:16.189
see if we can call for help.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.190
Copy that.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.658
How are you gonna get
all the way down there?

19:18.691 --> 19:19.792
CABE:
We can't drive,

19:19.826 --> 19:21.528
'cause we parked a mile away.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.629
CABE:
King.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.231
Go back to the festival,

19:24.264 --> 19:25.565
tell everybody
to get the hell out of here.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.568
You're gonna have
to do it on foot,

19:28.601 --> 19:31.371
because I'm gonna
commandeer your horse.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.812
Don't worry, buddy.
We're gonna help you.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.382
(clattering)

19:49.456 --> 19:53.226
Bikers are ripping that place
apart looking for something.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.328
The evidence manifest
is computerized,

19:55.362 --> 19:56.429
so they can't
check it.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.665
It's gonna take them a while
to find what they want.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.401
Hey, are there
any other cops in there?

20:01.434 --> 20:02.935
(breathlessly):
No.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.240
Okay. You two,
get him to the cart.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.375
I'll make sure
they can't follow us.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.243
Okay. Go, go, go, go. Go.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.383
(exhales)

20:17.484 --> 20:19.452
Okay.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.920
(grunts)

20:20.953 --> 20:22.755
Defibrillator. (gasps)
First aid kit.

20:22.789 --> 20:23.790
What's the verdict?

20:23.823 --> 20:24.824
It's a melted mess in there,

20:24.857 --> 20:26.025
but if we can make a new coil,

20:26.058 --> 20:27.594
I think I can get this thing
running again.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.295
How do we do that?

20:28.328 --> 20:29.962
We have to create a ferromagnet.

20:29.996 --> 20:30.763
In English.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.632
We need iron bars
and copper wire.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.000
Oh, the jewelry booth
uses copper wire.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.668
And the blacksmith
has plenty of iron.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.904
Sly, give me a hand. Let's go.

20:37.937 --> 20:41.908
Okay, uh, you put on some gloves
and I'll get you some tongs.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.646
HAPPY:
Okay, Thor, hammer away.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.482
(shouts)

20:51.618 --> 20:53.386
(quietly):
Why didn't he slash the tires?

20:53.420 --> 20:56.656
They're Kevlar. You can't pop
them with a set of keys.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.425
Can't be married to Happy Quinn
without learning

20:58.458 --> 20:59.926
a thing or two
about motorcycles.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.999
(grunts)

21:08.335 --> 21:09.802
(quietly):
Let's go.

21:09.836 --> 21:10.903
Hyah!
(horse neighs)

21:12.839 --> 21:15.041
(hissing)

21:16.008 --> 21:18.611
Uh, this'll do. Let's go.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.882
Hey. I got the wire.
Okay, we've got

21:22.915 --> 21:25.418
to step the current down
from 110K to 9K volts.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.986
That means wrapping
the short ends

21:27.019 --> 21:28.087
of this iron rectangle
with copper.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.823
Has to have the right ratio
of turns. Sly, compute.

21:30.857 --> 21:31.991
Right. Faraday's law.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.693
Okay, primary coil needs
eleven hundred...

21:33.726 --> 21:35.495
Okay, just do it.
I've got other work.

21:35.528 --> 21:38.631
(horse neighs)

21:38.665 --> 21:40.667
(horse snorts)

21:41.901 --> 21:43.035
(horse neighs)

21:43.069 --> 21:44.337
Whoa.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.972
All right,
this guy's in bad shape!

21:46.005 --> 21:47.006
We got to hurry!

21:48.808 --> 21:50.810
Uh, heartbeat's irregular.
I got to get that bullet out.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.845
Uh, I need tweezers,
forceps, something.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.046
Will jewelry pliers work?

21:54.080 --> 21:56.416
That's perfect.
Uh, now I need to sterilize.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.918
Is there alcohol? There's
none in the first aid kid.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.720
How 'bout the finest rum?

22:00.753 --> 22:01.454
That'll do!

22:01.488 --> 22:02.755
CABE: Okay,
everyone, your help

22:02.789 --> 22:03.856
is appreciated,

22:03.890 --> 22:05.525
but we're dealing
with dangerous men.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.093
And Phil here
should've already

22:07.126 --> 22:08.628
told you to go home.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.062
We can't.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.399
With the traffic lights out
and half of L.A. blacked out,

22:12.432 --> 22:15.101
the-the service roads to the
freeway are backed up forever!

22:15.134 --> 22:16.903
Sorry, pal,

22:16.936 --> 22:19.739
I know this doesn't tickle.
(grunts)

22:19.772 --> 22:23.042
(shouting)
(groaning)

22:23.075 --> 22:25.545
Walt, pour some of that
grog on the wound. Yeah.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.046
This is gonna sting-eth.
(groaning)

22:27.079 --> 22:29.949
This is great.
I'm gonna throw up.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.585
(panting)

22:35.955 --> 22:37.590
You look funny.

22:37.624 --> 22:40.460
Verily. How you feeling?!

22:40.493 --> 22:41.961
Like I got shot.

22:41.994 --> 22:42.929
(pants)

22:42.962 --> 22:44.997
And woke up
in a Medieval Times restaurant.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.600
Well, you ain't too far
from wrong.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.469
Any idea what those
guys were after?

22:49.502 --> 22:51.671
This.
(grunts)

22:51.704 --> 22:54.807
Leader of the biker gang
killed a cop up in Sacramento.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.509
This had the cop's blood on it.

22:56.543 --> 22:57.477
And his.

22:57.510 --> 22:58.811
Heard about that shooting.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.480
Lawyer got a
change of venue,

23:00.513 --> 23:01.981
so the trial's
gonna happen here.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.750
Someone must've tipped
the gang

23:03.783 --> 23:05.418
to where the evidence was.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.520
Knew what they were after,
so I grabbed it.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.989
If they destroy that evidence,
a cop killer walks.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.124
Listen, promise,
no matter what happens to me,

23:12.158 --> 23:13.826
you won't let them have this.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.061
Hey, we promise.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.530
(groaning)

23:17.564 --> 23:19.499
(grunts, pants)
Okay, hey,

23:19.532 --> 23:20.700
tell me what you're feeling!

23:20.733 --> 23:23.670
(strained):
Pressure inside my chest.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.137
Oh, Toby, he's turning gray.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.006
Bullet must've nicked
the pericardial sac

23:27.039 --> 23:28.140
around his heart. The bullet
was probably blocking the hole.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.543
And when I took it out,
it started filling with blood

23:30.577 --> 23:32.078
and putting pressure
on his heart.

23:32.111 --> 23:35.715
So, uh, I need
a red-hot poker

23:35.748 --> 23:37.149
to cauterize
the wound,

23:37.183 --> 23:38.184
stop the bleeding
or he's gonna die.

23:38.217 --> 23:39.919
Blacksmith's. On it.

23:39.952 --> 23:40.853
CABE:
When those bikers

23:40.887 --> 23:42.689
realize the evidence
they're looking for

23:42.722 --> 23:45.091
isn't in that warehouse
and who took it...

23:45.124 --> 23:46.859
(gulps)

23:46.893 --> 23:49.529
I'm gonna go stand guard.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.864
King, you're with me.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.601
Let's go, Phil-boy,
move your knickers.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.469
Hey, man. My name's Chad.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.938
I sell Jacuzzis in the Valley.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.707
I don't fight bikers.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.076
I'm out of here.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.012
Son of a blunderbuss.

24:06.045 --> 24:09.048
He's abandoned us.
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

24:09.081 --> 24:10.049
Poker.
Okay.

24:10.082 --> 24:13.019
Here comes Renaissance
trauma care at its finest.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.721
Walt, Paige,
I hate to ask.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.157
Hey, man,

24:18.190 --> 24:19.559
I'll see you when you wake up,

24:19.592 --> 24:20.827
okay?

24:20.860 --> 24:23.663
I'm really sorry about this.

24:23.696 --> 24:26.533
(screaming)

24:30.870 --> 24:33.973
All right.
He's passed out cold, but...

24:34.006 --> 24:37.209
the bleeding stopped!
He should be fine.

24:37.243 --> 24:38.745
Unless he isn't.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.547
He's going into cardiac arrest.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.781
You were supposed to fix
his heart!

24:41.814 --> 24:43.249
All right, if we want
to keep him alive,

24:43.282 --> 24:45.184
we got to find a way
to shock his pumper!

24:45.217 --> 24:47.887
Uh, there's a defibrillator back
by the, um, transformer.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.557
No, the battery'll be fried from the
transformer's electromagnetic shock.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.725
Well, if the capacitor blew,
the computer components

24:52.759 --> 24:54.927
were preserved.
I can build a new capacitor.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.228
Still won't work
without batteries.

24:56.262 --> 24:58.097
Great. We're stuck
in the 17th century,

24:58.130 --> 25:01.267
and the only thing we need
to save this man is electricity!

25:01.300 --> 25:02.234
Exactly.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.807
This is why I hate
the Renaissance Festival.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.617
Okay, I triaged this thing's
melted guts best I can.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.185
Where's my ferromagnet?
Here it is. Done.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.120
Happy, we need power.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.555
Working on it.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.957
Okay. Okay.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.059
Aluminum foil and a glass bottle
with a cork.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.561
And salt from
the Thanks for Mutton stand.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.563
Okay, bottle, salt, water,
cork, aluminum foil.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.331
Time to make a capacitor.
TOBY: Hurry up.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.901
He's not doing well.
My arms feel like jelly.

25:42.709 --> 25:43.743
All right, done.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.212
Either it works
or it explodes.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.587
The electricity
is back on.

25:54.621 --> 25:57.790
Yeah, that means I'm not making
this capacitor for nothing.

25:57.824 --> 26:00.693
Paige, can you, uh,
do me a favor and yank out

26:00.727 --> 26:02.261
the old capacitor
from the defibrillator?

26:02.294 --> 26:03.262
This thing here?
Yes.

26:03.295 --> 26:04.463
SYLVESTER:
Power is holding.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.666
Now, why don't you go down
to the office and call for help?

26:06.699 --> 26:07.967
My pleasure.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.235
Okay, thanks.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.803
A Leyden jar capacitor.
Nice.

26:10.837 --> 26:13.706
Yeah, it should store and
release enough electricity

26:13.740 --> 26:15.241
to get the defibrillator
back and running again.

26:15.274 --> 26:18.811
Okay, now all I need
is a nail. Oh. That hatpin.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.014
I'll get some juice.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.816
TOBY: All right,
he's running out of steam!

26:26.953 --> 26:28.721
Wire it in.

26:32.792 --> 26:33.826
It's working.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.094
Happy, switch with me.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.302
And... clear!

26:47.273 --> 26:48.708
(defibrillator beeping)

26:48.741 --> 26:50.643
Okay. He's okay.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.244
(exhales)

26:52.278 --> 26:53.345
(defibrillator flatlines)

26:53.379 --> 26:55.682
(defibrillator beeping steadily)
Wait, what the hell?

26:55.715 --> 26:57.750
No, no, no.
It's-it's okay. Look.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.753
(defibrillator flatlines, beeps)
Uh, what's that all about, Doc?

27:00.787 --> 27:02.789
His heart is being choked
by the pericardic blood.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.191
The defib acts
like a pacemaker.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.660
Sensing when his ticker stops,
then it hits reset

27:07.694 --> 27:09.762
by automatically shocking it
back into the rhythm.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.130
He needs to stay hooked up,

27:11.163 --> 27:12.665
but he'll-he'll be okay
until an ambulance gets here.

27:12.699 --> 27:13.900
SYLVESTER (panting):
Okay, well,

27:13.933 --> 27:15.835
that's not gonna be
for a while because traffic

27:15.868 --> 27:18.037
is still backed up
from the blown transformer

27:18.070 --> 27:19.906
and emergency personnel
are spread thin.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.241
Cops and ambulance won't be
here for another 30 minutes.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.342
CABE: We don't
have 30 minutes.

27:23.375 --> 27:27.146
The guys who shot the guard
are on their way here.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.915
What?! Why?!

27:28.948 --> 27:30.983
They can't find the evidence
they're looking for.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.451
The guard they shot is missing

27:32.484 --> 27:34.420
and there's cart tracks
leading back to here.

27:34.453 --> 27:37.256
It's okay. I locked up their bikes.
(gunshots)

27:37.289 --> 27:40.092
That's the sound of people
shooting locks off of chains.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.161
They'll have those bikes
hotwired in minutes.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.096
All right. Let's grab
the guard and scram.

27:44.130 --> 27:44.931
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
And go where?

27:44.964 --> 27:46.799
The-the parking lot
is a mile away

27:46.833 --> 27:48.067
and the service road
is backed up to the 101.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.804
Okay, so we camouflage ourselves
in a mass of hundreds of cars.

27:51.838 --> 27:52.939
That's a no-go.

27:52.972 --> 27:55.708
This man has to stay hooked up
to this defib or he dies.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.209
CABE: Can't we hook
that machine up

27:57.243 --> 27:58.444
to a car battery or something?

27:58.477 --> 28:01.047
That's DC power.
The defib needs AC.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.883
Well, what happens if we just,
uh, give them the evidence?

28:04.917 --> 28:06.385
Besides letting
a murderer go free?

28:06.418 --> 28:08.921
There's no guarantee that
they won't kill us anyway.

28:08.955 --> 28:11.390
Be the smart play.
Leave no witnesses.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.325
I have an idea how we can
protect the evidence

28:13.359 --> 28:15.127
and stop the bikers,
but we're gonna need help,

28:15.161 --> 28:16.228
all of your help.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.869
Yeah, uh, I-I have
sciatica. So...

28:24.503 --> 28:27.006
Giving you my hatpin
is one thing, but...

28:27.039 --> 28:28.340
you're talking
about guys with guns.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.409
Seriously?
None of you will help?

28:30.442 --> 28:33.279
Uh...

28:33.312 --> 28:35.414
Sylvester.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.755
You got to convince
them to work with us.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.757
You do it.
You're the military man.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.859
Exactly why they
won't listen to me.

28:46.893 --> 28:47.994
You speak nerd.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.896
You saw what happens
when I try to speak

28:49.929 --> 28:51.864
with something this big
on the line.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.933
You saw me fail
in court today.

28:55.968 --> 28:58.370
When Timan the Tailor

28:58.404 --> 29:01.440
failed to convince the
vassals to donate crops

29:01.473 --> 29:03.409
to the villagers,
did he give up?

29:03.442 --> 29:05.878
Hell no. He rallied
the peasants

29:05.912 --> 29:07.046
of Winterbourne.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.016
I knew you loved
Chair of Blades.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.818
Of course I do. Who wouldn't
love Chair of Blades?

29:11.851 --> 29:13.085
It's about warriors
battling for the right

29:13.119 --> 29:14.553
to sit on a
chair of blades.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.855
What's more badass
than that?

29:15.888 --> 29:17.957
Now, listen to me,

29:17.990 --> 29:22.228
you're as much a leader
as Timan the Tailor.

29:22.261 --> 29:25.131
It's in you.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.033
Just find it.

29:33.906 --> 29:38.878
Friends, Roman, countrymen,

29:38.911 --> 29:41.347
lend me your ear.

29:41.380 --> 29:45.417
Bullies call us nerds, geeks,

29:45.451 --> 29:47.353
losers.
(crowd muttering assent)

29:47.386 --> 29:50.256
The world shuns our kind.

29:50.289 --> 29:55.094
We have just one safe place:
the Renaissance Festival.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.395
And the Warlock's Chest.

29:56.428 --> 29:59.531
Yes, and the Warlock's Chest.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.400
And sci-fi conventions.

30:01.433 --> 30:02.969
Okay, so we have
three safe places,

30:03.002 --> 30:04.603
but only one of them
is being threatened today.

30:04.636 --> 30:09.375
And we need all of your help
to protect it.

30:09.408 --> 30:14.981
We play games in which
we pretend to be heroes.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.383
But this is your chance

30:17.416 --> 30:20.853
to actually be heroes.

30:20.887 --> 30:23.455
For how can we ever hope

30:23.489 --> 30:26.592
to live long and prosper

30:26.625 --> 30:30.329
if we be cowards now?

30:30.362 --> 30:32.131
So...

30:32.164 --> 30:37.136
so, who will stand with me
against the invading horde

30:37.169 --> 30:40.606
and say,
"You can take our lunch money,

30:40.639 --> 30:45.244
but you will never take
our Renaissance Festival!"

30:45.277 --> 30:47.479
CROWD:
Huzzah! Huzzah!

30:47.513 --> 30:50.316
Huzzah! Huzzah!

30:50.349 --> 30:53.185
(engines revving)
You hear that?

30:53.219 --> 30:55.154
Motorcycle engines.
They're on their way.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.223
Huzzah! Huzzah!

30:57.256 --> 30:59.091
We're all gonna
die here, right?

30:59.125 --> 31:00.893
Yeah, we're totally dead.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.528
Huzzah!

31:02.561 --> 31:04.230
Those bikers can't know that

31:04.263 --> 31:05.998
we're trying to lure them
in or this won't work.

31:06.032 --> 31:07.066
Show me your surprise face.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.370
You surprised
or having a stroke?

31:11.403 --> 31:13.505
All right, here
they come. Places!

31:13.539 --> 31:15.074
Great.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.108
Oh, my God.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.015
Oh, boy.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.103
(all yelling)

31:51.310 --> 31:52.511
Now.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.587
(grunts)

32:01.620 --> 32:03.555
My ankle.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.557
(panting)

32:05.591 --> 32:06.692
Now, that's a surprised face.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.264
(horse neighs)

32:13.632 --> 32:15.367
Huh? (grunts)

32:18.504 --> 32:21.340
(grunts)

32:21.373 --> 32:23.142
(coughs)

32:32.451 --> 32:34.720
Looks like you're going
to the stocks, jackass.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.060
Oh, crap.

32:45.231 --> 32:46.532
Come on, man, you're nothing
but a sitting duck out here.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.968
Come on.
(metal clanging)

32:58.510 --> 32:59.978
ALL:
Huzzah!

33:09.255 --> 33:10.256
Cabe!

33:13.259 --> 33:13.959
(gun clicks)
(gasps)

33:13.992 --> 33:16.362
Drop it.
(defibrillator beeping)

33:17.596 --> 33:19.431
Well, you're the boss.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.469
No! No!

33:23.502 --> 33:25.337
If somebody doesn't give
me that evidence bag,

33:25.371 --> 33:26.472
I'm gonna kill him.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.074
Don't do anything drastic.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.375
Give me the shirt.

33:29.408 --> 33:30.609
No.
I hid it

33:30.642 --> 33:31.710
when you were fighting.
I won't tell you

33:31.743 --> 33:33.345
where it is until
you let him go.

33:33.379 --> 33:34.413
It's not happening.

33:34.446 --> 33:35.414
I will kill him,

33:35.447 --> 33:36.682
and I will kill all of you.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.650
Oh, he's telling the truth.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.119
Good.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.587
'Cause in order
to save this cop's life,

33:41.620 --> 33:43.689
first he has to die.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.103
I'm pulling the
trigger on three.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.439
(defibrillator flatlines,
shocks)

34:00.472 --> 34:01.207
Happy, how much do you trust me?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.609
More than I probably should.
One.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.211
I need you to undo
everything that you did.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.645
Destroy it all.

34:06.678 --> 34:07.779
Oh, man.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.515
I think I know
what you're planning.

34:09.548 --> 34:10.382
Two.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.117
What's he planning?

34:11.150 --> 34:12.318
Something nuts.

34:12.351 --> 34:12.818
Now!

34:22.561 --> 34:24.330
(beeps) (grunts) What the...?

34:29.568 --> 34:33.339
See? I told you that sword
was held in with electricity.

34:33.372 --> 34:34.773
TOBY: Well, speaking of which,
with no electricity,

34:34.806 --> 34:35.874
we just killed this man.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.276
What's the plan, Walt?

34:37.309 --> 34:38.644
Uh, Paige, grab
that spinning wheel.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.380
I'll set up the defibrillator!

34:41.413 --> 34:42.047
SYLVESTER: You're gonna
wrap wool around the hat pin

34:42.080 --> 34:44.216
on the capacitor you built.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.584
And the spinning wheel
will move fast enough to create

34:45.617 --> 34:47.119
a static charge capable

34:47.153 --> 34:48.654
of firing
the defibrillator back up.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.389
Which will fire
his heart back up.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.857
(panting)
Okay.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.725
TOBY: Walt, hurry up! Yep.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.427
Okay, Paige, start peddling.

34:55.461 --> 34:56.595
Okay.

34:56.628 --> 34:57.796
How much power does it make?

34:57.829 --> 34:59.598
Uh, not a lot.
Ed Begley Jr. could barely

34:59.631 --> 35:00.599
make his toast this way.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.434
Well, let's just hope
it's enough to give him

35:02.468 --> 35:04.336
a decent enough jolt
every 90 seconds or so,

35:04.370 --> 35:05.571
or this guy's not gonna make it.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.873
(beeps)
Ready for shock.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.641
All right, hit him!

35:09.675 --> 35:10.676
(steady beep, shocks)

35:12.178 --> 35:14.346
(beeping)

35:14.380 --> 35:16.715
It worked. Uh, he's-he's gonna
need another one soon,

35:16.748 --> 35:17.883
so keep pumping,
Paige.

35:17.916 --> 35:19.418
How long do I have
to keep this going?

35:19.451 --> 35:20.586
Till an ambulance gets here.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.654
We can all take turns.

35:22.688 --> 35:25.257
Feel like your speech really
had an effect on them, kid.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.658
Yeah, I-I...

35:26.692 --> 35:29.195
I can't pedal on account
of my sciatica.

35:29.228 --> 35:31.597
All except that one.
He's a real weenie.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.433
(grunts)

35:35.534 --> 35:36.835
(grunts)

35:36.868 --> 35:38.437
King Phillip?

35:40.239 --> 35:41.673
(grunts)

35:41.707 --> 35:43.342
Were you hiding
in the manure bin?

35:43.375 --> 35:45.377
Good day.

35:47.213 --> 35:48.780
Speaking of weenies.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.625
Just got off the phone
with a cop buddy of mine.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.761
Guard's gonna be okay,
the bikers won't be.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.464
Garage looks...

36:05.497 --> 36:06.932
Looks like
The Hobbit threw up in it.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.734
I was gonna say "perfect."

36:08.767 --> 36:10.669
Next best thing to a birthday
at the Renaissance Festival.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.638
Okay, Sly.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.240
Your little friends are here.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.442
Guys. Y-You came.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.477
I thought you were staying
at the festival.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.446
We would never miss
your birthday bacchanalia,

36:20.479 --> 36:21.680
old friend.
(chuckles)

36:21.713 --> 36:24.483
And besides, the festival's
closed until they fix the power.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.918
Uh, it matters not why.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.587
Just that
we are here.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.590
Now slice the cake
with Raven's Beak,

36:31.623 --> 36:33.325
let the Dr. Shazz
flow free,

36:33.359 --> 36:36.295
for tonight, we dine in Hell!

36:36.328 --> 36:38.664
ALL:
Huzzah!

36:38.697 --> 36:41.667
You know, we never finished what
we started in that hay loft.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.802
A Scorpion outing went sideways.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.804
It happens. A lot.

36:45.837 --> 36:48.874
Okay, well, I can't help notice
there's no pending disaster now.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.809
Well, it depends on how
you define "disaster."

36:50.842 --> 36:52.711
Sly's nerd friends
are preparing to do battle.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.747
Careful. Don't get my eyes.
Ow.

36:55.781 --> 36:58.650
See, that's all the more reason
why we need to get back to work

36:58.684 --> 37:02.454
on Operation Baby Quintis
as soon as possible.

37:02.488 --> 37:05.724
Well, it would be a shame to
waste these stupid costumes.

37:05.757 --> 37:09.561
How about after the party,
we have a party of our own?

37:09.595 --> 37:12.731
Don't have to ask me twice.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.733
Speaking of stupid...

37:14.766 --> 37:16.268
I know it's dumb,

37:16.302 --> 37:20.672
but before we left
the festival, I bought this.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.743
Um, it's supposed
to bring the wearer

37:24.776 --> 37:26.678
good baby-making luck.

37:26.712 --> 37:27.846
I don't believe it, but...

37:27.879 --> 37:30.282
You figured,
"What could it hurt"?

37:30.316 --> 37:31.283
Yeah.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.823
Me, too.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.893
(both shouting)

37:48.700 --> 37:50.035
(strumming guitar)

37:50.068 --> 37:55.674
♪ When I'm with you

37:55.707 --> 37:59.511
♪ It soothes my mind

37:59.545 --> 38:02.881
♪ And I feel fine

38:02.914 --> 38:06.752
♪ I feel fine

38:06.785 --> 38:10.021
♪ When you're with me

38:10.055 --> 38:13.625
♪ My mind can rest

38:13.659 --> 38:16.628
♪ My thoughts can nest

38:16.662 --> 38:20.832
♪ Thoughts can nest

38:20.866 --> 38:22.901
♪ You're the calm

38:22.934 --> 38:26.538
♪ I hold in my arms

38:26.572 --> 38:30.409
♪ The peace that I need

38:30.442 --> 38:33.579
♪ You so disarm.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.681
(strums guitar)

38:37.883 --> 38:39.651
This is stupid.

38:39.685 --> 38:40.919
PAIGE:
Walter?

38:40.952 --> 38:41.887
Um...

38:42.954 --> 38:43.922
Um...

38:43.955 --> 38:46.124
Hey. I just got back
from picking up Ralph.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.927
He's downstairs, putting his
costume on for Sly's party.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.430
I was gonna change back into
mine, if you want to join us.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.599
Yeah, sure. I'll be down in a minute.
Great.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.903
You know, my...

38:57.936 --> 39:01.940
my job with Scorpion
is to help you act more human

39:01.973 --> 39:04.943
so you can function
better in the world,

39:04.976 --> 39:07.946
but I don't want you to pretend

39:07.979 --> 39:12.150
to be someone you're not
to be my boyfriend.

39:12.183 --> 39:15.621
You know, like,
earlier today,

39:15.654 --> 39:17.389
I saw a guy with a stupid crown,

39:17.423 --> 39:19.725
and he was pretending
to be someone he's not.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.928
And then, when push
came to shove, he ran away,

39:22.961 --> 39:26.465
and he showed
his ugly true self.

39:26.498 --> 39:27.833
He hid in feces.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.601
Yes, he... he did.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.603
My-my point is,

39:31.637 --> 39:35.774
is that you are always
your true self, Walter,

39:35.807 --> 39:38.844
and that person
is brave and good,

39:38.877 --> 39:40.846
and I love that about you.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.114
So I just wanted
you to know,

39:43.148 --> 39:48.053
I love a lot about you, whether
you like silly festivals or not.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.827
(chuckles softly)
