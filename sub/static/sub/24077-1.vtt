00:38.321 --> 00:39.387
Attention all units

00:39.389 --> 00:41.387
in the vicinity of
16th and Valencia.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.691
Fire raging out of control
at the Golden Bay Hotel.

00:43.693 --> 00:46.629
Fire Captain
requesting assistance.

00:54.470 --> 00:57.670
Repeat, all units in the
vicinity of 16th and Valencia.

00:57.672 --> 01:00.573
Fire Captain
requesting assistance.

02:21.556 --> 02:23.957
What happened, big guy?

02:23.959 --> 02:26.492
He died of smoke inhalation.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.994
You got any names?

02:27.996 --> 02:28.864
No.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.498
You got some more in the corner.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.736
Jesus Christ.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.213
We ran outta gurneys.

02:54.523 --> 02:58.293
Nobody even knew
these poor bastards.

02:59.394 --> 03:02.528
I could see the process
starting already.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.766
Immigration, tracking clues.

03:08.370 --> 03:12.508
Find hometowns, arrange for
transportation of bodies.

03:14.577 --> 03:17.380
These guys were
human sacrifices.

03:18.381 --> 03:19.649
But to what god?

03:20.916 --> 03:23.450
I needed to see them.

03:23.452 --> 03:27.955
See the corpses so the
rage would keep me going.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.491
This would be tricky.

03:30.493 --> 03:33.527
Nothing was as it appeared.

03:33.529 --> 03:38.331
Even the tall Samoan at the
morgue wasn't Samoan at all.

03:38.333 --> 03:41.434
He was a tall Tongan bastard.

04:38.661 --> 04:43.630
It all started earlier that
evening, around five o'clock,

04:43.632 --> 04:46.967
just as I was getting
ready to leave work.

04:46.969 --> 04:48.135
- Bob?
- Yeah?

04:48.137 --> 04:50.070
I need to meet with
you first thing Monday.

04:50.072 --> 04:52.505
You'll have all
weekend to figure out

04:52.507 --> 04:55.476
what really happened at
the Golden Bay Hotel.

04:55.478 --> 04:56.344
I don't think we
wanna drag ourselves

04:56.346 --> 04:58.544
into something politically, sir.

04:58.546 --> 04:59.945
Listen, Bob.

04:59.947 --> 05:02.649
This is not the kind of job
where you get to pick and choose

05:02.651 --> 05:04.517
which cases you work on.

05:04.519 --> 05:05.786
I cited that hotel three times

05:05.788 --> 05:09.056
but never for a fire hazard,
just the usual stuff,

05:09.058 --> 05:11.625
rats, infestations, garbage.

05:11.627 --> 05:12.659
Had there been a fire hazard,

05:12.661 --> 05:13.926
God himself could
not have stopped me

05:13.928 --> 05:16.462
from citing that landlord
and making him fix it

05:16.464 --> 05:17.630
that goddamned day.

05:17.632 --> 05:18.332
Do you know Bob?

05:18.334 --> 05:20.400
I really don't care.

05:20.402 --> 05:21.501
Mr. Choy.

05:21.503 --> 05:22.770
All I know is your
job is on the line.

05:22.772 --> 05:26.440
On Monday, you bring in
the last inspection report,

05:26.442 --> 05:30.544
and it better damn well
mention the fire hazard.

05:30.546 --> 05:31.611
Well, it won't
mention a fire hazard

05:31.613 --> 05:32.945
because none existed.

05:32.947 --> 05:34.847
Seven people died
in that fire, sir.

05:34.849 --> 05:36.582
Seven people that did
not have to die, okay?

05:36.584 --> 05:39.419
I'm not going to carry
them around, sir.

05:39.421 --> 05:41.823
They're not my dead, Mr. Choy.

05:45.827 --> 05:49.563
They didn't have to die,
goddamn it, you hear me?

05:49.565 --> 05:51.901
They didn't have to die, sir.

05:53.435 --> 05:54.404
You hear me?

05:59.207 --> 06:02.077
What's wrong with
this department?

06:04.212 --> 06:05.947
Fucking bureaucrats.

06:37.812 --> 06:40.981
I make my bones as a
humble housing inspector.

06:40.983 --> 06:45.120
I make sure rats and people
don't share the same space.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.121
I learned to navigate the
back alleys of the mission

06:49.123 --> 06:53.025
as a kid, running these
streets in the barrio,

06:53.027 --> 06:54.663
we owned the place.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.501
On the dirty, low-down
underbelly side of town,

07:01.503 --> 07:04.570
these garages
turned into in laws

07:04.572 --> 07:07.207
where three families
lived packed in tight,

07:07.209 --> 07:09.743
desperate as boat people.

07:09.745 --> 07:12.979
The closets redone into
master bedroom suites.

07:12.981 --> 07:14.113
Got a hot plate?

07:14.115 --> 07:15.050
Plug it in.

07:17.151 --> 07:20.587
And now these techie culture
vultures are walking around,

07:20.589 --> 07:21.822
and the post-bubble hipsters

07:21.824 --> 07:25.291
are popping up like
pimples on a junkie's arm.

07:25.293 --> 07:26.460
You can see them
pushing baby strollers

07:26.462 --> 07:29.930
and eating their gelato,
cruising their Beamers

07:29.932 --> 07:31.934
and $3,000 peddle bikes.

07:33.067 --> 07:33.899
Calculating how
much it would take

07:33.901 --> 07:36.505
to run everybody out of here.

07:48.884 --> 07:52.085
Don't get me wrong, this
city's a beautiful place

07:52.087 --> 07:55.757
but where I live, it's
truly another barrio.

08:26.788 --> 08:27.921
Good evening.

08:27.923 --> 08:30.056
It was on the corner
of 16th and Valencia,

08:30.058 --> 08:33.860
the Golden Bay Hotel, a
once elegant residence

08:33.861 --> 08:38.164
for out of town visitors,
tonight a pile of burnt lumber.

08:38.166 --> 08:41.000
Recently, the Golden Bay
had been a run-down refuge

08:41.001 --> 08:44.135
for the unemployed and
displaced families.

08:44.138 --> 08:46.039
There were seven fatalities.

08:46.041 --> 08:49.241
Our own Rigo Chacon
has the story.

08:49.243 --> 08:50.643
Rigo.

08:50.645 --> 08:51.811
The fire broke out at about
three o'clock in the morning.

08:51.813 --> 08:53.212
There were witnesses,
many of them coming out

08:53.214 --> 08:56.917
of this neighborhood bar when
they looked across the street

08:56.919 --> 08:58.818
and saw a raging fire.

08:58.820 --> 09:01.254
One of them called 911.

09:01.256 --> 09:05.595
'Cause it is Saturday night
every night at Esta Noche.

09:08.097 --> 09:10.833

11:47.055 --> 11:50.856
What are
you doing around here?

11:50.858 --> 11:52.795
Investigating a fire.

11:54.563 --> 11:57.233
You hear anything about a fire?

11:59.434 --> 12:01.103
Maybe, maybe not.

12:09.945 --> 12:11.680
What have you heard?

12:15.517 --> 12:17.453
Let's watch the show.

12:38.406 --> 12:40.874
Jessi, excellent show.

12:40.876 --> 12:41.842
Thank you.

12:41.844 --> 12:42.409
- Terrific energy.
- Thank you.

12:42.411 --> 12:43.242
I mean it.

12:43.244 --> 12:46.114
What did you see that night?

12:48.382 --> 12:49.951
What did you see?

12:51.320 --> 12:54.520
I was standing right here

12:54.522 --> 12:55.255
- with Nido.
- Okay.

12:55.257 --> 12:56.323
When all of a sudden,

12:56.325 --> 12:58.491
the flames just shot
out all at once.

12:58.493 --> 13:01.528
- Take it easy.
- It was just like a whoosh!

13:01.530 --> 13:04.733
Licking up the side
of the building.

13:06.068 --> 13:07.399
The flames didn't come
from inside the building?

13:07.401 --> 13:09.001
No,.

13:09.003 --> 13:09.903
You sure?

13:09.905 --> 13:11.571
From the outside.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.472
What else did you see?

13:13.474 --> 13:15.411
Two men running away.

13:16.445 --> 13:17.778
Are you sure about that?

13:17.780 --> 13:22.281
I'm sure they were men,
as sure as I'm La Jessica.

13:22.283 --> 13:26.252
These men that you saw,
could you identify them, Jessi?

13:26.254 --> 13:27.187
Maybe.

13:27.189 --> 13:27.920
Maybe, maybe's
not good enough.

13:27.922 --> 13:29.121
Could you identify them?

13:29.123 --> 13:30.155
Well.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.524
What did they look like?

13:32.526 --> 13:33.760
Well they had big muscles.

13:33.762 --> 13:37.163
They were, you know.

13:37.165 --> 13:39.466
All right, okay,
thank you for that.

13:39.468 --> 13:40.634
Listen, that's
good enough for me.

13:40.636 --> 13:42.635
That and what you saw.

13:42.637 --> 13:44.172
So uh, thank you.

14:16.204 --> 14:18.138
- Heh-hey.
- Hey man, what's up?

14:18.140 --> 14:20.106
What's up, brother?

14:20.108 --> 14:22.274
What you pourin'
tonight, what you got?

14:24.046 --> 14:25.111
What are you servin'
today, brother?

14:25.113 --> 14:28.316
- All right.
- A glass of vino for you.

14:29.450 --> 14:30.985
Little Chilean.

14:32.988 --> 14:33.819
Try it.

14:33.821 --> 14:35.989
- It looks good.
- Try it.

14:48.136 --> 14:49.238
Nice, nice.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.273
Sensational, man.

14:53.275 --> 14:55.342
I love it here, I
love it here, brother.

14:55.344 --> 14:56.443
You
need some more?

14:56.445 --> 14:58.278
I'm good, I'm good,
I'm good, I'm good.

14:58.280 --> 15:01.514
What's that song playing, man?

15:01.516 --> 15:03.449
It reminds me of something.

15:03.451 --> 15:04.417
Man.

15:04.419 --> 15:05.986
What is that?

15:05.988 --> 15:08.321
Reminds me of
Compay Segundo, man.

15:08.323 --> 15:09.621
That's it, that's it.

15:09.623 --> 15:13.726
You know, his real name
was Francisco Repilado?

15:13.728 --> 15:15.595
Repilado.

15:15.597 --> 15:19.466
Checked out after 93 years
of smokin' them cigars.

15:19.468 --> 15:20.199
No shit.

15:20.201 --> 15:21.433
No shit.

15:21.435 --> 15:22.503
- Wow.
- Yeah.

15:25.172 --> 15:26.072
Checked out.

15:26.074 --> 15:26.942
Gone.

15:28.477 --> 15:31.276
This year, my amigo, poet
and brother Piedro Petri

15:31.278 --> 15:33.380
had moved on to
the other barrio.

15:33.382 --> 15:37.518
Petey Thomas before him, and
Victor Martinez, rest in peace.

15:41.422 --> 15:44.624
And today was the anniversary
of my compandre's death,

15:44.626 --> 15:46.629
whom I'd known 30 years.

15:48.296 --> 15:49.562
And now, there were seven more

15:49.564 --> 15:51.630
who checked into
the other barrio,

15:51.632 --> 15:53.665
took that one way ticket
on the mission 14 line

15:53.667 --> 15:58.170
all the way to the cemeteries
in Colma, California.

15:58.172 --> 15:59.440
Blood of Christ.

16:03.545 --> 16:07.047
God damn, the dead
were all around me.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.049
Urging me to keep on living.

16:10.051 --> 16:12.353
To keep their memories alive.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.627
Hey man, I gotta go.

16:21.629 --> 16:23.196
Thank you so much much, brother.

16:23.198 --> 16:23.865
All right.

16:25.099 --> 16:26.433
Appreciate it, all right?

16:26.435 --> 16:28.300
That sounds good,
I like that music.

16:28.302 --> 16:29.369
Take care, man.

16:29.371 --> 16:29.903
Some good shit,
that wine's good.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.136
All right.

16:31.138 --> 16:32.340
Muchas gracias.

16:33.642 --> 16:35.611
- De nada.
- Thank you.

16:38.613 --> 16:39.712
Whoa man, what's up?

16:39.714 --> 16:41.146
You Morales?

16:41.148 --> 16:42.582
Who the fuck's askin'?

16:42.584 --> 16:45.485
Mike Callahan wants
to speak to you.

16:45.487 --> 16:46.619
Callahan wants to see me?

16:46.621 --> 16:47.687
Well Callahan's not
on my social calendar.

16:47.689 --> 16:51.293
Hey, hey, that's
twice, what the fuck?

16:55.629 --> 16:57.630
Fuckin' great.

16:57.632 --> 16:59.765
Let's go see Callahan, man.

16:59.767 --> 17:02.738
All right, let's
go, curious guy.

17:26.260 --> 17:28.061
We going to Jersey?

17:33.301 --> 17:37.603
That's what Michael Corleone
said in The Godfather.

17:37.605 --> 17:40.540
And Sollozo said maybe, and
McClusky's sitting right there,

17:40.542 --> 17:42.542
I kind of feel like
Huey and Dewey,

17:42.544 --> 17:46.681
you guys are like some big
time Godfather muscle, eh?

17:49.316 --> 17:51.217
Callahan still signing
your checks, eh?

17:51.219 --> 17:55.289
Keeps you dressed nice in
your fine black leathers.

17:56.690 --> 18:00.429
I think you guys might be
some Russian river muscle.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.465
Your boss walks around City
Hall like he owns the place,

18:05.467 --> 18:06.435
doesn't he?

18:10.538 --> 18:14.308
You guys know seven
people died in that fire?

18:16.344 --> 18:18.311
I think you care,
Huey and Dewey,

18:18.313 --> 18:20.546
but you're not allowed
to show emotion.

18:20.548 --> 18:24.717
What you lookin' at?

18:24.719 --> 18:26.518
Well let me tell you
man, old school mission.

18:26.520 --> 18:29.589
The low riders and the homies,

18:29.591 --> 18:32.594
they're in the other
barrio already.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.829
Why don't you come down
to The Mission, man?

18:36.831 --> 18:39.599
We'll have doughnuts at the
old Hunt's Doughnut Shop,

18:39.601 --> 18:43.738
number 14 bus comes along the
Mission 14, we'll jump on it.

18:46.874 --> 18:50.743
Give you a tour of
the other barrio.

18:50.745 --> 18:53.482
Punch a one way ticket to Colma.

18:55.316 --> 18:59.485
That's where seven people
are headed right now.

18:59.487 --> 19:01.720
Sittin' at the fuckin'
morgue office right now.

19:01.722 --> 19:03.223
Does Callahan give
a fuck about that?

19:03.225 --> 19:06.094
I know you do,
Huey and Dewey, eh?

19:07.796 --> 19:10.429
Fuckin' beautiful
neighborhood, man.

19:10.431 --> 19:12.465
That was the real mission,
that's what we're losin'.

19:12.467 --> 19:15.270
Huey and Dewey,
how come Callahan

19:16.604 --> 19:19.874
ain't fighting for
the old mission, huh?

19:20.775 --> 19:23.775
Clooney's and The Dover Club,

19:23.777 --> 19:28.348
the last old white men
bars of The Mission, eh?

19:28.350 --> 19:29.649
'Cause if you know
about The Mission,

19:29.651 --> 19:31.016
you know, you know,
you know, man,

19:31.018 --> 19:34.355
but if you don't
know, you don't know.

19:36.357 --> 19:37.957
Fuck you Huey and Dewey.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.524
Grow a pair, will you?

19:39.526 --> 19:41.593
Get a conscience.

19:41.595 --> 19:45.733
God bless you, all right,
get me the fuck outta here.

19:56.245 --> 19:58.780
He's at the end of the pier.

19:59.847 --> 20:02.416
I used to go fishing there.

20:04.652 --> 20:06.686
You should try fishing.

20:37.084 --> 20:39.821
Mr. Morales, you smoke cigars?

20:43.091 --> 20:45.057
So what you so pissed off about?

20:45.059 --> 20:46.727
Go on, spit it out.

20:48.462 --> 20:50.463
I cited The Golden Bay Hotel.

20:50.465 --> 20:51.496
The one that burned.

20:51.498 --> 20:53.065
Not for fire hazard.

20:53.067 --> 20:55.767
'Cause a fire
hazard didn't exist.

20:55.769 --> 20:56.835
I don't follow you.

20:56.837 --> 20:59.371
It burned down on
my watch, Callahan.

20:59.373 --> 21:01.040
I'm a fall guy, I don't
like being a fall guy.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.742
If that's
what you're worried about...

21:02.744 --> 21:05.044
No, I'm worried about
seven people that died.

21:05.046 --> 21:06.345
Okay, it wasn't an accident.

21:06.347 --> 21:08.482
It was a flea bag hotel.

21:09.718 --> 21:10.883
Everything changes.

21:10.885 --> 21:12.552
You should know it was
against city ordinance

21:12.554 --> 21:13.753
to tear down low income housing.

21:13.755 --> 21:15.021
I think you know that.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.756
Hey, someone was careless.

21:17.758 --> 21:19.524
That's the way to look at it.

21:19.526 --> 21:21.960
It won't be an
inconvenience to you.

21:21.962 --> 21:24.030
I can't explain
inconvenience to seven families

21:24.032 --> 21:26.735
of seven corpses at the morgue.

21:27.669 --> 21:30.002
You see that, that there?

21:30.004 --> 21:32.938
Let me tell you, it was
the highway to the future.

21:32.940 --> 21:37.642
You can ride it, or you can,
well, be run over by it.

21:37.644 --> 21:40.449
Looks like a
fuckin' nightmare.

21:42.383 --> 21:45.918
I'm gonna find out
how that fire started.

21:45.920 --> 21:49.389
Just so you know, Mr. Callahan.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.524
You have a loft
that's not warranted.

21:51.526 --> 21:52.958
I've bot permits, man.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.127
Hey, that's a
matter of opinion.

21:54.129 --> 21:56.496
One of your neighbors
might file a complaint,

21:56.498 --> 21:58.430
say it's illegal.

21:58.432 --> 22:00.432
We're all illegal,
except the Ohlone,

22:00.434 --> 22:01.633
and we destroyed
them a century ago.

22:01.635 --> 22:03.936
What are you,
some kind of do-gooder?

22:03.938 --> 22:07.540
I found religion after
that fire, Mr. Callahan.

22:07.542 --> 22:11.544
Look, Morales, nobody
appreciates a smart ass like you

22:11.546 --> 22:13.678
stirring up trouble
for other people.

22:13.680 --> 22:17.682
Let me remind you,
with your illegal loft,

22:17.684 --> 22:22.121
your shit smells just as
bad, so think about it.

22:22.123 --> 22:23.255
By the time
Callahan was finished

22:23.257 --> 22:26.024
poking his 1% manicured
finger in my chest,

22:26.026 --> 22:29.661
I realized the seven
dead from the motel fire

22:29.663 --> 22:32.732
weren't even a part of the 99%.

22:32.734 --> 22:34.033
I'll walk home.

22:34.035 --> 22:36.803
Fighting City Hall would
be a hell of a lot easier

22:36.805 --> 22:40.573
without these heartless
pricks on my back.

22:40.575 --> 22:42.707
Ah, at least I ain't no
Sears and Roebuck Indian.

22:42.709 --> 22:45.445
I knew me an Indian
once named Trader Joe.

24:32.886 --> 24:34.152
I had to find out who might
have something to gain

24:34.154 --> 24:37.188
by torching The Golden Bay.

24:37.190 --> 24:40.560
The listed donor was a
one F. Delgado et al.

24:40.562 --> 24:43.696
Address, something something
south Van Ness Avenue.

24:43.698 --> 24:46.998
One of those old Victorian
mansions from another century

24:47.000 --> 24:49.470
and the heart of the barrio.

25:15.896 --> 25:16.762
No F. Delgado?

25:16.764 --> 25:17.463
No.

25:17.465 --> 25:18.630
Senora Lopez's house.

25:18.632 --> 25:23.768
Lopez house.

25:23.770 --> 25:24.637
What's the matter?

25:24.639 --> 25:26.237
Senora, hey.

25:26.239 --> 25:27.773
Hey, Roberto.

25:27.775 --> 25:29.609
Hey, Sophia.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.043
What are you doing here?

25:31.045 --> 25:33.715
I'm looking for a F. Delgado.

25:35.650 --> 25:37.283
I don't know any F. Delgado.

25:37.285 --> 25:38.618
This is my aunt's house.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.018
Your aunt's house.

25:40.020 --> 25:40.887
Yes, I'm her attorney.

25:40.889 --> 25:42.621
Maybe I can talk to your aunt?

25:42.623 --> 25:44.756
What's this about, Roberto?

25:44.758 --> 25:47.192
Are you with the
police, I mean...

25:47.194 --> 25:50.729
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm not with the police.

25:50.731 --> 25:51.965
Not the police at all.

25:51.967 --> 25:55.670
Investigating some housing
business and stuff.

25:57.171 --> 25:58.169
Okay.

25:58.171 --> 25:59.537
Sophia.

25:59.539 --> 26:01.841
Okay well um, my aunt can't
talk to anybody right now,

26:01.843 --> 26:03.175
she's sick.

26:03.177 --> 26:05.076
She's sick.

26:05.078 --> 26:05.945
I'm sorry.

26:05.947 --> 26:08.683
Mm, maybe she's better, I can?

26:09.651 --> 26:10.850
Maybe.

26:10.852 --> 26:14.687
But you know, now's not
a good time, I gotta go.

26:14.689 --> 26:16.557
I have an appointment.

26:18.026 --> 26:19.391
I understand.

26:19.393 --> 26:20.392
Can I give
you a ride anywhere?

26:20.394 --> 26:21.593
I'm going to
16th and Valencia.

26:21.595 --> 26:24.030
Maybe if you could drop
me off, that'd be great.

26:40.148 --> 26:41.913
I hardly
even recognize you.

26:41.915 --> 26:43.317
It's been a while.

26:44.852 --> 26:46.419
So you're working for the city?

26:46.421 --> 26:47.753
Department of
building inspections.

26:47.755 --> 26:50.389
Crack down on deadbeat landlords

26:50.391 --> 26:55.093
that don't provide livable,
habitable living spaces

26:55.095 --> 26:56.329
for people.

26:56.331 --> 27:00.569
Worked in Chinatown,
Western addition, Filmore.

27:01.936 --> 27:05.438
What on earth is going on in
the Mission, rent's so high.

27:05.440 --> 27:08.843
We're focused right
here in the barrio.

27:09.844 --> 27:11.877
That makes sense.

27:11.879 --> 27:13.949
Got a woman in your life?

27:15.115 --> 27:16.916
Yeah, no.

27:16.918 --> 27:17.752
Yes, no.

27:20.254 --> 27:20.919
Yes or no?

27:20.921 --> 27:22.353
Amanda left me.

27:22.355 --> 27:23.223
She did?

27:26.294 --> 27:28.259
I'm a loser.

27:28.261 --> 27:30.763
Our formerly happy loft
space that we lived in

27:30.765 --> 27:34.902
is a sad space now, and I try
not to spend any time there,

27:36.837 --> 27:40.975
so I basically hang out in
nameless, faceless bars.

27:44.478 --> 27:45.745
You do that, so
you're telling me

27:45.747 --> 27:47.979
you lost your way with women.

27:47.981 --> 27:51.619
I lost my way with
women when I lost you.

27:54.354 --> 27:59.091
Yeah, hey um, there's a band
playing tonight from New York.

27:59.093 --> 28:02.160
I just feel like
some live music.

28:02.162 --> 28:05.099
I want it to blow
right through me.

28:07.235 --> 28:08.703
Feel like maybe?

28:10.771 --> 28:11.639
Why not?

28:13.074 --> 28:15.040
Screw it, who cares.

28:15.042 --> 28:17.309
When's the last
time you went dancing?

28:17.311 --> 28:20.180
1999.

28:21.215 --> 28:24.850
Old school.

28:24.852 --> 28:26.118
I was there, I remember.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.189
Yeah you were.

28:34.562 --> 28:37.362
So pick me up in
front of the can factory

28:37.364 --> 28:40.265
about a quarter to nine, okay?

28:40.267 --> 28:41.801
We'll take it from there.

28:41.803 --> 28:42.671
All right.

28:45.439 --> 28:47.473
Keep it real, counselor.

28:47.475 --> 28:48.776
Later, Kenny.

29:10.597 --> 29:13.364
The word was already
out on the street.

29:13.366 --> 29:15.868
This was a frame job.

29:15.870 --> 29:17.169
The bulldozers and
the wrecking balls

29:17.171 --> 29:19.470
stood poised to knock down
the side of the building

29:19.472 --> 29:23.374
facing Valencia Street,
but the fire had started

29:23.376 --> 29:25.379
on the 16th Street side.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.113
It was becoming obvious to
me what had happened here,

29:29.115 --> 29:32.117
something caught fire
in the passageway,

29:32.119 --> 29:34.085
right underneath
the fire escape.

29:34.087 --> 29:35.854
And the sons of bitches,

29:35.856 --> 29:37.090
they could've spared
the fire escape,

29:37.092 --> 29:40.092
giving those trapped
inside a chance to get out,

29:40.094 --> 29:43.097
but they hadn't
even given 'em that.

29:44.198 --> 29:46.767
These people, they
had no chance.

29:51.639 --> 29:52.505
Morales, what
the hell are you doing?

29:52.507 --> 29:55.040
Taking pictures of the site.

29:55.042 --> 29:56.307
For your scrapbook?

29:56.309 --> 29:57.342
Get the fuck outta here.

29:57.344 --> 29:58.476
If someone's
destroying evidence,

29:58.478 --> 29:59.277
someone has the right
to do that, officer.

29:59.279 --> 30:00.312
Well, you're a day late.

30:00.314 --> 30:02.915
The DA has all the
photos he needs.

30:02.917 --> 30:04.483
How can he?

30:04.485 --> 30:06.150
Someone's fuckin'
destroying the site.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.419
Are you doubting me,
you flat-ass Mexican?

30:07.421 --> 30:11.890
Flat-ass Mexican, that's
all you got, officer?

30:11.892 --> 30:14.525
Look man, seven people died
here, I'm gonna find out why.

30:14.527 --> 30:18.063
Oh, I bet you are because
it's on your ass now, isn't it?

30:18.065 --> 30:20.332
You're the one who
overlooked the fire hazards,

30:20.334 --> 30:22.001
and now it's on your conscience.

30:22.003 --> 30:24.370
If faggot liberals like
you have a conscience,

30:24.372 --> 30:25.905
is that right?

30:25.907 --> 30:27.139
Have it your way, genius.

30:27.141 --> 30:28.908
Thank you, officers.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.146
Have a good day, brilliant.

30:37.485 --> 30:39.284
It was clear someone was
trying to bury this thing

30:39.286 --> 30:41.120
and bury it quick.

30:41.122 --> 30:44.089
It was too messy for
them, but who were they?

30:44.091 --> 30:46.592
Who was F. Delgado and et al?

30:46.594 --> 30:48.294
Who owned the goddamn hotel?

30:48.296 --> 30:50.062
So I figured it
something like this.

30:50.064 --> 30:53.299
Sophia's aunt was part
of the et al, yeah.

30:53.301 --> 30:55.668
And Sophia was lying
to protect her.

30:55.670 --> 30:59.071
Or, Sophia didn't know
shit about anything,

30:59.073 --> 31:02.341
but as her aunt's attorney,
that seemed far-fetched.

31:02.343 --> 31:03.942
Here you go,.

31:03.944 --> 31:05.544
Hey, that looks great.

31:05.546 --> 31:07.545
Looks delicious.

31:07.547 --> 31:08.546
You're welcome.

31:08.548 --> 31:10.582
That's for you.

31:10.584 --> 31:11.749
Aye, senor Roberto.

31:11.751 --> 31:15.019
Thank you, my family
really appreciates it.

31:15.021 --> 31:16.153
I know you do.

31:16.155 --> 31:20.225
It's for your vacation
to San Pedro Sula.

31:20.227 --> 31:21.259
See, Sula.

31:21.261 --> 31:23.428
I got it right, Sula.

31:23.430 --> 31:26.165
I love your Ecuadorian flag.

31:26.167 --> 31:28.169
- Hondurena.
- Hondurena.

31:30.004 --> 31:32.504
Miss Mary, I favor
to ask of you.

31:32.506 --> 31:33.373
Okay.

31:35.075 --> 31:37.442
I wondered if you
would keep these things

31:37.444 --> 31:39.978
here in the restaurant
for a couple of days only.

31:39.980 --> 31:41.412
Okay.

31:41.414 --> 31:42.982
Put them somewhere
no one can find them.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.315
I trust you.

31:44.317 --> 31:45.319
There it is.

31:48.154 --> 31:51.255
Honey, with a tip like that,
I'll do anything you want.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.559
Don't say that.

31:54.461 --> 31:55.329
Thank you.

32:31.565 --> 32:32.430
- Morales.
- Yeah?

32:33.299 --> 32:34.332
Aw, shit.

32:34.801 --> 32:35.904
Hey.

32:37.638 --> 32:39.271
Nothing wrong with being a

32:39.273 --> 32:40.208
you fucker.

32:41.241 --> 32:42.109
Oh no.

32:44.111 --> 32:45.177
Hella got my briefcase.

32:45.179 --> 32:46.011
Come on.

32:46.013 --> 32:46.745
Tell me about it in the car.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.650
Son of a bitch.

33:05.132 --> 33:05.964
You would do anything

33:05.966 --> 33:07.533
to come to my place tonight.

33:07.535 --> 33:09.234
Yeah.

33:09.236 --> 33:10.305
That's funny.

33:13.340 --> 33:14.208
Ooh.

33:16.076 --> 33:19.210
I didn't even see their
goddamn faces, these bastards.

33:19.212 --> 33:21.345
The
neighborhood's going to shit.

33:21.347 --> 33:23.215
It's getting so violent.

33:23.217 --> 33:24.615
I don't think
that's what it was.

33:24.617 --> 33:26.317
Then what else could it be?

33:26.319 --> 33:27.686
I don't know yet,
I don't know yet,

33:27.688 --> 33:30.354
it's something, something's
going on, I mean, thank you.

33:30.356 --> 33:31.022
Thank you.

33:31.024 --> 33:32.627
Careful girl, now.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.395
- Easy, easy.
- Sorry.

33:37.198 --> 33:39.363
Does blood make you nervous?

33:39.365 --> 33:40.498
No.

33:40.500 --> 33:41.766
Just take it easy, will you?

33:41.768 --> 33:42.636
Okay.

33:50.744 --> 33:53.081
I killed a guy one time.

33:55.815 --> 33:57.517
I was 17 years old.

33:59.385 --> 34:01.120
Stupid ass teenage gang shit,

34:01.122 --> 34:04.523
and we thought we
were gangsters.

34:04.525 --> 34:05.556
This was kickin' my ass

34:05.558 --> 34:07.426
all his boys were
surrounding me,

34:07.428 --> 34:09.563
I thought they were gonna.

34:12.299 --> 34:16.534
There was a pipe on the
ground, I picked it up.

34:16.536 --> 34:19.270
I just kept hitting the.

34:19.272 --> 34:22.309
I just, hitting him
over, over, over,

34:24.409 --> 34:27.145
till he was dead, he was

34:27.147 --> 34:28.013
you know?

34:28.014 --> 34:29.348
Why are you telling me this?

34:29.350 --> 34:32.417
I don't, I don't know, I've
never told anyone before,

34:32.418 --> 34:33.286
I've just.

34:37.924 --> 34:39.525
Can I ask you a question?

34:39.527 --> 34:40.395
Yeah?

34:43.397 --> 34:44.929
Can you be trusted?

34:44.931 --> 34:46.031
What do you wanna ask me?

34:46.033 --> 34:47.565
Goddamn it, Sophia,
can you be trusted?

34:47.567 --> 34:48.366
Yes, I can be trusted.

34:48.368 --> 34:49.567
What do you wanna ask me?

34:49.569 --> 34:50.571
Your aunt.

34:52.806 --> 34:53.674
Your aunt.

34:59.812 --> 35:01.480
She's powerful.

35:01.482 --> 35:02.750
Yeah, no shit.

35:05.819 --> 35:07.451
She knows too much about me.

35:07.453 --> 35:08.455
Like what?

35:11.692 --> 35:13.828
She provides the fronts.

35:14.828 --> 35:16.694
I cook up the contracts.

35:16.696 --> 35:19.332
I make sure everything's legal.

35:21.268 --> 35:22.366
You're talkin'
about apartments?

35:22.368 --> 35:24.835
It's an insurance scam.

35:24.837 --> 35:26.471
Plus with that hotel going down,

35:26.473 --> 35:29.241
they can build something new.

35:29.243 --> 35:30.676
They could make a lot of money.

35:30.678 --> 35:33.114
- Holy shit.
- A few million.

35:34.781 --> 35:35.880
Every apartment
fire in the nation

35:35.882 --> 35:37.248
since the 70s, 80s, and 90s,

35:37.250 --> 35:41.553
those apartments are now
condos and upper class spaces.

35:41.555 --> 35:42.955
Is this what we're
talking about?

35:42.957 --> 35:44.225
Hello, yes.

35:47.761 --> 35:49.694
What's her real goddamn name?

35:49.696 --> 35:52.797
Ahora Felicia Delgado Lopez.

35:52.799 --> 35:53.667
Shit.

35:54.535 --> 35:56.368
I think she ordered the fire.

35:56.370 --> 35:57.402
Wait a minute, wait a minute,

35:57.404 --> 35:58.636
why are you saying
that, counselor?

35:58.638 --> 36:02.641
You can't just throw
that out there like that.

36:02.643 --> 36:05.646
She's got the
mayor in one pocket.

36:06.913 --> 36:10.718
She's got the chief of
police in the other pocket.

36:12.652 --> 36:14.620
There's just a lot
of money involved,

36:14.622 --> 36:17.422
a lot of people
involved, and it's just,

36:17.424 --> 36:20.228
you can't stand
up to them, okay?

36:22.562 --> 36:24.131
They'll hurt you.

36:27.835 --> 36:30.438
They'll hurt you bad, Roberto.

36:31.672 --> 36:34.672
I just, everyone
involved, a lot of money,

36:34.674 --> 36:36.810
the Builder's Association,

36:37.910 --> 36:40.747
they got a blueprint
for The Mission.

36:41.948 --> 36:43.315
I just met with
this contractor,

36:43.317 --> 36:45.453
Callahan, out at the pier.

36:46.553 --> 36:48.855
Shit like that, Jesus Christ.

36:52.359 --> 36:55.296
You're gonna have
to decide, Sophia.

36:56.629 --> 36:58.429
It's your choice,
it's your conscience.

36:58.431 --> 37:00.632
I have the documentation.

37:00.634 --> 37:02.236
It's in my office.

37:03.404 --> 37:04.803
I have a witness
named La Jessica,

37:04.805 --> 37:07.505
a terrific dancer,
a great person,

37:07.507 --> 37:08.707
I mean maybe the three of us,

37:08.709 --> 37:10.908
we could finally bring
down this whole bitch.

37:10.910 --> 37:12.576
I mean, we gotta nail
her to the ground.

37:12.578 --> 37:15.013
I'm sorry, I know
she's your aunt,

37:15.015 --> 37:17.451
but this, we gotta get her.

37:23.424 --> 37:27.295
What's up with that
flaming broad right there?

37:28.728 --> 37:29.730
Purgatory.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.000
Where'd you get it?

37:36.002 --> 37:37.435
It was a gift.

37:37.437 --> 37:38.838
Why is it there?

37:41.507 --> 37:43.910
Our souls, cleanse our sins.

37:45.346 --> 37:47.346
Who gave it to you?

37:47.348 --> 37:48.216
My aunt.

37:49.783 --> 37:50.651
Delgado.

37:51.984 --> 37:52.852
Fuck me.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.757
Do you trust me?

38:00.993 --> 38:03.230
Do you trust me, Roberto?

38:12.638 --> 38:13.904
Can I trust you?

38:13.906 --> 38:15.774
You can trust me.

38:15.776 --> 38:17.645
That's the question.

38:20.413 --> 38:21.681
I can trust you?

38:36.529 --> 38:38.598
I still love you, Sophia.

38:45.705 --> 38:49.507
I can trust you, but
I just gotta know.

38:49.509 --> 38:50.975
What?

38:50.977 --> 38:52.844
Are you wearing a
wire, do you know?

38:52.846 --> 38:53.645
No.

38:53.647 --> 38:54.446
Are you wearing a wire?

38:54.448 --> 38:55.612
I'm not wearing a wire.

38:55.614 --> 38:56.915
How do I know, (speaks
in foreign language)?

38:56.917 --> 38:58.850
I don't know, maybe your
aunt, she put one on you,

38:58.852 --> 38:59.551
you don't even know.

38:59.553 --> 39:00.217
I don't think she...

39:00.219 --> 39:01.685
She's powerful.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.423
God, she's powerful.

39:07.593 --> 39:12.563
I have to do a full body
cavity search for the wire.

39:12.565 --> 39:14.035
Get this hair down.

39:17.036 --> 39:20.774
Easy, it's just hair,
hair makes me nervous.

39:22.442 --> 39:23.310
Ooh.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.491
I gotta get outta
here, it's late.

39:40.493 --> 39:42.159
I'm tired, terrific
show, once again,

39:42.161 --> 39:43.728
thank you so much.

39:43.730 --> 39:45.596
Oh no, papi, going home alone?

39:45.598 --> 39:46.466
Well.

39:50.203 --> 39:51.270
I'll be sifting for evidence.

39:51.272 --> 39:52.404
Maybe you can come
talk to me again?

39:52.406 --> 39:54.105
We'll talk more about
this man, I'm sorry.

39:54.107 --> 39:55.609
Happy birthday.

39:58.011 --> 40:00.645
Thank you, thank you
for the information.

40:00.647 --> 40:02.246
It's very courageous of you.

40:02.248 --> 40:03.781
Seven people died last night.

40:03.783 --> 40:05.385
Good night, Jessi.

40:19.065 --> 40:22.602
They fuck
everybody say fuck 'em.

40:33.013 --> 40:33.881
The fuck?

40:35.748 --> 40:36.616
Oh shit.

40:38.218 --> 40:39.085
Sophia.

40:46.926 --> 40:47.794
Sophia?

40:52.165 --> 40:53.500
What the hell?

40:54.167 --> 40:55.736
There you are, eh?

40:57.236 --> 40:58.705
Well, thank you.

41:00.540 --> 41:03.743
Morning paper in bed,
yeah I like that.

41:08.649 --> 41:11.149
The headline sent a
shock right through me.

41:11.151 --> 41:12.884
La Jessica had been
found stabbed to death

41:12.886 --> 41:14.185
in her hotel room.

41:14.187 --> 41:16.221
Son of a bitch.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.522
The paper was
speculating that a John

41:17.524 --> 41:20.225
angry at having discovered
Jesus instead of Jessica

41:20.227 --> 41:24.763
had taken out his male
rage with a 12-inch blade.

41:24.765 --> 41:26.765
Well, I wasn't so convinced.

41:26.767 --> 41:29.833
La Jessica was
flirtatious, but hey,

41:29.835 --> 41:31.939
the lady was not a whore.

41:44.917 --> 41:47.152
Fucker.

41:53.759 --> 41:55.359
She knew too much.

41:55.361 --> 41:57.629
Everybody knows that
place was torched.

41:57.631 --> 41:59.330
I didn't even know
she had enemies, man.

41:59.332 --> 42:00.200
It's sad.

42:01.335 --> 42:02.734
She didn't.

42:02.736 --> 42:03.402
She walked alone that night,.

42:03.404 --> 42:04.203
That's messed up.

42:04.205 --> 42:07.074
Very sorry about Jessica.

42:08.341 --> 42:09.209
Sad, girl?

42:10.810 --> 42:13.044
I'm very sorry, okay?

42:13.046 --> 42:14.812
Mission forever,
remember, you said that?

42:14.814 --> 42:15.813
That's right, homeboy.

42:15.815 --> 42:16.915
Jessi forever.

42:16.917 --> 42:18.716
We're gonna find out
what happened here.

42:18.718 --> 42:20.884
Fuckin' eight dead,
eight dead now.

42:20.886 --> 42:21.821
Eight dead.

42:34.835 --> 42:38.636
Is this really necessary
Johnson, you asshole?

42:38.638 --> 42:40.270
Lady's gonna lose her license.

42:40.272 --> 42:41.272
Fucker.

42:41.274 --> 42:42.540
Receiving stolen
city property.

42:42.542 --> 42:46.076
The camera's my own
personal property, a-hole.

42:46.078 --> 42:47.946
You don't know shit, Johnson.

42:47.948 --> 42:51.116
Yeah, well, it's evidence now.

42:51.118 --> 42:52.884
Her license is gone.

42:52.886 --> 42:56.321
We are merely retrieving
what belongs to the city.

42:56.323 --> 43:00.661
Jesus Christ did
you fuck up this time, Morales.

43:02.395 --> 43:03.263
Mm-mm-mm.

43:08.368 --> 43:10.304
See you later, pussy.

43:11.337 --> 43:12.937
I just cost Miss Mary her gig.

43:12.939 --> 43:13.837
Miss Mary, I'm so sorry.

43:15.207 --> 43:17.375
But I had a pretty good idea
who turned the cops on me.

43:27.421 --> 43:28.288
Sophia.

43:30.457 --> 43:31.188
- You double crossed me.
- What are you...

43:31.190 --> 43:32.056
Bitch, you told them!

43:32.058 --> 43:32.857
I didn't tell them anything!

43:32.859 --> 43:34.926
You told them everything!

43:34.928 --> 43:35.493
- I warned you!
- Bullshit!

43:35.495 --> 43:36.795
Yes, I did.

43:36.797 --> 43:38.897
If I double crossed you,
then why would I have this?

43:38.899 --> 43:40.397
It's a list of all
the contributions

43:40.399 --> 43:44.169
to the mayor, the chief
of police, the DA.

43:44.171 --> 43:46.237
It's all in there.

43:46.239 --> 43:47.107
Fuck.

43:49.042 --> 43:50.107
If you didn't tell
'em, how did they know

43:50.109 --> 43:52.109
all my shit was at
Miss Mary's, huh?

43:52.111 --> 43:54.145
My files, my photos, everything?

43:54.147 --> 43:55.346
We're not safe.

43:55.348 --> 43:56.246
That's what's going on here.

43:56.248 --> 43:57.882
We're not safe.

43:57.884 --> 44:00.884
We need to get outta here.

44:00.886 --> 44:03.022
I have an idea, come on.

44:09.830 --> 44:11.699
Fucking going on here.

44:13.265 --> 44:14.667
Son of a bitch.

44:15.736 --> 44:17.134
God damn it.

44:17.136 --> 44:18.236
Are you crazy,
what are you doing?

44:18.238 --> 44:19.937
Yeah, I'm going crazy, Sophia.

44:19.939 --> 44:21.941
I'm fucking crazy, yeah.

44:23.009 --> 44:26.745
The lamp, the goddamn
lamp, I knew it.

44:26.747 --> 44:28.145
Sone of a bitch.

44:28.147 --> 44:30.383
What are you looking for?

44:51.303 --> 44:52.171
Oh my god.

44:53.473 --> 44:55.406
Your motherfucking aunt
recorded every goddamn word

44:55.408 --> 44:56.540
we said last night.

44:56.542 --> 44:57.908
What do you think of
that, hm, counselor?

44:57.910 --> 44:58.643
Everything?

44:58.645 --> 44:59.576
Every goddamn thing.

44:59.578 --> 45:00.310
We gotta get the
fuck outta here.

45:00.312 --> 45:01.645
What, what do I pack?

45:01.647 --> 45:05.549
Your lipsticks and chonies,
and backpack, go, go, go.

45:10.524 --> 45:12.056
I know a cove up Hateno Bay,

45:12.058 --> 45:14.424
a friend of mine
has a motel there.

45:14.426 --> 45:17.929
I think we can hide out
there for a few days.

45:17.931 --> 45:20.265
See how this thing's
gonna play itself out,

45:20.267 --> 45:22.870
we gage the fallout, whatever.

45:24.904 --> 45:26.437
So let's do that.

45:26.439 --> 45:28.906
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sounds good.

45:47.294 --> 45:51.431
Who are these guys
right here, you know these guys?

45:53.065 --> 45:53.897
No.

45:53.899 --> 45:56.033
They look suspicious though.

46:27.901 --> 46:29.100
Are you hit?

46:29.102 --> 46:30.601
Sophia.

46:30.603 --> 46:31.471
Oh my god.

46:32.939 --> 46:33.703
Stay with me.

46:33.705 --> 46:34.705
- Go.
- Stay with me!

46:34.707 --> 46:38.141
- Go.
- Stay with me, stay with me!

46:38.143 --> 46:40.011
I knew in that instant
my life was changing.

46:40.013 --> 46:41.411
Go.

46:41.413 --> 46:43.614
Punctuated by the horrible
sound of guns and the bullets

46:43.616 --> 46:46.350
ripping through Sophia.

46:46.352 --> 46:47.886
The before and after of this day

46:47.888 --> 46:50.924
would scar whatever
life I have left.

46:52.359 --> 46:54.292
I didn't wanna be around
when the cops arrived,

46:54.294 --> 46:55.659
no sir, the way
things were going.

46:55.661 --> 46:59.832
I was convinced they'd try
to pin Sophia's murder on me.

47:01.368 --> 47:05.439
But one day, one day those
who did this will pay.

47:06.973 --> 47:11.109
And I'll be around to see
it, you're fucking-a right.

47:36.035 --> 47:37.101
When I got back to La Mission,

47:37.103 --> 47:39.469
I discovered my loft
had been torched.

47:39.471 --> 47:42.674
Another warning from them,
I guess, the big boys.

47:42.676 --> 47:43.811
Cocksucker!

47:47.681 --> 47:49.948
The graffiti didn't fool me.

47:49.950 --> 47:51.315
Shit.

47:51.317 --> 47:54.384
They would've liked to give
me a little tune up, I guess.

47:54.386 --> 47:57.825
Obviously, I never
went back to the job.

48:19.111 --> 48:22.013
I went underground
for my own protection.

48:22.015 --> 48:26.152
The fix was in, see, my
evidence gone, evaporated.

48:39.265 --> 48:40.498
Chain smoking and cleaning guns

48:40.500 --> 48:42.870
seemed like my best option.

48:47.607 --> 48:49.009
My only option.

48:59.518 --> 49:01.551
Callahan was a big
city hall hero now,

49:01.553 --> 49:04.688
and the big broad came
out on top once again.

49:04.690 --> 49:06.426
Unscathed, bastards.

49:08.761 --> 49:11.295
So dispatching them
to the other barrio

49:11.297 --> 49:14.001
seemed like the only way to go.

49:20.205 --> 49:24.074
Even though taking them all
down would've felt so good,

49:24.076 --> 49:27.712
really it wouldn't have
changed a goddamn thing,

49:27.714 --> 49:29.547
other than landing me
lifetime accommodations

49:29.549 --> 49:32.219
and a nice view of San Quentin,

49:33.319 --> 49:37.288
I couldn't find a way
to bring 'em down,

49:37.290 --> 49:39.558
and I began to lose my grip.

49:41.060 --> 49:44.094
I was falling further and
further down the rabbit hole.

51:30.636 --> 51:33.437
Happy summer solstice!

51:43.649 --> 51:44.949
Hey.

51:44.951 --> 51:47.851
Check it, so I'm gonna
create the perfect interface.

51:47.853 --> 51:51.589
What I do is I set up the
designs in my entire app team,

51:51.591 --> 51:54.859
create the app, order the best
drip coffee in The Mission,

51:54.861 --> 51:56.861
I collect all the royalties,

51:56.863 --> 52:00.230
and my 401K blows the
fuck up and boom, slam,

52:00.232 --> 52:01.565
top of Google.

52:01.567 --> 52:05.236
I never was able
to tell you this, Roberto,

52:05.238 --> 52:07.904
but I killed a man, too.

52:07.906 --> 52:10.942
My fiance and I were coming back

52:10.944 --> 52:14.844
from a weekend of
wine tasting in Napa.

52:14.846 --> 52:17.815
I was driving, a bit tipsy.

52:17.817 --> 52:19.419
Horrible accident.

52:22.221 --> 52:23.089
He died.

52:26.225 --> 52:28.494
My aunt got me off the hook.

52:29.428 --> 52:32.098
From that day on, she owned me.

52:34.667 --> 52:38.270
I had to sell my soul
to stay out of jail.

52:39.839 --> 52:42.339
But how do I get
more gigs on the dropbox?

52:42.341 --> 52:45.743
Just delete your current
dropbox and create an alias.

52:45.745 --> 52:46.613
Right?

52:47.980 --> 52:48.848
Right?

52:52.518 --> 52:54.518
Yo, let's get a picture.

52:54.520 --> 52:55.219
- Yeah.
- Let's get a picture,

52:55.221 --> 52:56.286
let's get a picture.

52:56.288 --> 52:58.022
- Get in, get in.
- You guys ready?

52:58.024 --> 52:59.991
All right, selfie.

52:59.993 --> 53:03.361
We're on a Mexican party
bus in The Mission.

53:03.363 --> 53:05.362
There we go, all right.

53:05.364 --> 53:07.397
You blinked.

53:07.399 --> 53:08.399
I'm gonna Instagram that.

53:08.401 --> 53:11.268
- That's a good one.
- Oh my gosh.

53:11.270 --> 53:12.036
We all look
pretty good in that.

53:12.038 --> 53:13.437
Pretty good.

53:13.439 --> 53:15.005
Do I look good?

53:15.007 --> 53:16.274
Nice, cheers.

53:16.276 --> 53:17.875
Oh, okay.

53:17.877 --> 53:18.544
New guy.

53:20.379 --> 53:21.745
Can I ask you a question?

53:21.747 --> 53:22.615
Yeah.

53:25.285 --> 53:29.321
Do you think that the
stronger, hipper hipsters

53:33.725 --> 53:38.328
are eating the weaker, more
uncool hipsters in The Mission,

53:38.330 --> 53:39.397
just like.

53:40.700 --> 53:43.433
Is there a cannibalism
thing going on?

53:43.435 --> 53:44.467
That's a good question.

53:44.469 --> 53:45.670
You mean, like,
like you mean like,

53:45.672 --> 53:47.538
people having like the
munchies or something?

53:47.540 --> 53:48.672
Sure, yeah.

53:48.674 --> 53:52.710
Or like no, like, I'm
eating your culture.

53:52.712 --> 53:54.444
Like a tortilla.

53:54.446 --> 53:55.515
- Oh!
- What?

53:57.417 --> 54:00.717
Oh, speaking of
tortillas, El Palalito!

54:00.719 --> 54:01.855
El Palalito!

54:02.855 --> 54:04.087
We are going.

54:04.089 --> 54:05.422
And speaking of munchies,
we want some of this.

54:05.424 --> 54:09.627
Smoke that, and then we're
going to get some tacos.

54:09.629 --> 54:11.728
I'll take a hit.

54:11.730 --> 54:13.600
- Oh you, wow.
- Yeah.

54:17.703 --> 54:18.370
Shit.

54:21.873 --> 54:24.674
Yeah, hipsters gone wild.

54:24.676 --> 54:28.814
Don't do that to our new
friend over here.

54:31.616 --> 54:34.919
I think I'll call the cops
and ask them if they know.

54:34.921 --> 54:36.087
What dude?

54:36.089 --> 54:37.120
Wait, no, don't call,
you can't call the cops.

54:37.122 --> 54:39.422
- Wait.
- Wait, dude, are you a cop?

54:39.424 --> 54:41.894
Is this The Mission precinct?

54:42.828 --> 54:44.828
Uh, yeah, nine 11 officer,

54:44.830 --> 54:48.466
I'd like to report a crime
in The Mission district.

54:48.468 --> 54:49.900
A crime of the century.

54:49.902 --> 54:51.000
A high-tech stick up,

54:51.002 --> 54:52.136
and I'm looking at
perpetrators right now.

54:52.138 --> 54:55.004
Very good looking, very
fashionably dressed,

54:55.006 --> 54:57.574
one guy looks like
Weezer, and um...

54:57.576 --> 54:58.442
Whoa, dude.

54:58.444 --> 55:00.377
Two Deathcab for Cutie chicks.

55:00.379 --> 55:02.045
Whatever dude, I'll
take it, I like Weezer.

55:02.047 --> 55:06.150
And I think that they are
cannibalizing The Mission,

55:06.152 --> 55:08.585
and I'd like you to come and um,

55:08.587 --> 55:10.388
put your red lights on
'cause I'm very, very scared.

55:10.390 --> 55:11.688
I'm very scared.

55:11.690 --> 55:12.355
We're just having
a nice time here.

55:12.357 --> 55:13.723
We don't know you.

55:13.725 --> 55:14.891
Dude, so am I.

55:14.893 --> 55:15.960
You done man, you done?

55:15.962 --> 55:17.661
Having a good time, too.

55:17.663 --> 55:18.661
All right, dude.

55:18.663 --> 55:19.795
We're all just
having a good time.

55:19.797 --> 55:21.598
- Let's just chill out, okay?
- All right.

55:21.600 --> 55:22.900
Sorry about that.

55:22.902 --> 55:25.402
We're all very cute and
very cool lookin' people.

55:25.404 --> 55:26.670
- Thanks, dude.
- Okay.

55:26.672 --> 55:28.071
You know, I used to
have to go to Napa Valley

55:28.073 --> 55:30.473
to see white people,

55:30.475 --> 55:32.710
now I just have to go
to 18th and Valencia

55:32.712 --> 55:34.948
and I feel like a minority.

55:36.783 --> 55:37.714
Isn't that weird?

55:37.716 --> 55:39.016
- Is that just me?
- I don't know.

55:39.018 --> 55:41.419
Well, that's kind of the
trajectory of the city.

55:41.421 --> 55:42.752
I think what's
fuckin' weird is your,

55:42.754 --> 55:44.821
why, why are you?

55:44.823 --> 55:45.690
I'm sorry.

55:45.692 --> 55:47.824
- Peace, peace.
- He's sorry.

55:47.826 --> 55:50.594
Okay, I think
just somewhere else.

55:50.596 --> 55:52.562
Am I weirding you,
am I making it weird?

55:52.564 --> 55:54.130
No, you're good man,
we're just gonna leave.

55:54.132 --> 55:56.466
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you know what?

55:56.468 --> 55:58.169
It's a party, to
me, it's a fiesta.

55:58.171 --> 55:59.603
Um, yeah, we'd like
to get off now, I think.

55:59.605 --> 56:00.437
Driver?

56:00.439 --> 56:01.504
Be careful, sweetie.

56:01.506 --> 56:02.306
Yeah, you
have a good night.

56:02.308 --> 56:03.406
A good time to go.

56:03.408 --> 56:05.676
All right, yep,
have a good time, man.

56:05.678 --> 56:06.710
- Asshole.
- Chill the fuck out.

56:06.712 --> 56:09.748
Work on that
41-OK thing you got.

56:10.683 --> 56:11.748
Yeah, I plan on it.

56:11.750 --> 56:13.116
All right, man.

56:13.118 --> 56:15.553
All right,
Nickelback, take care.

56:15.555 --> 56:17.424
Uh yeah, okay.

56:22.727 --> 56:25.995
Hey, whoa.

56:25.997 --> 56:28.933
You really cleared
out the joint.

56:28.935 --> 56:30.402
Congratulations.

56:36.007 --> 56:38.611
You know what I always ponder?

56:39.745 --> 56:42.614
Why do they call 'em
hipsters, anyway?

56:44.216 --> 56:46.485
The Beats, they were hip.

56:48.988 --> 56:51.024
They were non-conformist.

56:52.625 --> 56:56.563
These tech kids nowadays,
they're eager to conform.

56:58.598 --> 56:59.866
These tech kids,

57:00.966 --> 57:04.734
they make and find their
identity on the net.

57:04.736 --> 57:06.569
Are you a fuckin' cop or what?

57:06.571 --> 57:07.737
No.

57:07.739 --> 57:09.038
Then why don't you
go sit somewhere else?

57:09.040 --> 57:12.812
Why don't you pick on
someone your own mental size?

57:14.513 --> 57:15.381
Kiss me.

57:29.794 --> 57:30.794
Hi boys.

57:30.796 --> 57:33.531
Everyone has to
wear the sombreros.

57:33.533 --> 57:34.598
Really?

57:34.600 --> 57:37.503
Sorry man,
rules are rules.

58:01.694 --> 58:03.694
I got some weed
if you sing another.

58:03.696 --> 58:04.828
Down low.

58:15.975 --> 58:16.843
Fuck.

58:25.817 --> 58:27.283
Woman on deck.

58:27.285 --> 58:28.719
Hi, Pearl.

58:28.721 --> 58:29.886
Hi, boys.

58:29.888 --> 58:31.254
Tuna fish and a
ripple of wine, honey.

58:31.256 --> 58:34.958
Exnay on the tuna, but what's
the vintage on the ripple?

58:34.960 --> 58:38.094
Uh, this morning?

58:38.096 --> 58:39.929
Who are you?

58:39.931 --> 58:41.230
That's The Pearl, man.

58:41.232 --> 58:42.866
Exactly, who are you?

58:42.868 --> 58:46.603
Guardian
angel's what she is.

58:46.605 --> 58:47.638
How'd you know about
those fucking men

58:47.640 --> 58:48.938
in that Mexican bus
back there, huh?

58:48.940 --> 58:49.973
Did I help you or not?

58:49.975 --> 58:51.275
Okay, you helped me.

58:51.277 --> 58:52.879
Then you owe me.

58:53.946 --> 58:55.648
Excuse me, fellas.

58:56.781 --> 58:59.016
I owe you nothing,
I owe you what?

58:59.018 --> 59:00.850
Easy, easy.

59:00.852 --> 59:02.853
Pearl is our friend.

59:02.855 --> 59:03.886
It's all right, guys.

59:03.888 --> 59:05.755
Bob's an old friend.

59:05.757 --> 59:07.891
Let's keep the party polite.

59:07.893 --> 59:09.627
You want I should
scalp him, Pearl?

59:09.629 --> 59:10.495
No, no, no, no.

59:10.497 --> 59:12.663
Reinforcing ugly stereotypes

59:12.665 --> 59:14.330
isn't quite necessary
tonight, Mr. Crow,

59:14.332 --> 59:16.634
but thank you just the same.

59:16.636 --> 59:17.900
Just let me know, eh?

59:17.902 --> 59:20.004
Scalping, you say?

59:20.006 --> 59:22.306
I counted coup
on a hundred fools.

59:22.308 --> 59:24.274
He's still scalping 'em.

59:24.276 --> 59:25.475
It's in the hat.

59:25.477 --> 59:28.145
Urban buff and soldierin'
is what we call it.

59:28.147 --> 59:29.413
Oh.

59:29.415 --> 59:31.382
She brings us fancy
yuppie food every week, man.

59:31.384 --> 59:33.850
We got to protect her, brother.

59:33.852 --> 59:35.752
Oh, you damn right.

59:35.754 --> 59:36.920
How'd she know my name?

59:36.922 --> 59:38.525
Go get her, man!

59:41.993 --> 59:44.027
Hey, Pearl!

59:44.029 --> 59:46.663
That Pearl's a
shape-shifter man.

59:46.665 --> 59:48.665
You got that right, she is.

59:48.667 --> 59:50.199
She's gonna
bring me a yoga mat

59:50.201 --> 59:51.868
so I can do Bikram down here.

59:51.870 --> 59:54.203
- Shit.
- Oh, aristocrat.

01:00:45.256 --> 01:00:46.723
Well most of you
probably already know

01:00:46.725 --> 01:00:48.759
why we're here
tonight, but welcome,

01:00:48.761 --> 01:00:49.993
for those of you who don't know,

01:00:49.995 --> 01:00:53.096
welcome to the Just Cause
Causa Justa meeting.

01:00:53.098 --> 01:00:54.397
Why are we here?

01:00:54.399 --> 01:00:56.833
Because we are
justified in our cause.

01:00:56.835 --> 01:00:58.502
They keep evicting us from
our places where we live,

01:00:58.504 --> 01:01:01.071
the elders, the young people,

01:01:01.073 --> 01:01:04.174
and now even these businesses.

01:01:04.176 --> 01:01:05.542
Fact I, just walkin' up here,

01:01:05.544 --> 01:01:07.877
somebody handed me the flyer
for the Encantada Gallery.

01:01:07.879 --> 01:01:08.978
They're even being
displaced themselves.

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.448
So that's why we're
here tonight, folks,

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.317
'cause we wanna hear from you.

01:01:13.319 --> 01:01:15.252
We wanna take your
voices and your stories

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:17.920
straight to the people who
really need to hear 'em,

01:01:17.922 --> 01:01:19.857
down at City Hall.

01:01:19.859 --> 01:01:22.091
So who has a problem?

01:01:22.093 --> 01:01:23.259
Earnestine?

01:01:23.261 --> 01:01:25.328
Yes, well, I came here
today looking for help

01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:28.531
because, um, everybody in
our building got notices

01:01:28.533 --> 01:01:29.900
that we have to move.

01:01:29.902 --> 01:01:32.034
We have nine apartments, and
we're all being displaced,

01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:35.071
and one family only
has found a place.

01:01:35.073 --> 01:01:36.105
I, myself have an issue.

01:01:36.107 --> 01:01:38.040
I have my 90 year
old mother with me,

01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:40.310
and I have not been
able to find a place.

01:01:40.312 --> 01:01:42.411
I'm down to 15 days.

01:01:42.413 --> 01:01:43.913
I filed an elder abuse report

01:01:43.915 --> 01:01:46.049
because I think
it is elder abuse.

01:01:46.051 --> 01:01:48.786
My mother has lived here all
her life, in The Mission.

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:51.187
She does not wanna
leave The Mission.

01:01:51.189 --> 01:01:52.556
I don't wanna leave The Mission.

01:01:52.558 --> 01:01:55.792
I raised my children here,
why is this happening to us?

01:01:55.794 --> 01:01:57.261
How are they getting
away with this?

01:01:57.263 --> 01:01:59.495
We cannot find an
affordable place.

01:01:59.497 --> 01:02:01.031
I need help with this.

01:02:01.033 --> 01:02:02.332
I was just hoping that today,

01:02:02.334 --> 01:02:05.101
maybe somebody could go
through my resources with me

01:02:05.103 --> 01:02:06.502
and see if there's
anything I've missed

01:02:06.504 --> 01:02:08.272
because I don't know what to do.

01:02:08.274 --> 01:02:09.607
Where do I turn?

01:02:09.609 --> 01:02:12.042
When we get to the end of
this road, where do we turn?

01:02:16.415 --> 01:02:17.480
You can do that?

01:02:17.482 --> 01:02:19.082
Totally within the
color of the law.

01:02:19.084 --> 01:02:20.516
You're a badass.

01:02:20.518 --> 01:02:21.819
I know, right?

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:22.953
Available units,

01:02:22.955 --> 01:02:25.522
see deputies at 600
block of Valpo Avenue.

01:02:25.524 --> 01:02:27.391
Africans American female
refusing to vacate premises.

01:02:27.393 --> 01:02:30.027
God damn it, another
tenant just got scammed.

01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:34.167
Has chained
herself to the front gate.

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:35.968
What?

01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:41.205
Welcome.

01:02:41.207 --> 01:02:41.873
Welcome?

01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:46.109
Outstanding work, Pearl.

01:02:46.111 --> 01:02:47.844
Found him faster
than I thought.

01:02:47.846 --> 01:02:48.747
Found me?

01:02:52.116 --> 01:02:53.984
Who are you people?

01:02:53.986 --> 01:02:55.054
Who are we?

01:02:56.154 --> 01:02:56.853
You hungry, man?

01:02:56.855 --> 01:02:58.589
You want a sandwich?

01:02:58.591 --> 01:03:01.991
Or an $11 mission burrito
from Fisherman's Wharf?

01:03:01.993 --> 01:03:03.993
Who's the smart-ass white boy?

01:03:03.995 --> 01:03:05.895
The white boy is
a housing attorney

01:03:05.897 --> 01:03:09.132
specializing in renters' rights
for Section Eight tenants

01:03:09.134 --> 01:03:12.034
and class action lawsuits
against developers

01:03:12.036 --> 01:03:15.105
who prey upon and
discriminate against the poor.

01:03:15.107 --> 01:03:17.375
That's who the white boy is.

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:19.275
He's pretty good.

01:03:19.277 --> 01:03:21.310
Pretty sick court record, too.

01:03:21.312 --> 01:03:23.446
Don't fuck with
with the white boy.

01:03:23.448 --> 01:03:25.050
I'll try not to.

01:03:27.051 --> 01:03:28.284
What do yo guys do here?

01:03:28.286 --> 01:03:30.087
Fuck shit up.

01:03:30.089 --> 01:03:32.288
We hack systems, track people.

01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:33.792
You're hackers.

01:03:35.261 --> 01:03:36.893
You're tracking me?

01:03:36.895 --> 01:03:38.328
Yes.

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:39.596
Why me, why?

01:03:39.598 --> 01:03:40.630
Why you, shit.

01:03:40.632 --> 01:03:43.433
You're Bob Morales, mano.

01:03:43.435 --> 01:03:45.167
We'll work with you
to nail the bastards.

01:03:45.169 --> 01:03:46.402
To torched hotels to make room

01:03:46.404 --> 01:03:48.605
for million-dollar lofts.

01:03:48.607 --> 01:03:49.605
The real enemy.

01:03:49.607 --> 01:03:52.544
You guys are
cute, but I'm uh...

01:03:54.379 --> 01:03:55.545
Underground?

01:03:55.547 --> 01:03:58.415
Yes, and I've been
down this road before.

01:03:58.417 --> 01:03:59.815
Which road is that, sir?

01:03:59.817 --> 01:04:01.051
The road of developers, the
road of millions of dollars.

01:04:01.053 --> 01:04:04.187
The road of smoke in
mirrors and bureaucracies

01:04:04.189 --> 01:04:06.022
and where nothing sticks.

01:04:06.024 --> 01:04:07.893
Shit don't stick, man.

01:04:08.993 --> 01:04:11.929
Where people get torched
in their SRO rooms.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:13.199
They burn alive.

01:04:16.634 --> 01:04:18.236
Seven people dead.

01:04:24.209 --> 01:04:26.976
I couldn't prove
a fuckin' thing.

01:04:26.978 --> 01:04:30.480
Maybe you couldn't,
but we could try.

01:04:30.482 --> 01:04:32.716
Bob, why don't you
allow us to wire you

01:04:32.718 --> 01:04:35.217
with a microcamera
or a microphone

01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:38.587
and we'll post your raw
opinion of your mission.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.158
Dispatches from
the underground.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.028
Wire me?

01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:45.495
I don't do wires, ever.

01:04:45.497 --> 01:04:46.629
Not a wire, wire.

01:04:46.631 --> 01:04:48.332
Just a way for us to
capture your narrative.

01:04:48.334 --> 01:04:49.199
My narrative.

01:04:49.201 --> 01:04:51.634
Oh, are you guys fuckin' crazy?

01:04:51.636 --> 01:04:54.437
Are you out of your mind?

01:04:54.439 --> 01:04:56.073
I still don't know
how you guys know me

01:04:56.075 --> 01:04:57.877
or who the hell I am.

01:04:58.977 --> 01:05:00.676
You're
like my hero, Morales.

01:05:00.678 --> 01:05:03.950
But I'm hella
underground now, son.

01:05:05.984 --> 01:05:09.252
I'm not trying to be seen
by you, by you, or by you.

01:05:09.254 --> 01:05:12.288
But we can still see you.

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:14.093
I see Chicano people.

01:05:16.761 --> 01:05:18.761
This place is
beyond fucking weird.

01:05:18.763 --> 01:05:21.297
You wanna know
what's even weirder, Bob?

01:05:21.299 --> 01:05:21.998
Christopher.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.033
What's even weirder

01:05:24.035 --> 01:05:28.105
is that you were once
a pure badass once.

01:05:28.107 --> 01:05:30.140
You got close to the fire,
and you allowed the man

01:05:30.142 --> 01:05:33.009
to push you underground
where you could sleep

01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:35.578
under a railroad track.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:36.513
That's enough, Christopher.

01:05:36.515 --> 01:05:37.382
No, no.

01:05:38.484 --> 01:05:40.016
Let him go.

01:05:40.018 --> 01:05:41.551
Keep going, white boy.

01:05:41.553 --> 01:05:43.319
Developers don't sleep.

01:05:43.321 --> 01:05:44.420
Money doesn't sleep.

01:05:44.422 --> 01:05:47.156
Evictions do not
sleep, motherfucker.

01:05:47.158 --> 01:05:48.792
Here The Mission gave you...

01:05:48.794 --> 01:05:50.060
Dog paths.

01:05:50.062 --> 01:05:51.060
Cultural tourism.

01:05:51.062 --> 01:05:53.029
Mills Act, anybody?

01:05:53.031 --> 01:05:55.431
We were once a
city of poets, man.

01:05:55.433 --> 01:05:59.136
Underground underworld
is real cool, Roberto,

01:05:59.138 --> 01:06:00.804
but at this point,
it's a luxury,

01:06:00.806 --> 01:06:04.074
and the hipsters, they don't
even know you were underground

01:06:04.076 --> 01:06:07.044
because they barely
even acknowledged

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:09.015
your fucking existence.

01:06:16.654 --> 01:06:17.989
That's cold.

01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:24.261
Bob Morales is not in
the other barrio just yet.

01:06:24.263 --> 01:06:25.694
There's work to do.

01:06:28.801 --> 01:06:30.634
Looking for
a mission in Bernal Heights.

01:06:35.473 --> 01:06:36.272
Fuck, stop.

01:06:36.274 --> 01:06:37.507
No, it never stops, Bob.

01:06:40.245 --> 01:06:43.114
- Not in Williamsburg.
- Brooklyn.

01:06:44.248 --> 01:06:46.216
Not in Silver
Lake or Echo Park.

01:06:48.219 --> 01:06:50.152
- Chinatown.
- Tampoco.

01:06:50.154 --> 01:06:53.089
And it won't stop while
you heal or seek closure

01:06:53.091 --> 01:06:53.992
for Sophia.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.094
Or the seven souls in
a Mission hotel fire.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.631
Urban deportation.

01:07:00.265 --> 01:07:01.563
Swift moving current, ese.

01:07:01.565 --> 01:07:04.234
Scarcely slowing even
for the suns and daughters

01:07:04.236 --> 01:07:06.703
of technology to
disembark their buses.

01:07:06.705 --> 01:07:08.040
White buses.

01:07:11.609 --> 01:07:14.643
The nightly flotilla of
Google, Facebook, Yahoo salmon

01:07:14.645 --> 01:07:16.612
swimming up Valencia.

01:07:16.614 --> 01:07:19.649
The Nina, the Pinta,
the Santa Maria.

01:07:19.651 --> 01:07:23.719
Kids wanna live in
edgy, cool, hip hoods

01:07:23.721 --> 01:07:27.723
without the actual hassle
of homeless people,

01:07:27.725 --> 01:07:30.662
the working poor,
the undocumented,

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:35.067
or god forbid, a
real fag with HIV.

01:07:40.872 --> 01:07:42.207
That's good.

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:46.408
That's pretty good.

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:48.013
For a white boy.

01:07:48.814 --> 01:07:50.016
All right.

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:54.750
I'm gonna hit the head.

01:07:59.424 --> 01:08:01.027
Okay, that's good.

01:08:07.765 --> 01:08:08.632
We got him.

01:08:08.634 --> 01:08:09.833
You think?

01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:11.237
I don't know.

01:09:13.898 --> 01:09:16.732
Everyone has a divine
right to Saturday night.

01:09:16.734 --> 01:09:20.872
Divine, divine.

01:09:25.777 --> 01:09:30.116
The queen of 16th street.

01:09:31.416 --> 01:09:35.484
A true gentlemen never
guesses a woman's age,

01:09:35.487 --> 01:09:37.252
where a woman's from.

01:09:37.255 --> 01:09:39.388
Are you a true gentleman?

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:43.495
Divina was walking down
the street to Esta Noche,

01:09:44.795 --> 01:09:47.296
looking for her divine
right to a Saturday night

01:09:47.299 --> 01:09:49.531
but she never made it.

01:09:49.533 --> 01:09:53.671
Divina has a whole group of
fierce blessings of unicorn

01:09:54.973 --> 01:09:57.440
that are watching,
looking out for her.

01:09:57.442 --> 01:09:59.609
Somewhere in the beyond.

01:09:59.611 --> 01:10:03.748
Divina.

01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:09.052
This is for you, Jessica.

01:10:09.054 --> 01:10:11.320
You rest in peace.

01:10:17.328 --> 01:10:19.829
It is my absolute honor
to introduce to you

01:10:19.831 --> 01:10:23.801
the bard of The Mission
the keeper of the fire,

01:10:25.437 --> 01:10:27.404
Alejandro Murguia,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:31.676 --> 01:10:35.445
Thank you all very much

01:10:35.447 --> 01:10:36.980
for showing up tonight.

01:10:36.982 --> 01:10:40.749
I'm Alejandro Murguia,
and I'm from The Mission,

01:10:40.751 --> 01:10:43.919
and I'm on a mission
like you're on a mission,

01:10:43.921 --> 01:10:45.021
and we are on a mission,

01:10:45.023 --> 01:10:48.857
and the mission is
to be in the mission.

01:10:52.831 --> 01:10:56.368
Wherever I stand, here,
there, everywhere,

01:10:57.469 --> 01:11:00.469
I'm in The Mission, and
The Mission's in me,

01:11:00.471 --> 01:11:03.839
like The Mission's in you
because The Mission is

01:11:03.841 --> 01:11:07.710
to be in the Mission,
(speaks in foreign language)?

01:11:07.712 --> 01:11:11.849
Spectators, operators, speculators,
all roam in The Mission,

01:11:13.385 --> 01:11:17.454
but there's some people in
this scene from La Mission.

01:11:17.456 --> 01:11:21.024
Watch your watch

01:11:21.026 --> 01:11:23.026
when you're in The Mission.

01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:25.661
Check the descarga
beat on Mission Street

01:11:25.663 --> 01:11:29.798
because the heat is
on The Mission, yeah.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.369
That's right, so the new mission

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:35.440
must be to free the
mission, oh yeah.

01:11:37.108 --> 01:11:40.509
Hear me straight, cats and
kitties, that's the vision,

01:11:40.511 --> 01:11:43.681
and what a vision,
to free The Mission.

01:11:44.849 --> 01:11:48.118
That's the mission,
free The Mission, ho.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.085
Thank you all.

01:11:50.087 --> 01:11:53.155
Thank you all very much.

01:12:16.514 --> 01:12:19.082
And so I was thinking that
maybe we could get some...

01:12:50.514 --> 01:12:51.382
Sir!

01:12:53.984 --> 01:12:55.688
This belongs to you.

01:12:59.858 --> 01:13:01.825
Uh, I'll catch you
in a second, okay?

01:13:01.827 --> 01:13:03.362
- You sure?
- Yes.

01:13:05.897 --> 01:13:09.434
No, this is what you've
been looking for.

01:13:16.608 --> 01:13:19.345
We used to be a city of poets.

01:13:20.612 --> 01:13:21.846
We still are.

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:24.350
Be cool.

01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:26.652
I used to be you.

01:14:07.058 --> 01:14:08.761
I used to be you.

01:14:50.301 --> 01:14:52.235
Happy summer solstice, eh?

01:14:52.237 --> 01:14:54.270
Thank you, Mr. Crow.

01:14:57.576 --> 01:15:00.179
♪ Local hipsters ♪

01:15:22.934 --> 01:15:24.667
The first power
of folks we encounter

01:15:24.669 --> 01:15:27.736
in Planet Mission
is a border conflict

01:15:27.738 --> 01:15:31.876
between the so-called
locals and the art hipsters.

01:15:33.912 --> 01:15:38.748
Two gross generalizations cause

01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:39.682
the locals aren't that local

01:15:39.684 --> 01:15:42.688
and the hipsters
aren't that hip.

01:15:45.156 --> 01:15:46.489
The main complaint of the locals

01:15:46.491 --> 01:15:50.392
is that the hipsters don't
really live in The Mission,

01:15:50.394 --> 01:15:52.962
ontologically speaking.

01:15:52.964 --> 01:15:54.463
That they are here temporarily

01:15:54.465 --> 01:15:58.737
only to have a vicarious
experience of bohemian otherness.

01:16:01.773 --> 01:16:03.972
They are perceived
as obnoxious tourists

01:16:03.974 --> 01:16:05.274
scratching the hood

01:16:05.276 --> 01:16:09.846
'cause it's closer than San
Miguel Allende or Oaxaca,

01:16:09.848 --> 01:16:13.182
cheaper than Santa
Fe or Venice Beach,

01:16:13.184 --> 01:16:16.785
and certainly less
dangerous than Tijuana.

01:16:16.787 --> 01:16:19.922
And after a few
Grey Goose martinis,

01:16:19.924 --> 01:16:22.127
the hipsters also complain.

01:16:23.761 --> 01:16:25.794
They complain about
the homeboys, machismo,

01:16:25.796 --> 01:16:28.065
and their primitive tattoos.

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:33.302
About the homegirls'
rowdiness and long black nails

01:16:33.304 --> 01:16:36.705
and moan that everything
closes so early

01:16:36.707 --> 01:16:38.943
in the mecca of hipsterism.

01:16:47.786 --> 01:16:50.085
It's a complicated border war.

01:16:50.087 --> 01:16:54.824
On the surface, it's a war
between boom boxes and iPods,

01:16:54.826 --> 01:16:58.296
between tequila and
more expensive tequila.

01:17:00.165 --> 01:17:03.165
But deep inside, it's
a much nastier war

01:17:03.167 --> 01:17:07.171
between those who remember
and those who forget.

01:17:08.105 --> 01:17:10.138
Those who are here to stay

01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:13.578
and those who are
just passing through.

01:17:21.385 --> 01:17:23.953
Last night, one
of my local bars,

01:17:23.955 --> 01:17:27.390
this old Chicano drunk
whispered into my ear

01:17:27.392 --> 01:17:31.326
as if consoling
himself, in two years,

01:17:31.328 --> 01:17:35.731
all these wanna-be eccentrics
will all return to Iowa

01:17:35.733 --> 01:17:39.670
or Wisconsin, wherever
the fuck they came from.

01:17:45.309 --> 01:17:47.912
It's a complicated border war.

01:18:05.964 --> 01:18:08.030
It's a good read.

01:18:08.032 --> 01:18:10.031
I was riveted.

01:18:10.033 --> 01:18:12.235
I miss a good book.

01:18:12.237 --> 01:18:15.841
Oh-ho.

01:18:19.042 --> 01:18:22.311
Why you come down here, man?

01:18:22.313 --> 01:18:24.213
Why do you come around here?

01:18:24.215 --> 01:18:26.883
He comes here to remember.

01:18:26.885 --> 01:18:27.549
- Remember what?
- He remembers.

01:18:27.551 --> 01:18:29.220
We remember, too.

01:18:32.055 --> 01:18:32.922
You were
here that night.

01:18:32.924 --> 01:18:34.222
What night?

01:18:34.224 --> 01:18:36.359
Come on, brother.

01:18:36.361 --> 01:18:37.959
What are you
talkin' about, what night?

01:18:37.961 --> 01:18:39.296
I remember you.

01:18:40.398 --> 01:18:43.365
The night your buddies
started a bad fire

01:18:43.367 --> 01:18:45.236
just right over there.

01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:49.806
The night Hobo Harry died.

01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:52.174
Burned to death right there.

01:18:52.176 --> 01:18:54.145
They torched Hobo Harry.

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.215
Guys, I had, I.

01:19:01.419 --> 01:19:04.587
Fellas, I had nothing
to do with that.

01:19:04.589 --> 01:19:08.193
But you tried to
stop it, as I remember.

01:19:10.194 --> 01:19:12.829
Sons of bitches
sprayed Hobo Harry

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:16.598
with that damn lighter fluid
all over his mattress, too.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.601
He was beggin' 'em to stop.

01:19:18.603 --> 01:19:20.468
Mean little fuckers.

01:19:22.005 --> 01:19:24.406
He was screamin'
to make 'em stop.

01:19:26.411 --> 01:19:27.946
I was, I tried.

01:19:32.250 --> 01:19:35.317
Flames been followin' me
my whole fuckin' life.

01:19:35.319 --> 01:19:37.587
Maybe it's time
to stop running.

01:19:37.589 --> 01:19:39.989
Running from the flame.

01:19:39.991 --> 01:19:42.057
Not all fire's bad.

01:19:42.059 --> 01:19:44.995
Not all brimstone
is bad, you know?

01:19:45.897 --> 01:19:48.300
Turn and face the fire, Bob.

01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:51.433
Could be you're
holdin' the flamethrower

01:19:51.435 --> 01:19:53.201
in your hand right now.

01:19:53.203 --> 01:19:57.341
We all of us have
matches.

01:19:59.410 --> 01:20:01.212
Fire's chased us all.

01:20:02.313 --> 01:20:04.750
Oh, tobacco for the fire.

01:20:06.584 --> 01:20:09.017
Gartland Hotel, 1976.

01:20:09.019 --> 01:20:09.985
'75.

01:20:09.987 --> 01:20:10.855
- '75.
- Ah.

01:20:12.322 --> 01:20:16.026
And it was the Gartland
Apartments, yeah.

01:20:17.428 --> 01:20:19.296
I lived there, I know.

01:20:20.465 --> 01:20:23.298
Had myself a real
nice room there.

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:26.902
Hot plate in the corner,
black and white TV,

01:20:26.904 --> 01:20:31.173
little Frigidaire.

01:20:32.410 --> 01:20:33.642
Aristocrat.

01:20:33.644 --> 01:20:36.311
Oh, touche, my brother Crow.

01:20:36.313 --> 01:20:38.013
Things was flush for you.

01:20:38.015 --> 01:20:40.152
'Till the Gartland fire.

01:20:42.185 --> 01:20:44.255
12 souls up and perished.

01:20:45.422 --> 01:20:48.425
We're homeless, but
we're not stupid.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:54.329
A little advice, go on and
get the fuck up outta here.

01:20:54.331 --> 01:20:55.630
Yes.

01:20:55.632 --> 01:20:57.566
Suit up, Bob.

01:20:57.568 --> 01:20:59.468
Get your ass back out there.

01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:00.472
In the game.

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:04.573
You're not built so
well for down here.

01:21:04.575 --> 01:21:05.307
No, sir.

01:21:05.309 --> 01:21:06.475
For I too have walked

01:21:06.477 --> 01:21:09.611
in the shadow of the
valley of the silicon.

01:21:09.613 --> 01:21:12.981
This ain't no
weather underground.

01:21:12.983 --> 01:21:16.086
This ain't no
social media, either.

01:21:19.023 --> 01:21:22.223
Revolt of the
cockroach people.

01:21:22.225 --> 01:21:25.962
Your poet is giving
you a shot at redemption.

01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:28.063
Fuckin-a right, eh?

01:21:28.065 --> 01:21:29.432
Right.

01:21:29.434 --> 01:21:32.267
Mission still
needs you, Morales.

01:21:32.269 --> 01:21:34.704
So bang your drum slowly.

01:21:34.706 --> 01:21:37.442
Let it haunt the Colonial ghosts

01:21:39.143 --> 01:21:42.013
in the banks of
The Mission Creek.

01:21:44.282 --> 01:21:45.647
I like that.

01:21:45.649 --> 01:21:49.552
Besides, you ain't ready
for the big other barrio yet.

01:21:49.554 --> 01:21:52.722
You're a fuckin'
housing authority.

01:21:52.724 --> 01:21:55.391
Housing investigator
man, actually.

01:21:55.393 --> 01:21:58.093
Well go on and
do your thing, boo.

01:21:58.095 --> 01:22:01.629
Praise the lord and
pass the ripple.

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:23.718
Wire me up, white boy.

01:22:27.657 --> 01:22:28.723
Take your shirt off.

01:22:28.725 --> 01:22:30.191
Actually, I have
something better.

01:22:30.193 --> 01:22:34.298
What's better than a half-naked
Latino man with a wire?

01:22:36.634 --> 01:22:40.171
This.

01:22:42.572 --> 01:22:43.440
Whoa.

01:22:45.343 --> 01:22:46.808
Go make a Wiki page

01:22:46.810 --> 01:22:48.744
or whatever it is
the fuck you guys do.

01:22:48.746 --> 01:22:51.246
I always wondered what
a WikiLeak looked like.

01:22:51.248 --> 01:22:53.048
That's it
right there, man.

01:22:53.050 --> 01:22:54.749
Go Wiki, go get a hashtag.

01:22:54.751 --> 01:22:57.253
- Good.
- Yeah, man.

01:22:57.255 --> 01:22:58.286
Go, Wiki baby.

01:22:58.288 --> 01:23:00.289
No, no,
no, no, no Wiki.

01:23:00.291 --> 01:23:01.557
No?

01:23:01.559 --> 01:23:04.125
No, we take this
to The Observer.

01:23:04.127 --> 01:23:07.062
Nobody reads newspapers
anymore, Pearl.

01:23:07.064 --> 01:23:08.164
I do.

01:23:08.166 --> 01:23:09.365
Old schooling.

01:23:09.367 --> 01:23:11.534
She's the shock collar, eh?

01:23:11.536 --> 01:23:13.602
This might be the bang-bang
play we've been waiting for.

01:23:13.604 --> 01:23:15.704
Well, if something's gonna
happen, let it happen now.

01:23:15.706 --> 01:23:18.043
This is good, real good.

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:21.413
Read this, Sean, read that.

01:23:23.113 --> 01:23:27.415
Now check this out.

01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:28.651
Handwritten, even.

01:23:28.653 --> 01:23:31.454
Following the tragic
death of my niece, Sophia,

01:23:31.456 --> 01:23:34.289
my health has
deteriorated rapidly.

01:23:34.291 --> 01:23:36.459
God is punishing me, I believe,

01:23:36.461 --> 01:23:38.227
and to receive his forgiveness,

01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:41.097
I must release our
no-show contracts

01:23:41.099 --> 01:23:45.534
and every ghost transaction
regarding the hotel fires.

01:23:45.536 --> 01:23:46.604
May God forgive.

01:23:48.171 --> 01:23:50.438
All hail the queen and
the deathbed confession.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.107
- Yeah.
- Get your smoking gun

01:23:52.109 --> 01:23:54.110
and smoking ammunition.

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:55.343
How did you get this?

01:23:55.345 --> 01:23:57.112
From El Poeta himself.

01:23:57.114 --> 01:23:57.981
Where did he get it?

01:23:57.983 --> 01:24:01.150
From Sophia's aunt.

01:24:01.152 --> 01:24:03.384
They were lovers, call
it the crazy '80s.

01:24:03.386 --> 01:24:04.520
Is there a...

01:24:04.522 --> 01:24:05.687
Turn it over.

01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:07.123
A love
letter to confirm this?

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:08.257
Read, read.

01:24:08.259 --> 01:24:09.792
Says right here.

01:24:13.397 --> 01:24:15.798
So, Poeta was the
only one she trusted.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.801
And El Poeta trusted Bob?

01:24:18.803 --> 01:24:21.402
'Cause this vato
is super legit.

01:24:21.404 --> 01:24:24.807
Fuck a plea baragin,
these are iron-clad docs.

01:24:24.809 --> 01:24:26.174
They'll stand up to a jury.

01:24:26.176 --> 01:24:28.179
Dates, ledgers, fires.

01:24:30.747 --> 01:24:31.847
Huh?

01:24:31.849 --> 01:24:35.453
We are holding more
fire for the fire.

01:24:36.386 --> 01:24:37.287
Sean, go.

01:24:38.622 --> 01:24:40.556
Shit, gone!

01:24:40.558 --> 01:24:41.626
Be careful.

01:24:49.466 --> 01:24:53.168
I started feeling
better about myself again,

01:24:53.170 --> 01:24:54.536
and for the first time,

01:24:54.538 --> 01:24:58.108
I was able to return to the
spot Sophia was gunned down.

01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:03.181
I'm not gonna lie to
you, it was hard, man.

01:25:04.247 --> 01:25:05.116
Real hard.

01:25:06.282 --> 01:25:09.485
But I had to say goodbye
to her one last time.

01:25:09.487 --> 01:25:13.188
Say thank you to
her, one last time.

01:25:15.693 --> 01:25:19.494
My only consolation was that
Callahan was all over the news.

01:25:19.496 --> 01:25:20.829
Hew as on the run
like a scared rat

01:25:20.831 --> 01:25:25.433
fleeing a sinking ship, and
he was about to be nailed.

01:25:57.234 --> 01:25:59.767
This mural right here started
out as sort of a symbol.

01:25:59.769 --> 01:26:02.471
A reminder so we
wouldn't forget,

01:26:02.473 --> 01:26:06.611
but it ended up helping
inspire an entire movement.

01:26:10.413 --> 01:26:13.651
And that movement
took over the barrio.

01:26:16.854 --> 01:26:17.518
Who's city?

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.620
Our city!

01:26:18.622 --> 01:26:19.288
Who's city?

01:26:19.290 --> 01:26:20.388
Our city!

01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:21.289
Who's city?

01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:22.658
Our city!

01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:26.797
Viva La Mission!

01:26:29.966 --> 01:26:31.667
Our
mission no eviction!

01:26:33.737 --> 01:26:35.603
Our mission no eviction!

01:26:37.875 --> 01:26:39.674
Our mission now eviction!

01:26:42.045 --> 01:26:43.945
Our mission no eviction!

01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:48.017
Our mission no eviction!

01:26:49.886 --> 01:26:52.454
I gotta be real
honest with you.

01:26:52.456 --> 01:26:56.560
It felt so good to finally
land one of the big fish.

01:26:58.328 --> 01:27:00.963
Would it bring back
all the souls we lost?

01:27:00.965 --> 01:27:01.833
No.

01:27:03.166 --> 01:27:07.035
But Callahan, he won't be
killing for money anymore.

01:27:07.037 --> 01:27:10.308
Man, sweet.

01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:16.978
Nicole, be sure to
get Discolandia, okay?

01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.379
How's this?

01:27:18.381 --> 01:27:19.414
Perfect.

01:27:19.416 --> 01:27:20.348
Hola.

01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:21.553
Hola.

01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:28.457
There are a thousand
stories in the city.

01:27:28.459 --> 01:27:31.326
But only seven souls who
perished in a hotel fire

01:27:31.328 --> 01:27:34.599
not so long ago, I
will not forget them.

01:27:36.634 --> 01:27:38.033
Hey, mind if I take a photo
and put it on Instagram?

01:27:38.035 --> 01:27:39.267
Sure.

01:27:39.269 --> 01:27:41.337
Nor will I forget
Sophia and Jessica,

01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:42.905
my two angels.

01:27:42.907 --> 01:27:43.775
Thanks.

01:27:44.608 --> 01:27:47.109
This to you, I swear.

01:27:47.111 --> 01:27:51.448
I only hope they made it
safely to the other side.

01:27:52.916 --> 01:27:54.883
To the other barrio.
