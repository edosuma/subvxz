sort of gay?

10:04.691 --> 10:07.084
Why didn't he ever
tell me that?

10:07.128 --> 10:09.434
Probably because he didn't
want you having sex with her.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.480

10:11.523 --> 10:14.091

wanted to say that...

You and dad had your Cubs games
and your chess matches.

33:05.548 --> 33:07.028
And you got all that stuff!

33:07.072 --> 33:10.379
He gave you the season tickets,
his chess set.

33:10.423 --> 33:14.905
All I had with him, literally,
all I ever had with him,

33:14.949 --> 33:16.907
was these newspapers,

33:16.951 --> 33:20.520
and he still gave them to you!

33:20.563 --> 33:22.696
Okay, fine, whatever, take them.

33:22.739 --> 33:25.220
No.
I-I don't want

33:25.264 --> 33:30.834
you to give them to me, Lesley.
I wanted Dad to give them to me.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.490
And you know what
the really sad part is?

33:34.534 --> 33:37.276
I actually thought that he did.

33:37.319 --> 33:38.886
[chuckles]

33:38.929 --> 33:42.281
Like, I actually believed that,
for once in my life,

33:42.324 --> 33:44.979
someone chose me.

33:45.762 --> 33:47.634
But...

33:49.244 --> 33:51.725
...of course he didn't.
[laughs]

33:51.768 --> 33:55.250
'Cause no one chooses me.

33:59.385 --> 34:00.951
[door closes]

34:00.995 --> 34:02.649
Haven't heard one of your
dramatic breakdowns

34:02.692 --> 34:04.346
since high school.

34:04.390 --> 34:06.305
Really miss it.

34:23.844 --> 34:25.411
[sniffles]

34:27.369 --> 34:29.415
[exhales]

34:33.636 --> 34:37.901
MURPHY:You know, I really appreciate
you, uh, sticking around.

34:39.338 --> 34:40.687
No problem.

34:40.730 --> 34:42.645
I know there's still
no service, and Jess

34:42.689 --> 34:44.691
probably didn't call me.

34:44.734 --> 34:47.041
This whole thing
was stupid, but...

34:47.868 --> 34:50.088
...you never made me
feel like it was.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.527
[laughs]

34:54.570 --> 34:56.964
Oh, is this funny to you?Yes,

34:57.007 --> 34:59.836
actually.
Extremely.

34:59.880 --> 35:03.492
Your, um... your phone?

35:03.536 --> 35:04.667
What?

35:04.711 --> 35:06.365
It was in my pocket.

35:08.236 --> 35:09.498
You're joking.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.065
I-I thought it was mine.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.241
[laughs]

35:13.285 --> 35:14.721
Where's yours?

35:14.764 --> 35:17.289
I mean, it's probably
in the car, 'cause I'm an idiot.

35:17.332 --> 35:18.551
Are you kidding me?

35:18.594 --> 35:20.118
[chuckles]Oh, my God.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.861
Oh, uh...

35:24.905 --> 35:26.515
[moans]

35:26.559 --> 35:28.778
Did I have any missed calls?

35:30.693 --> 35:32.217
Still no service.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.392
No?

35:33.435 --> 35:35.307
No.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.178
Oh, my God.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.962
Give me my phone. Give me...Come here.

35:39.006 --> 35:40.355
Are you serious?

35:49.147 --> 35:53.063
I got to go check on Felix.
He's, uh, fragile.

35:53.107 --> 35:55.240
Yeah, what's going on
with you guys?

35:55.283 --> 35:58.939
Nothing. We did it once.
It-it was stupid.

35:59.766 --> 36:02.290
Um, I'll be back in a bit.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.253
How long has it been?

36:09.079 --> 36:11.212
How long has it been?

36:14.737 --> 36:17.044
[knocking on door]

36:18.611 --> 36:21.962
I'm sleeping.

36:22.005 --> 36:23.964
No, you're not.

36:27.576 --> 36:30.449
Found my phone, by the way.

36:31.493 --> 36:33.756
Oh, yeah?

36:33.800 --> 36:35.932
Where was it?

36:36.759 --> 36:38.239
Uh, it was just...

36:38.283 --> 36:42.112
buried in a bunch of pillows
and cushions and stuff.

36:42.156 --> 36:44.419
What are you doing?Just, uh...

36:44.463 --> 36:46.813
figured I'd make use
of these old newspapers

36:46.856 --> 36:48.554
while the Internet's out.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.338
Maybe see if there's anything
about Jennifer Walker.

36:50.382 --> 36:53.646
I know around when
she disappeared, so...

36:53.689 --> 36:55.430
Did you find anything?

36:55.474 --> 36:57.171
Not yet.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.390
Hmm.

37:03.308 --> 37:07.312
I r-I really don't know that
this is gonna lead us to Jess.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.662
I do.

37:09.705 --> 37:12.534
I just have a feeling.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.455
[exhales]

37:23.719 --> 37:27.332
I'm really sorry about what
happened in the bathroom.

37:29.769 --> 37:33.990
I'm sort of tapped out on,
uh, humiliation for one night,

37:34.034 --> 37:36.993
so if could just
talk about anything else?

37:37.037 --> 37:38.995
Yeah. Sure.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.562
Thank you.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.528
Tell me about your newspapers.

37:55.534 --> 37:57.840
My dad's office

37:57.884 --> 38:00.495
was just newspapers.
[laughs softly]

38:00.539 --> 38:02.149
It was just stacks
of newspapers.

38:02.192 --> 38:03.977
Like, you couldn't even
move around, it was just

38:04.020 --> 38:05.848
thousands of newspapers.

38:05.892 --> 38:07.720
Wow.Anyway,

38:07.763 --> 38:10.331
so, when I was a kid,

38:10.375 --> 38:13.334
he would let me sit in there
as long as I stayed quiet.

38:13.378 --> 38:16.032
So I would read
and read and read.

38:16.076 --> 38:17.382
[chuckles]

38:17.425 --> 38:21.516
And, uh, yeah, I probably read

38:21.560 --> 38:24.214
every newspaper cover to cover
from the time

38:24.258 --> 38:26.521
I was five years old,
which is why I know so much,

38:26.565 --> 38:30.220
But there's a dark side
to knowing that much.

38:30.264 --> 38:33.311
Because, uh, you know,
reading, like,

38:33.354 --> 38:36.052
about the Tajikistani Civil War

38:36.096 --> 38:37.576
as a second grader?[laughs]

38:37.619 --> 38:39.229
Very scarring.

38:41.449 --> 38:44.539
But the point is...

38:44.583 --> 38:46.889
it was our thing.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.239
You know?

38:51.459 --> 38:54.506
I mean, I thought
it was our thing.

38:54.549 --> 38:59.032
I-I guess it didn't really
mean anything to him.

38:59.075 --> 39:01.208
He just...

39:01.251 --> 39:04.994
gave it to his perfect Lesley.

39:07.562 --> 39:10.435
That sucks, Felix.
I'm sorry.

39:10.478 --> 39:12.480
It's okay.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.744
Just so you know,

39:15.788 --> 39:19.313
your dad might have thought
Lesley is perfect,

39:19.357 --> 39:23.578
but I think she sucks.

39:24.797 --> 39:27.060
You're just saying that
because she's boning Max.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.410
No, she's a horrible person.

39:29.454 --> 39:32.065
She's, like...

39:32.108 --> 39:33.806
arrogant and smug.

39:33.849 --> 39:36.939
She's like all the bad parts
of you without any of the good.

39:36.983 --> 39:38.724
Thank you.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.769
I'm serious. What
was that out there?

39:40.813 --> 39:43.598
She's like... she's like,
"Do you control everybody?"

39:43.642 --> 39:45.948
Get... G-Go away.
You don't even...

39:45.992 --> 39:48.690
You just met me.
What do you know?

39:48.734 --> 39:51.737
[chuckles] I mean,
she's always been like that.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.391
She thinks she knows
everything about everyone.

39:53.434 --> 39:54.653
I mean, when we were kids,

39:54.696 --> 39:56.742
she would tell me
about these issues I had.

39:56.785 --> 39:58.221
And I'm like, "Actually, no.

39:58.265 --> 39:59.919
I have issues
because of you, bitch."

39:59.962 --> 40:02.008
Because of you.
Like, and then,

40:02.051 --> 40:03.139
can she complain
any more...

40:03.183 --> 40:05.403

What were you saying?Huh. Look at that.
