00:00.634 --> 00:01.467
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Ah, the Grateful Dead...</i>

00:01.469 --> 00:05.337
<i> They were the chillest</i>
<i> jam band of the '80s,</i>
<i> and wherever they went,</i>

00:05.339 --> 00:06.805
<i> their die-hard fans</i>
<i> would follow them.</i>

00:06.807 --> 00:10.042
<i> Back then, every school</i>
<i> had the token Deadhead.</i>

00:10.044 --> 00:11.744
<i> Ours was Matt Bradley.</i>

00:11.746 --> 00:14.380
<i> ¶ I will get by ¶</i>

00:14.382 --> 00:15.914
So talented.
So chill.

00:15.916 --> 00:16.915
I will get by.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.417
JTP!
ALL: JTP!

00:18.419 --> 00:19.051
Where you guys been?

00:19.053 --> 00:22.054
I was at the Wawa,
feeding that stray dog pizza.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.322
You missed out big-time.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.157
He loves pineapples,
like a person.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.392
I told you, bro!
Hilarious.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.493
I eat those,
and I'm a person.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.994
Come on. Let's go
spit off a bridge.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.863
Actually, I think
we'd rather just chill here

00:30.865 --> 00:31.964
and watch
Matt Bradley jam.

00:31.966 --> 00:34.266
That guy?
He's a stupid Deadhead.

00:34.268 --> 00:34.867
So?
So?

00:34.869 --> 00:37.169
Their songs are, like,
a million hours long,

00:37.171 --> 00:39.471
their crazy fans
smell like armpits,

00:39.473 --> 00:40.672
and all they wear
is tie-dye.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.841
It's like, pick a color, bro.
You can't have them all.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.878
Look past the
swirly colors, man.
Matt Bradley's a good egg.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.546
We should totally make him
a member of the JTP.

00:47.548 --> 00:53.118
No way! It's in
our official bylaws that
any potential JTP prospect

00:53.120 --> 00:54.853
has to bring something
new to the group.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.355
Dude, he's, like,
a chick magnet.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.756
We already got one, me!

00:57.758 --> 00:58.957
He's also,
like, super-chill.

00:58.959 --> 01:02.961
I'm super-chill!
I will physically hurt
your face right now!

01:02.963 --> 01:04.396
At the very least,
he's musical.

01:04.398 --> 01:07.266
You want music?
Watch and learn.

01:07.268 --> 01:11.770
Attention, adoring fans.
Big Tasty is in the house!

01:11.772 --> 01:12.704
You suck!

01:12.706 --> 01:15.107
That's right! I do rock.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.141
JTP, drop a beat.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.610
Um, Bar, history has proven
that you say two good lines

01:18.612 --> 01:22.214
and then you freeze u
p and just repeat them
over and over...

01:22.216 --> 01:24.550
I said "Drop a beat"!

01:24.919 --> 01:26.819
(BEATBOXING)

01:26.821 --> 01:29.254
(RAPPING)
<i> ¶ Check to the one</i>
<i> and check to the two</i>

01:29.256 --> 01:30.923
<i> ¶ Big Tasty's on the mic,</i>
<i> rappin' at you</i>

01:30.925 --> 01:33.892
<i> ¶ 'Cause I'm checkin'</i>
<i> to the one and</i>
<i> I'm checkin' to the two</i>

01:33.894 --> 01:36.328
<i> ¶ Big Tasty's on the mic,</i>
<i> rappin' for you</i>

01:36.330 --> 01:38.464
<i> ¶ Checkity one</i>
<i> and checkity two</i>

01:38.466 --> 01:39.131
He's stuck
in a loop again.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.933
<i> ¶ And I'm rappin'</i>
<i> and I'm rappin'</i>
<i> and I'm rappin' at you ¶</i>

01:40.935 --> 01:45.270
(CROWD BOOS)
And he's gonna get hit
in the face in three, two...

01:45.272 --> 01:46.705
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:46.707 --> 01:50.409
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:53.147 --> 01:54.113
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

01:54.115 --> 01:58.217
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

01:58.752 --> 02:00.686
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was</i>
<i> March 8th, 1980-something,</i>

02:00.688 --> 02:04.323
<i> and I was doing what I did</i>
<i> best, being awesome.</i>

02:04.325 --> 02:06.925
(AS ROBOCOP) Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.160
All right,
my little Robo-Schmoop,

02:08.162 --> 02:10.796
time to clean up
your masterpiece
so I can lay out mine.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.132
(NORMAL VOICE) But we're about
to shoot Pops' big scene.

02:13.134 --> 02:16.635
Adam, is that you?
I can't see in this thing!

02:16.637 --> 02:17.603
Just take five, Pops.

02:17.605 --> 02:21.173
Finally! I'm shvitzing
in this big box!

02:21.175 --> 02:25.410
<i> What happened next</i>
<i> would change my life forever.</i>

02:26.614 --> 02:29.448
(SLO-MO) Oh...

02:29.450 --> 02:32.117
Fudge!

02:32.119 --> 02:33.519
<i> Only, I didn't say "Fudge."</i>

02:33.521 --> 02:37.523
<i> I said the big one,</i>
<i> the granddaddy of bad words,</i>

02:37.525 --> 02:39.858
<i> and it was not good.</i>

02:41.529 --> 02:42.294
Hey!

02:42.296 --> 02:43.195
You don't even want to know

02:43.197 --> 02:44.897
what this little
muddy mouth just said.

02:44.899 --> 02:47.499
You only get one helping
of shrimp Parm tonight.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.968
You can have seconds
on cheesy garlic bread,

02:49.970 --> 02:50.869
but no thirds!

02:50.871 --> 02:52.571
It was an accident,
okay?

02:52.573 --> 02:53.138
Unacceptable!

02:53.140 --> 02:56.341
I mean, where did you
even learn such a potty word?

02:56.343 --> 02:57.576
Nowhere.
Answer me!

02:57.578 --> 02:59.678
Who taught you
how to do this stuff?

02:59.680 --> 03:00.679
You, all right?

03:00.681 --> 03:03.482
I learned it
by watching you!

03:04.185 --> 03:05.951
Wha... What?

03:05.953 --> 03:07.486
I have never!

03:07.488 --> 03:08.253
Seriously?

03:08.255 --> 03:09.821
What? I don't talk like that.

03:09.823 --> 03:10.589
ADULT ADAM:<i> But she did.</i>

03:10.591 --> 03:13.358
<i> Bev Bombs were dropped</i>
<i> on a daily basis in our home.</i>

03:13.360 --> 03:15.260
Holy (BLEEP)!
I love that idea!

03:15.262 --> 03:17.095
I hate drugs
so (BLEEP) much!

03:17.097 --> 03:20.666
Adam used to be a good boy,
and now he's a real (BLEEP).

03:20.668 --> 03:22.868
(BLEEPING)

03:25.272 --> 03:27.072
(BLEEPING CONTINUES)

03:27.074 --> 03:27.439
Yeah!

03:27.441 --> 03:30.809
Okay, maybe I do get saucy
once in a blue moon,

03:30.811 --> 03:32.277
but I can
because I'm an adult.

03:32.279 --> 03:35.314
An adult who can't
stop herself from
talking like a lumberjack.

03:35.316 --> 03:38.317
Oh, really? Well,
we'll see about that.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.686
I'm starting
a swear jar.

03:40.955 --> 03:41.420
My pickles!

03:41.422 --> 03:43.755
You do realize
that jar is way too small
for you, right?

03:43.757 --> 03:46.391
Oh, you'll see. I'm not gonna
drop a penny into this thing.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.894
Oh, well, then you won't
mind if we use it
for something awesome,

03:48.896 --> 03:51.096
like, I don't know,
a trip to the Bahamas.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.197
Or even more exciting...

03:52.199 --> 03:54.266
A trip to Colonial
Williamsburg!

03:54.268 --> 03:56.635
We can finally get
a picture in the stocks!

03:56.637 --> 03:58.770
You already have one!

03:59.240 --> 04:00.839
But I want a new one.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.108
Oh. Thou doth look
so snuggly. (GIGGLES)

04:03.110 --> 04:05.577
No more old-timey trips
where we learn stuff.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.545
I want to tan
in the Bahamas.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.981
No one's going to the Bahamas.
No one's going anywhere.

04:08.983 --> 04:10.716
Of course not.
And you know why?

04:10.718 --> 04:12.451
Because my lips
are squeaky-clean.

04:12.453 --> 04:17.322
Yay! Making my kids
better people is
gonna be (BLEEP) fun.

04:17.324 --> 04:18.323
¶¶

04:18.325 --> 04:19.992
Yo, dude,
we've been talking,

04:19.994 --> 04:21.426
and we want to make
an official vote

04:21.428 --> 04:23.061
to induct Matt Bradley
into the JTP.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.229
We already decided.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.365
He brings nothing new
to the table.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.633
Bro, he's got a snake.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.535
A streamlined iguana?
For real?

04:30.537 --> 04:32.070
A deal's a deal.
He's JTP-worthy.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.840
Fine! We take a vote
and never discuss it again.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.476
All those in favor
in accepting Matt Bradley

04:37.478 --> 04:39.845
as a member of the JTP,
say "Aye."

04:39.847 --> 04:41.947
ALL: Aye.
Those opposed? Me.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.349
And as we all know,
I'm the leader,

04:44.351 --> 04:46.151
so my vote counts
as three.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.086
And what does that mean?
ALL: Tie vote.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.821
And what happens
in the event of a tie vote?

04:49.823 --> 04:53.258
ALL: You win.
Democracy in action!
Let's go.

04:53.260 --> 04:56.495
Yo, JTP,
you meet Snake Plissken?

04:56.497 --> 04:57.996
He poisonous?
Nah.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.431
He's a boa, super-docile.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.167
Lame.
Oh, I was gonna see
if you wanted to hold it.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.135
Oh, yeah!
I mean... No.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.971
We took a vote.
We reject you and
your awesome viper.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.306
That's not what
the vote was for.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.874
It was to be a member
of the JTP.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.242
Wow. I would be honored.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.678
Don't be. You've
already been rejected.

05:12.680 --> 05:13.145
It was a landslide.

05:13.147 --> 05:16.348
Come on, Bar. At least
give him a chance to take
the membership test.

05:16.350 --> 05:16.782
Membership test?

05:16.784 --> 05:19.651
It's a series of riddles,
trivia, and feats of strength.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.687
Sounds rad.
Fine!

05:21.822 --> 05:23.121
I'll give you a shot.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.524
But, as our charter states,
once you fail,

05:25.526 --> 05:26.892
you can't ever be
one of us.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.894
You don't mess around
in the JTP.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.362
ALL: JTP!
No!

05:30.364 --> 05:31.897
He's not a member!

05:31.899 --> 05:34.566
No call and response, JTP.

05:34.568 --> 05:34.900
ALL: JTP.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.803
ADULT ADAM:<i> As Matt Bradley</i>
<i> was learning</i>
<i> the rules of the JTP,</i>

05:37.805 --> 05:39.838
<i> my mom was setting up</i>
<i> her own rules.</i>

05:39.840 --> 05:42.841
The rules are simple,
You curse, you reimburse.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.677
One dollar for every swear
sworn in this household.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.412
Well, I, for one, think
this is a fantastic way

05:47.414 --> 05:48.847
to make us the very best
people that we can be.

05:48.849 --> 05:52.084
And go to the Bahamas
and pierce my belly button.
Forget I said that.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.618
No one's going
to the damn Bahamas.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.487
Bup-bup! That's a dollar
in the swear jar, Dad.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.489
She's right, Murray.
We have to live by example.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.058
I'm not paying for these
morons to go to the Bahamas.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.294
You know, "moron" may not be
considered a curse word,

06:02.296 --> 06:04.863
but it really does feel
like one emotionally.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.531
I'll put 20 bucks
in that thing

06:06.533 --> 06:09.968
if I can call any moron
who's acting like a moron

06:09.970 --> 06:12.070
a moron anytime I want.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.638
50.
Worth it.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.039
Morons!

06:14.041 --> 06:16.475
You know what would teach us
a super-valuable lesson?

06:16.477 --> 06:19.878
Upping the fee for
the big-time swears
to 5 bucks a pop.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.980
Yes! Ooh!
What a great idea.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.982
Oh, balls!
It's really not!

06:23.984 --> 06:25.584
(LAUGHS) That's $5!

06:25.586 --> 06:28.220
For "balls"?
But it has
so many meanings,

06:28.222 --> 06:30.088
only one of which
refers to one's nards.

06:30.090 --> 06:34.393
That's $10!
Yay! My babies
are gonna be angels!

06:35.229 --> 06:36.795
What have you done,
dragon lady?

06:36.797 --> 06:40.365
I've got $7 to my name.
I'm already in debt.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.700
Relax. I have a plan.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.469
When it comes to swearing,
we have self-control.

06:44.471 --> 06:45.937
Lucky for us,
our mom does not.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.141
Oh, my God. You're gonna
use the swear jar to scam Mom.

06:49.143 --> 06:52.711
I ran the numbers.
We need 723 big swear words.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.679
If we can up Mom's swear rate
to twice an hour

06:54.681 --> 06:57.149
and nail her on some "hells"
and "damn its" in between,

06:57.151 --> 06:59.584
we're gonna be slurping
on strawberry daiquiris

06:59.586 --> 07:01.553
in the Bahamas
in 13 days.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.288
How do we get her
to swear more?

07:03.290 --> 07:04.990
Follow my lead.

07:04.992 --> 07:05.757
Hey, Mom?

07:05.759 --> 07:08.093
I've been thinking
about it, and...

07:08.095 --> 07:09.795
You're more than a mom.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.197
You're also, like...
A friend.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.732
That's exactly how I feel!

07:13.734 --> 07:16.334
We're like best
(BLEEP) friends!

07:16.336 --> 07:17.803
Oh. Wow.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.204
While I appreciate
the enthusiasm,

07:19.206 --> 07:21.740
you kind of just dropped
a big-money word.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.141
That'll be a fiver.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.042
Did I say "(BLEEP)"?

07:24.044 --> 07:27.679
I said it again! Oh!
How many (BLEEP) was that?

07:27.681 --> 07:28.146
(SIGHS)

07:28.148 --> 07:29.448
Oh, (BLEEP) it.
I'll just put in a $20.

07:29.450 --> 07:33.185
It's money well-spent
for my delicious,
talented superstar!

07:33.187 --> 07:37.122
Mama! I'm cold, and
nothing can keep me
warm like your hug!

07:37.124 --> 07:40.926
Will you hug me till I'm all
roasty and toasty inside?

07:40.928 --> 07:42.093
(BLEEP)

07:42.095 --> 07:45.263
(LAUGHING)
You are so adorable!

07:45.265 --> 07:46.765
(GASPS)

07:48.202 --> 07:50.001
I'll get my purse.

07:50.003 --> 07:50.969
(CHUCKLES)

07:50.971 --> 07:53.104
ADULT ADAM:<i> As we bankrolled</i>

07:53.106 --> 07:55.841
<i> my brother was banking</i>
<i> on Matt Bradley failing</i>

07:55.843 --> 07:58.343
<i> the impossible</i>
<i> JTP entrance exam.</i>

07:58.345 --> 08:01.480
Let the trials of
the JTP begin.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.380
ALL: JTP!

08:02.382 --> 08:03.615
First up, Smashball.

08:03.617 --> 08:07.018
Let's see you hit
my unhittable knuckle melon.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.286
¶¶

08:08.288 --> 08:12.757
Yes!
<i> But he destroyed that melon,</i>
<i> and every other challenge.</i>

08:12.759 --> 08:13.458
Slushie chug.

08:13.460 --> 08:16.695
No mere mortal can
ingest an extra-large...

08:16.697 --> 08:18.797
Done! Aah! My head!

08:18.799 --> 08:20.499
But worth it!
Dang!

08:20.501 --> 08:22.534
He's unstoppable!
He's immortal.

08:22.536 --> 08:23.535
Riddles and trivia.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.136
A body is found
in a locked room...

08:25.138 --> 08:26.872
Is the weapon
an ice knife?

08:26.874 --> 08:27.672
Damn it!!

08:27.674 --> 08:29.541
Next category,
busting balls.

08:29.543 --> 08:32.310
Come up with three insults
for how short Andy is.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.446
Oh. No, we don't
have to do...

08:34.448 --> 08:35.647
Go!
Andy's so tiny,

08:35.649 --> 08:37.082
he uses a sock
as a sleeping bag.

08:37.084 --> 08:40.151
When Andy plays mini-golf,
it's just called "Golf."

08:40.153 --> 08:40.785
Did you hear Andy died?

08:40.787 --> 08:44.122
He was bungee-jumping
off a curb and
the dental floss broke.

08:44.124 --> 08:44.956
Ohh!
Ohh!

08:44.958 --> 08:47.058
I feel
completely humiliated.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.059
This guy's awesome!

08:48.061 --> 08:51.530
Blindfolded Rubik's Cube,
which no human can do,

08:51.532 --> 08:53.231
which means you'll
never be one of us.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.300
Go!
Bro, this isn't
in the charter.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.335
The charter
is a living document,

08:57.337 --> 09:00.438
and, lucky for me, it makes it
so he'll never be able to...

09:00.440 --> 09:01.640
Done!
What?

09:01.642 --> 09:02.807
That's awesome!

09:02.809 --> 09:05.710
Dude! Am I in the JTP?
ALL: JTP!

09:05.712 --> 09:07.045
That means "yes." Cool!

09:07.047 --> 09:08.113
So, what are we doing
this weekend?

09:08.115 --> 09:09.514
Well, I don't know
what you'll be doing,

09:09.516 --> 09:12.417
but the O.G. JTP
will be seeing the Fat Boys.

09:12.419 --> 09:13.985
I'd invite you,
but it's sold out.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.053
Why don't we
go see the Dead?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.688
They're playing
at the fairgrounds.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.622
Easy, new guy.

09:17.624 --> 09:20.659
The JTP likes their music
in rap form or not at all.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.994
Actually, I wouldn't mind
switching it up a bit.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.896
Shut up, you tiny, little...

09:24.898 --> 09:27.799
Pocket... Man... Face...

09:27.801 --> 09:28.633
Damn it, that's hard.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.502
That's a big thumbs-up
on the Dead, Matty.

09:30.504 --> 09:32.404
Wait. Barry,
don't you own a van?

09:32.406 --> 09:34.606
We could turn it
into a Dead bus.
Yes!

09:34.608 --> 09:35.540
For sure!
A van-bus!

09:35.542 --> 09:38.743
No! That's our A-Team van
we're taking to the Fat Boys!

09:38.745 --> 09:41.012
And, like all other
JTP decisions,

09:41.014 --> 09:43.415
we're putting this
concert to a vote.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.217
Who wants to see
the Fat Boys tomorrow?

09:46.219 --> 09:47.852
That's three votes
for Fat Bays.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.254
Why do you count
as three?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.355
'Cause don't question it.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.556
Now, how many of you
want to go see

09:51.558 --> 09:53.825
that weird, lame thing
I don't want to do?

09:53.827 --> 09:56.027
One, two, three...

09:57.431 --> 09:58.363
Four?

09:58.365 --> 09:59.664
Grateful Dead, it is.

09:59.666 --> 10:00.999
You're gonna love it,
JTP.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.335
ALL: (CHANTING)
JTP! JTP! JTP!

10:03.337 --> 10:05.437
(CHANTING CONTINUES)
They have four votes.

10:05.439 --> 10:08.773
I'll never get to bulldoze
my closest friends again!

10:08.775 --> 10:10.442
This is a nightmare!

10:11.845 --> 10:15.547
ADULT ADAM:<i> It had been</i>
<i> a week, and my mom's</i>
<i> little swearing problem</i>

10:15.549 --> 10:16.982
<i> had gone from bad to worse.</i>

10:16.984 --> 10:18.750
What'd you say now?
Nothing.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.218
What, did Erica
get another solo?

10:20.220 --> 10:24.222
No. Adam wrote
"Adam hearts Mama"
on his Trapper Keeper.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.591
I had no choice.
He hearts me.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.026
Damn it!
I am slowly paying

10:28.028 --> 10:30.295
for a trip to the Bahamas
that I don't want to take.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.898
I hate to be that person,
but you said "Damn it."

10:33.900 --> 10:34.532
That's a buck.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.568
Don't you see
what the kids
are doing to you?

10:36.570 --> 10:38.603
They're using your
dirty mouth against you.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.804
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was at that moment</i>

10:39.806 --> 10:42.807
<i> that my mom finally realized</i>
<i> she was being played.</i>

10:42.809 --> 10:45.243
Oh, my God!
They're fleecing me!

10:45.245 --> 10:48.580
It's time I teach them
a real lesson.

10:49.082 --> 10:49.981
I've been thinking,
Schmoops.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.885
This jar has been so effective
at stopping my potty mouth,

10:53.887 --> 10:55.820
I figured everyone
should have a jar.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.155
I don't know what
your angle is here,

10:57.157 --> 10:59.991
but I'm gonna have to
say... Phbt! Pass.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.193
Oh, sweetie, such attitude.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.496
Luckily,
now we have this.

11:05.098 --> 11:05.730
Dollar, please.

11:05.732 --> 11:08.900
A "Baditude" jar?
That's not a thing.
Oh, it is.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.403
Every time you lip off,
it'll cost you a dollar.

11:11.405 --> 11:13.004
Well, that's
incredibly stupid!

11:13.006 --> 11:15.807
(GASPS) Baditude!
Now it's $2.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.942
Just stop giving them
baditude!

11:17.944 --> 11:19.344
I don't know how not to!

11:19.346 --> 11:21.079
This isn't fair!
What about him?

11:21.081 --> 11:23.415
Don't worry.
Got you covered.

11:23.417 --> 11:24.015
An "Adam" jar?

11:24.017 --> 11:25.784
You pay up any time
you say any weird stuff

11:25.786 --> 11:28.520
about space or robits
or space robits.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.722
So the Adam jar
is just a nerd jar?

11:30.724 --> 11:31.923
Yeah.
That's very hurtful!

11:31.925 --> 11:35.126
Hey, your<i> Robit-Cop</i> movie
started this whole mess.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.561
RoboCop isn't a robot.

11:36.563 --> 11:37.762
If anything,
he's a cyborg,

11:37.764 --> 11:39.864
which falls under
the umbrella of android,

11:39.866 --> 11:40.865
which means
I'll put in a dollar.

11:40.867 --> 11:44.102
See? We're all just
using these jars to
become better people.

11:44.104 --> 11:48.206
By the end, I'll curse less,
Erica will be
a ray of sunshine,

11:48.208 --> 11:50.508
and Adam will be more...
Accessible.

11:50.510 --> 11:51.609
But we don't have
that kind of money.

11:51.611 --> 11:54.646
Unless you have some
way for us to steal
fractions of a penny

11:54.648 --> 11:57.982
off every bank transaction,
a la<i> Superman III.</i>

11:57.984 --> 11:58.917
Dollar.
Just stop talking!

11:58.919 --> 12:02.821
I can't! It's like the Nothing
in the<i> NeverEnding Story.</i>

12:02.823 --> 12:04.055
It can't be stopped!

12:04.057 --> 12:04.923
Dollar.
Just don't speak!

12:04.925 --> 12:08.359
I'm like Indy when he drank
the black blood of the Kali.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.428
I can't help myself!
Dollar.

12:10.430 --> 12:10.762
Don't worry.

12:10.764 --> 12:14.532
We'll just take money
from my swear jar
and put it into yours.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.667
The proceeds
from your jars

12:15.669 --> 12:18.470
will go towards a trip
to Colonial Williamsburg!

12:18.472 --> 12:19.637
You think you'll beat us?

12:19.639 --> 12:21.005
Well,
I'll be an utter delight,

12:21.007 --> 12:23.041
and Adam won't even be
a little bit nerdy.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.810
Yeah! I'll be as cool
as the ice planet Hoth.

12:25.812 --> 12:26.778
$5.
Just stop talking!

12:26.780 --> 12:30.582
ADULT ADAM:<i> And so we were</i>
<i> forced to avoid</i>
<i> being our usual selves.</i>

12:30.584 --> 12:32.083
<i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> Pops was watching TV</i>

12:32.085 --> 12:35.253
<i> as Barry forced himself</i>
<i> to like the Grateful Dead.</i>

12:35.255 --> 12:36.721
(GROANS)
Stupid Grateful Dead.

12:36.723 --> 12:40.725
I've been listening
to a bass guitar solo
for 20 minutes.

12:40.727 --> 12:41.593
That's a lot of bass.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.996
Everyone knows no song
can be longer than 10 minutes

12:44.998 --> 12:45.997
unless it's
The Sugar Hill Gang.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.601
I know what'll make you feel
better.<i> What's Happening!!</i>

12:49.603 --> 12:50.235
And I told you...

12:50.237 --> 12:52.437
This kid Matt Bradley
is trying to take my place

12:52.439 --> 12:54.739
as supreme and almighty
leader of the JTP.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.242
No, I'm saying
<i> What's Happening!!</i>

12:57.244 --> 12:59.043
I'm losing my posse!

12:59.045 --> 13:00.411
How are you
not getting this?

13:00.413 --> 13:03.515
I get it! I mean...
<i> What's Happening!!</i>

13:03.517 --> 13:06.184
I told you
what's happening 10 times!

13:06.186 --> 13:08.686
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Much like my mom,</i>
<i> who tended to swear,</i>

13:08.688 --> 13:09.821
<i> this is what</i>
<i> Pops usually said.</i>

13:09.823 --> 13:11.856
What's happening?
What's happening?

13:11.858 --> 13:13.625
What's happening?
What's happening?

13:13.627 --> 13:15.093
What's happening?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.095
What's happening?

13:17.097 --> 13:20.131
Oh!<i> What's Happening!!</i>

13:20.133 --> 13:22.233
I love Rerun
on these reruns.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.501
This is a classic.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.903
Rerun tries
to bootleg a show,

13:24.905 --> 13:28.039
and then the Doobie Brothers
stop an entire concert

13:28.041 --> 13:29.707
when they see Rerun
taping them.

13:29.709 --> 13:30.775
Thanks for ruining it.

13:30.777 --> 13:33.444
Wait a minute.
He ruined the concert.

13:33.446 --> 13:33.945
That's it!

13:33.947 --> 13:36.147
I'll record the Dead concert
and get caught.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.818
I'm gonna really
ask this time...
What's happening?

13:39.820 --> 13:41.219
I'll tell you
what's happening.

13:41.221 --> 13:46.057
I'm gonna make sure
the JTP never see
a Dead show again.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.625
¶¶

13:47.627 --> 13:48.626
Oh, there you are.

13:48.628 --> 13:51.262
Erica, do me a favor
and empty the dishwasher.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.630
I would love
to do that, Mother.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.333
So nice of you.
Also, clean the gutters.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.868
What?
Hold it together.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.236
Fun... That would be.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.239
ADULT ADAM:<i> My mom</i>
<i> was playing us</i>
<i> just like we played her,</i>

14:01.241 --> 14:02.774
<i> and then she pulled out</i>
<i> the big guns.</i>

14:02.776 --> 14:05.877
I heard there's a new
<i> Star Track</i> movie coming out.

14:05.879 --> 14:09.347
We should go see it, huh?
Go see<i> Star Track?</i>

14:09.349 --> 14:11.583
That is...
A title you would say.

14:11.585 --> 14:14.118
And I heard the best thing
about the space movie

14:14.120 --> 14:17.622
is this one superhero
named Hans Olo.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.124
Run, Adam! Run!
No! I got to say it.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.460
His name is Han Solo,
not Hans.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.830
He's a rogue smuggler,
not a Danish shoe cobbler.

14:25.832 --> 14:26.631
You boned us.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.468
Han Solo is from<i> Star Wars,</i>

14:30.470 --> 14:31.603
not<i> Star Trek.</i>

14:31.605 --> 14:34.405
And it's<i> Trek,</i> by the way,
not "Track"!

14:34.407 --> 14:36.374
Colonial Williamsburg,
here we come!

14:36.376 --> 14:39.510
Oh, you're gonna look so cute
with your (BLEEP) musket.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.178
Aha!
You swore!

14:40.180 --> 14:43.448
I knew that she wouldn't
last long. So predictable.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.015
Baditude!

14:44.017 --> 14:46.050
Huh! Someone can't keep
their (BLEEP) together.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.886
Ha! Who can't
keep it together now?

14:47.888 --> 14:51.322
This is more twists and turns
than the Battle of Endor!

14:51.324 --> 14:52.123
Adam jar!

14:52.125 --> 14:54.425
Stop talking,
you giant nerd!

14:54.427 --> 14:55.093
Baditude jar!

14:55.095 --> 14:57.028
(CHUCKLES) This is
too (BLEEP) easy.

14:57.030 --> 14:57.762
BOTH: Swear jar!

14:57.764 --> 14:59.764
ADULT ADAM:<i> With that,</i>
<i> the jar wars were on.</i>

14:59.766 --> 15:02.967
<i> Meanwhile, it was</i>
<i> all peace and love</i>
<i> at The Grateful Dead show.</i>

15:02.969 --> 15:05.370
Dude, this 45-minute song
is amazing.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.070
And everyone's
so nice.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.473
Yeah, especially
that one guy that invited
me to live with him

15:08.475 --> 15:11.209
and those 10 other guys over
there on that patch of lawn.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.243
Hey, wouldn't
it be awesome

15:12.245 --> 15:14.979
if we could listen
to this concert later?

15:15.649 --> 15:16.281
What's all that?

15:16.283 --> 15:18.516
Definitely not
illegal bootleg equipment

15:18.518 --> 15:21.386
that'll allow me to profit
after selling them later!

15:21.388 --> 15:23.354
Hey, pal, you trying
to tape the show?

15:23.356 --> 15:25.690
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh!

15:25.692 --> 15:26.691
We're gonna
have to go, huh?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.960
For sure. Taping section's
way over there.

15:28.962 --> 15:29.727
You can go on down.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.962
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Unfortunately for my brother,</i>

15:30.964 --> 15:33.698
<i> he picked the one band</i>
<i> chill enough</i>
<i> to let you tape them.</i>

15:33.700 --> 15:35.900
Barry, you're the man.
You just scored us
better seats.

15:35.902 --> 15:39.904
Why? What kind of band
allows you to tape
their entire concert?

15:39.906 --> 15:40.705
This doesn't make any sense.

15:40.707 --> 15:44.042
Dead are a band of the people.
Music's for everyone.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.176
They're so nice.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.511
Now I hate them even more!

15:46.513 --> 15:47.812
They were supposed to
kick us out!

15:47.814 --> 15:50.548
Whoa. So, you wanted
to ruin this for us?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.717
I mean, not ruin.
I was just...

15:52.719 --> 15:53.251
Not cool, bro.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.921
Yeah, man. You're, like,
a bad friend to the JTP.

15:56.923 --> 15:57.789
ALL: JTP.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.757
Hey! I started this posse.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.360
Without me,
there is no JTP.

16:03.563 --> 16:04.729
You didn't say "JTP" back.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.531
Matt is right.
You're a selfish friend.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.467
Yeah, and if that's how
you want to run the JTP,

16:09.469 --> 16:11.436
then we don't want you in it.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.403
Fine. I don't care.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.406
I'll start a better,
more badass
posse without you.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.408
See you around,
Tasty.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.678
¶¶

16:25.885 --> 16:28.720
ADULT ADAM:<i> Since my brother</i>
<i> lost control of the JTP,</i>

16:28.722 --> 16:31.689
<i> he decided to assemble</i>
<i> a better crew... He hoped.</i>

16:31.691 --> 16:35.059
Okay, welcome to my all-new
and improved posse.

16:35.061 --> 16:37.261
I'm Big Tasty,
founder and leader.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.330
First order of business,
we need a name.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.499
How about Rush?
How about hush?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.601
No Rush, no Atkins.

16:44.104 --> 16:44.569
Later.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.538
Okay, so, our name has to
have "Jenkintown" in it.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.641
I was thinking
the Jenkintown Awesome Group.

16:50.643 --> 16:51.943
Wait, you want us
to be the JAGs?

16:51.945 --> 16:55.346
(IN RUSSIAN ACCENT)
This is name for
unbearable loser, yes?

16:55.348 --> 16:55.680
A jag?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.549
Foreign kid's right.
I don't want to be a jag.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.252
Also, why is there an old man
in our super-cool group?

17:01.254 --> 17:04.155
Every group has
a life of the party,

17:04.157 --> 17:05.123
and that's Pops.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.592
I'm our badass leader,
Sergei's the funny one.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.561
And, of course, we got
our wild card, Naked Dan.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.462
Naked Dan?

17:11.464 --> 17:12.563
This is weird. I'm out.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.065
Is decided.
Naked Sergei!

17:14.067 --> 17:17.635
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While Barry was realizing</i>
<i> what the JTP meant to him,</i>

17:17.637 --> 17:21.172
<i> the jar wars had taken on</i>
<i> a whole new meaning.</i>

17:21.174 --> 17:24.208
(CLOCK TICKING)

17:30.350 --> 17:32.650
You know, I never thought
I'd say these words,

17:32.652 --> 17:34.852
but the silence
is making me crazy.

17:34.854 --> 17:35.920
Somebody say something!

17:35.922 --> 17:37.155
Uh-uh!
If I say anything,

17:37.157 --> 17:40.158
we're gonna end up
in Colonial Williams-turd.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.659
Baditude! That's $5.

17:41.661 --> 17:46.764
Pay up for comparing
our beloved U.S. history
to poo-poos.

17:46.933 --> 17:47.265
Poo-poos!

17:47.267 --> 17:50.802
All right, enough!
I'm putting an end to this
once and for all.

17:50.804 --> 17:51.903
Hey, I only made
these other jars

17:51.905 --> 17:55.073
'cause you made me realize
that they were playing me.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.809
Of course they were.
They're awful.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.277
That's part
of their charm,

17:59.279 --> 18:00.711
just like swearing's
part of yours.

18:00.713 --> 18:04.282
But Adam was right,
he learned it
from watching me.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.517
You swear
because you care.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.519
And I wouldn't want
to change that.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.121
For sure.
Sadly, he's right.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.289
And I'm not changing.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.224
I'm gonna keep
calling them morons

18:13.226 --> 18:14.225
because
they act like morons.

18:14.227 --> 18:18.429
And I can't change the fact
saying "Star Track"
will always bother me.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.166
And there's, like,
zero chance of me
changing my crap attitude,

18:22.168 --> 18:23.734
'cause you're all lame.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.504
See? We are who we are.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.505
And I love it!

18:27.507 --> 18:29.474
Dad's right.
I feel the same way.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.577
So, we all agree,
no more jar wars.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.846
"Jar wars"
sounds like<i> Star Wars!</i>

18:34.848 --> 18:36.314
Oh, God,
it felt so good to say.

18:36.316 --> 18:39.183
ADULT ADAM:<i> With that,</i>
<i> the jar wars came to an end.</i>

18:39.185 --> 18:40.485
<i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> my brother was hoping</i>

18:40.487 --> 18:42.920
<i> for a new beginning</i>
<i> with his friends.</i>

18:42.922 --> 18:44.455
Hey.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.390
Can I talk to you guys?

18:47.627 --> 18:50.895
Come on, guys.
Give him a chance.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.663
Thanks, man.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.999
I was a jerk, okay?

18:55.001 --> 18:59.370
Look, the three of you
are the first real
friends I ever had,

18:59.372 --> 19:03.141
and I just didn't want
to lose you to someone else
and be all alone again.

19:03.743 --> 19:04.742
Dude.
Dude.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.411
Dude!
So, to make it
up to you,

19:07.413 --> 19:10.581
I bought tickets
to the next Dead show.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.984
Hoping maybe
I can tag along?

19:12.986 --> 19:15.219
Don't look at me.
I'm not the leader.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.688
No one is.
We're just...

19:18.958 --> 19:20.057
The JTP.

19:20.059 --> 19:20.558
ALL: JTP.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.561
Uh, Bar, these tickets
are for Fairmount Park.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.730
How are we
supposed to get there?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.099
No way!
Awesome!

19:28.101 --> 19:30.968
This seems like a big move
for a band we just got into,

19:30.970 --> 19:31.936
but I like it.
Yep.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.871
(THE GRATEFUL DEAD'S
<i> TOUCH OF GREY</i> PLAYS)

19:33.873 --> 19:35.473
Good to have you back,
Big Tasty.

19:35.475 --> 19:38.109
It's good to be back,
Matt Bradley.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.477
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was official.</i>

19:39.479 --> 19:43.181
<i> The JTP had their newest,</i>
<i> chillest member,</i>

19:43.516 --> 19:45.283
<i> Matt Bradley.</i>

19:45.285 --> 19:46.851
<i> And to this very day,</i>

19:46.853 --> 19:49.487
<i> he's still my brother's</i>
<i> closest, dearest friend.</i>

19:49.489 --> 19:54.725
<i> That's what happens</i>
<i> when you open your heart</i>
<i> and let someone in.</i>

19:56.963 --> 19:57.428
What's this?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.130
We mapped out
the best route
to Williamsburg.

19:59.132 --> 20:03.367
We took all the money
from the swear jars
and booked a hotel room.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.069
We thought
you deserved a trip.

20:05.071 --> 20:08.072
And I say that
without any attitude.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.474
<i> ¶ I will get by ¶</i>

20:10.476 --> 20:14.845
I truly, madly, deeply
love you so (BLEEP) much,

20:14.847 --> 20:16.314
I can't stand it.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.149
Us too, Mama.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.486
Guess I'm schlepping
to Williamsburg.

20:23.223 --> 20:23.521
Morons.

20:23.523 --> 20:26.457
ADULT ADAM:<i> 'Cause in the end,</i>
<i> no matter</i>
<i> what you go through...</i>

20:26.459 --> 20:27.992
<i> ¶ I will get by ¶</i>

20:27.994 --> 20:30.895
<i> If you have your friends</i>
<i> and family by your side,</i>

20:30.897 --> 20:32.296
<i> you will get by.</i>

20:32.298 --> 20:35.533
<i> ¶ I will get by ¶</i>

20:35.535 --> 20:36.934
¶¶

20:36.936 --> 20:41.405
ADAM: Will Matthew Bradley
come out as a winner today?

20:43.343 --> 20:44.842
He's got the smile.

20:44.844 --> 20:48.913
Or will Barry Goldberg
be a winner today?

20:53.186 --> 20:56.721
The cream is then agitated
by the motion of the stick,

20:56.723 --> 20:58.422
creating
thick, rich butter.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.891
Ma'am, would you like
to give it a try?

21:00.893 --> 21:01.626
I'm good.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.160
I'm approaching
the natives now.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.128
They seem to have
a leader.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.464
Dude, no!
I told you not to do this.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.432
Greetings,
Colonial settlers.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.701
I have come
from the year 2032

21:10.703 --> 21:13.070
to warn you
of impending doom.

21:13.072 --> 21:13.604
Everyone disregard.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.340
Time travel is
not part of the tour.
Not part of the tour!

21:16.342 --> 21:17.708
See, I knew
you'd say that.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.477
Proving that
I'm from the future,

21:19.479 --> 21:20.478
where robots have taken over

21:20.480 --> 21:24.215
and their power source is
pure, thick, rich butter!

21:24.217 --> 21:26.751
I'm starting up the Adam jar
again. It's for your own good.

21:26.753 --> 21:31.088
One of the female followers is
a sad loner with no boyfriend.
