10:34.951 --> 10:36.709
every time
I shot him in the chest.

10:36.803 --> 10:40.121
You're a little late, though.
I just sold him to those guys.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.531
(Bart and Lisa gasp)

10:41.700 --> 10:43.624
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where-where
are you going with that?

10:43.644 --> 10:47.036
We're taking it to the new
local offices of J.J. Abrams.

10:47.130 --> 10:48.554
J.J. Abrams.

10:48.649 --> 10:52.709
What's a big Hollywood director
doing in Springfield?

10:52.802 --> 10:54.819
Making the next
<i> Mission: Impossible.</i>

10:55.046 --> 10:57.063
Downtown Springfield's
standing in for Somalia.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.382
What does he want with
this rickety piece of junk?

10:59.475 --> 11:00.641
As a visionary genius,

11:00.661 --> 11:02.327
J.J. needs to be kept
in a constant state

11:02.496 --> 11:04.237
of childlike wonder,

11:04.331 --> 11:07.056
so we fill his creative
space with kitsch,

11:07.225 --> 11:09.058
whimsy, memorabilia.

11:09.152 --> 11:10.393
-(phone dings)
-(all gasp)

11:10.486 --> 11:12.395
J.J. needs a Garbage Pail Kids
pinball machine

11:12.564 --> 11:15.131
and a roll of 1982 quarters.

11:16.234 --> 11:17.425
Go, go, go!

11:20.906 --> 11:22.405
Can I help you?

11:22.498 --> 11:24.498
Yeah, we're a cool, young,

11:24.592 --> 11:27.927
brother-sister directing team
and we'd like to speak

11:28.021 --> 11:32.006
to a low-level executive
about a vague idea we have.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.692
Super vague.

11:33.919 --> 11:35.485
Right away!

11:45.021 --> 11:46.612
(gasps)
There's the yak.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.374
But how are we gonna
get it out of here?

11:58.051 --> 12:01.202
Step away from the kitsch.

12:01.296 --> 12:04.038
What are you thinking, trying to
steal from a Hollywood big shot?

12:04.132 --> 12:06.165
That's like murdering
a dozen normos.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.634
Sorry, Dad. We thought
it would make you happy

12:08.803 --> 12:10.895
if we got your old band
back together.

12:11.047 --> 12:14.640
The Phuntime Phunky Phour?
That's impossible.

12:14.809 --> 12:17.986
I'll never
see those guys... again.

12:19.055 --> 12:20.905
Yak.

12:21.057 --> 12:22.240
It's you.

12:22.391 --> 12:24.993
MAN:
What a touching scene.

12:26.062 --> 12:27.579
I know just how to shoot it.

12:27.730 --> 12:29.138
-It's J.J.!
-Roll his calls!

12:29.157 --> 12:30.582
Don't step on his shadow.

12:30.809 --> 12:33.251
Oh, no, I'm wearing
the same shirt as him. Aah!

12:33.402 --> 12:35.161
-Hi, I'm J.J.
-Homer Jay.

12:35.330 --> 12:37.146
Sorry my kids
tried to steal from you.

12:37.315 --> 12:38.331
It's just that
they were trying

12:38.483 --> 12:41.926
to get this old robot back,
so... so...

12:42.078 --> 12:44.153
So they could reunite
the entire animatronic band

12:44.172 --> 12:46.431
to heal the broken teenager
inside of you.

12:46.658 --> 12:47.432
(all gasp)

12:47.659 --> 12:50.101
How did you know my secret pain?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.103
I didn't.
My storytelling sense told me

12:52.330 --> 12:54.939
this was the only emotionally
cathartic end to your journey.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.141
Master of story!

12:57.368 --> 13:00.169
He's the ultimate architect
of cinematic universes,

13:00.263 --> 13:02.005
<i> and</i> my dad's friend.

13:02.098 --> 13:03.114
Mm...

13:03.283 --> 13:05.950
I need to see
all the robots together.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.285
Wipe to...

13:07.454 --> 13:10.179
(gasps)
Foxxy, Turkey,

13:10.198 --> 13:11.956
Hippie, and Wakkety!

13:12.183 --> 13:13.866
You're all here.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.127
I've never seen such
genuine childlike wonder.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.354
And I've been to dozens
of test screenings.

13:18.523 --> 13:20.447
Homer, your emotional connection
to these characters

13:20.467 --> 13:22.191
has shown me
that your journey can be

13:22.285 --> 13:23.359
a universal experience,

13:23.528 --> 13:25.361
-or at least Dreamworks.
-What?

13:25.454 --> 13:27.288
I have wonderful news:
I'm gonna make these robots

13:27.307 --> 13:30.533
the stars of their own
nine-movie franchise.

13:30.702 --> 13:31.868
Buy the underlying IP.

13:32.037 --> 13:33.961
-Done. You own it.
-Fantastic.

13:34.013 --> 13:35.705
Take them away.
Take them?

13:35.798 --> 13:37.373
But we just got reunited.

13:37.542 --> 13:39.225
Oh, but I need them.
My visual effects artists

13:39.319 --> 13:40.801
have to scan them
into supercomputers

13:40.895 --> 13:43.229
so our mind-blowing reboot
will make its release date:

13:43.323 --> 13:46.382
March 30--
the new Fourth of July.

13:46.475 --> 13:48.409
No!
(whimpering)

13:50.238 --> 13:51.554
(sobbing)

13:51.647 --> 13:54.666
No! The same thing
happened again,

13:54.893 --> 13:57.168
but slightly different,
years later.

13:57.395 --> 13:59.295
It's what I do.

14:06.571 --> 14:09.422
I had them back
and I lost them again.

14:09.574 --> 14:12.499
Homie, I know
how hard this is for you.

14:12.668 --> 14:15.094
I always say
you shouldn't do this,

14:15.246 --> 14:17.671
but maybe-- just this once--

14:17.840 --> 14:19.840
you should go eat your feelings.

14:20.009 --> 14:22.176
Six feelings with extra cheese.

14:22.270 --> 14:23.586
An order of French feelings,

14:23.679 --> 14:27.348
and a super chocolate
frosty depression.

14:27.516 --> 14:29.850
I also recommend
a hot apple cry.

14:29.944 --> 14:32.954
Yes, I recognize
a fellow sadness swallower.

14:34.190 --> 14:37.934
And then J.J. Abrams
took my robots away...

14:38.027 --> 14:40.770
so he could reboot them.

14:40.863 --> 14:43.272
Why do Hollywood guys
only want to make movies?

14:43.441 --> 14:46.050
I used to be like you,
getting angry at filmmakers

14:46.202 --> 14:49.128
who ruined my favorite
childhood characters,

14:49.222 --> 14:51.556
stewing in silence.
But now,

14:51.725 --> 14:55.301
thanks to the Internet,
I can fight back.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.303
-You can?
-Oh, yes, my friend.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.788
It is called "trolling."

14:58.881 --> 15:02.141
Thanks to social media
super-soldiers like myself,

15:02.310 --> 15:04.569
studios spent millions
to remove

15:04.796 --> 15:07.463
Sonic the Hedgehog's
creepy human teeth.

15:07.556 --> 15:09.315
We changed the world

15:09.409 --> 15:11.576
of video game adaptations
I never saw.

15:11.803 --> 15:13.803
Then I'll do it.
I'll become a troll,

15:13.896 --> 15:15.580
stop J.J. Abrams' reboot,

15:15.823 --> 15:18.324
and save my childhood.

15:18.493 --> 15:20.401
And now I'm eating a feeling

15:20.569 --> 15:22.462
I've never felt before.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.968
♪

15:45.670 --> 15:46.611
Marge, I've done it.

15:46.838 --> 15:48.004
The boycott
is gaining momentum--

15:48.022 --> 15:50.673
the supportive comments
are pouring in.

15:50.692 --> 15:53.025
Three of them!

15:53.178 --> 15:56.345
Homer, please. You've missed
so much of your life.

15:56.364 --> 15:57.680
Of our lives.

15:57.699 --> 15:59.958
It's only a movie.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.964
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe I have been

16:06.115 --> 16:08.541
taking this nostalgia-fueled
vendetta too far.

17:09.696 --> 17:13.197
destroying someone else's
passion project.

17:13.424 --> 17:16.517
Yes, every fan deserves movies
that are individually tailored

17:16.685 --> 17:18.928

17:26.195 --> 17:27.361
featuring the voice talents

17:27.455 --> 17:29.363
of whoever was famous
eight months ago.

17:29.532 --> 17:30.697
(all quietly exclaiming)

17:30.866 --> 17:32.291
But the real heroes
are the thousands

17:32.385 --> 17:34.627
of computer artists
who worked around the clock,

17:34.796 --> 17:36.721
slowly going blind,
at such effects houses as

17:36.872 --> 17:38.798
Dream Prison,
Digital Sweatshop,

17:38.966 --> 17:41.450
Indentured Server-dudes,
and too many others to count.

17:41.544 --> 17:42.802
-Or pay.
-MAN: Yeah!

17:42.896 --> 17:44.395
And now, without further ado...

17:44.547 --> 17:47.548
Did somebody ask for ado?

17:47.642 --> 17:48.474
(all gasp)

17:48.568 --> 17:50.234
Hey, Homer.
Good to see you.

17:50.386 --> 17:53.145
Yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

17:53.239 --> 17:56.056
This man took simple,
beautiful animal robots

17:56.150 --> 17:57.742
designed to sell pizza

17:57.969 --> 18:00.486
and turned them into something
crass and commercial.

18:00.655 --> 18:04.140
Well, it's all over, J.J.--

18:04.233 --> 18:06.876
if those<i> are</i> your real initials.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.928
I'm going to burn
the only copy of this movie.

18:17.079 --> 18:19.580
Actually, the movie's backed up
on servers all over the world.

18:19.674 --> 18:21.490
That reel is just a prop
from the snack stand.

18:21.509 --> 18:24.769
Oh.
I wondered why it was buttery.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.939
You can't release this movie.
Changing those characters

18:28.166 --> 18:31.317
-will ruin my childhood.
-GRAMPA: Bullpucky!

18:32.278 --> 18:33.336
(all gasp)

18:33.354 --> 18:35.004

18:35.022 --> 18:37.598
So that's who
Mom called earlier.

18:37.692 --> 18:39.492
So satisfying.

18:40.644 --> 18:43.012
Son, a movie
can't ruin your childhood.

18:43.030 --> 18:46.641
I ruined it
by being a terrible father.

18:46.643 --> 18:49.368
-But the movie.
-No, it was me.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.945
I put you down,
I never listened to you,

18:51.965 --> 18:54.523
said your dreams
were ridiculous.

18:54.692 --> 18:56.467
Maybe it was the way
I was brought up.

18:56.694 --> 18:58.861
Men back then
could only love sports stars

18:58.954 --> 19:00.972
and auto makes.

19:01.141 --> 19:04.049
I was a Chevy man
and I thought that was enough.

19:04.144 --> 19:07.127
The '63 Impala SS sport coupe--

19:07.147 --> 19:10.039
now, that was a son.

19:10.208 --> 19:13.042
Of course.
It's not the movie that sucks,

19:13.211 --> 19:15.378
it was you sucking.

19:15.546 --> 19:17.880
It was always you sucking.

19:17.973 --> 19:21.550
I hate you, Dad.

19:21.644 --> 19:22.702
ALL:
Aw.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.497
Homer, I know you were
attached to the past,

19:26.724 --> 19:29.225
but this movie--
all 71 minutes of it--

19:29.394 --> 19:30.743
might help
a new generation of kids

19:30.895 --> 19:32.503
forget their terrible parents.

19:32.730 --> 19:36.490
-Like us, Dad.
-I want to forget so bad.

19:36.584 --> 19:39.993
-Mm.
-Go on, make your movie.

19:40.162 --> 19:41.328
It's literally already done.

19:41.497 --> 19:44.073
I guess the only time
I'll see my friends now

19:44.166 --> 19:45.850
is on the big screen.

19:46.077 --> 19:47.977
