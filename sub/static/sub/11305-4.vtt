WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:03.080
<i>Previously on Wynonna Earp...</i>

00:03.253 --> 00:05.253
- What the sweet hell is this?
- I'm ready to help.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.955
You're supposed
to be normal, Waverly.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.714
I scoured every archive
in the country

00:08.884 --> 00:10.500
and you know what I never found?

00:10.677 --> 00:12.384
The reason why
I can't break the curse.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.137
- What is that?
- Maldito, New Mexico.

00:15.307 --> 00:17.344
This is what victories
might have to look like.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.134
There's something about him.

00:19.311 --> 00:20.927
- Where are you staying?
- A trailer park

00:21.104 --> 00:23.391
proprietered by
one Bobo Del Rey.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.147
You do not know what I am.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.808
I know what
you're supposed to be.

00:26.985 --> 00:31.025
My name is John Henry,
but most people just call me Doc.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.026
I'm gonna tell you a tale

00:37.204 --> 00:38.866
about the last time I saw
my best friend,

00:39.039 --> 00:41.907
the man who happens to be
your forebear.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.871
I'm all ears, Hank. Hit me.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.293
I'm all packed up,
ready to go, Doc.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.302
Headed for a burg
called Purgatory.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.089
See a corrupted lawman there,
out of fix

00:58.267 --> 01:01.226
and in need of
a little adjustment.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.395
I've heard some things
of the particular corruption

01:03.480 --> 01:05.312
of that damn sheriff.

01:06.316 --> 01:09.104
Save your hoodoo-voodoo talk
for your calico queens.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.440
They say he's part devil.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.530
Ain't no such thing as devils.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.738
Only men and the good and evil
they do in this world.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.527
What say you, huh?

01:19.705 --> 01:22.072
You got enough breath in you
for one more fight?

01:22.249 --> 01:24.332
I think this is farewell, Wyatt.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.788
Ah, fiddle-faddle.
You'll be fine.

01:26.962 --> 01:30.000
Farewell, old friend.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.512
I'll see you
on the other side, Doc.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.399 --> 01:49.186
It's a cute story.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.319
But if you want me to believe
you're Doc Holliday,

01:51.361 --> 01:52.977
you're gonna have to prove it.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.817
Not only was Doc famous
for having

01:54.990 --> 01:56.606
the quickest draw in the West
but also...

01:56.783 --> 01:59.116
For the sharpness of my eye.

02:01.288 --> 02:04.247
Now, has my little demonstration
convinced you?

02:05.250 --> 02:07.037
Not yet.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.070
So you're Doc...
you're Doc Holliday.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.856
Well, then, what are you?

02:39.034 --> 02:41.315
'Cause if you were a revenant,
you'd be blown off my land.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.035
So what? A ghost?

02:43.205 --> 02:45.822
Now, if I were a ghost,

02:45.999 --> 02:48.457
would my heart be pounding
like it is?

02:51.963 --> 02:54.421
You were reported dead
130 years ago.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.833
I made a barter
for eternal longevity.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.172
Cured me of chronic tuberculosis

02:59.346 --> 03:01.508
and freed me from
the ravages of time

03:01.682 --> 03:04.299
unless I catch a bullet,
a knife or an oncoming train.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.593
With that mouth,
I give you 10 minutes.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.602
What did Wyatt think about that?

03:09.773 --> 03:11.935
I brokered the deal
long after Wyatt

03:12.109 --> 03:14.101
and I bid our fare-thee-wells.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.485
What about the curse?

03:16.655 --> 03:18.863
Did Wyatt say anything about
why his descendants

03:19.032 --> 03:20.864
have to battle
the outlaws he killed

03:21.034 --> 03:22.650
over and over and over again?

03:22.828 --> 03:24.785
Wyatt never mentioned it.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.491
I am sorry.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.199
Why are you here? Why Purgatory?

03:30.377 --> 03:31.993
Unfinished business.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.911
Well, that makes two of us.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.955
Ma'am.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.464
Doc freakin' Holliday.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.513
I didn't mean to do it, Sam.
It was an accident!

03:44.683 --> 03:46.549
Please! PLEASE forgive me!

03:46.727 --> 03:48.719
Please! Say it!

03:48.895 --> 03:51.512
You need help, Megan.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.352
I do.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.108
I do.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.696
Please, somebody, help me.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.199
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.860
Forgiven? Or not?

04:11.334 --> 04:13.166
Please, please.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.328
I need more time.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.964
No, Megan. Your time is up.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.838
"Repent sinners."
Written in blood!

05:00.008 --> 05:02.375
- Good times.
- Mm-hm. Neighbour found the body.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.509
Nedley's outside
keeping rubberneckers at bay.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.887
He is slowly learning
how this works.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.141
And I haven't seen
this much blood since Kandahar.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.222
- What were you doing in Iraq?
- Afghanistan.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.011
And I'm gonna get you a map.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.976
And I'm not at liberty to discuss.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.936
You brought it up.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.898
Goddamn. Megan Halshford.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.564
- Friend of yours?
- Hell, no. Couldn't stand her.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.367
Megan Halshford?!
Aww, I always loved her.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.157
You didn't know her like I did.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.951
Waverly, do you know revenants
that leave messages like that?

05:37.128 --> 05:38.744
Do I!

05:38.922 --> 05:42.006
Father Robert Malick -
a hellfire revivalist minister

05:42.175 --> 05:45.213
known to rail against women,
demanding they repent.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.175
Wyatt hung Malick
for murdering his wife

05:48.348 --> 05:50.840
and his girlfriend,
and some hookers too.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.509
Any idea where he is
so I can shoot him in the dong?

05:53.687 --> 05:56.976
- Hiding like the rest of 'em?
- So we flush him out.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.060
Yeah. Ooh! Hey!

05:59.234 --> 06:01.066
Uh, I was kind of wondering

06:01.236 --> 06:03.569
if I could tag along
with you guys today?

06:03.738 --> 06:05.400
Uh, don't you have to work?

06:05.574 --> 06:08.317
Well, you know, it's super slow
and Gus said I could.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.109
Plus, seeing as I've done
the research,

06:10.287 --> 06:12.244
you know,
I know what questions to ask.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.246
I think we got this.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.079
Sure.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.868
Ok, so don't freak out.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.833
Our friend, Henry,
I spent the morning testing him,

06:22.007 --> 06:23.839
and it's offish - he is...

06:24.009 --> 06:25.671
What, Doc Holliday?

06:25.844 --> 06:27.881
You knew
and you didn't tell me?!

06:28.054 --> 06:29.670
Well, I bet he can help us.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.589
Look, I don't think so.
OK, Wynonna?

06:31.766 --> 06:34.258
I followed him to a secret meeting
with Bobo Del Rey.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.224
And something happened.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.229
Oh, my God,
what did he do to you?

06:40.233 --> 06:43.692
He kind of shot at my head.
And there was some pinching.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.924
- Let's just talk about this.
- You threatened my sister!

06:46.948 --> 06:49.068
- What's to talk about?
- I will confess only to this.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.827
A sorry state of finances
which compels me to ply my trade.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.988
- Dentistry?
- No. My other trade, poker.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.976
Now, I have spied
lurking in those dark corners

06:57.000 --> 06:58.662
a number of revenants,

06:58.835 --> 07:01.873
so my aim was to steer little sister
from their foul company.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.959
Back up a sec.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.670
You're saying Bobo's hiding revenants
in the trailer park?

07:06.843 --> 07:08.926
I'm only speculating
on a hypothesis.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.588
Alright, I get it,
but let's just say, hypothetically,

07:12.766 --> 07:15.133
that I was looking for
a certain revenant -

07:15.310 --> 07:17.848
let's call him Father Malick.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.887
Should I look
in the trailer park?

07:20.065 --> 07:22.728
Hypothetically? I'd say yep.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.897
So who told you Malick's here?

07:26.071 --> 07:28.688
- Not at liberty to discuss.
- So it's your friend Henry?

07:28.865 --> 07:31.323
You know one of these days
I'll have to meet this guy, right?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.906
One of these days you will.
Let's go talk to Bobo.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.116
- I know you got a score to settle.
- You think?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.702
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't just walk in there

07:38.875 --> 07:40.537
and shoot Bobo in the face.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.497
Because we're outgunned
and outnumbered.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.945
Rules of engagement - we do not fire
unless we are fired upon.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.631
Yeah, but if I take him out?

07:50.804 --> 07:53.046
- You die in a hail of gunfire.
- Blaze of glory.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.340
More like a blaze of stupidity.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.975
If you want to win this war,
we do it my way.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.181
Party pooper.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.860
Bobo.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.570
Wynonna Earp.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.535
Hello. It's been a while.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.581
No?

08:24.754 --> 08:26.586
I see.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.541
- Baby sister has better manners.
- Don't talk about Waverly.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.676
Why is that?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.008
It's not like I'm a stranger
to your clan.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.809
I knew your daddy Ward very well
while he was alive.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.892
Yeah, you know damn well
how he died too.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.933
That's that wild imagination,
always gets you into trouble.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.772
You'd think that
after all the months

08:48.945 --> 08:50.923
in St Victoria's psychiatric,
you would know the difference

08:50.947 --> 08:54.361
between what is real
and what ain't.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.072
OK. So you want to get real?

08:57.245 --> 08:59.077
Yeah.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.870
Black star. Wow!

09:09.966 --> 09:13.835
You're a long way from home,
Marshal, uh... Dolls.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.844
Deputy Marshal Dolls.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.182
And you don't have much
in the way of, uh...

09:21.269 --> 09:22.635
backup.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.098
Just one crazy girl.

09:24.272 --> 09:27.231
One crazy girl
and a very big gun.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.897
Look, this badge
is all the backup I need.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.939
One phone call and I can cause
your world a whole lot of pain.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.653
Let me guess -
black choppers, Tomahawks

09:36.826 --> 09:38.442
and one steaming crater
in the ground.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.236
Am I right?

09:40.413 --> 09:43.406
Did you know I had friends
in Maldito?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.950
We're looking for
Father Robert Malick.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.210
We thought you might know
where he is.

09:49.380 --> 09:53.841
Say I did know where Father is.

09:54.010 --> 09:58.926
And let's say that I gave you
permission to speak to him.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.716
I would suspect that
if he came to harm in any way,

10:01.893 --> 10:04.476
there would be, uh,
consequences.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.223
Now, the good father
doesn't believe

10:09.400 --> 10:11.608
that cleanliness
is next to godliness,

10:11.778 --> 10:14.521
so you will find his tent
by way of smell.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.859
Oh...

10:17.867 --> 10:19.529
you have my permission.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.449
We'll see you soon, Bobo.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.835
Time will tell.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.916
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.894
- Robert Malick?
- Father Malick to you.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.733
We're here to talk about
Megan Halshford.

10:56.906 --> 11:01.196
Sounds like a whore!
Then again, you're all whores.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.533
You had me at whore.
Still, would you take a look?

11:07.876 --> 11:11.119
Struck down by the blade
of immortal reckoning.

11:11.296 --> 11:14.004
It was her guilt
sharpened the knife.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.051
- Always the guilt.
- Guilt about what?

11:19.220 --> 11:22.713
Sinners sin, killers kill,

11:22.891 --> 11:25.304
whores whore!

11:25.476 --> 11:28.184
Only she can tell you
why she needed to repent.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.471
- Is that why you killed her?
- Me?

11:30.648 --> 11:32.264
I'm always here

11:32.442 --> 11:35.105
ever since they took my legs!

11:35.278 --> 11:38.112
OK. Put the sheet back on, stumpy,
I just ate breakfast.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.732
So you're not the killer.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.947
But you know him, don't you?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.612
His blade thirsts for you.

11:46.789 --> 11:50.203
He will drink from the cup
of your sins,

11:50.376 --> 11:51.912
whore!

12:08.311 --> 12:11.349
- What just happened?
- I saw him in the mirror.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.649
Earp?

12:23.618 --> 12:25.450
He was here,
the psycho with the razor,

12:25.620 --> 12:27.407
and on the night of the attack.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.030
He's another one of the Seven.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.495
Or Reverend Skanky's not
the crazy one.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.996
OK, you think I'm bonkers, right?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.836
Seeing shit like revenants
appearing and disappearing?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.046
But as far as we know,
they don't have that power.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.678
No.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.867
So, what, we're dealing with
the David Blaine of revenants?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.304
Well, we better not be because
that would be a game changer.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.762
A neighbour saw a car
leave Megan's house

12:53.940 --> 12:55.556
around the time she was killed.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.271
Officer Haught ran the plates
and got us a name.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.231
Samantha Baker.

13:01.239 --> 13:04.403
Samantha 'Perky Tits' Baker.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.692
Another one of the Britneys
that froze me out.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.529
Let me guess,
you two were real close?

13:10.707 --> 13:12.664
Like this.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.497
I've barely spoken to Megan
since high school.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.208
And out of the blue,
she calls me,

13:18.381 --> 13:20.213
says I have to come over
right away.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.921
She's freaking right out,
saying she needs to confess.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.336
Confess for what?

13:25.513 --> 13:27.313
Sorry, I'm still trying to
wrap my head around

13:27.348 --> 13:29.214
why anyone would give
Wynonna Earp a badge.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.180
- Me too, sister.
- What did she need to confess?

13:33.438 --> 13:37.148
OK, on the last day of school
in 11th grade,

13:37.317 --> 13:39.274
there was this big bash.

13:40.278 --> 13:43.521
You were there, right?
Getting destroyed as usual?

13:43.698 --> 13:45.314
Go on.

13:45.491 --> 13:49.701
I remember walking home,
seeing the red lights, spinning.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.956
The officer talking to my mom.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.037
My dad was killed
in a hit-and-run.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.826
I remember.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.065
Last I heard, they didn't find
the person responsible, right?

14:00.089 --> 14:02.502
That's what Megan wanted
to confess to me.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.718
It was her - she was the one.

14:06.888 --> 14:10.802
She begged me to forgive her,
like her life depended on it.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.967
So did you?

14:13.144 --> 14:15.557
She killed my dad.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.188
And some people
you just can't forgive.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.104
No matter how hard they try.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.280
Well, hello, little sister.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.368
I'm gonna need a bottle
of whisky, a glass

14:35.541 --> 14:37.157
and some of those ice squares.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.997
I am gasping.

14:39.170 --> 14:42.834
Management reserves the right
to refuse service to jackasses.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.623
I'm management

14:44.801 --> 14:46.337
and you're the jackass.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.341
Hmm!

14:55.770 --> 14:58.012
Friend, you seem to be

14:58.189 --> 15:00.476
at the intersection of misery
and despair.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.477
Done some things -

15:05.655 --> 15:09.319
bad, stupid things -
over and over.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.324
Wife can't forgive me.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.117
I deserve what's coming,
but it's gonna hurt.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.082
Yeah, we have all made mistakes,
friend.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.868
I have spent many a night

15:21.045 --> 15:23.082
wherein I ruminated on
the errors I've made.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.464
But then it strikes me,

15:25.633 --> 15:27.340
it was the wrongs done to me

15:27.510 --> 15:29.217
that put me
down the well of tribulations.

15:29.387 --> 15:32.175
So I set myself upon
a mission of vengeance.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.010
And let me tell you, friend,

15:34.183 --> 15:36.641
it shall be biblical.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.442
I reckon I've said too much.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.029
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.365
Forgiven? Or not?

16:32.366 --> 16:34.608
Oh, my God.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.574
No. No.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.751
No.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.628
No. No!

16:46.797 --> 16:48.914
This is why I never wanted
to come back here.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.128
Spit it out, Earp.
We don't get overtime.

16:51.302 --> 16:55.342
OK, I was 16 and fresh out of
my eighth foster home,

16:55.515 --> 16:58.428
and even for Purgatory High,
Megan was...

16:58.601 --> 17:00.843
Ugh!

17:01.020 --> 17:03.433
You know, her dad owned
the local slaughterhouse

17:03.606 --> 17:07.098
and she used to fill my locker
with entrails.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.983
Every Friday.

17:09.153 --> 17:12.112
Because my clothes were wrong,
because I'd been in juvie.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.069
Because I was the crazy girl
who killed her own father.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.983
Where are you going with this?

17:18.621 --> 17:20.657
Uh, that bash
Samantha talked about?

17:20.830 --> 17:23.164
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, I was there.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.040
But I wasn't getting wasted,

17:25.211 --> 17:27.544
I was hooking up with
Megan's boyfriend, Brad.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.581
Didn't even like him. Really.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.375
I just wanted to hurt Megan
the best way I knew how.

17:34.470 --> 17:39.932
And so she found me on top of him,
and payback's a bitch.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.514
She lost it -
bawled her eyes out, total mess.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.600
Grabbed Brad's car keys
and peeled out.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.733
Problem is, Megan...

17:49.902 --> 17:51.393
Megan couldn't drive.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.485
I never thought about how
she got home and now I find out...

17:55.658 --> 17:56.990
- Wynonna...
- No, stop.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.650
I've heard that tone
my whole life.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.578
Actually, I was gonna say
you were only 16.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.877
We all make mistakes.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.709
It's the most un-Dolls thing
you've ever said to me.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.128
Partner, they're looking to
settle up the tab.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.387
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.816
Well, shit.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.114
Waverly, I can explain.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.370
There's a face
I didn't want to see again.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.830
Jay Novak, my probation officer.

18:50.004 --> 18:52.087
- Why would Henry kill him?
- He didn't.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.872
He was the only other person
in here.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.292
Yeah, but he's not a revenant
and the killer has to be.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.256
I still don't trust him.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.216
Why not?

19:02.099 --> 19:04.591
What are you two not telling me
about your friend Henry?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.683
OK. Guess I'll have to
find out for myself.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.693
Wynonna's told me
a lot about you.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.738
Peculiar - she has told me
nothing about you, Mr...

19:25.915 --> 19:27.827
Dolls. Deputy Marshal Dolls.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.741
And you're in serious trouble,
Henry.

19:29.919 --> 19:33.253
You are looking good
for two homicides.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.836
Oh, now, that is one thing
we can agree on - I do look great.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.548
You know, I ran your prints
through IAFIS, then Interpol,

19:40.721 --> 19:42.838
then every single national database
I could think of.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.098
And you know what I found
on you?

19:45.267 --> 19:47.975
Nothing.

19:48.145 --> 19:52.981
You're a non-entity,
which means you have no rights.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.732
So start talking.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.815
I am a professional card sharp,
Mr Dolls,

19:57.988 --> 20:00.856
so I can read a man's eyes.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.150
And I do not like
what I see in yours.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.741
- No shit.
- Tell me.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.659
Ooh, I see a captain

20:12.837 --> 20:16.672
piloting a ship full of secrets
through a stormy sea.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.958
And as a gentleman
who cares about Wynonna,

20:19.135 --> 20:23.300
I will recommend that she quit you
lest she drown.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.052
Is Deputy Marshal Dolls
laughing?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.437
I've never been so scared
in my life.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.521
You know what I see
in your eyes?

20:39.947 --> 20:41.984
A man who doesn't like
small spaces.

20:42.158 --> 20:45.276
You been in prison?

20:45.453 --> 20:48.491
Solitary confinement. Ooh.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.535
Was that fun?

20:52.918 --> 20:54.534
I have said all I intend to say.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.203
Mm-hm.

20:58.424 --> 21:02.088
It's nice talking to you... Hank.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.431
- You're gonna release him?
- He's still a suspect.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.309
Earp,
when were you gonna tell me

21:15.483 --> 21:18.100
you were kicking it
with the ghost of Doc Holliday?

21:19.904 --> 21:21.987
How did you find out?

21:23.991 --> 21:26.859
He's not a ghost.
He's got eternal longevity.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.055
I was definitely gonna tell
you before Christmas. Mm-hm.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.891
Because then you could be
each other's secret Santas.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.531
How cute would that be?

21:34.627 --> 21:37.244
Poor dead sucker's wife
just called asking for Wynonna.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.913
- For me?
- Did I stutter?

21:40.090 --> 21:43.049
I said I wanted to talk to you,
Wynonna. Who's this fella?

21:43.219 --> 21:44.835
Boss-man. Package deal.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.129
OK, Suzie,
start from the beginning.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.515
This afternoon,
my husband comes to me,

21:50.684 --> 21:52.971
says for 10 years he's been
a big-time drug dealer.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.761
I thought he was
a probation officer.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.147
Yeah, well,
that's a good cover, isn't it?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.436
Sometimes, Jay would put
his probationers to work too.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.226
Unpaid minions.

22:01.403 --> 22:04.987
Making a delivery one night,
I got arrested. Didn't snitch.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.864
Got sent back to juvie
for the third time.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.650
Another nail in my coffin.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.990
- Did you know he was dealing?
- Oh, a little weed.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.779
I didn't know he'd become.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.573
Purgatory's answer
to Walter White.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.458
Not until today.
It was like he'd lost his mind!

22:17.628 --> 22:20.041
He kept going on about
this spectre coming for him,

22:20.214 --> 22:22.206
that I NEED to forgive him.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.126
And then the spectre comes
to me.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.545
- The mirrors.
- Oh, shit, Wynonna.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.965
Gives me two hours.
I only have a few minutes left!

22:32.142 --> 22:34.538
We need to split up, cover every
reflective surface you can find.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.895
We gotta block his way
from going in. Go! Now!

22:42.862 --> 22:44.774
- We need to talk.
- Yeah, can it wait?

22:44.947 --> 22:46.609
I'm kind of trying
to save your ass here.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.399
You're gonna save me, alright.
I need you to forgive me.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.159
Why?

22:51.328 --> 22:54.787
Because I... I was to blame
for you being sent back to juvie.

22:54.957 --> 22:57.950
- What?
- One day, Jay comes to me.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.127
He says that the police
are starting to circle him,

23:00.170 --> 23:02.457
that he's needing something.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.748
I called an anonymous tip
on you.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.338
- You ratted me out?!
- It was you or my husband.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.627
You selfish...

23:08.804 --> 23:11.387
You need to forgive me
before it's too late.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.141
Yeah? I don't know that I can.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.888
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.726
Forgiven? Or not?

23:20.900 --> 23:24.109
Yeah, I forgive her!
OK? I forgive her.

23:24.278 --> 23:28.067
No, you don't.
Not in your heart.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.318
I can't move. Help me.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.781
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.665
Time's up.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.670
Mmm. I can taste it. Guilt!

23:50.846 --> 23:53.634
- Gross.
- Repent, Wynonna Earp.

23:53.807 --> 23:57.767
Two hours to find forgiveness
from the souls you've hurt.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.812
Tick-tock.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.728
Earp, what the hell happened?

24:07.905 --> 24:09.737
She's gone.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.862
And I'm next.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.616
It's simple -
I take 'Peacemaker',

24:16.789 --> 24:18.405
aim right between
the revenant's eyes...

24:18.582 --> 24:20.222
- You shoot.
- Boom! Back to hell they go.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.096
This guy can't throw in
a reflection clause.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.751
- That's not fair!
- Fair?

24:23.921 --> 24:25.708
He's a demon
and you shot a mirror.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.841
Yeah, that he travelled through!
Totally cheating.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.795
No, no, what I mean is
you shot a reflection,

24:29.969 --> 24:31.631
not the revenant itself.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.573
- So what does that mean?
- Itself, itself, itself.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.179
- Dolls.
- Shh!

24:35.349 --> 24:36.965
Just give me a minute, OK?

24:37.142 --> 24:39.462
OK, but too many more minutes
and he turns me into sashimi.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.393
Unless we transmogrify him.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.225
Do you come with
a translation app?

24:43.399 --> 24:44.981
We have to draw him
from his reflection

24:45.150 --> 24:46.732
and make him flesh and blood.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.110
- Yes!
- So we need his body?

24:49.279 --> 24:51.646
How hard's that for you to say?
"We need his body."

24:51.824 --> 24:53.440
I've encountered this before
at the BBD.

24:53.617 --> 24:56.781
In Kandahar, we dealt with
an iblis with a similar power.

24:56.954 --> 24:58.741
You were fighting demons
in the Middle East?

24:58.914 --> 25:00.892
Now, the ritual wasn't a total success -
four people died.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.033
That's like saying the 'Titanic'
ALMOST made land.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.370
But I know why it failed -
didn't have the right tools.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.211
But leave that to me.
That is plan A.

25:07.381 --> 25:08.997
And what's plan B?

25:09.174 --> 25:11.757
Find everyone you've hurt
and beg for their forgiveness.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.280
- It didn't work for the others.
- That's why it's called plan B.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.092
We need the killer's name.
It's very important.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.882
I'll put Waverly on it.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.721
Meet me back here in 90 minutes.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.682
- Also, bring extra hands.
- Dolls.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.645
How bad is this?

25:28.652 --> 25:30.439
I'll get what we need.

25:34.033 --> 25:37.367
Here I go. Plan B for begging.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.824
Pete. Pete?

25:45.002 --> 25:48.086
Oh, my God! Hey, it's been
a long time. Uh, can we talk?

25:48.255 --> 25:49.871
I'm kind of busy, Wynonna.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.041
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.377
I know it's been, like,
a million years since we dated,

25:54.470 --> 25:57.554
but, um, remember
your 19th birthday party?

25:57.723 --> 25:59.680
- I left early.
- You said you had cramps.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.637
- Yeah.
- "Mega cramps".

26:01.810 --> 26:03.893
Mega lied. I, uh...

26:04.063 --> 26:07.101
Ooh, I... I went home
with another fella.

26:07.274 --> 26:10.142
- Bro, the table's getting cold.
- Shut up, Kyle.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.526
- Who'd you go home with?
- Um... Oh...

26:16.992 --> 26:20.076
- Brother.
- You are such a shit, Wynonna!

26:20.245 --> 26:22.032
- Arrgh!
- Ugh!

26:22.206 --> 26:26.246
- What...
- Wait! You have to forgive me.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.751
Hey, what just happened
with the York boys?

26:28.921 --> 26:32.255
Funny story. Good story.
Uh, we found the killer.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.040
He gives his victims two hours

26:34.218 --> 26:36.460
to, uh, be forgiven for their sins
or he cuts them up.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.253
Oh, not that funny.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.173
He also travels through mirrors,
and guess who's his next victim.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.550
Wynonna, we need to get you on
the first bus outta town.

26:43.685 --> 26:45.267
No, I'm done running.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.770
And there's a lot of mirrors on buses.
God, I hate buses.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.602
- OK, what's the plan?
- OK.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.836
I need you to find
the revenant's original human name

26:51.860 --> 26:53.772
and then meet me back
at Black Badge.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.946
- Dolls says we need extra hands.
- Wait! For what?

26:56.824 --> 26:58.406
Hey, Wynonna,
I need more to go on.

26:58.575 --> 27:03.320
Uh...
Uhh, scary guy, mutton chops.

27:03.497 --> 27:05.657
Sorry, I'm supposed to go find
all the people I've hurt

27:05.749 --> 27:07.615
and beg their stupid
'forgivenessesses'!

27:07.793 --> 27:10.752
- But everyone hates you.
- I'm aware.

27:18.220 --> 27:21.054
I used to get a good night's sleep
in the old grey-bar hotel,

27:21.223 --> 27:22.885
but now it's pure torture.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.766
Which I gather you've come
to enjoy watching.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.552
You said
some really mean things.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.516
You tracked me
like a common horse thief.

27:29.690 --> 27:32.103
- Then you shot at me.
- No, I shot near you.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.563
Nonetheless,
I regret the episode.

27:34.736 --> 27:38.025
- Is that why you came down here?
- No. No.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.190
I come with a proposition.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.905
You saw the revenant, right?
The guy in the mirrors?

27:43.078 --> 27:46.196
So you help me identify him,
I'll get you out of here.

27:46.373 --> 27:49.957
Huh! I will most happily oblige.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.577
OK. Here.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.589
Newspaper clippings,
municipal records,

27:56.758 --> 27:58.920
police reports that I'm totally
not supposed to have.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.334
Waverly, you have put together
the most thorough resource

28:01.430 --> 28:03.046
on the revenants.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.089
You are one natural-born
investigator,

28:05.267 --> 28:07.099
just like your
great-great-granddaddy,

28:07.269 --> 28:10.808
and, I reckon, the true keeper
of the Earp flame.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.847
Can't blame you
for being miffed.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.234
What? 'Miffed'?
Who said I was miffed?

28:16.403 --> 28:18.019
- I'm not miffed.
- Well, I'll be damned.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.359
Here.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.398
This is the face
of the man I saw.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.694
August Hamilton?

28:26.872 --> 28:28.613
Oh, everybody went to see Augie
for a shave

28:28.790 --> 28:30.406
and to confess their sins.

28:30.584 --> 28:32.200
What was he,
like, the father confessor?

28:32.377 --> 28:34.217
Well, in a town with no church,
you needed one.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.371
But Wyatt found out
about a cattle rustler

28:36.548 --> 28:39.916
who confessed his crimes
to ole Father Augie,

28:40.093 --> 28:42.585
so Wyatt aimed to put Augie
on the witness stand.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.880
Let me take a wild guess.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.016
- Augie never made it to court?
- Mm-mm.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.302
Disappeared
the night before the trial.

28:50.479 --> 28:53.222
People say
foul play was involved.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.606
Wait,
how can August be a revenant,

28:55.776 --> 28:57.392
I mean,
if Wyatt didn't kill him?

28:57.569 --> 28:59.686
Oh, but he did. Most definitely.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.604
See, by forcing him to testify,

29:01.782 --> 29:03.819
Wyatt signed
his death certificate.

29:07.329 --> 29:10.993
- Wynonna needs my help.
- Hey, you promised my release.

29:14.336 --> 29:17.625
You know,
Dolls is gonna kill me.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.414
I really should ask him first.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.504
You let me outta here,
we go see him together?

29:22.678 --> 29:24.340
He won't mind a bit.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.282
- YOU belong in jail!
- How we gonna do this...

29:26.306 --> 29:28.798
You know I didn't do it!

29:28.976 --> 29:31.844
Hey! You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.977
The barber is coming
to slice up Wynonna

29:34.147 --> 29:36.810
and you guys are blubbering like
a big bunch of bratty babies!

29:36.984 --> 29:39.192
Thank you.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.818
That's a black mirror.
Made from Obsidian.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.283
- Was it on special at Ikea?
- Funny.

29:51.456 --> 29:54.324
Black Badge collects artefacts
from all over the world.

29:54.501 --> 29:57.021
What else is in your storehouse, Dolls?
The Ark of the Covenant?

29:57.129 --> 30:00.372
It's actually called
the Ark of the Testimony

30:00.549 --> 30:02.632
and we don't have it anymore.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.655
You surprise me, Dolls,
I never would have figured you

30:05.679 --> 30:07.636
for a practitioner
of the hoodoo-voodoo.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.719
This ain't no joke, Doc.
It's our best way of beating him.

30:10.892 --> 30:13.555
This ritual calls the spirit
by name

30:13.729 --> 30:16.062
and then the spirit
will become flesh.

30:16.231 --> 30:19.144
And you, Earp, will shoot him.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.560
- So I'm bait?
- More like brunch.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.316
- You studied ancient languages?
- Yeah.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.700
- You have?
- How's your Latin?

30:29.870 --> 30:32.032
Ego sum totaliter stupet balls.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.912
That's Latin for
"I'm totally amazeballs".

30:34.082 --> 30:36.165
OK, then.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.043
We will be invoking August
by name.

30:40.255 --> 30:44.875
But other spirits
will try and slip through.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.673
And some of them...

30:49.890 --> 30:51.597
still have a bone to pick
with me.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.383
Kandahar?

30:53.560 --> 30:55.643
We're all guilty of something,
right, Earp?

30:56.980 --> 30:59.643
What, we're just gonna flap our gums
or are we gonna get to it?

30:59.816 --> 31:01.773
August Hamilton...

31:01.943 --> 31:05.482
"Extra velum dicam
audite vocem meam."

31:05.655 --> 31:08.898
"Quia audisti vocem,
August Hamilton,"

31:09.076 --> 31:11.739
"te iubeo velum coram me
transire..."

31:11.912 --> 31:14.620
- Xavier.
- Xavier!

31:14.790 --> 31:16.952
- Xavier...
- No, Mictian, you will not pass.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.741
- Xavier...
- Waverly, don't stop. Go.

31:18.919 --> 31:24.836
Um, "Apparueris mihi spiritus
carnem ipsum praecipio tibi."

31:41.400 --> 31:43.392
Ha!

31:43.568 --> 31:49.064
I'll dine on your souls.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.403
Sorry, friend,
that's not on the menu.

31:51.576 --> 31:55.490
No, Doc, wait! Uh... Oh, here!
Try 50,000 volts!

31:55.664 --> 31:57.405
- What?!
- Zap him!

31:57.582 --> 31:59.582
- No! That'll kill him!
- Well, he's gonna kill us!

32:09.719 --> 32:11.506
Wynonna!

32:12.722 --> 32:14.509
Uhh!

32:23.483 --> 32:26.021
Dolls! Dolls! Hey!

32:26.194 --> 32:28.777
Hey! He's not breathing.

32:31.366 --> 32:34.029
Dolls! Wake up! Wynonna! Quick!

32:34.202 --> 32:35.989
- Yeah. Give us room.
- OK.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.784
Alright.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.578
Um...

32:57.976 --> 32:59.763
Come on, Dolls. Please.

33:14.493 --> 33:17.361
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.032
We need to regroup.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.748
Gotta make a plan -
he's gonna come back for you soon.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.332
Wait, I don't get it.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.787
Wynonna shot him right between
the eyes with 'Peacemaker'.

33:29.883 --> 33:33.752
No. He wasn't made flesh.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.137
He was toying with us.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.175
Well, he might be travelling
by mirror,

33:40.352 --> 33:41.968
but he's still a revenant, OK?

33:42.145 --> 33:44.808
His body HAS to exist somewhere.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.938
Ohh!

33:47.984 --> 33:49.441
- Eurgh!
- Oh, my God.

33:49.611 --> 33:50.943
He's coughing up water.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.393
Well, if you give him a bit of laudanum,
he'll be alright.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.447
That's not what I mean. Look!

33:56.451 --> 33:59.444
OK, OK. Water -
that's reflective, right?

33:59.621 --> 34:02.705
OK, so what if his body
is in water?

34:02.874 --> 34:04.911
What if he's using the water
to project himself?

34:05.085 --> 34:08.293
- I feel so smart right now!
- We gotta go. We need to go.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.877
No! You need to sit your ass
down and rest.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.837
We got this, hombre.

34:14.928 --> 34:17.920
Look, she'll need backup.

34:18.931 --> 34:22.300
You mess this up
and I will end you.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.594
I don't mess up.

34:26.022 --> 34:29.436
I seem to recall long ago
some men of negligible character

34:29.609 --> 34:31.440
telling me of a certain lake
they'd go

34:31.610 --> 34:34.319
to make certain problems go away

34:34.489 --> 34:36.481
with an anchor and a chain.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.320
Mm-hm.

34:38.493 --> 34:41.610
What if some scoundrel was paid
to make Mr Hamilton go away?

34:41.788 --> 34:45.748
OK, scoundrel,
what's this lake called?

34:47.627 --> 34:49.914
I guess 'Tiny Muddy Shit-puddle'
was taken.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.670
Yeah. They might have drained
the lake for fracking,

34:52.841 --> 34:55.925
but at least it'll be way easier
for us to find the barber.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.303
Yeah, super easy. There he is.

35:03.143 --> 35:04.930
That's another reflection.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.524
He's here somewhere.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.620
- Wynonna, move!
- I can't! He's done something to me!

35:31.546 --> 35:33.833
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

35:34.007 --> 35:36.750
Forgiven? Or not?

35:36.926 --> 35:39.384
Oh, come on now, Augie,
you know it's me you want.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.295
It was these hands
that secured those chains

35:41.473 --> 35:43.089
and put you in that lake.

35:43.266 --> 35:46.054
Yes. You're the guiltiest of all, Doc.

35:46.227 --> 35:48.685
But you feel no remorse.

35:48.855 --> 35:52.064
- Not like this one.
- Ahh!

35:52.233 --> 35:57.274
Search your heart, Wynonna.
Who have you hurt the most?

35:59.407 --> 36:01.194
It's you.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.443
- Wave, of course, it's you.
- No!

36:04.621 --> 36:06.453
I mean, sure,
you've done dumb stuff,

36:06.623 --> 36:08.285
but you're my sister, OK?

36:08.458 --> 36:11.417
- I'll... I'll always forgive you.
- Not for this.

36:11.586 --> 36:15.045
What wrong have you done
that she could never forgive?

36:15.215 --> 36:17.958
Ugh! Ewww!

36:18.134 --> 36:20.968
I'm... I'm sorry I killed Dad.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.218
I'm sorry I let them take Willa.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.224
Is it 'cause I left?

36:27.394 --> 36:30.432
- Right? I'm sorry!
- No, God, I'm over it, OK?

36:30.605 --> 36:34.098
You came back! You came back
and now you're here.

36:34.275 --> 36:37.143
And... and you're the chosen one and...

36:37.320 --> 36:38.982
That's definitely not
what I'm mad about.

36:39.155 --> 36:42.193
Then what are you...
What do you mean, "the chosen"?

36:43.618 --> 36:46.907
- Wave, just say it. Say it.
- I should be the heir!

36:47.914 --> 36:49.746
Yeah, you should.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.957
- I'm sorry.
- I forgive you.

36:53.128 --> 36:54.994
- Not in your heart.
- I forgive her!

36:55.171 --> 36:56.878
- Say goodbye.
- No!

37:01.469 --> 37:04.428
Guilty, sinner, forgiveness.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.474
Just another dude telling me
what I've done wrong.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.726
But now...

37:11.980 --> 37:13.937
I'm about to do some right.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.627
You sure you're gonna be OK
out here?

37:44.804 --> 37:46.511
Sleeping under the open sky?
I'll be dandy.

37:46.681 --> 37:49.014
But what about you,
little darlin'?

37:49.184 --> 37:51.346
Had yourself
one hell of a pony ride.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.761
Yeah. I'm just glad it's over.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.850
This one cut pretty close
to the bone.

37:56.024 --> 37:58.687
Back in my day,
I wronged many a persons

37:58.860 --> 38:00.726
and some done me wrong in turn,

38:00.904 --> 38:02.520
but the only regret I have

38:02.697 --> 38:05.189
is that I never apologised
to Wyatt.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.858
You told me last time you saw him,
it was all good.

38:08.036 --> 38:11.200
I do not recall what lie I told you.
I was probably drunk.

38:11.372 --> 38:14.206
- It was 8am.
- I was definitely drunk.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.328
I do not have much in this world
besides memories and regret.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.751
It would be nice for you
to have more.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.555
Sorry.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.394
You ate all the corn chips
again?

38:39.567 --> 38:41.399
No.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.026
Yeah.

38:44.239 --> 38:47.323
I'm serious. I'm really sorry
about being the heir.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.108
Pfft! No.

38:49.285 --> 38:52.119
I only said that because
Vidal Sassoon would have killed you

38:52.288 --> 38:54.530
if I didn't find something
to be mad at you about.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.824
- I didn't actually mean it.
- Yeah, you did.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.742
Well, it was a stupid thing
to say.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.752
OK.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.584
We're gonna do this
the hard way.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.373
The bubblegum sake I imported
from Japan!

39:04.551 --> 39:06.838
What... Hey!

39:07.011 --> 39:09.344
- Oh, that's gross.
- It's unique.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.301
Try it.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.520
See? Not... not so bad.

39:18.690 --> 39:23.310
Wave, it's OK to just be honest.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.523
For once.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.154
Fine.

39:32.328 --> 39:36.242
I spent years compiling research
on the revenants.

39:38.209 --> 39:42.078
I did a four-year university degree
by correspondence

39:42.255 --> 39:44.668
on ancient cultures
and languages

39:44.841 --> 39:46.423
because I thought that maybe...

39:47.635 --> 39:50.469
maybe I could break the curse.

39:53.266 --> 39:56.885
And you, who's never tried
to be good at anything in life,

39:57.061 --> 39:58.552
got to be the special one...

40:00.356 --> 40:01.972
while I just got to be Waverly.

40:02.150 --> 40:05.939
Who everybody loves
because you're so awesome.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.648
I mean, you have
a million reasons to hate me

40:10.825 --> 40:12.657
and you still love me.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.532
It's what I love about you, dude.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.203
Pass me the booze.

40:24.464 --> 40:27.081
Isn't this the part
where you say you love me too?

40:30.261 --> 40:33.629
You know, you're awfully needy
for a lone wolf.

40:43.107 --> 40:46.100
Look. Ooh, a cowboy.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.652
Both of you girls, out with ya!

40:57.163 --> 40:58.654
Go on!

41:00.375 --> 41:03.118
I paid them fillies
for the entire evening.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.956
Seems an awful waste.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.712
Too sick to ride with me
to Purgatory,

41:07.882 --> 41:11.000
but here you are, carrying on
like a horse gone to stud.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.339
Your countenance, Doc, it is...

41:13.513 --> 41:16.301
A bona fide miracle. I am cured!

41:19.811 --> 41:22.554
How, Doc? How did you do this?

41:24.649 --> 41:26.436
Sweet mercy.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.226
Have you made a pact
with the devil?

41:29.404 --> 41:31.896
Now, you never mind that.
I am strong again.

41:32.073 --> 41:34.406
Let's fight, let's ride together
like we used to.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.191
I did this for us.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.861
You did it because
you're selfish and a coward!

41:39.038 --> 41:41.200
- All men must die!
- Says who?

41:41.374 --> 41:44.412
C'mon, men like you,
so high and so almighty?

41:44.585 --> 41:47.248
And cursed by hell itself.

41:47.422 --> 41:49.960
I thought they only existed
in fairytales -

41:50.133 --> 41:52.466
angels, devils -

41:52.635 --> 41:54.342
yet demons walk among us

41:54.512 --> 41:56.595
and they mean to end my line.

41:57.724 --> 42:00.933
But what you have done
pains me more.

42:02.937 --> 42:05.145
It's still me, Wyatt.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.146
Your friend, your brother!

42:07.316 --> 42:09.603
Doc Holliday is dead.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.236
And that makes you
nothing but a memory.

42:13.406 --> 42:15.318
One I surely hope to forget.

42:16.305 --> 42:22.498
